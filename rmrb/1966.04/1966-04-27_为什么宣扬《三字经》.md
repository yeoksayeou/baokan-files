    Why Advocate for the *Three Character Classic*	Yu Zhangrui
    In 1962, Comrade Wu Han published his "On the *Three Character Classic*." In this article, Comrade Wu Han praised the *Three Character Classic* highly and complained about its neglect.
    Comrade Wu Han believed that the *Three Character Classic* had many advantages, "very rich content," and was a "small-scale general history of China," a "small-scale encyclopedia." Moreover, the ideological content was good, and the educational significance was even greater. He said: "This book advocates that human nature is inherently good: 'If not taught, nature will change; the way to teach is to value focus.' It also proposes the relationship between family education and school education: 'Nurturing without teaching is the father's fault; teaching without strictness is the teacher's laziness.' ...All of these are reasonable."
    Comrade Wu Han listed various reasons, praised the *Three Character Classic*, and called on everyone to inherit the tradition of the *Three Character Classic* and learn from its advantages.
    Comrade Wu Han's scripture-reading theory gave people a rather "familiar" feeling. It turned out that this was not his new invention, but something inherited from the bourgeois rightists on the cultural front since the May Fourth Movement. However, under the new conditions, Comrade Wu Han had to disguise it more cleverly.
    As early as 1919, when the May Fourth Movement occurred, Hu Shi put forward the slogan of "reorganizing the national heritage" in order to resist the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China. Some followers expressed their opinions one after another, saying that "China has many good things of its own, but they are not being reorganized and preserved. Instead, they are seeking new things, just like abandoning the ancestral heritage, which is unfilial." In September 1925, on the eve of the First Revolutionary Civil War, Sun Shizheng and others published the "saving the country by reading scriptures" theory. In November of the same year, the then Ministry of Education's working conference decided that primary school students must read scriptures from the fourth grade of elementary school, one hour per week, until graduation from higher elementary school. In 1933, the noise of reading scriptures had just passed, and Shi Zhicun, one of the so-called "third kind of people," advised young people to read *Zhuangzi*, *Wen Xuan*, and *Yan's Family Instructions*. This time, it was not under the grand banner of "saving the country," but rather to introduce it to young people as an aid to "literary cultivation" and "moral cultivation." As everyone knows, at this time, it was precisely the time when the domestic counter-revolutionary forces and revolutionary forces were engaged in the struggle of "encirclement and suppression" and "counter-encirclement and suppression." The "third kind of people" vigorously promoted reading scriptures, allowing young people to seek words and phrases in the old paper piles, to cultivate themselves and nourish their nature, and their intention was of course very reactionary.
    Comrade Wu Han's new theory of reading scriptures is precisely a continuation of the reactionary propositions of Hu Shi, Sun Shizheng, Shi Zhicun, and others. The relevant historical facts since the May Fourth Movement tell us that whenever temporary dark clouds appear in the sky and the class struggle deepens, the reactionary and restorationist ideological trends will reappear. This is determined by the law of class struggle.
    Is the *Three Character Classic* really a "good book" as Wu Han boasted? No, absolutely not.
    First, the *Three Character Classic* begins by saying: "At the beginning of man, nature is good." How to view good and evil, different classes have different standards. Leaving aside the class differences of people and talking about the inherent goodness of human nature is to serve the feudal ruling class and set up a big deception for the working people. According to the "reason" of "innate goodness of nature," all uprisings, resistance, etc., that do not conform to the interests of the ruling class are evil, and are due to "If not taught, nature will change." This kind of supra-class theory of the goodness of human nature is precisely an anesthetic that poisons the fighting will of the working people, but Comrade Wu Han said: "This book advocates that human nature is inherently good," "it is reasonable."
    Second, the *Three Character Classic* promotes loyalty, filial piety, chastity, righteousness, the three cardinal guides and five constant virtues, and the nine generations and ten moral obligations. It teaches people to "first filial piety and brotherly love, second to see and hear" - maintaining feudal ethics and morality is the most important, and everything else is secondary. It teaches people to be loyal to the feudal patriarchal system in everything: "The ruler commands the minister, the father leads the son, the husband leads the concubine," "Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and fidelity, these five constants, cannot be abandoned." "These ten moral obligations are shared by all." It is a thorough book that promotes and maintains the feudal patriarchal system, ethics, and morality.
    Third, the *Three Character Classic* teaches people to be enthusiastic about fame and fortune and to dedicate themselves to a prosperous career. It tells people that as long as they study hard, they will have a day to stand out and achieve the goal of bringing glory to their ancestors. For example: "Head hanging from the beam, awl pricking the thigh, he is not taught, but diligent and hardworking." "Learning when young, acting when strong, serving the ruler above, benefiting the people below; spreading fame and reputation, honoring parents, glorifying before, better than after." It is a book for cultivating successors for the feudal landlord class. Comrade Wu Han once promoted to young people that "anyone can become an expert scholar, the key lies in whether he is willing to work hard and whether he can overcome all the difficulties that stand in his way." It is not difficult to see that the secret to success he peddled is precisely the set that the *Three Character Classic* vigorously advocates.
    Furthermore, is the *Three Character Classic* a "small-scale general history of China"? No. The *Three Character Classic* narrates a series of names and successions of feudal dynasties, but it does not clearly narrate the history of feudal society, let alone narrate it correctly. Please see: "The Zhou moved east, the king's laws fell, they indulged in war, and advocated persuasion," what rich content does it give people? "The Yan Song rose, accepted the abdication of the Zhou, eighteen generations, the north and south were mixed," how much historical knowledge does it give people? How many working people have understood it in the past? Who can still gain any historical knowledge from it in the future? Isn't this an obvious thing?
    People can't help but ask: Why did Comrade Wu Han advocate the *Three Character Classic*? Why did he advocate the *Three Character Classic* in 1962? The advocates of saving the country by reading scriptures in the 1920s, as Lu Xun pointed out, did not fail to know that the *Analects* had never moved German soldiers, and the *Book of Changes* could not curse and overturn submarines, but were simply "deliberately acting recklessly" "in a hardened society." So, what is the purpose of the new scripture-reading theorists in the 1960s? Is it merely limited to having everyone recite "At the beginning of man" in today's socialist society?
    The article "On the *Three Character Classic*" appeared in 1962, which was by no means accidental. Around 1962, it was precisely when modern revisionists colluded with imperialists to vigorously oppose China, and domestic right-leaning opportunists, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements took advantage of the temporary difficulties we suffered and attempted to restore and settle accounts. Comrade Wu Han wrongly assessed the situation, thinking that the great opportunity for him to carry out restoration activities had arrived. Therefore, with deep hatred for Marxism-Leninism, he launched one poisonous arrow after another at the Party and socialism, and "On the *Three Character Classic*" was one of them. His purpose was to make the feudal system and ethics and morality rule the people again. This must be exposed and criticized.

    为什么宣扬《三字经》	余章瑞
    一九六二年，吴晗同志发表了他的《谈〈三字经〉》。在这篇文章里，吴晗同志对《三字经》赞扬备至，并为它的被冷落叫屈。
    吴晗同志认为《三字经》有许多优点，“内容非常丰富”，是“小型中国通史”，“小型百科全书”。而且思想内容也是好的，教育意义更是大的。他说：“这书主张人性本善：‘苟不教，性乃迁，教之道，贵以专。’而且提出家庭教育和学校教育的关系：‘养不教，父之过，教不严，师之惰。’……都是有道理的。”
    吴晗同志列举了种种理由，推崇《三字经》，号召大家继承《三字经》的传统，学习《三字经》的优点。
    吴晗同志提出的这个读经论，使人颇有“面熟”之感。原来这并不是他的新发明，而是“五四”以来文化战线上的资产阶级右派一脉相承的东西。不过吴晗同志在新的条件下，不得不伪装得更巧妙一些罢了。
    早在“五四”运动发生的一九一九年，胡适为了抵制马克思列宁主义在中国的传播，提出了“整理国故”的口号。一些附和的人纷纷发表议论，说什么“中国自有许多好东西，都不整理保存，倒去求新，正如放弃祖宗遗产一样不肖。”一九二五年九月，第一次国内革命战争的前夕，孙师郑等发表了“读经救国”论。同年十一月，当时的教育部部务会议决议，规定小学生自初小四年级起必须读经，每周一小时，直至高小毕业。一九三三年，读经的嚣声刚刚过去，所谓“第三种人”之一的施蛰存又劝青年读《庄子》、《文选》、《颜氏家训》了。这一回不是挂起堂而皇之的“救国”的招牌，而是说只介绍给青年作为“文学修养之助”，“道德修养”之助。大家知道，这时候，正是国内反革命势力和革命势力展开“围剿”与“反围剿”的斗争的时候，“第三种人”大肆宣扬读经，让青年到故纸堆中去觅字汇，去修身养性，其用意当然是十分反动的。
    吴晗同志的新读经论，正是胡适、孙师郑、施蛰存等人的反动主张的继续。“五四”运动以来的有关史实告诉我们：每逢天空出现暂时的乌云，阶级斗争深入开展的时候，反动的复古的思潮总会重新出现。这正是阶级斗争的规律所决定的。
    《三字经》果真是如吴晗所吹捧的那样一部“好书”吗？不，绝对不是。
    一、《三字经》开宗明义就说：“人之初，性本善”。怎样看待善同恶，不同的阶级有不同的标准。离开人的阶级差别而讲什么人性本善，就是为封建统治阶级效劳，对劳动人民布设大骗局。根据“性本善”这个“理由”，凡是不符合统治阶级利益的起义、抗争，等等，就都是恶的了，都是由于“苟不教，性乃迁”之故。这种超阶级的性善论，正是毒害劳动人民斗争意志的麻醉剂，而吴晗同志却说：“这书主张人性本善”，“是有道理的。”
    二、《三字经》宣扬忠孝节义，三纲五常，九族十义。它教人“首孝弟，次见闻”——维护封建伦理道德是首要的，其他都是次要的。它教人事事忠诚于封建宗法制度：“君统臣，父领子，夫率嫔”，“曰仁义，礼智信，此五常，不容弃。”“此十义，人所同。”它是一本彻头彻尾宣扬和维护封建宗法制度、伦理道德的书。
    三、《三字经》教人热中名利，致力于仕途显达。它告诉人，只要勤学苦练，就有出头之日，就可达到光宗耀祖的目的。如：“头悬梁，椎刺股，彼不教，自勤苦”。“幼而学，壮而行，上致君，下泽民；扬名声，显父母，光于前，愈于后”。它是一本为封建地主阶级培养接班人的书。吴晗同志曾向青年们宣传，“任何一个人都可以成为专家学者，问题的关键就在于自己是否努力，是否能克服挡在他面前的一切困难。”不难看出，他所贩卖的成功秘诀，正是《三字经》中大力鼓吹的这一套。
    再说，《三字经》是不是一部“小型的中国通史”呢？不是。《三字经》叙述了一串封建王朝的名称和沿袭，但远没有把封建社会的历史叙述清楚，更不用说叙述正确。请看：“周辙东，王纲坠，逞干戈，尚游说”，究竟给人什么丰富的内容？“炎宋兴，受周禅，十八传，南北混”，究竟给人们多少历史知识？以往有多少劳动人民读懂过它？今后谁还能从它获得什么历史知识？这难道不是明摆着的事情吗？
    人们不禁要问：吴晗同志为什么要提倡《三字经》？为什么要在一九六二年提倡《三字经》？二十年代的读经救国论者，正如鲁迅所指出的，不是不知道《论语》何尝感化过德国兵，《易经》不能咒翻潜水艇，不过是“在硬化的社会里”，“故意妄行”罢了。那么，六十年代新读经论者的目的何在呢？它仅仅限于要在今天的社会主义社会里人人都念“人之初”吗？
    《谈〈三字经〉》一文，出现在一九六二年，这绝不是偶然的。一九六二年前后，正是现代修正主义者同帝国主义勾结起来大肆反华，国内右倾机会主义分子、地富反坏分子趁我们遭受暂时困难而企图复辟倒算的时候。吴晗同志错误地估计了形势，以为他进行复辟活动的大好时机到来了。于是他怀着对马克思列宁主义的深刻的仇恨，向党向社会主义放出一支支毒箭，《谈〈三字经〉》就是其中的一支。他的目的就是要使封建制度和伦理道德重新统治人民。对此必须予以揭露和批判。
