    In recent years, the idea of combining agriculture and animal husbandry has been understood and accepted by more and more people throughout the country. Many communes and production teams have made full use of various favorable natural conditions, adopted measures suitable to local conditions, changed the past practice of developing a single economy, and implemented the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, achieving great success in the mutual promotion and simultaneous development of agriculture and animal husbandry. This correct approach embodies the brilliant thought of Comrade Mao Zedong that agriculture and animal husbandry are interdependent, mutually promoting, and should be developed simultaneously.
    The economy combining agriculture and animal husbandry is a progressive, superior, and rational economy. The socialist agricultural economy is not a single economy; it requires both a developed planting industry and a developed animal husbandry, and the developed planting industry is linked and inseparable from the developed animal husbandry. The people need grain, and they also need meat and dairy products; industrial departments need livestock products as raw materials, and animal husbandry has extensive direct links with various departments of the national economy. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that an economy without animal husbandry is an incomplete national economy. We have always emphasized that the development of agriculture should be combined with the development of animal husbandry. This is an objective law of socialist economic construction and a fundamental guiding ideology.
    Practice in various regions has proven that wherever conditions are met and a comprehensive view of combining agricultural development with animal husbandry is truly established in guiding ideology, agriculture and animal husbandry can develop smoothly. Conversely, neither agriculture nor animal husbandry can be well developed.
    How can we establish a comprehensive view of combining agricultural development with animal husbandry? From the practical experience of many regions, it is necessary to constantly criticize and overcome various erroneous ideas of "emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry." Some people think that only agriculture is important, and animal husbandry is not important, pitting planting and animal husbandry against each other and belittling animal husbandry. This is very wrong. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a region where animal husbandry accounts for a large proportion, and herdsmen and many farmers have always had the habit and experience of engaging in animal husbandry. In the vast agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, there are excellent conditions for developing agriculture and animal husbandry. However, even in such areas, the idea of belittling animal husbandry inevitably arises. In the eighteen years since the establishment of the autonomous region, two ideas of belittling animal husbandry have been constantly corrected: one is the "theory of backward pastoral areas," advocating replacing animal husbandry with agriculture; the other is emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry, squeezing animal husbandry with agriculture. Both of these ideas are subjective and one-sided, and are divorced from the masses and reality. Therefore, without thoroughly criticizing this erroneous view of belittling animal husbandry, the idea of combining agriculture and animal husbandry cannot be established at all, and neither agriculture nor animal husbandry can be developed.
    Emphasizing agriculture should not neglect animal husbandry. It is fundamentally impossible for agriculture to develop well if it is separated from animal husbandry. Today, agriculture relies on animal husbandry to provide power, fertilizer, and funds; in the future, agriculture will also need the support of animal husbandry. Whether now or in the future, animal husbandry is an indispensable and important condition for developing agriculture. We can produce many facts of close integration of agriculture and animal husbandry, and common development of agriculture and animal husbandry, but we cannot find any basis for the benefit of agriculture from emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry and separating agriculture and animal husbandry.
    Paying attention to the development of animal husbandry and implementing the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry has far-reaching significance for resisting disasters and preparing for famine, and for better organizing the lives of the people. Because agricultural production cannot completely get rid of the influence of nature, there are good years and lean years. Developing animal husbandry can give full play to the role of mutual support between agriculture and animal husbandry and long-term preparation for famine. Agriculture compensates for pastoral shortages, and pastoral compensates for agricultural shortages. This is the experience of the broad masses in fighting against natural disasters for many years. Developing animal husbandry is also a good way for agricultural and semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas to develop diversified management. More livestock and its meat, hides, and wool can not only increase the income of the masses and improve the lives of the masses, but also increase the accumulation of the collective economy and enhance the material strength of the collective economy. With agriculture and animal husbandry, the masses can gradually become rich and wealth can be stored among the people.
    Does the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry have no priorities? No. From the perspective of the national economy, agriculture is the foundation, and grain is the foundation of the foundation. Agricultural production and grain production should be the priorities. However, we must look at problems from objective reality and cannot be uniform. In agricultural areas, agriculture is the main focus, and developing agriculture is the priority, and developing animal husbandry is to serve agriculture; in pastoral areas, animal husbandry is the main focus, and developing animal husbandry is the priority, and developing agriculture is to serve animal husbandry; in semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral areas, developing agriculture and animal husbandry are equally important and indispensable. Agriculture and animal husbandry can be emphasized differently due to different conditions, but they themselves are inseparable. Emphasizing priorities does not mean that priorities can be developed in isolation. We cannot develop animal husbandry in isolation without the support of agriculture, nor can we develop agriculture in isolation without the support of animal husbandry. If we do not proceed from reality and only emphasize one aspect while ignoring the other, we will inevitably fail to do either aspect well, and it will be fundamentally impossible to have any real priorities.
    Are there contradictions between agriculture and animal husbandry? In the socialist large-scale agricultural economy, agriculture and animal husbandry should be combined, and there are no fundamental contradictions. However, if we only emphasize one aspect while ignoring the other, or only focus on agriculture and not on animal husbandry, or only focus on animal husbandry and not on agriculture, then contradictions will inevitably arise. Either agriculture will not have draft animals, or animal husbandry will not have feed. Of course, to combine agriculture and animal husbandry, it is also necessary to solve specific work arrangements. It should be particularly pointed out here that the ideas that only developing grain is a contribution to the country, and developing meat, hides, and wool is not a contribution to the country; or regarding animal husbandry as dispensable and grasslands as wasteland are one-sided and do not conform to objective reality. It should be understood that grain production is very important, but it does not mean that only producing grain is a contribution to the country. Producing meat, hides, and wool is also a contribution. Grain production is important, but not all areas have the conditions to develop grain. In some areas that are originally suitable for developing animal husbandry, it is necessary to develop grain, which not only has low yields and low income, but also destroys grasslands, destroys pastures, and causes desertification. The correct approach should be to proceed from reality, comprehensively plan, uniformly arrange, adapt to local conditions, and have different priorities according to the conditions and possibilities of each region, so as to truly achieve the combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, mutual support, mutual promotion, and common development. This is more beneficial to the country and the people, and it is the greatest contribution to the country and the people.
    Currently, agricultural and animal husbandry production is facing a great situation throughout the country, and a new production upsurge has arrived. We must follow Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant thought that agriculture and animal husbandry are interdependent, mutually promoting, and should be developed simultaneously, adhere to giving prominence to politics, correct the erroneous idea of emphasizing agriculture and neglecting animal husbandry, truly achieve emphasizing both agriculture and animal husbandry, combine agriculture and animal husbandry, and continuously promote the great development of agricultural and animal husbandry economy.

    重农不能轻牧
    最近几年以来，在全国各地，农业同畜牧业结合的思想，已为越来越多的人所理解、所接受了。许多公社和生产队，充分利用各种有利的自然条件，采取适合当地情况的措施，改变了过去那种发展单一经济的做法，实行农业同畜牧业相结合，取得了农业和畜牧业互相促进、同时发展的巨大成就。这种正确作法，体现了毛泽东同志所提出的农业和畜牧业互相依存、互相促进、同时并举的光辉思想。
    农业同畜牧业结合的经济，是一种进步的、优越的、合理的经济。社会主义的农业经济，不是单一的经济，它既需要有发达的种植业，也需要有发达的畜牧业，而发达的种植业又是同发达的畜牧业互相联系、不可分割的。人民需要粮食，同时需要肉食、奶食；工业部门需要畜产品做原料，畜牧业同国民经济各部门有着广泛的直接的联系。毛泽东同志指出，没有畜牧业的经济，是一种不完全的国民经济。我们历来强调发展农业要同发展畜牧业相结合。这是社会主义经济建设中的一个客观规律，也是一个根本的指导思想。
    各地实践证明，凡是具备条件，在指导思想上真正树立了农业同畜牧业相结合的全面观点的，农业和畜牧业就能得到顺利发展。反之，农业和畜牧业就都得不到很好的发展。
    怎样树立发展农业同发展畜牧业相结合的全面观点呢？从许多地区的实践经验看来，必须不断地批判和克服各种“重农轻牧”的错误思想。有人以为只有农业重要，畜牧业不重要，把种植业和畜牧业对立起来，轻视畜牧业。这是十分错误的。内蒙古自治区是一个畜牧业比重较大的地区，牧民和许多农民历来有经营畜牧业的习惯和经验，在广大的农区和半农半牧地区，发展农业和畜牧业具有极好的条件。然而，即使是在这样的地区，也不免出现轻视畜牧业的思想。从自治区建立以来的十八年中，曾经不断地纠正两种轻视畜牧业的思想：一种是“牧业落后论”，主张以农代牧；一种是重农轻牧，以农挤牧。这两种思想都是主观片面的，是脱离群众和脱离实际的。因此，不彻底地批判这种轻视畜牧业的错误观点，农牧结合的思想就根本树立不起来，农业和畜牧业就都不可能得到发展。
    重农不能轻牧。农业离开了畜牧业，要想得到很好的发展，是根本不可能的。在今天，农业要靠畜牧业提供动力、提供肥料和提供资金；在将来，农业同样需要畜牧业的支持。不论现在和将来，畜牧业都是发展农业必不可少的重要条件。我们可以拿出许许多多农牧密切结合、农牧业共同发展的事实，但是找不到一条重农轻牧、农牧分家对农业会有什么好处的根据。
    重视发展畜牧业，实行农业牧业相结合，这对于抗灾备荒，对于更好地组织人民的生活，具有深远的意义。由于农业生产还不能完全摆脱自然的影响，就有丰年，有歉年。发展畜牧业可以充分发挥农牧业互相支援、长期备荒的作用，农歉牧补，牧歉农补，这是广大群众多年来对自然灾害做斗争的经验。发展畜牧业又是农区和半农半牧区开展多种经营的一种很好的形式，牲畜和它的肉、皮、毛多了，不仅可以增加群众的收入，改善群众的生活，而且可以增加集体经济的积累，增强集体经济的物质力量。有了农业，又有了畜牧业，群众就可以逐渐地富裕，就可以藏富于民。
    农牧结合，是不是没有重点呢？不是。从全国国民经济来说，农业是基础，粮食是基础的基础，农业生产、粮食生产应当是重点。但是，我们看问题要从客观实际出发，不能千篇一律。在农区，以农为主，发展农业就是重点，发展畜牧业是为农业服务；在牧区，以牧为主，发展畜牧业就是重点，发展农业是为畜牧业服务；在半农半牧地区，发展农业同发展畜牧业同等重要，缺一不可。农业和畜牧业可以因条件不同而有所侧重，它们本身却又不可分割。强调重点绝不是说可以孤立地发展重点。既不能脱离农业的支援，而孤立地发展畜牧业；又不能脱离畜牧业的支援，而孤立地发展农业。如果不从实际出发，只强调一面，而忽视另一面，势必哪一面也搞不好，也就根本不可能有什么真正的重点。
    农业和畜牧业有没有矛盾呢？在社会主义的大农业经济中，农和牧这两者应该是结合的，并不存在什么根本的矛盾。但是，只强调一面，而忽视另一面，或者只抓农、不抓牧，或者只抓牧、不抓农，那就必然出现矛盾，不是农业没有耕畜，就是畜牧业没有饲料。当然，要使农牧结合起来，还需要解决工作上的具体安排问题。在这里特别应当指出，认为只有发展粮食才是对国家的贡献，发展肉、皮、毛就不是对国家的贡献；或者把牧业看作可有可无，把草原视为荒地，这些思想都是片面的，不符合客观实际的。应当了解，粮食生产十分重要，但并不是说只有生产粮食才是对国家的贡献。生产肉、皮、毛也同样是贡献。粮食生产重要，但也不是所有地区全都有条件发展粮食。在一些本来适合发展畜牧业的地区，硬要发展粮食，不仅产量不高，收入很低，而且会破坏草原，破坏牧场，造成沙化。正确的做法应当是，从实际出发，根据各个地区的条件和可能，全面规划，统一安排，因地制宜，各有重点，真正做到农牧结合，相互支援，相互促进，共同发展。这样做，对国家、对人民更为有利，是对国家、对人民最大的贡献。
    当前，在全国各地，农牧业生产面临着一派大好的形势，一个新的生产高潮已经到来。我们要遵循毛泽东同志关于农业和畜牧业互相依存、互相促进、同时并举的光辉思想，坚持突出政治，纠正重农轻牧的错误思想，真正做到重农又重牧，农牧结合，不断地促进农业和畜牧业经济的大发展。
