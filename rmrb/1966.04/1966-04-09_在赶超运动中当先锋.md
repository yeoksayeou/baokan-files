    Take the Lead in the Catch-Up Movement
    Shanghai Engineering Machinery Factory　Wang Shanping
    The pawl pin groove on the 180 kg pile driver used to be machined on a slotting machine, and the quality has never been stable. It was a long-standing difficult problem in our factory. Everyone shook their heads when they saw this kind of work. Once, a girl named Xiao Li who worked on the slotting machine cried because too many parts were scrapped. The inspector saw that the work was really difficult and lowered the standards invisibly. Therefore, the quality of qualified products was not completely reliable.
    Since the Party put forward the call to improve product quality and catch up with the advanced technical level at home and abroad, Xue Jindi, a Five-Good employee in our factory, thought: The problem of machining the pawl pin groove must be solved, otherwise, how can we make the pile driver we produce catch up with the world's advanced level? With this question in mind, he went to brother units such as the Shanghai Hoisting and Transportation Machinery Factory to learn from their experience. He saw that the pin grooves of small gears were processed on a broaching machine, with good quality and high speed. He thought: Can't the pawl pin groove also be processed on a broaching machine? But our factory doesn't have a broaching machine. Some technicians suggested making one; but that broaching machine was imported and would cost tens of thousands of yuan. Master Xue said: "We must take our own path and make a domestic one, which will be faster and save the country's funds." After returning, Master Xue used the body of an old planer to make a domestic broaching machine himself, and also made a set of templates and fixtures. Now a pawl pin groove can be broached in less than a minute, and the groove is smooth, bright, and fully meets the quality requirements. Xiao Li, who used to work on the slotting machine, switched to broaching the pawl and said with a smile: "With Master Xue leading us, we are more confident in catching up with the world's advanced level."

    在赶超运动中当先锋
    上海工程机械厂　王善平
    一百八十公斤打桩机上的棘轮的销子槽，过去是用插床加工的，质量一直不能稳定，是我厂一个老大难的问题。谁见到加工这种活都摇头。有一次做插床的姑娘小李，因为报废的太多了，心疼得哭起来。检验员看到活实在难做，也就无形中降低了标准。因此，在合格品中质量也不是完全过得硬的。
    自从党提出了提高产品质量，赶超国内外先进技术水平的号召以来，我厂五好职工薛金弟师傅想：加工棘轮销子槽的问题一定要解决，不然怎能使我们生产的打桩机赶超世界先进水平呢？他带着这个问题，到上海起重运输机厂等兄弟单位去取经。看到人家小齿轮的销子槽是在拉床上加工的。质量又好，速度又快。他想：棘轮的销子槽不也可用拉床加工吗？但是我们厂没有拉床。有的技术人员建议做一台；但那拉床是进口的，造价要几万元。薛师傅说：“我们要走自己的路，做一台土的，时间既快，还可节约国家资金。”回来以后，薛师傅利用旧刨床的机身自己做了一部土拉床，还做了一套靠模和夹具。现在一只棘轮的销子槽不到一分钟就拉好了，而且槽子又光又滑又亮，完全符合质量要求。做插床的小李改做拉床加工棘轮后，笑哈哈地说：“有薛师傅带领我们，赶超世界先进水平就更有信心了。”
