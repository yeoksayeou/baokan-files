    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 8th April: The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on the 7th regarding the Thai army's occupation of the ancient Cambodian temple of Preah Vihear, pointing out that the Thai government is increasingly becoming a tool of U.S. imperialism, which is attempting to rule the peoples of Southeast Asian countries through war.
    The statement said that a Thai army of about fifty men launched an attack on the Cambodian post guarding the Preah Vihear temple in Preah Vihear province at nearly 19:30 on the 3rd. The Thais occupied the temple, burned the post, and captured the five guards. Cambodian troops who went to reinforce the attacked post exchanged fire with the enemy, and one person was injured.
    The statement said: "This Thai offensive is another incident in a series of Thai incursions into Cambodian territory in recent months, involving killings and robberies. These repeated provocations, as in September 1940, are clearly a prelude to a large-scale aggression against Cambodia."
    The statement requested "international public opinion to pay attention to the extreme seriousness of this new act of aggression by the Thai armed forces, which is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter and the International Court of Justice's ruling of 1962." The statement pointed out that the International Court of Justice's decision of June 15, 1962, had already recognized Cambodia's sovereignty over the Preah Vihear temple.
    The statement said: "Thailand's aggression exposes the double-dealing of the Thai Foreign Minister, Thanat Khoman, who said just a few days ago that his country would not use force to occupy the Preah Vihear temple."
    The statement said that the Royal Government "requests all international organizations and countries that uphold justice and love peace to compel the Bangkok government to immediately cease its acts of war against Cambodia. As for Cambodia, it is prepared to deal with the dangerous situation on its borders."
    The statement said, "The Royal Government once again draws international public opinion's attention to the belligerent and expansionist actions of the Bangkok government. This government has increasingly become a tool of Washington imperialists who are trying to rule the peoples of Southeast Asian countries by means of war."
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 8th April: According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 8th, Cambodian troops recovered the peak where the ancient temple of Preah Vihear is located on the morning of April 6th, after it was occupied by Thai troops a few days earlier.
    Cambodian soldiers exchanged fire with Thai troops near the first archway of the Preah Vihear temple. After a considerable and fierce resistance, the Thai troops retreated back into their own territory.
    Currently, Cambodian troops are stationed around the Preah Vihear temple and in defensive positions along various passages. About two hundred meters beyond the barbed wire in front of the Cambodian troops, about three hundred Thai troops are stationed.
    According to a report by the news agency on the 8th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk wrote a letter to Lieutenant General Lon Nol, Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces, congratulating the Cambodian troops and police who recovered the Preah Vihear temple.
    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 5th April: According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 5th, from 7:30 p.m. on April 3rd to the early hours of the 4th, Thai troops attacked and burned the Cambodian post guarding the Preah Vihear temple. They also abducted several Cambodian guards. Several people on the Cambodian side were also injured.
    The Preah Vihear temple is located in Kampong Thom province of Cambodia near the Thai border and was once occupied by Thailand. On June 15, 1962, the International Court of Justice ruled that the Preah Vihear temple belonged to Cambodia.
    The Cambodian News Agency also reported on the 5th that on the evening of the 4th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Norodom Sihanouk specially summoned Lieutenant General Lon Nol, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of Cambodia. During the meeting, they studied from a military perspective for a long time the problems caused by the unacceptable occupation of the Preah Vihear temple by Thai troops. The Head of State also wrote a letter to the government headed by Prince Kantol, asking him to study the issue politically and diplomatically.
    The Cambodian News Agency said that Cambodia will take measures to safeguard Cambodia's territorial integrity at all costs.
    According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency on the 5th, on the morning of March 31, Thai troops stationed at the Thai Hale post, under the cover of two warships, used heavy weapons and automatic weapons to fire at Cambodian territory in Koh Kong province. Cambodian soldiers fiercely retaliated with all weapons, forcing the invaders to cease firing. In the afternoon of the same day, the two Thai warships again used heavy weapons and automatic weapons to fire at Cambodian territory. The Cambodian side retaliated again.

    柬政府呼吁各国制止泰国侵略
    谴责泰国政府充当美帝国主义工具侵占柬领土
    柬埔寨军队击退入侵泰军并收复隆端古寺
    新华社金边八日电　柬埔寨王国政府七日就泰国军队侵占柬埔寨隆端古寺事件发表声明指出，泰国政府已越来越成为企图用战争手段来统治东南亚各国人民的美帝国主义的工具。
    声明说，一支五十来人的泰国军队在三日将近十九时半向柏威夏省守卫隆端古寺的柬埔寨哨所发动进攻。泰国人曾经占领这所古寺，烧毁了哨所，并且俘虏了哨所的五名守卫者。前往被袭击的哨所增援的柬埔寨军队与敌人进行了交火，有一人负伤。
    声明说：“泰国的这次进攻，是最近几个月以来泰国人在多次侵入柬埔寨领土进行屠杀和抢劫之后的又一次事件。他们一再进行的这种挑衅，正如一九四○年九月的情况一样，显然是对柬埔寨进行大规模侵略的前奏”。
    声明要求“国际舆论注意泰国武装部队的这种新的侵略行动的极端严重性，这种行动是对联合国宪章和海牙国际法院一九六二年裁决的明目张胆的破坏”。声明指出，国际法院一九六二年六月十五日的决定已经承认柬埔寨对隆端古寺的主权。
    声明说：“泰国的侵略暴露了曼谷外交部长他纳·科曼的两面手法，他在几天以前还说，他的国家不会使用武力占领隆端古寺。”
    声明说，王国政府“要求所有主持正义和爱好和平的国际组织和国家，迫使曼谷政府立即停止它对柬埔寨的战争行动。至于柬埔寨，它准备对付它边境上的危险局势”。
    声明说，“王国政府再次提请国际舆论注意曼谷政府的好战的和扩张主义行动。这个政府已经越来越成为企图用战争手段来统治东南亚各国人民的华盛顿帝国主义者的工具。”
    新华社金边八日电　据柬埔寨新闻社八日报道，柬埔寨军队四月六日凌晨收复了前几天被泰国军队侵占的隆端古寺所在的山峰。
    柬埔寨士兵在隆端古寺的第一道牌坊附近同泰国军队进行了交火，泰国军队在经过相当激烈的抵抗后，退回自己境内。
    目前，柬埔寨军队驻扎在隆端古寺周围和各条通道的防御阵地上。在柬埔寨军队前方铁丝网那一边约二百米的地方，驻有约三百名泰国军队。
    据这家通讯社八日报道，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王写信给柬埔寨王家武装部队总司令朗诺中将，对收复隆端古寺的柬埔寨军队和警察表示祝贺。
    新华社金边五日电　据柬埔寨新闻社五日报道，四月三日夜七时三十分到四日凌晨，泰国军队袭击和烧毁了守卫隆端古寺的柬埔寨哨所。他们还劫走了几名柬埔寨守卫者。柬埔寨方面还有几个人受伤。
    隆端古寺在柬埔寨磅同省靠近泰国边境的地方，曾被泰国霸占。一九六二年六月十五日国际法院裁决隆端古寺属于柬埔寨。
    柬埔寨新闻社五日还报道，四日晚上，柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王特别召见了柬埔寨内阁副首相兼国防大臣朗诺中将。召见时，他们长时间地从军事上研究了由于泰国军队不可容许地占领隆端古寺所引起的问题。国家元首还写信给康托尔亲王主持的政府，请他从政治上和外交上研究这一问题。
    柬埔寨新闻社说，柬埔寨将采取措施，不惜一切地维护柬埔寨的领土完整。
    据柬埔寨新闻社五日报道，三月三十一日上午，驻扎在泰国哈勒哨所的泰国军队在两艘军舰的掩护下，用重武器和自动武器向柬埔寨戈公省领土射击。柬埔寨士兵用一切武器猛烈还击，迫使侵略者停止射击。同日下午，这两艘泰国军舰再次用重武器和自动武器向柬埔寨领土射击。柬埔寨方面再次还击。
