    What Counts as "Not Afraid of Hardship" and "Not Afraid of Death"?
    Hebei Kailuan Mining Bureau, Yu Chengli
    In our work, situations like this often occur: some people, after blasting, don't "knock on the walls and check the roof" before going in to work; knowing the roof is bad, they don't put up temporary supports. When others tell them that it's too dangerous, they reply, "We must learn from Comrade Wang Jie's spirit of fearing no death for the revolution!" They even call others cowards, afraid of death.
    Comrade Wang Jie persistently studied Chairman Mao's works. In his work, he demanded much of himself and was strict with himself, never shying away from hardship and danger, daring to take on heavy burdens, until he contributed his precious youth to protect the lives of his class brothers. This fully demonstrates the spirit of a communist revolutionary fighter who, for the cause of the Party and the people, for the revolution, is "not afraid of hardship" and "not afraid of death." This spirit is worth learning from forever.
    However, those who do not observe order, do not observe discipline, disregard specifications and quality, and disregard safety in production are not demonstrating the "not afraid of hardship" and "not afraid of death" that we advocate, but rather a manifestation of irresponsibility towards the Party and the people. Doing so will only bring unnecessary sacrifices and losses to the country. This is what we oppose. When we learn from Comrade Wang Jie's revolutionary spirit of "not afraid of hardship" and "not afraid of death," we must learn with correct class viewpoints and standpoints.

    什么才算“不怕苦”与“不怕死”？
    河北开滦矿务局　于成立
    在我们的工作中，时常有这样的事情：有的人放炮以后，也不进行“敲帮问顶”，就进去工作；明知顶板不好，也不打临时支柱。别人告诉他，这样作太危险！他却回答：“我们要学习王杰同志为革命不怕死的精神。”还说别人是胆小鬼，怕死。
    王杰同志坚持不懈地学习毛主席著作。在工作中从难、从严要求自己，不避艰险，敢挑重担，直到为了掩护阶级弟兄的生命贡献出自己的宝贵青春。这充分表现了一个共产主义革命战士为了党和人民的事业，为了革命“不怕苦”和“不怕死”的精神。这种精神是值得我们永远学习的。
    但是，那些不遵守秩序、不遵守纪律、不顾规格质量、不顾安全生产，并不是我们提倡的“不怕苦”、“不怕死”，而是对党和人民不负责任的表现，那样作只能给国家带来不必要的牺牲和损失。这是我们所反对的。我们学习王杰同志“不怕苦”、“不怕死”的革命精神，必须带着正确的阶级观点和立场来学习。
