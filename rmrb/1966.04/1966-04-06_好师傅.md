    The Yangtze River, waves upon waves,
    Countless are the heroic figures,
    Let's not speak of the Former Qin or Later Han dynasties,
    But tell a tale of our railway hero.

    Today I'm going to talk about an advanced figure, Chen Dekun, a switch operator in the Nanjing Railway Bureau's ferry operation area, known as the Red Sentinel. Some of you might say, "Hey, you said switch operator, how did he become a sentinel?" Well, switch operators are almost like sentinels. Look at him, standing beside the crisscrossing switches, with eyes watching in all directions and ears listening to all sides. Whether it's a foggy day or a snowy night, he's always standing there, watching for any signs of trouble like a sentinel guarding against the enemy. A little negligence and things could go wrong. How? When the train reaches a fork in the road, which track it takes is entirely up to the switch operator. If he throws the wrong switch, the train that should go straight will turn, the one that should turn left will turn right. If things go wrong, and there's another train on that track, they'll crash. Oh, a train wreck is no laughing matter! Master Chen's No. 9 switch house is right at the ferry entrance of Pukou Station. The train ferry connects the north and south of the Yangtze River, and there are five switches on this crucial transportation hub. Trains come and go very frequently. You just hear "Woo-woo..." a train comes, "Woo-woo..." another train leaves, truly as dense as a shuttle, as fast as an arrow! If outsiders stand here for a while, they'll get dizzy. But Master Chen, for more than ten years, has moved the switches more than a million times, and he has never had an accident! However, I won't talk about all of that today. Why? If I start talking about it, it would take at least seven days and seven nights, and you'd have to roll out your bedding and set up shop here! Today, I'll just talk about Master Chen training his apprentice.

    Who is this apprentice? He's Master Chen's newly accepted apprentice, named Zhou, Xiangqian, a junior high school graduate, just turned eighteen this year. Don't underestimate young Zhou because of his age, he's got skills. He can sing and dance, write and draw, studies well, and works hard too. In a word, he's a vibrant, idealistic, lively young man.

    It is said that when young Zhou was assigned to work on the railway last May, he was overjoyed. He thought: Great, I'm now a member of the glorious working class, ready to dedicate myself to the great cause of building socialism! When he heard the leader announce that he would be assigned to the advanced worker Master Chen as an apprentice, he was even more delighted, jumping three feet high, almost hitting the ceiling! Joy upon joy, excitement upon excitement, this night went wrong. What's wrong? Over-excitement, insomnia! He tossed and turned in bed, like a pancake, until almost dawn. Just as he was dozing off, he suddenly heard someone shout: "Master Chen is here!" Young Zhou quickly jumped up, and saw a man striding down the road outside the door, with a sturdy build and strong limbs, hey! He looked like a half-cut black tower, almost on par with Wu Song! Without waiting for an introduction, young Zhou dashed two steps to Master Chen and shouted "Master!" shaking his hands vigorously. At this moment, he heard "Bang... Crash!" What happened? It turned out to be a dream. He was grabbing the leg of the bedside table and shaking it hard, causing the washbasin and toothbrush cup on the table to fall off!

    Naturally, young Zhou couldn't sleep any more, luckily the day was gradually dawning. Young Zhou finished his breakfast in two or three bites, and was led to meet his master. Upon meeting, young Zhou was stunned. The master's appearance was far from what he imagined in his dream! The master wasn't tall, young Zhou quietly compared, he was half a head shorter than himself; and he wasn't burly, his back was even a little hunched - this was because Master Chen was overworked like an animal in the old society. Only one thing was the same, Master Chen's voice was very loud - this was something he had practiced hard. As a switch operator, the calls and responses must be clear and loud to ensure safe train operation. Master Chen shouted late at night: "Yellow flag to be thrown, locking block down, no flag, points tightly closed, track three cleared, okay!" This shout could be heard two miles away, so everyone called him "Shout-to-the-Sky". So, young Zhou looked at his master, recalled the scene in his dream, and couldn't help but smile foolishly at his master. Master Chen felt that this apprentice was a bit special, why was he just smiling without saying a word? "I say, young Zhou, what are you laughing at?" "Hehe, Master, I dreamed about you last night!" "Ah?" "But, it's different from how you really look!" "Ah, how so?" Young Zhou told his master what he had seen in his dream. "Hehe!" the master laughed: "Ah, you think I'm like Li Kui or Wu Song! I say, young Zhou, we workers aren't heroes from Liangshan. The heroes in 'Water Margin' can't do our job!" What Master Chen said made sense, that's right, even if Li Kui was a famous hero on Liangshan, if he came to our railway to be a worker, he would definitely become an accident king! As for Wu Song? Even if he was a hero for fighting only one tiger, our railway workers have overcome thousands of difficulties! Enough digressions, so Master Chen said to young Zhou: "Child, it's not easy to be a real worker, you have to practice hard!" "Yes, Master!" Young Zhou puffed out his chest, "I'll practice however you tell me to, and I promise not to let you down!"

    From that day on, young Zhou began to practice hard skills with his master. He was clever, and willing to work hard, and he indeed made rapid progress. Soon, he learned the whole set of skills of a switch operator. The joy in young Zhou's heart went without saying, but as a result, he unconsciously relaxed. He thought: Great, I'm almost there now, I can probably be considered a real worker! In a fit of joy, he thought of something: he had a good friend, named Xiao Wu, who was a basketball player, now working as a machinist in a factory in Suzhou. Young Zhou thought: I should write a letter to my good friend, and tell him about my achievements, so he can be happy too. But how should I write this letter? No amount of words could express the joy in his heart. Young Zhou's eyes rolled: I've got it! I'll just paint a picture and send it to him with a poem! As mentioned before, young Zhou was multi-talented. Sure enough, he painted a watercolor painting, and this painting was so lifelike. Look: a young man stands with his chest out, legs apart, standing beside the switch, holding a signal flag in his hand, his eyes looking into the distance; in the distance, there are clouds of smoke, that's the train speeding by; behind the young man is the tall and large ferry bridge, and behind the bridge is the vast Yangtze River; the river water is shimmering in the sunlight, you can almost hear the sound! Hey, this painting is really well painted, it's like a dog biting a duck - it's fantastic! Unfortunately, there's one thing that's not quite right - what is it? There's only one young man in the painting, missing a master. Why didn't he paint him? Young Zhou felt that he was almost there, he could be considered a real worker!

    At that time, young Zhou threw the "letter" into the mailbox with great pride, and waited for a reply. But after waiting for four or five days, there was no sign of it. Young Zhou was secretly angry: This guy Xiao Wu, how could he forget his old friend! On this afternoon, a passenger train was boarding the ship, coming close. Young Zhou was holding the flag, when he suddenly heard a voice: "Xiao Zhou, Xiao Zhou!" He looked up and saw a person on the passenger train stretching his neck, leaning out of the window, and waving to him! Who was this person? It was his good friend Xiao Wu. It turned out that Xiao Wu had already received his "letter", and was about to reply, when the factory sent him and a few others to a factory in Tianjin to learn technology. Xiao Wu was also a mischievous person, and thought: Wouldn't it be great if this train passing through the river also passed through Xiao Zhou's switch? I won't reply to his letter, I'll just give him a "surprise attack" when I pass him, and give him a gift so he can be happy too! Yes, yes, that's the idea! Sure enough, young Zhou suddenly saw Xiao Wu, so happy that he forgot everything, and didn't even hear his master's shout. He ran after the carriage: "Ah, it's you! My letter—" "Received it, received it! Your painting is great! Quick, catch!" As he spoke, Xiao Wu threw down a package! Young Zhou was stunned, and didn't catch it, "Bang" the package fell to the ground, broke, and a few oranges bounced out, one rolling right next to Master Chen's feet. Young Zhou was about to bend over to pick it up, but unexpectedly, "Bang!" the master stomped on the orange! He shouted: "Quickly restore the switch!" At this moment, young Zhou came to his senses. He secretly looked at his master, and saw that his master's face was pale, and his expression was very serious. "Master," young Zhou bit his lip and said, "I I I..." "While on duty, we'll talk after work!"

    Young Zhou looked at his master's expression, and his heart really wasn't feeling good: Alas, the master was usually so kind to him, and had never been so angry before! What was there to say? He could only blame himself for being so dizzy! However, I was just careless for a moment. Xiao Wu greeted me, how could I ignore him? Besides, I only ran away two steps, and there was no accident. The master's anger was too, too much! ...

    While young Zhou was muttering to himself, he heard a shout: "Dad, Dad!" Master Chen's eldest daughter ran over, sweating profusely, out of breath. "Dad, something bad happened!" "What is it?" "Alas, my younger brother broke his leg and was sent to the hospital!"

    "Ah!" "The hospital wants you to go, Dad, go see him quickly!" Master Chen thought for a moment and said: "No! I can't leave. Like this, you go see your brother!" "Alas, the hospital wants a parent to go! They say the injury is not light! Dad, please go quickly!" "No, I can't—" Master Chen hadn't finished saying the word "go", when young Zhou shouted: "Master, go ahead, I'm here!" "No!" Young Zhou thought: What's wrong? Oh, the master probably doesn't trust me much! "Hey, Master, rest assured and go! I will keep my eyes open as big as copper bells, and guarantee that there won't be the slightest accident!" Who knew that the master still shook his head. Young Zhou was so anxious that he just clicked his tongue. He glanced at the clock in the switch house and saw that it was 19:00, he quickly said: "Hey, there's only half an hour left until you get off work, Master, hurry and go!" "No!" the master said firmly: "Don't talk about half an hour, we can't leave our post for even a minute!" He turned his face and said to his daughter: "Child, don't worry, the hospital now belongs to our people. You go first, Dad will come after work." He just sent his daughter away like that. Young Zhou was very moved, but the more moved he was, the more uneasy he became: Look, Master Chen watched his son go to the hospital and didn't leave his post, but what about himself? Alas, a package of oranges made me dizzy! I was just muttering in my heart just now, thinking that the master was too much, it seems, hey, it's my thinking that's too much! ... Thinking, thinking, young Zhou's thoughts turned to the master's child. Alas, I don't know if his leg is broken, or dislocated? Dislocation is easier to treat, but if the bone is broken, it's troublesome! Thinking of this, he couldn't help but blurt out: "Master!" "What is it?" "I, I was thinking, I don't know..." He said half a sentence, looked at the master's expression, and swallowed the rest of the sentence back into his stomach. The master said: "Young Zhou, don't let your thoughts run wild, we not only can't leave our post, but we can't let our thoughts leave our post for even a minute! Thousands of vehicles pass through our switches every day, some supporting agriculture, some supporting the border regions, even our Chairman Mao has passed by us on the train! Think, if there's even the slightest mistake, is that okay? Child, once we step onto our post, we have to be immovable! - Oh, the train is coming, throw the switch!"

    In this way, Master Chen insisted until he got off work. After handing over the shift, young Zhou grabbed the master and ran to the hospital. He thought that the master's child wouldn't have anyone to take care of, who knew that the ward was already crowded with people, some from the hospital, some from the school, and some from the workers' family committee. As for the child? He was also out of danger. It turned out that the doctors heard that Master Chen was so selfless, and were all moved. The hospital director personally took charge, and led the doctors to rescue the child from danger.

    At this moment, Master Chen was relieved, and happily took young Zhou and his daughter back. After walking a few steps, young Zhou suddenly stopped, and said softly: "Master..." "What's wrong, young Zhou?" "I, I was wrong..." It turned out that young Zhou remembered picking up the oranges, "cough, I thought I had learned enough, so my thoughts... alas!" "Alright, alright!" the master said with a smile, "You can't learn to walk without falling. It's good that you know you were wrong and can correct it! But, child, you have to remember: Learning the switch operating technique, you may be able to cope with it in a few months, but practicing the ideology of the working class takes a lifetime! - Okay, let's go quickly! When we get home, eat our fill, and we'll have a good chat!"

    That night, Master Chen kept young Zhou and slept on the same bed. The master and apprentice chatted for half the night. The master compared the past, talked about the suffering of the older generation, and also talked about his hopes for the youth, wishing he could stuff his heart into his apprentice's chest!

    To make a long story short, young Zhou's awareness continued to improve under the master's words and deeds. The master's set of hard skills, such as "manual interlocking" and "a look back is worth a thousand gold", he learned each one seriously. He carried "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" with him at all times, learning and applying it flexibly. With his heart enlightened, he worked diligently, and his eyes no longer looked around like he was hunting wild ducks.

    In the blink of an eye, it was the end of the year, and Master Chen was going to Beijing to attend the advanced representative meeting of railway workers. His shift was taken over by young Zhou. Master Chen wiped the signal lamp he had used for more than ten years again and again, and washed the two red and yellow flags until they were clean, and handed them all over to his apprentice. The master and apprentice were about to part, and they had countless words to say, which I won't elaborate on one by one.

    Let me just say that on the night before Master Chen left, he thought about the past, thought about today, and couldn't sleep for a long time. He also thought about his apprentice, feeling that young Zhou had made rapid progress recently, but after all, he had not been tempered enough, and he had to demand more strictly. After thinking left and right, he finally fell asleep. In the second half of the night, he was suddenly awakened by a sound, "Whoosh... Whoosh..." like a lion's roar, like a tiger's howl, listening carefully, it turned out to be the north wind whistling with snowflakes. Ah, a cold wave is coming! Suddenly a cold wave came, I wonder if young Zhou can hold on? ... Thinking, thinking, he quietly put on his clothes and got up. As soon as he went out, the north wind was even stronger, coming in gusts. Master Chen wrapped his cotton coat tightly, and leaned his body, step by step toward the No. 9 switch house, and it took him half a day to get there.

    At this time, the marshalling yard was brightly lit by the lighthouses. Under the lights, wisps of cold mist floated. The colorful signal lights flickered, as if they were blinking because they were frozen. The entire ferry bridge entrance, at this time, only had one place that was warmest. Where? The switch house, the switch house had a raging fire. According to regulations, the switch operator could go inside to warm up before the train arrived. But what about young Zhou? Master Chen looked up and saw that his apprentice was standing spiritedly beside the switch, his head, body, and eyebrows all covered with a white layer, like a small evergreen pine that would not bend under the snow or wither under the frost. All of this was just like when he was there. The master couldn't help but shout in his heart: "Good, well done!"

    Master Chen didn't disturb young Zhou. He watched silently for a while, and felt relieved. Just as he was about to turn back, he heard a clear signal bell: "Ding, ding, ding!" Master Chen knew that this was a locomotive going to the ferry boat to pick up a car. Sure enough, "Kakaka..." a locomotive was coming straight to the third switch. But, he didn't know how, the searchlight on the locomotive suddenly shone on the second switch to the right. Hey, that's not right! How is it heading for track two? That's terrible, the No. 8 switch house in front must have thrown the wrong switch! At this time, three boxcars full of sulfuric acid were parked on the second switch. Sulfuric acid is a dangerous product, if the locomotive crashes into it, it will explode and catch fire. Hey! Master Chen felt a heat in his heart, and all the blood rushed to his face! He was about to open his mouth to shout, telling the No. 8 switch house in front to correct it, when he heard a shout: "Hey—" It turned out that his apprentice had also noticed, and shouted first. However, as soon as the shout "Hey" came out, young Zhou coughed. What happened? He was choked by the wind. The north wind was like a knife, almost choking the blood out of his throat! The No. 8 switch house was more than twenty cars away, and it was against the wind, even if you shouted until your throat was hoarse, they wouldn't hear it!

    In the nick of time, the locomotive was still "Kakaka..." heading straight for the sulfuric acid car! At this time, there was only one way, turn on the red signal light, and tell the driver to brake urgently. Master Chen was about to raise the light, ah, his hands were empty, the light had already been handed over to his apprentice! He turned his head quickly, just as he was about to shout to young Zhou, a flash of red light flashed before his eyes, and his apprentice had already raised the light high above his head! This light, ah, he had used it for more than ten years, and had just wiped it again and again yesterday and handed it over to his apprentice. Under the red light, young Zhou stood tall in the wind, his eyes shining brightly. What he was holding up was not an ordinary light, but a red heart of the working class! The driver saw the red light, and immediately braked urgently. He only heard a "Kacha" sound, sparks were splashing under the wheels, and then he reined in the galloping iron horse, avoiding a serious car accident. This is truly:

    The Yangtze River, waves upon waves,
    Master and apprentice are both heroes,
    The red light shines on their hearts,
    The revolutionary tradition is passed down from generation to generation! (Attached picture)

    好师傅〔革命故事〕
    南京铁路文化宫业余创作组　集体创作
    南京铁路分局　刘富华　执笔
    长江水，浪叠浪，
    风流人物千千万，
    不说前秦与后汉，
    把咱铁路英雄讲一段。
    今天我要讲的先进人物，是南京铁路分局轮渡作业区的一位主任扳道员、人称红色哨兵的陈德坤。各位会说，哎，你不是讲扳道员嘛，怎么又成了哨兵啦？嗳，这扳道员跟哨兵差不多。你看他，站在纵横交叉的道岔旁，眼观四路，耳听八方；不论雾天，也不论雪夜，总是站在那儿，象哨兵警戒敌情一样，注视着每一点事故苗子。要是稍微疏忽一下就糟了，怎么？这火车到了岔道口，该走哪股钢轨，全靠扳道员掌握，要是扳错了道，该直走的就拐了弯，该往左转的就往右转，弄得不巧，这边道上正好有趟车，那火车就要相撞。咳，这火车打架可不是闹着玩的呀！陈师傅工作的九号扳道房，正好在浦口车站轮渡的口口上。火车轮渡联系着大江南北，在这个咽喉要道上，有五股道岔，火车来往十分紧张，只听见：“呜呜……”一班车来了，“呜呜……”又一班车去了，真是密如穿梭，快似射箭！外面的人要是在这里站上一会儿，准会头昏眼花，可陈师傅十多年来，扳动了一百多万次道岔，却从来没有出过一次事故！不过，这些今天我全不讲，为啥？要是讲开了，起码得七天七夜，那各位就得卷着铺盖、带着锅碗在这里落户啦！今天，我只讲陈师傅带徒弟这一段。
    这个徒弟是谁呀？是陈师傅新收的，姓周，名向前，初中毕业生，今年刚满十八岁。你别看小周年纪小，他可有两下子，能歌能舞，能写会画，学习好，劳动也不错。一句话，是个有朝气、有理想、鲜蹦活跳的小伙子。
    话说小周去年五月分配到铁路上工作，心里乐开了花，心想：好哇，我这就成为光荣的工人阶级一分子，要投入建设社会主义的洪流了！一听领导宣布把他分配给先进生产者陈师傅当徒弟，更是喜得一蹦三尺高，差点儿把天花板给撞个窟窿！喜上加喜，兴奋加兴奋，这天晚上就糟了，怎么啦？兴奋过度，失眠啦！他在床上翻过来，复过去，跟烙饼似的，直到五更头上才迷糊着。刚迷糊着一会儿，猛听见有人喊：“陈师傅来啦！”小周连忙跳起来，只见门外路上，大步流星来了一个人，熊腰虎背、粗壮有力，嘿！长得跟半截黑塔似的，简直跟武松不相上下！小周不等别人介绍，两步蹿到陈师傅面前，喊了声“师傅！”抓住他双手直摇。这时，只听见“咣……啪！”——怎么啦？原来是做梦，他双手抓住床头的桌腿使劲地摇，把桌上的洗脸盆、漱口杯给摇下来啦！
    这一来，小周自然更睡不着了，幸亏天也渐渐亮了。小周两嘴三口吃完了早饭，就被领着去见师傅。一见面，小周愣了，师傅的模样跟梦里的差远啦！师傅的个儿并不高，小周悄悄一比，比自己还差半个头；更不是熊腰虎背，背还有点驼——这是陈师傅在旧社会里做牛马给累伤的。只是有一点，陈师傅的嗓门很洪亮——这是他苦练出来的，当扳道员的，呼唤应答要清楚响亮，才能保证行车安全。陈师傅深夜里呼唤一声：“黄牌要扳，闭子块落下，无牌，尖轨密贴，三道开通，好啦！”这喊声两里路外都听得见，因此大家都叫他“喊破天”。且说，当下小周打量打量师傅，回想梦里的情景，不由瞅着师傅傻呵呵地笑了。陈师傅觉得这徒弟有点儿特别，怎么见面一句话不说光傻笑呢？“我说，小周，你笑什么呀？”“嘿嘿，师傅，我昨晚就梦见你啦！”“啊？”“不过，跟你真模样可不一样！”“啊，怎么？”小周就把梦里所见告诉了师傅。“嗬嗬！”师傅笑了：“啊，你把我当成李逵、武松了！我说，小周，咱们工人不是梁山好汉啊，《水浒》里的英雄可干不了咱们这活儿！”陈师傅这话说得有理，可不是，别看李逵是梁山上鼎鼎有名的英雄，要是到咱们铁路上当个工人，非成事故大王不可！武松呢？他再英雄只打过一只虎，可咱们铁路工人却克服过千万件困难！闲话少说，且说陈师傅当下对小周说：“孩子，当个真正的工人可不容易，你得好好练啊！”“是，师傅！”小周把胸脯一挺，“你怎么说，我就怎么练，保证不辜负你的希望！”
    从这天起，小周就跟师傅练起硬功夫来了。他心灵手巧，又肯努力，果然进步很快，不久，就学会了扳道员的一套操作本领。小周心里的那份高兴，就不用说了，可这一来，也就不知不觉松了劲。他想：好呀，我这下差不多了，大概能算个真正的工人啦！一高兴，他便想起了一件事：他有个要好的同学，叫小吴，是个篮球健将，如今在苏州一个厂里当车工。小周心想：该给好朋友去封信，把自己的成绩告诉他，叫他也乐一乐。可这封信怎么写呀？再多的字，也写不尽他那份高兴的心情。小周眼珠子一转：有了！我干脆画它一幅画儿，再配首诗寄了去！前面说过，小周是多才多艺的。果然，他画了一幅水彩画，这画画得活灵活现。你瞧：一个小伙子挺着胸，叉开腿，站在道岔旁，手里拿着信号旗，两眼望着远方；远方冒着一团团的烟云，那是列车在飞奔；小伙子身后，是又高又大的轮渡铁桥，铁桥后面，是一派浩浩荡荡的长江；江水在阳光下直晃荡，好象连声音都听得见！嗨，这画儿画得真好，真是狗咬鸭子——刮刮叫！可惜，就是有一点不象——哪点呀？画上只有一个小伙子，缺了个师傅。为啥不画上呢？小周觉得自己差不多了，能算个真正的工人了嘛！
    当时小周十分得意地把“信”往邮筒里一扔，就等待回音。可等了四、五天，连个影儿也不见。小周暗自生气：小吴这家伙，怎么把老朋友给忘啦！就在这一天下午，一趟客车上船，擦身开来。小周正举着旗子呢，猛听见一声：“小周，小周！”抬头一看，只见客车上有个人把脖子伸得老长，探出窗外，正在跟他打招呼呢！这个人是谁？就是他那好朋友小吴。原来，小吴已经收到了他的“信”，正要回信，厂里派他跟几个人上天津一家厂里去学技术。小吴也是个小调皮，心想：这趟车过江不正好要经过小周的道岔吗？我不回信了，干脆，等经过他面前时，给他来个“突然袭击”，丢下一份礼，叫他也乐一乐！对，对，就是这个主意！果真，小周猛然一见小吴，高兴得把什么都给忘了，连师傅的喊声也没听见。他跟着车厢跑去：“啊，是你呀！我的信——”“收到啦，收到啦！你那画儿真好！快，接着！”说着，小吴就把一个纸包给扔了下来！小周一愣，没接着，“啪”纸包摔在地下，破了，几个橘子蹦蹦跳跳地滚了出来，一个正好滴溜溜地滚到陈师傅脚旁。小周正要弯腰去拾，没料到，“啪！”师傅一跺脚把橘子给踩了！喝道：“赶快恢复道岔！”这时候，小周才清醒了过来。偷偷瞧瞧师傅，只见师傅脸色铁青，神情十分严肃。“师傅，”小周咬紧嘴唇说，“我我我……”“执行任务，有话等下了班再说！”
    小周看看师傅的神色，心里真不是股滋味：唉，师傅平日待自己多和气，从来没发过这么大的火！有什么说的呢？只怪自己昏了头！不过，我只是一时大意呀，小吴跟我打招呼，我能不睬人家吗？再说，我只跑开两步，又没出什么事故，师傅这火气也太、太那个了！……
    这边小周心里正嘀咕着，只听见那边一声：“爹，爹！”陈师傅的大女儿跑来了，跑得汗珠子直滴，上气不接下气。“爹，不好啦！”“什么事呀？”“唉，弟弟把腿摔坏了，送了医院！”
    “啊！”“医院要你去，爹，你快去瞧瞧！”陈师傅想了一想，说：“不！我走不开。这样，你去瞧瞧弟弟吧！”“唉，人家医院叫家长去呀！说是伤得不轻哩！爹，你就快去吧！”“不，我不能——”陈师傅这一个“去”字还没出口，小周就叫了起来：“师傅，你去吧，这儿有我！”“不！”小周心想：怎么啦？哦，师傅大概是对我不大放心！“嗨，师傅，你就放心去吧！我一定把眼睛睁得象铜铃大，保证不出半点事故！”哪知道，师傅还是摇头。小周急得只啧嘴，一抬眼，扳道房里的挂钟到了十九点了，忙说：“哎，只有半个钟头就下班了，师傅，你就快走你的吧！”“不！”师傅斩钉截铁地说：“别说半个钟头，咱们一分钟也不能离开岗位！”他转过脸，跟女儿说：“孩子，你别急，如今医院是咱们人民的。你先去，爹下了班就来。”就这么把女儿打发走了。小周心里十分感动，可越感动就越不安：你看，陈师傅眼睁睁地看着儿子进了医院也不离开岗位，可自己呢？唉，一包橘子就给弄得蒙头转向了！自己刚才心里还嘀咕，觉得师傅太那个了，看来，咳，是自己思想太那个了！……想着，想着，小周心里又转到师傅的孩子身上去了。唉，他的腿不知是摔断了，还是脱了臼？脱了臼还好治，要是断了骨就麻烦了！想到这儿，他不由脱口唤了声：“师傅！”“什么事呀？”“我，我在想，不知道……”他说了半句，瞧瞧师傅的神情，就把下半句话咽回肚里去了。师傅说：“小周呀，你思想别跑野马哟，咱们不但身子不能离开岗位，思想也不能一分钟离开岗位啊！咱们道岔每天有几千辆车经过，有支援农业的，支援边疆的，连咱们的毛主席也曾经乘车路过咱们身旁！你想，要是出了半点差错还行吗？孩子，咱们脚一踏上岗位，就要做到雷打不动啊！——哟，车来啦，扳道！”
    就这样，陈师傅一直坚持到下班。交完了班，小周拉着师傅撒开腿就往医院跑去。他满以为师傅的孩子没人照应，哪知道，病房里早挤满了人，有医院的，有学校的，还有工人家属委员会的。孩子呢？也脱离了危险。原来，医生们听说陈师傅这样公而忘私，都被感动了，医院院长亲自出马，带着医生把孩子从危险中抢救了过来。
    这时，陈师傅放下了心，高高兴兴带着小周跟女儿往回走。走了几步，小周突然停住了脚，低低唤了声：“师傅……”“怎么啦，小周？”“我，我错了……”原来小周想起拾橘子那件事了，“咳，我以为自己学得差不多了，思想就……唉！”“好啦，好啦！”师傅笑着说，“不摔跤学不会走路嘛，你能知错改错就好！不过，孩子，你要记住：学扳道技术，你也许几个月就能对付得了，可练工人阶级的思想，得花上一辈子啊！——好，快走吧！到了家，吃饱饭，咱们再好好儿聊聊！”
    当晚，陈师傅把小周留下，睡在一张床上。师徒俩呱哒了半宿。当师傅的比过来，说过去，谈了老一辈受的苦，又谈到了对青年人的希望，恨不得把自己的一颗心都塞到徒弟的胸膛里去！
    长话短说，小周在师傅的言教身教之下，觉悟果然不断提高。师傅的那套硬功夫，什么“人力连锁”呀，“千金难买回头望”呀，……他一一认真学习。《毛泽东选集》呢，更是随身带着，活学活用，这心一亮，干起活来就扎实了，两只眼再也不跟打野鸭子似地东张西望了。
    一眨眼，到了年底，陈师傅要上北京去出席铁路工人的先进代表会议。他的班，就由小周顶了。陈师傅把用了十几年的信号灯擦了又擦，又把那两面红黄旗洗得干干净净，统统交给了徒弟。师徒俩要分手了，自有千言万语，这些就不一一细说了。
    单说陈师傅临走前的这一夜，他想想过去，想想今天，好半天睡不着。又想想徒弟，感觉小周近来进步是很快，但究竟锻炼不够，还要更严格地要求他。左想右想好容易才迷迷糊糊睡去。到下半夜，忽然被一种声音惊醒了，“呼……呼……”又象狮吼，又象虎啸，侧耳一听，原来是北风卷着雪片在呼啸。啊，寒流来啦！突然来了寒流，不知小周这孩子能挺得住么？……想着，想着，他就悄悄穿衣爬了起来。一出门，北风更猛，一阵紧似一阵。陈师傅裹紧了棉衣，侧着身子，一步一步朝九号扳道房走去，半天才走到。
    这时，调车场被灯塔照得雪亮。灯光下，浮动着一股一股的寒雾。各色的信号灯一闪一闪，好象冻得也直眨巴眼睛。整个轮渡桥口，这时只有一个地方顶暖和。哪儿呀？扳道房，扳道房里有熊熊的火炉。按规定，车没到，扳道员是可以进屋取暖的。可小周呢？陈师傅抬眼一看，只见徒弟精神抖擞地站在道岔旁边，头上，身上，眉毛上，都是白白的一层，象是一棵雪压不弯、霜打不黄的小青松。这一切，都跟他在场的时候一个样。做师傅的不由暗暗喊了声：“好，好样的！”
    陈师傅没惊动小周。默默看了一会儿，放了心，正想往回走，只听得一阵清脆的信号铃声：“叮，叮，叮！”陈师傅知道这是有机车要上轮渡船取车了，果然，“咔咔咔……”一台机车迎面向第三股岔道开来。可是，不知怎么弄的，机车头上的探照灯忽然向右面第二股岔道照去。咦，不对！怎么朝二股开呀？糟了，一定是前面那个八号扳道房扳错了道岔！这时，第二股岔道上正停放着三节装满硫酸的棚车，硫酸可是危险品，要是机车照那上面一撞，就会爆炸起火。嗨！陈师傅只觉得心口一热，满腔的血都涌到脸上来了！他正要张嘴高呼，叫前面八号扳道房改正过来，只听见一声喊：“哎——”原来徒弟也察觉了，抢先喊了起来。可是，一声“哎”才出口，小周就咳了起来，怎么？给风呛住了。那北风跟刀子一样，差点把他的喉咙呛出了血！那八号扳道房，离这儿有二十多个车皮远，又是逆风，你就是嗓子喊破了，他也听不见呀！
    说时迟，那时快，只见那辆机车还是“咔咔咔……”照样朝硫酸车直闯过来！这时，只有一个办法了，打开红色信号灯，叫司机紧急刹车。陈师傅正待举灯，啊，自己两手空空，灯早交给徒弟啦！他急忙掉转头，正要喊小周，一片红光在眼前一闪，徒弟早已把灯高高举过头顶！这盏灯啊，是他用了十几年、昨天才擦了又擦交给徒弟的。红灯下，只见小周迎风挺立，两眼炯炯发光。他举的不是一盏普通的灯，而是工人阶级的一颗红心啊！司机看见了红灯，急忙紧急刹车，只听得“咔喳”一声，车轮下火花四溅，才勒住了这头狂奔的铁马，避免了一场恶性撞车事故。这真是：
    长江水，浪叠浪，
    师徒都是英雄汉，
    红灯照在心坎上，
    革命传统代代传！（附图片）
