    Indonesian Armed Forces Collude with Mobs to Seize the Military Attaché's Office of Our Embassy and Attack Our Embassy Dormitory
    Our Government Lodges the Strongest Protest with the Indonesian Government
    Solemnly Points Out That the Recent Serious Incidents of Chinese Representative Offices Being Attacked and Seized Were Entirely Orchestrated by the Indonesian Government
    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th: The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on April 25th, lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government regarding the extremely serious incident of the Indonesian armed forces colluding with mobs to seize the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy and attack the embassy dormitory. The note pointed out that the recent serious incidents of Chinese representative offices being attacked and seized were entirely orchestrated by the Indonesian government. The full text of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note is as follows:

    To the Indonesian Embassy in China:
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its compliments to the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China and makes the following statement regarding the extremely serious incident of the Indonesian armed forces colluding with mobs to seize the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy and attack the embassy dormitory:

    At 8:00 a.m. on April 21, 1966, a group of Indonesian mobs, carrying daggers, iron bars, and other weapons, attacked and seized the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy with the cooperation of personnel from the Siliwangi Division of the Indonesian armed forces, carrying out wanton destruction and looting, and writing anti-China slogans and "Yani Battalion Headquarters" on the walls and gates. They also illegally detained Liu Zhi, the Chinese Embassy-designated caretaker of the house, and his family until April 23rd, when they were forcibly sent to the Chinese Embassy.

    At 2:00 a.m. on April 23rd, about 40 soldiers from the 5th Military Region of the Indonesian Army, together with a group of armed mobs, attacked and looted the Chinese Embassy officials' dormitory located at 4 Lawu Street, Jakarta. They jumped over the wall and broke into the rooms, ransacking the place, and subjected Guo Haohe, Zhang Nengzhen, Chen Baoshou, and others designated by the Chinese Embassy to take care of the house to all kinds of threats and arbitrary beatings. These Indonesian soldiers and mobs carried out searches and destruction in the Chinese Embassy dormitory for as long as four hours, stealing a large number of furniture and belongings.

    After the Indonesian government organized armed mobs to continuously seize the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy, the office and dormitory of the Chinese Consulate General, and the embassy dormitory, it has now occupied the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy and attacked the embassy dormitory. At the same time, Mr. Suwito, the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, openly declared that the mobs who seized the office and dormitory of the Chinese Embassy and Consulate General were "revolutionary" and "progressive" youths, and even clamored that these houses of the Chinese Embassy would be "supervised" by the wielders of two people's orders. This further shows that the recent serious incidents of Chinese representative offices being attacked and seized were entirely orchestrated by the Indonesian government. The Chinese government lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government against this.

    The Chinese government demands that the Indonesian government immediately withdraw the soldiers and mobs who have seized the Chinese diplomatic representative offices, compensate for all losses, ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, and effectively guarantee the safety of Chinese representative offices and their personnel.

    With the highest respect.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, Jakarta News: After the Indonesian army and right-wing mobs destroyed and forcibly occupied the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Chinese Embassy, the Chinese Embassy dormitory, and the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, the Indonesian government again instructed the armed forces to cooperate with right-wing mobs to attack and seize the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy and another dormitory of the embassy on the 21st and 23rd.

    At 8:00 a.m. on April 21st, more than 20 mobs, armed with daggers, iron bars, water pipes, and other weapons, climbed over the wall and entered the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy, using force to threaten the embassy-designated personnel responsible for taking care of the house, and forcibly confining his family of six in a small room. Subsequently, this group of mobs wantonly carried out destruction and looting. They smashed windows, ransacked the place, burned books and newspapers, and wrote anti-China slogans on the walls. They also robbed furniture, electric fans, displays, etc., using large trucks to transport them many times. Even the personal belongings and money of the personnel taking care of the house were robbed by this group of mobs.

    At noon that day, three soldiers from the Siliwangi Division of West Java came to the military attaché's office of the Chinese Embassy, guarding the gate for the right-wing mobs. By noon on the 23rd, there were still fifty or sixty mobs entrenched in the military attaché's office, and four soldiers were guarding the gate for this group of mobs with three machine guns. The mobs also wrote in large characters at the gate "Yani Battalion Headquarters" (belonging to the reactionary "United Action Front of Indonesian University Students").

    At 2:00 a.m. on April 23rd, about 40 soldiers from the 5th Military Region surrounded a dormitory of the Chinese Embassy at 4 Lawu Street, Jakarta. Six mobs armed with short guns immediately climbed over the wall and entered the yard. Two of the mobs climbed onto the platform on the second floor, using guns to threaten Guo Haohe and others, the embassy-designated personnel responsible for taking care of the house, and wantonly slandering and defaming China. The mobs searched the dormitory for four hours, finding nothing, and went out to report the situation to the soldiers surrounding the Chinese Embassy dormitory. Immediately, more than 20 soldiers led more than 20 plainclothes agents rushed into the room again, searching everywhere, and robbing wall clocks, telephones, furniture, and personal belongings. When Guo Haohe and others protested the robbers' actions, the mobs beat them with gun butts and drove Guo Haohe's family and the Indonesian washerwoman to the street. Subsequently, the army forcibly occupied the Chinese Embassy dormitory under the pretext of "protection." As of the morning of the 23rd, they were still illegally entrenched there.

    印尼武装部队配合暴徒强占我大使馆武官处和袭击我大使馆宿舍
    我国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议
    严正指出，最近连续发生的中国代表机构被袭击和被强占的严重事件，完全是印尼政府一手制造的
    新华社二十五日讯　中国外交部二十五日向印度尼西亚驻华大使馆递交了一份照会，就印度尼西亚武装部队配合暴徒强占中国大使馆武官处和袭击大使馆宿舍的极端严重事件向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会指出，最近连续发生的中国代表机构被袭击和被强占的严重事件，完全是印度尼西亚政府一手制造的。中国外交部的照会全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆致意，并就印度尼西亚武装部队配合暴徒强占中国大使馆武官处和袭击大使馆宿舍的极端严重事件，申述如下：
    一九六六年四月二十一日上午八时，一批印度尼西亚暴徒，携带匕首、铁棍等凶器，在印度尼西亚武装部队西利万吉师人员的配合下，袭击和强占中国大使馆武官处，大肆进行破坏和抢劫，并且在墙上和大门上涂写反华标语和“亚尼营司令部”字样。他们还把中国大使馆指派看守房屋的人员刘枝及其家属非法扣押到二十三日，才把他们强行送到中国大使馆。
    四月二十三日清晨二时，印度尼西亚陆军第五军区官兵约四十人，伙同一批武装暴徒，袭击和抢劫了位于雅加达拉武街四号的中国大使馆官员宿舍。他们跳墙闯入室内，翻箱倒柜，并且对中国大使馆指派看守房屋的人员郭浩和、章能振、陈宝守等人进行百般威胁和任意殴打。这些印度尼西亚军人和暴徒，在中国大使馆宿舍进行搜掠破坏达四小时之久，抢走了大批的家具和财物。
    印度尼西亚政府组织武装暴徒连续强占了中国大使馆商务参赞处、中国总领事馆办公处、宿舍和大使馆宿舍之后，现在又霸占了中国大使馆武官处和袭击大使馆宿舍。与此同时，印度尼西亚外交部副部长苏维托先生，还公然宣称，强占中国大使馆和总领事馆办公处和宿舍的暴徒是“革命的”“进步的”青年，甚至叫嚷什么中国大使馆这些房屋将由两项人民命令掌权者“监督”。这又进一步说明，最近连续发生的中国代表机构被袭击和被强占的严重事件，完全是印度尼西亚政府一手制造的。对此，中国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府立即撤走强占中国外交代表机构的军人和暴徒，赔偿一切损失，保证今后不再发生类似事件，切实保障中国代表机构及其人员的安全。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。

    一九六六年四月二十四日
                      于北京
    新华社二十四日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚军队和右派暴徒破坏和强行占领中国大使馆商务参赞处、中国大使馆宿舍和中国驻雅加达总领事馆之后，印度尼西亚政府又在二十一日和二十三日指使武装部队配合右派暴徒，袭击和强占了中国大使馆武官处和大使馆另一处宿舍。
    四月二十一日上午八时，有二十多名暴徒，手持匕首、铁棍、水管等凶器，翻墙进入中国大使馆武官处，用武力威胁使馆指派看守房屋的人员，并把他一家六口强行关在一间小房里。随后，这批暴徒就大肆进行破坏和抢劫。他们砸毁窗户，翻箱倒柜，焚烧书报，在墙上涂写反华标语。他们还抢劫家具、电扇和陈列品等，用大卡车搬运多次。连看守房屋的人员的私人衣物和钱财也被这批暴徒抢走。
    当天中午，西爪哇的西利万吉师军人三名前来中国大使馆武官处，在门口为右派暴徒们警卫。到二十三日中午，仍有五、六十名暴徒盘踞在武官处，并有四名军人架三挺机枪为这批暴徒看守大门。暴徒们还在大门口用大字写着“亚尼营司令部”（属于反动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”）。
    四月二十三日清晨二时，第五军区军人约四十名包围了雅加达拉武街四号的中国大使馆一处宿舍，六个手持短枪的暴徒随即翻墙入院，其中两个暴徒并爬上二楼平台，用手枪威胁使馆指派看守房屋的人员郭浩和等人，并且大肆诬蔑和诽谤中国。暴徒们在宿舍内翻查了四个小时，一无所获，就出门向包围中国大使馆宿舍的军人报告情况，随即又有二十多名军人带领二十多名便衣特务再度冲进房间，到处搜查，并且抢劫了房内壁钟、电话机、家具和私人财物。当看守房屋的人员郭浩和等抗议暴徒们的强盗行为时，暴徒们就用枪柄殴打他们，并把郭浩和的家属和印尼籍的洗衣工人赶到大街上。随后，军队就以“保护”为名强行占领了中国大使馆宿舍。到二十三日早晨为止，他们仍然非法盘踞在那里。
