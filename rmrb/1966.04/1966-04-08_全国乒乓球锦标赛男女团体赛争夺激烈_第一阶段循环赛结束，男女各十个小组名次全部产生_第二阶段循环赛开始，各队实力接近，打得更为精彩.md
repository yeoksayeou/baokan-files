    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 6th) The first stage group round-robin matches of the 1966 National Table Tennis Championships for Men's and Women's Teams concluded here tonight. The rankings of all ten groups for both men and women have been determined.

    The ten teams that secured the first place in the men's groups are: Shanghai First Team, Beijing First Team, Hubei Team, Jiangxi Team, Hebei First Team, Jilin Team, Shanghai Second Team, Sichuan Team, Guangdong First Team, Jiangsu First Team.

    The ten teams that secured the first place in the women's groups are: Shanghai First Team, Sichuan Team, Guangdong First Team, Shandong First Team, Beijing Second Team, Beijing First Team, Shanghai Second Team, Hubei Team, Liaoning First Team, Shanxi Team.

    These twenty teams will compete through the second and third stages to determine the top ten rankings for men's and women's teams.

    After yesterday's first day of competition, all teams seized the time to conduct summaries and further achieved "knowing yourself and knowing your opponent." Therefore, today's competition appeared even more intense. The Jilin team, which ranked sixth in the men's team event at the Second National Games, played against the Anhui team, which ranked seventeenth, from 9:05 PM to 12:05 AM tonight. After three hours of fierce fighting, the Jilin team won 5-3.

    Under the strong "challenge" of young table tennis players from various regions, many strong teams experienced risks in the competition, and some even suffered defeats. The Beijing Women's Second Team, composed of Shi Fengling, Hao Furong, and Wang Biling, defeated the Jilin team, which ranked fifth in the women's team event at the Second National Games, and secured the first place in their group, entering the ranks of the top ten in the country. The Shanghai Women's Second Team, composed of Zhou Yiling, Lin Xiuying, Xu Ruowei, and Hu Xincheng, after defeating the Anhui team, which ranked fourteenth in the women's team event at the Second National Games, with a score of 3-1 yesterday, defeated the Jiangsu team, which ranked seventh in the women's team event at the Second National Games, with a score of 3-2 today, also securing the first place in their group.

    The match between the Sichuan Women's Team, the runner-up in the women's team event at the Second National Games last year, and the Fujian Women's First Team, which ranked nineteenth, took two hours to determine the winner. The Fujian Women's First Team lost the first two games but then won back-to-back games, tying the score at 2-2. In the crucial fifth game, Zheng Huaiying, a sixteen-year-old newcomer from the Fujian First Team, engaged in a fierce offensive battle with Yan Guifen, a veteran from the Sichuan team. In the end, Zheng Huaiying lost with a close score of 1-2. The Henan team, which ranked eighteenth in the men's team event at the Second National Games, also demonstrated a tenacious fighting style in today's match against the Hebei First Team, which ranked fifth. Zhao Jixian of the Henan team defeated Wang Zhiliang, a famous player from the Hebei First Team, with a score of 2-1.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th) The second stage group round-robin matches of the 1966 National Table Tennis Championships for Men's and Women's Teams began today. Because the teams in the seven groups for men and women are of relatively similar strength, the competition appears even more intense and exciting than the first stage group round-robin matches.

    In the twenty-one men's team matches held today, nineteen matches went to six to nine games before the winner was decided; in the twenty-four women's team matches, thirteen matches went to four to five games before the outcome was clear.

    In the two groups formed by the first-place teams from the ten men's groups in the first stage, intense battles emerged. Among them, the results of the three matches in the first group were: Shanghai First Team, the national champion last year, defeated Sichuan Team, which ranked eighth, with a score of 5-1; Jiangxi Team, which ranked fourth, lost to Sichuan Team with a score of 3-5; Hebei First Team, which ranked fifth, defeated Guangdong First Team, which ranked ninth, with a score of 5-3; the results of the three matches in the second group were: Beijing First Team, the national runner-up last year, defeated Shanghai Second Team with a score of 5-2; Hubei Team, which ranked third, defeated Shanghai Second Team with a score of 5-3; Jilin Team, which ranked sixth, lost to Jiangsu First Team, which ranked tenth, with a score of 1-5. Yu Changchun of the Shanghai First Team lost to Ma Jinbao of the Sichuan Team with a score of 0-2 today. Guo Zhonggong of the Beijing First Team lost to Yao Zhenxu and Liu Hengshu of the Shanghai Second Team with scores of 0-2 and 1-2, respectively.

    In the women's team second group, the Shanxi team, which ranked eleventh in the country last year and is composed of Qiu Baoqin and Yu Xiuping, drew attention by defeating the Beijing First Team, which ranked sixth and is composed of Li Li, Liu Yaqin, and Li Xiulin, with a score of 3-0. Both of these Shanxi players grip their rackets horizontally; one is able to chop and attack, and the other is an all-attack type. They controlled the initiative for most of the time in the matches. The results of the other two matches in the women's second group were: Sichuan Team, the national runner-up last year, and Guangdong First Team, which ranked third, defeated Shanghai Second Team with scores of 3-1 and 3-0, respectively.

    Three matches were also held in the women's first group. Shanghai First Team, the national champion last year, defeated Hubei Team, which ranked eighth, with a score of 3-0; Hubei Team defeated Shandong First Team, which ranked fourth, with a score of 3-2; Liaoning First Team, which ranked ninth, defeated Beijing Second Team with a score of 3-0.

    The teams competing for places after the top ten in both the men's and women's categories are also working hard and striving to move up, resulting in several matches that were difficult to determine the winner.

    全国乒乓球锦标赛男女团体赛争夺激烈
    第一阶段循环赛结束，男女各十个小组名次全部产生
    第二阶段循环赛开始，各队实力接近，打得更为精彩
    据新华社上海六日电　一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛男、女团体赛第一阶段分组循环赛今晚在这里结束。男、女各十个小组的名次全部产生。
    获得男子各小组第一名的十个队是：上海一队、北京一队、湖北队、江西队、河北一队、吉林队、上海二队、四川队、广东一队、江苏一队。
    获得女子各小组第一名的十个队是：上海一队、四川队、广东一队、山东一队、北京二队、北京一队、上海二队、湖北队、辽宁一队、山西队。
    这二十个队将经过第二和第三阶段比赛决定男、女团体前十名的名次。
    经过昨天第一天的比赛后，各队都抓紧时间进行了总结，进一步做到了“知己知彼”，因此今天的比赛显得更加激烈。第二届全国运动会男子团体第六名吉林队同第十七名安徽队从今晚九点零五分一直打到十二点零五分，经过三个小时的激战，吉林队以五比三获胜。
    在各地乒乓球小将们的强力“挑战”下，许多强队在比赛中都经历了一番风险，有的甚至失利。由石凤玲、郝富荣、王碧玲组成的北京女子二队，战胜了第二届全运会女子团体第五名吉林队以后，取得了小组第一名，进入全国前十名的行列。由周一玲、林秀英、徐若玮、胡新成组成的上海女子二队，继昨天以三比一赢了第二届全运会女子团体第十四名安徽队以后，今天又以三比二战胜了第二届全运会女子团体第七名江苏队，也取得小组第一名。
    去年第二届全运会女子团体亚军四川女子队同第十九名福建女子一队的一场比赛，打了两个小时才分胜负。福建女子一队先输两盘后，连扳回两盘打成二平。在关键的第五盘中，福建一队十六岁的新手郑怀颖同四川队老将鄢桂芬展开了激烈的对攻战，最后郑怀颖仅以一比二的接近比分失利。第二届全运会男子团体第十八名河南队今天在同第五名河北一队的比赛中，也表现出顽强的战斗风格。河南队的赵辑贤曾经以二比一赢了河北一队名将王志良。
    据新华社上海七日电　一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛男、女团体赛第二阶段分组循环赛今天开始，由于分在男、女各七个组内的各队实力比较接近，因此比赛显得比第一阶段分组循环赛更加激烈、精彩。
    今天进行的二十一场男子团体赛，有十九场打了六盘到九盘才分胜负；二十四场女子团体赛，有十三场打了四盘到五盘才见高低。
    由第一阶段男子十个小组第一名的各队参加的两个组中，都出现了激战场面。其中第一组的三场比赛结果是：去年全国冠军上海一队以五比一胜第八名四川队，第四名江西队以三比五败给四川队，第五名河北一队以五比三胜第九名广东一队；第二组的三场比赛结果是：去年全国亚军北京一队以五比二胜上海二队，第三名湖北队以五比三胜上海二队，第六名吉林队以一比五败给第十名江苏一队。上海一队的余长春今天曾以零比二输给四川队的马金豹。北京一队郭仲恭曾以零比二和一比二分别败给上海二队姚振绪和刘恒恕。
    在女子团体赛第二组中，引人注目的是去年全国第十一名、由仇宝琴、于秀萍组成的山西队，以三比零赢了第六名、由李莉、刘雅琴、黎秀琳组成的北京一队。这两名山西选手都是横握球拍，一个是能削能攻，一个是全攻型，在比赛中大部分时间都掌握了主动。女子第二组的其他两场比赛结果是：去年全国亚军四川队和第三名广东一队分别以三比一和三比零胜了上海二队。
    女子第一组也进行了三场比赛，去年全国冠军上海一队以三比零胜第八名湖北队，湖北队以三比二胜第四名山东一队，第九名辽宁一队以三比零胜北京二队。
    参加争夺男、女第十名以后名次的各队，在比赛中也是鼓足干劲，力争上游，出现了好几场难分难解的场面。
