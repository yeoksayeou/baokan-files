    Chairman Mao Quotations Plaque
    Hainan Chengmai County　Zhang Dahan
    Chairman Mao Quotations Plaque,
    Hung up everywhere,
    Methods come from here,
    Enthusiasm comes from here.
    Seeing the quotations when going to work,
    Revolutionary passion fills the chest;
    Seeing the quotations when finishing work,
    All fatigue flies to the sky;
    Seeing the quotations in struggle,
    Standing firm in the wind and waves;
    Seeing the quotations when standing guard,
    Eyes are bright and free of dust.
    Chairman Mao Quotations Plaque,
    Hung up everywhere.
    Spring breeze starts from here,
    Sweet dew comes from here.
    Blowing the red flag as beautiful as a painting,
    Blowing the mountains and rivers shining brightly,
    Turning soil into gold, trees into forests,
    Fragrance spreads in all seasons, flowers bloom beyond the Great Wall...
    Socialist spring is ever young,
    Everyone wears red flowers on their chest,
    Able to hold up the sky if it falls,
    A new generation comes to take over.
    Chairman Mao Quotations Plaque,
    Hung up everywhere,
    Mountains cheer,
    Seas applaud,
    Demons and monsters are frightened,
    Evil spirits are dumbfounded,
    Evil winds collapse,
    Difficulties get out of the way!
    The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought,
    Illuminates a new era of people's liberation!
    The revolutionary storm arises from the plaque,
    The day of victory comes from the plaque.

    主席语录牌
    海南澄迈县　张大汉
    主席语录牌，
    到处挂起来，
    办法从这出，
    干劲从这来。
    出工见语录，
    革命豪情满胸怀；
    收工见语录，
    一身疲劳飞天外；
    斗争见语录，
    风里浪里脚不歪；
    放哨见语录，
    眼睛雪亮无尘埃。
    主席语录牌，
    到处挂起来。
    春风从这起，
    甘露从这来。
    吹得红旗美如画，
    吹得山水放光采，
    土变金，树成林，
    香飘四季，花开塞外……
    社会主义春不老，
    人人胸前红花开，
    天塌下来擎得住，
    一代新人接班来。
    主席语录牌，
    到处挂起来，
    山欢呼，
    海喝采，
    牛鬼惊，
    蛇神呆，
    妖风溃退，
    困难滚开！
    毛泽东思想的光辉，
    照亮人民解放的新时代！
    革命风暴牌中起，
    胜利之日牌中来。
