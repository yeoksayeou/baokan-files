    Birds of a Feather Flock Together
    After usurping state power, the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique has intensified its collusion with the Japanese reactionaries. Japanese Prime Minister Sato publicly announced that the Japanese government will henceforth "actively cooperate in all aspects" with the Indonesian government. According to Japanese newspapers, the Sato government has proposed to relevant countries the establishment of a "Tokyo Club" to "aid" Indonesia, is actively working for Indonesia's return to the United Nations, and will also come forward to "mediate" the "dispute" between Indonesia and "Malaysia."
    The Japanese reactionaries and the Indonesian right-wing forces have been colluding for a long time. There are numerous connections between them. Some leading figures of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party have been colluding with the Indonesian Army's right-wing through the "Far East Oil Company." Some of the right-wing generals and reactionary politicians who currently occupy important military and political positions in the Indonesian government were trained by former Japanese soldiers, and some have been old-line pro-Japanese elements since the Pacific War. The main orchestrator of this Indonesian counter-revolutionary military coup was the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency; in addition, Japanese militarists also played a role. This has long been no secret.
    After the Indonesian right-wing military clique launched the coup, the Japanese reactionaries openly and actively intervened in the Indonesian situation. They have repeatedly provided "emergency" assistance to the Indonesian right-wing military clique. It is very clear that in addition to directly coming forward themselves, U.S. imperialism also needs to vigorously support the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces through Japanese militarists. The Sato government is acting as an agent of U.S. imperialism, boosting and transfusing blood to the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces from all aspects such as politics, economy, and diplomacy.
    Of course, the Japanese reactionaries also harbor expansionist ambitions towards Indonesia. Japanese monopoly capital has always coveted Indonesia's rich human and material resources and has never given up the intention of returning to Indonesia. Sato said that on the issue of "aid" to Indonesia, the Japanese government will "coordinate" with the United States. This shows that while acting as an agent of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries are trying to infiltrate their own colonial forces into Indonesia.
    Birds of a feather flock together, and people are classified by their kind. It is not surprising that the Indonesian right-wing military clique colludes with U.S. imperialism, colludes with Japanese militarists, and colludes with all the demons and monsters in the world.

    物以类聚
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团在篡夺了国家政权以后，加紧同日本反动派勾结。日本首相佐藤公开宣布，日本政府今后将同印度尼西亚政府“在一切方面积极合作”。据日本报纸报道，佐藤政府已向有关国家提议成立“援助”印度尼西亚的“东京俱乐部”，正在为印度尼西亚回到联合国积极活动，并且要出面“调停”印度尼西亚同“马来西亚”的“纠纷”。
    日本反动派同印度尼西亚右派势力勾勾搭搭，由来已久。他们之间有着千丝万缕的联系。日本自由民主党的一些头面人物过去一直通过“远东石油公司”同印度尼西亚陆军右派相勾结。目前窃踞印度尼西亚政府军政要职的右派将领头目和反动政客，有的是日本旧军人一手训练出来的，有的从太平洋战争时期起就是老牌的亲日派。策划这次印度尼西亚反革命军事政变的，主要是美国中央情报局，此外，日本军国主义者也插了一手。这早已不是什么秘密。
    在印度尼西亚右派军人集团发动政变以后，日本反动派就公开地、积极地插手印度尼西亚局势。他们一再向印度尼西亚右派军人集团提供“紧急”援助。很显然，美帝国主义除了自己直接出面之外，还需要通过日本军国主义者来大力扶植印度尼西亚右派反动势力。佐藤政府是在充当美帝国主义的代理人，从政治、经济、外交等各方面为印度尼西亚右派反动势力打气和输血。
    当然，日本反动派对于印度尼西亚也是怀着扩张主义野心的。日本垄断资本，从来就对印度尼西亚丰富的人力和物质资源垂涎欲滴，从来就没有放弃过重返印度尼西亚的意图。佐藤说，在“援助”印度尼西亚问题上，日本政府将和美国“协调”一致。这就表明，日本反动派在充当美帝国主义代理人的同时，力图把自己的殖民势力渗入印度尼西亚。
    物以类聚，人以群分。印度尼西亚右派军人集团同美帝国主义勾结，同日本军国主义者勾结，同世界上一切牛鬼蛇神勾结，这是毫不奇怪的。
