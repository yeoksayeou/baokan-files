    Don't Even Think About Shaking Our Ironclad State
    A Soldier of a Certain PLA Unit, Chen Daifu
    "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are big poisonous weeds that attack the Party and socialism.
    "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" promotes that "honest officials" in feudal society dared to "scold" and calls on readers to learn from those who dared to "scold" the emperor. It claims that with such ambition, one would fear nothing. Officials in feudal society were emperors' big and small slaves. They could not possibly scold the emperor; on the contrary, they loved the emperor very much. In fact, Hai Rui didn't scold the emperor, but Comrade Wu Han insisted that he did. Comrade Wu Han fabricated and promoted this kind of "scolding" to cheerlead for right-leaning opportunists to scold the Party, scold socialism, and scold the Three Red Banners.
    When our country's economic construction encountered temporary difficulties, right-leaning opportunists raised their heads, all the monsters and demons came out one after another, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries clamored for "counter-attack," and the international imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of various countries also actively opposed China. At this time, Comrade Wu Han wrote extensively about Hai Rui and advocated being an "opposition." What does this illustrate? It can only illustrate that as the socialist revolution deepens, these bourgeois intellectuals become increasingly dissatisfied, and they finally stand together with right-leaning opportunists and all monsters and demons to oppose the Party, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose socialism.
    The right-leaning opportunists had just been "dismissed from office," and Comrade Wu Han immediately wrote to praise Hai Rui who was "dismissed from office." Praising Hai Rui's indomitable spirit, not being intimidated by failure, and the strong will to try again after failure. Is this not calling on the right-leaning opportunists to "try again after failure"?
    I am a soldier of the People's Liberation Army. When the Indian reactionaries launched an aggression against our country, we went to the front. While we were fighting hard on the battlefield, severely打击打 the Indian aggressors, driving away and eliminating the enemy, and defending the socialist state, Comrade Wu Han was writing articles and plays in the rear that opposed socialism. Isn't this digging at the foundation of socialism? We, the People's Liberation Army, are soldiers of the Party, people's soldiers armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We must defend the socialist state. We feel very angry about Comrade Wu Han writing things like "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."
    After the criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was published in the newspaper, Comrade Wu Han hurriedly wrote a "self-criticism." This "self-criticism" did not dig up the ideological roots at all, but only superficially dealt with it. Saying that at that time, the "purpose was unclear," "for the sake of the ancient for the ancient," "writing a play for the sake of writing a play," was "confused." This is nonsense, trying to muddle through. All this is a waste of effort.
    We know that all people's actions are dictated by thoughts, and there can be no action without thought activity. Wu Han studied Hai Rui, wrote articles, and "broke through the door" to write plays, so enthusiastic and so energetic, but said that there was no purpose and was written in a confused state. Even children would not believe this. The debt cannot be denied, and we will never relax the criticism of these poisonous weeds.

    休想撼动我们的铁打江山

    《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》是向党、向社会主义进攻的大毒草。
    《海瑞骂皇帝》宣扬封建社会的“清官”敢“骂”，号召读者向敢“骂”皇帝的人学习。说什么有这种志气，什么都不怕。封建社会的官，是皇帝封的大大小小的奴才。他们根本不可能骂皇帝，相反的，却是很爱皇帝的。事实上海瑞也没有骂皇帝，吴晗同志却硬说他骂了。吴晗同志捏造并鼓吹这种“骂”，是给右倾机会主义分子骂党、骂社会主义、骂三面红旗当啦啦队。
    在我国经济建设遇到暂时困难的时候，右倾机会主义者抬头，一切牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼，蒋介石反动派叫嚣“反攻”，国际上帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派也积极反华。吴晗同志在这时大写海瑞，提倡当“反对派”。这说明什么问题呢？它只能说明由于社会主义革命越来越深入，这些资产阶级知识分子也就越来越不满，他们终于跟右倾机会主义分子，跟一切牛鬼蛇神站在一起反对党、反对毛泽东思想、反对社会主义。
    右倾机会主义分子刚被“罢官”，吴晗同志又马上写歌颂被“罢官”的海瑞。歌颂海瑞不屈服，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志。号召向海瑞学习。这不正是要右倾机会主义分子“失败了再干”吗？
    我是一个人民解放军战士。当印度反动派发动对我国的侵略时，我们开赴前线。我们在战场上拼死拼活，狠狠打击印度侵略者，赶走和消灭敌人，保卫社会主义江山的时候，吴晗同志却在后方写反对社会主义的文章和戏，这不是在挖社会主义墙脚吗？我们解放军是党的战士，是毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士，我们要保卫社会主义江山。对吴晗同志写《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》这样的东西感到十分气愤。
    报纸上对《海瑞罢官》提出批判以后，吴晗同志急急忙忙写了“自我批评”。这个“自我批评”根本没有从思想根源挖起，只是轻描淡写、浮在上面对付一下。说什么当时“目的性不明确”，“为古而古”，“为写戏而写戏”，是“糊涂了”。这是鬼话，想蒙混过关。这一切都是白费心机。
    我们知道，人们的一切行动是由思想支配的，没有思想活动就不可能有行动。吴晗研究海瑞，写文章，“破门而出”写戏，那么热心，那么卖力，却说没有目的性，是糊里糊涂写的。这话连小孩子也不会相信。账是赖不了的，我们决不会放松对这些毒草的批判。
