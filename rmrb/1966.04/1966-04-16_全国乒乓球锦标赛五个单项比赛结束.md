    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 15th – Beijing player Zhuang Zedong and Shanxi player Qiu Baoqin won the men's singles and women's singles championships respectively in the 1966 National Table Tennis Championships tonight. In the finals, they defeated Shanghai player Li Furong and Guangdong player Liang Lizhen with the same score of 3-2. Li Furong and Liang Lizhen won the men's and women's singles runner-up, respectively. This is the third time that Zhuang Zedong, 24, has won the national men's singles championship since 1964. Qiu Baoqin, a 21-year-old chopper, won the national women's singles championship for the first time.
    Tonight, Zhuang Zedong also teamed up with Li Jingguang, 19, from Hebei, to win the men's doubles final, defeating Li Furong and Wang Jiasheng with a score of 3-1. Li Furong and Wang Jiasheng from Guizhou won the runner-up.
    The result of the women's doubles final was: Li Henan and Li Li from Beijing defeated Di Qianghua and Liu Yaqin from Jiangsu with a score of 3-0 to win the championship. Di Qianghua and Liu Yaqin won the runner-up.
    In the mixed doubles final, Wang Jiasheng and Li Henan from Shanghai teamed up to defeat Zhuang Zedong and Liang Lizhen with a score of 3-1 to win the championship. Zhuang Zedong and Liang Lizhen won the runner-up.
    These five finals, held at the Jiangwan Stadium in Shanghai, were all exciting and aroused enthusiastic applause and praise from the audience.
    The men's singles final was a repeat of the world championship battle. World champion Zhuang Zedong attacked on both sides, while world runner-up Li Furong pushed from the left and attacked from the right. During the match, they often engaged in fierce rallies, fully embodying the unique style of Chinese straight-grip players: "fast, accurate, ruthless, and versatile." The audience's applause and cheers came one after another.
    This decisive battle of speed, strength, and will, was full of ups and downs. Li Furong won the first game 21-19; Zhuang Zedong then won the next two games 21-15 and 21-13, taking a 2-1 lead. In the fourth game, Li Furong tenaciously counterattacked from a disadvantageous position of 3-7 and 11-14, tying the score at 14-14. Afterwards, Zhuang Zedong made consecutive smash errors, losing 15-21 and allowing Li Furong to tie the score at 2-2. In the fifth game of the final, Li Furong took a 5-1 lead, but Zhuang Zedong quickly tied the score at 5-5; Li Furong then took a 10-6 lead, and Zhuang Zedong quickly tied the score at 10-10. Afterwards, Zhuang Zedong took the initiative to attack, and his smashes became more and more accurate, finally winning the final victory with 21-16.
    Since the beginning of the men's singles competition, Zhuang Zedong has also defeated Liang Geliang from Guangxi, Jiang Guanglu from Anhui, Liu Hengshu, Yu Yize and Zhang Xielin from Shanghai, showing his excellent skills.
    The women's singles championship battle was a major battle of "attack" against "defense," which was in stark contrast to the men's singles battle. Qiu Baoqin, who won the women's singles championship at the 1963 Hangzhou Table Tennis Invitational Tournament, overcame a 1-2 deficit, demonstrating the style of Chinese choppers: "stable defense, low chops, good spin variation, and capable of counterattacking on both sides." She won two consecutive games to defeat Liang Lizhen.
    In the fourth game, Liang Lizhen once took a commanding lead of 17-11. At this time, Qiu Baoqin became more and more stable in her chops, controlling the spin and landing point very well, causing Liang Lizhen to make continuous smash errors. Finally, she won this crucial game with a score of 21-19 amidst the loud applause of the audience. After entering the fierce battle of the fifth game, Qiu Baoqin completely controlled the situation. She suddenly flicked her wrist to score points repeatedly, winning the final victory with 21-11. The scores of the first three games were 15-21, 21-15 and 12-21.
    Since the beginning of the women's singles competition, Qiu Baoqin has also eliminated Liu Lunju from Hunan, Zhang Qingzhen from Yunnan, Wang Lianfang from Shanghai, last year's national champion Lin Huiqing, and last year's national runner-up Li Henan.
    The three doubles finals all featured exciting scenes of four players taking turns smashing the ball more than a dozen times to score a point. Zhuang Zedong and Wang Jiasheng both knocked down the barriers while saving difficult balls, demonstrating a fighting style of striving for every ball.
    This morning, in the men's doubles quarter-finals and semi-finals, Zhuang Zedong and Li Jingguang eliminated Diao Wenyuan and He Zubin from Anhui, and Zhou Lansun and Yu Changchun from Shanxi, with scores of 3-2 and 3-1 respectively. In the final, they defeated Li Furong and Wang Jiasheng with scores of 17-21, 21-9, 21-17, and 22-20.
    This morning, in the women's doubles quarter-finals and semi-finals, Li Henan and Li Li eliminated Qiu Baoqin and Lin Ximeng from Fujian, and Liang Lizhen and Lin Xiuying from Shanghai, with scores of 3-1 and 3-2 respectively, entering the final. In the final, they defeated Di Qianghua and Liu Yaqin with scores of 21-15, 21-15, and 21-18.
    In the mixed doubles semi-final held this morning, Wang Jiasheng and Li Henan eliminated Li Deyang from Liaoning and Qiu Baoqin from Shanxi with a score of 3-2. In the final, their score over Zhuang Zedong and Liang Lizhen was: 21-19, 22-20, 19-21, 21-18.

    全国乒乓球锦标赛五个单项比赛结束
    男子单打冠军：庄则栋　
    女子单打冠军：仇宝琴
    男子双打冠军：庄则栋和李景光
    女子双打冠军：李赫男和李莉
    混合双打冠军：王家声和李赫男
    据新华社上海十五日电  北京选手庄则栋和山西选手仇宝琴，今晚分别获得了一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛的男子单打冠军和女子单打冠军。他们在决赛中以三比二的同样比数，分别战胜了上海选手李富荣和广东选手梁丽珍。李富荣和梁丽珍分别取得男、女单打亚军。这是二十四岁的庄则栋自一九六四年以来第三次获得男子单打的全国冠军。二十一岁的削球手仇宝琴是第一次获得女子单打的全国冠军。
    庄则栋今晚还在男子双打决赛中，同河北十九岁的李景光合作，以三比一赢了李富荣和王家声，获得冠军。李富荣和贵州的王家声获得亚军。
    女子双打决赛的结果是：李赫男和北京的李莉以三比○战胜了江苏的狄蔷华和北京的刘雅琴，获得冠军。狄蔷华和刘雅琴获得亚军。
    在混合双打决赛中，王家声和上海的李赫男合作以三比一战胜了庄则栋和梁丽珍，获得冠军。庄则栋和梁丽珍获得亚军。
    在上海江湾体育馆举行的这五项决赛，场场精彩，激起了观众的热烈掌声和赞扬。
    男子单打决赛是一场世界冠军争夺战的重演。世界冠军庄则栋两面起板，世界亚军李富荣左推右攻，在比赛过程中经常展开暴风骤雨般的猛烈对攻，充分体现出我国直拍选手“快、狠、准、多变”的独特风格，观众的掌声和喝采声一阵接着一阵。
    这场比速度、比力量、比意志的决战，波涛起伏，李富荣以二十一比十九先胜一局；庄则栋接着以二十一比十五、二十一比十三连扳两局，反而以二比一领先。在第四局中，李富荣在三比七、十一比十四的不利情况下，顽强反攻，追成十四平。以后，庄则栋连续抽杀失误，反以十五比二十一失利，被李富荣扳成二平。决赛的第五局，李富荣先以五比一领先，但很快就被庄则栋扳成五平；李富荣再以十比六领先，庄则栋又很快扳成十平。之后，庄则栋抢先起板，越扣越准，终于以二十一比十六赢得了最后胜利。
    庄则栋在从男子单打开始以来，还曾经先后战胜了广西的梁戈亮、安徽的蒋光骝、上海的刘恒恕、于贻泽和张燮林，显示了他的过硬本领。
    女子单打冠军争夺战是一场“攻”对“守”的大战，这恰好同男子单打争夺战形成鲜明的对照。曾经获得一九六三年杭州乒乓球邀请赛女子单打冠军的仇宝琴，是在一比二落后的不利情况下，发挥我国削球手“守得稳，削得低，旋转变化好，两面能反攻”的风格，连赢两局战胜梁丽珍的。
    在第四局中，梁丽珍一度以十七比十一遥遥领先。这时，仇宝琴却越削越稳，旋转和落点都控制得很好，造成梁丽珍的扣球不断失误，最后终于在全场观众的响亮掌声中以二十一比十九赢了这关键的一局。进入第五局激战后，仇宝琴完全控制了局势，她突然抖腕闪击连连得分，以二十一比十一获最后胜利。这场比赛的前三局比分是十五比二十一、二十一比十五和十二比二十一。
    仇宝琴自女子单打比赛开始以来，还曾经先后淘汰了湖南的刘伦菊、云南的张庆珍、上海的王莲芳和去年全国冠军林慧卿和去年全国亚军李赫男。
    三项双打决赛，都出现了四名选手轮番扣杀十多板才得一分的精彩场面。庄则栋、王家声在抢救险球时，都曾经撞倒挡板，表现了每球必争的战斗风格。
    庄则栋、李景光今天上午在男子双打复赛和半决赛中，曾经分别以三比二和三比一淘汰了安徽的刁文元和湖北的何祖斌、山西的周兰荪和上海的余长春。在决赛中，他们战胜李富荣和王家声的比数是：十七比二十一、二十一比九、二十一比十七、二十二比二十。
    李赫男和李莉今天上午在女子双打复赛和半决赛中，先后以三比一和三比二淘汰了仇宝琴和福建的林希孟、梁丽珍和上海的林秀英，进入决赛。决赛中，她们以二十一比十五、二十一比十五和二十一比十八战胜了狄蔷华和刘雅琴。
    王家声和李赫男在今天上午举行的混合双打半决赛中，曾经以三比二淘汰了辽宁的李德洋和山西的仇宝琴。他们在决赛中胜庄则栋和梁丽珍的比分是：二十一比十九、二十二比二十、十九比二十一、二十一比十八。
