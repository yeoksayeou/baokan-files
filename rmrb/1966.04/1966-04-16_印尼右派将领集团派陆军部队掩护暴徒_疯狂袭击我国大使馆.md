    Indonesian Right-Wing Generals Group Sends Army Troops to Cover Thugs
    Frantically Attacks Our Embassy
    Beating our diplomatic officials, shooting our staff, wantonly destroying and setting fire to the embassy's equipment and documents, and looting a large amount of property. Our Chargé d'affaires ad interim lodged the strongest protest with Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik and the Indonesian government on the spot.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 15th - News: The Indonesian right-wing generals group organized more than 1,000 thugs today and dispatched army armed personnel and armored vehicles to cooperate in a barbaric attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia in the morning, beating Chinese diplomatic officials and shooting and wounding embassy staff member Zhao Xiaoshou. This robber-like behavior of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, which openly tramples on the basic norms of international law and the inviolability of diplomatic personnel, nakedly exposes its fascist face to the world.
    According to preliminary information received so far, at 10:50 a.m. on the 15th, more than 1,000 thugs organized by the Indonesian right-wing military regime, under the cover of army troops and armored vehicles, used armored vehicles and trucks to smash open the gate of the Chinese Embassy and rushed into the courtyard, shouting anti-China slogans, and broke into the embassy's hall and other places to carry out wanton destruction. They broke doors and windows, smashed cars, and set fire to the embassy's equipment, furniture, and incoming and outgoing official documents, and looted three cars and a large amount of property. Army troops joined the thugs in carrying out destruction and openly fired shots continuously, seriously injuring our staff member Zhao Xiaoshou. They also beat five diplomatic officials, including Lu Zibo, First Secretary of the Chinese Embassy, and Shi Xinren, Deputy Military Attaché. This group of thugs openly insulted the national flag of the People's Republic of China, tore down our national flag hanging on the flagpole in the courtyard, and hoisted the Indonesian flag. Among the thugs who committed atrocities in the Chinese Embassy, there were also some Chiang gang secret agents.
    Indonesian armed forces personnel and thugs committed atrocities in the Chinese Embassy for as long as three hours. When they were about to leave, they also shouted slogans such as "Long live the United States" and "We have completed the task of destroying the Chinese Embassy that Uncle Suharto told us to do." When Adam Malik, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the cabinet ruled by the Indonesian right-wing generals group, came to the Chinese Embassy, some thugs and military police were still there.
    Yao Dengshan, Chargé d'affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy, lodged the strongest protest with Malik and the Indonesian government against the barbaric atrocities of the Indonesian military police and thugs attacking the Chinese Embassy. The Chinese diplomatic officials present also protested to him in unison and showed him the blood-stained clothes of Zhao Xiaoshou, who had been beaten. Malik had no words to answer and left in embarrassment.
    Since the beginning of October last year, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have dispatched army troops or covered thugs to carry out sixteen barbaric attacks on the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, the Commercial Counselor's Office of the Embassy, the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta, the Chinese Consulates in Medan, Banjarmasin, and Makassar, and the Jakarta branch of the Xinhua News Agency, and the atrocities have become increasingly rampant and crazy. Recently, after openly declaring allegiance to the United States, they openly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang secret agent elements who had long been spurned by the Chinese people to attack China's diplomatic and consular institutions in Indonesia, which fully exposed their shameful face as anti-China pawns of U.S. imperialism and its accomplices.

    印尼右派将领集团派陆军部队掩护暴徒
    疯狂袭击我国大使馆
    殴伤我外交官员，枪伤我工作人员，恣意破坏并纵火焚烧使馆的设备和文件，抢走大量财物。我临时代办当场向印尼外长马利克和印尼政府提出最强烈抗议。
    新华社十五日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团今天组织暴徒一千多人，并出动陆军武装人员和装甲车配合，在上午野蛮袭击中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆，打伤中国外交官员，开枪打伤使馆工作人员赵小寿。印度尼西亚右派军人政权这种公然践踏国际法起码准则和外交人员不受侵犯的特权的强盗行为，在全世界面前赤裸裸地暴露了它的法西斯面目。
    根据目前收到的初步消息，十五日上午十时五十分，印度尼西亚右派军人政权组织的暴徒千余人，在陆军部队和装甲车的掩护下，用装甲车、卡车撞开中国大使馆的大门，冲入院内，狂喊反华口号，闯入使馆的大厅等处恣意进行破坏。他们打破门窗，砸毁汽车，并且纵火焚烧使馆的设备、家具和来往官方文件，抢走三辆汽车和大量财物。陆军部队同暴徒们一起进行破坏，并公然连续开枪射击，重伤我工作人员赵小寿。他们还殴伤中国大使馆的一等秘书吕子波、副武官时心仁等外交官员五人。这伙暴徒公然侮辱中华人民共和国国旗，扯下了院内旗杆上悬挂的我国国旗，挂上了印度尼西亚的国旗。在中国大使馆行凶的暴徒中，还有一些蒋帮特务分子。
    印度尼西亚武装部队人员和暴徒在中国大使馆行凶达三小时之久。他们在临走时还大喊“美国万岁”、“我们完成了苏哈托伯伯叫我们捣毁中国大使馆的任务”等口号。在印度尼西亚右派将领集团统治的内阁外交部长阿达姆·马利克来到中国大使馆的时候，一些暴徒和军警还留在那里。
    中国大使馆临时代办姚登山就印度尼西亚军警和暴徒袭击中国大使馆的野蛮暴行，向马利克和印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，在场的中国外交官员也齐声向他抗议，并且出示了被打伤的赵小寿的血衣。马利克无词可对，狼狈退走。
    自去年十月初以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力出动陆军部队或是由他们掩护暴徒，对中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆、大使馆商务参赞处，中国驻雅加达总领事馆，中国驻棉兰、马辰、望加锡的领事馆，新华通讯社雅加达分社，已先后进行了十六次野蛮袭击，暴行愈演愈疯狂。最近，他们在公开宣布投靠美国之后，又公然勾结早已被中国人民唾弃的蒋介石匪帮特务分子，对中国驻印度尼西亚的外交和领事机构进行袭击，这充分暴露了他们的充当美帝国主义及其帮凶的反华走卒的可耻面目。
