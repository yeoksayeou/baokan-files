    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 9th) A report from Tokyo: Approximately one thousand representatives from over a hundred political parties and mass organizations in Japan held a rally in Tokyo on the evening of the 9th, protesting the Sato government's refusal to allow entry to a delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. The meeting passed a resolution to launch a struggle until the Chinese delegation arrives in Japan.
    The sponsoring political parties and organizations included the Japan Socialist Party, the Japan Communist Party, the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo), the Japan-China Friendship Association, the Japan Peace Committee, and organizations from the fields of workers, peasants, youth, women, culture, economics, sports, and religion.
    Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Tomomi Narita, stated in his speech at the rally: "The Sato government's action runs counter to the Japanese people's desire for peace in Asia and is therefore intolerable."
    Narita condemned the Sato government's absurd remarks that the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan would "harm" Japan's national interests. He said that, in reality, "the Sato government is participating in US imperialism's policy of 'containing China' and serving the interests of the United States."
    He expressed his determination to fight with all his strength until the Chinese delegation enters Japan.
    Kasuga Shoichi, member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, said in his speech: "The Sato government's action is another example of its hostility towards China and is an open challenge to the Japanese people."
    Kasuga Shoichi said: "The deeper US imperialism sinks into its difficulties in Asia, the more actively the Sato government serves the US aggression in Southeast Asia."
    Leaders of various organizations attending the conference all condemned the Sato government's reactionary measures, which subserviently follow US imperialism's policy of "containing China." Among them were Tomitaro Kaneda, Vice-Chairman of Sohyo, Kenzo Nakajima, Director of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, as well as famous writers, actors, dancers, and famous professional Go players. Yoshikatsu Takeiri, Chairman of the Komeito, sent a telegram to the meeting, expressing his hope for further struggle to realize the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan. The conference unanimously passed a resolution demanding that the Sato government rescind its decision to refuse the Chinese delegation's visit to Japan and guaranteeing to launch a vigorous struggle to enable the Chinese delegation to visit Japan.

    日本百余政党团体代表集会抗议拒绝我代表团入境
    坚决向佐藤政府敌视中国行为展开斗争
    谴责佐藤政府积极为美帝国主义“遏制中国”政策效劳
    据新华社九日讯　东京消息：日本一百多个政党和群众团体的代表约一千人九日晚上在东京举行大会，抗议佐藤政府拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境。会上通过决议，决定展开斗争直到中国代表团来到日本为止。
    大会的发起政党和团体包括日本社会党、共产党、日本工会总评议会、日中友好协会、日本和平委员会以及工人、农民、青年、妇女、文化、经济、体育、宗教等方面的组织。
    社会党书记长成田知巳在集会上的讲话中指出：“佐藤政府的这种行动是同日本人民争取亚洲和平的愿望背道而驰的，因此是不能容忍的。”
    成田谴责佐藤政府诬蔑中国代表团到日本访问将“危害”日本的民族利益的荒谬言论。他说，实际上是，“佐藤政府参与美帝国主义‘遏制中国’的政策，为美国的利益效劳。”
    他表示决心全力进行斗争，直到中国代表团进入日本为止。
    日共中央政治局委员春日正一在讲话中说：“佐藤政府的这个行动是它敌视中国的又一事例，是对日本人民的公开挑战。”
    春日正一说：“美帝国主义在亚洲的困境中陷得越深，佐藤政府就越积极为美国侵略东南亚的行动效劳。”
    出席大会的各团体的领导人都在大会上谴责佐藤政府这个屈从美帝国主义“遏制中国”的政策而采取的反动措施。他们当中有“总评”副议长兼田富太郎，日本中国文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏以及著名作家、演员、舞蹈家和有名的职业围棋手等。公明党委员长土武寿在打给大会的电报中，表示希望进一步开展斗争，以实现中国代表团访日。大会一致通过决议，要求佐藤政府取消拒绝中国代表团访问日本的决定，并且保证为使中国代表团访问日本而展开有力的斗争。
