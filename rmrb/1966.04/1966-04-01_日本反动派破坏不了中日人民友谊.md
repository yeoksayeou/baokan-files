    The Sato Government Brazenly Announces Unreasonable Refusal of Entry to Our Delegation; Our Foreign Affairs Institute Condemns the Sato Government for Following the US Imperialists in Antagonizing China
    Xinhua News Agency, March 31st. The spokesman for the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs today issued a statement regarding the unreasonable refusal by the Japanese Sato government to allow a delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to visit Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Socialist Party, as follows:
    On March 29th, the Japanese Sato government brazenly announced its refusal to allow a delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to enter Japan. We cannot help but feel extreme indignation at the Sato government's reactionary measures to deliberately obstruct friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan.
    This unreasonable act by the Sato government to obstruct normal exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan completely violates the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people, once again exposing its reactionary face of following the United States and blatantly antagonizing China, demonstrating that it can only act according to Washington's dictates and cannot adopt even a hint of a "independent and autonomous" policy.
    Recently, the Sato government has more actively followed the aggressive and war policies of US imperialism, intensifying its hostility towards the Chinese people, the Vietnamese people, the Korean people, and the people of various Asian countries, and is pushing Japan onto an extremely dangerous path. The Sato government's retrograde practices will certainly meet with a bloody nose in the face of the awakened Japanese people and the people of various Asian countries, and will never end well.
    For more than ten years, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs has received many friends from various Japanese political parties and organizations, and has made positive contributions together with friends from all walks of life in Japan to promote Sino-Japanese friendship. We have issued four joint statements with the Japanese Socialist Party, which have been warmly supported by the peoples of China and Japan. Now, the visit of the delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Socialist Party is fully in line with the wishes of the peoples of China and Japan.
    Now, friends of the Japanese Socialist Party are, together with people from all walks of life in Japan, continuing to struggle to realize the visit of the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to Japan and to strengthen the development of friendly relations between the peoples of China and Japan. We express our admiration for this.
    The troublemaking of a handful of Japanese reactionaries cannot stop the tide of history. Although the Sato government is obstructing the visit of the delegation from the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to Japan, our friendly relations with friends from all walks of life in Japan cannot be broken up by any force. The fighting friendship that has been firmly established between the peoples of China and Japan cannot be destroyed by any force.

    日本反动派破坏不了中日人民友谊
    佐藤政府悍然宣布无理拒绝我国代表团入境我外交学会谴责佐藤政府追随美帝敌视中国
    新华社三十一日讯　中国人民外交学会发言人，今天就日本佐藤政府无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团应日本社会党的邀请访问日本一事，发表谈话如下：
    三月二十九日，日本佐藤政府悍然宣布了拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境。对于佐藤政府蓄意阻挠中日两国人民友好往来的反动措施，我们不能不感到极大的愤慨。
    佐藤政府这一阻挠中日两国人民正常往来的无理行为，完全违背了日本广大人民的愿望，再一次暴露了它追随美国、露骨地敌视中国的反动面目，说明了它只能仰承华盛顿的鼻息办事，不能采取半点“独立自主”的政策。
    最近，佐藤政府更加积极地追随美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，变本加厉地与中国人民、越南人民、朝鲜人民和亚洲各国人民为敌，正在把日本推向一条极其危险的道路上去。佐藤政府这种倒行逆施的作法，在觉醒了的日本人民和亚洲各国人民面前，定将碰得头破血流，决不会有好的下场。
    十多年来，中国人民外交学会多次接待过日本各政党、各团体的许多朋友，同日本各界朋友一道为促进中日友好作出了积极的贡献。我们同日本社会党发表了四次共同声明，受到中日两国人民的热烈支持。现在，中国人民外交学会代表团应日本社会党的邀请访问日本，是完全符合中日两国人民的愿望的。
    现在，日本社会党的朋友们正在和日本各界人民一道，继续为实现中国人民外交学会代表团的访日，为加强中日两国人民友好关系的发展而进行着斗争，我们对此表示钦佩。
    一小撮日本反动派的兴风作浪，决不能阻挡历史前进的潮流。尽管佐藤政府阻挠中国人民外交学会代表团访日，但是我们同日本各界朋友之间的友好关系，是任何力量也不能冲散的。中日两国人民之间已经牢固地建立起来的战斗友谊，是任何力量也破坏不了的。
