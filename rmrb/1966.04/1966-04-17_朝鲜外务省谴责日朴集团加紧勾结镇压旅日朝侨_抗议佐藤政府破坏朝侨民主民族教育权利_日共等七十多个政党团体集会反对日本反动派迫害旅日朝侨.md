    According to Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 16th: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 16th, strongly condemning the Japanese Sato government's plot to trample upon the democratic national education rights of Korean citizens residing in Japan by formulating the so-called "Amendment to the School Education Law."

    The statement said that since the signing of the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," the Japanese government has colluded even more closely with the Park Chung-hee clique, intensifying suppression of Korean citizens residing in Japan and trampling upon their democratic national rights. Currently, the Japanese Sato government is rushing to formulate the so-called "Amendment to the School Education Law" in order to, based on this "amendment," arbitrarily interfere with and control the schools of Korean citizens residing in Japan, and to close these schools at any time under unjust pretexts such as "harming Japan's interests and security" and "not meeting the recognized conditions," and attempting to impose "assimilation education" on the children of Korean citizens.

    The statement said that this conspiratorial activity of the Japanese government is part of the fascist suppression of democratic forces within Japan by Japanese militarist forces under the direction of U.S. imperialism, in order to realize overseas expansion.

    The statement expressed that the Korean people will absolutely not allow the Japanese government's illegal activities of undermining the democratic national education of Korean citizens residing in Japan and insulting their national dignity. The Korean government strongly demands that the Japanese government, in accordance with the principles of international law and international practices, respect the basic human rights of Korean citizens residing in Japan, immediately cease all forms of discrimination and persecution against them, and guarantee democratic national education.

    If the Japanese government continues to persecute and undermine the democratic national education of Korean citizens residing in Japan, then it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Tokyo news: The Japanese Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Japan-Korea Association, and seventy-one other democratic organizations held a meeting in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 12th, deciding to oppose the Sato government's attempt to pass a reactionary bill in the Diet to interfere with and undermine the national and democratic education implemented by Korean residents in Japan.

    Representatives of the Japanese Communist Party and the Socialist Party, as well as prominent scholars and cultural figures such as Yoshitaro Hirano and Kenzo Nakajima, spoke at the meeting. They all expressed their firm opposition to the Sato government's policy of persecution against the education of Korean residents in Japan.

    日共等七十多个政党团体集会反对日本反动派迫害旅日朝侨
    据新华社平壤十六日电  朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府外务省十六日发表声明，严厉谴责日本佐藤政府阴谋通过制订所谓“学校教育法修改案”，践踏旅日朝鲜公民的民主民族教育权利。
    声明说，“韩日条约”签订以后，日本政府同朴正熙集团更加加紧勾结，对旅日朝鲜公民加紧进行镇压，践踏他们的民主民族权利。现在，日本佐藤政府正在急于制订所谓“学校教育法修改案”，以便根据这项“修改案”，随心所欲地干涉和控制旅日朝鲜公民的学校，和以“损害了日本的利益和安全”、“不符合所认可的条件”等不正当的借口，随时封闭这些学校，并且企图把“同化教育”强加给朝鲜公民子女。
    声明说，日本政府的这种阴谋活动，是日本军国主义势力在美帝国主义的指使下，为了实现向海外扩张，在日本国内进行的对民主力量的法西斯镇压的一部分。
    声明表示，朝鲜人民绝对不会容许日本政府破坏旅日朝鲜公民的民主民族教育、侮辱他们的民族尊严的非法活动。朝鲜政府强硬要求日本政府根据国际法的各项准则和国际惯例，尊重旅日朝鲜公民的基本人权，立即停止对他们的各种歧视和迫害，保障民主民族教育。
    如果日本政府继续对旅日朝鲜公民的民主民族教育进行迫害和破坏，那么，它就必须为由此而产生的一切后果承担全部责任。
    据新华社十三日讯　东京消息：日本共产党、社会党、日朝协会和其他七十一个民主组织十二日下午在东京举行会议，决定反对佐藤政府企图在国会通过一项反动法案来干涉和破坏旅日朝侨实行的民族、民主教育。
    日本共产党和社会党的代表以及平野义太郎、中岛健藏等著名学者和文化界人士，在会上讲了话。他们都表示坚决反对佐藤政府对旅日朝侨的教育所采取的迫害政策。
