    That Kind of "Dare"?
              Zhang Jincheng
    Comrade Wu Han said: "The history of the development of human society is the history of those who dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to act." "Writing plays, as I see it, also belongs to the 'dare' category." Different classes have different understandings of "daring to act." The proletariat understands "dare" as daring to make revolution, daring to win, daring to criticize all feudalist and bourgeois decadent ideas in history, and daring to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought to create a brand-new history. But to which class and which "category" does Comrade Wu Han's understanding of "dare" belong? He answered with his own words and deeds: it belongs to the anti-Party and anti-socialist bourgeois "category."
    When right opportunists attacked the Party, didn't he dare to stand up and cheer them on, repeatedly shouting "Scold, scold, scold," "Scold well, scold thoroughly!"? When the Party repelled the attack of the right opportunists and removed them from their positions, didn't he dare to plead for these people, scolding the Party for harming "loyal and good people"? Didn't he dare to encourage these people, telling them not to be discouraged, to try again after failing, and to snatch back their "official hats"? When we use Mao Zedong Thought to re-study history, restore the original face of history distorted by successive ruling classes, and regard the people as the masters of history, didn't Comrade Wu Han dare to step forward and loudly proclaim "we must resolutely oppose" this, otherwise history would "almost become a pitch-black mess"? When the socialist revolution delved deeply into the ideological sphere to thoroughly break with feudalism and the bourgeoisie, didn't Comrade Wu Han dare to write articles again and again, vigorously advocating inheriting feudal morality and bourgeois morality, and wanting to "apply them to today" and "make them a component of socialist and communist morality"? When he felt that the influence of these "theories" among the masses was not large enough, didn't Comrade Wu Han, as a historian, dare to "break out of his door" and revise his work seven times, writing his *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*? ... Comrade Wu Han, like all right opportunists, attempts to use this spirit of "daring to act" to restore their lost bourgeois "heaven" and create an anti-Party and anti-socialist history!
    His written *Self-Criticism Regarding 'Hai Rui Dismissed from Office'*, at first glance, seems to lack "courage": he doesn't dare to touch the substance of the problem, doesn't dare to admit the series of erroneous ideas that have been fully reflected in the play. But as long as we analyze it carefully, we will find that this "not daring" is just an outer garment, it is a new manifestation of Comrade Wu Han's spirit of "daring to act." He uses "not daring" to admit being anti-Party and anti-socialist as a cover, trying to defend himself in every possible way, retreating in order to advance, and posing new challenges to us. Isn't this "courage" to persist in error and reject revolution also "belonging to the 'dare' category"? This "courage," to put it bluntly, is the stubbornness of feudalist and bourgeois thought, the stubbornness of being anti-Party and anti-socialist.

    那一“流”的“敢”？
              张金城
    吴晗同志说：“一部人类社会的发展史，就是那些敢想、敢说、敢做的人们的历史。”“我写剧本，看来也属于‘敢’的一流。”不同的阶级对“敢作敢为”有不同的理解。无产阶级理解的“敢”，是敢于革命、敢于胜利，敢于批判历史上一切封建主义、资产阶级的陈腐思想，敢于高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗创造崭新的历史。而吴晗同志所理解的“敢”，究竟属于那个阶级、那一“流”呢？他以自己的言行作了回答：是反党反社会主义的资产阶级一“流”。
    当右倾机会主义向党进攻时，他不是敢于站出来擂鼓助威，一迭连声地叫嚷“骂，骂，骂”，
  “骂得好，骂得痛快”么！当党击退了右倾机会主义分子的进攻，撤了他们的职，他不是敢于为这些人请命，骂党残害“忠良”么！他不是敢于为这些人打气，要他们不要泄气，失败了再干，把“乌纱帽”再抢回来么！当我们用毛泽东思想重新研究历史，恢复被历代统治阶级所歪曲的历史本来面目，而把人民群众当成历史的主人时，吴晗同志不是敢于挺身而出，大声疾呼“必须坚决反对”，否则历史就“几乎成为漆黑一团”了吗！当社会主义革命深入到在意识形态领域内与封建主义、资产阶级彻底决裂的时候，吴晗同志不是敢于一而再、再而三地写文章，大力主张继承封建道德、资产阶级道德，并且要将它们“移用在今天”，“成为社会主义共产主义道德的组成部分”吗！当他感到这些“理论”在群众中的影响还不够大的时候，作为历史学家的吴晗同志，不是敢于“破门而出”、修改七次，写出了他的《海瑞罢官》么！……吴晗同志和一切右倾机会主义分子一样，就是企图用这种“敢作敢为”的精神来复辟他们那失去了的资产阶级的“天国”，创造一部反党反社会主义的历史！
    他写的《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》，乍一看，似乎很缺乏“勇气”：不敢触及问题的实质，不敢承认已经在剧本中充分反映出来了的一系列错误思想。但只要细一分析，就发现这种“不敢”只是一层外衣，它是吴晗同志“敢作敢为”精神的一种新的表现形式。他以“不敢”承认反党反社会主义为掩护，替自己百般辩解，以退为进，向我们提出了新的挑战。这种坚持错误、拒绝革命的“勇气”，不是的的确确也“属于敢的一流”么？这种“勇气”，说穿了，就是封建主义、资产阶级思想的顽固性，就是反党反社会主义的顽固性。
