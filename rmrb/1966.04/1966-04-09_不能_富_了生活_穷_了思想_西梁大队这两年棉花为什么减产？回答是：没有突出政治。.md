    Cannot Let Life Become "Rich" While Thoughts Become "Poor"
    Why Has Cotton Production Decreased in the West Liang Brigade These Past Two Years? The Answer Is: Failure to Highlight Politics.
    Some say that when production is backward, it is necessary to highlight politics; when production is advanced, highlighting politics is of little significance. Some say that in a socialist society, engaging in collective economic production is itself politics, so good production means good politics. Is this really the case? The actual answer from the West Liang Brigade in Yicheng County, Shanxi Province, says: No!
    Where is the Root of the Problem?
    The West Liang Production Brigade was a well-known high-yield cotton unit in our province more than a decade ago. However, in the last two years, compared with 1963, the unit yield per mu has decreased by 40% and 35% respectively.
    Why is this? Is it because of natural disasters? Natural disasters are one reason. There was flooding in 1964 and drought in 1965. However, the previous eight years were not all smooth sailing either!
    Is it because the material foundation is weak and the production conditions are poor? No. West Liang's material resources, animal power, and land are all relatively good in southern Shanxi.
    Is it because people's cotton planting technology is low and their experience is lacking? No. West Liang's cotton planting technology and experience have long been well-known throughout the province.
    Then, what exactly is it? The root of the problem lies in the failure to highlight politics. Wu Chun'an, the secretary of the brigade party branch, said: "In recent years, our souls have been somewhat disembodied, and our lives have been disconnected."
    Based on this understanding, the West Liang Brigade party branch started with the question of "Why has cotton production decreased?" and organized all cadres and party members to conduct a major discussion on the issue of highlighting politics.
    Why Can't We See Class Struggle?
    Before 1963, West Liang's production continuously increased, and the lives of the commune members constantly improved. This prosperous scene blurred the thinking of many people. They felt that they "couldn't find class struggle" in West Liang, and their eyes were only on cotton, livestock, technology, machines... However, what you don't see in your eyes doesn't mean it doesn't exist. In this major discussion, everyone studied Chairman Mao's theories on class struggle and, in light of the actual situation of their own team, realized that in teams with good production and in teams where the lives of commune members are relatively affluent, class struggle still exists without exception, and the struggle between the two roads is still quite fierce.
    The defeated class enemies are not reconciled to their failure. Some struggle openly, some struggle secretly, and some directly sabotage production; some use "soft" tactics, giving "gifts" to cadres, pretending to be solicitous, and trying to pull the cadres over to their side.
    Among the cadres and commune members, some only want to develop household sideline occupations and are not enthusiastic about developing the collective economy; some only care about the immediate good life, and always want to divide and distribute all the collective harvests; some cadres have serious departmentalism, and some are short-sighted and greedy.
    From this, everyone concluded: In recent years, we have "enriched our lives but impoverished our minds." The proletariat's politics in people's minds has become "poor," and the production of the collective economy will transform towards "poverty." This is precisely the fundamental reason for the substantial decrease in cotton production in the West Liang Brigade in the past two years.
    The Most Fundamental Thing is to Understand Politics
    Has there been a technical aspect to the reason for the decline in cotton production in the West Liang Brigade in the past two years? Yes. Although the cadres and commune members here are all highly skilled in cotton planting, because many people have "enriched their lives but impoverished their minds," they do not use their good technology. Therefore, the level of cultivation has decreased, and some plots have changed from intensive cultivation to extensive cultivation. The "four retentions and five beatings" of cotton were meticulously carried out in the past, on time and seriously, but in the past two years they have been careless and left out things. As a result, the pre-summer cotton bolls have generally decreased by 30%, and the boll shedding rate has generally increased by 10%. Speaking of learning technology, people here used to carry dry food on their backs and travel three or five hundred miles to learn from teachers and friends. In the past two years, people have been satisfied with being "full" and have been indifferent to learning technology. Female commune member Wu Aiping used to have the party branch focus on teaching her politics, talking about the relationship between planting cotton and making revolution. She stood tall and saw far, was not afraid of hardship, and became the best cotton technician among the women in the whole team. In the past two years, her family's life has become richer, the party branch no longer talks to her about politics, and she is no longer actively studying technology. Commune member Wang Lanying said in her self-criticism: "I used to manage cotton early in the morning and late at night, without feeling bitter or tired. Now that my belly is full, my body is warm, there is surplus grain at home, and there are savings in the bank, I am afraid of hardship in my thoughts, and I can't put my technology to use."
    From these facts, the party branch further clarified: To grow crops, you must understand all kinds of knowledge, you must understand politics, you must understand technology, but the most fundamental thing is to understand politics. Without understanding politics, even if the technology is good, it cannot be used effectively.
    Remember the Lessons of History
    Everyone reviewed the mutual aid and cooperation movement after the land reform. At that time, some people wanted to take the road of individual prosperity, and the party branch promptly organized everyone to criticize this idea, and firmly grasped the struggle between the two roads, which improved everyone's socialist consciousness, led everyone onto the socialist road, and greatly developed production.
    Everyone also reviewed the three years from 1959 to 1961, when they suffered continuous natural disasters. During this period, the party branch unswervingly carried out the education of carrying the proletarian revolution through to the end among the masses, and timely overcame the spontaneous capitalist tendencies that appeared in some people during the difficult period. Therefore, although the natural disasters were severe during these three years, the people's hearts were united, and the cotton yield per mu still remained at around 140 jin.
    In 1961 and 1962, socialist education was continuously carried out among the commune members, and in 1963, the historical record of cotton yield per mu was achieved, and grain, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations also greatly developed.
    In the past two years, neglecting politics has led to a decline in production!
    This series of recollections made everyone more deeply aware that class struggle is effective when grasped, and only by grasping revolution can production be promoted. When we forget class struggle and fail to grasp revolution, production will inevitably decline. Therefore, from now on, we must always listen to Chairman Mao's words, use politics to command production, use class struggle to command the struggle for production, put the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works on the party branch's agenda, put it in the first place in all work, and constantly improve the consciousness of all cadres and commune members to farm for the revolution. The richer the production, the more revolutionary we must be.

### 不能“富”了生活“穷”了思想  西梁大队这两年棉花为什么减产？回答是：没有突出政治。

    不能“富”了生活  “穷”了思想
    西梁大队这两年棉花为什么减产？回答是：没有突出政治。
    有人说，生产落后时，需要突出政治，生产先进了，突出政治便无多大意义；有人说：在社会主义社会，搞集体经济生产，这本身就是政治，所以，生产好就是政治好。事情果真是这样的吗？山西翼城县西梁大队的实际回答说：不是！
    病根子在哪里
    西梁生产大队，十几年以前就是我省出了名的棉花高产单位。可是，最近两年和一九六三年比较，单位亩产量却分别下降了百分之四十和百分之三十五。
    为什么呢？是因为天灾吗？天灾是一个原因。一九六四年涝，一九六五年旱。但是，前八年也不是年年风调雨顺啊！
    是物质基础薄弱，生产条件差吗？不是，西梁的物力、畜力、土地，在晋南来说，也都是比较好的。
    是人们种棉花的技术低、经验少吗？也不是。西梁的植棉技术和植棉经验，在全省是早已出了名的。
    那末，究竟是什么呢？病根子就出在没有突出政治上。大队党支部书记吴春安说：“我们这几年，就是有点灵魂出壳，生命离线。”
    基于这种认识，西梁大队党支部便从“棉花为啥减产”这个问题入手，组织全体干部和党员，对突出政治的问题，进行了大讨论。
    为什么看不到阶级斗争
    一九六三年以前，西梁的生产连续增长，社员生活不断提高，这种繁荣景象，使得许多人思想模糊起来。他们觉得在西梁“找不到阶级斗争了”，眼睛里只剩下了棉花、牲畜、技术、机器……可是，你眼睛里没有看到的东西，并不等于它不存在。在这次大讨论中，大家学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，对照本队的实际情况，才认识到在生产搞得好的队，在社员生活比较富裕的队，阶级斗争也毫不例外地存在着，两条道路的斗争依然相当激烈。
    被打倒的阶级敌人不甘心他们的失败，有的明争，有的暗斗，有的直接破坏生产；有的来“软”的一手，给干部赠送“礼物”，假献殷勤，企图把干部拉过去。
    在干部和社员中，有的人光想发展家庭副业，对发展集体经济不积极；有的人光顾眼前生活好，集体收获的东西，总想分净分光；有的干部本位主义严重，有的志短手长。
    由此，大家得出结论说：这几年我们是“富了生活，穷了思想。”人们的头脑里，无产阶级的政治“穷”了，集体经济的生产便会向“穷”转化。这正是西梁大队这两年来棉花大幅度减产的根本原因。
    最根本的是要懂政治
    西梁大队这两年来棉花减产，有没有技术措施上的原因呢？有。虽然这里干部社员种棉花的技术都比较高，但因不少人“富了生活、穷了思想”，有好技术也不往出使。因此，耕作水平降低了，一些地块由精耕细作变成了粗耕粗作了。棉花的“四留五打”，过去是一着不漏，适时认真，这两年却是马马虎虎，丢三拉四。结果，伏前桃普遍减少百分之三十，落蕾率却普遍增多百分之十。说起学习技术，这里的人们过去是背上干粮，三百里、五百里去拜师访友取经。这两年人们满足于“肚儿圆”，对学技术便冷淡了。女社员武爱平，过去党支部注重给她讲政治，讲种棉花和闹革命的关系，她就站得高看得远，不怕苦，不怕累，成为全队妇女中最好的棉花技术员。这两年她家生活过富了，党支部不再对她讲政治，她也不再积极钻研技术了。社员王兰英检讨说：“我过去管理棉花是早出晚归，不觉苦不觉累。现在肚里饱了，身上暖了，家里有存粮，银行有存款，思想上怕苦了，有技术也使不上劲了。”
    从这些事实中，党支部进一步明确了：种庄稼啥学问都得懂，要懂政治，要懂技术，但最根本的是要懂政治。不懂政治，技术再好，也不能很好发挥作用。
    记住历史的经验
    大家回顾了土地改革以后的互助合作运动。当时，有的人要走个人发家致富的道路，党支部及时组织大家批判了这种思想，狠抓两条道路的斗争，才提高了大家的社会主义觉悟，带领大家走上了社会主义道路，生产获得了很大发展。
    大家还回顾了从一九五九年到一九六一年连续遭受自然灾害的三年。这期间，党支部坚定不移地向群众进行了把无产阶级革命进行到底的教育，及时克服了一部分人在困难时期出现的自发资本主义倾向。因此，这三年尽管天灾重，但人心齐，棉花亩产量仍保持在一百四十斤左右。
    一九六一年和一九六二年又连续向社员进行了社会主义教育，一九六三年获得了棉花亩产的历史最高纪录，粮食、林业、牧畜业、副业也有了很大发展。
    近二年，忽视政治，生产就溜了下坡！
    这一连串的回忆，使大家更深刻地认识到，阶级斗争一抓就灵，只有抓革命，才能促生产。什么时候忘记了阶级斗争，不抓革命，什么时候生产必然要下降。因此，今后一定要永远听毛主席的话，以政治统帅生产，以阶级斗争统帅生产斗争，把活学活用毛主席著作，摆到党支部议事日程上来，摆在一切工作的首位，不断提高全体干部、社员为革命种田的自觉性，生产越富，越要革命。
