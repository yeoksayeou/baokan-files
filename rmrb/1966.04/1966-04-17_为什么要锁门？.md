    The handover team of our factory's casting workshop is a "Five-Good" team that has been recognized for several years in a row. In 1964, the factory's political department established them as a model for all workers to learn from, truly making them famous.
    During the final "Five-Good" assessment last year, the handover team was once again rated as a "Five-Good" team. However, brother teams also gave the handover team many "gifts." One of them, upon hearing it, made the acting team leader Xu Shoushen feel very uncomfortable. This comment was: people from the handover team often chat in a small room near the team. Xu Shoushen hurriedly returned to the team, and coincidentally, there were several people sitting in the small room. Xu Shoushen was furious: "You're still chatting! People have already made comments to us." Upon hearing this, the people didn't know what was happening, and stared at each other with wide eyes. Two of them, seeing that the "situation" wasn't right, left without saying a word. These two people were workers from a brother workshop responsible for transporting parts. At the time, because the parts had all been transported, the two of them casually stepped into the small room and chatted with another worker. This was during the five to seven PM power outage in the workshop, so this worker was resting in the small room.
    Xu Shoushen saw these people leaving the small room one by one in silence, and also felt that he had been a bit rash just now. However, when he thought of the "gifts" given by the brother teams, he always had a knot in his heart. He plopped down on a stool and pondered.
    Xu Shoushen thought about it, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that this small room was a place that "invited disaster." If this continued, maybe even the "Five-Good" team plaque would have to be moved. Just then, the Party group leader Zhang Zhenhai came. Xu Shoushen immediately said, "Master Zhang, you've come at the right time. Other teams have made comments to our handover team." Zhang Zhenhai said, "What comments, about what aspect?"
    Xu said, "The other comments aren't much, it's just that people in our team often chat in this small room during work hours."
    "Then let's do some ideological work."
    "How do we do it? I think a simple solution would be to get a lock and lock the door of this room, wouldn't that solve the problem?"
    Zhang Zhenhai said, "The problem might not be that simple, right? If you lock the door, if people want to chat, if they're not in the room, isn't it the same outside!"
    Xu Shoushen quickly interjected, "The truly chatting in the small room, there are only one or two from our team, most of them are from outside workshops."
    The two of them argued for a long time, and the result was still like a cow's hoof—split in half. The next day, Xu Shoushen found a door latch from somewhere and hammered it onto the door with a few loud bangs. Just then, the Party branch secretary of the team, Wang Jinsheng, came.
    "How is it? The 'Five-Good' assessment is almost over, do comrades have any feedback?" Xu Shoushen rolled his eyes a few times and shook his head, saying, "I haven't heard anything yet." Wang Jinsheng then asked, "What are the comrades' views on the comments that the brother teams have made to us?"
    "Haven't heard any feedback yet."
    "What about you?"
    "Me!" Xu Shoushen paused for a moment and then said, "I feel that in these comments, some of them are inaccurate."
    "Tell me about it."
    "Saying that people in our handover team sit in the small room when they have nothing to do, this comment isn't very fitting."
    "Then would you say there has been that phenomenon?"
    "There is, but there aren't many people from our handover team." Upon hearing this, Wang Jinsheng understood a large part of it: his intention to lock the door wasn't entirely to prevent his own people from entering the small room again, but to show the brother teams who made the comments: the door is locked, see what other comments you have! Thinking of this, Wang Jinsheng asked Xu Shoushen again, "I heard you're going to lock the door of the small room?"
    "Yes."
    "Why?"
    "Lock the door, no one will be able to enter, that way it won't attract 'trouble,' and no one will give us comments."
    Wang Jinsheng then said, "But now the workers are saying this about your plan to lock the door, 'Lock it, so what! If we don't sit in the room, squatting outside is just as good.'"
    "Who said that?" Xu Shoushen became a little anxious.
    "Don't worry, I also see this problem this way. Locking the door can only lock the door, but you can't lock people's thoughts..."
    After this heart-to-heart talk, Xu Shoushen's attitude towards locking the door also wavered. Although the door latch was nailed on, it was never locked. Party branch secretary Wang Jinsheng felt that although the lock on the door wasn't locked, the "lock" in some people's minds hadn't been completely opened. If this "lock" wasn't opened, the brother teams' criticisms wouldn't be heeded, and the handover team's progress would be hindered. So what key should be used to open this "lock"? The most effective key is the golden key of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, Wang Jinsheng conducted a detailed investigation and study among the masses, and then began to "unlock."
    On the day of "unlocking," branch secretary Wang Jinsheng, acting team leader Xu Shoushen, and several production group leaders first conducted a comprehensive summary of the handover team's work over the past year, and then compared it with the brother teams. Everyone unanimously agreed that although the handover team's achievements were not small, the brother teams had also greatly leaped forward. Wang Jinsheng said, "If we don't have a correct assessment of this leap forward situation where you chase me and I chase you, it's easy to fall into blind pride and complacency. If we don't admit that even advanced teams still have shortcomings, and can't humbly listen to others' opinions, then this advanced team will slowly become a backward team." Speaking of this, Wang Jinsheng opened "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and read word by word, "Even if our work has achieved extremely great successes, there is no reason whatsoever to feel conceited and arrogant. Modesty helps one to go forward, whereas conceit makes one lag behind. This is a truth we must always bear in mind." Chairman Mao's words deeply touched Xu Shoushen and several other comrades. Xu Shoushen said, "I used to think that the handover team was a well-known advanced collective in the factory. If such a team still has so many problems, how can it still be an advanced team? I originally wanted to lock the door to seal the mouths of others, but I didn't expect that the door hadn't been locked yet, and everyone already had opinions about this approach. My idea of locking the door was to refuse others to give opinions, it was the pride in my mind that was at work..."
    After the "lock" was opened, everyone felt much more relaxed. On a holiday, Zhang Zhenhai, Xu Shoushen, Wang Yutang and other Party, government, labor union group leaders visited more than a dozen old workers. When people learned that the leading cadres of the handover team had come to solicit opinions, everyone was very touched, and at the same time, they sincerely put forward suggestions for improvement. The crane group leader Guo Fengqi said, "Your handover team deserves to be a good example for the whole factory to learn from. Our crane group has more problems than you do, but we haven't done this yet."
    Now, the door of the handover team's small room is still open. Sometimes, there are still people sitting inside, but they are seriously studying Chairman Mao's works. (Attached picture)

    为什么要锁门？
    北京长辛店机车车辆工厂工人　刘寿昌
    我们厂的铸工车间交活工段，是个连续几年得到“五好”称号的工段。一九六四年，工厂政治部又树立他们为全厂职工学习的样板，这可真是对着门缝吹喇叭——名声在外了。
    去年年终“五好”总评的后期，交活工段又被评为“五好”工段。但是兄弟班组也给交活工段送了不少“礼物”。其中有一条，代理工段长许守申一听，就火辣辣地直难受。这条意见是：交活工段的人有时常在工段附近的一间小屋里聊天。许守申急忙回到工段，说也巧，这时正有几个人在小屋里坐着呢。许守申一看就火了：“你们还瞎聊呢！人家都给咱们提出意见来了。”这几个人一听，不知是怎么回事，大眼瞪小眼地瞪起来了。有两个人，一看这“苗头”不对，一句话没说就走了。走的这两人是兄弟车间负责运送配件的工人，当时因为配件都运完了，两个人信步跨进这间小屋子里便和另外一个工人聊上了。这时是下午五——七点车间停电时间，所以这个工人正坐在小屋子里休息。
    许守申看到这几个人，一个个不声不响地离开了小屋，也觉得刚才有点冒失了。可是他一想起兄弟班组给送的“礼物”，心里总是有一个疙瘩。他一屁股坐在板凳上，在那里沉思了起来。
    许守申想来想去，越想越觉得这间小屋子是个“招灾惹祸”的地方。如果这样下去，没准儿连“五好”工段的牌牌儿都要挪动了。正在这时，党小组长张振海来了。许守申开口就说：“张师傅，你来得正好。别的班给咱们交活工段提出了意见。”张振海说：“什么意见，关于哪方面的？”
    许说：“别的意见也不多，就是说咱们工段里的人，工作时常在这个小屋子里聊天。”
    “那咱们就做做思想工作呗。”
    “怎么做呀？我看来个干脆的，弄把锁把这屋门一锁，不就把问题解决了吗？”
    张振海说：“问题不会这么简单吧，你把门锁上，如果有人聊天，不在屋里，外边不也是一样吗！”
    许守申忙接过来说：“真正在小屋里聊天的，咱们工段的没有一两个，大部分都是外车间的。”
    这两人争论了好一阵子，结果还是牛蹄子——两半着。第二天，许守申不知从哪儿找来了一个门连吊儿，当当几锤头就钉在门上了。正在这时候，工段党支部书记王金生来了。
    “怎么样？‘五好’快评完了，同志们有什么反映吗？”许守申两个眼珠子转了几转，摇摇头说：“还没听到。”王金生又问：“同志们对兄弟班组给咱们提的那些意见，怎么个看法？”
    “还没有听到什么反映。”
    “你呢？”
    “我！”许守申停了一会儿又说：“我觉得这些意见里，有的提得有出入。”
    “你说说看。”
    “说咱们交活工段的人没事就坐在小屋子聊天吧，这个意见就不十分贴题。”
    “那你说是不是有过那现象？”
    “有是有，不过咱们交活工段的人不多。”王金生一听心里明白了一大半：他锁门的用意不完全是不叫自己人再进小屋里去，而是给提意见的兄弟班组看看：门锁上了，看你们还有什么意见！王金生想到这儿，就又问许守申：“听说你要把小屋的门锁上？”
    “是。”
    “为什么？”
    “锁上门，谁也别想进去了，这样就不会惹‘是非’，没有人给咱们提意见了。”
    王金生又说：“可是现在工人们对你要锁门的事，这么说，‘锁，锁呗！不在屋里坐，外边蹲着也不错。’”
    “谁说的？”许守申有点急了。
    “别着急嘛，这个问题我也是这样看，你锁门只能把门锁住，可人的思想你是锁不住的……”
    经过这次谈心，许守申对锁门的办法也发生了动摇，门连吊儿虽然钉上了，却一直没有上锁。党支部书记王金生觉得，这门上的锁虽然不锁了，而在某些人思想里的“锁”还没完全打开。如果不把这把“锁”开开，兄弟班组的批评意见就听不进去，交活工段前进的步伐就会受到阻碍。那么这把“锁”用什么钥匙开呢？最灵的钥匙就是用毛泽东思想这把金钥匙了。于是，王金生在群众中作了细致的调查研究以后就开始“开锁”啦。
    “开锁”的那天，支部书记王金生、代理工段长许守申和几个生产组长一起，首先对交活工段一年来的工作，进行了全面的总结，然后又跟兄弟班组进行了比较。大伙一致认为，交活工段的成绩虽然不小，可兄弟班组也大大地跃进了一步。王金生说：“这个你追我赶的跃进形势，如果我们没有一个正确的估计，就很容易陷入盲目的骄傲自满。如果不承认先进班组还有不足之处，不能虚心听取别人的意见，那这个先进班组，就会慢慢变成后进。”说到这儿，王金生就翻开了《毛主席语录》，一字一句地念道：“即使我们的工作得到了极其伟大的成绩，也没有任何值得骄傲自大的理由。虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后，我们应当永远记住这个真理。”毛主席的这段话，深深打动了许守申等几个同志。许守申说：“我过去认为，交活工段是全厂有名的先进集体，如果这样的工段还有这么多问题，怎么还能成为先进工段呀。我原想锁了门就封住了别人的嘴，可没想到门还没上锁，大家对这个做法又有了意见。我锁门的想法，就是拒绝别人提意见，是骄傲思想在作怪。……”
    “锁”打开以后，大家的身上觉得轻松了好多。就在一个放假的日子里，张振海、许守申、王玉堂等几个党政工团小组长，先后走访十几位老工人。当人们知道交活工段的领导干部是来登门征求意见的时候，大家很感动，同时也很诚恳地提出了改进意见。天车组的组长郭凤启说：“你们交活工段不愧为全厂学习的好榜样。我们天车组的问题比你们多，可是我们还没有这样做哩。”
    现在，交活工段小屋子的门仍然开着，有时，里边也还是有人坐着，但是，他们正翻开毛主席的著作，严肃地学习着。（附图片）
