    Encirclement and Counter-Encirclement
    He Jiang
    In order to realize its counter-revolutionary global strategy, U.S. imperialism has distributed its military forces throughout the world and established a network of military bases. It has also created a so-called "crescent arc" around China in an attempt to encircle China. In fact, on today's Earth, it is not China that is being encircled, but precisely U.S. imperialism that is being encircled by the people of the world. As Comrade Mao Zedong said: "U.S. imperialism has stretched its hands out too far. Every time it invades a place, it puts a new noose around its own neck. It has already fallen into the heavy encirclement of the people of the world."
    U.S. imperialism has itself mobilized the people of various countries to encircle it. The more it intensifies its aggression and encirclement of other countries' people, the more it falls into the people's encirclement. The development of things always goes against the wishes of U.S. imperialism.
    The situation in South Vietnam is a good example. The American invaders, with their massive military power, encircled the South Vietnamese people from the ground, from the sea, and from the air,妄想想to eliminate the South Vietnamese people's armed forces. What was the result? On the battlefield, although the American invading army was operating on the outer lines, it was divided, encircled, and annihilated by the South Vietnamese people's armed forces in campaigns and battles. The outer lines became inner lines, and the encirclers were counter-encircled. The "strategic hamlets" built by the U.S. puppets were originally intended to trap the South Vietnamese people, but they became combat villages for the South Vietnamese people to strike at the American robbers. The cities and strongholds heavily guarded by the U.S. military, originally intended as bases for expanding the occupied areas, have fallen into the encirclement of the liberated areas, like isolated islands in the sea. Even within these cities, it is not the world of the American invaders. Not only do the people's armed forces appear and disappear miraculously, displaying their great power, but also the anti-American struggle of the people of all strata is surging forward. The recent large-scale anti-American demonstrations in Saigon and other cities have frightened the U.S. imperialist ringleaders. Today in South Vietnam, is it U.S. imperialism with its "air and sea superiority" that encircles the South Vietnamese people, or is it the American invaders who have fallen into the encirclement of fourteen million South Vietnamese people? Isn't it crystal clear?
    The situation is the same not only in South Vietnam, but also in the entire intermediate zone. Everywhere U.S. imperialism establishes military bases and stations troops, it damages the sovereignty of other countries and infringes on their independence. This cannot but arouse the anger of the broad masses of people. U.S. imperialism organizes various military blocs and ties some countries to the American chariot, which cannot but arouse the resistance of the people of these countries. U.S. imperialism originally wanted to place the vast intermediate zone under its control and form an encirclement of the socialist countries. The result, however, has been the opposite. Its interference, control, aggression, and enslavement of the intermediate zone, especially the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have precisely mobilized the people of these countries to rise up against U.S. imperialism, forming an encirclement around it.
    U.S. imperialism's frenzied aggression abroad inevitably leads to intensified attacks on the American people at home. In this way, it has also mobilized the American people to oppose their own country's imperialism. It was precisely when the Johnson administration expanded the war of aggression against Vietnam that the American people launched an unprecedentedly large-scale movement against the war of aggression against Vietnam. Thus, the American people, together with the Vietnamese people and the people of the world, have joined the great encirclement of U.S. imperialism.
    The great encirclement of U.S. imperialism is formed by the convergence of the anti-American struggles of the people of various countries. The higher the anti-American struggles of the people of various countries rise, the more the international anti-American united front expands, and the tighter and more intensified the encirclement of U.S. imperialism by the people of the world becomes.
    Imperialists have always been a small handful, always a minority. When the oppressed people and oppressed nations have not yet risen up, they rush about wildly, appearing very arrogant. But when the masses of people awaken, take action, and attack imperialism en masse, imperialism will be drowned in the vast ocean of the people's struggle. The imperialist aggressors of history have gone to their doom in this way. Today's U.S. imperialism cannot escape this fate either.
    U.S. imperialism is stepping step by step into the dragnet of the people of the world. Its doomsday is not far away.

    包围和反包围
    何江
    美帝国主义为了实现它的反革命全球战略，把自己的军事力量分布到全世界，建立了星罗棋布的军事基地。它并且在中国周围搞什么“新月形弧线”，想把中国包围起来。其实，在今天的地球上，根本不是中国被包围，恰恰是美帝国主义被全世界人民所包围。正如毛泽东同志所说的：“美帝国主义的手伸得太长了。它每侵略一个地方，就把一条新的绞索套在自己的脖子上。它已经陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。”
    美帝国主义是自己把各国人民动员起来包围自己的。它越是加紧侵略和包围别国人民，越是陷入人民的重围。事情的发展，总是走向美帝国主义愿望的反面。
    南越的情况，就是一个很好的例子。美国侵略者以其庞大的军事力量，从地面、从海洋、从天空对南越人民进行包围，妄想把南越人民武装力量吃掉。结果如何呢？在战场上，美国侵略军虽然是外线作战，可是在战役和战斗中它却被南越人民武装所分割、所包围、所歼灭。外线变成了内线，包围者反被包围。美伪修筑的“战略村”，本来是要围困南越人民的，结果变成了南越人民打击美国强盗的战斗村。美军重兵把守的城市和据点，本来是作为扩大敌占区的基地的，结果却陷于解放区的包围之中，就象大海中的孤岛。即使在这些城市里边，也不是美国侵略者的天下。那里不但人民武装力量神出鬼没，大显神威，而且各阶层人民的反美斗争也风起云涌。最近在西贡等城市爆发的反美大示威，就吓得美帝国主义头目胆战心惊。今天在南越，究竟是拥有“海空优势”的美帝国主义包围了南越人民，还是美国侵略者陷入一千四百万南越人民的包围之中，难道不是清清楚楚的吗？
    在南越一地是如此，在整个中间地带也是如此。美帝国主义到处建立军事基地，驻扎军队，就要损害别国的主权，侵犯别国的独立，这就不能不激起广大人民的怒火。美帝国主义组织各种各样的军事集团，把一些国家拴上美国的战车，这也就不能不激起这些国家的人民的抵抗。美帝国主义本来是想把广大中间地带置于自己的控制之下，形成对社会主义国家的包围。结果却适得其反。它对中间地带的干涉、控制、侵略、奴役，恰恰动员了中间地带首先是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民起来反对美帝国主义，形成对它的包围。
    美帝国主义对外疯狂进行侵略，对内必然要加紧向美国人民进攻。这样，它又把美国人民动员起来反对本国的帝国主义。正是在约翰逊政府扩大侵越战争的时候，美国人民掀起了空前规模的反对侵越战争的运动。这样，美国人民就同越南人民一起，同全世界人民一起，参加了对美帝国主义的大包围。
    对美帝国主义的大包围，是由各国人民的反美斗争互相汇合而形成的。各国人民的反美斗争越是高涨，国际反美统一战线越是扩大，全世界人民对美帝国主义的包围也就越严密，越加紧。
    帝国主义者从来就是一小撮人，从来就是少数。当被压迫人民和被压迫民族还没有起来的时候，他们横冲直撞，好象神气得很。但是当人民大众觉悟起来，行动起来，对帝国主义群起而攻之，帝国主义就要在人民斗争的汪洋大海中遭到灭顶。历史上的帝国主义侵略者，就是这样走向灭亡的。今天的美帝国主义也逃不掉这种命运。
    美帝国主义正在一步一步地陷入世界人民的天罗地网。它的末日不会很远了。
