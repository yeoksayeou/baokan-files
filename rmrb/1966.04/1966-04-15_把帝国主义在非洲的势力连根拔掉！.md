	Today is "Africa Freedom Day." On the African continent, the thrones of imperialist rule are collapsing one after another; the flames of anti-imperialist struggle are raging everywhere. On the eve of the complete collapse of the imperialist colonial system, the African people are engaged in an exceptionally sharp and fierce struggle with imperialism and old and new colonialism, headed by the United States.
	Since the end of World War II, the anti-imperialist struggle of the African people has achieved tremendous victories. Despite twists and turns and reversals, the tide of the African revolution is still like a surging torrent, developing rapidly and vigorously. In the first decade after the war, the struggle for national independence unfolded throughout Africa. The people who had been oppressed and enslaved for centuries rose up to fight for freedom from colonial shackles and for independence and liberty. In the latter decade, the old colonial system of imperialism in Africa disintegrated like an avalanche. Since 1955, the number of independent African countries has grown from four to thirty-six. The population and area of these countries already account for more than eighty percent of the total population and area of Africa. The sleeping Africa has awakened. The anti-imperialist struggle of the African people, merging with the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asia and Latin America, has formed a great historical current in the world today.
	However, all reactionary and decadent forces will never resign themselves to extinction. This is a universal law of class struggle. As Comrade Mao Zedong said, imperialism and reactionaries "are not reconciled to their failure in Africa and will never voluntarily withdraw from the stage of history. Whether in the past, present, or future, imperialism and reactionaries will always try their best to obstruct and undermine the cause of independence and progress of the people of African countries." The reality in Africa proves that Comrade Mao Zedong's thesis is entirely correct.
	In recent years, changes of power in African countries have been continuous. Especially in sub-Saharan Africa, military coups have occurred frequently. In the recent four months or so, as many as six coups have occurred successively in countries such as Congo (Kinshasa), Dahomey, Central African Republic, Upper Volta, Nigeria, and Ghana. This phenomenon of frequent coups is rare in the past.
	So far, the changes of power that have occurred in Africa, apart from the fact that in some countries patriotic democratic forces have overthrown the reactionary rule of the running dogs of imperialism, or that they belong to factional disputes within the ruling group, most are counter-revolutionary military coups engineered and planned by imperialism. These coups fall into the following types:
	One type is the incitement by imperialism of reactionary soldiers to overthrow national governments or leaders with nationalist tendencies who adhere to an independent and autonomous policy.
	Another type is the rule of imperialist puppets, which can no longer be sustained due to the dissatisfaction and resistance of the masses of the people. Therefore, imperialism plays the trick of changing horses, on the one hand, to deceive the people, and on the other hand, to strengthen the suppression of the people.
	Still another type is the infighting and mutual exclusion between old and new colonialism in order to compete for spheres of influence, with the agent of one imperialism replacing the agent of another imperialism.
	The above situations fully demonstrate the sharpness and complexity of the struggle between the African people and old and new colonialism.
	A series of reactionary coups in Black Africa have sounded the alarm for the African people. It shows that imperialism and colonialism are not dead in Africa. They not only want to maintain their vested interests in Africa, but also want to regain the positions they have lost. The struggle of the African people against imperialism and old and new colonialism is far from over. Opposing imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, and thoroughly eliminating all the forces of imperialism and old and new colonialism on the African continent remain the primary tasks of the African people.
	In order to disintegrate the anti-imperialist revolutionary movement in Africa, the Khrushchev revisionists have tried their best to propagate that imperialism has become "smarter" and that they will automatically "withdraw from the colonies"; that "the national liberation movement has entered the final stage of eliminating the colonial system"; that "in the new stage of the national liberation revolution, socio-economic issues have become the key issues," and so on. It is very obvious that this set of fallacies of the Khrushchev revisionists is to lead the African people astray and serve imperialism.
	May I ask, which imperialism has ever easily given up colonial rule voluntarily? The old Portuguese colonialists have reached the point where the sun is setting in the west, and today they still occupy colonies in Africa that are twenty-two times larger than their homeland, and they refuse to let go. If tiny Portugal is still like this, let alone other colonial empires.
	Has the elimination of the colonial system entered the "final stage"? The only argument the Khrushchev revisionists can come up with is that the colonial population only accounts for 1.5 percent of the world's population. This absurd numbers game is nothing more than an attempt to cover up the cruel fact that old and new colonialism continues to carry out aggression in many parts of the world, especially in Africa.
	The Khrushchev revisionists promote that the current key issue for African countries is only socio-economic issues. This statement is actually to ask African countries to completely cancel the struggle against imperialism and make the national democratic revolution die halfway.
	What is the reality in Africa? While people see the great and historically significant victories achieved by the national liberation movement in Africa, they should also see that imperialism has not only not withdrawn from Africa, but is also launching a frantic counterattack.
	When the people rise up to resist colonial rule, imperialism carries out bloody armed suppression. Wherever they can rely on, they try their best to struggle to maintain the old colonial rule.
	When imperialism can no longer maintain its rule in many parts of Africa as before, they change their methods and adopt neo-colonialist methods. They can be forced to agree to the declaration of independence of some African countries, but they still continue to control and invade these countries in various fields such as politics, economy, military, and culture.
	For those African countries that pursue an independent and autonomous policy and insist on opposing imperialism, imperialism seeks every opportunity to sabotage, interfere, and subvert, and tries to make a comeback and implement colonialist restoration.
	Imperialism has also created puppet regimes like that in Congo (Kinshasa) in Africa, and supports white colonial rule in countries like South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. Imperialism uses them as strongholds for stubborn resistance and counter-offensive against the African national liberation movement.
	It should be particularly pointed out that U.S. imperialism is infiltrating the African continent everywhere, becoming the most ferocious and insidious enemy of the African people. Wherever a revolutionary struggle breaks out, U.S. imperialism is bound to directly or indirectly participate in the suppression. Whenever a country insists on an independent and autonomous policy, U.S. imperialism will interfere and subvert. As the main stronghold of modern colonialism, U.S. imperialism not only tries its best to support the old colonialists and put out the African revolution, but also tries to replace the position of the old colonialists by supporting its own agents and carrying out economic penetration, etc., vainly attempting to become the new slave owner of the African continent.
	Imperialism and old and new colonialism cannot be driven away or defeated without a fight. The African people have accumulated rich experience in the practice of struggle. They have both successful experiences and lessons of failure. They have drawn an important conclusion from the victory and failure, success and setbacks of the revolution: the national democratic revolution must be continued to be pushed forward, and the struggle against imperialism must be carried out to the end.
	The task facing the African people who have not yet freed themselves from colonial shackles is to overthrow the brutal rule of imperialism and its running dogs with revolutionary violence and strive for independence and liberation.
	The task facing the African countries that have already gained independence is to thoroughly eliminate all the forces of imperialism and old and new colonialism in the political, economic, military, and cultural fields. Only in this way can the revolutionary achievements that have been achieved be defended. Only in this way can complete independence be won.
	Faced with the frantic counterattack of imperialism, the people of all African countries now need to strengthen unity more than ever. In every country, there are different classes and strata, different political factions and political forces. This is the case in all countries in the world, and it is also the case in African countries. Opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism is the highest interest of African countries. With a major enemy in front of them, all patriotic and democratic forces in African countries, except for the running dogs of imperialism, are fully qualified to unite closely and form the broadest anti-imperialist national united front.
	Faced with the frantic counterattack of imperialism, the people of all African countries now also need to strengthen the anti-imperialist unity of the entire Africa, and strengthen the unity with the anti-imperialist revolutionary forces in Asia, Latin America, and the world. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of all African countries are closely linked together. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the African people and the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of all countries in the world support each other.
	A series of reactionary coups engineered by imperialism in Black Africa have raised the following question for people: How should the current African situation be viewed and assessed? Imperialism and its followers seem to be spirited up. They think the wind direction in Africa has changed. The London Times bluntly wrote that it hoped there would be a "turning point" in the African situation. However, the history of Africa is not developing according to the will of imperialism and its followers, but according to the will of the African people.
	Today, the anti-imperialist revolutionary tide of the people of all African countries is rising wave upon wave, and is continuing to develop. The people of African countries and regions that have not gained independence are persisting in armed struggle. Although some countries have retreated on the road of revolution under the inducement of imperialism, some countries adhere to the position of opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism, and fight at the forefront of the united anti-imperialist front in Africa.
	The African people who have stood up dare to fight against seemingly powerful enemies, break the colonial shackles, and strive for national liberation; dare to maintain the achievements of the revolutionary victory, and oppose the aggression and interference of imperialism and old and new colonialism—this is the main stream of the African situation.
	Today's African countries are facing a serious struggle between two futures and two destinies: either to repel the attack of imperialism and its running dogs and resolutely continue to push forward the national democratic revolution in accordance with the wishes of the people; or to be overwhelmed by the counterattack of imperialism and temporarily return to their de facto colonies, returning to the position of being enslaved, oppressed, and exploited. The problem is placed so sharply in front of the African people.
	In the final analysis, the future of Africa and the destiny of Africa can only be decided by the African people. Even if imperialism may succeed temporarily in some countries, the people of these countries will surely rise up again and continue to struggle until the forces of imperialism and colonialism are driven out. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "the people's revolution can be victorious, and imperialism and its running dogs can be defeated. The whole of Africa is now in a wave of opposition to imperialism and opposition to colonialism. Whether it is a country that has already gained independence or a country that has not yet gained independence, it will one day gain complete and thorough independence and liberation."
	The recent counterattack of imperialism in Africa has aroused great anger among progressive African countries and all African people. A new anti-imperialist upsurge is rising on the African continent. The struggle of the African people has won the sympathy and support of the people all over the world. The 650 million Chinese people resolutely stand on the side of the African people, condemn the criminal activities of imperialism, and support the just struggle of the African people.
	The general trend of Africa moving towards progress rather than reaction cannot be changed by anyone. Despite the difficulties and twists and turns on the road forward, the African people will surely be able to carry the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle through to the end, and will surely be able to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly uproot the forces of imperialism and old and new colonialism from the African continent. A new, independent, free, and prosperous Africa will stand in the world like the majestic Mount Kilimanjaro.

### 把帝国主义在非洲的势力连根拔掉！

    把帝国主义在非洲的势力连根拔掉！
    今天是“非洲自由日”。非洲的大地上，帝国主义的统治宝座，一个又一个地倒塌；反帝斗争的烈火，到处熊熊燃烧。在帝国主义殖民体系彻底崩溃的前夕，非洲人民同以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义之间，正在展开异常尖锐和激烈的斗争。
    第二次世界大战结束以来，非洲人民的反帝斗争，取得了巨大的胜利。非洲革命的浪潮尽管有曲折、有反复，但是，仍然象万马奔腾，迅速猛烈地向前发展。战后的前十年，争取民族独立的斗争在整个非洲普遍展开。几世纪来被压迫、被奴役的人民，为了挣脱殖民枷锁、争取独立和自由而奋起斗争。到了后十年，帝国主义在非洲的旧的殖民体系，就象雪崩一样地瓦解。一九五五年以后，非洲的独立国家从四个发展到了三十六个。这些国家的人口和面积，已经占全非洲总人口和总面积的百分之八十以上。沉睡的非洲觉醒了。非洲人民的反帝斗争，同亚洲和拉丁美洲人民的反帝斗争汇合起来，形成了当今世界一股伟大的历史潮流。
    但是，一切反动的腐朽的势力，绝不会自甘灭亡。这是阶级斗争的普遍规律。正如毛泽东同志所说，帝国主义和反动派“是不甘心于自己在非洲的失败的，是决不会自动退出历史舞台的。无论过去、现在和将来，帝国主义和反动派总是要千方百计地阻挠和破坏非洲各国人民的独立和进步的事业。”非洲的现实，证明了毛泽东同志的论断是完全正确的。
    近几年来，非洲国家的政权更迭，连续不断。特别是在撒哈拉以南的非洲，军事政变层出不穷。最近四个多月内，就在刚果（利）、达荷美、中非共和国、上沃尔特、尼日利亚和加纳等国连续地发生了六次之多。这种政变频仍的现象，在过去是罕见的。
    迄今为止，在非洲所发生的政权更迭，除了在某些国家是爱国民主力量推翻帝国主义走狗的反动统治，或者是属于统治集团内部的派系之争以外，大部分是帝国主义制造和策划的反革命军事政变。这些政变，不外乎以下几种类型：
    一种是帝国主义策动反动军人，推翻那些坚持独立自主政策的民族政府或具有民族主义倾向的领导人。
    另一种是，帝国主义傀儡的统治，由于人民群众的不满和反抗，再也维持不下去了，于是，帝国主义就玩弄换马的把戏，一方面借以欺骗人民，同时也加强对人民的镇压。
    再一种是，新老殖民主义之间，为了争夺势力范围，勾心斗角，相互排挤，这个帝国主义的代理人取代另一个帝国主义的代理人。
    以上这些情况，充分说明了非洲人民同新老殖民主义之间的斗争的尖锐性和复杂性。
    黑非洲的一系列反动政变，给非洲人民敲起了警钟。它说明，帝国主义和殖民主义在非洲并没有死亡。它们不仅要保持在非洲的既得利益，并且还要夺回已经丧失的阵地。非洲人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争还远远没有结束。反对帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，彻底肃清帝国主义和新老殖民主义在非洲大陆上的一切势力，仍然是非洲人民的首要任务。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者为了瓦解非洲的反帝革命运动，他们竭力宣传：帝国主义变得“聪明”了，它们会自动地“退出殖民地”；“民族解放运动进入了消灭殖民主义制度的完成阶段”；“在民族解放革命的新阶段中，社会经济问题成为关键性的问题”，等等。十分明显，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的这一套谬论，是要把非洲人民引入歧途，为帝国主义效劳。
    试问，哪个帝国主义曾经轻易地自行放弃殖民统治呢？葡萄牙老殖民主义者已经到了日薄西山的地步，今天在非洲仍然霸占着比它本土大二十二倍的殖民地，死不肯放手。小小的葡萄牙尚且如此，其他的殖民帝国就更不用说了。
    消灭殖民制度已经进入了“完成阶段”吗？赫鲁晓夫修正主义者拿得出的唯一论据是：殖民地人口只占世界人口的百分之一点五了。这种荒唐的数字游戏，无非是要掩饰新老殖民主义仍然在世界的许多地方，特别是在非洲继续实行侵略的残酷事实。
    赫鲁晓夫修正主义者宣扬非洲国家当前的关键性问题只是社会经济问题，这种说法实际上是要非洲国家压根儿取消反对帝国主义的斗争，使民族民主革命半途而废。
    非洲的现实，究竟是怎样的呢？人们在看到非洲的民族解放运动取得具有历史意义的伟大胜利的同时，还应看到，帝国主义不但没有从非洲退出去，而且还在发动猖狂的反扑。
    当人民起来反抗殖民统治的时候，帝国主义就进行血腥的武装镇压。凡是它们能够赖下去的地方，它们就竭力挣扎，维护旧的殖民统治。
    当帝国主义在非洲许多地方的统治再也不能照旧维持下去的时候，它们就改变方式，采取新殖民主义的手法。它们可以被迫同意某些非洲国家宣布独立，但是仍然从政治、经济、军事和文化等各个领域里，继续对这些国家进行控制和侵略。
    对于那些奉行独立自主政策、坚持反对帝国主义的非洲国家，帝国主义就寻找一切机会进行破坏、干涉和颠覆，力图卷土重来，实行殖民主义复辟。
    帝国主义还在非洲制造了象刚果（利）那样的傀儡政权，支持象南非、南罗得西亚那样的白人殖民统治的国家。帝国主义利用它们作为负隅顽抗和向非洲民族解放运动反攻的据点。
    特别应当指出的是，美帝国主义无孔不入地侵入非洲大陆，成为非洲人民的最凶恶、最阴险的敌人。只要哪个地方爆发革命斗争，美帝国主义就一定直接地或间接地参与镇压。只要哪个国家坚持独立自主政策，美帝国主义就要进行干涉和颠覆。作为现代殖民主义主要堡垒的美帝国主义，不仅竭力支持老殖民主义者，扑灭非洲革命，而且还通过扶植自己的代理人和进行经济渗透等等办法，力图取代老殖民主义者的地位，妄想成为统治非洲大陆的新奴隶主。
    帝国主义和新老殖民主义，是不赶不走，不打不倒的。非洲人民在斗争实践中，已经积累了丰富的经验。他们既有成功的经验，也有失败的教训。他们从革命的胜利和失败、成功和挫折中，得出一个重要的结论：必须把民族民主革命继续推向前进，把反对帝国主义的斗争进行到底。
    还没有摆脱殖民枷锁的非洲人民面临的任务是，以革命的暴力推翻帝国主义及其走狗的残暴统治，争取独立和解放。
    已经取得独立的非洲国家面临的任务是，在政治、经济、军事和文化各个领域内彻底肃清帝国主义和新老殖民主义的一切势力。只有这样，才能够捍卫已经取得的革命成果。只有这样，才能够赢得完全的独立。
    面对着帝国主义的猖狂反扑，非洲各国人民现在比任何时候都需要加强团结。在每一个国家中，都有不同的阶级和阶层，不同的政治派别和政治力量。这在世界各国是如此，在非洲国家也是如此。反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义是非洲国家的最高利益。大敌当前，除了帝国主义的走狗以外，非洲各国的一切爱国民主力量完全有条件紧密地团结起来，结成最广泛的反帝民族统一战线。
    面对着帝国主义的猖狂反扑，非洲各国人民现在也比任何时候都需要加强全非洲的反帝团结，加强同亚洲、拉丁美洲和全世界反帝革命力量的团结。非洲各国人民的反帝革命斗争，是紧密地联系在一起的。非洲人民的反帝革命斗争，同世界各国人民的反帝革命斗争，也是互相支持的。
    帝国主义在黑非洲策动的一系列反动政变，向人们提出了这样一个问题：对当前的非洲局势，应当怎样看待，怎样估计？帝国主义及其追随者似乎神气起来了。他们认为非洲的风向变了。伦敦《泰晤士报》露骨地写道：希望非洲局势出现一个“转折点”。但是，非洲的历史，不是按照帝国主义及其追随者的意志，而是按照非洲人民的意志发展的。
    今天，非洲各国人民反帝革命潮流，一波未平，一波又起，正在持续不断地向前发展。没有取得独立的非洲国家和地区的人民正在坚持武装斗争。虽然有的国家在帝国主义的诱迫下，在革命道路上后退了，但是有的国家坚持反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的立场，战斗在非洲的团结反帝战线的前列。
    站立起来的非洲人民，敢于同貌似强大的敌人进行斗争，粉碎殖民枷锁，争取民族解放；敢于维护革命胜利的成果，反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的侵略和干涉，——这就是非洲形势的主流。
    今天的非洲各国，正面临着两个前途、两种命运的严重斗争：或者击退帝国主义及其走狗的进攻，坚决按照人民的愿望，把民族民主革命继续推向前进；或者被帝国主义的反扑压倒，暂时重新沦为它们事实上的殖民地，回到被奴役、被压迫和被剥削的地位。问题就是这样尖锐地摆在非洲人民的面前。
    归根结底，非洲的前途，非洲的命运，只能由非洲人民来决定。即使帝国主义可能在某些国家一时得逞，但是，这些国家的人民一定会重新起来，再接再厉地进行斗争，直到把帝国主义和殖民主义势力驱逐出去。毛泽东同志指出，“人民的革命是能够胜利的，帝国主义及其走狗是能够打败的。整个非洲现在都处在反对帝国主义和反对殖民主义的浪潮中。不管已经获得独立的国家，或者还没有获得独立的国家，总有一天是要获得完全彻底的独立和解放的。”
    帝国主义最近在非洲进行的反扑，已经激起了非洲进步国家和全体非洲人民的极大愤怒。一个新的反帝高潮，正在非洲大陆上兴起。非洲人民的斗争得到全世界人民的同情和支持。六亿五千万中国人民坚决站在非洲人民一边，谴责帝国主义的罪恶活动，支持非洲人民的正义斗争。
    非洲走向进步，而不是走向反动，这个历史的总趋向，是任何人也改变不了的。尽管在前进的道路上还有这样或那样的困难和曲折，非洲人民一定能够把反帝革命斗争进行到底，一定能够把帝国主义和新老殖民主义势力完全、彻底、干净地从非洲大陆上连根拔掉。一个独立、自由和繁荣的新非洲，将如雄伟的乞力马扎罗山那样屹立在世界上。
