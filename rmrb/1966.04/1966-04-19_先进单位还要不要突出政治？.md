    The Xiadingjia Brigade Answers: Class struggle exists everywhere. If we do not emphasize politics in any matter or at any stage, and do not use Mao Zedong Thought to take command, we will inevitably lose our direction and lead the work backwards.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 18th) Should advanced units, whose production has already been fundamentally transformed, continue to emphasize politics? Recently, the Xiadingjia Brigade of the Dalujia Commune in Huang County, Shandong Province, held a debate on this issue. Everyone realized that emphasizing politics is based on the laws of development of socialist society, and neither advanced nor backward units can violate it. Backward units that do not emphasize politics will not become advanced; advanced units that do not emphasize politics will become backward.
    Problem
    This debate was aimed at the lively thoughts of some cadres and commune members during the spring plowing and production. Last year, the Xiadingjia Brigade achieved a bumper harvest of an average of 950 jin per mu in a year of severe drought; this year, they put forward a plan to further increase production. The Party General Branch believes that the most fundamental guarantee for achieving this year's plan is to continue to emphasize politics and continue to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres and commune members. However, some people believe that when the production outlook is backward, it is necessary to emphasize politics heavily in order to change the backward outlook; for advanced units whose production outlook has been basically changed, the emphasis on politics can be relaxed. Some people also said: Our mountains, water, and fields have been transformed almost completely, so even if the emphasis on politics is a little less in the future, we will not regress. Other cadres and commune members believe that production has reached its peak, and maintaining this level is good enough. The Party General Branch seized on these lively thoughts and organized cadres and commune members to conduct a major debate.
    Recollection
    In the debate, the Party General Branch guided everyone to first recall two things: The first was the "Five-Good Commune Member" evaluation and reward system implemented by the brigade in 1963. This system stipulated that "Five-Good Commune Members" would be rewarded with cash prizes of five yuan, three yuan, and one yuan respectively. However, the implementation of this system caused ideological confusion among cadres and commune members. Some commune members with high awareness felt less confident about actively safeguarding collective interests and participating in labor because they received bonuses; individual commune members with backward ideas believed that safeguarding collective interests and actively laboring were the business of "Five-Good Commune Members" and had nothing to do with them. The result of implementing this reward system was that the work that year was like walking on a mountain road, full of rocks that tripped people up. The second was the 4.28 mu of land being improved in Shaohou starting in 1964. This piece of land was divided into twenty-four small plots, planned to be consolidated into three plots within two years, with the yield increasing from 3,000 jin to 6,000 jin. Tearing off this "hard bone" of land could set an example for the entire brigade to tear off other "hard bones." Improving this piece of land required a lot of effort and money, and some people said it was not worthwhile, and some people were unwilling to work. The production team cadre in charge of improving this piece of land did not earnestly solve the ideological problems of the masses, and plunged into the preparation of materials such as steel and explosives, thinking that the land could be improved once the steel and explosives were resolved. As a result, nearly two years have passed since the start of the improvement, and a lot of steel and explosives have been used, but less than half of the land has been improved.
    Cause
    Both of these things occurred after Xiadingjia had already joined the ranks of the advanced. Why did the Xiadingjia Brigade, which had already become an advanced unit, have these problems? Some people said: Ten fingers cannot be of equal length, and such practices are extremely individual phenomena in Xiadingjia, caused by temporary negligence on the part of the cadres. However, most people believe that although these two things are individual, they were not caused by temporary negligence on the part of the cadres, but because there are still remnants of bourgeois ideology in the minds of the cadres that see things but not people.
    Wang Yongxing, Secretary of the Brigade Party General Branch, also made a specific analysis of the case of the Fourth Production Team to further illustrate this issue. The Fourth Production Team is an advanced team in the Xiadingjia Brigade, and its production and construction have been relatively good in recent years. However, this year's spring plowing production is the opposite of the past: the progress of hoeing and watering wheat is relatively slow, and the preparations for spring plowing are not good enough. In particular, in the construction of the dam of the East Jian High Mountain Reservoir, some cadres sought to save effort and did not go to distant places to pick pure sand, but took the lead in picking coarse sand nearby, which affected the quality of the concrete. Why did such problems occur in this advanced unit? The original reason was that some cadres relaxed their ideological transformation, lacked revolutionary drive, and were not united with each other, which affected their work mood.
    Conclusion
    Everyone came to a common understanding from these things: Politics is class struggle. To emphasize politics, we must adhere to class struggle and the struggle between the two roads. In socialist society, class struggle exists at all times and in all places, and the emphasis on politics should also be emphasized at all times, in all matters, and in all places. Regardless of whether it is an advanced unit or a backward unit, if we do not emphasize politics in any matter or at any stage, and do not use Mao Zedong Thought to take command, we will inevitably lose our direction and lead the work backwards.
    Everyone also recalled the ten-year struggle of the Xiadingjia Brigade to control mountains and rivers, and positively demonstrated the great significance of emphasizing politics. Chen Tianfu, Secretary of the Dachenjia Party Branch, said that the Dachenjia Production Team built a pumping station last winter and this spring, which required thousands of cubic meters of stone. Carrying the stones to the pumping station required climbing a large slope of more than 300 meters. At that time, in addition to those who quarried stones, only six people could be spared to carry stones. Who should be sent? At this time, Chen Hengri, a 47-year-old Communist Party member, took five young people to undertake this task. Blood blisters and calluses grew on their shoulders, and the carrying pole felt like it was drilling into their bones when it touched their shoulders. However, they used the spirit of serving the people and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to encourage themselves. Chen Hengri said: "There are different divisions of labor in socialism, and this is the work we are assigned!" The young people said: If we were only trying to fill our own stomachs, we would have quit long ago. We are doing it for the revolution! They persisted to the end, carrying more than 2,000 cubic meters of stone and completing the pumping station ahead of schedule.
    Climax
    After everyone clarified the importance of emphasizing politics, they further linked it to the future production and construction tasks of the Xiadingjia Brigade. At present, the water conservancy construction of Xiadingjia is not very strong, and the irrigated area only accounts for 70% of the total cultivated area; in the event of a severe drought, the reservoir may still dry up; the remaining 30% is mostly terraced fields on high mountains. Everyone believes that the future production and construction tasks of the Xiadingjia Brigade are not easier, but more arduous. To complete these arduous tasks, we must continue to emphasize politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to take command, otherwise it will be difficult to move forward. Now, a high tide of high-standard and high-quality spring production has been set off.

### 先进单位还要不要突出政治？

    先进单位还要不要突出政治？
    下丁家大队回答：阶级斗争无处不有，那一件事，那一个环节上不突出政治，不用毛泽东思想挂帅，就势必迷失方向，把工作引向后退
    据新华社济南十八日电　生产面貌已经基本改变的先进单位是否还要继续突出政治？最近，山东省黄县大吕家公社下丁家大队围绕这个问题，进行了一场辩论。大家认识到：突出政治是根据社会主义社会的发展规律提出来的，无论先进单位还是后进单位，都不能违背。后进单位不突出政治不会变为先进；先进单位不突出政治就会变为落后。
    问题
    这场辩论，是针对春耕生产中部分干部和社员的活思想进行的。去年，下丁家大队在大旱之年夺得了平均亩产九百五十斤的大丰收；今年，他们提出了进一步提高产量的计划。党总支认为，要实现今年的计划，最根本的保证是继续突出政治，继续用毛泽东思想教育干部和社员。但是，有些人却认为，生产面貌落后时需要狠狠突出政治，为的是改变落后面貌；生产面貌已经得到基本改变的先进单位，突出政治就可以松口气了。有的人还说：咱的山、水、田已经改造得差不多了，今后就是突出政治差一点，也不会后退。还有的干部和社员认为产量到了顶，保住这个水平就满好了。党总支抓住这些活思想，组织干部和社员开展了一场大辩论。
    回忆
    在辩论中，党总支引导大家首先回忆了两件事：第一件是一九六三年大队实行的五好社员评比奖励制度。这项制度规定，对五好社员分别奖励现金五元、三元、一元。但是这个制度一推行，却引起了干部和社员思想混乱。一些觉悟高的社员，因为得了奖金，反而感到再积极维护集体利益，积极参加劳动，不够理直气壮；个别思想落后的社员认为维护集体利益和积极劳动是五好社员的事，和自己无关。实行这种奖励制度的结果，这一年的工作就象走山路一样，到处都是石头，直绊脚。第二件是一九六四年开始在哨后整的四亩二分八厘地。这片地大小二十四块，计划在两年内整成三块，产量由三千斤提高到六千斤。啃掉这块“硬骨头”地，可以为全大队啃其他“硬骨头”树立样板。整这块地，费力大，花钱多，有些人说不合算，有的人不愿出工。负责整这块地的生产队干部，没有认真解决群众的思想问题，一头钻进了钢材、炸药等物资准备工作里，认为钢材、炸药解决了，地就可以整好了。结果，从开始整到现在已近两年了，钢材、炸药用了不少，地却整了不到一半。
    原因
    这两件事都是下丁家已经跃入先进行列以后产生的。为什么已经成为先进单位的下丁家大队会有这样的问题呢？有的人说：十个指头不能一般齐，这样的做法，在下丁家是极个别的现象，是干部一时疏忽大意造成的。但是大部分人认为，这两件事虽是个别的，但却不是因为干部一时疏忽大意造成的，而是因为干部头脑里还有见物不见人的资产阶级思想残余。
    大队党总支书记王永幸还把第四生产队的事例具体地做了分析，进一步说明这个问题。第四生产队在下丁家大队中是一个先进队，几年来的生产建设都搞得比较好。可是今年的春耕生产一反往常：小麦划锄、浇水的进度都比较迟缓，春耕准备工作做得不够好，特别是在建筑东涧高山水库的大坝中，有些干部图省力，不去远处挑净沙，而带头在近处挑粗沙，影响了混凝土的质量。为什么这个先进单位会出现这样问题？原来是因为有些干部放松了对自己的思想改造，革命干劲不足了，相互之间不团结，影响了工作情绪。
    结论
    大家从这几件事中得出了一个共同的认识：政治，就是阶级斗争。突出政治，就必须坚持阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争。在社会主义社会，阶级斗争是无时无处不有的，突出政治也应该是时时、事事、处处突出。不管先进单位还是后进单位，那一件事，那一个环节上不突出政治，不用毛泽东思想挂帅，就势必要迷失方向，把工作引向后退。
    大家还回忆了下丁家大队十年来治山治水的斗争过程，从正面论证了突出政治的伟大意义。大陈家党支部书记陈天福说，去冬今春大陈家生产队建设一座扬水站，需要成千立方米的石头，把石头抬到扬水站，需要爬三百多米的大坡。当时，除了打石头的以外，只能抽出六个人抬石头。派谁去呢？这时，四十七岁的共产党员陈恒日带着五个青年承担了这项任务。他们肩上压起了血泡，又长起了硬茧，扁担一着肩膀，就钻骨似的疼，但是，他们用为人民服务、愚公移山的精神来鼓励自己。陈恒日说：“社会主义有不同的分工，咱分的就是这个工！”青年们说：要是只为了吃饱自己的肚子，早不干了，咱为的是革命！他们一直坚持到底，共抬石头两千多立方米，提前建成了这座扬水站。
    高潮
    大家明确了突出政治的重要意义后，又进一步联系到下丁家大队今后的生产建设任务。目前，下丁家的水利建设还不很过硬，水浇地面积只占全部耕地面积的百分之七十；遇到大旱，水库还可能干涸；剩下的百分之三十，大部分是高山梯田。大家认为：今后下丁家大队的生产建设任务不是轻松了，而是更加繁重。要完成这些繁重任务，必须继续突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，否则就会寸步难行。现在，已掀起了一个高标准高质量的春季生产高潮。
