    These days, all the Chinese people have been concerned about the heroic struggle of the comrades of our embassy in Indonesia against the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they are not afraid of violence, not afraid of sacrifice, and dare to resist the barbaric attacks of the Indonesian fascist thugs with their bare hands. They are willing to use their lives and blood to defend the dignity of the motherland and defend the five-star red flag. Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou was gloriously wounded for protecting our national flag from being desecrated by Indonesian fascist thugs. Now, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and some of the comrades who participated in this struggle have returned to the embrace of the motherland. We would like to express our highest respect and cordial greetings to Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, the heroic fighter on our diplomatic front, and other comrades in our embassy in Indonesia!
    The heroic deeds of Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and all the comrades of our embassy in Indonesia fully demonstrate the fearless heroism of the Chinese people. They are loyal to the revolution, loyal to the motherland, staunch and unyielding, and unafraid of danger. Faced with violence and in the face of overwhelming odds, they still stuck to their posts and fought bravely. Head can be broken, blood can flow, but the dignity of the motherland and the people must never be insulted! They are true proletarian hard bones.
    The heroic deeds of Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and his comrades-in-arms fully embody the revolutionary spirit of collectivism of the Chinese people. In the fight against the Indonesian right-wing fascist thugs, the Chinese Embassy was an indestructible fighting collective. They promoted a high degree of proletarian fraternal spirit, caring for each other, supporting each other, encouraging each other, and persisting in the struggle. They were united like one person in the face of counter-revolutionary violence. Zhao Xiaoshou stepped forward at the most critical moment, and was shot by Indonesian reactionary soldiers in order to protect his comrades and defend the national flag. This is the revolutionary heroism of the proletariat.
    The heroic deeds of Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and all the personnel of our embassy in Indonesia fully demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people who coldly confront all demons and monsters in the world and dare to despise imperialism and all reactionaries. Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and his comrades-in-arms, with their heroic spirit, greatly demoralized the Indonesian right-wing forces and dampened the arrogance of imperialism and all reactionaries. They not only set a glorious example for the Chinese people, but also greatly enhanced the ambition of the revolutionary people of the world, and are a great encouragement to the revolutionary people of all countries in struggle.
    The emergence of a heroic figure like Zhao Xiaoshou on our diplomatic front is by no means accidental. They grew up under the long-term nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought and under the long-term care and education of the Party. Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou has always insisted on studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works, creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, taking Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction, establishing a proletarian world outlook, and wholeheartedly serving the Chinese people and the people of the world. It is precisely because Mao Zedong Thought has taken deep root in his mind that Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou has grown from an ordinary young man into a proletarian fighter with noble revolutionary qualities and a high degree of revolutionary consciousness.
    "The spring breeze sends forth thousands of willow branches, and the six hundred million people of the Divine Land are all like Emperors Yao and Shun." This is a vivid portrayal of the emergence of heroes among the Chinese people in the great Mao Zedong era. On all fronts in the country, heroic model figures such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, Mai Xiande, and Jiao Yulu are constantly emerging. In foreign affairs, there have also been examples of nine comrades such as Wang Yaoting who stood in awe of justice and insisted on fighting in the prisons and courts of the Brazilian reactionaries, and four comrades such as Zhou Qinwen who were brave and unyielding in the face of beatings and threats from the reactionaries in Ghana. Now, the heroic deeds of Zhao Xiaoshou and his comrades-in-arms have emerged. All this shows that people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can have the revolutionary determination and noble revolutionary sentiments of the proletariat. Such people can overwhelm all enemies in the storms of class struggle at home and abroad, and will never be overwhelmed by any enemy. The great Chinese people, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible.
    The anti-violence struggle of the personnel of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia is by no means isolated. They have the strong backing of 650 million people of the motherland. In Indonesia, it is only a handful of reactionaries who are anti-China, and the broad masses of people are friendly to the Chinese people. The broad masses of overseas Chinese love the motherland and have their hearts set on the motherland. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out: "Our cause is just. A just cause cannot be broken by any enemy." The more frantically the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces oppose China, the more they expose their ugly faces, and the more they accelerate their failure. The law of the development of things must be like this.

### 头可断，血可流，祖国尊严不可侮

    头可断，血可流，祖国尊严不可侮
    这些天来，全中国人民都关切地注视着我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的同志们同印度尼西亚右派反动势力进行的英勇斗争。他们高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，不畏强暴，不怕牺牲，敢于赤手空拳抵抗印度尼西亚法西斯暴徒的野蛮袭击。他们不惜用自己的生命和鲜血，保卫祖国的尊严，保卫五星红旗。赵小寿同志因为保护我国国旗不受印度尼西亚法西斯暴徒侮辱而光荣负伤。现在，赵小寿同志和一部分参加这一场斗争的同志们，已经回到了祖国的怀抱。我们谨向我国外交战线上的英勇战士赵小寿同志和我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的其他同志们，致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问！
    赵小寿同志和我国驻印度尼西亚使馆全体同志的英勇事迹，充分地表现了中国人民大无畏的英雄气概。他们忠于革命，忠于祖国，坚贞不屈，临危不惧。他们面对着强暴，在众寡悬殊的情况下，仍然坚守岗位，英勇斗争。头可断，血可流，祖国和人民的尊严决不可侮！他们是真正的无产阶级硬骨头。
      赵小寿同志和他的战友们的英勇事迹，充分地体现了中国人民的集体主义的革命精神。在同印度尼西亚右派法西斯暴徒的搏斗中，中国大使馆是一个坚不可摧的战斗的集体。他们发扬了高度的阶级友爱精神，互相关心，互相支援，互相鼓舞，坚持斗争。他们在反革命暴力面前团结得象一个人一样。赵小寿正是在最紧急的关头，挺身而出，为了掩护自己的同志，保卫国旗，而遭到印度尼西亚反动军人的射击。这是无产阶级的革命英雄主义精神。
    赵小寿同志和我国驻印度尼西亚使馆全体人员的英勇事迹，充分地显示了中国人民横眉冷对世界上一切妖魔鬼怪，敢于蔑视帝国主义和一切反动派的革命精神。赵小寿同志和他的战友们，以自己的英雄气概，大煞印度尼西亚右派势力的威风，打击了帝国主义和一切反动派的气焰。他们不仅为中国人民树立了一个光辉的榜样，而且大长世界革命人民的志气，对于斗争中的各国革命人民是一个极大的鼓舞。
    在我国的外交战线上，出现赵小寿这样的英雄人物，决不是偶然的。他们是在毛泽东思想的长期哺育下，在党的长期关怀和教育下成长起来的。赵小寿同志一贯坚持学习毛泽东同志的著作，活学活用毛泽东思想，把毛主席的书当作最高指示，建立起无产阶级的世界观，全心全意为中国人民服务，为世界人民服务。正是因为毛泽东思想在自己的头脑里深深地扎下了根，赵小寿同志才从一个普通的青年，成长为一个具有崇高革命品质和高度革命觉悟的无产阶级战士。
      “春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧。”这是伟大的毛泽东时代中国人民英雄辈出的生动写照。在国内的各条战线上，不断地涌现出雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得和焦裕禄式的英雄模范人物。在外事工作方面，也曾经出现象王耀庭等九位同志在巴西反动派的监狱里和法庭上大义凛然、坚持斗争，象周勤文等四位同志在加纳面对反动派的殴打、威胁而英勇不屈的事例。现在，又出现了赵小寿和他的战友们的英勇事迹。所有这些都说明，用毛泽东思想武装起来的人，就能具有无产阶级的革命坚定性和高尚的革命情操。这样的人在国内外阶级斗争的风浪中，能够压倒一切敌人，而决不会被任何敌人所压倒。在毛泽东思想哺育下的伟大的中国人民，是不可战胜的。
    中国驻印度尼西亚使馆人员的抗暴斗争，决不是孤立的。他们有着六亿五千万祖国人民的强大后盾。在印度尼西亚，反华的只不过是一小撮反动派，广大人民是同中国人民友好的。广大华侨，是热爱祖国、心向祖国的。毛泽东同志指出：“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”印度尼西亚右派反动势力越是猖狂地反华，越是暴露它们的丑恶嘴脸，越是加速它们的失败。事物发展的规律，必然是如此。
