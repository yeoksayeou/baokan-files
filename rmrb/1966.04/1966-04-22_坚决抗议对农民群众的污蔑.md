    Resolutely Protest Against the Slander of the Peasant Masses 	Liu Xinglong, Guo Qian, Wang Kaishan
    Summary: China's peasants possess a strong revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit. Wu Han has consistently stood on the side of the landlord class, beautifying emperors, kings, generals, and ministers while defaming the peasant masses. Before liberation, he reviled peasant uprising armies as "bandits," "rioters," "rabble," and "thieves"; after liberation, he nonsensically claimed that emphasizing peasant uprisings meant making history "pitch black, dull and gray." We are the sons of poor and lower-middle peasants and resolutely protest Wu Han's slander of the peasant masses.
    Before liberation, Comrade Wu Han presented himself as a "democratic fighter." In 1961, to achieve his goals of opposing the Party and socialism, he again disguised himself as a "hero" who "spoke up for the people." But after reading most of Wu Han's works from before and after liberation, we cannot help but be filled with anger! It turns out that Wu Han is so vicious, slandering the peasant masses as utterly worthless, practically unforgivable. Therefore, as sons of poor and lower-middle peasants, university students of the socialist era, we have an obligation to tell poor and lower-middle peasants across the country what this anti-Party and anti-socialist element, waving the banner of "People's Representative," has slandered them with!
    Before Liberation, He Reviled the Peasant Masses, Opposed Peasant Wars, and Served Chiang Kai-shek's Reactionary Rule by Discrediting the Revolutionary Nature of Peasants, Falsely Claiming that Peasants Voluntarily Became Slaves to the Ruling Class, and that the Peasant Character was One of "Enduring and Slinking By"
    Chairman Mao said: "The Chinese people cannot tolerate the rule of dark forces, and they have always used revolutionary means to overthrow and transform this rule." To find a legitimate basis for the landlord class's exploitation of the peasants, Wu Han said, no! "Peasants are the most patient and docile," and they can "voluntarily" be slaves to the ruling class. In his article "The Peasantry of the Ming Dynasty," written in 1935, he also said that the "virtue" of peasants is being "the most docile, most willing to fulfill their responsibilities to the state." In the article "Society of the Yuan Dynasty," published in the same year, he finally found a piece of "historical evidence" in the old papers. He said, "According to the records in the Yuan Shi Shizu Ji, Cheng Zong Ji, and Xing Fa Zhi," some peasants, in order to "seek refuge" with aristocrats and landlords to "preserve their lives or avoid corvée labor," "voluntarily became slaves." Based on the "virtue" of peasants being "the most docile, most willing to fulfill their responsibilities to the state," and the carefully searched "historical evidence," Wu Han, in his article "The Collapse of the Yuan Empire and the Establishment of the Ming," written in 1936, explicitly stated that bearing "the vast majority of the state's corvée labor" was the peasants' "own obligations," and "in addition to their own obligations and taxes, they should also fulfill part of the responsibilities for the aristocrats and landlords." That is to say, peasants have the obligation to be beasts of burden for the ruling class. In a word, it is only right and proper for the ruling class to exploit the people, and it is only natural for the peasant masses to be beasts of burden! This is Wu Han's reactionary logic.
    For the needs of his class, Wu Han went to great lengths to discredit the revolutionary nature of the peasants, saying that peasants are a bunch of "brainless," "unambitious" characters, "besides farming and having strength," they understand nothing else, and their "only hope is to live in peace." Living is a peasant's "duty," and "suffering is also a duty." Their "best virtue" is "enduring and slinking by." How far this is from the class nature of the poor and lower-middle peasants and from the image of the poor and lower-middle peasants that we see today in socialist revolution and socialist construction! Chairman Mao said that poor peasants are the most revolutionary and are "revolutionary vanguards." But Wu Han insisted that the peasant masses are not only able to "endure" but also have a nature of "slinking by." We do not know, how can ordinary people, who have been squeezed dry of oil from their bones by the feudal ruling class, "slink by"? Is it like Wu Han's family, relying on "dozens of silver dollars a month in salary"? Relying on "nearly thirty mu of paddy fields"? Relying on "a tiled house" that "can collect five or six thousand catties of grain rent every year"? According to the experiences of our fathers and brothers, and according to what we have seen and heard in participating in the Socialist Education Movement in rural areas, we only know that every poor and lower-middle peasant who came out of the old society has a tragic history of blood and tears. Accompanying their sweat being exhausted and blood being squeezed dry, each also has an epic struggle history worthy of singing and weeping. They never resemble what Wu Han said in his article "The Era of the Writing of 'Jin Ping Mei' and Its Social Background," that "peasants are willing" to be "oppressed" and "protected" by landlords, how vile! He also said that if peasants "cannot even get this protection," the "result can only be escape and becoming vagrants." As if the peasants who get these "protections," their reason for having a glimmer of "survival" is because the poor people benefited from the rich people's glory. But every poor and lower-middle peasant who has tasted the bitterness of the old society knows what it is like to carry a burden for the landlord, and what it is like to be a maid for the landlord! It can be seen how absurd Wu Han's old-fashioned tone, which ignores historical facts and stands on the side of the landlord class, is!
    As mentioned above, Wu Han said in his article "Novels in History" that besides the "virtue" of "enduring and slinking by," the only hope of peasants is to live in peace. Based on the religious color of peasant uprisings, he said that "peasants are not very capable of understanding the meaning of political revolution." As long as there are teachings on how to have a good life, the peasants will "naturally believe with all their heart and join together to pursue this ideal paradise." It's as if the peasant masses are as profit-seeking as the exploiting classes, thinking about getting rich all day long, and becoming money-grubbers. He also slandered in the article "The Collapse of the Yuan Empire and the Establishment of the Ming" that to get peasants "to participate in the revolution, some religious or superstitious camouflage" must be added to attract them.
    Although Wu Han said that peasants' "greatest hope is to live in peace," and also said that peasants' "best virtue" is "enduring and slinking by," however, due to the ruling class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression, peasants have never had "peaceful days" and will not have peaceful days. Wu Han's "praise" of peasants' "good" virtue of "enduring and slinking by" cannot be eaten to fill hunger or worn to keep warm; they still have to struggle and still have to resist. But Wu Han came up with a void and conceptual theory to comfort the peasants. This is his vigorous praise of so-called "incorruptible officials," "good officials," "Bao Longtu," and "Hai Qingtians," and slandering the peasants as "liking" "incorruptible officials," "good officials," and "loving" "Bao Longtu" and "Hai Qingtians." In his article "Novels in History," Wu Han said: "The common people," "once they encounter unfortunate things, when they have no choice but to file a lawsuit, they need an incorruptible official like Bao Longtu who can be clear about right and wrong and clearly judge the case. As long as they are not wronged or suffer losses, they will be satisfied and willing for this good official to never leave." Peasants in Wu Han's writing are so passive and inactive, without any revolutionary spirit of struggle. Their only role is to kneel down, file a complaint to "Bao Longtu" and "Hai Qingtian," beg the enlightened officials to redress their grievances, and see the "incorruptible official" as their savior. Besides showing that Wu Han is a filial son and virtuous grandson of the landlord class, and acts as a mouthpiece for the feudal ruling class, what else can it show? The peasant masses will never believe in any "incorruptible official," because they have suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression, and the officials they have encountered, whether feudal or bourgeois, whether their surnames are Zhang or Li, have drawn such a truth from their own painful experiences: "All crows under the sky are equally black." To be liberated and to have freedom, we must rise up and fight.
    Viciously Slandering Peasant Uprisings, Serving Chiang Kai-shek's Rule with Hidden Intentions
    In order to cooperate with Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary activities attempting to eliminate the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, Wu Han, in a series of his works, viciously slandered and attacked peasant uprisings.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The landlord class's cruel economic exploitation and political oppression of the peasants has forced the peasants to repeatedly launch uprisings to resist the rule of the landlord class." The reason why peasants want to revolt and make revolution is entirely forced by those black-hearted ghosts—the landlords, rich men, and evil officials—who suck the peasants' blood and eat their flesh, entirely created by the man-eating old system. But Wu Han does not agree, in his article "The Collapse of the Yuan Empire and the Establishment of the Ming," written in 1937, he said that peasant uprisings are caused by the population "rapidly increasing and the land not being enough to distribute." From this absurd logic, it can be seen how distinct Wu Han's landlord class nature is! He is afraid that people will say that the peasant uprisings were forced by their ancestors.
    In a situation where the peasants could not bear it and had nowhere to retreat, in order to seek light, they rose up in revolt, like a storm, sweeping across the feudal ruling class, turning the new and old hatreds accumulated in their hearts into power at once. Wherever they went, they burned government offices, killed officials, opened granaries, and knocked down the landlord class. We say that this kind of action by peasants is "very good!" But Wu Han felt deeply disgusted, and in many works, he reviled the peasant uprising army as "bandits," "rioters," "rabble," "rebellion," "thieves," "robbers," "bandits," and their leaders as "rabble leaders" and "ambitious men." In 1934, it was precisely the period when the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army began the Long March, in order to provide Chiang Kai-shek with "bandit suppression" experience from history, Wu Han wrote the article "The Social Background of the Late Ming 'Bandits'." He said that the lesson of the late Ming Dynasty is that "the rulers at that time" were careless, treating the peasant uprising as a "minor ailment," "sleeping soundly," and never expected that the peasant uprising army, "once it had power," would actually come to "seize political power." Based on these experiences and lessons, he put forward two ways to deal with peasant uprisings: one is that in this "burning eyebrows" situation, the ruling group must "unite" and not "calculate each other with mutual suspicion." The other is to implement "appeasement" to fundamentally block the "source of chaos" to avoid "digging their own graves." From this, it can be seen Wu Han's deep-seated hatred of peasant uprisings and his psychology towards the peasant revolution under the leadership of the Communist Party.
    The peasant uprising killed some officials, drove away the landlords, and divided up some land, but Wu Han could not stand this especially. In "Biography of Zhu Yuanzhang," he wrote the peasant army as even more vicious than the official army. He said: "After the Red Army broke through the city, the generals robbed a lot, and then captured all the men and women in the city, causing the people to be separated from their wives and children, and their families were ruined." The insurgent army "killed, set fires, raped, robbed, and opposed the people, losing all conscience," making the people "really unable to live." He also slandered that the inside of the insurgent army was a chaotic mess and could not be successful. In "Biography of Zhu Yuanzhang," he said: "Haozhou has five marshals, standing shoulder to shoulder, without brains, no one obeys anyone, no one can dispatch anyone, making a chaotic mess, without any proper system," "without great ambition, it will not be successful."
    Later, in "The Art of Governance of Zhu Yuanzhang," he also viciously slandered the motives of the peasant uprising, saying that the peasants "fought hard for more than ten years, what was it for? It was nothing more than to be a high official, to be granted a high rank, to seal wives and protect sons, big estates, good servants, countless gold and silver coins, and endless brocade silk, to live a glorious, decent, and comfortable life."
    Peasant uprisings and peasant wars are the real driving force of the development of Chinese feudal society, this Marxist-Leninist principle is even more firmly opposed by Wu Han. In his 1934 article "The Social Background of the Late Ming 'Bandits'," he said nakedly: The demise of the Ming Dynasty, "rather than saying this is the merit of the bandits, it is more appropriate to say this is the natural collapse of the ancient social and economic system." According to Wu Han's statement, any ruling class can "naturally collapse." But, up to now, no ruling class and no ruler in Chinese and foreign history has rolled out of the historical stage due to "natural collapse." Without Li Zicheng marching into Beijing, the Chongzhen Emperor would not have hanged himself; without the Chinese People's Liberation Army occupying the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, Chiang Kai-shek's blue sky and white sun flag would not have been trampled underfoot by the people! As Chairman Mao said: "Anything reactionary, if you don't hit it, it won't fall." Therefore, Wu Han's reactionary preaching is unconvincing, and his scolding and his series of fallacies are extremely absurd and ridiculous.
    Thousands of years of feudal society have passed, and decades of Kuomintang rule have also passed. We revolutionary people have always been accustomed to being scolded by the reactionary ruling class. But how can scolding stop the wheels of history, and how can saliva drown the rising sun! The revolution has finally succeeded, and hundreds of millions of working people have finally stood up. Of course, in this era where these monsters and demons have not yet been completely eradicated, we will always hear scolding at all times.

      After Liberation, he Uglyfied the Peasant Masses, Opposed Peasant Wars, Beautified Emperors, Kings, Generals, and Ministers, and Served the Restoration of Feudalism and Capitalism	   Reactionary Views　Remain Unchanged
    Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people, after decades of bloody battles, finally overthrew the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, and all the working people of China came out of the sea of ​​suffering and saw the blue sky. Wu Han harbored deep-seated hatred for the victory of the people, and was thinking about changing the world all the time. After liberation, Wu Han, in a series of his works, stubbornly adhered to the reactionary views before liberation, and between the lines permeated his hatred for the peasant masses and the victory of the people. In 1962, in his article "Several Questions on Learning Historical Knowledge," he scolded peasants "from poor and hired peasant origins" as having "no achievements in their lives." Writing these "penniless" people in history would taint history and make history lose its glory. In his view, only the emperors, prime ministers, generals, and "incorruptible officials" of the landlord class, those who made "contributions" to history, only Tang Taizong, Zhu Yuanzhang, and Hai Rui, are qualified to be written in history and will add glory to history. Otherwise, it is "canceling history." He deeply hated peasant uprisings. In 1961, in his article "Several Questions in Historical Teaching Materials and Historical Research," he was deeply dissatisfied with many history textbooks "emphasizing peasant uprisings and peasant wars," and nonsensically said that "what is written in the books is all about how bad this dynasty is, how the peasant uprising overthrew it, how another dynasty rose, how bad it is, and how the peasant uprising overthrew it again, a series of overthrows, history has almost become pitch black, dull and gray." In his view, it is rebellious and dark for peasant uprisings to overthrow the feudal dynasty; only the bloody rule of the landlord class over the peasants is the light in history. In today's world, when the landlord class has been overthrown and the people are in charge, his praise of emperors, kings, generals, and ministers and his promotion of feudal poisons are aimed at summoning the souls of the feudal landlord class, uglifying the socialist system, and setting off a black wind of feudalism and capitalist restoration.
    Slandering the Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants, Opposing the Party, Socialism, and Communization in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"
    In 1959, right-wing opportunists launched a frenzied attack on the Party and were kicked out of the historical stage by the people. Wu Han was reluctant to part with the right-wing opportunists who were "dismissed" from "office" by the Party and the people, so he "broke out of the house" and wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Hai Rui in the play is the incarnation of right-wing opportunists, that is, Wu Han himself. Here, the banner Wu Han is waving is "speaking up for the people," and he is doing his best to dress up his gang as "heroes" who "speak up for the people." Wu Han tried to make people believe that his "speaking up for the people" is "speaking up" for the poor and lower-middle peasants; his opposition to rural officials and land restitution represents the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants and is thinking of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Therefore, he sang loudly in the play the tunes of "The South of the Yangtze River is in a state of misery and desolation; the occupation of land will not last long if it is not returned" and "The grievances of unjust cases must be redressed; the restitution of land can bring peace to the people." In his view, the poor and lower-middle peasants in our country were asking for land restitution and opposing grassroots cadres during the difficult years of the past few years. Is the fact really as Wu Han said? Wrong, completely wrong. The vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants in our country were saved from the sea of ​​suffering by the Party and Chairman Mao, and they have a close blood relationship with the Party. They will never forget who their benefactor is at any time, not only will they not forget themselves, but they will also tell these to his sons and grandsons, so that their descendants will not forget. During the difficult times of the country in the past few years, it was precisely the poor and lower-middle peasants and the grassroots cadres of the Party who united and worked together with one heart and one mind to defeat the frenzied attacks of the monsters and demons and adhere to the road of communization. But Wu Han completely ignored these facts. In order to achieve his anti-Party and anti-socialist goals, he had to force the peasants to shout out the anti-Party and anti-socialist voices of their right-wing opportunists. To talk about the slander of the peasant masses, this is the biggest slander.
    Now, we clearly realize that whether it is the past Wu Han or the present Wu Han, they both hate the peasant masses, especially the vast number of poor and lower-middle peasants. He has made the greatest uglification and slander of the peasant masses. While eating the grain produced by the peasant masses coming from the wind and rain, with a handful of sweat and a handful of mud, he viciously cursed the peasants.
    The three of us are all sons of poor and lower-middle peasants, we cannot tolerate Wu Han's vicious slander of the peasants, and we cannot tolerate his crazy attacks on the Party and socialism. We must thoroughly criticize his reactionary position and thought.

### 坚决抗议对农民群众的污蔑

    坚决抗议对农民群众的污蔑	刘兴隆　郭乾　王开山
    提　要　我国农民富有坚强的革命性和斗争性。吴晗一贯站在地主阶级立场上，美化帝王将相，诋毁农民群众。解放前，他辱骂农民起义军是“流寇”、“乱民”、“暴民”、“盗贼”；解放后，他胡说强调农民起义，就是把历史弄得“漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”。我们是贫下中农的儿子，坚决抗议吴晗对农民群众的污蔑。
    在解放前，吴晗同志以“民主斗士”自居。一九六一年，为了达到反党反社会主义的目的，他又把自己打扮成一个“为民请命”的“英雄”。但我们读了吴晗解放前后的大部分著作以后，不禁满腔怒火！原来，吴晗是这样的恶毒，把农民群众污蔑得一无是处，简直是十恶不赦。因此，我们作为贫下中农的儿子，社会主义时代的大学生，有义务告诉全国贫下中农，让他们知道，这个打着“人民代表”旗号的反党反社会主义分子，都污蔑了他们一些什么！
    解放前，辱骂农民群众，反对农民战争，为蒋介石的反动统治服务诋毁农民的革命性，胡说农民为统治阶级当奴隶出于“自愿”，农民的性格是“忍耐苟安”
    毛主席说：“中国人民是不能忍受黑暗势力的统治的，他们每次都用革命的手段达到推翻和改造这种统治的目的。”为了替地主阶级对农民的剥削找合法根据，吴晗却说，不！“农民是最能忍耐最驯服的”，他们可以“自愿”为统治阶级当奴才的。他在一九三五年写的《明代之农民》一文中还说，农民的“美德”是“最驯良，最肯对国家尽责任”。在同年发表的《元代之社会》一文中，他从故纸堆里终于找到了一条“历史根据”。他说，“据元史世祖纪，成宗纪及刑法志的记载”，有一些农民，他们为了“投靠”贵族、地主以“保全生命或避免徭役”，因而“自愿为奴”。基于农民“最驯良，最肯对国家尽责任”的“德性”和精心搜寻的“历史根据”，吴晗在一九三六年写的《元帝国之崩溃与明之建国》一文中，明确地规定：负担“国家赋役的绝大部分”是农民“自己应尽的义务”，并且“除他们自己应尽的义务和应纳的赋税以外，他们还应当替贵族和地主们尽一部分责任”。这就是说，农民有义务替统治阶级做牛做马。一句话，统治阶级剥削人民天经地义，农民群众做牛做马理所当然！这就是吴晗的反动逻辑。
    吴晗为了本阶级的需要，极力诋毁农民的革命性，说农民是一堆“没头脑”、“没大出息”的人物，“除了种庄稼，有力气以外”，别的什么都不懂，他们“唯一的希望是过平安日子”。活着是农民的“本分”，“吃苦也是本分”。他们“最好的德性”，就是“忍耐苟安”。这和贫下中农的阶级性，和我们今天所看到的在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中贫下中农的形象是相距多远啊！毛主席说，贫农最革命，他们是“革命先锋”。但是，吴晗却偏偏要说农民群众不但能够“忍耐”，而且还有一种“苟安”的本性。我们不知道，被封建统治阶级从骨头里榨出油来的老百姓，他们凭什么“苟安”呢？是象吴晗的家里一样，凭“一个月有几十元银元薪水”吗？凭“近三十亩左右的水田”吗？凭“一所瓦房”，“每年可以收五六千斤谷子的租子”吗？按照我们父兄的经历，按照我们在农村参加社会主义教育运动中的所见所闻，我们只知道每一个从旧社会出来的贫下中农，都有着一部悲惨的血泪史。伴随着他们的汗流尽，血榨干，也各有着一部悲壮的可歌可泣的斗争史。他们从来不象吴晗在《金瓶梅的著作时代及其社会背景》一文中说的，“农民甘心”受地主的“压迫”和“庇荫”那样下流！他还说，农民“连这庇荫也不能得到”的话，“结果只能逃亡，变成流民”。好象得到这些“庇荫”的农民，他们之所以有一线“生路”，是穷人沾了富人的光。但每一个饱尝过旧社会辛酸的贫下中农，都知道给地主扛活的滋味是什么，给地主当丫头的滋味又是什么！可见吴晗这种无视历史事实，站在地主阶级立场上的老爷式口气是何等荒谬绝伦！
    上面已经说了，吴晗在《历史中的小说》一文里说，农民除了“忍耐苟安”的“德性”以外，唯一的希望是过平安日子。他以农民起义所带的宗教色彩为据，说“农民是不很能了解政治革命的意义的”。只要有关于如何有好日子过的说教，农民便“自然死心踏地的信仰，一致加入去追求这理想的乐园”。好象农民群众也象剥削阶级一样，唯利是图，整天价想着发财，成了财迷了。他还在《元帝国之崩溃与明之建国》一文中污蔑说，要农民“来参加革命，也非加上一些宗教的或迷信色彩的外障”来吸引他们不可。
    尽管吴晗说农民“最大的希望是过平安的日子”，也说农民“最好的德性”就是“忍耐苟安”，但是，由于统治阶级残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，农民始终不曾有过“平安的日子”过，也不会有平安日子过。吴晗对农民这种“忍耐苟安”的“好”德性的“夸奖”，也是不能当饭以充饥，当衣以御寒的，他们仍要斗争，仍要反抗的。但吴晗又拿出了一种虚无的、概念式的理论来安慰农民了。这就是他竭力吹捧所谓“清官”、“好官”“包龙图”、“海青天”，并污蔑农民“喜欢”“清官”、“好官”，“热爱”“包龙图”、“海青天”。他在《历史中的小说》一文里说：“老百姓”“一遭了不幸的事，非打官司不可的时候，他们需要一个象包龙图那样的清官，能一是一、二是二，把案子断清楚。只要不受冤，不吃亏，也就心满意足，愿意这好官永远不离开”。在吴晗笔下的农民就是这样的消极无为，没有一点革命斗争精神。他们唯一的作用就是跪下来，向“包龙图”、“海青天”告状，哀求青天大老爷为他们伸冤作主，把“清官”看作是自己的救世主。这除了说明吴晗是地主阶级的孝子贤孙，替封建统治阶级充当喉舌以外，又能说明什么呢？农民群众是决然不会相信有什么“清官”的，因为他们受尽了剥削，受尽了压迫，他们所遇见的官吏，不管是封建的，资产阶级的，也不管是姓张姓李，他们从自己惨痛的经历中得出这样一条真理：“天下乌鸦一般黑”。要解放，要自由，必须起来斗争。
    恶毒地污蔑农民起义，含沙射影替蒋介石统治服务
    为了配合蒋介石企图消灭工农红军的反革命活动，吴晗在自己的一系列著作中，对农民起义进行了恶毒的污蔑和攻击。
    毛泽东同志说：“地主阶级对于农民的残酷的经济剥削和政治压迫，迫使农民多次地举行起义，以反抗地主阶级的统治。”农民之所以要起义，要革命，完全是地主老财、乡官恶吏这些吸农民的血、吃农民的肉的黑心鬼逼出来的，完全是吃人的旧制度造成的。但吴晗却不以为然，他在一九三七年写的《元帝国之崩溃与明之建国》一文中，说农民起义是由于人口“飞快地增加，土地又不够分配”所引起的。从这个荒谬的逻辑里，可以看出吴晗的地主阶级本性是多么鲜明！唯恐人们说农民起义是他们的老祖宗逼出来的。
    农民在忍无可忍、退无可退的境地，为了寻求光明，于是便揭竿而起，象暴风雨一样，横扫封建统治阶级，把他们平日积压在心头的新仇旧恨一下子化成力量。他们所到之处，烧官府，杀官吏，开粮仓，把地主阶级打翻在地。农民的这种举动，我们说“好得很！”但吴晗却感到深恶痛绝，他在许多著作中，辱骂农民起义军是“流寇”、“乱民”、“暴民”、“叛乱”，是“盗”、“贼”、“匪”、“寇”，他们的领袖是“暴民领袖”，是“野心家”。一九三四年，正是工农红军开始长征时期，为了从历史上替蒋介石提供“剿共”经验，吴晗写了《晚明“流寇”之社会背景》一文。他说，明末的教训是“当时的统治者”大意了，把农民起义看成是“疥癣之疾”，“高枕而卧”，料想不到农民起义军“一有了势力”，竟来“夺取政权”。他根据这些经验教训，提出了两条对付农民起义的办法：一条是，在这种“火烧眉睫的时候”，统治集团要“联合起来”，不要“勾心斗角地互相计量”。另一条是，施行“抚恤”，从根本上堵死“致乱之源”，以免“自掘坟墓”。从这里可以看出，吴晗对农民起义所怀的刻骨仇恨，和对在共产党领导之下的农民革命的心理了。
    农民起义杀了一些官吏，赶跑了地主，分得了一些土地，但吴晗对这特别看不下去。在《朱元璋传》里，他把农民军写得比官军还凶恶。他说：“红军攻破城池，各将领大抢一顿以后，又把满城男妇虏获，闹得老百姓妻离子散，家破人亡”。起义军“杀人放火，奸淫抢劫和人民作对，失尽了良心”，使老百姓“实在没法子活下去”。他还污蔑起义军内部是乱哄哄的一团糟，成不了事。在《朱元璋传》里，他说：“濠州有五个元帅，一字并肩，没有头脑，谁也不服谁，谁也支使不了谁，闹得乱烘烘，不成个体统”，“没有大出息，成不了事”。
    后来，他在《朱元璋的统治术》里，还恶毒污蔑农民起义的动机，说农民“苦战了十几年，为的是什么？无非是为作大官，拜大爵位，封妻荫子，大庄园，好奴仆，数不尽的金银钱钞，用不完的锦绮绸罗，风风光光，体体面面，舒舒服服的过日子”。
    农民起义、农民战争是中国封建社会历史发展的真正动力，这个马克思列宁主义的原理，更是吴晗所坚决反对的。他在一九三四年《晚明“流寇”之社会背景》一文中，赤裸裸地说：明王朝的灭亡，“与其说这是流寇的功绩，还不如说这是古老的社会，经济制度的自然崩溃为比较妥当”。按照吴晗的这种说法，任何统治阶级都是可以“自然崩溃”的。但是，迄今为止，中外历史上还没有一个统治阶级，也没有一个统治者是由于“自然崩溃”而滚出历史舞台的。没有李自成进军北京，崇祯皇帝是不会上吊的；没有中国人民解放军占领南京总统府，蒋介石的青天白日旗是不会被人民踩在脚底下的！正象毛主席所说的：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒”。所以吴晗的反动说教是无法令人信服的，他的辱骂和他的一系列谬论也是极其荒唐可笑的。
    几千年的封建社会过去了，几十年的国民党统治也过去了，我们革命人民一向是被反动统治阶级骂惯了的。但是，辱骂怎能挡住历史的车轮，唾沫星又怎能淹没旭日东升的光辉！革命毕竟成功了，千千万万的劳动大众也毕竟站起来了。当然，在这些牛鬼蛇神还没有根本绝迹的时代里，我们时时刻刻还会听到辱骂的。
      解放后，丑化农民群众，反对农民战争，美化帝王将相，为封建主义、资本主义的复辟效劳	   反动观点　分毫未变
    在党和毛主席的英明领导下，中国人民经过几十年的浴血奋战，终于推翻了国民党的反动统治，全中国劳动人民出了苦海，见了青天。吴晗对人民的胜利怀着刻骨的仇恨，无时无刻不在想着变天。解放后，吴晗在他的一系列著作中，顽固地坚持解放前的反动观点，字里行间都渗透着他对农民群众、对人民胜利的仇恨。一九六二年，他在《学习历史知识的几个问题》一文中，辱骂“贫雇农出身”的农民，“一辈子没有什么成就”。把这些“一无所有”的人写在历史上，就会沾污历史，就会使历史失去光辉。在他看来，只有地主阶级的皇帝、宰相、将军、“清官”，这些对历史有“贡献”的人物，只有唐太宗、朱元璋、海瑞，才有资格写在历史上，才会使历史增添光辉。否则，就是“取消历史”。他对农民起义深恶痛绝。一九六一年，他在《历史教材和历史研究中的几个问题》一文中，对许多历史教材“强调农民起义、农民战争”深为不满，胡说什么“写在书上的尽是这个皇朝如何坏，农民起义推翻了它，另一个皇朝起来了，又如何坏，农民起义又推翻了它，一片打倒声，历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的”。在他看来，农民起义打倒封建王朝，是大逆不道，是造反，是黑暗；只有地主阶级对农民的血腥统治，才是历史上的光明。在地主阶级被打倒在地，人民当家作主的今天，他歌颂帝王将相，宣扬封建主义毒素，其目的就是在为封建地主阶级招魂，就是为了丑化社会主义制度，就是为了刮起一场封建主义、资本主义复辟的黑风。
    在《海瑞罢官》中污蔑贫下中农，反党、反社会主义、反公社化
    一九五九年，右倾机会主义分子向党猖狂进攻，被人民踢出历史舞台。吴晗对被党和人民“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子依依不舍，于是“破门而出”，写出了《海瑞罢官》。剧中的海瑞，正是右倾机会主义分子的化身，也就是吴晗自己的化身。在这里，吴晗打的旗号是“为民请命”，他竭力把自己一伙人装扮成一个“强哉矫”的“为民请命”的“英雄”。吴晗妄图使人相信，他“为民请命”，就是为贫下中农“请命”；他反乡官、搞退田，就是代表贫下中农的利益的，为贫下中农着想。因而，他在剧本中大唱特唱“江南困苦凄凉相，不退占田不久长”，“冤狱重重要平反，退田方能使民安”的调子。在他看来，我国贫下中农在前几年困难时期是要求退田和反对基层干部的。事实果真象吴晗所说的那样吗？错了，完全错了。我国广大的贫下中农，都是党和毛主席从苦海里救出来的，他们与党有着亲密的血肉关系，他们任何时候都不会忘记他们的恩人是谁，不但他们自己不会忘，而且他们还把这些告诉他的儿子、孙子，要他们的后世都不要忘。在前几年国家困难时期，正是贫下中农和党的基层干部团结一致，同心同德，才打退了牛鬼蛇神的猖狂进攻，坚持了公社化的道路。但是，吴晗却根本无视这些事实。为了达到他反党反社会主义的目的，他硬要强迫农民喊出他们右倾机会主义分子反党、反社会主义的心声。要说对农民群众的污蔑，这就是最大的污蔑。
    现在，我们清楚地认识到，无论是过去的吴晗，还是现在的吴晗，都是恨透了农民群众、特别是广大贫下中农的。他对农民群众作了最大的丑化和污蔑。他一边吃着农民群众风里来，雨里去，一把汗一把泥生产出来的粮食，一边恶毒地咒骂着农民。
    我们三个都是贫下中农的儿子，我们不能容忍吴晗对农民的恶毒的污蔑，我们更不能容忍他对党、对社会主义的疯狂进攻。我们要彻底批判他的反动立场和思想。
