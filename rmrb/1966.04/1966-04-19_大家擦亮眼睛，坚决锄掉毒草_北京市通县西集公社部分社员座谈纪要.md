　　Wang Juzeng's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" is a veiled attack on the Party Central Committee, and supports the right-leaning opportunists.

　　The newspaper's criticism of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is excellent. It is truly infuriating that Wu Han wrote such vile articles and plays.

　　Comrade Wu Han, through "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," insidiously compares the Communist Party, which wholeheartedly serves the people, to the "tyrant" of a feudal dynasty, vehemently scolding the Party Central Committee and socialism. That's why demons and monsters applauded!

　　"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" even more brazenly praises Hai Rui's fearlessness of losing his official position, engaging in "land return," and "pleading for the people." In fact, he was praising the right-leaning opportunists' advocacy of "San Zi Yi Bao" and opposition to collectivization, encouraging the right-leaning opportunists. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" also fabricated history, saying that Hai Rui's dismissal was met with sympathy and regret from the peasant masses. This lie is too shameful. The landlords would not and did not do good things for the peasants, and the peasants would never love the landlords. Comrade Wu Han fabricated this historical account to help the right-leaning opportunists, to support them, to tell them not to be discouraged, not to be afraid of failure, and to continue. It is absolutely correct to say that "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a major anti-Party, anti-socialist poisonous weed.

　　Chairman Mao has long told us that the enemies with guns have been eliminated, but the enemies without guns still exist, class struggle exists for a long time, and the class struggle in ideology is still sharp and complex. We must sharpen our eyes, or we will make big mistakes.

　　Feng Lu: Wu Han's support for right-leaning opportunists against collectivization is opposition to us poor and lower-middle peasants.

　　We poor and lower-middle peasants raise both hands in support of the criticism of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office."

　　Hai Rui was an official of the feudal landlord class and could not possibly "scold" the emperor. The opinions he offered to the emperor were also to consolidate feudal rule and perpetually exploit the blood and sweat of the peasants. Hai Rui feared the emperor being overthrown and advised the emperor to strengthen his rule while preserving his own life of exploitation, being an official, and acting like a master. Why did Hai Rui's "loyalty" to the emperor turn into "scolding" in Comrade Wu Han's hands? Wu Han wrote so much about "scolding" to support the right-leaning opportunists in scolding our beloved Party Central Committee and socialism, wanting them to scold even more fiercely. The right-leaning opportunists opposed collectivization, wanting to undermine our foundation, which we poor and lower-middle peasants will never allow. The people's commune is the guarantee of a happy life for us poor and lower-middle peasants. After collectivization, the output of our Zhao Village has more than doubled. Zhao Village has electric lights, steel mills, water pumps, crushers, chaff cutters… Production has greatly developed. We poor and lower-middle peasants have personally experienced the benefits of collectivization. Comrade Wu Han's support for right-leaning opportunists against collectivization is opposition to us poor and lower-middle peasants. We will fight him to the end.

　　Zheng Bingxiang: "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" support the right-leaning opportunists in carrying out capitalist restoration and are weapons for attacking the Party and socialism.

　　Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" must be thoroughly criticized.

　　Chairman Mao pointed out that literature and art should serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and praise the heroic figures of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Wu Han insisted on elevating a historically decadent figure, praising him greatly, his political purpose is extremely reactionary. In 1959, after we implemented collectivization, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements opposed collectivization and demanded "land return." The right-leaning opportunists also said that collectivization was done poorly and too early. They vehemently scolded the people's commune and our Party Central Committee. At that time, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" with ulterior motives, wasn't the "emperor" referring to our beloved Party Central Committee? In this bad article, Wu Han also said that the "scolding" was "extremely enjoyable." At that time, some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in our village also made trouble everywhere, scolding the Three Red Banners and our Party, dreaming of restoration. Comrade Wu Han said that the scolding was good, wasn't he standing on their side?

　　Wu Han's writing about Hai Rui is a matter of stance and a political issue. He is speaking for the right-leaning opportunists.

　　Yin Baoqing: Wu Han encouraged the landlord elements here to scold socialism and the Communist Party everywhere.

　　Hai Rui is a dead man from hundreds of years ago, why is he being brought out to be written about and performed so extensively today? We know that writing articles and performing plays are for educating people. Comrade Wu Han also repeatedly emphasized that writing plays is "using the past to serve the present," how is he using it?

　　Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," but in fact, Hai Rui never scolded the emperor, he only gave the emperor some suggestions, asking the emperor to suppress and rule the peasants well, aiming to consolidate the rule of the landlord masters. This shows that Hai Rui was a thoroughly reactionary fellow and an enemy of the people. Comrade Wu Han painstakingly praised Hai Rui, praised the non-existent "scolding," and commended the "scolding" as good and "enjoyable." June 1959 was precisely when the right-leaning opportunists were scolding our Party the most fiercely. At that time, some landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in our Xiji Commune were also very rampant. A landlord element in Lintun Brigade buried more than 2,000 jin of grain underground (which later all became moldy). He ran outside, shouting and yelling, saying there was nothing to eat, scolding everywhere. He vehemently scolded collectivization, scolded the cadres, and scolded our Party. When class enemies were attacking the Party and vehemently scolding the Party Central Committee, Comrade Wu Han wrote these articles to cheer on the right-leaning opportunists and these demons and monsters like the landlord element in Lintun. Isn't this very obvious?

　　Comrade Wu Han wants to deny the debt in his "self-criticism," this debt cannot be denied, it must be settled now.

　　Yin Dianxiang: Eating the people's food but singing a different tune from us poor and lower-middle peasants. Wu Han's tricks cannot deceive us poor and lower-middle peasants.

　　Seeing the criticism of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," I feel very happy.

　　I have seen the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and I felt very awkward and unpleasant at the time. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, I became clear-headed and saw it more clearly.

　　"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" praises an official from hundreds of years ago, saying that Hai Rui's land return made the peasants have "good days." How could there be such kind-hearted landlord bureaucrats? Wu Han fabricated this lie with ulterior motives. The play's saying that "land return" makes "peasants have good days" is precisely cheering for the right-leaning opportunists' opposition to collectivization. The play's saying that Hai Rui struggled so bravely is praising the right-leaning opportunists for being anti-Party and anti-socialist. The play sympathizes with Hai Rui's dismissal, which shows regret for the right-leaning opportunists' dismissal.

　　Wu Han is a national cadre, eating the people's food, and should serve socialism and us workers and peasants well. But on the contrary, he does not work for us but deviously sings a different tune from us poor and lower-middle peasants. He opposes the Party and socialism together with the right-leaning opportunists. The tricks he plays cannot deceive us poor and lower-middle peasants. We clearly see that he is not one of us.

    大家擦亮眼睛，坚决锄掉毒草
    北京市通县西集公社部分社员座谈纪要
    王巨增《海瑞骂皇帝》是含沙射影地骂党中央，为右倾机会主义分子撑腰。
    报纸上批判《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》，好得很。吴晗写了这么恶劣的文章和戏，真叫人气愤。
    吴晗同志通过《海瑞骂皇帝》含沙射影地把全心全意为人民服务的共产党比做封建王朝的“昏君”，大骂特骂党中央、社会主义。所以牛鬼蛇神拍手叫好！
    《海瑞罢官》更大肆赞扬海瑞不怕丢官，搞“退田”，“为民请命”。事实上他是在那里吹捧右倾机会主义分子主张“三自一包”，反对公社化，为右倾机会主义分子鼓劲。《海瑞罢官》还假造历史，说海瑞被罢官得到农民群众同情和惋惜。这个谎撒得太可耻了。地主阶级的老爷不会也没有给农民办好事，农民也决不会爱地主老爷。吴晗同志假造这段历史，是为了帮助右倾机会主义分子，为他们撑腰，叫他们不要泄气，不要怕失败，干下去。说《海瑞罢官》是反党反社会主义的大毒草，一点也不错。
    毛主席早就告诉我们，拿枪的敌人消灭了，不拿枪的敌人仍然存在，阶级斗争长期存在，意识形态上的阶级斗争仍是尖锐复杂的。我们要擦亮眼睛，要不就会犯大错误。
    冯路　吴晗支持右倾机会主义分子反对公社化，就是反对我们贫下中农。
    对《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》进行批判，我们贫下中农举双手赞成。
    海瑞是封建地主阶级的官吏，根本不可能“骂”皇帝。他给皇帝提些意见，也是为了巩固封建统治，长期剥削农民的血汗。海瑞是怕“皇上”被推翻，而劝“皇上”加强统治，同时保住自己的剥削生活，当官做老爷。海瑞对皇帝的“忠”为什么一到吴晗同志手里就变成“骂”了呢？吴晗大写“骂”，目的是用它来支持右倾机会主义分子骂我们敬爱的党中央、社会主义，要他们骂得厉害些。右倾机会主义分子反对公社化，是想挖我们的墙脚，我们贫下中农决不答应。人民公社是我们贫下中农幸福生活的保证。公社化以后，我们赵庄的产量提高了二倍多。赵庄有了电灯，有了钢磨、抽水机、粉碎机、铡草机……生产大大地向前发展了。我们贫下中农亲身体验到公社化的好处。吴晗同志支持右倾机会主义分子反对公社化，就是反对我们贫下中农。我们要和他斗争到底。
    郑炳相　《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》，是支持右倾机会主义分子搞资本主义复辟，是向党向社会主义进攻的武器。
    吴晗的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》必须彻底批判。
    毛主席指出文学艺术要为工农兵服务，歌颂工农兵的英雄人物。吴晗偏偏抬出一个历史上腐朽了的人物，大加颂扬，他的政治目的是十分反动的。一九五九年，在我们实现公社化后，地富反坏分子反对公社化，要求“退田”。右倾机会主义分子也说公社化搞糟了，搞早了。他们大骂人民公社，骂我们的党中央。那时候，吴晗同志别有用心地写出了《海瑞骂皇帝》，“皇帝”还不是指我们贫下中农敬爱的党中央。吴晗在这篇坏文章里还说“骂”得“非常之痛快”。那时我们村里一些地富反坏分子也到处捣乱，骂三面红旗，骂我们的党，梦想复辟。吴晗同志说骂得好，还不正是跟他们站在一边吗？
    吴晗写海瑞是立场问题、政治问题。他是替右倾机会主义分子说话。
    尹宝庆　吴晗鼓励了我们这里的地主分子到处大骂社会主义，大骂共产党。
    海瑞是几百年以前的死人，为什么今天要搬出来大写大演呢？我们知道，写文章、演戏是为了教育人。吴晗同志也一再强调写戏是“古为今用”，他是怎么用的呢？
    吴晗同志写《海瑞骂皇帝》，事实上海瑞根本没有骂过皇帝，只是给皇帝提些意见，要皇帝好好地镇压和统治农民，目的是为了巩固地主老爷们的统治。这正表明海瑞是一个反动透顶的家伙，是人民的敌人。吴晗同志却费尽心机来歌颂海瑞，歌颂无中生有的“骂”，称赞“骂”得好，“骂”得“痛快”。一九五九年六月，正是右倾机会主义分子骂我们党，骂得最厉害的时候。那时，我们西集公社有些地富反坏分子也很猖狂。林屯大队有一个地主分子，他把二千多斤粮食埋在地下（后来全发霉了）。跑到外面乱叫乱嚷，说没有吃的，到处骂大街。他大骂公社化，骂干部，骂我们的党。在阶级敌人向党进攻、大骂党中央的时候，吴晗同志写这些文章正是替右倾机会主义分子，替林屯这个地主分子这类牛鬼蛇神打气。这不是十分明显的吗？
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”里想赖账，这笔账赖不掉，现在要清算一下。
    尹殿香　吃着人民的饭，却和我们贫下中农唱对台戏。吴晗的鬼花样，是瞒不过我们贫下中农的。
    看到对《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》的批判，心里很痛快。
    《海瑞罢官》这出戏我看过，当时就觉得很别扭，不是味儿。通过学习毛主席著作，头脑清醒了，看得更清楚了。
    《海瑞罢官》歌颂几百年前的官老爷，说海瑞搞退田，使农民有“好日子过”。天下哪有这样善心的地主官僚？吴晗捏造这种谎话，是别有用心的。戏里说“退田”“农民有好日子过”，正是为右倾机会主义分子反对公社化叫好。戏里说海瑞多么勇敢地斗争，正是颂扬右倾机会主义者反党反社会主义。戏里同情海瑞被罢官，就是对右倾机会主义分子被免职感到惋惜。
    吴晗是国家的干部，吃着人民的饭，按理应该很好地为社会主义服务，为我们工人、贫下中农服务。但是相反，他不为我们办事，拐弯抹角地同我们贫下中农唱对台戏。他同右倾机会主义分子一起反党反社会主义。他耍的鬼花样，瞒不过我们贫农下中农。我们清楚地看到，他不是我们的人。
