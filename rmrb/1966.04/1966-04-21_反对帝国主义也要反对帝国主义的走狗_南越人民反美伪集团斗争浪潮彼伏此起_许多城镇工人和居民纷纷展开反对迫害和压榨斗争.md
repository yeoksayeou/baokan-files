    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 19th (Dispatch) According to the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency: Workers and residents in many cities in South Vietnam have recently launched continuous struggles against persecution and oppression by the U.S.-puppet clique.
    At the end of March, representatives of many trade union organizations in the Saigon and Gia Dinh areas held a meeting and decided to continue the struggle against the U.S.-puppet clique, demanding increased wages and lower prices.
    The meeting pointed out that the U.S. war of aggression against South Vietnam has destroyed South Vietnam's economy, caused prices to soar, brought difficulties to the supply of cities, and plunged the urban people into poverty and hunger.
    Approximately five hundred rubber workers in the Dau Tieng town of Thu Dau Mot province held a rally on March 24, strongly condemning the U.S.-puppet clique and rubber plantation owners for intensifying their exploitation of workers, making workers' lives increasingly impoverished. Prior to this, the workers of this rubber plantation had twice marched to Dau Tieng town on February 14 and March 3 to protest the U.S.-puppet clique's shelling of the rubber plantation, persecution of workers, and the rubber plantation owners' deductions from workers' rations and other criminal acts.
    In March, people in cities such as Gia Dinh, Tay Ninh, and Bac Lieu successively launched struggles against the U.S.-puppet clique's atrocities of demolishing houses and forced relocation.
    On March 21, more than two hundred residents of Phu Nhuan Street in Gia Dinh City rushed to the puppet street district office to protest the U.S.-puppet clique's attempt to open a road for U.S. military vehicles to enter and exit Tan Son Nhut Airport. On the 23rd, the masses of this street also poured into the Gia Dinh province puppet regime office and the puppet provincial governor's residence to carry out the struggle. Under the resolute struggle of the masses, the puppet provincial governor was forced to announce the cancellation of the original decision.
    The U.S.-puppet clique's conspiracy to carry out large-scale forced relocation around Tay Ninh and Bac Lieu cities to expand military bases has also been strongly opposed by people from all walks of life in the local area.
    Xinhua News Agency, 18th (Dispatch) Saigon News: The struggle for power among the various factions of the South Vietnamese puppet clique remains deadlocked. With the U.S.-puppet clique in a state of chaos, the people of Hue, Da Nang, and other places in South Vietnam have continued to wage struggles against the United States and its lackeys, the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, since the 15th.
    The ugly show of the so-called "National Political Congress" staged by the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique under the direction of U.S. imperialism failed to ease the contradictions between the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique and the Nguyen Chanh Thi clique in the central region of South Vietnam. According to a United Press International report from Saigon on the 16th, some "struggle committees" in several provinces in the central region of South Vietnam have detained at least twenty-two officials of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, including a puppet provincial governor and a puppet county magistrate. Nguyen Van Man, the puppet mayor of Da Nang City, also stated on the 15th, following Nguyen Chanh Thi, that he would continue the "struggle" until the Saigon puppet regime resigned. According to Agence France-Presse, in Saigon, the Buddhist "Dare-to-Die Corps," which has always opposed the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique, continued to train in the Hoa Dao Institute on the morning of the 16th. A United Press International dispatch from Saigon on the 15th said: "A crisis within a crisis is brewing," and "the crisis in the armed forces may erupt into a bloody power struggle in the near future."
    According to Western news agencies, students and other masses in Hue continue to oppose the United States and the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. United Press International reported: "University students today (15th) vowed to continue the anti-government struggle until Nguyen Cao Ky is overthrown or steps down." This news agency reported again on the 17th: "Anti-government students today accused the United States of wanting to turn Vietnam into its fifty-first state." Students said in broadcasts from the Hue radio station in the central region of South Vietnam controlled by the Nguyen Chanh Thi clique, "Americans are acting in Vietnam as if they were in their own country, they not only choose our government, but they even choose government leaders down to the mayor level." The students broadcast a telegram of support from the "Cleveland Committee to End the War in Vietnam" in Ohio, USA, which said, "The problem in Vietnam is caused by the intervention of our (U.S.) government."
    According to reports, fifty organizations in the city that oppose the Saigon puppet clique stated: "They will continue the struggle to overthrow the military government." Ten thousand middle school and university students will continue to hold "indefinite" strikes.
    According to reports, in Da Nang, in the central region of South Vietnam, three thousand people took to the streets on the 16th, shouting slogans to overthrow the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky puppet clique. They condemned the "National Political Congress" as merely a tool of this puppet clique.

    反对帝国主义也要反对帝国主义的走狗
    南越人民反美伪集团斗争浪潮彼伏此起
    许多城镇工人和居民纷纷展开反对迫害和压榨斗争
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方许多城镇的工人和居民，最近不断展开斗争，反对美伪集团的迫害和压榨。
    在三月底西贡和嘉定地区的许多工会组织的代表，开会决定继续展开反对美伪集团的斗争，要求增加工资和降低物价。
    会议指出，美国对南越进行的侵略战争，破坏了南越的经济，使物价飞涨，给城市的供应带来了困难，使城市人民陷入贫困和饥饿的境地。
    土龙木省油汀镇大约五百名橡胶工人，在三月二十四日举行集会，强烈谴责美伪集团和橡胶园老板加紧剥削工人，使工人的生活日益贫困的罪行。在这以前，这个橡胶园的工人还曾在二月十四日和三月三日，两次到油汀镇游行，抗议美伪集团炮击橡胶园、迫害工人以及橡胶园老板克扣工人的口粮等罪恶行动。
    嘉定、西宁和薄寮等城市的人民，三月份接连开展斗争，反对美伪集团拆毁民房、强迫迁移的暴行。
    三月二十一日，嘉定市富润街二百多个居民涌到伪街区办事处，抗议美伪集团企图开辟一条马路让美军车辆进出新山一机场。二十三日，这条街的群众又涌进嘉定省伪政权办事处和伪省长住宅进行斗争。在群众的坚决斗争下，伪省长被迫宣布撤销原来的决定。
    美伪集团企图在西宁市和薄寮市周围进行大规模迫迁，扩建军事基地的阴谋，也遭到当地各阶层人民的强烈反对。
    新华社十八日讯　西贡消息：南越傀儡集团各派群丑之间争权的斗争仍然相持不下。在美伪集团陷入一片混乱的情况下，越南南方顺化、岘港等地人民从十五日开始，继续进行反对美国及其走狗阮文绍—阮高其集团的斗争。
    美帝国主义一手导演的由阮文绍—阮高其傀儡集团出面召开的所谓“全国政治代表大会”的丑剧，并未能缓和阮文绍—阮高其集团同南越中部中区阮正诗集团之间的矛盾。据合众国际社十六日自西贡报道，南越中部中区几个省的一些“斗争委员会”已经拘留了至少二十二名阮文绍—阮高其集团的官员，其中有一名伪省长、一名伪县长。岘港市伪市长阮文曼十五日继阮正诗之后也表示将继续进行“斗争”，直到西贡傀儡政权辞职为止。据法新社报道，在西贡，一向反对阮文绍—阮高其集团的佛教“敢死队”十六日上午继续在化道院里进行训练。合众国际社十五日发自西贡的消息说：“危机里的危机正在酝酿中”，“武装部队里的危机可能在不久的将来爆发为流血的争权斗争。”
    据西方通讯社报道，顺化的学生和其他群众继续反对美国和阮文绍—阮高其集团。合众国际社报道说：“大学生今天（十五日）发誓要继续进行反政府斗争，直到阮高其被推翻或下台为止。”这家通讯社十七日又报道说：“反政府学生今天指责美国想把越南变成它的第五十一州。”学生们在阮正诗集团控制的南越中部中区的顺化电台的广播中说，“美国人在越南办事就象他们在自己国内一样，他们不仅挑选我们的政府，而且直到市长一级的政府领导人也都是他们挑选的。”学生们在电台广播了一份来自美国“俄亥俄州克利夫兰结束越南战争委员会”发的声援电报，这份电报说，“越南问题是由于我们（美国）政府的干预造成的。”
    据报道，这个城市的五十个反对西贡傀儡集团的组织表示：“他们将继续进行推翻军政府的斗争”。一万名大中学生将继续举行“无定期”罢课。
    据报道，在南越中部中区岘港，有三千人十六日上街示威，高喊打倒阮文绍—阮高其傀儡集团的口号。他们谴责“全国政治代表大会”不过是这个傀儡集团的工具。
