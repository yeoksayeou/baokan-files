    Pretending to be Confused is False, Clarity is True
    Zhao Anting, Commune Member of Chengguan Commune, Lijin County, Shandong Province
    In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han not only fails to dig into the ideological roots of his errors but also tries to conceal the creative purpose of writing works like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," attempting to muddle through. He says that the "purposefulness of writing these articles was unclear and confused at the time," and that he "completely forgot the principle of literature and art serving proletarian politics." This is obviously trying to deny responsibility, refusing to admit it, thereby exposing his plan to resist to the end.
    As everyone knows, all human actions are governed by thought. There simply is no such thing as doing things without being governed by thought. Moreover, Comrade Wu Han is a so-called expert in Ming Dynasty history. Could he write such a large-scale historical drama without thinking? Our commune members can see clearly that the "using the past to serve the present" principle that Comrade Wu Han shouts about all day long is just "using the past to satirize the present!" In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han says on the one hand that the purpose of writing works like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was "unclear and confused at the time." On the other hand, he also says that he wrote about Hai Rui after the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was published in August 1959, in order to cooperate with the editorials published in the *People's Daily* and *Red Flag* magazine, and to protect "Lord Hai" from being "imitated" and "distorted." Isn't this too contradictory? In fact, pretending to be confused is false, clarity is true. Comrade Wu Han not only did not stand in the forefront of the anti-Rightist struggle under the leadership of the Party with the people of the whole country, but instead echoed them, clamoring for "land return" and "redressing unjust verdicts," and expressed deep sympathy for the anti-Party elements who were "dismissed" from "office," singing a duet with the Communiqué of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, inciting a small group of demons and monsters in society to wildly promote the "going-it-alone wind" and the "reversal of verdicts wind," fueling their crazy anti-Party and anti-socialist arrogance. This is precisely his writing purpose!

    糊涂是假，清楚是真
    山东省利津县城关公社社员  赵安亭
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中，不但不从思想根源上挖掘自己的错误实质，反而极力掩饰他写《海瑞罢官》等作品的创作目的，企图蒙混过关。他说什么写这些文章的“目的性是什么，在当时是不清楚的，糊涂的”，“把文艺为无产阶级政治服务的原则，完全忘记了”。这显然是想耍赖，不认账，从而暴露出他顽抗到底的计划。
    大家知道，人的一切行动都是受思想支配的，根本不存在不经思想支配而做出来的事情。何况吴晗同志是所谓研究明史的专家，难道不经大脑考虑就能写出这样的大型历史剧？我们社员们看得清楚，吴晗同志成天叫喊的“古为今用”的原则，只不过是“借古讽今”而已！吴晗同志在“自我批评”中一方面说自己写《海瑞罢官》等作品的目的“在当时是不清楚的，糊涂的”。另一方面又说，他写海瑞是在一九五九年八月中共八届八中全会发表公报以后，为了配合《人民日报》和《红旗》杂志所发表的社论，为了保护“海大老爷”不被“假冒”和“歪曲”而写的。这不是太矛盾了吗？其实，糊涂是假，清楚是真。吴晗同志不但不和全国人民一道，在党的领导下站在反右倾斗争的前列，反而和他们相呼应，大叫“退田”和“平冤狱”，并对被“罢”了“官”的反党分子深表同情，同党的八届八中全会公报唱对台戏，煽动社会上一小撮牛鬼蛇神大吹“单干风”、“翻案风”，助长他们反党反社会主义的疯狂气焰。这正是他的写作目的！
