    "Stopping the Projector" and "Starting the Machine"
    Song Zhentao, A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army
    The news that employees of the Heilongjiang Provincial Film Distribution and Projection Company had successfully experimented with stopping the projector to show films is very exciting. The spirit of these employees, who dared to think and dare to create, starting from the needs of the peasants, is truly commendable!
    Due to my work, I also often come into contact with film projectionist comrades. We also fully understand the broad masses of the audience's desire to see more of our great leader Chairman Mao on the screen, and we also fully understand the request of many comrades who want to "slow down" scientific and educational films to learn knowledge. But we never thought about "stopping the projector." In addition to problems with work attitude, an important reason is: metaphysical thinking is at play in the way we think, blindly believing in "machines." It is generally believed that stopping the projector will burn the film, which is considered "science." But we have not truly understood that everything in the world is changeable. First, we carried the ideological "burden" in our spirits. How could we start the thinking "machine" to seriously think about it!
    The success of the "stopping the projector" experiment has made it possible for films to better serve the peasants. Today, all aspects of cultural work are vigorously facing the countryside. How many problems similar to "stopping the projector" need to be solved? Chairman Mao pointed out the direction for us: "If we both put down our burdens and started our machines, if we are both lightly loaded and able to think, then we will be victorious."

### “停机放映”和“开动机器”

    “停机放映”和“开动机器”
    解放军某部　宋振涛
    黑龙江省电影发行放映公司职工试验成功停机放映电影的消息，很使人兴奋。这些职工从农民需要出发，敢于思索、敢于创造的精神，实在是难能可贵的！
    由于工作关系，我也经常接触电影放映员同志，我们也十分了解广大观众想在银幕上多看一会伟大领袖毛主席的愿望，也十分了解许多同志为了学知识希望把科教片“放慢一点”的要求。但是我们却从来没有想过“停机放映”的事。这除了工作态度方面的问题外，一个重要原因是：思想方法上的形而上学在作祟，对“机器”盲目迷信。总认为停机放映要烧影片是“科学”，没有真正懂得，世间万事万物都是可变的。首先在精神上背了“包袱”，哪里还会开动思想“机器”去认真思索呢！
    “停机放映”试验成功，使电影能更好地为农民服务了。今天，文化工作的各个方面都在大力面向农村，有多少类似“停机放映”的问题需要人们解决啊！怎样解决？毛主席给我们指出了方向：“如果我们既放下了包袱，又开动了机器，既是轻装，又会思索，那我们就会胜利。”
