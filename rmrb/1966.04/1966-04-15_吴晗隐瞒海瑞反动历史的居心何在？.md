    What is Wu Han's Motive for Concealing Hai Rui's Reactionary History?
    Feng Lei
    Summary: Hai Rui was a native of Hainan. He consistently stood on the side of the Han Chinese landlord class and opposed the Hainan people's uprising. He repeatedly devised plans for the Ming Dynasty to completely eliminate the Li people. In order to achieve his reactionary political goals, Comrade Wu Han deliberately avoided this reactionary history of Hai Rui and portrayed him as a savior who "stood up for the people."

    Comrade Wu Han not only stood on the side of the feudal landlord class, offering fervent praise for Hai Rui, but also, in order to achieve his anti-Party and anti-socialist political aims, deliberately concealed Hai Rui’s reactionary history of opposing the Hainan people's uprising.

    Hai Rui was a native of Hainan and was particularly concerned with maintaining the Ming Dynasty's rule over Hainan Island. He devoted his life to, and exerted himself in, suppressing the Hainan people's uprising and consolidating the cruel rule of the landlord class.

    In the Ming Dynasty, the people of Hainan suffered severe exploitation, and the class struggle was unprecedentedly acute.

    During the Ming Dynasty, the feudal exploitation suffered by the Li and Han peoples on Hainan Island was even heavier than in previous dynasties. According to Tang Zhou's "Qiong Tai Zhi," the total cultivated land area on Hainan Island in the Yuan Dynasty was 15,519 qing, with an autumn grain tax of 16,511 shi; in the early Ming Dynasty, the cultivated land area only increased to 19,856 qing, but the autumn grain tax increased to 96,384 shi. Tang Zhou said it was "five times that of the Yuan," but in reality, it was almost six times. After the mid-Ming Dynasty, exploitation became even more severe than in the early Ming Dynasty, leaving the people impoverished, desperate, and unable to bear the burden. In addition to the regular taxes, a wide variety of miscellaneous levies, such as commercial taxes, fishing taxes, rental taxes, kiln taxes, land taxes, and household salt taxes, also placed a heavy burden on the people of Hainan.

    Corvée labor was another hardship for the people of Hainan. In particular, the corvée labor of transporting money and grain to Beijing every year involved traveling over mountains and seas, "enduring cold and heat," and "often took a year and six or seven months to complete the round trip," "and the number of deaths and illnesses was countless" (Draft of Qiongzhou Prefect Xie Tingrui).

    "Tribute" was a special form of exploitation by the Ming Dynasty against the people of Hainan. It stipulated that six categories and thirteen types of native plants and animals had to be offered as tribute, in considerable quantities. Local officials in Qiongzhou, in order to "exploit the Li people for merit," offered tribute every three years, with varying amounts. If the people of Hainan were unable to provide it, the so-called "pacifying the Li" officials would even use ginger water to force the Li people. This aroused the unparalleled hatred of the people of Hainan towards the Ming Dynasty's feudal rulers.

    In Hainan Island, officials in office throughout the dynasties unscrupulously carried out exploitation and extortion. Anyone who had served as an official in Qiongzhou "returned north laden with wealth." Therefore, even Hai Rui himself had to admit: "Since I became an official, wherever I have been, I have largely encountered the grievances of the Tang people: 'It is better for bandits to come than officials to come and kill me.' This is especially true in Qiong."

    These three feudal exploitations of taxes, corvée labor, and tribute, coupled with the extortion of officials, both big and small, weighed the people of Hainan down so much that they could not straighten their backs or catch their breath. They constantly launched armed uprisings to resist the feudal exploitation of the landlord class and the oppressive policies of the Han chauvinists, launching heroic attacks against the feudal rule of the Ming Dynasty. According to documents such as "Ming Shilu," "Ming History," and "Tianxia Junguo Libingshu," as well as local chronicles of Hainan Island, from the early Ming Dynasty to the late Ming Dynasty, there were no fewer than one hundred armed uprisings of the Li and Han people on Hainan Island, breaking out roughly every few or ten years. The insurgent people formed groups of thousands, attacking prefectures and counties, and assaulting garrison posts. The Ming Dynasty's reactionary government dispatched tens of thousands of troops to carry out "extermination campaigns" and cruel suppression. However, the people of Hainan never succumbed, and they continued their anti-feudal struggle, one after another.

    During the Chenghua reign, the Li people Fu Nanan, Fu Nazuo, and Chen Nayang successively launched uprisings. The Ming army "launched three expeditions," but the more it suppressed, the more violent the resistance became, arousing even stronger resistance from the Li people.

    During the Hongzhi reign, Prefect Zhang Huan was "greedy, cruel, and privately levied taxes, greatly losing the hearts of the Li people"; after Prefect Yu Jun was replaced, he was "even more greedy and cruel, causing the Li people to suffer." The Li people of Danzhou and Changhua County suffered from "frequent official service." In July of the fourteenth year of Hongzhi, Fu Nanshe, the Li leader of the seven-fang tong, passed on uprising signals with carved arrows. The Li tongs of various prefectures and counties responded to the call and launched the massive Fu Nanshe uprising. The insurgent army "spread horizontally and vertically, and no one could frustrate them for years," "shocking the surrounding prefectures," and "the garrison troops could not conquer them," "and many officials abandoned the cities and fled." Later, under the attack of tens of thousands of wolf-earth soldiers mobilized by the Ming Dynasty, the insurgent army was defeated.

    During the Jiajing, Longqing, and Wanli reigns in which Hai Rui lived, the class contradictions on Hainan Island were unprecedentedly acute, and the class struggle was particularly tense.

    In the twenty-eighth year of Jiajing, the "abusive exactions" and "insatiable demands" of the magistrate Shao Jun and judge Huang Benjing and their ilk forced the Li people and some Han people to rise up in revolt. Na Yan, the Li leader of Yazhou County, Ganen County, sent arrows to the four directions, uniting the Li people of several counties, including Qiongzhou, Yazhou, Ganen, and Changhua, "to maintain their alliance and resist the government." The insurgent people "sounded gongs and drums, disregarding the prefectures and counties," "逼近崖州，围感恩逼近 Yazhou and surrounded Ganen," attacking Lingshui, Wanzhou, Wenchang and other counties, "attacking and destroying cities," killing soldiers so that "fat and blood covered the fields." The insurgent army had firm revolutionary nature and strong combat effectiveness. The government troops "could not entice them to carry their party, nor could they divide their forces." The rulers once attempted to appease the insurgents, but they also failed, and could only lament: "Clinging to their stubbornness to the end, they cannot be appeased!" In March of the twenty-ninth year of Jiajing, the rulers gathered "wolf, tong, Han, and Da official troops" from Liangguang, claiming to be 100,000 strong, and attacked Wuzhi Mountain in three routes. This great uprising was unfortunately defeated.

    During the Na Yan uprising, the class alignment on Hainan Island was very clear: on one side was the revolutionary Hainan people, represented by Na Yan's insurgent army, and on the other side was the reactionary landlord class and its scholar-officials, represented by the Ming Dynasty's official army. In this situation, standing on which side was the fundamental marker for judging a person's class stance. It was at this time that Hai Rui, as a schemer and propagandist against the Hainan people's uprising, made his first appearance on the historical stage.

    In "Ping Li Shu" and "Zhi Li Ce," Hai Rui demanded that the Li people be exterminated

    In the year that the Na Yan uprising broke out (1549), Hai Rui participated in the township examination and wrote "Zhi Li Ce" [Strategy for Governing the Li], which was highly appreciated by the reactionary Ming Dynasty rulers, and thus he became a recommended scholar.

    In the year that the Na Yan uprising failed (1550), Hai Rui went to Beijing to take the imperial examination and submitted a "Ping Li Shu" [Memorial on Pacifying the Li], reiterating the meaning of "Zhi Li Ce," and also sent a "Illustrated Explanation" to the Ministry of War.

    From these three counter-revolutionary documents, it can be clearly seen that Hai Rui stood on the side of the Han Chinese landlord class and opposed the Hainan people's uprising. He compared the Li people living in the middle of Hainan Island to "vipers entering a room," making Qiongzhou "not able to be peaceful for a day." He demanded that the reactionary rulers eradicate the Li people at the root, in order to remove "a disease of the heart and abdomen," so as to avoid "troubles in the limbs." Later, in "Shen Hainan Dao Chen Shuangshan Wen," he even more viciously said: "If the Li collapse, then three prefectures and ten counties will be in trouble," "without the Li, then three prefectures and ten counties can be tranquil," and even inhumanly demanded: "Remove twenty to thirty thousand Li people, to secure five hundred and sixty thousand common people; add five to seven years of effort, to achieve ten million years of ease." That is to say, to exterminate the Li people in order to maintain the long-term rule of the feudal landlord class. Here, Hai Rui's landlord class stance and Han chauvinistic thought are completely exposed.

    Comrade Wu Han beautified Hai Rui, saying that he "thought of the people everywhere and in everything throughout his life, seeking benefits for the people." In fact, Hai Rui spent his life thinking about the feudal state and seeking benefits for the landlord class. He wrote "Zhi Li Ce" and "Ping Li Shu" in order to "eliminate future troubles and seek long-term peace" for the landlord class, "saving the state unnecessary expenses and relieving Your Majesty's worries." He not only could "not avoid the axe" to "plan for those in charge," submitting memorials at the palace gate, but also volunteered, taking it as his own responsibility to pacify the Li and govern Qiong, requesting orders from the court, guaranteeing that "if he could be solely responsible for the matter, drive between the military, so that the Li land would all be governed land." He even signed a military pledge: "If things are not effective, please willingly submit to the highest punishment to atone for the crime of deceiving and wasting military grain." May I ask: how can Hai Rui, who was so devoted and loyal to the landlord class and the feudal state, concerned and exerting himself, loyal and selling his life, viewing the insurgent people as enemies, be said to be "for the people"? How can it be said that he was "fighting against the bureaucrat landlords"? Comrade Wu Han, disregarding the facts and reversing black and white in this way, distorting history, then, on which class stance is he speaking, and with what viewpoint is he studying history? Isn't the problem very clear?

    The landlord class stance shown by Hai Rui in "Zhi Li Ce" and "Ping Li Shu" was what he adhered to throughout his life. Throughout his life, he wrote many letters, devising plans for the civil and military officials of Guangdong and Qiongzhou, continuing to promote his magic tricks for pacifying the Li and governing Qiong. He also wrote many prefaces, praising the executioners who suppressed the Hainan people's uprising, "extolling" their "good governance" in slaughtering the Hainan people. These things are all collected in "Hai Rui Ji" [Collected Works of Hai Rui]. Why did Comrade Wu Han turn a blind eye and avoid talking about them? Abandoning the class contradictions and class struggle of the Ming Dynasty, abandoning Hai Rui's attitude towards the people's revolution, how can we correctly judge Hai Rui's class stance?

    Let us take another look at the content and essence of Hai Rui's plans for pacifying the Li and governing Qiong, in order to further understand the reactionary class nature of Hai Rui as a member of the feudal rulers.

    In his letter "Reply to Governor Ling Yangshan," Hai Rui wrote: "Incorporating the Li people into the territory is initially not difficult. Why? It is by intimidating them, by civilizing them, and by nibbling away at them." "Zhi Li Ce" and "Ping Li Shu" specifically embodied his "carrot and stick" "nibbling" policy. "Ping Li Shu" wrote: "...for long-term planning, open up crossroads, set up counties and cities, establish a participating general's office and a military preparation path in the center, then establish a pincer formation and form a nibbling trend." He suggested "reclaiming land" and "stationing troops" in key areas, transferring four thousand Guangxi indigenous soldiers, Guangdong Han Da official troops, and thugs to be stationed permanently in Qiongzhou for defense; in the event of an incident, ten thousand people would be called upon to carry out massacres. This move was called "military intimidation." He also suggested "setting up neighborhoods" and "building schools" in Li settlements, "compiling their tong chiefs and village chiefs into neighborhood chiefs, and the Li people under their jurisdiction into the head of the Jia." The Li people were required to cultivate land and pay taxes, and to study and know "rites," "not to be allowed to still carry bows and arrows when going in and out." In this way, the Li people would not want to resist, and if they did, they would not have weapons. This move was called "changing the heart and proclaiming civilization." It should be said that this move was more vicious than "military intimidation," and was also of greater interest to the rulers. Hai Rui's proposal of this reactionary policy fully proved that he was a loyal subject of the feudal ruling class. Therefore, as soon as his "Zhi Li Ce" and "Ping Li Shu" were released, they were immediately "widely circulated," "admired by those in the know," some wrote poems to praise them, and some engraved them to spread them. This precisely illustrates that Hai Rui's planned conspiracy to pacify the Li was in line with the interests of the landlord class.

    Comrade Wu Han's beautification of Hai Rui was completely to adapt to his needs for opposing the Party and opposing socialism

    The Hainan people's uprising was essentially a class struggle of the Li and Han people against the reactionary rulers of the Han and Li nationalities. Chairman Mao said: "National struggle, in the final analysis, is a question of class struggle." (See the "People's Daily" on August 9, 1963) The cruel exploitation of the Han landlords, officials, and upper-level rulers of the Li nationality was the fundamental reason for the Li people's uprising and the united uprising of the Han and Li people. Even Hai Rui had to admit that the Li people's uprising was "激之使然caused by incitement." The main reason for inciting the Li people's resistance struggle was due to "繁難的賦稅徭役和官吏的苛刻剝削onerous taxes, corvée labor, and the harsh exploitation of officials." In order to prevent the radical changes of the Han and Li people, Hai Rui once requested "朝廷之上，薄賦輕徭the court to reduce taxes and lighten corvée," in order to deceive the people. However, this was unworkable in the face of increasingly decadent feudal rule. Therefore, he also said: "糧額不可減固矣！軍事章程不能一日而緩固矣！The amount of grain cannot be reduced! The military regulations cannot be relaxed for a single day!" Once the uprising broke out, Hai Rui revealed the sinister face of a schemer.

    This is the historical Hai Rui.

    Such a schemer and propagandist against the Hainan people's uprising, in the writing of Comrade Wu Han, was dressed up as a savior who "stood up for the people." Comrade Wu Han dared to make such an unimaginable and enormous distortion of historical truth. What political needs were driving him? Since Comrade Wu Han praised Hai Rui, a reactionary who harbored deep hatred for the people's revolution, so much, then he must have intended something else and entrusted his feelings to something! Comrade Wu Han deliberately concealed such major historical facts as Hai Rui's opposition to the people's revolution, especially the Hainan Li people's revolution. This despicable method was completely to adapt to his political needs for opposing the Party and opposing socialism.

    吴晗隐瞒海瑞反动历史的居心何在？
    风雷
    提要　海瑞是海南人，他一贯站在汉族地主阶级立场上，反对海南人民起义。他几次为明王朝出谋划策，要把黎族人民全部消灭掉。吴晗同志为了达到他反动的政治目的，故意回避了海瑞这段反动历史，并把他打扮成“为民作主”的救星。
    吴晗同志不仅站在封建地主阶级的一边，对海瑞作了狂热的歌颂，而且为了达到他反党反社会主义的政治目的，还故意隐瞒了海瑞反对海南人民起义的反动历史。
    海瑞是海南人，对维护明王朝在海南岛的统治特别关心，并且为镇压海南人民起义，为巩固地主阶级的残暴统治，操了一辈子心，卖了一辈子力。
    明代海南人民受着惨重的剥削，阶级斗争空前尖锐
    明代，海南岛上的黎族人民和汉族人民所受的封建剥削，比前代更为繁重。据唐胄《琼台志》的记载，元代海南岛全部耕地面积是一万五千五百一十九顷，征收秋粮一万六千五百一十一石；明初，耕地面积只增加到一万九千八百五十六顷，而秋粮却增加到九万六千三百八十四石。唐胄说是“五倍于元”，实际上是将近六倍了。明代中叶以后，剥削比明初更加重，弄得人民山穷水尽，走投无路，根本无力负担。正税之外，商税、鱼课、赁房钞、窑冶钞、地利钞、户口食盐钞等五花八门的苛捐杂税，也给海南人民带来了沉重的负担。
    徭役更是海南人民的一项苦差使。尤其是每年运送钱粮的差役，从海南岛运到北京，跋山涉海，“冲寒冒暑”，“每经一年零六七个月方得完回”，“而死亡疾病者不可胜数。”（琼州知府谢廷瑞奏稿）
    “土贡”是明王朝对于海南人民的一种特殊剥削。规定要进贡土产动植物六类十三种，数量也相当大。琼州地方官为了“剥黎徼功”，三岁一贡，数额不定。而海南人民一旦拿不出来，所谓“抚黎”的官吏还要用姜水来灌逼黎族人民。因此，激起海南人民对明代封建统治者的无比仇恨。
    海南岛这个地方，历朝的任职官员都肆无忌惮地进行搜刮榨取。凡是到琼州做过官的，“十人九人满载而北”。所以，就连海瑞自己也不得不承认：“瑞自出仕至今，往返所到，大抵唐人‘寇来尚可，尹来杀我’之怨祸，此琼为甚。”
    赋税、徭役、土贡这三项封建剥削，加上大小官员的敲诈勒索，压得海南人民直不起腰，喘不过气来。他们不断地举行武装起义，反抗地主阶级的封建剥削和大汉族主义者高压政策，向明王朝的封建统治进行英勇的冲击。据《明实录》《明史》《天下郡国利病书》等文献和海南岛地方志的记载，从明初到明末，海南岛黎族人民和汉族人民的武装起义，不下百余次，差不多每隔几年、十几年就要爆发一回。起义人民千百成群，攻打州县，袭击卫所，明朝反动政府派出成千上万的大兵实行“雕剿”，进行残酷的镇压。但是海南人民从来没有屈服过，他们前仆后继地进行着反封建斗争。
    成化年间，黎族人民符那南、符那作、陈那洋先后起义，明军“三度征讨”，压迫愈甚，反抗愈烈，激起了黎族人民更强烈的反抗。
    弘治年间，知府张桓“贪残私敛，大失黎心”；换了个知府余浚，“贪刻尤甚，黎人苦之”。儋州昌化县黎族人民苦于
  “官役频繁”，弘治十四年七月间，七坊峝黎首符南蛇刻箭传递起义信号，各州县黎峝，闻风响应，爆发了声势浩大的符南蛇起义。起义军“势纵横，经年无能挫者”，“连郡震惊”，“镇兵讨之不下”，“吏多弃城走”。后来在明王朝调动了数万狼土兵的进攻下，起义军失败了。
    海瑞生活的嘉靖、隆庆、万历年间，海南岛的阶级矛盾空前尖锐，阶级斗争形势特别紧张。
    嘉靖二十八年，知州邵浚和判官黄本静这帮贪官污吏的“虐取”和“科索无厌”，迫使黎族人民和部分汉族人民起而反抗。感恩县崖州黎族首领那燕传箭四方，联合琼州、崖州、感恩、昌化等数县黎族人民，“保其约结，与官府抗”。起义人民“鸣钲击鼓，藐视郡县”，“逼崖州，围感恩”，进攻陵水、万州、文昌等县，“攻毁城郭”，杀得官兵“膏血遍野”。起义军有坚定的革命性和坚强的战斗力，官兵“诱之不能携其党，却之不能分其势。”统治者曾企图招抚起义者，但也失败了，只得哀叹：“怙终负固，不可招矣！”嘉靖二十九年三月，统治者从两广调集了“狼獞汉达官军”，号称十万，三路进攻五指山，这次大起义才不幸失败了。
    那燕起义期间，海南岛阶级阵容划分得一清二楚：一边是以那燕起义军为代表的革命的海南人民，一边是以明朝官军为代表的反动的地主阶级及其士大夫。在这种形势下，究竟站在哪一边，这是判断一个人的阶级立场的根本标志。正在这时，海瑞以反对海南人民起义的阴谋家和吹鼓手的姿态，初露头角，登上了历史舞台。
    海瑞在《平黎疏》、《治黎策》中要求把黎族人民斩尽杀绝
    那燕起义爆发那年（一五四九年），海瑞参加乡试，写了一篇《治黎策》，很得反动的明朝统治者的赏识，因此中了举人。
    那燕起义失败那年（一五五○年），海瑞进京赶考，上了一道《平黎疏》，重申了《治黎策》的意思，又给兵部送了一份《图说》。
    从这三份反革命文件中，可以清楚地看出：海瑞是站在汉族地主阶级立场上，反对海南人民起义的。他把黎族人民住在海南岛中间，比作“虺蛇入室”，使得琼州“不可一日安”。他要求反动统治者把黎族连根拔掉，以去“心腹之疾”，以免“四肢之患”。后来他在《申海南道陈双山文》中更恶毒地说：“黎溃则三州十县举受祸”，“无黎则三州十县可宁谧”，甚至灭绝人性地要求：“去二三万黎人，安五十六万百姓；加五七年功，成千万年逸。”这就是说，要把黎族人民斩尽杀绝，来维护封建地主阶级的长久统治。在这里，海瑞的地主阶级立场和大汉族主义思想，暴露无遗。
    吴晗同志美化海瑞，说他“一生处处事事为百姓设想，为民谋利”。其实海瑞一生是在为封建国家设想，为地主阶级谋利益的。他写《治黎策》和《平黎疏》，是为了给地主阶级“绝后患，图久安”，“省国家无已之费，纾陛下附髀之忧”。他不仅能够“不避斧钺”地“策于执事”，伏阙上疏，而且还毛遂自荐，以平黎治琼为己任，请命于朝廷，保证“倘得专任其事，驰驱兵革之间，俾黎土尽为治地”。他甚至还立下了军令状：“事如不效，请甘服上刑，以谢欺罔虚费兵粮之罪”。请问：象这样的披肝沥胆、忠心耿耿地为地主阶级和封建国家操心出力、效忠卖命、视起义人民如同寇仇的海瑞，怎么能说是“为民”的呢？怎么能说是在向“官僚地主作斗争”的呢？吴晗同志这样不顾事实地颠倒黑白，歪曲历史，那么，他是站在哪个阶级立场说话，是用什么观点去研究历史，问题不是很清楚吗？
    海瑞在《治黎策》和《平黎疏》中表现出来的地主阶级立场，是他终生坚守不渝的。他一生写过许多信，给广东和琼州的文武官员出谋划策，继续推销他的平黎治琼的锦囊妙计。他还写过许多序，为镇压海南人民起义的刽子手们歌功颂德，“揄扬”他们屠杀海南人民的“美政”。这些东西，都收在《海瑞集》里，吴晗同志为什么视而不见、避而不谈呢？抛开了明代的阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，抛开了海瑞对人民革命的态度，怎么能够正确评断海瑞的阶级立场呢？
    让我们再来看看海瑞的平黎治琼计策的内容和实质，以进一步了解做为封建统治者一员的海瑞的反动阶级本质。
    海瑞在《复总督凌洋山》的信中写道：“版图黎岐，初非难事。何也？威之也，化之也，蚕食之也。”《治黎策》和《平黎疏》具体体现了他的“威”“化”并用的“蚕食”政策。《平黎疏》写道：“……计久长，开通十字路，设县所城池，中峙参将府兵备道，则立犄角之形，成蚕食之势矣。”他建议在冲要地带“屯田”、“置军”，调广西土兵、广东汉达官军、打手四千人，常驻琼州，进行防卫；遇有事变，调用万人，进行残杀。这一手叫“兵威震慑”。他又建议在黎族聚居区“设里”、“建学”，“编其峒首村首为里长，所属之黎为甲首”。要黎族人民种田纳粮，读书知“礼”，“出入不许仍持弓矢”。这样一来，黎族人民就不要想反抗了，要反抗也没有武器了。这一手叫“革心宣化”。应该说，这一手比“兵威震慑”更为毒辣，也是统治者更感兴趣的。海瑞提出这个反动政策，充分证明了他是封建统治阶级的忠臣义士。所以他的《治黎策》和《平黎疏》一出笼，马上被“传诵一时”，“识者壮之”，有人写诗去称颂它，有人刻版来传播它。这正说明海瑞策划的平黎阴谋，是符合地主阶级的利益的。
    吴晗同志美化海瑞完全是为了适应他反党反社会主义的需要
    海南人民起义，实质上是黎族、汉族人民对汉族和黎族的反动统治者的阶级斗争。毛主席说：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”（见一九六三年八月九日《人民日报》）汉族地主官吏和黎族上层统治者的残酷剥削，是引起黎族人民起义和汉黎人民联合起义的根本原因。这一点连海瑞也不得不承认，他说，黎族人民起义是“有以激之使然”。而激起黎族人民反抗斗争的主要原因，是由于“赋役繁难，官吏刻削”。为了防止汉黎人民的激变，海瑞曾经要求“朝廷之上，薄赋轻徭”，以欺骗人民。但是，在封建统治日益腐朽的情况下，这是行不通的。所以他又说：“粮额不可减固矣！军事章程不能一日而缓固矣！”一旦起义爆发，海瑞就露出了阴谋家的狰狞面孔。
    这就是历史上的海瑞。
    这样的一个反对海南人民起义的阴谋家和吹鼓手，在吴晗同志笔下，却被打扮成了一个“为民作主”的救星。吴晗同志竟胆敢对历史真实作这样难以想象的巨大歪曲，究竟是出于什么样的政治需要呢？吴晗同志对海瑞这样一个对人民革命怀着刻骨仇恨的反动家伙既然这样颂扬备至，那肯定是意有所寄，情有所托！吴晗同志故意隐瞒海瑞反对人民革命，特别是反对海南黎族人民革命这样重大的史实，这种卑鄙手法，完全是为了适应他反党反社会主义的政治需要。
