    "The City Under Siege" completely distorts Chairman Mao's thought on people's war. Chairman Mao said that we should use revolutionary war to eliminate counter-revolutionary war, but the film shows that through the internal contradictions and struggles of the enemy, the enemy can automatically withdraw from the stage of history, completely obliterating our army's powerful political and military offensives, and even failing to see the power of the masses. A revolutionary war in which one class eliminates another class does not show any violent actions in the film, but is so elegant, so unhurried, so refined, so gentle, kind, respectful, thrifty, and yielding. The director is actually writing from the enemy's point of view.
    The Minister Jiang in the film is a seriously distorted and vilified character. This is not the image of a leading cadre of the Party, but rather like a lobbyist. He only compromises, begs, and tries to influence the enemy. Minister Jiang went deep into the tiger's den, but he went there calmly and returned in disgrace, without solving any problems. Look, he was well-dressed when he left, but when he arrived inside the enemy army, he only preached to Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen, hid all day long, and finally had to disguise himself, put on the uniform of a Kuomintang officer, and escaped back. And Zhao Chongwu did not revolt because he went there, but only because he saw a secret telegram from Chiang Kai-shek that he revolted.
    The director tries his best to uglify our army, but does his best to beautify the enemy army. When the city is under siege, the enemy should be panicked and uneasy, but many shots showing the enemy army write the enemy army as calm and composed. When Hu, the high-ranking staff officer, got off the plane, he happened to catch up with our army firing propaganda shells. He just smiled contemptuously. Even the ladies at the dance heard the sound of the People's Liberation Army's artillery and said contemptuously, "He fires his, we dance ours." Such a description is really infuriating.
    We believe that what is even more serious is that after the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party pointed out not to forget class struggle, the film's director insisted on telling people: the enemy can automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and can lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot. According to their fallacy, the enemy can become Buddhas on the spot by laying down their butcher knives. Now that it has been sixteen years since liberation, haven't those class enemies who have already laid down their butcher knives become Buddhas long ago? Don't we have to carry out class struggle today? The director's creation of this film is obviously with ulterior motives.

    《兵临城下》完全歪曲了毛主席关于人民战争的思想。毛主席说，我们要用革命战争消灭反革命战争，但影片表现的却是通过敌人的内部矛盾和斗争，敌人可以自动退出历史舞台，根本抹煞了我军强大的政治攻势和军事攻势，更看不到人民群众的力量。一场一个阶级消灭另一个阶级的革命战争，在影片里见不到一点暴烈的行动，而是那样的雅致，那样的从容不迫，文质彬彬，那样的温良恭俭让。编导者实际上是站在敌军立场上来描写的。
    影片中的姜部长是被严重歪曲和丑化了的人物，这不是党的领导干部的形象，简直象个说客，他只是一味地对敌人妥协、乞求、感化。姜部长曾深入虎穴，但他是从容而去，狼狈而归，什么问题也没有解决。你看，他去时衣冠楚楚，到了敌军内部，除了向赵崇武和郑汉臣说教外，就是成天躲起来，最后又被迫化了装，穿上国民党军官的衣服逃了回来，而赵崇武并没有因为他去而起义，最后还是因为看到蒋介石的一封密电才起义的。
    编导者对我军竭力丑化，而对敌军却尽力美化，在兵临城下时敌人应当是惊慌失措，惶恐不安的，但是，许多表现敌人的镜头却把敌军写得泰然自若，那个胡高参下飞机时正赶上我军打宣传弹，他只是轻蔑地笑了笑，甚至连舞会上的太太们听到解放军的炮声也轻蔑地说，他打他的，我们跳我们的。这样的描写实在令人气愤。
    我们认为，更严重的是，在党的八届十中全会指出不要忘记阶级斗争以后，影片编导者偏偏要告诉人们：敌人可以自动退出历史舞台，能够放下屠刀、立地成佛。按照他们的谬论，敌人放下屠刀就能立地成佛，现在解放十六年了，那些已经放下屠刀的阶级敌人岂不早就已经成佛了吗？我们今天岂不是不必进行阶级斗争了吗？编导者创作这部影片显然是别有用心的。
