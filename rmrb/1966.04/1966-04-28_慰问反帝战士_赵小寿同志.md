    A Message of Condolence to Anti-Imperialist Fighter Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou	Chen Yi
    In those serious days, the reactionaries violated international law and diplomatic privileges, attacking the Chinese Embassy! You and your comrades put up a heroic resistance.
    The reactionaries were truly cowardly, they opened fire! You were the first to be wounded, a bullet piercing your right chest cavity.
    You still resolutely resisted, never retreating, causing the reactionaries to flee in panic, and with great alarm.
    You resisted the reactionaries’ armed attack with your bare hands,
    You are truly heroic, you are truly a good example of self-defense!
    Good example! Good example!
    After the fact, the reactionaries said, the Chinese are truly amazing, all Chinese know Kung Fu.
    We say: We don't know Kung Fu, we only rely on the friendship between the people of all countries and the great Mao Zedong Thought.
    See how weak the reactionaries are, how heroic you are, I congratulate you on winning a great victory this time.
    The Chinese people are not to be trifled with!
    The people of all countries are not to be trifled with!
    The reactionaries of all countries, relying on the instigation and support of US imperialism, will not have a good end!
    China's great writer Lu Xun said—
    A blood debt must be repaid with blood!
    Please, American imperialism and all reactionaries, think about it carefully!
    The friendship between the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and China is stronger than the Great Wall.
    If you don't believe it, come and compete again.
    You will all be buried there together!

    慰问反帝战士——赵小寿同志	陈　毅
    在那严重的日子里，反动派破坏国际公法和外交特权，向中国大使馆进攻！你和同志们作了英勇的抵抗。
    反动派真懦弱，他们开了枪！你首先负伤，一颗子弹打穿了你的右胸腔。
    你们仍然坚决抵抗，绝不退让，使反动派仓皇逃走，而且十分惊慌。
    你们赤手空拳便抵抗住反动派的武装进攻，
    你们真英勇，你们真是进行自卫的好榜样！
    好榜样！好榜样！
    反动派在事后说，中国人真了不起，中国人都会拳术。
    我们说：我们不会拳术，我们只依靠各国人民间的友谊和伟大的毛泽东思想。
    你看反动派多么虚弱，你们是多么英勇，我庆祝你们这一次打了大胜仗。
    中国人民是不好惹的！
    各国人民也是不好惹的！
    各国反动派仗恃美帝的指使和支援，他们不会有好下场！
    中国伟大的文学家鲁迅先生说——
    血债要用血来偿还！
    请美帝国主义和一切反动派，你们好好想一想！
    亚非拉和中国人民之间的友谊比万里长城还坚强。
    你们不相信就再来较量。
    你们在那儿会一起被埋葬！
