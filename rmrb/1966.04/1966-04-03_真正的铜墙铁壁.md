    The reactionaries, in order to stabilize their dominance of exploitation and suppression of the people, have always engaged in large-scale construction, building impregnable fortresses, and pinning their hopes for lasting peace on their so-called walls of iron. From the magnificent castles of the Roman Empire to Hitler's Siegfried Line; from the solid bunkers of the Japanese militarists to Chiang Kai-shek's tortoise shell, all these things were regarded by them as remarkable marvels. But, before long, these seemingly solid castles all collapsed one after another.

    American imperialism is also doing the same thing in South Vietnam. It once built tens of thousands of "strategic hamlets" in the countryside, attempting to use deep ditches, high walls, caltrops, and barbed wire to imprison the South Vietnamese people, severing their close ties with the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces, in order to ensure its colonial rule over South Vietnam. But how can earth, cement, steel bars, and iron plates stop the raging fire of the South Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation? Now, more than 80 percent of the "strategic hamlets" have been completely destroyed, and transformed into combat villages for the South Vietnamese people to strike at the American robbers.

    Saigon is the base camp of the American aggressors in South Vietnam; Da Nang, Pleiku, Vung Tau, and other cities are the air and sea bases of the American aggressors in South Vietnam. These places are heavily guarded and heavily fortified. The American aggressors thought that shrinking inside was the safest and most secure. However, at American military airfields in Pleiku, Vung Tau, and other places, mortar shells from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army often suddenly flew in, smashing American planes into heaps of scrap metal. In Da Nang, the South Vietnamese people's anger against American imperialism burned to the noses of the invaders, and the American consul was forced to come out and "apologize" to the demonstrating masses. Even in Saigon—the nerve center of American aggression in South Vietnam—the American "embassy," headquarters, and officer buildings could not avoid being bombed time and time again. On April 1, with another deafening roar, the largest American military dormitory in Saigon was almost turned into ruins. Like all reactionaries in history, the facilities and barriers that American imperialism thought were impregnable have ultimately become graveyards for burying them.

    The "walls of iron" constructed by the reactionary rulers are actually not walls of iron at all. They can be completely broken. Because their reactionary throne is built on the foundation of enslaving, exploiting, and oppressing the broad masses of people. They are in fundamental opposition to the broad masses of the people, and the masses of the people will eventually rise up to oppose them. It is absolutely impossible for any reactionary force to rely on some solid fortifications and sharp weapons to escape its own defeat and final doom.

    What exactly is a wall of iron? Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out as early as thirty-two years ago: "It is the masses, the millions of people who genuinely and sincerely support the revolution. This is the real wall of iron, which no force can break through, and cannot be broken through." This means that when millions of people are mobilized, unite as one, and launch a vigorous revolutionary struggle, they can sweep away the strongholds of the reactionaries like a whirlwind, and finally completely destroy the palaces and thrones of the rulers pressing down on the people's heads.

    Only the revolutionary masses are an impregnable fortress. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the revolutionary armed forces led by the Chinese Communist Party, relying on the broad masses of the people, thrust steel knives into the heartland occupied by Japanese imperialism, developing and persisting in people's war. The Japanese imperialists' blockade and division of the liberated areas, and their iron-wall encirclements, were unable to eliminate the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people. On the contrary, they were ultimately completely defeated by the Chinese people. During the Liberation War, our Party likewise relied on the masses, who possessed a high degree of revolutionary spirit and tenacious revolutionary will—this real wall of iron—to destroy Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary dynasty.

    Today, the heroic South Vietnamese people are also relying on a high degree of revolutionary heroism and a revolutionary spirit of resolute victory, using primitive bows and arrows, machetes, bamboo spikes, and landmines, as well as modern weapons seized from the enemy, to build their own wall of iron. The South Vietnamese army and people are fighting heroically, constantly beating the 20th-century American atomic maniacs black and blue, plunging the most ferocious, brutal, and arrogant aggressor and executioner, American imperialism, into a desperate situation.

    The real wall of iron of the revolution is always able to subdue the seemingly unbreakable, reactionary fortresses and strongholds. The history of the people's revolution repeatedly proves this irrefutable truth.

    真正的铜墙铁壁
    何江
    反动派为了稳住自己剥削和镇压人民的霸业，从来都是大兴土木，修筑金城汤池，把长治久安的希望寄托在它们所谓的铜墙铁壁上面。从罗马帝国的巍峨城堡，到希特勒的齐格菲防线；从日本军国主义者的坚固碉堡，到蒋介石的乌龟壳，所有这些玩意儿，都被它们视为了不起的神物。但是，曾几何时，这些看来很牢固的城堡，一个个都倒掉了。
    美帝国主义在南越，也是搞的这一套。它在农村里曾经修筑了成千上万的“战略村”，企图用深沟、高垒、蒺藜、铁丝网，把南越人民囚禁在里面，割断他们同南越人民武装的密切联系，以便确保它对南越的殖民统治。但是，土木、水泥、钢筋、铁板，怎么能挡得了南越人民抗美救国斗争的熊熊烈火呢？现在，百分之八十以上的“战略村”已被彻底捣毁，一变而成为南越人民打击美国强盗的战斗村。
    西贡，是美国侵略者在南越的大本营；岘港、波来梅、头顿等城市，是美国侵略者在南越的海空基地。在这些地方，都是重兵把守，戒备森严。美国侵略者以为龟缩在里面，是最保险的，是最安全的。然而在波来梅、头顿等美军机场上，南越解放军的迫击炮弹常常突然飞来，把美国飞机捣成一堆废铜烂铁。在岘港，南越人民反对美帝国主义的怒火，烧到了侵略者的鼻子跟前，美国领事被迫出来向示威群众“道歉”。即使在西贡——这个美国侵略南越的神经中枢，美国“大使馆”、司令部、军官大楼，都免不了一次次地挨炸。四月一日，又轰然一声，西贡最大的美军宿舍，差不多成了一片废墟。象历史上的一切反动派一样，美帝国主义自以为固若金汤的设施和屏障，到头来，都变成了埋葬它们的坟场。
    反动统治者所构筑的“铜墙铁壁”，其实并不是什么铜墙铁壁。它是完全可以被打破的。因为它们的反动宝座是建筑在奴役、剥削和压迫广大人民的基础上的。它们同广大人民处于根本对立的地位，人民群众是终于要起来反对它们的。任何反动势力要想依靠一些牢固的工事和犀利的武器来逃避自己的失败和最后覆灭的命运，是绝不可能的。
    究竟什么是铜墙铁壁？毛泽东同志早在三十二年前就曾指出：“是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。”这就是说，当千百万人民群众动员起来，团结一致，展开轰轰烈烈的革命斗争，就能象狂飙一样把反动派的堡垒一扫而光，最后会把压在人民头上的统治者的宫殿和宝座彻底摧毁。
    只有革命群众，才是攻不破的堡垒。抗日战争时期，中国共产党所领导的革命的武装力量，依靠广大人民，把钢刀插入日本帝国主义占领的心脏地区，发展和坚持了人民战争。日本帝国主义对解放区的封锁分割、铁壁合围，都没有能够消灭中国人民的革命力量，相反，它们最后却被中国人民彻底打败了。在解放战争时期，我们党同样是依靠了具有高度革命精神和顽强革命意志的群众这一真正的铜墙铁壁，摧毁了蒋介石的反动王朝。
    今天，英雄的越南南方人民也是依靠高度革命英雄主义和决战决胜的革命精神，使用原始的弓箭、砍刀、竹尖桩和土地雷，以及从敌人手里缴获的现代化武器，筑成了自己的铜墙铁壁。越南南方军民英勇战斗，不断地将二十世纪的美国原子狂人打得焦头烂额，使当代最凶恶、最残暴和最狂妄的侵略刽子手美帝国主义，陷入了走投无路的窘境。
    革命的真正的铜墙铁壁，总是能够制服从表面看来似乎是牢不可破的、反动的堡垒要塞。一部人民革命史，反复地证明了这一颠扑不破的真理。
