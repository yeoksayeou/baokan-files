    This group of submissions succinctly raises the questions of what it means to emphasize politics and what it means to not emphasize politics from several different aspects. It should be said that there are questions of emphasizing or not emphasizing politics at all times, in all places, and in all matters. The question is whether you can see it clearly and grasp it. How do you emphasize politics in your work? This requires answering in conjunction with your own thinking and work.

    Why Should We Calculate the Political Account
    We have to focus on spring planting and drought resistance every year. In the past, we only paid attention to arranging tasks and setting deadlines, without focusing on ideology or talking about politics. Even when we talked about the significance of drought resistance, we mostly talked about how much grain production would be reduced and how much income would be reduced if the drought resistance task was not completed. In the end, we were just going around in circles with economic accounts.
    In 1965, the Socialist Education Movement educated us, enabling us to pay more attention to ideological and political work in our work. For example, in spring planting and drought resistance, we first organized cadres and the masses throughout the county to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Cast Away Illusions, Prepare for Struggle," which boosted the morale of the masses and strengthened their confidence that man can conquer nature. In grasping drought resistance work, we not only arranged tasks but mainly explained that transporting one more load of water and planting one more mu of land was for our country's socialist revolution and construction, and for supporting the people of all countries in their struggle against imperialism. In this way, people connected their labor with the national revolution and the world revolution.
    From the comparison, we see that: the production revolution is carried out by people, and people's actions are guided by their thoughts. People's understanding, people's emotions, and people's drive are the most important factors in the production revolution. In the past, drought resistance was not done well because some thoughts hindered the progress of drought resistance work. For example, at that time, some of the masses thought, "There is no day without rain," so they relied on heaven and waited for rain; individual commune members disregarded the collective and were busy with their private plots. And in the past, when we focused on drought resistance, we only talked about economic accounts, not political accounts. In the end, what we said did not match these thoughts. If ideological problems cannot be solved, the drought resistance movement will inevitably not be successful. The drought resistance in 1965 emphasized politics. The broad masses of people were not thinking about relying on heaven and waiting for rain, but about how to transport one more load of water for the revolution. The drought resistance movement was very successful. At this time, we realized that doing a good job in production is rooted in emphasizing politics. Once politics is emphasized, the masses' enthusiasm for building socialism will be mobilized, and their consciousness will be raised. The struggle for production must first begin with the ideological struggle, and the revolutionization of people must be grasped first. Only when people have political enthusiasm can they have lasting production enthusiasm.

### 为什么要算政治账

专栏：

    这组来稿，从几个不同的方面，扼要提出了什么叫突出政治、什么叫不突出政治的问题。应当说，时时、处处、事事都有突出政治或者不突出政治的问题。问题在于你是否看得清，抓得住。在各项工作中你是怎样突出政治呢？这需要结合自己的思想和工作来解答。

    为什么要算政治账
    春播抗旱，我们年年要抓。过去我们只注意布置任务，卡进度，不抓思想，不谈政治。即使讲讲抗旱的意义，也多是讲完不成抗旱任务，就减产多少粮食、减少多少收入。讲来讲去，都是在经济账上兜圈子。
    一九六五年，社会主义教育运动教育了我们，使我们在工作中比较注意抓人的思想政治工作。比如，在春播抗旱中，先组织全县干部和群众学毛主席的《愚公移山》、《丢掉幻想，准备斗争》等文章，长了群众的志气，增强了人定胜天的信心。在抓抗旱工作中，不只布置任务，主要讲明多运一担水，多种一亩地，就是为了我国的社会主义革命和建设，就是为了支援各国人民反对帝国主义的斗争。这样，人们就把自己的劳动同全国革命和世界革命联系起来了。
    从对比中我们看到：生产革命，是要由人来进行的，而人的行动，是受人的思想指导的，人的认识，人的情绪，人的干劲，是生产革命的最重要的因素。过去抗旱，所以搞得不够好，是因为一些思想障碍着抗旱工作的进行。比如当时一部分群众的想法是：“没有不下雨的天”，因此靠天等雨；个别社员不顾集体，忙着搞自留地。而我们过去抓抗旱，又是只讲经济账，不讲政治账，讲来讲去，和这些思想对不上号。思想问题解决不了，抗旱运动就必然搞不好。一九六五年的抗旱，突出了政治，广大群众想的不是靠天等雨，想的是如何为革命多运一担水，抗旱运动就搞得很好。这时，我们才体会到，搞好生产，根子在突出政治。政治一突出，群众建设社会主义的积极性就调动起来了，自觉性就提高了。生产斗争必须先从思想斗争开始，必须先抓人的革命化，人有了政治热情，才会有持久的生产热情。
