    Workers and Peasants of Xingguo County Criticize "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"	Jiangxi Provincial Historical Society
    Recently, we organized a discussion on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" with some workers, peasants, and veteran revolutionaries in Xingguo County (where Hai Rui served as magistrate for over a year). At the meeting, everyone was filled with righteous indignation and resolutely criticized Comrade Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist stance and thinking.
  "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a Poisonous Weed
      Against the Party and Socialism
    Zhong Qisong (Cadre of the County Personnel Bureau, former secretary of the Xingguo Chengguan District Committee in the Soviet Area): Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a big poisonous weed against the Party and socialism, and we poor and lower-middle peasants must resolutely eradicate it. Before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in August 1959, Wu Han spoke highly of Hai Rui "scolding" the emperor, saying that Hai Rui scolded well and scolded with pleasure. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, he vigorously promoted Hai Rui's "uprightness and integrity" after his dismissal. One scolding and two dismissals, this was to cooperate with the right-leaning opportunists in attacking the Party and socialism, and also to sing praises for the right-leaning opportunists who had been "dismissed" from their "official positions." It called on them to continue the struggle in order to restore capitalism. Wu Han said that we should learn from "Hai Rui," but in fact, he wanted people to learn from the right-leaning opportunists, learning their anti-Party and anti-socialist ways. How vicious Wu Han's intentions are!
    Huang Banghu (Member of the Wuliting Brigade, Wuliting Commune, poor peasant): In 1961, when our country was temporarily facing difficulties, Wu Han talked a lot about "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts," cooperating with the bourgeoisie, the four categories of elements, and right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party and socialism. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" said that Hai Rui "returned" the landlords' land to the peasants, saying that in this way, the people would have a good life. This was to ask our people's communes to "return land" to the landlords and rich peasants, implement individual farming, and restore capitalism. Wu Han said that Hai Rui "redressed unjust verdicts," which was to "rehabilitate" the four categories of elements, anti-Party, anti-socialist rightists, and right-leaning opportunists, and to "plead" for them. Wu Han's remarks were the same as the clamoring of the four categories of elements and rightists and right-leaning opportunists at that time. We must defend socialism, consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, and resolutely counter Wu Han's reactionary remarks.
    Liu Fengqi (Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Wuliting Commune): Wu Han's "returning land" is aimed at restoring individual farming and restoring capitalism. Saying "returning land" is false. Chiang Ching-kuo also used flowery language to clamor to implement "land to the tillers" in southern Jiangxi in the past. In fact, in the dark era when Chiang Ching-kuo ruled southern Jiangxi, the landlords' land became more and more, the peasants' land became less and less, exploitation became heavier and heavier, and the peasants' lives became more and more miserable. Only the Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead our peasants to take the road of collectivization, which is the bright road. Wu Han wanted to cooperate with the right-leaning opportunists to attack the Party and socialism, undermine the people's communes, and restore capitalism. This is wishful thinking, and we firmly oppose it.
    Landlords and Bureaucrats Build Water Conservancy Projects, Enriching the Landlords and Making the People Suffer
    Zhi Zhaoliang (Accountant of Wuliting Production Team, Wuliting Commune): Hai Rui did a little water conservancy, but it was also for the purpose of exploiting the peasants more. Because the land belonged to the landlords, and the peasants cultivated the landlords' land, if the harvest was more, the rent would increase, and the peasants would not get any benefit.
    Cui Zhongrang (Worker of Chengguan Town Clothing Factory): Wu Han said that Hai Rui built water conservancy projects, which benefited the people. Hai Rui built water conservancy projects, and I don't know how much money the people had to pay to build a little bit of water conservancy. The water conservancy was built by the working people, and the credit should be given to the working people, not to Hai Rui's credit book. Hai Rui built the "Chun Kou Dam" in Xingguo and planted pine trees on the "dam," which was entirely for the benefit of the landlord class, to maintain the "feng shui" of the landlords and bureaucrats in the city. The people spent their lives and money, without any benefit.
    Zou Chengqiu (Member of Changgang Brigade, Changgang Commune, poor peasant, former secretary of the Changgang Township Party Branch in the Soviet Area): Building water conservancy projects is for the landlords to harvest more grain and squeeze more of our blood and sweat. If it is built well, the benefits will not go to the landlords and rich peasants, and the ones who suffer will still be us peasants. We had to bring our own rice to work, whether we ate or not, whether we had money or not. In the old society, the sky was the landlord's sky, and the land was the landlord's land. Wu Han described things that benefited the landlords and rich peasants as benefiting the people. This is turning black and white upside down.
    Zhong Qisong: In the old society, the water conservancy built by officials was nominal, and the reality was drinking the blood and sweat of the working people. During the Kuomintang rule, they said they wanted to build the Dong Keng Zi Reservoir and asked us to "donate" money. After "donating" the money, they wanted to conscript labor again. It was always us poor and lower-middle peasants who suffered. As a result, the reservoir was not built, but the officials got rich.
    "Suing" is Not Class Struggle, Only Revolution is the Way Out
    Liu Huanshao (Accountant of Changgang Commune Nursing Home, former propagandist of the Security Team of the State Political Security Bureau in the Soviet Area): Wu Han said that suing is also class struggle, and peasants can get a way out by suing. This is nonsense. Where could peasants go to sue in the old society? There was no response to heaven, and there was no door to the earth. There was no place to speak reason. The old society only talked about money, not about reason. Those with more money had reason even if they had no reason. I heard an old man tell a story: In the past, two people went to court. One gave the county magistrate a carp, and the belly of the fish was filled with "lace" (ie, silver dollars). The first time in court, he won the lawsuit. The other person was not convinced. Knowing this situation, he sent the county magistrate a dog, stuffing "lace" in the dog's belly, with even more silver dollars. The next time in court, the county magistrate ruled that the person who sent the dog was right and ruled that he won the lawsuit. At this time, the person who sent the carp became anxious and said, "Lord, Lord, judge according to the carp (reason)!" The county magistrate said, "Judge according to the carp! Judge according to the carp! Don't you know what's in the dog's belly!" The government office was a tool for suppressing and extorting the people. In the old society, poor people had no place to speak reason. Only by rising up in revolution and overthrowing the bureaucrats and landlord class can we hold our heads high!
    Liu Jianheng (Director of Changgang Commune Nursing Home, poor peasant, former deputy political commissar of the Fifth Regiment of the Model Division of the Red Army in the Soviet Area): During the Qing Dynasty, we had a military officer named Zou who seized the land of a peasant named Lu. Those lawyers who specialized in getting rich by fighting lawsuits instigated Lu to file a lawsuit. As a result, Lu sold off his field ridges and house corners, but the land was still occupied by the military officer Zou, and the peasant named Lu was also arrested.
    "Seeking Justice for the People" is Completely Deceptive.
    Zhong Qisong: Wu Han wants us to kneel and kowtow to the "honest officials," which means he doesn't want us to revolt against the landlord and capitalist classes. As the saying goes:
  "The poor bow to the rich, and they can't afford to stand up." The more humbly you beg, the less they will pay attention to you, and the more they will oppress and exploit you. Only by following the Communist Party and Chairman Mao in making revolution can the poor and lower-middle peasants have a way out.
    "Eliminating Tyranny" is False, Relying on Tyranny, Supporting Tyranny, and Serving Tyranny is True
    Zhong Yueming: Wu Han said that Hai Rui "eliminated tyranny" for the people, which is nonsense. Hai Rui himself was a tyrant, the head of the landlord bullies. Chairman Mao said: "Warlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry are the political representatives of the landlord class and are the most vicious among the landlords." To eliminate tyranny, we must first eliminate him himself. They themselves are tyrants, and at the same time, they must rely on evil tyrants. If all the local tyrants and evil gentry are eliminated, who will he rely on to maintain his rule? Therefore, there is no question of Hai Rui eliminating any tyranny at all.
    Liu Jinlian (Member of Changgang Commune, poor peasant, former leader of the Women's Self-Defense Company of Changgang Township in the Soviet Area): The county officials in the past relied on the feudal landlords to do things. Officials and local tyrants and evil gentry wore the same pair of pants, colluding with each other and uniting to rule the people. During the land revolution, we Xingguo people had a folk song that sang: "First, overthrow the evil and corrupt officials, the corrupt officials' actions make the people uneasy; big and small matters are in their hands, following the local tyrants and evil gentry. Second, overthrow the evil local tyrants, the local tyrants' actions dig up the stove." Therefore, when we engage in revolution, we must overthrow the officials and local tyrants and evil gentry together.
    Huang Banghua (Poor resident of Xingguo Chengguan Town): Wu Han said that Hai Rui opposed the landlord bullies and "sought justice" for the people. I don't believe it. When I was a child (still in the Qing Dynasty), I saw a peasant being beaten to death by an evil tyrant. His relatives and friends carried the body to the yamen to sue. The county magistrate came out to examine the body, touched it here and there, kicked the body with his foot, and left, without doing anything. The evil tyrant who beat the man to death was not punished in the slightest, and the injustice of the man who was beaten to death was not redressed. I don't believe that the officials in the old society would "eliminate tyranny" or "seek justice" for the people.
    Liu Jianheng: In the old society, the landlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry were in charge. The common people had no right to speak. Xingguo County used to have the "Four King Kongs" (four big landlords and evil tyrants). They had the final say in the yamen's affairs. Once it got into their hands, our reason would become unreasonable.
    "Honest Officials" are Smiling Tigers
    Liu Fengqi: Hai Rui was an insidious and vicious feudal landlord bureaucrat. Wu Han said that Hai Rui was an "honest official," which is deceptive. "Honest officials" are smiling tigers, used by the feudal landlord class to deceive, oppress, and exploit the masses of the people. "All crows in the world are black." Taking Chiang Ching-kuo, a reactionary who claimed to be an "honest official" before liberation, as an example, we can see the reactionary essence of "honest officials." It is said that not long before liberation, Chiang Ching-kuo, in order to pretend to be a "good person," saw the puppet township chief arresting strong men in the puppet township government. He scolded the puppet township chief in front of the strong men and sent the strong men back. However, after the strong men left, he immediately ordered people to arrest the strong men back. In my opinion, Hai Rui is a smiling tiger like Chiang Ching-kuo.
    Guo Lianxiang (Secretary of the League Branch of Wuliting Brigade): I don't believe there were "honest officials" in the old society. Wu Han said that Hai Rui was not corrupt and did good things for the people, which is to deceive the people's eyes. We know that landlords and landlord bureaucrats are man-eating tigers. Where are there tigers that don't eat people? Before liberation, my father had farmed for the landlords, and the landlords didn't even give him food. His life was not even as good as a dog in the landlord's house. Even the landlords' dogs were not good, so where are the "honest officials"?
    Xie Yuansheng (Worker of Xingguo Chengguan Town Wicker Factory): It is false to say that there were "honest officials" with clean sleeves in feudal society. In the past, people became officials to get money and fame. If they couldn't get money, they wouldn't become officials. Hai Rui not only wanted money but also massacred the working people. I heard my father say that after Hai Rui came to Xingguo, he pretended to be a fortune teller, using flowery language to become sworn brothers with the leaders of the peasant uprisings in the eighteen villages of the county. Later, he invited them to drink and got them drunk, and Hai Rui killed them. He hung eighteen red lanterns on the building of the county yamen to celebrate "victory," which was also a threat to the people. This folk legend tells us that the masses of the people clearly understand that Hai Rui is the enemy of the people. But Comrade Wu Han insisted on saying that Hai Rui was an "honest official," that he "stood on the side of the people" and "made decisions for the people." Isn't this distorting and fabricating facts with his eyes open? We know that Hai Rui was a executioner who suppressed the peasant revolution and a loyal dog who protected the interests of the landlords. We laboring peasant masses have an irreconcilable hatred for the landlord bureaucrat Hai Rui and must never "combine two into one."
    Cui Zhongrang: Wu Han said that Hai Rui was an "honest official," "made decisions for the people," "redressed unjust verdicts" for the peasants, and "stood on the side of the peasants" in lawsuits. This is speaking for the landlords and gentry. Only the landlords and gentry called the feudal bureaucrats "honest officials." We laboring people believe that none of the feudal bureaucrats are good. They are all chief criminals riding on the heads of the people. There is not a single feudal bureaucrat who does not extort money or oppress the masses of the people. "The yamen opens eight characters, and those who have reason but no money should not enter." Hai Rui is also like this. Where is he "making decisions for the people" or "standing on the side of the peasants"?!"
    Wan Cairen (Member of Changgang Brigade, Changgang Commune, poor peasant, former company commander of a certain Red Army unit): Wu Han said that Hai Rui was an "honest official," so good, so good. I don't believe it. I am sixty-eight years old this year, and passing down through generations, I have never heard of any "honest officials." In the old society, there was no official who was not corrupt. Not to mention a county magistrate, even a Baozhang would take advantage of his power to bully people and extort money. Chiang Ching-kuo also said that he opposed corruption when he was the "Commissioner" in Ganzhou, calling himself a "blue sky." But he himself was a big corruption head. Opposing others' corruption was only to make his own pockets fuller. The laboring people were still oppressed and exploited in the same way. The Kuomintang county officials were also the same, going in and out in large sedan chairs carried by four people, with hundreds of people and dozens of guns, holding big banquets wherever they went. Their money was still the blood and sweat of the common people.

    兴国县工人农民批驳《海瑞罢官》	江西省历史学会
    最近，我们在兴国县（海瑞曾在该地当过一年多知县），组织了部分工人、农民和老革命同志座谈《海瑞罢官》。会上，大家义愤填膺地对吴晗同志的反党反社会主义立场和思想，进行了坚决的批判。
  《海瑞罢官》是一棵反党
      反社会主义的毒草
    钟起松（县人事局干部，原苏区兴国城关区委书记）：吴晗的《海瑞罢官》是一棵反党反社会主义的大毒草，我们贫下中农要坚决铲掉它。吴晗在一九五九年八届八中全会以前，大讲海瑞“骂”皇帝，说海瑞骂得好，骂得痛快。在八届八中全会后，又大肆宣扬海瑞罢官后的“刚直不阿”。一骂二罢，这是配合右倾机会主义分子向党向社会主义进攻，也是为“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子唱赞美歌。号召他们继续斗争，以复辟资本主义。吴晗说要向“海瑞”学习，实际上是要人们向右倾机会主义分子学习，学习他们反党反社会主义。吴晗的用心多么恶毒呀！
    黄邦湖（五里亭公社五里亭大队社员、贫农）：在一九六一年我们国家暂时困难的时候，吴晗大讲什么“退田”、“平冤狱”，配合资产阶级、四类分子、右倾机会主义分子向党、向社会主义进攻。《海瑞罢官》中说海瑞把地主的田“退”给农民，说这样人民有好日子过。这是要我们人民公社“退田”给地主、富农，实行单干，复辟资本主义。吴晗说海瑞“平冤狱”，这是要为四类分子、反党、反社会主义的右派和右倾机会主义分子“平反”，为他们“请命”。吴晗的言论和当时的四类分子和右派、右倾机会主义分子的叫嚷一样。我们要保卫社会主义，巩固无产阶级专政，对吴晗的反动言论，我们要坚决反击。
    刘逢棋（五里亭公社党委副书记）：吴晗的“退田”，目的是要恢复单干，复辟资本主义。说“退田”是假的，蒋经国过去在赣南也花言巧语地叫嚷要实行“耕者有其田”。其实，在蒋经国统治赣南的黑暗时代，地主的田越来越多，农民的土地越来越少，剥削愈来愈重，农民生活愈来愈苦。只有共产党、毛主席领导我们农民走集体化的道路，才是光明大道。吴晗想配合右倾机会主义分子向党向社会主义进攻，搞垮人民公社，复辟资本主义，这是妄想，我们坚决反对。
    地主官僚修水利，富了地主，苦了百姓
    芷兆良（五里亭公社五里亭生产队会计）：海瑞搞了一点水利，也是为了更多地剥削农民。因为田是地主的，农民种地主的田，收成多一些，地租就增加，农民得不到什么利益。
    崔忠让（城关镇被服厂工人）：吴晗说海瑞修过水利，对人民有利。海瑞修水利，不知道要人民出了多少钱，才搞起一点点水利。水利是劳动人民修的，功劳应该是劳动人民的，不能记在海瑞的功劳簿上。海瑞在兴国修过“春口坝”，在“坝”上栽松树，完全是为了地主阶级的利益，保持城内地主官僚的“风水”，人民劳命伤财，没有一点好处。
    邹成裘（长冈公社长冈大队社员、贫农、原苏区长冈乡党支部书记）：修水利是为了地主多收粮食，榨取我们更多的血汗，修好了，有利还不是归地主富农，吃亏的还是我们农民。自己带米去上工，吃没吃，钱没钱，在旧社会，天是地主的天，地是地主的地。吴晗把对地主富农有利的事，说成对人民有利，这是颠倒黑白。
    钟起松：旧社会的官修水利是名，喝劳动人民血汗是实。国民党统治时代，说要修东坑子水库，要我们“捐”钱。“捐”了钱以后，又要征工。总是我们贫下中农受罪。结果水库没有搞成，当官的却发了财。
    “告状”不是阶级斗争，只有革命才是出路
    刘焕绍（长冈公社敬老院会计、原苏区国家政治保卫局保卫队宣传员）：吴晗说，告状也是阶级斗争，告了状农民可以得活路。这是瞎说。在旧社会农民到哪里去告状？告天天不应，告地地无门，有理无处伸。旧社会只讲钱，不讲理，钱多没理也有理。听老人说过一个故事：过去有两个人去打官司，一个给县官送了条鲤鱼，鱼肚子里装满了“花边”（即银元）。第一次过堂，他就赢了官司。另一个人不服，知道了这情况，就给县官送了条狗去，在狗肚子里塞“花边”，银元更多。再过堂时，县官就判送狗的人有理，判他赢了官司。这时，送鲤鱼的人急了，就说：“老爷，老爷，要照鲤（理）判呀！”县官说：“照鲤判！照鲤判！你还不晓得狗肚子里的事！”官府衙门就是镇压和勒索人民的工具。在旧社会，穷人有理无处伸。只有起来革命，打倒官僚、地主阶级，才能扬眉吐气！
    刘建珩：（长冈公社敬老院院长、贫农、原苏区红军模范师兴国五团副政委）：清朝时，我们这里有个姓邹的军门，霸占了一个姓卢的农民的土地，那班专靠打官司发财的讼棍就挑唆卢去打官司。结果卢把田坎、屋脚都卖光了，土地还是被邹军门霸占了去，姓卢的农民还被押起来了。
    “为民伸冤”完全是骗人的。
    钟起松：吴晗要我们向“清官”跪拜、叩头，就是要我们不要革地主资产阶级的命。俗话说：
  “穷人拜富人，尽拜不起身。”你越是低声下气去哀求，他越是不理睬你，越是压迫、剥削你。贫下中农只有跟着共产党毛主席闹革命，才有出路。
    “除霸”是假，靠霸、扶霸、为霸是真
    钟月明：吴晗说海瑞为百姓“除霸”，这是胡说。海瑞本身就是个霸，是地主恶霸的头子。毛主席说：“军阀、官僚、土豪、劣绅是地主阶级的政治代表，是地主中特别凶恶者。”要除霸首先要除掉他自己。他们自己是霸，同时他也要依靠恶霸，如果把土豪恶霸都除掉了，他靠那个来维持自己的统治？所以，根本谈不上海瑞会除什么霸。
    刘金莲（长冈公社社员、贫农、原苏区长冈乡妇女自卫连连长）：过去的县官都是靠封建地主办事的。官吏和土豪劣绅穿的是连裆裤，勾勾搭搭，联合在一起统治人民。土地革命时，我们兴国人民有首山歌，唱道：“一要打倒恶贪官，贪官做事民不安；大小事情到他手，跟着土豪劣绅转。二要打倒恶土豪，土豪做事挖灶头”。所以我们搞革命，就要把官老爷和土豪劣绅一齐打倒。
    黄邦华（兴国城关镇贫民）：吴晗说海瑞反对地主恶霸，为人民“伸冤”。我就不相信。我小的时候（还是清朝），看见一个农民被恶霸打死了，他的亲戚朋友，抬着尸体到衙门前告状。县官出来验尸，东摸西摸一阵，用脚将尸体一踢，就走了，什么事也没做。打死人的恶霸没受一点处罚，被打死的人的冤也没有伸。我不相信旧社会的官吏会“除霸”，会为人民“伸冤”。
    刘建珩：旧社会就是地主官僚、土豪劣绅哇事，老百姓哪有哇事的权利。兴国县过去有“四大金刚”（四个大地主恶霸），衙门里的事，就是他们说了算。到了他们手里，我们有理也变成无理。
    “清官”是笑面虎
    刘逢棋：海瑞是一个阴险恶毒的封建地主官僚。吴晗说海瑞是“清官”，这是骗人的。“清官”是笑面虎，是封建地主阶级用以欺骗压迫和剥削人民群众的。“天下乌鸦一般黑”。就以解放前自己标榜为“清官”的反动派蒋经国来说，就可看出“清官”的反动本质。据说，解放前不久，蒋经国为了装做“好人”，他在伪乡政府看到伪乡长抓壮丁，就当着壮丁面，骂伪乡长，还把壮丁放回去。但是，等壮丁走后，他就马上叫人把壮丁抓回来。我看，海瑞是和蒋经国一样的笑面虎。
    郭莲香（五里亭大队团支部书记）：我不相信旧社会有“清官”。吴晗说海瑞不贪污，为人民办好事，这是要蒙蔽人民的眼睛。我们晓得，地主和地主官僚都是吃人老虎，那里有不吃人的老虎呢？解放前，我父亲曾给地主种过田，地主连饭也不给吃，他的生活还赶不上地主家里一只狗。地主家的狗也没有好的，那里有什么“清官”。
    谢远盛（兴国城关镇蔑器厂工人）：说封建社会有两袖清风的“清官”，这是假的。过去当官就是为了拿钱，为了名利，拿不到钱就不当官。海瑞不但要钱，还屠杀劳动人民。我听我父亲说过：海瑞来兴国后，装做一个算命的，花言巧语与全县的十八个寨的农民起义领袖结拜兄弟，后来，请他们来吃酒，把他们灌醉了，海瑞就把他们杀了。并在县衙门的楼上挂起十八个红灯，表示庆祝“胜利”，也是对人民的威吓。从这个民间传说告诉我们，人民群众清楚地懂得海瑞是人民的敌人。可吴晗同志偏偏说海瑞是“清官”，什么“站在人民一边”“为民作主”，这不是睁眼说瞎话，大肆歪曲、捏造吗？我们知道，海瑞是镇压农民革命的刽子手，是保护地主利益的忠实走狗。我们劳苦农民群众与地主官僚海瑞有着不共戴天之仇，决不能“合二而一”。
    崔忠让：吴晗说海瑞是“清官”，“为民作主”，给农民“平冤狱”，打官司“站在农民一边”。这是代表地主、绅士说话。只有地主、绅士才叫封建官僚是“清官”。我们劳动人民认为封建官僚没有一个是好的，都是骑在人民头上的罪首。没有一个封建官僚不刮钱、不欺压人民群众的。“衙门八字开，有理无钱莫进来。”海瑞也是如此，那里是“为民作主”，“站在农民一边”呢？！
    万才仁（长冈公社长冈大队社员、贫农、原红军某部连长）：吴晗说海瑞是“清官”，几好几好，我就不相信。我今年六十八岁，一代代传下来，我就没有听说过有什么“清官”。旧社会是无官不贪，不要说是一个知县，就是一个保长，他也仗势欺人，敲诈勒索。蒋经国过去在赣州当“专员”，也说什么反对贪污，自称是“青天”。但他自己就是一个大贪污头子。反对别人贪污，还不是为了自己腰包能装得更满一些。劳动人民还不是一样的受压迫、受剥削。国民党的县官也是一样，进进出出都要坐四人抬的大轿，带上百余人，几十条枪，走到那里都要大摆宴席。他们的钱还不是老百姓的血汗。
