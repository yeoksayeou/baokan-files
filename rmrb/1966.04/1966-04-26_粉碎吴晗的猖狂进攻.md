    Smash Wu Han's Frenzied Attack
              Ying Tianchou
    For thousands of years, recorded history has been the history of class struggle. All exploiting classes interpret history according to their class interests, thereby distorting history. Only with the emergence of Marxism did the proletariat reveal the truth of history for the first time. Some old history books specifically record historical events and the words and deeds of historical figures, but they are all invariably controlled and distorted by the viewpoints of the exploiting classes. Therefore, it is necessary to use the Marxist method of class analysis to clear away this dense fog.
    The "History of the Ming Dynasty" was compiled by many feudal literati gathered by three emperors of the Qing Dynasty. It beautifies feudal rulers and slanders the working people everywhere. The "Biography of Hai Rui" is no exception. The biography begins by writing that when Hai Rui "went to the capital for the provincial examination, he immediately submitted to the emperor the 'Plan for Pacifying the Li People,' wanting to open roads and establish counties to pacify the homeland. Those with discernment praised him." Hai Rui schemed for the feudal dynasty to suppress the people, and the historians praised him. This is openly standing on the side of the feudal ruling class. Hai Rui implemented the Single Whip Law, requiring large landlords to return some land and punishing individual village officials. In essence, this was merely to deceive the people in order to increase the dynasty's income and consolidate feudal rule. It only reflected that the feudal ruling group, in addition to the means of "killing the chicken to get the eggs," also had the means of "raising the chicken to get the eggs," while the essence of "getting the eggs" was the same. However, past historians, starting from the standpoint of maintaining feudal rule, concealed the class essence and falsely claimed that it was for the poor. Today's Comrade Wu Han also follows behind them, similarly portraying Hai Rui as a figure who was "deeply attached to the people like fish and water" and "shared weal and woe" with them, writing the peasants as weak, ignorant, meek, and unresisting fools, writing that the peasants only needed to rely on the feudal "upright official" lords to "have plenty of food and clothing" and "enjoy eternal peace." And the most essential thing in history at that time, that is, the fact that peasant uprisings broke out everywhere under the severe oppression of demands, chases, knockings, and excessive taxation, is not mentioned at all. Where is there even a little bit in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" that can be said to conform to historical truth?
    Why does Wu Han distort history in this way, obliterate the revolutionary spirit of the working people, and praise the "great achievements" of exploiting class elements? This cannot but be an attack by exploiting class ideology on the proletarian ideological position in the fields of literature, art, and history. There is giving and taking; it is impolite not to reciprocate. We must thoroughly smash this kind of attack.

    粉碎吴晗的猖狂进攻
              应天仇
    几千年以来，有文字记载的历史，都是阶级斗争的历史。一切剥削阶级都是根据他们的阶级利益来解释历史，从而歪曲了历史的。只是到了马克思主义产生，才由无产阶级第一次揭示了历史的真实。旧史书有一部分是具体地记载了历史事件和历史人物的言行的，但又无一不被剥削阶级的观点所驾驭所歪曲。因此，必须用马克思主义阶级分析的方法，才能拨开这个迷天大雾。
    《明史》就是清朝三代皇帝纠集许多封建文人编修的，它处处美化封建统治者，诬蔑劳动人民。《海瑞传》也绝不例外。传文开始，写海瑞“举乡试入都，即伏阙上‘平黎策’欲开道置县以靖乡土。识者壮之。”海瑞为封建皇朝筹谋划策镇压人民，编史者赞颂，这是公开站在封建统治立场上了。海瑞行一条鞭法，要大地主退回部分土地，要惩治个别乡官，其实质不过是为了欺骗人们以增加皇朝收入，巩固封建统治。不过是反映了封建统治集团除去“杀鸡取蛋”的手段外，还有个“养鸡取蛋”的手段，而“取蛋”的本质是共同的。可是，过去的编史者从维护封建统治的立场出发，掩盖了阶级实质，伪说成那是为了贫民的。今天的吴晗同志也跟在他们后面，把海瑞同样地描写成和农民“鱼水情深”、“患难与共”的人物，把农民写成了软弱、愚昧、逆来顺受、不思反抗的愚氓，写成农民只要靠了封建的“清官”大老爷就可以“丰衣足食”“永享太平”。而当时历史最本质的东西，即农民在追呼敲扑、科敛横溢的严重压榨下，到处爆发农民起义的事实，只字不见了。《海瑞罢官》那里还有一点点称得上是符合历史真实的呢？
    吴晗为什么这样歪曲历史，抹煞劳动人民的革命精神，歌颂剥削阶级分子的“丰功伟绩”？这不能不是在文艺、历史领域中剥削阶级思想向无产阶级思想阵地的进攻。有来有往，来而不往非礼也，我们必须彻底粉碎这种进攻。
