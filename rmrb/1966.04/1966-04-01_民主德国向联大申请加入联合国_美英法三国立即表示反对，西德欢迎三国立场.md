    Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, March 31st: The German Democratic Republic recently formally submitted an application requesting to join the United Nations.

    The Berlin newspapers published on March 14th the application and statement from the Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, Walter Ulbricht, to the UN Secretary-General on February 28th, as well as a memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic regarding this issue. In the application, Ulbricht requested the admission of the German Democratic Republic as a member of the United Nations.

    As soon as this request was made, it was immediately opposed by Western countries led by the United States. The representatives of the United States, Britain, and France to the United Nations issued a joint statement on March 3rd, claiming that the German Democratic Republic "is not a country and has no right to be admitted into this international organization (referring to the United Nations)." The West German government publicly welcomed the joint statement issued by the United States, Britain, and France on March 4th.

    民主德国向联大申请加入联合国
    美英法三国立即表示反对，西德欢迎三国立场
    新华社柏林三十一日电　德意志民主共和国最近正式提出申请，要求加入联合国。
    柏林报纸三月十四日公布了德意志民主共和国国务委员会主席乌布利希二月二十八日致联合国秘书长的申请书和声明，以及德意志民主共和国外交部关于这个问题的备忘录。乌布利希在申请书中要求接纳德意志民主共和国为联合国会员国。
    这个要求一经提出，就立即遭到以美国为首的西方国家的反对。美、英、法三国驻联合国代表三月三日发表联合声明，竟宣称德意志民主共和国“不是一个国家，无权被接纳进入这个国际组织（指联合国）。”西德政府三月四日公开表示欢迎美、英、法三国发表的联合声明。
