    "Collective Household" is a form of collective team insertion for educated youth going to the countryside. This form allows educated youth who go to the countryside to live, study, and work together, which is conducive to overcoming difficulties in life, engaging in scientific and cultural activities, and strengthening the leadership and education of the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    Collective Household
    --A form of collective team insertion for urban educated youth going to the countryside--

    Since July 1962, the No. 2 Middle School in Changchun City has had twenty-seven junior and senior high school graduates who formed a collective household to settle down in Peijiatun Production Team, Huangjin Commune, Nongan County, Jilin Province. For more than three years, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, they have undergone training and testing in the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside and have made remarkable achievements. After going to the countryside, one person joined the Party, eight joined the Communist Youth League, and eleven served as cadres in production brigades and teams. They are an advanced collective of the county and province.

    The Collective Household is Home for Educated Youth Going to the Countryside

    Youth going to the countryside used to live in cities for a long time and are not familiar with the countryside. Therefore, organizing youth to go to the countryside in the form of collective households, where they live, study, and work together in a lively manner, suits their wishes. At the same time, relying on the collective makes it easier to overcome difficulties in life and help educated youth adapt to the rural environment more quickly and overcome the “life” hurdle.

    After going to the countryside, they did not know how to cook or manage household affairs. The wife of the production team leader taught them how to cook and helped with household chores. Some commune members even sent them salt and soy sauce. With the help of the production team, they gradually strengthened their life management, established a "Household Committee," and elected a head and deputy head, as well as labor, study, life, finance, and cultural and sports committee members. They established various systems for labor, study, life, and finance. They held a "family" meeting once a month to discuss life issues, exchange opinions, and conduct criticism and self-criticism. The collective household's money, grain, and goods were kept by designated personnel, and accounts were announced monthly. Household chores were divided up. They could eat hot meals on time every day, and after work, they could squeeze out time to study, participate in social work, and engage in cultural and sports activities.

    This collective is full of the spirit of unity and friendship. When the female youth cooked, the male youth ran to fetch water; when the male youth's clothes were torn or dirty, the female youth quietly took them to sew and wash. Some of the hard work was taken on by the male youth. If anyone had a headache or fever, everyone gathered around, one handing soup, the other giving medicine.

    The collective household is the home for educated youth going to the countryside. After a period of training, some people get married and live separately, and some enlist in the army. As the firstcomers left, new people kept coming in, batch after batch. They Grow in Class Struggle and Production Struggle

    Educated youth living in the collective can be better organized to study Chairman Mao's works, have a sound democratic life, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and promote the continuous political and ideological growth of each member. At the same time, it is easier for the Party, the Communist Youth League, and the poor and lower-middle peasants to strengthen their leadership and education.

    When they first went to the countryside, it was just in time for the autumn plowing. At the end of the hottest part of summer, the sorghum fields were hot and stuffy. It was stuffy just standing in them, let alone working. After a day's work, their backs ached, and a struggle unfolded in the youth's minds: should they persevere to the end, or give up halfway? Communist Youth League member Guo Fengxia saw what everyone was thinking and said to her companions, "We have all come to build a new socialist countryside. We must not retreat when we see difficulties. We should persevere to the end." With the help of the old commune members and each other, they studied diligently and practiced hard, gradually learning farm work such as threshing, grass cutting, and firewood cutting, and overcoming the labor "hurdle."

    The following spring, Peijiatun encountered an unusual drought. The youth of the collective household, together with the commune members, carried water to rush the planting. As soon as one difficulty had passed, another came head-on. Just as the millet was heading and the sorghum was jointing, Peijiatun was hit by a major flood that had not been seen in decades. At this time, the collective household organized everyone to study "Serve the People" and clearly recognized that "When our comrades are in difficulty, they must see achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." The secretary of the commune Party committee also came to the collective household and said to them, "Disaster is not terrible. What is terrible is bowing your head in the face of disaster." He encouraged the youth to strengthen their confidence and overcome difficulties. Chairman Mao's teachings and the Party committee's encouragement brightened the youth's hearts and gave them more energy. They rolled up their trousers, carried iron shovels, and joined the commune members in the intense flood drainage struggle. They fought for more than half a month, dug three drainage ditches, recovered more than 40,000 catties of grain from the disaster, and reduced the disaster situation. Due to the disaster, some difficulties arose in life. They held a "family" meeting to study ways to live frugally and overcome the famine. They said, "If the land is waterlogged, our minds cannot be waterlogged. Under the leadership of the Party, we must see achievements, not be frightened by difficulties, and accumulate energy to meet newer and greater combat tasks."

    They lead a sound democratic life. In daily life, they pay attention to grasping living ideas, discovering ideological trends in their partners in a timely manner, and helping them improve their understanding and correct their shortcomings through individual work.

    The local Party, Communist Youth League organizations, and poor and lower-middle peasants care about the political growth of these young people and help them establish the right roots. In the winter of the same year that the collective household went to the countryside, they were organized to participate in class struggle, visit class education exhibition halls, and old poor peasants told them their family history, giving them a profound class education. They established deep class feelings with the poor and lower-middle peasants. They treat the poor and lower-middle peasants as their own relatives, and the poor and lower-middle peasants treat them as their own children.

    Educated Youth Can Accomplish Great Things in the Countryside

    After educated youth go to the countryside, living together, they are both a scientific research group and a cultural activity station, which can better exert the special skills of educated youth and contribute to the three great revolutionary movements in the countryside.

    Peijiatun is a famous low-lying, waterlogged area, and the soil has a high alkali content. The masses say that this place is "impenetrable when dry and impenetrable when waterlogged." In the spring of 1964, the youth of the collective household responded to the Party's call to engage in scientific experiments in a big way, and together with cadres and old peasants, formed five scientific experiment groups for rice, mixed planting, potatoes, seed fields, and gardens, and carried out eight scientific experiments on twelve *mu* of land, all of which achieved good results.

    In April 1964, they used land beds to cultivate a pond of rice seedlings, and drought occurred soon after transplanting. They carried water from large pits to fight the drought, but when the pits were dried up, the seedlings could not be saved. This experiment failed. At this time, some people were in low spirits and lost confidence in continuing the experiment. In response to this kind of thinking, the collective household organized everyone to study "On Practice." Chairman Mao said: "After people experience failure, they also learn lessons from failure and correct their thinking to suit the laws of the outside world, and people can turn failure into victory." Chairman Mao's words pointed out the direction for them and untied the ideological knots. According to Chairman Mao's instructions, they seriously summed up the experience and lessons, and with the support of the poor and lower-middle peasants, they started a new experiment. When building small pond dikes, problems occurred again: the test dikes were built dry, and after water was released, they collapsed. They changed to building dikes with water, but they did not build them high enough, and the water came. At this time, they asked the old peasants for advice. They adopted the method of building half a section, stopping for a while, letting the water seep in, and then adding height, which was indeed successful. This incident had a great educational effect on them, making them further understand that scientific experiments, like any other work, must rely on the masses in order to achieve success. They said, "When we first came down, we felt that our talents were wasted. After we started doing it, we felt that we lacked talent." While conducting experiments, the youth began to study rice cultivation in depth. They successively studied more than 50 related books and materials, and also visited many places, absorbing the experience of various places, and finally succeeded in trial planting rice in alkali-rich, waterlogged land for the first time, allowing the people of Peijiatun to eat rice produced from their own land for the first time.

    Educated youth have their own specialties, and collective life makes it easier for them to make the best of their talents and give full play to their specialties. Some of them go to run farming and reading primary schools, some go to run private schools, some read newspapers and tell stories to the masses, show slideshows, and some publicize scientific knowledge to the masses. They have helped solve the problem of literacy and reading for more than 80 poor and lower-middle peasant commune members and their children.

    Caring for Youth Going to the Countryside in All Aspects of Political Ideology and Life

    In recent years, Changchun No. 2 Middle School has fulfilled its "rear" responsibility to the collective household in Peijiatun in the spirit of being responsible to the end, and has done a lot of work to consolidate the collective household. The school's Party and Communist Youth League organizations conduct education for them in revolutionary ideals, hard work, and learning from the poor and lower-middle peasants. In carrying out education, they run through the red line of revolution, especially targeting the living ideas of youth going to the countryside, and assist local organizations in carrying out ideological work. For example, when students first go to the countryside, they encounter difficulties and their thinking fluctuates, and they waver in their choice of roads, the school helps them improve their confidence and determination to overcome difficulties and take root in the countryside. When they are consolidated, make achievements, and gain the trust of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and some people are a little proud, the school helps them solve the problem of firmly relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants and learning from them forever. When young people have disagreements with each other, they go to help resolve contradictions, strengthen unity, and so on. Changchun No. 2 Middle School, according to the needs of the collective household, provides them with some material support within its capabilities to help them solve specific difficulties. Changchun No. 2 Middle School often conducts education on hard work and frugality for them, asking them to share weal and woe with the masses and not to exceed the living standards of the masses.

    No. 2 Middle School also often works with the parents of students. In addition to doing ideological work for parents before students go to the countryside, after students go to the countryside, they often maintain contact with parents in the spirit of being responsible to the end, and sometimes visit them during the New Year holidays. When the school has a car to go to the collective household, it notifies the parents, and the parents who are willing to go go together. They also take advantage of the opportunity to invite parents to participate in the city's symposiums to educate them. After doing a good job of parental work, the parents in turn do the work of the youth who have gone to the countryside.

    The work of No. 2 Middle School with the collective household was not very clear at the beginning. At that time, they just felt that they should be responsible to the students, but they also felt that it was troublesome. Later, they gradually realized that doing this work not only helped the youth who went to the countryside, but also had an educational effect on the school, and should be done. Three years of practice have proved that the collective household has played a very good role in education, labor, and student placement for the school.

    The collective household is a resettlement base and has become the main channel for sending students to the countryside. Now another collective household has been added near the Peijiatun Production Team. From 1962 to last year, the school successively sent 41 youth to the two collective households, plus more than 80 people who went to the mountains and inserted themselves into teams as individuals. Not only do students go to the countryside, but some parents also move to the countryside to help young people manage their lives and manage household affairs.

    The collective household is also a labor base. In order to strengthen the education of students in school, the school has organized more than 200 teachers and students to the collective household for short-term labor training in recent years, which has achieved good results.

    The collective household is also an education base. The role of the collective household in this regard is more obvious. In recent years, school leaders have organized teachers and students in school and youth who have gone to the countryside to contact each other and educate each other through the method of "sending people to go and inviting them back." They have successively organized 1,040 people to visit the collective household and visit the poor and lower-middle peasants. The 1964 graduate representative conference was held in the collective household. Every year, during the New Year holidays and the concentrated education stage for graduating students, the youth who have gone to the countryside are invited back to give reports. They also held an exhibition room of the deeds of the youth who went to the countryside and printed farming diaries, which had good results.

    The collective household also educated the teachers. In the past, a few teachers did not have a sufficient understanding of the significance of students going to the countryside, and they were skeptical about whether they could achieve anything by going to the countryside. After many visits, many teachers were educated. In the face of the facts, they realized the correctness of the Party's educational policy and that the educated youth going to the countryside was a revolutionary action and a path to realizing the revolutionization of youth. Now school leaders and teachers all feel that the collective household has played a positive role in promoting the ideological revolutionization of teachers and promoting teaching reform.

    “集体户”，是知识青年下乡集体插队的一种形式。这种形式，可以使下乡知识青年生活、学习、劳动在一起，有利于克服生活上的困难，有利于从事科学文化活动，有利于党、团组织和贫下中农对他们加强领导和教育。
    集体户
    ——城市知识青年下乡集体插队的一种形式——
    从一九六二年七月起，长春市第二中学先后有二十七名初、高中毕业生，组成集体户，到吉林省农安县黄金公社裴家屯生产队安家落户。三年多来，在毛泽东思想的哺育下，他们在农村三大革命运动中经受了锻炼和考验，做出了显著成绩。下乡后，有一人入了党，八人入了团，十一人担任了生产大队、小队的干部，他们是县和省的先进集体。
    集体户是下乡知识青年的家
    下乡的青年过去长期生活在城市，不熟悉农村，所以，用集体户这种形式组织青年下乡，他们生活、学习、劳动在一起，热热闹闹，正适合他们的愿望。同时，依靠集体，便于克服生活上的困难，帮助知识青年更快地适应农村的环境，度过生活“关”。
    下乡以后，他们不会做饭，不会料理家务，生产队长的老伴，就教他们做饭，帮助料理家务。有的社员还送来了盐酱。在生产队的帮助下，他们逐渐地加强了生活管理，成立了“户委会”，选出了正副户长和劳动、学习、生活、财务、文体委员。建立了劳动、学习、生活和财务等各项制度。每月召开一次“家庭”会议，研究生活问题，互相交换意见，开展批评与自我批评。集体户的钱、粮、物都有专人保管，按月公布账目。家务劳动，分工负担。每天都可以按时吃到热饭热菜，劳动之余，还能挤出时间学习，参加社会工作和文体活动。
    在这个集体里，充满着团结友爱精神。女青年做饭时，男青年跑去挑水；男青年衣服破了，脏了，女青年就悄悄地拿去缝好、洗干净。有些累活，男青年抢着干。哪个人有个头痛脑热，大家都围在身边，这个端汤，那个送药。
    集体户是下乡知识青年的家，经过一段时间的锻炼，有的人结婚，出去单独生活，有的人应征入伍。先来的人走了，新人又不断地进来，一批接一批。在阶级斗争生产斗争中成长
    下乡知识青年生活在集体里，能够更好地组织学习毛主席著作，有健全的民主生活，开展批评与自我批评，促进每个成员在政治上、思想上不断成长。同时，更便于党、团组织和贫下中农对他们加强领导和教育。
    他们刚下乡时，正赶上放秋垄，三伏末尾，高粱地里又闷又热，别说干活，在里面站着也闷的慌。劳动一天，累得腰酸腿疼，青年们思想里展开了斗争：是坚持到底，还是半途而废？团员郭凤霞看出了大家的心思，她向同伴们说：“我们都是为了建设社会主义新农村来的，不能见着困难就退，应该坚持到底。”在老社员和大家互相帮助下，勤学苦练，逐渐地学会了打场、打草、割柴等农活，攻下了劳动“关”。
    第二年春天，裴家屯遇到了少有的旱象。集体户的青年和社员一起，担水抢种。一个困难刚刚过去，又一个困难迎面而来。正当谷子秀穗，高粱拔节的时候，裴家屯又遭遇了几十年未有的大水灾。就在这个时候，集体户组织大家学习了《为人民服务》，明确认识到“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”公社党委书记也来到集体户，对他们说：“受灾并不可怕，可怕的是在灾害面前低头。”他勉励青年坚定信心，战胜困难。毛主席的教导，党委的鼓励，使青年们心里亮堂了，干劲足了。他们卷起裤腿，扛起铁锹，和社员一起投入紧张的排涝斗争中去。他们奋战了半个多月，挖了三条排水沟，从灾害中，夺回四万多斤粮食，减轻了灾情。由于受灾，生活上出现了一些困难。他们召开了“家庭”会议，研究勤俭过日子，战胜灾荒的办法。他们说：“地涝了，我们的思想不能涝。在党的领导下，我们要看到成绩，不要被困难吓倒，要积蓄精力，迎接更新更大的战斗任务。”
    他们过着健全的民主生活。在日常生活中，他们注意抓活思想，及时发现伙伴中的思想苗头，通过个别工作，帮助提高认识，改正缺点。
    当地的党、团组织和贫下中农，关心这些年轻人政治上的成长，帮助他们扎正根子。在集体户下乡的当年冬天，就组织他们参加阶级斗争，参观阶级教育展览馆，老贫农向他们讲家史，使他们受到了深刻的阶级教育。他们和贫下中农建立了深厚的阶级感情。他们把贫下中农当成自己的亲人，贫下中农更把他们当成自己的子女一样看待。
    知识青年在农村大有作为
    知识青年下乡以后，生活在一起，既是科学研究组，又是文化活动站，能够更好地发挥知识青年的特长，在农村三大革命运动中贡献力量。
    裴家屯是个有名的涝洼地，土质含碱很大。群众说这个地方“旱了刀枪不入，涝了滴水不漏”。一九六四年春天，集体户青年响应党的大搞科学实验的号召，同干部、老农结合，组成了水稻、混种、土豆、种子田和园林五个科学试验小组，在十二垧地上，进行了八项科学实验，都取得了较好的成绩。
    一九六四年四月，他们用陆床育了一池子稻苗，插秧不久就出现了干旱现象，他们从大坑里挑水抗旱，坑挑干了，小苗也没救过来。这次试验失败了。这时，有人情绪低落，对继续试验失去了信心。集体户针对这种思想，组织大家学习《实践论》。毛主席说：“人们经过失败之后，也就从失败取得教训，改正自己的思想使之适合于外界的规律性，人们就能变失败为胜利”。毛主席的这段话，给他们指出了前进的方向，解开了思想疙瘩。他们按照毛主席的指示，认真总结了经验教训，在贫下中农的支持下，他们开始了新的试验。在打小池埂子的时候，又发生了问题：试验旱打，放水后，水一冲就垮。又改水打，可是没有打够高度，水就来了。这时，他们就向老农请教。采取了垒半截，停一停，渗渗水，再加高的办法，果然成功了。这件事对他们教育很大，使他们进一步懂得了搞科学实验和干任何一项工作一样，必须处处依靠群众，才能获得成功。他们说：“刚下来的时候，感到屈材，干起来后，感到缺才了。”在搞试验的同时，青年们开始深入研究水稻栽培学。他们先后学习了五十多本有关书籍和资料，还参观访问了许多地方，吸取了各地的经验，终于破天荒地在碱性很大的涝洼地里试种成功水稻，使裴家屯人第一次吃到自己地里产出来的大米。
    知识青年各有特长，集体生活便于他们各尽其能，发挥特长。他们有的去办耕读小学，有的去办民校，有的给群众读报、讲故事、放幻灯，有的向群众宣传科学知识。他们帮助解决了八十多名贫下中农社员和他们的子女识字读书的问题。
    从政治思想、生活等各方面关心下乡青年
    几年来，长春二中对裴家屯集体户，本着负责到底的精神，尽了“后方”的责任，为集体户的巩固做了许多工作。学校党、团组织对他们进行革命理想、艰苦奋斗和向贫下中农学习的教育。在进行教育的时候，贯串着革命这一条红线，特别是针对下乡青年的活思想，协助当地组织进行思想工作。如学生刚下乡时，遇到困难，思想波动，对自己选择的道路发生动摇时，学校就帮助他们提高克服困难，扎根农村的信心和决心。当他们巩固下来，做出成绩，得到贫下中农的信赖，部分人有点骄傲的时候，学校就帮助他们解决坚定依靠贫下中农，永远向贫下中农学习的问题。青年人互相闹意见时，他们就去帮助解决矛盾，加强团结，等等。长春二中根据集体户的需要，在力所能及的情况下，在物质上也给他们一些支援，帮助他们解决具体困难。长春二中经常向他们进行艰苦奋斗、勤俭过日子的教育，要他们和群众同甘共苦，不能超出群众的生活水平。
    二中还经常向学生的家长做工作。学校除了在学生下乡前，对家长做思想工作外，在学生下乡后，还本着负责到底的精神，经常和家长取得联系，年节有时还去探望，学校有车去集体户时，就通知家长，家长愿意去的一同去。他们还利用时机请家长参加市里召开的座谈会，让他们受教育。做好了家长工作，家长反过来又做了下乡青年的工作。
    二中做集体户的工作，并不是一开始就十分清楚的。那时，只是觉得应该对学生负责，但又感到麻烦。后来，逐步认识到做这项工作不仅是帮助了下乡青年，而且对学校也有教育作用，应该去做。经过三年的实践证明，集体户对学校来说，在教育、劳动、安置学生方面，都发挥了很好的作用。
    集体户是安置基地，已成为输送学生下乡的主要渠道。现在又在裴家屯生产队附近增加了一个集体户。从一九六二年到去年，学校先后向两个集体户送去四十一名青年，加上上山和单身插队的已经输送八十多人。不仅学生下乡，有的家长也跟着迁到农村落户，帮助青年管理生活，操持家务。
    集体户也是劳动基地。学校为了加强在校学生的教育，几年来组织了二百多名师生到集体户短期劳动锻炼，收到良好效果。
    集体户又是教育基地。集体户在这方面的作用比较明显。几年来，学校领导通过“派人去，请回来”的办法，组织在校师生和下乡青年接触，互相受教育。他们先后组织一千零四十人次，前往集体户参观和访问贫下中农。一九六四年的毕业生代表会，就是在集体户召开的。每逢年节和应届毕业生集中教育阶段，都请下乡青年回来做报告。他们还举办了下乡青年事迹展览室，印发了务农日记，效果很好。
    集体户也教育了教师。有少数教师过去对学生下乡的意义认识不足，对下乡是否有所作为，持怀疑态度，经多次参观访问后，许多教师受到了教育。他们在事实面前，认识到党的教育方针的正确性，认识到知识青年下乡是革命行动，是实现青年革命化的道路。现在学校领导和老师们都感到，集体户在促进教师思想革命化，促进教学改革上起了积极作用。
