    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 1st – Sasaki Kozo, Chairman of the Japan Socialist Party, raised urgent questions to Japanese Prime Minister Sato in the plenary session of the House of Representatives on the evening of March 31st, sternly condemning the Sato government's unreasonable refusal of entry to the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, and pointing out that it is the United States, not China, that is interfering in Japan's internal affairs.

    Sasaki said that normalizing relations between Japan and China and promoting Japan-China friendship are of decisive significance for ensuring Japan's security and safeguarding peace in Asia. He pointed out that the Japan Socialist Party invited the Chinese delegation to visit Japan based on this position, and therefore received enthusiastic support from all walks of life.

    Sasaki sternly refuted the Sato government's argument that China was "interfering in internal affairs," which it fabricated in order to refuse entry to the Chinese delegation. He questioned: "The United States is sending a large number of troops to South Vietnam and bombing the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. How can the Japan Socialist Party and the Chinese delegation's criticism of US imperialist policies be considered interference in Japan's internal affairs?" Sasaki cited the fact that the United States uses Okinawa as a take-off base for B52 bombers bombing Vietnam, and that the United States arbitrarily slanders and interferes with Japanese newspapers. He pointed out that it is US imperialism that is interfering in Japan's internal affairs. To eliminate interference in internal affairs, US imperialism must be eliminated.

    Sasaki Kozo also refuted the nonsense spread by the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice, and others, that "allowing the Chinese delegation to enter the country would harm national interests." He said: "The Sato government's actions to prevent the Chinese delegation from visiting Japan, attempting to cause Japan-China relations to regress significantly, are precisely what harms Japan's national interests."

    Sasaki stated that the Socialist Party firmly demands that the Japanese government revoke its decision to refuse entry to the Chinese delegation.

    In answering Sasaki's questions, Sato Eisaku refused to accept the Socialist Party's demands, adhered to a hostile position towards China, wantonly slandered the friendly exchanges between the people of China and Japan, and tried his best to defend the aggressive policies of US imperialism. He shamelessly insisted that "the United States' actions in Vietnam are supported by countries around the world."

    The opposition party members responded to Sato's slander and libel with boos and shouted: "Tell these words to the United States!"

    佐佐木更三委员长在众院向佐藤提出严正质问
    严厉谴责佐藤政府拒绝我代表团入境
    新华社东京一日电　日本社会党委员长佐佐木更三三月三十一日晚上在众议院全体会议上向日本首相佐藤提出紧急质问，严厉谴责佐藤政府无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境，并且指出不是中国而是美国在干涉日本的内政。
    佐佐木说，促使日本和中国邦交正常化，推进日中友好，对确保日本的安全和保卫亚洲的和平具有决定的意义。他指出，日本社会党就是本着这样的立场邀请中国的代表团来访问日本的，因此受到各阶层人士的热烈支持。
    佐佐木严厉驳斥了佐藤政府为拒绝中国的代表团入境所制造的所谓中国“干涉内政”的论调，他质问道：“美国正在向南越派遣大量军队、轰炸越南民主共和国。日本社会党和中国的代表团批判美帝国主义的政策，怎么就是干涉日本内政？”佐佐木举出美国利用冲绳作为轰炸越南的B52轰炸机的起飞基地、美国恣意对日本报纸进行诽谤和干涉等事实。他指出，干涉日本内政的正是美帝国主义。要排除干涉内政，应当排除美帝国主义。
    佐佐木更三还驳斥了日本外务大臣、法务大臣等人发表的“允许中国代表团入境危害国家利益”的胡言乱语。他说：“佐藤政府阻止中国的代表团访问日本，企图使日中关系大步后退，这种做法才正是危害日本的国家利益的。”
    佐佐木表示社会党坚决要求日本政府取消拒绝中国代表团入境的决定。
    佐藤荣作在回答佐佐木的质询时，拒绝接受社会党的要求，坚持敌视中国的立场，大肆诽谤中日两国人民之间的友好交流，并且竭力为美帝国主义的侵略政策辩解。他厚颜无耻地硬说“美国在越南的行动受到世界各国的支持”。
    对佐藤的这种诬蔑诽谤，反对党议员们报之以嘘声，并且喊道：“把这些话说给美国去听吧！”
