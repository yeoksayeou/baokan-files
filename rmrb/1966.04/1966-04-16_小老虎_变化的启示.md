    The Enlightenment from the Changes of "Little Tiger"
    Fang Tianbai
    Everything in the world is changing, and people are also changing all the time.
    Drilling Team 1205 is a "Five-Good Banner Team" in Daqing Oilfield. There was a worker in this team named Xu Wanming, who was particularly motivated, and everyone called him "Little Tiger". In 1963, the team's leadership neglected politics, and "Little Tiger's" morale gradually declined, and he became backward. Later, the team leadership re-emphasized politics, and Xu Wanming once again became "Little Tiger". Why did such a big change happen in less than a year?
    This is because there are two kinds of thoughts fighting in the mind. Someone has made a good analogy for this kind of struggle: like a tug-of-war. Tug-of-war is calm on the surface, but fierce in reality. Both sides are vying for that rope with all their strength. The ideological struggle is also like this. The proletarian ideology wants to pull this rope over, while the non-proletarian ideology wants to pull it over, and there is no peace for a moment. The rope in the mind is none other than the yardstick people use to guide their thoughts and actions. Taking the proletarian stand and viewpoint as the yardstick for work and life enables one to be unafraid of hardship and death, and to be as fearless as a little tiger. Conversely, if non-proletarian ideology gains the upper hand, one's mental outlook will change drastically, becoming timid and short-sighted. Naturally, in Drilling Team 1205, changes like those of Comrade Xu Wanming are more prominent. But from the fact that this team lost its "banner" due to neglecting politics, and then re-entered the advanced ranks by re-emphasizing politics, it can be seen that there may be quite a few people who have this kind of change, but the degree of change is different.
    When production began to decline, the cadres of this team also immediately looked for reasons. After searching and searching, they found "the derrick is biased, the drill pipe is bent, the sand is not cleaned up, and the drum is not round enough", but they did not find the changes in people's minds. Later, under the leadership of the Party, they seriously summarized their experiences and lessons, and only then did they find the "key link" of class struggle. From then on, not only were the problems of derricks, drill pipes, sand, drums, etc., readily solved, but also the first high-quality model well in the entire oilfield was immediately drilled. It's really like the saying: where you lose it, you have to look for it.
    Class struggle is an objective existence, and it does not shift according to people's will. Class struggle in society is bound to be reflected in the revolutionary ranks and people's ideological field. Raise one key link and a hundred items will fall into place. Firmly grasp the "key link" of class struggle, always put politics in the forefront, and make everyone like a little tiger, and there will be no battle that cannot be won. If you can't grasp this "key link", even if you make a thousand or ten thousand measures, and find a thousand or ten thousand reasons, you still cannot improve production and work. Doesn't the experience and lessons of Drilling Team 1205 profoundly illustrate this principle?
    The struggle between two classes, two roads, and two ideologies is long-term. Where there is struggle, there is change, and the important issue is which direction the change is heading. Consciously moving in the direction of proletarian revolutionization, changing a little today and a little tomorrow, can achieve this "ization". Lacking this kind of consciousness and unremitting effort will give the enemy in ideology an opportunity to take advantage of, and even be "pulled over". Therefore, one must be vigilant at all times in order to continuously move forward.

    “小老虎”变化的启示
    方天白
    世界上的万事万物都是在变的，人也是时时刻刻在变的。
    一二○五钻井队是大庆油田的“五好标杆队”。这个队有个工人叫许万明，干劲特别足，大家叫他“小老虎”。一九六三年，队的领导忽视了政治，“小老虎”情绪逐渐低落，变得落后了。以后，队领导重新突出政治，许万明又重新变为“小老虎”。在不到一年的时间内，为什么会发生这样大的变化呢？
    这是因为脑子里有两种思想在斗争的缘故。这种斗争，有人做过很好的比喻：象拔河一样。拔河，表面平静，其实激烈，双方都以全力争夺那根绳子。思想斗争也是这样。无产阶级思想要把这根绳子拔过来，非无产阶级思想则想把它拔过去，是没有一时一刻的安宁的。脑子里的这根绳子不是别的，就是人们用来指导思想和行动的准绳。以无产阶级的立场、观点作为工作和生活的准绳，就能够一不怕苦，二不怕死，象小老虎一样无畏。相反，如果让非无产阶级思想占了上风，人的精神面貌就会立即大变，变得畏首畏尾，目光短浅。自然，在一二○五钻井队，象许万明同志这样的变化，是比较突出的。但从这个队由于忽视政治而丢掉了“标杆”，以后重新突出政治又跨进了先进行列的情况来看，可知有这种变化的人，也许并不很少，不过变化的程度不同罢了。
    这个队的干部在生产开始下降时，也曾马上找原因。找来找去，却是“井架偏，钻杆弯，砂子没捞净，滚筒不够圆”，就是没有找到人们脑子里的变化。以后在党的领导下，认真总结经验教训，方才把阶级斗争这条“纲”找到了。从此，不但井架、钻杆、砂子、滚筒等等问题都迎刃而解，而且马上打出了全油田第一口质量全优样板井。真象俗话所说的：在哪里丢掉的，还得往哪里去找。
    阶级斗争是客观存在，它是不以人的意志为转移的。社会上的阶级斗争必然要反映到革命队伍和人们的思想领域中来。举一纲而万目张。紧紧抓住阶级斗争这条“纲”，永远突出政治，使每个人都象小老虎一样，就没有打不赢的仗。抓不住这条“纲”，就是订一千一万条措施，找一千一万条原因，也仍然不能把生产和工作搞上去。一二○五钻井队的经验教训，不是十分深刻地说明了这个道理吗？
    两个阶级、两条道路、两种思想的斗争是长期的。有斗争就有变化，重要的问题是朝着什么方向变。自觉地朝着无产阶级革命化的方向，今天变一点，明天变一点，才能达到这个“化”。缺乏这种自觉和坚持不懈的努力，就会给思想上的敌人以可乘之机，甚至被“拉了过去”。因此，必须时时警惕，才能不断前进。
