    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 5th -- The 1966 National Table Tennis Championships opened in Shanghai today.
    Nearly 20,000 people watched the first stage of the men's and women's team round-robin matches in three stadiums (gymnasiums) today. They not only enthusiastically applauded the superb skills of the famous players from various regions but also gave equally warm applause to the daring and fighting "little tiger" style of the rising stars from various regions.
    Because many newcomers from various regions bravely took on the "heavy burden" of participating in the team competition, a new and encouraging atmosphere appeared on the competition field. When Beijing Team One, the runner-up in the men's team event at last year's Second National Games, competed against the 25th-ranked Hunan team, Hu Yunmin (20 years old), Zhan Dajin (17 years old), and Jiang Liuyuan (16 years old) from Hunan, facing world champion Zhuang Zedong, as well as Guo Zhonggong, Han Zhongti and other strong players, carried forward the revolutionary spirit and attacked fiercely. Under the "impact" of the newcomers, Zhuang Zedong and others also played at a very high level. Hu Yunmin, from the Hunan team, who could use both forehand and backhand to initiate attacks and smash, often took the initiative in his match with Zhuang Zedong, taking the lead in scoring, which won enthusiastic praise from the audience. In the end, Hu Yunmin lost with relatively close scores of 14-21 and 17-21. The Hunan team lost to Beijing Team One with a score of zero to five. After the game, Zhuang Zedong happily praised the Hunan players for playing fiercely and having a good style; at the same time, he also sincerely pointed out the technical shortcomings of the Hunan players, which encouraged them. In the match between Shanghai Women's Team Three and Beijing Women's Team One, there was also a wonderful scene of newcomers not being afraid of strong opponents. Lin Fumei, a newcomer from Shanghai, won against the famous player Li Li after three rounds of a seesaw battle, with a final score of two to one.
    Players from all over the country highlighted politics, and they went all out in the first day of the competition. Several games were very closely contested. After five fierce sets, the Shaanxi team, which was ranked 22nd in the women's team event at the Second National Games, won against the Hunan team, which was ranked 20th. Jiangsu Team One and Heilongjiang Team, participating in the men's team competition, defeated Guizhou Team and Qinghai Team, which were ranked 14th and 20th respectively in the men's team event at the Second National Games, with close scores of 5-3 and 5-4 respectively. The Henan men's team fought tenaciously after falling behind 1-4, and finally won four consecutive sets, defeating Beijing Men's Team Two with a score of 5-4.
    A total of more than 290 male and female athletes from 24 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are participating in this championship, of which about 40 percent are newcomers under the age of seventeen and participating in national competitions for the first time. These newcomers not only participate in the five individual events but also participate in the team competition. This is a rare new phenomenon in the past national table tennis championships, including the Second National Games.
    There are thirty-three men's teams and thirty-five women's teams participating in this team competition. In the first stage, they are all divided into ten groups for a single round-robin tournament. Today, most teams have played once or twice. The first stage of the competition will end tomorrow.
    Before the opening of the championship, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, Liang Guobin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deputy Mayor of Shanghai, and Li Gancheng and Song Richang, Deputy Mayors of Shanghai, met with some of the athletes, coaches, team leaders, and chief referees participating in the championship. Comrade Cao Diqiu also encouraged everyone to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works during the competition, highlight politics, have the motherland in mind, have the world in view, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping, and contribute all their strength to the development and improvement of the motherland's table tennis.

    突出政治发扬比学赶帮超的革命精神
    一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛在上海开幕
    新华社上海五日电　一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛今天在上海揭幕。
    有近两万人分别在三个体育场（馆）观看了今天开始的男、女团体赛第一阶段分组循环赛，他们不仅为各地名手们的精采球艺热烈鼓掌，而且为各地后起之秀敢打敢拼的“小老虎”风格报以同样热烈的掌声。
    由于各地许多新手都勇敢地挑起了参加团体赛的“重担”，比赛场上出现了令人鼓舞的新气象。去年第二届全国运动会男子团体亚军北京一队同第二十五名湖南队比赛时，湖南队二十岁的胡运旻、十七岁的占达津和十六岁的蒋六元，面对世界冠军庄则栋以及郭仲恭、韩忠悌等强手，发扬革命精神，猛攻猛打。庄则栋等在新手们的“冲击”下，也打出了很高水平。湖南队能正反手两面起板扣杀的胡运旻同庄则栋交手时，常常抢先起板赢得主动，得分一度领先，博得观众们的热烈赞扬。最后胡运旻以十四比二十一和十七比二十一的比较接近的比分失利。这场比赛湖南队以零比五输给北京一队。比赛结束后，庄则栋高兴地赞扬湖南选手们打得凶，风格好；同时，也诚恳地指出了湖南选手们技术上的不足之处，使湖南选手们受到了鼓舞。在上海女子三队同北京女子一队的比赛中也出现了新手不畏强手的精采场面。上海的新手林福梅经过三局拉锯战，最后以二比一战胜了名将李莉。
    各地选手突出政治，在第一天的比赛中都全力以赴，好几场比赛打得难分难解。第二届全运会女子团体第二十二名陕西队同第二十名湖南队激战五盘以后，陕西队才获得胜利。参加男子团体赛的江苏一队和黑龙江队，分别以五比三和五比四的接近比分战胜了第二届全运会男子团体第十四名贵州队和第二十名青海队。河南男子队在一比四落后的情况下，顽强奋战，终于连扳四盘，以五比四战胜了北京男子二队。
    这次锦标赛共有二十四个省、市、自治区的二百九十多名男女选手参加，其中十七岁以下和第一次参加全国性比赛的新手约占百分之四十。这些新手不仅参加五个单项比赛，而且参加团体赛，这是包括第二届全运会在内的历届全国乒乓球锦标赛中少见的新景象。
    参加这次团体赛的男子队有三十三个，女子队有三十五个，第一阶段都各分十个组进行单循环赛。今天，绝大部分球队都出场一次或两次。第一阶段比赛将在明天结束。
    锦标赛开幕前，中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市市长曹荻秋，中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市副市长梁国斌，上海市副市长李干成、宋日昌等，会见了参加这次锦标赛的部分运动员、教练员、各队领队和裁判长等。曹荻秋同志并且勉励大家在比赛期间活学活用毛主席著作，突出政治，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，发扬比学赶帮超的革命精神，为祖国乒乓球运动的发展和提高，贡献自己的全部力量。
