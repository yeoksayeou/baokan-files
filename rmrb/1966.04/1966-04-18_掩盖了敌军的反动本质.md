    Masking the Reactionary Essence of the Enemy Army
    Chen Zemin, Company Commander of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
    The film "Siege" masks the anti-people and reactionary essence of the enemy army's generals, conceals the class contradiction between the enemy and us, and goes to great lengths to beautify the enemy.
    Nationalist local warlords like Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen were all executioners who rode roughshod over the people, doing whatever they wanted, and cruelly harming the people. Otherwise, they would not have been able to climb to such high positions. Their history can only be a history of crimes against the Communist Party and the people. The film does not expose their crimes, but instead beautifies them in every way. Even Zheng Hanchen's subordinates robbing the people's grain, the screenwriter exonerates him, because these Nationalist soldiers were really too hungry and had no choice but to rob the people's grain. It was excusable. Moreover, when Zheng Hanchen learned about the grain robbery, he was actually very kind and scolded his subordinates for not robbing, and ordered them to return the grain to the people. Look, Zheng Hanchen is clearly an executioner who opposes the Communist Party and the people, but he is forced to be portrayed as a kind-hearted person who cares about the interests of the people. How is this possible?
    Zhao Chongwu, in the screenwriter's pen, is also a patriotic and people-loving heroic figure. When he was young, he had ambitions - during the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance Against Japan, he made great contributions to the country, was unwilling to fight in the civil war, and cared for his subordinates... and this glorious history was written for Zhao Chongwu. At the same time, the film also beautifies the relationship between enemy officers and soldiers.
    Chairman Mao said that within the Kuomintang army, "there are political differences between officers and soldiers," and the relationship between superiors and subordinates, officers and soldiers is completely one of oppression and being oppressed. Political differences, oppression and being oppressed, will inevitably create contradictions between enemy officers and soldiers, causing resentment and dissatisfaction among soldiers towards their officers. The film completely violates this fact, depicting the relationship between enemy officers and soldiers as so united, so considerate, so intimate, truly like family. When Zheng Hanchen's wife couldn't cross the river, a small soldier immediately diligently wanted to carry her across the river, and said, "Regimental Commander Zheng usually treats the brothers very well, shouldn't we show our respect?" Zhao Chongwu was also willing to endure suffering, discrimination, and exclusion for the sake of his subordinates and the future of more than 10,000 fellow villagers, and was unwilling to give up his military career and return to his hometown. This beautifies the relationship between enemy officers and soldiers.
    The Party teaches us: Never forget class and class struggle. This film does not expose the crimes of the enemy, but instead beautifies them in every way. As a result, after watching it, the audience will only sympathize with the enemy, only blur the class boundaries, and relax their revolutionary vigilance.

    掩盖了敌军的反动本质
    中国人民解放军某部连长　陈泽民
    影片《兵临城下》掩盖了敌军将领的反人民的反动本质，掩盖了敌我之间的阶级矛盾，极力美化了敌人。
    象赵崇武、郑汉臣这样的国民党地方军头子，都是骑在人民头上作威作福、残害人民的刽子手，要不然，他们是爬不到这样高的职位上去的。他们的历史，只能是反共反人民的罪恶史，影片不去揭露他们的罪恶，反而处处加以美化。就连郑汉臣的部下，抢老百姓的粮食这一点点罪行，编剧也为他开脱了，因为这些国民党士兵，实在是饿得没有办法，才抢老百姓的粮食的，情有可原。而且，当抢粮的事被郑汉臣知道以后，郑汉臣居然大发善心，责骂部下不该抢，命令部下把粮食还给老百姓。看，郑汉臣明明是个反共反人民的刽子手，硬要把他说成是关心人民利益的好心肠人，这怎么可能？
    赵崇武，在编剧的笔下也是个爱国爱民的英雄人物。年轻时有抱负——北伐战争和抗日战争时期，为国家立过汗马功劳，不愿打内战，对部下体贴关怀……，并且为赵崇武编写了这段光荣的历史。同时，影片还美化了敌军官兵之间的关系。
    毛主席说，国民党军队“官兵之间在政治上是分歧的”，他们上下之间、官兵之间完全是压迫与被压迫之间的关系。政治上的分歧，压迫与被压迫的关系，必然会造成敌军官兵之间的矛盾，引起士兵对官长的愤恨和不满。影片完全违背了这个事实，把敌军官长和士兵的关系，描写成那样团结一致，那样体贴、亲密，真是亲如家人。当郑汉臣的妻子过不去河的时候，小个子兵马上殷勤地要背她过河，还说什么：“郑团长平时对待弟兄们挺好的，这点心意还不该尽吗？”赵崇武也是为了部下和一万多家乡子弟的前途，宁愿自己受煎熬，受歧视和排挤，也不肯放弃戎马生涯，解甲归田。这就把敌军官长和士兵的关系美化了。
    党教导我们：永远不要忘记阶级和阶级斗争。这部影片，不去揭露敌人的罪恶，还处处加以美化，其结果，观众看了以后，只会同情敌人，只能模糊阶级界限，放松革命警惕性。
