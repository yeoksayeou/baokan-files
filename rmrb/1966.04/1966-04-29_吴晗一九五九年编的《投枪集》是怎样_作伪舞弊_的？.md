How did Wu Han "falsify and commit fraud" in his 1959 compilation, "Collection of Javelins"?

Wu Han said in the preface to "Collection of Javelins" that "the articles collected in this volume, apart from slight modifications in wording in individual places, such as uniformly changing 'Manchu Qing' to 'Qing Dynasty'—basically, there has been no modification." "What is the point of falsifying and committing fraud, and why would one do it!" "It's difficult to start making changes... changing the central argument of the entire piece is impossible." In short, nothing was changed, and "Collection of Javelins" was published in its original form.

Wu Han's words are both right and wrong. They are right because there are some things that Wu Han indeed did not change, refused to change, clung to stubbornly, and insisted on until today. This is his anti-communist, anti-people, counter-revolutionary reactionary bourgeois stance. They are wrong because Wu Han is lying. In order to better peddle his batch of bourgeois black goods and carry out his sinful activities against the Party and socialism, Wu Han "falsified and committed fraud" when compiling "Collection of Javelins," making many major modifications. Which parts were not changed, which parts were changed, and how they were changed—there is much to be said here. We have selected a portion of them and created a collation table, adding some notes in some places to share with readers.

Original Text
"To eradicate corruption, the fundamental solution should be to liberate 'people' from the shackles of the family. Individual life should be independent, and everyone should live for work, with no dependency between people. Change the social organization from family-based to individual-based..."
"On Corruption," Yunnan Daily, November 14, 1943.
"Mirror of History," Life Bookstore, 1946 edition, page 15.

"Collection of Javelins" Text
"To eradicate corruption, the fundamental solution should be to liberate 'people' from the shackles of the family. Individual life should be independent, everyone should live for work, those who do not work shall not eat, with no dependency between people, change the social organization from family-based to individual-based, from a social organization that depends on the family for living and consumption to a productive social organization where everyone works and supports themselves..."
"Collection of Javelins," page 6.

Note: The original purpose is very clear: to establish a capitalist society. This modification retains the capitalist elements while sprinkling in some socialist phrases, making it a hodgepodge. Little does he know that this, in turn, exposes how he is today waving the banner of supporting socialism while continuing to peddle capitalist goods.

"Three hundred years ago, when Emperor Sizong of Ming committed suicide. Li Zicheng went west, and the Qing people, guided by Wu Sangui, occupied Beiping and divided their forces to move south, the Hongguang Emperor, the leader of the Nanjing small court, was embellishing a scene of peace and prosperity,... day and night. His father died an unnatural death, his original wife was scattered and her whereabouts unknown, the monarch committed suicide, and part of the territory was lost to bandits, and part was trampled by foreign soldiers..."
"Three hundred years ago, on the eve of the demise of the Nanjing small court, with Qing troops approaching the north of the Yangtze River, bandits running rampant in Shanxi and Shaanxi, the people impoverished, and the country exhausted, beset by internal and external troubles..."
"Three hundred years ago, when foreign iron hooves were rampaging through Hebei, and the main force of the 'bandits' was swaggering through Shanxi and Henan, the country was broken and the people scattered, and people could not live in peace, Zuo Liangyu, who held hundreds of thousands of troops and dominated the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, remained unmoved, watching the rise and fall. He saw through the chaos of the political situation, as long as he could preserve his strength, and offer a little bribe to the authorities, he would naturally be promoted and ennobled, and his wife and children would be granted official titles. Under this view, he was unwilling to use all his strength to eliminate the 'bandits,' but used all his strength to expand his troops. The government also relied on him to deal with the 'bandits' with all his might, and was unwilling to transfer him to deal with foreign enemies."
"Historical Lessons from Three Hundred Years Ago," 1944, Kunming "Justice Daily" "New Essays" Weekly, issue 9.
"Mirror of History," pages 99, 101.

"Three hundred years ago, when Emperor Sizong of Ming committed suicide, Li Zicheng went west, and the Qing people, guided by the traitor Wu Sangui, occupied Beijing and divided their forces to move south, the Hongguang Emperor, the leader of the Nanjing small court, was embellishing a scene of peace and prosperity, building palaces, preparing officials, hiring singers and dancers, day and night."
"Three hundred years ago, on the eve of the demise of the Nanjing small court, with Qing troops approaching the north of the Yangtze River, the people impoverished, and the country exhausted, beset by internal and external troubles..."
"Three hundred years ago, when foreign iron hooves were trampling through Hebei, the country was broken and the people scattered, and people could not live in peace, Zuo Liangyu, who held hundreds of thousands of troops and dominated the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, remained unmoved, watching the rise and fall. He saw through the chaos of the political situation, as long as he could preserve his strength, and offer a little bribe to the authorities, he would naturally be promoted and ennobled, and his wife and children would be granted official titles. The government also relied on him to deal with the peasant uprising army, and was unwilling to transfer him to deal with foreign enemies."
"Collection of Javelins," pages 24, 25.

Note: From the deleted parts, it can be clearly seen that Wu Han had a clear political purpose in writing this "Historical Lessons from Three Hundred Years Ago": to use "bandits" to insinuate the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which insisted on resisting Japan, and to advise Chiang Kai-shek to use all his strength to eliminate the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. Wu Han's anti-communist, counter-revolutionary face is vividly displayed on paper.

"A characteristic of democratic countries is multi-party politics. Opposition parties have the legitimate right to criticize the government, and conversely, when the opposition party is in power, the ruling party is in the opposition, and it also retains this right. They criticize and accuse each other, and on the one hand, they have the right to raise questions based on facts, and those questioned also have the obligation to provide explanations of the facts. Right and wrong depend on public opinion, and the most important tool for expressing public opinion is the newspaper."
"For decades, we have been putting on airs like monkeys, learning everything from others, and learning everything in a way that looks like something, for example, they have a government, and we have one too, they have a committee, and we have one too,... The difference is that our government is unitary, and our committee is unitary..."
"Newspapers and Public Opinion," 1945.
"Mirror of History," pages 34, 35.

"For decades, we have been putting on airs like monkeys, learning everything from others, and learning everything in a way that looks like something, for example, they have a committee, and we have one too, they have political parties, and we also have several, they have newspapers, and we even have dozens or hundreds of large and small newspapers. The difference is that our committee is unitary, and even newspapers belong to a unitary system, newspaper news belongs to a unitary system, and public opinion is naturally no exception."
"Collection of Javelins," page 31.

Note: Wu Han used this text to viciously attack the absolute leadership of the Party and attack the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, the phrase "the government is unitary" was too blatant, and in order for the black goods to be released, he had to "reluctantly part with" it.

"The annihilation of the Zhu Ming regime was annihilated by the opposition between this regime and the people. Killing the chicken to get the eggs."
"Exactly three hundred years ago, when the situation in Beiping was most tense, the government asked nobles, ministers, wealthy merchants, and tycoons to donate money to save the country,... However, as a result, the most famous rich man gave the least,... Although the people were willing to give all they had to repay the country, unfortunately, they had already been squeezed dry."
"The opposition between the government and the people in the early seventeenth century, the government army surrounded and chased 'bandits,' and the two forces mutually cancelled each other out, giving the emerging Jianzhou tribe outside the Guan an opportunity to take advantage of, and they took advantage of the opportunity to establish the Great Qing Empire."
"On the Late Ming 'Bandits'," February 12, 1945, Chongqing "Xinhua Daily."
"Mirror of History," pages 103, 105, 109.

"The annihilation of the Zhu Ming regime was annihilated by the opposition between this regime and the people, and endless exploitation."
"Exactly three hundred years ago, when the situation in Beijing was most tense, the emperor asked nobles, big ministers, wealthy merchants, and tycoons to donate money to save the country,... However, as a result, the most famous rich man gave the least,... The people, however, had already been squeezed dry."
"The opposition between the government and the people in the early seventeenth century, the government army surrounded and chased 'bandits,' giving the emerging Jianzhou tribe outside the Guan an opportunity to take advantage of, and they took advantage of the opportunity to establish the Great Qing Empire."
"Collection of Javelins," pages 37, 38, 42.

Note: In 1934, Wu Han wrote an article, "The Social Background of the Late Ming Bandits," offering advice to Chiang Kai-shek on how to eliminate the Red Army. In 1945, he changed the appearance of this article and published it in the Chongqing "Xinhua Daily," but still left some traces. For example, advising Chiang Kai-shek not to "kill the chicken to get the eggs," that is, to ask him to "raise chickens to get eggs," and so on.

"We... also respect the wishes of the true American people to respect democracy and freedom, and the commendable and touching efforts of the late President Roosevelt, which the Chinese people will never forget..."
"We not only happily send the battle-tested democratic fighters, the brave American soldiers, back home..."
"In order to maintain the traditional friendship of hundreds of years, in order to maintain the gratitude for the full supply of assistance needed by the Chinese people for eight years..."
"A Public Statement to General Hurley," Kunming "Democracy Weekly" Volume 2, Issue 17, November 22, 1945.

Note: Look at his original slavish face!

"At least we must first do administrative punishments and cancel the ban. If the first two problems are solved, some students will naturally return to class. If the remaining two points are achieved, the national discipline will be maintained, and the people's trust in the government will increase. If the government truly practices democracy,... guaranteeing absolute respect for all freedoms of the people, gaining full trust and respect from the people,"
"We... also respect the wishes of the true American people to respect democracy and freedom."
"We not only happily send the battle-tested American soldiers back home..."
"In order to maintain the traditional friendship between the Chinese and American people for hundreds of years, in order to maintain the gratitude for the assistance needed by the Chinese people from the American people for eight years..."
"Collection of Javelins," page 62.

"At least we must first do administrative punishments and cancel the ban. If the first two problems are solved, the students will naturally return to class. If the government truly practices democracy, puts the people first, can immediately stop the civil war, immediately convene a political consultation conference, and immediately organize a coalition government, guaranteeing absolute respect for all freedoms of the people, that would not only solve the so-called 'unfortunate incident' this time, but the people would also dare to guarantee with full confidence that there would be no similar incidents in the future."
"On the December 1st Massacre and Discipline," Kunming "Democracy Weekly" Volume 2, Issue 20, December 25, 1945.

...that would not only solve the so-called 'unfortunate incident' this time, but also gain trust and respect from the people."
"Collection of Javelins," page 76.

Note: This is completely the face of a henchman of Chiang Kai-shek! Wu Han was eager to throw out black guns, and he changed them in a hurry, and he still left the outline of this face.

"Secondly, we must not be afraid of trouble or wasting words, and once again appeal to American friends that the peace of China is determined by the American people. As long as the American people can recognize the reasons for the unfortunate situation in China today, immediately use all their strength to stop the American government from providing weapons, equipment, transportation facilities, and loans to any country engaged in civil war, China can immediately embark on the road of peace, democracy, and prosperity. This is not only helping the Chinese people, not only helping Special Envoy Marshall, but also helping the American people, because only a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous China can become the market that the United States needs.
Fifteen days have already passed for four days. These fifteen days cannot only be the fifteen days of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but should be the fifteen days of the people of the whole country. We should take action to tell the negotiating parties that these fifteen days are the final limit that the people can tolerate. After this limit, the people will rise up to stop this shameful civil war. We no longer trust any promises or words, we want a permanent cessation of the civil war."
"The Fifteen Days That Will Determine Future History," Shanghai "Democracy Weekly," Issue 35, June 15, 1946.

"Secondly, we must not be afraid of trouble or wasting words, and once again appeal to the American people that the peace of China is related to the American people. As long as the American people can recognize that the reasons for the unfortunate situation in China today are due to the American government directly manipulating the Chinese civil war, as long as the American people understand this point, immediately use all their strength to stop the American government from providing weapons, equipment, transportation facilities, and loans to any country engaged in civil war, China can embark on the road of peace, democracy, and prosperity. Doing so will not only help the Chinese people, not only help Special Envoy Marshall, but also help the American people, because only a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous China can guarantee world peace.
Fifteen days have already passed for four days. These fifteen days cannot only be the fifteen days of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but should be the fifteen days of the people of the whole country. We should take action to tell the parties still insisting on civil war that these fifteen days are the final limit that the people can tolerate. After this limit, the people will rise up to stop this shameful civil war. We no longer trust any promises or words, we want a permanent cessation of the civil war."
"Collection of Javelins," pages 123-124.

Note: The so-called anti-American "peace fighter" is actually a broker for selling out the country; the so-called anti-Chiang is actually anti-Communist.

"According to past historical facts, everyone knows that the Communist Party cannot be eliminated. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have had twenty years of combat experience,... Today's Communist Party is more powerful than it was at that time in every respect; the Kuomintang, I am afraid, is not more powerful than it was at that time, and apart from the unilateral support of the United States, there is nothing to be sure of winning. Isn't such a comparison very clear? The people who have no party affiliation and no private interests can see clearly that the Kuomintang will never be able to eliminate the Communist Party, and vice versa, the Communist Party will not be able to eliminate the Kuomintang.
If the two parties are in a stalemate, the people will suffer, and it will not be beneficial to incur the wrath of the people. Moreover, taking a step back and thinking for the Kuomintang,... the only consequence of fighting a civil war is further inflation, more political helplessness, more suffering for the people, fleeing to Yang and returning to Mo, driving fish into the deep, creating a stronger Communist Party and a more declining Kuomintang, which is also not worthwhile."
"On the Anti-Civil War Movement," Shanghai "Weekly," Issue 42, June 22, 1946.

"According to past historical facts, everyone knows that the Communist Party cannot be eliminated. The Kuomintang and the Communist Party have had twenty years of combat experience, and they should understand that in the past, in that small area of Jiangxi, the Communist Party had such a limited amount of military power, and five encirclements and suppressions, ten years of hard fighting, still could not solve it. Today's Communist Party is more powerful than it was at that time in every respect; the Kuomintang, I am afraid, is not more powerful than it was at that time, and apart from the unilateral support of the United States, there is nothing to be sure of winning. Isn't such a comparison very clear?
If brothers fight each other, the people will suffer, and it will not be beneficial to incur the resentment of the people. Moreover, taking a step back and thinking for the Kuomintang, having said all the good things and done all the bad things, it has reached the point where the heavens are angry and people are resentful, and 'I will perish with you.' It is still necessary to fight a civil war, the only consequence of fighting a civil war is further inflation, more political helplessness, more suffering for the people, and the Kuomintang's further decline. It is also not worthwhile."
"Collection of Javelins," pages 130-131.

Note: This is ironclad evidence of Wu Han's anti-communist and counter-revolutionary stance.

"Speaking of Britain and the United States, it's terrible, the political struggles in democratic countries are fought with pens and mouths, whoever's reasoning is right, whoever's words can be兑现 [duìxiàn - fulfilled], whoever gets the people's support, whoever wins. There is no such thing at all [referring to assassination]."
"On Assassination Politics," Shanghai "Democracy Weekly" Issue 43, August 1946.

"Speaking of Britain and the United States, it's terrible, the political struggles in these capitalist countries are fought with pens and mouths, whoever's reasoning is right, whoever's words are persuasive, whoever can deceive the people, whoever wins, there is no such thing at all. Moreover, on the contrary, if anyone dares to use the base means of assassination to achieve political goals, this person will definitely be abandoned by the people, and there is no second way except destruction."
"Collection of Javelins," page 211.

Note: Clearly a peddler of American-style democracy, now applying a little rouge and trying to disguise himself as an exposer of the capitalist system. But it is difficult to change his nature, and he is still beautifying American imperialism.

"There is no neutrality between right and wrong."
"There can never be neutrality between democracy and anti-democracy."
"The people completely stand on the side of democracy, resolutely demand democracy, realize democracy, no neutrality, absolutely no neutrality."
"There is no neutrality between democracy and anti-democracy."
"'Treat me kindly and I will be grateful; abuse me and I will be your enemy.' In the people's dictionary, there is no such word as neutrality."
"On Neutrality," "China Forum" Volume 1, Issue 12, August 1946.

"There is no neutrality between right and wrong, there is no middle ground!"
"There can never be neutrality between democracy and anti-democracy. There is no middle ground."
"The people completely stand on the side of democracy, resolutely demand democracy, realize democracy, no neutrality, absolutely no neutrality, absolutely not standing in the middle."
"There is no neutrality between democracy and anti-democracy, there is absolutely no middle ground."
"'Treat me kindly and I will be grateful; abuse me and I will be your enemy.' In the people's dictionary, there is no such word as neutrality, nor is there a middle ground."
"Collection of Javelins," page 218.

Note: "There is no neutrality between right and wrong"! What is Wu Han's "right" and what is his "wrong"? "There can never be neutrality between democracy and anti-democracy"! What class of democracy is Wu Han's democracy? Wu Han's democracy is the democracy of a small group of bourgeois right-wingers, Wu Han's "right" is the "middle road," the third road, and Wu Han's "wrong" is the revolutionary line of the Communist Party of China. A promoter of the "middle road" puts on the laurels of resolutely opposing the "middle road" after liberation, and his courage to "falsify and commit fraud" is truly great!

"Due to the expansion of the civil war, the suffering of the people has been aggravated and deepened,... squeezing the last drop of blood and sweat from the peasants. There are also millions of strong men fighting and killing each other on the front lines, dying inexplicably."
"Democracy in China, like other things, has a double-packaged case. There is true democracy and false democracy. Everyone thinks they are true and accuses the other side of being fake goods, counterfeit goods."
"What to Do?" Shanghai "Weekly" Issues 49, 50, August 24, 1946.

"Due to the expansion of the civil war, the suffering of the people has been aggravated and deepened, factories have closed down in the cities, shops have closed, workers and shop assistants have lost their jobs, students have not been able to pay tuition fees and have dropped out of school, and in the countryside, there has been a renewed requisition of grain and other materials; squeezing the last drop of blood and sweat from the peasants."
"Democracy in China, like other things, has a double-packaged case. There is true democracy and false democracy. The false also insist that they are true."
"Collection of Javelins," pages 224, 225.

Note: This is the so-called "middle road," the "third road"!

"Why not first have some temporary local coalition governments in these disputed areas?
The method is, first, both sides withdraw their troops and turn the disputed areas into demilitarized zones. Second, the three foreign ministers of the Moscow meeting, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, or the United Nations Security Council, should take steps to democratically produce local coalition governments in these areas.
Some people may say that this is inviting international interference and losing national dignity.
Then, we want to ask, is it dignified for the United States alone to handle the China issue?
Moreover, the Security Council is an organization above the state, and in terms of law and reason, even in terms of face, there will be no problem.
Doing so can stop the civil war, or at least prevent it from expanding."
"What to Do?"

"Why can't we first have some temporary local coalition governments in these disputed areas?
The method is, first, both sides withdraw their troops and turn the disputed areas into demilitarized zones. Second, the local people use universal suffrage to produce local coalition governments.
Doing so can stop the civil war, or at least prevent it from expanding."
"Collection of Javelins," page 230.

Note: A servant of the United Nations! A lackey of the United States!

"Then, here, I want to advise the Kuomintang authorities in the capacity of the people, while you are still in power today, do more good deeds, do them immediately, do them and then talk about them; it is better to do them without talking about them, hungry people are easy to feed, thirsty people are easy to drink, and the people's satisfaction is not a hassle. At least, don't do any more bad things, cancel the requisition of grain and other materials,... severely punish corrupt officials, I dare to guarantee, and the people will also guarantee, as long as you can do these things, completely and completely, you don't have to worry about the people not standing on your side."
"What to Do?"

"Then, here, I want to advise the Kuomintang authorities in the capacity of the people, while you are still in power today, do more good deeds, do them immediately, do them and then talk about them; it is better to do them without talking about them, hungry people are easy to feed, thirsty people are easy to drink, and the people are easy to satisfy. At least, don't do any more bad things. Cancel the requisition of grain and other materials! Cancel the special agent agencies! Stop fighting the wind and killing the wind! Revoke the orders to close newspapers and periodicals! Abolish China Textile and China Silk! Severely punish corrupt officials! I dare to guarantee, and the people will also guarantee, as long as you can do these things, completely and completely, you will still have a future."
"Collection of Javelins," page 231.

Note: This is also a "petition for public safety" to the Kuomintang!

"Fourth, the solution object of the Political Consultative Conference, because of the limitations of its organizational composition, focuses on the elimination of party conflicts, in other words, it is the solution of a large number of problems between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, not the solution of the problems of the people themselves. It is wrong and incorrect to simply see today's serious situation in China as just a conflict between the two parties. On the contrary, the main thing that needs to be solved first today is the problem that the people cannot tolerate the oppression and exploitation of the anti-democratic regime,... in other words, the people have no interest in party struggles, and they are sworn to oppose the use of military force to solve party struggles. On the contrary, the people want to establish a democratic government that serves the people themselves to relieve suffering and improve their lives."
"The power of the people is latent. An organization that represents the sum of the power of the people, that goes beyond party interests, and that represents the interests of the broad middle class is necessary today and should be made a reality immediately."
"The mission of the emergence of this force is no longer a middle-style mediator, but a guide to China's future that completely stands on the side of the people. For party disputes,... there is no concession and no perfunctory, as is the case with everything that democratic people love and fight against everything relative.
...
Assuming that China has 450 million people, the middle class accounts for more than 90 percent, and 90 percent of the people can participate in this new foundation, strengthen this new foundation, and any problem can be solved and any difficulty can be conquered."
"On the New Foundation," Beiping "Democracy Weekly" Issue 15, November 1946.

"Fourth, the solution object of the Political Consultative Conference, because of the limitations of its organizational composition, focuses on the elimination of party conflicts. It is wrong and incorrect to simply see today's serious situation in China as a conflict between the two parties. On the contrary, the main thing that needs to be solved first today is the problem that the people cannot tolerate the oppression and exploitation of the anti-democratic regime, it is the choice between democracy and the anti-democratic regime, it is the problem that the people themselves want to exercise sovereignty; in other words, it is the problem of the people wanting to establish a democratic government that serves the people themselves to relieve suffering and improve their lives."
"The power of the people is infinite. An organization that represents the sum of the power of the people, that goes beyond party interests, and that represents the interests of the broad people is necessary today and should be made a reality immediately."
"The mission of the emergence of this force is no longer a middle-style mediator, but a guide to China's future that completely stands on the side of the people. For party disputes, there is only the standard of right and wrong, the standard of democracy and anti-democracy, and the standard of what the people love or hate, there is no concession and no perfunctory.
Here, the power itself is the balance scale, deciding everything and executing everything, instead of being a weight itself, as a relatively balanced force, as in the past.
Assuming that China has 450 million people, the non-party people account for more than 90 percent, and 90 percent of the people can participate in this new foundation and strengthen this new foundation, and any problem can be solved and any difficulty can be conquered."
"Collection of Javelins," pages 234, 235, 236.

Note: Wu Han, an anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary person, proclaims himself as the representative of the people, while excluding the true representative of the Chinese people—the Communist Party of China—from the people. How rampant this is!

"The civil war has further expanded, and even the mantra of peace and unity has been put into the historical archives. The parties that are killing and destroying each other are all Chinese people, with the same skin color, the same blood, the same clothes, and the same heads. The accumulated bones form mountains, the blood flows into rivers, people are arrested and released, and those who kill are the Chinese people, and those who are killed are still the Chinese people. In such a situation, our mood is heavy and indignant when we commemorate the May Fourth Movement."
"On Commemorating the May Fourth Movement," "Tsinghua Weekly" May 4, 1947.

"The civil war has further expanded, and even the mantra of peace and unity has been put into the historical archives.
In such a situation, our mood is heavy and indignant when we commemorate the May Fourth Movement."
"Collection of Javelins," page 265.

Note: Just as the Chinese People's Liberation War was developing victoriously, Wu Han did not distinguish the nature of the war, did not distinguish between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, and said that everyone had "the same heads," and generally opposed the war. This is blatantly undermining the people's revolutionary war and serving the Kuomintang.

### 吴晗一九五九年编的《投枪集》是怎样“作伪舞弊”的？

    吴晗一九五九年编的《投枪集》是怎样“作伪舞弊”的？
    吴晗在《投枪集》的前言中说，“收在这个集子里的文章，除个别地方文字上稍加改动以外，如满清一律改作清朝之类——基本上没有什么修改。”“作伪舞弊，何苦呢，又何必呢！”“要动笔改，可难了，……要改全篇中心论点，可不成。”总之是没有改，《投枪集》是按原来的面目出版的。
    吴晗这些话，又对又不对。说它对，是因为有些东西，吴晗确实没有改，不肯改，死抱住不放，一直坚持到今天。这就是他的反共、反人民、反革命的反动的资产阶级立场。说它不对，是因为吴晗在撒谎。他为了更好地贩卖他那批资产阶级的黑货，进行反党反社会主义的罪恶勾当，在编集《投枪集》时，“作伪舞弊”，有许多重大的修改。哪些不改，哪些改，怎样改，这里面大有文章。我们选择其中一部分，作了一个校勘表，有些地方略加按语，以饗读者。

      “贪污的根绝，治本的办法应该是把‘人’从家族的桎梏下解放出来。个人生活独立，每一个人都为工作而生存，不工作者不得食，人与人之间无倚赖心，从家族本位的社会组织改变为个人本位的社会组织，从依赖家长生活消费性的社会组织，改变为人人工作自食其力的生产性的社会组织，……”
                 《投枪集》第六页。
    按：原来的目的很清楚：要建立一个资本主义社会。这一改，资本主义的货色犹存，又点缀一些社会主义的词句，不伦不类。殊不知，这一来，正暴露他今天打起拥护社会主义的旗号，继续贩卖资本主义的货色。
    “三百年前，当明思宗殉国以后。李自成西走，清人借吴三桂的向导，占领北平分兵南下的时候，南京小朝廷领袖弘光帝，正在粉饰升平，……夜以继日。他的父亲死于非命，元配离散不知下落，国君殉国，国土一部分沦于流寇，一部分被异族兵威所蹂躏，……”
      “三百年前，当南京小朝廷覆亡的前夕，清兵迫近江北，流寇纵横晋陕，民穷财尽，内忧外患交迫的时候。……”
      “三百年前，当外族铁蹄纵横河朔，‘流寇’主力恣张晋豫，国破民散，人不聊生的时候，拥兵数十万虎踞长江上游的左良玉，却按兵不动，坐观兴亡。他看透了政局的混乱，只要自己能保全实力，舍出一点贿赂当局，自然会加官晋爵，封妻荫子。在这个看法之下，他不肯用全力来消灭‘流寇’，却用全力来扩充队伍。政府也仰仗他全力对付‘流寇’，不肯调出来对付外敌。”
    《三百年前的历史教训》，一九四四年，昆明《正义报》《新论衡》周刊第九期。
    《历史的镜子》第九十九、一○一页。
    “三百年前，当明思宗自杀以后，李自成西走，清人借汉奸吴三桂的向导，占领北京分兵南下的时候，南京小朝廷领袖弘光帝，正在粉饰升平，兴建宫室，大备百官，征歌选舞，夜以继日。”
      “三百年前，当南京小朝廷覆亡的前夕，清兵迫近江北，民穷财尽，内忧外患交迫的时候，……”
      “三百年前，当外族铁蹄蹂躏河朔，国破民散，人不聊生的时候，拥兵数十万虎踞长江上游的左良玉，却按兵不动，坐观兴亡。他看透了政局的混乱，只要自己能保全实力，舍出一点贿赂当局，自然会加官晋爵，封妻荫子。政府也仰仗他对付农民起义军，不肯调出来对付外敌。”
      《投枪集》第二十四、二十五页。
    按：从删去的部分可以清楚地看到，吴晗当年写这篇《三百年前的历史教训》，有明显的政治目的：用“流寇”影射坚持抗日的八路军、新四军，替蒋介石出谋划策，用全力消灭八路军、新四军。吴晗反共、反革命的面目，跃然纸上。
    “民主国家有一个特点，便是多党政治。在野的政党有堂堂正正批评政府的权利，倒过来，在野党执政了，执政党在野，同样保有这权利。彼此互相批评，互相责难，一方面有权提出以事实为根据的质问，被质问的也有义务提供解释的事实，是非曲直，取决于人民的舆论，舆论所表见的工具，最主要的是报纸。”
    “几十年来我们沐猴而冠，事事学人家，学得都有点样子，例如人家有政府，我们也有，人家有委员会，我们也有，……所不同的是我们的政府是一元的，委员会是一元的，……”
    《报纸与舆论》，一九四五年。
    《历史的镜子》第三十四、三十五页。
    “几十年来我们沐猴而冠，事事学人家，学得都有点样子，例如人家有委员会，我们也有，人家有政党，我们也有好几个，人家有报纸，我们居然也有几十百种大大小小的报纸。所不同的是我们的委员会是一元的，甚至报纸也属于一元的，报纸的消息属于一元，舆论自然也无例外。”
              《投枪集》第三十一页。
    按：吴晗是用这篇文字恶毒地攻击党的绝对领导，攻击无产阶级专政。但是，“政府是一元的”这句话，实在太露骨了，为了黑货能够出笼，只好“忍痛割爱”。
      “朱明政权的被消灭，被消灭于这政权和人民的对立。杀鸡求卵。”
      “在整三百年前，北平的形势最紧张的时候，政府请勋贵大臣富贾巨商献金救国，……可是，结果，最著名的一个富豪出得最少，……人民虽然肯尽其所有报效国家，可惜的是他们早已被榨干了。”
      “十七世纪前期的政府和人民的对立，政府军包围，追逐‘流寇’，两个力量互相抵销，给关外的新兴的建州部族以可乘之机，乘虚窜入，建立了大清帝国。”
    《论晚明“流寇”》，一九四五年二月十二日，重庆《新华日报》。
    《历史的镜子》第一○三、一○五、一○九页。
    “朱明政权的被消灭，被消灭于这政权和人民的对立，剥削无度”。
    “在整三百年前，北京的形势最紧张的时候，皇帝请勋贵大巨富贾巨商献金救国，……可是结果，最著名的一个富豪出得最少，……人民呢，早已被榨干了。”
    “十七世纪前期的政府和人民的对立，政府军包围、追逐‘流寇’，给关外的新兴的建州部族以可乘之机，乘虚窜入，建立了大清帝国。”
    《投枪集》，第三十七、三十八、四十二页。
    按：一九三四年，吴晗写了《晚明流寇之社会背景》一文，向蒋介石献策消灭红军。一九四五年，他把这篇文章改头换面，在重庆《新华日报》发表，但仍留下一些痕迹。如劝蒋介石不要“杀鸡求卵”，即要他“养鸡取卵”等等。
    “我们……也尊重真正美国人民大众的尊重民主自由的愿望，和故罗斯福总统的永不能使中国人民忘怀的可敬可感的努力，……”
    “我们不但欢送曾经百战的民主斗士，英勇的美军回国，……”
    “为了保持百年来传统的友谊，为了保持八年来对于中国人民所需要的援助的充分供应的感激，……”
    《正告赫尔利将军》，昆明《民主周
      刊》第二卷第十七期，一九四五年十
      一月二十二日。
    按：请看他本来的洋奴面目！
      “至少要先做到行政的处分和取消禁令，前二项问题解决了一部分学生自然复课，做到了其余两点，国家纲纪保持，人民对政府的信任增加，如果政府真是实行民主，……保证人民一切自由的绝对尊重，获得人民充分信任和尊敬，
    “我们……也尊重真正美国人民大众尊重民主自由的愿望。”
    “我们不但欢送曾经百战的美军回国，……”
    “为了保持百年来中美人民之间传统的友谊，为了保持八年来美国人民对于中国人民所需要的援助的感激，……”
                《投枪集》第六十二页。
      “至少要先做到行政的处分和取消禁令，前二项问题解决了，学生自然复课。如果政府真是实行民主，以人民为重，能够立刻停止内战，立刻召开政治协商会议，立刻组织联合政府，保证对人民一切自由的绝对尊重，那岂止解决那岂止解决此次的所谓‘不幸事件’，人民还敢以充分的信心保证此后不再有任何的类似事件发生。”
    《论一二一惨案与纪纲》，昆明《民主周刊》第二卷第二十期，一九四五年十二月二十五日。此次的所谓‘不幸事件’而已，还可以获得人民信任和尊敬。”
              《投枪集》第七十六页。
    按：这完全是一副蒋介石帮凶的嘴脸！吴晗急于投出黑枪，改得匆匆忙忙，还留下了这副嘴脸的轮廓。
      “其次我们要不惮烦，不嫌费辞，再度向美国友人呼吁，中国的和平决定于美国人民。只要美国人民能够认识今天中国不幸局面之所以造成，立刻以全力制止美国政府，不许再供给武器配备，运输方便，以及借款等等于任何从事内战的国家，中国立刻可以走上和平民主繁荣的道路，这不止是帮助了中国人民，不止是帮助了马歇尔特使，也帮助了美国人民，因为只有和平民主繁荣的中国，才能够成为美国所需要的市场。
    十五天已经溜走了四天了，这十五天不能只是国共两党的十五天，而应该是全国人民的十五天。我们应该有行动，告诉谈判中的双方，这十五天是人民所能容忍的最后限度。过了这限度，人民要自己起来制止这可耻的内战，我们不再信任任何诺言和文字，我们要的是永久停止内战。”
    《决定今后历史的十五天》，上海《民主周刊》，第三十五期，一九四六年六月十五日。
    “其次我们要不惮烦，不嫌费辞，再度向美国人民呼吁，中国的和平是和美国人民有关系的。只要美国人民能够认识今天中国不幸局面之所以造成，是由于美国政府直接操纵中国内战，只要美国人民了解这一点，立刻以全力制止美国政府，不许再供给武器配备，运输方便，以及借款等等于任何从事内战的国家，中国是可以走上和平民主繁荣的道路的。这样做，不止是帮助了中国人民，不止是帮助了马歇尔特使，也帮助了美国人民，因为只有和平民主繁荣的中国，才能够保证世界的和平。
    十五天已经溜走了四天了，这十五天不能只是国共两党的十五天，而应该是全国人民的十五天。我们应该有行动，告诉仍在坚持内战的政党，这十五天是人民所能容忍的最后限度。过了这限度，人民要自己起来制止这可耻的内战，我们不再信任任何诺言和文字，我们要的是永久停止内战。”
    《投枪集》第一二三——一二四页。
    按：原来所谓反美的“和平斗士”，实际上是出卖祖国的掮客；所谓反蒋，实际上是反共。
    “根据过去的史实，谁都知道共产党是消灭不了的。国民党和共产党有了二十年的作战经验，……今天的共产党比之那时候无论从那方面说都更强大了；国民党呢，怕不比那时候更强大，除了美国的片面支持以外，并没有什么可操的胜算。这样一个对比，不是很明白的吗？没有党见和私利的人民是看得清楚的，国民党决消灭不了共产党，反之，共产党也消灭不了国民党。
    两党相持，人民受罪，结怒于人民是不会有什么好处的，而且，退一步替国民党想，……打内战的唯一后果是通货再膨胀，政治更无办法，人民更痛苦，逃杨归墨，为渊驱鱼，造成共产党的更强大，国民党的更没落，也是划算不来的。”
    《论反内战运动》，上海《周报》第四十二期，一九四六年六月二十二日。
    “根据过去的史实，谁都知道共产党是消灭不了的。国民党和共产党有了二十年的作战经验，应该明白过去在江西那一小块地区，共产党那末有限的一点兵力，围剿五次，苦战十年还解决不了。今天的共产党比之那时候无论从那方面说都更强大了；国民党呢，怕不比那时候更强大，除了美国的片面支持以外，并没有什么可操的胜算。这样一个对比，不是很明白的吗？
    同室操戈，人民受罪，结怨于人民是不会有什么好处的。而且，退一步替国民党想，好话说尽，坏事做绝，已经到了天怒人怨，‘予与汝偕亡’的地步了。还要打内战，打内战的唯一后果是通货再膨胀，政治更无办法，人民更痛苦，国民党的更没落。也是划算不来的。”
    《投枪集》第一三○——一三一页。按：这是吴晗反共、反革命的铁证。
    “说英国，美国，糟了，民主国家的政争用笔争，用口争，谁的道理对，谁的话能兑现，谁得人民拥护，谁就得胜。根本没有这一套（按：指暗杀）。……”
    《论暗杀政治》，上海《民主周刊》第四十三期，一九四六年八月。
      “说英国，美国，糟了，这些资本主义国家的政争用笔争，用口争，谁的道理对，谁的话说得动听，谁能骗得了人民，谁就得胜，根本没有这一套。而且，相反，假如谁敢于用暗杀的下流手段来达到政治上目的的话，这人一定被人民所共弃，除了毁灭以外，没有第二条路。”
              《投枪集》第二一一页。
    按：明明是美国式民主的贩卖者，现在涂上一点脂粉，企图把自己化装成资本主义制度的揭露者。但是本性难移，他还在美化美帝国主义。
    “是与非之间无中立。”
    “民主和反民主之间也绝不可能有中立。”
    “人民完全站在民主的一边，坚决的要求民主，实现民主，不中立，绝对不中立。”
    “民主和反民主之间无中立。”
    “‘抚我则后，虐我则仇’，在人民的辞典中，没有中立这一个名词。”
    《论中立》，《中华论坛》第一卷第十二期，一九四六年八月。
    “是与非之间无中立，中间路线是没有的！”
    “民主和反民主之间是绝对不可能有中立的。中间路线是没有的。”
    “人民完全站在民主的一边，坚决的要求民主，实现民主，不中立，绝对不中立，绝对不站在中间。”
    “民主和反民主之间无中立，绝对没有中间路线。”
    “‘抚我则后，虐我则仇’，在人民的辞典中，没有中立，也没有中间路线这一个名词。”
                  《投枪集》第二一八页
    按：“是与非之间无中立”！吴晗的“是”是什么，“非”又是什么呢？“民主和反民主之间也绝不可能有中立”！吴晗的民主是什么阶级的民主呢？吴晗的民主是一小撮资产阶级右翼的民主，吴晗的“是”，就是“中间路线”，第三条道路，吴晗的“非”，就是中国共产党的革命路线。一个“中间路线”的鼓吹者，在解放后又给自己戴上坚决反对“中间路线”的桂冠，“作伪舞弊”的胆子可谓大矣！
      “由于内战的扩大，使人民的苦难加重加深，……绞尽农民最后一滴血汗。还有数以百万计的壮丁在前线相斫相杀，莫名其妙地死去。”
    “民主在中国也象旁的东西一样，闹双包案了，有真民主，有假民主。人人自以为真，指斥对方的是假货，冒牌货。”
    《怎么办？》，上海《周报》第四十九、五十期，一九四六年八月二十四日。
    “由于内战的扩大，使人民的苦难加重加深，都市中工厂倒闭，商店关门，工人店员失业，学生交不出学费失学，农村中又重新征购征实了；绞尽农民最后一滴血汗。”
    “民主在中国也象旁的东西一样，闹双包案了，有真民主，有假民主。假的也偏偏说自己是真的。”
    《投枪集》第二二四、二二五页。按：这就是所谓“中间道路”，“第三条路线”！
    “为什么不先在这些有争执的地区，先来一些临时的地方联合政府呢？
    办法，第一双方都把军队撤开，把有争执地区转变成非军事区。第二由莫斯科三外长会议参加者英美苏三国或由联合国安全理事会采取步骤，在这些地区以民主方式产生地方联合政府。
    或者有人会说这样来是招致国际干涉，有失国家体面。
    那末，我们要问由美国一国来处理中国问题，是不是够体面？
    而且安理会是国家之上的一个组织，在法理上，就是在面子上，都不会有问题的。
    这样办，内战可以停止，至少可以不致扩大。”
                          《怎么办？》。
    “为什么不可以先在这些有争执的地区，先搞一些临时的地方联合政府呢？
    办法，第一双方都把军队撤开，把有争执地区转变成非军事区。第二由当地人民用普选方法产生地方联合政府。
    这样办，内战可以停止，至少可以不致扩大。”
              《投枪集》第二三○页。
    按：联合国的仆从！美国的奴才！
    “那末，于此，我要以人民的资格，奉劝国民党当局，趁今天还在位的时候，多做一点好事，即刻做，做了再说；做了而不说更好，饥者易为食，渴者易为饮，人民的满足是不费事的。至少，不要再做坏事，取消征购征实吧，……严办贪官污吏吧，我敢保证，人民也会保证，你们只要能做到这些，完完全全的做到，是不愁人民不站在你们这一边的。”
                        《怎么办？》。
    “那末，于此，我要以人民的资格，奉劝国民党当局，趁今天还在位的时候，多做一点好事，即刻做，做了再说；做了而不说更好，饥者易为食，渴者易为饮，人民是容易满足的。至少，不要再做坏事。取消征购征实吧！取消特务机构吧！停止打风和杀风吧！收回封闭报纸期刊的命令吧！撤销中纺、中蚕吧！严办贪官污吏吧！我敢保证，人民也会保证，你们只要能做到这些，完完全全的做到，你们还会有前途的。”	    《投枪集》第二三一页。
    按：这也是向国民党上的一篇“治安疏”！
    “第四，政协的解决对象因为组织成分的限制，着重在党派冲突的清除，质言之，是国民党和共产党一大串问题的解决，而不是人民本身问题的解决。把今天中国的严重局面单纯地看作只是两党之争是错误的，不正确的，反之，今天的主要的首先要解决的是人民不能忍受反民主政权压迫剥削的问题，……质言之，人民对于党争无兴趣，对以兵力解决党争则誓死反对，相反的，人民要建立一个为人民自己服务的民主政府，来解除痛苦，提高生活。”
    “人民的力量是潜在的，一个代表人民力量总和的组织，超出党派利益，代表广大的中间群人民利益的组织在今天是必需的，应该使其立刻现实存在的。”
    “这一力量的出现，它的使命不再是中间式的调人，而是完全站在人民立场的中国前途的引导者。对于党派的争执，……没有迁就没有敷衍，如是的民主的人民所喜爱的一切和相对的一切斗争。
    ……
    中国的人口假定有四万万五千万，中间阶层占百分之九十以上，百分之九十的人民能够参加这新基础，坚强这新基础，任何问题是可以解决的，任何困难是可以征服的。”
    《论新基础》，北平《民主周刊》第十
      五期，一九四六年十一月。
    “第四，政协的解决对象因为组织成份的限制，着重在党派冲突的清除，把今天中国的严重局面单纯地看作两党之争是错误的，不正确的。反之，今天的主要的首先要解决的是人民不能忍受反民主政权压迫剥削的问题，是民主和反民主政权的选择问题，是人民自己要来行使主权的问题；质言之，人民要建立一个为人民自己服务的民主政府，来解除痛苦，提高生活的问题。”
    “人民的力量是无穷的，一个代表人民力量总和的组织，超出党派利益，代表广大的人民利益的组织在今天是必需的，是应该使其立刻实现的。”
    “这一力量的出现，它的使命不再是中间式的调人了，而是完全站在人民立场的中国前途的引导者。对于党派的争执，只有是非的标准，民主和反民主的标准，人民所喜爱或憎恶的标准，没有迁就也不许可有敷衍。
    于此，这力量的本身就是天平秤，决定一切，执行一切，而不是象过去那样，自身作为法码，作为一个相对的平衡的力量。
    中国的人口假定有四万万五千万，无党派的人民占百分之九十以上，百分之九十的人民能够参加这新基础，加强这新基础，任何问题是可以解决的，任何困难是可以征服的。”
    《投枪集》第二三四、二三五、二三六页。
    按：反共、反人民、反革命的吴晗，自封为人民的代表，而把中国人民的真正代表——中国共产党排除在人民之外，这是何等猖狂！
      “内战更扩大了，和平团结即使是口头禅也已被放进历史档案里去了。相杀相斫，轰炸，互相毁灭的双方都是中国人民，有一样的肤色，一样的血、一样的服装，一样的头脑。积骸成山、流血成河、抓进抓出，杀人的是中国人民，被杀的还是中国人民。在这样一个境况中来纪念五四，我们的心情是沉痛的、悲愤的。”
    《论纪念五四》，《清华周刊》一九四七年五月四日。
    “内战更扩大了，和平团结即使是口头禅也已被放进历史档案里去了。
    在这样一个境况中来纪念五四，我们的心情是沉痛的，悲愤的。”
              《投枪集》第二六五页。
    按：正当中国人民解放战争胜利发展的时候，吴晗不区别战争的性质，不区别共产党与国民党，说大家都有“一样的头脑”，笼统地反对战争。这是露骨地破坏人民革命战争，为国民党效劳。
