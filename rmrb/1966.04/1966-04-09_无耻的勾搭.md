    Shameless Collusion
    After Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's trips to Washington and Moscow, she has obviously gained new enlightenment and wants to take some action in opposing China. However, relying on repeating abusive clichés is no longer likely to attract attention. Therefore, the Indian reactionaries do not hesitate to further collude with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, staging a new ugly anti-China farce.
    The Indian authorities openly treat Chiang gang elements such as Shen Qi and his ilk as honored guests, getting along very well with them, and even allowing these national scum to recklessly express opinions against the motherland and in support of the Indian reactionaries in New Delhi. The Indian propaganda machine even tries its best to applaud the "closer" relationship between India and the Chiang gang. The Indian government has long played a shameful role as a pawn in the US imperialists' "Two Chinas" conspiracy. Now, in order to exchange for more US-Soviet aid, the Indian government is doing it even more unscrupulously and by any means.
    Indian government, do you think that by flirting with the Chiang Kai-shek gang spurned by the Chinese people, you can raise your status and add something new to your anti-China mess? To be honest, the Chiang Kai-shek gang cannot help your anti-China cause in any way. Your practice can only further expose your ugly face of selling yourselves to US imperialism and Soviet revisionism in front of the people of the world.

### 无耻的勾搭

    无耻的勾搭
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地跑了一趟华盛顿、莫斯科之后，显然又得到了新的启示，要在反华方面有所动作。但是，靠重复谩骂的滥调，已不大能引人注意了。于是印度反动派就不惜进一步同蒋匪帮勾搭，演出反华的新丑剧来。
    印度当局公然把蒋帮分子沈锜之流奉为上宾，同他们打得火热，而且让这些民族败类在新德里放肆地发表反对祖国和为印度反动派捧场的言论。印度的宣传机器甚至竭力为印度和蒋帮之间的关系“变得密切”喝采。印度政府在美帝国主义搞“两个中国”的阴谋中，扮演一个马前卒的可耻角色，由来已久。现在为了换取更多的美苏援助，印度政府干得更加肆无忌惮，更加不择手段了。
    印度政府，你们以为同中国人民所唾弃的蒋匪帮拉拉扯扯，就能够抬高你们的身价，替你们反华烂摊子增加什么新鲜货色吗？老实说，蒋匪帮是不可能给你们的反华事业帮什么忙的，你们这种做法，只能在全世界人民面前更加暴露你们卖身投靠美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的丑恶面目。
