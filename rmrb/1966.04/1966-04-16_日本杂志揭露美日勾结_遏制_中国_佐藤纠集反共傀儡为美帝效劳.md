    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Tokyo: The Japanese magazine *Sekai* (World), in its pre-released May issue, published a commentary pointing out that the Japanese Sato government is actively gathering anti-communist countries around China to oppose, encircle, and "contain" China for the United States. The commentary said that the Sato government had stated its intention to open up Japan-China relations. However, it is now clear that this was merely propaganda for domestic consumption. What people actually see is that the Sato government, which actively supports the United States in the Vietnam War, has not only failed to work towards improving relations with China but is also moving rapidly in the direction of gathering anti-communist countries around China. Specific manifestations include convening the "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" and participating in the "Asian Foreign Ministers' Conference" initiated by the South Korean Park Chung-hee clique.

    The commentary pointed out that Japan itself also "attempts to lay the foundation for obtaining political dominance through economic penetration into Southeast Asia. This idea is consistent with the American idea of 'strengthening the political and military strength of anti-communist countries around China and their connections with each other.'" The commentary pointed out that the "Asian Foreign Ministers' Conference" initiated by the Park Chung-hee puppet clique, which runs parallel to this conference, "aims to complete the encirclement of China and is a concrete response to the American policy of gathering Asian anti-communist countries to oppose China."

### 日本杂志揭露美日勾结“遏制”中国  佐藤纠集反共傀儡为美帝效劳

    日本杂志揭露美日勾结“遏制”中国
    佐藤纠集反共傀儡为美帝效劳
    据新华社东京电　日本提前出版的五月号《世界》杂志发表评论指出，日本佐藤政府正积极为美国纠集中国周围的反共国家，来反对中国，包围中国，“遏制”中国。评论说，佐藤政府曾表示要打开日中关系，但是，现在已经很清楚，这只不过是对国内的一种宣传而已。人们实际上看到的是，在越南战争中积极支持美国的佐藤政府不仅没有致力于同中国改善关系，而且向着纠集中国周围的反共国家的方向大步走下去。具体表现就是召开“东南亚开发部长会议”和参加由南朝鲜朴正熙集团倡议的“亚洲外长会议”。
    评论指出，日本本身也“企图通过向东南亚的经济渗透，为取得政治上的主导权打下基础。这种想法是与美国的‘加强中国周围反共国家的政治、军事力量和他们之间的联系’的想法是一致的”。评论指出，与这一会议并行的由朴正熙傀儡集团倡议的“亚洲外长会议”的“目的是完成对中国的包围圈，是对美国纠集亚洲反共国家反对中国政策的具体响应。”
