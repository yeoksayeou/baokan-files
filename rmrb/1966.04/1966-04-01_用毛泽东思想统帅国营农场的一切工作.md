    Use Mao Zedong Thought to Command All Work of State-Owned Farms
    The National State-Owned Farm Work Conference called on farm workers in various regions to, on the basis of existing achievements, further highlight politics, carry out the socialist education movement effectively, thoroughly break down foreign and old frameworks in operation and management, firmly take our own road, and strive to realize the various tasks of this year and the Third Five-Year Plan.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, the National State-Owned Farm Work Conference, held recently in Beijing, called on farm workers in various regions to, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further highlight politics, carry out the socialist education movement effectively, continue to break down foreign and old frameworks in operation and management, firmly take our own road, and strive to realize the various tasks of this year and the Third Five-Year Plan.
    Party and state leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Tan Zhenlin, and Bo Yibo received the participating representatives. Vice Premier Tan Zhenlin listened to the reports of some representatives and spoke on the principles and tasks of state-owned farm work. The concern of the Party and state leaders for state-owned farm work gave the representatives great encouragement.
    The meeting pointed out that in 1965, the staff and workers of the land reclamation system, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, paid attention to highlighting politics in all work, conscientiously implemented the Party's line and policies, and deeply carried out the three major revolutionary movements of class struggle, struggle for production, and scientific experimentation, achieving great results in political and ideological work and production and construction. Through this year's re-practice, the vast number of staff and workers further clearly realized that the decisive key to running state-owned farms well is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command all work of state-owned farms, proceed from China's actual conditions, and firmly take our own road.
    While affirming the above-mentioned achievements of state-owned farms in various regions, the meeting also pointed out the problems and shortcomings existing in land reclamation work, mainly: some farms did not highlight politics sufficiently in their work, their production levels were not high, farmland capital construction was not solid enough, and farming techniques were relatively crude, etc. The meeting pointed out that during the Third Five-Year Plan period, it is necessary to overcome shortcomings on the basis of carrying forward achievements, vigorously increase the yield per unit area of crops such as grain and cotton, strive to reach and exceed the targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" as soon as possible, and actively develop animal husbandry to provide the state with more animal products. At the same time, land reclamation departments in various regions must continue to implement the two labor systems and two education systems.
    Through careful summarization of last year's experience, combined with studying the exemplary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu and the reports of six activists in the land reclamation system who creatively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, the participating representatives unanimously believed that the fundamental key to realizing the above tasks is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, highlight politics in all work, and promote the continuous revolutionization of the ideology and work of staff and workers. The meeting pointed out that in the future, special attention should be paid to the following aspects:
    First, further carry out the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, regard Chairman Mao's works as the highest instruction for all work, and put the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of all work.
    Second, carry out the socialist education movement deeply and thoroughly. All farms must adhere to taking class struggle as the key link, grasp the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism and the two ideologies, and run socialist farms with socialist ideas and socialist methods.
    Third, effectively strengthen regular political work, in particular, political work must be implemented in production teams, everyone should do political work, and the political work of production teams must be effectively strengthened.
    Fourth, resolutely implement the Party Central Committee and the State Council's guidelines and policies on land reclamation work, continue to improve various rules and regulations, thoroughly break the shackles of various foreign and old frameworks in operation and management, further liberate productive forces, and conscientiously summarize experience, constantly discover, invent, create, and move forward.
    Participating in this meeting were more than 100 representatives from the land reclamation departments of 28 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country and the land reclamation areas directly under the Ministry of Land Reclamation.

    用毛泽东思想统帅国营农场的一切工作
    全国农垦工作会议号召各地农场职工在已有成绩基础上，进一步突出政治，搞好社会主义教育运动，彻底打破经营管理上的洋框框和旧框框，坚定地走自己的道路，为实现今年和第三个五年计划期间的各项任务而奋斗。
    据新华社讯　不久前，在北京召开的全国农垦工作会议，号召各地农场职工在已有成绩的基础上，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进一步突出政治，搞好社会主义教育运动，在经营管理上继续大破洋框框和旧框框，坚定地走自己的道路，为实现今年和第三个五年计划期间的各项任务而奋斗。
    刘少奇、周恩来、李富春、李先念、谭震林、薄一波等党和国家领导人接见了与会代表。谭震林副总理听取了部分代表的汇报，并就农垦工作的方针、任务问题讲了话。党和国家领导人对农垦工作的关怀，给代表们以极大的鼓舞。
    会议指出，一九六五年农垦系统职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，注意在各项工作中突出政治，认真贯彻执行了党的方针、政策，深入地开展了阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验三大革命运动，在政治思想工作和生产建设上都取得了很大的成绩。通过这一年的再实践，广大职工进一步明确地认识到：办好国营农场的决定关键，是用毛泽东思想来统帅国营农场的一切工作，从我国的实际情况出发，坚定地走自己的道路。
    会议在肯定各地国营农场取得上述成绩的同时，也指出了农垦工作中存在的问题和缺点，主要是：有一部分农场在工作中政治还突出得不够，生产水平还不高，农田基本建设还不过硬，耕作技术还较粗放，等等。会议指出，在第三个五年计划期间，必须在发扬成绩的基础上克服缺点，大力提高粮食、棉花等作物的单位面积产量，争取早日达到和超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标，并且积极发展畜牧业，为国家提供更多的畜产品。同时，各地农垦部门还要继续贯彻执行两种劳动制度和两种教育制度。
    与会代表通过对去年经验的认真总结，结合学习了焦裕禄同志的模范事迹和农垦系统六位活学活用毛主席著作积极分子的报告，一致认为，实现上述任务的根本关键，是用毛泽东思想统帅一切，在各项工作中突出政治，促进职工思想和工作不断革命化。会议指出，今后要特别注意以下几个方面：
    第一，进一步开展学习毛主席著作的运动，把毛主席著作当做各项工作的最高指示，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。
    第二，把社会主义教育运动搞深搞透。各农场都要坚持以阶级斗争为纲，抓好社会主义同资本主义两条道路、两种思想的斗争，用社会主义的思想和社会主义的方法，办好社会主义的农场。
    第三，切实加强经常性的政治工作，特别是要把政治工作落实到生产队，人人做政治工作，把生产队的政治工作切实加强起来。
    第四，坚决贯彻党中央和国务院有关农垦工作的方针政策，继续改进各项规章制度，彻底打破经营管理上各种洋框框与旧框框的束缚，进一步解放生产力，并认真总结经验，不断地有所发现、有所发明、有所创造、有所前进。
    参加这次会议的，有全国二十八个省、市、自治区农垦部门和农垦部直属垦区的代表，共一百多人。
