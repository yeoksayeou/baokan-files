    Learning Dialectics in Struggle

    A historic transformation is taking place on the Qinghai Plateau in western China. Animal husbandry is developing rapidly, grain production has begun to be more than self-sufficient, and an excellent situation has emerged. This is the result of the self-reliance and hard work of the people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai under the leadership of the Party, and the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

    Nature and history have imposed harsh conditions on this high-altitude, cold region. However, the comrades in Qinghai said it well: "We are doing revolutionary transformation work." They led and united the people of all ethnic groups, studied and applied materialist dialectics, took class struggle as the key link, and specifically analyzed and understood Qinghai. They grasped the main contradictions in Qinghai, educated cadres and the masses, and saw the direction of progress clearly in the face of difficulties. With revolutionary spirit, they promoted the transformation of things and transformed Qinghai.

    "All ideas that are based on and conform to objective facts are correct ideas, and all actions or behaviors based on correct ideas are correct actions." In the process of transforming the objective world, the comrades in Qinghai earnestly studied and applied these teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, and through investigation and research, based on objective reality, determined the principles and plans for transforming Qinghai.

    Materialist dialectics is the world outlook of revolutionaries. It not only teaches people to correctly understand the objective, but more importantly, it teaches people to give play to the subjective initiative of revolutionaries according to the inherent dialectics of things, promote the transformation of things, and achieve revolutionary goals. In recent years, the comrades in Qinghai have used the viewpoint of "one divides into two" to see the favorable factors in unfavorable conditions and establish the confidence to win in the face of difficulties. They have both revolutionary courage and a pragmatic spirit; both lofty ideals and down-to-earth hard work. They have seized various practical and effective measures for water conservancy construction in light of local conditions, creating conditions to change the arid face of the plateau. They have studied the specific local conditions and seized key measures such as improving sheep breeds, eradicating rats from grasslands, and other key measures, creating favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry. They started from "one," "fighting for one point of land," "protecting one sheep," "killing one wolf," "doing a good job in one production team," and "grasping the mobilization of each household," working step by step and bit by bit. It is this revolutionary spirit that has become a tremendous material force.

    The process of transforming Qinghai is a process of struggle against various erroneous ideas. The Qinghai Provincial Party Committee frequently organizes cadres at all levels to study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong, and frequently uses Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres at all levels, addressing the living thoughts of cadres and promptly adopting the methods of "pointing, knocking, helping, and guiding" to struggle against various conservative and backward thoughts, viewpoints, traditions, and habits, and to struggle against various metaphysical viewpoints. Only in this way can we transform the subjective world of cadres in the process of transforming the objective world, so that cadres always maintain a clear mind and vigorous energy, and learn and apply dialectics in struggle.

    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The history of mankind is a history of continuous development from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom." In recent years, the comrades in Qinghai have relied on Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful spiritual weapon, to understand and transform Qinghai. Practice has shown that their understanding of Qinghai has taken a big step forward from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of freedom." Of course, a large part of the "realm of necessity" still lies before them, waiting to be further explored and understood. We believe that the comrades in Qinghai will continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, and constantly sum up experience. Their work will inevitably develop and progress. It can be expected that in the near future, the face of the Qinghai Plateau will undergo even greater changes.

    在斗争中学习辩证法
    我国西部青海高原，正在发生着历史性的巨变。牧畜业迅速发展，粮食开始自给有余，出现了一片大好形势。这是青海各族人民在党领导下自力更生、艰苦奋斗的结果，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    自然和历史给予这个高寒地区的条件是苛刻的。但是，青海的同志们说得好：“我们就是做革命的转化工作的。”他们领导和团结了各族人民，学习和运用唯物辩证法，以阶级斗争为纲，具体地分析青海，认识青海。他们把握了青海的主要矛盾，教育干部和群众，从困难中看清了前进的方向。他们以革命的精神，促成事物的转化，改造着青海。
    “一切根据和符合于客观事实的思想是正确的思想，一切根据于正确思想的做或行动是正确的行动。”青海的同志们在改造客观世界的过程中，认真学习和运用毛泽东同志这些教导，通过调查研究，根据客观实际，确定了改造青海的方针、计划。
    唯物辩证法是革命者的宇宙观，它不仅教人正确地认识客观，更重要的是教人按照事物本来的辩证法，发挥革命者的主观能动作用，促进事物的转化，达到革命的目的。几年来，青海的同志们运用一分为二的观点，在不利条件下看到了有利因素，在困难中树立了必胜信心。他们既有革命的胆略，又有求实的精神；既有远大的理想，又有脚踏实地的干劲。他们因地制宜地抓住了水利建设的种种切实有效的措施，创造条件，改变高原干旱的面貌。他们研究当地具体情况，抓住了改良羊种、草原灭鼠以及其它一些关键性措施，为牧畜业发展创造了有利条件。他们从“一”抓起，“争一分地”，“保一只羊”，“打一只狼”，“搞好一个生产队”，“抓一家一户的发动”，一步一个脚印，一点一滴地工作。正是这种革命精神，变成了巨大的物质力量。
    改造青海的过程，是同各种各样错误思想斗争的过程。青海省委经常组织各级干部学习毛泽东同志的著作，经常用毛泽东思想教育各级干部，针对干部的活思想，及时采取“点、敲、帮、引”的作法，同各种保守的落后的思想、观点、传统和习惯作斗争，同各种形而上学的观点作斗争。只有这样，才能在改造客观世界的过程中，改造干部的主观世界，使干部永远保持清醒的头脑，充沛的干劲，在斗争中学习辩证法，运用辩证法。
    毛泽东同志说：“人类的历史，就是一个不断地从必然王国向自由王国发展的历史。”青海的同志们几年来依靠毛泽东思想这个强大的精神武器，认识青海，改造青海。实践表明，他们对于青海的认识，已经从“必然王国”向“自由王国”前进了一大步。当然，在他们面前还有很大部分的“必然王国”，有待于继续探索，继续认识。我们相信，青海的同志们，继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，不断地总结经验，他们的工作，必然会有所发展，有所前进。可以预期，在不远的将来，青海高原的面貌，将会有更大的改变。
