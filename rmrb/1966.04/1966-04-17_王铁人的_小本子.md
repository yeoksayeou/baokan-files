    Wang Tie's "Little Notebook"
    Zhao Qing
    Daqing "Iron Man" Wang Jinxi said: "Achievements should be recorded in the Party's account, in Chairman Mao's account, and in the account of the people of the whole country; I can only have a little notebook to record shortcomings."
    These few words show how our labor heroes view the revolutionary cause and how they demand of themselves.
    The magnificent epic of our socialist revolution and socialist construction is written with Mao Zedong Thought, and it is created by the people of the whole country working hard, uniting as one, and striving forward under the leadership of the Party. Every revolutionary of ours has put in their hard work at different posts for this great cause, adding a punctuation mark, or a sentence or line, to the revolutionary epic. However, without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought and without the collective efforts of all the people, it would not be possible to form sentences or lines. Those who truly understand how the revolutionary epic of our era is written will never hide a personal "book of merits" in their pockets.
    Our era is advancing a thousand miles a day with the force of thunder. Everyone must make a choice between being at the forefront of the times and being a promoter of the revolution, or falling behind the times and being an onlooker or retarder of the revolution. To keep up with the pace of the times, we must constantly use the "one divides into two" viewpoint, see our own shortcomings in progress, and strive to shorten the gap. A thorough revolutionary cannot be without a "notebook for recording shortcomings" in their pocket.
    A personal "book of merits" is unnecessary, but a personal "notebook of shortcomings" is indispensable. One without, one with, both come from the idea of "serving the people wholeheartedly." Our heroic figures armed with Mao Zedong Thought all have this one-without-one-with characteristic. Comrade Wang Jinxi is like this, Comrade Lei Feng is like this, Comrade Wang Jie is like this, and Comrade Jiao Yulu is also like this.

    王铁人的“小本子”
    赵擎
    大庆“铁人”王进喜同志说：“成绩要记在党的账上，记在毛主席的账上，记在全国人民的账上，我只能有个小本子记差距。”
    寥寥数语，表现出我们的劳动英雄是怎样看待革命事业和怎样要求自己的。
    我们的社会主义革命和社会主义建设的壮丽诗篇，是用毛泽东思想来写的，是全国人民在党的领导下奋发图强、同心协力所创作的。我们每一个革命者都在不同的岗位上，为这伟大事业付出了自己的辛勤劳动，给革命史诗增添了一个标点符号，或一句一行。但是，如果没有毛泽东思想的指引，没有全体人民的集体努力，就不能成句成行。真正懂得我们时代的革命诗篇是怎样写的人，他怀里决不会夹藏着一本个人的“功勋簿”。
    我们的时代，正以雷霆万钧之势日行千里。究竟是赶在时代的前头，作革命的促进派，还是落在时代的后面，作革命的旁观派或促退派，每个人必须对此作出抉择。要赶上时代前进的步伐，就必须经常运用“一分为二”的观点，在前进中看见自己的差距，并努力来缩短差距。一个彻底的革命者，口袋中不能没有一个“记差距”的小本子。
    个人的“功勋簿”不能有，个人的“差距本”不可无。一无一有，都来自“全心全意为人民服务”这个思想。我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的英雄人物，都具有这一无一有的特点。王进喜同志是这样，雷锋同志是这样，王杰同志是这样，焦裕禄同志也是这样。
