    To truly realize democratic centralism, the key lies in the top leaders of Party committees at all levels. According to my experience, the most important thing is to correctly position yourself. Do you place yourself among the masses, or above them? In pursuing revolutionization, do you start with revolutionizing yourself, or revolutionizing others first? In creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, do you prioritize transforming your own thinking, or simply use them to transform others? If this position is not correctly established, if one considers oneself a leader, the mass viewpoint will inevitably be weakened, and one will inevitably become self-righteous.
    The top leader must place himself within the collective leadership and among the masses, adhere to the principle of the minority submitting to the majority, and appear as an ordinary laborer at all times and in all matters. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and accepting the supervision of the masses are the foundations of a responsible cadre's democratic style. This is also a matter of a revolutionary's worldview. Only with the same unwavering loyalty as Comrade Jiao Yulu, who "had the entire people in his heart, but only not himself," can one firmly believe in and rely on the masses. Therefore, I believe that correctly positioning oneself is an important prerequisite for implementing democratic centralism.

### 把自己的位置摆对头

    把自己的位置摆对头
    要真正实现民主集中制，关键在于各级党委的第一把手。根据我的体会，最主要的是，要把自己的位置摆对头。是把自己放在群众之中，还是放在群众之上？革命化，是先从自己化起，还是先化别人？活学活用毛主席著作，首先是改造自己的思想，还只是为了改造别人？这个位置摆不对头，以领导者自居，群众观点必然淡薄，必然自以为是。
    第一把手必须把自己置于集体领导之中、群众之中，坚持少数服从多数的原则，时时事事以一个普通劳动者出现。相信群众、依靠群众，接受群众监督，是一个负责干部具有民主作风的基础。这也是一个革命者的世界观问题。只有象焦裕禄同志那样“心里装着全体人民，唯独没有自己”的赤胆忠心，才能坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众。因此，我认为摆对位置是实行民主集中制的重要前提。
