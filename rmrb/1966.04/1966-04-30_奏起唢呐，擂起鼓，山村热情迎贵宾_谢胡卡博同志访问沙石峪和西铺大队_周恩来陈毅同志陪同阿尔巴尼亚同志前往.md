    Suonas Sound, Drums Beat, Mountain Village Warmly Welcomes Distinguished Guests
    Comrade Shehu and Comrade Kaba Visit the Shashi Yu and Xipu Brigades
    Comrades Zhou Enlai and Chen Yi Accompany Albanian Comrades on Their Visit
    During the visit, Comrade Shehu said: "From here, we see that Mao Zedong's great thought has been transformed into a socialist material force. As comrades, we love you from the bottom of our hearts."
    Xinhua News Agency, 29th - Chairman Shehu and all comrades of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by him, today took a helicopter to Hebei Province's Zunhua County, a nationally renowned agricultural model of the Dazhai type, and visited the Shashi Yu Brigade of the Yuegezhuang Commune, known as "contemporary living Yugong" for their persistence in opening mountains to create fields, and the Xipu Brigade of the Jianming Commune, which adhered to the "poor stick" spirit and took the road of collectivization.
    The visit of the Albanian distinguished guests to Shashi Yu made this remote mountain village as lively as a festival. The commune members all said: "This is the glory of our village, a great happy event!" The walls of the village were plastered with red and green welcome slogans. The "iron men," "iron women," and "iron wives" who were opening up mountains to create fields, the white-haired old men and grandmothers, and the primary school students wearing red scarves, enthusiastically gathered at the entrance of the village, waving the national flags of China and Albania, to welcome the Albanian comrades as guests.
    At noon, the helicopter carrying Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kaba, and Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Chen Yi who accompanied them, landed on a flat ground in front of the village. At this time, the young men beat the drums, and the "old hands" of rural entertainment activities played "Socialism is Good" on the suona. Comrade Shehu and Comrade Kaba, etc., embraced Zhang Guishun, the secretary of the brigade party branch, Yan Baoyu, the captain of the brigade, Li Yongfa, the chairman of the poor and lower-middle peasants association, and Yan Yuping, the secretary of the Youth League branch. The fifty-four-year-old Zhang Guishun's face blossomed with smiles, and he said repeatedly: "Chairman Shehu, all our commune members welcome you, welcome you!" Comrade Shehu, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and Zhang Guishun, etc., walked arm in arm towards the welcoming crowd. The commune members shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" Many pairs of thick-calloused hands reached out, vying to shake hands with the distinguished guests and Premier Zhou. The enthusiastic sound of gongs and drums, the cordial greetings, and the continuous applause resounded as one, and the entire mountain village suddenly became hot and lively.
    Subsequently, Comrade Shehu, etc., walked up the hillside behind the village to visit the commune members' terraced fields. Zhang Guishun introduced the commune members' experience of self-reliance and hard work to the Albanian comrades. The location of this brigade is all stone mountains, with thin soil and lack of water, described as a place where "soil is like pearls and water is like oil, and there are large stones all over the mountains." Here, there is a lack of water, and people must transport water from places five or six miles away. However, they did not bow their heads to difficulties, insisted on self-reliance, and struggled hard with the perseverance of "Yugong removing mountains." The commune members used their industrious hands to cut the stone mountains into many steps and transported soil from places five miles or even twenty miles away to create terraced fields. They relied on "shoulders above and feet below." During the eighty-three consecutive days of drought last year, the entire brigade's labor force walked a total of 410,000 miles to carry water to fight the drought, and finally won an average grain yield of 560 jin per mu.
    Listening to these introductions, Comrade Shehu patted Zhang Guishun's shoulder and said with emotion: "You are truly heroes! You are harder than stone!" Comrade Zhou Enlai, who was standing next to him, pointed to the large characters "Learn from Dazhai, catch up with Dazhai, surpass Dazhai" inlaid with stones on the mountain opposite and showed them to Comrade Shehu, and encouraged the commune members to say that the more difficult the place, the greater the enthusiasm. He hoped that they would be more humble and make greater achievements.
    Beside a reservoir on the hillside, the commune members used walnuts and red dates they grew themselves to treat the distinguished guests. Chinese and Albanian comrades sat together for cordial talks. Looking at the surrounding terraced fields, Comrade Shehu said to everyone: "The place we visited today is a university. This is the most precious gift you have given us." Comrade Zhou Enlai said: "This is also our university." Comrade Shehu said: "From here, we see that Mao Zedong's great thought has been transformed into a socialist material force. As comrades, we love you from the bottom of our hearts."
    Comrade Shehu also said that 85% of Albania's area is mountainous, and Albania used to be the poorest country in Europe. After twenty years of socialist construction, it is no longer the poorest country. As long as the stone mountains are turned into fertile fields, Albania will become a rich and strong country in Europe.
    Here, Comrade Shehu, on behalf of the Albanian cooperative farmers, presented a banner to the Shashi Yu Brigade. At this time, Chinese and Albanian comrades applauded warmly, and Comrade Zhou Enlai warmly embraced Comrade Shehu. Zhang Guishun said excitedly after receiving the banner from Comrade Shehu: "The Albanian comrades' visit here has given us great encouragement. What we have done is far from enough. We must work hard to learn the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people and carry the revolution through to the end." Comrade Shehu continued: "The people of China and Albania have a deep revolutionary friendship. The unity between China and Albania is a Great Wall that imperialism and modern revisionism cannot surmount!"
    After saying goodbye to the people of Shashi Yu who were transforming the world, Chairman Shehu and other distinguished guests came to the nearby Xipu Brigade of the Jianming Commune. This is also a nationally renowned place. The commune members here, especially a group of poor peasant commune members, listened wholeheartedly to the Party during the period of agricultural cooperation and persisted in implementing the policy of diligence and thrift in running the commune. They established a "poor stick" cooperative with only "three donkey legs." In 1955, Chairman Mao wrote an annotation for the article introducing this cooperative in the book "Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside," praising them as "the image of our entire country." The commune members of this cooperative are constantly making revolution. Today, they have achieved great success in all aspects.
    In the exhibition room introducing the history of Xipu Village and the cooperative, Wang Guofan, a representative of the National People's Congress, the director of the Jianming Commune, and the secretary of the Xipu Brigade Party Branch, introduced to Comrade Shehu and Comrade Kaba the situation of their persistence in grasping class struggle and developing collective production with the spirit of being poor and working hard on the road of collectivization. The distinguished guests also met with poor peasant commune members Wang Sheng and Wang Rong. In the old society, one of them begged for food for twenty-four years, and the other begged for food for eight years. They were the strong backbone of the "poor stick" cooperative in those years. Wang Guofan said: "At that time, some wealthy people ridiculed us as a 'poor stick' cooperative, saying that we would definitely become poor and 'scatter' in the future. But we were poor but ambitious and persisted in taking the road of cooperation. Now we have developed in all aspects."
    After fourteen years of struggle, this commune has undergone tremendous changes. Now, the grain yield per mu has increased from more than 150 jin in the past to more than 500 jin; the original grain-deficient commune has become a surplus-grain commune, averaging more than 1.72 million jin of grain sold to the state every year for nearly ten years; in the past, there was no irrigated land, but now nearly one-third of the cultivated land can be irrigated; afforestation has increased twice as much as in 1955, and fruit trees have increased one and a half times; large livestock have increased by 40% compared to ten years ago. The Xipu Brigade, which only had one person who could write accounting "codes" and two middle school students who were the children of landlords and rich peasants, now has dozens of people who have reached middle school education. This spring, the Jianming Commune has sown more than 5,000 mu of grain crops, which is not only faster than the same period last year, but also of better quality. All 2,300 mu of wheat fields in the commune have been watered once, fertilized once, and loosened once. Judging from the growth, there is great hope for increased production. The commune members here say, "If we can walk on our own, we will never rely on others to support us."
    Comrade Shehu praised them for doing a good job and shook hands tightly with Wang Guofan, Wang Sheng, and Wang Rong. Comrade Kaba stood up and said: "No matter who listens to your introduction, they will feel encouraged. We wish you continued efforts to fulfill the tasks Comrade Mao Zedong set for you and strive for greater achievements!" He presented a photo album reflecting the achievements of Albania's revolutionary measures to the Jianming Commune on behalf of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation.
    Walking out of the exhibition room, the commune members and students who had just lined up to welcome the distinguished guests were gathering on the street, applauding and singing to pay their respects to Comrade Shehu and other distinguished guests. Comrade Shehu, Comrade Kaba, Comrade Zhou Enlai, and Comrade Chen Yi, walked into the welcoming crowd and sang the Albanian song "Eagle of the Guerrillas" and the Chinese song "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" with everyone. The cordial meeting always kept everyone's feelings closely connected.
    The Xipu Brigade used millet porridge, cornmeal cakes, old tofu, and other home-cooked meals to entertain Comrade Shehu and other distinguished guests. Wang Guofan, Wang Sheng, and Wang Rong accompanied the leaders of China and Albania, eating at one table, and everyone talked cordially, gathering together like family. After the meal, Comrade Shehu and Comrade Zhou Enlai, etc., went to Wang Sheng's home as guests and visited the thatched shed he lived in in the past and the newly built brick house. Wang Sheng said that we want to keep this thatched shed so that future generations will never forget the bitter days of the old society. Comrade Shehu and Comrade Zhou Enlai praised the old poor peasant's arrangement, saying that he did it very well, and took a group photo with Wang Sheng's family in front of the new house. When Comrade Shehu and others left Wang Sheng's home and walked out of Xipu, the commune members warmly sent them off, hoping that the distinguished guests would bring their friendship to the Albanian cooperative farmers and all the Albanian people.
    Today, Wang Bingnan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Xu Jianguo, China's Ambassador to Albania, Li Weixin, Deputy Secretary of the Tangshan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and Commissioner of the Tangshan Prefecture, etc., also accompanied all the comrades of the Albanian Party and Government Delegation on their visit. Before the visit, Chang Yumin, Acting Secretary of the Zunhua County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, introduced the situation of Zunhua County's socialist revolution and construction to the distinguished guests.

    奏起唢呐，擂起鼓，山村热情迎贵宾
    谢胡卡博同志访问沙石峪和西铺大队
    周恩来陈毅同志陪同阿尔巴尼亚同志前往
    谢胡同志在访问中说：“从这里我们看到，毛泽东的伟大思想已化为社会主义的物质力量。我们作为同志，从心里热爱你们。”
    新华社二十九日讯　谢胡主席和由他率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志，今天乘直升飞机到全国闻名的大寨式农业典型单位之一的河北省遵化县，访问了坚持开山造田、被人们称为“当代活愚公”的岳各庄公社沙石峪大队，和坚持“穷棒子”办社精神走集体化道路的建明公社西铺大队。
    阿尔巴尼亚贵宾们访问沙石峪，使这个偏僻山村热闹得象过节一样，社员们都说：“这是我们村的光荣，是一件大喜事！”村中墙壁上贴着红红绿绿的欢迎标语，开山造田中的“铁汉子”、“铁姑娘”和
  “铁大嫂”们，白发的老大爷、老奶奶，系着红领巾的小学生，热情洋溢地汇集在村头，挥动着中阿两国国旗，欢迎阿尔巴尼亚战友来作客。
    中午时分，直升飞机载着谢胡同志、卡博同志和陪同他们来访的周恩来同志和陈毅同志，降落在村前的一块平地上。这时候，小伙子们擂起鼓，农村文娱活动的“老把式”用唢呐吹奏起《社会主义好》。谢胡同志和卡博等同志见到大队党支部书记张贵顺，大队长阎宝玉、贫下中农协会主席李永发和团支部书记阎玉苹等，亲切地拥抱他们。五十四岁的张贵顺脸上笑开了花，连着说：“谢胡主席，我们全体社员欢迎你们，欢迎你们！”谢胡同志、周恩来同志和张贵顺等人，手臂挽着手臂，向欢迎的人群走去。社员们高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”多少双长着厚茧的手伸了过来，争着要同贵宾们和周总理握手。热烈的锣鼓声、亲切的问候声和不断的鼓掌声，响成一片，整个山村顿时显得热气腾腾，分外热闹。
    随后，谢胡同志等走上村后的山坡，参观社员们的梯田。张贵顺向阿尔巴尼亚同志介绍了公社社员自力更生艰苦创业的经历。这个大队的所在地全是石山，土薄缺水，被人们形容为“土如珍珠水如油，满山遍野大石头”的地方。这里缺水，人们必须从五、六里路以外的地方运水来。但是，他们不向困难低头，坚持自力更生，以“愚公移山”的毅力，艰苦奋斗。社员们用勤劳的双手，硬是把一座座石山削成许多梯级，从五里路甚至二十里路以外的地方，挑来泥土造成梯田。他们“上靠肩膀，下靠脚掌”，在去年连续八十三天的大旱中，全大队的劳动力，累计走了四十一万里的路挑水抗旱，终于夺得粮食平均亩产五百六十斤的收成。
    谢胡同志听着这些介绍，拍着张贵顺的肩膀，感动地说：“你们真是英雄好汉！你们比石头还坚硬！”站在旁边的周恩来同志指着对面山上用石头嵌砌的“学大寨、赶大寨、超大寨”几个大字给谢胡同志看，并且鼓励社员们说，愈是苦的地方干劲愈大，希望你们更加谦虚，作出更大的成绩。
    在山腰一座蓄水池旁，社员们用他们自己种的核桃和红枣款待贵宾。中阿两国同志坐在一起亲切交谈。谢胡同志看着四周的梯田对大家说：“今天我们参观的这地方是一所大学，这是你们给我们最珍贵的礼物。”周恩来同志说：“这也是我们的大学。”谢胡同志说：“从这里我们看到，毛泽东的伟大思想已化为社会主义的物质力量。我们作为同志，从心里热爱你们。”
    谢胡同志还说，阿尔巴尼亚百分之八十五的面积是山区，阿尔巴尼亚曾经是欧洲最穷的国家，经过二十年来的社会主义建设，现在已经不是最穷的国家了，只要把石山都造成良田，阿尔巴尼亚就会成为欧洲富强的国家。
    在这里，谢胡同志代表阿尔巴尼亚合作化的农民，把一面锦旗赠给沙石峪大队。这时，中阿两国同志热烈鼓掌，周恩来同志热情地拥抱了谢胡同志。张贵顺同志从谢胡同志手里接过锦旗后激动地说：“阿尔巴尼亚同志这次来我们这里，给了我们很大的鼓励。我们做得还很不够，我们一定努力学习阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命精神，把革命进行到底。”谢胡同志接着说：“阿中两国人民有着深厚的革命友谊，阿中两国的团结是帝国主义和现代修正主义不可逾越的长城！”
    告别了改天换地的沙石峪人，谢胡主席等贵宾又来到附近的建明公社西铺大队。这同样是一个闻名全国的地方，这里的社员特别是一批贫农社员，在实现农业合作化时期，一心听党的话，坚持执行勤俭办社的方针，办起了只有“三条驴腿”的“穷棒子”社。一九五五年，毛主席在《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书中，为介绍这个社的文章写了按语，表扬他们是“我们整个国家的形象”。这个社的社员们不断革命，到今天他们在各方面都取得了很大的成绩。
    在介绍西铺村史和社史的展览室里，全国人大代表、建明公社社长、西铺大队党支部书记王国藩，向谢胡同志和卡博等同志介绍了他们在集体化道路上坚持抓阶级斗争，用穷干苦干精神发展集体生产的情况。贵宾们在这里还会见了贫农社员王生和王荣，在旧社会里，他们俩一个讨了二十四年饭，一个讨了八年饭，是当年“穷棒子”社的坚强骨干。王国藩说：“那时候，一些富裕的人讥笑我们是‘穷棒子’社，将来一定要穷‘散’，可是我们穷得有志气，坚持走合作化道路，现在我们各方面都发展了。”
    这个公社经过十四年的奋斗，已经发生了巨大的变化，现在，粮食亩产由过去的一百五十多斤提高到五百多斤；原来的缺粮社变成余粮社，近十年来平均每年交售给国家一百七十二万多斤粮食；过去没有水浇地，现在有近三分之一的耕地可以灌溉；植树造林比一九五五年增长了两倍，果树增长了一倍半；大牲畜比十年前增加了百分之四十。当年只有一人会写记账的“码子”、有两名中学生都是地主、富农子弟的西铺大队，如今有几十人达到中学文化程度。今春建明公社已播种粮食作物五千多亩，不仅比去年同期进度快，而且质量好。全社二千三百多亩麦田，全部浇了一次水，追了一次肥，松了一次土，从生长情况看，增产大有希望。这里的社员们说“能自己走，就绝不靠别人扶”。
    谢胡同志称赞他们干得好，和王国藩、王生、王荣紧紧握手。卡博同志站起来说：“不管谁听了你们的介绍，都会感到鼓舞。我们祝你们继续努力，实现毛泽东同志为你们提出的任务，争取更大的成就！”他以阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团的名义向建明公社赠送了一本反映阿尔巴尼亚革命化措施的成就的相册。
    走出展览室，刚才夹道欢迎贵宾的社员和学生们，正聚集在街头上鼓掌和唱歌，向谢胡同志等贵宾致意。谢胡同志、卡博同志、周恩来同志和陈毅同志，走进欢迎的人群，同大家一起唱了阿尔巴尼亚歌曲《游击队之鹰》和中国歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》。亲切的会见始终把大家的感情紧紧联系在一起。
    西铺大队用小米粥、玉米面饼、老豆腐等家常饭招待谢胡同志等贵宾。王国藩、王生、王荣陪着中阿两国领导人，在一张桌上用餐，大家亲切交谈，就象家人一样欢聚。饭后，谢胡同志和周恩来同志等，又到王生家去作客，并且参观了他在过去住的茅棚和新盖的砖瓦房。王生说，我们要把这顶茅棚留下，要让后代永远不忘记旧社会的苦日子。谢胡同志和周恩来同志称赞了这位老贫农的安排，说他这样做很对，并且和王生一家人在新房前合影留念。谢胡同志等离开王生的家，走出西铺时，社员们热烈欢送，希望贵宾们把他们的情谊带给合作化的阿尔巴尼亚农民和全体阿尔巴尼亚人民。
    今天，陪同阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团全体同志参观访问的，还有外交部副部长王炳南，我国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使许建国，中共河北省唐山地委副书记、唐山专区专员李维新等。在参观之前，中共遵化县委代理书记常郁民向贵宾们介绍了遵化县进行社会主义革命和建设的情况。（附图片）
