    Editor's Note: Grasping politics every day and grasping politics forever is an important conclusion drawn from the Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee's political work conference.
    Do you really want to achieve or exceed the targets stipulated in the National Programme for Agricultural Development? It depends on whether you genuinely want it or just pretend. If you genuinely want it, you must firmly grasp class struggle to promote the struggle for production. Leaving aside class struggle as the key, if you only focus on production for production's sake, only rewarding materials, giving more work points, and urging plowing and sowing, things will go in the opposite direction and, in effect, it will be a mere pretense. Such practices will allow capitalist ideas that only care for the individual and not for the collective or the state to grow. Even if grain production goes up temporarily, it will eventually fall again.
    Why haven't many comrades been aware of this problem for a long time? Many county party secretaries put it well: they have forgotten class struggle and have not grasped the fundamental issue of highlighting politics. In this way, they not only fail to see the contradictions between ourselves and the enemy but also fail to see the class struggle manifested through a large number of contradictions among the people. Looking at problems and handling problems, forgetting class struggle inevitably leads to losing direction and going astray.
    Is highlighting politics as difficult as some people think? After discussions at the conference, people answered that it is not that difficult. As long as we overcome blindness, raise awareness, and clarify our thinking, solutions will emerge. This means firmly grasping a proletarian political yardstick in all our work and using it to measure people, measure thoughts, and measure production. How can we grasp this yardstick and use it well? The fundamental of fundamentals is to diligently study the works of Comrade Mao Zedong.
    According to the Henan Daily: The Xinxiang Prefectural Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a political work conference. County and municipal party secretaries and leaders of the prefectural party committee's base point work teams participating in the conference discussed how to highlight politics and promote production through revolution. Through discussion, everyone enhanced their awareness of highlighting politics. They unanimously stated that they must more consciously study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way in the future, never forgetting class struggle, never forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat, never forgetting relying on the poor and lower-middle peasants, never forgetting the Party's policies, and never forgetting the Party's work, to make greater contributions to accelerating the development of China's socialist revolution and construction and to supporting the world revolution.

    Grasping Politics as the "Key" is Necessary for Production to Increase

    Currently, the broad masses of rural commune members and cadres have a strong desire to change the backward state of agriculture and realize the targets stipulated in the National Programme for Agricultural Development as soon as possible. How can we transform this powerful spiritual force into a material force? Comrades participating in the conference believe that in guiding ideology and leadership work, we must correctly position politics and production and truly achieve promoting production through revolution, with politics commanding production. Some comrades said that in the past, they spent the whole year urging collection and sowing, focusing solely on production, wanting only to increase production, but it just wouldn't increase. What's the reason? It's that the positions of politics and production were misplaced, and ideologically they deviated from the "key" of class struggle, so production couldn't increase.
    Feng Kelong, the second secretary of the Qinyang County Party Committee, used the changes in the Xishang Brigade to illustrate the great significance of highlighting politics. He said: The Xishang Brigade has good water conservancy and soil conditions, but in the past two years, because the commune members' awareness was not high and the direction of advance was not clear, paddy fields were planted as dry land, and the yield per unit area was always only two hundred catties, and the state had to sell five to six hundred thousand catties of grain to them every year. Some people engaged in capitalist activities and feudal superstitious activities in order to earn more money. Last year, the county party committee squatted here, carried out socialist education among the peasants, and mobilized the masses to expose and criticize capitalist ideas and behaviors, and stopped the black wind of capitalism. As a result, the same land, the same conditions, in last year's severe drought, still sold more than 500,000 catties of surplus grain to the state. This fact made the county party committee realize that only by highlighting politics and grasping the struggle between class struggle, socialism and capitalism can work and production be improved; without grasping politics, not only will production not be good, but capitalism will inevitably be produced.
    Zhang Xinwen, deputy secretary of the Bo'ai County Party Committee, used the example of accumulating fertilizer to introduce the experience of promoting production through revolution to make grain yield per mu meet the "National Programme." Their experience is: as long as the masses always think of socialism, everything is easy to handle. In the past, grassroots cadres and the masses had an old habit: they didn't accumulate fertilizer when planting, and only relied on buying chemical fertilizer. Although the county party committee made suggestions many times, they always had various "reasons" and were unwilling to accumulate fertilizer. Last year, as soon as socialist education was grasped, cadres and the masses were organized to study Chairman Mao's works, and the situation changed. Everyone initially established the idea of ​​self-reliance and farming for the revolution, and quickly launched a movement to rot grass fertilizer and raise pigs to accumulate fertilizer. In the past, there were only more than 6,000 pigs raised in the county, but last year it suddenly developed to more than 35,000, and farm manure was also collected and managed. In the past few years, the masses only wanted to rely on the state, and they were engaged in digging wells every year, but not many wells were dug; last year, they didn't ask the state for anything, but they completed 500 motor wells, and afforestation and drainage projects were also carried out accordingly.
    Gao Juntai, deputy secretary of the Jiaozuo Municipal Party Committee, compared the vivid facts of the Nantian Brigade's transformation from backward to advanced by implementing political command, and the Su Lin Brigade's transformation from advanced to backward by implementing work point command, and concluded that: politics commands production, and production obeys politics. If the position is corrected, bad conditions can be turned into good ones, low output can be turned into high output, and passive work can be turned into active work; on the contrary, advanced units that do not highlight politics will also turn from good to bad, from advanced to backward.

    Class Struggle During the Transition Period Permeates All Aspects of Social Life

    Everyone cited many facts to illustrate that class struggle and the struggle between two roads during the transition period permeate all aspects of social life. Whether it is agricultural production, sideline production, or cultural education and other work, we must not only grasp class struggle, but also grasp it frequently, continuously, and thoroughly.
    Li Linshu, secretary of the Wenxian County Party Committee, said that in the past, I simply understood class struggle as contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, but I couldn't see that a large amount of current class struggle is manifested through contradictions among the people. Therefore, in daily work, I only focused on production for production's sake. After studying Chairman Mao's expositions on classes and class struggle, I have a clearer understanding of the class struggle manifested in contradictions among the people. Taking sending manure as an example, from the phenomenon, it seems that there is no political problem, but in essence, it contains the struggle between highlighting proletarian politics and highlighting bourgeois politics. For example, some team cadres, when mobilizing commune members to topdress wheat, did not talk about the great significance of striving for a bumper wheat harvest in supporting socialist construction and world revolution, but only relied on work points, that is, using material incentives to mobilize commune members' enthusiasm. As a result, some people added more water to the thatched manure in order to earn more work points, and sent the good fertilizer to their private plots. After discovering this situation, the county party committee work team organized commune members to study Chairman Mao's quotations of "utter devotion to others without any thought of self," talked about the situation, talked about tasks, and talked about the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. After discussion, the commune members said: "If collective production is done well and socialist construction is accelerated, it is a guarantee for us to live a happy life." In this way, everyone worked hard for the collective, and some people automatically sent good fertilizer to the collective land. From this point of view, politics is everywhere. Once proletarian ideology is in command, the masses have a direction, have motivation, and can do a good job in everything, big and small.
    Wei Min, secretary of the Huojia County Party Committee, talked about the reasons why they could not highlight politics in everything in the past. He said: "In the past, there was a misconception that the work done by the county party committee was to highlight politics, but they had a very poor understanding of highlighting politics, which is to always and everywhere adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the command, that is, to grasp class struggle and promote the proletariat and eliminate capitalism. If the thinking does not go up, of course, the main force will not be used to grasp political and ideological work. If the leading cadres do not grasp politics firmly, the cadres below will not grasp politics even more. Since last year, with the deepening of the socialist education movement, the county party committee has improved its understanding, grasped the highlights of politics, and the cadres below have followed suit, and the county's work has improved.
    Wang Xingzheng, the second secretary of the Xinxiang County Party Committee, and Wang Qingbang, the secretary of the Suburban Committee of Jiaozuo City, respectively used examples of neglecting political and ideological work after the socialist education movement and the adverse consequences caused by alternately highlighting politics and production to illustrate: highlighting politics is by no means a one-time effort. If it is believed that after a socialist education movement or concentrating efforts to grasp a period of political and ideological work, all problems are solved and production can be grasped in isolation, it is a big mistake. This will not only fail to do a good job in production, but also runs the risk of losing the achievements of the previous political work and allowing capitalist evil winds to spread.
    The common view of the comrades participating in the conference is that whether or not to highlight proletarian politics and whether or not to grasp class struggle is a question of whether or not to make revolution, and it is a fundamental question related to the success or failure of the revolution. Every revolutionary cadre, especially leading cadres, must grasp politics every day, every time, and forever, and grasp it tightly and firmly in order to live up to the expectations of the Party and the people.

    Use the "Yardstick" of Proletarian Politics to Measure People, Measure Thoughts, and Measure Production

    The comrades participating in the conference believe that in doing revolution, especially leading cadres, they must have proletarian politics in their minds, and they must consider problems and handle problems from the proletarian political direction—the direction of socialism and communism. If we only talk about things as they are and only talk about production for production's sake, thinking that "good production" means good politics, we will lose our political direction and go down the wrong path. There must be standards for looking at things, and there must be yardsticks for measuring things. The "yardstick" we use to measure people, measure thoughts, and measure production is the "yardstick" of proletarian politics, socialism, and communism.
    Zhang Xinwen, deputy secretary of the Bo'ai County Party Committee, said: If we don't use the "yardstick" of politics to measure people, measure thoughts, and measure production, but unilaterally use the "yardstick" of output to measure people, measure thoughts, and measure production, we will cover up many major political problems and make people unable to grasp the correct political direction.
    For example, during the evaluation in February this year, it was because the leadership did not use the "yardstick" of proletarian politics to measure people, measure thoughts, and measure output, and issued certificates and rewards to a production brigade that had high output, but was selfish, only wanted to rely on state support, and was unwilling to sell the grain it produced to the state; another team of cadres and commune members had high awareness, were self-reliant and worked hard in everything, and contributed more to the state than the above brigade, but because the output was six catties lower, they did not win an award. As a result, the masses had a lot of opinions and said: "This is encouraging people to only care about themselves and not the country."
    Hao Yumen, secretary of the Fengqiu County Party Committee, and other comrades talked about their experience, saying that measuring people, measuring thoughts, and measuring production, using the political "yardstick" to measure, the more people measure, the stronger the proletarian spirit, and the more people who stand up for socialism; without highlighting politics, simply using the output "yardstick" to measure, the more people measure, the shorter their ambition, the heavier their selfishness, and the fewer people who stand up for socialism. Xi Guanghua, secretary of the Jixian County Party Committee, drew such a conclusion from the practice of squatting: if politics is not in command, the enthusiasm of the masses will not be fully mobilized; even if it is high for a while, it will not last, and the output cannot continue to rise, so-called good production is only temporary.

    Highlighting Politics Must Make Great Efforts to Transform the Worldview

    Comrades participating in the conference also talked about whether or not they can highlight politics in various tasks, the key lies in the leadership, and in the ideological revolutionization of the leadership. The central issue of ideological revolutionization is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way and make great efforts to transform the worldview.
    Fan Zhongsheng, secretary of the Yuanyang County Party Committee, said: To correctly position politics and production and highlight politics, we must always pay attention to transforming our thinking, so that our thinking gradually becomes proletarianized, and our minds are always filled with socialism and communism. If our thinking still remains at the stage of democratic revolution, and we use the thinking of democratic revolution to guide socialist revolution, we will have insufficient understanding of the situation of class struggle in the socialist period, and we will turn a blind eye to the complex and sharp class struggle. In this way, of course, we will not consciously grasp class struggle.
    Responsible comrades of the Fengqiu and Huojia County Party Committees said that to highlight politics, we must often go deep into reality, go deep into the masses, and enhance proletarian feelings. Otherwise, the concept of class struggle will become blurred, the political sense will slowly become dull, and we will not be able to consciously do the "human" work from a political perspective and give full play to the first role of human factors.
    Hao Yumen, secretary of the Fengqiu County Party Committee, said, if we ourselves do not have the idea of ​​farming for the revolution, how can we educate the peasants to farm for the revolution? If we ourselves have the idea of ​​small-scale peasant economy, how can we carry out collectivism and socialist education to the peasants? Therefore, to highlight politics, we must first revolutionize the leadership's thinking. Only when the leadership's thinking is revolutionized can it drive the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of cadres; and when the ideological revolutionization of the broad masses of cadres is realized, they can educate the broad masses of peasants with revolutionized thinking. The most fundamental thing in the so-called ideological revolutionization is to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate the bourgeois individualism.
    The comrades who attended the meeting talked about that to truly establish a proletarian worldview, we must completely eliminate the selfish and miscellaneous thoughts of bourgeois individualism in our minds. If "I" is in the lead, we will be short-sighted, unable to see the interests of the revolution, the interests of the people, and the bright future of communism, and we will not be able to embrace the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, and we will take some crooked ways to lead production, thus putting proletarian politics aside.

### 任何时候都不能忘记阶级斗争  新乡地委召开政治工作会议讨论突出政治的问题

    任何时候都不能忘记阶级斗争
    新乡地委召开政治工作会议讨论突出政治的问题
    编者按：天天抓政治，永远抓政治，这是新乡地委政治工作会议得出的一个重要结论。
    想要粮食达到和超过农业发展纲要规定的指标吗？看你是真想还是假想。如果你是真想，就必须紧紧抓住阶级斗争，来促进生产斗争。离开了阶级斗争这个纲，就生产抓生产，只是奖励物资，多给工分，催耕催种，事情就会走向反面，实际上就会是假想。那样的做法，就会使只顾个人，不顾集体，不顾国家的资本主义思想滋长起来。粮食即使一时上去了，最终还会掉下来的。
    为什么许多同志长期没有觉悟到这个问题呢？许多县委书记讲得好：就是忘掉了阶级斗争，没有抓住突出政治这个根本。这样，不但看不到敌我矛盾，也看不到通过大量人民内部矛盾表现出来的阶级斗争。看问题，处理问题，忘掉了阶级斗争，必然迷失方向，走到歧路上去。
    突出政治，是不是象有些人想的那么困难呢？人们经过会议的讨论，回答说，并不那么难。只要克服了盲目性，提高了自觉性，思想通了，办法也就有了。这就是在一切工作中牢牢掌握住一把无产阶级政治的尺子，用它去量人，量思想，量生产。怎样才能掌握这把尺子，用好这把尺子呢？根本的根本是努力学习毛泽东同志的著作。
    据河南日报报道：中共河南新乡地委，最近召开了政治工作会议。参加会议的县、市委书记和地委基点工作组组长，讨论了如何突出政治、抓革命促生产的问题。通过讨论，大家提高了突出政治的自觉性。一致表示：今后一定要更加自觉地活学活用毛主席的著作，在任何时候都不忘阶级斗争，不忘无产阶级专政，不忘依靠贫下中农，不忘党的政策，不忘党的工作，为加速我国社会主义革命和建设事业的发展，为支援世界革命，作出更大贡献。
    抓住政治这个“纲”，生产才能上去
    目前，农村广大社员群众和干部对改变农业落后面貌，尽快实现农业发展纲要规定的指标，有着强烈愿望。怎样才能把这种强大的精神力量变成物质力量呢？参加会议的同志认为：在领导思想和领导工作上，必须摆正政治和生产的位置，真正做到抓革命、促生产，以政治统帅生产。有些同志说，过去整年催收催种，就生产抓生产，光想叫生产上去，可就是上不去。原因在哪里？就是政治和生产的位置摆错了，思想上离开阶级斗争这条“纲”，生产也就上不去。
    沁阳县委第二书记冯克隆用西尚大队变化的事实，说明了突出政治的重大意义。他说：西尚大队的水利、土质都较好，可是前两年由于社员觉悟不高，前进方向不明确，水田当旱地种，单位面积产量老是二百多斤，每年吃国家五六十万斤统销粮食。有些人为了多赚钱，搞资本主义活动，搞封建迷信活动。去年县委在这里蹲点，向农民进行社会主义教育，发动群众揭发和批判资本主义思想行为，刹住了资本主义黑风。结果，同样的土地，同样的条件，在去年大旱之年，还向国家卖了五十多万斤余粮。这个事实使县委认识到：只有突出政治，狠抓阶级斗争、社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争，工作和生产才能上去；不抓政治，不仅生产搞不好，而且非产生资本主义不可。
    博爱县委副书记张新文以积肥为例，介绍了抓革命促生产，使粮食亩产上“纲要”的经验。他们的体会是：只要群众时时想到社会主义，啥事都好办。过去，基层干部和群众有个老习惯：种地不积肥，只靠买化肥。尽管县委多次提出建议，他们总是有种种“理由”，不愿积肥。去年一抓社会主义教育，组织干部和群众学习毛主席著作，情况就变了。大家初步树立了自力更生、为革命种田的思想，很快就开展起沤草肥和养猪积肥运动。过去，全县养猪只有六千多头，去年一下子发展到三万五千多头，农家肥料也收管起来了。前几年，群众光想依赖国家，年年抓打井，井却打的不多；去年，什么也没有向国家要，却打成了五百眼机井，造林、除涝工程也随着搞起来了。
    焦作市委副书记高钧泰以南墙大队实行政治挂帅由落后变先进，苏蔺大队实行工分挂帅由先进变落后的生动事实作对比，得出结论说：政治统帅生产，生产服从政治，这个位置摆正了，条件坏能变好，产量低能变高，工作被动能变主动；反之，先进单位不突出政治，也会由好变坏，由先进变落后。
    过渡时期的阶级斗争，渗透在社会生活的各个方面
    大家摆出许多事实说明，过渡时期的阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争，渗透在社会生活的各个方面。不管搞农业生产，搞副业生产，还是搞文化教育等其他工作，不但要抓阶级斗争，而且要经常抓，不断抓，一抓到底。
    温县县委书记李林树说，过去我把阶级斗争简单地理解为敌我矛盾，而看不到当前大量的阶级斗争是通过人民内部矛盾表现出来的。因此，在日常工作中只是就生产抓生产。经过学习毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，对人民内部矛盾中表现出来的阶级斗争，才有了比较明确的认识。就拿送粪来说，从现象上看，好象不存在什么政治问题，实质上却包含有是突出无产阶级政治还是突出资产阶级政治的斗争。如有的队干部在发动社员给小麦追肥时，不讲争取小麦丰收对支援社会主义建设和世界革命的重大意义，只靠用工分，也就是用物质刺激去调动社员积极性。结果有些人为了多挣工分，往茅粪里多掺水，而把好肥送到自留地去。县委工作组发现了这个情况后，就组织社员学习了毛主席“毫不利己，专门利人”的语录，讲形势，讲任务，讲国家、集体和个人的关系。经过讨论，社员们说：“集体生产搞好了，社会主义建设加快了，才是咱们过幸福生活的保证。”这样，大家都往集体上使劲了，有些人自动把好肥送到集体地里。由此看来，政治处处有，无产阶级思想一挂帅，群众就有了方向，有了干劲，大事小事都能干好。
    获嘉县委书记魏民谈到了他们过去不能事事处处突出政治的原因。他说：“过去有一种错觉，认为县委做的工作就是突出政治，而对突出政治就是时时处处坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，就是抓阶级斗争、兴无灭资，理解很差。思想上不去，当然就不会把主要力量用于抓政治思想工作。领导干部不狠抓政治，下面的干部更不抓政治。去年以来，随着社会主义教育运动的深入开展，县委认识提高了，抓突出政治了，下边的干部也就跟着这样做了，全县工作就有起色。
    新乡县委第二书记王兴正和焦作市郊委书记王庆邦，分别以社会主义教育运动后忽视抓政治思想工作，和政治与生产轮流突出所造成的不良后果的事例说明：突出政治决不是可以一劳永逸的，如果认为经过一次社会主义教育运动，或集中力量抓一段政治思想工作，就什么问题都解决了，可以孤立地抓生产了，那就大错特错了。这不仅不能搞好生产，还有丧失前段政治工作成果、使资本主义歪风邪气泛滥的危险。
    参加会议的同志的共同看法是：突出不突出无产阶级政治，抓不抓阶级斗争，是革命不革命的问题，是关系革命成败的根本问题。每个革命干部、尤其领导干部，要不辜负党和人民的期望，就必须天天抓政治，时时抓政治，永远抓政治，并且抓紧、抓狠。
    用无产阶级政治的“尺子”，去量人、量思想、量生产
    参加会议的同志认为：我们干革命、特别是领导干部，头脑里必须装着无产阶级政治，看问题、处理问题都必须从无产阶级的政治方向——社会主义、共产主义方向上来考虑。如果就事论事，就生产论生产，认为“生产好”就是政治好，就会迷失政治方向，走到错路上去。看事物要有标准，量东西要有尺子。我们量人、量思想、量生产的“尺子”，就是无产阶级的政治、社会主义和共产主义这个“尺子”。
    博爱县委副书记张新文说：不用政治这把“尺子”去量人、量思想、量生产，而片面地用产量这把“尺子”去量人、量思想、量生产，就会把很多重大的政治问题掩盖起来，使人掌握不住正确的政治方向。
    如今年二月间搞评比时，就因为领导上没有用无产阶级政治的“尺子”去量人、量思想、量产量，把奖状、奖励物资发给了一个产量高，然而私心重、光想依赖国家支援、多打了粮食却不愿卖给国家的生产大队；另一个队干部和社员觉悟高，处处自力更生、艰苦奋斗，对国家贡献比上面那个大队多，就是因为产量低六斤，没有得奖。结果群众很有意见，说：“这是鼓励了人们只顾自己，不顾国家”。
    封丘县委书记郝玉门等同志谈到他们的体会时说，量人、量思想、量生产，用政治的“尺子”去量，越量人的无产阶级气越壮，为社会主义出头的人越多；不突出政治，单纯用产量的“尺子”去量，越量人的志越短、私心越重，为社会主义出头的人越少。汲县县委书记席光华从蹲点实践中得出这样的结论：政治不挂帅，群众的积极性就不会充分发挥；即使一时高起来，也不会持久，产量就不能持续上升，所谓生产好只是暂时的。
    突出政治，必须在改造世界观上狠下功夫
    参加会议的同志还谈到，能不能在各项工作中突出政治，关键在于领导，在于领导的思想革命化。而思想革命化的中心问题，就是活学活用毛主席著作，在改造世界观上狠下功夫。
    原阳县委书记樊仲生说：要摆正政治和生产的位置，突出政治，必须经常注意改造自己的思想，使自己的思想逐步无产阶级化，头脑里时时装着社会主义、共产主义。如果我们的思想还停留在民主革命阶段，以民主革命的思想来指导社会主义革命，就会对社会主义时期阶级斗争的形势认识不足，对复杂尖锐的阶级斗争熟视无睹。这样，当然也就不会自觉地去抓阶级斗争。
    封丘、获嘉的县委负责同志说，要突出政治，必须经常深入实际，深入群众，增强无产阶级感情。否则，阶级斗争观念就会模糊，政治嗅觉就会慢慢变得迟钝，就不能自觉地从政治上去做“人”的工作，充分发挥人的因素第一的作用。
    封丘县委书记郝玉门说，如果我们自己没有为革命种田的思想，怎能去教育农民为革命种田呢？如果自己有小农经济思想，怎能对农民进行集体主义、社会主义教育呢？所以，要突出政治，必须首先使领导思想革命化。只有领导思想革命化，才能带动广大干部思想革命化；而广大干部思想革命化了，就能以革命化的思想去教育广大农民群众。所谓思想革命化，最根本的是兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级的个人主义。
    到会的同志谈到，要真正树立起无产阶级世界观，必须彻底清除自己头脑里的资产阶级个人主义的私心杂念。“我”字当头，就会目光短浅，看不到革命的利益、人民的利益和共产主义光辉前景，就不能胸怀中国革命和世界革命，就会采取一些邪门歪道的办法去领导生产，从而把无产阶级政治丢到一边。
