    The Daring South Vietnamese People Once Again Shatter the Myth That the So-Called American Imperialist Offensive Cannot Be Smashed
    South Vietnamese Army and People Annihilate Over 50,000 Enemies in First Quarter Anti-"Sweep" Operations
    Killing or Wounding 25,000 American and Puppet Troops, Destroying or Damaging Nearly 900 American Aircraft
    Liberation Army Blows Up US Military Barracks in Saigon, Killing or Wounding Over 200 US Officers
    Editor's Note: The glorious victories of the South Vietnamese army and people in the first three months of this year are another paean to people's war.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "The myth that the reactionary offensive cannot be smashed should have no place in our ranks." The South Vietnamese army and people have once again thoroughly shattered the myth that the so-called American imperialist offensive cannot be smashed.
    In the past three months, as invading American troops dispatched tens of thousands of "elite troops" to launch a powerful "offensive," the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces not only thwarted several enemy "sweeps" but also eliminated more than 50,000 enemy troops, which is of great military and political significance. It has further diminished the arrogance of the American aggressors, greatly enhanced the confidence of the South Vietnamese army and people in victory, and provided successful experience for their continued smashing of larger-scale American military "offensives" and annihilation of more enemies in the future. Based on this victory, with more abundant experience, the South Vietnamese army and people will surely inflict heavier blows on the American aggressors.
    Hanoi, April 7 (Xinhua) -- According to the Vietnam News Agency, the South Vietnamese army and people, giving full play to the power of people's war, have achieved brilliant results in the first three months of this year. According to incomplete statistics, more than 50,000 enemy troops were killed or wounded, including nearly 25,000 American aggressor troops and puppet troops (including the complete annihilation of nine US military battalions and six puppet military battalions); approximately 890 American aircraft were shot down, damaged, or destroyed; and more than 400 various military vehicles were destroyed.
    The report said that in order to reverse the defeat and realize the so-called "dry season counter-offensive" plan, in the first three months of this year, the American aggressors dispatched tens of thousands of American troops, together with tens of thousands of puppet troops and accomplice troops, and launched large-scale, long-term "sweeps" in five directions towards the central coastal and Saigon-area liberated areas, attempting to eliminate the main forces of the Liberation Army, occupy the liberated areas, and seize the initiative on the battlefield. At the same time, they also carried out more than 40 "sweeps" in provinces from Quang Tri in the north to Rach Gia in the south, attempting to contain the Liberation Army in various regions. During the "sweeps," they implemented an extremely barbarous scorched-earth policy of "burn all, kill all, destroy all," indiscriminately spreading chemical poisons and even spraying poisonous gas into residents' shelters. However, the enemy's brutal methods not only failed to intimidate the South Vietnamese people but also aroused their even greater anger. The South Vietnamese army and people rose up to kill the enemy, further developing the people's war. With the spirit of determination to fight and win, they repelled the enemy's offensive on all battlefields.
    The report said that while conducting anti-"sweep" battles, the Liberation Army and guerrillas also continuously took the initiative to launch attacks on the enemy, taking advantage of the enemy's rear being empty after going out for "sweeps," fiercely attacking the enemy's rear bases, cutting off the enemy's transportation lines, forcing the enemy to abandon many strongholds and some military sub-districts, and annihilating large numbers of the enemy's active forces.
    The report said that the war situation in South Vietnam in the first three months of this year shows that not only the enemy troops who came out for "sweeps" were besieged and beaten, but also the enemy hiding in strongholds was subjected to fierce attacks. The more the enemy concentrates its forces to attack the liberated areas, the emptier its rear becomes. In the two months from January 24 to March 23 alone, the Liberation Armed Forces launched nine attacks on the enemy's seven airports, destroying 376 enemy aircraft and annihilating more than 1,800 American aggressor troops.
    The report said that the South Vietnamese Liberation Army becomes stronger as it fights more in continuous and long-term battles. The morale of the American aggressor troops and puppet troops is declining day by day. The South Vietnamese army and people shot down, damaged, or destroyed approximately 890 American aircraft in the first three months of this year, shattering the American imperialists' widely publicized so-called "air superiority."
    The report said that the South Vietnamese battlefield situation in the first three months of this year shows that the American aggressors' "dry season counter-offensive" plan has been惨 defeated. Although the American aggressors have sent hundreds of thousands of troops to South Vietnam, they still cannot change the situation, and the initiative on the battlefield is still firmly in the hands of the South Vietnamese army and people. The American aggressors have no safe place in South Vietnam, the "elite" troops of the American aggressor army have been severely damaged, and an important part of the strength of the American and puppet troops has been eliminated. The American aggressors cannot regain the initiative on the southern battlefield, but are increasingly trapped in a passive and beaten predicament.
    Hanoi, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Army" published an editorial on the 7th, pointing out that the brilliant victory achieved by the South Vietnamese army and people in the first three months of this year has shattered the American imperialists' dream of "seizing the initiative on the battlefield" during the dry season.
    The editorial said that in these three months, the American aggressors and their running dogs dispatched a total of more than one hundred battalions, used all cruel war methods, and launched dozens of large-scale "sweeps," but suffered heavy defeats. The "dry season counter-offensive plan" that they painstakingly planned at the Honolulu Conference has gone bankrupt.
    The editorial said that the great victories achieved by the South Vietnamese army and people in the past three months have dealt a heavy blow to the American and puppet groups, putting them in a more passive and embarrassing situation.
    The editorial pointed out that the South Vietnamese army and people have shown their leap-forward growth through the battles of the dry season, maintained the initiative on the battlefield, and become stronger as they fight, and will surely achieve greater victories in the future.
    The editorial said that no matter what war conspiracies and means the American imperialists adopt, they cannot save themselves from the quagmire. If American imperialism continues to expand the war of aggression in a mad way, it will inevitably suffer more慘 defeats.
    Hanoi, April 6 (Xinhua) -- According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency: The Saigon-Gia Dinh area of South Vietnam liberation armed forces, the early morning of April 1, in attacking and exploding the American officers' dormitory "Victoria Hotel" in Saigon, killed and wounded over two hundred American army, navy and air force officers.
    The Saigon-Gia Dinh area of South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces command announced a communiqué on April 3 on this glorious victory, it said that on April 1, at 4:30 AM, when the streets of Saigon were silent, a small detachment of the Saigon-Gia Dinh area Liberation Army, suddenly launched a fierce attack on the American officers' dormitory "Victoria Hotel" located on Tran Hung Dao Street in Saigon. The Liberation Army soldiers were very clever and brave, they killed the enemy in each of the guard towers outside the hotel with submachine guns at the start of the battle, occupied the hotel entrance, with heavy bombs carried out a violent explosion, severely damaging this ten-story building constructed of steel and cement, killing and wounding over two hundred American naval, army and air force officers.
    At the same time, the Liberation Army soldiers also attacked other enemy guard posts on Tran Hung Dao Street, intercepting the enemy reinforcements, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.
    This heroic Liberation Army unit after completing its mission successfully, under the cover of the people, has safely returned to the base.
    The communiqué pointed out that even though the American bandits had an extremely tight security on the "Victoria Hotel", they could not escape the punishment they deserve. This fact once again illustrates that even Saigon is absolutely not a safe place for the American bandits.
    The communiqué pointed out that the Liberation Armed Forces attack on the "Victoria Hotel" victory and the victory of the southern army and people in all battlefields warns the American aggressors: Even if it sends three or four hundred thousand troops to South Vietnam, no matter what scale of aggressive war it undertakes, it cannot escape a shameful defeat.
    The communiqué called on the Liberation Army and the urban armed self-defense forces to continue to bravely advance, accurately, fiercely, and continuously strike the American aggressors and their running dogs.

    敢于战斗的南越人民，又一次粉碎了所谓美帝进攻不能粉碎的神话
    南越军民第一季度反“扫荡”歼敌五万多
    毙伤美军和帮凶军两万五千，毁伤美机近九百架
    解放军爆炸西贡美军宿舍炸死炸伤美军官二百多
    编者按：越南南方军民今年头三个月的辉煌战绩，是又一曲人民战争的凯歌。
    毛泽东同志曾经说过：“所谓反动派进攻不能粉碎的神话，在我们队伍中不应有它的位置。”越南南方军民就又一次彻底粉碎了所谓美帝国主义进攻不能粉碎的神话。
    三个月来，在侵越美军出动数万“精锐部队”发动强大“攻势”的情况下，南越人民武装不仅挫败了敌人的几路“扫荡”，而且消灭了五万多名的敌军，这在军事上和政治上都具有重大意义。它进一步打掉了美国侵略者的锐气，大大增强了南越军民的胜利信心，为今后他们继续粉碎美军更大规模的“攻势”和歼灭更多的敌人，提供了成功的经验。在这个胜利的基础上，有了更丰富经验的南越军民，必将给予美国侵略者以更沉重的打击。
    新华社河内七日电　据越南通讯社报道，越南南方军民发挥人民战争的威力，在今年头三个月里取得了辉煌的战果。据不完全统计，共打死打伤敌军五万多名，包括美国侵略军和帮凶军近二万五千名，
  （其中全歼美军九个整营和伪军六个整营）；击落击伤和炸毁美国飞机约八百九十架；击毁各种军车四百多辆。
    报道说，美国侵略者为了扭转败局和实现所谓“旱季反攻”计划，在今年的头三个月中，出动了数万名美军，伙同成万名伪军和帮凶军，分五路向中部沿海和西贡附近解放区发动长时间的大规模“扫荡”，妄图消灭解放军的主力部队、占领解放区和夺取战场上的主动权。它们同时还在从北部的广治到南部的迪石各省进行了四十多次“扫荡”，妄图箝制各个地区的解放军。它们在“扫荡”中，实行极其野蛮的“烧光、杀光、毁光”的焦土政策，大规模地撒放化学毒药，甚至向居民的掩蔽洞喷射毒气。但是，敌人的残暴手段不仅没有吓倒越南南方人民，反而激起了他们更大的愤怒。南方军民奋起杀敌，使人民战争得到了进一步的发展。他们以决战决胜的精神，在各个战场上打退了敌人的进攻。
    报道说，解放军和游击队在进行反“扫荡”战斗的同时，还不断主动地向敌人发动进攻，趁敌人外出“扫荡”后方空虚的机会，猛烈袭击敌人的后方基地，切断敌人的交通运输线，迫使敌人放弃了许多据点和一些军事支区，歼灭了敌人的大批有生力量。
    报道说，越南南方今年头三个月的战况表明：不仅出来“扫荡”的敌军被围困和挨打，而且躲在据点里的敌人也遭到猛烈打击。敌人越是集中兵力进攻解放区，它们的后方就越空虚。仅在一月二十四日到三月二十三日的两个月中，解放武装力量就先后九次袭击敌人的七个机场，击毁敌机三百七十六架，歼灭美国侵略军一千八百多名。
    报道说，越南南方解放军在连续的长时间的战斗中越战越强。而美国侵略军和伪军的士气却日益低落。越南南方军民今年头三个月里击落、击伤和炸毁美国飞机约八百九十架，粉碎了美帝国主义大肆吹嘘的所谓“空中优势”。
    报道说，今年头三个月的南越战场局势表明，美国侵略者的“旱季反攻”计划已经遭到惨败。尽管美国侵略者向越南南方派出了几十万军队，但仍然改变不了局势，战场的主动权仍然牢牢地掌握在越南南方军民手里。美国侵略者在越南南方没有一个安全之所，美国侵略军的“精锐”部队已经遭到重创，美伪军的一部分重要力量已被消灭。美国侵略者不仅无法夺回南方战场上的主动权，反而日益陷入被动挨打的困境。
    新华社河内七日电　越南《人民军队报》七日发表社论指出，越南南方军民今年头三个月取得的辉煌胜利，使美帝国主义在旱季中“夺取战场主动权”的梦想遭到破灭。
    社论说，在这三个月中，美国侵略者及其走狗总共出动了一百多个营的兵力，使用了一切残酷的战争手段，发动了数十次大规模的“扫荡”，但是却遭到了惨重的失败。他们在檀香山会议上费尽心机策划的“旱季反攻计划”已经破产。
    社论说，南方军民三个月来所取得的巨大胜利给了美伪集团以沉重的打击，使他们陷于更加被动和狼狈的窘境。
    社论指出，越南南方军民经过旱季的战斗，显示了自己的飞跃的壮大，保持了战场上的主动权，越战越强，今后必将取得更大的胜利。
    社论说，不管美帝国主义采取什么战争阴谋和手段，都不能把它从泥潭中挽救出来。美帝国主义继续疯狂地在扩大侵略战争的道路上走下去，就必将遭到更惨重的失败。
    新华社河内六日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方西贡—嘉定地区解放武装力量四月一日凌晨在袭击和爆炸西贡美国军官宿舍“维多利亚饭店”的战斗中，共炸死炸伤美国陆海空军军官二百多人。
    越南南方西贡—嘉定地区解放武装力量指挥部四月三日就这一辉煌的胜利发表公报说，四月一日凌晨四时三十分，正当西贡市街头一片沉寂的时候，西贡—嘉定地区解放军的一支小部队，突然向位于西贡市区陈兴道大街的美国军官宿舍“维多利亚饭店”发起猛烈袭击。解放军战士们非常机智勇敢，他们在战斗一开始就用冲锋枪打死了饭店外面各个岗楼里的敌人，占领了饭店的入口，用重型炸弹进行猛烈的爆炸，严重炸坏这个钢筋水泥结构的十层大楼，炸死炸伤美国海、陆、空军军官二百多人。
    与此同时，解放军战士们还袭击了陈兴道大街上的其他敌军岗哨，截击敌人的援军，给敌人以重大杀伤。
    这支神勇的解放军部队在胜利完成任务后，在人民的掩护下，已安全返回根据地。
    公报指出，尽管美国强盗对“维多利亚饭店”的戒备极其严密，但是也逃避不了应得的惩罚。这个事实再一次说明，即使西贡市也绝对不是美国强盗的安全之所。
    公报指出，解放武装力量袭击“维多利亚饭店”的胜利和南方军民在各个战场上取得的胜利警告美国侵略者：即使它派遣三、四十万名军队到越南南方，也不管它进行什么规模的侵略战争，都逃脱不了可耻的失败。
    公报号召解放军和城市武装自卫力量继续奋勇前进，准确、猛烈和连续地打击美国侵略者和他们的走狗。
