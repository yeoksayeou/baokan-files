    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 5th – The Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party recently issued a statement, angrily condemning the Indonesian reactionaries' heinous decision to declare the Indonesian Communist Party and other progressive organizations illegal, and firmly supporting the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people's struggle against reactionary forces.
    The statement, issued on March 16th, said that the Albanian people are extremely indignant at the right-wing reactionary forces that seized power in Indonesia declaring the Indonesian Communist Party and some democratic mass organizations illegal. This is a serious fascist atrocity against the nation, serving the darkest reactionary forces of Indonesia and imperialism.
    The statement pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party is a great revolutionary party that has always been faithful to the lofty ideals of the Indonesian people. It is the banner of the Indonesian people's liberation struggle, the defender of Indonesia's freedom, independence, and progress, and a staunch fighter against imperialism, neo-colonialism, and old colonialism. It has won the sympathy and praise of all revolutionaries and progressive people in the world.
    The statement pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces declared the Indonesian Communist Party illegal in order to strike at the democratic and progressive forces in the country, to strike at the struggle of the broad masses of working people for democracy and social progress, and to obstruct Indonesia's development on the path of national independence and anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle.
    The statement said that for several months, the ugly crimes and brutal repression against the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people have turned Indonesia into a hell ruled by the most barbaric and bloody fascist terror. The dark reactionary forces of Indonesia have ruled the country, established a horrifying system of repression, and massacred tens of thousands of people by the most brutal means. The manipulators and instigators of the Indonesian reactionary forces are U.S. imperialism. U.S. imperialism attempts to drag Indonesia into its sphere of influence and turn Indonesia into an aggressive base against the national liberation movements of the Asian peoples. The Khrushchev modern revisionists, in order to prevent and weaken the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and domestic reactionaries, are also instigating and actively supporting the Indonesian reactionary forces against the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian progressive forces.
    The statement said that the Albanian Labor Party believes that no force in the world can subdue the Indonesian Communist Party and separate it from the Indonesian people. Relying on the masses of the people and its own revolutionary experience, holding high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, the Indonesian Communist Party will surely counter-attack counter-revolution with just revolutionary struggle, will surely smash the fascists' attack, and will lead the Indonesian people forward in the great people's revolution.
    The statement concluded by saying that the Indonesian people and the heroic Indonesian Communist Party are not isolated in their struggle against reactionaries and imperialism. They have received and will continue to receive the support of all truly revolutionary and progressive forces in the world.

    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, 5th – The Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" recently published an editorial, condemning the anti-communist and anti-people fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing generals clique.
    The editorial, published on March 25th, said: The Indonesian reactionaries have directed the spearhead of their attack first and foremost at the Indonesian Communist Party. "The Indonesian reactionaries' barbaric acts of terror and massacre against Indonesian Communists and the Indonesian people do not indicate their strength, but rather their weakness. The more the Indonesian right-wing forces suppress the Communists and the people, the more widespread and powerful their resistance and struggle will become, and the more rapid their defeat will be. This is an objective and inevitable process of history, from which no one can escape."
    The article emphasized that the Indonesian reactionaries' criminal plan is fully supported by U.S. imperialism and praised by the Khrushchev revisionists. What U.S. imperialism and the Khrushchev revisionists are interested in is making Indonesia leave the anti-imperialist camp, making Indonesia leave its true friends, and uniting with the enemy. Now, the American propaganda machine is openly suggesting that the Indonesian reactionaries destroy all existing democratic institutions in Indonesia, sever the good relations already established between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China, abandon opposition to "Malaysia," and accept American "aid." In fact, these are not mere hopes, but reflect the real conspiracy against the Indonesian people plotted by the United States and its lackeys. The article said that the activeness of the traitorous Khrushchev revisionists and the Tito clique is no less. Not long ago, an article in the Soviet "Pravda" slandered the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party as dogmatic and speculating around the "September 30th Movement."
    The article concluded by saying that there is no doubt that the Indonesian people will find sufficient strength within themselves to overcome all obstacles and new difficulties in defending and strengthening national independence, national security, and national progress, and in defeating counter-revolution on the road.

    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会发表声明
    谴责印度尼西亚反动派反共反人民暴行
    阿《人民之声报》说美帝和修正主义者要使印度尼西亚开倒车
    新华社地拉那五日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会最近发表声明，愤怒谴责印度尼西亚反动派宣布印度尼西亚共产党和其他进步组织非法的罪恶决定，坚决支持印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民反对反动势力的斗争。
    这个在三月十六日发表的声明说，阿尔巴尼亚人民对在印度尼西亚夺取了政权的右派反动势力宣布印度尼西亚共产党和一些民主群众组织为非法，感到极大的愤慨。这是反民族的严重法西斯暴行，它为印度尼西亚的和帝国主义的最黑暗的反动势力效劳。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚共产党是伟大的革命的党，它一贯忠实于印度尼西亚人民的崇高理想，它是印度尼西亚人民解放斗争的旗帜，印度尼西亚自由、独立和进步的捍卫者、反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义的坚定战士。它赢得了所有革命者和世界进步人士的同情和赞扬。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力宣布印度尼西亚共产党为非法，其目的是为了打击这个国家的民主进步力量，打击广大劳动群众为争取民主和社会进步的斗争，阻挠印度尼西亚在民族独立、反帝反殖的道路上发展。
    声明说，几个月来，反对印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民的丑恶罪行和野蛮镇压，已经把印度尼西亚变成了一个被最野蛮、最血腥的法西斯恐怖手段统治着的地狱。印度尼西亚的黑暗反动势力统治了国家，建立了骇人听闻的镇压制度，用最野蛮的手段屠杀了数以万计的人民。印度尼西亚反动势力的操纵者和唆使者是美帝国主义。美帝国主义企图把印度尼西亚拉进它的势力范围，并且把印度尼西亚变成反对亚洲各国人民民族解放运动的侵略基地。赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者为了阻止和削弱印度尼西亚人民对帝国主义、殖民主义和国内反动派的斗争，也在唆使和积极支持印度尼西亚反动势力反对印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚进步力量。
    声明说，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党相信，世界上没有任何力量能够压服印度尼西亚共产党并使它与印度尼西亚人民分开。印度尼西亚共产党依靠人民群众和自己的革命经验，高举马克思列宁主义旗帜，必将以正义的革命斗争反击反革命，必将粉碎法西斯分子的进攻，并在伟大的人民革命中领导印度尼西亚人民前进。
    声明最后说，在同反动派和帝国主义的斗争中印度尼西亚人民和英雄的印度尼西亚共产党不是孤立的，他们得到并将继续得到世界所有真正革命和进步力量的支持。
    新华社地拉那五日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》最近发表编辑部文章，谴责印度尼西亚右派将领集团反共、反人民的法西斯暴行。
    这篇三月二十五日发表的编辑部文章说：印度尼西亚反动派把打击的矛头首先指向印度尼西亚共产党。“印度尼西亚反动派对印度尼西亚共产党员和印度尼西亚人民的野蛮恐怖行为和屠杀，不是说明他们强大，而是说明他们软弱。印度尼西亚右派势力愈加镇压共产党人和人民，对他们的反抗和斗争也就愈加广泛和强大，他们的失败也就愈加迅速。这是历史的客观必然进程，是谁也逃避不了的。”
    文章强调指出，印度尼西亚反动派的罪恶计划得到美帝国主义的完全支持和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的赞扬。美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者所感兴趣的是使印度尼西亚离开反帝阵营，使印度尼西亚离开它的真正的朋友，并和敌人联合起来。现在，美国的宣传机器正公开建议印度尼西亚反动派摧毁印度尼西亚现存的所有民主机构，断绝印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国之间已经建立的良好关系，放弃反对“马来西亚”和接受美国的“援助”。事实上，这不是单纯的希望，而是反映了美国及其仆从策划的反对印度尼西亚人民的真实阴谋。文章说，叛徒赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、铁托集团的积极性也并不逊色。不久前，苏联《真理报》的一篇文章就诬蔑印度尼西亚共产党领导是教条主义和围绕着“九月三十日运动”进行投机。
    文章最后说，毫无疑问，印度尼西亚人民将在自己内部找到足够的力量，在捍卫和加强民族独立、国家安全和国家进步以及击溃反革命的道路上，克服一切障碍和新的困难。
