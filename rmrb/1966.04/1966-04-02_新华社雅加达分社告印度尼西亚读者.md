    Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch Statement to Indonesian Readers
    The Indonesian government's outrageous excuse for "closing" the Xinhua Branch cannot deceive anyone. The great friendship between the peoples of the two countries, tested by long-term anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles, will last forever.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 1st - Before leaving Jakarta and returning to China on April 1st after being unreasonably "temporarily closed" by the Indonesian government on March 25th, the Jakarta Branch of Xinhua News Agency issued a letter to Indonesian readers of the Xinhua News Agency news bulletin, Jakarta edition. The full text of the letter to readers is as follows: Dear Readers:
    The Indonesian government unreasonably announced the "temporary closure" of the Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch on March 25, 1966, and suspended all our reporting activities and the distribution of Xinhua News Agency news bulletins. As we must end our operations, we would like to say a few words to you, our readers, with feelings of reluctance.
    The Xinhua News Agency Jakarta Branch has been established for twelve years. During these years, with the surging anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles of the people of the world, the militant friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, forged in common struggle, has greatly developed. With the care and support of friends from all walks of life in Indonesia, the Xinhua Branch has done a lot of work, and we are deeply pleased and proud to be able to add a brick and a stone to the edifice of friendship between the two peoples. Recalling the beginning of the establishment of the Xinhua Branch, it vigorously reported on the 1955 Bandung Conference. Three excellent Xinhua reporters sacrificed their lives due to the sabotage of American and Chiang Kai-shek agents. In recent years, whether in the Indonesian people's struggle to recover West Irian and resist the neo-colonialist product "Malaysia," or in the activities of hosting the first Games of the New Emerging Forces, Xinhua News Agency has done its best to contribute its strength. We have widely disseminated to the world news of the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles, and also introduced to the Indonesian people the construction achievements of the Chinese people, the anti-imperialist struggles of the Chinese people and the people of the world, and their support for the Indonesian people through the Xinhua News Agency news bulletin. Indonesian friends from all walks of life often sent letters and visits, praised our work, and gave us a lot of encouragement and help. We would like to express our deep gratitude for this at the time of farewell.
    Since the drastic change in the Indonesian political situation in early October last year, we have been subjected to constant attacks and persecution by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, clamoring to "smash" the Xinhua Branch. On March 9 this year, they adopted fascist and barbaric methods, organized hundreds of thugs to attack the Xinhua Branch, injured three of our reporters and two staff members amidst the wild cries of "Smash the People's Republic of China" and "Kill all of you," set fire to the Xinhua Branch office, and smashed and robbed various utensils, creating an unprecedented act of violence in the history of international relations. Now, the Indonesian government has further brazenly announced the closure of the Xinhua Branch. This crude act of undermining the friendly relations between our two peoples completely violates the wishes of the Indonesian people and meets the needs of imperialism, especially American imperialism. We firmly believe that our dear readers will be able to make their own fair judgment on this.
    In the letter given to us by the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs when announcing the closure of the Xinhua Branch, it said that the Indonesian "masses" had shown "angry emotions" towards the Xinhua Branch, and therefore the Indonesian government found it necessary to "take security measures" for the Xinhua Branch in order to "further guarantee the personal safety of Xinhua reporters themselves." This excuse is extremely hypocritical and absurd. The so-called "anger" towards the Xinhua Branch was only expressed by a small handful of right-wing reactionaries in Indonesia, and certainly not by the broad masses of the Indonesian people. When right-wing forces organized thugs to destroy the Xinhua Branch and beat Xinhua reporters, the Indonesian government did not protect the safety of Chinese reporters as it should have. And now, the Indonesian government's so-called "further guarantee of the personal safety of Xinhua reporters" is to close the Xinhua Branch! How can there be such a way to "ensure safety"? Isn't it obvious that the Indonesian government's action is a serious step aimed at further deteriorating and undermining relations between the two countries?
    In the letter, the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also accused the Xinhua Branch of conducting "unfriendly propaganda," "in an inciting and divisive tone," and "having a tendency to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs," etc. These are all thorough slanders. Since October last year, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have launched a large-scale anti-communist, anti-China, and anti-people terror campaign, which is a universally known fact. Xinhua News Agency has only published objective reports on this. The existence of right-wing forces in Indonesia is an objective reality. President Sukarno has said that some groups want to turn the Indonesian revolution to the right.
    Why can Indonesians say this, and why can the whole world say this, but when Xinhua News Agency reports the facts truthfully, it is considered "an inciting and divisive tone" and "interference in internal affairs"?
    Facts speak louder than eloquence, let alone sophistry. It is futile for the Indonesian government to say that the closure of the Xinhua Branch is "to prevent further deterioration of the good relations between the Republic of Indonesia and the People's Republic of China." After the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have committed countless anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes, after the Xinhua Branch has been subjected to various slanders, persecutions and attacks, the Indonesian government is now openly closing the Xinhua Branch. Isn't this further deteriorating relations between the two countries? The Indonesian government's sophistry cannot deceive anyone.
    Dear Readers, we are very indignant and saddened by the sabotage of friendly relations between the two countries. However, we firmly believe that the great friendship between the Chinese and Indonesian peoples, tested in the long-term anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles, will last forever. We will always remember the deep friendship of the Indonesian people towards us.
    At this moment of parting, we would like to tell our dear readers that in the years to come, we will continue to contribute our strength to supporting the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonial revolutionary struggle, and wish the Indonesian people continuous victories in their revolutionary struggle. Dear Readers, the dark clouds will always dissipate, and when the bright sunshine appears, we will meet again!
    Wishing all readers good health!

    新华社雅加达分社告印度尼西亚读者
    印度尼西亚政府悍然“封闭”新华分社的荒谬借口欺骗不了任何人经过长期反帝反殖斗争考验的两国人民的伟大友谊万古长青
    新华社一日讯　被印度尼西亚政府在三月二十五日无理“暂时封闭”的新华社驻雅加达分社在四月一日撤离雅加达回国之前，向新华社新闻稿雅加达版的读者发表了一封告印度尼西亚读者书。告读者书全文如下：亲爱的读者们：
    印度尼西亚政府于一九六六年三月二十五日无理宣布“暂时封闭”新华社驻雅加达分社，停止我们的一切报道活动和发行新华社新闻稿。在我们不得不结束业务的时候，我们怀着惜别的心情向读者诸君说几句话。
    新华社雅加达分社成立已经十二年了。在这段岁月里，随着世界人民反帝反殖斗争的汹涌高涨，中国人民和印度尼西亚人民在共同斗争中建立起来的战斗友谊，曾经得到了很大的发展。新华分社在印度尼西亚各界友好人士的关怀和支持下做了许多工作，我们深以能在两国人民友谊的大厦上添加一砖一石而高兴和自豪。回忆新华分社建社伊始，就大力报道了一九五五年万隆会议，新华社三名优秀记者因美蒋特务的破坏而牺牲了生命。近几年来，无论在印度尼西亚人民收复西伊里安和对抗新殖民主义产物“马来西亚”的斗争中，或是举办第一届新兴力量运动会的活动中，新华社都尽力贡献了自己的力量。我们向全世界广泛传播了印度尼西亚人民反帝反殖斗争的消息，也通过新华社新闻稿向印度尼西亚人民介绍了中国人民的建设成就，介绍了中国人民和世界人民反帝斗争的情况和他们对印度尼西亚人民的支持。印度尼西亚各界朋友经常来信来访，对我们的工作加以赞扬，并且给我们很多鼓励和帮助。我们在告别的时候，谨对此表示深切的感谢。
    自从去年十月初印度尼西亚政局剧变以来，我们就受到印度尼西亚右派反动势力不断的攻击和迫害，叫嚷要“粉碎”新华分社。今年三月九日，他们采取了法西斯的野蛮手段，组织数百名暴徒袭击新华分社，在“粉碎中华人民共和国”，“全部杀死你们”的狂叫声中，打伤了我们三名记者和两名工作人员，纵火焚烧新华分社办公处所，捣毁和抢走各种用具，造成国际关系史上罕见的暴行事件。现在，印度尼西亚政府更进一步悍然宣布封闭新华分社。这种破坏我们两国人民友好关系的粗暴行为，完全违反了印度尼西亚人民的愿望，适应了帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的需要。我们深信亲爱的读者一定能够对此作出自己公正的判断。
    印度尼西亚政府外交部在宣布封闭新华分社时交给我们的信件中，说什么印度尼西亚“人民群众”对新华分社表现了“愤怒情绪”，因而印度尼西亚政府为了“进一步保障新华社记者本身的人身安全”，有必要对新华分社“采取安全措施”。这种借口是十分虚伪和极端荒谬的。所谓对新华分社表示“愤怒”的，只是印度尼西亚一小撮右派反动分子，而决不是印度尼西亚广大人民。当右派势力组织暴徒捣毁新华分社、殴打新华社记者时，印度尼西亚政府并未象它应当做的那样，保护中国记者的安全。而现在，印度尼西亚政府所谓“进一步保障新华社记者本身的人身安全”，就是封闭新华分社！天下那有这种“保障安全”的办法呢？印度尼西亚政府的这一行动，是旨在进一步恶化和破坏两国关系的严重步骤，难道还不明显吗？
    印度尼西亚外交部在来信中，还指责新华分社进行“不友好的宣传”，“带着煽动性和分裂性的语调”，“具有干涉印度尼西亚内政的倾向”等等，这些都是彻头彻尾的诽谤。从去年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力掀起了大规模的反共、反华、反人民的恐怖运动，这是举世皆知的事实。新华社对此只发表了客观的报道。印度尼西亚有右派势力，这是客观的存在。苏加诺总统就说过，有某些集团想把印度尼西亚革命引向右转。
    为什么印度尼西亚人可以这样说，全世界也可以这样说，唯独新华社如实进行报道，就是什么“带着煽动性和分裂性的语调”，是什么“干涉内政”呢？
    事实胜于雄辩，更不用说狡辩了。印度尼西亚政府把封闭新华分社说成是“为了防止印度尼西亚共和国和中华人民共和国良好关系的进一步恶化”，是徒劳的。在印度尼西亚右派反动势力犯下无数的反华、排华罪行之后，在新华分社受到种种诽谤、迫害和袭击之后，印度尼西亚政府现在又公然封闭新华分社，这不是进一步恶化两国关系又是什么呢？印度尼西亚政府的狡辩，是欺骗不了任何人的。
    亲爱的读者们，我们对于两国友好关系横遭破坏感到十分愤慨和痛心。但是，我们坚信，在长期反帝反殖斗争中考验过的中国同印度尼西亚两国人民的伟大友谊，是万古长青的。印度尼西亚人民对我们的深情厚谊，我们永远铭记在心。
    在这分别的时刻，我们愿意告诉亲爱的读者，在今后的岁月里，我们将为支持印度尼西亚人民的反帝反殖革命斗争继续贡献自己的力量，并且祝愿印度尼西亚人民在革命斗争中不断取得胜利。亲爱的读者，乌云总是要消散的，当灿烂的阳光出现的时候，我们将再度见面！
    祝读者诸君健康！
    新华社驻雅加达分社
        一九六六年四月一日
