    Xinhua News Agency, April 14th, Taipei Dispatch: While right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia are colluding with local Chiang Gang secret agent elements to conduct anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, the Chiang Kai-shek Gang entrenched in Taiwan is openly shouting support for the Indonesian right-wing authorities' persecution of Overseas Chinese and preparing to continue sending secret agents into the country.
    According to reports from the Chiang Gang's "Central News Agency," Ma Shuli, the "Director of the Third Group of the Central Committee" of the Chiang Party, clamored in Taipei on the 10th that the Indonesian right-wing generals' group ordering the seizure of Overseas Chinese organizations' meeting places, closure of Overseas Chinese schools, and destruction of Overseas Chinese shops in Jakarta and other areas was a "strong anti-communist action." He incited the reactionaries of some countries to provide "broad support" to the anti-China, anti-Chinese, and persecution of Overseas Chinese activities of the Indonesian right-wing authorities. This national traitor who fled to Taiwan referred to the serious incident of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces organizing mobs to frantically attack the Chinese Consulate in Medan as "a praiseworthy thing."
    He also revealed that when the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces organized mobs to attack and persecute Overseas Chinese, the Chiang Gang secret agent elements remaining in the area "were not harmed." He hoped that the Indonesian right-wing generals' group could "maintain contact" with the local Chiang Gang secret agent elements in future anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. He also demanded that the Indonesian right-wing authorities and the Chiang Gang cooperate to allow the Chiang Kai-shek bandit secret agents who had been expelled from Indonesia by the Indonesian people eight years ago to "return to Indonesia as soon as possible" to assist the right-wing reactionary forces in "stabilizing local social" order. According to reports, before this, in order to cooperate with the local right-wing reactionary forces in their anti-China activities, the Chiang Kai-shek Gang secret agent elements in Indonesia had coerced a group of Indonesian Chinese students and youths to participate in the so-called "Chinese Loyalty Conference" presided over by Chiang Gang secret agent elements and "Three People's Principles Youth League" core members. On April 2nd, Chiang Kai-shek Gang secret agent elements again forced these students and youths to stage provocative demonstrations at the Chinese Consulate in Medan.

    印尼反动势力勾结蒋帮特务反华排华
    蒋匪帮公然叫嚷支持印尼右派迫害华侨
    新华社十四日讯　台北消息：在印度尼西亚右派反动势力勾结当地蒋帮特务分子进行反华、排华活动的时候，盘踞台湾的蒋匪帮公然叫嚷支持印度尼西亚右派当局迫害华侨，并准备继续派特务分子进入这个国家。
    据蒋帮“中央社”报道，蒋党“中央第三组主任”马树礼十日在台北叫喊，印度尼西亚右派将领集团下令在雅加达和其它地区强占华侨团体的会所，封闭华侨学校，捣毁华侨商店，是“坚强（的）反共行动”。他煽动一些国家的反动派，对印度尼西亚右派当局的反华、排华和迫害华侨的活动，“予以广大的支援”。这个逃往台湾的民族败类，对印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织暴徒疯狂袭击中国驻棉兰领事馆的严重事件，称作是“一件值得赞扬的事”。
    他还透露，在印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织暴徒袭击和迫害华侨时，留在当地的蒋帮特务分子，“均未受害”。他希望印度尼西亚右派将领集团今后在进行反华、排华活动中，还能和当地的蒋帮特务分子“切取联系”。并要求印度尼西亚右派当局和蒋帮合作，允许早在八年前就被印度尼西亚人民驱逐出境的蒋匪特务分子“早日重回印尼”，协助右派反动势力“安定当地社会”秩序。据报道，在这之前，在印度尼西亚的蒋匪帮特务分子，为配合当地右派反动势力反华，曾经胁迫一批印度尼西亚籍华裔学生和青年，参加了蒋帮特务分子和“三青团”骨干分子主持的所谓“华裔效忠大会”。四月二日，蒋匪帮特务分子又强迫这些学生和青年到中国驻棉兰领事馆进行挑衅性示威。
