    Only the Party is the Savior of the People
    Worker of Shenyang Water Pump Factory He Enpu

    Comrade Wu Han describes Hai Rui as the “savior of the people who were suppressed, bullied, and wronged at that time.” The purpose of this shameless nonsense is to beautify and praise the reactionary nature of the landlords, bureaucrats, and bourgeoisie who seek every possible advantage and exploit the people to the bone. I say that Comrade Wu Han is telling a blatant lie and blatantly distorting history. Hai Rui was a loyal subject and filial son of the feudal class, he could only serve the reactionary ruling class, and would never seek happiness for the people.

    I was born into a family of tenant farmers. My grandfather and father both did heavy labor for landlords. In 1941, my grandfather and father worked for the landlord Tang Zhenhai in our old home in Inner Mongolia, borrowing grain from the landlord; borrowing two *shi* in the spring and having to repay three *shi* in the autumn. When the landlord saw that my family could not repay the grain in the autumn, he forcibly took away the pig that my mother had painstakingly raised for a year. We really couldn't survive. My grandfather led our whole family to leave our hometown and go to another place to work for a landlord named Yuan. One day, my grandfather and an old man named Liu were cutting grass for the cattle in the wild when they encountered two policemen on horseback with guns. These two policemen unreasonably ordered my grandfather to kneel down and shot him and Uncle Liu several times, killing them both. Then they knocked down a person on the river embankment and rode away.

    In the old society, there was nowhere to seek justice for grievances, and no one to listen to reason. It was truly "the yamen gates face south, those with money enter to argue their case, those without money stay away." There was no place to speak for the poor, no one to speak for the poor. My grandfather was unreasonably killed by the police, and my father had nowhere to go to reason, to file a lawsuit. There were places for people to sit in the court, but no place for us to stand. At that time, not only could you not sue, but you couldn't even make a sound. If those two policemen found out, they would have to cut you off at the roots! In the old society, no farmer had a good end if they filed a lawsuit. In our village, the old Yang family had several members killed by bandits, their belongings were robbed, and their daughter was defiled. However, the local landlord Gao Laorong, because he colluded with the bandits, said that the old Yang family had stolen the bandits' guns and forced the old Yang family to hand over the guns. The old Yang family went to the county and to the province to file a lawsuit, and after suing back and forth, they were punished and imprisoned for a year. After being released from prison, the whole family fled to other places to escape famine. The old society was a society where officials protected each other. Where were the "honest officials" who spoke for the common people?

    In 1951, the vigorous movement to suppress counter-revolutionaries began. My father returned to his hometown and went to the county public security bureau. The director cordially held my father's hand and said, "Your father is my father. The People's Government will definitely avenge you." A few days later, the People's Government arrested the counter-revolutionary who killed my grandfather and soon executed him according to law.

    Without our beloved Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, I would still have nowhere to seek justice. Wu Han praised "Hai Rui" and wanted us to regard the high-ranking bureaucrats who served the landlord class as "saviors." What a wishful thinking! Wu Han, I only know that the great Party and the beloved leader Chairman Mao are truly the saviors of our oppressed, bullied, wronged, and exploited people. Do you want us to forget the suffering of the past? Do you want us young people to take over the bourgeoisie's class? Wu Han, you are daydreaming! We young people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can distinguish right from wrong and know who our friends are and who our enemies are. We will never be fooled by you.

    只有党才是人民的救星	沈阳水泵厂工人　何恩普
    吴晗同志把海瑞说成是“当时被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星。”这种无耻谰言的目的，是把大地主大官僚资产阶级对人民寸利必得、敲骨吸髓的反动本质加以美化和赞扬。我说吴晗同志是在撒弥天大谎，明目张胆地歪曲历史。海瑞是封建阶级的忠臣孝子，他只能替反动统治阶级卖命，而决不会为人民谋幸福。
    我出身在雇农的家庭里，祖父、父亲都给地主扛大活。一九四一年，祖父和父亲在内蒙古老家给地主唐镇海扛活，借了地主的粮，春天借二石，秋后得还三石。秋后地主一看我家还不起粮，就硬把母亲辛辛苦苦喂了一年的猪抢去了。我们实在活不下去了，祖父带领我们全家背井离乡到另外一个地方给一家姓袁的地主扛活。一天，祖父和一个姓刘的老大爷在野外给牛割草，碰到了两个持枪骑马的警察，这两个警察无缘无故叫爷爷跪下，一连几枪把爷爷和刘大爷都打死了。然后又把河坝上的一个人打倒，就扬长而去。
    在旧社会有冤没处诉，有理没处讲。正是“衙门口朝南开，有理没钱莫进来”。哪有替穷人说话的地方，哪有替穷人讲话的人。爷爷被警察无缘无故打死，父亲也没有地方去说理，去告状。到法院有人家坐着的地方，没有咱站着的地方，那时不但不能告，甚至都不能声张，要是叫那两个警察知道了，还不得给你来个斩草除根哪！在旧社会，哪个农民告状有好下场。咱村老杨家，被土匪打死好几口人，东西被抢了，女儿被糟踏了，可是本村大地主高老荣因跟土匪有勾搭，说老杨家偷了土匪的枪，硬逼着老杨家把枪交出来。老杨家到县里、到省里去告状，告来告去，自己受了刑，还坐了一年牢。出狱后全家就到外地逃荒去了。旧社会就是官官相护，哪有什么替老百姓说话的“清官”？
    一九五一年，轰轰烈烈的镇压反革命运动开始，我父亲回到老家，到了县公安局，局长亲切地拉住父亲的手说：“你的父亲就是我的父亲。人民政府一定要为你报仇雪恨。”没过几天，人民政府就逮捕了杀害我祖父的反革命分子，不久就依法把他枪决了。
    没有我们敬爱的党和伟大的领袖毛主席，到现在我也无处伸冤。吴晗捧出了“海青天”来，想让我们把为大地主阶级服务的大官僚当做“救星”，真是妄想！吴晗，我就知道伟大的党和敬爱的领袖毛主席才真正是我们被压迫、被欺侮、被冤屈、被剥削人民的救星。你想让我们忘记过去的苦吗？想叫我们青年接资产阶级的班吗？吴晗，你这是白日做梦！我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的青年，能辨别是非，知道谁是我们的朋友，谁是我们的敌人。我们决不上你的当。
