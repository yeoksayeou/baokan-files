    US Imperialism Runs Into Walls Everywhere
    An article in the "Tomorrow's Outlook" section of the March 28th issue of *U.S. News & World Report* magazine anxiously discussed the embarrassing situation of the United States running into walls everywhere in the world, reflecting the flustered state of the American ruling clique. An excerpt of the article is translated and annotated below:
    People are increasingly feeling that the United States is doing too much in the world. The United States now finds that it is condemned wherever something happens. American youth even have to endure the casualties that come with the mission of being an international policeman. (US imperialism wants to promote a counter-revolutionary global strategy of seeking world hegemony and engages in intervention and aggression everywhere, so it is natural to be opposed and condemned everywhere. This is the so-called lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet.)
    As things stand, not many people are sharing this burden.
    In South Vietnam, power struggles among generals complicate America's problems even further. The desertion rate in the South Vietnamese army remains high. Politically, it is simply a mess.
    Therefore, the United States is bound to shoulder this costly and increasingly heavy burden. (Sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire.)
    South Korea has made significant contributions. Australia, which is directly involved, will also increase its assistance. However, some major powers with vested interests prefer to stand aside.
    France is, in fact, doing everything it can to trip up the United States. (In fact, France wants to break free from the shackles of the United States.)
    Asia is just the most obvious trouble area that the United States is trapped in. Wherever you look, the situation is the same. (Indeed, anti-American storms are rising everywhere.)
    In Latin America, people blame most of the troubles on American policies. Billions of dollars in American aid seem to be unappreciated and instead attract a lot of criticism. (This is precisely because people are increasingly seeing that American "aid" is nothing more than an instrument of American aggression.)
    The small Dominican Republic, despite American aid and troops, remains in chaos.
    In Western Europe, de Gaulle of France wants the United States to get out.
    Some new countries in Black Africa, despite receiving large-scale aid, are still in chaos. (Facts prove that the more "aid" the United States invests, the more chaotic it becomes.)
    The affairs of the world are so chaotic, and the United States is so deeply involved in those affairs, that Secretary of State Rusk privately said that Vietnam is important, but it only takes up less than one-sixth of his time and attention. (If that's really the case, it doesn't mean that the predicament of the United States in South Vietnam doesn't cause people like Rusk a headache, but it only shows that the US president and secretary of state have too many things to worry about.) This is true, even though the United States has spent 825 billion dollars on defense and aid to other countries since World War II, trying to gain some stability.
    The idea is beginning to emerge that perhaps something is fundamentally wrong. (Of course, US imperialism's plan to dominate the world is completely wrong.)

### 美帝到处碰壁

    美帝到处碰壁
    三月二十八日出版的一期《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志，在《明天展望》一栏中忧心忡忡地谈论美国目前在全世界到处碰壁的窘况，反映出了美国统治集团焦头烂额的狼狈处境。现将该文摘译并加批语发表如下：
    人们越来越感到，美国在世界上干的事情太多了。美国现在发现，只要什么地方出事，它就受到谴责。美国青年甚至必须承受随着执行国际警察的使命所带来的伤亡。（美帝国主义要推行独霸世界的反革命全球战略，到处进行干涉和侵略，就自然要到处遭到反对和谴责，这就是所谓搬起石头砸了自己脚。）
    从目前的情况来看，没有多少人分挑这个担子。
    在南越，将领们的争权夺利使美国的问题更为复杂化。在南越军队中，开小差的比率仍然很高。政治上简直是一团糟。
    因此，美国势必要挑起这副代价高昂的越来越重的担子。（在泥潭中越陷越深。）
    南朝鲜作出了重大的帮助。有直接关系的澳大利亚，也要增加它的帮助。但是，一些有利害关系的大国都宁愿站在一旁。
    法国事实上正在尽其所能绊美国的脚。（事实上，法国是要摆脱美国的羁绊。）
    亚洲不过只是美国陷进去的一个最明显的麻烦地区。不管你往哪里瞧，到处都是同样情况。（的确是反美风暴到处兴起。）
    在拉丁美洲，人们把大多数麻烦都归罪于美国的政策。数以十亿美元计的美国援助看来并没有被人家领情，反而招来大量批评。（这正是因为人们越来越看清，美“援”不过是美国的一种侵略工具。）
    小小的多米尼加共和国，尽管美国给了援助和派了军队，局势仍然是一片混乱。
    在西欧，法国的戴高乐要美国滚蛋。
    黑非洲的一些新国家，尽管得到大规模援助，仍然处在混乱之中。（事实证明，哪里美国投入的“援助”越多，哪里就越混乱。）
    世界的事物如此纷乱，而美国又在那些事情中陷得如此之深，以至国务卿腊斯克私下说，越南固然重要，却只占去他不到六分之一的时间和注意力。（如果真是这样的话，也并不是说美国在南越的困境不叫腊斯克之流伤透脑筋，而只是说明美国总统、国务卿要伤脑筋的事情太多罢了。）这是真实的，尽管美国自从第二次世界大战以来，在防务和对其他国家援助上已花了八千二百五十亿美元，试图获得某种稳定。
    开始有了一种想法，也许是有什么根本上错了。（当然，美帝国主义想要独霸世界的算盘是完全打错了。）
