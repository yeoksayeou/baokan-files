    Editor's Note: Political work is the lifeline of all economic work. The record of the symposium of representatives from some handicraft units published today once again proves this with vivid facts.

    Most handicraft factories and cooperatives are collectively owned. Most of the members of these enterprises were originally small producers and other petty bourgeoisie from urban and rural areas. Therefore, in handicraft enterprises, it is even more necessary to emphasize politics, grasp class struggle, grasp the struggle between the two roads, and constantly overcome capitalist tendencies to ensure the healthy development of handicraft production in the socialist direction.

    In recent years, these five handicraft production units have experienced great changes in production, and these changes are intertwined with the struggle between the two roads. As soon as the Party's leadership is weakened and political work is relaxed, capitalist tendencies will grow, and the enterprise will decline. When the Party's leadership is strengthened and politics takes command, the enterprise can advance by leaps and bounds along the socialist road.

    The vast number of handicraft workers in our country love socialism. They have a high degree of enthusiasm for taking the socialist road. As long as we emphasize politics, arm their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and enlighten their class consciousness, so that they truly understand the principle of working for socialism, they will, with the greatest enthusiasm, tap into the endless potential of production and make contributions to the cause of socialism. The rapid advances in production of these five handicraft factories and cooperatives are derived from the rapid advances in the thinking of the workers.

    Recently, some representatives of handicraft units under the Second Ministry of Light Industry who were in Beijing for meetings, at the invitation of this newspaper, discussed the issue of how handicraft enterprises should emphasize politics and correctly handle the relationship between politics and professional work. Everyone agreed that a handicraft factory or cooperative, in order to develop production in the socialist direction, must run the enterprise according to Mao Zedong Thought, emphasize politics at all times, and not leave politics for a single day.

    Emphasize politics, production prospers; deviate from politics, production declines.

    Liu Jiayuan, Secretary of the Party Branch and Director of the LianNong Pot Factory in Ma'anshan City, Anhui Province, said that their factory has experienced a process of growth - regression - and then advancement since its establishment in 1961, which is a process of emphasizing politics - deviating from politics - and then emphasizing politics again. When the factory was first established, the material and technical conditions were very difficult. None of the eighty-odd people knew how to cast pots. Because they emphasized politics, carried forward the revolutionary spirit, worked hard, and learned modestly, the iron pots produced had the lowest cost and good quality among the dozen or so factories in the province. However, in the second half of 1963, the quality of the iron pots dropped sharply, and the yield of finished products was less than 50%. At that time, the factory had a backlog of 110,000 iron pots, and it was almost to the point of not having money to pay wages or buy raw materials.

    Why did this regression occur? The main reason was that the leading cadres of the factory developed complacency, thinking that "the pot factory is a new venture, and it's already good to be able to do this." The cadres no longer went deep into the workshop to participate in labor, "afraid of being tired, afraid of being dirty, and afraid of iron water burning their clothes." In this way, how can the leading cadres take the lead in mobilizing the masses to do a good job in production if they don't emphasize politics in their thinking?

    Later, with the help of the Municipal Party Committee, they criticized the complacent ideas, and together with the workers, they studied articles such as "Serve the People" and "Get Organized!," and understood that the fundamental reason for the decline in production was the failure to emphasize politics and use Mao Zedong Thought to take command. They re-energized their revolutionary spirit, took Daqing as an example, insisted on going to the workshop to participate in labor, and worked with the workers to study and solve the problem of pot quality. The factory's backward situation quickly changed, the variety of products increased, costs decreased, and quality continued to improve. In 1964 and 1965, the iron pots produced were rated first three times in five provincial iron pot quality assessments, and were rated first in national quality at the end of 1965.

    It is necessary to fight against the capitalist tendencies of small producers.

    Everyone also talked about the fact that the struggle between the two roads, capitalism and socialism, is very sharp in handicraft enterprises, and the prominent manifestation is the struggle between "money takes command" and politics takes command. Therefore, in handicraft departments, emphasizing politics must be combined with the struggle against the capitalist tendencies of small producers.

    Gu Dequan, Director of the Guce Farm Implement Repair Factory in Fangshan County, Beijing, said that in the past, some leading cadres in their factory were focused on output value and profits. In order to make more money, they sent people to large factories in Beijing to take on some high-profit jobs, and were unwilling to produce small farm implements with low profits. In order to encourage workers to work more and earn more money, they also implemented a reward and punishment system, rewarding for exceeding quotas and punishing for losses. As a result, everyone rushed to do products with high profits, high output value, and easy work. No matter how much the farmers needed products with low profits, low output value, and difficult work, no one was willing to do them. This erroneous practice of "money takes command" not only affected support for agriculture, but also caused serious consequences of employees greedily seeking more and faster work, regardless of product quality. In 1964 alone, the factory lost more than 15,000 yuan due to unqualified products.

    Later, following the instructions of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee, the factory Party branch organized employees to study Chairman Mao's work "Serve the People," and then organized employees to launch a debate on "serving whom." The workers sharply criticized: "Chairman Mao taught us to serve the people wholeheartedly, but the factory leaders encouraged us to serve 'RMB.' Where do you want to take us?" The leading cadres accepted the criticism, made a self-criticism at the mass meeting, abolished the "money takes command" system, and implemented a system in which cadres participated in labor for half a day. A new atmosphere of facing the countryside and serving the farmers wholeheartedly emerged throughout the factory.

    Without "money takes command," but with politics takes command, can the enthusiasm of the workers be mobilized? Some people initially doubted it, but the facts quickly dispelled their doubts. The employees were full of energy and used their own hands to manufacture dozens of machines and equipment, transforming the original "blacksmith shop" into a mechanized and semi-mechanized farm implement repair factory. In the past, when "money took command," it was stipulated that one person could make eight large hoe hooks a day, but the quota was still not met. Now, it has reached eleven. Last year, the employees designed and manufactured more than forty kinds of improved farm implements loved by the farmers, and also went to the mountainous and plain areas to repair a large number of agricultural machinery for the production teams, regardless of the hard work. The factory vigorously supported agriculture, was welcomed by the farmers, and its own production was also developed.

    Emphasizing politics can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.

    To do a good job in handicraft production, it is necessary to mobilize the enthusiasm of all workers. What method should be used to mobilize the enthusiasm of handicraft workers? Deng Xinwu, Secretary of the Party Branch of Xiangzhong Pot Factory in Yiyang City, Hunan Province, said: Emphasizing politics can fully mobilize the enthusiasm of handicraft workers to build socialism; engaging in material incentives will corrupt the thinking of workers and cause losses to production. Their factory once used a high piece-rate wage system to mobilize the enthusiasm of workers. Some workers received monthly wages that greatly exceeded the income of local farmers and also exceeded the wage levels of workers in other industries. As a result, the idea of "working to earn money," which already existed among handicraft workers, quickly developed. In order to earn more money, some workers disregarded quality and simply pursued quantity. The iron pots produced by the factory were of poor quality and high price, thick and heavy, and the farmers were unwilling to buy them.

    After the socialist education movement, the factory leading cadres improved their understanding and grasped political and ideological work. They organized workers to go to the countryside to listen to the opinions of farmers. The workers learned that the lake area lacked firewood, and if the pots were thick, they would burn more firewood. They also calculated that if each pot weighed one or two, hundreds of thousands of pots a year would waste tens of thousands of pounds of pig iron for the state. After the workers returned to the factory, they worked hard to improve the quality of the pots, making them thin and durable. The factory also organized workers to study Chairman Mao's works, so that they realized that casting iron pots was doing revolution and serving the people. Later, according to the requirements of the workers, the factory reformed the unreasonable bonus system.

    With politics in command, the enthusiasm of the workers was truly mobilized, and the face of production changed rapidly. Last year, the quality of the factory's iron pots was rated second in the country, and the output increased by 56% compared with 1957, the year with the best production. The number of factory personnel decreased by a quarter, and labor productivity increased by 45%.

    We must establish the idea of serving the 500 million peasants wholeheartedly.

    Several comrades from handicraft factories and cooperatives pointed out that supporting agriculture is the primary task of handicrafts, and emphasizing politics in handicraft enterprises is to serve the 500 million peasants wholeheartedly.

    Pan Ruyan, Secretary of the Party Branch of the Taijiang Wooden Bucket Cooperative in Fuzhou City, said: In the past, the wooden buckets we produced were of low quality and high prices, and the farmers had a lot of complaints. They said: "A load of buckets costs more than four yuan and ninety cents, which is too expensive. We have to sell five loads of vegetables to exchange for one load of buckets." At first, we did not pay attention to the farmers' opinions. Because the leading cadres at the time did not establish the idea of serving the peasants and had a purely profit-making viewpoint, thinking that as long as the enterprise made more money and the workers earned more income, the cooperative would be well run. Some comrades also said that the cost of wooden buckets could only be reduced if the state reduced the price of wood.

    Last year, we launched a study activity of Chairman Mao's works, and all employees of the factory realized that supporting agriculture is the primary task of handicrafts, and at the same time, the enterprise can only continue to grow and develop in supporting agriculture. Then, we launched a mass technical innovation and technical revolution activity, using self-reliance to engage in mechanization to reduce production costs.

    In the past, some people believed that no one in our factory could design and draw blueprints, there was no machinery and equipment, there was a lack of funds, and there was a lack of materials, so we could not engage in technical innovation. After emphasizing politics, everyone was encouraged and their minds became more flexible. We adopted the "five self" measures (design and drawing blueprints ourselves, drawing professional personnel ourselves, innovating equipment ourselves, raising funds ourselves without funds, and finding materials ourselves without materials), and last year alone, we made more than 20 sets of special equipment, basically realizing the "one-stop shop for wooden bucket production." The utilization rate of wood has been significantly improved. In the past, one cubic meter of wood could only produce 20 loads of buckets, but now it can produce more than 30 loads. At the same time, production efficiency has been greatly improved. The cost of wooden buckets has been significantly reduced, and the price per load of buckets has dropped from more than four yuan and ninety cents in the past to more than two yuan and ninety cents, which the farmers are very satisfied with. This matter shows that emphasizing politics and establishing the idea of serving the peasants wholeheartedly can better stimulate the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance of employees and achieve the goal of better supporting agriculture.

    Handicraft leading departments must first adhere to the correct direction.

    What are some of the problems in the emphasis on politics in handicraft leading departments? He Ziqiao, Deputy Director of the Handicraft Bureau of Jinzhou City, Liaoning Province, said: To lead the production of handicraft factories and cooperatives well, we must first grasp politics, use politics to command professional work, and make handicraft production adhere to the correct direction. Conversely, if we only grasp money and equipment, not politics, and see things but not people, the production of handicraft factories and cooperatives will go astray, causing losses to the state and the collective.

    He cited the example of the Jinzhou Scissors Production Cooperative. From 1960 to 1963, the operating conditions of this cooperative had not been good, and it had lost more than 400,000 yuan. In the past, they only looked for reasons from the business perspective, thinking that the handicraft cooperative's equipment was poor and its technology was poor, so they allocated 80,000 yuan to them and sent people to Hangzhou Zhang Xiaoquan, Beijing Wang Mazi and other "scissors kings" to buy equipment and learn technology. Unexpectedly, the machines were bought and the technology was learned, but production still did not improve, and the situation of losses had not changed. At this time, the leading cadres of the Bureau went to this cooperative to stay and investigate, and found that the fundamental reason why the cooperative's production was not good was not the lack of material conditions, but the fact that politics was not in command; most workers were not clear about the question of "working for whom," thinking that "working is just for earning money to eat"; a few old workers with higher awareness who wanted to run the cooperative well were very isolated and even suffered blows. Many situations showed that the struggle between the two roads in this cooperative was very sharp, which was the reason for the long-term losses in production.

    The leading comrades of the Handicraft Bureau then realized that to lead this cooperative well, they could not rely on giving money and equipment, but must first give them politics. Therefore, they led the cooperative to carry out class education by recalling the past bitterness and thinking about the present sweetness, studying Chairman Mao's works extensively, and also conducted a discussion on "working for whom." The workers improved their class consciousness, and many people examined their erroneous ideas of wanting to leave the cooperative and go it alone. The old workers who had been isolated in the past became advanced models for everyone to learn from.

    With the correct direction, technical innovation throughout the cooperative was carried out very enthusiastically, technical problems were solved one by one, and the face of production quickly changed. Now, due to the improved quality of this cooperative's products, it has changed from a situation of backlog in the past to a situation of supply exceeding demand. The production cost of scissors has also dropped from more than eight jiao per pair in the past to more than four jiao per pair, and the enterprise has changed from loss to profit.

### 突出政治才能保证手工业健康发展——部分手工业单位的同志座谈如何正确处理政治和业务的关系

    突出政治才能保证手工业健康发展
    ——部分手工业单位的同志座谈如何正确处理政治和业务的关系
    编者按：政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线，今天发表的部分手工业单位代表的座谈记录，又一次用生动的事实证明了这一点。
    手工业厂社大部分是集体所有制，企业的成员，大多数原来是小生产者和城乡其它小资产阶级。因此，在手工业企业里，就更加需要突出政治，抓阶级斗争，抓两条道路的斗争，不断地克服资本主义倾向，保证手工业生产按照社会主义的方向健康地发展。
    近年来，这五个手工业生产单位，生产上都经历了很大的变化，在这些变化里，都交织着两条道路的斗争。只要党的领导一削弱，政治工作一放松，资本主义倾向就滋长起来，企业就走下坡路；当党的领导加强了，政治挂帅了，企业就能够沿着社会主义的道路大踏步前进。
    我国广大手工业工人是热爱社会主义的。他们对走社会主义道路有很高的积极性。只要突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装他们的头脑，启发他们的阶级觉悟，使他们真正懂得为社会主义而劳动的道理，他们就会以最大的热情，挖掘出无穷无尽的生产潜力，为社会主义事业作出贡献。这五个手工业厂社生产上的突飞猛进，就是从工人们思想上的突飞猛进中产生出来的。
    最近，一些在北京开会的第二轻工业部手工业单位的代表，应本报邀请，座谈了手工业企业如何突出政治、正确处理政治和业务关系的问题。大家都认为，一个手工业厂社，要按照社会主义的方向发展生产，就必须按照毛泽东思想办企业，时时突出政治，一天也不能离开政治。
    突出政治，生产兴旺；脱离政治，生产下降
    安徽马鞍山市联农锅厂党支部书记兼厂长柳家源说，他们厂从一九六一年建厂起，经历了一个成长——倒退——又前进的过程，也就是一个突出政治——脱离政治——又突出政治的过程。刚建厂的时候，物质技术条件很困难，八十多人没有一个会铸锅。因为他们突出政治，发扬了革命精神，穷干苦干，虚心学习，生产出来的铁锅，在全省十几个厂中，成本最低，质量也不错。但是到了一九六三年下半年，铁锅质量急剧下降，成品率不到百分之五十。当时厂里积压铁锅十一万口，几乎到了无钱发工资、无钱买原料的地步。
    为什么会出现这种倒退现象呢？主要是厂的领导干部滋长了骄傲自满情绪，以为“锅厂是个新摊子，能搞到这样已经不错了”。干部们不再深入车间参加劳动，“一怕累、二怕脏、三怕铁水烧衣裳”。这样，领导干部思想上政治不挂帅，怎能带动群众搞好生产呢？
    后来，在市委的帮助下，他们批判了骄傲自满思想，同工人们一起学习了《为人民服务》、《放下包袱，开动机器》等文章，明白了造成生产下降的根本原因是没有突出政治，没有用毛泽东思想挂帅。他们重新振作起革命精神，以大庆为榜样，坚持下车间参加劳动，同工人一起研究解决锅的质量问题。工厂的落后局面迅速改变，产品品种增加，成本降低，质量不断提高。一九六四、一九六五两年内，生产的铁锅，在五次全省铁锅质量评比中，三次被评为第一，一九六五年底又被评为全国质量第一。
    要同小生产者的资本主义倾向作斗争
    大家还谈到，手工业企业里，资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争很尖锐，突出的表现就是“钞票挂帅”同政治挂帅的斗争。因此，手工业部门突出政治，必须同小生产者的资本主义倾向作斗争。
    北京市房山县顾册农具修造厂厂长古德全说，过去，他们厂的一些领导干部，一心抓产值，抓利润。为了多赚钱，就派人到北京大工厂里揽一些利润高的活做，不愿意生产利润低的小农具；为了鼓励工人多干活、多挣钱，还推行了一种奖惩制度，超额给奖，亏了罚钱。结果，利润高、产值大、容易做的产品，大家抢着干；利润低、产值小、不好做的产品，不管农民怎样需要，谁也不愿意干。这种“钞票挂帅”的错误做法，既影响了对农业的支援，也造成了职工贪多图快、不顾产品质量的严重后果。光是一九六四年，由于产品不合格，工厂就损失了一万五千多元。
    后来，遵照北京市委的指示，工厂党支部组织职工学习毛主席著作《为人民服务》，接着又组织职工展开了一场“为谁服务”的大辩论。工人们尖锐地批评说：“毛主席教导我们要全心全意为人民服务，工厂领导却鼓励我们为‘人民币’服务，究竟要把我们带到哪里去？”领导干部接受了批评，在群众大会上作了检讨，取消了“钞票挂帅”的制度，实行了干部半天参加劳动的办法。全厂出现了面向农村、一心一意为农民服务的新风气。
    不用“钞票挂帅”，而用政治挂帅，能把工人的积极性调动起来么？有些人最初还怀疑，但是事实很快就把他们的怀疑打消了。职工们干劲十足，自己动手制造出几十台机器设备，把原来的“打铁铺”改造成机械化、半机械化的农具修造厂。过去“钞票挂帅”时规定一天一人做八只大锄钩，还完不成定额，现在已达到了十一只。去年，职工们设计制造了四十多种农民喜爱的改良农具，还不辞辛苦地到山区平原去为生产队修理了大量农业机具。工厂有力地支援了农业，受到了农民的欢迎，自己的生产也得到了发展。
    突出政治才能充分调动群众的积极性
    要搞好手工业生产，就得调动起全体工人的积极性。用什么办法去调动手工业工人的积极性呢？湖南益阳市湘中锅厂党支部书记邓新武说：突出政治才能充分调动手工业工人建设社会主义的积极性；搞物质刺激，就会腐蚀工人的思想，给生产造成损失。他们厂曾经一度用过高的计件工资制，来调动工人的积极性。有些工人，每月拿到的工资，大大超过当地农民的收入，也超过其他行业工人的工资水平。这样一来，手工业工人中本来就存在的“干活为了挣钱”的思想，很快发展起来。有些工人为了多拿钱，不顾质量，单纯追求数量。工厂生产的铁锅，质次价高，又厚又重，农民不愿意买。
    社会主义教育运动以后，工厂领导干部提高了认识，抓紧了政治思想工作。他们组织工人下乡，听取农民意见。工人们了解到，湖区缺柴禾，锅厚了，就要多烧柴。他们还算了一笔账，每个锅重一两，一年几十万口锅，就要浪费国家几万斤生铁。工人们回厂后就努力提高锅的质量，做到了又薄又耐用。工厂又组织工人们学习毛主席著作，使他们认识到铸造铁锅就是干革命，就是为人民服务。后来根据工人们的要求，工厂改革了不合理的奖金制度。
    政治挂了帅，职工的积极性被真正调动起来了，生产面貌迅速发生了变化。去年，工厂铁锅的质量，被评为全国第二，产量比生产最好的一九五七年提高百分之五十六，工厂的人员减少四分之一，劳动生产率提高了百分之四十五。
    必须树立全心全意为五亿农民服务的思想
    几位手工业厂社的同志都指出，支援农业是手工业的首要任务，手工业企业突出政治，就要全心全意为五亿农民服务。
    福州市台江木桶社党支部书记潘如焰同志说：过去，我们生产的木桶质量低、价格高，农民很有意见。他们说：“一担桶要四元九角多，太贵了，我们要卖五担菜才能换一担桶。”对于农民的意见，开始我们并不重视。因为领导干部当时没有树立为农民服务的思想，有单纯盈利观点，以为企业赚钱多，工人收入多，就算把合作社办好了。有的同志还说，只有国家降低木材的价格，木桶的成本才能降低。
    去年，我们开展了毛主席著作的学习活动，全厂职工认识到支援农业是手工业的首要任务，同时只有在支援农业中，企业才能得到不断的壮大和发展。接着，我们开展了群众性技术革新和技术革命活动，用自力更生大搞机械化的办法，降低生产成本。
    过去，有人认为，我们厂没有人会设计绘图，没有机器设备，缺少资金，缺乏材料，不能搞技术革新。突出政治以后，大家振奋起革命精神，脑子也变灵了。我们采取了“五自”措施（设计绘图自己干，专业人员自己抽，革新设备自己造，没有资金自己筹，缺乏材料自己找），去年一年就制成了二十多台专用设备，基本上实现了“木桶生产一条龙”。木材的利用率显著提高了，过去一立方米木材，只能生产二十担桶，现在能生产三十几担桶；同时生产效率大为提高。木桶的成本显著降低，每担桶的价格由过去的四元九角多，下降到二元九角多，农民十分满意。这件事说明：突出政治，树立全心全意为农民服务的思想，才能更好地激发职工们自力更生的革命精神，达到更好地支援农业的目的。
    手工业领导部门首先要坚持正确的方向
    手工业领导部门在突出政治中存在一些什么问题呢？辽宁锦州市手工业局副局长何紫桥说：要领导好手工业厂社的生产，首先就要抓政治，用政治来统帅业务，使手工业生产坚持正确的方向；反之，如果只抓钱抓设备，不抓政治，见物不见人，手工业厂社的生产就会走上邪路，给国家和集体都带来损失。
    他举了一个锦州剪刀生产合作社的例子。从一九六○年到一九六三年，这个社的经营情况一直不好，赔蚀了四十多万元。过去，他们只从业务上去找原因，认为是手工业社的设备差、技术差，就拨给他们八万元钱，派人到杭州张小泉、北京王麻子等“剪刀大王”那里去买设备，学技术。没有料到，机器买来了，技术也学了，生产依然没有起色，亏蚀局面仍未改变。这时，局的领导干部才到这个社里去蹲点调查，发现这个社生产搞不好的根本原因，不是缺乏物质条件，而是政治没有挂帅；多数工人对“为谁劳动”的问题认识不清，认为“干活就是为了挣钱吃饭”；有少数觉悟较高、一心想把社办好的老工人，很孤立，甚至受到打击。许多情况说明，在这个社里两条道路的斗争很尖锐，这就是生产长期亏蚀的原因所在。
    手工业局的领导同志这时才认识到，要把这个社领导好，不能靠给钱给设备，首先要给他们政治。于是，领导这个社开展了忆苦思甜的阶级教育，大学毛主席著作，又进行了“为谁劳动”的讨论。职工们提高了阶级觉悟，许多人检查了自己要离社去单干的错误思想，过去受到孤立的老工人成了大家学习的先进榜样。
    有了正确的方向，全社技术革新开展得很热烈，技术难题一个个解决了，生产面貌迅速改观。现在，这个社的产品由于质量提高，已由过去的积压状况变为供不应求了，剪刀的生产成本也由过去的每把八角多，下降到每把四角多，企业由亏本转为盈余。（附图片）
