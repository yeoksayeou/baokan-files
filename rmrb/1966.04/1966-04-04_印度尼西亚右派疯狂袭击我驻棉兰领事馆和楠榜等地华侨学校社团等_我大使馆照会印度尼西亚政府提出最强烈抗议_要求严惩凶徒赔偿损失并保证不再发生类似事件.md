　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd—The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia submitted a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on April 2nd, lodging the strongest protest against the serious incident of the third frantic attack by thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces on the Chinese Consulate in Medan.

　　The note stated that at approximately 11:40 AM on March 29th, more than 1,000 thugs claiming to be from the "Arif Rahman Ambeta Brigade of the Unified Action Organization of Indonesian Youth and Students" arrived in front of the Chinese Consulate in Medan, shouting anti-China slogans such as "Crush the People's Republic of China," "Take over the Chinese Consulate," "Drive out the Chinese Consul," and "Expel the Chinese Overseas." A portion of the thugs forcibly broke into the consulate courtyard, brazenly raised the Indonesian flag at the Chinese Consulate, and seized the Chinese national emblem and the consulate's plaque. They also hung a large paper banner on the door of the consulate hall, which read "Unified Action Organization of Youth and Students of North Sumatra, Adelma Suriani Nasution Battalion," posted many insulting and anti-China slogans, and threw a so-called "statement" in the consulate courtyard, wantonly slandering and defaming the People's Republic of China, openly threatening the Chinese Consul, demanding that he "leave Indonesia immediately," and shouting, "Close the Chinese representative office in Medan." By 1:30 PM, some thugs had again frantically jumped over the wall and broke into the consulate's backyard, smashing the consulate's doors and windows with stones and looting some items. They also climbed onto the roof, destroying tiles and ceilings. Their attack and destruction of the consulate lasted for two hours and thirty minutes.

　　The note emphasized that in this serious incident, the military police specifically responsible for guarding the Chinese Consulate took no measures to stop the thugs, and although the consulate security personnel repeatedly called the local authorities, they were ignored. This demonstrates the extent to which the Medan local authorities condoned the thugs.

　　The note pointed out that the incident occurred after the consulate staff had been unable to perform their duties normally and had just been ordered to withdraw to Jakarta, and also after the embassy had sent a special note to the Indonesian government, requesting that the relevant local authorities be notified to protect the consulate and its security personnel. This crime of violating consular privileges, disregarding international law, and deliberately worsening relations between the two countries cannot but arouse great indignation. The Chinese Embassy lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government against the above-mentioned acts of violence.

　　The note requests that the Indonesian government publicly apologize for the above-mentioned acts of violence, immediately return the Chinese national emblem and the consulate's plaque seized by the thugs, severely punish the perpetrators and instigators of the incident, compensate for all losses to the Chinese Consulate, and take effective measures to ensure the safety of the Chinese Consulate and its security personnel, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. It stated that the Indonesian government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences arising from the repeated occurrence of such provocative incidents.

　　Xinhua News Agency, 3rd—The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on April 2nd, strongly protesting the serious incidents of attacks, destruction, and looting of overseas Chinese schools, organizations, shops, and residences in Nanbang, Zhanbi, and other places by thugs organized by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.

　　The note stated that on the morning of March 21st, in Lukbutong and Tanjungkarang City in Nanbang Province, more than 1,000 thugs claiming to be from the "Unified Action Organization of Indonesian University Students" and the "Unified Action Organization of Indonesian Youth and Students," after participating in the "Mass Rally in Support of President Sukarno's Authorization of Lieutenant General Suharto," in batches carried out frantic attacks, destruction, and looting of local overseas Chinese organizations, schools, shops, and residences. The thugs shouted anti-China slogans such as "Expel the Chinks" and "Sever diplomatic relations with Beijing" along the way. Subsequently, they broke into the office of the Nanbang Overseas Chinese General Association, openly seized the Chinese flag, tore up the portrait of Chairman Liu Shaoqi, smashed doors, windows, furniture, and office supplies, and threatened the person in charge of the General Association with sharp knives, declaring that they would "take over." These thugs then destroyed the premises of the Overseas Chinese Women's Association, the Overseas Chinese Youth Federation, and the Fujian Guild Hall, as well as the Hualian, Xinzhong, and Qinglian Overseas Chinese schools, and wantonly carried out destruction and looting of hundreds of overseas Chinese shops and residences. During the violence, the thugs also stabbed and injured many overseas Chinese with sharp knives and iron bars, among whom Mao Jinzhou, Deng Baohe, and Li Jingxing were especially seriously injured.

　　The note pointed out that it is noteworthy that these thugs obtained a permit signed by the Nanbang military authorities before carrying out their "demonstration." The local authorities neither made any effort to prevent the occurrence of the acts of violence beforehand, nor did they take effective measures to stop them during the four-hour-long acts of violence. At the same time as the above-mentioned incidents occurred, thugs organized by right-wing reactionary forces also carried out the same racist violence against overseas Chinese in the Zhanbi area. Several overseas Chinese schools were severely damaged and illegally occupied, and some overseas Chinese shops and residences were also destroyed.

　　The note stated that the Chinese Embassy expresses great indignation at the above-mentioned acts of violence and lodges a strong protest with the Indonesian government.

　　The note requests that the Indonesian government publicly apologize for the rude behavior of insulting the Chinese flag and national leaders, severely punish the perpetrators and instigators of the above-mentioned incidents, take practical and effective measures to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese organizations, schools, and individual overseas Chinese are not violated, compensate for the losses of overseas Chinese property, find ways to assist the restoration of overseas Chinese shops that have been damaged, provide relief and resettlement to overseas Chinese who have lost their livelihoods due to the damage, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

    印度尼西亚右派疯狂袭击我驻棉兰领事馆和楠榜等地华侨学校社团等
    我大使馆照会印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议
    要求严惩凶徒赔偿损失并保证不再发生类似事件
    新华社三日讯　中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆四月二日向印度尼西亚共和国外交部提交一份照会，最强烈地抗议印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒第三次疯狂袭击中国驻棉兰领事馆的严重事件。
    照会说，三月二十九日上午十一时四十分左右，有一千余名自称为“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织阿里夫·拉赫曼安贝拉旅”的暴徒，来到中国驻棉兰领事馆门前，高喊“粉碎中华人民共和国”、“接管中国领事馆”、“赶走中国领事”和“驱逐中国侨民”等反华口号。一部分暴徒强行闯入领事馆院内，蛮横地在中国领事馆升起印度尼西亚的国旗，劫走了中国国徽和领事馆的铜牌。他们还在领事馆大厅门上挂起大幅纸版，上面写着“北苏门答腊青年学生统一行动组织，阿德尔玛·苏里阿尼·纳苏第温营”字样，张贴了许多辱华、反华的标语，并把一份所谓的“声明书”丢在领事馆院内，对中华人民共和国恣意诽谤和污蔑，公然威胁中国领事，要他“立即离开印度尼西亚”，并且叫嚷，“关闭中国驻棉兰的代表机构”。到下午一时三十分，有一些暴徒又疯狂地跳墙闯入领事馆后院，用石块猛击领事馆的门窗，抢走一些物品。他们还爬上屋顶，捣毁屋瓦和天花板。他们对领事馆的袭击破坏，持续了两小时三十分之久。
    照会强调指出，在这次严重的事件中，专门负责守卫中国领事馆的军警，对暴徒未采取任何制止措施，领事馆看守人员虽多次打电话给地方当局，也被置之不理，可见棉兰地方当局对暴徒的纵容已到何等程度。
    照会指出，这次事件的发生，是在领事馆人员已无法正常执行其职务，奉命刚刚撤至雅加达之后，也是在大使馆特别照会了印度尼西亚政府，要求通知有关地方当局保护领事馆及其看守人员的安全之后。这种侵犯领事特权，无视国际法准则，蓄意恶化两国关系的罪行，不能不令人感到极大的愤慨。对上述暴行事件，中国大使馆特向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会要求印度尼西亚政府就上述暴行公开道歉，立即归还被暴徒劫走的中国国徽和领事馆的铜牌，严惩事件的肇事者和主使人，赔偿中国领事馆的一切损失，并切实采取有效措施，保障中国领事馆及其看守人员的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。它说，由这类挑衅事件的再三出现所引起的严重后果，必须由印度尼西亚政府完全承担责任。
    新华社三日讯　中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆四月二日照会印度尼西亚共和国外交部，强烈抗议印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒袭击、破坏和抢劫楠榜、占碑等地华侨学校、社团、商店和住宅的严重事件。
    照会说，三月二十一日上午，楠榜省的鹿勿洞、丹绒加冷市有自称为“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”、“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”的暴徒一千余人，在参加了“支持苏加诺总统授权苏哈托中将的群众大会”后，分批向当地华侨社团、学校、商店、住宅进行疯狂的袭击、破坏和抢劫。暴徒沿途高喊“驱逐支那人”、“同北京断绝邦交”等反华口号，随后，他们冲入楠榜华侨总会办事处，公然劫走中国国旗，撕毁刘少奇主席的挂象，捣毁门窗、家具和办公用品，并以利刀威胁总会负责人，声言要进行“接管”。这些暴徒随后又捣毁了华侨妇女会、华侨青联会和福建会馆三个团体的会所和华联、新中、青联三所华侨学校，并对数百户华侨商店和住宅恣意进行了破坏和抢劫。在暴行中，暴徒还用利刀、铁棒刺伤和击伤华侨多人，其中毛锦洲、邓保和、李景星三人的伤势尤为严重。
    照会指出，值得注意的是，这些暴徒在进行“游行示威”以前，取得了楠榜军事当局签发的准字，地方当局事先既未设法防止暴行事件的发生，在长达四小时的暴行过程中，又未采取有效的措施加以制止。而在发生上述事件的同时，右派反动势力组织的暴徒，对占碑地区的华侨，也进行了同样的种族主义的暴行，有几所华侨学校受到严重的破坏，并被非法侵占，有些华侨商店和住宅也遭到捣毁。
    照会说，中国大使馆对上述暴行事件，表示极大的愤慨，特向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈抗议。
    照会要求印度尼西亚政府对侮辱中国国旗和国家领导人的粗野行为，公开道歉，严惩上述事件的肇事者和主使人，采取切实有效的措施，保障华侨团体、学校和华侨个人的正当权益不受侵犯，赔偿华侨财产的损失，对被破坏的华侨商店，设法协助其复业，对因受破坏而丧失生计的华侨，应给予救济和安置，并保证不再发生类似事件。
