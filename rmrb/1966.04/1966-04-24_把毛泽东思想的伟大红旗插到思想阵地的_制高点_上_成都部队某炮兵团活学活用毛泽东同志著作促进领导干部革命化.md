    Raise the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought to the "Commanding Heights" of the Ideological Front
    A Certain Artillery Regiment of the Chengdu Military Region Vigorously Studies and Applies Comrade Mao Zedong's Works to Promote the Revolutionization of Leading Cadres
    Editor's Note: The leading cadres of a certain artillery regiment of the Chengdu Military Region, vigorously study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works, focusing on resolving major issues in leadership ideology and leadership style, and working hard on the revolutionization of leading cadres. Their experience is very enlightening.
    Leading cadres studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works must also first use it to transform their own thinking. This principle seems simple to state, but it is not so easy to do, and requires breaking through a series of ideological obstacles. How to carry out self-revolution and self-transformation more effectively? The comrades of the artillery regiment have learned: First, "admit the debt" and do not adopt "non-recognitionism" towards shortcomings; second, show enough courage and not be afraid of pain or itching; third, be strict with oneself and not forgive oneself; fourth, improve understanding from basic viewpoints and not deal with matters on a case-by-case basis. As a result of their doing so, the old problem of arrogance and complacency has been overcome relatively quickly, and the consciousness of ideological transformation has also been greatly improved.
    The ideological revolutionization of leading cadres is not only related to the personal problems of leading cadres, but also to whether a unit, a region, or a department can truly achieve revolutionization. Just as the comrades of the artillery regiment said: The ideology of leading cadres is the "commanding height" of the entire ideological front. Only by firmly planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought on this "commanding height" can we ensure that Mao Zedong Thought occupies a dominant position on the entire ideological front, and can we better realize the revolutionization of the entire unit, region, and department.

    In the past two years, the leading cadres of our regiment have mainly focused their efforts on strengthening the revolutionization of the leading group when studying Chairman Mao's works. We have used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to transform our thinking, improve Party committee life, and improve leadership style, and have achieved some preliminary results and gained some superficial experiences.

    Starting from solving the problem of arrogance and complacency, strengthening ideological revolutionization

    In the past, the level of ideological revolutionization of our leading group was not well adapted to the requirements of troop construction. The main problem was arrogance, complacency, and sticking to old ways. This problem became a major obstacle to the ideological transformation of leading cadres, directly affecting the collective leadership of the Party committee and hindering the revolutionary construction of the troops. We have had many lessons in this regard. We have learned from these lessons that the ideology of the Party committee leadership is the "commanding height" of the ideological front of the troops. Only when leading cadres hold high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the lead in transforming their thinking, and take the lead in realizing ideological revolutionization, can the ideological front of the entire unit be consolidated.

    Since the second half of 1963, we have repeatedly conducted "opposing arrogance and complacency, advocating modesty and prudence" studies five times. In light of the ideological characteristics of leading cadres, we used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to carry out active ideological struggle and did some arduous and meticulous work, and the problem was solved relatively well.

    First, dare to face up to shortcomings. We had long noticed the problem of arrogance and complacency among leading cadres and had already begun to address it, but for a period of time, we were unable to break through. Why did this happen? The main reason was a lack of self-awareness. We couldn't grasp our own problems and adopted a liberal attitude towards our own shortcomings. After the Party Central Committee called for strengthening mutual learning and overcoming sticking to old ways, arrogance, and complacency, we immediately seized the opportunity and repeatedly conducted self-examination. After a period of self-investigation and research, everyone's minds calmed down, their attitudes became serious, and comrades with arrogant and complacent emotions revealed their "bottom line," realizing that "arrogance and complacency is already a form of blindness, and we cannot add blindness to blindness by adopting a non-recognition attitude." "If the Central Committee rings the alarm bell, we cannot act like a dull bell. If we don't sound when struck, we will make a big mistake." In this way, we initially opened up the situation for solving the problem.

    Have the courage to put down "old burdens." Facing up to mistakes is only the beginning of correcting them. The problems of leading cadres are mostly "old burdens" with relatively strong ingrained habits. Without enough courage, it is impossible to solve the problem of ingrained habits. This courage is the spirit of self-revolution. In order to help some comrades summon enough courage to boldly put down "old burdens," we re-studied "Lay Down the Burden and Start Up the Machine," examined the lessons learned in Party committee life and personal work, and realized that "old burdens" must be put down and can be put down. Some comrades said: "We, these not-so-big cadres, often have problems that are taken care of a little by our superiors, understood a little by our peers, and respected a little by our subordinates. If we are not more conscious ourselves, and our determination is not firm, and our courage is not enough, it is impossible to solve the problem." With the courage of self-revolution boosted, some comrades took the initiative to hold forums in agencies and companies, laying out their problems to the masses for "consultation." In the past, the masses reflected that Deputy Political Commissar Guo Chengxiang "criticized people meticulously but helped people generously." Through study, he realized that this was the result of arrogance and complacency. Therefore, he went deep into the companies, put down his airs, and lived, ate, and worked alongside the soldiers, transforming himself. At the same time, starting from the needs of his work at the time, he analyzed twenty-seven examples of grasping living ideas, summed up experience, and helped grassroots cadres and backbone elements learn to grasp living ideas, improving the level of ideological work in the companies. The masses reflected that the Deputy Political Commissar's meticulous criticism had turned into meticulous help.

    Strictly demand oneself in every word and deed. Once, the military region's sports team came to the troops to visit and perform, and asked us to talk about the glorious traditions of the troops. We nominated Regiment Commander Nie Zhiyi to speak. Comrade Nie Zhiyi was a hero with seven merits and had a glorious experience in the Battle of the Wanshan Islands. He told the comrades of the sports team the story of a company commander commanding wooden boats to fight warships during this battle. The comrades of the sports team asked who this company commander was? Comrade Nie Zhiyi said: There are many such company commanders! In fact, this company commander was himself. Later, someone asked him, "Why did you tell people a story about someone without a name?" He said, "What we want to promote is the entire army, not ourselves." This matter was very enlightening to others. The reason why Comrade Nie Zhiyi overcame his arrogance and complacency relatively quickly was mainly because he strictly demanded himself in every word and deed. If leading cadres want to achieve results in transforming their thinking, they cannot succeed without the spirit of strict self-discipline. The higher the position, the stricter the demands on oneself must be; one cannot adopt a "big, low, loose" attitude towards oneself (that is, being a bigger cadre, having lower standards, and managing oneself more loosely). Some comrades' "old burdens" are always not put down decisively, putting them down today and picking them up again tomorrow, precisely because they lack this spirit. This is a major obstacle to ideological revolutionization. Recognizing this point, we strive to be stricter with ourselves and manage ourselves more tightly. Because of this strict self-demand and strict collective life, everyone's results in transforming their thinking come faster.

    Work hard on basic viewpoints. Among the cadres in our regiment, there are heroes with seven merits, special-class heroes, and cadres who have consistently received commendations. The reason why these comrades have arrogance and complacency in their thinking is mainly the result of two kinds of blindness: one is blindness towards one's "old capital"; the other is blindness towards the new situation of class struggle. The past things have become burdens, and the new things cannot be understood. Naturally, there will be a stagnant mood of sticking to old ways. In order to solve the problem of arrogance and complacency more thoroughly among leading cadres, we have repeatedly studied two basic ideas: one is the idea that the people are the masters of history, and the other is the idea of thorough revolution. Through studying Chairman Mao's report at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee of the Party and other related works, studying Chairman Mao's expositions on class struggle, we have further clarified our understanding of this principle: the people are the real heroes, the greatest contributors to history. "We must not only be vigilant against the bourgeoisie coming to praise us, but also be vigilant against praising ourselves"; we also realize that "the road of class struggle, the road of revolution is still very long, we must revolutionize to the end, and be thorough revolutionaries." Chairman Mao pointed out at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee that our past victory was only a short prelude to a long drama. This idea has given us a great education. We realize that no matter how well the prelude is performed, we cannot be arrogant, complacent, stagnant, or close the curtain. We must also prepare to perform the main drama, the great drama of world revolution. We deeply realize that standing at the height of Mao Zedong Thought to view revolution and view our cause, our spiritual world can be liberated from low-level tastes, our minds will be broadened, our consideration of personal gains and losses will be reduced, and our revolutionary spirit will be invigorated.

    Starting from solving the problem of arrogance and complacency, the situation of ideological transformation of leading cadres has been further opened up, and two gratifying phenomena have emerged: First, everyone can honestly study Chairman Mao's works with problems in mind, no longer acting as "commentators" and "critics" in learning as they did in the past. Some comrades repeatedly studied "On Practice" and "On Contradiction" sixteen times in order to overcome one-sidedness in their way of thinking, and achieved results; some comrades, in order to overcome purely military viewpoints, took Chairman Mao's works to the masses, soliciting their opinions while studying, and made great progress. Second, everyone can honestly go to practice to transform themselves, absorbing nourishment from the masses and enriching themselves. In the past two years, most of the leading cadres in our regiment have spent more than half of their time working in companies, putting down their airs, and living, eating, and working alongside the soldiers, strengthening their ideological transformation.

      Correctly carry out inner-Party struggle, promote the revolutionization of Party committee life

    The ideological revolutionization of leading members and the revolutionization of Party committee life are mutually combined and mutually reinforcing. While grasping the ideological transformation of leading members, we also grasped the improvement of Party committee life, so that the Party committee truly became the core of unity and leadership of the troops. Unity is an important sign of the revolutionization of the leading group. In this regard, we also had some problems in the past. For more than two years, through studying Chairman Mao's theory on Party building, we have actively carried out ideological struggle in Party committee life, further strengthened the unity of the Party committee, and brought into play the collective leadership of the Party committee.

    View people and oneself with a one-divides-into-two approach. In Party committee life, there must be a one-divides-into-two viewpoint. If we look at problems more comprehensively and speak more accurately, a leading group can more easily reach a common language, respect each other, achieve unity, and work together actively. How to apply one-divides-into-two in Party committee life? We paid attention to three points: First, we strive to "divide" accurately in terms of strengths and weaknesses, achievements and mistakes. We cannot divide our own strengths excessively, and we cannot divide other people's weaknesses excessively. If we divide excessively, we will say too much and do too much, creating estrangement. Second, we must adopt a positive attitude to "divide". After dividing our own shortcomings, we must earnestly correct them and not forgive ourselves under the pretext of "old habits"; after dividing other people's shortcomings, we must enthusiastically help them and not watch the "excitement." In this way, with correction and help, we can promote each other and improve together. Third, we cannot "divide" statically. For ourselves, we must see that new problems will arise even after the old problems are corrected, and we must always divide and correct; for others, we must allow people to correct their shortcomings and acknowledge their progress. We deeply realize that in Party committee life, adhering to one-divides-into-two for both people and ourselves is not only conducive to our own progress, but also conducive to other people's progress, and even more conducive to the progress of the collective.

    Take right and wrong, not wrong and wrong. We deeply realize that avoiding unprincipled disputes and carrying out principled struggles are important issues in the revolutionization of Party committee life. Here, the key issue is to take the right over the wrong, not the wrong over the wrong. We have had lessons in this regard, having experienced cases of confronting partiality with partiality and extremism with extremism. Later, we studied Chairman Mao's instructions on criticism and self-criticism and Comrade Liu Shaoqi's "On the Self-Cultivation of Communists." Through summing up positive and negative experiences, we understood that we must start from the desire for unity, stand on the correct side, and not return an inaccuracy with another inaccuracy. This is a principled issue in correctly carrying out inner-Party struggle. Sometimes, even if we are in the position of the party concerned and have been wronged, we must still take right over wrong and not make a fuss from a personal perspective. Secondly, we also realize that in order to take right over wrong in Party committee life, the secretary must remain calm in the face of events, recognize the opportune moment, and not organize "tit-for-tat" struggles when both sides are heated. It is difficult to distinguish right from wrong in this way. Although solving some problems too late is unfavorable, solving them too hastily may not be successful. If the timing is chosen well and individual work is done first, the problem can be solved more smoothly.

    Seek uniformity in non-uniformity. A leading group of ten or so people will inevitably be non-uniform in terms of ideological level, struggle experience, and work style. In the past, we did not understand this point and always complained that the group was not uniform, without actively striving for uniformity. After studying "On Contradiction" and "Methods of Work of Party Committees," we understood that non-uniformity is absolute and normal. One of the important contents of Party committee life is to seek relative uniformity in non-uniformity, so as to give full play to the role of collective leadership. Since then, we have had the consciousness to actively strive for uniformity. From our practice in recent years, we have learned that in order to seek uniformity in non-uniformity, we must first acknowledge non-uniformity so that we will not blame heaven and earth and can resolve to work together. When a comrade first came, he had ideological burdens and did not work boldly. We did not discriminate against him, but warmly welcomed him, encouraged him to drop his burdens, and strengthen himself. He was very moved, worked very actively, and made rapid progress. He was able to actively follow up on what the Party committee wanted to do. In this way, the work can be done well by seeking relative uniformity in the team. Secondly, we must, as Chairman Mao taught, not be afraid of differences of opinion, give full play to democracy, and let everyone finish speaking. Through debate, distinguishing right from wrong, and finding the truth, there will be a real common language and unified action. Third, the work of unifying thinking cannot be completely entrusted to meetings. Especially for those major principled issues and more complex issues, we must conduct individual consultations, do a good job of dredging work, and strive to hold meetings after everyone's thinking is prepared and opinions are relatively close. In this way, meetings can take fewer detours, "butt heads" less, and quickly unify understanding and carry out work in a unified manner.

    Apply dialectics in practical work, promote the revolutionization of leadership style

    The fundamental purpose of the revolutionization of the leading group is to do a good job of leadership and strengthen the construction of the troops. In the past, there were also many problems with the leadership style of our regiment: superficiality, passivity, and generalization, so the progress of the troops' work was relatively slow. In the process of gradually strengthening the ideological revolutionization of leading members and the revolutionization of Party committee life, we also emphasized the need to further solve the problem of the revolutionization of leadership style. We must study Chairman Mao's revolutionary dialectics with a revolutionary spirit in practical work, learning and revolutionizing at the same time, so that there will be less metaphysics and more dialectics in leadership work, and we can do a good job of face-to-face leadership.

    Be both a leader and a pacesetter. In the past, the reason why our work was not effective enough was that we only thought about being leaders and did not think about being pacesetters ourselves, and we did not set an example in everything. Chairman Mao has always taught us that the exemplary role of leaders is an important condition for doing a good job of leadership. Especially for the leaders at the regiment level in our regiment, who meet with the masses every day, if they cannot play a demonstrative and leading role themselves, it will be difficult to implement the Party's line, principles, and policies well. We did not understand this point well enough in the past, and many tasks could not be carried out, especially in grasping the fundamental construction problem of studying Chairman Mao's works in the troops. We did some work in the previous years, but the effect was not great. What was the reason? We couldn't understand it at the time. Later, the higher-level organs came to inspect the work and immediately pointed it out to us. The key was that the leading group of our regiment itself did not study ahead of time and take the lead in studying well. Since then, we have resolved to study and set an example for the troops, and a study craze quickly appeared throughout the regiment.

    Be both specific and avoid sophistry. To implement, we must grasp specifically, grasp concretely. In the past, we did not distinguish between the boundaries of concreteness and sophistry, and there were two deviations: If we want to be specific, we engage in sophistry; and if we oppose sophistry, we do not do concrete work. In this way, we were not specific when we should have been, and we engaged in sophistry when we should not have been. After studying "On Contradiction," we understood that sophistry is a rambling, trivial listing of phenomena, failing to grasp the essence of things, going around in circles, and making it difficult for people to grasp the key points. And grasping specifically is by no means simply grasping phenomena, but requires grasping the essence of things. These two are fundamentally different. Grasping specifically to truly solve the problem is by no means sophistry; engaging in sophistry cannot solve specific problems. After having this understanding, on the one hand, we paid attention to not doing things that made it difficult for people to grasp the key points. On the other hand, in the process of going to the companies to stay at the grassroots level, we paid attention to grasping those meaningful "small topics" and practically solving a number of specific problems for the companies. By solving these specific problems, we further realized that many things, seen in isolation, are small things, but from a global perspective, they are big things. Therefore, we must seriously grasp specific problems. In the process of grasping, as long as we grasp the key points, use the right methods, and are good at starting from points and blossoming on the surface, we will not fall into事務主義 [Shìwù zhǔyì] and can avoid sophistry.

    Strive to have more initiative. In the past, our work was relatively passive. We were busy all year round, mostly "plugging loopholes," and we always felt a lot of pressure ideologically and could not stretch our hands and feet at work. Through studying Chairman Mao's expositions on striving for the initiative, we understood the importance of striving for the initiative in work and realized that it is possible to get rid of the passive situation in work, and we often pay attention to striving for the initiative from passivity. At present, although there is still a passive situation in our work, we have gained some initiative after all. How did we strive for this initiative? First, firmly grasp the fundamentals. By grasping the fundamentals, we have gained basic initiative. In these years, we have always grasped the fundamental of studying Chairman Mao's works, so that the work has also been more developed and there has been less passive coping. By grasping the fundamentals, even if some passivity occurs, it is only small passivity, not big passivity, which is easy to get rid of. Second, start the ideological machine and learn to grasp the essence of things. By grasping the essence of things, we can master the initiative in solving specific problems. In 1963, the troops were replenished with a batch of new soldiers from Guizhou. At that time, many company and platoon cadres reflected that these soldiers were "not easy to lead," and some problems occurred in management and education work for a time. Where was the essence of the problem? We did not grasp it at the time, and we were very passive. Later, after investigation and research, we discovered that the grassroots cadres used "regional analysis" rather than "class analysis" in their views on the soldiers from Guizhou. This was the essence of the problem. By grasping this essential problem, we organized cadres to re-study Chairman Mao's methods of class analysis, correct their understanding, and correct their prejudices, and the problems in management and education work were solved. Third, think of a few more ideas when something happens. If there is only one idea in work, we can sometimes fight an active battle, but sometimes we cannot, and if we estimate all the possibilities and have a few more ideas, we can fight an active battle more steadily.

    把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插到思想阵地的“制高点”上
    成都部队某炮兵团活学活用毛泽东同志著作促进领导干部革命化
    编者按：成都部队某炮兵团的领导干部，活学活用毛泽东同志著作，着重解决领导思想、领导作风上的一些重大问题，在领导干部革命化上下功夫。他们的经验对人很有启发。
    领导干部学习毛泽东同志著作，同样要首先用来改造自己的思想。这个道理，说起来似乎不难，做起来却不那么容易，需要打破一系列的思想障碍。如何更有成效地进行自我革命、自我改造？炮兵团同志们的体会是：一要“认账”，不要对缺点采取“不承认主义”；二要拿出足够的勇气，不要怕疼怕痒；三要严格要求，不能自我原谅；四要从基本观点上提高认识，不要就事论事。他们这样做的结果，骄傲自满的老毛病，克服得比较快，思想改造的自觉性，也有了很大的提高。
    领导干部的思想革命化，不仅关系到领导干部个人的问题，而且关系到一个单位、一个地区、一个部门能不能真正实现革命化的问题。正象炮兵团的同志们所说的：领导干部的思想，是整个思想阵地的“制高点”。首先必须在这个“制高点”上，牢牢地插上毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，才能保证毛泽东思想在整个思想阵地上占据统治的地位，才能更好地实现整个单位、地区和部门的革命化。
    近两年来，我们团的领导干部学习毛主席著作，主要是在加强领导班子革命化上，下了一些功夫。我们以毛泽东思想为武器，改造自己的思想，改善党委生活，改进领导作风，初步取得了一些成绩，有了一些粗浅的体会。
    从解决骄傲自满问题入手，加强思想革命化
    过去，我们这个领导班子的思想革命化水平是不大适应部队建设的要求的。主要问题是骄傲自满，故步自封。这个问题，成为领导干部思想改造的一大障碍，直接影响了党委的集体领导，妨碍了部队的革命化建设。在这方面，我们有过不少教训。我们从教训中认识到：党委班子的思想，是部队思想阵地的“制高点”。只有领导干部高举毛泽东思想红旗，带头改造思想，带头实现思想革命化，整个部队的思想阵地才能巩固。
    从一九六三年下半年以来，我们反复五次进行了“反对骄傲自满，提倡谦虚谨慎”的学习。针对领导干部的思想特点，以毛泽东思想为武器，开展了积极的思想斗争，做了一些艰苦细致的工作，问题解决得比较好。
    首先要敢于正视缺点。我们对领导干部中的骄傲自满问题，本来早就有所发觉，也早就在着手解决，但是，在一个时期内始终打不开局面。为什么会出现这种情况呢？主要原因是缺乏自知之明，自己抓不住自己的问题，对自己的毛病采取自由主义。党中央号召加强相互学习，克服故步自封、骄傲自满以后，我们立即抓紧机会，反复进行对照检查。经过一番自我调查研究，大家的头脑冷静了，态度严肃了，有骄傲自满情绪的同志，把自己的“底”端出来了，认识到“骄傲自满已经是一种盲目性了，不能在一个盲目性上再加一个盲目性，采取不认账的态度。”“中央敲警钟，我们自己不能当闷钟。敲而不响，就要犯大错误。”这样，便初步地打开了解决问题的局面。
    要有放“老包袱”的勇气。正视错误只是改正错误的一个开端。领导干部身上的毛病，大都是“老包袱”，固癖性比较重。解决固癖性的问题，没有足够的勇气是不行的。这个勇气，就是自我革命的精神。为了帮助有些同志拿出足够的勇气来，大胆地放下“老包袱”，我们重新学习了《放下包袱，开动机器》，检查了党委生活和个人工作上的教训，认识到“老包袱”是必须放下的，也是能够放下的。有的同志说：“我们这些不大不小的干部，有了毛病，常常是上级照顾一点，同级谅解一点，下级敬你一点，如果自己再不自觉一点，决心不硬一点，勇气不足一点，是不可能解决问题的。”自我革命的勇气鼓起来了，有的同志便主动地到机关和连队去召开座谈会，向群众摊开自己的问题，让群众“会诊”。过去，群众反映副政委郭呈祥同志“批评人无微不至，帮助人大手大脚”。通过学习，他认识到这是骄傲自满的结果，于是深入连队，放下架子，同战士“五同”，改造自己。同时从当时的工作需要出发，解剖了二十七个抓活思想的事例，总结出经验，帮助基层干部和骨干分子学会抓活思想，提高了连队思想工作的水平。群众反映：副政委的无微不至的批评，变成无微不至的帮助了。
    在一言一行中严格要求自己。有一次，军区体工队到部队来访问表演，要求给他们谈谈部队的光荣传统。我们推选团长聂志义同志去讲。聂志义同志是七大功功臣，在万山群岛战役中有过一段光荣的经历。他就给体工队同志讲了这次战役中一位连长指挥木船打军舰的故事。体工队的同志问这个连长是谁？聂志义同志说：这样的连长有的是嘛！其实，这个连长就是他自己。后来，有人问他：“为什么给人家讲了个没姓没名的故事？”他说：“我们要宣扬的是整个军队，不能去宣扬自己。”这件事对其他人很有启发。聂志义同志的骄傲自满情绪所以克服得比较快，主要就是靠在一言一行中严格地要求自己。领导干部要想在改造思想上取得成果，没有严格律己的精神是不行的。职位越高，对自己的要求越要严；不能对自己采取“大、低、松”的态度（就是干部大一点，标准低一点，管自己松一点）。有的同志的“老包袱”总是放得不干脆，今天放下，明天又背起，正是由于缺乏这种精神。这是思想革命化的一个大障碍。认识到这一点，我们就努力去做到对自己要求严些，把自己管得紧些，由于这样自我要求从严，集体生活从严，大家改造思想的成果就来得快一些了。
    在基本观点上下功夫。我们团的干部中，有七大功功臣，有特等功臣，也有一贯受表扬的干部。这些同志思想上所以产生骄傲自满情绪，主要是两种盲目性的结果：一是对自己的“老本钱”有盲目性；二是对阶级斗争的新形势有盲目性。过去的东西成了包袱，新的东西不能认识，自然就产生了故步自封的停顿情绪。为了在领导干部中比较彻底地解决骄傲自满问题，我们反复地学了两个基本思想：一是人民群众是历史的主人的思想，二是彻底革命的思想。通过学习毛主席在党的七届二中全会上的报告和其他有关著作，学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的论述，进一步明确认识了这样一个道理：人民群众才是真正的英雄，是历史的最大功臣。“我们不仅要警惕资产阶级来捧我们的场，而且要警惕自己捧自己的场”；我们还认识到“阶级斗争的道路，革命的道路还很长，一定要革命到底，当彻底革命派”。毛主席在七届二中全会上指出：我们过去的胜利，只不过是一出长剧中的一个短小的序幕。这个思想，给了我们很大的教育。我们认识到：序幕演得再好，也不能骄傲自满，停滞不前，关了大幕。我们还要准备演大剧，演世界革命这幕大剧。我们深深体会到，站在毛泽东思想的高度来看革命，看事业，我们的精神世界就能从低级趣味中解放出来，胸怀就宽阔了，考虑个人得失就少了，革命精神就振作起来了。
    从解决骄傲自满问题入手，领导干部思想改造的局面进一步打开了，出现了两种可喜的现象：一是大家能老老实实地带着问题去学习毛主席著作，不再象过去那样在学习中当“评论员”、“批评家”了。有的同志为了克服思想方法上的片面性，反复十六次学习《实践论》《矛盾论》，取得了成效；有的同志为了克服单纯军事观点，拿着毛主席著作到群众中去，一边征求群众的意见，一边学习，有了很大的进步。二是大家能老老实实地到实践中去改造自己，从群众中吸取营养，丰富自己。近两年来，我们团的领导干部，大多数同志有一半以上的时间在连队蹲点，放下架子，与战士“五同”，加强了自己的思想改造。
      正确进行党内斗争，促进党委生活革命化
    领导成员思想革命化和党委生活革命化，是互相结合互相促进的。我们在抓领导成员的思想改造当中，同时抓了党委生活的改进，使党委真正成为部队团结和领导的核心。团结，是领导班子革命化的重要标志。在这方面，我们过去也存在着一些问题。两年多来，我们通过学习毛主席关于党的建设理论，在党委生活中，积极地开展了思想斗争，进一步加强了党委的团结，发挥了党委的集体领导作用。
    对人对己都要一分为二。在党委生活中，一定要有一分为二的观点。看问题比较全面一些，说话比较准确一些，一个领导班子才能比较容易地取得共同语言，才有可能互相尊重，搞好团结，积极共事。怎样在党委生活中运用一分为二？我们注意了三点：一是对优点和缺点、成绩和错误，要力求“分”得准确一些。对自己不能把优点分过了头，对别人不能把缺点分过了头。分过了头，就会把话说过头，把事办过头，造成隔阂。二是要采取积极的态度去“分”。对自己的缺点，分了之后要认真改，不能借口“老毛病”而自我原谅；对别人的缺点，分了之后要热情地帮，不能看“热闹”。这样有改、有帮，就能互相促进，共同提高。三是不能静止地“分”。对自己，老毛病改掉了，还要看到会出现新毛病，要经常地有分有改；对别人，要允许人家改正缺点，承认人家的进步，不能一碗清水看到底，一个框子框到头。我们深深体会到，在党委生活中，对人对己都坚持一分为二，既有利于自己进步，也有利于别人进步，更有利于集体的进步。
    以是对非，不以非对非。我们深深体会到，避免无原则的纠纷，开展有原则的斗争，是党委生活革命化的重要问题。这里，关键的问题是要做到以是对非，不以非对非。这方面我们有过教训，曾经发生过一些以片面对片面、以偏激对偏激的情况。后来，我们学习了毛主席关于批评与自我批评的指示和刘少奇同志的《论共产党员的修养》，通过总结正面和反面的经验，懂得了：一定要从团结的愿望出发，站在正确方面，不能你来一个不对，我就还你一个不对，以非对非。这是正确进行党内斗争的一个原则问题。有时，即使自己处在当事人的地位，而且受了委屈，也要做到以是对非，不从个人角度去作文章。其次，我们还体会到，在党委生活中要做到以是对非，还需要当书记的遇事冷静，识火候，不要当双方都在火头上的时候，去组织“针锋相对”的斗争，这样做，很难以明辨是非。有些问题，过晚地去解决固然不利，过急地去解决未必能成。时机选择好，先做好个别工作，问题就可以解决得顺利一些。
    在不整齐中求整齐。一个领导班子，十来个人，思想水平、斗争经验、工作作风都不一样，不可能是整齐的。过去我们不懂得这一点，总是埋怨班子不整齐，而不去主动地争取整齐。学习了《矛盾论》和《党委会的工作方法》，我们懂得了：不整齐是绝对的，是正常的。党委生活的重要内容之一，就是要在不整齐中求得相对的整齐，以充分发挥集体领导的作用。从此，我们有了主动争取整齐的自觉性。我们从几年来的实践中体会到，要想在不整齐中求得整齐，首先要承认不整齐，才不会怨天尤人，才能下定决心一起共事。有个同志才来时思想上有包袱，工作不大胆。我们没有歧视他，而是热情地欢迎他，鼓励他丢掉包袱，坚强起来。他很受感动，工作很积极，进步很快。党委要干什么，他能积极地跟上来。这样求得队伍的相对整齐，事情就好办了。其次，要象毛主席教导的那样，不怕意见分歧，充分地发扬民主，让大家把话说完。通过争论，明辨是非，找出真理，才会有真正的共同语言和统一的行动。三是不能把统一思想的工作完全寄托在会议上。特别是对于那些大的原则问题，比较复杂的问题，一定要通过个别商谈，作好疏通工作，力求在大家思想有准备，在意见比较接近的情况下，再召开会议。这样，会议才能少走弯路，少“顶牛”，尽快地统一认识，步调一致地开展工作。	  在实际工作中运用辩证法，推动领导作风革命化
    领导班子革命化的根本目的是做好领导工作，加强部队建设。过去我们团的领导作风，也存在不少问题：浮浅，被动，一般化，因而部队工作进步比较慢。我们在逐步加强领导成员思想革命化、党委生活革命化的过程中，同时强调了要进一步解决领导作风革命化的问题。要在实际工作中，以革命精神学习毛主席的革命辩证法，边学边革命，使领导工作上形而上学少一些，辩证法多一些，做好面对面的领导工作。
    既当领导又当标兵。过去我们工作成效不够好，问题在于只想到当领导，没有想到本身要当标兵，凡事不是自己先做出样子。毛主席历来教导我们，领导者的模范作用，是做好领导工作的重要条件。特别是我们团一级的领导，天天同群众见面，本身不能起示范带头作用，就很难很好地贯彻执行党的方针政策。这一点，我们过去认识不够，好些工作展不开，特别是在抓学习毛主席著作这个部队的根本建设问题上，前几年我们作了一些工作，但是效果不大。什么原因？当时我们不能认识。后来上级机关来检查工作，一下子给我们点破了，关键在于我们团的领导班子本身没有学在前头，带头学好。从那以后，我们下决心学了，给部队摆出了样子，全团就很快出现了学习热潮。
    既要具体抓，又要避免烦琐哲学。抓落实，就是要具体抓，抓具体。以前我们划不清具体与烦琐的界限，存在着两种偏向：要具体，就搞烦琐哲学；而反对烦琐哲学，就不去做具体工作。这样，在工作中该具体的不具体，不该具体的倒搞烦琐了。学了《矛盾论》，我们懂得了，所谓烦琐哲学，就是拉拉杂杂，琐碎地罗列现象，抓不住事物的本质，是绕圈子，叫人不得要领。而具体抓，决不是单单去抓现象，正是要求抓住事物的要害。这两者是根本不同的。真正解决问题的具体抓，绝不是烦琐哲学；搞烦琐哲学，并不能解决具体问题。有了这个认识之后，我们一方面注意不搞叫人不得要领的事。另一方面，在下连蹲点的过程中，注意了抓那些有意义的“小题目”，切实地为连队解决一批具体问题。通过解决这样一些具体问题，使我们进一步体会到：许多事情，孤立地看是小事，从全局来看，又是大事。所以，一定要认真地抓具体问题。在抓的过程中，只要抓住要害，方法对头，善于从点上入手，面上开花，就不会陷入事务主义，可以避免烦琐哲学。
    力求多有几分主动权。过去，我们的工作比较被动。一年忙到头，大都是在“堵口子”，思想上总感到压力很大，工作上伸展不开手足。通过学习毛主席关于争取主动权的论述，我们懂得了在工作中争取主动的重要性，认识到摆脱工作上的被动局面是可能的，并经常注意从被动中去争取主动。目前，我们工作上的被动情况固然还有，但总算多了几分主动权。这几分主动权是怎样争取来的呢？第一，狠抓根本。抓住根本，就有了基本的主动权。这几年我们一直抓住了学习毛主席著作这个根本，这样，工作也就展得开一些了，被动应付的情况就少了。抓住根本，有时即使出现了一些被动，也只是小被动，不是大被动，容易摆脱。第二，开动思想机器，学会抓事物的本质。抓住事物的本质，才能掌握解决具体问题的主动权。一九六三年，部队补充了一批贵州籍的新战士。当时不少连排干部反映这批战士“不好带”，管理教育工作一度发生了一些问题。问题的本质在那里，当时我们没有抓住，弄得很被动。后来经过调查研究，这才发现，原来基层干部对贵州籍战士的看法，用的是“地域分析”，而不是“阶级分析”。这就是问题的本质所在。抓住了这个本质问题，我们组织干部重新学习了毛主席关于阶级分析的方法，端正了认识，纠正了偏见，管理教育工作上的问题就解决了。第三，遇事多想几个主意。工作中只有一个主意，有时能打主动仗，有时就不能打主动仗，而把几种可能都估计到，多有几个主意，就能够比较稳妥地打主动仗。
