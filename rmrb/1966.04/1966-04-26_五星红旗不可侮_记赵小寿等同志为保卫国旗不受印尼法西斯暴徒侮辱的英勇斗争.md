    The Five-Starred Red Flag Must Not Be Insulted
    ——An Account of the Heroic Struggle of Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and Others to Protect the National Flag from Insult by Indonesian Fascist Thugs
    Zhao Xiaoshou and some comrades from our country's embassy in Indonesia recently returned to the motherland, where they received a warm welcome and cordial greetings from the people of the capital and the entire nation.
    The reporter wants to report to the people of the whole country about how the sons and daughters of the motherland, who grew up under the five-starred red flag, fought heroically with Indonesian fascist thugs to uphold the honor of the motherland and defend the solemn five-starred red flag.
    Our country and people are proud of their heroic actions. Our ancestors endured humiliation for generations, but today, in the era of Mao Zedong, the days of humiliation are gone forever. Our diplomats in Jakarta, fearless in the face of fascist violence, unafraid of sacrifice, and daring to fight, demonstrated the unshakeable heroic spirit and iron will of the great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. China cannot be insulted! The five-starred red flag cannot be insulted! What could be more dignified than the five-starred red flag that the martyrs exchanged for their blood? Zhao Xiaoshou and his comrades are worthy of being diplomatic fighters of the Mao Zedong era.

    (I)
    On the morning of April 15, demons danced wildly on Banteng Square in Jakarta. The Indonesian right-wing military regime, which had bloodily washed the archipelago nation, organized a gathering of thugs here and staged an anti-China farce. At 10:50 a.m., personnel from the Indonesian armed forces, fully armed, together with this group of thugs (some of whom were Chiang Kai-shek special agents), arrived in dozens of trucks in front of our country's embassy in Indonesia, located in the downtown area. They smashed the door madly and cursed shamelessly. Dozens of thugs and fully armed soldiers rushed in, climbed over the walls, and jumped into the embassy courtyard to destroy and commit violence.
    The bandits shouted wildly and first rushed to the flagpole on the embassy lawn, attempting to forcibly tear down our solemn national flag.
    The five-starred red flag, the five-starred red flag stained red with the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, the symbol of our great motherland and great people, is sacred and inviolable! To defend her is to defend the dignity of the motherland, to defend the dignity of the 650 million Chinese people, to defend the lofty revolutionary cause... For all this, the sons and daughters of New China, nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought, would rather have their heads cut off and their blood flow. It was at this critical moment that the eight comrades guarding the flag stood arm in arm, surrounding the flagpole. They were filled with righteous indignation, despised the bandits waving sticks and daggers, and shouted loudly: "Fascist thugs, get out!" The dignity of the People's Republic of China cannot be insulted! They confronted the thugs for half an hour, and the bandits did not dare to approach the national flag a step.
    The sinister purpose of this group of bandits was even more nakedly exposed. They used armored vehicles and trucks to crash open the embassy gate from outside the wall.
    More thugs poured in. They used wooden sticks, iron bars, and stones to hit the eight comrades guarding the flag, including Lu Zibo, the First Secretary of the embassy, and Shi Xinren, the Deputy Military Attaché. Zhao Xiaoshou and Hu Chaopin, and three other comrades guarding the building, immediately rushed out selflessly to support and join the flag guard. When a thug raised an iron bar to hit Comrade Hu Chaopin, the fearless Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, this 25-year-old probationary member of the Chinese Communist Party, stretched out his arms to protect Comrade Hu Chaopin. At this moment, a soldier wearing a helmet in the crowd of thugs aimed at Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou from a distance of less than ten meters and fired. The bullet penetrated his right chest, and Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou was seriously injured and fell in a pool of blood. Another fascist soldier aimed at Comrade Hu Chaopin again. Comrade Shi Xinren was quick and used his arm to deflect the gun. A bullet flew past Comrade Hu Chaopin. The comrades were even more outraged and, while rescuing Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, angrily condemned the murderer.
    At this time, more than a thousand thugs and fascist soldiers had invaded the embassy. This was a gang of unadulterated robbers and bandits. They tore down and tore up the national flag of the People's Republic of China, smashed the national emblem of the People's Republic of China, used submachine guns to shoot, and used iron bars and wooden sticks to smash the doors, windows, and furniture of all rooms except the embassy's backyard. They cut off the embassy's telephone lines, stole telephones, smashed and burned embassy houses, equipment, cars, documents, and supplies, and stole cars and other valuables, clothes, and a large amount of property. In short, they destroyed everything they could destroy and stole everything they could steal. They committed violence in the Chinese Embassy for three hours. As they left, they shamelessly shouted, "Long live the United States," and "We have completed Uncle Suharto's task of destroying the Chinese Embassy."
    When the thugs were about to leave, Malik, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of the Indonesian right-wing military regime, arrived in the embassy hall, surrounded by a group of fully armed soldiers and thugs. Yao Dengshan, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of our embassy in Indonesia, lodged the strongest protest on the spot with this person who had publicly incited the attack on the Chinese Embassy at the anti-China rally that day. Other Chinese diplomatic officials present pointed to Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, who was in a state of shock, and his blood-stained clothes and protested to Malik, saying: "We will denounce your fascist atrocities to the people of the world." Malik had no words to answer and retreated in embarrassment. The remaining thugs also rolled out of the embassy gate under the shouts of our embassy staff.
    The Chinese people cannot be insulted, and the five-starred red flag cannot be insulted. Just after the thugs slipped out of our embassy, the comrades of the embassy solemnly took out a brand-new national flag and came to the flagpole on the lawn. The steel rope on the flagpole had been cut off by the thugs, so our comrades bravely climbed the tall flagpole and hung the national flag at the top. The five-starred red flag looked even more solemn and beautiful, flying in the wind!
    In this sharp class struggle against the Indonesian fascist bandits, all the comrades of the embassy showed their infinite loyalty to the motherland, the people, and Chairman Mao, and showed the unyielding proletarian backbone spirit. These dozens of red hearts, loyal to the motherland and loyal to the people, thousands of miles away, were beating together with the hearts of the 650 million people of the motherland. They felt that together with the people of the motherland, they had infinite and enormous power.
    They were fully aware that the enemy's opposition to us only proves that we are correct; the more frantically the enemy opposes us, the more it proves that we are correct. The Indonesian right-wing military regime's robber behavior of trampling on the most basic norms of international law and internationally recognized diplomatic privileges has completely exposed its fascist face and also demonstrated its weakness and death throes. Our comrades despised the violence of the bandits. In the struggle, regardless of personal safety, they pressed close to the fascist soldiers carrying live ammunition and shouted loudly: "We are diplomats of the People's Republic of China!" "Your violence cannot scare us!" Their heroic spirit overwhelmed the arrogance of the fascist thugs.
    The care from the Party and the motherland, thousands of miles away, quickly reached the comrades. They were extremely excited, turned on the radio, listened to the voice of Beijing, and drew strength from it. Everyone said: "The people of the motherland care about us so much, how should we respond to the people of the motherland?" "We want to express our determination to the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the people of the whole country: We are always prepared to resolutely accept all possible tests; in order to safeguard the honor of the motherland, we would rather give our lives than lose face for the motherland!"
    This is the oath of our loyal, fearless revolutionary diplomatic warriors!

    (II)
    After Zhao Xiaoshou was injured, he was carried to the backyard of the embassy by his comrades. Blood kept flowing from the wound on his right chest, and his white shirt was almost completely stained red with blood. The comrades quickly brought cotton and gauze to bandage his wound. Zhao Xiaoshou slowly woke up. When he heard the shouts of the thugs outside, he endured the severe pain and said word by word to the comrade who was taking care of him: "Don't worry about me! I haven't completed my task well, go fight!"
    Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou's loyalty to the motherland and his proletarian backbone spirit inspired every comrade in the embassy. After Indonesian thugs attacked our consulate general and commercial counselor's office in Jakarta, he had said to his comrades: "Comrade Wang Jie is not afraid of hardship and not afraid of death, and is a role model for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way. We must be like him, do as Chairman Mao said, and we must always think of the people and the motherland in our hearts. If the Indonesian right-wing dares to infringe on us, I will stick to my post, resolutely fight, and not be afraid of sacrifice!"
    Because of excessive blood loss, Zhao Xiaoshou fainted again. Just after the thugs withdrew from the embassy, the comrades sent him to the hospital for emergency treatment. Zhao Xiaoshou did not know where he had arrived. He closed his eyes and was still talking in the hospital bed: "Thugs... get out, get out..." The comrade who was taking care of him by the bed told the comrades of the embassy what he said in his coma. Everyone controlled their emotions, and everyone was saying in their hearts: "Little Zhao, our good comrade!"
      "We must save Little Zhao as soon as possible!" After Zhao Xiaoshou was injured, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Yao Dengshan and the comrades of the embassy were doing everything they could do for Zhao Xiaoshou. Some comrades transfused their own blood into Zhao Xiaoshou's body.
    Zhao Xiaoshou was hospitalized from the 15th to the 21st. During the six days, the comrades of the embassy took turns caring for him day and night. Chargé d'Affaires ad interim Yao Dengshan and other comrades came to the hospital and conveyed the cordial greetings from the motherland to Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou. Zhao Xiaoshou said: "I have not completed the task assigned to me by the people of the motherland very well, I still have to persevere in the struggle!" Comrade Yao Dengshan said to him: "You have completed your task very well. You bravely defended the national flag and safeguarded the honor of the motherland. You are a good son of the people of the motherland!" The comrades also solemnly informed Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou that the superior party organization had approved his transfer to a full member of the Communist Party of China. In the days after this injury, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou felt that he had only done what the Chinese people should do. He endured the severe pain of the wound without crying. At this moment, as he listened to the comrades conveying the care of the Party and the motherland, he could not restrain the excitement in his heart and shed tears. He just said: "I want to thank the Party, thank Chairman Mao, thank the people of the motherland!"
    Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, the son of a poor peasant, was not even ten years old when New China was founded. He grew up under the red flag. In 1958, he joined the army. In the army, he listened to Chairman Mao's words, read Chairman Mao's books, and did things according to Chairman Mao's instructions. He was once a five-good soldier. Later, he was demobilized and transferred to work abroad. Zhao Xiaoshou is loyal to the motherland, heroic and tenacious, persevering in the struggle, and is worthy of being a strong revolutionary fighter.
    Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou has returned to the capital and returned to the embrace of the people of the motherland. The comrades cordially comforted him. He humbly said to the comrades: "All this is the teaching of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the people of the motherland have given us infinite strength!"
    Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou and the comrades of our country's embassy in Indonesia who defended the dignity of the motherland, the people of the motherland pay tribute to you! The people of the whole country are with you!
    Fly high, the five-starred red flag! The sons and daughters of New China armed with Mao Zedong Thought will forever and ever defend you!

    五星红旗不可侮
    ——记赵小寿等同志为保卫国旗不受印尼法西斯暴徒侮辱的英勇斗争
    赵小寿和我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的一些同志们，最近返回了祖国，他们受到了首都以及全国人民的热烈欢迎和亲切问候。
    记者要向全国人民报告，报告在五星红旗下成长的祖国的儿女们，他们是怎样为了维护祖国的荣誉，保卫庄严的五星红旗，同印度尼西亚法西斯暴徒进行英勇搏斗的。
    我们的祖国和人民，对他们的英雄行为引以为自豪。我们的先辈世世代代忍受过屈辱，可是今天，在毛泽东时代，受屈辱的日子一去不复返了。我国在雅加达的外交人员，在法西斯暴力面前临危不惧、不怕牺牲、敢于斗争，表现了毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民不可摇撼的英雄气概和钢铁意志。中国不可侮！五星红旗不可侮！有什么能比先烈们用鲜血换来的五星红旗更为尊严的呢？赵小寿他们，不愧为毛泽东时代的外交战士。	（一）
    四月十五日上午，雅加达雄牛广场群魔乱舞，血洗了千岛之国的印度尼西亚右派军人政权，在这里组织暴徒集会，演出了一场反华丑剧。十时五十分，全副武装的印度尼西亚武装部队人员伙同这群暴徒（其中有一些是蒋帮特务分子）分乘几十辆卡车，来到位于闹市区的我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆门前。他们疯狂地砸门，无耻地辱骂。几十个暴徒和全副武装的军人，乱冲乱闯，翻越围墙，跳进使馆院内破坏、行凶。
    匪徒们狂叫着，首先涌向使馆草坪上的旗杆，企图用暴力扯下我们庄严的国旗。
    五星红旗，无数革命先烈的鲜血染红的五星红旗，我们伟大祖国和伟大人民的象征，神圣不可侵犯！维护她，就是维护祖国的尊严，就是维护六亿五千万中国人民的尊严，就是维护崇高的革命事业，……为了这一切，用毛泽东思想哺育成长的新中国的儿女们，头可断，血可流。就是在这个紧急的时刻，护旗的八位同志臂挽着臂，围住旗杆。他们正义凛然，蔑视挥舞棒棍和匕首的匪徒，大声怒斥：“法西斯暴徒，滚出去！”中华人民共和国的尊严不可侮！他们同暴徒们对峙了半个小时，匪徒们不敢逼近国旗一步。
    这帮匪徒的阴险目的，更加赤裸裸地暴露出来了。他们在墙外用装甲车和卡车，撞开了使馆大门。
    更多的暴徒涌进来了，他们用木棒、铁棍和石头朝着护旗的使馆一等秘书吕子波、副武官时心仁等八位同志打来。护卫大楼的赵小寿、胡朝品等五位同志立即奋不顾身冲出来支援，参加护旗。一个暴徒举起铁棍正要打胡朝品同志的时候，大无畏的赵小寿同志，这位二十五岁的中国共产党预备党员，伸开两臂护住胡朝品同志，这时，暴徒群中的一个头戴钢盔的军人，在不到十米的距离举枪瞄准赵小寿同志射击，子弹穿进他的右胸，赵小寿同志重伤，倒在血泊中。另一个法西斯军人又朝着胡朝品同志瞄准，时心仁同志眼快，用手臂拨开枪，一颗子弹从胡朝品同志旁边飞了过去。同志们更加怒不可遏，一面抢救赵小寿同志，一面愤怒地斥责杀人凶手。
    这时，已经有一千多暴徒和法西斯军人侵入使馆。这是一帮不折不扣的强盗、匪徒。他们扯下并撕毁了中华人民共和国国旗，砸毁了中华人民共和国国徽，他们用冲锋枪射击，他们用铁棒、木棍捣毁了除使馆后院以外的所有房间的门窗和家具，他们割断了使馆电话线、抢走了电话机，他们砸毁和烧毁了大使馆的房屋、设备、汽车、文件和用品，他们抢走了汽车及其他贵重物品、衣服和大量财物。总之，他们捣毁了能捣毁的一切，抢走了能抢走的一切。他们在中国大使馆行凶达三小时之久。他们在临走时还恬不知耻地大叫“美国万岁”，“我们完成了苏哈托伯伯叫我们捣毁中国大使馆的任务”。
    当暴徒们快要离开的时候，印度尼西亚右派军人政权的副总理兼外交部长马利克，由一群全副武装的军人和暴徒簇拥着，来到了使馆大厅。我驻印度尼西亚大使馆临时代办姚登山当场向这个在当天反华集会上公开煽动袭击中国大使馆的人提出最强烈的抗议。在场的其他中国外交官员指着处于休克状况的赵小寿同志和血衣向马利克抗议说：“我们要向全世界人民控诉你们的法西斯暴行。”马利克无词可对，狼狈地退走了。剩下的暴徒也在我使馆人员的喝斥之下，滚出了使馆的大门。
    中国人民不可侮，五星红旗不可侮。就在暴徒们溜出我使馆以后，使馆的同志们庄严地拿出一面崭新的国旗，来到草坪上的旗杆前面。旗杆上的钢绳已被暴徒砍断，我们的同志便勇敢地攀上高高的旗杆，把国旗悬挂在顶端。五星红旗更加显得庄严美丽，迎风飘扬！
    在同印度尼西亚法西斯匪徒进行的这场尖锐的阶级斗争中，使馆全体同志都表现了对祖国对人民对毛主席的无限忠诚，都表现了威武不屈的无产阶级硬骨头精神。这万里之外几十颗忠于祖国、忠于人民的红心，在和祖国六亿五千万人民的心一起跳动，他们觉得和祖国人民在一起，自己有着无穷的巨大的力量。
    他们完全清楚，敌人反对我们，正说明我们正确；敌人愈是疯狂反对我们，就愈说明我们正确。印度尼西亚右派军人政权践踏国际法起码准则和国际公认的外交人员特权的强盗行为，彻底暴露了它的法西斯面目，也表现了它的虚弱和垂死挣扎。我们的同志蔑视匪徒的暴力。他们在斗争中，不顾个人安危，紧逼着那些荷枪实弹的法西斯军人，大声喝道：“我们是中华人民共和国的外交人员！”“你们的暴力吓不倒我们！”他们气贯长虹，压倒了法西斯暴徒的猖狂气焰。
    来自万里之外的党和祖国的关怀，很快传到了同志们中间。他们激动异常，打开收音机，倾听北京的声音，从中汲取力量。大家谈道：“祖国人民这样关怀我们，我们要怎样回答祖国人民呢？”“我们要向党中央、毛主席和全国人民表决心：我们时刻准备着，坚决接受可能到来的一切考验；为了维护祖国的荣誉，我们宁可付出自己的生命，也决不给祖国丢脸！”
    这就是我们赤胆忠心、无所畏惧的革命外交战士的誓言！	（二）
    赵小寿受伤以后，被同志们抬到大使馆后院，鲜血不住地从他右胸的伤口流了出来，身上的白衫几乎全被鲜血染红了。同志们赶快拿来棉花和纱布，给他把伤口包扎好。赵小寿慢慢地醒了过来。当他听到外面暴徒的喊声时，忍着剧痛对照看他的同志一字一句地说：“不要管我！我没有完成好任务，你们去斗争！”
    赵小寿同志对祖国的忠心，他的无产阶级硬骨头精神，激励着使馆的每一个同志。在印度尼西亚暴徒袭击我国雅加达总领事馆和商务参赞处以后，他就曾向同志们说：“王杰同志一不怕苦，二不怕死，是活学活用毛主席著作的榜样。我们要象他一样，照着毛主席的话去做，我们心里要永远想着人民，想着祖国。印度尼西亚右派胆敢侵犯我们，我就要坚守岗位，坚决斗争，不怕牺牲！”
    因为流血过多，赵小寿又昏迷过去了。就在暴徒撤离使馆以后，同志们把他送到医院急救。赵小寿不知他到了那里，他闭着眼，还在病床上说着话：“暴徒……滚，滚开……”。在病床旁照料的同志，把他在昏迷中说的话告诉使馆的同志们，大家控制着自己的感情，每一个人的心里都在说着一句话：“小赵，我们的好同志！”
      “我们一定要尽快把小赵救过来！”在赵小寿负伤以后，姚登山临时代办和使馆同志，每个人都在为赵小寿做着自己能够做到的一切事情，有些同志把自己的血，输到赵小寿的身体里。
    赵小寿从十五日入院，二十一日出院，在六天的时间里，使馆同志日日夜夜，轮流在一旁看护。姚登山临时代办和其他同志，来到医院，把来自祖国的亲切慰问，传达给赵小寿同志，赵小寿说：“我没有很好完成祖国人民交给我的任务，我还要坚持斗争！”姚登山同志向他说：“你的任务完成得很好，你英勇保卫国旗，维护祖国荣誉。你是祖国人民的好儿子！”同志们还庄严地通知赵小寿同志，上级党组织已经批准他转为中国共产党正式党员。在这次负伤以后的日子里，赵小寿同志觉得自己只是做了中国人民应该做的事情。他忍着伤口的剧痛，没有哭过一声。此刻，他倾听着同志们转达的党和祖国的关怀，却无法抑制内心的激动，流出了热泪。他只是说着：“我要感谢党，感谢毛主席，感谢祖国人民！”
    赵小寿同志，一个贫农的儿子，新中国成立时，他还不到十岁。他在红旗下成长，一九五八年参军。在部队，他听毛主席的话，读毛主席的书，照毛主席的指示办事，曾是五好战士。以后复员转业，走上国外工作的岗位。赵小寿忠于祖国，英勇顽强，坚持斗争，不愧是一个坚强的革命战士。
    赵小寿同志回到了首都，回到了祖国人民的怀抱，同志们亲切地慰问他，他谦虚地向同志们说：“这一切都是党和毛主席的教导，是祖国人民给了我们无限的力量！”
    赵小寿同志和保卫祖国尊严的我国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的同志们，祖国人民向你们致敬！全国人民和你们在一起！
    高高飘扬吧，五星红旗！用毛泽东思想武装起来的新中国的儿女，永远永远把你维护！
