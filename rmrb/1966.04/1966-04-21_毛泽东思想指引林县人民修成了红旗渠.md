    Mao Zedong Thought Guides Linxian People to Build the Red Flag Canal
    Henan's Linxian Holds Grand Rally to Warmly Celebrate the Completion and Water Diversion of the Red Flag Canal
    (Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 20th) The people of Linxian County, Henan Province, held a grand rally today to warmly celebrate the completion and water diversion of the Red Flag Canal.
    Before dawn, many commune members, carrying colorful flags, happily headed towards several gathering locations, including Hongying Confluence, Taoyuan Aqueduct Bridge, Duofeng Aqueduct, and Shuguang Cave. A total of over ten thousand people participated in the rally.
    Wen Minsheng, Second Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Henan Province, Zhao Wenfu, Yang Weiping, and other responsible comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, as well as responsible comrades from various prefectural and county party committees across the province, responsible comrades from the Jin Southeast Prefectural Party Committee and Administrative Office and Ping Shun County Party Committee of Shanxi Province, also participated in the celebration.
    The main venue was set at Hongying Confluence in Hejian Commune. Couplets were pasted on both sides of the venue: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fight against heaven and earth to rearrange the rivers and mountains of Linxian.
    Yang Gui, Deputy Secretary of the Anyang Prefectural Party Committee and concurrently Secretary of the Linxian County Party Committee, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary spirit of the Linxian people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, in fighting against heaven and earth at the celebration rally.
    Wen Minsheng, Second Secretary of the Henan Provincial Party Committee and Governor of Henan Province, and representatives from the Jin Southeast Prefectural Party Committee and the Ping Shun County Party Committee of Shanxi Province, extended warm congratulations to the people of Linxian at the rally. Yang Shuangxi, a labor model representative for the construction of the Red Flag Canal project, also spoke at the rally.
    At the celebration, the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee presented the people of Linxian with a banner and distributed a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to each labor model who participated in the construction of the Red Flag Canal. The Anyang Prefectural Party Committee and the Anyang Administrative Office issued certificates of merit to the people of Linxian. The Linxian County Party Committee and the County People's Committee awarded prizes to thirty-three special model units and forty-two special labor models for the construction of the Red Flag Canal.
    At 12:20, the ribbon was cut and the water was released. At the Hongying Confluence of the main canal, the Duofeng Aqueduct of the second main canal, and the Shuguang Cave of the third main canal, water was released simultaneously. The vast number of commune members, seeing the Zhang River water flowing rapidly along the canal, cheered and rejoiced, with applause, gongs, drums, firecrackers, and the sound of rushing water intertwining together. Some jumped up with joy; others waved colorful flags, shouting: Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the Communist Party! An old lady, seeing the Zhang River water flowing in, said with tears in her eyes: Zhang River water! Zhang River water! Twenty years ago, drought forced me to flee famine. When I passed the Zhang River, I drank a few mouthfuls of you. I never thought you would obediently flow here today. When the Zhang River water flowed to Donggang, Heshun, Hengshui, Dongyao, Caisang and other communes, which have always been severely short of water, the commune members said with full confidence that with water, increased production would be even more guaranteed.
    The magnificent project of the people of Linxian, Henan Province—"Diverting the Zhang River into Lin"—the Red Flag Canal, has been completed and the water has been released along its entire length. This is a great achievement on the water conservancy construction front, achieved by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the Party's general line for building socialism, fully leveraging the collective strength of the people's communes, relying on the infinite wisdom of the broad masses of the people, and using the spirit of the Foolish Old Man with one hammer and one chisel, after more than six years of arduous struggle.
    Realizing Long-Held Aspirations in the Socialist Era
    The head of the Red Flag Canal is located at Houbiduan in Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province. The people of Linxian intercepted the Zhang River here, letting it flow into Linxian according to human will along the Red Flag Canal. The main canal of the Red Flag Canal, which is eight meters wide at the bottom and has a flow rate of twenty-five cubic meters per second, is one hundred and forty li long. It flies across the waist of the Taihang Mountains and reaches Fentou Ridge in the north of Linxian. Then there are three branch canals: the first branch canal joins the original Hero Canal to the south; the second branch canal points directly southeast to the border of Anyang County; the third branch canal goes to the northeast, connected by branch canals to reach Shexian County in Hebei Province. There are forty-two branch canals on the three main canals. It takes three days and three nights for the Zhang River water to travel more than three hundred li from the head of the canal to the farthest village in Linxian.
    Diverting the Zhang River to Linxian is a long-held aspiration of the people throughout the county.
    Of the more than five hundred villages in Linxian, more than three hundred have no water source. In these places, not to mention using water to irrigate farmland, even people and livestock have to fetch water from several or even dozens of li away. The county uses more than three million labor days a year to fetch water from afar. Some poor and lower-middle peasants with less labor power have to eat fried noodles and gnaw on dry food because they are too busy to fetch water. Life is even harder in drought years. Before liberation, water shortages caused many tragedies of families being broken up.
    The cadres working in Linxian are concerned about the people's worries. From the War of Resistance Against Japan to 1959, they led the people to build the Anti-Japanese Canal; dug thousands of dry wells and dry ponds to store rainwater; and built more than thirty small and medium-sized reservoirs and the Hero Canal, Qinan Canal, Qibei Canal, and so on. The Linxian County Party Committee envisioned that these water conservancy projects would accumulate a large amount of rainwater to solve the problems of drinking water and irrigation. However, a severe drought in 1959 meant there was no water to store, and the problems of water for people's lives and production remained unresolved. The Linxian County Party Committee summarized the experiences and lessons of these years and concluded that to fundamentally solve the water problem, the Zhang River water must be diverted to Linxian. The county party committee's vision received the wholehearted support of the broad masses of the people, who agreed to open a canal along the Taihang Mountains to divert the Zhang River into Linxian and named the canal "Red Flag Canal."
    Now, the people's wishes have been realized. The completion and water diversion of the Red Flag Canal is connecting the original Hero Canal, Anti-Japanese Canal, and many other canals, as well as more than thirty small and medium-sized reservoirs and thousands of dry ponds and dry wells, forming a water conservancy network that can both store and irrigate. More than 400,000 people in eleven communes across the county, who have suffered the hardship of "eating distant water" for generations, have ended their bitter lives. The production landscape of Linxian is undergoing significant changes. Currently, the Red Flag Canal water has irrigated 330,000 mu of land. To achieve the designed irrigation area of 600,000 mu, the people of Linxian are carrying forward the spirit of continuous revolution and are accelerating the construction of supporting projects such as branch, bucket, and hair canals.
    Building Canals for the Revolution
    The Red Flag Canal began construction in February 1960. The tenacious drive to build canals for the revolution and the heroic spirit of despising difficulties ran through the entire construction process.
    When the project first started, construction was to be carried out in the territory of Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province. At that time, tens of thousands of young male and female commune members, carrying Chairman Mao's books, carrying dry food and luggage, and carrying iron hammers and large picks, rushed to the construction site more than a hundred li away. The villages near the construction site were small and there were few civilian houses, so many migrant workers lived in straw sheds and cave dwellings built along the mountain canal, and some lived in stone crevices. In the autumn, it rained continuously, and the straw sheds and tents leaked rain. The migrant workers rolled up their bedding and slept back-to-back under the rain cloth. At that time, the only road along the canal line was a winding mountain path next to the Taihang Mountains, and transportation was quite inconvenient. Sometimes food and vegetables could not be transported, but the migrant workers did not complain and continued to construct the canal.
    The most difficult time was 1961. Due to the severe drought in 1960, the county suffered a poor harvest, and the lives of the hundreds of young people who remained on the canal construction site to continue construction in 1961 were quite difficult. However, they were encouraged by the revolutionary spirit of the Red Army's 25,000-li Long March and insisted on building canals for the revolution on the construction site. At night, they read Chairman Mao's books by the light of the kerosene lamp in the cave dwelling and studied the heroic deeds of Huang Jiguang and Dong Cunrui. They went up the mountain early in the morning and evening to collect wild vegetables and mixed them with the food sent by the commune; during the day, they straightened their backs, swung hammers weighing more than ten pounds, drilled steel, blasted rocks, and opened mountain caves.
    During the construction of the Red Flag Canal, many cadres and commune members from communes and production brigades were away from their hometowns for a long time, fighting on the construction site year after year. These people only had one belief: for the revolution, for the benefit of the people of the entire county, they would not hesitate to go through all kinds of hardships. The Dongyao Commune in the southeast of the county seat is the farthest from the head of the Red Flag Canal and benefits from the canal water the latest, but the commune members were an active "expeditionary force" participating in the canal construction. For a period of time, they were transferred to the second branch canal to build the canal, while Dongyao benefited from the water of the first branch canal. Some people asked them: "The water from the second branch canal cannot irrigate the land in Dongyao, so what are you doing in vain?" The migrant workers in Dongyao said: "As long as the Zhang River water can be diverted to Linxian, even if it irrigates the land in other communes first, Linxian will still produce more grain for the country, right?" Such style as that of Dongyao was also the general style on the Red Flag Canal construction site. Many migrant workers forgot their families for the sake of the public and forgot their private interests for the sake of the public. Wei Duanyang, an old stonemason over fifty years old in Heshun Commune, has been away from home for several years working on water conservancy. His family had many children and weak labor power, and his wife asked him: "No one is planting the private plot, what should we do?" Wei Duanyang said: "If the Red Flag Canal water doesn't come over, the large fields in the county cannot produce more grain. What's the use of just planting our small private plot?" Wang Xuebao, the deputy captain of a production team in Hengshui Commune, had not been home for two years. His wife sent more than ten letters, saying: "There are many people in the family, few houses, and there is no place to put the grain. Come back and build a house!" Wang Xuebao said: "How can I build my own house first if the Happiness Canal for the people of the whole county has not been built?" Many commune members and production team members had completed the canal construction tasks they were assigned based on the area of benefit in advance, but they did not go home and volunteered to support other teams. They said: "If a section of the Red Flag Canal is not built, the water cannot flow through it. Everyone must complete the task and bring the water home together."
    "Even Iron Mountains Must Be Drilled Through!"
    On the total length of 343 li of the Red Flag Canal's main canal and three branch canals, the heroic people of Linxian cut off 51 precipices as high as more than 200 meters, opened 59 mountain caves with a total length of nearly 18 li, and built 59 aqueducts with a total length of more than 5 li. These projects were very difficult and complex, but they were all taken down by the heroic people with tenacious revolutionary will.
    When opening the 616-meter-long "Youth Cave" on the main canal, the migrant workers hammered steel drills into the quartzite rock, which sparked and only showed white dots. They just couldn't drill in. A wind drill was borrowed from Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory, but using this wind drill to drill blast holes either curled the head or broke the tip. Only three centimeters were drilled, and forty-five drill bits were destroyed. All the drill bits were used up, and the hard stone could not be drilled. At this time, more than 300 young men and women fighting here boldly proposed in the face of the hard stone mountain: "No matter how hard the stone is, it can't be harder than our determination. Even iron mountains must be drilled through." They continued to use hand drills, which numbed their hands and sore arms, but the work efficiency became higher day by day, and the cave became deeper day by day. After a year and five months of hard work, this cave was finally opened.
    The Shuguang Cave, which is eight li long on the third branch canal, was opened under a stone ridge. Construction here encountered many difficulties such as smoke exhaust, drainage, and cave-ins. In order to overcome the difficulties, the migrant workers dug a total of thirty-four vertical shafts, the deepest of which was 62 meters and the shallowest was more than 20 meters. Water seeped into the cave, and they used buckets and other tools to lift it out; the top of the cave collapsed, and they used wood to support it and lined it with material stone; the smoke from the blasting could not be discharged, so they went down into the cave and fanned it out with their clothes.
    When building the 24-meter-high Taoyuan Aqueduct Bridge on the first branch canal, 3,000 pieces of wood were needed for scaffolding, but the general headquarters could only solve 1,000 pieces. At this time, the migrant workers constructing here learned from the folk method of building roof beams and designed a simple arch frame method to overcome the shortage of wood. The 413-meter-long and 4-meter-wide large aqueduct on the second branch canal is entirely built of material stones, and some people say that it is a huge "handicraft" of the Red Flag Canal.
    Carry Forward the Revolutionary Spirit of Self-Reliance
    The Red Flag Canal was built by the people of Linxian relying on the collective economic strength of the people's communes and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. The total funds used for the construction of the main canal and three branch canals were more than 42.36 million yuan, of which 79.5 percent was raised by the county, communes, brigades, and production teams themselves.
    When this canal project started, it was during a period of serious natural disasters in our country. At this time, the people of Linxian did not reach out to the state for investment or materials, but carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and relied on collective strength to plan themselves. They were always careful in their calculations and treated small money as a "grindstone" when using their limited funds in the construction process. They did not spend a penny on non-productive expenses; they resolutely did not buy what they could make themselves; and they calculated and scrutinized what they had to spend. In order to save money, the artisans on the construction site organized themselves and set up explosives processing plants, woodworking plants, blacksmith shops, lime kilns, woodworking repair teams, and basket weaving groups. They created a money-saving "open kiln lime burning" method, burning nearly 300 million jin of lime, saving more than half of the funds compared to buying ready-made ones; more than half of the explosives used for canal construction were also made by themselves, and the funds for buying one jin of explosives could make ten jin of explosives. They also wove more than 21,000 carrying baskets themselves, spun more than 38,000 jin of hemp rope, and used waste wood to make more than 2,000 small carts; hand hammers, large hammers, and other tools were all made by the construction site, saving a total of more than 2 million yuan.
    The people of Linxian did not have an engineer or a college student to build the Red Flag Canal. The technical strength was also solved by self-reliance - mainly relying on local old craftsmen and a few technicians who graduated from secondary vocational schools. In the construction process, the old stonemason Lu Yin became an outstanding peasant engineer. Based on practical experience, he proposed modifying the design of the Jiajiatun Aqueduct, saving the state more than 100,000 yuan in construction funds and improving the quality; Li Tiande, a communications worker in the agency, has become a water conservancy technician who can both survey and design; the ordinary peasant Chang Genhu has become a famous mountain blasting expert. Guo Jinliang, a poor peasant-born drummer, learned the stonemasonry skills that everyone admired. These people are the backbone of the construction of the Red Flag Canal. On the Red Flag Canal, more than 30,000 ordinary peasants became skilled stonemasons, and more than 200 people learned surveying. They have cultivated a group of both red and expert technical talents for the further construction of mountainous areas in the future.
    Touching Communist Style
    The Red Flag Canal was built across provincial boundaries and county boundaries. It embodies the communist style of collective farmers in the era of people's communes. The Red Flag Canal has 40 li of canal line passing through the Taihang Mountains in Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, starting from Houbiduan. The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the Ping Shun County Party Committee resolutely changed the plan to build two hydropower stations; the commune members of the two communes, Shicheng and Wangjiazhuang in Ping Shun County, gave up nearly 1,000 mu of cultivated land, moved ancestral graves, and cut down a large number of trees to let the people of Linxian build the canal. Kong Dongxin, an old poor peasant in Shicheng Brigade, said: "We farmers are one family in the world. We can't watch the class brothers in Linxian suffer from drought and live a hard life. Our Ping Shun County can destroy hundreds of mu of land to save hundreds of thousands of mu of land in Linxian. This is a good move to discard the pawn to protect the chariot." Wang Lun of Wangjiazhuang Brigade said: "Trees can be replanted if they are destroyed. It is a small matter for us to eat less pepper and fruit. It is a big matter for tens of thousands of people in Linxian to have water to drink!" When the Linxian canal-building army came to Ping Shun County, many commune members in the two communes of Shicheng and Wangjiazhuang gave up their good houses for the migrant workers to live in; some put their blankets on the migrant workers' beds; and some used white flour and eggs prepared by their families for the festival to comfort the sick migrant workers. This communist style of the people of Shanxi was widely praised by the people of Linxian and also inspired their fighting spirit, adding spiritual strength to their victory over difficulties and the construction of the Red Flag Canal.

    The Red Flag Canal created by the heroic people of Linxian winds around the towering and precipitous waist of the Taihang Mountains and passes through more than 50 precipices that are more than 200 meters high, making the project very difficult.
    With their indomitable revolutionary spirit, the people of Linxian have drilled through one mountain after another, allowing the Red Flag Canal to pass through the caves. These commune members are opening the Shuguang Cave canal project, which is as long as eight hua li.
    The Red Flag Canal has been built, and the long-cherished wish of the people of Linxian for generations has finally been realized. These old poor peasants came to the construction site with joy to visit the completed Red Flag Canal.
    The completion of the Red Flag Canal has changed the face of Linxian. Baijiazhuang, which has been suffering from drought for thousands of years, has now become a Jiangnan water town.

    毛泽东思想指引林县人民修成了红旗渠	河南林县盛大集会热烈庆祝红旗渠竣工通水
    据新华社郑州二十日电　河南省林县人民今天举行盛大集会，热烈庆祝红旗渠竣工通水。
    天还没亮，许多公社社员就扛着彩旗，喜气洋洋向红英汇流、桃园渡桥、夺丰渡槽、曙光洞等几处集会地点进发。参加集会的共有十几万人。
    中共河南省委第二书记、河南省省长文敏生，省委书记处书记赵文甫、杨蔚屏等省委负责人，以及全省各地委、县委的负责人，山西省晋东南地委、晋东南专署和平顺县委负责人，也参加了庆祝大会。
    中心会场设在合涧公社红英汇流的地方。会场两旁贴着对联：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战天斗地重新安排林县河山。
    中共安阳地委副书记兼林县县委书记杨贵，在庆祝大会上热情地赞扬了用毛泽东思想武装起来的林县人民战天斗地的革命精神。
    中共河南省委第二书记、河南省省长文敏生，和山西省晋东南地委、平顺县委代表，在大会上向林县人民致以热烈的祝贺。修建红旗渠工程的劳动模范代表杨双喜，也在会上讲了话。
    在庆祝会上，中共河南省委和省人民委员会授给林县人民一面锦旗，发给修建红旗渠的劳动模范每人一套《毛泽东选集》。中共安阳地委和安阳专署向林县人民发了奖状。中共林县县委和县人民委员会向修建红旗渠的三十三个特等模范单位、四十二个特等劳动模范发了奖。
    十二点二十分钟剪彩放水。一干渠的红英汇流处，二干渠的夺丰渡槽，三干渠的曙光洞，都同时放了水。广大社员见漳河水顺着渠道滚滚流来，欢腾雀跃，掌声、锣鼓声、鞭炮声和哗哗的流水声交织在一起。有的欢乐地蹦了起来；有的挥舞彩旗，高喊：毛主席万岁！共产党万岁！一个老大娘见到漳河水流来，含着泪说：漳河水啊！漳河水！二十年前，干旱逼着我逃荒，路过漳河时，喝了你几口，没想到你今天乖乖地流来了。漳河水流到一向缺水严重的东岗、河顺、横水、东姚、采桑等公社时，社员们信心百倍地说，有了水，增产就更有保证了。
    河南省林县人民开山导河的雄伟工程——“引漳入林”的红旗渠全线完工放水了。这是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线，充分发挥人民公社的集体力量，依靠广大人民的无穷智慧，以一锤一錾的愚公精神，经过六年多的艰苦奋战，在水利建设战线上所取得的一个伟大成果。	在社会主义时代实现了多年的愿望
    红旗渠渠首在山西省平顺县的侯壁断下。林县人民在这里把漳河水拦腰截断，让它按照人的意志，顺着红旗渠流入林县。底宽八米，过水量二十五秒立方的红旗渠总干渠，全长一百四十里，它在太行山腰横空飞越，到达林县北部的坟头岭。接着的是三条干渠：一干渠向南同原有的英雄渠汇合；二干渠朝东南直指安阳县边境；向东北去的三干渠，由支渠接连、达到河北省涉县。三条干渠上有四十二条支渠。漳河水从渠首流到林县最远的一个村庄途经三百多里，需三天三夜时间。
    把漳河引到林县，是全县人民多年来的愿望。
    林县五百多个村庄中，有三百多个没有水源。这些地方不要说是用水灌溉农田，就是人畜用水，也要翻山越岭，到几里甚至几十里以外去担。全县每年到远处挑水就用三百多万个劳动日。一些劳力少的贫下中农，下地干活，就顾不得担水，有时只能吃炒面，啃干粮。在干旱年月日子更苦。解放前，缺水造成了不少妻离子散的悲剧。
    在林县工作的干部，忧人民之所忧。从抗日战争时期开始，到一九五九年，他们领导人民先后修了抗日渠；挖了成千上万个蓄存雨水的旱井、旱池；修了三十多座中小型水库和英雄渠、淇南渠、淇北渠等。林县县委设想，凭着这些水利工程把雨水大量蓄积起来解决吃水、浇地等问题。可是一九五九年的一次大旱，无水可蓄，群众生活和生产用水的问题仍然解决不了。林县县委总结了这些年来的经验教训，得出了结论，要从根本上解决水的问题，必须把漳河水引到林县。县委的设想，得到了广大群众的衷心支持，群众同意沿太行山开渠，引漳入林，并把渠道命名为“红旗渠”。
    如今，群众的愿望实现了。红旗渠的竣工通水，正在把原有英雄渠、抗日渠等许多渠道，和三十多个中小型水库以及成千上万的旱池、旱井全都串连起来，形成一个能蓄能灌的水利网。全县有十一个公社的四十多万人民，祖祖辈辈“吃远水”的苦日子从此结束。林县的生产面貌正在发生显著变化。目前红旗渠水已灌溉三十三万亩土地。为了实现设计灌溉面积六十万亩的要求，林县人民发扬不断革命精神，正在加紧进行支、斗、毛渠等配套工程建设。		为革命修渠
    红旗渠是在一九六○年二月动工兴建的。为革命修渠的顽强干劲，藐视困难的英雄气概，始终贯穿在整个施工过程中。
    工程刚开始的时候，要在山西平顺县境内施工。当时几万名男女青年社员组成的修渠大军，带着毛主席的书，背着干粮和行李，扛着铁锤和大镐，奔赴百里以外的施工工地。工地附近村庄小，民房少，住不下，很多民工便靠山沿渠搭草棚、挖窑洞，住了下来，有的就住在石缝里。秋天阴雨连绵，草棚、帐篷漏雨，民工们卷起铺盖，大家背靠背的顶着雨布睡。那时，沿渠线的道路，只有太行山旁一条羊肠小道，运输相当不便，有时运不来粮食、蔬菜，民工们也不埋怨，照样施工。
    最艰难的是一九六一年。由于一九六○年大旱，全县粮食歉收，一九六一年留在渠道工地上继续施工的几百名青年，生活相当艰苦。但是，他们为红军两万五千里长征的革命精神所鼓舞，坚持在工地上为革命修渠。晚上映着窑洞的煤油灯光，读毛主席的书，学习黄继光、董存瑞的英雄事迹。早起傍晚上山去采集野菜，掺上公社送来的粮食吃；白天就挺起腰杆，抡起十几磅重的大锤打钎，爆破岩石，开凿山洞。
    在红旗渠施工过程中，有许多公社、生产大队的干部和社员，一直远离家乡，长年在工地上战斗。这些人只有一个信念：为了革命，为了全县人民的利益，就是历尽千辛万苦，也在所不辞。在县城东南的东姚公社，距离红旗渠渠首最远，受渠水灌溉效益最迟，但是，这个公社的社员却是一支积极参加修渠的“远征军”。有段时期，他们被调到二干渠上修渠，而东姚受灌溉效益的是一干渠的水。有人问他们：“二干渠的水浇不到东姚的地，你们白费那个劲干什么？”东姚的民工说：“只要能把漳河水引到林县，即使先浇其他公社的地，咱林县不也是多为国家打粮食吗？”象东姚这样风格也是红旗渠工地上的普遍风格。许多民工都公而忘家、公而忘私。河顺公社五十多岁的老石匠魏端阳，几年来一直离家在水利上干。他家孩子多、劳力弱，他老伴问他：“自留地没人种，咋办？”魏端阳说：“红旗渠水不过来，全县大田不能多打粮，光种咱小片自留地，顶啥用？”横水公社有个生产队副队长王雪保，二年没回家。他爱人捎十几次信来，说：“家里人多，房少，粮食没处放。你回来盖房子吧！”王雪保说：“全县人民的幸福渠没修好，咋能先盖自己的房？”许多公社、生产队社员，按受益面积所承担的修渠任务，早提前完成了，也不回家，又自动去支援别的队。他们说：“红旗渠如果有一段没有修通，水也流不过来，一定要大家都完成任务，共同带水回家。”		“就是铁山也要钻个窟窿！”
    在红旗渠全长三百四十三里的总干渠和三条干渠上，英雄的林县人民，斩断了五十一座高达二百多米以上的悬崖峭壁，开凿了总长近十八里五十九个山洞，修建了总长五里多的五十九座渡槽。这些工程都是非常艰巨复杂的，但是，他们都被英雄的人民，以顽强的革命意志拿下来了。
    在总干渠上开凿长达六百一十六米的“青年洞”的时候，民工们把钢钻打在石英岩上，直冒火星，光见白点，就是凿不进去。从洛阳矿山机械厂借来了一部风钻，用这部风钻打炮眼，不是卷了头，就是摧了尖，只钻了三厘米，就毁了四十五个钻头。所有的钻头都用完了，钻不动坚硬的石头。这时，战斗在这里的三百多名男女青年，在坚硬的石山面前豪迈地提出：“石头再硬，也硬不过我们的决心，就是铁山也要钻个窟窿。”他们一直坚持用手打钎，震得双手麻木，胳膊酸痛，而工效一天比一天高，洞一日比一日深。经过一年零五个月的苦战，这条山洞终于打通了。
    三干渠上长达八华里的曙光洞，是从一条石岭下开通的。在这里施工，遇到了排烟、排水、塌方等重重困难。为了排除困难，民工们一共打了三十四个竖井，最深的达六十二米，最浅的也在二十多米以上。洞里渗水，他们用水桶等工具向外提；洞顶塌方，他们用木料支撑，以料石圈砌；放炮的硝烟排不出去，他们就下到洞里用衣服向外扇。
    在一干渠建筑高二十四米桃园渡桥的时候，需要三千根木料搭脚手架，而总指挥部只能解决一千根。这时，在这里施工的民工们吸取了民间建房上梁的办法，设计一个简易的拱架法，克服了木料不足的困难。二干渠上四百一十三米长，四米宽的大渡槽，全由一块块料石垒砌起来的，有人说这是红旗渠的一个巨大的“工艺品”。		发扬自力更生的革命精神
    红旗渠是林县人民依靠人民公社集体经济力量，发扬自力更生的革命精神建成的。修建总干渠和三个干渠所用的资金共是四千二百三十六万多元，其中，百分之七十九点五是由县、公社和大队、生产队自筹的。
    这条渠道工程动工的时候，正是我国遭受严重自然灾害的时期。这时候，林县人民不伸手向国家要投资，要材料，而是发扬自力更生的革命精神，依靠集体力量自己筹划。他们在施工过程中使用自己仅有的一点资金时，总是精打细算，把小钱当个“碾盘”使。非生产性费用，一钱不花；自己能制造的，坚决不买；非花不可的，也要算了又算，抠了又抠。为了节约资金，工地上把匠人们组织起来，办了炸药加工厂、木工厂、铁匠炉、石灰窑、木工修缮队和编筐小组。他们创造了省钱的“明窑烧灰”办法，烧出近三亿斤石灰，比买现成的节约资金一半以上；修渠用的一半以上的炸药也是自己制造的，买一斤炸药的资金就能制造十斤炸药。他们还自己编制了两万一千多个抬筐，纺了三万八千多斤麻绳，利用废木料制造两千多辆小车；手锤、大锤等工具全部由工地制造，总共节约开支二百多万元。
    林县人民修建红旗渠，没有一个工程师，也没有一个大学生，技术力量也是自力更生解决的——主要依靠当地的老匠人和少数几个中等专业学校毕业的技术人员。在建设过程中，老石匠路银变成了出色的农民工程师，他根据实践经验提出修改焦家屯大渡槽的设计，为国家节约十几万元建设资金，还提高了质量；机关里一个通讯员李天德，已经成为一个既能测量又能设计的水利技术员；普通农民常根虎成了著名的崩山炮手。贫农出身的吹鼓手郭金良，学成了人人佩服的石匠手艺。这些人是修建红旗渠的骨干。在红旗渠上，有三万多个普通农民成了熟练的石匠，二百多人学会了测量。为今后进一步建设山区，培养出一批又红又专的技术人材。		感人的共产主义风格
    红旗渠是越省境、跨县界建成的。它体现了人民公社时代集体农民的共产主义风格。红旗渠从侯壁断下开始，有四十里渠线穿过山西省平顺县境内的太行山。山西省委和平顺县委毅然更改了修建两座水电站的规划；平顺县石城和王家庄两个公社的社员，让出了近千亩耕地，迁移了祖坟，砍掉了大批树木，让林县人修渠。石城大队老贫农孔东新说：“咱天下农民是一家，不能看着林县的阶级兄弟受干旱的害，过苦日子，咱平顺县毁几百亩地就能救林县几十万亩地，这是一步丢卒保车的好棋。”王家庄大队王伦说：“毁了树可以再栽，咱少吃点花椒和水果是小事，让林县几十万人喝上水是大事！”当林县修渠大军来到平顺县时，石城和王家庄两个公社的很多社员，让出自己的好房子，供民工住；有的把自己的毯子铺在民工的床上；有的用家里准备过节的白面和鸡蛋慰问生病的民工。山西人民这种共产主义风格，受到林县人们普遍赞扬，也激励了他们的斗志，为他们战胜困难修建红旗渠增添了精神力量。

    英雄的林县人民创建的红旗渠，盘绕在巍峨险峻的太行山腰，穿过五十多处高二百米以上的悬崖峭壁，工程十分艰险。
    林县人民用顽强的革命精神凿穿了一座又一座大山，让红旗渠穿洞而过。这是社员们正在开凿一条长达八华里的曙光洞渠道工程。
    红旗渠建成了，林县人民祖祖辈辈梦寐以求的愿望终于实现。这几位老贫农怀着喜悦的心情来到工地，参观完工的红旗渠。
    红旗渠的建成改变了林县面貌。这个千年苦旱的白家庄，现在变成了江南水乡。
