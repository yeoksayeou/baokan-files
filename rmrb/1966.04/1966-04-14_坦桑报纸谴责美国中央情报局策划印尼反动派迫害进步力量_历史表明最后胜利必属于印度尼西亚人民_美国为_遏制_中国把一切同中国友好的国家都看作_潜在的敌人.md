    New China News Agency, Dar es Salaam, 12th. The Tanzanian newspaper *The Nationalist* published a commentary on the atrocities committed by Indonesian reactionaries in launching a military coup and persecuting the Communist Party and progressive forces, stating that it was the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency that laid the "foundation" for suppressing the progressive forces in Indonesia.
    The newspaper pointed out that the Indonesian Communist Party and its leaders were "the main targets of imperialism" because the imperialists believed they were "dangerous" to imperialist interests.
    The commentary said that imperialist countries have vested interests in Indonesia and nearby regions: the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands all have economic enterprises in Indonesia, many of which had been nationalized by the Indonesian government before the coup. Britain also has military obligations in so-called "Malaysia" and a naval base in Singapore.
    The commentary emphasized that before the coup in Indonesia, the Indonesian government was friendly to the People's Republic of China. However, for the sake of its strategic interests in "containing" China, the United States regards all countries friendly to China as "potential enemies" of the United States.
    The commentary said that the history of Indonesia and all developing countries shows that "the people will ultimately triumph, and the imperialists will be defeated."

    坦桑报纸谴责美国中央情报局策划印尼反动派迫害进步力量
    历史表明最后胜利必属于印度尼西亚人民
    美国为“遏制”中国把一切同中国友好的国家都看作“潜在的敌人”
    新华社达累斯萨拉姆十二日电　坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》就印度尼西亚反动派发动军事政变，迫害共产党和进步力量的暴行发表评论说，为镇压印度尼西亚进步力量打好“基础”的正是美国中央情报局。
    报纸指出，印度尼西亚共产党和它的领导人是“帝国主义的主要目标”，因为帝国主义者认为，他们对帝国主义的利益是“危险的”。
    评论说，帝国主义国家在印度尼西亚和在印度尼西亚附近的地区拥有既得利益：美国、英国和荷兰在印度尼西亚都拥有经济企业，其中有不少在印度尼西亚发生政变之前，已经被印度尼西亚政府收归国有。英国在所谓“马来西亚”还承担了军事义务，在新加坡又设有海军基地。
    评论强调指出，在印度尼西亚发生政变之前，印度尼西亚政府同人民中国是友好的。但是，美国为了它的“遏制”中国的战略利益，把一切同中国友好的国家都看作美国的“潜在的敌人”。
    评论说，印度尼西亚和一切发展中的国家的历史表明，“最后取得胜利的将是人民，而被打败的是帝国主义者”。
