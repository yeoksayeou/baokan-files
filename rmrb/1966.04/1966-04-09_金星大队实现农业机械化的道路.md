    The Jinxing Brigade, while carrying out the socialist education movement, mainly relied on its own accumulation and used agricultural machinery produced in the province to implement mechanization in the main production links that occupy the most labor and affect agricultural high yield. Within a year, the total income from agriculture and sideline occupations doubled, and the investment in machinery can be basically recovered. This is a road to achieving mechanization starting from the actual situation in rural areas.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 8th) What kind of agricultural mechanization should be pursued that both meets the urgent needs of communes and brigades and is also achievable by them? Relevant leading departments of Hubei Province, through a year of experimentation in the Jinxing Brigade of Wolong Commune in Xiaogan County, have obtained a clear answer: mechanization should be implemented in the main production links that occupy the most labor and affect high agricultural yield, so as to achieve increased production and income; implementing this standard of mechanization, regardless of rich or poor brigades, can be achieved in a relatively short period of time mainly by relying on their own accumulation.
    The Jinxing Brigade has 1,400 mu of paddy fields and more than 500 mu of dry land. Compared with 1964, grain production in 1965 increased by 60%, and the total output value of agriculture and sideline occupations increased by more than double. The per capita income of the entire brigade increased by more than double. Why did this huge leap occur this year? The commune members said: This is because the socialist education movement promoted the revolutionization of people, coupled with the realization of agricultural mechanization.
    The Jinxing Brigade is located in a plain area with concentrated land, good water source conditions, and not bad soil quality. On average, each labor force (including semi-labor force) only bears 2.7 mu of land, mainly planting double-cropping rice. During the period of cooperativization, there were great changes in production here. After the communization, there was another leap in production, and the grain yield per mu was much higher than during the cooperativization period. However, in the past few years after the communization, in normal years, grain production has been hovering around 700 to 800 jin. In the 1964 socialist education movement, the consciousness of the commune members of the Jinxing Brigade was greatly improved. They urgently demanded to expand the replanting area, vigorously carry out scientific farming, and increase grain production; develop diversified management, and strive to develop sideline occupations to increase cash income. However, to achieve these goals, the labor force felt very strained. In order to solve this contradiction, simultaneously with the socialist education movement, the relevant leading organs of Hubei Province conducted an agricultural mechanization pilot project here using agricultural machinery produced in the province, and adopted the method of state loans and self-raised funds to purchase two hand-held tractors, two threshers, four drum threshers, eight electric motors, eight water pumps, and some grain, cotton, and oil processing machinery.
    The machinery equipped for the Jinxing Brigade is mainly aimed at the agricultural work that occupies the most labor, and mechanization is implemented in the links where labor is most strained during the harvest season. The configuration of these machines has enabled the brigade to achieve partial mechanization in plowing, and basic mechanization in drought resistance, waterlogging drainage, threshing, and processing of rice, flour, cotton, and oil. The masses said: The mechanization we implemented is of a low standard. Although there are not many machines, they have achieved one goal: saving a lot of labor. In the past, one ox and one person could only plow one mu of paddy field in eight hours. Now, one hand-held tractor operated by one person can plow at least nine mu of paddy field in eight hours. The brigade is located in a low-lying area and is prone to waterlogging. After a few days of sunshine, it is necessary to start drought resistance. In the past, the entire brigade's water-wheeling labor for drainage and drought resistance accounted for 20% to 30% of the total labor input throughout the year. Last year, there was another drought and waterlogging, but due to the electric irrigation and drainage station, the amount of labor used was only 0.2%. In the past, women here had to spend a lot of time at home grinding flour and pounding rice, and could not go out to work. Now, with rice and flour processing machinery, each female commune member generally has more than 80 to 100 more workdays throughout the year. According to preliminary calculations, the brigade saved a total of more than 41,000 workdays last year, which is equivalent to 25% of the brigade's total labor input last year. The saved labor solved many problems in the production development of the production team, and advanced towards the depth and breadth of agricultural production. Last year, both early and late rice were weeded twice, and some fields were weeded three times. The replanting area of late rice reached 95%, and rice transplanting ended ten days earlier than in the past. Every field seized the season, and achieved reasonable close planting. The yield per mu of rice increased by more than 50% compared with 1964. Last year, the entire brigade tried to plant 250 mu of cotton. They planted well and managed carefully, applied fertilizer five times, weeded seven times, treated insects seven times, and topped and pruned in time for the season. They achieved a bumper harvest of cotton, with an average yield of more than 130 jin of ginned cotton per mu. In addition, each production team organized special personnel to engage in perennial and seasonal sideline production such as pig raising, silkworm raising, duck raising, and kiln firing. Sideline production has been greatly developed.
    With such a low standard of agricultural mechanization, what other conditions are needed to ensure stable and high yield, increased production and income? Judging from the situation in the Jinxing Brigade last year, the first is to strive to improve water conservancy and irrigation conditions so that the drainage and irrigation machinery can pump water up and drain it out; vigorously accumulate and manufacture fertilizer to ensure that all crops have enough fertilizer; continuously improve the soil and increase land fertility; promote improved varieties and vigorously carry out scientific farming. Secondly, machinery should be added in complete sets as much as possible, and mechanization and semi-mechanization should be carried out in parallel, that is, in the four links of plowing, threshing, pumping, and processing, machinery should be equipped together (in areas with gravity irrigation, less or no pumping machinery may be needed), and each production team should also appropriately add some semi-mechanized tools such as flatbed trucks. Third, the use of human power, animal power, and machinery should be well integrated. One cannot rely on machinery, but give full play to the role of human power and animal power.
    With fewer machines, it is even more necessary to manage them well and use them well. The Jinxing Brigade adopts the method of unified management and unified use by the brigade. They concentrate a small number of people to manage the machines. When the machines are running, they concentrate on that, and when the machines are not running, they return to the team to participate in agricultural production. In this way, personnel can be versatile, giving full play to the work potential of each person; machines and maintenance tools can be comprehensively utilized, giving full play to their efficiency; funds can be used in a unified manner, using the funds where they are most needed. Truly achieve making the best use of everyone's talents and making the best use of everything. When in use, the brigade, according to the labor force, cattle, and crop stubble of each production team, uniformly arranges the time and sequence of machine operations, so that each production team can make good use of cattle and human power and give full play to the spirit of initiative in production.
    The Jinxing Brigade used to be a poor brigade. The fact that they realized this low standard of mechanization within one year solved their thinking that mechanization was unattainable. In the past, when some people mentioned mechanization, they would immediately ask for large tractors and large electric irrigation and drainage stations, and require the use of machines in all aspects at once. This "greed for the big and foreign" thinking made some people see mechanization as very mysterious, believing that it could not be realized all at once, nor could it be done by the production team, and even made many elderly commune members feel that it was not a matter for their generation, so they pinned their hopes on the state's mechanical station. Now, the comrades of the Jinxing Brigade realize that this idea is divorced from reality: First, the state cannot provide so many large machines for the time being, and some large machines may not be able to exert the greatest efficiency in the production team; second, buying large machines cannot be done with short-term accumulation; third, the experience of running machines must be explored slowly. If many machines are run at once, and the technology and management cannot keep up, the cost will definitely be high, the production team will not be able to afford it, and it is likely that production will increase but income will not, failing to show the superiority of mechanization. Therefore, production brigades must run machines from the actual needs, economic conditions, use technology, and management level of the team to free up labor, vigorously carry out scientific farming, implement intensive cultivation and meticulous farming, and develop diversified management and sideline occupations.
    The existing machinery of the Jinxing Brigade belongs to the state investment for experimentation, accounting for about 14,000 yuan. Plus the part they bought themselves, the total value is more than 35,000 yuan (they bought a set of oil pressing equipment worth more than 10,000 yuan. This set of equipment has a large processing capacity, and general brigades may not purchase it). From May 1965 to February this year, within ten months, the net income from grain, cotton, and oil processing using machinery was more than 11,000 yuan, and the state investment part could be fully recovered in about one year. They call this "using machines to support machines" to develop machinery. In addition, due to the machinery, labor was saved, the grain replanting area was expanded, and diversified management and sideline production were developed, so that the total income of agriculture and sideline occupations of the entire brigade increased by more than double compared with the previous year. Now the brigade (including each production team) has a public accumulation of more than 40,000 yuan, which can purchase a complete set of existing mechanical equipment.
    The fact that the Jinxing Brigade runs machines proves that general production brigades can completely rely on their own strength to achieve this low standard of mechanization in a relatively short period of time. The specific method, judging from the pilot situation, is generally to first run power machinery to solve the problem of drainage and irrigation, and then use power to develop processing machinery, "using machines to support machines", and then develop tillage machinery and other machinery. This is a road to achieving mechanization starting from the actual situation in rural areas.

    金星大队实现农业机械化的道路
    他们在开展社会主义教育运动的同时，主要依靠自己的积累，用本省生产的农业机械，在占用劳力最多、影响农业高产的主要生产环节上实行机械化。一年之内，农副业总收入成倍增加，并且可以基本上把机器投资收回来。这是从农村实际情况出发实现机械化的道路
    本报武汉八日电　办个什么样的农业机械化，既符合社、队急切需要，又是社队可以办到的？湖北省有关领导部门在孝感县卧龙公社金星大队通过去年一年的试验得到明确的答案：要在占用劳力最多、影响农业高产的主要生产环节上实行机械化，就能达到增产增收；实行这种标准的机械化，不管富队、穷队，都能主要依靠自己的积累在比较短的期间内办到。
    金星大队有一千四百亩水田，五百多亩旱地，一九六五年与一九六四年相比，粮食增产百分之六十，农副业总产值增长一倍多，全大队每人平均收入增加一倍多。这一年为什么会出现这个巨大的飞跃呢？社员们说：这是社会主义教育运动促进了人的革命化加上实现了农业机械化。
    金星大队地处平原，土地集中，水源条件好，土质也不差，平均每个劳力（包括半劳力）只负担二亩七分地，主要种双季稻。合作化时期，这里生产有很大变化，公社化以后生产又有一个飞跃，粮食单产比合作化时期提高很多。但是，公社化以后这几年，正常年景，粮食产量也就老在七百至八百斤上下打转转。一九六四年社会主义教育运动，金星大队的社员觉悟大大提高，迫切要求扩大复种面积，大搞科学种田，提高粮食产量；开展多种经营，努力发展副业，增加现金收入。但是，要做到这些，劳力感到很紧张。为了解决这个矛盾，在社会主义教育运动的同时，湖北省有关领导机关在这里用本省生产的农业机械办了农业机械化试点，采取国家贷款和自筹资金的办法，先后购进了两台手扶拖拉机、二台脱粒机、四台滚筒脱粒机、八台电动机、八台水泵和一些粮棉油加工机械。
    金星大队配备的这些机械，主要是针对占用劳力最多的农活，在抢季节劳力最紧张的环节实行机械化。这些机械的配备，就使这个大队在耕田方面实现了部分机械化，在抗旱、排渍、脱粒、米、面、棉、油加工方面基本上实现了机械化。群众说：我们实行的机械化是个低标准。机器虽然不多，但却达到了一个目的：大量节省劳力。原来一头牛和一个人，八小时只能犁一亩水田，现在一台手扶拖拉机由一个人操作，八小时至少可犁九亩水田；这个队地势较低，容易受渍；晴不几天，就要动手抗旱，以往全大队每年用于排渍、抗旱的车水工，要占全年投工数的百分之二十至三十。去年又遇上了抗旱、排渍，但由于有了电动排灌站，用工量只在千分之二。过去这里的妇女每年都要花很多的时间在家里磨面，舂米，不能出工，现在有了米、面加工机械，每个女社员全年一般都要多出八十至一百多个工。据初步计算，去年这个大队总共节省出四万一千多个工，相当于去年全大队总投工数的百分之二十五。节省的劳力解决了生产队发展生产上的许多问题，向农业生产的深度和广度进军。去年早稻和晚稻普遍都扯了两道草，少数田还扯了三道草。晚稻复种面积达到百分之九十五，插秧较过去提前十天结束，块块田都抢住了季节，并做到了合理密植，水稻单产比一九六四年提高百分之五十以上。去年全大队试种了二百五十亩棉花，种得好、管得细，施过五次肥，除过七次草，治过七次虫，整枝打杈都跟上了季节，获得棉花大丰收，平均亩产皮棉一百三十多斤。此外，各生产队又组织专人从事养猪、养蚕、养鸭、烧窑等常年和季节性的副业生产，副业生产得到很大发展。
    有了这样一个低标准的农业机械化，要想确保稳产高产，增产增收，还要具备些什么条件呢？从金星大队去年的情况看，首先要努力改善水利排灌条件，使排灌机械能把水抽得起来，排得出去；大搞积肥造肥，保证各项农作物有足够的肥料；不断改良土壤，增长地力；推广良种，大搞科学种田。其次，做到机械尽量成套添置，机械化和半机械化并举，也就是说，在耕田、脱粒、抽水、加工四个环节，一起配上机械（自流灌溉的地方，抽水机械就可以少要或不要），各生产队也适当添置一些象板车一类的半机械化工具。第三是，人力、畜力、机械的使用要很好地结合起来，不能因为有了机械产生依赖思想，要充分发挥人力、畜力的作用。
    机器少，更要管得好用得好。金星大队是采取大队统一管理、统一使用的办法。他们集中少数人管理机器，开机器就集中，不开机器就回队参加农业生产。这样，在人员上可以一专多能，充分发挥每个人的工作潜力；机器和维修工具，可以综合利用，充分发挥它们的效率；资金可以做到统一使用，把资金用在刀刃上。真正做到人尽其才，物尽其用。使用时，大队根据各生产队的劳力、耕牛和作物茬口的情况，统一安排机器作业的时间和顺序，使各生产队能很好地把耕牛、人力充分使用起来，发挥生产上的主动精神。
    金星大队过去是个穷队，他们办机械，在一年内实现了这个低标准的机械化的事实，解决了他们实现机械化是高不可攀的思想。过去有些人一提办机械，动不动就要大型拖拉机，大型电动排灌站，要求一下子在各方面都用上机器。这种“贪大求洋”的思想，使得一些人把办机械看得很神秘，认为不是一下子可以实现的，也不是生产队办得起来的，甚至使许多年老的社员感到不是他们这一辈子的事，因此把希望寄托在国家办机械站上。现在，金星大队的同志们认识到这种想法脱离实际：一是国家一时拿不出那么多大型机械，有些大型机械也不一定在生产队能发挥最大效率；二是买大型机械不是短时间的积累能办到的；三是办机械的经验要慢慢摸索，一下子办很多机械，技术、管理跟不上，成本一定高，生产队负担不起，很可能增产不增收，显示不出机械化的优越性。因此，生产大队办机械，必须从本队的实际需要、经济条件、使用技术、管理水平出发，达到腾出劳力，大搞科学种田，实行精耕细作，开展多种经营和发展副业。
    金星大队现有的机械，属于国家投资作试验的部分约一万四千元，加上他们自己购买的部分，总值在三万五千多元（他们自己购买的有一套榨油设备价值一万多元，这套设备加工能力很大，一般大队可不购置）他们从一九六五年五月到今年二月的十个月内，利用机械搞粮、棉、油加工的纯收入共有一万一千多元，大约有一年的时间就可把国家投资部分全部收回，他们叫这为“以机养机”发展机械。另外，由于有了机械，节省了劳力，扩大了粮食复种面积，发展了多种经营和副业生产，使全大队的农副业总收入较上一年增加一倍多。现在这个大队（包括各生产队）有公共积累四万多元，可以购买现有机械设备一整套。
    金星大队办机械的事实证明，一般生产大队是完全可以依靠自己的力量、在较短的时间内实现这个低标准的机械化的。具体办法，从试点情况看，一般是先办动力机械，解决排灌水的问题，接着利用动力发展加工机械，“以机养机”，然后再发展耕作机械和其他机械。这是从农村实际情况出发实现机械化的道路。
