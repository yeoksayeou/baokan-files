    Thoroughly Eliminate the Poisonous Influence of Wu Han on Us

    1961 was a time of extremely acute and complex class struggle. Internationally, class enemies frantically opposed China, and domestically, landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and demons and monsters all emerged to launch a wild attack against the Party and socialism. At the same time, the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the younger generation was extremely fierce, becoming an important component of the class struggle. At this critical moment, Wu Han, with the posture of an "authority," pretended to "care" about the progress and growth of young people, giving speeches everywhere, writing articles, and authoring books, acting as the vanguard of the bourgeoisie in the struggle for the younger generation.
    In many articles, Wu Han disseminated bourgeois toxins, opposed Mao Zedong Thought, and opposed the Party's educational policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. In 1961 and 1962, a countercurrent emerged on the education front. The bourgeois educational thinking of "intellectual education first" and the idea of personal fame and gain resurfaced. Wu Han also stood up and applauded. He said, "In the past six months or so, especially college students... have been studying diligently, and this wave is really big." He also said: "One wave urges another, the later wave urges the earlier wave, the momentum is getting bigger and bigger, rolling and endless," "This is truly a great situation in academic and cultural circles." From this, it is not difficult to see that the wave Wu Han referred to is not a wave of studying for the revolution, but a wave of studying books detached from proletarian politics and reality; it is not a wave of studying diligently for the cause of the Party; but a wave of studying diligently "behind closed doors" for personal fame and gain; it is not a wave of seeking knowledge for the benefit of the people; but a wave of accumulating capital and bargaining with the Party. Thus, it can be seen that Wu Han's so-called "wave" is a countercurrent that opposes the Party's education policy and opposes Chairman Mao's educational thought.
    In some articles, Wu Han also said that "young people have participated in many political movements," but "they haven't read enough books, nor are they solid enough." He also particularly viciously accused young people of having "little teaching experience, not having entered the door of research work, and some of them don't even know how to use reference books," "not being old, not being specialized, and not even starting a family." What does this mean? Isn't this blatantly denying the great significance of political movements and opposing young people's participation in political movements and social practice? Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "In addition to learning a major, we must make progress in thinking and in politics." Chairman Mao also taught us: "To learn Marxism, we must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, work practice, and approaching the workers and peasants, can we truly learn." Wu Han's argument completely runs counter to our Party and Mao Zedong Thought.
    In order to make young people follow in his footsteps, Wu Han also wanted young people to bury themselves in old papers and achieve fame and gain through "three diligences," namely "diligent reading, diligent copying, and diligent writing." The "three diligences" mentioned by Wu Han are actually three separations: separation from proletarian politics, separation from reality, and separation from workers and peasants, that is, opposing intellectuals' participation in political movements, opposing the combination of theoretical study with the actual situation of class struggle at home and abroad, and opposing young intellectuals going to the workers, peasants, and soldiers and combining with the masses of workers and peasants. What is particularly vicious is that Wu Han openly said to young people: "Anyone can become an expert scholar, the key lies in whether he works hard and whether he can overcome all the difficulties that stand in his way." He arrogantly clamored: "People must master the environment, not be dominated by the environment." This is inciting young people not to listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and to embark on the road of opposing the Party and opposing socialism in order to achieve fame and gain.
    In February 1963, Wu Han also ran to our school to give a report. In this report, Wu Han vigorously peddled bourgeois private goods. He said that "proletarian intellectuals must pass three tests: literacy, theory, and expertise." He also said with ulterior motives, "Seize every hour to study, make the most of every minute, wasting time is a loss in life." In order to provide a model, Wu Han specifically introduced his own so-called experience of using his spare time to write a collection of 200,000 words called *Learning Collection*. When a classmate asked him how he wrote articles, he unreservedly said: "This is because I was too poor at the time." You see, making money is the guiding ideology and huge motivation for Wu Han to become an expert, scholar, and professor.
    At that time, because our class consciousness was not high, we were unconsciously influenced by him. We thought that the key now was to study hard and pass the three tests in our profession. Therefore, some students were busy finding materials, copying cards, and writing diligently. Some students collected the stories of so-called celebrities who studied hard from ancient times to the present and from home and abroad into a small booklet as their model. Under the impact of the bourgeois wave, we did not stand firm and drank a few mouthfuls of bitter water.
    At this critical juncture, the Party and Chairman Mao once again sounded the alarm, pointing out that there are still classes and class struggle in the socialist period, and instructing us to go to practice, to the three major revolutionary movements, and to temper and grow up in the great storm of class struggle. Following the teachings of the Party and Chairman Mao, we successively participated in two rural socialist education movements and a half-year educational internship in the countryside. In the flames of class struggle, in the "three togethers" with the poor and lower-middle peasants, and under the infection of the revolutionary qualities of the poor and lower-middle peasants, our thoughts and feelings changed. We learned many things that could not be learned in school at all, truly learned living Marxism-Leninism, and began to understand that knowledge is created by the working people and belongs to the working people. The knowledge we have learned should be returned to the working people and serve the people. In revolutionary practice, we further recognized that treating knowledge as private property and capital for obtaining fame and wealth, like Wu Han, is a plundering of the wealth of the working people and a betrayal of the broad masses of working people.
    Now, we realize that the proletariat has never opposed mastering professional knowledge. Studying hard for the revolution is what the Party and Chairman Mao have always advocated. However, Wu Han's political purpose in asking us to study hard and pass the "three tests" is to oppose young people from studying Mao Zedong Thought and participating in the three major revolutionary movements. This serves his anti-Party and anti-socialist purposes.
    In a few months, we will graduate. We must thoroughly eliminate the poisonous influence of Wu Han on us and resolutely not follow the path taken by Wu Han. We must more resolutely listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, go to the countryside, go to half-work and half-study schools, go to the most needed and most difficult places in the motherland, resolutely take the path of proletarian intellectuals, and be successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    彻底清除吴晗对我们的毒害
      北京师范大学政教系学生董薇园　焦黄先　任惠元  郑秀梅　马霭云
    一九六一年正是阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂的时刻。国际上阶级敌人大肆反华，国内地富反坏、牛鬼蛇神一齐出笼，向党向社会主义发动猖狂进攻。与此同时，资产阶级同无产阶级争夺青年一代的斗争十分激烈，成为阶级斗争的一个重要组成部分。就在这关键时刻，吴晗以一个“权威者”的姿态，伪装出一副“关心”青年进步成长的嘴脸，到处演讲、写文章、著书立说，充当资产阶级争夺青年一代的急先锋。
    吴晗在许多文章中，大肆散布资产阶级的毒素，反对毛泽东思想，反对党的教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育方针。一九六一年，一九六二年，教育战线上出现了一股逆流。一些人“智育第一”的资产阶级教育思想和个人名利思想，又重新抬头。吴晗也站出来，拍手叫好。他说什么“这半年多来，特别是高等学校的学生……都用功读书，这股浪头可真大”。又说：“一浪催一浪，后浪催前浪，劲头越来越大，滚滚滔滔，无穷无尽”，“这真是学术文化界的大好形势”。从这里就不难看出，吴晗所指的浪，不是为革命读书的浪，而是脱离无产阶级政治，脱离实际，死读书本的浪；也不是为党的事业而勤学的浪；而是为个人成名成家而“关门”勤学的浪；也不是为人民利益而求知的浪；而是积累资本，向党讨价还价的浪。由此可见，吴晗的所谓“浪”是反对党的教育方针、反对毛主席教育思想的一股逆流。
    吴晗在一些文章中，还说什么“青年们参加了很多政治运动”，但是“书读得不够多，也不够扎实”。他还特别恶毒地指责青年们“教学经验少，研究工作还没有入门，其中有的连工具书也不会用”，“一不老、二不专、三还不成家”。这是什么意思？这不是明目张胆地否认政治运动的伟大意义，反对青年参加政治运动和社会实践吗？毛主席一再教导我们：“除了学习专业之外，在思想上要有所进步，政治上也要有所进步”。毛主席还教导我们：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到”。吴晗的论调完全是和我们党和毛泽东思想唱反调的。
    吴晗为了使青年步他的后尘，还要青年们埋头于故纸堆中，通过“三勤”即“勤读、勤抄、勤写”成名成家。吴晗所说的“三勤”，实际上就是三脱离：脱离无产阶级政治、脱离实际、脱离工农，就是反对知识分子参加政治运动，反对理论学习同当前国内外阶级斗争的实际相联系，反对青年知识分子到工农兵中去，和工农群众相结合。尤其恶毒的是，吴晗向青年们公开地说：“任何一个人都可以成为专家学者，问题的关键就在于自己是否努力，是否能克服挡在他面前的一切困难”。他狂妄地叫嚷：“人要掌握环境，而不能被环境所支配”。这就是煽动青年们不要听党和毛主席的话，为了成名成家不惜走上反党反社会主义的道路。
    一九六三年二月，吴晗还跑到我们学校作报告。吴晗在这个报告中大肆贩卖资产阶级私货。他说什么“无产阶级知识分子必须过三关：文字关、理论关、专业关”。他还别有用心地说，“抓紧每一小时进行学习，化零为整，浪费时间就是一生中的损失”。为了提供样板，吴晗特意介绍了他自己就是利用空余时间写出了二十万字《学习集》的所谓经验。当会上有同学问他是怎么写文章的时候，他毫不掩饰地说：“这是因为当时我太穷了。”你看，赚钱就是吴晗成为专家学者教授的指导思想和巨大动力。
    当时，由于我们阶级觉悟不高，自觉不自觉地受了他的影响，以为现在关键的关键是努力读书，业务上要过好三关，因此，有的同学整天热中于找资料，抄卡片，真是勤抄勤写，忙个不停。有的同学把古今中外所谓名人刻苦学习的故事收集为一个小册子，作为自己的榜样。我们在资产阶级浪头的冲击下，没有站稳脚跟，喝了几口苦水。
    在这紧要关头，党和毛主席再一次敲起了警钟，指出社会主义时期还存在阶级和阶级斗争，并且指示我们到实践中去，到三大革命运动中去，在阶级斗争的大风浪中锻炼成长。我们按照党和毛主席的教导，先后参加了两次农村社会主义教育运动和半年下乡的教育实习。在阶级斗争的烈火中，在和贫下中农“三同”中，在贫下中农革命品质的感染下，我们的思想感情发生了变化。学习了许多在学校里根本不可能学到的东西，真正学到活的马列主义，开始懂得了：知识是由劳动人民创造出来的，是属于劳动人民的。我们学到的知识应该还给劳动人民、为人民服务。在革命实践中，我们更进一步认清了象吴晗那样把知识当作私有财产和获取名利的资本就是对劳动人民财富的掠夺，就是对广大劳动人民的背叛。
    现在，我们认识到，无产阶级从来没有反对掌握专业知识。为了革命而发奋读书，这是党和毛主席向来就提倡的。而吴晗要我们认真读书过“三关”的政治目的在于反对青年学习毛泽东思想，参加三大革命运动，这是为他的反党反社会主义目的服务的。
    再过几个月，我们就要毕业了。我们一定要彻底清除吴晗对我们的毒害，坚决不走吴晗所走过的道路。我们要更加坚决地听党和毛主席的话，到农村中去，到半工半读的学校去，到祖国最需要最艰苦的地方去，坚决走无产阶级知识分子的道路，做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
