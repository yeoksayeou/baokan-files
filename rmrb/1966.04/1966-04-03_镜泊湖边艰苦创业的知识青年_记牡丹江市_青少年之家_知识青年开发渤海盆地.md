    Knowledgeable Youths Bravely Start Businesses by Jingpo Lake
    —Recording the Knowledgeable Youths from Mudanjiang City's "Youth Center" Developing the Bohai Basin
      The knowledgeable youths from Mudanjiang City’s "Youth Center" who went to develop the Bohai Basin are young but ambitious and full of vigor. Under the leadership of the Party, they cultivated a large amount of wasteland with their own hands and built a new "home." They also tempered and transformed themselves in productive labor. They developed a strong affection for the countryside and are determined to take root, blossom, and bear fruit here.
    On May 4, 1965, more than one hundred knowledgeable youths from Mudanjiang City’s "Youth Center," with the lofty aspiration of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, established the Mudanjiang City Lianhua Youth Farm in the Bohai Basin surrounded by mountains in Ning'an County. The relevant departments of the city and the "Youth Center," adhering to the spirit of being responsible for the students to the end, often sent cadres and teachers to visit them, labor with them, cooperate with the farm leaders to conduct ideological and political education for the students, and help solve some learning and living difficulties, which encouraged the young people. These young people, whose average age was only seventeen or eighteen, were young but ambitious and full of vigor. Under the leadership of the Party, they used their own hands to cultivate ripe land and open up new wasteland, producing more than 200,000 jin of grain for the country in the first year.
    Be a Revolutionary Good Seed
    How did these young people embark on the revolutionary road? And how did they temper, grow, and take root in the countryside? It was the "Youth Center" that laid a good foundation for the young people ideologically, enabling them to embark on the revolutionary journey of aspiring to engage in agriculture.
    Last spring, students at the "Youth Center" launched a wave of going up to the mountains and down to the countryside. In just a few days, big-character posters were posted everywhere in the small auditorium, offices, and corridors: "Obeying the needs of the revolution is our youth's ideal!" "Go up to the mountains and down to the countryside, to the most arduous places!"
    Cheng Fenglian, an eighteen-year-old junior high school graduate, was initially unmoved. She thought, "The countryside is too arduous, whoever wants to go can go, I can make revolution in the city too!" However, one day when the teacher was teaching the lesson "Serve the People," he said: The country needs to develop agricultural production, and young people should not be afraid of hardship to change the poor and blank state of the countryside. Little Fenglian's face burned, and she couldn't calm down. She thought: If I am afraid of hardship, what kind of revolutionary youth am I?
    Little Fenglian felt that her thinking was wrong. For the first time, she brought her questions and repeatedly studied "The Direction of the Youth Movement" and "Serve the People," gradually making her understand that a young person should live for the people and die for the people. After several days and nights of intense ideological struggle, Little Fenglian finally stood up and posted a big-character poster, determined to build a new socialist countryside with her classmates. She specially asked someone to buy a set of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" from Beijing, preparing to study it after going to the countryside, and use Mao Zedong's thought to spur and encourage herself, overcome difficulties, and take root in the countryside.
    More than one hundred knowledgeable youths who competed to sign up and were approved, like Cheng Fenglian, made ideological preparations for engaging in agriculture. They packed their bags, awaiting departure, and put forward the resounding slogan: We vow to be a revolutionary good seed, wherever the Party sows us, we will blossom there.
    At this time, the fourteen-year-old girl Feng Guofang was very anxious. She graduated from senior primary school in 1964 and came to the "Youth Center." Feng Guofang had long aspired to be a female tractor driver, hoping to open up large tracts of wasteland and produce more grain for socialism. Therefore, she also signed up. However, the teachers and classmates shook their heads, saying that she was too young to go. Little Guofang was very unconvinced, swinging her two braids and running to the person in charge of the municipal labor department. She said, "Liu Hulan was a woman, and for the revolution, she was approved to join the Party ahead of schedule. Why can't I be approved to engage in agriculture ahead of schedule?" Her determination to engage in agriculture moved the leading comrade, and after research, her request was finally approved.
    Little Yugong of the New Era
    In May in the north, it was still a bit chilly, but these young people started their arduous journey by Jingpo Lake with a fiery heart.
    The Lianhua Youth Farm was established on the site of an old livestock farm. It received more than 1,000 mu of land, some livestock, and only a few dilapidated thatched houses. When the young people arrived here, they seized the favorable opportunity before the summer hoeing began to concentrate on basic construction.
    Moving stones began. Without tools, everyone carried them on their backs and shoulders. A long snake formation was set up on the road, chasing and catching up with each other, talking and singing. However, the stones became less and less, the transport distance became longer and longer, and the physical consumption became greater and greater. A severe test came: some people rubbed their backs raw, and some people crushed their shoulders. However, everyone persevered tenaciously in labor.
    For several days, Cao Shuhua, a member of the Communist Youth League, a girl from the "Youth Center" singing and dancing troupe who could sing and dance and had never frowned, was also very tired like her companions. Little Shuhua studied Mao Zedong's works with this question in mind, and remembered the vows that everyone had made at the beginning: We are not here to enjoy, but to endure hardship, to make revolution, and to change the world. Now that we encounter a little difficulty, should we retreat? No! Little Shuhua began to be active on the construction site again.
    At this time, the Party and Youth League branches also organized everyone to repeatedly study articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Chairman Mao's teachings inspired the young people, and everyone's emotions rose again. For several consecutive days of overcast and rainy weather, they worked in the rain. The roads were muddy, and many people fell into mud monkeys. Cao Shuhua said humorously, "This time we don't need to put on makeup for the play." A word made everyone laugh.
    More than a month passed, and the stones slowly piled up into small mountains. The young people proudly said, "We have really become little Yugongs!" It was these little Yugongs who built and repaired nearly 900 square meters of houses, granaries, and stable walls with their own hands.
    In the first year of their team's establishment, in eight months, they reclaimed more than 800 mu of wasteland, plowed more than 900 mu of land, overcame floods and hail disasters, and achieved a good harvest. In addition to being completely self-sufficient, they also sold 30,000 jin of grain to the state and drew out some labor to engage in sideline production, with an income of more than 10,000 yuan. Various livestock have also reproduced, laying a good foundation for further development of production.
    Hard Training for the Revolution
    The young people, with the greatest revolutionary enthusiasm, stormed the technical barrier.
    During the summer hoeing season, the young men and women sang songs, braved the scorching sun, and waved hoes to shovel the ground. However, the hoe handle was not as obedient as the pen, and the more anxious they became, the more flustered they became, and they kept chopping at the roots of the seedlings; they used a lot of effort, but still couldn't keep up. Some of the young women cried, and some could only work in the morning and rest in the afternoon.
    At this critical moment, the Party and Youth League branches organized everyone to restudy "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End." The revolutionary spirit was immediately reinvigorated, and they actively went to learn labor skills. Therefore, the young people who had worked more in the "Youth Center" farm and knew some farm work became everyone's teachers invisibly. In the fields, they helped and learned from each other, learning while doing, and diligently practiced basic skills.
    Effort pays off, and they finally learned farm work initially, hoeing more than 1,000 mu of land fifteen days ahead of schedule, and then timely harvesting the grain in the autumn.
    Now, many people have initially learned the main farm work such as planting, hoeing, harvesting, threshing, driving, and raising livestock. The work of accounting, cashier, and warehousing is also done by themselves.
    Speaking of practicing basic skills, the girls in the cooking class are also among the best. When the team was first established, Li Lanhua, Ni Xiaodong, and Zhang Yuqin were assigned to the cafeteria to cook. For these girls, it was a big problem to supply meals for more than 100 people a day. At the beginning, a pot of rice was often cooked in three ways—raw on the top, cooked in the middle, and burnt on the bottom. Everyone didn't eat well and talked a lot, which made them cry. Li Lanhua said: "I was afraid of being a 'stove turner' at home, but I didn't expect to be turning around the stove again here. What's the point? I won't do this thankless 'stove turner'." A teacher from the "Youth Center" who was participating in the labor here encouraged her and said: "Your 'turn' is different from the 'turn' at home, that is a small 'turn', this is a big 'turn'!" Li Lanhua was very inspired after hearing this. Yes! What's the use of crying, let's go to Chairman Mao's works to find the answer and learn "Serve the People." Several girls got together, learning and discussing, and their hearts became clear. They said that in order to ensure production, they must be good revolutionary big "stove turners." Once, Ni Xiaodong and her companions in the cooking class, in order to let everyone eat fried dough sticks, kneaded more than a dozen small doughs, mixed them with different proportions of alum, alkali, and salt respectively, and put them in the oil pan for repeated experiments, working from evening to 11:00 p.m. The oil smoke filled the room, but the fried "dough sticks" were still black and bitter. Others advised her not to try anymore. Xiaodong didn't listen and insisted on experimenting, working all night until dawn, finally letting everyone eat fragrant and delicious fried dough sticks. Now, they are proficient in all kinds of cooking skills, and the meals are delicious, and everyone eats satisfactorily.
    The Roots are Growing Deeper and Deeper
    Eight months have passed, and the young people have been weathered and tempered in labor. Some families have been giving them some bad influences in terms of economy and emotion, but they have all resisted them. Although the struggle has just begun, the revolutionary roots are growing deeper and deeper, and everyone always keeps in mind the vows they made at the beginning: wholeheartedly engage in agriculture and carry the revolution through to the end.
    Recently, a young woman received a letter from her mother, the gist of which was that she was worried that her daughter would be cold and advised her to go home and "hibernate for the winter." The young woman immediately wrote back, saying: Mom's concern for me is understandable. However, how can your daughter covet personal comfort for the sake of the revolutionary cause and the interests of the people? …
    The young woman Li Shuqin also made such a record in her diary: Not long ago, I met some classmates from the "Youth Center" who were assigned to work in Mudanjiang City, and my heart moved a little, but I immediately realized that doing anything is revolution, and I am also taking the revolutionary road, and I must not give up halfway, I must stride forward to the end.
    In the ideological transformation struggle of young people, Zhao Rulong is a relatively prominent one. This twenty-three-year-old youth was deeply influenced by a bourgeois family. After graduating from junior high school and going to the "Youth Center" in 1962, he was assigned to burn boilers and repair roads, but he was afraid of getting dirty and disliked the low status, and he did not persevere in any of them. When he came to the farm with his companions this time, his family repeatedly mobilized him to go back, saying that relying on fixed interest could support him; they also made him clothes and often sent pastries, but he did not waver. He said that he would listen to Chairman Mao, take over the revolutionary class, and be determined to transform and temper himself in productive labor. In August, when there was a flood, he took the lead in wading through the rapids in the rain to rush and transport the sheep grass piled on the low-lying land; when his hand was cut and infected during the autumn harvest, he still insisted on working to the end; when the harvested soybeans were put into the warehouse, the sack leaked, and a little soybean was scattered on the ground, he immediately picked them up one by one, saying: "This is earned with sweat, not a single grain can be lost." Now, Zhao Rulong has joined the Communist Youth League and has been elected as a squad leader by his companions.
    The young people all love this revolutionary collective. Every day, they sing from waking up to sleeping, and hold several entertainment parties a month. They persist in militia training all year round.
    They are considerate of each other in life. The young women help the young men with sewing and mending, and the young men try not to let the young women do heavy work. They care for each other politically, and everyone asks for progress. The number of Youth League members in the entire team has increased from seven to twenty-three, and the team of Youth League activists has expanded from seven to fifty-six. Even Zhang Yuqin, who was pampered at home, could not live without an apple after meals, and was nicknamed "Little Apple," can now eat and work, and has learned to take care of her own affairs.
    The young people's vision has broadened, and they see further. They live in thatched cottages, have revolutionary aspirations, and are formulating long-term plans for developing production. Some young people who occasionally go home for some reason always feel that the circle of their personal family is too small. They all say, "Although the buildings in Mudanjiang City are beautiful, they are not as emotional as the thatched houses we built with our own hands; we are here, which is a place to make great achievements, and we must take root, blossom, and bear fruit here!"

    镜泊湖边艰苦创业的知识青年
    ——记牡丹江市“青少年之家”知识青年开发渤海盆地
      从牡丹江市“青少年之家”去开发渤海盆地的知识青年，人小志高，意气风发。在党的领导下，他们用自己的双手开垦了大量的荒地，建设起了新“家”。他们在生产劳动中，也锻炼改造了自己。他们对农村产生了浓厚的感情，决心在这里扎根、开花、结果。
    一九六五年五月四日，牡丹江市“青少年之家”的一百多名知识青年，怀着上山下乡的豪情壮志，在宁安县群山环绕的渤海盆地办起了牡丹江市莲花青年农场。市有关部门和“青少年之家”本着对学生负责到底的精神，经常派干部和教师去探望他们，同他们一起劳动，配合农场领导对学生进行思想政治教育，帮助解决一些学习和生活上的困难，这都使年轻人受到了鼓舞。这些平均年龄不过十七八岁的年轻人，人小志高，意气风发，在党的领导下，用自己的双手，种熟地，开新荒，头一年就给国家生产了二十多万斤粮食。
    做一颗革命的良种
    这些年轻人是怎样走上革命的道路？又是怎样在农村锻炼、成长和扎根的呢？是“青少年之家”从思想上给年轻人打下好底子，使他们踏上了立志务农的革命征途。
    去年春天，“青少年之家”的学生，掀起了上山下乡的热潮。几天光景，在小礼堂、办公室和走廊里，到处贴出了大字报：“服从革命需要，就是我们青年的理想！”“上山下乡，到最艰苦的地方去！”
    十八岁的初中毕业生程风莲，最初无动于中。心想：“农村太艰苦，谁愿去就去，我在城市革命也行嘛！”可是，有一天老师在讲《为人民服务》那课时说：国家需要发展农业生产，青年人应该不怕艰苦地去改变农村一穷二白的面貌。小风莲听了，脸上火辣辣的，心情怎么也平静不下来。她想：怕艰苦，还算什么革命青年呢？
    小风莲感到自己的思想不对头。第一次带上问题，反复学习《青年运动的方向》和《为人民服务》，逐步地使她懂得了：一个青年要生为人民生，死为人民死。经过几个日夜激烈的思想斗争，小风莲终于挺身而出，贴出了大字报，决心和同学们一起建设社会主义新农村。她特地托人从北京买回一套《毛泽东著作选读》，准备下乡后学，并且用毛主席的思想鞭策、激励自己，战胜困难，在农村扎根。
    争相报名、获得批准的一百多名知识青年，都象程风莲一样，做好了务农的思想准备。他们整好行装，待命出发，并且提出了响亮的口号：誓做一颗革命的良种，党把我们撒在那里，就在那里开花。
    在这个时候，十四岁的小姑娘冯国方可急坏了。她是一九六四年高小毕业后来到“青少年之家”的。冯国方早就立下了当个女拖拉机手的志愿，希望能为社会主义开出大片大片的荒地，多打粮食。所以，她也报了名。可是，老师和同学都摇头，说她年龄小，不能去。小国方很不服气，甩着两根小辫跑去找市劳动部门的负责人，她说：“刘胡兰是女的，为革命能批准她提前入党，为什么就不能批准我提前务农？”她立志务农的决心，感动了那位领导同志，经过研究，终于批准了她的请求。
    新时代的小愚公
    五月的北方，还有些凉飕飕的，这些年轻人却以一颗火热的心，开始在镜泊湖边艰苦创业。
    莲花青年农场是在一个原来畜牧场的旧址上办起来的。接收了一千多亩土地，一部分牲畜和仅有的几间破草房。年轻人来到这里，就抓紧夏锄尚未开始的有利时机，突击搞基本建设。
    搬运石头开始了，没有工具，大伙就用背驮、肩扛。路上摆开了一字长蛇阵，你追我赶，有说有唱。可是，石头越拣越少，运距越来越远，体力消耗越来越大。一场严峻的考验到来了：有的人磨破了背，有的人压肿了肩。可是，大家都顽强地坚持着劳动。
    几天来，共青团员曹淑华，这个从“青少年之家”歌舞团来的、能歌善舞、从来没有皱过眉头的姑娘，也和同伴一样，累得很。小淑华带着这个问题学了毛主席著作，想起了当初大伙发过的誓言：我们不是来享受，而是来吃苦、来革命、来改天斗地的，现在遇到一点困难，难道就要后退吗？不！小淑华又开始活跃在工地上。
    这时，党、团支部也组织大伙反复学习《愚公移山》等文章。毛主席的教导，激励着年轻人，大伙的情绪又高涨起来。接连几天阴雨，他们就冒着雨干，道路泥泞，不少人摔成了泥猴，曹淑华很有风趣地说：“这回演戏咱们可不用化装了。”一句话把大伙逗乐了。
    一个多月过去了，石头慢慢堆成了小山，年轻人都自豪地说：“咱们真成了小愚公啦！”就是这些小愚公，自己动手，新建和维修了近九百平方米的房屋、粮仓和马厩围墙。
    他们建队的第一年，在八个月内，开荒八百多亩，翻地九百多亩，战胜了涝灾、雹灾，获得了较好的收成，除全部自给外，还卖给了国家三万斤粮食，并抽出一部分劳力搞副业，收入一万多元。各种牲畜也都有了繁殖，为进一步发展生产打下了良好的基础。
    为革命苦练硬功
    年轻人，以最大的革命热情，猛闯技术关。
    夏锄时节，男女青年们唱着歌，顶着烈日，挥锄铲地。可是，锄杆却没有笔杆那么听使唤，越急心越慌，一个劲地往苗根上砍；用了很大的劲，还是撵不上。有的女青年急哭了，有的只能在上午劳动，下午就歇工了。
    在这个节骨眼上，党、团支部组织大家重学了《愚公移山》和《将革命进行到底》，革命精神顿时又振作起来，积极去学习劳动技术。于是，在“青少年之家”农场劳动较多、懂得一些农活的青年，无形中成了大家的师傅。在田间，互帮互学，边干边学，苦练基本功。
    功夫不负有心人，他们终于初步学会农活，提前十五天铲完上千亩地，又在秋天适时地把粮食收回来。
    现在，很多人初步学会了点种、铲趟、收割、打场、赶车和饲养等主要农活。会计、出纳、保管等工作，也由自己担任。
    谈到练基本功，炊事班的几个姑娘也是数得着的。刚建队时，李兰华、倪晓东和张玉琴被分配到食堂烧饭。对这些女孩子来说，一天要供应一百多人吃饭，真是一个很大的难题。开始的时候，一锅饭常常煮成三样——上边生、中间熟、下边糊。大伙吃得不好，议论纷纷，急得她们直哭。李兰华说：“在家怕当‘锅台转’，没想到到这儿来又围着锅台转，有啥意思？不干这个费力不讨好的‘锅台转’了。”正在这里参加劳动的“青少年之家”的一位老师，鼓励她说：“你这个‘转’与家庭的那个‘转’可不相同，那是小‘转’，这是大‘转’哪！”李兰华听了很受启发，对呀！哭有什么用，还是到毛主席著作里去找答案，学学《为人民服务》吧。几个姑娘凑到一块，边学边议，心里豁亮了。她们表示，为了保证生产，一定当好革命的大“锅台转”。有一次，倪晓东和炊事班的同伴，为了让大家吃上一顿炸油条，揉了十几个小面团，分别掺进不同比例的矾、碱、盐，放到油锅里一次又一次地试验，从傍晚忙到半夜十一点，油烟满屋，但炸出的“油条”还是又黑、又苦。别人劝她别试了。晓东不听，还坚持试验，一直忙到天明，到底让大伙吃上了又香、又好吃的油条。现在，她们做饭的技术样样都熟练了，饭菜做得可口，人人吃得满意。
    根子越扎越深
    八个月过去了，年轻人在劳动中，经受了风吹雨打。有的家庭一直在经济、感情上给他们一些不好的影响，但都被他们顶住了。虽然斗争刚刚开始，但是，革命的根子却越扎越深，大伙始终牢记当初立过的誓言：一心务农，革命到底。
    最近，一位女青年收到母亲一封信，信的大意是担心女儿受冻，劝她回家“猫一冬”。这位女青年马上写了回信，说：妈妈疼我的心情是可以理解的。但是，你的女儿为了革命的事业，为了人民的利益，怎能贪图个人的安逸？……
    女青年李淑琴，也在日记里作了这样的记述：不久前遇到“青少年之家”一些分配在牡丹江市内工作的同学，心里动了一下，但马上意识到干什么都是革命，自己走的也是革命的道路，决不能半途而废，一定要昂首阔步地走到底。
    在年轻人思想改造的斗争中，赵汝龙是比较突出的一个。这个二十三岁的青年，受资产阶级家庭的影响较深。一九六二年初中毕业到“青少年之家”后，曾分配他烧锅炉、修公路，但他怕脏，嫌低气，都没有干到底。当他这次和同伴一起到农场后，他的家庭曾多次动员他回去，说什么靠定息也能养活起他；还给他做料子服，经常寄糕点，但他都没有动摇。他表示，要听毛主席的话，接革命的班，决心在生产劳动中改造锻炼自己。八月份发大水，他带头冒雨趟渡急流，抢运垛在洼地上的羊草；秋收把手割破感染了，他还坚持干到底；打下的黄豆入库时，麻袋漏了，豆子撒到地上一点，他马上一粒粒地拣起来，说：“这是汗水换来的，一粒也不能丢。”如今，赵汝龙已经加入了共青团，并且被同伴选为小队长。
    年轻人都爱上这个革命的集体。每天，他们从起床唱到睡觉，一个月要开几次文娱晚会。他们一年四季，坚持进行民兵训练。
    他们在生活上互相体贴，女青年帮助男青年缝缝补补，男青年尽量不让女青年干重活。政治上互相关怀，人人要求进步，全队团员已由七名发展到二十三名，团的积极分子队伍已由七名扩大到五十六名。就连在家娇生惯养，饭后少不了一个苹果，外号叫“小苹果”的张玉琴，如今也能吃能干，学会了自己料理自己的事情。
    年轻人的眼光放宽了，看的更远了。他们身居茅舍，胸怀革命，正在制订发展生产的长远规划。有的青年因事偶尔回家一趟，总感到个人家庭的圈子太小。他们都说“牡丹江市的大楼虽美，却不如自己亲手盖的草房有感情；我们在这里，才是大有作为的地方，一定在这里扎根、开花、结果！”
