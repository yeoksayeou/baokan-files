    The class struggle in our commune is extremely complex. The nature of landlords and rich peasants will not change; they are constantly plotting to make trouble. After 1959, they were active everywhere, plotting sabotage. Some wrote reactionary slogans, others cursed in the streets. A controlled element stirred up trouble everywhere, saying: “Even real brothers cannot get along, how can so many people in the commune get along together? Communes have been a disaster.” They demanded “contracting production to the household,” and even wanted to “contract low yields.” They said: “‘Contracting low yields’ can increase individual production enthusiasm.” In essence, they were妄想妄想recovering their exploitation of the poor and lower-middle peasants and realizing capitalist restoration. At this time, right-leaning opportunists also believed the time had come and launched an attack on the Party Central Committee and socialism. They insulted the Party Central Committee in every way possible. Comrade Wu Han also thought the opportunity had arrived and actively wrote *Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor*. He desperately praised Hai Rui's spirit of daring to "scold." In essence, he was encouraging right-leaning opportunists to scold even more fiercely.

    Not written earlier, not written later, Comrade Wu Han wrote *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* to praise Hai Rui at a time when right-leaning opportunists were being removed from their posts. In essence, he was praising right-leaning opportunists who opposed the people's communes, advocated contracting production to the household, and pretended to represent the interests of the people. More importantly, *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* expressed sympathy for the right-leaning opportunists who had been removed from their posts, and encouraged them not to be discouraged. This further exposed Comrade Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist face.

    Landlords and bourgeois experts often use science and culture to wage class struggle against the proletariat and oppose socialism. When I started conducting scientific experiments in breeding, landlords and rich peasants said: "Agricultural scientific experiments are done by returned students, university students, professors, and experts. Your educational level is too low. They have crossed more bridges than you have walked roads. Don't waste your efforts." Those bourgeois experts also said: "Covered in mud and knowing nothing, what scientific research can you do?" The bourgeoisie wants to prevent us from mastering science so that they can monopolize science and use it as a tool to wage struggle against our proletariat. Under the leadership of the Party, it is entirely possible for us peasants to master agricultural science and promote our socialist construction. Bourgeois intellectuals like Comrade Wu Han want to deceive us by claiming we don't understand "academic" matters and use "academic" arguments to attack the Party and socialism. We firmly disagree and must thoroughly expose and criticize their reactionary political motives. We workers and peasants must overthrow their academic monopoly, master academic culture, and make academic pursuits serve the socialist cause.

    打倒资产阶级知识分子在学术上的垄断地位
    广东省新会县环城公社青年农民育种专家　邓炎棠
    我们公社里的阶级斗争形势非常复杂。地主、富农的本性是不会改变的，他们时刻想捣乱。一九五九年以后，他们到处活动，阴谋破坏，有的写反动标语，有的骂大街。有个管制分子就到处煽动破坏，他说：亲兄弟都无法合在一块，公社里这么多人，怎么合在一起。公社化是搞糟了。他们要求“包产到户”，而且要“包低产”。他们说：“‘包低产’可以提高个人生产积极性。”实质上是妄想恢复对贫下中农的剥削，实现资本主义复辟。这时，右倾机会主义分子也认为时机已到，发动了对党中央和社会主义的进攻。他们百般地辱骂党中央。吴晗同志也认为机会来了，积极活动，写了《海瑞骂皇帝》。他拼命表扬海瑞的敢“骂”精神。实质上就是鼓动右倾机会主义者骂得凶一点。
    早不写，晚不写，在右倾机会主义者被撤了职的时候，吴晗同志又写了《海瑞罢官》歌颂海瑞，实质上是歌颂反对人民公社、主张包产到户、冒充代表人民利益的右倾机会主义分子。更重要的是，《海瑞罢官》为被撤了职的右倾机会主义分子抱不平，鼓动他们不要泄气。这就更加暴露了吴晗同志反党反社会主义的面目。
    地主、资产阶级专家常常利用科学文化来同无产阶级斗争，反对社会主义。我开始进行育种科学试验时，地主富农说：“农业科学试验是留学生、大学生、教授、专家们搞的。你的文化水平太低。人家走的桥比你走的路还长，别白费心机了。”那些资产阶级专家也说：“泥巴一身什么都不懂，能搞什么科学研究？”资产阶级想阻挠我们掌握科学，以便他们垄断科学，把科学作为工具向我们无产阶级进行斗争。在党的领导下，我们农民完全有可能掌握农业科学，推动我们的社会主义建设。象吴晗同志这样的资产阶级知识分子，想欺我们不懂“学术”，利用“学术”来向党向社会主义进攻，我们坚决不答应，要彻底揭露、批判他们反动的政治目的。我们工人、农民一定要打倒他们在学术上的垄断地位，掌握学术文化，使学术为社会主义事业服务。
