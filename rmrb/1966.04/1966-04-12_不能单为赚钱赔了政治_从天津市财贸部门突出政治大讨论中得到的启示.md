    Editor's Note: Emphasizing politics on the financial and trade front, like emphasizing politics on other fronts, first and foremost means adhering to the socialist direction and opposing the capitalist direction. This is the biggest class struggle.

    The emphasis on political discussions in Tianjin's financial and trade departments shows that class struggle in the financial and trade sector is often manifested through specific, everyday business activities. Sometimes, the sale of a three-cent bottle stopper or a mothball is a struggle between socialist and capitalist business ideologies.

    When a thermos is no longer insulated, the customer thinks the glass liner is broken and wants to buy a new one. After inspection, the salesperson confirms that the liner is good but the stopper is faulty. Instead of selling him a liner worth more than one yuan, he sells him a three-cent stopper. This leads to a debate. Is it about being considerate of the customer and making a three-cent sale? Or is it about increasing sales volume and making a one-yuan sale? This is the crux of the matter.

    One can see the sun from a drop of water. From this three-cent sale, one can see the two directions of socialist and capitalist business practices. The financial and trade departments must strive to promote the development of the socialist economy, serve the people's lives, and also accumulate funds for the country. Therefore, we cannot simply measure the quality of work by the size of sales volume and the amount of profit. We must have a political yardstick for looking at problems, adhere to the socialist direction, oppose capitalist business ideologies, and not lose sight of politics just for the sake of making money.

    This emphasis on political discussions in Tianjin's financial and trade departments has further broadened people's horizons, allowing them to further understand the fundamental principle that emphasizing politics is the foundation of all work, from the vivid facts reflecting vivid thoughts.

    The Great Discussion Must Take Class Struggle as the Guiding Principle

    Currently, Tianjin's financial and trade departments are conducting the fourth major discussion on the issue of emphasizing politics.

    The three major discussions last year each yielded significant gains, and everyone's understanding of emphasizing politics gradually improved. However, the purely business-oriented viewpoint that neglects politics continues to manifest itself in new forms under new circumstances among many people.

    Leading comrades of Tianjin's financial and trade departments made the following analysis: Last year's three discussions addressed the relationship between politics and business. The first two times, because we did not tightly grasp the fundamental issue of class struggle to fully展开 (zhǎn kāi - expand) the discussion, many people did not fundamentally recognize the great significance of emphasizing politics. The third time, we focused on the questions of what road to take, what kind of team to build, and what kind of finance and trade to run, and raised the question of "whether to be a proletarian revolutionary or a bourgeois businessman," guiding everyone to understand the significance of emphasizing politics from the height of preventing and opposing revisionism. However, at that time, the various viewpoints on class struggle were not fully revealed, and the problem was still not well resolved. Many comrades have not yet linked emphasizing politics with class struggle and the struggle between the two roads.

    This is an important lesson. Politics is the struggle of one class against another. Only by fully understanding the reality of class struggle in socialist society can we fundamentally understand the significance of emphasizing politics; only by understanding that class struggle is the key link in all work can we fundamentally understand the principle that politics commands business.

    At the beginning of this year, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party clearly stated that the major discussion on emphasizing politics must take class struggle as the guiding principle. The fourth major discussion on emphasizing politics in Tianjin's financial and trade departments first discussed the issue of class and class struggle in the socialist period, starting from here to improve the consciousness of emphasizing politics.

    In this way, we have grasped the root of solving the problem of emphasizing politics. The broad masses of cadres, combining the study of Chairman Mao's discourses on class and class struggle, and linking them with the situation of class struggle in various fields such as politics, economy, and ideology in recent years, examined their ideological understanding, summarized their experiences and lessons, and contrasted the "sweetness" of emphasizing politics with the "bitterness" of not emphasizing politics. In this way, many people found the root cause of why they could not emphasize politics at all times and in all matters in the past, which was the ambiguity of the class struggle viewpoint; they realized that to emphasize politics, they must consciously grasp class struggle. Many comrades said: This time, I truly realized that whether or not to emphasize politics is a directional issue related to whether or not to make revolution and whether or not to take the socialist road.

    All work must take class struggle as the key link, and the major discussion on emphasizing politics is no exception. If in the discussion we only split hairs over nouns and delve into jargon, or only discuss the staffing of political organizations and political cadres, the specific methods of doing ideological work, or only argue about how to do that business on a case-by-case basis, without raising these issues to the height of class struggle to understand them, without criticizing the purely business-oriented viewpoint from the height of the struggle between the two roads, without analyzing the class struggle in real life, and without strengthening the concept of class struggle, then it is impossible to truly recognize the significance of emphasizing politics, it is impossible to defeat the purely business-oriented viewpoint, and it is impossible to overcome the tendency of not asking about politics.

    A Re-Education in Class Struggle

    The fourth major discussion was, first and foremost, a lively class struggle education lesson.

    The first stage of the discussion was conducted among cadres at the municipal and district levels. Even among these older cadres who had worked for a relatively long time, there were still many vague understandings of class struggle. Many people acknowledged the existence of class struggle in principle and in words, but did not see class struggle in their actual work.

    Is there still class struggle in units that have undergone the Socialist Education Movement? This was a topic of heated debate. Some people believed that after this movement, class struggle no longer existed.

    What is the actual situation? Comrade Zhang Zhi, Secretary of the Party Committee of Tianjin Department Store, introduced the situation there at a symposium we held.

    Comrade Zhang Zhi said: Our municipal company and two wholesale departments and one retail outlet concluded the Socialist Education Movement in July last year. The heads of these four units saw that many problems had been resolved, and assumed that there was no longer any class struggle in their units; if there were any, it would have to wait for a while and would not come immediately. Therefore, they concentrated their efforts on grasping business; doing some ideological work was only to boost the enthusiasm of the employees. But, is there really no class struggle? No. Most of the people who were found to have made mistakes in the movement can sincerely repent, but some have committed the same kind of mistakes again. There are also some individuals who have newly committed such mistakes. Bourgeois elements are still spreading the poison of capitalist ideas. Even in our municipal company, there have appeared two people who used their work authority to purchase scarce and popular goods at the grassroots stores. None of these four units is free from class struggle.

    These problems were not proactively discovered by us. Some were discovered when superiors sent people to inspect, and some were revealed by employees in the major discussion on emphasizing politics. Some problems, even if we discovered them, did not attract attention, and we did not seize them to educate everyone.

    Why turn a blind eye or not ask about class struggle?

    Comrade Zhang Zhi said: The fundamental reason is that our understanding of the long-term, complex, and repetitive nature of class struggle is insufficient. In fact, it is impossible for one movement to solve all problems. Some problems that are solved now may arise again in the future. The idea that class struggle can be done once and for all is fundamentally wrong. To consolidate the achievements of the Socialist Education Movement, we must adhere to taking class struggle as the key link, emphasizing politics at all times and in all matters, and grasping the revolutionization of people.

    Comrade Zhang Zhi's experiences are worthy of everyone's deep consideration.

    Having class struggle is not terrible, what is terrible is not seeing it and not grasping it. In this major discussion on emphasizing politics, a re-education in class struggle should be universally carried out. Increasing the concept of class struggle a bit will increase political consciousness a bit, and will strengthen the awareness of emphasizing politics a bit.

    Consciously Upholding the "Key Link" in "Small Matters"

    In the major discussion on emphasizing politics, Tianjin's financial and trade departments debated whether there is class struggle on the three-foot counter and in daily business activities. Now, many people have realized that the three-foot counter is also a battleground of class struggle, and there is class struggle in daily business activities. This kind of class struggle is largely manifested as the struggle between socialist and capitalist business ideologies and business styles. However, because this struggle is often reflected in specific and even small transactions, it is easy to slip past if one is not careful. So, how can we grasp the class struggle in daily business activities well? The practice of Huazhen Department Store is a useful reference.

    One afternoon in the autumn of last year, the department store group of Huazhen Department Store had an argument over a three-cent sale. The course of events was as follows: A customer brought a thermos and wanted to change the glass liner. The salesperson Zhao Yijiang took out the liner and conducted a careful inspection, and did not find any trace of cracking. Based on his many years of experience, he determined that the thermos was not insulated due to the stopper being not round and leaking air. He suggested that the customer buy a three-cent stopper to try. The customer adopted his suggestion and left happily. However, as soon as the customer left, there was an argument in the counter. Some people said: "If we do business like this, we will not be able to complete our sales task." Some people said: "When customers come to buy a liner, we should sell it to them." Some people also expressed different opinions, believing that Zhao Yijiang did the right thing, and that running socialist commerce cannot be purely for the purpose of completing sales tasks, without considering the interests of the masses, and even damaging the interests of consumers.

    The store's Party branch believes that there is a political issue and a class struggle issue in this three-cent matter. They seized this vivid example and organized employees to continue the debate, so that the purely business-oriented viewpoint that does not ask about politics was once again subjected to a forceful criticism.

    Class struggle manifested in sales of only a few cents is very easily overlooked. This requires store leaders to have a keen political sense, to constantly have a "gun" of class struggle in their minds, and to be good at seizing these seemingly "small matters" in a timely manner, raising them to the height of class struggle to deal with them correctly, and using them to educate employees.

    The Party branch of Huazhen Department Store is a political headquarters that can more consciously uphold the key link of class struggle in daily business activities. They often seize the issues that belong to the struggle between socialist and capitalist business ideologies, and promptly organize employees to conduct discussions, distinguish right from wrong, and draw clear lines. Each discussion is a struggle to "promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois," and each discussion is a socialist education.

    A controversy over a mothball is also an example.

    One day in the summer of last year, Sun Lihua, a young salesperson at Huazhen Department Store, in order to facilitate customers, divided the original 50-jin bags of mothballs into packs of one dime each, according to the customer's purchasing habits. At the end of the distribution, it was discovered that it was more than eight liang short, so he sought the opinion of the old salesperson Zhang Bosheng. Zhang Bosheng thought for a moment and said: "Let's do this, the original package should weigh one liang, eight qian, and five fen, you change it to one liang and eight qian, that is, put one less in each package. In this way, not only will there be no losses, but you can also increase four or five liang." Sun Lihua felt that something was wrong and hurriedly asked: "Isn't giving customers less weight damaging the interests of consumers?" Zhang Bosheng impatiently replied: "Customers don't care about a mothball, even if the customer wants to weigh it, no one can see if the scale is a little high or a little low." At this time, Ning Fulan, a member of the Communist Youth League, interjected: "I object to doing this! There is reasonable wear and tear for selling mothballs, which the superiors have stipulated long ago. Giving customers less weight is a capitalist business style." The two argued red-faced for more or less of a mothball. The store's Party branch believed that the matter was small but the significance was great, so it organized all employees to launch a special discussion on "What does the controversy over a mothball explain?" In the end, Zhang Bosheng also figured it out, examined his own thinking, and said: "Xiao Ning argued well. With such an argument, the lingering spirit of the old Huazhen capitalist attached to me was driven away."

    The old employee Zhang Bosheng's sentence vividly depicts the essence of the struggle between the two business ideologies and the two business styles. Capitalist business ideologies and business styles such as short measures are the lingering spirits of the overthrown bourgeoisie. It is still attached to some of our cadres and employees, making some of our socialist stores still tainted with capitalist filth. We must emphasize politics to drive away these lingering spirits, so that our commerce becomes a completely socialist commerce, and our commerce will always have proletarian politics as its soul. We cannot lose sight of politics just for the sake of making money!

    We Must Stink Out Selfish Ideas

    The generation and long-term existence of purely business viewpoints have many reasons in terms of understanding, which are being gradually resolved through discussion. As the discussion deepens step by step, people increasingly feel that individualistic selfish ideas are also a pillar of the purely business viewpoint. There are some people who disregard the political impact of business activities and blindly grasp indicators and pursue profits, saying in words: "Making more money does not go into my pocket, I have no personal plans." In fact, he wants to "show his hand" in business operations so that he can get benefits in the evaluation and promotion. This is still out of consideration for personal fame, gain, and status. In order to completely overcome the purely business viewpoint, we must not only solve the problem of understanding, but also educate cadres and employees to consciously clear away selfish ideas.

    Hong Yong, Secretary of the Party General Branch of Tianjin Dried and Fresh Fruit Company, made a self-criticism at a company cadre meeting not long ago. He not only examined his purely business viewpoint, but also examined his thinking of putting "fear" first and "I" at the center. This time, at a symposium convened by reporters, Comrade Hong Yong said: We have two problems in business operations: one is the "80% full" mentality, always afraid that too much fruit will rot and lose money; the other is the "three emphases and three neglects": emphasizing autumn fruits (apples, oranges, etc., high prices, relatively easy to operate), neglecting summer fruits (peaches, apricots, etc., low prices, easier to rot); emphasizing dried fruits, neglecting fresh fruits; emphasizing fruits from outside the province (mostly autumn fruits, large profits), neglecting fruits from within the province (mostly summer fruits, small profits). The reason is also fear of losing money, fear of rotting. Because of this kind of business thinking, some fruits, the producing areas hope to sell more, and consumers also need them, but we have not been very active in operating them. The relationship with some producing areas has not been handled well. These are all considering more about profit and loss, and less about supporting production and meeting the needs of the masses. This is a purely business viewpoint that does not ask about politics. Comrade Hong Yong said that in our fresh fruit industry, it is right to strive to avoid rotten fruits and losing money, prevent losses to the country, and strive to accumulate more construction funds for the country. However, why are we afraid of rotting and losing money to that extent? There are selfish ideas of personal individualism in here, which was originally afraid of being criticized by leaders or even punished after rotten fruit incidents and money losses occurred. Considering "I" too much and considering serving production and people's lives too little.

    To make a revolution against selfish ideas and stink them out, we must grasp the class struggle in people's minds. The communist ideology of being wholeheartedly for the revolution and everything for the revolution and the bourgeois individualism for fame and profit are often fighting in people's minds. This is class struggle in the ideological field. To emphasize politics, we must grasp the living study and application of Chairman Mao's works and promote the ideological revolutionization of people. As leading cadres, we must play a leading role in this regard.

    The Tianjin Financial and Trade leading organs summarized the experiences of several major discussions on emphasizing politics and came to the conclusion that the foundation of emphasizing politics is to take class struggle as the key link, to take the struggle between the two roads as the key link, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and to promote the ideological revolutionization of people. They also believe that whether or not this fundamental has been grasped is the watershed that distinguishes whether a unit or a leading cadre is truly emphasizing politics.

### 不能单为赚钱赔了政治——从天津市财贸部门突出政治大讨论中得到的启示

    不能单为赚钱赔了政治
    ——从天津市财贸部门突出政治大讨论中得到的启示
    编者按：在财贸战线上突出政治，跟其他战线突出政治一样，首先是坚持社会主义方向，反对资本主义方向。这是最大的阶级斗争。
    天津市财贸部门突出政治的大讨论表明，财贸部门的阶级斗争，往往是通过具体的、日常的业务活动表现出来的。有的时候，三分钱的瓶塞、一个卫生球的买卖，竟是社会主义经营思想同资本主义经营思想的斗争。
    暖水瓶不保温了，顾客认为是瓶胆坏了，想买一个新的。售货员经过检查，肯定瓶胆是好的，瓶塞有毛病，没有卖给他价值一元多钱的瓶胆，而卖给他一个只要三分钱的瓶塞。于是引起一场争论。是为顾客着想，作三分钱买卖呢？还是为营业额着想，作一元多的买卖呢？这就是问题的关键。
    从一滴水可以看太阳。从这个三分钱的买卖，可以看社会主义和资本主义两种经营方向。财贸部门要努力促进社会主义经济的发展，为人民生活服务，也为国家积累资金，所以不能简单地从营业额的大小和利润的多少，来衡量工作的好坏。我们看问题要有一个政治的尺子，坚持社会主义方向，反对资本主义经营思想，不能单为赚钱，赔了政治。
    天津市财贸部门这一次关于突出政治的大讨论，进一步打开了人们的眼界，使人们从活生生的事实反映出来的活生生的思想当中，进一步懂得了突出政治是一切工作的根本的道理。
    大讨论必须以阶级斗争为纲
    目前，天津市财贸部门正在进行关于突出政治问题的第四次大讨论。
    去年的三次大讨论，每一次都有不小的收获，大家对突出政治的认识逐步提高。可是，在不少人当中，忽视政治的单纯业务观点，总是在新的情况下，又以新的形式表现出来。
    天津市财贸部门的领导同志做了这样的分析：去年三次讨论了政治和业务的关系，前两次由于没有紧紧抓住阶级斗争这个根本性问题充分展开讨论，不少人没有从根本上认识突出政治的重大意义。第三次，我们着重提出了走什么道路、带什么队伍、办什么财贸的问题，提出了“是当无产阶级革命家，还是当资产阶级买卖人”的问题，引导大家从防止修正主义、反对修正主义的高度来理解突出政治的意义。但是当时对阶级斗争的各种观点还没有充分亮开，问题仍然解决得不够好。不少同志还没有把突出政治同阶级斗争、两条道路斗争挂上钩。
    这是一条重要的经验教训。政治就是阶级对阶级的斗争。只有充分了解社会主义社会阶级斗争的实际，才能从根本上理解突出政治的意义；只有懂得了阶级斗争是一切工作的纲，才能从根本上理解政治统帅业务的道理。
    今年年初，中共天津市委明确提出：突出政治大讨论，必须以阶级斗争为纲。天津市财贸部门关于突出政治的第四次大讨论，首先讨论了社会主义时期阶级和阶级斗争的问题，从这里入手来提高突出政治的自觉性。
    这样一来，就抓住了解决突出政治问题的根子。广大干部结合学习毛主席关于阶级、阶级斗争的论述，联系几年来政治、经济、思想等各个领域内阶级斗争的情况，检查思想认识，总结经验教训，对比突出政治的“甜头”、不突出政治的“苦头”。这样，许多人就找到了过去不能时时事事突出政治的根本原因，是阶级斗争观点模糊；认识到要突出政治，必须自觉地抓阶级斗争。不少同志说：这次我才真正认识到突出不突出政治，是关系到要不要革命、要不要社会主义的方向性的大问题。
    一切工作都要以阶级斗争为纲，突出政治的大讨论当然不能例外。如果在讨论中只是去抠名词，钻术语，或者仅仅去讨论政治机构和政治干部的配备、做思想工作的具体方法，或者只是就事论事地争论那笔生意该怎么做，而不把这些问题提到阶级斗争的高度去认识，不从两条道路斗争的高度去批判单纯业务观点，不去分析现实生活中的阶级斗争，不去加强阶级斗争的观念，那就不可能真正认识突出政治的意义，就不可能斗倒单纯业务观点，克服不问政治的倾向。
    来一次阶级斗争的再教育
    第四次大讨论，首先是上了一次生动的阶级斗争教育课。
    讨论的第一阶段是在市区级干部中进行的。就在这些工作时间比较长的老干部当中，对于阶级斗争还有不少模糊的认识。不少人原则上、口头上承认有阶级斗争，在实际工作中又看不到阶级斗争。
    经过社会主义教育运动的单位还有没有阶级斗争？这是热烈争论的一个题目。有些人认为，这次运动以后，阶级斗争就不存在了。
    实际情况如何呢？天津市百货公司党委书记张志同志在我们召开的座谈会上，介绍了他们那里的情况。
    张志同志说：我们市公司和两个批发部、一个零售门市部，在去年七月结束了社会主义教育运动。我们这四个单位的负责人看到问题已解决了不少，就以为本单位已经没有阶级斗争了；要有，也得过个时期，不会马上就来。于是，就集中力量抓业务；做点思想工作，也只是鼓鼓职工的干劲。可是，真的没有阶级斗争了吗？不。在运动中发现的犯了错误的人，大多数能痛改前非，但是也有人又犯同样性质的错误。也有个别人新犯了这类错误。资产阶级分子还在散布资本主义思想的毒素。就在我们市公司，也出现了两个利用工作职权到基层商店购买缺俏商品的人。这四个单位，没有一个不还存在着阶级斗争。
    这些问题，并不是我们主动发现的。有的是上级派人检查时发现的，有的是在突出政治大讨论中由职工揭发的。有的问题，我们发现了也没引起注意，没有抓住对大家进行教育。
    为什么对阶级斗争视而不见、见而不问呢？
    张志同志说：根本原因是我们对阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性、反复性认识不足。实际上，一次运动要解决所有问题是不可能的。有些问题现在解决了，今后还可能产生。那种认为阶级斗争可以一劳永逸的想法，是根本不对的。要巩固社会主义教育运动的成果，必须坚持以阶级斗争为纲，时时事事突出政治，抓好人的革命化。
    张志同志这些体会，值得大家深思。
    有阶级斗争并不可怕，可怕的是看不见，不去抓。在这次突出政治的大讨论中，应当普遍进行一次阶级斗争的再教育。增加一点阶级斗争的观念，就会提高一点政治觉悟，就会加强一点突出政治的自觉性。
    自觉地在“小事”上举“纲”
    天津市财贸部门在突出政治大讨论中，争论过在三尺柜台上、在日常业务活动当中有没有阶级斗争的问题。现在，许多人已经认识到，三尺柜台也是阶级斗争的阵地，日常业务活动中也有阶级斗争。这种阶级斗争，大量表现为社会主义和资本主义两种经营思想、两种经营作风之间的斗争。但是，由于这种斗争往往是在一笔笔具体甚至细小的交易上反映出来，不注意就容易滑过去。那末，怎样才能抓好日常业务活动中的阶级斗争呢？华贞百货商店的做法，是个有益的借鉴。
    去年秋季一天下午，华贞百货商店的百货组，曾为一笔三分钱买卖发生了一场争论。事情的经过是这样的：一位顾客拿来个暖水瓶，要换个瓶胆。售货员赵一江把瓶胆取出来，进行了细致的检查，没有发现一点破裂的痕迹。凭他多年的经验，断定这个暖水瓶不保温，是由于瓶塞不圆，漏气造成的。他建议顾客买个三分钱的瓶塞试试。顾客采纳了他的建议，高高兴兴地走了。可是，顾客一走，柜台里就争论起来了。有人说：“照这样做买卖，我们的销货任务没法完成。”有的人说：“人家顾客来买瓶胆，我们就应该卖。”也有人发表了不同的意见，认为赵一江做得对，办社会主义商业就不能单纯为了完成销售任务，而不为群众利益着想，甚至去损害消费者的利益。
    商店党支部认为：在这三分钱上，有政治问题，有阶级斗争问题。他们抓住这个活典型，组织职工继续辩论，使不问政治的单纯业务观点又受到了一次有力的批判。
    象这种在几分钱买卖上表现出来的阶级斗争，人们很容易忽视。这就需要商店领导者有敏锐的政治嗅觉，头脑中要经常有杆阶级斗争的“枪”，善于及时抓住这类表面看来的“小事”，提到阶级斗争高度去正确处理，并且用来对职工进行教育。
    华贞百货商店党支部，就是一个能够比较自觉地在日常业务活动中，高举阶级斗争之纲的政治指挥部。他们经常抓住属于社会主义和资本主义两种经营思想之争的问题，及时地组织职工开展讨论，分清是非，划清界限。每一次讨论都是一场“兴无灭资”的斗争，每一次讨论都是一次社会主义教育。
    一个卫生球的风波，也是一例。
    去年夏季的一天，华贞百货商店青年售货员孙立华为了方便顾客，把原装五十斤一袋的卫生球，按照顾客购买的习惯，分成一角钱一包。分到末了，发现亏了八两多，于是去找老业务员张博胜征求意见。张博胜稍加思索说道：“这么办吧，原来每包应重一两八钱五，你改称一两八，也就是每包里少放一个。这样，不但不会亏损，还可以升四五两。”孙立华觉得不对劲，忙问了一句：“给顾客少分量，不是损害消费者利益吗？”张博胜不耐烦地回答：“一个卫生球顾客也不在乎，即使顾客要过秤，头高头低谁也看不出来。”这时候，共青团员宁复兰接过来说：“这样做，我反对！卖卫生球有合理损耗，上级早有规定。给顾客少分量是资本主义经营作风。”为了多放少放一个卫生球的事，两人争得面红耳赤。商店党支部认为事小意义大，便组织全体职工开展了一场“一个卫生球之争说明了什么”的专题讨论。最后，张博胜也想通了，检查了自己的思想，并且说：“小宁争得好。这样一争，赶跑了附在我身上的旧华贞资本家的阴魂。”
    老职工张博胜的这句话，形象地描绘出两种经营思想、两种经营作风这一斗争的实质。象短斤少两这样的资本主义经营思想和经营作风，就是已被推翻的资产阶级的阴魂。它还附在我们一部分干部、职工身上，使我们一些社会主义商店还沾染着资本主义的污垢。我们突出政治，就要驱走这些阴魂，使我们的商业办成完完全全的社会主义商业，使我们的商业永远以无产阶级政治为灵魂。我们不能单纯为了赚钱，赔了政治！
    一定要把私心杂念搞臭
    单纯业务观点的产生和长时间存在，有很多认识方面的原因，正在通过讨论逐步解决。随着讨论步步深入，人们越来越感到，个人主义的私心杂念，也是单纯业务观点的一条支柱。有一种人，他们不顾业务活动的政治影响，一味去抓指标、追盈利，口头上说：“多赚钱也没有进自己的腰包，我没有个人打算。”实际上，他是想在业务经营上“露一手”，以便在评奖、提级的时候得到好处。这还是出于个人名利、地位等考虑。为了彻底克服单纯业务观点，既要解决认识问题，也要教育干部、职工自觉地去清除私心杂念。
    天津市干鲜果品公司党总支书记洪涌，不久以前在公司干部会上做了一次自我批评。他不仅检查了自己的单纯业务观点，还检查了自己“怕”字当头、“我”字当道的思想。这次，洪涌同志在记者邀集的座谈会上说：我们在业务经营上有两个毛病：一是“八成饱”思想，老怕果品进多了要烂，要赔；二是有“三重三轻”：重秋果（苹果、桔子等，价高，比较好经营），轻伏果（桃、杏等，价低，更容易烂）；重干果，轻鲜果；重省外（秋果多，利润大），轻省内（伏果多，利润小）。原因也是怕赔，怕烂。因为有这样的经营思想，有的果品，产地希望多销，消费者也需要，我们却没有很积极地去经营。同某些产地的关系，处理得也不够好。这都是考虑赔赚多，考虑支持生产、满足群众需要少。这就是不问政治的单纯业务观点。洪涌同志说，我们鲜果行业，努力避免烂果品、赔钱，防止给国家造成损失，力求多为国家积累建设资金，这是对的。但是，为什么怕烂、怕赔到那种程度呢？这里面就有个人主义的私心杂念，原来是怕出了烂果品的事件和赔了钱以后，要挨领导批评，甚至受处分。考虑“我”字多了，考虑为生产、为人民生活服务少了。
    革私心杂念的“命”，把私心杂念搞臭，就要抓人们思想里的阶级斗争。一心为革命、一切为革命的共产主义思想和为名为利的资产阶级个人主义，二者经常在人们的头脑里打架。这是思想领域内的阶级斗争。我们要突出政治，就要抓紧活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。作为领导干部，在这方面要起带头作用。
    天津市财贸领导机关综合几次突出政治大讨论的体会，得出这样的结论：突出政治的根本，是以阶级斗争为纲，以两条道路斗争为纲，活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。他们还认为，是不是抓住了这个根本，这是区别一个单位、一个领导干部是不是真正突出政治的分水岭。
