Editor's Note: All trades and professions must emphasize politics. All work must emphasize politics. Whether or not this can be achieved depends on whether the leading organs of all trades and professions emphasize politics. In the past, some comrades believed that business leading organs should only manage business, and that political work should be the responsibility of the local Party committee. This view must be changed. The political work of the financial and trade departments should be led mainly by the local Party committee, but the business leading organs must emphasize politics at all times and in all matters, and work together with the local Party committee to do a good job of political work. Only in this way can we ensure that the work of all departments adheres to the socialist direction, and can we better promote the ideological revolutionization of workers and the revolutionization of enterprises. Only in this way can we better complete business work.

This newspaper recently invited some comrades from the leading organs above the county level of the grain department to discuss the issue of how business leading organs can emphasize politics. Now, the record of the symposium is organized and published for comrades' reference. It is hoped that comrades from the leading organs at all levels of the financial and trade departments will continue to submit articles and letters to express their opinions on this issue.

Why Did Hard Tasks Become Soft Tasks?

Guo Jianmin, Director of the Grain Bureau of Yu County, Shanxi Province, said: To emphasize politics, we must first recognize the importance of emphasizing politics. According to our experience, to solve the problem of understanding the emphasis on politics, we must first seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant expositions. At the same time, we must seriously summarize experiences and lessons, summarize the hardships of not emphasizing politics, and summarize the benefits of emphasizing politics. Only in this way can we have a deeper understanding. In 1960, when we inspected our work, we found many problems in business management. At that time, we thought that this was caused by the strictness of the system and the incompleteness of the procedures. Therefore, we concentrated our efforts on grasping procedures and systems, but did not grasp politics. When we inspected our work in 1963, some problems became even more serious. In 1964, we seriously summarized these experiences and lessons, and then realized that grasping the system alone cannot solve the problem. To do a good job in business work, we must grasp ideological and political work.

Deng Liansheng, Director of the Grain Bureau of Longchuan County, Guangdong Province, said: In the past, we only grasped purchasing, sales, transfers, and storage, and ignored grasping politics, and suffered a lot. At that time, the capitalist management thinking of some employees was quite serious. For example, some people sold insufficient amounts of grain, which affected the relationship between the Party and the masses. Our purely business viewpoint also hindered our support for agricultural production. When the commune asked the comrades of the grain management station to go out to adjust good seeds, we were afraid of increasing expenses and did not reimburse travel expenses, so the comrades of the grain management station did not dare to go out. All this shows that without a political mind and without a class viewpoint, work will lose its direction. We summarized these lessons and emphasized implementing political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints in our work. Since the winter of 1964, we have actively and proactively cooperated with the agricultural departments to adjust good varieties of rice from other places. After the seeds were transported back, we also organized forces to remove barnyard grass and impurities, and invited representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants to appraise them. Last year, the county's rice fields increased production by more than 100 kilograms per mu, and good seeds played a significant role. The masses are very satisfied with this matter. After phenomena such as a few employees selling insufficient amounts of grain were overcome, the relationship between the masses and the grain department became closer. We have also tasted the sweetness of emphasizing politics from these things.

Ou Yinzh, Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of the Grain Bureau of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, said: Whether the business leading organs emphasize politics has a very large impact on whether the enterprise can emphasize politics. Why do the people below shout, "Business cannot stay overnight, but politics can stay until the New Year?" It is because we criticize them when the business plan is not completed well, but we turn a blind eye to the poor performance of political work. Why do the people below say, "Business work is a hard task, and political work is a soft task?" It is because we only grasp business, not politics. What is a soft task? What is a hard task? In the eyes of the comrades below, what the leadership grasps is what is hard. If we don't grasp it, what was originally a hard task becomes a soft task. Some comrades in our bureau used to make phone calls to the people below to ask for statistical figures, and they would say very clearly: "This is a hard task, don't delay it!" The comrades below had to complete this type of task day and night; for ideological and political work, because the superiors did not grasp it tightly, it was often postponed again and again. Furthermore, why have some problems of capitalist management thinking not been resolved in the past? This is also closely related to the words and deeds of our leading organs. For example, if the grain is sold with over-consumption (exceeding the prescribed loss index), the people below are asked to make a self-criticism. If it is raised in the warehouse, they often don't ask any questions. This creates a wrong impression below: "It is better to raise it than to consume it." Some people are afraid of over-consumption, so they give less to the masses. We often did not pay attention to this kind of political influence problem in the past, which contributed to the capitalist management style of the people below.

Li Shenzhi, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department of the Political Department of the Ministry of Grain, said: Any unit must emphasize politics, and business leading organs should emphasize the emphasis on politics even more. Because, first, business leading organs are often in contact with specific business, especially in the financial and trade departments, what they see and talk about every day are money, grain, commodities, indicators, and figures. If you don't pay attention, it is easy to only look at business and not at politics, and fall into a purely business viewpoint. Second, since it is an organ, it is easy to form an office-like style, and it is easy to sit in the office and handle affairs based on reports, procedures, and systems. This not only prevents yourself from going out, but also increases the burden on the grassroots. Third, since it is a leading organ, it must play a leading role. If you don't emphasize politics, it will be difficult for the people below to move. All this shows that business leading organs must emphasize the emphasis on politics. At the same time, we should also see that once the awareness of the comrades in the business leading organs is raised, once ideology and politics are put in command, because they have a thorough understanding of the problems in business and have more contact with the workers' active thinking, they are more likely to do political work in business work. The comrades of the business leading organs should make full use of their favorable conditions for doing political work and earnestly do a good job of political work.

The Key Lies in the Revolutionization of Leadership

How can we emphasize politics? The comrades who participated in the symposium unanimously believed that the key lies in the revolutionization of leadership.

Zhou Jinquan, Deputy Director of the Grain Bureau of Handan Prefecture, Hebei Province, said: Whether or not we can emphasize politics depends on the leading cadres, especially the number one leader, playing an exemplary role for the people below. Zhang Yongxiang, the Party Secretary and Director of our bureau, used to be said by comrades to "emphasize business and neglect politics," and he could not accept it. After studying Chairman Mao's expositions on political work, checking his thoughts against the criteria, and digging out the roots, he realized that the position of politics in his mind was not right. In February last year, a four-level cadre meeting was held for the heads of grain stations above the level of the whole prefecture. At the meeting, Comrade Zhang Yongxiang publicly examined his purely business viewpoint and the resulting bad consequences, analyzed and criticized the ideological roots of his emphasis on business and neglect of politics, and led the comrades in each county to compare the hardships and benefits and dig out the root causes of neglecting politics. This conference became the starting point for emphasizing politics in the grain system of Handan Prefecture.

Ou Yinzh said: According to our experience, for business leading organs to emphasize politics, it cannot simply be to establish political institutions, equip them with political cadres, and exchange some specific experiences in doing ideological and political work; nor can it just be "said on the mouth, posted on the wall," and add a few empty political terms when making reports and writing summaries; nor can it just be to call on others to do it and learn it. The important thing is that leading cadres and political cadres must be consistent in word and deed, and practice what they preach. One is that if you want others to emphasize politics, you must first emphasize politics at all times and in all matters. We often say that the people below have not put political work in its proper place, but in fact, it is often that we ourselves have not put it in the first place. Some leading comrades in our bureau have said many times: business is so busy, we have done a lot of political work, and we should grasp business. The other is that if you want to transform others, you must first transform yourself. In the second half of 1964, we equipped grassroots political cadres and summarized the "six hearts" experience of doing ideological work (patiently talking, understanding each other with heart, and sincerely caring), thinking that we could do a good job of ideological work. However, at that time, we did not emphasize that leading cadres and political cadres should take the lead in transforming their thinking and taking the lead in revolutionizing, so some political instructors only educated others. When he talked to the workers, the other party was not convinced: "Why are you always right?" Since last year, this approach has been changed. Many leading cadres and political cadres study Chairman Mao's works with the workers, take the lead in examining their thoughts, and fight against the word "I." When they educate others again, their words have power.

Deng Liansheng said: The so-called leaders grasping, grasping the leaders, is not just about us coming forward to grasp the leading backbone of the people below, but also about grasping ourselves well. These leading cadres of ours must consciously carry out ideological revolution. I did not pay attention to political work in the past, and I had this idea: I have never heard of being punished for not doing political work well, but if business work is not done well, I will be dismissed or notified. There is the word "I" in this, fearing that if the purchase, sale, transfer, and storage are not done well, I will be punished, I will be notified; however, I don't think much about the harm caused to the Party and the country by neglecting politics. In addition, in the past, my style was not democratic enough, and I had a "bureaucratic air." I could only criticize others, and I was unwilling to listen to others' criticisms. In this way, others will "respect and stay away," and we cannot confide in each other. How can we do a good job of ideological and political work? In the past, I did not sufficiently recognize the necessity of ideological transformation for myself. I thought that I had a good family background, a clean history, and I had not made any major mistakes in my work, and I had always been praised, so I didn't need to transform myself much. It was not until last year that I truly realized that I needed to study Chairman Mao's works well and constantly transform my thinking. I checked my problems with the comrades, and there have been some improvements in my ideological style. Now the work situation is different from the past.

Guo Jianmin said: The revolutionization of leadership also includes the issue of an organ's revolutionization. In 1964, after we realized that we could not lead work by procedures, systems, reports, and telephones, we greatly opposed complicated philosophy and streamlined procedures and reports. At the same time, the county bureau's original five sections and one office were merged into two offices for politics and business. In the past, everyone was trapped in the circle of affairs, and they spent less time going to the grassroots. Now, in general, only four people are left to persist in office work, and the other seven people squat at the grassroots level to promote the development of political work and business work. These reforms have also reduced the burden on the grassroots. For example, in the past, storage and transportation, statistics, and accounting each had a set of accounts, and they had to ask the people below for three sets of forms. Now, they work together in the same office, changed to a set of accounts, and only ask the people below for one set of forms. The grassroots units have more time to do ideological and political work.

The Central Link Is to Promote the Study of Chairman Mao's Works

What specific political work should business leading organs grasp? How should they grasp it? The comrades who participated in the symposium believed that due to the different enterprise management systems in various places, the methods of grasping can be adapted to local conditions. At present, the leadership of political work in grassroots enterprises is mainly led by the local Party committee in most areas; in a few areas, it is mainly responsible by the business leading organs under the leadership of the county (city) Party committee. No matter which situation, business leading organs must hold a positive attitude towards doing political work and have the spirit of "not shirking responsibility," and must not rely on avoidance. First, we must clearly understand that we must respect and obey the leadership of the local Party committee and rely on the local Party committee to strengthen political work. As for what work the business leading organs mainly grasp? Everyone believes that it is necessary to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works, grasp the implementation of the Party's policies and policies, grasp the cultivation and promotion of advanced models, carry out the "five goods" and "six goods" movements, and also grasp the universal active thinking, as well as training political cadres, etc. The central link is to do a good job of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way.

Zhou Jinquan said: For business leading organs to promote the study of Chairman Mao's works well, leading cadres must study more, study earlier, study ahead, and apply it ahead. Zhang Yongxiang, the Party Secretary of our bureau, is good at squeezing time and persists in studying Chairman Mao's works, making great efforts to transform his subjective world, and paying attention to using Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems when holding meetings, deploying work, and inspecting work. Because he took the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, it had a great impact on the comrades below. The comrades said: "The leadership has taken the lead in opening up the way for us, how can we not keep up!" When we grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works, we also paid attention to grasping the leading comrades of the county bureau. Among the fifteen counties and cities in the whole prefecture, the grain bureau chiefs of Daming, Linzhang, Feixiang, and other five counties and cities have already studied relatively well. In this way, with the leadership taking the lead at all levels, coupled with the leadership and promotion of the local Party committees of each county, a heat wave of studying Chairman Mao's works has formed in the grain system of the whole prefecture since last year.

Zhou Jinquan continued: Grasping typical examples, establishing pace-setters, and promoting advanced experience is an important method of promoting work. Without this, it will flow into general calls, and no work can be done well. An important method for us to grasp the study of Chairman Mao's works is to pay attention to cultivating and establishing study models on the basis of universal mobilization. After a period of cultivation in each county, we convened a meeting of activists in the grain system of the whole prefecture in June last year to study Chairman Mao's works, exchanged experiences with each other, and organized a part of the people to report to grain workers. Each county also used methods such as organizing study activists to "pair up" with other workers and holding small report meetings to give play to their role as backbone and leaders. Because the study emphasizes the need to transform the world outlook, establish the idea of doing business for the revolution, emphasize the need to take root in thought, implement it in action, and see results in work, and at the same time, the study and application of Chairman Mao's works are placed in the first place in the evaluation, this has promoted the emergence of a large number of advanced figures who study well, think well, and work well among the workers. At present, there are already 117 advanced figures in the grain system of the whole prefecture who have attended meetings of study activists above the county level.

Li Shenzhi said: Now, the vast masses have a high enthusiasm for studying Chairman Mao's works, and the leading organs must earnestly do a good job of organization and leadership, so that everyone can learn well. First, ideological implementation. It is necessary to often understand the ideological situation of the workers in the study, enlighten and consolidate the workers' learning consciousness. Second, organizational implementation. Party organizations at all levels should become the leading core of studying Chairman Mao's works, and administrative units at all levels should prepare study groups according to different situations such as the concentration and dispersion of personnel, so that workers have their own learning organizations. We can also set up study counselors to help each other learn. Third, time implementation. The leadership has already decided on the study time for financial and trade workers during working hours. All grassroots units must earnestly arrange to ensure that workers have time to study.

Putting Political Work into Business Work

Guo Jianmin said: For business leading organs to emphasize politics, they must use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything and put political work into all aspects of business work. When deploying tasks, we must explain the significance, explain the policies, and analyze the situation, both raising business indicators and raising political requirements. In the process of carrying out tasks, we must emphasize the implementation of policies, emphasize handling affairs according to the "three major viewpoints" (political viewpoint, production viewpoint, mass viewpoint), and emphasize doing ideological and political work. When inspecting work, we must first see whether politics is emphasized in business activities, whether policies are implemented, whether the political awareness of workers is raised, and whether the relationship between the Party and the masses is close. In the past, when we inspected whether the grain purchase work was fully completed, we only looked at whether the variety, quantity, and quality indicators were fully completed, but we did not check the policy implementation, which easily caused problems.

Zhao Ze, Director of the Political Department Office of the Hubei Provincial Grain Department, said: The Party's policies are the life of the Party, and the Party's policies are formulated based on Mao Zedong Thought. Correctly implementing the Party's policies is an important part of emphasizing politics. Some comrades believe that studying, publicizing, and implementing the Party's policies are not a content of emphasizing politics, which is wrong. The business leading organs of the grain department must put political work into business work, organize workers to study grain purchase and other policies well, and publicize these policies to the masses. In the process of work, we must carefully check the implementation of policies to ensure implementation.

Zhou Jinquan said: Business leading organs must put political work into business work, and emphasize politics everywhere and in everything. Meetings are a regular activity of business departments. Meetings must emphasize politics. Before 1964, in our place, because meetings were often only simply assigning tasks and allocating indicators, sometimes some people engaged in departmentalism, which led to quarrels and even the phenomenon of failure to transfer. In the past year or so, our meeting situation has been different. For example, when the transfer and transportation department holds a meeting, it first studies Chairman Mao's works and promotes the spirit of revolution. The phenomenon of arguing about varieties, quantities, and injury losses, which used to be prone to occur, is gone. In order to put political work into business work, business cadres and political cadres must cooperate well to avoid doing their own things. Our approach is to unify research and focus on different aspects of work. We require business cadres not only to start from politics when grasping business, but also to check the study of Chairman Mao's works and the ideological and political work when going down to work, and to report back. For political cadres, we require them to care about and understand business work, but not to take over administrative affairs. In order to emphasize politics at all times and in everything, it is necessary to mobilize the masses to do political work. We must rely on both the backbone and mobilize the vast masses. Some cadres do not believe that the general masses can do a good job of ideological and political work, and some workers also think that they cannot do ideological and political work. These views need to be educated and corrected.

    业务领导机关怎样突出政治
    粮食部门领导机关几位同志座谈突出政治的问题
    编者按：各行各业都要突出政治。一切工作都要突出政治。能不能做到这一点，关键在于各行各业的领导机关是否突出政治。过去，有些同志认为，业务领导机关只管业务，政治工作应由地方党委负责。这种看法必须改变。财贸部门的政治工作，应当以地方党委的领导为主，但是业务领导机关必须时时事事突出政治，和地方党委共同做好政治工作。这样，才能保证各个部门的工作坚持社会主义方向，才能更好地促进职工的思想革命化和企业的革命化。也只有这样，才能更好地完成业务工作。
    本报最近邀请粮食部门县以上领导机关的一些同志，座谈了业务领导机关怎样突出政治的问题。现在，将座谈记录整理发表，供同志们参考。希望财贸部门各级领导机关的同志继续来稿来信，就这个问题发表意见。
    为什么硬任务变成了软任务？
    山西省盂县粮食局局长郭建民说：要突出政治，首先要认清突出政治的重要意义。根据我们的体会，要解决关于突出政治的认识问题，首先要认真学习毛主席的有关论述。同时，要认真地总结经验教训，总结不突出政治的苦头，总结突出政治的甜头。这样才能认识得更深刻。一九六○年，我们检查工作的时候，发现经营管理中有不少问题。当时，我们以为这是制度不严，手续不全造成的。于是，集中力量狠抓手续、制度，却没有抓政治。到一九六三年检查工作的时候，有的问题反而更严重了。一九六四年，我们认真总结了这些经验教训，才认识到光抓制度不能解决问题。要做好业务工作，必须抓思想政治工作。
    广东省龙川县粮食局局长邓连胜说：过去，我们只抓购、销、调、存，忽视抓政治，吃了不少苦头。那时候，有的职工资本主义经营思想相当严重。例如，有人卖粮食分量不足，影响了党和群众的关系。我们的单纯业务观点，也妨碍了对农业生产的支援。公社让粮管所的同志出外调剂良种，我们怕增加开支，不给报销旅差费，粮管所的同志就不敢出去了。这都说明，没有政治头脑，没有阶级观点，工作就会迷失方向。我们总结了这些教训，强调在工作中贯彻政治观点、生产观点和群众观点。从一九六四年冬天起，我们就积极主动地配合农业部门到外地调剂水稻良种。种籽运回来，还组织力量除稗，除杂，邀请贫下中农代表来鉴定。去年全县稻田每亩增产一百多斤，良种起了不小作用。群众对这件事情很满意。少数职工卖粮食分量不足等现象克服以后，群众跟粮食部门的关系更密切了。我们从这些事情中也尝到了突出政治的甜头。
    河北省唐山市粮食局党委副书记欧荫之说：业务领导机关是不是突出政治，对于企业能不能突出政治有非常大的影响。为什么下面喊“业务不能过夜，政治可以过年”？就因为我们见到下面业务计划完成得不好就批评，对于政治工作做得不好却不闻不问。为什么下面说“业务工作是硬任务，政治工作是软任务”？就因为我们只抓业务，不抓政治。啥叫软任务？啥叫硬任务？在下面的同志看来，领导上抓什么，什么就是硬的。不抓，本来是硬任务也成了软任务。我们局里有的同志过去打电话跟下面要统计数字，就说得很明白：“这可是硬任务，你别给耽误了！”下面的同志对于这类任务，起早贪黑也得完成；对于思想政治工作，由于上面抓得不紧，往往一拖再拖。再说，资本主义经营思想，有些问题为什么过去解决不了？这也跟我们领导机关的言行有很大关系。例如，卖粮食超耗（超过规定的损耗指标）就让下面做检讨，升库，涨出来了，往往就不加过问。这就使下面形成一种错觉：“升了比耗了强。”有人怕超耗，就少给群众。对于这种政治影响问题，我们过去常常不注意，就助长了下面的资本主义经营作风。
    粮食部政治部宣传部副部长李慎之说：任何单位都要突出政治，业务领导机关更要强调突出政治。因为，第一、业务领导机关经常接触具体业务，特别在财贸部门，天天看的、谈的都是钱，粮，商品，指标，数字。一不注意，就很容易只看业务，不看政治，陷入单纯业务观点。第二、既然是个机关，就容易形成机关化的作风，容易坐在上面办公，靠报表、手续、制度办事。这样，既妨碍自己走出门去，又给基层增加了负担。第三、既然是领导机关，就要起带头作用。你不突出政治，下面就很难动得起来。这些都说明，业务领导机关非强调突出政治不可。同时，我们也应该看到，业务领导机关的同志一旦觉悟提高了，一旦思想上政治挂了帅，由于他们对业务中的问题摸得比较透，对职工的活思想接触比较多，他们也就比较容易把政治工作做到业务工作中去。业务领导机关的同志应当充分利用自己做政治工作的有利条件，切实去做好政治工作。
    关键在于领导革命化
    怎么样才能突出政治？参加座谈的同志一致认为，关键在于领导革命化。
    河北省邯郸专署粮食局副局长周金泉说：能不能突出政治，关键在于领导干部，特别是第一把手，要对下面起表率作用。我们局的党组书记兼局长张永祥同志，过去同志们说他“重业务，轻政治”，他还接受不了。经过学习毛主席关于政治工作的论述，对照着查思想，挖根子，认识到政治在自己头脑里摆的位置不对。去年二月间，开了个全专区粮站主任以上四级干部大会。张永祥同志在会上公开检查了自己的单纯业务观点和造成的恶果，分析批判了自己重业务、轻政治的思想根源，带动各县的同志也纷纷对比苦头甜头，挖忽视政治的病根子。这次大会，成了邯郸专区粮食系统突出政治的起脚点。
    欧荫之说：根据我们的体会，业务领导机关要突出政治，不能仅仅是建立起政治机构，配备上政治干部，交流点做思想政治工作的具体经验就算完事；也不能只是“说在嘴上，贴在墙上”，在做报告、写总结的时候，“穿靴戴帽”地加几句空洞的政治名词；也不能只是号召别人去做，去学。重要的是领导干部、政治干部要言行一致，身体力行。一条是，要别人突出政治，首先自己要时时、事事突出政治。我们常说下面没有把政治工作摆上位置，实际上往往是我们自己首先没有摆上。我们局里有的领导同志就多次说：业务这么忙，政治工作抓了不少了，该抓抓业务了。另一条是，要改造别人，首先要改造自己。一九六四年下半年，我们配备了基层政治干部，总结了做思想工作的“六心”经验（耐心谈心，以心知心，真心关心），以为可以做好思想工作了。可是，当时没有强调领导干部和政治干部要带头改造思想，带头革命化，因此有的政治指导员只是教育别人。当他找职工谈话的时候，对方就不服气：
  “什么也是你好？”去年以来，改变了这种做法。许多领导干部、政治干部跟职工一起学习毛主席著作，带头检查思想，跟“我”字斗。他们再教育别人，说话就有力量了。
    邓连胜说：所谓头头抓，抓头头，不是光要我们出面来抓下面的领导骨干，还要我们把自己抓好。我们这些领导干部要自觉地进行思想革命。我过去不重视政治工作，就有这样一个想法：从来没有听说政治工作做不好要受处分的，但是业务工作做不好，不撤职也被通报。这里边就有个“我”字，怕购销调存搞不好，我受处分，我被通报；但是，对于忽视政治给党和国家造成的危害就不大考虑。另外，过去我的作风不够民主，有“官架子”，只能我批评人家，不愿意听别人批评。这样，别人对你“敬而远之”，彼此不能交心，怎么能做好思想政治工作呢？过去，我对自己思想改造的必要性认识不足，认为自己出身成份好，历史清白，工作中没犯过大错误，一贯受表扬，就不太需要改造了。直到去年，才真正认识到需要好好学习毛主席著作，不断改造自己的思想。我向同志们检查了自己的问题，思想作风上有了一些改进，现在工作情况就跟过去不同了。
    郭建民说：领导革命化，还包括一个机关革命化的问题。一九六四年，我们认识到不能靠手续、制度、表报、电话领导工作以后，就大反烦琐哲学，精简手续、表报。同时，把县局原来的五股一室，合并为政治、业务两个办公室。过去，大家陷在事务圈子里，到基层去的时间少。现在，一般只留四个人坚持机关工作，其余七个人到基层蹲点，推动开展政治工作和业务工作。经过这些改革，也减轻了基层的负担。如原来储运、统计、会计各有一套账，就得向下面要三套表。现在，合署办公，改成一套账，只向下面要一套表。基层单位就有更多的时间做思想政治工作了。
    中心环节是推动毛主席著作的学习
    业务领导机关做政治工作，具体抓些什么？怎么个抓法呢？参加座谈的同志认为，由于各地的企业管理体制不同，抓法可以因地制宜。目前，基层企业政治工作的领导，多数地区，以地方党委为主；少数地区，在县（市）委领导下，主要由业务领导机关负责。不管在哪种情况下，业务领导机关对于做政治工作，必须抱着积极的态度，要有“当仁不让”的精神，不能依赖推脱。首先还要明确认识，一定要尊重和服从地方党委的领导，依靠地方党委来加强政治工作。至于业务领导机关主要抓哪些工作？大家认为，要抓毛主席著作的学习，抓党的方针政策的贯彻，抓培养和推广先进典型，开展“五好”、“六好”运动，还要抓带普遍性的活思想，以及训练政治干部等。而中心环节是抓好活学活用毛主席著作。
    周金泉说：业务领导机关要推动好毛主席著作的学习，领导干部就要多学一些，早学一些，学在头里，用在头里。我们局的党组书记张永祥同志善于挤时间，坚持学习毛主席著作，在改造主观世界方面狠下功夫，在开会、布置工作、检查工作的时候，都注意运用毛主席思想解决现实问题。由于他这样带头活学活用毛主席著作，对下面的同志影响很大。同志们说：“领导上带头给我们趟开了路子，我们还能不紧紧跟上！”我们抓毛主席著作的学习，也注意抓县局的领导同志。全专区十五个县、市，现在已经有大名、临漳、肥乡等五个县、市的粮食局长，学习得比较好。这样领导层层带头，加上各县地方党委的领导推动，从去年以来，全专区粮食系统学习毛主席著作形成了热潮。
    周金泉接着说：抓典型，树标兵，推广先进经验，是推动工作的一个重要方法。没有这一条，就会流于一般号召，什么工作也做不好。我们抓毛主席著作学习的一条重要方法，就是在普遍发动的基础上，注意培养和树立学习标兵。在各县经过一段时间的培养以后，我们在去年六月份，召开了全专区粮食系统学习毛主席著作的积极分子会议，互相交流了经验，并且组织一部分人向粮食职工作了报告。各县也通过组织学习积极分子同别的职工“结对子”、举行小型报告会等方式，发挥他们的骨干、带头作用。由于在学习中强调要改造世界观，树立为革命做生意的思想，强调要思想上扎根，行动上落实，工作上见效，同时在评比中把活学活用毛主席著作放在首位，这就促使职工中涌现出大批学习好、思想好、工作好的先进人物。现在，全专区粮食系统出席过县以上学习积极分子会的先进人物，已经有一百一十七人。
    李慎之说：现在，广大群众学习毛主席著作的积极性很高，领导机关要切实做好组织领导工作，让大家都能学好。一是思想落实。要经常了解职工学习中的思想情况，启发和巩固职工的学习自觉性。二是组织落实。各级党组织要成为学习毛主席著作的领导核心，各级行政单位要根据人员集中、分散等不同情况，编好学习小组，使职工们都有自己的学习组织。还可以设立学习辅导员等，互相帮助学习。三是时间落实。财贸职工在工作时间内的学习时间，领导上早已定下来了。各基层单位要切实安排，保证职工有时间学习。
    把政治工作做到业务工作中去
    郭建民说：业务领导机关要突出政治，就必须用毛泽东思想统帅一切，把政治工作做到业务工作的各个方面。在布置任务的时候，就要讲清意义，交代政策，分析形势，既提业务指标，又提政治要求。在执行任务过程中，要强调贯彻政策，强调按“三大观点”（政治观点、生产观点、群众观点）办事，强调做思想政治工作。在检查工作的时候，首先要看是否在业务活动中突出了政治，执行了政策，是否提高了职工的政治觉悟，密切了党和群众的关系。过去，我们检查征购工作是否全面完成任务，仅仅看是不是全面完成了品种、数量、质量指标，而不检查政策执行情况，这就容易发生问题。
    湖北省粮食厅政治部办公室主任赵泽说：党的政策是党的生命，党的政策是根据毛泽东思想制订的。正确执行党的政策，是突出政治的重要部分。有的同志认为学习、宣传和贯彻执行党的政策，不是突出政治的一个内容，这是不对的。粮食部门的业务领导机关要把政治工作做到业务中去，就要组织职工学习好粮食征购等政策，并且把这些政策宣传到群众中去，在工作过程中要认真检查政策执行情况，保证贯彻执行。
    周金泉说：业务领导机关必须把政治工作做到业务中去，处处事事都要突出政治。开会是业务部门一项经常的活动。开会就必须突出政治。一九六四年以前，我们那里，由于开会往往只是单纯地分配任务，分配指标，有时候有的人就闹本位主义，以致发生争吵，甚至出现调拨不动的现象。这一年多，我们开会的情况就不同了。例如调运科开会，先学毛主席著作，提倡发扬革命风格，过去容易出现的那种争品种、争数量、吵伤耗的现象就不见了。为了把政治工作做到业务中去，业务干部和政治干部要很好配合，避免各搞各的。我们采取的办法是：统一研究，工作各有侧重。我们要求业务干部不仅抓业务要从政治出发，而且在下去工作的时候，先要检查毛主席著作的学习情况和进行思想政治工作的情况，回来都要汇报。对于政治干部，我们要求他们关心和了解业务工作，但是不要包揽行政事务。为了做到时时事事突出政治，需要发动群众人人做政治工作。既要依靠骨干，又要发动广大群众。有的干部不相信一般群众能做好思想政治工作，有的职工群众也认为自己做不了思想政治工作。这些看法都需要教育纠正。
