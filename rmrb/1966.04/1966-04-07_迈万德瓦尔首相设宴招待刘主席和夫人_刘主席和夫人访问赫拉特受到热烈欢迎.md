    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 6th -- Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife visited Herat, the third largest city in Afghanistan, on the morning of the 6th and were warmly welcomed by the Herat Provincial Government, the Herat Municipal Government, and the local people. They returned to Kabul on the afternoon of the 6th.

    Herat Provincial Governor Mir Aminuddin Ansari hosted a luncheon at the Herat Hotel to welcome Chairman Liu and his wife.
    As Chairman Liu and his wife drove into the city, more than 50,000 citizens and villagers wearing white, gray, and other colored turbans and astrakhan hats stood on both sides of the road, warmly applauding to welcome them. Arches adorned with Afghan and Chinese flags, draped in red cloth, and bearing "Welcome" slogans were erected along the ten-kilometer road from the airport to the city. Some welcomers climbed onto trees or the roofs of cars to get a better view of the Chinese guests. People on bicycles and motorcycles sped along the sidewalks to catch up with the motorcade.
    Chairman Liu and his entourage visited the Friday Mosque. This mosque, which can accommodate 80,000 people, is one of the largest mosques in the world. It was built more than 760 years ago and has been rebuilt several times since. The magnificent and exquisite architecture left a deep impression on visitors. Almost the entire exterior of the building is inlaid with colorful bricks and tiles, presenting a beautiful picture in the sunlight.
