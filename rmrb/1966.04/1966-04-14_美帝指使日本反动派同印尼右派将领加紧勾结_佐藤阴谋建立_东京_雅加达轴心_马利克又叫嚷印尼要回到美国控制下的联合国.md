    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th - News: Under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese Sato government is stepping up its collusion with the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique, plotting to establish a "Tokyo-Jakarta axis."

    According to an article published in the pre-released May issue of the Japanese magazine "Jiyu," the Sato government is gloatingly discussing the new idea of establishing a "Tokyo-Jakarta axis" with the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique, believing that Japan has "plenty of room for activity" with Suharto.

    The article said that the Japanese ruling clique had "watched the Indonesian coup drama with eagerness and excitement." During the performance of the Indonesian right-wing generals' seizure of power, relevant information "converged to the Japanese government through various channels." As soon as the Sato government saw that Suharto's military system was almost able to stand its ground in the turbulent situation in Indonesia, it immediately decided to give it millions of dollars in emergency assistance. The article believes that the "speed of this action by the Sato government is very different from its usual procrastinating manner."

    The article also said that now, in accordance with the wishes of the United States, "the decision-making power on Japan's policy towards Indonesia is completely controlled by Prime Minister Sato directly."

    This article also revealed that the Japanese ruling clique is stepping up its collusion with the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique out of political and economic ambitions to expand into Indonesia. The article said that Japanese monopoly capital is "salivating" over Indonesia's "almost inexhaustible human and material resources."

    The "Asahi Shimbun" reported on the 13th that the Japanese authorities believe that Japan should not only provide "economic assistance" to the Suharto and other right-wing generals' clique, but also provide "support" in the current foreign policy, in order to promote Indonesia's resolution of "returning to the United Nations, disputes with 'Malaysia' and improving Indonesia's relations with the United States" and other issues.

    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 13th - News: Adam Malik, the Foreign Minister in the cabinet controlled by the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique, said in a recent interview with Japanese reporters that Indonesia would step up its collusion with the Japanese Sato government, a running dog of the United States in Asia, and reiterated that Indonesia would return to the U.S.-controlled United Nations.

    According to Radio Jakarta's broadcast on the 11th, Malik said in a recent interview with Japanese reporters in Jakarta: "By strengthening political, economic and cultural ties [between Indonesia and Japan], cooperation between the two countries can be promoted." Malik said, "The Indonesian government will do its best to restore economic and trade relations with Japan. The economic and trade relations between the two countries used to be very good, but they have only been interrupted recently. Indonesia will try to remove the obstacles blocking this relationship."

    According to earlier reports, Japan has provided the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique with "emergency assistance" of 47 million US dollars since the September 30th Incident. After the establishment of the new anti-communist cabinet in Indonesia, the Japanese Ambassador to Indonesia, Saito, notified Malik on the 5th that the Japanese Sato government had decided to provide Indonesia with 2.5 million US dollars in "emergency economic assistance." In order to please the Sato government, Indonesia has sent "observers" to participate in the so-called "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" held in Japan.

    Malik also said in an interview with Japanese reporters that Indonesia would send an economic delegation to Japan. "The purpose of the delegation is to solve the economic problems between the two countries. Indonesia uses this approach to understand the possibility of Japan providing economic assistance, and such news has already come out from the Japanese side."

    Regarding the issue of Indonesia's return to the United Nations, Malik said: "Indonesia is still a member of many specialized agencies of the United Nations and Indonesia will try to rejoin." When asked whether Indonesia would use the reorganization of the United Nations as a condition for returning to the United Nations, Malik said: "This is not a condition, but the reason why Indonesia withdrew from the United Nations." He also said: "Anyway, you can see the new developments in this issue due to the steps to be taken by the new government."

    美帝指使日本反动派同印尼右派将领加紧勾结
    佐藤阴谋建立“东京—雅加达轴心”
    马利克又叫嚷印尼要回到美国控制下的联合国
    新华社十三日讯　东京消息：在美帝国主义的指使下，日本佐藤政府正加紧勾结印度尼西亚右派将领集团，阴谋建立“东京—雅加达轴心”。
    据提前出版的日本《自由》杂志五月号发表的文章透露，佐藤政府正在得意洋洋地谈论着同印度尼西亚右派将领集团建立“东京—雅加达轴心”的新设想，认为日本对苏哈托“大有进行活动的余地”。
    文章说，日本统治集团曾经“怀着急切期待而又兴奋的心情，注视印度尼西亚的政变戏剧”。在印度尼西亚右派将领篡夺政权的演出过程中，有关情报“通过种种途径汇集到了日本政府手里。”佐藤政府在印度尼西亚动荡不定的局势中，刚一看到苏哈托的军事体制差不多可以站住脚跟，就立即决定给它数百万美元的紧急援助。文章认为，佐藤政府这种行动的“速度之快，是同它平素办事拖沓的情况大不相同的”。
    文章还说，现在，秉承美国的意旨，“日本对印度尼西亚政策的决定权，完全由首相佐藤直接掌握”。
    这篇文章还透露了日本统治集团加紧勾结印度尼西亚右派将领集团是出于政治上和经济上向印度尼西亚扩张的野心。文章说，日本垄断资本对印度尼西亚的“几乎是无穷尽的人力和物质资源”，“垂涎欲滴”。
    《朝日新闻》十三日报道说，日本当局认为，日本对于苏哈托等右派将领集团不但要给予“经济援助”，而且要在当前的外交政策方面给以“支援”，以便推动印度尼西亚解决“回到联合国、同‘马来西亚’的纠纷和改善印度尼西亚同美国的关系”等问题。
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：在印度尼西亚右派将领集团控制的内阁中担任外交部长的阿达姆·马利克在最近对日本记者发表的谈话中，表示印度尼西亚将加紧同美国在亚洲的走卒日本佐藤政府的勾结，并且重申印度尼西亚将回到美国控制下的联合国。
    据雅加达电台十一日广播，马利克最近同在雅加达的日本记者谈话时说：“通过加强（印度尼西亚同日本的）政治、经济和文化联系，就可以促进两国的合作。”马利克说，“印度尼西亚政府将尽力恢复同日本的经济和贸易关系。两国的经济和贸易关系过去很好，只是最近才中断。印度尼西亚将设法清除阻塞这种关系的障碍。”
    据早些时候的报道，在九月三十日事件以来，日本已经向印度尼西亚右派将领集团提供了“紧急援助”四千七百万美元。在印度尼西亚成立新的反共内阁以后，日本驻印度尼西亚大使斋藤在五日通知马利克，日本佐藤政府已决定给予印度尼西亚二百五十万美元的“紧急经济援助”。为了讨好佐藤政府，印度尼西亚已经派“观察员”参加了日本召开的所谓“东南亚开发部长会议”。
    马利克在对日本记者的谈话中还说，印度尼西亚将派遣一个经济代表团到日本去。“代表团的目的是为了解决两国间的经济问题。印度尼西亚通过这一途径来了解日本提供经济援助的可能性，而且日本方面已经传出这种消息了。”
    关于印度尼西亚回到联合国的问题，马利克说：“印度尼西亚仍旧是联合国许多专门机构的成员而且印度尼西亚将设法重新参加”。当被问到印度尼西亚是否以联合国改组作为回到联合国的条件的时候，马利克说：“这不是条件，而是印度尼西亚退出联合国的理由。”他还说：“不管怎么样，你可以看到由于新政府将采取的步骤而在这个问题上出现的新的事态发展。”
