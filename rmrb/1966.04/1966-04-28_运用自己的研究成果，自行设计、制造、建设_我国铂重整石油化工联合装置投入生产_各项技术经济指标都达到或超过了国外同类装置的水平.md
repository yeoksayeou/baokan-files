    Using our own research results, independently designing, manufacturing equipment, and constructing
    China's Platinum Reforming Petrochemical Complex Goes into Production
    All technical and economic indicators reach or exceed the level of similar foreign facilities
    Xinhua News Agency, April 27th – The platinum reforming petrochemical complex, completely utilizing China's own research results, designed and manufactured equipment by ourselves, and constructed by ourselves, was completed and put into production in December of last year.  Since the complex went into production, its operation has been excellent, producing qualified products, and all technical and economic indicators have reached or exceeded the level of similar foreign facilities.
    The platinum reforming petrochemical complex is mainly used to produce high-purity benzene compounds.  With this complex, a large amount of raw materials can be provided for the production of pesticides, synthetic fibers, dyes, and other products, which is of great significance for the comprehensive utilization of petrochemicals.
    The catalyst used in this complex is also manufactured by China itself. The effect of its use proves that it has good performance, low consumption, large processing capacity, and high product purity.
    This complex was built and put into production under the close cooperation of more than one hundred units, fully embodying the superiority of socialist large-scale collaboration. The process equipment of this complex is advanced, the level of automation is high, the construction speed is fast, and the investment is also relatively low. The cost of the entire complex is more than 50% lower than importing from abroad.
    This complex is creatively built by the petroleum industry workers of our country, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. All personnel involved in the research, design, construction, production, and higher education aspects of the construction of this complex, put politics first and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works. In the absence of complete data and information, they solved a series of technical problems based on the characteristics of China's crude oil, quickly mastered new process technologies and operating rules, and achieved successful commissioning at one time. After testing in production, it has been proven that the design of the complex is reasonable, the project quality is excellent, and the production capacity and product yield have met the design requirements.

    运用自己的研究成果，自行设计、制造、建设
    我国铂重整石油化工联合装置投入生产
    各项技术经济指标都达到或超过了国外同类装置的水平
    新华社二十七日讯　完全运用我国自己的研究成果，自己设计、自己制造设备、自己施工建设的铂重整石油化工联合装置，已在去年十二月建成投入生产。这种联合装置投入生产以后，运转情况十分良好，生产出了合格的产品，各项技术经济指标都达到或超过了国外同类装置的水平。
    铂重整石油化工联合装置，主要是用来生产高纯度苯类。有了这种装置，就可以为生产农药、合成纤维、染料等产品，提供大量原料，对发展石油化工综合利用有重要意义。
    这套装置采用的催化剂，也是我国自己制造的，使用效果证明性能好，用量少，处理量大，产品纯度高。
    这套装置，是在一百多个单位的紧密配合下建成投入生产的，充分体现了社会主义大协作的优越性。这套装置的工艺设备先进，自动化水平高，建设速度快，投资也比较省。整个装置所花的费用，比从国外进口要节省百分之五十以上。
    这套装置，是我国石油工业职工高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬自力更生的革命精神，创造性地建成的。参加这套装置建设的研究、设计、施工、生产和高等院校等各方面的人员，突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作。他们在没有完整资料和数据的情况下，根据我国原油的特性，解决了一系列的技术难题，迅速地掌握了新的工艺技术和操作规律，做到了投产一次成功。经过生产的考验，证明装置的设计是合理的，工程质量是优良的，生产能力和产品收率都达到了设计要求。
