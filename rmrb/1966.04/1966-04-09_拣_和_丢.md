    "Picking Up" and "Discarding"
    Liberation Army Unit　Liu Shuchen
    In the nationally renowned Yutian Grain Depot, there's a small incident: A newly transferred lab technician was sweeping the storage yard and saw a kernel of corn on the ground. He casually picked it up, then "thwack," tossed it far away. When warehouse keeper Wu Ruihua saw this, he hurried over to pick up the kernel of corn. The new lab technician glanced at Wu Ruihua, smiling dismissively, as if to say, "Isn't that a bit petty?" Another warehouse keeper, Hu Zemin, said to her sternly: "A kernel of corn is produced by the peasants, each drop of sweat splitting into eight. It's national wealth, and we can't waste it carelessly." Later, after constant education from the veteran workers, the lab technician understood the significance of cherishing grain and truly achieved a state of "valuing grain like gold." Whenever she saw grain falling in the yard, even if it was just a millet grain, she would quickly pick it up.
    This story illustrates the principle very clearly: If one's thinking isn't elevated, the corn kernels "picked up" will be carelessly "discarded"; if one's thinking is elevated, then grain will be cherished like gold, and "a single grain of grain weighs a thousand pounds."
    This incident reminds me of the "picking up" and "discarding" in the production increase and economy practice movement. "Picking up," picking up discarded things, is one aspect of increasing production and practicing economy. Many units have consistently carried out this activity and achieved encouraging results. But upon further reflection, there is also a problem here: Why is there always something to "pick up"? That's because someone is always "discarding" things. "Picking up" is caused by "discarding," and "discarding" is the root of "picking up." Therefore, to promote production increase and economy practice, we must advocate "picking up," but even more so, we must advocate not "discarding."
    To advocate not "discarding," we must address the living thoughts behind the word "discard." If the "discard" mentality in our minds isn't thrown away, it's impossible to avoid "discarding" in action. For example, some people feel that: anyway, things belong to the public, it doesn't hurt to discard a little; others think that: small things, neither gold nor silver, are insignificant, and so on. With such thoughts, how can we plug the loopholes of "discarding"? Therefore, whether we advocate "picking up" or advocate not "discarding," we must grasp living thoughts and start by raising ideological awareness and enhancing ideological consciousness. Just like the Yutian Grain Depot, emphasize explaining revolutionary feeling and reason: "Picking up" is not just "picking up" one or two items; more importantly, it "picks up" good ideas of diligence and thrift; "Discarding" is not just "discarding" a small amount of things; more importantly, it "discards" the glorious tradition of hard struggle.

### “拣”和“丢”

专栏：增产节约杂谈

    “拣”和“丢”
    解放军某部　刘书忱
    在全国闻名的玉田粮库，有这样一件小事：一个新调来的化验员打扫货场，见到地上有一颗玉米粒，便随手拣起来，又“啪”地一声，弹出老远。保管员吴瑞华见了，赶忙跑过去把玉米粒拣起来。这位新化验员看了吴瑞华一眼，轻视地笑了笑，意思是说，这样也未免太小气了。另一位保管员胡泽民对她严肃地说：“一颗玉米粒，也是农民一个汗珠摔八瓣生产出来的，这是国家财富，不能随便糟踏着玩。”后来，经过老职工的不断教育，这位化验员懂得了爱惜粮食的意义，真是做到了“惜粮如金”的地步。她只要见到院子里掉下了粮食，哪怕是个谷子粒，也赶忙拣起来。
    这个故事，把这个道理真是说得一清二楚了：思想不提高，“拣”起来的玉米粒，会漫不经心地“丢”掉；思想提高了，便惜粮如金，“一粒粮食千斤重”。
    这件事，使我联想到增产节约运动中的“拣”和“丢”。“拣”，把丢掉的东西拣回来，这是增产节约的一个方面。许多单位持续地开展这一活动，取得了可喜的成绩。但细想一下，这里边也有个问题：为什么老有东西可“拣”呢？那是因为老有人“丢”东西。“拣”是“丢”引起的，“丢”是“拣”的根子。所以，搞增产节约，要提倡“拣”，更要提倡不“丢”。
    要提倡不“丢”，就要解决“丢”字后面的活思想。思想上的“丢”字没扔掉，想行动上不“丢”是不可能的。如有的人觉着：反正东西是公家的，丢点也不心疼；还有的人认为：小东小西，非金非银，微不足道，等等。有这样的思想，怎能堵住“丢”的漏洞？所以，不管是提倡“拣”还是提倡不“丢”，都要抓活思想，从提高思想认识和提高思想觉悟入手。象玉田粮库那样，重视讲革命的情和理：“拣”，不只是“拣”回了一两件东西，更主要的是“拣”回了勤俭节约的好思想；“丢”，不仅是“丢”掉了一点什物，更主要的是“丢”掉了艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。
