    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 7th—Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Liu Shaoqi, delivered a speech at the Kabul citizens' welcome rally on the 7th. The full text is as follows:
    Respected Prime Minister Mohammad Hashim Maiwandwal, Respected Mr. Mayor, Dear Citizens of Kabul:
    Three days ago, you warmly welcomed us as if celebrating a festival. That moving scene is unforgettable. Today, you are holding another grand gathering, giving us the opportunity to meet the citizens of Kabul. We express our heartfelt gratitude for your kindness. I would like to take this opportunity to convey the Chinese people's fraternal greetings and respect to the Afghan people.
    The Afghan people love independence and freedom. You have repeatedly defeated the armed invasions of imperialism and have never bowed your heads before the invaders. In the years when most Asian and African countries were enslaved by colonialism, you always maintained your independence. Your heroic deeds in defending national independence are the glory of the Afghan people and also the glory of the Asian and African people.
    The Afghan people are hardworking and intelligent people. You have created a brilliant culture in history. Today, you are working hard to change the face of your country. Under the leadership of His Majesty the King, Afghanistan has made many achievements in developing its national economy and national culture. The ancient Afghanistan is appearing on the Asian continent with a new posture.
      Afghanistan and China have always been good neighbors and good friends. As early as two thousand years ago, the famous "Silk Road" connected the people of our two countries. In history, there have never been any disputes between the people of our two countries, only friendly records.
      Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, our traditional friendship has undergone new developments. We have always respected each other and treated each other as equals. We both hate the oppression of imperialism in the past. We are determined not to treat each other with that unequal attitude. We are engaged in sincere cooperation in economic and cultural fields. We have amicably resolved the border issue. We have signed a treaty of friendship and non-aggression, affirming in legal form the determination of the people of the two countries to be friendly.
    In the past ten years or so, no matter what great storms have occurred in the international arena, the friendship between our two peoples has always developed. Such a friendship that can stand the test is a valuable friendship. Let the people of our two countries work together to develop this friendship for a long time to come!
    Our Asian and African countries are all faced with the arduous task of developing national economies and getting rid of poverty and backwardness. In the construction cause, the Chinese people have adopted the principle of self-reliance and have achieved some successes. However, to make our country truly prosperous and strong, we still need to make long-term and arduous efforts. Our Asian and African countries have hardworking and intelligent people and abundant resources. The Chinese people have learned from their own experience that as long as we make full use of these favorable conditions, an independent and self-reliant national economy can be developed, and the poverty and backwardness caused by long-term plunder by imperialism can be changed.
    Self-reliance in construction does not exclude international cooperation, and it first requires us to exchange what we have and support each other among Asian and African countries. China's current economic and technological level is not high. However, we believe that it is our bounden duty to provide economic assistance to Asian and African countries within our capabilities. When we provide assistance, we strictly respect the sovereignty of the recipient country, never attach any conditions, and never demand any privileges. We oppose using aid for control and plunder. The purpose of our assistance is to help the recipient country gradually embark on the road of self-reliance. Through this kind of assistance, Asian and African countries gradually strengthen the strength of their national economies, which is beneficial to the Asian and African people's cause of unity against imperialism, and it is also support for the Chinese people. Regarding assistance as a unilateral gift, and thinking that one is superior once assistance is provided, is a bad great-power chauvinistic attitude, and we resolutely oppose it.
    Dear friends, the people of our two countries have made outstanding contributions to ancient culture. Today, in terms of national construction, as long as we strive to become stronger, we will definitely be able to do what others can do, and we will do it even better. Of course, Asian and African countries will still encounter many difficulties and obstacles on the road to independent development, but our future is bright. In order to oppose imperialism and neo-colonialism, and to promote the cause of independence and progress of Asian and African countries, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Afghan people and with the people of other Asian and African countries, support each other and fight together.
    Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Afghan people!
    Long live Asian-African solidarity!
    Long live world peace! (Attached picture)

    刘少奇主席在喀布尔市民欢迎会上讲话
    中阿两国人民友谊总是发展的经得起考验的
    亚非国家在独立发展道路上还会遇到不少困难和障碍但是我们的前途是光明的
    新华社喀布尔七日电中华人民共和国主席刘少奇七日在喀布尔市民欢迎会上讲话，全文如下：尊敬的穆罕默德·哈希姆·迈万德瓦尔首相阁下，尊敬的市长先生，亲爱的喀布尔市民们：
    三天前，你们象庆祝节日一样，热烈地欢迎我们。那种动人的场面，令人难忘。今天，你们又举行盛大的集会，使我们有机会同喀布尔市民们见面。对于你们的盛情，我们表示衷心的感谢。我愿意借这个机会，向阿富汗人民转达中国人民兄弟般的问候和敬意。
    阿富汗人民热爱独立和自由。你们多次打败了帝国主义的武装进攻，从来没有在侵略者面前低过头。在大多数亚非国家受到殖民主义奴役的年代里，你们始终保持了自己的独立。你们捍卫民族独立的英雄事迹，是阿富汗人民的光荣，也是亚非人民的光荣。
    阿富汗人民是勤劳智慧的人民。你们在历史上创造了光辉灿烂的文化。你们今天又在为改变自己国家的面貌而努力。在国王陛下的领导下，阿富汗在发展民族经济和民族文化方面取得了许多成就。古老的阿富汗正在以新的姿态出现在亚洲大陆。
      阿富汗和中国从来就是好邻居，好朋友。早在两千年以前，著名的“丝绸之路”就把我们两国人民联系起来。在历史上，我们两国人民之间从来没有任何争执，只有友好的记载。
      自从两国建交以来，我们的传统友谊又有了新的发展。我们一直是互相尊重，平等相待。我们都痛恨帝国主义过去对我们的欺压。我们决心不用那种不平等的态度相互对待。我们在经济和文化方面进行真诚的合作。我们友好地解决了边界问题。我们签订了友好和互不侵犯条约，把两国人民决心友好的意志，用法律的形式肯定了下来。
    十几年来，不管国际上出现什么大风大浪，我们两国人民的友谊总是发展的。这样经得起考验的友谊，是可贵的友谊。让我们两国人民共同努力，把这种友谊长久地发展下去！
    我们亚非国家都面临着发展民族经济、摆脱贫穷落后的艰巨任务。中国人民在建设事业中，采取以自力更生为主的方针，取得了一些成就。但是，要使我们的国家真正富强起来，还需要进行长期、艰苦的努力。我们亚非国家都有勤劳智慧的人民，都有丰富的资源。中国人民从自己的切身经验体会到，只要我们充分利用这些有利的条件，独立自主的民族经济是可以发展起来的，帝国主义长期掠夺所造成的贫穷落后状态是可以改变的。
    自力更生地进行建设，并不排除国际合作，而且首先需要在我们亚非国家之间互通有无，互相支援。中国今天的经济技术水平还不高。但是，我们认为，在我们的能力范围以内，向亚非国家提供经济援助，是我们应尽的义务。我们提供援助的时候，严格尊重受援国的主权，绝不附带任何条件，绝不要求任何特权。我们反对利用援助进行控制和掠夺。我们提供援助的目的，是要帮助受援国逐步走上自力更生的道路。亚非国家通过这种援助，逐步加强民族经济的力量，这有利于亚非人民团结反帝事业，这也是对中国人民的支援。把援助看成是单方面的恩赐，提供了援助就认为高人一等，这是一种恶劣的大国沙文主义态度，我们坚决反对。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们两国人民曾经对古代文化作出过杰出的贡献。今天，在国家建设方面，只要我们奋发图强，别人能够做到的事，我们也一定能够做到，而且会做得更好。当然，亚非国家在独立发展的道路上还会遇到不少困难和障碍，但是，我们的前途是光明的。为了反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，促进亚非国家的独立和进步事业，六亿五千万中国人民将永远同阿富汗人民站在一起，同其他亚非国家的人民站在一起，相互支持，共同奋斗。
    中阿两国人民友好万岁！
    亚非团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
