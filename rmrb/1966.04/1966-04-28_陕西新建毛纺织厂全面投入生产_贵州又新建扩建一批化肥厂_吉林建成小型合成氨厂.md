    Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, April 27th. Shaanxi's newly built No. 1 Wool Textile Mill has recently become fully operational.
    This wool textile mill is a modern textile dyeing and finishing enterprise with both worsted and woolen series. It can produce worsted fabrics such as gabardine and valitin, as well as woolen fabrics such as overcoating, uniform cloth, and blankets, with an annual output of more than 1.6 million meters. It is one of the large-scale wool textile mills in the Northwest region.
    All the technological equipment of this wool textile mill is domestically produced, with a relatively high degree of automation and production efficiency.
    The Northwest is one of the main wool-producing areas in China. In recent years, wool textile mills in the Northwest region have used local fine wool to produce various woolen fabrics needed by people of all ethnic groups. In the trial production of Shaanxi No. 1 Wool Textile Mill, the gabardine and serge woven with Xinjiang fine wool were of good quality. Since the factory was partially put into production, it has trial-woven more than 70 different varieties of woolen fabrics.
    Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, April 27th. A number of newly built and expanded fertilizer factories in Guizhou Province have recently been put into production. They can produce more than 60,000 tons of fertilizer annually.
    In the past two years, the production of the fertilizer industry in Guizhou has greatly developed. Now, the fertilizer production capacity here has increased more than 20 times compared with 1963. Most of the special districts (autonomous prefectures) and cities in the province have established medium and small-sized fertilizer factories. These factories were established based on the principles of using local materials, producing locally, and supplying locally.
    Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, April 26th. Jilin Province's first newly built small synthetic ammonia plant has recently been completed and put into production. This small synthetic ammonia fertilizer plant is built in Jiaohe County, one of the main grain-producing areas in Jilin Province, and can provide 20,000 tons of ammonium bicarbonate chemical fertilizer for agriculture every year.
    Ammonium bicarbonate is a nitrogen fertilizer that has a good effect on increasing crop yields after application.
    This small synthetic ammonia plant was designed by the Jilin Provincial Local Industry Research Institute based on the national standardized design. The equipment was also manufactured by fraternal factories in the country. The entire production process is mechanized and continuous. During the construction process, the factory received strong support from more than a dozen state-owned large factories such as Jilin Fertilizer Factory, Jilin Chemical Machinery Factory, and Jilin Chemical Construction No. 1 Company, thereby accelerating the construction speed, improving the quality of the project, and achieving construction and commissioning in the same year.

    陕西新建毛纺织厂全面投入生产
    贵州又新建扩建一批化肥厂  吉林建成小型合成氨厂
    新华社西安二十七日电　陕西新建的第一毛纺织厂最近全面投入生产。
    这座毛纺织厂是拥有精梳和粗梳两大系列的现代化纺织染整全能企业。它既能生产精梳华达呢、凡立丁等织物，又能生产粗梳大衣呢、制服呢和毛毯等织物，年产量一百六十多万米，是西北地区大型毛纺织厂之一。
    这座毛纺织厂的全部工艺装备都是国产的，自动化程度和生产效率都比较高。
    西北是我国羊毛的主要产地之一。近年来，西北地区各毛纺织厂利用本地的细羊毛，已生产出各种各样供各族人民需要的毛织品。陕西第一毛纺织厂在试生产中，用新疆细羊毛织出的华达呢和哔叽，质量很好。这个厂从部分投入生产以来，已经试织出七十多种不同品种的呢绒。
    新华社贵阳二十七日电　贵州省又有一批新建和扩建的化肥工厂在最近投入生产。它们每年能生产六万多吨化肥。
    近两年来，贵州化肥工业生产有了很大的发展。现在，这里的化肥生产能力比一九六三年增长了二十多倍。全省大部分的专区（州）、市都建立了中小型化肥工厂。这些厂都是本着就地取材，就地生产，就地供应的原则建立起来的。
    新华社长春二十六日电　吉林省新建的第一座小型合成氨厂已在最近建成并投入生产。这座小型合成氨化肥厂建设在吉林省主要产粮区之一的蛟河县，每年可以为农业提供化学肥料碳酸氢铵两万吨。
    碳酸氢铵是一种氮素肥料，农作物施用后有很好的增产效果。
    这座小型合成氨厂是吉林省地方工业研究所在国家定型设计的基础上设计出来的，设备也是国内兄弟厂制造的，生产流程全部机械化、连续化。在建设过程中，这个厂得到了吉林肥料厂、吉林化工机械厂、吉林化工建设第一公司等十几个国营大厂的有力支援，因而加快了建设速度，提高了工程质量，做到了当年建设，当年投产。
