    The most fundamental condition
    The Jiuba, Shiba, and Yanzhibao brigades of the Heiquan Commune in Gaotai County are close to the desert, with strong winds, drought, and poor natural conditions. In 1952, they responded to the Party's call and resolved to plant trees and create forests on the wind and sand line. Some people opposed this, saying that trees could not survive in sandy depressions. Later, after in-depth ideological work by the Party branch and repeated practice by the masses, everyone established the determination not to give up until they had conquered nature. Relying on the strength of the collective, they planted trees and created forests on the dry beach along the edge of the desert, persisting for thirteen years and achieving great results.
    The *Gansu Daily* published a short commentary saying: When it comes to planting trees and creating forests, some people emphasize poor natural conditions, such as drought and lack of rain, strong winds and abundant sand, lack of seedlings, etc., and they are unable to make up their minds and achieve results. Now, the example of the three brigades of the Heiquan Commune provides a counterpoint to those arguments for inaction.
    Of course, there must be certain conditions for doing anything, and planting trees and creating forests is no exception. However, people with different mental states have different views on conditions. Looking at conditions with a static, metaphysical view, conditions seem to be fixed and unchangeable; looking at conditions with a developing, dialectical view, conditions can be created and are constantly changing. Facts have proven that if you create conditions yourself, the conditions will become better and better. When the three brigades of the Heiquan Commune started planting trees and creating forests, nature did not give them any good conditions, but they did not succumb to these unfavorable factors, and gradually created conditions in the struggle, so that forestry production continued to develop.
    The facts of the three brigades of the Heiquan Commune show that highlighting politics and using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle is the most fundamental condition. With this fundamental condition, establishing the idea of planting trees for the revolution and planting trees for the people, one will be brave enough to overcome unfavorable factors and create favorable conditions; without this fundamental condition, even if there are good natural conditions, they cannot be fully utilized.

### 最根本的条件

    最根本的条件
    高台县黑泉公社九坝、十坝、胭脂堡三个大队，靠近沙漠，风大，干旱，自然条件很不好。一九五二年，他们响应党的号召，决心在风沙线上植树造林。有人起来反对这样做，说沙窝里栽不活树。后来，经过党支部深入的思想工作和群众的反复实践，大家树立了不斗倒老天不罢休的决心，依靠集体力量，在沙漠边沿的干滩上植树造林，十三年来坚持不懈，取得了很大的成绩。
    《甘肃日报》发表短评说：一提起植树造林，有些人就强调自然条件不好，比如干旱缺雨，风大沙多，没有苗木，等等，老下不了决心，做不出成绩。现在，黑泉公社三个大队的事例，为那些无所作为的论点树立了对立面。
    当然，办任何事情都要有一定的条件，植树造林也是一样。可是，对待条件，具有不同精神状态的人有不同的看法。用静止的形而上学的观点看条件，条件似乎是固定的，不可改变的；用发展的辩证的观点看条件，条件是可以创造的，是在不断变化的。事实证明，自己去创造条件，条件就会越来越好。黑泉公社三个大队在开始植树造林时，大自然并没有给予他们什么好的条件，但是他们没有慑服于这些不利因素，并在斗争中逐步创造了条件，使林业生产不断得到发展。
    黑泉公社三个大队的事实说明，突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，这是最根本的条件。有了这个根本的条件，树立了为革命种树，为人民种树的思想，就会勇于去克服不利因素，创造有利的条件；如果没有这个根本的条件，即使有再好的自然条件，也不能充分利用起来。
