    Today, the song "Beijing-Tirana" resounded throughout Beijing. Hundreds of thousands of people in the capital took to the streets, with strong and profound proletarian internationalist feelings, to pay tribute to the Albanian Party and government delegation headed by Comrade Mehmet Shehu, and to the heroic people of the "Land of Eagles."
    The grand welcome by hundreds of thousands of people is unprecedented in Beijing. Colorful flags, flowers, and slogan arches adorned the city. The smiling faces of millions and the earth-shaking songs poured the most sincere feelings onto the Albanian brothers and comrades-in-arms who stand at the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism. This is the feeling of 650 million people, a symbol of the ironclad unity between the two parties, two countries, and two peoples of China and Albania.
    What friendship can compare to the fighting proletarian friendship forged through the trials and tribulations of stormy seas? The cheers and slogans bursting from the welcoming masses were earth-shattering. People waved colorful silks and the national flags of China and Albania, shouting "Long live the great and militant friendship between the people of China and Albania!" "Resolutely oppose U.S. imperialism, the number one enemy of the people of the world!" "Resolutely and thoroughly oppose modern revisionism!" The will expressed by this million-strong contingent is a fighting review, a demonstration to imperialism and modern revisionism.
    The welcoming procession stretched for twenty-five li. On both sides of the highway from the airport to the city, on the streets and in the alleys, and on the windows of all tall buildings, welcoming crowds gathered. Literary and artistic groups composed of thousands upon thousands of people sang and danced. Countless red flags, garlands, and ribbons, complementing the festive attire of the girls, made the city even more vibrant. In the majestic Tiananmen Square, nearly forty literary and artistic groups danced the dances of various Chinese ethnic groups, a chorus of over 1,400 people sang majestic songs, and a welcoming crowd of hundreds of thousands of people gathered around the square, enthusiastically cheering and jumping. Comrade Shehu, accompanied by Comrade Zhou Enlai, Comrade Kape, accompanied by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and Comrades Kellezi and Nase, accompanied by Comrade Chen Yi, rode in open-top cars, passed through the colorful lanes of people, circled Tiananmen Square, and received the welcome of the people. The leaders of the two parties and two countries of China and Albania frequently waved to the welcoming masses from the open-top cars, and people shouted with passionate "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Comrade Enver Hoxha!" The open-top car passed through this long welcoming procession, which took a full forty minutes, with seas of people everywhere, and climaxes everywhere.
    On the way from the airport to the city, more than 700 members of the China-Albania Friendship People's Commune gathered along the roadside, beating gongs and drums, welcoming the distinguished guests as if they were welcoming relatives. The commune members excitedly said, "We've been waiting day after day, month after month, and finally our relatives have arrived!" Some girls worked tirelessly overnight, some old men and women came with their children, and when the cars carrying the distinguished guests passed in front of them, the commune members shouted, "Long live the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people!" Zuo Xiuqin, a commune cadre who had visited Albania, specially wore a commemorative badge from the Albanian Revolution Museum on her chest today. She excitedly said, "A year ago, Comrades Hoxha and Shehu cordially asked about the production of our commune. Today, we met Comrade Shehu at our doorstep. How much we hope that Comrade Shehu can come to our commune as a guest!" Guo Suqing, a "Five-Good" commune member, said: "The Albanian people have set a good revolutionary example for us. Whenever we encounter difficulties in production, we think of the Albanian people's indomitable spirit of not fearing the strong. This revolutionary spirit encourages us to keep moving forward."
    The distinguished guests entered the Nankou area of Jianshe Road outside the city and met the welcoming crowd head-on. Nearly 40,000 workers, students, and street residents gathered here. More than 1,000 amateur artists dressed in colorful costumes danced and sang "Socialism is Good" under a colorful arch. More than 300 female students formed a flower bed here, waving flowers and cheering in unison: "Welcome! Welcome!" Comrade Shehu waved his hands in the car, greeting the welcoming masses. Among the workers' ranks here was Liu Yunsheng, a worker from the Third Team of the Fifth Workshop of the Beijing Chemical Plant, an advanced collective in Beijing in studying Chairman Mao's works. He said that their collective was determined to learn from the Albanian people's spirit of not fearing difficulties and constantly revolutionizing, and warmly welcomed Comrade Shehu's visit to our country. Liu Yunsheng said, "The common struggle against imperialism and modern revisionism closely links the hearts of the Chinese and Albanian people. The Albanian people's persistence in revolutionary struggle under the encirclement of imperialism and modern revisionism is our greatest support and encouragement."
    After the distinguished guests entered the urban area, an extremely warm scene appeared. From Jianguomen to Wangfujing, tens of thousands of children and tens of thousands of amateur art lovers formed a huge dance team and "ribbon area." Some workers and students also used hundreds of large and small drums to form a "drum group." When the distinguished guests passed by, the drums were deafening and the momentum was magnificent.
    In Tiananmen Square, there was an unprecedentedly grand scene. Here, the Chinese people's most sublime feelings for the Albanian brothers gathered. Today, palace lanterns hung high on the Tiananmen Gate Tower, and the fighting songs of China and Albania were broadcast through the loudspeakers. The entire square was like a hundred flowers blooming, simply dazzling. Here, a chorus of more than 1,400 people, accompanied by a large orchestra of hundreds of people, sang the song "Beijing-Tirana" in both Chinese and Albanian. On the reviewing stands on both sides of the Tiananmen Gate Tower, thousands of students used flowers to form the patterns of the national flags of China and Albania. On the reviewing stand, there were also huge slogans composed of Chinese and Albanian characters: "Warmly welcome Comrade Shehu." In the center of the square, a giant flower basket hung high in the air, and more than 6,000 literary and artistic workers joyously danced seventeen colorful ethnic dances. The Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture Cultural Troupe from Sichuan Province, which was performing in Beijing, did not sleep well last night and rushed to welcome the distinguished guests early this morning. They welcomed their close comrades-in-arms with a unique ethnic-style Yi dance. They said that we must tell the Yi people the moving scenes of welcoming the Albanian comrades that we saw with our own eyes today. The hearts of our Yi people are connected with the Albanian people forever, just like the hearts of the people of the whole country.
    Among today's welcoming crowd were teams from the People's Liberation Army's army, navy, air force and public security forces. Dressed in new military uniforms, they were full of energy and shouted welcoming slogans. Huang Rusheng and Yu Zhaoyu, who won first-class merit in the naval battle that sunk the U.S.-made Chiang warships "Jianmen" and "Zhangjiang" last year, also came to welcome the distinguished guests today. Huang Rusheng is the squad leader of battle hero Mai Xiande. He excitedly said, "The Albanian people and army can withstand great storms and waves and are reliable. Today, I came to welcome Chairman Shehu with the feeling of learning from the heroic people and heroic army. We will always stand with the fraternal Albanian people and fight to the end against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism." Opposite the welcoming team of the People's Liberation Army was the capital's militia team. They held high the flags of the militia divisions and regiments and cheered to the distinguished guests in unison. Some female militia members recited a poem they created for the reporter: "Albania's comrades-in-arms are here! The mountains cheer, the seas applaud, and all the people of Beijing welcome them to the streets! The demons and monsters tremble in fear and roll away far away!"
    Today, among the tens of thousands of welcoming people, many street residents also brought their old and young to the streets. Some old ladies led their grandchildren to the streets like celebrating a festival to welcome the Albanian distinguished guests. Zhao Xuexian, a fifty-year-old railway worker's family member, told reporters that she was very happy to hear that the Albanian comrades were coming to visit. Today, all three of her sons who are studying in school came to welcome them, and she also brought her sixty-year-old sister-in-law who had just come from the rural areas of Hebei to be a guest on the street. Zhao Xuexian said: "The Albanian people are so determined to oppose modern revisionism! The Albanian country is very strong, and the Albanian people are also very strong. What's the point of giving you something and you just follow it."
    The climax of the welcome followed one after another. Not far from the Xijiao State Guesthouse, more than 25,000 students from 22 universities in the capital shouted "Enver-Mao Zedong", "Mao Zedong-Enver". Zhan Dui and Cai Ren Duojie, Tibetan students from the mountainous areas of the Himalayas who were originally emancipated serfs and slaves, said that the fighting friendship between the people of China and Albania is higher than the Himalayas, and that the two peoples defend the purity of Marxism-Leninism, making it purer than the white snow on the Himalayas. The students of the Albanian language major of the Department of Eastern European Languages ​​at the Beijing Foreign Languages ​​Institute were particularly excited today. They kept cheering "Long live Enver Hoxha!" in Albanian. In the past few days, many students in this class have been busy selecting and translating various articles for some newspapers and magazines, introducing the four major revolutionary measures taken by the Albanian people in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and introducing the advanced figures and advanced deeds that have emerged from the Albanian people in the production struggle. Student Qian Guilan said that the Albanian people and youth are examples for us to learn from. We must be like them and be pioneers in the struggle against imperialism and revisionism. We must use the Albanian language to serve the promotion of the fighting friendship between the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania.
    In front of the entrance of the guesthouse, tens of thousands of excited smiling faces greeted close comrades-in-arms, and countless hands stretched out to the heroic warriors on the Adriatic coast. It is you who hold high the battle flag against imperialism and resolutely oppose the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism; it is you, dear comrades-in-arms, who have always unswervingly held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism, valiantly and unyieldingly, and persisted in the struggle against modern revisionism; it is you who have defended the purity of Marxism-Leninism with a high degree of principle and revolutionary firmness. People sent the distinguished guests into the guesthouse with lofty respect and deep feelings. The cheers of "Enver-Mao Zedong" and "Mao Zedong-Enver" echoed for a long time in the green trees of the guesthouse.

    向“山鹰之国”的英雄人民致敬
    今天，《北京—地拉那》的歌声响彻了北京城。首都上百万人走上街头，怀着强烈的深厚的无产阶级国际主义感情，向以穆罕默德·谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团致敬，向“山鹰之国”的英雄人民致敬。
    上百万人欢迎的盛况，这在北京是前所未有的。彩旗、鲜花、标语牌楼，把这个城市打扮得五彩缤纷。百万人的笑脸，震天的歌声，向站在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义斗争前列的阿尔巴尼亚兄弟和战友，倾注了最真挚的感情。这是六亿五千万人民的感情，是中阿两党两国和两国人民钢铁般团结的象征。
    有什么友情能够比得上经过惊涛骇浪的考验而凝结成的战斗的无产阶级友情呢？欢迎群众迸发出的欢呼声和口号声，震天动地。人们挥舞着彩绸，摇动着中阿两国国旗，高呼“中阿两国伟大人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“坚决反对全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义！”“坚决彻底反对现代修正主义！”这个百万人队伍所表示的意志，是一次战斗的检阅，是向帝国主义和现代修正主义的示威。
    欢迎的队伍一直延伸了二十五华里长。在从机场通往市区的公路两旁，在街头巷尾，在所有高大建筑物的窗口上，都集聚了欢迎的群众。成千成万人组成的文艺队伍，载歌载舞。无数的红旗、花环和彩带，陪衬着姑娘们节日的盛装，使这个城市更富有青春的活力。在雄伟的天安门广场上，将近四十个文艺团体，跳起了中国各民族的舞蹈，一千四百多人的大合唱队，发出了雄壮的歌声，十几万人组成的欢迎队伍，围集在广场四周，热情奔放，欢呼跳跃。谢胡同志由周恩来同志陪同，卡博同志由邓小平同志陪同，凯莱齐同志和纳赛同志由陈毅同志陪同，分别乘敞篷汽车，穿过彩色的人巷，绕过天安门广场，接受人们的欢迎。中阿两党两国领导同志，在敞篷车上频频招手向欢迎的群众致意，人们满怀激情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！”敞篷车穿过这条漫长的欢迎队伍，整整花了四十分钟，处处是人海，处处是高潮。
    在由机场通往市区的途中，中阿友好人民公社有七百多名社员，围集在公路边上敲锣打鼓，象接待亲人似地迎候贵宾。社员们兴奋地说：“日日盼，月月盼，可把亲人盼来了！”一些姑娘们连夜忙碌起来，一些老大爷和老大娘带着孩子赶来，当贵宾们乘坐的汽车经过他们面前时，社员们高呼：“中阿人民友好万岁！”曾经访问过阿尔巴尼亚的公社干部左秀琴，今天特地把一枚阿尔巴尼亚革命博物馆的纪念章戴在胸前。她兴奋地说：“一年前，霍查同志和谢胡同志亲切地问我们公社的生产情况，今天在我们家门口会见了谢胡同志，我们多么盼望谢胡同志能到我们公社来做客啊！”五好社员郭素清说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民为我们树立了革命的好榜样，每当我们生产上遇到困难的时候，我们就想起了阿尔巴尼亚人民不畏强暴的顽强精神，这种革命精神鼓舞着我们不断前进。”
    贵宾们乘敞篷车进入城外建设路南口的地方，和夹道欢迎的队伍迎面相遇。在这里汇集了近四万名工人、学生和街道居民。有一千多名穿着彩色服装的业余文艺工作者，在一座彩色牌楼下面一边舞蹈，一边高唱《社会主义好》。还有三百多名女学生在这里组成了一个花坛，姑娘们挥舞着鲜花，齐声欢呼：“欢迎！欢迎！”谢胡同志在车上挥着双手，向欢迎的群众致意。在这里的工人队伍中，有北京市学习毛主席著作先进集体——北京化工厂五车间三组的工人刘云生，他说他们的集体决心要学习阿尔巴尼亚人民不怕困难、不断革命的斗争精神，热烈欢迎谢胡同志来我国访问。刘云生说，“坚决反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的共同斗争，把中阿两国人民的心紧紧连在一起。阿尔巴尼亚人民在帝国主义和现代修正主义的包围下坚持革命斗争，这是对我们的最大支持和鼓舞。”
    贵宾们进入市区以后，出现了极其热烈的场面。从建国门到王府井，有数万名少年儿童和上万名业余文艺爱好者，组成一个巨大的舞蹈队和“彩带区”，一些工人和学生还用成百面大鼓和小鼓组成了一个“鼓群”，贵宾们走过时，鼓声震天，气势磅礴。
    在天安门广场，出现了一个盛况空前的壮观的场面。在这里，汇集了中国人民对阿尔巴尼亚兄弟最崇高的感情。今天，天安门城楼上宫灯高悬，扩音器里播送出中阿两国战斗的歌曲，整个广场宛如百花盛开，简直使得人们眼花缭乱。在这里，有一千四百多人组成的合唱队，在数百人的大乐队伴奏下，用中阿两国语言高唱《北京—地拉那》歌曲。在天安门城楼两旁的观礼台上，数千名学生用花朵组成中阿两国国旗的图案，在观礼台上，还排列着用中阿两国文字组成的“热烈欢迎谢胡同志”的巨大标语。在广场中心，有一个巨型花篮凌空高悬，有六千多名文艺工作者欢腾地跳起了十七个多姿多彩的民族舞蹈。正在北京演出的四川省凉山彝族自治州文工团，昨晚一夜没有睡好觉，今天一早赶来欢迎贵宾，他们以独特的民族风格的彝族舞来欢迎亲密的战友。他们说，我们一定要把今天亲眼见到欢迎阿尔巴尼亚同志的动人情景，转告彝族人民，我们彝族的心和全国人民一样，永远和阿尔巴尼亚人民联结在一起。
    今天的欢迎人群里，有中国人民解放军陆海空军和公安部队的队伍。他们穿着崭新的军服，精神焕发，高呼欢迎口号。在去年击沉美制蒋舰“剑门号”、“章江号”的海战中荣立一等功的黄汝省、余昭玉，今天也赶来欢迎贵宾。黄汝省是战斗英雄麦贤得的班长，他兴奋地说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民和军队经得起大风大浪，是过得硬的，今天，我是怀着向英雄人民，英雄军队学习的心情，赶来欢迎谢胡主席的。我们将永远和兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民站在一起，为反对美帝国主义、反对现代修正主义而斗争到底。”在人民解放军欢迎队伍的对面是首都民兵队伍，他们举着民兵师、民兵团的大旗，向贵宾们齐声欢呼。一些女民兵给记者朗诵了一首她们自己创作的诗：“阿尔巴尼亚的战友们来了！山欢呼，海喝采，全北京人民迎上街头来！牛鬼蛇神吓得发抖，远远地滚开！”
    今天，在千千万万欢迎的人群里，许多街道居民也都携老扶幼涌上街头，有些老大娘带领着孙子象过节一样奔向大街，去欢迎阿尔巴尼亚贵宾。五十岁的铁路工人家属赵雪仙对记者说，她听说阿尔巴尼亚的同志来访问，非常高兴。今天她的三个在学校读书的儿子全都来欢迎，她还把刚从河北农村来做客的六十多岁的老嫂子也一起带上街来。赵雪仙说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民反对现代修正主义可坚决啦！阿尔巴尼亚国家挺坚强的，阿尔巴尼亚人民也是挺坚强的。要是给你点东西你就跟它走，那算什么。”
    欢迎的高潮，一个接着一个。在西郊迎宾馆不远的地方，首都二十二所高等院校的两万五千多名学生，高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“毛泽东—恩维尔”。来自喜马拉雅山山区翻身农奴出身的藏族学生占堆和奴隶出身的才仁多杰说，中阿两国人民的战斗友谊比喜马拉雅山还高，两国人民捍卫马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，使它比喜马拉雅山上的皑皑白雪还要纯洁。北京外语学院东欧语系阿尔巴尼亚语专业的学生今天特别兴奋，他们不停地用阿尔巴尼亚语欢呼“恩维尔·霍查万岁！”这几天来，这个班的许多学生忙着为一些报刊杂志选译各种文章，介绍阿尔巴尼亚人民在反帝反修斗争中所采取的四大革命化措施，介绍阿尔巴尼亚人民在生产斗争中涌现出的先进人物和先进事迹。学生钱桂兰说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和青年是我们学习的榜样，我们要象他们一样当反帝反修斗争中的尖兵。我们要用阿尔巴尼亚语为促进中阿两党两国人民的战斗友谊服务。
    在迎宾馆门前，成千成万张激动的笑脸迎向亲密的战友，无数双手伸向亚得里亚海滨的英雄战士们。是你们，高举反对帝国主义的战斗旗帜，坚决反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策；是你们，亲爱的战友，始终不渝地高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，英勇顽强，同现代修正主义坚持斗争；是你们，以高度的原则性和革命坚定性捍卫了马克思列宁主义的纯洁性。人们怀着崇高的敬意和深厚的感情，把贵宾们送进了迎宾馆。“恩维尔—毛泽东”、“毛泽东—恩维尔”的欢呼声在迎宾馆的绿树丛中久久回荡着。
