    The most important point
    "Ideological construction is like a 'motor,' and organizational construction is like a 'chain.'" This vivid analogy of the relationship between ideological and organizational construction, put forward by the Party branch of the Dolomite Workshop of Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel Plant in practice, is realistic.
    When the motor starts, it generates power. What should be used to start the "motor" of Party ideological construction? The experience of the Dolomite Workshop branch is to use Mao Zedong Thought. Facts have proven that Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest driving force. The reason why our Party has become a glorious, great, and correct Party is that we are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Any Party branch, any Party member, who masters Mao Zedong Thought can exert tremendous power.
    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "Without a revolutionary party, without a revolutionary party built according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." All the work our Party leads the masses in is to carry the socialist revolution in our country through to the end and to support the revolutionary cause of the world's people. To successfully complete various work tasks, our Party's ranks must be neat, the soldiers must be elite, and the weapons must be good. This means that we must adhere to the principle of Mao Zedong Thought taking command and arm all Party members with Mao Zedong Thought. The process of our studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought creatively is also the process of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology. The Party branch of the Dolomite Workshop, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has become a "fire extinguisher" for individualism and an "insulator" for non-proletarian ideas, demonstrating strong combat effectiveness.
    When the "motor" starts, it can drive the "chain." If ideological construction is done well, the Party branch and mass organizations can fully play their organizational role. Organizational construction is equally important, just as without a chain, the motor cannot drive the machine. Only when people are organized can they form a strong collective and give full play to everyone's role. Of course, the soul of the organization is Mao Zedong Thought. Only when various organizations are armed with Mao Zedong Thought will they be closely united, unafraid of difficulties, and form a "chain" that cannot be broken or crushed. Otherwise, although organized in form, it may actually be scattered and unable to play its role well. The Party branch of the Dolomite Workshop seriously studied and applied Comrade Mao Zedong's works creatively, forming the central link of the entire "chain" and actively playing the role of the trade union and the Communist Youth League as a bond. The resolutions of the Party branch are implemented through them, and the demands of the masses are concentrated through them. In this way, the entire branch work becomes lively.
    The experience of the Dolomite Workshop Party branch tells us: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in ideological construction, and on this basis, do a good job in organizational construction. This is the most important point that all Party branches must grasp.

### 最主要之点

    最主要之点
    “思想建设好比‘马达’，组织建设好比‘链条’”。石钢白云石车间党支部，在实践中提出的这个思想建设和组织建设关系的形象化的比喻，是切合实际的。
    马达发动起来，就会产生力量。用什么来发动党的思想建设这个“马达”呢？白云石车间支部的经验是，用毛泽东思想。事实证明，毛泽东思想是最伟大的动力。我们党所以成为光荣的、伟大的、正确的党，就在于我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。哪个党支部，哪个党员，只要掌握了毛泽东思想，就能发挥巨大的力量。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”我们党领导群众进行的一切工作，都是为了把我国的社会主义革命进行到底和支援世界人民的革命事业。要很好地完成各项工作任务，我们党的队伍必须整齐，兵要精，武器要好。这就是说，必须坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，用毛泽东思想武装全体党员。我们活学活用毛泽东思想的过程，也就是兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想的过程。用毛泽东思想武装起来的白云石车间党支部，成为个人主义思想的“灭火机”，成为非无产阶级思想的“绝缘体”，表现了坚强的战斗力。
    “马达”发动起来，可以带动“链条”。思想建设搞好了，党的支部和群众组织就能充分发挥组织作用。组织建设同样是重要的，正如没有链条，马达就无法带动机器一样。人们只有组织起来，才能形成坚强的集体，才能充分发挥每个人的作用。当然，组织的灵魂是毛泽东思想。只有用毛泽东思想武装起来，各种组织才会紧密团结，不怕困难，形成打不断、碰不垮的“链条”。不然，虽然形式上组织起来，实际上可能是涣散的，不能很好地发挥作用。白云石车间党支部认真活学活用毛泽东同志著作，形成了整个“链条”的中心环节，积极发挥了工会、共青团组织的纽带作用。党支部的决议通过它们贯彻下去，群众的要求通过它们集中上来。这样一来，整个支部工作就做活了。
    白云石车间党支部的经验告诉我们：必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，搞好思想建设，并且在这个基础上搞好组织建设。这是所有党支部都要掌握的最主要之点。
