    The fox showed its tail
    To reward the Indonesian right-wing military group for their anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China achievements, the Johnson administration recently announced that it would sell 50,000 tons of rice to the right-wing military government through long-term credit loans. At the same time, Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik and U.S. Ambassador to Jakarta, Green, held "friendly talks" on U.S. "aid."
    Originally, U.S. imperialism was the backstage boss of the Indonesian right-wing military group. Everyone knows that the counter-revolutionary military coup in Indonesia was planned by U.S. imperialism in collusion with its accomplice, the Japanese reactionaries. However, when the Indonesian right-wing military group launched the coup last October, and even for several months thereafter, U.S. imperialism deliberately maintained "prudent silence," fearing that exposing the fox's tail would be detrimental to the right-wing forces in Indonesia. Now, when the right-wing military group has completed its plan to seize state power and has made a mess of the domestic economy, U.S. imperialism immediately慷慨解囊 (kāng kǎi jiě náng - generously offered financial assistance), extending its "helping" hand. In this way, it moved from backstage to the front stage, and its thick and large fox tail was finally exposed to public view.
    Originally, the Indonesian right-wing military group was the agent of U.S. imperialism. The thugs organized by the right-wing forces had already shouted the slogan "Long live the United States" in demonstrations. However, in order to deceive the domestic people and foreign public opinion, the right-wing military group "still held the pipa, half-covering her face" when selling themselves to U.S. imperialism. They even said that Indonesia still "opposes imperialism and opposes neo-colonialism and old colonialism." In fact, this kind of nonsense is worthless. Even the Japanese ambassador to Jakarta said that the focus of Indonesia's future diplomatic policy will be on "improving relations with the United States" and "being friendly to the United States." People have seen that the American "missionaries" arrested by the Indonesian government before last October have been released one by one; almost all the American reporters who had been expelled have returned to Indonesia; the rice "sold" by the United States, the wheat, barley, and milk powder "donated," and other "aid" are coming in an endless stream.
    Indonesian Foreign Minister Malik recently said that the emerging forces and the old forces are "not so absolute." Wonderful statement! Please see, while the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are talking about friendship with the United States, aren't they madly shouting that "China is imperialism" and "Zhina colonialism"? It should be told to the Indonesian reactionaries that you can sell yourselves to U.S. imperialism, either secretly or openly. However, it is more difficult than a camel passing through the eye of a needle to turn U.S. imperialism into an "emerging force" and people's China into an "old force," just like a magician!

    狐狸露出了尾巴
    为了犒赏反共、反人民、反华有功的印度尼西亚右派军人集团，约翰逊政府最近宣布，以长期信用贷款方式出售五万吨大米给右派军人政府。与此同时，印度尼西亚外交部长马利克同美国驻雅加达大使格林，就美“援”问题进行了“友好的会谈”。
    本来，美帝国主义就是印度尼西亚右派军人集团的后台老板。谁人不知，印度尼西亚的反革命军事政变，是美帝国主义伙同它的帮凶日本反动派策划的。可是，在印度尼西亚右派军人集团去年十月发动政变之初，乃至以后的好几个月时间，美帝国主义却故意保持“审慎的沉默”，生怕露出了狐狸的尾巴，对印度尼西亚右派势力反而不利。现在，当右派军人集团完成了夺取国家政权的计划，并把国内经济搞得一团糟的时候，美帝国主义马上慷慨解囊，伸过来“援助”之手。这样一来，它就从后台进入了前台，又粗又大的狐狸尾巴终于暴露在众目睽睽之下。
    本来，印度尼西亚右派军人集团就是美帝国主义的代理人。右派势力组织的暴徒，在示威游行中早就喊出了“美国万岁”的口号。可是，右派军人集团为了欺骗国内人民和国外舆论，在卖身投靠美帝国主义的时候，“犹抱琵琶半遮面”。他们甚至说什么印度尼西亚仍然“反对帝国主义和反对新老殖民主义”。其实，这种鬼话是一文不值的。就连日本驻雅加达的大使也说，印度尼西亚今后的外交政策重点将放在“改善同美国的关系上”，“要同美国友好”。人们看到，去年十月以前被印度尼西亚政府逮捕的美国“传教士”，已经一一释放；曾经一度被驱逐出境的美国记者，几乎全都返回了印度尼西亚；美国“出售”的大米，“捐给”的小麦、大麦和奶粉，以及其他“援助”，正源源而来。
    印度尼西亚外交部长马利克最近说，新兴力量和旧势力，“这并不是那么绝对的”。妙哉斯言！请看，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在同美国大讲友好的同时，不是狂叫“中国是帝国主义”、“支那殖民主义”吗？应当告诉印度尼西亚反动派，你们要卖身投靠美帝国主义，尽可偷偷摸摸地，或抛头露面地去干。但是，你们要象魔术师那样，把美帝国主义变成“新兴力量”，把人民中国变成“旧势力”，那是比骆驼穿过针眼还要困难得多！
