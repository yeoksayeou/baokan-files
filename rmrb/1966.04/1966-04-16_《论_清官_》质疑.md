    Questioning "On 'Upright Officials'"
    Kang Li
    Abstract: Comrade Xingyu's "On 'Upright Officials'" is one of the earlier and more influential articles to appear in the discussion of "upright officials." Comrade Wu Han praised it. Many comrades quoted it. Comrade Fang Qiu also claimed that he had made some good analyses of the "upright official" issue. However, the main arguments of this article, such as the existence of a struggle between "statutory rights" and "customary rights" in feudal society, and that "upright officials" became a kind of "self-regulator" of the feudal system by upholding "statutory rights," cannot help but raise a series of questions in our minds. Now we put them forward to Comrade Xingyu for advice, hoping to get a clear answer.
    I. The Origin of Doubts
    On May 29, 1964, the *People's Daily* published Comrade Xingyu's "On 'Upright Officials'," which criticized Comrade Wu Han's "theory of upright officials" without naming him.
    On June 17 of the same year, the *Guangming Daily* published Comrade Wu Han's "After Reading *A Tentative Discussion on 'Upright Officials,' 'Good Officials' in Feudal Society*," in which he praised "On 'Upright Officials'" as a "good article" whose basic arguments "are scientific and correct," "I agree with and am very happy about them," and believed that these "are exactly the basic arguments in my article *On Hai Rui*. These two articles elaborate on what I said, and I am of course very grateful."
    In a serious ideological debate, a critique was praised by the person being criticized as being fundamentally correct, even though he fundamentally denied that he had made any mistakes. Isn't the emergence of this rare phenomenon strange enough? Isn't it enough to make people think?
    On December 29, 1965, the *People's Daily* published Comrade Fang Qiu's "*What Kind of Social Trend Does *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* Represent?*" This is an article with a wide impact among the masses. The second part of this article criticized the reactionary role of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* in the current class struggle, pointing out that this play is a representative work of the anti-socialist trend of thought that uses the past to criticize the present, which is good. However, the first part of this article not only completely adopted the basic arguments of Comrade Xingyu's "On 'Upright Officials'" in many places, but also used a very conspicuous footnote to recommend this article to readers, affirming that it "made a serious criticism of Comrade Wu Han's anti-Marxist views on the issue of 'upright officials'," and praised it for "making some very good analyses of the 'upright official' issue." This further expanded the influence of Comrade Xingyu's article.
    Just two days before the publication of Comrade Fang Qiu's article, Comrade Wu Han reaffirmed in his article "*Self-Criticism on *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*," that his views on "upright officials" "have basically not changed much" to this day. That is to say, he still adheres to his same argument as Comrade Xingyu. There is also Mr. Ping Xin in Shanghai, who successively published two long articles evaluating "upright officials," repeating Comrade Xingyu's arguments in large quantities, and fiercely intimidated and rebuked comrades who criticized the "theory of upright officials": "May I ask if evidence is needed?" He even angrily declared that anyone who does not conform to this view is "essentially the same as revisionism."
    Putting the above-mentioned events together, the problem is so sharply placed before us: What kind of theory is Comrade Xingyu's theory of "upright officials"? Is it strung on the same vine as Comrade Wu Han's "theory of upright officials"? This cannot but further arouse our vigilance and suspicion. We repeatedly read "On 'Upright Officials'," and the more we read, the more questions we had. Now we put them forward, expecting Comrade Xingyu and other comrades to give clear answers.
    II. A Series of Questions
    Comrade Xingyu's "On 'Upright Officials'" opens with a general view of "upright officials":
    "The 'upright official' who is praised by opposing classes is neither purely derived from the deceptive fiction of the rulers, nor entirely the product of the illusory ideals of the masses, but a somewhat beautified actual political phenomenon." (Emphasis added by the author)
    This passage is the outline of the entire article, the starting point and destination of the entire article. All the arguments in "On 'Upright Officials'" revolve around this theme and serve to explain this theme.
    What are those arguments? To summarize:
    (1) Just as all things divide into two, feudal exploitation rights are also divided into statutory rights and extra-legal rights (or customary rights), which are interdependent and mutually opposed.
    (2) "Statutory rights" are the ruling rights fixed in legal form; "customary rights" are the ruling rights that go beyond the boundaries of feudal law to pursue unlimited exploitation. The former embodies the long-term and overall interests of the landlord class; the latter exposes the greedy nature of certain groups and individuals within the landlord class, and embodies the special and immediate interests of the landlord class.
    (3) The contradiction and struggle between "statutory rights" and "customary rights" runs through the entire feudal society. If the degree of exploitation exceeds the exploitation of "statutory rights," it will cause the rule of a certain group to collapse. Therefore, in order to maintain its long-term survival, "statutory rights" cannot but limit the scope of activity of "customary rights."
    (4) Maintaining the feudal "statutory rights" is one of the essential characteristics of "upright officials," and is the commonality of "upright officials." And the struggle of "upright officials" against powerful landlords is a manifestation of the conflict between feudal "statutory rights" and "customary rights." This struggle alleviates some of the disasters imposed on the people by powerful magnates, and also improves the lives of some peasants. As for the "upright officials" showing a certain degree of sympathy, pity, and concern for the masses, it may be completely sincere in their subjective minds.
    (5) "Upright officials" maintain "statutory rights," that is, the long-term interests of the landlord class, which is expressed differently in different periods: First, after large-scale peasant wars, "upright officials" are the capable assistants of "good emperors" in promoting the policy of "rehabilitation and recuperation" (i.e., "concession policy" - author's note); second, in the period when social contradictions are gradually intensifying, "upright officials" are a kind of "self-regulator" of the feudal system; third, after the outbreak of peasant wars, "upright officials" are the deceivers and executioners who disintegrate and slaughter the rebel army.
    Comrade Xingyu pointed out that it must not be thought that "'upright officials' should be completely negated," otherwise it would mean advocating that powerful magnates are better than "upright officials," "treating any atrocities as a source of progress," thinking that "the slave trader's whip can cause slaves to resist, so this whip should not be opposed." He believes that "this is an oversimplified view of complex historical processes." At the same time, he emphasized that it is necessary to "conduct specific analysis in conjunction with the situation of class struggle in each period" and make a "fair evaluation" of "upright officials."
    Comrade Xingyu's arguments cannot but lead to a series of questions.
    First, how should we view the so-called "feudal exploitation rights" or "feudal ruling rights"? How should we view feudal law?
    Comrade Xingyu believes that feudal exploitation rights can be "divided into two" into the opposition between "limited" statutory rights and "unlimited" customary rights; and feudal law reflects and maintains precisely this "limited" ruling right. This basic theoretical basis in Comrade Xingyu's "theory of upright officials" has in fact become the main theoretical support for many "upright official enthusiasts" at present. But:
    If we use this "divide into two" to understand the landlord class, then, due to the "mutual opposition" of "statutory rights" and "customary rights," shouldn't the landlord class be divided into the "statutory rights" faction and the "customary rights" faction or the "wise faction" and the "madman faction"?
    If we use this "divide into two" to examine the feudal laws formulated by the landlord class, and think that feudal laws only reflect and maintain ruling rights that do not exceed a certain "limit." Then, wouldn't the feudal "royal law" become a shackle and fetter specially used to bind certain members of the landlord class, rather than the tool of the landlord class to suppress the peasant class?
    If we use this "divide into two" to view the superstructure of feudal society, then, since "'statutory rights' cannot but limit the scope of activity of 'customary rights' in order to maintain their long-term survival," shouldn't the feudal superstructure also be divided into two different parts that are "mutually opposed" and "mutually struggling"?
    Can Comrade Xingyu's so-called "divide into two," the theory that feudal exploitation rights are divided into "statutory rights" and "customary rights" be regarded as revolutionary dialectics? Can it be regarded as revealing the objective laws of class struggle?
    As everyone knows, feudal law concentrates the greedy nature of the landlord class and is the tool of the landlord class to oppress the peasants. It guarantees the privileges of the entire landlord class, not just maintaining the interests of certain groups or individuals within it. At the same time, it only suppresses the "illegal acts" of peasants resisting oppression and exploitation; and never limits the exploitation and oppression of peasants by landlords. In feudal society, "I am the state." Not only can the emperor declare "the monarch wants his subjects to die, they must die"; even a small local bully can set up private courts and prisons to carry out so-called "legal" forced rent collection. Are these behaviors considered "statutory rights" or "customary rights"?
    Feudal law is actually just the will of the landlord class reflected by the feudal regime in the form of legislation. The landlord class can supplement new methods of oppressing peasants into the law at any time according to the needs of exploitation and oppression, and can also abolish certain articles that they believe are outdated or inconvenient at any time. In fact, with the continuous development of feudal society, feudal law has become more and more meticulous and cruel, putting heavier and heavier shackles on the peasants and bringing more and more benefits to the landlord class. Can this be said to be a "restriction" of "statutory rights" on the "illegal acts" of the landlord class?
    We believe that if we analyze feudal exploitation rights according to the Marxist view of "divide into two," the conclusion can only be: the objective law of class struggle always forces feudal exploitation rights to move towards their own opposite. The more the feudal ruling class strengthens the reactionary state apparatus (including the law), the more it arouses peasant resistance and the more it accelerates the collapse of its reactionary rule. This is the dialectics of history.
    Second, how should we view the so-called "long-term interests" and "immediate interests" of the landlord class?
    Comrade Xingyu believes that "statutory rights" embody the long-term and overall interests of the landlord class, while "customary rights" embody the special and immediate interests of the landlord class. The "restriction" of "statutory rights" on "customary rights" can alleviate the oppression suffered by the people.
    And Comrade Wu Han once said: Hai Rui, Kuang Zhong, and other "upright officials" are worth "learning" because they "consciously did some good things," and "these good things are consistent with the long-term interests of the feudal ruling class and the current interests of the vast number of oppressed and exploited people."
    Comparing these two statements, what is the theoretical difference between them?
    According to this view, the so-called "long-term interests" of the landlord class of course refer to this class maintaining its reactionary rule from generation to generation. However, this can only be the wishful thinking of all reactionary classes, and it is fundamentally impossible to realize in real life. Since this is the case, how can we say that feudal law reflects and realizes this illusory "long-term interest" that cannot be realized at all?
    Does it mean that as long as the landlord class's oppression does not exceed the "limits" permitted by the feudal "royal law," the peasants will willingly be slaughtered without rebelling?
    Does it mean that as long as the landlord class's exploitation does not exceed the "scope" stipulated by the feudal "royal law," the reactionary rule of the landlord class can continue from generation to generation?
    Does it mean that the "three-foot royal law" in the hands of "upright officials" is not the whip prepared by the landlord class for the peasants? How can the "interests" of the master who holds the whip and the slave who is whipped be "consistent"? Can there be "consistent interests" between those who eat people and those who are eaten?
    Finally, can it be said that being a slave, a beast of burden, and being satisfied with a stable position of being insulted and harmed is the "current interest" of the peasants?
    In class society, there is no common class interest between opposing classes. The interests of the landlord class, from a long-term perspective, are exploitation, and from an immediate perspective, they are still exploitation. The interests of the peasant class, whether from a long-term perspective or from a current perspective, can only be the struggle to resist the oppression and exploitation of the landlord class. Every increase in the interests of the landlord class doubles the suffering of the peasant class. Isn't this an objective truth that has been confirmed by countless historical facts?
    Third, how should we view the "incorruptibility" and "greed" of feudal officials? How should we view the struggle of "upright officials" against powerful magnates? How should we view the "love of the people like children" of "upright officials"? Are "upright officials" completely sincere in their subjective minds?
    If it is said that in order to oppose "wholesale negation" of "upright officials," it is necessary to oppose "upright officials" to local tyrants, and even to think that the struggle of "upright officials" against powerful magnates is because he "revealed sympathy for the suffering of the people." Then, inferring from this, wouldn't the "honesty and devotion to public service" of "upright officials" be devoted to the "public" of both the exploiting class and the exploited class? Wouldn't the "incorruptibility and selflessness" of "upright officials" be "selfless" to both the landlord class and the peasant class? Isn't the yamen and court where "upright officials" are located a national state and a national court that is above the landlord class and the peasant class?
    If it is said that the struggle of "upright officials" against local bullies is to alleviate the exploitation and oppression suffered by the people; then, what is the class essence of "upright officials"? Are "upright officials" and local bullies growing on the same root of the landlord class? Are "upright officials" the tool of the landlord class's dictatorship? If we admit that "upright officials" are the tools of the landlord class, then how can "upright officials" play a "role in exposing the feudal system"? Would they consciously and voluntarily lift a stone to smash their own feet?
    If it is said that the anti-corruption of "upright officials" is beneficial to the people; then, is the anti-corruption of "upright officials" for the sake of the feudal state, or for the sake of the peasant class? Facts have proved that the more "upright officials" fight corruption, the more money and grain the feudal state receives, and the more fierce the exploitation and plunder of the working peasants. Where is there even a shred of "benefit" for the peasants?
    If "corrupt officials" are like a ferocious beast that reveals its hideous nature, determined to devour everything it can see; then, aren't "upright officials" even more like a beautiful snake? Especially from the point of view that "upright officials" are the political idols of the landlord class, doesn't it play a reactionary role of deceiving and anesthetizing the people that "corrupt officials" cannot play? Isn't the bankruptcy of "upright officials" a reflection of the fact that the feudal rulers have run out of tricks in playing the counter-revolutionary deception and have to resort to violent suppression?
    If it is said that "upright officials" flaunt "love for the people," and "may be completely sincere in their subjective minds." Then, is it possible for there to be any "love beyond class" in the world? Since Comrade Xingyu admits that the "love for the people" of "upright officials" is nothing more than a reflection of the landlord class's need for labor and the disguise of cruel exploitation, why do we say that the "love for the people" of "upright officials" "may be completely sincere in their subjective minds"? Isn't this self-contradictory?
    We believe that in order to correctly explain these problems, we must follow Comrade Liu Shaoqi's article "*The Class Nature of Man*," "All exploiting classes must deceive and oppress the exploited, and must compete with each other for the surplus products or surplus value of the exploited; therefore, it creates the deceptiveness, oppression of people, and mutual competition of all exploiters." The suppression of local bullies and anti-corruption of "upright officials" are nothing more than a farce of the landlord class competing with each other for the fruits of exploitation, and "upright officials" are just a "second clown" (i.e., a small painted face) wearing a mask in this farce. If it is thought that such an understanding is an "oversimplified view of complex historical processes"; then, does it even mean that it is necessary to record a great achievement for these deceivers in the revolutionary merit book of the people?
    Fourth, are "upright officials" a "self-regulator" of the feudal system?
    In "On 'Upright Officials'," Comrade Xingyu created a "novel" statement: "The 'upright officials' of the Bao Zheng and Hai Rui types are actually a kind of self-regulator of the feudal system in the process of intensifying contradictions." And said: "The reason why 'upright officials' in the ruling class are constantly praised among the people lies in this."
    What kind of thing this "self-regulator" is, I am afraid no one has ever seen it. I heard that there is a kind of sluice gate that can automatically control the opening and closing according to the rise and fall of the water level and the size of the water pressure. This is probably a kind of "self-regulator." Isn't it? The "illegal acts of powerful magnates" are rampant, exceeding the "limits" of "statutory rights," causing the people to "resist and grow secretly"; so a few "upright officials" ran out to "reform malpractices, redress unjust verdicts, reduce taxes, provide disaster relief, and restrain the illegal acts of powerful magnates" in "local areas and local scopes," in order to "inhibit the torrents of customary rights that break through the dike."
    Is this really the case in historical facts? Can the landlord class, as one of the reactionary exploiting classes, grasp the objective laws of class struggle? Will the development of class struggle listen to the command and deployment of the reactionary class? Can the landlord class automatically regulate and control the various contradictions of feudal society? If it is said that "upright officials" are a "self-regulator," then what kind of contradictions can they regulate? Is it to regulate the contradiction between the landlord class and the peasant class? In feudal society, the landlord class is constantly carrying out cruel political oppression and economic exploitation of the peasants, and at the same time, it will inevitably arouse the peasant class to carry out various forms of resistance at all times. How can "upright officials" regulate this fundamentally irreconcilable class contradiction? Is it to regulate the internal contradictions of the landlord class? The nature of the landlord class, which is deceitful and self-seeking, determines that the struggle between the various groups within the landlord class for the fruits of exploitation will never stop for a moment. Moreover, as a member of the landlord class, "upright officials" have always been a vicious dog in this dog-eat-dog struggle. In this case, what social contradictions can "upright officials" regulate, and what kind of "self-regulator" can they be?
    Fifth, how should we correctly treat Marxist classic works?
    Comrade Xingyu's statement of dividing feudal exploitation rights into "statutory rights" and "customary rights" is said to be quoted from Marx's article "Debates on the Law on Theft of Wood" written in 1842. But as far as we know, Marx's paper published in the *Rheinische Zeitung* was originally used to oppose the servile attitude of the Rhineland Provincial Assembly towards the Junker aristocracy. In order to use the enemy's spear to attack the enemy's shield, Marx used the existing bourgeois legal language in the article, which also included the terms "statutory rights" and "customary rights." At that time, although Marx was only a revolutionary democrat, he had already mercilessly pointed out that "statutory rights" and "customary rights" are consistent rather than opposed, thus exposing the hypocrisy of bourgeois legal rights. And when Marx became the revolutionary teacher of the proletariat, in classic works such as *The Class Struggles in France, 1848 to 1850* and *The Civil War in France*, he fully expounded the theory of the state apparatus, clearly pointing out that the state is a tool of class oppression. Why did Comrade Xingyu put aside the fundamental views of Marx's theory of the state, and not pay attention to it, but have such a high interest in Marx's early works? Why did Marx clearly emphasize the consistency of "statutory rights" and "customary rights," but Comrade Xingyu insisted on emphasizing the restriction of "statutory rights" on "customary rights"?
    In short, Comrade Xingyu not only affirmed that "upright officials" are a "practical political phenomenon," but also affirmed that "upright officials" are "praised by opposing classes." Isn't this equivalent to saying that "upright officials" are the common political representatives of opposing classes existing in history and real life? Do the actions of "upright officials" actually reflect the common interests of opposing classes? How can this kind of argument draw a line between it and Comrade Wu Han's theory of class conciliation? Can it be regarded as a "divide into two"? Is it dialectics or eclecticism?
    III. Feelings After Questioning
    The problem of "upright officials," in the final analysis, is a problem of how to understand the essence of the reactionary state apparatus.
    Chairman Mao pointed out: "The state machine, such as the army, police, and courts, is a tool for class oppression of classes. For hostile classes, it is a tool of oppression, it is violence, it is not something 'benevolent'." (*On People's Democratic Dictatorship*)
    Chairman Mao also pointed out: "Warlords, bureaucrats, local tyrants, and evil gentry are the political representatives of the landlord class, and they are the particularly vicious among the landlords." (*How to Analyze Rural Classes*)
    This is the most profound exposure of the essence of the state apparatus and all feudal officials, including "upright officials" and "corrupt officials." How to understand the essence of the state apparatus has always been the center of the debate between Marxists and all opportunists. Take a look at the petty-bourgeois socialist Proudhon. He understood the unity of opposites as the mechanical combination of "bad" and "good" aspects, and thus advocated that the "bad" aspects of capitalism must be eliminated and the so-called "good" capitalism must be established. Marx once sharply criticized this eclecticism and class conciliationism, saying: "He is completely like a political utopian, wanting to regard the king, the House of Commons, and the House of Lords as constituent parts of social life, as eternal categories." (*Selected Works of Marx and Engels Letters*, People's Publishing House, page 26) Please also review a familiar "famous saying" of Kautsky. He said: "There are no two classes in a society that have no common interests. Even between slave owners and slaves there are common interests. If the master is poor, the slave will also starve, and if the slave is sick, the master will suffer losses. This temporary convergence of interests does not exclude their long-term class opposition." (*The Economic Impact of National Debt*, 1915) In the writings of today's Neo-Kautskyists, such bizarre arguments appear in large numbers. For example, in 1959, a book exploring the crisis of bourgeois legal system in modern imperialist countries was published abroad, which talked about "the rule of law strengthens the bourgeoisie on the one hand, and restricts the rule of the bourgeoisie on the other hand"; declaring that "the view that any legal norm of the bourgeois state plays a reactionary role in the era of imperialism is too simplistic"; and believing that many "norms in bourgeois law fix the political concessions that the masses forced the ruling class to make in a long and tenacious struggle," and so on.
    This opportunist trend of thought that has appeared in the international communist movement is a good historical mirror. It tells us that if we do not adhere to the spirit of thorough revolutionary criticism and do not use the viewpoint of class struggle to understand social and historical phenomena, we will inevitably slip into the quagmire of eclecticism and class conciliationism. Therefore, although Comrade Xingyu started from the desire to criticize Comrade Wu Han's "theory of upright officials," if he cannot thoroughly stand on the revolutionary position and draw a line between all opportunist views, he will go to the opposite of his wishes. It is particularly worth pointing out that Mr. Ping Xin, who praised "upright officials" as "honeysuckle plants," actually regarded Comrade Xingyu's argument about "upright officials" as a shield to cover himself, thinking that he could safely throw out the dirtiest words and carry out vicious insults behind this shield. Doesn't the emergence of this phenomenon deserve the vigilance and deep thinking of Comrade Xingyu and every comrade who is willing to fight to defend the purity of Marxism?

    《论“清官”》质疑
    康立
    内容提要：星宇同志的《论“清官”》，是“清官”讨论中出现较早、影响较大的一篇文章。吴晗同志称赞它。很多同志引用它。方求同志也称他对“清官”问题作了一些很好的分析。但是，这篇文章的主要论点，如封建社会中存在“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的斗争，“清官”由于维护“法定权利”而成为封建制度的一种“自我调节器”等，却不禁引起了我们一连串的疑问。现在提出来向星宇同志请教，希望能得到明确解答。
    一、疑问的由来
    一九六四年五月二十九日，《人民日报》发表了星宇同志的《论“清官”》，不指名地批评了吴晗同志的“清官论”。
    同年六月十七日，《光明日报》发表了吴晗同志的《〈试论封建社会的“清官”、“好官”〉读后》，其中称赞了《论
  “清官”》是一篇“好文章”，基本论点“是科学的，正确的”，
  “我都很赞成，并且很高兴”，并认为这些“也正好是我的《论海瑞》一文中的基本论点，我说过的话，这两篇文章加以发挥，我当然很感激”。
    在一场严肃的思想论战中，一篇批评文章，在被批评者根本不承认自己有丝毫错误的情况下，却博得了他对文章基本观点的满口赞颂。这种罕见现象的出现，难道还不够令人奇怪么？难道还不够发人深思么？
    一九六五年十二月二十九日，《人民日报》发表了方求同志的《〈海瑞罢官〉代表一种什么社会思潮？》。这是一篇在群众中有着广泛影响的文章。这篇文章的第二部分，批评了《海瑞罢官》在现实阶级斗争中的反动作用，指出了这出戏是借古非今的反社会主义思潮的一个代表作，这是好的。但这篇文章的第一部分，不仅在许多地方完全采用了星宇同志《论“清官”》一文的基本论点；而且还用了一个十分显眼的夹注，向读者推荐这篇文章，肯定它“对吴晗同志在‘清官’问题上的反马克思主义观点提出了认真的批评”，赞扬它“对‘清官’问题作了一些很好的分析”。从而进一步扩大了星宇同志这篇文章的影响。
    就在方求同志文章发表前两天，吴晗同志还在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》一文里重申：他对“清官”的看法，至今“基本上还没有什么改变”。这就是说，他仍然坚持他的跟星宇同志相同的论点。上海还有位平心先生，更连续地发表了两篇评价“清官”的长文，大量地重复了星宇同志的论点，气势汹汹地对批判“清官”论的同志进行了恫吓性的诘责：“请问要不要列举证据？”甚至怒气冲冲地宣称，凡是不符合这种观点的，便是“同修正主义实质上是一路货色”。
    把上面说的这几件事联系起来，问题就这么尖锐地摆在我们面前：星宇同志的“清官”理论，究竟是一种什么理论？是不是跟吴晗同志的“清官论”串到一根藤上去了？这就不能不更加引起我们的警惕与怀疑。我们反复地阅读了《论“清官”》，越读觉得问题越多，现在把它们提出来，期待星宇同志和其他同志能作明确的解答。
    二、一连串的问题
    星宇同志的《论“清官”》，劈头就提出了一段对“清官”的总看法：
    “被对立的阶级所共同称赞的‘清官’，既不纯粹出自统治者欺骗性的虚构，也不完全是人民群众虚幻理想的产物，而是多少被美化了的实际政治现象。”（重点引者所加）
    这一段话，是全文的纲，是全文的出发点和归宿。《论“清官”》里的所有论点，都围绕这个主题而展开，为说明这个主题服务。
    那是些什么论点呢？概括地说：
    （一）象所有事物都一分为二那样，封建剥削权利也分裂为法定的权利和法外的权利（或习惯权利），两者互相依存而又互相对立。
    （二）“法定权利”是用法律形式固定下来的统治权利；“习惯权利”是超越封建法律界限去追求无限制剥削的统治权利。前者体现了地主阶级长远的、整体的利益；后者则暴露出地主阶级内部某些集团、个人的贪婪本性，体现了地主阶级特殊的、眼前的利益。
    （三）“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的矛盾和斗争，始终贯穿在整个封建社会中。如果剥削程度超越了“法定权利”的剥削，就会使得一定集团的统治趋于崩溃。因此，“法定权利”为要维持本身的长期生存，就不能不限制“习惯权利”的活动范围。
    （四）维护封建的“法定权利”，就是“清官”的本质特点之一，就是“清官”的共性。而“清官”反对豪强地主的斗争，就是封建的“法定权利”和“习惯权利”相冲突的一种表现形式。这种斗争，解除了豪强权贵加在人民头上的一些灾难，也会使一部分农民的生活得到改善。至于“清官”对人民群众表现一定的同情、怜悯和关心，主观上也可能完全是真诚的。
    （五）“清官”维护“法定权利”即地主阶级长远利益，不同时期有不同表现：一、当大规模的农民战争过去之后，“清官”是“好皇帝”推行“安养生息”政策（即“让步政策”——笔者）的得力助手；二、在社会矛盾逐步尖锐化时期，“清官”是封建制度的一种“自我调节器”；三、在农民战争起来后，“清官”是瓦解、屠杀起义军的骗子手和屠夫。
    星宇同志指出，决不能认为“‘清官’的所作所为应该完全否定”，否则就是主张豪强权贵比“清官”好，“把任何暴行都当作了进步的源泉”，以为“贩奴者的鞭笞可以引起奴隶反抗，因此就不应该反对这种鞭笞”。他认为“这是对复杂历史过程过分简单化的看法”。同时，强调必须“结合各个时期阶级斗争的形势进行具体分析”，给“清官”作出“恰如其分的评价”。
    星宇同志的这些论点不能不引出一连串的问题。
    第一，究竟怎样看待所谓“封建剥削权利”或“封建的统治权利”？究竟怎样看待封建法律？
    星宇同志认为，封建剥削权利可以“一分为二”成“有限制”的法定权利和“无限制”的习惯权利的对立；而封建法律所反映和所维护的就正是这种“有限制”的统治权利。星宇同志“清官论”中的这个基本理论根据，目前事实上已成了许多“清官迷”的主要理论靠山。但是：
    如果按照这种“一分为二”去认识地主阶级，那么，由于“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的“互相对立”，地主阶级内部岂不是就该分成“法定权利”派和“习惯权利”派或“明智派”和“狂人派”了么？
    如果按照这种“一分为二”去考察地主阶级制定的封建法律，认为封建法律只反映和维护不超越一定“界限”的统治权利。那么，封建“王法”岂不是变成了专门用来束缚某些地主阶级分子的枷锁和镣铐，而不是地主阶级用来镇压农民阶级的专政工具了么？
    如果按照这种“一分为二”去看待封建社会的上层建筑，那末，由于“‘法定权利’为要维持本身的长期生存，就不能不限制‘习惯权利’的活动范围”，岂不是封建的上层建筑也得分裂成“互相对立”、“互相斗争”的两个不同部分了么？
    星宇同志的这种所谓“一分为二”，所谓封建剥削权利分裂为“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的理论，能不能算是革命的辩证法呢？能不能算是揭示了阶级斗争的客观规律呢？
    大家知道，封建法律集中地反映了地主阶级的贪婪本性，是地主阶级压迫农民的专政工具。它保障的是整个地主阶级的特权，而不是只维护其中某些集团或个人的利益。同时，它镇压的也只是农民反抗压迫和剥削的“不法行为”；而决不限制地主对农民的剥削和压迫。在封建社会中，“朕即国家”。不仅皇帝可以宣称“君要臣死，不得不死”；就连一个小小的土豪劣绅崽子，也可以私设公堂和监牢，进行所谓“合法”的逼租索债。这些行为究竟算是“法定权利”呢还是“习惯权利”？
    封建法律，其实不过是由封建政权用立法形式反映的地主阶级意志而已。地主阶级根据剥削和压迫的需要，可以随时把压迫农民的新办法补充进法律中去，也可以随时废除他们认为已经过时或不便的某些条文。实际上，随着封建社会的不断发展，封建法律也越来越周密、越残酷，给农民套上越来越重的枷锁，给地主阶级带来越来越多的利益。这能说成是“法定权利”对地主阶级“不法行为”的“限制”吗？
    我们认为，要按照马克思主义的“一分为二”的观点去分析封建剥削权利的话，所得出的结论只能是：阶级斗争的客观规律总是逼使封建剥削权利走向自己的反面。封建统治阶级越是加强反动的国家机器（包括法律在内），就越是引起农民的反抗，越是加速它的反动统治的崩溃。这就是历史的辩证法。
    第二，究竟怎样看待地主阶级的所谓“长远利益”和“眼前利益”？
    星宇同志认为，“法定权利”体现了地主阶级长远的、整体的利益，“习惯权利”则体现了地主阶级特殊的、眼前的利益。“法定权利”对“习惯权利”的“限制”，可以减轻人民受到的压迫。
    而吴晗同志就曾说过：海瑞、况钟等“清官”所以值得“学习”，就因为他们“有意识地办了一些好事”，“这些好事是和封建统治阶级的长远利益一致的，也是和被压迫被剥削的广大人民当前利益一致的”。
    比较这两种说法，在理论上究竟又有什么不同呢？
    按照这种观点，所谓地主阶级的“长远利益”，当然是指这个阶级要维持它的反动统治，从一世传到万世。但是，这只能是一切反动阶级的痴心妄想，在现实生活中是根本不可能实现的。既然这样，又怎么能说封建法律反映并实现了这种根本不能实现的虚幻的“长远利益”呢？
    难道说，只要地主阶级的压迫不超过封建“王法”许可的“界限”，农民就会心甘情愿地受宰割而不起来造反么？
    难道说，只要地主阶级的剥削不逾越封建“王法”规定的“范围”，地主阶级的反动统治便可能从一世延续到万世么？
    难道说，“清官”手里的“三尺王法”，不是地主阶级替农民准备的鞭子吗？手执鞭子的主子和挨鞭子的奴隶之间，他们的“利益”又怎样“一致”起来呢？难道吃人的和被人吃的可以存在“利益一致”么？
    最后，难道可以说，做奴隶，当牛马，满足于稳稳当当的被侮辱被损害的地位，就是农民的“当前利益”吗？
    在阶级社会里，对立的阶级之间，根本不存在什么共同的阶级利益。地主阶级的利益，从长远来看是剥削，从眼前来看还是剥削。农民阶级的利益，不论从长远看还是从当前看，都只能是反抗地主阶级压迫剥削的斗争。地主阶级利益每增长一分，农民阶级的苦难就加重一倍。这难道不是已被无数历史事实证实了的客观真理么？
    第三，究竟怎样看待封建官吏的“清”与“贪”？怎样看待“清官”反对 豪强权贵的斗争？怎样看待“清官”的“爱民如子”？“清官”在主观上是不是完全真诚？
    如果说，为了反对“一概否定”“清官”而一定要把“清官”与地主豪强对立起来，甚至认为“清官”反对豪强权贵的斗争是由于他“对人民群众的苦难流露过同情”。那么，由此推论下去，岂非“清官”的“廉洁奉公”，既奉剥削阶级的“公”，又奉被剥削阶级的“公”了吗？“清官”的“清正无私”，岂非既对地主阶级“无私”，又对农民阶级“无私”吗？“清官”所在的衙门、公堂岂非是凌驾于地主阶级和农民阶级之上的全民国家、全民法庭么？
    如果说，“清官”的反豪强斗争是为了减轻人民所受的剥削和压迫；那么，“清官”的阶级本质又是什么呢？“清官”与豪强是不是生长在同一个地主阶级根子上的？“清官”是不是地主阶级的专政工具？如果承认“清官”是地主阶级的工具，那么“清官”又怎能起“揭露封建制度的作用”呢？难道他们会自觉自愿地搬起石头来砸自己的脚吗？
    如果说，“清官”反贪污对人民有利；那么，“清官”反贪污，难道不是替封建国家打算，而是替农民阶级打算？事实证明，“清官”越反贪污，封建国家的钱粮收入也就越多，对劳动农民的剥削搜刮也就越凶。这对农民，又哪里有一丝一毫的“好处”呢？
    如果说，“贪官”象一头显露出狰狞本相的恶兽，一心要吞噬掉所能看得见的一切；那么，“清官”难道就不更象一条美女蛇吗？特别是从“清官”是地主阶级的政治偶象这一点来看，它不正是起了“贪官”所不能起的欺骗麻醉人民的反动作用么？“清官”的破产，不正是反映了封建统治者在玩弄反革命的欺骗一手上已经黔驴技穷，而不得不乞灵于暴力镇压么？
    如果说，“清官”标榜“爱民”，“主观上可能完全是真诚的”。那么，世界上难道可能存在着什么“超阶级的爱”么？星宇同志既然承认“清官”的“爱民”无非是反映了地主阶级对劳动人手的需要和对残酷剥削的伪装，为何又说什么“清官”的“爱民”在“主观上可能完全是真诚的”，岂非自相矛盾了吗？
    我们认为，要正确地解释这些问题，就必须按照刘少奇同志在《人的阶级性》一文中所指出的，“一切剥削阶级，都要欺骗与压迫被剥削者，都要互相争夺被剥削者的剩余生产物或剩余价值；因此，就造成一切剥削者的欺骗性、对于人的压迫性及互相争夺性。”“清官”的压抑豪强及反贪污等，不过是地主阶级内部互相争夺剥削果实的一场闹剧，而“清官”则不过是这场闹剧中戴着假面具的一个“二丑”（即小花脸）罢了。假如认为，这样的理解便是“对复杂历史过程过分简单化的看法”；那么，是不是竟认为需要在人民的革命功劳簿上替这些骗子手记上一大功呢？
    第四，“清官”是封建制度的“一种自我调节器”吗？
    在《论“清官”》中星宇同志曾创造了一种“新奇”的提法：“包拯、海瑞之流的‘清官’实际上是封建制度在矛盾尖锐化过程中的一种自我调节器。”并且说：“统治阶级中的‘清官’在人民中传颂不绝的根据就在于此。”
    这个“自我调节器”究竟是种什么东西，恐怕谁也没见过。听说有种水闸，能够根据水位的涨落和流水压力的大小自动控制启闭，这大概就是一种“自我调节器”。不是吗？“豪强权贵的不法行为”泛滥了，超过了“法定权利”的“限度”，引起了人民“反抗激流潜滋暗长”；于是就跑出了几个“清官”，“在局部地区和局部范围内，改革弊政，平反冤狱，减轻赋税，赈济灾荒，约束豪强权贵的不法行为”，以“抑制决堤而出的习惯权利的逆流狂澜”。
    历史事实真是这样吗？作为反动剥削阶级之一的地主阶级，能够掌握阶级斗争的客观规律吗？阶级斗争的发展会听从反动阶级的指挥和调动吗？地主阶级能自动地调节和控制封建社会的各项矛盾吗？如果说，“清官”是一种“自我调节器”，那究竟能调节什么矛盾呢？是调节地主阶级同农民阶级的矛盾吗？在封建社会中，地主阶级无时无刻不在对农民进行残酷的政治压迫和经济剥削，同时也就必然激起农民阶级每时每刻都在进行各种形式的反抗。“清官”又怎样来调节这种根本不可调和的阶级矛盾呢？是调节地主阶级内部矛盾吗？地主阶级尔虞我诈、损人利己的本性决定了地主阶级内部各集团之间争夺剥削果实的斗争，永远不会有片刻的停止。而且，作为地主阶级的一员，“清官”从来就是这种狗咬狗斗争中的一头恶狗。在这种情况下，“清官”究竟能调节什么社会矛盾，究竟算哪一门的“自我调节器”呢？
    第五、究竟怎样正确对待马克思主义的经典著作？
    星宇同志把封建剥削权利分为“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的提法，据说系引自马克思在一八四二年写的《关于林木盗窃法的辩论》一文。但据我们所知，马克思的这篇发表在《莱茵报》上的论文，原是用来反对德国莱茵省议会对容克贵族的奴颜婢膝态度的。为了以子之矛、攻子之盾，马克思曾在文中运用了现成的资产阶级法学语言，其中也包括“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的名词在内。当时，马克思尽管还只是一个革命民主主义者，但已经毫不留情地指出了“法定权利”与“习惯权利”是一致的而不是对立的，从而揭穿了资产阶级法权的虚伪性。而当马克思在成为无产阶级的革命导师之后，在《一八四八年至一八五○年的法兰西阶级斗争》、《法兰西内战》等经典著作中，便曾完整地阐述了国家机器学说，明确地指出了国家是阶级压迫的工具。为什么星宇同志对马克思国家学说的根本观点搁置一旁，不加理会，却对马克思早期著作有着那么高的兴趣呢？为什么马克思明明强调的是“法定权利”和“习惯权利”的一致，而星宇同志却偏要去强调什么“法定权利”对“习惯权利”的限制呢？
    总之，星宇同志不仅肯定“清官”是一种“实际政治现象”，并且还肯定“清官”是“被对立的阶级所共同称赞的”。这岂不是等于说，“清官”是历史和实际生活中存在的对立阶级共同的政治代表吗？“清官”的所作所为，实际上是反映了对立阶级的共同利益吗？这种论调，又怎样和吴晗同志的阶级调和论划清界限呢？能不能算是一种“一分为二”呢？究竟是辩证法呢还是折中主义？
    三、质疑后有感
    “清官”问题，说到底，是一个怎样认识反动国家机器本质的问题。
    毛主席指出：“军队、警察、法庭等项国家机器，是阶级压迫阶级的工具。对于敌对的阶级，它是压迫的工具，它是暴力，并不是什么‘仁慈’的东西。”（《论人民民主专政》）
    毛主席又指出：“军阀、官僚、土豪、劣绅是地主阶级的政治代表，是地主中特别凶恶者。”（《怎样分析农村阶级》）
    这是对国家机器、对包括“清官”、“贪官”在内的一切封建官吏本质的最深刻的揭露。如何认识国家机器的本质，从来就是马克思主义者和一切机会主义者争论的中心。请看一看小资产阶级社会主义者蒲鲁东。他把对立面的统一理解为“坏的”和“好的”两方面的机械结合，从而据以主张必须消除资本主义“坏的”方面，建立所谓“好的”资本主义。马克思曾经尖锐地批评了这种折中主义和阶级调和论的主张说：“他完全象一个政治上的空论家，想把国王、众议院、贵族院一并当做社会生活的构成部分，当做永恒的范畴。”（《马克思恩格斯书信选集》，人民出版社版，第二六页）请再重新温习一下大家熟悉的考茨基的一段“名言”。他说：“一个社会里没有两个毫无共同利益的阶级。甚至奴隶主和奴隶之间也有共同利益。主人穷了，奴隶也就要挨饿，奴隶病了，主人就要受损失。这种一时的利害一致并不排斥他们之间的长期的阶级对立。”（《国债的经济影响》，一九一五年）在今天的新考茨基主义者的著作中，更是大量地出现了这种奇谈怪论。例如，一九五九年，在国外曾出版了一本探讨现代帝国主义国家中资产阶级法制危机的书，其中就曾经大谈什么“法制的统治一方面加强了资产阶级，它方面又限制了资产阶级的统治”；宣称“认为在帝国主义时代，资产阶级国家的任何法律规范都起着反动的作用，这样一种观点太简单化了”；并认为资产阶级法律中的许多“规范把人民群众在长期顽强斗争中逼使统治阶级作出的政治让步固定下来”了，等等。
    国际共产主义运动中曾经出现过的这种机会主义思潮，是一面很好的历史镜子。它告诉了我们，如果不是坚持彻底的革命批判精神，不用阶级斗争的观点来认识社会历史现象，就必然会滑到折中主义和阶级调和论的泥潭里去。因此，尽管星宇同志从批评吴晗同志的“清官论”的愿望出发，但若是不能彻底地站在革命的立场上和一切机会主义观点划清界线的话，就会走到自己愿望的相反方面去。特别值得指出的是，极口称颂“清官”是“忍冬科植物”的平心先生，竟如获至宝地把星宇同志关于“清官”的论点当成了一面掩护自己的盾牌，自以为躲在这块盾牌后面，可以万无一失地向人们抛出最肮脏的字句，进行刻毒的谩骂。这种现象的出现，难道还不值得星宇同志和我们每一个愿为捍卫马克思主义纯洁性而斗争的同志警惕和深思么？
