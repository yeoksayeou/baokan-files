    An Unusual Spring
    The spring of 1966 is an unusual one in the hearts of the Albanian people. The Albanian Labor Party's call for self-reliance, vigorous development of agricultural production, and striving for national self-sufficiency in grain resonated like a spring thunder, shaking every corner of the country, inspiring the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and setting off a high tide of grain production.

    Visiting the Valley Amidst the High Tide
    Amidst this thunderous spring and surging tide of agricultural production, the reporter visited the Berat District in the deep mountains and valleys of central and southern Albania. As the car just entered the center of Berat City, a towering mountain loomed before us, and an ancient castle overlooking the entire city suddenly appeared. Around it, from bottom to top, were built terraces of golden fields, like a ladder erected to climb the castle. These terraces were newly built not long ago, and fruit trees were planted on them. As the car continued along the mountain road, looking into the distance, neat terraces appeared on the majestic mountains and undulating hills. In the mountains shrouded in white clouds, one could see golden virgin land newly reclaimed. On the slopes on both sides of the river valley, fish-scale pits made of stones and wooden fences under each fruit tree adorned the mountains, resembling huge schools of carp crowded together. From the plains of the gorge and the valleys, the roar of tractors deep-plowing the land could be heard continuously.

    This beautiful scene is the fruitful result of the Labor Party Central Committee's call last October for the masses to participate in the discussion of the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970). The broad masses of members in Berat District responded to the Party's call, carried forward the spirit of the working people who dare to think and dare to do, and put forward many initiatives and measures to increase production. They turned the winter slack season into a busy winter season, launching a vigorous winter production campaign. In just a few months, they reclaimed 753 hectares of wasteland, completing and overfulfilling the wasteland reclamation plan ahead of schedule.

    The Wind Blowing from Dazhai
    Last winter and this spring, the members of this district also launched a movement to learn from the experience of Dazhai in China, building terraces on a large scale, erecting stone walls, and building fences to prevent soil erosion and transform hills and ridges into fertile fields. In order to learn from Dazhai's experience, the Labor Party District Committee first gathered leading cadres at all levels to watch the Chinese film "The Road of Dazhai," and then Party leaders made mobilization reports and organized study and discussion meetings. Later, the film was sent to every village for screening, and all members were organized to watch it. Based on extensive discussions among the masses, each village also organized special teams to build terraces and formulated plans to transform areas with severe soil erosion into terraces. Thus, a large-scale battle to build terraces was launched. The members braved thorns and thistles, worked day and night, faced the biting cold wind, and braved the winter cold, with revolutionary soaring enthusiasm, transforming 1,800 hectares of slopes into terraces in just a few months.

    Last winter and this spring, the members also promoted China's experience in using human manure as fertilizer and launched a campaign to accumulate organic fertilizer on a large scale.

    The Party Central Committee's call to "go to the main battle lines, go to the production battle lines" and the exemplary actions of the leading cadres of the District Party Committee encouraged the broad cadres of Berat District. They expressed their determination to go to the forefront of agricultural production and contribute their strength to increasing grain production. The leaders of the Berat District Party Committee selected 80 outstanding Party workers and agricultural experts to go to the countryside. Among them, 18 were elected as chairmen of agricultural production cooperatives. In response to the Party's call to develop agriculture, more than 1,000 workers and urban residents returned to their hometowns to participate in agricultural production. In addition, 300 cadres from the management institutions of the 45 agricultural cooperatives in the district also volunteered to become ordinary members, directly participating in production labor, adding strength to the forefront of agricultural production.

    Not Letting an Inch of Land Go to Waste
    The car passed through the gorge and turned into a pocket-shaped valley. On a high ridge in the center of the valley, there was a red brick house, which was the management committee of the "Kutalli" Agricultural Production Cooperative. After the chairman of the cooperative, Bitri, understood our intentions, he immediately led us to climb a small,馒头-shaped hill, about 200 meters away from the management committee, with terraces built around it. Before us was a plain surrounded by mountains. Cross-cutting drainage ditches were neatly distributed on this black, oily land. Bitri told us that this cooperative was a large cooperative with seven natural villages and 2,300 hectares (1 hectare equals 15 mu) of cultivated land. The Party's call of "not letting an inch of land be uncultivated, not letting an inch of land be unutilized" inspired the fighting spirit of the cooperative's 4,300 members. Last winter, a series of suggestions for developing and utilizing land were put forward at large and small gatherings, forming a surge of asking for land from barren mountains and wild ridges and seeking grain from mudflats. Last winter and this spring, the cooperative built 190 hectares of terraces, reclaimed 89 hectares of wasteland, and turned up the edges of fields, expanding 24 hectares of fertile land. In order to prevent soil erosion, 2,500 trees were also planted.

    Bitri said that in this struggle to conquer nature, the members fought with "gods and monsters" and "God" for land. He pointed to the mirror-like field in front of us and said that it was originally a chaotic mudflat. During the spring floods and rainy seasons, it was almost an ocean, isolating many villages from the outside world. And in the dry season, the mud was as hard as stone. Over the years, countless cattle had been trapped in the mudflats and swallowed up during the spring floods and rainy seasons. There was a legend that they were sacrifices demanded by "gods and monsters." Last winter, under the leadership of the Party organization, they decided to break superstitions and transform this swamp. Taking advantage of the dry season in early winter, the collective strength of the agricultural cooperative was mobilized to start a battle to subdue the "gods and monsters." In the middle of the mudflat, a main drainage ditch several meters deep and wide and several kilometers long was dug, and from this main ditch, countless branch ditches and tributary ditches were dug, extending in all directions as neatly as veins. The main drainage ditch was also connected to a large-scale irrigation canal built by the state, which could drain water during the rainy season and divert water for irrigation during the dry season. After several months of hard fighting by the members, more than 50 hectares of fertile land that guaranteed harvest regardless of drought or flood were seized from the "gods and monsters."

    Conquering "God's Territory"
    The battle to subdue the "gods and monsters" ignited the vigorous fighting flame of the broad masses of members of the "Kutalli" Agricultural Cooperative. During the discussion of the Party Central Committee's call, someone proposed to build terraces on the small hill towering in the center of the cooperative. At the very top of this small hill, there had been a Catholic church many years ago. This made this small hill become a "forbidden zone," and even shepherds dared not let their flocks invade this "God's territory."

    In January of this year, a 200-member terrace team sounded the war drums to attack this "God's territory." After two months of hard fighting, this "forbidden zone" was finally transformed into six hectares of neat terraces.

    After several months of hard work, the members of the "Kutalli" Agricultural Cooperative made it possible for them to expand the planting area of food crops by 300 hectares this year, and they also adopted the measure of planting grain on the plains and economic crops on the mountains. The members also suggested planting corn on the wheat fields after the wheat harvest to expand the double-cropping area to 160 hectares. This measure alone could increase grain production by 1,200 quintals (1 quintal equals 200 jin). They also planted 25 hectares of corn and 15 hectares of potatoes in the open spaces between fruit trees.

    Standing on the top of this small hill, a magnificent picture was displayed before us. In the fields crisscrossed by canals, in the green wheat fields swaying in the wind, the members were repairing fields and managing embankments, fertilizing the wheat fields, and pruning fruit trees. The red glow of the setting sun covered the earth with a layer of golden clothes. On this grand blueprint embroidered by the hands of the Albanian working people, shines the brilliant victory of the Albanian Labor Party's policy of self-reliance and large-scale grain production.

### 不平常的春天

    不平常的春天
    一九六六年的春天，在阿尔巴尼亚人民的心中，是一个不平常的春天。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党提出的自力更生、大力发展农业生产、争取全国粮食自给的号召，象一声春雷，震动了全国每一个角落，激发了广大人民的积极性，掀起了一个热火朝天的增产粮食的高潮。
    高潮声中访山谷
    在这春雷震荡、热潮滚滚的农业生产高潮中，记者访问了阿尔巴尼亚中南部高山深谷中的培拉特区。当汽车刚刚开到培拉特市中心，在迎面一座耸入云霄的山峦上，一座俯视全城的古堡突然呈现在我们眼前。在它的周围，从下到上，筑起了一级级金色的梯田，好象是为攀登古堡而架起的云梯。这些梯田是不久以前才修的，其中还栽上了果树。当汽车沿着山间公路继续前进时，举目远眺，在那巍峨的群山和起伏的丘陵上，一块块修砌整齐的梯田映入眼帘。在白云缭绕的山腰里可以看到一片片金黄色的新开垦的处女地。在河谷两岸的山坡上，棵棵果树下用石头垒起和木栅栏围起的鱼鳞坑，把群山点缀得好似拥挤在一起的巨大的鲤鱼群。从峡谷的平野上和山谷里不断传来正在进行深翻土地的拖拉机的轰鸣声。
    眼前这幅美丽的画面就是劳动党中央去年十月发表的关于人民群众参加讨论第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○）的号召书所结出的丰硕果实。培拉特区的广大社员响应党的号召，发扬了劳动人民敢想敢干的精神，提出了许多倡议和增产措施。他们变冬闲为冬忙，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的冬季大生产运动。仅仅用了几个月的时间就开垦了荒地七百五十三公顷，提前和超额完成了开荒计划。
    从大寨吹来的风
    去冬今春，这个区的社员还开展了一个大学中国大寨经验的运动，大修梯田，大垒石墙，大筑栅栏，以防止水土流失，把丘陵高岭改造成为良田。为了学习大寨的经验，劳动党区委会首先召集各级党政领导干部观看中国的《大寨之路》这部影片，并且由党的领导同志作了动员报告，组织学习讨论会。以后又把这部影片送到每一个村去放映，组织全体社员观看。还在群众广泛讨论的基础上，每个村都组织了修筑梯田的专门小组，制订了把水土严重流失地区改造为梯田的规划。于是一个大规模的修筑梯田的战斗开展起来了。社员们披荆斩棘，披星戴月，迎着刺骨的冷风，冒着冬日的严寒，以革命的冲天干劲，在仅仅几个月的时间里，把一千八百公顷的坡地等改变成了梯田。
    去冬今春，社员们还推广了中国使用人粪尿做肥料的经验，开展了大积有机肥的运动。
    党中央的“到主要战线去，到生产战线去”的号召和区党委领导干部的以身作则，鼓舞了培拉特区的广大干部。他们纷纷表示，决心到农业生产第一线去，为增产粮食贡献出自己的力量。培拉特区党的领导选派了八十名优秀的党的工作者和农业专家到农村去。他们当中有十八人被选为农业生产合作社的主席。为了响应党的发展农业的号召，还有一千多名工人和城市居民回乡参加农业生产。此外，全区四十五个农业社管理机构中的三百名干部也自愿当普通社员，直接参加生产劳动，为农业生产第一线增加力量。
    不让一寸土地荒废
    汽车穿过峡谷，拐进了一个口袋形的山谷，在山谷中央的一个高岗上，有一座红色的砖房，这就是“库塔里”农业生产合作社管理委员会。社主席比特问明我们的来意后，立即领我们爬上距离管委会只有二百米左右的一座周围已筑成层层梯田的馒头形小山。呈现在我们眼前的是一块群山环抱的平原。纵横交错的排水渠整齐地分布在这块黑油油的土地上。比特告诉我们，这个社是拥有七个自然村、二千三百公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）耕地的大社。党的“不让一寸土地不耕种，不使一寸土地不利用”的号召，鼓舞了全社四千三百名社员的斗志，去年冬天，在大小集会上，提出了一系列开发和利用土地的建议，形成了一个向荒山野岭要田，向泥潭索粮的热潮。在去冬今春，全社修了一百九十公顷梯田，开垦了八十九公顷荒地，并翻起了田头地角，扩大了二十四公顷良田，为了防止水土流失，还栽植了二千五百棵树。
    比特说，社员们在这场征服大自然的斗争中，同“神怪”和“上帝”进行了争夺土地的战斗。他遥指我们面前的这块一平如镜的田地说，这原是一片乱泥潭，在春汛和雨季，这儿几乎是一片汪洋，使得很多村子和外界隔绝。而在干旱时节，泥地又如同石块般坚硬。历年春汛和雨季不知有多少条牛陷进泥潭而被吞没。有过这样的传说：它们是被“神怪”索去的祭品。去年冬天，在党组织的领导下，决心破除迷信，改造这块沼泽地。利用冬初干燥时期，动员农业社的集体力量，开始了一场制服“神怪”的战斗。在纵贯泥潭的中间，挖了一条深宽数米、长达数公里的总排水渠，从这条主渠又挖掘无数条分渠、支渠，纵横整齐地如同脉络一样，伸向四面八方。总排水渠又同附近的一条国家兴建的大型灌溉渠衔接起来，雨季可以排涝，旱时又可以引水灌田。经过社员们几个月的艰苦战斗，从“神怪”手中夺得了五十多公顷旱涝保收的肥沃的田地。
    征服“上帝的领土”
    制服“神怪”的战斗燃起了“库塔里”农业社广大社员旺盛的斗争火焰。在讨论党中央号召书的过程中，有人提议把耸立在合作社中心的这座小山修成梯田。这座小山的正顶端，在许多年以前曾经有过一座天主教堂。这样就使这座小山曾经变成了“禁地”，就连牧羊人也不敢让他的羊群侵犯这块“上帝的领土”。
    今年一月间，一个二百人的梯田队敲响了向这块“上帝的领土”进攻的战鼓。经过两个月的艰苦奋战，终于把这块“禁地”变成了六公顷整齐的梯田。
    “库塔里”农业社社员们经过几个月的艰苦劳动，使得他们有可能在今年就把粮食作物的播种面积扩大三百公顷，而且采取了平地种粮，经济作物上山的措施。社员们还建议，麦收后在麦地上种上玉米，把双熟种植面积扩大到一百六十公顷，仅仅这项措施就可以增产一千二百公担（一公担合二百市斤）粮食。他们还利用果树中间的空地，多种了二十五公顷玉米和十五公顷土豆。
    我们站在这座小山的顶上，展示在我们面前的是一幅壮丽的图画。在那水渠纵横的田野上，迎风摆动的绿油油的麦田里，社员们正在修田理堰，为麦田施肥，为果树剪枝。夕阳的红光，为大地披上了一层金灿灿的衣裳。在这幅由阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民的双手绣成的宏图上，闪烁着阿尔巴尼亚劳动党自力更生、大搞粮食生产的政策胜利的光辉。
