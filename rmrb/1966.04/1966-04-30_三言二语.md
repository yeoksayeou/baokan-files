    A Few Words
    Who Underestimates Whose Determination?
    U.S. Secretary of State Rusk is again harping on those anti-China clichés. On the one hand, he hypocritically says that the United States has "no interest in going to war with China," and on the other hand, he clamors that China "may underestimate our resolve." His purpose is nothing more than to cover up for the U.S. policy of "gradual escalation" of the war. This kind of trickery cannot fool anyone.
    Frankly speaking, no matter how Rusk and his ilk play their tricks, the Chinese people have never, and will never, underestimate the "determination" of U.S. imperialism to expand the war. We have long been prepared for everything to oppose American aggression. It seems that the decision-makers in Washington still lack a sufficient estimate of the Chinese people's determination to resolutely resist American imperialist aggression. This is destined to bring them misfortune.
    How to Salvage "Reputation"?
    The *Indian Express* recently lamented that India's image abroad has been "seriously damaged," and sadly pointed out that "a series of events" since India launched an invasion on the Sino-Indian border in 1962 "accelerated the process of reputation decline."
    What the *Indian Express* says is all true. However, this newspaper believes that the "only way" to change India's image is to be "friendly" with the United States and help it implement a policy "aimed at containing China."
    Everyone knows that the "series of events" that the *Indian Express* dares not explicitly mention are nothing more than relying on the United States and engaging in anti-China activities. Now, the *Indian Express* is even advocating further reliance on the United States and intensifying anti-China activities. What will happen to India's "reputation" if this continues? Isn't that perfectly clear?

    三言二语
    谁低估谁的决心？
    美国国务卿腊斯克又重弹那一套反华的滥调。他一方面假惺惺地说什么美国“没有兴趣同中国交战”，另一方面又叫嚷中国“可能低估我们的决心”。其目的无非是要为美国“逐步升级”的战争政策打掩护。这种鬼把戏是迷惑不了人的。
    老实说，不管腊斯克之流怎样耍花招，中国人民从来没有，也永远不会低估美帝国主义扩大战争的“决心”。为了反对美国侵略，我们早已作好一切准备。看来，倒是华盛顿的决策者对于中国人民坚决抵抗美帝国主义侵略的决心，还缺乏足够的估计。这就注定了他们是一定要倒霉的。
    “声誉”怎样挽回？
    《印度快报》最近哀叹印度在国外的形象“严重遭到损害”，并且伤心地指出，自从一九六二年印度在中印边境发动侵略以来的“一系列事件加速了声誉下降的过程”。
    《印度快报》讲的都是实话。但是，这家报纸却认为改变印度形象的“唯一办法”，是同美国“友好”，帮助它推行“旨在遏制中国”的政策。
    谁都知道，《印度快报》所不敢明说的，加速印度声誉下降的“一系列事件”，不外是投靠美国，进行反华。现在，《印度快报》竟然鼓吹，要进一步投靠美国，加紧反华。这样下去，印度的“声誉”将会如何，这不是十分清楚的吗？
