　　Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd -- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on April 2nd, sent a note to the Indian Embassy in China, strongly protesting the Indian government's active pursuit of the U.S. imperialist plot of "Two Chinas," actually condoning and supporting Chiang gang elements in carrying out anti-China activities in India.

　　The note said that a so-called delegation headed by Li Guoding, the Chiang gang's pseudo-economic minister, and Shen Qi, the pseudo-vice minister of foreign affairs, is currently taking advantage of participating in the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East meeting in New Delhi to openly engage in anti-China activities in India. Indian political figures openly welcomed these Chiang gang elements and repeatedly held receptions for them, providing them with opportunities to carry out activities against the People's Republic of China. Both sides also loudly touted Indian and Chiang gang "understanding," "cooperation," and joint anti-China efforts. The president of the ruling Indian National Congress Party, Kamaraj, also met with Shen Qi, who invited him to visit Taiwan. Indian newspapers and news agencies vigorously promoted these Chiang gang elements, published their remarks opposing the motherland, and openly referred to Shen Qi as the "Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China." All these anti-China activities are being carried out with the condoning and support of the Indian government.

　　The note pointed out that this is another serious step by the Indian government to violate the norms of international relations, crudely interfere in China's internal affairs, and deliberately worsen bilateral relations, and is an open provocation against the Chinese people. For this, the Chinese government lodged a strong protest with the Indian government.

　　The note said that the Indian government's active pursuit of the U.S. imperialist plot of "Two Chinas" and its collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique that has usurped Taiwan has a long history. The Chinese government has repeatedly protested to the Indian government about this. However, the Indian government's collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique has not only not stopped, but has intensified and become even more blatant. In late January of this year, former Indian Member of Parliament, Velayudhan, was ordered to go to Taiwan to hold "talks" with Chiang gang leaders, touting the "normalization of diplomatic relations" between India and Chiang. He openly admitted that his "visit" to Taiwan was supported by the Indian Prime Minister. At the same time, the Indian government also allowed a Chiang gang delegation headed by Huang Chaoqin, in the capacity of a so-called government representative, to take advantage of attending the Pacific Area Travel Association conference in New Delhi to carry out anti-China propaganda such as "recovering mainland China." The Indian President even asked them to convey his "greetings" to Chiang Kai-shek, the public enemy of the Chinese people. Now, the Indian government has actually allowed the Chiang gang's pseudo-economic minister and vice-minister of foreign affairs to carry out anti-China activities in India on a large scale, which shows that the Indian government's collusion with the Chiang gang against China has reached a point where it is using every possible means.

　　The note said that the Indian government clearly knows that the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique is a political corpse, but still insists on colluding with them, which is nothing more than to further demonstrate to U.S. imperialism the Indian government's unwavering position of hostility towards China, so as to gain the reward of the United States. However, the Chinese government must solemnly warn the Indian government that your collusion with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to carry out activities against the People's Republic of China can only make the already deteriorated bilateral relations even worse. The Indian government must bear full responsibility for this.

　　Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd - New Delhi News: The Indian government is actively pursuing U.S. imperialism's conspiracy to antagonize China and create "Two Chinas," openly condoning and supporting Chiang gang elements in carrying out anti-China activities in New Delhi.

　　A so-called "delegation" headed by Li Guoding, the Chiang Kai-shek clique's pseudo-economic minister, and Shen Qi, the pseudo-vice minister of foreign affairs, arrived in New Delhi from Taipei on March 18th. It is reported that they are here to attend the "United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East" meeting. The meeting is attended by the Soviet Union, "Malaysia," the South Vietnamese puppet group, the South Korean puppet group, as well as the United States, Britain, and others. After arriving in New Delhi, this Chiang gang "delegation" was warmly received by the Indian ruling group.

　　The Indian authorities are using this opportunity to carry out ugly anti-China activities. Leading figures in Indian political, business, and financial circles are in frequent contact with Chiang gang elements, and both sides are touting the need to strengthen "understanding," "cooperation," and jointly oppose China.

　　According to the *Patriot* newspaper on March 25th, Kamaraj, the president of the ruling Indian National Congress Party, met with the pseudo-"Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs" Shen Qi on March 24th, and Shen Qi extended to Kamaraj a "invitation" hoping he would visit Taiwan.

　　On March 29th, Li Guoding and others attended a banquet held by the All India Management Association and held "talks" with Indian business and financial leaders.

　　Indian newspapers published news of the activities of Chiang gang elements, published their remarks opposing the motherland, carried out serious provocations against the Chinese people, and openly referred to Shen Qi as the "Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China."

### 我外交部强烈抗议印度政府追随美帝搞“两个中国”阴谋  正告印政府必须对恶化两国关系承担全部责任  蒋帮“代表团”到新德里竟受到热烈接待，双方公然鼓吹加强“合作”

    我外交部强烈抗议印度政府追随美帝搞“两个中国”阴谋
    正告印政府必须对恶化两国关系承担全部责任
    蒋帮“代表团”到新德里竟受到热烈接待，双方公然鼓吹加强“合作”
    新华社二日讯　中华人民共和国外交部四月二日照会印度驻华大使馆，强烈抗议印度政府积极追随美帝国主义搞
  “两个中国”的阴谋，竟然纵容和支持蒋帮分子在印度进行反华活动。
    照会说，一个以蒋帮伪经济部长李国鼎和伪外交部次长沈锜为首的所谓代表团，目前正利用参加新德里联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会会议的机会，在印度公开进行反华活动。印度政界人士公然对这些蒋帮分子表示欢迎，并一再为他们举行招待会，给他们提供进行反对中华人民共和国的活动的机会。双方并大肆鼓吹印度和蒋帮“谅解”、“合作”，共同反华。印度执政党国大党主席卡马拉季还接见了沈锜，沈锜邀请他去台湾访问。印度报刊、通讯社对这些蒋帮分子大力吹捧，发表他们反对祖国的言论，并公然称沈锜为“中华民国外交部次长”。所有这些反华活动，都是在印度政府的纵容和支持下进行的。
    照会指出，这是印度政府违反国际关系准则，粗暴干涉中国内政，蓄意恶化两国关系的又一严重步骤，是对中国人民的公开挑衅。为此，中国政府向印度政府提出强烈的抗议。
    照会说，印度政府积极追随美帝国主义搞“两个中国”的阴谋，同窃踞台湾的蒋介石集团进行勾结，由来已久。中国政府曾就此向印度政府多次提出抗议。但是，印度政府同蒋介石集团的勾搭不仅没有停止，反而变本加厉，更为嚣张。今年一月下旬，印度前国会议员维拉尤丹奉命前往台湾同蒋帮头目举行“会谈”，鼓吹印蒋“外交关系正常化”。他公开承认，他“访问”台湾是得到印度总理支持的。与此同时，印度政府还允许以所谓政府代表黄朝琴为首的蒋帮代表团，利用到新德里参加太平洋区旅行协会会议的机会，进行“收复中国大陆”等反华宣传。印度总统居然要他们向中国人民的公敌蒋介石致“问候之意”。现在，印度政府竟又允许蒋帮伪经济部长和外交部次长在印度大肆进行反华活动，这表明，印度政府勾结蒋帮反华，已经达到不择手段的地步。
    照会说，印度政府明明知道，台湾蒋介石集团是一具政治僵尸，但仍坚持同他们勾搭，这无非是为了向美帝国主义进一步表明印度政府死心塌地地敌视中国的立场，以便捞取美国的犒赏。但是，中国政府必须正告印度政府，你们勾结蒋介石集团，进行反对中华人民共和国的活动，只能使已经恶化的两国关系更加恶化。对此，印度政府必须承担全部责任。
    新华社二日讯　新德里消息：印度政府正积极追随美帝国主义敌视中国和制造“两个中国”的阴谋，公然纵容和支持蒋帮分子在新德里进行反华活动。
    一个以蒋介石集团伪经济部长李国鼎和伪外交部次长沈锜为首的所谓“代表团”三月十八日从台北来到了新德里。据报道，他们是来出席“联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会”会议的。这次会议有苏联、“马来西亚”、南越傀儡集团、南朝鲜傀儡集团以及美国、英国等参加。这个蒋帮“代表团”抵达新德里后，受到印度统治集团的热烈接待。
    印度当局利用这个机会进行丑恶的反华活动。印度政界、商界以及金融界的头面人物同蒋帮分子进行频繁的接触，双方鼓吹要加强“谅解”、“合作”，共同反华。
    据《爱国者报》三月二十五日说，印度执政党国大党主席卡马拉季在三月二十四日接见了伪“外交部次长”沈锜，沈锜向卡马拉季提出了希望他去台湾访问的“邀请”。
    三月二十九日，李国鼎等出席了全印经理人总协会举行的宴会，同印度商界、金融界头子进行了“会谈”。
    印度报纸登载了蒋帮分子活动的消息，发表他们的反对祖国的言论，对中国人民进行严重的挑衅，公然称沈锜为“中华民国外交部次长”。
