    According to soil science, land with excessive salt and alkali is unsuitable for cultivation. However, the soldiers of the Red Star No. 2 Farm of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps have reclaimed farmland on land with salt content ranging from tens of thousandths to four hundred thousandths and transformed it into stable and high-yield farmland. They have created a new paradigm for transforming nature.
    The soldiers of Red Star No. 2 Farm reclaimed land and established the farm in a place called Huoshi Spring in Hami. There were two types of wasteland there: wasteland with relatively low salinity and alkalinity, and severely saline-alkali land. The soil of severely saline-alkali land had a salt content of eighty to one hundred thousandths, with the most severe reaching four hundred and twenty thousandths. A layer of soil more than a foot thick was entirely composed of saline-alkali soil and mirabilite. The ground resembled a layer of frost and snow. Not to mention crops, even the most salt-tolerant camel thorn grass was sparse. Should they reclaim the mildly saline-alkali land, or the severely saline-alkali land? Reclaiming the mildly saline-alkali land would make it easier to build a farm, but it would occupy the reserve land for the local collective farmers to develop production. If they reclaimed the severely saline-alkali land, what method could they use to remove the foot-thick layer of salt and alkali? Could human power change such harsh natural conditions? The contradiction was thus sharply presented to the people.
    In the past, we risked our lives for the people; now, we still reclaim wasteland and establish farms for the people.
    The soldiers of Red Star No. 2 Farm came from the 47th Regiment of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Xinjiang. This unit of people's soldiers had repeatedly made military achievements in the War of Resistance Against Japan and the Liberation War, and was known for being good at fighting tough battles. They thought: in the past, risking our lives to bravely kill the enemy was for the people; now, reclaiming wasteland and running farms is still for the people. Therefore, they made a choice without hesitation: to reclaim the severely saline-alkali land, and leave the mildly saline-alkali land for the local peasant masses to gradually reclaim. They would transform the severely saline-alkali land like they attacked vicious class enemies. No matter how thick the saline-alkali layer, they would remove it.
    With such revolutionary red hearts and a pair of diligent hands, the soldiers of Red Star No. 2 Farm, with soaring revolutionary spirit, introduced water to wash away more than one million tons of salt, alkali, and mirabilite from more than 18,000 mu of saline-alkali land in Huoshi Spring, Hami, turning this saline-alkali land into fertile land. Nearly half of it has been transformed into stable and high-yield fertile land. In the thirteen years, they have produced more than 26.8 million jin of grain and a large amount of oil, sugar beets, and cotton on this land for the state. There was originally only one tree on this land, but now there are forest belts connected to forest belts, with about 160,000 trees growing inside and outside the farm, as well as 189 mu of peach, apricot, apple, and grape orchards. Horses, cattle, sheep, etc., have multiplied into herds from scratch. In 1953, the soldiers still used the pickaxes and round shovels used in battle to reclaim wasteland. Now, 89 percent of all farm work has been mechanized.
    "If you do revolution, you are not afraid of failure; without failure, there is no success."
    Huoshi Spring is backed by the vast Gobi Desert to the south and faces the towering Tianshan Mountains to the north. It is an extremely arid area. The annual rainfall is only 37 millimeters, while the evaporation reaches more than 3,400 millimeters; there are no rivers, no channels, let alone washing away alkali to plant crops, even drinking water for humans and animals is not available. In order to transform this large alkaline beach, the soldiers of Red Star No. 2 Farm, in the winter of 1951, carried their backpacks, shouldered pickaxes, and braved the wind and snow to go north to the Tianshan Mountains, cutting mountains and building dams, and repairing channels to divert water.
    This was an arduous project. The mouth of the Tianshan Mountains was 74 li away from Huoshi Spring. The diversion channel had to pass through a gravel Gobi Desert, and the channel had to be paved with stone blocks one by one. With heroic and tenacious spirit, the soldiers waged war against the Tianshan Mountains with steel drills and iron hammers. They could not stand on the cliffs and steep walls, so they tied ropes around their waists, hung down from the top of the mountain, and chiseled stones in the air. Their waists were marked with blood, and their arms were numb, but they said: What does it matter to suffer a little to build the border? In the absence of machinery and technical equipment, the soldiers relied on this tenacious revolutionary spirit to cut down mountains with their bare hands and build a large dam forty to fifty meters long at the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, completing the 74-li-long stone-lined water diversion channel in the Gobi Desert ten months ahead of schedule.
    After bringing in the snow water from the Tianshan Mountains, in the spring of 1953, they immediately launched a wasteland reclamation movement. The first step was to wash away the salt and alkali. In addition to the particularly heavy saline-alkali layer on the ground, there was also a layer of solid mirabilite about half a foot thick below, like a boundless slab of stone. About 50 tons of mirabilite and salt and alkali could be dug out from each mu of land. Compared with water conservancy construction, this was a more severe test.
    The soldiers who had just moved from the flames of war to production had no experience in reclaiming such heavily saline-alkali beaches. After digging drainage ditches and preparing the field ridges, the floodwater entered the field and washed away the field ridges completely overnight.
    Instructor Li Shengyou, who had participated in the Battle of Yan'an, raised his fist at the meeting and said: "If you do revolution, you are not afraid of failure; without failure, there is no success. There are no difficulties that cannot be overcome in front of the People's Liberation Army!" With their spirits boosted, the soldiers were like they were on the battlefield. Li Shengyou led people to re-dig the drainage ditches. He took off his cotton coat and took the lead in working hard, and the soldiers followed one after another, and finally dug through the drainage ditches before the water arrived.
    Starting a business on the saline-alkali beach was very hard. Here, every hundred jin of soil contained forty to fifty jin of salt and alkali, which dissolved into a red-black color when exposed to water. The more than 18,000 mu of land they washed subsided by more than a foot. How much labor did they put in to reclaim every inch of land!
    "Where salt and alkali attack, we will eliminate them there."
    After large-scale investment in production, Red Star No. 2 Farm, due to failing to fully understand the complexity of saline-alkali control, failed to follow up with timely control, and salt and alkali made a comeback. In 1956, about 4,000 mu of the farm's nearly 10,000 mu of cultivated land returned to saline-alkali, making it impossible to grow crops. Even in the land that could be cultivated, there were patches of white spots. Due to salt and alkali erosion, there were too many missing seedlings, and the yield per unit area of grain crops this year was less than 100 jin. Another serious question was raised to the people: would salt and alkali drive people away, or would people drive away salt and alkali?
    The farm Party committee held a series of meetings to discuss, and the conclusion was: mobilize the masses, learn lessons from failures; resolutely struggle to overcome saline-alkali disasters. The farm Party committee told everyone: "This is our position. Where salt and alkali attack, we will eliminate them there." Immediately afterwards, the entire farm conducted inspections, summarized experiences and lessons, and united to counter the attack of salt and alkali.
    Labor model Yang Zhenguo was so anxious that he couldn't sleep, and he was thinking day and night about how to eliminate the salt and alkali in the wheat field. One day, on the ground that had been swept of alkali, he saw that the ground was solid, so he raked it with an iron rake, and the next day it did not return to alkali. He tried several places, and it was the same. The farm director and political commissar heard the news and immediately rushed to the land managed by Yang Zhenguo. After observation and research, they found the scientific reason: salt and alkali rise to the surface with groundwater through capillaries. Raking the ground cuts off the capillaries and prevents the return of alkali.
    Through on-site meetings and publicity, a movement to learn from Yang Zhenguo's revolutionary spirit and scientific methods was launched throughout the farm. Many soldiers used their rest time to make anti-alkali rakes, and soon everyone had one. From then on, Red Star No. 2 Farm was no longer afraid of the return of alkali after rain. Large areas of land that did not produce seedlings grew good crops again.
    Mobilizing the masses to find solutions blocked the roads of salt and alkali counterattack one by one. After several years of struggle, a large area of bad land that had been eroded by salt and alkali was transformed back into good land.
    "Rather sweat a thousand drops more than harvest one jin less of grain for the country."
    By 1961, the soldiers of Red Star No. 2 Farm had effectively stopped the attack of salt and alkali and had expanded farmland to the alkaline beach, and production had been rising year by year. At this time, they set higher demands for themselves: to create high yields on severely saline-alkali land. They said: "Rather sweat a thousand drops more than harvest one jin less of grain for the country." From then on, "a thousand drops of sweat for one jin of grain" became the action slogan of all the soldiers on the farm.
    They found that the more manure and grass fertilizer applied, the better the crops grew; applying more manure and grass fertilizer had the effect of resisting salt and alkali and improving the soil, so they made applying more manure and grass fertilizer an important way to create high yields on saline-alkali land. A heat wave of accumulating fertilizer was set off throughout the farm. The soldiers went out with manure baskets, and many people ran one to two hundred li to the Tianshan pasture to dig sheep manure. In order to solve the problem of fertilizer sources, the farm actively developed animal husbandry and implemented a combination of agriculture and animal husbandry. The average amount of fertilizer applied per mu of farmland increased from more than 1,900 jin to more than 3,500 jin. As a result of years of applying large amounts of manure and grass fertilizer, nearly 9,000 mu of the farm's more than 18,000 mu of cultivated land has been transformed into stable and high-yield fields.
    In the struggle to achieve stable and high yields, the farm did not let go of every creation of the masses, and transformed the advanced thinking of model figures into the actions of the masses. In the process of promoting intensive cultivation to achieve high yields, the farm took Xue Xingyu, a second-level labor model of the corps, as an example to encourage all the soldiers on the farm, so that the entire farm established a style of striving for perfection in cultivation for the revolution. As a result of intensive cultivation, the area of stable and high-yield fields became larger and larger, and grain increased year by year. In 1965, Red Star No. 2 Farm encountered natural disasters such as drought and insects that had not been seen for many years. The average yield per mu of more than 10,000 mu of spring wheat still reached 406 jin, and the total output increased by more than one and a half times compared with 1961.

    英雄征服火石泉
    农垦系统一面红旗——红星二场建场史
    根据土壤学，含盐碱过多的土地是不能耕种的。但是，新疆生产建设兵团红星二场的战士们，却在含盐达千分之几十到千分之四百以上的土地上垦出农田，并把它改造成了稳产高产农田。他们创造了改造大自然的新范例。
    红星二场的战士是在哈密一个叫火石泉的地方垦荒建场的。这里有两种荒地，一种是盐碱较轻的荒地，一种是重盐碱地。重盐碱地的土壤含盐量达千分之八十到一百，最重的达千分之四百二十。一尺多厚的土层全是盐碱土和芒硝，大地就象蒙上了一层霜雪，不要说庄稼，连极耐盐碱的骆驼刺草也稀稀落落。是开垦轻盐碱地呢，还是开垦重盐碱地？开垦轻盐碱地容易建成农场，却占了当地集体农民发展生产的后备地带。开垦重盐碱地，有什么办法揭去尺把厚的盐碱壳呢？凭人力能改变这样恶劣的自然条件吗？矛盾就是这样尖锐地摆在人们面前。
    过去是为人民舍死忘生，现在还是为人民垦荒办场
    红星二场的战士，来自中国人民解放军进驻新疆的某部四十七团。这支人民子弟兵，在抗日战争、解放战争中屡建战功，以善打硬仗闻名。他们想：过去舍死忘生，英勇杀敌，是为人民；现在垦荒办农场，还是为人民。因此，他们毫不犹豫地作了选择：开垦重盐碱地，把轻盐碱地留给当地农民群众去逐步开垦。他们要象打击凶恶的阶级敌人一样，来改造重盐碱地，再厚的盐碱层，也要把它揭掉。
    红星二场的战士们就凭这样的革命红心和一双勤劳的手，以冲天的革命干劲，从哈密火石泉的一万八千多亩盐碱地上，引水洗去一百多万吨盐、碱和芒硝，使这些盐碱地变成了良田，其中近一半被改造成稳产高产的良田。十三年中，他们在这片土地上为国家生产出二千六百八十多万斤粮食和大量油料、甜菜和棉花。这片土地上原来只有一棵树，如今林带接林带，场里场外长起了约十六万株树，还有一百八十九亩桃、杏、苹果和葡萄园。马、牛、羊等从无到有，繁殖成群。一九五三年，战士们还是用打仗的十字镐、圆头锨开荒的，如今农场全部耕作已经有百分之八十九实现了机械化。
    “干革命就不怕失败，没有失败就没有成功”
    火石泉南靠浩瀚的戈壁，北临高大的天山，是个异常干旱的地区。年降雨量只有三十七毫米，而蒸发量却达三千四百多毫米；没有河流，没有渠道，不要说洗碱种地，连人畜饮水也没有。红星二场的战士为了改造这片大碱滩，在一九五一年冬季，就背着背包，扛着十字镐，顶风冒雪，北上天山，劈山筑坝，修渠引水。
    这是一项艰巨的工程，天山口离火石泉有七十四里远，引水渠要经过砾石戈壁，要用块石一块一块铺砌渠道。战士们以英勇顽强的气概，用钢钎、铁锤向天山开战。悬崖陡壁，站不住人，他们就腰系绳子，从山顶上吊下来，悬在空中凿石头。腰上勒成血印，手臂震得发麻，但是他们说：为了建设边疆，吃点苦算什么。在没有机器和技术设备的情况下，战士们依靠这股顽强的革命干劲，用双手劈掉了一座座山头，在天山脚下修起长达四五十米的拦河大坝，提前十个月在戈壁滩上修成七十四里长的浆砌石头引水渠。
    引来天山雪水之后，一九五三年春天，紧接着展开了开荒造田运动，头一步工作是洗净盐碱。除了地面的特重盐碱层，下面还有一层约半尺厚的固体芒硝，就象一块无边的大石板。每一亩地可以挖出约五十吨芒硝和盐碱。比起修水利，这是一场更为严峻的考验。
    刚从战火中转到生产上的战士，对开垦这样盐碱特重的荒滩，没有经验。挖成排碱沟，打好田硬，大水进地，一夜之间就把田硬冲得精光。
    参加过延安保卫战的指导员李胜有在会上举着拳头说：“干革命就不怕失败，没有失败就没有成功，在人民解放军面前没有克服不了的困难！”气鼓足了，战士们就象上了战场。李胜有带人重挖排碱沟。他脱掉棉衣带头猛干，战士们一个跟一个跟上去，终于在水到之前，把排碱沟挖通了。
    在盐碱滩上创业是十分艰苦的。这里每百斤土中含有四十来斤盐碱，遇水溶成红黑色。他们洗过的一万八千多亩土地，平地下陷了一尺多。他们每开垦一寸土地，付出了多么大的劳动！
    “盐碱从哪里进攻，我们就把它消灭在哪里”
    在大规模投入生产之后，红星二场由于没有摸透治理盐碱的复杂性，没能及时跟踪治理，盐碱又卷土重来。一九五六年，全场近万亩耕地，有四千亩左右重返盐碱，不能种庄稼，能种的地里也出现一块一块的白斑。由于盐碱侵蚀，缺苗太多，这年粮食作物单位面积产量还不到一百斤。又一个严重的问题提到人们面前：是盐碱赶走人，还是人赶走盐碱？
    农场党委召开了一系列会议进行讨论，得出的结论是：发动群众，从失败中找教训；坚决斗争，战胜盐碱灾害。农场党委向大家说：“这是我们的阵地，盐碱从哪里进攻，我们就把它消灭在哪里。”紧接着，在全场进行了检查，总结经验教训，上下拧成一股劲，反击盐碱的进攻。
    劳动模范杨振国急得睡不好觉，白天黑夜都在想怎样消灭麦地里的盐碱。有一天，他在扫过碱的地上，看到地面踏实了，就用铁耙耙了一遍，第二天竟没返碱，连试了几个地方，都是如此。场长、政委听到这消息，立刻赶到杨振国管的那块地里，经过观察研究，找到了科学道理：盐碱是随地下水顺毛细管上升到地面的，耙地切断了毛细管，防止了返碱。
    通过现场会议和宣传，在全场展开了学习杨振国的革命精神和科学方法的运动，许多战士利用休息时间，制作防碱耙，不久就做到了人手一把。从此，红星二场再也不怕雨后返碱了。大片不出苗的地，又长出了好庄稼。
    发动广大群众找门路，把盐碱反攻的路一条一条的堵死了。经过几年的斗争，一大片昔日被盐碱侵蚀了的坏地，又重新变成了好地。
    “宁愿多流千滴汗，也为国家多收一斤粮”
    到一九六一年，红星二场的战士们已经有效地制止了盐碱的进攻，并且向碱滩扩展了农田，生产逐年上升。这时候他们又给自己提出了更高的要求：在重盐碱地上创造高产。他们说：“宁愿多流千滴汗，也为国家多收一斤粮。”从此，“千滴汗，一斤粮”就成了全场战士的行动口号。
    他们发现，粪肥草肥上得多，庄稼长得好；多施粪肥草肥，有抵制盐碱改良土壤的作用，于是就把多施粪肥草肥作为盐碱地创造高产量的一条重要途径。全场掀起了积肥热潮。战士们出门不离粪筐，很多人跑出一二百里路到天山牧场上去挖羊粪。为了解决肥源问题，全场便积极发展畜牧业，实行农牧业结合。农田平均每亩施肥量由一千九百多斤增加到三千五百多斤。连年大施粪草肥的结果，全场一万八千多亩耕地中，有近九千亩已经变成了稳产高产田。
    在争取稳产高产斗争中，农场不放过群众的每一项创造，使模范人物的先进思想变成了广大群众的行动。在推行实现高产的精耕细作的过程中，农场以兵团二级劳动模范薛兴玉为榜样，激励全场战士，使全场树立了为革命在耕作上精益求精的风气。精耕细作的结果，稳产高产田面积越来越大，粮食逐年增长。一九六五年，红星二场遇到了多年未有的旱、虫等自然灾害，一万多亩春小麦，平均亩产量仍然达四百零六斤，总产量比一九六一年增长一倍半还多。
