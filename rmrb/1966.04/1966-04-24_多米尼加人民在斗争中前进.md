    Today is the first anniversary of the Dominican people's April armed uprising and the beginning of the "Week of Solidarity with the Dominican People" for people all over the world. With infinite admiration, the Chinese people pay high tribute to the heroic Dominican people who are persisting in the anti-American patriotic struggle.

    A year ago, the Dominican patriotic soldiers and civilians launched an anti-American and anti-dictatorial armed uprising, overthrowing the Kavral traitorous dictatorial regime in one day and night, and severely hitting the US imperialist rule in the Dominican Republic. This armed uprising opened a new and glorious page in the history of the Dominican people's revolutionary struggle, greatly promoted the national democratic revolution movement in Latin America, and greatly encouraged the people of the world in their struggle against US imperialism.

    The Dominican people's armed uprising was immediately suppressed and interfered with by US imperialism. Only five days after the outbreak of the uprising, the Johnson administration blatantly sent tens of thousands of American invading troops to carry out naked armed intervention. While suppressing with heavy troops, US imperialism also played a series of political deception conspiracies such as so-called "ceasefire," "reconciliation," and piecing together a "provisional government" to divide and disintegrate the uprising forces. Despite the use of all means by US imperialism, apart from the disintegration of the "constitutional government" headed by the insurgent officer Camano, US imperialism has not been able to quell the Dominican people's struggle. Last December and this February, successive nationwide struggles involving tens of thousands or even more than one hundred thousand people broke out in the Dominican Republic. Over the past year, the Dominican people's anti-American patriotic struggle has developed in waves, one wave after another, rising again after falling.

    Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out twenty years ago: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. It looks like the reactionaries are terrible, but in fact they don't have much strength. Looking at the problem from a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries, but to the people." Over the past twenty years, this great truth has been confirmed countless times by the revolutionary struggles of the people of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the world. Today, in the end, whose strength is greater, imperialism or the revolutionary people; in the end, who is afraid of whom? For this question, people can not only draw the most convincing conclusions from the great victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-American patriotic struggle, but also draw correct answers from the development of the Dominican people's anti-American patriotic struggle over the past year.

    The Dominican Republic is a small island country with a population of just over three million, and it has long been under the control and enslavement of US imperialism. Under such circumstances, the Dominican people still dare to rise up against the most powerful and ferocious US imperialism in the world. In order to deal with the Dominican people's revolutionary struggle, US imperialism actually dispatched more than 30,000 invading troops, more than 40 warships, and more than 300 aircraft. However, US imperialism is still powerless in the face of the Dominican people's struggle. Even the American propaganda machine admits that the American invaders, facing the heroic people of the Dominican Republic, "feel terrified like earthworms in a chicken farm." The facts are very clear that in our era, it is not the power of imperialism that is strong, but the power of the revolutionary people; it is not the revolutionary people who are afraid of imperialism, but imperialism that is afraid of the revolutionary people.

    US imperialism looks powerful, but it is actually very weak. It carries out aggression and interference all over the world, and as a result, it finds itself surrounded by the revolutionary people of the world. South Vietnam alone has already left it overwhelmed. If there is a second or third South Vietnam, US imperialism will not be able to cope at all. It is precisely under this situation that as long as there is any disturbance in the world, US imperialism will be stretched thin and unable to cope. The development of the Dominican people's anti-American patriotic struggle fully exposes the extremely weak nature of US imperialism. Today, as long as the people of that country are not afraid of US imperialism, dare to struggle, and dare to win, the revolutionary cause of that country will be full of hope, and will be able to move towards victory through a difficult and tortuous road.

    In the final analysis, what US imperialism fears most is that the people of all countries truly awaken, take up arms, and embark on the road of armed struggle. Over the past year, US imperialism has played political deception tactics such as the so-called "reconciliation law" in the Dominican Republic, its purpose being to prevent the Dominican people from launching a revolutionary armed struggle. The American invading troops have tried every means to confiscate weapons from the Dominican patriotic soldiers and civilians. However, the Dominican people have not been fooled, and they still hold weapons in their hands. From their own struggle experience, they have increasingly deeply understood that without revolutionary armed forces, the people have nothing. Dominican revolutionary organizations such as the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" and the "Dominican People's Movement" have called on the people to take up guns and fight for the complete liberation of the motherland. The "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" once stated in a statement: "We can and must carry out people's armed struggle in urban and rural areas throughout the country, especially to involve peasants in armed struggle and drive out foreign oppressors."

    Today, US imperialism is not only sitting on a volcano in the Dominican Republic, but the entire Latin America is a powder keg. A revolutionary storm against US imperialism and its lackeys is roaring and sweeping across Latin America. There are already a series of Latin American countries with anti-American and anti-dictatorial armed struggles of varying scales. Although the armed struggle in many places is only a spark, revolutionary armed struggle will surely spread like wildfire.

    The Dominican people's revolutionary struggle is by no means isolated. They have received the sympathy and support of the people of Latin American countries, the people of Asia and Africa, and the revolutionary people of the world. The Chinese people firmly stand on the side of the Dominican people and support their just struggle. Comrade Mao Zedong once announced to the world: "The Chinese people firmly support the Dominican people's anti-American patriotic armed struggle. I firmly believe that as long as they rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in a protracted struggle, the Dominican anti-American patriotic struggle, with the support of the people of the world, will surely achieve final victory." Fight on, Dominican brothers! Advance, Latin American brothers! Final victory belongs to you. The future belongs to you.

### 多米尼加人民在斗争中前进

    多米尼加人民在斗争中前进
    今天是多米尼加人民四月武装起义的一周年，也是全世界人民“声援多米尼加人民周”开始的日子。我国人民怀着无限钦佩的心情，向坚持反美爱国斗争的英雄的多米尼加人民致以崇高的敬意。
    一年以前，多米尼加爱国军民举行了反美反独裁的武装起义，在一昼夜之间推翻了卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权，沉重地打击了美帝国主义在多米尼加的统治。这次武装起义，在多米尼加人民革命斗争的历史上揭开了新的光辉的一页，大大地推动了拉丁美洲的民族民主革命运动，并且给全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争以极大的鼓舞。
    多米尼加人民的武装起义，立即遭到美帝国主义的镇压和干涉。就在起义爆发后的第五天，约翰逊政府悍然派出几万名美国侵略军，实行赤裸裸的武装干涉。在重兵镇压的同时，美帝国主义又玩弄了所谓“停火”、“和解”、拼凑“临时政府”等一系列政治欺骗阴谋，来分化和瓦解起义队伍。尽管美帝国主义使用了一切手段，但是，除了以起义军官卡马诺为首的“宪法政府”被瓦解之外，美帝国主义并没有能够把多米尼加人民的斗争平息下去。去年十二月和今年二月，在多米尼加又连续爆发了有数万人以至于十万以上群众参加的全国性斗争。一年以来，多米尼加人民的反美爱国斗争，在波浪式地发展，一浪接着一浪，伏而又起。
    毛泽东同志曾经在二十年以前就明确地指出：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”二十年来，这个伟大的真理已经无数次地为亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界各国人民的革命斗争实践所证实。今天，帝国主义和革命人民，究竟是谁的力量强大，究竟是谁怕谁？对于这个问题，人们不仅能够从当前越南人民抗美救国斗争的伟大胜利中作出最有说服力的结论，而且从一年来多米尼加人民反美爱国斗争形势的发展中，也能够得出正确的答案。
    多米尼加是人口不过三百多万的一个小小的岛国，而且长期受着美帝国主义的控制和奴役。在这样的情况下，多米尼加人民仍然敢于起来反抗世界上最强大、最凶恶的美帝国主义。而美帝国主义为了对付多米尼加人民的革命斗争，竟然出动了三万多名侵略军、四十多艘军舰和三百多架飞机。但是，美帝国主义仍然在多米尼加人民的斗争面前无能为力。就连美国宣传机器也承认，美国侵略者面对着多米尼加英勇的人民，“象养鸡场里的蚯蚓一样感到心惊肉跳”。事实很清楚，在我们这个时代，不是帝国主义的力量强大，而是革命人民的力量强大；不是革命人民害怕帝国主义，而是帝国主义害怕革命人民。
    美帝国主义貌似强大，其实虚弱得很。它在全世界到处进行侵略和干涉，结果是使自己处于全世界革命人民的包围之中。仅仅一个南越，已经使它焦头烂额。如果出现第二个、第三个南越，美帝国主义就根本无法招架。正是在这种形势下，世界上只要有什么风吹草动，美帝国主义就捉襟见肘，穷于应付。多米尼加人民反美爱国斗争的发展，充分地暴露了美帝国主义这种极端虚弱的本质。今天，只要那个国家的人民不怕美帝国主义，敢于斗争、敢于胜利，那个国家的革命事业就大有希望，就能够经过艰巨曲折的道路，走向胜利。
    归根结底，美帝国主义最害怕的是各国人民真正觉悟，拿起武器，走上武装斗争的道路。一年来，美帝国主义在多米尼加玩弄所谓“和解法”等政治欺骗手法，它的目的就是要防止多米尼加人民发动革命的武装斗争。美国侵略军千方百计地企图从多米尼加爱国军民手中收缴武器。但是，多米尼加人民并没有上当，他们仍然掌握着武器。他们从自己的斗争经验中越来越深刻地懂得，没有革命的武装，就没有人民的一切。多米尼加“六月十四日革命运动”、“多米尼加人民运动”等革命组织，纷纷号召人民拿起枪杆子，为争取祖国的彻底解放而斗争。“六月十四日革命运动”曾经在声明中指出：“我们能够，也必须在全国城乡开展人民武装斗争，特别是使农民参加武装斗争，把外国压迫者赶出去”。
    今天，美帝国主义不仅在多米尼加坐在火山口上，而且整个拉丁美洲都是火药桶。一个反对美帝国主义及其走狗的革命风暴，狂啸怒吼，席卷着整个拉丁美洲。目前已经有一系列拉丁美洲国家存在着规模不同的反美反独裁武装斗争。尽管许多地方的武装斗争还只是星星之火，但是，革命武装斗争，一定会势如燎原的。
    多米尼加人民的革命斗争，决不是孤立的。他们得到了拉丁美洲各国人民、亚洲、非洲人民和全世界革命人民的同情和支持。中国人民坚决站在多米尼加人民的一边，支持他们的正义斗争。毛泽东同志曾经向全世界宣布：“中国人民坚决支持多米尼加人民反美爱国的武装斗争。我深信，只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，多米尼加的反美爱国斗争，在全世界人民的支持下，是一定能够取得最后胜利的。”战斗吧，多米尼加兄弟们！前进吧，拉丁美洲兄弟们！最后胜利一定属于你们。未来一定属于你们。
