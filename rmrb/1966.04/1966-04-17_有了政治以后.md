    After Having Politics…
    Shang De
    When we discuss the relationship between politics and production, business, and technology, we must not forget the relationship between politics and the masses.
    Chairman Mao said: “Politics is the politics of class, the politics of the masses, not the politics of so-called minority politicians.”
    In the past, the reactionary ruling class did not allow the masses to concern themselves with politics. Now, in our country, the masses are studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works in a living way, talking about politics, stressing politics, and using politics everywhere.
    How powerful will the masses be when they have politics? It is difficult for us to imagine this sitting in a room. Leaving aside the great achievements of changing the world and making inventions, let's just talk about two small things in daily life:
    In the past, when encountering family disputes, no matter how many people came to persuade and mediate, "each side had their own reasons," and it was always difficult to judge. Now that politics has been emphasized, it is different. In Luanzhuang Brigade, Zhuolu County, Hebei Province, there was a young woman who, in previous years, was content with "cooking and turning around the stove." Her mother-in-law had old ideas and didn't get along with her; her sister-in-law took her mother's side; her husband was caught in the middle, listening to one side one moment and the other the next, making family relations increasingly complicated, and they often fought and quarreled. Later, the Youth League branch guided her to study Chairman Mao's works. Politics gradually entered her mind, and first she was unwilling to be "backward" and wanted to make revolution; then she wanted to solve family conflicts, and automatically guided her sister-in-law, husband, and mother-in-law to also study Chairman Mao's works. As a result, Mao Zedong Thought unified the thinking of the whole family, and it became a new family of unity, mutual assistance, and "all-round red."
    Drought and water disputes have always been one of the most difficult "civil disputes" to resolve in rural areas. After collectivization, the situation improved a lot, but there were still many contradictions. A cadre of a production brigade in Yunxi Commune, Shifang County, Sichuan Province, said that in the past, they were busy dealing with the water disputes of various teams every year, and they could never finish dealing with them; last year, they did not rush to deal with water disputes, but instead everyone sat down to study "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and talked a lot about revolution. As a result, not only did no water disputes occur, but a new atmosphere of mutual help, mutual concession, unity, and friendship emerged.
    Politics commands business, most fundamentally because it can command people's thinking. Proletarian politics can not only command the thinking of a few people, but also command and concentrate the thinking and strength of the entire class, the entire country, and the revolutionary people of the world. "Correct ideas representing the advanced class, once grasped by the masses, become a material force for transforming society and transforming the world." When a person emphasizes politics, they will consciously transform themselves and transform the environment; when a family or a production brigade emphasizes politics, they will consciously handle contradictions correctly and work together for the revolution. Just imagine, what a scene it would be if every unit, every county, every province, and the entire country emphasized politics everywhere, and everyone was armed with Mao Zedong Thought? What a greater contribution our country will make to the world revolution!
    Proletarian politics is the politics of the masses. All reactionary ruling classes dare not let the masses concern themselves with politics, because they are anti-people. We, on the other hand, serve the people, and the purpose of our revolution is for the people, and we can only complete it by relying on the people. Revolution is the liberation of hundreds of millions of people themselves. We must emphasize politics everywhere, that is, to open the eyes of the masses and see the major affairs of the Party, the major affairs of the country, and the major affairs of the world. When the masses have proletarian politics in their minds and recognize the truth, everything will be easy to handle.

    有了政治以后……
    尚德
    我们在讨论政治和生产、业务、技术的关系的时候，切记不要忘了政治和群众的关系。
    毛主席说：“政治是指阶级的政治、群众的政治，不是所谓少数政治家的政治。”
    过去，反动统治阶级不让群众过问政治。现在，在我们国家里，群众活学活用毛主席著作，到处在谈政治、讲政治、用政治。
    群众有了政治，会有多大威力呢？这是我们坐在屋里很难想象的。且不说那改天换地、创造发明的丰功伟绩，只说两件日常生活中的小事：
    过去遇到家务纠纷这类事，多少人来劝说、调解，“公说公有理，婆说婆有理”，总是判断不清。如今突出了政治，不同了。河北省涿鹿县栾庄大队有个青年妇女，前几年是个满足于“做做饭、锅台转”的人。家里婆婆有旧思想，跟她不好；小姑子和妈一个鼻孔出气；丈夫夹在中间，东听一句，西听一句，家庭关系越来越复杂，经常打架吵嘴。后来，团支部引导她学习毛主席著作。她脑子里逐渐有了政治，首先不甘心“落后”，要革命了；接着她要解决家庭矛盾，自动引导小姑子、丈夫、婆婆也学习毛主席著作，结果毛主席的思想统一了全家人的思想，成了个团结互助、“满堂红”的新家庭。
    天旱争水，这也是历来乡间最难解决的“民事纠纷”之一。集体化后，情况好多了，但矛盾也不少。四川什邡县云西公社一个生产大队的干部说，过去他们每年忙着处理各队争水问题，总是处理不完；去年没有忙着处理争水问题，而是大家先坐下来学习《纪念白求恩》，大谈革命，结果不但没有发生争水纠纷，还出现了一片互帮互让、团结友爱的新风气。
    政治统帅业务，最根本的就是因为它能统帅人的思想。无产阶级政治不仅能统帅少数人的思想，而且能把整个阶级、整个国家和世界的革命人民的思想和力量都统帅起来、集中起来。“代表先进阶级的正确思想，一旦被群众掌握，就会变成改造社会、改造世界的物质力量”。一个人突出了政治，就会自觉地改造自己、改造环境；一个家庭、一个生产大队突出了政治，就会自觉地正确处理矛盾，齐心为革命出力。试想，每个单位、每个县、每个省、整个国家处处都突出了政治，人人都用毛泽东思想武装起来，那将会出现怎样一番景象？我们国家将会为世界革命做出多么更加伟大的贡献啊！
    无产阶级的政治就是群众的政治。一切反动统治阶级不敢让群众过问政治，因为他们是反人民的。而我们则是为人民服务的，我们革命的目的是为了人民，而且也只有依靠人民才能完成。革命就是千百万人民自己的解放事业。我们要处处突出政治，就是要使群众打开眼界，看到党的大事、国家的大事、世界的大事。群众脑子里有了无产阶级的政治，认识了真理，一切事情就好办了。
