    According to Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 1st: Nearly 8,000 locomotive firemen from eight major railway companies across the United States went on strike on the 31st to protest the management's rejection of the workers' demands for job security. The strike has affected 38 states in the United States, paralyzing more than 12 percent of the nation's rail network.
    This strike greatly shocked the U.S. ruling clique. Federal Judge Alexander Holtzoff in Washington issued an order that day, declaring the strike "illegal" under the pretext that "we are fighting a war," and ordered the workers to return to work immediately. After listening to a report from Labor Secretary Wirtz that morning, U.S. President Johnson decided to intervene personally and summon the union leaders. The "National Mediation Board," which specializes in undermining and sabotaging workers' strikes, also came forward to express its intention to intervene. However, the striking workers, disregarding the ruling clique's combination of soft and hard tactics, continued their struggle.
    According to Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington on the 2nd: Approximately 8,000 locomotive firemen from eight major railway companies in the United States continued their strike on the 1st, demanding job security, despite various pressures from the government.
    Late on March 31, U.S. Labor Secretary Wirtz held four hours of negotiations with union leaders. Wirtz's demand for an immediate return to work was rejected. On the 1st, the U.S. Court of Appeals further pressured the striking workers, actually declaring the previous injunction of the local court against the strike to be valid. However, the workers, disregarding the arbitrary interference of the judicial authorities, still persisted in their strike.
    It is reported that the firemen's strike has received the support of other employees of the eight major railway companies. These eight railway companies employ more than 160,000 workers.
    The impact of the strike is rapidly expanding. In Illinois, twenty carloads of ammunition destined for South Vietnam have been unable to be shipped out. The strike has also prevented the shipment of some agricultural products that the United States intends to dump abroad. Some factories of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler have been forced to suspend or reduce production due to the inability to transport automotive parts and new automobiles.

    美国近八千名火车司炉工人罢工
    全国八分之一铁路交通瘫痪　部分侵越军火运输停顿
    据新华社一日讯　华盛顿消息：美国各地八个大铁路公司的近八千名火车司炉工人，在三十一日罢工，抗议资方拒绝工人们关于保障就业的要求。罢工已波及美国三十八个州，使全国百分之十二以上的铁路交通网陷于瘫痪状态。
    这次罢工使美国统治集团十分震惊。在华盛顿的联邦法官亚历山大·霍尔佐夫当天下达命令，借口“我们正在打一场战争”宣布这次罢工为“非法”，并勒令工人们立即复工。美国总统约翰逊在当天上午听取了劳工部长沃兹的有关报告以后，决定亲自插手干涉，要召见工会领导人。专门从事瓦解和破坏工人罢工的“国家仲裁委员会”也出面表示要进行干预。但是，罢工工人不顾统治集团软硬兼施的手法，继续坚持斗争。
    据新华社二日讯　华盛顿消息：美国八家大铁路公司的大约八千名火车司炉工人不顾政府方面的种种压力，一日继续进行要求就业保障的大罢工。
    三月三十一日深夜，美国劳工部长沃兹同工会领导人进行了四小时的谈判。沃兹提出的立即复工的要求遭到了拒绝。一日，美国上诉法院又对罢工工人施加压力，竟宣布先前地方法院关于不准罢工的法令有效。但是工人们不顾司法当局的横蛮干涉，仍然坚持罢工。
    据报道，司炉工人的罢工获得了八家大铁路公司其他职工的支持。这八家铁路公司雇有十六万多工人。
    罢工的影响正在迅速扩大。在伊利诺斯州已经有二十车厢运往南越去的弹药无法运出。罢工也使美国准备在国外倾销的一些农产品无法启运。通用汽车公司、福特汽车公司和克莱斯勒汽车公司的一些工厂已由于汽车部件无法运进和新汽车无法运出而停工减产。
