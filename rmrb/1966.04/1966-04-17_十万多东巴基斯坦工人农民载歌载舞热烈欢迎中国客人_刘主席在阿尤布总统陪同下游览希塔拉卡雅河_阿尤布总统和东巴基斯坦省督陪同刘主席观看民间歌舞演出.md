    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 16th – Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, accompanied by President Ayub Khan, took a pleasant boat trip on the Sitalakhya River near Dhaka on the morning of the 16th. More than 100,000 East Pakistani workers and peasants sang, danced, and shouted slogans, giving the representatives of the Chinese people a colorful and moving welcome.
    As the two special yachts approached some jute mills and textile factories along both banks of the river, tens of thousands of workers climbed onto the roofs, the tops of barges, ran to the riverbank and docks, and some even waded or swam to meet the yachts, all waving enthusiastically, cheering, and applauding. Some people released balloons and doves, while others set off firecrackers. Countless joyful and enthusiastic crowds followed the yachts along the riverbank. The great friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples permeated this picturesque river.
    On both sides of the yachts, about twenty rowing boats sped along, each with forty-five rowers, all villagers wearing colorful clothes and turbans. They were participating in the annual traditional boat race. While rowing hard, they continuously shouted slogans of Sino-Pakistani friendship, sang folk songs, and beat gongs and drums. Amidst the constant cheers of the people on both banks, the entire river presented a scene of festive joy.
    All the boats were decorated with colored flags. One boat had a model of a cannon on top, representing the Pakistani people's determination to resist foreign aggression and safeguard national independence.
    Chairman Liu and President Ayub Khan waved to the welcomers and the rowers on the boats, who responded with even louder cheers. Tens of thousands of eyes watched the yachts; tens of thousands of hands waved to the leaders of the two friendly nations.
    On one of the special yachts, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese guests had cordial conversations with the Governor of East Pakistan Province, Abdul Monem Khan, Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, Pakistani Minister of Industry Altaf Hussain, Minister of Agriculture Shams-ud-Doha, and all the ministers of the East Pakistan Provincial Government.
    The Chinese guests began their boat trip at a pier in Narayanganj, about twelve miles south of Dhaka. As Chairman Liu, together with President Ayub Khan and Governor Abdul Monem Khan, traveled by car to Narayanganj, tens of thousands of peasants, students, and citizens, men, women, old, and young, lined up to welcome the Chinese guests. Many people also appeared on rooftops, walls, trees, railway bridges, and even railway signal poles and other high places to greet the Chinese guests. At all the intersections adorned with flags and pennants, various folk dances were performed.
    When Chairman Liu and his entourage arrived at the pier in Narayanganj, they were welcomed by the Dhaka District Commissioner and the Director of the East Pakistan Inland Water Transport Authority. They accompanied the distinguished Chinese guests on their tour.
    When Chairman Liu and his entourage returned to Dhaka by car after the tour, tens of thousands of people, despite the midday heat, once again gave them a warm welcome along the roadside.
    Narayanganj is the main inland river port of East Pakistan. The city has a population of 100,000 and is also the largest jute processing, sales, and export center in Pakistan. The factories of the largest jute processing plants and raw jute packaging plants in Pakistan, such as the Adamjee Jute Mills, are located on both banks of the Sitalakhya River.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 15th – Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, accompanied by President Ayub Khan and Governor of East Pakistan Province Abdul Monem Khan, watched folk song and dance performances here on the evening of the 15th.
    The performances included folk songs and dances from Chittagong, Sylhet, and other parts of East Pakistan. These folk songs and dances, with their beautiful rhythms, vitality, and rich, simple atmosphere of life, won continuous applause from the audience.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, as well as other members of the entourage accompanying Chairman Liu Shaoqi on his visit, also watched the performances.
    Also watching the performances were Pakistani Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, Minister of Communications Khan A. Sabur Khan, Minister of Engineering, Food and Agriculture Shams-ud-Doha, senior officials of the East Pakistan Provincial Government, and local celebrities from all walks of life.
    When Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage traveled by car to watch the performances and returned after watching the performances near midnight, dense crowds stood on both sides of the streets through which the motorcade passed, cheering the guests. The colored light bulbs decorating the buildings added festive splendor to the night in the capital of East Pakistan. (Attached photos)

    阿尤布总统和东巴基斯坦省督陪同刘主席观看民间歌舞演出
    新华社达卡十六日电　刘少奇主席和夫人在阿尤布·汗总统陪同下，十六日上午在达卡附近的希塔拉卡雅河上乘船作了一次愉快的游览。十万多东巴基斯坦工人和农民唱歌、跳舞、高呼口号，给中国人民的代表一次多采而动人的欢迎。
    当两艘专用游艇驶近沿河两岸一些黄麻厂和纺织厂时，成千上万的工人爬到屋顶上，驳船顶上，跑到河边和码头上，有的人甚至趟水或游泳向游艇迎过去，一个个都非常热情地招手、欢呼和鼓掌。有人升起了气球，放出鸽子，有人放起鞭炮。河岸上数不清的欢欣热情的人群跟着游艇走。在这条景色如画的河上洋溢着中巴两国人民的伟大友谊。
    在游艇两边，约有二十只划艇在疾驶，每只划艇上有四十五名划桨手，全都是穿着彩色衣服缠着头巾的村民。他们是在参加一年一度的传统赛船。他们一面奋力划桨，一面自始至终高呼中巴友好的口号，唱民间歌曲，敲锣打鼓。在两岸人们不断的欢呼声中，整个河面上呈现出一片节日的欢乐气氛。
    所有船上都装饰着彩旗。有一条船的顶上放着一尊大炮的模型，表示巴基斯坦人民抵抗外国侵略和维护民族独立的决心。
    刘主席和阿尤布·汗总统向欢迎者和船上划桨手们挥手致意，他们发出了更加响亮的欢呼声。成千上万双眼睛望着游艇；成千上万双手向两个友好国家的领导人招挥。
    在一艘专用游艇上，陈毅副总理和夫人、外交部副部长章汉夫和其他中国客人同东巴基斯坦省督阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗、外交部长布托和夫人、巴基斯坦工业部长阿塔弗·侯赛因、农业部长沙姆索多哈和东巴基斯坦省政府的所有部长们亲切交谈。
    中国客人是在达卡以南约十二英里的纳拉扬甘吉市的一个码头开始乘船游览的。当刘主席同阿尤布·汗总统和阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗省督一起，乘车前往纳拉扬甘吉市时，一路上，几万农民、学生和市民，男女老幼，列队欢迎中国客人。许多人还出现在屋顶上、墙上、树上、铁路桥梁上、甚至铁路信号杆上和其他高的地方，向中国客人致意。在挂满了旗帜和小旗的所有路口，表演了各种民间舞蹈。
    刘主席和他的随行人员到达纳拉扬甘吉的码头时，受到了达卡专区专员和东巴基斯坦内河航运局局长的欢迎。他们陪同中国贵宾游览。
    当刘主席和他的随行人员在游览后乘车返回达卡时，成千上万的人，不顾正午的炎热，在路旁再次给他们热诚的欢迎。
    纳拉扬甘吉是东巴基斯坦主要的内河港口。这个城市有十万人口，也是巴基斯坦最大的黄麻加工、销售和出口中心。巴基斯坦最大的阿达姆吉黄麻厂等黄麻加工厂和原麻打包厂的厂房都在希塔拉卡雅河的两岸。
    新华社达卡十五日电　刘少奇主席和夫人十五日晚上由阿尤布·汗总统和东巴基斯坦省督阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗陪同，在这里观看了民间歌舞演出。
    演出的节目包括吉大港、锡尔赫特和东巴基斯坦其他地方的民间歌舞。这些民间歌舞节奏优美，富有活力，并且充满浓厚、质朴的生活气息，博得了观众不断的掌声。
    陈毅副总理和夫人，陪同刘少奇主席访问的其他随行人员也观看了演出。
    观看演出的还有巴基斯坦政府外交部长布托和夫人，交通部长汗·阿·萨布尔·汗，工程、粮食和农业部长沙姆索多哈，东巴基斯坦省政府的高级官员和当地各界知名人士。
    当刘少奇主席和随行人员乘车前往观看演出和近午夜观看演出后回来的时候，密密层层的群众站在车队经过的街道两旁，向客人们欢呼。装饰在建筑物上的彩色灯泡，给东巴基斯坦首府的夜晚增添了节日的光辉。（附图片）
