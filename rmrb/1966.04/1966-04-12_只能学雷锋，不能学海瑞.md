    Only Learn from Lei Feng, Not from Hai Rui
    Five-Good Soldier of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army, Zha Qifa
    Comrade Wu Han, in works such as "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," used the despicable methods of insinuating the present by referring to the past and attacking indirectly to launch vicious attacks against the Party and socialism. I am extremely indignant about this. In particular, I am even more resentful of Comrade Wu Han for not only refusing to accept the criticisms raised by many comrades but also pretending to be confused and launching a counterattack. I am a revolutionary soldier, and I must resolutely defend the Party and socialism, and I will not allow Comrade Wu Han to slander and attack them.
    Why did Comrade Wu Han praise Hai Rui and dress him up as a "hero," wanting us to learn his "good virtues"? Comrade Wu Han's meaning is: Hai Rui was "brave," dared to "scold the emperor," he was "upright and unyielding," and did not lose heart or succumb even after being dismissed from office. Let's not even talk about whether Hai Rui really scolded the emperor or truly loved the emperor, let's not even talk about whether he was dismissed from office or gained office, and let's not even talk about whether he was a true "loyal minister" or a fake "incorruptible official." We are not historians and will not investigate it. Let's look at the author's intention from the era backgrounds in which the two works appeared. Comrade Wu Han seems to be very afraid of mentioning the word "background," so when people talk about similar issues, he hurriedly takes out his writing "timeline" to cover up. As a result, he revealed his flaws, trying to cover up only made things worse, and it was self-defeating. The fact is that no amount of flowery language can overthrow. When right-leaning opportunists and domestic and foreign demons and monsters set off an anti-Communist and anti-China wave, Comrade Wu Han released "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" from its cage. When the right-leaning opportunists' conspiracies were seen through by the people and were scolded by the people, Comrade Wu Han promoted "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." What a clever use of the past to serve the present! See, isn't the Hai Rui of the past precisely used for the right-leaning opportunists of today? Doesn't the emperor of the past precisely insinuate the Party Central Committee of today? This is Comrade Wu Han's ulterior motive. It is very clear that Comrade Wu Han wants people today to "learn the good virtues of the ancients," which is to tell the right-leaning opportunists who have been dismissed from office not to be afraid of "dismissal," not to be afraid of failure, and to try again after failing! Our Party is great, glorious, and correct. Every one of our soldiers is determined to be like Comrades Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Mai Xiande, with a red heart forever towards the Party, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, being good soldiers of Chairman Mao, and being successors of the revolution. We must give Comrade Wu Han's vicious conspiracy a firm counterattack.

    只能学雷锋，不能学海瑞
    解放军某部五好战士　乍启发
    吴晗同志在《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》等作品中，用借古非今、指桑骂槐的可耻手段，向党向社会主义进行恶毒攻击，我对此极为气愤。尤其是对吴晗同志不但不接受很多同志提出的批评，反而假装糊涂，进行反扑，更为痛恨。我是一个革命战士，我要坚决维护党和社会主义，不容许吴晗同志对它进行诬蔑和攻击。
    吴晗同志为什么将海瑞捧出来，并将他打扮成“英雄”，要我们去学习他的“好品德”？吴晗同志的意思是：海瑞“勇敢”，敢“骂皇帝”，他“刚直不阿”，罢了官仍不丧气，不屈服。且不说海瑞是真的骂皇帝，还是真的爱皇帝，且不说他是罢了官，还是得了官，也且不说他是真“忠臣”，还是假“青天”，咱不是史学家，不去考究它。咱且从两篇作品出现的时代背景，来看一下作者的意图。吴晗同志看来好象很怕提“背景”两个字，因而当人们谈到类似问题时，急忙将自己写作的“时间表”搬出来，进行掩护。结果他却露了马脚，欲盖弥彰，弄巧成拙。事实是任何花言巧语所不能推翻的。当右倾机会主义者及国内外牛鬼蛇神掀起反共反华浪潮时，吴晗同志将《海瑞骂皇帝》放出笼了。当右倾机会主义者的阴谋诡计被人民识破，受人民唾骂时，吴晗同志又将《海瑞罢官》捧出场。好个古为今用！看，古的海瑞不正是用于今的右倾机会主义者吗？古的皇帝岂不正影射着今的党中央吗？这就是吴晗同志不可告人的企图。很显然，吴晗同志要今人“学古人好的品德”，就是要被罢了官的右倾机会主义者不怕“罢官”，不怕失败，失败了再干！我们的党是伟大、光荣、正确的，我们每个战士都决心象雷锋、王杰、麦贤得同志那样，一颗红心永向党，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，作毛主席的好战士，作红色接班人。吴晗同志的恶毒阴谋，我们必须给以坚决的反击。
