    New Zealand Communist Party Resolved to Fight American Imperialism and Soviet Revisionism to the End
    Soviet Communist Party Leadership Should Bear Major Responsibility for Indonesian Reactionary Anti-Communist Events
    (Xinhua News Agency, Auckland, 21st) News: New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary Wilcox, in the work report delivered on behalf of the National Committee at the New Zealand Communist Party's 21st National Congress held from the 8th to the 11th, strongly condemned the collusion between American imperialism and the Soviet modern revisionist group, jointly opposing China and undermining national liberation movements. He pointed out that the world's people's revolutionary forces and Marxist-Leninist forces are constantly growing stronger, while the forces of imperialism and modern revisionism are constantly weakening. The New Zealand Communist Party is determined to fight American-led imperialism and Soviet-led modern revisionism to the end.
    Wilcox first pointed out in his report: "Since our party's last congress in 1963, we have experienced a period of intense struggle to defend the principles of Marxism-Leninism, to continue to base our practical policies on these principles, so that we can conduct correct leadership in the great struggle against imperialism, led by the main enemy of all mankind today, American imperialism.
    "We have seen a series of major events that have confirmed that our party, standing on the ideological position of Marxism-Leninism, is correct. Today's situation requires our party to intensify its efforts to ensure a correct Marxist-Leninist understanding in theory and practice."
    He said, "As communists, we must stand at the forefront of the struggle to defend democracy.
    "We must make more and more people understand that the struggle to defend peace is first and foremost a struggle against American imperialism. We have a responsibility to strive in the coming period to mobilize more and more people into this struggle."
    He pointed out, "If the anti-imperialist struggle is to be fully unfolded on all fronts, if the struggle for national independence is to bear fruit, then we must continue to struggle against revisionism and sectarianism."
    Wilcox recounted the changes in the international situation in recent years. He pointed out: "Since our last congress, we have seen that American imperialism—the main enemy of the people—and British imperialism are both facing hopeless crises, which have become increasingly acute due to the economic and political victories of the socialist world—especially in Asia—and due to the victories of national liberation revolutions throughout the world."
    He said: "American imperialism is now rapidly expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam. Its false 'peace' demands, based on accepting the presence of American troops in Vietnam and other parts of Southeast Asia, based on 'peace through American rule of this region,' are merely a smokescreen to cover up its conspiracy to expand the conflict area. It knows that the people fighting for national liberation in this region will not accept it. Acceptance would mean the failure of everything the people have fought for so bravely and for so long—it would mean the victory of American imperialism, the enslavement of the people."
    Wilcox pointed out that the United States is preparing to further expand its aggression because it cannot defeat the will and determination of the Vietnamese people and the people of other regions of Southeast Asia, which is that they want to decide their own destiny in their own way, to govern themselves, to implement the social system they aspire to, and to get rid of American rule under the guise of "aid," "freedom," and "democracy."
    Wilcox said: "Haven't the 'peace figures' in Washington, about whom Khrushchev and other revisionists used to talk so warmly, exposed their true colors? They have proven with their actions that their peace rhetoric, their concern for freedom and democracy, is nothing more than a cloak to cover up their aggressive behavior, because their imperialist, predatory position is further threatened by the national liberation struggle and the progress of socialism. Those 'peace figures' talk about disarmament at meetings, but they continue to arm themselves and their puppets, using weapons on an increasingly large scale against national liberation movements, against those socialist countries that refuse to succumb to their blackmail threats, and against peace-loving people around the world."
    He said: "Today, imperialism has given Marxists-Leninists a useful lesson: now and in the past, there are no peaceful imperialists. Imperialism has weakened throughout the world, but its weakness has not brought peaceful actions, but increasingly frantic aggressive actions. The classic description of the nature of imperialism and the actions it will inevitably take remains as correct today as when Lenin so brilliantly elucidated this theory. Since the downfall of Khrushchev and other modern revisionist leaders, the new leaders of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union have refused to face this fact. An example of this is: they claim that as long as the United States launches an armed attack on Vietnam, it cannot be expected to improve US-Soviet relations, but at the Geneva Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Conference, the Soviet representative said that the Soviet Union 'does not want to make our discussions dependent on the Vietnam issue.'"
    The New Zealand Communist Party General Secretary said, "We should not be afraid of this development—we should anticipate this development and use this development, without evasion or compromise. The imperialists are doing this with complete despair. Inside their camp, difficulties are increasing. The most powerful of them, the United States, has undertaken obligations in vast areas, the scope of which is so broad that it is becoming increasingly difficult to hold onto these places. This is illustrated by the fact that the United States has transferred some of its forces from Europe to Asia. Unfortunately, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other revisionists have helped in this regard by adopting a 'soft' line on the Berlin and North Atlantic Treaty Organization issues."
    He pointed out that American imperialism, which possesses a powerful military machine, has proven to be a "paper tiger"—strong in appearance but weak in reality. The entire imperialist economy, based on the arms race, is breaking down under pressure. At the same time, contradictions within the imperialist camp are developing. France continues to play an independent role, in opposition to American imperialism. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization group, which was once a monolithic bloc, is no longer united. In the eyes of the United States, the situation of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is even worse.
    Wilcox pointed out that the New Zealand Communist Party faces two major tasks: to fully carry out the struggle against American-led imperialism and to continue the struggle against modern revisionism.
    He said: "To fully carry out the anti-imperialist struggle, the struggle against the policies implemented by American-led imperialism everywhere. This is the only way to implement at present the eighty-one parties' view on the importance of the struggle for peace. Remember that imperialism is acting this way today because the forces striving for progress—the anti-imperialist forces throughout the world—have made great progress. It is important to understand the great significance of this fact. It will shatter all revisionist illusions.
    "Imperialists, with the help of revisionists, are today launching a counter-offensive against the advance of socialism and national liberation revolutions throughout the world, but this is a counter-offensive launched from an increasingly weakened position. We must not allow the so-called argument that China has been isolated and certain events in Africa and Indonesia to blind us to the overall situation.
    "Simply put, what recent events have strengthened our position and weakened the position of imperialism throughout the world? Socialist China has made nuclear weapons, and the entire socialist camp and our movement have been strengthened during this period. China's making of nuclear weapons is very necessary because American imperialism is attempting to carry out nuclear blackmail; and the Soviet Union is obviously unwilling to defend the socialist camp and the people of the world from the pressure of American nuclear blackmail."
    Wilcox pointed out: "No matter how many gestures are made, how many rumors are spread, the country that has boasted for so many years that it possesses weapons that are not only more numerous but also superior to those of the United States has not yet transported (to Vietnam) a large amount of military equipment. On the contrary, we have heard rumors, instigated by someone, that China is obstructing the Soviet Union from transporting military aid. This slander is not believed by anyone."
    Wilcox said, "The second task that arises with the first task is to continue the struggle against revisionism—the main danger to our world movement and our party."
    He said that the importance of this task lies in: "If the ideas of the modern revisionists have any influence on our thinking or our actions, then, due to their non-Marxist assessment of the nature of the situation inside imperialism today, it will be impossible to carry out a full anti-imperialist struggle on all fronts. Today, their activities in New Zealand and elsewhere are obstructive. In this way, they are helping imperialism. If we have even a little bit of the taste of revisionism, we will never be able to maintain a firm attitude on the Vietnam issue. There will only be empty talk without action. We will be misled by the idea of negotiating with the United States when it wants to maintain its position of strength with its armed forces."
    Wilcox pointed out: "Furthermore, the United States is openly planning to expand the war to other parts of Southeast Asia, and possibly even to China. This requires us to be extremely vigilant against the traps of revisionist rhetoric. Taking action against American imperialism in every possible way, according to the specific circumstances in each locality, is a requirement for all communists. We must not be deceived by words."
    He continued: "This issue requires us to briefly consider the situation of our world Marxist-Leninist movement since our last national congress. During this period, many events of great value have occurred, many lessons have been learned, and some victories have been achieved in terms of Marxist-Leninist principles. However, on the whole, revisionism remains stubborn and remains the main danger.
      "The downfall of Khrushchev, the big boss of modern revisionism, was an event of great significance, but his ideas still prevail in the leadership of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and many other parties, and these ideas are expressed in a more cunning way. Despite many unscrupulous actions and interference by foreign revisionists, the conspiracy of revisionism to thwart or split those parties that adhere to the Marxist-Leninist stand has failed. This is the case with the New Zealand Communist Party, the Japanese Communist Party, and the Indonesian Communist Party."
    Wilcox also pointed out: "During the period since the end of the last national congress, the Marxist-Leninist forces in many countries have grown stronger, whether within the communist parties under revisionist leadership or through the establishment of Marxist-Leninist parties and groups. These parties and groups had to be established because some people were expelled from the old communist parties and because it became increasingly impossible to conduct activities in a Marxist way within them."
    He pointed out: "Our attitude against the preparatory committee meeting originally convened by Khrushchev has proven to be correct. The fact is that this kind of meeting is not in line with the provisions of the eighty-one parties' statement on how to handle the differences in our world movement. In its original form, the purpose of convening this meeting was to achieve a final split, to achieve the victory of modern revisionism, and to excommunicate true Marxist-Leninists."
    He pointed out that this split meeting "issued a demand for unity, a unity that is not based on Marxism-Leninism, not based on a principled discussion of differences, but essentially unity for the sake of unity. It disregards principles. Saying 'Let us unite now, because what separates us is much less than what we agree on' is a ridiculous cry. To accept this statement is to accept their revisionist ideas and the failures that they will bring. In other words, if this demand is followed, it will actually mean: 'Unite now, do it according to revisionist policies and theories, stop arguing, and let time solve the problem.'"
    "This appeal, if it is not downright idealism, is a sinister tactic to create divisions within the parties that adhere to Marxism-Leninism. This is not a genuine demand for principled unity. There cannot be and will not be genuine unity in our world movement until everyone agrees that there is a need to objectively and self-critically review everything that has happened since at least the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union."
    He said: "We must recognize today that not only in the socialist world, not only in the world of colonies or former colonies, but also in our world, in the imperialist world, the forces against imperialism, against its murderous ways, are also growing. In our world, despite the pacifist lines and activities of revisionists, the forces for peace are increasingly realizing that the struggle for peace will inevitably bring people into direct opposition to the policies of American-led imperialism. Under these objectively favorable conditions for our advance, Marxist-Leninists must not hesitate to launch the most violent attacks right now. On this issue, the demoralizing influence of modern revisionist ideas is also very obvious.
    "Of course, when we talk about the most violent attacks, we mean that it must depend on the local movement situation and level; but there is no reason not to take action. We must learn to react and take action quickly.
    "We will make some mistakes, but we must quickly learn from them. We must not have any illusions about the results of American imperialists dealing with the socialist world or any part of it. We cannot compromise on matters of principle."
    Wilcox said: "This does not mean that it is impossible now, or will be impossible in the future, to negotiate on a limited scope for limited goals, but, from a Marxist-Leninist point of view, it is fundamentally impossible to accept the current American concept of dividing the world by two great powers, one a capital-imperialist power and the other a socialist power.
    "The American position is very clear from Johnson's appeal to the Soviet Union on May 13, 1965. At that time, Johnson asked the Soviet Union to replace the war in Southeast Asia with economic aid, and urged the Soviet leaders to join the Asian Development Bank with the United States. Would any communist be so naive as to believe that this kind of aid is not for maintaining imperialism's current exploitation of the territory, defeating the national liberation movement, and trying to stop the expansion of socialist borders?"
    He cited the example of the Soviet leadership's aid to the Indian reactionaries, saying that this kind of aid supported imperialism on the one hand and opposed another socialist country—the only socialist country that imperialism is very afraid of today: People's China.
    Wilcox spoke about the issue of convening an international conference of communist parties, saying, "We believe that it should be postponed for a long period of time. If it is opened earlier, this kind of meeting will only bring more trouble and make our imperialist enemies happy."
    "We repeat that before any world conference, there must be a certain amount of time and appropriate patient preparation for long-term prior discussions; this necessity cannot be replaced by any sudden discussions or excessively hasty issuance of false demands for unity. Of course, if any meeting is to be held, all parties in the socialist world must agree to participate. This is our unwavering view."
    When talking about the open polemics between Marxist-Leninists and modern revisionists, Wilcox said, "The open arguments have reached such a stage that they are now helping our entire movement to return to the Marxist-Leninist position throughout the world. Therefore, we must reject any revisionist demands to immediately stop the arguments."
    Wilcox also talked about some theoretical issues debated by Marxist-Leninists and modern revisionists in his report. He said: "When our delegation went to Moscow to hold bilateral talks, Comrade Suslov made a fairly lengthy attack on our statement about the center of the world revolution. We said that the center of the world revolution today is in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The great significance of this point was not fully realized at the time, but now this point has become very clear, because we have learned that not only must we continue the struggle in these regions—the weak points of imperialism—but we must also aid this struggle in every possible way. This is not only a proletarian international obligation, but it is also the only way to put the issue of socialist revolution on the agenda in our countries in the imperialist world. To say, as the revisionists do, that this attitude reduces and underestimates the role of the working class in the major capitalist countries is pure nonsense."
    He said: "Lenin taught all Marxists that the chains of imperialism will be broken at the weakest link. That is to say, where the revolutionary movement is at a high tide and the internal contradictions of imperialism are the most acute. All assistance must be given to those who are breaking this weak link."
    He pointed out: "Russia under the Tsar was a weak link in the imperialist war. Europe was then the center of the world revolutionary movement. Today, that center has shifted, but the revisionists have ignored this fact. They say to the communists and revolutionary forces all over the world, including the communists and revolutionary forces in areas where the revolutionary opportunity has matured: 'You must wait, until you can attack the fortress of imperialism.' This means: 'You must accept the status quo indefinitely everywhere in the world.'
    "If we put this in the first place, it will create illusions of a peaceful transition to socialism everywhere. This is consistent with the attitude of waiting. While imperialism still exists, we are striving for a 'world without weapons, a world without war.' This is impossible. While colonialism still exists, while neo-colonialism is developing, are we going to put the issue of giving the fullest assistance to the center of the storm (those areas that are actually fighting with imperialism) in a secondary position? If we do this, we will certainly emphasize negotiations rather than struggle, and compromise rather than firmness.
    "Is this not the reason why some people are currently verbally expressing support for the struggles of the people of oppressed countries but are giving them insufficient assistance when they face the resolute opposition of American imperialism? Is this not the situation in Southeast Asia today?" He cited the example that in Indonesia, "before the September 30th Movement, the revisionists supported the old Trotskyite group, regarding it as 'true communists,' attempting to divide the Indonesian Communist Party in this way—it was and still is firmly standing on the basis of Marxism-Leninism. When the Indonesian Communist Party was initially facing the attack of the reactionaries, this sabotage must have weakened the position of the Indonesian Communist Party to some extent. The modern revisionists led by the Soviet Communist Party should bear major responsibility for this."
    He pointed out: "The modern revisionists are exaggerating the key role of the working class in the imperialist fortress, but if someone clearly says that to put the revolutionary development of these fortresses on the agenda, it is necessary to achieve further complete victories in the current storm center areas, they will call these people dogmatists, or worse. They have recently put forward a statement that those who hold the above view are not communists, but just 'land revolutionaries.' This is how they cover up their betrayal of Marxism-Leninism."
    Wilcox pointed out: "All this raises a question, which is what is the basic reason for the revisionists' degeneration to this point? They have allowed bourgeois ideology to develop within our movement, and today, they have revised Marxism in many ways, so they naturally cannot understand the essence of today's world contradictions.
    "Unless we recognize this fact in New Zealand, we will never have sufficient power in the struggle against international and domestic monopoly capital. In that case, no matter what we might say verbally, we will not only be abandoning those who are conducting a direct—often armed—struggle against imperialism, but as far as New Zealand's struggle for socialism is concerned, we will also be turning back the clock. They must defeat imperialism with our help before we can achieve victory at this stage. If we take any other view, then we will be intentionally or unintentionally betraying the workers on this issue, just as the Social Democratic leaders of the Second International did in the past, when they revised Marxism to suit their developing opportunistic claims—these claims were just a reflection of bourgeois ideas infiltrating their ranks."
    Wilcox emphasized in his report: "Our domestic revisionists and the open apologists for imperialism accuse us of 'standing on the side of China.' They say that the Soviet leaders have become 'moderate,' so they are no longer a major danger now, but the Chinese are still 'old-fashioned revolutionaries,' and, because we say that we agree with the Chinese Communist Party's revolutionary policies on this issue, we are 'standing on the side of China.' The truth is certainly not like this. This is not a question of standing on which side, but a question of ideology. We are standing on the side of Marxism-Leninism, and no lies or slanders can make us leave it.
    "We must remember that those who accuse us regard People's China as their main enemy. The imperialists hold this attitude, and we are increasingly finding that the modern revisionists also hold this attitude. However, who is the main enemy of mankind? Isn't it American imperialism? Hasn't American imperialism made it clear who their most powerful opponent is? Of course it has. They said it is People's China, they talked about 'containing China,' and even talked about conducting a nuclear war if necessary. American imperialism regards China as the biggest obstacle to their realization of world hegemony. The people who are attacked for standing on China's 'side' are actually the main enemies of American imperialism in their own countries. This is the reason why we, the New Zealand Communist Party, are being attacked in this way.
    "It has been stated here that the revisionists' attack on People's China is wrong. The American imperialists are attempting to cover up their own aggressive actions by propagating that China 'pursues a strong expansionist policy.' Who launched the war of aggression against Korea and is still relying on it today? It is the United States, not China. It is not China that put Japan under its control and turned that country into an American base, nor is it China that is carrying out military intervention in Laos. Who is using Thailand, the Philippines, etc. as military bases? Who sent more than 200,000 troops to Vietnam, and who is dropping bombs on northern Vietnam? It is not China, but the United States. The leaders of the United States say that China wants to 'completely dominate and control the areas adjacent to it,' but it is the Americans, not the Chinese, who have run to those places thousands of miles away from their own country's coasts—but the modern revisionists still want us to regard China as an enemy.
    "Today's People's China under the leadership of the Communist Party is the main fortress for the people of all countries in the world to fight against aggressive imperialism. This is the fact, and this is why we refuse to follow the revisionists in attacking China and thus help American imperialism.
    "The people of all countries in the world are uniting more and more widely to oppose American-led imperialism. In all the countries where imperialism still openly or through neo-colonialism maintains its rule, the people are fighting for their own national independence.
    "In New Zealand, the anti-imperialist and national independence struggle is developing in this way due to the recent increase in international monopoly capital companies operating in New Zealand and due to the situation in Vietnam. This movement will grow stronger. We must play a full role in encouraging a broad anti-movement to grow stronger and in encouraging people who are involved in this movement to recognize that, in the final analysis, the problem can only be solved by defeating monopoly capital domestically and internationally and moving towards a socialist New Zealand.
    "Today, the New Zealand Communist Party proudly holds high the banner of national independence, and it is the only party that is determined to fight for a bright socialist future."

### 威尔科克斯总书记在新共二十一大作全国委员会工作报告  新共决心为反对美帝和苏联修正主义斗争到底  苏共领导应当对印度尼西亚反动派的反共事件负重大责任

    威尔科克斯总书记在新共二十一大作全国委员会工作报告
    新共决心为反对美帝和苏联修正主义斗争到底
    苏共领导应当对印度尼西亚反动派的反共事件负重大责任
    新华社二十一日讯　奥克兰消息：新西兰共产党总书记威尔科克斯在八日到十一日举行的新共第二十一次全国代表大会上代表全国委员会作的工作报告中，强烈谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义集团互相勾结，联合反华和破坏民族解放运动。他指出，世界人民革命力量和马克思列宁主义力量正在不断壮大，帝国主义和现代修正主义力量在不断削弱，新西兰共产党决心为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导为首的现代修正主义而斗争到底。
    威尔科克斯在报告中首先指出：“自从一九六三年我们党上次代表大会以来，我们经历了一个为保卫马克思列宁主义原则，为继续把我们的实际政策置于这些原则的基础之上，以使我们能够在反对今天以全人类的主要敌人美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的伟大斗争中进行正确领导而激烈斗争的时期。
    “我们看到了一系列重大的事件，这些事件证实了，站在马克思列宁主义意识形态立场上的我们党是正确的。今天的形势要求我们党加紧努力以保证在理论和实践方面有正确的马克思列宁主义的认识。”
    他说，“作为共产党人，我们必须站在保卫民主的斗争最前列。
    “我们必须使越来越多的人民懂得，保卫和平的斗争首先是反对美帝国主义的斗争。我们有责任在今后一个时期中为把越来越多的人民动员到这个斗争中来而奋斗。”
    他指出，“如果要在各条战线上充分展开反帝斗争，如果要使争取民族独立的斗争产生成果，那末，我们就必须继续同修正主义和宗派主义进行斗争。”
    威尔科克斯追述了几年来国际局势的变化。他指出：“自从我们上次代表大会以来，我们看到美帝国主义——人民的主要敌人——和英帝国主义都面临着毫无希望的危机，这个危机由于社会主义世界——特别是在亚洲——在经济上和政治上取得的胜利以及由于世界范围内民族解放革命取得的胜利而变得日益尖锐。”
    他说：“美帝国主义现在正在迅速扩大侵略越南的战争。它的假‘和平’要求，是以接受美军留在越南和东南亚其他地区为基础的，是以‘让美国统治这个地区才有和平’为基础的，这只不过是掩盖它要扩大冲突地区的阴谋的一个烟幕。它知道，这个地区为争取民族解放而斗争的人民是不会接受的。如果接受，就意味着人民这么勇敢和这么长期为之斗争的一切都遭到失败——这将意味着美帝国主义的胜利，人民的被奴役。”
    威尔科克斯指出，美国正在准备进一步扩大侵略行动，因为它无法挫败越南人民和东南亚其他地区人民的意志和决心，那就是他们要以自己的方式决定自己命运，要自己管理自己，要实行自己向往的社会制度，要摆脱以“援助”、“自由”和“民主”为幌子的美国统治。
    威尔科克斯说：“赫鲁晓夫和其他修正主义分子过去那么亲热地谈到的华盛顿的‘和平人物’难道还没有暴露出他们的真面目么？他们以行动证明，他们的和平言论，他们对自由对民主的关心，不过是用来遮盖他们的侵略行为的外衣，因为他们的帝国主义的、掠夺的地位由于民族解放斗争和社会主义的进展而进一步受到威胁。那些‘和平人物’在会上谈裁军，但是却在继续武装他们自己和他们的傀儡，对民族解放运动，对拒绝向他们的讹诈威胁屈服的那些社会主义国家，越来越大规模地使用武器，并且对全世界爱好和平的各国人民使用武器。”
    他说：“今天，帝国主义给马克思列宁主义者上了一堂有益的课：现在和过去一样，并没有什么和平的帝国主义者。帝国主义在世界范围内已经削弱，但是它的虚弱并没有带来和平行动，而是带来越来越疯狂的侵略行动。对帝国主义本性及其必然采取的行动所作的经典说明，今天仍然同列宁如此英明地阐明这个理论的时候一样正确。自从赫鲁晓夫和其他现代修正主义领导人下台以来，苏联共产党的新领导拒绝面对这个事实。说明这点的一个例子是：他们声称只要美国对越南发动武装进攻，就不能指望改善美苏关系，但是在日内瓦十八国裁军会议上，苏联代表说，苏联‘不想使我们的讨论取决于越南问题’”。
    新共总书记说，“我们不应该害怕这种事态发展——我们应该预料到这种事态发展，并且利用这种事态发展，不要回避或者妥协。帝国主义者是怀着完全绝望的心情这样干的。在他们的阵营内部，困难日益增加。其中最强大的美国在辽阔的地区承担了义务，这个范围很广，以致于要保住这个地区的这些地方也越来越困难了。说明这一点的是，美国把一些兵力从欧洲调到了亚洲。不幸，苏共和其他修正主义者在柏林和北大西洋公约组织问题上采取‘软’的路线，在这方面帮了忙。”
    他指出，拥有着强大的军事机器的美帝国主义证明是一只“纸老虎”——外强中干。以军备竞赛为基础的整个帝国主义经济在压力之下正在破裂。同时，帝国主义阵营内的矛盾正在发展。法国继续起着独立的作用，与美帝国主义对立。曾经是铁板一块的北大西洋公约组织集团不再是团结一致的了。在美国看来，东南亚条约组织的情况更糟。
    威尔科克斯指出，新西兰共产党面临两项重大的任务：充分开展反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争和继续进行反对现代修正主义的斗争。
    他说：“充分开展反帝斗争，反对以美国为首的帝国主义在各地实行的政策的斗争。这是在目前贯彻八十一个党关于争取和平的斗争的重要性的观点的唯一道路。要记住，帝国主义今天所以这样活动是因为争取进步的力量——全世界反帝力量取得了巨大的进展。了解这一事实的重大意义，是很重要的。它会打破一切修正主义幻想。
    “帝国主义者在修正主义者的帮助下，今天正在世界范围内对社会主义和民族解放革命的前进进行反攻，但这是从日益虚弱的地位出发进行的一种反攻。我们决不能让所谓中国已经孤立的论调以及非洲和印度尼西亚的某些事件，使我们看不到全局。
    “简单地说，最近在世界范围内发生了哪些加强我们地位，削弱帝国主义地位的事呢？社会主义中国制成了核弹，整个社会主义阵营和我们的运动在这个时期得到了加强。中国制造核弹是非常必要的，因为美帝国主义企图进行核讹诈；而苏联显然不愿意保卫社会主义阵营和世界人民，使之不受美国核讹诈的压力。”
    威尔科克斯指出：“不论作出了多少姿态，散布了多少谣言，那个多年来自吹拥有的武器不仅比美国多而且比美国优越的国家至今也还没有（向越南）运出大量的军事装备。相反，我们却听到了有人授意散布的谣言说中国在阻挠苏联运出军事援助。这种诽谤根本无人相信。”
    威尔科克斯说，“随着第一个任务产生的第二个任务是继续进行反对修正主义——我们的世界运动和我们党的主要危险——的斗争。”
    他说，这个任务的重要性在于：“如果现代修正主义者的思想对我们的思想或我们的行动产生什么影响的话，那么，由于他们对今天帝国主义内部情况的性质作了非马克思主义的估计，就不可能在一切战线上开展充分的反对帝国主义的斗争。今天他们在新西兰和其他地方的活动都是起阻挠作用的。这样，他们便是在帮助帝国主义。我们只要有一点修正主义的味道，便决不能在越南问题上保持坚定的态度。就只会说空话而不会有行动。我们就会被那种要在美国保持它的武装部队的实力地位的时候，同美国搞谈判的思想所迷惑。”
    威尔科克斯指出：“更进一步来说，美国公然在策划把战争扩大到东南亚其他地方去，甚至可能扩大到中国，这要求我们对修正主义口头上的圈套保持极大的警惕。按照各地的具体情况，用一切可能的方式对美帝国主义采取行动是对一切共产党人的要求。我们决不可被言词所迷惑。”
    他接着说：“这个问题要使我们概略地考虑一下，我们上次全国代表大会以来我们的世界马克思列宁主义运动的形势。这期间发生了许多具有重大价值的事件，汲取了许多经验教训，在马克思列宁主义原则方面取得了一些胜利，但是，总的说来，修正主义仍然是顽强的，仍然是主要的危险。
      “现代修正主义的大头目赫鲁晓夫的下台是一桩意义重大的事件，但是他的思想仍然在苏联共产党和其他许多党的领导中占上风，而且这种思想以更加狡猾的方式表现出来。尽管外国修正主义者采取许多肆无忌惮的行动和干涉，但是，修正主义企图挫败或者分裂那些坚持马克思列宁主义立场的政党的阴谋遭到了失败。在新西兰党是如此，在日本党和印度尼西亚党也是如此。”
    威尔科克斯还指出：“在上次全国代表大会结束以来的这段期间里，许多国家的马克思列宁主义力量壮大了，不论是在修正主义领导下的共产党内，还是通过成立马克思列宁主义政党和小组。这些政党和小组是由于有些人被老共产党开除和由于越来越不可能在它们里面以马克思主义的方式进行活动而不得不成立的。”
    他指出：“我们反对原先由赫鲁晓夫召开的筹备委员会会议的态度被证明是正确的。事实是，这种会议是不符合八十一党声明关于如何处理我们的世界运动中的分歧的规定的。按它原先的形式来说，开这个会议是要实现最后分裂，使现代修正主义获得胜利和把真正的马克思列宁主义者革出教门。”
    他指出，这次分裂会议“发出一项团结的要求，不是以在马克思列宁主义为基础、不是以对分歧的有原则的讨论为基础的团结，而是基本上是为了团结而团结。它无视了原则。说什么
  ‘让我们现在团结吧，因为把我们分开的东西要比我们意见一致的东西少得多’，这是荒谬的叫嚷。接受这种说法就是接受他们的修正主义思想和它将带来的失败。换句话说，如果照这项要求来办，它实际上将意味着：‘现在团结吧，按照修正主义的政策和理论来做吧，停止争论吧，让时间解决问题吧。’”
    “这个呼吁如果不是不折不扣的唯心主义，就是企图在坚持马克思列宁主义的各党内制造分歧的阴险手法。这不是真正要求有原则的团结。在大家都同意需要客观地、以自我批评的精神来检讨至少是从苏共二十大之时起所发生的一切事情以前，我们的世界运动中不能有而且也不会有真正的团结。”
    他说：“我们今天必须认识到，不仅在社会主义世界中，不仅在殖民地或前殖民地的世界中，而且在我们这个世界中，在帝国主义的世界中，反对帝国主义、反对它的杀人方式的力量也在日益增长。在我们的世界中，尽管有修正主义者的和平主义的路线和活动，和平的力量在越来越认识到争取和平的斗争不可避免地会使人们直接反对以美国为首的帝国主义的政策。在这种客观上有利于我们前进的情况下，马克思列宁主义者必须就在现在毫不犹豫地进行最猛烈不过的打击。在这个问题上，现代修正主义思想的削弱斗志的影响也是很明显的。
    “当然，当我们谈到最猛烈不过的打击的时候，我们的意思是说要取决于当地的运动形势和水平；但是不采取行动是没有理由的。我们必须学会迅速作出反应和采取行动。
    “我们会犯一些错误，但是我们必须迅速从中汲取教训。我们决不能对美帝国主义者同社会主义世界或它的任何一部分之间打交道的结果抱任何幻想。我们不能在原则问题上妥协。”
    威尔科克斯说：“这并不是说，现在不能，或者将来不能在有限的范围内就有限的目标进行谈判，但是，从马克思列宁主义的观点出发，接受美国目前关于由两个大国，一个是资本—帝国主义大国，另一个是社会主义大国，瓜分世界的概念进行谈判，那是根本办不到的。
    “从约翰逊一九六五年五月十三日向苏联发出的呼吁就可以很清楚地看出美国的立场。当时，约翰逊要求苏联用经济援助代替东南亚战争，并且敦促苏联领导人同美国一起参加亚洲开发银行。难道有任何共产党人会那么天真而相信这种援助不是为了保持帝国主义现在的剥削地盘、击败民族解放运动和设法阻止社会主义疆界的扩大吗？”
    他举苏联领导援助印度反动派的例子说，这种援助一方面支持了帝国主义，另一方面反对了另一个社会主义国家——帝国主义今天非常害怕的唯一的一个社会主义国家：人民中国。
    威尔科克斯谈到关于召开共产党国际会议的问题时说，“我们认为应该推迟很长一个时期。如果早开了，这种会议只会带来更多的麻烦，会使我们的帝国主义敌人高兴。”
    “我们重复一下，在任何世界会议之前必须经过一定时间和为长期的事先讨论进行适当的耐心准备；这一必要性是不能为任何突然的讨论、过分匆忙地发出团结的假要求的作法所代替的。当然，如果要举行任何会议，必须是社会主义世界的所有政党都同意参加。这是我们的坚定不移的看法。”
    在谈到马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义者的公开论战时，威尔科克斯说，“公开争论已达到这样的阶段，它们现在正有助于我们的整个运动在全世界范围内回到马克思列宁主义的立场上去。因此，我们必须拒绝关于立即停止争论的任何修正主义的要求。”
    威尔科克斯在报告中还谈到马克思列宁主义者同现代修正主义者争论的一些理论问题。他说：“当我们的代表团到莫斯科去举行双边会谈的时候，苏斯洛夫同志对我们关于世界革命风暴中心的声明进行相当冗长的攻击。我们说，世界革命风暴中心今天是在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲。当时人们没有充分认识到这一点的重大意义，但是现在这一点已变得很清楚了，因为我们了解到不仅必须使这些地区——帝国主义的薄弱地点——的斗争继续下去，而且还必须以一切可能的办法来援助这种斗争。这不仅是一个无产阶级的国际义务，而且也是在我们这些帝国主义世界的国家中把社会主义革命问题提到日程上来的唯一办法。象修正主义者那样说什么这种态度缩小和低估了各主要资本主义国家工人阶级的作用，那纯粹是胡说。”
    他说：“列宁教导一切马克思主义者说，帝国主义的锁链将在最薄弱的环节突破。就是说在革命运动处于高潮和帝国主义内部矛盾最尖锐的地方。对于那些正在突破这个薄弱环节的人，必须给以一切援助。”
    他指出：“沙皇统治下的俄国是帝国主义战争中的一个薄弱环节。欧洲当时是世界革命运动的中心。今天，这个中心转移了，但是修正主义者无视了这个事实。他们向全世界的共产党人和革命力量、包括革命时机已经成熟的地区的共产党人和革命力量说：‘你们必须等待，一直到你们能攻击帝国主义的堡垒’。这意味着：‘你们必须在世界一切地方无限期地接受现状。’
    “如果我们把这放在首要的地位，就会在各地造成向社会主义和平过渡的幻想。这是和等待的态度一致的。在帝国主义仍然存在的时候，我们却在争取一个‘没有武器的世界，一个没有战争的世界’。这是不可能的。在殖民主义还存在的时候，在新殖民主义在发展的时候，难道我们要把给予风暴中心（那些同帝国主义实际进行战斗的地区）以最充分援助的问题摆在次要地位吗？如果我们这样做，当然会强调谈判而不是斗争、强调妥协而不是坚定。
    “目前有人在口头上表示支持被压迫国家人民的斗争而在他们面对美帝国主义的坚决反对时却对他们的援助不力，其原因不就在此吗？这难道不是东南亚今天的情况吗？”他举例说，在印度尼西亚，“在九月三十日事件之前，修正主义者曾支持老的托洛茨基集团，把它作为‘真正的共产主义者’，企图这样来分化印度尼西亚共产党——它过去是、现在仍然是坚定地站在马克思列宁主义的基础之上的。在印度尼西亚共产党在初期面临反动派的进攻的时候，这种破坏必定在某种程度上削弱了印度尼西亚共产党的地位。以苏共领导为首的现代修正主义应当对此负重大责任。”
    他指出：“现代修正主义者夸夸其谈地大谈在帝国主义堡垒内工人阶级的关键作用，但是如果有人明确地说，要把这些堡垒内的革命发展提到日程上来，就必须在今天的风暴中心地区取得进一步的彻底胜利，他们就把这些人称为教条主义者，或者说得更坏。他们最近提出了一种说法，说那些持上述看法的人不是共产党，而只是‘土地革命者’。他们就是这样来掩盖他们对马克思列宁主义的背叛。”
    威尔科克斯指出：“所有这一切提出了一个问题，这就是修正主义堕落到这种地步的基本原因是什么？他们听任资产阶级意识形态在我们的运动内发展，而今天，他们又在多方面修正了马克思主义，因此他们自然而然地无法了解今天的世界矛盾的本质。
    “除非我们在新西兰认识到这个事实，否则我们在反对国际和国内垄断资本的斗争中是决不会有充分的威力的。那样一来，不管我们口头上可能说些什么，我们将不仅是背弃了那些对帝国主义进行直接的——常常是武装的——斗争的人，而且就新西兰的争取社会主义的斗争来说，我们还会把时钟拨慢。必须使他们在我们的帮助下战胜帝国主义，我们才能在现阶段取得胜利。如果我们采取任何其他看法，那么我们就会在这个问题上有意或无意地背叛工人，就和第二国际的社会民主党领导人在以前所做的一样，当时他们修正了马克思主义来适合他们正在发展的机会主义的主张——这些主张只不过是资产阶级思想侵入他们的队伍中去的一个反映。”
    威尔科克斯在报告中强调指出：“我们本国的修正主义者和帝国主义的公开辩护士指责我们‘站在中国一边’。他们说，苏联领导人已经变得‘温和’了，因此现在不成其为一个大的危险了，但是中国人仍然是‘老派的革命派’，而且，由于我们说我们在这个问题上同意中国共产党的革命政策，所以我们是‘站在中国一边’。事情的真象当然并不是这样。这不是一个站在哪一边的问题，而是一个意识形态的问题。我们是站在马克思列宁主义一边，不论谎言或者诽谤都不能使我们离开它。
    “我们要记住，那些指责我们的人把人民中国看作他们的主要敌人。帝国主义者抱这种态度，我们越来越发现，现代修正主义者也抱这种态度。然而谁是人类的主要敌人呢？难道不是美帝国主义吗？美帝国主义不是明确说过了谁是他们的最强大的敌手吗？当然说过。他们说那就是人民中国，他们谈到要‘遏制中国’，甚至谈到如有必要就进行核战争。美帝国主义把中国看作他们实现世界霸权的最大障碍。被攻击为站在中国‘一边’的人，实际上是他们本国内的美帝国主义的主要敌人。我们新西兰共产党所以受到这样的攻击，原因就在这里。
    “这里已经说明了修正主义者攻击人民中国是错误的。美帝国主义者企图通过宣扬中国‘奉行强烈的扩张主义政策’来掩盖他们自己的侵略行动。是谁发动了侵朝战争而且今天还赖在那里呢？是美国，不是中国。把日本放在自己的控制之下并且把那个国家变成美国基地的不是中国，对老挝进行军事干涉的也不是中国。是谁利用泰国、菲律宾等等做军事基地呢？是谁派了二十多万军队到越南，是谁往越南北方扔炸弹呢？不是中国，而是美国。美国的领袖们说，中国想要‘完完全全地统治和控制与它毗邻的地区’，但是，跑到那些离自己本国的海岸几千英里的地方去的是美国人，而不是中国人——可是现代修正主义者还是要我们把中国看作敌人。
    “在共产党领导下的今天的人民中国是世界各国人民对侵略性的帝国主义作斗争的主要堡垒。这是事实，这就是我们拒绝跟着修正主义攻击中国从而为美帝国主义帮忙的原因所在。
    “世界各国人民正在越来越广泛地团结起来反对以美国为首的帝国主义。在凡是帝国主义仍然公开地或者通过新殖民主义方式保持他们的统治的国家中，人民都在为自己的民族独立而斗争。
    “在新西兰，反帝和争取民族独立的斗争这样发展，是由于在新西兰经营的国际垄断资本公司近来有了增加，是由于越南的局势。这个运动将会壮大起来。我们必须发挥充分的作用来鼓励广泛的反对运动壮大起来，鼓励投入这个运动的人们认识到，归根到底，只有在国内和国际上打败垄断资本，朝着社会主义的新西兰前进，问题才能够得到解决。
    “今天，新西兰共产党自豪地高举着民族独立的旗帜，它是唯一坚决为光辉的社会主义前途而奋斗的党。”
