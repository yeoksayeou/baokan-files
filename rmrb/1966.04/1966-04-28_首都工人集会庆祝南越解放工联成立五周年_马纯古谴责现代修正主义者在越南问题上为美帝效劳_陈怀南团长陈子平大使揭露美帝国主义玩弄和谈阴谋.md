    Capital Workers' Rally Celebrates the Fifth Anniversary of the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions
    Ma Chun-ku Condemns Modern Revisionists for Serving U.S. Imperialism on the Vietnam Issue
    Delegation Leader Chen Huai-nan and Ambassador Chen Zi-ping Expose U.S. Imperialism's Conspiracy to Play with Peace Talks
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 27) A rally of more than 1,500 workers in the capital was held this afternoon to celebrate the fifth anniversary of the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions.
    Liu Ning-yi, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, attended the meeting.
    The delegation of the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions led by Chen Huai-nan, Standing Committee Member of the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions, Nguyen Minh Phuong, Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to China, and Chen Zi-ping, Vietnamese Ambassador to China, were invited to attend the meeting.
    Ma Chun-ku, Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, spoke at the meeting. Ma Chun-ku said that under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions has actively organized and educated all workers and staff, making significant contributions to the great cause of defeating the American aggressors and realizing the unification of the motherland. The Chinese people warmly hail the great victory of the South Vietnamese people and extend their warmest congratulations to them. He said that the victory of the South Vietnamese people is a great victory of people's war.
    Referring to the peace swindle played by U.S. imperialism, Ma Chun-ku said that the "face-to-face talks" advocated by U.S. imperialism are a trick of counter-revolutionary dual tactics, and it is only a conspiracy to cover up the expansion of its war of aggression.
    Ma Chun-ku condemned the modern revisionists for serving U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, saying that only by carrying the struggle against modern revisionism centered on the leading group of the CPSU to the end can the struggle against U.S. imperialism be carried out victoriously.
    Ma Chun-ku expressed that the workers and people of China and Vietnam are close comrades-in-arms who share life and death. No matter what storms we encounter, and no matter how much sacrifice is required, the Chinese workers and people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will always stand with the Vietnamese workers and people and resolutely fight to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors.
    Delegation leader Chen Huai-nan said at the meeting that today's memorial meeting once again demonstrates the unbreakable fighting unity of the Chinese and Vietnamese workers and people against U.S. imperialism.
    Chen Huai-nan said that in the past five years, the workers in South Vietnam, under the organization and guidance of the South Vietnam Liberation Federation of Trade Unions, have continuously dealt blows to U.S. imperialism. Workers in the enemy-occupied areas of the South have adopted rich forms of struggle, and the armed and semi-armed forces of workers and working people have attacked the enemy everywhere.
    Chen Huai-nan exposed that while U.S. imperialism blatantly uses the most vile and barbaric means to massacre the people of South Vietnam, it shamelessly continues to spread "peace deception" rhetoric to cover up its crazy and adventurous policy of expanding aggression. He said that there is no way to save U.S. imperialism from its shameful and complete defeat. He said that no matter what the circumstances, there is always a brother standing by their side who sincerely helps them in all aspects, and that is the great Chinese working class and people.
    Ambassador Chen Zi-ping spoke of the brilliant victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.
    Ambassador Chen Zi-ping exposed the "peace" conspiracy played by U.S. imperialism. He said that the Vietnamese people will never be fooled by U.S. imperialism, nor will they allow U.S. imperialism to win at the conference table what it cannot win on the battlefield.

    首都工人集会庆祝南越解放工联成立五周年
    马纯古谴责现代修正主义者在越南问题上为美帝效劳
    陈怀南团长陈子平大使揭露美帝国主义玩弄和谈阴谋
    据新华社二十七日讯　首都工人一千五百多人今天下午举行集会，庆祝越南南方解放工会联合会成立五周年。
    全国总工会主席刘宁一出席了大会。
    越南南方解放工会联合会常务委员陈怀南率领的越南南方解放工会联合会代表团，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团副团长阮明芳，越南驻中国大使陈子平应邀出席了大会。
    全国总工会副主席马纯古在大会上讲话。马纯古说，越南南方解放工会联合会在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，积极组织和教育全体职工，为打败美国侵略者、实现祖国统一的伟大事业，作出了重大的贡献。中国人民热烈欢呼越南南方人民的伟大胜利，向他们表示最热烈的祝贺。他说，越南南方人民的胜利，是人民战争的伟大胜利。
    马纯古谈到美帝国主义玩弄的和平骗局时说，美帝国主义鼓吹的“面对面会谈”，是反革命两手的花招，它只不过是掩盖扩大侵略战争的阴谋。
    马纯古谴责了现代修正主义者在越南问题上为美帝国主义效劳，他说，只有把反对以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争进行到底，才能胜利地进行反对美帝国主义的斗争。
    马纯古表示，中越两国工人和人民是生死与共的亲密战友。不管遇到什么惊涛骇浪，也不管需要付出多大的代价，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人和人民，将永远同越南工人和人民站在一起，为彻底打败美国侵略者而坚决斗争。
    陈怀南团长在大会上说，今天举行的这个纪念会，再一次表明了中国和越南工人和人民之间牢不可破的反对美帝国主义的战斗团结。
    陈怀南说，五年来，越南南方的工人在越南南方解放工会联合会的组织和指导下，连续给美帝以不断的打击。南方敌占区工人采取了丰富的斗争形式，工人和劳动人民的武装和半武装力量到处袭击敌人。
    陈怀南揭露美帝国主义一方面明目张胆地使用最恶劣、最野蛮的手段残杀越南南方人民，另一方面又厚颜无耻地不断散布“和平欺骗”的论调，掩盖他们疯狂冒险的扩大侵略政策。他说，没有任何办法可以挽救美帝国主义可耻的彻底失败。他说，不论在什么情况下，经常有一个始终不渝地站在他们身边、真心诚意地在各方面帮助他们的兄弟，这就是伟大的中国工人阶级和人民。
    陈子平大使在讲话中谈到了越南人民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的辉煌胜利。
    陈子平大使揭露了美帝国主义所玩弄的“和平”阴谋。他说，越南人民决不上美帝国主义的当，也决不允许美帝国主义在会议桌上赢得它在战场上所不能赢得的东西。
