    Reactionary "Backbone"
                Zheng Tiegang
    In his "On Backbone," Wu Han talks extensively about the "backbone," "great men," and "heroic spirit" of the exploiting classes, encouraging right-leaning opportunists to be "great men," cultivate a "heroic spirit," and "not be subdued by force." He also instructs them to have the "backbone" to resist the people to the end, to "hold correct and firm views, consistently and courageously serve the progressive cause of the time, and withstand any difficulties, remaining unyielding and unbreakable, able to withstand storms and not be intimidated, persisting in struggle." He further tells the right-leaning opportunists: "Every era has many people with backbone, and we are the descendants of these people with backbone," urging the right-leaning opportunists to become contemporary people with "backbone."
    What exactly is the "backbone" that Wu Han talks about so much? In "On Backbone," he also vaguely says: "Different societies have different meanings of backbone, with different class essences." However, when discussing specific issues, he fundamentally does not use the method of class analysis to discuss backbone, but rather equates the backbone of the proletariat with that of the bourgeoisie and reactionaries, regardless of class. We say that the proletariat has the backbone of the proletariat, and the bourgeoisie has the "backbone" of the bourgeoisie. The "backbone" of the bourgeoisie and all reactionaries is to resolutely be enemies of the people, stubbornly following their old reactionary road to the end. This is completely different from our proletariat's backbone of not fearing hardship or death and wholeheartedly serving the revolution. However, in 1961, Wu Han sang praises for the right-leaning opportunists, praising and supporting the "backbone" of the right-leaning opportunists in opposing the Party, the people, and socialism. When the right-leaning opportunists were distraught in the face of the truth of Marxism and the revolutionary power of the people of the whole country, when the right-leaning opportunists encountered "difficulties," Wu Han pointed out to the right-leaning opportunists that they must be "unyielding and unbreakable," that they must "withstand, not be intimidated, and persist in struggle," even if they "go through all kinds of hardships and difficulties, failing and trying again."
    We say that the right-leaning opportunists at that time encountered "difficulties," that is, their plot to restore capitalism was opposed by the people of the whole country, they encountered the "difficulties" of the people of the whole country wanting socialism and the Three Red Banners, and they encountered the "difficulties" of not being able to reverse history. To still insist on having "backbone" in the face of such "difficulties" is to consciously be enemies of the people to the end, and to be determined to go to see God with a granite head.
    Wu Han also advocated a spirit of "resistance" and "resisting oppression." We all know that under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of our country defeated the Kuomintang reactionaries headed by Chiang Kai-shek, overthrew the three great mountains weighing on the people's heads, and established a new China, which is building socialism. This has fundamentally changed the exploited and oppressed status of the people of our country. We practice the people's democratic dictatorship, and apart from exercising dictatorship over class enemies, there is only a division of labor between the upper and lower levels of the country, and there is no question of who oppresses whom. The "resistance" and "resisting oppression" advocated by Wu Han, apart from slandering socialism, is a deliberate instigation and deception of the masses, and an encouragement to the right-leaning opportunists to oppose the Party, the people, and socialism. There is no room for Wu Han to quibble about this.
    From the article "On Backbone," it can be seen that Wu Han fully supports the right-leaning opportunists in frantically attacking the Party and socialism. This is something that Wu Han cannot cover up no matter how he tries to quibble. Wu Han racked his brains to encourage the right-leaning opportunists, to sing a duet with the Party, socialism, and the people of the whole country, and to slander the great Party and the Three Red Banners. This fully exposes Wu Han's reactionary political stance of opposing the Party, the people, and socialism.
    Wu Han's efforts to encourage the right-leaning opportunists can only be in vain, and cannot save the disastrous fate of the right-leaning opportunists in the slightest. Wu Han can only lament that the right-leaning opportunists he supported have too little "backbone." This really disappoints Wu Han greatly. It is just as Chairman Mao said: "So many deeds cry out to be done, and always urgently. The world rolls on, Time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, Seize the day, seize the hour! The Four Seas are rising, clouds and waters raging, The Five Continents are rocking, wind and thunder roaring. Our force is irresistible, Away with all pests!"
  (Mao Zedong's poem "Man Jiang Hong") History has fully proved this point. Failure is the destined fate of the right-leaning opportunists and Wu Han, because history cannot be reversed by a small group of right-leaning opportunists and their anti-Party and anti-socialist partners. History will advance victoriously towards socialism and communism according to its own laws of development.

### 反动的“骨气”

    反动的“骨气”
                郑铁纲
    吴晗在他的《谈骨气》中大谈特谈剥削阶级的“骨气”、“大丈夫”、“英雄气概”等等，鼓励右倾机会主义分子要做“大丈夫”、树“英雄气概”，要“威武不能屈”，并且指点他们要有与人民顽抗到底的“骨气”，要“抱有正确、坚定的主张，始终如一地勇敢地为当时的进步事业服务，遭遇任何困难，都压不扁、折不弯，碰上狂风巨浪，能够顶得住，吓不倒，坚持斗争”。他还进一步对右倾机会主义分子说：“每个时代都有很多这样有骨气的人，我们就是这些有骨气人的子孙”，要右倾机会主义分子成为当代有“骨气”的人。
    吴晗所大谈特谈的“骨气”究竟是一种什么东西呢？他在《谈骨气》中也泛泛地谈过：“社会不同，骨气的含义也是不同的，有着阶级本质的区别”。但是在谈论具体问题时，他根本没有用阶级分析的方法来谈骨气，而是不分阶级地把无产阶级的骨气和资产阶级、反动派的骨气同一起来。我们说，无产阶级有无产阶级的骨气，资产阶级有资产阶级的“骨气”。资产阶级和一切反动派的
  “骨气”是坚决与人民为敌，顽固地走他们的反动到底的老路。这是和我们无产阶级不怕苦，不怕死，一心为革命的骨气是截然不同的。而吴晗在一九六一年却为右倾机会主义分子唱赞歌，歌颂和支持右倾机会主义分子反党反人民反社会主义的“骨气”。当右倾机会主义分子在马克思主义的真理面前，在全国人民的革命威力面前，失魂落魄的时候，右倾机会主义分子遇到了“困难”，吴晗向右倾机会主义分子指出，要“压不扁、折不弯”，要“顶得住，吓不倒，坚持斗争”，那怕“历尽艰难困苦，失败了再干”。
    我们说，当时右倾机会主义分子是遇到了“困难”，那就是他们企图使资本主义复辟的阴谋遭到了全国人民的反对，他们遇到了全国人民要社会主义、要三面红旗的“困难”，遇到了不能使历史倒转的“困难”。在这样的“困难”面前还强要有“骨气”，这就是自觉地与人民为敌到底，就是决心带着花岗岩的脑袋去见上帝。
    吴晗还鼓吹一种“反抗”、“抗拒压迫”的精神。我们都知道，我国人民在党的正确领导下，打败了以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派，推翻了压在人民头上的三座大山，建立了新中国，正在建设社会主义，这就根本地改变了我国人民受剥削、受压迫的地位。我们实行了人民民主专政，除了对阶级敌人实行专政以外，举国上下只有分工的不同而没有谁压迫谁的问题。吴晗所鼓吹的“反抗”和“抗拒压迫”，除了对社会主义进行污蔑以外，则是别有用心的煽动和迷惑群众，鼓动右倾机会主义分子反党反人民反社会主义，除此之外是再也没有吴晗狡辩的余地了。
    从《谈骨气》这篇文章来看，吴晗全力支持右倾机会主义分子向党向社会主义猖狂地进攻，这是吴晗无论怎样狡辩都不能掩盖的。吴晗挖尽心思为右倾机会主义分子鼓劲打气，和党和社会主义和全国人民唱对台戏，污蔑伟大的党和三面红旗，这就充分地暴露了吴晗反党反人民反社会主义的反动政治立场。
    吴晗极力为右倾机会主义分子鼓劲打气，只能是枉费心机，丝毫挽救不了右倾机会主义分子惨败的命运。吴晗只能叹息他所支持的右倾机会主义分子太没有“骨气”罢了。这真是使吴晗大失所望。正象毛主席说的：“小小寰球，有几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣。蚂蚁缘槐夸大国，蚍蜉撼树谈何易。”“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”
  （毛主席诗词《满江红》）历史已充分地证明了这一点，失败是右倾机会主义分子和吴晗注定的命运，因为历史不是一小撮右倾机会主义分子及其反党反社会主义的伙伴们所能扭转的，历史将按着自己的发展规律朝着社会主义、共产主义胜利前进。
