    Xinhua News Agency, Dacca, April 14th (via dispatch) - The citizens of Dacca, the capital of East Pakistan, are enthusiastically preparing to warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi's friendly visit to East Pakistan.
    Large welcoming arches, colorful and vibrant, have been erected on the streets. The national flags of Pakistan and China, along with red and green banners, are hung along both sides of the streets. Public and private buildings are decorated with colorful lights, giving the city a festive atmosphere at night.
    Some slogans appearing in the city are written in Bengali: "China is our friend, the friend of the oppressed people, the upholder of justice," "Long live People's China."
    The All Pakistan Workers Union has established a twenty-member reception committee to give Chairman Liu Shaoqi a warm welcome upon his arrival. This committee is composed of representatives from various trade union organizations in Dacca city and its suburbs.
    Many people have come to Dacca from the northern towns of East Pakistan. The railway administration has allocated special trains to transport those eager to participate in welcoming Chairman Liu Shaoqi from Comilla, Mymensingh, and other counties near Dacca to Dacca. The city's telecommunications bureau has made special arrangements for transmitting facsimile images and placing long-distance calls during Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit. The postal department has also made special arrangements for delivering mail.
    Dacca's newspapers are working hard to prepare special supplements to be published on the day of the Chinese guests' arrival, introducing China's achievements in economic and cultural construction.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dacca, April 14th (via dispatch) - Public leaders and people from all walks of life in East Pakistan warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi's friendly visit to East Pakistan after concluding his visit to West Pakistan.
    Prominent public leader Abdul Hamid Khan Bhashani called on the citizens of Dacca at a rally to extend a warm welcome to the leader of the Chinese people. He said that the Chinese people firmly stood with Pakistan when India, colluding with imperialist countries, launched a war of aggression against Pakistan. At that time, Pakistan's so-called friends used every means to help and encourage Indian aggression. He said that this should make the Pakistani people realize who their true and sincere friends are.
    Bhashani also warmly praised China for consistently supporting the cause of oppressed peoples in Asia and Africa, pursuing a peaceful foreign policy, and being a source of inspiration for people all over the world who are struggling for liberation. He said, "The head of our great friendly neighbor is about to visit East Pakistan, and he should be given a reception worthy of him."
    According to the Pakistan Times, Bhashani also said in a conversation on the 7th that the friendship between Pakistan and China is definitely a lasting friendship because it is the culmination of the sincere aspirations of more than 800 million people in the two countries.
    At a meeting held in Dacca on April 8th, the East Pakistan Provincial Working Committee of the National People's Party passed a resolution stating that the Chinese government and people provided moral and material support to Pakistan during its difficult times. The people of East Pakistan should receive this leader from a great friendly country in accordance with the best traditions of the country, thereby strengthening the cause of Sino-Pakistani friendship and Afro-Asian solidarity.
    Nazir, the Deputy Commissioner of Dacca, also delivered a speech, calling on people from all walks of life to warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
    Hai, Chairman of the All Pakistan Labor Federation, and Shah Abdul Halim, General Secretary, spoke to the press on the 13th, calling on the workers of East Pakistan to give the leader of the great Chinese people the warmest welcome.
    The leaders of the Central Student Union of the East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology issued a statement saying that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit is "a great honor for Pakistan."
    A statement calling on people to warmly welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: China supported Pakistan when Pakistan suffered treacherous aggression last September. The visit of the Chinese leader "gives us a rare opportunity to open our hearts and express our gratitude." The statement said: "This welcome can show our patriotism, show a great nation's gratitude to a great country, and express our irreconcilable hatred of imperialist conspiracies."
    In recent days, East Pakistani newspapers have successively published editorials welcoming Chairman Liu Shaoqi's upcoming friendly visit to East Pakistan.
    The Pakistan Daily said in an editorial: "Sino-Pakistani friendship is not only necessary for mutual benefit, but also for maintaining world peace. In the recent national crisis (referring to India's aggression against Pakistan last September), the depth and sincerity of this friendship have been proven." It also said: "Some people are unhappy with this growing strength of Sino-Pakistani friendship. But despite this, we are confident that it will be further developed."
    The Freedom Daily's editorial warmly praised Chairman Liu Shaoqi's remarks on Sino-Pakistani friendship during his visit to West Pakistan. The editorial said: The Pakistani people remember with gratitude Chairman Liu Shaoqi's words, saying that if Pakistan's independence and sovereignty are threatened, 650 million Chinese people will help Pakistan.
    The editorial said: Both Pakistan and China "are eager to expand the scope and field of cooperation. We hope that Chairman Liu's visit will further strengthen the existing friendly relations between the two countries."
    The Daily News Service editorial said: "Relevant parties are doing everything possible to isolate the emerging countries of Asia and Africa. But they have failed miserably. They cannot prevent Pakistan and China from establishing close and friendly relations. Since Pakistan and China have common goals internationally, it is natural for them to develop friendly relations." The editorial said: China said that if Pakistan's sovereignty is threatened, China will stand with Pakistan, and we believe their words. We can also assure Chairman Liu that 100 million Pakistani people will forever stand with their 650 million Chinese brothers in the common struggle.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dacca, April 15th (via dispatch) - On the 15th, East Pakistani newspapers gave prominent coverage with vast space to warmly welcoming Chairman Liu Shaoqi's continued friendly visit to Pakistan in Dacca, the capital of East Pakistan, and hailed the friendship between the people of China and Pakistan.
    Dacca's newspapers published photos of the Chinese guests, and published editorials and articles introducing China's achievements. Some newspapers also used Chinese banner headlines: "Welcome Honored Guests," "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship." The Dacca Bengali newspaper Daily News Service also published a large photo of Chairman Mao Zedong and some of Mao's quotations in a special supplement issued for this day.
    The Morning News, published in Dacca, used a Chinese banner headline: "Welcome Honored Guests to Dacca." The newspaper published an editorial entitled "Friendship Blossoms" in both English and Chinese side by side, praising the friendship between China and Pakistan. The newspaper also published a sixteen-page supplement with content entirely about China. Many feature articles and pictures introduced China's achievements in economic and cultural construction and major events in the development of Sino-Pakistani friendship. In addition, Mao Zedong's famous poem "The Long March" and Chinese woodcuts were also published.
    The Morning News editorial said: "When millions of people joyfully and enthusiastically welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, who will arrive in Dacca today, people's hearts will leap with joy. They arrived in Dacca just in time for the Bengali New Year, which is an auspicious sign. These respected Chinese friends are about to come to East Pakistan. What could be a better New Year's gift than this? At the beginning of the year, what could be more indicative of a happier future?"
    The editorial said: "The Sino-Pakistani Joint Communiqué issued on March 31, 1966, emphasized that 'Sino-Pakistani friendship is not a matter of expediency, but has a solid foundation.'" The editorial said: "The bond tying China and Pakistan is strong and unbreakable. China aided us when India attacked our sacred territory last September, which proves that it is our friend in times of need. Friendship that has been tested in this way is like tempered steel."
    The editorial said: "The Joint Communiqué of March 31 also emphasized that 'the right to self-determination of the people of Kashmir must be respected, and the Kashmir dispute should be resolved in accordance with the wishes of the people of Kashmir, as guaranteed by Pakistan and India to the people of Kashmir.' This is a guarantee that Pakistan will never abandon, and for the sake of honor, Pakistan must fulfill this guarantee. Like China, Pakistan believes that there can be no compromise on fundamental principles."
    The editorial said: "Chairman Liu Shaoqi expressed his admiration for the heroic spirit shown by the Pakistani people in the struggle against Indian aggression. Because this admiration is expressed by a revolutionary hero of the great, heroic Chinese people, it has particularly significant meaning."
    The editorial said, "The heroic deeds of the Chinese people in war and peace are admired by millions of people in the world, and are a source of inspiration for those who are fighting against tyranny and aggression."
    The editorial said: "'Stepping across is like iron, now step forward from the beginning.' The indomitable spirit revealed in these two lines of Mao Zedong's poem has enabled the Chinese people to cross great rivers, climb heavily guarded mountains, and create incredible feats of heroism and tenacity. We pay tribute to the Chinese people, who have shown that nothing can hinder the people's progress, and even high mountains must bow to the will of the people." (Attached photo)
    On April 15th, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, accompanied by Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, arrived in Dacca by special plane for a friendly visit to East Pakistan. The Chinese guests were warmly welcomed by Pakistani President Muhammad Ayub Khan and East Pakistan Governor Abdul Monem Khan, as well as hundreds of thousands of citizens of Dacca lining the streets.

    达卡全市张灯结彩热烈欢迎刘主席访问
    公众领袖盛赞巴中人民患难之交的友谊是持久的友谊
    各报强调任何势力都不能阻挡巴中建立亲密友好关系
    新华社达卡十四日电　东巴基斯坦首府达卡市民正在热情地为欢迎刘少奇主席前来东巴基斯坦进行友好访问而忙碌着。
    在大街上，已经搭起了彩色缤纷的大型迎宾拱门。街道两旁挂起了巴中两国的国旗和红绿色的彩旗。公共的和私人的建筑物上装上了彩灯，使这个城市在晚上显出一片节日气氛。
    出现在这个城市的一些标语用孟加拉文写着：“中国是我们的朋友，被压迫人民的朋友，正义的维护者”，“人民中国万岁”。
    全巴基斯坦工人联合会成立了一个二十人的接待委员会，以便在刘少奇主席到达这里时给予他热烈欢迎。这个委员会由达卡市和郊区各工会组织的代表组成。
    有许多人从东巴基斯坦北部城镇来到达卡。铁道管理部门已经调拨出专车来把殷切希望参加欢迎刘少奇主席的人们从库米拉、米门辛格和达卡附近的其他县份送到达卡。这个城市的电讯局已经作了特别安排，以备在刘少奇主席访问期间发传真图片和挂长途电话。邮政部门也作了递送邮件的特别安排。
    达卡的报纸正在紧张地准备在中国客人到达的那天出版增刊，介绍中国在经济和文化建设上的成就。
    新华社达卡十四日电　东巴基斯坦公众领袖和各阶层人民热情欢迎刘少奇主席在结束了对西巴基斯坦的访问之后，到东巴基斯坦进行友好访问。
    著名公众领袖阿卜杜勒·哈密德汗·巴沙尼在一次集会上号召达卡市民向中国人民的领袖表示热烈欢迎。他说，中国人民在印度勾结帝国主义国家对巴基斯坦发动侵略战争的时候，坚决同巴基斯坦站在一起。而在当时，巴基斯坦的所谓朋友用一切办法帮助和鼓励印度侵略。他说，这应当使巴基斯坦人民知道，谁是他们的真心实意的朋友。
    巴沙尼还热情地赞扬中国始终支持亚非国家被压迫人民的事业，奉行和平的对外政策，并且是使正在为争取解放而斗争的全世界人民受到鼓舞的源泉。他说：“我们伟大的友好邻邦的国家首脑即将访问东巴基斯坦，他应该受到与他相称的接待。”
    据《巴基斯坦时报》报道，巴沙尼七日在一次谈话中还说，巴基斯坦同中国的友谊肯定是持久的友谊，因为这种友谊是两国八亿多人民的真诚愿望的顶点。
    民族人民党东巴基斯坦省工作委员会四月八日在达卡举行的一次会上通过一项决议说，在巴基斯坦困难的时刻，中国政府和人民提供了道义和物质上的支持。东巴基斯坦人民应该按照本国最好的传统来接待这位来自伟大友好国家的领导人，从而加强巴中友好和亚非团结的事业。
    达卡副专员纳齐尔也发表讲话，号召各界人民热烈欢迎刘少奇主席。
    全巴基斯坦劳工联合会主席哈伊和总书记沙阿·阿卜杜勒·哈利姆十三日对报界发表谈话，号召东巴基斯坦工人给伟大的中国人民的领导人最热烈的欢迎。
    东巴基斯坦机械大学中央学生会的负责人发表声明说，刘少奇主席的访问是“巴基斯坦的大光荣”。
    一项号召人们热情欢迎刘少奇主席的声明说：在巴基斯坦去年九月遭到背信弃义的侵略的时候，中国支持了巴基斯坦。中国领导人的来访“给了我们一个难得的机会来敞开我们的心表达我们的感激”。声明说：“这次欢迎可以显示我们的爱国心，显示一个伟大的民族对一个伟大的国家的感激，并且表示我们对帝国主义阴谋的不调和的仇恨。”
    连日来，东巴基斯坦报纸纷纷发表社论，欢迎刘少奇主席即将到东巴基斯坦进行友好访问。
    《巴基斯坦日报》在社论中说：“巴中友谊不仅对相互间的利益是必要的，而且对维护世界和平也是必要的。在最近的民族危机中（指印度去年九月侵略巴基斯坦），这种友谊的深度和真诚得到了证明。”它还说：“有人对巴中友谊这种越来越大的力量感到不痛快。但是尽管如此，我们还是确信这会进一步发扬光大。”
    《自由报》的社论热烈赞扬刘少奇主席在访问西巴基斯坦期间发表的关于中巴友谊的谈话。社论说：巴基斯坦人民以感激的心情记住刘少奇主席说的话，刘少奇主席说，如果巴基斯坦的独立和主权受到威胁，六亿五千万中国人民将帮助巴基斯坦。
    社论说：巴中两国“都切望扩大合作的规模和领域。我们希望，刘主席的访问将进一步加强两国之间现有的友好关系。”
    《传信日报》的社论说：“有关方面千方百计地使亚非新兴国家陷于孤立。但是他们悲惨地失败了。他们无法阻挡巴基斯坦和中国建立亲密友好关系。由于巴中两国在国际上有着共同的目标，它们发展友好关系是很自然的。”社论说：中国说，如果巴基斯坦的主权遭受威胁，中国将站在巴基斯坦一边，我们相信他们的话。我们方面也能向刘主席保证，一亿巴基斯坦人民在同他们的六亿五千万中国兄弟在共同的斗争中永远站在一起。
    新华社达卡十五日电　东巴基斯坦报纸十五日在最显著的地位用巨大的篇幅，热情地欢迎刘少奇主席到东巴基斯坦首府达卡继续对巴基斯坦进行友好访问，并欢呼中巴两国人民的友谊。
    达卡的报纸刊登了中国贵宾的照片，发表了社论和介绍中国成就的文章。有的报纸还用了中文的通栏大标题：《欢迎贵客》，《巴中友好万岁》。达卡孟加拉文报纸《传信日报》还在特别为这一天发行的增刊上登载了毛泽东主席的大照片和毛主席的一些语录。
    达卡出版的《晨报》用中文刊登了一条通栏大标题：《欢迎贵宾抵达卡》。这家报纸用英文和中文并排登载了一篇题为《友谊花开》的社论，盛赞中巴两国的友谊。这家报纸还出了内容全是关于中国的十六版增刊。许多特写文章和图片介绍了中国经济文化建设成就和中巴友谊发展的重大事件，此外还登载了毛泽东主席著名的诗《长征》和中国的木刻。
    《晨报》的这篇社论说：“在千千万万人欢腾热情地欢迎将在今天到达达卡的刘少奇主席和夫人的时候，人们的心都会高兴得跳起来。他们正好在孟加拉历新年的时候到达达卡，这是一个吉兆。这些可敬的中国朋友就要来到东巴基斯坦，哪里能有比这更好的新年礼物呢？在一年伊始的时候，哪里有比这更能预示着更幸福的未来呢？”
    社论说：“一九六六年三月三十一日发表的中国—巴基斯坦联合公报强调指出：‘巴中友好不是权宜之计，是有牢固基础的。’”社论说：“系结着中国和巴基斯坦的纽带是强有力的，是牢不可破的。去年九月印度进攻我国神圣领土的时候，中国援助了我们，这证明了它是我们患难时候的朋友。经过了这种考验的友谊就象是锻炼过的钢一样。”
    社论说：“三月三十一日的联合公报还强调指出，‘克什米尔人民的自决权利必须受到尊重，克什米尔争端应该同巴基斯坦和印度向克什米尔人民所保证的那样，按照克什米尔人民的愿望加以解决。’这是巴基斯坦决不会背弃的保证，为了荣誉，巴基斯坦必须履行这一保证。象中国一样，巴基斯坦认为，在根本原则问题上是不能妥协的。”
    社论说：“刘少奇主席对巴基斯坦人民在反对印度侵略的斗争中所表现的英勇气概表示了钦佩。由于这种钦佩是伟大的、英勇的中国人民的一位革命英雄表示的，它就有了特别重大的意义。”
    社论说，“中国人在战争与和平中的英雄事迹，使世界上千千万万的人感到钦佩，对那些为反对暴政和侵略而斗争的人，是一个鼓舞的源泉。”
    社论说：“‘雄关漫道真如铁，而今迈步从头越。’毛泽东这两句诗中流露出来的不屈不挠的精神，使得中国人民能够渡过大河，攀登重兵把守的高山，创造出英勇顽强的不可思议的事迹。我们向中国人民致敬，他们表明，任何东西也阻挠不了人民前进，就连高山也要向人民的意志低头。”（附图片）
    四月十五日，刘少奇主席和夫人，在陈毅副总理和夫人的陪同下，乘专机到达达卡，对东巴基斯坦进行友好访问。中国客人受到巴基斯坦总统穆罕默德·阿尤布·汗和东巴基斯坦省省督阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗，以及达卡的几十万市民夹道热烈欢迎。
