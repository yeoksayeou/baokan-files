    “Obsessed” in a Good Way
    One factory holiday morning, Wang Quanjin, an electrician at the Weihai Iron Factory, went to buy vegetables with a vegetable basket. In those days, the Weihai Factory was manufacturing "Sanji" (Three Machines); Wang Quanjin, who was originally a blacksmith and had only studied electrical engineering for one and a half months, was responsible for designing all the electrical circuits on the "Sanji." Wang Quanjin's mind was full of electrical matters, so much so that he couldn't eat well or sleep well. That day, carrying an empty basket, he went straight to an electrical appliance store again. There, he consulted and drew diagrams until 11:30 a.m. before returning home happily. What he carried in his hand was still an empty basket.
    People say that Wang Quanjin is obsessed with making machines.
    No, Wang Quanjin is not only obsessed with making machines, he is also obsessed with something much greater. That is to say, he is not only obsessed with innovation, but first and foremost with revolution. Only by becoming a "revolution obsessive" can one become a selfless "innovation obsessive."

    “迷”得好
    一个厂休日的早晨，卫海铁工厂电工王泉金，提着菜篮子去买菜。那些日子，卫海厂正在造“三机”；铁匠出身、仅仅只学过一个半月电工技术的王泉金，负责设计“三机”上的全部电器线路。王泉金脑子里尽想着电器的事，想得吃不好饭，睡不好觉，这天拎着一只空篮子，又径直向一家电器商店跑去。在那里，他又请教，又画图，直到十一点半，才喜洋洋地回家。手上提着的，还是一只空篮子。
    人们说，王泉金是造机器入了迷。
    不，王泉金迷的不仅是造机器，他迷的还有更远大得多的东西。就是说，他迷的不仅是革新，首先是革命。只有成为“革命迷”，才能成为忘我的“革新迷”。
