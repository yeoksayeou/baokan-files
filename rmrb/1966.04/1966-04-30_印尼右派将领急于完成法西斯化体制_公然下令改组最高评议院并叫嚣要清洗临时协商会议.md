    Xinhua News Agency, April 29th, Jakarta Dispatch: While massively purging communists and nationalist middle-of-the-road elements from the Cooperation Parliament and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, the Indonesian right-wing military regime recently also openly ordered the reorganization of the Supreme Advisory Council.
    According to a broadcast from Jakarta Radio, the Indonesian right-wing military regime issued a decree on the 23rd "deciding to dismiss all current members of the Supreme Advisory Council and appoint new members." Subsequently, on the 26th, this reactionary regime appointed sixty-six new members.
    An Associated Press dispatch on the 26th pointed out that "this action was taken by the iron-fisted Lieutenant General Suharto in the name of Sukarno, with the aim of weakening another of the president's tools of rule." This illustrates that the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique took this step to transform the Supreme Advisory Council, like the Cooperation Parliament and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, into a tool for implementing its dictatorial rule. The Indonesian Supreme Advisory Council was established on August 15, 1959. According to the 1945 Constitution, the Supreme Advisory Council is an advisory body to the President, its task is to answer the President's inquiries and has the right to make recommendations to the government.
  Xinhua News Agency, April 27th, Jakarta Dispatch: After ordering the dissolution of the Indonesian Communist Party and massively purging communists and nationalist middle-of-the-road elements from state institutions, the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique is now clamoring for a thorough "cleansing" of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, in order to further strike at intermediate forces and complete the fascist system.
    The Provisional People's Consultative Assembly is the highest organ of power in Indonesia, established in September 1960. Its members include deputies from all parties in the Cooperation Parliament and representatives from various regions and professional organizations. After seizing power, the right-wing generals' clique had already "cleansed" more than sixty members of the People's Consultative Assembly on April 8, who were accused of "suspected pro-communist activities."
    According to Jakarta Radio, Nasution, at a mass rally commemorating the 32nd anniversary of the founding of the right-wing youth organization Ansor Youth Movement on the 24th, frantically called for a "real cleansing" of the "fence-sitters" in the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly. He said, "Everything we have achieved now is only the first stage and is far from complete," and the 1945 Constitution "must be implemented." According to Western news agencies, Nasution also said that if the members of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly "are still yes-men, lacking backbone, the patriots of 1966 will rise up again," and he threatened, "They will eventually be crushed" and "suffer the same fate as others." The so-called "patriots of 1966" mentioned by Nasution in this speech are members of the "Indonesian University Students Action Unity" and the "Indonesian Youth and Students Action Unity," which are controlled by the right-wing generals' clique and are frantically carrying out anti-communist and anti-people riots throughout Indonesia.
    Nasution's repeated recent clamoring for "thorough cleansing of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly" and "implementing" the 1945 Constitution aims to cleanse all members of nationalist parties from the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, and to use the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, which is completely controlled by the right-wing generals' clique, to completely get rid of President Sukarno, who currently retains only an empty title.

    印尼右派将领急于完成法西斯化体制
    公然下令改组最高评议院并叫嚣要清洗临时协商会议
    新华社二十九日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派军人政权在从合作国会和临时人民协商会议中大批清洗共产党人和民族主义中间分子的同时，最近还公然下令改组了最高评议院。
    据雅加达电台广播，印度尼西亚右派军人政权二十三日发布决定书，“决定将最高评议院现有全体成员免职并另委任新的成员”。随后，在二十六日，这个反动政权就任命了六十六名新成员。
    美联社二十六日的消息指出，“这一行动是铁腕人物苏哈托中将以苏加诺的名义采取的，目的是削弱总统的另一个统治工具。”这说明印度尼西亚右派将领集团采取这个步骤，是为了把最高评议院同合作国会和临时人民协商会议一样，变为它实行独裁统治的御用工具。印度尼西亚最高评议院成立于一九五九年八月十五日。根据一九四五年宪法，最高评议院是总统的谘询机构，它的任务是答复总统的询问，并有权向政府提出建议。
  据新华社二十七日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团在下令解散印度尼西亚共产党和从国家机构中大批清洗共产党人和民族主义中间分子之后，又在叫嚣要彻底“清洗”临时人民协商会议，以便进一步打击中间势力，完成法西斯化体制。
    临时人民协商会议是印度尼西亚最高权力机关，成立于一九六○年九月，成员中有合作国会的各党派议员，各地区和专业团体的代表。右派将领集团在夺取政权后，已在四月八日“清洗了”六十多名所谓“有从事亲共活动嫌疑的”人民协商会议的成员。
    据雅加达电台广播，纳苏蒂安二十四日在纪念右派青年组织安索青年团成立三十二周年的群众集会上，狂叫要“真正清洗”临时人民协商会议中的“骑墙派”。他说：“现时我们所已经取得的一切，只是第一阶段而且还远未完成”，一九四五年宪法“必须贯彻执行”。据西方通讯社报道，纳苏蒂安还说，如果临时人民协商会议的成员“仍然是应声虫，毫无骨气，一九六六年的志士将再次起义”，他并威胁说，“他们终有一天会被粉碎”，“遭到别人遭到的那种下场”。纳苏蒂安在这个讲话中提到的所谓“一九六六年的志士”，就是右派将领集团所控制的、在印度尼西亚各地疯狂进行反共、反人民骚乱活动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”的成员。
    纳苏蒂安最近一再叫嚷要“彻底清洗临时人民协商会议”和“贯彻执行”一九四五年宪法，其目的是要把民族主义政党的成员全部清洗出临时人民协商会议，并且利用右派将领集团完全控制下的临时人民协商会议来彻底搞掉目前仅仅保留空名的苏加诺总统。
