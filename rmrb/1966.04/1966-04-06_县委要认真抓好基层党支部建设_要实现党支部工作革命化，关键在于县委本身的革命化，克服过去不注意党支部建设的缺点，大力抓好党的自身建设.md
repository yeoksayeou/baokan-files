    Mao Zedong said: "The Chinese Communist Party is the core of leadership of the entire Chinese people. Without such a core, the socialist cause cannot be victorious." In order to give full play to the role of the leadership core, we must continuously strengthen Party building, especially the building of the Party's grassroots organizations.
    The key to strengthening Party building is to arm the minds of all Party members with Mao Zedong Thought, so that Party cadres and Party members can more consciously transform their subjective world and then transform the objective world in accordance with the positions, viewpoints, and methods of Mao Zedong Thought.
    Under the advocacy of Comrade Mao Zedong, our Party has established excellent work styles in the struggle against all enemies at home and abroad and in the process of strengthening Party building. This is mainly the style of combining theory with practice, the style of maintaining close ties with the masses, and the style of self-criticism. Our Party carried forward these three major styles, leading the broad masses of revolutionary people, and won the victory of the people's great revolution. In socialist revolution and socialist construction, our Party further developed the three major styles and achieved one victory after another. At present, the Party's grassroots organizations must strive to study Mao Zedong Thought, highlight politics, take class struggle as the key link, educate the broad masses of Party members, further carry forward the three major styles, and build the Party branches into strong fighting fortresses. When Party building is strengthened and the core strength is strengthened, we can better lead the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment, better complete the Party's various political tasks, better carry out socialist revolution and socialist construction, and better support the world people's revolution.
    In order to exchange experiences in Party building, especially the experiences in building Party grassroots organizations, this newspaper has decided to open a "Party Life" special column. We believe that this special column will certainly receive strong support from Party organizations at all levels and all Party members, and we will work together to run it well. The Editor
    County Party Committee Must Conscientiously Grasp the Construction of Basic-Level Party Branches
    To achieve the revolutionization of Party branch work, the key lies in the revolutionization of the county Party committee itself, overcoming the shortcomings of neglecting Party branch construction in the past, and vigorously grasping the Party's own construction.
    Organization Department of the Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province; Organization Department of the Yicheng County Committee
    The Party's basic-level branch is the fighting unit for the Party to carry out ideological and political work among the masses, and it is the fighting fortress to ensure the implementation of the Party's policies and the completion of various production tasks. Therefore, strengthening the construction of basic-level branches is the key to leading and doing all kinds of work well. The Yicheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China in Shanxi Province, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and taking class struggle and the two-road struggle as the key link, is vigorously grasping the work of building Dazhai-style Party branches in rural areas in the process of realizing its own ideological revolutionization and work style revolutionization.
    Clarified the relationship between branch construction and production
    The Yicheng County Party Committee responded to the call of the Provincial Party Committee, unified its understanding through serious study and discussion, and formulated a plan for the county to build stable and high-yield farmland during the Third Five-Year Plan. In order to realize this plan, the County Party Committee held an enlarged meeting, starting from summarizing historical experiences and lessons, and proposed that it must learn from Dazhai's experience, carry forward Dazhai's spirit, and strive to realize the farmland construction plan. During the discussion, there were two different ideological understandings. Some people believed that to achieve the plan of building stable and high-yield farmland, it is necessary to grasp the construction of Dazhai-style Party branches, rely on qualified Party branches, and lead the people to complete production and construction tasks. Others disagreed with grasping Party branch construction, believing that as long as Dazhai's specific experience in farmland construction is promoted and production is done well, branch work will also be done well.
    In response to different ideological understandings, the County Party Committee's enlarged meeting focused on discussing the following question: Why is Dazhai's production and construction so solid? By presenting facts, making comparisons, and talking about experiences, everyone realized that Dazhai's production is solid because the Party branch leadership is solid. This solidity is mainly manifested in five aspects: First, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, reading Chairman Mao's books, listening to Chairman Mao's words, and handling affairs according to Chairman Mao's instructions. Second, first, there must be a branch secretary who is politically strong, democratic in work style, and able to play a model role in production, and a branch committee organized by thorough revolutionaries headed by him; and with the branch committee as the core, cultivate and unite a handful of thorough revolutionaries inside and outside the Party, closely connect with the masses through various organizations, and form an absolute advantage of revolutionary forces. Third, adhere to democratic centralism, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and maintain the unity of all members of the branch on the basis of Party principles. Fourth, adhere to the Party's class line in rural areas, resolutely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and consciously accept the supervision of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Fifth, have lofty socialist and communist ideals, resolutely implement the policy of self-reliance, give full play to the revolutionary spirit of transforming the world, strictly follow the scientific attitude of seeking truth from facts and proceeding from reality, and resolutely complete the various tasks proposed by the Party. It is precisely because these five aspects are solid that Dazhai's production and construction are solid.
    During the discussion, everyone also saw that the conditions of many brigades in Yicheng County were better than those of Dazhai, but their production and construction were far inferior to those of Dazhai. The fundamental reason is that they did not build a Dazhai-style Party branch. Some advanced brigades in Yicheng County have been advanced in production for many years because of the leadership of a strong Party branch. Some originally backward brigades have been able to become advanced brigades because they have vigorously grasped the construction of Party branches. For example, the Dongsucheng Brigade had work teams to help with the work every year in the past, but because they only grasped things like urging plowing and sowing, the backwardness could not be changed in the end. Since last year, through the flexible study and application of Mao Zedong's works, the branch leadership has been strengthened, promoting the ideological revolutionization of Party members and cadres, thereby driving the broad masses of commune members to actively participate in collective labor, and changing the land with advanced ideas. One thousand mu of hillside land has been cultivated with dikes, and one thousand mu of flat land has been turned into water land. This shows that once Party branch construction is grasped, production construction will change.
    By presenting facts and reasoning, we saw from summarizing and comparing that whichever Party branch learns from Dazhai well, the leadership of that Party branch is solid; whichever Party branch leadership is solid, the production and construction of that brigade is solid. Conversely, whichever Party branch learns from Dazhai poorly and neglects the construction of the branch itself, the production and construction of that brigade will not be outstanding. Thus, it is further recognized that with a Dazhai-style Party branch, there can be everything Dazhai-style, and the key to grasping production construction is to grasp the construction of the Party branch.
    Cultivate and improve the leadership core of the Party branch
    To build a Dazhai-style Party branch, the first thing to do is to establish a good leadership core headed by the branch secretary. After the Provincial Party Committee's enlarged meeting last October, in order to strengthen the leadership core of the brigade Party branch, improve the leadership level, and promote mountain and water management, the Yicheng County Party Committee, after investigation and research, appropriately adjusted a part of the branch's positive and negative secretaries and brigade captains. A total of 134 Party branch secretaries and brigade captains were newly selected last year. They are highly conscious, full of drive, actively involved in labor, unafraid of difficulties, and dare to shoulder heavy burdens. The work of these branches has become active.
    In order to improve the leadership level of all Party branches, in addition to the county and commune work teams providing specific guidance and assistance to the new leadership backbone, the County Party Committee also adopted a method of centralized training to improve their ideological and political level and work ability. Since last winter, the Party committees of various communes have combined the current central work and used about three days to conduct a general training for Party branch secretaries. The County Party Committee spent half a month at the County Party School to conduct centralized training for 350 people, including all Party branch secretaries in the county, some brigade Communist Youth League secretaries, militia company commanders, women's directors, and newly selected training targets. In the training, taking Chen Yonggui, secretary of the Dazhai Brigade Party Branch, and Zhou Mingshan, former secretary of the Nanliu Brigade Party Branch, as models, combined with their own ideological reality and work reality, they talked about their experiences, found shortcomings, learned from experiences, and put forward measures, focusing on discussing: "How to study Chairman Mao's works well?" "How to be a good branch secretary?" "How to learn to do ideological and political work for the masses?" "How to give play to the role of various system organizations?" and other four questions. The leadership backbone of the county's original 70-odd branches was relatively weak, and through centralized training and cultivation in actual work, the leadership level has been improved. The Party branch of the Futu Brigade of the Zhongwei Commune, with five young people among the seven branch committee members, is very energetic, but the working methods are simple. After the help of the resident cadres and centralized training, they consulted Chairman Mao's works when they had problems and consulted with the masses when they had difficulties, which greatly improved the leadership level of the Party branch.
    Strive to promote the ideological revolutionization of Party members and cadres
    While improving and strengthening the leadership core of the branch, the Party branches of major brigades, in view of the common ideological problems existing among Party members and cadres in each period and each task, with the delimitation of the boundaries between the vanguard and the ordinary masses and the boundaries between the two roads of capitalism and socialism as the key link, launched a "small rectification" campaign among Party members and cadres to continuously promote the ideological revolutionization of Party members and cadres.
    After the Provincial Party Committee issued the call to build stable and high-yield farmland, the vast majority of Party members and cadres responded positively and quickly took action. However, a small number of Party members and cadres also had feelings of fear of difficulty and reliance on the state. They said: "Our dry slopes lack water sources. Not to mention developing water conservancy, even building Dazhai farmland cannot be done without state investment." The County Party Committee seized this idea and universally carried out a "small rectification" within the Party. The Party branches of major brigades carried out comparative education for Party members and cadres, using Dazhai as a model. The Mache Brigade of the Wuci Commune has more than 200 mu of land among the 2,000 mu of land that is high and cannot be irrigated. If it is renovated, it can all be turned into water land. However, some Party members and cadres have the idea of relying on state support. They said: "As long as the state gives us machines, we can pump the water up." In response to this idea, the leading comrades of the County Party Committee helped the branch carry out a "small rectification" within the Party, taking Dazhai as an example, comparing conditions, comparing enthusiasm, comparing output, and comparing contributions. Everyone improved their awareness and realized that it was not that the water could not go up, but that the thinking could not go up. Under the leadership of Party members and cadres, after two months of hard work, two new 1,000-meter-long channels were built, 11 old channels were renovated, and 32 gate openings were built, so that all 2,000 mu of land in the brigade was turned into water land.
    The County Party Committee must grasp Party branch work
    To achieve the revolutionization of Party branch work, the key lies in the revolutionization of the county Party committee itself, overcoming the shortcomings of neglecting Party branch construction work in the past, and vigorously grasping the Party's own construction. As early as 1964, the Yicheng County Party Committee implemented a system in which Party member responsible cadres of county-level agencies went deep into the grassroots to stay in contact with fixed branches. Practice has proved that this is not only a way to realize the work style revolutionization of Party member responsible cadres, but also an important measure to strengthen leadership over grassroots Party organizations. Since last winter, the Yicheng County Party Committee, from top to bottom, with the leadership taking the lead, through summary appraisal, adjustment and rectification, has further organized Party member responsible cadres at the county and commune levels to go to the countryside to stay at fixed Party branches. More than 100 Party member responsible cadres from the county-level agencies, from the secretary and standing committee members to the heads of sections and bureaus, and more than 90 Party member cadres from the commune, from the Party committee secretary to the general Party member cadres, have all gone deep into the grassroots to stay at fixed Party branches, helping the rural Party branches improve their leadership level.
    After the county and commune cadres went deep down, they generally adhered to the working methods of "one lead", "three helps" and "one cultivation". "One lead" is to take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works and influence and drive the members of the rural Party branch to study Chairman Mao's works with their own exemplary actions. "Three helps" are to help rural branches flexibly study and apply the work experience of the Dazhai Party branch and summarize their own experience; help the Party branch cultivate and improve the leadership core; help the Party branch establish three systems and vigorously promote the March 8th style. "One cultivation" is to cultivate local Dazhai-style Party branches, establish flags, and carry out "one belt two" activities. In order to grasp the situation and guide the overall work, the County Party Committee focused on listening to the reports of comrades staying at fixed branches once a quarter, summarized experience from them, promoted the overall situation, discovered problems, and solved them in a timely manner. After the County Party Committee adopted the above measures, it greatly improved the combat effectiveness of the rural Party branch.
    With the strengthening of the leadership of the Party branch and the ideological revolutionization of Party members and cadres, the original advanced branches have become more advanced, and a number of backward branches have also begun to become active. The role of Party members has also been further brought into play. Farmland water conservancy construction has also been done better than in the past.

专栏：

    毛泽东同志说：“中国共产党是全中国人民的领导核心。没有这样一个核心，社会主义事业就不能胜利。”为了充分发挥领导核心的作用，我们必须不断加强党的建设，特别是党的基层组织的建设。
    加强党的建设的关键，是用毛泽东思想武装全体党员的头脑，使党的干部和党员群众，更加自觉地按照毛泽东思想的立场、观点和方法，改造自己的主观世界，进而改造客观世界。
    在毛泽东同志倡导下，我们党在同国内外一切敌人的斗争中，在加强党的建设的过程中，树立了优良的工作作风。这主要的就是理论和实践相结合的作风，和人民群众紧密地联系一起的作风以及自我批评的作风。我们党发扬这三大作风，领导广大革命人民，赢得了人民大革命的胜利。在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，我们党进一步发扬三大作风，取得了一个又一个的胜利。当前，党的基层组织，必须努力学习毛泽东思想，突出政治，以阶级斗争为纲，教育广大党员，进一步发扬三大作风，把党的支部建设成为坚强的战斗堡垒。党的建设加强了，核心力量加强了，就能更好地领导阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动，更好地完成党的各项政治任务，更好地进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设，更好地支持世界人民的革命。
    为了交流党的建设的经验，特别是党的基层组织建设的经验，本报决定开辟“党的生活”专刊。我们相信，这一专刊一定会得到全党各级组织和全体党员的大力支持，共同把它办好。　编者
    县委要认真抓好基层党支部建设
    要实现党支部工作革命化，关键在于县委本身的革命化，克服过去不注意党支部建设的缺点，大力抓好党的自身建设
    山西省晋南地委组织部　翼城县委组织部
    党的基层支部是党在群众中进行思想政治工作的战斗单位，是保证党的方针政策的实施和完成各项生产任务的战斗堡垒。因此，加强基层支部建设是领导和做好各项工作的关键。中共山西省翼城县委员会，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，在实现自身思想革命化和工作作风革命化的过程中，在农村狠抓建设大寨式党支部的工作。
    明确了支部建设和生产的关系
    翼城县委响应省委的号召，经过认真的学习和讨论，统一了认识，制订出全县在第三个五年计划期间建设稳产高产农田的计划。为了实现这一计划，县委召开了扩大会议，从总结历史经验教训入手，提出必须学习大寨经验，发扬大寨精神，为实现农田建设计划而奋斗。在讨论中，有两种不同的思想认识。有人认为要实现建设稳产高产田计划，必须狠抓建设大寨式党支部，靠过硬的党支部，领导人民群众完成生产建设任务。有人却不同意抓紧党支部建设，认为只要推广大寨建设农田的具体经验，把生产搞好了，支部工作也就随之搞好了。
    针对不同的思想认识，在县委扩大会上，集中讨论了这样一个问题：大寨的生产建设为什么能过硬？通过摆事实，作对比，谈体会，明道理，使大家认识到，大寨生产所以过硬，就是因为党支部领导过硬。这个硬主要表现在五个方面：第一，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事。第二，首先有政治上坚强，作风民主，在生产上能起模范作用的支部书记，和以他为首的彻底革命派组织的支部委员会；并且以支委会为核心，培养团结一把子党内外的彻底革命派，通过各种组织，密切联系群众，形成革命力量的绝对优势。第三，坚持执行民主集中制，开展批评与自我批评，保持支部全体成员在党的原则基础上的团结一致。第四，坚持党在农村的阶级路线，坚决依靠贫下中农，自觉接受贫下中农的监督。第五，具有社会主义、共产主义的远大理想，坚决贯彻执行自力更生的方针，充分发挥改天换地的革命干劲，严格按照实事求是、从实际出发的科学态度办事，坚决完成党所提出的各项任务。正是由于这五个方面过硬，大寨的生产建设才过得硬。
    在讨论中，大家也看到，翼城县不少大队条件比大寨好而生产建设却远不如大寨，根本原因就是没有建设起一个大寨式党支部。翼城县有些先进大队，多年来生产上一直先进，就是因为有坚强的党支部的领导。有些原来后进的大队所以能变为先进大队，也是因为狠抓了党支部的建设。例如，东寿城大队，过去年年有工作组去帮助工作，因为只抓催耕催种等生产上的事，结果老改变不了落后面貌。去年以来，通过活学活用毛主席著作，加强了支部领导，促进了党员、干部思想革命化，从而带动广大社员积极参加集体劳动，以先进的思想换来了土地变样，一千亩坡地培起了地埂，一千亩平地变成了水地。这就说明，一抓党支部建设，生产建设就会变样。
    通过摆事实，讲道理，从总结和对比中看到：哪个党支部学习大寨好，哪个党支部领导就过硬；哪个党支部领导过硬，哪个大队的生产建设就过硬。反之，哪个党支部学习大寨差，忽视了支部本身的建设，哪个大队生产建设就不出色。从而进一步认识到，有了大寨式的党支部，才能有大寨式的一切，要抓好生产建设，关键在抓好党的支部建设。
    培养和提高党支部的领导核心
    要建设一个大寨式的党支部，首先得建立一个以支部书记为首的好的领导核心。去年十月省委扩大会议以后，翼城县委，为了加强大队党支部领导核心，提高领导水平，推动治山治水工作，经过调查研究，适当调整了一部分支部正副书记和大队长。去年新选拔的党支部书记和大队长共有一百三十四人。他们觉悟高，干劲足，劳动积极，不怕困难，敢挑重担。这些支部的工作就活跃起来了。
    为了提高所有党支部的领导水平，县委除了对新的领导骨干，采取由县、社工作组具体指导帮助以外，还采用集中训练的方法，提高他们的思想政治水平和工作能力。去冬以来，各公社党委结合当前中心工作，以三天左右的时间，对党支部书记普遍进行了一次训练。县委在县党校以半月时间对全县党支部书记和部分大队团支部书记、民兵连长、妇女主任以及新选拔的培养对象共三百五十人进行了集中训练。在训练中，以大寨大队党支部书记陈永贵和南柳大队前党支部书记周明山为样板，联系本人思想实际和工作实际，谈心得，找差距，学经验，提措施，集中讨论了：“怎样学好毛主席著作？”“怎样当好支部书记？”“怎样学会做群众的思想政治工作？”“怎样发挥各系统组织作用？”等四个问题。全县原有七十几个支部领导骨干比较弱，通过集中训练和在实际工作中培养，领导水平有了提高。中卫公社浮图大队党支部，七个支部委员五个是年轻人，干劲很大，但是工作方法简单。经过驻队干部帮助和集中训练后，他们有问题就向毛主席著作请教，有困难就找群众共同商量，使党支部领导水平大大提高。
    努力促进党员、干部思想革命化
    在健全和加强支部领导核心的同时，各大队党支部，针对每个时期和每项工作在党员、干部中所存在的有普遍性的思想问题，以划清先锋队和普通群众的界限，资本主义和社会主义两条道路的界限为纲，在党员、干部中开展了“小整风”活动，不断促进党员、干部思想革命化。
    省委发出建设稳产高产农田号召后，绝大部分党员、干部积极响应，很快行动起来。但也有少数党员、干部有畏难情绪和依赖国家的思想。他们说：“咱这旱坡地，水源缺乏，不要说发展水利，就是建设大寨田离了国家投资也不行。”县委抓住了这种思想，普遍在党内开展了一次“小整风”。各大队党支部以大寨为样板，对党员、干部进行了对比教育。武池公社马册大队，两千亩土地中有二百多亩地势高浇不上水，如经过整修全可以变成水地。可是，有些党员、干部有依赖国家支援的思想，他们说：“只要国家给机器，就能把水提上去。”县委领导同志针对这种思想，帮助支部在党内进行一次“小整风”，以大寨为榜样，通过比条件，比干劲，比产量，比贡献，大家提高了觉悟，认识到不是水上不去，是思想上不去。在党员、干部带头下，奋战两个月，新建了一千米长的渠道两条，整修旧渠道十一条，打闸口三十二个，使大队两千亩土地全部变成了水地。
    县委必须抓党支部工作
    要实现党支部工作革命化，关键在于县委本身的革命化，克服过去不注意党支部建设工作的缺点，大力抓好党的自身建设。早在一九六四年，翼城县委就实行了县直机关党员负责干部深入蹲点，固定联系支部的制度。实践证明，这不仅是实现党员负责干部作风革命化的一条办法，而且是加强对基层党组织领导的一条重要措施。去冬以来，翼城县委自上而下，领导带头，通过总结评比，调整整顿，进一步组织县、社两级党员负责干部下乡蹲点或固定联系党支部。县级机关从书记、常委到科局长以上的党员负责干部一百多人，公社从党委书记到一般党员干部九十多人，都深入到基层蹲点或固定联系一个支部，帮助农村党支部提高领导水平。
    县、社干部同志深入下去以后，一般都坚持了“一带头”，“三帮助”，“一培养”的工作方法。“一带头”就是带头学习毛主席著作，以自己的模范行动影响和带动农村党支部成员学习毛主席著作。“三帮助”就是帮助农村支部活学活用大寨党支部工作经验，总结自己经验；帮助党支部培养和提高领导核心；帮助党支部建立三项制度，大兴三八作风。“一培养”就是培养当地大寨式党支部，树立旗帜，开展“一带二”活动。县委为了掌握情况，指导全面工作，每季度重点听取一次蹲点和联系支部的同志的汇报，从中总结经验，推动全面，发现问题，及时解决。县委采取以上措施后，大大提高了农村党支部的战斗力。
    随着党支部领导的加强和党员干部思想革命化，原来的先进支部，更加先进了，一批后进的支部，也开始活跃起来。党员的作用也进一步得到发挥。农田水利建设也比过去搞得好。
