    The key to running China's state-owned farms well lies in following the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, proceeding from the actual conditions of China's countryside, and taking our own path for state-owned farms. Facts prove that state-owned farms that have done this have become better and better, making ever greater contributions to the country.

    Comrade Mao Zedong taught us: "To decide work policies according to actual conditions is the most basic working method that all communists must firmly remember." State-owned farms are similar to state-owned factories in terms of ownership, but they are, after all, state-owned agricultural enterprises, not state-owned industrial enterprises. They differ from state-owned factories in many ways and should not simply adopt the existing methods of state-owned factories. They have many things in common with production teams of people's communes, and should learn all the excellent management methods of the production teams. Especially important is that state-owned farms are located in rural areas, and their operational policies, management systems, and even work styles and methods should proceed from the actual conditions of the countryside and fully consider the characteristics of rural areas.

    State-owned farms engage in agricultural production in a rural environment. Do the staff of state-owned farms have a good understanding of the countryside? Do they deal with the problems of state-owned farms from the current actual conditions of China's countryside, or do they deal with the problems of state-owned farms from the perspective of the city, from the perspective of industry, or from the perspective of foreigners running farms? This is something that the cadres of state-owned farms, especially the leading cadres, should seriously consider.

    What does it mean to run state-owned farms from the actual conditions of China's countryside? This means that all the work of state-owned farms should be suited to the characteristics of the countryside, should be conducive to the faster development of productive forces, should be conducive to giving play to the labor enthusiasm of all personnel, should be conducive to close ties between state-owned farms and the production teams of people's communes, and should be conducive to the gradual elimination of the differences between workers and peasants, between urban and rural areas, and between manual and mental labor, to create conditions for our country's future transition to communism.

    Once these issues are resolved ideologically, it becomes clear what policies state-owned farms should adopt and what management systems they should formulate.

    In terms of developing production, it is necessary to resolutely implement the policy of "taking agriculture as the main occupation, combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and engaging in diversified operations." Fully tap the labor potential of state-owned farms, fully utilize the natural resources of state-owned farms, open up a wide range of production avenues, provide the state with as many agricultural and sideline products as possible, more powerfully support national construction; at the same time, continuously increase the capital accumulation of the farms, carry out farm capital construction through self-reliance, and consolidate and strengthen the state-owned farm economy more quickly.

    In terms of labor management, it is necessary to absorb all people with the ability to work to participate in production labor. A state-owned farm is actually a small society. There, there are not only agricultural workers, but also workers in various industries such as industry, commerce, culture, education, and health, as well as a large number of staff and workers’ families. Many of them have a certain ability to work and have the desire and willingness to serve the people. If it is mechanically stipulated that only people of a certain age can participate in farm labor, many people with the ability to work will be excluded. This is not only not conducive to the farm better implementing the policy of "taking agriculture as the main occupation, combining agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, and engaging in diversified operations," but also creates a "urban population" in the farm, increasing the burden on the farm and the state. We should organize all people with the ability to work and enable them to participate in labor within their capacity, which can not only increase wealth for society, but also facilitate political and ideological work on them, realizing the revolutionization of the staff and worker's families.

    In terms of the distribution system, it is necessary to gradually implement the method of fixed quota accounting and payment according to points within the reasonably determined total wage amount, so as to better implement the socialist distribution principle of distribution according to labor, more pay for more work, and equal pay for equal work. Because this distribution method is basically the same as the current distribution policy of the production teams of the people's communes, the labor of farm workers and commune members is roughly the same, and their income is also roughly the same. This is conducive to strengthening unity between them and conducive to the development and consolidation of the production teams of the people's communes.

    In terms of financial management, it is necessary to implement the policy of hard work and thrift, strive to save all expenses that can be saved, especially to save all non-productive expenses that can be saved. With the development of farm production, the living welfare of staff and workers and their families should be improved and enhanced; but it is necessary to resolutely oppose the adoption of foreign and urban practices. Otherwise, it will not gradually narrow the differences, but may expand the differences; it will not be conducive to strengthening the unity between farm staff and workers and their families and the peasants, but may hinder the unity between them, producing a bad influence on building a new socialist countryside. This tendency must be resolutely prevented.

    Revolutionary rules and regulations rely on revolutionary people to formulate and implement them. Therefore, to run state-owned farms well, it is not only necessary to establish a complete set of management systems that conform to the Party's general line for socialist construction and are suitable for the characteristics of China's state-owned farms, but also to establish a contingent of farm staff and workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought and with a high degree of socialist consciousness, especially to establish a revolutionized farm leadership team. Only by first realizing the revolutionization of the leadership can it be possible to realize the revolutionization of the staff and workers and the revolutionization of the entire enterprise. Party committees at all levels must strengthen the leadership over state-owned farms, and the most important thing is to strengthen the political and ideological leadership over the leading cadres of the farms, and to help the farms establish and improve the system of political and ideological work. Everyone on the farm, from leading cadres to staff and worker’s families, should earnestly read Comrade Mao Zedong's books, constantly improve their socialist consciousness, establish the view of farming for the revolution and running farms for the revolution, and promote the work of state-owned farms to advance by leaps and bounds.

    Since the nationwide liberation, especially in recent years, China's state-owned farms have made great progress. The grain and cotton output of hundreds of state-owned farms across the country has reached or exceeded the targets stipulated in the "National Program for Agricultural Development." These advanced state-owned farms, especially the Jiangxi Hetang Reclamation Farm, the Fourth Division Twelfth Regiment Farm of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, the Jiangsu Nantong Farm, the Guangdong Zhujiang Farm, and the Dongtai Farm, which have been commended by the Ministry of Land Reclamation, have always acted in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought, and have accumulated rich experience in exploring and creating Chinese-style state-owned farms. The recently held National Land Reclamation Work Conference, on the basis of conscientiously summarizing past work, further clearly proposed that the key to running state-owned farms well is to use Mao Zedong Thought to command all the work of state-owned farms, proceed from China's actual conditions, and firmly take our own path. We believe that after this conference, China's state-owned farms will be run better and make greater contributions to the country's socialist construction.

### 办好国营农场的关键何在

    办好国营农场的关键何在
    办好我国的国营农场的关键，是在毛泽东思想指导下，从我国农村的实际出发，走我国国营农场自己的道路。事实证明，凡是这样作的国营农场，都是越办越好，对国家的贡献越来越大。
    毛泽东同志教导我们：“按照实际情况决定工作方针，这是一切共产党员所必须牢牢记住的最基本的工作方法。”国营农场，在所有制方面相同于国营工厂，但它毕竟不是国营的工业企业，而是国营的农业企业。它有许多地方不同于国营工厂，不应当搬用国营工厂的一套现成作法。它有许多地方同于人民公社生产队，应当学习人民公社生产队的一切优良的经营管理方法。尤其重要的是，国营农场处在农村，它的办场方针、经营管理制度以至工作作风和工作方法，都应当从农村的实际情况出发，充分考虑农村的特点。
    国营农场在农村环境中从事农业生产。国营农场的工作人员，是不是很好地了解了农村呢？他们是从目前我国农村的实际情况出发，去处理国营农场的问题，还是从城市观点，从工业的观点，从外国人办农场的观点出发，去处理国营农场的问题呢？这是值得国营农场的干部、特别是领导干部，很好地加以考虑的。
    从我国农村的实际出发来办国营农场，这是什么意思呢？这就是说，国营农场的一切工作，应当适合农村的特点，应当有利于更快地发展生产力，有利于发挥一切人员的劳动积极性，有利于密切国营农场同人民公社生产队的联系，有利于逐步消灭工农差别、城乡差别、体力劳动和脑力劳动的差别，为我国在将来过渡到共产主义创造条件。
    从思想上解决了这些问题，国营农场应当采取什么方针，制订什么经营管理制度，就很清楚了。
    在发展生产上，它要坚决执行“一业为主，农林牧结合，多种经营”的方针。充分地挖掘国营农场的劳动潜力，充分地利用国营农场的自然资源，广开生产门路，尽可能地为国家提供更多的农副产品，更有力地支援国家建设；同时不断地增加农场的资金积累，自力更生地进行农场基本建设，更快地巩固和壮大国营农场经济。
    在劳动力的管理上，它要吸收一切有劳动能力的人参加生产劳动。一个国营农场，实际上就是一个小社会。在那里，不但有农业工人，有工业、商业和文教卫生等各行各业的工作人员，而且有为数很多的职工家属。他们中间的许多人有一定的劳动能力，有为人民服务的要求和愿望。如果机械地规定只有多少岁到多少岁的人才能参加农场劳动，就会把许多有劳动能力的人排除在外。这样，不但不利于农场更好地执行“一业为主，农林牧结合，多种经营”的方针，而且会出现农场中的“城市人口”，增加农场和国家的负担。我们应该把一切有劳动能力的人都组织起来，使他们都能参加力所能及的劳动，既可以为社会增加财富，又便于对他们进行政治思想工作，实现职工家属的革命化。
    在分配制度上，它要逐步推行在合理核定的工资总额内，实行定额记分、按分付酬的办法，更好地贯彻按劳付酬、多劳多得、同工同酬的社会主义分配原则。由于这种分配方法同人民公社生产队现行的分配政策基本相同，农场工人同公社社员从事的劳动大体相同，他们所得的收入也大体相同。这就有利于加强他们之间的团结，有利于人民公社生产队的发展和巩固。
    在财务管理上，它要贯彻执行艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的方针，努力节省一切可以节省的开支，尤其要节省一切可以节省的非生产性开支。随着农场生产的发展，职工及其家属的生活福利，应当有所改善和提高；但是一定要坚决反对搬用外国的和城市的一套做法。否则，就不是逐步缩小差别，而可能扩大差别；就不利于加强农场职工及其家属同农民的团结，而可能妨碍他们之间的团结，对于建设社会主义新农村产生不好的影响。这种倾向必须坚决防止。
    革命的规章制度，依靠革命的人来制订和执行。因此，要办好国营农场，就不但要建立一整套符合党的社会主义建设总路线的、适合于我国国营农场特点的经营管理制度，而且要建立一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的、具有高度社会主义觉悟的农场职工队伍，尤其要建立一个革命化的农场领导班子。只有首先实现了领导革命化，才有可能实现职工的革命化，实现整个企业的革命化。各地党委要加强对于国营农场的领导，最主要的就是要加强对于农场领导干部的政治思想领导，要帮助农场把政治思想工作制度建立健全起来。农场的每个人，从领导干部到职工家属，都应当认真读毛泽东同志的书，不断地提高社会主义觉悟，树立为革命种田、为革命办农场的观点，推动国营农场的工作大踏步地前进。
    全国解放以来，特别是近几年来，我国国营农场有了很大的发展。全国有数百个国营农场的粮、棉产量，已经达到或超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。这些先进的国营农场，特别是受到农垦部表扬的江西荷塘垦殖场、新疆生产建设兵团四师十二团农场、江苏南通农场、广东珠江农场、东泰农场，一贯按照毛泽东思想办事，在摸索和创造办中国式的国营农场的过程中，已经积累了丰富的经验。最近召开的全国农垦工作会议，在认真总结已往工作的基础上，进一步明确提出：办好国营农场的关键，是用毛泽东思想统帅国营农场的一切工作，从我国的实际情况出发，坚定地走自己的道路。我们相信，在这次会议以后，我国国营农场一定会办得更好，为国家的社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。
