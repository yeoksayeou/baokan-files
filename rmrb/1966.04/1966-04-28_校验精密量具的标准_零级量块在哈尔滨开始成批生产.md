Edition: 2

    The Grade Zero gauge blocks (also known as gauge blocks), known as the "king of measuring tools," have been successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Measuring & Cutting Tool Factory and are now in batch production.

    With the development of modern mechanical industries, especially cutting-edge science and technology, the requirements for the precision of machine parts are becoming increasingly high. If the measuring tools used to measure the dimensions of parts have errors, thousands of parts will be scrapped. The accuracy of gauge blocks can be divided into five grades, with the dimensions of the zero grade gauge blocks being the most accurate. They are the standard for calibrating various precision measuring tools, and are greatly needed by national and local metrological agencies, scientific research departments, and precision machinery manufacturing plants.

    Gauge block production has a history of over seventy years in foreign countries, but to date, only a few countries with relatively advanced industry and science and technology are able to produce zero grade gauge blocks.

    校验精密量具的标准——
    零级量块在哈尔滨开始成批生产
    被称为“量具之王”的零级量块（又叫块规）已经在哈尔滨量具刃具厂试制成功，并且开始成批生产。
    随着近代机械工业特别是尖端科学技术的发展，对机器零件的精确度要求越来越高。用来度量零件尺寸的量具有了误差，千万零件就会报废。量块的精度可以分为五级，以零级量块尺寸为最准。它是校验各种精密量具的标准，国家和地方的计量机关、科学研究部门和精密机械制造厂都很需要。
    在国外，量块生产已有七十多年历史，但到目前为止，能够生产零级量块的还只有少数工业和科学技术比较先进的国家。
