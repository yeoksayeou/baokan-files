    The collective creation of the Printmaking Department of the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts
    The Sanshan Brigade of Zhenhai County is an advanced banner for building a new socialist countryside in Zhejiang Province. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces the sea on one side. Before liberation, it was a remote and poor mountain village. The mountains were barren, the land was infertile, and disasters occurred year after year. The broad masses of peasants lived a tragic life.
    After liberation, the peasants of Sanshan turned themselves over. Holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, they adhered to taking class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key, and constantly waged resolute struggles against class enemies and various erroneous ideas. They relied closely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, they overcame three major natural disasters. In production, they vigorously carried out basic farmland water conservancy construction, actively engaged in afforestation, developed offshore fishing, and animal husbandry and sideline production. Over the past few years, agricultural production has continued to grow, the collective economy has continued to grow stronger, village-run enterprises have continued to develop, and the lives of commune members have continued to improve. They have now achieved the main targets stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" for grain, cotton, pigs, and other major indicators ahead of schedule, and a prosperous scene of comprehensive development in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries has emerged.
    Art workers in Zhejiang Province actively responded to the call of the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China on "striving to achieve the main targets of the 'National Agricultural Development Program' ahead of schedule or on schedule throughout the province," and went deep into the countryside to create art works reflecting this great struggle, effectively cooperating with political movements. The practice of art workers in Zhejiang Province, who closely cooperate with the current political struggle and promote the Party's principles and policies in a popular and vivid way, is worthy of promotion.

    自力更生创大业
    《实现四十条　建设新农村》木刻组画
    浙江美术学院版画系集体创作
    镇海县三山大队，是浙江省建设社会主义新农村的一面先进旗帜。那里三面环山，一面临海。解放前是个偏僻的穷山岙［ào傲］，山荒地薄，灾害连年，广大农民过着悲惨的生活。
    解放后，三山农民翻了身。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，不断同阶级敌人和各种错误思想作坚决斗争。他们紧紧依靠贫下中农，以自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，战胜了三次特大自然灾害。在生产中，大兴农田水利基本建设，积极造林、发展远海捕鱼和畜牧副业生产。几年来，农业生产不断增长，集体经济不断壮大，队办企业不断发展，社员生活不断改善，现已提前实现了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的粮、棉、猪等主要指标，出现了农林牧副渔全面发展的兴旺景象。
    浙江省的美术工作者，积极响应中共浙江省委关于“争取在全省范围内提前或如期实现‘全国农业发展纲要’的主要指标”的号召，纷纷深入农村，创作了反映这一伟大斗争的美术作品，有力地配合了政治运动。浙江省美术工作者这种密切配合当前政治斗争，通俗而形象地宣传党的方针政策的做法是值得提倡的。
    1　巨大鼓舞
    四十条，是个宝，干群同把规划订，
    光芒照耀三山岙，穷山恶水要改造。
    2　奋起台风
    规划执行第一年，支部带动众社员，
    不料台风降灾难，斗风斗雨斗老天。
    3　三路誓师
    三山人，斗志高，自力更生谋自救，
    大风大浪刮不倒，三路进军红旗飘。
    4　灾后夺粮
    农业大军夺秋粮，季节不误地不荒，
    千人奋战补种忙，重灾依旧粮满仓。
    5　雄军闯海
    二路远洋把鱼捞，海上英雄夺丰产，
    社员个个斗志高，闯出生产新门道。
    6　雪地修塘
    三路大军修海塘，加高加阔铸铁壁，
    扎营战斗志如钢，新堤更比旧堤强。
    7　制服旱魔
    战胜台风遭旱灾，车水上山斗旱魔，
    有志能把山移开，苦战夺得丰收来。
    8　大兴水利
    两次重灾教训深，治山治水造水库，
    改造自然树雄心，水清草绿放羊群。
    9　培育新苗
    三山果木四季春，科学实验搞得好，
    树下辛勤育新人，金柑茶叶满山青。
    10　阶级教育
    阶级教育不放松，毛泽东思想把路引，
    阶级斗争记心中，革命到底代代红。
    11　绿岙红心
    花结果，树成荫，农副产品运进城，
    大队规划已完成，支援国家一片心。
    12　英雄辈出
    斗山斗海斗天地，贫下中农多奇志，
    烈火之中炼真金，评功会上论群英。
    13　宏图再展
    红日高照东海边，革命红旗高高举，
    誓向大海夺良田，齐心阔步永向前。
