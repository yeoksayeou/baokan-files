    Solidly Carry Out This Year's Mass Swimming Activities
    The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission and eight other units have put forward opinions on carrying out swimming activities this year, requiring all localities to sum up experiences, strengthen leadership, and conscientiously grasp regular swimming activities at the grassroots level.
    Xinhua News Agency, 14th. The State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Red Cross Society of China, in a recent opinion to various localities on carrying out swimming activities this year, pointed out that it is necessary to continue to highlight politics, call on the vast numbers of cadres and the masses to "swim for the revolution," muster full energy, and solidly carry out mass swimming activities.
    This opinion was jointly put forward by the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Health, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Women's Federation, and the Red Cross Society of China.
    The opinion pointed out that last year's mass swimming activities started early, developed rapidly, involved a large number of people, and had significant results. The scale of development was unprecedented in previous years. The military and civilians across the country, especially young people, actively participated in swimming activities, rapidly forming a mass movement. This not only helped enhance the people's physical fitness but also played an important role in enhancing the vast masses' awareness of serving national defense.
    According to the current situation and the needs of the masses, this year's swimming activities will inevitably have new developments. All localities and units should conscientiously sum up experiences, strengthen leadership, and further improve the work of organizing mass swimming. First of all, it is necessary to raise the awareness of the vast masses about swimming activities so that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war and related swimming instructions penetrate the hearts of the people. Leaders at all levels must truly value and support the creation of a swimming craze. Furthermore, in the course of work, it is necessary to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, conduct in-depth education targeting people's living thoughts, and patiently and meticulously solve various ideological problems. Send ideological work to the door, to the home, to the water, to all aspects of society, and into people's hearts. In this way, swimming activities can be carried out persistently and perseveringly.
    The opinion mentioned that swimming is an activity with a wide scope, a large number of people, strong timing, and that requires certain conditions. The most fundamental way to resolve these contradictions is to mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and promote self-reliance at the grassroots level. For example, regarding the issue of swimming venues, the vast masses can be mobilized to fully utilize natural waters such as rivers, ponds, lakes, weirs, canals, and wastewater ponds to survey and select swimming venues or build simple swimming pools themselves. Regarding the issue of swimming coaches, it is advocated that those who are capable should be teachers, teach each other and learn from each other, establish swimming technical guidance stations, and cultivate small coaches at all levels. In terms of training methods, some localities have created effective rapid swimming teaching methods that combine land and water, combine shallow and deep water, and teach according to individual aptitude.
    The opinion also pointed out that the practice of grassroots self-reliance and simplicity should be promoted, and the policy of self-reliance and thrift in running sports should be implemented. Large-scale swimming activities such as crossing rivers are an effective way to mobilize the masses, but they require a great deal of organizational work and should be held less frequently and better. The main energy should be focused on solidly grasping regular grassroots activities so that most people learn to swim. Those with the conditions can engage in long-distance, multi-style, high-speed, armed swimming activities and advocate learning diving and treading water. In regular activities, attention should be paid to the combination of popularization and improvement. We must oppose simply pursuing the number of people going into the water and the scale of activities, neglecting practical results; and we must also oppose one-sidedly emphasizing formal postures, restricting the enthusiasm of the masses, and causing activities to remain limited to a few people.
    The nine units' opinion on carrying out swimming activities this year also emphasized that swimming is one of the main projects of mass sports activities in summer. Therefore, this activity must be unified under the leadership of the Party committee, with relevant organizations at all levels dividing responsibilities. Education departments, trade unions, Communist Youth League organizations, armed forces departments, and other units are respectively in charge of swimming activities for students, workers, farmers, officers and soldiers, and militiamen. It is necessary to strengthen the education of safety and rescue knowledge, safety measures must be thorough, the system must be implemented, forming everyone talking about safety, everyone managing safety, and someone who can rescue. Special attention should be paid to the safety and organization of swimming activities for children, holidays, decentralized operations, and street residents.
    The opinion finally stated that the swimming season is approaching, and all preparations must be made. Special agencies in various localities should be established as early as possible, continue to renovate and open up some new swimming venues, hold swimming knowledge lectures, conduct water rescue training, and cultivate a large number of guidance backbones, coaches, and rescue personnel, and compile publicity materials so that this year's swimming activities can develop more healthily.

    踏踏实实开展今年群众性游泳活动
    国家体委等九单位提出关于今年开展游泳活动的意见，要求各地总结经验，加强领导，认真抓好基层经常性游泳活动。
    新华社十四日讯　国家体委等九单位最近向各地提出关于今年开展游泳活动的意见中指出，必须继续突出政治，号召广大干部和群众“为革命而游泳”，鼓足干劲，踏踏实实地把群众性游泳活动开展起来。
    这个意见是由国家体委、解放军总参谋部、共青团中央、高教部、教育部、卫生部、全国总工会、全国妇联和中国红十字会等九单位联合提出的。
    意见中指出，去年的群众性游泳活动，抓得早，发展快，人数多，收效大，开展的规模是历年来所没有的。全国军民，尤其是青少年积极参加游泳活动，迅速形成群众运动，这不仅有利于增强人民体质，并且对广大群众增强为国防服务的观念起了重要的作用。
    根据当前形势和群众的需要，今年的游泳活动必将有新的发展，各地各单位应认真总结经验，加强领导，进一步做好组织群众游泳的工作。首先要提高广大群众对游泳活动的认识，使毛主席的人民战争思想和有关的游泳指示深入人心。各级领导要真正重视和支持，使游泳活动形成热潮。并且在工作当中，要活学活用毛主席著作，针对人们的活思想，深入地进行教育，耐心、细致地解决各种思想问题。把思想工作送上门，做到家，做到水上去，做到社会各方面去，做到人们的心里去。这样，游泳活动才能做到坚持不懈，持之以恒。
    意见中谈到，游泳是一项面广人多，时间性强，又必须具备一定条件的活动。解决这些矛盾，最根本的办法是发动群众，依靠群众，提倡各基层单位自办。例如，游泳场所问题，可以动员广大群众充分利用河、塘、湖、堰、水渠、废水池等天然水域，勘察选定游泳场所，或自己动手修建简易游泳池。游泳教练问题，提倡能者为师，互教互学，建立游泳技术辅导站，层层培养小教练。在训练方法上，有些地方创造水陆结合，深浅结合，因人施教等快速游泳教法，行之有效。
    意见中还指出，应该提倡基层自办，因陋就简的作法，贯彻自力更生，勤俭办体育的方针。横渡江河等大型游泳活动是有效地发动群众的一种方法，但需要做很大的组织工作，应当少办些，办好些。要把主要精力放在扎扎实实地抓基层经常性活动，使多数人学会游泳。有条件的，可以搞长距离、多姿式、快速度、武装泅渡活动和提倡学习潜水、踩水。经常性活动中，要注意普及和提高相结合。既反对单纯追求下水的人次、活动规模，忽视实效；又反对片面强调正规姿势，限制群众的积极性，使活动停留在少数人身上。
    九单位对今年开展游泳活动的意见中还强调指出，游泳是夏季群众体育活动的主要项目之一，因此，这一活动必须在党委统一领导下，由各级有关组织分工负责。教育部门、工会、共青团组织、武装部门等单位，分别主管学生、职工、农民、官兵和民兵的游泳活动。要加强安全和救护知识的教育，安全措施要周密，制度要落实，形成人人讲安全，人人管安全，有人会救护。特别要重视少年儿童、节假日、分散性作业和街道居民等游泳活动的安全工作和组织工作。
    意见中最后谈到，游泳季节即将到来，必须做好各项准备工作，各地专设机构应尽早建立，继续整修和开辟一些新的游泳场所，举办游泳知识讲座，进行水上救护训练，大量培养辅导骨干、教练和救护人员，编写宣传资料，使今年的游泳活动更加健康地发展。
