    China's Sugar Production Achieves Another Substantial Increase
    Nearly 20% increase compared to the previous sugar production season with the highest historical output, sugar supply to the market is now relatively sufficient.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 29th: In the 1965-1966 sugar production season, which is nearing its end, China's sugar production has increased by nearly 20% compared to the previous sugar production season with the highest historical output. As a result of two consecutive years of substantial sugar production increases, the supply of sugar on the Chinese market is now relatively sufficient.
    This sugar production season began last October, when sugarcane and sugar beet crops were harvested. Last year, China's sugarcane and sugar beet crops achieved historically unprecedented bumper harvests. This was due to the expansion of planting areas, and also because farmers promoted revolutionary enthusiasm and production enthusiasm, selected large quantities of improved varieties, and practiced intensive farming, thereby increasing yields per unit area. Despite the fact that some regions experienced floods and droughts last year, and Guangdong, China's main sugarcane producing area, was hit by a strong typhoon, the broad masses of farmers adhered to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, overcame natural disasters, and ensured the increased production of sugar crops.
    In the context of bumper harvests of sugar crops, the broad masses of workers in the sugar industry carried out technical innovation and technical revolution movements, reformed technological processes, transformed equipment, and fully exploited the potential of equipment. The processing capacity of old factories has generally improved, and the overall sugar recovery rate has also significantly improved. In this way, the state produced more sugar without increasing raw materials, equipment, or manpower. The quality of sugar has also improved significantly compared to the past. The quality of sugar supplied to rural areas has not only greatly improved, but also the variety has increased.
    During this half-year sugar production season, twenty-three mechanized sugar factories were newly built, expanded, completed, and put into production. The construction time of these sugar factories was shortened by about half compared to the past. Their timely commissioning increased the processing capacity of China's sugar industry by nearly 30%. At the same time, small-scale semi-mechanized sugar mills were also established last year in remote areas with inconvenient transportation, so that the small amounts of sugar crops scattered throughout China could also be promptly processed into sugar.

### 我国食糖又获大幅度增产  比历史上产糖最高的上一个制糖期增加将近两成，供应市场的食糖已比较充足

    我国食糖又获大幅度增产
    比历史上产糖最高的上一个制糖期增加将近两成，供应市场的食糖已比较充足
    新华社二十九日讯　在接近尾声的一九六五至一九六六年制糖季节里，我国食糖产量又比历史上产糖最高的上一个制糖期增加了将近两成。连续两年食糖大幅度增产的结果，我国市场上供应的食糖已经比较地充足了。
    这个制糖季节是从去年十月糖料作物甘蔗和甜菜收获的时候开始的。去年我国甘蔗和甜菜获得了历史上空前的大丰收，这是由于播种面积扩大了，同时，农民们发扬了革命积极性和生产积极性，大量选用了良种，并且精耕细作，提高了单位面积产量。尽管去年一些地区发生了水旱灾害，我国甘蔗主要产地广东遭到了强烈台风袭击。但是广大农民坚持了自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，战胜了自然灾害，保证了糖料作物的增产。
    在糖料作物大丰收的情况下，制糖工业广大职工开展了技术革新和技术革命运动，改革了工艺流程，改造了设备，充分发挥了设备的潜力。老厂的加工能力普遍提高了，糖分的总收回率也有了显著提高。这样，就使得国家在不增加原料、设备和人力的条件下，多产了食糖。食糖的质量也比以往有了显著的提高。供应农村的食糖，不但质量大有提高，而且品种也增多了。
    在延续半年的这个制糖季节里，新建扩建完成并投入了生产的机械化糖厂有二十三个。这些糖厂的建设时间比以往缩短了一半左右。它们的及时投产，使我国食糖工业的加工能力增加了将近百分之三十。同时，去年在交通不便的边远地区还建立了小型的半机榨糖厂，使我国分散在各地的小量的糖料作物也能及时榨制成糖。
