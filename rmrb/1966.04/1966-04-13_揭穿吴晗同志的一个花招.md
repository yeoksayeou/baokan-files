    Exposing a Trick of Comrade Wu Han
    Ke Wu
    Comrade Wu Han's *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is a poisonous weed that opposes the Party and socialism. However, in his "Self-Criticism Regarding *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*," in order to evade this political issue, he played a trick, saying: "Why not write about the struggle between two opposing classes, but instead write about the internal struggle of the ruling class? ...The unshakable principle that proletarian literature and art must serve current politics has been completely forgotten."
    Whether or not literary works can use the internal struggles of the historical ruling class as subject matter is not a problem in itself. Literary works should express conflicts, and can write about the contradictions between the enemy and us, as well as contradictions among the people. Works with historical themes should write about the contradictions between the people and the ruling class, and can also write about the internal contradictions of the ruling class. The problem lies in the political motives from which one proceeds, and the standpoint, viewpoint, and method used to write. Comrade Wu Han "examines" the matter with great seriousness, as if, according to the "unshakable principles" of proletarian literature and art, it is impossible to write about the internal struggles of the historical ruling class, and that he was only labeled with a political "hat" because he wrote about the internal struggles of the ruling class. Obviously, this is a counter-attack, a challenge to the Party and the people!
    When discussing the writing of *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, Comrade Wu Han once pointed out that the "typical character" of a character needs a "typical environment." So, what kind of typical environment does *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* write about? It writes about a "typical environment" that could not have occurred at that time. On the surface, it is based on the "internal contradictions" of the ruling class, but in reality, it is not the case at all. With Hai Rui, the "savior," representing the "oppressed, bullied, and wronged people" as one side, and Xu Jie as the main figure, encompassing almost all members of the ruling group, as the other side, the contradictions are extremely sharp, and both sides want to kill. In the end, Hai Rui, risking "death and the extermination of his clan," succeeded in killing, and he himself was finally stripped of his official hat. Look at how fierce this life-and-death struggle is! What kind of "typical environment" is this writing about for the "typical character" of what kind of person? Is this the "typical environment" needed to write about the historical Hai Rui? Absolutely not. It is only writing about today's fake Hai Rui, the "typical environment" needed to write about the "typical character" of today's opposition "heroes" who claim to "speak for the people."
    The problem with *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office* is fundamentally not about whether or not to write about the internal struggles of the historical feudal ruling class, but that Comrade Wu Han, standing on a reactionary position, using reactionary viewpoints and methods, used the pretext of writing about the internal contradictions of the ruling class to encourage and cheer on right-leaning opportunists, calling on them to make a comeback and attack the Party and socialism. This trick played by Comrade Wu Han precisely reveals that he is still continuing to adhere to a reactionary position.

    揭穿吴晗同志的一个花招
    牁梧
    吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》是一株反党反社会主义的大毒草。但他在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中，为了回避这个政治问题，耍了一个花招，说：“为什么不写两个对立阶级的斗争，而写统治阶级的内部斗争呢？……无产阶级的文学、艺术都必须为当前政治服务的不可动摇的原则，完全忘记了。”
    文艺作品能不能以历史上的统治阶级内部斗争为题材，这本来是不成问题的。文艺作品要表现矛盾冲突，可以写敌我矛盾，也可以写人民内部矛盾。以历史为题材的作品，应该写人民群众和统治阶级的矛盾，也可以写统治阶级的内部矛盾。问题在于从什么样的政治动机出发，用什么立场、观点和方法来写。吴晗同志煞有介事地“检查”，好象根据无产阶级文艺的“不可动摇的原则”，是不可以写历史上的统治阶级内部斗争，而他只是因为写了统治阶级的内部斗争，就被人扣上了政治“帽子”。显然，这是反戈一击，这是向党向人民挑战！
    吴晗同志在谈写作《海瑞罢官》的时候，曾经指出写人物的“典型性格”需要有“典型环境”。那末，《海瑞罢官》写的究竟是什么样的典型环境呢？它写的是一种在当时不可能发生的“典型环境”。从外表上看，它是取材于统治阶级“内部矛盾”的，实际上根本不是这么一回事。以海瑞为“救星”的“被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们”为一方，以徐阶为主几乎包括统治集团所有成员为另一方，矛盾非常尖锐，双方都要杀人，结果是海瑞冒着“丧身灭族”的危险杀成功了，自己也终于被摘去乌纱帽。请看这是一场多么激烈的生死斗争呵！这是写什么人的“典型性格”时需要的“典型环境”？难道这是写历史上的海瑞所需要的“典型环境”吗？根本不是。它只是写今天的假海瑞，写今天那种以“为民请命”自居的反对派“英雄”的“典型性格”所需要的“典型环境”。
    《海瑞罢官》的问题根本不在于是否写历史上封建统治阶级的内部斗争，而在于吴晗同志站在反动的立场上，用反动的观点和方法，借写统治阶级内部矛盾为名，给右倾机会主义分子鼓劲打气，号召他们卷土重来，向党向社会主义进攻。吴晗同志耍的这个花招，恰好揭露了他自己仍在继续坚持反动立场。
