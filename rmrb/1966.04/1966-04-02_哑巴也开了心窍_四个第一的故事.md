    If you go to Anshan Iron and Steel Company and ask about Comrade Pei Ying, people will tell you a lot about how he does ideological work. Here’s a story about how he helped the mute worker Wang Baoshan make progress.
    Pei Ying is the instructor of the sintering workshop at the Dashiqiao Magnesite Mine. He transferred to Anshan Iron and Steel from the military in 1964. At that time, there was a mute worker named Wang Baoshan in the sintering workshop who was a backward worker. Not long after Comrade Pei Ying arrived at the workshop, many cadres and workers reported to him that they simply had no way to deal with this mute. He thought, Chairman Mao teaches us to "mobilize all positive factors, unite all who can be united, and transform negative factors into positive factors as far as possible, to serve the great cause of building a socialist society." The mute Wang Baoshan is a negative factor in the workshop. Can he be transformed into a positive factor?
    Comrade Pei Ying relied on the cadres and the masses to learn that Wang Baoshan lived in Fushun before liberation and his father was a carpenter who lived in extreme poverty. In 1932, when Wang Baoshan was six years old, the Japanese invaders created the "Pingdingshan Massacre," and he watched his whole family being brutally murdered by enemy machine guns. Under the cover of his uncle, he and his younger brother escaped that night. After escaping, he lived with his aunt, whose family was also very poor. When Wang Baoshan was just ten years old, he began herding livestock for others. He was often hungry, poorly clothed, beaten and scolded. After growing up, he ran away and wandered around. After liberation, he came to the magnesite mine and joined the workforce. Wang Baoshan's work was good for the first few years after entering the factory. Later, due to long-term non-participation in political activities, he became contaminated with bourgeois bad habits and gradually changed. Every day he carried a load of water to "work," and as soon as he put down the buckets he was "off work." What to do about this? Pei Ying recalled that both the military and the factory had discipline, and wanted to use discipline to restrain him, so he told the attendance clerk to mark Wang Baoshan as absent if he left early. But after marking him absent for three days, Wang Baoshan went to the clinic and got three days' sick leave. The method of using discipline to restrain him failed. They studied how to control him economically. When paying wages, they first gave him thirty yuan and kept the remaining wages for him, but Wang Baoshan didn't agree. In less than three days, he wanted all the money. The method of economic control was also ineffective. These failures reminded Comrade Pei Ying of Chairman Mao's teaching that ideological and political work can only rely on persuasion, not coercion. The same applies to the mute. If you want to reform Wang Baoshan, you must first approach Wang Baoshan, care for Wang Baoshan, and understand Wang Baoshan.
    After three months of effort, Comrade Pei Ying learned about Wang Baoshan's daily life from the masses around him, and learned Wang Baoshan's set of gestures used to "speak". So he became more determined and took the opportunity to "talk" with Wang Baoshan and exchange ideas. Gradually, Wang Baoshan regarded Comrade Pei Ying as his friend, and he began to have a desire to improve. One day, after carrying water to work, he didn't leave immediately as usual, but swept the floor before leaving. This seems ordinary to others. But this happened to Wang Baoshan, and it was an extraordinary change. Comrade Pei Ying immediately seized this budding sign, supported it, and praised it. Wang Baoshan was praised and encouraged, and his enthusiasm was even greater. In addition to carrying water and sweeping the floor, he also cleaned the windows of the office. While Wang Baoshan was cleaning the windows, Comrade Pei Ying mobilized the masses to write big-character posters to welcome Wang Baoshan's transformation. Although Wang Baoshan was illiterate and didn't understand the full meaning of the big-character posters, he observed people's behavior and expressions based on his life experience, and saw his name written on the big-character posters, and felt very honored. He felt the glory and happiness of labor. He worked harder and harder.
    Wang Baoshan finally transformed. The relationship between Comrade Pei Ying and Wang Baoshan became more and more intimate. Comrade Pei Ying then conducted class education on him, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm his mind. One day, Comrade Pei Ying gestured to Wang Baoshan about his family history, Wang Baoshan was very excited when he "heard" it, and also gestured about his own experience. He cried as he gestured, so excited that he was sweating all over. Later, Comrade Pei Ying asked someone to draw a family history for him, so that he could recall and compare it with others, so that he and his comrades could regularly receive class education. Comrade Pei Ying also repeatedly practiced using gestures to express the content of the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to help Wang Baoshan understand the spirit of the article. Wang Baoshan raised his fist, meaning that he was determined to learn from Comrade Bethune. Later, when he introduced his learning experience to others, he gestured that before he studied the article "In Memory of Norman Bethune", his heart was very small, like it was growing under his armpit, but after studying, his heart became bigger and centered; before studying, he always took small steps when carrying water, and only carried two loads, but after studying, he took big steps when carrying water, and the number of times he carried water also increased.
    Wang Baoshan's consciousness was raised, and his transformation was even greater. Is it possible to relax the work slightly after this? No, it's not possible. Ideological work must be grasped at all times, class education must be carried out regularly, and Mao Zedong Thought must be studied and applied repeatedly. Comrade Pei Ying and the workshop cadres studied and sent people to take Wang Baoshan to visit the Fushun Martyrs Cemetery. Wang Baoshan remembered the relatives who were brutally murdered by the Japanese invaders, and lay on a grave, crying incessantly. Then, according to the clues they had learned, they helped Wang Baoshan find his younger brother Wang Weiqi, who had been separated for twenty-seven years. They sent Wang Baoshan to Jilin. The Jilin City Foreign Trade Bureau held a staff meeting to congratulate Wang Baoshan on the reunion of his brothers. When returning to Anshan on the train, Wang Baoshan's mood was still very excited. He couldn't sit or stand still. He had so much to say! But he couldn't say it, he could only take out Chairman Mao's works and look at them over and over again.
    One education after another, one encouragement after another, promoted Wang Baoshan's rapid transformation. Only a year has passed, and the current Wang Baoshan is completely different from the Wang Baoshan of a year ago. He made up for the union dues he hadn't paid for the past seven years. He abides by labor discipline in his work, and is active and willing to work hard. When carrying magnesia sand bags, others carry one bag, he carries three bags. On the bus, he gives up his seat to the elderly and women. Seeing that someone's hand is bleeding, he tears off his own handkerchief to bandage it. If there is a temporary shortage of people for pushing carts and materials, he steps forward and does it. Now he has become an activist in studying Mao Zedong Thought in the workshop; he gives reports in the workshop, deaf-mute school and some factories and mines of Anshan Iron and Steel, introducing his experience in studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought in a living way.

### 哑巴也开了心窍  四个第一的故事

    哑巴也开了心窍
    四个第一的故事
    你到鞍山钢铁公司，问起培英同志，人们便会告诉你很多关于他怎样做思想工作的事情。这里讲一个他怎样帮助哑巴工人王宝山进步的故事。
    培英同志是大石桥镁矿烧结车间的教导员，一九六四年由部队转业到鞍钢。当时烧结车间有个哑巴工人王宝山，是个落后工人。培英同志到车间不久，许多干部和工人都向他反映说，对这个哑巴简直没有办法。他想，毛主席教导我们，要“调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素，为建设社会主义社会这个伟大的事业服务。”哑巴王宝山是车间的消极因素，能不能把他转变为积极因素呢？
    培英同志依靠干部和群众，了解到王宝山解放前家住抚顺，父亲是个木匠，生活十分贫困。一九三二年王宝山六岁时，日本侵略者制造了“平顶山惨案”，他眼看全家在敌人机枪下惨遭杀害。他在叔父的掩护下，当天晚上和他小弟弟逃了出来，脱险后，住在姑姑家，姑姑家也很穷，王宝山刚满十岁，就给人家放牲口。吃不饱，穿不暖，挨打受骂。长大以后，他跑出来到处流浪。解放后，他来到镁矿，参加了工作。王宝山入厂后，头几年工作还不错。以后，由于长期不参加政治活动，沾染了资产阶级的恶习，渐渐变了。每天挑一担水“上班”，放下水桶就“下班”。这可怎么办呢？培英想起军队和工厂都有纪律，想用纪律约束他，便告诉考勤员，以后王宝山走了就画旷工。可是画了三天，王宝山就去卫生所要来三天病假条。用纪律约束的办法失败了。他们又研究从经济上控制他。发薪时，先给他三十元，把余下的工资代他保存下来，可是王宝山不干。不到三天，所有的钱都要走了，从经济上控制的办法也没有效。几次失败使培英同志想起了毛主席的教导，做政治思想工作只能靠说服，不能压服。哑巴也是如此。要想改造王宝山，必须先接近王宝山，关心王宝山，了解王宝山。
    经过三个月的努力，培英同志从王宝山周围的群众那里了解到王宝山的日常生活情况，学会了王宝山用来“说话”的一套手势。于是他更加坚定了信心，找机会就同王宝山“谈话”，交流思想。慢慢地王宝山把培英同志看成自己的朋友，他开始有了进步的要求。一天，他挑水上班以后，不象往日那样放下水桶就“下班”，而是扫完地才走。这在别的人看来是平常的事情。可是这件事情发生在王宝山身上却是个不平常的变化，培英同志马上抓住这个苗头，扶植它，表扬它。王宝山受到表扬，得到鼓舞，干劲更大了。除了挑水、扫地以外，他把办公室的玻璃也擦了。培英同志趁着王宝山擦玻璃的时候，就发动群众写大字报，欢迎王宝山转变。王宝山虽然不识字，不了解大字报的全部意思，但是，他根据生活的经验，观察着人们的举止、表情，看到大字报上写着自己的名字，感到很光荣。他感到了劳动的光荣和幸福。他越干越起劲了。
    王宝山终于有了转变。培英同志和王宝山的关系越来越亲切了。培英同志就对他进行阶级教育，用毛泽东思想把他的头脑武装起来。一天，培英同志向王宝山比划他的家史，王宝山“听”了非常激动，也比划了自己的遭遇。他一边比划一边哭，激动得全身冒汗。后来，培英同志请人给他画了一部家史，让他和别人一起回忆对比，使他和同志们经常地受到阶级教育。培英同志更反复练习用手势表达《纪念白求恩》这篇文章的内容，帮助王宝山领会文章的精神。王宝山举起拳头，意思说自己下决心向白求恩同志学习。以后，他向别人介绍学习心得时比划说，他学习《纪念白求恩》这篇文章以前，心很小，象长在胳肢窝底下，学习后心大了，放正中了；学习前挑水总是迈小步，挑两担就算了，学习后挑水迈大步，挑的次数也增多了。
    王宝山觉悟提高了，转变更大了。是不是以后的工作就可以稍稍放松一些呢？不，不能。思想工作必须时时抓紧，阶级教育必须经常进行，毛泽东思想必须反复学反复用。培英同志和车间干部研究，派人带王宝山到抚顺烈士墓去参观。王宝山想起了惨遭日本侵略者残杀的亲人，趴在一个坟上，痛哭不止。接着，他们又根据所了解的线索，帮助王宝山找到了分离二十七年的弟弟王维起。他们把王宝山送到吉林。吉林市外贸局召开了职工大会，祝贺王宝山兄弟团聚。回鞍山时，在火车上，王宝山的心情还是非常激动，他坐不稳、站不住，心里有多少话要说啊！可是他有话说不出来，只能不时地拿出毛主席著作翻来复去地看。
    一次又一次的教育，一次又一次的鼓励，促进着王宝山的迅速转变，时间仅隔一年，现在的王宝山截然不同于一年前的王宝山了。他补交了过去七年没交的工会会费。工作中遵守劳动纪律，积极肯干，扛镁砂口袋，别人扛一袋，他扛三袋。在汽车上，他给老人和妇女让座，看到别人手出血了，他撕下自己的手巾给包扎上，推车推料临时缺少个人，他走上前去就干。现在他已成为车间学习毛主席著作积极分子；在车间、聋哑学校和鞍钢部分厂矿作报告，介绍他活学活用毛主席著作的经验。
