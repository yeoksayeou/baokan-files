    The soaring military expenditure of the American aggression in Vietnam has strained the U.S. financial balance even further, causing inflation to worsen. Johnson's government is intensifying its attacks on the American people as a result. Johnson has already indicated that he will ask Congress this month for another $5 billion in tax increases to cope with the critical situation.

    Not long ago, Johnson was still boasting that "the economic cost of Vietnam has not placed an unbearable burden on our resources." He even pretended to ask, "Some people are shouting that we must make sacrifices. We would like to ask them: Who do they want to sacrifice?" However, hardly had the words left his mouth when the American people were once again forced to tighten their belts to make "new sacrifices" for the war of aggression in Vietnam.

    Saying all the nice things, doing all the bad things. Making sweet promises on one hand, and secretly setting traps on the other. Johnson's set of counter-revolutionary double-dealing tactics is not only used to deal with revolutionary people of various countries, but also to deal with the American people. As everyone knows, inflation and the devaluation of the dollar are disasters that the American ruling clique has imposed on the American people since the war. The broad masses of the American people have paid a heavy price for this. Now, Johnson is using the pretext of preventing price increases and stopping the devaluation of the dollar to decide to increase taxes by another $5 billion, further subjecting the American people to heavy tax burdens. The Johnson administration's use of deceptive tactics to place the burden of military spending in Vietnam on the American people exposes how uneasy and timid it is in implementing the unpopular policy of aggression in Vietnam.

    Of course, no matter how good Johnson is at playing tricks, he cannot cover up the ironclad fact that the American ruling authorities are intensifying their attacks on the American people in order to cope with the war of aggression in Vietnam. Even as Johnson boasted that America's wealth was "more than enough" to cope with the war in Vietnam, the consumption taxes on automobiles and telephones in the United States were increased. At the same time, at Johnson's suggestion, the U.S. Congress has passed an "Accelerated Tax Collection Act": collecting up to $6 billion in income taxes from the American people in advance over two years. In addition to this set of Johnson's "fiscal wizardry" (as U.S. *Newsweek* put it), which has "the reality of tax increases without the name of tax increases," state and local taxes in the United States have also increased by nearly 10 percent compared to a year ago. All of this shows that as long as Johnson continues to walk down the path of the war of aggression in Vietnam, the disasters of the American people will inevitably deepen day by day.

    At the beginning of this year, Johnson filed with the U.S. Congress: "If the situation in Southeast Asia develops to the point where additional funds are needed, I will not hesitate to request the necessary funds." Therefore, Johnson's $5 billion tax increase is only the beginning. In this way, the contradictions between the American ruling clique and the American people, and the American people's movement against the war of aggression in Vietnam, will inevitably develop further in the future, making the Johnson administration's situation increasingly unfavorable.

    约翰逊加紧向美国人民进攻
    史元
    美国侵越军费的直线上升，使美国财政收支更加捉襟见肘，通货膨胀益趋严重，约翰逊政府向美国人民的进攻随着也加紧了一步。约翰逊已经表示，他将在这个月要求国会再增税五十亿美元来应付危急局面。
    不久前，约翰逊还侈谈什么“为越南付出的经济上的代价并没有使我们的资源遭到不能忍受的重担”，他甚至还装模作样地表示：“有人叫喊说，我们必须作出牺牲。我们倒要问问他们：他们要牺牲谁？”但是，言犹在耳，美国人民已经再次被迫勒紧腰带，来为侵越战争作出“新的牺牲”了。
    好话说尽，坏事做绝。一面作出甜蜜的诺言，一面又在暗中下绊子。约翰逊的这套反革命两手，不但用来对付各国革命人民，而且也用来对付美国人民。大家知道，通货膨胀和美元贬值，这本是战后美国统治集团强加在美国人民头上的一场灾难。美国广大人民因此付出了重大牺牲。现在约翰逊反而以所谓防止物价上涨和制止美元贬值为名，决定再增税五十亿美元，使美国人民进一步遭受重税盘剥。约翰逊政府采用欺骗手法来把侵越军费的重担压在美国人民头上，暴露了它在执行不得人心的侵越政策上是何等心虚胆怯。
    当然，不管约翰逊怎样善于玩弄江湖骗术，他也无法掩盖美国统治当局为应付侵越战争，加紧进攻美国人民的铁的事实。就在约翰逊大吹其美国的财富应付侵越战争“绰绰有余”声中，美国的汽车和电话消费税增加了。同时，在约翰逊的建议下，美国国会已经通过一项“加紧征税法案”：两年内向美国人民提前征收多达六十亿美元的所得税。除了这套“无增税之名，而有增税之实”的约翰逊的“财政巫术”（美国《新闻周刊》语）以外，美国州和地方的赋税也比一年前增加近百分之十。所有这些都表明，只要约翰逊继续沿着侵越战争的道路走下去，美国人民的灾难就必将日益深重。
    约翰逊在今年年初就向美国国会备案说：“如果东南亚的事态发展得需要额外的经费，我将毫不犹豫地要求必需的款项”，因此，约翰逊的五十亿美元增税，只不过是一个开始。这样，美国统治集团同美国人民之间的矛盾，美国人民反对侵越战争的运动，今后也必将更加发展，使约翰逊政府的处境日益不妙。
