    According to a dispatch from Tirana on the 14th by Xinhua News Agency reporter: The commanders and fighters of the Albanian Armed Forces warmly support the revolutionary measures proposed in the recent open letter from the Central Committee of the Labor Party, guaranteeing to make full preparations politically, ideologically, organizationally, and militarily to defend the security of the motherland and promote the country's socialist construction.

    Under the call of the Labor Party and the leadership organs of the People's Army, all personnel of the armed forces have universally launched the "Model Company" movement. The Ministry of Defense has stipulated four main conditions for obtaining the title of "Model Company." These conditions are: (1) Good political and ideological work; (2) Good military and technical training; (3) Good care for the lives of the people and self-sufficiency in grain, meat, and vegetables; (4) Good completion of tasks with revolutionary working methods and work style. The first condition is the primary condition for obtaining the title of "Model Company." In addition, the entire army has also launched movements such as "Model Squads," "One Helps One," and "Model Youth Organizations." Inspired by the various revolutionary measures proposed by the Party Central Committee, all personnel of the armed forces are diligently practicing close combat, hand-to-hand combat, and night combat skills. Many units have achieved excellent results in military training and organizational discipline.

    The Albanian Labor Party and the government issued an appeal on October 25 last year, calling on all military personnel to vigorously engage in agricultural production according to local conditions, strive for self-sufficiency in agricultural and livestock products, and reduce state expenditures. To this end, all personnel of the armed forces have put forward the goal of achieving complete self-sufficiency in grain, meat, and vegetables for the entire army during the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970), and have launched a vigorous production movement. The entire army plans to reclaim 25,000 to 30,000 hectares of new land (each hectare equals 15 mu) during the Five-Year Plan period, and strive to reclaim 5,000 hectares of new land this year and plant 1,300 hectares of potatoes. In the production movement, the broad masses of commanders and fighters carried forward the spirit of hard work and vigorous effort, transforming barren mountains and ridges, river滩 areas, and scattered land near military barracks into farmland. According to statistics, from November last year to February this year, the entire army reclaimed a total of 1,600 hectares of new land. Up to now, they have planted 630 hectares of potatoes, exceeding the original plan by 80 hectares.

    Many cadres of the armed forces have also responded to the call of the Party and the government to go deep into the grassroots and support industrial and agricultural production, actively and enthusiastically taking on new jobs.

    Currently, the commanders and fighters of the Albanian Armed Forces are continuing to implement the various measures taken by the Party Central Committee to further revolutionize and modernize the army, maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, and make contributions to the country's national defense and socialist construction.

    阿尔巴尼亚军队贯彻进一步革命化措施
    普遍开展“模范连队”运动和轰轰烈烈的生产运动
    据新华社地拉那十四日电  本社记者报道：阿尔巴尼亚武装部队的指战员热烈拥护劳动党中央最近的公开信提出的革命化措施，保证要在政治、思想、组织和军事上做好全面准备，以保卫祖国的安全和推进国家的社会主义建设事业。
    在劳动党和人民军领导机关的号召下，武装部队的全体人员普遍开展了“模范连队”运动。国防部订出了获得“模范连队”称号的四个主要条件，这些条件是：（一）政治思想工作好；（二）军事技术训练好；（三）关心人的生活和粮食、肉类、蔬菜自给自足好；（四）用革命的工作方法和工作作风完成任务好。其中第一个条件是获得“模范连队”称号的首要条件。此外，全军还开展了“模范分队”、“一帮一”、“模范青年组织”等运动。武装部队的全体人员在党中央提出的各项革命化措施的鼓舞下，苦练近战、肉搏战和夜战本领。许多部队在军事训练和组织纪律等方面都取得了优秀成绩。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府在去年十月二十五日发表呼吁书，号召全体军人因地制宜地大办农业生产，争取农畜产品自给，以减少国家开支。武装部队的全体人员为此提出了在第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○年）期间做到全军粮食、肉类和蔬菜全部自给的奋斗目标，并且展开了轰轰烈烈的生产运动。全军计划在五年计划期间开垦新地二万五千至三万公顷（每公顷合十五市亩），争取在今年开垦新地五千公顷，栽种土豆一千三百公顷。广大指战员在生产运动中发扬苦干、猛干的精神，把荒山秃岭、河滩地带以及部队营房附近的零星土地变成了农田。据统计，从去年十一月到今年二月，全军共开垦新地一千六百公顷。到目前为止，他们已种下土豆六百三十公顷，比原定计划多种八十公顷。
    许多武装部队的干部还响应党和政府深入基层、支援工农业生产的号召，积极热情地走上新的工作岗位。
    现在，阿尔巴尼亚武装部队指战员正在继续贯彻党中央为使军队进一步革命化和现代化而采取的各项措施，保持高度的革命警惕性，以便为祖国的国防和社会主义建设作出贡献。（附图片）
