    Central Treaty Organization Ministerial Council Opens in Ankara
    Turkish Students Continue Anti-American Demonstrations
    [Xinhua News Agency, Ankara, 21st] Following anti-American demonstrations on the 19th, Turkish students, undeterred by police suppression, staged another demonstration in the capital, Ankara, on the 20th to protest against American interventionist policies and the activities of U.S. Secretary of State Rusk in Turkey.
    Rusk arrived in Turkey on the 19th to attend the Central Treaty Organization Ministerial Council meeting. The meeting opened in Ankara on the morning of the 20th.
    According to reports, as Rusk drove to the Turkish Officers' Club after attending the opening ceremony to have lunch with Turkish Prime Minister Demirel, two hundred Turkish students demonstrated in front of the club and jeered at Rusk. Turkish authorities dispatched police to disperse the demonstrating students. Several hours later, the students demonstrated again in front of the United States Information Service. Demonstrating students fought with police who came to suppress them. In the evening, students again held anti-American demonstrations outside the meeting hall of the Central Treaty Organization Ministerial Council. Turkish authorities again dispatched police to beat the demonstrating students with nightsticks.

    中央条约组织部长理事会议在安卡拉开场
    土耳其学生继续反美示威
    据新华社二十一日讯　安卡拉消息：继十九日举行反美示威之后，土耳其学生不顾警察的镇压，二十日再次在首都安卡拉举行示威，抗议美国的干涉政策和美国国务卿腊斯克到土耳其活动。
    腊斯克是十九日到达土耳其参加中央条约组织部长理事会会议的。会议已于二十日上午在安卡拉开幕。
    据报道，当腊斯克参加会议开幕式后驱车到达土耳其军官俱乐部以便同土耳其总理德米雷尔共进午餐时，二百名土耳其学生在俱乐部前举行示威，并对腊斯克发出嘲笑声。土耳其当局出动警察驱散示威学生。几小时以后，学生们又到美国新闻处前举行示威。示威学生同前来镇压的警察进行搏斗。晚上，学生们又到中央条约组织部长理事会会议厅外面举行反美示威。土耳其当局再次出动警察用夜间警棍殴打示威学生。
