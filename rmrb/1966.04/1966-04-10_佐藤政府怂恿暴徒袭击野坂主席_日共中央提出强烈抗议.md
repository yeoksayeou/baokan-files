    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 9th. The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) submitted a letter of protest to Japanese Prime Minister Sato on April 8th, strongly protesting the Sato government's incitement of thugs from right-wing groups to attack Chairman Sanzo Nosaka.
    It is reported that on the evening of April 7th, Sanzo Nosaka, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, attended a rally held at the Tokyo Metropolitan Hibiya Open-Air Concert Hall to support Torazo Ninagawa's campaign for Governor of Kyoto Prefecture. After Chairman Nosaka finished speaking to nearly ten thousand citizens, including young people and women, and was about to leave the venue, a group of thugs from the right-wing group "Patriotic Corps" (護国団), who had ambushed outside the venue wearing helmets, suddenly attacked Chairman Nosaka and Torazo Ninagawa. However, this group of thugs was immediately stopped by the Communist Party members and audience present. At 10:30 p.m. that night, this group of thugs rushed to Chairman Nosaka's residence, demanding to "meet" with Chairman Nosaka. Prior to this, thugs from right-wing groups had rushed to the residence of Sasaki Kozo, Chairman of the Socialist Party, who was visiting Kyoto that afternoon, and made a scene.
    The JCP Central Committee's letter of protest pointed out that this was a planned act of violence by the Japanese reactionaries to undermine the Kyoto gubernatorial election.
    The protest letter stated that this incident is not only a despicable attack and serious provocation against the people of Kyoto Prefecture who are striving to establish a democratic government, but also once again exposes the true face of the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Sato cabinet in promoting war and aggressive militarist politics. The protest letter demanded that the Sato cabinet and the Liberal Democratic Party assume political responsibility for the right-wing violent groups causing this incident, and demanded that the violent groups be severely punished.
    It is reported that as early as November 13, 1963, when Chairman Nosaka delivered a speech at a Japanese Communist Party rally in Osaka, the right-wing violent group "Patriotic Corps" (護国団) had plotted to assassinate Chairman Nosaka in a failed attempt.

    佐藤政府怂恿暴徒袭击野坂主席
    日共中央提出强烈抗议
    新华社东京九日电　日本共产党中央委员会八日向日本首相佐藤递交一份抗议书，强烈抗议佐藤政府怂恿右翼团体的暴徒袭击野坂参三主席。
    据报道，日本共产党中央委员会主席野坂参三七日晚间出席了在东京都市圆山公园音乐堂举行的演讲会，声援蜷川虎三竞选京都府知事。野坂主席对将近一万名青年、妇女等市民讲完话，刚要走出会场时，一群头戴钢盔埋伏在场外的右翼团体“护国团”的暴徒，突然向野坂主席和蜷川虎三袭来。但是，这群暴徒立即遭到在场的共产党员和听众们的制止。当天晚上十点半，这群暴徒又冲到野坂主席的住处，强要“会见”野坂主席。在这以前，右翼团体的暴徒曾在当天下午冲到正在京都访问的社会党委员长佐佐木更三的住处胡闹。
    日共中央的抗议书指出，这是日本反动派有计划地破坏京都府知事选举的暴行。
    抗议书说，这次事件不仅是对争取建立民主政府的京都府人民的卑鄙的攻击和严重挑衅，而且再一次暴露了美日反动派和佐藤内阁推行战争与侵略的军国主义政治的真面目。抗议书要求佐藤内阁和自由民主党对右翼暴力团制造这次事件担负政治责任，并且要求严惩暴力团。
    据报道，早在一九六三年十一月十三日，野坂主席在大阪市举行的日本共产党演讲会上演说时，曾经发生过右翼暴力团“护国团”阴谋刺杀野坂主席未遂的事件。
