    Commemorating the Centenary of the Birth of Albania's Famous Poet Çajupi
    Capital Literary and Art Circles Hold Gathering
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 17)　The capital's literary and art circles held a gathering this afternoon at the auditorium of Peking University to commemorate the centenary of the birth of Albanian famous poet Anton Zako Çajupi.
    Liu Baiyu, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Writers Association and Vice President of the China-Albania Friendship Association, presided over the memorial meeting. Feng Zhi, a member of the Chinese Writers Association Council and a poet, gave a report on Çajupi's life at the memorial meeting.
    In his report, Feng Zhi said that Çajupi was an outstanding poet of the Albanian national revival period and a prominent representative of Albania's militant, revolutionary literary tradition. He occupies an important position in the history of Albanian poetry and literature. His glorious name has far surpassed the borders of Albania, and his works are widely read by Chinese readers.
    Feng Zhi said that a full century has passed since the birth of Anton Zako Çajupi. In Albania, this century has been a very great period. Thousands of patriotic heroes in Albania expelled the Turks, repelled the Serbians and Greeks, and finally, under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, defeated the fascist armies of Italy and Germany, and established a socialist state. At present, Albania is advancing along the glorious road of comprehensively building a socialist society and resolutely opposing imperialism and revisionism, and the new reality has long surpassed Çajupi's hopes. However, due to Çajupi's past contributions to the people of the motherland in the struggle, he is still respected by the heroic Albanian people, and his poems continue to play an inspiring role.
    Feng Zhi said that today, as this militant friendship between our two parties and two peoples is being strengthened on the basis of the principles of Marxism-Leninism, and as our two parties and two peoples are joining hands and fighting shoulder to shoulder with imperialism headed by US imperialism and modern revisionism, and constantly achieving victories, commemorating the outstanding poet of the fraternal country adds to our intimate feelings and symbolizes that our two countries will further strengthen literary exchanges.
    Among those who attended the memorial meeting were Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Wei Jiangong, Vice President of Peking University, and poets Lin Lin and Chen Canyun, etc.
    Vasil Nathanaili, the Albanian Ambassador to China, and diplomatic officials of the embassy were invited to attend the memorial meeting. Albanian comrades in Beijing were also invited to attend the memorial meeting.

    纪念阿尔巴尼亚著名诗人恰佑比诞生一百周年
    首都文艺界举行集会
    据新华社十七日讯　首都文艺界今天下午在北京大学礼堂集会，纪念阿尔巴尼亚著名诗人安东·扎柯—恰佑比诞生一百周年。
    中国作家协会副主席、中国阿尔巴尼亚友好协会副会长刘白羽主持纪念会。中国作家协会理事、诗人冯至在纪念会上作了关于恰佑比生平的报告。
    冯至在报告中说，恰佑比是阿尔巴尼亚民族复兴时期的杰出的诗人，是阿尔巴尼亚战斗的、革命的文学传统的卓越代表。他在阿尔巴尼亚的诗歌和文学的发展史上占有重要的位置。他的光辉的名字已经远远超越了阿尔巴尼亚的国境，他的作品为中国广大的读者所传诵。
    冯至说，自安东·扎柯—恰佑比诞生起，整整一百年过去了，在阿尔巴尼亚，这一百年是一个十分伟大的时期。阿尔巴尼亚的千千万万爱国英雄驱逐了土耳其人，打退了塞尔维亚和希腊人，最后，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志的领导之下，打败了意大利和德国法西斯的军队，建立起了社会主义的国家。目前，阿尔巴尼亚正在沿着全面建设社会主义社会，坚决反对帝国主义和修正主义的光荣道路前进，新的现实早已经远远超过了恰佑比的希望。但是，由于恰佑比过去在斗争中对祖国人民的贡献，他至今仍然受着英勇的阿尔巴尼亚人民的尊敬，他的诗歌也继续在发挥着振奋人心的作用。
    冯至说，今天，当我们两党、两国人民之间的这种战斗友谊在马克思列宁主义的原则基础上愈益加强的时候，在我们两党、两国人民手携手、肩并肩同以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和现代修正主义进行坚决斗争，并不断取得胜利的时候，来纪念兄弟之邦的杰出诗人，就更为我们增加了亲密的感情，象征着我们两国在文学交流方面，也将更进一步地加强。
    参加纪念会的有对外文协会长楚图南，北京大学副校长魏建功，以及诗人林林、陈残云等。
    应邀参加纪念会的，还有阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使瓦西里·纳塔奈利和使馆外交官员。在北京的阿尔巴尼亚同志也应邀参加了纪念会。
