    New Equipment for Mine Construction
    Concrete Sprayer Successfully Trial-Produced
    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: A new piece of equipment for mine tunnel construction – the concrete sprayer – has recently been successfully trial-produced through the joint efforts of the Building Research Institute of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry and the Fourth Tunnel Company of the Third Metallurgical Construction Company, among others.
    Ores are generally buried underground. To extract them, mines have to be constructed and tunnels have to be excavated in the underground rocks. At present, the permanent lining of mine tunnels in our country mostly adopts on-site cast-in-place concrete, prefabricated concrete block masonry, or prefabricated reinforced concrete supports. The disadvantages of these methods are: complex construction, labor-intensive and material-consuming, hindering the overall mechanization of mine tunnel construction. Consequently, the construction speed of tunnel projects cannot be improved quickly.
    After adopting the newly made concrete sprayer, this situation can be changed. This sprayer uses compressed air as power and can spray concrete at high speed to the required locations. The sprayed concrete can be well compacted due to the impact force. Its strength is half to one times higher than concrete of the same mix ratio, and it also has the characteristics of rapid setting, strong adhesion to the sprayed surrounding rock surface, and good impermeability.
    This new type of sprayed concrete equipment has been used in the Anshan Iron and Steel Company’s Gongchangling Iron Mine and other projects, with good results. Using this method for underground tunnel lining projects can save all the wood used for formwork and 40% to 50% of concrete, reduce labor by one-half to two-thirds, accelerate the speed by 2.5 to 3.4 times, and reduce costs by about 50%. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has formally adopted it.

    矿山施工的新设备
    混凝土喷射机试制成功
    新华社讯　矿山井巷工程施工的新设备——混凝土喷射机，最近由冶金工业部建筑研究院和第三冶金建设公司第四井巷公司等单位共同试验成功。
    矿石一般都是埋藏在地下，要把矿石开采出来就得建设一座座矿井，并且在地下岩石当中开拓出一条条巷道。目前，我国矿山井巷工程的永久衬砌，都是采用现场整体捣制混凝土、预制混凝土块砌筑或预制钢筋混凝土支架等，其缺点是：施工复杂，费工费料，阻碍矿山井巷施工的全盘机械化，因而，井巷工程的建设速度不能很快提高。
    采用新制成的混凝土喷射机之后，就可以改变这种状况。这种喷射机用压缩空气作动力，可以把混凝土高速度喷射到需要的地方。喷出的混凝土由于冲击力的作用能够很好地捣实，它比同样配合比的混凝土强度高半倍到一倍，并且还有凝固快与喷筑的围岩表面粘结力强、不透水性好的特点。
    这种喷射混凝土的新设备，经过在鞍钢弓长岭铁矿和其他工程使用，效果良好。使用这种方法进行地下井巷的衬砌工程，可以节约全部制模板用的木材和百分之四十到五十的混凝土，少用劳动力二分之一到三分之二，加快速度二点五到三点四倍，降低成本百分之五十左右。目前，冶金工业部已正式采用。
