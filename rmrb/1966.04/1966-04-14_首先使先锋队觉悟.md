    First Make the Vanguard Conscious
    The Party branch of the Dongshizigou Brigade attaches importance to Party building, constantly educates Party members, and makes them forever revolutionary. The class consciousness of all Party members has gradually increased. They play an exemplary role in various tasks, leading the broad masses of commune members to improve production.
    Communist Party members are the advanced fighters of the working class. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "As long as our Communist Party ranks are neat, our steps are consistent, our soldiers are elite soldiers, and our weapons are good weapons, then any powerful enemy can be defeated by us." Mao Zedong Thought is our most powerful weapon for promoting class struggle, the struggle for production, and scientific experimentation. Party members armed with Mao Zedong Thought are elite soldiers. If this elite force uses Mao Zedong Thought to carry out the three great revolutionary struggles, it will be invincible.
    The Party branch of the Dongshizigou Brigade recognizes that, to do all work well, the important thing is to first make the vanguard conscious. Only when all Party members are mobilized, giving full play to their initiative and creativity, can the branch play its role as a fighting fortress.
    To make the vanguard conscious and truly play the role of the vanguard, the branch must constantly educate Party members with Mao Zedong Thought. When Party members recognize that they are advanced fighters of the working class, they will demand high standards of themselves. Some local Party branches lack education for Party members, and naturally cannot give good play to the exemplary role of Party members.
    When carrying out ideological education, the Party branch should also pay constant attention to carrying out criticism and self-criticism. It is necessary to educate Party members to use Mao Zedong Thought to compare and examine their own thoughts and actions, to use the "arrow" of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot the "target" of their own ideological problems, to correct their own shortcomings and errors in their thoughts and actions, and to promote themselves to better transform their subjective world, so as to better transform the objective world.
    Party members should become role models for the masses, and branch committee members should become role models for Party members. Branch committee members are democratically elected by Party members, who trust and love them. Their actions have the most direct and profound influence on all Party members. Branch committee members should understand this and consciously act as role models for Party members. The superior leading organs of grassroots branches, the commune Party committee and even the county Party committee, should take various measures to grasp the education of all Party members, especially the education of branch committee members of grassroots Party organizations, so that they can fully play their role as role models.

    首先使先锋队觉悟
    东狮子沟大队党支部，重视党的建设，经常教育党员，永远做革命派。全体党员阶级觉悟逐步提高，在各项工作中发挥模范作用，带动广大社员，把生产搞得更好。
    共产党员是工人阶级的先进战士。毛泽东同志说，“只要我们共产党的队伍是整齐的，步调是一致的，兵是精兵，武器是好武器，那末，任何强大的敌人都是能被我们打倒的。”毛泽东思想是我们推进阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验的最有力的武器。用毛泽东思想武装起来的党员是精兵，这支精兵运用毛泽东思想，开展三大革命斗争，就会无往而不胜。
    东狮子沟大队党支部认识到，要想做好一切工作，重要的是首先要使先锋队觉悟。只有所有的党员都动起来，充分发挥主动性、创造性，才能发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用。
    要使先锋队觉悟，真正起到先锋队的作用，支部必须经常用毛泽东思想对党员进行教育。党员认识到自己是工人阶级的先进战士，那就会用高标准要求自己。有些地方的党支部对党员缺乏教育，自然就不能够很好地发挥党员的先锋模范作用。
    党支部在进行思想教育的时候，还要经常注意开展批评和自我批评。要教育党员用毛泽东思想对照、检查自己的思想和行动，用毛泽东思想之“矢”，射自己的思想问题之“的”，改正自己的思想、行动中的缺点和错误，促进自己更好地去改造主观世界，从而更好地去改造客观世界。
    党员要成为群众的榜样，支部委员要成为党员的榜样。支部委员是党员民主选举出来的，党员信任他们，爱戴他们。他们的行动，对全体党员有着最直接最深切的影响。支部委员应该懂得这一点，自觉地作为党员的榜样。基层支部的上级领导机关，公社党委以至县委，应该采取各种措施，抓紧对全体党员的教育，首先是对基层党组织的支部委员的教育，使他们能充分发挥榜样的作用。
