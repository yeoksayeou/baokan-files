    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    The Party committee system is an important system of the Party for guaranteeing collective leadership and preventing individual monopoly.
                                  "On Perfecting the Party Committee System"
      Put the problems on the table. … Don't gossip behind people's backs. If there are problems, hold a meeting, put them on the table for discussion, stipulate a few points, and the problems will be solved.
                                  "Methods of Work of Party Committees"

    毛主席语录
    党委制是保证集体领导、防止个人包办的党的重要制度。
                                  《关于健全党委制》
      要把问题摆到桌面上来。……不要在背后议论。有了问题就开会，摆到桌面上来讨论，规定它几条，问题就解决了。
                                  《党委会的工作方法》
