    (Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, 17th) The newly built Bilin Sugar Factory in Burma has recently been completed and officially put into production. The first batch of sugar is already on sale in the market.
    This sugar factory is one of the efforts made by the Burmese government to solve the problem of self-sufficiency in sugar. Since independence, sugar production in Burma has developed, but it still cannot meet the needs of the market, and a large amount of foreign exchange has to be spent every year to import sugar from abroad.
    The Bilin Sugar Factory was built with Chinese assistance. Construction began on March 8 last year and was completed at the end of March this year. During the construction period, more than 2,000 Burmese workers and technicians, with the help of Chinese experts, made active efforts, so the entire project took only one year and one month, completing it three months ahead of schedule. Burmese friends praised this new sugar factory as "another flower of China-Burma friendship."

    缅甸比林糖厂建成并投入生产
    缅甸朋友们称赞新糖厂是中缅友谊的新花朵
    据新华社仰光十七日电　缅甸新建的比林糖厂已在最近建成并正式投入生产，第一批食糖已在市场上出售。
    这座糖厂是缅甸政府为了解决食糖自给自足所作的努力之一。独立以后，缅甸食糖生产有了发展，但仍不能满足市场的需要，每年要花外汇从国外进口大量的食糖。
    比林糖厂是在中国的帮助下兴建的，去年三月八日开始施工，今年三月底完工。在施工期间，两千多名缅甸工人和技术人员在中国专家的帮助下进行了积极的努力，因而全部工程只用了一年零一个月的时间，比原定计划提前三个月完成。缅甸朋友们称赞这座新糖厂是“中缅友谊的又一个花朵”。
