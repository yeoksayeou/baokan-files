    Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd—Huang Wanli, head of the South Vietnam Patriotic Democratic Journalists Association delegation, said in his speech at the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 21st, that the victory of the anti-American struggle of the military and civilians in South Vietnam shows that people's war is invincible. The South Vietnamese people are determined to hold their guns firmly and bury the American aggressors and their running dogs.

    In his speech, Huang Wanli exposed the "peace negotiation" fraud perpetrated by Johnson. Huang Wanli said that the root cause of the war in South Vietnam and the danger of its expansion stem from the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the issue that must be resolved in South Vietnam at present is: U.S. imperialism must withdraw all U.S. troops, military personnel, and various weapons from South Vietnam, abolish its U.S. military bases in South Vietnam, abolish the military alliance it concluded with South Vietnam, stop implementing its policy of aggression against South Vietnam, and let the Vietnamese people solve the problems of South Vietnam themselves.

    Huang Wanli said that the South Vietnamese Patriotic Democratic Journalists believe that under the current situation in Indonesia, it is absolutely necessary for the Asian-African Journalists Association to temporarily move its headquarters from Jakarta, and the South Vietnamese Patriotic Democratic Journalists Association fully supports this decision.

    In his speech, Huang Wanli strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for intensifying its war of aggression in South Vietnam. He said that the number of U.S. troops in South Vietnam has now increased to 240,000. Johnson also intends to increase the number of U.S. troops by hundreds of thousands. It is also colluding with its lackeys in South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines to send troops and technicians to South Vietnam to help it expand its war of aggression.

    He said that U.S. imperialism is implementing a policy of kill all, burn all, destroy all in South Vietnam, committing monstrous crimes. In the past eleven years and more, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs have massacred more than 170,000 of our compatriots, injured nearly 800,000 people and crippled them due to interrogation and torture, and imprisoned more than 400,000 people. In addition, millions of people have been forcibly concentrated in "strategic hamlets." For more than a year, U.S. imperialism has intensified its incredibly brutal military "sweeps," using artillery, airplanes, and even B-52 strategic aircraft to bomb areas one by one, and using chemical poisons and gases as means of war on an increasingly larger scale.

    Huang Wanli emphasized that the various crimes of U.S. imperialism fully expose its extremely brutal nature, indicating that the closer U.S. imperialism gets to its death, the more frantic and barbaric it becomes. He also condemned U.S. imperialism for expanding its aggression against North Vietnam, expanding the war in Laos, and constantly threatening and provoking Cambodia. He said that this proves that the American aggressors are not only the most dangerous and vicious enemies of the Vietnamese people, but also the number one enemy of peace, national independence, democracy, and social progress for the countries of Asia, Africa, and the world.

    Huang Wanli condemned U.S. imperialism for constantly playing "peace" tricks. He said that a wolf in sheep's clothing is still a wolf. How can Johnson's clamorous voice of "peace" cover up the deafening gunfire of the United States in South Vietnam? The actual situation in South Vietnam fully proves that for U.S. imperialism, talking about "peace" is to cover up its war actions. The more it talks about "peace," the more it expands the war. Talking about "unconditional discussions" is to ask us to accept its conditions. These conditions are that U.S. imperialism still stubbornly stays in South Vietnam, that it intensifies its war of aggression against South Vietnam, that it sends more troops from the United States and its lackeys to South Vietnam, that it continues to use chemical poisons and gases to carry out destructive warfare, and that it expands the "gradual escalation" of the war against North Vietnam... These are the conditions of a robber, which we, the people of South Vietnam, can never accept, and world public opinion cannot tolerate either.

    He emphasized that when the robber is staying in our house and is bringing in more military forces and weapons to continue destroying our homes, how can we stop attacking the robber?! When the enemy is still using bombs and bullets to massacre our people, who can bear to tell us to stop fighting the enemy?! We, the people of South Vietnam, love peace, but it must be true peace, peace linked to national independence. There will be no peace under slavery.

    He said that the people of South Vietnam are not afraid to compete with U.S. imperialism. The military and civilians of South Vietnam are determined to defeat it, and are defeating it. No matter what tricks U.S. imperialism uses, no matter how many troops it sends to South Vietnam, no matter how savage and brutal it is, it will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat. We will surely bury U.S. imperialism.

    He said that under the correct leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, the people of South Vietnam have achieved many major victories one after another. The military and civilians of South Vietnam are becoming stronger and more victorious in battle, forcing the American aggressors into an increasingly passive predicament. The political army of the South Vietnamese masses has never been as strong as it is today. Millions of people are rising up to fight like a storm. These struggles are fundamentally shaking the foundations of the Saigon American puppet regime.

    He said that the South Vietnam Liberation Army has become a powerful armed force, capable of fighting major battles continuously, completely annihilating one battalion after another of U.S. and puppet troops in one battle, including completely annihilating a U.S. armored battalion, and the possibility of completely annihilating an enemy battle group or regiment is emerging.

    Huang Wanli emphasized that the victory of the military and civilians in South Vietnam is a victory of skillfully applying the line of people's struggle. The practice in South Vietnam has fully proven that people's war is invincible. The practice in South Vietnam also shines with the truth of our time - that it is people, not weapons, that determine the outcome of war. He said that it is the South Vietnam National Liberation Front that organizes and leads the South Vietnamese people to win all victories. Today, in the eyes of the people of the world, the voice of the National Liberation Front is the decisive voice in solving all problems in South Vietnam. The South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the only true representative of the South Vietnamese people.

    Huang Wanli said that the victorious people of South Vietnam are determined to hold their guns firmly, determined to eliminate the American robbers and their running dogs, and determined to seize sovereignty and independence.

    Huang Wanli said that the victory of the South Vietnamese people is inseparable from the concerted efforts of the compatriots and colleagues in North Vietnam. It is inseparable from the support and assistance of the people of Asian and African countries, the people of the world, including the press of Asian and African countries and the progressive press of the world.

    He expressed that the South Vietnamese people firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. He sternly condemned and strongly protested against the reactionary dog group of U.S. imperialism in Indonesia who are very barbarically suppressing Indonesian patriots, mass organizations, and political parties. He said that the Indonesian people with a tradition of unyielding struggle will certainly not allow U.S. imperialism and its running dogs to arbitrarily stir up trouble, and will certainly rise up to stop their murderous clutches. A bright and brilliant future will surely belong to the Indonesian people.

    南越爱国民主记协代表团团长黄万里在亚非记协书记处会议上的发言
    南越人民不怕同美帝较量定能把美帝埋葬
    新华社二十二日讯越南南方爱国民主新闻工作者协会代表团团长黄万里，二十一日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上的发言中说，越南南方军民反美斗争的胜利表明，人民战争是无敌的。越南南方人民坚决紧握枪杆子，决心埋葬美国侵略者和它的走狗。
    黄万里在发言中揭露了约翰逊玩弄的“和平谈判”的骗局。黄万里说，越南南方战争的根源和战争扩大的危险是来自美帝国主义的侵略政策。因此，当前在越南南方必须解决的问题是：美帝国主义必须从越南南方撤出全部美国军队、军事人员和各种武器，撤销它在越南南方的美国军事基地，废除它同南越缔结的军事联盟，停止执行侵略南越的政策，让越南人民自己解决越南南方的问题。
    黄万里说，越南南方爱国民主新闻工作者认为，在印度尼西亚当前的形势下，亚非新闻工作者协会暂时把总部撤离雅加达是完全必要的，越南南方爱国民主新闻工作者协会完全支持这一决定。
    黄万里在讲话中强烈谴责美帝国主义正在强化在越南南方的侵略战争。他说，现在在越南南方的美军数字已增至二十四万人。约翰逊还打算增加数以十万计的美军。它还拉拢它的南朝鲜、澳大利亚、新西兰、日本、台湾、菲律宾的仆从，向南越派遣军队和技术人员，以帮助它扩大侵略战争。
    他说，美帝国主义在越南南方实行杀光、烧光、毁光的政策。犯下了滔天的罪行。在过去的十一年多期间，美帝国主义及其走狗已经屠杀了我们十七万多的同胞，使将近八十万人受伤和因审讯拷打而成为残废，监禁了四十多万人。此外，还有数以百万计的人被强迫集中在“战略村”里。一年多以来，美帝国主义变本加厉地展开无比残暴的军事“扫荡”，用大炮、飞机，甚至用B—52型战略飞机逐个地区地进行轰炸，越来越大规模地用化学毒药和毒气作为战争手段。
    黄万里强调说，美帝国主义的种种罪行，充分暴露了它极其残暴的本质，表明了美帝国主义越接近于死亡就越是疯狂和野蛮。他还谴责美帝国主义扩大侵略越南北方，扩大老挝战争，不断对柬埔寨进行威胁和挑衅。他说，这证明美国侵略者不仅是越南人民最危险最凶恶的敌人，而且是亚洲、非洲和全世界各国的和平、民族独立、民主和社会进步的头号敌人。
    黄万里谴责美帝国主义不断玩弄“和平”骗局。他说，狼披上了羊皮，却仍然是狼。约翰逊大肆叫嚷“和平”的声音，又怎能掩盖美国在越南南方的震耳的炮火声呢？越南南方的实际情况充分证明，对于美帝国主义来说，谈“和平”就是为了掩盖它的战争行动，它越是谈“和平”，就越扩大战争，谈“无条件讨论”，就是要我们接受它的条件。这些条件就是，美帝国主义仍死赖在越南南方不走，就是强化对越南南方的侵略战争，就是大举向越南南方增派美国及其仆从的军队，就是继续用化学毒药和毒气进行毁灭性的战争，就是扩大对越南北方的“逐步升级”的战争……。这是强盗的条件，我们越南南方人民决不能接受，世界舆论也决不能容许。
    他强调说，当强盗正留在我们的家里，正在运进更多的军事力量和武器，以便继续破坏我们的家园的时候，我们怎么能够停止对强盗的打击呢？！当敌人仍然继续用炸弹枪弹来残杀我国人民的时候，谁能忍心叫我们住手不再打击敌人呢？！我们越南南方人民热爱和平，但是这必须是真正的和平，同民族独立联结起来的和平。在当奴隶的情况下是不会有和平的。
    他说，越南南方人民不怕同美帝国主义较量。越南南方军民决心击败它，并且正在击败它。不管美帝国主义施展什么伎俩，派到越南南方多少万军队，不管它怎样野蛮残暴，也必定遭到可耻的失败。我们定将埋葬美帝国主义。
    他说，在越南南方民族解放阵线的正确领导下，越南南方人民接二连三地取得许多重大的胜利。越南南方军民越战越强，越战越胜，正迫使美国侵略者越来越陷于被动的困境。越南南方群众的政治大军从来没有象今天这样强大。数以百万计的人民急风骤雨般地奋起斗争。这些斗争正在从根本上动摇着西贡美国傀儡政权的基础。
    他说，越南南方解放军今天已经成为一支强大的武装力量，它能够连续打大仗，在一次战斗中全歼一营又一营的美军和伪军，包括全歼美军的装甲营，并且正在出现全歼敌军一个战团或一个团的可能性。
    黄万里强调说，越南南方军民的胜利是巧妙地运用人民斗争路线的胜利。越南南方的实践已经完全证明，人民战争是无敌的。越南南方的实践同时也使我们当代的真理——决定战争胜败的是人而不是武器的真理光芒四射。他说，正是越南南方民族解放阵线组织和领导南越人民赢得一切胜利。今天在世界人民看来，民族解放阵线的声音是解决越南南方的一切问题的决定性声音。越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民唯一真正的代表。
    黄万里说，正在取得胜利的越南南方人民坚决紧握枪杆子，决心消灭美国强盗及其走狗，决心夺得主权和独立。
    黄万里说，越南南方人民的胜利，是同越南北方同胞和同业的同心协力分不开的。是同亚非各国人民，世界人民，其中包括亚非各国的新闻界和世界进步的新闻界的支持和援助分不开的。
    他表示，越南南方人民坚决支持亚、非、拉各国人民的革命斗争。他严厉谴责和强烈抗议美帝国主义在印度尼西亚的反动走狗集团正在非常野蛮地镇压印度尼西亚爱国者、各群众团体和各政治党派。他说，具有不屈的斗争传统的印度尼西亚人民一定不会让美帝国主义及其走狗任意兴风作浪，必定将奋起制止它们的杀人魔掌。光辉灿烂的未来定将属于印度尼西亚人民。
