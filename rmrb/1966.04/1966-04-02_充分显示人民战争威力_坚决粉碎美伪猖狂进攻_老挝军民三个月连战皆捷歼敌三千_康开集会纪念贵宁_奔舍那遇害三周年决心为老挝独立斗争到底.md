    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 1st – According to Radio Pathet Lao: In the battles to defend the liberated areas, the Lao People's Liberation Army, patriotic neutral forces, and people's guerrillas eliminated a total of 3,000 enemy troops in the first three months of this year, shot down 90 American planes, damaged hundreds, and seized a large quantity of weapons, ammunition, and military supplies.

    The radio said that during these three months, the Lao People's Liberation Army, patriotic neutral forces, and people's guerrillas heavily attacked the Lao right-wing group's 16th Mobile Regiment, 13th Mobile Regiment, and 99th Parachute Battalion of the 21st Mobile Regiment, as well as many units such as the 22nd, 23rd, and 27th Volunteer Battalions, which were fostered and equipped by U.S. imperialism. They also inflicted significant casualties on the enemy's Second Military Region front command, 13th Mobile Regiment command, Kong Le's reactionary army's Fourth Parachute Battalion command, and some other commands. Over thirty lieutenant-level officers of Kong Le's army alone were killed or wounded.

    Radio Pathet Lao published a commentary on March 31, warmly hailing the major victories of the Lao patriotic military and civilians. The commentary pointed out that the victorious operations of these three months show that the Lao patriotic army is rapidly growing and becoming stronger, its tactical and technical level is constantly improving, and all units can closely coordinate operations with each other and with the people.

    The commentary said that in the battles, the patriotic forces used various tactics such as night battles, close combat, ambush warfare, and hand-to-hand combat to bravely attack and eliminate the enemy. This vividly demonstrated the combat power of the patriotic army, and also demonstrated the iron will of this people's army to overcome difficulties and resolutely strive for victory. The commentary concluded by saying that if U.S. imperialism and its lackeys continue to stubbornly and adventurously launch attacks on the patriotic military and civilians, then they will surely suffer even more shameful defeats.

    Xinhua News Agency, Khang Khay, 1st – People from all walks of life in Laos held a meeting in Khang Khay today to commemorate the third anniversary of the murder of Quinim Pholsena, the former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao National Union Government, Chairman of the Lao Peace and Neutral Party, and an outstanding patriotic politician of Laos, by U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    Khamsouk Keola, the Minister of Health and Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao National Union Government, Khamphay Boupha, representative of the Lao Patriotic Front and State Secretary for National Economy and Planning of the National Union Government, Mahakou Souvannaméty, Acting Chairman of the Lao Peace and Neutral Party, and others spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they pointed out that although U.S. imperialism and its lackeys took Quinim Pholsena's life, they could not eliminate the Lao people's patriotic spirit and their desire to maintain peace and neutrality. In the three years since Quinim Pholsena's death, the truly patriotic neutral forces in Laos have grown stronger, their unity with the Lao Patriotic Front has become closer and more consolidated, and the Lao patriotic forces and the people have achieved brilliant victories in the military and political struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. The economic, cultural, and educational construction of the liberated areas has also achieved great successes.

    The speakers pointed out that the Lao people will unite even more closely and resolutely fight to the end against the U.S. imperialist war and aggression policy and for the realization of Lao peace, neutrality, independence, democracy, unity, and prosperity. Quinim Pholsena's will must be realized, and final victory will surely belong to the Lao people.

    Also present at the commemorative meeting were General Singkapo, representative of the Supreme Command of the Lao People's Liberation Army, Colonel Deuane, Commander-in-Chief of the Military Command of the Lao Patriotic Neutral Forces, Khamlieng Pholsena, brother of Quinim Pholsena, heads of various Lao patriotic mass organizations, and people from all walks of life. The heads of the Chinese and Vietnamese economic and cultural delegations to Laos also attended the commemorative meeting.
