    Xinhua News Agency, 12th dispatch: Commentary by our reporter: In recent days, the American aggressors in South Vietnam have been trembling with unease, as if sitting on the crater of a volcano. The struggle of the people in the enemy-occupied cities of South Vietnam against the US-puppet clique could erupt into even greater storms at any time; the internal strife among the South Vietnamese puppets for power and profit is also difficult to resolve and is intensifying. Washington and Saigon's American officials are working day and night, trying to control the chaotic situation in South Vietnam and stabilize their positions.
    Washington issues almost daily statements expressing "deep unease" and serious "concern" about the situation in South Vietnam. The US State Department spokesman admitted on the 11th that "we are in contact with all elements of Vietnamese society and government." In Saigon, American officials such as "Ambassador" Lodge, "psychological warfare" expert Lansdale, and the head of the US forces in Vietnam, Westmoreland, are conducting intense activities non-stop, exerting pressure on various factions of the South Vietnamese puppet group and various South Vietnamese political forces, attempting to ease the contradictions between them and find a compromise solution.
    The purpose of the American authorities' tense behind-the-scenes activities is to hope to preserve Nguyen Cao Ky's military puppet regime, and if Nguyen Cao Ky cannot survive this storm, they will implement a "replacement," but they must maintain the rule of the military committee composed of South Vietnamese puppet generals. According to American senators, US Secretary of State Rusk recently stated at the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: "Even if the current Nguyen Cao Ky government collapses, the ruling committee of generals will continue to be in power."
    Washington's current embarrassing flurry is not difficult to understand, because the storm in South Vietnam has seriously hit the American aggression plan in South Vietnam. Just two months ago, US President Johnson warmly embraced Nguyen Cao Ky in Honolulu, attempting to strengthen the position of the South Vietnamese puppet and consolidate American rule over South Vietnam, in order to facilitate the United States' expansion of the war of aggression in South Vietnam. However, in the blink of an eye, the Nguyen Cao Ky regime is tottering amid internal strife and popular opposition, and Johnson's dream has pathetically failed. The New York Times said on the 8th: "President Johnson's public embrace of Nguyen Cao Ky at the Honolulu conference in February was an investment of Washington's prestige that is difficult to recover."
    At the Honolulu conference, the Johnson administration formulated a "pacification plan" touting "social reforms" to be implemented in South Vietnam, as a political deception measure to coordinate with American military aggression. However, the Americans themselves admit that in order to implement this plan, there must first be a "stable" South Vietnamese puppet regime, and the current precarious situation of the puppet Nguyen Cao Ky threatens to make all the plans and schedules carefully formulated by the United States "waste paper" (New York Herald Tribune). A United Press International dispatch on the 11th quoted a US official in Saigon as saying: "I am working frantically, but the best pacification plan in the world is still going to fail." This American official's words truly reflect that Washington cannot escape the logic of "making trouble, failing, making trouble again, failing again, until its demise."
    More importantly, this big storm and turmoil in South Vietnam occurred after the Honolulu conference when the Johnson administration increased its troops to South Vietnam, intensified the war, and clamored to fulfill its "obligations" to the South Vietnamese puppet regime. This cannot but be a heavy blow to the American aggressors who are determined to make a big splash in South Vietnam. Now, in the face of a crisis-ridden and dangerous situation, as Japanese newspapers pointed out: "All US measures and actions in South Vietnam have been forced to slow down, and it feels like nothing is working in any direction." The thin veil that the Johnson administration uses to cover up its aggression may also be further torn to shreds at any time.
    No matter what the outcome, the crisis of the American masters and puppets in South Vietnam will only deepen, and the American aggressive adventure in South Vietnam will only sink deeper into the quagmire, because their aggressive collusion and bloody reactionary rule in South Vietnam are completely against the will of the Vietnamese people. United Press International revealed the sad premonition of the American imperialists, saying: Currently, "Americans are on a slope, and they will not know where the end of the slope is as they slide down." Now, for the American aggressors, in front of them is the blow of the iron fists of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army and the South Vietnamese people, and behind them are active volcanoes everywhere in the heartland, and the end of the "slope" is the graveyard where they will be buried.

### 南越混乱局势使美国益陷困境  檀香山会议企图稳定南越傀儡政局的计划又落了空  美国准备在南越大干一场的部署遭到新的沉重打击

    南越混乱局势使美国益陷困境
    檀香山会议企图稳定南越傀儡政局的计划又落了空
    美国准备在南越大干一场的部署遭到新的沉重打击
    新华社十二日讯　本社记者述评：这几天来，美国侵略者在南越，就象坐在火山口上一样，战慄不安。南越敌占区城市人民反对美伪集团的斗争，随时都可能爆发成为更大的风暴；南越傀儡内部争权夺利的内讧也难解难分，愈演愈烈。华盛顿和西贡的美国官员们日以继夜地忙个不停，力图控制南越的混乱局势，稳住他们的阵脚。
    华盛顿几乎每天都要发表一个声明，表示对南越局势的“深切不安”和严重的“关切”。美国国务院发言人十一日承认，“我们同越南社会和政府的所有成分都在进行接触”。在西贡的美国“大使”洛奇、“心理战”专家兰兹代尔、侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰等文武官员马不停蹄地展开紧张的活动，对南越傀儡集团的各个派系和南越各派政治势力施加压力，企图缓和它们之间的矛盾，找出一个妥协的方案。
    美国当局紧张的幕后活动，目的是希望保住阮高其的军事傀儡政权，如果阮高其度不过这场风暴的话，就实行“换马”，但是一定要保持南越傀儡将领们组成的军事委员会的统治。据美国参议员透露，美国国务卿腊斯克最近曾经在参议院外交委员会上表示：“即使目前的阮高其政府倒台，执政的将领委员会将继续当权。”
    华盛顿目前的狼狈周章是不难理解的。因为南越的风暴首先严重打击了美国在南越的侵略计划。刚刚两个月以前，美国总统约翰逊在檀香山热烈拥抱阮高其，企图加强南越傀儡的地位，巩固美国对南越的统治，以便利美国扩大在南越的侵略战争。但是，曾几何时，阮高其政权在内部倾轧和人民反对声中摇摇欲坠，约翰逊的梦想可悲地落了空。《纽约时报》八日说：“约翰逊总统二月份在檀香山会议上同阮高其公开拥抱是把华盛顿的威信进行了一笔难以捞回的投资。”
    在檀香山会议上，约翰逊政府制订了准备在南越推行的标榜“社会改革”的“绥靖计划”，作为配合美国军事侵略行动的一种政治欺骗措施。但是，美国人自己承认，要实行这项计划，首先要有一个“稳定”的南越傀儡政权，而傀儡阮高其目前的风雨飘摇的局面，有使美国“仔细制订的一切计划和时间表都将成为废纸”的危险（《纽约先驱论坛报》）。合众国际社在十一日的一条消息中援引了一个西贡美国官员的话说：“我是拼命的干，但是这个他妈的世界上最好的绥靖计划还是要失败。”这个美国官员的话，真实地反映了华盛顿是逃脱不了“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”的逻辑的。
    更重要的是，南越这次大风暴和大动乱是发生在檀香山会议以后约翰逊政府增兵南越、强化战争，大叫大嚷要履行其对南越傀儡政权的“义务”之时。这不能不是对于决心在南越大干一场的美国侵略者的沉重打击。现在，在危机四伏、险象环生的情势下，正如日本报纸指出的：“美国在南越的一切措施和行动都被迫放慢了，而且朝任何一个方向都有行不通之感。”约翰逊政府掩饰它的侵略的那一层薄薄的面纱，也随时可能被进一步撕得粉碎。
    不管结局如何，美国主子和傀儡在南越的危机只会日益深重，美国在南越的侵略冒险只会在泥淖里愈陷愈深，因为他们的在南越的侵略勾当和血腥的反动统治，是完全违反越南人民意志的。合众国际社道出了美帝国主义者的悲哀的预感，它说：目前“美国人处于一个斜坡上，他们将不知道往下滑到哪儿才是斜坡的尽头”。现在，对美国侵略者来说，它的前面是南越解放军和南越人民铁拳的打击，后面是心脏地区到处存在的活动的火山，“斜坡”的尽头是埋葬他们的坟场。
