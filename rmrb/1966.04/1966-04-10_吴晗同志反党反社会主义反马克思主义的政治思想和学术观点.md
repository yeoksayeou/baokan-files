Edition: 5

Editor's Note: Since Comrade Yao Wenyuan's criticism of Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," a large debate has unfolded in many newspapers and periodicals across the country around this issue. As many comrades have pointed out in their articles, a black line runs through from "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" to "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," a black line against the Party and socialism.

Comrade Wu Han's errors are not accidental. In many articles he has published since the national liberation, especially since 1959, there is a series of erroneous political and academic views.

The criticism of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" should first and foremost grasp the crux of the matter, politically criticizing Comrade Wu Han for standing on the side of right-leaning opportunists who have been "dismissed" from "office" by the people, launching a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. At the same time, we must also thoroughly liquidate Comrade Wu Han's reactionary bourgeois academic viewpoints. This is a fierce struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between socialism and capitalism, a serious class struggle on the ideological front.

Below are the main erroneous arguments in Comrade Wu Han's articles published since 1959, compiled by Comrades Wang Zhengping, Ding Weizhi, and others. We hope everyone will read them carefully and actively participate in the criticism of Comrade Wu Han's political and academic errors.

(I) Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Poisonous Weeds

"Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"

When right-leaning opportunists fanned the flames, Wu Han vigorously promoted Hai Rui's spirit of daring to "scold"

In June 1959, just as domestic right-leaning opportunists were fanning the flames, and various right-leaning opportunist remarks were successively emerging, Wu Han, under the pseudonym Liu Mianzhi, published the article "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." This article, over a thousand words long, used the word "scold" nineteen times. The entire text's focus was on "scolding." He said, "In the feudal era, the emperor was inviolable," and "As for scolding the emperor, that was unheard of." "The one who truly scolded the emperor, and scolded him very happily, was Hai Rui." He not only vigorously emphasized how happily and bravely Hai Rui "scolded" the emperor but also vigorously praised the Peking Opera "Empress He Scolds the Court," saying, "The people want to scold the emperor but cannot, to scold him on stage to feel a bit of satisfaction is also good." He also said, "Because the emperor cannot be scolded, if someone really scolds him, it also feels satisfying."

In this article, Wu Han, selectively edited and embellished Hai Rui's "Memorial on Governance" into a painstakingly crafted vernacular text, subtly using the past to criticize the present. He said that Hai Rui, in his "Memorial on Governance," "scolded" the emperor with "the most severe words: 'Now the people's taxes and levies are much higher than usual, everywhere it is like this. You have spent a lot of money on religious superstition, and it is increasing day by day, making the common people poor. In these past ten years or so, it has reached its peak. The people of the world use your reign title 'Jiajing', taking the sounds of these two characters to say that 'Jiajing' means everyone is clean [净, jìng], every family is so poor that they are clean and have no money to use.'" And he said Hai Rui "scolded" like this: "The people of the world have been dissatisfied with you for a long time, all officials big and small inside and outside know it," "Your heart is confused. You are excessively harsh and decisive, and your temperament is biased. You are self-righteous and reject criticism (Editor's note: the original text of the 'Memorial on Governance' does not convey this meaning at all), you have too many mistakes." "You must know... you should immediately wake up,... study the national economy and people's livelihood, and thoroughly correct decades of mistakes, seeking benefits for the people." "The current problem is that the ruler's way is not right, and the officials' duties are not clear. This is the number one issue in the world. If this is not addressed, what else can be said!"

The conclusion of this article is: "Hai Rui greatly scolded the emperor, and people who sympathized with and supported him were everywhere, his reputation grew bigger and bigger," "Hai Rui at that time was loved by the people and praised by the people," "After his death, the people of Nanjing suspended their markets, funeral ships crossed the river, and both banks were filled with crowds dressed in white to see him off, the ceremonies of mourning stretched for miles." "Hai Rui was a clean and upright official. He opposed bad people and bad deeds and supported good people and good deeds. For the sake of the people's interests, he resolutely fought against the reactionary dark forces, unyielding. What he deserves our learning is, first, to clearly distinguish right from wrong, and second, the spirit of fighting the dark forces to the end."

When right-leaning opportunists wanted to overturn verdicts, Wu Han said to learn Hai Rui's "fearless of setbacks, fearless of sacrifice"

In September 1959, the Lushan Conference of the Party Central Committee had just ended, and right-leaning opportunists who styled themselves as "Hai Rui" had just been defeated. When some were "dismissed" from "office," Wu Han hurriedly threw out another article called "On Hai Rui." At the end of this article were a few sentences, detached from the main text, that supposedly "opposed" right-leaning opportunism, but the theme did not change; it was still praising Hai Rui and, in conjunction with the current struggle situation, made the words even clearer. He said that Hai Rui "wrote a letter to the Jiajing Emperor, making severe criticisms." He prominently emphasized Hai Rui's spirit of "not fearing setbacks, not fearing sacrifice," saying that Hai Rui "opposed bad people and bad deeds, unyielding, never discouraged, bravely throwing his whole life into battle." "Although he lived in such an era, he still adhered to his beliefs, fighting unyieldingly until death." "Despite suffering multiple failures, sometimes he was very indignant, saying such frustrated words as 'What can be accomplished in such a world!'" But... he was not discouraged, not resigned to old age, not afraid of setbacks, truly a 'resolute man.'" He "is 'strong and upright,' is a great man, is a true man of ancient and modern times," a "contemporary great man" for "ten thousand generations to admire."

This article also subtly launched a large-scale attack on what he called the spirit of "village good man." He said a "village good man" is one who "mediates everything, occupies the middle ground, avoids struggle, refuses to criticize people, turns with the wind, acts smoothly, always leaves a way out, is unwilling to take responsibility for doing good things, and is also afraid of being tainted by bad things, like licorice root in traditional Chinese medicine, a dose can be added for any disease, it won't cure it, but it won't make it worse either." "Precisely because of this, they can preserve their position," "cannot be squeezed out." "Precisely because of this, officials learned from it, and it became a trend."

This article also praised the story of Hai Rui daring to "provoke" high officials, which "pleased the people," and commented: "The common people in the feudal era were afraid of officials, even more so of high officials. Now, there is an official who is not afraid of high officials, dares to confront high officials, dares to support the common people and speak for them. This official will naturally be loved by the common people." Moreover, he felt that Hai Rui's "integrity" was not flavorful enough. He said that criticizing Hai Rui for being "excessive, too straightforward" is incorrect. "It should be said that it is not enough, rather than being too straightforward. Considering the situation at the time and place, considering the very bitter suffering of the people, for whom it was worth crying bitterly and sighing deeply, being too straightforward should be very good, rather than very bad."

In this article, Wu Han raised the issue of "dismissal from office" for the first time. He said:
"The good thing had just begun when Xu Jie drew the rug out from under him, and Hai Rui was dismissed. The bandits were not all captured, and instead, he lost his office. This was not what Hai Rui had anticipated."

When right-leaning opportunists wanted to overturn the verdict, Wu Han promoted Hai Rui's "never give in" and "strong will to keep going after failure"

At the end of 1959, Wu Han "broke out of his shell" and began writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." After seven revisions, it was officially published in January 1961. This was precisely the time when those right-leaning opportunists who had been dismissed from office by the Party harbored discontent and attempted to overturn the verdict.

In the "Preface" to this play, Wu Han said, "This play focuses on writing about Hai Rui's unyielding integrity, not submitting to tyranny, not being frightened by failure, and having the strong will to keep going after failure." "In this struggle, Hai Rui lost his office, but he did not give in, nor did he lose heart. At the time, the people supported him and praised him because he had done good deeds. Hai Rui's position in history should be affirmed, and some of his good qualities are also worthy of our learning today."

In "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Wu Han shaped the "hero" Hai Rui, who "pleads for the people's lives," implying that the situation of socialism was not good, singing out "Jiangnan is in dire straits and suffering, not withdrawing the occupied land will not last long," "Wrongful cases must be redressed, only by returning the land can the people be at peace." He highlighted Hai Rui's image of "wanting to take charge for the people's livelihood," "fighting the dark forces to the end," "not submitting to tyranny," "not fearing death," "even if dismissed and imprisoned, he still acted as he always had, consistent in word and deed, unyielding," and vigorously promoted the spirit of "old age remains proud, how can he bend his waist to flatter powerful officials." The theme of the whole play is "dismissal from office." "Dismissal from office" is "being framed," "my dismissal is unreasonable." Even after being dismissed from office, one cannot leave "with one's tail between one's legs," one must kill a person before leaving. And he sings loudly: "Even if losing office is not understood, a pure name will be passed down for eternity," "I, Hai Rui, lose my official hat but my heart is open, one day when I take office again, I will reorganize the discipline." At the end, the chorus sings from behind the curtain: "The weather is cold, the ground is frozen, the wind is howling, countless thoughts tug at the heart, Father Hai cannot be kept from returning south, ten thousand families burn incense for the living Buddha."

When Wu Han threw out this play, "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he was complacent. In the "Preface to Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he claimed to be "belonging to the daring type," and also called on "friends in the historical circles" to "write a little" of "new historical plays" like his!

Beautifying Hai Rui as the "savior of the oppressed, bullied, and wronged people"

To coordinate with "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and expand the publicity effect, Wu Han also wrote articles such as "Honest Official Hai Rui," "Hai Rui," and published the booklet "The Story of Hai Rui," posing as a "Hai Rui expert" and swaggering through the market.

In these articles and plays, Wu Han vigorously promoted the poison of feudal restorationism, praising how Hai Rui promoted "royal law," "rectified discipline," and "enforced the imperial law" to the peasants, praising Hai Rui's "upright and stalwart," "incorruptible," "frugal," "consistent in word and deed," and "consistent inside and out" "good qualities," and these qualities were due to "reading the books of sages and doing the deeds of sages." The so-called "consistency in word and deed" meant: "His daily life and political behavior, and the article 'Strict Teacher's Instructions' that he wrote, corresponded to each other, without any falsehood," "Every word and action had to mention how things were in ancient times, how the former kings did things. When acting as an official, he firmly adhered to the established practices of the ancestors." Wu Han emphasized that these "good qualities" of Hai Rui should be learned and promoted today, and said that "studying Hai Rui and learning from Hai Rui" "has practical significance."

Wu Han intentionally emphasized how Hai Rui "did good things" for the people, how he was "loved" by the people, saying that he "cared for the people, thinking of everything for the common people," "standing on the position of peasants and citizens to fight against feudal bureaucrats and big landlords his whole life"; saying that he "sympathized with poor and middle peasants and was repulsed by big landlords," "in cases of lawsuits between peasants and landlords, he stood on the side of the peasants"; saying that he "stood on the side of the people, opposing bad people and bad deeds his whole life, and never opposed good people and good deeds"; saying that he "was the savior of the oppressed, bullied, and wronged people at that time."

"况钟和周忱" (Kuàng Zhōng Hé Zhōu Chén - Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen), "明代民族英雄于谦" (Míng Dài Mínzú Yīngxióng Yú Qiān - Ming Dynasty National Hero Yu Qian), "赵括和马谡" (Zhào Kuò Hé Mǎ Sù - Zhao Kuo and Ma Su) praised Kuang Zhong for "straightforwardly criticizing the emperor," and complained about Zhou Chen's "dismissal from office"

In September 1960, when Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" had not yet emerged, he wrote an article titled "Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen." In this article, he especially emphasized the so-called "Hai Rui spirit" of Kuang Zhong and Zhou Chen. He praised Kuang Zhong for being "upright, incorruptible, highly valuing small matters, thinking thoroughly, not fearing small matters, doing whatever was beneficial to the people, and reforming whatever was harmful to the people." He said Kuang Zhong "punished corrupt officials," "cleared up wrongful cases," "promoted benefits and eliminated harms, opposed the powerful, and supported the good. The people respected and loved him, regarding him as a god." He praised Kuang Zhong for being "naturally frugal, the house he lived in had no furnishings, and he only ate one meat dish and one vegetable dish for meals." "When acting as an official, he did not use a secretary, and personally handled all reports and documents," "In the report requesting rent reduction for official land, he straightforwardly criticized the emperor for breaking his promise, without any concealment." He said that Kuang Zhong in Suzhou "resolutely implemented the policies of the feudal dynasty," "proposed specific methods for reducing rents on official land and exempting arrears," "This was indeed a remarkable good thing for the people of Suzhou," and the people were "jubilant, grateful for Kuang Zhong's grace, and erected monuments everywhere to commemorate this good thing." He said that when Kuang Zhong resigned and returned home due to the death of his stepmother, "Suzhou became dark again, the atmosphere changed again, the officials and clerks started doing bad things again, and the people suffered again. They thought about it and realized it was all because Kuang Zhong was no longer there." "Kuang Zhong served as prefect for thirteen years. When he died, the common people were sad and cried bitterly, and even businesses suspended their markets. The funeral procession stretched along the road and the river, Suzhou and the seven counties all built ancestral halls and painted portraits for worship, and some families even enshrined his portrait at home."

Wu Han also called Kuang Zhong "Kuang Qingtian (Kuang the Blue Sky)," saying that the people "yearned" for "relatively enlightened, lenient, and incorrupt" politics. The people "supported" "good officials who could take some measures to reduce the people's burden and redress their grievances," and "for such good officials, the people made an assessment, calling them Qingtian." Wu Han believed that these "Qingtian" should be "affirmed" and worthy of "commemoration" and "learning" in history.

Wu Han praised Zhou Chen as "the most skilled in financial management and the most capable good official," "not putting on bureaucratic airs, approaching the people, listening to the opinions of the masses," "becoming familiar with the people, like family," "talking to farmers face-to-face, chatting casually, asking what difficulties and problems they had, and helping them come up with ideas." "The people liked him very much." He said that Zhou Chen "created the Pingmi Law," "reduced" rent and taxes on official land, "the people's burden was reduced," and "the people's livelihood was also stabilized"; "He was eventually attacked by the landlords and dismissed from office, leaving Jiangnan," "The people missed him even more, and erected ancestral halls everywhere to commemorate this good official who loved the people."

Promoting "Minister of War" Yu Qian for "making great contributions," although killed by Emperor Yingzong, finally "restored his reputation"

After "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" came out, Wu Han felt it was not enough, so he brought out Yu Qian. In June 1961, in the article "Ming Dynasty National Hero Yu Qian," he said: Yu Qian from a young age had a "strong character," and when he was an imperial censor, "Emperor Xuanzong admired him very much, considering him to be a remarkable talent." He said that when Yu Qian was on a tour in Jiangxi, "he discovered hundreds of unjust cases, and all were redressed." When he was the governor of Henan and Shanxi, "he attached great importance to investigation and research work. As soon as he took office, he rode a horse to inspect everywhere, and in all the places he went, he invited elderly local people to talk to him to understand the local situation, the gains and losses of politics, the burdens and sufferings of the common people, what should be done and what should not be done. As soon as he discovered a problem, he immediately put forward opinions and wrote a report to the emperor. When there were floods or droughts, he also reported them in a timely manner and carried out relief efforts. He was very clear about the local situation, and his political measures were also very timely, thus gaining the praise and support of the people." Wu Han praised Yu Qian for "serving as governor for nine years, with enlightened politics and high prestige. Robbers and thieves all scattered and fled, and the common people lived a relatively stable life. Because of his political achievements, the Ming Dynasty government promoted him to Vice Minister of War," and later promoted him to Minister of War (Minister of Defense -- this is Wu Han's own note).

Wu Han said "Yu Qian was an honest official," "concerned about the country and forgetting himself. Although he made great contributions, protected Beijing, and brought back the emperor, he was very modest and did not speak of his merits," "Working day and night for the country," "living a very simple life. Every time he entered the court, not only did he not send gifts or bribes, he did not even send ordinary greetings," so "although the common people liked him very much, the powerful officials in the court hated him to death." Wu Han said: Precisely because Yu Qian had a "straightforward character" and "refused to pander" to the powerful officials, he was opposed by the powerful officials everywhere," and later even killed by Emperor Yingzong. Not long after, the border areas were in urgent need, and because there was no Yu Qian, Emperor Yingzong regretted it. Later, "Yu Qian's political enemies all failed one after another," "Yu Qian's son, Yu Mian, was pardoned and returned home, writing a letter to the emperor to appeal for justice. Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty restored Yu Qian's official position and sent people to offer sacrifices, and the sacrificial text said: 'When the country was in great difficulty, he protected the state and made it safe. He upheld justice alone and was envied by treacherous officials. The late emperor already knew he was wronged, and We truly pity his loyalty.' These few words were widely circulated at the time. Yu Qian's reputation was restored. In the second year of Hongzhi of Emperor Xiaozong of the Ming Dynasty (1489 AD), Yu Qian was posthumously named Sumin, and an ancestral hall was built, named Jinggong. During the Wanli period of Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty, he was renamed Zhongsu. The people of Hangzhou, Kaifeng, Shanxi, and Beijing all built ancestral halls for him, and the broad masses of people will forever commemorate this national hero who defended Beijing, immortal!"

Wu Han believed that Yu Qian, just as he said in his poem "Ode to Lime," "Fearing not the raging fire, fearing not being crushed to powder, he wants to leave his purity in the world."

At the end of this article, Wu Han especially emphasized: although Yu Qian died, the final victory was still Yu Qian's. He said: After Yu Qian's death, "the broad masses of people deeply mourned Yu Qian, and at the time they did not dare to name him directly, so they made a ballad:

The egret walks on the ice, where can it find fish to nibble?
The fish to nibble is a homophone of Yu Qian, the image of this national hero is forever left in the memory of the people."

Want people to "revisit" those "lessons" of "subjectivism," "doctrinairism," "framing" of the loyal and good, and "harming oneself, harming others, and misleading the country"

In early 1962, in the article "Zhao Kuo and Ma Su," Wu Han said: Zhao Kuo and Ma Su both "suffered from subjectivism, suffered from doctrinairism, and were self-righteous," "changing the objective reality based on subjective wishes and imagination," "ignoring the objective situation and not listening to the advice of people with practical experience, and the result was a big tumble." This "lesson of harming oneself, harming others, and misleading the country," "although the time has passed for a long time, it seems to be beneficial to revisit these lessons today."

In July 1962, in the article "The Fate of the Family of the Singer of 'Song of Chariot' (敕勒歌)," Wu Han praised the Chariot (敕勒) tribal general Hulujin for being "naturally straightforward," "good at using troops, and having rich military experience," praised Hulujin's son Huluguang for "joining the army from his youth and never being defeated," "naturally frugal, not seeking wealth, eliminating bribes, and having no guests at his door." He praised Hulujin's second son, Huluxian, for being "naturally cautious and upright, and because his family was too noble, he was not only not proud but often worried." As a result, they were all killed for offending the "昏庸无能的 emperor" and being framed by "villains". Wu Han expressed infinite sympathy for them, saying, "The fate of the Hulujin family also represents the fate of good generals and loyal ministers under the rule of feudal emperors. The contradictions within the ruling class are irreconcilable at any time."

In the article "Wang Huizu on Being a County Magistrate," Wu Han promoted Wang Huizu's book "学治臆说" (Xué Zhì Yì Shuō - Personal Views on Learning to Govern), saying that this book "mainly discusses the experience of hearing cases and collecting money and grain," "Some experiences are still interesting," such as "Do not rely on talent and knowledge to act independently," "Adapt to local conditions and the times, do not rely solely on old experience," "If you want to use the people's strength, you must first cherish the people's strength." Wu Han believed that reading such books "can extract some useful things from them."

(II) Opposing the Use of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought as a Guide for Studying History

Rambling about there is a "better left than right" tendency in the academic world, "non-historical" style of study

Starting in 1959, a great situation of historical revolution appeared in China's historical circles. Under the call of the Party, the broad masses of historians launched a revolutionary and critical review of the entire historical heritage. However, this revolution also aroused the fierce opposition of Wu Han and others, and their slogan was: "Anti-Left."

In 1961, Wu Han said in "Several Issues in Historical Textbooks and Historical Research": "It seems that there is a tendency in the historical circles to be better left than right. Being right is afraid of making mistakes, being a little left is not a big problem. This is reflected in the evaluation of historical figures, where there is often more belittling than praise, figures who should be affirmed are not dared to be affirmed, figures who should not be negated are negated, and even if they are affirmed, a small tail must be added to demand them in the way modern people are demanded." He also said, "Only starting from certain policies and guidelines today, forcing historical reality to obey today's reality is unscientific and a non-historical style of study. This trend is very wrong,... we must resolutely oppose it."

In the article "Valuing the Present over the Past and Using the Past to Serve the Present," he said: "One-sidedly disapproving of the past and severing history, making it 'unprecedented,' is also unreasonable and does not conform to objective reality," which "will make it difficult for our next generation to understand the excellent traditions of the motherland's history and literature and art."

Believing that writing history from the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of Marxism-Leninism is "taking a nihilistic attitude towards the great history of the motherland"

Wu Han expressed great antipathy to studying history from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism. In 1962, in the article "On the Popularization of Historical Knowledge," he said: Some people "believe that only what is written from the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism is history. There was no Marxism-Leninism in the past, only feudalism and idealism. Therefore, the old history is completely untrustworthy, and they therefore take a nihilistic attitude towards the great history of the motherland." In the same year, he said in another article: Some people "believe that modern historians should write history and create history according to the methods of Marxism-Leninism and according to their own imagination. I think such historians are truly 'creators of history.'"

Wu Han also opposed quoting the opinions of classical writers in history books. In the article "How to Learn History," he said: "Everyone has read 'Records of the Grand Historian'. Sima Qian had his own views when narrating events." "But now some people use the views of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin to replace them, so what about the author's own views? I'm sorry! There is none. In this way, the author places himself outside the writing position, so readers can only see the opinions of classical writers but not the opinions of the author. We have to ask, since you have no opinion, why write so much, wasting paper and ink, and also wasting the reader's time!" In an article "Gathering of Immortals and Contending of a Hundred Schools," he said: "A few people recite books in public. He is very serious, copying down relevant words of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Chairman Mao, and reciting them verbatim, completely correctly. But what about his own opinion? I'm sorry, there is none. What about his views on this issue? I'm still sorry, there is none. In this way, after reciting it several times, there is no vying and no contending, and it collapses."

Advocating learning history first and then learning theory. Saying "as long as the real historical facts are clearly presented, the viewpoint will naturally come out"

Wu Han used the pretext of opposing "replacing history with theory" to oppose studying history guided by Marxist theory and Mao Zedong Thought. He said, "Theory is in history, not outside history," "As long as the real historical facts are clearly presented, the viewpoint will naturally come out." "Stringing together a lot of historical materials and different records in a concise manner can reveal problems and solve problems through careful research." He summarized this view as "theory coming from history."

Wu Han also said: "Some people ask whether to learn theory first or learn history first? I think learn history first and then learn theory. Grasp the actual things to test the theory, otherwise, who will the theory combine with?"

Regarding the authenticity of historical materials, he believed: "Chinese historians have a good tradition of recording things truthfully, even if there is a risk of death." He also said: "As for some people who advocate 'breaking through' historical records and destroying the history forged by the feudal ruling class, my view is that historical records cannot be broken through, because this is an objective existence that no one can break through."

Using the face of "authority" to teach young people to "dig into old books"

How should one study history? Wu Han replied: "To be concise, the answer is only two words: read." He also promoted this method of learning, saying that this is the only way to obtain knowledge, he said: "The only way to obtain any new knowledge is to learn, learn from people who have this knowledge, learn from books that record this knowledge."

Wu Han promoted to young people that "anyone can become an expert scholar, the key lies in whether they work hard and whether they can overcome all the difficulties blocking them." How to overcome difficulties? It is necessary to achieve "three diligences" -- "diligently reading, diligently copying, and diligently writing." He wanted young people to "dig into old books." He said, "There is nothing wrong with digging in," "In order to inherit, you must dig in. You should have courage and be bolder." In order to provide a model, Wu Han also specially introduced his own "experience" of "digging into the vast Ming Dynasty historical materials" when he was young, finally becoming famous and establishing a career.

Wu Han believed that the broad masses of historians in China did not take the path he pointed out, but instead responded to the call of the Party to go to the worker-peasant-soldier masses, participate in the socialist revolution movement, and participate in labor, so they messed it up. He satirized young teachers for "participating in many political movements," but "not reading enough books, and not being solid enough," "Not old, not specialized, and not established." He lectured: you only "study hard," "If you don't do this, the waves will get bigger and bigger," "You should also be like my children, drink more seawater, and even be knocked down by the waves."

(III) Opposing the Evaluation of Historical Figures from the Proletarian Standpoint

Using the excuse of opposing "the theory of only component," opposing class analysis

Wu Han vigorously opposed the use of class analysis to study historical figures. In 1962, in the article "On the Evaluation of Historical Figures," he said that Marxist historians "one-sidedly and vulgarly analyzed classes." He said this was "the theory of only component." He reminded people to "pay special attention": "Class origin is by no means the fundamental condition for evaluating historical figures," and is by no means the "only yardstick" for evaluating historical figures. "If you only use class origin to evaluate historical figures, then it will be terrible, because the result of doing so is that almost all outstanding historical figures will be negated." "May I ask, which great politician of the past did not come from the landlord class?"

Wu Han said, "The problem is not their class origin," "The main thing is to see" "what new things they have provided more than their predecessors. As long as there is a contribution and new things,... it should be affirmed without hesitation."

Advocating that the evaluation of historical figures should be based on "the standards of the time and place," and based on the "comments of the great politicians" at the time

In October 1959, at the Nankai University Science Discussion Meeting, Wu Han proposed that the evaluation of historical figures should be based on "the standards of the time and place." In 1962, in the article "On the Evaluation of Historical Figures," he further promoted this view, saying:

"Is the evaluation of historical figures based on the standards of today's time and place, or based on the standards of the time and place at that time?" "Obviously, when evaluating historical figures, this figure must be placed in the historical period in which he lived, compared with his contemporaries, and compared with his predecessors; but never use the conditions and moral standards of today's time and place to measure the ancients, because if you do this, you will make history a dark mess, and there will be no outstanding historical figures to be affirmed."

In the article "On the Evaluation of Historical Figures," Wu Han also put forward the argument that the evaluation of historical figures should be based on "the opinions of most people at that time and place." He said: "Generally speaking, for figures who have played a role in history at that time, there will be different opinions at that time and in later generations. Which view is correct? It should mainly be based on the opinions of most people at that time and place." Taking Wu Zetian as an example, it is necessary to "base the evaluation on the great politicians of the Tang Dynasty" and "study Wu Zetian based on the opinions of the Tang people and based on the directly recorded historical materials."

Regarding the evaluation of Hai Rui, Wu Han said: "Hai Rui at that time was loved by the people and praised by the people," "Should he not be affirmed and praised by us?" In the article "On Hai Rui," Wu Han quoted a large number of good comments on Hai Rui from Liang Yunlong, the governor of Huguang in the Ming Dynasty, Wang Honghui, a Bachelor of the Hanlin Academy, Gu Yuncheng, Peng Zungu, Zhu Shouxian, Jinshi who worked in the Ministry of Personnel, He Liangjun, a big landlord, and Gao Gong and Zhang Juzheng, prime ministers. But Wu Han's conclusion was: "The overall comment is that the people at that time said he was good, and the big landlords at that time said he was not good."

Insisting that pointing out the limitations of the ancients is "not in line with the principle"

Regarding historical figures, Wu Han opposed pointing out their limitations. He said: "In many textbooks and biographies, after affirming this figure, the tone often turns and says, 'It's a pity, it's a pity, this person was unfortunately born in that era and was limited by that era, having limitations, etc.' In fact, which era's people have no limitations? How can the people of our era not have limitations? The Soviets Gagarin and Titov went to the sky, we still can't now, isn't this a limitation? We have suffered continuous disasters in the past three years. Although the severity of natural disasters has been greatly reduced due to the Three Red Banners, we still cannot subdue nature, isn't this a limitation? We ourselves often make mistakes in this work and that work due to low theoretical level and lack of practical experience, isn't this a limitation? It should be clear that limitations are not limited to the ancients, but that people of any era have them. It's not just that we ourselves have limitations, but future people will also have them. I don't think it's in line with the principle to use this to demand and criticize the ancients."

He also said: "For example, some people take a negative attitude towards most historical figures other than the leaders of peasant wars. Or, although they are affirmed, they always add the same thing in the conclusion: 'Limited by the limitations of the era, they were unable to do what later people did, etc.' The uniform statements cannot but make young readers feel bored and depressed, and they can only put down their books and not read them."

(IV) Glorifying Emperors and Generals, Vilifying the Laboring People

Accusing many historical textbooks of "especially emphasizing peasant uprisings," making the motherland's history "a dark mess"

Wu Han said: "In many kinds of teaching materials, they all emphasize peasant uprisings, peasant wars." He was very dissatisfied with this, the reason being: "First, only write about one side of the peasant uprising, not write or write less about the side that the peasants opposed, so that almost only one side of the class struggle is left"; "Second, due to the special emphasis on peasant uprisings, it is bound to compress the narration of other aspects, the history of peasant uprisings has a tendency to replace the general history of China" "Third, to emphasize the

    吴晗同志反党反社会主义反马克思主义的政治思想和学术观点
    编者按　自从姚文元同志批判吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》以来，全国许多报刊围绕这个问题，展开了一场大辩论。正如许多同志在文章中所指出的，从《海瑞骂皇帝》到《海瑞罢官》，贯串着一条反党反社会主义的黑线。
    吴晗同志的错误不是偶然的。他在全国解放以来特别是一九五九年以来发表的许多文章中，包含一系列的错误的政治观点和学术观点。
    对《海瑞罢官》的批判，首先应当抓住要害，从政治上批判吴晗同志站在被人民“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子一边，向党和社会主义发动猖狂进攻，同时也要从学术上清算吴晗同志的反动的资产阶级学术观点。这是无产阶级同资产阶级、社会主义同资本主义之间的一场激烈的斗争，是思想战线上的一场严重的阶级斗争。
    下面发表的是王正萍、丁伟志等同志整理的吴晗同志一九五九年以来发表的文章中的主要错误论点。我们希望大家认真读一读，并踊跃参加对吴晗同志的政治错误和学术错误的批判。
    （一）反党反社会主义的大毒草
    《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》
    右倾机会主义分子煽风点火时，吴晗极力渲染海瑞的敢“骂”精神
    一九五九年六月间，正当国内右倾机会主义分子煽风点火，各种右倾机会主义言论陆续出笼的时候，吴晗化名刘勉之，发表了《海瑞骂皇帝》一文。这篇文章共千多字，“骂”字竟用了十九处。全文的中心就是“骂”。他说“在封建时代，皇帝是不可侵犯的”，“至于骂皇帝，那是没有听说过的。”“真正骂过皇帝，而又骂得非常之痛快的是海瑞。”他不但极力渲染海瑞“骂”皇帝“骂”得如何痛快和勇敢，而且还极力赞扬京剧《贺后骂殿》，说：“人民想骂皇帝而不可得，在戏上骂骂，痛快一下，也是好的。”还说：“因为皇帝不能骂，真有人骂了，却也痛快。”
    在这篇文章中，吴晗斩头去尾、添油加醋地把海瑞的《治安疏》精心编制成了一篇白话文，含沙射影，借古非今。他说，海瑞在《治安疏》里，“骂”皇帝“骂得最厉害的几句话就是：‘现在人民的赋役要比平常多许多，到处都是这样，您花了许多钱，用在宗教迷信上，而且一天比一天多，弄得老百姓都穷的光光的，这十几年来闹到极点。天下人民就用您改元的年号“嘉靖”，取这两个字音说，“嘉靖”皆净，家家穷得干干净净，没有钱用’”。并且说海瑞是这样“骂”的：“天下的人不满意你已经很久了，内外大小官员谁都知道”“你的心迷惑了。过于苛断，你的性情偏了。你自以为是，拒绝批评（编者按：《治安疏》此处的原文，根本不是这个意思），你的错误太多了”。“你要知道，……应该立即醒悟过来，……研究国计民生，痛改几十年的错误，为人民谋些福利。”“目前的问题是君道不正，臣职不明，这是天下第一件大事。这事不说，别的还说什么！”
    这篇文章的结语是：“海瑞大骂皇帝，同情他和支持他的人到处都是，他的名声越来越大了”，“海瑞在当时，是得到人民爱戴、为人民所歌颂的”，“死后，南京人民罢市，丧船过江，两岸站满了穿白衣来送葬的人群，奠祭拜哭的百里不绝”。“海瑞是个清廉正直的官吏。他反对坏人坏事，支持好人好事。为了人民的利益，他坚决向反动黑暗势力斗争，百折不挠。他值得我们学习的地方，第一是明辨是非，第二是和黑暗势力斗争到底的精神。”
    右倾机会主义分子刚被击败，吴晗说要学习海瑞的“不怕挫折，不怕牺牲”
    一九五九年九月，党中央庐山会议刚刚结束，自命为“海瑞”的右倾机会主义分子刚刚被击败。有的被“罢”了“官”的时候，吴晗急忙抛出了另一篇文章，叫做《论海瑞》。这篇文章的末尾，有几句游离于全文之外的所谓“反对”右倾机会主义的词句，但主题并没有变，还是吹捧海瑞，并且结合现实的斗争形势，把话说得更加明白了。他说，海瑞“写信给嘉靖帝，提出严厉批评”。他突出地强调海瑞的“不怕挫折，不怕牺牲”的精神，说海瑞“反对坏人坏事，不屈不挠，从不灰心丧气，勇敢地把全生命投入战斗”。“虽然他所处的是那样一个时代，还是坚持自己的信念，不屈不挠地斗争到死。”“尽管遭受多次失败，有时候很愤慨，说出了‘这等世界，做得成甚事业！’的气话。但……不气馁，不服老，不怕挫折，真是‘铮铮一汉子’。”“是‘强哉矫’，是大丈夫，是古往今来一个真男子”，是“万代瞻仰”的“当代伟人”。
    这篇文章，还含沙射影，向他所谓的“乡愿”精神大肆攻击。他说“乡愿”就是“凡事调停，自居中间，逃避斗争，不肯批评人，遇风转舵，作事圆滑，总留有后路，不肯负责任做好事，也怕坏事沾了边，好比中药里的甘草，什么病都可以加一味，治不好，也坏不了。”“正因为这样，才能保住禄位”，“挤他不掉”。“也正因为这样，官员们学了样，成为风气。”
    这篇文章，还歌颂了海瑞敢于“惹”大官、“快人心”的故事，并且评论道：“封建时代的老百姓是怕官的，更怕大官。如今居然有不怕大官，敢顶大官的小官，敢替老百姓撑腰说话的小官，这个官自然就得到老百姓的爱戴了。”而且他还觉得，海瑞那种“刚直”还不够味道。他说：批评海瑞“过火，过直”，是不对的。“应该说是不够，而不是什么过直。就当时当地的情况说，就当时苦楚特甚，可为痛哭，可为长太息的百姓说，过直应该是好得很，而不是糟得很。”
    吴晗在这篇文章里，第一次提出了“罢官”的问题。他说：
  “好事才开头，便被徐阶釜底抽薪，海瑞罢职了，贼没全擒到，反而丢了官，这是海瑞所没预料到的。”
    右倾机会主义分子想翻案时，吴晗宣传海瑞“并不屈服”，“失败了再干的坚强意志”
    一九五九年年底，吴晗“破门而出”，开始写《海瑞罢官》。经过七次修改，一九六一年一月正式发表。这正是那些被党罢了官的右倾机会主义分子，心怀不满，企图翻案的时节。
    吴晗在这个剧本的《前言》中说：“这个戏着重写海瑞的刚直不阿，不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干的坚强意志。”“在这场斗争中，海瑞丢了官，但他并不屈服，不丧气。当时人民因为他做了好事，拥护他，歌颂他。海瑞的地位在历史上是应该肯定的，他的一些好的品德，也是值得我们今天学习的。”
    在《海瑞罢官》中，吴晗塑造了“为民请命”的“英雄”——海瑞，影射社会主义的大势不好了，唱出了“江南困苦凄凉相，不退占田不久长”，“冤狱重重要平反，退田才能使民安”。突出海瑞“要为生民作主张”，“同黑暗势力斗争到底”，“不为强暴所屈”，“不怕杀身之祸”，“纵然罢官坐牢，还是行其故素，心口如一，百折不磨”的形象，大力宣扬“老来傲骨犹然在，岂肯折腰媚权臣”的精神。整个戏的主题思想是“罢官”。“罢官”，是“被人倾陷”，“将我罢职理不公”。罢了官，还不能走得“灰溜溜”地，要杀一个人再走。并高歌：“纵然丢官不见谅，清名千古永流芳”，“我海瑞丢乌纱心胸开朗，有一日再居官重整纪纲”。结束时，幕后合唱：“天寒地冻风萧萧，去思牵心千万条，海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧。”
    吴晗在抛出《海瑞罢官》这一剧本时，踌躇满志，在《海瑞罢官序》中，声称自己是“属于敢的一流”，并且还号召“历史学界朋友们”“大家来写点”象他这样的“新历史剧”！
    把海瑞美化成“被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星”
    为配合《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》，扩大宣传效果，吴晗还写了《清官海瑞》、《海瑞》等文章，出了小册子《海瑞的故事》，俨然以“海瑞专家”的身份，招摇过市。
    在这些文章和剧本中，吴晗极力宣扬封建的复古主义的毒素，歌颂海瑞如何向农民宣传“王法”，“整顿纪纲”，“申三尺皇家法”，歌颂海瑞的“大丈夫顶天立地”、“刚直不阿”、“廉洁”、“节俭”、“言行一致”、“里外如一”等“好的品德”，而这些品德是由于“读圣贤书，行圣贤事”的缘故。所谓“言行一致”，就是说：“他的日常生活和政治行为，和所著《严师教戒》文章对证，一一符合，没有丝毫的假”，“一言一动都要说古代如何、先王如何。作官办事则坚守祖宗朝的成法”。吴晗强调今天应该学习和提倡海瑞这些“好品德”，并且说，“研究海瑞，学习海瑞”，是“有现实意义的”。
    吴晗着意渲染海瑞如何为人民“办了好事”，如何受人民“爱戴”，说他“爱护人民，一切为老百姓着想”，“站在农民和市民的立场上向封建官僚、大地主斗争了一生”；说他“同情贫农、中农，对大地主有反感”，“对农民和地主打官司的案件，他是站在农民一边的”；说他“站在人民方面，一生反对坏人坏事，从没有反对过好人好事”；说他“是当时被压抑、被欺侮、被冤屈人们的救星”。
    《况钟和周忱》、《明代民族英雄于谦》、《赵括和马谡》为况钟“直率批评皇帝”叫好，替周忱“罢官”喊冤
    一九六○年九月，当吴晗的《海瑞罢官》还没有出笼的时候，他写了一篇《况钟和周忱》。在这篇文章中，他特别强调况钟和周忱的所谓“海瑞精神”。他颂扬况钟“刚直廉洁，极重视细小事件，设想周密，不怕是小事，只要有利于百姓就做，对百姓有害的就加以改革。”说况钟“惩办贪吏”，“清理冤狱”，“兴利除害，反对豪强，扶持良善，百姓敬他爱他，把他看作天神一样。”称赞况钟“生性俭朴，住的房子没有什么陈设，吃饭也只用一荤一素。”“作官办事，不用秘书，一切报告文件都亲自动手”，“在请求官田减租的报告上，直率批评皇帝失信，毫不隐讳。”说况钟在苏州“坚决执行封建王朝的政策”，“提出官田减租和蠲免欠粮的具体办法”，“这对苏州人民来说，确是一件了不起的大好事”，人民“欢欣鼓舞，感谢况钟的恩德，到处刻碑纪念这件好事”。说当况钟因继母死，辞官回家时，“苏州的天又黑了，风气又变了，官们吏们又重新做坏事了，百姓又吃苦头了。他们想了一想，都是况钟不在的缘故”。说“况钟作了十三年知府，死的时候，老百姓伤心痛哭，连作生意的也罢市了。送丧的沿路沿江不绝，苏州和七个县都建立了祠堂、画象祭祀，有的人家甚至把他的象供在家里。”
    吴晗还称况钟为“况青天”，说人民是“向往”“比较清明、宽大、廉洁”的政治的。人民是“拥护”“能够采取一些措施，减轻人民负担，伸雪人民冤枉的好官”的，“对于这样的好官，人民作了鉴定，叫作青天”。吴晗认为这些“青天”，在历史上应该被“肯定”，值得“纪念”和“学习”。
    吴晗赞誉周忱是“最会理财最能干的好官”，“不摆官僚架子，接近人民，倾听群众意见”，“和百姓熟了，象一家人一样”，“和农夫农妇面对面说家常话，谈谈心，问问有什么困难，什么问题，帮着出主意。”“人民很喜欢他”。说周忱“创立平米法”，“减免”官田租粮，“人民的负担减轻了”，“民生也安定了”；“最后被地主攻击，罢官离开江南”，“百姓越发想念他，到处建立生祠，纪念这个爱民的好官”。
    宣传“兵部尚书”于谦“立了大功”，虽被英宗杀害，最后终于“恢复名誉”
    《海瑞罢官》出笼以后，吴晗觉得意犹未尽，因此又抬出了一个于谦来。一九六一年六月，他在《明代民族英雄于谦》一文中说：于谦从小就“性格坚强”，作御史时，“明宣宗很赏识他，认为是个了不起的人才”。他说，于谦巡按江西时，“发见有几百件冤枉的案件，都给平反了。”作河南山西巡抚时，“极重视调查研究工作，一上任便骑马到处视察，所到地方都延请当地有年纪的人谈话，了解地方情况，政治上得失利弊，老百姓的负担、痛苦，该办的和不该办的事，一发见问题，立刻提出意见，写报告给皇帝。遇有水灾、旱灾，也及时上报，进行救济。他对地方的情况很清楚，政治上的措施也很及时，因之得到人民的歌颂和支持。”吴晗颂扬于谦“做了九年巡抚，政治清明，威信很高，强盗小偷都四散逃避，老百姓过了比较安定的生活。由于他政治上的成就，明朝政府升他为兵部左侍郎”，后来，又升他为兵部尚书（国防部长——这是吴晗自己加的注）。
    吴晗说“于谦是清官”，“忧国忘身，虽然立了大功，保住了北京城，接还了皇帝，却很谦虚，口不言功”，“日日夜夜为国家操劳”，“过着极清苦的生活。每次入朝，不但不送礼、纳贿，连普通的人事也不送”，因此“老百姓虽然很喜欢，朝廷权贵却恨死他了”。吴晗说：正因为于谦“性格刚直”，对权贵“不肯逢迎”，以致处处遭到权贵“反对”，后来甚至被英宗杀害。没多久，边方又紧急，因为没有了于谦，英宗又后悔了。后来，“于谦的政敌都先后失败”，“于谦的儿子于冕遇赦回家，写信给皇帝申冤，明宪宗恢复了于谦的官位，派人祭奠，祭文中说：‘当国家之多难，保社稷以无虞，惟公道之独持，为权奸所并嫉，在先帝已知其枉，而朕心实怜其忠。’这几句话，传诵一时。于谦的名誉恢复了。明孝宗弘治二年（公元一四八九）谥于谦为肃愍，并建立祠堂，号为旌功。明神宗万历时又改谥忠肃。杭州、开封、山西和北京的人民都建立了他的祠堂，广大人民永远纪念这个保卫北京城的民族英雄，永垂不朽！”
    吴晗认为，于谦正如他自己在《石灰吟》一诗中所说的那样：“不怕烈火焚，不怕粉骨碎身，要留下清白在人间”。
    吴晗在这篇文章的结尾，特别着意渲染：于谦虽然死了，但最后胜利的还是于谦。他说：于谦死后，“广大人民深深悼念于谦，当时不敢指名，作了个歌谣：
    鹭鸶冰上走，何处觅鱼嗛？
    鱼嗛是于谦的谐音，这个民族英雄的形象是永远留在人民的记忆中的。”
    要人们“重温”那些由于“主观主义”、“教条主义”、“陷害”忠良，而“害己、害人、误国的教训”
    一九六二年初，吴晗在《赵括和马谡》一文中说：赵括和马谡，都“吃了主观主义的亏，吃了教条主义的亏，自以为是”，“根据主观愿望、想象去改变客观的实际”，“不顾客观形势，不听有实践经验的人们的劝告，结果是摔了大跟斗”，这个“害己、害人、误国的教训”，“时间虽然隔得很久了，今天来重温这些教训，看来还是有益的。”
    一九六二年七月，吴晗在《〈敕勒歌〉歌唱者家族的命运》一文中，颂扬敕勒部将领斛律金“生性质直”，“善于用兵，具有丰富的军事经验”，颂扬斛律金的儿子斛律光“从青年时代参加军队，从未打过败仗”，“生性节俭，不营财利，杜绝贿赂，门无宾客”。颂扬斛律金的次子斛律羡“生性谨慎梗直，因为家门太贵盛了，不但不骄傲，反而时常忧虑”，结果他们都是由于触犯了“昏庸无能的皇帝”和遭到“小人”的陷害而被杀害。吴晗对他们寄予无限的同情说：“斛律金家族的命运，也代表着封建帝王统治下良将忠臣的命运，统治阶级内部的矛盾，在任何时候都是不可调和的”。
    在《汪辉祖论做州县官》一文中，吴晗宣扬汪辉祖《学治臆说》一书，说这书“主要内容是讲审案和收钱粮的经验”，“有些经验也还有意思”，如“不要倚恃才识，独行其是”，“因地、因时制宜，不要专靠老经验”，“欲资民力，必先为民惜力”。吴晗认为：读这样的书，“可以从中汲取某些有用的东西”。
    （二）反对以马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想作为研究历史的指针
    胡说学术界有一种“宁左勿右”的倾向、“非历史主义的”学风
    从一九五九年开始，我国历史学界出现了史学革命的大好形势，广大史学工作者在党的号召下，对整个历史遗产展开了革命的批判的审查。但这场革命，也引起了吴晗等人的激烈反对，他们的口号就是：“反左”。
    一九六一年，吴晗在《历史教材和历史研究中的几个问题》一文中说：“似乎在历史学界有一种宁左勿右的倾向，右了怕犯错误，左一些问题不大。表现在评价历史人物上，往往贬多于褒，应该肯定的人物不敢肯定，不该否定的人物倒否定了，即使肯定了，也要加上一个小尾巴，以对今人的要求来要求之。”他又说“只从今天的某些政策、方针出发，强迫历史实际服从今天的实际，是非科学的，非历史主义的学风。这个苗头很不对头，……我们必须坚决反对。”
    在《厚今薄古和古为今用》一文中，他说：“片面地是今非古，隔断历史，弄得‘前无古人’，也是不合理，不符合客观实际的”，这“将会使我们的下一代很难了解祖国历史和文学艺术优良传统”。
    认为用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法写历史，就是“对祖国伟大的历史采取虚无主义的态度”
    吴晗对以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法来研究历史表示很反感。一九六二年，他在《论历史知识的普及》一文中说：有人“认为只有用马克思列宁主义的立场、观点、方法写出来的东西才是历史，过去时代并没有马克思列宁主义，而只有封建主义、唯心主义，因此，旧历史是完全不可信的，他们因此对祖国伟大的历史采取虚无主义的态度。”同年，他在另一篇文章中又说：有人“认为现代的历史家应该根据马克思列宁主义的方法，根据自己的想象来写历史，来创造历史。我看，这样的历史家，真是‘历史的创造家’了。”
    吴晗还反对在历史书中引用经典作家的意见。他在《如何学习历史》一文中说：“大家念过《史记》，司马迁在叙事的时候是有他自己的观点的”。“但现在有些人却用马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林的观点来代替，作者自己的看法呢？很抱歉！没有。这样，作者把自己置于写作立场之外了，因而读者只能看到经典作家的意见，却看不到作者的意见了。我们要问，你既然没有意见，为什么要写这么一大堆，浪费纸墨，还浪费了读者的时间！”在一篇《神仙会和百家争鸣》的文章中，他又说：“有少数人当众背书，他很认真，把马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林、毛主席有关的话照抄下来了，并且照着背，一字不错，完全正确。但是，他自己的意见呢？很抱歉，没有。对这问题的看法呢？也还是很抱歉，没有。这样，背了几次，没有鸣，更没有争，垮了。”
    主张先学历史，后学理论。说什么“只要把真正的史实摆清楚，观点自然就出来了”
    吴晗以反对“以论代史”为借口，反对以马克思主义理论、毛泽东思想为指导来研究历史。他说：“论在史之中，不是在史之外”，“只要把真正的史实摆清楚了，观点自然就出来了”。“把很多的史料，不同的记载，提纲挈领地串起来，就可以发现问题，经过认真研究，解决问题。”他把这种观点概括为“论从史出”。
    吴晗还说：“有人问先学理论还是先学历史？我看先学历史后学理论。抓住实际的东西来检验理论，否则理论与谁结合呢？”
    对于史料的真伪问题，他认为：“中国史家有一个据实记事的好传统，即使有杀身之祸也不怕。”他还说：“至于有些人主张‘冲破’历史记载，摧毁封建统治阶级伪造的历史的主张，我的看法是，历史记载是冲不破的，因为这是客观的存在，谁也冲不破。”
    以“权威”的面孔，教训青年，要他们“钻到古书堆里去”
    应该怎样学习历史？吴晗回答说：“要言不繁，答案只有两个字：念书。”他还把这种学习的方法推而广之，说这也就是取得知识的唯一途径，他说：“任何新的知识，取得的途径只有一条，那便是学，向具有这门知识的人学，向记有这门知识的书本学。”
    吴晗向青年们宣传，“任何一个人都可以成为专家学者，问题的关键就在于自己是否努力，是否能克服挡在他面前的一切困难。”怎样克服困难呢？就是要做到“三勤”——“勤读、勤抄、勤写”。他要青年们，“钻到古书堆里去”。他说，“钻进去并没有什么不好”，“为了要继承，就必须要钻进去。应该要有勇气，胆子要大些”。为了提供样板，吴晗还特意介绍了他自己青年时候“钻到浩瀚的明史资料中去”，终于成名成家的“经验”。
    吴晗认为，我国广大史学工作者没有走他指出的这条路，而是响应党的号召到工农兵群众中去，参加社会主义革命运动，参加劳动，因此便搞“糟”了。他讽刺青年教师“参加了很多政治运动”，但是，“书读的不够多，也不够扎实”，“一不老，二未专，三还不成家”。他教训说：你们只有“发愤读书”，“不这样做，浪头越来越大，”“也要象我的孩子那样，要多喝几口海水，甚至被浪头冲倒。”
    （三）反对用无产阶级观点评价历史人物
      借口反对“唯成份论”，反对阶级分析
    吴晗极力反对运用阶级分析的方法来研究历史人物，一九六二年，他在《论历史人物评价》一文中说，马克思主义史学工作者“把阶级分析片面化了，庸俗化了”。他说这是“唯成份论”。他提醒人们“特别注意”：“阶级出身决不是评价历史人物的根本条件”，决不是评价历史人物的“唯一尺度”。“如果光拿阶级成份来评价历史人物，那就糟了，因为这样做的结果，几乎所有卓越的历史人物都要被否定了。”“试问过去的大政治家，哪个不出身于地主阶级”？
    吴晗说，“问题不在于他们的阶级成份”，“主要是要看他们”“比他们的前辈多提供了什么新东西，只要有贡献，有新东西，……就应该肯定，丝毫也不必迟疑。”
    主张评价历史人物要依据“当时当地的标准”，依据当时“大政治家的评论”
    一九五九年十月，吴晗在南开大学科学讨论会上，提出评价历史人物应该依据“当时当地标准”。一九六二年在《论历史人物评价》一文中，又进一步宣扬这种观点，他说：
      “评价历史人物是依据今时今地的标准呢，还是依据当时当地的标准？”“很显然，在评价历史人物的时候，必须把这一人物放在他所处的历史时期，和同代人比，和他的前辈比；而决不可以拿今时今地的条件和道德标准来衡量古人，因为假如这样做，就会把历史搞成漆黑一团，没有一个卓越的可以肯定的历史人物了。”
    在《论历史人物评价》一文中，吴晗还提出了评价历史人物要依据“当时当地大多数人的意见”的论点，他说：“一般地说，凡是在当时历史上起过作用的人物，在当时和后代都会有不同的意见。什么看法才对？主要应该根据当时当地大多数人的意见。”拿武则天做例子，要“根据唐朝大政治家对她的评价”，“研究武则天，要根据唐人对她的意见，要根据直接记载的史料。”
    对于评价海瑞，吴晗说：“海瑞在当时，是得到人民爱戴，为人民所歌颂的”，“难道还不应该为我们所肯定，所歌颂吗？”在《论海瑞》一文里，吴晗大量引证了明朝湖广巡抚梁云龙，翰林院庶吉士王宏诲，吏部办事进士顾允成、彭遵古、诸寿贤，大地主何良俊，首相高拱、张居正等人对海瑞的一些好评。可是吴晗的断语却是：“总的评论是当时的人民说他好，当时的大地主说他不好。”
    硬说指出古人有局限性，“不是合于原则的”
    对历史人物，吴晗反对指出他们的局限性。他说：“在许多教科书和传记上，也往往在肯定了这个人物之后，笔锋一转，说可惜呀可惜，这个人可惜生在那个时代，为那个时代所局限，有了局限性云云。其实哪个时代的人没有局限性呢，我们这个时代的人又何尝没有局限性呢？苏联的加加林、季托夫上了天，我们现在还不能，这不是局限性？这三年来遭受了连续的灾荒，虽然由于有了三面红旗，大大减轻了自然灾害的严重性，但是，毕竟我们现在还不能制服自然呀，这不是局限性？我们自己在这个工作，那个工作中，由于理论水平低，实践经验少经常犯错误，这不是局限性？应该明确，局限性不限于古人，是任何时代人都有的，不只是我们自己有局限性，将来的人还会有，拿这个来要求、批评古人，我看并不是合于原则的。”
    他又说：“例如某些人对历史人物，除了农民战争的领袖以外，大部分都采取否定态度。或者虽然加以肯定，但是在结论又千篇一律地加上‘限于时代局限性，没有能做后来的人所做的事’云云。……千篇一律的论述，不能不使年青的读者感到厌烦、沉闷，只好束书不读了。”
    （四）美化帝王将相，丑化劳动人民
      指责许多历史教材“特别强调农民起义”，使祖国历史“漆黑一团”
    吴晗说：“在许多种教材中，都强调农民起义，农民战争”。他对此很不满意，理由是：“第一，只写农民起义的一面，不写或少写农民所反对的一面，这样一来，阶级斗争几乎只剩下一面了”；“第二，由于特别强调农民起义，势必压缩其他方面的叙述，农民起义史有代替中国通史的趋势”“第三，要强调农民起义的正义性，就非相对地刻划封建统治阶级的罪恶活动不可，……于是，历史上的光明面丧失了，写在书上的尽是这个皇朝如何坏，农民起义推翻了它，另一皇朝起来了，又如何坏，农民起义又推翻了它，一片打倒声，历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的。”
    吴晗还强调说：“不能因为他这个人是皇帝、是国王、是宰相、是将军，他的阶级成份不好，就不承认他在历史上的贡献；也不能因为说这个人成份很好，一无所有，贫雇农出身，可是他一辈子没有什么成就，也把他写在历史上，这样，历史就太多了，读不胜读了，也就取消了历史了。”
    认为帝王将相在历史上“起主导作用”，盛世的帝王将相代表“历史上的光明面”
    吴晗认为，在历史上起“主导作用”的是帝王将相，应该“大胆肯定”。他说：“在过去的历史时代里，在某项政治措施、工程建设或大规模的战争里，起主导作用的是谁？是历史上的帝王将相领导、指挥了这些工作。……对这样的人应该肯定、表扬、歌颂。”他说：“一部人类社会的发展史，也就是敢想敢说敢做的人们的历史。”“思想要解放，对于该肯定的人物要敢于大胆肯定，不要因为他们是帝王将相或地主阶级出身的人物，就不敢肯定。”
    吴晗说：“并不是如有人所说的，一部二十四史都是人吃人的时代，应该说历史上曾经有过黑暗时代，也曾经有过光明的时代。光讲一面，是不全面的。”什么是历史上的光明面？吴晗认为就是盛世的帝王将相，他对有的历史教材中没有歌颂帝王将相，很不满意，他说：“教材的编写人看来极力想避免对帝王将相的歌颂，以免丧失立场，结果除秦始皇而外，对象汉武、唐宗、康熙、乾隆等这样比较全盛的时代的领导人物不写或很少描写，于是，历史上的光明面丧失了。”“也正由于历史上的光明面写得少了，黑暗面多了一些，我曾问过孩子们的意见，他们说尽是这个坏，那个坏，要爱祖国的历史，怎样也爱不起来！”他指责说：“我们还有形式主义的残余，把个人在历史上的作用理解得过于片面了。不敢写某些帝王将相，不敢写当时的领导人在历史上的作用，或者不敢写个人、特别是地主阶级分子个人在历史上的作用。”他强调：“不能一见历史上的奴隶主、封建主、资产阶级等等，就喊打倒。笼统地喊打倒，是打不倒的。”他质问道：“把我们的祖宗全说成是坏人，祖国的历史漆黑一团，我们全是坏人的子孙，我们的历史只是今天才从头开始，把历史切断了，这有什么好处呢？”
    歌颂曹操是“第一流的政治家”，“对当时人民有很大功绩”
    在《谈曹操》、《从曹操问题的讨论谈历史人物评价问题》等文中，吴晗歌颂曹操是中国的“第一流的政治家”、“第一流的军事家”、“第一流的文学家”、“第一流的诗人”。他说曹操
  “对当时人民有很大功绩”；说曹操的一生是“奋斗的一生”，“战斗的一生”。他认为，曹操“压抑豪强，反对和削弱大地主的力量，但是他的政权还是建立在中小地主的基础上”的。他百般美化曹操，说曹操“从反对董卓，到挟天子以令诸侯、打击豪门贵族，做了许多对人民有利的事”。“在他所统一的地区做了不少好事”，曹操的屯田制“增加了生产，减轻了农民的负担，节省了农民远道运输的劳力，百姓比以前富足了”。他说曹操“喜爱文学和文学家，建安文学在中国历史上有着光辉的地位。”“他喜欢音乐，善草书，是个艺术家。又喜欢打猎，有武艺，是一个好运动员。”他还颂扬曹操“用人唯才，不问家世，用有才干的人管机密，作郡国守相”，“有意识地反抗汉末说空话的风气，几次下令求贤，提到不管什么生活不检点的，即使偷窃、盗嫂的都可以用”。
    他更歌颂曹操“统一”的功劳，说“曹操的局部统一，为后来晋的统一打下基础，我们现在祖国的大统一局面，如果没有我们祖先的辛勤努力也是不可想象的”。
    歌颂武则天是“历史上最伟大的妇女”，说她取得了人民的“支持”和“爱戴”
    一九五九年十月，吴晗在《历史的真实和艺术的真实》，《关于评价历史人物的一些初步意见》等文中，对武则天极力歌颂，说武则天是“伟大的政治家”，“一个了不起的人物”，
  “是丰富多采的、复杂的，又是伟大的”，“是个承先启后的人物，是个历史上关键性的人物”。“中国几千年的历史，在她统治时期就占了五十年”。他说，当时唐朝的文化、生产发展，“其关键主要是武则天这五十年”。“在她的统治的年代里，人才辈出，培养了很多政治家”，“武则天眼光远大，把国家看成是一个整体，用人从全国范围出发，从才力出发，选举制度和不次用人相结合，在这一点上，她是很了不起的，她是一个杰出的政治家”。武则天为什么能长期掌握政权，吴晗认为，“是她取得了中小地主的支持，取得人民的支持”。一九六○年，吴晗在《谈武则天》一文中，更进一步发挥了他的论点，他论证说：“不说别的，单说她在位时期，文献上还没有发现大规模农民起义的记载这一点来看，和历史上任何王朝，任何封建统治者统治时期是有所区别的。这一点说明当时的人民是支持她、爱戴她的。”吴晗认为，武则天对她自己的自我评价所说的话，如“忧劳天下”、“天下安佚，朕所养也”、“不敢爱身而知爱人”等，都“确如李卓吾所批的都是真话”。吴晗特别强调地说：“我们应该说，武则天不止是一个伟大的政治家，同时她还是历史上最伟大的妇女！她的一生是战斗的一生！”
    颂扬朱元璋的封建王朝为民“兴利”“除害”，“对大地主进行了长期的斗争”
    一九六五年，吴晗出版了新版《朱元璋传》。这本书不仅颂扬朱元璋是“卓越的人物”，“优秀的军事家”，“勇敢、能干、大方、有见识，讲义气，人缘好”等等，而且还说朱元璋的封建王朝，为农民“兴利”、“除害”，“对一部分大地主进行了严重的斗争，对广大农民作了一些必要的让步，一部分大地主被消灭了，一部分大地主的力量削弱了，农民生产的积极性增加了”。“朱元璋斗争的对象是地主阶级中违法的大地主，办法有两条，一条是用严刑重法消灭‘奸顽豪富之家’；一条是整理地籍和户口”。他说，大地主“隐匿田地”，“逃避皇朝赋役”，“朱元璋抓住这中心问题，对大地主进行了长期的斗争”。那么朱元璋的政权到底依靠谁来支持呢？他说，“答案很清楚，朱家政权的支柱是广大的中小地主和富农”。
    在这本书中，吴晗还强调说，朱元璋其所以蜕化变质为地主阶级的代表，是由于农民的“阶级本质决定的”。
    宣扬封建统治阶级中有不少“清官”，说他们为人民“有意识地办了一些好事”
    吴晗在许多文章中，对“清官”极尽美化之能事。他替“清官”列出了一大堆“功劳”：“爱民如子”、“为民作主”、“为民除害”、“清理冤狱”、“抑制豪强”、“惩办贪污”，等等，不一而足。
    在《况钟和周忱》一文中，他说：“封建时代的官僚，被人民表扬为青天，是很不容易的事。”“也正由于封建时代的青天极少，所以历史上屈指可数的几个青天，也就成为箭垛式的人物，许多人民理想中的好事都被堆砌到他们身上了。”他又说：
  “广大人民”“对于能够采取一些措施，减轻人民负担，伸雪人民冤枉的好官”是“拥护”的，所以，“对于这样的好官，人民作了鉴定，叫作青天”。
    他论证道：由于清官的“出身和其他关系，比较接近人民，了解人民的痛苦，比较正直，有远见，为了维持封建统治阶级的长远利益，缓和阶级矛盾，在不损害封建统治阶级的根本利益前提下，有意识地办了一些好事。这些好事是和封建统治阶级的长远利益一致的，也是和被压迫被剥削的广大人民当前利益一致的，对当时的生产发展，对历史的进展有好处的”。
    他在《论海瑞》中说，海瑞为代表的这些“清官”，“在历史上是有地位的”。
    接着，他写道：“这样的历史人物，从今天来说，建设社会主义的新时代，该不该肯定，该不该歌颂？答案是应该肯定，应该歌颂。”
    （五）贩卖地主资产阶级的道德
    否认劳动人民有自己的道德，说“所谓阶级的道德也就是统治阶级的道德”
    一九六二年，吴晗又制造出一套所谓“封建道德继承论”，拼命贩售地主资产阶级道德。
    吴晗说，只有统治阶级才有道德，被统治阶级、劳动人民是没有自己的道德的。在《说道德》一文中，他说：“所谓阶级的道德也就是统治阶级的道德，……这是因为：‘支配着物质生产资料的阶级，同时也支配着精神生产的资料，因此，那些没有精神生产资料的人的思想，一般地是受统治阶级支配的。’（马克思、恩格斯：《德意志意识形态》《马克思恩格斯全集》第三卷，第五十二页）这样，统治阶级的道德论在一般情况下，也就成为被统治阶级的道德论，巩固统治阶级的统治了。”
    当这一观点受到批评以后，在《三说道德》中，他又强辩说：“‘所谓阶级的道德也就是统治阶级的道德’，这句话没有说全，尽管下文在引了马克思、恩格斯《德意志意识形态》一段以后，我说：‘这样，统治阶级的道德在一般情况下，也就成为被统治阶级的道德论，巩固统治阶级的统治了。’说是‘在一般情况下’，不是一切情况下，比较清楚了。但是和上文一对照，便显得‘所谓阶级的道德也就是统治阶级的道德’这句话的片面性，……这句话的正确说法，应该是‘所谓阶级的道德，在一般情况下，也就是统治阶级的道德。’这样说，便不致引起误会，以为在历史上只有统治阶级的道德，被统治阶级的道德并不存在的不符合历史实际的论点了。”
    在谈到统治阶级道德和被统治阶级道德之间的关系时，吴晗又说：“被统治阶级的某些美德，不但曾经表现在统治阶级某些个别人物的活动中，而且，概括地说，在理论上也迫使统治阶级不能不接受，作为自己阶级的美德。”
    认为无产阶级不能“凭空创造”自己的道德，必须“吸取”过去统治阶级的“优良品德”
    吴晗认为，无产阶级不能“凭空创造”自己的道德。在《再说道德》一文中他说：“无产阶级若不善于吸取过去统治阶级某些优良的东西，甚至完全摒弃，那末，看来只有向古代的无产阶级继承，或者自己来凭空创造了。问题是在古代，无产阶级并不存在；自己凭空创造呢，也不大可能。”在《再谈历史剧》一文中，他强调说：“要使历史上某些有益的经验教训，某些人物的优良品德，特别是我们祖先艰苦朴素，英勇斗争，富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈的英雄气概，深入人心，成为社会主义共产主义道德的组成部分”。在《吴晗同志谈历史剧》一文中，他又说：“过去的某些时代精神有助于今天的需要，可以成为我们社会主义道德的一个部分。”在《春天集》序中，他还说：“这两年我把主要力量放在写历史人物上”，“希望通过历史人物的介绍，让广大人民了解自己祖国的历史，学习我们伟大先人的榜样，从他们勤劳、智慧、勇敢的美德中，吸取精神力量，斗志昂扬地建设我们伟大的祖国”。
    硬要无产阶级继承“忠孝节义”、“礼义廉耻”等封建道德
    吴晗认为，一整套的封建道德，无产阶级都应该继承。在《学习历史知识的几个问题》一文中，他说：“例如，忠孝节义，礼义廉耻，这些道德观念是为过去的统治阶级服务的，但也可以把它改造，使它为社会主义服务。‘忠君’是过去的道德观念，除了个别遗老外，今天没有人讲忠君了，是不是连带这个‘忠’字也应该否定呢？我看不应该。难道我们不应该忠于祖国、忠于党、忠于社会主义事业？孝也是一样，今天我们来提倡过去二十四孝那样的孝，那是错误的，但是父母抚育我们成人，现在他们老了，难道我们要象英、美资产阶级那样，父母到儿女家吃一顿饭还要付钱？我们不是资产阶级，对父母还是应该有孝心，父母年老了，照顾父母，尊重和帮助父母是应该的。节，封建道德观念认为死了丈夫妻子不能改嫁，甚至应该上吊，这是要不得的，应该完全否定。但是，把节理解为有骨气，例如文天祥说的‘时穷节乃见’，这样的节，难道不应该继承吗？（按：最初在一九六二年第七期《新闻业务》发表时，没有“但是，把节理解为有骨气，例如文天祥说的‘时穷节乃见’，这样的节，难道不应该继承吗？”这一句。这些话是在收入《学习集》时补加的）义，朋友之间互相帮助，彼此爱护，互相批评，这不是很应该吗？礼义廉耻中的礼，今天还是要的，人与人之间不能一点礼貌也没有，光着身子进电影院是不对的。有些青年人，不修边幅，头发留得好长，衣服脏极了，臭烘烘的，据说这样才叫‘朴素’，这恐怕是缺乏礼的教育所致吧。廉，要不要廉洁？要不要爱护国家财物？……耻，不好的事不要去做。旧时代的这些道德，我看都应该批判地继承应用于今天。（按：在《新闻业务》发表时，没有“批判地继承”这几个字。这是在收入《学习集》时补加的）”
    在《说道德》一文中，他说：“问题是封建社会的道德论的某些部分，有没有值得今人吸取的地方？（按：“有没有值得今人吸取的地方”这句话，在收入《学习集》时，改为“有没有值得今人批判地继承的地方？”）我以为是有的。”“至于诚实、勤劳、勇敢、刻苦耐劳、雄心壮志这些美德，难道不都可以移用在今天？”在《再说道德》一文中，吴晗说：孟子“认为大丈夫的标准应该是个这样的人：富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈。这是封建时代的道德，也是我们中华民族的光辉传统，在古代历史上曾经有过这样标准的无数伟大人物，在近、现代的革命史中，也出现过符合这个标准的无数烈士和英雄人物”。“在环境特别困难时，在是和非，忠和逆，正义和不义的抉择中，这些历史人物（包括文天祥在内）都牺牲或者敢于牺牲自己的生命，保持了孟子所说的大丈夫的品德。这些人物虽然都是地主，都是官僚，但是，在和恶势力斗争中，他们却都是大丈夫。”“从这些封建时代的言论和人物的表现中，对照我们无产阶级的道德标准，不是可以看到道德是可以批判地继承么！”在《三说道德》中，吴晗还说：“宋朝的司马光在政治上是保守的，却是一个诚实的人”。“历史上有不少著名的政治家是以勤劳著称的。刻苦耐劳、雄心壮志的人更多得很。”
    认为资产阶级的“精打细算，多方赚钱”，“自由，民主”等等，无产阶级也要继承
    吴晗认为，资产阶级的道德，无产阶级也要继承。在《说道德》一文中，他说：“不止是封建道德，就是资产阶级的道德，精打细算，多方赚钱，难道不应该成为社会主义经营管理企业的一条重要原则？”
    他说：“由此看来，道德是阶级的道德，道德是随着阶级统治的改变而改变的。但是，也还有另一面，那就是无论是封建道德，还是资产阶级道德，无产阶级都可以吸取其中某些部分，（按：这句话在收入《学习集》时，改为“无产阶级都可以批判地吸取其中某些部分”）使之起本质的变化，从而为无产阶级的政治、生产服务。”“以今人的道德水准去衡量古人，以为古人一无足取，没有值得批判继承的东西，看来也是不正确的。”
    在《三说道德》中，他又说：“例如民主、自由这两个概念”，
  “自从有了无产阶级之后，有了马列主义之后，建立了社会主义国家之后，民主和自由这两个概念是不是批判地继承下来呢？我们也讲民主，不过讲的是人民的民主，……自由也是如此，……由此看来，民主和自由的内容随着阶级关系的变化而起着本质的变化了。这可不可以叫作批判的继承呢？”
    （六）企图使历史剧成为宣扬封建毒素和进行反党、反社会主义活动的工具
    认为“历史剧的目的，是要今人学习、吸收古人的某些好的品质”
    在吴晗谈历史剧的一些文章中，他强调要多写历史剧。在《再谈历史剧》一文中，他说：“戏剧的作用是远远超过书本的。……要使历史上某些有益的经验教训，某些人物的优良品德，特别是我们祖先艰苦朴素，英勇斗争，富贵不能淫，贫贱不能移，威武不能屈的英雄气概，深入人心，成为社会主义共产主义道德的组成部分，历史剧是有其重要作用和意义的。”“历史剧的目的，是要今人学习、吸收古人的某些好的品质”。
    在《谈历史剧》一文中，吴晗写道：“历史剧的任务是反映历史的实际情况，吸取其中某些有益经验，对广大人民进行历史主义爱国主义教育。”“在过去的年代里，工人、农民没有受教育的机会，但也知道有汉，有唐，有诸葛亮、包公等等历史人物，这些知识主要是从历史剧得来的。”“……今天，应该有我们这个时代的历史剧，来对广大人民进行历史主义、爱国主义的教育。”
    吴晗特别强调历史剧的“古为今用”问题。在《关于历史剧的一些问题》一文中，他说：“无论是历史书也吧，历史剧也吧，里面的历史人物决不是僵尸的复活，写这个人、演这个人，都要着眼于他或她的某个方面对于后一代的人们的启发作用，也就是前人经验的总结。一句话，不是为了死人，而是为活人服务，也就是为了继承前人的斗争经验教训，使之为今天的社会主义建设服务，作到古为今用，这两者是统一的，不容有任何怀疑的。”
    认为历史剧要受“历史真实性的约束”，对古人“不需要又歌颂，又批判”
    吴晗特别强调历史剧要受“历史真实性的约束”，“反对主观的想象、创造，反对基本上不符合历史实际情况的所谓‘历史剧’”。他所说的“历史真实”是什么呢？他说：“写历史剧，我的看法，主要人物，主要情节，包括人物性格，应该符合历史真实。包公、海瑞，人民群众都知道他们是好人，如果把他们写成坏蛋，观众就不会答应，因为违反了历史真实。”但是他又认为，对于“好人”，就不需要写缺点，不需要批判。他说：“我以为有权利选取这个历史人物某一段活动或者是其中某一件史实，突出地加以渲染、表现，不一定非要在指出优点的同时，逐一指出那几项缺点不可。”“写唐太宗、武则天，是否必要又写他（她）好，又写他（她）坏？”他认为剧作家“可以不这样做”，“不需要又歌颂、又批判。要不然，就会在观众中造成混乱，分不出这是好人，是坏人，还是半个好人、半个坏人，教育意义也就不完全了。这就是分寸”。“分寸就是历史主义”。
    吴晗还强调说：“把历史人物放在他所处的历史时代去描写，就会表现出当时的时代精神”。他认为“历史剧所要体现的时代精神，是指它所表现的那个时代的时代精神，而不是今天的时代精神”。
    反对把统治者写成“窝窝囊囊”的人物
    吴晗所强调的“历史真实”，就是主张在历史剧中，要突出帝王将相的作用，而不要突出人民群众的作用。他说：“怎样看待历史剧中的帝王将相？这就要有历史观点，要具体分析，要从历史发展和历史实际出发来分析。……一方面应该充分认识人民群众的力量，一方面也要如实地估计某些帝王将相——当时领导人的作用。他们的确做过很多坏事，但也做过好事。比如唐太宗、武则天都在当时起过很大作用。不能因为他们是帝王，就否定他们，这是非历史主义的。”他批评有些历史剧“在写历史上统治阶级人物时，不敢写他们的才能本事，他们任何好的措施都只能是老百姓出的主意，而统治者本人是拿不出什么办法来的”，结果把统治者都写成了“窝窝囊囊”的人物，“只能由老百姓牵着鼻子走”，这“不尽符合历史事实”，“降低了历史剧的教育意义”。他反对在历史剧中“抬出人民群众来”，指责现在有一些历史剧都“不适当地强调人民群众的作用，一大群人民群众上了台，就算表现了人民群众的力量，不敢写统治者在历史上的作用。这恐怕就把人民群众创造历史的观点庸俗化了”。
    他对旧历史剧，“一点反对的意思也没有”
    在历史剧问题上，吴晗特别声明，他所反对的是“不尽符合历史真实”的新历史剧，而不是反对旧历史剧。他说：“对旧历史剧，我一点反对的意思也没有。”“旧历史剧和新历史剧应该区别对待，不能拿今天的要求去要求旧历史剧。那样要求是不公道、不实际的，而且会引起混乱。为什么？因为旧时代的剧作家没有马克思列宁主义嘛，对历史的认识也不完全和我们一样，对历史和历史剧的区别和联系也不是很理解，因此，旧历史剧有不少缺点，不能完全符合今天的要求，是必然的。可是另一面呢，这些旧历史剧已经上演几十年、几百年了，已经为人民群众喜闻乐见，所以也不应该反对它，不必去改动它。”
