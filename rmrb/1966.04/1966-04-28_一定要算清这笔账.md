    After reading the materials in the "People's Daily" exposing and criticizing Wu Han, I have further recognized Wu Han's reactionary words and deeds of opposing the Party and socialism. I will never tolerate it, and I must fight him to the end.

    In the past, I did not understand Wu Han. In this great debate, I realized that Wu Han was a thorough and complete bourgeois agent. For decades, he has consistently stood on the anti-communist and anti-people's stance, truly worthy of being a loyal lackey of the bourgeoisie.

    When viewing problems, one must look at the present from the perspective of history, and look at the performance in the present. By linking Wu Han's past and present together, one can clearly see Wu Han's true face.

    As early as the 1930s, Wu Han bowed down to Hu Shi, the running dog of imperialism. At that time, all Chinese people with a sense of justice threw themselves into the vigorous anti-Japanese national salvation movement. But Wu Han closed his eyes and ears, closed the door and "studied diligently," disregarding the survival and safety of the country, and instead vigorously promoted his mentor Hu Shi's reactionary theory of "saving the country through reading," attempting to stop the people's patriotic movement. When Chiang Kai-shek launched the counter-revolutionary civil war, Wu Han unscrupulously made suggestions for Chiang Kai-shek. All this shows that Wu Han's past history is a history of catering to the counter-revolutionary needs of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek.

    Although Wu Han did a lot of things that harmed the Party and the people in the past, our great Party and people are magnanimous and welcome him to stand on the side of the people and make revolution. Therefore, after liberation, the Party and the people gave Wu Han a fairly high status and treatment, both politically and in life. The Party and the people have been benevolent and righteous to him. But what about Wu Han? Not only did he "not repay kindness with gratitude," but he also "returned kindness with enmity." In the sixteen years since liberation, he stubbornly refused ideological reform and still insisted on his bourgeois stance and ideology, confronting the Party and the people. In the guise of a "historian" and "history professor," under the banner of "historical research," he viciously attacked the Party and socialism. Especially around the time of the Party's Lushan Conference, Wu Han successively threw out a series of articles such as "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor," "On Hai Rui," and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," first opening the way, cheering and drumming for the right-leaning opportunists, and then shouting injustices and boosting morale for the right-leaning opportunists who had been dismissed from "office."

    In the 1960s, Wu Han is still "his body in Cao Ying, but his heart is with Han," his body in socialism, but his heart in capitalism. This is not surprising, as it is determined by his class nature. Now, Wu Han refuses to admit his crime even when caught red-handed, and still wants to quibble in the face of the facts. However, history is the best witness, and Wu Han will not be able to get away with it. We must settle this debt with Wu Han, and we will never give up until it is settled clearly.

    一定要算清这笔账	解放军某部　高先乐
    我看了《人民日报》上揭露和批判吴晗的材料后，进一步认清了吴晗反党、反社会主义的反动言行，我决不能容忍，一定要同他斗争到底。
    过去，我对 不了解。在这次大论战中，我才认识到原来吴晗是一个地地道道的资产阶级代理人。几十年来，他一贯站在反共、反人民的立场，真不愧为资产阶级的一名忠实走卒。
    看问题要从历史看现时，现时看表现。把吴晗的过去和现在联系起来看，就可以看清楚吴晗的真面目。
    早在三十年代，吴晗就拜倒在帝国主义的走狗胡适脚下。那时，凡是有正义感的中国人，都投入了轰轰烈烈的抗日救亡运动。而吴晗却闭眼塞耳，掩门“攻读”，对国家存亡安危置之不顾，反而大肆宣扬其恩师胡适“读书救国”的反动理论，企图阻止人民的爱国运动。在蒋介石发动反革命内战的时候，吴晗又不择手段地为蒋介石出谋划策。这一切说明，吴晗过去的历史是一部迎合帝国主义和蒋介石反革命需要的历史。
    尽管吴晗过去做了不少损害党和人民的事，但是我们伟大的党和人民是宽宏大量的，欢迎他站到人民这一边来革命。因此解放后，无论在政治地位上或生活上，党和人民都给了吴晗相当高的待遇。党和人民对他是仁至义尽了。但吴晗又是怎么样呢？他不但“不以德报恩”，反而“恩将仇报”。解放十六年来，他顽固不化地拒绝思想改造，仍然坚持他的资产阶级的立场和思想，与党和人民相对抗。他以“史学家”、“史学教授”的身份，打着“研究历史”的招牌，恶毒地攻击党和社会主义。特别是在党的庐山会议前后，吴晗更接连抛出《海瑞骂皇帝》、《论海瑞》和《海瑞罢官》等一系列的文章，先为右倾机会主义分子鸣锣开道，呐喊助威，接着替被罢了“官”的右倾机会主义分子喊冤叫屈，加油打气。
    在六十年代的今天，吴晗仍然“身在曹营心在汉”，身在社会主义，心在资本主义。这并不奇怪，这是他的阶级本性所决定的。现在，吴晗做了贼不认赃，在事实面前还想狡辩。但是，历史最能作证，吴晗想混过关是不行的。我们一定要和吴晗算清这笔账，不算清楚决不罢休。
