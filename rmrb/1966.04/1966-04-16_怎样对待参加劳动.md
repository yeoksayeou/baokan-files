    How to Treat Participation in Labor
    Among some leading cadres of county Party committees, there is a saying: Leaders only need to lead the way correctly and encourage the masses to work; the leader's responsibility is to check and supervise from time to time, so that the masses work harder.
    I think this statement is wrong and harmful. Because these comrades have this understanding, they think that they do not need to go deep into the grassroots level, and they do not need to participate in physical labor. This shows that there is still a big distance between these leading cadres and the masses, and they have not yet obtained the qualifications of ordinary laborers. If the space for proletarian ideology in a revolutionary's mind gradually becomes smaller, the ideology of the bourgeoisie will gradually increase. This is clearly manifested in participating in labor.
    Therefore, leading cadres of county Party committees should regard participating in collective labor as an important way for revolutionary cadres to carry out self-ideological reform and highlight politics.

    怎样对待参加劳动
    在一些县委领导干部中有一种论调：领导者，只要领对了路，鼓舞群众去干就行了；领导者的责任就是到时候检查检查，督促督促，使群众劲上加劲。
    我认为这种说法是不对的，有害的。这些同志因为有这种认识，就认为自己没有必要深入基层，没有必要参加体力劳动。这说明，这些领导干部和群众之间还有一个很大的距离，他们还没有取得普通劳动者的资格。一个革命者头脑中若是无产阶级思想的地盘渐渐小了，资产阶级的思想就要渐渐增多。这在参加劳动上也就明白地表现出来。
    因此，县委领导干部参加集体劳动，应该当成是革命干部进行自我思想改造、突出政治的一条重要途径。
