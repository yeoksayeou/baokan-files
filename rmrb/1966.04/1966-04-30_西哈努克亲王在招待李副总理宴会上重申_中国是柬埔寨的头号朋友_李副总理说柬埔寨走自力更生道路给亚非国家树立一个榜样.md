    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 28th – At a banquet in Phnom Penh on the evening of April 27th, Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk, in honor of Chinese Vice Premier Li Xiannian, delivered a speech reiterating that China is Cambodia's number one friend.
    He said that China is "an example for all Asian and African countries striving forward through self-reliance."
    In discussing Cambodia's adherence to the anti-American struggle, he pointed out: "Since the end of 1965, we have paid a greater price in blood for the struggle of the people of Asian countries against American imperialism. However, we are proud that, precisely because of this, we have pointed out the correct path to those who are willing to make shameful compromises or are blinded by the US dollar." He said, "As for us, we will never yield to the imperialists and neo-colonialists, nor to their threats and pressures. Of course, we will always remain faithful to our policy of neutrality, opposing military treaties and the establishment of foreign military bases on our territory, and not participating in external conflicts. But, in order to free Asia from Anglo-American imperialism, to free our Indochina from American interference, and especially to satisfy the legitimate demands of Vietnam, we will continue to struggle unceasingly. I want to point out that this is: the unconditional withdrawal of the American aggressor troops, along with its allies and lackeys, the freedom of self-determination for the people of South Vietnam, and the reunification of Vietnam without foreign interference.”
    Prince Sihanouk said: "Cambodia stands in complete solidarity with the People’s Republic of China, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, which are waging an irreconcilable struggle against the American imperialists, as well as with all the countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. I want to particularly commend the unbreakable fraternal bond that unites us with China in this just struggle."
    He continued: "I can assure you that we will always remain true to these ideals and never abandon them; no matter what price we may have to pay, we will never abandon our policies. Our common struggle is too important for anything else, because we know that this is a matter related to our independence and the future of our generations."
    In his speech, Vice Premier Li Xiannian said: After refusing "US aid," the Kingdom of Cambodia resolutely embarked on the road of self-reliance, thereby safeguarding Cambodia's independence and sovereignty, and enabling better development in all aspects of national construction. This principle of self-reliance embodies the interests and aspirations of the Cambodian people and sets a good example for Asian and African countries. He spoke of Prince Sihanouk's significant contributions to the development of Sino-Cambodian friendship over the past decade and pointed out: "Just now, Prince Sihanouk mentioned China's assistance. Due to our limited economic strength, China's assistance to Cambodia is far from enough, and there are still many shortcomings in our work; we hope that the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia and our Cambodian friends will offer us criticisms and suggestions." He emphasized: "We always believe that assistance is always mutual. On behalf of the Chinese government and people, I express my heartfelt gratitude to Prince Sihanouk and the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia for their strong support in the political, diplomatic, and other aspects of our struggle against American imperialism."
    Vice Premier Li Xiannian pointed out that Cambodia resolutely repelled the various invasions and provocations of American imperialism and its Thai and South Vietnamese running dogs, greatly diminishing the prestige of the aggressors and achieving victory. He said: "The Kingdom of Cambodia and the Cambodian people have consistently supported the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against American aggression and for national salvation. Recently, the government of the Kingdom of Cambodia has made positive efforts to promote the joint struggle of the people of Indochina. In this regard, we want to convey to you the high praise and resolute support of the Chinese government and people. It can be affirmed with certainty that, in the face of the powerful united struggle of the people of Indochina and the people of other countries in the world, American imperialism, which is already in trouble, is accelerating towards its demise."
    The speeches of Prince Sihanouk and Vice Premier Li Xiannian were repeatedly greeted with warm applause.
    The banquet was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere.
    On the Cambodian side, those attending the banquet included: Mrs. Monique Sihanouk, Director of the Office of the Head of State, Chau Sau and his wife, Director of the Press Office of the Head of State, Mey Kanh and his wife.
    Vice Director of the Chinese Commission for Economic Relations with Foreign Countries, Wang Daohan, and other accompanying personnel of Vice Premier Li Xiannian were invited to attend the banquet. Tran Buu Kiem, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front currently visiting Cambodia, Le Van Huan, Deputy Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, and Nguyen Thuy Vu, Deputy Head of the Delegation of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam to Cambodia, were also invited to attend the banquet.
    Chinese Ambassador Chen Shuliang and his wife, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy Zheng Sixiong and his wife, and Economic Counselor Yan Peide and his wife were also invited to attend the banquet.
    Before the banquet, Prince Sihanouk and his wife received Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Director Wang Daohan, and held cordial and friendly talks with them. After the banquet, Prince Sihanouk invited Vice Premier Li Xiannian and his entourage to watch a performance of the arts.

    西哈努克亲王在招待李副总理宴会上重申
    中国是柬埔寨的头号朋友
    李副总理说柬埔寨走自力更生道路给亚非国家树立一个榜样
    新华社金边二十八日电　柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十七日晚上在金边招待中国副总理李先念的宴会上发表讲话，重申中国是柬埔寨的头号朋友。
    他说：中国是“自力更生向前迈进的所有亚非国家的典范”。
    他在谈到柬埔寨坚持反美斗争时指出：“自从一九六五年年底以来，我们对亚洲各国人民的反对美帝国主义的斗争付出了更大的血的代价。然而我们引以自豪的是，正因为如此，我们向那些甘愿作可耻的妥协或者是让美元迷了心窍的人们指出了正确的道路。”他说，“至于我们，我们决不会向帝国主义者和新殖民主义者以及他们的威胁和压力屈服。当然，我们始终忠实于我国的中立政策，反对军事条约和在我国领土上建立外国军事基地，并且不参与外部冲突。但是，为了使亚洲摆脱英美帝国主义，为了使我们印度支那不再受美国干涉，特别是为了使越南的正当要求得到满足，我们将继续不断地进行斗争。我要指出，这就是：美国以及它的盟友和仆从的侵略军无条件地撤走，南越人民的自由决定权和越南在没有外国干涉的情况下重新统一。”
    西哈努克亲王说：“柬埔寨和正在同美帝国主义者进行不调和的斗争的中华人民共和国、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、越南民主共和国、越南南方民族解放阵线以及同所有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家完全团结一致。我要特别赞扬在这场正义斗争中把我们同中国联结在一起的亲如兄弟的牢不可破的联系。”
    他接着说：“我可以向你保证，我们永远忠于这些理想，决不离弃这些理想；不管我们可能要付出怎样的代价，我们决不放弃我们的政策。我们的共同斗争是太重大的事情，所以非那样做不可，因为我们知道，这是同我们的独立和我们世世代代的前途有关的问题。”
    李先念副总理在讲话中说：柬埔寨王国在拒绝“美援”以后，坚决走上了自力更生的道路，因而捍卫了柬埔寨的独立和主权，并且使国家建设的各个方面都得到了更好的发展。这种自力更生的原则体现了柬埔寨人民的利益和愿望，并且给亚非国家树立了一个良好的榜样。他谈到西哈努克亲王十年来对中柬友谊的发展所作出的重大贡献，并且指出：“刚才西哈努克亲王谈到中国的援助。由于我们的经济力量有限，我国给柬埔寨的援助是远远不够的，而且在我们的工作中还有许多缺点；我们希望柬埔寨王国政府和柬埔寨朋友们给我们提出批评和意见。”他强调说：“我们始终认为，援助总是相互的。我代表中国政府和人民，向西哈努克亲王和柬埔寨王国政府表示衷心的感谢，感谢在政治、外交和其他方面对我国反对美帝国主义斗争的有力支持。”
    李先念副总理指出，柬埔寨坚决地回击了美帝国主义及其泰国和南越走狗的各次侵犯和挑衅，大煞侵略者的威风，并且取得了胜利。他说：“柬埔寨王国和柬埔寨人民一贯支持越南人民的抗美救国正义斗争。最近，柬埔寨王国政府为促进印度支那各国人民的联合斗争作出了积极的努力。在这方面，我们要向你转达中国政府和人民的高度评价和坚决支持。可以确信并且断言，在印度支那各国人民和世界其他国家人民的强大联合斗争面前，已经陷入困境的美帝国主义正在加速走向灭亡。”
    西哈努克亲王和李先念副总理的讲话一再受到热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    宴会是在热烈、友好的气氛中举行的。
    柬埔寨方面出席宴会的有：莫尼克·西哈努克夫人，国家元首办公室主任肖桑和夫人，国家元首新闻处主任梅耶和夫人。
    中国对外经济联络委员会副主任汪道涵和李先念副总理的其他随行人员应邀出席了宴会。目前正在柬埔寨访问的越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团委员陈宝剑、越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会副秘书长黎文训、越南民主共和国驻柬埔寨代表团副团长阮水武也应邀出席了宴会。
    中国大使陈叔亮和夫人、中国大使馆参赞郑斯雄和夫人、经济参赞阎培德和夫人也应邀出席了宴会。
    在宴会前，西哈努克亲王和夫人接见了李先念副总理和汪道涵副主任，同他们进行了亲切友好的交谈。宴会后，西哈努克亲王邀请李先念副总理一行观看了文艺演出。
