    Raise Class Consciousness, Identify Fragrant Flowers and Poisonous Weeds
    Five-Good Soldier of a PLA Unit, Yu Zhangsong
    After reading Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," I felt extremely angry. Under the guise of depicting Hai Rui, Comrade Wu Han flagrantly attacked and insulted our beloved Party Central Committee, stood on the position of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism, defended right-leaning opportunism and all the demons and monsters in the country, and portrayed a feudal official Hai Rui as the "savior of the people" and a "hero." If he is the "savior of the people," why is Hai Rui praised by the landlord class? As the saying goes: what kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what class speaks what kind of words. You are reversing the truth of history and attempting to achieve your own political goals through deceptive means!
    Your trickery will be refuted by the broad masses of working people. No matter what tricks you use, you will never succeed, because truth is on the side of the revolutionary people.
    I am a soldier of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and I understand that all poisonous weeds that oppose the Party, oppose the people, and oppose socialism must be completely eradicated. Only in this way can bright red flowers bloom all over the garden.
    The two works written by Comrade Wu Han are two large poisonous weeds that oppose the Party and oppose socialism. They remind every revolutionary youth to continuously strengthen their studies, continuously improve their class consciousness and political sensitivity, in order to increase our ability to identify poisonous weeds and fragrant flowers, and better defend socialism.

    提高阶级觉悟，识别香花毒草
    解放军某部五好战士　余章松
    我看了吴晗同志写的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》以后，感到非常气愤。吴晗同志在描写海瑞的幌子下，大肆攻击和辱骂我们的敬爱的党中央，站在反党、反人民、反社会主义的立场上，给右倾机会主义和国内的一切牛鬼蛇神辩护，把一个封建官吏海瑞说成是“人民的救星”和“英雄”。既然说他是“人民的救星”，为什么海瑞又受到地主阶级的颂扬呢？常言说：什么树开什么花，什么阶级说什么话。你颠倒历史黑白，用骗人的手法妄图达到自己的政治目的！
    你这种鬼把戏是要受到广大劳动人民的驳斥的，不管你用什么样的花招，绝对不会得逞，因为真理是在革命人民这边的。
    我是一个中国人民解放军战士，我懂得：凡是一切反党、反人民、反社会主义的毒草，就要把它彻底铲除掉。只有这样，才能让鲜艳的红花满园盛开。
    吴晗同志写的那两篇作品，是反党反社会主义的两株大毒草。它提醒我们每一个革命青年要不断地加强学习，不断地提高阶级觉悟和政治敏感，以增加我们识别毒草和香花的能力，更好地保卫社会主义。
