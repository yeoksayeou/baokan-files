    Many Rangoon citizens gathered at the airport to welcome the Chinese guests, constantly applauding and shouting slogans such as "Long live the friendship between Burma and China!" and "Wishing Chairman Liu Shaoqi good health!"

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Madame, Vice Premier Chen Yi and Madame, and other Chinese guests walked on the red carpet to the hall of the airport building, where Burmese Foreign Minister U Thi Han introduced them one by one to the diplomatic envoys of various countries stationed here.

    Mingaladon Airport was decorated with the national flags of Burma and China, fluttering in the breeze. At the entrance of the airport building's hall, there was a giant, elaborately crafted golden welcome arch, decorated with small, Burmese-style pagodas. A large banner hung on the arch, with the words "Warmly Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi" written in Burmese and Chinese.

    After the welcoming ceremony, Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Madame, accompanied by Chairman Ne Win and Madame, and Vice Premier Chen Yi and Madame, accompanied by Foreign Minister U Thi Han and Madame, went to the state guesthouse in separate cars, followed by a long motorcade. The capital city of Rangoon, after celebrating the Water Festival, was dressed in festive attire, expressing a warm welcome to the Chinese guests. At every important intersection from Mingaladon Airport to the state guesthouse, national flags of China and Burma were hung. A large billboard was erected on the banks of Inya Lake, with the words "Warmly Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi" written in large Burmese and Chinese characters.

    Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, April 17th -- General Ne Win, Chairman of the Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma, and Madame hosted a grand state banquet here tonight to entertain Chairman Liu Shaoqi of the People’s Republic of China and Madame.

    Chairman Ne Win and Chairman Liu delivered speeches at the state banquet (full text on page 2).

    In his speech, Chairman Ne Win first expressed a very warm and cordial welcome to Chairman Liu Shaoqi and Madame for their visit.

    Chairman Ne Win said: "The fine tradition of friendship and mutual respect has long linked Burma and China together. In the years since our two countries regained full national sovereignty, this tradition has been growing, and today it is specifically reflected in the good-neighborly relations between us. The People's Republic of China respects and supports our long-standing policy of peace, independence, neutrality, and friendship with all countries."

    He said: "Our two countries strictly adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence in our mutual relations. As a good friend, the People's Republic of China sympathetically cares about and concretely helps our efforts to promote social progress and improve the living standards of our people; we are very grateful for this."

    He continued: "I wish to assure Your Excellency that we firmly believe that in an era like today, strengthening and further developing old friendships is as important as seeking new friendships. We are determined to maintain the friendship and good-neighborly relations that already exist between the People's Republic of China and the Union of Burma at all times. We believe that Your Excellency's visit to our country will greatly contribute to further strengthening and developing the relations between our two countries."

    In his speech, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "China and Burma have always been friendly. For more than ten years, no matter what changes have taken place in Asia and the world, Sino-Burmese friendship has continued to develop." He said: "It is by no means accidental that our two countries can live in harmony and cooperate in friendship. The most important reason is that both sides have conscientiously implemented the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the two governments. We have truly respected each other and treated each other as equals. We have always placed the friendship between the two peoples above all else and have solved problems between the two countries in a friendly manner. Our friendly relations are principled and have broad prospects for development."

    Chairman Liu Shaoqi expressed his heartfelt pleasure at the achievements Burma has made in recent years in the struggle against imperialism and in the development of its national economy and culture. He said, "Maintaining national independence and building our own country is the common task of our two countries and the countries of Asia and Africa. Without genuine economic independence, political independence is incomplete and not solid. If the struggle against imperialism is not carried through to the end, the national independence of Asian and African countries will not be guaranteed, and the fruits of economic construction cannot be maintained. The facts of many years, especially the recent subversive and destructive activities of imperialism in the Asian and African region, have made us understand this truth even more deeply. The road to independent development for Asian and African countries is by no means smooth. We Asian and African countries must heighten our vigilance, strengthen our unity, and persist in the struggle. No matter what form they take, it is impossible for colonialists to restore their past colonial rule in the Asian and African region. The final victory of the Asian and African people is beyond doubt."

    Chairman Liu said: "Both of our countries are close neighbors of Vietnam. We naturally care very much about the development of the situation in Vietnam and hope that peace can be restored there as soon as possible." "The Vietnamese people have been fighting for more than twenty years against imperialist aggression, and they certainly hope for peace. However, as President Ho Chi Minh said, 'Genuine peace can never be separated from genuine independence.' The four-point proposition

    刘主席和夫人到达缅甸进行友好访问
    奈温主席和夫人设国宴欢迎中国贵宾
    新华社仰光十七日电　中华人民共和国主席刘少奇和夫人王光美十七日中午十二时三十分（当地时间）乘专机到达缅甸联邦的首都仰光。他们是应缅甸联邦革命委员会主席奈温将军的邀请来缅甸进行友好访问的。
    国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅和夫人张茜、外交部副部长章汉夫和其他随行人员也同机到达。
    在一片节日气氛的明加拉顿机场上，中国贵宾受到了缅甸联邦革命委员会主席奈温将军和夫人以及仰光市民的热烈欢迎。在刘少奇主席和夫人下了飞机踏上铺在机场上的红地毯时，奈温主席和夫人最先迎上去，他们在机旁热烈握手。副总理兼外交部长陈毅和夫人、外交部副部长章汉夫和其他随行人员也受到热烈的欢迎。
    接着，奈温主席把走到机旁来欢迎中国贵宾的革命委员会委员和政府部长们介绍给刘少奇主席、陈毅副总理和其他中国客人。这是老朋友见面，宾主又沉浸在他们的“胞波”亲戚情谊中。
    随后，在机场举行了隆重的欢迎仪式。在鸣放礼炮二十一响，乐队奏起中缅两国的国歌之后，刘少奇主席在奈温主席的陪同下检阅了由缅甸武装部队三军组成的仪仗队。
    聚集在机场欢迎中国客人的许多仰光市民不断鼓掌和高呼“缅中两国友谊万岁！”和“祝刘少奇主席健康！”的口号。所有的欢迎者都穿着节日的盛装，挥动着中缅两国国旗。今天是缅历元旦，机场洋溢着一派节日的欢腾气氛。
    刘少奇主席和夫人、陈毅副总理和夫人以及其他中国客人踏着红地毯走到机场大楼的大厅里，缅甸外交部长吴蒂汉在那里把他们一一介绍给各国驻这里的外交使节。
    明加拉顿机场装饰着的缅中两国国旗，在微风中飘扬。机场大楼的大厅的进口处，有一座精工制作的巨大的金色欢迎牌楼，上面装饰有小型的富有缅甸民族色彩的宝塔。牌楼上挂着一个巨大的横幅，上面用缅文和中文写着：“热烈欢迎刘少奇主席”。
    到机场欢迎刘主席的有：外交和国民计划部长吴蒂汉，革命委员会委员、教育和卫生部长拉汉上校，革命委员会委员、工业和劳工部长貌瑞上校，革命委员会主席办公厅秘书长郭哥上校、军事情报处处长伦上校，外交部常任秘书吴梭丁以及其他高级军政官员。
    到机场欢迎的还有中国驻缅甸大使耿飚和夫人，以及其他许多国家的外交使节。中国大使馆的全体外交官员、旅缅华侨代表、中国专家和留学生也到机场欢迎。
    在欢迎仪式结束后，刘少奇主席和夫人在奈温主席和夫人的陪同下，陈毅副总理和夫人在外交部长吴蒂汉和夫人的陪同下分别乘车前往国宾馆，他们后面是一长列汽车。这个国家的首都仰光，在欢庆了泼水节以后，披着节日的盛装，表示对中国贵宾的热烈欢迎。在明加拉顿机场到国宾馆的每一个重要路口，都挂着中缅两国的国旗。在燕子湖畔竖起了一个大标语牌，上面用很大的缅文和中文写着：“热烈欢迎刘少奇主席”。
    新华社仰光十七日电　缅甸联邦革命委员会主席奈温将军和夫人十七日晚间在这里举行盛大国宴，招待中华人民共和国主席刘少奇和夫人。
    奈温主席和刘主席在国宴上讲了话（全文见第二版）。
    奈温主席在讲话中首先对刘少奇主席和夫人的访问表示十分热烈和亲切的欢迎。
    奈温主席说：“友谊和相互尊重的优良传统长期以来把缅甸和中国连结在一起，在我们两国重新取得完全的国家主权后的年代里，这种传统日益增强，今天具体表现在我们之间的睦邻关系上。中华人民共和国尊重和支持我们的长期不变的和平、独立、中立和同所有国家友好的政策。”
    他说：“我们两国在相互的关系中严格遵循和平共处五项原则，中华人民共和国作为一个好朋友，同情地关心和具体地帮助我们促进社会进步和提高我国人民生活水平的努力；我们对此十分感激。”
    他接着说：“我愿向阁下保证，我们方面坚信，在今天这样一个时代，加强和进一步发展旧的友谊同寻求新的友谊一样重要，我们决心在任何时候维护中华人民共和国和缅甸联邦之间已经存在的友谊和睦邻关系。我们相信，阁下这次访问我国将大大有助于进一步加强和发展我们两国之间的关系。”
    刘少奇主席在讲话中说：“中缅两国历来是友好的。十多年来，不管亚洲和世界上发生什么变化，中缅友谊一直向前发展。”他说：“我们两国能够这样和睦相处，友好合作，这决不是偶然的。最重要的原因是，我们双方认真执行了两国政府共同倡导的和平共处五项原则。我们真正做到了互相尊重，平等相待。我们始终以两国人民的友谊为重，友好地解决两国之间的问题。我们的友好关系是有原则的，是有广阔发展前途的。”
    刘少奇主席对近几年来缅甸在反对帝国主义的斗争中和在发展民族经济和文化方面所取得的成就表示由衷的高兴。他说，“维护民族独立和建设自己的国家，是我们两国和亚非国家的共同任务。没有真正的经济独立，政治上的独立是不完全的，也是不巩固的。不把反帝斗争进行到底，亚非国家的民族独立就没有保障，经济建设的成果也不能保持。多年来的事实，特别是最近帝国主义在亚非地区的颠覆破坏活动，使我们更加懂得这个道理。亚非国家独立发展的道路决不是平坦的。我们亚非国家必须提高警惕，加强团结，坚持斗争。殖民主义者不论它们采取什么形式，要想恢复它们过去在亚非地区的殖民统治，是决不可能的。亚非人民的最后胜利，是毫无疑问的。”
    刘主席说：“我们两国都是越南的近邻。我们自然十分关心越南局势的发展，希望早日恢复那里的和平。”“越南人民为了反对帝国主义的侵略，已经打了二十多年仗，他们当然希望和平。但是，正象胡志明主席所说的，‘真正的和平决不能离开真正的独立。’越南民主共和国政府的四项主张和越南南方民族解放阵线的五点声明，是保证越南独立和实现越南和平和统一的基础。其中最根本的两条就是美国立即撤退在越南的一切军事力量和承认越南南方民族解放阵线是越南南方人民的唯一合法代表。但是美国拒绝接受，还继续扩大侵略越南的战争。在这种情况下，越南人民只有坚决战斗到底。越南人民的斗争是正义的，是一定能取得最后胜利的。中国人民坚决支持英勇的越南人民。”
    出席宴会的还有中国副总理陈毅和夫人，外交部副部长章汉夫和刘主席随行人员中的其他主要官员。出席宴会的还有中国驻缅甸大使耿飚和夫人。
    缅甸方面出席宴会的有革命委员会委员和政府部长。他们包括丁佩准将、山友准将、东丁准将、东丹准将和盛温准将，拉汉上校、貌伦上校、貌瑞上校、东季上校、丹友山上校和丁吴上校以及缅甸外交部长吴蒂汉等。
    宴会上，宾主愉快地进行交谈，并且为两国的“胞波”情谊，为两国领导人祝酒。这表现了两国人民的深厚友谊。
    宴会是在国家宫旁边的草坪上举行的。在这里，树上张挂着无数彩色灯笼，徐徐的晚风十分宜人。缅甸著名的音乐家还在宴会上演奏了动听的缅甸音乐。
    新华社仰光十七日电　缅甸联邦革命委员会主席奈温和夫人十七日晚间在这里举行招待会，欢迎中华人民共和国主席刘少奇和夫人。
    中国副总理兼外交部长陈毅和夫人，外交部副部长章汉夫，以及刘少奇主席的其他随行人员也出席了招待会。
