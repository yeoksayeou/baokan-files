    Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng Delivers a Political Report on the Anti-American National Salvation Cause to the Vietnamese National Assembly
    The Four-Point Stance of the Vietnamese Government is Non-Negotiable
    (Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 27) The Third Session of the Third National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was held in Hanoi from April 16 to 22, 1966.
    President Hồ Chí Minh attended the meeting and delivered a speech.
    The communique issued after the meeting stated that after Trường Chinh, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, delivered the opening speech, Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng delivered a government political report on the nationwide anti-American national salvation cause in Vietnam over the past year or so.
    The meeting also heard reports from Nguyễn Côn, Director of the State Planning Commission, on the direction and tasks of construction and economic development for 1966-1967, as well as the 1966 national plan, a supplementary report on the military situation and tasks from Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Võ Nguyên Giáp, and other reports.
    In his speech, President Hồ Chí Minh warmly praised the great victories achieved by the military and civilians of South and North Vietnam in the anti-American national salvation struggle, and called on them to unite and resolutely complete the arduous and extremely glorious task of defeating the American invading bandits. (His speech will be issued separately)
    Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng's government political report is divided into four parts: The first part reviews the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people over the past year or so; the second part outlines the achievements of the people of North Vietnam in fighting and producing at the same time during the anti-American national salvation struggle and in implementing the first Five-Year Plan; the third part introduces the great victories achieved by the military and civilians of South Vietnam in the struggle against the American invading bandits and their running dogs; the final part of the report points out that the anti-American national salvation struggle of the Vietnamese people has received the support of peace-loving people all over the world, and elaborates on the position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on the settlement of the Vietnam issue.
    He said, "The position of our government and the position of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front are very reasonable and have gained increasing approval and support from people of all countries, including the American people. However, the Johnson administration has turned a blind eye and a deaf ear to this, constantly saying that it 'sees no signs from Hanoi'. At the same time, it is stepping up its criminal war of aggression against Vietnam."
    Speaking about the attitude of the American ruling clique towards the correct position of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, he said: "They have never formally announced that they recognize our position. They oppose the third of our four points because they still pursue a policy of aggression against South Vietnam, attempting to occupy it and turn it into a new type of American colony and military base."
    Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng said, "Opposing the third point is opposing the entire four-point stance." "Our four points have their own content and significance, are closely related and complement each other, thus forming a complete position, of which the third point is a very important link."
    He pointed out, "The South Vietnam National Liberation Front is the only true representative of our South Vietnamese people, and all issues related to South Vietnam must be discussed and resolved with the South Vietnam National Liberation Front."
    He said, "Our four points embody the inalienable rights of the Vietnamese people. This is a principled position and the most reasonable basis for a correct settlement of the Vietnam issue. It is non-negotiable!"
    He said, "As for our entire position, President Hồ Chí Minh's letter has made it clear: 'If the U.S. government is truly willing to settle peacefully, then they must recognize the four points of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and prove it with practical actions by permanently and unconditionally stopping the bombing and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Only then can a political solution to the Vietnam issue be considered.'"
    The meeting discussed Prime Minister Phạm Văn Đồng's report and other reports, and adopted corresponding resolutions and a declaration.
    Tôn Đức Thắng, Lê Duẩn, Trường Chinh, Hoàng Văn Hoan, Võ Nguyên Giáp, Nguyễn Duy Trinh and other Vietnamese state leaders attended the meeting.

    范文同总理在越南国会作关于抗美救国事业的政治报告
    越南政府的四项主张不容讨价还价
    据新华社河内二十七日电　越南民主共和国第三届国会第三次会议于一九六六年四月十六日到二十二日在河内举行。
    胡志明主席出席了会议，并且讲了话。
    会后发表的公报说，国会常务委员会主席长征致开幕词后，范文同总理在会上作了关于一年多来越南全民抗美救国事业的政府政治报告。
    会议还听取了国家计划委员会主任阮昆关于一九六六年到一九六七年建设和发展经济的方向和任务以及一九六六年国家计划的报告、政府副总理兼国防部长武元甲关于军事形势和任务的补充报告和其他的一些报告。
    胡志明主席在讲话中热烈赞扬越南南方和越南北方军民在抗美救国斗争中取得的巨大胜利，号召他们团结一致，坚决完成打败美国侵略强盗的繁重而又无比光荣的任务。（他的讲话另发）
    范文同总理的政府政治报告共分四个部分：第一部分回顾了过去一年多来越南人民的抗美救国斗争；第二部分概述了越南北方人民在抗美救国斗争中边战斗、边生产，在实现第一个五年计划中取得的成就；第三部分介绍了越南南方军民在抗击美国侵略强盗及其走狗的斗争中取得的巨大胜利；报告最后一部分指出了越南人民的抗美救国斗争得到全世界爱好和平人民的支持，并且阐述了越南民主共和国政府关于解决越南问题的立场。
    他说，“我国政府的立场和越南南方民族解放阵线的立场是很合情合理的，已获得包括美国人民在内的世界各国人民越来越大的赞同和支持。然而，约翰逊政府却对此闭目不视和闭耳不听，不断地说它‘没有看到来自河内的迹象’。与此同时，它正在加紧进行侵略越南的罪恶战争。”
    他在谈到美国统治集团对越南民主共和国政府的正确立场采取什么态度时说：“他们从未正式宣布他们承认我们的立场。他们反对我们四项主张中的第三项，因为他们仍然奉行侵略南越的政策，企图占领它并把它变成为美国的新型殖民地和军事基地。”
    范文同总理说，“反对第三项就是反对整个四项主张。”“我们的四项主张具有各自的内容和意义，是密切相关和互为补充的，从而形成一个完整的立场，其中第三项是个很重要的环节。”
    他指出，“南方民族解放阵线是我们的南方人民的唯一真正的代表，一切有关南越的问题必须同南方民族解放阵线会谈和解决。”
    他说，“我们的四项主张体现越南人民的不可剥夺的权利。这是原则性立场，是正确解决越南问题的最合情合理的基础。它是不容讨价还价的！”
    他说，“至于我国的全部立场，胡志明主席的信已经清楚指出：‘如果美国政府真正愿意和平解决，那么他们就必须承认越南民主共和国政府的四项主张，并且以实际行动来证明，必须永远和无条件地停止对越南民主共和国的轰炸和一切其他战争行动。这样才能考虑到越南问题的政治解决办法。’”
    会议讨论了范文同总理的报告和其他的一些报告，并且通过了相应的决议和一项声明。
    孙德胜、黎笋、长征、黄文欢、武元甲、阮维桢等越南国家领导人出席了会议。
