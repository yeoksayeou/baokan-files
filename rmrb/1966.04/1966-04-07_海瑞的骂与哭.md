    Hai Rui's Scolding and Crying
    Zhou Ke
    Abstract: Hai Rui scolded the emperor out of love for the emperor. Comrade Wu Han distorts historical truth, praises Hai Rui's "scolding", and is actually applauding the right-leaning opportunists, beating the drums of bad ideas.
    Comrade Wu Han once wrote an article, "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," in which he said: "In feudal times, the emperor was inviolable. As for scolding the emperor, that was unheard of. The one who truly scolded the emperor, and scolded him very happily, was Hai Rui." Checking the record in "History of the Ming Dynasty: Biography of Hai Rui," it does not say that he scolded the emperor, but that he cried for the emperor, "ceaselessly throughout the night."
    Why did Comrade Wu Han so crudely tamper with history? This contains an extremely malicious political plot. To put it bluntly, it is using the name of Hai Rui "scolding" the emperor to scold the Party and socialism. In order to thoroughly expose this base trick of Comrade Wu Han, let us present the historical facts.
    Comrade Wu Han said that Hai Rui "scolded" the emperor, his basis being Hai Rui's memorial to Jiajing, the "Memorial on Maintaining Order," so we must study the content of the "Memorial on Maintaining Order." From the two characters "zhi an" (maintaining order) we can know the purpose of his memorial. Hai Rui believed that the most important thing at that time was to "correct the way of the ruler, clarify the duties of the ministers, and seek long-term peace and stability." That is, in order to maintain the century-long plan of feudal rule, efforts must be made in two aspects: one is the ruler, the highest ruler, and the other is the ministers who implement policies. The ruler must correct the way of the ruler, and the ministers must fulfill their duties. In the "Memorial on Maintaining Order," when he asked the emperor to correct the way of the ruler, he first flattered Jiajing, saying that Jiajing was "naturally intelligent and decisive, with extraordinary insight," capable of catching up with Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, and Wu above, and surpassing Emperor Guangwu of Han and Emperor Taizong of Tang below. At the same time, he pointed out many shortcomings of Jiajing, saying, "Your Majesty's mistakes are many," such as "increased taxes and levies," "increasingly devoted to Buddhism," "not holding court for more than twenty years, the discipline is lax. Numerous examples of promotion are practiced, titles are abused." He also quoted the words of the common people, saying, "Jiajing means that every family is cleaned out and has no wealth," and so on. Comrade Wu Han believes that these are "the most severe words of Hai Rui scolding the emperor," from which he draws the conclusion that "Hai Rui scolded the emperor."
    Why did Hai Rui submit the "Memorial on Maintaining Order"? According to him, it was because he had "received great favor from the country," so he "revealed his heart and liver to Your Majesty." In order to safeguard the fundamental interests of the Ming dynasty ruling class, he did not hesitate to "risk death" to speak out. Therefore, some people say that Hai Rui's "Memorial on Maintaining Order" was an act of love for the emperor, not scolding the emperor. Of course, to say that Hai Rui did not scold him at all is not entirely true, and some sentences were indeed very severe. But this kind of "corrective scolding" came from love, and was meant to express disappointment that the emperor was not better. Therefore, when Jiajing punished Hai Rui, the order said that Hai Rui "reviled his lord, slandered the ruler, and was disloyal and rebellious" ("Veritable Records of Emperor Shizong of Jiajing," Volume 555), imprisoned him, and intended to sentence him to death. However, behind his back, he praised Hai Rui, comparing him to Bigan, the great loyal minister of the Yin Dynasty.
    Hai Rui's "Memorial on Maintaining Order" was entirely out of "loyalty and patriotism," with the aim of safeguarding the feudal rule of the Zhu Ming Dynasty and the long-term interests of the landlord class. The Ming emperors deeply understood Hai Rui's feelings, believing that his motives were good and his subjectivity was sincere. Therefore, the Ming emperors did not fail Hai Rui's "loyalty" and "sincerity," and reused him as the inspector of Ying Tian. At that time, the landlord-class literati unanimously praised Hai Rui's loyalty.
    In feudal times, every dynasty had ministers who dared to speak out and offer advice to the emperor to consolidate their class interests. Submitting memorials to the emperor and discussing the major affairs of the world was a common occurrence in feudal society, and Hai Rui was merely one of them. Yet Comrade Wu Han actually reversed Hai Rui's expression of loyalty to his master, saying that he "scolded" the emperor. How absurd!
    As for how Hai Rui cried for the emperor, Hai Rui, in order to consolidate the rule of the Ming Dynasty, submitted a memorial to Jiajing with utmost sincerity, but Jiajing imprisoned him. According to reason, Hai Rui should not have had any good feelings for Jiajing, at least he had been wronged. When the prison officer told him that Jiajing had died, that he would soon be released and had hope of being reused, he should have been happy, according to ordinary feudal officials. However, Hai Rui was not happy or joyful, but rather sad and wept bitterly. How should this be explained? According to Hai Rui's lifelong words and deeds, Hai Rui held infinite loyalty to the Ming Dynasty ruling class and placed great hope in Jiajing. His belief was to be loyal to his feudal dynasty and emperor, even to death without regret. He resolutely defended the interests of the feudal class, so he was not happy because of his release. Although Jiajing had punished him, he believed that Jiajing's death might affect the rulers' power, might make the stable political situation turbulent, and if another fatuous emperor like Emperor Wuzong Zhengde of Ming Dynasty (Jiajing's older brother, who died without children, and Jiajing entered Beijing as a prince to succeed him) appeared, it would further shake the foundation of the Zhu Ming Dynasty. Therefore, Hai Rui's crying was for the class interests of his class and for the rise and fall of the feudal dynasty. This further proves that Hai Rui was the most loyal slave of the feudal dynasty. When we comment on Hai Rui, we should pay special attention to his crying for the emperor and carefully analyze it. Hai Rui's special appearance is indeed the tenacious spirit of the so-called "loyal ministers and filial sons" praised in ancient feudal society, which can fully explain what kind of person Hai Rui was.
    Hai Rui's face and essence are so clearly expressed. Hai Rui, starting from his class emotions and his feudal morality, his loyalty and love for Jiajing, and his firm maintenance of the feudal system, were consistent from beginning to end. Therefore, his "scolding" and love are consistent, and his "scolding" and crying are also consistent.
    Comrade Wu Han looks at it from another angle, not paying attention to whether Hai Rui scolded him or not, but only taking whether he dared to scold him or not. He said that only Hai Rui scolded the emperor, and scolded him very happily. The implication is that no one dared to scold the emperor, but Hai Rui dared to, therefore praising Hai Rui as "truly a man of integrity." What does Comrade Wu Han mean by raising this point and applauding it so happily?
    These historical facts are very clear, and Comrade Wu Han, who is known as a "Ming History expert," also understands them. So, why did Comrade Wu Han want to wantonly tamper with history like this? Is this an accidental mistake? No! As long as we mention the class struggle situation when Comrade Wu Han wrote and published "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," his intention is exposed. When Comrade Wu Han was vigorously praising Hai Rui for scolding the emperor, it was the time when a small handful of right-leaning opportunists were taking advantage of the temporary difficulties facing our country to cooperate with the anti-China chorus of imperialism and revisionism and launch a frenzied attack on the Party and the people. The right-leaning opportunists scolded the Party, scolded socialism, and scolded the three red banners. Comrade Wu Han also wrote articles, advocating "scolding," and promoting Hai Rui's "very happy" scolding of the emperor. Comrade Wu Han's article is actually applauding these right-leaning opportunists and beating the drums of bad ideas.

    海瑞的骂与哭
    周克
    提要　海瑞骂皇帝实是爱皇帝。吴晗同志歪曲历史真实，吹捧海瑞的“骂”，实际上是为右倾机会主义分子拍手叫好，大鼓坏劲。
    吴晗同志曾写过一篇《海瑞骂皇帝》，他说：“在封建时代，皇帝是不可侵犯的，至于骂皇帝，那是没有听说过的。真正骂过皇帝，而又骂得非常之痛快的是海瑞。”查《明史·海瑞传》的记载，其中并没有说他骂过皇帝，却说他哭皇帝，“终夜不绝声”。
    吴晗同志为什么要这样粗暴地篡改历史呢？这里包藏着极其恶毒的政治阴谋。说穿了，就是借海瑞“骂”皇帝之名，来骂党、骂社会主义。为了彻底揭穿吴晗同志这一卑劣伎俩，让我们把历史事实摆一摆。
    吴晗同志说海瑞“骂”过皇帝，其根据是海瑞上嘉靖的《治安疏》，因此我们不能不研究一下《治安疏》的内容。从“治安”二字便可以知道他上疏的目的。海瑞认为，当时最重要的事情，是“正君道，明臣职，求万世治安”。就是认为要维持封建统治的百年大计，必须从两方面努力，一是最高统治者的君，一是执行政策的臣，君要正君道，臣要尽臣职。在《治安疏》里，他要求皇帝正君道时，先对嘉靖吹捧一番，说嘉靖“天质英断，睿识绝人”，上之可以赶上尧、舜、禹、汤、文、武，下之亦可以超越汉光武、唐太宗等。同时又指出嘉靖的许多缺点，说“陛下之误多矣”，如“赋役增常”，“礼佛日甚”，“二十余年不视朝，纲纪弛矣。数行推广事例，名爵滥矣”。又引老百姓的话，说“嘉靖者，言家家皆净而无财用也”，云云。吴晗同志认为这是“海瑞骂皇帝最厉害的几句话”，从中得出了“海瑞骂皇帝”的结论。
    海瑞为什么要上《治安疏》？据他说，是“受国恩厚矣”，所以才“披肝胆为陛下言之”。他为了维护明朝统治阶级的根本利益，不惜“冒死”进言。因此，有人说海瑞的《治安疏》是爱皇帝，并没有骂皇帝。当然，要说海瑞没有骂过几句，也不尽然，甚至有几句却乎骂得很厉害。但这种“骂正”是出于爱，是恨铁不成钢的意思。所以嘉靖处罚海瑞时，下的命令说海瑞“詈主毁君，不臣悖道”（《世宗嘉靖实录》卷五五五），把他关进监狱，拟处以死刑。然而，他背地里却夸奖海瑞，把他比作殷朝的大忠臣比干。
    海瑞上《治安疏》完全出于“忠君报国之心”，目的是维护朱明王朝的封建统治和地主阶级的长远利益。明朝皇帝深切了解海瑞的心情，认为他的动机是好的，主观是真诚的。所以明朝皇帝并没有辜负海瑞的“忠心”、“赤忱”，重用他为应天巡抚。当时地主阶级文人，对于海瑞的忠诚也是一致地赞扬不已。
    在封建时代，每个朝代都有极言敢谏之臣，为皇帝出谋献策以巩固他们的阶级利益。对皇帝上《治安疏》，痛论当时天下大事，在封建社会是屡见不鲜的，海瑞不过是其中之一而已。而吴晗同志竟把海瑞对其主子的效忠表现，颠倒过来说成是“骂”皇帝，岂不荒谬。
    至于海瑞是怎样哭皇帝的呢？海瑞为了巩固明朝的统治，忠心耿耿向嘉靖上疏，嘉靖反而把他关进监狱。按常理说，海瑞对于嘉靖是没有什么好感的，至少是受了委屈的。当狱吏告诉他，嘉靖已死，他即将被释放并有希望被重用时，按一般封建官吏来说，他是应该感到高兴的。然而，海瑞却并没有高兴喜悦，反而伤心痛哭。这该如何解释呢？根据海瑞生平的言论和行动，海瑞对明朝统治阶级抱着无限忠诚，对嘉靖寄予极大希望。他的信念是对他的封建皇朝及皇帝尽忠，虽死而无怨。他坚决维护封建阶级利益，所以他并没有因为出狱而高兴。嘉靖虽然处罚过他，但他认为嘉靖一死，可能影响统治者的政权，可能使稳定的政局动荡不安，如再出一个象明武宗正德（嘉靖的哥哥，死后无子，嘉靖以藩王入京继位）那样昏乱的皇帝，则更将动摇朱明王朝的国本。所以海瑞之哭，是为他本阶级的阶级利益及封建王朝的兴衰而哭。这就更证明了海瑞是封建王朝中最忠实的奴才。我们评论海瑞，对他哭皇帝这一幕应该特别重视，仔细分析。海瑞所表现的特殊面貌，确是古代封建社会中所称道的所谓“忠臣孝子”的坚韧精神，这完全可以说明海瑞是个什么人。
    海瑞的面貌和本质表现得如此清楚。海瑞从他的阶级情感出发，从他的封建道德出发，他对嘉靖的忠诚爱戴，对封建制度的坚决维持，是始终如一的。所以他的“骂”与爱是一致的，“骂”与哭也是一致的。
    吴晗同志是从另一个角度看，并不注意海瑞是不是骂，而只取敢骂不敢骂。他说只有海瑞骂过皇帝，并且骂得很痛快。意思说谁也不敢骂皇帝，而海瑞敢了，因此赞扬海瑞“真是铮铮一汉子”。吴晗同志这样提法，这样拍手称快，是什么意思呢？
    这些历史事实是十分清楚的，以明史“专家”著称的吴晗同志心里也是明白的。那末，吴晗同志为什么要这样肆意篡改历史呢？这是偶然的错误吗？不！只要提一提吴晗同志写作、发表《海瑞骂皇帝》时的阶级斗争形势，其用意就暴露了。在吴晗同志大肆歌颂海瑞骂皇帝的时候，正是一小撮右倾机会主义分子利用我国面临暂时困难的时机，配合帝国主义和修正主义的反华大合唱，向党向人民发动猖狂进攻的时候。右倾机会主义者骂党、骂社会主义、骂三面红旗。吴晗同志也大写文章，鼓吹“骂”，宣扬海瑞对皇帝“骂得非常之痛快”。吴晗同志的文章，实际上是为这些右倾机会主义分子拍手叫好，大鼓坏劲。
