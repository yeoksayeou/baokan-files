    Launch Youth to Take the Lead in Studying
    Yin Xinglu, Party Branch Secretary of Lijiazhuang, Linqu, Shandong

    Our brigade has five production teams, 181 households, and 886 people. There are currently 16 Party members; 153 young people, including 53 Youth League members.

    Before liberation, the good land in our village was concentrated in the hands of a few landlords and rich peasants. Poor and lower-middle peasants had very little bad land, and life was difficult to sustain. Before liberation, 39 households in the entire brigade fled famine, and 80 households borrowed grain to survive. In the years before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries burned, killed, and looted in our village, causing the population to scatter and the land to be deserted, almost turning it into an uninhabited village.

    In 1945, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, our hometown was liberated. Through land reform, mutual aid and cooperation, and up to today's people's commune system, the poor people have turned themselves over. However, there were 300 mu of waterlogged land in the village that had been passed down from the older generation and had never been properly transformed. Although a large canal was built under the leadership and support of the higher-level Party committee, because there were no supporting water conservancy facilities, it still suffered from floods whenever there was heavy rain, and the yield remained stagnant at more than 300 jin for a long time.

    In recent years, under the leadership of the higher-level Party committee, we have read Chairman Mao's books and listened to Chairman Mao's words. The revolutionary enthusiasm of the commune members has increased, and production has increased year after year. Although the drought was relatively severe last year, we still achieved a yield of 920 jin per mu.

    The activities of studying Chairman Mao's works in our brigade are carried out step by step by grasping the youth, leading all commune members, and promoting each other. Our Party branch believes that young people grow up in the new society, have simple ideas, are educated, and demand to study and make progress. However, adults and the elderly have low levels of education, and it is somewhat difficult to learn all at once. First grasping the youth's study can not only better improve their political consciousness and give play to their active role, but also guide adults and the elderly and help the masses of commune members to study. Therefore, the Party branch put forward specific requirements to the Youth League branch, requiring it to focus on grasping the youth's study, letting the youth learn first, learn more, learn wider, learn more flexibly, and learn, use, and act at the same time. The Party branch assigned Party branch member Yin Xingfang to specifically grasp the youth's activities of studying Chairman Mao's works. As soon as the young people read Chairman Mao's books, everyone became more motivated, good deeds and good people increased day by day, and their ideological outlook underwent great changes.

    On the basis of the development of the youth's study of Chairman Mao's works, the Party branch further organized the study of the masses of commune members by using the youth as the backbone. First, through studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," the 300 mu of waterlogged land left by the predecessors was initially transformed. When adults and elderly commune members started to learn, they in turn promoted the study of the young people. In the study, adults and the elderly educated the young people with their rich experience in class struggle and production struggle, helping the young people to learn more solidly. The Party branch repeatedly emphasized: it is not good to memorize well, it is good to use it well, and we must learn and use at the same time, and implement the study in production actions to achieve a double harvest of ideology and production.

    Now, not only Party members, Youth League members, and young people are studying in our village, but also the elderly are studying, and a mass learning movement with the Party branch as the core has been formed.

    Our activities of studying Chairman Mao's works have only just begun, and there is still a big gap compared with advanced units such as Daqing and Dazhai. We are determined to lead all commune members and young people to learn from advanced units and better carry out the activities of studying Chairman Mao's works. (Attached picture)

    The Lijiazhuang Party branch pointed out in response to the problems in the youth's study: It is not good to memorize well, it is good to use it well.

    发动青年带头学	山东临朐李家庄党支部书记　尹兴禄
    俺大队有五个生产队，一百八十一户，八百八十六人。现有党员十六名；青年一百五十三名，其中团员五十三名。
    解放前，俺庄的好地都集中在几户地主、富农手里，贫下中农只有很少的坏地，生活难以维持。全大队解放前逃荒要饭的有三十九户，借粮度日的有八十户。解放前几年，国民党反动派在俺庄烧杀抢掠，弄得人丁四散，土地荒芜，几乎成了无人庄。
    一九四五年，在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，解放了我们的家乡。经过土地改革，互助合作，一直到今天的人民公社化，穷苦人民来了个大翻身。但是，村里从老辈手里就有三百亩涝洼地，一直没有改造好。虽然在上级党委的领导和支援下，修了一道大干渠，但因为没有水利配套，所以一遇到下大雨，仍然遭受水灾，产量长期停留在三百多斤，一直上不去。
    近几年来，我们在上级党委的领导下，读了毛主席的书，听了毛主席的话，社员革命干劲大了，生产连年增产。去年虽然旱情比较严重，但也取得了亩产九百二十斤的收成。
    俺大队学习毛主席著作的活动，是采取抓青年、带全体社员、互相促进的办法逐步开展起来的。我们党支部认为，青年长在新社会，思想单纯，有文化，要求学习，要求进步。而成年老年文化低，一下子学起来，就有些困难。先抓青年学习，既可以更好地提高他们的政治觉悟，发挥他们的积极作用；又可以对成年老年进行辅导，帮助社员群众进行学习。所以党支部就向团支部提出了具体要求，要突出抓好青年的学习，让青年先学点，多学点，学宽点，学活点，边学边用边行动。党支部分工让党支部委员尹兴方具体抓青年学习毛主席著作的活动。青年们一读毛主席的书，个个添了干劲，好人好事一天天多起来了，思想面貌大变样。
    党支部在青年学习毛主席著作活动开展起来的基础上，运用青年作骨干，进一步组织了社员群众的学习。首先通过学习《愚公移山》，初步改造了前辈留下来的三百亩涝洼地。成年老年社员学起来了，反过来又推动了青年人的学习。在学习中，成年老年以他们丰富的阶级斗争和生产斗争的经验，教育了青年们，帮助青年们学得更扎实。党支部反复强调：背得好不算好，用得好才算好，要边学边用，把学习落实到生产行动上，取得思想、生产双丰收。
    现在，俺庄不仅党员学，团员学，青年学，而且老年也学，已经形成了一个以党支部为核心的群众性的学习运动。
    我们学习毛主席著作的活动还刚刚入门，同大庆、大寨等先进单位比，还有很大差距。我们决心带领全体社员和青年向先进单位学习，把学习毛主席著作的活动更好地开展起来。（附图片）
    李家庄党支部针对青年学习中的问题，指出：光背得好不算好，用得好才算好。
