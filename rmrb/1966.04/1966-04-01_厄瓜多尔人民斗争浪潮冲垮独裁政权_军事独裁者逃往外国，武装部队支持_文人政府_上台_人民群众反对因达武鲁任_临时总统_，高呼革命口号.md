    This newspaper reports comprehensively, according to Xinhua News Agency, Quito news: Under the impact of the people's strong anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle, the Ecuadorian military dictatorial regime, fostered single-handedly by the United States, collapsed on the 29th. The three heads of the Military Committee "resigned" and immediately fled abroad.
    Since the pro-American military dictatorial regime came to power in July 1963, the Ecuadorian people have been engaged in a heroic and unyielding anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle. Since late January of this year, the storm of struggle has developed to a new climax. The voices of "Down with American imperialism" and "Down with the dictatorial government" resounded throughout the country.
    This new storm of anti-dictatorship began on the 18th in the capital, Quito (Ecuador's second largest city, located in Pichincha Province). With the pro-American reactionary regime's brutal suppression, especially the authorities' massacre of students in Quito on the 25th, the scale of the struggle continued to expand. Since the 22nd, business and industrial circles in Quito, Guayaquil (capital of Guayas Province), the largest city, and other cities have successively launched strikes to protest the government's economic policies of selling out national interests.
    According to reports, in Guayaquil, thousands of citizens once again took to the streets on the 28th to hold fierce anti-dictatorship demonstrations. Military police fired a large number of tear gas canisters and even opened fire to suppress the masses. However, the morale of the masses was extremely high. They built barricades in the streets and used stones to fight back against the military police like artillery fire, and the battle lasted for several hours. Angry masses also burned three official vehicles and smashed the dictatorial regime's National Bank and National Development Bank with stones.
    In Cuenca (capital of Azuay Province), the third largest city, and Loja (capital of Loja Province), the fourth largest city, citizens also held anti-government demonstrations on the 28th. The American "Abraham Lincoln" Cultural Center in Cuenca was attacked by patriotic masses. Demonstrators in both places engaged in heroic battles with the military police in the streets, and at least five people were shot dead by the reactionary military police. According to reports, an anti-government demonstration also broke out in Portoviejo, the capital of Manabí Province, on the 28th.
    In this explosive situation, the pro-American reactionary authorities – the Military Committee – held another emergency meeting on the 28th, and after the meeting issued a communiqué, once again hypocritically promising to submit to the heads of various political parties "basic reforms aimed at restoring constitutional government", repeating the bankrupt tricks. Prior to the publication of this communiqué, the four ministers of finance, agriculture, industry and commerce, and public works of the dictatorial government were forced to resign.
    However, the anger of the masses has still not subsided. The three heads of the Military Committee had to "resign" on the 29th and flee abroad.
    According to reports, when students in the capital, Quito, and the largest city, Guayaquil, heard the news of the collapse of the military dictatorial regime, they immediately took to the streets, shouting "Death to the dictators!" Some students in Quito rushed to the Military Committee's "Presidential Palace," but were suppressed by the guarding troops with tear gas. Other students occupied the official radio station. A large number of students also attacked the prison in Quito, rescuing many political prisoners held there, including some patriots accused of engaging in guerrilla activities. Under pressure from the masses, the military authorities announced the release of a group of arrested student leaders and the restoration of six closed radio stations.
    The students called on the people to carry out a "protracted anti-oligarchic struggle."
    However, the heads of the three armed forces of Ecuador, while announcing the resignation of the heads of the Military Committee, held a meeting that day. This meeting, chaired by Telmo Vargas, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, and attended by armed forces and some political party personnel, decided that Clemente Yerovi Indaburu, former chairman of the National Economic Planning Commission, would serve as "interim president." The meeting was held at the Ministry of Defense.
    According to United Press International, the U.S. government is "sympathetic" to Ecuador's so-called new "civilian government." The news said: "There are indications that the United States welcomes Ecuador's return to civilian rule." U.S. State Department officials consider Yerovi to be a "progressive moderate," "he seems to have the support of the Ecuadorian military and non-military personnel."
    Yerovi Indaburu was sworn in as "interim president" on the 30th amidst popular opposition. Indaburu is a landowner and shipowner. He once served as the manager of the Guayas Province Bank, and served as Ecuador's ambassador to the United Nations General Assembly, cabinet minister of finance, and other positions.
    At the inauguration ceremony of Yerovi Indaburu, Telmo Vargas, Chief of General Staff of the Armed Forces, formally stated that the armed forces supported the "interim government" headed by him.
    However, students in Cuenca, Ecuador's third largest city, announced that they refused to recognize Yerovi Indaburu as "interim president." At the same time that Indaburu was sworn in, students in the capital held demonstrations outside the Presidential Palace, chanting slogans such as "Revolution!" and "Down with the oligarchy!"
    Indaburu asked the people through the radio to "calm down and go back to work," but tens of thousands of Ecuadorians took to the streets to celebrate the collapse of the reactionary Gijón regime. (Image attached)

    厄瓜多尔人民斗争浪潮冲垮独裁政权
    军事独裁者逃往外国，武装部队支持“文人政府”上台
    人民群众反对因达武鲁任“临时总统”，高呼革命口号
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯，基多消息：在人民群众强烈的反美反独裁斗争的冲击下，由美国一手扶植的厄瓜多尔军事独裁政权二十九日宣告垮台。军事委员会的三个头目“辞职”，随即逃往国外。
    自从一九六三年七月亲美军事独裁政权上台以来，厄瓜多尔人民就一直进行着英勇的、不屈不挠的反美反独裁斗争。今年一月下旬起，斗争的风暴发展到了新的高潮。“打倒美帝国主义”、“打倒独裁政府”的声音响彻全国。
    这次反独裁的新风暴是十八日从首都基多（厄瓜多尔第二大城市，位于皮钦查省）开始的。随着亲美反动政权的残暴镇压，特别是当局二十五日对基多学生实行屠杀，斗争的规模不断地扩大着。从二十二日起，基多和第一大城市瓜亚基尔（瓜亚斯省首府）以及其它一些城市的工商界已先后发动了罢市，抗议政府出卖民族利益的经济政策。
    据报道，在瓜亚基尔，几千市民二十八日再次涌上街头，举行激烈的反独裁示威。军警发射大量催泪弹甚至开枪镇压群众。但是群众的斗志极为高昂。他们在街上筑起路障，用石块象排炮似的还击军警，搏斗持续达几个小时。愤怒的群众还烧毁了官方的三辆汽车，用石头猛击独裁政权的国家银行和国家发展银行。
    在第三大城市昆卡（阿苏艾省首府）和第四大城市乐哈（乐哈省首府）市民们二十八日也举行反政府示威。昆卡的美国“阿伯拉翰姆·林肯”文化中心遭到了爱国群众的袭击。两地的示威群众在街上同军警展开英勇的搏斗，至少有五个人遭反动军警枪杀。据报道，在马纳比省首府波尔托维霍，二十八日也爆发了反政府的示威。
    在这种爆炸性的形势下，亲美反动当局——军事委员会二十八日再次举行紧急会议，并在会后发表公报，再次假惺惺地许诺将向各政党首脑提出“旨在恢复宪政的基本改革”，重施已经破产的骗人故技。在发表这项公报之前，独裁政府的财政、农业、工商和公共工程部的四个部长被迫辞去了职务。
    但是，人民群众的怒火仍然未能平息。军事委员会的三个头目不得不于二十九日“辞职”，逃往外国。
    据报道，首都基多和第一大城市瓜亚基尔的学生们听到军事独裁政权垮台的消息时，立即涌上街头，高呼“处死独裁者”。基多的一些学生冲向军事委员会的“总统府”，但是遭到守卫部队用催泪瓦斯镇压。另一些学生占领了官方广播电台。还有大批学生袭击了基多的监狱，抢救出被关在那里的许多政治犯，其中包括一部分被指控为从事游击活动的爱国者。在群众的压力下，军事当局宣布释放一批被捕的学生领导人，恢复六家被封闭的电台。
    学生们号召人民进行一场“持久的反寡头斗争”。
    但是，厄瓜多尔的三军首脑在宣布军事委员会头目辞职的同时，在当天举行了一个会议。这个由武装部队参谋长特尔莫·巴尔加斯主持的一次有武装部队和一些政党人员参加的会议确定由前全国经济计划委员会主席克莱门特·耶罗维·因达武鲁来担任“临时总统”。这次会议是在国防部举行的。
    据合众国际社透露，美国政府对所谓厄瓜多尔的新的“文人政府”是“同情的”。这条消息说：“有迹象表明，美国欢迎厄瓜多尔恢复文人执政”。美国国务院官员认为耶罗维是一个“进步的温和派”，“他看来得到厄瓜多尔的军方和非军方人士的支持。”
    耶罗维·因达武鲁三十日在群众反对他的呼声中宣誓就任“临时总统”。因达武鲁是地主和船主。一度当过瓜亚斯省银行的经理，担任过厄瓜多尔出席联合国大会的大使、内阁财政部长等职务。
    在耶罗维·因达武鲁就职的仪式上，武装部队总参谋长特尔莫·巴尔加斯正式表示武装部队支持以他为首的“临时政府”。
    但是，厄瓜多尔第三大城市昆卡的学生宣布拒绝承认耶罗维·因达武鲁为“临时总统”。在因达武鲁宣誓就职的同时，首都的学生在总统府外面举行示威游行，并高呼“革命！”和“打倒寡头！”等口号。
    因达武鲁通过电台要求人民“平静下来，回去工作”，但是成千上万的厄瓜多尔人却拥上街头，庆祝希洪反动政权垮台。（附图片）
