    Run People's Stores, Serve as Revolutionary Furnaces
    ——An Interview with the Youth Grain Store in Anyang City, Henan Province
    Editor's Note: Socialist stores, by their nature, are people's stores. How did the Youth Grain Store in Anyang City become a people's store in the true sense of the word? The most fundamental thing is that they have cultivated a workforce of employees who are both red and expert, armed with Mao Zedong Thought.
    Stores are run by people. Without revolutionary people, how can there be revolutionary stores? Without people who wholeheartedly serve the people, how can there be stores that wholeheartedly serve the people? The reason why the Youth Grain Store has become a truly people's store is that it is good at educating people, good at transforming people, educating and transforming young people with various non-proletarian ideologies into red shop assistants who enthusiastically serve the masses.
    Socialist commercial enterprises should not only do business but also cultivate people. They are not only an economic front for serving the people but also a revolutionary furnace for forging talents to serve the people. The facts of the Youth Grain Store fully prove that to run a store as a people's store, the store must play the role of a revolutionary furnace.
    In the ancient city of Anyang, there is a Youth Grain Store. The average age of the twenty-five employees who have worked here is only twenty-something, and the youngest is only sixteen this year.
    It is these young people who have established close and inseparable ties with the masses with a red heart for the revolution and for the people. They have been repeatedly selected as advanced units in the national grain system and have attended the National "Heroes' Conference." For ten years, they have always maintained the honor of an advanced collective.
    The Youth Grain Store's good shop style of wholeheartedly serving the people has been unanimously praised by the residents of more than a dozen surrounding streets and 2,400 households. Batch after batch of young people are transferred from schools or other positions, plunged into this revolutionary furnace, refine their hearts to serve the people, and cultivate their skills to serve the people. Then, batches of them are sent out, like red seeds, spreading and turning more grain stores red.
                  Refining Thought
    Whenever a new employee steps through the door, the first lesson is to receive education in serving the people. This is a good tradition formed by this grain store over many years.
    When the grain store was first built, Qin Zhiguo, a member of the Communist Youth League, and his two partners came here. On the first day, the person in charge of the superior party organization said to them: The grain store is an important position that embodies the Party's concern for the lives of the masses. Revolutionary predecessors shed blood and sacrificed themselves to eliminate exploitation and let the working people live a good life. In our work, we must always be considerate of the difficulties of the masses and wholeheartedly run the people's grain store. Qin Zhiguo, who grew up begging for food, and his two companions, under such education, broke with conventions, rotated rest, took turns eating, and ensured early opening, no breaks at noon, and late closing at night, so that the masses could buy grain in time; seeing that it was inconvenient for elderly people living alone to buy grain, they came up with the idea of delivering grain to their doorsteps and have persisted in doing so. ...
    These young people's spirit of caring for the lives of the masses with great enthusiasm has been commended by their superiors. In 1956, at the National Conference of Activists in the Grain System, the Ministry of Grain awarded them a deluxe edition of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong." The employees realized: This is the Party's encouragement. We must follow Chairman Mao's instructions and run the grain store even better. Since 1963, they have learned from Lei Feng, the People's Liberation Army, and Daqing, further enhancing their consciousness of studying Chairman Mao's works, and closely integrating the study of Chairman Mao's works with the realization of ideological revolutionization and enterprise revolutionization.
    Wang Yide, who is just twenty years old, used to be a correspondent in another unit. When he came to the Youth Grain Store in 1963, he always felt that holding the weighing pole was not promising. Zheng Donglin, the director of the grain store, studied "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses and Attention to Methods of Work" with him. Little Wang understood that if commercial personnel actively help the masses solve practical problems, the masses will love the Communist Party, love Chairman Mao, and love socialism even more. When he was visiting households in the streets, he came to the home of old Mrs. Wang Qiaoyun at No. 10 Xinying Street. This old lady was in her eighties. She told Wang Yide that she had not been to the grain store to buy grain for ten years. In the past ten years, she has only seen the employees who came to deliver grain changed five or six times, but each one treated her like a relative.
    Chairman Mao's teachings and the deeds of the old employees in caring for the lives of the masses made Wang Yide feel enlightened. He was determined to inherit this spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people.
    One day, Wang Yide went to deliver grain to old Mrs. Wu, who lived alone on Sandao Street. He carried the grain into the door and saw that the old lady was lying on the bed and feeling uncomfortable. Wang Yide put down the grain, and also helped Grandma Wu light the stove and cook, and invited a doctor to see her. Later, when old Mrs. Wu's illness got better, Wang Yide went to visit her again. The old lady was so moved that she said repeatedly: "You are really good cadres taught by Chairman Mao. Only in the new society can you care for me, an old woman living alone!" Over the past few years, Wang Yide has done many such good things for the masses.
    Like Wang Yide, once the young employees who come to this grain store understand the principle that holding the weighing pole and selling grain is also for the revolution, they constantly improve their work, making the store's tradition of enthusiastically serving the masses increasingly flourish.
    Ma Xianyang, a young accountant, saw that a customer bought more than 100 jin of grain and carried it back and forth several times. He thought, there are many residents who buy one or two hundred jin of grain every month. It's tiring to carry grain like that! He discussed it with his companions and made a simple grain truck out of two old wooden boxes, making it easier for people who buy a lot of grain to push the grain home.
    Women who bring their children to buy things cannot take care of the children while taking care of pouring oil and buying grain. They used collective bonuses to buy a crib with railings. Mothers can put their children in the crib and buy things with peace of mind.
    There are many institutions, factories, and stores near the Youth Grain Store. The grain store also tries its best to provide convenience and support their work and production. Dual-income families in these units can leave their grain bags in the grain store and conveniently pick up the pre-filled grain after get off work.
    People who go to the Youth Grain Store feel like they are at home. If the oil bottles they bring are not enough, there are empty bottles collected by employees that can be borrowed; if they forget to bring the rope to tie the flour bags, there are spare hemp ropes available here; if they buy a variety of grains and don't have anywhere to put them, the grain store prepares paper bags for customers; if the oil bottle does not have a lid, there are wooden plugs made by the employees themselves.... A hemp rope, an oil bottle, a paper bag, a bottle stopper, these all seem like insignificant things, but they are all permeated with the deep affection of the employees for serving the people.
                Cultivate Skills
    After the young employees of this grain store studied Chairman Mao's works and established the idea of wholeheartedly serving the people, working hard to practice excellent skills became their conscious activity. In the process of practicing skills, they constantly draw strength from Chairman Mao's works to encourage themselves to overcome difficulties.
    The story of female accountant Fan Yunxiu practicing basic skills is the most moving. In order to shorten the grain purchase time for the masses, she was determined to improve her business skills. However, two clingy children and tedious housework made her determination to practice hard waver a little. She studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man advocated by Chairman Mao inspired her. She made several copies of the accumulated prices of various grains and oils, put one on her desk, put one in her clothes pocket, and posted one on the head of her bed at home. She took it out and read it while holding the child to breastfeed, recited it at the head of the bed before going to bed, recited it while washing clothes, and recited it while walking on the road. Her spirit of working hard to practice basic skills for the revolution and for the people moved her lover. Every day after get off work, he took the initiative to undertake housework such as cooking and carrying water, so that Fan Yunxiu could free up more time to practice. When the housework was finished in the evening and the children were settled down to sleep, Fan Yunxiu's lover would pretend to be a customer and ask her to buy different quantities of various grains and oils, testing her again and again to see if she could accurately state the price.
    Fan Yunxiu persisted in practicing like this every day with amazing perseverance and tenacity. In more than a year, she developed the most outstanding "one-mouth clear" skill in the grain system of Anyang Prefecture, Henan Province. Customers buy five or six varieties of oil grains, within fifty jin, and she can generally say the price quickly without using an abacus. Compared with the past, efficiency has increased by two times, saving the masses time to buy grain. She sold 3.36 million jin of grain using this method, received more than 138,000 payments, totaling more than 400,000 yuan, without a single mistake.
    Now, the accountants and salespeople of the Youth Grain Store have basically mastered skills such as "one-mouth clear" for accounting and "one-scale accurate" for weighing grain.
                Cultivate New People
    The Youth Grain Store, like a revolutionary furnace, absorbs batches of young students and many young employees who are considered naughty by other units, and educates them into red shop assistants who enthusiastically serve the masses.
    In March last year, the Municipal Personnel Bureau introduced a young man named Liu Yukun to work at the Youth Grain Store. Liu Yukun was a well-known "disobedient" employee in the Anyang City Grain System. Many people discussed: Can an advanced unit like the Youth Grain Store accept a backward employee who has changed five or six jobs? Liu Yukun was also worried that he would not be welcome. At this time, the director of the grain store personally pulled a cart to help him move his luggage, and kindly told him that everyone was waiting for him to come to the store. At the gate of the grain store, Liu Yukun was warmly welcomed by all the employees. The comrades enthusiastically gave him books such as "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Youth Self-Cultivation" as gifts. As soon as Liu Yukun stepped into the gate of the Youth Grain Store, he felt warm in his heart.
    The Party and Youth League organizations and all the employees cared for him and helped him with great enthusiasm. Once, Liu Yukun miscalculated one jin of grain, and could not figure it out for a while, and argued with the customer. Fan Yunxiu, who was next to him, persuaded the customer to go home first, and then helped Liu Yukun calculate the accounts and check, and found that one jin of grain was indeed given less to the customer. She mobilized him to send the grain to the customer and apologize. However, Liu Yukun's thinking was not clear. The Party branch secretary kindly said to him with Chairman Mao's words: We serve the people, and we are not afraid of others criticizing our shortcomings. The branch secretary personally accompanied him to send the grain. The customer was deeply moved to see them come to deliver the grain. Before they apologized, they took the initiative to check that their attitude was not good, which caused trouble to the grain store. This gave Liu Yukun a profound education. Since then, his service attitude has changed significantly.
    Soon, the Youth Grain Store was rated as an advanced collective in Anyang City in studying Chairman Mao's works. The superior awarded a "Selected Works of Mao Zedong". The Party organization and employees of the grain store discussed and decided to hand over this "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" to Liu Yukun for safekeeping and study. At the general meeting of all the employees of the grain store, in the enthusiastic applause of the comrades, Liu Yukun took over the "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" with both hands and excitedly expressed: He will definitely read Chairman Mao's books seriously, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and work with the comrades to wholeheartedly serve the people.
    Many young employees have been tempered in this revolutionary furnace and sent out to support fraternal units. Of the fifteen employees sent out by the Youth Grain Store, most of them have become leaders and backbones of other grain stores. They brought the Youth Grain Store's style of thinking about customers everywhere and serving the masses enthusiastically to new units, where they took root, sprouted, blossomed, and bore fruit.
    The Toudao Street Grain Store used to be a backward grain store with relatively poor service quality. After Yang Xingui and other four employees were transferred here from the Youth Grain Store, they immediately went to the streets to visit households, solicit opinions from the masses, and help customers solve difficulties. They led other employees to improve counter service work, deliver grain to elderly people living alone, and made "convenient vehicles" and cribs themselves. This grain store originally only operated grain. They heard that residents nearby had to run a mile to buy edible oil, so they took the initiative to request from the leadership to add the business of selling edible oil. Their spirit of enthusiastically serving the masses has been unanimously praised by residents nearby.
    Duan Bingsen, the salesperson with the highest business skills in the Youth Grain Store, was transferred to the Cangxiang Street Grain Store, which originally had poor business operations, to serve as the director. He brought the spirit of practicing basic skills for the revolution to the new unit, and led all the salespeople to actively practice the skills of "one-scale accurate" and "one-mouth clear".

    办人民商店　作革命熔炉
    ——河南安阳市青年粮店访问记
    编者按　社会主义的商店，就其性质来说，是人民的商店。安阳市青年粮店是怎样成为一个名副其实的人民商店的？最根本的一条，就是培养了一支用毛泽东思想武装起来的又红又专的职工队伍。
    商店是靠人办的，没有革命化的人，哪有革命化的商店？没有全心全意为人民服务的人，哪会有全心全意为人民服务的商店？青年粮店所以办成了真正的人民商店，就因为它善于教育人，善于改造人，把各种带有非无产阶级思想意识的青年人，教育和改造成热心为群众服务的红色营业员。
    社会主义商业企业，不仅要做买卖，而且要培养人。不仅是为人民服务的经济阵地，而且是锤炼为人民服务的人材的革命熔炉。青年粮店的事实充分证明，要把商店办成人民商店，就要使商店发挥革命熔炉的作用。
    在古城安阳，有一家青年粮店。前后在这里工作过的二十五名职工，平均年龄不过二十几岁，最小的今年才十六岁。
    就是这些年青人，以一颗为革命、为人民的红心，同群众建立了息息相关、亲密无间的联系。他们多次被评选为全国粮食系统的先进单位，并出席过全国“群英会”。十年来，始终保持了先进集体的荣誉。
    青年粮店全心全意为人民服务的好店风，受到周围十几条街道、两千四百户居民的一致赞扬。一茬接一茬的小青年，从学校或其他岗位上调来，投入到这座革命的熔炉里，炼红了为人民服务的心，练就了为人民服务的本领。然后，又一批批输送出去，象一粒粒红色的种子，传播开来，红遍更多的粮店。
                  炼　思　想
    每逢新职工踏进门槛，第一课就是接受为人民服务的教育。这是这个粮店多年形成的一条好传统。
    当粮店初建，共青团员秦治国和他的两个伙伴来到这里的第一天，上级党组织的负责同志就对他们说：粮店是体现党对群众生活关怀的重要岗位。革命先辈流血牺牲，为的是消灭剥削，让劳动人民过好生活。咱们在工作中可要处处体贴群众疾苦，全心全意办好人民的粮店。从小要饭长大的秦治国和他的两个同伴，就是在这样的教育下，打破常规，串换休息，轮流吃饭，做到提早开门，中午不间歇，晚间迟关门，使群众及时可以买到粮食；看到孤寡老人买粮不方便，他们想出了登门送粮的办法，并且一直坚持下去。……
    这些年青人满怀热情关怀群众生活的精神，受到了上级的嘉奖。一九五六年，在全国粮食系统积极分子会议上，粮食部奖给他们一部精装的《毛泽东选集》。职工们领悟到：这是党的勉励，咱们一定要按照毛主席的指示，把粮店办得更好。一九六三年以来，他们学习雷锋、学习人民解放军、学习大庆，进一步提高了学习毛主席著作的自觉性，并且把学习毛主席著作同实现思想革命化和企业革命化紧密结合起来了。
    年刚二十岁的王义德，原来在别的单位当通讯员，一九六三年来到青年粮店，总觉得扶秤杆子没有出息。粮店主任郑东林和他一起学习《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》。小王懂得了商业人员积极帮助群众解决实际问题，群众就会更加热爱共产党、热爱毛主席、热爱社会主义。他在下街访户的时候，来到新营街十号王巧云老大娘家。这位老大娘八十来岁了。她告诉王义德，她有十年没去粮店买粮了。十年当中，她只见来送粮的职工先后换了五六个人，可是一个个都待她象亲人一样。
    毛主席的教导，老职工关心群众生活的事迹，使王义德心里亮堂了。他决心继承这种全心全意为人民服务的精神。
    有一天，王义德去给三道街一个孤身过活的吴老大娘送粮。他背着粮食进门，见老人家躺在床上，正不舒服。王义德放好粮食，还顺便帮吴大娘点起炉子，做上饭，并且请医生来给她看病。后来，吴老大娘病好一些，王义德又去看望她。老大娘感动得连声说：“你们真是毛主席教导出来的好干部，只有新社会才这样关怀我这孤老婆子！”几年来，王义德为群众办了不少这样的好事情。
    象王义德一样，来到这个粮店的青年职工，一经懂得扶秤杆卖粮也是为了革命的道理，他们就不断地改进工作，使店里热心为群众服务的传统日益发扬光大。
    青年会计马显扬看到一位顾客买了一百多斤粮食，来回背了几趟。他想，每月买一二百斤粮食的居民不少，都这样背粮够多累呀！他便和同伴商量，用两个旧木箱钉了一辆简易运粮车，方便买粮多的人把粮食推回家去。
    妇女带着小孩来买东西，顾了灌油买粮，顾不了照管孩子。他们便用集体奖金买了一张带栏杆的小孩床。妈妈们把小孩放在床上，就可以安心地买东西了。
    青年粮店附近，有不少机关、工厂、商店。粮店里也多方设法送方便，支持他们的工作和生产。这些单位夫妇都工作的双职工，可以把粮袋留在粮店里，下班以后再把装好的粮食顺便取走。
    人们到青年粮店，就象到了自己家里一样。带的油瓶不够，有职工收集的空瓶可以借用；忘记带捆面袋的绳头，这里有备用的麻绳；买的粮食品种多，没处盛，粮店里为顾客准备了纸袋；油瓶没有盖，这里有职工自制的木塞……。一根麻绳，一只油瓶，一个纸袋，一个瓶塞，看起来都是一些微不足道的小东西，但是，里面都渗透着职工们为人民服务的深情。
                练　本　领
    这个粮店的青年职工，学习毛主席著作，树立起全心全意为人民服务的思想以后，下苦功练过硬本领，就成了他们自觉的活动。在练本领的过程中，他们又不断地从毛主席著作中汲取鼓舞自己克服困难的力量。
    女会计范云秀练基本功的故事，最为动人。她为了缩短群众的购粮时间，下决心要提高业务技术。可是，两个缠手的孩子和繁琐的家务劳动，使她练硬功夫的决心有些动摇。她学习了《愚公移山》，毛主席提倡的愚公精神鼓舞了她。她把各种粮油的累计价格复写了几份，在办公桌上放一份，衣服口袋里装一份，家里床头上贴一份。抱着孩子喂奶的时候掏出来念，临睡以前在床头念，洗衣服的时候背诵，走在路上也背诵。她这种为革命、为人民苦练基本功的精神，感动了她的爱人。他每天下班以后，主动承担做饭、担水等家务劳动，使范云秀腾出更多的时间来练功。当晚上整理完家务，把孩子们安顿睡下以后，范云秀的爱人就扮作顾客，向她提出要买各个品种不同数量的粮油，一次又一次地测验她能否准确地说出价钱。
    范云秀以惊人的毅力和韧性，天天这样坚持练习。一年多的时间，就练成了河南省安阳专区粮食系统中最出色的“一口清”本领。顾客买五六个品种的油粮，在五十斤以内，她一般都能不用算盘，很快说出价钱。同过去比较，效率提高两倍，节省了群众购粮的时间。她用这种办法销售了三百三十六万斤粮食，收款十三万八千多人次，共计四十多万元，没有发生过一次差错。
    现在，青年粮店的会计和营业员，基本上都掌握了算账“一口清”、秤粮“一秤准”等技能。
                育　新　人
    青年粮店，它象一座革命熔炉，把一批又一批的青年学生和不少其他单位认为是调皮的青年职工吸收进来，教育成了热心为群众服务的红色营业员。
    去年三月间，市人事局介绍一个名叫刘玉坤的青年人，到青年粮店工作。刘玉坤，在安阳市粮食系统是有名的“不听话”的职工。许多人议论：青年粮店这样一个先进单位，能要一个调换了五六个工作岗位的后进职工吗？刘玉坤也担心自己不受欢迎。就在这时候，粮店主任亲自拉着架子车来帮助他搬运行李，并且亲切地告诉他，大家都在等待他到店里来。在粮店门口，刘玉坤受到了全店职工的热情欢迎。同志们热情地把毛主席著作单行本、青年修养等方面的书籍送给他作为礼物。刘玉坤一跨进青年粮店大门，心里就感到暖烘烘的。
    党团组织和全体职工，大家都满怀热情地关怀他，帮助他。有一次，刘玉坤算错了一斤粮食，一时弄不清楚，和顾客争吵起来。旁边的范云秀劝说顾客先回家去，接着就帮助刘玉坤算账查对，查明确实少给了顾客一斤粮食。她便动员他把粮食送去，向顾客道歉。可是，刘玉坤思想不通。党支部书记便用毛主席的话亲切地对他说：我们是为人民服务的，有缺点就不怕别人批评指出。支部书记亲自陪着他把粮食送去。顾客看到他们来送粮，深受感动。不等他们道歉，就主动检查自己态度不好，给粮店增加了麻烦。这使刘玉坤受了一次深刻的教育。以后，他的服务态度有了显著改变。
    不久，青年粮店被评为安阳市学习毛主席著作的先进集体。上级奖给了一部《毛泽东选集》。粮店党组织和职工们讨论决定，把这部《毛泽东选集》交给刘玉坤保管和学习。在粮店全体职工会上，在同志们热情的掌声中，刘玉坤双手接过《毛泽东选集》，激动地表示：一定认真地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，和同志们一起，全心全意地为人民服务。
    许多青年职工在这个革命熔炉中接受了又红又专的锤炼，又被输送出去支援兄弟单位。青年粮店先后输送出去的十五名职工，大部分都成了其他粮店的领导人员和骨干。他们把青年粮店处处为顾客着想、热诚为群众服务的作风带到新的单位，在那里生根发芽，开花结果。
    头道街粮店原来是一个服务质量比较差的后进粮店。杨新贵等四名职工由青年粮店调到这里以后，马上就串街访户，征求群众意见，帮助顾客解决困难。他们带动其他职工改进了柜台服务工作，为孤寡老人送粮，并且自己动手制造了“便民车”和小孩床。这个粮店原来只经营粮食，他们听说附近居民要跑一里路去买食油，就主动向领导要求增加了出售食油的业务。他们这种热心为群众服务的精神，受到附近居民一致称赞。
    青年粮店业务技术最高的营业员段炳森，调到原来业务经营较差的仓巷街粮店去当主任。他把为革命练基本功的精神带到新的单位，带动全体营业员都积极练习“一秤准”和“一口清”的本领。
