    Not Afraid of "Old" Factories, Only Afraid of "Old" Thinking
    Worker of Wei Hai Iron Factory Zhang Quangen
    Our factory's buildings and equipment are very poor, but the quality of our factory's product, automobile steel plate springs, has caught up with Changchun First Automobile Factory, and is now catching up with the world's most advanced levels.
    I remember when it was proposed to catch up with Changchun at the beginning of 1964, using the "three olds" to catch up with the "three news," some comrades said: "How can a reed shed compete with steel and concrete?" Now, the facts have answered: "Reed sheds" are not lower than steel and concrete, and it is even possible that they are higher than steel and concrete.
    What's the reason? The reason is that although our factory buildings are "old masters" and our equipment is also "old masters," our workers are not "old masters" (Shanghai dialect, meaning not dilapidated). Catching up with advanced levels does require certain conditions, such as equipment, technology, factory buildings, and so on. But among all these conditions, the decisive factor is the human factor.
    The same person is very different before and after liberation. Before liberation, our blacksmiths were slaves to the bourgeoisie, seeing the bosses getting richer and richer, and the workers getting poorer and poorer, how could they have the mind to engage in production? After liberation, we became masters of our own house and controlled our own destiny. We produce for the revolution, the more we do, the more energetic we are, what difficulties cannot be overcome?
    The proletariat's revolution is to rely on our own hands to create various conditions to transform the objective world.
    As long as the mind is not "old," old factory buildings and old equipment can be changed. Now, our factory's conditions are very different from the past. But to catch up with the world's most advanced level, we must further create conditions and further change the appearance of factory buildings and equipment.

### 不怕厂房“老”  只怕思想“老”

    不怕厂房“老”  只怕思想“老”
    卫海铁工厂工人　张泉根
    我们厂的厂房和设备都很差，但是，我们厂的产品汽车钢板弹簧的质量，赶上了长春第一汽车厂，现在还在赶超世界最先进水平哩。
    记得一九六四年初提出赶长春，以“三老”赶“三新”的时候，有同志说：“芦席棚怎么能和钢骨水泥比高低？”现在，事实作了回答：“芦席棚”不比钢骨水泥低，还有可能比钢骨水泥高。
    什么道理呢？道理就在于，我们的厂房虽然“老爷”，设备也“老爷”，但是我们工人不“老爷”（上海话，即不破旧的意思）。赶超先进水平确实需要一定的条件，比如设备、技术、厂房等等都是。但是这一切条件中，起决定作用的是人这个条件。
    同样是人，解放前后大不相同。解放前，我们铁匠为资产阶级做牛马，看到的是老板越来越富，工人越来越穷，哪有心思搞生产呢。解放后，我们当家作了主人，自己掌握了命运。我们生产为革命，越干越有劲，有什么困难不能克服呢？
    无产阶级闹革命，就是要靠自己动手，来创造各种条件，来改造客观世界。
    只要思想不“老”，老的厂房老的设备，都是可以改变的。现在，我们厂的条件和过去就已经大不相同了。但要赶超世界最先进的水平，还要进一步创造条件，进一步改变厂房和设备的面貌。
