    Leading agricultural production: is it primarily dealing with the heavens, or primarily dealing with people? Today's *People's Daily* publication of the spring plowing preparations in Fangshan, Hukou, and Zhaodong counties vividly illustrates that we should deal with people first. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, do a good job in people's political and ideological work, revolutionize people's thinking, raise consciousness, and actively deal with the heavens, so that "man can conquer nature" and improve production.
    In this year's spring plowing production, the leadership ideology and working methods of many county party committees have undergone great changes. They are no longer busy asking for numbers and urging progress; instead, they are going deep into the front line of production, participating in labor, grasping living thoughts, and promoting the ideological revolutionization of people, launching a spring plowing production upsurge on the basis of raising the ideological consciousness of the peasant masses. They are dealing with people first, mobilizing people to deal with the heavens and the land.
    The fundamental task of the Party in the countryside is to educate and transform peasants with Mao Zedong Thought, and gradually cultivate peasants into laborers with a high degree of socialist consciousness. Agricultural production is a matter for the broad masses of peasants. Whether we lead spring plowing, summer hoeing, water control, or soil improvement, we must put political work first, so that peasants understand why these things are being done, what is the relationship between these things and our country's socialist revolution and the revolutionary cause of the people of the world, and understand what things should be done and what things should not be done. When everyone has a firm direction and a clear goal, they will work together wholeheartedly. Doing this political and ideological work well can broaden the peasants' narrow horizons and liberate their thinking from "small families" and "small collectives," farming for the revolution and producing for the revolution. In this way, the enthusiasm and creativity of the peasants will be fully mobilized; they will not be daunted by difficulties, nor elated by achievements; they will continuously revolutionize and continuously advance.
    Is it grasping production for production's sake? Or is it emphasizing politics to promote production? This is a fundamental question of which direction the collective economy is moving. If the leaders' minds are only thinking about various numbers and their eyes are only watching the progress of production, trapping themselves in the circle of production business, production will certainly not be done well, and may even lose its direction and go astray. Only by emphasizing politics and continuously improving the revolutionary consciousness of the peasant masses can we correctly handle various problems in production and promote the continuous development of the collective economy. The process by which comrades in Fangshan, Hukou, and Zhaodong counties led the masses to carry out the spring plowing production campaign once again illustrates this truth.
    Of course, consciously emphasizing politics in leading agricultural production is only a beginning for many county and commune party committees. Consciously emphasizing politics is a process of repeated practice and gradual improvement. From simply grasping numbers and urging progress to first grasping people and ideological work is a great progress; from grasping general ideological work to complete the task at hand, to grasping directional issues and ideological work, and fundamentally improving the ideological consciousness of peasants, is an even greater progress. On the basis of repeated practice and continuous summing up of experience, the leadership of the county party committee will be raised to a new level, and will better lead the continuous and healthy development of the agricultural production upsurge.
    Now, spring plowing production has become busy from south to north. The responsibility of leaders at all levels in counties and communes is to carry out collectivism, patriotism, internationalism, and communism education for cadres and the masses of the county and commune, based on their living thoughts and combined with the current spring plowing work. When cadres and the masses have a high degree of political and ideological consciousness, spiritual power will become a huge material force, and they will not be afraid of difficulties, troubles, hardship, or fatigue; they will dare to fight, dare to win, and strive to improve agricultural production. Increased agricultural production will further encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people, and strive to create greater achievements in production with more full-bodied revolutionary energy.

### 突出政治  领导春耕

    突出政治  领导春耕
    领导农业生产，是首先同天打交道呢？还是首先同人打交道呢？今天本报发表的房山、湖口、肇东三县准备春耕的消息，生动地说明了首先应该同人打交道。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，做好人的政治思想工作，人的思想革命化了，觉悟提高了，主动地、积极地同天打交道，就能“人定胜天”，把生产搞好。
    在今年的春耕生产中，很多县委的领导思想和工作方法，有了很大的变化。他们不再忙于要数字、催进度了；而是深入生产第一线，参加劳动，抓活思想，促进人的思想革命化，在提高农民群众思想觉悟的基础上，掀起春耕生产高潮。他们是首先同人打交道，发动人去同天、同地打交道。
    党在农村的根本任务，就是用毛泽东思想教育和改造农民，逐步把农民培养成为具有高度社会主义觉悟的劳动者。农业生产是广大农民的事情，我们不论是领导春耕、夏锄，不论是领导治水、改土，都必须把政治工作放在第一位，使农民懂得为什么要作这些事情，这些事情同我国的社会主义革命事业和全世界人民的革命事业有什么关系，懂得什么事情该作、什么事情不该作。大家有了坚定的方向，明确的目标，就会齐心来作。把这样的政治思想工作做好了，就可以打开农民的狭小眼界，把他们的思想从“小家庭”、“小集体”解放出来，为革命种田，为革命生产。这样，就会把农民的积极性、创造性充分调动起来，有了困难吓不倒，有了成绩喜不倒；不断革命，不断前进。
    是就生产抓生产？还是突出政治促进生产？这是使集体经济朝着什么方向前进的一个根本问题。如果领导者的头脑里只是想着各种数字，眼睛只是望着生产进度，把自己陷在生产业务的圈子里，生产就一定搞不好，甚至迷失方向，走到邪路上去。只有突出政治，不断提高农民群众的革命自觉性，才能正确地处理生产中的各种问题，促进集体经济不断发展。房山、湖口、肇东三县同志领导群众开展春耕生产运动的过程，再一次说明了这个真理。
    当然，自觉地在领导农业生产中突出政治，对于许多县、社党委来说，还只是开始。自觉地突出政治，是一个反复实践、逐步提高的过程。由单纯抓数字、催进度到首先抓人、抓思想工作，这是一个很大的进步；由抓一般的思想工作，完成当时的任务，到抓方向性的问题和思想工作，从根本上提高农民的思想觉悟，这是一个更大的进步。在反复实践、不断总结经验的基础上，县委的领导就会提到一个新的水平，更好地领导农业生产高潮持续地健康地发展。
    现在，春耕生产已经由南而北地忙起来。县、社各级领导干部的责任，就是针对本县本社干部和群众的活思想，结合当前春耕工作，对他们进行集体主义、爱国主义、国际主义和共产主义教育。干部、群众有了高度的政治思想觉悟，精神力量就会变成巨大的物质力量，就会不怕困难、不怕麻烦，不怕苦，不怕累，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，努力提高农业生产。农业生产提高了，又将进一步鼓舞广大干部、群众的积极性，以更加饱满的革命干劲，争取在生产上创造更大的成绩。
