     Mao Zedong's Works are "Political Grain"
    —How We Organize Workers to Study and Apply Mao Zedong's Works in a Living Way

    Without a high tide of studying Mao Zedong's works, there will be no new high tide of production
    "Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist of our time. Every sentence of Chairman Mao's words is truth. Persistently studying Chairman Mao's works can not only revolutionize our thinking and carry the socialist revolution and socialist construction through to the end, but also ensure that our descendants remain red for generations and that our Party and country never change their nature."
    "Reading Chairman Mao's books has not only great practical significance but also far-reaching historical significance; it can not only solve personal ideological problems but also solve work problems; it can not only solve the problems of the Chinese revolution but also solve major world revolution affairs."
    "Chairman Mao's books are political grain," "Chairman Mao's books are the guiding light of revolution, the key to solving problems. Reading Chairman Mao's books makes people clear-headed, bright-eyed, and steady on their feet," "One day without reading Chairman Mao's books, the brain becomes sluggish."
    The above paragraphs reflect the views of the vast number of workers in our factory on Mao Zedong's works, and reflect the urgent demands and mood of the vast number of workers for studying Mao Zedong's works.
    Since 1965, in accordance with the wishes of the vast number of workers, we have organized cadres and workers throughout the factory to extensively study Mao Zedong's works, pushing the movement of studying Mao Zedong's works to a new high tide. On the basis of this new upsurge in study, a new upsurge in production has been launched in our factory. Over the past year, we have deeply realized that Mao Zedong Thought is the most correct and has the greatest power. Without Mao Zedong Thought, this revolutionary theory, there would be no revolutionary actions of the vast number of workers in our factory; without a high tide of studying Mao Zedong's works, there would be no new high tide of production.
    Over the past year, how have we organized the vast number of cadres and workers to study Mao Zedong's works? In terms of organizing the study, we have adopted different methods for different objects, treating them differently. That is: different departments have different learning requirements; different people study different content; different people adopt different forms and methods of study. In addition to organizing all cadres and workers to adhere to regular study, in 1965, we also held rotating training courses for studying Mao Zedong's works. In the past year, we have run five types of full-time rotational training courses: mid-level cadre training courses, each lasting 40 days, three sessions; Party member training courses, each lasting 10 days, a total of twenty sessions; worker training courses, each lasting 12 days, twenty-seven sessions; engineering and technical personnel training courses, each lasting 18 days, four sessions; militia training courses, each lasting 21 days, fifteen sessions. Many workers said: "After entering the rotating training course, my thinking took a turn." Everyone called the rotating training course a "political workshop" and a "hospital for curing ideological illnesses."
    The effect of studying Mao Zedong's works is very significant. In the past year, 70% of the cadres and workers in our factory have entered full-time rotating training courses to study. Not only has this not affected production, but it has greatly mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of workers. We completed the annual locomotive overhaul task 40 days ahead of schedule, and the annual freight car overhaul task 8 days ahead of schedule.
    Improve the Consciousness of Studying Mao Zedong's Works
    To study Mao Zedong's works, we must study consciously and apply consciously, so that we can learn deeper and better. Therefore, to organize the vast number of workers and masses to study Mao Zedong's works, we must first mobilize everyone's learning consciousness. It can be said that grasping the work of learning consciousness is to grasp people's learning "automation." When everyone has a high degree of consciousness in studying Mao Zedong's works, they will consciously learn and apply at any time and any place.
    We have adopted four different methods, aimed at different situations of different people, to enlighten everyone's learning consciousness.
    Use reminiscence of bitterness to enlighten. Comparing the past and present, thinking of the source when drinking water, recalling the bitterness of the past, and recalling the bitterness of the class is an effective method to enhance class feelings and improve learning consciousness. We often adopt this method, especially around the "February 7th" incident, we concentrate on class education and revolutionary tradition education for about a month. In the activities commemorating "February 7th," we enlightened everyone to recall how our workers were emancipated? Everyone said: "Chairman Mao led us to make revolution and become emancipated," "Chairman Mao is our guide," "Chairman Mao's thought is the guiding light of revolution. Without the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought, we cannot be emancipated, China cannot be liberated, the reactionaries cannot be overthrown, and imperialism cannot be ultimately eliminated," "Chairman Mao's books are the truth. If we don't read Chairman Mao's books, how can we listen to Chairman Mao's words? If we don't listen to Chairman Mao's words, how can we follow Chairman Mao?" With class feelings, and understanding that Chairman Mao's books are books for making revolution, a strong desire to study will be generated, and the more one learns, the more one will love to learn.
    Use sweetness to attract. Showing sweetness, talking about gains, and talking about progress is another good way to attract everyone to study Mao Zedong's works. After showing sweetness, everyone can more deeply appreciate the power of studying Mao Zedong's works. There was an old worker who used to always make trouble about personal interests, and he always had opinions every time he was assessed for awards. After studying Mao Zedong's works, his ideological awareness improved, and he tasted the sweetness, becoming a "study fanatic." He studied Mao Zedong's works at home at night, and had a conflict with his wife. His wife said: "I can't sleep with the light on." He would go to bed first, and after his wife fell asleep, he would get up and turn on the light to study again. This spirit of hard study moved his wife. His wife said: "Does Chairman Mao's works have such great power? Can it really fascinate and stick to people?" He said: "If you don't believe it, try it." His wife tried it, and she also became fascinated, and the family relationship underwent new changes. We asked this old worker to show sweetness, and the more he showed, the sweeter it became, which enlightened everyone's learning consciousness. In 1965, we conducted two factory-wide mass activities of showing the sweetness of studying.
    Use backbones to help. When we train study backbones, we require the backbones to not only take the lead in studying well, but also to carry out ideological mutual assistance in many ways, and to enlighten everyone's learning consciousness with flexible and diverse forms and methods. One night, the study backbone of the fitter group of the locomotive workshop guided everyone to discuss the "class nature of people" in the single dormitory. A worker who had not been speaking felt interested and asked everyone, "What is class?" The study backbones said: "Tell us what you think." He said with confidence: "Class is just different people, some exploiting people and some being exploited." The study backbones asked again: "What is exploitation?" He said: "Landlords use big dippers to collect and small dippers to give out, that is exploitation." Someone said: "What if you use the same dipper? Is it still exploitation?" He said: "No." This sentence made everyone in the room laugh. After the meeting, the study backbone talked with him and helped him explain clearly what is class and what is exploitation, improving his understanding. Later, this worker also joined the study group.
    Use typical examples to promote. We often invite study activists from inside and outside the factory and from inside and outside the railway system to give reports to enlighten everyone's learning consciousness. After the All-Railway Mao Zedong's Works Activists Congress, we invited Sun Guilan, who was blind in both eyes, to talk about his moving deeds of studying Mao Zedong's works, which caused a great shock. The old workers said: "In the past, we said our eyes were blurred and we couldn't study. Compared with those who have no eyes, we have nothing to say." Comrades who had no culture said: "In the past, we always said that we had no culture and it was difficult to study Mao Zedong's works. It seems that the difficulty is not great, but our perseverance is small. If someone with no eyes can study, why can't we with eyes study?" This powerfully promoted everyone's study.
    Work Hard on the Word "Use"
    On the basis of grasping the consciousness of learning, we also grasped the question of how to learn. How to learn? We must work hard on the word "use."
    Learn with problems in mind, starting with transforming thinking. To study Mao Zedong's works, we must learn with problems in mind and work hard on the word "use." To learn with problems in mind, we must first learn with ideological problems; to work hard on the word "use," we must first work hard on transforming thinking. To study Mao Zedong's works, if we want to link it to our own thinking, we must put down our ideological baggage. In the study, some cadres believe that: "They are cadres, have a long history of struggle, and have made great contributions to the Party. Transforming thinking is someone else's business. They are helping others to transform their thinking." Some comrades said: "We can't speak, we can only do. We don't manage money, and we don't manage accounts. We are neither greedy nor sticky. The word 'transform' is not pointing at our heads." These ideological baggage are "roadblocks" on the road to studying Mao Zedong's works and transforming thinking. Only by putting down the baggage, daring to expose one's own thinking, and carrying out criticism and self-criticism can we make progress. Some workers said well: "Study for the sake of use, study for revolution, when thought is revolutionized, work is active"; "If thought is good, work can be good, if thought is revolutionized, work can be revolutionized."
    Use in learning, learn in using. Some comrades said: "Living study and application cannot be forgotten, if you forget this, you will turn direction." The vast number of cadres and workers regard Mao Zedong's works as the "guide to action" and the "golden key" to solving problems. Everyone's specific experience in learning is: "Study diligently and compare frequently, ask for advice more often when encountering problems, summarize while learning, and often find gaps."
    Sun Lizhen, deputy director of the Power Workshop, studied Mao Zedong's works and persisted in "skillfully using three surpluses" (get up early, go to bed late, play less on Sundays) for a long time, and consulted Mao Zedong's works whenever he encountered problems. In 1963, the factory bought a set of oxygen production equipment. After dismantling it, it turned out to be a broken machine. In order to revive the dead machine, Comrade Sun Lizhen went deep into the worker masses for a long time, working and conducting investigations and research at the same time. At the same time, he encouraged the worker comrades to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and the spirit of the Foolish Old Man who removed the mountains to overcome difficulties. After working for more than a year, this machine was finally put into production in November 1964. However, in mid-November, the problem of oil entering the separation tower was suddenly discovered. This problem was no small matter. If it was discovered late and the oil spread, the machine would be in danger of exploding. In order to solve this problem, the workers went to Beijing, Hangzhou and other places to invite "famous teachers" and learn "high skills," but they did not find a reliable solution. Comrade Sun Lizhen organized everyone to study Mao Zedong's "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which made the workers realize that "we must ride on difficulties, not go around difficulties." With the confidence to overcome difficulties, they held five "Zhuge Liang meetings" in a row and conducted repeated experiments. Finally, they figured out the cause of the oil entry and solved this problem.
    Repeatedly learn, repeatedly use. To study Mao Zedong's works, we must adhere to it for a long time, repeatedly learn, repeatedly use, continuously summarize, and improve step by step. Wang Yu'an, a Communist Party member of the Transportation Workshop, studied "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" five times in order to solve the old key problem of the small crane, so that the machine was restored to youth.
    "Four combinations," one comparison. When organizing workers to study Mao Zedong's works, we have always advocated combining it with the situation, combining it with tasks, combining it with thinking, and combining it with business. In the study, see how Chairman Mao said it, and how did you think about it? Comparing like this has great gains and good results.
    Our study of Mao Zedong's works is only the beginning. Although there have been considerable gains, there are still many problems. In 1966, we will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, highlight politics, put the study of Mao Zedong's works in the first place of all work, further strengthen leadership, work hard on the word "use," and fundamentally promote the ideological revolutionization of the vast number of workers.

     毛主席著作是“政治粮食”
    ——我们是怎样组织职工活学活用毛主席著作的
    中共长辛店机车车辆工厂政治部
    没有学习毛主席著作的高潮，便没有新的生产高潮
    “毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思主义者，毛主席的话句句是真理。坚持学习毛主席著作，不仅能使我们的思想革命化，把社会主义革命和社会主义建设进行到底，而且能使我们的子孙万代代代红，永保我们党和国家不变质。”
    “读毛主席的书，不仅有巨大的现实意义，而且有深远的历史意义；不仅能解决个人思想问题，而且能解决工作问题；不仅能解决中国革命问题，而且能解决世界革命的大事”。
    “毛主席的书是政治粮食”，“毛主席的书是革命的指路明灯，是解决问题的钥匙。读毛主席的书，使人心明、眼亮、脚跟稳”，“一天不读毛主席的书，脑袋瓜子就迟钝”。
    上面几段话，反映了我们厂的广大职工对于毛主席著作的看法，反映了广大职工对于学习毛主席著作的迫切要求和心情。
    一九六五年以来，我们按照广大职工的愿望，组织全厂干部和工人大学毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作运动推向了一个新的高潮。在这个新的学习高潮的基础上，掀起了我厂新的生产高潮。一年来，我们深深体会到，毛泽东思想最正确，威力最大，没有毛泽东思想这个革命的理论，便没有我厂广大职工的革命行动；没有一个学习毛主席著作的高潮，便没有一个新的生产高潮。
    一年来，我们是怎样组织广大干部和职工学习毛主席著作的呢？在组织学习方面，我们采取了不同对象，区别对待的办法。这就是：不同的部门，提出不同的学习要求；不同的人，学习不同的内容；不同的人，采取不同的学习形式和学习办法。除了组织全体干部和工人群众坚持经常学习外，在一九六五年，我们还举办了学习毛主席著作的轮训班。去年一年间，我们办了五种脱产轮训班：中层干部轮训班，每期四十天，办了三期；党员轮训班，每期十天，共办了二十期；工人轮训班，每期十二天，办了二十七期；工程技术人员轮训班，每期十八天，办了四期；民兵训练班，每期二十一天，办了十五期。许多工人说：“进了轮训班，思想转了个弯。”大家称轮训班是“政治车间”、“治思想病的医院”。
    学习毛主席著作的效果是十分显著的。去年一年间，我们厂百分之七十的干部和工人进了脱产轮训班学习，不但没有影响生产，反而大大地调动了广大职工的积极性和创造性。我们提前四十天完成了全年机车检修任务，提前八天完成了全年货车检修任务。
    提高学习毛主席著作的自觉性
    学习毛主席著作，要自觉地学，自觉地用，才能越学越深，越学越好。因此，组织广大职工群众学习毛主席著作，首先要把大家的学习自觉性调动起来，可以这样说，狠抓学习自觉性的工作，就是狠抓人们的学习“自动化”的工作。大家都有了学习毛主席著作的高度自觉性，就会随时随地自觉地学，自觉地用。
    我们针对不同人的不同情况，采取了四种不同的方法，启发大家的学习自觉性。
    用忆苦启发。今昔对比，饮水思源，忆过去苦，忆阶级苦，是增强阶级感情，提高学习自觉性的一个有效方法。我们经常采取这种方法，特别在“二七”前后，我们集中用一个月左右的时间，进行阶级教育和革命传统教育。在纪念“二七”的活动中，我们启发大家回忆了我们工人是怎样翻身解放的？大家说：“是毛主席领导我们闹革命翻了身”、“毛主席是我们的带路人”、“毛主席思想是革命的指路明灯，离开了毛主席思想的指导，我们就不能翻身，中国就不能解放，反动派就不能被打倒，帝国主义就不能最终被消灭”、“毛主席的书是真理，不读毛主席的书，怎叫听毛主席的话，不听毛主席的话，怎叫跟毛主席走。”有了阶级感情，明白了毛主席的书是干革命的书，就会产生强烈的学习愿望，就会越学越爱学。
    用甜头引。摆甜头，谈收获，讲进步，是吸引大家学习毛主席著作的又一个好方法。经过摆甜头，使大家更能亲切地体会到学习毛主席著作的威力。有一个老工人，过去常闹个人利益，每次评奖他都有意见。学习了毛主席著作，他的思想觉悟了，尝到了甜头，成了“学习迷”。晚上在家学习毛主席著作，同他的爱人发生了矛盾。他爱人说：“亮着灯，我睡不着觉。”他就先睡觉，等爱人睡着后，他起来开灯再学。这种刻苦学习的精神，感动了他的爱人。他爱人说：“毛主席著作这么大力量？真能把人迷住、粘住？”他说：“不信，你来试试。”他爱人一试，也入了迷，家庭关系起了新变化。我们就请这位老工人来摆甜头，他越摆越甜，启发了大家的学习自觉性。一九六五年，我们进行了两次全厂群众性的摆学习甜头活动。
    用骨干帮。我们在培训学习骨干的时候，要求骨干除自己带头学好以外，还要从多方面进行思想互助，用灵活多样的形式和方法，启发大家的学习自觉性。机车车间管工小组的学习骨干，有一天晚上，在单身宿舍引导大家讨论起“人的阶级性”。有一个一直不发言的工人感到了兴趣，他问大家“什么叫阶级？”学习骨干们说：“你说说看。”他满有把握地说：“阶级就是不一样的人，有剥削人的，有被人剥削的。”学习骨干们又问：“什么叫剥削呢？”他说：“地主大斗进，小斗出，就是剥削。”有人说：“要是用一样的斗呢？还是不是剥削呢？”他说：“不是。”这一句把全屋的人都逗笑了。会后，学习骨干找他谈心，帮助他讲清楚什么是阶级，什么是剥削，提高了认识，后来，这个工人也参加了学习小组。
    用典型推。我们经常请厂内外、路内外学习积极分子作报告，启发大家的学习自觉性。全路毛主席著作积极分子大会后，我们请了双目失明的孙桂兰讲了他学习毛主席著作的动人事迹，震动很大。老工人们说：“过去咱说眼花了，学不了，比人家没眼的，咱没的说了。”没文化的同志说：“过去总是说，没文化，学习毛主席著作有困难，看来不是困难大，是咱的毅力小。人家没眼的能学，咱有眼的就不能学吗？”有力地推动了大家的学习。
    在“用”字上狠下功夫
    在狠抓学习自觉性的基础上，我们又抓了怎样学的问题。怎么学？就得要在“用”字上狠下功夫。
    带着问题学，从改造思想入手。学习毛主席著作，必须带着问题学，在“用”字上狠下功夫。带着问题学，首先要带着思想问题；在“用”字上下功夫，首先要在改造思想上狠下功夫。学习毛主席著作，要想和自己的思想挂上钩，就必须放下思想包袱。在学习中，有的干部认为：“自己是干部，斗争经历长，对党贡献大，改造思想是别人的事，自己是帮助别人改造思想的。”有的同志说：“咱不会说，就会干，一不理财，二不管账，既不贪，又不粘，‘改造’那两字儿，没指咱的脑门儿说”。这些思想包袱，是学习毛主席著作，改造思想道路上的“拦路虎”。只有放下包袱，敢于暴露自己的思想，进行批评与自我批评，才能获得进步。有的职工说得好：“学习为了用，学了就革命，思想革了命，工作才主动”；“思想好，工作才能好，思想革命化，工作才能革命化。”
    学中用，用中学。有的同志说：“活学活用不能忘，忘了这条就转向。”广大干部和职工把毛主席著作看成是“行动的指南”，解决问题的“金钥匙”。大家学习的具体体会是：“勤学勤对照，遇事多请教，边学边总结，常把差距找。”
    动力车间副主任孙立祯同志，学习毛主席著作，长期坚持“巧用三余”（早起点，晚睡点，星期天少玩点），遇到问题就请教毛主席著作。一九六三年，工厂里买来了一套制氧设备，解体一看，是一部坏机器。为了使死机复活，孙立祯同志长期深入到工人群众中去，边劳动，边调查研究，同时，鼓励工人同志们发扬自力更生的精神，用愚公移山的精神来克服困难。干了一年多，终于让这台机器，于一九六四年十一月投入了生产。可是，到了十一月中旬，突然发现了分离塔进油问题。这个问题非同小可，如果发现的晚，使油蔓延，机器就有爆炸的危险。为了解决这个问题，工人们曾先后到北京、杭州等地，请“名师”，学“高艺”，但都没有找到可靠的解决办法。孙立祯同志组织大家学习了毛主席的《愚公移山》，使工人们认识到“要骑着困难走，不能绕着困难行。”有了克服困难的信心，他们就一连召开了五次“诸葛亮会”，进行了反复试验，最后，终于摸清了进油的原因，解决了这一难题。
    反复学，反复用。学习毛主席著作，要长期坚持，反复学，反复用，不断总结，步步提高。运输车间共产党员王玉安，为了解决小吊车的老关键，曾五次学习《愚公移山》，使机器恢复了青春。
    “四结合”，一对照，在组织职工学习毛主席著作的时候，我们一直提倡结合形势学，结合任务学，结合思想学，结合业务学。在学习中，看毛主席是怎样讲的，自己是怎样想的？进行对照，这样收获大，效果好。
    我们学习毛主席著作，还仅仅是开始，虽然有相当的收获，但还有不少的问题。一九六六年，我们将更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，把学习毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，进一步加强领导，在“用”字上狠下功夫，从根本上促进广大职工的思想革命化。
