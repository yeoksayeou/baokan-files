    Xinhua News Agency, 11th dispatch from Florence: U.S. Vice President Humphrey, in a conversation with Italian newspaper correspondents stationed in Washington, demanded that the Soviet revisionist leadership group further cooperate with the United States to achieve a ceasefire in Vietnam. He also once again clamored for "containing" China.
    Humphrey's remarks were published on the 10th in the Florentine newspaper *La Nazione* and the Bolognese newspaper *Il Resto del Carlino*. Humphrey said that the U.S. government is currently "carefully" seeking to improve relations with the Soviet Union. He said, "President Johnson has been making resolute efforts to make the Soviet Union understand our activities and to ask it, as a responsible nation, to seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict in Vietnam..."
    Humphrey demanded that the Soviet Union cooperate with the United States in seeking "a cessation of hostilities, a ceasefire, and ultimately peace." He said something along the lines of "If Moscow is willing to cooperate, it only needs to avoid encouraging North Vietnam to continue this battle..."
    Humphrey also said, "Even in the difficult years of the Vietnam War, we (the U.S. government) have consistently made efforts to maintain a correct attitude towards the Soviet Union, which is to respect its position and strength in the world and to encourage it to play its leading role in a responsible manner."
    When discussing the China issue, Humphrey once again promoted the so-called counter-revolutionary two-pronged tactics of "containment without isolation," saying, "I firmly believe that containing the aggressive militarism of Communist China is a necessary goal... We should be able to organize a collective security system... At the same time, we should maintain direct and indirect contact with the Chinese people."
    On the same day, U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Director Foster, in a television interview in Washington, advocated that the United States and the Soviet Union reach a deal on "non-proliferation of nuclear weapons" as soon as possible.
    Foster loudly touted the "urgency of non-proliferation" and emphasized that despite the existence of the Vietnam War and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization crisis, the United States and the Soviet Union "could sign a (non-proliferation of nuclear weapons) treaty, perhaps as early as this year." Foster said that he had told the Russians that the real danger zone was not in Western Europe. He said, "The danger is elsewhere in the world, where there is no such unified command, such restraint and control."

    汉弗莱再次叫嚷要推行反革命两手策略
    鼓吹苏美合作实现越南停火并“遏制”中国
    福斯特大肆叫嚷要苏美尽快达成“不扩散核武器”交易
    新华社十一日讯　佛罗伦萨消息：美国副总统汉弗莱在一次对意大利报纸驻华盛顿记者的谈话中，要求苏联修正主义领导集团进一步同美国合作，实现越南停火。他还再次鼓吹“遏制”中国。
    汉弗莱的这次谈话十日发表在意大利佛罗伦萨的《民族报》和波伦亚的《卡利诺雷斯托》报上。汉弗莱说，美国政府目前正在“小心谨慎地”谋求改善同苏联的关系。他说，“约翰逊总统一直在作坚决的努力以使苏联了解我们的活动情况，请它以一个负责国家的身份来谋求和平解决越南的冲突……”。
    汉弗莱要求苏联在谋求“停止敌对行动、实现停火和最后取得和平”方面同美国合作。他说什么“如果莫斯科愿意合作的话，它只要避免鼓励北越继续进行这场战斗就够了……”。
    汉弗莱还说，“即使在越南战争的困难年月里，我们（美国政府）也一贯作出努力来保持对苏联的正确态度，这就是尊重它在世界上的地位和力量及鼓励它以负责的态度发挥其领导作用”。
    在谈到中国问题时，汉弗莱再次宣扬所谓“遏制而不孤立”的反革命两手策略，他说“我坚决相信，遏制共产党中国的侵略性军国主义是一个必要的奋斗目标……我们应当能够组织一种集体安全的体系……同时，我们应当同中国人民保持直接和间接的接触。”
    同一天，美国军备监督和裁军署署长福斯特在华盛顿的一次电视谈话中鼓吹美、苏两国尽快在“不扩散核武器”方面达成交易。
    福斯特大肆鼓吹“不扩散的迫切性”，并强调尽管存在着越南战争以及北大西洋公约组织危机，美国和苏联“有可能签订（不扩散核武器）条约，也许早在今年”。福斯特说，他已对俄国人说过，真正的危险地区不是在西欧。他说，“危险是在世界的其他地方，是在不存在那样一种联合司令部、那样一种克制和控制的地方”。
