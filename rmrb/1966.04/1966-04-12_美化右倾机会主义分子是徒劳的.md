　　吴晗同志编写《海瑞罢官》的时期，正是我国经济遭到暂时困难，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派发动反华高潮，国内外阶级敌人乘机又一次向社会主义猖狂进攻的时期。当时右倾机会主义者大肆叫嚣：人民公社办早了，大跃进搞糟了，等等，攻击伟大的党，攻击社会主义。他们的这种恶毒的攻击，象一阵阵阴风毒气，到处传扬。但是人民的眼睛是雪亮的，绝不会受其欺骗。在党和毛主席的领导下，全国人民怀着愤怒的心情，展开了反右倾机会主义的斗争。右倾机会主义者在群众的揭露下，显露出他们丑恶的原形。人民撤了他们的职，罢了他们的官。
　　《海瑞罢官》把海瑞描绘成一个劳动人民的救世主，实行“退田”、“平冤狱”等等“拯救人民”的措施，得到人民的爱戴和颂扬。戏中还写着，正是这样一位贫苦人民的救星，却被罢了官，这是多么令人惋惜和愤慨的事啊！十分明显，吴晗同志要写这些，为的就是通过他所精心捏造的海瑞这个高大的形象，来美化右倾机会主义分子，并且鼓励他们不要灰心丧气，不要“灰溜溜”地走掉，要失败了再干。
　　当人们揭穿了吴晗同志的真面貌以后，他又耍花招了。说什么他写《海瑞罢官》的目的是不清楚的，思想是糊涂的，做了一番假检讨。我们说，你再耍花招也是徒劳的。你文章一篇一篇地做，书一本一本地写，哪里是糊涂呢？难道你不通过大脑就能写出文章来吗？真是欺人之谈。《海瑞罢官》是一株大毒草，必须把它连根拔掉。

At the time Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," China was experiencing temporary economic difficulties, and imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries launched an anti-China upsurge. Domestic and foreign class enemies seized the opportunity to launch another frenzied attack on socialism. At that time, right opportunists clamored that the people's communes had been established too early, the Great Leap Forward had been ruined, and so on, attacking the great Party and attacking socialism. Their vicious attacks spread everywhere like gusts of sinister wind and poisonous gas. But the people's eyes are discerning and will never be deceived. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country, with angry hearts, launched a struggle against right opportunism. Under the exposure of the masses, the right opportunists revealed their ugly true colors. The people removed them from their posts and dismissed them from their offices.
　　"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" portrays Hai Rui as a savior of the working people, implementing measures such as "returning land" and "redressing unjust verdicts" to "save the people," earning the love and praise of the people. The play also writes that such a savior of the poor people was dismissed from office, which is such a regrettable and indignant thing! It is very obvious that Comrade Wu Han wanted to write these things in order to glorify right opportunists through the tall image of Hai Rui that he carefully fabricated, and to encourage them not to be discouraged, not to "sneak away," but to try again after failing.
　　After people exposed Comrade Wu Han's true face, he played tricks again. He claimed that his purpose in writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was unclear, his thinking was muddled, and he made a false self-criticism. We say that your tricks are in vain. You write articles one by one, and write books one by one. Where is the confusion? Can you write articles without using your brain? What a deceitful talk! "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a big poisonous weed and must be uprooted.

    美化右倾机会主义分子是徒劳的
