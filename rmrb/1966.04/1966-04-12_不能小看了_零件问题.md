Title: "The 'Parts Problem' Should Not Be Underestimated"

    The following rural letters reflect that in some areas, the supply of agricultural machinery parts is insufficient, affecting the normal progress of agricultural production. They hope that industrial departments will pay attention to both the production of complete machines and the production of "small parts" for maintenance.

    Since the spring drought, the winter paddies have gradually cracked, seriously threatening our team's spring plowing and sowing. Originally, after the people's commune was established, our team built some water conservancy projects, installed four water turbine pumps, and bought four water pumps, so we could completely resist general droughts. However, of the four water pumps, only one can be used now, and the other three cannot work due to the damage of some small parts. Watching the fields crack day by day and being unable to prepare the rice paddies really makes me feel very flustered.
    We sent people everywhere to find them and looked for many hardware stores but couldn't buy them, and we couldn't solve the problem by looking for the county agricultural tool factory either. I also asked the county hydroelectric bureau and the county materials station, but neither could solve the problem. The comrades at the materials station said, "We only supply complete sets of equipment now, and we don't sell parts." The comrades at the hydroelectric bureau said, "We have also run around to many places to buy them, and we have also reported to the prefectural water conservancy bureau and made plans for the county materials station, but neither can solve the problem. The 8.8-type water pump has now stopped production, so there may no longer be a supply of parts."
    I think this situation is obviously abnormal. If industrial departments only pay attention to the production and supply of complete sets of machinery and equipment and ignore the production and supply of parts, it will cause a situation where many machines are produced, but few are actually used, causing serious waste to the production team. We urgently hope that the production and supply departments of agricultural machinery will produce and supply more parts for agricultural water pumps.

    When we go to the countryside to help production teams prevent and control fruit tree diseases and insect pests, we often miss the opportunity for prevention and control because we cannot buy accessories after the parts of the high-pressure sprayers are damaged. We also have a situation where the parts of other agricultural tools are not supplied here. Farmers say: "In the past few years, we couldn't buy parts for the carts, so we had to put the carts aside when they were broken; now that the parts for the carts have been supplied in large quantities, it is much more convenient for rural transportation than in the past. It would be great if the parts for high-pressure sprayers and other agricultural tools could also be supplied." We believe that the farmer's request is worth noting. We hope that agricultural tool manufacturing departments should produce some parts, especially parts that are easily damaged or lost, when producing various agricultural tools. Agricultural tool supply departments should also purchase corresponding parts when purchasing various agricultural tools.

    In recent years, the industrial departments have produced many high-quality and low-priced machines for the countryside, which greatly saved labor and strongly supported agricultural production. However, some factories only pay attention to supplying complete machines to the countryside and do not pay attention to supplying machine parts, resulting in great losses to agriculture. For example, the Tianjin Cotton Machinery Factory supplied a batch of 20-type brush-type saw ginning machines to our county last year, but there were no spare parts for maintenance. Our station sent several letters and also sent a parts plan with the letter, but we have not received a reply for a long time. There are many similar examples. In this way, if the parts of the machine are broken, they cannot be repaired and cannot be used. We suggest that relevant leaders pay attention to grasping the production and supply of accessories, and hope that the factory will help us solve the problem of accessories for ginning machines.

### 不能小看了“零件问题”

    不能小看了“零件问题”
    几封农村来信，反映有些地区农业机械的零件供应不足，影响了农业生产的正常进行，他们希望工业部门既要重视整机的生产，也要重视维修用的“小零件”的生产。
    一
    春旱以来，泡冬田逐渐干裂，严重地威胁着我们队的春耕播种。本来我们队在人民公社化以后，兴修了一些水利工程，安装了四部水轮泵，又买了四台抽水机，一般的干旱是完全可以抗御的。但是，四台抽水机，现在只有一台能够使用，其余三台都因一些小的零件损坏而不能工作。眼看着田土一天天干裂，秧田整不出来，真使我心里非常发慌。
    我们派人到处奔走、寻找了好多五金店没买到，找过县农具厂也没办法解决。我又问过县水电局和县物资站，都无法解决。物资站的同志说：“我们现在只有成套设备供应，没有零件出售”。水电局的同志说：“我们也跑了好多地方买不到，也给专区水利局反映过，也给县物资站造过计划，但都无法解决。8、8型的抽水机现在已经停止生产，可能不会再有零件供应”。
    我想，这种情况显然是不正常的。工业部门只注意成套机器设备的生产和供应，忽视零件的生产和供应，这样就会造成生产的机器多，而真正在使用的机器却很少的情况，给生产队造成严重的浪费。我们迫切希望农业机械的生产部门和供应部门，为农业抽水机多生产和供应些零件。        贵州绥阳县雅泉公社保铃大队　孙九茂

    我们下乡帮助生产队防治果树病虫害的时候，常常由于高压喷雾器的零件损坏以后买不到配件，因此误了防治时机。我们这里其他农具的零件也有供应不上的情况。农民说：“前几年买不到架子车的零件，车子坏了只好搁起来；现在架子车的零件已经大量供应，农村搞运输就比过去方便多了，如果高压喷雾器和其他农具的零件也能得到供应，那就好了。”我们认为农民的这个要求是值得注意的。希望农具制造部门在生产各种农具时，应该生产一部分零件，特别是容易损坏丢失的零件。农具供应部门在采购各种农具时，也应该采购相应的零件。

    三
    近几年来，工业部门给农村生产了很多质高价廉的机器，大大的节约了劳动力，有力地支援了农业生产。但是，有些工厂只注意供给农村整部机器，而不注意供给机器的零配件，结果给农业造成很大的损失。例如天津棉花机械制造厂，去年供应我县一批20型毛刷式锯齿轧花机，就没有维修用的零配件，我站连去数封信，又随信寄去配件计划，但很久未见答复。类似这样的事例很多，这样，机器的零件一坏了就不能修理，不能使用了。我们建议有关领导重视抓好配件的生产和供应工作，并希望工厂帮助我们解决轧花机的配件问题。
