Editor's Note: The so-called great debate on China policy currently underway in the United States is a clumsy farce. Despite the many characters on stage chattering and making jokes, there are no new tricks. It merely reflects the embarrassing predicament of the American ruling clique, who are at a dead end in their China policy.

Washington launched this great debate at this time because American imperialism has come to regard socialist China, which holds high the banner of anti-imperialist revolution, as its "number one enemy." The Johnson administration is determined to implement a policy of intensified hostility towards China, but this policy is extremely unpopular both at home and abroad. Therefore, the rulers in Washington need to use some irrelevant talk to confuse public opinion and conceal their intensified anti-China activities and deployments.

The Chinese people understand the essence of American imperialism. We know that American imperialism cannot escape the logic of making trouble, failing, making trouble again, and failing again, until its demise. No matter how many walls it hits, how many more walls it will continue to hit, and no matter how fiercely the American ruling clique argues, the American imperialist policy of hostility towards China will not change. The Chinese people harbor no illusions about American imperialism. No matter what tricks American imperialism plays, whether soft or hard, it cannot shake our firm stance of resolutely fighting against the aggressive policies and war policies of American imperialism to the end.

In the past two months, a major debate on China policy has unfolded in the United States. For a time, court scholars, strategists, and responsible officials appeared one after another, and opinions were divided, turning the so-called "China problem" into the center of attention.

Starting in late January, the Subcommittee on Far East and Pacific Affairs of the House Foreign Affairs Committee successively held multiple hearings on China policy. Subsequently, starting in early March, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee invited so-called "China problem experts" to testify. Some American universities, colleges, "academic" groups, and other "civilian" groups, as well as religious figures, also held many large and small discussion meetings, discussing the so-called "China problem." At the same time, American President Johnson and some senior officials also delivered multiple speeches on China policy.

Worried that expanding the war of aggression in Vietnam would "collide with China"

In fact, this discussion is a continuation of the great debate on the Vietnam issue in the previous period. The risks caused by the Johnson administration's continuous expansion of the war of aggression in Vietnam are a direct reason for their raising the so-called "China problem." This aggressive adventure has not only been strongly opposed by the broad masses of the American people, but has also caused panic among some within the American ruling clique. They are worried that this will lead to a "collision with China," and once "collided," it would be "possibly the worst disaster for the rest of this century" for the United States.

A more profound reason why American China policy has aroused such widespread discussion domestically is that the policy of hostility towards China pursued by American imperialism cannot prevent China from advancing rapidly along the path of socialist revolution and construction, nor can it prevent the continuous expansion of the influence of the Chinese revolution. The anti-China betrayal activities of the Soviet revisionist leading group have not helped it either. China, which holds high the banner of anti-imperialist revolution, has become the biggest obstacle that American imperialism cannot overcome in implementing its counter-revolutionary global strategy. William Bundy, Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs, said on February 12 that the foreign policy objectives of China and the United States are "diametrically opposed" and that "there are very fundamental contradictions." He admitted that "Communist China is the most serious and troublesome problem facing our foreign policy today."

It can be seen that this great debate in the United States does not reflect its "strength," but rather its weakness and failure, reflecting its helplessness and impasse in the face of the great Chinese people. Some influential figures in the United States have also continuously criticized American China policy as "fundamentally unsuccessful" and "outdated," and that "our China policy should be fundamentally reviewed," etc. Under these circumstances, the Johnson administration is attempting to use this debate as a smokescreen to divert domestic and international dissatisfaction with American anti-China policy and to conceal America's continued pursuit of a policy of hostility and aggression towards China.

Different anti-China methods, unchanged anti-China essence

The discussion process shows that these strategists are only arguing about what counter-revolutionary methods to adopt, but they are completely unanimous in adhering to the policy of hostility and aggression towards China. Because of this, no one can come up with any brilliant tricks, and none of these clumsy new magicians can come up with a workable idea. The result of the experts' repeated deliberations is still one thing: to continue and intensify the policy of "containment" of China that the government has been pursuing. At the same time, they added a sentence after "containment," called "non-isolation," to form a so-called "containment without isolation" formula. But what exactly is this formula?

First of all, the policy of "containment" of China is the core of American China policy. Since the Johnson administration came to power, it has taken this policy a step further. It openly declared China as the main enemy of the United States and shifted the focus of its global strategy from Europe to Asia. In addition to intensifying the operation of the so-called "crescent line of defense" from South Korea to Thailand, it is also increasingly pinning its hopes on colluding with Khrushchev revisionists, Japanese militarists, and Indian reactionaries to "contain" China.

The American policy of "containing" China also has its ulterior motives, that is, to wave the black flag of anti-China, further intensify control over a series of countries around China, suppress the revolutionary movements in these countries, and turn them into American military bases. Bundy stated this very bluntly in his speech on February 12. He said in a threatening tone, "Without a major and direct contribution from the United States militarily, there could not be an effective military deterrent force around China's borders today." At the same time, he also emphasized that "containment" of China is a "containment that must depend on the actions of Asian countries themselves."

So, what is the so-called "non-isolation"? Professor Barnett, acting chairman of the East Asian Institute of Columbia University, proposed at the first China policy hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on March 8 that the United States should insist on using force to "contain" China while "maximizing contact with China and involving them in the international community to the greatest extent possible." This proposal caused quite a stir in American political circles, and many people echoed it. American Vice President Humphrey also mentioned in a speech on March 19: "We must contain Asian communism without isolating the Chinese people."

The so-called "containment without isolation" is a vain attempt to "peacefully evolve" China

In fact, the so-called "containment without isolation" formula is merely a manifestation of American imperialism's counter-revolutionary dual tactics in its China policy. In short, this is to continue to invade and surround China, contain and isolate China, while vainly attempting to promote China's "peaceful evolution" and gradually degenerate the Chinese revolution. And "containment" is the main thing in these two hands. The Christian Science Monitor pointed out in its commentary on this proposal on March 6 that the American military policy of "containing" China "has not changed. On the contrary, as a result of the Vietnam War, this policy has been strengthened"; however, the Johnson administration "hopes that while implementing this policy, it will implement a long-term policy... to lead these (Chinese) communists to take the path Russia took from Stalin to Brezhnev, abandoning violence and adopting the necessary responsible attitude." This reveals the counter-revolutionary essence of the so-called "containment without isolation" policy in one word.

However, American imperialism has chosen the wrong target. The Chinese people have long seen through the aggressive nature of American imperialism. Neither the "hard" hand nor the "soft" hand, nor the "both hard and soft" hands can overwhelm or deceive the Chinese people. Even the American ruling clique is quite weak about whether this set of methods of the United States can work. Bundy said on March 16 that the United States has been taking measures in accordance with this policy for some time in terms of the "containment without isolation" policy. However, he admitted that there is no sign that China will change its policy.

The "Two Chinas" policy will not work

In a state of boredom, Harvard University professor and veteran "China problem authority" Fairbank and others also brought out the "Two Chinas" plan, which had long been moldy. They advocated "negotiating with the People's Republic of China to establish comprehensive and formal diplomatic relations while maintaining relations with Taiwan," "accepting the Beijing government into the United Nations," etc. In addition, there are also some people who advocate holding "unconditional discussions" with China, establishing "diplomatic relations" first and then discussing the future of Taiwan, etc., in various forms. However, even Rusk had to admit that the proposal to propose "Two Chinas" was "useless" due to China's opposition.

It is not surprising that American imperialism insists on being hostile to the Chinese people. What is strange is that it even wants to find a "way out" in the dead end of China policy. This great debate on China policy in the United States once again shows that this is just a fantasy.

### 华盛顿关于对华政策的大讨论说明了什么？  美国在反华死胡同里找不到出路

    华盛顿关于对华政策的大讨论说明了什么？
    美国在反华死胡同里找不到出路
    编者按　正在美国国内进行的所谓对华政策大讨论，是一场蹩脚的滑稽剧。尽管满台角色七嘴八舌，插科打诨，也没有什么新噱头。它只不过反映出了美国统治集团在对华政策的死胡同中走投无路的狼狈处境罢了。
    华盛顿在这个时候展开这样一场大讨论，是因为美帝国主义已经把高举反帝革命旗帜的社会主义中国看成是它的“头号敌人”。约翰逊政府决心要实行变本加厉地敌视中国的政策，而这种政策却在美国国内外极不得人心，因而华盛顿的统治者需要用一些不着边际的空谈来迷惑舆论，掩盖它正在加紧策划的反华活动和部署。
    中国人民是从本质上认识美帝国主义的。我们知道，美帝国主义无论如何离不开捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡的逻辑。不管它碰了多少壁，继续还要碰多少壁，也不管美国统治集团内部争吵得多么激烈，还要争吵得多么激烈，美帝国主义敌视中国的政策是不会改变的。中国人民对美帝国主义不存任何幻想。不论美帝国主义耍什么花招，软的也好，硬的也好，都不可能动摇我们坚决同美帝国主义侵略政策和战争政策斗争到底的坚定立场。
    最近两个月来，美国国内展开了一场关于对华政策的大讨论。一时御用学者、谋臣策士和负责官员相继出场，议论纷纭，把所谓“中国问题”变成了注意的中心。
    从一月下旬开始，美国众议院外交委员会远东和太平洋事务小组委员会陆续举行了多次对华政策意见听取会；接着，参议院外交委员会从三月初开始，先后邀请了一些所谓“中国问题专家”出席作证。美国的一些大学学院、“学术性”团体及其他“民间”团体，宗教界人士，也分别举行了大大小小的许多讨论会，议论所谓“中国问题”。同时，美国总统约翰逊和一些高级官员也多次发表了关于对华政策的讲话。
    担心扩大侵越战争会“同中国相撞”
    事实上，这场讨论是前一时期越南问题大辩论的继续。约翰逊政府不断扩大侵越战争所引起的风险是促使他们提出所谓“中国问题”的一个直接原因。这种侵略冒险不仅遭到美国广大人民的强烈反对，也在美国统治集团内部的一些人当中引起了恐慌。他们担心，这会导致“同中国相撞”，而一旦“相撞”，对美国来说，将是“可能在本世纪余下的时间里出现的最坏不过的灾难”。
    美国对华政策之所以在国内引起如此广泛的议论，一个更深远的原因是，美帝国主义奉行的敌视中国的政策，阻挡不了中国沿着社会主义革命和建设的道路突飞猛进，阻挡不了中国革命影响的不断扩大。苏联修正主义领导集团的反华叛卖活动，也帮不了它的忙。高举反帝革命大旗的中国，已成了美帝国主义推行其反革命全球战略不可逾越的最大障碍。美国负责远东事务助理国务卿威·邦迪二月十二日就说，中美两国的外交政策目的是“针锋相对”的，“存在着十分根本性的矛盾”。他承认，“共产党中国是我们外交政策今天所面临的最严重和最麻烦的问题。”
    由此可见，美国搞这次大讨论，并不反映它的“强大”，而是反映它的虚弱和失败，反映它在伟大的中国人民面前一筹莫展，走投无路。美国一些有势力人物也不断批评美国对华政策“基本上是不成功的”，“早已过时了”，应该“从根本上审查我们的对华政策”等等。在这种情况下，约翰逊政府企图利用这次辩论作为一种烟幕，来转移国内外对美国反华政策的强烈不满，掩盖美国继续奉行敌视和侵略中国的政策。
    反华方法不同，反华实质不变
    讨论的过程表明，这些谋臣策士争论的只是采取什么反革命方法的问题，而在坚持敌视和侵略中国的政策上则是毫无二致的。正因为如此，谁也变不出什么漂亮的戏法，这些蹩脚的新魔术师们，谁也拿不出一套行得通的主意来，专家们反复推敲的结果，最后还是一条：把官方一直在推行的“遏制”中国的政策，继续和加紧执行下去。同时，他们又在“遏制”的后面，补充了一句，叫作“不予孤立”，凑成一个所谓“遏制而不予孤立”的公式。而这个公式究竟是什么货色呢？
    首先，“遏制”中国的政策，是美国对华政策的核心。约翰逊政府上台以来，又把这一政策向前推进了一步。它公开宣称中国是美国的主要敌人，并把它的全球战略重点从欧洲转移到亚洲。它除了加紧经营从南朝鲜到泰国的所谓“新月形防线”，还在越来越多地寄希望于勾结赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、日本军国主义者和印度反动派来“遏制”中国。
    美国的“遏制”中国政策，还有其不可告人的目的，那就是，挥舞反华的黑旗，进一步加紧控制中国周围的一系列国家，镇压这些国家的革命运动，把它们变成美国的军事基地。这一点，邦迪在二月十二日的演说中说得十分露骨。他以吓唬人的口吻说，“要是没有美国在军事上作出重大和直接的贡献，今天在中国国境的周围不可能有一支有效的军事威慑力量。”同时他又强调：对中国的“遏制”是一种“要取决于亚洲国家自己的行动的遏制”。
    那么，所谓“不予孤立”又是怎么一回事呢？哥伦比亚大学东亚学会代理会长巴尼特教授在三月八日参院外委会的第一次对华政策意见听取会上提出，美国应当坚持以武力“遏制”中国的同时，“最大限度地同中国接触，并且使他们最大限度地卷入国际大家庭”。这个主张提出后，在美国政界颇为轰动，附和者颇有人在。美国副总统汉弗莱在三月十九日的一次演说里也谈到：“我们必须实现遏制亚洲共产主义，而不孤立中国人民。”
    所谓“遏制而不予孤立”，就是妄想中国“和平演变”
    实际上，所谓“遏制而不予孤立”的公式，不过是美帝国主义反革命两手策略在对华政策上的表现。简言之，这就是一面继续侵略和包围中国，遏制和孤立中国，一面妄想促进中国的“和平演变”，逐步使中国革命变质。而在这两手中又以“遏制”为主。《基督教科学箴言报》三月六日在评论这一主张时指出，美国军事“遏制”中国的政策“没有改变。相反，由于越南战争的结果，这种政策加强了”；但是，约翰逊政府“希望在实行这一政策的同时，实行一种长期的政策……以导致这些（中国）共产党人走上俄国在斯大林到勃列日涅夫期间走过的道路，抛弃暴力而采取必要的负责态度”。这就一语道破了所谓“遏制而不予孤立”政策的反革命实质。
    但是，美帝国主义找错了对象。中国人民早就看透了美帝国主义的侵略本质，无论是“硬”的一手，还是“软”的一手，还是“软硬兼施”，都压不倒和骗不了中国人民。对于美国这一套办法能否奏效，连美国统治集团也是颇为心虚的。邦迪三月十六日说，就“遏制而不予孤立”的政策而言，美国一些时候以来，一直是按这一方针采取措施的。但是，他承认，并没有迹象表明中国会改变政策。
    “两个中国”此路不通
    在百无聊赖的情况下，哈佛大学教授、老牌“中国问题权威”费正清等人这次把早已霉烂不堪的“两个中国”的方案也搬了出来。他们鼓吹“在同台湾保持关系的同时，就同中华人民共和国建立全面的、正式的外交关系进行谈判”，“接纳北京政府进入联合国”等等。另外也还有一些人鼓吹什么同中国举行“无条件讨论”、先“建交”后讨论台湾前途等等，形形色色，不一而足。但是，连腊斯克也不得不承认，由于中国反对，提出“两个中国”的建议是“没有用处的”。
    美帝国主义坚持敌视中国人民，这是它的反动、侵略本质所决定了的，毫不足怪。奇怪的是，它竟然想在对华政策的死胡同里寻找“出路”。美国这次对华政策的大讨论又一次表明，这不过是幻想。
