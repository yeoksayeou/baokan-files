    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan – The wild fish species, Bluntnose Black Bream, which grows in small quantities in the lakes of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has now been cultivated in breeding farms in thirteen provinces (and regions), including Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, after domestication experiments by fish researchers.
    The Bluntnose Black Bream is a type of bream (鲂鱼), belonging to the bream family (鳊鱼类). Bream and bream fish are known for their delicious and fatty flesh since ancient times. The "Wuchang Fish," praised throughout Jiangnan as early as the Three Kingdoms period, refers to the bream and bream fish produced in Liangzi Lake near Fankou Town, Echeng County (formerly known as Wuchang County), Hubei. In 1955, fish researchers at the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences discovered it in Liangzi Lake. After years of field observation and artificial breeding, they believe that this is an excellent fish species among China's freshwater fish that can be artificially cultured in large quantities, and they have initially explored a set of technical experience for domestic breeding and reproduction.
    The results of breeding research show that Bluntnose Black Bream grow relatively quickly. Starting from fish fry, they can become commercial fish weighing about one catty in two years, which is one year earlier than grass carp and black carp. The Bluntnose Black Bream also has a high reproductive capacity. Its gonads mature one to two years earlier than the four major domestic fish (grass carp, black carp, silver carp, and bighead carp). Male fish mature after two years of breeding, and female fish begin to lay eggs and reproduce after three years. Each female fish can lay 50,000 to 80,000 eggs, with a high hatching rate. The eggs of the Bluntnose Black Bream are sticky and can adhere to aquatic plants or artificially placed willow roots and other objects. Therefore, artificial breeding of Bluntnose Black Bream does not require special spawning ponds and incubation equipment like artificial breeding of the four major domestic fish.
    The main food of Bluntnose Black Bream is zooplankton during the fry stage, various duckweeds during the fingerling stage, and grass and phytoplankton as adults. From the fingerling stage to adulthood, the Bluntnose Black Bream has strong resistance to bacterial fish diseases, especially bacterial enteritis, so the survival rate can generally reach about 90%.

### 野生名鱼团头鲂在十三省区养殖  团头鲂是誉遍江南的“武昌鱼”的同类

    野生名鱼团头鲂在十三省区养殖
    团头鲂是誉遍江南的“武昌鱼”的同类
    新华社武汉电　一种少量生长在长江中游湖泊中的野生鱼类——团头鲂，经过鱼类研究人员的驯化试验，现在已经在湖北、江苏、浙江等十三个省（区）的养殖场开始养殖。
    团头鲂是鲂鱼的一种，属鳊鱼类。鳊鱼和鲂鱼肉肥味美，自古闻名。早在三国时代誉遍江南的“武昌鱼”，就是指湖北鄂城县（古称武昌县）樊口镇附近梁子湖所产的鳊鲂。一九五五年，中国科学院水生生物研究所鱼类研究人员，在梁子湖发现后，经过多年的野外观察和人工饲养，认为这是我国淡水鱼类中可以用人工大量养殖的一个优良鱼种，并已初步摸索到一套家养繁殖的技术经验。
    饲养研究的结果表明：团头鲂生长速度较快，从鱼苗开始饲养，两年就可成为一斤左右的商品鱼，比草鱼和青鱼可提早一年。团头鲂的繁殖力也较高。它的性腺比青、草、鲢、鳙四大家鱼提早一到两年成熟，雄鱼饲养两年就成熟，雌鱼三年开始产卵繁殖。每尾雌鱼可产卵五万到八万颗，孵化率较高。团头鲂的卵富有粘性，能够附着在水生植物或人工设置的柳树根等物体上。所以人工养殖团头鲂，不象人工养殖四大家鱼那样，要设置特殊的产卵池和孵化设备。
    团头鲂的主要食料，在幼鱼期是水中浮游动物，在鱼种阶段为各种浮萍，成鱼为草和浮游植物。团头鲂从鱼种期到成鱼，对细菌性鱼病特别是细菌性肠炎，具有较强的抵抗力，所以成活率一般可高达百分之九十左右。
