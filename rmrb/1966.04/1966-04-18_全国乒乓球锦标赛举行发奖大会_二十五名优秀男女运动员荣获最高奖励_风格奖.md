    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 16th. The 1966 National Table Tennis Championships held an awards ceremony tonight at the Jiangwan Stadium in Shanghai.
    At the ceremony, Cao Diqiu, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Shanghai, presented the "Style Award" to twenty-five outstanding male and female athletes from various regions. The conference also awarded prizes to the winners of the men's and women's team events and the five individual events of this championship.
    The "Style Award" is the highest award of this championship. The common characteristics of the athletes who won the "Style Award" are: highlighting politics in the competition, adhering to the use of Mao Zedong Thought to command technology, and performing well in competition style, organizational discipline, and life management.
    Each of the twenty-four provincial, municipal, and autonomous region teams participating in this championship had one (Shanghai had two) athlete receive the "Style Award". They are: Zhuang Zedong (Beijing), Chen Wenquan (Shandong), Chen Baoqing (Jiangsu), Jin Ronghu (Zhejiang), Zheng Huaiying (Fujian), Cheng Jinli (Anhui), Su Guoxi (Guangdong), He Zubin (Hubei), Feng Lianen (Henan), Han Renping (Hunan), Li Zhuomin (Guangxi), Yan Guifen (Sichuan), Wang Jiasheng (Guizhou), Zhang Qingzhen (Yunnan), Li Jingguang (Hebei), Yao Guozhi (Heilongjiang), Li Deyang (Liaoning), Liu Yucheng (Jilin), Wang Shufan (Jiangxi), Zhao Changguo (Gansu), Li Jishu (Shaanxi), Ci Yuying (Qinghai), Yu Xiuping (Shanxi), Yu Yize (Shanghai), Zheng Minzhi (Shanghai). Among them, the oldest is twenty-five years old, the youngest is fourteen years old, and newcomers account for 40%. There are seventeen Communist Party members and Communist Youth League members.
    World Men's Singles Champion Zhuang Zedong was humble and eager to learn in this competition, and treated every game and every ball seriously. On the field, he further promoted the "little tiger" style of daring to fight and daring to struggle, and carefully learned from the strengths of others. Zhuang Zedong also cared very much about the growth of newcomers. In addition to the competition, he often had heart-to-heart talks with newcomers, accompanied them to practice, passed on skills, and, more importantly, helped newcomers improve their thinking, which was unanimously praised by the audience and athletes. Li Jishu from the Shaanxi team, an eighteen-year-old who participated in a national competition for the first time, insisted on studying Chairman Mao's works and quotations every day during the competition, further establishing the idea of playing for the revolution and striving for glory for the collective and the country. He never cared about personal gains or losses, so he promoted the revolutionary spirit of daring to fight in the competition, demonstrating a very high style. Yu Xiuping, a newcomer with a horizontal grip and offensive style, when she failed in the women's team competition against the Hebei team, did not focus on technology, but first studied Chairman Mao's works, looked for reasons in her thinking, overcame some incorrect ideas caused by losing the ball, and established the idea of daring to struggle and daring to win. In the team competition with Beijing Team One, she displayed her power and defeated Li Li, a famous player from Beijing, with a score of 2-0. The outstanding deeds of other athletes who won the Style Award have also been well received by the audience. Many athletes have expressed that they want to learn from them.
    After the awards ceremony, some famous table tennis coaches and outstanding athletes gave wonderful performances.

    全国乒乓球锦标赛举行发奖大会
    二十五名优秀男女运动员荣获最高奖励“风格奖”
    新华社上海十六日电　一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛今晚在上海江湾体育馆举行发奖大会。
    会上，中共上海市委书记处书记、上海市市长曹荻秋向各地的二十五名优秀男、女运动员发了“风格奖”。大会还给这次锦标赛的男、女团体赛和五个单项比赛的优胜者发了奖。
    “风格奖”是这次锦标赛的最高奖励。获得“风格奖”的运动员共同特点是：在比赛中突出政治，坚持用毛泽东思想统帅技术，比赛风格、组织纪律和生活管理等方面也都表现得很好。
    参加这次锦标赛的二十四个省、市、自治区的球队都有一名（上海有两名）运动员获得“风格奖”。他们是：庄则栋（北京）、陈文泉（山东）、陈宝庆（江苏）、金荣虎（浙江）、郑怀颖（福建）、程晋黎（安徽）、苏国熙（广东）、何祖斌（湖北）、冯连恩（河南）、韩仁萍（湖南）、李卓敏（广西）、鄢桂芬（四川）、王家声（贵州）、张庆珍（云南）、李景光（河北）、姚国志（黑龙江）、李德洋（辽宁）、刘玉成（吉林）、王树蕃（江西）、赵昌国（甘肃）、李济蜀（陕西）、慈玉英（青海）、于秀萍（山西）、于贻泽（上海）、郑敏之（上海）。他们之中，年龄最大的二十五岁，最小的十四岁，新手占百分之四十。共产党员、共青团员共有十七人。
    世界男子单打冠军庄则栋在这次比赛中谦虚好学，认真严肃地对待每场比赛和每一个球，在赛场上进一步发扬了敢打敢拼的“小老虎”风格，而且认真留心学习别人的长处。庄则栋还十分关心新手们的成长，在比赛之余，常常同新手们促膝谈心，陪同新手们练球，传球艺，更主要的帮助新手们提高思想，受到观众和运动员们一致的赞扬。第一次参加全国性比赛的十八岁的陕西队李济蜀，在比赛期间每天坚持学习毛主席著作和语录，进一步树立为革命打球、为集体和国家争光的思想，从不计较个人的输赢得失，因此在比赛中发扬了敢搏敢打的革命精神，打出了很高的风格。横握球拍攻击型新手于秀萍，在女子团体赛和河北队交手失败时，不是从技术上着眼，而是首先学习毛主席著作，从思想上找原因，克服了因输球而产生的一些不正确的念头，树立了敢于斗争，敢于胜利的思想。在同北京一队进行团体赛时，她发挥了威力，以二比零战胜北京名手李莉。其他获得风格奖的运动员所表现的优秀事迹，也都受到观众的好评。许多运动员纷纷表示要向他们学习。
    发奖以后，一些著名的乒乓球教练和优秀运动员作了精采的表演。
