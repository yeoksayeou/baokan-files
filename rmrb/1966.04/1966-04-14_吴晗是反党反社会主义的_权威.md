Title: Wu Han is an Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist "Authority"

    Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are outright poisonous weeds. Their spearhead is aimed at the Party and socialism. These works are opposed to the Party Central Committee and Mao Zedong Thought. Connecting these poisonous weeds with the situation around the Lushan Conference, their true colors are revealed.
    In 1959, when right opportunist elements were saying that "the people's communes are a mess" and "the Great Leap Forward has failed," fiercely denouncing the Party and socialism, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." In this article, Wu Han makes no class analysis at all and even cut out the historical fact of Hai Rui crying to the emperor, portraying Hai Rui as an "opposition" figure supported by the people, greatly praising him. The social effect of publishing this article at that time could only be to support the right opportunist elements, vainly attempting to scold down the Three Red Banners.
    When the right opportunist elements' anti-Party and anti-socialist plot was completely crushed and some people were removed from their posts, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." This play says that the "honest officials" who carried out "land restitution" sympathized with the peasants and worked for them, but they were dismissed from their posts; how "unjust" this is! He placed great sympathy in that Hai Rui who was dismissed from office.
    Comrade Wu Han said: writing plays and writing about dead people is "using the past to serve the present" and "serving the living." This is the truth. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is "serving the living," allowing the dead Hai Rui to serve the living right opportunist elements. The Hai Rui on stage is the right opportunist elements off stage. Comrade Wu Han's praise of Hai Rui is praise of right opportunism. Most viciously, Comrade Wu Han repeatedly emphasized that Hai Rui "did not succumb, did not lose heart" after being "dismissed from office," that the people "supported him and praised him," and that one day he would "return to office and reorganize the discipline." The implication is to tell the audience: the dismissal of the right opportunist elements was unjust and unreasonable; at the same time, it tells the right opportunist elements not to be discouraged; the people "support" them. He wants the right opportunist elements to learn from Hai Rui, to learn Hai Rui's spirit of "trying again after failure," and to continue to oppose the Party.
    I only knew before that Comrade Wu Han was a "famous figure," an "authority figure." It turns out that he is a bourgeois "authority," an "authority" who is anti-Party, anti-people, and anti-socialist, and who waves the flag and shouts for the right opportunists.
    Poisonous weeds must be uprooted, and when they are uprooted, they must be uprooted from the roots. Anything that is an enemy of the people, we must fight it. Some people defend Wu Han, saying that if you criticize Wu Han in this way, no one will dare to write historical dramas anymore. They want to scare us with this. This is useless. We don't cherish historical dramas like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office." Reactionary things and things intended to be unkind will only poison us. Not writing them won't scare us. And after this critical struggle, everyone's understanding will be raised, and in the future, many newly written revolutionary historical dramas that are loved by the people will surely appear.

    吴晗是反党反社会主义的“权威”
    陕西省兴平县西吴公社北马大队党支部书记　韩志刚
    吴晗同志写的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》，是地地道道的大毒草。它们的矛头对准了党和社会主义。这些作品是跟党中央和毛泽东思想对立的。把这些毒草和庐山会议前后的形势一联系，它们就原形毕露。
    一九五九年右倾机会主义分子说什么“人民公社搞糟了”、“大跃进失败了”，大骂党和社会主义的时候，吴晗同志写了《海瑞骂皇帝》。在这篇文章里，吴晗一点也不进行阶级分析，而且砍去了海瑞哭皇帝的史实，把海瑞描写为一个得到人民支持的“反对派”，大加歌颂。这篇文章在当时发表，它的社会作用只能是给右倾机会主义分子撑腰，妄想骂倒三面红旗。
    当右倾机会主义分子反党反社会主义的阴谋被彻底粉碎，一些人被撤了职的时候，吴晗同志又写了《海瑞罢官》。这出戏说：搞“退田”的“清官”是同情农民和为农民办事的，可是他们却被罢了官，这是多么的“理不公”啊！他对那被罢了官的海瑞寄予了万分的同情。
    吴晗同志说：写戏、写死人是“古为今用”，“为活人服务”。这是老实话。《海瑞罢官》是“为活人服务”，是叫死了的海瑞为活着的右倾机会主义分子服务。戏上的海瑞就是台下的右倾机会主义分子。吴晗同志歌颂海瑞就是歌颂右倾机会主义。最毒辣的是，吴晗同志一再强调海瑞“罢官”以后仍“不屈服、不丧气”，人民“拥护他，歌颂他”，有朝一日他还会“再居官重整纪纲”。言中之意是告诉观众：右倾机会主义分子被撤职是不公正的不合理的；同时也告诉右倾机会主义分子不要灰心丧气；人民是“拥护”他们的。他要右倾机会主义分子向海瑞学习，学习海瑞的“失败了再干”的精神，继续与党对立。
    从前只知道吴晗同志是个“名家”，是“权威人士”，原来是资产阶级的“权威”，是反党、反人民、反社会主义的、给右倾机会主义者摇旗呐喊的“权威”。
    毒草不拔不行，要拔就要连根拔。凡是与人民为敌的东西，我们就要和它作斗争。有一些人给吴晗辩护，说什么你们这样批判吴晗，以后没有人再敢写历史剧了。他们想以此来吓我们。这是没有用的。象《海瑞罢官》这类历史剧我们不稀罕。反动的东西、存心不善的东西要了只会中毒。不写，吓唬不倒我们。而经过这场批判斗争，大家提高了认识，将来一定会出现许多为人民所喜爱的新编的革命历史剧。
