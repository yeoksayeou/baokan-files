    Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, March 31st. The teachers and students of Guangxi Zhuang Language School recently gathered and carried out various commemorative activities to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the school's founding. This school is located in Wuming County, Guangxi. Over the past ten years, more than nine thousand six hundred and sixty students of various ethnic groups have graduated.

    This school is responsible for training Zhuang language teachers for Zhuang language schools run by various special districts and counties in the autonomous region. At the same time, it is responsible for training Zhuang people sent from neighboring provinces such as Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangdong, as well as other ethnic minority students and ethnic minority cadres whose language is basically the same as Zhuang. According to the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, this school also helps rural people's communes in Zhuang areas to run cultural centers well, conduct pilot projects for Zhuang language popularization, translate Chairman Mao's works such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" into Zhuang in the pilot communes, and compile folk song performance materials as teaching materials for commune members' cultural night schools, which are very popular among the masses.

    The Zhuang people historically had no written language. After liberation, with the care of the Party and the People's Government, the Zhuang language was created. In order to train Zhuang language cadres, in addition to a Zhuang language school run by the autonomous region, there are also two special district-run and more than thirty county-run Zhuang language schools in Guangxi.

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th. A new Communist Labor University established in Wuhan recently opened.

    This new type of half-farming, half-study school has four departments: agriculture and forestry, agricultural machinery, agronomy, and agricultural economics. The school system is four or five years, enrolling students equivalent to high school or junior high school graduates. Junior high school graduates will study a two-year preparatory course before studying undergraduate courses. During their studies, students study and labor at the same time. After graduation, they can become cadres, technicians, workers, and farmers.

    新华社南宁三十一日电　广西壮文学校师生最近集会并开展各种纪念活动，庆祝建校十周年。这所学校设在广西武鸣县。十年来，已有九千六百六十多名各族学生毕业。
    这所学校担负着为自治区各专区和县办的壮文学校培养壮文教师的任务，同时，负责培养贵州、云南和广东等邻省送来的壮族的、以及语言与壮族基本相同的其他少数民族学员和民族干部。这所学校根据党的教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，还帮助壮族人民聚居地区农村人民公社办好文化室，进行壮文普及试点工作，在试点的公社用壮文翻译毛主席著作《愚公移山》和《纪念白求恩》等文章，编写山歌演唱材料，作为社员文化夜校的教材，很受群众欢迎。
    壮族历史上没有文字。解放后，在党和人民政府的关怀下，创造了壮文。为培养壮文干部，现在广西除有一所自治区举办的壮文学校以外，还有两所专区办的和三十多所县办的壮文学校。
    据新华社武汉二十六日电　武汉市新办的一所共产主义劳动大学最近开学。
