    Xinhua News Agency, April 19th: Farah, Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Arab Syrian Republic in China, held a reception at the Beijing Hotel tonight to celebrate Syria's National Day.
    Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Premier Bo Yibo, Vice Chairman Lin Feng of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Vice Chairman Shen Yanbing of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Vice Chairman Fu Zuoyi of the National Defense Council, President Yang Xiufeng of the Supreme People's Court, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, and others attended the reception upon invitation.
    Chargé d'Affaires Farah and Vice Premier Bo Yibo spoke at the reception, jointly wishing for the continuous consolidation and development of friendly cooperative relations between China and Syria. In his speech, Vice Premier Bo Yibo reiterated that the Chinese government and people firmly support the just struggle of the Arab peoples to win and safeguard national independence and oppose imperialism, headed by the United States, and its tool of aggression, Israel.
    In his speech, Chargé d'Affaires Farah condemned colonialism for shooting arrows from behind the backs of the Arab peoples, planting a colonial bacillus, a base serving colonial goals and interests, in the Middle East, namely Israel. He said that the Zionist bandit gang entrenched in the land of Palestine is a threat to the fighting Asian and African peoples and the liberation movement of the world. He said that colonialism throughout the world is a unified entity. The colonialism that cruelly massacres the Vietnamese people is precisely the colonialism that drove the Palestinian people out of their homes and lands, and it is also the colonialism that is providing weapons and ammunition to the Zionist state occupying Palestine.
    The Chargé d'Affaires introduced the achievements Syria has made in various fields over the past twenty years since its liberation and praised the friendly relations between Syria and China. He said that many factors link Syria and friendly China, such as opposition to colonialism and international imperialism, support for peoples struggling for freedom and independence, the necessity to grant freedom and independence to the heroic Vietnamese people, and the necessity to allow the exiled Palestinian people to return to their occupied lands and homes.
    In his speech, Vice Premier Bo Yibo praised the Syrian people for having waged repeated struggles against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and for actively supporting the struggle of the Arab and Asian-African peoples in unity against imperialism. He condemned U.S. imperialism for vigorously supporting Israel, depriving the Palestinian Arab people of their legitimate rights, antagonizing the Arab peoples, and seriously threatening the security of the Arab countries.
    Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that the Syrian government and people's solemn condemnation of the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism, and their sympathy and support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, is entirely just. This is also a common position that all Asian-African countries and peoples who uphold the cause of unity against imperialism should adhere to. The Chinese people are willing to join hands with the Syrian people and other Asian-African peoples, together with the people of the world, to resolutely support the great struggle of the Vietnamese people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, until final victory is achieved.
    In conclusion, Vice Premier Bo Yibo said that the friendship between the Chinese people and the Syrian people, and all the Arab people, will be increasingly enhanced in the common struggle against imperialism.
    Also present at the reception upon invitation were responsible persons from other departments of the government, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, people's organizations, and the Beijing Municipality. Diplomatic envoys from various countries to China also attended the reception.

    法拉赫临时代办薄一波副总理讲话共祝两国人民的友好合作关系不断发展
    新华社十九日讯　阿拉伯叙利亚共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办法拉赫，今晚在北京饭店举行招待会，庆祝叙利亚国庆节。
    董必武副主席，薄一波副总理，林枫副委员长，政协全国委员会副主席沈雁冰，国防委员会副主席傅作义，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰，外交部副部长姬鹏飞等，应邀出席了招待会。
    法拉赫临时代办和薄一波副总理在招待会上讲了话，共祝中叙两国人民的友好合作关系不断巩固和发展。薄一波副总理在讲话中重申，中国政府和人民坚决支持阿拉伯各国人民争取和维护民族独立，反对以美国为首的帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列的正义斗争。
    法拉赫临时代办在讲话中，谴责殖民主义在阿拉伯人民背后施放暗箭，把一个殖民主义的毒菌、为殖民主义的目标和利益服务的基地以色列安插在中东。他说，盘踞在巴勒斯坦国土上的犹太复国主义匪帮，是对战斗的亚非各国人民和全世界解放运动的威胁。他说，全世界的殖民主义是一个整体，残酷地屠杀着越南人民的殖民主义，正是把巴勒斯坦人民赶出他们家园的殖民主义，也正是它在向占领巴勒斯坦的犹太复国主义国家提供武器和军火。
    临时代办介绍了叙利亚获得解放二十年来，在各方面获得的成就，并且称赞了叙中两国的友好关系。他说，有许多因素把叙利亚和友好的中国联系在一起，如反对殖民主义和国际帝国主义，支持争取自由和独立而斗争着的人民，以及必须给英雄的越南人民以自由和独立，必须让流亡的巴勒斯坦人民返回他们被占领的土地和家园。
    薄一波副总理在讲话中赞扬叙利亚人民曾经同帝国主义和新老殖民主义进行了反复的斗争，叙利亚人民积极支持阿拉伯和亚非各国人民团结反帝的斗争。他谴责美帝国主义正在大力扶植以色列，剥夺巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民的合法权利，同阿拉伯各国人民为敌，严重威胁阿拉伯国家的安全。
    薄一波副总理说，叙利亚政府和人民严正谴责美帝国主义的野蛮侵略，同情和支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，是完全正义的。这也是一切维护团结反帝事业的亚非国家和人民应该坚持的共同立场。中国人民愿意同叙利亚和亚非其他各国人民一道，同全世界人民一道，坚决支援越南人民抗美救国的伟大斗争，一直到取得最后胜利。
    薄一波副总理最后说，中国人民同叙利亚人民和全体阿拉伯人民的友谊，在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，必将日益增进。
    应邀出席招待会的，还有政府其他部门、中国人民解放军、人民团体和北京市的负责人。各国驻中国的使节也出席了招待会。
