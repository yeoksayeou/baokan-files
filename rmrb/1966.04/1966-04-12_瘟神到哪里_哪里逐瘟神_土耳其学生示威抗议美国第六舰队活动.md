    Where the Plague God Arrives, There He Is Driven Away
    Turkish Students Demonstrate Against Activities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet
    Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, Ankara dispatch: Students in Istanbul, a port city in northwestern Turkey, protested on April 8th against the activities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet there.
    Students floated a large buoy in the sea where the U.S. Sixth Fleet warships were docked, with the words: "All the oppressed will eventually crush the oppressors." Western news agencies reported that the students' protests showed that "anti-American sentiment is growing in Turkish intellectual circles."
    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th, Istanbul dispatch: Students in Ankara, the capital of Turkey, and Istanbul, the largest city, demonstrated on April 9th, shouting slogans such as "Yankee Go Home!" and "Sixth Fleet Go Home!" to protest the activities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in Turkey.
    In the port city of Istanbul, approximately five hundred students participated in the demonstration.
    They angrily intercepted cars carrying U.S. soldiers from the Sixth Fleet on the streets, demanding that the American soldiers get out of Turkey. The students also threw stones at an American library in the center of this large city. The U.S. Sixth Fleet hastily cancelled all shore leave permits for soldiers that day.

    土耳其学生示威抗议美国第六舰队活动
    新华社九日讯　安卡拉消息：土耳其西北部港口城市伊斯坦布尔的学生们八日抗议美国第六舰队到那里活动。
    学生们在美国第六舰队军舰停泊的海面上飘放了一个大浮圈，上面写着：“所有被压迫者终将粉碎压迫者”。西方通讯社的报道说，学生们的抗议表明，“反美情绪正在土耳其知识界增长”。
    新华社十日讯　伊斯坦布尔消息：土耳其首都安卡拉和最大城市伊斯坦布尔学生九日举行示威，高呼“美国佬滚回去！”“第六舰队滚回去！”口号，抗议美国第六舰队到土耳其进行活动。
    在港口城市伊斯坦布尔，有大约五百名学生参加了示威。
    他们在大街上愤怒地截拦了第六舰队美国兵的汽车，要美国兵从土耳其滚出去。学生们还向在这个大城市中心的一座美国图书馆扔石头。美国第六舰队当天急忙一律取消了所有士兵登陆的许可。
