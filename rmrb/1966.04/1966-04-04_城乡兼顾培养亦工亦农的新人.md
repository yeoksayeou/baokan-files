    Cultivating New People Who Integrate City and Countryside, Combining Industry and Agriculture
    Changchun City Education Bureau Working Group
    Changchun No. 2 Work-Study Middle School was founded in the summer of 1964. The school is located in the suburbs. It enrolls urban primary school graduates and has a four-year program. Currently, there are eleven classes with 542 students. The school's main academic courses are the same as those of a full-time junior high school, with only the addition of an agriculture course. The school has its own carpentry workshop and electrical installation team, as well as a farm. Some students study carpentry, and some study electrical work, both of which are applicable in both urban and rural areas. All students participate in agricultural labor.

    To run a school that is oriented towards the countryside and integrates city and countryside, enabling students to consciously and voluntarily participate in socialist construction in the countryside after graduation, requires a lot of work. In this regard, the school has mainly focused on the following tasks:

    Learn Two Kinds of Knowledge
    Learn both academic subjects and basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production. The school offers the main academic courses of junior high school. To enable students to participate in industrial and agricultural production labor after graduation, it also organizes students to learn relevant basic knowledge of industrial and agricultural production through practical production labor. Textbooks on basic carpentry and electrical knowledge are compiled by teachers and workers themselves, based on the characteristics of urban and rural use and in light of the students' actual situation, and are taught on the labor site. Students work in the workshop, learning while doing, learning what they do, and the students learn quickly and remember firmly. They not only know how to do it, but also understand the principles. Agricultural knowledge teaching, in addition to offering basic agricultural knowledge courses, also combines agricultural labor, according to the agricultural season, and teachers or old farmers adopt the method of doing, talking, talking and doing, so that students gradually master the basic knowledge of agricultural production.

    Learn Two Kinds of Labor Skills
    The industrial production technology that students learn can be used in both urban and rural areas, allowing them to work in factories and farms. Over the past year, through the joint efforts of teachers and students, a carpentry workshop has been set up to produce wooden furniture, wire troughs, wooden platforms, paint brushing, etc., and an electrical installation team has been established. These two production projects have been incorporated into the local industrial production plan and are applicable in both urban and rural areas. The labor skills that students learn can be used in cities and in the countryside. They have also established an agricultural production labor base, with a farm of seventy acres of land, which is expected to increase to one hundred and fifty acres this year. These production labor bases can accommodate all teachers and students to participate in production labor. Students spend seven months learning and four months working, taking turns participating in industrial and agricultural production labor, with six hours of labor per day. When organizing and arranging students to participate in industrial labor, they are allowed to participate in both mechanical and manual operations to master basic skills and adapt to the needs of urban and rural areas. Through industrial and agricultural production labor, students can learn both industrial production skills and agricultural production skills. Now, second-year students who study electrical work have mastered skills such as installing electric lights, fluorescent lights, connecting wires, and installing switches. Students who study carpentry have initially mastered the basic skills of carpentry such as chiseling, planing, axing, and sawing, and most students have mastered techniques such as planing surfaces, chiseling holes, installing, splicing boards, and sawing off. When they went to the countryside to serve last year, they could also make pot lids, bowl racks, panels, kang tables, benches, augers, and repair bellows and doors and windows. In terms of agricultural production, they have learned general farm work.

    Tell Students During Enrollment That They Should Be Prepared to Be Farmers and Workers
    In addition to contacting worker masters while working in the factory, the school also regularly organizes student service teams to go to the countryside to serve poor and lower-middle peasants. In the second half of last year, they successively organized mixed carpentry and electrical service teams to go to seven production teams in the countryside to help commune members repair doors and windows, tables and chairs, bowl cabinets, pot lids, panels, etc., and make augers and repair farm tools for the production teams. Students in the electrical engineering class connected wires, installed lamp holders, and repaired electrical switches for production teams and commune members, which was deeply welcomed by the poor and lower-middle peasants.

    The school has also established fixed contacts with three nearby farms and nine production teams. During the busy agricultural season, students are organized to participate in labor in the production teams. Last year, they supported a total of more than 8,130 workdays, which not only solved the shortage of labor during the busy farming season, but also allowed students to labor together with poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving the influence of the excellent qualities of the working people and cultivating their ideological feelings of loving agriculture and loving poor and lower-middle peasants.

    Repeatedly and Continuously Strengthen Ideological Education on Taking Pride in Agriculture, Enjoying Agriculture, and Aspiring to Farm. At the beginning of the school, students were told that they should be ideologically prepared to be farmers and workers. The school's political class takes the education of loving agricultural labor as an important content. When organizing rural service teams to go to the countryside, old poor peasants with deep-seated grievances were invited to talk about their family histories. During agricultural labor, attention is paid to carrying out education on loving agricultural labor.

    Run Schools Diligently and Frugally, Build Schools Through Labor
    This school encountered many difficulties and struggles in the process of its establishment.

    In the early days of the school, there were only twenty-five dilapidated warehouses, garages, and dormitories that had been in disrepair for many years. The courtyard was knee-deep in weeds, and there were broken bricks and tiles everywhere. There were no classrooms, no dining halls, students ate in the open air, and teachers worked in the dormitory. Some teachers quit when they saw this situation. Many students were also not at ease with their studies. In order to run this school well, the school leaders took the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works with the masses from the very beginning, criticizing bourgeois ideology, and overcoming the difficulties in the course of progress.

    The school followed Chairman Mao's teaching of running all undertakings diligently and frugally, and mobilized teachers and students to build the school through labor with a revolutionary spirit. Over the past year, teachers and students have leveled 5,000 square meters of the schoolyard, transported more than 400 cubic meters of garbage, built more than 300 meters of roads, planted more than 7,000 trees, renovated 25 old houses, and teachers and students built a 400-square-meter dining hall by themselves. In the process of establishing the production base, adhering to the spirit of spending less money and doing more things, if the factory building is not enough, build it yourself, if the tools are not enough, make it yourself. Forty-three of the fifty-five main parts of the eight woodworking machine tools were manufactured by themselves and purchased from old goods stores for very little money. After more than a month of hard work, they installed eight woodworking machine tools and built a semi-mechanized carpentry workshop and an electrical installation team. Last year, they produced 92,000 meters of wire troughs, 43,000 wooden platforms, 2,100 sets of student desks and chairs, and contracted for the electrical installation projects of twelve units. At the same time, they also started a farm, which produced more than 10,000 kilograms of grain and more than 150,000 kilograms of melons and vegetables last year. Students participating in industrial and agricultural labor created more than 100,000 yuan of wealth. Now, students do not have to spend money to go to school, and food expenses have been reduced and exempted. Last year, each second-year student was also given a set of uniforms and a pair of rubber shoes.

    Teachers and Students Labor and Live Together
    Vigorously grasp teachers' teaching while working to promote teachers' revolutionization and laborization. Teachers have improved their awareness by studying Chairman Mao's works, and realize that to cultivate revolutionary successors, there must be revolutionary teachers. Many teachers can consciously transform their thinking, set an example, and teach by example. Teachers have always insisted on participating in production labor with students. They are teachers in class and safety officers and "class leaders" in labor. Sometimes they also replace odd-job workers, boiling water, ringing bells, chopping grass, and keeping watch. Through production labor, they not only learned some industrial and agricultural production skills, but also enriched the teaching content and transformed their thinking. At present, among teachers, there is a comparison of progress in thinking, a comparison of vigor in work, a comparison of hardship in life, and a competition for heavy burdens in labor, and good people and good deeds continue to emerge.

    Teachers have established the idea of ​​serving students, and further strengthened the relationship between teachers and students. Teachers and students have established a close relationship in common labor and life. Teachers and students regularly live in the same dormitory, taking care of students, covering students with quilts at night, and sewing and mending clothes and haircuts for students. Teachers care about students, and students also love and respect teachers more. One day during a nap, the weather was a bit cool. Teacher Xu Rongzhen was worried that the students would catch a cold, so she took the initiative to cover the student by the window with one of her blankets. Once, she woke up from her nap and found three blankets covering her.

    Establish a Good Leadership Core
    Establish a united and hard-working leading group. The leading cadres of this school pay attention to their own ideological transformation. They earnestly read Chairman Mao's books, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, unite as one, and lead the masses to work hard. They have established a good leadership core, respecting and supporting each other. Major issues are discussed collectively, and specific tasks are assigned and responsible. These leading cadres can set an example and rely on the masses to overcome difficulties. At the beginning of the school's establishment, there were many tasks and many difficulties. The school's leading cadres studied "On Contradiction" with this problem in mind. According to Chairman Mao's instructions on grasping the main contradictions and concentrating superior forces to fight annihilating battles, they organized the masses to fight three battles successively: ideological battles, school-building battles, and factory-building battles, which fully mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses, and the appearance of the school gradually changed. These cadres can also adhere to eating, living, and working with teachers and students. The school also pays special attention to strengthening Party building and selecting and training new forces.

    城乡兼顾培养亦工亦农的新人
    长春市教育局工作组
    长春市第二工读中学是一九六四年暑期创办的。校址设在近郊。招收城市高小毕业生，学制四年。现有十一个班，学生五百四十二人。学校的主要文化课和全日制初中一样，只增加了农业课。学校自己办了木工厂和电气承装队，并有一处农场。一部分学生学木工，一部分学生学电工，这些工种都是城乡通用的。所有的学生都要参加农业劳动。
    办好面向农村，城乡兼顾的学校，使学生毕业以后自觉自愿地到农村参加社会主义建设，是需要做很多工作的。在这方面，学校主要抓了以下几项工作：
    学好两种知识
    既学好文化课，又学工农业生产基础知识。学校开设了初中的主要文化课。为了使学生毕业后有参加工农业生产劳动的能力，还通过生产劳动实践，组织学生学习有关工农业生产基础知识。木工、电工基础知识教材，是根据城乡通用的特点，结合学生的实际，由教师和工人自己编写的，在劳动现场讲授。学生在车间劳动，边做边学，做什么，学什么，学生学的快，记的扎实，不仅会做，而且也懂得道理。农业知识教学，除开设农业基础知识课外，还结合农业劳动，根据农事季节，在农场由教师或老农采取做什么，讲什么，边讲边做的办法，使学生逐步掌握农业生产基础知识。
    学会两种劳动本领
    学生学习的工业生产技术，能够城乡通用，能做工，也能务农。一年多来，经过师生共同努力，办起了一个制作木家具、电线槽、木台、刷油等车间的木工厂，有一个电气承装队。这两个生产项目都纳入了地方工业生产计划，并且都是城乡通用的。学生学到的劳动技能，在城市里用得上，在农村也用得上。他们还建立了农业生产劳动基地，有一个七十多亩土地的农场，今年预计增加到一百五十亩。这些生产劳动基地，可以容纳全校师生参加生产劳动。学生一年内七个月学习，四个月劳动，轮流参加工农业生产劳动，每天劳动时间六小时。在组织安排学生参加工业劳动时，既让学生参加机械操作，也让学生参加手工操作，掌握基本功，适应城市和农村的需要。通过工农业生产劳动，学生既能学到工业生产技能，又能学到农业生产技能。现在，二年级学生，学电工的已掌握了安电灯、日光灯，接电线、安开关等技能。学木工的初步掌握了凿、刨、斧、锯等木工的基本功，大部分学生已会刨面、凿眼、安装、拼板、锯断等技术。去年他们到农村服务时，还能做锅盖、碗架子、面板、炕桌、板凳、绞锥，修理风匣和门窗。在农业生产方面，学会了一般的农活。
    招生时就向学生讲清要当农民、工人
    学生除在工厂劳动接触工人师傅外，学校还定期组织学生服务队，到农村去为贫下中农服务。去年下半年，他们先后组织木工、电工混合服务队，到农村七个生产队，帮助社员修理门窗、桌椅、碗柜、锅盖、面板等，并给生产队做绞锥和修理农具。电工班的学生，给生产队和社员接电线、安灯头、修电闸，深受贫下中农的欢迎。
    学校还和附近三个农场、九个生产队建立了固定的联系。农业大忙季节，组织学生到生产队参加劳动。去年，他们一共支援了八千一百三十多个劳动日，不仅解决了农忙季节劳力不足，而且学生和贫下中农在一起劳动，受到了劳动人民优秀品质的熏陶，培养了他们热爱农业、热爱贫下中农的思想感情。
    反复不断地加强以农为荣，以农为乐，立志务农的思想教育。学校一开办，就向学生讲清，要有当农民、当工人的思想准备。学校的政治课，把热爱农业劳动的教育，做为一项重要内容。组织农村服务队下乡时，请苦大仇深的老贫农讲家史。在农业劳动当中，注意进行热爱农业劳动的教育。
    勤俭办学　劳动建校
    这所学校在创办过程中，曾经遇到很多困难和斗争。
    建校初期，只有二十五间年久失修的破仓库、破车库和破宿舍，院内蒿草没膝，遍地碎砖断瓦，没有教室，没有食堂，学生在露天吃饭，教师在宿舍里办公。有的教师看到这种情况就不干了。很多学生也不安心学习。为了办好这所学校，学校领导一开始就带头和群众一起学习毛主席著作，批判资产阶级思想，战胜前进当中的困难。
    学校遵照毛主席勤俭办一切事业的教导，发动师生以革命的精神，劳动建校。一年多来，师生平整了五千平方米的校院，运走了四百多方的垃圾，修筑了三百多米长的道路，植树七千多棵，改修了二十五间旧房，师生自建了四百平方米食堂。在建立生产基地的过程中，本着少花钱，多办事的精神，厂房不够，自己动手盖，工具不足，自己动手做。八台木机床五十五个主要部件中有四十三个部件是他们自己制造和从旧物商店用很少的钱买来的。经过一个多月的艰苦奋战，他们安装了八台木机床，建成了一个半机械化的木工厂和一个电气承装队。去年生产了九万二千米电线槽，四万三千个木台，两千一百套学生桌椅，包修了十二个单位的电气安装工程。同时，还办起了一处农场，去年生产了一万多斤粮食，十五万多斤瓜菜。学生参加工农业劳动，共创造了十万多元财富。现在已经做到学生上学不花钱，减免了伙食费。去年还给二年级学生每人做了一套制服，买了一双胶鞋。
    教师与学生同劳动共生活
    狠抓教师边工边教，促进教师革命化、劳动化。教师通过学习毛主席著作，提高了觉悟，认识到培养革命后代，必须有革命化的教师。不少教师能自觉地改造思想，以身作则，身教言教。教师一直坚持和学生一起参加生产劳动。他们上课是教师，劳动是安全员、“大班长”。有时还顶替勤杂工，烧水、打铃、铡草、打更。通过生产劳动，不仅学到了一些工农业生产技能，而且也丰富了教学内容，改造了思想。目前在教师中，思想比进步，工作比干劲，生活比艰苦，劳动抢重担子挑，好人好事不断出现。
    教师树立了为学生服务的思想，进一步密切了师生关系。师生在共同劳动和生活中，建立了亲密的感情。教师和学生定期住在一个寝室，照顾学生，夜里给学生盖被子，还给学生缝补衣服，给学生理发。教师关心学生，学生也更爱戴教师。一天睡午觉，天气有些凉，徐荣珍老师担心学生感冒，主动把自己的一条毯子给靠窗户的学生盖上。有一次，她午睡醒来，发现学生在她身上盖了三条毯子。
    建立一个好的领导核心
    建立一个团结一致、艰苦创业的领导班子。这个学校的领导干部，注意本身的思想改造。他们认真读毛主席的书，按毛主席的指示办事，团结一致，带领群众，艰苦创业。他们建立了一个好的领导核心，互相尊重，互相支持。重大问题集体讨论，具体工作分工负责。这些领导干部，能以身作则，依靠群众克服困难。学校创办之初，工作千头万绪，困难很多。学校领导干部带着这个问题，学习了《矛盾论》，他们根据毛主席关于抓住主要矛盾和集中优势兵力打歼灭战的指示，组织群众先后打了三仗：思想仗、建校仗、建厂仗，充分调动了广大群众的积极性，学校的面貌逐步改观。这些干部，还能坚持和师生同吃、同住、同劳动。学校还特别注意加强党的建设，选拔培养新生力量。
