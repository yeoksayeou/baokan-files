    What is the Fundamental Reason for the Enemy's Uprising?
    Guo Chang, Political Officer of a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    The film "The Besieged City" does not demonstrate the power of our people's war in depicting the uprising of the enemy army, negates the decisive role of armed struggle, and distorts the principles of our army's political work to disintegrate the enemy forces. The film attributes the main factors of the 369th Division's uprising to internal contradictions of the enemy army: Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops eat well, while the 369th Division doesn't eat well; the direct line troops are well-equipped, while the 369th Division is not well-equipped. This fundamentally violates Chairman Mao's theory of class struggle; violates Chairman Mao's fundamental principle that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"; and violates Chairman Mao's military thought.
    The factors contributing to the enemy's uprising are diverse, and internal contradictions of the enemy can be one of the factors, but definitely not the main reason. The fundamental reason for the enemy army's uprising is mainly due to the pressure of the situation: not surrendering means certain death.

    The film is set in 1947. What kind of year was 1947? It was the year that the People's Liberation War entered a great turning point. At that time, we had changed from interior line operations to exterior line operations; from strategic defense to strategic offense, it was a favorable and excellent situation of full-scale offensive. In the Northeast, the enemy was weak and we were strong. The initiative of the war was entirely in our hands, we could fight how we wanted, attack how we wanted, and annihilate the enemy how we wanted. The situation on the enemy's side was the opposite. In the Chiang-controlled areas, the democratic tide of the people's masses against hunger and civil war was rising higher and higher; Chiang Kai-shek's regular army had 97 and a half brigades annihilated by us, 780,000 people, while puppet troops, security teams and other miscellaneous troops saw 340,000 people annihilated. Our victory caused extremely deep-seated feelings of defeat within the enemy, and there was no escape. Therefore, Chairman Mao said: "This is the turning point from the development to the destruction of Chiang Kai-shek's twenty years of counter-revolutionary rule. This is the turning point from the development to the destruction of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years. This is a great event." The enemy's uprising was inseparable from the situation at that time, and only uprising was the only way out. The film does not show this great turning point, but focuses on internal contradictions of the enemy in one shot after another. This is a serious distortion of history.

    The reason why the 369th Division revolted was the result of a large army pressing down on the border and the city being besieged. It was definitely not, as the film says, because the enemy army had some understanding of the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary nature of the war. Zheng Hanchen finally pointed a pistol at Staff Officer Hu and said: "Oppose your civil war..." This is completely untrue. The enemy is, after all, the enemy. The enemy will never surrender unless they are at a dead end; they will not lay down their weapons unless their necks are held tight. This is determined by the enemy's nature. As Chairman Mao said: "All reactionary things, if you don't hit them, they won't fall."

    At that time, there were only two paths in front of the enemy - death or life. The so-called life was to surrender to the people, perform meritorious service to atone for their crimes, and take the bright road of uprising; death was to resist to the end, cut themselves off from the people, and be annihilated by us in the end.

    The People's Liberation War is a just war, a people's war, and the hearts of the people are with us. However, the screenwriters fundamentally distorted this point. The isolated city in the film is like a stagnant pool, the masses have no strong desire for liberation and no enthusiastic support for the just actions of the People's Liberation War, and the underground workers of our party have not done any political mobilization work among the masses. From the perspective of the vast lower-level officers and soldiers of the enemy army, they were originally the mass base for the uprising, but the commanders and underground workers of our army in the film placed all their hopes on the senior Kuomintang officers and did not pay any attention to them at all, without carrying out any political work to win them over. From the film, one cannot see the driving force of the vast lower-level officers and soldiers for the uprising at all.

    In general, the enemy's uprising is the result of our army's military strikes; the result of military struggle and political struggle; and the result of the pressure of the situation. Attributing the main reason for the enemy's uprising to the internal contradictions of the enemy army obscures the class nature of the enemy.

    敌军起义的根本原因是什么？
    中国人民解放军某部政治干事　郭锠
    《兵临城下》在描写敌军起义过程中，没有表现出我人民战争的威力，否定了武装斗争的决定作用，歪曲了我军瓦解敌军的政治工作原则。影片把三六九师起义的主要因素，归结于敌军内部矛盾：蒋介石嫡系部队吃得好，三六九师吃得不好；嫡系部队装备好，三六九师装备不好。从根本上违背了毛主席关于阶级斗争的学说：违背了毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的基本原理；违背了毛主席的军事思想。
    敌人起义因素是多种多样的，敌人内部矛盾可以成为起义的因素之一，但决不是主要原因。敌军所以起义，归根到底，主要是由于形势所逼，不投降只有死路一条。
    影片的背景是一九四七年。一九四七年是怎样的一年呢？是人民解放战争进入伟大转折点的一年。那时，我们已由内线作战转为外线作战；由战略防御转入战略进攻，是一片进攻的有利的大好形势。在东北更是敌弱我强。战争的主动权完全操在我们手里，要怎么打就怎么打，要怎么攻就怎么攻，要怎么歼灭敌人就怎么歼灭。敌人方面情况相反。在蒋管区内，人民群众反饥饿、反内战的民主浪潮一浪高一浪；蒋介石的正规军被我歼灭了九十七个半旅，七十八万人，伪军、保安队等杂牌被歼三十四万人。我们的胜利引起敌人内部极端深刻的失败情绪，想逃也逃不了。所以毛主席说：“这是蒋介石的二十年反革命统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一个伟大的事变。”敌人所以起义，与当时的形势分不开，只有起义，才是唯一的出路。影片就没有表现出这一伟大转折点的形势，而左一个镜头，右一个镜头所描写的是敌人内部矛盾。这是对历史严重的歪曲。
    三六九师所以起义，是大军压境、兵临城下的结果，决不象电影所说，由于敌军对国民党的反革命战争性质有所认识。郑汉臣最后竟然拿着手枪对着胡高参说：“反对你们内战……”这是完全不真实的。敌人毕竟是敌人，敌人不到绝路之时，决不投降；不掐住敌人脖子，他不会放下武器，这是由敌人的本质决定的。正如毛主席所说：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”
    当时，摆在敌人面前的只有两条路——一死，一活。所谓活，就是投降人民，立功赎罪，走起义的光明大道；死，就是顽抗到底，自绝于人民，最后被我们消灭。
    人民解放战争是正义的战争，人民的战争，人心是向着我们的。编导者却根本歪曲了这一点。影片中的孤城犹如一潭死水，群众没有迫切要求解放的强烈愿望和热烈支援人民解放战争的正义行动，我党地下工作人员也没有在群众中做任何政治动员工作。从敌军广大的下级官兵来说，本来他们是起义的群众基础，影片中的我军指挥员、地下工作人员却把全部的希望都寄托在国民党高级军官身上，根本不把他们放在眼里，没有进行任何政治争取工作。从影片里根本看不到广大下层官兵对于起义的推动力量。
    总的说，敌人起义是我军军事打击的结果；是军事斗争与政治斗争的结果；是形势所迫的结果。把敌军起义的主要原因归结为敌军内部矛盾，就掩盖了敌人的阶级本质。
