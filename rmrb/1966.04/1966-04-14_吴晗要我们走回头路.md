    Wu Han Wants Us to Go Backwards
    Worker Engineer, Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, Chen Fa
    On the eve of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, when the right-leaning opportunists attacked the Party, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." He took a person who had been dead for hundreds of years and praised him to scold our great Party, acting as the vanguard of the right-leaning opportunists. After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, the Party and the people crushed the attack of the right-leaning opportunists and dismissed the right-leaning opportunists from their posts. At this time, Comrade Wu Han racked his brains again and presented the Peking Opera "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to cry injustice for the right-leaning opportunists, saying that they were "persecuting good people." And he cheered them on, telling them not to yield, not to be discouraged, and to "try again after failure." Can't these things completely show that Comrade Wu Han is already sitting on the same bench as the right-leaning opportunists? Some comrades said: "Comrade Wu Han is singing a duet against the Party." "Speaking for the right-leaning opportunists." "Encouraging them to continue to oppose the Party and socialism, and to struggle for the restoration of capitalism." I think this is absolutely true.
    Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to let the right-leaning opportunists learn from Hai Rui, so that we can return to the old society and the road of being oppressed and exploited, and let the landlords and capitalists oppress and exploit us again, riding on our heads to shit and pee. We, the working class, will never agree! In the old society, we, the working class, suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. My father was tortured to death. During the Japanese imperialist rule, the Japanese devils also killed my elder brother and arrested my younger brother, falsely claiming that he was communicating with "bandits." They hung him up and beat him half to death. I sold all the things in my house to redeem him. Unexpectedly, this caused another disaster. The Japanese devils saw that I had bailed out my younger brother, so they tied me up and took me to the military police headquarters without asking any questions. My family asked someone to give gifts, and my workmates joined forces to vouch for me, and I was released. That dark old society, I will never forget. Comrade Wu Han secretly helped the right-leaning opportunists, vainly trying to make us go backwards. This is impossible!
    Comrade Wu Han wants to dismantle the socialist stage and take the capitalist road. We, the working class, firmly oppose it. After his conspiracy and tricks were exposed, he tried to deny it and tried to make people believe that his mistakes were academic issues, not political ones. Can this deceive our working class? He stands on the position of the feudal landlord class and the bourgeoisie, and is dissatisfied with the Party and socialism. Although he writes articles on academic matters, what he does is to use academics as a cover to oppose socialism. How can this be an academic issue? Comrade Mao Zedong told us that the influence of the bourgeoisie and intellectuals from the old society will continue to exist for a long time, and as a class ideology, it will continue to exist in our country for a long time. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, not forget class struggle, and not forget the struggle on the ideological front.

    吴晗要我们走回头路
    长辛店机车车辆工厂工人工程师　陈发
    党的八届八中全会的前夕，右倾机会主义分子向党进攻的时候，吴晗同志写了《海瑞骂皇帝》。他把死了几百年的人，抬出来骂我们伟大的党，充当右倾机会主义分子的急先锋。党的八届八中全会以后，党和人民粉碎了右倾机会主义的进攻，罢了右倾机会主义分子的官。这时，吴晗同志又费尽了脑子，端出《海瑞罢官》的京剧，替右倾机会主义分子喊冤，说什么“陷害忠良”。并且还给他们打气，叫他们别屈服，别丧气，“失败了再干”。这些事不是完全可以看出，吴晗同志已经和右倾机会主义分子坐在一条板凳上了吗？有的同志说：“吴晗同志同党唱对台戏。”“替右倾机会主义分子讲话。”“鼓动他们继续反党反社会主义，为复辟资本主义而奋斗。”我看，这话一点不假。
    吴晗同志写《海瑞罢官》是让右倾机会主义分子学习海瑞，使我们重新回到旧社会受压迫受剥削的道路上去，让地主和资本家重新压迫和剥削我们，骑在我们头上拉屎撒尿。我们工人阶级坚决不答应！在旧社会里，我们工人阶级受尽了剥削和压迫，我的爸爸就是被折磨死的。日本帝国主义统治时期，日本鬼子又祸害死了我的哥哥，还把我老兄弟抓了去，硬说他通“匪”，吊起来，打得死去活来，我卖光了家里的所有东西，才把他赎了回来。没想到，这又闯下了祸，日本鬼子见我保出老兄弟，便不问青红皂白，就把我捆起来，弄到宪兵队，家里托人送礼，伙友们联合了大部分人出面保我，才把我放出来。那黑暗的旧社会，我永世难忘。吴晗同志暗地里给右倾机会主义分子帮忙，妄想要我们走回头路，这办不到！
    吴晗同志要想拆社会主义的台，走资本主义道路，我们工人阶级坚决反对。当他的阴谋诡计被拆穿以后，他又力图抵赖，竭力使人相信，他有错误也是学术问题，而不是政治问题。这能欺骗得了我们工人阶级吗？他站在封建地主阶级、资产阶级的立场上，对党对社会主义心怀不满，虽然在学术上做文章，而干的却是以学术作掩护，反对社会主义。这怎么是学术问题呢？毛泽东同志告诉我们，资产阶级和从旧社会来的知识分子的影响还要长期存在，作为阶级的意识形态，还要在我国长期存在。我们要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，不要忘记阶级斗争，不要忘记思想战线上的斗争。
