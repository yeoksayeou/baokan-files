    North Korea Achieves Great Successes in Healthcare
    Orchard Area Increases by 60% Compared to Five Years Ago
    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 13th) A national conference of medical workers in Korea was held in Pyongyang on the 11th and 12th.
    The conference discussed the issue of "improving and strengthening healthcare work." Minister of Public Health, Choe Chang-sik, delivered a report on the issue at the meeting. More than 1,700 people participated in the conference.
    According to Choe Chang-sik's report, in the past ten years, the number of healthcare and treatment and prevention institutions in North Korea has increased by two and a half times, and the number of doctors in 1965 increased by 5.7 times compared to 1956. Currently, every *ri* (village) has established a clinic, and a complete healthcare system has been established from the central to local levels. As a result, the mortality rate per thousand people last year decreased by almost half compared to 1956.
    The conference decided to launch mass sanitation campaigns in all sectors to develop healthcare work to a higher stage.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang) According to recent reports in local newspapers, the total area of orchards in North Korea is currently 60% larger than it was five years ago. Last year's fruit production also increased by 60% compared to 1960.
    According to reports, before liberation, the mountainous regions of Ryanggang Province and Chagang Province in northern Korea had few orchards. Now, there are large orchards. Over the past five years, these two provinces have planted a total of more than 2,700 *chongbo* (one *chongbo* is approximately equal to 15 *mu*) of orchards. South Hamgyong Province and South Hwanghae Province, which are suitable for planting fruit trees, have also seen rapid increases in orchard area in recent years, each increasing by about 10,000 *chongbo*.
    In recent years, employees of institutions and enterprises, as well as farmers, have also achieved great success in planting fruit trees.

    朝鲜保健事业取得很大成就
    果树总面积比五年前增加百分之六十
    新华社平壤十三日电  朝鲜全国医务工作者会议十一日和十二日在平壤举行。
    这次会议讨论了“改进和加强保健工作”的问题。保健相崔昌锡在会上就这个问题作了报告。有一千七百多人参加了这次会议。
    根据崔昌锡的报告，最近十年来，朝鲜卫生保健和治疗预防机构增加了两倍半，一九六五年医生的人数比一九五六年增加了五点七倍。目前，每个里都设立了诊疗所，从中央到地方已建立起完整的保健工作体系。因此，去年每一千人中的死亡率比一九五六年几乎减少了一半。
    会议决定在一切部门中开展群众性的卫生运动，以便把卫生保健工作发展到更高的阶段。
    新华社平壤电　据这里报纸最近报道，朝鲜目前果树的总面积比五年前增加了百分之六十。去年的水果产量也比一九六○年增加了百分之六十。
    据报道，解放前，朝鲜北部山区两江道和慈江道果树稀少。现在已有了大片果园。五年来，这两个道共种植了二千七百多町步（一町步约等于十五市亩）果树。适宜于种植果树的咸镜南道和黄海南道近年来果树面积也在迅速增加，各增加了一万町步左右。
    近年来，机关企业的职工们和农民们在种植果树方面也取得了很大成绩。
