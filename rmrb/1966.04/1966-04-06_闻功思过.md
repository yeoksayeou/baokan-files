　　Hearing Praise, Reflecting on Faults
　　Chen Fengxiang, the Party Branch Secretary of the Qinghua Brigade, Xinli Commune, Bin County, Heilongjiang Province, once sought the opinion of Wang Zhi, the organization committee member. Wang Zhi said:
　　“You solve problems quickly. The brigade leader is hesitant in handling affairs. Commune members prefer to look for you rather than the brigade leader.” Was this praise or criticism? Chen Fengxiang thought carefully and felt that there was criticism within the praise. Why didn't commune members look for the brigade leader for assistance? He thought, this probably had something to do with the fact that he didn't pay much attention to methods when handling affairs, taking all the administrative matters upon himself, and not giving the brigade leader a chance to play his role.
　　Having found the shortcomings, he made a self-criticism at the branch committee meeting. The brigade leader also said: "In the past, I thought the secretary would take care of administrative matters, which I welcomed, as it saved me from taking responsibility. I didn't raise any objections or get involved, and I was also in the wrong!" The branch committee also offered criticism of Chen Fengxiang. From then on, Chen Fengxiang paid attention to grasping Party work, while administrative work was left to the brigade leader.
　　Chen Fengxiang's experience in handling this matter is very enlightening. Everything is divided into two. A person has both advantages and disadvantages. However, some people sometimes find it difficult to perceive their own shortcomings. Therefore, when we hear praise, we must not be complacent, but should examine what shortcomings we still have. Otherwise, we will become arrogant and complacent, and stagnate. A Communist Party member should not only rejoice upon hearing criticism, but also be able to reflect on faults upon hearing praise. Only in this way can we continuously develop our strengths, overcome our shortcomings, and continue to advance.

    闻功思过
    黑龙江省宾县新立公社庆华大队党支部书记陈凤祥，有一次征求组织委员王志的意见，王志说：
  “你解决问题快，大队长办事犹豫，社员有事愿找你，不愿找大队长。”这到底是表扬，还是批评呢？陈凤祥仔细一琢磨，感到表扬中也有批评。社员办事为什么不找大队长呢，他想，这大概同自己办事不大讲究方法，把行政事务都揽过来，没有发挥大队长的作用有关系。
    找到了缺点，他就在支委会上做了检查，大队长也说：“过去我认为行政事书记都管，我更欢迎，省得我负责任。有意见不提，也不管事，我也不对！”支委也对陈凤祥提了意见。从那以后，陈凤祥注意抓党的工作，行政工作则由大队长去做。
    陈凤祥处理这件事的经验，给人很大启发。一切事物都是一分为二，一个人有优点也有缺点。但是，有的人有时候不容易觉察自己的缺点。因此，我们听了表扬，不能沾沾自喜，而要查查自己还有那些缺点。不然就会骄傲自满，固步自封。一个共产党员，不仅要闻过则喜，而且要能闻功思过。这样才能不断发扬优点，克服缺点，不断前进。
