    Xinhua News Agency, April 18th. Persons in Beijing from the Thai Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee provided Xinhua News Agency with a press release issued by the Thai Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee on April 13th. The press release strongly condemned and protested the crimes of the Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel in arresting, detaining, suppressing, and killing Indonesian patriots and democrats. The full text of the press release is as follows:
    Instigated and supported by U.S. imperialism, the Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel, under the pretext of "suppressing the supporters of the September 30th Movement," have arbitrarily arrested and killed Indonesian patriots and democrats since October 1965. Even according to the report of the "Fact-Finding Committee" appointed by President Sukarno, investigations conducted between December 27, 1965, and January 6, 1966, revealed that 78,500 people were killed and 106,000 people were arrested in Bali, East Java, Central Java, and parts of North Sumatra alone (we believe these estimates are very conservative, and the real figures are much higher). The Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel have arbitrarily banned many progressive mass organizations, such as the People's Youth League, the Indonesian University Student Movement Alliance, the Indonesian University Student Association, the Indonesian Youth and Student Federation, the Indonesian Women's Movement Association, the Indonesian Farmers' Front, and the Indonesian Scientists' Association. On March 12, 1966, they banned the Indonesian Communist Party "and all organizations with the same objectives and under its control and protection." The Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel have also closed many schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions.
    The Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel have also maliciously persecuted legally established international organizations, diplomatic missions, and other delegations that are fully supported by the Indonesian government and people. For example, they attacked and arrested the staff of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association in Jakarta, flagrantly interfered with its activities, and forced it to move out of Indonesia last year. On November 17th, they raided the office of the Malayan National Liberation League delegation and arrested its four leading members. On March 25th of this year, they closed the Jakarta branch of Xinhua News Agency. In addition, the Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel have launched bloody persecution against overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia, carrying out a frenzied anti-China movement. They have even broken into the Chinese Embassy, Consulate General, and Commercial Counselor's Office in Jakarta several times, and beaten Chinese officials. They have also completely violated the principles of international law and committed many other barbaric crimes.
    These large numbers of arrested and killed patriots and democrats, as well as the banned progressive mass organizations, are all patriotic revolutionary forces opposing imperialism and old and new colonialism. The international organizations, diplomatic missions, and other delegations that have been forced to withdraw from the country or have been severely persecuted are steadfast opponents of imperialism and old and new colonialism. The People's Republic of China, which the Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel are trying to slander, is the pillar of the international anti-imperialist united front. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Indonesian reactionaries' and those military personnel's brutal, barbaric, and inhumane crimes not only harm the interests of the Indonesian people, seriously endanger Indonesia's revolution, independence, and sovereignty, but also represent a setback for the Bandung Spirit of anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism, for the growth and development of emerging forces, and for the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism and old and new colonialism. These crimes have greatly helped imperialism and all reactionaries, especially U.S. imperialism. Similarly, these crimes undermine the Afro-Asian solidarity for which the people of Asia and Africa are waging a life-and-death struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism.
    The Thai Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee exercises the right stipulated in Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Charter, which allows us to "take all measures deemed necessary to promote Afro-Asian solidarity and thwart attempts by imperialist countries to undermine the freedom of any member state of this solidarity organization."
    Therefore, we strongly condemn and resolutely protest against the Indonesian reactionaries and those military personnel, demanding that they immediately stop these heinous crimes, stop trampling on the principles of international law, and avoid continuing to undermine Afro-Asian solidarity and the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism led by the United States.

    泰国亚非人民团结委员会发表新闻公报
    坚决抗议印尼反动派镇压爱国进步力量
    谴责印尼反动派疯狂反华并一再袭击中国使领馆
    新华社十八日讯　泰国亚非人民团结委员会在京人士向新华社提供了泰国亚非人民团结委员会十三日发表的新闻公报。公报强烈谴责和抗议印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人逮捕、拘留、镇压和杀害印度尼西亚爱国者和民主人士的罪行。公报全文如下：
    受到美帝国主义唆使和支持的印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人，以“镇压九月三十日运动支持者”为借口，自一九六五年十月以来，恣意逮捕和杀害印度尼西亚爱国者和民主人士。甚至根据苏加诺总统委任的“搜集事实委员会”的报告，在一九六五年十二月二十七日至一九六六年一月六日这一期间的调查透露：在巴厘、东爪哇、中爪哇和北苏门答腊部分地区就有七万八千五百人被杀害、十万六千人被逮捕（我们相信这些估计是非常保守的，而真实数字还要大的多）。印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人任意禁止许多进步群众团体，如人民青年团、印度尼西亚大学生运动联盟、印度尼西亚大学生学生会、印度尼西亚青年和学生联合会、印度尼西亚妇女运动协会、印度尼西亚农民阵线、印度尼西亚科学家协会。一九六六年三月十二日他们禁止了印度尼西亚共产党“以及所有同它同一宗旨和在它统属、庇护下的组织”。印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人还封闭了许多学校、学院、大学及其他院校。
    印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人还恶毒地迫害受到印度尼西亚政府和人民全力支持的、合法地建立起来的国际组织、外交使团及其它代表团。譬如，他们袭击和逮捕了在雅加达的亚非新闻工作者协会的工作人员，悍然干涉它的活动，并且迫使它在去年迁出印度尼西亚。十一月十七日他们搜劫了马来亚民族解放同盟代表团办事处，并且逮捕了它的四位领导成员。今年三月二十五日他们封闭了新华社雅加达分社。此外，印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人对居住在印度尼西亚的华侨发动了血腥迫害，进行着疯狂的反华运动。他们甚至好几次闯入驻雅加达的中国大使馆、总领事馆和商务参赞处，并且殴打中国官员，他们还完全破坏国际法原则，犯下了许多其它野蛮的罪行。
    这些大量被逮捕和遭到杀害的爱国者和民主人士以及被禁止的进步群众团体都是反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的爱国革命力量。被迫撤出该国或严重地遭到迫害的国际组织、外交使团及其它代表团都是帝国主义和新老殖民主义的坚定不移的反对者。印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人企图加以污蔑的中华人民共和国是国际反帝统一战线的支柱。因此，可以得出这样的结论：印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人的粗暴的、野蛮的、不人道的罪行不仅损害了印度尼西亚人民的利益，严重地危及印度尼西亚的革命、独立及主权，而且对反帝反殖的万隆精神、对新兴力量的成长与发展、对全世界人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争是一个挫折。这些罪行对帝国主义及所有反动派，特别是对美帝国主义帮了大忙。同样，这些罪行破坏了亚非两洲人民为之而正在进行生死斗争的反对帝国主义及新老殖民主义的亚非团结。
    泰国亚非人民团结委员会行使亚非人民团结组织章程第二条第四款所规定的权利，这种权利允许我们“采取各种被认为必要的措施，促进亚非团结和粉碎帝国主义国家阴谋破坏本团结组织中任何成员国自由的企图。”
    因此，我们强烈谴责和坚决抗议印度尼西亚反动派和那些军人，要求他们立刻停止这些滔天罪行，停止践踏国际法原则并且避免继续破坏亚非团结和反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。
