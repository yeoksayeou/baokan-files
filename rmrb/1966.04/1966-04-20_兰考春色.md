    This year's climate seems somewhat special: according to the lunar calendar, it is almost the time of Qingming Festival. However, strong cold air is attacking the middle reaches of the Yellow River region time and time again. On February 21st, Lankao had just experienced a heavy snowfall. On the evening of March 5th, the cold wind howled, snow fell heavily, and the temperature suddenly dropped to over ten degrees below zero.
    The Yellow River froze once again.
    On the land of Lankao, the snow was a foot deep, and everywhere was a white, jade-like world, a scene of icy and snowy northern scenery.
    However, spring is, after all, spring.
    In the past few days, I have traveled to many places in Lankao. No matter where I went, I saw delightful spring scenes everywhere.
    As I walked along the long Yellow River embankment, I saw rows of peach and apricot trees on both sides of the embankment, their branches weighed down by snow, clusters of pink flowers blooming against the wind and snow. Their colors were so bright and so pure. It was as if they were deliberately competing with the white snow on their branches, vying for victory.
    When I reached the Black Dragon Pool west of Hongmiao Village, I saw that the reeds planted here by the bank of the vast pool, according to Comrade Jiao Yulu's instructions, were also piercing through the accumulated snow and thin ice, stretching their sword-like green leaves towards the sky; in the famous Hancun, which embodies the spirit of the people of Lankao, on the first experimental plot that Jiao Yulu personally constructed, I saw that the green wheat seedlings were also using their verdant pointed leaves to push aside the accumulated snow and strive to sprout and grow upwards; when I passed through the fields of Lao Hanling and the sandy beaches of the Yifeng Orchard, I saw that the lush paulownia trees in the fields of Lao Hanling were covered with strings of brownish-yellow flower buds; the apple trees on the sandy beaches of Yifeng were also bursting forth with clusters of pink flowers, emitting an intoxicating fragrance. ...
    However, the spring scenes I am referring to here are not only the blooming of apricot flowers on the Yellow River embankment, the growth of wheat seedlings in the experimental fields of Hancun, the sprouting of reeds by the Black Dragon Pool, and the budding of apples on the sandy beaches of Yifeng, and other natural springs. More importantly, they are the spring of thought of the 360,000 heroic people of Lankao.
    In those years, Comrade Jiao Yulu held high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and blazed a bright path of self-reliance on the sandy land of Lankao. At the same time, he also sowed the red seeds of Mao Zedong Thought in the hearts of the 360,000 people of Lankao. Now, these red seeds are sprouting, growing, blossoming, and bearing fruit everywhere on the land of Lankao, showing a splendid and boundless spring scene. In the past few days, in the many places I have visited, I have seen this magnificent spring scene of people's thoughts everywhere. I have felt the development and promotion of the Jiao Yulu spirit everywhere.
    Now, an unprecedented production upsurge is surging on the land of Lankao. The class ranks armed with Mao Zedong Thought by Comrade Jiao Yulu in those years—the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and commune members—are, under the inspiration of the Jiao Yulu spirit, building a newer and more beautiful Lankao with soaring enthusiasm, and drawing newer and more beautiful pictures. Despite the howling cold winds and heavy snowfall in recent days, thousands upon thousands of commune members are still going to work in the wind and snow, and working in the fields in the face of severe cold. On both sides of the Longhai Railway, in the vast fields along the Yellow River, people can be seen working hard in groups. Some are digging ditches and canals to dredge the drainage and waterlogging systems; some are turning over silt to suppress sand to control wind and sand disasters; some are building terrace fields to eliminate saline-alkali land; some are digging wells and rivers to build water conservancy projects. ...The unrestrained singing and the majestic sounds of labor spread everywhere across the land of Lankao through the white snowy curtain.
    Ah! The four red flags established by Comrade Jiao Yulu during his lifetime: the spirit of Hancun, the determination of Qinzhai, the road of Shuangyangshu, and the vigor of Zhaoduolou. Now there are not just four, but ten, dozens, hundreds. It can even be said that red flags are flying everywhere in Lankao.
    A few days ago, I came to Qinzhai.
    When Jiao Yulu first came to this village, it was still a vast expanse of white, barren saline-alkali land. Jiao Yulu brought the method of turning over silt, digging ditches, and building terrace fields to the people of Qinzhai. At the same time, he illuminated the hearts of the people of Qinzhai with the red light of Mao Zedong Thought. The first to respond to this method was the old poor peasant Qin Yongli. This old man, over seventy years old, who had experienced many vicissitudes, believed that this method would definitely work and that the ideal of "turning a white expanse into a green expanse" [Note] could be realized. From then on, the people of Qinzhai, with the ambitious goal of changing the world, began the arduous struggle to conquer the saline-alkali land. Qin Yongli, old but vigorous, took the lead and became a vanguard and an old hero in conquering alkaline wasteland in this fierce battle.
    Jiao Yulu's ideal did not fail. Although he did not live to see the wheat ears growing on the saline-alkali land of Qinzhai, one year after his death, Qinzhai, and even all the reformed saline-alkali land in Lankao, was covered with green wheat seedlings and achieved unprecedented good harvests.
    "The Foolish Old Man is determined to move mountains, vowing to turn a poor village into a prosperous one."
    This slogan written on the streets of Qinzhai is the vow of the people of Qinzhai and also their determination. Now, Qinzhai's production has greatly increased, from a yield of 26 jin per mu in 1962 to 205 jin per mu in 1965, from eating state-supplied grain to selling surplus grain to the state. However, the people of Qinzhai did not relax their determination because of this. On the contrary, inspired by the Jiao Yulu spirit, they held the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and continued to forge ahead courageously.
    An unprecedented production upsurge is surging on the fields of Qinzhai. Every day before dawn, the men and women commune members of Qinzhai rush to the fields. Qin Jia'an, the deputy secretary of the brigade, told me that there has never been such unity and such enthusiasm in Qinzhai. Even the elderly and children are taking the initiative to work hard. The cadres' dissuasion is useless.
    The struggle goal of striving for "meeting the standard" (i.e., realizing the "National Agricultural Development Program") for grain and the beautiful blueprint of building a prosperous new Lankao are attracting everyone's heart. Now, they are digging drainage ditches and building new terrace fields. On that crowded construction site, I saw a remarkable old man. This old man is over seventy years old, and his hair and beard have turned white, but his body is still very strong, and his fiery energy is even more fierce than that of young people. This is the famous Qin Yongli, representative of the provincial Poor Peasants Association, a capable and daring old general. This old Foolish Old Man, armed with Mao Zedong Thought by Comrade Jiao Yulu in those years, who feared neither heaven nor earth and was wholeheartedly engaged in revolution, is now, under the stimulation of the Jiao Yulu spirit, advancing courageously towards new goals.
    Look, what a moving scene!
    This gray-haired old man stood on the field with his tall body, facing the cold wind, opening his collar, and exposing his broad chest, as if to embrace the entire world in his chest. He raised his hoe high and dug it down forcefully, breaking through the frozen ground and turning over the soil that had been sleeping for many years (uncultivated alkaline wasteland). The heavy snow rushed in, and the flying snowflakes rushed into his bare chest wave after wave, but he ignored it and continued to wield the hoe, launching a war against the frozen land one blow after another.
    But what deeply touched my heart was not only the enthusiastic labor of old man Qin Yongli and the people of Qinzhai. More importantly, it was their hearts, their thoughts, those hearts that became redder and redder in the storm of struggle, and the thoughts that became redder and redder.
    People told me: Qin Yongli has a nickname called "Mr. Nosy." Because in the commune, he likes to mind "other people's business." He wants to control who goes to work late, he wants to control whose sheep eat the wheat seedlings in the fields, he wants to control who... In short, he wants to control anything that is detrimental to the collective and detrimental to the country. Someone jokingly and sarcastically said to him: "Give it a rest, old man, you are so old, what are you still meddling in? Does it mean that we won't farm if you die?"
    When Qin Yongli heard this, his white beard bristled with anger, and he said loudly:
    "What? Not control? No way! As long as I live for one day, I will control for one day!" The old man's red heart of love for the collective deeply moved me, and I couldn't help but start talking to him. I asked him: Why do you mind so many things? Why do you work so hard?
    "Why? For the revolution! For the country, for socialism." Old man Qin replied very simply, "Back then, when Secretary Jiao was alive, he established a great banner for our Qinzhai, called 'Qinzhai's Determination'. But you should think about it carefully, what does the word 'determination' mean? Does it just mean that we should treat a few pieces of saline-alkali land and get a good harvest for one or two years?"
    When Qin Yongli said this, his eyes stared at me, but without waiting for me to answer, he continued loudly: "No, no, it's definitely not just such a determination; it is to treat all the saline-alkali land and strive for good harvests every year. That's not enough, we must also treat all the saline-alkali land in Lankao and strive for good harvests every year in all of Lankao. Support the country, support Vietnam, support all the people who are still being bullied by imperialism. This is the determination of our Qinzhai."
    Qin Yongli's last few words were very powerful, every word and every sentence was like a nail drilled into wood. Listening to him, I couldn't help but get excited. After a while, old man Qin smiled and said to me again: "My nickname 'Mr. Nosy' is about to be removed. Because in the past few years, the people in our team have been reading Chairman Mao's books every day. With his old man's teachings, there is no need for this 'Mr. Nosy' of mine to interfere here and there. Look, how enthusiastically and united everyone is working now. With such unity, what difficulties can't be overcome, what can't be done? Take this wheat, for example, look how fertile and lush it grows. From the time I remember, to now for sixty or seventy years, our Qinzhai has never grown such good crops."
    Following his hand, I saw that the wheat seedlings on those terrace fields were growing very densely and vigorously. The color was so green that it turned black, and the broad wheat leaves swayed happily in the wind and snow, as if they wanted to shake off the snowflakes on their bodies, straighten their upright waists, and draw out plump wheat ears, adding a more magnificent color to this beautiful land of the motherland.
    "Tell me, why are the crops growing so well this year?" Qin Yongli asked. His eyes stared at me.
    "Because the hearts of you Qinzhai people are united, and your thoughts are red." I used his words, and also what was in my own heart, to answer him.
    "Right! Right! You've said it right." Qin Yongli clapped his hands and laughed heartily. "That's the principle. In a word, we must do as Chairman Mao says: revolution, resolute revolution, revolution to the end!" After saying that, he turned around and strode into the crowd, raised his hoe high, and started digging again and again.
    Looking at the white-bearded old man Qin Yongli, looking at the crowd fighting in the wind and snow, my heart was filled with excitement. Ah, how could I not be excited? Qin Yongli, an old poor peasant who was trampled underfoot in the old society, is now not only actively working at the advanced age of seventy-three, but also has the entire world in his heart and is looking at the entire universe. His labor is not for his own food and clothing, nor is it just for the change of Qinzhai and Lankao, but for the entire country, for the entire world revolution!
    What power has made an ordinary peasant become such a person with a broad mind, a long-term vision, and noble ideals? This is a very meaningful question. However, the answer is very clear, that is: Mao Zedong Thought, the great Mao Zedong Thought. And Comrade Jiao Yulu was the disseminator of this great thought. He traveled all over the land of Lankao and sowed the red seeds of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere. Now, this seed is blossoming and bearing fruit, and is being promoted and developed. Qin Yongli is just one of countless seeds.
    Lankao is advancing, and Mao Zedong Thought is shining everywhere in Lankao. However, the people of Lankao are not complacent.
    Yesterday, a responsible comrade of the Lankao County Party Committee told me that they will not only strive to make the current production better, but also launch a higher upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works among the vast cadres and commune members of the county. Through study, they want to further improve people's political thought and do a better job in creatively studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought.
    The spring breeze brings rain, which is another powerful measure and valuable spiritual weapon.
    We can fully expect that with the arrival of this upsurge in studying Chairman Mao's works, the heroic people of Lankao will surely hold higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and strive forward to further change the face of Lankao and for the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in the motherland. More cadres like Qin Yongli, who have the motherland in their hearts, have the world in their eyes, work wholeheartedly for the revolution, and farm wholeheartedly for the revolution, will surely emerge in the various communes and production teams of Lankao; a more splendid and beautiful spring scene will surely be added to the land of Lankao.

    Note: "Turning a white expanse into a green expanse" is Jiao Yulu's ideal for transforming saline-alkali land. Saline-alkali land is a white expanse, and if it is transformed and planted with crops, it will become a green expanse.

    兰考春色
    峻青
    今年的气候似乎有些特别：按照农历的节气，已经快到清明时节了。可强大的冷空气，却还一次又一次的袭击着黄河中游地区。二月二十一日，兰考刚降过了一场大雪，三月五日黄昏时分，寒风呼啸，大雪纷飞，气温骤然下降到零下十多度。
    黄河又一次结冰了。
    兰考大地上，雪深盈尺，到处是一片白茫茫的粉妆玉琢似的世界，一幅冰封雪冻的北国风光。
    然而，春天毕竟还是春天。
    几天来，我在兰考的大地上，走了很多地方。不论走到那里，到处都看到令人喜悦的大好春色。
    当我沿着漫长的黄河大堤行走的时候，我看到大堤两旁那一排排雪压枝头的桃杏丛中，一簇簇粉红色的花朵，正在迎着风雪开放。它们的颜色，又是那么皎洁，那么白净。简直象是故意要和那压在它们枝头上的白雪，比一比高低，争一个胜负。
    当我走到红庙村庄西头的黑龙潭边的时候，我看见那辽阔的水潭岸边，一丛丛当年按照焦裕禄同志的意见在这儿栽下的芦苇，也正透过积雪薄冰，把它们那利剑般的绿叶，向着天空伸展开去；在表现了兰考人民硬骨头精神的著名的韩村，在焦裕禄当年亲手构筑的第一块试验台田上，我看到，那青青的麦苗，也在用它们那碧绿的尖叶，拨开积雪，奋力地向上抽芽生长；当我走过老韩陵的田间和仪封果园沙滩的时候，我看到，老韩陵田野里那一大片茂密的泡桐树上，挂满了一串串土褐色的花蕾；仪封沙滩的苹果树上，也都绽出了一簇簇粉红色的花朵，散发出醉人的清香。……
    然而，我这里所说的春色，不仅是黄河大堤上杏花的盛开，韩村台田里麦苗的生长，黑龙潭边芦苇的抽芽，仪封沙滩苹果的含苞等等大自然的春天，更重要的，还是三十六万英雄的兰考人民思想上的春天。
    当年，焦裕禄同志高举毛泽东思想的红旗，在黄沙滚滚的兰考大地上，披荆斩棘地杀出一条自力更生的光明大路。同时，也在三十六万兰考人民心里，播下了毛泽东思想的红色种子。如今，这红色的种子正在兰考的大地上，到处抽芽生长，开花结果，展现出一派绚丽似锦的无边春色。几天来，在我所走过的许多地方，到处都看到这种人们思想上的绚丽春色。到处都感到焦裕禄精神的发扬光大。
    现在，一场规模空前的生产热潮正在兰考大地上波涛汹涌地开展起来。当年焦裕禄同志用毛泽东思想武装起来的阶级队伍——广大的贫下中农社员们正在焦裕禄精神的鼓舞下，以冲天的干劲，建设更新更美的兰考，编绘更新更美的图画。尽管连日来，寒风呼啸，大雪纷飞，可是，成千上万的社员们却仍然冒着风雪出工，顶着严寒下地。在陇海铁路两侧，在黄河岸边的辽阔的田野里，到处都看到人们成群结队的在进行着紧张的劳动。他们有的在挖沟开渠，疏通排涝系统；有的在翻淤压沙，治服风沙灾害；有的在构筑台田，消灭盐碱地；有的在打井挖河，兴修水利。……那奔放的歌声，雄壮的劳动声，透过白蒙蒙的雪幕，在兰考大地上四处飞扬。
    啊！焦裕禄同志生前树立起来的四面红旗：韩村的精神，秦寨的决心，双杨树的道路，赵垛楼的干劲。现在已经不止是四面，而是十面、几十面、几百面。甚至可以说，兰考遍地到处都是红旗招展。
    前几天，我来到了秦寨。
    当年焦裕禄第一次来到这个村庄的时候，这儿还到处是一片白茫茫的寸草不生的盐碱地。焦裕禄把翻淤开沟、构筑台田的办法带给了秦寨人民，同时，也用毛泽东思想的红灯照亮了秦寨人的心。第一个响应这个办法的是老贫农秦永利，这个久历沧桑的七十多岁的老汉，以他自己的亲身经历，认定这个办法一定可以行得通，“一片白变成一片青”〔注〕的理想一定可以实现。从那以后，秦寨人就以改天换地的雄心壮志，开始了征服盐碱地的艰苦斗争。而秦永利，就老当益壮，一马当先地成了这激烈战斗中的闯将、征服碱荒的老英雄。
    焦裕禄的理想没有落空。虽然他活着的时候没能看到秦寨盐碱地上长出的麦穗，但在他死后一年多的今天，秦寨，以至全兰考所有改造过的盐碱地上，到处都长起了青青的麦苗，获得了从未有过的好收成。
    “愚公立下移山志誓叫穷村变富村”
    这一条写在秦寨街头的标语，是秦寨人的誓言，也是秦寨人的决心。现在，秦寨的生产已经大大地增加了，他们从一九六二年的亩产量二十六斤增加到一九六五年的二百零五斤，从吃国家统销粮到向国家交售余粮。但是，秦寨人并不因此而松弛了自己的决心，相反地，他们在焦裕禄精神的鼓舞下，更高地举着毛泽东思想的红旗，继续奋勇前进。
    一场规模空前的生产热潮，正在秦寨的田野上汹涌澎湃地开展起来。每天天不亮，秦寨的男女社员们就争先恐后地向着田野上奔去。大队的副支书秦家安告诉我：在秦寨，从来没有过这样的齐心，这样的干劲。甚至连老人和小孩，也都主动地争着干活。干部们劝阻也没有用。
    争取粮食“上纲”（即实现“全国农业发展纲要”）的奋斗目标，建设富裕的新兰考的美好的蓝图在吸引着每一个人的心。现在，他们正在挖掘排水沟，构筑新台田。在那人山人海的劳动工地上，我看到了一个引人注目的老汉。这老汉，已经七十多岁了，头发胡须都已经变得雪白，可他的身体却依然是十分健壮，那股子火爆劲儿，简直比青年人还来得勇猛。这就是那个有名的秦永利，省贫协代表，能闯敢干的老将。这位当年焦裕禄同志用毛泽东思想武装起来的天不怕地不怕、一心闹革命的老愚公，现在，又在焦裕禄精神的激励下，向着新的奋斗目标，奋勇前进了。
    瞧，多么动人的情景啊！
    这皓首银髯的老人，他那高大的身躯，站立在田野上面，迎着寒风，敞开了衣襟，把他那宽阔的胸膛，袒露出来，仿佛要把整个的世界，拥抱在他的胸前。他高高地举起了镢头，用力地刨了下去，刨开了冰冻的地面，翻起了沉睡了多少年的泥土（从未耕种过的碱荒地）。大雪扑来了，那纷纷扬扬的雪片，一阵又一阵的扑进了他那裸露的胸脯上，但是，他理也不理，仍然挥舞着镢头，一下接一下地向着冰冻的土地开战。
    但是，深深打动了我的心坎的还不止是秦永利老汉和秦寨人的热火朝天的劳动干劲。更重要的还是他们的心，他们的思想，那在斗争的风暴中越炼越红的心，越炼越红的思想。
    人们告诉我：秦永利有个外号叫“管得宽”。因为在社里，他好管“闲事”，谁出工晚了他要管，谁的羊吃了田里的麦苗他要管，谁……总之，凡是不利于集体不利于国家的事，他都要管。有人半开玩笑半带讽刺地对他说：“拉倒吧，老大爷，你那么大年纪了，还管些什么？难道说你死了我们就不种地了吗？”
    秦永利听了，气得白胡子都扎撒了起来，大声说：
    “什么？不管？不行！只要我活一天，我就要管一天！”老人热爱集体的红心，使我深受感动，我忍不住和他攀谈了起来，我问他：为什么要管这多事？为什么要这样发狠的干？
    “为什么？为革命！为国家，为社会主义。”秦老汉回答得非常干脆，“想当年，焦书记在世的时候，给咱秦寨树起一面大旗，叫‘秦寨的决心’，可你好好琢磨琢磨，这‘决心’两个字，是什么意思？难道就只是叫咱治好几块盐碱地，得到一年二载好收成吗？”
    秦永利说到这里，眼睛定定地望着我，但是不等我回答，就大声地接着说：“不，不是，决不止是这样的决心；而是要治好所有的盐碱地，争得年年的好收成。那还不中，还要治好全兰考的盐碱地，争得全兰考的年年好收成。支援国家，支援越南，支援所有还受帝国主义欺负的人民。这，才是咱秦寨的决心”。
    秦永利这最后几句话，说得非常有力，每一句话，每一个字，都象钉子钻进了木头似的。我听着，也情不自禁的兴奋起来。停了一会儿，秦老汉又笑着对我说：“我这个‘管得宽’的外号快要免了。因为这几年来，俺队里的人天天读毛主席的书，有了他老人家的教导，就用不着俺这‘管得宽’去管东管西了。你看，现在大伙干得多么热火，多么齐心。有了这样的齐心，还有什么困难克服不了，还有什么事情做不到。就拿这麦子来说吧，你看，它长得多么肥壮，多么茂盛。从我记事起，到如今六七十年了，咱秦寨还从来没有长过这样好的庄稼呢。”
    我顺着他的手望去，果然看到在那一片片台田上面，麦苗长得非常茂密、茁壮，那颜色绿得发黑了，那宽阔的麦叶，在风雪中愉快地摇摆着，仿佛要抖掉那身上的雪花，挺起笔直的腰身，抽出肥大的麦穗，为这美好的祖国河山，添上一层更加绚丽的色彩。
    “你说，为什么今年的庄稼长得这么好？”秦永利问道。眼睛定定地看着我。
    “因为你们秦寨人的心齐了，思想红了。”我用他刚才说的话、也是我自己心里的话来回答了他。
    “对！对！这你就说对了。”秦永利双手一拍，哈哈地笑了起来。“就是这么个道理。一句话，俺们要照着毛主席他老人家说的那样做：革命，坚决革命，革命到底！”说罢，转回身去，大踏步地走进了人群里，高高地举起了镢头，一下又一下的刨了起来。
    我望着那白须飘飘的秦永利老汉，望着那在风雪中奋战的人群，心里充满了激动。啊，怎么能不激动呢？秦永利，这样一个在旧社会里被人踩在脚下的老贫农，如今，不仅以七十三岁的高龄还在积极的劳动，而且，他的心里，装着整个的世界，他的眼睛，望着整个的宇宙。他的劳动，不是为了他一个人的吃穿，也不止是为了秦寨和兰考面貌的改变，而是为了整个的国家，为了整个的世界革命！
    是什么力量使得一个普通农民成为这样一个具有宽阔的心胸、远大的眼光、高尚的理想的人呢？这是一个非常有意义的问题。但是，答案是十分清楚的，那就是：毛泽东思想，伟大的毛泽东思想。而焦裕禄同志，正是这伟大思想的传播者，他走遍了兰考的大地，到处都播下了毛泽东思想的红色种子。现在，这种子，正在开花结果，发扬光大。秦永利，只不过是这无数颗种子当中的一颗而已。
    兰考在前进，兰考到处都在放射着毛泽东思想的光辉。但是，兰考人民却并不自满。
    昨天，兰考县委一位负责同志告诉我：他们不仅要力争把当前的生产搞得更好，而且，还要在全县的广大干部和社员中，掀起一个更高的学习毛主席著作的热潮。要通过学习，把人们的政治思想，更加提高一步，把活学活用毛泽东思想，做得更好。
    春风化雨，这又是一番有力的措施，宝贵的精神武装。
    我们完全可以期望，随着这个大学毛主席著作高潮的到来，英雄的兰考人民，一定会更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，为进一步改变兰考面貌，为祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，而奋勇前进。兰考的各个公社和生产队里，一定会出现更多象秦永利那样心怀祖国、放眼世界、一心为革命劳动、一心为革命种田的干将；兰考的大地上，一定会增添一番更加绚烂更加美丽的大好春色。
    注：“一片白变成一片青”，是焦裕禄对改造盐碱地的理想。盐碱地是一片白，改造好了种上庄稼，就会变成一片青。
