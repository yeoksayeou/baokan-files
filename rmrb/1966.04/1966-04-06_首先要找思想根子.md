　　A grain processing factory in a small market town in Zhuji County, Zhejiang Province, processed grain for nearby farmers and was always very busy. Last year, after a bumper harvest of spring crops, the processing task increased, and the factory also drew people to support agriculture. The task became heavier, and the personnel decreased. What to do? At first, the Party branch advocated grasping technology and called on workers to put forward rationalization proposals. However, many workers did not fully understand the significance of supporting agriculture and had the mentality of "production has reached its peak" and fear of difficulty. Therefore, not many suggestions were put forward, and the problem was not solved. Later, the Party branch studied Chairman Mao's works with the problem in mind, realizing that "mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the whole Party to carry out great political struggles. If this task is not resolved, all the Party's political tasks cannot be completed." Therefore, focusing on the workers' active thinking, they studied Comrade Mao Zedong's relevant works and advanced experiences from other places and launched discussions. The workers gained an understanding of the great significance of supporting agriculture and overcame their negative emotions and fear of difficulty. Everyone actively used their brains and came up with ideas, putting forward many rationalization proposals, achieving the goal of reducing personnel, increasing production, and ensuring quality.
　　When doctors treat illnesses, they observe, listen, inquire, and feel the pulse, aiming to find the root cause of the disease. Only by finding the root cause can they prescribe the right medicine and cure the illness. The same is true for the Party branch's work. When encountering a problem, one should first find its root cause, especially its ideological root cause. Only by finding the root cause can we solve the key issues based on it. If we abandon the fundamental and pursue the superficial, not grasping the root cause but only circling around the trivial issues, the problem will never be solved well.

    首先要找思想根子
    浙江省诸暨县一个小集镇的粮食加工厂，为附近农民加工粮食，一直忙不过来。去年小春丰收，加工任务增加，厂里又抽人去支援农业。任务加重，人员减少，怎么办？开始，党支部主张抓技术，号召工人提合理化建议。但是，不少工人对支援农业的意义认识不足，并有生产到顶思想和畏难情绪，因此，建议提得不多，没有解决问题。后来，党支部带着问题学习毛主席著作，认识到“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”于是，针对职工的活思想，学习毛泽东同志的有关著作和外地先进经验，展开讨论。职工对支援农业的重大意义有了认识，克服了消极畏难情绪。大家纷纷动脑筋，想办法，提出了很多合理化建议，做到了减人，增产，保证质量。
    医生治病，望、闻、问、切，目的是要找到病根子。只有找到了病根子，才能对症下药，药到病除。党支部做工作也是这样。遇到一个问题，首先应该找它的根子，特别是找它的思想根子。根子找到了，才能据以解决关键问题。如果舍本逐末，不抓根子，只在枝节问题上兜圈子，问题是决不会解决得好的。
