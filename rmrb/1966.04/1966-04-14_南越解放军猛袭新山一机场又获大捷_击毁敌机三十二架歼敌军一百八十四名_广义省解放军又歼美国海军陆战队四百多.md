    South Vietnamese Liberation Army Launches Fierce Attack on Tan Son Nhut Airport, Achieves Another Great Victory
    32 Enemy Aircraft Destroyed, 184 Enemy Soldiers Eliminated
    Liberation Army in Quang Ngai Province Eliminates Over 400 U.S. Marines
    Editor's Note: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces have once again launched a surprise attack on Tan Son Nhut Airport, located only six kilometers from the center of Saigon, achieving a glorious victory. This battle was fought beautifully. Despite the fact that the U.S.-puppet clique strengthens its defenses after each attack, it is still unable to prevent the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces from penetrating the outskirts of Saigon and launching repeated attacks on this airport, achieving even greater results each time. This new victory once again demonstrates that no matter how many troops the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs increase, or what new types of weapons they use, they cannot change their predicament of being passively beaten.
    The U.S. aggressors always boast about their "air superiority." In fact, this myth has long been bankrupt. The outcome of war, in the final analysis, is determined by the fighting of ground forces. When the Vietnamese people use the magic weapon of people's war to deal with the U.S. aggressors, the so-called "air superiority" of the United States can in no way save its ground inferiority. The South Vietnamese army and people can not only shoot down enemy planes in the sky, but also destroy enemy planes parked on the ground. U.S. planes cannot play any great role in the sky, but they have become targets for the South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces to attack at the airport. Isn't it very clear that people are stronger than weapons?
    Xinhua News Agency, April 13th dispatch from Saigon: The South Vietnamese Liberation Armed Forces launched a fierce attack on Tan Son Nhut Airport, located only six kilometers from the center of Saigon, in the early hours of April 13th, causing chaos in this airport, one of the largest strategic air force bases of the United States in South Vietnam. The U.S. aggressor troops suffered heavy casualties, and many aircraft were destroyed and damaged.
    Preliminary reports from Western news agencies say that a total of 184 U.S. and puppet troops were killed or wounded in the attack, the vast majority of whom were U.S. aggressors; 32 aircraft were destroyed; and an oil depot with a storage capacity of 420,000 gallons at the airport was hit and caught fire, with the fire burning for eight and a half hours without being extinguished.
    The headquarters of the Seventh Air Force of the South Vietnamese puppet clique is located here, and Nguyen Cao Ky, the head of the South Vietnamese puppet regime, also lives here. A total of 15,000 people, including more than 10,000 U.S. aggressor troops, live in this airport area.
    According to reports, the Liberation Armed Forces' surprise attack on the airport began shortly after midnight. They used mortars to bombard the airport fiercely from three sides. The main areas of the airport were hit by artillery shells, the main runway was damaged, and long-range flights could not land here. Many U.S. aggressor troops died before they had time to wake up from their sleep, and many U.S. troops living in the tent area desperately fled barefoot, but were killed and wounded by the Liberation Army's small arms.
    After the shelling began, Nguyen Cao Ky was terrified and hurriedly took his family on a helicopter to escape, narrowly escaping death.
    The report said that the Liberation Army's mortar shells hit many enemy planes parked on the apron. The airport's oil depot was hit by the first batch of artillery shells fired by the Liberation Army, causing a violent explosion. Fierce flames shot into the sky, and the fire could be seen several miles away.
    The airport was immediately sealed off after the attack. Only ambulances carrying the wounded and the corpses of the bombed U.S. soldiers could enter. All the lights in the airport were turned off.
    A United Press International dispatch said that four hours after the shelling, some troops were still on alert. Nearby U.S. military hospitals were filled with wounded. A U.S. military spokesman lamented that it was "extremely difficult" to avoid such surprise attacks. U.S. Commander in Vietnam Westmoreland "inspected" the battered airport on the morning of the 13th. Standing next to the wreckage of the aircraft, he told reporters that some more seriously wounded U.S. soldiers had died, and he "didn't know how many more deaths there would be" when he spoke of the U.S. military casualties in the attack.
    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Hanoi on the 13th, the South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency reported that the Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Ngai Province, South Vietnam, annihilated another 442 U.S. Marines in the anti-"mopping up" battle in the western region of Son Tinh District on March 29th. On that day, a battalion of U.S. Marines scurried into Phuc Loc Village, Thinh Son Township, in the western region of Son Tinh District. The Liberation Armed Forces of Quang Ngai Province, who had repeatedly defeated the U.S. Marines, had long laid a trap. When the U.S. Marines had just gotten off their helicopters, they immediately surrounded them and dealt them a head-on blow, causing heavy casualties to the U.S. military battalion.

### 南越解放军猛袭新山一机场又获大捷  击毁敌机三十二架歼敌军一百八十四名  广义省解放军又歼美国海军陆战队四百多

    南越解放军猛袭新山一机场又获大捷
    击毁敌机三十二架歼敌军一百八十四名
    广义省解放军又歼美国海军陆战队四百多
    编者按：越南南方解放武装力量又一次奇袭距西贡市中心只有六公里之遥的新山一机场，取得了辉煌的胜利。这一仗打得漂亮。尽管美伪集团在每一次遭袭击之后，就加强一次防卫，但是仍然无法防止南越解放武装力量深入到西贡的市郊，对这个机场进行一次再一次的袭击，而且取得一次比一次巨大的战果。这回的新胜利，再一次表明，美国侵略者及其走狗，不论增加多少兵力，也不论使用什么样的新式武器，都改变不了他们被动挨打的困境。
    美国侵略者总是吹嘘它的“空中优势”。事实上，这种神话早就破产了。战争的胜负，归根到底，决定于地面部队的战斗。当越南人民用人民战争的法宝来对付美国侵略者的时候，美国的所谓“空中优势”就无论如何也挽救不了它的地面劣势。南越军民不仅可以打天上的敌机，而且可以摧毁停在地面上的敌机。美国飞机在天上起不了什么了不起的作用，在机场上却成了南越解放武装力量攻击的靶子。人比武器更强，这不是十分清楚的吗？
    新华社十三日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十三日凌晨对距离西贡市中心只有六公里多的新山一机场发动了猛烈的袭击，使这个美国在南越的最大的战略空军基地之一的机场内顿时一片混乱，美国侵略军伤亡累累，许多飞机被击毁击伤。
    西方通讯社的初步消息说，在这次袭击中共有一百八十四名美伪军被打死打伤，其中绝大部分是美国侵略者；有三十二架飞机被击毁；机场内的一个储量为四十二万加仑的油库被击中起火，大火燃烧了八个半小时没有熄灭。
    南越傀儡集团的空军第七航空队的总部就设在这里，南越傀儡头子阮高其也住在这里。总共有一万五千人，其中有一万多名美国侵略军，住在这个机场地区。
    据报道，解放武装力量对这个机场的奇袭是子夜过后不久开始的。他们用迫击炮从机场的三面猛烈进行轰击，机场的主要地区都挨了炮弹，主要跑道遭到破坏，远程班机无法在这里着陆。不少美国侵略军还没有来得及从睡梦中醒来就丧了命，许多住在帐篷区内的美军，光着脚丫拼命地向外逃跑，但又遭到了解放军的小型武器的杀伤。
    炮轰开始后，阮高其惊恐万状，他慌忙携带眷属坐上直升飞机逃跑，险些丧命。
    消息说，解放军的迫击炮弹击中了很多停机场上的敌机。机场油库被解放军的第一批炮弹击中，发出了猛烈的爆炸声，熊熊的火焰冲上了天空，好几哩外都可以看到火光。
    这个机场被袭后就马上封锁起来。只有载运伤员和被炸死的美国人尸体的救护车才能够进去。机场的电灯全灭了。
    合众国际社一条消息说，炮击以后四小时，一些军队仍然处于戒备状态。附近的美军医院住满了伤员。一个美军发言人哀叹，要避免这种奇袭“十分困难”。侵越美军司令威斯特摩兰十三日上午“视察”了这个被打得乱七八糟的机场，他在飞机残骸旁边告诉记者这次美军遭受的伤亡时说，又有一些受重伤的美军死亡，他“不知道还有多少死亡”。
    据新华社河内十三日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广义省解放武装力量三月二十九日在山晶县西部地区的反“扫荡”战斗中，又歼灭美国海军陆战队四百四十二名。这一天，美国海军陆战队一个营向山晶县西部地区的靖山乡福禄村窜犯。曾经多次把美国海军陆战队打得丢盔弃甲的广义省解放武装力量，早就布下罗网，当美国海军陆战队刚从直升飞机上下来的时候，就立即加以包围，给予迎头痛击，使这营美军遭受惨重伤亡。（附图片）
