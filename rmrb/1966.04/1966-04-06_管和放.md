    Regarding various tasks in the countryside, the Party must exercise unified leadership. Unified leadership refers to giving prominence to politics. This means that the Party must manage the major issues in the work, manage the implementation of the Party's policies and guidelines, manage ideological and political work, and manage Party building.
    The administrative affairs and daily production of a production brigade are very complex and heavy. If the Party branch secretary takes care of all these things, how can he manage everything, how can he do everything well? Wang Liansheng, the Party branch secretary of Xiadianzi Brigade, Shajianzi Commune, Huanren County, used to take care of everything himself, and he was extremely busy, but everyone criticized him for not doing his "proper job." A person's energy and time are limited. If the "squad leader" is entangled in some trivial and specific matters, of course, it is impossible to manage major issues well. At the same time, if he plays a "solo show" and cannot give play to the enthusiasm and initiative of others, others will also have opinions.
    To manage major issues well, the Party branch secretary must adhere to the principle of unified leadership and division of labor, and delegate some administrative affairs that should and can be delegated. Delegating is for better control; to control better, it is necessary to delegate appropriately. Of course, delegating is not letting things drift, but delegating affairs to certain cadres to manage and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all cadres. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The responsibility of leaders, in summary, is mainly two things: to come up with ideas and to use cadres." The branch secretary should mobilize everyone to manage affairs, not replace everyone to manage affairs. Only by mobilizing the strength of all parties can the work be done well.
    To truly achieve managing what should be managed and delegating what should be delegated, we must believe in the wisdom of the masses and believe in the power of the masses. As long as you delegate, they can definitely do a good job. At first, they may not have experience, which requires helping them, urging them, and checking on them. Over time, with experience, they will naturally do well.
    Having both control and delegation is a leadership art. Comrades who do grassroots work in the Party should strive to master this leadership art.

    管和放
    对于农村各项工作，党要进行统一领导。统一领导，指的是政治挂帅。这就是说，党要管工作中的重大问题，管党的方针政策的贯彻，管思想政治工作，管党的建设。
    一个生产大队的行政事务、日常生产是很复杂很繁重的。如果党的支部书记把这些事情都管起来，怎能忙得过来，怎能都做好呢？桓仁县沙尖子公社下甸子大队党支部书记王连生，过去事事包揽，忙得不可开交，大家却批评他不务“正业”。一个人的精力、时间是有限的，如果“班长”尽被一些琐细的具体事务缠住，当然就不可能管好重大事情。同时，自己唱“独角戏”，不能发挥别人的积极性、主动性，别人也有意见。
    党支部书记要管好重大事情，必须坚持统一领导，分工负责的原则，放下一些应该和可以放下的行政事务。放，是为了更好地管；要更好地管，就必须适当地放。当然，放，并不是放任自流，而是把事情放给一定的干部去管，去充分调动所有干部的积极性。毛泽东同志说，“领导者的责任，归结起来，主要地是出主意、用干部两件事。”支部书记要发动大家来管事，而不是代替大家去管事。只有把各方面的力量都调动起来，工作才能做得好。
    要真正做到该管的管，该放的放，就要相信群众的智慧，相信群众的力量。你只要放了，他们是完全可以办得好的。起初，他们也可能没有经验，这就要帮助他们，督促、检查他们，时间长了，有了经验，自然就会办好了。
    有管又有放，这是一种领导艺术。做党的基层工作的同志，要努力掌握这种领导艺术。
