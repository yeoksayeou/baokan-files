    Such a "Strong Contrast"	Gao Yu
    The film "The Draft" mainly depicts the contradictions between the Bao Chief Wang Mazi and the landlord Li Laoshan, and also the plight of the poor peasant Jiang Guofu's family. The film's directors said that the purpose of doing this was to "form a strong contrast with the landlord Li Laoshan's family." This is utter nonsense. It's named a "strong contrast," but it's more like "mutual foils." From the film, we cannot see the different class positions and class destinies of the landlord Li Laoshan and the poor peasant Jiang Guofu at all, but rather they are birds of a feather, all victims, all targets of extortion by the Kuomintang government!
    A "contrast" makes everything clear—
    1. At the beginning of the film, Li Laoshan and his wife are complaining bitterly: "In these times, I really don't know which ancestral gods and Buddhas' tombs we've offended!" "Grain, funds, this donation today, that donation tomorrow, the bailiff dogs are always here, one after another like debt collectors sitting in the hall refusing to leave."
    And Jiang Guofu also shouts when he appears: "These past two years have been really unlucky," and to pay the draft fee, "all the pots, pans, bowls, bedding, and cotton wadding have been pawned and sold."
    2. Jiang Guofu paid a total of 5,200 yuan to exempt his son from being drafted.
    And Li Laoshan was even more unlucky. Not only was he extorted 4,000 yuan, but Wang Baochief blatantly swindled him out of another 4,000 yuan.
    3. Jiang Guofu's family was driven to ruin, his eldest grandson was beaten to death, his son went up the mountain to become a bandit, and he himself was beaten to death, leaving behind a widowed daughter-in-law and an orphaned grandson without support.
    And in Li Laoshan's family, the eldest son is away, the second son fled outside to do petty business, and the third son, who is twenty-six or seven years old, has to pretend to be a boy soldier and suffer hunger and abuse in a primary school.
    Such a "contrast" clearly shows how "strongly" similar the situations of the landlord Li Laoshan and the poor peasant Jiang Guofu are! We want to ask the directors of "The Draft," where in the world is there such a thing? Isn't your "strong contrast" putting the landlord and the peasant "into one"? Isn't your "strong contrast" promoting the theory of class reconciliation!

    如此“强烈对比”	高瑜
    影片《抓壮丁》主要是写保长王麻子和地主李老栓的矛盾，也写了贫农姜国富一家的遭遇。影片编导者说这样做的目的是为了“与地主李老栓一家形成强烈对比”。这真是胡说八道。名曰“强烈对比”，不如说是“互相陪衬”。从影片里我们完全看不到地主李老栓和贫农姜国富的不同阶级立场和阶级命运，而是同病相怜，都是受迫害者，都是国民党政府敲诈勒索的对象！
    “对比”一下，就一目了然——
    一、影片一开始，李老栓夫妻俩就在怨天尤人地诉苦：“这年头真不晓得犯了哪一官祖神菩萨的坟山咯！”“粮呀，款呀，今天这个捐，明天那个捐，差狗子一天不离，接二连三象催命鬼一样坐在堂屋里不走。”
    而姜国富一出场也喊道：“这两年实在天心不顺”，为付壮丁费“锅盆碗盏、铺盖棉絮都当尽卖绝了”。
    二、姜国富为了儿子免丁先后付了五千二百元。
    而李老栓更倒霉，他被敲去四千元不说，还被王保长明目张胆地骗去四千元。
    三、姜国富一家被逼得家破人亡，大孙子被打死，儿子上山当了土匪，自己被打死，留下寡媳孤孙无依无靠。
    而李老栓一家，大娃子在外，二娃子逃到外边做小买卖，三娃子二十六七岁了还要伪装童子军在小学校里挨饿受气。
    这么一“对比”，就可以清清楚楚地看到地主李老栓和贫农姜国富之间的处境是多么“强烈”地相同啊！我们要问《抓壮丁》的编导者，世界上哪有这样的事情呢？你们这样的“强烈对比”，不是把地主和农民“合二而一”了吗！你们这样的“强烈对比”，不正是在宣扬阶级调和论吗！
