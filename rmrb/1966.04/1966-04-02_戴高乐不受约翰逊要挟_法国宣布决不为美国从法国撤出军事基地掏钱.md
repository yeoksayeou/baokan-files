    According to Xinhua News Agency, Paris, March 31st, French government spokesman Yvon Bourges announced on the 31st that France refuses to bear any costs required for the U.S. withdrawal from bases in France. Since De Gaulle made the request for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and bases from France, U.S. officials have repeatedly mentioned the issue of over a billion dollars in relocation costs in public and private conversations, as a means of coercing France. In response to this U.S. coercion, Bourges told reporters after a cabinet meeting presided over by De Gaulle today: "Once France ceases to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, we have no obligation to share the costs required for the relocation of U.S. bases from France." United Press International also quoted French officials as saying that France will not pay any price for those facilities that cannot be removed (such as oil pipelines, airports, buildings, etc.).

    法国宣布决不为美国从法国撤出军事基地掏钱
  据新华社巴黎三十一日电　法国政府发言人伊冯·布歇三十一日宣布，法国拒绝担负美国撤离在法国的基地所需的任何费用。自从戴高乐提出美国军队和基地撤离法国的要求以后，美国官员在公开和私下谈话中一再提到十亿多美元的迁移费用问题，作为对法国的要挟。针对美国的这种要挟，布歇在今天戴高乐主持的内阁会议后向记者们说：“一俟法国停止参加北大西洋公约组织，我们就没有义务分担美国基地迁出法国所需的费用。”合众国际社还引用法国官员的话说，法国不会为那些撤不走的设施（例如油管、机场、建筑物等）付出任何代价。
