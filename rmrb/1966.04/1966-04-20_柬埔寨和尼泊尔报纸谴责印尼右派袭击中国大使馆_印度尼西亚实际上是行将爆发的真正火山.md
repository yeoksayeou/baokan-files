    According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, 19th, Cambodian newspaper *Motherland* commented on the Indonesian reactionaries' attack on the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta on the 19th, stating, "All observers believe that the currently occurring atrocities against the Chinese Embassy demonstrate that the Indonesian reactionaries are wholeheartedly trying to rely on US imperialism." The commentary stated: This means that Suharto disregards international law and does whatever he pleases; that is his law.
    Cambodian *Telegram*’s editorial on the 18th, when discussing the situation in Indonesia, said that the September 30th Movement was merely an excuse for the Indonesian right-wing elements to conduct a massacre against leftists and free people.
    The editorial pointed out that US imperialism is supporting the Indonesian right-wing forces behind the scenes. The editorial said that Indonesia is actually a real volcano about to erupt. The crimes and mistakes of the Jakarta tricksters will inevitably be repaid with their own blood.
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Kathmandu, 18th, Nepalese newspaper *New Society* published an editorial on the 18th saying: The Indonesian right-wing's destructive actions against the Chinese Embassy, Commercial Counselor's Office, and consulates in Indonesia violate international law and diplomatic norms.
    The editorial stated: Anti-communist elements have not only seized state power but also implemented such an intolerable anti-communist policy, plunging Indonesia into the Western anti-communist group, causing Indonesia's non-aligned and neutral foreign policy to fail.
    The weekly *Public Opinion* recently published a commentary stating: The reactionary military men of Indonesia, under the direction of American intelligence agencies, fearing the development of the Indonesian people's power, planned a military coup. The commentary pointed out, "Indonesia has become a killing field." The commentary pointed out that the Indonesian right-wing propaganda claimed that the Communist Party planned the events of September 30th of last year. In reality, it was the Nasution-led generals' committee, which slavishly followed the United States, that conspired to overthrow President Sukarno's government.
    The commentary said: "Although the reactionaries have succeeded for a time, final victory will definitely and inevitably belong to the Indonesian people."
    The commentary said: The reactionaries' attempt to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party is a pipe dream. The commentary said, "The progressive people will surely win, and the Indonesian reactionaries will surely perish."

    柬埔寨和尼泊尔报纸谴责印尼右派袭击中国大使馆
    印度尼西亚实际上是行将爆发的真正火山
    据新华社金边十九日电　柬埔寨《祖国报》十九日在评论印度尼西亚反动派袭击中国驻雅加达大使馆时说：“所有的观察家都认为，目前所发生的对中国大使馆的暴行，说明印度尼西亚反动派一心要投靠美帝国主义。”评论说：这就是说，苏哈托无视国际法，他爱怎么干就怎么干，这就是他的法律。
    《柬埔寨电讯报》十八日的社论在谈到印度尼西亚局势时说，九月三十日运动对于印度尼西亚右派分子来说，只不过是用来对左派和自由人士进行大屠杀的借口。
    社论指出，美帝国主义在幕后支持印度尼西亚右派势力。社论说，印度尼西亚实际上是一座将要爆发的真正的火山。雅加达的蹩脚的魔术师的罪行和错误必将用他们自己的血来偿还。
    据新华社加德满都十八日电　尼泊尔《新社会报》十八日发表社论说：印度尼西亚右派对中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆、商务参赞处和领事馆采取的破坏行动是违反国际法和外交惯例的。
    社论说：反共分子不仅夺取了国家权力，而且实行这样不可容忍的反共政策，把印度尼西亚投入西方反共集团，使印度尼西亚的不结盟的和中立的外交政策陷于失败。
    《民意》周刊最近发表评论说：印度尼西亚的反动军人在美国情报机关的指使下，由于害怕印度尼西亚人民力量的发展，策划了军事政变。评论指出，“印度尼西亚已经变成了杀人场。”评论指出，印度尼西亚右派宣传共产党策划了去年九月三十日的事件。实际上，是对美国亦步亦趋的纳苏蒂安领导下的将领委员会阴谋推翻苏加诺总统的政府。
    评论说：“虽然反动分子得逞一时，但是最后胜利肯定和必然属于印度尼西亚人民。”
    评论说：反动派企图消灭印度尼西亚共产党，这是白日作梦。评论说，“进步人民一定会胜利，印度尼西亚反动派一定会灭亡。”
