    "Voice of the People of Thailand" Radio Condemns Thanom Clique as Tool of U.S. Imperialist Aggression
    Calls on Patriotic Military and Civilians to Drive Out U.S. Troops and Overthrow Traitorous Government
    Exposes U.S. Aggressor Troops Occupying Strategic Strongholds and Turning Thai Army into Puppet Army
    Xinhua News Agency, 11th -- Bangkok Dispatch: The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station stated in a broadcast on the 8th that the real enemies of the Thai people are U.S. imperialism and its lackey, the Thanom-Praphas clique.
    The radio station said that today's Thai army is, in reality, completely under the control of the United States, becoming a tool for the United States to suppress the patriotic Thai people and invade Southeast Asian countries. The radio station revealed that the U.S. "Military Assistance Command" and "Military Assistance Advisory Group" stationed in Thailand have become combat commands stationed in Thailand, and have merged with the Supreme Command of the Thanom clique's armed forces to establish the so-called "U.S.-Thai Joint Command." In this way, the United States completely controls the Thai army, turning it into a puppet army of the United States, just like the South Vietnamese puppet army. The so-called Supreme Commander of the Thai Armed Forces, Thanom, and Deputy Commander Praphas, are nothing more than servants executing the orders of their American masters.
    The radio station pointed out that due to the Thanom clique's traitorous policies, Thailand's independence and sovereignty have been shattered by the U.S. aggressor troops. It said that important strategic strongholds of the Thai army, originally stationed in Korat, Ubon, Udon, and other places, have now all become U.S. military bases. Sattahip has also been occupied by the United States and expanded into a large military base for invading Southeast Asia.
    The radio station said that the U.S. controls and arms the Thai army, training them to conduct special warfare, with the aim of using the Thai army to invade Indochina and suppress the patriotic movement of the Thai people. According to the U.S. plan to expand the Indochina war, Thai troops have already been sent to Laos in battalions to serve U.S. imperialism, and are being driven to threaten Cambodia. Currently, the U.S. troops stationed in Thailand are directly suppressing patriotic forces in the Northeast, and the U.S. Air Force commando team stationed in Udon Thani recently massacred Thai people around the Udon Air Force Base.
    The radio station pointed out that the U.S. sending troops to occupy Thailand, controlling the Thai army, oppressing and suppressing the Thai people, and driving countless Thai soldiers to Laos to die for it, is completely contrary to the interests of the Thai people.
    The radio station called on patriotic Thai soldiers to stand with all the people, turn their guns around, drive the U.S. aggressors out of Thai territory, overthrow the Thanom-Praphas clique, and strive for genuine independence and democracy for Thailand.
    Xinhua News Agency, 9th -- Bangkok Dispatch: According to a disclosure by the "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station on the 6th, the Thai army is now completely under the strict control and surveillance of U.S. imperialism, and the U.S. aggressors have become the supreme emperors in the Thai barracks.
    The radio station said that in order to control the Thai army, U.S. imperialism has merged the Supreme Command of the Thanom regime's armed forces into the "U.S. Military Assistance Command in Thailand," and established the so-called "U.S.-Thai Joint Command," commanded by Stillwell, the former Chief of Staff of the "Military Assistance Command" in South Vietnam, and directly under the command of the U.S. Armed Forces Command in the Pacific region. Other U.S. military officers in the Supreme Command of the Thai Armed Forces are also there giving orders and arbitrarily issuing commands to Thai officers and soldiers.
    The radio station said that now in various Thai military camps, U.S. aggressor troops are stationed in order to exercise strict control over the Thai army. These aggressor troops regard themselves as supreme emperors in the Thai military camps, often rudely humiliating Thai officers and soldiers.
    The radio station pointed out that the situation of the U.S. aggressor troops riding on the heads of the Thai army, regarding themselves as masters, has aroused increasingly strong dissatisfaction among patriotic Thai officers and soldiers.
    The radio station condemned the Thanom-Praphas clique for assisting evil and participating in the persecution of Thai soldiers by U.S. aggressors. The radio station quoted sources close to military circles as saying that Thai Deputy Prime Minister Praphas, wherever he went for inspection, ordered the monitoring of the activities of officers and soldiers and their families to be stepped up. Letters and various printed materials sent to military camps must also be strictly checked.

    “泰国人民之声”电台谴责他侬集团充当美帝侵略工具
    号召爱国军民赶走美军推翻卖国政府
    揭露美国侵略军占领战略据点把泰国军队变成傀儡军
    新华社十一日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台八日在广播中指出，泰国人民的真正敌人是美帝国主义和它的仆从他侬—巴博集团。
    电台说，今天的泰国军队实际上已经完全在美国的控制下，成为美国镇压泰国爱国人民和侵略东南亚国家的工具。电台揭露说，美国驻在泰国的“军事援助司令部”和“军事援助顾问团”已经变成驻在泰国的作战司令部，并和他侬集团的武装部队最高司令部合并，成立了所谓“美泰联合司令部”。这样美国就完全控制了泰国的军队，使泰国军队成为美国的傀儡军，就象南越傀儡军一样。所谓泰国武装部队最高司令的他侬和副司令巴博，都不过是执行美国主子命令的仆从而已。
    电台指出，由于他侬集团的卖国政策，泰国的独立和主权已被美国侵略军践踏得支离破碎。它说，泰国军队原驻在呵叻、乌汶、乌隆等地的重要战略据点，现已全部成为美国的军事基地。梭桃邑也被美国霸占，并扩建为侵略东南亚的大型军事基地。
    电台说，美国控制和武装泰国军队，训练他们进行特种战争，目的是要利用泰国军队侵略印度支那以及镇压泰国人民的爱国运动。按照美国扩大印度支那战争的计划，泰国军队已经整营地被派到老挝为美帝国主义卖命，并被驱使去威胁柬埔寨。目前，驻在泰国的美军已直接镇压东北部的爱国力量，驻在乌隆府的美国空军突击队，最近就去屠杀过乌隆空军基地周围的泰国人民。
    电台指出，美国派兵占领泰国，控制泰国军队，压迫和镇压泰国人民，驱使无数泰军到老挝为它送死，这完全是同泰国人民的利益相违背的。
    电台号召泰国的爱国军人同全体人民站在一起，掉转枪口，把美国侵略者驱逐出泰国领土，推翻他侬—巴博集团，争取泰国真正的独立和民主。
    新华社九日讯　曼谷消息：据“泰国人民之声”电台六日揭露，泰国军队目前已被完全置于美帝国主义的严密控制和监视之下，美国侵略者已成为泰国兵营中的太上皇。
    电台说，为了控制泰国军队，美帝国主义已把他侬政权的武装部队最高司令部并入“美国驻泰国军事援助司令部”，而成立了所谓“美泰联合司令部”，由美国前任驻南越“军事援助司令部”参谋长史迪威任司令，并直接隶属于美国驻太平洋地区武装部队司令部。在泰国武装部队最高司令部的其他美国军官，也在那里指手划脚，任意向泰国官兵发号施令。
    电台说，现在在泰国各个军营里，都驻有美国侵略军，以便对泰国军队进行严密的控制。这些侵略军在泰国军营中以太上皇自居，经常横蛮地凌辱泰国官兵。
    电台指出，美国侵略军以主子自居骑在泰国军队头上的状况，引起了泰国爱国官兵的日益强烈的不满。
    电台谴责他侬—巴博集团助纣为虐，参与美国侵略者迫害泰国军人的活动。电台援引接近军界人士透露的消息说，泰国副总理巴博每到一处视察，就下令加紧监视官兵和他们的家属的活动。递送到各军营的书信和各种印刷品也要受到严格的检查。
