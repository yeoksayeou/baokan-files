    Holding High the Red Flag to Greet Comrades-in-Arms, Adorning with Lanterns and Decorations to Celebrate Unity
    The People of the Capital Warmly Prepare to Welcome Albanian Brothers
    The people of the capital, in a state of extreme excitement, are preparing to warmly welcome the Albanian Party and Government Delegation headed by Comrade Shehu.

    After the news of the visit to China by the Albanian Party and Government Delegation led by Comrade Shehu was announced, the masses in the capital's factories, schools, government offices, stores, and suburban rural people's communes have been busily making colorful decorations and rehearsing song and dance programs in recent days, preparing to solemnly welcome the envoys of the Albanian people from the front lines of the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. Today, huge portraits of Comrade Shehu have been erected on the main streets of the capital. The Tiananmen gate tower and East and West Chang'an Avenue are adorned with lanterns and decorations, with the national flags of China and Albania fluttering in the gentle breeze, and the entire city is filled with a festive atmosphere.

    The people of the capital hold the heroic Albanian people in high esteem. Workers at the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Plant have rushed to make many bouquets and colorful flags to welcome the distinguished Albanian guests. Wu Zechun, an advanced producer and assembler at the plant, said that the Chinese working class, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supports the world revolution and resolutely opposes American imperialism and modern revisionism. The people of China and Albania will forever fight shoulder to shoulder until the final victory. The workers of Group Five, Class A, of the weaving workshop at the Beijing No. 2 Cotton Textile Factory have maintained close ties with the "November" production team of the Tirana Stalin Textile United Factory for five years. Now, with a fighting friendship toward the fraternal country, they are actively rehearsing songs and dances, preparing to welcome the distinguished guests along the streets. Zhang Zilai, the leader of this group, said: "This extraordinary visit by the Albanian Party and Government Delegation will further promote the great friendship and fighting unity between the two parties and the two peoples of China and Albania, which is based on Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism." After receiving the task of urgently printing a large number of national flags of China and Albania, the workers of Jinghua Printing Factory did everything possible to make the red background color on the flags bright and vivid. They said that the two parties and two peoples of China and Albania resolutely oppose imperialism and revisionism, and this time, the people of the capital must hold high the flags that embody the hearts of the Chinese working class to warmly welcome their close comrades-in-arms.

    When the news of the Albanian distinguished guests' visit to our country reached the rural areas on the outskirts of Beijing, the commune members happily said, "This is a great happy event!" The party branch of Yiduhe Brigade of Beizhai Commune in Huairou County, an advanced agricultural unit famous for learning from Dazhai, immediately convened a general meeting of all commune members after receiving the good news, introducing the Albanian people's revolutionary spirit of thoroughly opposing imperialism and revisionism under the leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour and the brilliant achievements in building socialism. Early in the morning of the 26th, the commune members went up the mountains to cut down green pines and cypresses, preparing to build a decorated archway to symbolize the everlasting friendship between China and Albania. During the midday break, joyful锣鼓 [锣鼓: gongs and drums] sounds came from the brigade's club, where young people were rehearsing literary and artistic programs, preparing to welcome the distinguished guests. The members of the Sino-Albanian Friendship People's Commune, who have close ties with the Albanian people, have been paying special attention to reading newspapers and listening to the radio these days, warmly discussing the Albanian people's struggle to resolutely oppose imperialism and revisionism, and expressing their determination to better learn from their revolutionary experience. Zuo Xiuqin, a commune cadre who had visited Albania, said: "When I heard that Comrade Shehu was coming to visit our country, I was so excited that I didn't know what to say. More than a year ago, the scene of Comrade Hoxha and Comrade Shehu receiving us in Tirana floated before my eyes again. Now, Comrade Shehu is coming to Beijing in person, bringing us tremendous encouragement. We will welcome the distinguished guests with new achievements in agricultural production."

    These days, the campuses of universities and middle schools in Beijing are particularly lively. In the early morning and evening, many students are happily making colorful wreaths and bouquets, rushing to rehearse dances, and practicing singing Albanian songs such as "One Hand Holding a Pick, One Hand Holding a Gun," preparing to welcome the distinguished guests. Many students at the Beijing Institute of Light Industry learned Albanian revolutionary songs from Albanian students at the same school, preparing to welcome the distinguished guests. Teachers, students, and staff of Tsinghua University, who had received Chairman Leshi, were particularly excited. They are using colorful balloons and paper-cuts to build a colorful archway nearly six meters high at the entrance of the guesthouse.

    Literary and art workers in the capital are also rehearsing songs, dances, dramas, and acrobatics with great enthusiasm to welcome the distinguished Albanian guests. They said they would perform the best and most militant programs for their closest comrades-in-arms. (According to Xinhua News Agency) (Attached photo)

    高举红旗迎战友  张灯结彩庆团结
    首都人民热情准备欢迎阿尔巴尼亚兄弟
    首都人民怀着极兴奋的心情，准备热烈迎接以谢胡同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团。
    在谢胡同志率领的阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团访问中国的消息公布后，首都的工厂、学校、机关、商店和郊区农村人民公社的群众，连日来纷纷赶扎彩花，赶排歌舞节目，准备隆重地迎接来自反帝、反修斗争前线的阿尔巴尼亚人民的使者。首都的主要街头，今天已竖起了谢胡同志的巨幅画象。天安门城楼和东西长安街上张灯结彩，中阿两国国旗在和风中迎风招展，整个城市洋溢着节日般的气氛。
    首都人民对英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民怀着崇高的敬意。北京第一机床厂的工人们为迎接阿尔巴尼亚贵宾，赶制了许多花束和彩旗。这个厂的先进生产者、装配工吴泽春说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国工人阶级，坚决支持世界革命，坚决反对美国帝国主义和现代修正主义。中阿两国人民永远肩并肩地战斗到最后胜利。北京第二棉纺织厂织布车间甲班五组的工人，五年来一直和地拉那斯大林纺织联合工厂“十一”生产队保持着亲密的联系。现在，他们怀着对兄弟之邦的战斗友谊，积极排练歌舞，准备夹道欢迎贵宾。这个组的组长张子来说：“阿尔巴尼亚党政代表团这次不平凡的访问，将促使中阿两党、两国人民建立在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的基础上的伟大友谊和战斗团结进一步发展。”京华胶印厂工人们接到赶印大批中、阿两国国旗的任务后，千方百计把旗上的红底色印得鲜艳明亮。他们说，中阿两党、两国人民坚决反帝、反修，这次一定要让首都人民高举着凝结中国工人阶级心意的旗帜去热烈欢迎亲密的战友。
    阿尔巴尼亚贵宾访问我国的消息传到京郊农村，社员们高兴地说，这可是大喜事啊！以学大寨而闻名的农业先进单位——怀柔县北宅公社一渡河大队党支部，在喜讯传到后立即召开全体社员大会，介绍阿尔巴尼亚人民在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，彻底反帝反修的革命精神和建设社会主义的光辉成就。二十六日一清早，社员们上山砍来苍松翠柏，准备搭一座牌楼，象征中阿情谊万古长青。中午休息时，大队俱乐部传出欢乐的锣鼓声，青年们正在排练文艺节目，准备欢迎贵宾。和阿尔巴尼亚人民有着亲密往来的中阿友好人民公社社员，这几天特别注意读报、听广播，热烈谈论阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决反帝反修的斗争情况，表示要更好地学习他们的革命经验。曾经访问过阿尔巴尼亚的公社干部左秀琴说：“当我听说谢胡同志要到我们国家来访问，激动得不知说什么才好。一年多以前，霍查和谢胡同志在地拉那接见我们的情景又浮现在眼前，现在谢胡同志要亲自来到北京，给我们带来了巨大的鼓舞，我们将以农业生产的新成就欢迎贵宾。”
    这几天，北京大、中学校的校园里特别热闹。清晨和傍晚，许多学生在兴高采烈地扎制彩色花环和花束，赶排舞蹈，练唱《一手拿镐，一手拿枪》等阿尔巴尼亚歌曲，准备欢迎贵宾。北京轻工业学院的许多学生，向同校的阿尔巴尼亚留学生学习了阿尔巴尼亚革命歌曲，准备去欢迎贵宾。曾经接待过列希主席的清华大学师生员工们，情绪格外振奋。他们正在用五色缤纷的气球和剪纸，在迎宾馆的大门口搭起一座近六米高的彩色牌楼。
    首都文艺工作者也在满怀热情地为欢迎阿尔巴尼亚贵宾排练歌曲、舞蹈、戏剧和杂技，他们表示要为最亲密的战友演出最好、最富有战斗性的节目。（据新华社讯）（附图片）
