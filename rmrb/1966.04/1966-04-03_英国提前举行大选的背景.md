Title: Background to Britain's Early General Election

    The British general election was held on March 31st. As predicted by some of the British bourgeois newspapers beforehand, the ruling Labour Party won a victory with a certain advantage in the 630 parliamentary seats in the House of Commons election.
    This general election was announced by British Prime Minister Wilson at the end of February. The British Parliament is normally re-elected every five years. After the re-election, the party that wins the majority of seats forms a new cabinet. However, according to British electoral system regulations, the ruling party can, within its five-year term, dissolve Parliament early and hold a general election at any time, based on changes in the political situation and its own interests. Wilson's decision to hold an early general election this time was precisely to seize the opportunity and try to improve the Labour government's precarious situation before the domestic political and economic situation in Britain further deteriorated.
    Since the Wilson government came to power in October 1964, it has been in a precarious state. It had only a "hair's breadth" majority of three seats in the 630 parliamentary seats in the House of Commons. It yielded to the United States in foreign affairs and caused heavy financial and economic difficulties at home, which had long made it very unpopular. In this situation, the Labour government could be defeated in the House of Commons at any time when it put forward some controversial important bills, due to opposition from individual members of its own party, thereby leading to its own downfall.
    However, why was the Wilson government, eager to get rid of this unstable position, determined to hold a general election before the end of March?
    One of the reasons is the current weakness of the Conservative Party. As everyone knows, since the Conservative Party lost the election in October 1964, internal contradictions have been very acute. Heath, the new leader who succeeded former party leader Home last autumn, has not yet gained a firm foothold within the party and established sufficient prestige. At the same time, compared with the Labour Party, the Conservative Party, which has been in power for thirteen years, is even more unpopular. This made Wilson feel that there was an opportunity to take advantage of.
    Another important factor in the Labour government's decision to act quickly is the bleak prospects for the British domestic economy. The Wilson government has racked its brains to rescue the pound for a year and a half. However, at present, whether it is Britain's international trade balance, the worsening trend of inflation, or the rate of economic development, they all herald a very gloomy prospect. This forced the Labour government to decide to put forward a very unpopular austerity budget in mid-April that would require the British people to tighten their belts further and stop increasing wages, in order to stabilize the pound and prevent the deterioration of the international balance of payments. With the introduction of this budget and the accelerated deterioration of the British economic situation, the opposition to the Labour Party will inevitably increase greatly. In order to avoid this unfavorable situation, the Wilson government decided to take the lead in holding a general election before the end of March.
    Both the Labour Party and the Conservative Party are tools of the British monopoly bourgeoisie. It can be seen from their past election platforms that they have absolutely no differences on major policies. The Labour Party has always been a "firm supporter" of the North Atlantic Group headed by the United States. The Conservative Party wants to "contribute" to this military group. The Labour Party "welcomes" the American "peace talks" fraud regarding Vietnam, while the Conservative Party says it will be committed to "stopping hostilities in the Far East." The Labour Party emphasizes that Britain has "global responsibilities" "east of Suez," while the Conservative Party wants to "fulfill treaty obligations in the Middle East and the Far East." The Labour Party wants to implement a "income policy" that restricts wages, while the Conservative Party advocates even more the control of trade unions and the restriction of strikes. In this situation, British voters are simply choosing between two devils. No wonder that in this election performance, despite the fanfare and boasting on both sides, the broad masses of the British people are very indifferent to it. Even the *New York Times* called this election a "dull campaign." The Labour Party's victory in this election is just an old trick played by British monopoly capital, which does not reflect "public opinion" at all, nor can it improve the miserable situation of the new Labour government in any way.

### 英国提前举行大选的背景

    英国提前举行大选的背景
    英国在三月三十一日举行了大选。竞选结果，正象英国一部分资产阶级报刊事先所预料的，执政的工党在下院六百三十个议员席位竞选中以一定优势取得胜利。
    这次大选是由英国首相威尔逊二月底宣布举行的。英国议会本来是五年改选一次。改选后，由取得多数席位的政党组成新的内阁。但是，根据英国选举制度规定，执政党可以在它的五年任期内，根据政局变化和自身的利害考虑，随时宣布提前解散议会和举行大选。这次威尔逊之所以决定提前举行大选，正是想抓住时机，赶在英国国内政治、经济情况进一步恶化以前，力求改善一下工党政府的险恶处境。
    威尔逊政府从一九六四年十月上台以来，一直处于风雨飘摇状态。它在下院六百三十个议员席位中，只有“头发丝一样细”的微弱的三席多数。它在外交上屈从美国，在国内弄得财政经济困难重重，早就十分不得人心。在这种情况下，工党政府随时可能在提出一些有争论的重要法案时，因受本党个别议员的反对，而在下院被否决，由此导致自己的垮台。
    可是，急于摆脱这一不稳定地位的威尔逊政府，又为什么要决定在三月底之前举行大选呢？
    原因之一，就是保守党目前的软弱处境。大家知道，从一九六四年十月保守党竞选失败以来，党内矛盾十分尖锐。去年秋天接替前党魁霍姆的新领袖希思，至今没有在党内站稳脚跟，并树立足够的威信。同时，和工党相比，执政十三年的保守党是更加不得人心。这就使威尔逊感到有机可乘。
    工党政府决定迅速采取行动的另一个重要因素，是英国国内经济前景不妙。威尔逊政府为一年半以来抢救英镑曾绞尽了脑汁。但是，目前无论是英国的国际贸易收支状况、通货膨胀恶化趋势或经济发展速度，都预示了十分阴暗的前景。这使工党政府在稳定英镑，防止国际收支恶化方面，不得不决定在四月中提出一个要英国人民进一步勒紧腰带和制止增加工资的十分不得人心的紧缩预算。随着这一预算的提出和英国经济情况的加速恶化，工党遭到的反对，势必大大增加。为了避免这一不利情况，威尔逊政府便决定抢先在三月底以前举行大选。
    工党和保守党都是英国垄断资产阶级的工具。从它们历次的竞选纲领中可以看出，它们在重大政策上完全没有区别。工党一向是“坚决支持”以美国为首的北大西洋集团的。保守党则要为这个军事集团
  “作出贡献”。工党“欢迎”美国关于越南的“和谈”骗局，保守党则表示要致力于“停止远东的敌对行动”。工党强调英国在“苏伊士以东”有“世界性责任”，保守党则要“履行中东、远东的条约义务”。工党要执行限制工资的“收入政策”，而保守党更是主张控制工会，限制罢工。在这种情况下，英国的选民不过是在两个魔鬼之间进行选择罢了。难怪在这次竞选表演中，尽管双方锣鼓喧天，大吹大擂，英国广大人民却对之十分冷淡。连《纽约时报》都把这次大选称作是“沉闷的竞选”。工党这次竞选的胜利，不过是英国垄断资本玩腻了的老把戏，根本不反映什么“民意”，也不可能使新的工党政府的可悲处境得到任何改善。
