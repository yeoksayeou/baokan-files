    Sato Government's New Provocation to the Chinese and Japanese People
    By Our Staff Commentator

    On March 29th, the Sato government of Japan flagrantly refused entry to the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. Following this, it continued to slander and attack China. This is an extremely serious step by the Sato government to deliberately sabotage friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese people, and is yet another blatant exposure of its reactionary face of hostility towards the Chinese people and its following of US imperialism. The Chinese people must not take this lightly.

    Strengthening friendly exchanges between the people is the common aspiration of the Chinese and Japanese people. Over the past several years, thanks to the joint efforts of the Chinese and Japanese people and people from all walks of life in Japan, exchanges of personnel, culture and economy between the two countries have developed. The Japanese Socialist Party delegation has visited China four times at the invitation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, contributing to promoting mutual understanding and friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. Now, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs is sending a delegation to visit Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Socialist Party, which is a reciprocal gesture, to promote friendship between the two peoples and the cause of Asian unity against imperialism, and is a welcome thing.

    Why does the Sato government try so hard to oppose and obstruct such reasonable and completely legitimate things? This is by no means accidental.

    The Sato government's actions on Sino-Japanese relations since coming to power are a shameful record of undermining friendly exchanges between the two peoples. It has tried every means to undermine trade exchanges between China and Japan. It rudely refused entry to the Chinese Communist Party delegation headed by Comrade Peng Zhen. It has repeatedly sabotaged and obstructed the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival. Now, it has unreasonably refused entry to the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs. All this fully proves that the Sato government's repeated claims of "friendly coexistence" between China and Japan, and "looking forward" on the China issue, are completely deceptive nonsense.

    The Sato government says that the entry of the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs would "interfere in Japan's internal affairs." This is simply absurd. Since the Sato government has raised this issue, we need to settle accounts with it. It is precisely the Japanese reactionaries who are unscrupulously interfering in China's internal affairs and even ambitiously coveting Chinese territory. It is the Sato government that maintains so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang overthrown by the Chinese people. It is also the Sato government that openly opposes the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations and plots the "two Chinas" conspiracy. It is still the Sato government that advocates the so-called "undetermined status of Taiwan," attempting to get its hands on China's Taiwan Province. The Sato government should remember that the Japanese reactionaries' debt to the Chinese people will be settled sooner or later.

    Recently, the Sato government's anti-China arrogance has been extremely rampant, posing as if it wants to compete with the Chinese people. It is full of energy, willing to act as an accomplice and henchman of US imperialism in encircling and "containing" China. At home, it is stepping up the revival of Japanese militarism, vigorously expanding its military strength and preparing for war, and formulating secret military plans to attack China. Abroad, it is stepping up collusion with Khrushchev revisionists, Indian reactionaries, and all other reactionary and decadent forces hostile to China, doing its utmost to help the United States put together an anti-China united front. It even blatantly clamors that the scope of application of the Japan-US "security treaty" includes China, Vietnam, and Korea, and threatens to send troops abroad. The Sato government regards China as its main enemy because, in the eyes of the Japanese reactionaries, the People's Republic of China, which has stood up and resolutely supports the anti-imperialist struggles of the people of Asian countries, is the biggest obstacle to their reconstruction of the colonial hegemony of the 1930s in Asia. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Sato government has adopted a series of reactionary policies hostile to the Chinese people.

    All this irrefutably proves that the Sato cabinet is a fanatically anti-China cabinet, a cabinet that is stepping up the revival of militarism and expanding and aggressing abroad, and a cabinet that is wholeheartedly led by the United States by the nose. If the Sato government slides down this road, it will inevitably drag the Japanese nation into the abyss of disaster again.

    The reactionary policies pursued by the Sato government run counter to the interests of the Japanese nation. The Japanese people will never allow a handful of reactionaries to act perversely. The broad masses of the Japanese people and people from all walks of life demand friendship with China. It is only the Sato government that is undermining the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people. This time, the Sato government's unreasonable refusal to allow the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to enter the country has aroused strong protests and condemnations from the broad masses of the Japanese people and public opinion. The Japanese Socialist Party's statement pointed out: This "not only nakedly exposes the Sato cabinet's hostile attitude towards China, but also exposes its humiliating diplomatic posture of succumbing to the pressure of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan." Iwama Masao, deputy head of the Japanese Communist Party Diet Members Group, pointed out that the Sato government's measure is a "provocation to the broad masses of the Japanese people." Japanese famous commentator Nakajima Kenzo pointed out: "This is not only an attack on the Socialist Party, but also an attack on the entire Japanese people." The Japanese reactionaries' deliberate attempt to worsen Sino-Japanese relations can only further expose their reactionary faces among the Japanese people. It is not the Japanese reactionaries who determine the fate of Japan, but the Japanese people. Sato Eisaku and his ilk want to obstruct and undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, but they are simply overestimating their own abilities.

    We sternly warn the Sato government: The 650 million Chinese people cannot be insulted. Your predecessor, Tojo Hideki, opposed China for many years, and as a result, he was sent to the grave. If you want to persist in opposing China to the end, what other outcome can there be besides suffering the same fate?

    佐藤政府向中日两国人民的新挑衅
    本报评论员
    三月二十九日，日本佐藤政府悍然拒绝我国人民外交学会代表团入境。在这之后，它又继续对中国进行诬蔑和攻击。这是佐藤政府蓄意破坏中日两国人民友好往来的极其严重的步骤，是它敌视中国人民、追随美帝国主义的反动面目的又一次大暴露。中国人民对此绝不能等闲视之。
    加强人民间的友好往来，是中日两国人民的共同愿望。过去若干年来，由于中日两国人民和日本各界人士的共同努力，两国间的人员往来、文化经济的交流，有了发展。日本社会党代表团应中国人民外交学会的邀请，四次访问中国，对促进中日两国人民的相互了解和友谊，作出了贡献。现在，中国人民外交学会应日本社会党的邀请，派代表团访问日本，是一种礼尚往来，是为了促进两国人民的友好和亚洲团结反帝的事业，是一件值得欢迎的事情。
    对于这样合情合理的和完全正当的事情，为什么佐藤政府拼命地要加以反对和阻挠呢？这决不是偶然的。
    佐藤政府上台以来在中日关系上的所作所为，是一部破坏两国人民友好往来的可耻记录。它千方百计地破坏中日之间的贸易往来。它粗暴地拒绝以彭真同志为首的中国共产党代表团入境。它百般破坏和阻挠中日青年友好大联欢。现在，它又无理地拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境。这一切充分证明：佐藤政府一再标榜的什么中日两国要“友好相处”，什么在对华问题上要“向前看”，完全是彻头彻尾的骗人的鬼话。
    佐藤政府说什么中国人民外交学会代表团的入境，会“干涉日本内政”。这简直是荒谬绝伦。佐藤政府既然提到了这个问题，我们就有必要同它算一笔账。正是日本反动派，对中国内政进行肆无忌惮的干预，甚至野心勃勃地觊觎中国领土。同被中国人民推翻了的蒋介石匪帮保持所谓“外交关系”的，是佐藤政府。公然反对恢复中国在联合国的合法权利、策划“两个中国”阴谋的，也是佐藤政府。鼓吹所谓“台湾归属未定”论，妄图染指我国台湾省的，还是佐藤政府。佐藤政府应该记住：日本反动派对中国人民欠下的这笔账，是迟早要清算的。
    最近以来，佐藤政府的反华气焰十分嚣张，摆出一副要同中国人民较量一番的架势。它劲头十足，甘心充当美帝国主义包围和“遏制”中国的帮凶和打手。在国内，它加紧复活日本军国主义，大肆扩军备战，制订进攻中国的秘密军事计划。在国外，它加紧串连赫鲁晓夫修正主义者、印度反动派和其他一切敌视中国的反动腐朽势力，为美国拼凑一个反华联合阵线，竭尽犬马之劳。它甚至明目张胆地叫嚣日美“安全条约”适用范围包括中国、越南、朝鲜，扬言要派兵出国。佐藤政府所以把中国当作它的主要敌人，是因为在日本反动派看来，站了起来的、坚决支持亚洲各国人民反帝斗争的中华人民共和国，是它们在亚洲重建三十年代殖民霸业的最大障碍。因此，佐藤政府采取敌视中国人民的一系列反动政策，就不足为怪了。
    这一切无可辩驳地证明，佐藤内阁是一个疯狂反华的内阁，是一个加紧复活军国主义、向外扩张和侵略的内阁，是一个死心塌地让美国牵着鼻子走的内阁。佐藤政府沿着这条道路滑下去，必然要再次把日本民族拖入灾难的深渊。
    佐藤政府所奉行的反动政策，是同日本民族的利益背道而驰的。日本人民决不会允许一小撮反动派这样倒行逆施。日本广大人民和各界人士是要求同中国友好的。破坏日中两国人民友谊的，只是佐藤政府。这一次，佐藤政府无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境，已经激起了日本广大人民和公众舆论的强烈抗议和谴责。日本社会党的声明指出：这“不但赤裸裸地暴露了佐藤内阁敌视中国的态度，而且暴露了它屈服于美帝国主义和台湾蒋介石集团的压力的屈辱外交的姿态”。日本共产党国会议员团副团长岩间正男指出，佐藤政府的这一措施是对“广大日本人民的挑衅。”日本著名评论家中岛健藏指出：“这不仅是对社会党的进攻，而且是对全体日本人民的进攻”。日本反动派蓄意恶化中日关系，只能在日本人民中进一步暴露它们的反动面目。决定日本命运的，不是日本反动派，而是日本人民。佐藤荣作之流想阻挠和破坏中日两国人民的友谊，不过是螳臂当车。
    我们正告佐藤政府：六亿五千万中国人民是不可侮的。你们的先辈东条英机，反华反了好多年，结果是被送进了坟墓。你们如果要坚持反华到底，除了落个同样的下场以外，还能有什么别的结果呢？
