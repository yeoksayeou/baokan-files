　　Xinhua News Agency, April 22nd – Rochado, leader of the Cambodian Journalists Delegation, stated on April 21st at the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association that peace will never be lasting and the independence of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries will remain threatened until the most savage and aggressive U.S. imperialism is eliminated from all continents.

　　Rochado severely condemned the U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, as well as their propaganda machines, for their attacks and slanders against the people of Asia and Africa. He pointed out that these enemies must be treated "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," and, when necessary, "we should fight back like the South Vietnamese people with a patriotic people's war, which is a form of struggle that no army of any imperialism in the world can ever defeat."

　　Rochado also emphasized that "Cambodia's rejection of U.S. aid and severance of all relations with the United States has not only not harmed our country, but has, on the contrary, benefited it." He said that this proves that all Asian, African, and Latin American countries can live without U.S. aid and can manage without maintaining relations with the United States.

　　In his speech, Rochado pointed out that today, the people of the whole world, especially the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, are developing and strengthening their struggles and have achieved such great success that imperialism and neo-colonialism—mainly their head, U.S. imperialism—are forced to take desperate actions, and therefore, the most sinful, most barbaric, and most crazy actions, in an attempt to prolong their existence for a period. They are now trying to enforce the law of the jungle; they are playing the trick of the thief crying "stop thief"; they are trying to forcibly impose white supremacy on "people of color" based on the most despicable racist philosophy; they have even surpassed their spiritual master, the Nazis, in using poison gas and bacteriological weapons against the Vietnamese people who dare to resist them. But by doing so, they only expose themselves as enemies of all mankind; they will only suffer heavier blows from the people of all countries who love freedom, justice, and peace; and they will only accelerate their own doomsday.

　　He said that Khmer journalists are convinced that as long as imperialism and neo-colonialism, especially the most arrogant, most aggressive, richest, and most powerful imperialism, namely U.S. imperialism, has not been eliminated from our continents, peace will never be lasting, the independence of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries will remain threatened, and our efforts to build our countries will remain subject to all kinds of conspiracies.

　　He stated that although the Cambodian people firmly pursue a policy of peace, independence, neutrality, and progress, in recent years, Cambodia has constantly been the object of various subversive activities, pressures, tricks, conspiracies, threats, and acts of aggression plotted by U.S. imperialists and their Thai and South Vietnamese running dogs in Bangkok and Saigon. The American psychological warfare machine, American intelligence organizations, and the American government have exhausted all means in an attempt to force our country to abandon the correct path it has chosen for itself. Especially due to the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people, who are causing increasingly heavy defeats to the U.S.-puppet troops, Thailand has become the main agent of imperialist conspiracies against Cambodia. Currently, Thailand is carrying out the most serious aggression against Cambodia. Thai troops have repeatedly invaded Khmer territory, and each invasion has involved killings and plundering. This is a prelude to a large-scale invasion of Cambodia! There is no doubt whatsoever that the plan of the U.S. imperialists is to expand the war to the entire Indochina and China!

　　Rochado emphasized that despite the seeming power of U.S. imperialism and its Saigon and Bangkok running dogs, the Cambodian people have not been, and never will be, intimidated! When the so-called American "aid" proved to be a means of political oppression and blackmail, a source of corruption, and an economic shackle, we resolutely, completely, and thoroughly rejected this "aid." When the Washington government openly opposed our country, we severed all relations with it. Just as the aggression by the puppet armies of Saigon and Bangkok, hired by the United States, clearly has a definite expansionist intention, we have determined that our policy is one of retaliation, namely "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth." If our enemies continue to carry out regional attacks, we will respond with the same regional counterattacks. If our enemies are determined to invade us, then we will fight back like the South Vietnamese people with a patriotic people's war, which is a form of struggle that no army of any imperialism in the world can ever defeat.

　　He said that the Cambodian people declare that they support all struggles against imperialism, neo-colonialism, and especially against U.S. imperialism. The Cambodian people believe that South Vietnam should belong to the Vietnamese people, Laos should belong entirely to the Lao people, Thailand belongs to the Thai people, Taiwan belongs to China, South Korea belongs to the Korean people, Indonesia belongs to the Indonesian people, Ghana belongs to the Ghanaian people, Zimbabwe belongs to the Zimbabwean people, Azania belongs to the Azanian people... In short, Asia belongs to Asians, Africa belongs to Africans, and Latin America belongs to Latin Americans!

　　He said, here I would like to emphasize that Cambodia's rejection of U.S. aid and severance of all relations with the United States has not only not harmed our country, but has, on the contrary, benefited it. In fact, more than two years after our rejection of U.S. aid, it is absolutely undeniable that our economic situation is good, our currency is stable, and our army has not lost anything except the humiliation of being dependent on the American military delegation in many respects in the past. There is a fact that will convince even the most skeptical: In the past, when relying on American aid, our foreign trade has always been in deficit. In 1964, we rejected American aid, and for the first time, our trade showed a surplus. In 1965, there was another surplus of 721,178,200 riel.

　　He emphasized that Cambodia, which has achieved this success without the so-called American aid, is a country lacking special natural resources. There is neither oil nor gold, neither diamonds nor silver, neither uranium nor copper, neither tin nor coal in our underground. Our possibility of surviving alone without U.S. aid was so small that the disgruntled American diplomats who had served in Phnom Penh and were asked to return to Washington did not hesitate to gloat and predict that in at most three months, we would kneel on the ground and beg them to come back! But you know clearly that two years have passed, and have greatly passed, and we have not knelt down to beg these American diplomats to come back. What does this prove? This proves that all Asian, African, and Latin American countries can live without U.S. aid, and all Asian, African, and Latin American countries can manage without maintaining relations with the United States.

　　Rochado then exposed the lies and propaganda of imperialism, which, through very large means, carried out all kinds of slander against "little Cambodia" which dared to reject American aid and sever relations with the United States; they slandered Cambodia as being unable to straighten its back under "Sihanouk's dictatorship," slandered it as "a satellite of Red China," "an accomplice of the Viet Cong," "a haven for the Viet Cong," "a transit station for Viet Cong personnel and equipment," "a constant threat to peaceful and small Thailand," etc. He said, isn't this slander campaign part of the plan to expand the war to our country? Knowing the danger that this movement implies, we resolutely retaliated against it. Our Asian and African press brothers have given us strong assistance. Imperialists and their "great" news tools deny our achievements and our progress, because these achievements and progress shatter the image of a Cambodia that they have so carefully manufactured, a Cambodia that should be "liberated" according to their way.

　　He called on the progressive journalists of the world, especially the journalists of Asia and Africa, to coordinate their efforts, and must aim their pens at the common enemies of the people of all countries: imperialism and neo-colonialism, especially U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

　　He stated that under these circumstances, we can only fully support the decision of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association to withdraw from Jakarta, because the situation in Indonesia no longer allows for beneficial work for the anti-imperialist struggle. He said that in the hearts of all our people, anti-imperialist journalism is very important. Please allow me to assure you, to assure the Asian-African Journalists Association again, that the journalists and people of Cambodia will give full and complete support.

### 柬埔寨新闻工作者代表团团长罗杰多的发言  亚非新闻工作者必须把笔锋对准美帝

    柬埔寨新闻工作者代表团团长罗杰多的发言
    亚非新闻工作者必须把笔锋对准美帝
    新华社二十二日讯　柬埔寨新闻工作者代表团团长罗杰多二十一日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议
  （扩大）上发言时指出，在没有把最野蛮、最富侵略性的美帝国主义从各大陆上消灭掉以前，和平将是永远不持久的，亚非拉各国人民的独立就仍将受到威胁。
    罗杰多严厉谴责了美帝国主义及其走狗和它们的宣传机器对亚非人民的进攻和诽谤。他指出，对待这些敌人要“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”，必要时“我们就象南越人民那样以爱国的人民战争，即是以世界上任何帝国主义的军队永远不能战胜的斗争形式来回击他们”。
    罗杰多还强调指出，“柬埔寨拒绝美援和断绝同美国的一切关系，不但没有给我国带来害处，相反地有利于我国”。他说，这证明所有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家没有美援也能过活，不同美国保持关系也能过得下去。
    罗杰多在讲话中指出，今天，全世界人民，特别是亚非拉美人民正在发展和加强他们的斗争，并且取得了如此巨大的成功，以致帝国主义和新老殖民主义——主要是它们的头子美帝国主义——被迫采取了绝望挣扎的行动，因而是最罪恶的、最野蛮的、最疯狂的行动，企图再苟延残喘一个时期。他们现在企图使弱肉强食的法律生效，他们玩弄了贼喊捉贼的手法，他们企图根据最卑鄙的种族主义哲学对“有色人”强行实行白人霸权，他们甚至超过了他们的精神主子纳粹分子的做法，使用了毒气、细菌武器来对付敢于抵抗他们的越南人民。可是他们这样做只不过暴露他们是全人类的敌人的面目，他们只会遭到爱好自由、正义与和平的各国人民更为沉重的打击，他们只会加速他们自己的末日早日到来。
    他说，高棉的记者们确信，只要还没有把帝国主义和新老殖民主义，特别是没有把最蛮横、最富侵略性，最富有和最强大的帝国主义，即美帝国主义从我们的各大陆上消灭掉，和平将是永远不持久的，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民的独立就仍将受到威胁，我们建设国家的努力就仍将遭到种种阴谋的陷害。
    他谈到，虽然柬埔寨人民坚决地奉行和平、独立、中立和进步的政策，但最近这些年间，柬埔寨不断地成为美帝国主义者及他们的曼谷和西贡的泰国和南越走狗策划的种种颠覆行动、压力、诡计、阴谋、威胁和侵略行动的对象。美国的心理战机器，美国的特务组织和美国政府用尽了一切手段，竭力迫使我国放弃它为自己选择的正确道路。特别由于目前越南人民的英勇斗争，越南人民使美伪军队日益遭到惨重的失败，泰国就成为反对柬埔寨的帝国主义阴谋的主要代理人。目前，泰国对柬埔寨进行着最为严重的侵略。泰国军队接二连三地入侵高棉领土，而每次入侵都进行了杀害和掠夺。这是对柬埔寨进行大规模侵略的前奏！丝毫不容置疑的是，美帝国主义者的计划是要把战争扩大到整个印度支那和中国！
    罗杰多强调说，尽管美帝国主义及其西贡和曼谷的走狗貌似强大，但是柬埔寨人民过去没有、将来也永远不会被吓倒！当所谓的美国“援助”表明了是政治压迫和讹诈的手段，是腐败的根源和经济上的桎梏，我们就坚决、完全、彻底地拒绝了这种“援助”。当华盛顿政府赤裸裸地同我们国家作对，我们同它断绝了一切关系。正当由美国雇用的西贡和曼谷傀儡军队的侵略显然具有一种既定的扩张主义意图时，我们确定我们的政策是进行报复的政策，即“以眼还眼，以牙还牙”。如果我们的敌人继续进行区域性攻击，我们将以同样的区域性反攻回击他们。如果我们的敌人决心要侵犯我们，那么，我们就象南越人民那样以爱国的人民战争，即是以世界上任何帝国主义的军队永远不能战胜的斗争形式来回击他们。
    他说，柬埔寨人民宣布，他们支持反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义、特别是反对美帝国主义的一切斗争。柬埔寨人民认为，南越应该属于越南人民，老挝完全属于老挝人民，泰国属于泰国人民，台湾属于中国，南朝鲜属于朝鲜人民，印度尼西亚属于印度尼西亚人民，加纳属于加纳人民，津巴布韦属于津巴布韦人民，阿扎尼亚属于阿扎尼亚人民……总之，亚洲属于亚洲人，非洲属于非洲人，拉丁美洲属于拉丁美洲人！
    他说，在这里我想强调指出的是，柬埔寨拒绝美援和断绝同美国的一切关系，这不但没有给我国带来害处，相反地有利于我国。事实上，在我们拒绝美援两年多的今天，绝对无可置疑的是，我国的经济情况是良好的，我国的货币是稳定的，我国的军队除了丧失过去在很多方面依赖美国军事代表团的那种屈辱外，没有丧失任何东西。有一个事实会使最多疑的人信服：过去靠美国援助时，我们的对外贸易一直是逆差。一九六四年我们拒绝了美援，我们的贸易第一次出现了顺差。一九六五年，再次盈余七亿二千一百七十八万二千瑞尔。
    他强调指出，在没有美国的所谓援助的情况下取得了这种成就的柬埔寨，是一个缺乏特殊的天然资源的国家。在我国的地下既没有石油也没有黄金，既没有钻石也没有白银，既没有铀也没有铜，既没有锡也没有煤。我们没有美援而独自生存下去的可能性如此之小，以致曾在金边任职的、被我们请求回华盛顿而心怀不满的美国外交官们，毫不犹豫地幸灾乐祸地预言说，顶多三个月以后，我们将跪在地上哀求他们回来！但是你们清楚地知道，两年已经过去了，并且是大大地过去了，我们并没有跪下来哀求这些美国外交官回来。这证明了什么呢？这证明了所有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的国家没有美援也能过活，所有亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲国家不同美国保持关系也能过得下去。
    罗杰多接着揭露了帝国主义的谎言宣传通过十分庞大的手段，对胆敢拒绝美国援助和同美国断交的“小小的柬埔寨”所进行的种种诬蔑，它们诽谤柬埔寨在“西哈努克的独裁统治”下压得直不起腰，诽谤它是“赤色中国的卫星国”，“越共的帮凶”，“越共的避难所”，“越共的人员和装备的过境站”，“是对和平与弱小的泰国的经常性威胁”，等等。他说，这一诽谤运动难道不是旨在把战争扩大到我国的计划的组成部分吗？由于我们知道这一运动所意味着的危险，我们坚决地给予这种运动以还击。我们的亚洲和非洲的报界兄弟曾经给予我们强有力的援助。帝国主义者和他们的“伟大的”新闻工具否认我们的成就和我们的进步，因为这些成就和进步粉碎了他们如此精心制造的、应按照他们的方式“解放”的一个柬埔寨的形象。
    他呼吁世界的进步新闻工作者，特别是亚洲和非洲的新闻工作者必须协调他们的努力，必须把他们的笔锋对准各国人民的共同敌人：帝国主义和新老殖民主义，特别是美帝国主义和它的走狗。
    他表示，在这种情况下，我们只能全力支持亚非新闻工作者协会书记处撤离雅加达的决定，因为印度尼西亚的局势，已不再容许为反帝斗争从事有益的工作。他说，在我们全国人民的心眼中，反帝的新闻工作是非常重要的。请允许我向你们保证，向亚非新闻工作者协会再次保证，柬埔寨的新闻工作者们和柬埔寨人民将给予充分和完全的支持。
