    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, March 31st. The Sato government, which consistently follows the United States in its anti-China policy, outrageously and unreasonably rejected the entry of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation on the 29th, which was scheduled to pay a friendly visit to Japan recently at the invitation of the Japanese Socialist Party. This unreasonable decision immediately aroused strong protests from more than 50 Japanese political parties and mass organizations, as well as severe condemnation from broad public opinion.
    It is reported that the Socialist Party established a welcoming committee on the 23rd, composed of Chairman Sasaki and the party's Central Executive Committee, and submitted an application to the Sato government for approval of the entry of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation. However, under the instruction of Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Sato, Chief Cabinet Secretary (Secretary-General) Tomisaburo Hashimoto, Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina, and Justice Minister Mitsujiro Ishii made the unreasonable decision on the 29th to reject the entry of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation.
    When meeting with Japanese reporters on the evening of the 29th, Tomisaburo Hashimoto sophistically defended the Sato government's anti-China actions that obstruct and undermine friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and Japan. He babbled that "considering the current international and domestic situation, allowing the Chinese delegation to enter the country at this time would harm (Japan's) national interests" and would "interfere in Japan's internal affairs." Justice Minister Mitsujiro Ishii spoke even more bluntly. He regarded protecting the American master as Japan's "national interest." He said: "It is unacceptable to criticize the United States, which maintains friendly relations with Japan."
    The Sato government's decision is a continuation and development of its anti-China policy. The Sato government has been blatantly following the United States in pursuing the reactionary policy of "two Chinas" and hostility towards China. Shortly after Eisaku Sato came to power in the autumn of 1964, he unreasonably refused the entry of the Chinese Communist Party delegation headed by Peng Zhen to Japan to attend the Ninth Congress of the Japanese Communist Party. Subsequently, he used the so-called "Yoshida Letter" to undermine Sino-Japanese trade, and tried every means to sabotage and obstruct the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally, and frantically obstructed the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations General Assembly. Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina even attacked the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally on the Budget Committee of the Senate on March 28, rambling that Japanese youth coming to China to participate in the rally was also "a serious interference in Japan's internal affairs."
    The Japanese Socialist Party issued a statement on the 29th, strongly protesting the Sato government's unreasonable decision. The statement pointed out: "No one can deny that mutual exchanges will enhance Japan-China friendship, thereby contributing to peace in Asia." The statement said: "The (Sato) government has trampled on the hopes and expectations of the people and illegally and unreasonably rejected the entry of the (Chinese) delegation. This not only nakedly exposes the Sato Cabinet's hostile attitude towards China but also reveals its humiliating diplomatic posture of succumbing to the pressure of US imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. This incident shows that the Sato government is following the United States and cooperating with it in an attempt to intensify the war of aggression against Vietnam."
    Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, Sasaki Kozo, issued a statement on the 30th, pointing out that the Sato government's blatant refusal of the entry of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation is a challenge to the Japanese people and the Asian people. Sasaki stated that the Socialist Party will fight to the end to ensure that the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation can visit Japan.
    Iwama Masao, Deputy Leader of the Japanese Communist Party Parliamentary Group, issued a statement on the evening of the 29th, exposing the Sato government's constant interference in China's internal affairs and refuting the Sato government's fallacious arguments that the Chinese delegation was "interfering in Japan's internal affairs" and "endangering national interests." Iwama pointed out that the Sato government's refusal of the entry of the Chinese Communist Party delegation headed by Peng Zhen and the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation has created serious obstacles to the future development of Sino-Japanese relations. This is a new manifestation of the Sato government's increasing participation in the US aggression against Vietnam and "containment" of China. Iwama said: "The Sato government's unreasonable and illegal attack on the Chinese delegation is a provocation against the broad masses of Japanese people who are striving for independence, peace, democracy, and demanding Japan-China friendship and the early restoration of diplomatic relations between the two countries. The Japanese people absolutely cannot tolerate this."
    Kenzo Nakajima, Chairman of the Japan-China Cultural Exchange Association, said in a statement on the 30th that the Sato government's formal rejection of the entry of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation, which was scheduled to visit Japan at the invitation of the Japanese Socialist Party, is not only an attack on the Socialist Party but also an attack on the entire Japanese people. Nakajima pointed out that no illusions should be held about the Sato government, and the people of the whole country must be mobilized to overthrow this government.
    More than 50 Japanese Japan-China friendship and trade organizations, peace organizations, trade unions, women's, and religious groups established a liaison committee on the 30th and unanimously adopted a resolution strongly condemning the Sato government's unreasonable refusal of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation to visit Japan for a friendly exchange. The resolution pointed out that this is another evidence of the Sato government's subservience to the United States and hostility towards China.
    Japanese newspapers and news agencies pointed out that the Sato government's anti-China actions are not based on Japan's "national interests" but are based on the demands of the US imperialist policy of aggression and war. The Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 30th that the Sato government believes that "as long as the severe relationship between the United States and China surrounding the situation in Vietnam is not eased, and the US policy of 'containing' China does not change, Japan's policy towards China will not change."
    Kyodo News reported on the 29th that the Japanese government announced the rejection of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation's entry "out of such political considerations: at present, the Vietnam War is intensifying, and it is necessary to take a clear attitude on the policy towards China."

    日本公众愤怒谴责佐藤政府敌视中国的政策
    社会党强烈抗议佐藤政府拒绝中国代表团入境
    岩间正男驳斥佐藤政府诬蔑中国代表团的谬论
    新华社东京三十一日电  一贯追随美国敌视中国的佐藤政府二十九日悍然无理拒绝应日本社会党的邀请预定在最近到日本进行友好访问的中国人民外交学会代表团入境。这一无理决定立即激起了日本五十多个政党、群众团体的强烈抗议和广大社会舆论的严厉谴责。
    据报道，社会党在二十三日成立了由佐佐木委员长和党的中央执行委员会组成的欢迎委员会，并向佐藤政府提出批准中国人民外交学会代表团入境的申请。但是，在日本首相佐藤荣作授意下，日本内阁官房长官（秘书长）桥本登美三郎、外务大臣椎名悦三郎和法务大臣石井光次郎在二十九日做出无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境的决定。
    桥本登美三郎二十九日晚上，接见日本记者时为佐藤政府这一敌视中国、阻挠和破坏中日两国人民之间的友好往来的行为进行诡辩。胡说什么“从现在的国际形势和国内形势考虑，在现在的时机，允许中国代表团入境是危害（日本的）国家利益的”，会“干涉日本内政”。法务大臣石井光次郎说得更露骨。他把保护美国主子看成是日本的“国家利益”。他说：“批评同日本保持友好关系的美国，是不行的”。
    佐藤政府的这一决定，是它敌视中国政策的继续和发展。佐藤政府一直在露骨地追随美国推行“两个中国”和敌视中国的反动政策。佐藤荣作在一九六四年秋季刚上台，就无理拒绝了以彭真为首的中国共产党代表团去日本参加日本共产党第九次代表大会，接着又用所谓“吉田信件”破坏中日贸易，百般破坏和阻挠中日青年友好大联欢，并且在联合国大会上猖狂阻挠恢复中国的合法席位。外务大臣椎名悦三郎三月二十八日在参议院预算委员会上，竟然对中日青年友好大联欢进行攻击，他语无伦次地说什么日本青年到中国来参加联欢也“是对日本内政的严重干涉”。
    日本社会党二十九日发表声明，强烈抗议佐藤政府的无理的决定。声明指出：“谁也不能否认，相互交流将增进日中友好，从而对亚洲和平作出贡献”。声明说：“（佐藤）政府蹂躏了国民的希望和期待，非法地、无理地拒绝了（中国）代表团的入境。这就不但赤裸裸地暴露了佐藤内阁敌视中国的态度，而且暴露了它屈服于美帝国主义和台湾蒋介石集团的压力的屈辱外交的姿态。这件事情表明佐藤政府追随美国并同它合作企图变本加厉地扩大侵越战争。”
    日本社会党委员长佐佐木更三在三十日发表谈话指出，佐藤政府悍然拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团的入境，这是美日反动派对日本人民和亚洲人民的挑战。佐佐木表示社会党要为中国人民外交学会代表团能够访问日本斗争到底。
    日本共产党国会议员团副团长岩间正男二十九日晚发表谈话揭露佐藤政府不断地干涉中国内政的事实，并驳斥了佐藤政府诬蔑中国代表团“干涉日本内政”和“危害国家利益”的谬论。岩间指出：佐藤政府拒绝以彭真为团长的中国共产党代表团和中国外交学会代表团的入境，给今后日中关系的发展制造了严重的障碍。这是佐藤政府越来越参与美国侵略越南和“遏制”中国的又一个新的表现。岩间说：“佐藤政府对中国代表团的这种无理的、非法的攻击，是对争取独立、和平、民主，要求日中友好和早日恢复两国邦交的广大日本人民的挑衅。日本人民对此绝对不能容忍”。
    日中文化交流协会理事长中岛健藏三十日发表谈话说，佐藤政府正式拒绝应日本社会党的邀请预定访问日本的中国人民外交学会代表团的入境，这不仅是对社会党的进攻，而且是对全体日本人民的进攻。中岛指出，对佐藤政府决不应该抱任何幻想，必须发动全国人民推翻这个政府。
    日本五十多个日中友好和贸易团体、和平组织、工会、妇女以及宗教团体，三十日成立联络委员会，并且一致通过决议，强烈谴责佐藤政府无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团到日本进行友好访问。决议指出，这是佐藤政府屈从美国、敌视中国的又一罪证。
    日本的报刊、通讯社指出，佐藤政府的这一敌视中国的行动不是根据日本的“国家利益”，而是根据美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策的要求而决定的。《每日新闻》三十日报道，佐藤政府认为“围绕着越南形势只要美中两国的严峻关系没有缓和，美国‘遏制’中国的政策不改变，日本对中国的政策也不会改变”。
    共同社二十九日报道，日本政府宣布拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境，“是出于这种政治考虑：目前越南战争日趋加剧，需要在对中国政策上采取明确的态度。”
