    Is it using Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to mobilize the masses, or treating giving money and goods as the only or main method? This is not only a matter of method, but also a question of whether or not we believe in the proletariat's self-liberation of the masses.

    Last year, while conducting investigations in rural areas, I deeply realized that to fundamentally change the impoverished face of a backward area, we must use proletarian revolutionary thought to mobilize and organize the masses, and promote the revolutionary spirit to increase production through self-reliance. Failing to educate the masses and simply providing economic support, just giving money, grain, and goods, is actually a gift-giving viewpoint that does not believe in the masses, and will lead cadres and the masses onto a wrong path.

    In our county, there is a high-altitude, cold commune with relatively backward production, with an annual grain yield of only eighty or ninety jin per mu. How can we change the face of this commune? In the past, we relied solely on giving money, grain, and goods for support. Whether it was grain supply, cattle loans, living allowances, etc., this commune was always the first, the earliest, and the most to receive them. However, for many years, their impoverished appearance has not changed much.

    What are the influences and harms brought by the gift-giving viewpoint to this commune? One is that it did not lead the grassroots cadres on the right path. Some cadres, when mobilizing the masses, did not use Mao Zedong Thought or the Party's policies, but instead told the masses, "Let's all work hard, and if we do well, I'll go to the district and ask for some things." Another is that some people among the masses have formed the idea of relying on the state. This situation shows that we do not believe in the masses, have not given the Party's policies to the masses, and have not used Mao Zedong Thought to lead the masses forward, thus harming the fundamental interests of the masses. This is not just a matter of method, but also a matter of stance.

    Chairman Mao said in "Concern for the Well-being of the Masses, Attention to Working Methods": "Do you want to win the support of the masses? Do you want the masses to put all their strength into the front? Then you must be with the masses and mobilize their enthusiasm." After carefully pondering these words of Chairman Mao, we began to realize that it is right to give appropriate economic support to a difficult area; however, treating giving things as the only or main way to do work is wrong, it is a gift-giving viewpoint that does not believe that the masses can liberate themselves.

    Grasping the crux of the problem, our work team vigorously promoted the Party's policies on changing the backward face of mountain areas among the masses, vigorously promoted the perseverance of "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains" in overcoming difficulties, and vigorously promoted the spirit of Dazhai's self-reliance. After the Party's policies were given to the masses, the commune members reflected: "Others are supporting national construction, but we are the only ones who reach out to the state for grain and money every year, and we really feel sorry." "We also want to improve production, but we just don't know how to do it." Originally, the masses were not willing to lie on the state and were even less willing to be impoverished and backward. They had revolutionary enthusiasm, but the problem was that we didn't lead them on the right path. Some said: This time, we will be like the people of Dazhai, using our own hands to work hard and strive to improve production. While discussing, everyone formulated production plans and measures based on the actual situation. Because there was a lack of water, everyone decided to build eighteen ditches first. At that time, the drought was severe, and many young women in the teams carried water and shouldered water to fight the drought and plant corn. After working like this for a year, the situation in the commune began to change. Last year, in the face of very severe natural disasters, eight of the seventeen teams in the entire commune still increased production, and the production of the entire commune was also at the forefront in the whole district.

    The iron facts educated me and made me realize that the masses not only have the desire to change the face of poverty, but also contain the infinite wisdom and power to change the backward face. Only when we truly use revolutionary thought to mobilize the masses and inspire their revolutionary enthusiasm can we fundamentally change the situation of poverty and backwardness.

### 用阶级观点破恩赐观点

专栏：怎样正确认识和处理政治与生产的关系？

    用阶级观点破恩赐观点
    是用毛泽东思想、用党的政策去发动群众，还是把给钱给物当作唯一的或主要的办法？这不仅是方法问题，而且是相信不相信群众自己解放自己的无产阶级立场问题
    去年下乡作调查，我深深体会到：要使一个落后地区的贫困面貌得到根本改变，必须用无产阶级革命的思想去发动群众，组织群众，发扬革命精神，自力更生地把生产闹上去。不去教育群众，只是从经济上给予扶持，只是给钱给粮给物，实际上是不相信群众的恩赐观点，结果会把干部和群众引导到邪路上去。
    我县有个高寒公社，生产比较落后，全年粮食单产才八九十斤。怎样改变这个公社的面貌呢？过去，我们单纯地靠给钱给粮给物来扶持。无论是粮食供应、耕牛贷款、生活补助等等，给这个公社的都是最先、最早、最多。可是，多年以来，他们的贫困面貌没有什么改变。
    恩赐观点给这个公社带来的影响和危害是什么呢？一个是没有把基层干部带对路。有的干部发动群众，不是用毛泽东思想，不是用党的政策，而是对群众说：“大家好好干吧，干好了我到区上去要点东西来。”另一个是，群众中也有一些人形成了依赖国家的思想。这个情况，说明我们不相信群众，没有把党的政策交给群众，没有用毛泽东思想领导群众前进，因此使群众的根本利益受到损失。这不仅是个方法问题，也是个立场问题。
    毛主席在《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》一文中说：“要得到群众的拥护么？要群众拿出他们的全力放到战线上去么？那末，就得和群众在一起，就得去发动群众的积极性”。细细琢磨毛主席的这些话，我们开始认识到，对一个困难地区，在经济上给予适当的扶持，是应该的；但是，把给东西当作做工作的唯一办法或主要办法，那就错了，那是不相信群众能够自己解放自己的恩赐观点。
    抓住了问题的所在，我们工作组在群众中大讲党的关于改变山区落后面貌的政策，大讲“愚公移山”克服困难的毅力，大讲大寨自力更生的精神。党的政策交给群众以后，社员们纷纷反映：“别人都在支援国家建设，唯有我们年年伸手向国家要粮要钱，心里着实过意不去。”“我们也是想搞好生产的，可就是不知道怎么搞法。”原来，群众并不愿意躺在国家身上，更不甘心贫困落后，他们有着革命的积极性，问题是我们没把他们往正路上引。有的表示：这回嘛，我们要象大寨人那样，用自己的双手，奋发图强搞生产。大家一边讨论，一边就根据实际情况制订了生产规划和措施。这里缺水，大家决定先修十八条水沟。当时，旱象严重，许多队的青年妇女就挑水、背水抗旱点种包谷。这样干了一年，公社的情况开始发生变化。去年在自然灾害十分严重的情况下，全公社十七个队仍有八个队增了产，整个公社生产在全区比较起来，也是走在前面的。
    铁的事实教育了我，使我认识到群众不仅有改变贫困面貌的要求，同时也蕴藏着改变落后面貌的无穷智慧和力量。我们只有真正用革命的思想去发动群众，启发他们革命的积极性，才能根本改变贫困落后的状况。
