    "New Peddler"
    ——To the Deliveryman	Worker of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, Yi Liangui
    Lathe tools and drills are shining bright,
    Oil cans gleam, spraying fragrant oil,
    Along with your burning heart,
    All loaded onto the cart!
    You push the cart through the workshop,
    Hey, who doesn't say:
    What a great "New Peddler"!
    What a great "New Peddler,"
    Sweat洒遍 beside the machines.
    Hundreds of workers in the workshop,
    You remember what everyone needs.
    Before this machine even stops,
    You hand the oil can to their side;
    While that chuck is still spinning,
    New lathe tools are delivered again...
    What a great "New Peddler,"
    Hardware and goods loaded on the cart.
    A red heart pulls the cart,
    Flying by all the machines!
    Hundreds of workers in the workshop,
    All praise in unison.
    Thousands of words into one sentence:
    You've learned "Serve the People" so well!	〔Selected from "Anshan Daily"〕

    “新货郎”
    ——给送料员	鞍山钢铁公司工人　易连贵
    车刀、钻头亮光光，
    油壶铮亮喷油香，
    连你那颗滚烫的心，
    一齐装车上！
    你推着货车车间里走呵，
    嘿，谁不说：
    好一个“新货郎”！
    好一个“新货郎”呵，
    汗水洒遍机床旁。
    车间工人几百名，
    谁需要啥你都记心上。
    这边机床还没停稳，
    你把油壶递身旁；
    那边卡盘还在飞，
    新的车刀又送上。……
    好一个“新货郎”呵，
    五金百货车上装。
    红心牵着货车飞，
    飞遍所有机床旁！
    车间工人几百名，
    齐声来赞扬。
    千言万语汇一句：
    是你《为人民服务》学的棒！　〔选自《鞍钢日报》〕
