    Beijing has recently produced various kinds of dehydrated vegetables, which are being transported to remote forest areas and mountainous regions for forest workers and geological prospectors.

    The dehydrated vegetables that have been produced are divided into two categories: loose-packed and compressed into blocks. The varieties include over ten types, such as cauliflower, rapeseed, cabbage, onions, and bell peppers. Their color, taste, and crispness are similar to fresh vegetables, and they retain over 50% of their vitamins. Simply soak the dehydrated vegetables in an appropriate amount of cold or warm water to rehydrate them, and then cook them according to normal methods to create various dishes. One pound of dehydrated vegetables, when rehydrated, is equivalent to seven or eight pounds of fresh vegetables.

    The greatest advantage of dehydrated vegetables is their light weight and small size, making them easy to preserve and transport. Their weight is 90% to 95% lighter than fresh vegetables; the volume of dehydrated vegetables compressed into blocks is only one-thirtieth to one-seventieth of that of fresh vegetables.

    When the reporter recently visited the Beijing Vegetable Dehydration Factory, he saw that, in addition to manually washing the fresh vegetables to remove mud and sand and discarding rotten and insect-infested leaves, other processes, from chopping and blanching to drying, were mechanized. After the vegetables are steam-blanched and treated with sulfur, the enzymes that cause the vegetables to mold are destroyed, and the microorganisms and insect eggs on the surface of the vegetables are eliminated. This also prevents the loss of vitamins and discoloration during the processing and storage of the vegetables.

### 北京制成十几种脱水蔬菜  供森林工作者和地质勘探人员食用

    北京制成十几种脱水蔬菜
    供森林工作者和地质勘探人员食用
    据新华社讯　北京新近制成的各种脱水蔬菜，正在运往边远的林区和山区供森林工作者和地质勘探人员食用。
    已经制成的脱水蔬菜，分散装和压缩成块状两类，品种有菜花、油菜、卷心菜、洋葱头、柿子椒等十几种。它们的色泽、味道和脆度，同新鲜蔬菜相似，维生素保持在百分之五十以上。只要把脱水蔬菜放在适量的冷水或温水里浸泡复元，然后按常法烹调，就能做成各种菜肴。一斤脱水蔬菜复水后，相当于七八斤鲜菜。
    脱水蔬菜的最大优点是重量轻，体积小，便于保存和运输。它们的重量比新鲜蔬菜轻百分之九十到百分之九十五；压缩成块状的脱水蔬菜，体积只等于鲜菜的三十分之一到七十分之一。
    记者最近在北京市蔬菜脱水厂参观时看到，这里加工脱水蔬菜，除了用人工洗净鲜菜的泥沙、去掉腐烂和虫蛀的菜叶之外，其他工序从切碎、热烫一直到烘干，都是采用机械化生产的。菜经过蒸汽热烫和硫处理之后，破坏了促使蔬菜霉烂的酶，消灭了蔬菜表面的微生物和虫卵，而且防止了维生素的损失和蔬菜加工、贮藏期间的变色问题。
