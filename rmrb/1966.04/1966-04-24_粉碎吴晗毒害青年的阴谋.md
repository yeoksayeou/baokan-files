    Wu Han's methods of poisoning the youth are extremely sinister. His usual trick is to encourage young people to dare to "become famous and establish themselves," so as to become bourgeois "experts" like him. He calls on young people to learn from him, to learn from his experience of finally "becoming an expert and scholar."

    And what is his experience? It is the "hard work" he peddles in large quantities, "delving into the vast Ming Dynasty historical materials," "reading diligently, copying diligently, writing diligently," "reading more, reading more, reading honestly, reading seriously," and so on. In short, never leave the "textbook," only read, not practice. Only allowed to burrow into research rooms and libraries, never allowed to participate in the three great revolutionary movements, especially not allowed to participate in class struggle. What books does he want us young people to read? Without a doubt, not the books of Marxism-Leninism, the books of Chairman Mao, not revolutionary books, but to "delve into the materials," burrow into the piles of old papers, and "honestly" read ancient books, and books written by bourgeois literati like Wu Han.

    Wu Han also warned us: "Anyone can become an expert and scholar, the key lies in whether they themselves work hard, whether they can overcome all the difficulties blocking them." Under the powerful conditions of the proletarian dictatorship, Wu Han further pointed out to young people that to become famous and establish themselves, one must also "master the environment, not be controlled by the environment." What does this mean? This is to make us engage in individualism, to make us not obey the needs of the socialist motherland. It seems that Wu Han's concern for young people "becoming famous and establishing themselves" can be described as meticulous.

    I was deceived by Wu Han and poisoned by his ideas of "reading first" and "becoming famous and establishing oneself." From 1961 to 1962, when I was in the first year of high school, I read some of Wu Han's articles and developed a thought of "becoming famous and establishing myself." At the same time, from Wu Han's articles, I also found the "only path" to becoming famous and establishing myself. At that time, I thought Wu Han's articles were "sending charcoal in the snow" to me, and I was "encouraged" by them. Didn't Wu Han keep saying that the "key to becoming famous and establishing oneself lies in whether they themselves work hard"? So, my individualistic "engine" for becoming famous and establishing myself in the future started to rotate at high speed, working overtime, turning non-stop. At that time, I only had one thought: I must get into a higher institution of learning. What I said was "one red heart, multiple preparations," but in reality, I only made one preparation. I studied desperately, and ideological remolding naturally became lax. Studying Chairman Mao's works and learning from Lei Feng was difficult to absorb. Even if I studied, it was just a formality, to show progress.

    After entering university, this thought of studying for personal fame and fortune was never overcome. Recently, in the outlook on life education movement carried out in the school, I boldly exposed my individualistic learning goals. After the exposure, through the study of Chairman Mao's works, and analyzing it from the perspective of class struggle, I was shocked and shouted: "Very dangerous!" This is a matter of whether or not to make revolution.

    I want to tell Comrade Wu Han: You want us to be the successors of the bourgeoisie, that's impossible! We are young people cultivated by the Party and taught by Mao Zedong Thought, we must be the successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    粉碎吴晗毒害青年的阴谋	北京大学法律系　李成义
    吴晗同志毒害青年的手段是极其险恶的。他惯用的伎俩，就是鼓励青年要敢于“成名成家”，以便成为象他那样的资产阶级“专家”。他号召青年向他学习，学习他终于“成为专家学者”的经验。
    他的经验又是什么呢？就是他大量推销的下“苦功夫”，“钻到浩瀚的明史资料中去”，“勤读，勤抄，勤写”，“要加倍地读书，多读书，老老实实地读书，认真地读书”，“书念得越多越好”，等等。总之，千万不能离开“本本”，只要读书，不要实践。只能钻到研究室、图书馆里，绝不能参加三大革命运动，尤其是不能参加阶级斗争。他要我们青年读什么书呢？毫无疑问，不是读马列主义的书、毛主席的书，不是读革命的书，而是“深入到资料中去”，钻到故纸堆里，“老老实实地”读古书，读吴晗之流的资产阶级文人所写的书。
    吴晗又告诫我们：“任何一个人都可以成为专家学者，问题的关键就在于自己是否努力，是否能克服挡在他面前的一切困难。”在强大的无产阶级专政的条件下，吴晗还进一步给青年指出，要成名成家，还必须“人要掌握环境，而不能被环境所支配”。这是什么话呢？这就是要我们闹个人主义，要我们不去服从社会主义祖国的需要。——看来，吴晗对青年人“成名成家”的关心，可谓无微不至了。
    我受过吴晗的骗，中了他的读书第一、成名成家思想之毒。一九六一年到一九六二年，我在高中一年级念书的时候，看了吴晗一些文章，就产生了一种“成名成家”的念头。同时从吴晗的文章中，我也找到了成名成家的“唯一道路”。当时我认为，吴晗的文章对自己是“雪中送炭”，从中得到“鼓舞”。吴晗不是口口声声地说成名成家“问题的关键就在于自己是否努力”吗？于是，我那台为自己将来成名成家的个人主义“发动机”，便高速度地旋转起来，加班加点，转个不停。那时，我只有一个念头：一定要考上高等学府。嘴上说的是“一颗红心，多种准备”，实际上只做了一种准备。我拼命读书，思想改造就自然而然地放松了。学习毛主席著作，学习雷锋，学不进去。就是学也是走走形式，以表示进步。
    到了大学以后，这种为个人名利地位而学习的思想一直没有得到克服。最近，在学校开展的人生观教育运动中，我大胆地暴露了自己的个人主义的学习目的。暴露以后，通过毛主席著作的学习，用阶级斗争的观点一分析，自己大吃一惊，高叫一声：“危险得很！”这是关系到革命不革命的问题。
    我要告诉吴晗同志：你要我们做资产阶级的接班人，办不到！我们是党培养起来的、毛泽东思想教导下的青年，我们一定要做无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
