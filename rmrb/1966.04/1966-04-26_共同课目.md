    “Common Subject”	Yao Renwei
    The protagonist Luo Yuifeng in the novel *Political Instructor*, although a military commander, emphasizes politics in everything. He calls emphasizing politics the "common subject" for company-level cadres. This name is well-chosen, concise, and thought-provoking.
    The fundamental reason for calling emphasizing politics a "common subject" is that our military, economic, cultural, and other tasks are all components of the proletarian revolutionary cause, all subordinate to the proletarian political line, and serve proletarian politics. Regarding a person's specific work, although "each does his own job, selling sugar while beating a gong," this is only a different division of labor in revolutionary work. The common goal, however, is to serve proletarian politics.
    It is called a "common subject" because facts have repeatedly and eloquently told us that, whether in production, professional work, or technology, whenever politics is emphasized and Mao Zedong Thought is put in command, we can adhere to the correct direction, have methods and strength when we work, and the work will be done well and effectively. Conversely, if we are busy and bustling, in the end, we will not be able to make a name for ourselves, and may even go down the wrong path.
    It is called a "common subject" also because politics "is a struggle between classes." Major issues such as national planning and people's livelihood, and minor issues such as certain aspects of personal life, all reflect the struggle between two ideologies and two roads. In this struggle, if we do not emphasize proletarian politics, we will emphasize bourgeois politics. If you don't manage politics, politics will manage you. In the reality of life, which is full of class struggle, there is no such thing as being beyond politics; it is impossible.
    Some people think that "emphasizing politics is the business of the Party Committee and political departments; if one is 'not in that position,' one can 'not concern oneself with its policies'." Little do they know that their "position" is a revolutionary post, and they should "concern themselves" with proletarian politics, consciously obey the overall political task, and link all specific work with the entire revolutionary cause, and link daily, ordinary work with lofty communist ideals. In this sense, the "common subject," in the final analysis, isn't it our common cause and common ideal?
    The Party Committee and political departments must, of course, emphasize politics, and all administrative cadres must also emphasize politics. Only by jointly grasping this "common subject" tightly and well can our various tasks exert the greatest combat effectiveness.

### “共同课目”

    “共同课目”	姚人为
    小说《政治连长》中的主人公罗玉锋，虽是军事指挥员，却是事事突出政治。他把突出政治，叫作连队干部的“共同课目”。这个名称取得好，言简意赅，很能发人深思。
    把突出政治说成是“共同课目”，根本的理由是：我们的军事、经济、文化等各项工作，都是无产阶级革命事业的组成部分，都是从属于无产阶级的政治路线，为无产阶级的政治服务的。就一个人的具体工作来说，尽管“打锣卖糖，各干一行”，但这只是革命工作分工的不同，为无产阶级的政治服务这一总目标，却是共同的。
    说它是“共同课目”，因为事实一再雄辩地告诉我们：不论生产、业务、技术，凡是突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，就能够坚持正确的方向，干起工作来就有办法，有力量，工作也就干得好，有成效。反之，忙来忙去，最终也忙不出个名堂来，甚至还会走到邪路上去。
    说它是“共同课目”，还由于政治“是阶级对阶级的斗争”，大至国计民生，小至个人生活上的某些问题，都反映着两种思想、两条道路的斗争；在这个斗争中，不突出无产阶级的政治，就会突出资产阶级的政治。你不管政治，政治要来管你。在充满阶级斗争的现实生活中，超政治的事情是没有的，是不可能的。
    有人认为“突出政治是党委和政治部门的事，‘不在其位’，可以‘不谋其政’”。殊不知自己的“位”是革命岗位，理应为无产阶级的政治而“谋”，自觉地服从总的政治任务，把各项具体工作同整个革命事业联系起来，把日常的、平凡的工作同远大的共产主义理想联系起来。从这个意义上说，“共问课目”，说到底，不也就是我们的共同事业和共同理想么？
    党委和政治部门固然要突出政治，一切行政干部也要突出政治。只有共同把这个“共同课目”抓紧抓好，我们的各项工作才能发挥最大的战斗力。
