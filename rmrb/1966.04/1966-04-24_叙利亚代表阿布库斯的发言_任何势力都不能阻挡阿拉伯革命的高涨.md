    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd - Syrian representative A. al-Abukus, in his speech at the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 22nd, said that the revolutionary struggle of the Arab people is developing and growing, the Arab revolution has entered the stage of world people's revolution, and has begun to make its own contribution to crushing imperialism headed by the United States. He said that no force of any kind that lives on dollars and colonialist lies can stop the upsurge of the Arab revolution, nor can it destroy the unity of the Arab people in the front of striving for liberation.
    Abukus said that since the United States occupied the land of the Arab people - Palestine - and gave it to its lackey, the racist, aggressive Zionist gang, the Arab people have become clearer about the role played by the United States in their country. Therefore, they will not be fooled by the peaceful coexistence advocated by Bourguiba. Peaceful coexistence is a scam of our time. They will also not be deceived by the lies of the Islamic treaty, which was created by neocolonialism to change the Arab revolution from a national one to a religious one, isolating it from the revolutions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.
    He said that glory belongs to the Arab people of Palestine. They are waging a great struggle against Zionism, the lackey of the head of neocolonialism, the United States, who occupies their homeland.
    He pointed out that the people who have won independence with their own blood are invincible, they will surely clear colonialism from their own territory and realize all their ideals.
    Abukus finally asked everyone to stand up and observe a minute of silence to mourn the journalist colleagues who were killed by the reactionary military bandits in Jakarta and the colonialist lackeys in Ghana. He said that our silent tribute to our murdered colleagues is a strong protest against the crimes of trampling on freedom of the press, imprisoning journalists, and closing newspapers in Indonesia, Bahrain, Aden, Morocco, Ghana, and countries where freedom of speech is persecuted by colonialists and their lackeys.

    叙利亚代表阿布库斯的发言
    任何势力都不能阻挡阿拉伯革命的高涨
    新华社二十三日讯　叙利亚代表阿·勒·阿布库斯，二十二日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上的发言中说，阿拉伯人民革命斗争正在发展壮大，阿拉伯革命已跨入世界人民革命的舞台，并开始为粉碎以美国为首的帝国主义而作出自己的贡献。他说，任何依靠美元和殖民主义谎言过活的势力中的任何一种势力，都不能阻挡阿拉伯革命的高涨，都不能摧毁阿拉伯人民在争取解放的阵线中的团结。
    阿布库斯说，自从美国霸占了阿拉伯人民的土地——巴勒斯坦，并把它送给它的走狗、种族主义的、侵略成性的犹太复国主义匪帮的那天起，阿拉伯人民对美国在他们国家内所扮演的角色就知道的更清楚了。因此，他们不会上布尔吉巴所主张的和平共处的当。和平共处是我们时代的骗局。他们也不会受伊斯兰条约谎言的欺骗，这个条约是新殖民主义一手制造的，目的是将阿拉伯革命由民族性的改变为宗教性的，使它孤立于亚、非、拉革命之外。
    他说，光荣属于巴勒斯坦阿拉伯人民。他们正在同侵占自己国土的新殖民主义头子美国的走狗犹太复国主义进行一场伟大的斗争。
    他指出，用自己的鲜血赢得了独立的人民是不可战胜的，他们必将从自己的国土上清除殖民主义，并实现自己的全部理想。
    阿布库斯最后请大家起立，静默一分钟，向被雅加达反动军事匪徒和加纳殖民主义走狗们所杀害的新闻工作者同业们致哀。他说，我们为被杀害的同事们静默致哀，就是对在印度尼西亚、巴林、亚丁、摩洛哥、加纳以及在言论受到殖民主义者及其走狗迫害的国家内，践踏新闻自由、监禁新闻工作者和封闭报纸的种种罪行，所作的强烈抗议。
