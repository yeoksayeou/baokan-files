    According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, a statement issued today by the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee pointed out that the fascist act of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary military personnel in illegally arresting members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Indonesia fully exposed their ferocious features as agents of U.S. imperialism. The statement demanded that the Indonesian authorities immediately and unconditionally release the four members of this delegation, guarantee their personal safety and freedom of movement, and punish those responsible for this atrocity.
    On November 17, 1965, Indonesian right-wing reactionary military personnel suddenly broke into the office of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Jakarta, which was stationed in Indonesia, conducted a search, robbed the delegation's property, and arrested the delegation leader Ibrahim Mohamad, deputy leader Yu Zhuye, secretary Abdullah Sudin, and delegation member Shamsiah Fakeh. These four have not yet been released and their whereabouts are unknown.
    In a statement issued today by the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee condemning the Indonesian right-wing clique's illegal arrest of members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Indonesia, it was pointed out that this shocking atrocity by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces is part of the countless barbaric crimes they have committed in broad daylight. Their fascist behavior has been severely condemned by the Malayan people, the people of Asian and African countries, and all justice-upholding people. The statement said: "The Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Indonesia is a legal organization formally established in Jakarta in June 1965 with the full permission of the Indonesian government. Its establishment and activities have made due contributions to opposing imperialism and its running dogs and to strengthening the friendship between the Malayan and Indonesian peoples. Therefore, it has been warmly supported by the Indonesian people and has also been sponsored and welcomed by Indonesian official institutions and government officials. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, disregarding international practice, have illegally arrested and detained members of this legal delegation for as long as five months, neither daring to explain to the people nor admitting their mistake and releasing them. Their barbaric acts are well known to the world. This fascist behavior, which is hostile to progressive forces, fully exposes their ferocious features as agents of U.S. imperialism. This behavior completely violates the common interests of Asian and African people in uniting against imperialism and violates the wishes of the Indonesian people and the policies announced by the Indonesian government itself.
      "The Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee strongly condemns the Indonesian right-wing reactionary military personnel for their crimes of persecuting the four members of the Malayan National Liberation League's delegation in Indonesia! We fully support the just position and reasonable demands expressed in the statement of the Central Committee of the Malayan National Liberation League on December 5, 1965, and the public communique of the Malayan People's Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee on February 7, 1966. The Indonesian authorities must immediately and unconditionally release the four members of the delegation, guarantee their personal safety and freedom of movement, and punish those responsible for this atrocity.

    我亚非团结会声明指出印尼右派军人是美帝代理人
    谴责印尼反动派迫害马来亚解放同盟代表团
    必须立即释放代表团成员并保证他们的安全和行动自由
    据新华社二十七日讯　中国亚非团结委员会今天发表的一项声明指出，印度尼西亚右派反动军人非法逮捕马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团成员的法西斯行为，完全暴露了它们是美帝国主义代理人的凶恶面目。声明要求印度尼西亚当局必须立即无条件释放这个代表团的四名成员，保证他们的人身安全和行动自由，惩办制造这一暴行的有关人员。
    一九六五年十一月十七日印度尼西亚右派反动军人突然闯入马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团在雅加达的办公室进行搜查，抢走了代表团的财物，逮捕了代表团团长易卜拉欣·穆罕默德、副团长余柱业、秘书阿卜杜拉·苏丁和团员沙姆西亚·法克赫等四人，至今这四人仍未获释放，下落不明。
    中国亚非团结委员会今天在关于谴责印度尼西亚右派集团非法逮捕马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团成员的声明中指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力这一骇人听闻的暴行，是他们在光天化日之下所干下的无数野蛮罪行的一部分。他们的法西斯行为遭到了马来亚人民、亚非各国人民和一切主持正义的人民的严厉谴责。声明说：“马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团是在印度尼西亚政府的完全许可下，于一九六五年六月在雅加达正式设立的合法机构。它的设立及其活动，为反对帝国主义及其走狗、为加强马来亚和印度尼西亚人民的友谊作出了应有的贡献，因此它曾受到印度尼西亚人民的热情支持，也受到印度尼西亚官方机构和政府官员的赞助和欢迎。印度尼西亚右派反动势力竟不顾国际惯例，把这一合法代表团成员非法逮捕拘留已达五个月之久，既不敢向人民交代，又不认错释放，其野蛮行径已为世人所共知。这种与进步力量为敌的法西斯行为完全暴露了它们是美帝国主义代理人的凶恶面目。这种行为完全违背了亚非人民团结反帝的共同利益，并且违反了印度尼西亚人民的意愿和印度尼西亚政府自己所宣布的政策。
      “中国亚非团结委员会强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派反动军人对马来亚民族解放同盟驻印度尼西亚代表团四成员的迫害罪行！我们完全支持马来亚民族解放同盟中央委员会一九六五年十二月五日声明和马来亚人民亚非团结委员会一九六六年二月七日公报中所表示的正义立场和合理要求。印度尼西亚当局必须立即无条件释放该代表团的四位成员，保证他们的人身安全和行动自由，并惩办制造这一暴行的有关人员。
