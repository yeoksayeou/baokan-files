    Planned Guidance of Urban Youth to the Countryside
    ——Experiences of Changchun City in Managing and Educating Urban Youth
    The CCP Changchun Municipal Committee

    Editor's Note: To manage and educate urban youth well, and to guide the majority of them to the countryside in a planned way, is not only a major undertaking for cultivating revolutionary successors, but also of great significance for building a new socialist countryside, strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance, and gradually reducing the differences between mental and manual labor.

    In recent years, Changchun City has adopted various forms and channels to organize urban youth, provide them with good education, and organize them to go to the mountains and the countryside to participate in agricultural production labor. The methods they have adopted are: First, to pilot semi-agricultural, semi-study schools in the countryside that both recruit students from the city and send them back to the city, and also recruit educated youth from the countryside. These students can both work and study, and after graduation, they participate in production labor locally. Through several years of study, they have learned agricultural production labor and have a certain level of culture and technology. The peasants welcome them, and they are also content with production. Second, to pilot schools in the city that are both city-based and community-based, and that take into account both urban and rural areas. These schools are located in the city and oriented towards the countryside. They regularly organize students to participate in agricultural production labor, cultivate the labor viewpoint and labor habits of young people, and enable them to learn certain agricultural knowledge and production technology, so as to create the necessary conditions for going to the mountains and the countryside in the future. The other two methods are to pilot labor reserve training centers in the streets and to establish collective households for educated youth going to the countryside in the production brigades of rural communes. This is also an important channel for guiding urban youth to the countryside.

    Changchun City insists on being responsible to the end for educated youth going to the countryside, and has played the role of the "rear," providing great care in terms of political ideology and life, and has carried out a lot of work. All of these are worthy of reference for various localities.

    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, with the development of industrial and agricultural production, the education cause in Changchun City has greatly developed. Primary education was universalized in 1956. Afterwards, the method of "walking on two legs" was adopted. While developing state-run schools and factory-run schools, the masses were also mobilized to run schools, so that the vast majority of senior primary school graduates were able to continue their education. Since 1964, the two labor systems and the two education systems have been implemented, and a number of part-work (farming) part-study schools have been piloted, which has further developed urban secondary education. However, there are still some young people who have not continued their education or found employment. In the face of this situation, the streets have also set up labor reserve training centers, absorbing some young people to participate in study and labor. In this way, the city's young people are generally organized.

    Several Ways to Guide Urban Youth to the Countryside

    The current question is, on the one hand, how to continue to manage and educate young people well; on the other hand, in addition to cultivating labor reserve forces for factories and enterprises, the main thing is how to actively guide them to the countryside. According to several years of exploration, we have generally adopted the following methods:

    Running Semi-Agricultural, Semi-Study Schools in the City that are both City-Based and Community-Based

    There are currently three such schools, two horticultural schools and one farming-reading middle school, with 832 students. Students are recruited from the city and assigned to the countryside after graduation.

    Running schools that are oriented towards the countryside, and that are both city-based and community-based, is a way to manage and educate urban youth and guide them to the countryside. For example, the Erdaohezi District jointly ran a horticultural school in 1960 by eight collectively-owned farms. In the past six years, it has had 129 graduates, most of whom are content with agricultural production. Now, some serve as production team leaders and political team leaders, some serve as technicians, accountants, and laboratory technicians, some serve as study instructors of Chairman Mao's works in the production teams, and some have been selected as Five-Good members and member representatives. Many people have become the backbone of various tasks. In agricultural production, they have carried out scientific experiments together with the old farmers and have achieved certain results. The technology extension station reflects that since the graduates of the horticultural school came, there have been more scientific experiment projects, technology has been promoted faster, and pesticides have been used better. Another example is the first farming-reading middle school, which was founded in 1964 and currently has 585 students. The school regularly conducts ideological education for students, orienting them towards the countryside, and systematically organizes them to participate in agricultural production and other various labors. After more than a year of education and labor, the students' ideological feelings have undergone great changes. In labor, they are not afraid of getting dirty or tired, and they can endure hardship and hard work. Many students have begun to establish the idea of ​​taking agriculture as an honor and aspiring to engage in agriculture. This school has also strengthened the students' labor skills training. Last year, the school planted 504 mu of land, of which 160,000 jin of sorghum, corn, etc. were harvested.

    Running Semi-Agricultural, Semi-Study Schools in the Countryside that are both City-Based and Community-Based

    There are currently three such schools, two labor universities and one normal school, with a total of 1,734 students. The two labor universities are of an experimental nature. One is located in the mountainous area. With the support of relevant departments of the province and prefecture, we established a youth forestry and reclamation farm in the Changbai Mountains of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in 1962, mainly to arrange urban educated youth to work and produce; in 1964, we established a semi-agricultural, semi-study forestry and reclamation technology school here; in 1965, it was changed to Changbai Mountain Labor University, led by Antu County of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, and it still mainly recruited graduates from our city's senior and junior high schools. The other is the Nong'an Farming-Reading University, which is located in the countryside. These two universities are bases for cultivating talents for the countryside and also bases for agricultural scientific experiments. The schools have specialties such as agronomy, forestry, agricultural machinery, and animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. They are divided into undergraduate and preparatory courses, and recruit graduates from senior and junior high schools. These two universities and their predecessors, in the process of their establishment, in addition to using some state subsidies as school operating funds, mainly relied on teachers and students to do it themselves, reclaim wasteland for farming, and build schools through labor. Although they are located in the countryside, they have close ties with the city. The city is their "rear." Cadres and teachers are sent from the city, and they are supported from all aspects.

    Running labor universities in the countryside, closely combined with production practice and the masses of peasants, is conducive to transforming thinking and reforming teaching. At the same time, it also creates favorable conditions for students to stay in the countryside after graduation. Yang Mengqiang, a student of Changbai Mountain Labor University, went to the Youth Forestry and Reclamation Farm in 1963. At first, he thought that there was no future in the mountain valley and was very uneasy. After labor training, his thinking continued to improve. He joined the Youth League, was rated as a "Five-Good Youth," became the captain of the paddy field, and was determined to improve the rice varieties in the mountainous area. In 1965, he mobilized his fiancée to come to the mountain as well. Some university graduates volunteered to stay and serve as teachers after working and interning here. Some teachers not only took the initiative to come here to teach, becoming "volunteers," but also brought their families to settle down in the mountainous area.

    Running Schools in the City that take into account both Urban and Rural Areas

    There are currently nine such schools, with more than 5,800 students. These schools that take into account both urban and rural areas are mainly oriented towards the countryside, cultivating new types of laborers for the countryside. Students participate in both industrial labor and agricultural labor. The industries they engage in are also mainly those needed by the countryside. Most of the students will go to the countryside after graduation. Junior high school-level work-study middle schools have all opened basic agricultural knowledge courses, and they learn some industrial and agricultural production skills through labor. The specialties set up by secondary technical schools, as well as the types of industrial labor, such as carpentry, bricklaying, and electrician, try to take into account both urban and rural common use.

    Schools that take into account both urban and rural areas often strengthen ideological education that is oriented towards the countryside and serves agricultural production, and regularly organize student service teams to go to the countryside to understand the countryside, familiarize themselves with the peasants, and serve the poor and lower-middle peasants. The Second Work-Study Middle School organized students studying carpentry and electrical engineering to go to the suburbs to make furniture and install electric lights for the commune members. The Municipal Construction Engineering School organized teachers and students to go to the countryside to repair doors and windows, pot lids, bellows, etc. for the poor and lower-middle peasants, and built three houses for an old poor peasant in his sixties. The old poor peasant was very moved and said, "It is really thanks to Chairman Mao's blessing. If there were no Communist Party and Chairman Mao, I would not be able to build a house in my lifetime!" Teachers and students lived in the homes of poor and lower-middle peasants. The old poor peasants told them their family history, and they publicized current events to the commune members, gave haircuts and carried water for the commune members, and also participated in labor with the commune members. They were not only labor teams, but also service teams and propaganda teams. They not only received education and training from them, but also enriched their professional knowledge and learned farm work.

    Running Labor Reserve Training Centers in the Streets

    Organize idle urban youth, adopt the method of working when there is work and studying when there is no work, manage and educate them, especially carry out education on going to the mountains and the countryside, and guide them to the countryside. In the past two years, 30 labor reserve training centers have been established in the city, absorbing a group of young people to enter the centers to study. After studying and working, many people have participated in agricultural production.

    Labor reserve training centers focus on political education, supplemented by necessary cultural knowledge and scientific and technical knowledge. At the same time, they adopt the method of self-run factories and farms or linking up with factories, enterprises, and communes to organize them to participate in labor, improve their class consciousness, and learn labor skills. Students use the income from labor to solve the necessary expenses of the training centers, and they also receive a certain amount of living allowances.

    Labor reserve training centers have played a great role in uniting, educating, and transforming these young people. Most of the people who enter the centers to study are young people who are idle on the streets. After the education of the training centers, the ideological awareness of most young people has been improved, and some people who have bad habits have undergone significant changes. After these young people were organized, they became an active force in the work of the streets. They played an active role in residents' studying of Chairman Mao's works, educating children, supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary armymen and martyrs, sanitation work, and recreational activities. After they leave the centers to participate in industrial and agricultural production, most of them perform relatively well in production and labor posts.

    Establishing Collective Households for Educated Youth Going to the Countryside in Rural Production Teams

    Arranging urban youth to go to the countryside and running collective households is a relatively good form. It not only adapts to the characteristics of educated youth, facilitates unified arrangements for life, and facilitates centralized management and education, but also helps to play the role of the city as the "rear" for educated youth going to the countryside.

    We started running collective households for youth going to the countryside in 1962, and it developed greatly in 1964. The method is to pool the wisdom and efforts of everyone to run it together. In addition to participating in state-owned agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline, and fishery farms, newly-built teams, etc., factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, and streets in the city have also established 263 collective households for youth going to the countryside in rural areas. Collective households for youth going to the countryside have become the base point for various units in the city to arrange for youth going to the countryside.

    Although the running of collective households is mainly based on production teams, various units in the city are still responsible to the end, educating the youth going to the countryside, helping them arrange their lives, and providing necessary material support. Many collective households are led by cadres and teachers from the original units, and these leaders are rotated regularly. Some also regard the collective household as the labor base of their unit, sending cadres down to participate in labor training in turn, and assisting the commune and team in doing the work of the collective household. Some units also send leading cadres to the collective household to squat on the spot, and send teachers to the collective household regularly to help them study. By doing so, various units do not consider it an extra burden. The Second Middle School of the city regards the collective household as its "three bases": one is the settlement base, the second is the labor base, and the third is the education base. Every year, at a certain time, students are taken down to participate in agricultural production labor, visit the poor and ask about their suffering, and receive class education and labor education; or the youth going to the countryside there are invited back to give reports, use their own experiences to conduct education for students in the school, orienting them to go to the mountains and the countryside; and with the existing collective households as the base point, graduates of the school are gradually mobilized to settle here.

    Guiding Young People to the Countryside Requires Long-Term Arduous Work

    Managing urban youth, educating them, and guiding them to the countryside in a planned way is a very important task. Although we have done some work in recent years, it is just the beginning. The experience is insufficient, and some of those that have been established are not solid enough and have many problems. We need to further strengthen leadership. Therefore, in the future, we must focus on the following things:

    First, highlight politics and strengthen ideological leadership. We must unify the understanding of the whole party with Mao Zedong Thought, and make all comrades understand that managing and educating urban youth well, and guiding them to the countryside in a planned way, is a major event for us to compete with the bourgeoisie for the next generation, and is a long-term strategic task. At present, there are still sharp and complex class struggles in our country. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the next generation is an important aspect of the class struggle. If we do not adopt various methods to organize and educate young people, they will be corroded and influenced by bourgeois ideology. Therefore, managing and educating the younger generation well is a major issue related to cultivating proletarian revolutionary successors, carrying the socialist revolution through to the end, preventing the emergence of revisionism, and ensuring that our country does not change its color. At the same time, we must also realize that guiding urban youth to the countryside in a planned way is of great significance for promoting the development of agricultural production, building a new socialist countryside, strengthening the worker-peasant relationship, strengthening urban-rural mutual assistance, and gradually reducing the differences between mental and manual labor. Managing and educating urban youth well, and guiding them to the countryside in a planned way, is a new task. It not only involves the relatives of young people, but also involves rural commune members and grassroots cadres. We must carry out publicity and education work to the broad masses of urban and rural people, and make the important significance of managing and educating revolutionary successors well, orienting them towards the countryside, supporting agriculture, and supporting urban educated youth going to the countryside, known to every household, deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and form a healthy social public opinion.

    Second, firmly grasp implementation and further do a good job in consolidation and improvement. There are still many problems in the schools, labor reserve training centers, and especially the collective households for educated youth going to the countryside, which have already been established and oriented towards the countryside. It will take several years of effort to truly consolidate them. To do a good job in consolidation, the most important thing is to highlight politics, study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in a living way, resolutely implement the party's policies and policies, and strengthen ideological education work in a practical way. Schools that are semi-work (farming) semi-study, city-based and community-based, and that take into account both urban and rural areas, must resolutely implement the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Starting from facing the countryside, actively carry out teaching reforms, conscientiously read books, and work hard, so that students can learn the necessary agricultural production knowledge and skills and develop labor habits while they are in school, be able to endure hardship and hard work, and prepare for going to the mountains and the countryside. Labor reserve training centers must implement the direction of facing the countryside, strengthen leadership, and further solve problems such as learning, activity places, and labor bases. The consolidation of collective households requires arduous and meticulous work. On the one hand, we must strengthen ideological education for the youth going to the countryside; on the other hand, we must do everything possible to help them improve production, so that commune members and the youth going to the countryside can increase their income year by year, so that they can truly take root in the countryside.

    Third, work hard, be self-reliant, and run businesses diligently and thriftily. Chairman Mao said: "We must advocate building the country diligently and thriftily. We must make all young people understand that our country is still a very poor country now, and it is impossible to fundamentally change this state in a short period of time. It all depends on the unity and struggle of the youth and all the people over the decades, and creating a prosperous country with our own hands. The establishment of the socialist system has opened up a path for us to reach the ideal realm, and the realization of the ideal realm still depends on our hard work." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings in running schools, labor reserve training centers, and collective households, learn from the People's Liberation Army, learn from Daqing, and learn from the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai, rely on the masses, be self-reliant, strive for progress, and work hard. This is also a major issue of educating and cultivating the new generation with revolutionary spirit. This spirit is needed not only when starting a business and when conditions are poor, but also when it is established and when conditions are good.

    Fourth, strengthen leadership and make overall plans. Managing and educating urban youth, and guiding them to the countryside in a planned way, is a very complex task involving a wide range of aspects. Therefore, the Party Committee must strengthen leadership, designate special personnel to be responsible, discuss regularly, unify thinking, unify steps, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties. Various departments and units must divide their responsibilities, cooperate closely, and work together. In the work, we must also pay attention to overall planning, comprehensive arrangements, and combine the cultivation of talents for various rural construction projects, the placement of urban educated youth in the countryside, the development of agricultural production, the development of diversified management, and the planning of farmland capital construction. At present, we must conscientiously do some investigation and research, sum up experience, establish models, and discover and solve problems in a timely manner. Party committees at all levels must grasp this work tightly and practically, grasp it to the end, grasp it for several years, and grasp it for a long time. Take measures from all aspects and effectively manage and educate urban youth, and do a better job of guiding them to the countryside in a planned way. (Attached picture)

    有计划地把城市青少年导向农村
    ——长春市管理教育城市青少年的经验
    中共长春市委员会
    编者按　把城市青少年管好教好，有计划地把大部分青年导向农村，这不仅是培养教育革命后代的大事，对于建设社会主义新农村，对于加强工农联盟、加强城乡互助，对于逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别，都有重大的意义。
    近几年来，长春市采取多种形式，通过几条渠道，把城市青少年组织起来，给以良好的教育，组织他们上山下乡，参加农业生产劳动。他们采取的办法是：一、在农村试办半农半读的市来社去的学校，招收城市的学生，也招收农村的知识青年。这些学生既可以劳动，又可以读书，毕业以后就在当地参加生产劳动。通过几年的学习，他们学会了农业生产劳动，又有一定的文化、技术，农民欢迎，他们也安心生产。二、在城市试办市来社去、城乡兼顾的学校。这种学校办在城市，面向农村，经常组织学生参加农业生产劳动，培养青少年的劳动观点和劳动习惯，使他们学到一定的农业知识和生产技术，为将来上山下乡创造必要的条件。还有两种是在街道试办劳动后备讲习所，在农村公社生产大队建立下乡知识青年集体户。这也是把城市青少年导向农村的一条重要渠道。
    长春市对于下乡的知识青年，坚持负责到底，发挥了“后方”的作用，在政治思想、生活等方面给以极大的关怀，进行了许多工作。所有这些，都是值得各地参考的。
    新中国建国以来，随着工农业生产的发展，长春市的教育事业有了很大的发展。一九五六年普及了小学教育。以后，采取“两条腿走路”的办法，在发展国家办学和工厂企业办学的同时，又发动群众办学，使绝大部分高小毕业生都升了学。一九六四年以来，贯彻两种劳动制度、两种教育制度，试办了一批半工（农）半读学校，使城市中等教育又有了进一步的发展。但是，仍有一部分青少年没有升学和就业。面对这种情况，街道又办起了劳动后备讲习所，吸收一部分青少年参加学习和劳动。这样，把全市青少年大体上都组织起来了。
    把城市青年导向农村的几种办法
    现在的问题是，一方面怎样继续把青少年管好教好；另一方面除了为工厂企业培养劳动后备力量外，主要的是如何积极地把他们导向农村。根据几年来的摸索，我们大体上采取了以下几种办法：
    在城市办半农半读市来社去的学校
    这种学校现有三所，两所园艺学校，一所耕读中学，学生八百三十二人。从城市招生，毕业后往农村分配。
    举办面向农村，市来社去的学校，是管理教育城市青少年，并把他们导向农村的一个途径。如二道河子区一九六○年由八个集体所有制农场联合举办了一所园艺学校，六年来，共有毕业生一百二十九名，他们绝大部分都安心农业生产。现在，有的担任了生产队长和政治队长，有的担任了技术员、会计员、化验员，有的担任了生产队的毛主席著作学习辅导员，有的被选为五好社员和社员代表，不少人成为各项工作的骨干。在农业生产中，他们同老农一道，结合生产开展了科学试验，并取得了一定的成绩。技术推广站反映：园艺学校毕业生来了以后，科学试验项目多了，技术推广快了，农药用得好了。又如一九六四年创办的第一耕读中学，现有学生五百八十五名。学校经常向学生进行面向农村的思想教育，并有计划地组织他们参加农业生产和其他各种劳动。经过一年多的教育和劳动，学生的思想感情发生了很大变化。他们在劳动中，不怕脏不怕累，能吃苦耐劳。许多学生开始树立起以农为荣、立志务农的思想。这所学校，还加强了学生劳动技能的训练。去年，学校种了五百零四亩地，其中收获高粱、玉米等十六万斤。
    在农村办半农半读市来社去的学校
    这种学校现有三所，两所劳动大学，一所师范学校，共有学生一千七百三十四人。两所劳动大学是试验性质的。一所办在山区。一九六二年经省批准，在省、州有关部门的支持下，我们在延边朝鲜族自治州长白山区办了一个青年营林垦殖场，主要是安排城市知识青年劳动生产；一九六四年又在这里办了一所半农半读的林业垦殖技术学校；一九六五年改为长白山劳动大学，由延边朝鲜族自治州安图县领导，仍以招收我市高、初中毕业生为主。另一所是办在农村的农安耕读大学。这两所大学是为农村造就人材的基地，也是农业科学实验的基地。学校分别设有农学、林学、农机和畜牧兽医等专业。分本科和预科，招收高、初中毕业生。这两所大学和它的前身在创办中，除用国家部分补贴作为办学经费外，主要靠师生自己动手，开荒种地，劳动建校。它们虽然办在农村，但是同城市有密切联系。城市是它们的“后方”，从城市派干部、派教师，并从各方面来支援它们。
    劳动大学办在农村，同生产实际、同农民群众紧密结合，有利于改造思想，改革教学。同时，也为学生毕业后，留在农村创造了有利条件。长白山劳动大学学生杨孟强，一九六三年到青年营林垦殖场，开始认为在山沟里没有前途，很不安心。经过劳动锻炼，他的思想不断进步，入了团，被评为“五好青年”，当了水田队长，立志要改善山区水稻品种。一九六五年，他动员未婚妻也上了山。有的大学毕业生，在这里劳动实习后，志愿留下来担任教师。还有的教师，不但主动到这里来教书，当一名“志愿兵”，而且携带全家到山区安家落户。
    在城市办城乡兼顾的学校
    这种学校，现有九所，学生五千八百余人。这种兼顾城市和农村的学校，主要是面向农村，为农村培养新型劳动者。学生既参加工业劳动，又参加农业劳动。他们搞的工业，也主要是农村所需要的工业。学生毕业后，多数将到农村。初中性质的工读中学，都开设了农业基础知识课，通过劳动学到一些工农业生产技能。中等技术学校所设的专业，以及工业劳动的工种，如木工、瓦工、电工等，尽量照顾城乡通用。
    城乡兼顾的学校，经常加强面向农村，为农业生产服务的思想教育，定期地组织学生服务队到农村去，了解农村，熟悉农民，为贫下中农服务。第二工读中学，组织学木工和电工的学生，到郊区给社员打家具，安电灯。市建筑工程学校，组织师生到农村给贫下中农修理门窗、锅盖、风匣等，并给一位六十多岁的老贫农盖起三间房子。这位老贫农十分感动地说：“真是托毛主席的福，要是没有共产党和毛主席，我这一辈子也盖不起房子！”师生住在贫下中农家里，老贫农给他们讲家史，他们向社员宣传时事，给社员理发、担水等，还和社员一起参加劳动。他们既是劳动队，又是服务队，也是宣传队，不仅从中受到教育和锻炼，也丰富了专业知识，学会了农活。
    在街道办劳动后备讲习所
    把闲散的城市青年组织起来，采取有工做工，无工学习的办法，对他们进行管理教育，特别是进行上山下乡的教育，把他们导向农村。两年来，全市建立了三十个劳动后备讲习所，吸收了一批青年入所学习。经过学习和劳动，很多人已参加了农业生产。
    劳动后备讲习所以政治教育为主，辅以必要的文化知识和科学技术知识。同时，采取自办工厂、农场或与工厂企业、公社挂钩的办法，组织他们参加劳动，提高他们的阶级觉悟，学习劳动本领。学生以劳动的收入解决讲习所的必要经费，也使他们得到一定的生活补助。
    劳动后备讲习所在团结、教育、改造这些青年中起了很大作用。入所学习的人，多是闲散在街道上的青少年。经过讲习所的教育，现在大多数青年思想觉悟都有提高，一些染有恶习的人都有了显著的转变。把这些青年组织起来以后，他们成为街道工作中的一支积极力量。他们在居民学习毛主席著作、教育儿童、拥军优属、卫生工作和文娱活动中起到了积极的作用。他们出所参加工农业生产以后，大多数在生产劳动岗位上表现都比较好。
    在农村生产队建立下乡青年集体户
    安排城市青年下乡，办集体户是一种比较好的形式。它既适应知识青年的特点，便于统一安排生活，便于集中管理教育，又有利于发挥城市作为下乡青年的“后方”的作用。
    我们办下乡青年集体户，是从一九六二年开始的，一九六四年有了很大发展。方法是群策群力，大家来办。全市除通过参加国营农林牧副渔场、新建队等方法以外，各工厂企业、机关、学校、街道，在农村还办起了二百六十三个下乡青年集体户。下乡青年集体户已经成为城市各单位安排下乡青年的基点。
    办集体户虽以生产队为主，但城市各单位仍然负责到底，对下乡青年进行教育，帮助安排生活，给予必要的物质支援。不少集体户都是由原来单位的干部、教师带队下去的，这些带队的干部和教师定期轮换。有的还把集体户作为本单位的劳动基点，下放干部轮流参加劳动锻炼，协助社、队做好集体户的工作。有些单位还派领导干部到集体户去蹲点，派教师定期到集体户帮助他们学习。这样做，各单位并不认为是额外负担。市第二中学把集体户当作自己的“三个基地”：一是安置基地，二是劳动基地，三是教育基地。每年在一定时期，把学生带下去参加农业生产劳动，访贫问苦，接受阶级教育和劳动教育；或把那里的下乡青年请回来作报告，现身说法，向在校学生进行上山下乡的教育；并且以现有集体户为基点，陆续动员本校毕业生来这里落户。
    把青少年导向农村需要做长期艰苦的工作
    把城市青少年管理起来，进行教育，并且有计划地导向农村，是一项很重要的工作。近几年来，我们虽然做了一些工作，但还是刚刚开始，经验不足，已经办起来的有一些还不够巩固，存在不少问题，还要进一步加强领导。因此，今后必须大抓以下几件事：
    第一，突出政治，加强思想领导。要用毛泽东思想统一全党的认识，务使所有同志懂得把城市青少年管好教好，并有计划地导向农村，是我们同资产阶级争夺下一代的大事，是一项长期的战略任务。当前，我国还存在着尖锐、复杂的阶级斗争。无产阶级同资产阶级争夺下一代的斗争，就是阶级斗争的一个重要方面。如果我们不采取各种方式，把青少年组织起来，加以教育，他们就会受到资产阶级思想的腐蚀和影响。所以，管好教好青少年一代，这是关系到培养无产阶级革命接班人的大问题，关系到把社会主义革命进行到底，防止产生修正主义，保证我们国家不变颜色的大问题。同时，还要认识到，有计划地把城市青少年导向农村，对于促进农业生产的发展，建设社会主义新农村，密切工农关系，加强城乡互助，逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的差别，都有重要意义。管好教好城市青少年，并有计划地把他们导向农村，这是一项新的工作，它不仅涉及青少年的亲属，也涉及农村社员和基层干部，必须向城乡广大群众进行宣传教育工作，把管好教好革命后代，面向农村，支援农业，支持城市知识青年下乡的重要意义，作到家喻户晓，深入人心，形成健康的社会舆论。
    第二，狠抓落实，进一步做好巩固提高工作。已经办起来的面向农村的学校、劳动后备讲习所，特别是下乡知识青年集体户，还存在不少问题。要真正巩固下来，需要经过几年的努力。做好巩固工作，最主要的是要突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻党的方针政策，把思想教育工作切实地加强起来。半工（农）半读的市来社去、城乡兼顾的学校，必须坚决贯彻执行教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，从面向农村出发，积极进行教学改革，作到认真读书，认真劳动，使学生在校期间就能学到必要的农业生产知识和技能，养成劳动习惯，能够吃苦耐劳，做好上山下乡的准备。劳动后备讲习所要贯彻面向农村的方向，加强领导，进一步解决学习、活动场所和劳动基地等问题。集体户的巩固，需要做艰苦细致的工作。一方面，要对下乡青年加强思想教育；另一方面，要千方百计地帮助他们把生产搞上去，使社员和下乡青年都能逐年增加收入，使他们在农村真正扎下根来。
    第三，艰苦奋斗、自力更生、勤俭办事业。毛主席说：“要提倡勤俭建国。要使全体青年们懂得，我们的国家现在还是一个很穷的国家，并且不可能在短时间内根本改变这种状态，全靠青年和全体人民在几十年时间内，团结奋斗，用自己的双手创造出一个富强的国家。社会主义制度的建立给我们开辟了一条到达理想境界的道路，而理想境界的实现还要靠我们的辛勤劳动。”我们办学校、劳动后备讲习所、集体户，都必须遵循毛主席的教导，学习解放军，学习大庆，学习大寨的革命精神，依靠群众，自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦创业。这也是用革命精神教育培养新一代的大问题。这种精神，不仅在创办的时候和条件差的时候需要这样做，就是在办起来以后和条件好的时候也要坚持这样做。
    第四，加强领导，统筹规划。管理教育城市青少年，并有计划地把他们导向农村，是一件非常复杂的工作，涉及的方面很广。因此党委必须加强领导，指定专人负责，定期讨论，统一思想，统一步调，充分调动各方面的积极性。各部门、各单位要分工负责，通力合作。在工作中还必须注意统筹规划，全面安排，把培养农村各项建设人材，安置城市知识青年下乡和发展农业生产，搞好多种经营以及农田基本建设等规划结合起来。当前要认真地做一些调查研究，总结经验，树立样板，及时地发现问题，解决问题。各级党委要把这项工作抓紧抓实，一抓到底，狠抓几年，长期抓下去，从各方面采取措施，切实把管理教育城市青少年，并有计划地把他们导向农村这项工作做得更好。（附图片）
