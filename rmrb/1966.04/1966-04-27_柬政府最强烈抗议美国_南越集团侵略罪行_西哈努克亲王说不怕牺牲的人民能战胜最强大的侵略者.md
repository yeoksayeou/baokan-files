    According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 24th: The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on the 23rd, most strongly protesting the premeditated and arbitrary aggression against Cambodia by the US-Saigon puppet clique on April 15th and 18th, which killed and wounded many Cambodian soldiers and civilians. The statement demanded that the US-Saigon authorities must bear full responsibility for this.

    The statement urged all peace-loving and just countries to immediately take necessary measures to stop the US-South Vietnamese puppet clique from committing similar crimes again.

    Members of the Cambodian International Commission for Supervision and Control, military attachés of foreign embassies in Phnom Penh, and foreign journalists, at the invitation of the Royal Government of Cambodia, conducted an on-the-spot investigation of the aforementioned incidents on April 20th.

    On the evening of April 18th, about 50 US-South Vietnamese puppet troops infiltrated Cambodian territory and attacked a Cambodian provincial defense army post in the Kirirom area of Takeo Province, 600 meters from the border. The invaders harassed the post for 25 minutes, killing one villager and wounding three provincial defense soldiers and eight villagers before retreating.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 24th: Cambodian Head of State Prince Sihanouk said on the morning of the 24th at a ceremony to present gifts to the South Vietnam National Liberation Front: Cambodia has received the support of the South Vietnamese brothers united around the South Vietnam National Liberation Front in the struggle against the aggression of US imperialism and its running dogs. "They have shown us, and all countries of the world, that a people who are not afraid of all sacrifices are able to defeat the most powerful and cruel aggressors."

    Tran Buu Kiem, representative of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, accepted the gifts.

    Prince Sihanouk said: "I am very happy to be able to receive today the delegation of our heroic brothers of South Vietnam, led by my friend Mr. Tran Buu Kiem."

    He said: "We Cambodians are also suffering from the aggression and escalation of war launched by our common enemy."

    Prince Sihanouk pointed out that the US imperialists and their puppets are very dissatisfied with Cambodia's firm resistance to their attempts to satellitize it, and its unwavering support for the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Laotian brothers. Therefore, "the armed forces of Bangkok and a handful of 'Free Khmer' traitors, funded, armed, and directed by the United States, have forced us for several months to accept a localized war in the border areas of Koh Kong Province, Oddar Meanchey Province, and Preah Vihear Province."

    "As Chairman Nguyen Huu Tho pointed out in a recent letter, Cambodia is paying an increasingly heavy price in blood for our common cause, because not a day goes by that we Cambodians do not lose lives in the fight against the aggressors. I can assure you that we are also prepared to make this contribution to defend the honor of our country, and to prove to those Asian traitors who have sold themselves to foreign imperialists that they cannot save their masters from defeat, and cannot stop the emergence of an independent, free, and prosperous Asia."

    柬政府最强烈抗议美国—南越集团侵略罪行
    西哈努克亲王说不怕牺牲的人民能战胜最强大的侵略者
    据新华社金边二十四日电柬埔寨王国政府二十三日发表声明，最强烈地抗议美国—西贡傀儡集团在四月十五日和十八日对柬埔寨进行预谋的恣意侵略，打死、打伤许多柬埔寨军民。声明要求美国—西贡当局必须对此负全部责任。
    声明敦请一切爱好和平和正义的国家立即采取必要措施，制止美国—南越傀儡集团再次发生类似的罪行。
    柬埔寨国际监察和监督委员会委员、外国驻金边使馆的武官和外国记者，应柬埔寨王国政府邀请，四月二十日对上述事件进行了实地调查。
    四月十八日晚间，约有五十名美国—南越伪军潜入柬埔寨境内，袭击离边界六百米的茶胶省基里翁地区的柬埔寨省防军哨所。侵略者骚扰这个哨所达二十五分钟之久，他们在撤退前，打死一个村民、打伤三名省防军和八个村民。
    据新华社金边二十四日电柬埔寨国家元首西哈努克亲王二十四日上午在向越南南方民族解放阵线赠送礼品的仪式上说：柬埔寨在反对美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略的斗争中得到了团结在越南南方民族解放阵线周围的南越兄弟的支持，“他们向我们、也向全世界所有国家表明，不怕一切牺牲的人民是能够战胜最强大、最残酷的侵略者的。”
    越南南方民族解放阵线的代表陈宝剑接受了礼品。
    西哈努克亲王说：“我非常高兴，今天能够接待由我的朋友陈宝剑先生率领的我们越南南方英雄的兄弟的代表团。”
    他说：“我们柬埔寨也受到了我们的共同敌人所发动的侵略和战争的逐步升级之害。”
    西哈努克亲王指出，美帝国主义者及其傀儡对柬埔寨坚决抵制他们把它卫星化的企图，和坚定不移地支持中国兄弟、越南兄弟和老挝兄弟十分不满。因此，“曼谷的武装部队和由美国资助、武装和指挥的一小撮‘自由高棉’叛徒，迫使我们几个月以来在戈公省、奥多棉藏省和帕威夏省边境地区接受一场局部性的战争。
    “正如阮友寿主席在最近一封信中所指出的，柬埔寨用鲜血对我们的共同事业付出了越来越大的代价，因为没有一天我们柬埔寨人不在反对侵略者的战斗中丧失生命。我可以向你保证，我们还准备做出这种贡献，来捍卫我国的荣誉，并且向那些卖身投靠给外国帝国主义者的亚洲叛徒证明，他们是不能使他们的主子免遭失败的，是不能阻挡一个独立的、自由的和繁荣的亚洲的出现的。”
