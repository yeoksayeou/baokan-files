    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 14th -- The five individual events of the 1966 National Table Tennis Championships entered their final stage today. Players from all over the country displayed high sportsmanship and skill in the matches vying for the top two spots in the men's and women's singles, the top four in mixed doubles, and the top eight in men's and women's doubles. Their superb skills and tenacious fighting spirit frequently drew enthusiastic applause and cheers from the audience.
    Men's singles world champion Zhuang Zedong from Beijing and world runner-up Li Furong from Shanghai, as well as Guangdong's famous player Liang Lizhen and Shanxi's chopping specialist Qiu Baoqin, entered the top two in the men's and women's singles today. They will compete for the national men's and women's singles championships in the finals tomorrow night. Women's doubles world champions Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi from Shanghai were eliminated by Zhou Yiling and Hu Xincheng, Shanghai attackers who use a straight grip, by a score of 0-3 in the competition for the top eight in women's doubles tonight.
    Zhuang Zedong and Li Furong both defeated Shanghai's straight-grip chopping specialist Zhang Xielin and right-handed penhold chopping newcomer Yao Zhenxu by a score of 3-1 tonight to advance to the finals. Zhang Xielin and Yao Zhenxu tied for third place in the men's singles.
    Zhang Xielin and the nineteen-year-old Yao Zhenxu both played very well tonight. Not only did they chop steadily, but they also frequently launched sudden attacks to score points. In the matches to compete for the top four, they defeated Guizhou's famous player Wang Jiasheng and Shanxi's master Zhou Lansun by scores of 3-2 and 3-1 respectively. In the match between Zhang Xielin and Wang Jiasheng, Zhang lost the first two games but then won three consecutive games to reverse the defeat. The final point of the last game was a thrilling moment that caused a sensation throughout the entire venue: Wang Jiasheng was forced to play high balls far from the table under Zhang Xielin's fierce attack. Zhang Xielin leaped up and smashed three times, Wang Jiasheng desperately tried to save the ball but unfortunately fell down and lost the final game 19-21.
    After defeating Shanghai's Yu Yize 3-0 in the competition for the top four, Zhuang Zedong then faced Zhang Xielin. The two sides fought fiercely for four games, and Zhuang Zedong finally won and entered the finals. Before entering the top four, Li Furong had defeated Guangdong's Lu Jufang 3-0.
    The two women's singles matches to compete for the top two spots were unprecedentedly fierce. Liang Lizhen and Qiu Baoqin both went through five grueling games before defeating Shanghai's chopping specialist Zheng Minzhi and last year's national runner-up Li Henan, who is good at looping, by a score of 3-2 to secure their place in the finals. Zheng Minzhi and Li Henan tied for third place in the women's singles.
    These two matches between offense and defense are considered to be of world-class level, and all four players displayed their full skills. Liang Lizhen swung her arm and powerfully smashed the ball accurately in the fifth game, finally defeating Zheng Minzhi 21-15 to secure her place in the finals. In the deciding game, Qiu Baoqin repeatedly chopped back Li Henan's powerful spinning loop almost grazing the net, and finally won 21-16.
    Before these two matches, Qiu Baoqin defeated last year's national champion Lin Huiqing from Shanghai 3-0; Li Henan eliminated Li Li from Beijing 3-2; Liang Lizhen won against Shi Fengling from Beijing 3-1; and Zheng Minzhi defeated Di Qianghua from Jiangsu 3-0.
    After the fourth and fifth rounds of the mixed doubles competition, the remaining four winning pairs will compete for the finals tomorrow morning. The matchups for tomorrow are: Zhuang Zedong and Liang Lizhen against Li Furong and Li Li, Wang Jiasheng and Li Henan against Li Deyang (Liaoning) and Qiu Baoqin. Among them, Wang Jiasheng and Li Henan, and Li Deyang and Qiu Baoqin are not seeded players. Wang Jiasheng and Li Henan eliminated the fourth seed, Yu Changchun and Zhou Yiling from Shanghai, 3-1 in the fourth round. Li Deyang and Qiu Baoqin entered the top four after defeating Yu Yize and Di Qianghua 3-2 in the fifth round.
    The matchups for the eight pairs of players who entered the top eight in men's doubles in the fifth round tomorrow are: Zhou Qian and Gong Baohua (Jiangsu) against Lu Jufang and Xu Shaofa (Jilin), Yu Yize and Wang Fucheng (Jiangsu) against Li Furong and Wang Jiasheng, Zhou Lansun and Yu Changchun (Shanghai) against Li Deyang and Li Lianyi (Guangdong), Diao Wenyuan (Anhui) and He Zubin (Hubei) against Zhuang Zedong and Li Jingguang (Hebei).

    全国乒乓球锦标赛进入最后阶段
    庄则栋、李富荣和梁丽珍、仇宝琴将分别争夺男、女单打冠军
    新华社上海十四日电　一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛的五个单项比赛今天进入最后阶段。各地选手在争夺进入男、女单打前两名、混合双打前四名和男、女双打前八名的比赛中，打出了高风格、高水平，他们的高超球艺和顽强的战斗意志，不时激起观众热烈的掌声和喝采声。
    男子单打世界冠军、北京的庄则栋和世界亚军、上海的李富荣，以及广东名将梁丽珍和山西削球好手仇宝琴，今天进入了男、女单打的前两名，他们将在明晚举行的决赛中，争夺男、女单打全国冠军。女子双打世界冠军、上海的林慧卿和郑敏之，今晚在争夺进入女子双打前八名的比赛中，以○比三被上海直握球拍的攻击手周一玲和胡新成所淘汰。
    庄则栋和李富荣今晚以三比一的同样比数，分别淘汰了上海直握球拍的削球名将张燮林和右手横握球拍的削球新手姚振绪，进入决赛。张燮林和姚振绪并列男子单打的第三名。
    张燮林和十九岁的姚振绪今晚都打得很出色，他们不仅削得稳，而且经常突然起板猛扣得分，在争夺进入前四名的比赛中，曾经分别以三比二和三比一的比数，淘汰了贵州名将王家声和山西名手周兰荪。张燮林在对王家声的比赛中先输两局，又连扳三局反败为胜。这场比赛在最后一局赢得最后一分时，曾经出现了使全场为之轰动的精采场面：王家声在张燮林的强攻下被迫远离球台放高球，张燮林跃起猛扣三大板，王家声顽强抢救不慎摔倒，才以十九比二十一输掉这最后一局。
    庄则栋在争夺进入前四名的比赛中，以三比○淘汰了上海的于贻泽以后，接着又同张燮林对垒，双方激战四局，庄则栋终于获胜，进入决赛。李富荣在进入前四名以前曾经以三比○赢了广东的陆巨芳。
    女子单打争夺进入前两名的两场比赛空前激烈，梁丽珍和仇宝琴都经过五局苦战，才以三比二的同样比数分别淘汰了上海的削球名手郑敏之和去年全国亚军、善于拉弧圈球的李赫男，取得决赛权。郑敏之和李赫男并列女子单打第三名。
    这两场攻守大战被认为是具有世界水平的比赛，四名选手都施展了全身功夫。梁丽珍在第五局挥臂大板扣杀又狠又准，以二十一比十五最后战胜了郑敏之，取得决赛权。仇宝琴在决胜局一次又一次地几乎擦着球网削回了李赫男的强力旋转的弧圈球，最后以二十一比十六获得胜利。
    在这两场比赛之前，仇宝琴以三比○战胜了去年全国冠军、上海的林慧卿；李赫男以三比二淘汰了北京的李莉；梁丽珍以三比一赢了北京的石凤玲；郑敏之以三比○打败了江苏的狄蔷华。
    混合双打经过第四轮和第五轮比赛后，剩下的四对优胜者将在明天上午争夺决赛权。明天的对阵形势是：庄则栋和梁丽珍对李富荣和李莉、王家声和李赫男对李德洋（辽宁）和仇宝琴。其中王家声和李赫男、李德洋和仇宝琴都不是种子选手。王家声和李赫男曾经在第四轮以三比一淘汰了第四号种子上海的余长春和周一玲。李德洋和仇宝琴是在第五轮以三比二淘汰了于贻泽和狄蔷华以后，进入前四名的。
    今天男子双打进入前八名的八对选手在明天第五轮比赛中的对阵形势是：周前和龚宝华（江苏）对陆巨芳和许绍发（吉林）、于贻泽和王福成（江苏）对李富荣和王家声、周兰荪和余长春（上海）对李德洋和李联益（广东）、刁文元（安徽）和何祖斌（湖北）对庄则栋和李景光（河北）。
