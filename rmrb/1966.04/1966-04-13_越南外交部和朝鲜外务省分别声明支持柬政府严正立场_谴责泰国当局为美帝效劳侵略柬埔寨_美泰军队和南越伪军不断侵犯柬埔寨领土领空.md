    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 12th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on the 11th, condemning the Thai authorities for sending troops to attack and occupy the Cambodian Longvek Pagoda, an act of aggression.

    The statement pointed out that this criminal act by the Thai authorities is actively serving the U.S. imperialists' conspiracy to invade Cambodia and expand the war to the entire Indochina.

    The statement said that the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly condemns the aforementioned aggressive actions by the Thai authorities and firmly demands that they immediately cease their criminal activities of serving the U.S. imperialists' aggressive schemes.

    The statement said that the government and people of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the solemn position as elucidated in the statement issued by the Royal Government of Cambodia on April 7th this year.

    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 12th: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on the 12th, resolutely condemning the Thai reactionaries for intensifying their aggression against Cambodia recently under the direction of U.S. imperialism.

    The statement said that the Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on April 7th, condemning the aggressive acts of the Thai troops. The Korean government and people fully support the solemn claims made by the Royal Government of Cambodia in the statement.

    The statement said that the Korean government and people strongly demand that U.S. imperialism and the Thai reactionaries must immediately cease all acts of aggression against Cambodian territory, and express militant solidarity with the struggle of the Cambodian government and people against the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

    The statement concluded by saying that the righteous struggle of the Cambodian people who are rising up against aggression is receiving the full support and sympathy of peace-loving people around the world. If U.S. imperialism and its running dogs continue to carry out foolish provocative acts against Cambodian territory and expand this aggression, then they will inevitably suffer an even more shameful and miserable defeat.

    Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, April 11th: According to a report by the Cambodian News Agency, on the morning of April 9th, two "Skyraider" aircraft of the U.S.-Thai troops repeatedly intruded into the airspace over the Longvek Pagoda positions in Cambodia. The Cambodian defenders fired at the two aircraft, forcing them to immediately fly back into Thai airspace. At the same time, the Thai troops stationed in front of the Cambodian positions fired at the Cambodian positions for a long time. Cambodian soldiers retaliated.

    On the same day, Thai troops also fired shells at a Cambodian helicopter that landed on Longvek Pagoda Mountain.

    On the evening of April 6th, Cambodian soldiers exchanged fire with Thai troops who invaded Koh Kong Province, driving the Thais back to the other side of the border.

    According to another report from the news agency, on the morning of April 8th, a team of about fifty U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet troops invaded Cambodian territory in Svay Rieng Province and fired at Cambodian border patrols. The Cambodian patrols were surrounded by enemies who were superior in number and weapons, and were forced to retreat after a brief exchange of fire. In this blatant act of aggression, two Cambodians were killed.

    On March 28th and 30th, U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet army aircraft violated Cambodian airspace in Kampong Cham Province and Svay Rieng Province five times.
