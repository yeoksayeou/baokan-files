    How Balibao Street is Piloting the Labor Reserve Training Institute
    Communist Party of China Changchun City Erdaohezi District Committee Work Group
    Why Establish a Labor Reserve Training Institute
    Balibao is a street in Erdaohezi District, Changchun City. In early 1964, we did not keep up with the management and education of urban youth in a timely manner, and class enemies took the opportunity to launch a fierce struggle with us for the youth. Some young people were influenced and corrupted by bourgeois ideology, which seriously affected their healthy growth.
    Faced with this situation, there was an urgent need to organize these young people through certain forms. In May 1964, according to the instructions of the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees on strengthening youth education, under the direct leadership of the District Party Committee, Balibao Street began to organize out-of-school youths and established a youth study class. In August, a counselor class was established, with 94 students, who studied while doing children's counseling work. Soon, young people were also organized to form a study and labor brigade. By February 1965, everyone felt that it would be better to run a labor reserve training institute, so they merged the youth class, counselor class, and labor brigade to establish the Labor Reserve Training Institute.
    Over the past year, the Labor Reserve Training Institute has gradually developed and improved. A total of more than 480 urban youths (including graduates who did not go on to further education or employment in 1965) and 44 teenagers have participated in the study, of which 255 young people have successively left the institute to participate in industrial and agricultural production. Currently, there are still 249 young people and 21 teenagers studying and working in the institute.
    Creating Conditions for Planned Labor Employment
    The Labor Reserve Training Institute not only plays an active role in uniting and educating young people to take the road of labor and revolutionization, but also provides favorable conditions for planned employment, and also assists the street in doing a lot of work.
    Through the education and labor training of the training institute, the class consciousness of the youth has been raised, the erosion of bourgeois ideology has been resisted, and the mental outlook of most of the youth has changed. Many young people actively demand progress politically, their revolutionary spirit has been greatly boosted, and many vivid examples of backwardness turning into progress have emerged. Bai Guosheng, an 18-year-old youth, had bad habits since he was a child. After entering the institute, through education and labor training, his thinking has made great progress, and he regretted his past mistakes. At a study meeting, he cried and said, "Thanks to the Party for saving me, I will definitely listen to the Party and be a good child of Chairman Mao." Since then, he has not only been enthusiastic about studying and actively working, but also done a lot of good things for the collective. He never spent his labor remuneration in the institute indiscriminately, and gave it all to his parents. In October 1964, after democratic appraisal, he was introduced to a factory as an apprentice, and he has been performing very well since then. Gong Yuxi, a 23-year-old, loved to eat, be lazy, and pay attention to food and clothing before coming to the institute. After coming to the training institute, after education, especially through the study of the two articles "Serving the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," he took the initiative to examine his bad thoughts and bad habits. He said, "I want to seriously correct my mistakes, and I want to be a real person, a noble person, and a pure person as Chairman Mao said." Later, he was assigned to a factory as an apprentice and performed very well. Now 36 people in the institute have been rated as "Five-Good Students," and 180 people have applied to join the Communist Youth League, and 43 people have joined the League. The transformation and progress of these young people have created a good political influence in the society. The broad masses and parents praised the Labor Reserve Training Institute for doing a good job, saying that this is the care of the Party and the government for the youth. After Bai Guosheng's transformation, his father was very moved and said to everyone he met, "It was the Communist Party and Chairman Mao who saved my child."
    The Labor Reserve Training Institute has created conditions for planned employment, especially for arranging for young people to go to the countryside. In the past, on the streets, there was often recruitment of workers on one hand and mobilization of young people to go to the countryside on the other, resulting in both aspects of the work being very passive. After the establishment of the Labor Reserve Training Institute, going to the mountains and countryside and labor force allocation were all arranged by the Labor Reserve Training Institute in a unified manner. In the allocation of students, according to the needs of industrial and agricultural production and construction, the method of democratic appraisal and organizational approval was adopted, and a comprehensive measurement was made based on the youth's ideology, labor performance and physical condition, as well as family circumstances, and reasonable arrangements were made. In this way, the arrangement of youth employment is closely linked with the needs of industrial and agricultural production and construction. The Labor Reserve Training Institute has successively sent a group of people to the industrial and agricultural fronts. Among the young people who went to the countryside, the vast majority of them were at ease in rural labor, and some of them also served as deputy secretaries of the brigade Communist Youth League branch, storekeepers, statisticians, and teachers of farming-study primary schools.
    The establishment of the Labor Reserve Training Institute has promoted the development of street work. Organizing young people has become an active force on the streets. The children's activity station on the street is organized by the counselor class of the Labor Reserve Training Institute. At present, there are more than 800 preschool children participating in the children's activity station on the street. Some young people also serve as tutors for residents to study Chairman Mao's works. The students of the Labor Reserve Training Institute participate in various tasks on the street, such as general elections, support for the army and preferential treatment for military families, and hygiene. These young people also cooperate with political movements to perform various entertainment programs for street residents, enlivening the political and cultural life of street residents.
    A Good Way to Manage and Educate Urban Youth
    How to run a Labor Reserve Training Institute? At the beginning, the thinking was not clear enough. Through practice, continuous summary, and some ways were found. Now it seems that the Labor Reserve Training Institute is one of the better forms of managing and educating urban youth and cultivating labor reserve forces. The main practices of Balibao Street are:
    Putting ideological and political education first. Ideological and political education work has adhered to Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, taking class struggle as the key, educating young people to raise their class consciousness, enhance their ability to resist the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and promote them to go to the mountains and countryside, obey the needs of the state, and take the road of revolutionization and labor. The main content and methods of ideological and political education are: First, organize young people to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in a lively manner, as the main and regular political education course. When studying, the main thing is to study with questions in mind. When conducting class education for young people, they are organized to deeply study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society"; when mobilizing young people to go to the mountains and countryside, they are organized to study "The Orientation of the Youth Movement"; when mobilizing young people to build houses for the Labor Reserve Training Institute by themselves, they are organized to study "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Many young people have drawn wisdom and strength from Chairman Mao's works, their thinking has improved, and their political direction has become clear. Second, carry out class education through various forms. At the beginning of 1965, when the Labor Reserve Training Institute was just established, it took more than two months to conduct centralized education on class and class struggle for young people. Later, in response to their fear of dirt, fear of fatigue, and fear of hardship, their ideas of enjoying ease and hating work, and their vague class views, they successively organized young people to read and discuss more than 20 typical materials on class education, invited "Five Olds" (old workers, old poor peasants, old cadres, old Red Army soldiers, old models) to report on family history, child labor history, and revolutionary struggle history, and also organized young people to visit the Class Education Exhibition Hall, etc. Third, in response to the problems of some young people not observing discipline, not cherishing public property, and not being polite, moral education was carried out. Fourth, organize young people to learn from advanced figures, establish their own models, and carry out lively ideological education. They were also organized to learn from Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and the advanced deeds of educated youth who went to the countryside, seize the good people and good deeds that emerged in the institute, establish models, and carry out publicity and commendation, so that many young people strengthened their confidence in self-transformation and promoted everyone's common progress. Fifth, carry out the "Five-Good Students" evaluation activity with good ideology and morality, good study, good labor, good unity and mutual assistance, and good collective activities as the content. In the two general evaluations in 1965, about 15% of the people were rated as "Five-Good Students" each time, which also played a great role in encouraging and promoting the progress of young people.
    Organize young people to participate in physical labor and conduct labor education. Some of their participation in labor is profitable, and some is participation in social public welfare labor. Through labor, not only has the labor concept and labor habits of young people been cultivated, and some production skills have been learned, but also the students have obtained a certain income.
    In order to cultivate the social work ability of young people and establish the idea of serving the people, they are also organized to participate in some social work in a planned way for practical training.
    While carrying out ideological and political education and labor education, according to the needs of youth employment in the future, some cultural courses and professional basic courses are also offered. The cultural courses mainly teach Chinese and mathematics; the professional basic courses mainly teach rural accounting and basic agricultural knowledge.
    According to the characteristics of young people, combined with learning and labor, carry out cultural and sports activities.
    Self-Reliance, Diligence and Frugality in Running the Institute
    In the early days of the establishment of the Labor Reserve Training Institute, all activities were carried out in the open air and in temporarily borrowed clubs. Later, more and more young people participated in the Labor Reserve Training Institute, and the institute had accumulated a certain amount of money. Therefore, with the help of various units, all teachers and students were mobilized to build 17 simple houses in more than a month, and a fixed activity place was established, which basically met the needs of centralized activities. The Labor Reserve Training Institute has only two full-time teachers, and the rest of the teachers are part-time, acting or selected from the students. The equipment of the Labor Reserve Training Institute, everything that teachers and students can solve by themselves will not be bought, if there are old ones, they will not buy new ones, and if they must be used, they will also adhere to the spirit of diligence and frugality, and try to spend less money and do more things. Up to now, teachers and students have made 72 sets of simple tables and chairs by themselves, purchased more than 1,500 books, and more than 30 pieces of large and small production tools.
    Balibao Street's trial of the Labor Reserve Training Institute is less than two years old. Since this is a new job and lacks experience, there are still many shortcomings in the work, especially the ideological education facing the countryside is not enough. The District Party Committee is further strengthening leadership and improving the work of the Labor Reserve Training Institute. (Attached picture)

    八里堡街是怎样试办劳动后备讲习所的
    中共长春市二道河子区委工作组
    为什么要建立劳动后备讲习所
    八里堡是长春市二道河子区的一个街道。一九六四年初，我们对城市青少年的管理教育工作没有及时跟上，阶级敌人趁机而入，同我们展开了争夺青少年的激烈的斗争。有些青少年受到资产阶级思想的影响和腐蚀，严重地影响了他们的健康成长。
    面对这种情况，迫切需要通过一定的形式把这些青少年组织起来。一九六四年五月，根据省、市委关于加强青少年教育的指示，在区委的直接领导下，八里堡街开始把没有上学的少年组织起来，成立了一个少年学习班。八月份，又成立了一个辅导员班，学员有九十四人，她们一面进行学习，一面做儿童辅导工作。不久，又把青年也组织起来，成立了学习、劳动大队。到一九六五年二月，大家感到还是办劳动后备讲习所好，所以把少年班、辅导员班、劳动大队合并，成立了劳动后备讲习所。
    一年多来，劳动后备讲习所逐步得到了发展和提高。先后共组织城市青年四百八十多人（包括一九六五年没有升学就业的毕业生），少年四十四人参加了学习，其中有二百五十五名青年陆续出所参加了工农业生产。现在在所学习、劳动的青年还有二百四十九人，少年二十一人。
    为有计划地安置劳
    动就业创造条件
    劳动后备讲习所不仅在团结教育青少年走劳动化、革命化道路方面起着积极的作用，同时也为有计划地安置就业提供了有利条件，并且协助街道做了不少工作。
    经过讲习所的教育和劳动锻炼，提高了青少年阶级觉悟，抵制了资产阶级思想的侵蚀，使大多数青少年的精神面貌发生了变化。许多青少年在政治上积极要求进步，革命精神大为振作，出现了不少落后变先进的生动事例。十八岁的青年白国生，从小就染有不良习惯。入所后经过教育和劳动锻炼，他思想上有了很大的进步，悔悟了过去的错误。在一次学习会上，他痛哭流涕地说：“多亏党救了我，今后一定听党的话，做毛主席的好孩子。”从此，他不仅热心学习，积极劳动，还为集体做了不少好事。他在所内得到的劳动报酬，从不乱花，全部交给了家长。一九六四年十月，经过民主评议，介绍他到工厂当了学徒工，至今一直表现很好。二十三岁的宫玉喜，来所前好吃懒做、讲吃讲穿。到讲习所以后，经过教育，特别是通过《为人民服务》和《纪念白求恩》两篇文章的学习，他主动检查了自己的坏思想、坏作风。他说：“我要认真地改正错误，要象毛主席说的那样，做一个真正的人，高尚的人，纯粹的人。”后来他被分配到工厂当了学徒工，表现很好。现在全所有三十六人被评为“五好学员”，有一百八十人申请入团，已有四十三人入了团。这些青少年的转变和进步，在社会上造成了良好的政治影响，广大群众和家长都称赞劳动后备讲习所办的好，说这是党和政府对青年的关怀。白国生转变以后，他的父亲十分感动，逢人就说：“是共产党、毛主席救了我的孩子。”
    劳动后备讲习所，为有计划地安排就业、特别是安排青年下乡创造了条件。过去在街道上常常是一面招工，一面动员青年下乡，结果两方面工作都很被动。劳动后备讲习所成立之后，上山下乡和劳动力调配，都由劳动后备讲习所统筹安排。在学员分配上，按着工农业生产建设的需要，采取民主评议，组织批准的办法，根据青年的思想、劳动表现和身体条件以及家庭状况，进行全面衡量，做出合理安排。这样就把安排青年就业和工农业生产建设的需要密切结合起来。劳动后备讲习所已先后输送一批人到工农业战线上去。在下乡的青年中，绝大多数都安心在农村劳动，有一部分人还担任了大队团支部副书记、保管员、统计员、耕读小学教师等工作。
    劳动后备讲习所的建立，推动了街道工作的开展。把青少年组织起来，成为街道上的一支积极力量。街道的儿童活动站，就是劳动后备讲习所的辅导员班举办的。目前参加街道儿童活动站的学龄前儿童已达八百多人。还有部分青年做了居民学习毛主席著作的辅导员。街道上的各项工作，如普选、拥军优属、卫生等工作，都有劳动后备讲习所的学员参加。这些青年还配合政治运动为街道居民演出各种文娱节目，活跃了街道居民的政治生活和文化生活。
    管理教育城市青年的一种好形式
    怎样办劳动后备讲习所？在开始的时候思想是不够明确的。通过实践，不断总结，摸到了一些门路。现在看来，劳动后备讲习所是管理教育城市青年，培养劳动后备力量的较好的形式之一。八里堡街的主要作法是：
    把思想政治教育摆在首位。思想政治教育工作，坚持了毛泽东思想挂帅，以阶级斗争为纲，教育青年提高阶级觉悟，增强抵制资产阶级思想侵蚀的能力，促使他们上山下乡，服从国家需要，走革命化、劳动化的道路。进行思想政治教育的主要内容和方法是：一、把组织青年活学活用毛主席著作，作为主要的经常的政治教育课程。学习时，主要是带着问题学。当对青年进行阶级教育的时候，就组织他们深入地学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》；在动员青年上山下乡的时候，就组织他们学习《青年运动的方向》；在动员青年自己动手修筑劳动后备讲习所用房的时候，就组织他们学习《愚公移山》。许多青年从毛主席著作中吸取了智慧和力量，思想变好了，政治方向明确了。二、通过各种形式进行阶级教育。一九六五年初，劳动后备讲习所刚办起来的时候，用了两个多月的时间，集中地对青年进行了阶级和阶级斗争的教育。以后，针对他们的怕脏、怕累、怕苦的好逸恶劳思想和阶级观点模糊等问题，又先后组织青年阅读和讨论了二十多篇有关阶级教育的典型材料，请“五老”（老工人、老贫农、老干部、老红军、老模范）做家史、童工史、革命斗争史的报告，还组织青年参观阶级教育展览馆等。三、针对一些青少年不守纪律、不爱护公物、不讲礼貌等问题，进行了品德教育。四、组织青年学习先进人物，树立自己的样板，进行活的思想教育。还组织他们学习雷锋、王杰和下乡知识青年的先进事迹，抓住所内涌现出来的好人好事，树立样板，进行宣传和表扬，使很多青年加强了自我改造的信心，推动了大家共同进步。五、开展以思想品德好、学习好、劳动好、团结互助好、集体活动好为内容的“五好学员”评比活动。一九六五年两次总评，每次都有百分之十五左右的人被评为“五好学员”，这对鼓励和推动青年的进步也起了很大作用。
    组织青少年参加体力劳动，进行劳动教育。他们参加劳动，有的是有收益的，有的是参加社会公益劳动。通过劳动，不但培养了青少年的劳动观念和劳动习惯，学会了一些生产技能，而且也使学员个人得到一定的收入。
    为了培养青少年的社会工作能力，树立为人民服务的思想，还有计划地组织他们参加一些社会工作，进行实际锻炼。
    在进行思想政治教育和劳动教育的同时，根据青年将来就业的需要，还开设了一部分文化课和专业基础课。文化课主要是讲授语文和数学；专业基础课主要是讲授农村会计和农业基础知识。
    根据青年的特点，结合学习、劳动，开展文体活动。
    自力更生，勤俭办所
    劳动后备讲习所成立初期，全部活动都是在露天和临时借用的俱乐部进行的。后来，参加劳动后备讲习所的青年越来越多，加上所内已有了一定的积累，于是，在各单位的帮助下，发动全体师生自己动手，用一个多月盖起了简易房十七间，设立了固定活动场所，基本满足了集中活动的需要。劳动后备讲习所只有两名专职教师，其余的教师都是用兼职、代职或者是从学员中选拔的。劳动后备讲习所的设备，凡是师生能自己动手解决的就不买，有旧的就不买新的，一定要用的也本着勤俭节约的精神，尽量做到少花钱多办事。到目前为止，由师生自己动手打了简易桌凳七十二套，购置图书一千五百余册，大小生产工具三十余件。
    八里堡街试办劳动后备讲习所还不到两年，由于这是一项新的工作，缺少经验，工作中还有不少缺点，特别是面向农村的思想教育不够，区委正在进一步加强领导，改进劳动后备讲习所的工作。（附图片）
