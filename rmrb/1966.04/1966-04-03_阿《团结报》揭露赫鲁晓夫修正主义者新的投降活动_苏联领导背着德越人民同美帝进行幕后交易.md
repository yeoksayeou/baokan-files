    Tirana, March 31st (Xinhua) – Albania’s "Unity" newspaper published a commentary on the 31st, exposing the Khrushchev revisionists for conducting behind-the-scenes deals with U.S. imperialism behind the backs of the German and Vietnamese people, plotting dangerous conspiracies that endanger world peace and security.
    The commentary, titled "Another Conspiracy and Behind-the-Scenes Deal between Imperialism and Revisionism," said that the United States has recently been conducting a propaganda campaign about the "Berlin crisis" being over, and the European situation being "calm," and therefore moving some troops from Europe and West Berlin to the East, which is part of Johnson’s so-called "peace offensive." However, these inflammatory propaganda cannot fool anyone.
    The commentary listed many facts and pointed out that the Khrushchev revisionists' so-called policy of "easing tensions in Europe" has made it possible for Washington to transfer some troops from Western Europe and West Berlin to South Vietnam. If the United States did not have a tacit understanding with the Soviet revisionists, it would not be able to send additional troops to Vietnam to expand its war of aggression.
    The commentary said that the Khrushchev revisionist leaders deliberately undermined the common decision of socialist countries to sign a separate peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and resolve the West Berlin issue on this basis. In order not to hinder relations with U.S. imperialism, the Khrushchev revisionists had long replaced the signing of a peace treaty with the deceptive slogans of "European collective security" and maintaining the "status quo."
    The commentary concluded that the "status quo" pursued by the Khrushchev elements makes Washington happy. Currently, the United States' heinous war in Vietnam is causing the White House a great headache. The American aggressors in South Vietnam are suffering one defeat after another. The Pentagon has to send more and more troops to salvage the inevitable disaster. In this situation, U.S. imperialism needs "peace" in the rear in order to free up its hands to suppress the heroic Vietnamese people. The Khrushchev elements' policy of surrender is helping America in this effort. These facts once again clearly expose the deceptive and dangerous nature of slogans about "unity" and saying that the Khrushchev revisionists are giving "aid" to the heroic Vietnamese people. In fact, the Khrushchev revisionists are helping the American aggressors to get out of the dead end in every way. But this new conspiracy of the Khrushchev revisionists will inevitably meet with shameful bankruptcy as in the past.

    阿《团结报》揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义者新的投降活动
    苏联领导背着德越人民同美帝进行幕后交易
    新华社地拉那三十一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》三十一日发表评论，揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义者背着德国人民和越南人民，同美帝国主义进行幕后交易，策划危害世界和平与安全的危险阴谋。
    这篇题为《帝国主义和修正主义的另一阴谋和幕后交易》的评论说，美国最近正在进行关于“柏林危机”已经过去、欧洲局势“平静”，因此把一些部队从欧洲和西柏林东移的宣传运动，这是约翰逊的所谓“和平攻势”的一个组成部分。但是，这些煽惑人心的宣传是骗不了任何人的。
    评论列举了许多事实后指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的所谓“缓和欧洲紧张局势”的政策，使华盛顿有可能把一部分部队从西欧和西柏林转移到南越。如果美国没有同苏联修正主义者的互相谅解，它就不可能增派这部分军队到越南去扩大侵略战争。
    评论说，赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导人有意破坏社会主义国家关于同德意志民主共和国单独签订和约，并在此基础上解决西柏林问题的共同决定。为了不妨碍同美帝国主义的关系，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者早就用“欧洲集体安全”和维持“现状”的蛊惑人心的口号代替了签订对德和约。
    评论最后说，赫鲁晓夫分子所追求的“现状”使华盛顿感到高兴。目前，美国在越南的罪恶战争正使白宫大伤脑筋，美国侵略者在南越正遭到接二连三的失败，五角大楼不得不派越来越多的军队去挽救不可避免的灾难，在这种情况下，美帝国主义正需要后方的“平静”，以便腾出手来去镇压英雄的越南人民。赫鲁晓夫分子的投降政策正在帮助美国的这种努力。这些事实再次更加清楚地暴露了关于“团结”和说什么赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在给英雄的越南人民以“援助”的口号的蛊惑性和危险性。事实上，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者正在以一切方式帮助美国侵略者从死胡同里摆脱出来。但是，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的这一新阴谋必将象过去一样遭到可耻的破产。
