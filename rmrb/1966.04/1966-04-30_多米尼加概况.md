    The Dominican Republic is located on the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean Sea, surrounded by the sea on three sides, with an area of more than 48,000 square kilometers, accounting for about two-thirds of the island's area. The capital is Santo Domingo.
    After Columbus arrived in Dominica in 1492, this place began to be marked by the footprints of colonialists. Dominica first became a Spanish colony, and in 1844 the Dominican Republic was established, but in 1861 it was occupied by Spain again, and it did not regain its independence until 1865.
    However, American imperialism has carried out armed intervention more than once since the beginning of this century, turning Dominica into its semi-colony.
    Dominica has a tropical climate, beautiful scenery, and abundant products. The economy is mainly agricultural, and the main agricultural products include sugar cane, cocoa, coffee, tobacco, bananas, etc. Among them, cane sugar occupies an important position in the national economy, with an annual output of about 900,000 metric tons. However, 80 percent of sugar production is controlled by American capital. The main minerals include gold, silver, copper, iron, nickel, bauxite and petroleum, most of which have also become targets of plunder by American capital.
    The Dominican Republic has a population of more than three million, mainly mixed-race people of black and white descent and mixed-race people of indigenous and European descent. The rest are black and white people, as well as about 1,000 overseas Chinese. A long time ago, there were 250,000 Indians on the island. Later, due to the cruel enslavement and oppression of European colonists, a large number of Indians were tortured to death by poverty and disease. Seventy percent of the country's residents are engaged in agricultural production. Due to the long-term plunder by American monopoly capital and the brutal oppression by the country's reactionaries, people have lost large tracts of land, suffer from hunger and cold, and live in dire straits. Many people can only live in houses built of palm leaves and sleep on the dirt floor. (Guang)

    多米尼加概况
    多米尼加共和国，在加勒比海伊斯帕尼奥拉岛的东半部，三面环海，面积四万八千多平方公里，约占这个岛面积的三分之二。首都在圣多明各。
    一四九二年哥伦布到多米尼加之后，这个地方就开始印上殖民者的足迹。多米尼加首先沦为西班牙殖民地，到一八四四年建立了多米尼加共和国，但一八六一年又被西班牙占领，直到一八六五年才重新获得独立。
    但是，美帝国主义从本世纪初起，不止一次地进行武装干涉，把多米尼加变成了它的半殖民地。
    多米尼加属热带气候，风景秀丽，物产丰富。经济以农业为主，农产品主要有甘蔗、可可、咖啡、烟草、香蕉等。其中蔗糖在国民经济中占重要地位，年产量达九十万公吨左右。但是，蔗糖生产的百分之八十为美国资本所控制。矿产主要有金、银、铜、铁、镍、铁矾土和石油等，也大都成了美国资本掠夺的对象。
    多米尼加全国人口有三百多万，主要是黑白混血种人和印欧混血种人，其余是黑种人和白种人，还有华侨一千人左右。很早以前，岛上曾有二十五万印第安人，后来由于欧洲殖民者的残酷奴役和压榨，大批印第安人已被贫困和疾病折磨而死。全国有百分之七十的居民从事农业生产，由于美国垄断资本的长期掠夺和本国反动派的残酷压榨，人民失去大片土地，饥寒交迫，生活在水深火热之中，许多人只能住在用棕榈树叶搭成的房子里，睡在泥地上。　　　（光）
