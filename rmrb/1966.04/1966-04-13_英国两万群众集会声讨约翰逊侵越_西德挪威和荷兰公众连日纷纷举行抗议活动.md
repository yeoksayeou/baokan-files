    Xinhua News Agency, London, April 11th: Twenty thousand people from all walks of life in Britain held a mass rally at Trafalgar Square on the afternoon of April 11th to protest the American aggression in Vietnam. This was the final activity of the three-day "Easter March" held by the British public, which began on April 9th.
    Participants in the April 11th march and rally carried placards with slogans such as: "End American Atrocities in Vietnam!" "Americans Get Out, Let Vietnam Decide Its Own Future!" "Johnson is a Murderer, Wilson is an Accomplice!" "Stop Supporting American Aggression in Vietnam!"
    Representatives from fourteen foreign peace organizations, immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America in Britain, and students from Oxford University, Cambridge University, and other British universities participated in the march and rally. Twelve Labour Party members also participated in these activities. Many mothers also participated in the march, pushing strollers with protest slogans.
    The demonstrators were monitored by hundreds of police officers on their way to Trafalgar Square, and they continuously shouted angrily: "No Intervention in Vietnam!" "Yankee Butchers Get Out!" "Get Rid of American Bases!" "Polaris Submarines Get Out!" "NATO Get Out!"
    The marchers held up hundreds of flags of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, expressing their support for the struggle of the Vietnamese people. They also shouted: "Victory Belongs to the National Liberation Front!"
    During the mass rally, speakers condemned the American aggression in Vietnam and the British Labour government's support for the American aggression. Staughton Lynd, a professor at Yale University in the United States, told the assembly that in the Vietnam War, the US government "is the main murderer" and the British government "is the main accomplice."
    After the meeting, hundreds of demonstrators went to the US Embassy to protest. They were blocked by one hundred police officers and mounted police. Letters of support for the demonstration from the famous British philosopher Russell were distributed among the demonstrators.
    It is reported that the public in West Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands also held similar protests from April 9th to 11th. More than 140,000 people in West Germany expressed their opposition to American aggression in Vietnam, protesting against West Germany's plans for atomic armament and the implementation of the "Emergency Law" during demonstrations and rallies. Demonstrators demanded that the Bonn government not provide "a penny or a person" for the American war of aggression in Vietnam, and demanded that "the United States immediately stop interfering in South Vietnam."

    英国两万群众集会声讨约翰逊侵越
    西德挪威和荷兰公众连日纷纷举行抗议活动
    新华社伦敦十一日电　英国各界公众两万人十一日下午在特拉法加广场举行群众大会，抗议美国侵略越南。这是英国公众从九日开始举行的三天“复活节进军”的最后一项活动。
    参加十一日游行和集会的人拿着标语牌，上面写着：“结束美国在越南的暴行！”“美国滚出去，让越南决定自己的前途！”“约翰逊是杀人犯，威尔逊是帮凶！”“停止支持美国侵略越南！”
    参加这次游行和集会的有十四个外国和平组织的代表，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲在英国的移民，牛津大学、剑桥大学以及英国其他各大学的学生。有十二名工党议员也参加这些活动。还有不少母亲推着写有抗议标语的婴儿车带孩子参加游行。
    示威者在前往特拉法加广场的路上受到几百名警察的监视，他们不断愤怒地高呼：“不许干涉越南！”“美国佬刽子手滚出去！”“撤走美国佬基地！”“北极星潜艇滚出去！”“北大西洋公约组织滚出去！”
    游行者高举着几百面越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜，表示声援越南人民的斗争。他们还高呼：“胜利属于民族解放阵线！”
    在举行群众大会时，发言的人纷纷谴责美国侵略越南和英国工党政府支持美国的侵略。美国耶鲁大学教授斯托顿·林德对大会说，在越南战争中，美国政府“是主要的杀人犯”，英国政府“是主要的同谋犯”。
    会后，几百个示威者前往美国大使馆提抗议。他们遭到一百名警察和骑警的拦阻。在示威游行者中间散发了著名英国哲学家罗素支持示威的信件。
    据报道，西德、挪威和荷兰的公众在九日到十一日也举行了同样的抗议活动。西德公众十四万多人在举行示威和集会时，表示反对美国侵略越南，抗议西德原子武装的计划和推行“紧急状态法”。示威者要求波恩政府不要为美国的侵越战争“出一分钱、一个人”，要求“美国立即停止干涉南越”。
