    Hold High the Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Launch a Mass Design Revolution Movement
    Establish Our Own Mining Machinery System
    A batch of new mining machinery products suitable for our needs, recently designed and trial-produced in our country, have been scheduled for production, and hundreds of new mining machinery varieties have also been included in the design and trial-production plan.
    Editor's Note: The mining industry is an industry that supplies raw materials to industrial departments. At present, the mining industry in our country is still a weak link in the entire industry. Vigorously strengthening this weak link and providing sufficient raw materials to the entire industrial sector is an urgent task to promote the rapid development of the national economy.
    Our country has vast land and rich mineral resources. The natural conditions for developing the mining industry are very favorable. To make full use of this superior condition, we must build a modern mining industry and equip our mining production army with modern and efficient mechanical equipment.
    Where does modern mining machinery come from? Is it copied from foreign countries? For a period of time, this is what was done, but a large part of the manufactured mining machinery was not suitable. Equipping with such mining machinery cannot quickly change the backwardness of my country's mining industry. After Comrade Mao Zedong called for launching a design revolution movement, the situation quickly underwent tremendous changes. A large number of leading cadres and design personnel were liberated from the foreign frameworks of copying and transplanting, went deep into the front lines, went deep into the masses, proceeded from the actual situation of my country's mineral resources, and embarked on the road of modernization of my country's mining machinery. Before long, a batch of complete sets of modern mining machinery and equipment suitable for my country's needs, with high efficiency and good quality, were manufactured.
    Practice has proven that to change the backward situation of my country's mining industry, we must first change the backward thinking in designing and manufacturing mining equipment, that is, we must change the backward thinking of copying foreign countries. As long as we proceed from our own reality and take our own path, the current backward situation of the mining industry can be changed relatively quickly.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 5th. On the basis of the ideological revolutionization of leaders and employees, the mining machinery manufacturing department recently designed and trial-produced a batch of new mining machinery products suitable for our country's needs. These products are highly efficient and of good quality, and some are complete sets.
    Recently, the relevant departments such as the Ministry of Coal Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the First Ministry of Machine Building held special meetings and decided to arrange these new products for mass production this year. At the same time, hundreds of new mining machinery varieties suitable for the conditions of different mineral resources in our country have also been included in the design and trial-production plan. After these new, highly efficient complete sets of equipment are used to equip mines, the production efficiency of the mines will undergo significant changes.
    The employees of my country's mining machinery manufacturing department are determined to open up a new situation in mining machinery manufacturing within a short period of time and establish our own mining machinery system.
    Mining machinery is a weapon used by miners to directly fight against nature. The quality of mining equipment plays an important role in improving mining labor productivity and the development of mining construction and production. The development speed of various industrial departments largely depends directly on how much raw materials, materials, and fuel mines can provide for them. Therefore, the speed of development of mining machinery is a major issue that is related to the development speed of the entire national economy and whether our country can be built into a great socialist power as soon as possible.
    In the past, some leading cadres and design and research personnel in the mining machinery manufacturing department rarely went deep into the mines to conduct investigations and research, and lacked understanding of the mineral resource conditions in our country. They viewed mining machinery as relatively simple and easy, believing that it was not a high, large, sophisticated, or advanced product, and that there was nothing remarkable about it, and that no profound technology was required. Some technicians had more foreign frameworks, and they always wanted to copy foreign products in design and manufacturing. Because of this, a considerable part of the manufactured mining machinery was not suitable for the actual conditions of mineral resources in our country, and the variety, quality, and quantity were far from meeting the diverse needs of my country's mines.
    In November 1964, Chairman Mao issued a call to launch a mass design revolution movement, which pointed out the correct direction for the development of mining machinery. Many leading cadres and design and research personnel launched a resolute struggle against their long-term subjective idealism, metaphysics, and dogmatism of being divorced from productive practice, and they "went downstairs and out of the hospital" to go to the mines and participate in labor with the miners to carry out product design revolution movements.
    After personally participating in mining production practice, they discovered problems they had never discovered before. They realized that the design and manufacture of mining machinery must proceed from the various mineral resource conditions in our country, take our own path, and develop new high-efficiency mining machinery varieties in complete sets in order to quickly change the backwardness of my country's mining machinery, and develop my country's mining and beneficiation industry more, faster, better, and more economically, to meet the needs of the high-speed development of the national economy.
    In this product design revolution, they began to come into contact with production practice, understood production practice, grasped the primary information for correctly designing mining machinery, and absorbed the wisdom and creation of the masses. Finally, in a relatively short period of time, they designed and manufactured a batch of advanced mining machinery.
    In the past, our country only had two or three types of relatively inefficient combined coal mining machines. These coal mining machines were all single machines, which could not meet the needs of coal mine production. Because some processes did not have corresponding supporting machines, they could only be operated manually, which affected the improvement of coal mining efficiency. In view of this situation, not long ago, the Ministry of Coal Industry concentrated ten units to design and manufacture the first set of shallow-cut combined coal mining machine sets in our country, which realized comprehensive mechanization of the five processes of coal mining, coal loading, coal transportation, support, and moving conveyors, and combined several single machines into a whole. According to the use of some coal mines, its efficiency is one to two times higher than the coal mining machines used before, the number of personnel is reduced by more than half, and the labor intensity of workers is also greatly reduced.
    However, this type of coal mining machine set can only exert its power in gently inclined medium-thick coal seams. If other coal seams are replaced, other machine sets must be used. For this reason, relevant units continue to emancipate their minds, proceed from reality, and are currently actively designing and trial-producing new coal mining machine sets according to the coal seam conditions in our country.
    The practice of many units has proven that as long as the minds of the broad masses of employees are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, their intelligence and talents can be fully utilized, and new mining machinery can be designed and trial-produced well and quickly. Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory of the First Ministry of Machine Building successfully trial-produced multi-wire rope winders and heavy-medium coal preparation equipment; Xuanhua Pneumatic Tool Factory successfully trial-produced down-the-hole drilling rigs; Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Factory successfully trial-produced high-efficiency rock drills; Qinghai General Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced large-section rock loaders; Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory successfully trial-produced high-magnetic field strength magnetic separators, and so on. These mining machinery are used in production, which makes production efficiency double, and promotes the development of mining construction and production.
    Relevant leading departments believe that there is still a considerable gap between the current manufacturing level of mining machinery in our country and the actual needs of the country. We must continue to work hard to catch up. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, establish lofty ambitions, completely get rid of foreign crutches, dare to break through, be good at learning, go deep into reality, and follow the mass line, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome, and even the heaviest tasks can be completed.

### 高举毛泽东思想红旗开展群众性设计革命运动  建立我国自己的矿山机械系统

    高举毛泽东思想红旗开展群众性设计革命运动
    建立我国自己的矿山机械系统
    最近我国设计试制出的一批适合需要的矿山机械新产品已安排生产，数百种矿山机械新品种，也已列入设计和试制计划
    编者按：采掘工业是给工业部门供应原料的工业。目前我国的采掘工业在整个工业中还是个薄弱环节。大力加强这个薄弱环节，给整个工业部门提供充足的原料，是促进国民经济迅速发展的一项迫切任务。
    我国土地广大，矿藏丰富，发展采掘工业的自然条件是很优越的。要充分利用这个优越条件，就要建设现代化的采掘工业，就要用现代化的高效率的机械设备，把我们的矿山生产大军装备起来。
    现代化的矿山机械从哪里来呢？从外国照抄照搬来吗？曾经有一段时间，就是这样做的，可是，制造出来的很大一部分矿山机械并不适用。这样的矿山机械装备不可能迅速改变我国采掘工业的落后面貌。毛泽东同志号召开展设计革命运动以后，情况很快发生了巨大的变化。大批领导干部和设计人员从照抄照搬的洋框框中解放出来，深入现场，深入群众，从我国矿山资源的实际出发，走我国矿山机械现代化的路。没有多久，一批适合我国需要的，效率高、质量好的成套现代化矿山机械设备制造出来了。
    实践证明，要改变我国采掘工业的落后状况，首先要改变设计和制造采掘设备的落后思想，也就是要改变照抄外国的落后思想。只要从自己的实际出发走自己的路，目前采掘工业落后的状况是可以较快地改变的。
    新华社五日讯　在领导和职工思想革命化的基础上，最近矿山机械制造部门设计试制出了一批适合我国需要的矿山机械新产品。这些产品效率高，质量好，有些还是成套的。
    最近，煤炭工业部、冶金工业部和第一机械工业部等有关部门召开了专门会议，决定把这些新产品安排在今年成批生产。与此同时，数百种适合我国不同矿山资源条件的矿山机械新品种，也已列入了设计和试制计划。这些新型高效率的成套设备用来装备矿山后，矿山的生产效率将会有显著的变化。
    我国矿山机械制造部门的职工下定决心，要在不长的时间之内，在矿山机械制造方面打开一个新局面，建立起我国自己的矿山机械系统。
    矿山机械是矿山工人用来向自然界直接进行斗争的武器。矿山装备的优劣，对矿山劳动生产率的提高以及矿山建设和生产的发展有着重要的作用。工业各部门的发展速度在很大程度上直接取决于矿山能为它们提供多少原料、材料和燃料。因此，矿山机械发展快慢，是关系到整个国民经济的发展速度、关系到能否尽快把我国建设成为一个伟大的社会主义强国的大问题。
    过去，矿山机械制造部门有些领导干部和设计研究人员，很少深入矿山作调查研究，对我国矿山资源条件缺乏了解。他们把矿山机械看得比较简单容易，认为它不是高大精尖产品，没有什么了不起，不需要什么高深的技术。有一部分技术人员洋框框比较多，他们在设计制造中总想照抄照搬国外产品。因为这样，制造出来的矿山机械有相当一部分不适合我国矿山资源的实际状况，品种、质量、数量远远不能满足我国矿山多种多样的需要。
    一九六四年十一月，毛主席发出了开展群众性设计革命运动的号召，为矿山机械的发展指出了正确的方向。许多领导干部和设计研究人员同自己的长期脱离生产实践的主观主义、形而上学和教条主义展开了坚决的斗争，纷纷“下楼出院”，到矿山去，同矿山工人们一起参加劳动，开展产品设计革命运动。
    亲身参加了矿山的生产实践之后，他们发现了过去从来没有发现的问题。他们认识到，矿山机械的设计和制造，必须从我国各种不同的矿山资源条件出发，走自己的路，成套地发展高效率的矿山机械新品种，才能尽快改变我国矿山机械的落后面貌，多快好省地发展我国的矿山采掘和洗选工业，适应国民经济高速度发展的需要。
    在这场产品设计革命中，他们开始接触了生产实际，了解了生产实际，掌握了正确设计矿山机械的第一性资料，并且吸取了群众的智慧和创造，终于在比较短的时间里，把一批先进的矿山机械设计和制造出来了。
    过去我国只有两三种效率比较低的联合采煤机，这些采煤机都是单机，远远不能满足煤矿生产的需要；有的工序因为没有相应的配套机器，只能用人工操作，影响了采煤效率的提高。根据这种情况，不久前，煤炭工业部集中了十个单位，设计和制造出了我国第一套浅截式联合采煤机组，使采煤、装煤、运煤、支护、移运输机五道工序实现了综合机械化，把几种单机成龙配套组成了一个整体。据一些煤矿使用证明，它的效率比以前使用的采煤机高出一倍到两倍，人员减少一半以上，而且工人的劳动强度也大大减轻。
    但是这种采煤机组只能在缓倾斜中厚煤层才能发挥威力，换了其他煤层，就得使用别的机组。为此，有关单位继续解放思想，从实际出发，根据我国煤层条件，目前正在积极设计、试制新的采煤机组。
    好多单位的实践证明，只要用毛泽东思想武装广大职工的头脑，他们的聪明才智就能充分发挥出来，新的矿山机械也就能又好又快地设计和试制出来。第一机械工业部所属洛阳矿山机器厂试制成功多钢绳卷扬机和重介质选煤设备；宣化风动工具厂试制成功潜孔钻机；沈阳风动工具厂试制成功高效率凿岩机；青海通用机械厂试制成功大断面装岩机；沈阳矿山机器厂试制成功高磁场强度磁选机等等。这些矿山机械用于生产，使生产效率成倍的提高，促进了矿山建设和生产的发展。
    有关领导部门认为，目前我国矿山机械的制造水平同国家实际需要之间，还有一个相当大的差距。必须继续努力，迎头赶上。只要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，树雄心，立大志，彻底甩掉洋拐棍，敢于闯，善于学，深入实际，走群众路线，再大的困难也能克服，再重的任务也能完成。
