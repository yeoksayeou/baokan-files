    Xinhua News Agency, 5th Dispatch from New Delhi: After concluding her visit to the United States to beg for "aid," Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi visited the Soviet Union for two days on April 2nd and 3rd and returned to New Delhi on the 3rd.
    The new Soviet leaders gave an extremely warm and friendly reception to the Indian Prime Minister, who had made anti-China clamors during her visit to the United States. The two sides also touted the "Indo-Soviet friendship" forged in their common anti-China efforts. According to TASS and the Indian Press Trust, Soviet Chairman of the Council of Ministers Kosygin held several talks with Indian Prime Minister Gandhi "in a warm, friendly atmosphere." Kosygin praised Gandhi as "a symbol of the close ties of friendship between India and the Soviet Union" and said she "is respected by the Soviet people." Gandhi spoke extensively about the "constructive spirit unique to Indo-Soviet relations" and stated that "India is striving to strengthen its friendship with the Soviet Union in the future as well."
    The two sides also vigorously promoted the so-called "Tashkent spirit." Gandhi, on the one hand, claimed that India would act "accurately in accordance with the spirit of the Tashkent Declaration," but on the other hand, she took the opportunity to attack Pakistan for carrying out "various provocations" against India.
    According to various sources, Gandhi acted as a liaison for US-Soviet collusion on the Vietnam issue during her trip to Moscow. The Indian newspaper *The Patriot* reported on the 4th that Gandhi and Kosygin held talks "on a wide range of issues of mutual concern," "especially the Vietnam issue." Gandhi briefed on her visits and discussions in the United States, Britain, and other countries. In her speeches during her visit to the United States, Gandhi openly stated that she would serve the US "peace talks" scam on the Vietnam issue. Gandhi said at a press conference at Moscow airport: "India is currently very concerned about the situation in Vietnam… We are striving to promote a solution to this problem."
    Gandhi also invited Kosygin to visit India, and Kosygin accepted the invitation.

    印度反华迎合美苏需要
    甘地夫人访美后到莫斯科受到苏领导人热烈捧场
    印总理为美苏在越南问题上进行勾结充当联络员
    新华社五日讯　新德里消息：印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人在结束到美国乞讨“援助”的访问后，在四月二日和三日又到苏联进行了两天的访问，并在三日回到了新德里。
    苏联新领导对这位在访问美国期间大肆发出反华叫嚣的印度总理给予极为热情友好的接待，双方并且吹捧在共同反华中结成的“印苏友谊”。据塔斯社和印度报业托辣斯报道，苏联部长会议主席柯西金同印度总理甘地夫人“在热情、友好的气氛中”举行了数次会谈。柯西金赞扬甘地夫人是“印度和苏联之间友谊的密切联系的象征”，“受到了苏联人民的尊敬”。甘地夫人大谈所谓“印苏关系所特有的建设性精神”，并且表示“印度竭力在今后也加强同苏联的友谊”。
    双方还大肆鼓吹所谓“塔什干精神”。甘地夫人一面扬言印度要“准确地根据塔什干宣言的精神”行事，但是她又趁机攻击巴基斯坦对印度进行了“各种挑衅”。
    据各方面的消息透露，甘地夫人在这次莫斯科之行中，为美苏在越南问题上进行勾结充当联络员。印度的《爱国者报》四日报道说，甘地夫人同柯西金“就双方关心的广泛问题”、“特别是越南问题”进行了会谈，甘地夫人扼要谈到她在美、英等国进行访问和讨论的情况。甘地夫人在访问美国期间发表的讲话中，曾公开表示要为美国在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局效劳。甘地夫人在莫斯科机场上举行的记者招待会上说：“印度目前十分关心越南的事态，……我们力求促进这一问题的解决。”
    甘地夫人还邀请柯西金访问印度，柯西金已经接受了邀请。
