    Wu Han—A Strategist for the Chiang Dynasty and an Accomplice of American Imperialism	Li Siqun
    Abstract: Wu Han's history in the 1940s is permeated with a black line of anti-communism and anti-people. In the later stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Wu Han inherited the mantle of the cultural comprador Hu Shi, submitted memorials and strategies to Chiang Kai-shek, urging Chiang Kai-shek to extinguish the revolutionary forces as early as possible. During the Liberation War, Wu Han, in accordance with the needs of American imperialism, advocated the "third road" to establish an American-style free world in China.
    Wu Han's ugly political history has always been permeated with a black line of anti-communism and anti-people. In the 1940s, he already had a set of reactionary theories and creeds and had done many evil deeds. His mask must be stripped off so that his true face is exposed to the full light of day.
    Singing in harmony with Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely anti-communist and anti-people
    From 1943 to 1945, the people's democratic forces entered a phase of renewed ascent during the War of Resistance Against Japan. The situation at that time, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, was that "Two roads are now before the Chinese people, the road to brightness and the road to darkness. There are two kinds of destiny for China, the destiny of a bright China and the destiny of a dark China." ① Chiang Kai-shek's *China's Destiny*, published in 1943, attempted to push the Chinese people onto the dark road; Comrade Mao Zedong's *On Coalition Government*, published in 1945, pointed out a bright road for the Chinese people.
    It was during this stage that Wu Han repeatedly submitted "strategies" to Chiang Kai-shek. The intent of his strategies was exactly the same as Chiang Kai-shek's infamous *China's Destiny*.
    *China's Destiny* said:
    "Three hundred years ago, the Ming dynasty was overthrown under the internal and external aggression of the roving bandits such as Li Chuang and Zhang Xianzhong and the Manchu banner troops."
    Wu Han immediately made a big deal out of this topic of "soliciting advice and inquiry," writing *Historical Lessons from Three Hundred Years Ago* and *On the "Roving Bandits" of the Late Ming Dynasty*. His strategy was: We should accept "historical lessons" and "use all our strength to eliminate the 'roving bandits'" and extinguish the revolutionary forces as early as possible.
    *China's Destiny* said:
    "The governance of a country and the rise and fall of a nation often shift with the social atmosphere." "In our China, at the turning point of national prosperity and decline, there must be a few politicians and scholars who rise up to take on the responsibility of reversing the universe and transforming the atmosphere." Wu Han immediately wrote *On Social Atmosphere*. As a strategy, he wrote:
    The formation of a "special era spirit and social atmosphere" "seems to have little to do with the common people; the role of those who govern the world is only to add momentum. The mainstream actually originates from the middle stratum of the scholar-official group, coupled with the advocacy of the upper level and the agreement of the lower level, which will create a prevailing atmosphere that permeates an era. Regardless of history's evaluation of what is 'admired,' only the middle stratum of the scholar-official group can take the responsibility for initiating the mainstream and transforming the social atmosphere, which is so-called reforming customs." ②
    Everyone, look at the harmony between Chiang Kai-shek and Wu Han, the ruler and his subject, how well they resonate with each other, how seamlessly they fit!
    *China's Destiny* said:
    "We must... establish the people's faith, restore the government's credibility, and officials in politics and generals in the military must ask themselves whether they can uphold the teachings of the National Father, practice the instructions of the revolution, and act according to their conscience?"
    Wu Han truly did not fail his lord's command and immediately wrote *On Scholars* based on this topic. His strategy was:
    "Scholars originally received two kinds of training: literary affairs and military affairs. In peacetime, they govern the people; in wartime, they command the army; both are their duties."
    "Scholars are situated between the upper and lower classes, receiving special education. In peacetime, they are officials who govern the people; in wartime, they are the main force in war." ③
    Everyone, look, aren't Wu Han's strategies of "literary scholars," "military scholars," "governing the people in peacetime," and "commanding the army in wartime" humbly offering advice to Chiang Kai-shek on how to establish the faith of "officials in politics" and "generals in the military" in response to his inquiry? The Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique relied on "military scholars" to carry out the counter-revolutionary "mopping-up" wars, and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique relied on "literary scholars" to implement counter-revolutionary cultural autocracy and "transform the atmosphere." Wu Han's "scholar" theory not only used history to talk about reality, but also directly praised the great achievements of the Kuomintang reactionaries in opposing communism and the people. His strategy clearly stated:
    "In the seven years of arduous fighting, literary scholars should not take sole credit; the great merit belongs to the military scholars who shed blood and gave their lives on the front lines." ④
    It can be seen that "literary scholars" and "military scholars" are not about history. To whom was the Kuomintang's "seven years of arduous fighting" a "arduous fight?" Against the Japanese invaders? No. As everyone knows, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang had always been passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism. The "arduous fighting" here is obviously against the Communist Party, is the three anti-communist upsurges! Where were the "front lines" where people "shed blood and gave their lives?" On the edge of the occupied areas? No. Wu Han specifically pointed out the words "Northwest" when discussing the crisis of the Ming Dynasty "roving bandits," and the "front lines" here also allude to Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia!
    Wu Han's several strategies are quite interconnected. Chiang Kai-shek opposed communism and the people, speaking of "literary affairs and military preparedness corresponding to each other," "always hoping that our country's scholars will make academic studies relevant to daily life and that culture will return to the foundation of national construction," attempting to push China onto the dark road through the then "Revival Pass" fascist training method. Wu Han immediately accepted this intention and stood out, talking at length about "raising the social status of scholars, literary affairs and military affairs must be given equal importance, and political standards and social status must be improved; this is an issue that the whole country should devote itself to." He offered Chiang Kai-shek the strategy of "using all our strength to eliminate the 'roving bandits'" and the strategy of relying on the "middle stratum of the scholar-official group" to "transform the social atmosphere," which ultimately boiled down to the "special education and training" and "special spiritual training" of "literary scholars" and "military scholars."
    It should be particularly pointed out here that Wu Han's strategies are not entirely his "original ideas." The so-called "special training" for "scholars" inherited the mantle of Hu Shi.
    "Special training," this term that exudes a nauseating reactionary odor, is precisely Hu Shi's old vocabulary. As early as the 1930s, Hu Shi had already taught his disciple Wu Han in his article *The Source of Leadership Talent*:
    "Those who become leaders must have innate talent as a foundation, but their knowledge, insight, and demeanor must rely on their education and training. An era has its era's 'scholar-officials,' and a country has its model leaders. Their superiority and inferiority cannot escape the influence of their education and training."
    "The source of this leadership training in ancient times almost entirely relied on the special training of special classes (such as the scholar-official families of ancient China, the aristocratic families of Japan, and the aristocratic classes and churches of Europe)." ⑤
    Wu Han unabashedly copied this reactionary theory to offer advice to Chiang Kai-shek, saying, "Scholars have special tasks in politics and society and enjoy the special privilege of education among the four classes of people," "not only receiving special education and training but also special spiritual training," "under these two kinds of training, they cultivate their moral concepts—loyalty." ⑥
    Hu Shi also said:
    "The qualifications for leaders are no longer as easy as in ancient times. ... In today's China, leaders must possess sufficient modern knowledge, sufficient modern training, and a personality that can inspire faith in the majority of people." ⑦
    Based on Hu Shi's true thoughts, to explain this passage, it means that the "leaders" of the new-style scholar-officials must receive the "modern training" of complete imperialist enslavement thought.
    Wu Han did not forget his teacher's teachings. When Chiang Kai-shek sang the tune of "the Kuomintang taking the inherent virtues of our nation and using emotion, morality, responsibility, and duty as the spirit of party organization," Wu Han's strategy emphasized the "moral concepts—loyalty" cultivated by scholar-officials under "special training"; and when Chiang Kai-shek, under the direction of his American masters, wanted to decorate the hypocritical "democracy" facade, Wu Han moved "sufficient modern knowledge" and "sufficient modern training," vigorously promoting American bourgeois democracy in articles such as *On Democratic Politics* and *Newspapers and Public Opinion*, and clearly proposed, "As for China today, the democracy we want to implement... is mainly based on Roosevelt's Four Freedoms..."
    Wu Han's "middle stratum of the scholar-official group," which serves as the pivot for "transforming the social atmosphere," is the "leadership talent" that Hu Shi spoke of; and the "special training" of the "leadership talent" that Hu Shi spoke of is the "intellectual and spiritual control" of Chinese intellectuals that American imperialism has consistently advocated. As early as the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, James, the president of the University of Illinois, advocated in a letter to then-U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt that "we should completely control China's development by controlling Chinese leaders in knowledge and spirit"; ⑧ Bu Fangji, the president of St. John's University, also openly declared: The United States "must train not only church leaders but also national leaders." ⑨ It can be seen that Wu Han's advice of talking at length about "special education and training" and "special spiritual training" has its origins, being inherited in a continuous line from American imperialism to Hu Shi.
    In the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China, all reactionary writers and strategists possessed feudal and comprador qualities. Wu Han, who had received "modern training" at Tsinghua University and had been influenced by the great cultural comprador Hu Shi, could not but express the reactionary teachings of the combination of imperialist enslavement thought and feudal restorationism in his anti-communist and anti-people political views when he submitted strategies to Chiang Kai-shek, the head of the landlord class and the comprador bourgeoisie.
    Relying on the breath of American imperialism, vainly attempting to take the "third road"
    During the Third Domestic Revolutionary War, two destinies of China launched a decisive battle.
    In 1946, Chiang Kai-shek, with the support of American imperialism, provoked the civil war; in 1947, the People's Liberation Army turned to a nationwide offensive. The situation at that time, as Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, was: "The Chinese People's Liberation Army has already reversed the counter-revolutionary wheel of American imperialism and its running dog, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, on the land of China, causing it to move towards the path of destruction, and has advanced its own revolutionary wheel, causing it to move towards the path of victory. This is a historical turning point. This is the turning point of Chiang Kai-shek's twenty years of counter-revolutionary rule from development to annihilation. This is the turning point of imperialism's rule in China for more than a hundred years from development to annihilation." ⑩ The development of history fully confirmed Comrade Mao Zedong's great scientific prediction.
    It was at this historical turning point that Wu Han ran around and became active. He relied on the breath of his American masters and strenuously clamored that the responsibility for the civil war should be shared by both sides in order to cooperate with the "mediation" conspiracy of American imperialism. He sang the high praises of the "middle class" determining everything, took the lead in advocating taking the "third road," and promoted the establishment of an American-style "free world" in China to meet the needs of American imperialism in vigorously supporting the "third force." He rehashed the old tune of the "moral concept—loyalty" of the scholar-officials, demanding that people accept the "test" and be buried with the U.S.-Chiang reactionary dynasty, vainly attempting to block the advance of the revolutionary wheel. In the article *On the New Foundation*, Wu Han made a false show of strength and put forward the so-called political program of the "middle class." What exactly is the "middle class?" He said:
    "Assuming that China's population is 450 million, the middle class accounts for more than 90 percent. If 90 percent of the people can participate in this new foundation and strengthen this new foundation, any problem can be solved and any difficulty can be overcome."
    Here, Wu Han touted the "middle class" as a remarkable and magical force. However, Fei Xiaotong, who discussed the issue of "China's social structure" with Wu Han, revealed his bottom line. The so-called "middle class" actually neither has so many people nor has so much power; the so-called "middle class" is just a small group of "democratic individualists" who have "no power" whom American imperialism has "always wanted to cultivate" in China, that is, "liberal figures in the Kuomintang" or "liberal figures" not in the Kuomintang.
    Fei Xiaotong revealed the secrets this way:
    "In essence, the American policy toward China is to maintain the National Government... If the Communist Party really has the possibility of winning, the United States must try to prevent the war from proceeding in order to avoid such a day; the United States has always wanted to cultivate a middle class in China—a third force. It is a pity that China's third force has no power, and the United States also knows that China's third force is powerless, only preparing to give a large amount of loans after the establishment of a third government, so as to use this to cultivate its power." ?
    Fei Xiaotong explained the ins and outs of the so-called "middle class" clearly, and his news was based on reliable sources.
    Let us listen to the confession of American imperialism.
    On January 7, 1947, U.S. President's special envoy Marshall, in his statement leaving China, called on "liberal figures in the government and the opposition" to lead Chinese politics, believing that "this kind of liberal figure is a collection of excellent people" and should be made to "hold a leading position."
    On September 29, 1947, Stuart reported to Secretary of State Marshall:
    "Progressive elements within the government (referring to the Kuomintang government—author's note) and many sympathizers outside the government will be greatly encouraged if we express our intention to help them, and, in my opinion, they will become the core, and we can gradually realize our goals for China and the goals of stability for this part of the world through them. But without this kind of assistance from us, they seem to have little hope, and any authoritative expression of our policy will be very powerful."
    Acheson's White Paper described this aspect of Stuart's activities as follows:
    "In his talks with Chinese government leaders, he took every opportunity to emphasize that the Chinese government must take action to put liberal figures in a leading position, weaken the forces of reactionary groups, and promote basic reforms. It was felt that only through this action could the Chinese government successfully meet the challenge of the CCP, prevent the waste of its own resources, and effectively use American aid."
    In 1948, Stuart encouraged the "liberal figures" of the "middle class" to come out and organize new parties or groups. He made this speech:
    "I have said that China is currently facing such a most serious situation that anyone who loves his country, especially educated patriots, seems to have a great opportunity and responsibility to study together what are the problems of the country and to awaken and guide the people of the whole country so that they can realize a democratic government... I think that these people can form a new party and constructively criticize the government, and they can also form several groups to promote several reform proposals and progressive movements... The American people have high expectations for this so that their assistance can achieve the greatest effect."
    On July 30, 1949, Acheson, in a letter to President Truman, was still "encouraging" the "middle class," saying that China's "democratic individualism will eventually reappear."
    This is how American imperialism supported Wu Han's so-called "middle class" and placed great hopes on it.
    This "middle class" is not at all "90 percent of the people," but a small number of people in the upper petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie in the Chiang Kai-shek-controlled area, that is, the right-wing elements of these classes. As Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out, they have reactionary political tendencies, spread illusions for American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique, and oppose the people's democratic revolution. Wu Han, adapting to the needs of American imperialism, wildly wanted to organize this part of the people and gather them into a reactionary social force. He shouted loudly:
    "To establish a people's driving force centered on convening a national affairs conference." "The power of the people is latent. An organization that represents the sum of the power of the people... is necessary today and should be made a reality immediately." ?
    Here, Wu Han has gone even further than his past "scholar" theories, not only using it to offer advice to the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, but also sitting still and unable to wait, openly calling for the "immediate" establishment of an "organization" and building "power."
    Lenin said: "Any political crisis, no matter what its outcome, will bring benefits because it can turn hidden things into obvious things, expose politically active forces, expose all kinds of deceptions and self-deceptions as well as empty talk and fabrications, clearly point out the 'true state of affairs,' and can be said to force it into people's minds." ? Things are exactly like this. The more the revolution develops, the more the crisis of the U.S.-Chiang ruling dynasty deepens, and the clearer Wu Han's reactionary political face is exposed. On the eve of the U.S.-Chiang ruling dynasty being on the verge of extinction, the question facing the Chinese people, all democratic parties, and all people's organizations was: to carry the revolution through to the end or to abandon the revolution halfway. There is no "opposition" to establish here, and there is no "middle route" to take. Faced with this sharp question, what choice did Wu Han make?
    Wu Han's choice is written in the article *On Scholar-Officials*. He said: "Scholar-officials stand between the universal anger of the people and the despotic and terroristic rule, and also stand between the demand for reform and progress and the conservative reaction. To use a new term, it is taking the middle route." ? However, Wu Han could not but realize that this "middle route" was already very unreliable and that the real "test" had arrived. He borrowed from history and listed two types of scholar-officials. One type is those who "can always sing regardless of who comes to power," the typical example being Qian Qianyi, who is listed first in the *Biographies of Two-Faced Officials*, as well as Hou Xun, Ruan Dacheng, and Wu Weiye; the other type is those who "die for their beliefs, for the interests of their class, and for the privileges they defend"; for example, Fan Pang, Chen Fan, Yan Zhenqing... all the way to Yang Jisheng, Yang Lian, Zuo Guangdou, Shi Kefa, and Tan Sitong. Wu Han believes that the latter "are all scholar-officials. Although they failed, they have bones, flesh and blood, and souls; they are loyal to the feudal morality of feudal society." Here, the reactionary tune of the "moral concept—loyalty" of the scholar-officials appears again, but it is no longer as joyful and encouraging as when he was submitting strategies to Chiang Kai-shek in the past but is full of dark colors.
    Wu Han then warned:
    "When two dynasties change, or when society undergoes major reforms, it is often a test for people. Now, I am afraid, it is time for a test again. This test includes you and me." ?
    This article was a lecture given by Wu Han at Tsinghua University in the spring of 1948. In 1948, the defeat of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries was a foregone conclusion, and the liberation cause of the Chinese people was approaching a nationwide victory. This was not just a change of dynasty, nor just "major reforms in society," but a great transformation that had never occurred in Chinese history. At such a historical turning point, Wu Han put forward such "historical lessons" of two kinds of scholar-officials. Isn't his reactionary stance clear enough? Wu Han here advised the "middle class": Adhere to the "beliefs" of the U.S.-Chiang reactionaries, maintain the "class interests" of the landlord class and the comprador bourgeoisie, protect the "privileges" of this class, and make good spiritual preparations to be buried with the dying U.S.-Chiang ruling dynasty and not be listed in the *Biographies of Two-Faced Officials*!
    Wu Han in the 1940s had already stood on the anti-communist and anti-people's stand. Looking at the past and thinking about today, it is not accidental that Wu Han in the 1960s came out to cheer and overturn the verdicts for right-leaning opportunists, but it obviously has its historical and class roots.

### 吴晗——蒋家王朝的策士、美帝的帮办

    吴晗——蒋家王朝的策士、美帝的帮办	黎斯群
    提　要：吴晗的四十年代的历史，贯串着一条反共反人民的黑线。在抗日战争后期，吴晗继承了文化买办胡适的衣钵，向蒋介石上疏对策，要蒋介石及早扑灭革命力量。在解放战争时期，吴晗适应美帝国主义的需要，鼓吹“第三条道路”，在中国建立美国式的自由世界。
    吴晗丑恶的政治历史，始终贯串着一条反共反人民的黑线。在四十年代，他已有了一套反动的理论、信条，并且干了不少罪恶的勾当。必须剥净他的画皮，使其真面目暴露于光天化日之下。
    同蒋介石一唱一和，坚决反共反人民
    一九四三年至一九四五年，是抗日战争时期人民民主力量的再上升阶段。当时的形势，正如毛泽东同志所指出的，“在中国人民面前摆着两条路，光明的路和黑暗的路。有两种中国之命运，光明的中国之命运和黑暗的中国之命运。”①蒋介石在一九四三年发表的《中国之命运》，妄图把中国人民推向黑暗的路；毛泽东同志在一九四五年发表的《论联合政府》，则为中国人民指出了一条光明的路。
    就在这个阶段，吴晗一再向蒋介石上疏“对策”。他的策论所禀的旨意，就是蒋介石的遗臭万年的《中国之命运》。
    《中国之命运》说： 
    “三百年前的明室，在李闯、张献忠等流寇与满族的旗兵，内外交侵之下，竟以覆灭。”
    吴晗立即根据这个“受策察问”的题目大做文章，写了《三百年前的历史教训》和《论晚明“流寇”》。他的对策是：应当接受“历史教训”，“用全力来消灭‘流寇’”，及早扑灭革命力量。
    《中国之命运》说：
    “国家的治乱，民族的兴亡，常以社会风气为转移。”“在我们中国，当民族盛衰绝续之交，必有少数的政治家和学者兴起，来担当这旋乾转坤，改造风气的责任。”吴晗立即写了《论社会风气》。作为对策，他写道：
    “特殊时代精神，社会风气”的形成，“大体上似乎与小百姓无干，治天下者的作用也只是推波助澜，主流实实在在发于中层的士大夫集团，加以上层的提倡，下层的随和，才会蔚为风气，滂薄一世。不管历史对所‘尚’的评价如何，就主流的发动而动，转变社会风气，也就是所谓移风易俗，只有中层的士大夫集团才能负起责任。”②
    大家看，蒋介石和吴晗的君臣之间的倡随，何等上下相融，契合无间！
    《中国之命运》说：
    “我们要……树立民众的信仰，恢复政府的信誉，必须从政的官吏，治军的将领，反躬自问，自己是不是能秉承国父的遗教，实践革心的指示，各行其良心之所安？”
    吴晗真是不辱君命，立即根据这个题目，写了《说士》。他的对策是：
    “士原来受文事武事两种训练，平时治民，战时治军，都是本分。”
    “士介在上下层两阶级之间，受特殊的教育，在平时是治民的官吏，在战时是战争的主力。”③
    大家看，吴晗的“文士”、“武士”、“平时治民”、“战时治军”的对策，岂不是应蒋介石察问如何树立“从政的官吏”、“治军的将领”的信仰，来卑躬献计么？蒋介石反动集团进行反革命的“扫荡”战争，那是要靠“武士”的，蒋介石反动集团实施反革命的文化专制主义、“改造风气”，那是要靠“文士”的。吴晗的“士”论不仅借历史谈现实，而且直接颂扬了国民党反动派的反共反人民的大功，他的对策中就明明白白地说过这样的话：
    “七年来的艰苦作战，文士不应独居其功，大功当属于前线流血授命的武士。”④
    可见，“文士”“武士”云云，谈的不是历史。所谓国民党的“七年来的艰苦作战”，是对谁“艰苦作战”呢？对日寇吗？不是。大家知道，在抗日战争期间，国民党一直是消极抗日，积极反共的。这里的“艰苦作战”显然是对共产党，是三次反共高潮！所谓“前线流血授命”，“前线”在哪里呢？在沦陷区的边缘吗？不是。吴晗在论明代“流寇”的危机时特别指出“西北”字样，这里的“前线”也暗示陕甘宁！
    吴晗的这几篇策论，颇有其联贯性。蒋介石反共反人民，讲“文事与武备相应”，“总望我国学者，务使学术切于人生日用，文化归于建国的基业”，企图通过当时“复兴关”法西斯训练的方法，把中国推向黑暗的路。吴晗即承此旨意，脱颖而出，大谈“要提高士的社会地位，必须文事和武事并重，必须政治水准和社会地位的提高，这是全国所应全力以赴的课题”。他向蒋介石既献“用全力来消灭‘流寇’”之策，又献依靠“中层士大夫集团”来“转变社会风气”之策，而归本于“文士”、“武士”的“特殊的教育训练”和“特殊的精神训练”。
    这里应该特别指出，吴晗的策论并不完全是他的“创见”，所谓对“士”的“特殊训练”，即继承了胡适的衣钵。
    “特殊训练”，这个散发着令人作呕的反动气味的用语，正是胡适的旧语汇。早在三十年代，胡适在《领袖人才的来源》一文中，就已这样教导过他的门徒吴晗：
    “凡成为领袖人物的，固然必须有过人的天资做底子，可是他们的知识见地，做人的风度，总得靠他们的教育训练。一个时代有一个时代的‘士大夫’，一个国家有一个国家的范型式的领袖人物。他们的高下优劣，总逃不出他们所受的教育训练的势力。”
    “这种领袖人物的训育的来源，在古代差不多全靠特殊阶级（如中国古代的士大夫门阀，如日本的贵族门阀，如欧洲的贵族阶级及教会）的特殊训练。”⑤
    吴晗毫不隐避，直接抄袭了这个反动理论来向蒋介石献策，他说，“士在政治上社会上负有特殊的任务，在四民之中独享教育的特权”，“不但受特殊的教育训练，也受特殊的精神训练”，“在这两种训练下，养成了他们的道德观念——忠”。⑥
    胡适又说：
    “领袖人物的资格在今日已不比古代的容易了。……在今日的中国，领袖人物必须具备充分的现代见识，必须有充分的现代训练，必须有足以引起多数人信仰的人格。”⑦
    根据胡适的真实思想，对这段话加以解释，那就是说，新式士大夫的“领袖人物”，必须受充分的帝国主义奴化思想的“现代训练”。
    吴晗没有忘掉师教。当蒋介石高唱“国民党一本我民族固有的德性，以情感道义与责任义务为组党的精神”的调子时，吴晗的对策中所强调的是士大夫在“特殊训练”下所养成的“道德观念——忠”；而当蒋介石在美国主子指使下要妆点虚伪透顶的“民主”门面时，吴晗便搬运“充分的现代知识”、“充分的现代训练”，在《论民主政治》、《报纸与舆论》等文中大肆宣扬美国的资产阶级民主，并且明确提出，“就今天中国而说，我们所要实行的民主，……主要的根据是罗斯福的四大自由……”。
    吴晗所讲的作为“转变社会风气”之枢纽的“中层士大夫集团”，即胡适所讲的“领袖人才”；而胡适所讲的“领袖人才”的“特殊训练”，又是美帝国主义一贯主张的对中国知识分子的“知识和精神方面的控制”。早在十九世纪末、二十世纪初，美国伊里诺大学校长詹姆士在给当时美国总统西·罗斯福的信中就已鼓吹“通过对中国领袖们在知识和精神方面的控制而将中国的发展完全掌握在我们的手里”；⑧圣约翰大学校长卜舫济也公然宣称：美国“要训练不仅是教会的领袖人才，而且还有国家的领袖人才。”⑨可见，吴晗的献策中大谈“特殊的教育训练”和“特殊的精神训练”，其立论是渊源有自的，是从美帝国主义到胡适那里一脉相承的。
    在半封建半殖民地的旧中国，一切反动文人和策士总具有封建性和买办性。受过清华大学的“现代训练”、受过大文化买办胡适熏陶的吴晗，在向大地主阶级、大买办资产阶级的头子蒋介石上疏对策时，不能不在其反共反人民的政治观中表现出帝国主义奴化思想和封建复古主义相为结合的反动说教。
    仰承美帝国主义鼻息，妄想走“第三条道路”
    在第三次国内革命战争时期，两种中国之命运展开了决战。
    一九四六年，蒋介石在美帝国主义支持下挑动了内战；一九四七年，人民解放军转入了全国规模的进攻。当时的形势，正如毛泽东同志所指出的：“中国人民解放军已经在中国这一块土地上扭转了美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石匪帮的反革命车轮，使之走向覆灭的道路，推进了自己的革命车轮，使之走向胜利的道路。这是一个历史的转折点。这是蒋介石的二十年反革命统治由发展到消灭的转折点。这是一百多年以来帝国主义在中国的统治由发展到消灭的转折点。”⑩历史的发展完全证实了毛泽东同志的伟大的科学预见。
    就在这个历史转折关头，吴晗四出奔走，活跃起来。他仰承美国主子的鼻息，使劲叫嚷内战的责任应双方分担，以配合美帝国主义“调解”的阴谋。他高唱“中间阶层”决定一切，率先倡导走“第三条道路”，鼓吹在中国建立美国式的“自由世界”，以适应美帝国主义大力扶植“第三者力量”的需要。他重弹士大夫的“道德观念——忠”的老调，要人们接受“考验”，为美蒋反动王朝殉葬，妄图阻挡革命车轮的前进。在《论新基础》一文中，吴晗虚张声势，提出所谓“中间阶层”的政治方案。究竟什么是“中间阶层”呢？他说：
    “中国的人口假定有四万万五千万，中间阶层占百分之九十以上，百分之九十的人民能够参加这新基础，坚强这新基础，任何问题是可以解决的，任何困难是可以征服的。”
    这里，吴晗把“中间阶层”吹嘘成为了不起的神奇力量。然而与吴晗一起讨论“中国社会结构”问题的费孝通却泄了他的底。所谓“中间阶层”其实既没有那么多人，也没有那么大的力量；所谓“中间阶层”，只不过是美帝国主义“始终想在中国培植”的一小撮“一无力量”的“民主个人主义者”，即“国民党的自由主义人士”或非国民党的“自由主义人士”。
    费孝通是这样泄漏天机的：
    “在本质上，美国的对华政策是要维持国民政府的，……如果共产党真有获胜可能的话，美国必须设法阻止这战争的进行，以避免这样的一天；美国始终想在中国培植中间阶层，——第三者的势力，可怜的是中国第三者一无力量，美国也知道中国第三者无力，唯预备在建立第三者政府以后，再以大量贷款给予，俾借此以养成其力量。”?
    费孝通把所谓“中间阶层”的来龙去脉讲得一清二楚，而且他的消息是确有依据的。
    让我们再听一听美帝国主义的招供。
    一九四七年一月七日，美总统特使马歇尔在离华声明中，呼吁“朝野的自由主义人士”出面领导中国政治，认为“此种自由主义人士为优秀人物之集合”，应使之“居于领导地位”。
    一九四七年九月二十九日，司徒雷登向国务卿马歇尔报告：
    “政府（指国民党政府——作者注）内部的进步分子以及在政府外部的许多同情者，若我们表示有意帮助他们，将得到巨大鼓舞，并且，根据我的意见，他们将成为核心，我们很可以通过他们逐步实现我们对于中国的目的，以及对于世界的这一部分稳定的目的。但是若无我们这种援助，他们看来没有多大希望，而我们的政策上的任何权威性的表示，都将是很有力量的。”
    艾奇逊的白皮书对司徒雷登的这一方面活动，作了如下的描述：
    “在与中国政府领袖的会谈中，他利用每一个机会来强调了中国政府必须采取行动，使自由主义人士处于领导地位，削弱反动集团的势力，并推行基本的改革措施。人们感到，中国政府只有经由这种行动，才能成功地迎接中共的挑战，才能防止浪费自己的资源，才能有效地运用美国的援助。”
    一九四八年，司徒雷登鼓励“中间阶层”的“自由主义人士”出来组织新党或团体，他发表了这样的讲话：
    “余曾称中国目前面临如此最严重之情势时，凡爱其国家者尤其曾受教育之爱国人士，似有一极大机会与责任，以群策群力研究何者为国家之问题，且唤醒并指导全国人民，俾使渠等得以实现民主政府，……余以为此辈人士可组一新党，而对政府作建设性之批评，亦可组成若干团体，以倡导若干有关改革之主张及进步之运动。……美国人民对此期待颇殷，俾其援助可得到最大效果。”
    一九四九年七月三十日，艾奇逊在致杜鲁门总统的信中还在“鼓舞”“中间阶层”，说中国的“民主个人主义终于会再显身手”。
    美帝国主义就是这样扶植吴晗所谓的“中间阶层”，对它寄予极大的希望。
    这个“中间阶层”，完全不是什么“百分之九十的人民”，而是蒋介石统治区域的上层小资产阶级和中等资产阶级中为数不多的一部分人，即这些阶级的右翼分子。正如毛泽东同志所指出的，他们存在着反动的政治倾向，他们替美国帝国主义和蒋介石反动集团散布幻想，他们反对人民民主革命。吴晗适应美帝国主义的需要，狂妄地要把这一部分人组织起来，聚集成一股反动的社会力量，他这样大喊大叫：
    “要建立一个以召集国是会议为中心的人民推动力量。”“人民的力量是潜在的，一个代表人民力量总和的组织，……在今天是必需的，应该使其立刻现实存在的。”?
    吴晗在这里，比过去的“士”论更变本加厉，不仅用它来向美蒋反动派献策，而且已经坐不住、等不得，公然号召“立刻”成立“组织”，建立“力量”。
    列宁说：“任何政治危机，不管其结局如何，也都会带来好处，因为它能使隐蔽的事物变为明显的事物，暴露政治上活跃的力量，揭穿各种欺骗和自我欺骗以及空谈和虚构，明显地指出‘事物的真象’，并且可以说是用强力把它塞进人们的头脑。”?事情正是这样。革命愈发展，美蒋统治王朝的危机愈深化，吴晗的反动政治面目就暴露得愈清楚。到了美蒋统治王朝濒于灭亡的前夕，摆在中国人民、各民主党派、各人民团体面前的问题是：将革命进行到底，还是使革命半途而废。这里没有什么“反对派”可建立，也没有什么“中间路线”可走。在这个尖锐的问题前面，吴晗作了怎样的选择呢？
    吴晗的选择写在《论士大夫》一文中。他说：“士大夫是站在人民普遍愤怒与专制恐怖统治之间，也站在要求改革要求进步与保守反动之间。用新命词来说是走中间路线。”?但是，吴晗不能不意识到这种“中间路线”已经很靠不住，真正的“考验”来临了。他假借历史，列举了两类士大夫。一类是“反正不管谁上台总有戏唱”的，典型的例子是《贰臣传》首列的钱谦益，还有侯恂、阮大铖、吴梅村；另一类是“为了他们的信念，为了他们的阶层利益，为了他们所保卫的特权而死”的；例如范滂、陈蕃、颜真卿……一直到杨继盛、杨琏、左光斗、史可法、谭嗣同。吴晗认为后者“都是士大夫，虽然失败，是有骨头的，有血有肉，有灵魂的，是忠于封建社会的封建道德的。”这里，再一次出现士大夫的“道德观念——忠”的反动调子，但已经不象过去向蒋介石上疏对策时那样欢欣鼓舞，而是充满着阴暗的色彩。
    吴晗接着警告说：
    “当两个朝代交换，或者是社会有很大的改革的时候，往往是对人的一种考验。现在恐怕又是到了一个考验的时候了，这考验包括你也包括我。”?
    这篇文章是一九四八年春吴晗在清华大学的讲演。一九四八年，美蒋反动派的败局已定，中国人民的解放事业已接近全国性的胜利，这不是什么改朝换代，也不止“是社会有很大的改革”，而是中国历史上从来未有的翻天覆地的大变革。吴晗在这样的历史转折关头，提出这样的两种士大夫的“历史教训”，其反动立场难道还不够露骨吗？吴晗在这里向“中间阶层”进言：坚持美蒋反动派的“信念”，维护大地主阶级、大买办资产阶级的“阶层利益”，保卫这个阶级的“特权”，作好精神准备，为垂死的美蒋统治王朝殉葬，而勿列入《贰臣传》！
    四十年代的吴晗，早就站在反共反人民的立场上。看过去，想今天，六十年代的吴晗出来为右倾机会主义分子叫好、翻案，并不是偶然的，而显然有其历史的阶级的根源。
