    Reversing Light and Darkness	Liu Chunhuan, Mei Yulan, Wang Fuyang
    What are the "bright side" and "dark side" of history? Comrade Wu Han said: "Some books also write about the activities of the ruling class, but only talk about their dark side, not the bright side." "…As a result, except for Qin Shi Huang, leaders of relatively prosperous times such as Han Wu, Tang Zong, Kangxi, and Qianlong are not written about or rarely depicted. Thus, the bright side of history is lost. What is written in books is only how bad this dynasty was, how the peasant uprising overthrew it, how another dynasty rose, and how bad it was again, and how the peasant uprising overthrew it again. A chorus of denunciation makes history almost a pitch-black, dismal affair.” In Wu Han's view, the so-called "bright side" is the cruel rule of the landlord class leaders like Qin Huang, Han Wu, Tang Zong, Kangxi, and others over the working people; the "dark side" is peasant uprisings and peasant wars. This is a fundamental distortion of history. Wu Han believes that any move of the feudal landlord class is "great," and their "good governance" determined the development of history. What are the "literary achievements" of the "golden age" in the feudal society, such as the "Rule of Wen and Jing," "Reign of Zhenguan," and "Kaiyuan Era," which were vigorously promoted by feudal court literati. In our era of socialist revolution today, Wu Han shouts himself hoarse to boast about the "great achievements" of the feudal "holy ancestors" in governing the country; what position is he standing on? Who is he appealing for? Isn't it obvious? What kind of "bright side" did the feudal ruling class form in history? Please see what a history of the blood and tears of the working people the construction of the Ming Tombs is!
    Each tomb required a large amount of nanmu wood, three and a half chi in circumference and three zhang in height, which was sourced from the virgin forests of Sichuan. Often a thousand people would enter the mountains to collect wood, and only five hundred would return. The construction of the tombs also required stone materials. Each time a stone material three zhang in length, one zhang in width, and five chi in thickness was transported, it required a sixteen-wheeled cart, 20,000 laborers, and twenty-eight days to transport it from Fangshan to Beijing, which was the shortest distance. As for transporting building materials from thousands of miles away, in winter, water was sprinkled to lay ice, and they were pulled step by step to Beijing. It is said that the Yongling Tomb used 40,000 laborers every day and took twelve years to build. After the completion, the Jiajing Emperor was still dissatisfied and said: "Is this all there is to my tomb?" The ministers hurriedly fawned and replied: "No, there is still an outer wall." The emperor and his ministers asked and answered, adding much burden and pain to the working people! The ruling class lived a life of extravagance while alive and wanted wealth and honor for ten thousand years after death, causing the working people to be ruined and displaced. A local commune member said: "In order to bury a pile of smelly bones of the emperor, tens of thousands of lives have to be exchanged!" Chairman Mao said: "The extreme poverty and backwardness of the peasants caused by such cruel exploitation and oppression by the landlord class are the basic reasons for the stagnation of Chinese society in economic and social life for thousands of years." The landlord class seriously hindered the development of social history, and their crimes are too numerous to count. There is no end to exposing them, what is there to praise?
    Who is the true master of creating history? The people. Only the people are the true driving force for creating world history. The Great Wall, the Grand Canal, and the Dunhuang murals were all created by the working people. Driving away the Japanese imperialist aggressors and overthrowing the Chiang family dynasty were the results of the people's struggle.
    In the revolutionary years, the broad masses of working people were the revolutionary vanguard. In the period of socialist revolution, they are giants standing tall. In the short two months of part-farming, part-study, we have personally seen that they have never been so spirited and full of fighting spirit as they are today. The broad masses of commune members, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, have a firm stand, clear love and hate, and resolutely follow the socialist road. They are not only the mainstay of class struggle but also heroes of the struggle for production and scientific experimentation. They carried forward the Dazhai spirit, wielding their iron arms to turn the world upside down, opening mountains, splitting ridges, and cutting rivers.
    The people are the real bastion of iron. No matter how fanatically Wu Han sings praises for emperors, kings, generals, and ministers, the history of the working people will never be stained by Wu Han, and the wheel of history will never be reversed!

    把光明和黑暗颠倒了	刘春环　梅玉兰　王福扬
    什么是历史的“光明面”与“黑暗面”呢？吴晗同志说：“有些书也写统治阶级的活动，但只讲其黑暗面，不讲光明的一面。”“……结果，除秦始皇而外，象汉武、唐宗、康熙、乾隆等这样比较全盛时代的领导人物不写或很少描写，于是，历史上的光明面丧失了，写在书上的尽是这个皇朝如何坏，农民起义推翻了它，另一个皇朝起来了，又如何坏，农民起义又推翻了它，一片打倒声，历史几乎成为漆黑一团，灰溜溜的。”在吴晗看来，所谓的“光明面”就是秦皇、汉武、唐宗、康熙等地主阶级头子对劳动人民的残酷统治；“黑暗面”就是农民起义和农民战争。这是对历史的根本歪曲。吴晗认为，封建地主阶级的任何一举一动都是“伟大”的，他们的“良政”决定了历史的发展。封建的御用文人所大力吹捧的什么“文景之治”、“贞观之治”和“开元之治”，就是封建社会的“光明时代”之“杰作”。吴晗在我们今天社会主义革命的时代，声嘶力竭地炫耀封建“圣祖”们治天下的“丰功伟绩”；这究竟是站在什么立场上？替谁呼吁？岂不是很明显了吗？究竟封建统治阶级在历史上形成了怎样的
  “光明面”呢？请看，十三陵的修建过程是一部怎样的劳动人民血泪史吧！
    修每一座陵都需要大量的粗三尺半、高三丈的楠木，楠木采自四川原始森林。采木时经常入山一千人，出山还剩下五百人。修陵还需用石料，每运一块长三丈、宽一丈、厚五尺的石料，就得用十六轮大车，二万民夫，二十八天才能从房山运到北京，这是最短的距离。至于要从千里之外运送建筑材料时，冬天还要用泼水铺冰的方法一步一步拉到北京。据说，永陵每日用四万民夫，修了十二年。修完后，嘉靖皇帝还不满意说：“我的陵就这样吗？”大臣们慌忙逢迎回答：“不，还有一道外罗城呢。”君臣一问一答，给劳动人民增加了多少负担和痛苦啊！统治阶级生前过着挥金如土的生活，死后也想富贵万年，害得劳动人民倾家荡产，流离失所。当地一位社员说：“为了埋皇上一把臭骨头，得换走几万条人命啊！”毛主席说：“地主阶级这样残酷的剥削和压迫所造成的农民的极端穷苦和落后，就是中国社会几千年在经济上和社会生活上停滞不前的基本原因。”地主阶级严重地阻碍了社会历史的发展，他们的罪状罄竹难书，揭露还揭露不完呢，有什么可值得歌颂的呢？
    谁是创造历史的真正主人？人民，只有人民才是创造世界历史的真正动力。万里长城、大运河、敦煌壁画都是劳动人民创造的。赶跑了日本帝国主义侵略军，推翻了蒋家王朝，是人民斗争的结果。
    在革命的年代里，广大的劳动人民是革命先锋，在社会主义革命时期，他们是顶天立地的巨人。在短短两个月的半农半读中，我们亲眼看到，他们从来没有象今天这样意气风发，斗志昂扬。广大社员，特别是贫下中农立场坚定，爱憎分明，坚决走社会主义道路。他们不但是阶级斗争的中流砥柱，而且是生产斗争、科学实验的英雄。他们发扬了大寨精神，挥动铁臂翻大地，开山劈岭斩江河。
    人民群众是真正的铜墙铁壁，不管吴晗怎样狂热地为帝王将相高唱赞歌，劳动人民的历史，决不允许吴晗沾染，历史的车轮决不会倒转！
