Comrades:
    The focus of this meeting of responsible comrades from various counties convened by the Provincial Party Committee is to discuss how to emphasize politics, using politics to command the economy, command business, and command technology; to discuss how to highlight politics and how to further develop the movement to study Chairman Mao's works. Comrades criticized the Provincial Party Committee for not grasping this aspect sufficiently in the past. This criticism is correct. The comrades of the various county Party committees checked and said that the political and ideological work was not well grasped in the past, so the responsibility lies first with the Provincial Party Committee. The shortcomings and errors of the Provincial Party Committee's leadership can be listed in one hundred or one thousand items, but the most important one is that the emphasis on politics is not enough. This must be resolutely changed, and quickly. Especially leading cadres above the county level, should strive to overcome this shortcoming and error. The Provincial Party Committee has already issued instructions on the issue of highlighting politics, placing the highlighting of politics and the large-scale study of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of our year's leadership work. Of course, saying this does not mean that we did not highlight politics in the past, and there was no political command at all, but rather that the highlighting of politics was not enough, and the political command was not enough. When comrades are examining the shortcomings and errors in their work, it is good and necessary to demand themselves with a strict spirit and seriously criticize the shortcomings and errors in our work. We cannot forgive ourselves and ignore our shortcomings and errors, especially such important shortcomings and errors, just because we have achievements in our work. However, conversely, we cannot exaggerate either. On this issue, we must also follow Chairman Mao's teachings, and use the method of "one divides into two" to comprehensively summarize our work.
    Regarding the relationship between politics and the economy, politics and business, and politics and technology, many comrades are still not very clear, their positions are not properly placed, and there are tendencies of eclecticism and other erroneous ideas. Some comrades are always discussing production in terms of production, and are always very interested in production progress and manure accumulation figures, while they are not very interested in class struggle and the ideological problems of party members, cadres, and the people. Discussing production in terms of production, only looking at the quality of seedlings, without talking about class and class struggle, is essentially a manifestation of pragmatism. Of course, this is not to say that these comrades are engaged in eclecticism, pragmatism, or revisionism. For the vast majority of cadres in our party, it is not this problem, but a problem of understanding. That is to say, some of our comrades, including myself, have not studied Chairman Mao's works well enough, our political and ideological level is not high enough, and our methods of thinking are more metaphysical and less dialectical. We have blindness on certain issues, and our sense of smell is not sensitive. Therefore, we must strive to reduce blindness and increase awareness.
    Now, based on the opinions raised by everyone, I will talk about the following issues:
    Why should we emphasize politics and use politics to command everything?
    Emphasize politics, put politics in command, politics must command everything, not anything else. This is not the proposition of any one person, nor is it an arbitrary policy, or a slogan put forward casually. What is politics? Chairman Mao's definition of politics is: Politics, whether revolutionary or counter-revolutionary, is a class struggle against a class. The struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie is proletarian politics, and the struggle of the bourgeoisie against the proletariat is bourgeois politics. Our party is the political party of the proletariat, and has always been engaged in class struggle, and has always been determined to use proletarian politics to lead everything and command everything. Before the national liberation, our party led the masses of people in the new-democratic revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and seized power through armed struggle. This is of course politics. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, our country entered a new period of socialist revolution and socialist construction. We carried out land reform, suppressed counter-revolutionaries, and conducted the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements. These are all revolutions, all politics. From the confiscation of bureaucratic capital to the socialist transformation of agriculture, capitalist industry and commerce, and handicrafts, this was a great socialist revolution. This revolution was carried out under the dictatorship of the proletariat, led by the Communist Party and the broad masses of workers and peasants. This revolutionary movement not only changed the ownership system and laid the socialist economic foundation, but also simultaneously carried out the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. In 1957, the bourgeoisie launched a wild attack on us, and we carried out the anti-rightist struggle and launched a rectification movement within the party. This was to make the superstructure more adapted to the needs of the economic base. All of this is revolution, a life-and-death struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist and capitalist roads. This series of revolutionary movements were carried out under the leadership of the Party, under the command of proletarian politics.
    The Great Leap Forward began in 1958. In January of that year, Chairman Mao proposed that our comrades should not be empty-headed politicians, but should be both red and expert. "Red" means good politics, and "expert" means good business. Chairman Mao proposed to learn some business, to learn how to do economic work, and at the same time he proposed not to neglect politics and ideological work because we want to learn some business and learn some technology, and become lost realists. He demanded that our cadres be both red and expert, and lead with "redness." In 1957, Chairman Mao pointed out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "A correct political viewpoint is like a soul."① Politics is the commander, the soul. Chairman Mao also repeatedly taught us: Socialist society is a very long historical period, that is, the historical period from capitalism to communism (this period may take decades, hundreds of years, or even longer). In such a long historical period, there are still classes, class contradictions and class struggles, and there are struggles between the socialist and capitalist roads. Class and class struggle are objectively existing. If you forget it and ignore it, will it be calm and without struggle? No, "the trees want to be still, but the wind will not stop." If we neglect or forget the class struggle, capitalist forces and feudal remnants will launch a wild attack on us, and class enemies will use methods of attack from within and pull out, to corrupt, invade, and disintegrate our party, and at the same time corrupt, divide and disintegrate workers and peasants. Then, as Chairman Mao said: "It will not take much time, a few years, a dozen years, or several decades at most, and a national counter-revolutionary restoration will inevitably occur. The Marxist-Leninist party will surely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the entire China will change color."② Chairman Mao has talked about the issue of class struggle countless times in his writings and speeches. In 1962, he again talked about class, class contradictions, and class struggle. From that time on, we began to grasp the socialist education movement, which has been going on for three years now, and will continue in the future. We must carry out the socialist revolution to the end, until the three differences are eliminated and communism is realized. Carrying out the socialist education movement means engaging in class struggle. This is politics, this is putting politics in command. In class society, what is the driving force of social development? It is class struggle. This is the fundamental principle of Marxism. Class still exists in socialist society, so the driving force of social development is still class struggle. This is a very significant development of the principles of Marxism-Leninism by Chairman Mao, a new and great contribution. If we highlight politics, grasp the struggle between two classes and two roads, we can make our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction develop smoothly, ensure the building of socialism, and create conditions for the transition to communism. If we do not grasp the struggle between two classes and two roads, do not grasp this main contradiction, and do not solve this main contradiction, revisionism will come to power, capitalism will be restored, and China will retreat to the tragic state of semi-feudal and semi-colonial society. Therefore, the only guarantee that the socialist revolution can be carried out to the end and that socialist construction can be successfully completed and transitioned to communism is to grasp the main contradiction between the two classes and two roads and solve it thoroughly.
    The relationship between politics and production is what we usually call grasping revolution and promoting production. Comrades have all gone through practice, these are all things you have personally experienced, please recall, isn't it true that every time we grasp revolution, grasp political command, and grasp the struggle between two roads well, our production develops quickly and well? Whenever we do not grasp politics, do not grasp revolution, or do not grasp it well, our production will not be good, and other work will not be good either. The Great Leap Forward in 1958 emerged on the basis of the anti-rightist struggle in the cities and the socialist education in the countryside in 1957, grasping the struggle between two roads, and conducting large-scale debates and rectification of the party. The broad masses of cadres and people had high revolutionary enthusiasm, were high-spirited, and full of energy, creating countless human miracles. As Chairman Mao described in his poem "Farewell to the God of Plague": "Spring breezes warm ten thousand willow branches, six hundred million in this sacred land all equal Yao and Shun," "Silver hoes fall on the Heavenly Ridges, iron arms shake the Three Rivers." These are all the results of putting politics in command. Were there any problems in the work in 1958? There were. Because our minds were feverish, some mistakes appeared in our work. Chairman Mao said in 1958: We must break superstitions, liberate our minds, go all out, seek truth from facts, combine work and rest, do political and ideological work, not engage in coercion and commandism, care for the lives of the masses, and pay attention to working methods. The root cause of our mistakes is that we did not listen to Chairman Mao's words well, and did not earnestly and honestly act according to his instructions. The real political command is the command of Mao Zedong Thought. The reason why we make mistakes in our work is because the political command is not enough, not well enough, and it is definitely not because the political command is too much or bad.
    The reason why our political command was not good, or did not rise up, was mainly in 1961 and 1962. During this period, we corrected the errors and shortcomings in our work, and earnestly implemented a series of policies of the Party Central Committee on the People's Communes, which played a good role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses. This is completely correct. During the discussion at the meeting, some people seemed to think that these policies of the Party can be discarded, which is very wrong. The problem is that from 1961 to before the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962, we only focused on grasping specific policies, grasping production, and grasping life, neglecting class struggle, and neglecting the struggle between two roads. Therefore, capitalist forces and feudal remnants took the opportunity to launch a wild attack on us. The class struggle in society was also reflected within the party, and some party members and cadres were corrupted. In those two years, our biggest mistake was not grasping class struggle, and not emphasizing relying on poor and lower-middle peasants. Of course, we also said verbally that we should put politics in command, and that we should grasp class struggle. Saying is one thing, whether we have seriously grasped it is another. At that time, we talked about three adherences: adhering to the socialist direction, adhering to the class line, and adhering to technical reform. However, if you say that, it does not mean that you have no responsibility. You say you want to adhere to the three, how to adhere to them? What do you oppose? Without investigation, without going down to squat, we could not realize the seriousness, complexity, and long-term nature of class struggle, and always thought that the problem was not serious. In the autumn of 1962, Chairman Mao put forward the issue of class, class contradictions, and class struggle, but some of our comrades did not deeply understand Chairman Mao's teachings, and said that the problems in Hubei Province were not serious. After these years of socialist education movement, we have increasingly clearly seen that Hubei is not without class struggle, but it has, and it is quite serious in some areas. We have increasingly clearly seen that the struggle between classes and the struggle between two roads are long-term. After the socialist education movement, we still need to put politics in command, and still need to grasp the main contradiction between the two classes and two roads, and continue the revolution.
    From the winter of 1962, we emphasized grasping class struggle. However, we did not grasp it very well in 1963, and we did not grasp it very well in the first half of 1964. It was not until the second half of 1964 that we grasped it better. But whether class struggle is serious or not, it cannot be said that there is already a unified understanding on this issue. For many comrades, the lack of understanding of the seriousness, complexity, and long-term nature of class struggle is still the main issue. Chairman Mao said that grasping class struggle is effective, which is an unshakeable truth. Our province increased production in 1962, which can be regarded as a bumper harvest; but 1963, 1964, and 1965 were the years with the fastest production development since our liberation. Have the comrades present here thought about such an increase in production? Why is there such a great development in production? Isn't it because we carried out the socialist education movement, grasped class struggle, grasped revolution, and mobilized the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and people, thus promoting production! If we did not carry out the socialist education movement, could we have such a result? I think it is absolutely impossible.
    Looking back at history, in 1953, our province's agricultural production also had a relatively rapid development. Why was the production good in that year? Wasn't it because we carried out land reform and suppressed counter-revolutionaries in 1951 and 1952, and carried out the "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movements in the cities? In 1954, there was a major flood. The situation in 1955 was not good, simply because right-leaning thought was at work. In the winter of 1955, according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, we grasped agricultural cooperation, opposed "small-footed women," formulated a twelve-year plan based on the "National Agricultural Development Program" of forty articles, and greatly grasped technical reform, which greatly promoted the development of production. Practical experience proves that what Chairman Mao said: Revolution is the liberation of productive forces, revolution is the promotion of the development of productive forces, and grasping class struggle is effective, is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. If we have made mistakes in the past, taken some detours, hit some snags, lacked understanding, and had many blind spots, now we must recognize the truth that Chairman Mao taught us through summarizing our practical experience and our personal experiences: We must put political work in the first place, and we must use politics to command everything.
    How to use politics to command all work
    Some comrades have raised that they understand the principle of putting political work in the first place and using politics to command the economy, business, and technology, but they don't know how to do it. It cannot be said that there is no reason for raising this question. However, the primary problem is still to clarify the principle of political command, whether it is a true understanding rather than a false understanding. As long as you truly understand this principle, specific methods will emerge in practice. Now we already have a lot of good experience in this regard. Whether in the military or in the local area, there are many advanced units and advanced figures. In particular, the recent report introduced the deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, the former Secretary of the Lankao County Party Committee in Henan Province. He studied and applied Chairman Mao's works in a lively way, led the masses to work hard and change the face of Lankao, setting a shining example for us. I heard that everyone was very moved when studying his deeds, and felt that they were very insufficient compared to him when checking their own thoughts and work style. This is very good, we must have this spirit. Chairman Mao called on our entire party to learn from the People's Liberation Army. What should we learn? We should learn how the People's Liberation Army highlights politics, does political and ideological work, and studies and applies Chairman Mao's works in a lively way. The People's Liberation Army has countless advanced figures, advanced deeds, and good examples to learn from. In the local area, industry has Daqing and agriculture has Dazhai, and we must also learn seriously. How to learn from Daqing, how to learn from Dazhai, and what to learn from them? Comrade Li Xuefeng told me that the experience of Dazhai can be summarized clearly in a few sentences: Because there is a Dazhai-style party branch, there are Dazhai-style people (advanced farmers with socialist consciousness), therefore a Dazhai-style advanced unit was created. Some comrades in the discussion often put politics and production in opposition, as if grasping political work will relax production, and grasping political work well will damage production. Looking at the problem like this is one-sided and metaphysical. Politics and production are a unity of opposites, and if political command is good, the spirit will turn into matter, and production will be good, not the opposite. I don't believe that there is any unit with bad political and ideological work, but the collective production is done very well. Conversely, if the Party branch of this brigade is very good, the political and ideological work is done very well, the cadres and members of the community have a high degree of socialist consciousness, and are very enthusiastic, but the production is done very badly, I don't believe it either. If any of you believe there is such a strange thing, please provide a typical material! How should the relationship between politics and economy, politics and business, and politics and technology be stated? For rural work, I wonder if it can be stated as follows: Hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take class struggle and the struggle between two roads as the key link, and grasp the three major revolutions simultaneously. Under the unified plan and unified leadership of the state, boldly mobilize the masses, carry forward the Dazhai spirit, go all out, aim high, and build a new socialist countryside quickly, well, and economically. This is taking class struggle as the key link, grasping class struggle, the struggle for production, and the scientific experiment three major revolutions together. Is it feasible to propose and do it this way? Please consider it, comrades.
    Some comrades are arguing: Is politics the purpose, or is production the purpose? If production is the purpose, what is politics? Some comrades say that politics is the means and production is the purpose, so politics serves production. Some comrades say that politics is the purpose and production is the means. Generally speaking, politics is the superstructure, which serves the economic base. At the same time, politics is also the concentrated expression of the economy. If it is simplified to politics serves production, production is the purpose, and politics is the means, that is wrong. "Serving production," what "production" is it serving? We are communists, and the Communist Party has its own goals. What is our ultimate purpose? It is to build our People's Republic of China into a strong socialist country, to actively support world revolution, to overthrow imperialism and all reactionaries, and to realize a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, and without exploitation. The purpose of our putting politics in command is for this, and the purpose of economic construction is also for this. In short, we must not only build our country well, but also support world revolution and liberate all mankind, and realize communism throughout the world. This is our ultimate purpose.
    Some comrades raised the relationship between people and things. Our comrades in the army understand this issue best. Chairman Mao has talked about this issue many times. Last year, Comrade Lin Biao published an important article, "Long Live the Victory of People's War," which thoroughly expounded Chairman Mao's principle that the human factor is the first in revolutionary war. We used millet plus rifles to defeat the Kuomintang's airplanes and artillery, which were equipped by the Americans with weapons, money, and an advisory group to command them. We had fewer troops and poorer equipment, but we defeated the powerful Kuomintang reactionaries. What is the reason? It is because we are revolutionary people and a revolutionary army, putting political ideology first, and the human factor first, carrying out a revolutionary war, and giving full play to people's subjective initiative. Isn't the same true in South Vietnam? Isn't it the poorly equipped people's army and guerrillas that defeated the powerful US imperialism and the South Vietnamese reactionaries? Throughout history, all revolutionary wars have confirmed the universal truth that the human factor is the first. Of course, fighting a war does not deny the role of material factors, such as weapons and ammunition, but when comparing people and things, the human factor is the first. Fighting a war relies on people, so isn't the human factor the first in socialist construction? We also do not deny the material factors in production. Without land, seeds, fertilizers, draught cattle, and farm tools, without the necessary means of production, how can we produce? However, we must know that productive forces are composed of laborers and means of production. Productive forces themselves are a unity of opposites between people and things, and the human factor is the most vivid and active factor. Under the exploitative system, laborers are not only the slaves of the exploiters, but also the slaves of the means of production. The enthusiasm of the laborers has been greatly suppressed or destroyed. Only after the socialist revolution, with the realization of the public ownership of the means of production, the laborers became the masters of the society, and the masters of the means of production, can the enthusiasm and creativity of the laborers be brought into full play to the greatest extent. This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. Comrades all know many such examples: The same land, farm tools, and climate conditions, but the results of production are often very different. Some produce more than two hundred catties of cotton per mu, while others only produce dozens of catties. Isn't this the human factor first? The objective conditions of Daqing and Dazhai are not good, but they have become models for the whole country to learn from. Isn't this the human factor first? Why do we emphasize political work, and emphasize doing ideological work for people? It is to educate farmers to farm for the revolution, to farm for building a strong socialist country, and to farm for supporting the world revolution, standing at the doorstep, seeing Tiananmen Square, having the motherland in mind, and having the world in view. We use socialist ideas and the idea of carrying the revolution to the end to educate farmers, and fight against the spontaneous tendencies of capitalism. This is the main content of our political and ideological work for farmers.
    How to boost energy? We rely on doing political and ideological work, plus caring for people's lives, relying on these two things to boost the energy of the people. Which of these two is more important? Raising the socialist consciousness of farmers, raising the consciousness of farmers to farm for the revolution is the main thing, and should be put in the first place, which is called putting politics in command. At the same time, we must implement the principle of distribution according to work and equivalent exchange (in the socialist stage). This is what Chairman Mao said: Putting political work in the first place must also implement the necessary distribution according to work. Here, we have a principled distinction from revisionism. Khrushchev's revisionists always talk about material incentives, and put money in command, and do not talk about revolution or politics at all. If they talk about politics, it is revisionist politics. The result is the disintegration of the Soviet socialist economy, and a reversion to capitalism. Some comrades say that since we are talking about putting politics in command, it seems that work assessment, production team accounting, and improving people's lives can all be dispensed with. This is a misunderstanding, and it is wrong. If our socialism develops production and develops the economy, what do we do if we do not improve the people's lives? Production also has a purpose! If people's lives cannot be improved, where is the superiority of the socialist system manifested? Collective ownership and ownership by the whole people make the working people the masters of the means of production and the masters of the machines. They produce for themselves, for the collective, for the country, and for supporting the world revolution. Our party's policy is to correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual. This is a problem of distribution, and it is also a political problem. Only by correctly implementing these policies can the people more clearly see the consistency between individual interests and the overall and long-term interests of socialism based on their own vital interests, thereby loving the socialist motherland more, strengthening patriotism and internationalism; can we mobilize the socialist production enthusiasm of the masses, and can we consolidate the worker-peasant alliance. Matter transforms into spirit, and spirit transforms into matter. This is a unity of opposites, and comrades must not understand this problem one-sidedly.
    Energy can be boosted but not leaked. The problem is what kind of energy to boost. We must boost the correct energy, not the wrong energy, we must boost energy according to the party's policies, and we must be good at combining revolutionary enthusiasm with the spirit of seeking truth. Of course, people who lack revolutionary enthusiasm, are satisfied with the status quo, are content with being in the middle, or are backward and complacent, cannot have the spirit of seeking truth. Comrade Jiao Yulu came with full revolutionary enthusiasm to explore the reality of Lankao County, to see how Lankao County's "three harms" were caused, and through investigation and research, put forward correct measures, and led cadres and the people to fight against the "three harms," and strive to change the face of Lankao. If we do what Comrade Jiao Yulu did, it is putting politics in command and putting Mao Zedong Thought in command; if we don't do this, it may be putting individualism in command. A party has a question of what to put in command, and a person also has a question of what to put in command. If it is not the command of proletarian ideology, it is the command of bourgeois ideology. If a party, a leading body, or a person is not dominated by this kind of ideology, it will be dominated by that kind of ideology. Haven't you all made comparisons this time? We have some relatively advanced counties, districts, communes, and brigades in Hubei, and we also have a number of relatively backward counties, districts, communes, and brigades. It is inevitable that things have these three states of advanced, intermediate, and backward. But we must do work and constantly change it, to make the advanced more advanced, to make the intermediate catch up with the advanced, and to make the backward change their faces and catch up. Why are some areas advanced, and why are some areas always backward? Comrades can summarize the experiences and lessons. I think, isn't it a main reason whether politics is in command, whether it is in command well, and whether class struggle and the struggle between two roads have been carried out? Most of the backward areas are places where capitalist ideology is rampant, and they lack the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and lack the ambition to change the world. The Provincial Party Committee put forward the slogan of "major reform, major increase in production, minor reform, minor increase in production, no reform, no increase in production" in 1959, emphasizing reform, and the direction was correct. But later, we reformed improperly in some places, and made some mistakes. Therefore, when the Provincial Party Committee summarized the experiences and lessons in 1960, it added a sentence: "Reckless reform will reduce production." This is more comprehensive. Practice has proven that those who correctly recognize the achievements and mistakes in the Great Leap Forward, correctly accept the experiences and lessons, hold high the red banner of the General Line, and truly do it according to these four sentences, have recovered and developed production very quickly in recent years; those who do not do this, are afraid, are steady, dare not reform, and even abandon what is right, do not want good seeds, do not engage in strip planting, and do not run water conservancy projects, such places have made very little progress, or no progress, and even regressed. Of course, our Provincial Party Committee is responsible for backward areas, and the help is not enough. I hope that comrades will not be anxious or discouraged. We must cheer up, carefully summarize the experiences and lessons, and do it solidly according to Chairman Mao's instructions: a clear situation, a firm determination, the right method.
    The Provincial Party Committee has repeatedly stated that the provincial, prefectural, and county party committees must put political and ideological work in the first place of all work, highlight politics, and grasp political and ideological work firmly, and grasp fewer specific things in production. The production links, the distribution of machines, and the distribution of fertilizers should be left to the business departments. I especially emphasized that I hope you will not be interested in production progress and fertilizer accumulation figures for the rest of your lives. Some comrades misunderstood what I said, saying: If you say this, our county party committee will not have to grasp production. Who said that the county party committee does not have to grasp production? Didn't we say that we must be both red and expert, and learn some business and learn some science? If we lead agricultural production, we must learn some basic knowledge of agricultural production. What I said was that we want the responsible comrades of our party committees to grasp more political and ideological work and less daily production, business, and technical work, and less bureaucracy, not that we want the county party committee not to grasp production, not to lead production. We must grasp the three major revolutions simultaneously, how can the county party committee not grasp production? Didn't Comrade Jiao Yulu grasp production? We must grasp the major issues in production like him, not the minor issues. The county party secretary must not replace the "production team leader." Our socialist education movement is to take class struggle as the key link, and engage in both production and scientific experiments. In the future, we must do this for all our points and squattings.
    What should the Party committee focus on grasping in political and ideological work? I think that we cannot grasp it if we talk too much. It is to grasp the five things that the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao put forward that cannot be forgotten, namely: we must not forget class struggle, we must not forget the dictatorship of the proletariat, we must not forget relying on poor and lower-middle peasants, we must not forget the Party's policies, and we must not forget the Party's work. This year, next year, and forever, the Party committee must grasp these five things that cannot be forgotten, and this will be putting politics in command. The Party committee regularly grasps the work in these five aspects, discusses the work in these five aspects, and checks the work in these five aspects. I think that as long as the work in these five aspects is grasped well, we can mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of cadres and the broad masses of people, we can give full play to their creativity, and we can ensure that production will be done well. If the work in these five aspects is not grasped well, even if we discuss production problems every day, production will not be done well.
    Specifically, how to grasp it below, we have not done well enough in the past, you make self-criticism, and we must also make self-criticism. In the future, when we go down to check work, if we find that a team's production is not good, and it is a backward team, we must first ask why the production is not good? We must investigate the Party branch, investigate the poor and lower-middle peasants, and see what the class struggle is like in this area, what the ideological style of the cadres and party members is like, and what life problems and ideological problems the poor and lower-middle peasants have. Look for the reasons for the backwardness of production from these aspects, rather than discussing production in terms of production. First, we must find the reasons from the political and ideological aspects, or whether the leadership cares about the lives of the masses, and we must also find the reasons from the policy aspects, to see which regulations in the policy hinder the enthusiasm of the masses. Once the reasons are found and resolved, the backwardness of production can be changed. As for whether there are still problems in production and technology? There will be some, generally speaking, these problems are secondary. As long as the problems in the above five aspects are resolved, let the cadres and the masses discuss the problems of production and technology. Believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and these problems can be easily solved. Separated from the ideological problems of cadres, poor and lower-middle peasants, discussing production in terms of production, not grasping the active thinking, not doing the ideological work of the masses, and not caring about the lives of the poor and lower-middle peasants, even if problems in production technology are discovered, they cannot be solved. There is also a struggle between advanced and backward ideas in production technology. Only by solving the ideological problems of the majority of cadres and the masses through persuasion, discussion, and experimentation, can the problems in production technology be solved.
    The meeting discussed the "Five Goods" and the "Compare, Learn, Catch Up, Help, and Surpass" campaign. We must widely carry out this movement, have a good start, and be red to the end! Can the slogan be proposed like this: "Take the Five Goods as the goal, compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass." Carry out this movement, one helps one, one pair is red, one red flag leads one area, and one hundred red flags lead the entire county. Advanced units should help the relatively backward units, you catch up with me, I help you, and I hope you surpass me. What to compare, what to learn, what to catch up with, what to help, and what to surpass, all take the Five Goods as the goal. Who is advanced and who is backward, all take the Five Goods as the standard. Good political ideology is the first condition among the Five Goods. Do not take how much production is increased or how high the yield per unit is as the first. Doing it this way grasps political and ideological work, and grasps the three major revolutions with class struggle as the key link, rather than putting them in opposition to each other and isolating one problem at a time.
    Regarding the issue of studying Chairman Mao's works
    The practice of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, as well as the practice of the world revolution, has proved and will continue to prove that Mao Zedong Thought is the universal truth of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. In the history of our party, whenever Mao Zedong Thought was in command, the revolution developed and moved towards victory; whenever Mao Zedong Thought was not in command, the revolution suffered setbacks and failures. The history of more than ten years since liberation has also proved this truth. In various regions, various departments, and various tasks, where Mao Zedong Thought is well in command, the work is good; where Mao Zedong Thought is poorly in command, the work is poor; and where Mao Zedong Thought is not in command, it will inevitably embark on a wrong path. The so-called political command is the command of Mao Zedong Thought. We must link highlighting politics, studying Chairman Mao's works, the socialist education movement, and cultivating revolutionary successors. These are all highlighting politics and putting politics in command. Without studying Chairman Mao's works and without using Mao Zedong Thought to command, it is empty talk to shout slogans of putting politics in command, or it is putting bourgeois politics in command.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of the development of contemporary Marxism-Leninism. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest instruction for all our work at home, and it is also our guide for observing and handling world revolutionary issues. How should we look at domestic issues, look at world issues, and understand the international situation? We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze and judge, otherwise we will not have a correct understanding. Now the class relations and class forces in the world are undergoing great turmoil, great division, and great reorganization; US imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary nationalism are engaging in a great anti-China chorus. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers, revisionism is a paper tiger, and the atomic bomb is also a paper tiger. They are superficially powerful, baring their teeth and claws, and are fierce, but they are actually very weak and are all dying things. We must remember: It is a good thing, not a bad thing, that the enemy opposes us and scolds us. The more fiercely he scolds, the more it proves that we are correct, revolutionary, and are true Marxists-Leninists. If the revisionists do not scold us, flatter us, and praise us, then we are almost the same as them, and we become revisionists or semi-revisionists. Imperialism, revisionism, and

    突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切
    （一九六六年二月十二日在湖北省农村工作会议上的讲话）
    王任重同志们：
    这次省委召开各县负责同志参加的会议，重点是讨论如何突出政治，以政治统帅经济、统帅业务、统帅技术这个问题，讨论怎样突出政治，怎样进一步开展学习毛主席著作的运动。同志们批评省委过去对这方面抓得不够，这个批评是正确的。各县委的同志检查，说过去对政治思想工作抓得不好，那么，责任首先在省委。省委领导工作上的缺点、错误可以摆一百条、一千条，但最主要的一条就是突出政治不够。这一条必须坚决改，快改。特别是县以上的领导干部，要努力克服这个缺点、错误。省委已就突出政治的问题发了指示，把突出政治、大抓学习毛主席著作，摆在我们全年领导工作的第一位。当然，这样讲，并不是说我们过去就是没有突出政治，根本就没有政治挂帅，而是说突出政治不够，政治挂帅不够。同志们在检查工作中的缺点、错误的时候，以从严的精神要求自己，严肃地批评我们工作中的缺点、错误，是好的，也是必要的。不能因为我们工作中有成绩，就原谅自己，忽视我们的缺点、错误，特别是这样重要的缺点、错误。可是，反过来说，也不能夸大。在这个问题上，也要按照毛主席的教导，用一分为二的方法，来全面地总结我们的工作。
    对于政治与经济，政治与业务，政治与技术的关系问题，还有不少同志不那么清楚，位置没有摆正，有折中主义以及其他的错误思想。有些同志总是就生产论生产，总是对生产进度、积肥数字等非常感兴趣，而对阶级斗争，对党员、干部和人民群众的思想问题，兴趣就不很高。就生产论生产，只看禾苗好坏，不讲阶级，不讲阶级斗争，这实质上是实用主义的一种表现。当然，这并不是说，这些同志是在搞折中主义、实用主义、修正主义。就我们党内绝大多数干部来说，不是这个问题，而是认识问题。这就是说，我们有些同志，包括我个人在内，对毛主席著作学得不够好，政治思想水平不够高，思想方法上形而上学多一些，辩证法少一些。我们在某些问题上有盲目性，嗅觉不灵。因此，我们要力求减少盲目性，提高自觉性。
    现在根据大家提出的意见，讲以下几个问题：
    为什么要突出政治，用政治统帅一切
    突出政治，政治挂帅，政治要统帅一切，而不是别的统帅一切。这不是哪一个人的主张，也不是一个任意的政策，或随便提出的口号。什么是政治？毛主席给政治下的定义是：政治，不论革命的和反革命的，都是阶级对阶级的斗争。无产阶级对资产阶级的斗争是无产阶级政治，资产阶级对无产阶级的斗争是资产阶级政治。我们的党是无产阶级的政党，从来就是抓阶级斗争的，从来就是要用无产阶级的政治领导一切、统帅一切的。全国解放以前，我们党领导了人民大众反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义的新民主主义革命，武装夺取政权，这当然是政治。一九四九年，中华人民共和国成立以后，我国进入了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的新时期。我们搞土地改革，搞镇压反革命，搞三反、五反，这都是革命，都是政治。从没收官僚资本到农业合作化、资本主义工商业和手工业社会主义改造，这是一场伟大的社会主义革命。这个革命，是在无产阶级专政的条件下，由共产党领导广大工人农民群众进行的。这次革命运动，不仅改变了所有制，奠定了社会主义的经济基础，而且在政治战线上和思想战线上也同时进行了社会主义革命。一九五七年，资产阶级向我们猖狂进攻，我们进行了反右派斗争，并且在党内开展了整风运动，这是为了使上层建筑更加适应经济基础的需要。所有这一切，都是革命，是无产阶级和资产阶级两个阶级之间、社会主义和资本主义两条道路之间你死我活的斗争。这一系列的革命运动，都是在党的领导下，在无产阶级的政治统帅下进行的。
    一九五八年开始大跃进。那年一月间，毛主席提出，我们的同志不要做空头政治家，要又红又专。红就是政治好，专就是业务好。毛主席提出要学点业务，要学会做经济工作，同时又提出不要因为要学点业务，学点技术，就忽视政治，忽视思想工作，变成迷失方向的实际家。他要求我们的干部又红又专，以红带专。一九五七年，毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》中指出：“没有正确的政治观点，就等于没有灵魂。”①政治是统帅，是灵魂。毛主席还一再教导我们：社会主义社会是一个很长的历史时期，也就是从资本主义过渡到共产主义的历史时期（这个时期可能需要几十年、上百年甚至更长的时间）。在这样长的历史时期内，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。阶级与阶级斗争是客观存在的，你忘记了它，忽视了它，是不是就会风平浪静没有斗争了呢？不，“树欲静而风不止”。我们忽视或忘记了阶级斗争，资本主义势力和封建残余势力就会向我们猖狂进攻，阶级敌人就会用打进来、拉出去的办法，腐蚀、侵袭、瓦解我们的党，同时对工人、农民也进行腐蚀和分化瓦解，那就会象毛主席所说的：“不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”②毛主席在他的著作、讲话中无数次地讲过阶级斗争的问题。一九六二年又讲了阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争。从那个时候起，我们就开始抓社会主义教育运动，到现在已经搞了三年了，今后还要继续搞。要把社会主义革命进行到底，一直搞到三个差别消灭、共产主义实现为止。搞社会主义教育运动，就是搞阶级斗争，这就是政治，就是政治挂帅。在阶级社会里，社会发展的动力是什么？是阶级斗争。这是马克思主义的根本原理。社会主义社会仍然存在着阶级，因此社会发展的动力，仍然是阶级斗争。这是毛主席对马克思列宁主义原理的一个十分重大的发展，是一个新的巨大的贡献。我们突出政治，抓住两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，就能使我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业顺利地向前发展，保证建成社会主义，为过渡到共产主义创造条件。如果不抓两个阶级、两条道路的斗争，不抓住这个主要矛盾，不解决这个主要矛盾，修正主义就要当权，资本主义就会复辟，中国就要退回到半封建、半殖民地社会的悲惨状况。所以，社会主义革命能不能进行到底，社会主义建设能不能胜利地完成，并且过渡到共产主义，唯一的保证就是要抓住两个阶级、两条道路之间的斗争这个主要矛盾，加以彻底解决。
    政治和生产的关系，就是我们通常所讲的抓革命、促生产。同志们都经过实践，这都是你们亲身经历过的事，请你们回想一下，是不是每当我们抓革命、抓政治挂帅抓得好的时候，我们的生产就发展得快、发展得好？凡是不抓政治、不抓革命或者抓得不好的时候，我们的生产就搞不好，其他各项工作也搞不好。一九五八年的大跃进，是在一九五七年城市反右派斗争，农村搞社会主义教育，抓两条道路的斗争，搞大鸣大放大辩论，整风整党的基础上出现的。广大干部和人民群众的革命热情很高，意气风发，干劲冲天，创造出无数的人间奇迹。正如毛主席在《送瘟神》那首诗中所形容的：“春风杨柳万千条，六亿神州尽舜尧”，“天连五岭银锄落，地动三河铁臂摇。”这都是政治挂帅的结果。一九五八年工作中有没有问题呢？也有。由于我们脑子发热，在工作中出现了这样或那样的一些错误。毛主席在一九五八年讲过：要破除迷信，解放思想，鼓足干劲，实事求是，劳逸结合，要做政治思想工作，不搞强迫命令，要关心群众生活，注意工作方法。我们犯错误，归根到底，就是因为没有好好听毛主席的话，没有认真地、老老实实地按照他的指示办事。真正的政治挂帅，就是毛泽东思想挂帅。我们工作中之所以犯错误，是由于政治挂帅不够，挂得不好，决不是政治挂帅挂多了挂坏的。
    我们政治挂帅挂得不好，或者说没有挂起来，最主要的还是一九六一年和一九六二年这两年。我们这个时期纠正了工作中的错误和缺点，认真贯彻执行了党中央关于人民公社的一系列政策，对调动广大群众的积极性起了好的作用。这是完全正确的。会议讨论中，有些人好象认为党的这些政策又可以不要了，这是十分错误的。问题是从一九六一年到一九六二年党的八届十中全会以前，我们只顾了抓具体政策，抓生产，抓生活，忽视了阶级斗争，忽视了两条道路的斗争，因此，资本主义势力和封建残余势力乘机向我们猖狂进攻。社会上的阶级斗争也反映到党内，一部分党员、干部受到了腐蚀侵袭。那两年，我们最大的错误就是没有抓住阶级斗争，没有强调依靠贫农、下中农。当然，我们口头上也讲过要政治挂帅，要抓阶级斗争。讲是一回事，有没有认真抓是另一回事。我们那时讲过三个坚持：坚持社会主义方向，坚持阶级路线，坚持技术改革。但是，你那样讲了，并不等于你就没有责任了。你说要三个坚持，怎样坚持呢？反对什么东西呢？没有调查，没有下去蹲点，因此对阶级斗争的严重性、复杂性、长期性认识不到，总以为问题不严重。一九六二年秋季，毛主席提出阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，可是我们有些同志，对毛主席的教导体会不深刻，说我们湖北省问题不严重。经过这几年的社会主义教育运动，我们越来越清楚地看到：湖北不是没有阶级斗争，而是有，并且在一部分地区还相当严重。越来越清楚地看到：阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争是长期的，社会主义教育运动之后，仍然要政治挂帅，仍然要抓住两个阶级和两条道路之间的斗争这个主要矛盾，不断革命。
    从一九六二年冬天起，我们强调了抓阶级斗争。不过一九六三年抓得不大好，一九六四年上半年也抓得不大好，从一九六四年下半年起，才抓得比较好一些。但阶级斗争到底严重不严重，这个问题还不能说都已经有了统一的认识。目前就许多同志来说，对阶级斗争的严重性、复杂性、长期性认识不足，这还是主要的。毛主席讲的阶级斗争一抓就灵，这是颠扑不破的真理。我们省一九六二年是增产的，也算是丰收的；可是一九六三年、一九六四年和一九六五年，这三年是我们解放以来生产发展最快的。这样的增产，在座的同志有没有想到过？为什么生产有这样大的发展呢？这还不是因为开展社会主义教育运动，抓阶级斗争，抓革命，调动了广大干部和人民群众的积极性，促进了生产！如果不搞社会主义教育运动，能不能有这样的结果呢？我看决不可能。
    回想历史上，一九五三年我们省的农业生产也有过较快的发展。那一年生产为什么好？还不是因为一九五一年、一九五二年搞了土地改革、镇压反革命，城市搞了三反、五反。一九五四年大水灾。一九五五年情况不好，无非是右倾思想作怪。一九五五年冬天，根据党中央和毛主席的指示，我们抓了农业合作化，反对“小脚女人”，根据“全国农业发展纲要”四十条，搞十二年规划，大抓技术改革，又大大地促进了生产的发展。实践经验证明，毛主席所讲的：革命就是解放生产力，革命就是促进生产力的发展，阶级斗争一抓就灵，这是马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。如果说过去我们犯过错误，走过一些弯路，碰过一些钉子，认识不够，还有许多盲目性，现在，就要通过总结我们的实践经验和我们亲身的体会，来认识毛主席教导我们的真理：必须把政治工作摆在第一位，必须用政治来统帅一切。
    怎样用政治来统帅一切工作
    有的同志提出，把政治工作摆在第一位，用政治统帅经济、统帅业务、统帅技术，道理是懂了，但到底怎么做，感到没有办法。提出这个问题不能说没有道理。但是，首要的问题还是要弄清政治统帅一切的道理，是真懂而不是假懂。只要真正懂得了这个道理，具体做法就会在实践当中产生出来。现在我们已经有了不少这方面的好经验。不论军队或地方，都有很多先进单位、先进人物，特别是最近报上介绍了河南兰考县前县委书记焦裕禄同志的事迹，他活学活用毛主席著作，领导群众艰苦奋斗，改变兰考的面貌，为我们作出了光辉的榜样。听说大家学习他的事迹时很感动，对照他来检查自己的思想、作风，感到自己很不够。这很好，要有这种精神。毛主席号召我们全党学解放军，学什么呢？就是要学解放军怎么突出政治，做政治思想工作，活学活用毛主席著作。解放军有无数的先进人物，先进事迹，活的好榜样，我们要学；地方上工业有大庆，农业有大寨，我们也要认真学。怎么学大庆，怎么学大寨，学它的什么？李雪峰同志对我讲过，大寨的经验归纳起来用几句话就可以讲清楚：由于有大寨式的党支部，有大寨式的人（有社会主义觉悟的先进农民），因此才创造了大寨式的先进单位。有的同志在讨论中往往把政治与生产对立起来，好象抓了政治工作，就会放松生产，把政治工作抓好了，生产反而会搞坏。这样看问题是片面的，是形而上学。政治与生产是对立的统一，政治挂帅挂得好，精神就会变物质，生产就会好，而不是相反。我不相信有哪个单位政治思想工作很坏，而集体生产会搞得很好。相反，如果说这个大队的党支部很好，政治思想工作做得很好，干部和社员群众的社会主义觉悟很高，干劲很大，但生产却搞得很坏，我也不相信。你们那个相信有这样的怪事，请拿出一个典型材料来！政治与经济，政治与业务，政治与技术的相互关系到底怎么提法，就农村工作来说，我看是不是可以这样提：高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，以阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争为纲，三大革命一齐抓。在国家统一计划、统一领导下，放手发动群众，发扬大寨精神，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义新农村。这就是以阶级斗争为纲，把阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命一齐抓起来。这样提、这样做行不行？请同志们考虑。
    有些同志争论：到底政治是目的，还是生产是目的？如果说生产是目的，政治是什么？有的同志说，政治是手段，生产是目的，因而政治是为生产服务的。也有的同志说，政治是目的，生产是手段。一般来讲，政治是上层建筑，是为经济基础服务的，同时，政治又是经济的集中表现。如果把它简化成政治是为生产服务的，生产是目的，政治是手段，那就是错误的。“为生产服务”，为的什么“生产”？我们是共产党，共产党有自己的奋斗目标。我们的最终目的是什么呢？是要把我们中华人民共和国建设成为一个强大的社会主义国家，要积极支援世界革命，要打倒帝国主义、打倒一切反动派，实现一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的新世界。我们政治挂帅的目的就是为了这个，经济建设的目的也是为了这个。总而言之，不仅要把我们一国建设好，而且还要支援世界革命，解放全人类，在全世界实现共产主义。这是我们最终的目的。
    有的同志提出人与物的关系。这个问题，我们军队的同志懂得最清楚。毛主席多次讲过这个问题。去年林彪同志发表的一篇重要文章《人民战争胜利万岁》，十分透彻地阐述了毛主席关于革命战争中人的因素第一的道理。我们是小米加步枪，打败了国民党由美国人出武器、出钱、出顾问团指挥的飞机加大炮。我们军队少，装备差，却打败了强大的国民党反动派，什么原因呢？就是因为我们是革命的人民、革命的军队，政治思想第一，人的因素第一，进行的是革命战争，充分发挥了人的主观能动性。越南南方还不是这样？还不是装备差的人民军队、游击队，打败了强大的美帝国主义和南越反动派？古今中外，一切革命战争，无不证实人的因素第一这个普遍真理。当然，打仗也不否定物的因素的作用，如武器、弹药等，但人和物比较起来，人的因素是第一位的。打仗靠人，难道搞社会主义建设不是人的因素第一吗？我们在生产中也并不否定物的因素，没有土地、种子、肥料、耕牛、农具，没有必要的生产资料，怎么能生产呢？但是，要知道，生产力是由劳动者和生产资料构成的。生产力本身是人与物的对立的统一，而人的因素是最生动、最积极的因素。在剥削制度下面，劳动者不仅是剥削者的奴隶，同时是生产资料的奴隶。劳动者的积极性受到了极大的压制或破坏。只有经过社会主义革命，实现了生产资料的公有制，劳动者变成了社会的主人，变成了生产资料的主人，这时劳动者的积极性和创造性才能最大限度地发挥出来。这是马克思列宁主义的一个普遍真理。同志们都知道不少这样的事例：同样的土地、农具、气候条件，可是，生产的结果却往往大不相同。有的皮棉亩产两百多斤，有的只产几十斤，这不是人的因素第一是什么呢？大庆和大寨的客观条件并不好，可是他们成为全国学习的榜样，这不是人的因素第一又是什么呢？为什么我们要强调政治工作，强调做人的思想工作呢？就是为了要教育农民为革命种田，为建设强大的社会主义国家种田，为支援世界革命种田，站在家门口，看到天安门，胸怀祖国，放眼世界。用社会主义思想，用革命到底的思想来教育农民，向资本主义的自发倾向作斗争，这就是我们对农民进行政治思想工作的主要内容。
    干劲怎么鼓法？我们就靠做政治思想工作，再加上关心人民生活，靠这两条来鼓人民的干劲。这两条中那一条更重要呢？提高农民的社会主义觉悟，提高农民为革命种田的觉悟这一条是主要的，应当摆在首位，这就叫政治挂帅。同时必须实行按劳分配、等价交换的原则（在社会主义阶段）。也就是毛主席讲的：把政治工作摆在第一位，还必须实行必要的按劳分配。在这里，我们和修正主义是有原则区别的。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者总是讲物质刺激，讲金钱挂帅，根本不讲革命，不讲政治。如果说讲政治，那也是讲修正主义的政治。其结果是使苏联社会主义经济瓦解，向资本主义倒退。有的同志说，既然讲政治挂帅，好象评工记分、生产队核算、改善人民生活都可以不要了，这是误解，是错误的。我们社会主义发展生产、发展经济，不改善人民生活干什么？生产还有一个目的嘛！人民生活不能改善，社会主义制度的优越性表现在那里呢？集体所有制、全民所有制，使劳动人民变成了生产资料的主人，机器的主人。他们是为自己生产，又是为集体生产，为国家生产，为支援世界革命生产。我们党的方针是要正确处理国家、集体、个人三者之间的关系。这是分配问题，同时也是政治问题。只有正确执行这些政策，才能使人民群众根据自己的切身利益，更加清楚地看到个人利益同社会主义的整体利益、长远利益的一致性，从而更加热爱社会主义祖国，加强爱国主义、国际主义思想；才能调动群众社会主义生产的积极性，才能巩固工农联盟。物质变精神，精神变物质，这是对立的统一，对立面的互相转化。同志们对这个问题千万不可片面理解。
    劲可鼓而不可泄。问题是鼓什么样的干劲。要鼓正确的干劲，不能鼓错误的干劲，要按照党的方针政策去鼓干劲，要善于把革命热情和求实精神结合起来。当然，没有革命热情，满足现状、甘居中游或者落后自满的人，是不可能有求实精神的。焦裕禄同志满腔革命热情地来探求兰考县的实际，看兰考县的“三害”是怎么造成的，通过调查研究，提出正确的措施，领导干部和人民群众向“三害”作斗争，努力改变兰考的面貌。我们象焦裕禄同志这样做，就是政治挂帅、毛泽东思想挂帅；不这样做，就可能是个人主义挂帅。一个党有一个什么挂帅的问题，一个人也有什么挂帅的问题，不是无产阶级思想挂帅，就是资产阶级思想挂帅。我们一个党、一个领导机关、一个人，不受这种思想支配，就要受那种思想支配。这回大家不是也对比了吗？我们湖北有一些比较先进的县、区、公社、大队，也有一批比较落后的县、区、公社、大队。事物有先进、中间、落后这三种状态，这是必然的。但我们要做工作，总要不断地改变它，要使先进的更先进，使中间的向先进看齐，使落后的改变面貌，赶上去。为什么有些地区先进，为什么有些地区老落后？同志们可以总结一下经验教训。我看，是不是政治挂了帅，挂得好不好，搞没搞阶级斗争、两条道路的斗争，是一条主要原因。凡是那些落后的地区，多半是资本主义思想泛滥的地方，再就是缺乏自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，缺乏改天换地的雄心壮志。省委一九五九年提出“大改大增产，小改小增产，不改不增产”的口号，强调改革，方向是正确的。可是后来，我们在有些地方改得不适当，犯了一些错误。所以，一九六○年省委总结经验教训时加了一句：“乱改就减产”。这样就全面了。实践证明：凡是正确地认识了大跃进中的成绩和错误，正确地接受了经验教训，高举总路线的红旗，真正按照这四句话去做的，这几年生产的恢复和发展就很快；凡是不这样搞，怕字当头，稳字当脚，不敢改革，甚至把改得对的也放弃了，良种也不要了，条播也不搞了，水利也不办了，这样的地方就进步很小，或者没有进步，甚至倒退。当然，对落后地区我们省委有责任，帮助不够。我希望同志们不要着急，也不要泄气。要振作起来，好好总结经验教训，要按毛主席指示的，情况明，决心大，方法对，扎扎实实地搞上去。
    省委再三讲，省、地、县各级党委，要把政治思想工作摆在一切工作的首位，要突出政治，狠抓政治思想工作，少抓生产中的具体事情。生产环节，分机器、分化肥，要交给业务部门去搞。我特别强调了，对于那些生产进度、积肥数字等等，希望你们这一辈子都不要感兴趣。有些同志对我这个说法误会了，说：你这一讲，我们县委就不要抓生产了。谁说县委不要抓生产呢？不是说要又红又专，要学点业务，学点科学吗？我们领导农业生产，就要学点农业生产的基本知识。我那样讲，是要我们党委的负责同志多抓一些政治思想工作，少抓一些日常的生产、业务、技术等工作，少搞一些事务主义，而不是说要县委不要抓生产，不领导生产。我们要三大革命一齐抓，县委怎么能不抓生产呢？焦裕禄同志不是抓了生产吗？要象他那样抓生产中的大问题，不是抓小问题。县委书记不要代替“生产队长”。我们的社会主义教育运动，就是要以阶级斗争为纲，又搞生产，又搞科学实验。今后我们办点、蹲点，一律要这样做。
    党委着重抓政治思想工作，抓些什么呢？我看讲多了也抓不了，就是抓党中央和毛主席提出来的五个不可忘记，即：不可忘记阶级斗争，不可忘记无产阶级专政，不可忘记依靠贫农、下中农，不可忘记党的政策，不可忘记党的工作。党委今年抓，明年抓，永远要抓住这五个不可忘记，这就做到政治挂帅了。党委经常抓这五个方面的工作，讨论这五个方面的工作，检查这五个方面的工作。我看只要这五个方面抓好了，就能调动广大干部、广大人民群众的积极性，就能发挥他们的创造性，保险生产一定搞得好。这五个方面抓不好，就是天天讨论生产问题，生产也搞不好。
    具体到下边怎么抓法，过去做得不够好，你们作检讨，我们也要作检讨。今后下去检查工作，发现哪个队生产搞得不好，是落后队，首先就要问生产为什么没有搞好？要向党支部作调查，向贫农、下中农作调查，看看这个地区阶级斗争是什么样子，干部、党员的思想作风是什么样子，贫农、下中农有什么生活问题、思想问题。从这些方面着眼去找生产落后的原因，而不是就生产论生产。首先要从政治上、思想上或者领导是否关心群众生活上去找原因，还要从政策上找原因，看政策上有哪些规定妨碍了群众的积极性。找到原因，加以解决，生产落后的面貌就可以改变。至于说还有没有生产上、技术上的问题？也会有的，一般来讲，这方面的问题是次要的。只要把上面这五个方面的问题解决了，生产、技术落后的问题让干部、群众去讨论，相信群众，依靠群众，这些问题就可以迎刃而解。脱离了干部、贫农、下中农的思想问题，就生产论生产，不抓活思想，不做群众的思想工作，不关心贫农、下中农的生活疾苦，即使是发现了生产技术上的问题，也解决不了。生产技术上同样存在着先进思想与落后思想的斗争，只有通过说服、讨论、试验，把多数干部和群众的思想问题解决了，生产技术上的问题才能够得到解决。
    会议上讨论了“五好”和比学赶帮超的问题。要广泛开展这个运动，搞个开门红，又要红到底！口号是不是可以这样提：“五好为目标，比学赶帮超”。开展这个运动，一帮一，一对红，一面红旗带一片，百面红旗带全县。先进单位对比较落后的单位要帮，你赶我，我帮你，希望你超过我。比什么，学什么，赶什么，帮什么，超什么，都以五好为目标。谁先进，谁落后，都以五好为标准。五好当中政治思想好是第一个条件。不要把增产多少或单产高低，作为第一条。这样搞，就把政治思想工作，把以阶级斗争为纲的三大革命，一齐抓起来了，而不是把它们互相对立起来，把一个一个问题孤立起来。
    关于学习毛主席著作的问题
    中国革命的实践和社会主义建设的实践，以及现在世界革命的实践，已经证明、还将继续证明：毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。在我们党的历史上，凡是毛泽东思想挂帅的时期，革命就得到发展，走向胜利；凡是毛泽东思想没有挂帅的时期，革命就遭受挫折，遭到失败。解放十几年来的历史，同样证明了这个真理。各个地区、各个部门、各项工作，凡是毛泽东思想挂帅好的，工作就好；凡是毛泽东思想挂帅差的，工作就差；凡是不以毛泽东思想挂帅的，就必然走上邪路。所谓政治挂帅，也就是毛泽东思想挂帅。我们要把突出政治、学习毛主席著作、社会主义教育运动、培养革命接班人等联系起来看。这些都是突出政治，政治挂帅。不学习毛主席著作，不用毛泽东思想挂帅，就是空喊政治挂帅，或者是资产阶级的政治挂帅。
    毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义发展的顶峰。毛泽东思想是我们在国内进行一切工作的最高指示，也是我们观察和处理世界革命问题的指南。应当怎样看国内的问题，看世界的问题，认识国际形势？就是要用毛泽东思想作武器来进行分析和判断，不然就不会有正确的认识。现在世界上阶级关系、阶级力量正在大动荡，大分化，大改组；美帝国主义、现代修正主义、反动的民族主义，正在搞反华大合唱。我们要记住毛主席的教导：帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，修正主义是纸老虎，原子弹也是纸老虎。表面强大，张牙舞爪，气势汹汹，实际上非常虚弱，都是垂死的东西。要记住：敌人反对我们、骂我们，是好事，不是坏事。他越骂得凶，越证明我们是正确的、革命的，是真正的马克思列宁主义者。如果修正主义分子不骂我们，奉承我们，叫我们的好，那我们就同他们差不多，成为修正主义或者半修正主义了。帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，只占世界人口的百分之几，他们越骂我们，就越暴露他们自己。他们的人民会想一想，为什么要骂中国，中国是好是坏？可以提高人民的觉悟。现在美帝国主义把全球战略的重点从欧洲转移到亚洲，矛头对准我们。好，这就证明我们是真正的马克思列宁主义者。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不革命了，而且反对别人革命，做美帝国主义的帮凶，一心想搞苏美合作主宰世界。我看这也是做梦。帝国主义内部还有矛盾，它同现代修正主义就能合作得好？毛主席一再教导我们，不管天下发生什么乱子，都不要惊慌。要相信人民。世界上百分之九十以上的人民是要革命的，他们有的已经起来斗争，有的迟早要起来斗争。一切帝国主义和反动派迟早要灭亡，他们的寿命是不会很长的。毛主席的英明论断，过去是对的，现在是对的，客观形势的发展，还将再三证明是对的。当然，世界革命也和我们中国革命一样，不可能是一帆风顺的，会遭到一些挫折，甚至严重的挫折。但是，最后总是要胜利的。这是谁也改变不了的社会发展规律。不坚定地相信这个真理，就不是历史唯物主义者，就不是马克思列宁主义者。
    学习毛主席著作，怎么学？怎么用？就是林彪同志讲的，带着问题学，活学活用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。有些同志讲，不知道带什么问题学，学了也不会用。我个人是不是就会了呢？不能这样讲。是不是完全不会？也不是。究竟带着什么问题学？学了怎么用？用它干什么？根据我个人的见解，归纳起来，是要带着两方面的问题学，在两方面用。即：带着思想上的问题学，带着工作中的问题学；用来改造思想，用来改进工作。改造思想，不仅是改造别人的思想，而且首要的是要改造我们自己的思想。我们每个人毫无例外地要用毛泽东思想来改造自己的思想。“打铁先要本身硬”。光改造别人的思想，不首先改造自己的思想，对别人是马列主义，对自己是自由主义，那样的思想工作是没有用的。我们的脑子里经常存在着各种各样的错误思想。毛主席教导我们：人要每天洗脸、扫地、打扫灰尘。改造思想是一辈子的事情。帝国主义分子诬蔑我们改造思想是“洗脑筋”。洗脑筋有什么不好？思想上有脏东西，就要把它洗掉，把各种非无产阶级思想洗掉。坏思想不去，好思想不来，这也是对立的统一，不破不立。
    改造思想，改什么？就是毛主席讲的用无产阶级的世界观和方法论，来改造资产阶级的世界观和方法论。当然，方法论也是世界观，分开讲，也可以，实际上是分不开的。要教育我们所有的干部、党员，一心为革命，一心为人民，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死。这就是全心全意为人民的精神、无产阶级彻底革命的精神，这就是共产主义思想，也就是我们共产党员、革命干部应该具备的共产主义世界观，或者叫宇宙观。世界观问题是根本问题，是立场、观点问题。每个同志都要懂得，在整个社会主义革命和社会主义建设的历史时期，我们都要兴无灭资，要经常注意在我们自己的头脑中兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，也要帮助别的同志兴无产阶级思想，灭资产阶级思想，不能让这两种思想“和平共处”。毛主席讲，没有党内斗争，我们党的生命就会完结。一个人的思想没有斗争，就等于思想停止了，死亡了。不前进就会后退，不是逐步走向彻底无产阶级化，就会不知不觉地和平演变成资产阶级化。“学如逆水行舟，不进则退。”人的思想变化就是如此。
    什么叫兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想？所谓无产阶级思想，就是集体主义、爱国主义、国际主义、共产主义。与无产阶级思想对立的是个人主义、本位主义、地方主义、民族主义或大国沙文主义，这都是资产阶级的思想。无产阶级思想的核心是共产主义，资产阶级思想的核心是个人主义。本位主义、地方主义、民族主义，无非是放大了的个人主义。在这些方面，我们都要兴无灭资。如果没有无产阶级的立场，想解决方法论的问题是解决不了的。当然，这并不是说有了无产阶级的立场，方法论的问题就不重要了，或者方法论的问题就自然而然地解决了。在实际工作中，好心办坏事的错误，就是方法论的问题；动机好，方法不对，还是达不到目的。毛主席强调提倡唯物辩证法，反对形而上学和烦琐哲学，就是鉴于我们党内有些同志思想方法是形而上学的。形而上学多了，辩证法少了，我们的工作方法就会出现烦琐哲学。一个案子写多少万字的材料，统计表报搞那么多。有的同志提出“会议多、文件多、表报多”。我们接受批评，我们省委要改，你们也要顶，不该填的表报一律不填。有的人不发表格，发调查提纲，结果比统计表还复杂，你们也不填就是了。对于“五多”，要采取各种办法抵制。
    要解决思想方法和工作方法问题，就要学习毛主席的四篇哲学著作，特别要学好《矛盾论》。不是提倡唯物辩证法吗？《矛盾论》是写辩证法写得最好、最全面、最系统的一篇文章。真正把《矛盾论》读通了，就真懂了辩证法；多懂一些《矛盾论》，就多懂得一些辩证法；不懂《矛盾论》，就不懂辩证法。
    关于工作方法问题，我提议同志们很好地学习《关心群众生活，注意工作方法》、《关于领导方法的若干问题》和《党委会的工作方法》等三篇文章。毛主席关于民主集中制问题的论述，也要好好学习。特别是省、地、县三级党委，要通过学习，检查工作，改进领导，一定要有具体措施，要有实效。民主集中制是我们党的根本原则，也是各级党委的根本工作方法。
    总之，要带着思想和工作中的问题学习毛主席著作，要用无产阶级的世界观和方法论，去反对资产阶级的世界观和方法论。学习毛主席著作，必须学习毛主席的立场、观点、方法，在改造客观世界的过程中不断地改造我们的主观世界。
    带着工作中的问题学，怎么学？举个例子来讲。
    毛主席一再强调两点论、两分法、一分为二。毛主席这样教导我们，同志们看事看人是否都学会了两分法？讲成绩就忘掉缺点、错误，讲到缺点、错误又看不到成绩；讲到困难看不到光明，讲到光明又看不到困难，这就不是两分法，而是形而上学。我们过去犯过这种认识上的错误，今后也还会犯这样或那样的错误，犯了就要马上纠正。难道这也很难吗？贫农、下中农对农村工作中的许多问题，都会用两分法来分析，政治水平相当高。相反，我们有些工作人员，同贫农、下中农比起来，政治水平却不如他们，对问题看不清楚，又自以为是，不肯听取群众意见。这就不能不犯错误，碰钉子。
    因此我们要提高自觉性，努力学会用两分法去看人看事，力求减少盲目性、片面性。在这方面，我们要向工农兵学习。无疑，我们党、我们的领导干部，有责任向工农兵进行教育，向他们作政治思想工作。而为了做他们的工作，首先就要向他们学习。现在广大工农兵群众都在学毛主席著作，有些积极分子学得很好，用得很好，写的文章也很好，那是我们许多知识分子写不出来的。毛主席再三教导我们，不要迷信教授，不要迷信伟人、作家、哲学家，有些所谓出名的“哲学家”，往往不懂哲学，是假哲学家。毛主席提倡哲学要走出课堂，走出书斋。毛主席讲，真理在谁手里，我们就跟谁走，挑大粪的有真理，我们就跟挑大粪的走。北京市的掏粪工人时传祥同志，不就是我们学习的一个榜样吗！我们要老老实实向工农兵学习。我参观过部队廖初江、丰福生、黄祖示学毛主席著作、用毛主席著作的展览会，受到了教育。工农兵学毛主席著作，用毛主席著作来改造思想、改造世界，这是一个伟大的兴无灭资的革命运动。这个运动是多快好省地建设一个强大的社会主义新中国的巨大动力！
    有的同志讲，文化低，学不到，用不到。这不是理由。不识字也可以学，可以听别人读，不懂就问别人。既学毛主席著作，又学文化。有的同志讲，学习毛主席著作同自己的工作和思想联系不起来。那要看你是不是真正下了功夫。只要下决心，有高度的革命热情，有高度的阶级感情，去学习毛主席著作，没有哪个人学不到、用不到。只能说有人学得快点、多点，用得好点。有人学得慢点、少点，用得差点。这样的差别是有的。根本学不到、用不到的事是没有的，除非是懒汉，根本不想学，那就没法了。我曾经看过一个中学生的一封信。她说：思想上的问题和学习上的问题，没有在毛主席著作中找不到解答的。这是一个中学生说的话，我认为是真理。中国乒乓球队用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，赢得世界冠军。《毛泽东选集》一至四卷有一篇讲如何打乒乓球的文章吗？没有。可是徐寅生同志却从毛主席著作中找到了武器，写了一篇怎样打乒乓球的好文章。徐寅生同志二十多岁，我们在座的同志大都在三十岁以上，有的四十、五十了，再不学就要落后了。所以，同志们为了革命，要用满腔热情学毛主席著作，带着问题学，学了就用，在“用”字上狠下功夫。要真正把毛泽东思想学到手，要付出艰巨的劳动。要做到老学到老。要革命到底，就要学毛主席著作到底。我们每个同志要当毛主席的好学生，好战士，好宣传员。这是我们的义务。不论工农兵、干部、革命知识分子，都是革命战士。为革命工作，为革命奋斗一生，要立场坚定，一心为革命，一心为人民，不为名，不为利，不怕苦，不怕死。要当好毛泽东思想的宣传员，处处以身作则，宣传毛泽东思想。开会、谈话、在家里、在外面、和贫农、下中农谈心，都要宣传毛泽东思想。要象雷锋、王杰那样，不仅用嘴巴宣传，而且要用行动来宣传。身教重于言教。同志们！我们要求你们这样做，也希望你们监督我们这样做。如果我们哪些做得不够，做得不对，就请你们批评。
    工作方法问题
    我们今年向大家介绍过孝感县委八个字的工作方法。他们的八个字是“值班、蹲点、劳动、学习”。值班，就是说，县、区、公社直到大队支部、贫协、大队长、副大队长，各级党政机关的主要领导成员轮流值班，负责处理日常工作。不值班的，就下去蹲点。蹲点要参加劳动，不仅仅是为劳动而劳动，而是要通过参加劳动，进行群众工作，进行科学试验，与工农群众打成一片，与他们同命运，共呼吸。学习，在家值班要学习，蹲点的带着毛主席著作下去，一样要学习，还要参加群众学习，领导群众学习。后来，我们又在这八个字上帮他们加了两个字：民主，成为十个字。民主，就是说办一切事都要发扬民主，先民主，再集中。下去蹲点，不要站在群众头上指手划脚，要同群众商量办事。哪些事要办，哪些事不办，哪些事先办，哪些事后办，都要同群众商量，同贫农、下中农、基层干部商量。要真正地商量，先听群众的意见，再发表自己的看法，群众有不同的意见，要反复酝酿，不能把自己的意见强加于人。不能一去就当先生。党委会一定要执行民主集中制，不准一个人说了算。书记和委员的关系，是平等的关系，不是上下级的关系。以上十个字——“值班、蹲点、劳动、学习、民主”，建议各县也都照着办，大家看行不行？
    有的同志提出，从实际出发有时候与执行上级指示有矛盾，怎么办？办法：第一是可以暂缓执行，第二是立即向上级报告。至于有些小事，例如什么时候下秧、什么时候积肥等，上面本来不该管的，却硬要管，出的主意又与下面实际情况不符合，下面可以不执行，也不必报告。这不算无组织无纪律。方针政策方面的问题，要向上面报告，一直可以报到省，报到中央。同志们，民主是个大问题，没有民主，一个人说了算，那还有什么群众路线？我们工作中犯错误，除了没有认真领会和坚决执行毛主席的指示之外，我认为主要的还在于两条：一条是没有蹲点，再一条就是民主不够。如果有这两条，就可以少犯一些错误，犯了错误，也可以发现和纠正得更早、更快一些。蹲点和民主搞得好一些，了解实际情况多一些，就可以比较容易理解毛主席的思想。林彪同志提倡吃透两头，看来不吃透“下头”，就难以吃透“上头”，反之，亦然。毛主席站得高，看得远，我们不经过实践，不碰钉子，往往不能真正领会毛主席的思想。现在我们照上面的十个字办，努力做到“吃透两头”，我们的工作就可以做得更好一些。
    工作方法的另一个大问题，是县委怎样更好地实行集体领导下的分工负责制。县委的具体事可多了，那么多的部门都要来找，要处理日常工作，还要蹲点，还要劳动、学习……。如果一个县委书记不能比较闲一点，有一点时间看书，作调查研究，同下面干部和贫农、下中农谈心，想问题，就是辛苦忙碌到浑身是病，工作也还是搞不好的。唯一的办法，就是进一步改进县委集体领导下的分工负责制。可以分几条战线，在县委统一领导下，分头负责。该分给业务部门办的事，就交给业务部门负责去办。县委领导干部，轮流值班。县委书记管总的，除了主持县委会议、抓学习以外，就是下乡蹲点，还可以抽时间跑一跑面，不要老在家里坐办公室。你们看这样办行不行？
    “这一边不放心，那一边害怕。”县委书记自己不直接抓生产业务，让别人抓，总不放心；分工管生产的同志也有点怕，怕抓不好。我看，你当书记的也不要不放心，负责管生产的同志也不要害怕。只要执行党的方针政策，依靠群众，就不会把事情办坏。就是出点毛病，也不要怕。同志们要懂得，具体事情错一百件，无伤大体，大政方针（例如思想政治工作或生产上的重大措施）只要错一件，就会全盘被动。不抓大政方针，天天打杂、催耕、催种、催收、催交，结果工作还是搞不好啊。再者，具体事情的处理，并不是件件都能联系到重大原则上面去的。有些具体事可以这样处理，也可以那样处理，分工负责的同志就要大胆负责。处理错了，改过来就行。我们对各部门的同志讲过，大事情要请示报告，日常事情你们大胆处理，办错了，省委替你们担担子。
    总之，要搞好党委集体领导下的分工负责制，必须实行毛主席说的八句话：“大权独揽，小权分散。党委决定，各方去办。办也有决，不离原则。工作检查，党委有责。”按照这八句话去办，问题就可以得到解决。
    今天我讲的没有哪一个是新鲜问题，用湖北人的说法就是“炒现饭”。现饭也不坏，加点油、盐一炒，蛮好吃嘛！阶级斗争要年年讲，月月讲，天天讲。政治挂帅，学习毛主席著作，也要年年讲，月月讲，天天讲。不过我加的油、盐不多，现饭不一定炒得好吃，好在会议还有几天，有什么意见，大家还是敞开思想谈。不要因为我讲了，你们就不讲了。还要讲，特别是要批评省委领导的缺点、错误。我讲得不对，你们就批评，我就改正。　（原载《红旗》杂志一九六六年第五期）
