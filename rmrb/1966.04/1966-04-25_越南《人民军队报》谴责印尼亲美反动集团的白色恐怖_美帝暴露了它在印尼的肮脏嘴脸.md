    The Vietnamese "People's Army Daily" Condemns the White Terror of the Pro-American Reactionary Clique in Indonesia
    American Imperialism Exposes Its Ugly Face in Indonesia
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 22nd (Telegraph) The Vietnamese "People's Army Daily" published a commentary on the 22nd, pointing out that the pro-American reactionary clique in Indonesia is going further and further down the path of sin. It is trying its best to make Indonesia subordinate to American imperialism.
    The commentary said that the pro-American reactionary clique in Indonesia is intensifying the white terror domestically, continuing large-scale arrests and bloody massacres, attempting to eliminate patriotic progressive forces and communists. All progressive parties and political organizations established by Indonesian revolutionary forces have been persecuted, dissolved, or banned. However, those pro-American reactionary organizations that had been banned by President Sukarno for engaging in activities that harmed the country and the people are now vigorously active again.
    The commentary said that in terms of foreign policy, Indonesia's new Foreign Minister Malik has openly declared "efforts to improve relations with the United States" and studying Indonesia "returning to" the American-controlled "United Nations." Recently, it has begged the United States and Japan for "aid." It holds a hostile attitude towards forces in the world that oppose imperialism.
    The commentary said that what is especially serious is that the pro-American reactionary clique in Indonesia is increasingly harboring a despicable hostile attitude towards the People's Republic of China. It closed the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch, closed the Indonesian Chinese schools, plundered the property of many overseas Chinese organizations, and sent armed thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, looting and destroying the embassy's property, injuring embassy staff, and even brazenly occupying the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta.
    The commentary said that American imperialism is increasingly clearly exposing its ugly face in the Indonesian issue. The Washington authorities are constantly planning activities for the Indonesian American puppet clique through propaganda machines.
    The US Ambassador to Jakarta has repeatedly met with Indonesian reactionary leaders to plot unspeakable conspiracies for them. American journalists who were previously expelled from Indonesia have now been invited back to work.
    The commentary pointed out that in the face of the frantic sabotage and suppression by the United States and its running dogs, the indomitable Indonesian people are still struggling in various forms. The progressive forces and people of the world firmly support the Indonesian revolutionary people in their struggle against American imperialism and the pro-American reactionary clique.

    越南《人民军队报》谴责印尼亲美反动集团的白色恐怖
    美帝暴露了它在印尼的肮脏嘴脸
    新华社河内二十二日电　越南《人民军队报》二十二日发表评论指出，印度尼西亚亲美反动集团正在罪恶的道路上越走越远。它竭力使印度尼西亚附属于美帝国主义。
    评论说，印度尼西亚亲美反动集团在国内加强白色恐怖，继续进行大逮捕和血腥的大屠杀，妄图消灭爱国进步力量和共产党人。由印度尼西亚革命力量建立的所有进步党派和政治组织，都遭到了迫害、解散或禁止活动。而那些进行祸国殃民活动而被苏加诺总统下令禁止了的亲美反动组织，却又大肆活动起来了。
    评论说，在对外政策方面，印度尼西亚的新外长马利克，公然宣称“设法改善同美国的关系”和研究印度尼西亚“重新回到”由美国操纵的“联合国的问题”。最近，它已经向美国和日本乞求“援助”。它对于世界上反对帝国主义的力量，则抱着敌视态度。
    评论说，尤其严重的是，印度尼西亚亲美反动集团日益对中华人民共和国抱着卑鄙的敌视态度。它封闭了新华社驻雅加达分社，封闭了印度尼西亚华侨学校，掠夺了许多华侨团体的财产，并且派遣武装暴徒袭击了中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆，抢劫和破坏了大使馆的财产，打伤了使馆的工作人员，甚至悍然占领中国驻雅加达总领事馆。
    评论说，美帝国主义日益清楚地暴露了它在印度尼西亚问题上的肮脏嘴脸。华盛顿当局通过宣传机器，不断为印度尼西亚美国走狗集团策划活动。
    美国驻雅加达大使接连同印度尼西亚反动头目会晤，为他们策划不可告人的阴谋。过去被驱逐出印度尼西亚的美国记者现在又被邀请回来活动。
    评论指出，面对着美国及其走狗的疯狂破坏和镇压行动，坚强不屈的印度尼西亚人民仍然以各种形式进行斗争。全世界进步力量和人民坚决支持印度尼西亚革命人民反对美帝国主义和亲美反动集团。
