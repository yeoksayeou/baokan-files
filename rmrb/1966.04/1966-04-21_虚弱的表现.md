	The Indonesian government, while organizing armed personnel and fascist thugs to attack the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta and injure personnel of our embassy, has its Foreign Minister Malik come out and say that the Indonesian government is "willing" to "maintain good relations" with China. Committing arson and assault is actually described as "good" intentions, truly there are no wonders under the heavens!
	How can the government of a country be so brazen and shameless? It is clearly deliberately creating incidents, using every possible means to undermine normal relations between Indonesia and China, yet it still talks a lot about its "good" intentions towards China. If this were really the case, then justice and evil, kindness and tyranny, truth and falsehood... all these concepts would need to be reversed. And the Chinese people should not only not protest the anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces, but should express gratitude to them!
	Just as Malik was earnestly professing the Indonesian government's "good" intentions towards China, the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta was again attacked, destroyed, and occupied by thugs organized by the right wing. According to Malik's statement, wouldn't this be a further step in the "good" relations between the Indonesian government and China?
	The Chinese people cannot help but express strong indignation at the Indonesian government's intensified anti-China and anti-Chinese criminal activities! There is a saying in China: "A real man does what he does and takes responsibility for it." Since the Indonesian government is willing to act as a pawn of U.S. imperialism in opposing China, it should have the courage to bear the blame for breaking off relations between Indonesia and China. Malik's feigned ignorance only proves the weakness of the Indonesian reactionaries.

### 虚弱的表现

    虚弱的表现
    印度尼西亚政府，一面组织武装人员和法西斯暴徒袭击中国驻雅加达大使馆，枪伤我使馆人员；一面却由它的外交部长马利克出来说，印度尼西亚政府“愿意”同中国“保持良好关系”。放火行凶，竟被说成是“良好”的意图，真可谓天下之大，无奇不有！
    一个国家的政府，怎么能够这样厚颜无耻呢？明明是蓄意制造事端，无所不用其极地破坏印度尼西亚同中国的正常关系，却还要大谈其对中国的什么“良好”意愿。如果真是这样的话，那么，正义和邪恶，善良和暴虐，真实和虚伪……所有这些概念，都需要颠倒过来才行。而中国人民对印度尼西亚右派反动势力的反华、排华暴行，不仅不该提任何抗议，却应该向他们表示感谢了！
    就在马利克信誓旦旦地表白印度尼西亚政府对中国“良好”意愿的时候，中国驻雅加达的总领事馆又被右派组织的暴徒袭击、破坏和强占。按照马利克的说法，这岂不是印度尼西亚政府同中国的“良好”关系又进了一步吗？
    中国人民对印度尼西亚政府变本加厉地进行反华、排华的罪恶活动，不能不表示强烈的愤慨！中国有句俗语：“好汉做事好汉当”。印度尼西亚政府既然甘心充当美帝国主义的反华走卒，那就应该有勇气承担破裂印度尼西亚同中国关系的罪责。马利克的装聋卖傻，只能证明印度尼西亚反动派的虚弱而已。
