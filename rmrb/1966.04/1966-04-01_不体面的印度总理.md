    The Indecent Indian Prime Minister
    By Our Correspondent
    The Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, visited Washington and issued a joint communique with Johnson, slandering China for "aggression" and claiming that China posed a "threat to peace, particularly peace in Asia." This Indian Prime Minister even delivered an anti-China speech in Washington, slandering China for "not wanting peace in the Indian subcontinent," and so on.
    The Indian reactionaries have been opposing China for many years. Nehru opposed it as long as he could, Shastri continued to oppose it; after Shastri opposed it, now the new Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, has taken over. This is called a continuation of the same line, which is not surprising. Moreover, after all this opposition, it is still some old tunes that have long been bankrupt, nothing more than China's "aggression" and China's unwillingness for "peace." The whole world is already tired of hearing these anti-China clichés.
    Who exactly is carrying out aggression in Asia, and who is undermining peace in Asia? The facts are all there for everyone to see. The culprit threatening the security of Asian countries and undermining peace in Asia is U.S. imperialism. It launched the Korean War and still occupies China's territory, Taiwan Province. Currently, it has sent more than 200,000 expeditionary troops to launch a large-scale war of aggression against the people of South Vietnam. Besides U.S. imperialism, there are also Indian expansionists. Isn't it the Indian reactionaries who launched an armed attack on their neighbor Pakistan, thereby undermining peace on the subcontinent for a time? Isn't it the Indian reactionaries who are constantly creating military conflicts on the Sino-Indian border? China opposes both U.S. imperialist aggression and the aggression of Indian expansionists. China opposes all aggression and firmly supports the anti-aggression struggle of the people of all countries. This is China's position. U.S. imperialism and the Indian reactionaries are trying to attribute their own crimes of aggression and undermining peace in Asia to China, which is impossible.
    Perhaps Mrs. Gandhi has also discovered that the anti-China clichés of her predecessors are difficult to find a market for. Therefore, she is trying to create new arguments with a new twist. She told the American audience that the "conflict" between China and India was due to India's "efforts in developing democratic socialism" and as "an example of a powerful and prosperous democratic country." This is truly an unprecedented discovery: it turns out that China is jealous of India's "prosperity" and "democracy"!
    Since the Indian Prime Minister herself has raised the issue of India's internal affairs, we cannot help but say a few words. The Chinese people certainly respect the diligence and intelligence of the Indian people, but we are not at all interested in the so-called "prosperity" and "democracy" of today's India that Mrs. Gandhi boasts about. Is it the kind of "prosperity" where hundreds of millions of people are starving and millions die of hunger? Is it the kind of "democracy" that arbitrarily arrests citizens in the name of the fascist decree of the so-called "Defense of India Act" and carries out bloody suppression of the people who participate in anti-hunger marches and demonstrations? Sorry, these things also existed in old China under the rule of imperialism and reactionaries. As early as sixteen years ago, we swept them away as garbage.
    Originally, everyone knew that the new Indian Prime Minister was visiting the United States this time because of the serious deterioration of the food crisis and the increasing bankruptcy of the economy in India. According to the "Indian News Service" on March 24, one of the themes of the US-India talks was the unprecedented food crisis in India since its independence. The Indian Prime Minister is certainly free to go to the United States to beg for bread. The Chinese people are not willing to interfere with this. However, why does the Indian Prime Minister have to vehemently oppose China while begging for bread in Washington? Obviously, the Indian Prime Minister is using anti-China as a means of pleasing U.S. imperialism, with the aim of seeking more alms from the big bosses of Wall Street.
    The Indian Prime Minister is acting too indecently!

    不体面的印度总理
    本报评论员
    印度总理甘地夫人到华盛顿去访问，同约翰逊发表了一个联合公报，诬蔑中国
  “侵略”，说什么中国造成了“对和平，特别是亚洲和平的威胁”。这位印度总理，还在华盛顿专门发表反华演说，诬蔑中国
  “不希望印度次大陆有和平”，等等。
    印度反动派反华，已经反了好多年了。尼赫鲁反不下去了，夏斯特里接着反；夏斯特里反过了，现在印度的新总理甘地夫人又接上来了。这叫一脉相承，是毫不奇怪的。而且反来反去，也还是一些早就破了产的老调，无非是中国“侵略”，中国不要“和平”。对于这些反华滥调，全世界早已听厌了。
    究竟是谁在亚洲进行侵略，谁在破坏亚洲的和平？事实俱在，有目共睹。威胁亚洲各国安全、破坏亚洲和平的罪魁，是美帝国主义。它发动过侵朝战争，至今还霸占着中国的领土台湾省。目前，它派遣了二十多万远征军，正在对南越人民发动一场大规模的侵略战争。除了美帝国主义，还有印度扩张主义者。难道不正是印度反动派向它的邻国巴基斯坦发动了武装进攻，从而使次大陆的和平一度遭到了破坏吗？难道不正是印度反动派不断地在中印边境制造军事冲突吗？中国既反对美帝国主义侵略，也反对印度扩张主义者的侵略。中国反对一切侵略，坚定不移地支持各国人民的反侵略斗争。这就是中国的立场。美帝国主义和印度反动派企图把他们自己在亚洲干的侵略和破坏和平的罪恶勾当说成是中国干的，这是办不到的。
    大概甘地夫人也发现，她的前任的那些反华滥调，已经难以找到市场了。于是，她力图花样翻新，创造一些新的论据。她向美国听众说，中国和印度“冲突”，是由于印度“在发展民主社会主义方面所作出的努力”和作为“一个堪为强大繁荣民主国家的范例”。这真是个闻所未闻的新发现：原来中国是在嫉忌印度的“繁荣”和“民主”呵！
    既然印度总理自己提出了关于印度的内政问题，我们不能不奉陪几句。中国人民固然十分尊敬印度人民的勤劳和才智，但是，我们对于甘地夫人所吹嘘的今日印度的所谓“繁荣”和“民主”，却丝毫也没有兴趣。是那种成亿人民嗷嗷待哺，成百万人死于饥饿的“繁荣”吗？是那种在所谓“保卫印度法”的法西斯法令的名义下任意逮捕公民和对参加反饥饿游行示威的人民群众进行血腥镇压的“民主”吗？对不起，这些东西，在帝国主义和反动派统治下的旧中国也是有的，早在十六年前，我们把它们当作垃圾，一扫而光。
    本来，谁都知道，印度新总理这一次是在印度国内粮食危机严重恶化和经济日益破产的情况下到美国去访问的。据“印度新闻处”三月二十四日说，美印双方会谈的主题之一，是印度独立以来空前未有的粮食危机。印度总理当然有自由到美国去乞讨面包。对此，中国人民并不愿意过问。但是，印度总理为什么要在向华盛顿乞求面包的同时，非要大反一通中国不可呢？显然，印度总理是拿反华作为讨好美帝国主义的一种手段，目的是求得华尔街大老板多施舍一些罢了。
    印度总理做得未免太不体面了！
