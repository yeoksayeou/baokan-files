    The State Economic Commission and the Industrial and Transportation Political Department of the CPC Central Committee recently jointly convened a National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and a National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference. Starting from summarizing experiences, this conference conducted in-depth inspections and debates on how to highlight politics in enterprises. Through inspection and debate, thoughts were unified, and understanding was enhanced. To further highlight politics in enterprises, we must further run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought; this is the conclusion of the conference.
    Currently, the industrial and transportation front in our country, like other fronts nationwide, is in excellent shape. The class consciousness of the broad masses of workers has been raised to an unprecedented level, the overall outlook of industrial production has changed somewhat, and technological innovation and the technological revolution have greatly developed. This is the inevitable result of three years of great development, three years of adjustment, and two years of new upsurges in production, and it is also the inevitable result of gradually and consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to run enterprises. However, we must make a calm analysis of this excellent situation. We have only begun to have some of our own experiences; we have only begun to change the face of poverty and blankness; enterprise management has not yet formed a complete system, and only a portion of cadres understand how to run enterprises using Mao Zedong Thought. Compared to our great goal of catching up with and surpassing the world's advanced levels, compared to our great ideal of building communism, our existing achievements should only make us feel very insufficient and should not lead to any complacency.
    The general line of our Party for socialist construction was formulated based on the initiative of Comrade Mao Zedong. To run enterprises according to the spirit of the general line is to run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought. After eight years of great practice, we have gained rich experience in self-reliance, hard work, and the thorough implementation of the general line, and we have formulated a complete set of guidelines, policies, and methods for implementing the general line. At the same time, Daqing and a large number of Daqing-style advanced units embodying the spirit of the general line have emerged. This powerfully proves that the path of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought is the only correct path for our country's industrialization.
    What are the basic points of running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought?
    To run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, we must take class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, consolidate and develop socialism, avoid revisionism, prevent capitalist restoration, and ensure a gradual transition to communism.
    The class struggle in enterprises often manifests as the struggle between proletarian and bourgeois ideologies, and as the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. For example, should the production technology, business management, and rules and regulations of enterprises follow our own path, or should they be copied from the capitalist and revisionist systems? Should we establish the idea of wholeheartedly serving users, that is, serving the people, or should we maintain a purely task-oriented and purely profit-oriented view? Should we work hard and adhere to the principle of diligence and frugality in running enterprises, or should we seek comfort and abandon the principle of diligence and frugality? Should we cultivate collectivist spirit and communist style, or should we encourage bourgeois ideology? Should we gradually reduce the differences between urban and rural areas, workers and peasants, and mental and manual labor, or should we maintain and expand these three differences? All of these are major issues related to whether enterprises are gradually advancing toward communism or gradually regressing toward capitalism. We must grasp class struggle as the key link and adhere to the socialist direction of enterprises.
    To adhere to the socialist direction and prevent capitalist restoration, the key is to establish a highly proletarianized and highly combative industrial army in enterprises. And to build such an industrial army, we must go through a serious class struggle to promote the proletariat and eliminate the bourgeoisie. The view that our enterprises have only a single working class and no serious class struggle violates both the principles of Marxism-Leninism and the reality of socialist enterprises. On the one hand, socialist enterprises are part of socialism, and enterprises maintain close ties with society. The class struggle that exists in society is bound to be reflected within enterprises, within the working class, and even within the Party organizations of enterprises. On the other hand, only a portion of the employees in our enterprises are hereditary workers, and more are former peasants, urban petty bourgeoisie, and various intellectuals. To proletarianize these employees of non-proletarian origin, it is impossible without class struggle in the ideological field. At the same time, there are also bourgeois elements and elements of other exploiting classes in enterprises. To transform them and proletarianize them, it is unimaginable without serious class struggle in politics and ideology. What we usually call doing the work of people is essentially the work of conducting class education on people, aiming at various living thoughts, and using proletarian ideology to overcome non-proletarian ideology.
    Class struggle is often linked to the struggle for production and scientific experiments, and the largest number of class struggle phenomena in enterprises are often expressed through the struggle for production and scientific experiments. We emphasize grasping the three great revolutionary movements together, which is to promote the struggle for production and scientific experiments with class struggle, to analyze and deal with various problems in the struggle for production and scientific experiments with the viewpoint of class struggle, and to carry out political and ideological work in the struggle for production and scientific experiments. In this way, we unite the transformation of the objective world with the transformation of people's subjective world, we unite the socialist revolution and socialist construction in enterprises, and we unite the three major tasks of enterprises: producing products, producing talents, and producing experiences. In this way, the more the production of the enterprise develops, the more revolutionary the enterprise's workforce becomes. In this way, while developing production, the enterprise not only prepares material conditions for future communism but also prepares spiritual conditions for future communism. Grasping the class struggle and the struggle between the two roads in enterprises is the key to building a proletarian industrial army in enterprises, the key to fundamentally ensuring that enterprises develop production along the socialist direction, and the key to fundamentally preventing capitalist restoration and the emergence of revisionism.
    To run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, we must thoroughly follow the mass line and vigorously carry out mass movements.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "We have always advocated that revolution should rely on the masses of the people, with everyone taking action, and opposed relying only on a few people to issue orders."
    Socialist enterprises are not only engaged in socialist construction but also in socialist revolution. Moreover, the struggle for production and scientific experiments in socialist construction are also great revolutionary movements. Therefore, to run socialist enterprises, we must, according to the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong, rely on the masses of the people and have everyone take action, rather than relying only on a few people to issue orders. This requires us to implement the Party's fundamental line—the mass line—in the three great revolutionary movements of enterprises. This is a fundamental sign distinguishing socialist enterprises from capitalist enterprises, and it is also a fundamental sign distinguishing our socialist enterprises from revisionist enterprises.
    The development of production in enterprises must rely on the broad masses, and the development of technology in enterprises must also rely on the broad masses. Some people still lack awareness of this, or still lack a deep understanding. The working class of our country is not only the master of the country, not only the master of production, but also should fully become the master of science and technology. Their rich practical experience and skilled operating techniques give them full say on technical issues in enterprise production. Countless facts prove that whether we can rely on the broad masses in science and technology is a major issue for whether science and technology can develop in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war is the concrete application of the Party's mass line in war. To implement the mass line in developing science and technology in enterprises, we should also apply Comrade Mao Zedong's thought on people's war. To speed up the "annihilation" of the "enemy" in science and technology in our enterprises, it is not enough to rely solely on technical personnel as "regular troops." We must also rely on the broad masses of workers as "local armed forces" and "militia." This is what we advocate: the three-in-one combination of leading cadres, technical personnel, and worker masses. Truly implementing the three-in-one combination means truly implementing the thought of people's war in production technology, and it also means truly implementing the mass line in production technology. In an enterprise, if we only vigorously carry out mass movements in class struggle and the struggle for production but do not simultaneously vigorously carry out mass movements in scientific experiments, it can only be considered a half-baked mass line, not a thorough mass line.
    Our socialist enterprises, after more than ten years of practice, have gained rich experience in thoroughly following the mass line and vigorously carrying out mass movements, and they have begun to have some systems for thoroughly following the mass line and vigorously carrying out mass movements. The "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is a fundamental system. The "two participations" are: cadres participate in labor alongside workers in the posture of ordinary laborers, and workers participate in management alongside cadres in the capacity of masters of the country. The "one reform" is to reform the enterprise's rules and regulations based on the actual situation of the enterprise's production development and based on the practical experience of the broad masses of employees, so that the enterprise's rules and regulations are more conducive to mobilizing the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of employees, and more conducive to the development of enterprise production. The "three combinations" is to adopt a form of combining leading cadres, technical personnel, and worker masses when solving technical problems in enterprise production. The system of "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" is a system for implementing the mass line in running enterprises, and it is a system conducive to vigorously carrying out mass movements. Seriously implementing this system ensures that mass movements can be vigorously carried out in enterprises.
    To vigorously carry out mass movements, we must eliminate misunderstandings about mass movements. Some people, upon hearing the term mass movement, think only of holding large meetings and making a lot of noise. This approach is not actually carrying out mass movements but is engaging in formalism. As a result, it not only fails to truly mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses but also harms the enthusiasm of the broad masses. True mass movements should be the conscious actions of the broad masses under the leadership of the Party, which requires the Party organizations of enterprises to do in-depth ideological education work for the broad masses, that is, to solve their different ideological problems and practical problems. This is very meticulous and solid work, and it is the most basic work of mass movements. With this solid ideological mobilization work, there will be vigorous and conscious actions of the masses, and such mass movements can truly play a role in the three great revolutionary movements of enterprises.
    To run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, we must implement democratic centralism.
    Democratic centralism is in our Party Constitution and in our Constitution. Democratic centralism is the fundamental system of our Party building and also the fundamental system of our socialist construction.
    The premise of democratic centralism is democracy. Centralization is first and foremost the centralization of correct opinions. If there is no democracy, and the masses have opinions but have not spoken them, where do correct opinions come from, and where can they be centralized?
    The situations and problems of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments in enterprises are very complex. Those who truly understand these situations and problems are the broad masses of employees who are practicing in the three great revolutionary movements every day. Taking the formulation of plans and methods as an example, enterprise leaders only play the role of a "processing factory." If a factory does not have a sufficient quantity and appropriate quality of raw materials, it is impossible to manufacture good finished products. Only by fully promoting democracy, allowing the masses to put forward such and such opinions, and truthfully reflecting the situations and problems in all aspects, can enterprise leaders concentrate correct opinions and formulate appropriate plans and methods. Without democracy, without allowing cadres and the masses to fully express their opinions, with unclear situations and problems, and only deciding issues based on one-sided or untrue materials, it is inevitable that subjectivism will occur. Therefore, centralization without democracy can only be bureaucratic and commandist centralization, and what use is such centralization?
    To promote democracy, we must let the masses speak out freely, air their views fully, and hold great debates. This is a method of the masses educating the leaders and also a method of the masses educating themselves. Advocating this method can create a political situation in our enterprises that is both centralized and democratic, both disciplined and free, and both unified in will and personally comfortable and lively. With such a political situation, we can ensure that the broad masses of employees fully express their opinions on the enterprise's production, technology, and economic management. With such a political situation, we can ensure that the broad masses of employees dare to struggle against all phenomena that deviate from the Party's line, principles, and policies, and dare to struggle against all unhealthy tendencies and evil practices.
    All our organs and all our cadres should accept two kinds of supervision, one is the supervision from the leaders above, and the other is the supervision from the masses below. These two kinds of supervision are indispensable. Enterprises are of course no exception. This supervision from the masses below is very important and cannot be replaced by the supervision from the leaders above. Many problems in enterprises are often discovered by the employees of the enterprise before the leading organs have discovered them. With the supervision of the masses, various problems in the leading organs and leading cadres of the enterprise can be discovered and solved more timely. This is of very practical significance for ensuring the socialist direction of the enterprise. In this sense, democratic centralism is also a system that ensures the supervision of the enterprise leadership by the employees of the enterprise.
    To run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, we must adhere to continuous revolution and continuous progress in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, struggle for production, and scientific experiment.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The process of occurrence, development, and elimination in social practice is infinite, and the process of occurrence, development, and elimination of human knowledge is also infinite." Comrade Mao Zedong also said: "In the realm of the struggle for production and scientific experiment, mankind is always developing, and nature is always developing, and will never stop at one level. Therefore, mankind must constantly summarize experience, make discoveries, make inventions, make creations, and make progress."
    This is the theoretical basis for the continuous revolution and continuous progress of the three great revolutionary movements. How to adhere to continuous revolution and continuous progress? An important method is to summarize experience. Summarizing experience requires the use of the "one divides into two" viewpoint. We must both affirm achievements and expose shortcomings. At any time, our work will have these two aspects, the aspect of achievements and the aspect of shortcomings. Achievements will inspire confidence, and shortcomings can inhibit complacency. With both confidence and non-complacency, we can naturally continuously revolutionize and continuously progress. If there are only achievements and no shortcomings, then what is there to continue to move forward?
    In order to adhere to continuous revolution and continuous progress, every enterprise must have both long-term strategic goals and short-term tactical goals. Once a task is completed, a new task must be proposed immediately; once a peak is climbed, we must advance to another peak. The needs of the national economy are unlimited, and the development of science and technology is also unlimited. Any complacency and stagnation violate Mao Zedong Thought.
    The struggle for production and scientific experiment are like this, and so is class struggle. There is no once-and-for-all thing about class struggle and ideological transformation. If this struggle and transformation are relaxed, thoughts may go astray. Only by adhering to continuous revolution in class struggle can we continuously advance in the struggle for production and scientific experiment.
    To run enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought, we must ensure the absolute leadership of the Communist Party.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The force at the core leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party." The core force leading an enterprise is the Party organization of the enterprise. This Party organization must be Marxist-Leninist and must be armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Only with such a Party organization can we adhere to the socialist direction, can we adhere to the mass line, can we adhere to the implementation of democratic centralism, and can we adhere to continuous revolution, that is, can we adhere to running enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought.
    To ensure the Party's absolute leadership over the enterprise, there must be a revolutionary leadership team, that is, a revolutionary Party committee. The Party committee that runs enterprises according to Mao Zedong Thought must first study and apply Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a living way, and resolutely reverse the situation where leadership lags behind the masses in this regard. The fundamental method to reverse this situation is to work hard on the word "use" and to work hard on improving work and transforming thoughts. Only when leaders go deep into the front lines of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiment to study and use can they truly learn in a living way and use in a living way, can they closely combine leadership with the masses, can they closely combine individual guidance with general appeals, and can they closely combine the transformation of the objective world with the transformation of

    按照毛泽东思想办企业
    国家经济委员会、中共中央工业交通政治部，最近联合召开了全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议。这次会议，从总结经验入手，对于企业中怎样突出政治的问题，深入地开展了大检查，大辩论。经过检查和辩论，统一了思想，提高了认识。在企业中要进一步突出政治，就要进一步按照毛泽东思想办企业，这就是会议的结论。
    目前，我国工业交通战线，同全国其他战线一样，是一片大好形势。广大职工的阶级觉悟空前提高了，整个工业生产的面貌有所改变了，技术革新和技术革命大大发展了。这是三年大发展、三年调整、两年生产新高潮发展的必然结果，也是逐步自觉地运用毛泽东思想办企业的必然结果。但是，我们对这种大好形势还要作冷静的分析。我们只是开始有了自己的一些经验；我们只是开始改变着一穷二白的面貌；企业管理还没有形成一套完整的制度，干部中懂得用毛泽东思想办企业的还只有一部分。比起我们要赶上和超过世界先进水平的伟大目标来，比起我们要建设共产主义的伟大理想来，我们已有的成就只能使我们感到非常不足，而不应该有丝毫自满。
    我们党的社会主义建设总路线，是根据毛泽东同志的倡议制定的。按照总路线精神办企业，就是按照毛泽东思想办企业。经过八年的伟大实践，我们已经取得了自力更生，奋发图强，贯彻执行总路线的丰富经验，制定了一整套贯彻执行总路线的方针、政策和办法，同时出现了体现总路线精神的大庆和大批大庆式先进单位。这就有力地证明，按照毛泽东思想办企业的道路，是我国工业化唯一正确的道路。
    按照毛泽东思想办企业的基本之点有哪些呢？
    按照毛泽东思想办企业，就要以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，巩固和发展社会主义，避免修正主义，防止资本主义复辟，保证逐步走向共产主义。
    企业中的阶级斗争，常常表现为无产阶级思想和资产阶级思想两种思想的斗争，表现为走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的两条道路的斗争。比如企业的生产技术、经营管理、规章制度，是走我们自己的道路，还是照抄资本主义和修正主义的一套呢？是树立全心全意为用户服务，也就是为人民服务的思想呢？还是保持单纯任务观点和单纯盈利观点呢？是艰苦奋斗，坚持勤俭办企业的原则呢，还是贪图安逸，放弃勤俭办企业的原则呢？是培养集体主义精神和共产主义风格，还是助长资产阶级思想呢？是逐步缩小城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，还是保持和扩大这三个差别呢？这些统统是关系到企业向共产主义逐步前进还是向资本主义逐步倒退的大问题。我们必须抓住阶级斗争这条纲，坚持企业的社会主义方向。
    要坚持社会主义方向，要防止资本主义复辟，关键是要在企业中建立一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的产业大军。而要建立这样一支产业大军必须经过一场严重的兴无灭资的阶级斗争。那种以为我们的企业只有单一的工人阶级，并没有严重的阶级斗争的观点，既违反了马克思列宁主义的原理，又不符合社会主义企业的实际。一方面，社会主义企业是社会主义的一部分，企业同社会保持着千丝万缕的联系，社会上存在的阶级斗争，必然要反映到企业内部来，反映到工人阶级内部来，甚至反映到企业的党组织内部来。另一方面，我们企业中的职工，只有一部分是血统工人，更多的是不久以前的农民、城市小资产阶级和各种知识分子，要把这些非无产阶级出身的职工无产阶级化，不经过思想意识领域中的阶级斗争是不可能的。同时，企业中还有资产阶级分子和其他剥削阶级出身的分子。要使他们脱胎换骨，无产阶级化，不在政治上和思想上经过严重的阶级斗争，更是不可想象的。我们通常所说的做人的工作，实质上就是针对各种各样的活思想，对人进行阶级教育的工作，用无产阶级思想克服非无产阶级思想。
    阶级斗争同生产斗争同科学实验常常是联在一起的，企业中最大量的阶级斗争现象，也常常是通过生产斗争和科学实验表现出来的。我们强调三大革命运动一起抓，就是要以阶级斗争促生产斗争和科学实验，就是要用阶级斗争的观点，分析和处理生产斗争和科学实验中的各种问题，就是要把政治思想工作做到生产斗争和科学实验中去。这样，就把改造客观世界同改造人们的主观世界统一起来了，就把企业中的社会主义革命和社会主义建设统一起来了，就把企业的三大任务：出产品，出人材，出经验统一起来了。这样，企业的生产愈发展，企业的职工队伍就愈革命化。这样，企业在生产发展的同时，不仅为将来的共产主义准备着物质条件，也为将来的共产主义准备着精神条件。抓企业中的阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，是抓在企业中建立一支无产阶级的产业大军的关键，是从根本上保证企业沿着社会主义方向发展生产的关键，是从根本上防止资本主义复辟和修正主义产生的关键。
    按照毛泽东思想办企业，就要彻底走群众路线，大搞群众运动。
    毛泽东同志说：“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”
    社会主义企业，不仅是搞社会主义建设的，也是搞社会主义革命的。而且，社会主义建设中的生产斗争和科学实验也是伟大的革命运动。因此，办社会主义企业，必须按照毛泽东同志的教导，依靠人民群众大家动手去办，而不能只依靠少数人发号施令去办。这就必须把党的根本路线——群众路线贯彻到企业的三大革命运动中间去。这是区别社会主义企业同资本主义企业的一个根本标志，也是区别我们的社会主义企业同修正主义企业的一个根本标志。
    企业中生产的发展，要依靠广大群众，企业中技术的发展，也要依靠广大群众。对这一点，有的人还缺乏认识，或者还缺乏深刻的认识。我国的工人阶级，不但是国家的主人，不但是生产的主人，也完全应该成为科学技术的主人。他们丰富的实践经验，熟练的操作技术，使他们对企业生产技术上的问题有充分的发言权。无数事实证明在科学技术上能不能依靠广大群众，是科学技术能不能多快好省地发展的大问题。
    毛泽东同志的人民战争思想，是党的群众路线在战争中的具体运用。企业在发展科学技术中要贯彻群众路线，也应当运用毛泽东同志的人民战争思想。我们在企业中要加快“歼灭”科学技术上的“敌人”，仅仅靠技术人员这样的“正规军”是不行的，必须同时靠广大工人群众这样的“地方武装”和“民兵”。这就是我们提倡的领导干部、技术人员和工人群众的三结合。真正贯彻了三结合，也就真正在生产技术中贯彻了人民战争的思想，也就真正贯彻了生产技术中的群众路线。在企业中如果只在阶级斗争中和生产斗争中大搞群众运动，不同时在科学实验中大搞群众运动，只能算半截子群众路线，不能算彻底的群众路线。
    我们的社会主义企业，经过十几年的实践，已经取得了彻底走群众路线，大搞群众运动的丰富经验，开始有了一些彻底走群众路线，大搞群众运动的制度。两参一改三结合，就是一项带根本性的制度。两参是：干部以普通劳动者的姿态同工人一起参加劳动，工人以国家主人的身分同干部一起参加管理。一改是根据企业生产发展的实际情况，根据广大职工的实践经验，改革企业的规章制度，使企业的规章制度更加有利于调动广大职工的积极性和创造性，更加有利于企业生产的发展。三结合是在解决企业生产技术问题的时候，采取领导干部、技术人员和工人群众相结合的形式。两参一改三结合的制度是贯彻办企业的群众路线的制度，是有利于大搞群众运动的制度。认真执行这项制度，企业中大搞群众运动就有了保证。
    要大搞群众运动，必须消除对群众运动的误解。有人一听说群众运动，以为只是开大会，大轰大嗡。这种做法，实际上不是搞群众运动，而是搞形式主义。其结果，不仅不能真正调动广大群众的积极性，还会损害广大群众的积极性。真正的群众运动应当是在党的领导下，广大群众的自觉行动，这就要求企业的党组织对广大群众做深入的思想教育工作，也就是解决他们各不相同的思想问题和实际问题。这是非常细致而扎实的工作，这是群众运动的最基础的工作。有了这种扎扎实实的思想发动工作，才会有轰轰烈烈的群众自觉的行动，这样的群众运动，才能在企业的三大革命运动中真正发挥作用。
    按照毛泽东思想办企业，就要贯彻实行民主集中制。
    民主集中制是上了我们的党章，上了我们的宪法的。民主集中制是我们党的建设的根本制度，也是我们社会主义建设的根本制度。
    民主集中制的前提是民主。集中首先是集中正确的意见。如果没有民主，群众有意见还没有讲，从哪里来的正确意见，又从哪里集中呢？
    企业中的阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的情况和问题都很复杂。真正了解这些情况和问题的，是天天在三大革命运动中实践着的广大职工。拿制定计划和办法来说，企业领导者只是起一个“加工厂”的作用。工厂没有数量上充分的和质量上适当的原料，就不可能制造出好的成品来。企业领导者只有充分发扬民主，让群众提出这样那样意见，真实反映各方面的情况和问题，才能把正确的意见集中起来，制定出适当的计划和办法。如果没有民主，不让干部和群众充分发表意见，情况和问题不明，只凭着片面的或者不真实的材料决定问题，那就难免不是主观主义的。所以，没有民主的集中，只能是官僚主义、命令主义的集中，这种集中又有什么用呢？
    要发扬民主，就要让群众大鸣大放大辩论。这是群众教育领导的方法，也是群众自我教育的方法。提倡这种方法，就可以在我们的企业里，造成一种又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志、又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼的政治局面。有了这样的政治局面，才能保证广大职工群众对企业的生产、技术和经济管理，充分发表自己的意见。有了这样的政治局面，才能保证广大职工敢于同一切离开党的路线、方针、政策的现象作斗争，同一切歪风邪气作斗争。
    我们的一切机关和一切干部，应该接受两种监督，一种是来自上面的领导的监督，一种是来自下面的群众的监督。这两种监督缺一不可。企业当然不能例外。这种来自下面的群众的监督十分重要，是来自上面的领导的监督无法代替的。企业中的不少问题，往往领导机关还没有发现，企业中的职工群众就发现了。有了群众的监督，就可以更及时地发现和解决企业的领导机关和领导干部中的各种问题。这对保证企业的社会主义方向有非常现实的意义。就这一点说，民主集中制也是保证企业的职工群众监督企业领导的制度。
    按照毛泽东思想办企业，就要在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，坚持不断革命，不断前进。
    毛泽东同志说：“社会实践中的发生、发展和消灭的过程是无穷的，人的认识的发生、发展和消灭的过程也是无穷的。”毛泽东同志还说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”
    这就是三大革命运动要不断革命，不断前进的理论根据。如何坚持不断革命，不断前进呢？一个重要方法，就是总结经验。总结经验要用“一分为二”的观点。既要肯定成绩，又要揭露缺点。我们的工作，任何时候，都会有这样两个方面，成绩方面和缺点方面。成绩会鼓舞信心，缺点能抑制自满，既有信心，又不自满，自然能不断革命，不断前进。如果只有成绩，没有缺点，那还有什么继续前进问题呢。
    为了坚持不断革命，不断前进，每一个企业既要有长远的战略目标，又要有短期的战役目标。完成了一个任务，就要立即提出新的任务；攀登了一个高峰，就要向另一个高峰前进。国民经济的需要是无限的，科学技术的发展也是无限的。任何自满和停顿，都是违背毛泽东思想的。
    生产斗争和科学实验是如此，阶级斗争也是如此。阶级斗争、思想改造没有一劳永逸的事。这种斗争和改造一放松，思想就可能走到邪路上去。只有坚持阶级斗争方面的不断革命，才能使生产斗争和科学实验方面不断前进。
    按照毛泽东思想办企业，就要保证共产党的绝对领导。
    毛泽东同志说：“领导我们事业的核心力量是中国共产党。”领导一个企业的核心力量是企业的党组织。这个党组织必须是马克思列宁主义的，必须是用毛泽东思想武装起来的。有了这样的党组织，才能坚持社会主义方向，才能坚持走群众路线，才能坚持实行民主集中制，才能坚持不断革命，也就是说才能坚持按照毛泽东思想办企业。
    要保证党对企业的绝对领导，必须有一个革命化的领导班子，也就是革命化的党委会。按照毛泽东思想办企业的党委会，首先要活学活用毛泽东同志著作，坚决扭转在这方面领导落后于群众的状况。扭转这种状况的根本方法，就是要在用字上狠下功夫，在改进工作，改造思想上狠下功夫。领导者只有深入到阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验的第一线去学去用，才能真正学得活，用得活，才能使领导和群众密切结合起来，才能使个别指导和一般号召密切结合起来，才能使改造客观世界和改造主观世界密切结合起来。才能抓住企业中的主要矛盾，解决企业中的最关键的问题。这样的领导班子，才能算是革命化的领导班子。
    要保证党对企业的绝对领导，必须坚决贯彻党的一元化领导。这就是说，一方面，来自上级各个行政业务机关和群众团体的任务，一律要由企业的党委按照企业的情况统一部署，而不能超越企业的党委各行其事。另一方面，企业中任何系统的工作，如共青团、工会、妇女、民兵等等工作，都必须在企业党委统一领导下进行，首先保证企业的中心工作的完成，而不能各自为政。无数经验证明，没有一元化的领导，就不可能有坚强有力的领导。
    要保证党对企业的绝对领导，还要加强党的基层工作。这就要求党要管党，反对党不管党。这就要狠抓支部工作，加强对党员的教育，使每个党支部成为企业革命化的战斗堡垒，使每个党员成为革命化的战士。有了这样一支革命化的党的队伍，才会有革命化的产业大军，才会有革命化的企业。
    目前，在我国工业交通战线上，已经兴起了两个高潮，一个是生产高潮，一个是活学活用毛泽东同志著作的高潮。这两个高潮是互相影响，互相促进的。在生产高潮中，广大职工迫切需要从毛泽东同志著作中寻找解决问题和克服困难的“最高指示”；活学活用毛泽东同志著作的高潮，又大大推动着生产高潮的发展。这两个高潮的同时出现和密切结合，绝不是偶然的。这是广大职工自觉地抓革命促生产的产物，自觉地按照毛泽东思想办企业的产物。企业的领导者只要投身到这两个高潮中，抓住活学活用毛泽东同志著作的高潮，促进生产高潮，就可以保证按照毛泽东思想办企业，就可以保证生产高潮健康地发展，就可以保证第三个五年计划第一年的任务胜利完成，就可以保证我国的工业生产沿着正确的道路迅速前进。
