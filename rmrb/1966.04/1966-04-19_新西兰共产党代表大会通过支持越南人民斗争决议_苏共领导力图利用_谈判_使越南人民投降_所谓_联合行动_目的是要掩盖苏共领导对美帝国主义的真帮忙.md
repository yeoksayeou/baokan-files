    Xinhua News Agency, Auckland, 18th – The 21st National Congress of the New Zealand Communist Party, which closed on the 11th, passed a resolution supporting the struggle of the Vietnamese people. The resolution exposed that the Soviet leaders are using "negotiations" as a smokescreen, attempting to make the Vietnamese people surrender. Their so-called "joint action" is nothing more than a trap set for the unwary, its purpose being to cover up the genuine assistance the Soviet leaders are giving to imperialism. The resolution stated that the New Zealand Communist Party will fully launch and participate in the struggle against U.S. aggression in Vietnam.

    The resolution said: "The war waged by the United States and its lackeys in Vietnam is a war of imperialist plunder and aggression, a war to suppress the independence of the Vietnamese people and promote Washington's ambition to dominate the world."

    "The Vietnamese people refuse to be slaves of the United States and the successive puppet regimes it has supported. They have stood up and are fighting for national liberation and basic human rights."

    "Their war is a just war, a war of ninety percent of the people against imperialist enslavement. Such a people's war will surely be victorious, because it will also receive the support of all class-conscious workers and genuine democrats throughout the world."

    The resolution pointed out: "Despite the huge military equipment of the U.S. aggressors, and despite the modern revisionists who lead the Soviet Party and the Soviet state supporting the U.S. imperialists behind the scenes, this people's war will still be victorious. The Soviet leaders publicly flaunt their 'aid' to North Vietnam, but privately guarantee that this aid will not reach a scale that would irritate the U.S. government. In fact, the U.S. government regards the Soviet leaders as allies, because they are using 'negotiations' as a smokescreen, attempting to make the Vietnamese people surrender."

    "Under these circumstances, the New Zealand Communist Party cannot believe the Soviet leaders' claim that they are seeking joint action on the Vietnam issue to oppose U.S. imperialism. Their words and actions are inconsistent. This 'joint action' is nothing more than a trap set for the unwary, its purpose being to cover up the genuine assistance the Soviet leaders are giving to imperialism."

    The resolution pointed out: "The great international movement against the U.S. aggressors has developed. More and more American people themselves are waking up to the fact that the war waged by the U.S. government in Vietnam is an aggressive colonial war. Hundreds of thousands of American people have stood up to engage in open struggle against this war, which is a new and important factor in the world political situation."

    The resolution condemned the New Zealand government's action of sending troops to participate in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, and pointed out that "in New Zealand, the great movement against sending troops to support U.S. aggression has developed into a movement demanding the recall of troops, and it is bound to grow further."

    The resolution finally emphasized: "The Congress declares that the New Zealand Communist Party will do its utmost to launch and participate in the mass movement against the U.S. war of enslavement in Vietnam and against the use of New Zealand troops to support this war.

    "The Congress declares that the National Liberation Front, which is supported by ninety percent of the people of South Vietnam, is the only organization entitled to represent them. Recent events have shown that the U.S. puppet Nguyen Cao Ky government has absolutely no support among the people.

    "The Congress declares its full support for the four-point proposition put forward by the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front in March 1965, considering them to be the only basis for achieving peace in Vietnam.

    "The Congress demands: an immediate halt to U.S. attacks on North Vietnam, and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South.

    "Immediate recall of all New Zealand troops in Vietnam.

    "Recognition of the Vietnamese people's right to decide their own social system, form of government, and the reunification of their country."

    新西兰共产党代表大会通过支持越南人民斗争决议
    苏共领导力图利用“谈判”使越南人民投降
    所谓“联合行动”目的是要掩盖苏共领导对美帝国主义的真帮忙
    新华社十八日讯　奥克兰消息：十一日闭幕的新西兰共产党第二十一次全国代表大会通过了关于支持越南人民斗争的决议。决议揭露苏联领导人正在利用“谈判”作为幌子，力图使越南人民投降。他们所谓的“联合行动”不过是给缺乏警惕性的人安排的一个圈套，其目的是要掩盖苏共领导人正在对帝国主义进行的真帮忙。决议说，新西兰共产党将全力展开和参加反对美国侵略越南的斗争。
    决议说：“美国及其仆从在越南进行的战争是帝国主义的掠夺和侵略战争，是压制越南人民的独立和促进华盛顿称霸世界的目的的战争。”
    “越南人民拒绝做美国和美国扶植的历届伪政权的奴隶。他们站起来了，正在为民族解放和基本人权而斗争。
    “他们的战争是正义的战争，是百分之九十的人民反对帝国主义奴役的战争。这样的人民战争一定会胜利，因为它也会得到全世界一切有阶级觉悟的工人和真正的民主人士的支持。”
    决议指出：“尽管美国侵略者有庞大的军备，尽管领导苏联党和苏维埃国家的现代修正主义者在幕后支持美帝国主义者，这场人民战争还是会胜利。苏联领导人当众炫耀他们对越南北方的‘援助’，但是私下里却保证，这种援助不会达到使美国政府恼火的规模。事实上，美国政府把苏联领导人看成盟友，因为他们用‘谈判’作为幌子，力图使越南人民投降。
    “在这种情况下，新西兰共产党无法相信苏共领导人所谓他们在越南问题上谋求联合行动来反对美帝国主义这种说法。他们言行不一。这种‘联合行动’不过是给缺乏警惕的人安排的一个圈套，其目的是要掩盖苏共领导人正在对帝国主义进行的真帮忙。”
    决议指出：“国际上反对美国侵略者的伟大运动已经发展起来。越来越多的美国人民自己正在醒悟到，美国政府在越南进行的战争是侵略性的殖民主义战争。数十万美国人民挺身出来进行反对这场战争的公开斗争，这是世界政局中一个新的重要因素。”
    决议谴责新西兰政府派兵参加美国侵越战争的行动，并且指出，“在新西兰，反对派兵支持美国侵略的伟大运动，已经发展成为要求召回军队的运动，而且势必进一步壮大。”
    决议最后强调：“代表大会宣布，新西兰共产党将竭尽全力来展开和参加反对美国在越南进行的奴役战争、反对用新西兰军队支持这场战争的群众运动。
    “代表大会宣布，得到百分之九十的越南南方人民支持的民族解放阵线是有权代表他们的唯一组织。最近的事件表明，美国傀儡阮高其政府在人民中间完全得不到支持。
    “代表大会宣告它完全支持越南民主共和国政府提出的四项主张和民族解放阵线一九六五年三月的五点声明，认为它们是实现越南和平的唯一基础。
    “代表大会要求：立即停止美国对越南北方的袭击，美国军队从南方撤走。
    “立即召回在越南的全部新西兰军队。
    “承认越南人民决定自己的社会制度、政府形式和自己国家的重新统一问题的权利。”
