    A Model for the Revolutionization of Rural Health Clinics
    ——Remembering the Qinglong Health Clinic's Emphasis on Politics and Adherence to the Socialist Direction
    In the Liupan Mountains, through which the Red Army passed during the Long March, there is a rural health clinic warmly praised by the masses—the Qinglong Health Clinic of Anguo Commune in Pingliang County, Gansu. Here, three young medical workers, listening to Chairman Mao's words, wholeheartedly serve more than three thousand four hundred people in the mountainous area, making outstanding achievements. They are called "the confidants of the poor and lower-middle peasants" and "doctors like Bethune." Their health clinic is praised as a new type of hospital holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and a good example of the revolutionization of rural health clinics.
    What attitude should one have towards revolution?
    The Qinglong area, located at the junction of Gansu and Ningxia, includes five brigades and more than three thousand four hundred commune members. There was originally a health clinic here, funded by the masses, but it closed down after the four doctors who were hired either became ill and returned home or left due to hardship. It was very inconvenient for the commune members to see a doctor, as they had to travel more than twenty li of mountain road to the commune health center. In 1962, according to the demands of the local people, the county sent Communist Party member Yang Peiqing and another graduate of a secondary health school to rebuild the health clinic.
    Yang Peiqing had served as a medic in the People's Liberation Army. After his demobilization, he worked in the county hospital and the commune health center. When the organization decided to send him to work in the Qinglong area, he packed his bags and set off without hesitation.
    He led the graduate of the health school across mountains and valleys to the Qinglong Health Clinic. At that time, they were greeted by extremely difficult working conditions. Opening the door of the clinic, they saw two old rooms with a leaky roof and windows without panes; a broken medicine cabinet containing only seven simple Western medicines and some infrequently used Chinese medicines; and no place to sleep. Seeing this situation, the graduate's heart sank, and he regretfully said, "This is a hellhole! If I had known it would be like this, I wouldn't have come at all." But Yang Peiqing smiled and said, "Where is there no difficulty in revolution? Who will build skyscrapers in the mountains and then invite you to come! The Party has sent us here, so we must resolutely do it." He immediately began to tidy up the house and borrowed some medicines and equipment from the commune health center. They ate meals temporarily at commune members' homes and slept on the same kang as the caretaker. The long-closed clinic quickly began to receive patients.
    Just as the work was getting off the ground, his companion left the clinic in less than half a year because he was afraid of hardship and fatigue.
    The clinic's conditions were still so poor, and there was no helper. How could one person continue to work? Yang Peiqing thought over and over again, unable to sleep for several nights in a row. He recalled his combat life in the army and the instructions of the army leaders: a revolutionary must always listen to the Party, endure great hardship and heavy labor, never fade, and carry the revolution through to the end. He opened Chairman Mao's article "Serve the People," and his eyes lingered on this passage for a long time: "When our comrades are in difficulty, we must see achievements, see the light, and increase our courage." Chairman Mao's words illuminated his heart and encouraged his fighting spirit. He made up his mind: resolutely face the difficulties and continue! He reported his thoughts to the commune Party committee, and received enthusiastic encouragement: "You're thinking correctly! The masses here need doctors very much, so you must work hard. If you have difficulties, we will study and solve them."
    Fundamentally solve the problem of world outlook
    Soon, in order to strengthen this rural health clinic position, the Party selected Song Zhiming, a local poor peasant intellectual youth, to be the pharmacist, and Wang Zixin, a trainee of traditional Chinese medicine from the county hospital, to serve as a traditional Chinese medicine doctor. Yang Peiqing happily thought: Now we have a full staff. However, Wang Zixin, who grew up in the county seat and worked in the county hospital, frowned and shook his head as soon as he arrived at the clinic: "Three cave dwellings are desolate, there is no diagnosis table, the thigh serves as a support..." Seeing this sign, Yang Peiqing sincerely said to him: "Traditional Chinese medicine is very much needed here. Coming here requires learning the spirit of hard struggle of Yan'an in those years. You cannot be like the south goose seeking food in the north, returning home when the climate is cold. We are young people of the Mao Zedong era, we must settle down, take root, and not be afraid of difficulties or hardship!" After many attempts to help him, Wang Zixin began to settle down.
    How can we truly make everyone take root in the mountains and work for a lifetime? Yang Peiqing thought: We must organize everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, establish a revolutionary world outlook, and fundamentally solve the problem. Who knew that as soon as he mentioned this, Wang Zixin said: "I already studied it in school." Yang Peiqing patiently replied: "It depends on how you studied! Our study must be connected to our own thoughts." From then on, they took a decisive step. They successively studied articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "The Orientation of the Youth Movement," "Combat Liberalism," and "On Contradiction." They studied whenever they were free, and discussed them at night while lying on the kang. They conscientiously examined their thoughts and constantly improved their awareness. Wang Zixin wrote a new page in his diary: "...This lesson of Bethune made me clear: it is most meaningful for a person to live for the working people. I want to work hard in a down-to-earth manner, establish the idea of serving the people, and constantly transform myself." They also seriously studied articles against modern revisionism and consciously prevented the invasion of bourgeois ideology. Once, they discussed the article "Is Yugoslavia a Socialist Country?" Yang Peiqing said: "Let's mainly see how Yugoslavia changed? What caused the change? What should we do so that we don't change!" Song Zhiming asked: "How can our little health clinic in this mountain valley change?" Yang Peiqing replied: "I think that if bourgeois ideology is allowed to rise, it will gradually change for the worse! We are far from the leadership and our lives are hard, so we must firmly stand our ground and not take the capitalist road!" Their conclusion was: if we want to not change, we must completely listen to the Party, take the socialist road, do what Chairman Mao says, and do whatever the Party tells us to do!
    Mao Zedong Thought inspired their revolutionary enthusiasm and energy. Yang Peiqing became even more strict with himself in every way. He took the lead in shouldering heavy burdens and used practical actions to influence and motivate everyone. He and Wang Zixin successively moved their wives and children from the suburbs to the Qinglong mountainous area, settled down and were determined to serve the people in the mountainous area for a lifetime. Under Yang Peiqing's leadership, the three of them marched forward by leaps and bounds towards the goal of revolutionization!
    "Learn the hard-bone spirit of the old Eighth Route Army"
    With Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, no difficulties could scare them. In order to reduce the burden on the state, the commune, and the masses, and better serve the patients, they put forward a fighting slogan: resolutely listen to Chairman Mao's words, learn the hard-bone spirit of the old Eighth Route Army, work hard, rely on our own efforts, and run the clinic diligently and thriftily! Use our own hands to create conditions and improve conditions. They said: "If we're poor, we'll use poor methods!" A three-legged table became their "omnipotent table" for seeing patients, giving injections, and calculating accounts; when there was no place to put medicine, they used adobe bricks to support wooden boards as medicine shelves; when there was no prescription paper, they used waste paper instead; when there were no oil lamps, they used medicine bottles to modify them. They would rather endure more hardship and fatigue and save every penny of expense. The commune allocated three old cave dwellings, and they carried water, mixed mud, plastered walls, built kangs, and built pot stoves themselves, and also used waste materials to make some furniture. A dip pen nib only cost three or four cents, and they only bought two in two years. Song Zhiming became the "red housekeeper" of the health clinic. He cherished every piece of paper, every piece of gauze, every cotton ball, and every small medicine bottle. When there was a shortage of Chinese medicine, they took advantage of the gaps between outpatient visits to collect medicinal materials in the mountains. The medicines purchased by the health clinic were all carried back by themselves from the county seat more than sixty li away. In 1963, Song Zhiming went to the city for the first time to carry medicine and spent one yuan and two jiao on staying in a hotel for one night, which he felt sorry for for a long time. From then on, every time he went to the city, he brought his own dry food and stayed in a cheap inn, spending only two jiao and five fen a night. Someone asked him: "Staying in a hotel and taking a car can be reimbursed, why do you have to suffer this crime?" He replied: "Serving the people should be like this."
    In this way, they worked hard, diligently and thriftily, and added some necessary medicines and equipment to the health clinic, making the conditions of the health clinic better day by day. The poor and lower-middle peasants said with satisfaction: "Chairman Mao has led these young people on the right path! The health clinic looks like it should!"
    The struggle between two medical ideologies
    Here, the mountains undulate, the ravines are crisscrossed, and more than six hundred and thirty Han and Hui commune members live in forty-five small villages. The health clinic is located in the central Dazhuang Village, which is three or four li away from the surrounding villages at the shortest and seventeen or eighteen li away at the longest.
    Faced with such a working environment, the three young medical workers first considered not their own difficulties, but the needs of the masses. They thought: It is so difficult for the masses to climb mountains and valleys to see a doctor! They put forward another fighting slogan: turn the mountain health clinic into a field hospital, to better serve the masses! This slogan seems simple, but it is not easy to achieve, which is the result of the struggle of two roads in the health clinic. When the health clinic was first restored in 1962, it proposed "four don'ts": don't see patients who are in debt, don't see patients who don't pay the consultation fee first, don't see patients in bad weather and at night, and don't see patients with critical illnesses. The commune members criticized: "If you don't see this and don't see that, it's either for money or you're a lazy person." Now, Yang Peiqing and others have completely cut off this bad style of "four don'ts" and established a revolutionary style of wholeheartedly serving the people in mountainous areas, which is enthusiastic, hardworking, patient, responsible, careful, proactive, simple, and economical, and established a consultation system that does not distinguish between day and night, mountains and distance, good and bad weather, festivals and New Years, and county and commune boundaries. In this health clinic, twenty-four hours a day is the time to see patients, patients are treated as soon as they arrive, there is no such thing as going to work and getting off work, and there is no such thing as festivals and holidays. The three medical workers often eat breakfast as soon as it dawns and start seeing patients. Lunch and dinner are only a little dry food eaten in the gaps between seeing patients, and patients are never made to wait long. They said: "It is better for one person to accommodate everyone than to make everyone wait for one person."
    Considering that it is inconvenient for the masses to climb mountains and valleys with illnesses, they spend most of their time on mobile medical treatment and home visits. In recent years, they have traveled all the small paths and mountains in the Qinglong mountainous area. One evening in early winter of 1964, they were lighting lamps and starting to make dinner when suddenly several people came to ask for outpatient visits, and the conditions of the patients in two places were still very serious. At this time, the gale was roaring in the valley, and rain mixed with snow was flying in the air. Yang Peiqing looked at the sky and said to Wang Zixin: "Whether we are truly serving the people or pretending to serve the people, tonight is a test. Let's have a great exercise in wind and snow!" The two immediately put on straw hats, held wooden sticks, and set off into the wind and snow. According to the patients' conditions, they first climbed mountains and valleys to Dongzhuang to treat the malignant carbuncles and boils that caused poisoning in the 70-year-old man Li Deyi. Then they set off for Taiyangzui. Taiyangzui is the highest mountain peak in this area. Li Dezhi's grandson, Li Guizhou, dissuaded them: "That's the road that monkeys take. It's dark and snowy. How can you go up? Why don't you stay at my place?" They said: "There are patients waiting there, we must go!" Seeing that they were determined to go, Li Guizhou carried an iron shovel to lead the way for them. The rain and snow continued to fall, and the road could not be distinguished. When they reached the foot of Taiyangzui Mountain, Wang Zixin felt a little timid when he saw the steep mountain peak. Yang Peiqing encouraged him: "Haven't you seen revolutionary war movies? When the People's Liberation Army is carrying out combat missions, even a mountain of knives and a sea of fire can't stop them. What is this little difficulty? Go!" Saying that, he took the lead and climbed up. It was dark and the road was slippery, so they put their hands on the ground and climbed and groped until they finally climbed to the top of the mountain. After diagnosing and treating the dysmenorrhea and systemic joint pain of female commune member Zhu Yuying, they immediately turned to Xu Jiagou on the back mountain to see Li Maolin's wife. At this time, it was already two o'clock in the morning, and they knocked on Li Maolin's door. The old man was so moved when he saw that they were covered in mud and water that had frozen into ice that he said repeatedly: "Come in, come in! In the old society, even a horse could not bring a doctor, but now it's almost dawn, and you still come to find patients. This is really a change in the world!" Yang Peiqing said: "This is the work that we doctors should do, and we are not doing enough. In the future, if you have a disease, send a message and we will come." After seeing the patients here, they went to another place until the sun rose on the top of the mountain the next day, ending the outpatient visit on the night of wind and snow. That night, they did not drink a sip of water, crossed five mountains, passed six ravines, and ran more than forty li to see seven commune members in four mountain villages.
    This revolutionary spirit of thinking about the masses everywhere and providing all convenience to patients is also reflected in other aspects of medical work. In order to reduce the economic burden of the masses in seeing a doctor, they often repeatedly deliberate on prescribing a prescription, so that the medicine prescribed can not only cure the disease, but also be relatively economical, and try to use folk methods such as acupuncture and cupping for treatment. In 1964 alone, they provided free acupuncture to more than 350 poor and lower-middle peasants. Some patients can return the remaining medicine if they have recovered from the disease before the medicine is finished to get the price back. Whether it is for patients or family members who accompany the patients, they are treated warmly. If they want to drink water, there is boiling water; if they want to decoct medicine, there are fire pots and medicine pots. If they can't go back due to the late hour or serious illness, they let the patients sleep on their kang. Once, Wang Wujun and his wife, commune members from Guyuan County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, brought their children to the health clinic for treatment, but they did not bring food or a place to live. Wang Zixin cooked for them, decocted medicine for the children, and let them sleep on their kang. They always answered the questions raised by the patients patiently. Some patients were irritable and had a bad attitude, but they did not care, and patiently comforted and persuaded them. For some older patients, they had to repeatedly instruct them on how to take the medicine after prescribing it.
    Daring to shoulder heavy burdens for the people
    The Qinglong Health Clinic has successively cured more than forty cases of critical illnesses, which has been spread as a good story in the Liupan Mountain area. Yang Peiqing said: Technically, we are very low, our conditions are very poor, and we have very few medicines, but if the poor and lower-middle peasants have a disease, we have the responsibility to treat it. As long as we have a high spirit of serving the people and a scientific attitude, we can make technology and medicine play a better role.
    One day in the summer harvest season of 1964, commune members Zhang Shengrong and Yang Zhanhai from the Lajiawan Production Team of Guanzhuang Brigade were burned, and their injuries were very serious. Yang Peiqing and Wang Zixin had not only never treated such burns, but had never even seen them. According to this situation, the patients should be sent to the county hospital for treatment immediately. However, Lajiawan is more than sixty li away from the county seat, the mountains are high and the slopes are steep, and it was raining heavily at the time, so the patients could not be sent out.
    What to do? Yang Peiqing was hesitating when he heard Zhang Shengrong, who was in a semi-coma, say: "My injury is not serious, there is no need to go to the city. You hurry up and grab the wheat!" Yang Peiqing was deeply moved by Zhang Shengrong's noble qualities and decided to do everything possible on the spot to save these two class brothers. The commune Party committee also supported them in rescuing them locally.
    How to rescue? They took out the "Rural Medical Officer's Manual," but the measures mentioned in the book, such as skin grafting, blood transfusion, and injection of tetanus antitoxin, could not be done here. Yang Peiqing said: "We must respect science and technology, but we cannot blindly believe in books and mechanically apply frameworks. If we mechanically apply them, we will only feel that there is no way." They finally decided: "If Western medicine is not enough, traditional Chinese medicine will participate in the battle. If there is no foreign method, we will use local methods."
    The first difficulty encountered was how to prevent infection. It was summer, and the patients lived in cave dwellings, and the sanitation conditions were very poor. After analysis, they believed that the possibility of infection was very high, but it was not absolutely impossible to avoid. The lack of sterile wards and medicines is not terrible, what is terrible is passive waiting and carelessness. In response to this situation, they proposed: "Strictness first," sprayed the cave dwellings, earthen kangs, and bedding with drugs, and washed and steamed the clothes and utensils. Before each dressing change, they sprayed the room with disinfectant and exposed the bedding to the sun. Finally, they overcame this difficulty.
    Zhang Shengrong, who was more seriously injured, was in a coma twice in a row on the third and sixth days and lost consciousness. Preventing shock was another difficulty faced by the two doctors. At that time, the health clinic's existing twenty-two ampoules of glucose and two thousand milligrams of ascorbic acid had all been used up. The heavy rain continued to fall, and it was difficult to seek assistance from other places. They decided to find a solution from traditional Chinese medicine. After repeated consideration, Wang Zixin prescribed a large dose of traditional Chinese medicine for the patient. After taking the medicine, the patient was effective and played a role in anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and anti-shock. Then, according to rural experience, they gave the patient chicken soup, sugar water, tea water, sour pulp water, and cabbage soup to replenish a large amount of water.
    During the rescue process, the most difficult thing was changing the dressing. Each dressing change brought a lot of pain to the patient, and they felt very uneasy. They did not dislike trouble and fatigue, and took turns to change the dressing. Today, they changed this piece, and tomorrow they changed that piece. They changed it for a while and stopped for a while, trying to reduce the patient's pain as much as possible. Each dressing change lasted five or six hours, and sometimes their waists could not be straightened. Yang Peiqing once fainted during the dressing change due to overwork. However, he always maintained an optimistic mood and a strong fighting spirit, and never said he was tired or complained. As a result, after twenty-two days and thirty-odd days respectively, they finally cured the two patients with burns covering 46.7% and 23% of their body surface area.
    The news of the victory of the Qinglong Health Clinic in rescuing patients with large-area burns quickly spread around the Liupan Mountains, and many medical workers from Pingliang Prefecture and County and the stationed troops traveled over mountains and rivers to visit. They unanimously believed that this was a pioneering work on the rural health front. The three medical workers of the Qinglong Health Clinic also made a summary themselves, saying: The direction was given by Chairman Mao, the enthusiasm was encouraged by the Party Committee, the waist was supported by the masses, and the methods were thought of by everyone.
    Practice hard skills for the revolution
    How to continuously improve medical technology and better serve the people in the mountainous area is a question that the three young medical workers of the Qinglong Health Clinic often consider. Yang Peiqing, who studied Western medicine, saw that the local people liked to see traditional Chinese medicine, so he was determined to learn traditional Chinese medicine. He studied traditional Chinese medicine books and periodicals on his own, collected folk methods, and went to ask two old traditional Chinese medicine doctors for advice one hundred and fifty li away. He repeatedly read subjects such as drug properties, soup heads, pathology, and diagnosis, and posted soup head songs on the wall, learning while using, and using while learning. Now, he has mastered more than thirty commonly used traditional Chinese medicine prescriptions and more than sixty acupuncture points. Wang Zixin, who studied traditional Chinese medicine, saw that there were more gynecological diseases in the mountainous area, so he got up early and stayed up late to study gynecology, and now he has memorized the "Gynecological Heart Method Secret" and accumulated some practical experience. Song Zhiming, who only had a primary school education, originally did not know medicines or medicinal materials, let alone drug names or drug properties. Seeing that his work urgently needed him to master this knowledge as soon as possible, he was determined to learn while doing and do while learning. For Western medicine, he asked Yang Peiqing; for traditional Chinese medicine, he asked Wang Zixin. In this way, after two years of hard work, he not only memorized all kinds of Chinese and Western medicines and was able to skillfully grab and take medicines; he also learned more than two hundred kinds of traditional Chinese medicine preparation methods and mastered nursing techniques such as injection and application of medicine.
    They realized that in order to fundamentally reduce the harm of diseases to the masses, they must resolutely implement the policy of "prevention first" and eliminate diseases before they occur. Therefore, in the past two years, they have often publicized health and labor protection knowledge to the masses, publicized methods of preventing diseases, and went door-to-door to inject vaccines. Last year, they also trained a group of health workers and midwives who did not leave production for each production brigade, making it more convenient for the masses to see a doctor.

### 农村卫生所革命化的榜样——记青龙卫生所突出政治坚持社会主义的方向

    农村卫生所革命化的榜样
    ——记青龙卫生所突出政治坚持社会主义的方向
    当年红军长征经过的六盘山区，有一个受到群众热烈赞扬的农村卫生所——甘肃平凉县安国公社青龙卫生所。在这里，三名青年医务人员，听毛主席的话，全心全意地为山区三千四百多人服务，作出了非常出色的成绩。他们被称做“贫下中农的知心人”、“白求恩式的医生”。他们的卫生所被称赞是高举毛泽东思想红旗的新型医院，是农村卫生所革命化的好榜样。
    用什么态度干革命？
    青龙地区在甘肃、宁夏交界的地方，包括五个大队、三千四百多个社员。这里原有一个群众集资办起来的卫生所，因为先后请来的四个医生，有的生病回家，有的怕苦而去，停办了多年。社员看病，得跑二十多里山路到公社卫生院，非常不便。一九六二年，根据当地群众的要求，县里派共产党员杨培清和另一个中级卫生学校的毕业生一起，到这里来重建卫生所。
    杨培清，曾经在人民解放军里当过卫生员，复员后先后在县医院、公社卫生院工作过。当组织上决定让他去青龙地区工作时，他毫不迟疑地背起行李出发了。
    他领着那个卫生学校的毕业生，翻山越岭来到了青龙卫生所。那时，迎接他们的是十分困难的工作条件。打开卫生所的门一看，两间旧房，屋顶露天，有窗无櫺；一个破药柜，只放着七种简单的西药和一些不常用的中药；连睡觉的地方也没有。看到这种情况，那个毕业生心里凉了半截，后悔地说：“这个鬼地方！早知这样，我根本就不来。”杨培清却笑了笑说：“干革命哪里没有困难？谁在山沟里建设起高楼大厦，再请你来！党把我们派来了，就要坚决干。”他立刻动手收拾了房子，又到公社卫生院借来一些药品器械。他们吃饭，临时到社员家里吃；睡觉，和饲养员挤在一个炕上。关门很久的卫生所，很快开始接待病人了。
    工作刚刚有了一些头绪，他的那位同伴因为怕苦怕累，不到半年就离开了卫生所。
    卫生所条件还这么差，又没有个帮手，一个人怎么继续工作呢？杨培清反来复去地想着，一连几夜没睡好觉。他想起了在部队时的战斗生活，想起了部队首长的教导：一个革命者，要永远听党的话，吃大苦耐大劳，永不褪色，革命到底。他打开毛主席《为人民服务》的文章，目光长久地停留在这段话上：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”毛主席的话照亮了他的心，鼓舞了他的斗志，他打定主意：坚决顶着困难干下去！他把自己的思想向公社党委作了汇报，得到了热情的鼓励：“你想得对！这里的群众很需要医生，一定要好好干下去。有困难咱们研究解决。”
    从根本上解决世界观问题
    不久，党为了加强这个农村卫生所阵地，挑选当地贫农知识青年宋志明来当司药，又从县医院调来中医出师的学徒王自新担任中医大夫。杨培清高兴地想着：这一下算是人员齐备了。可是，长在县城、工作在县医院的王自新，刚到卫生所，就皱眉摇头地说：“三孔窑洞冷清清，没有诊断桌，大腿来顶……。”杨培清看到这个苗头，诚恳地对他说：“这里很需要中医。到这里来，就要学习当年延安的艰苦奋斗作风。不能象南雁寻食飞北方，气候寒冷就还乡。我们是毛泽东时代的青年，一定要安下心，扎下根，不怕困难，不怕艰苦！”经过多次帮助，王自新开始安下心来。
    怎样才能使大家真正在山区扎下根，干一辈子呢？杨培清想：必须组织大家学习毛主席著作，树立革命的世界观，从根本上解决问题。谁知刚提起这事，王自新就说：“我在学校里早就学过了。”杨培清耐心地回答：“那要看是怎么学的！咱们学习一定要联系自己的思想才行。”从此，他们迈出了具有决定意义的一步。他们先后学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《青年运动的方向》、《反对自由主义》、《矛盾论》等文章。他们有空就学，晚上躺在炕上讨论。他们认真地检查思想，不断地提高觉悟。王自新在日记里写下了新的一页：“……白求恩这一课使我明确了：一个人为了劳动人民而活着才是最有意义的。我要踏踏实实埋头苦干，树立为人民服务的思想，不断改造自己。”他们还认真学习了反对现代修正主义的文章，自觉地防止资产阶级思想侵袭。一次，他们讨论《南斯拉夫是社会主义国家吗？》这篇文章，杨培清说：“咱们主要看南斯拉夫是怎么变的？是什么原因变的？咱们要怎样做才不会变！”宋志明问道：“咱这山沟里的小小卫生所能咋样变？”杨培清回答：“我看，要是让资产阶级思想抬头，就会逐步朝坏的方面变！我们离领导远，生活又艰苦，要坚决站稳立场，不能走资本主义道路！”他们得出的结论是：要想不变，就要完完全全听党的话，走社会主义道路，毛主席说什么就做什么，党叫干啥就干啥！
    毛泽东思想鼓起了他们的革命热情和干劲。杨培清更加处处严格要求自己了。他带头挑重担子，用实际行动影响和带动大家。他和王自新，先后把自己的爱人和孩子从城郊迁到青龙山区，扎根落户，决心为山区人民服务一辈子。在杨培清的带动下，三个人大踏步地朝着革命化的目标前进！
    “学习老八路的硬骨头精神”
    有了毛泽东思想作统帅，什么困难都吓不倒他们。为减轻国家、公社和群众的负担，更好地为病人服务，他们提出了战斗的口号：坚决听毛主席的话，学习老八路的硬骨头精神，艰苦奋斗，自力更生，勤俭办所！用自己的双手创造条件，改善条件。他们说：“穷，咱们就用穷的办法！”一张三条腿桌子，成了他们看病、打针、算账的“万能桌”；药品没处放，就用土坯支起木板当药架；没有处方纸，就用废纸代替；没有油灯，就用药瓶改装。他们宁愿多吃一点苦，多受一点累，节约一分一厘的开支。公社拨给三孔旧窑洞，他们自己动手担水、和泥、抹墙、盘炕、砌锅台，还利用废料制作了一些家具。蘸水笔尖一个只三四分钱，两年来他们只买了两个。宋志明成了卫生所的“红管家”。他对一片纸、一块纱布、一个棉球、一个小药瓶，都非常珍惜。中药不足，他们便趁出诊的空隙，到山上采集药材。卫生所购买的药品，都是他们自己从六十多里外的县城背回来的。一九六三年，宋志明第一次进城背药，住了一夜旅馆花了一元二角钱，心痛了好久。从此以后，他每次进城都自带干粮，住车马小店，一夜只花两角五分钱。有人问他：“住店，搭车都能报销，你何必受这个罪？”他答道：“为人民服务，就应该这样。”
    他们就这样艰苦奋斗，勤俭节约，给卫生所多添置了一些必需的药品、器械，使卫生所的条件一天天好起来。贫下中农满意地说：“毛主席把这几个年青人引在正路上了！卫生所象个样子了！”
    两种医疗思想的斗争
    这里山岭起伏，沟壑纵横，六百三十多户汉、回族社员，分别居住在四十五个小庄。卫生所设在居中的大庄村，距离周围村庄少则三四里，多则十七八里。
    面对这样的工作环境，三位青年医务人员首先考虑的不是自己的困难，而是群众的要求。他们想：这里出门就得爬山翻沟，群众到卫生所看一次病多么不容易啊！他们提出了另一个战斗口号：山区卫生所野战医院化，更好地为群众服务！这个口号看来简单，要做到是不容易的，这是卫生所两条道路斗争的结果。在一九六二年卫生所刚刚恢复的时候，曾经提出“四不看”：欠账不看、不先交出诊费不看、天气不好和夜间不看、危重病不看。社员批评说：“这不看，那不看，一是为钱，二是懒汉。”现在，杨培清他们彻底砍掉了这个“四不看”的坏作风，建立起热情、吃苦、耐心、负责、细心、主动、简便、省钱的全心全意为山区人民服务的革命作风，建立了不分昼夜、不分山高路远、不分好坏天气、不分节日过年、不分县社界线的应诊制度。在这个卫生所里，一天二十四小时都是看病时间，病人随到随治，无所谓上班下班，也无所谓节日假日。三位医务人员常常是天一亮就吃罢早饭开始看病，午饭和晚饭只在看病空隙吃一点干粮，从不使病人久等。他们说：“宁可一人就大家，不使大家等一人。”
    他们考虑到群众带病翻山越岭就医不便，就用大部分时间进行巡回医疗、上门看病。几年来，他们踏遍了青龙山区的每条小径，每个山头。一九六四年初冬的一个傍晚，他们正点灯动手做晚饭，忽然几处来请出诊，有两处的病人病情还很严重。这时，狂风在山谷里吼叫，雨搅着雪在空中飞旋。杨培清望了望天，对王自新说：“是真心为人民服务，还是假意为人民服务，今晚就是个考验。咱们来个风雪大锻炼！”两人立刻戴上草帽，拄着木棍，顶着风雪出发了。他们根据病人的病情，先翻山越岭到东庄，为七十多岁的李德义老汉治疗了恶性疮疖引起的中毒症。接着他们就动身前往太阳嘴。太阳嘴是这一带最高的山峰。李德义的孙子李贵周劝阻道：“那是猴子走的路，天又黑雪又大，怎么能上去？还是住在我这儿吧。”他们说：“那里有病人等着，我们一定要去！”李贵周见他们执意要走，就扛起一把铁锨给他们带路。雨雪下个不停，路也辨不清，到太阳嘴山下时，王自新一看那陡峻的山峰，心里有点胆怯。杨培清鼓励他道：“你没看过革命战争的电影？解放军在执行战斗任务时，刀山火海也挡不住。这点困难算啥？上！”说着，就带头向上爬。天黑路又滑，他们便两手着地，边爬边摸，终于攀上了山顶。在为女社员朱玉英诊治了经痛和周身关节痛之后，又立即转向后山的徐家沟，为李茂林的老伴看病。这时，已经凌晨两点，他们敲开李茂林的门。老汉见他们浑身泥水已结成冰块，感动得连声说：“快进，快进！旧社会用马也接不来大夫，现在天都快亮了，你们还上门找病人。这真是世道变了！”杨培清说：“这是我们当医生应该做的工作，我们还做得不够。以后，要有病，捎个话，我们就来了。”在这里看完病，他们又奔向另一个地方，直到第二天太阳升在山顶，才结束风雪之夜的出诊。这一夜，他们没喝一口水，翻了五座山，过了六道沟，跑了四十多里路，到四个山庄给七个社员看了病。
    这种处处为群众着想，一切方便给病人的革命精神，还表现在医疗工作的其它方面。为了减轻群众看病的经济负担，他们常常为开一个处方反复斟酌，使开的药，既能治好病，又比较省钱，并且尽量用针灸、拔火罐等民间方法治疗。一九六四年，他们就给贫下中农免费针灸三百五十多人次。有的病人药未服完病已痊愈，还可以把余药退还找价。不论是对病人，还是陪送病人的家属，他们都热情地招待。要喝水，有开水；要煎药，有火盆、药锅。因天晚或重病回不去的，他们就让病人睡在自己的炕上。有一次，宁夏回族自治区固原县社员王武俊夫妇带小孩来卫生所看病，没有带吃的，也没有住处。王自新给他们做饭，给小孩煎药，让他们睡在自己的炕上。对于病人提出的问题，他们总是不厌其烦地回答。有的病人心情烦躁，态度不好，他们也毫不计较，还耐心地安慰，劝导。对一些年纪大的病人，他们开了药，都要三番五次地嘱咐怎么服用。
    为人民敢于挑重担
    青龙卫生所，先后治愈了四十多例危重病症，在六盘山区传为佳话。杨培清说：论技术我们很低，论条件我们很差，论药物我们很少，但贫下中农有了病，我们就有责任治疗。只要有高度为人民服务的精神和科学的态度，就能使技术和药物更好地发挥作用。
    一九六四年夏收季节的一天，官庄大队来家湾生产队的社员张生荣和杨占海，被火烧伤，伤势非常严重。对这样的烧伤，杨培清和王自新不但没有治过，连见也没有见过。按照这种情况，应该立即把病人送往县医院治疗。但是，来家湾距县城六十多里，山高坡陡，而且当时风雨交加，病人送不出去。
    怎么办呢？杨培清正在犹豫，只听得处于半昏迷状态的张生荣说：“我的伤不要紧，不必去城里。你们赶快去抢收麦子！”杨培清被张生荣这种高贵的品质深深感动了，决心就地想一切办法救活这两个阶级兄弟。公社党委也支持他们在当地抢救。
    怎么抢救？他们拿出《农村医士手册》，但是书上讲的植皮、输血、注射破伤风抗毒素等措施，在这里一样也办不到。杨培清说：“我们要尊重科学技术，但不能单纯迷信书本，死套框框。要是死搬硬套，只会感到没有办法。”他们最后决定：“西药不足，中药参战，洋的没有，土法上马。”
    首先碰到的难关是怎样防止感染。时值夏天，病人住在土窑洞，卫生条件很差。他们经过分析后认为，感染的可能性很大，但不是绝对不能避免的。没有无菌病房和药品，并不可怕，可怕的是消极等待和粗心大意。针对这个情况，他们提出：“严字当头”，用药物喷洒了窑洞、土炕、被褥，把衣物、用具进行了洗擦、蒸煮。每次换药之前，都用消毒药水把室内喷洒一遍，并把被褥放在日光下曝晒。终于闯过了这个难关。
    伤势较重的张生荣，第三天和第六天，连续两次处于昏迷状态，人事不省。防止休克，是两位医生面临的又一难关。当时，卫生所现有的二十二支葡萄糖和两千毫克抗坏血酸，已经全部用完了。大雨继续下着，到外地求援有困难。他们决定从中药上想办法。王自新经过反复考虑，给病人开了一服大剂量中药。病人服用后，果然生效，起了消炎、镇痛、抗休克的作用。接着，他们根据农村的经验，给病人饮用鸡汤、糖水、茶水、酸浆水和白菜汤，补充大量水分。
    在抢救过程中，最难办的是换药。每换一次药，给病人带来不少痛苦，他们感到十分不安。他们不嫌麻烦和劳累，采取轮流换药的办法，今天换这块，明天换那块，换一阵，停一阵，尽力减轻病人的痛苦。每换一次药，长达五六小时，有时腰弯得直不起来。杨培清一次劳累过度，在换药中昏倒过去。但是他始终保持着乐观的情绪和旺盛的斗志，从来没有说过累，没有叫过一声苦。结果，分别经过二十二天和三十几天时间，终于治愈了两个烧伤面积达百分之四十六点七和百分之二十三的病人。
    青龙卫生所抢救大面积烧伤病人胜利的消息，迅速传遍了六盘山周围，平凉专、县和驻军的许多医务工作者，跋山涉水前来访问。他们一致认为这是农村卫生战线上的一个创举。青龙卫生所三位医务工作者自己也作了总结，他们说：方向是毛主席给的，干劲是党委鼓的，腰是群众撑的，方法是大家想的。
    为革命练过硬技术
    怎么不断提高医疗技术，更好地为山区人民服务，是青龙卫生所三位青年医务人员经常考虑的问题。学西医的杨培清看到当地群众多爱看中医，就下定决心学习中医。他自修中医书刊，搜集民间方法，还到一百五十里外去向两位老中医请教。他反复读药性、汤头、病理、诊断等科目，将汤头歌贴在墙上，边学边用，边用边学。现在，他已经掌握了三十多个常用中药方和六十多个针灸穴位。学中医的王自新看到山区妇科病较多，每天起早贪晚在妇科方面钻研，现在已经熟记“妇科心法要诀”，并且积累了一些实践经验。只有高小程度的宋志明，原来既不认识药品、药材，更不知道药名、药性。他看到工作迫切需要他尽快地掌握这些知识，就下决心在学中干、干中学。西药，请教杨培清；中药，问王自新。就这样，经过两年的苦练，他不但熟记了各种中西药物，能够熟练地抓药、取药；而且学会了二百多种中药炮制方法，还掌握了注射、涂药等护理技术。
    他们认识到要从根本上减少疾病对群众的危害，就要坚决贯彻“预防为主”的方针，把疾病消灭在发生之前。因此，两年来，他们经常向群众宣传卫生和劳动保护知识，宣传预防疾病的办法，并且挨门逐户去注射防疫针剂。去年，他们又为各个生产大队培训了一批不脱离生产的卫生员和接生员，使群众看病更加便利了。
