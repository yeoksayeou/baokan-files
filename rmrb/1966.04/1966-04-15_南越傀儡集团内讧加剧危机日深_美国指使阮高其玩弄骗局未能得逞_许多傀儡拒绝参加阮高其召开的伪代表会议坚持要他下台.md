    Xinhua News Agency, 13th Dispatch from Saigon: Under the direction of its American masters, the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique staged a farce in Saigon on the 12th, convening a so-called "National Political Representative Conference." However, this deception played by the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique has neither eased the puppet infighting that has lasted for a month nor quelled the tide of anger among the masses.

    On the 12th, more than 17,000 people in cities such as Da Nang and Hue held large-scale demonstrations, demanding Nguyen Cao Ky's resignation and condemning the US support for Nguyen Cao Ky's puppet regime. They also put forward the slogans "Down with Nguyen Van Thieu, Nguyen Cao Ky, and Nguyen Huu Co."

    According to reports, US Ambassador to South Vietnam Lodge attended the pseudo-representative conference convened by the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky clique. However, the puppets in Da Nang, Hue, and other places announced their refusal to send "representatives" to participate. Out of the one hundred and ninety-one "representatives" invited, only ninety-two attended, and twenty walked out during the meeting. Puppets opposing Nguyen Cao Ky also established a "United Struggle Committee," demanding Nguyen Cao Ky's immediate resignation. The increasingly chaotic situation within the Saigon gang makes Nguyen Cao Ky's puppet government practically defunct; even the United Press International said, "Nguyen Cao Ky's military government is practically finished" and "doesn't have much longer to live."

    南越傀儡集团内讧加剧危机日深
    美国指使阮高其玩弄骗局未能得逞
    许多傀儡拒绝参加阮高其召开的伪代表会议坚持要他下台
    新华社十三日讯　西贡消息：南越傀儡阮文绍—阮高其集团在美国主子的导演下，十二日在西贡演出了召开所谓“全国政治代表大会”的丑剧。但是，阮文绍—阮高其集团玩弄的这个骗局，既未能缓和已经持续一月之久的傀儡内讧，也无法使广大群众的怒潮平息下来。
    十二日，岘港、顺化等城市一万七千多人举行了大规模的示威，要求阮高其下台，谴责美国支持阮高其的傀儡政权。并提出了“打倒阮文绍、阮高其、阮友固”的口号。
    据报道，美国驻南越“大使”洛奇参加了阮文绍—阮高其集团召开的伪代表会议。但是，岘港、顺化等地的傀儡宣布拒绝派“代表”参加。在被邀的一百九十一名“代表”中，仅九十二名出席，开会时又有二十名退席。反对阮高其的傀儡们还成立了“统一斗争委员会”，要求阮高其立即下台。西贡群丑内部越来越混乱的局面，使得阮高其的傀儡政府实际上已经名存实亡，连合众国际社也说，“阮高其的军政府实际上完蛋了”，“剩下的日子不长了”。（附图片）
