    Shenyang Manufactures New Type of Low-Temperature Thermometer
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang – A sensitive, accurate, and reliable low-temperature thermometer – a liquid metal glass low-temperature thermometer – has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory.
    Low temperatures can greatly change the properties of substances. For example, steel, after low-temperature treatment, can better stabilize its dimensions and improve its mechanical properties. With the continuous development of science and technology and industry in our country, laboratories using low-temperature conditions and industrial departments using low-temperature processes are increasing, and the requirements for low-temperature temperature-measuring elements are also getting higher and higher.
    There are many elements for measuring low temperatures, among which the glass liquid thermometer is relatively simple and economical. It uses the change in volume of the liquid inside the thermometer with temperature changes to measure temperature. In the past, these types of thermometers produced in our country used organic liquids such as alcohol and pentane as filling materials. Due to the large adhesion, a layer of organic liquid adhered to the wall of the thermometer tube when the temperature dropped, which affected the accuracy of use. The newly manufactured low-temperature thermometer uses a liquid metal alloy composed of low-melting-point metals such as mercury, thallium, and bismuth as the filling material, thereby overcoming this shortcoming. It can measure temperatures as low as minus sixty-two degrees Celsius, with a measurement error of no more than zero point two degrees.
    Only a few countries can currently manufacture liquid metal glass low-temperature thermometers. The staff of the Shenyang Glass Instrument Factory, with the help of the Shenyang Smelting Plant and relevant departments in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, spent a year and a half of repeated experiments to make the thermometer. Currently, the factory is preparing to further improve the measurement accuracy and extend the temperature measurement range of this thermometer in order to meet the needs of various scientific research units and industrial departments.

    沈阳制成新型低温温度计
    新华社沈阳电　反应灵敏、精确可靠的低温温度计——液体金属玻璃低温计，最近在沈阳玻璃计器厂试制成功。
    低温会使物质的性质发生很大的变化。譬如钢经过低温处理，可以更好地稳定它的尺寸，改善它的机械性能。随着我国科学技术和工业水平的不断发展，使用低温条件的实验室和低温工艺的工业部门日益增多，对低温的测温元件的要求也就越来越高。
    测量低温的元件很多，其中比较简单和经济的是玻璃液体温度计。它是利用温度计内的液体在温度变化时体积的改变来测量温度的。过去我国生产的这类温度计都是采用酒精、戊烷等有机液体作为充填物，由于附着力较大，当温度下降时温度计的管壁上沾附一层有机液体，这样会影响使用精度。新制成的低温温度计是采用汞、铊、铋等低熔点金属配成的液体金属合金作为充填物，从而克服了这一缺点。它最低可以测量零下六十二度的低温，测量误差不超过零点二度。
    液体金属玻璃低温计目前只有少数国家能够制造。沈阳玻璃计器厂职工是在沈阳冶炼厂和北京、上海等地有关部门的帮助下，经过一年半的反复试验才制成温度计的。目前这个厂正准备进一步提高这种温度计的测量精度和延伸测温范围，以便满足各个科学研究单位和工业部门的需要。
