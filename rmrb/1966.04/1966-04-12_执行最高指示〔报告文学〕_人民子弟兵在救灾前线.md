    Executing the Highest Instructions [Reportage]
    ——People’s Liberation Army on the Disaster Relief Front
    Li Qi
    One
    The telegraph key clicked urgently, transmitting news of a strong earthquake in some areas of Hebei Province, transmitting orders from the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao…
    As if hearing rapid gunfire, in the barracks, in the mess hall, people slammed down their bowls and chopsticks with a “clang,” those in bed leaped up, those in the club swarmed to the door… Seasoned veterans, new recruits in fresh uniforms, pilots in leather work clothes, white-coated soldiers with red cross bags, all clutched copies of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, stuffed their pockets with dry rations, and ran swiftly in the same direction.
    Veins bulging, arms were raised before the unit leaders; short, powerful letters of determination were handed to the political commissar.
    Combat teams were formed on the march; emergency Party branch and group meetings were held in the vehicles heading to the airport.
    Rumble, rumble! Cars set off, transport planes took off, helicopters ascended. Mao Zedong's warriors, the people's soldiers, sped into the disaster areas, and in the struggle against severe natural disasters, with deep class feelings and a spirit of "utter" and "complete" service to the people, composed heroic hymns of our great era.

    Two
    From the beginning, people raced against time, so the word "seize" became the overture to the hymn.
    The sky was pitch black. At Airport Number Five, the pilots felt as if the twinkling stars in the sky were reproaching them: "Why haven't you taken off yet?" Pairs of expectant eyes were fixed on the political commissar, as if saying: "Let us take off quickly!"
    The political commissar fully understood everyone's feelings; he was even more anxious than everyone else. According to information, by six o'clock this afternoon, only twelve hours after the earthquake, Airport Number Three near the disaster area was piled high with relief supplies: boxes of newly labeled medicines, bags of steaming hot steamed buns and pancakes, sanitary napkins for women, white sugar and milk powder for babies, Baoding mats, Shijiazhuang ginger, Eastern pots, Western ladles… In such a short time, the class brothers from all over thought of so many problems! Did so much work! What deep feelings! How he wanted to immediately say "fly," release these eagles, and swiftly send the Party's concern and the people's love into the hearts of the people in the disaster area! He carefully scrutinized each person with probing eyes, wanting to know how well his troops were prepared.
    Pairs of expectant eyes flashed with determination and confidence, as if saying: Comrade Political Commissar, please rest assured! Although we haven't flown at night for several months due to other tasks, and some comrades haven't had enough night flight training, and their skills haven't "passed the test," starting now will be more difficult than a blind person walking without a cane, but what does that matter! In the past, in the years of flying bullets and cannon fire, we still deeply remember the friendship of the military and civilians supporting each other in common combat; today, to rescue the class brothers affected by the disaster, we will not be afraid to climb mountains of knives or plunge into seas of fire.
    "We'll risk our lives to take off immediately!" Someone couldn't help but shout out what was in their hearts.
    "Risk our lives to take off immediately?" The political commissar quickly repeated the words, then said sternly: "Not enough—comrades! Just risking our lives to take off is far from enough." He pulled out *Quotations from Chairman Mao* at random, "At this time, how can we do if we only have the spirit to risk our lives and not be afraid of sacrifice? We must put more effort into the last nine words!"
    "Overcome all difficulties to win victory." Everyone also took out *Quotations from Chairman Mao*.
    "Right!" The political commissar said decisively, "We must take off tonight, and we must arrive safely!"
    Hearts were stirred even brighter. In a few short minutes, everyone made several plans to strive for rapid and safe arrival: fly in the direction guided by the railway beacons; fly guided by ground radar; fly according to normal night flight…
    The engine roared, the stars sped backwards, and the plane took off. Even they themselves did not expect that today's actions would be so rapid, with all flight preparation work taking only a quarter of the usual time.
    The plane moved forward along the railway, the pilots focusing intently on the characteristics of each beacon on the ground and the changes in each instrument in the cockpit. Their eyes ached from staring, sweat soaked their clothes, but the people in the same cabin still encouraged each other with their eyes: Persevere, observe carefully; remember, be sure to calculate accurately. They understood: careful observation and accurate calculation were directly proportional to the time being "seized," and directly proportional to "utter" and "complete."
    Suddenly, a world of lights appeared ahead, and the regular beacons indicating the direction of flight were submerged. The pilots' hearts tightened immediately. At this time, getting lost and delaying time would mean what! But they immediately reminded themselves: be calm, be composed. Rumble, rumble, the throttle that had just been reduced was immediately increased again, and they finally discovered that the lights were all flowing in one direction, and it could be determined that they were all heading to the disaster area. Was this not the best beacon to indicate the direction?
    How much sweat they shed, how many difficulties they overcame, the planes finally arrived at Airport Number Three in batches as required.
    From this time on, the pilots became even more demanding of time, dividing each second into several equal parts and putting them to several uses. As soon as the plane flew over the airport, the pilots requested tasks. As soon as the plane landed, the car had already driven to the side of the plane to pick up the pilots to receive tasks at the command post. Unexpectedly, Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Hongpeng got off the plane, took off his flying boots weighing several pounds, threw them beside the plane, put on a pair of cloth shoes he brought with him, and ran straight to the command post without getting into the car. The car driver, not understanding what was happening, quickly turned around to chase after him, but as soon as he reached the entrance of the command post, Xu Hongpeng had already come out of the command post and ran to where the plane was parked. When the car driver turned the car around again and chased to the side of the plane, Xu Hongpeng had already changed into his flying boots, stepped into the cockpit, and the plane's rotor began to turn. At this time, the driver suddenly realized: he was racing against time!
    Under the spur of the spirit of "utter" and "complete" service to the people, the troops won time, but difficulties still followed one after another.
    After the Zhang Quanlong crew received the task of transporting seriously injured people from Village Number Five, they quickly opened the map to prepare to draw the flight route, but after searching several times, Village Number Five was not on the map. Flying to such a small village was a big problem, but they were not intimidated. They had already experienced similar problems this morning. The members of this crew were all young people in their twenties, and their first set of flight suits were still brand new. It was the first time in their lives to perform such an urgent task. But early in the morning, just as they were about to take off, the earth was covered with thick fog. They relied on their high concern for the people in the disaster area and the wisdom of the collective to break through the obstruction of the heavy fog and arrived safely at their destination. Now Zhang Quanlong slammed the map shut and suddenly stood up, saying, "The injured are the sound of gunfire. Wherever there are injured, we will resolutely rush to them; even if the village is not on the map, we will definitely find it." The other comrades of the crew immediately responded, saying, "No matter how many difficulties there are, even if it's just one household, we will find it."
    They quickly asked people familiar with Village Number Five for information about its location and geographical features, learning that it was two kilometers south of Village Number Four, there was a river west of the village, with two small wooden bridges over the river, and there was an old kiln north of the village. After all the information was gathered, they immediately boarded the plane, with some calculating various flight data and others preparing to start the plane… completing work that usually took several hours in a few minutes.
    Village Number Four was quickly found, and there was indeed a village to its south, and there was indeed a river west of the village, with two small wooden bridges over the river, but they did not land, because the most important sign: the old kiln north of the village was not found. In the air, a river was just a thin strip, and a kiln was only as big as a small chess piece, so finding it was so difficult. In order to find it quickly, the pilot "swished" and lowered the altitude from three hundred meters to one hundred and fifty meters. "Kiln!" The people on the plane shouted almost simultaneously. Village Number Five was found.
    The plane landed at the entrance of Village Number Five, but unexpectedly, the injured had already been sent to Area Number Nine by the medical team in a car. The Zhang Quanlong crew immediately held a temporary group meeting to discuss whether to return with an empty plane or find a way to find Area Number Nine and bring the injured back. "We must find the injured!" After research, the whole group unanimously made a decision. Rumble, rumble, the plane got the approval of the command post and flew to Area Number Nine.
    In order to rescue class brothers, the soldiers tried every means to break through all kinds of difficulties and flew all over every corner of the disaster area. The places where cars had not been, the planes went in, the villages that were difficult to find even by bicycle, the planes found. Wherever there were seriously injured people, there were traces of airplane tires.

    Three
    While breaking through various difficulties on the transportation line to "seize" time, the medical teams that directly entered the villages were also realizing their determination to serve the people "utterly" and "completely" in the word "rescue."
    It was the third watch of the night [midnight to 2 AM], and the lights were still on in the tent of the "battlefield hospital," and rescue work was proceeding intensely. Military doctor Zhang Xizhen had just diagnosed several wounded and began to treat another wounded, poor peasant commune member Duan Jinsui, when Duan Jinsui suddenly burst into tears.
    "Does it hurt?" Zhang Xizhen quickly stopped her hand and asked with concern.
    "No," Duan Jinsui shook her head, "With you here, I wouldn't be afraid even if the sky fell. I'm just heartbroken! Look at you, you've stayed up all night to treat our commune members…"
    Zhang Xizhen and the others' eyes were indeed bloodshot, but they didn't feel it at all themselves, their hearts had long been closely linked with the hearts of the people in the disaster area. The day before yesterday, it was the "March 8th" [International Women's Day], and on their way to see a movie on their day off, they heard the news and immediately rushed back to the hospital as if flying, acting completely according to peacetime combat training. The equipment warehouse storing combat readiness materials was opened, and the medicines and equipment needed for battlefield rescue were taken out, and combat teams were formed one by one. They rushed to the village with mud on their feet, not eating dry food, not wiping sweat, and plunged into the commune members, conducting door-to-door condolences, investigations, and rescues. When they found that some commune members were seriously injured and needed surgery, they immediately set up tents and opened a "battlefield hospital." Work had been going on intensely for two days, and none of them had closed their eyes. How could their eyes not be bloodshot! But they had no fatigue. At this time, Zhang Xizhen smiled and said to Duan Jinsui:
    "Don't worry, our bodies are strong." As she spoke, she took a "bedpan" made of cardboard to Duan Jinsui's bedside. Due to a fractured pelvis, Duan Jinsui couldn't urinate or defecate, and her belly was already very swollen. When she saw Zhang Xizhen was going to help her with urination and defecation, she pushed Zhang Xizhen away, "I already feel bad enough for you treating my injuries, I can't trouble you with this." In fact, Duan Jinsui didn't understand that in this rescue, it was very common for medical personnel to help the wounded urinate and defecate. In order to save the masses, some people used their mouths to perform artificial respiration on the wounded, and some people used their mouths to suck the pus out of the wounded's wounds.
    "As long as we can get you out of danger, as long as we can relieve your pain, we are willing to do anything and do it any way," Zhang Xizhen explained in this way when she saw Duan Jinsui didn't want her to do it. Duan Jinsui didn't speak, just held Zhang Xizhen's hand tightly.
    Duan Jinsui's urine was discharged with the help of Zhang Xizhen and the others, but due to her serious injuries, she still couldn't defecate. At this time, Zhang Xizhen said nothing and stretched out her own fingers to dig out Duan Jinsui's stool. Duan Jinsui was so grateful that she bit her lip tightly and didn't speak for a long time. In the old society, poor people had to pour manure and urine for landlords in order to survive; today, the People's Liberation Army pours urine and touches manure for commune members. What is it for!
    "We are all class sisters, if you have any discomfort, just say it," Zhang Xizhen's kind words rang in Duan Jinsui's ears again, and Duan Jinsui shed tears again. People's Liberation Army, you are really the closest relatives!
    In order to rescue class brothers and sisters, the soldiers were not afraid of fatigue, not afraid of dirt, and disregarded their own lives to rescue commune members. While the rescue work was still in full swing, nurse Zhang Xiufen, a young female soldier, accepted the task of fetching medicine from a village more than ten miles away. As she was running forward through the quiet fields along the winding path, she couldn't help but exclaim "Ah!" She saw a child about ten years old had fallen into the mud that had spewed out during the earthquake. The mud had already reached his chest, and the child was struggling desperately. Zhang Xiufen realized that a slight hesitation would mean that the child would be in danger of being completely buried. She immediately ran over quickly, took off her cotton coat and threw it on the side of the road, and found a place where she could stand firmly, reached out to pull the child up, but couldn't reach him. She immediately untied her belt, holding one end herself and throwing the other end to the child.
    Zhang Xiufen pulled hard, pulling, already sweating like rain and feeling weak all over, but because the child was sunk too deep, she still couldn't pull him up. For the first time in her life, Zhang Xiufen began to complain about herself, why was she a woman? Why wasn't her body taller and bigger? As her strength increased, her own feet gradually sank. "What if I am completely buried in the mud?" A serious question was posed to Zhang Xiufen. At this moment, the virtues of Zhang Side and Bethune, and the spirit of Lei Feng and Wang Jie quickly appeared in her mind. So, she resolutely issued an order to herself: "I must save the child. If I am buried in the mud, I have to hold the child up!"
    Zhang Xiufen continued to pull, pull, the child's upper body was exposed more and more, Zhang Xiufen's feet sank deeper and deeper, and Zhang Xiufen felt more and more strenuous…
    She didn't know how long it took, but a middle-aged man happened to pass by. When he saw this scene, he immediately ran forward and pulled Zhang Xiufen and the child up together.
    The child was rescued, covered in mud, and the cold wind blew, freezing his lips purple. Zhang Xiufen, like a sister to her younger brother, helped the child take off his mud-covered clothes, and then put her own cotton coat on the child, carried him on her back, walked more than three miles, and sent the child to his home. The child's grandfather took the child and grabbed Zhang Xiufen's hand and asked:
    "Good girl, tell me, what's your name? I will definitely make you famous, so that Chairman Mao will be happy when he hears it." Zhang Xiufen replied readily: "I am a People's Liberation Army soldier who came here to provide disaster relief." She then ran as if flying to the village where she was going to get medicine.
    This spirit of the soldiers of "utterly" and "completely" serving the people not only enabled the injured commune members to avoid or reduce their injuries and pains, and escape danger, but also ensured the safe birth of many babies who were born at this time. After entering the village, the medical personnel of a certain hospital organized people to investigate the number and delivery dates of pregnant women, and prepared all the supplies needed for pregnant women and babies. In order to thank the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army for their spirit of completely and thoroughly serving the people, and to praise this era, they named their newborn babies "Nian Dang" [Remember the Party], "Nian Jun" [Remember the Army], "Ai Dang" [Love the Party], "Ai Jun" [Love the Army]…

    Four
    While "seizing" and "rescuing," the soldiers did not forget to "help."
    Just as the rescue work was gaining initial victory, suddenly, at night, a strong wind blew, and the humid air heralded that it was going to rain. At this time, the soldiers, exhausted and about to open their backpacks for a short rest, jumped up as if they had been electrocuted, and rushed to the commune members' homes with flashlights. Due to the strong earthquake, some houses collapsed and some houses cracked. While rescuing the wounded, the soldiers had already helped the commune members to build shelters. Now, were these shelters drafty? Did they leak? When soldier Zhang Kelin thought of these things, he rushed to the commune members' residences like everyone else. The sky was pitch black; the road was rugged and uneven. He walked forward with one foot high and one foot low. Just as he was about to press the flashlight, he immediately retracted his thumb preparing to press the button. There was not much electricity in the flashlight. He would rather fall a few more times than save the electricity for checking the shelters.
    As soon as he walked to a shelter, a voice immediately came from the shelter: "Who is it?" Before he had time to answer, his sleeve was grabbed by a hand. "Come in and avoid the wind." It was the hand of poor peasant Uncle Liu.
    Zhang Kelin walked into the shelter, turned on the flashlight, and shone it around the shelter. He found a small vent and immediately went out to find sorghum stalks to block it. A gust of wind blew in from the door, and he touched what Uncle Liu was spreading and covering, and immediately took off his coat and draped it over Uncle Liu. Before he could step out the door, his hand was grabbed by Uncle Liu:
    "Comrade, what kind of reasoning is this? How can you not care about yourself at all."
    "Uncle, Chairman Mao taught us to do this," Zhang Kelin said, breaking free from his hand, and disappeared into the windy night.
    Uncle Liu chased out with the coat, only to see the lights of flashlights all over the village. It turned out that the soldiers had all come to check the shelters, and they had all taken off their coats to put on the commune members. The commune members were not willing to depend, and asked the soldiers one by one: "Is this coat yours!" The soldiers all shook their heads and walked past. Uncle Liu chased and shouted: "Comrades! Chairman Mao told you to care for us, and also told us to care for you!" But the shouts were drowned out by the irregular footsteps of the soldiers checking the shelters.
    The wind blew tighter and tighter, and the soldiers' footsteps became denser and denser. They considered not only the immediate warmth and cold of the commune members, but also future production. Squad leader Dun Shutang found that the production team still had some grain seeds buried in the collapsed houses, and led several soldiers in his squad to rush to the scene like an attack and launch a surprise attack. The grain was stored in a reed mat bin, which was covered with thick soil. Just as a soldier was about to use a three-pronged rake to dig the soil, he was immediately stopped by the squad leader. The soldier did not understand and said: "It's going to rain, why don't you hurry…"
    "We have to be fast, but we can't let a single seed leak out," the squad leader snatched the three-pronged rake from the soldier's hand and took the lead in digging with his hands. The soldiers had nothing to say, and immediately followed the squad leader's example and quickly dug the soil with their hands.
    Bags of millet, mung beans, and sorghum seeds were dug out. The soldiers' hands had been scratched with cuts, and some even had their fingernails pulled off. These were no ordinary seeds! They were clearly the red seeds of the troops' love for the people.

    Five
    In the tense battle, the soldiers cared about the people's pain and itching, and were considerate of the people's warmth, cold, hunger, and satiety, and indeed reached the degree of "utter" and "complete." However, the most "utter" and most "complete" was that they not only acted according to the highest instructions in every move, but also never forgot to publicize Mao Zedong Thought to the masses of people every minute and every second.
    With the roar of engines, helicopters landed at the commune members' doorsteps, and the village immediately boiled over. Commune members, regardless of men, women, old, or young, forgot the pain on their bodies, quickly surrounded the troops, surrounded the planes, tightly held the soldiers' hands, and affectionately stroked the body of the planes. They didn't know what to do, they didn't know what to say. Some old commune members, at first, couldn't believe the facts in front of them, "How can there really be heavenly bodhisattvas in the world?"
    "You are…"
    "We are the People's Liberation Army sent by Chairman Mao to provide disaster relief."
    Ah! Chairman Mao has sent troops again. Pairs of hands trembled, regardless of men, women, old, or young, everyone was in tears; regardless of men, women, old, or young, they shouted enthusiastically: "Long live the Communist Party!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" The cheers contained so much gratitude, so many grateful words: Chairman Mao, in the past, it was you who sent troops to rescue us from the butcher knives of the Japanese devils; then, it was you who sent troops to rescue us from the guns of the Kuomintang; in 1963, when there was a big flood, it was you who sent planes to rescue us; today, the sky is still shaking and the ground is still shaking, and you have sent "divine soldiers and generals" to us so quickly. The Japanese devils and the Kuomintang sent planes to kill us, but you have sent planes time and time again to save us. It's really a thousand times better, a million times better, there is nothing better than socialism; father is dear, mother is dear, but no one is dearer than the Communist Party and Chairman Mao!
    Looking at the huge rotor of the helicopter and listening to the huge roar of the engine, how many questions were on the minds of the commune members! When they heard that the people flying the planes were all ordinary workers and peasants, and some had herded cattle under the landlords' whips, and when they heard that there was not a single screw from imperialism or a single wire from revisionism on these planes, and they were completely made by our own country, their hearts churned even more.
    The soldiers had long been infected by the enthusiastic scene. They shared the same experiences and the same feelings as the people here, but they had never forgotten their current task. In the crowd, the soldiers told everyone with passion that all of this was because of Chairman Mao and because they did what Chairman Mao said. Red-covered copies of *Quotations from Chairman Mao* were taken out. Groups of people gathered around. "Does this contain Chairman Mao's words? Read them to everyone quickly!" "Comrade Liberation Army, please raise your voice, slow down your speed, and pronounce your words clearly, so that we can carefully listen to what he wrote himself, what should we do now!"…
    In an instant, the "red treasure books" were opened everywhere in the disaster area. On the construction site of shelters, in the green tents, next to the planes, in the cars, everywhere you could see the soldiers reading and explaining *Quotations from Chairman Mao* to the commune members.
    The soldiers read and spoke with all their feelings, and the commune members listened and thought with all their attention. There were so many words and the meaning was so long. The soldiers didn't know how many times they had read it and how many times they had spoken it, but the commune members still felt unsatisfied. Faced with this situation, the soldiers took up pens and ink again and worked hard overnight to write Chairman Mao's quotations, word by word, sentence by sentence, on paper, and then posted them in the shelters and on the broken walls. Wherever the commune members went, they could see Chairman Mao's admonition: "Our comrades must see the achievements, see the light, and increase our courage in times of difficulty." "Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every difficulty to win victory." From white-haired old people to innocent children, concepts such as "revolution," "struggle," "class," and "self-reliance" were deeply imprinted in their minds.
    Listening to Chairman Mao's words, the commune members' hearts yearned for Chairman Mao even more. The nine-year-old daughter of a poor peasant, Ma Pingguo, shouted, "Mom, my Chairman Mao picture, my Chairman Mao picture!" when she was injured in the leg and sent to the plane. The soldiers deeply understood the feelings of the commune members, and took out their money to buy Chairman Mao's pictures and send them to the commune members' homes. The commune members took the pictures of Chairman Mao and pasted them in the most conspicuous and sheltered places. The old people taught their children over and over again in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: When you grow up, you must record this matter in the book, so that your children and grandchildren will know when and how you suffered the disaster, and how Chairman Mao sent troops to save us.
    So many quotations from Chairman Mao, so many pictures of Chairman Mao, gave the commune members so much fighting strength. In a production team close to the epicenter of the earthquake, on the third day after the disaster, a large pile of fresh manure appeared in the collective manure field; by the seventh day, most of the labor force was hoeing the fields, and almost at the same time, the schools were filled with the children's loud reading and happy singing.
    The soldiers were deeply moved. Mao Zedong Thought was so easily accepted by the masses of people, and once Mao Zedong Thought was accepted by the masses of people, it could produce such a huge force! The soldiers and the masses were even more convinced of this truth: the best weapon is Mao Zedong Thought, and the greatest fighting power is people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. The people's determination to defeat the enemy was even greater, and their confidence was even stronger: we are not afraid of the collapse of heaven and earth, and the imperialists in the world are definitely not our opponents.

专栏：

    执行最高指示〔报告文学〕
    ——人民子弟兵在救灾前线李琦
    一
    电键紧促地跳动着，电波传着河北省一些地区发生强烈地震的消息，传着党中央毛主席的命令……    象是听到紧促的枪声，军营中，饭堂里的人“当郎”一声把碗筷撂下了，被窝里的人腾地蹦了出来，俱乐部里的人嗡地拥向了门口……身经百战的指挥员，刚穿上军装的新战士，身着皮工作服的飞行员，肩挎红十字包的白衣战士，都揣一本《毛主席语录》，塞一口袋干粮，向同一个方向迅跑。
    一只只青筋绷起的胳臂在部队首长面前举起，一份份简短有力的决心书交到了政委手里。
    行军的路上组编起一个个战斗小组；开往机场的汽车上召开着紧急的党的支委会、小组会。
    轰隆隆！汽车出动了，运输机起航了，直升飞机起飞了，毛泽东的战士，人民的子弟兵，飞速地开进了受灾地区，在和严重的自然灾害斗争中，以深厚的阶级感情，“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神，谱写起我们伟大时代的英雄的赞歌。
    二
    一开始，人们就和时间较量上了，所以“抢”字，就成了赞歌的序曲。
    天，漆黑。五号机场上，飞行员们都觉得天上闪闪烁烁的星星，象是在责备自己：“你们怎么还不起飞？”一双双期待的眼睛都紧紧地盯在政委的身上，好象在说：“快让我们起飞吧！”
    政委完全了解大家的心情，他的心比大家更急。据了解，今天下午六点，即地震发生后才十二个小时，灾区附近的三号机场上，就堆满了救灾物资：一箱箱新签上品名的药品，一袋袋冒着热气的馒头、大饼，妇女用的卫生纸，婴儿用的白糖、代乳粉，保定的席，石家庄的姜，东方的锅，西方的瓢，……这么短促的时间，各地的阶级弟兄，想到了多少问题！做了多少工作！何等深厚的感情呀！他多么想马上说个“飞”字，放出这批雄鹰，将党的关怀、人民的爱，飞速送到灾区人民心里啊！他用探索的目光细细地打量着每一个人，他要知道自己的部队准备的情况。
    一双双期待的眼睛闪出坚决、自信的神情，好象在说：政委同志，请放心！虽然我们因为执行别的任务，已有好几个月没有夜航了，加上有的同志原来夜航课目就没有训练够，技术没有“过关”，现在出发，困难会比盲人放下拐棍走路还大，但那又有什么关系！过去，在炮火纷飞的年月里，军民互相支援共同战斗的友情，我们都还深深地记在心里，今天，为了抢救受灾的阶级兄弟，上刀山、下火海我们都将毫不畏惧。
    “我们豁出命来也得马上起飞！”不知是谁忍不住把心里的话喊出来了。
    “豁出命来也得马上起飞？”政委迅速地把话重复了一句，接着严肃地说：“不够——同志们！光是豁出命来起飞是远远不够的。”他随手掏出了《毛主席语录》，“在这个时候，我们光有敢豁出命来不怕牺牲的精神怎么能行呢？我们必须在后面九个字上多下功夫！”
    “排除万难，去争取胜利。”大家也都把《毛主席语录》拿了出来。
    “对！”政委斩钉截铁地说，“今晚一定要起飞，而且一定要平安到达！”
    一颗颗心被拨得更亮了。短短的几分钟里，大家就作出了几套争取迅速、平安到达的方案：顺着铁路灯标指引的方向飞行；由地面雷达引导飞行；按正常夜航飞行……
    马达一声怒吼，星星迅速往后飞奔，飞机出航了。连他们自己也都没有想到，今天的动作会如此迅速，全部飞行准备工作，仅仅花了平时四分之一的时间。
    飞机沿着铁路前进着，飞行员们全神贯注地注视着地面每个灯标的特点，和座舱里每个仪表的变化。眼睛盯得发痛了，汗水把衣衫湿透了，同一个机舱里的人仍然用目光互相鼓励着：坚持，仔细观察；记住，一定算准。他们明白：观察的细致，计算的准确，是和正在“抢”着的时间成正比的，是和“完全”“彻底”成正比的。
    突然，前面出现了一个灯火的世界，指示飞行方向的规则的灯标被淹没了，飞行员的心立即绷紧了，在这时候，要是迷航，贻误时间，那是意味着什么呵！但他们立即提醒自己：要冷静，要沉着。轰隆隆，刚降下的油门马上又加大了，他们终于发现那灯火是向一个方向流动的，可以断定都是奔往灾区的，这不正是指示方向的最好的灯标吗？
    不知流了多少汗，不知克服了多少困难，飞机终于按要求一批批到达了三号机场。
    从这时候起，飞行员们对时间更加苛刻了，一秒钟也要划好几个等份，派好几个用场。飞机刚刚飞临机场上空，飞行员们就请示任务了。飞机一落地，汽车已开到了飞机旁，准备接飞行员去指挥所领受任务，不料副参谋长徐鸿鹏，下了飞机，脱下几斤重的飞行靴，往飞机旁一甩，蹬上随身带的一双小布鞋，不上汽车，径直就往指挥所跑去。汽车司机没有弄清是怎么回事，连忙掉过头追上去，可他刚到指挥所门口，徐鸿鹏已经从指挥所出来往飞机停放的地方奔去。等汽车司机又掉过车头追到飞机旁边时，徐鸿鹏已经换上飞行靴，跨进了座舱，飞机的旋翼也开始转动了。这时司机才恍然大悟：他是在和时间赛跑啊！
    部队在“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神的鞭策下，赢得了时间，但困难仍接踵而至。
    张泉龙机组接到去五号村庄运载重伤员的任务之后，就迅速打开地图，准备绘航线，哪知找了几遍，地图上就是没有五号村。要飞达这样的小村，是个大难题，但他们没有被吓倒，象这样的难题，上午他们已经经历过了。这个机组的人员，都是二十来岁的青年人，第一套飞行服都还是崭新的，执行这样紧急的任务，生平还是第一次。可早晨，偏偏在他们出航的时候，大地被浓雾盖得严严实实的，他们凭着对灾区人民的高度关切，凭着集体的智慧，冲破了重雾的阻挡，平安地到达了目的地。现在张泉龙又把地图啪地一合，忽地站了起来，说：“伤员就是枪声，哪里有伤员，我们坚决奔往哪里；地图上没有的村庄，我们也一定要找到。”机组其他同志立刻响应，说：“不管有多少困难，哪怕是一户人家，我们也要找到。”
    他们迅速向熟悉五号村的人了解位置和地理特点，得知它在四号村以南两公里的地方，村西有条河，河上有两座小木桥，村北有座旧窑。一切资料找好之后，他们马上登上飞机，有人计算各种飞行所需的数据，有人作开车准备工作，……把平时几个小时的工作压缩到几分钟之内做完。
    四号村很快地找到了，它南面的确有个村庄，村西确实有条河，河上有两座小木桥，但他们没有降落，因为最重要的标帜：村北的旧窑没有发觉。在空中看来，河流不过是一条细带，一座窑就只有一颗小棋子那么大，要找到它，是多么不容易。为了迅速找到，飞行员“刷”地把高度由三百米降到了一百五十米。“窑！”机上的人几乎是同时高喊了一声。五号村找到了。
    飞机在五号村口落地了，不想这时伤员已被医疗队用汽车送往九号地区了。张泉龙机组立即开了个临时小组会，研究是空着飞机回去呢，还是设法找到九号地区，拉上伤员回去？“一定要找到伤员！”研究结果，全组一致下了决心。轰隆隆，飞机得到指挥所的批准，又向九号地区飞去。
    为了抢救阶级弟兄，子弟兵就这样千方百计，冲破了种种困难，飞遍了灾区的每个角落。汽车没有到过的地方，飞机进去了，骑自行车都不易找到的村庄，飞机找到了。哪里有重伤员，哪里就留有飞机轮胎的痕迹。
    三
    在运输线上冲破种种困难“抢”时间的同时，直接进入村子的医疗队也在“救”字上实现着自己“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的决心。
    三更时分了，“战地医院”的帐篷里还亮着灯，救护工作正紧张地进行着。军医张希真刚诊断了几名伤员，开始给另一名伤员、贫农社员段金绥进行治疗，段金绥突然热泪突眶而出。
    “疼啦？”张希真连忙停住手，关心地问。
    “不，”段金绥摆了摆头，“有您们在，我自己是天塌下来也不怕了。我是心疼啊！看你们，为了给我们社员治伤，眼都熬红了……”
    张希真她们的眼睛是熬红了，但她们自己根本都没有感觉到，她们的心早已和灾区人民的心紧紧地连在一起了。前天，正是“三八”节，她们放假去看电影的路上，听到了这个消息，立即飞也似地奔回医院，完全按平时战斗训练行动，存放战备物资的器材仓库打开了，战地抢救所需的药品、器械拿出来了，一个个战斗小组编起来了。她们一脚泥一脚水赶到了村里，干粮没有吃，汗水没有擦，就一头扎到社员群众之中，挨门挨户进行慰问、调查、抢救，发现有的社员伤势比较严重，需要动手术，就立即搭起了帐篷，开起了“战地医院”。工作已经紧张地进行了两天了，她们谁也没有合过眼，眼睛怎么能不熬红呵！但她们都没有倦意。这时张希真笑了笑，对段金绥说：
    “放心，我们的身体硬朗着呢。”说着就把一个硬纸做的“便盆”拿到段金绥的床前。段金绥由于骨盆骨折，解不出大、小便，肚子已经鼓得很大，她见张希真要帮她排大小便，一把就把张希真推开了：“叫您们给治伤，俺已过意不去了，这个，说啥俺也不能麻烦您们了。”其实，段金绥不了解，在这次救护中，医务人员帮助伤员排大、小便是极平常的事。为了救群众，有的人用嘴对伤员进行人工呼吸，有的人用嘴吸出伤员伤口的脓。
    “只要能使你们脱险，只要能解除你们身上的痛苦，我们干什么、怎么干，都心甘情愿。”张希真见段金绥不依，就这样解释。段金绥不说话了，只是紧紧地拉住张希真的手。
    段金绥的小便在张希真她们帮助下排出来了，但由于伤势过重，大便还是解不出来。这时张希真二话没说，就伸出自己的手指，为段金绥抠出了大便。段金绥感激得紧紧地咬着嘴唇，好久没有说话。旧社会，穷人为了活命，不得不给地主倒屎倒尿；今天，解放军为公社社员倒尿摸屎，是为了什么呀！
    “咱们都是阶级姐妹，你有什么不舒服的地方尽管说。”张希真亲切的话又在段金绥耳边响起，段金绥又落泪了。解放军哪，您们真是最亲的亲人啊！
    为了抢救阶级兄弟姐妹，子弟兵不怕疲劳，不怕脏，不顾自己生命的危险，抢救社员群众。抢救工作还在紧张进行着的时候，护士张秀芬，一位年轻的女战士，接受了去十几里路外的村庄取药的任务。她正穿过僻静的田野顺着弯弯曲曲的小道往前奔跑着，突然，禁不住“啊”地惊叫了一声，只见前面一个十来岁的小孩掉进了地震时喷出的泥浆里去了。泥浆已经埋到胸口，小孩正使劲地挣扎着。张秀芬意识到，稍一迟疑，孩子将有全部陷进去的危险。当即飞速奔了过去，脱下棉衣往路边一甩，就找一个能经住脚站的地方站稳，伸手想拉上孩子，但够不着。她又马上解下自己的腰带，自己拿着一头，另一头丢给小孩。
    张秀芬使劲地拉着，拉着，已经汗水如雨，浑身无力，但由于小孩陷得过深，还是没能拉上来。张秀芬生平第一次埋怨开自己，为什么自己是个女的？为什么自己的身体不长高大一些？随着她用力的增大，她自己的脚也渐渐地陷下去了。“要是我自己也完全陷进去怎么办？”一个严重的问题向张秀芬提出来了。也就在这个时候，张思德、白求恩的品德，雷锋、王杰的精神迅速在她脑海里出现。于是，她毅然决然地给自己下了一道命令：“一定要把孩子救上来。如果自己被泥浆埋了，托也得把小孩子托起来！”
    张秀芬继续拉呀，拉呀，小孩的上身越露越多，张秀芬的双脚却越陷越深，张秀芬感到越来越吃力了。……
    不知过了多长时间，碰巧过来一个过路的中年男人，他一见这种情景，当即奔上前去，把张秀芬俩一起拉了上来。
    孩子被救上来了，浑身都是泥浆，冷风嗖嗖地吹来，冻得他嘴唇发紫了。张秀芬象姐姐对弟弟那样，帮小孩脱下了沾满泥浆的衣服，然后又将自己的棉衣让小孩穿上，背上他，走了三里多路，把小孩送到他家里。小孩的爷爷接过孩子，一把拉住张秀芬的手问：
    “好闺女，告诉我，你叫什么名？我一定给你扬名，让毛主席他老人家听了，也高兴高兴。”张秀芬爽快地答了一句：“我是来这里救灾的解放军。”便飞也似地往她取药的村庄奔去。
    子弟兵这种“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务的精神，不仅使受伤的社员们免除或减轻了伤痛，解脱了危险，而且使许多在这个时候降生的婴儿也平安出世。某医院的医护人员，进村之后，在抢救伤员的同时，就组织人员调查孕妇的数字和生产日期，为孕妇和婴儿准备好生产所需的一切物资。群众为了感谢共产党，感谢解放军完全、彻底为人民服务的精神，歌颂这个时代，分别将自己的新生婴儿，起名“念党”、“念军”、“爱党”、“爱军”……。
    四
    在“抢”和“救”的同时，子弟兵也没有忘记“帮”。
    抢救工作正当获得初胜的时候，夜晚，天突然刮起了大风，湿润的空气，向人们预告，天要落雨了。这时忙得精疲力尽、正准备打开背包略为休息片刻的战士，又象触了电一般腾地跳了起来，纷纷拿着手电往社员家里奔去。由于强烈的地震，一些房子倒塌了，一些房子震裂了。子弟兵在抢救伤员的同时，已经帮助社员修搭起了窝棚。现在这些窝棚是不是透风？漏不漏雨呢？战士张克林想到这些，和大家一样，抢着往社员住处奔跑。天，漆黑；路，坎坷不平，他高一脚低一脚往前走着，正想按手电，立即又把准备按电钮的大拇指缩了回来，手电里的电不多了，宁可自己多摔上几跤，也要将电留着检查窝棚用。
    他刚走到一家窝棚旁边，窝棚里立即传来问声：“谁？”他还没有来得及回答，袖子已被一只手拉住，“快进来避避风。”这是贫农刘大爷的手。
    张克林走进窝棚，打开手电，把棚子四周照了一遍。发现有一个小风口，马上出去找来秫秸给堵好；一阵风从门口刮了进来，他摸了摸刘大爷铺的和盖的，马上脱下大衣，披到刘大爷的身上。脚还没迈出门口，手被刘大爷拉住了：
    “同志，你这行的是哪个理？怎能一点不顾自己。”
    “老大爷，这是毛主席教我们这样做的。”张克林说着，挣脱开手，便消失在风夜之中。
    刘大爷拿着大衣追了出来，只见满村都是手电的灯光。原来子弟兵都来检查窝棚了，他们的大衣全脱给社员群众穿了。社员群众哪里肯依，一个个追着子弟兵问：“这大衣是你的吧！”子弟兵都摇摇头走过去了。刘大爷边追边喊：“同志啊！毛主席叫你疼俺，也叫俺疼你呀！”可喊声被子弟兵检查窝棚时发出的一阵阵不规则的脚步声压下去了。
    风越刮越紧，子弟兵的脚步越来越密，他们既考虑到社员眼前的寒暖，更想到了以后的生产。班长敦树堂发现生产队还有一些粮食种子，埋在倒塌的房子里，就领着班里的几个战士，象进攻一样，冲到了现场，展开突击。粮食装在一个苇席的囤子里，囤子上埋着厚厚的土。一个战士刚刚用三齿去扒土，一把被班长拦住了。战士不解，说：“天要下雨了，还不快……”
    “要快，但也不能叫种子漏掉一粒。”班长夺下战士手里的三齿，自己就带头用手扒了起来。战士们没有二话，当即学班长的样，赶紧用手扒土。
    一袋袋谷子、绿豆、高粱种子被扒出来了，子弟兵的手已划出了一道道口子，有的连指甲也扒掉了。这哪是普通的种子啊！分明是部队热爱人民的红色种子。
    五
    紧张的战斗中，子弟兵关心人民的痛痒，体贴人民的寒暖饥饱，确实达到了“完全”“彻底”的程度，然而最“完全”最“彻底”的，还是他们不仅自己一举一动都按最高指示行动，而且分分秒秒都没有忘记向人民群众宣传毛泽东思想。
    随着阵阵马达的轰鸣，直升飞机落到了社员家门口，村庄立即沸腾起来了。社员不分男女老少，忘记自己身上的伤痛，迅速围住了部队，围住了飞机，紧紧地拉子弟兵的手，深情地抚摸飞机的机体。他们不知道该做什么，不知道该讲什么。个别年老的社员，起先真不敢相信眼前发生的事实，“怎么，世上真有天菩萨？”
    “您们是……”
    “我们是毛主席派来救灾的解放军。”
    啊！毛主席又派队伍来了。一双双手颤抖了起来，不分男女老少，个个热泪滚滚；不分男女老少，热烈高呼：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”欢呼声里，包含着多少感激之情，多少感激的话：毛主席啊毛主席，过去，是您老人家派队伍在日本鬼子的屠刀下救出了俺；接着，又是您老人家派队伍在国民党的枪口下救出了俺；一九六三年发大水，还是您派出了飞机搭救俺；今天，天还在摇，地还在晃，您老人家又那么神速给俺派来了“神兵天将”。日本鬼子、国民党派飞机是杀俺，您老人家一次一次派飞机尽是救俺。真是千好万好，没有社会主义好；爹亲娘亲，没有共产党、毛主席亲啊！
    看着直升飞机庞大的旋翼，听着马达巨大的轰鸣，社员群众心上想着多少问题呵！当他们听说开飞机的，全是普通的工人和贫下中农出身的，有的人在地主鞭子下放过牛，当他们听说，这飞机上上下下，没有帝国主义的一个螺钉，没有修正主义的一截电线，完完全全是我国自己制造的时候，心里更加翻腾不已了。
    子弟兵早已被热烈的场面感染，他们和这里的人们，有着共同的经历，共同的感情，但是他们一直没有忘记自己当前的任务。人群里，子弟兵满怀激情地告诉大家，这一切的一切，都是因为有了毛主席，都是因为照了毛主席说的话去做。一本本红皮的《毛主席语录》掏出来了。一群群人围拢来了。“这里面载着毛主席的话？快念给大伙儿听听吧！”“解放军同志，你把嗓门放大点，把速度放慢点，把口齿咬清点，让俺们细细听听他老人家亲笔写的话，眼下该怎么办吧！”……
    一刹间，“红皮宝书”纷纷在灾区的每个角落打开。搭窝棚的工地上，绿色的帐篷里，飞机旁，汽车上，到处可以看到子弟兵给社员群众念讲《毛主席语录》。
    子弟兵倾注自己全部的感情读着、讲着，社员群众全神贯注地听着、想着。话是这么多，意是这么长。子弟兵不知念了多少遍，讲了多少遍，但社员群众仍然感到不满足。面对这种情况，子弟兵又取过笔墨，连夜突击，把毛主席语录，一字字、一句句写到了纸上，然后在窝棚里、断墙上贴了起来。社员群众走到哪里，都可以看到毛主席这样的嘱咐：“我们的同志在困难的时候，要看到成绩，要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”从白发老人到天真的儿童，脑子里都深深地印上了“革命”“斗争”“阶级”“自力更生”等概念。
    听着毛主席的话，社员群众想念毛主席的心更切了，贫农的女儿九岁的马平国，在腿负伤送她上飞机的时候，还喊：“妈妈，我的毛主席像，我的毛主席像！”子弟兵深深地了解社员群众的心情，纷纷掏出了自己的钱，买上一张张毛主席像，送到社员家里。社员们接过了毛主席像，把像贴到了最显目又最避风的地方。老人们又对着毛主席像一遍又一遍地教孩子：你们长大了可一定得把这事载到书里，叫子子孙孙都知道，哪年哪月，怎么受的灾，毛主席怎么派队伍来救的俺。
    一条条毛主席语录，一张张毛主席像，给了社员群众多大的战斗的力量啊，在一个接近地震中心的生产队里，灾后的第三天，集体的粪场上，就出现了一大堆新鲜的粪；到第七天，绝大部分劳力都荷锄下地了，几乎是同时，学校里也有了孩子们琅琅的书声和快活的歌声。
    子弟兵深深地被感动了，毛泽东思想是这样容易被人民群众接受，毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众接受，竟能产生如此巨大的力量！子弟兵和群众都更加坚信这样的真理了：最好的武器是毛泽东思想，最大的战斗力是毛泽东思想武装起来的人。人们战胜敌人的决心更大了，信心更足了：天老爷山崩地裂我们都不怕，人间的帝国主义，也决不是我们的对手。
