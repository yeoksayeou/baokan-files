    Doing Business According to Socialist Management Thought or Capitalist Management Thought
    Winning a Battle of Promoting the Proletarian and Eliminating the Bourgeois at a Material Exchange Fair Emphasizing Politics
    The 1965 National Third Category Material Exchange Fair was held in Tianjin in December of that year. This kind of fair is for doing business, and if politics is not emphasized, it will foster a purely business-oriented viewpoint and capitalist management thought. This conference put politics in command and turned into a "promoting the proletarian and eliminating the bourgeois" meeting.
    At this exchange fair, the transaction volume of third-category materials increased by 42.5% compared to the previous session; however, there was still a considerable gap from the requisition amount proposed by each delegation. Under these circumstances, some people wanted to compete for "hot commodities" and "make a killing"; some people who had "hot commodities" in hand wanted to keep them back and were unwilling to easily release them. Therefore, whether this exchange fair could be successful and better support the country's production and construction depended on how to get everyone to offer more scarce goods on the one hand, and how to ensure that scarce goods were traded reasonably to meet urgent needs on the other. To achieve this, a struggle was needed: to handle affairs according to the communist style, or according to departmentalism? To do business according to capitalist management thought, or according to socialist management thought?
    The exchange fair's leading group initially required that this meeting be turned into a conference for creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and for transforming thinking. It clearly put forward that the meeting must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and must implement one principle (developing the economy, ensuring supply), two services (serving production, serving the people's livelihood), and three viewpoints (political viewpoint, production viewpoint, mass viewpoint). In the first six days of the meeting, everyone did not talk about business but focused on studying Chairman Mao's quotations on serving the people, the overall viewpoint, increasing production and practicing economy, etc. At that time, Wang Jie's diary had just been published, and the conference also seized the time to organize study. Each delegation established a Party branch, and the conference set up a Party committee office to closely carry out ideological and political work. Many delegations discussed ideological understanding issues such as calculating small accounts versus calculating big accounts, and why they were unwilling to supply more goods.
    The political atmosphere at the meeting became strong, capitalist management thought was criticized, and the socialist style of work was promoted, resulting in many gratifying phenomena.
    The meeting promoted the overall viewpoint. Many delegations increased the supply of "hot commodities" by tapping internal potential. The Heilongjiang delegation learned that many provinces needed miscellaneous wood poles in water conservancy construction, so they increased the supply from 15 million to 25 million. Shandong, Hunan, Yunnan, and other provinces also increased the supply of straw braid, miscellaneous wood, bamboo strips, and other materials. For some materials in short supply, each delegation put the supply and requisition plans on the table, negotiated democratically, and reasonably allocated them according to the principles of ensuring key points, taking care of general needs, and traditional relationships.
    The meeting promoted the communist style of seizing difficulties and providing convenience. For example, the Beijing delegation did not have enough machine wiping waste, so Tianjin and Shanghai took the initiative to increase the supply. The Inner Mongolia delegation was allocated 400 dan of tangerines, but later learned that Jilin Province needed them more for the Spring Festival market, so they took the initiative to give them to Jilin.
    Many delegations also re-examined the requisition plans in the spirit of self-reliance and supporting production. Some products that had local resources and could be produced locally, and some raw materials that could be replaced by other items, were determined to organize production locally and no longer requisition them from outside.
    As a result, in the later stage of the meeting, the supply plan exceeded the requisition plan; the relatively scarce commodities were also reasonably allocated, ensuring key needs. The needs of each delegation were basically met. Some "old business experts" once worried: "If I promote the style, but others don't, won't I suffer?" In the face of these facts, they also felt that their "old tricks" should be changed.
    The process of the exchange fair shows that to put politics in command, a struggle is necessary; to oppose capitalist management thought, a resolute attitude of struggle must be adopted. For example, during the meeting, some people were slow to release "hot commodities." The leading group, determined not to yield to capitalist management thought, did not intercede but conducted positive education to inspire awareness. Near the end of the exchange fair, the leading group learned that some delegations still had "hot commodities" that had not been released, and did not accommodate the capitalist management style, resolutely deciding to close on schedule. This attitude of adhering to socialist principles ensured that this exchange fair could emphasize politics from beginning to end, and laid a good foundation for further eliminating capitalist management thought in future exchange fairs.

    按社会主义经营思想做生意还是按资本主义经营思想做生意
    在一次突出政治的物资交流会上打了一个兴无灭资的胜仗
    一九六五年全国三类物资交流会当年十二月份在天津召开。这种会是做买卖的会，如果不突出政治，就会助长单纯业务观点和资本主义经营思想。这次会议政治挂了帅，开成了一次“兴无灭资”的大会。
    在这次交流会上，三类物资成交额，比上一届增加了百分之四十二点五；可是离各代表团提出的要货额，还有不小的差距。在这种情况下，有的人就想争“热货”，“捞一把”；有的人手里有“热货”，想先留一手，不肯轻易拿出来。因此，这次交流会能不能开好，能不能更好地支持国家的生产建设，关键在于如何一方面使大家多拿出缺货，一方面使缺货合理成交，保证急需。要做到这一点，就需要进行一场斗争：按共产主义风格办事，还是按本位主义办事？按资本主义经营思想做生意，还是按社会主义经营思想做生意？
    交流会领导小组一开始就要求把这次会开成活学活用毛主席著作的大会、改造思想的大会，明确提出，会议一定要用毛泽东思想挂帅，一定要贯彻一个方针（发展经济，保障供给）、两个服务（为生产服务，为人民生活服务）、三大观点（政治观点，生产观点，群众观点）。会议前六天，大家不谈生意，集中学习了毛主席关于为人民服务、全局观点、增产节约等语录。当时，王杰的日记刚发表，大会也抓紧组织学习。各代表团成立了党支部，大会设立了党委办公室，抓紧做思想政治工作。不少代表团讨论了算小账与算大账、为什么不愿意多供货等思想认识问题。
    会上的政治空气浓厚了，资本主义经营思想受到了批判，社会主义经营作风发扬起来，出现了许多可喜的气象。
    会议发扬了全局观点。不少代表团通过挖掘内部潜力，增加了“热货”的供货量。黑龙江代表团了解到不少省份在水利建设中需要杂木棍，便把供应量由一千五百万根增加到两千五百万根。山东、湖南、云南等省，也增加了草帽辫、杂木、竹篾等物资的供货量。对于一部分供应不足的物资，各代表团都把供货、要货计划摆到桌面上，民主协商，按照保证重点，照顾一般和传统关系的原则，合理分配。
    会议发扬了抢困难、送方便的共产主义风格。例如，北京市代表团分配到的擦机器的回丝不够用，天津、上海就主动增加供货。内蒙古代表团分配到四百担桔子，后来了解到吉林省春节市场更需要，就主动让给吉林。
    不少代表团还本着自力更生、支持生产的精神，重新审查了要货计划。有些本地有资源、可以就地生产的产品，有些可以用其他物品代替的原料，就下决心在本地组织生产，不再向外要货。
    这样一来，到会议后期，供货计划反而超过了要货计划；比较缺乏的商品，也得到了合理分配，保证了重点需要。各个代表团的需要，基本上得到满足。个别“老生意经”曾经担心：“自己发扬风格，如果别人不发扬，岂不吃亏？”在这些事实面前，他们也认为自己的“老套套”应该改改了。
    交流会的经过说明，要政治挂帅，非经过斗争不行；要反对资本主义经营思想，必须采取坚决的斗争态度。例如会议过程中，有人迟迟不把“热货”拿出来，领导小组抱定不向资本主义经营思想让步的决心，不是去说情，而是进行正面教育，启发觉悟。交流会临近结束，领导小组了解到有个别代表团还有“热货”没有拿出来，也没有迁就资本主义经营作风，毅然决定按期闭幕。这种坚持社会主义原则的态度，保证了这次交流会自始至终能突出政治，并为今后的交流会进一步清除资本主义经营思想打下了良好的基础。
