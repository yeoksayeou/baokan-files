    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 3rd, the broad masses of voters in the directly elected district people's congress representative areas in the urban and suburban areas of the capital today joyfully voted to elect representatives to the Sixth District People's Congress.

    In more than a thousand polling stations throughout the city, voters came to vote in a continuous stream from morning to night. With a solemn attitude of resolutely ensuring that the "seal of power" is firmly grasped in the hands of the most reliable people, they conscientiously elected advanced figures from all walks of life to the district-level state power organs.

    The capital today was filled with a festive atmosphere, and revolutionary music reverberated throughout the city. Large banners reading "Hold High the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Advance Courageously," "Actively Participate in Elections and Exercise the Glorious Right to Be Masters of Our Own Affairs," "Strive to Realize the Third Five-Year Plan," "Strengthen National Defense and Defend the Motherland," "Resolutely Support the Vietnamese People's Struggle Against American Aggression and for National Salvation," "Long Live the Communist Party of China," and "Long Live Chairman Mao" were hung on streets, alleys, and many tall buildings. The polling stations, distributed in various areas of the city, were decorated magnificently with colorful flags, palace lanterns, flowers, and slogans. Each polling station hung the national flag and a portrait of Chairman Mao, and some even erected colorful arches at the entrance. Many voters went to the polling stations to vote just after midnight.

    Party and state leaders today voted with the broad masses of voters at the Zhongnanhai electoral district polling station in the Xicheng District to elect district people's representatives.

    The leaders of the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the CPC, and the Beijing Municipal People's Committee also went to the polling stations with the voters to cast their votes.

    The voters today exercised their rights as masters of their own affairs with extremely high political enthusiasm. Many voters put on their festive new clothes and rushed to the polling stations early to cast the first vote, and some voters who were temporarily away from home rushed back to exercise their right to vote. Voters from many units went to the polling stations to vote with gongs and drums. Some elderly people took their sons and daughters-in-law to vote together as a family. The Hongmiao No. 2 Primary School in the Beijing Thermal Power Plant electoral district was already crowded with voters waiting to vote when voting began at midnight today. Most of the eleven young teachers in this electoral district were participating in the election for the first time and were particularly excited. They rushed to the polling station early and were the first in line to vote. Many employees and family members of the plant also performed self-arranged literary and artistic programs before and after voting to express their joy of being masters of their own affairs. After finishing their late-night shifts, some workers from the Beijing No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory rushed to the polling stations and cast their solemn votes amidst the sound of firecrackers, electing Duan Yaru, an activist in studying Chairman Mao's works from the factory, and other advanced figures as representatives to the District People's Congress. Many polling stations also set up mobile ballot boxes to allow some elderly, weak, sick, and disabled voters who could not go out or were being treated in hospitals to vote.

    Students from various departments of Peking University held colorful flags and flowers, beat gongs and drums, and marched in formation to the polling stations to vote. They also shouted slogans: "Long Live the Communist Party!" "Long Live Chairman Mao!" The United Electoral District of the Nationalities Institute was filled with jubilation today. Colorful flags fluttered in front of the polling station, and a group of students from various ethnic groups in festive costumes danced to their hearts' content. The campus was filled with the song "Socialism is Good." Young students from dozens of ethnic groups from all over the country enjoyed equal rights here and cast their votes. Puba Qunco, a Tibetan girl from the Qamdo region, got up especially early today. After receiving her voter registration card, she conscientiously participated in the discussion of the candidate representatives. The daughter of this serf shed tears of excitement when she received her voter registration card. She said that she must listen to Chairman Mao's words, never forget class struggle, and strive to consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship.

    Many returned overseas Chinese also participated in the voting today. Some students who had recently returned from abroad also put on new clothes and solemnly exercised their rights as masters of their own affairs in their motherland for the first time.

    This general election in Beijing began more than a month ago. Before deliberating and discussing candidates, many voters also studied Chairman Mao's expositions on the people's democratic dictatorship and democratic centralism. When discussing the list of candidates proposed by parties, organizations, or by voter groups and individuals, many voter groups had debates and spoke freely, and the atmosphere of democracy was strong. In order to better understand the situation of the candidates, many voters also visited the candidates' work units. Voters also sincerely put forward hopes for some candidates, and the candidates humbly listened to the voters' opinions. Some voters also criticized individual candidates on the preliminary list, and after investigation, comparison, and consultation, they replaced them with more satisfactory people as candidates.

    The general election work in the rural areas of the far suburbs and near suburbs of Beijing is currently underway.

    “印把子”要牢牢掌握在最可靠的人手里
    首都普选区人民代表
    党和国家领导人同广大选民一起投票
    据新华社三日讯　首都城区和近郊直接选举区人民代表大会代表地区的广大选民，今天兴高采烈地投票选举第六届区人民代表大会代表。
    在全市的一千多个投票站里，前来投票的选民今天从早到晚络绎不绝。他们以坚决让“印把子”牢牢掌握在最可靠的人手里的庄严态度，认真地选举各行各业中的先进人物到区一级的国家权力机关里来。
    首都今天一片喜庆景象，革命乐曲震响着全城。大街小巷和许多高大建筑物上挂起了  “高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗奋勇前进”、“积极参加选举，行使当家作主的光荣权利”、“为实现第三个五年计划而奋斗”、“加强国防、保卫祖国”、“坚决支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争”、“中国共产党万岁”、“毛主席万岁”等大幅标语。分布在全市各个地区的投票站，被彩旗、宫灯、鲜花和标语打扮得十分壮观。各个投票站里都挂着国旗和毛主席像，有的还在门口搭起了彩牌。许多选民刚过零点就去投票站投票。
    党和国家领导人今天在西城区中南海选区投票站，和广大选民一起投票选举了区人民代表。
    中共中央华北局和中共北京市委、北京市人民委员会的负责人，也和选民们一起到投票站投了票。
    选民们今天以极高的政治热情，行使了当家作主的权利。许多选民穿上节日新装起早赶到投票站争投第一票，有的临时在外地的选民还赶回来行使选举权。不少单位的选民敲锣打鼓到投票站投票。有的老人带着儿子、儿媳全家一起去投票。北京热电厂选区在今天零点开始投票时，就已挤满了等待投票的选民。这个选区红庙第二小学的十一名青年教师大部分是第一次参加选举，心情格外激动。他们赶早到投票站，排在最前面投了票。这个厂的许多职工和家属在投票前后还演出了自己编排的文艺节目，表达他们当家作主的欢乐心情。北京第一棉纺织厂的一部分工人深夜下班后纷纷赶到投票站，在鞭炮声中投了庄严的一票，选举这个工厂的学习毛主席著作积极分子段雅茹等先进人物为区人民代表大会代表。许多投票站还设立了流动投票箱，让一些不能出门或正在医院治病的老弱病残选民投票。
    北京大学各系学生手举彩旗花朵，敲锣打鼓列队到投票站去投票。他们并高呼口号：“共产党万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”民族学院联合选区今天一片欢腾。投票站门前彩旗飘扬，一群身着节日盛装的各民族学生在尽情欢舞，校园里飘扬着《社会主义好》的歌声。来自全国各地的几十个民族的青年学生在这里享受着平等的权利，投了自己的一票。来自昌都地区的藏族姑娘普巴群错今天起得特别早。她领到选民证后，认真参加了代表候选人的讨论。这个农奴的女儿拿到选民证时激动地流下了热泪。她表示一定要听毛主席的话，决不忘记阶级斗争，努力巩固人民民主专政。
    许多归国华侨今天也参加了投票。一些不久前从国外回来的学生还特地穿起新衣服，第一次在祖国庄严地行使当家作主的权利。
    北京这次普选活动是在一个多月前开始的。许多选民在酝酿讨论候选人前，还学习了毛主席有关人民民主专政、民主集中制的论述。不少选民小组在讨论由党派、团体协商或由选民小组、个人提出的候选人名单时，有争有辩，畅所欲言，民主空气浓厚。为了更好了解候选人的情况，不少选民还到候选人的工作单位进行访问。选民们对有些候选人还诚恳地提出了希望，候选人虚心地听取了选民的意见。也有些选民对初步名单上的个别候选人提出了批评，他们经过调查、比较、协商后，换上了更满意的人作为候选人。
    北京远郊和近郊农村地区的普选工作目前正在进行中。
