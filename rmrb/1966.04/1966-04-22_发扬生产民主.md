    Promote Production Democracy

    In the high tide of agricultural production, how can we ensure that our progress is both rapid and steady? An important experience from Jinhua County, Zhejiang Province, is that we must fully promote production democracy and mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses.

    The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have taught us that rural people's communes and production teams should learn from the People's Liberation Army and implement the four major democracies: political, production, financial, and military. In the high tide of agricultural production, it is even more important to fully promote production democracy, so that major production matters and important reforms can be decided by the masses as masters of their own affairs. Only by fully promoting production democracy and being good at concentrating the opinions and wisdom of the masses can we make the thoughts and plans of the leaders more in line with objective reality, and better combine revolutionary zeal with a scientific attitude; only then can we further adjust the relationship between people in the struggle against nature, more fully mobilize the socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses, and promote the better and faster development of socialist productive forces.

    The process of developing production in Jinhua County is also the process of the County Party Committee following the mass line and fully promoting democracy. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "All work that requires the participation of the masses will be reduced to empty formalities and failure if there is no consciousness and willingness on the part of the masses." All matters concerning the masses "must be decided by the masses themselves, not by us on their behalf." On this issue, the Jinhua County Party Committee has accumulated many positive experiences and negative lessons in several years of practice. When they forcibly promoted "phosphorus-enhanced nitrogen" without the conscious willingness of the masses, the masses came up with various ways to oppose it; but when they followed Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings, personally squatted at the grassroots to conduct experiments, set examples, promote demonstrations, and enlightened the consciousness of the masses, a mass movement of consciously promoting "phosphorus-enhanced nitrogen" emerged, resulting in a substantial increase in production. When they decided on behalf of the masses and forcibly and blindly promoted the reform of agricultural crops, they were "punished" by nature and production decreased; when they changed their leadership methods, earnestly mobilized the masses, and consulted with the masses, the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses were developed, and agricultural production developed. It is precisely from constantly summarizing experience that the Jinhua County Party Committee gradually recognized the objective laws of leading production and the great significance of fully promoting production democracy, enabling the production movement to continuously develop and advance.

    The experience of the Jinhua County Party Committee vividly illustrates that correct leadership can only come from the masses and from practice. The broad masses of peasants are the practitioners of current collective production. They are most familiar with local natural conditions and production experience, and they are most concerned about collective production. As long as the leaders earnestly listen to the opinions of the masses, earnestly promote democracy, and follow the mass line, they can make their thoughts and plans in line with objective reality and achieve better results. If we do not pay attention to promoting democracy, do not trust the masses, and only formulate some unrealistic plans according to our own subjective wishes, and forcibly promote them, we will inevitably run into snags in the face of reality.

    Why do some county party committee comrades understand the importance of promoting democracy in theory, but often fail to promote democracy well and listen to the opinions of the masses in practice? We believe that there is a question of stance here, that is, how to view the masses. Some comrades often fail to correctly handle the relationship between leaders and the masses, always feeling that they are "smarter" than the masses, and impose their own opinions on the masses. This is of course wrong. We must strive to study Comrade Mao Zedong's works and use Comrade Mao Zedong's scientific mass viewpoint to defeat all kinds of non-proletarian viewpoints that despise the masses.

    At present, with the development of the socialist education movement and the movement of studying and applying Comrade Mao Zedong's works in a living way, the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has generally increased. Farming for the revolution and farming with scientific methods are becoming the conscious actions of the broad masses. On this ideological basis, further promoting production democracy can better mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses.

    Ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong taught us during the high tide of agricultural cooperativization that "we must be good at discovering the enthusiasm of the masses in essence." In the current high tide of agricultural production, we feel that this teaching is equally pertinent. The most fundamental thing for the development of agriculture in our country is to rely on the spirit of Dazhai, the policies of the Party, and the enthusiasm of the 500 million peasants. Fully promoting democracy, maximizing the mobilization of the enthusiasm of the masses, and guiding and organizing this enthusiasm into the current high tide of production is an issue that we need to pay close attention to in leading agricultural production.

### 发扬生产民主

    发扬生产民主
    在农业生产高潮中，怎样保证前进的步子又快又稳？浙江金华县的一条重要经验是：必须充分发扬生产民主，调动广大群众的社会主义积极性。
    党中央和毛泽东同志教导我们，农村人民公社和生产队，要向人民解放军学习，实行政治、生产、财务、军事四大民主。在农业生产高潮中，充分发扬生产民主，使生产上的重大事项和重要改革，都能由群众当家作主，显得更加重要。只有充分发扬生产民主，善于集中群众的意见和智慧，才能使领导者的思想、计划更加符合客观实际，把革命干劲和科学态度更好地结合起来：才能在对自然斗争中进一步调整人与人的关系，更充分地调动广大人民群众的社会主义积极性，促进社会主义生产力更好更快地向前发展。
    金华县发展生产的过程，也就是县委走群众路线，充分发扬民主的过程。毛泽东同志说，“凡是需要群众参加的工作，如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。”一切有关群众的事情，“必须由群众自己下决心，而不是由我们代替群众下决心。”在这个问题上，金华县委在几年的实践中，有不少正面的经验，也有不少反面的教训。当他们不经过群众的自觉自愿而硬性推广“以磷增氮”的时候，群众就想出各种办法来反对；而当他们遵照毛泽东同志的教导，亲自蹲点试验，作出样子，示范推广，启发了群众自觉的时候，就出现了自觉地推广“以磷增氮”的群众运动，使生产大幅度地上升。当他们代替群众下决心，硬性地、盲目地推行农作物改制的时候，就受到自然的“惩罚”而减产；当他们改变领导方法，认真发动群众，同群众商量办事的时候，群众的积极性和创造性就得到了发扬，农业生产就有了发展。金华县委正是从不断总结经验中，逐渐认识了领导生产的客观规律，认识了充分发扬生产民主的重大意义，使生产运动不断发展，不断前进。
    金华县委的经验生动地说明了，正确的领导只能从群众中来，从实践中来。广大农民群众是当前集体生产的实践者。他们对当地的自然条件和生产经验最为熟悉，对集体生产最为关心。领导者只要认真倾听群众的意见，认真发扬民主，走好群众路线，就能使思想和计划符合客观实际，获得较好的效果。如果不注意发扬民主，不相信群众，只是按照自己的主观愿望，制定一些不切实际的计划，硬要推行，必然会在实际面前碰壁。
    为什么一些县委同志在道理上也懂得发扬民主的重要，而在实践中却常常不能很好地发扬民主，倾听群众的意见呢？我们认为，这里有个立场问题，即如何看待群众的问题。有些同志常常不能正确处理领导和群众的关系，总觉得自己比群众“聪明”，而把自己的意见强加于群众。这当然是错误的。我们要努力学习毛泽东同志的著作，用毛泽东同志的科学的群众观点，战胜各种各样轻视群众的非无产阶级的观点。
    当前，随着社会主义教育运动的开展，随着活学活用毛泽东同志著作运动的开展，广大农民的社会主义觉悟普遍高涨。为革命种田，用科学方法种田，正在成为广大群众的自觉行动。在这样的思想基础上，进一步发扬生产民主，就能够更好地调动群众积极性。
    十年前，毛泽东同志在农业合作化高潮时期，教导我们“要善于从本质上发现群众的积极性”。在当前农业生产高潮中，我们想到这个教导是同样的亲切。我国农业的发展，最基本的是要靠大寨精神，靠党的政策，靠五亿农民的积极性。充分发扬民主，最大限度地调动群众的积极性，把这种积极性引导和组织到当前的生产高潮中来，这是我们在领导农业生产中需要十分重视的一个问题。
