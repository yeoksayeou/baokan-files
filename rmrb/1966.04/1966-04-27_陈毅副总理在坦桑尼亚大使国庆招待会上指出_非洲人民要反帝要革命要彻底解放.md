    Vice Premier Chen Yi Points Out at Tanzanian Ambassador's National Day Reception that African People Must Oppose Imperialism, Make Revolution, and Achieve Complete Liberation
    The counter-revolutionary current stirred up by imperialism for a time cannot stop the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause from moving forward. Ambassador Chuma points out that colonialists cannot stop the wind of change in Africa.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 26th – Tanzanian Ambassador to China, Waziri Juma, held a reception this afternoon to celebrate the National Day of the United Republic of Tanzania.
    Vice Premiers Chen Yi and Tan Zhenlin, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Lin Feng, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Gao Chongmin, Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Fu Zuoyi, President of the Supreme People's Court Yang Xiufeng, and others, were invited to attend the reception.
    Waziri Juma spoke at the reception. He talked about the Tanzanian people's struggle to defend national independence, and reviewed the tremendous achievements of the Tanzanian people in developing national economy and culture. He said: Colonialists and imperialists are desperately opposed to the unification of our people. Some forces are frantically carrying out activities and plotting conspiracies against our government and people.
    He pointed out that the dying horse of colonialism is being exposed to an unprecedented degree in many parts of Africa. The colonialists' walls of racism and repression cannot stop the wind of change. Tanzania will continue to assist the people of various colonies in their struggle against foreign rule and colonial oppression.
    The Ambassador emphasized that economic development must rely on the efforts of the people themselves. The Tanzanian people are determined to be masters of their own house. He said that the achievements of the great country of the People's Republic of China have given us tremendous encouragement. We Tanzanians wish you greater achievements in the days to come. He also expressed support for the restoration of China's legitimate rights in the United Nations.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi then spoke. He said: The Tanzanian people have waged unremitting struggles in defending national independence and state sovereignty, and opposing imperialist interference and subversion. They have made tremendous efforts in developing the national economy and national culture. They actively support the African national liberation movement and strive to safeguard the Asian-African solidarity against imperialism. The Chinese people are sincerely happy for every achievement of the Tanzanian people.
    In discussing the African situation, Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle is developing more deeply. However, all reactionary forces will never be reconciled to their demise, and imperialism will never automatically withdraw from Africa. Imperialism, headed by the United States, and old and new colonialism have been struggling desperately, using all means to maintain their colonial positions in Africa. Recently, they have been stepping up control and aggression, blatantly engaging in interference and subversion, and even repeatedly plotting reactionary coups. Facts further show that imperialism will not leave unless it is driven away, and it will not fall unless it is defeated. The African people must oppose imperialism, make revolution, and achieve complete liberation. This is the main trend of the development of the current situation in Africa. Imperialism's perverse actions can stir up a counter-revolutionary current for a time, but it can never stop the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary cause from moving forward. It will only prompt the African people to further raise their awareness, unite more closely, and launch struggles. Although there are still such or such difficulties on the road ahead, the increasingly awakened African people will certainly be able to carry the cause of unity against imperialism to the end, certainly be able to drive all imperialist and old and new colonialist forces out of Africa, and certainly be able to win the complete liberation of the African continent.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said: In the common struggle against imperialism, the Asian and African people are closely related, support each other, and are a whole. The Chinese people and the people of African countries share weal and woe and share the same destiny. The Chinese people have always stood on the side of the African people who persist in the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. We firmly support the just struggle of the people of African countries against imperialism headed by the United States and old and new colonialism, for the struggle to win and defend national independence, until they achieve final victory.
    The speeches of Ambassador Juma and Vice Premier Chen Yi aroused warm applause from the audience.
    Also invited to attend the reception were Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei, as well as heads of government departments, the People's Liberation Army, people's organizations, and Beijing Municipality.
    Heads of diplomatic missions of various countries to China also attended the reception.

    陈毅副总理在坦桑尼亚大使国庆招待会上指出
    非洲人民要反帝要革命要彻底解放
    帝国主义一时挑起的反革命逆流绝不能阻挡非洲人民反帝革命事业向前发展朱马大使指出殖民主义者挡不住非洲变革之风
    新华社二十六日讯　坦桑尼亚驻中国大使瓦齐里·朱马今天下午举行招待会，庆祝坦桑尼亚联合共和国国庆。
    陈毅、谭震林副总理，林枫副委员长和政协全国委员会副主席高崇民，国防委员会副主席傅作义，最高人民法院院长杨秀峰等，应邀出席了招待会。
    瓦齐里·朱马在招待会上讲话。他谈到了坦桑尼亚人民保卫民族独立的斗争，回顾了坦桑尼亚人民在发展民族经济、文化方面的巨大成就。他说：殖民主义者和帝国主义者是死命地反对我国人民的统一的。有些势力正在疯狂地活动和策划反对我国政府和人民的阴谋。
    他指出，殖民主义这匹垂死之马正在非洲许多地方遭到空前程度的揭露。殖民主义者的种族主义和镇压的铁墙是挡不住变革之风的。坦桑尼亚将继续援助各殖民地人民为反对外国统治和殖民主义压迫而进行的斗争。
    大使强调说，经济的发展必须依靠人民自己的努力。坦桑尼亚人民决心要自己当家作主。他说，中华人民共和国这个伟大国家的成就给了我们巨大的鼓舞。我们坦桑尼亚人祝你们在未来的日子里取得更大的成就。他还表示支持恢复中国在联合国中的合法权利。
    陈毅副总理接着讲话。他说：坦桑尼亚人民在捍卫民族独立和国家主权、反对帝国主义的干涉和颠覆方面进行了不懈的斗争。他们在发展民族经济和民族文化方面作出了巨大的努力。他们积极支持非洲民族解放运动，努力维护亚非团结反帝事业。中国人民为坦桑尼亚人民的每一个成就感到由衷的高兴。
    陈毅副总理在谈到非洲形势时指出，非洲人民的反帝革命斗争正在更加深入地向前发展。但是，一切反动势力绝不会自甘灭亡，帝国主义绝不会自动退出非洲。以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义一直在竭力挣扎，用尽一切手段来保持它们在非洲的殖民阵地。近来，它们正在加紧控制和侵略，露骨地进行干涉和颠覆，甚至接连策划反动政变。事实进一步表明，帝国主义是不赶不走、不打不倒的。非洲人民要反帝，要革命，要彻底解放。这是非洲当前形势发展的主流。帝国主义倒行逆施，可以一时挑起反革命的逆流，但是绝不能阻挡非洲人民反帝革命的事业向前发展。它只会促使非洲人民进一步提高觉悟，更加紧密团结，展开斗争。尽管前进道路上还有这样或那样的困难，日益觉醒的非洲人民一定能够把团结反帝事业进行到底，一定能够把帝国主义和新老殖民主义势力从非洲统统赶出去，一定能够赢得非洲大陆的彻底解放。
    陈毅副总理说：在反对帝国主义的共同斗争中，亚非人民休戚相关，相互支援，是一个整体。中国人民和非洲各国人民是同呼吸、共命运的。中国人民一贯站在坚持反帝革命斗争的非洲人民一边。我们坚决支持非洲各国人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的正义斗争，一直到他们取得最后的胜利。
    朱马大使和陈毅副总理的讲话，引起全场热烈的掌声。
    应邀出席招待会的还有外交部副部长姬鹏飞以及政府部门、人民解放军、人民团体和北京市的负责人。
    各国驻中国使节也出席了招待会。
