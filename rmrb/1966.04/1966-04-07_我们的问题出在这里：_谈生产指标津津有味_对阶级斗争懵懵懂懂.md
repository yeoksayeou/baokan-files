    Editor's Note: The four articles published here approach the same problem from different angles. This problem is that in all work, politics must be emphasized, and the line of class struggle must be grasped firmly, to adhere to the socialist direction.

    Why did some county committee comrades in the past "relish discussing production targets" while being "confused about class struggle"? Why did some enterprise party committee comrades in the past consider themselves "outsiders" and give up leading technical personnel? Why did some comrades attending material exchange meetings in the past always want to "make a grab" and "keep a trick up their sleeve"? The problem lies in forgetting class struggle and forgetting the struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. This inevitably leads to deviating from proletarian politics and losing the socialist direction.

    Leading agriculture certainly cannot ignore production; leading industry certainly cannot ignore technology; leading commerce certainly cannot ignore buying and selling. The question is on what basis you stand, in what direction you are heading, and according to what policies and guidelines you act. For example, to boost agricultural production, do you rely on political leadership or on work points? Do you rely on the socialist enthusiasm of the members or on the enthusiasm for developing individual production? In the production process and in management methods, the struggle between the two roads and the two ideologies is everywhere. If you do not see this, but only see sorghum, corn, and wheat, and only focus on water, fertilizer, and soil, merely focusing on production without questioning the direction or class struggle, you will lose your way and unknowingly deviate from the socialist track.

    In the nationwide discussion on the relationship between politics and business, this problem must be solved first.

    Our problem lies here:
    Relishing production targets while being confused about class struggle

    Recently, I have repeatedly considered a problem: Why do we squeeze out political work during the busy farming season? Why do we forget political work in favorable conditions? Why can't we insist on emphasizing politics at all times, in all things, and in all places? After studying Chairman Mao's works, I found the answer: It is due to a lack of clear class struggle perspective and insufficient understanding of the long-term and complex nature of class struggle. If we simply understand emphasizing politics as just ensuring the completion of a production task at a certain time, we cannot consciously insist on emphasizing politics at all times, in all things, and in all places.

    Chairman Mao teaches us that in the entire socialist period, there is class struggle and a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads. However, due to our insufficient understanding of this situation, we are not resolute in emphasizing politics. Usually, we say we need political leadership, but when it comes to actual work, we treat political work as a means to complete a specific task. Once the task is completed, political work is also done. In reality, this is placing politics in a subordinate position to business. During the busy farming season, our minds are filled with thoughts of production progress, numbers, and reports. We are anxious about production progress all day, thinking that anything that can quickly "boost" production progress is a good method. Thus, we often neglect politics and focus solely on production until the "task" is completed, and then we breathe a sigh of relief. However, is the task really "completed"? By what methods was it "completed"? We rarely ask these questions. When checking work, we ask more about progress and numbers and rarely inquire about the thoughts of cadres and the masses. As the saying goes, "The fish rots from the head down," and we work this way, so the lower-level cadres also follow suit. Over time, erroneous sayings like "politics and business take turns leading" and "emphasize politics during the slack season and production during the busy season" emerge.

    Looking back at the history of more than a decade since liberation, during the land reform period, in the midst of stormy class struggle, our understanding of class struggle was relatively clear; after achieving agricultural cooperativization and establishing people's communes, our awareness of class struggle gradually became blurred and weakened. What we see before us is one season after another of production, and our vision is blocked by grain, sugarcane, peanuts, sesame, and the like. We cannot clearly see the situation of class struggle. When the task is urgent, we think: "Political work can be put aside for a while; first, let's focus on boosting production." Little do we know, when we relax our political work among the peasants, capitalist thoughts rise up, even flooding in.

    For example, last autumn during the busy season, we thought: "Political work can be put aside for a while; after a bumper harvest, there will be a material foundation for work, so let's focus on production first." Thus, we buried ourselves in production and construction. As a result, in some places, grain was wasted after the harvest; some production teams only cared about themselves and not the state; some wealthy peasants shouted for division and consumption, and so on. At first, we did not realize that this was actually a manifestation of class struggle and the struggle between the two roads, adopting an attitude of not caring or ignoring it; later, we realized that this was the consequence of not emphasizing politics and not grasping class struggle.

    Isn't this exactly the situation criticized by the higher party committee as "relishing discussing production while being confused about class struggle"? Now, upon review, our problem indeed lies here.

### 我们的问题出在这里：  谈生产指标津津有味  对阶级斗争懵懵懂懂

专栏：

    编者按：这里发表的四篇文章，从各种不同的角度，说明了一个共同的问题。这就是在一切工作中，必须突出政治，抓紧阶级斗争这条“纲”，坚持社会主义方向。
    有些县委同志，过去为什么“谈生产指标津津有味，对阶级斗争懵懵懂懂”呢？有些企业党委同志，过去为什么以“外行”自卑，放弃对技术人员的领导呢？有些参加物资交流会的同志，过去为什么总想“捞一把”“留一手”呢？问题就在于忘记了阶级斗争，忘记了社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争。这就势必离开无产阶级政治，势必迷失社会主义方向。
    领导农业当然不能不抓生产；领导工业当然不能不搞技术；领导商业当然不能不讲买卖。问题在于你是站在什么立场上，朝着什么方向，按照什么方针政策办事。比如，要把农业生产搞上去，是依靠政治挂帅还是依靠工分挂帅？是依靠社员的社会主义积极性，还是依靠发展个体生产的积极性？在生产过程中，在经营方式中，两条道路、两种思想的斗争无所不在。如果看不到这些，仅仅看到高粱、玉米、谷，只抓水、肥、土，只是就生产抓生产，不问道路，不管阶级，那就会迷失方向，离开社会主义轨道而不自觉。
    在全国各地进行的政治和业务关系的大讨论中，必须首先解决这个问题。
    我们的问题出在这里：
    谈生产指标津津有味  对阶级斗争懵懵懂懂
    近来，我反复考虑一个问题：为什么我们在农忙季节，会挤掉政治工作？在顺利的条件下，会忘了政治工作？为什么不能做到时时、事事、处处坚持突出政治？学习毛主席著作以后，我找到了答案：没有明确的阶级斗争观点，对阶级斗争的长期性、复杂性认识不足，把突出政治简单地理解为只是保证一时的生产任务的完成，就不能自觉地坚持时时、事事、处处突出政治。
    毛主席教导我们，在整个社会主义阶段，存在着阶级斗争，存在着社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争。可是，我们由于对这种形势认识不足，突出政治也就不够坚决。平时口头上说要政治挂帅，一抓实际工作却把政治工作作为完成某一项具体任务的手段，具体任务完成了，政治工作也就完了。实际上这就是把政治摆在业务的从属地位。在农忙季节，我们满脑子考虑的都是生产进度、数字、报表之类的东西，整天为生产进度着急，认为什么东西能把生产进度尽快地“突”上去，就是好办法。于是，往往丢开政治，就生产来抓生产，直到“完成”了任务，才松了一口气。但是，任务是不是真的“完成”了呢？用什么方法“完成”的呢？很少去过问。检查工作时，也是问进度、要数字的多，很少过问干部和群众的思想问题。上行下效，我们这样干，下面的干部也就照样干。久而久之，什么“政治与业务轮流挂帅”、“农闲突出政治，农忙突出生产”等等错误说法就出来了。
    从解放十多年来的历史看，土地改革时期，在急风骤雨式的阶级斗争中，我们对阶级斗争的认识是比较清醒的；在实现了农业合作化，成立了人民公社以后，阶级斗争的观念就逐渐模糊和淡薄了。摆在面前的是一个季节接一个季节的生产，我们的眼光被粮食、甘蔗、花生、芝麻等等挡住了，不能清醒地看到阶级斗争的形势。任务一紧，就这样想：“政治放一放不要紧，先把生产‘突’上去再说。”谁知，就在我们稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作的时候，资本主义思想就抬头，甚至泛滥起来了。
    比如，去年秋季大忙的时候，我们想：政治工作放一放不要紧，丰收了，有了物质基础好做工作，先集中力量抓生产吧。于是，一头埋下去抓生产和建设。结果，有的地方丰收以后浪费粮食；有的生产队只顾自己不顾国家；有的富裕农民喊着要分光吃光等等。开始我们没有意识到这实质上是阶级斗争、两条道路斗争的表现，采取不理不睬的态度；后来，才认识到这是不突出政治，不抓阶级斗争的恶果。
    这不正是上级党委批评的那种“谈起生产来津津有味，对阶级斗争却懵懵懂懂”的情况吗！？现在检查起来，我们的问题正是出在这里。
