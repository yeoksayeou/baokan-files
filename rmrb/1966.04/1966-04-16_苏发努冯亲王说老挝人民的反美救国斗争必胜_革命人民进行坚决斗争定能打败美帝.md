    According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 15, Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Front and Vice Premier of the Lao Tripartite National Unity Government, recently pointed out in an article written for the Japanese people that the victories achieved by the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians in the anti-American patriotic struggle once again proved the brilliant truth of the times: even a top-notch imperialist like the United States can be defeated, and only the people who hold high the banner of justice and fight resolutely are invincible.
    The article, entitled "The Lao People's Patriotic Struggle Against U.S. Imperialism Will Surely Be Victorious," was entrusted by Prince Souphanouvong to Hisaya Konishi, a journalist from the Japan Press Service who visited the Lao liberated areas this March, and brought back to Japan. The article has been published in two installments in the "Akahata" on the 14th and 15th.
    The article stated that in the face of U.S. imperialist aggression, the Lao people must stand up, unite under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, and wage a life-and-death struggle against the U.S. imperialists. The Lao people's anti-American patriotic struggle is a continuation of the national liberation struggle of the past twenty years, a long-term and arduous struggle of the whole nation, and a struggle that is bound to be victorious, unfolding on the principle of self-reliance.
    The article said that U.S. imperialism has long attempted to eliminate the Lao liberated areas and revolutionary forces, thereby establishing a neo-colonialist system in Laos and enslaving the Lao people. However, the Lao liberated areas have always existed and been consolidated. They have not only become a solid base for carrying out the anti-American patriotic struggle, but also mean that the Lao people have achieved great victories.
    The article emphasized that the great victories achieved by the Lao patriotic soldiers and civilians in the struggle against U.S. imperialism once again prove the brilliant truth of the times: imperialists who pursue colonialism and are prone to aggression, even a top-notch imperialist like U.S. imperialism, are by no means invincible; and only the people who hold high the banner of justice and resolutely fight against U.S. imperialism are invincible.
    The article emphasized that a series of international events in recent years have made it clearer that the fatal weakness of U.S. imperialism lies in the fact that it is an aggressor and the common enemy of the people of the world. No force in the world can save U.S. imperialism from defeat. No conspiracy can stop the Lao people from advancing towards final victory.
    The article concluded by thanking the Japanese people for their support of the Lao people's struggle, and expressed warm support for the Japanese people's struggle against the U.S. imperialist occupation, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and for independence, democracy, neutrality, and peace.

    苏发努冯亲王说老挝人民的反美救国斗争必胜
    革命人民进行坚决斗争定能打败美帝
    据新华社东京十五日电  老挝爱国战线党主席、老挝三方面民族团结政府副首相苏发努冯亲王，最近在一篇为日本人民写的文章中指出，老挝爱国军民在反美救国斗争中所取得的胜利，再一次证明了当代的光辉真理：即使是象美国那样的头等的帝国主义，也是可以打败的，只有高举正义的旗帜坚决进行斗争的人民，才是无往而不胜的。
    这篇文章的题目是《老挝人民反对美帝国主义的救国斗争必定胜利》，是苏发努冯亲王委托今年三月访问老挝解放区的日本新闻社记者小西久弥带回日本的，文章已经分两次刊登在十四日和十五日的《赤旗报》上。
    文章说，面对美帝国主义的侵略，老挝人民只有站起来，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，团结一致，同美帝国主义者进行你死我活的斗争。老挝人民的反美救国斗争，是二十年来的民族解放斗争的继续，是全民的长期而艰巨的斗争，是根据依靠自己力量的原则而展开的必定胜利的斗争。
    文章说，美帝国主义很早以来就妄图消灭老挝的解放区和革命力量，从而在老挝建立新殖民主义制度，奴役老挝人民。但是，老挝解放区一直存在着、巩固着，它不仅成为进行抗美救国斗争的坚固基地，同时它也意味着老挝人民取得了很大的胜利。
    文章强调指出，老挝爱国军民在反对美帝国主义的斗争中所取得的伟大胜利，再一次证明了当代的光辉真理：推行殖民主义的侵略成性的帝国主义，即使是象美帝国主义那样的头等的帝国主义，也决不是打不败的；并且只有高举正义的旗帜，坚决同美帝国主义进行斗争的人民，才是无往而不胜的。
    文章强调指出，最近几年来国际上的一系列事件更加清楚地表明：美帝国主义的致命弱点就在于它是侵略者，它是全世界人民的公敌。世界上没有任何力量能把美帝国主义从失败中挽救出来。任何阴谋都不能阻止老挝人民向着最后的胜利前进。
    文章最后感谢日本人民对老挝人民斗争的支持，并对日本人民为反对美帝国主义的占领、反对复活日本军国主义的斗争，争取独立、民主、中立、和平的斗争表示热烈支持。
