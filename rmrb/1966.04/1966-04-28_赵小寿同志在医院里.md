    Xinhua News Agency, 27th. Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, a staff member of our embassy in Indonesia who returned from Jakarta, is currently receiving treatment in a hospital in Beijing. In the process of fighting against his injuries and illness, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou similarly demonstrated the noble qualities of a strong revolutionary fighter.

    Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou, who suffered a serious injury to his right chest, traveled from Guangzhou to Beijing upon returning to the motherland. Enduring severe pain during the long journey, he never cried out in pain. When the doctors changed his dressings and cleaned his wounds, sometimes causing him to sweat profusely, he never asked for a painkiller shot or took a painkiller pill. He closely cooperated with the medical staff in his treatment, demonstrating the hard-bone spirit of a revolutionary fighter. Although his injury was severe, he is now in good spirits.

    In the hospital, the medical staff greatly admired Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou's heroic fighting spirit and strong will. Comrades extended their warm regards to him and expressed their intention to learn from him. However, Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou repeatedly said modestly, "I have not completed my tasks well, and I have nothing worthy of learning."

    During the time permitted by the doctor, Zhao Xiaoshou insisted on reading Chairman Mao's books in bed. There was a quotation board of Chairman Mao's sayings in the ward, which read: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are frightening, but in reality, they don't have much power." He looked at it again and again, reading it over and over. Another quotation read: "The world is yours, as well as ours, but in the last analysis, it is yours. You young people are full of vigor and vitality, in the flourishing period, like the sun at eight or nine in the morning. Our hope is placed on you." These words of Chairman Mao added boundless strength to him.

    Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou is being cared for as a seriously wounded patient in the hospital, but he has always demanded of himself as an ordinary soldier, always thinking of the convenience of the medical staff. Seeing that he had difficulty moving his hands, the medical staff wanted to read the newspaper to him and feed him, but he insisted on holding the newspaper himself and eating on his own. The medical staff said to him, "You have a serious injury. You can order whatever dishes you want, and we will prepare them for you." But he never ordered any special dishes or meals. He said, "I will eat whatever there is. It's very good now." Once, when Zhao Xiaoshou was eating porridge, the nurse saw that he was having a little trouble finishing it and asked him to put it down. But he refused and insisted on finishing it, not wanting to waste a single grain of food.

    In the past few days, some responsible comrades have come to the hospital to visit him. Comrade Zhao Xiaoshou repeatedly expressed his gratitude for the organization's concern for him. He said, "I must treat my injury well and strive to be discharged from the hospital as soon as possible. In the future, I want to do more work for the Party."

    赵小寿同志在医院里
    新华社二十七日讯　从雅加达回国的我驻印度尼西亚大使馆工作人员赵小寿同志，目前正在北京的一所医院治疗。赵小寿同志在同伤病作斗争的过程中，同样表现了一个坚强的革命战士的高贵品质。
    右胸负重伤的赵小寿同志返回祖国时，经广州回北京，长途跋涉，忍受着剧痛，没有叫过一声痛。医生给他换药、洗伤口，有时痛得他满头大汗，但是，他从未要求打过一次止痛针，吃过一片止痛药。他密切配合医务人员治疗，表现了革命战士的硬骨头精神。他虽然伤很重，可是现在精神很好。
    在医院里，医务人员对赵小寿同志的英勇斗争精神和坚强意志十分敬佩。同志们向他亲切慰问，表示要向他学习，可是赵小寿同志一再谦逊地说：“我没有很好地完成任务，我是没有什么值得学习的。”
    在医生许可的时间里，赵小寿在病床上还坚持读毛主席的书。病房里有一块毛主席语录板，上面写着：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”他看了又看，读了一遍又一遍。另一段语录写着：“世界是你们的，也是我们的，但是归根结底是你们的。你们青年人朝气蓬勃，正在兴旺时期，好象早晨八、九点钟的太阳。希望寄托在你们身上”。毛主席的这些话，给他增添了无限的力量。
    赵小寿同志在医院里是按重伤号护理的，可是他一直以普通一兵要求自己，总是为医护人员的方便着想。医护人员看他两手活动不方便，要给他读报，给他喂饭，可是他一定坚持自己拿着报纸看，自己动手吃饭。医护人员对他说：“你有重伤，想吃什么饭菜，可以随意要，我们都给你准备。”但他没有点过一次菜和饭。他说：“有什么就吃什么，现在就很好了。”有一次，赵小寿吃稀饭，护士看他吃到最后有点吃不下了，要他放下不吃，但他不肯，还是坚持吃完，不愿浪费一粒粮食。
    这几天来，一些负责同志到医院去看望他，赵小寿同志一再感激组织上对他的关怀。他说：“我一定要好好治伤，争取快一点出院，以后我还要为党做更多的工作。”
