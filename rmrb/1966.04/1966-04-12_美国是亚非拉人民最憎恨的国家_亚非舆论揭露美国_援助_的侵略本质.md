    The US is the Most Hated Country by the People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America
    ——Asian and African Public Opinion Exposes the Aggressive Nature of US "Aid"
    The US Wants to Turn Aid Recipients into Satellite States
    Cambodia's National Radio Station broadcast an article on the evening of the 8th, condemning the US for using so-called "aid" to turn recipient countries into US satellite states.
    The article pointed out: "Cambodia understands how harmful US aid is. After refusing this aid and severing relations with the US, we have acted in a way that fully conforms to our national interests. As a result, our economic situation has immediately improved. If we encountered some difficulties in the initial stage, we overcame them with our own hands, which is something we are proud of."
    Cambodia's National Radio Station said that the "self-help" advocated by US imperialism "is to establish puppet governments and outdated political systems according to the ideas of US imperialism, so that the US can carry out activities and plunder raw materials unscrupulously, while forcing the countries concerned to purchase equipment from the US and follow US policies and diplomatic activities. Therefore, the countries that 'self-help' become political and economic patrons of the US in this process. To put it more clearly, this is a satellite state in name and in fact."
    "US Aid" Comes at the Cost of Independence and Freedom
    Philippine *Manila Chronicle* columnist Soliongco published an article on the 10th, pointing out that the US "has become the symbol of 20th-century imperialism" and "is the most hated country in vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."
    Soliongco said that the US "is deeply mired in quicksand everywhere in Latin America, Africa, and Asia, desperately trying to grab some withered branches for support in order to survive."
    He emphasized that US "aid" with conditions attached "even angers the starving recipients." "The people of Asia, Latin America, and Africa painfully recognize the fact that they have to pay a portion of their freedom and independence for every bushel of American wheat they receive."
    He said: "No Asian, except the most depraved, can ignore what the Americans are doing in Vietnam." In Africa, the US "does not conceal, and cannot conceal, the truth that there are huge investments by American big trusts in the incredibly rich mines of the Congo, and they must protect these investments for economic and strategic purposes." He said that the people of Latin America know that they can only rely on themselves to oppose US plunder.
    The Nature of US Imperialism is to Exploit
    Tanzania's *Nationalist* published a commentary on the 9th, exposing how US imperialism uses "aid" to Asian and African countries to achieve its ulterior motives. The commentary said that Asian and African countries must rely on their own efforts to develop their national economies.
    The newspaper, in commenting on the recent "large-scale aid" given by US imperialists to the new regime in Ghana, pointed out: "The imperialists want to use Ghana to illustrate that as long as the behavior of a country's leaders pleases the imperialists, they can do something to help that country develop its economy."
    The commentary continued, saying that the US wants to "aid" these countries because these countries "have abandoned their non-alignment practices and have now become openly pro-imperialist."
    The commentary said that the "nature of imperialism is to exploit." If they invest one hundred shillings in Asian and African countries, they will recoup one thousand shillings from there. The commentary pointed out that they will not use their "aid" to seek happiness for the people.　(Xinhua News Agency)

### 美国是亚非拉人民最憎恨的国家——亚非舆论揭露美国“援助”的侵略本质

    美国是亚非拉人民最憎恨的国家
    ——亚非舆论揭露美国“援助”的侵略本质
    美国要把受援国变成卫星国
    柬埔寨国家电台八日晚上发表一篇文章，谴责美国利用所谓“援助”使受援国成为美国的卫星国。
    文章指出：“柬埔寨懂得美援是多么有害，在拒绝这种援助和断绝同美国的关系以后，我们就采取了完全符合我们国家利益的方式来办事，因此我国的经济形势就立即有了好转。如果说开始的阶段我们遇到一些困难，但是我们用自己的双手克服了困难，这是我们引为自豪的”。
    柬埔寨国家电台说，美帝国主义所提倡的“自助”，“就是按照美帝国主义的想法建立傀儡政府和过时的政治制度，从而使美国能肆无忌惮地进行活动和掠夺原料资源，同时迫使有关国家向美国购买装备和跟随美国的政策和外交活动。因此，“自助”的国家在这个过程中就变成了美国政治和经济的顾主，说得更清楚些，这就是名副其实的卫星国。”
    “美援”要以独立自由为代价
    菲律宾《马尼拉纪事报》专栏作家索利翁科十日发表的一篇文章指出，美国“已成为二十世纪帝国主义的标志”，而且“是亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲广大地区的最可恨的国家”。
    索利翁科说，美国“在拉丁美洲、非洲和亚洲到处深陷在流砂之中，它拼命想抓住一些枯朽的树枝来作依靠，借以求生”。
    他强调说，附有条件的美“援”“甚至使挨饿的受援者也感到愤怒”。“亚洲、拉丁美洲和非洲的人们痛苦地认识到这样一个事实，即他们要为收到每一蒲式耳的美国小麦付出一部分自由和独立。”
    他说：“任何亚洲人，除了最堕落的以外，不能无视美国人在越南所干的事。”在非洲，美国“不掩饰，也不能掩饰这样一个真相：在无比富饶的刚果矿山里，有美国大托辣斯的巨大投资，他们为了经济和战略目的，就必须保护这些投资”。他说，拉丁美洲人民知道，他们只能依靠自己来反对美国的掠夺。
    美帝国主义本性就是要剥削
    坦桑尼亚《民族主义者报》九日发表评论，揭露美帝国主义利用对亚非国家的“援助”，来实现它的不可告人的目的。这篇评论说，亚非国家必须依靠自己的努力来发展民族经济。
    这家报纸在评论美帝国主义者最近给予加纳新政权的“大规模援助”时指出：“帝国主义者想拿加纳来说明，只要一个国家的领导人的行为能使帝国主义者感到高兴，他们就能够为帮助那个国家发展经济做些什么。”
    评论接着说，美国要“援助”这些国家，因为这些国家“已经放弃了它们的不结盟的做法，现在已变得公然亲帝国主义了”。
    评论说，帝国主义者的“本性就是要剥削”。如果他们在亚非国家投资了一百先令，他们就要从那里捞回一千先令。评论指出，他们不会用他们的“援助”来为老百姓谋幸福的。　（据新华社讯）
