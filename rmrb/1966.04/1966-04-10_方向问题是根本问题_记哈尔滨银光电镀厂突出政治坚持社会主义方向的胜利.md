    The Question of Direction is a Fundamental Question
    ——A Record of the Victory of Harbin Yinguang Electroplating Factory in Emphasizing Politics and Adhering to the Socialist Direction
    Editor's Note: Any undertaking in socialist construction has a question of direction. This is determined by the existence of class struggle and the struggle between two roads in socialist society. Comrade Mao Zedong said: "If socialism does not occupy the rural front, capitalism will inevitably occupy it." The same applies to rural areas, factories, shops, schools, and all other units. The reason why all our work must take class struggle as the key link, and why we must give prominence to politics, is first and foremost to solve this question of direction.
    Why was the Harbin Yinguang Electroplating Factory one way before 1962 and another way after 1962? Why was it able to jump from a backward enterprise to an advanced, Daqing-style enterprise in just three years? The fundamental reason lies in the fact that before 1962, capitalist ideology was rampant in this factory, and only after 1962 did this factory have a firm socialist direction. The struggle to rectify the enterprise in 1962 was a class struggle to reverse the direction. All the changes in the Yinguang Electroplating Factory began with the change in this fundamental direction. The question of direction is indeed a fundamental question.
    All the victories of the Harbin Yinguang Electroplating Factory are victories of emphasizing politics and adhering to the socialist direction.
    The Harbin Yinguang Electroplating Factory holds high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, gives prominence to politics, and persists in taking class struggle and the struggle between two roads as the key link to drive all work forward. Since 1962, this factory has successively fought several "turnaround battles" in political thought, production technology, and enterprise management, enabling the enterprise to get rid of its backwardness and enter the ranks of the advanced. Compared with 1962, the factory's physical labor productivity increased fourfold in 1965, and nine new varieties such as cadmium plating, hard chrome plating, and bright zinc-copper plating were added. The electroplating quality of products such as door handles and hair clippers has reached the advanced domestic level, and the electroplating processing cost has been reduced by 17 percent. This factory has set an example for small and medium-sized enterprises to realize revolutionization. At the recent National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference, it was recommended as one of the 70 Daqing-style advanced units.

    The Struggle Between Two Roads in Enterprise Development
    The Harbin Yinguang Electroplating Factory was originally a factory with many problems and backward production. Since it was merged into a factory from five handicraft cooperatives in 1958, the class struggle and the struggle between the two roads have been very sharp: the leadership of the enterprise has not truly been in the hands of the working class. There were serious capitalist ideas and styles in business management. When undertaking processing tasks, they asked exorbitant prices, overestimated costs, overcharged processing fees, and the quality of the plated parts was poor. At that time, the total cost of producing a hair clipper in Shanghai was only 1.2 yuan, while they charged 1.85 yuan for electroplating one clipper. The knives and lighters and other products electroplated for brother factories, because of the lack of careful processing and inaccurate ingredients, many plated parts oxidized and peeled off before they left the warehouse, and had to be reworked and re-plated, causing waste. Many factories had great opinions about them and would rather send their products to Shanghai for plating thousands of miles away than entrust them to the Harbin factory. Therefore, their business was sluggish and their doors were deserted.
    Whether to adhere to the socialist direction or take the capitalist road had become a fundamental issue for the factory's survival. In 1962, with the help of the higher-level Party committee, the factory, taking class struggle and the struggle between two roads as the key link, mobilized all employees to carry out a resolute struggle against the capitalist business ideas and business styles that were rampant in the enterprise.
    This struggle raised the class consciousness of all the factory's employees and promoted their socialist enthusiasm. Cui Lianlong, an old worker who had suffered cruel exploitation by capitalists, said excitedly: "Since the merger and transformation of the factory, I have been unspeakably happy to see the development of production. However, some people are not following the same path as us and are secretly digging at the foundation of socialism. The factory's work has not improved in the past two years. The root cause is that it has not followed Chairman Mao's words and has not adhered to the socialist road." Old worker Li Fu said: "The capitalists in the old society could do anything immoral for money. This is not something our socialist enterprises should do. In the past, when I saw our factory overestimating costs and asking high prices and cutting corners and reducing quality when plating for brother enterprises, I felt really sad! Isn't this someone deliberately trying to get us to take the road back? Our working class must adhere to the revolution to the end and adhere to the socialist road!"
    This struggle curbed the evil wind of capitalism and promoted the proletarian spirit of righteousness. The higher-level Party committee adjusted the leadership and supplemented the leadership core with Party members and cadres who were firm in their stance, highly conscious, good in production and work, and deeply supported by the masses. In this way, the leadership of the enterprise was truly in the hands of the working class.
    After this struggle, the revolutionary spirit of all the factory's employees was greatly invigorated. Running a socialist factory in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao has become everyone's common will and a powerful driving force for transforming the enterprise.

    The Struggle Between Two Ideologies in Technological Transformation
    The employees, who had been reinvigorated with revolutionary spirit, were determined to improve production, but the backward technical equipment restricted their hands and feet.
    At that time, most of the factory's production equipment consisted of backward basins, jars, large vats, wooden troughs, and stoves. Most of the processes still relied on "manual operation and visual inspection." There was no ventilation equipment in the workshop. Smoke and dust filled the air, affecting the health of the workers and the quality of the products. How could production be improved if this situation was not changed? At the beginning of 1963, the Party branch issued a call to all employees to carry out technological transformation through self-reliance and change the backward production technology.
    However, at this time, there were two different reactions in the factory. Most employees advocated carrying out technological transformation through self-reliance. They said, "The higher-level authorities attach importance to us, and large factories are also helping us. These are good conditions, but we still have to rely on our own efforts to stand up." A few people had the idea of relying on higher-level authorities. They said, "Just wait, we don't have to bother. When the time comes, we will be wearing white coats and white gloves, working on new equipment." Some people doubted, saying: "Electroplating has been done this way for many years. With our bunch of people, we have nothing. Can we change it?"
    The factory Party branch believed that this was a reflection of the struggle between two ideologies under the new conditions, and decided not to discuss specific technical transformation issues first, but to sit down and study Chairman Mao's expositions on self-reliance and criticize the "two reliance" ideology of simply relying on higher-level authorities and relying on large factories. Old worker Cui Lianlong said: "We are not afraid of being backward, but we are afraid of lacking ambition; as long as we have a revolutionary spirit, there is nothing we cannot do!" Communist Party member and machine repair worker Zhao Hetao said: "Yugong alone was determined to move mountains. We have more than two hundred revolutionary hands and two hundred revolutionary hearts. As long as we are willing to work hard, we will definitely be able to transform technology!" After study and discussion, many people dispelled their ideological concerns, strengthened their confidence, and vowed to rely on their own hands to remove the label of technical backwardness.
    The electroplating tanks in the factory emitted toxic gases all day long, which affected the health of the workers and the quality of the products. Therefore, installing ventilation equipment became the first high ground for them to attack. But how many difficulties lay in front of them! Blueprints, none! Technical personnel, none! Equipment? The factory only had a broken belt lathe, a bench drill, and two vices. What difficulties! But the old workers Zhao Hetao, Wang Guilin, and Ye Wenqing took the lead and led the way. They did not understand the structure of ventilation equipment and could not design it, so they went around seeking teachers and friends, visiting and learning. They studied a lot of reference materials, and did not miss even the photos in relevant magazines, trying to design a ventilation device. However, when they heard that it would cost more than 1,600 yuan to process it outside, everyone decided to save this money. They did not know how to scribe or cut materials, so they went out to learn, learned and then did it, learning while doing it, working enthusiastically. It was just in time for the Spring Festival, and the workers gave up their holiday rest and rushed to install the factory's first ventilation equipment made with their own hands. Then, with the strong help of the Harbin Electric Meter Instrument Factory, they further promoted the revolutionary spirit of hard struggle and successively manufactured thirteen power ventilation equipment and five natural ventilation equipment, and installed them in the workshop.
    People who had tasted the sweetness of self-reliance became more and more motivated. In a short period of time, three 30-meter-long ventilation duct trenches were dug by themselves; the partition walls in the workshop were built by themselves; sixteen large plating tanks were made by themselves; more than 30 special equipment were made by themselves..., everything they could do themselves was done by themselves. The task of technological transformation, which was originally planned to be completed in five months, was actually completed in only 56 days; the planned technical transformation cost was 300,000 yuan, but the actual cost was only 153,000 yuan. The Harbin Yinguang Electroplating Factory, after technological transformation, took on a new look, the process route became more reasonable, the operating procedures and technical standards became more unified, and for the first time in history, there was a laboratory and a dispensing room, realizing scientific production. The smoke-filled workshop, after having dust collection and ventilation equipment, became bright and clean with fresh air.

    The Struggle Between Two Lines in Management Work
    The victory of technological transformation has brought tremendous changes to the factory. At this time, the backwardness in enterprise management became more and more obvious. Originally, "Yinguang" was a specialized small factory, with relatively concentrated production, simple processes, and not very complicated management, but they blindly imitated large factories, established five sections and four workshops, and implemented three-level management. The factory had only 200 employees, and 36 of them were full-time cadres, accounting for 18% of the total number of employees. The overlapping of institutions, mutual entanglement, and complicated procedures not only bound the enthusiasm of the workers, but also tied the hands and feet of the leading cadres. They floated above all day long and could not go down, and the decision of cadres to participate in labor was not well implemented.
    How to improve management work? People's thinking diverged again. Some people believed that as production developed, management departments should increase personnel; some people were afraid that fewer people would have more work to do and work would be tiring after simplifying management institutions; some were afraid of lowering their positions and "underutilizing talents"; some were afraid of going down to the workshop to work and being useless, reducing income, so they all opposed simplifying management institutions. However, most people believed that the institutions should be thoroughly reformed to break the old frameworks, old ideas, and old styles that hindered production development, and carry out a great revolution in management work.
    Who should run the enterprise, the workers or only a few leaders? How to manage production, rely solely on institutions and systems to manage and control, or rely on fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of all employees? Are cadres the servants of the people, or officials and masters? Are management institutions for managing and controlling production, or for serving production? The factory Party branch sharply raised these questions and organized employees to start a discussion. After study and discussion, three issues were centrally resolved in the cadres' minds: First, being a cadre is not being an "official" but doing revolution. Revolutionary cadres should be able to go up and down, be able to do "wen" and "wu"; second, management institutions should not put the word "guan" (manage) first, but should serve production; third, leading cadres and management personnel should not be separated from labor and the masses, but should manage production well through labor, being both managers and producers. All of these are the fundamental guarantees that revolutionary cadres will never change their nature.
    After using Mao Zedong Thought to untangle the knots in the cadres' minds, they established a new type of management system of "three lines of work, face-to-face leadership, and service to the front line" based on the actual situation of the factory, and implemented two-level management. Factory leaders and management cadres are responsible for the three lines of political thought, production technology, and logistics supply, serve the teams and groups, and work to the teams and groups.
    The management revolution made the factory's management team lean and powerful. The number of full-time cadres was reduced from 36 to 11, from 18% of the total number of employees to only 3.75%.
    The revolution in management work freed the cadres from many trivial affairs, creating conditions for squatting down to work. Factory-level cadres worked half a day and labored half a day, and general cadres participated in labor two or three days a week. Comrade Zhang Liye, the secretary of the branch, spent a lot of time attending meetings outside in 1965. However, every time he came back from a meeting, he immediately insisted on laboring for half a day, and strived to make up for the labor days delayed by attending the meeting. This year, he participated in a total of 95 days of labor.
    The revolution in management work fully mobilized the enthusiasm of workers to participate in enterprise management. In the past, the daily management work of the grassroots was done by full-time cadres; now, the workers themselves are responsible for it. Each production team and auxiliary team has set up a work management officer, and the factory has set up a management team combining full-time cadres and the masses, forming a mass management system. 58% of the factory's workers participate in various management work, totaling 145 people, and they accurately and timely complete the recording and accounting work of the group's production statistics, labor wages, and material consumption every day. Someone asked them: "Your factory only has 3.75% of full-time cadres, how can you manage it?" The leaders of this factory said: "We rely on everyone to manage it, rely on the masses to run the enterprise!"
    After implementing the revolution in management work, this factory also tried the practice of workers and cadres rotating shifts. From the second half of 1964 to now, 6 of the factory's 11 cadres have been rotated in three batches. "Rotating shifts" - cadres go down to be workers for a certain period of time to transform their thinking, learn technology, and move towards the intellectualization of laborers. "Rotating shifts" - some workers with conditions participate in management work for a certain period of time to enhance the overall view and learn management skills, finding a way to gradually narrow the difference between mental and physical labor.
    At present, Yinguang Electroplating Factory is strictly summarizing its work with two points of view, exposing contradictions, and finding gaps. They see that compared with the revolutionary spirit of Daqing people, there are still great gaps in terms of leadership revolutionization, employee revolutionization, and enterprise revolutionization, and there are still many problems in production. How will the future road go? Their answer is: they cannot lie down on their achievements and sleep soundly, they must still go all out to catch up and surpass; the prospect is infinitely good, strive to be the best, and are determined to adhere to highlighting politics and creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the new year, so that all work can achieve greater results.

### 方向问题是根本问题——记哈尔滨银光电镀厂突出政治坚持社会主义方向的胜利

    方向问题是根本问题
    ——记哈尔滨银光电镀厂突出政治坚持社会主义方向的胜利
    编者按：社会主义建设的任何一项事业，都有一个方向问题。这是社会主义社会存在着阶级斗争和两条道路斗争所决定的。毛泽东同志说过：“对于农村的阵地，社会主义如果不去占领，资本主义就必然会去占领。”农村如此，工厂、商店、学校以及其他一切单位莫不如此。我们的一切工作，所以要以阶级斗争为纲，所以要突出政治，首先就是为了解决这个方向问题。
    哈尔滨银光电镀厂，为什么一九六二年以前是一个样子，一九六二年以后变成了另一个样子呢？为什么能够从一个落后企业，仅仅三年的时间，就一跃而成为大庆式的先进企业呢？根本原因就在于，一九六二年以前，这个厂资本主义思想泛滥，一九六二年以后，这个厂才有了坚定的社会主义方向。一九六二年进行的整顿企业的斗争，就是一场扭转方向的阶级斗争。银光电镀厂的一切变化，都是随着这个根本方向的变化而开始的。方向问题的确是个根本问题。
    哈尔滨银光电镀厂的一切胜利，是突出政治、坚持社会主义方向的胜利。
    哈尔滨银光电镀厂高举毛泽东思想红旗，突出政治，坚持以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，带动各项工作。从一九六二年以来，这个厂在政治思想、生产技术、企业管理等方面，接连打了几个“翻身仗”，使企业摆脱了落后面貌，跨入先进行列。一九六五年和一九六二年相比，这个厂的实物劳动生产率提高四倍，增加了镀镉、镀硬铬、镀亮锌铜等九个新品种。门拉手、理发推子等产品的电镀质量，达到了国内先进水平；电镀加工成本降低百分之十七。这个厂为中小型企业实现革命化树立了榜样。在不久前召开的全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议上，它被推荐为七十个大庆式先进单位之一。
    企业发展中两条道路的斗争
    哈尔滨银光电镀厂，原来是一个问题很多，生产落后的工厂。自从一九五八年由五个手工业社合并为工厂以后，阶级斗争和两条道路斗争，一直表现得很尖锐：企业领导权没有真正掌握在工人阶级的手中。在经营管理上存在着严重的资本主义思想和作风。承揽加工任务时漫天要价，高估成本，多收加工费，镀件质量低劣。当时上海生产一把理发推子的总成本才一元二角，而他们电镀一把推子就要一元八角五。给兄弟工厂电镀的小刀、打火机等产品，因为加工不精心，配料不准确，没等出库就有很多镀件氧化脱层了，得返工重镀，造成浪费。不少工厂对他们的意见很大，宁肯千里迢迢把产品送往上海去镀，也不愿委托他们加工。因此，他们的业务萧条，门庭冷落。
    是坚持社会主义方向，还是走资本主义道路，当时已经成为这个厂能不能存在下去的根本问题。一九六二年，这个厂在上级党委的帮助下，以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，发动全体职工，向泛滥在企业里的资本主义经营思想和经营作风进行了坚决的斗争。
    这场斗争，提高了全厂职工的阶级觉悟，发扬了他们的社会主义积极性。曾遭受过资本家残酷剥削的老工人崔连隆激动地说：“合并转厂以来，看到生产发展，我心里有说不出来的高兴。可是，有人跟咱们不走一条道，偷偷摸摸挖社会主义的墙脚。工厂这两年工作没搞上去，病根就是没有按毛主席的话办事，没有坚持走社会主义道路。”老工人李富说：“旧社会的资本家，为了钱什么缺德事都能干出来。这种事不是咱们社会主义企业应当干的。以前，看到咱们工厂给兄弟企业镀活时，多估成本要高价，偷工减料质量差，心里真难受呵！这不是有人成心想叫咱们走回头路吗？我们工人阶级要坚持革命到底，坚持走社会主义道路！”
    这场斗争，煞住了资本主义歪风，伸张了无产阶级正气。上级党委为他们调整了领导力量，并把那些立场稳、觉悟高、生产和工作好、深受群众拥护的党员和干部充实到领导核心中来。这样，这个企业的领导权，才真正掌握在工人阶级手中。
    经过这场斗争，全厂职工的革命精神大为振作。按照党中央和毛主席指示办好社会主义的工厂，成为大家的共同意志，成为改造企业的强大动力。
    技术改造中两种思想的斗争
    振起革命精神的职工们，一心想把生产搞好，但是落后的技术设备束缚着他们的手脚。
    当时，这个厂的生产设备多是些落后的盆盆罐罐、大缸、木槽和火炉等，大部分工序还是“操作靠手工，检查靠眼睛”。厂房里没有通风设备，烟雾迷漫，粉尘飞扬，影响工人健康，影响产品质量。这种状况不改变，生产怎能搞得好？一九六三年初，党支部向全厂职工提出了自力更生进行技术改造，改变落后生产技术面貌的号召。
    但是，这时候厂里出现了两种不同的反应。大部分职工主张用自力更生办法来进行技术改造，他们说：“上级重视我们，大厂也帮助我们，这是好条件，但翻身还得要靠自己争气。”有少数人却产生了依赖上级的思想，他们说：“等着吧，不用咱们费劲，到时候就能穿着白罩衫，戴着白手套，在新设备上干活了。”有人怀疑说：电镀这行业，多少年来就是这么干的，凭咱们这摊子人马，要啥没啥，能改得了？
    工厂党支部认为这是两种思想的斗争在新的条件下的反映，确定先不谈具体的技术改造问题，先坐下来好好学习学习毛主席有关自力更生的论述，批驳了单纯依靠上级、依靠大厂的“两靠”思想。老工人崔连隆说：“不怕落后，就怕志短；只要我们有一股子革命干劲，就没有干不成的事情！”共产党员、机修工人赵和泰说：“愚公只有一家就立志移山，我们有二百多双革命的手，二百多颗革命的心，只要肯干，一定能把技术改造好！”经过学习讨论，许多人解除了思想顾虑，坚定了信心，立志靠自己的双手摘掉技术落后的帽子。
    在工厂的电镀槽里，整天散发着毒性气体，既影响工人健康，又影响产品质量，因此，装置通风设备就成了他们进攻的第一个高地。可是横在他们面前有多少困难啊！图纸，没有！技术人员，没有！设备呢？全厂仅有一台破皮带车床、一个台钻、两把虎钳。真是困难！但是老工人赵和泰、王桂林、叶文卿，在困难面前一马当先，带头闯关。他们不懂得通风设备的结构，不会设计，就四处奔走，寻师访友，参观学习。他们研究了许多参考材料，连有关杂志的照片也不放过，想方设法设计出一种通风设备。可是，听说在外边加工要一千六百多元，大家决心节省这笔钱。他们不会划线、下料，就出去学，学回来就干，边学边干，干得热火朝天。当时正赶上春节，工人们放弃了假日的休息，赶制安装了工厂头一道用自己的双手做出来的通风设备。接着，他们在哈尔滨电表仪器厂的大力帮助下，进一步发扬艰苦奋斗的革命精神，先后又制造出十三道动力通风设备和五道自然通风设备，安装在车间里。
    尝到自力更生甜头的人们，干劲越来越大。在短时间内，三条三十米长的通风管道地沟，自己挖出来了；车间里的间壁墙，自己打起来了；十六个大型的镀槽，自己做出来了；三十多台专用设备，自己造出来了……，凡是自己能干的都自己动手干出来了。原计划五个月完成这次技术改造的任务，实际上只用五十六天；计划技术改造费三十万元，实际只用十五万三千元。技术改造后的哈尔滨银光电镀厂，面貌一新，工艺路线更合理了，操作规程和技术标准更统一了，有史以来第一次有了化验室、配料室，实现了科学生产。烟雾迷漫的车间，有了吸尘通风设备后，变得窗明几净，空气清新。
    管理工作中两条路线的斗争
    技术改造的胜利，使工厂的面貌发生了巨大的变化。这时候，企业管理上的落后现象就越来越明显了。本来“银光”是个专业性的小厂，生产比较集中，工艺比较简单，管理也不很繁杂，但是，他们盲目地模仿大厂，设立了五个股室，四个车间，实行三级管理。全厂职工只有二百名，光脱产干部就有三十六名，占职工总数的百分之十八。机构重叠，互相牵扯，办事手续繁杂，不但束缚了工人的积极性，也捆住了领导干部的手脚。他们整天浮在上面下不去，干部参加劳动的决定也执行得不好。
    怎样改进管理工作呢？人们的思想又出现了分歧。有人认为生产发展了，管理部门就得增加人；有些人怕精简管理机构以后人少事多工作吃累，干不好；有的怕降低职位，“大材小用”；有的怕下车间劳动干活不顶个，减少收入，因此他们都反对简化管理机构。但是多数人认为应当彻底改革机构，打破阻碍生产发展的旧框框、旧思想和旧作风，来一场管理工作大革命。
    靠谁办企业，是靠工人群众，还是仅仅靠少数领导人？怎样管生产，是单纯靠机构、制度去管去卡，还是靠充分调动全体职工的积极性？干部是人民的勤务员，还是当官做老爷？管理机构是管卡生产的，还是为生产服务？工厂党支部尖锐地提出了这些问题，组织职工展开讨论。经过学习和讨论，在干部思想上集中地解决了三个问题：第一，当干部不是当“官”而是干革命，革命干部应当能上能下，能“文”能“武”；第二，管理机构对基层不应当“管”字当头，应当为生产服务；第三，领导干部和管理人员不能脱离劳动，脱离群众，应当通过劳动，管好生产，既是管理者，又是生产者。所有这些，都是革命干部永不变质的根本保证。
    运用毛泽东思想解开干部思想上的疙瘩以后，他们从本厂的实际情况出发，建立起“工作三条线，领导面对面，服务到一线”的新型管理制度，实行两级管理。工厂领导干部和管理干部分别抓政治思想、生产技术、后勤供应三条线，服务到班组，工作到班组。
    管理革命使这个厂的管理队伍精干有力了。脱产干部由三十六名减少到十一名，由占职工总数的百分之十八减少到只占百分之三点七五。
    管理工作上的革命，使干部摆脱了不少烦琐的事务，为蹲点劳动创造了条件。厂级干部半日工作、半日劳动，一般干部每周参加劳动两三天。支部书记张立业同志，一九六五年里到外面开会占去了不少时间。可是他每次开会回来就马上坚持半日劳动，并争取补上开会时耽误的劳动日。这一年，他共参加劳动九十五天。
    管理工作上的革命，充分调动了工人参加企业管理的积极性。过去，基层的日常管理工作都是由专职干部做的；现在，由工人自己负责了。每个生产工组和辅助工组都分别设立了工管员，厂部设立专职干部和群众结合的管理小组，形成了一个群众性的管理系统。全厂有百分之五十八的工人参加各种管理工作，总人数达一百四十五人，每天都准确及时地完成小组的生产统计、劳动工资、材料消耗等项的记录、核算工作。有人问他们：“你们厂的脱产干部只有百分之三点七五，怎么能管得过来呢？”这个厂的领导同志说：“我们就是这样靠大家来管理，靠群众办企业！”
    实行管理工作革命以后，这个厂还试行了工人同干部轮流换岗的作法。从一九六四年下半年到现在，全厂十一名干部已经分三批轮换了六名。“换岗”——干部在一定时期内下去当工人，改造思想，学会技术，向知识分子劳动化前进。“换岗”——部分有条件的工人，在一定时期内参加管理工作，增强全局观点，学会管理本领，为逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别找到了一条途径。
    目前，银光电镀厂正在严格地用两分法总结工作，揭露矛盾，大找差距。他们看到，同大庆人的革命精神对照，在领导革命化、职工革命化、企业革命化等方面还有很大的差距，在生产上也还有不少问题。今后的道路怎么走？他们回答是：不能躺在成绩上睡大觉，还要鼓足干劲往前赶、往前超；远景无限好，奋力争上游，决心在新的一年里坚持突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，使各项工作取得更大的成绩。
