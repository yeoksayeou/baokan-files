    The Thai People's Armed Forces Bravely Strike the Enemy in Anti-"Encirclement and Suppression" Battles
    The Thai Reactionary Military and Police Under the Command of U.S. Imperialism Are Ambushed, Suffering Heavy Casualties and Scrambling to Escape
    "Voice of the People of Thailand" Condemns Thanom's Collusion with the Vientiane Authorities to Intensify Service to U.S. Imperialist Aggression
    Xinhua News Agency, March 3rd: Bangkok News: According to a recent broadcast by the "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station, the Thai Thanom-Praphas reactionary government, under the joint planning of U.S. imperialism, carried out a large-scale armed suppression of the patriotic people's armed forces in Phun Thong District, Na Kae County, Nakhon Phanom Province, in northeastern Thailand from the end of 1965 to January 1966.
    The radio station said that the Thanom-Praphas reactionary government dispatched approximately 2,000 personnel, including the air force, cavalry, airborne police, border patrol police, "Homeland Defense Volunteer Corps," and other armed forces, and under the participation and planning of American advisors, launched an "encirclement and suppression" campaign against Phun Thong District, Na Kae County, starting on December 26 of last year. Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Praphas personally commanded the operation from the "encirclement and suppression headquarters" established in Phun Thong Village.
    The radio station said that in addition to laying landmines on every path in the mountainous areas, the reactionary military and police of the Thanom-Praphas government also indiscriminately bombed and strafed the mountainous areas from the air, dropping no fewer than one hundred bombs, causing casualties to many innocent residents in the mountainous areas.
    The radio station also said that after the bombing, the reactionary military and police used helicopters to transport heavy machine guns and mortars to occupy important mountain peaks, attempting to encircle the people's armed forces. However, they were met with courageous and flexible counterattacks and ambushes by the people's armed forces, suffering casualties. Some military and police even scrambled to escape during the battles, stepping on their own landmines, resulting in multiple casualties. The air force also mistakenly identified military and police as the people's armed forces during the chaos, strafing and bombing them, killing and wounding many military and police personnel.
    The radio station said that under the strikes of the patriotic people's armed forces, the reactionary military and police were terrified. U.S. imperialism and the Thanom-Praphas traitorous clique suffered a greater defeat in this "encirclement and suppression" campaign than in any previous one.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th: Bangkok News: The "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station pointed out on the 1st that the so-called "Joint Communiqué" recently issued by the Thai reactionary government and the Vientiane regime is another step by the United States and its lackeys to intensify aggression in Indochina, which will bring more serious disasters to the people of Thailand and Laos.
    Thai Prime Minister Thanom recently spent four days in Vientiane, holding "talks" with Prince Souvanna Phouma, General Ouane Rattikone, Commander-in-Chief of the Lao right-wing army, and others. A "Joint Communiqué" issued after the "talks" stated that the "only way" to solve the Lao problem is for the parties concerned to "faithfully" and "correctly" implement the 1962 Geneva Accords.
    The radio station said that as soon as the 1962 Geneva Accords were signed, U.S. imperialism openly violated the Geneva Accords and interfered in Lao affairs.
    The American running dogs in Thailand, Sarit, Thanom, and Praphas, have also been serving U.S. aggression and interference in Laos, providing Thailand to the United States as a base for aggression against Laos.
    The radio station concluded by saying that the above-mentioned reactionary measures of the United States and its running dogs will inevitably be severely punished by the people of Thailand and Laos.

    泰国人民武装在反“围剿”战斗中英勇打击敌人
    美帝国主义指挥下的泰国反动军警遭到伏击伤亡惨重争相逃命
    “泰国人民之声”谴责他侬同万象当局加紧勾结为美帝侵略效劳
    新华社三日讯　曼谷消息：据“泰国人民之声”电台最近广播，泰国他侬—巴博反动政府在美帝国主义共同策划下，从一九六五年底到一九六六年一月，对东北部那空拍侬府那家县喷东区的爱国人民武装力量进行了大规模的武装镇压。
    电台说，他侬—巴博反动政府出动了包括空军、骑兵、空降警察、边防警察、“保卫国土志愿队”以及其他武装等约两千人，在美国顾问的参与和策划下，从去年十二月二十六日开始对那家县喷东区展开了“围剿”。泰国副总理兼内政部长巴博亲自在喷东村建立的“围剿指挥部”进行指挥。
    电台说，他侬—巴博政府的反动军警除了在山区每条通道埋设地雷外，空军还在山区滥肆轰炸和扫射，投掷炸弹不下一百枚，使山区不少无辜居民遭到伤亡。
    电台还说，经过轰炸后，反动军警以直升飞机运送重机枪、迫击炮占据重要山头，企图包围人民武装力量。但是，他们遭到人民武装英勇、灵活的反击和伏击，遭受伤亡。还有一些军警在战斗中争相逃命，踩上自己埋下的地雷，造成多人伤亡。空军在混乱中也误把军警当成人民武装，进行扫射和轰炸，不少军警被炸死炸伤。
    电台说，在爱国人民武装的打击下，反动军警丧魂落魄。美帝国主义和他侬—巴博卖国集团在这次“围剿”中遭到了比任何一次更大的溃败。
    据新华社四日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台一日指出，泰国反动政府和万象政权最近发表的所谓“联合公报”，是美国及其仆从为加紧侵略印度支那的又一个步骤，它将给泰国人民和老挝人民带来更为严重的灾祸。
    泰国总理他侬最近去万象活动了四天，同富马亲王、老挝右派军队总司令温·拉迪功等举行了“会谈”。“会谈”后发表的一个“联合公报”说什么解决老挝问题的“唯一途径”是由有关方面“忠实”和“正确”地执行一九六二年日内瓦协议。
    电台说，一九六二年日内瓦协议刚签订，美帝国主义就公然破坏日内瓦协议，干涉老挝事务。
    美国在泰国的走卒沙立、他侬、巴博也一直为美国侵略和干涉老挝效劳，把泰国提供给美国作为侵略老挝的基地。
    电台最后说，美国及其走狗的上述反动措施，必将遭到泰国人民和老挝人民严厉的惩罚。
