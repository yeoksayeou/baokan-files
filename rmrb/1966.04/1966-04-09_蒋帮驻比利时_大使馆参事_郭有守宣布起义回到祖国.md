    Guo Youshou, "Counselor of the Embassy" of the Chiang Kai-shek Clique in Belgium, Announces Uprising and Returns to the Motherland
    He issued a statement describing his resolute return to the country based on his understanding, hoping that colleagues and friends in Taiwan and overseas would recognize the overall situation and return in righteous uprising.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Guo Youshou, "Counselor of the Embassy" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique in Belgium, resolutely broke away from the Chiang gang, announced his uprising, and returned to the motherland.
    Wang Bingnan, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, met and hosted a luncheon for him and his family after his arrival in Beijing. Xie Li, Director of the Department of Western European Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Guo Youshou's wife, Yang Yunhui, and his friends in Beijing, including Hu Zi'ang, Liu Kaiqu, Yang Gongshu, Xie Shuying, Sun Shiyi, and Qian Nengxin, welcomed Mr. Guo Youshou at the airport upon his arrival.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th: Guo Youshou, "Counselor of the Embassy" of the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique in Belgium, issued a statement after returning to the motherland. The full text of the statement is as follows:
    I have returned to the embrace of my beloved motherland with infinite guilt but also with extreme excitement. The guilt stems from my following the beaten track and hesitation since the founding of the People's Republic of China, a regret of a patriotic later generation. The excitement stems from the good fortune of finally seeing the revitalized motherland with my own eyes and reuniting with my family and friends whom I have been separated from for many years.
    The unification and prosperity of the motherland is my long-cherished wish. Therefore, I have sought temporary ease abroad for more than ten years, originally intending to contribute a modest effort to the unification of the motherland and hoping that the Chiang gang would repent and peacefully unify the motherland. However, witnessing the increasingly rampant anti-China activities of American imperialism and the Chiang bandits' intensified collaboration with the enemy, and especially seeing the sinister intentions of American imperialism in playing the "two Chinas" scheme, attempting to permanently occupy our territory of Taiwan and obstruct China's unification, I deeply understand that to achieve China's unification, we must rely on the entire Chinese people and resolutely fight against American imperialism. The people of the new China under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party are fully determined and capable of repelling American imperialism's aggression, and will certainly liberate Taiwan and ultimately rescue the Taiwan compatriots from their dire situation. My resolute return to the country this time is based on this understanding. I am unwilling to continue to follow the beaten track and err, and become a sinner of the nation. If this action can help my colleagues and friends in Taiwan and overseas recognize the overall situation and return in righteous uprising, I would be extremely hopeful and fortunate.

    蒋帮驻比利时“大使馆参事”
    郭有守宣布起义回到祖国
    他发表声明叙述自己毅然返国的认识，希望台湾及海外同僚知友，认清大局，凛然起义归来。
    新华社八日讯　台湾蒋介石集团驻比利时“大使馆参事”郭有守毅然脱离蒋帮，宣布起义，回到祖国。
    外交部副部长王炳南在他到京后，曾接见并设便宴招待他和他的家属。郭有守先生在抵达北京机场时，外交部西欧司司长谢黎、郭有守先生的夫人杨云慧以及他在京的友人胡子昂、刘开渠、杨公庶、谢树英、孙师毅、钱能欣等曾到机场欢迎。
    新华社八日讯　台湾蒋介石集团驻比利时“大使馆参事”郭有守在他回到祖国以后，发表了一项声明。声明全文如下：
    我怀着无限内疚但又万分兴奋的心情回到了亲爱的祖国怀抱。所以内疚系基于中华人民共和国成立以来，自己因循、徘徊，爱国后人，所以兴奋系庆幸终于亲眼看到万象更新的祖国，并和阔别多年的家室、亲友团聚。
    祖国统一富强系我之夙愿，所以苟安国外十余年，原图对祖国统一略尽棉薄，并幻望蒋帮悔悟，和平统一祖国。但目睹美帝国主义反华日益猖狂，蒋贼附敌变本加厉。而美帝国主义玩弄“两个中国”的阴谋，企图永远霸占我国的领土台湾，阻挠中国统一，其居心尤其险恶。深知欲图中国统一，唯有依靠全中国人民，坚决与美帝国主义搏斗，而在毛主席和共产党领导下的新中国人民，完全有决心、有力量打退美帝国主义的侵略，一定要解放台湾，最后解救台湾同胞于水深火热。本人这次毅然返国即基于这种认识，不愿再因循自误，沦为民族的罪人。此举如能有助我台湾及海外同僚知友，认清大局，凛然起义归来，则不胜企望庆幸之至。
