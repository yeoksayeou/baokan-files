    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 17th (Dispatch) – It was announced here on the evening of the 17th that the military and civilians of North Vietnam fiercely attacked intruding American planes on the 17th. Preliminary reports indicate that three enemy planes were shot down.

    The Vietnamese People's Air Force struck again on the 17th and shot down an intruding American jet fighter over Thanh Hoa Province. The military and civilians of Ha Tinh Province also shot down two enemy planes and captured an American pilot alive.

    In other news, the military and civilians of Quang Binh Province shot down an American jet fighter on the 16th.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi (Dispatch) – It was announced here on the 15th that the military and civilians of Hanoi shot down an American unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft over the outskirts of Hanoi on the afternoon of the 15th.

    This is the 18th American unmanned high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft shot down by the military and civilians of North Vietnam.

    On the 14th, American bandit planes bombed and strafed residential areas in Ha Tinh Province, North Vietnam. The local military and civilians shot down an American jet fighter on the spot.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi (Dispatch) – It was announced here on the evening of the 16th that American bandits dispatched planes to attack the southern regions of Nam Ha Province, North Vietnam, on the afternoon of the 15th. The local military and civilians shot down an American fighter plane.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 18th (Dispatch) – The Vietnamese newspaper "People's Daily" published a commentary on the 18th, calling on the military and civilians of North Vietnam to firmly grip the guns in their hands and smash the new war "escalation" plot of American imperialism.

    The commentary said that after American imperialism used B-52 strategic bombers to bomb the territory of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it sent planes on the 17th to bomb a residential area in the suburbs of Hanoi, the city of Phu Ly in Nam Ha Province, a residential area in Hai Duong Province, and other places.

    The commentary pointed out that this is a series of adventurous war actions by American imperialism and is part of its new "escalation" plan. American imperialism vainly attempts to salvage its increasingly disastrous military and political failures in the South, dreaming of shaking the Vietnamese people's iron will to resist American aggression, save the nation, defend the North, and liberate the South by intensifying the bombing of the North.

    The commentary said that, however, the criminal actions of American imperialism will only further arouse the Vietnamese people's hatred for it and strengthen their determination to eliminate it. The more American imperialism "escalates," the more disastrous failures it will inevitably suffer.

    The commentary said that no matter what kind of modern weapons, no matter what insidious and vicious means, cannot save American imperialism from failure. The Vietnamese people are determined to give American imperialism more heavy blows.

    越南人民空军腾空迎战击落美机一架
    河内和广平等省军民四天击落美国强盗飞机六架
    越南《人民报》指出美帝越是“升级”就必遭更惨重失败
    新华社河内十七日电　据这里十七日晚上公布：越南北方军民十七日痛击来犯美机，据初步消息，击落敌机三架。
    越南人民空军十七日再度出击，在清化省上空击落来犯的美国喷气式飞机一架。河静省军民也击落敌机两架，并活捉美国飞行员。
    另据补充消息，广平省军民在十六日击落了美国喷气式飞机一架。
    新华社河内电　据这里十五日公布，河内市军民十五日下午击落侵入河内市郊区上空的美国无人驾驶高空侦察机一架。
    这是越南北方军民击落的第十八架美国无人驾驶高空侦察机。
    美国强盗飞机十四日轰炸、扫射越南北方河静省的一些居民区。当地军民当场击落美国喷气式飞机一架。
    新华社河内电　据这里十六日晚上公布，美国强盗十五日下午派遣飞机袭击越南北方南河省南部地区。当地军民击落美国战斗机一架。
    新华社河内十八日电　越南《人民报》十八日发表评论，号召北方军民紧握手中枪，粉碎美帝国主义的新的战争“升级”阴谋。
    评论说，美帝国主义在用B—52型战略轰炸机轰炸越南民主共和国领土后，十七日又派飞机轰炸河内市郊的一个居民区和南河省府里市、海阳省的一个居民区和其他一些地方。
    评论指出，这是美帝国主义的一系列冒险的战争行动，是它的新“升级”计划的组成部分。美帝国主义妄图挽救它在南方的军事和政治上的日益惨重的失败，梦想用加强轰炸北方来动摇越南人民抗美救国、保卫北方和解放南方的钢铁意志。
    评论说，但是，美帝国主义的罪恶行为只会更加激起越南人民对它的仇恨和增强消灭它的决心。美帝国主义越“升级”，就必定遭到更加惨重的失败。
    评论说，无论什么样的现代化武器，无论什么阴险毒辣的手段，都不能挽救美帝国主义的失败。越南人民决心给予美帝国主义以更多的沉重打击。
