    What is the Mystery Behind the Transformation of the Image of Hai Rui?
    Wang Tu
    If we pay attention, we can discover that from Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" in June 1959 to the publication of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" with a preface added in August 1961, the image of Hai Rui in Comrade Wu Han's writing underwent corresponding changes along with the political situation of class struggle at that time.
    Around June 1959, when right-leaning opportunists were brewing undercurrents of anti-Party and anti-socialist sentiment, Comrade Wu Han took the lead and threw out "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," insidiously calling on people to "scold," fanning the flames and cheering, creating an atmosphere for the attack of the right-leaning opportunists. The image of Hai Rui in this article was very spirited, a heroic image of a great victory of "scolding the emperor very happily." The emperor who was "scolded" not only could not do anything to him, but after being imprisoned for two months, "he returned to his original post as the principal of the Ministry of Revenue," because "everywhere there were people who scolded the emperor and sympathized with and supported him." At this time, Comrade Wu Han did not mention his "dismissal from office" at all.
    Two months later, at the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party held in August 1959, the anti-Party and anti-socialist features of the right-leaning opportunists were exposed. Comrade Wu Han immediately threw out his "On Hai Rui." In this article, the focus of his description of Hai Rui underwent a rapid change: First, he used a lot of ink to highlight Hai Rui's achievements, highlighting Hai Rui's heroic image as a people's "savior" who "pleaded for the people"; second, he fanatically promoted Hai Rui's "opposition to bad people and bad deeds," "opposition to hypocrites," "not bowing his head," "not being afraid of setbacks," and "indomitable fighting spirit," praising him as a "man of integrity"; third, he advocated that "we should affirm and praise him," "we need Hai Rui today." The image of Hai Rui in this article was no longer the Hai Rui who "scolded very happily" in Comrade Wu Han's writing two months ago, but the Hai Rui who "suffered attacks, exclusion, insults, was imprisoned, and lost his official position," and was full of resentment: "What career can be accomplished in such a world!"
    The fact that the image of Hai Rui in Comrade Wu Han's writing changed so much in just two months reflects the changing process of the right-leaning opportunists from preparing to launch a major attack on the Party to being quickly exposed and criticized.
    After the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee, those right-leaning opportunists who insisted on opposing the Party and socialism continued to be deeply criticized and "dismissed" from "office." Comrade Wu Han once again stepped forward and began writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" at the end of 1959.
    The Hai Rui in this play is portrayed as a heroic image of a creator of history, a "tragic hero." "Not yielding to the powerful, not being frightened by failure, and doing it again after failure" to "make decisions for the people" (returning land, redressing unjust cases, etc.) is the consistent action of this character; the "tragic" ending of being dismissed from office for "making decisions for the people" constitutes the theme of this play. "In this struggle, Hai Rui lost his official position, but he did not give in or lose heart," expressing the author's sympathy and praise for this "hero."
    By 1961, when our country encountered temporary difficulties, the right-leaning opportunists believed that the time had come again, and once again came out in droves and engaged in large-scale activities, Comrade Wu Han finally completed the shaping of the image of Hai Rui. Thus, a Hai Rui who protested "dismissal from office," hated "dismissal from office," and even if he was "dismissed" from "office," he would never give up, but would accumulate strength and wait for an opportunity to make a comeback, finally "broke" through the door of history and climbed onto the stage.
    Are all these just accidental coincidences? We say that the process of shaping the image of Hai Rui in Comrade Wu Han's writing reflects and closely cooperates with the process of the right-leaning opportunists attacking, failing, and attempting to attack the Party again; the image of Hai Rui is like the beautified face of the right-leaning opportunists decorated with the mask of "honest officials"; and the feudal restorationist ideological toxins and bourgeois reactionary historical idealism promoted through "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are also timely cooperating with the needs of the bourgeoisie, feudal forces, and all monsters and demons in opposing Marxism, opposing the Party, and opposing socialism. Isn't this in line with objective facts?
    With the repeated class struggles in socialist society, with the in-depth development of the socialist revolution and the deep-rootedness of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, all those who oppose Marxism-Leninism, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose the socialist revolution have also adopted new struggle methods. That is: they use Marxist words to disguise their anti-Marxist ideological essence, and use the rhetoric of loving the people and loving the culture and history of the motherland to disguise their anti-socialist political stance. "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a concentrated expression of this anti-Marxist and anti-socialist ideological trend in drama.

    海瑞形象变化的奥妙何在？
    王涂
    如果我们注意一下，就可发现，从一九五九年六月的《海瑞骂皇帝》到一九六一年八月加序出版的《海瑞罢官》，吴晗同志笔下的海瑞形象，随着当时阶级斗争的政治形势的推移也发生了相应的变化。
    一九五九年六月间，当右倾机会主义分子正在酝酿反党、反社会主义的潜流的时候，吴晗同志一马当先，抛出了《海瑞骂皇帝》，含沙射影地号召人们“骂”，煽风点火，呐喊助威，给右倾机会主义分子的进攻制造一种气氛。这篇文章里的海瑞形象，神气得很，是一个骂皇帝“骂得非常痛快”的大获全胜的英雄形象。挨了“骂”的皇帝不但奈何他不得，而且在他被关两月之后，“仍回原职，作户部主事”，由于“大骂皇帝，同情他和支持他的人到处都是”。吴晗同志在这时，根本没提到他的“罢官”的事情。
    两个月后，在一九五九年八月召开的党的八届八中全会上，揭发了右倾机会主义分子的反党反社会主义的面目。吴晗同志紧跟着就抛出了他的《论海瑞》。他在这篇文章里对海瑞的描写的侧重面，发生了急遽的变化：首先，用大量笔墨为海瑞摆功，突出海瑞作为“为民请命”的人民“救星”的英雄形象；其次，狂热地宣扬海瑞的“反对坏人坏事”、“反对乡愿”、“不低头”、“不怕挫折”、“百屈不挠的斗争精神”，称誉他是“铮铮一汉子”；第三，鼓吹“应该肯定，应该歌颂”，“我们今天需要的海瑞”。这篇文章里海瑞的形象已经不是吴晗同志笔下两个月前“骂得非常痛快”的海瑞，而是“遭受攻击，排挤，辱骂，坐过牢，丢过官”的海瑞了，并且怨气冲天：“这等世界，做得成什么事业！”
    在短短两个月内，吴晗同志笔下的海瑞形象变化这样大，正是反映了右倾机会主义分子从着手准备大举向党进攻到迅速被揭露批判的变化过程。
    八届八中全会以后，那些坚持反党、反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子继续受到深入地批判，“罢”了“官”。吴晗同志再一次挺身而出，于一九五九年底开始了《海瑞罢官》的创作。
    这个剧本里的海瑞被描绘成一个历史创造者的英雄形象，一个“悲剧英雄”的形象。“不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干”地去“为民作主”（退田、平冤狱等等），是这个人物的一贯行动；由于“为民作主”而遭到罢官的“悲剧”结局，则构成了这出戏的主题。“在这场斗争中，海瑞丢了官，但他并不屈服，不丧气”，表现了作者对这个“英雄”的同情和赞歌。
    到了一九六一年，当我国遇到了暂时的困难，右倾机会主义分子认为时机又到，再一次纷纷出笼，大肆活动的时候，吴晗同志终于最后完成了对于海瑞形象的塑造。于是，一个抗议“罢官”，仇恨“罢官”，“罢”了“官”也决不善罢干休，还要积蓄力量，俟机东山再起的海瑞，终于“破”历史之门而出，爬上了舞台。
    所有这一切，难道都是偶然的巧合吗？我们说，吴晗同志笔下海瑞形象的塑造过程，正是反映并密切配合了右倾机会主义分子向党进攻、失败和妄图再进攻的过程；海瑞的形象正象被美化了的、并用“清官”脸谱装饰起来的右倾机会主义分子的嘴脸；而通过《海瑞罢官》所宣扬的封建复古主义的思想毒素和资产阶级反动的唯心史观，也正是及时地配合了资产阶级、封建势力以及一切牛鬼蛇神反对马克思主义、反对党、反对社会主义的斗争需要。这难道不是切合客观的事实吗？
    随着社会主义社会的阶级斗争的几番反复，随着社会主义革命的深入发展和马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的深入人心，一切反对马克思列宁主义、反对毛泽东思想、反对社会主义革命的人们也采取了新的斗争手法。那就是：他们用马克思主义的词句来掩饰他们的反马克思主义的思想本质，用爱人民爱祖国文化历史的词藻来掩饰他们的反社会主义的政治立场。《海瑞罢官》正是这种反马克思主义、反社会主义思潮在戏剧上的一个集中表现。
