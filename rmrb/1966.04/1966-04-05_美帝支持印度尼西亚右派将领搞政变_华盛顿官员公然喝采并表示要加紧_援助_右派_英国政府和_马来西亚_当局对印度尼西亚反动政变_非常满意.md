    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th—The military coup launched by the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique has received cheers and support from the United States, Britain, and "Malaysia."

    The day after Indonesian Army Commander Suharto took over governmental power, U.S. Ambassador to Jakarta, Green, told a U.S. broadcasting company reporter on the phone on March 12th that the Indonesian political disputes were being handled in a "peaceful and good way." Green also said that he expected the new military authorities to take action against leftists.

    Former U.S. Ambassador to Jakarta, Jones, on March 13th described Suharto's takeover of power as "a reasonable action to maintain law and order." He was particularly satisfied with the fact that Suharto "is a strong anti-communist figure."

    State Department spokesman McCloskey told reporters on March 14th, when asked about whether to give Indonesia "economic aid," that the United States "has never ruled out restoring aid to Indonesia, either now or ever." The USIS said in a message on the same day, "Regarding aid to Indonesia, other U.S. officials pointed out that the United States has never ruled out the possibility of resuming such aid someday."

    *New York Times* reporter Frankel wrote in a report from Washington on March 13th entitled "Indonesia's Takeover is Welcomed by the United States" that "News from Indonesia indicates that Sukarno's political life is dead, and the Johnson administration yesterday found it difficult to conceal its delight at these news." The report said, "Officials, after engaging in long and patient diplomacy to help the army defeat the Communists and maintaining months of cautious silence as Sukarno appeared to be declining, are gleefully finding their expectations realized." The report also said that U.S. officials are now "still reluctant to make public comments that might embarrass the budding army leaders. They are already turning to consider how to rescue Indonesia with economic aid." The U.S. *Christian Science Monitor* also said in an article on March 16th that the U.S.'s "official reaction to the dramatic changes in Indonesia is cautiously optimistic. It has not ruled out resuming American aid at some point in the future." U.S. officials "cannot restrain a certain degree of optimism, although they want to restrain it as much as possible."

    An Associated Press dispatch from Singapore on March 13th stated that "The new military regime in Indonesia has announced that its foreign policy will be 'anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist,' and generally anti-Western." "The statement by Suharto, the new military strongman, also declared that President Sukarno's 'Crush Malaysia' campaign will continue... But Western diplomatic experts here are not overly disturbed by this statement. They believe this is mainly for domestic consumption."
  “They cannot suddenly make a 180-degree change; these people's actions are cunning and cautious.”

    A United Press International dispatch from Washington on March 12th stated that Indonesian military leaders have announced a ban on the Indonesian Communist Party, "If this further prevents it (the Indonesian Communist Party) from influencing national policy, it would be beneficial to the United States."

    An editorial in *The New York Times* on March 13th repeatedly cheered Suharto's takeover of power. The editorial said, "A particularly encouraging circumstance in the new regime is that the ousted Defense Minister Nasution will probably assume important responsibilities."

    The editorial said, "Indonesia possesses vast undeveloped resources and is the wealthiest, most populous, and strategically most valuable country in Southeast Asia." The United States hopes that Indonesia will "resolve the dispute with Malaysia" through "negotiations" and "from such a solution may eventually establish the long-planned Maphilindo Federation with the Filipinos and establish a new peaceful alliance in one of the world's most turbulent regions."

    An article in the *Washington Evening Star* on March 13th also happily said, "Suharto is in control," "From the Western point of view, this can only be a welcome situation."

    British officials and newspapers also expressed happiness and hope about Suharto's takeover of power. British Prime Minister Wilson, who was campaigning in Scotland, immediately spoke with Foreign Secretary Stewart by telephone for ten minutes on this issue after hearing the news of Suharto's takeover of power on March 12th. Subsequently, Stewart issued a statement on March 14th saying that if any government in Indonesia seeks to "live in peace" with "Malaysia" and its other neighbors, they can obtain this because its neighbors and Britain have "sincerity." He also said that Britain is prepared to see Indonesia play a "leading role" in Southeast Asia commensurate with its large population and resources.

    British High Commissioner to "Malaysia," Walker, said in Kuala Lumpur on March 14th that the Indonesian army's takeover of power in a "very satisfactory" and "peaceful" manner has "important significance." He said, "General Suharto, the Indonesian Minister of the Army, taking a firm anti-communist policy is a very healthy sign, which may mean the beginning of an improvement in the political situation in the region." Walker also said, "If the Indonesian side is willing to hold negotiations on the issue of confrontation, the British and Malaysian governments will be interested."

    An editorial in the influential British newspaper *The Times* on March 14th praised Suharto's takeover of power. The editorial said that Indonesia can now "hope to change" its anti-imperialist stance.

    An editorial in *The Daily Telegraph* on the same day said, "The new regime may devote all its energy to crushing Indonesian communism. This will also eliminate the most dangerous element in the Confrontation policy."

    The newspaper's editorial on March 22nd also praised Suharto, saying: "In the eleven days since Suharto took over power in Indonesia, he has increasingly proven that he is trustworthy."

    The Rahman clique also expressed happiness about the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces taking over power. According to a Singaporean newspaper report on March 13th, "Malaysia" Prime Minister Rahman said on March 12th that the situation in Indonesia was "encouraging," "The true nationalists have seized power from the pro-communist clique."

    According to a United Press International report from Kuala Lumpur, "Malaysia" Deputy Prime Minister Razak said at the annual meeting of the United Malays National Organisation on March 13th that Suharto's control of power in Indonesia was "a great victory for anti-communist forces," "'Malaysia' warmly welcomes the emergence of an anti-communist regime in Jakarta and the banning of the Indonesian Communist Party." He also said that he hoped that the Confrontation will "cease" and that the relationship between "Malaysia" and Indonesia will be restored.

    美帝支持印度尼西亚右派将领搞政变
    华盛顿官员公然喝采并表示要加紧“援助”右派  英国政府和“马来西亚”当局对印度尼西亚反动政变“非常满意”
    新华社四日讯  印度尼西亚右派将领集团发动的军事政变，得到了美国、英国和“马来西亚”的喝采和支持。
    在印度尼西亚陆军司令苏哈托接管政府权力的次日，美国驻雅加达大使格林三月十二日在电话中对美国广播公司记者说，印度尼西亚的政治纠纷正在以“和平和良好的方式”加以处理。格林还说，他预料新的军事当局将对左派分子采取行动。
    前美国驻雅加达大使琼斯三月十三日把苏哈托接管政权说成是“维护法律和秩序的一个合理行动”。他对苏哈托“是一个强烈的反共人物”这一点特别感到满意。
    国务院发言人麦克洛斯基三月十四日对记者谈到是否给予印度尼西亚以“经济援助”的问题时说，美国“从未在现在或永远地排除恢复对印度尼西亚的援助”。美新处同一天在一条消息里说，“关于给印度尼西亚的援助，美国其他官员指出，美国从未排除过有朝一日恢复这种援助的可能性。”
    《纽约时报》记者弗兰克尔三月十三日从华盛顿发出的一篇题为《印度尼西亚的接管受到美国的欢迎》的报道露骨地说，“印度尼西亚传来的消息说明苏加诺的政治生命已经死亡，约翰逊政府昨天感到很难掩饰它对这些消息的高兴。”报道说，“官员们在为了帮助陆军战胜共产党人进行了长期耐心的外交活动，并在苏加诺显得走下坡时保持几个月的审慎的沉默后，洋洋得意地发现他们的期望实现了。”报道还说，美国官员现在“仍然不愿发表可能使正在露头角的陆军领导感到难堪的公开评论。他们已经在转而考虑如何用经济援助拯救印度尼西亚。”美国《基督教科学箴言报》三月十六日在一篇文章中也说，美国“对印度尼西亚的剧烈变动的官方反应是谨慎的乐观。没有排除在今后某个时候恢复美国的援助”。美国官员们“不能克制一定的乐观情绪，尽管他们想尽量克制”。
    美联社三月十三日从新加坡发出的消息说，“印度尼西亚新军人政权宣布，它的外交政策将是‘反资本主义、反帝国主义’和一般地反西方的。”“新的军方有力人物苏哈托的声明还宣布苏加诺总统的‘粉碎马来西亚’运动将继续进行……但是这里西方外交专家们并没有由于这种说法而过分不安。他们认为这主要是说给国内的人们听的。”
  “他们不能够突然来个一百八十度的改变，这些人的行动是狡猾和谨慎的。”
    合众国际社三月十二日从华盛顿发出的消息说，印度尼西亚军事头目已经宣布禁止印度尼西亚共产党，“如果这进一步使它（印度尼西亚共产党）不能对国家政策发生影响的话，那对美国是有利的。”
    《纽约时报》三月十三日的社论一再为苏哈托接管政权叫好。社论说，“在新政权方面一种特别令人感到鼓舞的情况是，被黜免的国防部长纳苏蒂安大概将担负重任。”
    社论说：“印度尼西亚拥有庞大的未开发的资源，是东南亚最富裕、人口最多、位于最具有战略价值的地区的国家。”美国希望印度尼西亚将通过“谈判”来“解决同马来西亚的纠纷”，并“从这样一种解决办法中最后可能同菲律宾人建立规划已久的马菲印尼联邦，并在世界最动乱不安的地区之一建立一个新的和平联盟。”
    《华盛顿明星晚报》三月十三日发表的一篇文章也高兴地说，“苏哈托正在控制局面”，“从西方的观点来看，这只能是一种值得欢迎的情况”。
    英国官方和报刊对苏哈托接管政权也表示高兴并且寄予希望。正在苏格兰从事竞选活动的英国首相威尔逊三月十二日在听到苏哈托接管政权的消息后，立即同外交大臣斯图尔特用电话就这个问题交谈了十分钟。接着，斯图尔特在三月十四日发表谈话说，如果印度尼西亚任何政府谋求同“马来西亚”以及它的其它邻国“和好相处”的话，他们可以得到这一点，因为它的邻国和英国都有“诚意”。他还说，英国准备看到印度尼西亚在东南亚起到同它的众多的人口和资源相称的“领导作用”。
    英国驻“马来西亚”高级专员华尔克三月十四日在吉隆坡说，印度尼西亚陆军以“非常满意”和“和平”的方式接管政权具有“重要的意义”。他说，“印度尼西亚陆军部长苏哈托将军采取坚定的反共政策，是一种非常健康的迹象，这可能意味着本地区政治局势走向改善的开端。”华尔克还说，“如果印度尼西亚方面有意就对抗问题举行谈判，英国与马来西亚政府都将会感到兴趣”。
    英国有影响的《泰晤士报》三月十四日发表社论赞扬苏哈托接管政权。社论说，印度尼西亚现在“可望改变”反对帝国主义的立场。
    《每日电讯报》同一天的社论说，“新政权可能把精力全部用于粉碎印度尼西亚共产主义。这样也就将消灭对抗政策中的最危险的因素。”
    这家报纸三月二十二日的社论还赞扬苏哈托说：“在苏哈托在印度尼西亚接管政权后的十一天中，他越来越证明他是值得信任的。”
    拉赫曼集团也对印度尼西亚右派反动势力接管政权表示高兴。据新加坡报纸三月十三日报道，“马来西亚”总理拉赫曼三月十二日说，印度尼西亚局势“令人鼓舞”，
  “真正的国家主义分子已从亲共集团手中取得政权”。
    据合众国际社从吉隆坡报道，“马来西亚”副总理拉扎克三月十三日在马来亚民族联合机构年会上讲话时说，苏哈托在印度尼西亚掌握政权是“反共力量的巨大胜利”，
  “‘马来西亚’热烈欢迎在雅加达出现反共政权和禁止印度尼西亚共产党”。他还说，他希望对抗将“停止”，“马来西亚”同印度尼西亚的关系将会恢复。
