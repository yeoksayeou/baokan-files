    We Need This Kind of “Originality”
    Xin Wu
    The ballet “The White-Haired Girl” is a new achievement of China’s socialist Great Cultural Revolution, and it is another good model of “originality”!
    Where is the “newness”? Where is the “difference”? First, the protagonists of foreign ballets are mostly foreign talents and beauties, and the content is mostly about romance; “The White-Haired Girl” goes against this: it reflects the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people, and its protagonists are peasants and revolutionary soldiers. Second, previous ballets were all “silent”: there was dance but no singing; “The White-Haired Girl” added accompaniment singing, making the ballet “speak.” Third, ballet is a foreign dance, and its main characteristic is dancing on tiptoe. “The White-Haired Girl” preserves this characteristic of the dance, while also absorbing some expressive forms of Chinese folk dance, combining Chinese folk dance with this foreign dance. Of course, the “new” and “different” aspects are not limited to these. Just read the articles published here, and then watch the performance on stage, and you will know the details.
    After a new class steps onto the stage of history, it always wants to “innovate” in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects. For example, the European Renaissance was a “trailblazing” movement in the ideological and cultural field: it “blazed” the “newness” of capitalism and “established” the “difference” of the bourgeoisie. In our socialist Great Cultural Revolution, a trend of “originality” has also emerged. Revolutionary modern Peking Operas “The Red Lantern,” “Shajiabang,” “Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy,” and “Raid on the White Tiger Regiment,” the ballet “The Red Detachment of Women,” the symphonic music “Shajiabang,” the clay sculpture “Rent Collection Courtyard,” and the ballet “The White-Haired Girl,” which will soon be premiered in Beijing, are all models of “originality.” However, the name is the same but the reality is different. What we “blaze” is the “newness” of socialism, and what we “establish” is the “difference” of the proletariat. This kind of "originality" is the most revolutionary and thorough "originality" in the history of human art. It is fundamentally different in nature from the previous "originality" that replaced the "old" and "same" of the original exploiting class with the "new" and "different" of another exploiting class.
    If socialist literature and art do not "blaze" the "newness" of socialism, do not "establish" the "difference" of the proletariat, and only imitate the things of the ancients and foreigners, then they will not become socialist literature and art. Can literature and art that eulogize emperors, generals, talented scholars, and beautiful women, and promote feudal ethics, or literature and art that eulogize foreign talents and beauties and promote bourgeois individualism and humanitarianism, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serve socialism? Can they conduct communist education for the masses? That is absolutely impossible. These things not only cannot serve socialism, but also have the opposite effect, namely poisoning the minds of workers, peasants, and soldiers and undermining the socialist economic base, "digging at the foundations of socialism from a spiritual level." It is absolutely impossible for socialist literature and art not to "blaze" the "newness" of socialism or "establish" the "difference" of the proletariat.
    Lu Xun said: "Without a pioneer who breaks through all traditional ideas and techniques, China will not have a truly new literature and art." Today, if we want to create a new socialist literature and art, we must be pioneers of the socialist Great Cultural Revolution, dare to be "original," and dare to "break through all traditional ideas and techniques." Ballet is a foreign art form, and it has always been regarded by some as the "supreme peak of art," that cannot be touched or changed in the slightest. It is simply a "tiger's ass—untouchable." What is gratifying is that the comrades of the Shanghai Dance School, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, like the comrades engaged in the reform of Peking Opera and the creation of the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women," the symphonic music "Shajiabang," and the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard," dare to touch the "tiger's ass," dare to be "original." They can be regarded as a group of socialist pioneers.
    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" once again demonstrates the following prospect: as long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and continue to "blaze" the "newness" of socialism and continue to "establish" the "difference" of the proletariat, we will surely be able to establish the most glorious socialist new literature and art in human history!

### 要这样“标新立异”

    要这样“标新立异”
    辛午
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是我国社会主义文化大革命的一个新的成果，是又一个“标新立异”的好样板！
    “新”在哪里？“异”在何处？第一，外国芭蕾舞的主角大多是洋才子洋佳人，内容大多是谈情说爱；《白毛女》则一反其道而行之：它反映的是中国人民的革命斗争，它的主人公是农民和革命战士。第二，以往的芭蕾舞都是“不开口”的：有舞无唱；《白毛女》则加上了伴唱，使芭蕾舞“开了口”。第三，芭蕾舞是洋舞蹈，它的主要特点是用脚尖跳舞，《白毛女》保存了这种舞蹈的特点，同时吸取了我国民族舞蹈的一些表现形式，把我国民族舞蹈同这种洋舞蹈结合起来了。当然，“新”“异”之处，不止这些。只要读一读登在这里的文章，再看一看舞台上的演出，便可知底细。
    一个新生的阶级踏上历史舞台以后，总是要在政治、经济、文化等各个方面“标新立异”的。比如，欧洲文艺复兴运动，就是资产阶级在思想文化领域里一个“标新立异”的运动：“标”的是资本主义之“新”，“立”的是资产阶级之“异”。在我们的社会主义文化大革命中，也兴起了“标新立异”之风。革命现代京剧《红灯记》《沙家浜》《智取威虎山》《奇袭白虎团》，芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》，交响音乐《沙家浜》，泥塑《收租院》，以及即将在北京公演的芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，都是“标新立异”的样板。不过名同实异，我们“标”的是社会主义之“新”，“立”的是无产阶级之“异”。这种“标新立异”，在人类文艺史上是最革命最彻底的“标新立异”，它跟以往那种以另一个剥削阶级之“新”和“异”，来代替原有剥削阶级之“旧”和“同”的“标新立异”，在本质上是根本不相同的。
    社会主义的文艺，如果不“标”社会主义之“新”，不“立”无产阶级之“异”，而一味模仿古人和外国人的东西，也就不成其为社会主义的文艺了。歌颂帝王将相、才子佳人，宣扬封建道德的文艺，歌颂洋才子洋佳人，宣扬资产阶级个人主义和人道主义的文艺，能为工农兵、为社会主义服务吗？能向人民群众进行共产主义教育吗？那是绝对不能的。这些东西不但不能为社会主义服务，而且还要起相反的作用，即毒化工农兵思想和破坏社会主义经济基础，“从精神上挖社会主义的墙脚”。社会主义的文艺，不“标”社会主义之“新”，不“立”无产阶级之“异”，是万万不行的。
    鲁迅说过：“没有冲破一切传统思想和手法的闯将，中国是不会有真正的新文艺的。”今天，我们要创立社会主义的新文艺，就得当社会主义文化大革命的闯将，敢于“标新立异”，敢于“冲破一切传统思想和手法”。芭蕾舞是一种外来的艺术形式，它一直被有些人奉为“至高无上的艺术顶峰”，动不得一点，改不得一分，简直就是“老虎屁股——摸不得”。令人高兴的是，上海市舞蹈学校的同志们，在毛泽东思想武装下，跟从事京剧改革和搞芭蕾舞《红色娘子军》、交响音乐《沙家浜》、泥塑《收租院》的同志们一样，敢于摸“老虎屁股”，敢于“标新立异”，他们可算得是一群社会主义的闯将。
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》再次展示了这样的前景：只要我们更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，不断地“标”社会主义之
  “新”，不断地“立”无产阶级之“异”，我们就一定能够建立人类历史上最光辉灿烂的社会主义新文艺！
