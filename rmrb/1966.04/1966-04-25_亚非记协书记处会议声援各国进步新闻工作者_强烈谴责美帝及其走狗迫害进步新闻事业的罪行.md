    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th. The appeal from the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association is as follows:
    We, the participants of the Fourth Plenary Meeting of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association, uphold the spirit of the 1963 Jakarta Declaration. The Jakarta Declaration demands that Asian and African journalists dedicate their work and lifelong efforts to the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, to strive for thorough national independence, and to strongly oppose all forms and manifestations of fascism, including the suppression of democratic rights, discrimination based on skin color, race, etc. We note with deep concern that many progressive revolutionary journalists in Asia and Africa have been subjected to barbaric persecution, brutal killings, and imprisonment.
    We note with extreme indignation:
    1.  In Indonesia, after the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique, supported by US imperialism, seized power, it launched a nationwide terror campaign in which more than 300,000 progressives, including journalists, were killed, and hundreds of thousands more were thrown into prisons and concentration camps. All progressive newspapers and magazines were closed down, thus trampling on the fundamental elements of democratic rights.
    2.  In Ghana, after Ankrah, supported by British and American imperialism, launched a coup, progressive mass organizations were suppressed and banned, all democratic news agencies were closed down, and progressive journalists were persecuted.
    3.  In South Vietnam, under the extremely brutal rule of US imperialism and its running dogs, all democratic rights and freedoms have been deprived. Freedom of speech has been suppressed unprecedentedly. In areas temporarily occupied by the enemy, about one hundred newspapers have been banned, and hundreds of journalists have been imprisoned, tortured, or massacred, simply because they dared to tell the people the truth. At the same time, US imperialism and its lackeys have established reactionary propaganda machines to spread lies and slanders in an attempt to cover up the facts, poison public opinion, and deceive the people, thereby serving their bloody policy of aggression and war against South Vietnam.
    4.  In South Korea, the US puppet Park Chung-hee clique, in addition to banning democratic newspapers and periodicals, also cruelly persecutes progressive journalists.
    5.  In Zimbabwe, Smith's white racist regime stifles all democratic speech and expression.
    6.  In Aden, British colonialists do not allow the slightest trace of democracy, and many democratic journalists are tortured in prisons.
    7.  In other places, progressive journalists are also persecuted.
    Comrades, Colleagues! We must not ignore this challenge! We pay our highest respects to the persecuted progressive journalists.
    We call on all journalists in Asia and Africa to raise their strongest voices against these crimes committed by imperialism headed by the United States, as well as by fascists, military and racist regimes.
    We call on all journalists to mobilize all news tools to expose the reactionary nature of these regimes, and to demand the release of all democrats, including journalists, and the restoration of democratic rights.
    We are deeply convinced that the people and journalists of the above-mentioned countries, in close unity with the world's people in the anti-imperialist struggle, strengthening their multifaceted struggles, will eventually smash the current fascist and racist regimes, restore democratic rights, and ensure the success of their national democratic revolutions.

    亚非记协书记处会议声援各国进步新闻工作者
    强烈谴责美帝及其走狗迫害进步新闻事业的罪行
    新华社二十四日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的呼吁书，全文如下：
    我们，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议的参加者，坚持一九六三年《雅加达宣言》的精神。《雅加达宣言》要求亚非新闻工作者把他们的工作和毕生力量贡献给反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义、争取彻底的民族独立的斗争，并强烈反对一切形式和表现的法西斯主义，包括镇压民主权利、肤色、种族等方面的歧视。我们以深切不安的心情看到亚洲和非洲许多进步的革命的新闻工作者遭到野蛮迫害、残暴杀害和被投入监狱。
    我们以极其愤慨的心情注意到：
    一、在印度尼西亚，在美帝国主义支持下的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安的法西斯军事集团夺取政权后，发动了全国规模的恐怖运动，有三十多万进步人士包括新闻工作者在内遭到杀害，另有几十万人被投入监狱和集中营。所有进步报纸和杂志被封闭，民主权利的基本因素就是这样遭到了践踏。
    二、在加纳，在英美帝国主义支持下的安克拉发动政变后，进步的群众组织被压制和查禁，一切民主的新闻机构被封闭，进步的新闻工作者遭到迫害。
    三、在南越，在美帝国主义和它的走狗的极其残暴的统治下，剥夺了一切民主权利和自由。言论自由空前地受到压制。在敌人暂时占据的地区，大约一百家报纸被查禁，几百名新闻工作者被投入监狱、遭到酷刑或屠杀，只是因为他们敢于把事实告诉人民。同时，美帝国主义和它的仆从建立了反动的宣传机器，散布谎言和诽谤，企图掩盖事实、毒化舆论和欺骗人民，从而为他们对南越进行侵略和战争的血腥政策服务。
    四、在南朝鲜，美国傀儡朴正熙集团除了查禁民主报刊外，还残酷地迫害进步新闻工作者。
    五、在津巴布韦，史密斯的白人种族主义政权窒息了一切民主言论和表现。
    六、在亚丁，英国殖民主义者不容许存在丝毫的民主，许多民主新闻工作者在监狱中受折磨。
    七、在其他一些地方，进步新闻工作者也遭到迫害。
    同志们，同行们！决不能对这种挑战置之不理！我们对遭到迫害的进步新闻工作者致以崇高的敬意。
    我们呼吁亚洲和非洲的一切新闻工作者发出最强烈的呼声，反对以美国为首的帝国主义以及法西斯分子、军事和种族主义政权犯下的这些罪行。
    我们呼吁一切新闻工作者动员一切新闻工具来揭露这些政权的反动性，并且要求释放包括新闻工作者在内的一切民主人士，和恢复民主权利。
    我们深信，上述国家的人民和新闻工作者，在同世界人民反帝斗争的紧密联合下，加强他们的多方面的斗争，最后一定会粉碎目前的法西斯和种族主义政权，恢复民主权利，并且使他们的民族民主革命得到成功。（附图片）
    四月二十四日，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）在北京胜利闭幕。当亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多宣布会议胜利闭幕时，全场起立，热烈鼓掌。
