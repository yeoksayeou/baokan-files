    Dear Comrade Liu Shaoqi, dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, esteemed friends, ladies and gentlemen:
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi spoke with great warmth and friendship at this grand reception about the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and the government of the People's Republic of Albania. We are deeply moved and immensely pleased. These words truly express the unbreakable, fraternal, internationalist, pure, and ardent friendly feelings between our two peoples, two parties, and two governments.
    Dear comrades and friends, please allow me, on behalf of the Albanian people, the Albanian Labor Party, the government of the People's Republic of Albania, as well as our people and the leader of our party, Comrade Enver Hoxha himself, to convey unbreakable, eternal, fraternal heartfelt friendship, the warmest respect, and the best wishes to the great 700 million Chinese people, your glorious and heroic party, your government, and Comrade Mao Zedong, the greatest and dearest friend of the Albanian people. At the same time, I would like to express, on behalf of the delegation, my sincere gratitude for this such a cordial and friendly reception.
    Sino-Albanian friendship is not an abstract formula. It is the result and the most sublime expression of consistently implementing the Marxist-Leninist and proletarian internationalist principles that govern relations between socialist countries and Marxist-Leninist parties. It is the result of our two peoples' common revolutionary struggle under the leadership of Marxist-Leninist parties against imperialist occupiers, feudal landlords, capitalists, and reactionaries for national and social liberation, and for the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction in our two countries. It is the most sublime expression of our common struggle against imperialism headed by the United States, all reactionaries, and modern revisionism centered on the current Soviet leadership. We have shared weal and woe in the past and present, and are inseparable comrades-in-arms. We have always held high the pure and glorious banner of Marxist-Leninism, joining hands, and marching forward non-stop for the ultimate victory of socialism, communism, and genuine peace in our two countries and throughout the world. Our friendship is an important factor in further strengthening the socialist camp, the international workers' movement, and the communist movement, as well as the struggle of all peoples against imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism. Our two parties, as two tried and tested assault teams on the front lines of socialism and communism, feel that their internationalist duty is to constantly forge and strengthen this steel-like friendship, making it increasingly strong, powerful, and unbreakable.
    The Albanian people and their party believe that the birth of the People's Republic of China is a historic victory achieved by the great Chinese revolution under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong. This is a great fortune for the socialist camp and all of humanity, because this great event of world significance has thoroughly changed the balance of power on the international stage, making it favorable to revolution, socialism, and communism.
    In a short period of time, the People's Republic of China has become a great and powerful socialist country with a modern economy, modern science and technology, and an invincible modern defense. The weight of People's China on the world stage has reached such a point that no major international issue of any nature can be resolved without its participation. Every achievement and victory of the People's Republic of China in all fields fills the people of all countries with heartfelt joy and enrages the enemies of People's China and the enemies of all peoples – American imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism, because great People's China, with its correct and principled Marxist-Leninist policy, has today become the main and insurmountable obstacle to the US imperialism and its lackeys in their quest to dominate the world and realize their plans of aggression and plunder.
    To this day, US imperialism still forcibly occupies Taiwan, an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and its neighboring islands, strives to obstruct the restoration of the People's Republic of China's undeniable legitimate rights in the United Nations, constantly provokes the People's Republic of China, organizes aggressive treaties and establishes military bases around China, and ignites flames of war in various locations, in order to achieve its main and ultimate goal – direct aggression against the People's Republic of China.
    US imperialism, gathering mercenaries from some countries and some of the best troops and military equipment from its own country, is frantically waging war against the heroic fraternal Vietnamese people in Vietnam, at the gates of China. The Vietnamese people have seized weapons and are waging an epic war to drive the American aggressors out of South Vietnam, defend the North, and unify the indivisible motherland. Johnson's activities for a "peaceful" settlement of the Vietnam problem are a hypocritical and vicious deception. It is a futile struggle by the aggressors to escape their total isolation and to save themselves from inevitable defeat. The heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people is a great school of people's war, which exposes the myth that imperialism is invincible. The Albanian people, their party, and their government unreservedly support the struggle of the fraternal Vietnamese people and firmly believe that the Vietnamese people will surely win final victory.
    US imperialism occupies South Korea, turning it into a comprehensive military base and a place of oppression and hunger. US imperialism provokes Cambodia and Laos, instigates and supports Japanese militarism, organizes anti-people and counter-revolutionary conspiracies and wars in many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, and vigorously revives German revanchist militarism in the heart of Europe, thereby seriously threatening the freedom, independence, sovereignty, lives, and world peace of the peoples of all countries.
    Wherever the bloody hands of the American devils reach in the world, there are conspiracies, military coups, bloodshed, and the people are oppressed, exploited, and murdered. The people of all countries see these things every day and feel the indignation against these crimes from the bottom of their hearts. Precisely because of this, the people of all countries rise up against their most dangerous enemy, US imperialism, and its various lackeys. The main task of the people of the whole world is to tie up the hands and feet of US imperialism and give it the fate it deserves as soon as possible. The People's Republic of China stands at the forefront of this struggle, which is the good fortune of humanity's future. Today, the People's Republic of China is an indestructible socialist fortress, the hope, guarantee, and powerful reliance of the people of all countries struggling for freedom, independence, and economic and social progress.
    The Chinese Communist Party stands at the forefront of the struggle to defend Marxism-Leninism and oppose the products of bourgeois ideology, the main danger of modern revisionism to the international communist and workers' movement. Modern revisionists have now virtually become the running dogs and natural allies of the international bourgeoisie and imperialism.
    Modern revisionists, as servants and natural allies of the bourgeoisie, painstakingly deceive the people of all countries, blinding their eyes, making them "believe" that executioners are "humane," robbers are "kind," oppressors are "liberators," international gendarme US imperialism is "wise," and that US imperialism also "wants peace" and it is "possible to negotiate" with it. Modern revisionists are the "firefighters" of imperialism, trying their best to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the people of all countries. Modern revisionists are willing saboteurs of imperialism behind the socialist, Marxist-Leninist front, inside the socialist camp, and in the international communist movement. Playing this inglorious role as the greatest betrayal in human history, they concentrate their main attack on the main fortress of socialism and the standard-bearer of Marxism-Leninism, the People's Republic of China and the Chinese Communist Party.
    They engage in blatant demagogy, clamoring for "unity" within the socialist camp and the international communist movement. However, the purpose of modern revisionism is not unity, but division; not to strengthen, but to weaken the socialist camp and the international communist movement. They are the biggest splitters and enemies of unity. In fact, they act in concert with US imperialism, trying to bury the cause of revolution, to ensure that revolutions never happen in places where they have not yet occurred, to extinguish revolutions that have already occurred, and to reverse the revolutions that have already been victorious back to capitalism.
    There is nothing in common between Marxism-Leninism and modern revisionism. They are completely separated on any issue, and nothing unites them today. In this situation, our two parties and other Marxist-Leninist parties, as well as all genuine Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries around the world, have every reason to believe that our primary historical task is never to separate the struggle against imperialism from the struggle against modern revisionism at any moment.
    Dear Chinese comrades and brothers, our party, government, and people are the comrades-in-arms of your heroic party and glorious people, standing alongside you on the barricades of defending Marxism-Leninism, defending the socialist camp, defending the cause of the people of all countries, and defending world peace, and we feel deeply inspired and greatly honored. We will follow our path to the end, we are aware of the difficulties and sacrifices, and we believe that this is the only correct path to the victory of socialism, communism, and world peace.
    Our people, who have suffered greatly in the past and have learned many lessons from their own history and the history of other peoples, have never been afraid of obstacles, difficulties, sacrifices, and enemies. In the face of the enemy, we have never retreated in the past or present, but have faced them head-on with our chests out. Our people have fought against two occupying powers and achieved victory under the leadership of the party headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha. They have established their own regime, and in the past twenty-two years, they have transformed the People's Republic of Albania from a backward agricultural country into an agricultural-industrial country with a constantly developing socialist economy, an increasingly prosperous socialist culture, and a defense force that guarantees the people's victory over any enemy.
    Our people, under the difficult conditions of being surrounded by capitalism and revisionism, after successfully fulfilling the Third Five-Year Plan, have now begun to fight for the victorious fulfillment of the tasks of the first year of the Fourth Five-Year Plan – 1966, which will surely bring new and greater victories to our people.
    On this occasion, I would like to emphasize that the comprehensive, fraternal, and internationalist assistance given to our country by People's China is an important factor for the Albanian people in overcoming the obstacles and difficulties created for us by the imperialists and modern revisionists, and in achieving one success after another. Dear comrades, please allow me, on behalf of our party, government, and people, to express our heartfelt gratitude to your party, government, and people for this valuable assistance, and assure you that we will always stand shoulder to shoulder with you, our friendship is sincere, fraternal, unbreakable, and eternal, just like the Marxist-Leninist ideas, which are the foundation of our great friendship, unbreakable, and eternal.
    Dear comrades and esteemed friends, please raise your glasses:
    For the unbreakable and militant friendship between the Albanian people and the great Chinese people,
    For the heroic Chinese people,
    For the glorious Chinese Communist Party and its great leader, the esteemed friend of the Albanian people, dear Comrade Mao Zedong,
    For the fraternal People's Republic of China and its Chairman Comrade Liu Shaoqi,
    For the Vice-Chairman of the People's Republic of China Comrade Soong Ching Ling,

    在刘少奇、周恩来同志欢迎阿党政代表团的宴会上
    谢胡同志的讲话亲爱的刘少奇同志，亲爱的周恩来同志，敬爱的朋友们，先生们和女士们：
    刘少奇主席在这个隆重的招待会上，对阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、恩维尔·霍查同志和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府讲了十分热情和友好的话，我们深为感动，无限高兴。这些话真实地表达了两国人民、两国党和两国政府的牢不可破的、兄弟般的、国际主义的纯洁而炽热的友好感情。
    亲爱的同志们和朋友们，请允许我代表阿尔巴尼亚人民、阿尔巴尼亚劳动党、阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府，以及我国人民和我们党的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志本人，向伟大的七亿中国人民、你们的光荣英雄的党、你们政府以及阿尔巴尼亚人民的最伟大的、最亲爱的朋友毛泽东同志，转达牢不可破的、永恒的、兄弟般的发自内心的友情、最热烈的敬意和最良好的祝愿。同时，我以代表团的名义，对这个如此亲切和充满友情的招待会，表示衷心的感谢。
    阿中友好不是抽象的公式。它是始终执行处理社会主义国家和马克思列宁主义政党之间关系的马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义原则的结果和最崇高的表现。它是我们两国人民在马克思列宁主义党的领导下，为反对帝国主义占领者、反对封建主、资本家和反动派，争取民族和社会的解放，为了我们两国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业而进行共同的革命斗争的结果。它是我们反对以美国为首的帝国主义、各国反动派和以苏联现领导为中心的现代修正主义的共同斗争的最崇高的表现。我们过去和现在，同甘共苦，是不可分离的战友。我们一向高举纯洁的、光荣的马克思列宁主义旗帜，并肩携手，为了在我们两国和世界各个地方争取社会主义、共产主义和真正的和平的最后胜利，一刻不停地勇往直前。我们的友谊是进一步加强社会主义阵营、国际工人运动和共产主义运动以及各国人民反对帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的斗争的重要因素。我们两党，作为社会主义和共产主义战线上的两支久经考验的突击队，感到自己的国际主义的义务是：不断锤炼和增强这一钢铁般的友谊，使它日益坚强有力，更加牢不可破。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民和他们的党认为，中华人民共和国的诞生是伟大的中国革命在光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，所取得的历史性的胜利。这是社会主义阵营和整个人类的巨大幸运，因为这一具有世界意义的伟大事件彻底地改变了国际舞台上的力量对比，使其有利于革命、社会主义和共产主义。
    中华人民共和国在不长的时期内，已经变成一个拥有现代经济、现代科学技术和坚不可摧的现代国防的伟大的、强有力的社会主义国家。人民中国在世界舞台上的分量已经达到这样的地步，以至没有她的参加，不论任何性质的任何重大国际问题都不能获得解决。中华人民共和国在一切领域内所取得的每一个成就和胜利，都使世界各国人民由衷地感到欢欣鼓舞，而使人民中国的敌人和各国人民的敌人——美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义感到恼怒，因为伟大的人民中国以其正确的、具有原则性的马克思列宁主义政策，今天已经成了美帝国主义及其仆从为了主宰世界和实现其侵略和掠夺计划的主要的、不可逾越的障碍。
    美帝国主义至今还用武力霸占着中国领土不可分离的部分——台湾及其邻近的岛屿，竭力阻碍恢复中华人民共和国在联合国不可否认的合法权利，不断对中华人民共和国进行挑衅，在中国周围组织侵略性条约和建立军事基地并在各地点燃战火，以达到它主要和最终目的——对中华人民共和国进行直接的侵略。
    美帝国主义搜罗了一些国家的雇佣兵和它国内一部分最精锐的军队和军事装备，正在丧心病狂地在中国的大门前，在越南对英雄的兄弟的越南人民进行着战争。越南人民夺取了武器，正在进行一场把美国侵略者赶出越南南方、保卫北方、统一不可分割的祖国的史诗般的战争。约翰逊的“和平”解决越南问题的活动是一场虚伪的、恶毒的骗局。这是侵略者为了摆脱自己造成的完全孤立，为了挽救面临着的不可避免的失败，所进行的徒劳的挣扎。越南人民的英勇斗争是人民战争的大学校，它揭穿了帝国主义不可战胜的鬼话。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其党和政府毫无保留地支持兄弟的越南人民的斗争，并且坚信越南人民必将取得最后胜利。
    美帝国主义占领着南朝鲜，把它变成了综合性的军事基地，变成了压迫和饥饿的地方。美帝国主义对柬埔寨和老挝进行挑衅，煽动并支持日本军国主义，在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲许多国家组织反人民和反革命的阴谋和战争，在欧洲的中心大力复活德国复仇军国主义，从而严重地威胁着各国人民的自由、独立、主权、生命和世界和平。
    在世界的任何地方，美国佬的血手伸到哪里，哪里就有阴谋、军事政变、流血，哪里的人民就受压迫、受剥削、受杀害。各国人民每天都看到这些，时刻感受到这些，他们从内心里激发出对这些罪行的愤慨。正因为如此，世界各国人民奋起反抗他们的最危险的敌人美帝国主义及其形形色色的仆从。全世界人民主要的任务是：捆起美帝国主义的手脚，尽早地给以应得的下场。中华人民共和国站在这一斗争的前列，这是人类的未来的幸运。今天，中华人民共和国是坚不可摧的社会主义堡垒，是为争取自由、独立和经济社会进步而斗争的各国人民的希望、保证和强有力的依靠。
    中国共产党站在保卫马克思列宁主义、反对资产阶级意识形态的产物、国际共产主义和工人运动的主要危险现代修正主义斗争的前列。现代修正主义者现在实际上已经变成国际资产阶级和帝国主义的走狗和天然的同盟者。
    现代修正主义者，作为资产阶级的仆从和天然的同盟者，煞费心机地欺骗各国人民，蒙蔽他们的眼睛，使他们“相信”刽子手是有“人性的”，强盗是“善良的”，压迫者是“解放者”，国际宪兵美帝国主义是“明智的”，而美帝国主义也是“要和平的”，同它是“可以协商的”。现代修正主义者是帝国主义的“消防队员”，他们竭力要熄灭各国人民的革命火焰。现代修正主义者是帝国主义在社会主义、马克思列宁主义阵线背后和社会主义阵营及国际共产主义运动内部的出力讨好的破坏分子。在充当人类历史上空前的大背叛的这一不光彩的角色时，他们把主要的打击矛头集中指向社会主义的主要堡垒和马克思列宁主义的旗手中华人民共和国和中国共产党。
    他们进行着露骨的蛊惑，叫嚷社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动内部“团结一致”。但是，现代修正主义的目的不是团结一致，而是分裂；不是加强，而是削弱社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动。他们是团结的最大的分裂者和敌人。事实上，他们同美帝国主义联合行动，力图埋葬革命的事业，使还没有发生革命的地方永远不再发生革命，使已经发生的革命熄灭，使革命已经胜利的地方倒退到资本主义去。
    马克思列宁主义同现代修正主义之间没有任何共同的东西。他们之间在任何问题上都是截然分开的，没有任何东西使他们今天联合起来。在这种情况下，我们两党和其他马克思列宁主义的党，以及全世界所有真正的马克思列宁主义者和革命者，完全有理由认为：我们头等的历史任务，就是在任何时刻都不把反对帝国主义的斗争同反对现代修正主义的斗争分割开。
    亲爱的中国同志和兄弟们，我们党、政府和人民是你们英雄的党和光荣的人民的战友，同你们并肩一起，站在保卫马克思列宁主义、保卫社会主义阵营、保卫各国人民的事业和世界和平的街垒中，感到深受鼓舞和莫大光荣。我们将沿着我们的路走到底，我们意识到要有困难和牺牲，而且相信这是通向社会主义、共产主义胜利和世界和平的唯一正确的道路。
    过去曾经饱受苦难，并且从自己的历史和其它人民的历史中获得了许多教益的我国人民，过去和现在从来就不怕障碍，不怕困难，不怕牺牲和敌人。在敌人面前，我们过去和现在从来是不后退的，而是挺起胸膛迎上去。我国人民曾经同两国占领者进行过较量，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的党的领导下取得了胜利。他们建立了自己的政权，并在二十二年期间，把阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国从一个落后的农业国变成拥有不断发展的社会主义经济、日益繁荣的社会主义文化和保证人民战胜任何敌人的国防力量的农业工业国。
    我国人民处在资本主义和修正主义包围的困难条件下，在胜利地实现了第三个五年计划以后，现在已经开始为胜利实现第四个五年计划的第一年——一九六六年的计划任务而斗争，这一计划定将给我国人民带来新的、更大的胜利。
    借此机会，我愿意着重指出，人民中国给予我国的全面的、兄弟般的、国际主义的援助，是阿尔巴尼亚人民克服帝国主义者和现代修正主义者给我们制造的障碍和困难，并取得一个接一个成就的重要因素。亲爱的同志们，请允许我代表我们党、政府和人民，对这种宝贵的援助，向你们的党、政府和人民表示由衷的感谢，并且向你们保证，我们将永远同你们并肩携手地站在一起，我们的友谊是真诚的、兄弟般的、牢不可破的、永恒的，就象我们伟大友谊的基础马克思列宁主义的思想一样，是牢不可破的、永恒的。
    亲爱的同志们和尊敬的朋友们，请你们举杯：
    为阿尔巴尼亚人民和伟大的中国人民的牢不可破的战斗友谊，
    为英雄的中国人民，
    为光荣的中国共产党及其伟大的领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的尊贵的朋友亲爱的毛泽东同志，
    为兄弟的中华人民共和国及其主席刘少奇同志，
    为中华人民共和国副主席宋庆龄同志，
    为中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会及其委员长朱德同志，
    为中华人民共和国政府及其总理周恩来同志，
    为中共中央总书记邓小平同志，
    为出席招待会的外交团人员的健康，
    为在座的诸位的健康，
    为马克思列宁主义的胜利和光荣，
    为真正的和平和各国人民的友谊，
    干杯！
