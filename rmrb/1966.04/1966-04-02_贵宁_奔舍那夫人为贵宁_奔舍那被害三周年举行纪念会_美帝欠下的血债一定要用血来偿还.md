    Xinhua News Agency, 1st - Madame Quinim Pholsena of Laos held a memorial meeting in Beijing this morning for the third anniversary of the tragic murder of Quinim Pholsena, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Lao Provisional Government of National Union, by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    In the center of the meeting hall hung a portrait of Quinim Pholsena, before which were placed flower baskets presented by Premier Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife Zhang Qian, as well as other relevant parties. In her speech, Madame Quinim Pholsena denounced the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in murdering Quinim Pholsena, and condemned U.S. imperialism for its frantic invasion of Laos in coordination with its war of aggression in South Vietnam.

    Madame Quinim Pholsena said that the patriotic forces of Laos, under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front and Prince Souphanouvong, have achieved widespread development. In the past three years, the Lao patriotic armed forces and the entire Lao people have united as one and given U.S. imperialism the punishment it deserves.

    Madame Quinim Pholsena expressed her firm support for the position on resolving the Lao issue as elucidated in the declaration adopted by the Lao Political Consultative Conference. She expressed her determination to inherit the legacy of Quinim Pholsena and other patriotic martyrs and persist in the struggle. She said that the blood debt owed by U.S. imperialism to the people of the world must be repaid in blood.

    Madame Quinim Pholsena congratulated the Vietnamese people and the peoples of Indochina on the brilliant victories achieved in their anti-U.S. struggle, and thanked the Chinese government and the Chinese people for their continued support for the just struggle of the Lao people.

    Ju Zan, Vice President of the China-Laos Friendship Association, expressed his warm condolences to Madame Quinim Pholsena and her children in his speech. Ju Zan condemned U.S. imperialism for carrying out new military adventures in Laos. He said that the Chinese people have always firmly supported the just struggle of the Lao people against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He expressed his firm belief that, relying on the unity of all patriotic forces in Laos, the Lao people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation will surely achieve final victory.

    Si Vilay, a representative of Lao students in Beijing, also spoke at the memorial meeting, expressing his determination to learn from Quinim Pholsena's patriotic and anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit and carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism to the end.

    Also present at the memorial meeting were Lian Guan, President of the China-Laos Friendship Association, and his wife, Ding Xilin, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and his wife, as well as relevant responsible persons Sun Xiaocun, Zhou Shujia, Wang Chuanbin, Dong Xuelin, and others.
