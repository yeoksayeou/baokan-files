    “Remember the Party”
    Wang Qingheng, Li Qi, Liu Yibu
    On March 14th, as the sun was just rising in the east, Yin Yanfen, the wife of poor peasant Sun Yusheng, gave birth to a girl in the Su Zhuang Brigade of the Mao’erzhai Commune in Longyao County. According to custom, girls' names are usually something like "Flower" or "Plum," but Yin Yanfen's girl was neither named Flower nor Plum, but "Nian Dang" (Remember the Party).
    Five days before, a strong earthquake had struck here. The family's house was currently being repaired, the stove was being rebuilt, and life had not yet been settled. On the morning of the 13th, Yin Yanfen felt a pang of abdominal pain, sensing that labor was imminent. At this time, let alone giving birth, even a small disaster or illness would be troublesome. What if something serious happened!
    Just then, a group of medical personnel from the Air Force General Hospital, carrying stretchers, hurried to their home. Sun Yusheng was stunned when he saw these People's Liberation Army soldiers:
    “You are…”
    “We are the medical team sent by Chairman Mao, here to pick up Comrade Yin.”
    Three days earlier, Li Huiyun, an obstetrician from this medical team, upon entering the village, hadn't even set up her tent or wiped away her sweat before plunging into the homes of commune members to rescue the injured and conduct door-to-door investigations. During the visits, she learned the expected delivery dates of seven or eight pregnant women in the village and promised to come and help when the time came. Yin Yanfen was one of them.
    Now, seeing so many people helping, the worry on Sun Yusheng's face disappeared, but he was still a little anxious, as he hadn't prepared anything for the birth! The medical personnel saw his concerns and said, "Don't worry!"
    Yin Yanfen was carried to the tent called the "battlefield hospital." Some people were doing prenatal check-ups, some were preparing instruments and medicines, some were busy boiling water, some used medicine bottles and rubber to make a baby bottle, and some took out the brown sugar that three female soldiers from this hospital's pediatrics department had brought to the disaster-stricken masses, along with the powdered milk donated by the state. Cao Junjie, the head nurse, took her own shirt out of her bag, and nurse Huang Yihua took her blue army pants out of her tote bag. They then found cotton, scissors, and a skillful young woman to cut and sew, and several people busily sewed a small cotton jacket.
    Night fell, and the cold was just beginning to creep in. The nurses had already found braziers and firewood, lit them, and placed them next to the expectant mother. The flames danced joyfully, warming the hearts of the class sisters! Flashlights lit up, and the nurses busied themselves. Everyone eagerly awaited the moment of concern's arrival.
    The baby was born safely. Huang Yihua picked up the child, wrapped it in her own coat, held it in her arms, and gazed at it again and again. At this moment, a nurse suddenly asked Li Huiyun, "Is it a boy or a girl?" "Boy!" As soon as the words were spoken, everyone burst into laughter. Li Huiyun, due to excessive excitement, had mistakenly reported the child's gender.
    The red sun gradually rose higher. Sun Yusheng walked in quietly. He looked around: his wife was lying peacefully on the bed, with thick mattresses underneath and a thick quilt on top, with a yellow coat pressed against the foot of the bed. The fire in the brazier beside the bed had died down, but the embers were still glowing. Hot congee and fragrant brown sugar were placed by the bedside. This didn’t seem like a disaster area at all!
    Sun Yusheng looked closely at his daughter lying in her mother's arms. He turned around and said to the nurses standing beside him, "Comrade People's Liberation Army, how can I thank you!" The nurses said, "This is what we should do. If you want to thank someone, thank Chairman Mao!" Yusheng said, "Comrades, please give my daughter a name!"
    The mention of a name aroused everyone's interest. "Give her a name with what meaning?" Sun Yusheng looked at the child, and the history of his family flooded into his mind: his sixty-nine-year-old father had fled famine twelve times before liberation, his eldest sister had been given away as a child bride at the age of six, his eldest brother had died of starvation on the road while fleeing famine at the age of three, his second brother had just been born when he stopped breathing, and his mother had worked as a servant for others, toiling hard her whole life, and finally died of illness and hunger outside. At that time, he was less than two years old, and his father wrapped him in a tattered cotton-padded coat and begged for food to return… Now, if it weren't for the Party and Chairman Mao, in such a great disaster, not only the child, but even the child's mother would have died.
    "Comrades, give her a name to thank the Party and Chairman Mao!" Everyone discussed for a while. One nurse said, "How about 'Dangsheng' (Party Born)?" Yusheng thought for a moment and said, "It's good, but it's connected to me, and we both have the word 'sheng' (born)." There was a moment of silence. Suddenly, someone exclaimed, "Nian Dang! 'Nian' (remember) as in remembering, 'Dang' (Party) as in the Communist Party." Yusheng and Yanfen almost simultaneously said happily, "Good! Good! This name is really good! We'll call her that so she will always remember the Party and Chairman Mao!"
    Yusheng stepped forward, picked up his daughter, and called out several times, "Nian Dang! Nian Dang!"

    “念党”
    王庆恒　李琦　刘一步
    三月十四日，太阳刚从东方升起，在隆尧县毛尔寨公社苏庄大队，贫农孙玉生的妻子尹燕芬生了个女孩儿。按照习惯，女孩儿的名儿总是什么花呀，梅呀的，但尹燕芬的女孩，既不带花，也不带梅，而是叫“念党”。
    五天之前，这里发生了强烈的地震，眼下家里房子正在修，锅灶正在盘，生活还没有安排妥当。十三日上午，尹燕芬一阵腹痛，预感就要临产了。在这个时候，别说生小孩，就是有个小灾小病也够麻烦的了，万一有个三长两短可怎么办呢！
    就在这个时候，空军总医院一批医务人员，抬着担架匆匆地来到他们家里，孙玉生看着这些解放军一下楞住了：
    “你们是……”
    “我们是毛主席派来的医疗队，是来接尹同志的。”
    三天前，这个医疗队的助产士李惠韵进村时，帐篷没搭，汗水没擦，就一头扎到社员家里，抢救受伤人员，还挨门挨户调查访问。在访问中，他了解了村里七、八个孕妇的临产日期，并约好到时候一定来帮助。尹燕芬就是其中的一个。
    现在孙玉生看到这么多人帮忙，脸上的愁容消失了，但还有些着急，生产所需要的东西都没有准备呀！医务人员看出了他的心思，说：“请放心吧！”
    尹燕芬被抬到被称为“战地医院”的帐篷里。有人作产前检查，有人准备器械药品，有人忙去烧水，有人用药瓶和橡皮作了个奶瓶，有人把这个医院小儿科三个女战士捎给灾区群众的红糖，和国家慰问的奶粉一起拿了出来。护士长曹俊杰从挂包里抽出自己的衬衣，护士黄一华从提兜里拿出自己的蓝军裤，又去找来棉花，拿出剪子，找来一位心灵手巧的姑娘来剪裁，几个人七手八脚地缝起了小棉袄。
    夜来临了，寒气刚刚向人们袭来。护士们已经找来了火盆、木柴，生着了火，端到了产妇的身旁。火苗欢乐跳跃，温暖着阶级姐妹的心！手电亮起来了，护士们忙起来了，人们都在急切地期待着那关心的时刻的到来。
    婴儿平安地降生了。黄一华把孩子抱过来，包上自己的大衣，抱在怀里，瞅了又瞅。这时，一个护士忽然问李惠韵：“是男孩，还是女孩？”“男孩！”话音刚落，惹的大家哄堂大笑。李惠韵由于过度的兴奋，竟然报错了孩子的性别。
    红日渐渐地升高，孙玉生轻轻走进来，他四下里打量着：妻子已经安详地躺在铺上，底下垫着厚墩墩的褥子，上面盖着厚厚的被子，脚头还压着黄色的大衣。床边的火盆里火苗下去了，火炭还是旺旺的。床头放着热腾腾的稀饭，香喷喷的红糖。这一切，那里象是在灾区啊！
    孙玉生端详着躺在母亲怀抱里的女儿。转回身来向站在旁边的护士们说：“解放军同志，要我怎样感谢你们哩！”护士同志说：“这是我们应尽力的事，要感谢就感谢毛主席！”玉生说：“同志，请你们给俺闺女起个名儿吧！”
    一说起名，引起了大家的兴趣。“起个带什么意思的？”孙玉生瞅着孩子，家史一幕幕涌上心头：六十九岁的父亲，在解放前就逃过十二次荒，大姐姐六岁上给人家当了童养媳，大哥哥三岁死在了逃荒的路上，二哥哥刚刚生下来就断了气，母亲给人家当佣人，勤苦操劳一辈子，最后连病带饿，死在了外面。那时自己不满两岁，父亲用开了花的破棉袄裹着，讨着饭回来的……。现在，要不是党和毛主席，这样的大灾，别说孩子，连孩子的娘也没命了。
    “同志，就给起个感谢党和毛主席的名儿吧！”大家议论了一阵，一位护士说：“叫‘党生’怎么样？”玉生思索一会说：“好是好，就是和我连着，都有个‘生’字。”一阵静默，忽然有人高声说：“念党！纪念的‘念’，共产党的‘党’。”玉生、燕芬几乎同时高兴地说：“好！好！这名字真好！我们叫她永远记住党和毛主席！”
    玉生抢上一步，抱起女儿连叫了几声：“念党！念党！”
