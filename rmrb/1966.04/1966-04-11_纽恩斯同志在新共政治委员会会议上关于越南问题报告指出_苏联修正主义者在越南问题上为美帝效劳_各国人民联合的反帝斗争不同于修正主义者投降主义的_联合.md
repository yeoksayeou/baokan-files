    Xinhua News Agency, Auckland, 10th—The March issue of the New Zealand Communist Party organ "New Zealand Communist Review" published an abstract of a report given by Ray Nunes, Secretary of the National Secretariat of the New Zealand Communist Party, at a meeting of the Political Committee of the New Zealand Communist Party on February 2. The report, entitled "The Party's Role and Tasks on the Vietnam Issue," pointed out that Soviet revisionists are serving the United States and dare not genuinely oppose US imperialism. The so-called "unity" advocated by modern revisionists on the Vietnam issue is false and a capitulationist unity. The Chinese Party and state leaders resolutely support the Vietnamese people and oppose US imperialism from a firm stand based on Marxist-Leninist principles.
    Referring to the situation in South Vietnam, the report said that contrary to all the propaganda of US imperialism and its vassal states, the People's Armed Forces of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front are winning in South Vietnam. The US government has had to invest more and more troops and new weapons. Despite large-scale military intervention to date, the imperialists have not been able to stop the People's Armed Forces from liberating more than 80% of the territory and over ten million people. In South Vietnam, the real government and regime today is the government and regime of the National Liberation Front.
    The report said that the aggressive US imperialism is making all kinds of threats and boasts. The failures it has suffered and the increasing isolation of the United States among the people of all countries are creating a crisis of policy within the US ruling group. This crisis is caused by the complete failure of all US plans. First, their so-called "pacification" plan to force the people of the South to abandon their struggle by increasing violence and terror against the people of the South and bombing the North has failed. Second, their plan to intimidate China with the threat of nuclear war and other wars, thereby forcing it to abandon its firm support for the people of South and North Vietnam and abandon its role as a powerful fortress against US imperialism, has also failed.
    The report pointed out that China firmly supports the struggle of the Vietnamese people. The Chinese Party and state leaders are proceeding from a firm stand based on Marxist-Leninist principles, not from the treacherous, revisionist quagmire on which the Soviet Party and state leaders stand.
    Soviet modern revisionists are serving the United States. They dare not genuinely oppose US imperialism. Soviet revisionists are trying their best to avoid offending Washington. Therefore, their "aid" to Vietnam is as little as possible, with the aim of avoiding direct US-Soviet confrontation at all costs, but they hope that the amount of this "aid" will be sufficient to avoid completely exposing their faces as accomplices of the United States and to enable them to obtain a position in Vietnam from which they can command surrender. However, imperialism still takes imperialist actions, which makes their situation increasingly difficult.
    The report pointed out that under the guise of its hypocritical peace talks, US imperialism is taking new aggressive actions throughout the Indochina peninsula, including Laos and Cambodia. US imperialism's constant expansion of aggression and escalation reflects its desire to plunder the world. This desire powerfully demonstrates the ambitions of US imperialists to dominate the world, driving them to engage in dangerous adventures similar to those of Hitler. But inevitably, the new escalation will increase US pressure on its allies and dependencies—including New Zealand and Australia—to contribute more people and more money, further exacerbating the contradictions between US imperialism and the people of all countries—including the American people. The intensification of this contradiction will certainly also help to further expose the revisionist tools of US imperialism.
    The report said that all these current developments are conducive to the development of the united, genuine anti-imperialist struggle of the people of all countries, a united struggle that differs from the false, capitulationist "unity" demanded by the revisionists.
    Currently, the broad movement within New Zealand against the use of New Zealand troops and to stop US intervention in Vietnam is the main political content of the New Zealand people's struggle against US imperialism. The main feature of this movement is that the party plays a leading role rather than developing spontaneously. The reason why this movement has rapidly acquired organized, mass characteristics is mainly due to the active organizational leadership of the party. The party did not wait for spontaneous activity to develop; it acted quickly. The party first established a leading core among industrial workers, which has the necessary understanding, power, and initiative to influence the working class and, through the working class, to extend its influence to other strata, such as the various strata of the middle class and intellectuals, etc., and, to a certain extent, to directly influence these other strata. The working class must constitute the basis of any broad movement if that movement is to become truly broad and powerful.
    The report said that we must make unremitting efforts to develop mass protest activities based on demanding not only the withdrawal of New Zealand troops but also the withdrawal of US troops. The withdrawal of New Zealand troops would be a heavy blow to US imperialism. The possibility of such a withdrawal exists. However, if New Zealand troops are indeed withdrawn, the United States can still remain in Vietnam and continue to escalate the war, and New Zealand troops may be dragged back in again. Therefore, the withdrawal of New Zealand alone is not enough. To truly ensure that New Zealand troops are withdrawn permanently, US troops must withdraw so that peace can be established in Vietnam. The report said that forcing the withdrawal of US troops from Vietnam is the absolute obligation of the international working class. The New Zealand Communist Party must do everything possible to carry out the broadest activities to achieve this, regardless of whether New Zealand troops are involved.

### 纽恩斯同志在新共政治委员会会议上关于越南问题报告指出  苏联修正主义者在越南问题上为美帝效劳  各国人民联合的反帝斗争不同于修正主义者投降主义的“联合”

    纽恩斯同志在新共政治委员会会议上关于越南问题报告指出
    苏联修正主义者在越南问题上为美帝效劳
    各国人民联合的反帝斗争不同于修正主义者投降主义的“联合”
    新华社十日讯　奥克兰消息：新西兰共产党机关刊物《新西兰共产主义评论》三月号刊登了新西兰共产党全国书记处书记雷·纽恩斯二月二日在新西兰共产党政治委员会会议上报告的摘要。这个题为《党在越南问题上的作用和任务》的报告指出，苏联修正主义者在为美国效劳，不敢真正反对美帝国主义。现代修正主义者在越南问题上鼓吹的所谓“联合”是假的，是投降主义的联合。中国党和国家领导人从马克思列宁主义原则的坚定立场出发，坚决支持越南人民，反对美帝国主义。
    报告在谈到南越的形势时说，同美帝国主义及其附庸国的一切宣传相反，南越民族解放阵线的人民军队正在南越获胜。美国政府不得不投入愈来愈多的军队和新式武器，尽管到目前为止进行了大规模军事干涉，帝国主义者并没有能够制止人民军队解放百分之八十以上的地区和一千万以上的人民。在越南南方，今天真正的政府和政权是民族解放阵线的政府和政权。
    报告说，侵略成性的美帝国主义进行种种威胁和吹嘘，它遭到的失败以及美国在各国人民当中越来越孤立这一状况，正在造成美国统治集团的政策危机。这个危机是美国的一切计划完全失败所引起的。首先，他们对南方人民采取与日俱增的暴力和恐怖行动，轰炸北方，企图迫使南方人民放弃斗争的所谓“绥靖”计划失败了。其次，他们以核战争和其他战争的威胁吓唬中国、从而迫使它放弃对越南南方和北方人民的坚决支持、放弃它所起的反对美帝国主义的斗争的强大堡垒的作用的计划也失败了。
    报告指出，中国坚决支持越南人民的斗争。中国党和国家领导人是从马克思列宁主义原则的坚定立场出发的，而不是从苏联党和国家领导所立足的背叛的、修正主义泥坑的立场出发的。
    苏联现代修正主义者在为美国效劳。他们不敢真正反对美帝国主义。苏联修正主义者竭力避免得罪华盛顿。因此，他们对越南的“援助”是尽可能的少，目的是不惜一切代价避免美苏直接对抗，但是他们希望这种“援助”的数目又要足以避免完全暴露出他们作为美国的帮凶的嘴脸，并使他们在越南得到他们能够号令投降的地位。然而，帝国主义还是照样采取帝国主义的行动，这就使他们的处境越来越为难。
    报告指出，美帝国主义在其伪善的和谈的幌子下，正在包括老挝和柬埔寨在内的整个印度支那半岛采取新的侵略行动。美帝国主义不断地扩大侵略和升级，反映其掠夺世界的欲望，这种欲望有力地表明美帝国主义者称霸世界的野心，驱使他们从事类似希特勒的危险的冒险事业。但是不可避免的是，新的升级将使美国增加对它的盟国和附属国——包括新西兰和澳大利亚在内——的压力，要它们出更多的人、更多的钱，使美帝国主义同各国人民——包括美国人民在内——的矛盾进一步加剧。这个矛盾的加剧一定也有利于进一步暴露美帝国主义的修正主义工具。
    报告说，当前这一切事态发展有利于各国人民联合的、真正反帝的斗争的发展，这种联合的斗争，与修正主义者所要求的假的、投降主义的“联合”不同。
    现在，新西兰国内反对使用新西兰军队和争取制止美国在越南的干涉的广泛运动，是新西兰人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的主要政治内容。这个运动的主要特点是党起了领导作用而不是自发地发展。这一运动所以迅速地具备有组织、群众性的特点，主要是由于党的积极的组织领导作用。党并未等待自发活动发展，它迅速地采取了行动。党首先在产业工人当中建立起领导核心，这个领导核心有必要的认识、权力和主动性，来影响工人阶级，并且通过工人阶级，把影响扩大到其他阶层，诸如中产阶级各阶层和知识分子等等当中，此外，在一定程度上直接影响这些其他阶层。工人阶级必须构成任何广泛的运动的基础，如果那个运动要成为真正广泛和强大的话。
    报告说，我们必须坚持不懈地努力，以发展群众性的抗议活动，这种活动是以不仅要求新西兰军队撤走，而且要求美国军队撤走为基础的。撤出新西兰部队对美帝国主义将是一个沉重打击。这种撤出的可能性是存在的。可是，如果真的撤出了新西兰的部队，美国仍然能留在越南，仍然能使战争继续升级，这样新西兰部队就可能重新被拖回去。因此，光是新西兰撤出是不够的。要真正使新西兰部队永远撤出，就必须使美军撤离，以便能够在越南建立和平。报告说，迫使美国军队撤离越南是国际工人阶级的绝对的义务。新西兰共产党必须竭尽全力开展最广泛的活动，以求实现这一点，不论新西兰部队是不是卷入。
