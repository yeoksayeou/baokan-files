    The Sorrow of the Cake Painter
    Leng Ran

    Not long ago, the American magazine *Life* declared triumphantly in an editorial that the United States was in a "pretty good state" in the war of aggression against Vietnam, and that the future was very promising. The magazine also listed a fairly specific timetable for the development of the war situation. It is said that America's "first stage victory" "should arrive by the end of this year or the beginning of next year," at which time the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces will become small groups with little combat effectiveness; and by the early 1970s, the United States will achieve a "second stage victory," at which time the activities of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces will be "reduced to the scale of a police problem."

    All of this is so wonderful for Washington! However, one cannot help but wonder, what can a few scribblers from an American magazine rely on to prescribe such a specific process for the development of the war situation?

    Some American journalists revealed that this "victory timetable" was not written by *Life* magazine, "it obviously came directly from the White House."

    Then another question arises: The future of the war of aggression against Vietnam has always caused great concern among the American ruling group, and Washington is currently panicked and in chaos. Since the White House has such an optimistic timetable, why is it only informally revealed through a magazine? Wouldn't it be more encouraging to morale if it were officially announced by government officials?

    Associated Press reporter Malcolm Browne revealed the reason in a report. He wrote: "...no official is willing to publicly admit that there is a timetable for achieving victory. Too many officials in the past have suffered from making overly optimistic predictions about the collapse of the Viet Cong."

    So that's it. This so-called "victory timetable" sounds logical and seems quite certain; in reality, even government officials know that it is meaningless. This is truly painting a cake to satisfy hunger, deceiving oneself and others.

    Su Dongpo has two lines of poetry: "Painting a cake on the ground is not necessarily similar, but it is necessary to make the foolish child drool." The future of the American war of aggression against Vietnam is becoming more and more bleak, and the American ruling group dreams of "achieving victory in the war" but cannot achieve it. The Johnson administration has drawn so many "victory timetable" cakes in the past, just to satisfy these foolish children. However, painting a cake cannot satisfy hunger after all; after drooling, the foolish children cannot help but be dissatisfied with the cake painter for being deceived. This makes the Johnson administration worry when painting the cake again this time, and it dares not do it itself, but has to entrust those boring writers of *Life* magazine to do it on its behalf.

    What exactly is the "state" of the United States in the war of aggression against Vietnam? The embarrassment of the Johnson administration when painting the cake is an excellent illustration.

    画饼者的悲哀
    冷然
    美国《生活》杂志不久前在一篇社论里得意洋洋地宣称：美国在侵越战争中“景况相当好”，前途是大可乐观的。这家杂志还为战局的发展列出了一个颇为具体的时间表。据说，美国的“第一期胜利”“应当在今年底或明年初到来”，那时南越人民武装将成为没有什么战斗力的小股队伍；而到七十年代初美国又将得到“第二期的胜利”，那时南越人民武装的活动更是“下降为一个警察问题的规模”了。
    这一切，对华盛顿说来是多么美妙啊！但是，人们不免奇怪，一家美国杂志的几个耍笔杆的人物，凭着什么能够给战局发展规定如此具体的进程呢？
    一些美国记者透露，这个“胜利时间表”并非《生活》杂志的手笔，“它显然是直接来自白宫”。
    于是，又出现了另一个问题：侵越战争的前途一直使得美国统治集团大感忧虑，华盛顿目前正人心惶惶、乱成一团；既然白宫有了这样一个令人乐观的时间表，为什么只是通过一家杂志来非正式地透露一下呢？如果由官方人士正式宣布，岂不更能鼓舞士气吗？
    美联社记者马尔科姆·布朗在一篇报道里道出了其中的原委。他写道：“……没有任何官员愿意公开承认存在一个取得胜利的时间表。过去有太多的官员由于对越共垮台作了过分乐观的预测而吃了亏。”
    原来如此。这个所谓“胜利时间表”听起来头头是道，似乎蛮有把握；实际上连官方人士也知道是毫无实际意义的。这真是画饼充饥，自欺欺人。
    苏东坡有两句诗说：“画地为饼未必似，要令痴儿出馋水。”美国侵越战争前途越来越不妙，美国统治集团对“取得战争胜利”梦寐以求而不可得。约翰逊政府过去曾画了多少次“胜利时间表”的饼，聊为这些痴儿解解馋。然而，画饼毕竟不能充饥；痴儿在流过馋水以后不能不为自己受了哄骗而对画饼者不满。这就使得约翰逊政府在这次再度画饼的时候顾虑重重，不敢自己动手，而只好委托《生活》杂志那些无聊文人代劳了。
    美国在侵越战争中“景况”究竟怎样？约翰逊政府画饼时的窘态就是一个极好的说明。
