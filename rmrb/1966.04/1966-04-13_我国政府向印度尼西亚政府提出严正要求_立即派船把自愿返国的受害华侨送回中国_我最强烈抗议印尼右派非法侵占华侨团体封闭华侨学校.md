    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Xu Jingwu, Deputy Director of the First Asian Department of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, summoned Indonesian Ambassador to China, Djawoto, on the morning of the 12th and handed him a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Indonesian Embassy in China. The note expressed extreme indignation at the large-scale anti-Chinese atrocities organized and planned by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. The note pointed out that the Indonesian government has the responsibility to send persecuted Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to China back to China, and demanded that the Indonesian government immediately arrange ships to send Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to China back to China. The full text of the note is as follows:
    To the Indonesian Embassy in China:
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its respects to the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China, and states the following:
    Since October 1965, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have organized and planned a large-scale anti-Chinese movement. They have organized large numbers of thugs in various provinces and cities across Indonesia to wantonly persecute innocent Overseas Chinese. The homes and shops of tens of thousands of Overseas Chinese have been looted and burned. Many Overseas Chinese organizations and schools have been destroyed and occupied. Large numbers of Overseas Chinese have been beaten and unreasonably arrested. Many Overseas Chinese have been brutally murdered, even beheaded, disemboweled, dismembered, and burned to death. The local army authorities in some areas not only sheltered these atrocities but even issued "demonstration" permits to the thugs and dispatched armed personnel and military vehicles to participate directly. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' racist persecution of Overseas Chinese has grossly violated the norms of international relations and reached a shocking level. The Chinese people feel extremely indignant about these atrocities.
    Overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations have always lived in harmony with the Indonesian people, made positive contributions to Indonesia's economic life, strived to promote friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and actively supported the Indonesian people's struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' frantic persecution of Overseas Chinese is obviously to cater to the needs of imperialism, deliberately sabotage relations between China and Indonesia, and undermine the unity of the two peoples in the anti-imperialist struggle. No matter what excuses the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces make, they cannot conceal their despicable conspiracy.
    According to the relevant treaties and agreements signed between the Chinese government and the Indonesian government on the issue of nationals of the two countries, the Indonesian government has an undeniable obligation to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals. However, the Indonesian government not only fails to fulfill the above-mentioned obligations but also allows or even shields the right-wing reactionary forces' frantic persecution of Overseas Chinese, completely disregarding the Chinese government's repeated protests and representations to the Indonesian government. Recently, the Indonesian government, through the military authorities in Jakarta and other places, even issued orders viciously slandering Overseas Chinese organizations and schools as "dens of subversives and counter-revolutionaries," and using this as an excuse to close and disband Overseas Chinese organizations and schools. This shows that the Indonesian government is further supporting the right-wing reactionary forces' crimes of persecuting Overseas Chinese, thereby inescapably assuming the responsibility for further worsening relations between the two countries.
    Currently, tens of thousands of persecuted Overseas Chinese, having been ruined and lost their livelihoods, urgently request the Indonesian government to be responsible for assisting them in returning to their motherland. Their demand is completely reasonable and entirely legitimate. Since the Indonesian government has neither effectively protected them from persecution nor provided them with relief and resettlement, the Indonesian government is of course responsible for sending the persecuted Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to China back to China. To this end, the Chinese government requests the Indonesian government to:
    1. Immediately arrange ships to send the aforementioned Overseas Chinese who voluntarily wish to return to China back to China.
    2. Allow them to bring their own property and funds back to China.
    3. Ensure their safety on the way to the port, be responsible for their food and accommodation at the port, and assist them in smoothly leaving Indonesia to return to China.
    4. The Chinese Embassy and Consulates in Indonesia will assign officials to assist the work of Overseas Chinese who voluntarily return to their motherland. It is hoped that the Indonesian government will be responsible for protecting the safety of Chinese officials and providing necessary convenience.
    Please give a prompt response to the above requests.
    With the highest respect.
                      Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
                        Beijing, April 12, 1966
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Jakarta News: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia delivered a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on the 11th, lodging the strongest protest against the serious incidents of the illegal occupation of Overseas Chinese organizations in Jakarta, Bandung, Malang, and other areas by thugs organized by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. The note demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop the atrocities of occupying Overseas Chinese organizations and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.
    The note said that at 7:30 a.m. on April 8, 1966, about 40 thugs who claimed to be from the "Indonesian University Students Action Union" (KAMI) and the "Indonesian Youth and Students Action Union" (KABI), armed with clubs, iron chains, daggers, and other weapons, broke into the Jakarta Chinese Overseas Chinese General Association in jeeps, forcibly occupied the association's premises, and conducted an illegal search. They blatantly tore up the Chinese national flag and portraits of national leaders and even raised the Indonesian flag in the courtyard. They also illegally detained about 120 Overseas Chinese staff members of the association, as well as Overseas Chinese who came to entrust the procedures for selecting nationality and passports and to see doctors, set up interrogation rooms privately, conducted barbaric interrogations one by one, forced answers to many questions slandering China, threatened with knives, forced body searches, and punched and kicked. Some Overseas Chinese were detained and abused for more than ten hours, and even women and the elderly were not spared. Various documents were searched, and more than 20 cars and motorcycles ridden by the Overseas Chinese General Association and visitors were detained and sealed. The thugs also painted anti-Chinese slogans such as "The ownership of the house belongs to KABI," "Hang the Chinese," and "Drive out the Chinese" on the gate and walls of the association. Huang Muhe, a staff member of the Overseas Chinese General Association, was illegally kidnapped for refusing to sign the deed of transfer of property drafted by the thugs.
    The note said that at the same time, thugs also forcibly occupied the premises of ten other Overseas Chinese organizations in Jakarta in batches, namely the Women's Association, the Hardware Businessmen's Association, the New Life Association, the Minsheng Society, the Yongding Guild Hall, the Zhangzhou Native Place Association, the Qiongqiao Native Place Association, the Tongyi Society, the Nan'an Guild Hall, and the Yongchun Guild Hall. As of April 10, the Chinese Overseas Chinese General Association and the other ten Overseas Chinese organizations were guarded by armed troops, and some association premises were still occupied by thugs.
    The note said that what is even more shocking is that the thugs actually openly kidnapped eight staff members of the respective Overseas Chinese organizations and Overseas Chinese, and took them to a secret interrogation room set up in the Overseas Chinese "Yecheng Middle School" guarded by the army to force confessions. After their various deceptive means completely failed, they severely tortured the arrested personnel. Some were stripped naked, tied to chairs, and beaten severely on the chest, abdomen, and lower body with wooden sticks and leather whips. Some were tortured for as long as six hours and fainted several times, but they always protested sternly and never yielded, even when the thugs threatened to use electric shock and bury them alive, they were not afraid. The soldiers stationed at the school repeatedly appeared in this interrogation room and talked and laughed freely with the thugs.
    The note said that in West Java, since mid-March, according to incomplete statistics, the premises or halls of ten Overseas Chinese organizations in Bandung, including the Overseas Chinese Public Association, the Yurong Public Association, the Guangzhao Guild Hall, the Women's Association, the Nanhua Association, the Youth Natural Science Association, the Fupu Public Association, the Tricycle Public Association, the Jinshang Public Association, and the Yongding Public Association, have been forcibly occupied by thugs. All the documents and files of the Bandung Chinese General Association have been looted, and it is impossible to carry out the association's work. In addition, thirteen Chinese General Associations and other Overseas Chinese organizations in the areas of Sukabumi, Cianjur, Bogor, Garut, Cirebon, and Sumedang belonging to West Java have also been illegally occupied by thugs.
    In Malang City, East Java, the Chinese General Association and six other Overseas Chinese organizations were illegally occupied by thugs on March 30 and 31.
    The note said that it should be solemnly pointed out that Overseas Chinese organizations in Indonesia are aimed at carrying out Overseas Chinese welfare undertakings and have always actively supported the Indonesian people's anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle, and are an important bridge for enhancing the friendship between the two peoples. Overseas Chinese organizations in various places earnestly guide the vast number of Overseas Chinese to live in harmony with the Indonesian people and enthusiastically support local social welfare construction undertakings. For a long time, they have also assisted local government departments in carrying out many beneficial affairs activities and have long been recognized by the Indonesian government as legal organizations and have received good praise from the public. The note said that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces openly disregarded the norms of international law and international practices, and in broad daylight, in the capital Jakarta and other cities, organized thugs to destroy and illegally occupy the above-mentioned Overseas Chinese organizations in various places so rampantly, so rudely infringing upon the human rights of Overseas Chinese, kidnapping and illegally interrogating innocent Overseas Chinese organization personnel. And the fully armed army actually protects and assists the illegal crimes of these thugs, which cannot but cause great indignation! The note said that the embassy lodges the strongest protest with the Indonesian government against the above-mentioned serious incidents. The embassy requests the Indonesian government to immediately take effective measures to return the illegally occupied Overseas Chinese organization premises, stop the spread of atrocities of occupying Overseas Chinese organizations, investigate the perpetrators and instigators of the incident, return the documents and archives and all the property looted by the thugs, release the illegally detained Overseas Chinese organization staff members, effectively protect the safety of Overseas Chinese organizations and their staff members, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.
    Xinhua News Agency, 12th. Jakarta News: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia delivered a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia on the 11th, lodging a strong protest against the serious incidents of the heads of the Jakarta Military Region, the West Java Military Region, and the South Sumatra Military Region flagrantly ordering the closure of Overseas Chinese schools in their respective jurisdictions.
    The note said that on April 5, 1966, the head of the Fifth Military Region, in the name of the holders of two people's orders in the Jakarta Special Region, issued Decision No. (DU), flagrantly closing all Overseas Chinese schools in the Jakarta area, forcibly disbanding the organizations that run these schools, and declaring these Overseas Chinese schools and sponsoring organizations to be prohibited units. What is particularly infuriating is that the head of the Jakarta Military Region, in his decision, disregarded the facts, fabricated out of thin air, and deliberately slandered the Overseas Chinese schools and their sponsoring organizations. He said that these Overseas Chinese schools and their sponsoring organizations, in the prelude and aftermath of the "November 11th Incident," "became dens of subversives and counter-revolutionaries," and therefore "there appeared actions of the masses of the people reflecting social anger, all of which were directed at the above-mentioned schools." To put it bluntly, the Jakarta military authorities, in order to cover up their unreasonable measures, specially created this fabricated charge and imposed it on Overseas Chinese schools and their sponsoring organizations.
    On April 6, the day after the decision was issued, the Jakarta military authorities dispatched armed troops armed with live ammunition, together with thugs from right-wing organizations, to forcibly seal off all 51 Overseas Chinese schools in the Jakarta area, including 4 high schools, 13 junior high schools, 25 primary schools, and 9 kindergartens. This caused more than 40,000 Overseas Chinese students and more than 1,400 teachers to lose their schooling and jobs.
    The note said that on April 7, 1966, the head of the Sixth Military Region, in the name of the holders of two people's orders in West Java, also issued a decision, flagrantly closing all Overseas Chinese schools in his jurisdiction. Prior to this, since March 12, Overseas Chinese schools in the West Java area have been attacked, destroyed, and illegally occupied by thugs organized by right-wing reactionary forces. The embassy has made serious representations to the Indonesian government on this matter, but to no avail. Obviously, the illegal occupation by thugs and the flagrant closure by the military authorities are premeditated and planned coordinated actions, which is a fact that the right-wing reactionary forces themselves do not deny.
    The note said that the embassy has also learned that as early as March 30, the head of the Fourth Military Region, in the name of the holders of two people's orders in South Sumatra, ordered the closure of all Overseas Chinese schools in his jurisdiction. The note said that it is well known that Overseas Chinese schools in Indonesia are places where Overseas Chinese children seek knowledge. For a long time, they have held legal licenses from the Indonesian government and accepted the supervision and assistance of the Indonesian cultural and educational authorities. Not only are they legitimate Overseas Chinese rights and interests recognized by international law and international practice, but they are also Overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings that the Indonesian government should protect. After the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, Overseas Chinese schools have made active contributions to bridging the cultural traditions of the two countries, promoting the friendship between the two peoples, and supporting Indonesia's anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle and the local people's welfare construction undertakings. All Overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia, including the teachers and students of Overseas Chinese schools, have always followed the teachings of the Chinese government, lived in harmony with the Indonesian people, and never interfered in Indonesia's internal political affairs. This is an obvious fact that cannot be distorted by anyone. It is very clear that the so-called Overseas Chinese schools and their sponsoring organizations "have become dens of subversives and counter-revolutionaries" is completely an excuse for the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces to deliberately worsen relations between China and Indonesia and further expand the anti-Chinese campaign. It is not worth refuting at all. It is worth mentioning that the head of the Jakarta Military Region, in Decision No. (62) issued on March 18, announced that Overseas Chinese schools in the Jakarta area would be placed under his jurisdiction, the reason being: "Recently, there has been a phenomenon of some groups taking racist measures." This fully shows that the so-called "actions of the masses of the people reflecting social anger" are not exactly the "phenomenon of racist measures taken by some groups," the atrocities of a small number of right-wing reactionary elements against China and Chinese?
    The note said that the Chinese Embassy expresses great indignation at the above-mentioned serious incidents and lodges a strong protest with the Indonesian government. The embassy requests the Indonesian government to immediately revoke the decisions of the Jakarta Military Region, the West Java Military Region, and the South Sumatra Military Region to close Overseas Chinese schools, stop the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces from attacking and occupying Overseas Chinese schools, take practical and effective measures to protect Overseas Chinese cultural and educational undertakings from infringement, and reopen all Overseas Chinese schools as soon as possible, ensure the safety of teachers and students of Overseas Chinese schools, and prevent similar incidents from occurring again.

    我国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出严正要求
    立即派船把自愿返国的受害华侨送回中国
    我最强烈抗议印尼右派非法侵占华侨团体封闭华侨学校
    新华社十二日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司副司长徐净武十二日上午召见印度尼西亚驻华大使查禾多，向他递交了中国外交部致印度尼西亚驻华大使馆的一份照会。照会对印度尼西亚右派反动势力有组织、有计划地掀起的大规模排华暴行，表示极大的愤慨。照会指出印度尼西亚政府有责任把受迫害的、自愿回国的华侨送回中国，并且要求印度尼西亚政府立即安排船只把自愿回国的华侨送回中国。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆致意，并申述如下：
    自从一九六五年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力有组织、有计划地掀起了大规模的排华运动。他们在印度尼西亚全国各个省市组织大批暴徒肆意迫害无辜华侨。成千上万华侨的住宅、商店横遭抢劫和烧毁。许多华侨社团和学校被捣毁和霸占。大批华侨遭到殴打和无理逮捕。许多华侨惨遭杀害，甚至被砍头、剖腹、肢解、烧死。对于这些暴行，一些地方的陆军当局不仅加以包庇，甚至还发给暴徒“游行示威”的准字，派遣武装人员和军用车辆，直接参与。印度尼西亚右派反动势力对华侨的种族主义迫害，粗暴地破坏了国际关系准则，达到了骇人听闻的地步。对上述暴行，中国人民感到极大的愤慨。
    世代居住在印度尼西亚的华侨，一向同印度尼西亚人民和睦相处，对印度尼西亚的经济生活作出了积极的贡献，努力促进中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系，积极支持印度尼西亚人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争。印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨，显然是为了迎合帝国主义的需要，蓄意破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国关系，破坏两国人民在反帝斗争中的团结。印度尼西亚右派反动势力无论制造怎样的借口，都掩盖不了他们这种卑鄙的阴谋。
    根据中国政府和印度尼西亚政府就两国的侨民问题所签定的有关条约和协议，印度尼西亚政府负有保护中国侨民正当权利和利益的不容推卸的义务。但是，印度尼西亚政府不仅不履行上述义务，而且听任甚至包庇右派反动势力疯狂迫害华侨，完全无视中国政府一再向印度尼西亚政府提出的抗议和交涉。最近，印度尼西亚政府通过雅加达等地的军事当局，竟然发布命令，恶毒地诬蔑华侨社团和学校为“颠覆分子和反革命巢穴”，并以此为借口，封闭和解散华侨社团和学校。这说明，印度尼西亚政府进一步支持右派反动势力迫害华侨的罪行，从而不容推卸地承担了进一步恶化两国关系的责任。
    目前已有成千上万遭受迫害的华侨，由于倾家荡产，丧失生计，迫切要求印度尼西亚政府负责协助他们返回祖国。他们的这种要求完全是合理的，也是十分正当的。印度尼西亚政府既未切实保护他们免遭迫害，又没有对他们给予救济和安置，印度尼西亚政府当然有责任把受迫害的、自愿回国的华侨送回中国。为此，中国政府要求印度尼西亚政府：
    一、立即安排船只，将上述自愿回国的华侨送回中国。
    二、允许他们携带自己的财物和资金回国。
    三、保证他们在前往港口途中的安全和负责他们在港口的食宿，协助他们顺利离开印度尼西亚回国。
    四、中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆和领事馆将指派官员协助自愿返回祖国的华侨回国的工作，希印度尼西亚政府负责保护中国官员的安全，并提供必要的方便。
    以上要求，请印度尼西亚政府迅速给予答复。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
                      中华人民共和国外交部
                        一九六六年四月十二日于北京
    新华社十二日讯　雅加达消息：中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十一日递交一份照会给印度尼西亚共和国外交部，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力组织的暴徒非法侵占雅加达、万隆、玛琅等地区华侨团体的严重事件提出最强烈的抗议。照会要求印度尼西亚政府立即制止侵占华侨团体的暴行，并保证不再发生类似事件。
    照会说，一九六六年四月八日清晨七时半，有自称“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”（卡米）和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”（卡比）的暴徒约四十余人，手持木棒、铁链、匕首等凶器，乘坐吉普车，闯入雅加达中华侨团总会，强行霸占该会所，并进行非法搜查。他们竟公然撕毁中国国旗和国家领导人的挂象，还在院内升挂印度尼西亚国旗。他们还非法扣留该会职员以及前来委托办理选籍、护照手续和来看病的华侨约一百二十余人，私设审讯室，逐一进行横蛮的审讯，强迫答复许多诬蔑中国的问题，并挥刀恫吓，强迫搜身，拳打脚踢。有的华侨被扣留和虐待达十余小时，即是妇女、老人亦不幸免。各种证件均被搜去，华侨总会和来客乘坐的汽车、摩托车二十多辆均被扣留标封。暴徒还在该会所大门和墙壁上涂满了“房屋主权属于卡比所有”以及“吊死支那人”，“赶走支那人”等等反华标语。华侨总会职员黄沐和因拒绝在暴徒拟就的移交房产的字据上签字，竟被非法绑架。
    照会说，与此同时，暴徒还分批强占了雅加达其他十个华侨团体的会所，即妇女协会、五金商公会、新生协会、民生社、永定会馆、漳属同乡会、琼侨同乡会、同益社、南安公会和永春公会。截止四月十日，中华侨团总会和其他十个华侨团体均由武装军队驻守，有些会所仍有暴徒盘踞。
    照会说，尤为骇人听闻的是，暴徒竟然公开绑架各该侨团的职员和华侨八人，载往设在由军队守备的华侨“椰城中学”的秘密刑讯室内进行逼供。在他们施以各种诱骗手段彻底失败后，即对被捕人员严刑拷打，有的被剥光衣服捆绑椅上用木棒、皮鞭猛击胸腹和下体，有的被折磨达六小时之久，几次昏迷，但始终严正抗辩，绝不屈服，即使在暴徒威胁要用电刑、要活埋，也无所畏惧。驻守在该校的军人曾一再在这所刑讯室出现，且和暴徒谈笑自若。
    照会说，在西爪哇，自三月中旬开始，据不完全的统计，万隆有华侨公会、玉融公会、广肇会馆、妇女会、南化学会、青年自然科学会、福蒲公会、三轮车公会、金商公会、永定公会等十个华侨团体的会所或礼堂被暴徒先后强占。万隆中华总会被劫走全部文卷档案，已无法进行会务工作。此外，西爪哇所属的苏加武眉、展玉、斗旺、牙律、井里汶、双木丹等地区的中华总会和其他华侨团体共十三所亦被暴徒非法强占。
    在东爪哇玛琅市，三月三十日、三十一日两天，中华总会等六个华侨团体被暴徒非法强占。
    照会说，应当郑重指出：在印度尼西亚的华侨团体，是以开展华侨福利事业为宗旨的，一贯积极支持印度尼西亚人民的反帝反殖斗争，是增进两国人民友谊的重要桥梁。各地侨团认真引导广大华侨与印度尼西亚人民和睦相处，热心支援当地各项社会福利建设事业。长期以来，还协助当地政府部门进行了许多有益的事务活动，并且早已获得了印度尼西亚政府所承认的合法团体地位，得到了社会公众的良好赞誉。照会说，印度尼西亚右派反动势力公然不顾国际法准则和国际惯例，竟在光天化日之下，在首都雅加达和其他城市，组织暴徒如此猖狂地破坏和非法侵占上述各地华侨团体，如此粗暴地侵犯华侨人权，绑架和非法刑讯无辜侨团人员。而全副武装的军队对这些暴徒的非法罪行，居然予以保护和协助，这不能不令人感到极大的愤慨！照会说，对上述严重事件，大使馆特向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议。大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取有效措施，退回被非法侵占的侨团会所，制止侵占华侨团体暴行的蔓延，追究事件的肇事者和主使人，归还被暴徒劫走的文件档案和一切财物，释放被非法扣捕的侨团职员，切实保障华侨团体及其职员的安全，保证不再发生类似事件。
    新华社十二日讯　雅加达消息：中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆十一日递交一份照会给印度尼西亚共和国外交部，就雅加达军区、西爪哇军区和南苏门答腊军区负责人悍然下令封闭所辖地区华侨学校的严重事件，提出强烈的抗议。
    照会说，一九六六年四月五日，第五军区负责人以雅加达特区两项人民命令掌权者的名义，发布了第（DU）号决定书，悍然封闭雅加达地区的全部华侨学校，强令解散主办这些学校的机构，并宣布这些华侨学校和主办机构都是被禁止的单位。这位军区负责人还擅自将华侨学校的所谓“清理工作”交付印度尼西亚基础教育和文化部处理。尤其令人愤慨的是，雅加达军区负责人竟然在其决定书中，不顾事实，无中生有，凭空捏造，对华侨学校及其主办机构蓄意进行恶毒的诽谤。说什么这些华侨学校及其主办机构在“十一事件”的前奏和尾声中，“成为颠覆分子和反革命分子的巢穴”，因而“出现了反映社会愤怒的人民群众的行动，这些行动全都指向上述学校”。拆穿说来，雅加达军事当局为了掩饰其无理措施，特地制造了这种莫须有的罪名，强加于华侨学校及其主办机构。
    在决定书发布的第二天即四月六日，雅加达军事当局派出了荷枪实弹的武装部队，会同右派组织的暴徒，分头强行查封雅加达地区所有的五十一所华侨学校，其中计有高中四所，初中十三所，小学二十五所，幼儿园九所。致使四万多名华侨学生和一千四百多名教师失学失业。
    照会说，一九六六年四月七日，第六军区负责人以西爪哇两项人民命令掌权者的名义，也发布了决定书，悍然封闭其所辖地区的全部华侨学校。在此之前，即自三月十二日开始，西爪哇地区的华侨学校，已经先后受到了右派反动势力组织的暴徒的袭击破坏和非法侵占，大使馆曾就此向印度尼西亚政府提出严正交涉，但毫无结果。显然，暴徒的非法侵占和军事当局的悍然封闭是有预谋、有计划的配合行动，是右派反动势力自己也不讳言的事实。
    照会说，大使馆并获悉，早在三月三十日，第四军区负责人以南苏门答腊两项人民命令掌权者的名义，下令封闭了所辖地区的全部华侨学校。照会说，众所周知，在印度尼西亚的华侨学校，是华侨子弟谋求知识的场所，长期以来都领有印度尼西亚政府的合法执照，接受印度尼西亚文教当局的监督和协助，不仅是国际法准则和国际惯例所承认的正当侨民权益，也是印度尼西亚政府理应加以保护的华侨文教事业。在中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国建交以后，华侨学校在沟通两国文化传统，促进两国人民的友谊，支持印度尼西亚反帝反殖斗争和当地人民的福利建设事业上，都作出了积极的贡献。在印度尼西亚侨居的全体华侨，包括华侨学校的师生在内，一贯遵循中国政府的教导，同印度尼西亚人民和睦相处，从不干预印度尼西亚内部的政治事务，这是有目共睹的事实，不容任何人加以歪曲。十分明显，所谓华侨学校及其主办机构“已成为颠覆分子和反革命分子的巢穴”的说法，完全是印度尼西亚右派反动势力蓄意恶化中国和印度尼西亚两国关系，进一步扩大反华排华的借口，根本不值一驳。值得提出的是，雅加达军区负责人在三月十八日发布的第（62）号决定书中，曾宣布将雅加达地区的华侨学校置于其管辖之下，其理由是：“最近出现了一部分集团采取种族主义措施的现象”。这就完全说明了所谓“反映社会愤怒的人民群众的行动”，不正好是“一部分集团所采取的种族主义措施的现象”、一小撮右派反动分子反华排华的暴行吗？
    照会说，中国大使馆对上述严重事件表示莫大的愤慨，特向印度尼西亚政府提出强烈抗议。大使馆要求印度尼西亚政府立即撤销雅加达军区、西爪哇军区和南苏门答腊军区封闭华侨学校的决定书，制止印度尼西亚右派反动势力对华侨学校的袭击和侵占，采取切实有效的措施，保护华侨文教事业不受侵犯，并尽快使所有华侨学校开学复课，保证华侨学校师生的安全，并不再发生类似事件。
