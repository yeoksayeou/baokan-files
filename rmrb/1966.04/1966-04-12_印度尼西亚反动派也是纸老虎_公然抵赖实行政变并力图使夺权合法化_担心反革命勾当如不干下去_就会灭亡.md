    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 11th – Jakarta news: The ringleaders of Indonesia's right-wing generals' clique, Suharto and Nasution, have recently been clamoring for general elections and the election of a vice president in order to give the right-wing generals' clique's seizure of state power through a coup d'état a veneer of legitimacy.
    According to reports from Antara News Agency and Western news agencies, Suharto publicly announced at a press conference on the 6th that the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly "is discussing the people's demands: that the positions of president and vice president should be strictly in accordance with the (1945) Constitution." "If the situation permits, a vice president will be elected."
    At this press conference, Suharto admitted that in Indonesia, "all administrative power is firmly concentrated in the hands of himself, Malik, and Buwono." However, he denied the undeniable fact that a coup d'état had occurred in Indonesia, "the military taking over power, and Indonesia turning to the right." He sophistically argued, "In Indonesia, the question of whether the armed forces should be above or below the administrative organs does not arise. Therefore, if you define the participation of the armed forces in the government as a coup or interference in administration according to the standards of other countries, it is wrong, or at least incorrect."
    Suharto unreservedly revealed the right-wing generals' clique's ambition to control the Gotong Royong Parliament (Mutual Cooperation Parliament). He said that the Indonesian Army "should participate collectively with other groups in the Gotong Royong Parliament in order to complete the revolution." In another speech, he also clamored to "continue the struggle; if we interrupt it, we will perish; if we retreat, we will be destroyed."
    According to a report from Jakarta Radio, Nasution said at a meeting of the executive committee of the Indonesian Islamic Trade Union Federation on the 6th that the government and the Gotong Royong Parliament should consider holding general elections within three years at the latest "to ensure political stability and improve guided democracy." He said that the seats in the Gotong Royong Parliament left vacant due to the dismissal of "communists and other counter-revolutionaries" should be filled by the "progressive revolutionary generation of 1966." In another speech, he revealed that the "generation of 1966" he was referring to was the "Indonesian University Students Action Union" and the "Indonesian Youth and Students Action Union," which had been frantically conducting anti-communist and anti-people riots throughout Indonesia since the September 30th Movement.
    Just as Suharto and Nasution were giving their speeches, the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique had already taken action to strengthen its control over the Gotong Royong Parliament and the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly. According to Antara News Agency, the Indonesian Parliament on the 8th "had expelled sixty-two members of parliament suspected of engaging in pro-communist activities," and they "were also disqualified from membership in the People's Consultative Assembly."

### 印度尼西亚反动派也是纸老虎  公然抵赖实行政变并力图使夺权合法化  担心反革命勾当如不干下去“就会灭亡”

    印度尼西亚反动派也是纸老虎
    公然抵赖实行政变并力图使夺权合法化
    担心反革命勾当如不干下去“就会灭亡”
    新华社十一日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团的头目苏哈托和纳苏蒂安，最近连续叫嚷要举行大选和选举副总统，以便给右派将领集团用政变夺取国家政权披上合法的外衣。
    据安塔拉通讯社和西方通讯社报道，苏哈托六日在一次记者招待会上公开宣布，临时人民协商会议“正在讨论人民的要求：对于总统和副总统的职位，应当严格按照（一九四五年）宪法行事。”“如果局势许可，将选出一名副总统”。
    苏哈托在这次记者招待会上承认，印度尼西亚“所有行政权都牢牢地集中在他本人、马利克和布沃诺手中”。但是他又抵赖在印度尼西亚发生了政变，“军人接管政权，印度尼西亚向右转”这个无可辩驳的事实。他狡赖说，“在印度尼西亚，并不发生武装部队应当高于还是低于行政机构的问题。因此，如果你按照其它国家的标准定义，把武装部队参加政府看作是政变或是对行政的干涉，那是错误的，至少也是不正确的。”
    苏哈托毫不隐讳地道出右派将领集团要控制合作国会的野心。他说，印度尼西亚陆军“应当同其它团体集体地参加合作国会，以便完成革命”。他在另一次讲话中，还叫嚷要“继续斗争下去，如果中断我们就会灭亡；后退，我们就会毁灭。”
    据雅加达电台报道，纳苏蒂安六日在印度尼西亚伊斯兰工会联合会执行委员会会议上发表讲话说，政府和合作国会应该考虑最迟在三年之内举行大选，“以保证政治上的稳定和改善有领导的民主。”他说，合作国会中由于解除“共产党和其他反革命分子”的职务而空出来的席位，应该由“进步的革命的一九六六年的一代”来补充。他在另一次讲话中透露，他所说的“一九六六年的一代”，就是从九月三十日事件以来在印度尼西亚全国各地疯狂进行反共、反人民骚乱活动的“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”和“印度尼西亚青年学生统一行动组织”。
    就在苏哈托和纳苏蒂安发表讲话的时候，印度尼西亚右派将领集团已经在采取行动，加强对合作国会和临时人民协商会议的控制。据安塔拉通讯社报道，印度尼西亚国会在八日“已经开除有从事亲共活动嫌疑的六十二名议员”，他们“还被取消了人民协商会议的成员资格”。
