    Vegetable Production Has Successors
    ——A Record of the Changchun Erdaohazi District Semi-Agricultural and Semi-Study Horticultural School
    The Changchun Erdaohazi District Horticultural School is a semi-agricultural and semi-study technical school located in the near suburbs of the city. It was founded in February 1960 and has been in existence for six years.
    Erdaohazi District is an important base for vegetable production in Changchun City, but it lacks technical expertise. The original vegetable technicians were mostly older vegetable farmers with limited education. There is an urgent need to train young technicians to meet the needs of vegetable production development. Therefore, the district party committee and the district people's committee decided to jointly establish this horticultural school by the eight collective ownership farms under the district's jurisdiction to cultivate new types of laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and vegetable production skills.
    The first group of students were young commune members with a primary school education selected by the farms. After graduation, they returned to the farms to work. After 1962, it was changed to recruiting junior high school graduates from the city, implementing "coming from the city and going to the commune." Currently, there are three classes in the first and second grades, with 160 students.
    This school has promoted the revolutionary spirit of diligence and frugality in running the school and self-reliance. Over the past few years, teachers and students have built ten simple school buildings, renovated 800 square meters of school buildings, built 550 square meters of dormitories and livestock sheds, built two greenhouses, leveled and improved more than 20 mu of garden land, and reclaimed more than 30 mu of wasteland. It still maintains the spirit of diligence and frugality in running the school, with teachers ringing the bell and sweeping the floor, and students taking turns helping with cooking, feeding pigs, and grazing horses.
    Graduates Do Whatever They Are Told
    For six years, the Erdaohazi District Horticultural School has adhered to serving the countryside, implemented the party's education policy, and achieved some results. There are currently two groups of graduates, a total of 129 people, most of whom are content to work in agricultural production and have taken on various jobs according to the needs of production. Among them, 19 have been selected as advanced producers, and 40 have been selected as commune member representatives. They have played an active role in the socialist revolution and socialist construction in the countryside.
    Xu Xiangyao, a first-term graduate, graduated from the Horticultural School in September 1962 and returned to the Xinchen Farm. He started working in the greenhouse, then was sent to the second team as a technician, then to the pumping station as an electrician, and recently transferred to the tenth team as a work recorder. In all his work, he can work hard, learn modestly, and work very well. Currently, he has mastered the skills of seed soaking, seedling cultivation, transplanting, field management, pump maintenance, work point evaluation, and accounting and distribution. Commune members reflected: "Horticultural school graduates are easy to use, they do whatever they are told, and they do everything well. They are 'empty code blocks' – they can be used wherever they are needed."
    Li Mingcheng, a second-term graduate, was assigned to the Hongwei Farm in September 1965 and worked as a greenhouse intern technician in the fifth team, and also served as a Mao Zedong Thought study instructor. He ate, lived, and worked with the commune members. In the busiest season of vegetable production, he led the commune members in studying "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," which enhanced the ideological consciousness of the masses, inspired their enthusiasm, and overcame the difficulty of labor shortage, resulting in a bumper harvest of spring and summer vegetables, creating a high-yield record of 19,500 jin per mu, becoming a model field in the city. Last winter, Li Mingcheng was selected as an advanced producer of the farm. Recently, he was transferred to the first team as a political captain.
    Educating Students to Aspire to Farming
    The school pays great attention to conducting ideological education for students to aspire to farming. Many of the first group of young commune members from the farms lacked a clear purpose for learning and lacked the perseverance and habits for studying. The second group recruited junior high school graduates from the city, whose main problems were that they looked down on farmers and agricultural labor and were not prepared to engage in farming for the long term. From the first day they entered the school, the school conducted education for them that farming is also doing revolution, organized students to study Chairman Mao's "Serve the People" and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" and other articles, invited old poor peasants with deep hatred and bitter feuds to make reports, studied the deeds of advanced educated youth such as Dong Jiageng and Liu Changyin, and cultivated students' labor views, labor habits, and the ideological feelings of the working people through labor training.
    In order to allow students to receive more direct training and further establish the idea of serving agriculture, students during their time at the school, the first two years work in the school's production base, and the last year go down to the farm production team to eat, live, and work with the commune members, directly contacting poor and lower-middle peasants, receiving the ideological edification of the working people, and preparing for orientation to the countryside after graduation.
    Reforming Teaching from the Actual Production
    According to the training objectives and the principle of "less but finer," and proceeding from the actual production, the school has carried out great reforms in teaching. The professional course mainly focuses on vegetable cultivation. The teaching sequence of vegetable cultivation is arranged according to the agricultural season. The teaching content focuses on the crops produced locally, mainly covering the cultivation methods of more than 40 varieties of 18 categories of vegetables commonly planted in this city and district. At the same time, attention is also paid to adopting new production technologies and the experience of veteran farmers.
    In terms of teaching methods, on-site teaching and physical object teaching have been strengthened, and a three-way combination of teachers, technicians, and veteran farmers has been implemented. A lecture is held about once a month, inviting veteran farmers with rich experience in vegetable cultivation in this district and technicians from the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences to give lectures at the school. Generally, after the teacher finishes lecturing on a chapter of theoretical knowledge, the veteran farmers are invited to talk about detailed and skillful work, talk about the actual situation in the district and their own operating experience. Students reflected: This teaching method leaves a deep impression and is unforgettable.
    The school's teachers all practice teaching while farming. They work with students during concentrated labor periods. Usually, according to the teaching workload, they work one or two days a week. Each teacher works 60 to 80 days throughout the year. Professional course teachers all participate in vegetable production labor. After several years of teaching while farming, their ideological feelings have changed, and they have learned the main farm work.
    Master Theoretical Knowledge and Learn Operating Skills
    The school also pays great attention to cultivating students' labor skills. They unify the production organization and the class organization, with one class being one production team. The homeroom teacher serves as the production team leader, and the class leader serves as the deputy leader. Each class is equipped with a production guidance teacher who serves as a technician. Students learn farm work, in addition to learning the cultivation methods of various crops in the teaching process, they mainly learn through ordinary labor, under the specific guidance of the production guidance teacher. During labor, the production guidance teacher first explains the essentials and makes demonstrations, and then the students actually operate, and individual guidance is given so that each student can operate. Students' operating skills and theoretical knowledge are both included in the performance evaluation. After classroom learning and operational training, most students can independently carry out field management upon graduation, and generally can do more than 20 kinds of farm work, most reaching the level of intern technicians, and a few reaching the level of technicians.
    Over the past few years, this school has carried out some scientific experiment activities in combination with teaching and production. They have successively conducted many introduction experiments of excellent varieties from other places. Currently, there are more than a dozen new varieties that are retained and suitable for local growth conditions, such as cabbage, cowpea, pepper, and cucumber. They adopted a three-way combination of teachers, students, and veteran farmers to conduct soil surveys on more than 130 mu of land on campus. On the basis of the investigation, some soil improvement experiments were carried out. They have also done experiments on cucumber seed freezing, cucumber sand cultivation, and tomato seed dry heat treatment. In scientific experiment activities, they also helped the farm solve some problems in promoting new vegetable production technologies. Through the above methods, students have become new types of laborers with socialist consciousness, culture, and technology. Changchun City Education Bureau Working Group

    蔬菜生产后继有人
    ——记市来社去的长春二道河子区半农半读园艺学校
    长春市二道河子区园艺学校，是在城市近郊办的一所半农半读技术学校。一九六○年二月创办，到现在已有六年的历史。
    二道河子区是长春市蔬菜生产的重要基地之一，但是技术力量比较缺乏。原有的蔬菜技术人员，大都是年龄大、文化低的老菜农，急需培养青年技术人员，以适应蔬菜生产发展的需要。因此，区委和区人委决定，由区属八个集体所有制农场联合举办这所园艺学校，培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化、有蔬菜生产技能的新型劳动者。
    第一期的学生是由农场选送的具有高小文化程度的青年社员，毕业后仍然回到农场劳动。一九六二年以后，改为从城市招收初中毕业生，实行“市来社去”。现有一、二年级三个班，一百六十名学生。
    这所学校在办学中发扬了勤俭办学、自力更生的革命精神。几年来，师生动手盖起了十间简易校舍，整修了八百平方米的校舍，新建了五百五十平方米的宿舍和畜舍，盖起了两栋温室，平整和改良了二十多亩园田，开出了三十多亩荒地。现在仍然保持勤俭办学的精神，教师打铃、扫地，学生轮流助炊、喂猪、放马。
    叫毕业生干啥就干啥
    二道河子区园艺学校，六年来坚持面向农村，贯彻执行了党的教育方针，取得了一些成绩。现有两期毕业生共一百二十九人，他们绝大部分都安心农业生产，并且根据生产的需要，担任了各方面的工作。其中，有十九名被选为先进生产者，有四十名被选为社员代表。他们在农村社会主义革命和社会主义建设中发挥了积极作用。
    第一期毕业生徐向尧，一九六二年九月从园艺学校毕业，回到新晨农场。开始在温室劳动，以后派到二队当技术员，后来到抽水站当电工，最近又调到十队做记工员。他在各项工作中，都能埋头苦干，虚心学习，工作很出色。目前，他已掌握了浸种、育苗、定植、田间管理、维修水泵、评工记分、核算分配等本领。社员反映：“园艺学校毕业生，使用顺手，给什么干什么，干什么象什么，是‘空心码子’——哪用哪到。”
    第二期毕业生李明成，一九六五年九月分配到宏伟农场，在五队做温室见习技术员，并兼任毛主席著作学习辅导员。他和社员同吃、同住、同劳动。他在蔬菜生产最忙的季节，领着社员三学《愚公移山》，提高了群众的思想觉悟，激发了干劲，克服了劳力不足的困难，使春夏两季的蔬菜生产获得双丰收，创造了亩产一万九千五百斤的高产纪录，成为市的一个样板田。去年冬天李明成被选为农场的先进生产者。最近调到一队担任政治队长。
    教育学生立志务农
    学校很注意对学生进行立志务农的思想教育。学校第一期来自农场的青年社员，不少人学习目的不够明确，缺乏学习毅力和习惯。第二期招收的是城市的初中毕业生，他们的主要问题是轻视农民和农业劳动，没有长期务农的思想准备。学校从他们入学的第一天起，就向他们进行种田也是干革命的教育，组织学生学习毛主席的《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，请苦大仇深的老贫农作家史报告，学习董加耕、柳昌银等先进知识青年的事迹，并通过劳动锻炼，培养学生的劳动观点、劳动习惯和劳动人民的思想感情。
    为了让学生更直接地受到锻炼，进一步树立务农的思想，学生在校期间，前两年在校内生产基地劳动，最后一年下放到农场生产队，和社员同吃、同住、同劳动，直接和贫下中农接触，受劳动人民的思想熏陶，为毕业后导向农村做好准备。
    从生产实际出发改革教学
    学校根据培养目标和少而精的原则，并从生产实际出发，在教学上进行了很大的改革。专业课以蔬菜栽培为主。蔬菜栽培的教学次序，是按农事季节编排的。教学内容以当地生产的作物为主，主要讲本市、本区经常种植的十八类、四十多个品种蔬菜的栽培方法。同时，还注意采用新的生产技术和老农的经验。
    在教学方法上，加强了现场教学和实物教学，实行教师、技术人员和老农三结合。一个月左右举行一次讲座，请本区富有蔬菜栽培经验的老农和省农业科学研究所的技术人员来校讲课。一般是教师讲完一章理论知识后，请老农来讲细活、巧活，讲本区的实际情况和本人的操作经验。学生反映：这种教法印象深刻，忘不了。
    学校的教师都实行了边农边教。他们在学生集中劳动期间，同学生一起劳动。平时按照教学负担情况，每周劳动一天或两天。每个教师全年劳动六十到八十天。专业课教师都参加蔬菜生产劳动。经过几年的边农边教，思想感情发生了变化，学会了主要的农活。
    学好理论知识，学会操作技能
    学校也很注意培养学生的劳动技能。他们把生产组织和班级组织统一起来，一个班就是一个生产队。班主任担任生产队长，班长担任副队长。每班配备一名生产指导教师，担任技术员。学生学习农活，除在教学过程中学习各种作物的栽培方法外，主要是通过平时劳动，在生产指导教师的具体指导下进行学习。在劳动时，先由生产指导教师讲清要领，作出示范，再由学生实际操作，个别加以指导，使每个学生都会操作。学生的操作技术与理论知识都列入成绩考核。经过课堂学习和操作训练，学生毕业时，大多数能够独立进行田间管理，一般会做二十几种农活，多数达到见习技术员水平，少数达到技术员水平。
    几年来，这个学校结合教学，结合生产，开展了一些科学试验活动。他们先后进行了不少外地优良品种的引进实验。现在保留下来适合本地生长条件的有甘蓝、豆角、辣椒、黄瓜等十几个新品种。他们采取了教师、学生和老农三结合的办法，对校内一百三十多亩土地做了土壤调查。在调查的基础上，进行了一些土壤改良试验。他们还做过黄瓜种子冷冻、黄瓜沙培、西红柿种子干热处理等试验。他们在科学试验活动中，还帮助农场解决推广蔬菜生产新技术的一些问题。通过以上种种办法，使学生成为有社会主义觉悟的，有文化的、有技术的新型劳动者。　长春市教育局工作组
