    The teacher should lead the students well, the master should lead the apprentices well, the commander should lead the troops well, and the leaders of a unit should lead the cadres and the masses well. This word "lead" is extremely important.
    Cultivating advanced individuals, establishing "models," and using the power of role models to inspire the masses to move forward is a very good method of "leading." But never forget that leaders themselves are also "models." The "model" of the masses can be selected one out of a hundred, or one out of a thousand, but the "model" of the leader is a matter of course, and there is no way to decline it. If you are a leader, you are a "model." Wherever you go, this "model" goes with you. In the eyes of the masses, since you are a leader, you must study Chairman Mao's works relatively well, and your ideological cultivation must be relatively high, so they will learn from you. "Fighting a war depends on the flag, and work depends on the leadership!"
    "Peaches and plums do not speak, yet a path is formed beneath them." The "model" role of leadership is invisible and silent, but it has a far-reaching influence. Wang Jinxi, the Iron Man of Daqing, once saw a worker using his hand to grab oil to wipe a machine, and then wiping the oily hand on his clothes. He investigated the source of this bad habit. Unexpectedly, the investigation led back to himself. It turned out that the Iron Man had unknowingly "led" it in the past. From this small incident, we can see how important it is for a leader to set a good example at all times, in all matters, and in all places. Some people say: By looking at the atmosphere of a unit, you can infer the leadership's ideology and work style. This is very true.
    Leaders are not only "models," but also "models of models." What does this mean? If you lack advanced ideas yourself, you cannot discover the advanced individuals among the masses. Even if you find them, you cannot lead them with your own good ideas and good work style, so that they quickly become a bright flag. In this sense, leadership is the most important "model." The novel "Ouyang Hai's Song" has a very profound depiction of this aspect. Ouyang Hai always regarded the company commander and political instructor as "models." Political Instructor Zeng Wujun, who had great aspirations and worked wholeheartedly for the Party, still left Ouyang Hai with endless things to learn and use even after being injured on duty and transferred from the company: "Instructor! A revolutionary, a Communist Party member, should be like you." When encountering difficulties, Ouyang Hai would recall how the instructor usually worked and how he handled problems. The heroic models and advanced individuals who are emerging on all fronts are growing up in this way under the sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought and under the teachings of thousands of Zeng Wujuns.
    If leaders want to lead the team well, they must take the lead in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. At the same time, they must humbly listen to the criticisms of the masses, strictly demand themselves, and constantly overcome their shortcomings. The role of example is multifaceted, but these two points can be said to be the most important.

    最重要的“样板”
    方天白
    老师要带好学生，师傅要带好徒弟，指挥员要带好队伍，一个单位的领导要带好干部和群众。这个“带”字，真是重要极了。
    培养先进，树立“样板”，用榜样的力量鼓舞群众前进，这是很好的“带”的方法。但千万不要忘记了，领导者自己也是“样板”。在群众中树“样板”，可以百中挑一，千中挑一，领导者自己这块“样板”，却是理所当然，想谦让也谦让不了的。你是领导，你就是“样板”，你走到哪里，这块“样板”就带到哪里。在群众的眼里，既然是领导，毛主席著作一定是学得比较好的，思想修养一定是比较高的，他们就要向你学。“打仗看旗帜，工作看领导”嘛！
    “桃李无言，下自成蹊”。领导的“样板”作用是无形的，无声的，但却是影响深远的。大庆铁人王进喜有一次看到一个工人擦机器用手抓油，又将满手的油擦在衣服上。他就追查这坏习惯的来源。谁想一查两查，查到自己头上来了。那原来是铁人过去在不知不觉中“带”出来的。从这件小事，也可以看到，一个领导者时时、事事、处处以身作则，做出好榜样来，是何等重要。有人说：看一个单位的风气，就可以推知这个单位的领导思想和作风。这是很有道理的。
    领导者不但是“样板”，而且还是“样板的样板”。这话怎么讲？你自己缺少先进思想，就不可能去发现群众中的先进人物。就是找到了，也不能以自己的好思想、好作风来带领他，使他很快地成为一面鲜艳的旗帜。在这个意义上说，领导就是最重要的“样板”。小说《欧阳海之歌》在这方面有很深刻的描写。欧阳海就是时时刻刻以连长、指导员为“样板”的。胸怀远大，全心全意为党工作的指导员曾武军，就是在因公负伤、调离连队以后，也仍然在欧阳海心上留下了学不完、用不完的东西：“指导员呵！一个革命者，一个共产党员，就应该象你这样”。在遇到困难的时候，欧阳海就回想起指导员平素是怎么工作的，是怎么处理问题的。我们各条战线上风起云涌的英雄模范、先进人物，就是这样地在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，在成千上万个曾武军的言教和身教下，成长起来的。
    领导要带好队伍，首先必须在活学活用毛主席著作方面起带头作用。同时要虚心听取群众批评，严格要求自己，不断克服缺点。榜样的作用是多方面的，但这两条，可以说是最重要的吧。
