    Shanghai Manufactures Small High-Precision Semi-Automatic Universal Cylindrical Grinding Machine
    Machined Workpiece Quality Reaches Highest Level of Current Grinding Machine Processing
    A small, high-precision, semi-automatic universal cylindrical grinding machine used for "mirror grinding" has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shanghai Third Machine Tool Factory.
    Trial grinding proves that workpieces processed with this grinding machine have an outer circle smoothness of grade 14 and an inner circle smoothness of grade 13, both reaching the highest level of current grinding machine processing.
    This small, high-precision semi-automatic universal cylindrical grinding machine can process parts with outer circle diameters as small as five millimeters, requiring very high smoothness and precision. Its successful trial production provides new equipment for the instrumentation, electrical appliance, and radio industries. Previously, the first high-precision semi-automatic universal cylindrical grinding machine in China capable of "mirror grinding," successfully trial-produced by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, could only process larger workpieces with outer circle diameters of eight millimeters or more; now the range of processed workpieces has become even wider.

    上海制成小型高精度半自动万能外圆磨床
    加工工件质量达到目前磨床加工的最高一级
    用来作“镜面磨削”的小型高精度半自动万能外圆磨床，最近在上海第三机床厂试制成功。
    试磨证明，用这种磨床加工出来的工件，外圆光洁度为十四级，内圆光洁度为十三级，都达到了目前磨床加工的最高一级。
    这种小型高精度半自动万能外圆磨床，能加工规格小到外圆直径为五毫米、要求有很高的光洁度和精度的零件。它的试制成功，为仪表、电器、无线电等工业提供了新的装备。在此以前，上海机床厂试制成功的我国第一台能作“镜面磨削”的高精度半自动万能外圆磨床，只能加工外圆直径在八毫米以上的较大规格工件，现在加工的工件的范围就更广了。
