    突出政治按毛泽东思想办企业
    大庆经验学习班开课
    新华社十五日讯　为了贯彻全国工业交通工作会议和政治工作会议的精神，广泛开展学大庆、创五好的比学赶帮超运动，实现企业革命化；为了把大庆突出政治、按毛泽东思想办企业的基本经验学到手，创造更多的大庆式企业，国家经委、中共中央工交政治部和全国总工会联合举办了大庆经验学习班。学习班已于四月十日在大庆正式开始，参加学习的有一百多个企业的领导干部共一千多人。
    这次学习班将坚决贯彻党中央和毛主席关于突出政治的指示，通过学大庆，明确认识并且正确解决什么是按毛泽东思想办企业、为什么必须按毛泽东思想办企业以及怎样按毛泽东思想办企业等问题。学习班将系统学习大庆油田突出政治、按毛泽东思想办企业的经验，特别是重点学习大庆领导干部革命化的经验，正确认识和解决政治与生产、政治与技术、政治与业务的关系的经验，用毛泽东思想带出一支非常无产阶级化的革命队伍的经验。
    学习班将坚持理论联系实际的方法，自始至终反复学习毛主席的有关著作，以毛泽东思想为指针，以大庆为榜样，以两分法为武器，通过参观、蹲点、跟班劳动、跟班工作，边学边议，找差距，查原因，组织辩论，总结经验。即在毛泽东思想指导下实践，然后再把实践总结上升到毛泽东思想的高度去认识。
    中共中央工交政治部副主任钟民、李人林，全国总工会书记处书记黄民伟等参加了学习班的开学典礼。钟民同志就学习大庆经验的重大意义等问题作了重要讲话。他指出，在整个学习过程中要突出政治，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，要在自觉革命的基础上，扎扎实实地深入实践，把大庆经验真正学到手，创造出更多的大庆式企业来。
    学习班的同志热情很高，决心以整风精神严格要求自己。他们提出：一定要勇于自我革命，把自己“摆进去”，把观点亮出来，“做大庆人，取大庆经”，让大庆经验在各地开花结果。
