　　“The Whole World Collapsed”
　　——American Officer's Wail After Being Bombed
　　A dispatch from Saigon on the 1st by the Associated Press reported on the frantic escape of the invading American military officers when the American military officer dormitory was attacked and exploded by the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. Excerpts are translated below:

　　"I thought it was all over, the whole world collapsed."
　　This is the feeling of U.S. Navy Lieutenant Edgar Dowling about the fierce explosion at the Victoria Hotel officer's dormitory before dawn on Friday.
　　Dowling was sleeping in his room upstairs in the building when the Viet Cong terrorist squad attacked.
　　He said, "I immediately got up when I heard the gunfire. I looked out the window, and there were tracer bullets everywhere. A grenade exploded, followed by a sound like a landmine."
　　Lieutenant James McGoodwin had long anticipated such an attack.
　　"I used to live on the ground floor - Room Seven - my wife wrote to me and said it would be better to move to another room, so I moved; I was in my room on the seventh floor when the explosion occurred.
　　"I ran to the hallway between the sixth and seventh floors, thinking it would be safer there, and held my head tightly. Then the whole wall disappeared, and I could see the street."
　　Warrant Officer William Reeves survived in his ground floor room, although almost everything in his room was shattered.
　　Reeves said he felt "like there had been an earthquake."
　　All residents of this dormitory had been told what measures to take in the event of an attack.
　　Navy Major Charles Moore said: "I had considered that something like this would happen, we all knew the emergency measures.
　　"I immediately ran to the shower after hearing the shooting, and grabbed the shower curtain around me. The door was blown open, and glass shards were scattered all over the room."
　　Another officer expressed dissatisfaction with what he considered to be inadequate security measures.
　　He said, "They recently removed a row of large barrels that formed a barrier."

### “整个世界塌陷了”——美军官挨炸后的哀鸣

专栏：外论摘要

    “整个世界塌陷了”
    ——美军官挨炸后的哀鸣
      美联社一日从西贡发出的电讯，报道了美国军官宿舍被南越人民武装袭击和爆炸时，侵越美军军官慌乱逃命的狼狈相，摘译如下：
    “我以为一切都完了，整个世界塌陷了。”
    这是美国海军中尉埃德加·道林对星期五黎明前维多利亚饭店军官宿舍的猛烈爆炸的感受。
    越共恐怖分子小队袭击时，道林正在这座建筑物的楼上自己的房间里睡觉。
    他说：“我听见枪声就立即起床。我从窗子向外面一看，到处都是曳光弹。一枚手榴弹爆炸了，接着爆发了象是地雷的响声。”
    詹姆斯·麦古德温少尉早就想到会发生这样的袭击。
    “我原来一直住在底层——七号房间——我的妻子曾写信对我说，最好搬个房间，我就搬了；爆炸时我在七层楼上我的房间里。
    “我奔至六楼到七楼之间的楼道，认为那里保险，紧紧抱住脑袋。接着整个墙壁不见了，我能够看见市街”。
    一级准尉威廉·里夫在他的底层房间里保住了命，虽然他的房间里的几乎一切东西都炸碎了。
    里夫说，他感到“好象发生了地震”。
    这个宿舍的全体住宿者曾经被告知一旦发生袭击时应采取的措施。
    查尔斯·穆尔海军少校说：“我曾考虑到发生这样的事情，我们都知道应急措施。
    “我听到射击声后立即跑到淋浴间，一把抓住我周围的淋浴幕帘。门被炸开了，玻璃飞散室内遍地。”
    另一名军官对他认为安全措施不足的现象表示不满。
    他说：“他们最近搬开了形成一道屏障的一排大桶”。
