　　According to Xinhua News Agency, the Ministry of State Farms and Land Reclamation recently commended five state-owned farms, pointing out that they are models for all farms nationwide. It called on farms in all regions to further carry out the "compare, learn, catch up, help, and surpass" movement, and to create new achievements in the first year of the Third Five-Year Plan.

　　The five farms commended are: Jiangxi Hetang Reclamation Farm, Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Fourth Division Twelfth Regiment Farm, Guangdong Zhujiang Farm, Jiangsu Nantong Farm, and Guangdong Dongtai Farm. The common characteristics of these farms are: they are good at highlighting politics in their work, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao’s writings, and using Mao Zedong Thought to command all work; they dare to break through foreign frameworks and old frameworks, and steadfastly follow their own path in farm construction, proceeding from China’s specific conditions. Because they have highlighted politics, constantly armed workers and masses with Mao Zedong Thought, and combined revolutionary spirit with scientific attitude, these five farms have made remarkable achievements in production, construction, and business management.

　　Hetang Reclamation Farm is a red flag in state-owned farms for highly promoting the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and building a new socialist mountainous area with diligence and thrift. Established eight years ago, this reclamation farm united the people in the mountainous area, bravely marched into the natural world, and revolutionized barren mountains, poor fields, and low yields, transforming a once desolate and poor mountain valley into a prosperous new socialist mountainous area. In 1965, the farm's grain yield per mu reached 801 jin, more than double that of 1957 when the farm was established. In the eight years up to 1965, the farm transferred more than 1.7 million jin of commercial grain to the state; accumulated 1.18 million yuan in funds for the state, with an investment recovery rate of 250%.

　　This reclamation farm was established by several hundred cadres who went to the mountains. They overcame various difficulties encountered in life and production in the early stage of construction, and conquered one mountain after another with tenacious revolutionary will and realistic scientific attitude. Over the past eight years, they correctly handled and resolved the dialectical relationship between mountains, water, and fields – "to manage fields, one must manage mountains, using forests to promote grain; to manage mountains, one must manage fields, using grain to support forests; to manage fields, one must manage water, using water to protect grain; to manage water, one must manage mountains, using mountains to protect water" – and transformed more than 3,000 mu of low-yield farmland, distributed in more than 380 ridges and only able to grow one season, into drought and flood-resistant, stable and high-yield farmland that can grow two seasons a year, enabling production to develop year by year and achieve continuous increases in production. At the same time, they also developed diversified operations in the mountainous area, expanded production channels; continuously improved enterprise management, paid attention to diligence and thrift in many ways, and achieved more income, less expenditure, and annual profits. They also vigorously helped and supported the surrounding people's communes in terms of politics and technology, and were praised as the "Dazhai of the land reclamation front."

　　Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps Fourth Division Twelfth Regiment Farm is a mechanized state-owned farm mainly engaged in agriculture, combining agriculture and animal husbandry, and developing diversified operations in an all-round way. It is a red flag for stable and high yields in state-owned farms in the Northwest region. This farm is mainly composed of demobilized officers and soldiers. They maintained and carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the People's Liberation Army. With the revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude of daring to struggle and daring to win, after fourteen years of hard work, they used methods such as ditching and drainage, using water to suppress salt, lowering the groundwater level, and increasing fertilizer application, to transform more than 100,000 mu of saline-alkali wasteland on the banks of the Gongnais River into fertile farmland, so that the average grain yield per mu exceeded the target stipulated in the "National Agricultural Development Program" as early as 1961.

　　This farm puts politics first in all its work, uses politics to command business, and vigorously carries out activities to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao’s writings, and firmly grasps living ideas, thereby continuously improving the class consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm of workers and staff, and a lively situation has emerged in various tasks. Located in an area inhabited by ethnic minorities, the workers and staff here pay great attention to strengthening unity with ethnic minorities and assisting them in developing production, truly playing the role of "production team, work team, and fighting team."

　　Zhujiang Farm is famous for its spirit of continuous revolution, persistently studying science and technology, innovating cultivation techniques, and achieving large-scale increases in rice production year after year. In 1963, the farm's rice yield per mu reached more than 1,000 jin, becoming a high-yield flag for state-owned farm rice production.

　　This farm is located in the Wanquingsha area formed by the alluvial deposits of the Pearl River Estuary. Before liberation, the people there were poor and the land was barren, and the rice yield per mu was only about 400 jin. The farm was established in 1951, and the emancipated peasants became farm workers, the vast majority of whom were from poor and lower-middle peasant backgrounds. Over the past ten years, through the party's continuous education, the ideological awareness of the vast number of workers and staff has become higher and higher, forming a strong land reclamation team. In the face of frequent typhoons and floods, they worked hard on farmland capital construction and cultivation techniques, combining the study of modern agricultural technology and advanced experience from other places with local realities, and adopted methods such as building dikes to resist floods, pumping water to drain floods, and opening ditches to drain water and lower the groundwater level, turning water disasters into water conservancy, improving soil, implementing crop rotation between water and drought, combining land use and land maintenance, continuously experimenting with the selection and breeding of fine rice varieties, and gradually exploring a set of technical measures for cultivating double-cropping rice, with yields increasing year after year. The early rice fine variety "Zhujiang Dwarf," which they cultivated, with the advantages of early maturity, high yield, wind resistance, and lodging resistance, has been promoted and planted in many regions across the country.

　　Nantong Farm is mainly engaged in cotton planting. Under the slogan of "farming for the revolution," they firmly grasp production technical measures, and in recent years the yield of ginned cotton per mu has remained above 100 jin. In 1965, because they grasped grain production while grasping cotton production, they finally won a bumper harvest of both grain and cotton. In addition to being self-sufficient in grain, they also turned over 500,000 jin to the state; the yield of ginned cotton per mu also increased to 135 jin, making it a high-yield flag for cotton production among state-owned farms.

　　This farm was established in 1958 through land reclamation on the shoals of the Yangtze River. Over the past few years, the farm leaders have always paid attention to strengthening the political and ideological work of workers and staff, and vigorously grasping the study of Chairman Mao’s writings. Through study, the vast number of workers and staff have further understood the principle of for whom to make revolution and for whom to labor, and their enthusiasm for production has become even greater; the cadres have also continuously improved their work style and work methods. In terms of production measures, they pay attention to strengthening farmland capital construction. In this way, the farm has been run better and better, cotton production has continued to be stable and high-yield, and grain production has also developed.

　　Dongtai Farm is a tropical crop plantation. Since its establishment in 1950, the vast number of workers and staff of this farm have continuously explored the planting and growth laws of tropical crops with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and striving for strength, and with the great ambition of pioneering the tropical crop cause for the motherland, so that tropical crops can be planted quickly and grow well. Over the past few years, they have provided a large amount of rich experience for China's tropical crop production, becoming an advanced flag for tropical crop production.

　　The spirit of hard struggle and diligence in running the farm of this farm is also very prominent. The workers and staff's slogan is: "Use every penny on the blade of the knife." Among China's tropical crop farms, this is the farm with the lowest production cost, the most profits turned over to the state, and the fastest recovery of state investment.

    农垦部表扬五个突出政治的标兵农场
    号召各农场以它们为榜样创造新成就
    据新华社讯　不久前，农垦部表扬了五个国营农场，指出它们是全国农场的标兵，号召各地农场以它们为榜样，进一步开展比学赶帮超运动，在第三个五年计划的第一年中创造出新的成就。
    受到表扬的这五个农场是：江西荷塘垦殖场，新疆生产建设兵团四师十二团农场，广东珠江农场，江苏南通农场和广东东泰农场。这些农场的共同特点是：善于在工作中突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想统帅一切工作；勇于突破洋框框和旧框框，从我国的具体情况出发，在农场建设中坚定地走自己的道路。由于突出了政治，不断地用毛泽东思想武装职工群众，把革命精神与科学态度结合起来，这五个农场在生产、建设和经营管理等方面，都做出了显著的成绩。
    荷塘垦殖场是国营农场中高度发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，勤俭建设社会主义新山区的一面红旗。这个垦殖场建立八年来，团结山区人民，向自然界英勇进军，革秃山、薄田、产量低的命，把昔日一片荒凉的穷山沟，建设成为富饶的社会主义新山区。一九六五年，全场粮食亩产量已达到八百零一斤。比一九五七年建场时增加一倍多。到一九六五年为止的八年间，全场上调给国家一百七十多万斤商品粮；为国家积累了一百一十八万元资金，投资回收率达到百分之二百五十。
    这个垦殖场是由几百名机关干部上山办起来的。他们克服了建场初期生活上与生产上遇到的种种困难，以顽强的革命意志与求实的科学态度，征服了一个又一个的山头。八年来，他们正确处理与解决了“治田必须治山，以林促粮；治山必须治田，以粮养林；治田还必须治水，以水保粮；治水又必须治山，以山保水”山水田的辩证关系，把三千多亩分布在三百八十多个垄坂的、只能种一季的低产农田，建设成为一年种两季的旱涝保收稳产高产农田，使生产逐年发展，连年获得增产。同时，他们还开展了山区的多种经营，扩大了生产门路；不断改进企业经营管理，从多方面注意勤俭节约，做到了收入多，开支少，年年盈利。他们还从政治和技术等方面，大力帮助和支援周围人民公社，被人们誉为“农垦战线的大寨”。
    新疆生产建设兵团四师十二团农场是一个以农业为主，农牧结合，多种经营全面发展的机械化国营农场，是西北地区国营农场稳产高产的一面红旗。这个农场主要是由转业官兵组成，他们保持和发扬了人民解放军的光荣革命传统，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神与科学态度，经过十四年的艰苦奋斗，用开沟排水，用水压盐，降低地下水位和增施肥料等办法，把巩乃斯河畔的一片达十万亩以上的盐碱荒地，改造成肥沃的良田，使粮食平均亩产水平在一九六一年就提前超过了“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。
    这个农场在一切工作中，把政治放在首位，以政治统帅业务，大力开展活学活用毛主席著作的活动，狠抓活思想，从而不断提高职工的阶级觉悟与革命热情，各项工作就出现了生动活泼的局面。这里地处少数民族地区，职工们很注意加强同少数民族的团结，协助他们发展生产，真正发挥了“生产队、工作队、战斗队”的作用。
    珠江农场是以不断革命的精神，顽强地钻研科学技术，革新栽培技术，连年获得水稻大幅度增产著名的。一九六三年，全场水稻亩产就达千斤以上，成为国营农场水稻高产旗帜。
    这个农场位于珠江口冲积而成的万顷沙地区，解放前那里人穷地瘦，水稻亩产只四百来斤。一九五一年建场，翻身农民成了农场工人，其中绝大多数是贫下中农出身。十几年来，经过党的不断教育，广大职工思想觉悟越来越高，形成了一支坚强的农垦队伍。他们在台风多、水涝多的情况下，在农田基本建设与耕作技术上下苦功夫，把学习农业现代技术和外地先进经验同当地实际联系起来，采取修堤抗洪、抽水排涝、开沟排水降低地下水位等办法，变水患为水利，改良土壤，实行水旱轮作，用地和养地相结合，不断试验选育水稻良种，逐渐摸索出一套栽培双季稻的技术措施，产量连年增长。他们培育出的具有早熟、高产、抗风、不倒伏等优点的早稻良种“珠江矮”，已在全国很多地区推广种植。
    南通农场以种植棉花为主，他们在“为革命种田”的口号下，狠抓生产技术措施，近几年来亩产皮棉一直保持在百斤以上。一九六五年由于他们在抓好棉花生产的同时，大力抓紧粮食生产，终于夺得了粮棉双丰收，粮食除自给外，还上交给国家五十万斤；皮棉亩产量又提高到一百三十五斤，是国营农场中棉花高产的旗帜。
    这个农场是一九五八年在长江滩地围垦建立起来的。几年来，农场领导经常注意加强职工的政治思想工作，大抓毛主席著作学习。通过学习，广大职工进一步懂得了为谁革命、为谁劳动的道理，生产劲头更足更大；干部也不断改进工作作风和工作方法。在生产措施上，他们注意加强农田基本建设。这样，就促使农场越办越好，棉花持续稳产高产，粮食生产也有发展。
    东泰农场是一个热带作物种植场。从一九五○年建场以来，这个场的广大职工以自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，怀着为祖国热带作物事业开山辟路的伟大抱负，不断探索热带作物的种植和生长规律，使热带作物种得快，长得好。几年来，已为我国热带作物生产提供了大量丰富的经验，成为热带作物生产的先进旗帜。
    这个农场艰苦奋斗、勤俭办场的精神也很突出，职工们的口号是：“把每一分钱都用在刀刃上”。在我国热带作物农场中，这是生产成本最低、上交利润最多、国家投资回收最快的一个农场。
