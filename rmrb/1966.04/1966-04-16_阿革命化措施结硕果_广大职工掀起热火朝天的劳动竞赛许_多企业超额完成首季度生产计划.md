    Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 12th. Encouraged by the appeal of the Albanian Labor Party and the government, as well as the open letter from the Party Central Committee, workers in many industrial and mining enterprises in Albania have launched an enthusiastic labor emulation campaign, completing or exceeding their production plans for the first quarter of this year.
    The capital, Tirana, completed 102.3 percent of its industrial production plan for the first quarter. Several large industrial enterprises in the capital, such as the Stalin Textile United Factory, the Enver Hoxha Machine Plant, the Ali Kelmendi Food United Factory, and the "November 21st" Construction Company, have all exceeded their first quarter production plans. The Enver Hoxha Machine Plant's output in the first three months of this year increased by 5 percent compared to the same period last year, and it has added hundreds of new products that previously relied on imports.
    The vast majority of factories and enterprises in Durrës, Berat, Elbasan, and other places have also completed and exceeded their production plans for the first quarter of this year.
    Workers in the Rubik mining area produced 500 tons more minerals than planned. Among them, the famous Rubik "May 1st" Copper Mine overproduced 160 tons of chalcopyrite. Although a number of workers at the Selenica asphalt mine responded to the Party's call to return to the countryside to participate in agricultural production, resulting in a reduced labor force, the workers displayed a high degree of revolutionary enthusiasm, further improved labor organization, and carried out production competitions between various departments and production teams, successfully completing their first quarter production tasks. Workers at the Pishkash nickel-iron mine also mined 132 tons more nickel-iron ore than planned in the first three months of this year. Currently, the mine's workers are advancing victoriously, striving to overproduce 1,000 tons of nickel-iron ore this year.
    In the first three months of this year, many handicraft cooperatives and consumer cooperatives further improved the supply system oriented towards the countryside, expanded the rural commercial network, and completed or exceeded their supply plans for the first quarter.

    阿革命化措施结硕果
    广大职工掀起热火朝天的劳动竞赛许
    多企业超额完成首季度生产计划
    新华社地拉那十二日电　在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和政府的呼吁书以及党中央公开信的鼓舞下，阿尔巴尼亚许多工矿企业的职工，掀起热火朝天的劳动竞赛，完成或超额完成了今年第一季度的生产计划。
    首都地拉那第一季度的工业生产计划完成了百分之一百零二点三。首都几个大型工业企业如斯大林纺织联合工厂、恩维尔·霍查机器厂、阿里·卡尔门迪食品联合工厂以及“十一月二十一日”建筑公司等单位都超额完成了第一季度的生产计划。恩维尔·霍查机器厂今年前三个月的产量比去年同期增加百分之五，并增加了上百种过去依靠进口的新产品。
    都拉斯、培拉特、爱尔巴桑等地的绝大部分工厂企业也都完成和超额完成了今年第一季度的生产计划。
    卢比克矿区的工人比原定计划多生产了五百吨矿产，其中著名的卢比克“五一”铜矿就超额生产了一百六十吨紫铜矿。塞列尼查沥青矿虽然有不少工人响应党的号召回到农村参加农业生产，劳动力有所减少，但工人们发挥了高度的革命干劲，进一步改善了劳动组织，并在各部门和各生产队之间开展了生产竞赛，胜利地完成了第一季度的生产任务。皮什卡什镍铁矿的工人在今年前三个月中也比原计划多开采了一百三十二吨镍铁矿。目前这个矿的工人正乘胜前进，为在今年超额生产一千吨镍铁矿而努力。
    在今年前三个月中，许多手工业合作社和消费合作社进一步改善面向农村的供货系统，扩大农村商业网，完成或超额完成了第一季度的供货计划。
