    Party Members Should Study Current Events
    In the past, some Party member comrades in our Party branch did not pay attention to current affairs and did not understand the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world very well. Some even said, "It's enough for us to do a good job in production. We don't need to ask about major events in the world." Through studying Chairman Mao's works, everyone realized that they should care about the affairs of the world and should have "their feet planted in the mountains, their hearts set on the whole country, and their eyes on the world." After that, Party member comrades gradually developed the habit of listening to the radio and reading newspapers. For example, Zuo Lianyou, a member of the branch committee, listens to a segment of current affairs broadcasts almost every night. When he heard that the American robbers were increasing their troops in South Vietnam and expanding their aggression in Vietnam, committing all kinds of evil, he said angrily, "We must exert ourselves and produce more grain to support the Vietnamese brothers in fiercely beating these jackals." Afterwards, he led the commune members in making remarkable achievements in accumulating fertilizer. After listening to the current affairs broadcast, Party member Guo Xuewen actively led the youths of the Guantang team to practice martial arts during their rest time, preparing to strike at the aggressors. Wang Chongyi, the deputy secretary of the branch, learned about the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation through reading newspapers, and actively educated his three sons and the youths of the whole team to learn from the revolutionary spirit of the South Vietnamese hero Nguyen Van Troi.
    The Party and Comrade Mao Zedong often teach us to carry forward the spirit of proletarian internationalism and resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Only by constantly studying current affairs can we understand the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, cultivate our own ideological feelings of sharing weal and woe with the people of all countries in the world, and truly have the world in our hearts. Therefore, I suggest that Party member comrades in various places always pay attention to studying current affairs and develop this habit.

### 党员要学习时事

    党员要学习时事
    我们党支部以前有一部分党员同志不关心时事，对世界人民的革命斗争不很了解。有的甚至说：“咱们搞好生产就行了，世界上的大事用不着咱问。”通过学习毛主席著作，大家才认识到应该关心天下大事，要“身在山区，胸怀全国，放眼世界”。之后，党员同志逐渐养成了收听广播和读报的习惯。如支部委员左连友同志，几乎每天晚上都听一段时事广播。在听到美国强盗增兵南越，在越南扩大侵略，无恶不作时，他气愤地说：“咱们一定要拿出劲头干，多打粮食，支援越南兄弟狠狠打这些豺狼。”过后，他带领社员在积肥方面做出了显著成绩。党员国学文同志听了时事广播后，积极带领官塘队青年利用休息时间练武，准备打击侵略者。支部副书记王崇义同志通过读报，了解到越南人民的抗美救国斗争情况，积极教育自己的三个儿子和全队青年学习南越英雄阮文追烈士的革命精神。
    党和毛泽东同志经常教导我们要发扬无产阶级国际主义精神，坚决支持世界人民的革命斗争。我们只有经常学习时事，才能了解各国人民的革命斗争情况，才能培养自己同世界各国人民同呼吸共命运的思想感情，才能真正胸怀世界。因此，我建议各地党员同志经常注意学习时事，并养成习惯。
