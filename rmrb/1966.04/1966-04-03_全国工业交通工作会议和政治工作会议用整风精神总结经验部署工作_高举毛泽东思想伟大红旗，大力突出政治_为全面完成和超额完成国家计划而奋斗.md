    Xinhua News Agency, April 2nd. The National Industrial and Transportation Work Conference and the National Industrial and Transportation Political Work Conference were recently held in Beijing.

    This conference was convened under the new situation where China's industrial and transportation front has achieved major victories for two consecutive years and has begun to implement the Third Five-Year Plan of great strategic significance. This is a conference that highlights politics, a conference to systematically re-study Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions on running industry and enterprises, and a conference to summarize experience and deploy work using Mao Zedong Thought.

    During the conference, Party and state leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Deng Xiaoping received all the comrades attending the conference, giving everyone great encouragement. Comrades Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping made important reports at the meeting, respectively, which greatly improved everyone's understanding of how to analyze the situation, summarize experience, and run industry and enterprises in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

    The conference consistently implemented the spirit of rectification, fully promoted democracy, engaged in extensive airing of views, debates, and criticisms, and self-criticisms, and used the method of combining the general with the specific and dividing one into two to examine work and summarize experience.

    During the conference, a number of advanced typical reports were organized, and seventy Daqing-style advanced units were recommended. Comrades from Daqing Oilfield, Shanghai, the Second Ministry of Machine Building, Jinzhou, the Southwest Region, Jin Southeast Prefecture, the Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, and the Ministry of Railways successively introduced their experiences at the meeting. Representatives of advanced figures on the national industrial and transportation front, such as Wang Jinxi, Tian Fenglin, Feng Yuping, Chen Xinyu, Huang Rongchang, and Liu Yuanfu, also made typical reports at the meeting. The conference also organized all comrades to visit the Daqing Oilfield Exhibition. All the participants were greatly shaken after listening to the reports and viewing the exhibition, feeling that the situation was pressing. They took Daqing and other advanced units as examples to identify shortcomings, making the discussion of the conference lively, active, and progressively deeper.

    The conference focused on discussing the issue of highlighting politics. In fact, this conference was a major inspection and debate on highlighting politics. Everyone believed that in the past two years, the industrial and transportation front has made great progress in highlighting politics, launched a mass upsurge of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, carried out the socialist education movement, learned from the People's Liberation Army, learned from Daqing, and witnessed a new atmosphere of high spirits among the broad masses. However, there is still a big gap compared with the People's Liberation Army. At present, the general situation is that the two ends are small and the middle is large. In most units, on the one hand, political work has been strengthened, and on the other hand, there are still many problems in the understanding and methods of highlighting politics. Some cadres consciously or unconsciously put politics and professional work on an equal footing. In their work, they are steady and comprehensive, failing to grasp the center, the main contradiction, and the main aspect of the contradiction. This is an eclectic point of view. Some people even reverse the relationship between politics and professional work, ignoring politics and focusing only on things. This is a purely professional point of view. Both of these views do not recognize that politics is the commander and the soul, and they are both metaphysical in their thinking methods. After discussion, everyone deeply realized that without thoroughly refuting these two erroneous views from both practical and theoretical perspectives, it would be impossible to truly highlight politics.

    Through reviewing and summarizing the eight years of history, the conference affirmed the great achievements, pointed out the shortcomings, drew a clear line between right and wrong, and clarified the positive and negative experiences, enabling everyone to have a unified understanding of the eight years of three years of great development, three years of adjustment, and two years of new production upsurge. Everyone further realized that to run socialist enterprises well, it is necessary to take Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, highlight politics, and follow our own path, and never mechanically copy foreign things. It was further realized that the content of running enterprises in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought mainly includes: taking class struggle and the struggle between the two roads as the key link, adhering to the socialist road, moving towards communism, avoiding revisionism, and preventing capitalist restoration; establishing a revolutionary leadership core, improving the Party committee system, and forever ensuring the absolute leadership of the proletarian vanguard—the Communist Party; thoroughly following the mass line; conscientiously implementing democratic centralism; and continuously revolutionizing and advancing in class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experiments. In short, running enterprises in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought means resolutely implementing the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism.

    The conference made a profound analysis of the current situation on the industrial and transportation front. Everyone believed that the current situation is very good. In 1964 and 1965, China's industrial and transportation front achieved major victories for two consecutive years. Especially in 1965, the broad masses were in high spirits, and the production upsurge steadily rose, basically achieving great energy, steady steps, and rapid development. In this year, not only was the development speed of industrial production very high, but more importantly, the improvement of product quality, the increase in product varieties and technological innovation and technological revolution achievements, the reduction of material consumption, the growth of labor productivity, and the increase in industrial income were all unprecedented since the founding of New China. However, it must also be seen that our work is still very unbalanced, and only a part of the cadres and units are truly consciously running enterprises in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought; enterprise management has not yet summarized a complete set of experiences; production potential has not been tapped enough; and there are still weak links in the industry. All this shows that the tasks before us are very arduous. It will take decades of hard work to realize the modernization of industry, agriculture, national defense, science, and technology in our country.

    After full discussion, the conference determined the general requirements for industrial and transportation work in 1966 based on the construction goals of the Third Five-Year Plan: hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vigorously highlight politics, ensure national key construction, support national defense, support agriculture, promote a new upsurge in industrial production, and strive to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the national plan. The specific policies are as follows:

    First, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take the People's Liberation Army as an example, and vigorously highlight politics.

    Second, widely carry out the movement of learning from Daqing, creating five-good units, comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping each other, and surpassing each other, to realize the revolutionization of enterprises.

    Third, achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results, put quality first, strive to increase production, resolutely oppose waste, and promote a new upsurge in industrial production.

    Fourth, further carry out mass technological innovation and technological revolution, and highlight the word "surpass" in catching up with and surpassing advanced domestic and foreign technological levels.

    Fifth, vigorously support agriculture and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance.

    Sixth, actively support national defense and ensure national key construction.

    The center贯穿[sic] throughout the above six policies is highlighting politics. To highlight politics, we must take Chairman Mao's works as the supreme instruction for all our work, and put the creative study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the first place of all work. In the first half of this year, the leadership organs and enterprises at all levels of the industrial and transportation front must carry out a major inspection and debate on how to highlight politics in the form of rectification.

    In order to ensure the realization of the industrial and transportation work policy in 1966, the conference also determined the key points of industrial and transportation political work in 1966. That is, to push the movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new upsurge; to carry out the socialist education movement better batch by batch; to vigorously carry out the movement of learning from Daqing, creating five-good units, comparing with, learning from, catching up with, helping each other, and surpassing each other; to adhere to the four firsts, and vigorously grasp living ideas; to actively cultivate and promote new forces, and strengthen the construction of grassroots Party organizations; to conscientiously implement democratic centralism; to adhere to cadres participating in physical labor; and to strengthen the construction of political organs.

    The conference required the Party committees of various departments and enterprises of industry and transportation to firmly grasp the revolutionization of leadership and thoroughly understand both ends. On the one hand, they must earnestly study and closely follow Chairman Mao's instructions and the central government's guidelines and policies. On the other hand, they must vigorously promote the style of investigation and research, go deep into the grassroots, go deep among the masses, conscientiously stay at selected points, participate in labor, understand the situation, and grasp living ideas. At the same time, it also required all cadres on the industrial and transportation front, especially leading cadres at all levels, to be sober promoters in the face of a good situation. The better the situation and the more successful the work, the more they must be modest and prudent, and prevent arrogance and complacency. As long as we hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, truly highlight politics, and unite all workers and masses, we will surely be able to overcome any difficulties and achieve greater victories.

    The conference was presided over by Comrades Bo Yibo and Tao Lujia. Comrade Tao Lujia made a report at the beginning of the conference. Comrade Bo Yibo made a summary at the end of the conference. The participants included the secretaries in charge of industrial and transportation work of the various central bureaus and provincial, municipal, and autonomous region Party committees, the ministers and political department directors of the central industrial and transportation ministries, the directors of the economic commissions and the directors of the industrial and transportation political departments of the various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as the responsible comrades in charge of industrial and transportation work in thirty-six municipalities under the jurisdiction of the provinces. Responsible comrades of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and the trade unions of various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also participated in the conference.

    The conference began on January 27 and ended on March 5.

    全国工业交通工作会议和政治工作会议用整风精神总结经验部署工作
    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出政治  为全面完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗
    新华社二日讯　全国工业交通工作会议和全国工业交通政治工作会议最近在北京举行。
    这次会议，是在我国工业交通战线连续两年取得重大胜利，开始执行具有伟大战略意义的第三个五年计划的新形势下召开的。这是一次突出政治的会议，是一次重新系统学习毛主席和党中央关于办工业、办企业的指示的会议，是一次用毛泽东思想总结经验、部署工作的会议。
    会议期间，刘少奇、周恩来、邓小平等党和国家领导人接见了参加会议的全体同志，给大家以极大的鼓舞。周恩来同志、邓小平同志分别在会上作了重要报告，使大家对如何分析形势、总结经验，如何按照毛泽东思想办工业、办企业，在认识上有了很大提高。
    会议自始至终贯彻了整风的精神，充分发扬民主，大鸣大放，开展批评和自我批评，并且用以虚带实、一分为二的方法，检查工作，总结经验。
    会议过程中，组织了一批先进典型报告，还推荐出七十个大庆式先进单位。大庆油田、上海市、第二机械工业部、锦州市、西南地区、晋东南专区、石油部、化工部、冶金部、铁道部的同志先后在会上介绍了经验；全国工业交通战线上先进人物代表王进喜、田凤林、冯玉萍、陈鑫煜、黄荣昌、刘源富等同志也先后在会上作了典型报告。会议还组织全体同志参观了大庆油田展览会。所有与会同志听了报告、看了展览，震动很大，感到形势逼人，纷纷以大庆和其他先进单位为样板，大找差距，使会议的讨论，生动活泼，步步深入。
    会议着重讨论了突出政治的问题。实际上这次会议就是一次对突出政治的大检查、大辩论。大家认为，近两年来，工业交通战线突出政治有了很大的进步，掀起了群众性的活学活用毛主席著作的热潮，开展了社会主义教育运动，大学解放军、大学大庆，出现了广大群众精神振奋的新气象。但是，同解放军相比，还有很大差距。现在，总的情况是两头小、中间大。大多数单位，一方面是政治工作有所加强，另一方面对突出政治在认识上和方法上仍然存在不少问题。有一部分干部，他们自觉或者不自觉地把政治和业务平列起来，在工作中四平八稳，面面俱到，抓不住中心，抓不住主要矛盾和矛盾的主要方面。这是折衷主义观点。有的人甚至把政治和业务颠倒过来，在工作中不问政治，见物不见人。这是单纯业务观点。这两种观点，都不承认政治是统帅、是灵魂，在思想方法上都是形而上学的。经过讨论，大家深刻地认识到，不从实践和理论两方面彻底驳倒这两种错误观点，就不可能真正做到突出政治。
    会议通过对八年历史的回顾和总结，肯定了伟大成绩，指出了缺点，划清了正确与错误的界线，明确了正面与反面的经验，使大家对三年大发展、三年调整、两年新的生产高潮的八年历史，有了统一的认识。大家进一步认识到，办好社会主义企业，必须以毛泽东思想为指针，突出政治，走我们自己的道路，而决不能照抄照搬外国的东西。进一步认识到，按照毛泽东思想办企业的内容，主要是：以阶级斗争和两条道路斗争为纲，坚持社会主义道路，走向共产主义，避免修正主义，防止资本主义复辟；建立革命化的领导核心，健全党委制，永远保证无产阶级先锋队——共产党的绝对领导；彻底走群众路线；认真实行民主集中制；无论阶级斗争、生产斗争、科学实验都要不断革命、不断前进。总之，按照毛泽东思想办企业就是要坚决贯彻执行鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线。
    会议对当前工业交通战线的形势作了深刻的分析。大家认为，当前形势很好。一九六四年和一九六五年，我国工业交通战线连续两年取得了重大胜利。特别是一九六五年，广大群众精神振奋，生产高潮稳步上升，基本上做到了干劲大、步子稳、发展快。这一年，不仅工业生产的发展速度很高，更重要的是，产品质量的提高，产品品种和技术革新、技术革命成果的增多，物资消耗的降低，劳动生产率的增长，工业收入的增加，其幅度之大，都是新中国成立以来没有过的。但是，还必须看到，我们的工作还很不平衡，真正自觉地按照毛泽东思想办企业的干部和单位还只是一部分；企业管理还没有总结出一套完整的经验；生产潜力还挖掘得很不够；工业内部还有薄弱环节。所有这些说明，摆在我们面前的任务是十分艰巨的。要在我国实现工业、农业、国防、科学技术的现代化，还需要几十年的艰苦努力。
    会议经过充分讨论，根据第三个五年计划的建设目标，确定了一九六六年工业交通工作总的要求：高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，大力突出政治，保证国家重点建设，支援国防，支援农业，促进工业生产新高潮，为全面完成和超额完成国家计划而奋斗，具体方针有以下六项：
    第一，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以解放军为榜样，大力突出政治。
    第二，广泛开展学大庆、创五好的比学赶帮超运动，实现企业革命化。
    第三，多快好省，好字当头，努力增产，狠反浪费，促进工业生产新高潮。
    第四，进一步开展群众性的技术革新、技术革命，在赶超国内外先进技术水平中突出“超”字。
    第五，大力支援农业，巩固工农联盟。
    第六，积极支援国防，保证国家重点建设。
    贯串上述六项方针的中心是突出政治。突出政治，必须把毛主席著作作为我们各项工作的最高指示，把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。在今年上半年内，工业交通战线的各级领导机关和各企业，都要用整风的方式，开展一次关于如何突出政治的大检查大辩论。
    为了保证一九六六年工业交通工作方针的实现，会议还确定了一九六六年工业交通政治工作的要点。这就是，要把学习毛主席著作的运动推向一个新的高潮；要把社会主义教育运动一批比一批搞得更好；大力开展学大庆、创五好的比学赶帮超运动；坚持四个第一，大抓狠抓活思想；积极培养提拔新生力量，加强基层党组织的建设；认真贯彻实行民主集中制；坚持干部参加体力劳动；加强政治机关的建设。
    会议要求工业交通各部门、各企业党委狠抓领导革命化，吃透两头。一头，必须认真学习、紧紧跟上毛主席的指示和中央的方针政策。另一头，必须大兴调查研究之风，深入基层，深入群众，认真蹲点，参加劳动，了解情况，抓活思想。同时，还要求工业交通战线上的全体干部，特别是各级领导干部，在大好形势面前，要当冷静的促进派。形势越好，工作越有成绩，越要谦虚谨慎，防止骄傲自满。只要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，真正做到突出政治，团结全体职工群众，就一定能够战胜任何困难，取得更大胜利。
    会议由薄一波、陶鲁笳同志主持。陶鲁笳同志在会议开始时作了报告。薄一波同志在会议结束时作了总结。参加会议的，有各中央局和省、市、自治区党委主管工业交通工作的书记，中央工业交通各部的部长、政治部主任，各省、市、自治区的经委主任和工交政治部主任，以及三十六个省辖市主管工业交通工作的负责同志。全国总工会和各省、市、自治区工会的负责同志也参加了这个会议。
    会议于一月二十七日开始，三月五日结束。
