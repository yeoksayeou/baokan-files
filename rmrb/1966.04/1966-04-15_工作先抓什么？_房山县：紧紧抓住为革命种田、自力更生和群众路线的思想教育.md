    What should be grasped first in work?
    Fangshan County: Firmly grasping the ideological education of farming for the revolution, self-reliance, and the mass line.
    (Our newspaper dispatch) The Fangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Beijing has been emphasizing politics in spring plowing, which has improved the peasants' awareness of farming for the revolution. The preparatory work of many communes and production teams has been done better than in previous years.
    In previous years, the county committee would hold spring plowing production meetings in January and February to arrange production tasks and urge plowing and sowing. This year, at the spring plowing production meeting held in late February, county and commune leading cadres were first organized to study and compare themselves with the revolutionary deeds of Comrade Jiao Yulu, examine themselves, talk about their thoughts, present contradictions, and find shortcomings. This gave everyone great inspiration: To lead this year's spring plowing production well, the key is the revolutionary ideological transformation of the county and commune leading cadres. If they only bury their heads in grasping production, without asking about ideology or talking about politics, they cannot improve the awareness of the vast numbers of cadres and masses in farming for the revolution, and cannot do spring plowing work in a timely and solid manner. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize politics and promote production through politics. After the meeting unified ideological understanding, because the direction was clear and the thinking was correct, some specific work in the current production was arranged more smoothly.
    After the meeting, led by county and commune leading cadres, a large number of cadres went deep into the front line of production to grasp political work. At that time, wheat field management, sending manure and fertilizer, leveling land, plowing and sowing, building water conservancy projects, and planting trees and afforestation were almost all being carried out at the same time. Some people began to waver about emphasizing politics. Some cadres said, "It is easy to emphasize politics at ordinary times, but it is not easy to emphasize politics during the busy farming season." "Grasping politics during the busy farming season is slow to take effect; grasping work points and rewards is faster." The Fangshan County Committee seized these living thoughts and held political work meetings in a timely manner to improve the cadres' understanding of emphasizing politics. Some cadres used facts to illustrate that if politics is not emphasized during the busy farming season and the enthusiasm of the members is mobilized simply by increasing work points and rewards, although production may increase temporarily, it will be unstable and will lead people astray. Huinan Village Brigade of Nanshangluo Commune, due to its good water conservancy work, has seen a large increase in production and living standards in recent years. However, due to the relaxation of political work, many members were content with the status quo and afraid of hardship. During the busy farming season, the production team would use the method of increasing work points to encourage members to work, resulting in some people becoming increasingly indifferent to the collective and only caring about their personal interests. This year, when preparing for plowing, digging wells, and digging ditches, some young people complained about the cold weather and the hard work, and were unwilling to do it. What should be done? Guo Xinting, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Committee who was stationed in this brigade, suggested that the brigade Party branch organize cadres and members to study Chairman Mao's articles such as "Serve the People" again. After studying, the members realized that they should not forget the revolution even if their lives are better. Engaging in production is not only for individuals to have enough to eat and wear, but also for the revolutionary cause of the whole country and the whole world. Some young people who were originally unwilling to dig wells and ditches asked to take on heavy burdens. Members who were not often present for work also took the lead in going down wells and digging wells.
    In leading spring plowing production, many county and commune leading cadres started by grasping living thoughts to solve problems in their work. When Zhao Ge Zhuang Commune was implementing the planting plan for early-maturing crops, many production teams, despite having relatively good water conservancy conditions, were unwilling to plant more early-maturing crops. Liu Tingyang, the secretary of the commune Party committee, heard some members say while squatting and working, "There is enough to eat now, why expand the two crops, and not suffer that fatigue." He believed that this kind of thinking was very representative, so he organized cadres and members of the entire commune to discuss the issue of "farming for the revolution or just farming to feed themselves." As a result of the discussion, cadres and members of the masses realized the relationship between farming and socialist revolution and socialist construction, and the relationship between farming and supporting the world revolution. Everyone's revolutionary enthusiasm was improved, they actively tapped fertilizer sources, increased fertilizer application, and expanded the planting of early-maturing crops. As a result, the area of early-maturing crops planted by the entire commune increased from the original plan of 2,000 mu to 6,000 mu.
    After timely checking and summarizing the experience of emphasizing politics in the previous stage of spring plowing production, the Fangshan County Committee believed that it must firmly grasp the three issues of farming for the revolution or just farming for oneself; relying on the spirit of self-reliance to farm or relying on the state to farm; following the mass line or cadres having the final say, and educate cadres and members, so that emphasizing politics gradually takes root in everyone's minds, truly grasp politics, promote production, and strive for a good harvest in agricultural production this year.

    工作先抓什么？
    房山县：紧紧抓住为革命种田、自力更生和群众路线的思想教育
    本报讯　中共北京市房山县委突出政治抓春耕，提高了农民为革命种田的自觉性，许多社、队的备耕工作比往年做得更好。
    往年，每到一、二月份，县委都要召开春耕生产会议，布置生产任务，催耕催种。今年二月下旬召开的春耕生产会议，首先组织县、社领导干部学习和对照焦裕禄同志的革命事迹，检查自己，谈思想，摆矛盾，找差距，展开批评与自我批评，使大家受到很大的启发：要领导好今年春耕生产，关键是县、社领导干部的思想要革命化，如果只是埋头抓生产，不问思想，不谈政治，就不能提高广大干部和群众为革命种田的自觉性，把春耕工作搞得又及时又扎实。因此，必须突出政治，抓政治促生产。会议在统一思想认识后，由于方向明，思路对，就较为顺利地安排了当前生产中的一些具体工作。
    会后，在县、社领导干部带动下，大批干部深入生产第一线，抓政治工作。当时，麦田管理、送粪运肥、平整土地、犁地播种、兴修水利、植树造林等项工作，几乎都要同时进行，有些人对突出政治动摇起来。有些干部说：“平时突出政治容易，农忙时突出政治不好办。”“农忙时抓政治见效慢，抓工分、奖励见效快。”房山县委抓住这些活思想，及时召开了政治工作会议，提高干部对突出政治的认识。有些干部用事实说明，在农忙时不突出政治，单纯靠增加工分和奖励去调动社员积极性，生产虽然一时可能上得去，但是既不稳定，又会把人带到邪路上去。南尚洛公社惠南庄大队由于水利搞得好，几年来生产水平和生活水平都有了较大的提高，但是，由于放松政治工作，不少社员安于现状，害怕艰苦。农忙时，生产队就用增加工分的办法鼓励社员出勤，结果有些人越来越不关心集体，只顾个人利益。今年备耕打井、挖渠时，有些青年人就嫌天冷，活累，不愿干。怎么办呢？在这个大队蹲点的县委常委郭馨亭，建议大队党支部组织干部和社员再学习毛主席的《为人民服务》等文章。经过学习，社员们认识到：生活好了也不能忘记革命。搞生产不光是为了个人吃饱穿好，而是为了全国和全世界的革命事业。原来一些不愿去打井、挖渠的青年人，纷纷要求挑重担。原来不经常出勤的社员，也带头下井、挖井。
    在领导春耕生产中，不少县、社领导干部从抓活思想入手，解决工作中的问题。赵各庄公社在落实早熟作物播种计划的时候，很多生产队尽管有比较好的水利条件，却不愿多种早熟作物。公社党委书记刘廷洋在蹲点劳动时，听到有的社员说：“现在够吃了，还扩大两茬干什么，不受那份累了。”他认为这种思想很有代表性，就组织全公社的干部和社员讨论“为革命种田，还是只为自己吃饱肚子种田”的问题。讨论结果，干部和社员群众认识到了种田和社会主义革命、社会主义建设的关系，种田和支持世界革命的关系。大家的革命干劲提高了，积极挖掘肥源，增施肥料，扩种早熟作物。结果，全公社播种的早熟作物由原计划的两千亩增加到六千亩。
    房山县委在及时检查和总结了前一阶段春耕生产中突出政治的经验后，认为必须紧紧抓住为革命种田，还是只为自己种田；依靠自力更生精神种田，还是依赖国家种田；走群众路线，还是干部说了算等三个问题，对干部、社员进行教育，使突出政治逐步在大家思想上扎下根，真正抓好政治，促进生产，争取今年农业生产的好收成。
