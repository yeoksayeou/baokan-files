    Marking Socialism's Newness and Establishing the Distinction of the Proletariat
    -- The Birth of the Large-Scale Revolutionary Modern Ballet "The White-Haired Girl"
    Yu Luyuan
    Editor's Note: The large-scale revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl," adapted by the Shanghai Dance School from the opera of the same name, will soon be performed in the capital. This article explains that this ballet is another significant achievement in the ballet revolution following "The Red Detachment of Women." Its birth once again proves that foreign classical art forms such as ballet and symphonic music can be transformed according to the principles of "making foreign things serve China" and "making the past serve the present" to serve our socialist cause.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "In literature and art, uncritical borrowing and imitation of ancient people and foreigners is the most unpromising and harmful literary dogmatism and artistic dogmatism." The teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, dare to innovate—"marking" the "newness" of socialism and "establishing" the "distinction" of the proletariat, breaking old frameworks and foreign dogmas, and broadening the path for the further revolutionization, nationalization, and massification of ballet art.
    The large-scale revolutionary ballet "The White-Haired Girl," re-created by the Shanghai Dance School based on the opera of the same name, is another achievement in the ballet revolution following "The Red Detachment of Women." With its profound revolutionary content, strong spirit of the times, and a new artistic style that is welcomed by the masses, it has won warm praise from the workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    A dance school established only six years ago, under the conditions of having no experience, no professional creators and choreographers, holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, marking the newness of socialism, and establishing the distinction of the proletariat, dared to revolutionize classical ballet art, which some consider to be the "supreme art form" and the "peak of art." In a short period of more than a year, it created a revolutionary ballet with a high ideological and artistic level, accumulating new experiences for the further revolutionization, nationalization, and massification of ballet. This is a victory for highlighting politics, a victory for Mao Zedong Thought; it is the gratifying result of the Shanghai Dance School's resolute implementation of the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and the implementation of ideological revolution and artistic revolution.

      Highlight Politics, Vigorously Promote Ballet Revolution

    How did the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School begin the ballet revolution? They started by studying Chairman Mao's works and implementing the ideological revolutionization of people.
    In the past, in the music and dance circles, there have been many debates about the nationalization and massification of ballet. However, some comrades, after much debate, mostly remained on the issue of form and did not understand that to achieve nationalization and massification, it is first necessary to revolutionize. Two years ago, teachers and students at the dance school also had various doubts about whether ballet could reflect revolutionary modern life. Among them, there were two views: one was the "harmlessness theory," and the other was the "remoteness theory." The so-called "harmlessness theory" was that ballet is "just one flower among a hundred flowers, and there is nothing wrong with performing some harmless works at evening parties?" The so-called "remoteness theory" was that the revolutionization, nationalization, and massification of ballet art could only be a matter for the "distant future." As for "supreme classics" like "Swan Lake," "it is already very difficult to learn it, let alone create something yourself?" These two views boiled down to one sentence: ballet art does not need revolution, and it is difficult to revolutionize.
    From the end of 1963 to the beginning of 1964, the East China Regional Modern Drama Performance was held in Shanghai, from which they received great inspiration. Especially after the National Beijing Opera Modern Drama Performance was held in Beijing, producing good examples such as "The Red Lantern" and "Shajiabang," an unprecedented upsurge of performing revolutionary modern dramas was formed throughout the country, which powerfully promoted the ideological revolutionization of the teachers and students of the dance school. During the Spring Festival of 1964, the teachers and students of the dance school went to the countryside and the army to perform, personally feeling the enthusiastic welcome and support of the workers, peasants, and soldiers for revolutionary modern dramas, and seeing the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of amateur literary and art workers in performing revolutionary modern dramas. They could no longer remain calm. A very sharp question could not but arise in their minds: Whom does ballet art serve? Does it serve the vast majority of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the socialist economic base, and proletarian politics, or does it serve the landlords, the bourgeoisie, and their remnants and descendants? The Party branch of the dance school promptly organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" with questions in mind. Chairman Mao said very clearly: "The question of 'for whom?' is a fundamental question, a question of principle." Revolutionary literature and art should serve the vast majority of workers, peasants, and soldiers, "become a component part of the whole revolutionary machine, as a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy." They used Mao Zedong Thought to compare their own ideological situation and the current situation of teaching and performance, and felt that the problem was very serious. Mao Zedong Thought brightened everyone's eyes, making them realize that the so-called "harmlessness theory" and "remoteness theory" were completely wrong. Some students said with deep feeling: "Our performance of artistic works that promote bourgeois individualism and humanism means that we have left the workers, peasants, and soldiers out of our minds, and are spiritually undermining the foundations of socialism." Some teachers and students originally thought that serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers meant performing a few more performances of "Swan Lake" for the workers, peasants, and soldiers to watch, but as for what content they were shown and whether they needed it or not, that was their business; if the workers, peasants, and soldiers did not understand it, it was because their level of appreciation was low. At this time, they began to realize that this idea was actually a rejection of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. How can ballet serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers? They finally found the answer in Chairman Mao's works.
    Through the study of Chairman Mao's works, all the teachers and students of the dance school experienced a profound self-ideological struggle, greatly promoting their ideological revolutionization. The teachers and students were determined to follow Chairman Mao's instructions, use the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains to conquer the fortress of classical ballet art, liberate it from the circle of foreign talented men and beautiful women, and truly make it a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and eliminating the enemy.
    The birth of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" proves a truth: Once people are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, they can generate powerful material strength. In the year from 1964 to the spring of 1965, the objective conditions of the Shanghai Dance School did not change. They still had no professional creators and choreographers, still only a few young teachers, and still only dozens of students. However, things that were originally unimaginable became reality. Young teachers who initially did not even know how to write a ballet script finally completed the choreography of a large-scale revolutionary ballet; composers who had never written ballet music wrote music and dances for "The White-Haired Girl" with a strong revolutionary momentum and a distinct national style; young students with an average age of only twenty conquered one difficult movement after another that they had never learned before, and quite excellently completed the creation of the roles. This fully demonstrates that ballet revolution relies mainly on politics, on Mao Zedong Thought, and on people's revolutionary spirit. With politics and Mao Zedong Thought, all positive factors will be mobilized to strive to improve skills.
    To make revolution, it is impossible not to have difficulties. However, as long as we highlight politics and Mao Zedong Thought, difficulties can be overcome, and unfavorable factors can be transformed into favorable factors. This is the dialectic of revolution. For example, insufficient skills are a difficulty, an unfavorable factor, but the actors all have this experience: "Skills are mastered by people. To improve skills, we must first improve people's thinking. The lack of profound proletarian feelings is the biggest obstacle to improving skills. As long as we turn Chairman Mao's words into action and make revolution with class feelings, we can overcome all difficulties." As for the experience of choreographing revolutionary ballets, it can only be created by grasping Mao Zedong Thought and through revolutionary practice; without revolution, you will never gain this experience.

      Highlight Class Struggle, Write Biographies for Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants

    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is adapted from the opera of the same name. To adapt the opera into a ballet, there must be a process of re-understanding and re-creation, and arduous labor must be paid. This is not only because ballet and opera are two different artistic styles, but more importantly, the times have advanced, which puts new and higher demands on the adaptors. When the choreography of the medium-sized "The White-Haired Girl" began, the leadership pointed out that in dealing with the theme of rural class relations during the democratic revolution period such as "The White-Haired Girl," it is necessary to highlight class exploitation, class oppression, class resistance, and class struggle according to the socialist spirit of the times, and write biographies for the poor and lower-middle peasants. This instruction became the guiding ideology of the creators. However, to implement this guiding ideology into concrete creation, there is not only an artistic exploration process, but more importantly, an ideological understanding improvement process. Under the leadership of the Party, the ballet creators studied Chairman Mao's theory on class, class contradictions, and class struggle, and used Chairman Mao's thought to analyze the subject matter and themes, further realizing that the relationship between Yang Bailao, Xi'er, Dachun, and Huang Shiren is a life-and-death relationship between two hostile classes. The experiences of Xi'er, Dachun, and others are a true reflection of the lives and fates of millions of peasant masses in old China. Wherever there is oppression, there is resistance and struggle. Xi'er's resistance and Dachun's joining the army reflect the strong desire of the broad masses of poor peasants to resist oppression and seek liberation; the paths taken by Xi'er and Dachun are also the historical paths taken by the broad masses of Chinese peasants. Starting from this understanding, the creators firmly grasped the red line of class opposition and struggle to structure the plot and handle the relationships between characters, placing the love relationship between Dachun and Xi'er in a very secondary position, and placing the struggle against exploitation and oppression in the paramount and foremost position.
    The ballet creators also further realized from Chairman Mao's works that to correctly express the rural class struggle during the democratic revolution period, it is necessary to highlight armed struggle. For example, the original fifth scene focused on expressing the close relationship between the army and the people through army-civilian get-togethers. Although this treatment created a lively atmosphere, it lacked clear content. Now, it has been changed to the Eighth Route Army entering the village, mobilizing the masses, arming the masses, and carrying out struggles against local bullies. The original eighth scene ended after Huang Shiren was shot and everyone celebrated liberation. Now, an epilogue has been added, allowing Xi'er to join the army and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end.
    Class struggle and armed struggle are inseparable from the leadership of the Party. The ballet choreographers not only embodied the role of the Party through the images of Uncle Zhao and the Eighth Route Army, but also, after Xi'er was rescued and the struggle was won, concentratedly expressed the masses' infinite gratitude and love for the Party and the great leader Chairman Mao in a vivid form. "The sun is Mao Zedong, the sun is the Communist Party," these two lines of lyrics sang the heartfelt voices of the broad masses of peasants. This treatment made the entire ballet a paean to the class resistance and armed revolution of the peasant masses, and a paean to the Party and Chairman Mao, which further deepened and elevated the theme of the play.
    To correctly express class resistance and armed struggle, the key lies in shaping the images of Yang Bailao, Xi'er, Dachun, Uncle Zhao, and others, using them to express the resistance and revolutionary nature of the poor peasants. Starting from the medium-sized "The White-Haired Girl," the ballet choreographers tried to create new treatments for several main poor peasant images:

    Yang Bailao is portrayed as an old poor peasant full of resistance. He fought back when the landlord came to the door to force debt collection and forcibly seize Xi'er, resulting in being beaten to death. The spiritual qualities displayed by such a death are positive and full of struggle.

    The ballet portrayed Xi'er's image very well. In the face of class enemies, she showed a strong character that was unafraid of violence and dared to fight to the end. The ballet focused on using several important links to show the growth and development of Xi'er's character: the death of her father and her own seizure aroused her strong class hatred, and she was determined to avenge this blood feud; suffering abuse in Huang's family strengthened her will to resist even more. She wanted to break out of Huang's family, to live, and to take revenge; the inhuman life in the barren mountains and forests and the struggle with nature deepened the hatred in her heart and made her character even stronger. So when she encountered her mortal enemy in the Grandma Temple, the anger in her chest erupted like a volcano. In this way, the image of a strong and unyielding poor peasant daughter was vividly established.

    The ballet also made new treatments for Uncle Zhao and Dachun: the former became an image of a calm and experienced underground Party member, while the latter grew from a young poor peasant into a strong Eighth Route Army cadre.

    Are the treatments made to these main positive character images appropriate? Are they more realistic and typical, or the opposite? Is it credible that Yang Bailao dared to fight the landlord when he was forced to pay debts, his daughter was seized, and he was beaten? Is Xi'er's character "too high"? Is Xi'er's daring to beat Huang Shiren "too wild"? Would Xi'er have such a strong character? These questions, when summed up, are actually a question of how to understand the class qualities of the poor peasant masses during the democratic revolution period, and what kind of poor peasant model should be established on the socialist artistic stage.
    In order to solve the above problems, the Party branch of the Shanghai Dance School organized all teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's two articles, "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan." Chairman Mao said very clearly that in the Chinese countryside during the democratic revolution period, poor peasants have always been the main revolutionary force, the "vanguard of the revolution," and "they are mortal enemies with the local tyrants and evil gentry, and they attack the local tyrants and evil gentry's camp without hesitation." These instructions gave the most clear answers to the above questions. In order to deepen the understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions, the leaders of the dance school also organized all teachers and students to participate in the socialist education movement in the countryside before and after the creation of the large-scale "The White-Haired Girl," and at the same time read the deeds of Luo Wenxiu, the "White-Haired Girl" from Sichuan, and listen to the opinions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers on the treatment of Yang Bailao and Xi'er. In this way, the ideological understanding of all the creators was greatly improved, and their class feelings were strengthened. They realized that the resistance of Xi'er, Yang Bailao, and other poor peasants was completely real in the environment at that time, representing the essence and the mainstream of things. They should highly establish Xi'er, Dachun, Yang Bailao, and Uncle Zhao as class representatives of the Chinese poor peasants on the stage, and use them to praise the revolutionary spirit of the working people to inspire the hearts of millions of masses and encourage their will to fight.

    With the improvement of ideological understanding, creation was further promoted. They found that the initial treatments of many plots did not write Xi'er's and other images as "too high" or too strong, but rather could not fully express their resistance. For example, letting Xi'er kneel down to beat Huang's mother's legs, and immediately shrinking her hands and running off the stage after she slapped Huang Shiren, these treatments were obviously detrimental to Xi'er's character. The creators learned from the valuable experience of the ballet "The Red Detachment of Women" and the Beijing opera "The Red Lantern" in shaping heroic characters, revised the plots, improved the dances and music, and further strengthened Xi'er's character, making her overwhelm the other party in spirit and momentum in front of the class enemies, so that this image appeared taller.

    Boldly Break Through Old Forms and Create Revolutionary New Forms

    To use the foreign classical art form of ballet to reflect the struggle life of the modern Chinese workers, peasants, and soldiers, to serve China's socialist revolution and construction, and to be understood and accepted by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, it is impossible not to encounter many contradictions and difficulties. One of the most basic contradictions is the contradiction between the old art form and the new revolutionary ideological content.

    How did the creators of the ballet solve this contradiction and thus achieve a better combination of form and content? The basic principle they followed was: to utilize and transform the old art form and create new forms of revolutionary ballet based on revolutionary real life, and based on the needs of ideological content and character.
    Although the classical ballet art form has some techniques and dance vocabulary that provide conditions for our utilization, its forms, specifications, techniques, and even the so-called light and elegant dance postures and performing styles are deeply imprinted with the lifestyles and thoughts and feelings of the foreign bourgeoisie. If these things are used to express the revolutionary modern life of the Chinese working people without any changes, then it will inevitably distort life and uglify the images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Therefore, to utilize it, it is first necessary to transform it; to transform it, it is necessary to dare to break and dare to establish. With breaking and establishing, there is development and creation. The so-called breaking is to break through the original solidified art form of classical ballet, not to be bound by its set of frameworks, procedures, and specifications. Their approach is: to adhere to starting from the needs of expressing life and character, and to use as much as possible the performing forms, vocabulary, and techniques of classical ballet that can be used after appropriate transformation; those that cannot be used will never be used reluctantly in order to retain certain techniques. If suitable vocabulary and expressions cannot be found in ballet, then materials are drawn from China's national folk dances and operas. Neither ballet nor other dance materials are copied as they are, but rather go through a process of selection, transformation, and recombination.

    The ballet creators deeply realized in practice that only the struggle life of the people is the only source of artistic creation. The ballet art works of the past era are flows rather than sources, and can only be used as a reference for the creation of revolutionary ballet. An important experience they accumulated in solving the contradiction between old form and new content is: first thoroughly understand life, then consider form, and then refine dance movements. That is to say: on the basis of fully understanding the life content to be expressed and the ideological feelings of the characters, look for the most appropriate art form. For example, in the Grandma Temple, the White-Haired Girl discovered her mortal enemies Huang Shiren and Mu Renzhi from the flashing of lightning. At this time, her inner feelings were: "Seeing the enemy, the fire is burning, ... I want to tear him into thousands of pieces." In this prescribed situation, how should the White-Haired Girl act? She must chase and beat the enemy at all costs. It was precisely from this understanding that the choreographers created a dance of the White-Haired Girl chasing and beating Huang Shiren, forcefully expressing Xi'er's fiery class hatred and fearless fighting spirit. Although the dance materials for such a dance combination are still taken from ballet, from a fundamental point of view, it is the artisticization and danceization of life movements.

    Some people may ask: Does insisting on starting from revolutionary political content and from life to transform ballet art destroy the characteristics of ballet? If this characteristic refers to the ethereal "beautiful posture," "the performer's innate elegance," etc., then it will definitely be destroyed. Without destroying it, reflecting the struggle life of the workers, peasants, and soldiers and their thoughts and feelings, and forming a new artistic style of revolutionary ballet is simply impossible. If this characteristic refers to the basic form and techniques of ballet, then expressing the new life of the revolution and shaping the heroic images of the workers, peasants, and soldiers can make them undergo a transformation and gain new life, and be enriched and developed. The creation practice of "The White-Haired Girl" shows that due to the rich and colorful revolutionary life content expressed, the advantages of ballet (such as openness, boldness, large movements, strong jumping ability, etc.) and its basic forms (solo dance, duet, group dance) and techniques (including many difficult technical movements) can be fully developed and utilized as long as they are transformed and developed on the basis of life content. At the same time, it is also necessary to use the strengths of national folk dances (including opera, boxing, etc.) to supplement the deficiencies of ballet. The ballet creators absorbed the rich body movements, gestures, and facial expression movements in Chinese opera dance art and integrated them into ballet; they also used some unique expressions, techniques, and movements in Chinese opera dance, such as poses, sleeve flicks, blanket work, and bow and arrow steps, splits, leg lifts and turns, etc., to combine them with ballet vocabulary. This combination generally still maintains the characteristics of ballet, that is, ballet is the main body, and national folk dance materials are unified into the artistic style of ballet.
    To create revolutionary ballet, it is necessary to make it understandable and enjoyable for the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To achieve this, there is not only the question of what content to express, but also the question of how to express it in order to better adapt to the appreciation habits of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. In order to make it understandable for the audience, the ballet creators conducted many explorations and attempts from content to form. In addition to adhering to the principle of form serving content, they also made positive efforts to strengthen the drama of the dance, adopt a combination of virtual and real expressions, and make the plot as coherent, layered, and clearly explained as possible in the dramatic structure. In particular, they boldly broke the old convention of ballet "not speaking" and added accompaniment singing, creating a new form of ballet with singing and dancing. The addition of singing unified the auditory and visual images, which is more conducive to showing the theme and the characters' thoughts and feelings, strengthening the dramatic atmosphere, helping the audience understand the plot, shortening the distance between the audience and the ballet, and strengthening the emotional exchange between the positive characters and the audience; at the same time, it also stimulated the inner emotions of the actors, making them dance better and with more emotion. For example, in the seventh scene, when Xi'er was rescued by Dachun and the villagers, and the bright red sun illuminated the cave, impassioned singing rang out: "The sun is coming out, shining brightly. ... The sun is Chairman Mao, the sun is the Communist Party." This song sang the feelings of infinite gratitude and love of Xi'er and all the masses for the Party and Chairman Mao, and sang the passion that dance cannot fully express. At this time, the song and dance were unified into a complete artistic image, producing a powerful artistic infection force.

    Adding singing is a new attempt and creation in ballet, especially in ballet music. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers like it very much. A comrade said it well:
  "Politics took the lead, and ballet opened its mouth." It's a good thing that ballet can open its mouth, so that everyone can understand it and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers better. What's wrong with that?

    The entire ballet music also plays an important role in the revolutionization, nationalization, and massification of "The White-Haired Girl." The creators enriched and developed the opera music based on the needs of the content and the characteristics of the ballet, creating many passionate, sonorous, simple, and moving new songs and new dances, and selected excellent revolutionary songs. In order to make the masses understand and like to listen, the creators did not engage in overly complex orchestration and harmony, and strived to maintain the national characteristics of melody. Therefore, the entire ballet music has a distinct national style, making people feel very kind when listening to it.
        Repeated Practice, Continuous Revolution

    Chairman Mao said: "A correct understanding often needs to go through a process of repeated repetitions from matter to spirit and from spirit to matter, that is, from practice to understanding and from understanding to practice, before it can be completed." The creation process of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is a process of repeated practice and continuous revolution.
    A prominent feature of the creation process of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is: clear direction, great determination, and steady steps. The comrades of the dance school honestly listened to the teachings of the Party, adhered to the revolutionary direction, threw themselves into the battle with full revolutionary enthusiasm, believed that the ballet revolution would definitely achieve victory, and believed that as long as they dared to make revolution and dared to practice, there would be no insurmountable difficulties. However, in order to reduce the blindness in creative practice and take fewer detours, they also adopted a method of proceeding from small to large and moving forward steadily: first conduct small-scale experiments, break through a little, gain experience, and then expand the results, and gradually recognize and grasp the creative laws of revolutionary ballet. The choreographers first selected fragments of plots from the opera and tried to express them in the form of a small ballet, which resulted in considerable success. The experiments from small to medium created conditions for the birth of the large-scale "The White-Haired Girl" in both ideological and material terms.

    The comrades of the dance school realized in their creative practice that the experience, methods, theories, etc. of revolutionary ballet creation can only be created through revolutionary practice, and can only be tested in practice for their correctness. Ballet revolution is a new undertaking, and different opinions will inevitably arise in the process of revolutionary practice. Views often differ on some specific creative and artistic treatment issues. When this happens, the approach of the dance school leaders is: not to rush to conclusions, encourage everyone to boldly put forward their own opinions and ideas, conduct various experiments under the premise of adhering to the direction, and also allow different opinions and allow for failures. Let practice test which opinion is more correct or better. For example, in the fourth scene, there was a difference of opinion on the issue of virtuality and reality when designing the stage background, props, and Xi'er - White-Haired Girl's dance movements. Some advocated complete virtuality (i.e., no props), some advocated complete reality, and some advocated a combination of virtuality and reality. Which method is better? Through repeated experiments, it turned out that: the audience could not understand it if it was completely virtual; it would affect the full play of the dance if it was completely real; starting from life, a combination of virtuality and reality not only fully utilized the dance expertise, but also made the audience understand the plot. Doing so can form a new artistic style, and as long as it is handled well, there will be no problems of inconsistency or incoordination in style.

    The creation process of "The White-Haired Girl" also proves that revolutionary practice can not only produce experience and wisdom, but also courage and confidence. The creators had an experience: the less practice there is on those issues, the more "fear" there is in the mind. For example, fearing the addition of singing to the ballet, fearing to choreograph duets, etc. The issue of adding singing was raised a long time ago. But they were afraid that others would not recognize it, that it would become something that was neither fish nor fowl, and they did not dare to practice it. Later, the leadership instructed: be sure to use the singing and dancing form that the people like to see, don't be afraid that others will not recognize it, as long as the workers and peasants recognize it, don't be afraid that it doesn't look like ballet, what's wrong with having one more form of serving socialism? Only then did the creators resolve to try it. At first, they only added singing between the acts, and later it developed into accompaniment singing in the act, and the effect was very good, breaking the long-standing superstition that ballet could not speak, and it was very popular among the masses.
    The process of repeated practice is a process of continuous revolution. "The White-Haired Girl" has been revised dozens of times from small to medium to large. From the first performance of the large-scale version to the present, it has been revised as many as fifty or sixty times. In this process, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School have always adhered to using ideological revolution to drive artistic revolution, and strived to turn the Party's instructions and the opinions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers into their own practical actions, doing what the Party tells them to do and what the workers, peasants, and soldiers hope them to do.
        Relying on the Masses, Internal and External Collaboration

    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" was also produced by relying on the mass line.
    Chairman Mao said: "The people have unlimited creativity." "We have always advocated that the revolution should rely on the people, everyone should do it, and oppose relying only on a few people to issue orders." Chairman Mao's words overcame the idea of some comrades who were worried that without professional creators, they would not be able to create a revolutionary ballet quickly, and made everyone realize that relying on the masses for revolution is not only a question of method, but also a question of class line. Making bourgeois ballets is for a few people and can only rely on a few people; making proletarian ballets is for the majority of people and must rely on everyone. As long as we rely on the masses and fully develop the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, a large number of revolutionary ballet art experts who do not seek fame or profit will emerge.

    The creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is the product of the combination of leaders and the masses, and the collective labor result of all teachers and students. The Party and government leaders of the dance school first managed politics and thought, and at the same time actively participated in the creation of "The White-Haired Girl." On the one hand, they timely implemented the instructions of the higher-level leaders and the opinions of the worker-peasant masses into the creation of "The White-Haired Girl," and on the other hand, they mobilized and called on all teachers and students to contribute their ideas and suggestions to the creation of revolutionary ballet. Therefore, from the school leaders to every teacher, student, and staff member, under the ideological guidance of doing everything for the revolution, everyone strived to contribute their share to the ballet revolution. As a result, a lively situation was formed in which everyone started and everyone "started the machine." All teachers, students, and staff, under the leadership of the Party branch, formed a strong collective under the same revolutionary goal, and the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is the crystallization of the wisdom of this collective.

    The ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is also the product of the revolutionary large-scale collaboration of more than a dozen literary and art units in Shanghai. This collaboration is very prominent in terms of the number of participants, the breadth of the field (including art guidance, composition, accompaniment, stage art, makeup, etc.), and the length of time. The collaborators not only came with the experience of revolutionary art creation, but more importantly, they listened to the Party, brought Chairman Mao's works, and came with the idea of creating for the revolution. They regarded the creation of "The White-Haired Girl" as an art revolution, so they were not afraid of new tasks and high demands, did not care about working conditions, regarded helping the dance school as their own work, and took the initiative to overcome all kinds of difficulties they had never encountered before, and harmoniously completed the collaboration task.

    Listening extensively and humbly to the criticisms and opinions of the worker-peasant masses is one of the important reasons why the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" was able to achieve success. The comrades of the dance school took this as an important measure to improve thinking and improve creation. From small to medium to large, they organized six worker-peasant-soldier symposiums. The worker-peasant-soldier masses put forward more than 200 suggestions for improvement to "The White-Haired Girl," including the theme, characters, dance movements, performing techniques, accompaniment singing, and even stage art. These opinions were not only ideologically clear, but also profound, specific, and practical. The leaders of the dance school sorted out these opinions and organized all the creators to study them as an important basis for continuously improving the quality of creation. The ballet creators not only gained deep inspiration from the opinions of the workers, peasants, and soldiers on how to highlight class struggle and strengthen the resistance of characters, but also gained inspiration from the workers, peasants, and soldiers in many specific artistic treatments. For example, Zhao Da's uncle instructed Da Chun and others to join the Eighth Route Army, and red light should be projected from the background; Da Chun and Xi'er used a duet form to express their reunion; when the landlord Huang Shiren and his lackey Mu Renzhi were shot, the gunshots should be loud and powerful, etc., all of which were revised by adopting the opinions of the worker-peasant-soldier audience. The clear political attitude and deep class feelings of the worker-peasant-soldier masses towards revolutionary art creation were particularly profound for the education of the ballet creators. Their words full of strong revolutionary feelings gave the entire staff and students of the dance school great encouragement.
                           ×××
    In the past two years, the creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" has experienced an extraordinary road. A new force has emerged on the stage of revolutionary ballet art in China. Through the flexible study and application of Chairman Mao's works and the training of actual creation, they are growing up. However, the teachers and students of the Shanghai Dance School are still very young after all. Both in terms of ideological training, artistic cultivation, and basic skills, they are still far from the Party's requirements. They realize that the creation of the ballet "The White-Haired Girl" is only a new beginning of the ballet revolution, and they have only taken the first step of the Long March. They especially feel that there are still many shortcomings in the ballet "The White-Haired Girl," both in terms of ideological content and artistic treatment, which need to be further improved, and there are many problems that need to be further explored. For all teachers and students, they still need to further deepen their lives, strive to combine with the worker-peasant masses, and need to better study Chairman Mao's works, further highlight politics, continuously improve class consciousness, and strengthen self-transformation. They are determined to turn the Party's expectations into their own determination: to make revolution, we must persevere to the end and never give up halfway. For "The White-Haired Girl," even if it is revised a thousand times, ten thousand times, and revised for ten or eight years, we must continue to revise it, and we must revise it well, and strive to make more and better contributions to the continuous prosperity and development of my country's revolutionary ballet art.

    标社会主义之新  立无产阶级之异
    ——大型革命现代芭蕾舞剧 《白毛女》的诞生
    余鲁元
    编者按：上海市舞蹈学校根据同名歌剧改编的大型革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》即将在首都公演。这里发表的文章说明：这出舞剧是继《红色娘子军》以后芭蕾革命所取得的又一巨大成果。它的诞生再一次证明：象芭蕾舞、交响乐这些外来的古典的艺术形式，是完全可以根据“外为中用”、“古为今用”的原则加以改造，来为我们的社会主义事业服务的。
    毛主席教导我们：“文学艺术中对于古人和外国人的毫无批判的硬搬和模仿，乃是最没有出息的最害人的文学教条主义和艺术教条主义。”上海市舞蹈学校的师生们高举毛泽东思想红旗，敢于标新立异——“标”社会主义之“新”，“立”无产阶级之“异”，打破老框框、洋教条，为芭蕾舞艺术进一步实现革命化、民族化、群众化拓宽了道路。
    上海市舞蹈学校根据同名歌剧再创作的大型革命芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》，是继《红色娘子军》以后芭蕾革命所取得的又一成果。它以深刻的革命内容，强烈的时代精神和为群众所喜闻乐见的艺术新风格，赢得了工农兵群众热烈的赞扬。
    一个创办只有六年的舞蹈学校，在完全没有经验，没有专业创作和编导人员的条件下，高举毛泽东思想红旗，标社会主义之新，立无产阶级之异，敢于对被有些人认为是“至高无上”的“艺术顶峰”的古典芭蕾艺术进行革命，在短短一年多的时间内，就创作出一个有较高的思想水平和艺术水平的革命芭蕾舞剧，为芭蕾舞剧进一步实现革命化、民族化、群众化积累了新的经验。这是突出政治的胜利，是毛泽东思想的胜利；是上海市舞蹈学校师生坚决贯彻文艺为工农兵服务的方向，实行思想革命和艺术革命所取得的可喜的收获。
      突出政治，大闹芭蕾革命
    上海市舞蹈学校的师生们是怎样开始进行芭蕾革命的呢？他们是从学习毛主席著作，实行人的思想革命化开始的。
    过去，在音乐舞蹈界，多次展开过关于芭蕾民族化、群众化的争论。可是，有些同志争来争去，却多半停留在形式问题上，不懂得要民族化、群众化，首先要革命化。两年以前，舞蹈学校师生对于芭蕾舞剧能不能反映革命现代生活，也存在着种种疑问。其中就有这样两种看法：一曰“无害论”，一曰“遥远论”。所谓
  “无害论”，是认为芭蕾舞“不过是百花中的一花，在晚会上演一些无害的作品，有什么不可以？”所谓“遥远论”，是认为芭蕾艺术要实现革命化、民族化、群众化，那只能是“遥远的将来”的事。象《天鹅湖》这种“至高无上的经典著作”，“学会它就很不容易，还谈得上自己创作？”这两种看法归结起来只有一句话：芭蕾艺术不必革命，也很难革命。
    一九六三年底到一九六四年初，在上海举行了华东地区话剧现代戏观摩演出，他们从中得到很大启发，特别是在北京举行了全国京剧现代戏观摩演出，产生了《红灯记》《沙家浜》等好样板之后，全国范围内形成的一个前所未有的大演革命现代戏的热潮，有力地推动舞蹈学校师生的思想革命化。一九六四年春节，舞蹈学校师生下农村和部队演出，亲身感受到工农兵群众对革命现代戏的热情欢迎和支持，看到了广大工农兵业余文艺工作者演革命现代戏的革命劲头，再也平静不下来了。在他们的思想上不能不产生一个十分尖锐的问题：芭蕾艺术究竟为谁服务？是为最大多数的工农兵群众服务，为社会主义经济基础、为无产阶级政治服务呢，还是为地主资产阶级和他们的遗老遗少服务？舞蹈学校党支部及时组织大家带着问题学习毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》，毛主席说得很清楚：“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”革命的文艺，应该为最大多数的工农兵群众服务，“成为整个革命机器的一个组成部分，作为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”。他们用毛泽东思想对照自己的思想状况和教学、演出的现状，感到问题十分严重。毛泽东思想擦亮了大家的眼睛，使他们认识到所谓“无害论”和“遥远论”，都是完全错误的。有的学生深有感触地说：“我们演出那些宣扬资产阶级个人主义、人道主义的艺术作品，是心目中离开了工农兵群众，从精神上挖社会主义的墙脚。”有的师生原先以为为工农兵服务，就是多演几场《天鹅湖》给工农兵看，至于给他们看什么内容的艺术，他们需要不需要，那是他们的事；工农兵看不懂，那是因为他们欣赏水平低。这时开始认识到这种思想实际上就是拒绝为工农兵服务。芭蕾舞剧究竟怎样才能为工农兵服务呢？他们终于在毛主席著作中找到了答案。
    通过毛主席著作的学习，舞蹈学校全体师生经历了一个深刻的自我思想斗争，大大促进了他们的思想革命化。师生们决心遵照毛主席的指示，用愚公移山的精神来攻克古典芭蕾艺术这个堡垒，使它从洋才子佳人的圈子中解放出来，真正成为团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力武器。
    舞剧《白毛女》的诞生，证明了一个真理：人们一旦用毛泽东思想武装起来，就能够产生强大的物质力量。一九六四年到一九六五年春天这一年多的时间里，上海市舞蹈学校的客观条件并没有变化，他们还是没有专业创作和编导人员，还是只有几个年青的教师，还是只有几十个学生，可是，原先不敢想象的事情，却成了现实。开初连舞剧台本都不懂怎么编的青年教师，终于完成了大型革命芭蕾舞剧的编导工作；从来没有写过芭蕾舞剧乐曲的作曲者，为《白毛女》写出了具有强烈的革命气势和鲜明的民族风格的乐曲和舞曲；平均年龄不过二十岁的年青学生，征服了一个又一个从来没有学过的高难度的动作，并相当出色地完成了角色的创造。这就充分说明，芭蕾革命，主要是靠政治，靠毛泽东思想，靠人的革命精神。有了政治，有了毛泽东思想，就会调动一切积极性，去努力提高技巧。
    要革命，就不可能没有困难。但是，只要突出政治，突出毛泽东思想，困难就可以克服，不利因素可以化为有利因素。革命的辩证法就是这样。例如技巧不够，是个困难，是个不利因素，但是演员们都有这样的体会：“技巧是靠人去掌握的，要提高技巧，首先就得提高人的思想。无产阶级思想感情不深厚，这才是提高技巧的最大困难。只要把毛主席的话化为行动，带着阶级感情去革命，就能排除万难。”至于编导革命芭蕾舞剧的经验，也只有握掌毛泽东思想，通过革命实践去创造；不革命就永远得不到这种经验。
      突出阶级斗争，为贫下中农立传
    舞剧《白毛女》是在歌剧的基础上改编的，要将歌剧改编为芭蕾舞剧，必须有一个再认识和再创造的过程，必须付出艰巨的劳动。这不仅是由于芭蕾舞剧和歌剧是两种不同的艺术样式，更为重要的是，时代前进了，这就对改编者提出了新的更高的要求。在开始编导中型《白毛女》的时候，领导上就指出：处理《白毛女》这样的民主革命时期农村阶级关系的题材，必须根据社会主义时代精神，突出阶级剥削、阶级压迫、阶级反抗、阶级斗争，为贫下中农立传。这一指示就成了创作者的指导思想。可是要把这个指导思想贯彻到具体的创作中去，就不仅有一个艺术上的摸索过程，更重要的还有一个思想认识上的提高过程。舞剧创作人员在党的领导下，学习了毛主席关于阶级、阶级矛盾、阶级斗争的学说，运用毛主席的思想来分析题材和主题，进一步认识到杨白劳、喜儿、大春跟黄世仁的关系，是两个敌对阶级的你死我活的关系。喜儿和大春等的遭遇，正是旧中国千百万农民群众的生活命运的写照。哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗，有斗争。喜儿的反抗，大春的参军，正反映着广大贫农反压迫、求解放的强烈愿望；喜儿和大春所走的道路，也是中国广大农民所走过的历史道路。从这样的认识出发，创作者紧紧抓住阶级的对立和斗争这条红线，来结构剧情和处理人物之间的关系，把大春和喜儿的爱情关系，放在极次要的地位，把反剥削、反压迫的斗争，放在驾驭一切的头等地位。
    舞剧创作人员还从毛主席著作中进一步认识到，要正确表现民主革命时期农村的阶级斗争，就必须突出武装斗争。象第五场，原先着重于通过军民联欢来表现军民之间的亲密关系，这种处理，气氛虽然热烈，但缺乏明确的内容。现在改为八路军进村，发动群众、武装群众、开展反霸斗争。第八场，原先在枪毙黄世仁以后，大家欢庆解放，戏就结束了。现在加上尾声，让喜儿参军，坚决把革命进行到底。
    阶级斗争和武装斗争都离不开党的领导，舞剧编导不仅通过赵大叔和八路军的形象来体现党的作用，而且在喜儿被救出，斗争取得胜利以后，把群众对党对伟大领袖毛主席的无限感激和爱戴之情，以生动的形式集中地表现了出来。“太阳就是毛泽东，太阳就是共产党”，这两句唱词，唱出了广大农民发自肺腑的心声，这样的处理，使得全剧成为一首对农民群众的阶级反抗和武装革命的颂歌，成为一首对党、对毛主席的颂歌，这就进一步深化和提高了戏的主题。
    要正确表现阶级反抗和武装斗争，关键在于塑造好杨白劳、喜儿、大春、赵大叔等人物形象，通过他们来表现贫农的反抗性和革命性，从中型《白毛女》开始，舞剧编导就尝试着对几个主要的贫农形象作新的处理：
    杨白劳，被塑造为一个富于反抗性的老贫农的形象。他是当地主登门逼债，强抢喜儿时，奋起抗击，致遭毒打而死。这样的死所显示的精神品格，是积极的、富于斗争性的。
    舞剧把喜儿的形象塑造得很好，她在阶级敌人的面前，表现出一种不畏强暴，敢于斗争到底的坚强性格。舞剧着重通过几个重要的环节来展示喜儿性格的成长和发展：父亲的死和自己被抢，激起她强烈的阶级仇恨，决心要报这血海深仇；在黄家受尽虐待，更加强了她的反抗意志，她要冲出黄家的门，要活，要报仇；在荒山野林中的非人生活以及和大自然所作的斗争，使她胸中的仇恨越积越深，也使她的性格变得更坚强，所以当她在奶奶庙遇上不共戴天的仇人时，满腔的怒火，就象火山一样爆发了。这样，一个坚强不屈的贫农女儿的形象，就鲜明地树立起来了。
    赵大叔和大春，舞剧也作了新的处理：前者成为一个沉着老练的地下党员的形象，而后者则从一个青年贫农成长为坚强的八路军干部。
    对这些主要的正面人物形象所作的处理，究竟是否合适？究竟是更真实、更典型了呢，还是相反？杨白劳在逼债、女儿被抢、遭打的情况下敢于打地主是不是可信呢？喜儿的性格是不是“太高了”？喜儿敢于打黄世仁是“太野了”吗？喜儿会有这样强烈的性格吗？这些问题归结起来，实际上是一个对民主革命时期贫农群众的阶级品质如何理解，以及在社会主义艺术舞台上究竟应该树立什么样的贫农典型的问题。
    为了解决上述问题，上海市舞蹈学校党支部组织全体师生大学毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》和《湖南农民运动考察报告》这两篇文章。毛主席说得很清楚，在民主革命时期的中国农村中，贫农一向是革命主力、“革命先锋”，“他们和土豪劣绅是死对头，他们毫不迟疑地向土豪劣绅营垒进攻”。这些指示，给了上述问题以最明确的解答。为了加深对毛主席指示的理解，舞蹈学校领导又在大型《白毛女》创作前后，组织全体师生参加农村的社会主义教育运动，同时阅读四川“白毛女”罗文秀的事迹，听取工农兵观众对杨白劳、喜儿处理的意见。这样，就大大提高了全体创作人员的思想认识，增强了他们的阶级感情。他们认识到，喜儿和杨白劳等贫农的反抗性在当时环境中完全是真实的，代表着事物的本质和主流，应该把喜儿、大春、杨白劳、赵大叔作为中国贫农的阶级代表在舞台上高高地树立起来，通过他们来歌颂劳动人民的革命精神，去激励千百万群众的心灵，鼓舞他们的斗争意志。
    思想认识提高了，就进一步推进了创作。他们发现，最初对许多情节的处理，不是把喜儿等的形象写得“太高了”，太强烈了，而是还不能充分表现他们的反抗性。例如让喜儿下跪给黄母捶腿，在她打了黄世仁的耳光以后，就立即缩手，逃下场去，这些处理都显然有损于喜儿的性格。创作者学习了芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》和京剧《红灯记》塑造英雄人物的宝贵经验，修改了情节，改进了舞蹈和音乐，进一步加强了喜儿的性格，使她在阶级敌人面前，在精神上和气势上都压倒对方，从而使这一形象显得更为高大。
    大胆突破旧形式，创造革命的新形式
    要用芭蕾舞剧这一外国的古典艺术形式来反映现代中国工农兵群众的斗争生活，为我国的社会主义革命和建设服务，为工农兵所理解和接受，就不能不碰到很多矛盾和困难。其中最基本的矛盾之一，就是旧的艺术形式和新的革命的思想内容之间的矛盾。
    舞剧的创作人员是怎样解决这一矛盾，从而取得形式和内容较好的结合的呢？他们所遵循的一条基本原则就是：从革命的现实生活出发，从思想内容和人物性格的需要出发，来利用和改造旧的艺术形式，创造革命芭蕾舞剧的新形式。
    古典芭蕾艺术形式，虽然有些技术和舞蹈语汇，提供了可以为我们利用的条件；但是它的形式、规格、技巧，以至所谓轻盈典雅的舞姿和表演风格，都深深地打着外国资产阶级的生活方式和思想感情的烙印。如果原封不动地把这些东西用来表现中国劳动人民的革命现代生活，那就必然要歪曲生活，丑化工农兵形象，所以，要利用，就首先得改造；要改造，就得敢于破，敢于立。有破有立，才有发展，有创造。所谓破，就是要突破古典芭蕾原有的凝固了的艺术形式，不为它的一套框框、程式、规格所束缚。他们的做法是：坚持从表现生活和人物性格的需要出发，对古典芭蕾的表演形式、语汇和技巧，能用的，经过适当改造，尽量利用；不能用的，就决不因为要保留某种技巧而勉强使用。如果在芭蕾中找不到适合的语汇和表达方式，就从我国民族民间舞蹈和戏曲中去吸取素材。无论是芭蕾或其它舞蹈素材，都不是原样照搬，而是经过一个选择、改造和重新组合的过程。
    舞剧创作者在实践中深深体会到，只有人民群众的斗争生活才是艺术创作的唯一源泉，过去时代的芭蕾舞剧艺术作品是流而不是源，它只能作为革命芭蕾舞剧创作的借鉴。他们在解决旧形式与新内容的矛盾中所积累的一条重要经验是：先吃透生活，再考虑形式，再提炼舞蹈动作。这就是说：在充分理解所要表现的生活内容和人物的思想感情的基础上，寻找最恰当的艺术形式。举个例来说：白毛女在奶奶庙，从雷电的闪光中发现了不共戴天的仇人黄世仁和穆仁智。这时她的内心感情是：“见仇人，烈火烧，……我要把他撕成千万条。”在这个规定情景中，白毛女应该怎样行动呢？她一定要不顾一切地去追打仇人。编导们正是从这样的理解出发，编出了一段白毛女追打黄世仁的舞蹈，十分有力地表达了喜儿烈火般的阶级仇恨，和无所畏惧的斗争精神。这样的舞蹈组合，虽然舞蹈素材仍然取自芭蕾，但从根本意义上说，却又是生活动作的艺术化、舞蹈化。
    有人也许会问：坚持从革命的政治内容出发，从生活出发，来改造芭蕾艺术，会不会破坏芭蕾的特点呢？如果这个特点是指那飘飘欲仙的“华美的姿态”，“表演者天生的文雅”等等，那是肯定要破坏掉的。不破坏，要反映工农兵的斗争生活和他们的思想感情，要形成革命芭蕾的艺术新风格就根本不可能。如果这特点是指芭蕾的基本形式和技巧，那么，表现革命的新生活，塑造工农兵的英雄形象，正可以使它们经过脱胎换骨而得到新的生命，得到丰富和发展。《白毛女》的创作实践表明，由于所表现的革命的生活内容的丰富多采，所以芭蕾舞的长处（如开阔奔放，动作大、跳跃性强等）和它的基本形式（独舞、双人舞、群舞）和技巧（包括许多难度很高的技巧动作），只要在生活内容的基础上加以改造和发展，就可以得到充分的发挥和利用。同时还需要用民族民间舞蹈（包括戏曲、拳术等）之长来补芭蕾之不足。舞剧创作者吸取了我国戏曲舞蹈艺术中的丰富的身段、手势和面部表情动作，把它们融化于芭蕾之中；又运用了我国戏曲舞蹈中的一些独特的表现方式、技巧和动作，象亮相、甩水袖、毯子功以及弓剑步、劈叉、吸腿翻身，等等，使之和芭蕾语汇相结合。这种组合，一般仍然保持芭蕾的特点，也就是以芭蕾为主，使民族民间舞蹈素材统一于芭蕾的艺术风格之中。
    创作革命的芭蕾舞剧，一定要让工农兵群众看得懂，喜欢看。要做到这一点，不仅有表现什么内容的问题，而且有如何表现才能更好地适应工农兵欣赏习惯的问题。为了让观众们看得懂，舞剧创作者从内容到形式进行了多方面的探索和尝试。除了坚持形式服从于内容的原则以外，在加强舞蹈的戏剧性，采用虚实结合的表现方法，在戏剧结构上尽可能做到情节联贯，层次分明，交代清楚等方面，都作了积极的努力。特别是大胆打破了芭蕾舞剧“不开口”的陈规，加了伴唱，创造了芭蕾舞剧载歌载舞的新形式。加了唱，使听觉形象和视觉形象统一了起来，更有利于展示主题和人物的思想感情，加强戏剧气氛，帮助观众理解剧情，缩短观众和舞剧的距离，加强正面人物和观众之间的情感交流；同时更激发了演员的内心情绪，使他们舞得更好，更有感情。例如第七场，当喜儿被大春和乡亲们救出，鲜红的太阳照亮了山洞时，响起了激情洋溢的歌声：“太阳出来了，光芒万丈。……太阳就是毛主席，太阳就是共产党。”这歌声，唱出了喜儿和所有的群众对党对毛主席万分感激和爱戴的心情，唱出了舞蹈不易充分表达的激情。这时，歌声和舞蹈统一成为一个完整的艺术形象，产生一种强大的艺术感染力量。
    加唱，这是芭蕾舞剧、特别是舞剧音乐的一项新的尝试和创造。加了唱，广大的工农兵群众十分喜欢。有位同志说得好：
  “政治带了头，芭蕾开了口。”芭蕾能开口，让大家都看得懂，能更好地为工农兵服务，这有什么不好呢？
    整个舞剧音乐对《白毛女》的革命化、民族化、群众化也起着重要的作用。创作者在歌剧音乐的基础上根据内容的需要和舞剧的特点加以丰富和发展，创作了许多激昂高亢、朴实感人的新歌曲和新舞曲，并选用了优秀的革命歌曲。为使群众听得懂，喜欢听，创作者不搞过于复杂的配器、和声，力求保持以旋律为主的民族特色。因此，整个舞剧音乐，具有鲜明的民族风格，听起来使人感到十分亲切。
        反复实践，不断革命
    毛主席说：“一个正确的认识，往往需要经过由物质到精神，由精神到物质，即由实践到认识，由认识到实践这样多次的反复，才能够完成。”舞剧《白毛女》的创作过程，正是一个反复实践，不断革命的过程。
    舞剧《白毛女》创作过程的一个显著特点是：方向明，决心大，步子稳。舞蹈学校同志老老实实听从党的教导，坚持革命方向，以充沛的革命热情投入战斗，相信芭蕾革命一定可以取得胜利，相信只要敢于革命，勇于实践，就没有克服不了的困难。但是，为了减少创作实践中的盲目性，少走一些弯路，他们又采取由小到大，稳步前进的方法：先通过小型试验，突破一点，取得经验，然后扩大战果，并且逐步认识和掌握革命芭蕾舞剧的创作规律。编导们在开始先选取歌剧中的片断情节，尝试用小型芭蕾舞剧的形式表现出来，结果取得了相当大的成功。从小型到中型的试验，为大型《白毛女》的诞生，从思想和物质两方面，创造了条件。
    舞蹈学校同志在创作实践中体会到，革命芭蕾舞剧创作的经验、方法、理论等等，只有通过革命实践去创造，也只能通过实践才能检验其是否正确。芭蕾革命，这是一个新的事业，在革命实践的过程中，一定会产生不同的意见。在一些具体的创作和艺术处理问题上，看法也常常会不一致。遇到这种情况时，舞蹈学校领导的做法是：不忙于做结论，鼓励大家大胆提出自己的意见和设想，在坚持方向的前提下，进行多种试验，也允许坚持不同的意见，允许有失败。让实践来检验那一种意见更正确或更好些。例如在第四场。在设计舞台背景、道具和喜儿——白毛女的舞蹈动作的时候，在虚实问题上就产生了意见分歧。有的主张全虚（即不用任何道具），有的主张全实，有的则主张有虚有实。究竟哪一种方法更好一些呢？通过反复试验，结果证明：全虚了，观众看不懂；全实了，会影响舞蹈的充分发挥；从生活出发，有虚有实、虚实结合，既充分发挥了舞蹈特长，又使观众看懂了剧情。这样做，正可以形成一种新的艺术风格，只要处理得好，就不会产生风格不统一，不协调的问题。
    《白毛女》的创作过程还证明，革命实践不仅可以出经验、出智慧，也能够出勇气，出信心。创作者有一个体会：那些问题上实践得少了，思想上的“怕”字就多了。例如怕舞剧加唱，怕编双人舞等。加唱的问题，很早就有人提过。可是就怕别人不承认，怕搞成四不象，没敢去实践一下。后来领导上指示：一定用人民群众所喜闻乐见的载歌载舞的形式，不要怕别人不承认，只要工农群众承认就好，也不要怕不象芭蕾，多一种为社会主义服务的形式，有什么不好？创作者这才下决心去试一试。开初还只在幕间加唱，后来发展到幕中伴唱，结果效果很好，打破了长期以来芭蕾不能开口的迷信，大受群众欢迎。
    反复实践的过程，就是一个不断革命的过程。《白毛女》从小型到中型到大型，前后修改了数十次。单从大型第一次演出到现在，就修改了五、六十次之多。在这一过程中，上海舞蹈学校师生始终坚持以思想革命带动艺术革命，努力把党的指示和工农兵群众的意见，化为自己的实际行动，做到党叫怎么做就怎么做，工农兵群众希望怎么做就怎么做。
        依靠群众，内外协作
    芭蕾舞剧《白毛女》也是靠大走群众路线产生出来的。
    毛主席说：“人民群众有无限的创造力。”“我们历来主张革命要依靠人民群众，大家动手，反对只依靠少数人发号施令。”毛主席的话，克服了有些同志担心没有专业创作人员，不能很快创作出革命芭蕾舞剧的思想，使大家认识到，革命靠群众，不仅是一个方法问题，而是一个阶级路线问题。搞资产阶级的芭蕾舞剧是为少数人，只能靠少数人；搞无产阶级的芭蕾舞剧是为多数人，就一定要靠大家动手。只要依靠群众，充分发扬群众的积极性和创造性，就会出现大批不为名、不为利的革命芭蕾艺术专家。
    舞剧《白毛女》的创作，是领导和群众相结合的产物，是全体师生的集体劳动成果。舞蹈学校的党政领导，首先是管政治，管思想，同时也积极参与《白毛女》的创作，他们一方面及时把上级领导的指示和工农群众的意见，贯彻到《白毛女》的创作中去，同时又动员和号召全体师生为创作革命的芭蕾舞剧献计献策。所以从校领导开始，到每一个教师、学生和职工，都在一切工作为革命这一思想指导下，人人争先，为芭蕾革命贡献自己的一份力量。结果就形成了一个人人动手，大家“开动机器”的生动活泼的局面，全体师生员工，在党支部的领导下，在同一个革命目标之下，形成了一个坚强的集体，而舞剧《白毛女》，就是这一集体的智慧的结晶。
    舞剧《白毛女》又是上海十几个文艺单位革命大协作的产物。这次大协作，参加人员之多，方面之广（包括艺术指导、作曲、伴唱、舞台美术、化装等各个方面），时间之长，都是很突出的。协作者不仅带着革命艺术创作的经验而来，更重要的，他们是听党的话，带着毛主席著作，带着为革命而创作的思想而来，他们把创作《白毛女》看作是一场艺术革命，所以他们不怕任务新、要求高，不计较工作条件，把帮助舞蹈学校当做自己的工作，主动克服种种从未遇到过的困难，和谐地完成了协作任务。
    广泛、虚心地听取工农群众的批评和意见，是舞剧《白毛女》能够取得成功的重要原因之一，舞蹈学校的同志把这一条作为提高思想、改进创作的重要措施。从小型到中型到大型，他们前后组织了六次工农兵座谈会。工农兵群众对《白毛女》先后提出了二百多条改进意见，包括主题、人物、舞蹈动作、表演技巧、伴唱以至舞台美术各个方面。这些意见不仅思想鲜明，而且深刻具体，切合实际。舞蹈学校领导把这些意见整理出来，组织全体创作人员学习，作为不断提高创作质量的重要依据。舞剧创作人员不仅在如何突出阶级斗争，加强人物性格的反抗性等方面，从工农兵的意见中得到深刻的启示，而且在许多具体的艺术处理上，也从工农兵那里得到启发。象赵大叔指示大春等参加八路军，背景要有红光射出来；大春和喜儿相认时用对唱的形式来表达；地主黄世仁及狗腿子穆仁智枪毙时，枪声要响亮有力等，就都是采纳了工农兵观众的意见而修改的。工农兵群众对待革命艺术创作的鲜明的政治态度和深厚的阶级感情，对于舞剧创作人员的教育尤其深刻。他们充满强烈的革命感情的话，给予舞蹈学校全体师生以莫大的鼓舞。
                           ×××
    两年来，舞剧《白毛女》的创作，经历了一段不平凡的道路。在我国革命芭蕾艺术舞台上，出现了一支新兵，他们通过活学活用毛主席著作和实际创作的锻炼，正在成长之中。但是，上海舞蹈学校的师生们毕竟还很年轻，无论在思想锻炼、艺术修养和基本功方面都与党的要求还有距离。他们认识到，舞剧《白毛女》的创作，还只是芭蕾革命的一个新的开始，他们还只是走了万里长征的第一步。他们特别感到，舞剧《白毛女》无论在思想内容上和艺术处理上，都还存在许多不足之处，有待于进一步提高，有许多问题还有待作进一步探索。对于全体师生来说，他们还需要进一步深入生活，努力实现与工农群众相结合，还需要更好地学习毛主席著作，进一步突出政治，不断提高阶级觉悟，加强自我改造。他们决心把党的期望变成自己的决心：要革命，就坚持到底，决不半途而废。对《白毛女》，哪怕再改一千遍，一万遍，改上十年八年，也要改下去，而且一定要改好它，争取进一步为我国革命芭蕾艺术的不断繁荣发展作出更多更好的贡献。
