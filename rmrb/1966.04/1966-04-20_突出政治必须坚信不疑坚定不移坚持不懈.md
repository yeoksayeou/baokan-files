    The Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps of the People’s Liberation Army held an enlarged meeting to discuss how to correctly handle the relationship between politics and engineering, using vivid facts to illustrate that emphasizing politics in grasping engineering fundamentally improves engineering, while neglecting politics in pursuing engineering fundamentally undermines engineering.
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 19th) The Party Committee of the Railway Engineering Corps of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently held an enlarged meeting of its Party Committee to thoroughly study Chairman Mao's thesis that politics is the commander and soul, and that political work is the lifeline of all work, as well as the five principles of emphasizing politics put forward by Comrade Lin Biao and the spirit of the All-Army Political Work Conference.  The meeting conducted a heated discussion on the fundamental issue of how to correctly handle the relationship between politics and engineering. People from construction sites of the Railway Engineering Corps used their personal experiences and vivid facts to illustrate that politics and engineering are in a commanding and subordinate relationship, a primary and secondary relationship.  No matter when or under what circumstances, it is imperative to emphasize politics and put political work first, and not to emphasize engineering or technology. They said: of all the many things to do, studying Chairman Mao's works is the most important; of all the many changes, emphasizing politics cannot change; of all the many difficulties, adhering to the "Four Firsts" makes things not difficult.

    Engineering Subordinates to Politics, So as Not to Lose Direction
    The meeting earnestly criticized a series of erroneous viewpoints and vague understandings such as "politics should subordinate to engineering" and "engineering is politics." The meeting pointed out that the statement that "road construction is the basic task of the Railway Engineering Corps, and politics should subordinate to engineering" is essentially the idea of "engineering first" at work, which reverses the relationship between politics and engineering. Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: Politics is the commander and soul, and political work is the lifeline of all work. The relationship between politics and engineering should be that engineering subordinates to politics, not that politics subordinates to engineering. If we only emphasize engaging in engineering and do not emphasize politics, do not put political work in the first place, and do not use Mao Zedong Thought to arm the minds of all personnel, not only will the engineering tasks not be completed well, but we will also forget the enemy, suffer the erosion of bourgeois ideology, and suffer defeats in the three great revolutions of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation. As for saying that "good engineering is good politics, completing engineering tasks is emphasizing politics," and "of all the many things, laying two steel rails is the most important; of all the many good things, failing to complete the task is no good at all," this is merely a variation of the purely military viewpoint that Chairman Mao criticized at the Gutian Conference: "Good military affairs will naturally lead to good politics, and bad military affairs will also lead to bad politics." These comrades do not understand that all the revolutionary work we do belongs to proletarian politics, but its relationship with politics is that of part to whole. The engineering task is only a component of the political tasks we want to complete, not the entirety of the political tasks. Politics includes more content and a wider scope. It is a misinterpretation to believe that because engineering has political significance, there is no need to do political and ideological work. It is one thing that engineering tasks have political significance, but it is another whether people understand its political significance and are conscious when performing the tasks. Political work is precisely to do the work of raising people's awareness. The essence of saying "engineering is politics" is to replace politics with engineering, causing people to lose their political direction and go astray.

    The meeting pointed out that emphasizing politics should produce results in both material and spiritual aspects. The completion of engineering and other tasks is only one kind of result. There is another more important result, which is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fundamentally improve the class consciousness of commanders and fighters, ensure the Party's absolute leadership over the army, and ensure that commanders and fighters always listen to Chairman Mao's words, always follow the Party, never change their nature, and never become revisionist. They said that the guarantee that politics provides for engineering is not a technical guarantee, but a fundamental guarantee of political thought. It ensures that people everywhere take Chairman Mao's works as the highest instruction, create a strong atmosphere of studying Mao Zedong Thought, raise proletarian consciousness to a high level, boost morale sufficiently, maintain good unity, and deeply instill hatred for the enemy, so that no matter what arduous tasks are performed, they can be victorious in everything.

    Emphasizing Politics Can Overcome All Difficulties and Advance Victoriously
    At the enlarged meeting of the Party Committee, leaders and political workers from various units also exchanged experiences and understandings on correctly handling the relationship between politics and engineering. Many commanders and fighters from the forefront of construction said that the Railway Engineering Corps mostly works in remote areas year after year, where the environment is dangerous, the labor is intense, and the living conditions are hard. Only by emphasizing politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm everyone's minds, and enabling cadres and soldiers to establish the idea of building roads for the revolution, can they ensure that dangerous mountains and bad rivers cannot scare them, hard living conditions cannot drag them down, and that they can overcome all difficulties and advance victoriously. Personnel from a certain unit working on a mountainous construction site said that when their unit first arrived in the work area, there was no housing, no roads, and no sufficient water source. Faced with such a harsh environment, the unit's leadership firmly grasped the emphasis on politics, placing the living study and application of Mao Zedong Thought in the first place, and conducting discussions on the then-existing living thoughts of some people fearing hardship and difficulty. Everywhere on the construction site, Chairman Mao's quotations were displayed. The soldiers were "raising their heads to see quotations, lowering their heads to think about quotations, bringing quotations to work, and using quotations in their work." The cadres, on the other hand, "carried Chairman Mao's quotations with them, held loudspeakers in their hands, spoke a passage whenever they found the opportunity, and talked about good people and good deeds." Chairman Mao's teachings and active political and ideological work enabled the soldiers to further clarify why they were constructing and for whom they were constructing, and to clarify how to deal with hardship. They said: "No mountain is higher than the ambition of the Railway Engineering Corps; no rock is harder than the will of the Railway Engineering Corps; no stone is tougher than the bones of the Railway Engineering Corps." During construction, everyone was spirited, full of energy, overcame difficulties, changed the environment, and constantly created outstanding achievements. Comrades from a construction unit in the Northeast forest area also said that the forest area where they were working had always been known as a "high and cold restricted area" before liberation. Before their unit entered, the Party Committee first grasped politics, and the entire unit studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" ("Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains"), grasped the "Three Comparisons" (comparing hardship, fighting spirit, and contributions with the Red Army), and established the "Three Honors" (labor is honorable, hardship is honorable, being a member of the Railway Engineering Corps is honorable). The revolutionary spirit of the cadres and soldiers was greatly boosted. With the revolutionary spirit of daring to struggle and daring to win, they broke into the "restricted area" and launched a battle against the harsh natural environment. When there were no houses to live in, they pried open ice and snow and erected tents; when there was no water to drink, they melted snow; the Chinese cabbages were frozen like iron and stone, and they used axes to chop them because knives could not cut them. The unit also broke with convention and carried out winter construction in this virgin forest, completing the annual engineering task ahead of schedule.

    At the meeting, comrades from a certain unit also used the example of the Second Battalion of a certain regiment, during construction, emphasizing politics and not emphasizing politics to illustrate that emphasizing politics in grasping engineering fundamentally improves engineering, while neglecting politics in pursuing engineering fundamentally undermines engineering.

    Politics Commands Technology, Building High-Standard Projects
    When discussing the relationship between politics and technology, many comrades also used their personal experiences to illustrate the importance of politics commanding technology. They said that simply grasping technology leads to numerous difficulties, and technology cannot improve. Sometimes, even if it does improve, it is easy to see technology as a personal "iron rice bowl" and a source of pride, and it cannot be fully utilized in construction. With politics commanding technology, it is possible to overcome all difficulties, accelerate the progress of mastering complex technology, and cultivate revolutionary successors who are both red and expert. Personnel from a certain unit said that they were tasked with the finishing and supporting work for a railway in a certain area. Due to the high requirements of the project and the strong technical aspects, many new soldiers were unable to do the work, resulting in poor quality of some projects and rework. The Party organization of this unit resolutely emphasized politics, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching of wholeheartedly serving the people, and discussed "whether people control technology, or whether technology overwhelms people." After study and discussion, everyone realized that: we are soldiers of Chairman Mao, and we must use the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people to demand ourselves, and make the greatest effort to learn construction technology, and build high-standard railways for the revolution. Under the guidance of this thought, the soldiers consciously worked hard to practice their skills, quickly mastered the technology relatively skillfully, and in the finishing and supporting work, with a highly responsible and meticulous spirit, built high-quality railways, which were praised by the National Acceptance Committee.

    This discussion further enhanced everyone's understanding of the great significance and powerful power of emphasizing politics. Everyone unanimously stated that in future construction and revolutionary struggles, they must be unwavering in their belief in emphasizing politics, firm in their implementation, and persistent in their implementation, emphasizing politics at all times and in all places. No matter what situation they encounter, they will take Chairman Mao's books as the highest instruction for all our work, use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, improve everything, and promote everything, and let the great Mao Zedong Thought command our construction teams and stride forward on the road of revolutionization.

    突出政治必须坚信不疑坚定不移坚持不懈
    解放军铁道兵部队党委扩大会议讨论如何正确处理政治与工程的关系，以生动的事实说明：突出政治抓工程是从根本上抓好工程，冲击政治抓工程是从根本上冲垮工程。
    据新华社十九日讯　中国人民解放军铁道兵部队最近召开党委扩大会议，深入学习毛主席关于政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线的论述和林彪同志提出的突出政治的五项原则及全军政治工作会议精神，对如何正确处理政治与工程的关系这一根本问题进行了热烈讨论。来自铁道兵各部队建设工地的人们用切身体会和生动事实说明：政治与工程，是统帅与被统帅的关系，是主从关系。不论在什么时候，什么情况下，都必须突出政治，把政治工作放在第一位，而不能突出工程、技术。他们说：千条万条学习毛主席著作是第一条，千变万变突出政治不能变，千难万难坚持四个第一就不难。
    工程服从政治，才不会迷失方向
    会议认真地批判了“政治要服从工程”和“工程就是政治”等一系列错误观点和模糊认识。会议指出，那种说“修路是铁道兵的基本任务，政治要服从工程”的言论，实质上是“工程第一”的思想在作怪，是颠倒了政治与工程的关系。毛主席一再教导我们：政治是统帅，是灵魂，政治工作是一切工作的生命线。政治与工程，应当是工程服从政治，而不是政治服从工程。如果只强调搞工程，而不突出政治，不把政治工作摆在第一位，不用毛泽东思想武装全体人员的头脑，不但工程任务不可能完成得好，而且还会忘掉敌人，遭受资产阶级思想的侵蚀，在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命中吃败仗。至于说“工程好就是政治好，完成了工程任务就是突出了政治”，“千条万条，两条钢轨铺上是第一条：千好万好，完不成任务什么都不好”，更是毛主席早在古田会议上就批判过的“军事好，政治自然会好，军事不好，政治也不会好”的单纯军事观点的翻版。这些同志不了解，我们所做的一切革命工作虽都从属于无产阶级政治，但它和政治的关系，是局部和全局的关系。工程任务只是我们所要完成的政治任务的一个组成部分，不是政治任务的全部。政治包括更多的内容，更大的范围。如果认为工程具有政治意义，就不需要做政治思想工作了，那是一种曲解。工程任务具有政治意义是一回事，人们懂不懂它的政治意义，在执行任务时有没有觉悟是另一回事。政治工作就是要做提高人们觉悟的工作。说“工程就是政治”，其实质是以工程代替政治，使人们迷失政治方向，走到邪路上去。
    会议指出，突出政治要出物质和精神两个方面的成果。工程等各项任务的完成，仅是一种成果，还有一种更重要的成果，就是要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，从根本上提高指战员的阶级觉悟，保证党对军队的绝对领导，保证指战员永远听毛主席的话，永远跟党走。永远不变质，不出修正主义。他们说，政治对工程的保证，不是一种技术的保证，而是一种政治思想的根本保证。它保证人们处处以毛主席著作为最高指示，把学习毛泽东思想的空气搞得浓浓的，把无产阶级觉悟提得高高的，把士气鼓得足足的，把团结搞得好好的，把对敌人的仇恨搞得深深的，不管执行什么艰巨任务，都能无往而不胜。
    突出政治才能排除万难，胜利前进
    在党委扩大会议上，来自各部队的领导人和政治工作人员还交流了正确处理政治与工程的关系的经验和体会。不少来自施工第一线的指战员谈到，铁道兵部队大部分长年累月在偏僻地区施工，环境艰险，劳动紧张，生活艰苦。只有突出政治，用毛泽东思想武装大家的头脑，使干部战士树立起为革命修路的思想，才能做到险山恶水吓不倒，生活艰苦拖不倒，压倒一切困难，胜利前进。来自山区工地的某部队人员说，他们的部队初到工区时，一无住房，二无道路，三无足够水源。面对着这样艰苦的环境，部队领导狠抓突出政治，把活学活用毛主席著作摆在首位，针对当时有的人怕苦畏难的活思想进行讨论。工地上，到处挂着毛主席语录牌，战士们是“抬头见语录，低头想语录，上工带语录，干活用语录。”干部则是“主席语录随身带，喇叭筒子手上拐，见缝插针说一段，好人好事讲起来。”毛主席的教导和活跃的政治思想工作，使战士们进一步明确了为什么要施工和为谁施工，明确了怎样对待艰苦，他们说：“山再高，没有铁道兵志气高；岩再坚，没有铁道兵意志坚；石再硬，没有铁道兵骨头硬。”施工中，大家意气风发，干劲冲天，战胜了困难，改变了环境，不断创造了出色的成绩。来自东北林区施工部队的同志也说，他们施工的林区，解放前一向被人称为“高寒禁区”。他们部队开入前，党委首先抓了政治，部队上上下下学“三篇”（《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》），抓“三比”（与红军比艰苦、比斗志、比贡献），树“三荣”（劳动为荣、艰苦为荣、当铁道兵为荣）。干部战士革命精神大振，以敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神，闯进了“禁区”，与恶劣的自然环境展开搏斗。没有房子住，撬开冰雪，架起帐篷；没有水喝，就化雪水；白菜冻得象铁石，刀切不开就用斧头砍。部队还打破常规在这原始林区开展了冬季施工，提前完成了年度工程任务。
    会议上，某部队同志还以某团二营施工中突出政治和不突出政治的经过，说明突出政治抓工程是从根本上抓好工程；冲击政治抓工程是从根本上冲垮工程。
    政治统帅技术，修出高标准工程
    在谈到政治与技术关系问题时，不少同志还以亲身经历说明以政治统帅技术的重要。他们说，单纯抓技术，困难重重，技术上不去，有时即使上去了，也容易把技术看成是个人的“铁饭碗”和骄傲的“本钱”，而不能在施工中充分发挥作用；以政治统帅技术，就能排除万难，加快掌握复杂技术的进度，培养出又红又专的革命接班人。某部队人员说，他们接受某地铁路收尾配套工程，由于工程要求高，技术性强，许多新战士干不了，以至有的工程质量不好，重新返工。这支部队的党组织坚定不移地突出政治，组织大家学习毛主席全心全意为人民服务的教导，讨论“是人掌握技术，还是叫技术把人难住？”经过学习和讨论，大家认识到：我们是毛主席的战士，必须用全心全意为人民服务的思想要求自己，尽最大努力学会施工技术，为革命修筑出高标准的铁路来。在这种思想指导下，战士们自觉苦练过硬本领，很快就比较熟练地掌握了技术，在收尾配套工程中，以高度负责、一丝不苟的精神，修出了高质量的铁路，受到了国家验收委员会的好评。
    这次讨论，进一步提高了大家对突出政治的巨大意义和强大威力的认识。大家一致表示，在今后施工和革命斗争中，对突出政治一定要做到在思想上坚信不疑，在行动中坚定不移，在贯彻时坚持不懈，时时处处突出政治。不论遇到什么情况，都把毛主席的书当作我们各项工作的最高指示，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，改进一切，推动一切，让伟大的毛泽东思想统帅我们施工队伍，在革命化的大道上阔步前进。
