    Three Mu of Cotton Seedlings, a Heartfelt Concern
    Hua Yinyue, Member of the Cixi Commune, Zhejiang

    Team Five of the Dai Family has a lofty style,
    Strongly supporting good cotton seedlings;
    Our team lacked seedlings and received help,
    Planting cotton fully and well.
    Speaking of June third,
    Members of our team went to replant seedlings,
    Discovered three mu of pure white earth,
    Immediately felt like boiling oil inside.
    Youding lowered his head and didn't speak,
    Guanzhang scratched his head desperately,
    But Guanfu reminded me:
    "Quickly run to Team Five!"
    I suddenly remembered something,
    Team Five indeed had extra seedlings,
    Before the captain left for a meeting,
    He had discussed it with me.
    I set off to Team Five,
    And expressed my intentions,
    Team Five members were picking beans,
    Hearing we needed seedlings, they smiled:
    "Your team and our team are the same,
    Quickly bring people to dig seedlings."
    Bringing back the good news to the team,
    Every member smiled happily,
    Following me, they walked with a spring in their step,
    Singing songs all the three li way back and forth.
    You dig, I carry, for a whole day,
    Half the white land wore a green robe;
    The next day, fifteen more people went,
    Three mu were covered with new seedlings!
    Looking at ourselves and then at others,
    Team Five's land looked like a honeycomb,
    Full of holes, making work difficult,
    Dropping many beans too.
    I opened my mouth and asked the captain of Team Five,
    How much labor and fertilizer subsidy is needed?
    Who knew the captain of Team Five criticized me,
    "We are not doing it for money,
    Supporting each other, hoping everyone is well,
    If we plant cotton and exceed the target,
    That will be everyone's contribution."
    His words were few, but the affection was deep,
    Selfless help, a lofty style,
    What should our team do?
    Everyone came up with three major points—
    First, send twenty-five jin of fertilizer,
    Second, write an article to publish in the newspaper,
    Third, resolve to learn from Team Five,
    And start a friendly competition.
    The three major things were discussed well,
    Everyone pushed me to be the representative,
    This stumped me, the accountant Hua Yinyue,
    How can I express this immense kindness?

    三亩棉苗一片心
    浙江慈溪社员　华银岳
    戴家五队风格高，
    大力支援好棉苗；
    我队缺苗得帮助，
    棉花种足又种好。
    话说六月是三号，
    我队社员去补苗，
    发现长三亩纯白地，
    立时心如滚油浇。
    友定低头不讲话，
    官章拼命头皮搔，
    还是官夫提醒我：
    “快到五队跑一跑！”
    我忽然想起事一件，
    五队确实有余苗，
    队长出门开会前，
    曾经和我谈论到。
    拔脚就走到五队，
    开口就把来意表，
    五队社员正摘豆，
    一听要苗脸带笑：
    “你队我队都一样，
    快快带人来掘苗。”
    带得喜讯回队里，
    个个社员迷迷笑，
    跟我一路而行步生风，
    来回三里歌满道。
    你掘我挑一整天，
    半块白地披绿袍；
    第二天又去十五个人，
    长三亩满地是新苗！
    看了自己看人家，
    五队地里象蜂巢，
    千疮百孔操作难，
    豆子碰落也不少。
    我开口就问五队长，
    工肥补贴需多少？
    那晓得五队长批了我，
    “我们不是为钞票，
    互相支援望大家好，
    种得棉花超指标，
    就算大家有功劳。”
    他话儿不多情意重，
    无私相助风格高，
    我队到底怎么办？
    大家想出三大条——
    一送肥田粉二十五斤，
    二写稿子去登报，
    三下决心学五队，
    友谊竞赛把战挑。
    三件大事商量好，
    众人推我做代表，
    这倒难住了我会计华银岳，
    这千重情意如何表？
