    The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, by running more than nine hundred schools in various production bases, has cultivated a large number of construction talents for the reclamation area.

    Among the various types of schools established by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, there are more than eight hundred primary schools, with over 128,000 children enrolled. The enrollment rate for school-age children has reached 96%. There are more than seventy full-time middle schools, and thirty-three secondary specialized schools offering programs such as agriculture, animal husbandry, textile, weaving and dyeing, sugar making, power irrigation, nursing, and teacher training. These are semi-agricultural (industrial) and semi-study schools. There are more than 16,000 students enrolled in middle schools. Among the higher education institutions in the reclamation area are Tarim Agricultural Reclamation University, the Corps Agricultural College, and the Corps Medical College, with more than 2,000 students enrolled. Now, from primary school to university, from full-time schools to part-work (farming) part-study schools, an educational network has been formed throughout the entire reclamation area. Over the past ten years, the various schools of the Corps have cultivated more than 10,000 graduates, enriching the military reclamation front with a large number of technical backbone forces. Tens of thousands of veteran soldiers, after studying in various professional training courses, have also become excellent commanders and fighters in production.

    The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps has consistently adhered to and carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle of Nanniwan in running its educational undertakings. When they first entered the Gobi Desert, the desert, and the wilderness with nothing, they built schools simply by digging dugouts and setting up tents while simultaneously reclaiming farmland. With the development of the military reclamation cause, the families of the workers successively came to the reclamation area to settle down. In order to meet the growing demands of the children of the staff and workers to enroll in schools, dilapidated stables, cattle pens, chicken coops, and warehouses were renovated and became school buildings. After great development in production and gradual improvement of conditions, they still maintained the spirit of running schools thriftily. Some schools, with teachers, students, and staff, built simple but practical school buildings by firing bricks, making adobe, and cutting reeds. The largest agricultural college in the reclamation area was established in 1959 using four tents and several mills. The primary schools run by the production companies of the various farms are even more frugal. As long as a room can be squeezed out, some mud tables and benches are built, and a blackboard is placed, the school can be established.

    In the early days of running schools, there was a shortage of teachers. They first transferred the original cultural instructors from the companies to teach. Later, as production developed and more and more schools were established, the various reclamation areas and farms ran their own teacher training classes. Some secondary schools also added teacher training classes, training military reclamation fighters and educated youth with a certain level of education to become primary and secondary school teachers. In addition to the teachers assigned by the state, the colleges and universities also transferred many technical personnel with practical production experience to teach. The entire Corps mainly relied on self-reliance to cultivate a teaching force of more than 7,000 people, basically solving the problem of rapid school development and the inability of teachers to keep up with the needs.

    They also used the spirit of working hard and diligently to overcome the difficulties of lacking teaching equipment. Most schools draw their own teaching charts and make their own teaching aids. The grassland laboratory, which was established by the Corps Agricultural College without spending a penny of state money, is a prominent example. In 1962, when they offered courses in "Grassland Science" and "Forage Production," they had no teaching specimens or objects to use. The teachers traveled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, personally collecting more than 5,000 samples of Xinjiang pasture grasses and pressing them into specimens themselves. They collected 360 kinds of pasture grass seeds and planted them in the pasture experiment field. They transformed a bathroom and borrowed a few tables and cabinets, and a very decent laboratory was born.

    The educational undertakings of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps are run based on the principle of "orienting towards the reclamation area, orienting towards production, and orienting towards the staff and workers." The Tarim Reclamation Area is responsible for establishing a sericulture base, so Tarim Agricultural Reclamation University has established a sericulture major. Xinjiang is a region with severe soil salinization, so the Corps Agricultural College has opened a new course in "Saline-Alkali Land Improvement." In the early days of entrepreneurship, in order to enable this team holding combat weapons to quickly master cultural and production technical knowledge, the Corps, while widely conducting amateur cultural education, also conducted various short-term training courses, learning what to do and supplementing what was lacking, from wasteland reclamation to ditching and watering, from sowing to harvesting, from production to management. Whoever has a skill is used as a teacher; wherever there is good experience, it is summarized and promoted, thereby universally improving the production technical level of the entire army. For more than ten years, this type of short-term training class has never been interrupted, training more than 80,000 person-times of various professional cadres. At present, the technicians, tractor drivers, farm implement handlers, as well as finance and warehouse personnel in the grassroots production units of the entire Corps are mostly trained in these training classes.

    The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps runs all types of schools on production bases. Teachers and students can participate in production and conduct various scientific experiments as soon as they leave the school, which is very conducive to implementing the Party's educational policy, closely combining education with productive labor, and better serving proletarian politics. The teachers and students of the various schools of the Corps have consistently insisted on participating in productive labor, and many schools have achieved self-sufficiency in vegetables and meat, and partial self-sufficiency in grain. Every year during the busy seasons of summer harvest and autumn harvest, schools still have agricultural holidays as usual, with teachers leading students to support the farms in harvesting crops. With production bases to rely on, the various specialized schools are not only convenient for conducting on-site teaching and improving teaching quality, but also able to promptly reflect the advanced production experience of the production units into the teaching, greatly enriching the teaching content. By participating in production, the vast number of teachers and students have gradually cultivated a love for labor and the working people, and their physical fitness has also been universally enhanced.

    The various farms are very concerned about cultivating talents, and actively provide schools with production experiment bases to cooperate with students' internships and teaching. Many teaching equipment of the schools can use the equipment of the farms, without adding new ones. The farms also equip the schools with old workers to serve as advisors on production. Technicians from production teams and workshops often also serve as professional teachers in schools. At present, there are about 200 part-time teachers like this. In addition, local production experts often give technical lessons to the students. In this way, the students can not only practice hard production skills, but also truly study well, closely combining the knowledge in books with production reality.

    The various types of schools run by the Corps often combine with the actual teaching situation, guiding teachers and students to study and apply Chairman Mao's works flexibly, and to learn from outstanding military reclamation fighters. Therefore, many graduates have a relatively high level of political consciousness. Many people are determined to take root in the border areas and ask to work in the most difficult places. They can generally endure hardship and stand hard work in production and work, and strive to study their business, making greater contributions to the agricultural reclamation cause.

    新疆生产建设兵团发扬勤俭办教育精神
    面向垦区　面向生产　兴办学校　培养人才
    新疆生产建设兵团在各个生产基地上兴办的九百多所学校，为垦区培养了大批建设人才。
    新疆生产建设兵团创办的各类学校中，有小学八百多所，入学儿童十二万八千多人，适龄儿童的入学率已达百分之九十六；中等学校有全日制中学七十多所，还有三十三所包括农业、牧业、纺织、织染、制糖、电力排灌、医护、师范等的半农（工）半读中等专业学校。中等学校的在校学生有一万六千多人。垦区的高等学校中有塔里木农垦大学、兵团农学院和兵团医学专科学校等三所，在校学生二千多人。现在，从小学到大学，从全日制学校到半工（农）半读学校，整个垦区内形成了一个教育网。十多年来，兵团各类学校培养的一万多个毕业生，为军垦战线充实了大批技术骨干力量。还有几万名老战士经过各种专业训练班的学习，也已成为生产上的优秀指战员。
    新疆生产建设兵团举办教育事业，一贯坚持和发扬了南泥湾自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神。他们在开始进入一无所有的戈壁、沙漠和荒原时，就一面开荒造田，一面挖地窝、架帐篷，因陋就简地办起了学校。随着军垦事业的发展，职工家属陆续来垦区安家落户。为满足日益增多的职工子弟入学的要求，破旧的马棚、牛圈、鸡舍、库房，经过整修，就成了校舍。在生产获得了大发展，条件逐步改善了以后，他们仍然保持勤俭办学的精神，有些学校师生和职工一起，烧砖、打坯、割芦苇，造起了一座座简陋又实用的校舍。垦区规模最大的农学院，就是在一九五九年利用四顶帐篷、几间磨房办起来的。各农场生产连队办的小学，更是克勤克俭，只要挤出间房子，垒些土桌凳，置块黑板，学校就办起来了。
    办学初期缺少教师，他们先是把连队原来的文化教员调来教书；后来生产发展了，学校越办越多，各垦区和农场就自己办师资训练班。有的中等学校也增设师范班，把有一定文化的军垦战士和知识青年，培养成了中、小学教师。大专学校的师资，除国家分配的以外，他们还抽调了不少有生产实践经验的技术人员来任教。全兵团主要依靠自力更生的办法，培养出一支拥有七千多人的教师队伍，基本上解决了学校发展快、师资赶不上需要的问题。
    他们还用穷干苦干的精神，克服了缺少教学设备的困难。大部分学校都是自己绘制教学挂图，自己制造教学用具。兵团农学院不花国家一文钱办起的草原实验室，是一个突出的例子。一九六二年他们开设“草原学”和“饲料生产”的课程时，需用的教学标本和实物一无所有。教师们走遍天山南北，亲手搜集了五千多种新疆牧草样品，自己压制成了标本；采集了牧草种子三百六十种，种到牧草实验地里。他们把一个卫生间加以改造，借来几张桌子、柜子，一个很象样的实验室就诞生了。
    新疆生产建设兵团的教育事业是本着“面向垦区、面向生产、面向职工”的原则兴办的。塔里木垦区负有建立蚕桑基地的任务，塔里木农垦大学就设立蚕桑专业。新疆是个土地盐碱化严重的地区，兵团农学院就开设了“盐碱地改良”这门新课程。创业初期，为了使这支手执战斗武器的队伍迅速掌握文化和生产技术知识，兵团在广泛举办业余文化教育的同时，还举办各种短期训练班，从开荒造田到开渠放水，从播种到收获，从生产到管理，做什么学什么，缺什么补什么。谁有一技之长，就以谁为师；那里有好经验，就总结推广，从而使全军的生产技术水平，有了普遍提高。十几年来，这种短期训练班从未间断过，培训的各种专业干部达八万多人次。目前全兵团基层生产单位的技术员、拖拉机手、农具手以及财务、保管等人员，大都是这些训练班里培训出来的。
    新疆生产建设兵团把各种类型的学校都办在生产基地上，师生们走出校门，就能参加生产，进行各种科学实验，非常有利于贯彻党的教育方针，使教育与生产劳动密切结合起来，更好地为无产阶级政治服务。兵团各校师生一贯坚持参加生产劳动，许多学校的蔬菜、肉类做到了自给，粮食部分自给。每逢夏收和秋收大忙季节，学校还照例放农忙假，由教师带领学生去支援农场收获庄稼。各专业学校有生产基地为依靠，既便于进行现场教学，提高教学质量，又能够把生产单位的先进生产经验及时反映到教学中来，大大丰富了教学内容。通过参加生产，广大师生逐渐培养起热爱劳动、热爱劳动人民的思想感情，体质也普遍增强了。
    各个农场对于培育人才都很关心，主动给学校解决生产实验基地，配合学生的实习和教学。学校很多教学设备可以利用农场的设备，不用再添置新的。农场还为学校配备老职工给他们在生产上当参谋。生产队和车间的技术员，还经常兼任学校的专业教员。目前，象这样的兼职教员已有二百名左右。此外，当地的生产能手还经常给学生们讲技术课。这样，使学生们既能练出过硬的生产本领，又能真正读好书，把书本上的知识与生产实际密切结合起来。
    兵团举办的各类学校，经常结合教学实际，引导师生活学活用毛主席著作，向优秀的军垦战士学习。因此，许多毕业生的政治思想觉悟较高。许多人立志扎根边疆，并要求到最艰苦的地方去工作。他们在生产和工作中一般都能吃苦耐劳，努力钻研业务，在农垦事业中作出了较大的贡献。　　　（新华社）
