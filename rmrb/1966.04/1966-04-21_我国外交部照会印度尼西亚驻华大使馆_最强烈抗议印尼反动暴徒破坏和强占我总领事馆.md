    China's Foreign Ministry Sends Note to Indonesian Embassy in China
    Strongest Protest Against Indonesian Reactionary Thugs for Destroying and Seizing Our Consulate General
    Solemnly Points Out: This atrocity was deliberately created by the Indonesian government and is another extremely serious step in breaking relations between the two countries; demands the immediate expulsion of the thugs, the return of the Chinese Consulate General, compensation for all losses, and effective guarantees for the future safety of Chinese representative offices.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 21st. Xu Jingwu, Deputy Director of the First Asian Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, summoned Balen Sudadisastra, Chargé d'Affaires ad interim of the Indonesian Embassy in China, this morning and handed him a note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The note lodged the strongest protest with the Indonesian government against the barbaric atrocities of Indonesian reactionary thugs who destroyed and seized the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta. The Chinese government solemnly demands that the Indonesian government immediately take measures to drive away the thugs occupying the Chinese Consulate General, return the Chinese Consulate General, compensate for all losses, and must effectively guarantee the future safety of Chinese representative offices. The full text of the note is as follows:
To the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China:
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China extends its compliments to the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia in China and hereby states the following regarding the barbaric atrocities of Indonesian reactionary thugs who destroyed and seized the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta:
    At 9:15 a.m. on April 19, 1966, approximately three hundred Indonesian right-wing thugs, armed with knives, pistols, and other weapons, led by three police officers, rammed open the gate of the Chinese Consulate General in Jakarta with a truck and rushed into the compound. They declared to the employees guarding the Consulate General: "We are here to take over the Chinese Consulate General on the orders of Commander Amir of the Fifth Military Region. From today onwards, this building belongs to us." They hung a large banner of the so-called "Arif Rahman Hakim Regiment Headquarters" of a right-wing thug organization at the entrance. Then, they smashed open the warehouse of the Consulate General, took out food, ate and drank heartily, and cursed Chinese national leaders and insulted overseas Chinese. They forcibly confined two watchmen employees and their families in two rooms, and then carried out large-scale destruction and arson, burning the equipment and utensils of the Consulate General. They openly tore up the flag of the People's Republic of China and raised the triangular yellow flag of the so-called "United Action Organization of Indonesian University Students" on the Consulate General's flagpole. They looted wantonly, transporting several truckloads of furniture and other property from the Consulate General. The thug leader also ordered that all good things be taken away, leaving nothing behind. On the same day, a large number of thugs stayed in the Consulate General, drinking, making noise, dancing, and singing lewd songs, making a complete spectacle of themselves until dawn. The two watchmen employees and their families were detained until 10:00 a.m. the next day before being released by the thugs.
    During this period, the Chinese Embassy repeatedly made representations and protests to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry and the Fifth Military Region Command. However, the Indonesian government and the army authorities deliberately delayed and avoided dealing with the matter. Now, the thugs are still entrenched in the Chinese Consulate General. Obviously, this atrocity was deliberately created by the Indonesian government. This is another extremely serious step taken by the Indonesian government to break relations between the two countries, following the attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of China by armed forces and thugs on April 15. The Government of the People's Republic of China lodges the strongest protest with the Government of Indonesia against this.
    The Indonesian government's attempt to deny its responsibility for the attack on Chinese representative offices is completely futile. When the Chinese Embassy was attacked on April 15, not only did Indonesian armed forces directly participate, but Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Adam Malik publicly delivered speeches inciting anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese sentiments at an anti-Chinese rally of the perpetrators before the event, and after the event, he met with representatives of the perpetrators and praised them greatly. This time, the right-wing thugs destroyed and seized the Chinese Consulate General, and despite repeated representations by the Chinese Embassy, the Indonesian government has consistently failed to take any measures to stop the thugs from committing violence. The facts are all there, and you cannot deny them.
    While stepping up the destruction of relations between the two countries, the Indonesian government hypocritically says that it is "willing to maintain friendly relations with the People's Republic of China" and "guarantee the safety of the Chinese Embassy and overseas Chinese residing in Indonesia." But the words were hardly out of its mouth when the incident of thugs led by Indonesian police destroying the Chinese Consulate General occurred. This one fact alone proves that the above rhetoric is truly hypocritical to the extreme. For several months, right-wing reactionary forces in Indonesia have attacked Chinese representative offices in Indonesia as many as seventeen times, injuring and shooting dozens of Chinese diplomatic, consular personnel, and journalists, and cruelly persecuting thousands of innocent overseas Chinese. You have already trampled on the most basic norms of international relations and are frantically engaging in anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese activities. How can you still talk about "maintaining friendship" and "guaranteeing safety"? Your anti-Chinese and anti-overseas Chinese crimes cannot be concealed in any way.
    The Chinese government solemnly demands that the Indonesian government immediately take measures to drive away the thugs occupying the Chinese Consulate General, return the Chinese Consulate General, compensate for all losses, and must effectively guarantee the future safety of Chinese representative offices. The Chinese government reserves the right to make further demands after investigating all the relevant circumstances of this incident.
    With the highest respect.

    我国外交部照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆
    最强烈抗议印尼反动暴徒破坏和强占我总领事馆
    严正指出：这次暴行是印度尼西亚政府蓄意制造的，是破裂两国关系的又一极其严重步骤；要求立即赶走暴徒，交还中国总领事馆，赔偿一切损失，切实保障中国代表机构的今后安全。
    新华社二十一日讯　中国外交部第一亚洲司副司长徐净武今天清晨召见印度尼西亚驻华大使馆临时代办巴伦·苏达迪沙斯特拉，交给他一份中国外交部的照会。照会对印度尼西亚反动暴徒破坏和强占中国驻雅加达总领事馆的野蛮暴行，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。中国政府严正要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，赶走强占中国总领事馆的暴徒，交还中国总领事馆，赔偿一切损失，并必须切实保障中国代表机构的今后安全。照会全文如下：印度尼西亚驻华大使馆：
    中华人民共和国外交部向印度尼西亚共和国驻华大使馆致意，并就印度尼西亚反动暴徒破坏和强占中国驻雅加达总领事馆的野蛮暴行，申述如下：
    一九六六年四月十九日上午九时十五分，印度尼西亚右派暴徒约三百人，手持利刀、手枪等凶器，在三名警察官的率领下，用卡车撞开中国驻雅加达总领事馆的大门，冲入院内。他们向看管总领事馆的雇员宣称：“我们是奉第五军区司令阿米尔伯伯的命令来接管中国总领事馆的。从今天起，这座房子就是我们的了。”他们在门口挂上右派暴徒团体的所谓“阿里夫·拉赫曼哈基姆团司令部”大横幅。接着，就砸开总领事馆的仓库，拿出食品，大吃大喝，并且破口大骂中国国家领导人，辱骂华侨。他们把两名看守雇员和他们的家属强行禁闭在两间房子里，随即大肆进行破坏、纵火焚烧总领事馆的设备和用具。他们公然撕碎中华人民共和国国旗，并在总领事馆的旗杆上升起所谓“印度尼西亚大学生统一行动组织”的三角黄旗。他们恣意抢掠，把总领事馆的家具等财物运走了数卡车。暴徒头目还下命令，叫把一切好东西都抢走，一点也不要留下。当日夜间，大批暴徒就住在总领事馆，并在馆内酗酒打闹、跳摇摆舞、唱淫荡歌曲，丑态百出，一直闹到天明。总领事馆的两名看守雇员及其家属，被关押到第二天上午十时，才被暴徒释放。
    在此期间，中国大使馆向印度尼西亚外交部和第五军区司令部一再提出交涉和抗议。但是，印度尼西亚政府和陆军当局一直故意拖延，躲避处理。现在，暴徒们仍盘踞在中国总领事馆内。显然，这次暴行是印度尼西亚政府蓄意制造的。这是印度尼西亚政府，继四月十五日组织武装部队和暴徒袭击中华人民共和国大使馆之后，为破裂两国关系所采取的又一极其严重步骤。对此，中华人民共和国政府向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    印度尼西亚政府企图抵赖袭击中国代表机构的罪责，是完全徒劳的。四月十五日中国大使馆遭到袭击时，不仅有印度尼西亚武装部队直接参加，而且印度尼西亚副总理兼外交部长阿丹姆·马利克，在事件前，公然向行凶暴徒的反华集会，发表煽动反华排华的讲话，事件后，又接见行凶暴徒代表，大为嘉奖。这次右派暴徒破坏和强占中国总领事馆，虽经中国大使馆一再交涉，印度尼西亚政府始终没有采取任何制止暴徒行凶的措施。事实俱在，你们是抵赖不了的。
    印度尼西亚政府在加紧破坏两国关系的同时，还假惺惺地说什么它“愿意保持同中华人民共和国的友好关系”，“保证中国大使馆和旅居印度尼西亚华侨的安全”，可是在说这些话的唾沫未干，马上发生由印度尼西亚警察率领的暴徒捣毁中国总领事馆的事件。只这一件事实，就证明上述的花言巧语，真是虚伪到了极点。几个月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力袭击中国驻印度尼西亚的代表机构已达十七次之多，打伤和枪伤了数十名中国外交、领事人员和记者，残酷迫害了成千上万的无辜华侨。你们已经践踏了最起码的国际关系准则，疯狂地进行反华排华，还谈得上什么“保持友好”、谈得上什么“保证安全”吗？你们的反华排华罪行是怎样也掩饰不了的。
    中国政府严正要求印度尼西亚政府立即采取措施，赶走强占中国总领事馆的暴徒，交还中国总领事馆，赔偿一切损失，并必须切实保障中国代表机构的今后安全。中国政府保留在查清有关这次事件的全部情况后，提出进一步要求的权利。
    顺致最崇高的敬意。
    中华人民共和国外交部
