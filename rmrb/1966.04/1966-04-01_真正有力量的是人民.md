	The military dictatorship in Ecuador has collapsed under the impact of the Ecuadorian people's brave anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggle. This is a great victory for the Ecuadorian people. It vividly proves that the real power lies with the people, not with imperialism and reactionaries; it is not the people who fear imperialism and reactionaries, but imperialism and reactionaries who fear the people.
	Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out, "The biggest imperialism in the world today is U.S. imperialism, which has its running dogs in many countries. The people supported by imperialism are precisely the people spurned by the broad masses." The clique within the Ecuadorian military dictatorship were precisely a group of U.S. imperialist running dogs spurned by the people. More than two years ago, U.S. imperialism engineered a military coup in Ecuador, supported puppets like Castro Jijón to come to power, and placed more than four million Ecuadorians under fascist dictatorial rule. U.S. imperialism thought that in this way its colonial rule in Ecuador could be consolidated. This, of course, was wishful thinking. As many historical facts have proven, imperialism and reactionaries intensifying their oppression of the people can only promote more intense revolutionary struggles by the people. In the past two years, the Ecuadorian people's anti-U.S. and anti-dictatorship struggle has developed rapidly, recently reaching a new climax. The Jijón regime was swept away by the constantly rising tide of the people's struggle.
	However, the collapse of the Jijón regime does not mean that U.S. imperialism has really retreated. From the attitude of the U.S. government towards the so-called new "civilian government" of Ecuador, it can be seen that the cunning and insidious U.S. imperialism is playing tricks, attempting to change its methods to maintain its ruling position in Ecuador. However, the awakened Ecuadorian people are not so easily deceived. As long as U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are not completely overthrown, the Ecuadorian people's struggle for national independence and democracy will absolutely not stop.

    真正有力量的是人民
    厄瓜多尔军事独裁政权，在人民群众勇猛的反美反独裁斗争的冲击下，宣告垮台了。这是厄瓜多尔人民的一个巨大胜利。它生动地证明了，真正有力量的是人民，而不是帝国主义和反动派；不是人民害怕帝国主义和反动派，而是帝国主义和反动派害怕人民。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出，“当前世界上最大的帝国主义是美帝国主义，在很多国家有它的走狗。帝国主义所支持的人，正是广大人民所唾弃的人。”厄瓜多尔军事独裁政权中的一伙，正是为人民唾弃的一些美帝国主义的走狗。两年多以前，美帝国主义在厄瓜多尔策动军事政变，扶植卡斯特罗·希洪等傀儡上台，把四百多万厄瓜多尔人置于法西斯独裁统治之下。美帝国主义以为，那样一来它在厄瓜多尔的殖民统治就可以巩固了。这当然是妄想。正如许许多多历史事实所证明的那样，帝国主义和反动派加重对人民的压迫，只能促进人民更猛烈的革命斗争。近两年多以来，厄瓜多尔人民反美反独裁的斗争急剧地发展，最近达到了新的高潮。希洪政权就是被人民不断高涨的斗争浪潮冲垮的。
    但是，希洪政权的垮台，绝不意味着美帝国主义真的退却了。从美国政府对所谓厄瓜多尔新的“文人政府”所采取的态度，就可以看得出，老奸巨猾的美帝国主义是在玩弄阴谋诡计，企图改换一种手段来保持它在厄瓜多尔的统治地位。然而，已经觉醒了的厄瓜多尔人民并不是那末容易受欺骗的。只要美帝国主义和它的走狗没有被彻底打倒，厄瓜多尔人民争取民族独立和民主的斗争就绝对不会停止。
