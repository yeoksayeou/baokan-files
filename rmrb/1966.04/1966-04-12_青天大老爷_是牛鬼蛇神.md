    “Qingtian Dalaoye” is a Monstrous Devil
    Good Soldier of a Certain Unit of the PLA, Luo Xianqing
    Who is the “Qingtian Dalaoye” in Comrade Wu Han’s mind? They are right-leaning opportunists who oppose the Party and oppose socialism, monstrous devils who oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Comrade Wu Han’s “Qingtian Dalaoye” is precisely the one who stands diametrically opposed to our broad masses of people. In August 1959, the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party resolutely countered the right-leaning opportunists who viciously slandered and attacked our country's socialism. After the meeting, at the request of the broad masses of people, the Party removed the right-leaning opportunists from their positions, that is, "dismissed" their "officials."
    Comrade Wu Han felt aggrieved for the right-leaning opportunists who were “dismissed” from their posts by the people, inciting them to regroup and fight the Party again. Comrade Wu Han's intentions are extremely malicious.
    Comrade Wu Han’s means of opposing the Party and opposing socialism are very cunning, but they cannot escape the eyes of the revolutionary people. I am a proletarian revolutionary fighter, holding a gun, my heart is with the Party, defending the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and I will never allow Comrade Wu Han to damage a single hair of our Party, and I will never allow Comrade Wu Han to spread anti-Party, anti-socialist poison and play anti-Party, anti-socialist tricks. The devil is one foot tall, but the Dao is ten feet tall. We must recognize Comrade Wu Han’s hideous face and thoroughly criticize his reactionary thoughts.

    “青天大老爷”是牛鬼蛇神
    解放军某部五好战士　罗显卿
    吴晗同志心目中的“青天大老爷”是谁呢？是反党、反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子，是反党、反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神。吴晗同志的“青天大老爷”，恰恰是与我们广大人民群众誓不两立的。在一九五九年八月，党的八届八中全会对恶毒诬蔑和攻击我国社会主义的右倾机会主义分子，给予了坚决的反击。会后，党在广大人民群众的要求之下，撤了右倾机会主义分子的职，也就是说“罢”了他们的“官”。
    吴晗同志为被人民“罢官”而去的右倾机会主义分子打抱不平，煽动他们重整旗鼓，与党再战。吴晗同志的用心是十分恶毒的。
    吴晗同志反党、反社会主义的手段十分狡猾，却逃不脱革命人民的眼睛。我是一个无产阶级的革命战士，手拿枪，心向党，保卫着党中央和毛主席，决不容许吴晗同志损害我党的一根毫毛，决不容许吴晗同志散发反党、反社会主义的毒素，玩弄反党、反社会主义的伎俩。魔高一尺，道高一丈，我们要认清吴晗同志的狰狞面目，彻底批判他的反动思想。
