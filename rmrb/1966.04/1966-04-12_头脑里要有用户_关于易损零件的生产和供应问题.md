    Keep Users in Mind
    ——Regarding the Production and Supply of Wear Parts
    Editor's Note: The issue of wear parts production and supply raised in this reporter's letter is a problem worthy of attention in the current increase production and practice economy movement.
    In many regions and departments, this problem has not been resolved for a long time, for various reasons. However, fundamentally, it is because some leaders in industrial departments and factories have not established the idea of serving users in their work.
    The reporter's letter points out that the reasons for the past shortage of wear parts, from the perspective of industrial management departments, are that they "only manage production and do not manage usage, do not investigate and understand the needs of users, and do not arrange production based on the actual needs of users." From the perspective of factories, they "always feel that producing parts has a small output value and is very troublesome," so they do not actively meet the urgent needs of users.
    For a socialist enterprise, not having users in mind is actually lacking politics. In our country, the relationship between producers and users has never been a purely economic relationship of buying and selling, but a political relationship of jointly building socialism. Who are the "users" of wear parts? Socialist state-owned factories, socialist collective ownership production units. Who suffers from the insufficient supply of wear parts? The state, the socialist cause. Therefore, harming the interests of users actually directly or indirectly harms the interests of the state and harms the interests of the overall revolutionary situation.
    The Beijing industrial departments recently solved the problem of producing wear parts for low-voltage electrical appliances, doing a great service for users. In industrial production, correctly handling the relationship between whole machine production and parts production is a relatively troublesome matter, with many specific issues that require industrial management departments and factories to jointly explore laws, summarize experiences, and gradually solve them in practice. However, the most fundamental thing is to highlight politics. If politics is put in command, some seemingly complex specific problems are actually not difficult to solve. The practice in Beijing is proof of this.
    Investigation
    In the current increase production and practice economy movement, increasing the production and supply of wear parts is an important issue that needs further resolution. If this problem is resolved well, it can save a large number of complete sets of equipment and make fuller use of existing equipment.
    Three months ago, Yan Wenda, Deputy Director of the Beijing Municipal Materials Bureau, came to the Beijing No. 1 General Machinery Factory as a service team member of the local materials department. At that time, the factory was in great need of adding a kind of low-voltage electrical appliance—magnetic starter. Yan Wenda and other service team members found three such devices, only one of which could be used. The other two were broken due to a part called an arc extinguishing cover. Just because of the lack of this ordinary part, these two magnetic starters became waste products.
    In recent years, with the increasing degree of mechanization and electrification of industrial and agricultural production, the demand for low-voltage electrical appliances has been increasing. Although the output of low-voltage electrical appliances has increased many times, it still cannot fully meet the needs. Why is there a phenomenon of waste of whole machines due to lack of parts on the one hand, and supply falling short of demand on the other hand? Yan Wenda and a group of people visited other low-voltage electrical appliance users, manufacturers, and supply stations, and further learned that most domestic electrical appliance factories produce complete sets of low-voltage electrical equipment, and do not produce wear parts in batches. After individual parts are worn out by the user units, they cannot be repaired, and sometimes they have to scrap the entire equipment, or order a new complete set of equipment, and disassemble the wear parts to repair the old equipment. Some user units also want to find ways to make wear parts themselves, but due to the lack of molds, materials, and special equipment, the quality of the parts produced is poor, the cost is high, and they are not easy to use.
    Accounting
    The workers of the Beijing No. 1 Machine Tool Factory calculated an account: If they can obtain sufficient wear parts, they only need to spend more than one thousand yuan throughout the year to repair the existing four hundred magnetic starters, without having to dismantle two hundred new magnetic starters worth more than ten thousand yuan. The workers of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company also proposed after careful calculation that if wear parts are fully supplied, they can reduce the current annual demand for contactors, air switches, limit switches, and other low-voltage electrical appliances from more than one thousand one hundred units to more than five hundred units, saving more than fifty thousand yuan. According to the investigation, 70% of the 350,000 low-voltage electrical appliances required to be added by Beijing enterprises this year are intended for maintenance.
    Paying attention to whole machine production and neglecting the production of wear parts not only wastes national materials and causes some ineffective labor, but also artificially increases the contradiction between production and demand, becoming one of the reasons for the tight supply of low-voltage electrical appliances.
    Reasons
    Why does this phenomenon of only focusing on whole machine production and not focusing on the production of wear parts occur? It is mainly because the relevant leading departments only manage production and do not manage usage, do not investigate and understand the needs of users, and do not arrange production based on the actual needs of users. In previous years, the output of low-voltage electrical appliances was low, and when they were supplied to users, they carried some wear parts as spare parts for maintenance. In recent years, the national economy has developed rapidly, and the demand for low-voltage electrical appliances has become larger and larger. When arranging production, they concentrated their efforts on increasing the output of low-voltage electrical appliances, but the wear parts of low-voltage electrical appliances not only did not increase accordingly, but the wear parts that were originally carried with the whole machine were generally no longer carried. Users do not have enough wear parts to repair the existing whole machine, so they have to order more new whole machines, and as a result, the "demand" for low-voltage electrical appliances is even greater.
    In addition, some production units have not well established the idea of serving users is serving the people, always feel that producing parts has a small output value and is very troublesome, lack of enthusiasm. When they encounter people and letters from users in various places complaining about the lack of wear parts, they do not actively reflect this situation to the higher authorities and seek a thorough solution.
    Methods
    The Beijing Municipal Materials Department has now reported the situation of the investigation to the higher authorities and put forward suggestions such as including the production of wear parts for low-voltage electrical appliances in the national plan, giving priority to arrangements, and fully supplying them, which has been valued by leaders at all levels. The relevant competent authorities have issued notices to various places, specifically arranging the production of wear parts for low-voltage electrical appliances this year as part of this year's national plan. Some of the wear parts produced are shipped with new complete machines for users to repair these new complete machines; some are used as externally supplied parts to maintain existing complete machines.
    At present, the relevant production departments in Beijing are grasping the production of wear parts for low-voltage electrical appliances in accordance with the national plan. The Beijing Municipal Materials Department is also actively organizing the source of wear parts and expanding the repair business of low-voltage electrical appliances. The production problem of wear parts for low-voltage electrical appliances has been initially resolved, but there are still several issues to be implemented, and the ideas of valuing whole machines and neglecting parts, valuing manufacturing and neglecting maintenance, still need to be constantly overcome.
    Enlightenment
    The solution to the problem of low-voltage electrical appliance parts has greatly enlightened people. Cadres and workers in many units in Beijing and other places have pointed out that in recent years, the problem of parts for some mechanical products has been solved relatively well, and users are satisfied. For example, the supply of automobile parts is an example; but this problem still exists to varying degrees in mechanical aspects such as electric meters, thermal instruments, high-voltage electrical appliances, geological instruments, and tractors, and has not been completely resolved. They require the relevant leading departments to classify, investigate, and study the use, production, and management of various easily damaged materials, and dig out the huge potential for increasing production and practicing economy.

### 头脑里要有用户——关于易损零件的生产和供应问题

    头脑里要有用户
    ——关于易损零件的生产和供应问题
    编者按：这封记者来信提出的易损零件的生产供应问题，是当前增产节约运动中很值得注意的一个问题。
    在许多地区和部门，这个问题长期未得解决，有种种原因。但是，从根本上说，是由于有些工业部门和工厂企业的负责人，还没有在自己的工作中，确立起为用户服务的思想。
    记者来信指出，过去造成易损零件供应不足的原因，从工业管理部门来说，是“只管生产，不管使用，不调查了解用户的需要，从用户的实际需要出发来安排生产”。从工厂企业来说，是“总觉得生产零件产值小，很麻烦”，因此对用户的迫切要求也就不去积极满足。
    对一个社会主义企业来说，头脑里没有用户，实际上就是没有政治。在我们国家里，生产者和用户的关系，从来不是单纯做买卖的经济关系，而是共同建设社会主义的政治关系。谁是易损零件的“用户”？社会主义国营工厂，社会主义集体所有制生产单位。易损零件供应不足给谁带来了损失？给国家、给社会主义事业带来了损失。所以损害了用户的利益，实际上都是直接间接地损害了国家的利益，损害了革命全局的利益。
    北京市工业部门最近解决了低压电器易损零件的生产问题，为用户办了一件大好事。在工业生产中，正确处理好整机生产和零件生产的关系，是一件比较麻烦的事情，有许多具体问题，需要工业管理部门和工厂企业共同在实践中摸索规律，总结经验，逐步解决。但是，最根本的还是要突出政治，政治挂帅了，一些看来复杂的具体问题，其实是不难解决的，北京市的实践就是证明。
    调查
    在当前的增产节约运动中，增加易损零件的生产和供应，是需要进一步解决的重要问题，这个问题解决得好，可以节约大批的整台设备，并使现有的设备得到更充分的利用。
    三个月以前，北京市物资局副局长阎文达作为当地物资部门的一名服务队员，来到北京第一通用机械厂驻厂服务。当时厂里生产上很需要添置一种低压电器——磁力启动器。阎文达和其他服务队员找来了三台这种设备，其中只有一台能用，另外两台都坏了一个叫做灭弧罩的零件，仅仅由于缺少这个普通零件，这两台磁力启动器成了废品。
    近几年来，随着工农业生产机械化电气化程度的提高，低压电器的需要量不断增加。低压电器产量虽在成倍增长，仍然不能完全满足需要。为什么一方面供不应求，一方面却存在着缺少配件就报废整机的浪费现象呢？阎文达带着一批人又访问了其他一些低压电器使用厂、生产厂和供应站，进一步了解到，原来国内电器厂大都生产整台低压电器设备，没有成批生产易损零件，使用单位用坏个别零件以后修复不了，有时不得不把整台设备报废，或定购整台的新设备，拆下易损零件来维修旧设备。有的使用单位也想自己设法配制易损零件，由于缺乏模具、材料和专用设备，做出来的零件质量差、成本高，不好用。
    算账
    北京第一机床厂职工算了一笔账：他们如果能够获得充分的易损零件，全年只要花一千多元，就可以维修好现有的四百多台磁力启动器，不需要拆毁价值一万多元的二百多台新的磁力启动器。石景山钢铁公司职工在算细账后也提出，如果充分供应易损零件，他们就可以使目前全年需要的接触器、空气开关、限位开关等几种低压电器，由一千一百多台减少到五百多台，节约资金五万多元。据调查，今年北京各企业要求添置的三十五万台件低压电器，打算用于维修的，就占订购数的百分之七十。
    重视整机生产、忽视易损零件生产，不但浪费了国家的物资，造成一部分无效劳动，而且人为地增加了生产和需要之间的矛盾，成为低压电器供应紧张的一个原因。
    原因
    为什么会产生这种只抓整机生产不抓易损零件生产的现象呢？主要是由于有关领导部门只管生产，不管使用，不调查了解用户的需要，从用户的实际需要出发来安排生产。前些年，低压电器产量低，出厂供应用户时，都随机携带一些易损零件作为维修用的备件。近几年来，国民经济迅速发展，低压电器的需要量越来越大，在安排生产时就集中力量增产低压电器，而低压电器易损零件不但没有相应增长，原来随整机携带出厂的易损零件一般也不再携带了。用户没有足够的易损零件来维修现有的整机，只好订购更多的新整机，结果低压电器的“需要量”就更大了。
    另外，有些生产单位没有很好树立为用户服务就是为人民服务的思想，总觉得生产零件产值小、很麻烦，缺乏积极性，遇到各地用户来人来信申诉缺少易损零件，却不积极把这种情况向上级反映，求得彻底解决。
    办法
    北京市物资部门现在已经向上级反映了调查的情况，提出了将低压电器易损零件生产纳入国家计划、优先安排、充分供应等建议，受到各级领导部门的重视。有关主管部门已向各地发出通知，具体安排了今年低压电器易损零件的生产，作为今年国家计划的组成部分。生产出来的易损零件，一部分随新整机出厂，供用户维修这些新整机；一部分作为外供件，用来维护现有的整机。
    目前北京市有关生产部门，正根据国家计划安排，狠抓低压电器易损零件生产。北京市物资部门也在积极组织易损零件货源，扩大低压电器修理业务。现在低压电器易损零件的生产问题已初步得到解决，但是还有几个问题有待落实，重整机轻零件、重制造轻维修的思想，还需要不断克服。
    启发
    低压电器零件问题的解决，使人们受到很大启发。北京和外地许多单位的干部和工人们提出，近年来，某些机械产品零件问题是解决得比较好的，用户是满意的，例如汽车零件的供应就是个例子；但是这个问题，在电表、热工仪表、高压电器、地质仪器、拖拉机等机械方面，还不同程度地存在着，没有彻底解决。他们要求有关领导部门分类调查研究各种易损物资的使用、生产、经营问题，从中挖出增产节约的巨大潜力。                  本报记者　徐人仲　余辉音
