    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "As long as we rely on the people, firmly believe that the creative power of the masses is inexhaustible, and therefore trust the people, and integrate ourselves with the people, then any difficulty can be overcome, and any enemy cannot overwhelm us, but will only be overwhelmed by us."
    The completion of the Red Flag Canal in Lin County, Henan Province, once again proves the brilliance and correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's assertion. Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and fully mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people are not only the decisive factors for us to win the victory of the people's revolutionary war, but also the decisive factors for us to win the victory of socialist construction. Emphasizing politics and carrying out socialist economic construction, the Red Flag Canal is a shining example.
    Splitting Taihang Mountain and building the Red Flag Canal is a bold initiative by the people of Lin County in their struggle to transform the old rivers and mountains of Lin County, and a decisive battle to fundamentally change the natural landscape of Lin County. Lin County is located at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains, and is a dry mountainous area with a shocking degree of water shortage. Historically, the people of Lin County have escaped famine more than once, and have also escaped water shortage more than once. Since liberation, the Lin County Party Committee has led the masses in large-scale water conservancy construction, but due to the lack of sufficient water sources in the county, the problem of water shortage has not been completely solved. Introducing the Zhang River water from Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, can greatly solve the problem of water shortage and accelerate the socialist construction of Lin County.
    However, is it possible to bring the Zhang River water from Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, to Lin County? Carving channels on more than fifty cliffs where people cannot stand, cutting off more than two hundred and forty mountain tops, and crossing more than two hundred and seventy ditches and rivers, such a difficult project is unheard of by the people of Lin County. In the first few years of building the Red Flag Canal, Lin County and our country were facing difficult times due to continuous natural disasters, with a lack of funds, materials, and even simple tools such as steel drills, pickaxes, carrying baskets, and carrying poles. Faced with so many difficulties, dare we take on such a heavy burden? This is a severe test for the people of Lin County, and even more so for the Lin County Party Committee.
    The Lin County Party Committee deserves to be the Marxist-Leninist leading core of the whole county, and actively and consciously accepted this severe test. The Lin County Party Committee knows that diverting Zhang River water to Lin County is an urgent requirement of the people of Lin County; the results of the on-site investigation show that although the project is very difficult, it is entirely possible to do so. The Lin County Party Committee understands that doing things that the majority of the masses urgently need will definitely win their support; fully relying on the power of the masses to do these things will definitely be successful. It is precisely this infinite loyalty to the cause of socialism and communism, and the high concern for the interests of the people, that made the Lin County Party Committee dare to disregard the criticism and opposition of some people, and resolutely took on this heavy burden in the most difficult times, and persevered in the struggle to transform nature to the end.
    The idea of serving the people wholeheartedly is consistent with the view of highly believing in the creative power of the masses. The Lin County Party Committee did not underestimate the difficulty of building this canal. However, they firmly believed that as long as the masses are fully mobilized, so that the people of the whole county understand for whom the canal is built and why the canal is built, work together with one heart and one mind, and struggle hard, even the greatest difficulties can be overcome. The Lin County Party Committee has always attached importance to grasping class struggle, doing people's work, and arranging the lives of the masses. Over the past few years, cadres and migrant workers at the Red Flag Canal construction site have persisted in studying Comrade Mao Zedong's works and have persisted in implementing the system of cadres participating in labor. Cadres are truly integrated with migrant workers, and cadres and the masses are truly united as one. Wherever the project is the most difficult and dangerous, the responsible cadres of the construction site command headquarters will take the lead in participating in labor. All issues related to the lives of migrant workers that can be resolved are resolved in a timely manner with the most responsible spirit. The Red Flag Canal is an artificial Tianhe (Heavenly River) carefully built by the people of Lin County on the Taihang Mountains under the leadership of our Party. Here, we once again see the role of the human factor first.
    For the construction of such a great project as the Red Flag Canal, the state provides strong support to the extent possible; the Party organization and the broad masses of the people in Pingshun County provide necessary assistance in all aspects. The superiority of our country's socialist system is fully demonstrated here. Of course, in this great project, the heroic people of Lin County play a decisive role. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively and firmly implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, and finally overcome numerous difficulties and achieve the great victory of building the Red Flag Canal in a faster, better, and more economical way.
    What attitude should we take towards socialist economic construction? Should we emphasize politics and give full play to the role of people, or should we neglect politics and emphasize the role of things and technology? The people of Lin County answered with the most powerful practice. If every place and every unit in the country can be like the people of Lin County, dare to struggle, be good at struggle, emphasize politics, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the people, the face of our country will inevitably be changed more quickly.
    We congratulate the people of Lin County on their great victory in this struggle to change the world, and wish them new and greater victories in continuing to complete the supporting projects of the Red Flag Canal, in continuing to transform the landscape of Lin County, and in the struggle to build a new socialist mountainous area!

### 人民群众有无限的创造力

专栏：社论

    人民群众有无限的创造力
    毛泽东同志说过：“只要我们依靠人民，坚决地相信人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，因而信任人民，和人民打成一片，那就任何困难也能克服，任何敌人也不能压倒我们，而只会被我们所压倒。”
    河南林县红旗渠的建成，又一次证明了毛泽东同志的这个论断的英明和正确。相信群众，依靠群众，充分发挥人民群众的革命积极性，不但是我们取得人民革命战争胜利的决定性因素，同样是我们取得社会主义建设胜利的决定性因素。突出政治，进行社会主义经济建设，红旗渠是一个光辉的榜样。
    劈开太行山，修建红旗渠，这是林县人民在改造林县旧河山的斗争中的一个大胆的创举，是从根本上改变林县自然面貌的有决定意义的一战。林县位于太行山东麓，是一个干旱山区，缺水到了惊人的程度。历史上，林县人民不止一次地逃过粮荒，也不止一次地逃过水荒。解放以来，林县县委已经领导群众进行了大规模的水利建设，但是由于县境内缺乏充足的水源，缺水的问题还没有彻底解决。从山西平顺县引来漳河水，就能够在很大程度上解决缺水的问题，就能够加快林县的社会主义建设。
    但是，远从山西平顺县把漳河水引到林县来，能够办得到吗？在五十多处人们无法立足的悬崖绝壁上凿成渠道，斩断二百四十多个山头，跨过二百七十多条沟河，这么艰险的工程，林县人民是闻所未闻的。而修建红旗渠的最初几年，正是林县和我们国家连续遭受自然灾害的困难时期，资金缺乏，物资缺乏，甚至钢钎、镐头、抬筐、抬杠等简单工具也很缺乏。在这许许多多困难面前，敢不敢挑这样重的担子？这是对林县人民的一个严重考验，更是对林县县委的一个严重考验。
    林县县委不愧为全县人民的马克思列宁主义的领导核心，主动地、清醒地接受了这个严重的考验。林县县委知道，引漳入林，这是林县人民的迫切要求；实地勘察的结果表明，虽然工程十分艰险，但是完全可能作到。林县县委懂得，举办大多数群众迫切要求的事情，就一定能够得到他们的拥护；充分依靠群众的力量来办这些事情，就一定能够办成。正是这种对社会主义和共产主义事业的无限忠诚，对人民利益的高度关怀，使得林县县委敢于不顾一些人的责难和反对，毅然决然地在最困难的时候挑起了这副重担子，把改造自然的斗争坚持到底。
    彻底为人民的思想，同高度相信人民群众创造力的观点是一致的。林县县委并没有低估修建这条渠道的困难。但是，他们坚信，只要把群众充分发动起来，使全县群众都懂得为谁修渠，为什么修渠，同心协力，艰苦奋斗，再大的困难也能克服。林县县委一贯重视抓阶级斗争，重视做人的工作，重视安排群众的生活。几年来，红旗渠工地干部和民工一直坚持学习毛泽东同志的著作，一直坚持推行干部参加劳动的制度。干部真正同民工打成一片，干部、群众真正拧成了一股绳。哪里的工程最困难、最危险，工地指挥部的负责干部就到哪里带头参加劳动。有关民工生活上的一切问题，只要能够解决的，都用最负责的精神及时解决。红旗渠是林县人民在我们党领导下，在太行山上精心建造的一条人工天河。在这里，我们再一次看到人的因素第一的作用。
    修建红旗渠这样的伟大工程，国家在可能范围内给予有力的支援；平顺县的党组织和广大人民，从各方面给予必要的赞助。我们国家的社会主义制度优越性，在这里充分表现出来。当然，在这个伟大工程中，英雄的林县人民起着决定的作用。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极地、坚定地执行党的社会主义建设总路线，终于克服了重重困难，取得多快好省地建成红旗渠的伟大胜利。
    用什么态度对待社会主义经济建设，是突出政治，充分发挥人的作用，还是忽视政治，突出物的作用和技术的作用？林县人民用最有力的实践作了回答。全国每个地方、每个单位，如果都能象林县人民那样，敢于斗争，善于斗争，突出政治，充分发挥人民群众的积极性和创造性，我们国家的面貌必然能够更快地改变。
    我们祝贺林县人民在这场改天换地的斗争中取得伟大的胜利，预祝他们在继续完成红旗渠的配套工程，在继续改造林县河山的面貌，在建设社会主义新山区的斗争中，取得新的更加伟大的胜利！
