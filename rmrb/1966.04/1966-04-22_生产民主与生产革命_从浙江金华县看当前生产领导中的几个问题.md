    Production Democracy and Production Revolution
    ——Several Problems in the Current Production Leadership Seen from Jinhua County, Zhejiang

    Located in the relatively barren red and yellow soil hilly area, Jinhua County has seen a very heated production revolution in recent years, with a substantial increase in grain production. In 1965, despite the impact of low temperatures and excessive rainfall, the average yield per mu still reached more than 750 jin, more than double that of the early days of liberation. One-third of the communes in the county have already exceeded the targets set by the "National Agricultural Development Program" for grain production. In this year's spring plowing, cadres and the masses throughout the county are preparing to push the production revolution to a new climax and strive to surpass the "Program" this year.

    Why has the production outlook changed so much in this area with relatively poor natural conditions? How do the leaders at all levels of the county organize a production upsurge and promote the rapid and steady development of production? This is the question we want to explore in this corner of Zhejiang.

            From Bottom to Top and From Top to Bottom

    Here, we found that from the production team and commune to the county and prefectural committees, this year's production leadership has focused relatively on two issues: one is how to better combine leadership and the masses, and the other is how to make the leadership's subjective understanding more in line with the objective reality. These two issues ultimately boil down to how to fully promote democracy, mobilize the production enthusiasm of the masses, and make production faster.

    This year, there is a clear change in the specific approach to leading production here: production plans, targets, etc., are no longer simply issued from top to bottom, but are implemented using a combination of bottom-up and top-down methods. The production team's planting plan, what to plant, how much to plant, how much yield is required, what measures to take, especially technical measures such as reforming the cultivation system and promoting improved varieties, must be discussed and formulated by the grassroots units—the production teams—implemented plot by plot, and then reported upward. In addition to grasping the planting figures of some cash crops according to the state plan, the county, commune, and brigade also have a general plan for other indicators, but do not issue them, and mainly act according to the opinions of the masses, implementing production democracy.

    Implementing production democracy and not issuing certain target figures does not simplify production leadership, but strengthens leadership even more. This year, the Jinhua County Committee put forward the following requirements to various production units: adapt to local conditions, proceed from reality, and strive for high yields; fully mobilize the masses, summarize last year's experience, implement this year's plan, and help with ideas and suggestions, but mainly let the masses use their own brains to think of ways to seize high yields. On the surface, these are just a few principles, but in fact they are more specific leadership, which is to specifically point out the correct path for grassroots cadres to lead production: do ideological and political work, grasp investigation and research, summarize experiences and lessons, find gaps and tap potential, and most importantly, grasp living ideas and do the work of people.

    Since the Spring Festival, many communes and teams in Jinhua County have mobilized the masses to discuss this year's production plan according to the requirements put forward by the county committee. Many communes and teams have explored natural laws from the experience of success and failure, and further found ideological gaps from production gaps. This is essentially a mass experience summary and mutual education. Xinshi Commune is one of the best communes in the county in terms of production, and it is also a commune with a better record of promoting democracy. In 1960, due to blindly promoting double-cropping rice, production decreased. The commune Party committee promptly summarized the lessons learned, removed the framework of simply setting targets from top to bottom, and mobilized the masses to be masters of their own affairs to discuss the planting plan. As a result, grain production has exceeded the "Program" year after year. When talking about this experience, the secretary of the commune Party committee said that in the collective economy, the members are most concerned about production, and everyone hopes for high yields. As long as production democracy is implemented, and the masses use their own brains, there are many ways to increase production. Comrade Chen Shuangtian, secretary of the Tangxi Brigade Party Branch of Tangxi Commune, introduced the situation of several production teams discussing the plan. He said that the plan should be based on the actual situation of the local area, and the plan should be realized by the masses, because the masses know best how to adapt to local conditions and are most concerned about the realization of their own production plans. Facts have proved that as long as ideological work is done well for the masses, the arrangements of the masses are always more appropriate, and the indicators can be advanced and reliable, and each indicator has measures to ensure it, and they often put forward many situations and problems that the leadership has not considered. For example, in the arrangement of crops, they not only take care of what people eat, but also consider what pigs eat and what cattle eat.

    Jinhua County has experienced three processes in recent years, from simply setting targets from top to bottom, to making suggestions, and finally to letting the masses discuss and decide on the planting plan themselves. In the past few years, simply stipulating the planting figures of a certain crop from above has caused certain losses to production. The members reflected that "there is only the right to labor, not the right to discuss," and their enthusiasm could not be brought into play. Later, they realized the harm of this practice, but still continued to put forward some figures as suggestions. The county gave them to the commune, and the commune gave them to the brigade in the same way. By doing this, some teams were able to mobilize the masses to implement production democracy; however, some team cadres lacked democratic habits, were afraid of trouble, and were afraid of taking risks. Regardless of whether it was in line with the situation in their own area, they still regarded the suggestions from above as "resolutions" and applied them downward. Therefore, the county committee simply did not issue figures this year, but led the masses to make their own plans. The members reflected that when they are the masters themselves, it is easier to accept the lessons learned from mistakes, and they can continue to move forward better.

    From top to bottom to bottom-up and top-down combination, the difference of one word reflects a fundamental change in leadership thinking. Socialist collective economy cannot be without leadership. Leadership, of course, cannot be without top-down requirements, the question is what to lead. For things like the production team's planting plan, except for what the state must grasp, if the numbers are all allocated from above, it is easy to be subjective and one-sided, and good intentions can turn into bad things. Because the fields are planted by the members, if the farmers themselves do not care about how to farm, the fields cannot be farmed well.

    A comrade said: "The members criticized us for taking on some unnecessary worries, managing too much of what should not be managed, and not grasping the things that should be grasped!" What should be grasped, and what should not be grasped? The county has begun to summarize some experiences, that is: grasp the enthusiasm of people more, make fewer rigid regulations; manage ideological politics more, and grasp specific figures less.

            Promoting Democracy and the Class Line

    Implementing production democracy and listening to the opinions of the masses in farming. The masses have all kinds of opinions, how exactly should different opinions be unified?

    Comrade Chen Shuangtian, secretary of the Tangxi Brigade Party Branch, believes that talking about democratic farming cannot be separated from the Party's class line. Whom to rely on, whom to unite with, and whom to oppose, the cadres must have a clear understanding in their hearts. He said that the poor and lower-middle peasants are most concerned about the collective, and when talking about democracy, the main thing is to listen to them and let them be the masters of their own affairs. For different opinions, as long as a class analysis is made, right and wrong can be distinguished.

    Collective production is full of struggle, and people from different classes and strata always have different opinions. When the Houzhang Brigade of Luobu Commune discussed the production plan, the debate was very fierce. This brigade has developed diversified operations relatively well. Some people saw that the income from sideline production was large, so they advocated grasping less grain production and grasping more production projects with more cash income; others disagreed, thinking that not only should diversified operations be grasped well, but also grain production should be caught up, not only taking care of the small collective, but also taking care of the large collective—the country, so that it meets the requirements of socialist construction. In the end, a basically consistent view was reached, and the production plan was rationally arranged, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery all had new developments.

    Many examples show that when democracy is promoted, there will naturally be different opinions, and sometimes there will be fierce debates. Some debates belong to the struggle between two roads, and some are contradictions between the advanced and the backward. The process of debate is the process of unfolding two ideological struggles. In the process of debate, as long as the cadres closely rely on the poor and lower-middle peasants, they can enable the masses to reach a unified understanding on the basis of adhering to the socialist direction and bring into play their socialist enthusiasm. For example, in some teams whose output exceeded the "Program", some masses believed that "production has reached the top." After education on farming for the revolution, they further formulated advanced plans.

    There is also such a discussion: the masses only have the experience of producing three or four hundred jin per mu, not the experience of producing seven or eight hundred jin per mu, and they are slow to accept new things and are more conservative in their thinking. Therefore, to carry out the production revolution, we can only rely on the cadres.

    When talking about this discussion, Comrade Yu Rulin, secretary of the Linjiang Commune Party Committee, said: In the past, he also thought that the masses were ideologically conservative and not as obedient as the cadres. When analyzed from a class perspective, this view is wrong. The majority of poor and lower-middle peasants are very concerned about the collective cause. For major measures such as reforming the farming system, when they feel unsure, they raise the most questions, and it is also the most difficult to pass their "gate." Therefore, some people think they are "conservative." In fact, this attitude precisely shows their sense of responsibility for the collective cause; as long as they understand that a certain innovation measure is indeed effective, their sense of responsibility will be transformed into the active force for implementing new measures. Therefore, the responsibility of the leaders is: first, to conduct ideological education for the masses, and at the same time, set an example to enlighten the masses to consciously accept. Wangshan Brigade succeeded in trial planting early rice in 1964. Last year, Xu Shizhang, the captain of the Second Production Team, advocated planting more early rice. Some people were not at ease, and the plan could not be settled after repeated discussions. Later, various favorable conditions were put forward, and everyone became more and more clear about the discussion before supporting the captain's proposal. After everyone made up their minds, they actively added measures and cultivated carefully. As a result, the early rice achieved a yield of 600 jin per mu. Together with the late season, it exceeded the "Program" in one year.

    The discussions in many teams have shown that promoting production democracy is not a general matter of the masses being the masters, but in essence, it is to enlighten the poor and lower-middle peasants to consciously farm for the revolution and get up to engage in the production revolution themselves.

        The Determination of the Cadres and the Determination of the Masses

    One of the important features that distinguish socialist large-scale agriculture from small-scale agricultural production is the continuous revolution in production. To be able to achieve continuous revolution in production, the Jinhua County leaders at all levels believe that: we cannot rely solely on the determination of the cadres, but we need the masses to have the determination to combine the determination from top to bottom. How can the masses be determined? Their experience and lessons are: the leadership must set an example and use facts to educate the masses.

    In Jinhua, the promotion of the innovation measure of "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus and nourishing fields with green manure" is a very vivid example. Most of the cultivated land in the Jinhua area is low-yield red and yellow soil hills, the soil is highly acidic, and nitrogen fertilizer is lacking. Green manure crops are a good nitrogen fertilizer, but the farmers here have never had the habit of planting them, and even if they plant some, they do not grow well, and the yield is very low.

    Before 1962, the county committee called on the masses to apply phosphate fertilizer to increase green manure production. At that time, the leadership was very determined and allocated a large amount of phosphate fertilizer from the supply and marketing department to various production teams. However, the masses were unwilling to apply it. Although the cadres talked about the benefits of "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus," the masses still did not believe it and did not want to use it. Some cadres forced the members to use phosphate fertilizer, and the members dealt with it perfunctorily, some only applied it in the fields by the roadside, some piled it up in the fields, and some paved the road. When the masses do not recognize a new reform, forcing them to do it will not achieve good results.

    Since it has been determined that "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus" to increase green manure production is the key to developing agricultural production in the local area, is it possible to let go and ignore it if the masses are unwilling to adopt it for a while? The leading cadres of the Jinhua Prefectural Committee and the Jinhua County Committee examined their work and believed that it was not that the masses were really unwilling to use phosphate fertilizer, but that the leadership's work was not done well and there was no demonstration work. Therefore, the leading cadres personally started to plant experimental fields and set an example for the masses to see.

    In 1962, the responsible comrade of the prefectural committee combined the leadership, the masses, and technical personnel in the Lianhe Brigade of Jinhua County to plant experimental fields of "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus." The responsible comrades of the county committee also established seventeen experimental points in various communes, and then districts and communes established experimental fields of "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus," carrying out demonstration and promotion at all levels, constantly summarizing experience, and widely organizing visits. In that year, the green manure crops that applied phosphate fertilizer yielded about 2,000 jin per mu; those that did not apply phosphate fertilizer yielded only 600 to 700 jin per mu. The broad masses of members personally saw the practical effect of "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus" and mastered the method of "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus," and quickly became interested in phosphate fertilizer. After promotion from one point to multiple points to a large area, in the past two years, "increasing nitrogen with phosphorus" has become a conscious mass movement in the Jinhua area. Now, the sales volume of phosphate fertilizer from the supply and marketing department has increased by sixteen times. The masses call phosphate fertilizer "spiritual fertilizer."

    This specific experience and lesson illustrates a truth: any major reform in agricultural production must be inseparable from the consciousness and willingness of the masses, and must be decided by the masses themselves, and the leadership cannot make decisions on behalf of the masses. Once the masses have an understanding and make their own decisions, it will soon become a mass movement.

        The Trust of the Masses and the Responsibility of the Leadership

    In recent years, the Jinhua County Committee has attached importance to production democracy, paid attention to investigation and research, made the subjective more in line with the objective, and achieved great results in the production revolution. However, the comrades of the county committee said that they sometimes encounter some problems in leading the production revolution.

    Last year, most of the communes in Jinhua County increased production, but nine of the thirteen communes in the mountainous area decreased production, and the problem was with expanding the planting of double-cropping rice.

    The mountainous areas here have always implemented a system of rotation of water and dry land, and the yield is relatively stable. Last year, according to the experience of increasing production by expanding the planting of double-cropping rice in the plains area, the county suggested that various communes in the mountainous area expand the planting of a lot of double-cropping rice. As a result, due to the lack of necessary conditions and encountering low temperatures and rainy weather, production decreased.

    When analyzing the reasons for the decline in production, some comrades believed that half was due to people and half was due to the weather, but the fundamental reason was still due to people. The masses have a responsibility, the leadership has a responsibility, and the main responsibility lies with the leadership.

    Crop growth is affected by climate, and it is common sense that mountainous areas have high mountains, cold water, and low temperatures. Whether double-cropping rice can be planted in mountainous areas must take into account the climatic conditions. However, when the county arranged production at that time, it subjectively hoped that the output in the mountainous areas would increase faster, and placed the hope of increasing production on planting double-cropping rice. Therefore, when publicizing and mobilizing, it added its own subjective wishes, and told the masses more about the benefits of planting double-cropping rice, and less about the shortcomings and possible problems. In a word, it did not tell the masses all kinds of situations truthfully and comprehensively. Although the masses lacked experience in planting double-cropping rice, because they heard a lot about the benefits of planting double-cropping rice, coupled with years of trust in the leadership, they held a "give it a try" mentality and planted more double-cropping rice.

    The lesson of the decline in production of double-cropping rice in some communes in the mountainous area gave all the cadres in the county another lesson. They said: When doing some good things for the masses, and when there are achievements in production and the trust of the masses is obtained, the leaders must be more sober and calm, and must especially cherish the enthusiasm and trust of the masses. The more the masses trust the cadres, the more the cadres must be down-to-earth and conscientious in repeatedly consulting with the masses when encountering problems. Do not draw conclusions lightly if the situation is not clearly understood; do not make decisions hastily if the matter is not certain. For production increase measures, only one aspect should not be mentioned; for expected results, only one possibility should not be mentioned. In short, we must enlighten the masses to comprehensively analyze and compare before making a decision.

    Not long ago, the Jinhua County Committee sent out several working groups to analyze the reasons for the failure of planting double-cropping rice with the masses and cadres in the mountainous area, fully promote democracy, improve ideological understanding, and turn the lessons of failure into beneficial experience, so that this year's production increase plan in the mountainous area has been formulated more realistically and reliably.

    From the perspective of Jinhua, how to develop production democracy with leadership is not just a simple change in leadership methods, but is closely related to improving the socialist consciousness of grassroots cadres and the masses and educating them to farm for the revolution. This requires highlighting politics at all times and in all things, doing political and ideological work for people, and paying special attention to grasping the transformation of the thinking, style, and habits of grassroots cadres. Because they are the backbone and the bridge, they play a major role in implementing the Party's policies and in promoting advanced technical measures. This is a complex process of struggle. However, as long as there is a clearer understanding of this issue, it is possible to accelerate this process. The Jinhua County Committee has initially gained some good experiences in this regard.

    生产民主与生产革命
    ——从浙江金华县看当前生产领导中的几个问题
    位于比较贫瘠的红黄土丘陵地区的金华县，近几年的生产革命闹得很火热，粮食产量大幅度上升。一九六五年在低温多雨的自然灾害影响下，平均亩产仍然达到七百五十多斤，比解放初期增加一倍以上。全县有三分之一的公社，粮食产量已超过“全国农业发展纲要”规定的指标。在今年备耕当中，全县干部和群众准备把生产革命再推到一个高潮，争取今年跨过“纲要”。
    为什么这个自然条件比较差的地区生产面貌改变如此之大呢？县的各级领导是怎样组织生产高潮，促进生产又快又稳地向前发展的呢？这是我们在浙江的这一角所要探索的问题。
            自下而上和自上而下
    在这里，我们发现，从生产大队、公社到县委、地委，今年在生产领导上，比较集中地注意两个问题：一是如何使领导和群众更好地结合，一是如何使领导的主观更加符合客观。这两个问题，归根到底是如何充分发扬民主，调动群众的生产积极性，使生产上得更快些。
    今年，这里领导生产的具体做法有一个明显的改变：生产计划、指标等，不再只是自上而下地下达，而是采取自下而上、上下结合的办法落实。生产队的种植计划，种什么，种多少，产量要求多少，采取什么措施，特别是改革耕作制度和推广优良品种等技术措施，都要由基层单位——生产队发动社员讨论制订，逐丘逐块落实，再向上报。县、公社和大队除了按国家计划掌握一些经济作物的种植数字之外，对其他的指标也大体有个规划，但不下达，主要按群众意见办事，实行生产民主。
    实行生产民主，不下达某些指标数字，并不是简化了生产领导，而是更要加强领导。金华县委今年向各生产单位提出这样的要求：因地制宜，从实际出发，争取高产；充分发动群众，总结上年经验，落实今年计划，领导上帮助出主意、想点子，主要让群众自己动脑筋，想办法，夺高产。看上去这只是几项原则，实际上却是更具体的领导，这就是具体地向基层干部指出领导生产的正确道路：做思想政治工作，抓调查研究，总结经验教训，找差距挖潜力，最重要的是抓活思想，做人的工作。
    春节以来，金华县许多社队根据县委提出的要求，发动群众讨论了今年的生产计划。许多社队从成功和失败的经验中摸索自然规律，从生产差距中进一步找思想差距。这实质上是一次群众性的经验总结和互相教育。新狮公社是全县生产较好的公社之一，也是发扬民主较好的一个公社。一九六○年因盲目推广双季稻减产，公社党委及时总结了经验教训，去掉了单纯自上而下定指标的框框，发动群众当家作主，讨论种植计划，结果，粮食产量连年超过“纲要”。公社党委书记谈到这个经验时说，在集体经济里，社员们对生产最关心，谁都希望高产。只要实行生产民主，由群众自己开动脑筋，增产计划订得好，增产办法多得很。汤溪公社汤溪大队党支部书记陈双田同志介绍了几个生产队讨论计划的情况。他说，计划要建立在当地实际情况的基础上，计划要靠群众来实现，因为群众是最懂得因地制宜的，最关心自己生产计划的实现的。事实证明，只要对群众做好思想工作，群众的安排总是比较恰当的，能做到指标先进而又可靠，每项指标都有措施保证，而且往往提出了领导上考虑不到的许多情况和问题。例如，作物的安排，他们不仅照顾到人有吃的，还考虑到猪有吃的，牛有吃的。
    金华县几年来经历过单纯自上而下定指标，到提建议，直到由群众自己讨论决定种植计划这样三个过程。前几年单纯由上边规定某项作物的种植数字，曾经给生产造成一定损失。社员们反映“光有劳动权，没有商量权”，积极性发挥不出来。后来认识到这种做法的危害，但是还继续提出一些数字作为建议。县提给公社，公社照样提给大队。这样做，有些队能够发动群众实行生产民主；但是有些队的干部缺乏民主习惯，怕麻烦，怕担风险，不管合不合自己地区的情况，仍然把上边的建议当作“决议”往下套。因此，县委今年干脆不下达数字，而是领导群众自己订计划。社员们反映，自己作主，错了也容易接受经验教训，并且能够更好地继续前进。
    从自上而下，到自下而上、上下结合，一字之差反映出领导思想上的一个具有根本意义的转变。社会主义的集体经济，不可能没有领导。领导，当然不能没有自上而下的要求，问题在于领导什么。象生产队的种植计划之类，除了国家必须掌握的以外，如果都由上边来分配数字，就很容易主观片面，好心办成坏事。因为田是社员种的，种田人自己不管怎样种田，田就不能种好。
    一个同志说：“社员批评我们，操了些不必要的心，不该管的管多了，该抓的事反而没抓好！”什么是该抓的，什么是不该抓的？这个县开始总结了一些经验，那就是：多抓人的积极性，少作硬性的规定；多管些思想政治，少抓些具体数字。
            发扬民主和阶级路线
    实行生产民主，种田要听群众的意见。群众有各种各样的意见，究竟怎样把不同的意见统一起来呢？
    汤溪大队党支部书记陈双田同志的体会是：讲民主种田，离不开党的阶级路线。依靠谁，团结谁，反对谁，干部心里要有数。他说，贫下中农最关心集体，讲民主，主要就是要听他们的话，要他们当家作主。对于不同的意见，只要作阶级分析，就能分清是非。
    集体生产中充满着斗争，不同阶级和阶层的人总有不同的意见。罗埠公社后张大队讨论生产计划时，争论就很激烈。这个大队多种经营开展得比较好。有的人看到副业生产收入大，就主张少抓粮食生产，多抓现金收入多的生产项目；有的人不同意，认为既要抓好多种经营，更要抓好粮食生产。两种意见针锋相对。由于干部紧紧依靠贫农下中农，摆事实，讲道理，说明多种经营要继续发展，粮食生产更要赶上，不仅要顾小集体，还要顾大集体——国家，这样才符合社会主义建设的要求。最后，基本上取得了一致的看法，合理地安排了生产计划，农林牧副渔都有了新的发展。
    不少事例说明，发扬民主，自然会有不同的意见，有时还会有激烈的争论。争论有些是属于两条道路的斗争，有些是先进与落后的矛盾，争论的过程就是展开两种思想斗争的过程。在争论的过程中，只要干部紧紧依靠贫农下中农，就能够使群众在坚持社会主义方向的基础上，取得统一的认识，发挥出社会主义积极性。比如某些产量超过“纲要”的队，有些群众认为“生产到顶”了，经过为革命种田的教育，他们就进一步订出了先进的计划。
    还有这样一种议论：群众只有亩产三四百斤的经验，没有亩产七八百斤的经验，接受新事物慢，思想较保守。因此，闹生产革命，只能依靠干部。
    临江公社党委书记喻汝林同志在谈到这种议论时说：过去，自己也认为群众思想保守，不如干部听话。用阶级观点一分析，这种看法是错误的。大多数贫农下中农，很关心集体事业，对于改革耕作制度等重大措施，当他们感到没有把握的时候，提出的问题最多，通过他们这一“关”也最难。因此，有人就认为他们“保守”。实际上，这种态度正是表现了他们对于集体事业的责任感；只要他们了解到某项革新措施的确有效，他们的责任感就会转化为执行新措施的积极力量。因此，领导者的责任是：首先对群众进行思想教育，同时做出样子来，启发群众自觉地接受。枉山大队在一九六四年试种早稻成功，去年，第二生产队队长徐世樟主张多种早稻，有人不放心，经过反复讨论，计划也定不下来。后来摆出了种种有利条件，大家越议越明白，才支持队长的主张。大家拿定了主意，就积极加添措施，精耕细作，结果，早稻获得亩产六百斤的收成。加上晚季，一年超过“纲要”。
    许多队讨论的情况都说明，发扬生产民主，并不是笼统的群众当家，实质上是启发贫下中农为革命种田的自觉，自己起来搞生产革命。
        干部的决心和群众的决心
    社会主义大农业不同于小农生产的重要特点之一，就是生产的不断革命。要能做到生产不断革命，金华县各级领导同志的体会是：不能单靠干部的决心，更需要群众有决心，把上下的决心结合起来。怎样才能使群众有决心？他们的经验教训是：必须由领导作出样子，用事实来教育群众。
    在金华，推广“以磷增氮，绿肥养田”的革新措施，就是一个很鲜明的例子。金华地区大部耕地是红黄土丘陵低产田，土壤酸性重，缺乏氮肥。绿肥作物是很好的氮肥，但是这里的农民历来没有种植的习惯，种一些也种不好，产量很低。
    一九六二年以前，县委号召群众施用磷肥增产绿肥。当时，领导决心很大，由供销部门调拨了大量磷肥分配给各生产队。可是群众不肯施用。尽管干部说尽了“以磷增氮”的好处，群众还是不相信，不想用。有些干部硬叫社员用磷肥，社员应付了事，有的只施在路边田里，有的成堆倒在田里，有的铺了路。当群众对一件新的改革没有认识的时候，勉强他们去做，是不会收到好效果的。
    既然看准了“以磷增氮”增产绿肥是本地发展农业生产的关键问题，群众一时不愿意采用，是否可以就此放手不管呢？金华地委和金华县委的领导干部，检查了自己的工作，认为不是群众真的不愿意用磷肥，而是领导工作没有做好，没有示范工作。于是，领导干部亲自动手种试验田，做出样子来给群众看。
    一九六二年，地委负责同志在金华县的联合大队，实行领导、群众、技术人员三结合，种“以磷增氮”的试验田。县委负责同志也在各公社建立了十七个试验点，接着区、公社都建立了“以磷增氮”试验田，层层进行示范推广，不断总结经验，广泛组织参观。这一年，施用磷肥的绿肥作物，亩产达到二千斤左右；没有施用磷肥的，亩产只有六、七百斤。广大社员亲眼看到了“以磷增氮”的实际效果，掌握了“以磷增氮”的方法，很快对磷肥发生了兴趣。经过由一点到多点，到大面积推广，近两年来，“以磷增氮”在金华地区已成为自觉的群众运动。现在，供销部门的磷肥销售量猛增十六倍。群众把磷肥叫做“灵肥”了。
    这个具体的经验教训说明了一个真理：任何农业生产上的重大改革要想成功，绝对离不开群众的自觉和自愿，要由群众自己作主，而不能由领导代替群众下决心。一旦群众有了认识，自己下了决心，很快就会成为群众运动。
        群众的信任和领导的责任
    近几年来，金华县委重视生产民主，注意调查研究，使主观比较符合客观，在生产革命上取得了很大的成绩。但是，县委的同志说，他们在领导生产革命中，有时还发生一些问题。
    金华县去年绝大部分公社都增了产，但是山区的十三个公社，有九个减了产，问题出在扩种双季稻上。
    这里的山区一向实行水旱轮作的制度，产量较稳。去年，县里根据平原地区扩种双季稻增产的经验，建议山区各公社扩种了不少双季稻。结果，由于缺乏必要的条件，又遇到了低温多雨的天气而减了产。
    在分析减产原因的时候，有的同志认为，一半在人，一半在天，而根本原因还是在人。群众有责任，领导有责任，而主要的责任在领导。
    农作物生长要受气候的影响，山区山高水冷气温低，这是常识。能不能在山区种双季稻，必须考虑气候的条件。但是，当时县里安排生产的时候，主观上希望山区的产量增长快一点，就把增产的希望放在种双季稻上。因此，在宣传动员的时候，把自己的主观愿望加了进去，向群众讲种双季稻的好处比较多，讲缺点和可能发生的问题比较少。一句话，没有实事求是地、全面地把各种情况都告诉群众。群众虽然缺乏种双季稻的经验，但由于对种双季稻的好处听得多，加上多年来对领导的信任，就抱着“碰碰看”的心理，多种了一些双季稻。
    山区一些公社种双季稻减产的教训，又给全县干部上了一次课。他们说：为群众做了一些好事，在生产上有了成绩、得到群众信任的时候，领导者要更加清醒冷静，要特别珍惜群众的热情和信任。群众越是信任干部，干部就越要踏踏实实、兢兢业业地遇事反复同群众商量。情况没有了解清楚，不轻易下结论；事情没有把握，不草率地作决定。对于增产措施，不能只讲一个方面；对于预期的结果，不能只讲一种可能。总之，要启发群众全面分析比较，再下决心。
    不久以前，金华县委派出了几个工作组，同山区群众和干部一起分析种双季稻失败的原因，充分发扬民主，提高思想认识，把失败的教训变为有益的经验，使今年山区的增产计划订得比较切实可靠了。
    从金华情况看，如何有领导地发扬生产民主，不只是个简单的领导方法的改变，而是同提高基层干部和群众的社会主义觉悟、教育他们为革命种田，有着密切的关系。这就要时时事事突出政治，做人的政治思想工作，特别是要注意抓基层干部思想、作风、习惯的改造。因为他们是骨干、是桥梁，在贯彻执行党的政策，在推广先进技术措施的时候，起着重大的作用。这是个复杂的斗争过程。但是只要对这个问题有了比较清楚的认识，就有可能加速这个过程。金华县委在这方面已经初步取得了一些较好的经验。		　本报记者　李克林　安子贞　伊心恬
