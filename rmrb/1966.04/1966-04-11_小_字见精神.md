    The Spirit Seen in the "Small" Character
    Fengtai Vehicle Depot　Ma Lianzhong
    Although the boiler room of the Fengtai Vehicle Depot is not large, because the workers in this group have recognized the importance of diligence and thrift, they actively sought ways to save a total of 223 tons of coal last year. What is particularly worth mentioning is that 31 tons of coal were accumulated by them, one broomful at a time, every morning from the cracks in the floors of freight cars waiting for repair in the depot.
    The comrades of the Fengtai Vehicle Depot boiler room sweeping up coal dust from the railcars truly demonstrate the spirit seen in the "small" character. Every broomful they sweep up shows their red heart of contributing strength to socialist construction.
    Some comrades do not pay much attention to the "small" character. They always think that the country is large and rich, and it doesn't matter to use a little more material, wasting a little bit here and there, and throw away some small materials casually. In fact, "small" can be transformed into "large." One "small" is inconspicuous, but ten "small," a hundred "small" added together, doesn't the "small" turn into "large"? Sweeping one or two dustpans of coal every day is insignificant, but accumulated over 365 days, it adds up to 31 tons. Shouldn't this "small" attract our attention?
    Trickling streams converge into a river. The Yangtze River is so large because it is formed by the confluence of countless small rivers. The large amount of funds we need to build socialism also requires us to accumulate it cent by cent. If, in addition to actively creating a large amount of wealth for the country in all aspects, we also put effort into the "small" character and pay attention to saving the country's wealth drop by drop, it will speed up the pace of our socialist construction.

    “小”字见精神
    丰台车辆段　马联仲
    丰台车辆段的锅炉房虽然不大，但是，由于这个小组的职工认清了勤俭节约的重要意义，因此，在去年一年里，积极想办法，共节约了煤炭二百二十三吨。特别值得一提的是，其中有三十一吨煤是他们坚持每天早晨到进段待修的货车的车厢地板缝里一笤帚一笤帚地积累下来的。
    丰台车辆段锅炉房的同志扫车厢煤底这件事，真真是“小”字见精神。他们每扫一笤帚，都显示出他们为社会主义建设贡献力量的红心。
    有些同志在“小”字上是不大注意的。他们总认为家大业大，多使一点料，浪费一星半点没什么，把一些小料随手乱扔。其实，“小”是可以变“大”的。一个“小”不起眼，十个“小”、百个“小”加起来，“小”不就转化为大了吗？每天扫一两簸箕煤是微不足道的，但是三百六十五天凑起来，就积累成三十一吨。这个“小”能不引起我们注意吗？
    涓涓流水汇成河。长江之水所以大，是由无数小河汇集而成的。我们建设社会主义的大量资金也需要我们一分一厘地积累。如果我们除了从各方面积极为国家创造大量财富外，在“小”字上也下下功夫，注意给国家节约点滴财富，那将会加快我们的社会主义建设速度。
