	Xinhua News Agency, April 20th – The Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries held a standing council meeting this afternoon. The meeting decided to reorganize the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries into the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (abbreviated as the Foreign Friendship Association).
	The meeting heard a statement by Chu Tunan, President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, regarding the reorganization of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the adjustment of leading members. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that in recent years, due to a significant increase in non-governmental cultural and friendly activities, the structure of the Foreign Cultural Association no longer met the needs of the situation and work. In order to further strengthen the work of China's non-governmental foreign friendship organizations and expand activities for foreign cultural exchange, it was decided to reorganize the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries into the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries (abbreviated as the Foreign Friendship Association).
	The meeting also adopted the charter of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries and elected the president, vice presidents, and secretaries of the Secretariat. The council members of the Foreign Friendship Association have also been newly adjusted through consultations with relevant parties.

    会议还通过了中国人民对外文化友好协会的章程，推选了正、副会长、书记处书记。对外友协的理事经有关方面协商也作了新的调整。
