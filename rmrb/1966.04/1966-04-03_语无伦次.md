    Incoherent
    Johnson announced that the United States would continue to send more troops to South Vietnam. His reason was that in recent weeks, the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces had suffered "serious casualties." This is truly novel logic.
    The real reason is that the American invading troops in Vietnam have recently suffered serious casualties and urgently need reinforcements. The American aggressors are precisely caught in a vicious cycle of the more casualties, the more reinforcements; the more reinforcements, the more casualties. Johnson is obviously dazed by this vicious cycle and therefore incoherent.

    语无伦次
    约翰逊宣布，美国要继续往南越增派军队。他的理由是，最近几周南越人民武装力量遭到“严重的伤亡”。这真是新奇的逻辑。
    真正的原因是侵越美军最近遭到了严重的伤亡，急需补充。美国侵略者正是陷于伤亡越多，增兵越多，增兵越多，伤亡越多的恶性循环之中。约翰逊显然是被这种恶性循环弄得昏头昏脑，因而语无伦次。
