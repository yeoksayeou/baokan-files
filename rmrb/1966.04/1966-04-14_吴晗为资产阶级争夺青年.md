    Wu Han's articles and plays concerning Hai Rui were written between 1959 and 1962. At that time, internationally, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, like a chorus of frogs, clamored anti-China. Domestically, right-leaning opportunists and other monsters and demons also launched a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. It was at this time that Wu Han, along with them, frantically opposed the Party and opposed socialism.
    In "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor," Wu Han attempted to call upon our younger generation to learn Hai Rui's so-called "upright and unyielding" spirit, and "fight the dark forces to the end." His "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" also wants us to sympathize with and support those right-leaning opportunists who were "dismissed" from "office." In short, Wu Han attempted to incite our younger generation to stand on the side of the right-leaning opportunists, and use Hai Rui's spirit of "mocking" the emperor to oppose the Party and oppose socialism. Wu Han, as a spokesperson for the right-leaning opportunists, attempted to contend for the younger generation.
    Our younger generation, under the Party's long-term nurturing, knows what to love and what to hate. Chairman Mao taught us: "There is absolutely no such thing as love without reason, nor is there hate without reason." What kind of class has what kind of love, and what kind of hate. We are the younger generation of the proletariat, we love Chairman Mao, love the Party, and love socialism, and we hate those right-leaning opportunists who attack the Party and attack socialism. This is a matter of great right and wrong, and this right and wrong is very clear among our younger generation.
    I am a youth who grew up under the Party's education. It was the Party's education that turned me from a girl who knew nothing into a youth who understands revolutionary principles. It was the Party's education that made me understand why a person should live, and understand how to live meaningfully. It was the Party's education that enabled me, when Kuomintang bandits came to rob state property, to fight the bandits and defend the property of the socialist state, and defend the interests of the Party. Our younger generation has a dauntless revolutionary spirit, and a spirit of daring to fight the extremely vicious enemies to the end. However, this spirit is by no means the Hai Rui's "spirit of fighting the dark forces to the end" advocated by Wu Han. The "dark forces" that Wu Han speaks of are ulterior motives. He points at the mulberry tree while scolding the locust, scolding our beloved Party and our beloved socialism. We must defend the Party and defend socialism, and fight to the end against Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-socialist activities that attempt to carry out capitalist restoration.
    Wu Han's attempt to contend for the younger generation for the right-leaning opportunists is absolutely impossible. Our younger generation is determined to repel Wu Han's frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. In this serious class struggle in the ideological field, I am determined to redouble my efforts to study Chairman Mao's writings, listen to Chairman Mao's words, resolutely follow Chairman Mao, do what Chairman Mao says, resolutely fight against all words and deeds that violate Mao Zedong Thought, and be a loyal and reliable successor to the Party.

    吴晗为资产阶级争夺青年
    共青团昆明市近日百货商店总支书记　徐学惠
    吴晗的有关海瑞的一些文章和剧本，是在一九五九年到一九六二年期间写的。当时，在国际上，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派象一群青蛙一样，大肆反华叫嚣。在国内，右倾机会主义分子等牛鬼蛇神也向党向社会主义发动了猖狂进攻。就在这个时候，吴晗和他们一道，猖狂的反党反社会主义。
    吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》里，企图号召我们青年一代学习海瑞的所谓“刚直不阿”、“和黑暗势力斗争到底的精神”。他的《海瑞罢官》，又要我们去同情和支持那些被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子。总之，吴晗企图煽动我们青年一代站在右倾机会主义分子一边，以海瑞“骂”皇帝的精神，来反党反社会主义。吴晗作为右倾机会主义分子的代言人，企图争夺青年一代。
    我们青年一代，在党的长期教养下，懂得爱什么，恨什么。毛主席教导我们说：“世上决没有无缘无故的爱，也没有无缘无故的恨。”什么样的阶级就有什么样的爱，就有什么样的恨。我们是无产阶级的青年一代，我们热爱毛主席，热爱党，热爱社会主义，我们恨那些攻击党，攻击社会主义的右倾机会主义分子。这是大是大非的问题，这种是非，在我们青年一代中分辨得十分清楚。
    我是一个在党的教养下成长起来的青年。是党的教养，使我从一个不懂得事的女孩子变成了一个懂得革命道理的青年。是党的教养，使我懂得了一个人为什么要活着，懂得了怎样活着才有意义。是党的教养，使我在国民党匪徒来抢窃国家财产的时候，能够同匪徒搏斗，保卫社会主义国家的财产，保卫党的利益。我们青年一代，有大无畏的革命精神，有敢于同穷凶极恶的敌人斗争到底的精神。但是，这种精神决不是吴晗所提倡的什么海瑞的“和黑暗势力斗争到底的精神”。吴晗所说的“黑暗势力”，是别有用心的。他指桑骂槐，骂我们亲爱的党和我们热爱的社会主义。我们要保卫党保卫社会主义，同吴晗的反党反社会主义、企图搞资本主义复辟的活动斗争到底。
    吴晗企图为右倾机会主义分子争夺青年一代，这是万万办不到的。我们青年一代决心打退吴晗向党向社会主义的猖狂进攻。在意识形态领域里的这场严重的阶级斗争中，我决心加倍努力学习毛主席著作，听毛主席的话，坚决跟着毛主席走。毛主席怎么说我就怎么做，跟一切违反毛主席思想的言行坚决斗争，做党的忠实可靠的接班人。
