    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th Dispatch from Jakarta: Reports from Jakarta by Japan's Kyodo News and Western news agencies reveal the process by which the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique launched a coup and usurped power.
    Kyodo News' Jakarta correspondent, Watanabe, reported on March 13th about Suharto's takeover of power from President Sukarno. The report stated: "President Sukarno handing over actual power to Suharto began with plainclothes troops from an army commando unit sneaking into the Presidential Palace compound during a full cabinet meeting on the 11th and killing the guarding soldiers with knives. On the morning of the 11th, around 11:30 AM, plainclothes troops from the army commando unit threw daggers, killing the guards, and entered the Presidential Palace compound, which was surrounded by units of unclear affiliation (Siliwangi Division) whose unit numbers had been removed. At 11:45 AM, President Sukarno received a warning from the guards stating, 'Units of unclear affiliation have entered; the situation is dangerous.' He interrupted the meeting and, along with First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Subandrio and Third Deputy Prime Minister Saleh, fled to Bogor Palace by helicopter to take refuge."
    The report continued: "Defense Minister Sabini, Greater Jakarta Military Region Commander Amir Machmud, and Basic Industry Minister Mohammad Jusuf, among other generals, followed the president to Bogor in cars to present him with an ultimatum, in effect, that the army was forcing him to hand over power."
    "When the three generals arrived, many students were gathered around Bogor Palace, displaying a menacing presence. Just as the guards were making threatening shots, gunfire came from another direction, followed by fully armed troops of the Siliwangi Division, who demanded that the guards lay down their weapons. The guards were disarmed. Four battalions of the Siliwangi Division completely surrounded Bogor Palace. After disarming the guards, they entered the palace, leaving the president helpless."
    "The three generals met with the president around noon and presented their demands. It is said that President Sukarno initially said he wanted to meet with Army Minister Suharto and asked for a delay. The signing took place at 9 PM."
    The report stated: "After hearing the report from the three generals who acted as envoys, the army leaders immediately held a small meeting of the four services (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Police Force) that evening, forcing the other three services to take unified action."
    The report said that prior to the army commando unit taking action, "Army Minister Suharto convened a meeting of army leaders before the scheduled military region commanders' meeting on the 12th, indicating the direction of the action and reporting the meeting's decision to former Defense Minister Nasution."
    The Associated Press also reported on March 12th: "Suharto and the dismissed Defense Minister Nasution, after holding a series of secret meetings in Bandung and Jakarta earlier this month, finally managed to bring all the heads of the armed forces to their side. These included pro-Sukarno generals, such as the new Defense Minister Major General Sabini and Jakarta Garrison Commander Brigadier General Amir Machmud. They issued an ultimatum to Sukarno earlier this week, demanding that he remove Subandrio by Saturday." The report said, "The generals met with Sukarno on Friday (the 11th)…Sukarno now needs to hand over all power to the army. Sukarno finally signed a document shortly before midnight on Friday, handing over these powers to Suharto."
    Reuters reported from Jakarta on March 12th: "This morning (the 12th), President Sukarno, facing growing student unrest and army opposition, entrusted his life and power to Army Chief Lieutenant General Suharto." The report stated that last night (March 11th), "Many army leaders spoke with President Sukarno until dawn. At the same time, paratrooper commandos and elite troops of the Siliwangi Division took advantage of the curfew to enter the city and occupy positions."
    Kyodo News' Jakarta correspondent, Watanabe, reported on March 19th about the Indonesian right-wing generals' group arresting President Sukarno's cabinet ministers and reorganizing the cabinet. The report stated that Sukarno's statement "issued on the 16th through former Third Deputy Prime Minister Saleh, which deviated from the principles of understanding reached with the military, seemed to have deeply angered the military and instead consolidated their unity. For President Sukarno, it became the final act of resistance."
    On March 16th, President Sukarno issued a statement through Third Deputy Prime Minister Harul Saleh, expressing "great regret" that "some members of society are attempting to impose their opinions regarding the president's staff, even using ultimata, on the president." He announced that as the appointee of the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly, he "can only be responsible to the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly and the Almighty God." He has "full freedom to appoint his staff." Suharto also issued a statement on March 16th, denying that he had taken over state power from President Sukarno and falsely claiming that Sukarno "still exercises the powers of the head of state."
    However, this Kyodo News report from March 19th stated, "The military was not shaken at all by the president's unexpected statement on the 16th." "Army Propaganda Chief Subroto, in order to prevent the leftists from making a comeback, ordered newspapers and broadcasting organs to be placed under direct surveillance that evening, and Army Minister Suharto ordered the arrest of Subandrio…The arrests were carried out at 4:30 AM on the 18th. Most of the arrested ministers were hiding in the president's guesthouse. The president left for Bogor by car under the escort of the guards on the morning of the 18th." The report stated that starting from midnight on March 17th, about 3,000 troops, including armored units, armored vehicle convoys, and the Siliwangi Division, surrounded the Presidential Palace. By 10:00 AM on March 18th, some of these troops remained, while the rest returned to their camps.
    The report stated, "What is noteworthy in this exercise of power by the military is that they gave careful consideration: arresting ministers but not harming President Sukarno. The military's policy is to always protect the president. This is probably based on the judgment that preserving the president, who still enjoys widespread support among the people, is beneficial, even if the pace of normalization is somewhat slowed."
    Kyodo News' Jakarta correspondents Watanabe and Fujii reported on March 28th about the announcement of the new cabinet on March 27th. The report stated: "The Indonesian political situation has come to an end with the cabinet reshuffle on the 27th. In name, it is a cabinet reshuffle, but in substance, it is the establishment of a new type of cabinet, which can also be said to be a cabinet that institutionalizes the Nasution-Suharto military leadership system."
    The report stated: "President Sukarno, who is in fact already bound hand and foot, can only move towards becoming a 'symbol.' It is expected that Deputy Prime Ministers Suharto, Malik, and Sultan Hamengkubuwono, as well as the Presidium controlled by General Nasution behind them, will gradually expand the scope of 'ordinary powers' and gradually eliminate President Sukarno's right to speak."
    The report stated: "In this process, resistance from President Sukarno may be encountered, and there may be some setbacks, but it is fundamentally inconceivable that the current system will be overthrown. Although General Nasution will only serve as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Crush Malaysia Command at the ministerial level in this cabinet reshuffle…it is expected that he will soon come to the forefront of the political stage."
    The report stated that the new cabinet is facing diplomatic and economic problems. "Particularly serious is how to rebuild the Indonesian economy, which is facing bankruptcy. Therefore, it will be necessary to rely on emergency aid from foreign countries first." It is expected that Nasution will "re-examine relations with the Soviet Union" and, on the other hand, "gradually adopt a policy of approaching the West."

    苏哈托是怎样使用武力篡夺政权的？
    日本共同社和西方通讯社报道印度尼西亚右派将领发动政变经过
    新华社四日讯　雅加达消息：日本共同社和西方通讯社从雅加达发出的报道，透露了印度尼西亚右派将领集团发动政变、篡夺政权的经过。
    共同社驻雅加达记者渡边三月十三日报道了苏哈托从苏加诺总统手中接管政权的经过。报道说：“苏加诺总统把实权交给苏哈托，是以陆军突击团的便衣部队十一日潜入正在举行内阁全体会议的总统官邸院内、掷刀杀死担任警卫的卫队士兵开始的。陆军突击团的便衣部队十一日上午十一时半左右，投掷短刀杀死卫兵，进入了总统官邸院内，官邸周围被取去部队番号的隶属不明的部队（西利万吉师）包围了。在十一时四十五分，苏加诺总统收到卫队给他的‘隶属不明的部队进来了，形势危险’的警报后，中途退席，同第一副总理兼外长苏班德里约、第三副总理萨勒乘直升飞机去茂物宫避难。”
    报道说：“国防部长萨比尼、大雅加达军区司令阿密尔·马哈茂德、基本工业部长穆罕默德·优素福等三将军为了向总统提出陆军逼迫他交出权力的事实上的最后通牒，紧接着乘汽车追赶去茂物的总统。”
    “三将军到达时，茂物宫周围聚集了许多学生，气势汹汹。卫队刚进行威胁性射击，就从另外的方向传来了枪声，紧接着出现了全副武装的西利万吉师的队伍，他们要求卫队放下武器，卫队就被解除了武装。西利万吉师的四个营的兵力完全包围了茂物宫，在解除卫队的武装以后，进入了宫内，因此总统也无能为力了。”
      “三位将军在中午时分会见总统，提出要求书。据说，苏加诺总统最初说要会见陆军部长苏哈托，要求放缓时间限制。签署是在晚上九时进行的。”
    报道说：“陆军领导人在听了作为使者的三位将军的汇报后，在当天晚上立即召开四军（陆、海、空军和警察部队）小型会议，逼迫其他三军采取统一行动。”
    报道说：在陆军突击团采取行动前，“苏哈托陆军部长在预定在十二日举行的军区司令会议前夕召开陆军领导人会议，表明采取行动的方针，并且向前国防部长纳苏蒂安报告了会议的决定。”
    美联社三月十二日也报道说：“苏哈托和被撤职的国防部长纳苏蒂安于本月初在万隆和雅加达举行了一系列秘密会议之后，终于设法把武装部队的所有首脑拉到他们这一边。这些人中包括亲苏加诺的将军们，如新国防部长萨比尼少将和雅加达卫戍司令阿密尔·马哈茂德准将。他们在本周初向苏加诺发出一项最后通牒，叫他在星期六以前除掉苏班德里约。”报道说：“将军们星期五（十一日）傍晚会见了苏加诺，……苏加诺现在需要把所有的权力交给陆军。苏加诺最后在星期五午夜前不久签署了一个文件，把这些权力交给了苏哈托。”
    路透社三月十二日从雅加达报道说：“今天（十二日）清晨苏加诺总统在面临愈来愈增长的学生骚乱和陆军反对的情况下，把自己的生命和权力托付给陆军首脑苏哈托中将”。报道说，昨天（三月十一日）晚间，“许多陆军领导人同苏加诺总统谈到凌晨。与此同时，伞兵突击队和西利万吉师的精锐部队趁着宵禁时开入这个城市占据阵地。”
    共同社驻雅加达记者渡边三月十九日报道了印度尼西亚右派将领集团逮捕苏加诺总统的内阁部长和改组内阁的经过。报道说，苏加诺总统“十六日通过前第三副总理萨勒发表的苏加诺声明，是脱离了同军方达成谅解的原则的片面的东西，好象深深地激怒了军方，反而巩固了军方的团结，对于苏加诺总统来说，则成了最后的一次反抗。”
    三月十六日，苏加诺总统通过第三副总理哈鲁尔·萨勒发表声明，对“有一些社会人士企图把自己关于总统助手班子的意见甚至采用最后通牒的方式强加于总统”，表示“非常遗憾”。他宣布作为临时人民协商会议的委任者，他“只能对临时人民协商会议和万能的真主负责”，他“有充分的自由来指定他的助手”。苏哈托在三月十六日也发表声明，否认他从苏加诺总统手中接管了国家权力，并且伪称：苏加诺“仍然行使国家元首的权力”。
    但是，共同社三月十九日的这篇报道说，“军方根本没有因为总统十六日出乎意外地发表声明而动摇”，“陆军宣传处长苏布罗托为了堵住左派卷土重来，在当天晚间下令把报纸和广播机关置于直接监视之下，苏哈托陆军部长则下令逮捕苏班德里约。……逮捕是在十八日清晨四时半实行的，被捕的部长多数躲在总统的迎宾馆里。总统则在十八日早晨在卫队的护卫下坐汽车去茂物了。”报道说，从三月十七日半夜起包围总统府的装甲部队、装甲车队和西利万吉师等部队大约有三千人。到三月十八日上午十时以后，这些部队留下一部分，其余的都撤回营地了。
    报道说，“在这次军方行使实力的过程中值得注意的是，军方作了周密的考虑：逮捕部长，却又不伤害苏加诺总统。军方的方针是始终保全总统。这样做大概是基于这样的判断：尽管事态正常化的步子有些放慢，但保全在人民中间还受到广泛支持的总统是有利的。”
    共同社驻雅加达记者渡边、藤井三月二十八日报道了三月二十七日宣布成立新内阁。报道说：“印度尼西亚政局由于二十七日改组内阁而告一段落。名义上是改组内阁，而实质上则是成立新型的内阁，也可以说是把纳苏蒂安—苏哈托的军部领导体制用制度确定下来的内阁。”
    报道说：“事实上已经被束缚住手足的苏加诺总统只能朝着成为‘象征’的道路前进。预料苏哈托、马利克、苏丹·哈孟库·布沃诺等副总理以及由在他们背后的纳苏蒂安将军掌握实权的主席团，将逐步扩大‘通常的职权’范围，一点一点地取消苏加诺总统的发言权。”
    报道说：“在这种过程中，可能遇到苏加诺总统的抵抗，也可能多少遇到些挫折，但是根本不能设想会发生推翻现体制的事情。纳苏蒂安将军在这次改组内阁中虽然将只担任部长级的粉碎马来西亚指挥部副总司令，……预料不久将走到政治舞台的前台上来。”
    报道说，新内阁所面临着的是外交和经济问题。“特别严重的是如何重建面临破产的印度尼西亚经济。因此，首先势必要依赖外国的紧急援助。”预料纳苏蒂安将“重新研究同苏联的关系”，另一方面“逐步地采取接近西方的政策”。
