    Xinhua News Agency, Dhaka, 15th. Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, Chen Yi, delivered a speech at a reception hosted by the Dhaka Municipality on the 15th. The full text is as follows: Respected President Mohammad Ayub Khan, Respected Governor Abdul Monem Khan, Respected Chairman Mainuddin Chowdhury, Dear Friends:

    A few days ago, we visited West Pakistan and received an extremely warm welcome. Today, we have come to Dhaka, the capital of East Pakistan, and have received the same warm welcome. Now, the Dhaka Municipal Council is holding such a grand reception for us, giving us the opportunity to meet friends from all walks of life in Dhaka. We are very happy. On behalf of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and my colleagues, and in my own name, I express my gratitude for your profound friendship. Here, I would like to extend the cordial greetings of the 650 million Chinese people to the brothers and sisters of East Pakistan.

    China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors. Our two peoples have always sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle for and safeguarding national independence, and have forged a deep friendship. Pakistani friends have repeatedly praised the Chinese people for supporting you against India's armed aggression last year. We are very grateful for your high evaluation of the Chinese people. The Chinese people have always supported the people of the world against oppression and aggression. Our support for your anti-aggression struggle is merely fulfilling our due obligations. Moreover, in our view, support has always been mutual. Your anti-aggression struggle not only safeguarded Pakistan's sovereignty and dignity, but also made an important contribution to safeguarding peace in this region. This is a strong support for the Chinese people. If thanks are needed, then we should first thank you.

    Some people say that China's support for Pakistan against Indian aggression and its support for the Kashmiri people's struggle for the right to self-determination is "adding fuel to the fire" and "fishing in troubled waters." This statement completely reverses right and wrong. Is it not "adding fuel to the fire" unless China, like them, does not support the victims of aggression but provides the aggressors with large quantities of weapons? Is it not "fishing in troubled waters" unless China, like them, supports India's annexation of Kashmir and pretends to be an impartial mediator? We have always distinguished between right and wrong and adhered to principles. We believe that only by supporting the victims of aggression and combating the aggressors can we uphold justice and safeguard peace. In the future, whether it is East Pakistan or West Pakistan, if it is once again subjected to armed attack by aggressors, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will continue to support the Pakistani people in their struggle to safeguard national independence, national sovereignty, and unity. As long as the Kashmiri people are still subjected to cruel oppression and are not given freedom, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will continue to support the Kashmiri people in their struggle for the right to self-determination. No matter how others curse and slander us, our position will never change.

    The struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to win and safeguard national independence is a historical torrent. No matter how imperialism and old and new colonialism stir up countercurrents, they cannot stop it. Their aggression positions around the world are like volcanoes, erupting at any time. In particular, the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation has achieved brilliant victories. The American people have also awakened, and their movement against their government's policy of aggression and war is expanding.

    In order to save themselves from their fate of failure, imperialism and old and new colonialism are carrying out frantic counterattacks. The national independence movement of the Asian and African peoples is a thorn in their side. They are betting on Southeast Asia, where the current struggle is most acute, in an attempt to extinguish the anti-imperialist flames in this region. The U.S. government has formally announced that its global strategic center has shifted to the Far East. It regards China, which resolutely supports the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of all countries, as its main enemy. On the one hand, it is expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam; on the other hand, it is plotting to establish a encirclement around China. Its military provocations and war threats against China are becoming increasingly blatant. China loves peace. However, if U.S. imperialism insists on imposing war on us, we are determined to resist to the end at any cost and make our own contribution to defeating imperialism and defending world peace.

    The United States is indeed actively preparing to attack China. But in order to achieve this goal, it must first control the countries and regions around China. The United States is precisely using the banner of "anti-China" to force these countries to abandon their independent and autonomous policies and submit to the strategic needs of the United States. If they are not controlled by it and do not listen to its commands, it will engage in subversion and sabotage. Although Africa is thousands of miles away from China, when imperialism carries out subversion and sabotage there, it also shouts and screams against China to divert the people's attention. The Asian and African peoples cannot be deceived, and China cannot be isolated. Imperialism regards China as its main enemy, which is China's glory. This proves that China's firm support for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of all countries is not just empty talk, but is saying what it means and meaning what it says. The perverse actions of imperialism have made the people of Asian and African countries more clearly recognize who their enemies are and who their friends are. Let the people of our Asian and African countries further unite and carry the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism through to the end.

    Friends! During Chairman Liu Shaoqi's and our visit to Pakistan, we personally felt the fraternal friendship of the 100 million Pakistani people for the Chinese people. We have seen with our own eyes that you are working hard to build your own country and have made remarkable achievements in developing your national economy and national culture. Your firm determination to safeguard national independence and sovereignty has also left a deep impression on us. We sincerely wish that, under the leadership of President Ayub Khan, an independent and autonomous Pakistan will become increasingly prosperous and strong. We also wish that the friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples will be increasingly consolidated and developed. Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship!

    中国坚决支援各国人民反帝革命斗争说到做到
    如巴基斯坦再遭侵略，克什米尔人民还受压迫，中国就继续予以支持如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加在我们头上，中国人民决心抵抗到底
    新华社达卡十五日电　中华人民共和国国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅十五日在达卡市民招待会上讲话，全文如下：尊敬的穆罕默德·阿尤布·汗总统阁下，尊敬的阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗省督阁下，尊敬的迈努丁·乔杜里主席阁下，亲爱的朋友们：
    十几天以前，我们访问了西巴基斯坦，受到了极其热烈的欢迎。今天，我们来到东巴基斯坦首府达卡，受到了同样热烈的欢迎。现在，达卡市政委员会又为我们举行这样盛大的招待会，使我们有机会能同达卡各界朋友们见面，我们感到十分高兴。我代表刘少奇主席和我的同事们，并且以我个人的名义，对你们这种深情厚谊表示感谢。在这里，我要向东巴基斯坦的兄弟姊妹们转达六亿五千万中国人民亲切的问候。
    中国和巴基斯坦是友好的近邻。我们两国人民在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，一向互相同情，互相支持，结成了深厚的友谊。巴基斯坦朋友们一再称赞去年中国人民支持你们反对印度的武装侵略。我们十分感谢你们对中国人民的崇高评价。中国人民一贯支持世界人民反对压迫和侵略。我们支持你们反侵略的斗争，不过是尽了自己应尽的义务。而且在我们看来，支持从来是相互的。你们的反侵略斗争不仅维护了巴基斯坦的主权和尊严，而且对保卫这个地区的和平也做出了重要的贡献。这就是对中国人民的有力支持。如果需要感谢的话，那末我们应当首先感谢你们。
    有些人说，中国支持巴基斯坦反对印度侵略、支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利，是“火上加油”，是“混水摸鱼”。这种说法完全颠倒了是非。难道要中国象他们那样，不支持侵略的受害者，而给侵略者提供大批武器，才不是“火上加油”吗？难道要中国象他们那样，支持印度吞并克什米尔，又装扮成公正的调停人，才不是“混水摸鱼”吗？我们一贯分清是非，坚持原则。我们认为，只有支持被侵略者，打击侵略者，才能伸张正义，维护和平。今后，不论是东巴基斯坦，或者是西巴基斯坦，如果再一次遭到侵略者的武装进攻，中国政府和中国人民将继续支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、维护国家主权和统一的斗争。只要克什米尔人民还受到残酷的压迫，得不到自由，中国政府和中国人民将继续支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的斗争。不管别人怎样咒骂和诬蔑，我们这个立场是决不会改变的。
    亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，是一股历史洪流。帝国主义和新老殖民主义不管怎样掀起逆流，也阻挡不住。他们在世界各地的侵略阵地，象一座一座的火山，随时都在爆发。特别是越南人民的抗美救国斗争取得了辉煌的胜利。美国人民也觉醒起来，他们反对本国政府的侵略政策和战争政策的运动正在扩大。
    为了挽救失败的命运，帝国主义和新老殖民主义正在进行疯狂的反扑。亚非人民的民族独立运动是他们的眼中钉，他们把赌注押在当前斗争最尖锐的东南亚，妄图扑灭这个地区的反帝火焰。美国政府正式宣布，它的全球战略中心已经转移到远东。它把坚决支持各国人民反帝革命斗争的中国，看成是主要的敌人。它一方面扩大侵略越南的战争，另一方面在中国周围策划建立一个包围圈。它对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁越来越露骨。中国是热爱和平的。但是，如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加在我们头上，我们决心不惜任何代价，抵抗到底，为打败帝国主义、保卫世界和平作出自己的贡献。
    美国确实是在积极准备进攻中国。但是，为了达到这个目的，它首先要把中国周围的国家和地区控制起来。美国正是打着“反华”的旗号，强迫这些国家放弃独立自主的政策，屈从美国的战略需要。如果不受它的控制，不听它的指挥，它就搞颠覆破坏。非洲同中国相隔万里，但是帝国主义在那里进行颠覆破坏的时候，也大喊大叫地反华，来转移人民的视线。亚非人民是欺骗不了的，中国是孤立不了的。帝国主义把中国看成是主要的敌人，这是中国的光荣。这证明，中国坚决支援各国人民的反帝革命斗争，不是说说空话，而是说到做到。帝国主义的倒行逆施，使亚非各国人民更加认清，谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。让我们亚非各国人民进一步团结起来，把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底。
    朋友们！刘少奇主席和我们在访问巴基斯坦期间，亲身感受到一亿巴基斯坦人民对中国人民的兄弟情谊。我们亲眼看到，你们辛勤劳动，建设自己的国家，在发展民族经济和民族文化方面，取得了显著的成就。你们维护国家独立和主权的坚定意志，也给我们留下了深刻的印象。我们衷心地祝愿，在阿尤布·汗总统的领导下，独立自主的巴基斯坦日益繁荣昌盛。我们同样祝愿，中巴两国人民的友谊日益巩固和发展。中巴友好万岁！
