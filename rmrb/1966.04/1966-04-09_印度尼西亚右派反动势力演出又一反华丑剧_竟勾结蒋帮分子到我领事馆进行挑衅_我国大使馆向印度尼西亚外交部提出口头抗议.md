    Indonesian Right-Wing Reactionary Forces Stage Another Anti-China Farce
    They Even Colluded with Chiang Kai-shek Gang Elements to Provoke Our Consulate
    Our Embassy Lodges Verbal Protest with Indonesian Foreign Ministry
    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th dispatch from Jakarta: On April 2nd, right-wing reactionary forces in Medan, Indonesia, openly colluded with local Chiang Kai-shek gang secret agents, coercing a group of Indonesian-Chinese youths and students to conduct a provocative demonstration at the Chinese Consulate in Medan.
    At 11:00 a.m. on April 2nd, a group of Chinese students and youths, led by Chiang Kai-shek gang secret agents, demonstrated at the Chinese Consulate in Medan. Prior to this, they had participated in a so-called "Overseas Chinese Pledge of Loyalty Conference" hosted by Chiang Kai-shek gang secret agents and core members of the "Three People's Principles Youth League." After arriving at the Chinese Consulate in Medan, the Indonesian police guarding the consulate not only did not stop them, but intentionally allowed them to enter the consulate courtyard, raise the Indonesian flag on the Chinese consulate's flagpole, and allow Americans present to take pictures. The reactionary ringleaders in charge also took the lead in shouting anti-China slogans, but because many people were forced to participate, few followed in shouting slogans, and many left midway.
    This anti-China demonstration lasted for one hour.
    The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has lodged a verbal protest with the Indonesian Foreign Ministry regarding the anti-China provocation openly carried out by Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in collusion with Chiang Kai-shek gang elements.

    印度尼西亚右派反动势力演出又一反华丑剧
    竟勾结蒋帮分子到我领事馆进行挑衅
    我国大使馆向印度尼西亚外交部提出口头抗议
    新华社八日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚棉兰的右派反动势力四月二日公然勾结当地蒋帮特务分子，胁迫一批印度尼西亚籍华裔青年和学生到中国驻棉兰领事馆进行挑衅性的示威。
    四月二日上午十一时，一批华裔学生和青年，在蒋帮特务分子的率领下，到中国驻棉兰领事馆示威。在这以前，他们曾经参加了由蒋帮特务分子和“三青团”骨干分子主持的所谓“华裔效忠大会”。在到达中国驻棉兰领事馆以后，守卫领事馆的印度尼西亚警察不但不加阻止，反而有意让他们进入领事馆院内，在中国领事馆的旗杆上升起印度尼西亚国旗，并让在场的美国人拍照。担任指挥的反动头目还带头喊叫反华口号，但是，由于许多人是被迫参加的，跟着喊口号的寥寥无几，而且有许多人中途即离去。
    这次反华示威历时一小时。
    中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆已经就印度尼西亚右派反动势力公然勾结蒋帮分子进行反华挑衅事件向印度尼西亚外交部提出口头抗议。
