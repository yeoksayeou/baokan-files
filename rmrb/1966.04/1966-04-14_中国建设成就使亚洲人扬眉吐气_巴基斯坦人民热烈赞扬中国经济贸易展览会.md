    The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, which opened in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, on March 16, caused a sensation throughout Karachi. Over the three weeks of the exhibition, it received 500,000 visitors. Especially during the first week, the 1,500-square-meter exhibition received an average of over 30,000 visitors per day, with a peak of 60,000 visitors on one day. The exhibition hall was often packed, and many people waited outside to enter. In the evenings, the open-air cinema showed Chinese films, which were always filled to capacity.

    The exhibition was housed in a magnificent Chinese palace-style building. The scarlet structure was constructed with steel pipe and aluminum sheet, built by the more than 30 staff members of the Chinese exhibition delegation who prepared the exhibition themselves. Diplomatic officials and staff from the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan also participated in the labor. Many citizens praised the rapid progress of the project, with the entire building structure completed in twelve days.

    The exhibition displayed over 3,000 exhibits of machinery, chemicals, radio equipment, instruments, medical equipment, textiles, food, rubber, agricultural and sideline products, as well as fine arts and handicrafts produced in China in recent years. There were also electric models of China's farmland water conservancy construction and mechanized mines. Many Pakistani visitors expressed admiration and praise for China's construction achievements. Some said, "The exhibition adds glory to Asians and makes Asians hold their heads high." Farmers from the suburbs and inland areas lingered around the Chinese agricultural machinery and small and medium-sized farm tools, reluctant to leave. They examined each piece carefully and tested them. Some enthusiastically kissed the tractors. Others gently stroked the farm tools, giving a thumbs up and repeatedly saying "Good! Good!"

    Chairman Mao's works were the most beloved exhibits for many visitors. The "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" and "Selected Military Writings of Mao Zedong" sold at the exhibition's kiosk were sold out in three days. Many students, office workers, and intellectuals often lingered near the display window showcasing Chairman Mao's works, reluctant to leave. They requested that the Chairman Mao's works displayed in the window be sold to them after the exhibition closed. Many visitors expressed their respect to Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, in the guest book. Many people, including rural women and elderly women with white hair, waited for two or three hours to obtain a commemorative badge engraved with Chairman Mao's portrait.

    The Pakistani people enthusiastically visited the Chinese exhibition not only to understand China's construction achievements but also to express their deep friendship with the Chinese people. Especially in the days before Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Pakistan, many people came to the exhibition hall to shake hands with the Chinese staff and express their welcome to Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit.

    Many people wrote in the exhibition's guest book to thank China for the support it provided when Pakistan suffered from Indian armed aggression. A Pakistani poet wrote:
    "Roses bloom sometimes, and sometimes fall,
    Others may forget you,
    We will never forget China."

    On the eve of Chairman Liu Shaoqi's arrival in Karachi, the exhibition was filled with an atmosphere of Sino-Pakistani friendship. A group of Pakistani students, wearing badges with Chairman Liu Shaoqi's portrait and carrying a banner sewn with the national flags of China and Pakistan, came to the exhibition. They pinned badges with Chairman Liu Shaoqi's portrait on each member of the exhibition delegation. Then, they gave speeches to the crowd waiting to visit the exhibition outside the gate, publicizing the great significance of Sino-Pakistani friendship. They shouted "Long live Sino-Pakistani friendship," "Down with U.S. imperialism," and "We condemn U.S. aggression against Vietnam."

    The exhibition not only deepened the Pakistani people's understanding of China's economic construction achievements and promoted Sino-Pakistani friendship but also strengthened the confidence of many visitors in building their own country through self-reliance. A geography teacher, after seeing the aviation gasoline extracted and refined by China itself at the exhibition, said, "I have taught geography for so many years, and no textbook has ever said that China has abundant oil reserves. Now you have not only found a large amount of oil but also refined high-grade gasoline, which is truly remarkable. Western countries are still saying that Pakistan is an 'oil-poor country.' I believe that Pakistan will also be able to find its own oil." An engineering technician said, "The Soviet Union withdrew its experts from China in 1960. You relied on self-reliance and produced so many high-end products. Now I understand that economic construction should first rely on oneself." In the exhibition's guest book, one visitor wrote, "China's spirit of building the country through self-reliance makes us know that it is possible to build Pakistan into a strong country with our own hands." Another visitor wrote, "Let the Americans come and see this exhibition! Asian and African countries can achieve amazing progress without them, and China is a practical and living example."

### 中国建设成就使亚洲人扬眉吐气  巴基斯坦人民热烈赞扬中国经济贸易展览会

    中国建设成就使亚洲人扬眉吐气
    巴基斯坦人民热烈赞扬中国经济贸易展览会
    中国经济贸易展览会三月十六日在巴基斯坦最大城市卡拉奇开幕后，轰动了全卡拉奇市，在展出的三个星期中，先后接待了五十万观众。特别是在开幕的第一周，占地一千五百平方米的展览会，每天平均要接待三万多观众，最多的一天达六万人。展览会内往往挤得水泄不通，展览会外也挤满了许多等候参观的人群。晚上，展览会露天电影场放映中国电影，更是自始至终座无虚席。
    展览会设在一座壮丽的中国宫殿式建筑内，这所朱红色的建筑内部都是钢管铝板结构，它是由筹备展览的三十多名中国展览团工作人员自己动手建造起来的。中国驻巴基斯坦大使馆的外交官员和工作人员也都参加了劳动。许多市民赞叹工程进展迅速，十二天就全部完成了房屋结构。
    展览会陈列了我国近年来生产的机械、化工、无线电、仪表、医疗器械、纺织品、食品、橡胶和农副业产品以及美术、手工艺品等，共三千多种展品。此外还有我国农田水利建设、机械化矿山等电动模型。许多巴基斯坦观众，对中国的建设成就表示钦佩和赞扬。有的说“展览为亚洲人增了光，使亚洲人扬眉吐气。”来自郊区和内地的农民们围着中国的农业机械和中小型农具，恋恋不舍。他们一件一件地看了又看、试了又试。有的人热情地去吻拖拉机。有的人轻轻地抚摸着农具，竖着大拇指连声叫“好！好！”
    毛主席著作是许多参观者最心爱的展品。展览会小卖部出售的《毛泽东选集》和《毛泽东军事论文选》，在三天内便被抢购一空。常常有许多学生、职员和知识分子在陈列毛主席著作的橱窗旁边徘徊，舍不得离去。他们要求把橱窗里陈列的毛主席著作在展览会闭幕后卖给他们。许多参观者在留言簿上向中国人民的领袖毛主席表示敬意。许多人为了向展览团索要一枚刻有毛主席肖象的纪念章，不惜等候两三个小时，其中有农村妇女和白发苍苍的老太太。
    巴基斯坦人民踊跃参观中国展览会，不仅是为了了解中国的建设成就，而且是为了表达对中国人民深厚的情谊。特别是在刘少奇主席到巴基斯坦访问的前几天，许多人特地到展览馆来和中国工作人员握手，表示欢迎刘少奇主席的访问。
    很多人在展览会的留言簿上写下了感谢中国在巴基斯坦遭受印度武装侵略时所给予的支持。一位巴基斯坦诗人写道：
    “玫瑰花，有时开，有时落，
    别人可以忘记你，
    我们永远不会忘记中国”。
    在刘少奇主席到达卡拉奇的前夕，展览会上更是洋溢着中巴友好的气氛。一群巴基斯坦学生身上佩戴着刘少奇主席肖象的徽章，打着用中巴两国国旗缝制的横幅来到了展览会。他们为展览团工作人员一个个戴上刘少奇主席肖象的徽章。接着又向拥在展览会门外等待参观的群众讲演，宣传中巴友谊的重大意义。他们高呼“巴中友谊万岁”，“打倒美帝国主义”，“我们谴责美帝侵略越南”。
    展览会不仅加深了巴基斯坦人民对中国经济建设成就的了解，促进了中巴友好，而且使许多观众增强了自力更生建设自己国家的信心。一位地理教员在展览会上看到了中国自己开采和炼制的航空用汽油时说：“我教了多少年的地理，从来没有一本教科书说中国有丰富的石油矿藏，现在你们不但找到了大量的石油，还炼出了高级汽油，真了不起。现在西方国家还在说巴基斯坦是‘贫油国’，我相信巴基斯坦也一定能找到自己的石油。”一位工程技术人员说：“苏联在一九六○年从中国撤走了专家，你们自力更生，生产了这样多的高级产品，现在我明白了，经济建设首先应该依靠自己。”在展览会的留言簿上一位参观者写道：“中国自力更生建设国家的精神，使我们知道依靠自己的双手把巴基斯坦建设成为强大的国家是可能的。”还有一位参观者写道：“让美国佬来看看这个展览会吧！亚非国家离开他们就能获得惊人的进步，中国就是一个实际的活的榜样”。
