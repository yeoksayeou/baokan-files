    Absolutely No Capitalist Restoration Conspiracy Allowed
    Liu Ruming, Company Commander of a Certain Unit of the People's Liberation Army
    I am a People's Liberation Army soldier with a rudimentary knowledge of literacy. I don't understand the "history" that Comrade Wu Han plays with, but I do understand the history of the revolution, the history of the people. After reading Comrade Wu Han's works such as "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," I was very angry. Comrade Wu Han is actually colluding with imperialism, revisionism, and domestic right-leaning opportunists to launch a massive attack on the Party and on socialism. In "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor," he used the technique of veiled criticism to scold the Party Central Committee and socialism. This was to encourage those right-leaning opportunists, motivating them to counterattack the Party and socialism. When our entire nation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, defeated the rampant attacks of right-leaning opportunists inside and outside the Party and removed those right-leaning opportunists from their positions, Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" emerged. Comrade Wu Han called on right-leaning opportunists to "not fear tyranny," encouraged them not to be pessimistic and discouraged, to persist in their struggle, accumulate strength, and stage a comeback.
    Socialist society was achieved by the people of the entire country under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao through decades of struggle. It was bought with the blood and sacrifice of millions of revolutionary people. The workers, peasants, and soldiers of the whole country love the Party, love Chairman Mao, and love socialism, while class enemies at home and abroad slander the Party and hate socialism. Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" speak for the right-leaning opportunists. We revolutionary soldiers must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, and fight to the end against Comrade Wu Han and all anti-Party, anti-socialist right-leaning opportunists. We will absolutely not allow them to stir up trouble and engage in capitalist restoration.

    决不容许搞资本主义复辟阴谋
    解放军某部连长　刘汝明
    我是个粗识文字的解放军战士，不懂得吴晗同志所玩弄的“历史”，却懂得革命的历史，人民的历史。看了吴晗同志《海瑞骂皇帝》《海瑞罢官》等作品后，我非常气愤。吴晗同志实际上是配合帝国主义、修正主义和国内的右倾机会主义分子，来大肆向党、向社会主义进攻。他在《海瑞骂皇帝》中以指桑骂槐的手法，骂党中央，骂社会主义。这是为那些右倾机会主义分子打气，鼓动他们向党、向社会主义反扑。当我们全国人民在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，打垮了党内外右倾机会主义分子的猖狂进攻，革了右倾机会主义分子的职的时候，吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》出笼了。吴晗同志号召右倾机会主义者“不畏强暴”，鼓励他们别悲观泄气，坚持斗争，积蓄力量，卷土重来。
    社会主义社会是全国人民在党中央、毛主席的正确领导下，经过几十年的斗争取得的，是千百万革命的人民流血牺牲换来的。全国的工人、农民、战士热爱党，热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义，而国内外的阶级敌人谩骂党，仇恨社会主义。吴晗同志的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》就是替右倾机会主义者说话的。我们革命战士，一定牢记毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，向吴晗同志、向一切反党反社会主义的右倾机会主义分子斗争到底，决不容许他们兴风作浪，搞资本主义复辟。
