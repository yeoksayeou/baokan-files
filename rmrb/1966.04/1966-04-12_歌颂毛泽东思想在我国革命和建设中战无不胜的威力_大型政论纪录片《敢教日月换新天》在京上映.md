    Xinhua News Agency, April 11th: The large-scale political documentary "Daring to Change the Sun and Moon," newly produced by the Central Newsreel and Documentary Film Studio, premiered today in nineteen cinemas in the capital. The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Culture held a premiere reception this evening.
    Against the backdrop of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle history of the past century, and focusing on the tremendous changes since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the film depicts the profound impact of the great Mao Zedong Thought on Chinese history.
    Using authentic and typical film footage, the film narrates how the Chinese people, under the multiple oppressions and exploitations of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, clenched their fists and waged a heroic struggle to overthrow the three great mountains. "So many deeds cry out to be done, and always urgently; the world rolls on, time presses. Ten thousand years are too long, seize the day, seize the hour!" The Chinese people shed their blood and sacrificed their lives, experienced one setback after another, and finally, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, defeated Chiang Kai-shek, who was armed by U.S. imperialism, and established a new China.
    The film devotes its main portion to recording how the Chinese people began a new struggle on a scene of ruins after liberation. Based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, the Party and Chairman Mao summarized the experiences and lessons of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, and formulated the general line for socialist construction in our country. Encouraged by this general line, our people have been striving for strength, building the country through diligence and thrift, and using Mao Zedong Thought as the highest instruction and powerful weapon, smashed the attacks of various enemies at home and abroad, overcame various difficulties on the road forward, renewed the spiritual outlook of the people, and changed the landscape of the motherland. Our friends are all over the world.
    The film enthusiastically praises the invincible power of Mao Zedong Thought in our country's new democratic revolution, as well as in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Through the nationwide study of Chairman Mao's works, learning from the People's Liberation Army, Daqing, Dazhai, learning from contemporary heroes such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, and Jiao Yulu, the film shows the Chinese people's firm determination to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, keep the motherland in mind, have the world in view, accelerate the advancement of socialist revolution and construction, and support the world people's revolutionary cause. The film's demonstration of the majestic spirit of "every citizen a soldier" shows that if U.S. imperialism dares to impose war on the Chinese people, the Chinese people are fully prepared and will make their own contributions to the world people's revolutionary cause.
    With its rich content, profound thinking, and eloquent logic, this film tells people what a tremendous change has taken place in China in nearly a century, and what far-reaching significance this change will have for the whole world. The widespread release of this film will vigorously promote the national people's study of Chairman Mao's works, the successful completion of the Third Five-Year Plan, and the opposition to U.S. imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revisionism.

    新华社十一日讯　中央新闻纪录电影制片厂新编制的大型政论纪录片《敢教日月换新天》今天在首都十九家影院同时上映。北京市文化局今晚举行了首映招待会。
    这部影片以我国人民近百年来的革命斗争历史为背景，以中华人民共和国成立以来的巨大变化为重点，描绘了伟大的毛泽东思想给中国历史带来的深刻影响。
    影片用真实、典型的电影资料，叙述了中国人民在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的重重压迫和剥削下，握起拳头，进行了推翻三座大山的英勇搏斗。“为有牺牲多壮志，敢教日月换新天”，中国人民抛头颅、洒热血，经历了一个又一个的挫折，终于在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，打倒了美帝国主义武装起来的蒋介石，建立了新中国。
    影片以主要篇幅，纪录中国人民解放以后怎样在一片废墟上开始新的斗争。根据马克思列宁主义的原理，党和毛主席总结了中国革命和建设社会主义的经验教训，制定了我国社会主义建设的总路线。在这条总路线的鼓舞下，我国人民奋发图强、勤俭建国，以毛泽东思想为最高指示和强大武器，粉碎了国内外各种敌人的进攻，克服了前进道路上的各种困难，使人民的精神面貌焕然一新，祖国的江山换了模样。我们的朋友遍于全世界。
    影片热情地歌颂了毛泽东思想在我国新民主主义革命以及在社会主义革命和社会主义建设过程中战无不胜的威力。影片通过全国人民大学毛主席著作，学习中国人民解放军、大庆、大寨，学习雷锋、王杰、焦裕禄等当代英雄人物，表明了中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，胸怀祖国，放眼世界，加速推进社会主义革命和建设，支援世界人民革命事业的坚定决心。影片所展示的全民皆兵的雄伟气概表明：美帝国主义如果胆敢把战争强加到中国人民头上，中国人民是有充分准备的，并将为世界人民的革命事业作出自己的贡献。
    这部影片以它丰富的内容、深刻的思想和雄辩的逻辑告诉人们：近一个世纪以来，在中国的土地上究竟发生了一个什么样的巨大变化，这个变化对于全世界将具有什么样的深远意义。广泛上映这部影片，对于全国人民学习毛主席著作，胜利完成第三个五年计划，反对美帝国主义、各国反动派和现代修正主义，将会起有力的推动作用。
