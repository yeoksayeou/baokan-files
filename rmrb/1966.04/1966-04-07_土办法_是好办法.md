    "Native Methods" are Good Methods
    Qian Jinwei, Head of the Technology Group, Weihai Iron Factory
    In our factory's technical innovation efforts, we successfully designed and manufactured a hydraulic-electric controlled quenching machine. Comrades who came to visit all said that the machine was ingeniously designed. Giant, palm-like clamps hold the red-hot steel plates, oscillating back and forth in the cooling oil bath in a regular manner. Afterwards, the clamps automatically drop the quenched steel plates to the bottom of the pool, then jump out of the oil surface, waiting for the second steel plate to arrive...
    Oscillating the quenched parts back and forth in the oil bath is a very important operational step. It allows the steel plates to cool quickly, achieve uniform hardness, and minimize deformation during heat treatment. This operation is the culmination of our years of manual quenching experience. Countless practical operations have proven that this is a relatively good quenching method. This design, simulating manual operation, cannot be found in books.
    There are two paths to take when designing and manufacturing new machines. One is to copy foreign machines, which is ready-made and reliable, but it's impossible to get ahead of others. Our factory, taking a risk and plucking up our courage, took another path, which is to summarize the practical experience of the masses, rely on the masses to come up with ideas and methods, to manufacture machines. Some people say this is a "native method." We say that this is a correct path to catching up with and surpassing the advanced levels of the world, and it is a good method.
    "Native methods" are methods that grow indigenously from the masses, the crystallization of the wisdom of the masses, and they have vigorous vitality. All foreign methods and foreign technologies come from native methods, and all scientific and technological knowledge originates from labor. If we copy foreign machines in our design, we can only follow behind others. If we summarize the practical experience of the masses and create on our own, we will be ahead, and others can only copy us. Isn't our designed and manufactured quenching machine ahead of others in some aspects?

    “土办法”是好办法
    卫海铁工厂技术组组长　钱锦伟
    我厂工人在技术革新中，设计制造成功一台液压——电器控制的淬火机，来参观的同志都说这台机器设计得很巧妙，一只只巨大的手掌一样的夹具，夹着烧红的钢板，有规则地在冷却油池里，来回摆动；之后，夹具便自动把淬好火的钢板丢在池底，再跳出油面，等候第二块钢板到来。……
    把淬火件在油池里来回摆动，这道操作工序很重要，它可以使钢板冷却得快，硬度均匀，热处理变形少。这个操作，是我们在多年的手工淬火的经验结晶。无数次的操作实践证明，这是比较好的淬火方法。这个模拟手工操作作出的设计，在书本上是找不到的。
    设计制造新机器，有两条路好走。一条是照抄洋机器，既现成，又稳当，但是不可能走到人家前面去。我们厂冒着风险，壮着胆量，走了另一条路，即总结群众的实践经验，依靠群众出主意想办法，来制造机器。有人说，这是“土办法”。我们说，这是赶超世界先进水平的一条正道，是个好办法。
    “土办法”，就是从群众中土生土长出来的办法，是群众智慧的结晶，它有旺盛的生命力。一切洋办法洋技术都是从土办法来的，一切科学技术知识都是从劳动中发源的。如果我们照抄洋机器作设计，就只能老是跟在人家屁股后边走。如果我们去总结群众的实践经验，自己来创造，我们就走到了头里，别人就只能来抄我们的了。我们设计制造的淬火机，在某些方面不是走在别人前头了吗？
