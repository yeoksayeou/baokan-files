    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 3rd dispatch: According to the Pathet Lao Radio broadcast, from March 15th to 26th, eighty-four officers and soldiers from the Kong Le troops and the right-wing army successively surrendered to the Lao People's Liberation Army and the people in the Mang Hien area of Luang Prabang Province, receiving a warm welcome from patriotic soldiers and civilians.
    These surrendered officers and soldiers said that they had seen the dark future of serving in Kong Le's and the right-wing's forces and would no longer serve as cannon fodder for American imperialism. They are determined to turn their guns around and, together with patriotic soldiers and civilians, wage a struggle against American imperialism and its running dogs to win genuine independence and peace for their motherland.
    Xinhua News Agency, Kang Kai, 2nd dispatch: According to the "Voice of Laos" radio broadcast: Soldiers of the Kong Le troops, who have repeatedly failed in their attacks on the Phou Khout mountain area in Xieng Khouang Province, are increasingly weary of war. Recently, they have been opposing the orders of reactionary commanders, demanding to return to their camps, and are unwilling to continue serving as cannon fodder for the American invasion of Laos.
    The radio station said that after the soldiers of the 5th Paratroop Battalion of the Kong Le troops failed in their recent attack on the Phou Khout mountain area, they refused to fight again.
    Prior to this, soldiers of the 85th Paratroop Battalion of the Kong Le troops had also opposed the orders of reactionary commanders and demanded to return to their camps.
    According to another broadcast from the radio station, after the Kong Le troops launched a disastrous attack on Phou Khout mountain from March 15th to 20th, many officers and soldiers posted letters on trees before withdrawing. The letters said, "We do not want to fight the patriotic forces. We were forced to come here by reactionary commanders. The patriotic forces' counterattack is completely correct, and we fully support you."

    一批贡勒部队和右派官兵不甘为美帝及其走狗卖命
    向老挝解放军投诚受到热烈欢迎
    新华社康开三日电　据巴特寮电台广播：从三月十五日到二十六日，有八十四名贡勒部队和右派军队的官兵，陆续向琅勃拉邦省芒显地区的老挝人民解放军和人民投诚，受到爱国军民的热烈欢迎。
    这些投诚的官兵们说，他们看清了给贡勒和右派当兵的黑暗前途，再也不给美帝国主义当炮灰了。他们决心掉转枪口，同爱国军民一起，进行反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争，争取祖国的真正独立和和平。
    新华社康开二日电　据“老挝之声”电台广播：进攻川圹省富科特山地区接连遭到失败的贡勒部队士兵厌战情绪日益增长。最近他们纷纷反对反动指挥官的命令，要求返回营地，不愿再为美国侵略老挝充当炮灰。
    这家电台说，贡勒部队第五伞兵营的士兵在最近进攻富科特山地区失败后，不肯再去打仗。
    在这以前，贡勒部队第八十五伞兵营士兵也曾反对反动指挥官的命令，要求返回他们的营地。
    另据这家电台广播，贡勒部队在三月十五日到二十日向富科特山发动的进攻遭到惨败后，许多官兵在撤走以前把信件贴在树上，信中说，“我们是不想同爱国力量打仗的，我们是被反动指挥官强迫来的，爱国力量的反击是十分正确的，我们完全支持你们”。
