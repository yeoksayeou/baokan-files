　　Jiangxi organized a large number of cadres, workers, educated youth and urban residents to enter the mountains to develop and build them, and set up a large number of reclamation farms, which gained important experience in developing mountainous areas and greatly changed the face of the mountains. The situation and experience of the Damai Mountain Reclamation Farm in Jiangxi introduced here is worth reading.

　　Our country is a mountainous country, with mountains accounting for most of the land area. Developing mountain construction, afforestation is a central link. With the development of mountain forests, not only will the mountain economy develop in an all-round way, but it will also greatly promote agricultural production in the plains, as well as the development of industry, handicrafts, and commerce.

　　In recent years, various places have achieved many accomplishments and gained experience in developing mountainous areas and managing mountain forests, and have a certain understanding of the laws of mountain construction. However, in this area, there is still a large "realm of necessity" to be explored, and there is still a lot of blindness in the work. Some people only know how to "eat the mountains" but do not know how to "nourish the mountains," resulting in fewer and fewer mountain forest resources. Some places are not good at managing forests, with many trees planted but few surviving, resulting in some barren mountains and bald ridges not being transformed for a long time. In individual places, the green mountains and clear waters have become bare mountains and turbid waters. People in the plains are unwilling to enter the mountains, but people in the mountains want to go down the mountains. The comrades of Damai Mountain Reclamation Farm have also suffered in this regard. Through repeated practice, they gradually realized that mountain construction must be centered on forestry construction, and forestry construction must be based on afforestation and forest management. In other words, to cure the water and the fields, one must first cure the mountains; to cure the mountains, one must first build the forests. Only when the green mountains are always there can the green waters flow forever, and can it drive the comprehensive development of the mountain economy.

　　At the beginning of entering the mountains, the comrades of Damai Mountain Reclamation Farm were not very clear about the management ideas of the reclamation farm. They focused on logging, sideline occupations, and even destroying forests to grow grain, but did not engage in afforestation and forest management. They only cared about immediate interests and did not pay attention to long-term construction, and did not understand the dialectical relationship between eating the mountains and nourishing the mountains, logging and renewal, and of course they could not find the correct way to deal with these relationships. Even some forest farms created successful experiences, but they could not see them, let alone summarize and promote them. For example, the experience of Wangshan Forest Farm in combining forestry and agriculture, and using short-term gains to support long-term development, and the experience of Nanxi Forest Farm in correctly handling the relationship between logging and renewal, did not attract the attention of leaders. Later, they creatively studied and applied Comrade Mao Zedong's works, and through self-revolution, clarified the purpose of running the farm, established the lofty ideal of building the mountain area into a socialist forestry base, used the materialist dialectical viewpoint to analyze the objective reality, find the main contradictions, re-recognize and summarize the successful experience of some forest farms, had a further understanding of the objective world, and gradually found the correct policy for building the farm.

　　The changes in Damai Mountain Reclamation Farm show that to truly build the mountain area well, we must first establish the revolutionary thought of building a socialist cause with a broad vision, and establish the long-term construction thought of being responsible for the mountain people for generations to come, and not, as many people criticize the phenomenon of only logging but not managing, "sitting and eating the mountains empty, the mountains are exhausted." The rulers of the old society frantically plundered mountain forests without regard to construction. Today, the mountains belong to the people, are socialist mountains, and are mountains on the road to communism. We can only build the mountain areas better and better, and there is no reason to only care about the present without regard to the long-term. We must not only keep the green mountains in the mountain areas forever, and the trees will be cut more and more, but also have grain and oil, develop electricity and transportation, develop cultural and health undertakings, gradually change the backward appearance of the mountain areas, and gradually make the mountain area construction catch up with the plain areas. To realize the great ideal of communism, we must not only gradually narrow the gap between cities and villages, but also gradually narrow the gap between plains and mountains. We must vigorously build mountain areas to narrow this gap. With such a lofty ideal, we can stand tall and see far, and will not be blinded by immediate interests and forget the centennial cause. The comrades of Damai Mountain Reclamation Farm have improved their revolutionary consciousness in building the mountain area in practice, and have further understood and mastered the laws of mountain construction, and found the correct management policies and methods.

　　Our country has a vast territory, and the natural characteristics of the mountains in the east, west, north and south are different. Even in the same mountain area, the situations in deep mountains and shallow mountains, here and there are different. The so-called "a foot higher in the mountain, a big difference," is the meaning. The Damai Mountain area has a large population, many mountains, and little arable land. The specific practices here may not be suitable for other places. All localities must proceed from their own realities and find management methods that suit local characteristics. However, the idea of the comrades in Damai Mountain of using revolutionary spirit to create a new socialist mountain area, and the idea of building a socialist forestry base based on afforestation and forest management, are worth learning from all localities and should be greatly promoted.

### 创百年大业

    创百年大业
    江西组织大批干部、职工、知识青年和城镇居民进山，开发山区，建设山区，兴办了大批垦殖场，取得了开发山区的重要经验，使山区面貌大为改观。这里介绍的江西大茅山垦殖场的情况和经验，很值得一读。
    我国是一个多山的国家，山地占土地面积的大部。发展山区建设，造林是个中心环节。山林发展了，不仅山区经济会全面发展起来，对平原的农业生产，对工业、手工业、商业的发展，也是很大的推动。
    近几年来，各地在开发山区、经营山林方面，取得了不少的成就和经验，对山区建设的规律也有了一定的认识。但是，在这一方面，还有一个很大的“必然王国”需要探索，工作中还有不少盲目性。有些人只知“吃山”，不知“养山”，以致山林资源越来越少；有些地方营林不得法，造林多，成活少，以致有的荒山秃岭长期不得改造，个别地方的青山绿水变成了童山浊水，平原的人不愿进山，山上的人却想下山。大茅山垦殖场的同志们在这方面也吃过苦头。在反复的实践中，他们逐步体会到：山区建设必须以林业建设为中心，林业建设必须以造林营林为基础。也就是说，要想治好水、治好田，必先治好山；要想治好山，必先造好林。只有青山常在，才能绿水长流，才能带动山区经济全面发展。
    大茅山垦殖场的同志们进山之初，对垦殖场的经营思想并不是很明确的。抓采伐，抓副业，甚至毁林种粮，而不造林营林。只顾眼前利益，不注意长远建设，不懂得吃山和养山、采伐和更新的辩证关系，当然也就找不到处理这些关系的正确方法。就是有些林场创造了成功的经验，也看不见，更不要说总结推广了。象汪山林场实行林农结合、以短养长的经验，南溪林场正确处理采伐更新关系的经验，都没有引起领导者的重视。后来，他们活学活用毛泽东同志的著作，经过自我革命，明确了办场的目的，树立了把山区建设成社会主义林业基地的远大理想，用唯物辩证观点，分析客观实际，寻找主要矛盾，重新认识和总结某些林场的成功经验，对客观世界有了进一步的认识，逐步找到了正确的建场方针。
    大茅山垦殖场的变化说明，要真正建设好山区，首先要树立高瞻远瞩建设社会主义大业的革命思想，树立对山区人民子子孙孙负责的长远建设思想，而不能象很多群众对只采伐不经营的现象所批评的那样“坐吃山空，山穷水尽”。旧社会的统治者，疯狂掠夺山林而不管建设。今天，山是人民的山，是社会主义的山，是要走向共产主义的山。我们只能把山区建设得越来越好，而没有理由只顾眼前而不顾长远。我们不仅要使山区青山常在，林木愈采愈多，而且要有粮有油，要发展电力、交通，兴办文化、卫生事业，逐步改变山区的落后面貌，逐步使山区建设赶上平原地区。我们要实现共产主义的伟大理想，不但要逐步缩小城市和乡村的差别，还要逐步缩小平原和山区的差别，必须大力建设山区，才能缩小这种差别。有了这样远大的理想，就能站得高，看得远，就不会被眼前利益迷惑而忘了百年大业。大茅山垦殖场的同志们在实践中提高了建设山区的革命自觉，也就进一步认识和掌握了山区建设的规律，找到了正确的经营方针和方法。
    我国地区辽阔，东西南北的山区的自然特点各不相同；就在同一山区，深山和浅山、这里和那里的情况也有差别，所谓“山高一丈，大不一样”，就是这个意思。大茅山地区人多、山多、田少，这里的具体作法不一定适合于别的地方，各地必须因地制宜，找出适合当地特点的经营方法。但是，大茅山的同志们用革命精神创建社会主义新山区的思想，以造林营林为基础建设社会主义林业基地的思想，是值得各地学习的，是应该大大提倡的。
