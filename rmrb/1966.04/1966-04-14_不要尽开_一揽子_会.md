    Don't Always Hold "All-in-One" Meetings

    Recently, I learned in rural areas that some grassroots Party branches often use "all-in-one" meetings (such as meetings of all Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and representatives of poor and lower-middle peasants) to replace Party meetings. They believe that doing so "saves trouble" and can reach the bottom in one fell swoop. Sometimes, it is permissible to hold "all-in-one" meetings, but always holding "all-in-one" meetings has many drawbacks: First, it affects Party members' ability to better play their vanguard role. The Party Constitution stipulates that Party members should play an exemplary role in their work. Frequently holding "all-in-one" meetings without making specific demands on Party members means that Party members are not clear about how to play an exemplary role; failing to hold Party life meetings to review Party members' implementation of Party resolutions means that Party members lose organizational supervision to a considerable extent. Second, it affects the full promotion of democracy within the Party. The Party Constitution stipulates that Party members can discuss Party policies and criticize any Party organization and any staff member at Party meetings. Frequently failing to hold separate Party meetings means that Party members cannot fully offer criticisms and suggestions on the work of the branch at the meeting. Third, Party members who do not participate in Party organizational life for a long time will have their organizational concepts weakened.
    In short, replacing Party life meetings with "all-in-one" meetings will inevitably weaken the Party's fighting role. It is hoped that grassroots Party organizations in various places will not frequently replace Party meetings with "all-in-one" meetings.

### 不要尽开“一揽子”会

    不要尽开“一揽子”会
    最近，我在农村了解到一些基层党支部常用“一揽子”会（如全体党员、团员、干部、贫农下中农代表会等）代替党的会议。他们认为，这样做“省事”，可以一竿子就插到了底。有的时候，开“一揽子”会是可以的，但是尽开“一揽子”会，就有很多缺点：首先，影响党员更好地发挥先锋队的作用。党章规定，党员在工作中要起模范作用。经常开“一揽子”会，不向党员单独提出要求，党员就不明确怎样去起模范作用；不开党的生活会，检查党员执行党的决议的情况，党员就在相当程度上失去了组织监督。其次，影响党内充分发扬民主。党章规定，党员在党的会议上可以讨论党的政策，批评党的任何组织和任何工作人员。经常不单独开党的会议，党员便不能在会上充分地对支部工作提出批评和建议。第三，党员长期不过党的组织生活，组织观念就会削弱。
    总之，用“一揽子”会代替党的生活会议，必将削弱党的战斗作用。希望各地基层党组织，不要经常用“一揽子”会代替党的会议。
