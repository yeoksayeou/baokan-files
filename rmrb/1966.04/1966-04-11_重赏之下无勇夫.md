　　Heavy Rewards Fail to Produce Brave Men
　　In a paddy field belonging to the Nansi Production Team of the Yunlu Brigade, there were two piles of unclaimed human bones, which hindered plowing and wasted land. For more than ten years, due to superstition, no one had ever dared to move them. This spring plowing season, some cadres in the team said:
　　“Heavy rewards are sure to produce brave men.” So the team committee decided: whoever is willing to move them will be rewarded with ten yuan in cash and thirty jin of pond fish. However, still no one did it. Some people said: “These two piles of bones have been here for a while now, it is alright not to move them, so as not to destroy the ‘feng shui’!” Others said: “Whoever moves these two piles of bones will be ‘possessed by ghosts’ and get a stomach ache, and the reward money will not be enough to buy medicine!” When the work team cadre stationed there learned about this, he assisted the team cadres in gathering militiamen and young people for a meeting, discussing the question of whether “ghosts” existed, explaining science to everyone, making everyone understand the truth that there are no “ghosts,” and in one fell swoop, the two piles of human bones were moved away.
　　The editor of the *Southern Daily* said in the “One Thing, One Discussion” column: Moving two piles of dead people's bones in the field, which is just a simple effort, can get a reward of ten yuan and thirty jin of pond fish, which can be called a heavy reward! However, heavy rewards fail to produce brave men. The work team cadre stationed there did not award money or fish, but only promoted atheism and science to the commune members, and the commune members moved the bones that no one dared to touch for more than ten years in one fell swoop. The reason is that the commune members used to be afraid of ghosts, and money and fish could not make the commune members unafraid of ghosts, but ideological education can make the commune members break away from superstition.
　　This small matter also proves the importance of ideological work and the greatness of its power. This is a vivid lesson for those who underestimate ideological work, and it also has an enlightening effect for those who believe that money can make the devil turn the millstone and that material incentives are omnipotent!

### 重赏之下无勇夫

    重赏之下无勇夫
    云路大队南四生产队的一块稻田中，有两堆无主死人骨，妨碍犁田，浪费土地。十多年来，由于迷信，始终没有人动手把它搬走。今年春耕，队里有些干部说：
  “重赏之下必有勇夫。”于是队委决定：谁肯搬，奖给十元现金、三十斤塘鱼。但是，还是没有人干。有的人说：“这两堆骨不是现在才有的，不迁就算了，免得破坏‘风水’！”又有人说：“谁搬这两堆骨，谁就受‘鬼迷’，肚子痛，奖的钱也不够买药吃！”蹲点干部知道了这件事，便协助队干部召集民兵、青年来开会，议论有没有“鬼”的问题，给大家讲科学，使大家懂得了没有“鬼”的道理，一下子就把两堆人骨迁走了。
    《南方日报》编者在《一事一议》栏里说：搬掉田间两堆死人骨，举手之劳，可得奖十元、塘鱼三十斤，可谓重赏矣！然而，重赏之下无勇夫。蹲点干部没有奖钱，也没有奖鱼，只向社员宣传无神论，宣传科学，社员们就把十多年来都不敢动的骸骨一下子搬掉。原因是社员过去怕鬼，钱和鱼都不能使社员不怕鬼，思想教育才能使社员破除迷信。
    这件小小的事情，也证明思想工作的重要和威力的巨大。这对于那些轻视思想工作的人来说，是一堂生动的课程，对于那些信奉有钱能叫鬼推磨，物质刺激万能的人，相信也有其启发作用！
