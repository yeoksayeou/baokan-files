    How to Handle This Iron Rake?	Zhang Chongtian Chen Congchang
    Dusk. In the workshop of the Shiqiao Ironware Cooperative in Cixi County, Zhejiang Province, the workers had already finished work, but the young worker Shen Huifang was still there.
    Under the bright lights, Shen Huifang was slightly bent over, vigorously filing an iron rake with a file. He filed, looked, and filed again, working with great energy. Why was Little Shen taking such good care of this iron rake? It turned out that Little Shen had a fiancée who was participating in agricultural production in a production team in Weiqian Commune. A few days ago, she sent a message asking Little Shen to buy her a double-toothed iron rake. Little Shen bought one this afternoon and was actively processing it in his spare time, wanting to give his lover a satisfactory iron rake.
    Just then, a person came in from outside the door. He quietly walked up to Little Shen, carefully looked at the iron rake for a while, and praised, "Good iron rake!"
    Hearing someone speak, Little Shen turned his head and saw that it was Tang Yinsheng, a member of the Shiqiao Eleventh Brigade.
    Tang Yinsheng took a fancy to the iron rake at a glance. Before Little Shen could speak, he hurriedly said, "Sell me this double-toothed rake, I need it." Little Shen smiled and said, "This iron rake is good, but it has an owner. If you want one, go to the business department to buy one. We've handed in all our finished products for today."
    Tang Yinsheng said, "To tell you the truth, I've looked at all the ones in the business department, and none of them are as good as yours. I still want this one." After saying that, he picked up the iron rake and walked to the counter of the business department, wanting to get a receipt and pay for it.
    Little Shen angrily chased after him: "I'm not selling this iron rake."
    Tang Yinsheng retorted: "Who should the iron rakes made by the ironware cooperative be sold to if not the peasants?"
    At this time, the street was crowded with onlookers. Some people indignantly said, "There must be a reason for not selling it, you should tell him."
    "This one is for my lover," Little Shen finally stammered.
    Seeing this scene, the salesman, Uncle Ajiao, came out to smooth things over, saying that since Little Shen wanted to keep this one for his lover, then forget it. If Tang Yinsheng didn't like any of the ones in the business department, he could come back tomorrow and have Little Shen process one for him in the same way. Tang Yinsheng reluctantly accepted this suggestion and left with a belly full of opinions.
    Tang Yinsheng went back, and the onlookers dispersed, but the matter was not over. When Uncle Ajiao reported this matter to the branch secretary, Xu Yongyuan, Xu Yongyuan's heart was in turmoil. He thought that similar things had happened in the past. Some workers would do "super" processing in order to buy iron rakes for relatives and friends. Why could the work be done so well for relatives and friends? And why couldn't the iron rakes made for the peasants be made so well? Why? Why? Endless whys? Finally, tracing it back to the root, he felt that it was because some workers saw more of "me" in their eyes and not the 500 million peasants!
    What to do? Take today's incident to the masses for discussion to raise everyone's awareness. Let the masses use the arrow of Mao Zedong Thought to shoot at the target of their own thoughts.
    No sooner said than done. The discussion meeting will be held tonight, and it is also suggested that the iron rake processed by Little Shen and the several iron rakes left in the business department be brought to the meeting so that everyone can compare them and let the masses educate themselves.
    The discussion meeting began. When the workers compared the iron rake processed by Little Shen with the iron rakes in the business department, they all said that Little Shen's iron rake was good: it was evenly and straightly forged, smoothly filed, and even had steel embedded in it. With such an iron rake, the work efficiency would be high, and it would be great if all the iron rakes could be made like this.
    Speaking to this point, Xu Yongyuan raised several questions to the workers: Who are we making iron for? Can we make all the iron rakes as good as the one processed by Little Shen? Was Little Shen right not to sell his iron rake to Tang Yinsheng?
    The conversation turned to this point, and the workers' discussions became even more active. Some supported Little Shen, saying that Little Shen himself was a blacksmith, and no one could say that he was wrong to make a good iron rake for his lover. But some people opposed this view, believing that Little Shen was doing this for personal gain, only for himself and not for the collective; only for his lover and not for the peasants. Discussing to this point, Xu Yongyuan led everyone to reread Chairman Mao's "Serve the People," asking everyone to examine their own thoughts in accordance with the spirit of "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people.
    Chairman Mao's words were like a spring breeze blowing into everyone's hearts.
    The discussion continued, but everyone's understanding gradually became unified. Some workers used the incident that happened to Little Shen today as a mirror to see the dark spots on themselves, realizing that it was wrong to buy good goods for relatives and friends in the past. The workers said that serving the people should not be hung on the lips, written on paper, or posted on the wall, but should be used in practical actions. Our ironware cooperative should do everything possible to make good iron and produce inexpensive and high-quality agricultural tools of various kinds; otherwise, supporting agriculture and serving the people would become empty words.
    Little Shen, who had been sitting in the corner, also spoke at this time. He stood up with a red face and said: "I was wrong. I was wrong in having only the word 'me' in my heart, and I was wrong in being able to wholeheartedly for my lover but not wholeheartedly for the peasants. I must do things according to Chairman Mao's teachings in the future."
    Shen Huifang was awakened, and the masses also received a vivid education through discussion. Everyone realized that the matter of an iron rake seemed like a small matter, but it was actually a major matter related to serving the people.
    So, how should this iron rake be handled?
    "Send the iron rake to Tang Yinsheng!" This was the answer of Comrade Shen Huifang, and also the answer of all the workers of the ironware cooperative. Not only should this iron rake be sent, but also the other several iron rakes should be brought along, and the peasant brothers should be asked for their opinions in order to improve product quality and produce agricultural tools that the peasants like.
    The next afternoon, the workers elected representatives and formed a visiting group, and came to the Second Production Team of the Eleventh Brigade where Tang Yinsheng was located.
    The Second Production Team was holding a meeting of commune members. The visiting group found Tang Yinsheng and explained their intentions. Tang Yinsheng was very moved, and he refused to accept the iron rake no matter what. Xu Yongyuan persuaded him in every way, and he finally accepted it; however, in the end, he gave it to the commune member who needed the iron rake even more than him. When the peasants heard that the ironware cooperative had specially come to apologize to Tang Yinsheng because of the iron rake, they were all very moved. They enthusiastically gave their opinions on the iron rake samples brought by the workers, and praised "The style of the working class is really high!" (Attached picture)

    怎样处理这把铁耙？	张重天　陈从长
    黄昏时候。浙江慈溪县师桥铁业社的工场里，工人们早已下工了，只有青年工人沈回芳还留在那里。
    在明亮的灯光下，沈回芳正微弯着身子，拿着锉刀使劲地在锉一把铁耙。他锉了看，看了再锉，干得起劲极了。小沈为什么这么精心地侍弄这把铁耙呢？原来小沈有个未婚妻在卫前公社一个生产队里参加农业生产。前几天，她托人捎来一个口信，要小沈代她买一把双齿铁耙。小沈今天下午便买了一把，利用业余时间积极进行加工，想送给爱人一把称心如意的铁耙。
    正在这时，门外进来一个人，他轻轻地走到小沈身边，端详了一阵铁耙，赞叹道：“好铁耙！”
    小沈听到有人说话，回头一看，原来是师桥十一大队的社员唐银生。
    唐银生一眼就看上了这把铁耙，没待小沈说话，赶忙说：“这把双齿耙卖给我吧，我等着用。”小沈笑笑说：“这铁耙是好，可有主了。你要，还是到营业部去买。我们今天的成品都缴上去了。”
    唐银生说：“不瞒你说，营业部的几把我都看过了，没你这把好，我还是想要这把。”说完，拿起铁耙，就走到营业部柜台上，想开票付款。
    小沈气呼呼地追上来了：“这铁耙我不卖。”
    唐银生反问：“铁业社打的铁耙不卖给农民卖给谁？”
    这时，街上挤满了看热闹的人。其中有人不平地说：“不卖也有个不卖的原因，你该告诉人家。”
    “我这把是送给爱人的。”小沈这才吞吞吐吐地说了。
    营业员阿蛟伯看到这情景，就出来打了个圆场，说是这一把既然小沈要留给爱人，那就算了。要是唐银生对营业部里的几把看不中，可以明天再来，让小沈照样给他加工一把。唐银生无可奈何地接受了这个建议，带着一肚子意见走了。
    唐银生回去了，看热闹的人也散去了，但是事情并没有结束。当阿蛟伯把这件事向支部书记徐永元汇报后，徐永元心里翻腾得厉害。他想，类似的事情过去也曾有过，有的工人为了替亲戚朋友买铁耙，就进行“超级”加工。为什么为亲戚、朋友，就可以把活干得特别好？而给农民打的铁耙就不能打出这样好？为什么？为什么？想不尽的为什么？最后追到根上来，他觉得这就是：有的工人眼中更多地看到了我，而没有看到五亿农民！
    怎么办？将今天这件事拿到群众中去讨论讨论，提高大家的认识。让群众用毛泽东思想之矢，射自己思想之的。
    说干就干。讨论会就在今晚举行，同时建议把小沈加工的那把铁耙和营业部里留着的几把铁耙带到会上，让大家评比一下，让群众自己教育自己。
    讨论会开始了。工人们把小沈加工的那把铁耙和营业部里的铁耙一比较，都说小沈这把铁耙好：打得均匀平直，锉得光亮，而且还嵌了钢。这样的铁耙，做起活来，工作效率高，要是把把铁耙都弄成这样可就好了。
    谈到这里，徐永元便向工人们提出了几个问题：我们打铁为谁？我们能不能把所有的铁耙都打得跟小沈加工过的一样好？小沈不把自己的铁耙卖给唐银生对不对？
    话头一转到这里，工人们的议论更活跃了。有的支持小沈说，小沈自己是打铁工人，打把好铁耙送爱人，谁也不能说错。但也有人反对这种看法，认为小沈这样做是徇私，是光为个人，不为集体；光为爱人，不为农民。讨论到这里，徐永元又带领大家，重读了一遍毛主席的《为人民服务》，让大家按照：“完全”“彻底”为人民服务的精神来检查自己的思想。
    毛主席的话象一阵春风吹进了大家的心头。
    讨论继续下去，但是大家的认识已经逐渐统一了。有些工人以今天发生在小沈身上的这件事为镜子，照出了自己身上的黑点，认识到过去为亲戚朋友买好货，是不对的。工人们说，为人民服务不能挂在嘴上，写在纸上，贴在墙上，而是应该用到实际行动中去。我们铁业社就是应该千方百计地打好铁，生产出价廉物美的各式农具，否则，支援农业、为人民服务就成了一句空话。
    一直坐在角落里的小沈这时也发言了，他红着脸站起来说：“我错了。我错在心中只有一个‘我’字，我错在为爱人能全心全意，为农民不能全心全意上。我今后一定要好好按毛主席的教导办事。”
    沈回芳觉醒了，群众也通过讨论受到了一次生动的教育。大家认识到，一把铁耙的事看起来是小事，其实却是关系到为人民服务的大事。
    那么到底应该怎样来处理这把铁耙呢？
    “把铁耙给唐银生送去！”这是沈回芳同志的回答，也是铁业社全体工人的回答。不仅要把这一把铁耙送去，还要把其他几把都带去，请农民兄弟提意见，以便改进产品质量，生产出农民所喜爱的农具来。
    第二天下午，工人们就推选了代表，组成访问小组，来到了十一大队唐银生所在的第二生产队。
    第二生产队正在开社员大会。访问小组找到了唐银生，说明了来意。唐银生非常感动，他怎么也不肯收下这把铁耙。徐永元好说歹说，他才收下；但是，最后还是把它让给比他更加需要铁耙的社员了。农民们听说铁业社为了这把铁耙特地赶来向唐银生道歉时，都很感动。他们热情地为工人们带去的铁耙样品提了意见，并且称赞“工人阶级的风格真高！”（附图片）
