    Why must everything be handled by the Party Branch Secretary?
    Recently, at a meeting attended by some Party Branch Secretaries in our Lingbi County, everyone reflected that since the Eighth Plenary Session of the Tenth Central Committee of the Party, Party committees at all levels have paid more attention to the work of Party branches, but the phenomenon of the Party not managing the Party has not been completely overcome. Some commune Party committees still only focus on production and not on Party building; they only care about grain, oil, and cotton, and not about the ideological education of Party members and cadres. When the commune holds a meeting, whether it is about production, livelihood, water conservancy, inspection visits, etc., the Party Branch Secretary must attend, while the brigade leader has nothing to do. Some brigade Party Branch Secretaries said: "The commune asks the Party Branch Secretary to inspect production, they ask the Party Branch Secretary even when the villagers have domestic disputes, and when the commune Party committee holds a meeting, they call the Party Branch Secretary to report on the progress of production, discuss the production situation, and arrange production tasks, rarely mentioning the Party's organizational life and the ideological education of Party members. It seems they don't trust the brigade leader to handle production." Some brigade Party Branch Secretaries believe that in order for the Party Branch Secretary to do a good job in ideological and political work, in addition to actively arranging work and production well, the leadership methods of the commune Party committee must also be improved. Not all work should be handled by the Party Branch Secretary alone. Daily production and administrative work should be handed over to the management committee. The commune should hold meetings with the brigade leaders, assigning them tasks, so that the Party Branch Secretary can concentrate on grasping politics and doing a good job in Party branch work.
    It is hoped that these commune Party committees will quickly reverse the phenomenon of the Party not managing the Party, highlight politics, use Mao Zedong Thought to take command, and vigorously grasp Party building.

### 为什么事事都要抓支部书记呢？

    为什么事事都要抓支部书记呢？
    最近，在我们灵璧县召开的部分支部书记参加的会议上，大家反映，自从党的八届十中全会以后，各级党委对支部工作有所重视，但是，党不管党的现象仍未完全克服。有的公社党委还是只抓生产，不抓党的建设；只管粮油棉，不问党员干部的思想教育工作。公社一开会不管是生产、生活、水利、参观检查，等等，都要支部书记参加，大队长反而没事做。有的大队支部书记说：“公社检查生产找支部书记，社员夫妻吵架也找支部书记，公社党委一开会，就找支部书记去，汇报的是生产进度，讨论的是生产情况，布置的是生产任务，很少提党的组织生活和党员的思想教育。好象把生产交给大队长干就不放心。”有的大队支部书记认为：支部书记要抓好思想政治工作，除了自己积极地把工作、生产安排好外，公社党委的领导方法也要改进，不能什么工作都叫支部书记一把抓，日常生产和行政工作应交给管委会去管，要开大队长会，向他们交代任务，让支部书记能够集中精力去抓政治，做好支部工作。
    希望这些公社党委迅速扭转党不管党的现象，突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂帅，狠抓党的建设。
