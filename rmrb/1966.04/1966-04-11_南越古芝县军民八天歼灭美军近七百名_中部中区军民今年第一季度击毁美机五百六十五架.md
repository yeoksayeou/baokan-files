    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th April – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the army and people of Cu Chi County in Gia Dinh Province, South Vietnam's famous "Iron Triangle" region, annihilated nearly 700 American aggressor troops in the counter-"sweep" battles from March 29th to April 5th. They completely wiped out two companies of the Second Brigade of the American 25th Infantry Division, shot down three enemy helicopters and three F-105 jet fighters, destroyed several enemy tanks and armored vehicles, and seized a large quantity of weapons and military supplies.
    On March 29th, the Second Brigade of the American 25th Infantry Division and the Seventh Regiment of the puppet Fifth Division, under the cover of aircraft and tanks, conducted "sweeps" in Dong Phu Hoa and other villages in the southern part of Cu Chi County. The local guerrillas fiercely intercepted the enemy, annihilating 60 American aggressor troops and many puppet soldiers.
    On April 1st, the enemy again conducted "sweeps" in Phu My Hung, An Phu, and other villages in the northern part of Cu Chi County. As soon as the American aggressor troops entered this area, they were plunged into the sea of people's war. The guerrillas of various villages continuously attacked the enemy, destroying many enemy military vehicles. One guerrilla fighter killed four American soldiers with four shots. Another guerrilla fighter destroyed four enemy military vehicles with three landmines.
    At dawn on April 5th, the Liberation Army and guerrillas closely coordinated and suddenly launched an attack on the American military camp. After two hours of fierce fighting, they completely wiped out two American companies, killing and wounding more than 400 enemy soldiers in total, forcing the defeated American troops to flee in panic.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 10th April – According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the army and people of Central Trung Bo in South Vietnam shot down and destroyed a total of 565 American aircraft in the first three months of this year.
    During this period, the army and people of Central Trung Bo attacked the Da Nang, Chu Lai, An Khe, and Phu Cat airports, destroying a large number of enemy aircraft. At the same time, the army and people also shot down a large number of enemy aircraft that were providing cover for the enemy's "sweeps" and bombing and poisoning the liberated areas.
    The movement of the army and people of Central Trung Bo using rifles to shoot down airplanes has developed vigorously. The Gia Lai Province guerrillas shot down 26 enemy aircraft with rifles in three months. A guerrilla fighter in Son Tinh County, Quang Ngai Province, shot down two helicopters with sixteen bullets. In the counter-"sweep" battle on February 25th, the Quang Tri Province guerrillas shot down two American jet fighters with rifles. From mid-February to early March, the Thua Thien Province guerrillas shot down ten American aircraft with rifles in various counter-"sweep" battles and the battle to capture the A Shau American "Special Forces" barracks, including two B-57 jet fighters. The female guerrilla fighter A You of this province shot down an American helicopter with one rifle bullet on March 16th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 9th April – The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army Daily* published a commentary on the 8th, pointing out that in the face of the powerful force of the people's war in South Vietnam, America's so-called "air superiority" has been shattered.
    The commentary said that in South Vietnam, the Liberation Army does not have a single aircraft, while the American aggressors possess thousands of modern fighters and helicopters, but this cannot save the American aggressor troops from being annihilated in entire companies and battalions at the foot of Chu Pong Mountain, in the Ia Drang Valley, in Duc Hoa, Duc Hue, Cu Chi, in Bong Son, Quang Ngai, and other places.
    The commentary said that the enemy is afraid of fighting at close quarters. They hope that there is a considerable distance between the two sides' front lines. This way, they can bring their artillery and air force firepower into play. However, the Liberation Army aimed at this weakness of theirs, maneuvered troops flexibly, chose favorable opportunities, launched surprise attacks, and "grabbed the enemy by the belt and fought," thus placing the enemy in an unfavorable position, making it impossible for them to get air cover. American planes flying all over the sky not only cannot save the American aggressor troops being beaten on the ground, but are instead shot down and damaged in large numbers by the Liberation Army.
    The commentary said that for the American aggressors, there is no safe place in South Vietnam. There is also no place for American aircraft to stay in South Vietnam. They are shot down when they fly in the sky, and they cannot escape being destroyed even when they are parked at the airport. There is no way for the American bandits to ensure that their planes will not be hit by the Liberation Army's bullets, and there is no way for them to ensure that their airports will not be attacked. Similarly, there is no way for them to prevent the American, puppet, and vassal troops from being defeated and to save their complete defeat in the aggressive war they are waging in South Vietnam.

    南越古芝县军民八天歼灭美军近七百名
    中部中区军民今年第一季度击毁美机五百六十五架
    新华社河内十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方嘉定省著名的“铁三角”地区的古芝县军民在三月二十九日到四月五日的反“扫荡”战斗中，又歼灭美国侵略军近七百名，其中全歼美国第二十五步兵师第二旅两个连，击落敌直升飞机和F—105型喷气式战斗机各三架，击毁敌坦克和装甲车多辆，并缴获大批武器和军用物资。
    三月二十九日，美国第二十五步兵师的第二旅和伪军第五师的第七团在飞机和战车的掩护下，到古芝县南部的东富和等乡“扫荡”。当地游击队猛烈截击敌人，歼灭美国侵略军六十名和伪军多名。
    四月一日，敌人又到古芝县北部的富美兴、安富等乡进行“扫荡”。美国侵略军刚进入这个地区，就陷入人民战争的火海中。各乡游击队连续袭击敌人，击毁很多敌人的军车。一个游击队员四枪打死四个美国佬。另一个游击队员用三颗地雷就炸毁了敌人四辆军车。
    四月五日凌晨，解放军和游击队紧密配合，突然对美军营地发动进攻，经过两个小时的激烈战斗，全歼美军两个连，共打死、打伤敌人四百多名，迫使美军残兵败将狼狈逃窜。
    新华社河内十日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方中部中区军民在今年头三个月中，共击落、炸毁美国飞机五百六十五架。
    在这个期间，中部中区军民袭击了岘港、朱莱、安溪、符吉机场，炸毁了大量敌机。同时，军民们还击落了大批为敌人的“扫荡”作掩护和到解放区轰炸、放毒的敌机。
    中部中区军民用步枪打飞机的运动，得到了蓬勃的发展。嘉莱省游击队，在三个月中用步枪打落敌机二十六架。广义省山晶县一个游击战士，用十六发子弹打落两架直升飞机。广治省游击队在二月二十五日的反“扫荡”战斗中，用步枪击落美国喷气式战斗机两架。承天省游击队从二月中旬到三月初，在各次反“扫荡”和攻克阿绍美国“特种部队”兵营的战斗中，用步枪击落成十架美国飞机，其中包括B—57型喷气式战斗机两架。这个省的女游击战士阿由，在三月十六日用一发步枪子弹打落美国直升飞机一架。
    新华社河内九日电　越南《人民军队报》八日发表评论指出，在越南南方人民战争的强大威力面前，美国的所谓“空中优势”被粉碎了。
    评论说，在越南南方，解放军没有一架飞机，而美国侵略者却拥有成千架现代化的战斗机和直升飞机，但是，这也挽救不了美国侵略军整连、整营地在朱邦山麓，在德浪河谷，在德和、德惠、古芝，在蓬山，广义等地遭到歼灭。
    评论说，敌人害怕打近战。他们希望双方的战线有一段相当远的距离。这样就可以发挥他们的炮兵和空军的火力。然而，解放军对准他们的这个弱点，机动灵活地运动军队，选择有利时机，发动突然进攻，“紧紧地抓住敌人的腰带打”，这样就把敌人置于不利的地位，使他们无法得到空军的掩护。美国飞机满天飞，不但救不了在地面挨打的美国侵略军，反而被解放军大量击落和击伤。
    评论说，对于美国侵略者来说，在越南南方没有一块安全的地方。在越南南方也同样没有美国飞机容身之所。它们在天上飞时被击落，停放在机场上也逃避不了被击毁。美国强盗没有什么办法可以保证它的飞机不吃解放军的子弹，也没有什么办法可以保证它的机场不遭到袭击。同样，它也没有什么办法可以使美军、伪军和仆从军不打败仗和挽救它们在越南南方进行的侵略战争的彻底失败。
