    Vowing to Oppose Johnson's War of Aggression in Vietnam
    Another American Youth Attempts Self-Immolation and is Arrested
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 11th: Another American youth has used self-immolation to express their irreconcilable opposition to the government's heinous crimes of aggression in Vietnam. However, he was met with obstruction and persecution by the police.
    This youth, named Arthur Zinner, is a student at Boston University. On the morning of the 10th, he arrived in front of the White House, poured two bottles of gasoline he brought with him onto his body, and prepared to set himself on fire. At this moment, Washington police and secret agents rushed over, snatched away his gasoline bottles and matches, and immediately arrested him, taking him away in a police car. Zinner stated that his self-immolation was to oppose American involvement in the Vietnam War; prior to this, he had written several letters to President Johnson, protesting the policies promoted by the United States in Vietnam.

    誓死反对约翰逊侵越战争
    美国又一青年自焚被逮捕
    据新华社十一日讯　华盛顿消息：又一个美国青年用自焚来表示同政府侵略越南的滔天罪行誓不两立。但是，他受到了警察的阻拦和迫害。
    这个青年名叫阿瑟·津纳，是波士顿大学的学生。他在十日上午来到白宫前面，把带来的两瓶汽油往身上倒，准备点火自焚。这时，华盛顿的警察和密探匆匆赶来，夺走他的汽油瓶子和火柴，并且立刻把他抓起来，用警车带走。津纳表示：他自焚是为了反对美国卷入越南战争；在这以前，他已经写过好几封信给总统约翰逊，抗议美国在越南推行的政策。
