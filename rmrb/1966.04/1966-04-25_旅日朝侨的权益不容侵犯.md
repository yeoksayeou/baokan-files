    The Rights of Korean Residents in Japan Must Not Be Infringed
    Commentator of this newspaper
    The Sato government of Japan is drafting a so-called "Amendment to the School Education Law" aimed at Korean residents in Japan, attempting to deprive Korean residents of their right to receive democratic national education.
    This reactionary measure by the Sato government is a new step in its preparation for further persecuting Korean residents in Japan. Since the Japanese authorities signed the "Japan-South Korea Basic Treaty" with the Park Chung-hee clique of South Korea last year, they have been continuously intensifying their persecution of Korean residents in Japan. It attempts to force Korean residents in Japan to adopt "South Korean nationality" through the illegal "Agreement on the Legal Status of Korean Residents in Japan." It has also dispatched police and thugs to attack villages where Korean residents live and institutions affiliated with the "General Association of Korean Residents in Japan." Now, it intends to interfere with the democratic national education of Korean residents, attempting to change the patriotic stance of Korean residents and obstruct their struggle against U.S. imperialism's occupation of South Korea. These sinful acts and sinister plots of the Sato government are a brutal trampling on the rights enjoyed by citizens of an independent country.
    The Sato government's persecution of Korean residents in Japan is also part of its implementation of fascist tyranny within Japan. The Sato government's infringement of the basic human rights of Korean citizens in Japan is linked to its attack on the national and democratic rights of the Japanese people. Precisely because of this, many political parties and democratic groups in Japan also stand with Korean residents in Japan, resolutely opposing this reactionary measure by the Sato government.
    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on April 16, protesting the Sato government's trampling on the democratic national education rights of Korean citizens in Japan and demanding that the Japanese authorities immediately cease all forms of discrimination and persecution against them. The Chinese people fully support this solemn position and legitimate demand of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Sato government must effectively guarantee that Korean residents in Japan enjoy all the rights that foreigners in Japan should enjoy and immediately cease the sinful activities of persecuting Korean residents in Japan.

    旅日朝侨的权益不容侵犯	本报评论员
    日本佐藤政府正在制订一项针对旅日朝鲜侨民的所谓“学校教育法修改案”，企图剥夺朝鲜侨民接受民主民族教育的权利。
    佐藤政府的这一反动措施，是它准备进一步迫害旅日朝侨的一个新步骤。日本当局去年同南朝鲜朴正熙集团签订了“日韩基本条约”以后，就不断加紧对旅日朝侨的迫害。它企图通过非法的“旅日朝侨法律地位协定”，强迫旅日朝侨归入“韩国国籍”，它还派遣警察和暴徒，袭击朝鲜侨民聚居的村庄和“旅日朝鲜人总联合会”所属的机构。现在，它又打算干涉朝鲜侨民接受民主民族教育，妄图改变朝鲜侨民的爱国立场，阻挠他们反对美帝国主义霸占南朝鲜的斗争。佐藤政府的这些罪恶行径和阴险图谋，是对一个独立国家的国民所享有的权利的粗暴蹂躏。
    佐藤政府对旅日朝侨的迫害，也是它在日本国内推行法西斯暴政的一部分。佐藤政府对旅日朝鲜公民基本人权的侵犯，是同它对日本人民的民族民主权利的进攻联系在一起的。正是因为这样，日本的许多政党和民主团体也同旅日朝侨站在一起，坚决反对佐藤政府的这一反动措施。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府外务省四月十六日发表声明，抗议佐藤政府践踏旅日朝鲜公民的民主民族教育权利，要求日本当局立即停止对他们的各种歧视和迫害。中国人民完全支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的这种严正立场和正当要求。佐藤政府必须切实保障旅日朝侨享受外国人在日本应该享受的一切权利，立即停止迫害旅日朝侨的罪恶活动。
