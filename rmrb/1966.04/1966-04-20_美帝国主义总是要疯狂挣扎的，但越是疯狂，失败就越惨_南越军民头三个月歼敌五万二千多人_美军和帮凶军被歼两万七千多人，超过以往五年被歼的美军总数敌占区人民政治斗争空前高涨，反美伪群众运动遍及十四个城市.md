    U.S. Imperialism is Always Doomed to Frantic Struggles, But the More Frantic it Becomes, the More Miserable its Defeat Will Be
    South Vietnamese Army and People Annihilate More Than 52,000 Enemies in the First Three Months
    More Than 27,000 U.S. Troops and Accomplice Troops Annihilated, Exceeding the Total Number of U.S. Troops Annihilated in the Previous Five Years. Political Struggle of People in Enemy-Occupied Areas Reaches Unprecedented Heights, Anti-U.S. Puppet Mass Movements Sweep 14 Cities
    Editor's Note: In the first quarter of this year, the heroic South Vietnamese army and people staged another magnificent and heroic drama on the stage of people's war. They crushed a series of "offensives" by the U.S. invading army, annihilated more than 50,000 enemies, and achieved a brilliant victory.
    This new victory proves that no matter how frantically the U.S. aggressors struggle, no matter what kind of weapons and troop "advantages" they bring out, they cannot reverse the situation of being passively beaten. On the contrary, the larger the scale of its military "sweeps," the more its active forces are annihilated, the more its positions shrink, the more isolated its situation becomes, and the deeper it sinks into the encirclement of the people's anti-U.S. puppet struggle on the political front. In short, everything goes against the wishes of the U.S. aggressors.
    Now, U.S. imperialism is constantly increasing its troops in South Vietnam, intensifying its barbaric bombing of North Vietnam, and while continuing to engage in war blackmail, it is gradually moving towards new adventures to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. But what else can this lead to other than provoking even stronger counterattacks from the people of the South and the North of Vietnam, and suffering even heavier defeats? The glorious victory of the South Vietnamese people in the first three months of this year is a powerful warning to U.S. imperialism.
    Hanoi, April 19 (Xinhua News Agency) - The South Vietnam Liberation Press Agency issued a communique on the 17th regarding the great achievements made by the people of South Vietnam in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation in the first three months of this year, stating that in the first three months of this year, the U.S. aggressors exhausted all means in a vain attempt to regain the initiative they had lost, but they suffered a crushing defeat and fell into an even more passive situation. The South Vietnamese army and people shattered the U.S. invading army's "dry season offensive" plot, maintained the initiative on the battlefield, and achieved a great victory.
    The communique stated that, according to incomplete statistics, the South Vietnamese army and people annihilated a total of 52,068 enemies in the first three months of this year, nearly doubling the number in the first three months of 1965. Among the annihilated enemies were 27,834 U.S. aggressors and accomplice troops, exceeding the total number of U.S. troops annihilated in the five years from 1961 to 1965, which was 22,597. Including deserters and disintegrated enemy troops, the total number of enemy troops who lost their combat effectiveness in these three months reached more than 67,000.
    In these three months, the South Vietnamese army and people completely annihilated 15 enemy battalions, including 9 U.S. battalions, close to the total number of U.S. entire battalions annihilated in the entire year of 1965; completely annihilated 26 U.S. companies, more than doubling the total number of U.S. entire companies annihilated in the entire year of 1965 (12 companies). The South Vietnamese army and people also shot down and destroyed 940 enemy aircraft of various types, destroyed more than 600 enemy military vehicles, including nearly 300 tanks and armored vehicles; sank and destroyed 30 enemy warships, including oil tankers, burned down a large gasoline depot storing 700 barrels of gasoline and 1,000 tons of other oil, and also burned down more than 2 million liters of gasoline and destroyed two gasoline warehouses; seized a large number of weapons, ammunition, nine tanks, and many other military vehicles.
    The communique stated that all the "sweeps" of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys suffered crushing defeats. The purpose of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys in launching this offensive was to attempt to defend the areas surrounding the cities and various bases, and to clear the lines of communication. However, not only was this purpose not achieved, but their strength was greatly eliminated. In many areas, after conducting "sweeps," they were forced to withdraw from many important strongholds and outposts, and the scope of their control was further reduced. On the other hand, our army continuously took the initiative to attack, seeking out the Americans to annihilate and the puppet troops to strike, winning every battle. Our army and people even stormed the enemy's nests, attacking the Victoria Hotel in Saigon and the airports of An Khe, Chu Lai, Da Lat, and Tan Son Nhut. Not only could the enemy not destroy our base areas, but our army also attacked the enemy's rear, making no rear safe for the enemy. The plan of the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys to "regain the initiative" in the dry season has been completely bankrupted.
    The communique pointed out that the great victories of the South Vietnamese army and people in the winter of 1965 and the first three months of this year are of great significance. Now, the facts have shown that air power and weapons superiority cannot save the U.S. invading army, and troop superiority cannot prevent them from being defeated. In the dry season, the U.S. aggressors have thrown out their new trump card - U.S. mobile forces. However, the Liberation Army has the ability to fight large-scale annihilation battles, completely annihilating a battalion of U.S. troops, or even several battalions, in one battle. Several U.S. mobile divisions not only failed to achieve anything, but also suffered heavy losses, and no unit of all these U.S. divisions was able to remain intact. Several thousand South Korean accomplice troops were also annihilated, and a battalion of Australians was almost completely wiped out.
    The communique pointed out that U.S. imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat this dry season, but it is still not reconciled. It is plotting to send more troops to the South Vietnamese battlefield. But no matter how many troops it sends, it can only increase the scale of its defeat along with the expansion of the war.
    The communique stated that the strength of the South Vietnamese army and people has made a leap forward in the past period. After competing with the enemy in the dry season, the South Vietnamese People's Liberation Armed Forces are stronger than before.
    The communique said that a feature of the first three months of this year is that guerrilla warfare has developed vigorously and widely, cooperating very closely with the continuous offensives of the main forces against the enemy. In addition to counter-"sweeping" and ambush warfare, the guerrillas and local troops have also conducted many surprise attacks, attacking enemy aircraft, cutting enemy lines of communication, and surrounding and attacking enemy strongholds. In the first three months of this year, guerrilla activities not only developed in areas where the enemy and we confronted each other, but also expanded to areas controlled by the enemy. The competition to "seek out the Americans to annihilate and the puppet troops to strike" has formed a nationwide movement to kill the enemy.
    The communique stated that the major victories of the South Vietnamese army and people in annihilating the enemy's active forces have caused extreme panic in the puppet army ranks. In addition, coupled with the propaganda of the South Vietnamese army and people to the puppet army, the desertion of the puppet army is increasing day by day. According to incomplete statistics, about 15,000 puppet soldiers have deserted in the past three months. Some units deserted as entire companies, and many puppet army units refused to fight. Some soldiers even turned their guns and killed the puppet officers who had committed many evils, and went over to the people with their weapons. In particular, the uprising of officers and soldiers of the puppet army's First Armored Regiment had a great impact on the puppet army. The communique said that in the past three months, political struggle, in coordination with armed struggle, has developed vigorously. Rural compatriots have waged resolute struggles against the enemy's "pacification" plot, thwarting their "pacification" plan. Urban compatriots have continued to struggle for the realization of various democratic rights and the improvement of people's lives. At the same time, taking advantage of the opportunity of the U.S. running dogs tearing at each other, the urban people have also risen up to struggle, demanding the expulsion of the U.S. aggressors and the overthrow of the Nguyen Van Thieu-Nguyen Cao Ky running dog clique. The struggles of the rural and urban people, in coordination with the continuous major victories achieved on various battlefields, have made the puppet army and the puppet regime even more prone to disintegration.
    The communique said that the rural compatriots have waged resolute and heroic struggles, shattering the "pacification" plot of the U.S. bandits and their running dogs. All the enemy's barbaric persecution actions and cunning deception and bribery methods have not brought them any results. They organized demonstrations and went to the enemy's strongholds to protest against the enemy's use of aircraft and artillery to slaughter the people, demanding that the U.S. bandits pay for their lives and demanding that the U.S. guys get out. According to incomplete statistics, in the past three months, 1.5 million people-times have engaged in face-to-face struggles with the enemy.
    The communique said that the people in the cities of the enemy-occupied areas have also launched extensive struggles against the enemy's conscription, against the demolition of houses and the seizure of land, against enemy atrocities, demanding wage increases, and demanding that the United States stop the war of aggression. Since March of this year, the people of various cities have taken advantage of the opportunity of the U.S. running dog clique's internal infighting to launch a widespread and fierce mass movement against the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs. This mass movement has spread to 14 cities in the South.
    The communique said that in the first three months of this year, the movement of the world's people to support the Vietnamese people in resisting U.S. aggression has taken another step forward. In the United States, the movement to support the Vietnamese people and oppose the U.S. government's policy of aggression is also developing. The people of the world are denouncing U.S. President Johnson's "peace talks" fraud and actively supporting the five-point statement of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front issued in March 1965. The support of the people of the world for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance has made the Vietnamese people even more determined to win the complete victory of the sacred war of resistance.

    美帝国主义总是要疯狂挣扎的，但越是疯狂，失败就越惨
    南越军民头三个月歼敌五万二千多人
    美军和帮凶军被歼两万七千多人，超过以往五年被歼的美军总数敌占区人民政治斗争空前高涨，反美伪群众运动遍及十四个城市
    编者按：今年第一季度，英雄的南越军民，又在人民战争的舞台上，演了一出威武雄壮的活剧。他们粉碎了美国侵略军的一系列“攻势”，歼敌五万多人，取得了辉煌的胜利。
    这一新的胜利证明，美国侵略者不管怎样疯狂挣扎，掏出了怎样的武器和兵力“优势”，都扭转不了被动挨打的局面。相反地，它的军事“扫荡”规模越大，有生力量被歼就越多，阵地就越缩小，处境就越孤立，在政治战线上也就更深地陷于人民反美伪斗争的包围中。总之，一切都走向美国侵略者愿望的反面。
    现在，美帝国主义正在不断增兵南越，加强对越南北方的野蛮轰炸，一面继续进行战争讹诈，一面逐步走向扩大侵越战争的新冒险。但这除了引起南方人民和越南北方更强大的反击，使自己遭到更沉重的失败以外，还能有别的什么结果呢？南越人民今年头三个月的辉煌胜利，就是对美帝国主义的有力警告。
    新华社河内十九日电　越南南方解放通讯社十七日就越南南方人民在今年头三个月的抗美救国斗争中取得的巨大成绩发表公报说，在今年头三个月里，美国侵略者竭尽全力妄图夺回已失去的主动权，但是它遭到了惨败，陷于更加被动的局面。越南南方军民粉碎了美国侵略军的“旱季攻势”阴谋，保持了战场上的主动权，取得了伟大的胜利。
    公报说，据不完全统计，越南南方军民今年头三个月共歼灭敌人五万二千零六十八名，比一九六五年头三个月增加近一倍。在被歼灭的敌人中有美国侵略者和帮凶军二万七千八百三十四名，比从一九六一年到一九六五年的五年中歼灭美军的总数二万二千五百九十七名还要多。如果包括开小差和瓦解的敌军在内，这三个月中丧失战斗力的敌军总数共达六万七千多人。
    在这三个月里，越南南方军民共全歼敌人十五个营，其中有美军九个营，接近于一九六五年全年歼灭美军整营的总数；全歼美军二十六个连，比一九六五年全年全歼美军整连的总数（十二个连）增加一倍多。越南南方军民还击落和击毁各种类型的敌机九百四十架，击毁敌人军车六百多辆，其中有各种坦克和装甲车近三百辆；击沉和击毁包括油船在内的敌战船三十艘，烧毁敌人一个贮藏着七百桶汽油和一千吨其他油料的大汽油库，另外还烧毁两百多万公升汽油和摧毁两个汽油仓库；缴获大批武器、弹药、九辆坦克和其他许多军车。
    公报说，美国侵略者及其走狗的所有各次“扫荡”都遭到了惨败。美国侵略者及其走狗发动这个攻势的目的是企图保卫城市周围地区和各个基地，打通交通线。但是，这个目的不仅没有达到，它们的力量反而被大量消灭。在许多地区，它们在进行“扫荡”之后。被迫撤出许多重要据点、哨所，它们所控制的范围更加缩小，另一方面，我军不断地主动进攻，找美国佬歼、找伪军打，打一仗，胜一仗。我们军民甚至直捣敌人的巢穴，袭击西贡维多利亚饭店和安溪、朱莱、大叻、新山一等机场。敌人不仅破坏不了我们的根据地，而我军却攻进敌人的后方，使敌人没有一个后方可以说是安全的。美国侵略者及其走狗企图在旱季中“夺回主动权”的计划已遭到彻底破产。
    公报指出，越南南方军民在一九六五年冬天和今年头三个月的巨大胜利具有重大意义。现在，事实已经表明，空军和武器优势拯救不了美国侵略军，兵力优势也不能使它们避免失败。在旱季中，美国侵略者已抛出了它的新王牌——美国机动力量。但是，解放军有能力打大规模的歼灭战，在一次战斗中全歼一个营美军，甚至几个营。美国的几个机动师不仅搞不出什么名堂来，反而遭到重大损失，美国所有这些师，都没有一个单位能够保持完整。南朝鲜帮凶军也被歼几千人、澳大利亚的一个营也差不多被全部消灭。
    公报指出，美帝国主义已在这个旱季遭到了惨败，但是仍然不甘心。它正在阴谋再向越南南方战场增兵。但是不管它增派多少兵，也只能是随着战争规模的扩大，它的失败的规模也增加罢了。
    公报说，越南南方军民的力量在过去期间已有了飞跃的发展。在旱季同敌人较量以后，越南南方解放武装力量比以前更加强大了。
    公报说，今年头三个月的一个特点是，游击战争已蓬勃和广泛地发展，同主力部队的连续进攻敌人配合得非常密切。除了反“扫荡”、打伏击战以外，游击队和地方部队还进行了多次袭击战，打敌人的飞机，切断敌人的交通线，包围和进攻敌军据点。在今年头三个月，游击队的活动不仅在敌我相峙地区得到发展，而且还扩大到敌人控制的地区。“找美国佬歼、找伪军打”的竞赛运动，已经形成一个全军全民的杀敌运动。
    公报说，越南南方军民歼灭美伪军有生力量的重大胜利使得伪军队伍极度恐慌，再加上南方军民对伪军的宣传，因此伪军开小差的日益增加。据不完全统计，三个月来就有约一万五千名伪军士兵开小差。有的单位是整连开小差，许多伪军单位拒绝去打仗。还有一些士兵掉转枪口打死作恶多端的伪军官，携带武器投向人民。特别是伪军第一装甲团的官兵们的起义，在伪军中起很大的影响。公报说，在过去的三个月中，同武装斗争配合着的政治斗争蓬勃发展。农村同胞为反对敌人的“绥靖”阴谋而进行坚决的斗争，挫败了它们的“绥靖”计划，城市同胞为要求实现各种民主权利和改善人民生活而继续斗争。同时，趁着美国走狗互相嘶咬的机会，城市人民还奋起斗争，要求赶走美国侵略者，推翻阮文绍—阮高其走狗集团。农村和城市人民的斗争配合着各个战场上接连取得的重大胜利，使伪军和伪政权更加趋于瓦解。
    公报说，农村的同胞进行了坚决和英勇的斗争，粉碎了美国强盗及其走狗的“绥靖”阴谋。敌人的一切野蛮迫害行动和狡猾的欺骗收买手段都没有给它们带来任何结果。他们组织示威斗争，跑到敌人的据点去抗议敌人用飞机大炮残杀人民，要美国强盗偿命，要美国佬滚回去，据不完全统计，在过去三个月中有一百五十万人次同敌人进行了面对面的斗争。
    公报说，敌占区城市人民也广泛展开了斗争，反对敌人抓兵，反对拆毁民房和强占土地，反对敌人暴行，要求增加工资，要求美国停止侵略战争。今年三月以来，各城市的人民趁着美国走狗集团内部互相倾轧的机会掀起了一个反对美国侵略者及其走狗的广泛和激烈的群众运动。这个群众运动已遍及南方十四个城市。
    公报说，在今年头三个月中，世界人民支持越南人民抗击美国侵略者的运动又向前跨进了一步。在美国，支持越南人民、反对美国政府侵略政策的运动也在向前发展。世界人民都唾骂美国总统约翰逊的“和平讨论”骗局，积极支持越南南方民族解放阵线一九六五年三月发表的五点声明的立场。世界人民对越南人民的抗战的支持使得越南人民更加决心夺取神圣的抗战事业的完全胜利。
