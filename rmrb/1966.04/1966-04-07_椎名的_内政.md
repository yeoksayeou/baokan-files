    Shina, the Japanese Foreign Minister, attacked China for organizing the Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Grand Rally, calling it a "serious interference in (Japan's) internal affairs." The reason given was that the Grand Rally made resolutions against U.S. imperialism and in support of the Chinese people's liberation of Taiwan.
    That Chinese and Japanese youth expressed their determination to resolutely oppose the common enemy of U.S. imperialism becoming interference in Japan's internal affairs is truly strange. There is only one explanation: Japan's "internal affairs" are the "external affairs" of the United States. As for the Chinese people liberating their own territory of Taiwan, that is entirely China's internal affair. On this issue, it is precisely the Japanese government that has seriously interfered in China's internal affairs.
    Shina's absurd remarks actually show that the Sato government intends to use "internal affairs" as a means to obstruct friendly exchanges between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.

    椎名的“内政”
    日本外务大臣椎名攻击中国组织中日青年友好大联欢是“严重干涉（日本）内政。”理由是：大联欢作出了反对美帝国主义和支援中国人民解放台湾的决议。
    中日两国青年表示要坚决反对美帝国主义这个共同的敌人，就成了干涉日本的内政，这实在是奇闻。只能有一种解释：日本的“内政”就是美国的“外政”。至于说到中国人民要解放自己的领土台湾，那完全是中国的内政。在这个问题上，正是日本政府对中国的内政进行了严重的干涉。
    椎名大放厥词，实际上表明佐藤政府打算利用“内政”手段来阻挠中日两国人民的友好交往罢了。
