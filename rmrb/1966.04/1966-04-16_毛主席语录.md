    Quotations from Chairman Mao
    “The socialist transformation of our country’s more than five hundred million peasants is such an earth-shaking undertaking that it cannot occur in a calm and tranquil environment. It requires us Communists to carry out patient, vivid, and easily understood propaganda and educational work to the broad masses of peasants who are burdened with the baggage of the old system.” Foreword to the book "The Socialist Upsurge in China's Countryside"

    毛主席语录
    “使我国五亿多农民实行社会主义改造这样一种惊天动地的事业，不可能是在一种风平浪静的情况下出现的，它要求我们共产党人向着背上背着旧制度包袱的广大的农民群众，进行耐心的生动的容易被他们理解的宣传教育工作。”《中国农村的社会主义高潮》一书按语
