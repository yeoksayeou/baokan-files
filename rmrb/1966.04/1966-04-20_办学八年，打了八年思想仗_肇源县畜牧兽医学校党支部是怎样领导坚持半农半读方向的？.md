    Editor's Note: Political work is the lifeline of all work. Emphasizing politics and having Mao Zedong Thought take the lead ensures that our work has the correct direction. Once the direction is settled, other problems become easier to solve. Today's article about the Zhaoyuan County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School party branch's persistence in the half-farm, half-study direction vividly illustrates this truth once again.

    The new educational system of half-work half-study and half-farm half-study is a new thing. To make this new thing grow healthily, there are many problems, such as teachers, teaching materials, teaching methods, labor bases, etc., that need to be solved. However, the most important, most fundamental, and first thing that needs to be solved is the issue of the direction of schooling. Only by holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the principle of putting politics in command, and raising the political consciousness of the vast majority of educators and teachers, so that everyone fully understands the great strategic significance of the half-work half-study and half-farm half-study educational system, promoting proletarian educational thinking, and eliminating bourgeois educational thinking, can such schools be truly run well.

    Isn't this precisely the case with Zhaoyuan County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School? The main reason they have achieved such great success is not because of equipment or teaching materials, but because of Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought enables them to understand how to make revolution on the educational front and how to blaze a path for the proletariat to run schools. In this way, material difficulties are gradually overcome, and problems such as teaching methods and teaching materials are gradually solved.

    Commanding everything with Mao Zedong Thought guarantees that we will be victorious in everything we do. This is true for industrial production, agricultural production, and the same is true for cultural and educational undertakings.

    Zhaoyuan County Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School is a red flag on the half-farm, half-study educational front. Since its establishment in 1958, it has always adhered to the direction of half-farm half-study, with teachers being half-farmers half-teachers, and students being half-farmers half-students. For eight years, it has basically maintained a schedule of six months of teaching, five months of labor, and one month of vacation each year.

    This school conscientiously adheres to half-farm half-study, cultivating a group of new-type laborers who are both red and expert, and proficient in both literary and martial skills. They have successively trained 195 graduates of one, two, and four-year programs. Among them, some joined the commune's animal husbandry and veterinary prevention stations, and most returned to the teams to become members. In their production or work posts, they always adhere to half-farming half-medicine. Many graduates who return to the team to participate in production are both good commune members and disease prevention personnel or veterinarians. The masses praise them: "When they pick up a hoe, they are farmers, and when they pick up a syringe, they are veterinarians." Now, if the livestock of the production teams or commune members in this county get sick, or need to castrate pigs or geld horses, etc., it can be solved locally in the village. This not only reduces the economic burden on the commune members and production teams, but also makes the prevention and eradication of livestock diseases more timely.

    The First Ideological Battle: Understanding What Revolution Is
    The deepest understanding of this school's party branch is that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way and constantly carrying out ideological struggle can we constantly implement revolution. The eight years of schooling are actually eight years of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in a living way, and eight years of struggle between correct schooling ideas and various incorrect schooling ideas.

    In the spring of 1958, when the county party committee decided to establish this school, it clearly put forward two instructions: first, to train animal husbandry and veterinary personnel needed in rural areas; second, to rely on self-reliance and frugality in running the school and not ask the state for money. The county party committee transferred Comrade Pei Jingchun, the former deputy secretary of the township party committee, to serve as the secretary of the school party branch.

    In mid-April, this party branch secretary, who had been a hired laborer for five years in the old society and only attended school for two months, came to the school with three copies of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," two teachers who had just graduated from secondary vocational schools, two teachers who had just been transferred from full-time schools, and more than thirty students. The school had eleven dilapidated cowsheds, located on a boundless grassland, with three feet of cow dung inside the sheds. Desks, benches, textbooks, blackboards, chalk - there was nothing. Faced with this situation, some teachers and students wavered. Some teachers said: "Why insist on running a school in this desolate grassland? It's impossible!" Some teachers said: "What self-reliance? This is overestimating ourselves!" A few students wanted to withdraw from school and go home before even unpacking their bedding. One student left the next day. Comrade Pei Jingchun thought: What is this suffering! It's much better than my days as a hired hand. He advocated doing everything possible to overcome difficulties and run the school.

    After learning about this situation, the county party committee immediately mobilized organs and schools to provide as much support as possible with desks, benches, and textbooks, and at the same time convened a meeting of the standing committee of the county party committee to discuss this issue. They unanimously believed that Comrade Mao Zedong taught us that our country was originally "poor and blank." Because of "poverty" and "blankness", we must make revolution. To make revolution, we must rely on self-reliance and not be afraid of hardship. Moreover, the "bitterer" the environment, the more students will understand the suffering of the people. Therefore, the county party committee firmly advocated running the school well and instructed the school party branch to lead all teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's works well and arm everyone's minds.

    The decision of the county party committee encouraged the party branch's confidence in overcoming difficulties. The party branch decided to mobilize all teachers and students to create the school with their own hands. Comrade Pei Jingchun, along with everyone else, cleaned up cow dung and renovated the school buildings during the day. In the early morning and evening, he would read articles such as "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Serve the People," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune" to everyone, reading and discussing, and discussing and reading. In conjunction with studying Chairman Mao's works, the party branch also came up with a topic: What are we here to do? to let everyone discuss. At first, there were different opinions. Teachers said: I am here to teach students to read and write; administrators said: I am here to manage life; students said: I am here to study veterinary medicine. When everyone read in Chairman Mao's works that "We have all come together from every corner of the country for a common revolutionary objective," many people checked their own thoughts and said: Although our specific work is different, whether it is teaching, managing life, or studying, aren't we all for a common purpose - to cultivate animal husbandry and veterinary talents for our new socialist countryside and to serve the broad masses of farmers? Isn't this revolution? More people said: Since we are here to make revolution, we cannot be afraid of hardship and must overcome the current difficulties.

    Words are not clear unless spoken, and lamps do not shine unless turned up. Mao Zedong Thought broadened people's minds and brightened their eyes. The teachers who had previously wavered said: I'm not afraid of great difficulties, but I'm afraid of having poor thoughts. No matter how many difficulties there are, with revolutionary ideas, we are not afraid of anything.

    With revolutionary ideas, there are revolutionary methods. The eleven cowsheds served as classrooms during class, canteens during meals, and dormitories during sleep. Without desks and benches, students sat on the ground or on their backpacks to attend classes. When there was a shortage of grain and vegetables, the branch secretary and branch committee members led all the teachers and students to reclaim wasteland on the grassland and plant crops and vegetables. In the autumn, when the number of teachers and students increased, the branch secretary, branch committee members, and all eight teachers and eighty-nine students went to the grassland to cut sheep grass, working for more than a month, leaving the several thousand hectares of grassland clean. This alone brought in more than 50,000 yuan. In this way, relying on the income earned through their own labor, they built thirty-four earthen flat-roofed houses for the school, added one hundred and twenty-four sets of desks and chairs, and bought more than four thousand books. At the end of the year, after the final settlement, there was still a surplus of more than 20,000 yuan.

    Constantly Fighting Ideological Battles, Implementing Teacher Laborization
    The road of revolution is always difficult and tortuous. Winning the first ideological battle was only the beginning of their work. As a party organization of a half-farm half-study school, one must never be satisfied with the victory of the first battle. They realized that only by constantly winning ideological battles can we constantly carry out educational revolution.

    After the initial solution of material living difficulties, strengthening teaching work became an important task. How to strengthen it? Some people said: At the beginning, the school had nothing, and without labor, the school could not be established; now that it has been established, labor should be reduced, and we should concentrate our efforts on teaching. Some teachers believed that studying and laboring at the same time made the school not like a school, and the reclamation team not like a reclamation team. They advocated running a full-time animal husbandry and veterinary school. At that time, although the school party branch did not have as clear an understanding as it does now that adhering to studying and laboring at the same time could cultivate new-type laborers with socialist consciousness, both red and expert, and able to engage in both physical and mental labor, they were clear on a few points. First, they conscientiously studied Chairman Mao's instructions: Our educational policy should enable those receiving an education to develop morally, intellectually, and physically, and to become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness; second, the county party committee repeatedly instructed that we should rely on self-reliance, run the school through labor, and the students trained should be able to return to the countryside; third, the party branch secretary, Pei Jingchun, was born and raised in the countryside and knew that the production teams and commune members welcomed veterinarians who were unpretentious and cared about the production and life of the masses. To achieve these requirements, students could not be separated from productive labor during their studies. At that time, the party branch made a decision: the direction of half-farm half-study cannot be shaken, and specific issues can be discussed. The county party committee supported this decision and instructed the party branch to turn the party's decision into the actual actions of all teachers and students.

    The school party branch, on the one hand, conveyed the instructions of the county party committee, and once again organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the party's educational policy, and on the other hand, invited the director of the county livestock farm, veteran veterinarians, and veteran feeders and herders from the production teams to jointly study where the students would go after graduation? What will they do? How can students learn well, learn quickly, and learn usefully?

    The problem of understanding was solved, but to truly adhere to the direction of half-farm half-study, the key lay in whether the teachers could truly adhere to half-farming half-teaching and truly realize laborization in their actual actions. The school party branch believed that the most effective way to achieve laborization among teachers was for the branch secretary, branch committee members, and party members to take the lead. Over the years, party branch secretary Pei Jingchun, party member vice-principal Liu Ke, and other party members went where the work was difficult and heavy. Every autumn, the continuous month-long work of cutting sheep grass and reeds on the grassland was the heaviest and most tiring labor. Pei Jingchun and Liu Ke always ate, lived, and labored with other teachers and students. In 1959, when cutting sheep grass, some teachers and students didn't know how, so Pei Jingchun held their hands and taught them one by one. At night, when the teachers and students were resting, Pei Jingchun would quietly sharpen the knives that everyone had used all day, making them sharp and bright. The autumn nights on the grassland were full of mosquitoes. Pei Jingchun, afraid that the teachers and students would not sleep well at night, lit a fire to smoke out the mosquitoes. Late at night, unwilling to wake everyone up in the grass shed, he quietly crawled under a pile of grass and slept in the open. In 1964, when cutting grass in Jiangwan, Pei Jingchun and the branch committee members and party members worked where the grass was tall and thick. Several freshman classes had just entered the school when they mistook this nearly half-century-old secretary for an "old worker" and praised him affectionately: "Our school's old worker is so good!" This silent command from the branch secretary, branch committee members, and party members silently infected other teachers. Some teachers who had just come here and felt unaccustomed to labor slowly changed under the subtle influence. Ma Changbao, a mathematics teacher, did not want to participate in labor when he was first transferred here a few years ago. He secretly studied university mathematics courses, preparing to become a famous mathematics teacher in a full-time middle school in the future. However, under the influence of the branch secretary and party members, this young man not only actively participated in various labor activities, but also examined his personal ambition of becoming famous and determined to work here for the rest of his life. For a period of time, he was transferred to a full-time school due to work needs. He felt that there was too little labor there and was not used to it, so he asked to be transferred back. The county party committee considered his request and transferred him back.

    We Must Carry the Revolution Through to the End
    It seemed that the issue of teacher laborization in this school had been resolved, and there was no problem with adhering to the direction of half-farm half-study. But in reality, the idea of ​​belittling labor is deeply rooted in some people's minds. If it is solved today, it will still sprout tomorrow under new climate and soil conditions. The party organization of the half-farm half-study school should be good at grasping the changing situation and repeatedly educating.

    In the spring of 1964, in order to ensure that students could attend school nearby, the county party committee moved the school to the former site of the Heilongjiang Province Wildlife Breeding Farm - Oulima Village. As the school's environment was renewed, the thinking of some teachers began to change again. Some teachers said: This time it will be changed to a national technical secondary school, and there is no need for half-farm half-study. Some students wrote "Songhua River Second Branch" on the walls in the classroom; even some teachers' spouses were dissatisfied when they saw that the school still insisted on laboring and studying at the same time, saying: You did this on the grasslands and you are still doing this here. Will you ever stop?

    However, the party branch was even more clear and determined about adhering to the direction of half-farm half-study at this time. Over the past few years, they have continuously conducted investigations and understandings of previous graduates. Production team cadres and the vast majority of commune members used a large number of cases to illustrate that the students trained by the school using the method of laboring and studying at the same time are good and the most popular. So when new ideological changes occurred among teachers and students, the party branch believed: There is nothing strange about this. The environment has changed, the conditions have improved, and people's thinking has also changed. The problem is that the party branch's mind must be clear and its position must be firm. We must carry the revolution through to the end.

    The party branch then led everyone to study Chairman Mao's works and the party's educational policy, and more clearly discussed what kind of people to cultivate and how to cultivate them. Next, they organized teachers and students to go deep into the production teams to investigate and understand the situation of previous graduates, and invited graduates Chen Shaoqin, Gao Shan, and Zhao Guoliang to come to the school to make reports. Their opinions were so unanimous: we must adhere to laboring and studying at the same time in order to cultivate talents needed by the countryside. At the same time, the party branch also set up a school history exhibition hall and carried out activities to tell the school history and pass on the school spirit. In this way, after nearly half a year of visits, investigations, and studies, the emotions of teachers and students were re-stabilized, and the labor point of view that was almost lost was resolutely restored. The half-farm half-study educational system has undergone another test, and it has become more deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and more vibrant.

    The Work of the Party Branch Must Go Deep Into the Field of Teaching
    In half-farm half-study schools, the struggle between proletarian and bourgeois educational ideas is not only manifested in the road and direction of schooling, but also in the teaching methods. If the party branch of a half-farm half-study school does not lead this aspect of the struggle well, and the party's ideological and political work cannot penetrate into the field of teaching, it will still not be able to truly adhere to the direction of half-farm half-study.

    Some teachers who were transferred from full-time schools or who had recently graduated from full-time secondary vocational schools would simply sit in the classroom and copy a set of textbooks from full-time secondary vocational schools when teaching. The party branch advocated going to the scene for teaching; in terms of teaching materials, more useful knowledge for the countryside should be taught and taught first, and less useful or even no useful knowledge should be taught less or not taught at all. Some teachers disagreed, saying that this would damage the systematicness and completeness of teaching; even saying: Experts watch the tricks, laymen watch the excitement. Meaning that party branch secretary Pei Jingchun was a layman in running education. Comrade Pei Jingchun thought: I am indeed a layman in running education, and I don't even know what a secondary vocational school is like. However, no matter what layman or expert, as long as the students can understand the lesson and can use it when they return to the countryside, it is enough. After discussion, the party branch made a decision: those who have clear ideas will change first, those who have clear ideas later will change later, and those who do not have clear ideas will not change for the time being. At the same time, branch secretaries and branch committee members all went deep into the classroom to listen to lectures. Once, Comrade Pei Jingchun listened to professional course teacher Sun Yuzhen talk about "the restraint method of horses." Sun Yuzhen talked a lot from the origin of horses, and explained many nouns, concepts, and terms. After class, they conducted a survey and understanding of the students with Sun Yuzhen. The students said: "The teacher's lectures are very hard, but we can't hear clearly or remember them"; some students said: "Can the things the teacher talks about be used in the countryside in the future?" Some people advocated leading a horse and showing us specifically how to restrain it? The party branch obtained Sun Yuzhen's consent. The next time he taught this lesson, he led a horse and taught while doing it. The party branch also invited other teachers and students to listen to the lecture. Sun Yuzhen stood in front of the horse and made a few gestures, and the students all understood. They said one after another: I can see clearly, remember firmly, and can use it when I go back. Originally, this teacher planned to use eight lessons to explain the problem, but it only took two lessons to explain it clearly. Many theoretical knowledge that was not related to the restraint method was deleted and not taught. This time, the news that "two lessons solved eight lessons" caused a sensation throughout the school.

    The party branch seized this example and conducted discussions among all teachers and students. In this way, the teachers who were originally unwilling to change took the initiative to propose their own teaching reform plans to the party branch, greatly reducing the parts that were not related to rural production, and paying attention to physical object teaching and on-site teaching. When lecturing on "Physiology and Anatomy" and "Pathology", dissect dead horses and dead sheep carcasses; when lecturing on sheep scabies, guide students to mix medicines and sheep medicinal baths; when lecturing on acupuncture, lead horses to find acupoints. Now, the school has also established a livestock disease clinic. If the livestock of the production team or commune members get sick, they are sent to the clinic, and the teachers organize the students to learn and treat them, which not only supports production, but also further integrates theory with practice.

    Over the past few years, the Zhaoyuan Animal Husbandry and Veterinary School party branch has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieved some success along the path of half-farm half-study, which has been well received by the masses. However, the school party branch is not complacent because of this. Every time people from other provinces and counties come to visit, Comrade Pei Jingchun always says: When we are in difficulty, we must adhere to the direction of half-farm half-study. In a wave of praise, we must not be dazzled, but must adhere to the direction and always advance along the road guided by the Party.

    办学八年，打了八年思想仗
    ——肇源县畜牧兽医学校党支部是怎样领导坚持半农半读方向的？
    中共黑龙江肇源县委宣传部
    编者按：政治工作是一切工作的生命线。突出政治，用毛泽东思想挂了帅，我们的工作就有了正确的方向。方向问题解决了，别的问题也就容易解决了。今天发表的黑龙江肇源县畜牧兽医学校党支部坚持半农半读方向的稿件，再一次生动地说明了这一真理。
    半工半读、半农半读的新型教育制度，是新生事物；要使这一新生事物健康地成长，有许多问题，象师资、教材、教学方法、劳动基地等等问题，需要解决。但是，最重要、最根本、首先需要解决的，还是一个办学方向问题。只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚持政治挂帅，提高广大教育工作者、教师的政治觉悟，使大家充分认识到半工半读、半农半读教育制度的伟大战略意义，兴无产阶级教育思想，灭资产阶级教育思想，才能把这样的学校真正办好。
    肇源县畜牧兽医学校不正是这样的吗？他们所以取得这样大的成绩，主要不是靠设备、靠教材，而是靠毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想使他们懂得了应当怎样在教育战线上闹革命？怎样闯出无产阶级办学校的道路？这样，物质困难逐步克服了，教学方法、教材等等问题也都逐步解决了。
    用毛泽东思想统帅一切，我们就会无往而不胜。工业生产是这样，农业生产是这样，文化教育事业同样是这样。
    肇源县畜牧兽医学校是半农半读教育战线上的一面红旗。从一九五八年创办以来，始终坚持半农半读的方向，教师半农半教，学生半农半读。八年来，基本上做到每年教学六个月，劳动五个月，放假一个月。
    这所学校认真坚持半农半读，培养了一批又红又专、能文能武的新型劳动者。他们先后培养出一、二、四年制毕业生一百九十五人。其中，一部分人参加公社畜牧兽医防治所工作，大部分人回队当社员。他们在生产或工作岗位上，始终坚持半农半医，许多回队参加生产的毕业生，既是五好社员，又是防疫员或兽医，群众夸他们：“拿起锄头是农民，拿起灌角是兽医”。现在，这个县的生产队或社员的牲口得了病，或者需要劁猪、骟马等等，在本村本地就可以解决。不仅减轻了社员和生产队的经济负担，而且使牲畜的防疫灭病工作做得更及时。
    第一个思想仗，懂得什么是闹革命
    这所学校是怎样坚持半农半读方向的呢？这个学校党支部体会最深的是：只有活学活用毛主席著作，不断进行思想斗争，才能不断实行革命。办学的八年，实际上是活学活用毛主席著作的八年，是正确的办学思想和各种不正确的办学思想斗争的八年。
    一九五八年春，县委决定创办这所学校的时候，明确提出了两点指示：一、培养农村需要的畜牧兽医人员；二、自力更生、勤俭办校，不向国家伸手要钱。县委抽调原乡党委副书记裴景春同志担任学校党支部书记。
    四月中旬，这位在旧社会当过五年雇工，只念过两个月书的党支部书记，带着三本《毛泽东选集》，同两个刚从中等专业学校毕业、两个刚从全日制学校调来的教师，三十几个学生，来到了学校。这个学校，有十一间破牛棚，座落在一个一望无际的大草原上，棚内牛粪足足有三尺深。课桌、板凳、教科书、黑板、粉笔，要什么没有什么。面对这种情况，部分教师和学生动摇了，有的教师说：“那儿不能办学校，为什么非得办在这荒凉的草原上？”有的教师说：“什么自力更生，这是自不量力呗！”少数学生铺盖卷还没打开，就想退学回家，有一个学生第二天就走了。裴景春同志想：这算什么苦哟！比起我当长工的日子好多了。他主张千方百计，克服困难，把学校办起来。
    县委了解这一情况后，立即动员机关、学校尽可能支援一部分桌、凳、教科书，同时召开县委常委会，讨论这个问题。一致认为：毛泽东同志教导我们，我们国家本来就是“一穷二白”，因为“穷”和“白”，就要我们闹革命。我们要闹革命，就要靠自力更生，就要不怕吃苦。而且，环境越“苦”，培养出来的学生就越能懂得人民群众的疾苦。因此，县委坚决主张把学校办好，指示学校党支部领导全校师生，好好学习毛主席著作，把大家的思想武装起来。
    县委的决定，鼓舞了党支部克服困难的信心。党支部决定动员全校师生用自己的双手创办学校。裴景春同志同大家一起，白天起牛粪，整修校舍，清晨、夜晚，他就给大家念《愚公移山》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，边念边议，边议边念。结合学习毛主席著作，党支部还出了个题目：我们是来干什么的？让大家讨论。开始，众说不一。教师说：我是来教学生念书识字的；管理员说，我是来管生活的；学生说：我是来学兽医的。当着大家读到毛主席著作中“我们都是来自五湖四海，为了一个共同的革命目标，走到一起来了。”许多人联系自己的思想一检查，都说：别看咱们具体工作不一样，教书的也好，管理生活的也好，学习的也好，还不都是为了一个共同的目的——为咱们社会主义新农村培养畜牧兽医人材，为广大农民服务。这不就是闹革命么。更多的人说：既然是来革命的，就不能怕吃苦，就要克服眼前困难。
    话不说不明，灯不拨不亮，毛泽东思想使人们的思想开阔了，眼睛亮了。原先思想有些动摇的教师说：不怕困难大，就怕思想差，困难再多，有革命思想，啥也不怕。
    有了革命思想，就有了革命办法。十一间牛棚，上课时是课堂，吃饭时是食堂，睡觉时又成了宿舍。没有课桌、板凳，学生就坐在地上、背包上上课；粮食、蔬菜缺少，支部书记和支部委员领着全校师生在草原上刨荒，种下庄稼，蔬菜。秋天，教师、学生增加了，支部书记、支部委员和全校八个教师，八十九个学生一起，到草原上打羊草，劳动一个多月，几千顷的草原打得溜溜光，仅这一项，就收入了五万多元。就这样，他们依靠自己双手劳动得来的收入，盖了三十四间土平房的校舍，添置了一百二十四套桌椅，买了四千多本书。到年底结算，还结余两万多元。
    不断打好思想仗，实行教师劳动化
    革命的道路总是艰难曲折的。第一个思想仗打胜了，只是他们工作的开始。作为半农半读学校党组织来说，千万不能满足于第一仗的胜利。他们认识到：不断打胜思想仗，才能不断进行教育革命。
    物质生活上的困难初步解决以后，加强教学工作就成为一个重要课题。怎样加强？有人说：当初学校要啥没啥，不搞劳动，学校办不起来；现在办起来了，劳动应该减少，应该集中力量进行教学。有些教师认为：一面读书，一面劳动，学校不象学校，垦荒队不象垦荒队，主张办个全日制的畜牧兽医学校。那时，学校党支部虽不象现在这样明确认识到，坚持一面读书，一面劳动，可以培养出具有社会主义觉悟的、又红又专的、既能从事体力劳动又能从事脑力劳动的新型劳动者，但是，有几点他们是明确的。第一，他们认真学习了毛泽东同志的指示：我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者；第二，县委一再指示要自力更生，劳动养校，培养出来的学生要能回到农村去；第三，党支部书记裴景春同志是农村土生土长的，知道生产队和社员欢迎没有架子、关心群众生产和生活的兽医。而要实现这些要求，学生在学习期间，就不能脱离生产劳动。当时党支部做了一项决定：半农半读的方向不能动摇，具体问题可以商讨。县委支持这一决定，指示党支部把党的决定变成全校师生的实际行动。
    学校党支部一面传达了县委的指示，再次组织大家学习毛主席著作，学习党的教育方针，一面把县畜牧场的场长、老兽医、生产队的老饲养员和放牧员都请来，同他们共同研究学生毕业之后上那儿去？干什么？学生怎样才能学得好，学得快，学得有用等等问题。
    认识问题解决了，但是，要真正坚持半农半读的方向，关键在于教师能不能在实际行动当中，真正坚持半农半教，真正实现劳动化。这个学校党支部认为，在教师实现劳动化的问题上，最有效的办法是支部书记、支部委员和党员带头。这些年，党支部书记裴景春、党员副校长刘科和其他党员，都是那儿艰苦上那儿，那儿活重上那儿。每年秋季，在草原上连续一个多月的打羊草、打苇子，是最重最累的劳动，裴景春、刘科总是和其他教师、学生一起，同吃、同住、同劳动。一九五九年打羊草时，有些师生不会，裴景春把着刀，一个一个教。晚上，师生休息了，裴景春一个人借着月光悄悄地把大家使了一天的刀磨得又亮又锋利。秋夜的草原，蚊虫多得惊人，裴景春怕师生夜里睡不好，点起烟火给大家熏蚊子。夜深了，他不愿到草棚里把大家惊醒，就悄悄地钻到草堆下露宿。一九六四年到江湾打草，什么地方草高、草厚，裴景春和支部委员、党员们就在什么地方劳动。好几届新生刚入校时，都把这位年近半百的老书记当成“老工人”，亲热地夸他：“咱学校这个老工友真好！”支部书记、支部委员、党员的这种无声命令，默默地感染着其他教师，一些刚来到这里，对劳动感到不习惯的教师，在潜移默化中，慢慢地变了。数学课教师马长保，前几年刚调来时，不愿参加劳动，偷偷地自修大学的数学课程，准备将来到全日制中学里当个有名望的数学教师。可是，在支部书记、党员的影响下，这个年轻的小伙子不仅积极参加各项劳动，而且检查了个人成名思想，下决心在这儿干一辈子。有一个时期，因工作需要，上级把他调到全日制学校去了，他感到那里劳动太少，不习惯，要求调回来。县委考虑了他的要求，又把他调回来了。
    一定将革命进行到底
    事情到这里，看来这个学校教师劳动化的问题已经解决了，坚持半农半读的方向没有问题了。实则不然，轻视劳动的思想在有些人的脑子里是根深蒂固的。今天解决了，明天，在新的气候和土壤的条件下，它仍然会萌芽。半农半读学校的党组织，应该善于抓住变化了的情况，反复教育。
    一九六四年春天，县委为了照顾学生能够就近入学，将学校迁到原黑龙江省野生动物饲养场的旧址——欧力马屯。由于学校环境更新，部分教师的思想又开始变化了。有的教师说：这回要改成国家中专了，不用半农半读了。有些学生在教室里墙上写着“松花江第二分院”；甚至有些教师的爱人看见学校仍然坚持一面劳动，一面读书，也不满地说：在大草原上这么干，到这儿还是这么干，你们还有个头没有？
    但是，党支部这时对坚持半农半读的方向更加明确、坚定了。几年来，他们对历届毕业生不断进行过调查、了解，生产队干部和广大社员用大量事例说明学校用一面劳动、一面读书的办法，培养出来的学生是好样儿的，是最受欢迎的。所以当师生中发生新的思想变化以后，党支部认为：这没有什么奇怪，环境变了，条件好了，人们的思想也跟着变了。问题是党支部的头脑要清醒，立场要坚定，一定要将革命进行到底。
    党支部又领导大家学习毛主席著作，学习党的教育方针，更加明确地讨论了培养什么样的人，怎样培养等等问题。接着，组织师生，深入生产队，调查、了解历届毕业生的情况，并请毕业生陈绍琴、高山、赵国良等到学校来做了报告。他们的意见是那样一致：一定要坚持一面读书，一面劳动，才能培养出农村需要的人材来。同时，党支部还办了校史展览馆，开展了讲校史、传校风的活动。这样，前后经过将近半年时间的访问、调查、学习，师生的情绪才重新安定下来，几乎要丢掉的劳动观点，又坚决地恢复了起来。半农半读教育制度经受了再一次考验，它变得更深入人心，更富有生命力。
    党支部的工作要深入教学领域
    在半农半读学校里，无产阶级和资产阶级的教育思想的斗争，不仅表现在办学道路、办学方向方面，还表现在教学方法方面。半农半读学校的党支部如果不领导好这方面的斗争，党的思想政治工作不能深入到教学领域里去，仍然不能真正坚持半农半读的方向。
    一些从全日制学校调来或从全日制中等专业学校毕业不久的教师，在上课时，光是坐在教室里，照搬全日制中等专业学校的一套教材。党支部主张到现场去教学；在教材方面，对农村有用的知识多讲、先讲，用处不大的少讲甚至不讲。有些教师不同意，说这样会破坏教学的系统性、完整性；甚至说：内行看门道，外行看热闹。意思是说党支部书记裴景春同志对办教育是外行。裴景春同志心想：自己对办教育确实是外行，连中等专业学校是个什么样子都不知道。可是，不管什么外行，内行，反正讲了课，学生能理解，将来回到农村能用得上就行。党支部经过讨论，做了一项决定：思想先通的先改，后通的后改，不通的暂时不改。同时，支部书记、支部委员都深入课堂听课。有一次，裴景春同志听专业课教师孙玉振讲“马的保定法”。孙玉振从马的起源讲起，名词、概念、术语讲了很多。课后，他们和孙玉振一起，对学生做了调查了解，学生说：“老师讲课挺费劲，就是咱听不清，记不住”；还有的学生说：“老师讲这号东西，将来到农村能用上吗？”有人则主张牵匹马来，具体做给我们看看，究竟怎么保定？党支部征得了孙玉振的同意，下次上这节课时，就牵了匹马来，边做边讲。党支部还把其他教师、学生都请来听课。孙玉振站在马面前，几个动作一比划，学生全明白了，纷纷说：看得清，记得牢，回去能用上。原来这位教师准备用八堂课讲的问题，只花两堂课的时间就讲清楚了。许多和保定法没有关系的理论知识都删除不讲了。这一来，“两堂课解决了八堂课”的消息，轰动了全校。
    党支部抓住这一事例，在全校师生中进行了讨论。这样，原来不愿改的教师主动向党支部提出了自己的教学改革计划，大大减去了和农村生产没有关系的部分，并注意了实物教学和现场教学。讲《生理解剖学》、《病理学》，就解剖死马、死羊尸体；讲羊疥癣，就指导学生调药和羊药浴；讲针灸学，就牵马找穴位。现在，这个学校还设立了家畜疫病门诊部，生产队或社员的牲口得了病，就送来门诊部，教师组织学生边学边治，既支援了生产，又使理论进一步结合实际。
    几年来，肇源畜牧兽医学校党支部高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，沿着半农半读的道路，取得了一些成就，受到了群众的好评。但是，这个学校党支部并不因此而自满。每次外省外县有人来参观时，裴景春同志总是说：在困难的时候，我们要坚持半农半读方向，在一片颂扬声中，我们也不能眼花缭乱，更要坚持方向，永远沿着党所指引的道路前进。
