    Dare to Revolutionize Oneself
    By following the "travels" of pigs, fish, and eggs, I realized that to do a good job in commercial work, leading cadres must achieve ideological revolutionization and establish a revolutionary work style of going deep into reality and among the masses.
    Entrusted by the Party and the people, commercial departments manage a large number of commodities and shoulder the important task of serving production and the people's lives. Whether this task can be well completed is closely related to what ideas and methods our leading cadres use to guide the work.
    In the past, the fresh and live commodity operation of the Nanjing Municipal Food Department had many links, high costs, large expenses, and heavy losses, which was a "long-standing and difficult" problem. We had tried to solve it, collected materials, written plans, and held meetings, but after a while, we didn't find a solution. Over time, everyone held prejudices and preconceived notions, and always felt unsure about breaking through this "long-standing and difficult" problem.
    In 1963, the number of live pigs managed by our bureau increased by one-third compared with 1962, and fresh eggs, fish, poultry, etc., also increased significantly. Consumers' quality requirements for these fresh and live commodities are getting higher and higher. The Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China also required us to significantly reduce the cost of pork. The instructions of the Municipal Committee must be resolutely implemented, and the objective situation also forces us to improve our operation and management. But where to start? At the beginning, I sent cadres to the grassroots several times to investigate. However, after the investigation, everyone's opinions were not consistent. Some said that the reason for the loss was that the allocated prices were too high and the purchase and sale price difference was too small; others said that the reason for the loss was that the transportation department did not cooperate well, and the goods were in transit for too long, and so on. As for what problems exist in our own acceptance, breeding, transportation, slaughter, and sales, either we can't see them, or we think that even if there are problems, they are not the main ones. In this way, we still couldn't find the key to the problem.
    "No investigation, no right to speak." The Party and the people have always asked us to do this, and we must not "build cars behind closed doors" to formulate plans and order schemes. I decided to go for a walk myself to understand what was going on. I chose Zhengjia Nong Purchasing Station, a representative acquisition point in Danyang County, a key county for live pig allocation in the province, as the starting point for the investigation, and traveled with the pigs. I went to the countryside with the staff of the grassroots station to collect pigs, load them on the truck, and escort them. Many vivid facts made me feel that we do have many problems in our ideas on fresh and live commodity operation and in our business techniques, which can no longer be taken lightly. By traveling with the pigs, the problems in live pig allocation were basically figured out. After cutting unnecessary intermediate links, implementing direct transportation, and trying to shorten the time for grassroots pen storage, the circulation cost of live pig transportation was greatly reduced. Last May, I went to the Chengguan Supply and Marketing Station of Lishui County Food Company to stay and tested a new measure of on-site purchase in the production area, on-site slaughter, and direct transportation of white meat to the city. This method can both leave the pig slaughter soup in the countryside as fertilizer, and save the food company the slaughter cost, avoid the loss of live pigs falling, and further reduce the operating costs of live pigs.
    Consumers hope to buy fresh and live fish. The Aquatic Product Supply and Marketing Company once suggested that we try to transport fresh and live fish from Jinhu County to Nanjing for sale. However, some people emphasized that fresh fish are subject to geographical and natural conditions, and it would be difficult to transport them from a place 280 miles away from Nanjing, the quality would not be good, and the cost would definitely be high. Because I myself had not participated in practice, I also felt that these opinions had some truth, and I did not actively support the experiment of transporting fresh and live fish. Later, I went to the aquatic product purchasing and marketing station, mobile purchasing boat, and fish transit station in Jinhu County to stay and solicit opinions from old workers and old business personnel, and found that the reason why it is not easy to guarantee the quality and high cost of operating fresh and live fish is that there are too many operating links and there are problems in transportation arrangements. After improvement, the same fresh fish from Baima Lake in Jinhu County used to take four or five days on the road, but now it only takes one day, and the fast ones can be collected in the morning and supplied to the Nanjing vegetable market the next morning.
    In the past, I always thought that commodities should be allocated layer by layer according to the business system to ensure reliability; documents and visas were the basis for ensuring quality and could not be cancelled at all. Whenever we mentioned improving operations, we would give many reasons to explain that the allocation route could not be changed, the operating links could not be reduced, and the fixed costs could not be saved, etc., and we never thought of breaking the cumbersome philosophy in it. By following the "travels" of pigs, fish, and eggs, the facts told me that mechanically moving the system and relying on reports to conduct commodity operations would not be possible to create or move forward. For example, in the past, after farmers delivered fresh eggs, they had to go through five or six links to transport them to retail stores in Nanjing. Every time they passed through a link, they had to turn them over once or twice; every time they turned them over, a few would be broken. After more than a dozen turnovers, the acceptance documents became thicker and thicker, and the losses became larger and larger. Later, we streamlined the links, and fresh eggs were transported directly from the grassroots purchasing station to the wholesale department. With this reform alone, the city's fresh egg loss rate dropped from 5% to 1%, the commodity circulation cost decreased by 46%, and the eggs bought by consumers were fresher.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "If people want to achieve victory in their work, that is, to achieve the expected results, they must make their thinking conform to the laws of the objective external world. If they do not conform, they will fail in practice." In the past, there were some problems in our work. The root cause is that leading cadres are content with the status quo, lack revolutionary vigor, and their thinking cannot keep up with the development of the objective situation. At the same time, their work style is not deep enough, so they have not figured out the laws in commodity operation. By following the "travels" of pigs, fish, and eggs, I realized that to do a good job in commercial work, leading cadres must dare to revolutionize themselves, must achieve ideological revolutionization, change the work style of being divorced from reality and the masses, and establish a work style of going deep into reality and closely contacting the masses.

### 要敢于革自己的“命”

    要敢于革自己的“命”
    通过跟着猪、鱼、蛋“旅行”，使我认识到要做好商业工作，领导干部必须实现思想革命化，树立深入实际、深入群众的革命作风。
    商业部门接受党和人民的委托，经营着大量商品，担负着为生产服务、为人民生活服务的重任。这一任务能不能很好地完成，与我们领导干部用什么思想、什么方法来指导工作，有十分密切的关系。
    过去，南京市食品部门鲜活商品的经营中，环节多，成本高，费用大，损耗重，是个“老大难”的问题。我们曾经试图加以解决，收集过材料，写过方案，开过会议，但是闹了一阵子，并没有闹出个头绪来。时间一长，大家胸怀成见，脑藏“框框”，对于突破“老大难”总觉得没有把握。
    一九六三年，我们局经营的生猪比一九六二年增加了三分之一，鲜蛋、鱼、家禽等也显著增加。消费者对这些鲜活商品的质量要求越来越高。中共南京市委也要求我们大幅度地降低猪肉成本。市委的指示要坚决执行，客观形势也逼着我们必须改善经营管理。但是，究竟从何着手呢？开始，我曾几次派干部到基层去调查。但是调查回来，大家的意见也不一致。有的说，亏损的原因是调拨作价太高，购销差价太小；有的说，亏损的原因是交通部门配合不好，商品在途时间过长，等等。对于我们本身在验收、饲养、调运、宰杀、销售中存在什么问题，或者看不到，或者认为即使有问题也不是主要的。这样，还是找不到问题的关键。
    “没有调查就没有发言权”。党和人民一直要求我们这样作，我们决不能“闭门造车”地拟规划，订方案。我决定亲自去走一趟，了解了解到底是怎么回事。我在全省生猪调拨重点县——丹阳县，选择了一个有代表性的郑家弄收购点，作为调查起点，跟猪旅行。我和基层站的职工一起下乡收猪，装车，押运。许多活生生的事实，使我感到我们在鲜活商品经营思想上，在业务技术上，确实存在着不少问题，不能再等闲视之。通过跟猪旅行，生猪调拨中的问题也基本上摸清了。经过砍掉不必要的中间环节，实行直线运输，以及设法缩短基层圈存时间等，生猪调运的流转费用大为降低。去年五月份，我又到溧水县食品公司在城供销站蹲点，试行了产区就地收购、就地宰杀、直运白肉进城的新措施。这种作法既可将宰猪汤留在农村作肥料，又使食品公司节省了宰杀费用，避免了生猪掉膘的损耗，进一步降低了生猪经营费用。
    消费者希望买到鲜活鱼。水产供销公司曾经建议我们从金湖县试运鲜活鱼到南京来卖。但是，有人强调鲜鱼受地理和自然条件的限制，要从离南京二百八十里外的地方运来，质量不会好，费用一定高。由于我自己没有参加过实践，也认为这些意见有一定道理，对运鲜活鱼的试验没有积极支持。后来，我到金湖县的水产购销站、流动收购船、运鱼中转站去蹲点，向老工人、老业务人员征求意见，发现经营鲜活鱼所以不容易保证质量，费用高，一是经营环节多，一是运输安排方面有问题。经过改进，同样是金湖县白马湖的鲜鱼，过去路上要走四五天，现在只要一天，快的当天上午收，第二天早晨就可以在南京菜市场供应了。
    过去，我总认为商品按业务系统层层调拨，才能落实可靠；单据、签证是保证质量的凭据，一概不能取消。一提到改善经营，我们就举出许多理由，说明调拨路线不能改，经营环节不能减，固定费用不能省，等等，从来没有想去打破其中的烦琐哲学。通过跟着猪、鱼、蛋旅行，事实告诉了我，机械地搬制度，靠表报进行商品经营，就不可能有所创造，有所前进。例如，过去农民交售鲜蛋以后，运到南京市零售店，一般要经过五六道环节。每经过一道环节，都要翻动一两次；每翻动一次，就要破损几个。经过十几次翻动，验收的单据越来越厚，损耗也越来越大。后来，我们精简了环节，鲜蛋直接从基层收购站运到批发部。仅这一项改革，全市鲜蛋损耗率就从百分之五降为百分之一，商品流通费用减少了百分之四十六，消费者买到的蛋也更新鲜了。
    毛主席教导我们：“人们要想得到工作的胜利即得到预想的结果，一定要使自己的思想合于客观外界的规律性，如果不合，就会在实践中失败。”过去我们工作中存在一些问题，究其根源，主要是领导干部安于现状，缺少革命朝气，思想跟不上客观形势的发展，同时作风不够深入，因而没有摸清商品经营中的规律。通过跟着猪、鱼、蛋旅行，使我认识到要做好商业工作，领导干部必须敢于革自己的“命”，必须实现思想革命化，改变脱离实际、脱离群众的作风，树立深入实际、密切联系群众的作风。
