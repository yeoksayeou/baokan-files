    A Dirty Political Conspiracy
    Observer

    The "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" convened by the Japanese government concluded on April 6th and 7th, after two days. This conference is the first so-called "international conference" openly assembled by Japanese militarists in the twenty-odd years since their defeat in the war. It is a new and significant step in the accelerated and comprehensive revival and external expansion of Japanese militarist forces after the war. It is also a dirty political conspiracy between U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to collude with each other, invade Asia, and oppose China.

    The Sato government has been touting this Tokyo conference to the skies. They say that this conference will enable Southeast Asian countries to "establish" something of "genuine peace and prosperity," to "unite with close solidarity," and to "rely on Asia's own cooperation for development," and so on. In his opening speech, Sato also vigorously proclaimed that Japan, as "a member of Asia," would "significantly expand its aid for the development of Southeast Asia" and "advance together" with Southeast Asia. The joint communiqué issued at the meeting contained no new content and completely repeated the rhetoric of the Sato government.

    These quack remedies of the Sato government are worthless. What "peace and prosperity" in Southeast Asia, what Japan's "expanded" "aid" to Southeast Asia, are, in essence, nothing more than efforts to further colonize the economies of those Southeast Asian countries that have long been firmly controlled by foreign monopoly capital. The six agenda items at this Tokyo conference boiled down to only one: "Agricultural Southeast Asia, Industrial Japan." The communiqué of the meeting also blatantly demanded that Southeast Asian countries "improve investment conditions in various countries." What does this mean? Many of the Southeast Asian countries participating in this conference have long been the objects of insatiable plunder and exploitation by imperialist monopoly capital, especially American monopoly capital. They have already been squeezed dry by imperialist monopoly capital, leaving the people impoverished and the country bankrupt. Now, the Sato government wants these countries to "improve" "investment conditions," so that these countries will completely depend on U.S. and Japanese monopoly capital. Obviously, the "development plan" designed by the Sato government for Southeast Asian countries is a naked plan for enslavement and colonial expansion.

    In fact, the real backstage boss of this much-hyped Tokyo conference is not the Japanese zaibatsu, but the Wall Street monopoly capital group. The so-called "Asian cooperation" is just a cover. As everyone knows, in April 1965, U.S. President Johnson, based on the "big stick and carrot" policy, proposed a ten-billion-dollar "Southeast Asia Development Plan." The purpose of this plan was to cooperate with the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam, to step up the support of the U.S. imperialist puppet regimes in South Vietnam and Southeast Asia, to enslave the people of Southeast Asian countries, and to stabilize the American base of aggression in the region. As soon as Johnson's plan came out, it was actively responded to by the Sato government. It openly stated that it would "contribute" to Johnson's plan. Chief Cabinet Secretary Hashimoto of the Sato government bluntly stated at a press conference held during the conference that the source of funds for "Southeast Asia development" "includes the World Bank and the ten billion dollars in President Johnson's Southeast Asia Development Plan." This exposed the secret of "Asian cooperation." This Tokyo conference was entirely planned behind the scenes by U.S. imperialism and handled by the Sato government. The Sato government only played the role of an agent and second boss of U.S. imperialism's aggression against Southeast Asia.

    The Sato government has repeatedly claimed that the Tokyo conference is purely "economic" in nature and has "absolutely no political intentions." This is like saying "there is no silver buried here" when no one has accused you of hiding any.

    Today, U.S. imperialism has regarded Japanese militarism as a major accomplice in pursuing its policy of aggression and war in Asia. It has directed Japan to conclude the "Japan-South Korea Treaty" and is stepping up the formation of a "Northeast Asia Military Alliance" with Japan as its core. It has colluded with Japanese reactionaries to formulate a series of secret military plans with socialist countries such as Korea and China as imaginary enemies, and is trying every possible means to release Japanese militarism from its cage to participate in the wars of aggression launched by U.S. imperialism in Asia. The Sato government has, in fact, directly and indirectly participated in U.S. imperialism's war of aggression against Vietnam. Now, U.S. imperialism is in an extremely embarrassing situation in the war of aggression against Vietnam, and the foundation of its colonial rule established in the Southeast Asian region has undergone fundamental changes. The Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is virtually paralyzed. It is precisely under this precarious situation that U.S. imperialism has instructed the Sato government to come out and gather a new alliance of reactionary forces in Southeast Asia in order to support the U.S. imperialist puppet regime in Southeast Asia, to suppress the national liberation movement in Southeast Asia, and to attempt to establish a military encirclement of China.

    In the months before the Tokyo conference, the Johnson government successively sent Mansfield, Bundy, Harriman, Humphrey and other important officials to Japan and Asian countries for intensive activities. The February 14th issue of The Washington Post bluntly stated that the United States wanted to "form a new alliance" in Asia. The February 17th issue of the Asahi Shimbun also revealed that Japan is becoming the "center of stable Asian forces expected by the United States," "uniting countries around China into an anti-China front." It is very clear that the "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" held in Tokyo is a prelude to U.S. imperialism, with Japan as the core, planning a new alliance of aggression in Southeast Asia.

    People can fully see from the members participating in the Tokyo conference what the "Asian unity" promoted by the Sato government is all about. Most of the participants are lackeys and puppets of U.S. imperialism, representatives of the most reactionary and corrupt forces in Southeast Asian countries. It is not at all surprising that Japanese militarists want to "unite with close solidarity" with the reactionaries of Southeast Asian countries. However, the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries also want to use Japan as a "member of Asia" as a guise, and use "economic assistance" as bait, to gradually drag some peaceful and neutral countries in Southeast Asia into the quagmire of the U.S. imperialist anti-China alliance. This political conspiracy of U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries will naturally arouse the vigilance of some Southeast Asian countries that cherish national independence and the people of Southeast Asian countries.

    The convening of the "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" also exposed the Japanese militarists' own arrogant ambition to carry out colonial expansion abroad. Japanese militarist forces are accelerating their revival under the support of U.S. imperialism. Japanese monopoly capital, which serves as the economic foundation of militarism, is also rapidly expanding under the wings of U.S. monopoly capital. They are increasingly intensifying their attacks on the Japanese working people at home, and are increasingly ambitiously carrying out colonial expansion and aggression abroad. Since the

    一个肮脏的政治阴谋
    观察家
    日本政府召集的“东南亚开发部长会议”，于四月六日、七日开了两天之后，已经鸣锣收场。这个会议是日本军国主义者战败后二十多年来第一次公开出面纠集的所谓“国际会议”。它是战后日本军国主义势力加紧全面复活和对外扩张的一个新的重大步骤，也是美帝国主义和日本反动派相互勾结、侵略亚洲、反对中国的一个肮脏的政治阴谋。
    佐藤政府把这次东京会议吹得天花乱坠。他们说，这次会议要使东南亚国家“确立”什么“真正的和平与繁荣”，要以所谓“亲密团结的情分结合起来”，“依靠亚洲自己的合作实行开发”，等等。佐藤在他的开幕词中还大肆宣扬，日本作为“亚洲一员”，将“大幅度地扩大为开发东南亚所需要的援助”，并同东南亚“共同前进”。会议发表的联合公报没有任何新的内容，完全重复了佐藤政府的腔调。
    佐藤政府的这些狗皮膏药是一文不值的。什么东南亚的“和平与繁荣”，什么日本“扩大”对东南亚的“援助”，说穿了，就是要使那些早已被外国垄断资本所牢牢控制的东南亚国家的经济进一步殖民地化。这次东京会议上的六项议程，归结起来只有一条，那就是：“农业东南亚，工业日本”。会议的公报还露骨地要求东南亚国家“改善各国的投资条件”。这是什么意思呢？参加这次会议的许多东南亚国家早已成为帝国主义垄断资本，尤其是美国垄断资本贪得无厌的掠夺和剥削的对象。它们被帝国主义垄断资本已经压榨得民穷财尽了。现在，佐藤政府还要这些国家“改善”“投资条件”，使这些国家彻底依附于美日垄断资本。很显然，佐藤政府为东南亚国家所设计的“开发计划”，是一个赤裸裸的奴役和殖民扩张的计划。
    其实，这次大吹大擂的东京会议，它的真正的后台老板并不是日本财阀，而是华尔街的垄断资本集团。所谓“亚洲自己的合作”，只是一个幌子。大家知道，一九六五年四月，美国总统约翰逊根据“大棒和胡萝卜”政策，提出了一个十亿美元的“开发东南亚计划”。这个计划的目的，是为了配合美帝国主义侵略越南的战争，加紧扶植美帝国主义在南越和东南亚的傀儡政权，奴役东南亚各国人民，稳定美国在这一地区的侵略阵地。约翰逊的这个计划一经出笼，就得到佐藤政府的积极响应。它公开表示要对约翰逊的计划“作出贡献”。佐藤政府的官房长官桥本，在这次会议期间所举行的记者招待会上，毫不隐讳地说，“开发东南亚”的资金来源，“包括世界银行、约翰逊总统的东南亚开发计划中的十亿美元在内”。这就一语戳穿了“亚洲合作”的秘密。这次东京会议完全是由美帝国主义在幕后一手策划，而由佐藤政府经手筹办。佐藤政府只是扮演了美帝国主义侵略东南亚的一个代理人和二老板的角色。
    佐藤政府口口声声宣传，东京会议是纯粹“经济”性质的，“完全没有政治意图”。这叫做“此地无银三百两”。
    今天，美帝国主义已经把日本军国主义当作它在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策的一个主要帮凶。它指使日本缔结了“日韩条约”，加紧拼凑以日本为核心的“东北亚军事同盟”。它勾结日本反动派制订了以朝鲜、中国等社会主义国家为假想敌的一系列秘密军事计划，千方百计地要把日本军国主义放出笼来，参加美帝国主义在亚洲发动的侵略战争。佐藤政府事实上已经直接和间接地参与了美帝国主义侵略越南的战争。现在，美帝国主义在侵越战争中陷于十分狼狈的困境，它在东南亚地区建立起来的殖民统治的基础发生了根本的动摇。东南亚条约组织实际上处于瘫痪状态。正是在这种岌岌可危的形势下，美帝国主义指使佐藤政府出来纠集一个新的东南亚反动势力的联盟，以便支撑美帝国主义在东南亚的傀儡政权，扑灭东南亚民族解放运动，妄图建立对中国的军事包围圈。
    就在东京会议召开前的几个月，约翰逊政府连续派出了曼斯菲尔德、邦迪、哈里曼、汉弗莱等要员，到日本和亚洲各国进行了紧张的活动。二月十四日的《华盛顿邮报》露骨地说：美国要在亚洲“结成一个新的联盟”。二月十七日《朝日新闻》也透露，日本正在成为“美国所期待的稳定亚洲势力的中心”，“把中国周围的各国，团结在反中国的阵线里”。事情很清楚，在东京召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”，正是美帝国主义以日本为核心，在东南亚策划新的侵略联盟的一个前奏。
    人们从参加东京会议的成员中完全可以看出，佐藤政府所宣扬的“亚洲团结”究竟是个什么货色。绝大部分的参加者，都是美帝国主义的走狗和傀儡，是东南亚各国最反动最腐朽的势力的代表，日本军国主义者要同东南亚各国的反动派以“亲密团结的情分结合起来”，这是丝毫也不奇怪的。但是，美日反动派还想利用日本作为“亚洲一员”的招牌，以“经济援助”为诱饵，逐步地把东南亚的一些和平中立国家也拉进美帝国主义反华联盟的臭泥坑里去。美帝国主义和日本反动派的这个政治阴谋，自然地会引起东南亚一些珍惜民族独立的国家和东南亚各国人民的警惕。
    “东南亚开发部长会议”的召集，也暴露了日本军国主义本身向外进行殖民扩张的狂妄野心。日本军国主义势力在美帝国主义的扶植下，正在加紧复活。作为军国主义经济基础的日本垄断资本，也在美国垄断资本的卵翼下迅速膨胀。它们对内日益加紧对日本劳动人民的进攻，对外越来越野心勃勃地进行殖民扩张和侵略活动。佐藤政府上台以后，更进一步加速了日本军国主义向外扩张的步伐。去年，它集中力量在东北亚进行殖民扩张，主要是通过“日韩条约”和同蒋介石匪帮的勾结，使日本军国主义势力重返南朝鲜和中国的台湾省。现在，佐藤政府又吹起了日本军国主义向东南亚进军的喇叭。
    看来，日本军国主义的胃口是不小的。佐藤已经在叫嚷，要由日本来拼凑所谓“亚洲共同体”。日本资产阶级宣传机器也兴高采烈地把这次“东南亚开发部长会议”比作是一九四三年的“大东亚会议”。他们真是得意忘形，无意之中泄露了一个重要机密：在日本统治集团的心目中，佐藤所说的“亚洲共同体”，原来就是当年日本军国主义的“大东亚共荣圈”和“大东亚新秩序”的翻版。所不同的仅仅是：二十三年以前，穿了军装的东条英机坐在会议的主席台上，而今天是穿了美国燕尾服的佐藤荣作坐在主席台上；二十三年前，日本军国主义者自己当大老板，而今天，后台老板是美国，日本军国主义者不过是替美国老板跑腿的“包工头”而已。这就是在东京上演的“东南亚开发部长会议”这出丑剧的全部真相。
    历史是决不会重演的。二十世纪的三十和四十年代，已经一去不复返了。今日的亚洲，只能是亚洲人民的天下，而绝不能是美帝国主义、日本军国主义和任何反动派的天下。美帝国主义不论采取什么手段，不论是自己亲手干，还是指挥日本军国主义出来干，都不能挽救它在亚洲彻底失败的命运。日本军国主义要想依靠美帝国主义来重温“大东亚共荣圈”的迷梦，其结果除了为美帝国主义陪葬而外，也决不可能有别的下场。
