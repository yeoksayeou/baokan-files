    Youth is the most active and vital force in the entire social force. They are the most willing to learn and the least conservative, especially in the socialist era. It is hoped that party organizations in various places, in coordination with the Communist Youth League organizations, will pay attention to studying how to especially give play to the strength of young people, and not treat them in general terms, obliterating their characteristics.
    Seizing the Position of the Next Generation from the Bourgeoisie – The Youth Center
    – The Experience of the Mudanjiang City Youth Center in Organizing and Educating Young People
    CPC Mudanjiang Municipal Committee
    Editor's Note: To manage and educate all urban youths well is a serious class struggle on the educational front to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. The proletariat must use its own world outlook and Mao Zedong Thought to educate the new generation, so that they become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness and successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The bourgeoisie also uses its own world outlook and tries every possible means to influence and corrode young people with decadent ideas, in an attempt to pull them over and make them their successors. The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the next generation is also long-term, tortuous, and sometimes even very fierce.
    Our task is to adopt various forms and methods to manage and educate urban youths well. The Mudanjiang City Youth Center is an important position for conducting socialist education among young people and competing with the bourgeoisie for the next generation.
    This article by the CPC Mudanjiang Municipal Committee raises many important issues concerning the education of young people, such as highlighting politics and using Mao Zedong Thought to educate young people to take the revolutionary path; strengthening the leadership of the Party and guiding the Youth Center in a correct direction, with relevant departments and mass organizations working together to solve major problems in running the "home"; implementing the mass line in running the "home," and carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and thrift in running schools. These are all important conditions for running the Youth Center well. Here, only one point is emphasized: The reason why the Mudanjiang City Youth Center is run so well is also that it starts from the characteristics of young people, breaks many old frameworks, criticizes erroneous ideas such as "regularization" and "uniformization," and adopts various forms of schooling. Only in this way can it adapt to the different needs of young people, meet their requirements, and organize the majority of out-of-school youths in the city into this collective. Here, they study Chairman Mao's works, learn cultural and scientific knowledge, learn productive labor skills, and receive education. This article is worth reading by comrades in Party and government departments and people from all walks of life, especially comrades in education departments and the Communist Youth League in various places.
    The Mudanjiang City Youth Center is an educational organization for urban young people, founded in 1954. Over the past twelve years, under the leadership of the Party, it has held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, earnestly implemented the Party's guidelines and policies, relied on the masses, carried forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle, and continuously improved its work, achieving certain results in organizing and educating young people. Currently, the Youth Center has more than 14,000 young people, who have participated in industrial and agricultural production and other work. Among them, more than 2,600 have participated in rural construction. A small number of people have been promoted to higher-level schools. After taking up various jobs, these young people have worked diligently and worked hard, making contributions to the cause of socialist construction.
    The Youth Center is increasingly demonstrating its great role in organizing and educating urban young people, and its scale is gradually expanding. Since 1963, in addition to the one directly under the city, the streets in various districts and some factories and enterprises have successively established 17 more. The city's 18 Youth Centers have 20 junior and intermediate professional classes in agriculture, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, fruit tree gardening, carpentry, bricklaying, electrical work, sewing, hairdressing, and hygiene, five junior secondary school work-study classes, and 27 self-study detachments (211 self-study groups), with a total of more than 3,150 students. The Youth Center has 13 full-time cadres, 7 teachers, employs 30 part-time teachers, and more than 200 volunteer counselors.
    The direction of running the Youth Center is gradually clarified, the method of running the school is explored and advanced, and the quality of education is gradually improved. In the early stage of its establishment in 1954, it mainly organized out-of-school primary and secondary school graduates to review their lessons, engage in some social activities and cultural and sports activities, and prepare for further education. In 1956, although a group of students were mobilized to reclaim wasteland in the Great Northern Wilderness, the educational thinking at that time did not change, and it was still mainly focused on tutoring culture. After running it for a few years, we saw that it was impossible for primary and secondary school graduates to be completely promoted to higher education after tutoring. In 1957, Chairman Mao proposed: "Our educational policy should enable those who receive education to develop in morality, intelligence, and physical fitness, and become cultured laborers with socialist consciousness." In 1958, the Party Central Committee put forward the policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Since then, political and ideological education and labor education in the Youth Center have been strengthened, and it has been recognized that the Youth Center is mainly preparing students for employment, and the educational activities of the "home" have also become diversified. However, the employment prospects at that time were still oriented towards cities, and the paths were still not wide enough. It was not until after the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party in 1962 that we further summarized the experience of running the Youth Center and gradually clarified the direction of giving prominence to politics and facing the countryside. Since then, the path of the Youth Center has become wider and wider, and the quality of education has also improved significantly.
    After twelve years of practice, especially in recent years, it can be clearly seen that the Youth Center is a very good form of education for urban young people. It is an important position for us to compete with the bourgeoisie for the younger generation, and it is a socialist school for cultivating young people to become strong revolutionary successors. Its role lies in: using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate revolutionary successors and resist the encroachment of bourgeois ideology on young people; making ideological and labor skill preparations for mobilizing urban educated youths to participate in socialist construction, especially to go to the mountains and countryside to build a new socialist countryside. It also plays a role in reasonably arranging the temporary labor force needed in the city, supporting the production and construction of various industries and enlivening street political life, and sharing a part of the task of popularizing secondary school education in the city.
    The following are some of the main experiences of the Youth Center:
    Giving prominence to politics, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate young people to take the revolutionary road
    Politics is the commander, the soul. Political work is the lifeline of all work. This teaching of Comrade Mao Zedong is of particular importance to the Youth Center. The educational objects of the Youth Center are primary and secondary school graduates who have not been admitted to higher-level schools and are not yet qualified for employment. After primary and secondary school education, they have a certain degree of political and ideological awareness. However, they are still young and have not been tempered by actual struggle, and many people lack a correct understanding of their future and life goals. Especially due to the influence of bourgeois ideology and the habits of the old society, many people believe that participating in productive labor, especially agricultural production labor, is not promising, and they are afraid of hardship and fatigue, and they are picky about work when choosing jobs. Some young people cannot withstand the erosion of the ideas of the exploiting classes and have been infected with the bad habits of talking about food and clothing, comparing wealth, and being lazy. All this shows that the struggle between the bourgeoisie and us for young people is very fierce. Therefore, among them, conscientiously doing ideological and political education work, vigorously carrying out the struggle to promote the proletarian and eliminate the bourgeois, and eliminating the influence of the bourgeoisie and all old forces are the most important things to make young people grow up healthily and become strong revolutionary successors.
    In the early stage of the Youth Center's establishment, we lacked a clear understanding of this issue, and only knew to cater to the wishes of young people to enter higher education, focusing on tutoring culture and unilaterally pursuing promotion to higher education. Later, we paid attention to arranging employment, but we did not give prominence to politics. At that time, if employment was not arranged early according to their requirements, some people complained; if employment was arranged, some people picked and chose. Facts have proved that without giving prominence to politics, there is no correct direction, no revolutionary consciousness, no correct attitude towards production or work, and no enthusiasm to make great efforts for socialist revolution and socialist construction.
    After 1958, especially since 1962, the Youth Center summarized and accepted the past experiences and lessons, and strengthened the education of the revolutionary world outlook in response to the active thoughts of urban young people. Organize students to repeatedly study articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Orientation of the Youth Movement" with questions such as "What is the future and ideal of revolutionary youth" and "How to be a good revolutionary successor," and closely combine learning and application. While studying Chairman Mao's works, they also often use various forms such as "Revolutionary Storytelling Meetings," "Recall Bitterness and Think About Sweetness Report Meetings," and visiting the poor and asking about suffering, asking "three olds" to tell the history of the village, the history of the family, and the history of the factory, to talk about class and class struggle, conduct class education, establish class viewpoints, and improve their ability to distinguish right from wrong; talk about revolutionary heroes to establish learning models; talk about revolutionary ambitions to inspire students' enterprising thoughts, so that many students stand higher and see further. In particular, by closely combining the education of the revolutionary world outlook with mobilizing students to go to the mountains and countryside to build a new socialist countryside, students' thinking has become more active. At the meetings to study Chairman Mao's works, students compared themselves with Zhang Side, Norman Bethune, and Lei Feng, found shortcomings, actively examined and criticized the erroneous ideas of fearing the hardship of the countryside, fearing that being a farmer for a lifetime is not promising, and fearing that their studies will be wasted and their talents will be wasted, and improved their class consciousness.
    The Youth Center also pays attention to grasping active thoughts and linking every task and every event of socialist construction with the word "revolution." No matter who it is, as long as they have done a good deed for the revolution and for the collective, they are praised, and they are often organized to learn from good people and good deeds, sing good people and good deeds, and perform good people and good deeds, creating a relatively strong revolutionary atmosphere in the whole "family." This has a very good effect. When they take up production or work, they no longer pick and choose, and they do not limit their vision to their own small circles, but link their future with the country, with the cause of socialism, and with the liberation of the people of the world. With such awareness, understanding that it is for the revolution and for the people, they are not afraid to do anything. In the upsurge of urban educated youths going to the mountains and countryside in 1965, the Youth Center was bustling with enthusiasm, and volunteer forms and determination forms were posted all over the house, and more than 300 people from the Youth Center directly under the city alone signed up to participate in agricultural production.
    In the past two years, the Youth Center has also opened its doors to some young people who have been idle for a long time, have been deeply affected by bourgeois ideology, and have been infected with some bad habits, in order to educate them in the revolutionary collective. Based on finding out the specific reasons for their mistakes, they are educated to read Chairman Mao's books with questions in mind, improve their ideological awareness, encourage them to be positive, warmly care for their learning, and adhere to the method of patient persuasion and guidance. After education, the vast majority of them have been put on the right track. Some have had some problems after going out, and the Youth Center has taken the initiative to take them back, re-educate them, and re-assign them, taking responsibility to the end. Facts have proved that these young people can also be educated well. These young people generally perform well after taking up labor posts, and many have become advanced producers.
    Organize young people to participate in productive labor and social activities, so that they can grow up in the struggle practice of the three major revolutionary movements
    To cultivate the vast number of young people into strong revolutionary successors, so that they can withstand the storms and bear the heavy burdens, it is not enough to just teach them to understand the principles of revolution, but they must also be put into the struggle practice of the three major revolutionary movements to undergo tempering and testing.
    In recent years, the Youth Center has organized young people to participate in various political activities and productive labor according to the principle of learning a little, doing a little, and learning while doing, so that they can establish class viewpoints, labor viewpoints, mass viewpoints, and the idea of serving the people wholeheartedly in class struggle, production struggle, and various service activities. Many students have learned some principles of class struggle from books, newspapers, and "Recall Bitterness and Think About Sweetness Report Meetings," and know some class struggle situations, but they feel that class struggle is far away from them and they do not understand it very well. The Youth Center organized them to participate in the socialist education movement. After they personally participated in socialist education, their ideological understanding changed. Many students used class viewpoints to analyze and criticize their own thoughts of talking about eating, talking about wearing, fearing hardship, and not loving labor, saying that this is the beginning of "peaceful evolution," and if they do not pay attention to changing it, they will slowly deteriorate.
    Some students do not love labor, are unwilling to participate in agricultural production, are afraid of hardship, afraid of getting dirty, and afraid of being looked down upon by others. After education, they know that this kind of thinking is wrong, but before participating in the practice of production struggle, their understanding is still not deep. After organizing them to participate in agriculture, industry, construction, and various public welfare labor, many students gradually have a new understanding of the concept of labor being glorious and not laboring being shameful, and their ideological feelings have undergone great changes. In the past, students did not dare to go to the farm to work, and did not dare to touch the edge of manure. Now, everyone is rushing to work on the farm and rushing to the toilet to dig up manure. In the past, when accumulating manure and transporting manure, they felt ashamed, and transported it at night rather than during the day, and took alleys instead of main streets, and sent livestock manure instead of human manure. Now they dare to pull manure carts on the bustling main roads.
    When the students of the Youth Center participate in temporary social labor, they actively do whatever they are assigned to do, without bargaining. Therefore, many units in the city welcome the students of the Youth Center to participate in labor, praising them as "shock troops." At the same time, the employing units no longer simply use them as labor force as in the past, but also take on the responsibility of educating them.
    Organizing young people to participate in various social service activities also has a significant educational role. The Youth Center organized students to participate in propaganda, general elections, tutoring street children's teams, serving as street "red five members," and doing various service work in shops, restaurants, and bus stations. This has enabled them to understand a lot of situations, especially to experience the ideological feelings of the working people from practice, and to understand the principle that doing all kinds of work is an indispensable part of socialist construction.
    The participation of young people in the practice of revolution and construction can also cultivate the revolutionary style of daring to do and daring to break through. Most students can regard the needs of the revolution as their highest personal aspirations. As long as the Party calls, they are willing to do anything and dare to do anything. Building houses, building roads, being shop assistants, being teachers, going to the "Great Northern Wilderness" to reclaim wasteland, being members of production teams, or running their own farms, they all do very well. In 1956, more than 300 young people who were mobilized by the Youth Center directly under the city to reclaim wasteland in the "Great Northern Wilderness" are now serving as leaders of production teams and sub-farms of the farm. The twelve students who were mobilized to join the team and join the commune in the Tuanshanzi Brigade of Ning'an County in 1964 were all rated as "five-good" youths after one year of labor and became the "collective household" of "full house red." More than 100 young people who were mobilized to settle in the Lotus Youth Farm in the Bohai Commune of Ning'an County in 1965 also made the Lotus Farm bustling, producing more than 200,000 catties of grain for the country.
    Starting from the actual situation, adopt various forms of schooling to meet the different requirements of urban young people
    The form of schooling in the Youth Center must be diversified to meet the different needs of urban young people. Young people are of different ages, different levels of education, and different family economic conditions and personal hobbies. Some are older and have difficult family lives, and they are eager to find employment and cannot study for too long; some are younger and have better family lives and require more years of study. There are also differences in where they live, and some families need them to do some auxiliary labor. Under these complex circumstances, a single form of schooling cannot meet the needs of the masses. The Youth Center has carefully studied this issue, criticized erroneous ideas such as "regularization" and "uniformization," started from the characteristics of urban young people, and implemented a combination of centralized and decentralized organization in accordance with the direction of facing the countryside as the main focus, a combination of work and study in the education method, and a combination of long and short learning years. Teaching content, on the premise of giving prominence to politics, implements a three-in-one combination of politics, culture, and technology. First, organize self-study groups to absorb junior high school and older senior primary school graduates. Those who have work do work, and those who have no work study. They are grouped according to their cultural level and family address, focusing on self-study, studying the main courses of high school or junior high school, and teachers provide regular tutoring. The second is to organize short-term training courses in various majors. According to production needs and students' willingness, training courses in radio, accounting, sewing, carpentry, and bricklaying have been held successively to train laborers with certain expertise for the countryside. This kind of training course is generally four to six months. The third is to run junior and intermediate professional classes for both farming and reading, absorbing junior high school and senior primary school graduates, setting classes and majors, but not setting the number of years of study. Now there are intermediate professional classes in animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, carpentry, bricklaying, electrical work, and hygiene, and there are junior professional classes in agronomy, fruit trees, and hairdressing. The fourth is to organize work-study junior high school classes, absorbing senior primary school graduates under the age of sixteen, and adopting the form of half-day teaching and half-day labor to study the main courses of junior high school. Although there are these forms, there are no strict time limits for enrollment and graduation, and they are sent out when production needs them. The curriculum setting must also be closely combined with production practice. The teaching content is small and practical. What to do, what to learn; what to learn, what to do. Chairman Mao's works are a common compulsory course for all classes. Cultural classes learn more rural applied writing, practical mathematics knowledge, and abacus. Professional classes also only learn one or two basic technical knowledge, in order to combine learning and application and apply what they have learned. This arrangement is practical to teach, lively to learn, and has a good effect. At the same time, the Youth Center also pays attention to carrying out rich and colorful cultural and sports activities according to the characteristics of young people, widely organizes various cultural and sports activity groups, often carries out various military sports activities, and organizes students to write and perform revolutionary dramas and songs and dances that reflect the good people and good deeds in the "home" and reflect the learning life. After school, there is often a sound of drums and music, and the singing is loud, which enlivens the learning life and inspires revolutionary enthusiasm.
    The reason why the Youth Center can organize the majority of young people in the city is that adopting various forms of schooling is a very important condition.
    Rely on the masses to run the "home" and establish an educational team that combines full-time cadres and teachers with part-time teachers and counselors
    To run the Youth Center, we must rely on the masses, and with the help of the state, mobilize the strength of all departments and factories, enterprises, streets, and other aspects in the city; we must have a group of backbones who are highly conscious, energetic, unafraid of hardship, and unafraid of difficulties, and rely on this group of backbones to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses. This is what we have emphasized since the day we started, and we have always insisted on doing so.
    At present, the city's 18 Youth Centers are jointly run by relevant departments, factories, enterprises, and streets. Although there are only 20 full-time cadres and teachers running the "home," more than 500 people actually participate in this educational work. Among them, more than 200 are parents of students, who are not afraid of trouble, arrange self-study groups in their own homes, and take the initiative to serve as counselors for the groups. There are also more than 200 active elements selected from among the young students, who not only study but also tutor the students. There are also dozens of workers, doctors, teachers, and cadres from all walks of life who have certain professional knowledge and skills. They also assist the Youth Center in carrying out professional learning activities without complaint. Many agencies, enterprises, schools, and street organizations have done a lot of work to run the Youth Center well. Without the support of the broad masses, it would be impossible to do a good job in organizing and educating thousands of young people by relying only on 20 full-time cadres.
    Creating the Youth Center and engaging in urban youth education work is a new thing, and it is also a very complex organizational work. We must have people who are courageous in practice and dare to break the road to be the backbone. When the Municipal Party Committee decided to establish the Youth Center in 1954, it sent comrades such as Dong Kerang to do this work. At that time, the conditions were very poor, but they did not complain or retreat in the face of difficulties. They often ran to factories, went to the streets, visited the masses, mobilized students, actively publicized the purpose and significance of establishing the Youth Center, and studied and planned with the masses, and finally explored the method of establishing detachments by district, organizing groups by street, and combining decentralized self-study with centralized activities, organizing the out-of-school senior primary school graduates, laying a good foundation for the consolidation and improvement of the Youth Center in the future.
    Under the cultivation and education of the Party, many comrades in the Youth Center, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of difficulties, and with the revolutionary spirit of daring to do and daring to break through, have created conditions for students to participate in agricultural production. The Youth Center wanted to run a farm, but no one understood agriculture. What to do? Under this situation, An Yansen, a college graduate who was newly assigned to work here, stepped forward and entered the mountain ditch with his luggage. When he arrived at the farm, there was a broken house that leaked wind and rain, and there were many difficulties. However, Comrade An Yansen did not bow his head in the face of difficulties. He shared weal and woe with the students, farmers, and workers, and worked hard for more than a year, changing the face of the farm. An Yansen himself has also been tempered and has made great strides forward on the road of revolutionization, becoming a "all-around expert" in agriculture.
    To run the Youth Center well, we must also pay attention to discovering and cultivating "volunteer soldiers" - counselors who have close ties with the masses and are enthusiastic about serving the masses among young people. They are both teachers and students, and can unite the vast number of young people, manage themselves, educate themselves, teach each other, and form a mass-based and powerful educational force. Wu Shuqin, the counselor of the fruit tree class of the Youth Center, is a model among the "volunteer soldiers." She has been working, studying, and giving prominence to politics in the orchard for three years as if it were a day, always taking the lead, establishing a democratic and equal teacher-student relationship with the students, trusting each other, and giving full play to the students' enthusiasm. Chu Qiuzhen, the political counselor of the Youth Center of the Chang'an Street Subdistrict Office, is also an excellent "volunteer soldier." She and four other counselors are jointly responsible for the work of the Chang'an Street Youth Center. She studies Chairman Mao's works with the students, and uses what she has learned. In the process of building the "home," she worked hard with the young people to make adobe, hit stones, and build houses, changing the face of the "home." These "volunteer soldiers" are active elements in school, and they are the leaders of young people going to the mountains and countryside. Qu Jingwen, a "volunteer soldier" of the Youth Center directly under the city, took the lead in signing up and took the initiative to persuade her parents and mobilize her classmates to go to the countryside when she mobilized students to go to the countryside in 1965. After arriving at the Lotus Farm, she still took the lead in everything. Wherever there were difficulties, she went there. The students affectionately called her "our female political commissar."
    People are the first factor. Relying on backbones, cultivating a large number of "volunteer soldiers," and establishing a youth education work team that combines professional cadres, teachers, part-time teachers, and counselors are the basic conditions for implementing the mass line and widely mobilizing the masses to do a good job in youth education.
    Self-reliance, thrift in running the "home"
    The Youth Center must be "run indigenously" and "run poorly," relying on self-reliance and hard struggle. This is not only to save state funds, but also a question of what kind of thinking is used to educate people. When building the "home," some people envisioned building a large "home" with beautiful houses and good equipment. However, it is impossible to run the "home" according to this idea. What to do? It is still necessary to "run indigenously" and "run poorly." So the three cadres in charge of building the "home" rushed among the broad masses, mobilized the masses to come up with ideas and find ways, and adopted the method of "thousands of households are classrooms, and factories and streets are training grounds," organizing hundreds of self-study groups and setting them up in the homes of hundreds of basic masses. Vegetable sheds, factory clubs, and theaters were all borrowed to give lectures, make reports, and carry out collective activities. By doing this, the Youth Center was established without spending much money or taking much time.
    In the process of development, the Youth Center constantly puts forward new requirements and needs more material conditions. Some people advocate doing it themselves, and some people advocate reaching out to ask for it. The Youth Center criticized the latter idea and decided to create conditions by themselves. They repaired and built more than 1,000 square meters of activity venues and added many equipment.
    The "home" business is big, the conditions are good, is it to continue to work hard, work hard, and run the "home" thriftily, or to spend money lavishly and show off? The Youth Center has encountered this problem. They built a gate themselves. But in order to "look good" and "look like," they spent more than 200 yuan to hire someone to carve the nine characters "Mudanjiang City Youth Center" and inlaid them on the horizontal bar of the gate. Later, when checking the idea of running the "home" thriftily, they realized that they had suffered a defeat in their thinking. Poor days should be spent poorly, and rich days should also be spent poorly. In the past two years, the Youth Center has continued to carry forward the spirit of self-reliance, hard struggle, hard work, and thrift in running the "home," and has built a farm with more than 60 hectares of land. Now there are herds of cattle and horses, flocks of pigs and sheep, and surplus grain and vegetables. They have also expanded the orchard, built a small meteorological station, filled a large depression, and built a vegetable garden. Life is getting better and better, and the atmosphere of running the "home" thriftily is getting stronger and stronger. These experiences and lessons have made the comrades of the Youth Center deeply realize that if you do everything yourself, people will have a revolutionary spirit, and the "home" will have a revolutionary atmosphere.
    Strengthen the leadership of the Party and give full play to the role of relevant departments
    The fundamental reason why the Youth Center has been able to achieve some results is that it has strengthened the leadership of the Party. Running the Youth Center is a major event to cultivate revolutionary successors and compete with the bourgeoisie for the next generation, and it is a major event to organize the vast number of young people to participate in socialist revolution and construction. The Party must strengthen its leadership.
    For the Youth Center, the leadership of the Party lies first in guiding a correct direction for running the "home." In the process of the Youth Center's establishment, consolidation, and development, it is full of the struggle between two lines, two ideologies, and two methods. For example, should it be run or not? Should it be "run in a foreign way" and "run richly," or should it be "run indigenously" and "run poorly"? Should it rely solely on the state to provide money, or should it be based on self-reliance? Should it engage in so-called "regularization," or should it start from reality, adopt various forms, and be flexible and diverse? Should we implement the policy of facing the countryside? And so on. There are two different views on many of these fundamental issues. The Youth Center has been constantly exploring, learning, and struggling along the direction pointed out by the Party, constantly overcoming erroneous views, and firmly implementing correct views.
    The educational objects of the Youth Center determine the mass nature and complexity of its work. It is necessary to manage organization, manage ideology, manage learning, manage labor, manage life, and manage employment arrangements, which will inevitably involve contact with all aspects of society and inevitably lead to various contradictions with many aspects. Therefore, to run the Youth Center well and do a good job in urban youth education, it is not enough to rely on any one department. We have strengthened the organizational leadership of the Youth Center by establishing a Youth Education Work Committee, headed by the leaders of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, and absorbing relevant departments such as the Planning Commission, Education, Labor, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation to regularly study and solve major problems in the work of running the "home," which has played a great role in doing a good job in the Youth Center.
    Although the Youth Center in our city has a history of twelve years, there are still many problems in its work, such as ideological and political work, teaching work, labor arrangement, and resettlement work. There are still many weak links, and some problems have not yet been explored. In the future, we must further strengthen the leadership of the Youth Center, so that the Youth Center can be further consolidated and improved on the existing basis, and the work of organizing and educating urban young people can be done better, making greater contributions to socialist revolution and socialist construction.

    编者按：把城市青少年统统管好教好，是在教育战线上的一场严重的兴无产阶级思想、灭资产阶级思想的阶级斗争。无产阶级要以自己的世界观，以毛泽东思想教育新的一代，使他们成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，成为无产阶级革命事业的接班人。资产阶级也以自己的世界观，千方百计地用腐朽的思想，去影响和腐蚀青少年，妄图把他们拉过去，成为他们的接班人。无产阶级同资产阶级争夺下一代的斗争，也是长期的、曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。
    我们的任务就是采取多种多样的形式和办法，把城市青少年管好教好。牡丹江市青少年之家就是向青少年进行社会主义教育，同资产阶级争夺下一代的一个重要阵地。
    中共牡丹江市委员会的这篇文章，对于青少年的教育，提出了许多重要问题，如突出政治，用毛泽东思想教育青少年走革命化的道路；加强党的领导，把青少年之家引向一个正确的方向，各有关部门和群众团体协同解决办“家”工作中的重大问题；办“家”中贯彻执行群众路线，以及发扬自力更生、勤俭办学的革命精神等。这些都是办好青少年之家的重要条件。这里只着重说明一点：牡丹江市青少年之家所以办得好，还在于从青少年的特点出发，打破了许多旧的框框，批判了“正规化”、“一律化”等错误思想，采取了多种办学形式。这样，才能适应青少年的不同需要，满足他们的要求，才能把全市大多数未升学的青少年都组织到这个集体里来。他们在这里学习毛主席著作，学习文化科学知识，学会了生产劳动本领，受到了教育。这篇文章，值得党、政部门的同志和各方面的人们，特别是各地教育部门、共青团的同志一读。
    牡丹江市青少年之家，是城市青少年的教育组织，创建于一九五四年。十二年来，它在党的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，认真贯彻执行党的方针政策，依靠群众，发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗的革命精神，不断改进自己的工作，在组织教育青少年的工作中，取得了一定的成绩。现在，青少年之家已有一万四千多名青少年，先后参加了工农业生产和其他工作。其中，参加农村建设的有二千六百多人。少数人升入了高一级学校。这些青少年走上各个工作岗位以后，辛勤劳动，努力工作，为社会主义建设事业做出了贡献。
    青少年之家在组织教育城市青少年的工作中，日益显示出它的巨大作用，规模也逐渐扩大。一九六三年以来，除了市直属的一所外，各区的街道和一些工厂企业又陆续举办了十七所。全市十八所青少年之家设有农业、畜牧兽医、果树园艺、木工、瓦工、电工、缝纫、理发、卫生等二十个初、中级专业班，五个初中工读班，二十七个自学中队（二百一十一个自学小组），共有学生三千一百五十多人。青少年之家设有专职干部十三人，教师七人，聘请兼职教员三十人，义务辅导员二百余人。
    青少年之家办学的方向是逐渐明确的，办学的方法是摸索前进的，教育质量也是逐步提高的。一九五四年创办初期，主要是组织未升学的中小学毕业生复习功课，搞些社会活动和文体活动，为继续升学做准备。一九五六年，虽然动员了一批学生到北大荒垦荒，但当时的办学思想并未改变，仍然以抓补习文化为主。办了几年以后，我们看到，要使中小学毕业生经过补习完全升学是不可能的。一九五七年，毛主席提出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”一九五八年，党中央提出了教育为无产阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。从此，才加强了青少年之家的政治思想教育和劳动教育，认识到青少年之家主要是为学生就业做准备，“家”的教育活动也多样化起来。但是，那时的就业出路还是面向城市，路子仍然不广。直到一九六二年党的八届十中全会以后，我们进一步总结了办青少年之家的经验，逐步明确了政治挂帅、面向农村的方向。自此，青少年之家的路子越走越宽，教育质量也有了显著的提高。
    经过十二年的实践，特别是近几年来的实践，可以清楚地看到：青少年之家是对城市青少年进行教育的很好形式。它是我们同资产阶级争夺青少年一代的重要阵地，是培养青少年成为坚强的革命后代的社会主义学校。它的作用就在于：用毛泽东思想培养革命接班人，抵制资产阶级思想对青少年的侵袭；为动员城市知识青年参加社会主义建设，特别是为上山下乡建设社会主义新农村做好思想上和劳动技能上的准备。它还起到合理安排城市临时需要的劳动力，支援各行各业生产建设和活跃街道政治生活的作用，并分担一部分城市普及中学教育的任务。
    下面是青少年之家的一些主要经验：
    政治挂帅，用毛泽东思想教育青少年走革命化的道路
    政治是统帅，是灵魂。政治工作是一切工作的生命线。毛泽东同志的这一教导，对于青少年之家来说，尤其具有特殊的重要意义。青少年之家的教育对象是未升入高一级学校、暂时还不具备就业条件的中小学毕业生。他们经过中小学教育，具有一定的政治思想觉悟。但是，他们年龄还小，没有经过实际斗争的锻炼，有许多人对于自己的前途和生活目的还缺乏正确的理解。特别是由于资产阶级思想和旧社会习惯势力的影响，不少人认为参加生产劳动尤其是农业生产劳动没有出息，怕苦、怕累，在选择工作时拈轻怕重。有些青少年经不起剥削阶级思想的侵蚀，沾染了讲吃穿、比阔气、好逸恶劳的恶习。这一切都说明，资产阶级同我们争夺青少年的斗争是十分激烈的。因此，在他们中间，认真做好思想政治教育工作，大力开展兴无灭资的斗争，清除资产阶级和一切旧势力的影响，是使青少年健康成长，成为坚强的革命后代的最重要的事情。
    青少年之家创办初期，我们对于这个问题缺乏明确的认识，只知道迎合青少年升学的愿望，大抓补习文化，片面追求升学。后来注意了安排就业，也没有政治挂帅。那时，如果没有按照他们的要求早安排就业，有人发怨言；安排了就业，又有人挑肥拣瘦。事实证明：没有政治挂帅，就没有正确的方向，没有革命的觉悟，没有对待生产或工作的正确态度，也就没有为社会主义革命和社会主义建设出大力的积极性。
    一九五八年以后，特别是从一九六二年以来，青少年之家总结和接受了过去的经验教训，针对城市青少年的活思想，加强了革命世界观的教育。组织学生带着“什么是革命青年的前途和理想”，“怎样当好革命接班人”等问题，反复学习《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《青年运动的方向》等文章，把学和用密切结合起来。在学习毛主席著作的同时，还经常用“革命故事会”、“忆苦思甜报告会”，以及访贫问苦，请“三老”讲村史、家史、厂史等多种形式，大讲阶级与阶级斗争，进行阶级教育，树立阶级观点，提高他们辨别是非的能力；大讲革命英雄人物，树立学习榜样；大讲革命雄心壮志，启发学生奋发向上的思想，从而使许多学生站得高了，看得远了。特别是把革命世界观的教育与动员学生上山下乡建设社会主义新农村密切地结合在一起，学生的思想更加活跃了。在学习毛主席著作的会上，学生纷纷同张思德、白求恩、雷锋作比较，找差距，主动检查和批判怕农村艰苦，怕干一辈子农民没出息，怕荒废了学业，屈了人材等错误思想，提高了阶级觉悟。
    青少年之家还很注意抓活思想，把社会主义建设的每件工作、每件事情都同“革命”二字联系起来。不管是谁，只要是为革命、为集体做了一件好事，就进行表扬，并常常组织他们学好人好事，唱好人好事，演好人好事，在全“家”造成比较浓厚的革命气氛。这样做效果很好。他们在走上生产或工作岗位的时候，不再挑肥拣瘦，不是把眼光只限于个人的小圈子里，而是把自己的前途同国家、同社会主义事业，同世界人民的解放联系起来。有了这样的觉悟，懂得了为革命，为人民，干什么都不怕了。在一九六五年全市知识青年上山下乡的热潮中，青少年之家闹的热火朝天，志愿书和决心书贴得满屋满墙，仅市直属的一所青少年之家就有三百多人报名参加农业生产。
    近两年来，青少年之家对于一些闲散较久，受资产阶级思想侵袭和影响较深，沾染上一些坏习气的青少年，也敞开大门，热情欢迎他们，以便把他们放在革命的集体之中进行教育。在摸清他们产生错误的具体原因的基础上，教育他们带着问题读毛主席的书，提高他们的思想觉悟，鼓励他们积极向上，热情关怀他们的学习，并且坚持耐心说服和诱导的方法。经过教育已使其中绝大多数人走上了正路。有的出去后又出了一些毛病，青少年之家就主动收回来，再教育，再分配，负责到底。事实证明，这些青少年同样是可以教育好的。这些青少年走上劳动岗位以后，一般表现是好的，而且不少人已成为先进生产者。
    组织青少年参加生产劳动和社会活动，使他们在三大革命运动的斗争实践中锻炼成长
    要把广大青少年培养成为坚强的革命后代，使他们经得起风浪，挑得起重担，只教他们懂得革命的道理是不够的，还必须把他们放到三大革命运动的斗争实践中去经受锻炼和考验。
    近几年来，青少年之家按照学一点，做一点，边干边学的原则，组织青少年参加各种政治活动和生产劳动，让他们在阶级斗争、生产斗争和各项服务活动中，树立阶级观点、劳动观点、群众观点和全心全意为人民服务的思想。许多学生从书本、报刊和“忆苦思甜报告会”中，学到了一些阶级斗争的道理，知道了一些阶级斗争情况，但又觉得阶级斗争离自己很远，不甚了然。青少年之家就组织他们参加社会主义教育运动。他们亲自参加了社会主义教育以后，思想认识就起了变化。许多学生用阶级观点分析批判自己讲吃、讲穿、怕苦、不爱劳动的思想，说这就是“和平演变”的开始，不注意改，慢慢就会变质。
    有些学生不爱劳动，不愿参加农业生产，怕苦、怕脏、怕别人看不起，经过教育，他们知道这种思想不对，但在没有参加生产斗争的实践以前，认识还是不深刻的。在组织他们参加了农业、工业、建筑和各种公益劳动以后，许多学生就逐步对劳动光荣与不劳动可耻的概念有了新的理解，思想感情发生了很大变化。过去，学生不敢到农场去劳动，不敢沾大粪的边。现在，人人争先上农场劳动，争先下厕所刨大粪。过去积肥运粪，觉得害羞，白天不运夜间运，不走大街走小巷，不送人粪送畜粪。现在却敢拉着粪车走在熙熙攘攘的大马路上。
    青少年之家的学生在参加社会临时性劳动时分配他们干什么，都积极去做，不讲价钱。所以，市内不少单位都欢迎青少年之家的学生来参加劳动，称赞他们是“突击队”。同时，各用工单位不再象过去那样单纯地把他们当作劳动力来使用，也承担起教育他们的责任。
    组织青少年参加各种社会服务活动，也有着显著的教育作用。青少年之家组织学生参加了宣传、普选、辅导街道幼儿队，当街道“红五员”，到商店、饭店、汽车站做各种服务工作。这使他们了解了不少的情况，特别是从实践中体会了劳动人民的思想感情，理解了做各种工作都是社会主义建设不可缺少的组成部分的道理。
    青少年参加革命和建设的实践，还能够培养学生敢干敢闯的革命风格。大多数学生能以革命的需要当成个人的最高志愿，只要党一号召，他们什么都愿意干，都敢干。盖房子、筑路、当店员、当教师，到“北大荒”去垦荒，到生产队当社员，或者自己办农场，都干的很好。一九五六年，市直属的青少年之家动员到“北大荒”垦荒的三百多名青年，现在有的担任了农场生产队和分场的领导职务。一九六四年动员到宁安县团山子大队插队入社的十二名学生，经过一年劳动，全都被评为“五好”青年，成为“满堂红”的“集体户”。一九六五年动员去宁安县渤海公社莲花青年农场落户的一百多名青年，也把个莲花农场闹得热气腾腾，为国家生产了二十多万斤粮食。
    从实际情况出发，采取多种形式办学，适应城市青少年的不同要求
    青少年之家的办学形式必须多样化，以适应城市青少年的不同需要。青少年的年龄有大有小，文化程度有高有低，家庭的经济情况与个人的志愿爱好也各不相同。有些年龄较大、家庭生活有困难的，他们急于要求就业，学习期间不能过长；有些年龄较小，家庭生活又较好的就要求多学几年。居住也有远有近，有些人的家庭还需要他们做一些辅助劳动。在这种错综复杂的情况下，单一的办学形式，满足不了群众的要求。青少年之家认真研究了这个问题，批判了“正规化”、“一律化”等错误思想，从城市青少年的特点出发，按照面向农村为主的方向，组织形式实行集中与分散相结合，教育方法实行工读相结合，学习的年限实行长短相结合，教学内容在政治挂帅的前提下，实行政治、文化、技术三结合。一是组织自学小组，吸收初中和年龄较大的高小毕业生参加。有工做工，无工读书，按文化水平和家庭住址分组，以自学为主，学习高中或初中的主要课程，教师定期辅导。二是组织各种专业的短期训练班。根据生产需要和学生自愿，先后办了无线电、财会、缝纫、木瓦工等训练班，为农村培养具有一定专长的劳动者。这种训练班一般四至六个月。三是办边农边读的初、中级专业班，吸收初中、高小毕业生参加，定班级、定专业，不定学习年限。现在有畜牧兽医、木工、瓦工、电工、卫生等中级专业班，有农学、果树、理发等初级专业班。四是组织工读初中班，吸收不满十六周岁的高小毕业生，采取半日授课、半日劳动的形式，学习初中主要课程。虽然有这些形式，但是入学和出校都不做严格的时间限制，生产需要就输送出去。课程的设置，也要密切结合生产实际。教学内容少而实用。做什么，学什么；学什么，做什么。毛主席著作是各班的共同必修课。文化课多学一些农村应用文、实用数学知识和珠算。专业课也只学一、二种基础技术知识，以求学用结合，学以致用。这样安排，教得切合实际，学得生动活泼，效果很好。同时，青少年之家还很注意根据青少年的特点，开展丰富多采的文化体育活动，广泛组织了各种文化体育活动小组，经常开展各种军事体育活动，组织学生自编自演反映“家”内的好人好事，反映学习生活的革命剧和歌舞。课余时间经常是鼓乐喧天，歌声嘹亮，活跃了学习生活，激发了革命热情。
    青少年之家所以能够把全市大多数青少年组织起来，采取多种形式办学是一个十分重要的条件。
    依靠群众办“家”，建立一支专职干部、教师与兼职教师、辅导员相结合的教育队伍
    办青少年之家，必须依靠群众，在国家帮助下，发动全市各部门和工厂企业、街道等各方面的力量；要有一批觉悟高，干劲大，不畏艰苦，不怕困难的骨干，并且依靠这批骨干调动广大群众的积极性。这是我们从创办那天起就强调的，也是坚持这样做的。
    目前，全市十八所青少年之家，是由有关部门和工厂企业、街道共同努力办起来的。办“家”的专职干部和教师虽然仅有二十人，但实际参与这项教育工作的则有五百多人。其中有二百多人是学生家长，他们不怕麻烦，把自学小组安排在自己家里，并主动担当小组的辅导员。还有二百多人是选自青少年学生中的积极分子，他们一面学习，一面对学生进行辅导。还有几十名各行各业具有一定专业知识和技能的工人、医生、教师、干部，他们也是不辞辛苦地协助青少年之家开展专业学习活动。还有许多机关、企业、学校和街道组织，都为办好青少年之家做了很多工作。如果没有广大群众支持，仅仅依靠二十名专职干部，要做好几千名青少年的组织教育工作是根本不可能的。
    创办青少年之家，搞城市青少年教育工作，是个新事物，而且是个很复杂的组织工作，一定要有勇于实践、敢于闯路的人做骨干。市委在一九五四年决定创办青少年之家时，派了董克让等几位同志去做这一工作。当时条件很差，但是他们在困难面前不叫苦，不退缩，他们经常跑工厂、下街道、访问群众、动员学生，积极宣传建立青少年之家的目的和意义，与群众一起研究筹划，终于摸索出分片建立中队，按街组织小组，分散自学与集中活动相结合的办法，把没有升学的高小毕业生组织起来，为后来青少年之家的巩固提高，打下了良好的基础。
    在党的培养教育下，青少年之家的许多同志，不怕苦，不怕难，有敢干敢闯的革命劲头，为学生参加农业生产创造了条件。青少年之家要办个农场，可是谁也不懂农业，怎么办？在这种情况下，新分配到这里来工作的大学毕业生安严森挺身而出，背着行李进了山沟。到了农场，一栋破房屋，透风漏雨，困难很多。但是安严森同志在困难面前没有低头，他和学生、农民、工人同甘苦，艰苦奋斗一年多，改变了农场的面貌。安严森自己也受到了锻炼，在革命化的道路上大踏步前进，变成了一个农业上的“全把式”。
    办好青少年之家，还必须注意发现和培养青少年中与群众有密切联系的、热心为群众服务的“志愿兵”——辅导员。他们既是教师，又是学生，能够团结广大青少年，自己管理自己、教育自己，互教互学，形成群众性的强大的教育力量。青少年之家果树班辅导员吴淑琴，是“志愿兵”中的标兵。她三年如一日，同学生劳动在果园，学习在果园，政治挂帅，事事走在前头，与同学们建立了民主平等的师生关系，互相信任，充分发挥了同学们的积极性。长安街街道办事处青少年之家的政治辅导员褚秋珍，也是一个优秀的“志愿兵”。她同另外四名辅导员，共同负责长安街青少年之家的工作。她同学生一起学习毛主席著作，并且学了就用，在建“家”过程中，和青少年一道脱大坯，打石头，盖房子，艰苦奋斗，改变了“家”的面貌。这些“志愿兵”，在校是积极分子，上山下乡是青少年的带头人。市直属青少年之家的“志愿兵”曲敬文，在一九六五年动员学生下乡时，她带头报名，并主动去说服家长，动员同学一起下乡。到了莲花农场以后，她仍然处处起带头作用，哪里有困难就到哪里去，同学们都亲切地叫她是“我们的女政委”。
    人的因素第一，依靠骨干，培养大批“志愿兵”，建立一支专业干部、教师与兼职教师、辅导员相结合的青少年教育工作队伍，是贯彻执行群众路线，广泛发动群众做好青少年教育工作的基本条件。
    自力更生，勤俭办“家”
    青少年之家必须“土办”，“穷办”，靠自力更生，艰苦奋斗。这不仅是为了节约国家经费，而且是用什么思想教育人的问题。建“家”时，有人设想办个大的“家”，房子漂亮点，设备好一点。可是，按照这个思想办“家”，根本行不通。怎么办？还是要“土办”，“穷办”。于是负责建“家”的三名干部奔走在广大群众之中，发动群众出主意想办法，采取了“千家万户是课堂，工厂街道是练兵场”的办法，组织了几百个自学小组，设在几百户基本群众家里。菜棚子、工厂俱乐部、影剧院，都借来上大课，作报告，开展集体活动。这样搞，没花几个钱，没用多少时间就把青少年之家办起来了。
    青少年之家在发展过程中，不断提出新的要求，需要更多的物质条件。有人主张自己动手去搞，有人主张伸手向上要。青少年之家批判了后一种思想，决定自己动手创造条件，他们共修补和新建了一千多平方米的活动场所，还增添了许多设备。
    “家”业大了，条件好了，是继续穷干、苦干，勤俭持“家”，还是大手大脚，摆阔气讲排场？青少年之家遇到过这个问题。他们自己动手修了一个大门。但为了“图好看”，“象个样”，却花了二百多元雇人雕了“牡丹江市青少年之家”九个大字，镶在大门的横栏上。后来在检查勤俭办“家”的思想时，他们认识到这是在思想上打了一次败仗。穷日子要穷过，富日子也应当穷过。近二年来，青少年之家继续发扬自力更生，艰苦奋斗，穷干苦干，勤俭办“家”的精神，办了一处有六十多垧地的农场，现在已是牛马成群，猪羊满圈，粮菜有余。他们还扩大了果园，建起了小气象站，填平了一个大洼塘，建起了蔬菜园地。日子过得越来越好，勤俭办“家”的风气也越来越浓。这些经验教训，使青少年之家的同志深刻体会到：凡事自己动手，人有革命精神，“家”就有革命风气。
    加强党的领导，充分发挥各有关部门的作用
    青少年之家所以能够取得一些成绩，根本的一条是加强了党的领导。办青少年之家，是培养革命后代、同资产阶级争夺下一代的大事情，是组织广大青少年参加社会主义革命和建设的大事情，党必须加强领导。
    对青少年之家来说，党的领导首先在于引导一个正确的办“家”方向。在青少年之家的创办、巩固和发展过程中，充满了两条路线、两种思想、两种方法的斗争。比如办不办？是“洋办”、“富办”，还是“土办”、“穷办”？是单靠国家拿钱，还是以自力更生为主？是搞所谓“正规化”，还是从实际出发，多种形式，灵活多样？要不要贯彻面向农村的方针？等等，这许多原则问题都有两种不同的主张。青少年之家沿着党所指引的方向，不断摸索、学习、斗争，不断克服错误的主张，坚定地实行正确的主张。
    青少年之家的教育对象，决定了它的工作的群众性和复杂性。要管组织、管思想、管学习、管劳动、管生活、管就业安排，这就必然要同社会各个方面发生联系，必然要同许多方面发生这样那样的矛盾。因此，办好青少年之家，搞好城市青少年教育工作，只依靠哪一个部门是不行的。我们通过建立青少年教育工作委员会的办法，由市委、市人委领导同志挂帅，吸收计委、教育、劳动、共青团、妇联等有关部门参加，定期研究和解决办“家”工作中的重大问题，加强对青少年之家的组织领导，这对搞好青少年之家的工作，起了很大的作用。
    我市青少年之家虽然已有十二年的历史，工作中还存在不少问题，如思想政治工作、教学工作、劳动安排和安置工作，还有不少薄弱环节，有些问题还没有摸到它的规律。今后要进一步加强对青少年之家的领导，使青少年之家在现有的基础上，进一步巩固提高，把城市青少年组织教育工作做得更好，为社会主义革命和社会主义建设做出更大的贡献。（附图片）
