    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, 7th. Tens of thousands of Kabul citizens held a grand rally at the Ghazi Stadium here this afternoon to welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife, as well as other Chinese guests.

    The weather was clear, and the flags of China and Afghanistan fluttered in the breeze over this large stadium located beneath snow-capped mountains, filled with a festive atmosphere. The 30,000 seats in the stadium were fully occupied, and every available space and nearby rooftops were filled with people.

    Chairman Liu and his wife, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, Vice Minister Zhang Hanfu, and other Chinese guests were escorted to the rostrum by Afghan Prime Minister Maiwandwal, President of the Afghan-China Friendship Association Prince Sultan, and Court Minister Ali Muhammad. When they appeared on the stage, the crowd erupted in a storm of cheers and applause.

    Among those attending the rally were Marshal Wali Khan, uncle of the King, ministers, the Governor of Kabul Province, other senior military and government officials, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Afghanistan.

    Chinese Ambassador to Afghanistan Chen Feng and Afghan Ambassador to China Mohammad Asef Sohail also attended the rally.

    Kabul Mayor Mohammad Asghar delivered a welcoming speech. He said that this welcome rally demonstrated the Afghan people's feelings towards the Chinese people.

    He said: "In modern history, the heroic Chinese people's struggle against foreign forces has always received the sympathy and admiration of the freedom-loving Afghan people. The Afghan people are aware of the great achievements made by the People's Republic of China in the past sixteen and a half years. The strengthening of friendly relations between Afghanistan and China is beneficial to the people of both countries and world peace." He said that the Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression and the Border Treaty signed between Afghanistan and China have played a significant role in strengthening relations between the two countries.

    He said: "Although our two countries have different political systems, the friendly relations between Afghanistan and China have been developing steadily thanks to the vision and sincerity of the great leaders of our two countries."

    He expressed his full belief that the friendship between Afghanistan and China will not only bring fruitful results to the people of both countries, but also play an effective role in safeguarding peace in the Asian region.

    In his speech (full text on page 3), Chairman Liu Shaoqi first expressed his heartfelt gratitude for the warm welcome from the citizens of Kabul.

    Chairman Liu said: "The Afghan people love independence and freedom. You have repeatedly defeated the armed attacks of imperialism and have never bowed your heads before the aggressors." He said, "The Afghan people are hardworking and intelligent people. You have created a glorious and splendid culture in history. Today, you are working hard to change the face of your country. Under the leadership of His Majesty the King, Afghanistan has made many achievements in developing its national economy and national culture."

    Referring to the friendly relations between the two countries, Chairman Liu pointed out that the traditional friendship between China and Afghanistan has seen new developments since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. He said: "For more than a decade, no matter what great storms have arisen internationally, the friendship between our two peoples has always developed. Such a time-tested friendship is a precious friendship. Let our two peoples work together to develop this friendship for a long time to come!"

    Chairman Liu pointed out that Asian and African countries are facing the arduous task of developing national economies and shaking off poverty and backwardness. "Our Asian and African countries all have hardworking and intelligent people, and all have abundant resources. The Chinese people have learned from their own experience that as long as we make full use of these favorable conditions, independent and self-reliant national economies can be developed, and the poverty and backwardness caused by long-term imperialist plunder can be changed."

    Chairman Liu said: "Self-reliance in construction does not exclude international cooperation, and it first requires mutual exchange and mutual support between our Asian and African countries." He said, "It is our bounden duty to provide economic assistance to Asian and African countries within our capacity." He said, "When we provide assistance, we strictly respect the sovereignty of the recipient countries, never attach any conditions, and never demand any privileges. We oppose using aid for control and plunder. Our purpose in providing assistance is to help recipient countries gradually embark on the road of self-reliance." He said, "Considering assistance as a unilateral gift, and thinking that one is superior after providing assistance, is a bad great-power chauvinistic attitude, which we resolutely oppose."

    Chairman Liu concluded by saying: "In order to oppose imperialism and old and new colonialism and promote the cause of independence and progress in Asian and African countries, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand together with the Afghan people and with the people of other Asian and African countries, supporting each other and fighting together."

    Chairman Liu's speech was repeatedly interrupted by enthusiastic applause from the crowd.

    Then, representatives of the Kabul Municipal Government presented gifts to Chairman Liu. Chairman Liu also presented gifts in return to the Kabul Municipal Government.

    After performing the most popular Afghan folk dance, the Atan dance, a goat-grabbing competition was held, which is usually held by the Afghan people during grand ceremonies and solemn festivals.

    Before the competition, the goat-grabbing riders lined up on horseback to pay tribute to the Chinese guests on the rostrum.

    In the competition, the riders showed great courage and strength, winning the welcome of tens of thousands of spectators.

    After the competition, Chairman Liu presented awards to the riders and gave gifts.

    刘少奇主席在喀布尔市民欢迎大会上说
    亚非国家有条件发展独立自主的民族经济
    中国愿帮助受援国家走上自力更生的道路
    阿斯加尔市长说，阿中友好关系的加强有利于两国人民和世界和平
    新华社喀布尔七日电　数万喀布尔市民七日下午在这里的加齐体育场举行盛大集会，欢迎刘少奇主席和夫人以及其他中国客人。
    天气晴朗，在这个位于白雪覆盖的山岭下的宽大的体育场上，中国和阿富汗两国国旗迎风招展，充满了节日的欢乐气氛。体育场上的三万个座位坐得满满的，每一个空隙地方和附近的屋顶上都站满了人。
    刘主席和夫人，陈毅副总理和夫人，章汉夫副部长和其他中国客人由阿富汗首相迈万德瓦尔、阿中友好协会会长苏尔坦亲王，宫廷大臣阿里·穆罕默德陪同走上了主席台。当他们出现在台上的时候，群众发出暴风雨般的欢呼声和掌声。
    出席大会的有国王的叔父瓦利·汗元帅、大臣们、喀布尔省省长和其他高级军政官员和各国驻阿富汗的外交使节。
    中国驻阿富汗大使陈枫和阿富汗驻中国大使穆罕默德·阿沙夫·苏海尔也出席了大会。
    喀布尔市长穆罕默德·阿斯加尔致欢迎词。他说，这个欢迎大会表现了阿富汗人民对中国人民的感情。
    他说：“在近代史中，英雄的中国人民反对外国势力的斗争，一向得到爱好自由的阿富汗人民的同情和赞扬。阿富汗人民知道中华人民共和国在过去十六年半中所取得的伟大成就，阿富汗和中国之间的友好关系的加强有利于两国人民和世界和平。”他说，阿富汗和中国之间签订的友好和互不侵犯条约以及边界条约，在加强两国之间的关系方面起了巨大的作用。
    他说：“尽管我们两国的政治制度不同，但是由于我们两国的伟大领袖的远见和诚意，阿富汗和中国之间的友好关系一直在日益发展。”
    他表示完全相信阿富汗和中国之间的友谊不仅为两国人民带来丰硕的成果，而且将在保卫亚洲这一地区的和平方面发挥有效的作用。
    刘少奇主席在讲话（全文见第三版）中首先对喀布尔市民们的热烈欢迎表示衷心的感谢。
    刘主席说：“阿富汗人民热爱独立和自由。你们多次打败了帝国主义的武装进攻，从来没有在侵略者面前低过头。”他说，“阿富汗人民是勤劳智慧的人民。你们在历史上创造了光辉灿烂的文化。你们今天又在为改变自己国家的面貌而努力。在国王陛下的领导下，阿富汗在发展民族经济和民族文化方面取得了许多成就。”
    刘主席在谈到两国友好关系时指出，中国和阿富汗之间的传统友谊在两国建交以来又有了新的发展。他说：“十几年来，不管国际上出现什么大风大浪，我们两国人民的友谊总是发展的。这样经得起考验的友谊，是可贵的友谊。让我们两国人民共同努力，把这种友谊长久地发展下去！”
    刘主席指出，亚非国家都面临着发展民族经济、摆脱贫穷落后的艰巨任务。“我们亚非国家都有勤劳智慧的人民，都有丰富的资源。中国人民从自己的切身经验体会到，只要我们充分利用这些有利的条件，独立自主的民族经济是可以发展起来的，帝国主义长期掠夺所造成的贫穷落后状态是可以改变的。”
    刘主席说：“自力更生地进行建设，并不排除国际合作，而且首先需要在我们亚非国家之间互通有无，互相支援。”他说，“在我们的能力范围以内，向亚非国家提供经济援助，是我们应尽的义务。”他说，“我们提供援助的时候，严格尊重受援国的主权，绝不附带任何条件，绝不要求任何特权。我们反对利用援助进行控制和掠夺。我们提供援助的目的，是要帮助受援国逐步走上自力更生的道路。”他说，“把援助看成是单方面的恩赐，提供了援助就认为高人一等，这是一种恶劣的大国沙文主义态度，我们坚决反对。”
    刘主席最后说：“为了反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义，促进亚非国家的独立和进步事业，六亿五千万中国人民将永远同阿富汗人民站在一起，同其他亚非国家的人民站在一起，相互支持，共同奋斗。”
    刘主席的讲话一再被群众的热烈的掌声打断。
    接着，喀布尔市政府的代表向刘主席赠送了礼物。刘主席也给喀布尔市政府回赠了礼物。
    在表演了阿富汗最流行的民族舞蹈阿丹舞以后，举行了抢羊比赛，这个比赛是阿富汗人民通常在盛大的仪式和隆重的节日时举行的。
    在比赛前，抢羊的骑手骑着马排成一列，向主席台上的中国客人致敬。
    在比赛中，骑手们表现了很大的勇气和力量，博得了数万观众的欢迎。
    比赛结束后，刘主席给骑手们发了奖，并且赠送了礼物。
