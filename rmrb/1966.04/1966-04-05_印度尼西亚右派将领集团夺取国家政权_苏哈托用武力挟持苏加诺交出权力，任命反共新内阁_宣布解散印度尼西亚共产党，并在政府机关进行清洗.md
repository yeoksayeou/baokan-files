    Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, Jakarta Dispatch: The Indonesian right-wing military clique has recently taken a series of steps to complete its coup d'état plan to seize state power. After Army Commander Suharto ordered the arrest of fifteen Indonesian cabinet members on March 18th and announced the reorganization of the cabinet, the right-wing military clique coerced President Sukarno on March 27th to appoint a new anti-communist cabinet.
    According to reports from Antara News Agency and Jakarta Radio, Indonesian Army Commander Suharto, on the morning of March 18th, under the guise of President Sukarno, ordered the so-called "protective detention" of First Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Subandrio, Third Deputy Prime Minister Harul Saleh, and thirteen other ministers, including the ministers of Interior, Justice, and Information. According to United Press International, when Suharto took this action, he "sent paratroopers and tanks to Sukarno's Independence Palace," and "the cannons on the tanks were aimed at the Independence Palace." That afternoon, Suharto announced the formation of a cabinet presidium composed of Sultan Hamengkubuwono, Adam Malik, Ruslan Abdulgani, Idham Chalid, and Leimena, to replace the cabinet presidium composed of four deputy prime ministers, including Subandrio, appointed by President Sukarno after the cabinet reshuffle on February 21st. He also designated fourteen ministers to act as proxies for the ministers he had detained or dismissed.
    On March 27th, the right-wing military clique again coerced President Sukarno to announce a new cabinet list. According to Jakarta Radio, this cabinet consisted of a cabinet presidium composed of six deputy prime ministers, leading twenty-four ministries. Five of the six deputy prime ministers were those appointed by Suharto on March 18th, with Suharto himself now added. Among the twenty-four ministries, fourteen were headed by military personnel. At the same time, Nasution, who had been dismissed by Sukarno in the cabinet reshuffle on February 21st, was reappointed as the ministerial-level deputy commander of the "Crush Malaysia Command." Agence France-Presse reported that "the cabinet announced by Sukarno tonight (March 27th) shows that the army remains in the highest position. The Presidium is clearly controlled by anti-communists." Associated Press said, "Nasution, as deputy commander of the Crush Malaysia Command, will be able to wield considerable power in the government."
    Associated Press reported on March 20th, when Suharto arrested cabinet ministers and reorganized the cabinet, that "Sukarno has been forced to hand over all military and political power in the country to Suharto." The reason why Sukarno still retains the title of head of state is only because "the armed forces want to use him as a puppet leader."
    Jakarta Radio broadcast Suharto's "explanation on the composition of the new cabinet" on March 27th. Suharto said that the formation of the new cabinet was "one stage in a victorious stage of a series of struggles." He also said, "Our struggle is still long, but even so, the hope of victory has begun to be realized."
    On March 28th, according to Jakarta Radio, the Cakrabirawa Guard, originally responsible for guarding President Sukarno, was also announced to be replaced by an army military police battalion. Brigadier General Sabur, commander of the Cakrabirawa Guard, had already transferred power to Military Police Commander Sudirgo on March 28th. The Military Police Headquarters has appointed the military police paratrooper battalion led by Military Police Lieutenant Colonel Norman Shadony to be responsible for the president's security duties. According to United Press International on March 19th, the presidential guard was "disarmed" on the afternoon of March 18th.
    The Indonesian right-wing military clique's action to seize power this time began with Suharto sending army and paratrooper units to surround the presidential palace on March 11th, using force to coerce President Sukarno to surrender state power. Since President Sukarno announced a partial cabinet reshuffle on February 21st, right-wing students and thugs, supported by the Indonesian right-wing military clique, have continuously held demonstrations in Jakarta, surrounding the presidential palace, destroying some government departments, creating a chaotic and terrifying atmosphere. On March 10th, the Indonesian right-wing military clique mobilized paratrooper commando teams and elite troops from the Siliwangi Division to enter Jakarta during curfew and occupy positions. When President Sukarno convened a cabinet meeting on March 11th, he discovered that the presidential palace was surrounded and took a helicopter to Bogor. The Indonesian right-wing military clique immediately sent three generals to Bogor Palace on the afternoon of March 11th to present President Sukarno with an ultimatum demanding that he surrender power.
    According to reports from Jakarta Radio and Antara News Agency, Suharto began issuing orders in the name of President Sukarno on the evening of March 11th. In his first order, he announced that he was authorized to "take all measures deemed necessary to ensure security and calm," and to "ensure the personal safety" of the "president." Reuters reported that this order indicated that "Suharto has taken over all national power from President Sukarno."
    Suharto issued an order on March 12th, announcing the "dissolution" of the Indonesian Communist Party. According to Jakarta Radio, Suharto announced in this order: "The Indonesian Communist Party, including all its organizational parts from the central to local levels, as well as all organizations with the same purpose and under its jurisdiction and protection, is dissolved; the Indonesian Communist Party is declared a prohibited organization in the entire territory of the Republic of Indonesia; this decision shall take effect immediately."
    According to Jakarta Radio, Suharto issued another order on March 14th, ordering the "entire leadership, cadres, and activists" of the Indonesian Communist Party and related mass organizations to "surrender" by the end of March. Suharto said, "If they do not surrender by the specified date, the relevant responsible authorities will take resolute measures." Suharto also "demanded that the leaders of all political parties and mass organizations, while waiting for the government to make further decisions, not accept or accommodate members of the Indonesian Communist Party and mass organizations under its jurisdiction, protection, and with the same purpose as it. Resolute measures will be taken against organizations that violate this regulation."
    On March 31st, Suharto issued another order, "instructing state organs and government departments and units at all central and local levels" to "purge former members of the Indonesian Communist Party and mass organizations under its jurisdiction and protection."

    印度尼西亚右派将领集团夺取国家政权
    苏哈托用武力挟持苏加诺交出权力，任命反共新内阁
    宣布解散印度尼西亚共产党，并在政府机关进行清洗
    新华社四日讯　雅加达消息：印度尼西亚右派将领集团最近采取一系列步骤，完成了它们的夺取国家政权的政变计划。在陆军司令苏哈托三月十八日下令逮捕十五名印度尼西亚内阁成员、并且宣布改组内阁之后，右派将领集团在三月二十七日又挟持苏加诺总统任命了一个新的反共内阁。
    据安塔拉通讯社和雅加达电台报道，印度尼西亚陆军司令苏哈托三月十八日上午假借苏加诺总统的名义，下令对第一副总理兼外交部长苏班德里约、第三副总理哈鲁尔·萨勒和其他包括内政、司法、宣传部长在内的十三名部长实行所谓“保护性拘留”。据合众国际社报道，苏哈托在采取这个行动的时候，曾经“派伞兵和坦克开往苏加诺的独立宫”，“坦克上的大炮瞄准着独立宫”。当天下午，苏哈托宣布由苏丹·哈孟库·布沃诺、阿达姆·马利克、鲁斯兰·阿卜杜加尼、伊达姆·哈利德和莱梅纳等五人组成内阁主席团，以代替苏加诺总统在二月二十一日改组内阁后任命的由苏班德里约等四名副总理组成的内阁主席团，还指定十四位部长来代理被他拘捕或撤职的部长们的职务。
    三月二十七日，右派将领集团又挟持苏加诺总统宣布了一个新的内阁名单。据雅加达电台广播，这个内阁由六名副总理组成内阁主席团，分别领导二十四个部。六名副总理中的五名副总理是苏哈托在三月十八日任命的，这次又加上了苏哈托本人。在二十四个部中，就有十四个部的部长是军人。同时，在二月二十一日内阁改组中被苏加诺撤职的纳苏蒂安，也被重新任命为“粉碎马来西亚指挥部”部长级副总指挥。法新社的报道说，“苏加诺今晚（三月二十七日）宣布的内阁表明，陆军仍然处于最高地位。主席团显然是由反共分子控制的。”美联社说，“纳苏蒂安作为粉碎马来西亚指挥部副总指挥能够在政府中掌握相当大的权力”。
    美联社在三月二十日报道苏哈托逮捕内阁部长和改组内阁时说：“苏加诺已被迫把这个国家的一切军政权力交给苏哈托。”苏加诺之所以还被保留元首的名义，只是因为“武装部队想利用他作为傀儡领袖”。
    雅加达电台三月二十七日广播了苏哈托“关于新内阁组成的说明”。苏哈托说，这次成立新内阁是“一系列斗争的胜利阶段中的一个阶段”。他还说，“我们的斗争还很长久，虽然如此，胜利的希望已经开始实现了。”
    三月二十八日，据雅加达电台广播，原来负责警卫苏加诺总统的查克拉比拉瓦警卫团也已被宣布撤换，由陆军宪兵营代替。查克拉比拉瓦警卫团团长沙布尔准将已经在三月二十八日把权力移交给宪兵司令苏迪戈。宪兵司令部已经委任宪兵中校诺曼·沙多尼领导的宪兵伞兵营负责总统的警卫任务。据合众国际社三月十九日报道：总统府警卫团在三月十八日下午即“被解除了武装”。
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团这次夺取政权的行动，是从苏哈托三月十一日派遣陆军和伞兵部队包围总统府，以武力要挟苏加诺总统交出国家权力开始的。自从苏加诺总统二月二十一日宣布内阁部分改组后，受印度尼西亚右派将领集团支持的右派学生和暴徒在雅加达不断举行示威，包围总统府，捣毁一些政府部门，造成一片混乱与恐怖气氛。三月十日，印度尼西亚右派将领集团调集伞兵突击队和西利万吉师的精锐部队趁着宵禁时开进雅加达并占据阵地。当苏加诺总统在三月十一日召开内阁会议的时候，发现总统府被包围后即乘直升飞机前往茂物。印度尼西亚右派将领集团立即派出三名将领在三月十一日下午去茂物宫，向苏加诺总统提出要他交出权力的最后通牒。
    根据雅加达电台和安塔拉通讯社的报道，苏哈托是在三月十一日晚间开始以苏加诺总统的名义发号施令的。他在第一个命令中宣布，他受权“采取被认为必要的一切措施来保证治安、平静局面”，并“保证总统”的“个人安全”。路透社的报道说，这项命令表明“苏哈托已经从苏加诺总统手中接管了全部国家权力”。
    苏哈托在三月十二日发布一项命令，宣布“解散”印度尼西亚共产党。据雅加达电台报道，苏哈托在这项命令中宣布：“解散印度尼西亚共产党，包括其所有自中央至地方各级的各部分组织以及所有同它同一宗旨和在它统属、庇护下的组织；宣布印度尼西亚共产党是在印度尼西亚共和国全部境内受禁止的组织；这项决定即日生效”。
    据雅加达电台广播，苏哈托在三月十四日又发布一项命令，限令要印度尼西亚共产党及有关的群众团体的“全体领导成员、干部和积极分子”在三月底以前“自首”。苏哈托说，“如果在限定的日期没有自首，有关的负责当局将采取坚决的措施。”苏哈托同时还“要求所有的政党和群众团体的领导在等待政府做出进一步决定的同时，不接受和收容印度尼西亚共产党及在它统属、庇护下的以及同它同一宗旨的群众团体的成员。凡违反这个规定的组织，将对他们采取坚决的措施。”
    三月三十一日，苏哈托又发布一项命令，“指示中央和地方各级国家机关和政府各部门、各单位”，“把前印度尼西亚共产党及在它统属、庇护下的群众团体的成员清洗出去”。
