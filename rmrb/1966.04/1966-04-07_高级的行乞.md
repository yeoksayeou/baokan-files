    Advanced Begging
    After returning from her visit to the United States, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi repeatedly stated that she did not go to the United States to beg for "aid." The Indian press trust also repeatedly promoted this point.
    However, there is a very interesting passage in the Indian propaganda machine's support for the Indian Prime Minister. It wrote: Mrs. Gandhi’s "assessment of the Chinese threat to Asia and her explanation of India's efforts to help contain it, apparently deeply impressed President Johnson, who immediately announced that his country was ready to assist India's economic development through international efforts." This completely revealed the truth. It turns out that the Indian Prime Minister was seeking rewards by offering anti-China strategies to Johnson. This is indeed not ordinary begging.

### 高级的行乞

    高级的行乞
    印度总理英迪拉·甘地访美回国后一再表白，她去美国并不是为了乞求“援助”。印度报业托辣斯也反复宣传这一点。
    但是，这个印度的宣传机器有一段为印度总理捧场的话，却很有意思。它写道：甘地夫人“对于中国对亚洲的威胁所作的估计以及就印度致力协助遏制它所作的说明，看来给了约翰逊总统深刻的印象，约翰逊总统当即宣布他的国家准备通过国际上的努力协助印度的经济发展”。这就完全露了底，原来印度总理是靠向约翰逊献反华之策来邀赏。这的确不是一般的行乞。
