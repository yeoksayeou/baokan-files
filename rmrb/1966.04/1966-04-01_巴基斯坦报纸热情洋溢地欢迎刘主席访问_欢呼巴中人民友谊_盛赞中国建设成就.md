    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, March 31st. Pakistani newspapers have been reporting Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Pakistan with great length and enthusiasm in recent days, hailing the profound and militant friendship between the Chinese and Pakistani peoples. The "Morning News," with a 26-year history, published an eight-column headline in Chinese for the first time on the 30th: "Welcome Distinguished Guests to Visit Karachi."
    The Urdu newspapers "Jang," "Anjam," and "Hurriyat" all prominently featured photos of Chairman Mao Zedong and Chairman Liu Shaoqi on their front pages that day. Some newspapers published special color pages with large Chinese characters: "Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!" Many newspapers devoted entire pages to reporting the grand welcome that the people of Lahore gave to Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
    A report from Lahore published in one newspaper vividly described the local people's welcome of the Chinese leader as follows: "The grand welcome extended by so many people in Lahore when the Chairman of the People's Republic of China and his entourage arrived was unprecedented since independence."
    "Almost the entire population of this provincial capital came out to welcome the leader of a great nation that supported it during the most trying moments in Pakistan's history. Some estimate that over a million people came out to welcome the Chinese leader."
    "The five-mile route from Lahore Airport to the Governor's House was packed with hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children, all eager to catch a glimpse of the distinguished guests."
    "They climbed trees and telephone poles, sat on top of trucks and buses, waving to Chairman Liu and other Chinese dignitaries, and shouting: 'Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship!'"
    "The city's life presented a new atmosphere... Along this five-mile stretch, huge banners bore welcome slogans in Urdu and Chinese: 'Long Live Sino-Pakistani Friendship,' 'Long Live Afro-Asian Solidarity,' 'Long Live Chairman Liu Shaoqi,' and so on."
    "When the plane taxied and stopped on the runway, the enthusiastic applause of the welcoming crowd resounded through the sky."
    "Chairman Liu shook hands with the people waiting there to welcome him, and people presented Chairman Liu with many garlands. At this time, the enthusiastic crowds continued to shout slogans, and the military and police brass band played welcome music."
    "As Chairman Liu approached the crowd, flower petals rained down on him."
    "Chairman Liu then proceeded to the Governor's House in a grand motorcade escort."
    "Thousands of schoolchildren, dressed in their festive finery, welcomed the distinguished guests at several designated locations along the way. They shouted: 'Long Live Uncle Liu,' 'China-Pakistan Friendship.'"
    "As the distinguished guests passed by, they scattered flower petals, sang songs, and performed wonderful folk dances accompanied by their school bands."
    "Behind the motorcade of officials were more than five thousand taxis and rickshaws, followed by another five thousand small motorcycles."
    "The street, one hundred and fifty feet wide, was packed with people who had come from afar."
    "An eighty-year-old man, holding the national flags of Pakistan and China, kept waving them, saying: 'Lahore has seen two proud events: winning the Battle of Lahore and this grand reception.'"
    "Dawn," "Morning News," and many other newspapers published special visit supplements and carried special features and articles introducing China's economic and cultural achievements, praising China's construction achievements and Sino-Pakistani friendship.
    The Urdu newspaper "Today's News" published an editorial on the 28th, praising Sino-Pakistani friendship as being based on mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs. The editorial said that these fundamental principles of Sino-Pakistani friendship have formed an unbreakable bond between the two countries.

    巴基斯坦报纸热情洋溢地欢迎刘主席访问
    欢呼巴中人民友谊　盛赞中国建设成就
    新华社拉瓦尔品第三十一日电　巴基斯坦报纸连日来以巨大篇幅热情洋溢地报道刘少奇主席在巴基斯坦进行访问，并欢呼中巴两国人民的深厚的战斗友谊。具有二十六年历史的《晨报》三十日第一次用中文刊登了一条八栏的大标题：《欢迎贵宾访问卡拉奇》。
    乌尔都文《战斗报》、《成就报》和《自由报》在这天的头版上都以显著地位登载了毛泽东主席和刘少奇主席的照片。一些报纸出套色专页，上面印着中文大字：“巴中友谊万岁！”许多报纸以整版篇幅报道了拉合尔人民热烈欢迎刘少奇主席的盛况。
    一家报纸刊登的发自拉合尔的报道对当地人民欢迎中国领导人作了如下生动的描述：“在中华人民共和国主席及其随行人员到达的时候，拉合尔那么多的人民出来表示盛大欢迎，这是独立以来从来没有过的事情。”
    “这个省会的全体居民几乎全都出来欢迎在巴基斯坦受到最大的考验的时刻支持它的一个伟大国家的领导人。还有人估计，出来欢迎中国领导人的达一百万人以上。”
    “从拉合尔机场到省督府的五英里长的路上挤满了几十万男男女女和儿童，他们都想看一看贵宾。”
    “他们爬在树上、电线杆上，坐在卡车和公共汽车顶上向刘主席和其他中国贵宾挥手致意，并且高呼：‘巴中友谊万岁！’。”
    “这个城市的生活呈现出一派新的气象，……在这长达五英里的路上，巨大的横幅上用乌尔都文和中文写着欢迎标语：‘巴中友好万岁’，‘亚非团结万岁’，‘刘少奇主席万岁’等等。”
    “当飞机在跑道上滑行和停下来的时候，热情的群众发出的热烈的掌声，响彻云霄。”
    “刘主席同等候在那里欢迎他的人们握手，人们给刘主席戴上很多的花环。这时，热情的群众继续呼口号，军警铜乐队奏起欢迎曲。”
    “当刘主席走近人群时，花瓣象雨一般撒在他身上。”
    “刘主席然后在浩浩荡荡的摩托车队护送下前往省督府。”
    “几千个学校儿童穿着他们节日的漂亮衣服在沿途好些个特为他们划出来的场地上欢迎贵宾。他们高喊：‘刘伯伯万岁’，‘中巴友好’。”
    “在贵宾经过的时候，他们撒着花瓣，唱起歌，在他们学校乐队的伴奏下表演了精彩的民间舞。”
    “在官员们的汽车队后面是五千多辆出租汽车和人力车，再后面还有五千辆小摩托车。”
    “宽达一百五十英尺的街道被远道而来的人们挤得水泄不通。”
    “一个八十岁的老人拿着巴中两国国旗不住地摇，他说：‘拉合尔看到了两件引以为荣的事情：打赢了拉合尔战役，然后是这次盛大的接待。’”
    《黎明报》、《晨报》以及其他许多报纸出访问特刊，并刊登了介绍中国经济和文化成就的特稿和文章，赞扬中国的建设成就和中巴友谊。
    乌尔都文的《今天报》二十八日发表社论，赞扬中巴友谊是建立在互相尊重、和平共处和互不干涉内政的基础上的。社论说，巴中友谊的这些根本原则在两国之间形成了牢不可破的纽带。
