    Xinhua News Agency, 6th dispatch, Melbourne: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, *Vanguard*, published an article in the ninth issue of its third volume in March, exposing that the new Soviet leaders are more vigorously pursuing a revisionist-capitulationist line than Khrushchev and are forming various alliances with reactionaries such as the United States to attack revolutionary movements.

    The article, entitled "Two Years Since the Founding of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)," stated that the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) was founded two years ago. "The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) has ideologically, politically, and organizationally broken with revisionism. The revisionists abandoned communism and split from communism."

    The article said, "At every crucial turning point in history, revisionism always appears.

    "Today, capitalism and imperialism are encountering more critical situations than at any time in history.

    "The worldwide people's movement is flourishing. Everything is in turmoil. Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is desperately trying to stabilize the situation. The more desperately they try to struggle, the more turbulent the situation becomes, and the stronger the challenge to their system becomes.

    "Revisionism appears in this turbulent situation. Its role is to help 'stabilize' the situation: to maintain the status quo.

    "The Soviet revisionists, headed by Khrushchev, emerged. They tried their best to maintain the status quo, forbidding revolution and the people's struggle.

    "Khrushchev split from the international communist movement. His successors, Khrushchevites without Khrushchev, are continuing to pursue the Khrushchev line even more vigorously than Khrushchev.

    "They are more vigorous because, since Khrushchev's downfall, imperialism's situation has become even more dire.

    "They are forming various alliances with reactionaries—the reactionaries of the United States, Japan, and India—to attack revolutionary movements."

    The article also stated, "Within Australia, the revisionist group follows the Khrushchevites" and "this group is increasingly and blatantly attempting to make the Australian working class adapt to capitalism."

    The article said that the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) "has always held high the banner of Australian national independence, the banner of fighting for democratic rights, improving living standards, and striving for the realization of the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the past two years, it has greatly strengthened the struggle to maintain the purity of Marxist-Leninist thought. It demands the serious study of the classic works of Marxism-Leninism—the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Mao Zedong. Only those classic works explain that the unity of theory and practice is the essence of revolutionary struggle."

    The article concluded, "The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) rejects revisionist traitors at home and abroad. It will undoubtedly work harder and harder to unite more than ninety percent of the people to fight against U.S. imperialism."

    苏联领导加紧勾结美国和反动派进攻革命运动
    澳共（马列主义者）弃绝国内外的修正主义叛徒
    新华社六日讯　墨尔本消息：　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）机关报《先锋报》在三月份出版的第三卷第九期刊载一篇文章，揭露苏联新领导比赫鲁晓夫更加卖力地推行修正主义—投降主义路线，同美国等国反动派结成各种各样的联盟来进攻革命运动。
    这篇以《澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）成立两周年》为题的文章说，两年以前，澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）成立了。“澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）在意识形态上、在政治上和组织上都同修正主义决裂了。修正主义者抛弃了共产主义，从共产主义分裂出去了。”
    文章说，“在历史上每一个紧要的转变关头，总是有修正主义出现。
    “今天，资本主义和帝国主义遇到了比历史上任何时候都更加危急的情况。
    “全世界人民运动蓬勃发展起来。一切都在动荡之中。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，拼命企图使局面稳定下来。他们越是拼命企图挣扎，局面就动荡得更厉害，对他们的制度的挑战也就越强烈。
    “修正主义就是在这种动荡的局面下出现的。它的作用是要帮助‘稳定’局面：维持住现状。
    “以赫鲁晓夫为首的苏联修正主义者出现了。他们竭力企图维持现状，不准革命，不准人民斗争。
    “赫鲁晓夫从国际共产主义运动中分裂出去了。他的继承人，没有赫鲁晓夫的赫鲁晓夫主义者，甚至比赫鲁晓夫更加卖力地在继续推行赫鲁晓夫路线。
    “他们所以更加卖力，是因为自从赫鲁晓夫垮台以来，帝国主义的处境是更加困难得要命了。
    “他们同反动派——美国、日本和印度的反动派——结成各种各样的联盟来进攻革命运动。”
    文章还说，“在澳大利亚国内，修正主义集团追随赫鲁晓夫主义者”而且“这个集团越来越露骨和毫不掩饰地企图使澳大利亚的工人阶级去适应资本主义”。
    文章说，澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）“一直高举澳大利亚民族独立的旗帜，高举争取民主权利、提高生活水平和为争取实现无产阶级专政而斗争的旗帜。最近两年来，它大大加强了维护马克思列宁主义思想的纯洁性的斗争。它要求认真学习马克思列宁主义的经典著作——马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林和毛泽东的著作。只有那些经典著作才说明，理论和实践一致是革命斗争的精髓所在。”
    文章最后说，“澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义者）弃绝国内外的修正主义叛徒。它无疑要越来越努力地工作，团结百分之九十以上的人民来同美帝国主义作斗争。”
