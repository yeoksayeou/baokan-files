    After the branch factory was established, Xiao Wang, a milling machine operator in the milling group, received a brand-new universal dividing head. The more he looked at it, the more he liked it. When he glanced at the old, dark dividing head next to the machine tool, he couldn't help but remember the two jobs he had ruined because it wasn't accurate. So, he found a handcart, put the old dividing head on it, and pushed it outside, muttering to himself, "Now it's time for you to go to the museum!"

    That day, Xiao Wang cleaned the new dividing head and clamped it onto the milling machine to start working. Hey! It was really great! Xiao Wang was so happy that he couldn't close his mouth. The more he worked, the more energetic he became. He was secretly rejoicing when he saw Group Leader Old Qin coming from the factory gate. As soon as he entered the workshop, he said, "Xiao Wang, I just saw that the gear factory doesn't have a regular indexing shaft. Quickly unload our new dividing head and send it over!"

    "What?" Xiao Wang was taken aback and couldn't help but say, "Master Qin, this is our only precision tool. If we give it to them, we..."

    "Young man, our factory has been split up, but our thinking can't be!" Master Qin said firmly and frankly, "Send it over quickly!"

    "Then what about our work?..."

    "Think of a way!"

    Xiao Wang had no choice but to unload the universal dividing head. He caressed it with cotton yarn for a long time before carrying it to the cart, grabbed the handle, and sent it to the gear factory.

    Xiao Wang pushed the new dividing head to the gear factory. When the dispatcher, Old Yu, saw it, he exclaimed, "Oh, you've brought us another new one!" He refused to accept it, grabbed the cart handle, turned it around, and started to push it back. After taking a few steps, he ran into Old Qin, who said with a smile, "First Branch Factory, you've given us all the good things. This time, no matter what, we can't accept it."

    Old Qin snatched the cart with his strong hands, chuckled twice, and said, "Your new factory is starting from scratch, we have a foundation." After saying hello to Xiao Wang, he pushed it inside.

    The next day, as soon as they started work, Master Qin pushed the old dividing head that Xiao Wang had thrown away back into the workshop and said to Xiao Wang, "Let's continue working today!" Xiao Wang said unhappily, "Last time, I ruined several jobs because of using it."

    "Try doing one!" Master Qin said seriously.

    Xiao Wang thought: I'll try with a piece of scrap first, and if it doesn't meet the accuracy requirements, I'll talk about it later. So he used the old dividing head to make one, and when he measured it, it was just right. He tried another one, and it was still right. Just then, the inspector came over, measured Xiao Wang's work, and it was also合格 (qualified). Xiao Wang was a little puzzled, "What's going on?"

    Master Qin said, "That day, when I saw you throw away the old dividing head, I felt extremely uncomfortable! You don't know, when the reactionaries fled, they did everything possible to destroy things. That's why I buried it. Usually, it's my fault that I didn't tell you..."

    The inspector said that Master Qin took the old dividing head back to the tool room that day. To update it, he disassembled all the parts, recorded the data of any unqualified parts, and after work, he ran to several tool factories in Beijing to contact them about what parts to use. Everyone supported him enthusiastically. Master Qin thought about replacing its "insides" to make it capable of doing precision work.

    At this time, Xiao Wang's heart was in turmoil: So these days, Master Qin has been running around for this after work! Why did Master Qin think of this, but I didn't? I always talk about building the country through diligence and thrift, but why can't I put it into practice when the time comes? The more he thought about it, the more his face burned, all the way to his neck. He said excitedly, "Master Qin, what I threw away wasn't the old dividing head, but our proletarian thinking..."

    Master Qin also said with emotion, "It doesn't matter, get up again after falling, just like a child walking, fall a few more times and you'll walk more firmly!"

    分厂以后	北京锥形齿轮厂工人　张　虎
    分厂以前，铣工组小旺领了个崭新的万能分度头，小旺越瞧越喜爱。当他把眼光落在机床边那个黑不溜秋的旧分度头时，不禁想起前些时用它，因为不准确而废两个活的事。于是，他找来个手推车，把旧分度头放在车上往外推，自言自语道：“这下你也该进博物馆了！”
    这天，小旺把新的分度头擦洗干净，卡在铣床上干起活来，嘿！真叫棒！小旺乐得嘴都合不上了，真是越干越来劲。他正暗自欢喜，只见组长老秦师傅从厂门口走来，一进车间便说：“小旺，我刚才见齿轮厂没规矩分度正转轴呢，快把咱这新分度头卸下来送去！”
    “什么？”小旺大吃一惊，不由得说：“秦师傅，咱可就是这个精密的东西了，一给人家，咱……”
    “小伙子，咱厂子分家了，思想可不能分家呀！”秦师傅坚定而坦率地说：“快送去！”
    “那咱干活？……”
    “想办法嘛！”
    小旺无可奈何，只好把万能分度头卸下来，用棉纱爱不释手地摸了半天才搬到车上，抄起车把往齿轮厂送去。
    小旺推着新分度头到了齿轮厂，调度员老于一看，嗬，又把新的给我们送来了！说什么也不收，他夺过车把，掉头往回推，刚走几步，就碰上老秦，便笑着说：“一分厂，你们把好东西都给我们了，这回呀，说什么我们也不能要。”
    老秦用那双粗壮的手夺过车子，嘿嘿乐了两声说：“你们新厂是白手起家，我们有老底儿。”说完和小旺打了个招呼就往里推。
    第二天一上班，老秦师傅从车间外又把小旺扔的那个旧分度头推了进来，向小旺说：“今天接着干吧！”小旺不怎么高兴地说：“上回就因为使它把几个活给干废了。”
    “你干一个试试嘛！”秦师傅认真地说。
    小旺想：我先找块废料试试，到时达不到精度要求再说。于是他就用旧分度头干了一个，他一量正合适，就又试了一个，仍然合适。正好这时检验员走来，一量小旺的活，也合格。小旺有点莫名其妙了，“这是怎么回事？”
    秦师傅说：“那天我看你把旧分度头扔了，心里别提多难受哇！你不知道，反动派逃跑时尽情破坏，这是我把它埋起来的。平时也怪我没有给你们讲讲……。”
    检验员说，那天秦师傅把旧分度头弄回工具库去，为了让它更新，把零件全拆了，那件不合格都作下了数据，下了班跑了北京好几家工具厂联系好用什么部件，人家都热情支持，秦师傅琢磨着换了它的“内脏”，才使它能干精密活了。
    这时小旺心里翻腾开了：敢情这几天秦师傅下了班就是为这事奔波呢！为什么秦师傅想到的我却没想到呢？平时老说勤俭建国，为什么到时候就挨不上弦儿呢？想着想着，不觉脸上发烧，直到脖根。他激动地说：“秦师傅，我扔的不是旧分度头，是把咱无产阶级的思想给扔掉了……”
    秦师傅也很感慨地说：“不要紧，摔了跤再起来，象小孩走路一样，多摔几个跟头走得更结实啊！”
