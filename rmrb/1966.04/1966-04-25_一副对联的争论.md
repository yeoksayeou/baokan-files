    A Debate Over a Couplet
    Editor's Note: This is a vivid example of grasping living thought and is very enlightening for the debate we are currently conducting on political and professional relationships.

    Politics and professional work, who commands whom? Many comrades speak clearly about this issue, but often become confused when encountering specific problems. If we only conduct "classroom-style" debates, with you having your set of arguments and me having mine, without touching on the actualities of thought, it will be difficult to raise our understanding. The approach of the Chengguan Machine Repair Cooperative in Pingyang County is a way of grasping living thought. Grasping some specific examples, drawing out living thought, and discussing from specific cases to the abstract. Because it touches the actualities of thought more deeply, the resolution of cognitive problems is also more thorough.

    The approach of the Chengguan Machine Repair Cooperative in Pingyang County also has another characteristic: they do not rush to conclusions on issues of controversy, nor do they impose their conclusions on others, but rather discuss and do at the same time, allowing the facts to determine right and wrong. This approach is very good. Understanding comes from practice. Some problems may have different viewpoints, some may agree, some may disagree, but we can first try it out, and improve our understanding from the process of doing, which is more persuasive.

    At the entrance of the workshop of the Chengguan Machine Repair Cooperative in Pingyang County, Zhejiang Province, a couplet is posted, which reads:
              Putting politics in command yields twice the result with half the effort
              Only grasping professional work yields half the result with twice the effort
    To those unaware of the details, this seems like an ordinary couplet. Who knew that whether or not to post this couplet had sparked a fierce debate.

    The story is as follows:
              Heartache
    The cooperative arranged a club to enliven the political and cultural life of its members. Someone suggested posting a couplet at the entrance of the club. Cheng Gongshi, the Party branch secretary, thought: The club is a position for ideological education and should have a suitable couplet. He flipped through Chairman Mao's books, compared it with the problems existing in the cooperative, and then found two striking titles in the newspaper: "Putting politics in command yields twice the result with half the effort, only grasping professional work yields half the result with twice the effort." He thought it was very suitable. He immediately had the accountant write it and posted it at the entrance of the club.

    As soon as the bright red new couplet was posted, many people gathered to look at it. Lin Shumei, the cadre in charge of professional work, could not calm down when he saw "Only grasping professional work yields half the result with twice the effort." He thought: I'm running around all year round, working hard to contact businesses for the cooperative, is the credit only half? He believed that the machine repair cooperative could not survive without business, and the members could not live without business. Of course, only by grasping business firmly can the enterprise prosper. As for politics, this is a matter of talking, not doing - unimportant. But strangely, what does Lao Cheng mean by posting this couplet now? At the time, he couldn't figure it out in his mind, so he went to Cheng Gongshi.

    "Lao Cheng, don't you know the actual situation of the cooperative?"

    How could Cheng Gongshi not know the actual situation of the cooperative! At that time, the machine repair cooperative's business was sluggish, production tasks were insufficient, the members' thoughts were chaotic, and many people, in order to do more work hours and earn more wages, only cared about quantity and not quality, etc. Lin Shumei and Cheng Gongshi both knew these actual problems. However, they each had their own views on how to deal with these problems. Lin Shumei believed that if there were problems in business, it was necessary to firmly grasp business. If the business problem was solved, there would be no need to worry about mobilizing the enthusiasm of the workers; Cheng Gongshi believed that the human factor was the most important. As long as everyone's awareness was raised and their thoughts were unified, there would be no need to worry about production.

    At that time, Lao Cheng smiled and said, "Of course I know the actual situation of the cooperative."

    "Then why did you post this couplet?"

    "Why did you post this couplet?" Lao Cheng painfully began to talk about the lessons from the past.

    That was in the previous period, when the cooperative's production tasks were very busy, and several leading cadres were busy with business. At that time, it was believed that handicraft cooperatives were different from factories, and there was the "magic weapon" of piece-rate wages, so there was no need to worry about mobilizing the enthusiasm of the members. Therefore, political and ideological work was relaxed. In order to earn more money, the members worked quickly, disregarding quality, resulting in a large backlog of products. They had to cut prices, cut prices, and cut prices again! But they still couldn't sell them. At one point, it caused production with no funds and products with no sales channels.

    Speaking of this, Lao Cheng said painfully: "Think about it, what will be the consequences if politics is not put in command and only business is grasped? How much credit do we cadres have?"

    Mentioning the past, Lin Shumei also felt very sad. He also admitted that these problems existed in the cooperative now. However, can these "actual" problems be solved by putting politics in command? He still shook his head, expressing his doubt.
                    Patience
    The dissent to this couplet was not limited to cadres? It also aroused enthusiastic response among the members:

    "Politics cannot be seen or touched, production is a hard task. Sitting down to study politics every day, see if you have food to eat."

    "Talking about politics won't open up sales channels, grasping business can open up sales channels, there is work to do, there is money to earn."

    "The couplet puts politics too high, I think politics and business should be equal."

    These words slowly reached Cheng Gongshi's ears.

    He really did not expect that posting a couplet would cause such a big storm. People often say that some seemingly ordinary small things often contain thought-provoking great truths. This couplet illustrates this point. Thinking this way, his mind suddenly opened up: Whether or not to post this couplet in thought is by no means a small matter, but a major event related to the prosperity of socialism and the elimination of capitalism for everyone and the entire enterprise. To truly post this couplet in the minds of every cadre and member is not an easy task and will inevitably experience a fierce ideological struggle.

    Soon, the couplet posted at the entrance of the club suddenly disappeared. Some said it was blown away by the wind, others said it was swept away during the clean-up. No matter what, the couplet would not run away on its own.

    At this time, someone in the Party branch suggested investigating the "responsibility" to find out who tore the couplet. Branch Secretary Cheng Gongshi said thoughtfully: "The responsibility lies with me."

    Everyone was stunned when they heard this.

    "That's right." Lao Cheng continued: "This cannot be blamed on the backward thinking of the members, but only on my failure to do a good job in ideological work; this cannot be blamed on the members not asking about politics, but only on the Party branch's failure to highlight politics." He believed that as the branch secretary, facing these facts, the responsibility could only be investigated from himself.

    At this critical moment, he remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: In many cases, although the masses objectively have the need for certain reforms, they do not yet have this awareness subjectively… We must wait patiently. Chairman Mao's words were like a guiding light, illuminating his thinking: Without the consciousness and willingness of the masses, it would become a mere formality and fail. Yes! Wait patiently. Just then, the Pingyang Chengguan Town Party Committee issued a notice to all units in the town about typical experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works. This greatly inspired Lao Cheng and opened his mind: To do a good job in production and run a socialist enterprise well, it is necessary to highlight politics; and to highlight politics, it is necessary to seriously study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao's books are worth a thousand pieces of gold, and Chairman Mao's words are worth ten thousand sentences. The cooperative immediately organized cadres and members to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and also formulated a study system.

    Coincidentally, at that time, the cooperative received a batch of oil pool and mud mixer processing business. The processing quantity was large, and the time required was tight. Hong A'nai, the person in charge of the workshop, and Lin Shumei, the business cadre, calculated that it would only be possible to complete it by working overtime every day. Therefore, they went to Lao Cheng to discuss and requested that the two nights of political study every week be stopped for production, otherwise the production task would not be completed. Lao Cheng pondered for a while and said: "In order to ensure the quality and quantity of this batch of tasks, not only can the two nights of political study every week not be stopped, but they must also be strengthened." Lao Cheng felt that this was a difficult production task, and if the positive factors of people were not mobilized, it would not be possible to complete it even if they worked overtime every night.
                      Confidence
    The task was urgent, and there was no mood to sit down and study. Lin Shumei and Hong A'nai, who were sitting on the side, were extremely anxious.

    At this time, Cheng Gongshi asked everyone to study "Serve the People." He took the lead in connecting with his own thoughts and getting in touch with reality, guiding members to talk about their understanding by comparing with problems.

    Most of the members of the machine repair cooperative came from poor families, and they loved to listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. As soon as they read Chairman Mao's books, the revolutionary enthusiasm came. Member Lin Fuxi used to always have conflicts when working, thinking that there was no play in the cooperative for him to "sing." After studying "Serve the People," he said: "Zhang Side burned charcoal for the revolution, isn't my ironmaking also for the revolution! Thinking this way, I also have strength in my hand when I lift the iron hammer."

      "That's right." Member Li Shoutian continued: "I used to be careless when working, and I also had an incorrect guiding ideology, thinking that working to earn money was for myself, and others didn't care, I didn't expect that our production was also serving the people. Thinking about the past, I'm really sorry to the people."

    In addition to organizing everyone to study two nights a week, Cheng Gongshi usually used lunch breaks and rest time before and after work to talk to everyone about their study experiences. The study was from shallow to deep, step by step. Everyone expressed that they would use practical actions to do a good job in production and serve the people. Then, a production competition was launched in the whole cooperative, the production progress was unprecedentedly accelerated, and the quality was continuously improved. This batch of difficult tasks was completed two days ahead of schedule with guaranteed quality and quantity.

    The facts are the most persuasive. The completion of this task was so outstanding that it really exceeded everyone's expectations. Lin Shumei was even more surprised: the factory buildings, machines, and equipment were all the same as before; the people were also the same people as before, and all objective conditions were the same. So why was there such a big change? So he eagerly went to flip through the article "Where Do Correct Ideas Come From?" reading it over and over again. The principle of spirit transforming into matter, said by Chairman Mao, made him feel very cordial, and also exposed the problem of "seeing things but not people" in his thoughts in one word. Looking at Chairman Mao's books and thinking about the facts in front of him, doesn't it prove that the principle of "putting politics in command yields twice the result with half the effort" is absolutely true?

    Thinking of this, he hurriedly ran to Cheng Gongshi, requesting that the couplet be posted again. Lao Cheng said: "Whether or not to post this couplet again, let everyone discuss it!"
                      Determination
    At that time, the "atmosphere" in the cooperative also changed. Members often discussed their experiences in studying Chairman Mao's works together. Writing experiences, taking notes. Even Xue Tongdi, an old member in his fifties, and Shi Delao, a stoker master, also studied before work and read after work, and asked their children to read to him when they went home to rest. The spiritual outlook of the workers changed, the view of serving the people was established, and the cooperative's business developed. The output value increased by one time compared with the past, and the work efficiency also increased by half.

    For these changes, the members saw it in their eyes and were happy in their hearts. Slowly, the couplet of "Putting politics in command yields twice the result with half the effort, only grasping professional work yields half the result with twice the effort" was posted in their hearts.

    At a staff meeting, worker Chen Jilv suggested reposting this couplet. Everyone almost unanimously agreed and decided to post it at the entrance of the workshop. Their reason was: the workshop is the front line of production. Posting this couplet will give them a mirror to correctly handle the relationship between politics and production, and they can move forward in big strides.

    How much role does this couplet play? This cannot be expressed in numbers. Not long after the new couplet was posted, the Pingyang Chemical Plant urgently needed a set of ferrous sulfate towers. The task of iron castings was more than 20,000 catties, of which the largest casting required one ton of molten iron. Could such a task be undertaken? The cooperative had neither cast such things nor thought about it. In the past, Lin Shumei would have declined such business long ago. Now, the first thing he thought of was that this was an important equipment for producing chemical fertilizers and was a major event related to supporting agriculture, so it could not be pushed away. Therefore, he went to the workshop to discuss with everyone. When the members heard this, they all said that they must undertake it and overcome any difficulties, no matter how great.

    Producing such a big guy, for this small handicraft cooperative, the difficulties were item by item, one by one, and could not be explained clearly. They looked at the couplet of putting politics in command and earnestly consulted "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains": The Foolish Old Man has the determination to remove the mountains, don't we young adults have the determination to "gnaw" out big castings? Chairman Mao's works increase ambition, courage, and motivation. They decided to use the spirit of "ants gnawing at bones" to "bite" one bite at a time. Then a battle to overcome technical and equipment difficulties unfolded. There was no big furnace, so the members proposed to repair the broken cupola furnace left over from when they were running steel mills; they borrowed cranes and large blowers from relevant units because they didn't have them. As a result of the hard work, thirty-two large iron tower pipes were made, and the quality fully met the requirements.

### 一副对联的争论

    一副对联的争论
    编者按：这是抓活思想的一个生动的例子，对于我们正在进行的政治和业务关系的辩论很有启发。
    政治和业务，谁统帅谁？对这个问题，许多同志讲起来很明白，遇到具体问题，往往又糊涂了。如果只是进行“课堂式”的辩论，你一套，我一套，不触及思想实际，就很难提高认识。平阳县城关机修社的办法，是一种抓活思想的办法。抓住一些具体事例，引出活思想，就实论虚，展开讨论。由于接触思想实际比较深，解决认识问题也比较透。
    平阳县城关机修社的做法还有一个特点：他们对有争议的问题不忙着做结论，不是把自己的结论强加于人，而是一面议、一面做，让事实来判明是非。这种做法很好。认识来源于实践，有些问题看法不一样，有人同意，有人不同意，可以先做一做，从做的当中去提高认识，这样更有说服力。
    浙江省平阳县城关机修社的车间门口贴着一副对联，上面写着：
              政治挂帅事半功倍
              只抓业务事倍功半
    不知详情的人看来，这是一副平常的对联。谁知，就在贴不贴这副对联上，曾经引起过一场剧烈的争论。
    事情是这样的：
              痛　心
    社里为了活跃社员们的政治文化生活，布置了一个俱乐部。有人建议在俱乐部门口贴副对联。党支部书记程公式想：俱乐部是思想教育的阵地，应该贴一副合适的对联。他翻了翻毛主席的书，对照社里存在的问题，然后在报纸上找到了两句醒目的标题：“政治挂帅事半功倍，只抓业务事倍功半。”他认为很合适。随即让会计写好，贴在俱乐部门口。
    一副鲜红的新对联贴出后，立即有许多人围拢来看。分管业务的干部林寿眉看到“只抓业务事倍功半”沉不住气了，心想：我一年到头东奔西跑，辛辛苦苦为社里联系业务，功劳只有一半吗？他认为机修社没有业务不能生存，社员没有业务不能生活，当然只有狠抓业务，企业才能兴旺起来。至于政治，这是动嘴不动手的事——无关紧要。但奇怪的是，如今老程贴这副对联，是什么意思呢？当时他思想上一时转不过弯来，便去找程公式。
    “老程，社里的实际情况你不知道吗？”
    社里的实际情况程公式怎么不知道呢！当时，机修社的业务清淡，生产任务不足，社员思想较乱，不少人为了多做工时多得工资，只顾数量，不顾质量等等，这些实际问题，林寿眉和程公式都知道。不过在对待这些问题的看法上，各有各的见解。林寿眉认为：业务上有问题，就必须狠抓业务，业务问题解决了，不愁工人的积极性调动不起来；程公式认为：人的因素第一，只要大家觉悟提高了，思想统一了，不愁生产搞不好。
    当时老程笑着说：“社里的实际情况我当然知道。”
    “那你为啥要贴这副对联？”
    “为啥要贴这副对联？”老程痛心地从过去的教训谈起了。
    那是前一个时期，社里生产任务很忙，几个领导干部为业务忙得团团转。当时认为，手工业社与工厂不同，有按件计酬这个“法宝”，不怕社员的积极性调动不起来。因此，就放松了政治思想工作。社员为了多挣钱，干活图快，不顾质量，结果产品大量积压。他们只好削价、削价、再削价！还是推销不出去。一度造成生产无资金，产品无销路。
    谈到这里，老程沉痛地说：“你想想，政治不挂帅，单抓业务，后果怎么样？我们这些当干部的有多少功劳？”
    提起往事，林寿眉也感到十分痛心。眼前社里存在这些问题，他也承认。但是，这些“实际”问题，能用政治挂帅解决吗？他还是摇摇头，表示怀疑。
                    耐　心
    对这副对联的异议，何止干部？在社员当中也引起了热烈的反映：
    “政治看不到，摸不着，生产硬任务，天天坐下来学政治，看你有饭吃没。”
    “讲政治打不开销路，抓业务能打开销路，有工做就有钞票赚。”
    “对联把政治摆得太高，我看政治业务应该平起平坐。”
    这些话，慢慢地传入程公式的耳朵里。
    他真没料到，贴一副对联，竟引起这么大的风波。人们常说，在一些看来是平常的小事情中，往往包含着发人深思的大道理。这副对联正说明这点。这么一想，他的思想豁然开朗了：思想上贴不贴这副对联，决不是一件小事，而是关系到每个人、整个企业兴无灭资的大事。要把这副对联真正地贴在每个干部、社员的思想上，这不是一件轻而易举的事，必然要经历一场激烈的思想斗争。
    不久，贴在俱乐部门口的那副对联突然不见了。有的说是风吹走了，有的说是大扫除扫掉了。不管怎么样，对联总不会自己跑掉。
    这时，党支部有人建议要追查“责任”，查一查对联到底是谁撕掉的。支部书记程公式若有所思地说：“责任就在我身上。”
    大家一听，呆了。
    “是嘛。”老程接着说：“这不能怪社员思想落后，只能怪我没有做好思想工作；这不能埋怨社员不问政治，只能埋怨党支部工作没有突出政治。”他认为自己身为支部书记，面对这些事实，责任只能从自己的身上查起。
    在这紧要关头，他想起了毛主席的教导：有许多时候，群众在客观上虽然有了某种改革的需要，但在他们的主观上还没有这种觉悟，……我们要耐心地等待。毛主席的话，象指路明灯，照亮了他的思想：如果没有群众的自觉和自愿，就会流于徒有形式而失败。对！要耐心等待。正在这时，中共平阳城关镇委给全镇各单位发出了大学毛主席著作典型经验的通知。这给老程启发很大，思想开了窍：要想搞好生产，办好社会主义企业，必须突出政治；而要突出政治，必须认真学习毛主席著作。毛主席的书，一字值千金，毛主席的话，一句顶万句。社里马上组织干部和社员学习“老三篇”，还制订了学习制度。
    说也凑巧，当时社里来了一批油池和炼泥机的加工业务。加工数量多，要的时间急。车间负责人洪阿奶和业务干部林寿眉计算了一下，只有天天加夜班才能完成。于是，他们去找老程商量，要求把每星期两个晚上政治学习停下来搞生产，否则生产任务就完成不了。老程沉思了一会说：“为了使这批任务保质保量地完成，每星期两个晚上的政治学习不但不能停，而且还要加强。”老程觉得这是一批艰巨的生产任务，如果人的积极因素不调动起来，就是天天晚上开夜班，也完成不了。
                      信　心
    任务火烧眉毛，那里还有心坐下来学习，坐在一旁的林寿眉和洪阿奶急得不得了。
    这时程公式让大家学习《为人民服务》。他首先带头联系思想，接触实际，引导社员对照问题谈谈认识。
    机修社的社员大都出身于穷苦的家庭，毛主席的话最爱听。一读毛主席的书，革命的劲头就来了。社员林福西，过去干活总是闹别扭，认为社里没有什么戏轮到他来“唱”。学了《为人民服务》后，他说：“张思德烧炭为革命，我打铁不也是为革命！这么一想。手举铁锤也有了劲。”
      “说得对。”社员李寿田接着说：“我过去干活马虎，也有一个不正确的指导思想，认为干活赚钱为自己，别人管不着，没想到我们生产也是为人民服务。想想过去，真对不起人民。”
    程公式除了每星期两个晚上组织大家学习外，平时利用中午、工前工后的休息时间，找大家谈谈学习心得。学习由浅入深，步步深入。大家纷纷表示：要以实际行动搞好生产，为人民服务。接着，全社开展了生产竞赛，生产进度空前加快，质量不断提高，这批艰巨的任务提前两天保质保量完成了。
    事实是最有说服力的。这项任务完成得如此出色，的确出乎大家的意料。林寿眉更感到惊奇：厂房、机器、设备都是原来的那些；人，也是原来的人，一切客观条件如故。那为啥有这么大的变化呢？于是他如饥似渴地去翻《人的正确思想是从那里来的？》一文，读了一遍又一遍。毛主席说的精神变物质的道理，使他感到十分亲切，也一言道破了他思想上“见物不见人”的毛病。看看毛主席的书，想想眼前的事实，不正说明了“政治挂帅事半功倍”的道理是千真万确吗？
    想到这里，他急急忙忙地跑去找程公式，要求把那副对联重新贴起来。老程说：“这副对联要不要再贴，还是让大家讨论讨论吧！”
                      决　心
    那时，社里的“空气”也变了。社员们常在一起议论学习毛主席著作的体会。写心得，做笔记。就连五十多岁的老社员薛同弟和司炉老师傅施德老也工前学、工后看，回家休息了还叫子女读给他听。职工的精神面貌改变了，为人民服务的观点树立了，社里业务发展了。产值比过去增长一倍，工效也提高一半。
    对于这些变化，社员看在眼里，喜在心里。慢慢地，那副“政治挂帅事半功倍，只抓业务事倍功半”的对联，就在他们的心坎里贴上了。
    在一次职工会议上，工人陈纪律建议重新贴上这副对联，大家几乎异口同声地赞成，并且决定把它贴在车间门口。他们的理由是：车间是生产第一线，贴上这副对联，他们就有了正确处理政治与生产关系的镜子，可以大步前进。
    这一副对联，究竟起多少作用？这是无法用数字表示的。新对联贴上不久，平阳化工厂急需一套硫酸铁塔。铁铸件的任务共二万多斤，其中最大的一个铸件需一吨铁水。这样的任务能承担吗？社里不但未铸过，也未想过。如果在过去，遇到这样的业务，林寿眉早就推了。现在，他首先想到这是生产化肥的重要设备，是关系到支援农业的大事，不能一推了事。于是，他就去车间同大家商量。社员们一听，个个表示一定要承担下来，有天大的困难也要克服。
    生产这么一个大家伙，对于这个小手工业社来说，困难一项项、一件件，无法讲清。他们看看那副政治挂帅的对联，认真请教《愚公移山》：愚公移大山有决心，我们这些青壮年就没有决心“啃”出大铸件？毛主席著作长志、壮胆、出干劲。他们决心用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的精神，一口一口地“咬”。接着一场攻克技术、设备难关的战斗展开了。大炉子没有，社员提出利用办钢铁时留下来的破冲天炉加以修理；没有行车和大型鼓风机，他们找有关单位借到了。奋战结果，三十二只铁塔大管子造出来了，质量完全符合要求。
                                                  仇德盛
