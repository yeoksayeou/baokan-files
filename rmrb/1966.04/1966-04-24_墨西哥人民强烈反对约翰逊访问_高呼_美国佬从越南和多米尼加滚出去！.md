    According to Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City: U.S. President Johnson arrived in the Mexican capital by plane on the 14th for a one-day visit.

    According to Western news agencies, as a "tired"-looking Johnson, under the tight security of six thousand security forces, drove from the airport to the Mexican presidential residence, a group of young people along the road shouted slogans like "We want Vietnam, not Yankees!"
    The next morning, as Johnson was out and about in Mexico City, shouts of anger constantly erupted wherever his car went, including "Johnson is a murderer!" "Yankees get out of Vietnam and the Dominican Republic!" "Yankees go back to your old home!" "No murderers here!" and other slogans. On the evening of the 14th, the "University Radio Station" suddenly stopped broadcasting classical music programs and replaced them with a statement protesting Johnson's visit.
    Johnson's visit took place at a time when the United States was mired in difficulties in other parts of the world, and its relations with Latin American countries had further deteriorated. The American *Vision Letter* recently wrote that the conference to amend the charter of the Organization of American States held in Panama in February and March, had "the harmful result of the United States' isolation. Washington has always tried to prevent the emergence of a bipolar division in the Organization of American States, with Latin American countries on one side and the United States on the other. But this is exactly what happened in the acrimonious atmosphere of Panama (conference)."

### 墨西哥人民强烈反对约翰逊访问  高呼“美国佬从越南和多米尼加滚出去！”

    墨西哥人民强烈反对约翰逊访问
    高呼“美国佬从越南和多米尼加滚出去！”
    据新华社讯　墨西哥城消息：美国总统约翰逊十四日乘飞机到达墨西哥首都进行为时一天的访问。
    据西方通讯社报道，当神色“疲倦”的约翰逊在六千名保安部队的严密保护下从机场驶往墨西哥总统官邸时，路旁一群青年高呼“要越南、不要美国佬！”的口号。
    第二天上午，当约翰逊在墨西哥城外出活动时，汽车所到之处，不断有人愤怒高呼“约翰逊是杀人犯！”“美国佬从越南和多米尼加滚出去！”“美国佬滚回你的老家去！”“这里不要杀人犯！”等口号。“大学电台”十四日晚上还突然停止广播古典音乐节目，代之以一项抗议约翰逊访问的声明。
    约翰逊这次出访，是在美国在世界其它地区陷入重重困境，而同拉丁美洲国家的关系又进一步恶化的时候进行的。美国《视界通讯》最近写道，二、三月间在巴拿马举行的修改美洲国家组织宪章的会议，它的“有害的结局是美国的孤立。华盛顿一向企图防止在美洲国家组织中出现两极分化的精神，即拉丁美洲国家居一方，美国居另一方。但是这一点恰恰在巴拿马（会议）的辛辣气氛中发生了”。
