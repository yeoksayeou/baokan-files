    Commune Members Love to Read Chairman Mao's Books (and another poem)
    Dang Yong'an
    We commune members love to read Chairman Mao's books,
    Reading them makes our hearts hot, so very hot!
    Looking towards Beijing, we won't lose our way,
    With boundless energy to transform heaven and earth,
    Chairman Mao points out the good future for us,
    Hey!
    A round of red sun rises in the East!
    We commune members love to read Chairman Mao's books,
    Reading them makes our hearts hot, so very hot!
    In the books there's timely rain,
    In the books there's ten thousand *dan* of grain,
    Chairman Mao has given us an axe to open mountains,
    Hey!
    Our hands draw a beautiful blueprint!
    We commune members love to read Chairman Mao's books,
    Reading them makes our hearts hot, so very hot!
    In the books there's a demon-revealing mirror,
    Demons and monsters can't escape,
    Chairman Mao has given us boundless courage,
    Hey!
    Our iron fists dare to strike paper tigers!
    We commune members love to read Chairman Mao's books,
    Reading them makes our hearts hot, so very hot!
    Every sentence is heartfelt,
    Every word is like a night-shining pearl,
    Every word, every sentence is forever engraved in our hearts,
    Hey!
    We'll strive for ten thousand years of happiness!
    Climbing High Mountains to Transform the Earth
    We stand shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand,
    We go wherever there are difficulties;
    To dedicate our youth to the revolution,
    Climbing high mountains to transform the earth;
    Dare to struggle, dare to create,
    Our whole bodies are made of hard bones!
    Our war songs roar towards the green mountains,
    Our straw sandals tread through thousands of gullies;
    Our red hearts illuminate Black Stone Cliffs,
    Hot sweat irrigates a great harvest;
    Our hands dig out ten thousand *dan* of grain,
    Our shoulders carry a thousand tons of oil.
    We endure great hardship, withstand great labor,
    The wind and rain make us happy;
    A thousand mountains, ten thousand rivers,
    All smile and nod at us.
    We stand shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand,
    Our lofty aspirations are heroic and high-spirited;
    Looking towards Beijing, our hearts are towards the Party,
    With the world in our hearts, we look at the whole globe.
    Following the red flag, we march, march, march,
    We will never turn back from the revolution!

    社员爱读毛主席的书（外一首）
    党永庵
    咱社员爱读毛主席的书，
    读得心里热呀热呼呼！
    眼望北京不迷路，
    改天换地劲头足，
    毛主席给咱指出好前程哪，
    嗨！
    一轮红日东方出！
    咱社员爱读毛主席的书，
    读得心里热呀热呼呼！
    书中自有及时雨，
    书中自有万担谷，
    毛主席给了咱一把开山斧哪，
    嗨！
    双手画出好蓝图！
    咱社员爱读毛主席的书，
    读得心里热呀热呼呼！
    书中自有照妖镜，
    妖魔鬼怪逃不出，
    毛主席给了咱一身包天胆哪，
    嗨！
    铁拳敢打纸老虎！
    咱社员爱读毛主席的书，
    读得心里热呀热呼呼！
    句句都是贴心话，
    字字好比夜明珠，
    字字句句永远刻在心窝里哪，
    嗨！
    凭它要争来万年福！
    登上高山修地球
    我们肩并肩，手拉手，
    哪里困难哪里走；
    为了革命献青春，
    登上高山修地球；
    敢斗争，敢创造，
    浑身都是硬骨头！
    战歌向着青山吼，
    草鞋踏遍千条沟；
    红心照亮黑石崖，
    热汗浇出大丰收；
    双手挖出粮万担，
    两肩挑来千吨油。
    吃大苦，耐大劳，
    风吹雨打乐悠悠；
    千重山，万条水，
    都向我们笑点头。
    我们肩并肩，手拉手，
    壮志凌云雄赳赳；
    眼望北京心向党，
    胸怀世界看全球。
    跟红旗，走走走，
    革命到底不回头！
