    The more brutal American imperialism is, the more it shows its weakness and approaching end
    The heinous crimes committed by American robbers in South Vietnam are outrageous
    Editor's Note: In order to salvage the failure of its war of aggression against Vietnam, American imperialism is becoming increasingly brutal and savage in South Vietnam. It uses inhumane "Three Alls Policy" and other barbaric means to massacre innocent people in South Vietnam, and has committed countless heinous crimes since the beginning of this year. From this report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, it can be seen that American imperialism is indeed the most ferocious imperialism in the world. Its brutality and barbarism surpass those of Hitler and Japanese fascism.
    When the people rise up to resist imperialist aggression and inflict serious blows on it, the imperialists always try to use the most barbaric means to extinguish the people's anti-aggression struggle. The closer they get to failure, the more frantically they massacre the people. What American imperialism is currently doing in South Vietnam is such a desperate struggle.
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a common saying among Chinese people to describe the behavior of some fools. Reactionaries in all countries are such fools." American imperialism thinks that it can force the South Vietnamese people to submit by relying on poison gas and killing. However, in reality, it has played a role in mobilizing the South Vietnamese people and the people of the world to further rise up against the American aggressors. The more frantically American imperialism kills people in South Vietnam, the clearer its reactionary face is exposed, thus further arousing the hatred of the South Vietnamese people and the people of the world for American imperialism, and making them more determined to rise up and fight against American imperialism. In the final analysis, the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in South Vietnam can only accelerate its final defeat there.
    Hanoi, 5th (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, since the beginning of this year, while continuing to increase troops and transport weapons to South Vietnam and stepping up the expansion of its war of aggression, the American aggressor robbers have also continuously launched large-scale "sweeps" against the liberated areas, implementing the "scorched earth" policy of burning all, killing all, and destroying all. They have also blatantly spread chemical poisons, thrown poison gas bombs, and even sprayed poison gas into residents' shelters, committing outrageous and heinous crimes.
    The main facts of these heinous crimes committed by the American robbers and their running dogs are as follows:
    I. "Sweeping," Slaughtering, Destroying Villages

    美帝国主义越是凶残就越是表明它的虚弱性和末日的临近
    美国强盗在南越犯下新的滔天罪行令人发指
    编者按：为了挽救侵越战争的失败，美帝国主义在南越越来越残暴和野蛮。它使用灭绝人性的“三光政策”等野蛮手段，屠杀南越的无辜人民，今年以来又犯下无数的滔天罪行。人们从越南南方解放通讯社的这篇报道，就可以看出，美帝国主义的确是世界上最凶恶的帝国主义。它的残暴和野蛮，比起希特勒和日本法西斯来，有过之而无不及。
    在人民起来反抗帝国主义的侵略，并给予严重打击的时候，帝国主义者总是想用最野蛮的手段来扑灭人民的反侵略斗争。它们越接近于失败，对人民的残杀就越疯狂。美帝国主义目前在南越的所作所为，就是进行这样一种绝望挣扎。
    毛泽东同志曾经指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”美帝国主义自以为依靠毒气和烧杀可以迫使南越人民屈服。但是，实际上它起了动员南越人民和世界人民进一步起来反对美国侵略者的作用。美帝国主义在南越杀人越疯狂，它的反动面目暴露得就越清楚，从而更加激起南越人民和全世界人民对美帝国主义的仇恨，使他们更加坚决地起来同美帝国主义进行斗争。归根到底，美帝国主义在南越所犯下的滔天罪行，只能加速美帝国主义在南越的最后失败。
    新华社河内五日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，今年以来，美国侵略强盗在继续向越南南方增兵、增运武器，加紧扩大侵略战争的同时，还不断对解放区发动大规模“扫荡”，实行烧光、杀光、毁光的“焦土”政策。他们还明目张胆地撒放化学毒药，投掷毒气弹，甚至向居民的掩蔽洞里喷射毒气，犯下了令人发指的滔天罪行。
