    Greatly Tell Revolutionary Stories
    The extensive mass activities of workers, peasants, and soldiers on the ideological and cultural front, especially the large number of poems published by workers, peasants, and soldiers on wall newspapers and blackboards, as well as the widespread revolutionary storytelling activities, both in content and form, have marked out a completely new era and become a prominent representative of the new situation in the current socialist cultural revolution. Revolutionary stories, as light weapons of socialist literature and art, have played their due role in this struggle to promote the proletarian ideology and eradicate the bourgeois ideology.
    The revolutionary storytelling activities in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs have been carried out early and well. In recent years, under the leadership of the Party, the vast number of amateur storytellers have galloped on the broad literary and artistic front in the countryside, greatly telling about Mao Zedong Thought, great new people, new things, and new customs, and launching a tit-for-tat struggle against the ideological and habitual forces of capitalism and feudalism.
    Their practical activities show that to establish the new of the proletariat and the new of socialism, it is necessary to break the old of the bourgeoisie and the old of feudalism. For a long time, most rural areas and towns' teahouses and bookstores have been occupied by old artists who tell bad books such as "Emperor Qianlong's Visit to Jiangnan" and "The Cases of Lord Peng," spreading poison and corrupting the masses. Some of the four categories of elements used this position to tell stories of gods, ghosts, and karmic retribution, spreading reactionary and pornographic books, and promoting the ideology and lifestyle of the exploiting classes. Similar situations exist in many cities and factories. It is very clear that if the proletariat does not occupy and compete for this vast position, and tolerates the bourgeoisie and feudal classes occupying this position for a long time, it is essentially tolerating the bourgeoisie and feudal classes transforming the broad masses and corrupting the younger generation with their ideas. This is a serious struggle, and the revolutionary masses must take up the weapon of Mao Zedong Thought to fight against them. The activities of greatly telling revolutionary stories in the rural areas of Shanghai's suburbs have vigorously developed in response to the needs of the struggle to promote the proletarian ideology and eradicate the bourgeois ideology.
    Revolutionary stories are popular among the masses, especially the peasant masses, because they meet both the urgent demands of the masses to accept revolutionary culture and conform to the traditional appreciation habits of the Chinese people. Telling stories and listening to stories has a history of thousands of years, but in the past, this literary form, like other literary forms, was used by the exploiting classes as a tool to poison and rule the people. Today, the workers, peasants, and soldiers have transformed its form and infused it with revolutionary content, giving this art form a new life.
    Shanghai's experience tells us that wherever revolutionary storytelling activities are carried out well, there are three common experiences: First, the Party organizations at all levels regard revolutionary storytelling activities as a powerful weapon for promoting Mao Zedong Thought and as a weapon for carrying out socialist education among the peasants; second, they focus on building a team of storytellers; and third, they strive to create new revolutionary stories. They also summarized the three experiences of "moving," "revising," and "creating." These experiences are very good and worth vigorously promoting. New places that are carrying out revolutionary storytelling activities should generally start with "moving," that is, using existing revolutionary stories; the second step is "revising," that is, adapting various literary and artistic works and news communications; and the third step is "creating," that is, taking materials locally and creating revolutionary stories themselves. This third step is very important, because only by constantly creating revolutionary stories that sing the praises of new people and new things in the local area can we more closely link with reality and the masses, and achieve normalization. It should be emphasized here that leaders at all levels should pay attention to cultivating model units, model storytellers, and model stories. With good models and successful experiences in this regard, we can have persuasive power, consolidate our position, and drive the rapid and healthy development of the entire revolutionary storytelling activity.
    Telling revolutionary stories is a new creation of the workers, peasants, and soldiers to meet the needs of the class struggle. It is mastered and utilized by the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and is a new revolutionary thing. Currently, on our literary and artistic front, the struggle to promote the proletarian ideology and eradicate the bourgeois ideology is unfolding fiercely. We must vigorously promote new revolutionary stories, pave the way for them, and use them as weapons in workshops, in the fields, in teahouses... Using socialism and the proletariat as needles, and capitalism and feudalism as edges, greatly tell revolutionary stories, launch a tit-for-tat struggle against everything that poisons and corrupts the people, and consolidate our occupation of all these cultural positions.

### 大讲革命故事

    大讲革命故事
    工农兵在思想、文化战线上的广泛的群众活动，特别是工农兵发表在墙报、黑板报上的大量诗歌，以及广泛展开的革命故事会的活动，无论内容和形式，都划出了一个完全崭新的时代，成为当前社会主义文化大革命的新形势的一个突出代表。革命故事作为社会主义文艺轻武器，在这场兴无灭资斗争中发挥了应有的作用。
    上海郊区农村的革命故事活动开展得又早又好。几年来，广大业余故事员在党的领导下，驰骋在农村广阔的文艺战线上，大讲毛泽东思想，大讲新人新事新风尚，向着资本主义、封建主义的思想和习惯势力展开了针锋相对的斗争。
    他们的活动实践表明：要立无产阶级之新，立社会主义之新，就要破资产阶级之旧，破封建主义之旧。长时期来，大多数农村、集镇的茶馆书场，一直为旧艺人所盘踞，讲的是《乾隆皇帝下江南》、《彭公案》之类的坏书，散布毒素，腐蚀群众；一些四类分子利用这个阵地大讲神仙鬼怪、因果报应的故事，传播反动、黄色书籍，宣扬剥削阶级思想和生活方式。在许多城市、工厂中，也有类似的情形。很清楚，这个广大的阵地，无产阶级不去占领，不去争夺，而容忍资产阶级、封建阶级长期盘踞这个阵地，实质上就是容忍资产阶级、封建阶级，用他们的思想改造广大人民，腐蚀青年一代。这是一场严重的斗争，革命群众必须拿起毛泽东思想这一武器跟他们斗争。上海郊区农村大讲革命故事的活动，正是适应兴无灭资斗争的需要蓬勃开展起来的。
    革命故事所以受到群众特别是农民群众的欢迎，原因在于：它既适应群众接受革命文化的迫切要求，又符合我国人民的传统欣赏习惯。讲故事、听故事已有千百年的历史，但在过去，故事这种文艺形式也象其他文艺形式一样，被剥削阶级用来当作毒害人民、统治人民的工具。今天，工农兵群众改造了它的形式，灌注了革命的内容，使得这一艺术形式得到了新的生命。
    上海的经验告诉我们：凡是革命故事活动开展得好的地方，都有三条相同的体会：一是各级党的组织把革命故事活动当做宣传毛泽东思想的有力武器，当成对农民进行社会主义教育的武器来抓；二是抓好故事员队伍的建设；三是努力于新的革命故事的创作。他们还总结出“搬”、“改”、“创”三条经验。这些经验很好，值得大力推广。新开展革命故事活动的地方，一般是要从“搬”入手，即搬用现成革命故事；第二步是“改”，即改编各种文艺作品和新闻通讯；第三步是“创”，即就地取材，自己创作革命故事。这第三步很重要，因为只有不断创作出歌颂当时当地新人新事的革命故事，才能做到更密切地联系实际、联系群众，做到经常化。这里应该强调的是，各级领导要注意培养样板单位、样板故事员、样板故事。有了好样板，有了这方面的成功经验，才有说服力，才能巩固地占领阵地，才能带动整个革命故事活动迅速、健康地开展。
    讲革命故事是工农兵群众适应阶级斗争需要的新创造，它为工农兵群众所掌握，为工农兵群众所利用，是新生的革命的事物。目前我们的文艺战线上，兴无灭资的斗争正在激烈展开着。我们要大力推广革命新故事，为它鸣锣开道，在车间，在地头，在茶馆……用它作武器，以社会主义、无产阶级之针，对资本主义、封建主义之锋，大讲革命故事，向一切毒害腐蚀人民的东西展开针锋相对的斗争，巩固地占领所有这些文化阵地。
