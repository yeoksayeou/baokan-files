    Battlefield Yellow Flowers are Especially Fragrant
    ——Daqing Letter No. 2
    Wei Gangyan
    Autumn is the season of fierce battles in Daqing. According to the people of Daqing, it is a time of "artillery fire roaring and war horns blowing frequently."
    In 1965, due to heavy tasks and the influx of a large number of new employees, many units were in a "new position, new task, new cadres and workers" situation. The people of Daqing did not first grasp the superficial weaknesses and rush to practice technology; they did not slow down and hold up banners to cross the river by feeling the stones; nor did they go into battle bare-chested and in a chaotic rush. On the contrary, they took the opposite approach. As soon as they started, they brought the team to the high ground of world revolution, pointing out the position of the several technical peaks and the several main battlefields to be fully advanced this year in the revolutionary front spanning five continents. They held high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, blew the bugle of the Internationale, beat the drums of class struggle, and charged forward with whips and sabers.
    The people of Daqing were forged in the flames of war!
    The Daqing team was taught in this way!
    No wonder the people of Daqing call their leaders commanders, the production areas war zones, and the center and forefront of production the front lines!
    Here: The word "front line" is authoritative and the most attractive. In Daqing, all units, all institutional measures, and all thoughts and feelings are born for the battle and fight for the front line.
    Want to be a Daqing person? Go to the front line first! Want to learn the Daqing spirit? Go to the battlefield!
    There is no need to ask about going to the front line. You just stand on the road, wave to the car, and say "Front line!" Someone in the carriage will reach out and pull you up. But I advise you not to rush to a conclusion before you fully understand the identity of the people in the car. Here, it is difficult to distinguish a person's position based on their clothing and belongings.
    Take that black-faced man with a satchel and a bicycle. You might think he is a messenger? But he is a commander leading six or seven thousand people, going from well team to well team to deliver wages to the employees. Their slogan is: "We can't let the soldiers come down from the front line to get ammunition!" You might think that the women sitting on cotton and cloth in the truck are female workers from the clothing factory? They are family members of leading cadres sewing quilts for the well teams scattered on the front line! You might think that the beautiful sedan car is carrying an inspection team from the agency? They are a grass-roots inspection team composed of drillers, oil extraction workers, and family representatives, going to inspect the revolutionization of the agencies, while the party secretary on the roadside, holding an iron shovel and waving to them in salute! In any case, you would never have imagined that in the doctor's pocket for his stethoscope, he also carries a bamboo clapper for performing revolutionary quick stories! And in the large cloth bag at his feet, he is actually carrying stamps, soap, and razors for consignment sales! What should we call them?
    What does it matter if their positions, ages, and experiences are different? From that warm and brief conversation, from the scorching and shining eyes, can't we feel the hot fire of the front line in each of them?
    The front line is not just a position for winning oil, but also a battlefield for promoting the proletariat and eliminating the bourgeoisie, a front for anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and a furnace for training a revolutionary industrial army! It is also the high ground where our class brothers fight fiercely and engage in hand-to-hand combat! Which soldier doesn't want the front line? Doesn't love the front line? Which revolutionary doesn't yearn to fight alongside his comrades? Doesn't strive to go to the blazing furnace?
    The people of Daqing were forged in the flames of war!
    Please let me tell you a small story about a front-line mobile medical team!
    Among the rows of low, dry-stacked earthen houses in Daqing, there is a conspicuous building, the Daqing Workers' Hospital. The people of Daqing affectionately call it the "Big Hospital." Over the years, it has made great contributions to the battle and trained a red medical team. After socialist education, many doctors and nurses felt that they did not have deep roots in the soil of the working class and lacked the iron bones forged in the flames of war. "Go downstairs, go to the front line!" became the call of the entire hospital.
    Three mobile medical teams set off, carrying sickles and medicine kits to the autumn harvest front line; and carrying backpacks and singing songs to the oil field construction and drilling front lines. What a broad vision, what bright sunshine! They carried resolutions and messages written in their notebooks, and their hearts were filled with fantasies of a fresh and tense battlefield life. They arrived at the front line singing and laughing all the way.
    Since it's called the front line, of course, it's very busy. The medical team members shook hands with the enthusiastically receiving comrades, drank water, ate, and then sat on the medicine chests and waited. Strange? Why isn't anyone coming to see a doctor? Okay, let's go to the construction site. There is a small battle going on in digging pipe trenches. This is a good place to start, so they carried their medicine chests and started "patrolling." The workers were burying their heads in battle. After walking around a few times, no one came to the "door." After walking around a few more times, they heard someone whispering behind them: "What are they wandering around for?" Another whispered: "These are doctors from the hospital, here for a patrol." "Oh—". The "patrollers" heard it. A more agile one jumped into the trench and had just dug a few shovels when the workers took the shovel from him with a smile.
    The first day, the patrol ended like this. The sweat-soaked medicine chest wasn't even opened.
    That evening, the three medical teams in different locations all held meetings. Some teams sat on the grass, and some teams sat in dry-stacked earthen houses and tents. Outside the window was the roar of drilling rigs, the workers' chants, and the laughter of family members sharpening sickles. This is the front line, and the front line belongs to the soldiers! Aren't we soldiers? Didn't we try every possible means to be approved to come here? Are we wearing something special? No, some comrades even borrowed a set of old work clothes!
    What to do? People remembered the instructions of the hospital party committee: if there is a problem, ask for instructions from Chairman Mao's writings. Everyone became active. Some people slapped their palms and said, "We should start with investigation and research to find out the number of patients, the types of diseases, the medical records..." Some people hurriedly flipped through books and shouted, "The problem is here, we only thought about crossing the river, but there is no bridge!" Some people bent down to rummage through their bags. Although he knew that this mountain of books, one thicker than the other, contained everything from pharmacopoeias to Latin, it just didn't have this book for curing souls and changing positions! Why does a soldier going to the front line not carry a gun but carry a Latin book? The body went downstairs, but what about the heart? People were asking themselves.
    The clamorous voices suddenly disappeared. Everyone was deeply thinking and digging into the events of today with the spirit of self-revolution... The young nurse Xiao Yin suddenly remembered: when she had just sat down among the workers during a break, a young man sitting next to her immediately moved away and said with a smile, "I have oil on my body!" At the time, she admired the worker's politeness and just smiled foolishly at him. Now that she thought about it, wasn't this an implicit rejection of getting close to that oily work uniform? Can we still be working class like this?… A doctor suddenly remembered: when eating today, although he had forced himself to finish a plate of food he didn't like, he was afraid that the bowls and chopsticks weren't clean and didn't want to touch his lips, so he opened his mouth wide to throw the food in. Oh no, there were several employees next to him, wouldn't this be spread as a joke?… Some people recalled that when a worker got up from his newly laid sheets and just walked out the door, he swept the bed. If you can't even bear to let a worker sit on a sheet, what are you talking about dedicating yourself to the revolution?
    An unforgettable day on the front line! The front line is so strict, so clear. It doesn't listen to beautiful oaths, empty wishes, it only accepts soldiers who dedicate themselves to it!
    Do you want to treat the soldiers' illnesses? Do you want to become a revolutionary doctor who is technically and stylistically excellent? You must gain the soldiers' trust, you must invest in combat, invest in labor, and share their joys and sorrows! You must be anxious about what the soldiers are anxious about, happy about what the soldiers are happy about, and have a soldier's heart and spiritual world! In a word, you must be a true soldier!
    To be revolutionized is not simple. Not just revolution, but also "transformation", how easy is it to talk about! But as long as you are determined and take a step, there is nothing mysterious! The furnace is right in front of you, what are you afraid of the rolling flames? Go in! Afraid of oil? Get some on your hands first! Afraid of mud? Roll around in it! Are you unfamiliar with the front line? Go where the gunfire is thick! Are the soldiers a little strange? Squeeze in!
    The next day, they broke through, going where the work was busy! They went to the cafeteria to wash the bowls they had picked up, went to the construction site to grab shovels and work, went to the workshop to climb high and go low, wiped windows and swept floors! When it came time for dinner in the afternoon, the workers showed kind smiles to these doctors with dusty heads and muddy bodies. Several of them even deliberately gathered at the same table to chat.
    The front line opened a pass for them, but whether they can go deep and become true soldiers? There is no conclusion yet.
    Doctor Xiao Xu, a young man who grew up in a honey pot, used to be playful, loved to eat, and loved to be petty. Now, he took off his cotton coat, wrapped it around the thermos, and sent it to the construction site. When the workers saw him sending water in a single coat, some of them held his cold hand tightly, some were busy putting clothes on him, and handing him bread. Xiao Xu held the hardened steel hand and looked at the rough face, thinking: "Who can calculate how many bitter battles they have experienced? How much wind and rain have they been through? But they never publicize, never ask for credit, and I only did a little thing for them, and the soldiers offered their hearts!" At this time, a young man walked up to him to ask for medical treatment. Xiao Xu humbly said: "I didn't study internal medicine, let's try it..." The young man said: "I don't care what department you're in, the medicine you prescribe must be effective, I trust you!" Xiao Xu realized that there is something more powerful and valuable in the world than medicine and foreign books!
    One day, Xiao Xu and the war zone model worker Doctor Zhang Zhixiao went out, running dozens of miles. They were busy until the afternoon before returning tired and hungry. They were about to turn into the kitchen when they heard a hubbub. Looking over, it turned out to be a familiar team, standing in the pipe trench, scooping out the seeping water bucket by bucket! Xiao Xu couldn't help but stop. He listened to the sound of the buckets hitting the ice slag, and his heart couldn't help but shake. …Zhang Zhixiao said: "Isn't this the time to show strength? Let's go!" They put down their medicine chests and jumped down! An old worker came over and grabbed Xiao Xu's arm and said, "Go back quickly! Eat something before coming!" Xiao Xu was anxious: "This is the time to show strength, let go!"
    After work, the old worker walked side by side with him, looking deeply at Xiao Xu covered in mud and water, and said, "You said it well just now!" Xiao Xu said: "Is that so, you can do it, so can I. I must show this strength!" The old worker shook his head: "No, our strength is to be compared with imperialism! Look!" He held out a hand with two fingers missing and said, "This was bitten off by a mad dog when I was resisting US aggression and aiding Korea. Now it is out of its cage again. I really wish I could extract all the oil at once and burn it to death! Drown it!" Xiao Xu said excitedly: "That's right! Then why didn't you let me go?" The old worker looked up into the distance, remained silent for a while, and said, "The big battle is still ahead! Your body is still tender, the party still wants you to exert great effort! You have to look further!" Xiao Xu suddenly felt his heart light up and a new world flashed before his eyes! He couldn't help but turn sideways, looking at this not-so-tall person, feeling that he was very tall, very big!
    Weren't the people he faced every day in the outpatient department these ordinary people who stood on the peak of the era but were not amazing?
    Nurse Xiao Yin, who usually didn't get a speck of dirt on her body, now tied up her headscarf and swept iron filings and wiped glass, working with enthusiasm. A worker operating a steam hammer walked up to her with his hands spread out: "Medicine, quick! Quick!" He handed out his scratched hand, but his eyes were fixed on the steam hammer. Xiao Yin looked at the bloody wound, as if it was cracking in her own heart. She hurriedly found some mercurochrome. Just as she was about to bandage it, the worker suddenly pulled out his hand and ran straight to the steam hammer. Xiao Yin stood there stunned with a roll of bandages, what happened? She saw him raise his arm, wipe the sweat from his forehead with his sleeve, and go back to work. It turned out that he was reluctant to waste those few seconds! Only a few seconds, why are you doing this! After work, Xiao Yin went to ask the worker, who said, "Time is revolutionary, we don't have the right to waste it!" Xiao Yin's whole body heated up, as if she was standing in the red morning sun. She looked at the face covered in sweat and oil stains, feeling that it was the most beautiful face in the world! That work uniform soaked in oil and sweat was the cleanest clothes in the world!
    Xiao Yin, the spoiled daughter of an old seaman, suddenly couldn't sleep… In 1962, she was selected to go to Daqing. This city girl, who had never even been to the suburbs, boarded a hard-seat sleeper car with a female companion. Like a little bird leaving the nest for the first time, she found everything fresh and funny. She laughed when she heard people snoring. She laughed when she saw people walking. She kept laughing all the way to Daqing. When she got off the bus, she thought, is this a city? And so far away from her mother, she burst into tears… At that time, how narrow her world was! How much revolutionary time had she wasted! She missed the beautiful city, but when she was strolling and singing on the cool seaside road, she never thought that all of this was built by the working class who would not let go of even a few seconds! Xiao Yin thought of her past harsh attitude towards sick employees; she remembered how these soldiers who had come from the smoke of war looked at her when they came to the ward to visit their relatives, and how she frowned at the oily work clothes, fearing that they would dirty the snow-white bedding… Thinking of this, Xiao Yin shed tears of shame.
    The next day, early in the morning, Xiao Yin ran to the dormitory, searching for "oily work clothes" and "sweaty shirts", scrubbing and washing with such enthusiasm. She began to understand where every trace of sweat, every trace of oil, and every flaw on this work clothes came from! Who wrote the two characters "Daqing" and how were they written!
    What rare treasure is an oily work clothes? What is so special about a transferred petroleum worker? Didn't she see them face to face every moment in the hospital? Why were they so close and yet so far away? Why did she yearn for heroes but miss them? Why did her eyes only see the disease and not the person? Why did she only see bones and muscles and not the hearts of class brothers?
    Those who enter the sea see dragons, and those who are soldiers recognize heroes!
    The South Line drilling mobile medical team, regardless of wind or rain, went specifically to where the smoke of gunpowder was thick. The drilling site was surrounded by mist, and the machine roared. The well captain walked up to them and said, "The old driller is back on the drilling platform!" When they heard this, they were anxious: "Didn't we just give him a certificate to rest?" The captain smiled helplessly. They ran up to the drilling platform, thinking that the old driller must be frowning, bending over, and enduring stomach pain to work, but they saw that this man was tilting his head and holding his breath, as if listening to the sound of the drill bit grinding rock cuttings underground. Sure enough, the work was going smoothly, and he even showed a moving smile on his face.
    After much persuasion, they finally replaced him. After taking medicine in the duty room, the old driller felt much better, so he leaned against the wall to rest. Suddenly, two apprentices outside the window were reading the newspaper. They were reading in an indignant voice the news that the enemy was again scattering chemical poisons in large quantities in South Vietnam. As if a faint fire had been poured with a ladle of gasoline, he stood up with a whoosh and walked out. The doctors quickly reached out to stop him, but the old driller slowly and powerfully pushed their hands away and said, "Supporting Vietnam and defeating US imperialism is important." In the blink of an eye, he was back on the drilling platform.
    The medical team members stood under the drilling platform, watching him standing on the drilling platform like an iron statue, and tears welled up in their eyes... What kind of patients haven't they seen? But they have never looked at them with such tears! What stubborn diseases haven't they seen? But they have never had such a strong hatred for disease as today!
    On the grass, they held an emergency meeting with excitement, and decided to: increase the dosage of medicine, treat chronic diseases quickly; deliver medicine on time, observe in a timely manner. Be sure to eliminate the old driller's stomach disease on the drilling platform!
    It was dusk. A female doctor who was most afraid of mosquito bites stared intently at the drillers working in the mosquito swarm on the drilling platform, as if they were biting her. She had an idea and hung cotton dipped in "dichlorvos" around the drilling platform. She forgot about the swarms of mosquitoes stinging her hands and face, and laughed freely.
    It was late at night, and a tense night battle unfolded up and down the drilling platform. The doctors mended clothes and wrote wall newspapers for the drillers under the buzzing lights; in the cold night wind, they went to scoop sand and repair the drilling site. They also knew that there was no need to stay here all night, but no one could persuade them to leave. Who knows what was attracting them here!
    Finally, the medical team members recognized a great class they had lived with day and night but did not know - the Chinese working class! For them, they were willing to bear everything and hand over everything!
    Was it pouring rain? The medical team looked at the watch and saw that it was almost time to deliver medicine to the old driller. Class brothers were still fighting on the drilling platform, so they had to go even if it was raining knives!
    Was it dozens of degrees below zero? In order to treat an old worker's stubborn tinea, Xiao Mou, who had just recovered from hepatitis, was running in the snow, digging up hemp seeds one by one in the frozen soil for making medicine. Someone said: "Is it worth it for this small illness?" Xiao Mou frowned: "Do you know that he can't sleep night after night? Do you know that he went to work again today with bloodshot eyes? Who dares to say this is a small illness?"
    Were they tired? In order to observe a seriously ill patient, they ran back and forth four times an hour at night. The workers stopped them and said, "This is no good, how can you work like this?" They said, "Strange, we are not tired at all when we are with you!" Who knows where this energy came from!
    Was it a difficult disease? They rolled up their sleeves and went to work. Doctor Lao Wu heard that driller Xiao Xu's wife had a mental illness, so he rushed to treat her. Xiao Xu was not there, so he left a letter for Xiao Xu saying, "The medical team will take care of her illness and definitely cure it!" Daring to take responsibility for class brothers and standing up straight!
    Who has the ability to compile a clause on the scope of work of a red medical team? How deep is the class feeling, how broad is the need of the soldiers, and how deep and broad is the scope of their service!
    Seeing that the workers' hair was long, they picked up scissors to learn how to cut hair. Finding that patients were going to mail letters, they quickly sold stamps and department stores on their behalf. Knowing that the hospitalized employees were worried about their families, they visited their homes. After watching the Ulan Muqi performance, they played bamboo clappers to let Wang Jie's heroic image spread throughout the front line!
    Perhaps, some people are worried, won't this affect the improvement of their professional level? As everyone knows, once they come out of metaphysical clauses and disciplines, they will have a clear mind and bright eyes. In this rich and colorful practice, how many "unstoppable" and "barrier breakers" have appeared, and the most valuable thing is: they understand that in treating diseases, in addition to technology and medicine, there is a more effective and great force, that is, class stand, class feeling, and Mao Zedong Thought!
    Severe cold has arrived, and the medical team to be replaced is jumping anxiously in the hospital, but they are trying every means to "rely" on not leaving, as if this is not a front line of ice and snow and bitter fighting, but some kind of wonderful and happy place.
    You're right, "happiness!" That's what they said: "The months on the front line were the happiest moments for me!"
    When Nurse Xiao Yin saw that the man in the oily work clothes who had avoided her that day actually sat next to her one day. She smiled and said: "Are you not afraid of getting oil on me today?" The worker laughed and said, "You have a lot of oil on your body too!" When he said goodbye, he stretched out a big hand covered in oil. When she held this big hand tightly, who could be happier than her?
    When they opened the drawer and saw a bunch of hot, tender corn, they chewed slowly, imagining the appearance and friendship of the unknown employee who sent the corn. For the first time in their lives, they tasted such a deep and lingering sweetness!
    Before leaving, an old worker held Doctor Xiao Xu's hand and said deeply: "I heard that you have been approved to go with the motorcade to the mountains to transport materials, train well! Grind away all your student spirit! Train a pair of steel bones and iron muscles, the girder of the world revolution still depends on us to go up!" He listened to this earnest advice with tears. He shook hands with the workers who came to see him off one by one, and the surging class feelings communicated in their eyes! An unforgettable happy moment!
    These medical team members, who temporarily returned to the hospital to receive new tasks, walked on the road, their faces black, their hands rough. They stared at the oil field covered in the first snow, strong and calm one by one. They seemed to be silently silent, but a new song that hadn't been composed yet surged in their hearts…
    Under the vast snow-covered plain, they saw the black oil pipelines, and they saw the eyes of the welder under the electric welding arc, the red flag commanding the crane like a sword, and the pipelines advancing in the voices of the soldiers, their chants, laughter, and shouts! Under the blue sky, they recognized the derricks where they and their masters had poured all their heart and soul. Through the faint sound of the drilling rig, they seemed to hear the old driller's calm and steady command again, the clang of the drillers fiercely fastening the big pliers, and the sound of themselves running towards the derrick in the pouring rain with medicine chests on their backs…
    The wheels were spinning. Patches of wheat fields, well houses, derricks, points, lines, patches… For the first time, they felt that their entire flesh, nerves, and oil field were connected as one! For the first time, they saw that on the thousand-mile snow-covered plain, in the cold wind, battlefield yellow flowers were bravely emerging from the soil, blooming densely and vigorously!
    The wheels were speeding, "We are walking on the road!" The wheels were speeding, "Arise, ye prisoners of starvation!" The wheels were speeding, go to the front line! Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, stepping through knee-deep mud and facing the flood peaks! Knock on the firewood door of the poor peasant brothers by treading half a foot of snow! Like Chen Yonggui, striding towards the Dashishan Mountain! Like Wang Jie, not afraid of hardship, not afraid of death, striding forward with his chest forward!
    True soldiers are born in the raging fire! The broad road is cut open with sharp swords! The victory of the people comes from the battlefield yellow flowers!

    战地黄花分外香
    ——大庆书简之二
    魏钢焰
    秋天，是大庆的鏖战季节，按大庆人的说法，这是个“炮火连天响，战号频吹”的时光。
    一九六五年，由于任务繁重和大批新职工的涌进，不少单位处于“岗位新、任务新、干部工人新”三新牌的情况下。大庆人没有先抓那表面上的薄弱环节，忙着去先练技术；没有放慢步子抱上锦旗去摸着石头过河；更不是赤膊上阵一轰而上。他们反其道而行，一上手就把队伍带到世界革命的高地上来，指出今年要攻占的几座技术高峰、几条要全面突进的主战场在横跨五大洲的革命阵线中所占的位置。他们高举毛泽东思想的帅旗，吹起国际歌的号角，擂起阶级斗争的战鼓，拍马扬刀杀了上去。
    大庆人，就是这样从战火中炼出来的！
    大庆的队伍，就是这样教出来的！
    无怪乎，大庆人把他们的领导人称做指挥，把生产区域叫战区，把生产的中心和前沿叫前线！
    在这里：“前线”这个词儿是权威的，是最有吸引力的。在大庆，一切单位，一切制度措施，一切思想感情都是为会战而生，为前线而战的。
    要做大庆人么？就先到前线去吧！要学大庆精神么？就上战场去吧！
    上前线是用不着打问的。你只站在公路上，向汽车一招手，说声“前线！”车厢里就会有人伸出手把你拽上去。但我劝告你，在没完全弄清同车人的身份前，不要忙着下断语。在这里，你很难根据一个人的服装和所带的物件去分辨他的职务。
    就说那位背个挎包蹬辆自行车的黑脸汉子吧，你以为他是位通讯员么？他却是一个领导六七千人的指挥，这时正挨井串队的去把工资送到职工手中。他们的口号是：“不能叫战士下火线来领弹药！”你以为那卡车里坐在棉花与布匹上的妇女们，是被服厂的女工么？她们却是些领导干部的家属为散居前线的井队去缝棉被的！你以为那辆漂亮的大轿车里坐的是机关的巡视团么？他们却是一个由钻工、采油工、家属代表组成的基层检查团，正去检查机关革命化，而路边那位手持铁锹，向他们挥手致敬的却是位党委书记！无论如何你也想不到，在医生装听诊器的口袋里还带着一副说革命快书的竹板吧！在他脚下的大布包里，竟然包的是代销的邮票、肥皂和刮胡刀吧！该把他们叫什么员呢？
    职务、年龄、经历的不同有什么关系？从那热烈短促的交谈里，灼热闪亮的目光里，在他们每个人身上，我们不是都能感觉到前线那股热腾腾的火劲儿么？
    前线，不只是个夺油的阵地，它更是兴无灭资的战场，反帝反修的前沿，锻炼革命产业大军的熔炉！它也是咱阶级弟兄苦斗恶战、白刃交手的高地！那一个战士不想前线？不爱前线？那一个革命者，不渴望和自己的战友并肩战斗？不力争到火焰熊熊的熔炉中去？
    大庆人，就是从战火中炼出来的！
    请听我讲一支前线巡回医疗队的小故事吧！
    在大庆那一排排矮小的干打垒房屋中，有一所显眼的楼房，那就是大庆职工医院。大庆人亲切地称呼为“大医院”，几年来，它为会战立下了汗马功劳，锻炼了一支红色医疗队伍。经过社会主义教育以后，不少的医生护士们，感到脚下没有扎在阶级土壤里的深根，缺少战火中炼出来的铁人骨头。“下楼去，到前线去！”成了全医院的呼声。
    三个巡回医疗队出发了，到秋收前线的手持镰刀身背药箱；到油田建设和钻井前线的也都背着背包唱着歌曲踏上征途。好宽的眼界呵，好亮的阳光呵！他们揣着小本上写的决心、赠言，心里幻想着新鲜而紧张的战地生活，一路歌声笑声到了前线。
    既叫前线，当然很忙，医疗队员和热情接待的同志握过手，喝过水，吃过饭，就坐在药箱上等起来了。怪？怎么没人上门看病？好，下工地去。挖管沟的正有个小会战，这可算找到了地方，就背着药箱“巡回”起来了。工人们正埋头奋战，走了几遍，没人上“门”，再走几遍，就听见背后有人小声说：“他们转悠什么呀？”另一个低声说：“这是医院的大夫，来巡回的。”“哦——”，“巡回”的人听见了，一个机敏些的跳下沟去，刚挖了几锹，就被工人笑着把锹夺走了。
    第一天，巡回就这样结束了，汗水浸湿的药箱连盖也没打开。
    当晚，分处各地的三个医疗队都开会了。有的队坐在草地上，有的队坐在干打垒和帐篷里。窗外是钻机的轰鸣声，职工们的号子声，磨镰刀的家属们的笑声。这儿是前线，而前线是属于战士的！难道，我们不是战士？我们不是千方百计要求才被批准来的么？难道，我们穿的特殊？不呵，有的同志还特意借了一身旧工服嘛！
    怎么办呢？人们想起了医院党委的指示，有问题就去请示毛主席著作。大家活跃起来了，有的用拳击掌说：“咱们应该从调查研究入手，搞清患者的人数、病型、病历……”有的匆匆翻着书，喊道：“问题在这儿，我们只想过河，而没有桥！”有的弯下腰去翻书包。虽然他明知这一本比一本厚的书山里，从药典到拉丁文，样样俱全，就偏偏没有这本治灵魂改立场的书！为什么一个赴前线的战士不带枪，却扛了本拉丁文来？身子下了楼，心呢？人们都反问着自己。
    喧嚷的声音一下子消失了，大家以自我革命精神深思苦挖着今儿一天的事……年青的护士小尹忽然想起：她刚插空坐在工人中间，一个挨着她坐的小伙子立刻挪走，笑着说：“我身上有油！”当时自己还很赞赏工人的礼貌，只是傻呵呵地对他笑笑。现在一想，这不是默认不想靠近那件油工服么？这样，还能做个工人阶级么？……有个大夫忽然想起：今天吃饭时，虽然把一盘不喜欢的菜硬吃完了，可又怕碗筷不干净，不愿沾嘴唇，就张大嘴朝里丢菜。糟糕，旁边还有几个职工，这还不当笑话传出去么？……有的人回忆起，一位工人从他铺的新床单上起来，刚走出门，自己就扫起床来。连张床单都舍不得让工人坐，还说什么献身革命？
    难忘的前线一日呵！前线，就这么严格，这么严明。它不听动听的誓言，空洞的愿望，它只接受献身给它的战士！
    根子找到了！他们一字字地读着毛主席的话：“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”毛主席呵，您把什么都看透了，听到了！要没有变自己为工农民众的决心，不敢在世界观上刺刀见红，没有向“我”字开炮的狠劲，调查研究也好，要解决桥的问题也好，就都是一句空话！
    你想给战士治疗病么？想成为一个技术上作风上过硬的革命医生么？你就必须得到战士的信任，你就得投入战斗、投入劳动，和他们同甘共苦生死与共！你就得急战士之所急，喜战士之所喜，有一颗战士的心和精神世界！一句话，你就得是一个真正的战士！
    要革命化，自不简单。不止革命，还要“化”，谈何容易！但只要铁了心，迈开步，也没有什么神秘！熔炉就在眼前，怕什么火焰滚滚？进去就是！怕油吗？先沾它一手！怕泥么？偏滚它一身！前线不熟悉么？专朝枪声密处走！战士有点生么？硬往一块挤！
    第二天，他们就闯开了，那里活忙往那儿走！下食堂捞起碗就洗，到工地抢过锹就干，进车间登高爬低，擦窗扫地！到下午吃饭时，这些满头灰尘、一身泥斑的大夫们买饭的时候，工人们对他们显出亲切的笑容，有几个还特意和他们凑到一桌，拉起家常来。
    前线为他们开了通行证，但能否深入，成为真正的战士？还没有结论。
    小许大夫，这个蜜罐里长大的青年，过去贪玩爱吃，爱耍个小性子。如今，他脱下了身上的棉袄，包在开水壶上向工地送去。工人们见他穿件单衣来送水，有的紧握住他那冰凉的手不放，有的忙着为他披衣服，向他递来面包。小许握住那炼硬了的钢手，望着那磨粗了的脸面，心想：“谁能算出，他们经历过多少次苦战恶斗？经历过多少风吹雨淋？可他们从不宣扬，从不邀功，而自己只为他们做了一点小小的事，战士们就捧出了自己的心！”这时，一个小伙子向他走来求医，小许谦虚道：“我不是学内科的，咱们试试……”小伙子却说：“管你是什么科，你开的药一定灵，我信得过你！”小许才知道，世界上还有一种比药物和洋书更有力更可贵的东西！
    一天，小许和战区标兵张志孝医生出去，跑了几十里路，一直忙到下午，才又累又饿地回来，好容易看到伙房的烟囱，正想拐弯走进去，忽听人声喧哗，一看，原来是一个熟识的小队，正在管沟里，脚踩渗出的水一桶桶地正往出舀！小许不由停了步，他听着水桶碰击冰渣的声音，心中不由一震。……张志孝说：“这不正是那叫劲的时候么？下！”他们把药箱一放就跳下去了！一位老工人过来扯住小许的臂膀说：“快给我回去！吃了饭再来！”小许急了：“这正是叫劲的时候，你松开！”
    收工以后，老工人和他并肩走着，深情望望满身泥水的小许说：“你刚才说得好！”小许说：“是么，你们能干我也能，我非叫这个劲不可！”老工人摇了摇头：“不，咱们的劲要和帝国主义去较！你看！”他伸出一只残废了两个手指的手说：“这是我在抗美援朝时候叫疯狗咬掉的，如今它又出笼了，我真是恨不得把所有的油一下开出来，烧死它！淹死它！”小许激动地说：“对呀！那你为啥不让我上？”老工人抬头向远方看去，沉默了一会，说：“大仗还在后边哪！你身子骨还嫩，党还要你出大力呢！得看远点！”小许忽觉心中一亮，眼前闪出个新天地！他不由侧过身，望着这个并不魁梧的人，觉得他很高，很大！
    在门诊部，自己面对面天天打交道的人，不就是这些貌不惊人而立在时代高峰的普通人么？
    护士小尹，平日身上连个土点儿也不沾，如今她扎起头巾扫铁屑、擦玻璃，正干得起劲，一个操纵汽锤的工人扎煞着手向她走来：“药，快！快！”他递出了擦破的手，眼睛却直盯着汽锤。小尹看着沁血的伤口，就象裂在自己心上，她慌忙找出红汞，刚上完药，正要包扎，那工人却猛然抽出了手，向汽锤直奔而去了。小尹拿着一卷绷带怔在那里，怎么回事？只见他举起手臂，用衣袖擦擦头上的汗珠，又干上啦。原来，他是舍不得这短短的几秒钟呵！才几秒钟呵，你，为什么呵！下班以后，小尹去问那位工人，工人说：“时间是革命的，咱没有权利浪费！”小尹全身一热，象是站在通红的朝阳里。她望着这个汗气腾腾、沾着油渍的脸，觉得这是世界上最美的面孔了！那件渗满油痕汗迹的工衣，是世界上最干净的衣服了！
    小尹，这个老海员的娇女，突然睡不着了……一九六二年她被选拔到了大庆，这个连城郊都没去过的城市姑娘，和一个女伴上了硬席卧车。就象那第一次出窝的小鸟，见了什么都新鲜，都好笑。听人家打呼噜，笑。看人家走路，笑。一直傻笑到大庆。下车一看，这那儿象个城市？又离开妈妈那么远，就哭开了……那时节，自己的天地多么窄小呵！浪费了多少革命的时间！自己留恋美丽的城市，但在那清爽的海滨马路散步欢唱的时候，却从没想到这一切，都是这个连几秒钟也不肯放过的工人阶级建造的！小尹想起了过去对患病职工的生硬态度；记起了这些从战火硝烟中走来的战士，到病房看望自己的亲人的时候，自己如何皱着眉头看着那件油工衣，唯恐他碰脏了雪白的床褥……想到这里，小尹流出了羞愧的热泪。
    第二天，一大早，小尹就跑到宿舍，搜寻着“油工服”“汗衬衫”，那么起劲地搓呵，洗呵。她开始懂得，这工服上的每片汗迹，每道油痕，每个破绽是怎么来的！大庆这两个字是由谁写的，是怎么写的！
    一件油工服是什么罕世珍宝？一个转业的石油工人有什么稀奇？在医院时那一刻不和他们脸对脸？为什么近在咫尺而远在天涯？向往英雄而失之交臂？为啥过去眼睛里只见病而不见人？只见骨胳肌肉而不见阶级弟兄的心？
    入大海者见蛟龙，是战士者识英雄呵！
    南线钻井巡回医疗队，风雨不避，专向硝烟浓处走。井场上团团雾气，轰轰机声，井队长向他们走来说：“老司钻又上钻台了！”他们一听急了：“我们不是才给他开了休息证么？”队长无奈地笑了笑。他们奔上钻台，原以为老司钻一定是拧眉弯腰忍着胃痛干活，不料，却见这汉子正侧个头提着气，象是倾听着钻头在地下辗磨岩屑的声音。八成，工作得挺顺手，他脸上还显出动人的笑容。
    好说歹说才把他换下来，在值班房里吃过药，老司钻觉得好多了，就靠在墙上歇着。忽然窗外两个学徒工正在念报。他们用激愤的声音，读着敌人在越南南方又大批撒放化学毒药的消息。就象一团微弱的火被泼了一瓢汽油，他呼地站起来，往外就走。医生们伸手急忙去拦，老司钻缓慢而有力地推开了他们的手，说：“支援越南，打败美帝要紧。”转眼就上了钻台。
    医疗队员们站在钻台下，看着他象座铁象似的站立在钻台上，热泪涌到了眼眶……什么样的病人他们没见过？可从没有这样含着热泪去看过他们！什么刁顽病症他们没见过？可从没有过今天对疾病的强烈仇恨！
    在草地上，他们激昂地开着紧急会议，决定了：加重药剂，慢病快治；按时送药，及时观察。一定要把老司钻的胃病消灭在钻台上！
    黄昏了，一个最怕蚊虫咬的女医生，目不转睛地看着钻台上在蚊群中工作的钻工们，就象咬着她自己。她急中生智，把蘸了“敌敌畏”的棉花挂在钻台周围。她忘了叮在自己手脸上的蚊群，而放怀地笑了。
    夜深了，钻台上下展开了紧张的夜战。医生们在灯蛾嗡嗡的灯下，为钻工们补衣服，写墙报；在凛冽的夜风中，去捞沙子，修井场。他们自己也知道，没必要整夜待在这里，但谁也劝不走他们。谁知道，这里有什么吸住了他们！
    终于，医疗队员们认识了一个曾朝夕共处而并不相识的伟大阶级——中国工人阶级！为了他们，自己愿意承受一切，交出一切！
    瓢泼大雨么？医疗队员一看表，给老司钻送药时间快到了，阶级弟兄还在钻台上战斗呢，下刀子也要去！
    零下几十度么？为了给一位老工人治顽癣，肝炎刚好就来到医疗队的小牟正跑在雪地里，在冻土里一颗颗地抠着配药用的大麻子。有人说：“为这个小病，值得么？”小牟眉头一皱：“你知道，他一夜夜的睡不好么？你知道，他今天又熬红了眼睛去上班么？谁敢说这是小病？”
    累么？为了观察一个重病人，在夜间，一个钟头就来回跑了四次，工人们拦住说：“这还行，那有这么干活的？”他们说：“怪不怪，和你们在一块，我们就一点也不累！”谁知道，那儿来的这股子劲！
    是疑难病症么？他们挽袖子就上，老吴医生只是耳闻钻工小徐的爱人有了精神病，就急忙赶去治疗。小徐不在，就留信给小徐说：“医疗队把她的病包下，一定治好！”为阶级弟兄敢于承担责任，挺胸而出！
    谁有本事能编出本红色医疗队的工作范围条款？阶级感情有多深，战士的需要有多广，他们服务的范围就有多深多广！
    看见工人头发长了，就抄起剪刀学理发。发现病人去邮信，就赶快代售邮票和百货。知道住院的职工操心家里，就去他家探访。看了乌兰牧骑演出，就打起竹板，让王杰的英雄形象走遍前线！
    也许，有人担心，这不会影响他们业务水平的提高么？殊不知，他们一旦从形而上学的条条和分科里走出来，就思路大开，心明眼亮。在这场丰富多彩的实践中，出现了多少位“挡不住”“闯关手”，而最可贵的是：他们懂得对待疾病，在技术和药物之上，还有一种更有效的伟大力量，那就是阶级立场，阶级感情，毛泽东思想！
    严寒已经到了，要换班的医疗队在医院急得直跳，而他们却千方百计“赖”着不走，倒象这儿不是冰天雪地恶战苦斗的火线，而是个什么美妙幸福的境地。
    你算说着了，“幸福！”他们就是这么说的：“前线数月是我最幸福的时刻！”
    当护士小尹看见那天远躲开她的穿油工服的汉子，一天居然擦着她身边坐下。她笑说：“你今天不怕给我蹭上油了么？”那工人大笑说：“你身上的油也不少哇！”临走告别时，还伸出一只沾满机油的大手。在她紧握着这只大手时，还有谁比她更幸福？
    当他们打开抽屉，看见一束热腾腾的嫩玉米，他们一边细嚼慢咽着，一边想象着这位送玉米的不知名职工的模样和友情。一生中，还是第一次尝到这么深悠的甜味！
    临行时，一位老工人握住小许大夫的手，深情地说：“听说你被批准跟车队到山区去运料，好好锻炼吧！把你的学生气都磨光！练出副钢骨铁筋来，世界革命的大梁还要靠咱们去上咧！”他含泪听完这语重心长的劝告。挨次和送行的工人们一一握手，滔滔的阶级感情在他们目光中交流！难忘的幸福时刻呵！
    这些暂时回医院去领受新任务的医疗队员们走在大路上，他们的脸黑了，手粗了，他们凝望着覆盖了初雪的油田，一个个结实而沉静。他们似乎是默默无声，而心中却涌荡一首还没编好的新歌……。
    在茫茫雪原下，他们看见了一条条乌黑的油管，又看见了那电焊弧光下焊工的眼睛，指挥吊车的红旗剑似地劈砍，管道在战士们和自己的号子声、笑声、呐喊声中前进！在碧蓝的天空下，他们认出了自己和师傅们洒下全部心血的井架。透过隐隐的钻机声，仿佛又听见老司钻沉着稳健的口令声，钻工们狠狠扣大钳的铿锵声，自己背着药箱在瓢泼大雨中向井架的奔跑声……
    车轮飞转。片片麦田，口口井房，座座井架，分点、连线、成片……他们第一次觉得：自己的整个血肉、神经和油田连成了一片！第一次看见：在千里雪原上，凛冽寒风中，战地黄花正夺土而出、蓬蓬丛丛，开得正闹！
    车轮飞奔，“我们走在大路上！”车轮飞奔，“起来饥寒交迫的奴隶！”车轮飞奔，上前线去！象焦裕禄同志那样踏着齐膝深的泥水，面迎洪峰前进！踩半尺厚的大雪去叩打贫农弟兄的柴门！象陈永贵那样挺胸走向大石山！象王杰那样不怕苦，不怕死，挺着胸脯前进！
    真正的战士，在熊熊烈火中诞生！宽广的道路，靠锋利的刀剑砍劈！人民的胜利，从战地黄花里走来！
