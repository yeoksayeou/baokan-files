    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd: During the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association, Ri Morrison, head of the Azanian (South African) Journalist Delegation, emphasized in his speech on the 22nd that painful lessons have taught them that "'peaceful' coexistence and a policy of cooperation with the enemy is a bankrupt and dangerous policy that must be thoroughly exposed and opposed."

    He said that victory can only be achieved by dealing with imperialism with force. However, some "friends" are supporting a certain group that has long been rejected by the Azanian people, and they have united to oppose the Azanian people.

    At the meeting, Morrison, on behalf of the 14 million oppressed and discriminated Azanian people struggling, congratulated the meeting and expressed the fullest and unequivocal support for Chavdar's general report and the report on the evacuation of the Secretariat, and complete support for the decisions made and actions taken by the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association to defend and maintain the revolutionary guiding principle of the Afro-Asian Journalists Association - the Jakarta Declaration.

    When talking about the Azanian people's struggle, Morrison condemned the crimes of US-British imperialism. He said that in Azania, the reactionary forces headed by Verwoerd, the lackey of Wall Street and London, have begun a period of terror, threats, and massacres against our people. Our patriots are being tortured, imprisoned, persecuted, exiled, and so on. To this day, more than 5,000 revolutionaries, staunch supporters of the Pan-Africanist Congress, are suffering in prison, our revolutionary party has gone underground, and our leaders have been imprisoned indefinitely. At the same time, our capitalists and the US-British monopolists are becoming richer and fatter based on our suffering and toil.

    Morrison said that the Azanian people cannot be intimidated. They are fearless. They have decided to take up arms to oppose Verwoerd and his running dogs, tools of the imperialists and colonialists headed by the main enemy of mankind, the United States. Through painful lessons, we have learned that the policy of “peaceful” coexistence and cooperation with the enemy is a bankrupt and dangerous policy that must be thoroughly exposed and opposed. We have learned that we can only achieve victory by dealing with imperialism with force. But some people are supporting bankrupt and dying anti-people groups in various countries. In our country, these "friends" support a certain group that has long been rejected by the Azanian people. They conspire against us, oppose us, and prevent us from occupying our rightful place in the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization. They have united to oppose us. But they will suffer a shameful defeat, just like the dying running dog groups they support in Azania.

    Morrison said that the Afro-Asian Journalists Association is a revolutionary, anti-imperialist journalists' organization. As such an organization, it will, and can only, cooperate and work together with other staunch anti-imperialist journalists' organizations. The AAJA cannot and will not cooperate with those journalists' organizations that only talk about anti-imperialist struggle in words but in practice cooperate closely with organizations like the International Organization of Journalists.

    He said that some journalists' organizations only talk about cooperating with the AAJA in words - but they launch vicious attacks on the AAJA in their own publications. They accuse the AAJA of "being racial segregationists in the journalists' ranks," and also say that - "the separate establishment of an AAJA due to China's efforts, and its opposition to progressive European journalists' organizations, of course means the weakening of the anti-imperialist front."

    Morrison said that this is exactly the racist argument, which comes from the mouths of those who think racism and great-power chauvinism are dead. In the eyes of these people, anything regional is "splittist." In the eyes of these people, anything not under their command is "racist." This is an insult to all of us here. These great-power chauvinists do not believe that journalists from Africa and Asia can form their own anti-imperialist journalists' organization.

    He said, how can we have close contact with these so-called "friends"? They are not our friends, they are splitters, partners of imperialism.

    The Azanian (South African) people hope that the AAJA will not waste time elaborating on dialogues with these "friends." We would rather spend our precious time building our Afro-Asian Journalists Association and resolutely fighting against imperialism led by the United States.

    He said that the Azanian people cheer for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people against US imperialism. The Azanian people fully support and praise the struggles of all African, Asian, and Latin American brothers.

    Morrison said that we resolutely condemn the fascist military dictatorship now being implemented in Indonesia, the brutal massacre of our brothers, and the imprisonment of our friends. We also condemn the military coup instigated by the United States in Ghana. The Azanian people will always stand with our brothers in the eye of the storm. He said that no force can stop the Afro-Asian people from achieving final victory. No force can stop the Afro-Asian people from finally burying US imperialism.

    阿扎尼亚（南非）新闻工作者代表团团长摩里逊的发言
    只有以武力对付帝国主义才能取得胜利
    新华社二十三日讯阿扎尼亚（南非）新闻工作者代表团团长里·摩里逊二十二日在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上发言时强调指出，痛苦的教训使他们懂得了，“‘和平’共处以及同敌人合作的政策，是一种已经破产和危险的政策，必须予以彻底的揭露和反对”。
    他说，只有以武力来对付帝国主义才能取得胜利。但是，有些“朋友”却在支持早已被阿扎尼亚人民唾弃的某个集团，他们联合起来反对阿扎尼亚人民。
    摩里逊在会上代表一千四百万受压迫、受歧视的阿扎尼亚斗争的人民，向会议表示祝贺，并且对查禾多的总报告和关于书记处撤离的报告表示最充分的、毫不含糊的支持，对亚非新闻工作者协会书记处为保卫和维护亚非新闻工作者协会革命的指导原则——雅加达宣言——而作出的决定和采取的行动表示完全支持。
    摩里逊在谈到阿扎尼亚人民的斗争时，谴责了美英帝国主义的罪行。他说，在阿扎尼亚，以华尔街和伦敦的走狗维沃尔德为首的反动势力已开始一个恐怖、威胁和大规模屠杀我国人民的时期。我国的爱国者正受到拷打、监禁、迫害、放逐等等。到今天，有五千多个革命者、泛非主义者大会的坚决拥护者现在在监狱中遭受苦难，我们的革命的党已转入地下活动，我们的领导人被无限期监禁。与此同时，我国的资本家和美英垄断资本家却在我们受苦受累的基础上变得越来越富有、越养越肥了。
    摩里逊说，阿扎尼亚人民是吓不倒的。他们是无所畏惧的。他们已决定拿起武器来反对以人类的主要敌人美国为首的帝国主义者和殖民主义者的工具、维沃尔德及其走狗。我们通过痛苦的教训已经知道了，“和平”共处以及同敌人合作的政策，是一种已经破产和危险的政策，必须予以彻底的揭露和反对。我们已经知道，我们只有以武力来对付帝国主义才能取得胜利。但是却有人支持各国的已经破了产和垂死的反人民集团。在我国，这些“朋友”支持早已被阿扎尼亚人民唾弃的某个集团。他们对我们施展阴谋，反对我们，阻止我们在亚非人民团结组织中占有我们的合法地位。他们联合起来反对我们。但是他们将象他们在阿扎尼亚支撑的垂死走狗集团一样地遭到可耻的失败。
    摩里逊说，亚非新闻工作者协会是一个革命的、反帝的新闻工作者组织。作为这样一个组织，它将要，并且只能同其它坚决反帝的新闻工作者组织进行合作和一起工作。亚非记协不能，也不会同那些新闻工作者组织合作，那些组织只在口头上谈反帝斗争而在实际上却同象国际新闻工作者联合会那样的组织进行密切的合作。
    他说，有一些新闻工作者组织只是在口头上谈同亚非记协进行合作——但是它们却在自己的刊物上对亚非记协进行恶毒的攻击。它们指责亚非记协“是新闻工作者队伍中以种族差别为基础的分裂主义者”，并且还说——“由于中国的努力才另外建立了一个亚非记协，并且要它同进步的欧洲新闻工作者组织相对立，这当然意味着反帝阵线的削弱”。
    摩里逊说，这正是种族主义的论调，这种论调出自那些认为种族主义和老大哥沙文主义已经死亡的人们之口。在这些人看来，任何区域性的东西都是“分裂主义的”。在这些人看来，任何不受他们指挥的东西都是“种族主义的”。这是对我们这里所有人的侮辱。这些老大哥沙文主义者不相信，来自非洲和亚洲的记者们能够成立他们自己的反帝的新闻工作者组织。
    他说，我们怎么能够同这些所谓的“朋友”进行密切的接触呢？他们不是我们的朋友，他们是分裂主义者，是帝国主义的合伙者。
    阿扎尼亚（南非）人民希望亚非记协不要浪费时间，来精心安排同这些“朋友”的对话。我们宁可把我们宝贵的时间用于建设我们的亚非记协，并且坚决同以美国为首的帝国主义进行斗争。
    他说，阿扎尼亚人民欢呼越南人民反对美帝国主义的正义斗争。阿扎尼亚人民完全支持和赞扬所有非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲兄弟的斗争。
    摩里逊说，我们坚决谴责现在在印度尼西亚实行的法西斯军事独裁专政、野蛮屠杀我们的兄弟、囚禁我们的朋友。我们同样谴责美国在加纳策动的军事政变。阿扎尼亚人民将始终同我们的处于风暴中心的兄弟们站在一起。他说，任何力量都阻止不了亚非人民取得最后胜利。任何力量都阻挡不了亚非人民最后埋葬美帝国主义。
