    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 24th—More than 1,200 young people in the capital held a rally this afternoon to commemorate April 24th, Anti-Colonialism Day.
    Qian Dawei, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation; Nguyen Minh Phuong, Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation in China of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front; Sanna Mamadou Laminah, representative of the Guinean African Democratic Revolution Youth Organization; and Jaime González, a friend of the youth of Colombia, spoke at the meeting. They condemned the crimes of aggression committed by US imperialism around the world, expressed their support for the Vietnamese people's struggle against US aggression and for national salvation, and their support for the struggles of people and youth from all countries against imperialism and colonialism.
    Qian Dawei said in his speech that wherever there is aggression and oppression by US imperialism, there will be resistance and struggle by the people. The glorious victory achieved by the Vietnamese people and youth in the struggle against US aggression and for national salvation once again eloquently proves that US imperialism is nothing but a paper tiger, strong in appearance but brittle in reality, and that people's war is the best magic weapon for defeating US imperialism and its lackeys.
    Qian Dawei condemned the modern revisionism centered on the leadership group of the CPSU for betraying the interests of the people of the world, serving US imperialism, and undermining the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Countless facts show that modern revisionism centered on the leadership group of the CPSU has become an accomplice of US imperialism, playing the role of a "fire brigade" attempting to extinguish the flames of revolution of the people of the world. To oppose US imperialism today, it is imperative to oppose modern revisionism. No matter how the modern revisionism centered on the leadership group of the CPSU opposes China, opposes the people, opposes revolution, opposes national liberation movements, opposes Marxism-Leninism, and serves US imperialism, they can never save US imperialism from its doomed fate, and are destined to suffer a shameful and complete defeat.
    Nguyen Minh Phuong condemned the crimes of aggression committed by US imperialism in Vietnam. He said, "We will never be intimidated by violent actions. We resolutely refute the deceptive nonsense of US imperialism's so-called 'seeking peace.'" He said, "We, the youth and people of South Vietnam, will never retreat in the face of the enemy. Our only path is to advance bravely, strike hard and accurately against US imperialism, and contribute to the common struggle of the people and youth of the world."
    Sanna Mamadou Laminah said, "In this struggle against imperialism, we must arm ourselves with courage and a spirit of sacrifice. We are not afraid of the great power of imperialism. Chairman Mao Zedong said: 'The people, and not one or two new types of weapons, decide the outcome of war.' The Vietnamese people have proven this historic truth with the victory they have won in the struggle against the behemoth of the United States, which possesses enormous military power."
    Jaime González said that the current struggle of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to completely expel imperialism and eliminate colonial exploitation is developing vigorously. This struggle tells us that peaceful transition is impossible, and peaceful coexistence with the mortal enemy of the people of the world is also impossible. In short, the capitulationist theories of modern revisionists must never be accepted.
    Jaime González said, "As Chairman Mao Zedong has correctly pointed out: 'The people, and not one or two new types of weapons, decide the outcome of war.' Although US imperialism and other running dogs further use counter-revolutionary violence to suppress the just movements of the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to strive for liberation, although the revisionist traitor group headed by the CPSU leadership vigorously advocates their theories of peaceful coexistence with the enemy, and although they exhaust all kinds of tricks in an attempt to undermine the struggles of the people of all countries, seek alliance with US imperialism, and advocate a policy of cooperation with US imperialism. However, all the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are even more convinced that armed struggle is the only correct path, the path of opposing counter-revolutionary violence with revolutionary violence and carrying the people's war through to the end. This desire and this determination, whether now or in the future, will never be stopped by the dark forces of world counter-revolution headed by US imperialists and modern revisionists."
    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd—The All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation recently wrote to youth and student organizations in Asian, African, and Latin American countries on the occasion of "Anti-Colonialism Day" on April 24th, reiterating that Chinese youth and students will always support the struggles of the people, youth, and students of Asia, Africa, and Latin America against imperialism headed by the United States, new and old colonialism, and for national independence and national liberation.
    In their letter, the All-China Youth Federation and the All-China Students' Federation extended the highest fighting salute to the youth and students of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are fighting heroically against imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States, and striving for national independence, national liberation, and democratic freedom.

### 首都青年集会纪念反殖民主义日  各国代表谴责美帝侵略罪行，支持各国青年反帝斗争

    首都青年集会纪念反殖民主义日
    各国代表谴责美帝侵略罪行，支持各国青年反帝斗争
    据新华社二十四日讯　首都青年一千二百多人今天下午举行大会，纪念四月二十四日反殖民主义日。
    全国青联副主席钱大卫，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团副团长阮明芳，几内亚非洲民主革命青年组织代表萨纳·马马杜·拉米纳，哥伦比亚青年朋友海梅·冈萨雷斯，先后在大会上讲话。他们谴责了美帝国主义在世界各地的侵略罪行，表示支持越南人民的抗美救国斗争，支持世界各国人民和青年反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义的斗争。
    钱大卫在讲话中说，哪里有美帝国主义的侵略和压迫，哪里就有人民的反抗和斗争。越南人民和青年在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利再一次雄辩地证明，美帝国主义只不过是一只外强中干的纸老虎，人民战争是战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的最好的法宝。
    钱大卫谴责了以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义背叛全世界人民的利益，为美帝国主义效劳，破坏亚非拉人民反帝革命斗争。无数事实说明，以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义已成为美帝国主义的帮凶，扮演着企图扑灭世界人民革命烈火的“消防队”的角色。今天要反对美帝国主义就必须反对现代修正主义。不管以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义怎样反对中国、反对人民、反对革命、反对民族解放运动、反对马克思列宁主义，为美帝国主义效劳，他们决不能挽救美帝国主义的死亡命运，而且注定遭到可耻的彻底失败。
    阮明芳谴责了美帝国主义在越南的侵略罪行。他说，我们决不受暴力行动的恫吓。我们坚决驳斥美帝国主义所谓“寻求和平”的骗人鬼话。他说，我们越南南方青年和人民，永远不会在敌人的面前退缩。我们唯一的一条大道，那就是奋勇前进，对美帝国主义要打得狠、打得准，为世界人民和青年的共同斗争事业作出贡献。
    萨纳·马马杜·拉米纳说，在和帝国主义的这场斗争中，我们必须用勇敢和牺牲精神来武装自己，我们毫不畏惧帝国主义的强大力量。毛泽东主席说过：“决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”越南人民用他们在反击拥有巨大军事威力的美国这个庞然大物的斗争中所获得的胜利，证明了这个历史性的真理。
    海梅·冈萨雷斯说，当前亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民彻底驱逐帝国主义和消灭殖民主义剥削的斗争正蓬勃发展。这一斗争告诉我们，和平过渡是不可能的，同世界人民的死敌进行和平共处，也是不可能的。总之，绝不能接受现代修正主义者的投降理论。
    海梅·冈萨雷斯说，正如毛泽东主席所正确指出的：“决定战争胜败的是人民，而不是一两件新式武器。”尽管美帝国主义及其他走狗进一步使用反革命暴力来镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取解放的正义运动，尽管以苏共领导为首的修正主义叛徒集团大肆鼓吹他们同敌人和平共处的理论，尽管他们使尽各种花招，企图破坏各国人民的斗争，寻求同美帝国主义的联盟，鼓吹同美帝国主义的合作政策。但是，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的全体人民，却更加相信：武装斗争是唯一正确的道路，是以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力和把人民战争进行到底的道路。这种愿望和这种决心，不管是现在还是将来，绝不会被以美帝国主义者和现代修正主义者为首的世界反革命的黑暗势力所遏止。
    据新华社二十三日讯　中华全国青年联合会和中华全国学生联合会最近就四月二十四日“反殖民主义日”写信给亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国青年和学生组织，重申中国青年和学生将永远支持亚、非、拉人民和青年、学生反对以美国为首的帝国主义、新老殖民主义，以及争取民族独立和民族解放的斗争。
    全国青联、全国学联在信中向为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义，争取民族独立、民族解放和民主自由而英勇斗争的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国青年、学生致崇高的战斗的敬礼。
