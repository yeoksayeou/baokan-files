	Wu Han, this "historian," does not conduct research on history as "objectively" as he boasts. He distorts historical materials according to his subjective needs, using history for his own purposes to achieve his despicable anti-Party, anti-socialist goals. Wu Han's "using the past to serve the present" should be read as "using the past to serve himself." He is a thoroughgoing bourgeois pragmatist!

	The most obvious example is that in 1943, Wu Han used "Shuoshi" to curry favor with Chiang Kai-shek, recommending himself by discussing the ancient "shi" (scholars) and begging the Chiang gang for official titles. Similarly, the same book, *Ming Taizu*, underwent several changes due to Wu Han's different personal needs. In 1943, because Wu Han wanted to please Chiang Kai-shek, the book praised Zhu Yuanzhang, even beautifying Zhu Yuanzhang as a "great national hero." But in 1949, this book was slightly modified by Wu Han and became *Biography of Zhu Yuanzhang*, suddenly scolding Zhu Yuanzhang, claiming that it was to allude to Chiang Kai-shek, and so on. How disgusting! A "historian," history in his hands, actually became his political "stock." At his will, he transformed history as if by magic. Regardless of historical materialism, Wu Han only knew how to use history to serve his bourgeois individualism. He was originally a person who used history to make political deals, a bourgeois philistine.

	After liberation, his "character" did not change. Since 1959, he has continuously written about ancient figures such as Hai Rui and Lian Po, making veiled accusations, scolding the Party, scolding socialism, and speaking up for right-leaning opportunists who had been "removed" from their "commander" positions. In *Yu Qian, National Hero of the Ming Dynasty* (New Construction, No. 6, 1960), he blatantly used the name of researching Yu Qian to "vindicate," "commend," and appeal for right-leaning opportunists.

	In 1960, Wu Han particularly elevated Yu Qian, adding the title "Minister of Defense," exaggerating the merits of his leadership in the "Defense of Beijing," prominently depicting Yu Qian as "not avoiding suspicion and resentment, speaking his mind, hated by some who could not become high officials, and even more hated by some high officials whose roles were not as good as Yu Qian's." He lamented that Yu Qian was "removed from office," "removed from command," and killed by Emperor Yingzong, saying with ulterior motives, "The broad masses of people deeply mourned Yu Qian." He also borrowed the words of the eunuch Xing An, saying, "This man worries about the country day and night, without regard for family life. If he leaves, where can the court find such a person!" He even described how, after Yu Qian's death, the new emperor succeeded to the throne and apologized to Yu Qian's spirit in heaven: "When the country was in great difficulty, he protected the state and ensured its safety. Only Your Excellency was unique, and he was envied by treacherous officials. The late Emperor already knew that he was wronged, and I truly pity his loyalty." Wu Han finally shouted slogans: "The broad masses of people will forever commemorate this national hero who defended Beijing, forever immortal!"

	According to Wu Han's consistent logic of "using the past to serve himself" in his historical treatment of ancient figures, he brought out this "national hero" and shouted about Yu Qian being "wrongfully" "removed from office" and "removed from command," publicizing how the succeeding emperor later apologized to this "Minister of Defense" and made amends. We are fully justified in concluding that this was Wu Han's blatant appeal on behalf of the right-leaning opportunists who were "removed" from their "official" positions by the Party at that time!

	Looking at Wu Han's history of more than thirty years since he joined Hu Shih in 1930, it can be seen that under the careful guidance of Hu Shih, a running dog of American imperialism, he has developed a set of skills to use history to oppose the Communist Party, oppose the people, scold the Communist Party, scold socialism, and praise the American and Chiang masters. It should be said that Wu Han is a true disciple who inherited Hu Shih's mantle. He is not a "historian." Now it seems that isn't he more like a national traitor who betrays his ancestors and the thousands of years of glorious history of the Chinese nation - Hu Shih? What qualifications does he have to call himself a "historian"? He is just a philistine who distorts, tampers with, and utilizes history! Wu Han is so similar to the modern revisionists abroad in this respect. As is well known, haven't people like Khrushchev distorted and used history to carry out anti-Marxist activities? In today's extremely sharp class struggle at home and abroad, we must be highly vigilant against "historians" like Wu Han!

### 靠历史做政治交易的人

    靠历史做政治交易的人	严　平
    吴晗这位“历史学家”对历史可不象他自己吹嘘的那样，是“客观”地进行研究的。他凭自己主观的需要，篡改历史材料，使历史为他所用，以达到他卑劣的反党反社会主义的目的。吴晗的“古为今用”应读作“古为己用”，他是一个地道的资产阶级实用主义者！
    最明显的例子是，一九四三年吴晗用《说士》向蒋介石献媚，借说古代之“士”，毛遂自荐，向蒋帮乞求官爵。同样一部《明太祖》，就因吴晗的个人需要不同而几经变化。一九四三年，由于吴晗要讨好蒋介石，这本书就把朱元璋吹捧了一番，甚至把朱元璋美化成为一个“伟大的民族英雄”。可是到了一九四九年，这本书被吴晗略加改头换面，变成了《朱元璋传》，突然大骂起朱元璋来了，据他说这是为了影射蒋介石的，云云。这是多么令人恶心！一个“历史学家”，历史到了他的手中，竟然成了他的政治“股票”。随他之所欲，他象变魔术似地把历史变来变去。管你什么历史唯物主义，吴晗只知道利用历史为他的资产阶级个人主义服务。他原来是一个靠历史做政治交易的人，是一个资产阶级市侩。
    解放后，他的这种“品性”并没有改变。从一九五九年以来，他连续写海瑞、廉颇等古人，指桑骂槐，骂党，骂社会主义，为被“罢”了“帅”的右倾机会主义分子张目。在《明代民族英雄于谦》（一九六○年第六期《新建设》）中，他更明目张胆地借研究于谦之名，为右倾机会主义分子“辩冤”、“表功”和呼吁。
    在一九六○年，吴晗特别抬出了于谦这个人来，加注“国防部长”，夸他领导的“北京的保卫战”的功勋，突出地描绘于谦“不避嫌怨，有意见便说，有些作不了大官的人都恨他，有些大官作用比不上于谦的更恨他”。他感叹于谦之被“罢官”、“罢帅”并被英宗杀了，别有用心地说：“广大人民是深深悼念于谦的”。他又借太监兴安之口说：“这人日日夜夜为国家操心，不问家庭生活，他要去了，朝廷那儿能找得这样的人！”他甚至还描述于谦死后，新皇帝继位，如何向于谦在天之灵道歉：“当国家多难，保社稷以无虞，惟公之独特，为权奸所并嫉，先帝已知少枉，而朕心实怜其忠。”吴晗最后大声喊口号：“广大人民永远纪念这个保卫北京城的民族英雄，永垂不朽！”
    按照吴晗历史上一贯对待古人的“古为己用”的逻辑来看，他搬出这个“民族英雄”而大呼于谦被“罢官”、“罢帅”之“冤”，宣扬继位的皇帝后来如何向这个“国防部长”道歉赔不是，我们是完全有理由认定：这是吴晗露骨地替当时被党罢了“官”的右倾机会主义分子呼吁！
    综观吴晗自一九三○年来投靠胡适后的三十余年的历史，可以看出他在美帝国主义走狗胡适的精心教导下，练就了一套利用历史来反共，反人民，骂共产党，骂社会主义，吹捧美蒋主子的本领。应该说，吴晗是承受了胡适衣钵的真传弟子，他不是什么“历史学家”。现在看来，他不是更象出卖祖宗、叛变中华民族数千年光辉历史的民族罪人——胡适吗？他还有什么资格以“历史学家”自居呢？他只不过是一个歪曲、篡改、利用历史的市侩而已！吴晗在这一点上，又同国外的现代修正主义者多么相象。如众周知，赫鲁晓夫之流不正是歪曲利用历史进行反马克思主义的勾当吗？在国内外阶级斗争十分尖锐的今天，我们对于象吴晗这样的“历史学家”，的确是不能不提高警惕的！
