    Let Mao Zedong Thought Take Root in Workers' Minds
    Wang Jinsheng, Party Branch Secretary of the Casting Shop of the Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory

    Our work section is responsible for the cleaning and chipping of steel castings. In the past, it relied mainly on heavy manual labor, which was tiring, dirty, and hot. Many workers were not happy with the work and wanted to transfer to other types of jobs. Production often failed to meet targets. The fittings cast by the previous process piled up like mountains and could not be cleaned and delivered on time. The delivery work section became a "cannot deliver work" section.

    I used to be a worker in the delivery work section of the casting shop. In 1961, I became the Party Branch Secretary. In the beginning, I wanted to do a good job, but I didn't know where to focus my efforts. I was busy solving specific production problems, chasing plans, running for fittings, and mediating worker disputes all day long. I was exhausted, but the problems kept piling up. Later, after studying Chairman Mao's works, I found some clues and realized that the most fundamental thing for a Party Branch Secretary is to master Mao Zedong Thought and let it take root in the work section and in the minds of the workers.

    After several years of work, the situation in the work section has changed, the mental outlook of the people has changed, and the production outlook has also changed. We have carried out technical revolution, and efficiency has increased year by year, and the number of personnel has decreased year by year. The entire work section has been streamlined from more than 230 people to the current 32 people. In 1963, it was named an advanced collective in Beijing, and in 1964, it was named a "Five-Good" work section of the factory.

    Winning People's Hearts is Key
    In the beginning, when I grasped ideological work, I often dealt with things as they were, without getting to the root of the problem. I also lacked deep class feelings for the workers. I always thought, "I am here to help you." My work methods were simple and crude, and I lacked patience, so the effect was not great. Later, in the practice of branch work, I slowly realized that ideological work must be done with class feelings. Winning people's hearts is key, and winning hearts requires enthusiasm. Only in this way can the team be led well.

    We have an old worker in our work section named He Chunhai, who used to think more about personal interests. At first, I felt uncomfortable when I saw him. Once, I talked to him and said bluntly, "Old He! Your shortcomings are quite serious. If you continue like this, you will make big mistakes." He asked back, "What's wrong with me?" When I heard this, I got angry. I thought to myself, you have shortcomings and you pretend not to know. Okay! I listed his problems one by one. I felt comfortable, but Old He left before I finished speaking. In this way, not only did I not help him, but I alienated him even more.

    Was it my fault or his? I tossed and turned for a long time. Where was the problem? After studying Chairman Mao's articles such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "Serve the People," and "In Memory of Norman Bethune," I realized that I had not treated comrades with the same enthusiasm as the Party and Chairman Mao taught. In my eyes, I only saw Old He's shortcomings and could not see his advantages at all. Old He came from a very poor background. He followed his father pulling carts and selling vegetables when he was eight years old and suffered all kinds of exploitation and oppression. He had deep hatred for the old society and was grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of his heart. Others were not happy working in the casting shop, but Old He was not afraid of dirt or fatigue and has been working here with peace of mind. How could he be convinced if I only told him a bunch of shortcomings? I thought it over and over again and finally understood. I took the initiative to go to Old He's house and apologized to him. He was very moved after listening. We chatted together, from life to work, and then talked about the things before liberation.

    I told him about the third day of the third lunar month in 1948 that I will never forget: "On the ninth day of the third lunar month in 1948, the Kuomintang reactionaries suddenly broke into my house and said that we were colluding with the Eighth Route Army. They tied up my father, brother, and me. My little sister was kicked to death by them. We were beaten to death. After ten days we escaped from the tiger’s mouth…”. Seeing me talk about the suffering of the old society, he continued, "We both grew up in bitter water. One year during the Spring Festival, my family had no food. My father went out to find work to earn some money for the New Year. Not only did he not earn any money, but he was beaten up. My mother was so upset that she committed suicide by poisoning herself." Speaking of this, Old He cried sadly. After talking about it, we were both bitter gourds on the same vine, and class feelings melted our hearts together. The more we talked, the closer our hearts became. I seized this opportunity to enlighten his class consciousness and said to him, "This is all caused by the evil old society. Now, we are liberated, but there are still two-thirds of the people in the world who have not been liberated. We must never forget the bitterness of the class. We must be good masters of our own affairs and not only care about ourselves. We must follow Chairman Mao and work hard."

    After that, he often came to my house, and we studied Chairman Mao's works together. Old He's thinking slowly changed. He said, "We must hate our shortcomings as much as we hate the old society, listen to Chairman Mao, and serve the people wholeheartedly." With the help of the Party organization and comrades, He Chunhai made rapid progress, rushed to do heavy work, and took the initiative to care for others. He served as the production team leader and changed the "first prize" that others had awarded him to "third prize" several times, which was praised by the comrades in the team. Everyone said, "Old He has become Old Third-Prize." Later, Old He was named a "Five-Good" employee of the factory and gloriously joined the Party in 1964.

    A knife will rust if it is not sharpened, and people's thoughts will fall behind if they are not improved. Old He has made rapid progress in the past few years. We often praise him. Gradually, he became a little arrogant. He was a production team leader, and he did not pay attention to giving play to everyone's role in the team. He was more subjective in his work, which made the comrades in the team not very united. After discovering this situation, I talked to He Chunhai and suggested that he study "Methods of Work of Party Committees" carefully. After a few days of study, his thinking improved. Once, he said to me happily, "I have found the problem this time. That is, I didn't put the 'squad leader' and the masses in the right place. In the past, I always thought that what I said was right, and I didn't give play to everyone's role. I rarely consulted with others and handled things subjectively. Chairman Mao said, 'Guard against arrogance. This is a matter of principle for leaders and an important condition for maintaining unity.' I will definitely correct this in the future." Later, he made a review to the comrades in the team, and everyone further helped him analyze and improve. Now, Old He discusses things with everyone and pays attention to listening to everyone's opinions, and the team's work has made progress again.

    In the past few years, we have always paid attention to grasping class education, carrying out "Two Remembrances" (remembering the bitterness of the old society and remembering the Party's care in the new society) and "Three Helps" (helping those who forget their roots turn back, helping young people become familiar with the factory history and the family history of veteran workers, and helping people from exploiting families draw a clear line with the class). We talk about class and class struggle a lot, often talk about it, talk about it everywhere, talk about it in the factory, talk about it at home, and fundamentally improve people's class consciousness and promote the revolutionization of the workforce.

    To Redden Others, One Must First Redden Oneself
    Several years of practical experience in branch work have made me deeply realize that to let Mao Zedong Thought take root in the minds of workers, we must first let Mao Zedong Thought take root in the mind of me, the branch secretary. To correct others, one must first correct oneself, to redden others, one must first redden oneself. Only in this way can the team be led well.

    Although I came from a very bitter background and have been a worker for so many years, receiving a lot of training and education from the Party, I am still influenced by a lot of bourgeois ideas. In 1961, after achieving some success in my work, I had the idea of comparing my treatment with that of other comrades. I felt that being a worker was better than being a cadre, and I still had extra bonuses every month. In particular, I felt that my work was very hard. After work, I had to do ideological work, and I often didn't get home until very late. When I got home, my lover also complained, saying:
  “Others can go home on time, but you don’t earn much money, but you manage a lot!” My ideological struggle was very fierce. I thought, if I keep working like this, when will it end!

    Once, I talked to the leaders of the workshop and revealed this emotion. At that time, the leaders of the workshop criticized me and said, "Being a revolutionary cadre is not for personal gain, but to endure hardship first and enjoy happiness later." Although there were not many words, they made my mind clearer. Then, I studied articles such as "Serve the People," "In Memory of Norman Bethune," and "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains." Norman Bethune had no selfish intentions, but I considered myself too much. In contrast, I shouldn't have done that. If the revolutionary martyrs were all afraid of sacrifice, there would be no today. Now it is a peaceful environment, and the possibility of sacrificing life is relatively small, but to do a good job in revolutionary work, personal interests should be placed behind the interests of the revolution, and work should be done without compensation.

    Through this ideological struggle, I realized that to do a good job in revolutionary work, a Communist Party member must first have a spirit of self-sacrifice. This is a standard for testing one's loyalty to the Party. From then on, I had enough enthusiasm for work. In the past few years, I have often used Mao Zedong Thought to compare myself, carry out ideological struggles, and constantly transform my non-proletarian ideas.

    To transform one's own thinking, in addition to regularly studying Chairman Mao's works and comparing and checking oneself, it is also necessary to participate in labor frequently, integrate with the masses, and accept criticism and supervision from the masses. At the same time, only when the masses do not treat you as an outsider can you do a good job in ideological work. After I became a cadre, I participated in less labor for a while, and my words were also "I speak, you listen." An old worker bluntly reminded me, "Xiao Wang, if you don't work often after becoming a cadre, you will be separated from the masses!" This opinion sounded the alarm for me. With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's "On Practice" and the central government's instructions on cadres participating in labor, and I understood that cadres must participate in labor, stand among the masses, and not be separated from the masses for a moment. I reviewed my thinking at the team meeting. From then on, I insisted on participating in labor frequently. Workers were willing to talk to me, I also had more experience of the suffering of the workers, and I was able to discover and solve the ideological trends of the masses in a timely manner.

    The above is some of my experience in doing ideological work in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings. I am still far from the requirements of the Party, and I will definitely work harder in the future, study modestly, complete the tasks assigned by the Party better, lead the team better, and transform myself better.

### 让毛泽东思想在工人头脑里扎根

    让毛泽东思想在工人头脑里扎根
    长辛店机车车辆工厂铸工车间交活工段党支部书记　王金生
    我们工段负责铸钢件的清铲工作，过去主要靠笨重体力劳动，又累、又脏、又烤，不少的工人不安心工作，想转别的工种。生产上常常完不成任务。上道工序铸出的配件堆成了山，不能及时清铲交活，交活工段成了“交不出活”的工段。
    我原来是铸工车间交活工段的工人，一九六一年当了党支部书记。开始的时候，我想把工作做好，但是不知道往哪儿使劲。整天忙着解决生产中的具体问题，追计划、跑配件，工人吵架，就去说和说和，累得头昏脑胀，问题还是越积越多。后来，学习了毛主席著作，摸到了一些门路，懂得了当一个党支部书记，最根本的一条，就是把毛泽东思想学到手，让毛泽东思想在工段当家，在工人头脑里扎根。
    经过几年的工作，工段的情况不同了，人的精神面貌变了，生产面貌也变了，开展了技术革命，效率一年比一年提高，人员一年比一年减少。全工段由原来的二百三十多人精简到现在的三十二人。一九六三年被评为北京市的先进集体，一九六四年又被评为工厂的“五好”工段。
    带人要带心
    开始，我抓思想工作，往往就事论事，抓不到根儿上，对工人也缺乏深厚的阶级感情。总认为：“我是来帮助你的。”工作方法简单生硬，不耐心，效果不大。后来，在支部工作的实践中，我才慢慢地体会到，要带着阶级感情来做思想工作。带人要带心，带心要热心。只有这样，才能把队伍带好。
    我们工段有个老工人叫何春海，过去，对个人利益的事儿考虑比较多。起初，我一见他心里就不痛快。有一次我找他谈话，劈头盖脑地说：“老何！你的缺点可够呛了，再这样下去要犯大错误。”他反问：“我怎么了？”我一听，就火了。心想，你有缺点还装不知道，好！我就把他的毛病一五一十的数落了一大顿。我心里倒是痛快了，可是老何没听完就走了。这样一来，不但没有帮成，反而更疏远了。
    这事儿，怨我，还是怨他？我在脑子里反来复去折腾了好长时间。问题在那里？学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》等文章，我认识到自己没有象党和毛主席教导的那样，满腔热情地对待同志。在我的眼睛里，看到的净是老何的缺点，对他的优点，一点也看不见。老何出身很苦，八岁就跟着父亲拉车卖菜，受尽了剥削和压迫，对旧社会有深仇大恨，对党和毛主席打心眼里感激。别人不安心在铸工车间工作，老何却不怕脏，不怕累，一直在这里安心干。我光说人家一大堆缺点，他怎么会服气呢？我想来想去，终于想通了，就主动到老何家里去，向他做了检讨，他听了以后，很感动。我们聊在一起了，从生活到工作，又谈到解放前的事儿。
    我给他说了我一辈子忘不了的三月初九：“那是一九四八年旧历三月初九，国民党反动派突然闯入我家，说我们私通八路，把父亲、弟弟和我都绑走了，小妹妹被他们一脚踢死，我们被打得死去活来，十几天才逃出虎口……”。他见我说起旧社会的苦，也接着说：“咱们都是苦水里长大的，有一年春节，我家里没有粮食，父亲出去找活，想挣几个钱过年。不但没挣到钱，反而挨了一顿打，母亲心一窄，就服毒自杀了。”说到这里，老何伤心地哭了。说来说去，原来我俩都是一个藤上的苦瓜，阶级感情把我们的心熔化在一起了。我俩越谈，心越贴得紧。我抓住这个机会，启发他的阶级觉悟，对他说：“这都是万恶的旧社会造成的，现在，我们解放了，可是，世界上还有三分之二的人民没有解放。我们要永远不忘阶级苦。要当好家，做好主，不能只顾自己，咱们要跟着毛主席好好干。”
    以后，他常到我家里来，我们一起学习毛主席著作。老何的思想慢慢地转变了，他表示：“要象恨旧社会那样，恨自己的缺点，听毛主席的话，全心全意为人民服务。”在党组织和同志们帮助下，何春海进步很快，抢重活干，主动关心别人。他担任生产小组长，几次把别人评他的“一等奖”改为“三等”，受到小组同志的赞扬，大家说：“老何变成了老三等。”后来，老何被评为厂里的“五好”职工，一九六四年光荣地入了党。
    刀不磨会生锈，人的思想不提高会落后。老何这几年进步很快。我们经常表扬他，慢慢地，他有点骄傲了。他是个生产组长，在组内不注意发挥大家的作用，做事比较主观，使得小组内的同志不太团结。发现了这个情况以后，我就找何春海谈，建议他好好学习一下《党委会的工作方法》。他经过几天学习，思想提高了。有一次，他很高兴地对我说：“这回我把毛病找到了。就是我这‘班长’和群众的位置没摆好。过去我老认为我说得对，没发挥大家的作用，遇到事情和别人很少商量，就主观地处理了。毛主席讲，‘力戒骄傲。这对领导者是一个原则问题，也是保持团结的一个重要条件。’我今后一定改正。”后来，他向小组的同志作了检查，大家又进一步帮助他分析提高。现在，老何有事就和大家商量，注意听取大家意见，小组工作又有了进步。
    几年来，我们一直注意抓阶级教育，开展“两忆”（忆旧社会苦，忆新社会党的关怀）、“三帮”（帮助忘本的人回头，帮助青年熟悉厂史和老工人家史，帮助剥削家庭出身的人划清阶级界限）的活动。大讲阶级和阶级斗争，经常讲，到处讲，工厂讲，家里讲，从根本上提高人的阶级觉悟，促进职工队伍的革命化。
    人红己先红
    几年来的支部工作实践，使我深深体会到，要让毛泽东思想在工人头脑里扎根，必须首先让毛泽东思想在我这个支部书记的头脑里扎根。正人先正己，人红己先红。只有这样，才能把队伍带好。
    我虽然出身很苦，当了这么多年的工人，受到了党的不少培养和教育，但是，仍然有不少的资产阶级思想影响。一九六一年，工作上取得了一点成绩，就有了和其他同志比待遇的想法，觉得当工人也比当干部强，每月还有超额奖。特别是觉得自己工作很辛苦，下了班还要做思想工作，经常很晚才回家。回到家里，爱人也埋怨，说：
  “人家到点都能回家，你挣钱不多，管事倒不少！”我的思想斗争得很厉害，心想，这样干下去，什么时候是个头啊！
    有一次，我和车间领导上谈话，流露了这种情绪。当时，车间领导上就批评了我，说：“当革命干部不能为个人，就是要吃苦在前，享乐在后。”虽然话不多，却使我头脑清醒了一些。接着，我又学习了《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》等文章。白求恩毫无自私自利之心，我却过多地考虑自己。对照一下，我太不应该了。如果革命先烈都怕牺牲，那还有今天。现在是和平环境，牺牲生命的可能性比较少了，但是，要做好革命工作，应当把个人利益放在革命利益的后头，不计报酬地工作。
    通过这番思想斗争，我认识到，一个共产党员要做好革命工作，首先得有自我牺牲的精神，这是考验自己对党忠诚的标准，从这以后。工作劲头足了。几年来，我经常用毛主席思想对照自己，开展思想斗争，不断地改造自己的非无产阶级思想。
    要改造自己的思想，除了经常学习毛主席著作，对照检查自己外，还要经常参加劳动，和群众打成一片，接受群众的批评和监督。同时，只有群众不把你当外人，才能做好思想工作。我当了干部以后，有一段时间参加劳动少了，说话也是“我讲，你听”。有个老工人直截了当的提醒我说：“小王，当了干部不经常干活，就要脱离群众了！”这个意见给我敲了警钟。我带着这个问题，学习了毛主席的《实践论》和中央有关干部参加劳动的指示，懂得了干部一定要参加劳动，要站在群众之中，一刻也不能脱离群众。我在小组会上检查了自己的思想。从这以后，我就坚持经常参加劳动，工人有话愿意跟我讲，对工人的疾苦也体会多了，群众的思想苗头也能够及时发现和解决了。
    以上，就是我遵照毛主席的教导，做思想工作的一些体会。我现在距离党的要求还差得很远，今后一定加倍努力，虚心学习，把党交给的任务完成得更好，把队伍带得更好，把自己改造得更好。
