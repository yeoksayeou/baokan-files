    Comrade Mao Zedong said: “The Chinese people have the ambition and the ability to catch up with and surpass the advanced world levels in the not too distant future.” This ambition can be said to be the ambition to compete with the strongest, and this ability can be said to be the ability to compete with the strongest. Isn't the advanced world level the strongest? Our determination to catch up with and surpass it, isn't that daring to compete with the strongest?
    The Shanghai Weihai Iron Factory is a typical example of daring to compete with the strongest. This "big blacksmith shop," which originally relied primarily on manual operations, has, after nine years of arduous struggle, actually caught up with the most modern Changchun Automobile Factory in the country in terms of product quality. What an ambition, what an ability!
    The Weihai Iron Factory not only dares to compete with the strongest in the country but also dares to compete with the strongest in the world. After catching up with the advanced levels in the country, it is continuing to strive to catch up with and surpass the advanced world levels. Again, what an ambition, what an ability!
    The small Weihai Iron Factory can be regarded as an image of our great country. Nine years ago, wasn't it also a "poor and blank" "weakling"? However, because it dares to compete with the strongest in the country and is good at competing with the strongest in the country, it has now become the strongest in our country in the production of steel plate springs. As long as our entire country dares to compete with the strongest and is good at competing with the strongest, can't we also completely change the "poor and blank" "weakling" appearance and catch up with and surpass the advanced world levels?
    Competing with the strongest is a combat instinct and a great mission historically bestowed upon the proletariat. The proletariat wants to overthrow the powerful rule of the bourgeoisie, to build a powerful socialist country, and to realize communism, which is even more advanced than socialism. Without the revolutionary spirit and fighting spirit to compete with the strongest, it is impossible to complete such a historical task.
    The general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism is also the spirit of daring to compete with the strongest. Striving for the upper reaches means striving to be the strongest. If you don't dare to compete with the strongest, how can you strive for the upper reaches?
    The national construction policy of self-reliance, striving for prosperity, hard struggle, and building the country with diligence and thrift is also the policy of daring to compete with the strongest. Striving for prosperity means becoming the strongest. If you don't dare to compete with the strongest, what is there to talk about striving for prosperity?
    We advocate learning from Daqing, catching up with Daqing, and surpassing Daqing, which is also advocating competing with the strongest. Daqing is a model of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism; it is the strongest in these areas. If we don't dare to compete with this strongest, it can be asserted that we will not be able to learn well, catch up, or surpass.
    Daring to compete with the strongest means not taking the old road of others but creating our own new road. This is true when competing with the advanced levels of foreign countries, and it is also true when competing with the advanced levels in the country. When the Weihai Iron Factory copied the technology of the Changchun Automobile Factory, it could not catch up with the Changchun Automobile Factory; when it created its own technology, it caught up with the Changchun Automobile Factory. The reason lies here.
    Daring to compete with the strongest also means daring to demand high standards of ourselves. Although we may be far from high standards, we are not "daunted by difficulties," but rather "inspired by difficulties." Others are so high, why can't we muster our strength and climb up? Therefore, daring to compete with the strongest is both a pressure and a driving force. With this driving force, we can become powerful, we can strive for the upper reaches, and we can become the strongest.
    To dare to compete with the strongest, we must also be good at competing with the strongest. With the revolutionary spirit of daring to compete, we must also have a scientific attitude of being good at competing. Only in this way can we transform the revolutionary ambition of competing with the strongest into the revolutionary ability of competing with the strongest. Only in this way can we transform the subjective desire to be the strongest into the objective fact of being the strongest. The great achievement of the Weihai Iron Factory is precisely the result of the combination of daring to compete and being good at competing, and the combination of revolutionary spirit and scientific attitude.
    In learning from the Weihai Iron Factory, we should learn this point from it.

### 敢同最强者较量

    敢同最强者较量
    毛泽东同志说：“中国人民有志气，有能力，一定要在不远的将来，赶上和超过世界先进水平。”这志气，可以说是同最强者较量的志气，这能力，可以说是同最强者较量的能力。世界先进水平，不就是最强者吗？我们决心要赶上和超过它，不就是敢同最强者较量吗？
    上海卫海铁工厂就是敢同最强者较量的一个典型。这个原来基本上用手工操作的“大打铁铺”，经过九年的艰苦奋斗，居然在产品质量方面赶上了国内最现代化的长春汽车厂，这是何等的志气，何等的能力！
    卫海铁工厂不但敢同国内最强者较量，而且敢同世界最强者较量。它在赶上国内先进水平之后，正在为赶上和超过世界先进水平继续奋斗，这又是何等的志气，何等的能力！
    小小的卫海铁工厂，可以被看作是我们伟大国家的形象。九年之前，它不也是“一穷二白”的“弱者”吗？可是，由于它敢于同国内最强者较量，善于同国内最强者较量，现在也成了我国钢板弹簧生产的最强者。我们整个国家只要敢于同最强者较量，而且善于同最强者较量，不也一定能够彻底改变“一穷二白”的“弱者”面貌，赶上和超过世界先进水平吗？
    同最强者较量，这是历史赋予无产阶级的战斗本能和伟大使命。无产阶级要推翻强大的资产阶级统治，要建设强大的社会主义国家，要实现比社会主义还要高级的共产主义，没有同最强者较量的革命气魄和战斗精神，是不可能完成这样的历史任务的。
    鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线精神，也就是敢同最强者较量的精神。争上游就是争做最强者，如果不敢同最强者较量，凭什么力争上游呢？
    自力更生，奋发图强，艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国的建国方针，也就是敢同最强者较量的方针。图强就是做个最强者。如果不敢同最强者较量，谈什么奋发图强呢？
    我们提倡学大庆，赶大庆，超大庆，也就是提倡同最强者较量。大庆是鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的典范，是这些方面的最强者。如果我们不敢同这个最强者较量，可以断言，是学不好，赶不上，超不过的。
    敢同最强者较量，就不能走别人的老路，而要创自己的新路。同国外的先进水平较量是如此，同国内的先进水平较量也是如此。卫海铁工厂，当它照搬长春汽车厂的技术的时候，就赶不上长春汽车厂；当它独创自己的技术的时候，就赶上了长春汽车厂。道理就在这里。
    敢同最强者较量，也就敢用高标准要求自己，虽然自己离高标准可能很远，但不是“望而生畏”，而是“望而生劲”，别人那样高，自己为什么不可以鼓一把劲攀上去呢？因此，敢同最强者较量，一方面是一种压力，另一方面又是一种动力。有了这种动力，就能变得有力，就能力争上游，就有可能成为最强者。
    要敢同最强者较量，还要善同最强者较量。有了敢较量的革命精神，还要有善较量的科学态度。这样才有可能把同最强者较量的革命志气，变成同最强者较量的革命能力。才有可能把做最强者的主观愿望，变成最强者的客观事实。卫海铁工厂的巨大成就，正是敢较量和善较量相结合的结果，革命精神和科学态度相结合的结果。
    学习卫海铁工厂，就应当学习它的这一点。
