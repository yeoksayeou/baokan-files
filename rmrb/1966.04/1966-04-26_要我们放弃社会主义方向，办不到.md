    Comrade Wu Han wrote a lot of historical essays. From great generals and prime ministers to small state and county officials, he never let go of any historical figure that could be used to expound on a theme. Comrade Wu Han, who has always advertised respect for historical materials, even used the story of Ma Su from *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* as a historical fact by any means. However, since writing about Yu Qian, Comrade Wu Han's interest suddenly shifted from "incorruptible officials" to "good generals." In March 1962, he published "Zhao Kuo and Ma Su," saying that the Zhao state was defeated by Qin because it recalled Lian Po, who was "rich in military experience," from the front line and replaced him with Zhao Kuo, a "subjectivist" and "doctrinaire," as commander. He wanted people to relive the "lessons of subjectivism" and "doctrinairism" that "harm people, harm themselves, and ruin the country." In June of the same year, he published "The Fate of the Family of the Singer of the *Song of Chile*," praising the military aristocrat Hulü Jin, who rose to prominence by suppressing uprisings of various ethnic groups, as being "naturally straightforward" and "good at using troops." His son, Hulü Guang, was "naturally cautious and upright," but was killed because he offended the "昏庸无能的皇帝昏庸无能的皇帝昏庸无能的皇帝昏庸无能的皇帝昏庸无能的皇帝" and was framed by "villains." Who were Comrade Wu Han's articles aimed at? We know that modern revisionists and domestic right-leaning opportunists have always used the excuse of opposing "doctrinairism" to oppose Marxism, to oppose the Chinese Communist Party that adheres to Marxism. It is clear who Comrade Wu Han is referring to here. Comrade Wu Han used insinuation to slander our Party and the socialist system, and also attempted to intimidate our Party, wanting the Party to accept "lessons," abandon Marxist-Leninist principles, and abandon the socialist direction. This is precisely using the means of "cold sarcasm, hinting at one thing while talking about another, hidden and circuitous" mentioned by Comrade Wu Han in another article published at the same time, "Write More Essays," and is "不妨狠一些，越狠越好无妨狠一些，越狠越好无妨狠一些，越狠越好无妨狠一些，越狠越好无妨狠一些，越狠越好无妨狠一些，越狠越好." And towards the so-called "persecuted," he showed unlimited sympathy. This is precisely sympathy for the right-leaning opportunists who have been completely abandoned by the people in the actual struggle and who are completely hopeless of making a comeback.

    要我们放弃社会主义方向，办不到
                冯君实
    吴晗同志大写历史小品，从大将军、宰相到小州县官，凡历史人物身上有一点可以利用来借题发挥的，绝不放过。一向标榜尊重史料的吴晗同志，竟不择手段把《三国演义》中关于马谡的事也当史实来用。不过从写于谦以后，吴晗同志兴趣忽然从“清官”转到“良将”身上。一九六二年三月，发表《赵括和马谡》，说赵国因为把“富有军事经验”的廉颇从前线召回，换上“主观主义”、“教条主义”的赵括为帅，结果被秦打败。要人们重温“主观主义”、“教条主义”“害人、害己、误国的教训”。同年六月发表《〈敕勒歌〉歌唱者家族的命运》，颂扬一个镇压各族起义起家的军事贵族斛律金“生性质直”，“善于用兵”。他儿子斛律光“生性谨慎梗直”，由于触犯了“昏庸无能的皇帝”和遭到“小人”的陷害而被杀害。吴晗同志这些文章是针对谁呢？我们知道，现代修正主义分子和国内右倾机会主义分子，从来都是借口反对“教条主义”来反对马克思主义、反对坚持马克思主义的中国共产党，吴晗同志这里所指的是谁也就很清楚了。吴晗同志用含沙射影的手段，诬蔑我们的党和社会主义制度，又企图吓唬我们党，要党接受“教训”，放弃马克思列宁主义原则，放弃社会主义方向，正是使用了吴晗同志在同时发表的另一篇文章《多写一点杂文》中所说的“冷嘲热讽，指桑骂槐，隐蔽曲折”的手段，是“无妨狠一些，越狠越好”。而对于所谓被“迫害”者，寄予了无限同情，这正是对于在现实斗争中彻底被人民唾弃，对于卷土重来完全绝望的右倾机会主义分子的同情。
