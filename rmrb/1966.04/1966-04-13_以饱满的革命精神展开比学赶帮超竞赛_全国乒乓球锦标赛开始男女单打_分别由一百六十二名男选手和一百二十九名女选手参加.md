    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 12th. After a day of rest, players from all over the country participating in the 1966 National Table Tennis Championships today, with a full revolutionary spirit, began a fervent competition of learning from, catching up with, helping, and surpassing each other in the men's and women's singles events.

    In the first three rounds of the men's and women's singles matches today, the "little tiger" style of the rising stars from various regions, who are not afraid of strong opponents and dare to fight hard, and the ability of veteran masters to remain calm in the face of danger and finally reverse the situation, both left a deep impression on the audience.

    Lin Huiqing of Shanghai, last year's national women's singles champion, and Li Henan of Shanghai, the runner-up, faced a strong "impact" in the second round of the women's singles (both had a bye in the first round). When Xu Yali, a 23-year-old from the Liaoning team who is good at looping, played against the number one seed, Lin Huiqing, she won the first game 21-18; she then won the fourth game 21-17. When Chu Anna, a 15-year-old newcomer from the Liaoning team, played against the seed player Li Henan, she also used fierce smashes to win the first game 21-14, and once led 17-13 in the third game. The experienced Lin Huiqing and Li Henan later changed their tactics and strengthened their offensive, finally winning 3-2 and 3-1 respectively. After the match, both Lin Huiqing and Li Henan praised their opponents for playing well. Xu Yali and Chu Anna also said happily: Through the match with the famous players, they found the gap, and they will work hard to improve when they return.

    A total of 162 male players and 129 female players participated in the men's and women's singles events respectively. After more than 200 elimination matches in the morning, afternoon, and evening sessions, only 32 winners remained in both the men's and women's events.

    Among the eight "seed" players in the men's event, He Zubin, last year's national runner-up and a "seed" player (bye in the first round), was eliminated by Li Deyang of Liaoning, who is good at looping, 3-1 in the second round. Li Deyang then won 3-2 against Diao Wenyuan of Anhui, who is also good at looping, thus entering the top 32. Tomorrow, he will play against Cai Yandong of Beijing in the fourth round. Yu Yize of Shanghai, a "seed" player, played very hard, battling with Yang Zhansheng of Guangdong for five games in the second round, and then with Luo Wuhan, a newcomer from Liaoning, for four games in the third round before winning. He will meet Li Jingguang of Hebei in the fourth round. Zhuang Zedong of Beijing, the number one "seed," Li Furong of Shanghai, the number two "seed," Zhang Xielin of Shanghai, the number three "seed," and Zhou Lansun of Shanxi, the number four "seed," all successfully passed the second and third rounds with an advantage of 3-0. In the fourth round, they will play against Jiang Guangliu of Anhui, Chen Baoqing of Jiangsu, Sun Kecheng of Heilongjiang, and Tang Gaolin of Sichuan respectively. The other two "seed" players, Wang Jiasheng of Guizhou and Zhou Qian of Jiangsu, lost one game and two games respectively in the second and third rounds. In the fourth round, they will meet Xu Shaofa of Jilin and Yao Zhenxu of Shanghai.

    Among the eight (seed) players in the women's event, Hu Yulan of Liaoning (bye in the first round) was also eliminated by Lin Ximeng, a famous player from Fujian, 3-0 in the second round. Lin Ximeng then won 3-0 against Yu Chunxia of Hubei in the third round, and she will play against Shi Fengling of Beijing in the fourth round tomorrow. The opponents that the other seven "seed" players will meet in the fourth round are: Lin Huiqing, the number one "seed," against Ye Fenglian of Guangdong; Zheng Minzhi of Shanghai, the number two "seed," against Yu Meili of Shandong; Li Li of Beijing, the number three "seed," against Li Yuanzhao of Hubei; Liang Lizhen of Guangdong, the number four "seed," against Zhou Yiling of Shanghai; Li Henan against Liang Guangmei of Shandong; Di Qianghua of Jiangsu against Sheng Xinhua of Zhejiang; and Zheng Yushan of Guangdong against Wang Lianfang of Shanghai. Li Li played all five games in the second round with Hu Xincheng, an attacker from Shanghai, before winning 3-2. Di Qianghua lost one game in the third round when competing with Chen Lifang, a chopper from Hubei.

    Taking advantage of the rest opportunity on the 11th, the table tennis teams from various regions generally summarized the situation of participating in the team competition in the previous stage, improved their understanding, and were determined to make further efforts, continue to highlight politics in the five individual events, play with style, and play at a high level, so that both ideology and technology can achieve a bumper harvest. Many athletes, although they are not familiar with each other, took the initiative to practice together on the practice field today, pondering their skills and enthusiastically exchanging their experiences. Many athletes, although they were eliminated in the competition, also sat attentively in the stands to watch the matches of other players and humbly learned.

    Both the men's and women's singles events will be held for eight rounds of elimination matches, and the fourth and fifth rounds will be held on the 13th. (Attached picture)

    以饱满的革命精神展开比学赶帮超竞赛
    全国乒乓球锦标赛开始男女单打
    分别由一百六十二名男选手和一百二十九名女选手参加
    新华社上海十二日电　参加一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛的各地选手经过一天休息，今天又以饱满的革命精神开始在男、女单打中展开比学赶帮超的热烈竞赛。
    在今天的男、女单打头三轮比赛中，各地后起之秀不畏强手，敢打敢拼的“小老虎”风格和老将名手临危不乱，终于扭转局势的本领，都给观众留下了深刻的印象。
    去年女子单打全国冠军、上海的林慧卿和亚军、上海的李赫男，在女子单打的第二轮（她俩第一轮轮空）就受到了强有力的“冲击”。辽宁队善于拉弧圈球的二十三岁的徐雅丽同第一号“种子”林慧卿交战时，第一局就以二十一比十八获胜；以后又以二十一比十七赢了第四局。辽宁队十五岁的新手褚安娜同“种子”选手李赫男对垒时，也用猛烈的扣杀以二十一比十四赢了第一局，并且在第三局一度以十七比十三领先。有经验的林慧卿和李赫男后来改变战术，加强了攻势，才分别以三比二和三比一获胜。比赛结束后，林慧卿和李赫男都赞扬自己的对手打得好。徐雅丽和褚安娜也高兴地说：通过同名手的比赛，找到了差距，回去后要好好地锻炼。
    男、女单打分别由一百六十二名男选手和一百二十九名女选手参加。经过上午、下午和晚上的三轮二百多场淘汰赛，男、女选手都只剩下三十二名优胜者。
    男子的八名“种子”选手中，去年全国亚军、“种子”选手何祖斌（第一轮轮空）在第二轮就被辽宁善于拉弧圈球的李德洋以三比一所淘汰。李德洋接着又以三比二赢了安徽擅长拉弧圈球的刁文元，从而进入前三十二名，明天他将在第四轮中同北京的蔡延东交战，“种子”选手、上海的于贻泽打得很艰苦，第二轮同广东的杨湛盛激战了五局，第三轮又同辽宁新手罗武汉打了四局才获胜。他将在第四轮同河北的李景光相遇。第一号“种子”、北京的庄则栋，第二号“种子”、上海的李富荣，第三号“种子”、上海的张燮林，第四号“种子”、山西的周兰荪都以三比○的优势顺利通过第二和第三轮的比赛，他们在第四轮将分别同安徽的蒋光骝、江苏陈宝庆、黑龙江的孙克诚、四川的唐高林对垒。其他两个“种子”选手——贵州的王家声和江苏的周前，在第二、三轮比赛分别输了一局和两局，他们将在第四轮遇到吉林的许绍发和上海的姚振绪。
    女子的八名（种子）选手中，辽宁的胡玉兰（第一轮轮空）也在第二轮被福建名手林希孟以三比○所淘汰。林希孟在第三轮又以三比○赢了湖北的余春霞，她将在明天的第四轮中同北京的石凤玲交手。其他七名“种子”选手将在第四轮遇到的对手是：第一号“种子”林慧卿对广东的叶凤莲，第二号“种子”、上海的郑敏之对山东的于美丽，第三号“种子”、北京的李莉对湖北的李远照，第四号“种子”、广东的梁丽珍对上海的周一玲，李赫男对山东的梁广梅，江苏的狄蔷华对浙江的盛新华，广东的郑玉珊对上海的王莲芳。李莉在第二轮同上海的攻击手胡新成打满五局才以三比二获胜，狄蔷华在第三轮同湖北的削球手陈丽芳比赛时曾经输了一局。
    各地乒乓球队利用十一日休息的机会，普遍对前一阶段参加团体赛的情况进行了小结，提高了认识，并且决心再接再厉，在五个单项比赛中继续突出政治，打出风格，打出水平，使思想、技术得到双丰收。许多运动员尽管他们并不熟识，但是今天在练习场上却主动相约在一起练习，相互琢磨球艺，热情地交流着彼此的经验。不少运动员在比赛中虽然被淘汰了，也认真地坐在看台上观摩其他选手的比赛，虚心学习。
    男、女单打都将进行八轮淘汰赛，第四、五轮比赛将在十三日举行。（附图片）
