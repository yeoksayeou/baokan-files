    Jiangsu Knife Fish and Pufferfish Production Increases
    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing – Fishermen from fishery production cooperatives along the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province are casting nets and lines along the thousand-li river to catch knife fish and pufferfish. In Jingjiang, Jiangyin, Shazhou, Zhenjiang, and five other key fish-producing counties and cities, the catch of knife fish and pufferfish by the end of March has increased compared to the same period last year. Fishermen in Zhenjiang City have more than doubled their catch compared to the same period last year. Knife fish, pufferfish, along with anchovy, Chinese herring, and noodlefish are known as the five major fish species of the Yangtze River spring fishing season. Knife fish is famous for its tender meat and delicious flavor; pufferfish has an especially delicious taste, its skin can be used to make leather, and its oil can be refined into high-grade lubricating oil, with a wide range of uses.
    This year, the Yangtze River water level is suitable, and the water flow is rapid, so the fishing season will be longer than in previous years. The fish are arriving densely and are large in size, and a good harvest is expected.
    In Jiangyin, Shazhou, Jingjiang, and other places, many fishermen are breaking old habits in fishery production, exploring the migration patterns of fish during fishing, and promptly communicating their experiences and insights to each other, improving fishing methods in a timely manner, and reducing blindness in production, resulting in increased production for all fishing boats.

    江苏刀鱼河豚增产
    新华社南京电　江苏长江两岸渔业生产合作社的渔民，正在千里江面上张网下钩，迎捕刀鱼、河豚。靖江、江阴、沙洲、镇江等八个重点产鱼县市，到三月下旬捕获的刀鱼、河豚都比去年同期增加。镇江市渔民的捕获量比去年同期增加一倍以上。刀鱼、河豚，和凤尾鱼、鲥鱼、面鱼被称为长江春汛五大鱼类。刀鱼以肉嫩、味鲜而闻名；河豚的味道特别鲜美，皮可制革，油可提炼高级润滑油，用途较广。
    今年长江水位适宜，水势急，捕捞期将比往年延长。鱼来得密，体型大，可望丰收。
    江阴、沙洲、靖江等地许多渔民打破渔业生产中的旧习惯，在捕捞中摸索鱼类回游的规律，随时将经验和体会互相传告，及时改进捕捞方法，减少生产中的盲目性，因而各渔船普遍获得了增产。
