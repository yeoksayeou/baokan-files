    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi dispatch: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Armed Forces of Binh Dinh Province, South Vietnam, killed or wounded over 600 enemies during the counter-"mopping up" battles from March 23rd to 27th, the majority of whom were South Korean mercenary troops, and shot down two helicopters.
    On March 23rd, the American aggressors commanded two regiments of South Korean mercenary troops and one regiment of puppet troops, under the cover of two armored vehicle squadrons and thirty artillery pieces, to launch a "mopping-up" operation against eleven villages in the three districts of Tuy Phuoc, Phu Cat, and An Nhon in Binh Dinh Province.
    The Liberation Armed Forces and guerrillas fought valiantly, repeatedly repelling numerous enemy attacks, sometimes outnumbering them by more than ten to one. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy was forced to retreat on March 27th.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 11th dispatch: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Army and guerrillas of Bien Hoa, Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, and Phu Yen provinces in South Vietnam have recently launched continuous attacks, eliminating more than 530 enemy troops, including over 200 American aggressor troops and South Korean mercenary troops killed or wounded.
    From March 31st to April 3rd, the guerrillas of Xuan Loc district, Bien Hoa province, attacked enemy troops stationed in Binh Loc village, four kilometers northwest of Xuan Loc district town, wiping out 115 US and puppet troops.
    On March 25th, the Liberation Armed Forces of Dien Ban district, Quang Nam province, ambushed American aggressor troops conducting a "mopping-up" operation along the highway from Truong Giang to Phong Thu, killing or wounding more than 140. The next day, guerrillas from Loc Hung and Dien Xuan villages in the same district intercepted two companies of invading US troops, killing or wounding 23.
    From March 15th to 19th, the Liberation Army and guerrillas of Binh Dinh Province attacked the Ong To Bridge on Highway No. 1, two kilometers north of Binh Dinh city, and ambushed enemy convoys on the transportation lines, eliminating a total of 94 US puppet troops and South Korean mercenary troops.
    From the night of March 26th to the 27th, the Liberation Armed Forces of Phu Yen Province occupied the Han Ang and Ba Lao strongholds and attacked the Ha Trung and Phuc Loc "strategic hamlets" in Xuan Quang village, Dong Xuan district, eliminating a total of 161 enemies.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi dispatch: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the Liberation Army of Bien Hoa Province, South Vietnam, simultaneously and fiercely shelled the Xuan Loc airfield, the puppet regime's administrative organs in Xuan Loc district town, and many strongholds of the puppet army's 10th Division late on the night of March 27th.
    According to preliminary reports, the shelling destroyed a total of sixteen American helicopters and one L-19 reconnaissance aircraft, killing more than 100 enemies (including 25 American aggressor troops) and wounding many others. It also destroyed the puppet regime's administrative organs and US military dormitories.
    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 11th dispatch: According to the South Vietnam Liberation News Agency, the puppet army's 25th Division stationed in the Xin'an-Di'an area of South Vietnam has been routed under the heavy blows of the South Vietnam Liberation Armed Forces. According to incomplete statistics, more than 3,000 men in this division have been annihilated, including two entire battalions, nine companies, and many platoons that have been completely wiped out. Under the heavy blows of the Liberation Armed Forces, this division is rapidly disintegrating, with a total of more than 6,600 soldiers having deserted, including one battalion, seven companies, and seven platoons that have completely collapsed.
    Due to the repeated defeats of the puppet army's 25th Division, the US-puppet clique's "key pacification plan" in the Xin'an-Di'an area has failed. Not only has the enemy been unable to occupy an inch of land in this area, but in the past year, another sixteen villages have been liberated.
    The South Vietnamese puppet army's 25th Division was transferred to the Xin'an-Di'an area from central South Vietnam in September 1964. It was the backbone force carrying out the "key pacification" mission in this area. However, as soon as this so-called "battle-hardened" division arrived, it was subjected to continuous attacks by the local army and people. On the night of October 6, 1964, the army and people of Long An province dealt this division a head-on blow, pulling out its two strongholds in Shang Lianghe and Xia Lianghe in one fell swoop, and then annihilating the 1st Battalion of the 46th Regiment that came to its rescue, killing or wounding more than 300 enemies and shooting down three enemy aircraft. In this battle, nearly 100 enemies surrendered. Since then, wherever this division went, it was severely attacked by the local Liberation Armed Forces. In a counter-"mopping up" battle in Duc Hoa district in the early morning of June 26 last year, the Liberation Army completely wiped out the 3rd Battalion of the 49th Regiment of this division and its battalion headquarters. On the night of October 26 last year, the Liberation Armed Forces annihilated more than 700 soldiers of this division in Duc Lap.
    On the night of March 5 this year, while destroying an enemy sentry post and three guard towers in Long Thuong Lai town, Can Giuoc district, the Liberation Armed Forces also directly attacked the defense system of Saigon, completely wiping out a company of this division. The Liberation Army also shelled the headquarters of the 25th Division in Duc Hoa district town.
    The puppet army's 25th Division, which was defeated miserably by the army and people of Long An, was very demoralized and retreated without a fight. The 4th Battalion of the 46th Regiment, stationed in Long Hoa village, hastily retreated to Can Giuoc district town after being shelled by the Liberation Army.

    南越人民武装连续粉碎美伪“扫荡”歼敌千余
    边和解放军猛烈炮击春禄机场击毁美机十七架
    伪军第二十五师被打得溃不成军就歼三千多人
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方平定省解放武装力量在从三月二十三日到二十七日的反“扫荡”战斗中，共打死、打伤敌人六百多名，其中大部分是南朝鲜帮凶军，击落直升飞机两架。
    三月二十三日，美国侵略者指挥南朝鲜帮凶军两个团和伪军一个团，在两个装甲车队和三十门大炮的掩护下，对平定省绥福、符吉和安仁三个县的十一个乡发动“扫荡”。
    解放武装力量和游击队英勇奋战，接连打退了有时多于自己十倍的敌人的多次进攻。敌人遭到惨重失败后，于三月二十七日被迫撤退。
    据新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和、广南、平定、富安等省解放军和游击队，最近连续出击，歼灭敌军五百三十多名，其中打死打伤美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军二百多名。
    边和省春禄县游击队在三月三十一日到四月三日，袭击了驻在春禄县城西北四公里的平禄村敌军，歼灭美伪军一百一十五名。
    三月二十五日，广南省奠盘县解放武装力量袭击在张讲到丰黍的公路沿线进行“扫荡”的美国侵略军，打死打伤一百四十多名。第二天，这个县禄兴和奠春两个乡的游击队又截击来犯的两连美军，打死打伤二十三名。
    平定省解放军和游击队，从三月十五日到十九日，进攻位于平定市北面两公里的第一号公路上的翁座桥，并在交通线上伏击敌军车队，共歼灭美伪军和南朝鲜帮凶军九十四名。
    三月二十六日夜间到二十七日，富安省解放武装力量，攻占了汉昂、巴挝据点，并且袭击同春县春光乡的河中、福禄两个“战略村”，共歼灭敌人一百六十一名。
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方边和省解放军，三月二十七日深夜，同时猛烈炮击春禄机场、春禄县城的伪政权行政机关和伪军第十师的许多据点。
    据初步消息，这次炮击共击毁美国直升飞机十六架和L·19型侦察机一架，打死敌人一百多名（其中有美国侵略军二十五名）打伤多名，还摧毁了伪政权的行政机关和美军宿舍。
    新华社河内十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，驻在新安—堤岸地区的南越伪军第二十五师在南越解放武装力量的沉重打击下，已经溃不成军。据不完全统计，这个师已被歼灭了三千多人，其中有两个整营、九个连和许多个排被全歼。这个师在解放武装力量的沉重打击下，正迅速瓦解，共有六千六百多名士兵开了小差，其中有一个营、七个连和七个排已经完全瓦解。
    由于伪军第二十五师屡战屡败，美伪集团对新安—堤岸地区的“重点绥靖计划”已经破产。敌军不但无法占领这个地区的一寸土地，在去年一年中，反而又有十六个乡获得解放。
    南越伪军第二十五师是在一九六四年九月从南越中部调到新安—堤岸地区的。它是在这个地区执行“重点绥靖”任务的骨干力量。但是，这个所谓“善战”的师一到这里，就遭到了当地军民的连续进攻。在一九六四年十月六日夜间，隆安省军民给予这个师当头一棒，一举拔掉了它设在上良和和下良和的两个据点，接着又歼灭前来救援的第四十六团第一营，打死打伤敌人三百多名，击落敌机三架。在这次战斗中，还有近百名敌人投降。此后，不管这个师到什么地方，都遭到了当地解放武装力量的痛击。去年六月二十六日凌晨，解放军在德和县的一次反“扫荡”战斗中，又全歼了这个师第四十九团第三营及其营指挥部。在去年十月二十六日夜间，解放武装力量又在德立歼灭这个师的军队七百多名。
    今年三月五日夜间，解放武装力量在芹若县隆上莱市摧毁敌人一个哨所和三个岗楼的同时，还直接攻进西贡市的防御系统，全歼这个师的一个连。解放军还炮击德和县城第二十五师师部。
    被隆安军民打得落花流水的伪军第二十五师，士气十分低落，不战自退。驻在隆和乡的第四十六团第四营在遭到解放军的炮击之后，慌慌张张地撤回芹若县城。
