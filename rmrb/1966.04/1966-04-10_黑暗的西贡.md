    Dark Saigon

    Today's Saigon is overflowing with American soldiers. Soldiers from the U.S. Air Force, Marines, paratroopers, and logistical units swarm everywhere like maggots. Stepping out the door, American soldiers are the first obstacle people encounter, and American garbage is one of the first things people come across on the streets of Saigon. The garbage overflowing from the brightly lit, noisy, and frenzied American military dormitories piles up like mountains, emitting a foul stench. On these garbage heaps are many scantily clad, emaciated, and hunched figures. These are large groups of unemployed and starving people, as well as helpless elderly people and orphans, vying with swarms of green bottle flies for food. Hunger! Saigon is starving!
    Even many employees of the puppet regime and families of puppet soldiers are unable to escape the desperation of hunger and selling their children. It can be said that unemployment has made Saigon the city with the fastest growing blood-selling industry in the world!
    Yellow magazines, obscene movies, jazz music, and the decadent American lifestyle pouring in from the United States are flooding Saigon, eroding the minds of young people. Gang organizations named "C.T.Y. (Love Snatching Association)" and "Avant-Garde Movement" are corrupting Saigon's teenage boys and girls in batches, leading them down the path of crime.
    Hooligans and robberies are also rapidly increasing. Hooligan and robbery organizations such as "Black Hawk," "Bloody Hand," "Silver Heart," "Gray Tiger," "Motley Coat," and "Skull" are growing and spreading like poisonous mushrooms after the rain. Opening Saigon newspapers, one's eyes are filled with news of murder and robbery. Even these newspapers complain that the American devils are committing crimes with extreme ferocity.
    The disasters brought by the American robbers have aroused great hatred and powerful struggle among the people of Saigon. (According to materials from the Vietnamese newspaper "Thống Nhất" - "Unity").

    黑暗的西贡
    今天的西贡，到处充斥着美国大兵。美国空军、海军陆战队、伞兵和后勤部队的士兵，象是蛆虫一样，到处钻动。一出家门，美国兵是人们首先触目的障碍物，而美国垃圾也是走在西贡街头的人首先碰见的障碍之一。从灯火通明，发出乱乱哄哄、如痴似狂的爵士音乐的美军宿舍倒出的垃圾，堆积如山，臭气冲天。在这些垃圾堆上，有许许多多衣不蔽体、骨瘦如柴的佝偻身影。这是一大群一大群因失业而挨饿的人们和无依无靠的老人、孤儿，在那里与成群结队的绿头苍蝇争相觅食。饥饿！西贡正在饥饿中！
    就连许多伪政权的职员和伪军家庭也难免陷于饥饿、卖儿鬻女的绝境。可以说，失业，已使西贡成为世界上卖血业发展最快的城市！
    从美国涌进的黄色书刊、淫秽电影、爵士音乐和腐朽的美国生活方式，充斥西贡，侵蚀着青年们的心灵。以“Ｃ、Ｔ、Ｙ（夺爱会）”和“先锋派运动”等命名的歹徒组织，正在一批批地腐蚀西贡的青少年男女，使他们走上罪恶的道路。
    流氓、抢劫案也迅速增加。“黑鹰”、“血手”、“银心”、“灰虎”、“斑衣”、“骷髅”等流氓、抢劫组织，象是雨后的毒菌滋长蔓延。打开西贡报纸，满目都是杀人、抢劫的消息。就连这些报纸也抱怨美国佬在穷凶极恶地行凶。
    美国强盗带来的灾祸，激起西贡人民的极大仇恨和强大斗争。（据越南《统一报》材料）
