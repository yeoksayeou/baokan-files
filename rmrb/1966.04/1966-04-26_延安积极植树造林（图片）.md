    Yan'an Actively Plants Trees and Makes Forests
    Above: Over the past ten years, the people of Yan'an and the broad masses of young people have persisted in afforestation every year, and have achieved fruitful results. The trees on the mountains are already lush and verdant.
    Left: Yan'an's greening work has received support from all over the country. From Xinjiang in the northwest to Guangdong in the south, from Liaoning in the northeast to Sichuan in the southwest, precious seedlings and excellent tree species have been provided to support Yan'an's greening efforts. This is a scene of the masses in Yan'an sorting out seedlings provided by other regions, preparing to plant them.

    上图：十年来，延安人民和广大青少年每年坚持造林，已取得丰硕成果，山上树木已经郁郁葱葱。
    左图：延安的绿化工作，得到了全国各地的支援，从西北的新疆到南方的广东，从东北的辽宁到西南的四川，到处都拿出珍贵的树苗，优良的树种支援延安绿化。这是延安群众在整理外地支援的树苗，准备栽植。
