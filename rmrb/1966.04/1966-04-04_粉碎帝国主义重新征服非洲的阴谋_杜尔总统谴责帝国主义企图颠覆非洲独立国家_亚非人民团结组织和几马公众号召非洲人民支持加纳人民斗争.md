    Smash Imperialist Conspiracy to Reconquer Africa
    President Touré Condemns Imperialist Attempts to Subvert Independent African States
    Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization and Guinea-Mali Publication Call on African People to Support Ghanaian People's Struggle
    [Xinhua News Agency, Conakry] Guinean President Sékou Touré strongly condemned the subversion and corruption activities that imperialism is carrying out throughout Africa against the young independent states at a mass rally held here on March 27.

    About 70,000 people participated in the rally, which was held to celebrate the seventh anniversary of the founding of the Guinean African Democratic Revolution Youth Organization. Members of the National Political Bureau of the Guinean Democratic Party and government ministers participated in the rally. A Chinese youth delegation also participated in the rally.

    At the start of the meeting, the masses shouted: "Down with imperialism!" "Victory belongs to the glorious African people!"

    President Touré said that imperialism can change its tactics and practices, but all its conspiracies will be countered by the Guinean people.

    President Touré called on the Guinean people to further mobilize, smash counter-revolutionary plots, smash subversion, and stop betrayal.

    President Touré especially called on Guinean youth to raise their revolutionary vigilance and further raise their awareness to deal with the imperialist offensive.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Bamako] According to a report in the Malian newspaper *Développement* on March 25, trade union, women's, and youth organizations of Guinea and Mali passed a declaration at a meeting held in Bamako from March 14 to 17, calling on the people and revolutionary governments of African countries to remain vigilant and promote patriotism, and to resist any attempt by international imperialism to reconquer Africa.

    The declaration said, "The serious events that Africa is experiencing today, in the form of military coups and various subversive activities, are all within the scope of a large-scale reconquest plan formulated by imperialism to re-establish its ruling system in our countries and the system of exploiting our people and wealth."

    The declaration said that there is no, nor can there be, any possible compromise between imperialism and the African peoples who demand affirmation of their personality and the right to choose the path and methods of their national development without foreign interference.

    The trade union, women's, and youth organizations of the two countries condemned the selling out of the sovereignty of the African people to imperialism and the military coups which inevitably damage the future of the African continent, and expressed great indignation at the despicable actions and treachery of those who plotted the coup against the Nkrumah government in Ghana.

    [Xinhua News Agency, Cairo] The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement here on March 30, strongly condemning the military coup in Ghana and the suppression and persecution of the Ghanaian people and African freedom fighters by the coup authorities.

    The statement said: "It is now quite clear that the coup in Ghana was plotted behind the scenes by imperialists and neo-colonialists."

    The statement said that some African liberation movements have complained to the Secretariat that their members in Ghana have suffered hardship after the coup. In mentioning this point, the statement condemned the reactionary Ghanaian coup authorities for brutally persecuting students from other African countries and African freedom fighters in Ghana. The statement pointed out: "Many freedom fighters who have taken refuge in Ghana are now being tortured in prisons or handed over to imperialists and reactionaries in their own countries."

    The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization called on all progressive forces to support President Nkrumah and the Ghanaian people in their struggle against the usurpers and for the restoration of the rights of the Ghanaian people.

    据新华社科纳克里电　几内亚总统塞古·杜尔三月二十七日在这里举行的一次群众集会上，强烈谴责帝国主义正在整个非洲进行颠覆和腐蚀活动，来反对年轻的独立国家。
    大约有七万人参加了这次为庆祝几内亚非洲民主革命青年组织成立七周年而举行的集会。几内亚民主党全国政治局委员和政府部长们参加这次集会。中国青年代表团也参加了这次集会。
    会议开始时，群众高呼：“打倒帝国主义！”“胜利属于光荣的非洲人民！”
    杜尔总统说，帝国主义可以改变策略和做法，但是它的一切阴谋都将遭到几内亚人民的反击。
    杜尔总统号召几内亚人民进一步动员起来，粉碎反革命的图谋，粉碎颠覆，制止叛卖。
    杜尔总统特别号召几内亚青年提高革命警惕性，进一步提高觉悟来对付帝国主义的进攻。
    据新华社巴马科电　据马里《发展报》三月二十五日报道，几内亚和马里两国的工会、妇女和青年组织三月十四日至十七日在巴马科进行会晤时通过了一项声明，呼吁非洲各国人民和革命的政府保持警惕和发扬爱国主义精神，抵抗国际帝国主义重新征服非洲的任何企图。
    声明说，“非洲今天所经历的以军事政变和各种各样的颠覆活动形式出现的严重事件都是属于帝国主义为了在我们的国家重新建立它的统治制度和剥削我们的人民和财富的制度而制订的一个大规模的重新征服计划的范畴内。”
    声明说，在帝国主义和要求肯定自己的人格和在没有外国干涉下选择他们的国家发展的道路和方法的非洲各国人民之间，没有，也不可能有任何可能的妥协。
    两国的工会、妇女和青年组织谴责把非洲人民的主权出卖给帝国主义和不可避免地损害了非洲大陆的前途的这些军事政变，并对于在加纳针对恩克鲁玛政府策划政变的那些人的卑鄙行动和背信弃义表示非常愤慨。
    新华社开罗电　亚非人民团结组织书记处三月三十日在这里发表声明，强烈谴责加纳的军事政变以及政变当局镇压和迫害加纳人民和非洲自由战士。
    声明说：“现在已经十分清楚，加纳政变是帝国主义者和新殖民主义者在幕后策划的。”
    声明说，一些非洲解放运动向书记处申诉，它们在加纳的成员在政变后遭受苦难。声明在提到这一点时，谴责反动的加纳政变当局残酷迫害其他非洲国家的留学生以及在加纳的非洲自由战士。声明指出：“许多在加纳避难的自由战士现在都在监狱中受折磨或者被移交给他们本国内的帝国主义分子和反动分子。”
    亚非人民团结组织号召一切进步力量支持恩克鲁玛总统和加纳人民为反对篡夺者和恢复加纳人民的权利而进行的斗争。
