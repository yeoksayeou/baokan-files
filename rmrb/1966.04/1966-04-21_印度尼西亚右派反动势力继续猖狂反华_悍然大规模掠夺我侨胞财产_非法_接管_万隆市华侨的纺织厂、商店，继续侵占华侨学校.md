    Xinhua News Agency, 20th Dispatch from Jakarta: Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces are massively plundering the property and houses of overseas Chinese and seizing overseas Chinese schools.
    According to Antara News Agency, the right-wing organization "Indonesian Student Youth United Action Command" in Bandung illegally "took over" all textile factories owned by overseas Chinese in the city on the 12th, and handed them over to the army authorities. At the same time, right-wing groups also occupied shops opened by overseas Chinese in the city. According to the Associated Press, thousands of organized right-wing thugs in Jakarta traveled by truck to Bandung on the same day to "assist in this action."
    According to the army newspaper *Combat Daily*, right-wing groups in North Sumatra have "generally taken actions to take over buildings belonging to citizens of the People's Republic of China in the past two weeks. They have taken over actions not only in Medan, but also in small cities such as Pematangsiantar, Tebing Tinggi, and Belawan." The report stated that at least eight overseas Chinese school buildings and "foundations" have been "taken over" in Medan alone. Thirty-one overseas Chinese schools in the area have been "closed."
    At the same time, Azis, one of the heads of the Indonesian right-wing general clique and commander of the Siliwangi Division, recently brazenly ordered the closure of all overseas Chinese schools in West Java. The right-wing army authorities in South Kalimantan and South and Southeast Sulawesi have also recently issued orders to "take over" and "supervise" all local overseas Chinese schools.
