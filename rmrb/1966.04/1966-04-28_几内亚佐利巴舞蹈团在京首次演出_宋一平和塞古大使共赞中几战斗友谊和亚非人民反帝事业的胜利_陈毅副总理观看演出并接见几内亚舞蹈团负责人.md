    Ah, Mao Zedong, I sing of you, I sing of you.
    Your writings, ah, are infinite power,
    Your thoughts, ah, are a sun that never sets!
    If I go to Africa, I will dedicate this song to my black brothers;
    If I go to Europe and America, I will sing to my white brothers.
    Ah, no matter where I go, heading in which direction,
    I must spread this voice of truth,
    This truth is the battle call for freedom;
    This truth is the shining thought illuminating the universe!
    Your brilliance, ah, I can never sing enough of,
    But I will sing of you forever!
    Sing of you forever!"
