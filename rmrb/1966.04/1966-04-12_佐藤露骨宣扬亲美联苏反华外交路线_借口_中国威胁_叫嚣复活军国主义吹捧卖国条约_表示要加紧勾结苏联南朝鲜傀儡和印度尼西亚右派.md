    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, April 11th – Japanese Prime Minister Eisaku Satō, in Kyoto on the 9th, openly promoted his pro-US, pro-Soviet, anti-China foreign policy and also prevaricated about his unreasonable refusal to allow the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation to enter the country.

    Satō went to Kyoto to support the joint candidate nominated by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Democratic Socialist Party in the Kyoto Prefecture gubernatorial election.

    According to reports, in several of his talks in Kyoto, Satō repeatedly lauded the “Japan-US Security Treaty,” which sells out the interests of the Japanese nation and threatens Asian peace, and, using the fabricated so-called "China threat" as a pretext, clamored for the revival of Japanese militarism. During a street speech in Kyoto, Satō emphasized: “To protect Japan’s security, relying solely on the Japan ‘Self-Defense Forces’ is not enough. Because there is the ‘Japan-US Security Treaty,’ the United States will ‘protect’ Japan.”

    At a press conference held in Kyoto, Satō, in answering questions from Japanese reporters, once again prevaricated about his unreasonable refusal to allow the Chinese People’s Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation to enter the country, saying that "If there is no 'political problem,' there would be no refusal (of entry)." He also flatly denied that the Japanese government was pursuing a policy of following the United States in "containing" and antagonizing China. Furthermore, he shamelessly attributed the results of the progress in Sino-Japanese trade in recent years, achieved through the joint efforts of people in the friendly trade circles of China and Japan, to himself, in order to deceive the Japanese people.

    According to reports, in another speech, Satō also viciously slandered China for "interfering in (Japan's) internal affairs" and clamored to "eliminate the CCP's interference in internal affairs."

    Satō also stated that he would step up collusion with the Soviet government, the South Korean puppet clique, and the new regime controlled by the Indonesian right-wing general clique. He told Japanese reporters that he had accepted invitations to visit the Soviet Union and South Korea.

    Satō expressed his willingness to work for Indonesia's re-entry into the United Nations. He said: "When Indonesia announced its withdrawal from the United Nations, Japan tried to dissuade it. This time, it is only right for Japan to mediate for Indonesia to return to the United Nations."

    Satō also greatly boasted that the "Southeast Asia Development Ministerial Conference," convened to peddle the war policies and aggressive policies of US imperialism and for Japanese monopoly capital to carry out colonial expansion into Southeast Asia, had "made contributions to the peace and prosperity of Asia and the world."

    佐藤露骨宣扬亲美联苏反华外交路线
    借口“中国威胁”叫嚣复活军国主义吹捧卖国条约
    表示要加紧勾结苏联南朝鲜傀儡和印度尼西亚右派
    新华社东京十一日电　日本首相佐藤荣作，九日在京都，露骨地宣扬他的亲美、联苏、反华的外交政策，并且为无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境进行狡辩。
    佐藤是为了支持执政的自由民主党和民主社会党联合提出的共同候选人竞选京都府知事而去京都的。
    据报道，佐藤在京都的一些谈话中，多次吹捧出卖日本民族利益、威胁亚洲和平的“日美安全条约”，并且以凭空捏造的所谓“中国威胁”为借口叫嚣复活日本军国主义。佐藤在京都街头讲演时强调说：“保卫日本的安全，仅靠日本‘自卫队’是不够的。由于有‘日美安全条约’，美国将‘保卫’日本。”
    佐藤在京都举行的记者招待会上回答日本记者的提问时，再次为他无理拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境的行为狡辩，说什么“如果没有‘政治问题’，是不会拒绝（入境）的”。他还矢口否认日本政府奉行追随美国“遏制”和敌视中国的政策，并且，恬不知耻地把近几年来由于中日两国友好贸易界人士共同努力使中日贸易取得进展的成果，硬算到自己的账上，用来欺骗日本人民。
    据报道，佐藤在另一次发言中，还恶毒地污蔑中国“干涉（日本）内政”，并且叫嚣要“排除中共干涉内政”。
    佐藤还表示要同苏联政府、南朝鲜傀儡集团和印度尼西亚右派将领集团控制的新政权加紧勾结。他向日本记者说，已经接受了访问苏联和南朝鲜的邀请。
    佐藤表示要为印度尼西亚重新加入联合国而奔走。他说：“在印度尼西亚宣布退出联合国的时候，日本曾进行过劝阻。这次日本为使印度尼西亚重新回到联合国进行斡旋是理所应当的。”
    佐藤还大肆吹嘘为兜售美帝国主义的战争政策、侵略政策和为日本垄断资本向东南亚进行殖民扩张而召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”是“对亚洲和世界的和平和繁荣作出了贡献”。
