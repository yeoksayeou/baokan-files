    Hanoi, April 14 (Xinhua)  Hanoi's *Xin Yuehua Bao* published an editorial on the 14th, strongly condemning the increasingly frenzied anti-China atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces.
    The editorial stated that Overseas Chinese who have lived in Indonesia for generations have always lived in harmony with the Indonesian people, have made positive contributions to the development of Indonesia's socio-economy and culture, and have participated alongside the local people in numerous struggles against colonialist enslavement and rule.
    The editorial emphasized that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces' frenzied anti-Chinese movement and blatant persecution of Overseas Chinese are clearly intended to cater to the needs of imperialism, deliberately sabotage the friendly relations between China and Indonesia, and undermine the unity of the two peoples in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. The Indonesian government must fully bear the responsibility for the further deterioration of relations between China and Indonesia.
    The editorial listed the extremely brutal racist persecution crimes committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces against Overseas Chinese.
    The editorial expressed great indignation at the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces and expressed full support for the solemn position and demands of the Chinese side.
    The editorial expressed the most sincere sympathy to the Overseas Chinese brothers and sisters in Indonesia who are in dire straits, and expressed resolute support for their struggle to safeguard their legitimate rights and interests.

    印尼右派疯狂反华排华是迎合帝国主义需要
    据新华社河内十四日电  河内《新越华报》十四日发表社论，强烈谴责印度尼西亚右派反动势力日益疯狂的反华暴行。
    社论说，世代居住在印度尼西亚的华侨，一向同印度尼西亚人民和睦相处，对于发展印度尼西亚的社会经济和文化都作出了积极的贡献，并且曾经和当地人民一道进行过不少次反抗殖民主义奴役统治的斗争。
    社论强调指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力疯狂地掀起排华运动，明目张胆地迫害华侨，显然是为了迎合帝国主义的需要，蓄意破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国的友好关系，破坏两国人民在反对帝国主义、反对殖民主义斗争中的团结。印度尼西亚政府必须完全承担进一步恶化中国和印度尼西亚两国关系的责任。
    社论列举了印度尼西亚右派反动势力对华侨进行的极其残暴的种族主义迫害罪行。
    社论对印度尼西亚右派反动势力的法西斯暴行，表示极大的愤慨，并且表示完全支持中国方面的严正立场和要求。
