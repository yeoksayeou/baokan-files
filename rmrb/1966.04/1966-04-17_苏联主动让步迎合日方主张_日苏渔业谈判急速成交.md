    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 16th – According to Kyodo News Agency's Tokyo dispatch: The 10th Japan-Soviet Fishery Negotiations concluded on the 12th after the Soviet Union made concessions, and the agreement was signed in Moscow on the 14th.

    Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Tomisaburo Hashimoto said at a press conference held in Tokyo on the 13th: "I believe that this year's Japan-Soviet fishery negotiations were concluded faster than in previous years. Judging from the content of the agreement reached, the Soviet Union has withdrawn its initial proposal to reduce fishing vessels and has, in principle, accepted the Japanese side's opinion." He said that this negotiation "is a testament to the stable friendly relations between Japan and the Soviet Union." Kyodo News Agency's report also stated that the reason why these negotiations proceeded relatively quickly was mainly because the Soviet side "consistently showed an attitude of wanting to reach an agreement quickly" and "voluntarily made concessions."

    苏联主动让步迎合日方主张
    日苏渔业谈判急速成交
    新华社十六日讯　据共同社东京消息：第十次日苏渔业谈判在苏联作出让步后于十二日成交，十四日在莫斯科签署了协定。
    日本内阁官房长官（秘书长）桥本登美三郎十三日在东京举行的记者招待会上说：“我认为，（今年）日苏渔业谈判比起往年来，协议达成很快。从达成的协议的情况来看，苏联撤回了它当初提出的减少渔船的主张，原则上接受了日本方面的意见”。他说，这次谈判“是日苏两国友好关系稳定的一个证明”。共同社的报道还说，这次谈判所以进行得比较迅速，最大的原因是因为苏联方面“始终表现出赶紧达成协议的态度”，“主动地实行了让步。”
