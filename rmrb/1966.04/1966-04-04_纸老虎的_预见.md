    Paper Tiger's "Foresight"
    Leng Ran

    The French newspaper *Le Figaro* reported: "[The U.S. government] has built a 'communist prison' near the Fort Benning training camp in Georgia for officers to familiarize themselves with Chinese 'brainwashing' and various interrogation details, so that once captured, they will succumb to interrogation and accept 'brainwashing'. This training even includes making 'prisoners' endure mental and physical torture..."

    It seems that the authorities in Washington are quite "far-sighted" on certain issues. Before sending invading troops to South Vietnam for direct combat, they prepared "surrender letters" printed in thirteen languages for their soldiers. When the number of American troops invading Vietnam was only a little over two hundred thousand, they had already purchased four hundred thousand plastic body bags. Now, they haven't even started fighting the Chinese people, and they are already eagerly training officers on how to deal with "brainwashing" after being captured.

    "Brainwashing" is a term fabricated by imperialists to slander China. According to the interpretation of anti-China propagandists in Washington, "brainwashing" means using various forms of mental and physical torture to force people to change their thinking. It is said that this is an extremely cruel and terrifying method commonly used by China.

    This slander of China by American imperialism is actually their own confession. It is the American ruling group itself that has been trying to suppress and persecute all progressive and revolutionary ideas in the United States. The "Un-American Activities Committee" and the "Federal Bureau of Investigation," the "loyalty investigations" and "subpoena interrogations"... all sorts of fascist measures to control thought emerge one after another. However, thought can never be strangled by any means of persecution. The minds of millions of ordinary Americans can never be controlled by the American ruling group. Doesn't the current awakening of the American people powerfully illustrate this point?

    Indeed, after visiting China, many people have undergone tremendous changes in their thinking. But this is by no means the result of Chinese people using "cruel" and "terrifying" methods to "brainwash" them. The reason is that facts are more powerful than all lies. The various facts they saw in China shattered the various deceptive propaganda carried out by imperialists and reactionaries against them, thus enabling them to break free from deception, think clearly, and recognize the truth. If this is "brainwashing," then it is the truth that "brainwashed" them, and it is they who "brainwashed" themselves.

    Therefore, the measures currently taken by the Johnson administration to prevent "brainwashing" can only make people laugh. This so-called "foresight," in addition to vividly showing the outwardly strong but inwardly weak, blustering paper tiger nature of American imperialism, also clearly exposes how foolish and ignorant the American imperialists are!

### 纸老虎的“预见”

    纸老虎的“预见”
    冷然
    法国《费加罗报》报道：“（美国政府）在佐治亚州的本宁堡训练营附近，为军官们建立了一所‘共产主义监狱’，训练他们熟悉中国‘洗脑’和各种审讯的内情，以便一旦被俘在审讯中屈服和接受‘洗脑’。这种训练甚至包括使‘俘虏’忍受精神与肉体上的折磨……”
    看来，华盛顿的当权者在某些问题上倒是颇有“远见”的。他们在派侵略军到南越直接作战之前，就替士兵准备好用十三种文字印制的“求降书”。他们在侵越美军人数还只二十万挂零的时候，就先行购置了四十万只塑料尸体袋。现在，他们还没有动手同中国人民较量，又已经急着训练军官在当俘虏后怎样应付“洗脑”了。
    “洗脑”，是帝国主义者为了诬蔑中国而杜撰的一个名词。按照华盛顿反华宣传家的解释，“洗脑”就是用精神上和肉体上的种种折磨来强迫人们改变自己的思想。据说，这是中国惯用的一种极其残酷、万分恐怖的手段。
    美帝国主义者对中国的这种诬蔑，其实是他们的“夫子自道”。正是美国统治集团自己，一直妄想用镇压和迫害来禁绝美国的一切进步思想和革命思想。什么“非美活动委员会”和“联邦调查局”啊，什么“忠诚调查”和“传讯审问”啊……诸如此类为了控制思想而采取的法西斯措施层出不穷。但是，思想决不是任何迫害手段所能扼杀的。千千万万美国普通人的脑袋决不是美国统治集团所能控制的。目前美国人民的觉醒，不是有力地说明了这一点吗？
    的确，有不少人到过中国以后，思想发生了巨大的变化。但这决不是中国人用什么“残酷”“恐怖”手段对他们“洗脑”的结果。其原因在于：事实比一切谎言更有力量。他们在中国看到的各种事实，粉碎了帝国主义和反动派向他们进行的各种欺骗宣传，因而使他们能够摆脱蒙蔽而清醒地思考，认识真理。如果说这是“洗脑”的话，那末，是真理为他们“洗了脑”，是他们自己为自己“洗了脑”。
    因此，约翰逊政府目前所采取的预防“洗脑”的措施，只能使人闻而失笑。这种所谓“预见”，除了活灵活现地表明了美帝国主义外强中干、色厉内荏的纸老虎本相以外，同时也清楚地暴露了美帝国主义者是多么愚蠢无知！
