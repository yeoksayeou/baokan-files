    (Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, April 18th) Correspondent's Report: The South Korean people, carrying forward the glorious tradition of the "April 19th" People's Uprising, have launched a heroic and tenacious struggle against the colonial enslavement by US imperialism and the anti-people policies of the Park Chung-hee puppet clique.

    In recent times, US imperialists, in order to further advance their policy of aggression in Asia and salvage their disastrous defeat in the war of aggression against Vietnam, have intensified their colonial rule over the South Korean people. Under the orchestration of US imperialism, the Park Chung-hee clique and Japanese militarism concluded the "South Korea-Japan Talks," which had been dragging on for fourteen years, last year, and signed the "South Korea-Japan Treaty," reintroducing Japanese monopoly capital into South Korea and legalizing Japanese militarist aggression against South Korea. In order to cobble together an anti-communist alliance in Asia, US imperialism has also instigated the Park Chung-hee clique to engage in military and political collusion with US puppets such as South Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines. US imperialism has also directed the Park Chung-hee clique to dispatch South Korean puppet troops five times from September 1964 to April 1966 to participate in the war of aggression against Vietnam in order to implement their plan of "Asians fighting Asians."

    The South Korean people, regardless of the brutal suppression by US imperialism and the Park Chung-hee clique, have launched continuous struggles. In order to oppose the "South Korea-Japan Treaty" and oppose the re-invasion of Japanese militarism, the South Korean people have persistently engaged in various forms of struggle, including marches, demonstrations, strikes, and protest rallies. Last year alone, the South Korean people launched a movement to oppose the signing and ratification of the traitorous "South Korea-Japan Treaty" on multiple occasions, with over one million participants. South Korean youth and students stood at the forefront of this struggle. In August alone, over 300,000 youth and students from over 100 universities and middle schools in Seoul, Busan, and other regions participated. In the struggle, the students clearly put forward anti-American slogans such as "The mastermind behind the South Korea-Japan Treaty is the United States" and "The United States is not allowed to interfere in our internal affairs."

    Although the Park Chung-hee clique has brutally suppressed this patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people, the more severe the oppression, the stronger the resistance. Last year, South Korean youth and students repeatedly used violent means to fight against the puppet police and soldiers. After the "South Korea-Japan Treaty" was signed and ratified, many South Korean patriots also expressed their resistance and non-recognition of this traitorous treaty.

    The South Korean people resolutely oppose the Park Chung-hee clique's dispatch of South Korean puppet troops to South Vietnam to serve as cannon fodder for the American aggressors. On March 31st, leaders of the student union of Korea University in Seoul discussed the issue of holding a "rally to denounce the dispatch of troops to South Vietnam." Although some student leaders were persecuted by the Park Chung-hee clique, on April 1st, the student union launched a signature campaign to oppose the dispatch of troops to South Vietnam and demanded the reinstatement of students who were expelled for opposing the dispatch of troops to South Vietnam.

    South Korean workers, in order to oppose the national discrimination of US imperialism and the brutal exploitation of the Park Chung-hee clique, and to fight for their right to survival, have launched successive and powerful struggles. In the first eleven months of last year, more than 133,000 workers conducted 242 struggles. In the first two and a half months of this year, more than 280,000 South Korean workers conducted 92 struggles. The scale, scope, and duration of these struggles are unprecedented in more than a decade. The workers participating in the struggles were spread across six provinces in South Korea, including mines, power, chemical industry, ports, docks, transportation, and other sectors. More than 30,000 South Korean workers employed by the US military organs in South Korea were also involved in this struggle.

    South Korean farmers have also continuously struggled against the brutal oppression and plunder of the US-Park clique. Farmers in many regions demanded that the Park Chung-hee puppet authorities raise the purchase prices of agricultural products, lower fertilizer prices and irrigation water fees, and oppose the plunder of farmers' land, etc.

### 发扬“四·一九”人民起义光荣传统  南朝鲜人民坚持斗争反对美朴集团统治

    发扬“四·一九”人民起义光荣传统
    南朝鲜人民坚持斗争反对美朴集团统治
    据新华社平壤十八日电  本社记者报道：南朝鲜人民发扬“四·一九”人民起义的光荣传统，为反对美帝国主义的殖民奴役和朴正熙傀儡集团反人民的政策，展开了英勇顽强的斗争。
    最近一个时期以来，美帝国主义者为了进一步推行他们的侵略亚洲的政策，挽救他们在侵越战争中遭到的惨败，加强了对南朝鲜人民的殖民统治。在美帝国主义的撮合下，朴正熙集团和日本军国主义在去年结束了拖延十四年之久的“韩日会谈”，签订了“韩日条约”，把日本垄断资本重新引进南朝鲜，使日本军国主义侵略南朝鲜合法化。为了拼凑亚洲反共联盟，美帝国主义还唆使朴正熙集团同南越、泰国、菲律宾等美国傀儡进行军事和政治上的勾结。美帝国主义还指使朴正熙集团从一九六四年九月到一九六六年四月先后五次派遣南朝鲜伪军去参加侵略越南的战争，以推行他们的“亚洲人打亚洲人”的计划。
    南朝鲜人民不顾美帝国主义和朴正熙集团的残酷镇压，展开了连续不断的斗争。为了反对“韩日条约”和反对日本军国主义的重新入侵，南朝鲜人民一直坚持不懈地进行各种形式的斗争，其中包括游行示威、罢课、抗议集会等。在去年一年里，南朝鲜人民多次展开了反对签订和批准卖国的“韩日条约”的运动，参加的人数达一百多万。南朝鲜青年学生站在这一斗争的最前列，仅在去年八月，汉城、釜山等地区的一百多所大中学校，就有三十多万名青年学生参加。学生们在斗争中明确地提出：“韩日条约的主犯是美国”、“不准美国干涉我们的内部事务”等反美口号。
    尽管朴正熙集团对南朝鲜人民的这一爱国正义斗争进行了残酷的镇压，但是压迫越厉害，反抗就越强烈。在去年一年，南朝鲜青年学生曾多次采用暴力手段，同伪军警展开搏斗。“韩日条约”签订和批准后，许多南朝鲜爱国人士也一直表示抵制和不承认这一卖国条约。
    南朝鲜人民坚决反对朴正熙集团派遣南朝鲜伪军去南越替美国侵略者当炮灰。三月三十一日，汉城高丽大学学生会领导人讨论了举行“反对向南越派兵声讨大会”的问题。虽然有的学生领导人遭到了朴正熙集团的迫害，但在四月一日，学生会又发动了一个签名运动，反对向南越派兵，并要求恢复由于反对向南越派兵而被开除的学生的学籍。
    南朝鲜工人为了反对美帝国主义的民族歧视和朴正熙集团的残酷剥削、争取自己的生存权利，接连不断地展开声势浩大的斗争。在去年的头十一个月里，就有十三万三千多名工人进行了二百四十二次斗争。在今年的头两个半月的时间里，又有二十八万多名南朝鲜工人进行了九十二次斗争。斗争规模之大、范围之广和时间之长，都是十多年来所罕见。参加斗争的工人，遍及南朝鲜的六个道，包括矿山、电力、化学工业、港口、码头、运输等部门。南朝鲜美国侵略军机关雇佣的三万多名南朝鲜工人也卷入了这个斗争。
    南朝鲜农民为了反对美朴集团的残酷压迫和掠夺，也不断进行斗争。许多地区的农民要求朴正熙傀儡当局提高农产品收购价格，降低肥料价格和灌溉用水费用，反对掠夺农民的土地等等。
