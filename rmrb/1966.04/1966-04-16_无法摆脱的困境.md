    The struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the US-puppet clique continues to develop. Impacted by this surging wave of struggle, the infighting among the South Vietnamese puppets intensifies, and the political crisis in Saigon continues to worsen. Faced with this situation, the American aggressors, despite feigning composure, cannot conceal their fear and anxiety. The American propaganda machine cannot help but exclaim: "The situation in Vietnam is deteriorating."

    Responsible officials in Washington have repeatedly stated that the United States does not interfere in South Vietnam's internal affairs and will wait and see. This is completely false. The real situation is that the United States is actively intervening, manipulating behind the scenes, trying to reconcile the contradictions between the various factions within the puppet clique, and trying to suppress the struggle of the broad masses of the people in the US-puppet occupied areas against the US-puppet clique. However, how easy is this? Although the United States painstakingly directed the farce of the so-called "National Political Congress," it did not alleviate the infighting among the puppets, and of course, it could not calm the anger of the broad masses.

    The view of "U.S. News & World Report" reflects the feelings of the Washington authorities quite well. The magazine lamented that the chaotic situation in South Vietnam has "set back" the American war of aggression against Vietnam. At the same time, it helplessly wrote: "It is probably impossible to quickly achieve stability (in the South Vietnamese political situation) until after a major military victory on the battlefield." Moreover, "as the war continues, anti-American sentiment is likely to develop more and more." In other words, the United States in South Vietnam has fallen into a vicious cycle of military failure and political crisis. This also proves from the negative that the combination of political struggle and armed struggle by the South Vietnamese people is accelerating the complete failure of US imperialism and its running dogs.

    无法摆脱的困境
    越南南方人民反对美伪集团的斗争继续发展。在这汹涌澎湃的斗争浪潮冲击下，南越傀儡内讧越演越烈，西贡的政治危机有增无已。面对着这样的局势，美国侵略者尽管力装镇静，也掩不住它的惶恐不安。美国的宣传机器不禁惊呼：“越南局势正在每下愈况”了。
    华盛顿的负责官员一再表示，美国不干涉南越的内部事务，静以观变。这完全是假的。真实的情况是美国积极插手，在幕后进行摆布，力图调和傀儡集团内部各派系的矛盾，并且设法要把美伪占领区广大人民反对美伪集团的斗争压下去。但是，这是谈何容易呢？美国虽然煞费苦心导演了一出所谓“全国政治代表大会”的丑剧，却并没有能缓和傀儡之间的倾轧，当然更不能使广大群众的怒潮平息下来。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》的看法，是颇能反映华盛顿当局的心情的。这家杂志哀叹南越的混乱局面已使美国侵越战争“受到挫折”。同时，它又无可奈何地写道：“在战场上取得较大的军事胜利以前，大概不可能迅速实现（南越政局）的稳定。”而且“随着战争继续打下去，反美情绪很可能日益发展”。换句话说，美国在南越已陷于军事失败与政治危机二者恶性循环的困境之中。这也就从反面证明了，南越人民政治斗争与武装斗争相配合，正在使美帝国主义及其走狗加速走向彻底的失败。
