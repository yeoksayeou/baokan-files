    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 24th: Foreign representatives attending the Fourth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association spoke today at a rally in the capital of over 1,500 Chinese and Afro-Asian journalists celebrating "Afro-Asian Journalists' Day." They warmly congratulated the achievements of the Secretariat meeting of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association and unanimously expressed their determination to resolutely counter the deathbed struggles of U.S. imperialism and reactionaries. Their speeches were welcomed.
        Hoang Van Loi Emphasizes That People's War Is Invincible
    Hoang Van Loi, representative of South Vietnam, in his speech, once again strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for expanding its war of aggression in Vietnam and Indochina, committing heinous crimes, and condemned U.S. imperialism for constantly provoking China.
    Hoang Van Loi said that the people of South Vietnam are not afraid of U.S. imperialism, and the people of the entire Afro-Asian continents are also not afraid of U.S. imperialism. The victory of the Vietnamese people's struggle shows that what determines the outcome of war is not weapons but people. People's war is invincible.
    He said that the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the National Liberation Front, firmly grasp the guns in their hands. No matter what weapons U.S. imperialism uses, no matter how barbaric and brutal it is, we will fight to the end until we defeat the U.S. to its utter ruin and achieve the final victory.
    After Hoang Van Loi's speech, Liu Guiqi, head of the delegation of the Vietnam Journalists' Association, presented the "August 5th Victory Medal" to Chiao Kuan-hua and representatives of various countries. Liu Guiqi said that the medals presented to everyone are to express our deep gratitude to you and the unbreakable friendship between us; at the same time, it is also to affirm to you that we are always on the side of your struggle, on the side of the Afro-Asian people.
        Benazouz Welcomes the Second Afro-Asian Journalists' Conference to Be Held in Algeria
    Benazouz, the representative of Algeria, said when talking about the Second Afro-Asian Journalists' Conference to be held in Algiers, that this is the glory of Algeria. The next conference will promote the strengthening of the anti-imperialist front and launch attacks against imperialism and reactionary forces with greater vigor.
    Benazouz said that imperialism is in a dying struggle when progressive forces are launching increasingly powerful strikes against imperialism and their reactionary allies in many countries such as Vietnam and the Congo.
    He said that as journalists engaged in the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism, our responsibility is to serve the people who are fighting for freedom, justice and peace in our countries; our responsibility is to educate the masses and mobilize them so that they can have the power to build their countries and fight against all kinds of reactionaries and imperialism.
        Morrison Says Anti-Imperialist Forces Must Oppose U.S. Imperialism and False Revolutionaries
    Lee Morrison, representative of Azania (South Africa), emphasized in his speech that today's revolutionary anti-imperialist forces must fight on two fronts. One front is against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, and the other front is against false revolutionaries. We firmly believe that just as we are nailing nails into the coffin of imperialism today, we will also give these false revolutionaries a fatal blow. Because when their masters fall, those who surrender to imperialism will also surely fall. This is an inevitable law of nature. No force in the world can stop the people from completely eliminating imperialism.
    He said that we must expose and oppose these so-called "friends." They are dangerous, they are insidious and treacherous. We must not have illusions about them. We must not be deceived by their smiles. Because behind those smiles, hidden are the busy activities of sycophants, Judases.
    Morrison said that today, just as we are vigorously exposing all the lies of imperialism, exposing the lies of false revolutionaries, just as we are engaged in a life-and-death struggle with aggression-prone United States-led imperialism, some people tell us: we must cooperate with imperialism, we must compromise with it. The nature of imperialism has changed. And they themselves are closely cooperating with the imperialists.
    He said, please think about it: if you are fighting an enemy, and a "friend" comes to ask you to make peace with this enemy, then what attitude and position should you take towards this "friend"? If this "friend" of yours is actually colluding with your enemy, and even persuades you to lay down your weapons in front of the enemy, praise your enemy, excuse him, praise his crimes, and say it is a virtue, then what attitude and position must you take towards this "friend"? Naturally, this "friend" is no longer a friend, but a thing that is in collusion with your enemy, and you must regard this "friend" as dangerous as your enemy. In fact, this "friend" is even more dangerous than your enemy, because he can deceive you under the cloak of friendship and do a lot of bad things without being noticed.
    Morrison pointed out that this is what the false revolutionaries are doing today. The false revolutionaries have opposed us, deceived us, and are now singing the same tune as our enemy, and are now as dangerous as our enemy—the imperialists. Since they are like this, we must also fight them, we must also fight against them. We, the Afro-Asian people, have recognized the faces of these so-called "friends" through painful lessons. All of us present have suffered because of their betrayal and betrayal of our noble cause.
    He said that in the field of journalism, there is also no exception. The false revolutionaries put lipstick on imperialism, they collude with imperialism, and they honeymoon with imperialism. Should we work with them? Should we form a broad anti-imperialist front with them? We are firm opponents of imperialism, how can we form a broad anti-imperialist front with those who no longer oppose imperialism? They have actually surrendered to imperialism and are today trying to form a broad front with imperialists against our firm anti-imperialist forces.
    Morrison emphasized that we are here to reiterate our firm belief. This belief is that only by completely eliminating imperialism and colonialism, led by the United States, from the earth can we live a truly peaceful life and build our countries.
        Roger Decries That the Reversals Created by U.S. Imperialism and Its Lackeys are Deathbed Struggles
    Roger, representative of Cambodia, said that U.S. imperialism and its allies and lackeys have recently carried out the most barbaric aggression against countries around the world, and have caused reversals in the situation in some countries. However, all this does not prove their strength and invincibility, but on the contrary, only proves that they are in trouble and are making a deathbed struggle. Everything done by imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, and new and old colonialism will only accelerate their inevitable doomsday and cannot produce any other result.
    Roger condemned the aggression of U.S. imperialism and its Thai and South Vietnamese lackeys against Cambodia. He said that although the Cambodian people have been threatened, they have not been intimidated and will never be intimidated. They have completely rejected the so-called "U.S. aid," and they have adopted a "an eye for an eye" and "a tooth for a tooth" policy towards the troops of the United States, South Vietnam and Thailand.
    He said, why are the people of our country dare to defy the powerful force of the United States? This is because we believe that the strength of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys is far less than the strength of the people of a country who are united, determined, brave, and fighting for their just cause.
        Udaya Dharma Condemns the Fascist Rule in Indonesia
    Udaya Dharma, representative of Ceylon, said at the meeting that today, when celebrating Afro-Asian Journalists' Day, in front of the Chinese people, who are under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and in an important position in the people's struggle, and in front of the journalists who are fighting for the freedom of the Afro-Asian people, we firmly believe that the people can only achieve liberation by struggling under the guidance of revolutionary leadership.
    He said that the Chinese people have a first-rate important position in the struggle against imperialism and against the number one enemy of all countries in the world, U.S. imperialism. The Chinese people, under the revolutionary guidance of Chairman Mao Zedong, have achieved achievements that are sufficient to be a great example for all of us.
    He said that we oppose the despicable, dirty and brutal actions of the U.S. imperialist aggressors in South Vietnam, and we condemn in unison the fascist rule that controls Indonesia today. The fascists there recently massacred hundreds of thousands of innocent people, including children, young people and women. We oppose the United States' aggression against Laos and Cambodia, and oppose the United States' conspiracy to enslave the African people who have now stood up.
        Ramazani Emphasizes Taking a New Step Towards Defeating U.S. Imperialism
    Sebastien Ramazani, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Committee of Congo (L), warmly congratulated the Afro-Asian journalists for achieving a major victory in the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its agents in Jakarta. He said that the Afro-Asian journalists have withstood many tests, become stronger and stronger, gained new experience, and today are more confidently engaged in noble activities, the most glorious and noblest of which is to strengthen the struggle against all forms of U.S. imperialism.
    Ramazani said that the Afro-Asian journalists have dedicated themselves to their people through noble actions. The people of the Afro-Asian continents and the whole world have the most noble and precious desire in history, that is, to take a new step towards defeating imperialism and new and old colonialism, headed by the Washington government.
        Dian States That Guinea Is Determined to Smash Imperialist Conspiracies
    Jean-Baptiste Dian, representative of Guinea, said in his speech that at this moment when I am speaking, our country, like all other revolutionary and progressive countries in Africa and the world, is suffering from the unprecedented threat of neocolonialism and its lackeys. The correct political choices of our people and the revolutionary firmness of their leaders have made these people furious.
    He said that the incitement of the imperialist lackeys who have become spokesmen for neocolonialism will surely fail. The Guinean people, loyal to their guarantee as a bulwark of the anti-imperialist struggle, have recently crushed the conspiracies that have been constantly planned against our people. We are on high alert to prevent the next occurrence of this conspiracy.
        Supeno Says That the Indonesian People Are Invincible
    Supeno, representative of Indonesia, emphasized that imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and its defenders—false revolutionaries, are increasingly in trouble. Our task is to strike them even harder. There is no peaceful coexistence, no unity with them, and boundaries must be drawn.
    When elaborating on the importance of Afro-Asian people's solidarity against imperialism, Supeno said that it is very important to have a correct understanding of unity. The unity we are striving for is revolutionary unity. Asian unity is aimed at U.S. imperialism, all reactionaries and their defenders. The unity we are talking about is real unity, not hypocritical unity. Progressive Afro-Asian journalists can only talk about unity with those who are truly engaged in revolution. Some people regard the common enemy of the people of the world—U.S. imperialism—as a friend, and regard the People's Republic of China and its great people as the main enemy. We cannot talk about unity with such people.
    He said that not only can we not talk about unity with these defenders of imperialism, but on the contrary, we must fight against them. We must further enhance our vigilance, because it is precisely those who hypocritically uphold unity who are talking endlessly about the issue of "unity"; they not only talk a lot about unity, but also shout loudly about "joint action," but this is all hypocritical, and is a poison to true revolutionary unity. A clear line must be drawn between true revolutionaries and those who hypocritically uphold unity. Not only must we expose them, but we must also be vigilant not to allow those defenders of imperialism to sneak into our ranks.
    When talking about the current situation in Indonesia, Supeno said that the reactionary Suharto-Nasution regime has carried out unprecedented terrorist activities. They have completely relied on the United States in diplomacy and become the United States' loyal slaves, and they have carried out unprecedented anti-China racist activities.
    He said that those false revolutionaries who beautify imperialism and desperately step up joint actions with the United States to encircle China have played a shameless role in the current events in Indonesia. They pretend to support Indonesian progressives, but in reality, they are trying to split the revolutionary unity of Indonesia. They even clamored that if Indonesian revolutionaries do not listen to their commands, their friends, the Indonesian right-wingers and militarists, will strike at our revolutionaries. These false revolutionaries actually instigated the right-wingers to launch a terrorist movement against the progressives. Today, when we are facing attacks from the right-wingers, these false revolutionaries pretend to support us and sympathize with us, but behind the scenes, they are conducting secret talks with the Indonesian right-wingers and supporting these right-wingers. They even insisted that the right-wingers under General Suharto and Nasution are also "anti-imperialist" forces. This is how they betrayed the revolution.
    He said that no matter what tricks the imperialists and their defenders—false revolutionaries—play, the world situation is excellent. The upsurge of the national liberation struggle in Asia, Africa and Latin America and the struggle of the American people are the factors that determine the development of the situation. No matter how cunningly the false revolutionaries defend and support the United States, the glorious Vietnamese people have educated all of us to recognize that the most decisive factor is people, not weapons. U.S. imperialism and domestic reactionaries are paper tigers, and counter-revolutionary violence must be opposed with revolutionary violence. People's war will surely win.
    Supeno warmly congratulated the true revolutionary unity between the Chinese people and the Indonesian people. He said that in times of difficulty, people will distinguish who is his true friend. No matter how hard the Indonesian right-wingers try to undermine the friendship between the Indonesian people and the Chinese people, they must fail. The friendship between the two peoples is unbreakable, eternal, and cannot be shaken by the Indonesian right-wingers.
    Supeno said that no matter how much sacrifice it takes, the Indonesian people are invincible. Just as the Suharto-Nasution fascist regime cannot prevent the sun from rising in the east, they also cannot prevent the Indonesian people from winning.
        Kobayashi Yuichi Criticizes Sato for Reliving the Old Dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere"
    Kobayashi Yuichi, representative of Japan, said that imperialism headed by the United States is trying to make a comeback in the Asian region and stop the development of revolutionary forces. In Indonesia, it has taken the form of a counter-revolutionary coup and the subsequent white terror. But this does not show that imperialism is strong, but the opposite.
    Kobayashi Yuichi said that the Sato cabinet, which is obsequious to the United States, is reviving Japanese militarism more actively than the previous Liberal Democratic Party cabinets, and is trying to realize the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Sato government seeks to suppress domestic public opinion and the press, trying to drag the Japanese people onto the road of war. However, the Japanese people are unwilling to repeat the mistakes of invading China and launching the Pacific War. The people of Asian countries will not easily succumb to Japanese militarist aggression.
    Kobayashi Yuichi said that American imperialism and Japanese militarism are not only the common enemies of the Japanese people, but also the common enemies of the people of Asian countries. Afro-Asian journalists must further strengthen unity and cooperation in order to win the victory of the struggle of the people of various countries against these two enemies.
        Jiang Xiangwei Says That U.S. Imperialism Is the Common Enemy of the Afro-Asian People
    Jiang Xiangwei, representative of Korea, pointed out in his speech that the United States is the main stronghold of imperialism and the common enemy of the Afro-Asian people. The war policy and the aggression policy pursued by U.S. imperialism are currently concentrated in Vietnam. The American aggressors are gradually expanding the war against Vietnam under the guise of "unconditional discussions." He said that the Korean people and journalists will do everything possible to assist the Vietnamese people in their struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He said that we are determined to share life and death and share weal and woe with our Vietnamese brothers.
    He condemned U.S. imperialism for turning South Korea into a living hell and for instigating Japanese militarism and the South Korean puppets to sign the "South Korea-Japan Treaty." He said that the United States is attempting to use Japanese militarism as a shock force for aggression against Asia.
    Jiang Xiangwei condemned the Japanese militarists for attempting to relive the old dream of ruling Asia. He said that the Korean people cannot ignore the new acts of aggression of Japanese militarism.
        Ong Sang-ang States That He Is Determined to Smash the U.S. Imperialist Conspiracy to Invade Laos
    Zalen Ong Sang-ang, representative of Laos, condemned at the meeting the U.S. imperialist conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Laos, directly sending the army to forcibly occupy Lower Laos in Central Laos, attempting to divide Laos, and vainly attempting to link their battlefield in Laos with their battlefield in South Vietnam, so as to become a bridgehead for the U.S. military base in Thailand, threatening the northeastern territory of Cambodia. He said that this is an extremely dangerous and crazy military adventure plan that is severely condemned by the Afro-Asian people and the peace-loving people of the world. The Lao people, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, will inevitably unite and struggle against the aggressive U.S. imperialism and its lackey reactionary traitors. If U.S. imperialism and its lackeys stubbornly and recklessly expand the war of aggression against Laos, the Lao people and patriotic forces will resolutely smash its conspiracy of aggression.
    He said that the Lao people's struggle has received the support of the Chinese people and world progressive public opinion, and he wished the Chinese people greater victories under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.
        Kanneh Praises the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association for Its Contribution to Afro-Asian Anti-Imperialist Solidarity
    Lassina Kanneh, representative of Mali, said in his speech that the imperialists have supported puppets sitting on thrones made of U.S. dollars in various parts of Africa. However, we have seen through the nature of the enemy, estimated its strength, and noticed its subversive methods. Our people are united people who are determined to fight against imperialism. He said that when imperialism is gradually turning its spearhead of aggression to the African continent in order to implement new colonial and oppressive policies there, Malian journalists firmly believe that the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association has made effective contributions to the solidarity of Afro-Asia in the face of a common enemy.
        Cissoko Says That the Afro-Asian People Must Bury Imperialism
    Valentin Cissoko, representative of Mozambique, said that today we can proudly announce that we have become a formal member of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association. We have found a home—a home that is firmly anti-imperialist, a home that is getting stronger and stronger, a home that resists all false revolutionaries and all reactionaries. This home is a strong fortress against imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States.
    He said that Mozambique's journalists will be with all our brothers in Africa and Asia, the storm center of the world's struggle against U.S. imperialism, to finally and completely bury imperialism. No force can stop the Afro-Asian people from burying imperialism. All those who hinder progress, those reactionaries, those who advocate peaceful coexistence with the enemy, will all be wiped out when the surging anger of the people strikes.
        Abbas Emphasizes That Afro-Asian Journalists Must Bravely Retaliate Against U.S. Imperialism
    Abbas, representative of Palestine, said at the meeting that like all fighters who strive to achieve noble goals, we must arm ourselves with courage and truth. We have the firmest confidence in the future. We firmly believe that truth will prevail, and any fabrication, lie, deception and distortion will surely fail.
    He said that colonialism and imperialism are doing everything possible to play tricks and want to extinguish the Bandung Spirit. We Afro-Asian journalists must bravely retaliate against the conspiracies of international imperialism headed by Washington. He also condemned the Zionists for relying on the protection of colonialism, colluding with each other, and acting in collusion to viciously attack the people of various countries.
        Abukus Calls for Defending the Bandung People Who Are Suffering Persecution
    Abukus, representative of Syria, said that today, we are writing a new chapter in the history of the Afro-Asian people's struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism. The resolutions we unanimously passed at the meeting expressed the Afro-Asian people's condemnation of U.S. imperialism and all its servants—colonial countries and reactionary governments in Afro-Asia.
    He pointed out that in order to maintain the Bandung Spirit, the principles of people's revolution and the spirit of fighting journalism, it is now necessary to defend the Bandung people who are being persecuted by the Indonesian right-wing forces; it is necessary to continue to strike at U.S. imperialism until its final defeat.
    Syrian representative Abukus also read out a letter written by the heads of the various delegations of Arab countries participating in the meeting. The letter thanked the Enlarged Meeting of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association for its support of the Arab people.
        Wurata Calls for Supporting the Struggle of the Indonesian and Ghanaian People
    George Wurata, representative of Tanzania, said that the people of Africa and Asia have awakened and stood up, and some brothers and sisters who have not yet achieved independence and freedom are fighting with weapons, especially at present many Afro-Asian countries are in the battle against imperialism and new and old colonialism headed by the United States. In countries that have already achieved independence, imperialism wants to enter from the back door, but the people have been vigilant and maintained unity.
    Wurata said that the United States is getting deeper and deeper into the quagmire of aggression in Vietnam, and it will inevitably fail more miserably and die faster. He said that reactionary fascist military rule and bloody massacres cannot scare the people; the just cause of the people of Indonesia and Ghana will surely win.
    Wurata said that the Afro-Asian Journalists are a fighting organization that unites and educates the broad masses of people, exposes and smashes all conspiracies of the U.S. "Central Intelligence Agency", and is an organization that resolutely fights against imperialism and new and old colonialism in Africa and Asia. The Afro-Asian Journalists' Association will continue to forge ahead towards the goals set by the Bandung Conference and the spirit of the "Jakarta Declaration".
        Brazil Expresses Its Support for the Chinese People's Anti-Imperialist and Anti-Colonial Struggle
    Ibrahim Said al-Baz, representative of the United Arab Republic, said in his speech that we have met many, many friends in Beijing. We felt a friendly, kind and honest feeling. When our country was invaded, Chinese journalists firmly supported us against the invading imperialists. This is something we will never forget. Egyptian journalists will always support the People's Republic of China in its struggle against colonialism, imperialism and neocolonialism.
        Muwuti Says That the Paper Tiger of U.S. Imperialism Has Been Exposed
    Don Muwuti, representative of Zimbabwe, introduced the armed struggle of the people of Zimbabwe for liberation. He said that our liberation is aimed at the British and American imperialists. He said that there are some very subtle chapters in the history of the anti-imperialist liberation struggle, that is, the imperialist enemies constantly create some of the best weapons to deal with the oppressed people of all countries, but in the end, the oppressed people of all countries use the weapons created by the imperialists to defeat them. He said that we, as victims of imperialist oppression, can categorically say that it is impossible and unacceptable for us to live in peace with imperialism; it is completely shameless for anyone to want the oppressed people of the world to coexist with their oppressors. He said that the Vietnamese brothers are proving every moment that the paper tiger of U.S. imperialism can indeed be exposed again and again. This is not only the case in Vietnam, but it will be the case anywhere else in the world. The future belongs to the people, whether the imperialist exploiters like it or not.

### 各国新闻界代表在首都庆祝“亚非新闻工作者日”集会上讲话  热烈祝贺亚非记协书记处会议成功  坚决反击美帝和反动派的垂死挣扎

    各国新闻界代表在首都庆祝“亚非新闻工作者日”集会上讲话
    热烈祝贺亚非记协书记处会议成功  坚决反击美帝和反动派的垂死挣扎
    据新华社二十四日讯　出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的各外国代表，今天在首都举行的一千五百多名中国和亚非国家新闻工作者庆祝“亚非新闻工作者日”的集会上讲了话。他们热烈祝贺亚非新闻工作者协会书记处会议的成就，一致表示要坚决反击美帝国主义和反动派的垂死挣扎。他们的讲话都受到了欢迎。
        黄万里强调人民战争是不可战胜的
    越南南方代表黄万里在讲话中，再次强烈谴责美帝国主义在越南和印度支那扩大侵略战争，犯下了滔天罪行，谴责美帝国主义不断向中国进行挑衅。
    黄万里说，越南南方人民不怕美帝国主义，整个亚非两大洲人民也是不怕美帝国主义的。越南人民斗争的胜利表明，决定战争胜负的不是武器而是人。人民战争是不可战胜的。
    他说，越南南方人民在民族解放阵线的领导下，坚决紧握手中枪。不管美帝国主义使用什么武器，不管它多么野蛮残暴，我们都要战斗到底，直到把美帝打得一败涂地，取得最后的胜利。
    黄万里讲话后，越南新闻工作者协会代表团团长刘贵淇将“八·五胜利徽章”赠送给查禾多和各国代表。刘贵淇说，赠送给大家的这些徽章，是为了表达对你们的深切谢意以及我们同你们之间牢不可破的友谊；同时也是向你们肯定，我们时刻站在你们的战斗的一边，站在亚非人民的一边。	  贝纳佐兹欢迎第二次亚非记者会议在阿召开
    阿尔及利亚代表贝纳佐兹谈到第二次亚非新闻工作者会议将在阿尔及尔召开时说，这是阿尔及利亚的光荣。下次会议将促进反帝阵线的加强，以更大的活力开始对帝国主义和反动势力发动进攻。
    贝纳佐兹说，进步力量在越南、刚果等许多国家对帝国主义和他们的反动同盟者进行越来越有力的打击时，帝国主义陷于垂死挣扎中。
    他说，作为从事反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的新闻工作者，我们的责任就是为我们各国争取自由、正义和和平而斗争的人民服务；我们的责任就是教育群众，把他们动员起来，使他们能有力量建设他们的国家，并且和形形色色的反动派和帝国主义作斗争。	  摩里逊说反帝力量必须反对美帝和假革命者
    阿扎尼亚（南非）代表里·摩里逊在讲话中强调指出，今天革命的反帝力量必须在两条战线上作战。一条战线是反对美帝国主义及其走狗，另一条战线是反对假革命者。我们深信，正象我们今天正在向帝国主义的棺材钉钉子一样，我们也将给予这些假革命者以致命的打击。因为当他们的主子垮台的时候，那些向帝国主义投降的人也定将垮台。这是不可避免的自然规律。世界上没有任何力量能阻挡人民彻底消灭帝国主义。
    他说，我们一定要揭露和反对这些所谓的“朋友”。他们是危险的，他们是阴险奸诈的。我们决不能对他们抱幻想。我们决不要为他们的那些微笑所欺骗。因为在那些微笑的背后，隐藏着迎合者们，犹大们的繁忙的活动。
    摩里逊说，今天正当我们在大力揭露一切帝国主义的谎言，揭露假革命者的谎言的时候，正当我们同以侵略成性的美国为首的帝国主义进行殊死斗争的时候，有人对我们说：我们必须同帝国主义合作，我们必须同它妥协。帝国主义的本性已改变了。而他们自己正是在同帝国主义者密切配合。
    他说，请大家想一下：如果你在同一个敌人进行斗争，一个“朋友”走来要你同这个敌人讲和，那么你应当对这个“朋友”采取什么态度和立场呢？如果你的这个“朋友”实际上同你的敌人是勾搭一起的，而且竟至于劝你在敌人面前放下你的武器，称赞你的敌人，为他开脱，赞美他的罪行，把它说成是美德，那么你对你的这个“朋友”必须采取什么态度和立场呢？很自然，这个“朋友”不再是什么朋友了，而是同你的敌人串通一气的货色，你一定要把这个“朋友”看作是同你的敌人一样危险。实际上，这个“朋友”甚至比你的敌人更加危险，因为他能够在友谊的外衣掩盖下欺骗你，干了很多坏事而不被察觉。
    摩里逊指出，这就是今天假革命者们正在干的事情。假革命者反对过我们，欺骗过我们，现在同我们的敌人一鼻孔出气，现在和我们的敌人——帝国主义者——一样危险。他们既然是这样，就必须也对他们进行斗争，必须也同他们作战。我们亚非人民通过沉痛的教训认清了我们的这些所谓的“朋友”的面目。我们全体在座的都由于他们对我们崇高的事业的背信弃义和背叛而吃过苦头。
    他说，在新闻工作方面，同样也没有例外。假革命者为帝国主义涂脂抹粉，他们同帝国主义勾结在一起，同帝国主义一起度蜜月。难道我们应该和他们共同工作吗？难道我们应该同他们一起结成广泛的反帝战线吗？我们是坚定反对帝国主义的人，怎么能同不再反帝的分子结成广泛的反帝战线呢？他们实际上已向帝国主义投降而且今天正企图同帝国主义分子结成反对我们坚定反帝力量的广泛的战线。
    摩里逊强调说，我们在这里要重申我们的坚定信念。这个信念就是只有把以美国为首的帝国主义和殖民主义彻底地从地球上消灭，我们才能过上真正的和平生活，才能建设我们的国家。	  罗杰多说美帝及其走狗制造逆转是垂死挣扎
    柬埔寨代表罗杰多说，美帝国主义及其同盟者和走狗，最近对世界各国进行了最野蛮的侵略，而且在某些国家中使局势发生了逆转。但是，这一切决不证明他们的强大和不可战胜，相反，只能证明他们已经陷入困境，在作垂死挣扎。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义所干的一切，只会加速他们不可避免的末日的到来，而不可能产生别的结果。
    罗杰多谴责了美帝国主义及其泰国和南越的走狗对柬埔寨的侵略。他说，尽管柬埔寨人民受到了威胁，但是他们并没有被吓倒，也永远不会被吓倒。他们已经完全拒绝了所谓的“美援”，他们对美国、南越和泰国的军队，采取了“以眼还眼”和“以牙还牙”的政策。
    他说，为什么我国人民敢于不畏美国的强大力量呢？这是因为我们相信，美帝国主义及其走狗的力量远远不如团结起来、坚决勇敢为自己的正义事业而斗争的一个国家人民的力量。	  乌达亚达马谴责印度尼西亚的法西斯统治
    锡兰代表乌达亚达马在会上说，今天在庆祝亚非新闻工作者日的时候，在毛泽东主席领导下、处于人民斗争重要地位的中国人民面前，在为亚非人民自由而斗争的新闻工作者面前，我们坚信，人民只有在革命领导的指导下进行斗争才能获得解放。
    他说，中国人民在反对帝国主义和反对世界各国头号敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，具有头等重要的地位。中国人民在毛泽东主席的革命指导下取得了足以成为我们大家的伟大榜样的业绩。
    他说，我们反对美帝国主义侵略者在南越的可鄙、肮脏和残暴的行动，我们同声谴责今天控制着印度尼西亚的法西斯统治。那里的法西斯分子最近屠杀了几十万无辜的人民，其中包括儿童、青年和妇女。我们反对美国对老挝和柬埔寨的侵略，反对美国想奴役现在已经站起来的非洲人民的阴谋。	  拉马扎尼强调要为战胜美帝迈出新的一步
    刚果（利）全国解放委员会代表团团长塞巴斯蒂安·拉马扎尼在讲话中，热烈祝贺亚非新闻工作者对美帝国主义及其在雅加达的代理人的斗争中取得了重大胜利。他说，亚非新闻工作者经受了许多考验，变得越来越坚强，获得了新的经验，今天更充满信心地从事崇高的活动，其中最光荣、最高尚的活动就是加强反对美帝国主义的一切形式的斗争。
    拉马扎尼说，亚非新闻工作者通过崇高的行动已献身于他们的人民。亚非两大洲和全世界人民有着历史上最崇高、最宝贵的愿望，那就是为战胜以华盛顿政府为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义迈出新的一步。
          迪恩表示几内亚坚决粉碎帝国主义阴谋
    几内亚代表让·巴蒂斯特·迪恩在讲话中说，正在我讲话的此刻，我们的国家象非洲和全世界的所有其它革命和进步的国家一样，遭受到新殖民主义及其走狗的空前威胁，我国人民正确的政治选择和他们的领导人的革命坚定性，使得这些人暴跳如雷。
    他说，已经变成新殖民主义代言人的帝国主义走狗的鼓动必将落空。忠于其保证作为反帝斗争堡垒的几内亚人民，最近已经粉碎了不断对我国人民策划的阴谋。我们正在严阵以待，防备这种阴谋的下一次出现。	  苏佩诺表示印度尼西亚人民是不可征服的
    印度尼西亚代表苏佩诺强调说，以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义及其辩护士——假革命者，越来越陷入困境。我们的任务是更狠地打击他们。同他们没有和平共处，没有团结，界限必须划清。
    苏佩诺阐述亚非人民团结反帝的重要性时说，取得关于团结的正确理解是十分重要的。我们所争取的团结是革命的团结。亚洲的团结是针对美帝国主义、一切反动派及其辩护士的。我们说的团结，是真正的团结，不是虚伪的团结。亚非进步的新闻工作者只能同那些真正干革命的人讲团结。有些人把世界人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义当做朋友，而把中华人民共和国及其伟大人民当作主要的敌人，对这样的人是不能讲团结的。
    他说，我们不但不能同这些帝国主义的辩护士讲团结，相反我们要同他们进行斗争。我们必须进一步提高警惕，因为正是那些虚伪地维护团结的人在喋喋不休地谈“团结”问题；他们不但大谈团结，而且大叫大嚷说什么要“联合行动”，可是这都是虚伪的，对真正的革命的团结说来是毒素。真正的革命者和虚伪维护团结的人之间必须划清界限，我们不但要揭露他们，而且必须提高警惕，不要使那些帝国主义的辩护士钻进我们的队伍中来。
    苏佩诺在谈到印度尼西亚当前的局势时说，反动的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安政权进行了史无前例的恐怖活动，他们在外交上完全投靠美国并成为美国的忠实奴仆，他们进行了空前的反华种族主义活动。
    他说，那些美化帝国主义、拼命加紧同美国一起采取包围中国的联合行动的假革命者，在目前印度尼西亚发生的事件中起了无耻的作用。他们假装支持印度尼西亚进步分子，而实际上却企图分裂印度尼西亚的革命团结。他们甚至扬言，如果印度尼西亚革命者不听他们的指挥棒指挥，他们的朋友印度尼西亚右派分子和军国主义分子就要打击我们革命者。这些假革命者实际上唆使右派分子对进步分子掀起恐怖运动。今天当我们面临右派分子进攻的时候，这些假革命者又假装支持我们，同情我们，但是在幕后他们却同印度尼西亚右派分子进行秘密会谈并支持这些右派分子。他们甚至硬说苏哈托和纳苏蒂安将军手下的右派分子也是“反帝”力量，他们就是这样背叛革命的。
    他说，无论帝国主义者和他们的辩护士——假革命者玩弄什么花招，世界局势是大好的。亚非拉美民族解放斗争及美国人民斗争的高涨，是决定局势发展的因素。不管假革命者怎样狡猾地维护和支持美国，光荣的越南人民已经教育我们大家认识到，最有决定性的因素是人而不是武器，美帝国主义和国内反动派是泥足巨人，必须以革命的暴力来反对反革命的暴力，人民战争一定将获得胜利。
    苏佩诺热烈祝贺中国人民和印度尼西亚人民之间的真正的革命团结。他说，在困难的时候，人们就会分辨出谁是他真正的朋友。无论印度尼西亚右派分子怎样竭力破坏印度尼西亚人民和中国人民之间的友谊，他们一定要失败。两国人民之间的友谊是牢不可破的，是永恒的，是印度尼西亚右派分子所动摇不了的。
    苏佩诺说，无论要付出多大的牺牲，印度尼西亚人民是不可征服的。正如苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权不能阻止太阳从东方升起一样，他们同样也不能阻止印度尼西亚人民获得胜利。	  小林雄一斥佐藤重温“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦
    日本代表小林雄一说，以美国为首的帝国主义试图在亚洲地区卷土重来，制止革命力量的发展。它在印度尼西亚采取的形式是反革命政变和继之而来的白色恐怖。但是这并不表明帝国主义强大，而是相反。
    小林雄一说，对美国卑躬屈膝的佐藤内阁，比以往历届自由民主党内阁都更加活跃地复活日本军国主义，妄图实现“大东亚共荣圈”的老梦。佐藤政府谋求压制国内舆论和报界，妄图把日本人民拖上战争道路。但是，日本人民不愿重犯侵略中国和发动太平洋战争的错误。亚洲各国人民也不会轻易向日本军国主义侵略屈服。
    小林雄一说，美国帝国主义和日本军国主义不仅仅是日本人民的共同敌人，而且是亚洲各国人民的共同敌人。亚非新闻工作者必须进一步加强团结和合作，以便争取各国人民反对这两个敌人的斗争的胜利。
        姜相渭说美帝是亚非人民的共同敌人
    朝鲜代表姜相渭在讲话中指出，美国是帝国主义的主要堡垒，是亚非人民的共同敌人。美帝国主义奉行的战争政策和侵略政策，当前集中表现在越南。美国侵略者正在“无条件讨论”的掩饰下，逐步扩大对越南的战争。他表示，朝鲜人民和新闻工作者将尽一切可能援助越南人民进行抗美救国斗争。他说，我们坚决同越南兄弟同生死，共患难。
    他谴责美帝国主义把南朝鲜变成一座人间地狱，唆使日本军国主义和南朝鲜傀儡签订“韩日条约”。他说，美国正企图把日本军国主义作为侵略亚洲的突击队。
    姜相渭谴责日本军国主义者企图重温统治亚洲的旧梦。他说，朝鲜人民对日本军国主义新的侵略行动，决不能置之不理。
    翁桑昂表示坚决粉碎美帝侵略老挝阴谋
    老挝代表扎伦·翁桑昂在会上谴责了美帝国主义阴谋扩大对老挝的侵略战争，直接派陆军强占老挝的中寮下寮，企图分割老挝，妄想把它们在老挝的战场和在南越的战场联结起来，以便成为美国在泰国军事基地的桥头堡，威胁柬埔寨东北部领土。他说，这是受到亚非人民和世界爱好和平人类的严厉谴责的一个极其危险和疯狂的军事冒险计划。老挝人民在爱国战线党的领导下，必然团结一致，进行斗争，反对侵略成性的美帝国主义及其走狗反动派卖国贼。如果美帝国主义及其走狗还要顽固冒险地扩大对老挝的侵略战争，老挝人民和爱国力量将坚决粉碎它的侵略阴谋。
    他谈到，老挝人民的斗争得到了中国人民和世界进步舆论的支持，他祝中国人民在毛泽东主席的领导下取得更伟大的胜利。卡内赞扬亚非记协对亚非反帝团结的贡献
    马里代表拉西纳·卡内在讲话中说，帝国主义者在非洲各地扶植了坐在用美元做成的宝座上的傀儡。但是，我们已经看透了敌人的本性，估量了它的力量，注意到它的颠覆方法。我们的人民是团结一致坚决进行反帝斗争的人民。他说，在帝国主义逐渐把侵略的矛头转向非洲大陆以便在那里执行新的殖民和压迫政策的时候，马里新闻工作者坚信亚非新闻工作者协会对亚非在面临共同敌人时的团结作了有效的贡献。
        西索尔说亚非人民一定要埋葬帝国主义
    莫三鼻给代表瓦朗蒂姆·西索尔说，今天我们能够自豪地宣布，我们已成为亚非记协的正式会员了，我们找到了一个家——一个坚决反帝的家，一个越来越强大的家，这个家抵制一切假革命家和一切反动分子。这个家是反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的强大堡垒。
    他说，莫三鼻给的新闻工作者将同世界反对美帝国主义斗争的风暴中心非洲和亚洲的我们全体兄弟们在一起，最后地、彻底地埋葬帝国主义。任何力量都阻止不了亚非人民埋葬帝国主义。所有那些阻碍前进的人，那些反动派，那些鼓吹同敌人和平共处的人，在人民汹涌澎湃的怒潮冲击时，将统统被消灭掉。	  阿巴斯强调亚非新闻工作者要勇敢回击美帝
    巴勒斯坦代表阿巴斯在会上说，象所有为实现高尚目标而奋斗的战士一样，我们必须用勇敢精神和真理来武装自己。我们对未来有着最坚定的信心。我们坚信，真理必胜，任何捏造、谎言、欺骗和歪曲都必将失败。
    他说，殖民主义和帝国主义正在千方百计地玩弄花招，想要扑灭万隆精神。我们亚非新闻工作者要勇敢地回击以华盛顿为首的国际帝国主义的阴谋。他还谴责犹太复国主义者寄托在殖民主义的卵翼之下，互相勾结，狼狈为奸，对各国人民进行恶毒的攻击。
    阿布库斯要求捍卫遭受迫害的万隆人民
    叙利亚代表阿布库斯说，今天，我们在亚非人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争的历史上写下了新的一章。我们在会议上一致通过的决议，表示了亚非人民对美帝国主义及其所有的仆从——殖民国家和亚非各反动政府的谴责。
    他指出，要维护万隆精神，人民革命的原则和战斗的新闻工作的精神，目前就要捍卫正遭受印度尼西亚右派势力迫害的万隆人民；就必须继续打击美帝国主义，直到它最后失败。
    叙利亚代表阿布库斯在会上还宣读了参加会议的阿拉伯国家各个代表团团长所写的一封信。信中感谢亚非记协扩大会议对阿拉伯人民的支持。
    伍拉塔要求支援印尼和加纳人民斗争
    坦桑尼亚代表乔治·伍拉塔说，非洲和亚洲人民已经觉醒并站起来了，一些还没有取得独立和自由的兄弟姐妹正手拿武器进行战斗，特别是当前许多亚非国家处在同以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义的战斗中。在已经取得独立的国家里，帝国主义想从后门进来，但是人民已经有了警惕，保持着团结。
    伍拉塔说，美国侵略越南的泥足越陷越深，必将失败得更惨，死亡得更快。他说，反动的法西斯军事统治和血腥屠杀吓不倒人民；印度尼西亚和加纳人民的正义事业，必将取得胜利。
    伍拉塔说，亚非新闻工作者是团结教育广大人民，揭露和粉碎美国“中央情报局”的一切阴谋诡计的战斗组织，是在非洲和亚洲坚决同帝国主义和新老殖民主义进行斗争的组织。亚非新闻工作者协会将朝着万隆会议确定的目标和《雅加达宣言》精神，继续奋勇前进。
    巴西表示支持中国人民反帝反殖斗争
    阿联代表易卜拉欣·赛义德·巴西在讲话中说，我们在北京会见了许许多多的朋友。我们感到了一片友好、亲切而正直的感情。在我国遭受侵略的时候，中国新闻工作者坚决地支持我们反对入侵的帝国主义。这是我们永远也忘不了的。埃及新闻工作者将始终支持中华人民共和国反对殖民主义、帝国主义和新殖民主义的斗争。
    穆伍蒂说美帝国主义纸老虎已被戳穿
    津巴布韦代表唐·穆伍蒂在讲话中介绍了津巴布韦人民争取解放的武装斗争。他说，我们的解放是针对英美帝国主义者的。他说，反帝解放斗争的历史上有一些十分微妙的篇章，那就是帝国主义敌人不断制造一些最好的武器来对付被压迫的各国人民，但是到头来，被压迫的各国人民却用帝国主义制造的武器把他们打败。他说，我们作为帝国主义压迫的受害者可以断然地说，要我们同帝国主义相安无事是不可能的，不能接受的；如果有人要世界被压迫人民同他们的压迫者共处，那完全是厚颜无耻。他说，越南兄弟正在每时每刻地证明，美帝国主义纸老虎事实上是能够戳穿再戳穿的。这不仅在越南是这样，而且在世界其他任何别的地方也会是这样。未来属于人民，不管帝国主义剥削者喜欢不喜欢。
