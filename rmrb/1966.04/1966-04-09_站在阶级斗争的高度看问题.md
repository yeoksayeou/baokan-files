    For the various ideological problems in the cadre ranks, and the two-road struggle in the economic field, if we do not conduct class analysis and do not raise them to the "key link" of class struggle for earnest resolution, this is a manifestation of our county committee's failure to give prominence to politics.

    Over the years, our county has done some work and achieved some results in transforming the natural landscape and changing production conditions. However, compared with other advanced areas, the pace of progress is not fast. Of the 250,000 mu of arable land in the county, only one-third truly achieves guaranteed harvest regardless of drought or flood. Many low-yield areas still need to be further transformed. Although grain production has increased, it has only increased by an average of 3.3 percent per year. We are only making slow progress, unable to leap forward. Seventeen years have passed, and the passive situation of relying on the weather has not been overcome.

    The county committee adopted the method of "looking back, examining the roots of the disease; looking forward, using a mirror" to conduct a mass summary and inspection from top to bottom. After repeated discussions, it was unanimously agreed that the most fundamental reason was: the county committee did not give enough prominence to politics in its guiding ideology, and did not truly use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything. We did not stand high enough, and did not see far enough. The county committee did not grasp revolution to promote production. In short, the county committee's guiding ideology could not keep up with the situation, and could not continuously and correctly analyze the trends and situation of class struggle under the new circumstances.

    In the past few years, our understanding of class struggle has been insufficient. When we talked about class struggle, we thought only of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, only of their counterattacks and settling of scores, only of frontal political struggles. Of course, a clear understanding of this is very important. However, our view of class struggle was somewhat simplistic. We did not see its twists and turns and complexity, let alone recognize the class struggle in the ideological field. After the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, we also realized that there was class struggle in society. However, the understanding was not clear, and the struggle against the two kinds of thinking and the two roads was not grasped firmly or accurately. For example, in the ideological field, in recent years, county and commune cadres have had varying degrees of non-proletarian thinking: fear of hardship, fear of responsibility, fear of making mistakes. Some people in the grassroots cadres were also afraid of trouble, afraid of offending people, and afraid of suffering losses, and their work was passive. In essence, these thoughts are all about putting "self" first, and are all manifestations of the bourgeois world outlook. These things bind people's minds and limit their actions. This is the great enemy of our ideological transformation. For a period of time, the county committee did not raise these issues to the "key link" of class struggle for earnest resolution.

    In the economic field, on the issue of accumulation and distribution, we advocated distributing whatever amount production increased, and not appropriately expanding public accumulation under the conditions of increased production. In the development of sideline production, we did not actively develop collective sideline production. The sideline production of some teams was nominally collective, but actually individual; some places even took holidays to engage in sideline production. In labor management, some production teams also implemented methods of high work points, high subsidies (grain), and high allowances (money), using material incentives to encourage mass production. These all show that there is indeed a struggle between two kinds of thinking and two roads here. However, due to our low level of understanding, or being misled by phenomena, we only dealt with things as they arose. For example, in solving the problem of accumulation and distribution, we did not fully educate the masses on the policy of taking into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, but rather adopted several principles to "control" those below, and acted simply. There are many similar problems. We did not conduct class analysis, and mostly treated them as purely economic problems, and dealt with them carelessly.

    In the past few years, we have always believed in our thinking that as long as production goes up, everything will be fine. The comrades of the county committee only focused on production models when they stayed at selected spots, and did not focus on political models; although they emphasized Mao Zedong Thought in arranging political work, they could not put forward any specific content; they emphasized studying Chairman Mao's works, but they themselves did not walk in the forefront, and even lagged behind ordinary cadres. Some people criticized the county committee for concretizing production and abstracting politics. This criticism is incisive and correct.

    The tendency to neglect politics is also manifested in the fact that the county committee over-involved itself in various administrative affairs, entangling most of its energy in dealing with specific problems. By doing so, we often grasped the sesame seeds and lost the watermelon. This fully demonstrates that we are unclear in our minds and unclear about the direction.

    The county committee has even less research on Party building. Often it is an all-inclusive meeting, reciting the "one scripture" (i.e., production). When Party meetings are held, there is also more talk about production and less talk about politics. Some grassroots organizations have not conducted organizational life for a long time, have not carried out inner-Party struggle, and some places have not even developed a Party member for more than ten years, seriously affecting the发挥 of the Party organization's combat effectiveness.

    Through this preliminary inspection, we deeply realized that whether a county committee gives prominence to politics and whether it leads production with the guiding ideology of socialist large-scale agriculture is not a general issue, but an issue of direction and line. In the final analysis, it is an issue of the world outlook of the county committee leadership. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of the world outlook is a fundamental transformation." We have not yet completely completed this transformation, which is the fundamental reason for our backwardness.

    Now that the crux of the problem has been found, what should we do in the future? The county committee believes that we must "lay down the burden and start the machine," make up our minds, and catch up. The result of everyone's discussion is: first, continue to vigorously grasp ideological revolutionization. Only with ideological revolutionization will there be the revolutionization of work; only with the revolutionization of the county committee leadership will there be the revolutionization of communes, brigades, and the masses; only with a leap in understanding can there be a leap in work.

    站在阶级斗争的高度看问题
    对于干部队伍中的种种思想问题，经济领域内的两条道路斗争，不作阶级分析，不提到阶级斗争的“纲”上来认真解决，这都是我们县委不突出政治的表现。
    这些年来，我们县在改造自然面貌，改变生产条件方面，做了一些工作，也取得了一些成绩。但是和其它先进地区相比，前进的步子不快，全县二十五万亩耕地中，真正达到旱涝保收的农田只占三分之一，不少低产地，尚待继续改造。粮食产量尽管有增长，但平均每年只递增百分之三点三。只是慢步前进，不能跃进。十七年过去了，靠天吃饭的被动局面没有摆脱。
    县委采取回头看、查病根，向前看、照镜子的办法，自上而下进行了一次群众性的总结和检查，经过反复讨论，一致认为最根本的原因是：县委指导思想上突出政治不够，没有真正用毛泽东思想统帅一切。站得不高，看得不远。县委没有抓革命来促生产。总之是县委领导思想跟不上形势，不能不断地正确分析新情况下阶级斗争的动向和形势。
    前几年，我们对阶级斗争的认识是不深刻的。一说阶级斗争，就是地富反坏，就是这些人的反攻倒算，就是正面的政治斗争。当然明确认识这一点是十分重要的。但是，我们对阶级斗争的看法有些简单化，没有看到它的曲折性和复杂性，更没有认识到思想领域里的阶级斗争。党的八届十中全会以后，我们也认识到社会上有阶级斗争。可是，认识并不清楚，对两种思想、两条道路的斗争抓得不狠，抓得不准。如在意识形态上，这几年来，县、社干部中程度不同地存在着各种非无产阶级思想：怕艰苦，怕负责，怕出错误；基层干部中也有一部分人怕麻烦，怕惹人，怕吃亏，工作消极。这些思想，实质上都是“我”字当头，都是资产阶级世界观的表现。这些东西束缚着人们的头脑，限制着人们的行动。这是我们改造思想的大敌。对这些问题，县委有一个时期没有提到阶级斗争的“纲”上来认真解决。
    在经济领域内，在积累和分配问题上，主张增产多少分多少，不在增产的条件下，适当扩大公共积累。在发展副业生产上，不积极发展集体副业。有的队的副业明是集体，暗是个人；有的地方竟然放假搞副业。在劳动管理上，也有一些生产队实行高工分、高补助（粮）、高补贴（钱）的办法，用物质刺激来鼓励群众生产。这些都说明我们这里确实是存在两种思想、两条道路的斗争。但是，由于我们认识水平不高，或者被现象所迷惑，只是就事论事。例如在解决积累和分配问题上，我们不是对群众充分进行国家、集体和个人兼顾的政策教育，而是采取几条原则来“卡”下面，简单从事。类似的问题不少，我们没有进行阶级分析，多半当作单纯的经济问题，便马虎处理放过去了。
    这几年来，在我们思想上总认为：只要生产上去了，就可以“一好百好”。县委的同志蹲点，只搞生产样板，没有政治样板；布置政治工作虽然也强调毛泽东思想挂帅，却提不出什么具体内容；强调大学毛主席著作，自己却没有走在前面，甚至还落在一般干部后面。有的人批评县委是生产具体化，政治抽象化。这个批评一针见血，是正确的。
    忽视政治的倾向，还表现在县委对各种行政事务包揽过多，把大部精力都纠缠在具体问题的处理上。这样做，往往抓了芝麻，丢了西瓜。这充分表现我们头脑不清，方向不明。
    县委对党的建设更少研究。经常是一揽子会，念“一本经”（即生产），召开党的会议，也是谈生产多，谈政治少。有些基层组织，长期不过组织生活，不开展党内斗争，甚至有的地方十几年来都不发展一个党员，严重地影响党组织战斗力的发挥。
    经过这次初步检查，我们深深认识到：一个县委是否突出政治，是否以社会主义大农业的指导思想领导生产，不是一般的问题，而是一个方向性路线性的问题。归根结底，是县委领导的世界观问题。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。现在我们还没有彻底完成这个转变，这就是我们落后的根本原因。
    症结找到了，今后怎么办？县委认为必须“放下包袱，开动机器”，痛下决心，迎头赶上。大家讨论的结果是：首先继续大抓思想革命化。只有思想革命化，才会有工作的革命化；只有县委领导革命化，才会有公社、大队以及群众的革命化；只有认识上的飞跃，才能有工作的跃进。
