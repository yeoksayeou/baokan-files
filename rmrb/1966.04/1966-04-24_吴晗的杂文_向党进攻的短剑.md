    Wu Han's Essays
    —A Short Sword Attacking the Party	Hua Jian
    Since 1959, Comrade Wu Han not only "broke out of his shell" to create the historical drama "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and write numerous historical papers, but also continuously published a large number of essays. He believed that those years were an "era of essays," so he wrote profusely, with no fewer than a hundred essays included in "Collected Essays Under the Lamp," "Spring Collection," and "Study Collection." He used this "short and sharp" literary form to talk long and short, discuss the past and the present, and launched unrestrained attacks and abuse against the Party and socialism.
    If historical dramas and historical papers are Comrade Wu Han's spears for opposing the Party and socialism, then essays are the short sword at his waist.
    Judging from the content involved in Comrade Wu Han's essays, it is indeed very "miscellaneous," just as it is said, "looking left and right, wanting to touch everything" [Note]. However, "miscellaneous as it is, it does not deviate from its essence," and this "essence" is "using the past to satirize the present," launching cold arrows at the Party's leadership and socialist reality. As many comrades have already pointed out, "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor," which he wrote in June 1959 to coordinate with the right opportunists' attack on the Party, is an essay full of hostility against the Party and socialism. In fact, more than just this article, as early as two months before the publication of "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor," in another essay "Battle Formations and the Song-Liao War," he began to scold. For example, he said, "There are many reasons for losing battles, one of which is the fault of the subjectivist emperor's battle formations," and "On the contrary, those who disobey the emperor's orders without relying on battle formations may not lose battles." Here, the theme of "mocking the emperor" is already threaded through. In the essay "People and Ghosts," published in May of the same year, Comrade Wu Han again "used ghosts to satirize people," fiercely scolding so-called "living ghosts." For example: what "Although dead ghosts do not exist, living ghosts do exist," what "green faces and fangs frightening people, ghostly brains manipulating people," and also what "putting on ghostly airs, ghostly prestige," and so on. With this description, it is really a bit scary, as if Comrade Wu Han is still living in the cannibalistic old society, not in the socialist New China of the 1960s. In this essay, there is clearly a sense of "resentment," "a thorn" "wanting to prick it somewhere"!
    Comrade Wu Han's "mood" when writing these essays has been revealed. In the essay "A Proposal" he wrote at the time, he said: "Having a bone stuck in one's throat, only being able to spit it out, is passive"; the active thing is "being happy to have something to say, having to say it, having to write it," "not writing it is very uncomfortable." Under this kind of "mood," it is of course not surprising to write the above-mentioned sarcastic and allusive things.
    After the Lushan Conference in August 1959, the right opportunists' attack was repelled, so Comrade Wu Han developed a strong interest in the topics of "dismissal" and "reversal of verdicts." The historical corpses of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Zhou Chen Dismissed from Office," "Yu Qian Dismissed as Commander," "Lian Po Dismissed as Commander," "The Injustice of the Hu Lü Family," "The Injustice of Hu Wei Yong," etc., were successively brought out. At the same time, Comrade Wu Han, under the guise of protecting "new things," vehemently opposed so-called "subjectivism" and "dogmatism," and encouraged young people to establish "integrity" and bury themselves in ancient books to "get to the root of things." In an essay called "On Humility" written in the summer of 1962, he once sternly denounced those who suppressed "new forces" and fought for the legal status of so-called "heresy." He accused these people of the following crimes:
        "They are satisfied with their existing knowledge and experience, satisfied
    with the current environment. When new things appear, if they see a face
    that is unfamiliar, they either adopt a skeptical attitude, ignore it,
    pay no attention to it, or shout loudly: Where does this heresy come from!
    And beat it to death with a single blow. There are countless such examples. In the history of natural science development, there are many scientists who recognized the truth,
    and persisted in the truth, and were killed and burned by the ignorant rulers of the past.
    Their theories and works were also banned and burned."
    The title is clearly "On Humility," but suddenly it turns to the persecution of scientists. People can't help but ask: What is the inevitable connection between the two? Is it because they were not humble enough that the rulers of the past killed those scientists who insisted on the truth? Obviously not. Comrade Wu Han is using his usual technique here to elaborate on the topic. He continued: "But people can be executed, books can be burned, but truth cannot be killed or burned. Not only does it continue to be passed down, but it also shines brighter and brighter." It turns out that what he is talking about is not the issue of humility or lack thereof, but the same tune as what is sung in "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Hai Rui dismissed from office, his name is fragrant," "Plotting to overthrow is not right," which is still to reverse the verdicts, complain, and redress the grievances for those so-called "wronged and harmed" right-leaning opportunists who were "dismissed" from "office." Except that he replaced "Hai Rui" with "heretical scientists," thereby even more viciously insinuating that the Party is the "religious court" of the Middle Ages.
    What kind of practice there is, there will inevitably be what kind of theory. Just as Comrade Wu Han wrote several articles discussing historical dramas in coordination with the emergence of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and "Li Hui Niang," in order to establish a bit of "theoretical" basis for their essays, so as to further expand their "free market," Comrade Wu Han threw out another essay entitled "Write More Essays" in June 1962. In this essay, Comrade Wu Han, posing as a successor of Mr. Lu Xun, loudly appealed, calling on writers to "grasp the problem," "prescribe the right medicine," and "write more essays," and also brought out the notorious "theory" of "still the era of essays, still Lu Xun's style" from more than twenty years ago. In this article, he first raised a question under the guise of a pretext, saying:
        "I don't know according to what theory, it seems some people say that now is not the era of essays.
        Why can't our era have essays?
        I think, not only can we have them, but we should write more."
    Why should we "write more" essays? His explanation is: because we need to "carry out criticism and self-criticism." But this need has not been met: "After an essay is published, this one raises an opinion, that one is busy defending, and another thinks the author is intentionally slandering. As a result, the essay is strangled." Everyone knows that no one has ever advocated that criticism and self-criticism should be done in the style of essays. Moreover, since criticism and self-criticism are advocated, it is of course necessary to allow others to criticize back. There has never been a situation where criticism and self-criticism have been "strangled" because of different opinions. "Essays" have no necessary connection with "criticism and self-criticism." The criticism and self-criticism that Comrade Wu Han is talking about here is just a smokescreen, used to conceal the ulterior motives he wants to achieve with essays.
    Originally, there was already a conclusion about the "theory" of so-called "still the era of essays." In May 1942, Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" thoroughly criticized the anti-Party elements Wang Shiwei, Ding Ling, Xiao Jun, and Luo Feng, the inventors of this "theory." Chairman Mao pointed out at the time that this was a "political" issue. He said: "In the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the anti-Japanese base areas behind enemy lines, which give revolutionary artists full democratic freedom, but only do not give democratic freedom to counter-revolutionaries, the form of essays should not be simply the same as Lu Xun's. We can cry out loudly, instead of being obscure and tortuous, making it difficult for the masses of the people to understand. If it is not for the enemies of the people, but for the people themselves, then Lu Xun of the 'era of essays' never ridiculed and attacked the revolutionary people and revolutionary parties, and the writing style of essays is completely different from that for the enemies." In March 1957, Chairman Mao's "Speech at the National Conference on Propaganda Work of the Communist Party of China" once again pointed out: "Can Lu Xun-style essays be used to deal with the errors and shortcomings within the people? I think so. Of course, it is necessary to distinguish between ourselves and the enemy, and not to stand on a hostile position and treat comrades with the attitude of treating enemies. It must be full of enthusiasm to speak with the attitude of protecting the people's cause and raising the people's awareness, and not to speak with the attitude of ridicule and attack." In these two "speeches," Chairman Mao had already explained clearly what is the "era of essays" and what is "Lu Xun-style essays." This scientific conclusion revealed the essence of the problem, hindering the hands and feet of some people who attempted to engage in anti-Party and anti-people activities under the guise of Mr. Lu Xun's name, so they developed extreme hatred for Chairman Mao's great historical document. Therefore, whenever the situation of class struggle becomes sharp, there are always some people with ulterior motives who repeatedly propose "still the era of essays" and "still Lu Xun's style" to confront Mao Zedong Thought. And Comrade Wu Han happened to raise this issue again when the national literary and art circles were jubilantly commemorating the twentieth anniversary of the publication of "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," and also asked indignantly "I don't know according to what theory, it seems some people say that now is not the era of essays," what is the target if not Mao Zedong Thought?
    Comrade Wu Han should know that the term "era of essays" has become synonymous with the "dark age" in the history of literary struggle. It and essays were originally two different concepts; advocating writing more essays and saying that our socialist society where the people are the masters today is the "era of essays" are completely two different things. In fact, the creation of essays has not been neglected since liberation. Revolutionary literary and art workers have used it to attack the enemy, "protect the people's cause, and improve the people's awareness" in the three major revolutionary movements, which has played a significant role. Of course, in the eyes of Wu Han and others, these cannot be considered essays, because the "essays" they want are anti-Party and anti-socialist, so they have proposed what "now" is "the era of essays," etc.
    Speaking of this, Comrade Wu Han may argue: I also said "our era is not Lu Xun's era," so we must "treat differently," and "our struggle target is against the errors and shortcomings in our own work," it is just "criticism and self-criticism."
    However, facts speak louder than words. Although Comrade Wu Han did say things like "treat differently," his many essays to reverse the verdicts and appeal for the right-leaning opportunists forcefully proved that he was not conducting any well-intentioned "self-criticism" to the Party's leadership and the revolutionary people, but malicious slander. Many historical experiences tell us that under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, people with ulterior motives often always launch attacks on the revolution in the guise of "self-criticism" within the revolutionary camp. Comrade Wu Han's essay theory and creation practice once again illustrate this point.
    Speaking of "reversing verdicts," "Write More Essays" itself is an article to reverse verdicts. Isn't it, after twenty years have passed, he picked up the "still the era of essays" weapon, which had already been used to tatters by anti-Party elements and rightists, from the historical garbage heap again, and found various reasons to advocate it. Isn't this precisely to reverse the verdict for this kind of "theory"? This, in addition to showing that Comrade Wu Han had become "addicted" to "reversing verdicts" in those years, also shows that the poisonous weeds in the cultural and academic garden, whether new or old, are all plants on the same vine, so their "theories" can also be mutually used.
    It is said that history cannot be repeated, but some people who want to violate the laws of social development and pull history backward insist on repeatedly playing the roles in history that have been spurned by the people. For such people, we have no choice but to return to Comrade Wu Han the sentence in his essay on "living ghosts," that is:
    "Shout loudly: You are a ghost! Expose him, so that everyone knows, this is a ghost!"

    吴晗的杂文
    ——向党进攻的短剑	华　健
    从一九五九年以来，吴晗同志不仅“破门而出”创作了历史剧《海瑞罢官》，写了许多篇历史论文，而且连续发表了大量的杂文。他认为那几年是个“杂文的时代”，所以大写特写，其中收入《灯下集》《春天集》《学习集》的就不下百篇。他利用这种“短小犀利”的文体，说长道短、谈古论今，对党对社会主义进行了恣意的攻击和谩骂。
    如果说历史剧和历史论文是吴晗同志反党反社会主义的长矛，那末，杂文就是他腰中的短剑。
    就吴晗同志的杂文所涉及的内容来看，的确是很“杂”的，正所谓“左顾右盼，什么都想摸一下”〔注〕，但是“杂虽杂，也还不离其宗”，这个“宗”就是“借古非今”，对党的领导对社会主义现实放冷箭。正如许多同志已经指出的，他在一九五九年六月，配合右倾机会主义分子对党发动进攻所写的《海瑞骂皇帝》，就是一篇充满了敌意的反党反社会主义的杂文。其实何止此篇，早在《海瑞骂皇帝》发表的前两个月，在另一篇杂文《阵图和宋辽战争》中，就开始骂起来了。如他说：“打败仗的原因很多，其中之一是主观主义皇帝所制阵图的罪过”，“相反，不凭阵图违背皇帝命令的倒可以不打败仗”，这里就已经贯穿了“骂皇帝”的主题。在同年五月发表的题为《人和鬼》的杂文里，吴晗同志又“借鬼讽人”，大骂所谓“活鬼”。例如：什么“死鬼虽然不存在，活鬼却确实有之”啦，什么“青面獠牙吓唬人，鬼头鬼脑的摆弄人”啦，还有什么“摆出鬼架子、鬼威风”啦，等等。经这一形容，真有点可怕，似乎吴晗同志仍然生活在人吃人的旧社会，而不是生活在二十世纪六十年代的社会主义的新中国。在这篇杂文里分明有股子“恨气”，“有根刺”“想朝什么地方戳它一下”！
    吴晗同志写这些杂文时的“心情”是披露过的。他在当时写的《一个倡议》的杂文里就说过：“骨鲠在喉，非吐不可是消极的”；积极的则是“高兴得有话想说，非说不可，非写不可”，“不写，很难受”。在这种“心情”之下，写出了上述那样冷嘲热讽，指桑骂槐的东西，当然是不足为怪的了。
    一九五九年八月庐山会议以后，右倾机会主义分子的进攻被打退了，于是吴晗同志对“罢官”和“翻案”的题目发生了浓厚的兴趣。什么“海瑞罢官”“周忱罢官”“于谦罢帅”“廉颇罢帅”“斛律全家族的冤案”“胡惟庸的冤案”等等历史的僵尸，都陆续地搬了出来。与此同时，吴晗同志还以保护“新生事物”的面目，大反起所谓“主观主义”和“教条主义”，鼓励青年们树立“骨气”，埋头古籍去“寻根问底”。他在一九六二年夏天所写的一篇叫做《说谦虚》的杂文中，就曾经声色俱厉地指斥那些压制“新生力量”的人，并为所谓“异端”争取合法地位。他指控这些人的罪状是：
        “他们满足于已有的知识、经验，满足
    于当前的环境，对新生事物的出现，一看脸
    孔蓦生，不是采取怀疑的态度，不加理睬、
    不去注意，就是大喝一声：哪里来的异端！
    一棍子打死。这样的例子不胜举，在自然科
    学发展的历史中，有不少科学家认识了真理，
    并且坚持了真理，结果被过去愚昧的统治者
    杀死、烧死，他们的学说、著作也被禁止、
    焚毁。”题目明明是《说谦虚》，忽然一下子又转到迫害科学家上面去了。人们不禁要问：这二者有什么必然的联系呢？难道过去的统治者杀害那些坚持真理的科学家，就是由于他们态度不够谦虚吗？显然不是。吴晗同志在这里使用他惯用的手法在借题发挥。他接下去说：“但是，人可以被处死，书可以被烧毁，真理是杀不死、烧不坏的，不但一直流传下来，而且愈来愈发出灿烂的光辉。”原来他说的根本就不是谦虚不谦虚的问题，而是和《海瑞罢官》里所唱的什么“海瑞罢官姓名香”、“阴谋倾陷理不当”是同样的调子，仍是在为那些所谓“蒙冤受害”、被“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子翻案、叫屈、鸣不平。只不过他又把“海瑞”换上了“异端科学家”，因而也就更加恶毒地把党影射成中世纪的“宗教裁判所”了。
    有什么样的实践就必然有什么样的理论。——正象配合《海瑞罢官》、《李慧娘》的出笼，吴晗同志曾经先后写了好几篇谈论历史剧的文章一样，为了给他们的杂文建立一点“理论”根据，以便进一步扩大他们的“自由市场”，吴晗同志在一九六二年六月又抛出了一篇题为《多写一点杂文》的杂文。在这篇杂文中，吴晗同志俨然以鲁迅先生继承者的姿态大声疾呼，号召作家们“抓住问题”“对症下药”“多写一些杂文”，并且把二十多年前臭名昭著的所谓“还是杂文时代，还要鲁迅笔法”的“理论”，又搬了出来。他在这篇文章中首先假借了一个由头提出质问说：
        “不知根据什么理论，似乎有人说，而今不是杂文的时代。
        为什么我们这个时代不可以有杂文呢？
        我看，不但可以有，还应该多写才是。”
    为什么要“多写”杂文呢？他的解释是：因为我们需要“展开批评与自我批评”。但是，这种需要却没有得到满足：“一篇杂文发表了，这个提意见，那个忙于辩解，另一个则认为作者有意中伤，这样做的结果，杂文被扼杀了。”大家都知道，谁也没有提倡过批评和自我批评要用杂文笔法。而且，既然提倡批评和自我批评，当然也就要允许别人的反批评，从来没有出现过因为有不同意见，就“扼杀”了批评和自我批评。“杂文”同“批评和自我批评”没有必然的联系。吴晗同志这里所谈的批评和自我批评，只不过是一个幌子，借以掩藏他要用杂文达到的不可告人的目的。
    本来，关于所谓“还是杂文时代”的“理论”，早已有了定论。一九四二年五月毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》中，就曾经针对着这种“理论”的发明者反党分子王实味、丁玲、萧军、罗烽之流，进行过彻底的批驳。毛主席在当时就指出，这是“政治方面”的问题。他说：“在给革命文艺家以充分民主自由、仅仅不给反革命分子以民主自由的陕甘宁边区和敌后的各抗日根据地，杂文形式就不应该简单地和鲁迅的一样。我们可以大声疾呼，而不要隐晦曲折，使人民大众不易看懂。如果不是对于人民的敌人，而是对于人民自己，那末，‘杂文时代’的鲁迅，也不曾嘲笑和攻击革命人民和革命政党，杂文的写法也和对于敌人的完全两样。”一九五七年三月，毛主席《在中国共产党全国宣传工作会议上的讲话》再一次指出：“鲁迅式的杂文可不可以用来对付人民内部的错误和缺点呢？我看也可以。当然要分清敌我，不能站在敌对的立场用对待敌人的态度来对待同志。必须是满腔热情地用保护人民事业和提高人民觉悟的态度来说话，而不能用嘲笑和攻击的态度来说话。”毛主席在这两个“讲话”中，早已把什么是“杂文的时代”，什么是“鲁迅式的杂文”的问题，说得清清楚楚了。这种科学的论断，揭破了问题的实质，妨碍了某些企图假借鲁迅先生的名义，进行反党反人民活动的人的手脚，所以他们就对毛主席这部伟大的历史文献，产生了极端的仇视。因此，每当阶级斗争形势尖锐起来的时候，总有一些别有用心的人，一再地提出“还是杂文的时代”、“还是鲁迅的笔法”，来和毛泽东思想相对抗。而吴晗同志恰恰是在全国文艺界欢欣鼓舞纪念《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表二十周年的时候，又重新提出这个问题，还悻悻然地质问“不知根据什么理论，似乎有人说，而今不是杂文的时代”，矛头不是指向毛泽东思想又是什么呢？
    吴晗同志应该知道，“杂文的时代”这个词儿在文艺斗争史上已经成为“黑暗时代”的同义语了，它和杂文原本是两个不同的概念；提倡多写一点杂文和把我们今天人民当家做主的社会主义社会说成是“杂文的时代”，完全是两回事。事实上，解放以来杂文的创作并不冷落，革命的文艺工作者在三大革命运动中，利用它打击敌人、“保护人民事业，提高人民觉悟”，曾起过显著的作用。当然，在吴晗等人看来这些都不能算杂文，因为他们所要的“杂文”是反党、反社会主义的，所以他们才又提出什么“而今”是“杂文的时代”云云。 
    说到这里，吴晗同志可能要辩解：我也说过“我们的时代不是鲁迅的时代”，因而要“区别对待”呀，“我们斗争的对象是针对自己工作中的错误和缺点”呀，只不过是“批评与自我批评”呀。
    然而，事实胜于雄辩。尽管吴晗同志确曾说过“区别对待”一类的话，但他那许多篇为右倾机会主义分子翻案呼冤的杂文作品，却有力地证明了他对党的领导对革命的人民，不是进行什么善意的“自我批评”，而是恶意的中伤。许多的历史经验告诉我们，在无产阶级专政的条件下，别有用心的人，往往总是以冒充革命阵营内部“自我批评”的姿态来对革命进行袭击的。吴晗同志的杂文理论和创作实践，再一次说明了这一点。
    说到“翻案”，《多写一点杂文》本身就是一篇翻案文章。不是吗，已经时过二十年，又从历史的垃圾堆里，把那早已被反党分子、右派分子使用得破烂不堪的“还是杂文的时代”的武器重新捡了起来，找出种种理由加以提倡，这不正是要为这种“理论”翻案吗？这一点除了表明吴晗同志在那几年已经“翻案”成“癖”，同时也说明文化学术园地里的毒草，不管新的还是老的，本都是一条蔓上的植物，所以，它们的“理论”也是可以互相通用的。
    按说，历史是不能重复的，但是，有一些妄想违背社会发展规律，拉着历史倒退的人，偏偏要重复地去扮演历史上已被人民唾弃了的角色。对于这样的人，我们只好用吴晗同志谈论“活鬼”的那篇杂文中的一句话，再还敬给吴晗同志，那就是：
    “大喝一声：你是鬼！揭穿他，让人人都知道，这是鬼！”
