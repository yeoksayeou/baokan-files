    Guiyang Manufactures Storage Battery Handheld Signal Lantern
    This signal lantern uses a small storage battery as its power source, making it lightweight, convenient, and safe.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang) A new type of handheld signal lantern for railway transportation operations has recently been successfully trial-produced in Guiyang. This new lantern is called the micro-storage battery handheld signal lantern. In railway departments, personnel responsible for receiving and dispatching trains and performing shunting operations at night must use handheld signal lanterns. Since the inception of railways in China, oil-burning handheld signal lanterns have been used. Although these oil lamps have undergone significant improvements since liberation, they still require the consumption of large quantities of vegetable oil, and the visible distance is relatively short.
    The newly manufactured micro-storage battery handheld signal lantern features an aluminum structure, uses a small storage battery with a plastic casing as its power source, making it lightweight, convenient, and safe to use, and impervious to wind and rain. Additionally, because the lamp head is equipped with reflective, magnifying, and focusing devices, the visible distance is relatively long, reaching over 1,200 meters.

    贵阳制成蓄电池手提信号灯
    这种信号灯以小蓄电池为电源，使用轻便安全
    据新华社贵阳电　供铁路运输作业使用的一种新式手提信号灯，最近在贵阳试制成功。这种新灯叫微蓄电池手提信号灯。在铁路部门，夜间接发列车和进行调车作业的人员，都要用手提信号灯。我国自有铁路以来，一直都是使用油灯手提信号灯。解放以来，这种油灯虽然有了很大改进，但是仍然需要耗用大量植物油，而且显示距离也较近。
    新制成的微蓄电池手提信号灯，灯身采用铝质结构，以塑料外壳的小蓄电池作为电源，使用起来轻便安全，不怕风雨，同时由于灯头设有反光、放大和聚光装置，显示距离也比较远，能达到一千二百米以上。
