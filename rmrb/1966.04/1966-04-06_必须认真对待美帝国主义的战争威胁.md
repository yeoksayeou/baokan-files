    On April 5th, the spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs was instructed to issue the 400th serious warning regarding the U.S. aggression of violating our territorial waters and airspace. This is a debt of crime owed to the Chinese people by U.S. imperialism that must be settled, an undeniable ironclad proof of U.S. imperialism’s aggression against China and its threat to peace in Asia and the world.

    For a long time, U.S. imperialism has continuously dispatched its warships and aircraft to violate China’s territorial waters and airspace, carrying out blatant military provocations against China. This has become a daily routine for the U.S. military authorities. In the seven years since the Chinese government issued its first serious warning in September 1958, a cumulative total of 443 U.S. warships have violated our territorial waters, totaling 361 instances; a cumulative total of 487 U.S. aircraft have violated our airspace, totaling 314 instances. It is rare in the history of international relations for one country to conduct such prolonged, planned military provocations against another sovereign nation. Moreover, these provocations have intensified year by year, becoming more frequent and expanding in scope. The facts clearly tell us that U.S. imperialism is determined to be an enemy of the Chinese people to the end, and it is constantly threatening China with war.

    While the Johnson administration is massively increasing its troop deployments in South Vietnam and intensifying its war of aggression against Vietnam, military and political leaders in Washington and American newspapers are not only gnashing their teeth and cursing China, but are also openly clamoring for a showdown with China. We must analyze the war cries of U.S. imperialism. Some are in the nature of intimidation. They believe that as long as they shout loudly and spread a little gunpowder, the Chinese people will be frightened into "closing the door and ignoring the moon before the window, leaving the plum blossoms to bloom as they please." Others really want to take action and are preparing to launch a war of aggression against China.

    Recently, the U.S. ruling clique has released a gust of wind, saying that they want to "improve" Sino-U.S. relations and adopt a "flexible policy" towards China. However, the Chinese people will never be deceived. With U.S. imperialism persisting in occupying China's territory of Taiwan Province, deploying troops in the Taiwan Strait, and carrying out such rampant military provocations against the Chinese mainland, it is quite obvious that the U.S. ruling clique is playing its counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, attempting to paralyze the Chinese people's fighting spirit and relax their war preparedness.

    The Chinese people have seen through the aggressive and bellicose nature of U.S. imperialism and have never harbored any illusions about it. U.S. imperialism is unwilling to accept the collapse of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary dynasty, nor is it willing to accept that its aggressive forces have been completely, thoroughly, and cleanly driven out of mainland China. Therefore, less than a year after the founding of the People's Republic of China, U.S. imperialism launched the war of aggression against Korea and forcibly occupied China's territory of Taiwan Province. Subsequently, the aggressive forces of U.S. imperialism entered Indochina, replacing the French colonialists in South Vietnam and Laos. U.S. imperialism has also intensified its military deployments around China year after year, establishing a so-called "crescent arc" encirclement in Asia and the Pacific region, stretching from South Korea through Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam, Thailand, "Malaysia," and even India. The military deployments and aggressive activities of U.S. imperialism in Asia and the Pacific region, in addition to suppressing the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various Asian countries, are also in preparation for launching a war of aggression against China.

    At present, U.S. imperialism is gradually shifting the focus of its "global strategy" from Europe to Asia and the Pacific region. The U.S. military forces currently deployed in Asia and the Pacific region, including land, sea, and air forces, have exceeded its forces in Europe and the Atlantic region. U.S. imperialism has placed so much military force in Asia and the Pacific region, of course, not as a game, but as a major strategic deployment, preparing to launch a larger-scale war of aggression in Asia.

    China is a great revolutionary country. Domestically, the Chinese people adhere to socialist revolution and socialist construction, and externally, they resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of all oppressed peoples and oppressed nations. Precisely because of this, U.S. imperialism regards China as the main obstacle to its pursuit of its policy of aggression and war in Asia and the implementation of its "global strategy" throughout the world. In the eyes of U.S. imperialism, there are only a few ways to destroy revolutionary China: First, to carry out military threats to force China to submit. This has already proven to be unworkable. Second, to hope for "peaceful evolution" in China. This is also a complete delusion. Third, to have a real fight with China. The facts are increasingly showing that U.S. imperialism is preparing to impose war on the Chinese people.

    After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan and on the eve of the Kuomintang reactionaries launching a counter-revolutionary civil war, Comrade Mao Zedong taught the Chinese people: "Chiang Kai-shek is already sharpening his knife, therefore, we must also sharpen our knife." Today, we adopt the same approach to the war threat of U.S. imperialism and treat it seriously. The Chinese people must make all war preparations without the slightest relaxation. We are not the chief of staff of U.S. imperialism. It is they who want to fight, not us. Therefore, we must prepare for both a late war and, even more so, an early war; we must prepare for both a small war and, even more so, a big war. The so-called early war means fighting this year or next year. The so-called big war means U.S. imperialism launching all-out attacks, sending millions or even tens of millions of troops to China. China has an area of more than 9.5 million square kilometers and a population of 650 million. We have the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the invincible People's Liberation Army, and militia divisions all over the country. On such a vast battlefield in China, U.S. imperialism can show off as much strength as it has capital. The Chinese people love peace. However, if U.S. imperialism insists on launching a war against China, then our attitude is to accompany them to the end.

    The Chinese people and U.S. imperialism are not strangers. One does not know the other without a fight. The Chinese people have figured out the details of U.S. imperialism. In fact, we have already crossed swords with U.S. imperialism twice since World War II. The first time was from 1946 to 1949. Comrade Mao Zedong once said that the Chinese civil war in those years was "superficially Chiang Kai-shek's war, but actually a war of U.S. aggression against the Chinese people," "this was a war in which the United States provided money and guns, and Chiang Kai-shek provided the manpower to fight for the United States and kill the Chinese people." This war ended with the complete defeat of the Chiang Kai-shek clique, that is, the complete defeat of U.S. imperialism. The second time was the Korean War from 1950 to 1953. The Chinese People's Volunteers and the Korean People's Army fought shoulder to shoulder with U.S. imperialism, forcing U.S. imperialism to lower its head and forcing it to sign an armistice agreement in Panmunjom. Now, U.S. imperialism is once again baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, full of bluster, but in fact it is nothing to be afraid of. The most fundamental point is that we are just, and U.S. imperialism is unjust. Moreover, U.S. imperialism has great ambitions but limited capital. It wants to dominate the world, spreading its ten fingers so wide, dispersing its strength so much, stretching its battle lines so long, and its rear is so far away. Never in history has an aggressor deployed its troops in this way. At first glance, U.S. imperialism is showing off a posture of encompassing the four seas and annexing the eight directions, but in reality, it is a posture of being passively beaten. Whenever there is a disturbance in the world, U.S. imperialism is startled and restless. If several anti-American storms break out at the same time, it will be in a state of being stretched thin and struggling to cope. Today's U.S. imperialism is not stronger than it was more than a decade ago, but weaker. As for our China, it is not weaker than it was more than a decade ago, but stronger.

    If U.S. imperialism wants to attack China, whether it is testing the waters or launching a full-scale attack, the result can only be one: no return. The Chinese people are always prepared for a sudden attack that U.S. imperialism may launch. As long as U.S. imperialism has not died, then not only our generation must be prepared, but our second and third generations must still be prepared. The sharp opposition and fierce struggle between revolutionary China and U.S. imperialism, which is constantly expanding its aggression and war, is the inevitable result of historical development. This struggle will run through an entire historical era. Spokesmen for U.S. imperialism have clamored that the United States needs thirty years to deal with China. We frankly answer him: the Chinese people, with their great revolutionary spirit, are determined to fight U.S. imperialism for one hundred, two hundred, or even three hundred years, until U.S. imperialism is completely overthrown and the world revolution achieves complete victory!

### 必须认真对待美帝国主义的战争威胁

    必须认真对待美帝国主义的战争威胁
    四月五日，我国外交部发言人奉命对美国侵犯我领海领空的侵略罪行提出第四百次严重警告。这是美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的一笔必须清算的罪债，是美帝国主义侵略中国、威胁亚洲和世界和平的一个不容抵赖的铁证。
    长期以来，美帝国主义连续不停地派遣它的军舰和飞机侵犯中国的领海和领空，对中国进行明目张胆的军事挑衅。这已经成为美国军事当局的一项日常事务了。从一九五八年九月中国政府发出第一次严重警告以后的七年多时间内，侵犯我领海的美国军舰累计达到四百四十三艘，共计三百六十一次；侵犯我领空的美国飞机累计达到四百八十七架，共计三百一十四次。一个国家对另一个主权国家进行这样长期的、有计划的军事挑衅，这在国际关系史上是罕见的。而且这种挑衅，一年比一年加剧，一年比一年频繁，一年比一年扩大。事实清楚地告诉我们，美帝国主义是要同中国人民为敌到底的，它无时无刻地不在对中国进行着战争威胁。
    在约翰逊政府大举增兵南越，加紧扩大侵越战争的同时，华盛顿的军政头目和美国报刊，不仅咬牙切齿地诅咒中国，而且公然鼓吹要同中国较量一番。对于美帝国主义的战争叫嚣，要有分析。一类是属于恫吓性质的。他们以为只要大叫大嚷一通，散布一点火药味，中国人民就会被吓倒，从此“闭门不管窗前月，分付梅花自主张”。另一类则确实想动手动脚，准备对中国发动侵略战争。
    最近，美国统治集团又放出一股风来，说什么他们要“改善”中美关系了，要对中国采取“灵活政策”了。但是，中国人民是决不会受骗的。在美帝国主义坚持霸占中国领土台湾省，陈兵台湾海峡，并对中国大陆进行这样猖狂的军事挑衅的情况下，美国统治集团放出一点“亲善”的空气来，这十分明显地是在玩弄它的反革命两手策略，企图麻痹中国人民的斗志，松懈中国人民的战备。
    对于美帝国主义的侵略和好战的本性，中国人民是看透了的，是从来不抱任何幻想的。美帝国主义对于蒋介石反动王朝的覆灭是不甘心的，对于它的侵略势力被全部、彻底、干净地赶出中国大陆也是不甘心的。因此，中华人民共和国成立不到一年，美帝国主义便发动了侵朝战争，并武装霸占中国的领土台湾省。接着，美帝国主义的侵略势力又进入印度支那，取代了法国殖民者在南越和老挝的地位。美帝国主义还年甚一年地在中国周围加紧进行军事部署，在亚洲和太平洋地区建立了一个从南朝鲜经过日本、台湾、菲律宾、南越、泰国、“马来西亚”直到印度的所谓“新月形弧线”的包围圈。美帝国主义在亚洲和太平洋地区的军事部署和侵略活动，除了为镇压亚洲各国人民的革命运动之外，也是为了准备对中国发动侵略战争。
    目前，美帝国主义正在把它的“全球战略”重点由欧洲逐步地转移到了亚洲和太平洋地区。美国目前部署在亚洲和太平洋地区的陆、海、空军，已超过了它在欧洲和大西洋地区的力量。美帝国主义把这么多的军事力量放在亚洲和太平洋地区，当然不是为了儿戏，而是一个重大的战略部署，准备在亚洲发动一场更大规模的侵略战争。
    中国是个伟大的革命国家。中国人民对内坚持社会主义革命和社会主义建设，对外坚决支持一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命斗争。正是因为这样，美帝国主义把中国当作它在亚洲推行侵略政策和战争政策，在全世界实现“全球战略”的主要障碍。在美帝国主义看来，要摧毁革命的中国，无非是这么几个办法：一是进行军事威胁，迫使中国屈服。这一点已经证明是行不通的。二是指望中国“和平演变”。这也完全是个妄想。三是真刀真枪地同中国大干一场。事实越来越明显地表明，美帝国主义正在准备把战争强加在中国人民头上。
    在抗日战争胜利后、国民党反动派发动反革命内战的前夕，毛泽东同志曾这样教导中国人民：“蒋介石已经在磨刀了，因此，我们也要磨刀。”今天，对于美帝国主义的战争威胁，我们也采取同样的方针，予以认真对待。中国人民必须毫不松懈地做好一切战备工作。我们不是美帝国主义的参谋长。是它要打而不是我们要打。因此，我们既要准备它迟打，更要准备它早打；既要准备它小打，更要准备它大打。所谓早打，就是今年打或者明年打。所谓大打，就是美帝国主义倾巢出动，开上几百万甚至上千万的军队到中国来。中国的面积有九百五十多万平方公里，人口有六亿五千万。我们有以毛泽东同志为首的党中央的英明领导，有战无不胜的人民解放军，有遍布全国的民兵师。在中国这样一个广阔的战场上，美帝国主义有多大的本钱，就请它摆多大的阵势。中国人民是爱好和平的。但是，如果美帝国主义硬要对中国发动战争，那末，我们的态度是奉陪到底。
    中国人民同美帝国主义，并非是初交。不打不相识，对于美帝国主义的底细，中国人民是摸透了的。事实上，在第二次世界大战以后，我们已经同美帝国主义两度交手。第一次是一九四六年到一九四九年。毛泽东同志曾经说过，那几年的中国内战，“表面上是蒋介石实际上是美国进攻中国人民的战争”，“这就是美国出钱出枪蒋介石出人替美国打仗杀中国人的战争”。这次战争，以蒋介石集团的彻底失败，也就是美帝国主义的彻底失败而告终。第二次是一九五○年到一九五三年的朝鲜战争。中国人民志愿军和朝鲜人民军肩并肩地同美帝国主义面对面较量过，打得美帝国主义低下了头，迫使它在板门店签订了停战协定。现在，美帝国主义又张牙舞爪，气势汹汹，其实并没有什么了不起。最根本之点，我们是正义的，美帝国主义是非正义的。而且，美帝国主义野心很大，本钱有限。它要称霸全球，十个指头摊得那么开，力量分得那么散，战线拉得那么长，后方离得那么远。有史以来，从来没有一个侵略者，是这样部署军队的。乍看之下，美帝国主义摆的是一副囊括四海、并吞八方的架势，实际上，这是一副被动挨打的架势。世界上一有风吹草动，美帝国主义就心惊肉跳，坐卧不安。如果同时爆发几个反美风暴，它就处于捉襟见肘、穷于应付的状态。今天的美帝国主义比之十多年以前，不是更强，而是更弱了。至于我们中国，比之十多年以前，不是更弱，而是更强了。
    美帝国主义如果要进攻中国，不论是小试锋芒，或是大打出手，结果只能是一个：有来无回。对于美帝国主义可能发动的突然袭击，中国人民是时刻准备着的。只要美帝国主义还没有死亡，那么，不仅我们这一代要准备着，我们的第二代、第三代，仍然要准备着。革命的中国同不断扩大侵略和战争的美帝国主义之间的尖锐对立和激烈斗争，是历史发展的必然结果。这一斗争，将贯穿着一整个历史时代。美帝国主义的代言人曾经叫嚷，美国需要用三十年的时间来对付中国。我们坦率地回答他：有着伟大的革命气魄的中国人民，决心同美帝国主义斗争一百年、二百年，甚至三百年，直到美帝国主义被彻底打倒，世界革命取得彻底胜利为止！
