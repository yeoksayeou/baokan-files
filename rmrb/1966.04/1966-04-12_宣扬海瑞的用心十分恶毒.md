    Publicizing Hai Rui is Extremely Malicious
    Worker of Dalian Glassware Factory, Huo Zhongkun
    Comrade Wu Han is extremely enthusiastic about Hai Rui, and frantically publicizes Hai Rui in various forms.
    In Comrade Wu Han's writing, Hai Rui, an official of the feudal ruling class, has turned into a "Hai Qingtian" who "built water conservancy projects," "returned land," and "redressed unjust verdicts" for the people, and was deeply loved by the people. When he was dismissed from office, the people still prostrated themselves and sang the praises of "Father Hai cannot be kept when he returns south, ten thousand families burn incense to the living Buddha."
    Chairman Mao has long taught us: "In class society, everyone lives in a definite class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with the mark of a class." May I ask, how can Hai Rui, such a filial son and virtuous grandson who opens his mouth with "the three-foot royal law" and closes his mouth with "sharing the worries for the emperor," and wholeheartedly safeguards the interests of the feudal landlord class, be as Comrade Wu Han publicizes, "thinking of the people in everything," and be the "savior of the oppressed, bullied, and wronged people"? Obviously impossible. This can only be Comrade Wu Han's fabrication, with ulterior motives.
    Around 1960, our country was in a period of temporary difficulties. Foreign imperialism and modern revisionism jointly staged an anti-China chorus. Domestic class enemies unscrupulously and insidiously launched attacks on the socialist system. At a time of exceptionally sharp and complex class struggle, should people follow the Party and rely on the principle of self-reliance and hard work to overcome natural disasters and defend the socialist system, or should they waver in the socialist cause, or even slander our Party and country together with demons and monsters, and attack our socialist system? This is a matter of principle involving right and wrong, and a serious test for everyone.
    Comrade Wu Han was precisely at this time that he was unwilling to remain silent and vigorously promoted the so-called Hai Rui spirit of daring to "scold the emperor." He not only echoed some demons and monsters at the time, cooperating with them to launch rampant attacks on the socialist system, but also directly sympathized with and supported the right opportunists who had been dismissed from office at the time, encouraging them to learn from the Hai Rui spirit, "not yielding to the strong, not being frightened by failure, and trying again after failure." Therefore, his "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a poisonous weed that attacks the Party and socialism by using the past to criticize the present, and must be eradicated.
    However, after the public exposure and criticism of Comrade Wu Han's mistakes in the newspapers, Comrade Wu Han lied and said that my writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was entirely "writing a play for the sake of writing a play," and the purpose "did not occur to me at all." This kind of sophistry can only be a cover-up. We do not believe Comrade Wu Han's lies, and hope that he can bring out the unspeakable things deep in his heart and see the sunlight.

    宣扬海瑞的用心十分恶毒
    旅大玻璃制品厂工人　霍忠坤
    吴晗同志非常热中于海瑞，利用各种形式狂热地宣扬海瑞。
    在吴晗同志的笔下，一个封建统治阶级的官吏海瑞，竟变成了为人民“兴修水利”、“退田”、“平冤狱”，做了许多好事的“海青天”，深受百姓的爱戴。当他被罢官离任时，人民还是顶礼膜拜，唱出了“海父南归留不住，万家生佛把香烧”的赞歌。
    毛泽东同志早就教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”试问，象海瑞这样一个开口“三尺皇家法”，闭口“为皇上分忧”，死心塌地维护封建地主阶级利益的孝子贤孙，怎么会如吴晗同志所宣扬的“处处事事为百姓设想”，是“被压抑、被欺负、被冤屈人们的救星”呢？显然是不可能的，这只能是吴晗同志的臆造，是别有用心的。
    一九六○年前后，我国正处在暂时的困难时期，国外帝国主义和现代修正主义一道演出了反华大合唱，国内的阶级敌人不择手段，无孔不入地向社会主义制度发动进攻。在阶级斗争异常尖锐复杂的时刻，人们是跟着党，依靠自力更生、奋发图强的方针，战胜自然灾害，保卫社会主义制度呢，还是对社会主义大业表示动摇，甚至和牛鬼蛇神一道污蔑我们的党和国家，向我们的社会主义制度进攻？这是大是大非的原则问题，是对每一个人的严重考验。
    吴晗同志正是在这个时期不甘沉默，大肆宣扬所谓敢于“骂皇帝”的海瑞精神。他不仅与当时的一些牛鬼蛇神相呼应，配合他们向社会主义制度猖狂进攻，而且更直接同情、支持当时被罢了官的右倾机会主义分子，鼓励他们学习海瑞精神，“不为强暴所屈，不为失败所吓倒，失败了再干”。因此，他所写的《海瑞罢官》，是一株攻击党和社会主义的、借古非今的大毒草，必须连根铲除。
    但是，在报刊上对吴晗同志的错误进行公开的揭露和批判以后，吴晗同志撒谎说，我写《海瑞罢官》完全是“为写戏而写戏”，目的性“一点也没想起过”。这种狡辩只能是欲盖弥彰。我们不相信吴晗同志骗人的鬼话，希望他能够把内心深处不可告人的东西都拿出来，见见阳光。
