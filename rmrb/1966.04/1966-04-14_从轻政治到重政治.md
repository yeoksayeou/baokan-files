　　In the past, I thought that the most important thing for a doctor was professional skill. Therefore, I put my main effort into improving my professional skill level. When seeing patients with common illnesses, I was always relatively cursory; I was very interested in patients with rare and critical illnesses, researching literature, looking for materials, doing tests one moment, and examinations the next, regardless of whether it would increase the patient's suffering, always wanting to study some techniques. In October 1964, a child with hepatosplenomegaly and bloody stools for a year was admitted to the hospital. Before the diagnosis was clear, I thought it was a rare disease and gave him tests and fluoroscopies almost every day; later, I felt that since I couldn't figure it out, I simply gave up, often simply listening and touching, asking casually. The patient's parents were very dissatisfied with me, and the leaders also criticized me.
　　This incident greatly shocked me. I studied Chairman Mao's works with questions. Chairman Mao said in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "In the eyes of some people, it seems that there is no need to care about what politics, what the future of the motherland, and the ideals of mankind are. It seems that Marxism was popular for a while, but now it is not so popular." I thought, before I joined the Party, I paid more attention to ideological reform. After I joined the Party, I mistakenly thought that I was red enough, that the main issue was expertise, so I relaxed my political study, relaxed my self-transformation, and let bourgeois individualism raise its head, walking the path of downplaying politics. At this time, I woke up and then determined to thoroughly transform myself with Mao Zedong Thought, to serve the people completely and thoroughly.
　　Last November, when I was doing mobile medical service in Liuzhuang Commune, I found a poor peasant woman who was sallow and emaciated, with palpitations and shortness of breath, and a persistent low fever for a year. She had been treated many times without success. At the beginning, I had a sense of difficulty, feeling that the course of the disease was so long, and many doctors had not cured it. Now there is no X-ray fluoroscopy and no laboratory equipment, can it be done? At this moment, I thought of Comrade Bethune's spirit of extreme responsibility and extreme enthusiasm for the people, so I decided to overcome difficulties and save the life of this class sister. After repeated and careful examinations, we diagnosed the patient with severe hookworm anemia, and then treated her accordingly. In less than a month, the patient improved significantly and was able to do general productive labor. Later, she finally recovered basically.
　　This incident made me feel more deeply that a medical worker can better use his skills to serve the people only by using politics to command professional work.

### 从轻政治到重政治

    从轻政治到重政治
    过去我认为，对一个医生来说，最重要的是业务技术。所以，我把主要力量放在提高业务技术水平上。我为一般患常见病的病人看病时，总是比较粗糙；对患罕见病的病人和危重病人，兴趣却很大，查文献，找资料，一会儿作化验，一会儿作检查，不管会不会增加病人的痛苦，总想钻研出一些技术来。一九六四年十月，有一个肝脾肿大、伴有血便已一年的患儿入院，在诊断未明确之前，我以为这是罕见病，几乎天天要给他做化验透视等检查；后来觉得既然弄不清，也就干脆算了，常常简单地一听一摸，随便问问了事。病人的家长对我很不满意，领导也批评了我。
    这件事对我的震动很大。我带着问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一文中说：“在一些人的眼中，好象什么政治，什么祖国的前途，人类的理想，都没有关心的必要。好象马克思主义行时了一阵，现在就不那么行时了。”我想，自己在没有入党以前，还比较注意思想改造，入了党，就错误地认为红得差不多了，主要是专的问题，因而放松了政治学习，放松了自我改造，让资产阶级个人主义思想抬了头，走到轻政治的道路上去了。这时，我才醒悟过来，于是下定了决心，用毛泽东思想彻底改造自己，完全、彻底地为人民服务。
    去年十一月，我在刘庄公社巡回医疗，发现一位贫农妇女面黄肌瘦，心慌气短，持续低烧已有一年之久，多次诊治无效。开始的时候，我产生了畏难情绪，觉得病程这么长，经过了不少医生都没治好，现在一无X线透视，二无化验设备，能行吗？正在这个时候，我想起了白求恩同志那种对人民极端的负责和极端的热情的精神，于是决定克服困难，挽救这个阶级姊妹的生命。经过反复地细心地检查，我们确诊这位病人为重型钩虫性贫血，随即对症治疗。不到一个月的时间，病人就明显好转，能作一般生产劳动，后来终于基本痊愈。
    这件事使我更深切地感到：一个医务人员只有用政治统帅业务，才能更好地把自己的技术用来为人民服务。
