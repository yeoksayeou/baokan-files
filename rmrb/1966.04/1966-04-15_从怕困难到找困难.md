    Serving the people is the starting point for socialist commerce. Whether or not this is constantly kept in mind and consistently implemented in business activities is the primary key to whether a store can be run well.
    Why didn't the Huangpo Supply and Marketing Cooperative sell clay pot lids retail in the past? Some people put forward a long list of difficulties: procurement difficulties, storage difficulties, sales difficulties.... But no one thought about the difficulties of the broad masses in buying clay pot lids. Originally, they only planned for themselves, forgetting the starting point of serving the people.
    The incident of "losing" a clay pot lid sounded the alarm for them. After they established the idea of serving the people, various difficulties were readily solved. They even found some new "difficulties" for themselves—delivering clay pot lids to people's doorsteps, and adding other retail goods.
    The establishment of the Huangpo Supply and Marketing Cooperative's workers' ideology of serving the people is the result of struggling with the word "I". As they realized: "It is impossible to serve the people well with selfish and distracting thoughts." Only by overcoming the individual plans of disliking difficulties and fearing trouble can we serve the people completely and thoroughly, and only then can we move from fearing difficulties to actively seeking difficulties. How can we achieve this? This requires emphasizing politics, creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking.

    从怕困难到找困难
    为人民服务，是社会主义商业的出发点。是不是把这一条时时记在心上，时时贯彻到业务活动当中，这是一个商店能不能办好的首要关键。
    黄坡供销社过去为什么不零卖瓦煲盖？有人摆出了一大串困难：采购困难，保管困难，出售困难……。可就是没有想一想广大群众买不到瓦煲盖的困难。原来，他们只为自己打算，忘记了为人民服务这个出发点。
    “丢失”一个瓦煲盖的事件，给他们敲起了警钟。当他们树立起为人民服务的思想以后，各种困难都迎刃而解了。他们还给自己找了些新“困难”——挑瓦煲盖上门供应，增加了另外的零售商品。
    黄坡供销社职工为人民服务思想的树立，是同“我”字斗争的结果。正如他们所体会到的：“存在私心杂念，是不可能很好地为人民服务的。”只有克服了嫌困难、怕麻烦的个人打算，才能完全、彻底地为人民服务，才能从怕困难到主动地找困难。怎样才能做到这一点呢？这就要突出政治，活学活用毛主席著作，促进人的思想革命化。
