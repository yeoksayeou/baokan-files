    The Dominican People Sum Up Their Experiences in Revolutionary Practice and Advance Courageously
    Editor's Note: It has been one year since the Dominican people's patriotic armed uprising against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The Dominican people's patriotic armed uprising proves that the contradiction between the Latin American people and U.S. imperialism is irreconcilable, and the Latin American people's revolutionary struggle against U.S. imperialism cannot be stopped by anyone.
    Over the past year, the Dominican people's struggle against U.S. armed aggression has gone through a difficult and tortuous path. They have not only been subjected to interference, suppression, deception, and division by U.S. imperialism, but also to sabotage and betrayal by modern revisionists. However, although their patriotic armed uprising has not been successful, they have gained extremely important experience from the struggle. The remarks of some Dominican revolutionary organizations and revolutionaries published here show that through the struggle of the past year, the Dominican people have recognized the aggressive nature of U.S. imperialism and the accomplice role of modern revisionism, and have found the correct path of armed struggle, understanding the importance of establishing a united front based on the worker-peasant alliance to oppose U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.
    The path of development of the Dominican people's revolution, like that of the people of other countries, is also a process of practice, understanding, re-practice, and re-understanding. They have summed up experience and improved their understanding in the practice of revolution, which can better guide new revolutionary practice and lay a solid foundation for future victories. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out a year ago: "As long as we rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, and persist in protracted struggle, the Dominican anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, with the support of the people of the world, will surely achieve final victory." The Dominican people's revolutionary practice is proving this point.
     U.S. Imperialism is the Main Enemy of the Dominican People
    "Imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, is the main enemy of our people, the working class, and its political parties."
    ——Resolution of the First Preparatory Congress of the Dominican People's Movement
    "It is the Americans who massacre Dominicans, it is the Americans who exploit Dominican laborers, it is the Americans who trample on our national sovereignty, it is the Americans who steal our wealth and plunge the people into hunger and poverty..."
    "U.S. imperialism is the main source of all the suffering our motherland has suffered. Imperialism is trying to rely on its aggressive troops, through election conspiracies, colluding with politicians, to impose a colonial system on us."
        ——*Libertad*, organ of the Dominican People's Movement
    "In order for our people to live a progressive and happy life, we must drive the aggressive troops of the United States and its Latin American running dogs out of our country, who are wearing the cloak of 'Pan-American Peacekeeping Force'! We must eliminate the exploitation of our resources and our laboring people by American monopoly organizations."
            ——Statement of the Dominican June 14 Revolutionary Movement
    U.S. imperialism "talks about peace on the one hand, but arms itself to the teeth on the other, igniting flames of war all over the world to suppress the people's liberation movement."
    "While they talk about development plans in El Salvador, they kill hundreds of patriots in Vietnam, preventing the unification of the Vietnamese people. They tout the Alliance for Progress program while they invade the Dominican Republic. They deceptively build schools in Panama, while at the same time they use machine guns to strafe the unarmed people of this country who demand the return of the canal."
    The "nature" of U.S. imperialism "is: exploitation and the implementation of a policy of aggression and war against the people of all countries. Blackmail and threats are part of its general policy. Someone correctly said that imperialists chant Buddhist scriptures while sharpening their swords. The U.S. imperialists' crude policy of blackmail and threats has been fully exposed in our country."

### 美帝是多米尼加人民的主要敌人

    多米尼加人民在革命实践中总结经验勇往直前
    编者按：多米尼加人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的爱国武装起义已经一周年了。多米尼加人民的爱国武装起义证明，拉丁美洲人民同美帝国主义的矛盾是不可调和的，拉丁美洲人民反对美帝国主义的革命斗争是任何人都阻挡不了的。
    一年来，多米尼加人民反对美国武装侵略的斗争，经历了艰巨曲折的道路。他们不但遭到了美帝国主义的干涉镇压和欺骗分化，而且遭到了现代修正主义者的破坏和出卖。但是，尽管他们的爱国武装起义没有取得成功，他们却从斗争中得到了极其重要的经验。这里发表的多米尼加革命组织和革命者的一些言论表明，通过一年来的斗争，多米尼加人民认清了美帝国主义的侵略本性和现代修正主义的帮凶面目，而且找到了武装斗争的正确道路，懂得了建立以工农联盟为基础的统一战线来反对美帝国主义及其走狗的重要性。
    多米尼加人民革命的发展道路，同其他各国人民一样，也是一个实践、认识，再实践、再认识的过程。他们在革命的实践中总结了经验，提高了认识，就能更好地正确指导新的革命实践，为今后的胜利打下坚实的基础。毛泽东同志在一年前曾经指出：“只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，多米尼加的反美爱国斗争，在全世界人民的支持下，是一定能够取得最后胜利的”。多米尼加人民的革命实践，正在证明这一点。
     美帝是多米尼加人民的主要敌人
    “帝国主义特别是美帝国主义，是我国人民、工人阶级及其政党的主要敌人”	 ——多米尼加人民运动第一次预备代表大会决议
    “屠杀多米尼加人的是美国佬，剥削多米尼加劳动者的是美国佬，践踏我们国家主权的是美国佬，盗窃我们的财富并且使人民陷入饥饿和贫困的是美国佬。……”
    “美帝国主义是我们祖国所遭受的一切苦难的主要根源。帝国主义在企图依靠它的侵略军队，通过选举阴谋，勾结政客，把殖民制度强加给我们。”
        ——多米尼加人民运动机关报《自由报》
    “为使我国人民能过进步和幸福的生活，我们必须把披着‘泛美和平部队’外衣的美国及其拉丁美洲走狗的侵略军赶出我国！必须消灭美国垄断组织对我国资源和我国劳动人民的剥削。”
            ——多米尼加六月十四日革命运动声明
    美帝国主义“一方面谈论和平，一方面却武装到牙齿，在全世界到处燃起战火来镇压人民解放运动。”
    “他们在萨尔瓦多谈论发展计划的同时，在越南杀害成百的爱国者，阻止越南人民的统一。他们吹嘘争取进步联盟计划，同时他们侵略多米尼加共和国。他们在巴拿马迷惑人心地建造学校，而同时却用机枪扫射这个国家要求收回运河的手无寸铁的人民。”
    美帝国主义的“本性是：剥削和实行对各国人民的侵略和战争政策。讹诈和威胁是它的总政策的一部分。有人正确地说，帝国主义者一面念佛，一面磨剑。美帝国主义粗暴的讹诈和威胁政策在我国已经暴露无余。”
                            ——多米尼加《六月十四日报》
