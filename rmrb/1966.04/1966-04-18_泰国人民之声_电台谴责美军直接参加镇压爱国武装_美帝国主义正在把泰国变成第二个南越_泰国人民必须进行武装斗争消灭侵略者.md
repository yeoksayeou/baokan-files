    Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch from Bangkok: "Voice of the People of Thailand" radio station on the 11th called on the Thai people to wage armed struggle to completely crush the "special warfare" waged by U.S. imperialism and the Thanom [Kittikachorn] traitorous clique to suppress the people.

    The radio station said that since the end of last year, the United States and its lackey Thanom clique have successively conducted "encirclements and suppressions" against Nakhon Phanom Province, Sakon Nakhon Province, and Udon Thani Province in northeastern Thailand, but all were crushed by the armed forces of the people of the northeast.

    The radio station pointed out that these "encirclements and suppressions" were all commanded by the United States. Especially in the recent "encirclement and suppression" of the people of Lang Mu Nam Phu County in Udon Thani Province, the U.S. Air Force commando stationed at the Udon Thani base directly participated in the action.

    The radio station said that the fact that the U.S. military directly participated in suppressing the Thai people made it clear to the Thai people and the people of the world that the United States is an aggressor occupying Thailand, a butcher who slaughters the Thai people, and at the same time completely exposed the ugly face of the traitorous Thanom clique.

    The radio station pointed out that the U.S. military daring to directly participate in suppressing the Thai people is a serious step. The U.S. military will not be limited to suppressing the people in the northeast, but will inevitably expand to all the land of Thailand, thus becoming like the situation in South Vietnam.

    The radio station said that the United States' direct participation in suppressing the Thai people shows that the patriotic forces in Thailand have grown stronger, forcing the United States to personally carry out suppression. However, the result will be contrary to the wishes of the United States, and will only further arouse the resentment of the Thai people, making them more clearly see that the United States and the Thanom clique are the real enemies of the Thai nation and people, thereby strengthening their determination to fight to the end.

    The radio station emphasized that the enemy is preparing to massively massacre the Thai people, so the Thai people must also make full preparations and resolutely fight. The radio station called on the Thai people to unite widely and closely, and to carry out various forms of struggle, especially armed struggle, to crush the enemy's armed suppression, until finally, completely, and cleanly eliminating the American aggressors from the land of Thailand.

    “泰国人民之声”电台谴责美军直接参加镇压爱国武装
    美帝国主义正在把泰国变成第二个南越
    泰国人民必须进行武装斗争消灭侵略者
    新华社十七日讯　曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台十一日号召泰国人民进行武装斗争，彻底粉碎美帝国主义和他侬卖国集团进行的镇压人民的“特种战争”。
    电台说，自从去年年底以来，美国和它的走狗他侬集团先后对泰国东北部那空拍侬府、沙功那空府和乌隆府进行了“围剿”，结果都被东北部人民武装力量所粉碎。
    电台指出，这几次“围剿”都是美国指挥的，尤其是在最近对乌隆府廊磨南普县人民的“围剿”中，驻在乌隆府基地的美国空军突击队就直接参加了行动。
    电台说，美军直接参加镇压泰国人民这一事实，使泰国人民和全世界人民清楚地看到，美国是占领泰国的侵略者，是屠杀泰国人民的刽子手，同时也彻底暴露了他侬卖国集团的丑恶面目。
    电台指出，美军敢于直接参加镇压泰国人民，这是一个严重的步骤。美军将不会只限于镇压东北部的人民，而且必将扩大到泰国所有的土地上，从而变成象南越的情形一样。
    电台说，美国直接参加镇压泰国人民表明，泰国爱国力量已经发展壮大，使美国不得不亲自动手进行镇压。但是，其结果将同美国的愿望相反，只会更加激起泰国人民的愤恨，使他们更清楚地看到美国和他侬集团是泰国民族和人民的真正敌人，从而使他们更坚定了斗争到底的决心。
    电台强调说，敌人正在准备大规模屠杀泰国人民，因此泰国人民也必须作好充分的准备，坚决进行斗争。电台号召泰国人民要广泛地紧密地团结起来，进行各种形式的斗争，特别是武装斗争，用以粉碎敌人的武装镇压，直至最后完全、彻底、干净地把美国侵略者消灭在泰国的土地上。
