    On the production accounting board of the sewing workshop, the arrows on the product quality chart rose daily. The shoe upper receiver followed the inspector closely, urging, "Master Zhang, the quality of these products is guaranteed, just put the qualified stamp on them."

    Master Zhang is an old worker named Zhang Qinsheng. Wearing his reading glasses and holding a template and calipers, he always inspected each stack of cut shoe uppers at a slow and steady pace. Sometimes, when they urged him too much, he would say with a smile, "Don't rush, don't rush, rushing easily leads to mistakes."

    "We're not rushing, you see the molding workshop is increasing production every day, constantly urging us to deliver the goods."

    "Deliver the goods when it's time to deliver, but the idea of quality first cannot be forgotten—" Before he finished speaking, a stack of shoe uppers deeply attracted his attention. The receiver took a closer look, and Master Zhang had already placed the shoe uppers that had been measured with a template and calipers aside. The pleasant smile on his face vanished instantly, and he kept muttering, "These young lads still haven't firmly established the idea of quality first."

    "Oh! There are unqualified ones!" The receiver asked in a panic.

    "Short by 0.5 millimeters."

    Hearing that it was only short by 0.5 millimeters, the receiver breathed a sigh of relief and said nonchalantly, "Oh, I thought it was a lot more, it's only short by 0.5 millimeters, just a few strands of hair. What's the big deal, just stretch the shoe upper cloth a little."

    "According to you, you've wasted your time studying Chairman Mao's works. There's not a single thought of 'good' first, quality first, in your head." These few words left the receiver speechless, and he left.

    Master Zhang is a hot-tempered person. When the product quality is good, he always has a smile on his face when people talk to him, his eyes squinting into a line. When the product quality is poor, his face tightens, and his thick eyebrows stand straight up. Because of his fiery personality, he used to argue with people frequently about the problem of inspecting shoe uppers. Some people once advised him, "Old Zhang, you're so old, if it's not too far off, just let it go, why offend people!" Hearing these words, his face tightened even more, his eyebrows stood up straighter, and he said indignantly, "Now we are engaged in socialist construction, and we workers are in charge ourselves. Since the working class is in charge, we must have an attitude of ownership. If we're afraid of offending people, how can we guarantee good product quality?" Over the years, he has been stubbornly adhering to the quality control with this selfless and unyielding temperament. Someone gave him a nickname, calling him "Old Gatekeeper." He didn't get happy or object, but said meaningfully, "The one who truly keeps a good check on quality is not me, this selfless inspector, but Mao Zedong Thought."

    Master Zhang studies Chairman Mao's works particularly seriously. He carries Chairman Mao's works with him every day, and he seizes every bit of spare time to study. This day, when he picked up the unqualified shoe uppers and wanted to immediately criticize the cutting workers, Chairman Mao's words suddenly flashed in his mind: "All people in the revolutionary ranks must care for each other, love each other, and help each other." Instantly, the tense muscles on his face relaxed, and he changed his mind: What's the use of just criticizing people with a stern face? I should help them improve their thinking.

    After the break bell rang in the workshop, a group of young people from the cutting team jumped and ran to Master Zhang's workbench, vying to see the qualification rate of their products. One of them, a burly young man, picked up the stack of unqualified shoe uppers that Master Zhang had just inspected and asked in surprise, "These shoe uppers are still unqualified?"

    "Don't believe it? Measure it yourself!" Another worker said.

    The young man snatched the shoe uppers, picked up a template and calipers, and measured them. "Short by 0.5 millimeters. Hey! Is being short by 0.5 millimeters still considered unqualified?"

    "Of course, being short means it's unqualified." Another worker chimed in.

    "I say, this is a bit too strict. How can there not be a single grain of rice in a bowl of rice!"

    "That's old thinking. Now we are engaged in socialist construction, we must put 'good' first, 'strict' leading. Being off by a little bit means it can't be considered a qualified product."

    Everyone talked at once, arguing endlessly about this stack of shoe uppers. Master Zhang sat aside, taking off his glasses with both hands and putting them back on his nose from time to time, silently listening to everyone's arguments. Finally, he stared at the burly young man who was in a daze on the side with a smiling tone, saying, "You cut the uppers, what's your own opinion?"

    "To be honest, this stack of uppers was originally cut a bit off; but I felt that the difference was only a few threads, it didn't matter much; besides, you don't know, my output has always been behind others these days, so I..."

    Before the young man could finish speaking, another young man said, "Master Zhang, the difference is not much, I think we should just let it go, besides, his quality has improved a lot compared to before."

    The workshop was very quiet, and people were waiting for Master Zhang's opinion. Master Zhang didn't say anything, he casually took out a copy of "Selected Readings from the Works of Mao Zedong" and gave it to the young man, and pointed to an article on one of the pages marked with red lines and said, "Let's study this article once first." When the young man read "Comrade Bethune's spirit of utter devotion to others without any thought of self is manifested in his boundless sense of responsibility in his work" "…perfection in his skill", Master Zhang said, "Comrade Bethune is extremely responsible in his work and seeks perfection in his skill, what attitude should we have towards product quality?"

    Everyone said in unison, "We should learn from Bethune, develop solid skills, and eliminate rework."

    "Yes, everyone is right. Then these shoe uppers are not much different, is it okay not to rework them?" Master Zhang picked up the stack of unqualified shoe uppers, pretending to stamp them with a qualified stamp. The young man got anxious and snatched the shoe uppers from Master Zhang's hand, saying, "That won't do, I'll rework them." Saying that, he happily strode towards the fighting production post.

    “老把关”
    湖南橡胶厂　李仲秋
    缝帮车间生产核算牌上，产品质量图表上的箭头天天上升。鞋帮收发员不时跟在检验员身后，催促说：“张师傅，这些产品的质量，保险都要得，只管打合格印就是。”
    张师傅是个老工人，叫张勤生。他戴着老花眼镜，手里拿着样板、卡尺，总是那么不急不慢地检验每一迭裁好的鞋帮。有时候催得急了，就笑呵呵地说：“莫忙，莫忙，忙中易出错。”
    “不忙，你看人家成型车间天天增产，老催着我们交货。”
    “交货就交货呗，质量第一的思想还是不能忘——”他的话声未落，一迭鞋帮深深地吸引住了他的注意力。收发员凑近一看，张师傅已经把用样板、卡尺量比过的鞋帮放在一旁，脸上愉快的笑容顿时消失了，嘴里不住地唠叨：“这些青年伢子，质量第一的思想还是没有树得牢。”
    “哟！有不合格的啦！”收发员惊慌地问。
    “短零点五公厘。”
    听到只短零点五公厘，收发员松了口气，淡淡地说：“啊哟，我还以为差得多呢，原来只差零点五公厘，不过几根头发丝。有什么了不起呢，把鞋帮布拉紧一点就行了。”
    “照你这么说，毛主席著作你白学了。脑子里没一点好字当头、质量第一的思想。”几句话把收发员说得不好开口，就走了。
    张师傅是个性情火辣的人，遇上产品质量好的时候，别人跟他说话，脸上总是挂着笑，眼睛眯成一条缝；遇上产品质量差，脸就绷紧，一对浓眉也竖得笔直。由于他这种火辣性格，以前在检验鞋帮问题上，常跟人家顶吵。曾经有个别人劝他：“老张，你年纪这么大了，只要差得不多，放过就算了，何必得罪人呢！”听了这些话，他脸绷得更紧，眉毛竖得更直，带气地说：“如今是搞社会主义建设，是我们工人阶级自己当家。工人阶级当家，就得有个主人翁的态度。怕得罪人，怎么能保证产品质量好？”几年来，他就是凭着这铁面无私的犟脾气，死卡着质量关。有人给他送个外号，叫“老把关”。他自己听了，一不高兴，二不反对，却意味深长地说：“真正把好质量关的，不是我这个铁面无私的检验员，而是毛泽东思想。”
    张师傅学习毛主席著作特别认真，每天毛主席著作随身带，有一点空就抓紧学习。这天，当他拿起不合格的鞋帮，想立刻就去批评裁帮工人几句时，毛主席的话忽然闪现在心间：“一切革命队伍的人都要互相关心，互相爱护，互相帮助。”顿时，他脸上绷紧的肌肉松弛了，心里拐了个弯：光绷着脸批评人又有什么用呢？应该帮助他提高思想。
    车间里中休的电铃拉响后，裁帮组的一群青年蹦蹦跳跳地围到张师傅工作台前，争着看自己产品的合格率，其中一个虎势雄雄的青年，拿起刚被张师傅验出的那迭不合格鞋帮，惊奇地问：“这样的鞋帮还不合格？”
    “不相信，自己量嘛！”另一个工人说。
    那个青年顺手夺过鞋帮，拿起样板、卡尺就量。“短零点五公厘。嘿！短零点五公厘还算不合格？”
    “那当然罗，短了就是不合格。”又有一个工人插嘴。
    “我说，这也太严了一点。一碗饭里哪有没有一粒谷的呢！”
    “这是旧思想，现在我们搞社会主义建设，要好字当头，严字领先，差一点，就不能算合格品。”
    大家七嘴八舌，为着这迭鞋帮争论不休。张师傅坐在一旁，一会把眼镜用双手摘下，一会又架上鼻梁，默默地听着大家争论。末了，他以含笑的口吻，盯着那位在一旁发呆的虎势雄雄的青年说：“帮子是你裁的，你自己的看法呢？”
    “说实在话，这迭帮子，本来是裁偏了一点；不过我觉得相差只几根纱，关系不大；再说，你不晓得，我这几天来，产量总是落在人家后面，所以我……”
    这位青年的话还没说完，有个青年就说：“张师傅，相差不多，我看就算了，再说，他的质量比以前提高多了。”
    车间里很寂静，人们都在等待张师傅的意见。张师傅没有说什么，随手拿出一本《毛泽东著作选读本》送给那个青年，并指着其中一页划满红杠的文章说：“我们先把这篇文章学一遍看。”当那位青年读到“白求恩同志毫不利己专门利人的精神，表现在他对工作的极端的负责任”“……对技术精益求精”时，张师傅说：“白求恩同志对工作极端负责任，对技术精益求精，我们对待产品质量应该抱什么态度呢？”
    大家异口同声地说：“应该学习白求恩，练出硬本领来，消灭返工品。”
    “对，大家说得对。那这迭鞋帮相差不多，是不是不返工算了？”张师傅拿起那迭不合格的鞋帮，装着要打合格印的样子。那青年小伙子急了，一把从张师傅手里夺过鞋帮，说：“那不行，我去返工。”说着，愉快地踏着稳实的步子，向战斗的生产岗位上走去。（附图片）
