In a county, there are many tasks and heavy production assignments. Should the county Party committee focus on politics to promote production, or just focus on production? Should it focus on class struggle and the struggle between two lines, or just push for planting and harvesting? This is a fundamental issue of ideological understanding.

In the past, we lacked a correct understanding of the relationship between politics and production. Although we often emphasized the importance of politics in words, in our minds, we thought that production was tangible, while politics was intangible. Therefore, in our work, we focused more on production measures and less on political work; in our leadership methods, we had more general political calls and less in-depth ideological work; in the relationship between people and things, we paid more attention to natural conditions and less to people's subjective initiative; in learning from other places, we learned more specific techniques and less revolutionary spirit; in organizing cadres to study, we focused more on specific business and less on studying Chairman Mao's works. The result was: we worked hard all day, but the achievements were not great.

Through the practice of class struggle in the countryside and the socialist education movement, we have gained a clearer understanding of the relationship between politics and production, and between class struggle and production struggle. We have come to realize that production struggle is inseparable from class struggle at all times. Because in a class society, people are always class people, always with certain purposes, certain ideological viewpoints, and certain labor attitudes and mental states, engaging in production activities. Therefore, only by focusing on class struggle and the struggle between two lines in production struggle can we adhere to the socialist direction and promote the healthy development of production. This point was deeply impressed upon us through last year's disaster relief efforts.

Last year, our county suffered from drought, hail, wind, and pests, causing significant losses to crops such as wheat and cotton. What should we do? Some people with serious capitalist thoughts advocated for "developing sideline businesses, seizing opportunities, and each finding their own way to cope with the disaster"; class enemies also took the opportunity to emerge, saying things like "studying Dazhai all day, and now we've brought on a big disaster." At this critical moment, we focused on political work and the struggle between two lines, mobilizing all positive factors in the disaster relief struggle. County and commune-level cadres went deep into the affected communes, organizing cadres and the masses to study Chairman Mao's thoughts on strategically despising the enemy and tactically taking the enemy seriously, and the revolutionary spirit of Dazhai in the face of disasters. We also organized discussions on whether to rely on the power of collective economy to overcome disasters or let capitalist spontaneous forces run wild. Through study and discussion, everyone's minds became clear. They said: "Collective economy is our lifeline, disaster relief relies on collective economy." "Without disasters, we walk the path of Dazhai, and with disasters, we still walk the path of Dazhai." The masses firmly walked the socialist path, opposed capitalist tendencies, and formed an iron stream of self-reliance and arduous struggle to overcome disasters. Six months later, the county's grain and cotton all achieved a bumper harvest. This is a victory of emphasizing politics, a victory of Mao Zedong Thought.

Recently, we held a meeting of cadres at all four levels in the county, summarizing the experiences of ideological and political work in the past year's disaster relief struggle, and focusing on solving the core issue of "five breaks and five establishments" with emphasizing politics. (1) Break the passive and relaxed, retreat and replacement mindset, and establish the thorough revolutionary spirit of continuous revolution and progress; (2) Break the mindset of having no great aspirations and being satisfied with the status quo, and establish the great aspirations of fighting against heaven and earth and changing heaven and earth; (3) Break the mindset of relying on heaven, earth, and state support, and establish the revolutionary spirit of relying on the Party, the masses, and self-reliance; (4) Break the metaphysical viewpoint, and establish the dialectical thought of one divides into two; (5) Break the mindset of harmony without principles, and establish the atmosphere of criticism and self-criticism. After the meeting, the revolutionary spirit of the cadres was greatly boosted, and they all went deep into reality, went to the countryside for in-depth work, and led the masses in the struggle to change heaven and earth.

    我们从抗灾中受到一次突出政治的教育
    抓阶级斗争才不会迷失方向
    在一个县里，工作头绪多，生产任务重，党的县委会究竟是抓政治促生产，还是就生产抓生产？是抓阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争，还是只抓催种催收？这是思想认识上的根本问题。
    过去，我们对政治和生产的关系，缺乏正确的认识。虽然在口头上经常强调抓政治，但是在思想认识上总以为生产是看得见、摸得着的，政治是看不见、摸不着的。因此，在具体工作上，抓生产措施多，抓政治工作少；在领导方法上，一般的政治号召多，深入细致的思想工作少；在人与物的关系上，对自然条件看得多，对人的主观能动性看得少；在学习外地经验上，具体技术学得多，革命精神学得少；在组织干部学习上，学习具体业务多，学习毛主席著作少。结果是：成天辛辛苦苦，成绩不大。
    经过农村阶级斗争的实践，经过社会主义教育运动，我们对政治与生产、阶级斗争与生产斗争的关系，才有了比较明确的认识。我们认识到：生产斗争时时刻刻都脱离不了阶级斗争。因为在有阶级的社会中，人总是阶级的人，总是带着一定的目的、一定的思想观点，以一定的劳动态度与精神状态，去从事生产活动的。所以，只有在生产斗争中抓阶级斗争，抓两条道路的斗争，才能坚持社会主义的方向，推动生产健康的发展。对于这一点，通过去年的抗灾斗争，我们又一次受到了深刻的教育。
    去年，我县遭到了旱、雹、风、虫等灾害，小麦和棉花等作物损失很大。怎么办呢？一些资本主义思想比较严重的人主张“搞副业，抓现成，各显神通度灾荒”；阶级敌人也趁机出笼，说什么“整天学大寨，这可把大灾学来了”。在这关键时刻，我们狠抓政治工作，狠抓两条道路的斗争，调动一切抗灾斗争的积极因素。县社两级干部深入受灾社队，组织干部和群众大学毛主席关于战略上藐视敌人、战术上重视敌人的思想，大学大寨人受灾后旗不倒、志不屈的革命精神，并组织大家讨论是靠集体经济的威力来战胜灾害呢，还是让资本主义自发势力泛滥呢？通过学习和讨论，大家的心里亮了。他们说：“集体经济是咱的命根子，抗灾要靠集体经济。”“没灾，咱走大寨的路，遭了灾，还是走大寨的路。”广大群众坚定地走社会主义道路，反对一些人的资本主义倾向，汇成了一股依靠集体抗灾斗争的铁流，自力更生，艰苦奋斗，抗住了各种灾害。六个月后，全县粮棉都获得了丰收。这是突出政治的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    最近，我们召开了全县四级干部会议，总结了一年来抗灾斗争中的思想政治工作经验，大抓各级干部思想革命化，集中地解决了以突出政治为核心的“五破五立”问题。（1）大破消极松劲，退坡换班的思想，大立不断革命、不断前进的彻底革命精神；（2）大破胸无大志、满足现状的“守摊摊”思想，大立战天斗地、改天换地的雄心壮志；（3）大破靠天靠地靠国家支援的思想，大立靠党靠群众靠自力更生的革命精神；（4）大破形而上学观点，大立一分为二的辩证思想；（5）大破一团和气不讲原则的思想，大树批评与自我批评的风气。会后，广大干部的革命精神大振，纷纷深入实际，下乡蹲点，领导群众进行改天换地的斗争。
