    Cultural Exchange Between China and Myanmar
    Yin Da

    China and Myanmar are close neighbors, sharing over two thousand kilometers of continuous border. Although separated by towering mountains and rushing rivers, the mountains are connected, and the rivers are connected. For over two thousand years, through generations of friendly exchanges between the peoples of both countries, land and water routes have long been opened. Along these routes, economic and cultural exchanges between the two countries have been conducted for a long time.

    I

    In China's "Records of the Grand Historian,"① there is a record of the following:

    Around 138 BC (the third year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's Jianyuan reign), when Zhang Qian was on a mission to the Western Regions, he saw Chinese Qiong bamboo staffs and Sichuan cloth in Daxia (Bactria). He asked where these items came from. The people of Daxia said they came from Shendu (India), thousands of miles southeast, bought from Sichuan merchants. He also heard that two thousand miles west of Qiong was Shendu. In 126 BC (the third year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's Yuanshuo reign), after Zhang Qian returned to China, he said that Daxia was southwest of China and wanted to trade with China, but the Xiongnu blocked the eastern roads. He believed that if the southwestern border route could be opened, it would be a shortcut to Shendu (India). Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty sent people to open this route, but they were stopped by the Dian king (in Yunnan) and could not reach Shendu.

    Although the Han Dynasty envoys were unable to reach India from southwestern China, it shows that over two thousand years ago, a route already existed for the southwestern people to reach Myanmar from Sichuan and Yunnan, and then through Myanmar to India and various countries in the South China Sea.

    China's "Book of Han" also records sea routes to Myanmar②, and through Myanmar to various countries in the South China Sea:

    "From the barriers of Rinan, Xuwen, and Hepu, ships can travel for five months to the country of Duyuan; then for four months to the country of Yilumo; then for twenty-odd days to the country of Chenli; and by foot for ten-odd days to the country of Fugandulu. From the country of Fugandulu, ships can travel for two months and more to the country of Huangzhi, whose customs are roughly similar to those of Zhuya... From Huangzhi, ships can travel for eight months to Pizong; and for eight months to the border of Rinan and Xianglin." South of Huangzhi is the country of Yichengbu, from where the Han Dynasty's interpreters returned. The countries of Yilumo, Chenli, and Fugandulu were mostly located within present-day Myanmar③. This shows that in the 1st century BC, some ancient states had already been established in Myanmar, and they had interactions with China. Yu Huan in "A Brief History of the Wei"④ once said:

    "The route to Daqin (Roman Empire) is connected both by land north of the sea and by sea to the south, with foreign tribes outside the seven commanderies of Jiaozhi. To the north, there is also a waterway connecting Yizhou and Yongchang, so Yongchang produces exotic goods. Previous generations only discussed the waterway, not knowing about the land route, which is roughly as follows." "A waterway connects Yizhou and Yongchang," which means that at that time, one could go from Yongchang in China through the Taiping River or the Ruili River, down the Irrawaddy River, to Myanmar.

    Here, I do not intend to make a detailed geographical study, but simply want to use these records to illustrate that during the Han and Three Kingdoms periods, both by land and by sea, China and Myanmar already had channels for friendly exchanges.

    From then on, the interactions between China and Myanmar, adapting to the social and historical developments of both countries, sometimes went by land, sometimes by sea, sometimes more by land, sometimes by sea, but the exchanges between them never ceased.

    By the Tang Dynasty, the exchanges between China and Myanmar became increasingly frequent, and sea and land transportation were well-established. Records of transportation routes became more detailed. Jia Dan's record is a strong argument⑤:

    "From Yangjuyang City (Dali) west to the old Yongchang Commandery is 300 li; then west across the Nu River (Salween) to Zhuge Liang City is 200 li; then south to Le City is 200 li; then entering the territory of the Pyu Kingdom, passing through the eight tribes including Wan Gong, to the city of Xili is 700 li; then passing through Tumin City to the Pyu Kingdom (Pro me) is 1000 li; then from the Pyu Kingdom west across the Black Mountains, to the Kamarupa country of Eastern India is 1600 li; then northwest across the Karatoya River to the Pundavarhana country is 600 li; then southwest to the Kajangala country on the southern bank of the Ganges (Gangos) in the eastern border of Central India is 400 li; then west to the Magdha country is 600 li. Another route goes from Zhuge Liang City west to Tengchong City is 200 li; then west to Mi City is 100 li; then west across a mountain is 200 li to Lishui City; then west across the Lishui (Irrawaddy) and Longquan Rivers is 200 li to Xi'an City; then west across the Minuo River (Chindwin) is 1000 li to the Brahmin country of Daqin; then west across the Great Ridge is 300 li to the Kamapupa country in the northern border of Eastern India, then southwest 1200 li to the Pundavarhana country in the northeastern border of Central India, where it merges with the Pyu Kingdom's route to the Brahmins."

    Although the above is a record of the Tang Dynasty routes, in reality, it must be a record of routes that existed before the Tang Dynasty. Before and after the Tang Dynasty, the people in the border areas customarily traveled along the rivers and mountain roads in the mountains, and there were definitely more interconnected roads than these. This is just an incomplete record. Through this record, we can see that Dali and Yongchang in China had become important cities leading to Myanmar, and that there were frequent exchanges with Myanmar, the Irrawaddy River area, and other countries. At that time, the port of the Irrawaddy River was not only an important place for Myanmar to communicate with other countries, but also provided great convenience for China to communicate with overseas countries.

    We can say that since the Tang Dynasty, China and Myanmar's sea and land transportation had been largely formed. Since then, through the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, the exchanges between the two countries became increasingly close, and the sea and land transportation routes gradually became more complete.

    Since ancient times, these sea and land transportation routes have made the economic and cultural friendly exchanges between the peoples of the two countries closer day by day.

    II

    Since ancient times, the peoples of China and Myanmar have exchanged goods and materials, opening up communication routes through great hardship. The opening of roads has promoted economic and cultural exchanges. These roads, after long-term exchanges, gradually formed one of the smooth routes for trade between China and Southeast Asian countries.

    During the Wei and Jin dynasties in China, Yongchang in Yunnan became a necessary passage to the Irrawaddy River in Myanmar. A large number of goods were transported through here to Southeast Asian countries, and at the same time, goods from Myanmar and Southeast Asian countries were sent to the interior. Therefore, people at that time said, "Yongchang produces exotic goods."

    The Pyu Kingdom was one of the countries in Myanmar at that time. Its capital, Sri Ksetra (present-day Pyay or Prome), became an important distribution center for trade. Along the Irrawaddy River, upstream, the ancient Burmese capital of Tagaung became a rest stop for merchants, and the coastal city of Thaton became a commercial city for trade between Myanmar and China, India, and Southeast Asian countries.⑥

    Cotton produced in Myanmar was introduced into China a long time ago. Myanmar produces gemstones, the most famous of which are amber and sapphire, which were imported into China very early.

    Cotton is a necessity for people's lives. In the Jin Dynasty, it was known that Pyu produced cotton. Guo Gongyi said, "There is a white Wutong tree. The Pyu country has white Tung wood, and its flowers are white. Take its fluff, soak and weave it into cloth."⑦

    Tung wood is cotton. This shows that cotton has a long history in Myanmar and has long been transmitted from Yongchang to the interior of China. The poet Zuo Si also praised the cloth woven from this cotton as "cloth with kapok flowers."

    Myanmar cotton has always been one of the main commodities imported into southwestern China. In 1826, 14 million pounds were imported, worth 228,000 pounds sterling⑧. Since then, imperialism has invaded our two countries, and this situation has changed.

    The emperors of the Han Dynasty sent people with "gold and miscellaneous silks" via sea to Southeast Asian countries in exchange for "pearls, jade, colored glaze, strange stones, and exotic objects"⑨. When they arrived in the countries of Yilumo and Fugandulu in what is now Myanmar, they already knew that gemstones were produced there.

    During the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the jade and jewelry trade between China and Myanmar was extremely prosperous, and Tengchong in Yunnan became a processing site for jade from northern Myanmar. With the permission of Myanmar, many Chinese went to Myanmar to mine jade, transported it to Tengchong, made it into ornaments, and sold it in China. At that time, there were more than a hundred Yunnan jade and jewelry merchants in Myanmar. A temple in the ancient city of Amarapura in Myanmar still preserves a stone inscription bearing the names of five thousand Chinese jade merchants from the Qing Dynasty. In the past, Myanmar lacked copper and iron. Burmese merchants exchanged jade jewelry for copper and iron. Every year, thousands of Chinese transported a large number of scissors, sewing needles, copper gongs, iron pots, and other utensils to Myanmar⑩. This friendly exchange of goods and materials enriched the lives of the people of both countries and strengthened the friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    Elephants are a special product of Myanmar. White elephants are considered the noblest animals in Myanmar. When envoys from the two countries interacted with each other, Myanmar often used such precious specialties as gifts to China, which embodies the deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    Because our two countries have a long border, where mountains are connected to mountains, water to water, and villages are adjacent, the border people of the two countries often have the same blood, language, customs, and habits. They have long been friends and relatives visiting each other. It is through the promotion of the people of the two countries at the border that we have carried out long-term and frequent economic exchanges, which inevitably promotes cultural exchanges between the two countries.

    III

    Myanmar and China have a long history of cultural and artistic exchange.

    In 97 AD (the ninth year of Emperor He of the Han Dynasty's Yongyuan reign), the Shan state—one of the states within Myanmar at that time—sent envoys to the capital of the Han Dynasty. In 120 AD (the first year of Emperor An of the Han Dynasty's Yongning reign), the Shan state again sent envoys, accompanied by an orchestra and performers of illusions. These illusion performers could "breathe fire, dismember themselves and exchange ox and horse heads, and were good at juggling balls, with numbers reaching up to a thousand?" Myanmar has been a country that loves music since ancient times, and the arrival of musicians would certainly have had some influence on ancient Chinese music. In these records, it is also recorded that these illusion performers said, "I am from the western sea; the western sea is Daqin." Therefore, some people also suspect that these illusionists may not have been from the Shan state, but accompanied the Shan envoys. However, even if they were illusionists from Daqin, the fact that the Shan state chose them to perform in the Han Dynasty proves that this kind of illusion had already had a considerable influence in the Shan state. I think this illusion—a skill loved by the people—may have become a folk art in the Shan state at that time.

    Speaking of this, I am reminded of the "Dulu Acrobatic Pole Climbing" that was popular in the Han Dynasty. Zhang Heng mentioned "Dulu Acrobatic Pole Climbing," and said, "The skills at the end of the pole are infinitely varied"?, and said, "If it were not for the agility of Dulu, who could surpass and ascend to the end." "Pole Climbing" is a skill of climbing poles. Why is this acrobatics called "Dulu Acrobatic Pole Climbing"? Dulu is the name of a country, because the people of the Dulu country were "strong, agile, and good at climbing high," so it was called "Dulu Acrobatic Pole Climbing." Dulu country is Fugandulu country?. It was one of the countries in what is now Myanmar. The fact that this pole climbing skill was linked to one of the countries in Myanmar shows that this skill existed in the Dulu country at that time. Fu Xuan once vividly described this skill:

    "There are skilled children, with wonderful skills, Dulu swift feet, climbing up and down the tall pole, their forms changing and their shadows connected; suddenly they turn upside down from the branch, as if about to fall and then continue, coiling like dragons, flowing and winding; the top of the pole is the head, and the belly is the journey, bearing the strictness of the numerous joints."?

    As for the juggling of balls, it is also often seen in the writings of literati. Li You said, "Facing high, treading on ropes, jumping and spinning, flying balls and jumping swords, bubbling and churning."?

    This kind of "Dulu Acrobatic Pole Climbing" and "juggling balls and jumping swords" was quite common in the Han Dynasty. Even now, various images of these skills are often found on stone carvings and painted bricks left over from the Han Dynasty?.

    Here, we do not need to explore the question of "which country did this 'swallowing knives and breathing fire,' 'Dulu Acrobatic Pole Climbing,' and 'flying balls and jumping swords' originate from, and which country did it spread to," nor do we want to explore "who influenced whom." What we value is that before the Common Era, the two countries were exchanging these folk skills, so in addition to these skills, there must have been other aspects of cultural exchange.

    Around the 5th century, the Pyu Kingdom in Myanmar was quite prosperous. It was about 2,000 li away from Yongchang in China. It "borders Lục Chân Lạp to the east, East India to the west, Dvaravati to the southwest, the sea to the south, and Nanzhao to the north. Its land is 3,000 li long and 5,000 li wide." "It communicates with 20 countries including Rogavatti to the east."? Later, the Pyu Kingdom's interactions with the Tang Dynasty also increased.

    In 801 AD (the 17th year of Emperor Dezong of the Tang Dynasty's Zhenyuan reign), the Pyu Kingdom's envoy, Shunan Tuo, came to the capital of the Tang Dynasty, Chang'an. This time, he brought a large musical and dance troupe of 35 people. This included their national music of twelve pieces: "Buddha's Seal," "Zan Poluo," "White Dove," "White Crane Travels," "Fighting Sheep Victory," "Dragon Head Single Qin," "Zen Meditation," "Sugar Cane King," "Peacock King," "Wild Goose," "Banquet Music," and "Washing Away烦恼 (worries)": carrying twenty-two different musical instruments: four cymbals, two iron plates for tapping to keep time, four conch horns, two phoenix-headed gourds, two crocodile-headed zithers, one dragon lute, one cloud-headed lute, two large gourd zithers, one single-string gourd zither, two small gourd zithers, two transverse flutes, two large gourd sheng, two small gourd sheng, two three-sided drums, four small drums, a spear sheng, a triangular sheng, and a two-cornered sheng, etc. After the musical and dance troupe performed in Chang'an, it caused a sensation. Many famous writers left poems for this. Yuan Zhen and Bai Juyi both wrote "Pyu Kingdom Music." Bai Juyi used such verses to describe the Pyu Kingdom's songs and dances:

    "Jade conch blown, topknot soars, bronze drum struck, tattooed body leaps; pearl tassels dazzling, stars swaying, flower garlands competing, dragons and snakes moving."? Hu Zhijun watched the performance of this song and dance in the Imperial Ancestral Temple and said:

    "Talent can distinguish the scales, surprisingly new rhythms, turning the embroidered face, bending and folding the tattooed body."?

    The "Biography of the Pyu Kingdom" in the "New Book of Tang" describes this performance in considerable detail, with detailed records of the coordination of music, the form of the dance, the types of musical instruments, etc. It also recorded their posture of singing and dancing:

    "Each time a piece is performed, they all sing in unison, each with both hands and ten fingers, opening and closing in unison, as a state of keeping time, one low and one high, never failing to face each other, similar to the Chinese Zhe Zhi dance."?

    Wei Gao, the military governor of Xichuan, once saw in Chengdu that the "dance appearance" and musical instruments of the Pyu Kingdom song and dance troupe were very novel, and he also painted a "Pyu Music Picture" and sent it to Chang'an. Such performances of songs and dances would certainly have had a considerable impact on Chinese music and dance.

    It is said in historical records that these "musical pieces all interpret the words and meanings of Buddhist scriptures."?

    The Pyu Kingdom and India were close neighbors, so its music and dance were influenced by Buddhism. Buddhism was introduced into China in the Han Dynasty. From the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, Indian and Central Asian Buddhists came to China by sea or land to preach, and Chinese Buddhists often went to the Western Regions by land or sea. Buddhism was at its peak from the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and it had a considerable impact on Chinese culture thereafter.

    At that time, Yongchang had become one of China's main land routes to Southeast Asia and Southwest countries via Myanmar. Indian and Chinese Buddhist believers could very well have used this route to introduce Buddhist scriptures. The monk Hui Rui of the Eastern Jin Dynasty "traveled and studied," "traveling through the western border of Shu (Sichuan)," "traveling to various countries," and "arriving at the southern Indian border"? He must have reached India via Myanmar.

    Myanmar is a place where Theravada Buddhism is prevalent. Certain Theravada Buddhist scriptures may have been introduced into China from Myanmar?. During the Tang Dynasty, Xuanzang and Yijing traveled in India for many years. Although they had not been to Myanmar, they both recorded the Sri Ksetra kingdom in their writings?. In the biography of the monk Hui Lun written by Yijing, he mentioned the China Temple in India. He said: "The elders have passed down that the great King Sri Gupta built it for the monks of the China Kingdom." He also said: "At that time, there were about twenty Tang monks who came out of the Zang Zang Road in Shu (Sichuan) and worshiped at the Mahabodhi Temple." He speculated that "to this day it may be five (suspected to be three) hundred years"? Hui Lin believes that the "Zang Zang Road" mentioned here is a road going to India through Myanmar to the north?. That is to say: around the early Eastern Jin Dynasty, there were more than twenty monks who took the road through western Sichuan, crossed the Dadu River south, crossed the Jinsha River, reached Yao'an and Dayao, and then went west, passing through Baoshan, entering northern Myanmar, through the Arakan area, to the Assam area in eastern India. It can be seen that before the Tang Dynasty, monks had been traveling on this road.

    During the Song Dynasty, the unified Pagan dynasty in Myanmar had been established. In 1044, the Pagan king went to Dali to seek the Buddha's teeth and was warmly received by Dali. In 1106 (the fifth year of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty's Chongning reign), Pagan sent diplomatic envoys and monks. The Song Dynasty treated them as a great country and gave them high courtesy?. In 1156 (the twenty-sixth year of Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty's Shaoxing reign), the Pagan envoy presented three volumes of the Diamond Sutra in gold and silver script and three volumes of the Great Wrathful Virtue in gold script; the Song Dynasty reciprocated with embroidered clothes, golden swords, etc. At this time, the envoys of the two countries had not been interrupted?.

    During the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, although there were several unpleasant events between the rulers of the two countries, from the perspective of the entire period, the friendly exchanges between the people were still frequent, and the envoys of both sides were never interrupted.

    From the perspective of arts and crafts, the lacquerware, ivory carvings, colored umbrellas, and fans of the two countries, although they have their own national styles, there are many similarities in style, production techniques, and paintings. The ancient architecture of Myanmar, in our view, is not so unfamiliar, but rather quite familiar. All of this fully shows that in the long-term friendly exchanges between our two countries, there are mutual influences and mutual learning, and there have long been certain common factors.

    In the mid-19th century, imperialists successively invaded China and Myanmar, oppressing, enslaving, plundering, and exploiting us from military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. Colonialists attempted to gradually turn China and Myanmar into their colonies and semi-colonies; at the same time, they exhausted all means to sever the long-standing historical friendly relations between China and Myanmar. Due to the aggression and oppression of the colonialists, China and Myanmar were in a long-term state of economic backwardness and poverty.

    Since then, the peoples of China and Myanmar have launched a struggle against imperialism, following one after another, and it has never stopped. In the history of the struggle for independence and freedom, it has further made the peoples of the two countries sympathize with each other and care for each other, thus deepening the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    Due to the common experience of an entire century and the same history of struggle against colonialism, it has further inspired the peoples of China and Myanmar to recall and cherish the long-standing historical friendship between each other. It is precisely because of the same history of suffering from colonial aggression and oppression that the peoples of China and Myanmar will equally cherish the achievements of the joint struggle against colonialism and will continue to fight against imperialism and colonialism. This is the common foundation for friendly cooperation in the future.

    The long historical relationship between China and Myanmar and the neighbors on a common border of more than 2,000 li, enable the people of the two countries, in the continuous and long-term economic and cultural exchanges, to exchange what they have and promote each other, enriching the economic and cultural life of both sides, which increasingly deepens the friendship between each other.

    The Irrawaddy River symbolizes the deep historical friendship between the two countries and flows forever.

    中国和缅甸是紧密的邻邦，有二千多公里绵延不断的共同边界。虽说隔着崇山峻岭，山高水急，却是山连着山，水连着水，二千多年来，经过两国各族人民世世代代的友好往来，早已开辟了水陆往还的通道。沿着这些水陆通道，两国之间久已进行着经济文化的交流。
    一
    我国的《史记》里①，曾记载着这样的事情：
    大约是在公元前一三八年（汉武帝建元三年），张骞出使西域时，在大夏看到中国的邛（邛崃）竹杖和蜀（四川）布。他问这些东西是从那里来的？大夏的人说是来自东南几千里的身毒国，从那里蜀商手中买到的；他还听说邛西二千里就是身毒国。公元前一二六年（汉武帝元朔三年），张骞回国之后，说大夏在中国的西南，想来中国通商，但是，匈奴遮断了东来的道路。他认为如果开通了西南边地的路，就可以到身毒国（印度），这是一条近道。汉武帝派人开辟这条路线，走到滇（云南），被滇王留下了，没有能到身毒国。
    这次汉朝使者虽说没有能够从中国的西南到达印度，实际上说明在二千多年以前，西南人民从四川、云南到达缅甸，再经过缅甸通往印度及南海各国的交通线就早已存在了。
    我国《汉书》里又曾记载着由海道通往缅甸②，经过缅甸再往南海诸国的航线：
    “自日南障塞，徐闻、合浦船行可五月，有都元国；又船行可四月，有邑卢没国；又船行可二十余日，有谌离国；步行可十余日，有夫甘都卢国。自夫甘都卢国船行可二月余，有黄支国，民俗略与珠崖相类。……自黄支船行可八月到皮宗；船行可八月，到日南、象林界云。黄支之南，有已程不国，汉之译使自此还矣”。这里所说的邑卢没国、谌离国和夫甘都卢国，大都在现在的缅甸境内③。由此可知，纪元前一世纪，在缅甸境内已经建立了一些古代国家，且已和我国有了交往。鱼豢在《魏略》④里曾经说：
    “大秦道既从海北陆通，又循海而南，与交趾七郡外夷，北又有水道通益州、永昌，故永昌出异物。前世但论有水道，不知有陆道，今其略如此。”“有水道通益州、永昌”，这就是说，当时从中国的永昌通过太平江或瑞丽江，顺伊洛瓦底江，到缅甸去。
    这里，我不准备作详细的地理考证，只是想通过这些记载，说明在两汉、三国时代，不管从内陆或海上，我国和缅甸都已经存在着友好往来的通道。
    从此，我国和缅甸的交往，适应着两国社会历史的发展变化，或经陆路，或经海道，时而陆路较多，时而海航往返，彼此之间的交往，一直不曾间断。
    到了唐代，我国和缅甸的交往日益频繁，海陆交通，皆已大备。关于交通路线的记载，也就更加详细了。贾耽的记录就是有力的论据⑤：
    “自羊苴羊城（大理）西至永昌故郡三百里，又西渡怒江（Sal-woon）至诸葛亮城二百里，又南至乐城二百里，又入骠国境，经万公等八部落至悉利城七百里，又经突旻城至骠国（Pro me）千里，又自骠国西度黑山，至东天竺迦摩波国（Kamarupa）千六百里，又西北渡迦罗都河（Karatoya）至奔那伐檀那国（Pundavarhana）六百里，又西南至中天竺国东境恒河（Gangos）南岸羯朱?罗国（Kajangala）四百里，又西至摩羯陀国（Magdha）六百里。“一路自诸葛亮城西去腾充城二百里，又西至弥城百里，又西过山二百里至丽水城，乃西渡丽水（Iravaddy）、龙泉水二百里至西安城，乃西渡弥诺江（Chidwin）水千里至大秦婆罗门国，又西渡大岭三百里至东天竺北界箇没卢国（Kamapupa），又西南千二百里至中天竺东北境之奔那伐檀国，与骠国往婆罗门路合。”
    上面所记，虽说是唐代的路线，实际上，它必然是唐以前存在着的路线之记录。在唐代的前后，两国习惯交界处的人民沿着群山中的河流、山路，来来往往，互通的道路决不止此，这只不过是一个不完全的记录而已。我们透过这段记录，可以看出当时我国的大理、永昌已经成为通往缅甸的重要城市，同时，经过缅甸伊洛瓦底江一带和其他各国频繁交往；在当时伊洛瓦底江的口岸不仅是缅甸和各国交往的要地，而且为我国通往海外各国给予极大的便利。
    我们可以说，自唐代以来，我国和缅甸的海陆交通已经大体上形成了。从此历经宋、元、明清，两国的交往日益密切，海陆交通的路线也逐渐比较完备了。
    自古以来，通过这一些海陆交通的路线使两国人民的经济文化的友好往来，一天天的密切起来。
    二
    从古以来，我国和缅甸两国人民在经济上互通有无，经历了千辛万苦，开辟了来往的通路；道路的开辟，又促进了经济的以及文化的交往。这些道路，经过长期的往还，逐步形成为我国和东南亚各国贸易往来的畅通的路线之一。
    我国魏晋时代，云南的永昌成为通向缅甸伊洛瓦底江的必经之地，大量的商品经过这里运往东南亚各国，同时，把缅甸及东南亚各国的商品送往内地。所以，当时的人说：“永昌出异物。”
    骠国是那时缅甸境内的国家之一，它的都城——室利差咀罗（今卑缪Prame）成为贸易集散的要地；沿伊洛瓦底江，溯流而上，江畔的缅甸古都太公城（Taganng）成为往来商人休息站，海岸上的直通城成为当时缅甸和我国、印度以及东南亚各国贸易往来的商业城市。⑥
    缅甸所产的棉花，在很久以前，就传入了我国；缅甸出产宝石，最著名的有琥珀、瑟瑟等，很早就输入到我国来了。
    棉花，是人们生活所必需的东西；在晋朝就确知骠国产棉。郭恭义说：“梧桐有白者，骠国有白桐木，其华有白；取其毳，淹渍缉绩，织以为布。”⑦
    桐木，也就是棉花。这里说明棉花在缅甸已有很久的历史，且久已从永昌传到了我国的内地，诗人左思还以“布有橦华”称赞过这种棉花织成的布。
    缅甸棉花一直是输入我国西南的主要商品之一。一八二六年还输入一千四百万磅。价值二十二万八千英镑⑧。此后，帝国主义侵入我们两国，这种情况才起了变化。
    汉朝的皇帝曾派人带着“黄金、杂缯”，经海道去东南亚各国，换取“明珠、璧琉璃、奇石、异物”⑨，到了当时缅甸境内的国家——邑卢没国和夫甘都卢国，就已经知道那里产宝石。
    元、明两代，我国和缅甸的玉石珠宝贸易，极为繁荣，云南的腾冲成为缅甸北部玉石的加工场所。经过缅甸的许可，我国有不少人到缅甸去开采玉石，运到腾冲，制成装饰品，运销我国。那时期，在缅甸的云南玉石珠宝商竟达百多家。缅甸的阿摩拉普拉古城的一个庙里，还保存载着清代的五千中国玉石商人名字的刻石。在过去，缅甸缺乏铜铁。缅甸商人以玉石珠宝换取铜铁；我国每年有上千的人把大量的剪刀、缝纫用针、铜罗、铁锅等用具运往缅甸⑩。这种互通有无的友好往来，丰富了两国人民的生活，加强了两国人民的友谊。
    象是缅甸的特产，白象，缅甸认为最高贵的动物；在两国使节相互交往的时候，缅甸常常用这类珍贵的特产作为礼品，赠送我国，这正体现着两国人民之间的深厚的友情。
    正因为我们两国有着绵长的边境，那里，山连山，水连水，村寨毗邻，两国边民之间，往往有着相同的血统语言，风俗习惯；早已是亲友往还了。我们正是通过交界的两国人民的推动，展开了长期的频繁的经济往来，这就必然促进两国间的文化上的交流。
    三
    缅甸和我国在文化艺术的交流上，有着悠久的历史。
    公元九七年（汉和帝永元九年）的时候，掸国——当时缅甸境内的国家之一，曾经派使臣来到汉朝的都城；一二○年（汉安帝永宁元年），掸国又派遣使节，随之而来的有乐队和演幻术的人。这些幻术的演员能够“吐火，自支解易牛马头，又善跳丸，数乃至千?”。缅甸自古以来就是爱好音乐的国家，音乐家之来，对我国古代的音乐当然会有一定的影响。在这些记载里，还记着这些演幻术的人“自言我海西人，海西即大秦也”的话，所以有人也怀疑这些幻术家可能不是掸国的人；他们是随同掸国的使者来的。但，即使是大秦的幻术家，而掸国竟选了他们前来汉朝表演，足证这种幻术在掸国已经有了相当影响。我想，这种为人民所爱好的幻术——艺技，很可能在当时的掸国已成为一种民间艺术。
    说到这里，我联想起汉代所流行的“都卢寻橦”之戏。张衡曾提到“都卢寻橦”，并说：“橦末之伎，态不可弥”?，且说：“非都卢之轻趫，孰能超而究升”。“寻橦”是一种缘竿的艺技。这种杂技，为什么称之为“都卢寻橦”呢？都卢是国名，因为都卢国的人“劲捷善缘高”，所以称云“都卢寻橦”。都卢国就是夫甘都卢国?。它正是当时缅甸境内的国家之一。当时把这种缘竿的艺技和缅甸境内的国家之一联系起来，说明那时候的都卢国存在着这种艺技。傅玄曾经绘形绘色地描写这种艺技：
    “乃有材童妙伎，都卢迅足，缘修竿而上下，形既变而影属；忽跟桂而倒绝，若将堕而复续，虬萦龙蜓，委随纡曲；杪竿首而腹旅，承严节之繁促。”?
    至于跳丸的艺技，在文人的笔下也常常见到，李尤说：“临高履索，踊跃旋舞，飞丸跳剑，沸渭回扰?。
    这种“都卢寻橦”、“跳丸跳剑”的艺技，在汉代是相当普遍的。直到现在，在汉代遗留下来的石刻画象及画象砖上，还常常发见这些艺技的各种图象?。
    这里，我们不必要去探讨这种“吞刀吐火”、“都卢寻橦”、“飞丸跳剑”等等艺技“起源那个国家，传播到那个国家”的问题，也不想去摸索谁影响了谁”的问题；我们所重视的，却是在纪元前，两国之间就相互交流着这种民间的艺技，那么，在这种艺技之外，必然会存在着其他方面的文化交流。
    大约在五世纪左右，缅甸境内的骠国相当繁荣，它离我国的永昌约二千里。它“东邻陆真腊，西接东天竺，西南堕和罗，南属海，北南诏。地长三千里，广五千里。”“往东通联加罗婆提等二十国”。?后来骠国和唐朝的往来也多起来了。
    公元801年（唐贞元十七年）骠国的使节舒难陀来到唐朝的都城长安。这次他带来了一个三十五人组成的大音乐舞蹈团。这里包括他们的国乐十二曲：“佛印”、“赞婆罗”、“白鸽”、“白鹤游”，“斗羊胜”，“龙首独琴”，“禅定”，“甘蔗王”，“孔雀王”，“野鹅”，“宴乐”和“涤烦”：携有二十二种不同的乐器：有铃钹四，有击礚应节铁板二，有螺见四，有凤首匏二，有鼍首筝二，有龙琵琶一，有云首琵琶一，有大匏琴二，有独弦匏琴，有小匏琴二，有横笛二，有大匏笙二，有小匏笙二，有三面鼓二，有小鼓四，有矛笙，有三角笙，有两角笙等。这个音乐舞蹈团在长安演出之后，真是轰动一时，不少著名的文学家为此留下了诗篇；元稹、白居易都写有“骠国乐”。白居易用这样的诗句形容骠国的歌舞：
    “玉螺一吹椎髻耸，铜鼓一击文身踊；珠缨炫转星宿摇，花鬘斗薮龙蛇动。”?胡直钧在太常观看了这种歌舞的表演，曾说：
    “才可宫商辨，殊惊节奏新，转规绣面，曲折度文身。”?
    在《新唐书》的《骠国传》里用相当大的篇幅叙述这次演出，从乐曲的配合，舞蹈的情形、乐器种类等等，各方面都有详细的记录。当时还记载着他们且歌且舞的姿态：
    “每为曲皆齐声唱，各以两手十指，齐开齐敛，为赴节之状，一低一昂，未尝不相对，有类中国柘枝舞。”?
    西川节度使韦皋在成都曾经看到骠国歌舞团的“舞容”和乐器都很新颖，还绘成“骠乐图”，送到长安。这样歌舞的演出，当然会给我国的音乐和舞蹈以相当的影响。
    在史籍里曾说这些“乐曲皆演释氏经论之词意。”?
    骠国和天竺国是近邻，所以它的音乐和舞蹈都受到了佛教的影响。佛教在汉代就已传入中国，从魏晋南北朝到隋唐，印度和中亚细亚的佛教徒从海路或陆路前来中国传教，而中国的佛教徒也常常从陆路或海路前往西域。佛教在南北朝到隋唐可以说是极盛的时期，对我国以后的文化有着相当大的影响。
    那时期，永昌既已成为我国经缅甸通往东南亚及西南各国的陆行要道之一，印度和我国的佛教信徒，完全可能经过这条路把佛教经典介绍过来。东晋的僧徒慧睿曾游方而学”，“经行蜀之西界”，“游历诸国”，“至南天竺界”?。他当然是经过缅甸到达印度的。
    缅甸是小乘佛教通行之地，某些小乘佛教经典很可能曾从缅甸传入中国?。唐代的玄奘和义净，曾先后在印度游历多年。他们虽说没有到过缅甸，但是，在他们的著作里都记载着室利差咀罗国?。义净为僧徒慧轮作的传里，曾提到印度的支那寺。他说：“古老相传云，是昔室利笈多大王为支那国僧所造”。且说：“于时有唐僧二十许人，从蜀川牂戕道而出，向摩呵菩提礼拜”。他推测“至今可五（疑为三字）百年”?慧琳认为这里所说“牂戕道”，就是经道缅甸向北部去印度的一条路?。这就是说：大约在东晋初年，曾经有僧徒二十余人，取道西蜀，过大渡河南下，渡金沙江，至今姚安、大姚，然后西行，经过保山，入缅甸北部，经阿拉甘一带，至印度东部的阿萨密地方。可见，唐代以前就有僧徒从这条道往来了。
    宋代的时候，在缅甸统一的蒲甘王朝业已建立。一○四四年蒲甘国王到大理求取佛牙，受到大理的友好接待。一一○六（宋徽宗崇宁五年），蒲甘派来了外交使节和僧人，宋朝以大国视之，礼遇甚崇?。一一五六年（宋绍兴二十六年）蒲甘使者赠送了金银书金刚经三卷，金书大威德三卷；宋朝回赠绣衣、金剑等。这时候，两国使节并未中断?。
    到了元、明、清时代，两国统治者之间虽说曾经发生过几次不愉快的事件，但是从整个时期看来，人民间的友好往来还是经常的，双方使节，从未间断。
    从工艺美术上看，两国的漆器、象牙雕刻、彩伞以及扇子等等，虽说具有各自的民族风格，但是，无论在风格上、制作的手法上，以及彩画上，都有不少相似之处。缅甸的古代建筑，在我们看来，并不是那么生疏，反而感到相当熟悉。所有这些都充分说明，我们两国长期的友好往来中，相互影响，相互观摩，这里面早已存在着某些共同的因素了。
    十九世纪中叶，帝国主义者先后侵入了我国和缅甸，从军事、政治、经济文化各方面来压迫、奴役、掠夺、剥削我们，也同样的压迫、奴役、剥削、掠夺缅甸。殖民主义者企图把我国和缅甸逐步变作它们的殖民地、半殖民地；同时，它们用尽一切办法，隔断中缅两国悠久的历史的友好关系。由于殖民主义者的侵略和压迫，使中缅两国长期陷于经济落后、生活贫困的状况。
    从那时起，中缅两国的人民就掀起了反对帝国主义的斗争，前赴后继，一直没有停止下来。在为着独立和自由而进行斗争的历史中，更加使两国人民互相同情，互相关怀，因而也就加深了两国人民间的传统的友谊。
    由于在整整一世纪的共同遭遇，同样的反对殖民主义的斗争历史，这就更加激发中缅两国的人民，回忆并珍重相互间的悠久的历史友情。正因为有着遭受殖民主义侵略和压迫的相同的历史，中缅两国人民同样会珍视共同反对殖民主义的斗争业绩，同样将继续为反对帝国主义和殖民主义而斗争，这正是今后友好合作的共同基础。
    中缅两国的悠久的历史关系，二千多里的共同边界的近邻，使两国人民之间，在连绵不断的长期的经济和文化交流的日子里，互通有无、相互促进，丰富了双方的经济生活和文化生活，这就日益加深了相互间的友情。
