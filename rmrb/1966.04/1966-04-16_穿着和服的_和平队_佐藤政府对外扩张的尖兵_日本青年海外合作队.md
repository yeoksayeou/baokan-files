    The Sato government and its backers, the Japanese monopoly capitalists, in order to expand into Asia and Africa, especially Southeast Asia, are following the American imperialists' practice of sending out "Peace Corps," creating pretexts, and stepping up the use of Japanese youth as a spearhead for their neo-colonialist expansion.

    As early as 1963, the Japanese government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party established the "Special Committee for Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers" to prepare for the formation of a Japanese version of the "Peace Corps." Sato accelerated activities in this area after taking office. In April of last year, the Sato government established the so-called "Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers." Then, on June 10, it established the "Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers Council" to be responsible for the implementation of dispatch work. The regular organizational work of the "Cooperation Corps" is handled by an affiliated body of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Just like the American imperialist "Peace Corps," the Japanese "Cooperation Corps" is also under the guise of "helping underdeveloped countries develop their economies and improve people's livelihoods," infiltrating production, communications, transportation, culture and education institutions in some Asian and African countries to serve the expansion policies of Japanese monopoly capital and militarism.

    In order to recruit troops and buy horses for the Japanese "Cooperation Corps," the Sato government used money and benefits to massively lure Japanese youth. On June 10 last year, Sato personally came forward to preach to Japanese youth: "The world is vast, Asia is vast, you should face Asia and soar overseas." Later, after about half a year of recruitment and training, Japan dispatched the first batch of thirty-one "workers" to countries and regions such as the Philippines, "Malaysia", and Laos (Vientiane authorities) at the end of last year. The Sato government plans to send another 150 people to Southeast Asian countries this year, and is also preparing to send 30 people to Africa. At the same time, Japanese monopoly capital also plans to dispatch an "Operational Management Personnel Peace Corps" to Southeast Asia and other places. These personnel will serve as factory manager assistants or deputy factory managers in the local area, so as to cooperate with the entire economic penetration and further directly control local factories and enterprises.

    In addition to the "Japan Overseas Cooperation Volunteers", the Sato government also dispatched "medical teams" and "lecture groups" to step up cultural aggression and penetration into Southeast Asia. The Sato government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party claimed that the purpose of dispatching "medical teams" was to promote the sale of large quantities of surplus medicines and so-called "improving the feelings of Southeast Asian countries towards Japan." The "lecture groups" sent by Japan to Southeast Asia set up "Japanese Studies Lectures" in the local area to carry out deceptive propaganda.

    The Sato government's dispatch of the Japanese version of the "Peace Corps" not only learned from the American imperialists, but also has its own aggressive traditions of Japanese militarism. In the past, when Japanese militarism invaded China, Japanese fascists organized "Manchuria-Mongolia Development Volunteer Army" and "Patriotic Youth Corps" to drive young people to serve its continental expansion policy of invading China. People still have vivid memories of this. (Originally)

### 穿着和服的“和平队”——佐藤政府对外扩张的尖兵“日本青年海外合作队”

    穿着和服的“和平队”
    ——佐藤政府对外扩张的尖兵“日本青年海外合作队”
    佐藤政府及其后台日本垄断资本，为了向亚非地区特别是东南亚进行扩张，仿照美帝国主义派出“和平队”的干法，巧立名目，加紧驱使日本青年充当其新殖民主义扩张的尖兵。
    早在一九六三年，日本政府和执政的自由民主党，就成立了“日本青年海外合作队特别委员会”，着手筹备组成日本版“和平队”的工作。佐藤上台后加速了这方面的活动。去年四月佐藤政府成立了所谓“日本青年海外合作队”。接着，六月十日又成立了“日本青年海外合作队协议会”，负责执行派遣工作。而“合作队”的经常组织工作则由日本外务省（外交部）的一个附属机构负责。就象美帝国主义“和平队”那样，日本的“合作队”也是在“帮助不发达国家发展经济和改善民生”的幌子下，打入一些亚非国家的生产、通讯、交通运输、文化教育等机构内，为推行日本垄断资本和军国主义的扩张政策服务。
    佐藤政府为了给日本“合作队”招兵买马，以金钱、待遇大肆诱骗日本青年。在去年六月十日，佐藤亲自出马向日本青年鼓吹：“世界是广阔的，亚洲是广阔的，你们要面向亚洲，应当向海外雄飞。”后来，经过半年左右时间的招募和训练，日本在去年底向菲律宾、“马来西亚”、老挝（万象当局）等国家和地区派出了第一批“工作队员”三十一人。佐藤政府并计划在今年向东南亚国家再派出一百五十人，另外还准备向非洲派三十人。同时，日本垄断资本还打算派遣“经营管理人员和平队”前往东南亚等地。这些人员将在当地担任工厂的厂长助手或副厂长，借以配合整个的经济渗透，进一步直接控制当地的工厂企业。
    除了“日本青年海外合作队”外，佐藤政府还派遣“医疗队”和“讲师团”，加紧对东南亚进行文化侵略和渗透。佐藤政府和执政的自由民主党宣称，派遣“医疗队”的目的是推销大批剩余医药品和所谓“改善东南亚国家对日感情”。日本派往东南亚的“讲师团”，则在当地开设“日本研究讲座”，进行欺骗宣传。
    佐藤政府派出日本版的“和平队”，不仅是从美帝国主义那里学的乖，而且有着日本军国主义自己的侵略传统。当年在日本军国主义侵略中国时，日本法西斯就曾组织过“满蒙开拓义勇军”、“爱国青年团”，驱使青年为其侵略中国的大陆扩张政策服务。对此人们记忆犹新。　（原）
