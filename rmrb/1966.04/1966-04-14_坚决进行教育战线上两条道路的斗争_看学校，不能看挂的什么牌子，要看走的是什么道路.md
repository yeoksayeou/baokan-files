    Editor's Note: How to carry out teaching reform in full-time primary and secondary schools is a problem that the broad masses of education workers urgently need to solve. The experiences of Zong'ai Primary School and Nantong No. 1 Middle School in teaching reform are very enlightening. The practice of these two schools shows that: teaching reform, of all things, putting politics first is the most important. If we do not put politics first and only focus on teaching reform from a professional point of view, we will inevitably have many concerns, waver back and forth, and change left and right, which is equivalent to not changing. Only by putting politics first, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and taking class struggle and the struggle between the two lines as the key link, can we truly reform well.
    Why?
    Teaching reform seems to be a teaching business issue, but it is actually a major political issue. Those with bourgeois educational ideas want to run education according to the bourgeois worldview, while we want to run education according to the proletarian worldview. This struggle is currently concentrated in teaching reform. Teaching reform is related to who education serves and what kind of people it cultivates? Is it related to gradually narrowing the gap between mental and physical labor, or gradually widening the gap between the two? That is, is it a fundamental issue of gradually transitioning to communism or regressing to capitalism? This is a serious class struggle and struggle between two roads in the ideological field.
    The matter is so clear. If we want to adhere to the socialist direction in education, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to command teaching reform, vigorously promote proletarian educational thought, and vigorously eliminate bourgeois educational thought.

    Look at Schools, Not at What Kind of Signboard They Hang, But at What Road They Are Taking

    To carry out teaching reform, we must put politics first and use politics to command business. In the past year or two of practice, we have gradually gained experience in this issue.
    Last year, when we started to carry out teaching reform, we did not first grasp ideological and political work. Therefore, after changing back and forth, we still could not jump out of the bourgeois framework of "education for education's sake." During study and discussion, we only talked about which subjects to test or not, whether there was too much homework, only remembering "several prohibitions" and "several do nots," without fundamentally looking at the political significance of teaching reform, so we formed a phenomenon of waiting for methods, moving methods, and changing methods without changing ideas. Later, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's instructions on education work, first clarified the relationship between education and class struggle, the relationship between education and socialist revolution, and gradually realized that further implementing the Party's education policy and carrying out teaching reform is a need of the three major revolutionary movements, has the significance of preventing and opposing revisionism, and is conducive to gradually narrowing the gap between mental and physical labor. Once the starting point changed, we clearly recognized the harm of "education for education's sake," criticized the one-sided pursuit of enrollment rates and the ideas of "intellectual education first" and "intellectual education only," and realized that running proletarian education or running bourgeois education, is it cultivating laborers with socialist consciousness and culture, or cultivating intellectuals full of bourgeois ideas, is it gradually narrowing the gap between mental and physical labor, or widening the gap between mental and physical labor, this is the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism on the education front. Many teachers said: "Schools cannot be judged by what kind of sign they hang, but by what road they take," "Influenced by bourgeois educational thought, sometimes we 'unconsciously' helped socialism 'backfire'," and began to feel that teaching must be reformed, and no longer just discussed things as they were.
    We have some understanding of the political significance of teaching reform, but we have not had much contact with the three major revolutionary movements, and we are not clear enough about what kind of successors the revolution needs. What is a cultured laborer with socialist consciousness? Why is it necessary to enable students to develop actively, lively and vigorously in moral, intellectual and physical aspects? We are still not aware enough. So we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, organized teachers and students to go to factories and the countryside to work, visited factories and communes, had joint celebrations with the People's Liberation Army, and had discussions with advanced figures among workers, peasants, and soldiers. At the same time, we investigated the performance of graduates in the three major revolutionary movements after they participated in work. From practice, we realized that Chairman Mao's instructions on training goals are very correct. However, the students we have trained cannot yet meet the needs of the three major revolutions. From practice, we realized that our past understanding of all-round development was not based on revolution: moral education only focused on "small virtues," without clearly using Mao Zedong Thought to arm students, so that they could be thoroughly revolutionary and never change color; intellectual education focused on rote memorization, without truly paying attention to linking theory with practice, cultivating knowledge and abilities to grasp the three major revolutionary movements; physical education was not from the perspective of enhancing students' physical fitness, so that they could endure great hardship and hard work in the three major revolutionary movements, but thought that it was enough to be without illness. In this way, we felt the necessity of teaching reform even more, realizing that not only the teaching methods should be changed, but the teaching ideology should be changed first.
    In the specific practice of teaching reform, we have realized that teaching work must highlight politics, understand the political purpose and political significance of our work, link specific work with the entire revolutionary cause, proceed from the revolution, implement the Party's education policy, and cannot just discuss things as they are.

### 坚决进行教育战线上两条道路的斗争  看学校，不能看挂的什么牌子，要看走的是什么道路

    编者按：在全日制中小学校里，怎样进行教学改革，这是广大教育工作者迫切需要解决的问题。宗艾小学和南通市第一中学教学改革的体会，对人很有启发。这两个学校的实践说明：教学改革，千条万条，突出政治是首要的一条。不突出政治，只从业务着眼进行教学改革，势必顾虑重重，摇摇摆摆，左改右改，等于不改。突出政治，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以阶级斗争、两条道路斗争为纲，进行教学改革，才能真正改好。
    为什么？
    教学改革看来是个教学业务问题，其实是个重大的政治问题。有资产阶级教育思想的人，想按照资产阶级的世界观办教育，我们则要按照无产阶级的世界观办教育。这一斗争，在当前来说，集中地表现在教学改革上。教学改革关系教育为谁服务，培养什么样的人？关系逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，还是逐步扩大这两者之间的差别？也就是关系是逐步向共产主义过渡，还是向资本主义倒退的根本问题。这是一场意识形态领域里的严重的阶级斗争和两条道路的斗争。
    事情就是这样明摆着的。我们要在教育工作中坚持社会主义方向，就一定要用毛泽东思想统帅教学改革，大兴无产阶级教育思想，大灭资产阶级教育思想。
    坚决进行教育战线上两条道路的斗争
    看学校，不能看挂的什么牌子，要看走的是什么道路
    搞教学改革，要突出政治，以政治统帅业务。对这个问题，我们在最近一两年的实践中，逐步有了体会。
    前年，我们在开始着手进行教学改革时，没有首先抓思想政治工作。因此，改来改去，仍然跳不出资产阶级的“为教育而教育”的框框。学习讨论时，只是议论什么科目考不考，课外作业多不多，只是记住“几个禁止”，“几个不要”，不去从根本上看教学改革的政治意义，所以就形成等方法、搬方法、改方法而不改思想的现象。后来，我们认真学习了毛主席关于教育工作的指示，首先弄清了教育和阶级斗争的关系，教育和社会主义革命的关系，逐步体会到进一步贯彻执行党的教育方针，进行教学改革，是三大革命的需要，具有防修、反修的意义，有利于逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别。立足点一改变，就比较清楚地认识到“为教育而教育”的危害性，批判了片面追求升学率和“智育第一”、“智育唯一”的思想，认识到办无产阶级教育，还是办资产阶级教育，是培养有社会主义觉悟有文化的劳动者，还是培养充满资产阶级思想的知识分子，是逐步缩小脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，还是扩大脑力劳动和体力劳动的差别，这是教育战线上的社会主义与资本主义两条道路的斗争。不少教师说：“学校不能看挂的是什么牌子，要看走的是什么道路”，“受资产阶级教育思想所影响，有时我们对社会主义帮了‘倒忙’也不自觉”，开始感到教学非改革不可，不再就事论事了。
    对教学改革的政治意义有所认识了，但我们对三大革命运动接触不多，对革命需要怎样的接班人，还不够明确。什么是有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者？为什么一定要使学生在德、智、体诸方面主动的生动活泼的发展，还是认识不足。于是我们就反复学习毛主席的有关指示，用毛泽东思想作为武器，组织师生下厂、下乡劳动，参观工厂、公社，和解放军联欢，和工农兵中的先进人物座谈，同时调查了毕业生参加工作后，在三大革命运动中的表现。从实践中，我们体会到毛主席指示的培养目标是十分正确的。但我们所培养的学生，还不能适应三大革命的需要。从实践中我们觉察到过去对全面发展的认识还不是从革命出发的：对德育只注意“小德”，而没有明确要以毛泽东思想武装学生，使他们彻底革命，永不变色；对智育，偏重于死记硬背，而没有真正注意理论联系实际，培养掌握三大革命运动的知识、能力；对体育，还不是从增强学生体质，使他们能在三大革命运动中吃大苦、耐大劳着眼，而是认为无病就行。这样，就更感到教学改革的必要了，意识到不仅教学方法要改，首先教学思想要改。
    在教学改革的具体实践中，使我们体会到，教学工作必须突出政治，懂得自己工作的政治目的和政治意义，把具体工作同整个革命事业联系起来，从革命出发，贯彻执行党的教育方针，不能就事论事。
