    "The most urgent and important task at present is to organize an anti-imperialist united front on the basis of striving to restore national sovereignty and the 1963 democratic constitution, and with the fighting alliance of the working class and peasants as the core, as a tool to unite, mobilize and lead the vast majority of the Dominican people to carry out a just struggle against American aggression."
                          ——Statement by the Dominican June 14th Revolutionary Movement

    "Strive to establish an anti-imperialist united front, which should take the worker-peasant alliance as its axis, so that the unity of the people against imperialism and its allies has an organizational form, and possesses a strong armed force mainly composed of peasants and workers."
                  ——Resolution of the First Preparatory Congress of the Dominican People's Movement

    "The entire history of the patriotic war, the successive killings of constitutionalist soldiers, the suppression of the last strike, and the heinous crimes in Santiago, all show that the various patriotic classes and strata can no longer fight the American invaders each in their own way. It is necessary to establish an anti-imperialist and constitution-defending united front by mobilizing the people and actively carrying out the struggle against American imperialism, so as to respond to the reactionary suppression of the American devils and their running dogs with the revolutionary actions of the masses."
                                   ——Statement by the Dominican People's Movement

    "The working class is the most steadfast and resolute in the struggle against the American devils and for the 1963 Constitution. In this struggle, the main ally of the working class is the poor peasants and other exploited strata in the countryside. This worker-peasant alliance should be the foundation for the unity of the anti-American constitutional front."
                        ——Organ of the Dominican People's Movement, "Freedom Newspaper"

    "Where there is oppression, there is resistance. Because American imperialism and all other imperialists are aggressing against and oppressing the people of all countries in the world, the people of all countries in the world have the obligation and necessity to form a broad world anti-imperialist front, to increasingly encircle and isolate the main aggressive force of American imperialism and finally defeat it."
      ——Speech by the head of the Dominican delegation, Guido Gil, at the Tricontinental Conference

    必须建立以工农联盟为基础的反美统一战线
    “当前最紧迫和最重要的任务是，在争取恢复民族主权和一九六三年民主宪法的斗争基础上，并以工人阶级和农民的战斗联盟为核心，组织反帝统一战线，作为统一、动员和领导绝大多数多米尼加人民进行反对美国侵略的正义斗争的工具。”
                          ——多米尼加六月十四日革命运动声明
    “争取建立反帝统一战线，这个统一战线应以工农联盟为轴心，使人民反对帝国主义及其同盟者的团结具有组织形式，并拥有主要由农民和工人组成的强大的武装力量。”
                  ——多米尼加人民运动第一次预备代表大会决议
    “爱国战争的全部历史，陆陆续续杀害宪法派军人的事件，对上次罢工的镇压和圣地亚哥的骇人罪行，这一切都表明，各个爱国阶级和阶层再也不能各管各地反对美国入侵者。必须以动员人民和积极进行反对美帝国主义的斗争，来成立反帝护宪统一战线，以使用人民群众的革命行动来回答美国佬及其走狗的反动镇压。”
                                   ——多米尼加人民运动声明
    “工人阶级在反对美国佬、争取一九六三年宪法的斗争中最坚定、最坚决。在这场斗争中，工人阶级的主要同盟者是贫农和农村其他被剥削阶层。这种工农联盟应该是反美宪法阵线团结的基础。”
                        ——多米尼加人民运动机关报《自由报》
    “哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。由于美帝国主义和所有其他的帝国主义者侵略和压迫全世界各国人民，全世界各国人民就有义务和必要组成一条广泛的世界反帝战线，把主要的侵略势力美帝国主义越来越包围和孤立起来并最后打败它。”
      ——多米尼加代表团团长吉多·希尔在亚非拉三洲会议上发言
