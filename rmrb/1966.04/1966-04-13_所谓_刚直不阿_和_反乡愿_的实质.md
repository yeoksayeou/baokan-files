Title: The Essence of So-Called "Integrity and Uprightness" and "Anti-Hypocrisy"

    With the deepening of the socialist revolution, the contradiction between Comrade Wu Han's bourgeois worldview and socialist reality became increasingly profound. The struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eradicate bourgeois ideology in the ideological sphere, and the magnificent revolutionary mass movements, all aroused his dissatisfaction. Despite his skillful disguise, his dissatisfaction could no longer be concealed. He could not help but place his full sympathy and hope on the small handful of right-leaning opportunists who emerged at the time, and used the historical figure of Hai Rui as a tool, using the method of alluding to the present through the past to support these anti-Party and anti-socialist elements. In this way, his political face was exposed without a doubt.
    Comrade Wu Han found two magic weapons from Hai Rui. One is the spirit of "integrity and uprightness." He attempted to pass off fish eyes as pearls, using the "integrity and uprightness" of the feudal class to impersonate the revolutionary nature of the proletariat. His purpose was nothing more than to use this magic weapon to incite right-leaning opportunists to "petition for the people," to attack the Party and "try again after failure," and at the same time to fuel the reactionary arrogance of all landlords and bourgeois elements who were hostile to socialism. He called on these people to be as "upright" as Hai Rui and "carry out unyielding struggles" to oppose "today's bureaucratism" ("On Hai Rui"). Everyone knows that the Party often calls on us to fight against bureaucratism. But what kind of "bureaucratism" was Comrade Wu Han opposing? Although he was secretive, people could still explore the details. At that time, the Party was sounding the alarm to the people across the country, pointing out that the main danger at present was the thought of right-leaning opportunism, but Comrade Wu Han put forward the slogan of opposing "bureaucratism," which was in opposition to the call of the Party Central Committee. This cannot but make people alert to its pertinence and special meaning: what he opposed was our beloved Party.
    Comrade Wu Han's second magic weapon is opposing "hypocrisy." This magic weapon was ostensibly found from Hai Rui, but in reality, it was a rehash of the platitudes sung by the bourgeois rightists when they launched an attack on the Party in 1957. To put it bluntly, this was nothing more than using Hai Rui's corpse to revive the spirits of the rightists. Why did Comrade Wu Han pick up the tatters of the rightists again? This is because: he harbored a deep resistance to the revolutionary situation in which the people of the whole country firmly listened to the Party, followed the Party, and went wherever the Party pointed. Therefore, he wanted to put forward a sharply opposed slogan to describe all revolutionaries who were willing to be the Party's docile tools as "hypocrites of the old era" and "oppose" them, thereby weakening the Party's leadership, undermining the unity of the revolutionary ranks, and seeking a way out for the enemies of socialism. It is worth noting that this reactionary slogan was put forward immediately after the Party issued a call to oppose right-leaning tendencies. This was clearly an attempt to prevent people from responding to the Party's call and prevent people from carrying out serious criticism and struggle against right-leaning opportunists. In other words, it was to "escort" right-leaning opportunists.
    It can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's great praise for the historical figure of Hai Rui at that time, and his advocacy of his spirit of "integrity and uprightness" and his proposition of "anti-hypocrisy," was by no means just a question of idealistic historical view and morality. Through these, what kind of political views did Comrade Wu Han express, whose position did he stand on, and for whom was he working? Isn't it very obvious? No matter how concealed his methods are, as long as people compare them with the current situation of class struggle, it is not difficult to realize that his "serving the present by studying the past" is precisely used to sympathize with, support, and encourage right-leaning opportunists and all reactionary landlord and bourgeois elements to attack socialism.

    所谓“刚直不阿”和“反乡愿”的实质
    经群
    随着社会主义革命的深入，吴晗同志的资产阶级世界观同社会主义现实的矛盾愈来愈深刻。意识形态领域的兴无灭资斗争，规模壮阔的革命的群众运动，在在激起他的不满。尽管巧于伪装，他的这种不满情绪终于隐藏不住。他情不自禁地把满腔同情和希望寄托在当时冒出的一小撮右倾机会主义分子的身上，并以海瑞这个历史人物为工具，用借古非今的手法来为这些反党反社会主义分子撑腰打气。这样一来，他的政治面目就暴露无遗了。
    吴晗同志从海瑞那里找到了两件法宝。其一就是“刚直不阿”的精神。他企图鱼目混珠，以封建阶级的“刚直不阿”，冒充无产阶级的革命性。其目的不外是借用这个法宝鼓动右倾机会主义者“为民请命”，向党进攻和“失败了再干”，同时也以此助长一切敌视社会主义的地主资产阶级分子的反动气焰。他号召这些人要象海瑞那样“刚直”，“进行百折不挠斗争”，以反对“今天的官僚主义”（《论海瑞》）。大家都知道，党经常号召我们同官僚主义作斗争。但是吴晗同志所反对的究竟是什么样的“官僚主义”呢？尽管他讳莫如深，人们还是可以探索出其中的底细。在当时，党正向全国人民敲起警钟，指出当前的主要危险是右倾机会主义的思想，而吴晗同志却提出反对“官僚主义”的口号，同党中央的号召相对立。这就不能不令人警觉到它的针对性和特殊涵义：他反对的正是我们亲爱的党。
    吴晗同志的第二个法宝就是反对“乡愿”。这个法宝表面上是从海瑞那里找来的，实际上是拣的资产阶级右派分子在一九五七年向党发动进攻时所唱过的滥调。说穿了，这不过是借海瑞之尸还右派之魂而已。吴晗同志为什么重新拾起右派分子的破烂呢？这是因为：他对全国人民坚决听党的话、跟党走、党指向那里就奔向那里的同心同德的革命形势，怀有深刻的抵触情绪。因此要提出一个针锋相对的口号来，把一切愿意做党的驯服工具的革命者，说成是“旧时代的乡愿”而加以“反对”，以由此而削弱党的领导，破坏革命队伍的团结，为社会主义的敌人寻求出路。值得注意的是，这个反动口号是紧接着党发出反右倾的号召后提出来的。这显然是企图阻止人们响应党的号召，反对人们向右倾机会主义分子进行严肃的批判和斗争。换言之，就是要为右倾机会主义者“保驾”。
    可见，吴晗同志在当时大事颂扬海瑞这个历史人物，鼓吹他的“刚直不阿”的精神和“反乡愿”的主张，这绝不只是唯心主义的历史观和道德观的问题。通过这些，吴晗同志表达了什么样的政治观点，他站在什么人的立场，在为谁效劳，不是十分明显的吗？不管他的手法如何隐蔽，只要拿现实的阶级斗争形势对照一下，人们就不难察觉他的“古为今用”，恰恰用在同情、支持和鼓动右倾机会主义分子和一切反动的地主资产阶级分子对社会主义的进攻。
