    Peasants See Through the Reactionary Essence of "Honest Officials"	Shi Geng
    Recently, some teachers and students from the semi-study, semi-work History Department of Northwest University conducted interviews and discussions with peasants on the "problem of honest officials" in the Zhongguanting, Housuo寨, Xixi, and Dongxi production brigades of the Liucun堡 commune in the suburbs of Xi'an. Some students also conducted interviews with peasants in their hometowns of Xingping, Chang'an, and other places. Based on their personal experiences, the poor and lower-middle peasants exposed the exploitative class nature of "honest officials" in a concrete and profound way, forming a sharp contrast with Comrade Wu Han's views.
      The Clear Class Stand of Peasants on the "Honest Official" Issue
    The peasants have a clear class stand and a clear sense of right and wrong on the issue of "honest officials," and the examples they cite are true and vivid. The vast majority of poor and lower-middle peasants hold views completely opposite to those of Comrade Wu Han on "honest officials." Through their own experiences, they have exposed the class nature of "honest officials" serving the exploiting classes.
  "Honest Officials" Are Loyal to the Emperor and Are the Deadly Enemies of the Poor
    In the materials we have learned about, many of the exposures of the reactionary essence of "honest officials" are folk songs. They reflect the clear conclusions drawn by the peasant masses in the practice of generations of class struggle. Some, facing the familiar hometown waters, sing: "Clear Water River, flows eastward, officials are the deadly enemies of the poor." Some say: "People don't become officials, officials are all the same; one emperor, one courtier, changing back and forth harms the poor."
    Many peasants pointed out sharply that "honest officials" are completely loyal to the emperor. Wang Bin, an old poor peasant from the Housuo寨 Brigade, said: "Speaking of 'honest officials,' you say they are 'honest,' they are honest to the emperor, they work for the emperor." Some also said: "Where are there officials for the poor, where are there laws for the poor; the king's law, the king's law, laws made by the king. The law is made by the king, the official is given by the king, you can't be an official if you don't work for the king. The king's law itself is eating human flesh and drinking human blood." "'Honest officials' are also loyal ministers, loyal to the emperor. 'Wise emperors' also like loyal ministers." When discussing Bao Zheng, everyone cited many stories of Bao Zheng suppressing peasant uprisings and being loyal to the emperor. Xiao Deming, the party branch secretary of Housuo寨 Brigade, said: "Bao Zheng's black gauze hat was given by the feudal dynasty, and if the people rose up in resistance, the black gauze hat would not be worn firmly. He wouldn't allow rebellion." In the eyes of the peasants, loyalty to the emperor and love for the people are incompatible. A folk song says it well: "'Bao Wenzheng, face turns blue, loyal to the emperor, loves the people,' who believes this, nonsense."
    "Honest Officials" and Corrupt Officials Equally Cruelly Exploit the People,
    "Honest Officials" Kill with Wooden Knives, Corrupt Officials Kill with Steel Knives
    When talking about the difference between "honest officials" and corrupt officials, the poor and lower-middle peasants said, "They are the same gang of bandits," "a bunch of bandits," and their ruling methods are different. "Corrupt officials kill with steel knives, that's flaying alive; 'honest officials' kill with wooden knives, making people suffer alive - can't die, can't live well."
      Both "honest officials" and corrupt officials cruelly exploit the people. Wang Shengfa, a poor peasant from Housuo寨 Brigade, said: "Officials are there to scrape money, who has seen an official who doesn't love money in the old society. Where does the good food and clothing of officials come from? How much silver do they have to get every year and every month! No matter how 'honest' an official is, they still have to ride in an eight-person sedan chair when they go out. There are also wet nurses, maids, and bookboys at home, how can they afford to use these people! 'Three years as a 'clean' prefect, one hundred thousand taels of silver.' Where does this money come from? Isn't it exploiting us poor people!" Some peasants also exposed the essence of "honest officials" in terms of fame and gain, pointing out that "honest officials" serving the people is just a hypocritical guise. Wang Xin, a poor peasant from Housuo寨 Brigade, said: "'Honest officials' doing things for the people is like Yang Liulang killing his son - just for show. Some are greedy for profit, some are greedy for fame, with a 'Ten Thousand People Umbrella,' they can be promoted and make a fortune." Feng Junhe, a poor peasant youth from Zhongguanting Brigade, said: "In the past, officials were in a different position from the common people, they wanted to scrape money, they wanted to be promoted, they would never serve the broad masses of the people." They believe that the methods of "honest officials" to obtain wealth are more insidious and cunning. In order to get more wealth, they first take a name, the facade is decorated, the official is promoted, and there is more money. Some villagers cited examples of landlords in their villages donating money to repair temples and build schools before liberation, explaining that they were just trying to deceive people for honor and make a fortune. The peasants said: "Don't mention that gang doing things for the people, it's just to get some benefits for themselves."
    "Fair judgment" is a point that advocates of "honest officials" focus on. But how do the peasants comment on it? Shi Xingyuan, a poor peasant from Housuo寨 Brigade, said: "Officials always protect each other." They often question the circulating stories and dramas of "honest officials" and do not believe that such things exist. Many peasants cited their personal experiences to expose that "fair judgment" by "honest officials" is completely hypocritical. Bian Xunxun, a peasant from Nanwei Brigade, Nanwei Commune, Xingping County, said: "In the old society, I fought lawsuits with landlords for decades, and sold all my family property, but still ended up in jail. Before and after, I have never seen an 'honest official'." There was a poor peasant named Zhang Wenshan in Yaojia寨 Brigade, Yinzhen Commune, Chang'an County. In his grandfather's hands, all the land in his family was seized by the landlord. His grandfather and father filed lawsuits, but they were always beaten with boards and lost the lawsuits. In 1945, Zhang Wenshan heard that a new master came to the yamen who was an "honest official" and went to file a lawsuit again. This new master did not beat him with boards, but deceived him, pretending to promise "fair judgment according to reason," and told him to go home and wait. However, Zhang Wenshan waited year after year, and there was no news. After liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the landlords were overthrown, and the grievances of Zhang's three generations were redressed. Zhang Wenshan also thoroughly understood the truth that the officials of the exploiting classes are the deadly enemies of the poor, and that "all crows under the sky are equally black."
    Having Lived for Decades in the Old Society, I Haven't Seen Any "Honest Officials"
    Some other discussions of "honest officials" by the peasant masses reveal the essence of the problem from another angle. During the investigation, as soon as we asked about "honest officials," the peasants would cite the names of Bao Zheng, Lü Mengzheng, Wang Zhen, etc., whom they knew from dramas and stories. But as soon as they touched on their experiences in the old society, they denied the existence of "honest officials." Wang Bin, an old poor peasant, said: "I have lived for decades in the old society and haven't seen any 'honest officials'." Wang Shengxiu, a poor peasant, said: "We haven't seen any 'honest officials' in ancient times, we only know that Chiang Kai-shek's officials were very blind." They said: "Anyway, we haven't seen any 'good officials'." They questioned the "honest official" legends: "Bao Gong in the plays distributes grain all his life, why do the poor people in the world always have nothing to eat? I think distributing grain is deceiving people." Some people narrated some "honest official" stories from old plays, believing that these stories were unreasonable and were just people writing plays to deceive poor peasants, telling them to wait peacefully for "honest officials" and not to resist.
    Why do the peasants see the essence of "honest officials" so clearly? Chairman Mao told us that people's correct ideas can only come from social practice, and people's social existence determines people's thinking. "Especially the class struggle in various forms gives a profound influence to the development of people's understanding. In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are branded with a class mark." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I, page 272) The practice of class struggle tells the peasants that the officials of the exploiting class state are their deadly enemies. Those fabricated and deceptive images of "honest officials," once touched by the reality of class struggle, are immediately smashed to pieces.
    From the materials investigated as a whole, the peasants clearly pointed out that "honest officials" and corrupt officials are both demons who oppress and exploit the people, and the actions of "honest officials" have nothing in common with the interests of the people.
    "Honest Officials" Are the Exploiting Class's Double Deception Tool
    Some peasants who have watched "honest official" plays and heard "honest official" stories believe that there were "honest officials" in feudal society who worked for the peasants. They often mentioned Kou Zhun in the old play "Tuning the Bandits", Wang Zhen in "Beating the Garrison Commander", Bao Zheng in "Qin Xianglian" and "Chopping Bao Mian", etc. as "evidence".
    How should we view this kind of view among the peasants? We conducted discussions and analysis with the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    From a phenomenal point of view, there are these characteristics: First, people believe in "honest officials" of times far away from the present. Second, the more people watch old plays and old novels, and the more they hear old books, the more they believe in "honest officials." Third, older people believe in "honest officials" more than younger people.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "We must look at the essence of things, and regard their phenomena only as guides to entry. Once we enter the door, we must grasp their essence. This is the reliable scientific method of analysis." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Volume I, page 103) We use the viewpoint of class struggle to analyze the characteristics of the above phenomena, and we will realize the essence of the problem: the existence of a vague understanding of the "honest official" issue among the peasants is a reflection of class struggle in the ideological field and is the remaining poison of deceptive propaganda by the exploiting classes.
    All past feudal rulers, while exercising violent rule over the peasants through their state apparatus, have always attached particular importance to promoting policies of keeping the people ignorant and carrying out deceptive propaganda, disguising the feudal state apparatus as something beyond class. This is an important means for the feudal ruling class to oppose peasant revolutions. The bourgeoisie also inherited this trick from the landlord class. When we discussed the issue of "honest officials" with the activists among the poor and lower-middle peasants, everyone pointed out that this deceptive propaganda activity includes two aspects: First, on matters that do not involve the fundamental interests of the exploitation system and the exploiting class, they intentionally do some "good deeds" and pretend to be "impartial," showing it to the people. This is deception in political struggle. Second, however, the exploiting classes are cruelly exploiting and oppressing the masses of the people at all times and places, and there are too few "good deeds" that can be used to pretend. They also racked their brains to fabricate history and concoct stories for deceptive propaganda. This is deception in ideological struggle. "Honest officials" are a tool for the exploiting classes to carry out double deception against the working people in political and ideological struggles.
    As a tool of deception in political struggle, "honest officials" are the specific executors of the soft hand of counter-revolution. This group of people is most loyal to the exploitation system and the entire exploiting class. In order to ensure the eternal existence of the exploitation system, and in order to gain fame and fortune and be promoted, they carry out various deceptive activities. During their tenure, they intentionally do some "good deeds," such as repairing bridges, paving roads, dredging rivers, and judging some unimportant cases. When they leave office, they also collude with local gentry and landlords to engage in ghost tricks such as "Ten Thousand People Umbrella" and "Leaving Boots". We heard some stories and legends in the countryside: Some people said that an "honest official" saw that a river often drowned people, so he mobilized laborers to build a bridge. Someone said that a county magistrate judged cases clearly, and when he judged cases, he invited peasants and citizens to stand on both sides of the hall to watch. It is said that there were indeed cases where poor people won lawsuits. But, what kind of cases were they? A landlord's glasses were bumped and broken by a poor man selling firewood, and the county magistrate did not ask the poor man to pay compensation. Several cases we learned about were similar.
    These are the so-called "good deeds" done by "honest officials" for the people. The credibility of these legends is extremely small. Even if we treat these legends as real, it is not difficult to see the essence of the deceptive activities of "honest officials." Repairing bridges requires the efforts of the masses and spends the money of the masses, in exchange for their own good reputation. This is completely deceiving people with the blood and sweat of the exploited. It is ridiculous to try a case like a pair of glasses in public to show the style of "honest officials"! More importantly, all these "good deeds" done by the "honest officials" are conducive to consolidating the rule of the exploiting classes, and do not touch the slightest actual interest of the exploiting classes and the exploitation system.
    As a tool of deception in ideological struggle, the "honest official" is a completely illusory image fabricated by the exploiting classes. The feudal emperors saw that "honest officials" played a particularly important deceptive role in paralyzing the revolutionary will of the people and consolidating the feudal order, and they greatly commended "honest officials." Especially after their death, they gave them various titles and rendered their "good words and deeds." The feudal ruling classes also particularly used their monopoly of cultural knowledge and control of the propaganda machine to shape the illusory image of "honest officials" through their cultural figures, describing "honest officials" as "honest and incorruptible," "clear as a mirror," "fair in law enforcement," and "impartial." A whole set of twenty-four histories wrote histories and biographies for large and small "honest officials," and a large number of old novels and old dramas sang praises for "honest officials." From feudal emperors to feudal literati, everyone worked together to instill the illusory image of "honest officials" that they concocted into the minds of the masses, with the purpose of making the oppressed and exploited masses believe that disasters were only caused by individual corrupt officials, and that good days would come when they met "honest officials."
    This illusory image of "honest officials" is not only fundamentally different from the corrupt officials in real life, but also cannot be compared to the actual behavior of those so-called "honest officials." It is infinitely beautified and elevated, so its deceptive effect is broader and deeper. As a double deception tool, the deceptive effect of "honest officials" in the ideological struggle is more needed by the ruling class, and the harm to the oppressed and exploited masses is deeper. Ask any older peasant, and he can tell you a lot of stories about Bao Gong and other public case novels and old plays. It is these that instilled poison into the peasants and confused some people.
    Speaking of this, we fully understand why people tend to believe in "honest officials" who lived in the distant past; why people who watch many old plays and old novels, and who hear many old books, tend to believe in "honest officials"; and why older people believe in "honest officials" more than younger people. Our conclusion is that the vague understanding of the class essence of "honest officials" existing among the masses is caused by the deceptive activities carried out by the exploiting classes in political and ideological struggles. The vague understanding of "honest officials" among peasants does not prove that "honest officials" "stand on the side of the peasants." On the contrary, it proves that "honest officials" play a particularly important deceptive role in safeguarding the interests of the exploiting classes.

### 农民看透了“清官”的反动本质

专栏：

    农民看透了“清官”的反动本质	史　耕
    最近，我们西北大学半耕半读历史系部分师生在西安市郊区六村堡公社的中官亭、后所寨、西席、东席四个生产大队，就“清官问题”向农民群众作了访问，同他们一起进行了讨论。还有一些同学在自己家乡兴平、长安等地的农民群众中作了访问。贫下中农从他们的亲身经历出发，具体而又深刻地揭露了“清官”的剥削阶级本质，与吴晗同志的观点形成尖锐对立。
      农民在“清官”问题上的鲜明阶级立场
    农民在“清官”问题上阶级立场鲜明，是非观念清楚，所举例证真实生动。广大贫下中农对“清官”的看法同吴晗同志完全相反。他们通过自己的经历，揭露了“清官”为剥削阶级服务的阶级本质。
  “清官”忠于皇帝，是穷人的死对头
    在我们了解到的材料中，揭露“清官”反动本质的很多是民谣。它们反映了农民群众在世代阶级斗争实践中获得的明确结论。有的面对着熟悉的乡水唱出：“清水河，向东流，当官的是穷人的死对头。”有的说：“为人不坐官，坐官都一般；一朝天子一朝臣，换来换去害穷人。”
    许多农民一针见血地指出，“清官”是完全忠心于皇帝的。后所寨大队老贫农王斌说：“说起‘清官’，你说他‘清’，他是对皇帝清，是为皇帝办事的。”有的还说：“哪里有穷人的官，哪里有穷人的法；王法王法，王订的法。法是王订的，官是王给的，不为王办事就当不上官。王法本身就是吃人肉喝人血的。”“‘清官’也都是忠臣，忠心皇上。‘明君’也喜欢忠臣。”谈到包拯的时候，大家列举了好多包拯镇压农民起义效忠皇上的故事。后所寨党支部书记萧德明说：“包拯的乌纱帽是封建朝廷给的，人民起来反抗，乌纱帽也就戴不牢了。他就不让反。”在农民看来，忠皇上和爱百姓是水火不相容的。一首歌谣说得好：“‘包文正，面发青，忠皇上，爱百姓’，谁信这，鬼念经。”
    “清官”和贪官同样残酷剥削人民，
    “清官”用木刀杀人，贪官用钢刀杀人
    在谈到“清官”和贪官的区别的时候，贫下中农说，“他们是一路子贼寇”，“一混子贼”，他们的统治手法不同。“贪官用钢刀杀人，这是活剥皮；‘清官’用木刀杀人，叫人活受罪——死呢死不了，活呢活不旺。”
      “清官”和贪官都残酷剥削人民。后所寨大队贫农王生发说：“当官是为了刮钱，旧社会谁见过不爱钱的官。当官的吃好的，穿好的从哪里来？每年每月要弄多少银子！官再‘清’，出去还要坐八人大轿。家里还有奶妈、丫环、书童一大堆人，咋能使唤得起这些人！‘三年清知府，十万雪花银。’这钱哪里来的？还不是剥削咱穷人的！”有的农民还揭露了“清官”在名利关系问题上的本质，指出“清官”为民只是个虚伪的幌子。后所寨大队贫农王新说：“‘清官’为百姓办事是杨六郎杀娃——做样子哩。有人贪利，有人贪名，有了‘万民伞’，就能升官发大财了。”中官亭大队贫农青年冯俊合说：“过去当官的，与老百姓的位置就不一样，他们要刮钱，要升官，绝不会为广大人民服务。”他们认为“清官”的取财手法更阴险，更狡猾。为了得到更多的财，他们首先取名，门面装饰好了，官升高了，钱就更多了。有些村子的农民列举出解放前本村的地主捐钱修庙宇、盖学校的事例，说明他们只是为了骗取荣誉、多发横财而已。农民说：“别再提那一伙子为民办事了，只是为了给自己弄点油水。”
    “断案公平”，这是“清官”论者着力宣扬的一点。但农民是怎样评论的呢？后所寨大队贫农史兴元说：“当官的都是官官相卫。”他们对流传的“清官”故事和戏常常提出疑问，不相信有这种事。许多农民举出了亲身的经历来揭露“清官”“断案公平”完全是虚伪的。兴平县南位公社南位大队农民边巡巡说：“在旧社会，我和地主打了几十年官司，把一份家产卖光了，结果还是坐庭子。前前后后，没有见过有一个‘清官’。”长安县引镇公社姚家寨大队有个贫农叫张文山。祖父手里，他家的全部土地就被地主霸占了，祖父和父亲两代人告状，总是挨板子，输官司。到了一九四五年，张文山听说衙门里来了个新老爷是“清官”，又去告状。这个新老爷确实没有打他的板子，却欺骗他，假装答应“以理公断”，叫他回家等着。可是，张文山等了一年又一年，一直没有消息。解放后，在共产党领导下，斗倒了地主，张家三代人的冤案才得到昭雪，张文山也才彻底懂得了剥削阶级的官都是穷人的死对头，“天下乌鸦一般黑”的真理。
    在旧社会活了几十年，没见过啥“清官”
    农民群众对“清官”的另一些议论，从另一个角度透露出问题的实质来。在调查过程中，我们一问到“清官”，农民就会举出从戏文、故事中知道的包拯、吕蒙正、王震等名字来。但是一接触到他们在旧社会的经历，他们就否认“清官”的存在。老贫农王斌说：“我在旧社会活了几十年，还没见过啥‘清官’。”贫农王生秀说：“古时候有没有‘清官’咱没见过，咱只知道蒋匪的官瞎得很。”他们说：“反正咱没有见过啥‘好官’。”他们对“清官”传说提出疑问：“戏上的包公成辈子放粮，为什么天下穷人老没吃的？我看放粮是哄骗人。”有的群众叙述了旧戏上的一些“清官”故事，认为这些故事都不合情理，不过是编戏的人哄骗穷苦农民，叫他们安心等待“清官”，不要反抗。
    农民为什么对“清官”的本质看得这样透呢？毛主席告诉我们，人的正确思想只能从社会实践中来，人们的社会存在决定人们的思想。“尤以各种形式的阶级斗争，给予人的认识发展以深刻的影响。在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷第二七二页）阶级斗争的实践告诉农民，剥削阶级国家的官吏都是他们的死对头。那些捏造出来骗人的“清官”形象，一触及阶级斗争的实际，立即被碰得粉碎。
    从整个调查到的材料看，农民明确地指出了“清官”和贪官都是压迫剥削人民的魔王，“清官”的作为与人民利益毫无共同之处。
    “清官”是剥削阶级的双重欺骗工具
    也有一些农民看了“清官”戏，听了“清官”故事，认为封建社会里有为农民办事的“清官”。他们经常提到旧戏《调寇》中的寇准、《打镇台》中的王震、《秦香莲》、《铡包勉》中的包拯等作为“证据”。
    怎样看待农民中的这类看法呢？我们和贫下中农进行了讨论和分析。
    从现象上看，有这样几个特点：第一，离现在远的时代的“清官”，有人相信。第二，越是看旧戏、旧小说多的，听说旧书多的，相信“清官”的就越多。第三，老年人比青年人相信“清官”的多一些。
    毛主席教导我们说：“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导，一进了门就要抓住它的实质，这才是可靠的科学的分析方法。”（《毛泽东选集》第一卷，第一○三页）我们用阶级斗争观点分析上述现象的特点，就会认识到问题的实质：农民中存在着对“清官”问题的模糊认识，是思想领域内阶级斗争的一种反映，是剥削阶级欺骗宣传的遗毒。
    历来的封建统治者，在凭其国家机器对农民施行暴力统治的同时，又总是特别重视推行愚民政策，进行欺骗宣传，把封建的国家机器打扮成超阶级的东西。这是封建统治阶级反对农民革命的一个重要手段。资产阶级也从地主阶级那里继承了这一手。我们和贫下中农中的积极分子讨论“清官”问题的时候，大家指出，这种欺骗宣传活动包括两个方面：一，在不涉及剥削制度和剥削阶级根本利益的事情上，有意做一些“好事”，装出“铁面无私”的样子，拿来给人民群众看。这是在政治斗争中进行欺骗。二，但是，剥削阶级无时无地不在残酷剥削和压迫人民群众，可以用来为自己装样子的“好事”实在太少。他们又特别绞尽脑汁伪造历史、虚构故事进行欺骗宣传。这是在思想斗争中进行欺骗。“清官”是剥削阶级对劳动人民在政治斗争和思想斗争中进行双重欺骗的工具。
    作为政治斗争中的欺骗工具，“清官”是反革命软的一手的具体执行者。这批人最忠实于剥削制度和整个剥削阶级，他们为了剥削制度万世长存，为了自己沽名钓誉，升官发财，进行各种欺骗活动。他们在任期间，有意作一些“好事”，如修桥、铺路，疏通河道，断些无足轻重的案子等。离任的时候，又纠合地方上的绅士、地主搞“万民伞”、“留靴”等鬼把戏。我们在农村听到这样一些故事传说：有人说，有一个“清官”看到一条河道经常淹死人，就发动民工修起了一座桥。有人说，有个县长断案清，他断案的时候，把农民和市民都请来，叫他们站在大堂两侧观看。据说，果真有穷人打赢官司的事。可是，都是些什么案子呢？一个地主的眼镜被卖柴的穷人撞打（破）了，县长没叫穷人赔。我们了解到的几个案子都是类似情形。
    这就是所谓“清官”为百姓办的“好事”。这些传说的可信程度都是极小的。我们就是把这些传说当成实有其事来看，也不难看出“清官”进行欺骗活动的实质。修桥出的是群众的力，花的是群众的钱，换来的是自己的好名声，这完全是拿被剥削者的血汗骗人。拿了一副眼镜之类的案件，当众审理，显示“清官”作风，岂不可笑！更重要的是，“清官”们所做的这一切“好事”，全都有利于巩固剥削阶级的统治，而撞不着剥削阶级、剥削制度的丝毫实际利益。
    作为思想斗争中欺骗工具的“清官”，完全是剥削阶级伪造出来的虚幻形象。封建皇帝看到“清官”在麻痹人民革命意志、巩固封建秩序方面起着特别重要的欺骗作用，对“清官”大肆表彰。特别是在他们死后，赠给他们种种称号，渲染他们的“嘉言美行”。封建统治阶级又特别利用他们垄断文化知识，把持宣传机器的条件，通过他们的文化人，塑造“清官”的虚幻形象，把“清官”说得“清正廉洁”、“明镜高悬”、“执法公平”、“铁面无私”。一整套二十四史，为大大小小的“清官”写史立传，大量的旧小说、旧戏剧齐声为“清官”唱赞歌。上自封建皇帝，下到封建文人，一齐努力，把他们炮制出来的“清官”的虚幻形象灌输到群众头脑里去，其目的就是要被压迫被剥削的群众相信：灾难只是个别贪官污吏造成的，遇到“清官”就会有好日子过。
    这种虚幻的“清官”形象，不仅与真实生活中的贪官污吏根本不同，就是那些所谓“清官”的实际行为，也是比不上的。它是被无限美化、高拔了的，因而它的欺骗作用更广更深。作为双重欺骗工具的“清官”，在思想斗争中的欺骗作用，对统治阶级更为需要，对被压迫被剥削群众的毒害更深。随便问一位年龄大一点的农民，他都可以给你说上好多关于包公的故事及其它一些公案小说和旧戏。正是这些，给农民灌输了毒素，使一些人受到了迷惑。
    说到这里，我们就完全明白了，为什么远离现代的“清官”，往往有人相信；为什么看旧戏、旧小说多的，听旧书多的人，往往相信有“清官”；为什么老年人比青年人相信“清官”的多一些。我们的结论是：群众中存在的对“清官”阶级本质的模糊认识，是剥削阶级在政治斗争和思想斗争中进行欺骗活动造成的。农民中对“清官”有模糊认识，并不能证明“清官”就是“站在农民一边的”。正好相反，它证明了“清官”在维护剥削阶级利益方面起着特殊重要的欺骗作用。
