    To mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of Party members and the people for socialist revolution and socialist construction, it is necessary to fully promote democracy and enable them to dare to put forward opinions and criticisms. First of all, the county party committee leadership team must truly implement democratic centralism, especially the "team leader" must be good at promoting democracy, humbly listen to opinions from all sides, and give full play to everyone's role. In this way, our cause will be invincible.
    Our county party committee leadership team is not united enough, mainly because I, as the "team leader," have not conscientiously implemented the Party's principle of democratic centralism, have not handled the relationship between myself and the committee members seriously according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and have not led this "group of people" well. From studying the deeds of Jiao Yulu, I deeply feel that my understanding of the great significance of implementing democratic centralism is insufficient. I usually talk less with committee members and do not solicit opinions enough. Sometimes, I don't issue "public notices" before meetings, so everyone doesn't understand the topics and is not fully prepared, which often causes the meetings to get entangled in business and administrative issues, and the discussion of major principles and policies is not very serious. Even if we discuss them, because I am not good at listening to different opinions, or because I speak too much and others speak too little, everyone's opinions cannot be fully expressed, and collective wisdom cannot be fully utilized. As a result, the decision is made in form, but not implemented in practice, and the actions are not unified; sometimes, the matter is discussed but not decided, or decided but not acted upon, causing losses to the cause of the Party and the people.
    Whether or not we can fully promote democracy and conscientiously implement the principle of democratic centralism is not just a matter of style, but also a question of whether we have the class feelings of the proletariat and whether we have established a complete and thorough world outlook of serving the people. Like Comrade Jiao Yulu, only by wholeheartedly serving the revolution and wholeheartedly serving the people can we humbly listen to opinions from all sides, especially unpleasant advice. In the future, I am determined to set an example, take the lead in studying Chairman Mao's works well, fully promote democracy, conscientiously carry out criticism and self-criticism, especially humbly listen to criticism from subordinates, and constantly transform my thinking and style, so that the county party committee becomes a strong and thoroughly revolutionary leadership core.

    善于倾听逆耳之言
    要调动广大党员和群众社会主义革命和社会主义建设的积极性，必须充分发扬民主，使他们敢于提出意见和批评。这首先要县委领导班子真正执行民主集中制，特别是当班长的要善于发扬民主，虚心听取各方面的意见，充分发挥大家的作用。这样，我们的事业将无往而不胜。
    我们县委领导班子还不够齐心一致，主要是我这个当班长的没有认真贯彻执行党的民主集中制的原则，没有按照毛主席的指示，认真处理好自己和委员之间的关系，没有把这“一班人”带好。从学习焦裕禄的事迹中，我深深感到：我对实行民主集中制的重大意义认识不足，平时与委员谈心少，征求意见不够。有时开会前又不出“安民告示”，大家不了解议题，没有充分准备，往往使会议纠缠在业务性、事务性的问题中，对重大方针政策问题讨论很不认真。即使讨论了，也因我不善于倾听不同的意见，或因自己讲的多，别人讲的少，使大家的意见不能充分说出来，集体智慧不能充分发挥。结果，形式上决定了，实际执行不通，行动不齐；有时甚至议而不决，决而不行，使党和人民的事业受到损失。
    能不能充分发扬民主、认真实行民主集中制的原则，不只是一个作风问题，而且是有没有无产阶级的阶级感情、有没有树立完全、彻底地为人民服务的世界观的问题。象焦裕禄同志那样，一心为革命，一心为人民，才能虚心倾听各方面的意见，特别是逆耳之言。今后，我决心以身作则，带头学好毛主席著作，充分发扬民主，认真开展批评与自我批评，特别是虚心倾听来自下级的批评，不断改造思想和作风，使县委成为一个坚强的、彻底革命化的领导核心。
