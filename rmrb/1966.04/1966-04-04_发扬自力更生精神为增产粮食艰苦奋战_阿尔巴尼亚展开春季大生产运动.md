    Tirana, April 2 (Xinhua) – Under the call and leadership of the Albanian Labor Party, a spring production campaign centered on grain production is vigorously unfolding in the Albanian countryside.

    This year is the first year of Albania's Fourth Five-Year Plan. After discussing the Central Committee of the Party and the Council of Ministers' call for discussion and formulation of the Fourth Five-Year Plan and the Party Central Committee's open letter in March this year, the vast number of agricultural workers in Albania have seen unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm and labor activism. Leading cadres in various regions have also responded to the call of the Party Central Committee, going deep into the front lines of agriculture to lead production. Therefore, this year's spring sowing is progressing relatively quickly. As of the end of March, the sown area nationwide has increased compared to the same period last year.

    The biggest characteristic of this year's spring agricultural production in Albania is that the vast rural areas across the country are working hard to achieve self-reliance and strive for increased grain production. It is expected that the national grain output this year will increase by a quarter compared to last year. Many regions have put forward the slogan "Use the best and most suitable land for growing grain." The "Kutalli" cooperative in the Berat District has moved some cash crops to the mountains and used 300 hectares (one hectare equals fifteen mu) of good land to grow grain. Currently, wheat seedlings are growing well in various parts of Albania, and cooperative members are loosening the soil, applying fertilizer, and watering to strengthen field management.

    In order to increase grain and other agricultural products, rural areas across the country have changed the past habit of not using human and animal manure and are vigorously carrying out a manure accumulation campaign. In the first three months of this year, the amount of fertilizer accumulated in most regions, such as Lushnjë, Mirditë, and Mat, has doubled compared to the same period last year. The amount of fertilizer accumulated in the Berat District is equivalent to three times that of the same period last year.

    In order to increase grain and other agricultural products, rural areas have also taken measures such as deep plowing and water conservancy projects. By the end of February, more than 68,000 hectares of land nationwide had been deep-plowed. Another feature of Albania's spring agricultural production this year is the large-scale planting of potatoes. It is planned to plant more than 12,000 hectares of potatoes this year, more than three times as much as last year. As of the end of March, the area planted had exceeded the area planted throughout last year by more than 25 percent.

    In order to increase agricultural production, in addition to increasing the yield per unit area, rural areas are also actively reclaiming wasteland and transforming swamps to expand the cultivated area. Since last winter and this spring, 8,500 hectares of wasteland have been reclaimed nationwide. Agricultural workers in mountainous and hilly areas have learned from the experience of Dazhai in China and built many terraced fields. Some cooperatives are called "Albanian Dazhai."

### 发扬自力更生精神为增产粮食艰苦奋战  阿尔巴尼亚展开春季大生产运动

    发扬自力更生精神为增产粮食艰苦奋战
    阿尔巴尼亚展开春季大生产运动
    新华社地拉那二日电　在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的号召和领导下，一个以粮食生产为中心的春季大生产运动，正在阿尔巴尼亚全国农村蓬勃展开。
    今年是阿尔巴尼亚第四个五年计划的第一年。阿尔巴尼亚广大农业劳动者在讨论了党中央和部长会议关于讨论和制订第四个五年计划的号召书和今年三月党中央的公开信以后，革命热情和劳动积极性空前高涨。各地区的领导干部也纷纷响应党中央的号召，深入农业第一线，领导生产。因此，今年春播进行得较快。到三月下旬为止，全国已播种面积比去年同期有了增加。
    今年阿尔巴尼亚春季农业生产的最大的特点是：全国广大农村都在为自力更生，争取粮食增产而艰苦奋战。预计今年全国的粮食产量要比去年增长四分之一。许多地区提出“把最好的、最合适的地用来种粮食”的口号。培拉特区的“库塔里”合作社把一部分经济作物种到山上去，用三百公顷（一公顷合十五市亩）好地种粮食。现在，阿尔巴尼亚各地的麦苗长得很好，社员们正在给麦田松土、追肥浇尿，加强田间管理。
    为了增产粮食和其他农产品，目前，各地农村改变了过去不施人的粪尿的习惯，大搞积肥运动。今年头三个月，卢什涅、米尔迪塔和马蒂等绝大部分区的积肥数量比去年同期增加了一倍。培拉特区的积肥量相当于去年同期的三倍。
    为了增产粮食和其他农产品，各地农村还采取了深耕土地和兴修水利等措施。到二月底为止，全国已深耕土地六万八千多公顷。今年，阿尔巴尼亚春季农业生产的另一特点是，大种马铃薯。今年计划种植马铃薯一万二千多公顷，比去年增加三倍多。到三月底为止，已栽植的面积比去年全年种植的面积还要超过百分之二十五。
    为了增加农业生产，除了提高单位面积的产量以外，各地农村还积极开荒、改造沼泽地，扩大耕种面积。去冬今春以来，全国已开垦八千五百公顷荒地。高山区和丘陵地区的农业劳动者学习了中国大寨的经验，修筑了许多梯田。有些合作社被称为“阿尔巴尼亚的大寨”。
