    Grasp Mao Zedong Thought to Distinguish Right from Wrong
    Worker of Anshan Steel Window Factory, Chu Gequan
    Many comrades have correctly criticized Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" as two big poisonous weeds that are anti-Party and anti-socialist. No matter what tricks the right-leaning opportunists play, they will eventually reveal their true colors. Because we have grasped a true truth that can distinguish right from wrong, that is, the great Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao taught us that class struggle will not end in socialist society. Comrade Wu Han's works are precisely a reflection of class struggle.
    Comrade Wu Han took advantage of the temporary difficulties caused by the three years of natural disasters in our country, as well as the opportunity of modern revisionism cutting us off, to scold our great Party by using the corpse of "Hai Rui". He thought that he could confuse us workers in this way, but this is impossible. We will never allow right-leaning opportunists to slander our Party or insult our proletariat. All monsters and demons, no matter what form they appear in, no matter how stubbornly they resist our great Party, they will eventually be disgracefully defeated like an egg hitting a rock.
    In his "self-criticism", Comrade Wu Han also adopted the method of deception, attempting to avoid the substantive key issues and writing at length about some insignificant things. We must thoroughly expose his trick.

    掌握毛泽东思想明辨是非
    鞍山市钢窗厂工人　褚阁泉
    许多同志批判吴晗写的《海瑞骂皇帝》和《海瑞罢官》是反党反社会主义的两株大毒草，这是完全正确的。尽管右倾机会主义者耍出各种各样花招，他们终究会原形毕露。因为我们掌握了一个真正能够辨明是非的真理，那就是伟大的毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们，在社会主义社会里，阶级斗争不会完结。吴晗同志的作品，正是阶级斗争的反映。
    吴晗同志利用我国三年自然灾害所造成的暂时困难，以及现代修正主义卡我们的时机，借“海瑞”这具僵尸来骂我们伟大的党。他以为这样就可以迷惑我们工人了，但是这是办不到的。我们决不允许右倾机会主义者来诽谤我们的党，来侮辱我们无产阶级。一切牛鬼蛇神，无论他们在什么形势下出现，无论他们怎样顽固地和我们伟大的党相对抗，他们终久会象鸡蛋碰巨石一样，遭到可耻的失败。
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”里，还采取了蒙混的手法，企图避开实质性的关键问题，大写特写一些无足轻重的东西。我们要彻底戳穿他的这种手法。
