    No Corruption of the Next Generation Allowed
    Ni Guyin, Counselor of the First Normal School Affiliated Primary School of Shanghai

    I am a teacher and a counselor of the Young Pioneers. I am particularly angry about Comrade Wu Han's beautification of emperors, generals, and ministers, and his vilification of the laboring people.

    The struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the younger generation is an extremely important component of the entire class struggle during the transition period. The proletariat must use its own world outlook to educate and cultivate a new generation, while the bourgeoisie also uses its own world outlook to corrupt and compete for the next generation.

    Children are most susceptible to infection and poisoning by ideological toxins. They are young and have poor discernment. Whenever they go to see a new play, whenever they are told a story or read a book, they always ask first, is this a good person? Or a bad person? In his works such as "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," and "The Story of Hai Rui," Comrade Wu Han deliberately emphasized "how Hai Rui did good things for the people" and "how he was loved by the people," saying that he "cared for the people and thought of everything for the common people." He not only praised Hai Rui, but also praised a series of people such as Kuang Zhong, Zhou Chen, and Yu Qian, and deliberately sang their praises. Comrade Wu Han also particularly pointed out that "good people" do not need criticism. Therefore, these people—Hai Rui, Kuang Zhong, etc.—are all good people from the moment they appear in the story or on the stage to the moment they leave, and they are "great good people" without shortcomings. This makes it impossible for children to have a correct standard of right and wrong from an early age. It seems that in the evil feudal ruling class group, there are really some "incorruptible officials" and "good people" who serve the people wholeheartedly.

    Comrade Wu Han's propaganda sings a counter-tune to our class education. When we educate children to understand that all exploiting classes and ruling classes are enemies of the laboring people, and that all crows under the sun are equally black, some children influenced by Comrade Wu Han say that "officials" are not all bad, "incorruptible officials are good," "didn't Hai Rui and Bao Gong do many good things for the people?" I remember that after the Tenth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee in 1962, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, we strengthened class education for children. Through educational activities such as visiting the "Four Olds," recalling bitterness and thinking about sweetness, and comparing childhood with fathers, the children became clearer about what is exploitation and what is oppression, and the concept that all exploiting classes are enemies of the laboring people gradually took root. However, when children read stories praising these "good people," they develop some confused ideas again, and we have to educate them again. The reason is very clear: without thoroughly criticizing Comrade Wu Han's erroneous views, the ghost of the "incorruptible official" will not dissipate, and it will always hinder the next generation from establishing a correct class viewpoint.

    Comrade Wu Han has studied history for many years, but he does not study the laws of historical development, nor does he study how the laboring people created history and promoted historical progress. Instead of using history to educate the next generation to inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of the Chinese laboring people, he elevates so many emperors, generals, and ministers, and feudal scholar-officials, and asks young people to learn from them.

    The revolutionary cause requires us to accelerate the training of the next generation so that they all become proletarian revolutionary successors with a clear class stand and class feelings. Comrade Wu Han has elevated so many feudal scholar-officials and emphasized learning from them. Why is Comrade Wu Han so fond of these ancient people? At first glance, it seems that Comrade Wu Han is a historian, and he has special research on these people. A careful analysis reveals that Comrade Wu Han's real purpose is to support a small handful of right-leaning opportunists in opposing the Party and socialism. At the same time, Comrade Wu Han frantically propagandizes for the ancients and vociferously calls on young people to learn from the ancients. This is to instill feudalist and capitalist toxins into the younger generation, to cooperate with the imperialist and revisionist plots of peaceful evolution, to spread the idea of class reconciliation, to blur the class boundaries of young people, and to resist Mao Zedong Thought. Isn't this precisely a frenzied attack by the three forces of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism on the revolutionary descendants? Isn't this a very obvious struggle with the proletariat for revolutionary descendants, fundamentally undermining the foundations of socialism! I am alertly aware that this is a sharp and complex class struggle of life and death. As a worker for children and young people, I must resolutely plunge into this battle, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, to defend the healthy growth of revolutionary descendants, resolutely arm my mind and arm the children according to Chairman Mao's teachings, and we must pass on Mao Zedong Thought from generation to generation, and we must train the children into proletarian revolutionary successors.

    不许腐蚀下一代
    上海市第一师范附小辅导员　倪谷音
    我是教师，是少先队辅导员，对吴晗同志美化帝王将相、丑化劳动人民特别感到气愤。
    无产阶级与资产阶级争夺青少年一代，是过渡时期整个阶级斗争中一个极其重要的组成部分。无产阶级要用自己的世界观教育造就一代新人，资产阶级也要以自己的世界观腐蚀、争夺下一代。
    孩子们是最易受意识形态里的毒素所感染和毒害的。他们幼小，识别力较差，每逢带孩子们去看一场新戏、每逢给孩子们讲一个故事或看一本书，他们首先总是问这是好人？还是坏人？吴晗同志在他写的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》、《海瑞的故事》等作品里都着意渲染“海瑞如何为人民办了好事”“如何受人民的爱戴”，说他“爱护人民，一切为老百姓着想”。他不仅捧出了海瑞，还一系列地捧出了况钟、周忱、于谦等许多人，着意地进行歌颂。吴晗同志又特别提出对于“好人”就不需要批判。因此这些人——海瑞、况钟等，一出现在故事中或舞台上，从上场到下场，自始至终都是好人，而且是没有缺点的“大好人”。这就使孩子们从小看问题就没有一个正确的是非标准，似乎在万恶的封建统治阶级集团里，还真有那么一些一切为老百姓服务的“清官”、“好人”。
    吴晗同志的宣传，与我们进行阶级教育唱对台戏。当我们教育儿童懂得一切剥削阶级、统治阶级都是劳动人民的敌人、天下乌鸦一般黑的真理的时候，就有受吴晗同志影响的孩子说“官”不都是坏的，“清官是好的”，“海瑞包公不是为人民做过许多好事吗？”我记得一九六二年八届十中全会以后，我们按照毛主席的指示，加强对孩子进行阶级教育，通过访问四老、忆苦思甜、与爸爸比童年等教育活动，孩子们对什么叫剥削、什么叫压迫比较清楚了，对一切剥削阶级都是劳动人民的敌人这个观念也逐渐树立起来了。但是孩子们一看赞扬这些“好人”的故事，又会产生一些糊涂的观念，我们又得进行教育。道理十分清楚，不彻底批判吴晗同志的这些错误观点，“清官”的阴魂就是不散，总是阻碍着下一代树立起正确的阶级观点。
    吴晗同志研究了多年的历史，不研究历史发展的规律，不研究劳动人民怎样创造了历史，怎样推动了历史前进。不是用历史来教育下一代继承和发扬中国劳动人民的优良传统，却抬出那么多的帝王将相，封建士大夫，要青少年向他们学习。
    革命事业需要我们加速培养后一代都成为具有鲜明的阶级立场、阶级感情的无产阶级革命接班人。吴晗同志抬出这许多封建士大夫来，而且那么强调向他们学习。为什么吴晗同志对这些古人那么爱不释手呢？乍一看，好象因为吴晗同志是历史学家，对这些人特别有研究。仔细一分析，就不难发现吴晗同志的真正目的是支持一小撮右倾机会主义分子反党反社会主义。同时，吴晗同志那么狂热地为古人宣传，声嘶力竭地号召青少年向古人学习。这是要向青少年一代灌输封建主义资本主义的毒素，配合帝国主义、修正主义和平演变的阴谋，散布阶级调和的思想，模糊青少年的阶级界线，抵制毛泽东思想。这不正是代表资产阶级、封建主义、修正主义这三股势力向革命后代猖狂进攻吗？这不是十分明显地与无产阶级争夺革命后代，从根本上挖社会主义的墙脚吗！我警惕地感到这是一场你死我活的尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。我作为一个少年儿童工作者，一定要坚决投入这场战斗，为捍卫毛泽东思想，为捍卫革命后代健康成长，坚决按毛主席的教导武装自己的头脑，也武装孩子们，一定要使毛泽东思想世世代代传下去，一定要把孩子们都培养成无产阶级的革命接班人。
