    Sentry Duty (Clapper Talk)
    Chen Simin, Militia of Luozhou Brigade, Nantong Commune, Fujian

    The night is deep, people are quiet, the moon is high,
    A vast mist shrouds the fields;
    Stepping lightly out of the village,
    I follow the squad leader on patrol.
    The squad leader gives a command,
    We both lie down at the same time:
    I ask the squad leader what's wrong?
    The squad leader just shakes his hand.
    There's a shadow behind the big tree,
    It's the militia on sentry duty,
    Taking a closer look, who is on duty?
    It’s Squad Leader's wife, Sister-in-law Guihua.
    I laugh inwardly, without saying a word,
    The squad leader's eyesight isn't as good as mine,
    Clearly it's one of our own,
    How could he see her as a target.
    I look forward again,
    Huh!?
    Why can't I find the shadow?
    I report to the squad leader,
    The squad leader says:
    "Our target is exposed!"
    Before the person arrives, the voice comes first:
    "Who is it?"
    The accent is loud and the tone is high.
    "Friend!"
    I quickly answer and give my name.
    "Reply!"
    "Mountain Eagle!"
    "Reply!"
    "Night Cat!"
    Oh! It turns out to really be Sister-in-law Guihua.
    Sister-in-law Guihua comes over and complains:
    "Why are you
    fooling around with me?"
    The squad leader quickly replies:
    "We came to test you."
    "Humph!
    If you can't answer the password, I won't be polite!"
    "Humph!
    If you're negligent, you'll have to write a self-criticism!"
    After saying these serious words,
    Everyone couldn't help but laugh.
    Finally, everyone expresses their attitude:
    "With our pair of night cat eyes,
    Not a single enemy will escape!"

    廵哨（快板）
    福建南通公社罗洲大队民兵　陈思民
    更深人静月正高，
    田野茫茫夜雾罩；
    转出村头轻步走，
    我跟班长去巡哨。
    班长一声口令传，
    我俩同时来卧倒：
    我问班长为啥事？
    班长只把手来摇。
    大树后面有人影，
    那是民兵在放哨，
    细看值勤是谁人？
    班长的爱人桂花嫂。
    我嘴里不说心里笑，
    班长的眼力没我高，
    明明是个自己人，
    怎么看成是目标。
    我再把眼睛向前瞧，
    咦！？
    怎么人影没处找。
    我向班长作报告，
    班长说：
    “我们的目标暴露了！”
    不见来人声先到：
    “什么人？”
    口音宏亮音调高。
    “自己人！”
    我赶紧回答把名报。
    “回令！”
    “山鹰！”
    “回令！”
    “夜猫！”
    哎呀！原来真是桂花嫂。
    桂花嫂过来埋怨道：
    “你们呀，
    为啥跟我来胡闹？”
    班长连忙作回答：
    “我们来把你考一考。”
    “哼！
    要答不上口令不客气！”
    “哼！
    要是麻痹叫你作检讨！”
    说了一席正经话，
    不禁各人都发笑。
    最后大家表态度：
    “有我们这一双夜猫眼，
    敌人一个跑不掉！”
