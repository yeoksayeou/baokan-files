    Is it inevitable to "drop sesame seeds" when "eating sesame cakes"?
    Worker Wang Baoli, Fengtai Locomotive Depot, Beijing Railway Bureau
    A vertical lathe often leaked oil, and Master Guo, a mechanic, tried several methods without success. Someone advised him, "Forget it, just let it leak a little! How can you 'eat sesame cakes' without 'dropping sesame seeds'!" But Master Guo did not see it that way. He thought, "Even a little bit of oil is state property, and state property should be cherished!" He was determined: he would not give up until the oil leak was solved. To find out where the oil was leaking, he crawled into the ditch to observe and ponder, and when the power was off, he disassembled the relevant parts for analysis and research, finally solving this long-standing difficult problem.
    "How can you 'eat sesame cakes' without 'dropping sesame seeds'!" This kind of thinking is somewhat representative. In the eyes of some people, a little waste in production and a few defective products are inevitable. Is it really inevitable to "drop sesame seeds" when "eating sesame cakes"? Not necessarily. It depends on your attitude and method of "eating sesame cakes". If you are careful and cautious, and your "eating" method is correct, then the "sesame seeds" may not "drop". Aren't there many models of thrift who have been thrifty for more than ten years? Aren't there many advanced producers who have not produced any defective products for a long time? They "eat sesame cakes" every day, but they have never "dropped" a single "sesame seed", and that's because they are serious and have the right methods. If you are careless and don't care, and your "eating" method is not right, then of course you will inevitably "drop sesame seeds". Master Guo's experience in solving oil leaks proves that even if it was originally "dropping sesame seeds", as long as you value it in your mind and your "eating" method is correct, you can still turn "dropping sesame seeds" into not "dropping sesame seeds".
   "Waste is at the scene, but the key is in the mind." Whether or not you "drop sesame seeds" when "eating sesame cakes" ultimately depends on whether the person "eating sesame cakes" has the thought of "who knows that every grain on your plate is the result of hard work". With this kind of thinking, you will be serious and try every means not to "drop sesame seeds".

### “吃烧饼”非“掉芝麻”不可吗？

    “吃烧饼”非“掉芝麻”不可吗？
    北京铁路局丰台机务段工人　王保丽
    一部立式旋床经常发生漏油，机修工郭师傅想了几种办法都没有解决。有人劝他说：“算了，漏点就漏点吧！‘吃烧饼’哪有不‘掉芝麻’的！”但郭师傅并不这样看问题，他想：“即使是一点油也是国家的财产，是国家财产就应该珍惜！”他下定决心：不解决漏油问题决不罢休。为搞清漏油处所，他钻进地沟进行实地观察、琢磨，并在停电时将有关部件解体进行分析、研究，终于解决了这个老大难的问题。
    “‘吃烧饼’哪有不‘掉芝麻’的！”这种思想有一定的代表性。在有些人看来，生产中浪费一点，出一点废品，都是不可避免的。“吃烧饼”真是非“掉芝麻”不可吗？不一定。这要看你“吃烧饼”的态度和方法如何。小心谨慎，“吃”法对头，“芝麻”就不一定“掉”。不是有许多十几年如一日的节约模范吗？不是有不少长期不出废品的先进生产者吗？他们天天在“吃烧饼”，却没有“掉”过一粒“芝麻”，这就是因为他们态度认真，方法对头。如果是大大咧咧，满不在乎，“吃”的方法又不对头，当然就非“掉芝麻”不可了。郭师傅解决漏油的经验证明：即使原来是“掉芝麻”的，只要思想重视，“吃”法对头，也还可以使“掉芝麻”变成不“掉芝麻”。
   “浪费在现场，关键在思想。”“吃烧饼”是不是“掉芝麻”，归根到底，又在于“吃烧饼”的人有没有“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”的思想。有了这种思想，就会态度认真，并千方百计地不“掉芝麻”了。
