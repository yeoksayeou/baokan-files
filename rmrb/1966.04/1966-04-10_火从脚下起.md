    Fire Starts from Below
    By a commentator of this newspaper

    A mass struggle storm against the U.S.-puppet clique has recently swept across the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam. The Nguyễn Cao Kỳ mini-court is teetering, the U.S. occupation army is in a sorry state, and the Johnson administration is panic-stricken. This once again proves that the rule of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam is very weak and is accelerating towards collapse.

    The enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam, especially cities like Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue, are where the U.S.-puppet clique stations its heavy troops and are the main strongholds of U.S. imperialism’s aggression against South Vietnam. In this area, there are more than 200,000 U.S. troops and a huge naval and air force. U.S. imperialism thought that in this way, the people in the enemy-occupied areas would not dare to move. However, the situation is not like this at all. On the contrary, once the fire of the people's struggle in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam is ignited, the U.S. consulate will be surrounded, Americans will be beaten, American soldiers will not dare to go out on the streets, and American puppets will be in chaos. Washington is even more at a loss, not knowing what troubles will arise tomorrow. Who is afraid of whom? It is not the seemingly weak masses of people who fear the U.S.-puppet clique armed to the teeth, but the American aggressors sitting on a huge war machine who are trembling in fear of the surging tide of the people's struggle.

    Fire starts from below. The more U.S. imperialism expands the war of aggression against Vietnam and sends troops to occupy South Vietnam on a large scale, the deeper the national hatred of the South Vietnamese people towards U.S. imperialism becomes. Similarly, the more the South Vietnamese puppet clique intensifies its betrayal of national interests and the more intense their infighting becomes, the greater the anger of the South Vietnamese people becomes. Any spark can ignite a raging fire. The new wave of struggle by the people in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam against the U.S.-puppet clique that recently erupted is the result of this situation.

    It should be seen that the sharpening of internal contradictions within the South Vietnamese puppet clique further increases the crisis of the U.S.-puppet rule. In mid-March, Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, relying on the support of his American masters, arrogantly drove his political enemy, Nguyễn Chánh Thi, the puppet commander of the First Corps, from office. Nguyễn Chánh Thi and his followers have real power in their hands and are unwilling to be excluded. The infighting among the factions of the puppet clique has turned into open strife. Nguyễn Chánh Thi and his gang, relying on the military power they held in Da Nang and Hue, mobilized military police to create disturbances on the streets, creating a tense situation and forcing Nguyễn Cao Kỳ to concede. This infighting within the enemy camp has intensified the anger that has long been accumulated by the South Vietnamese people, and the anti-U.S.-puppet struggle wave has become unstoppable.

    The intensification of infighting within the puppet clique has created a problem for U.S. imperialism. The Nguyễn Cao Kỳ puppet regime is a loyal lackey of the United States. At the Honolulu Conference not long ago, Johnson had praised this clown and his "government" to the skies, calling them the "heroic leaders" of "common progress," in short, portraying this puppet regime as a "stable" "government" supported by the South Vietnamese people. However, now the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ regime cannot even survive in the U.S.-puppet occupied areas maintained by American bayonets. The masses of people are attacking it, and internal conflicts are erupting within the puppet clique, making it totter. If the American masters do not vigorously protect it, this Nguyễn Cao Kỳ puppet regime may fall under all kinds of attacks; if they openly come forward to support it, they are afraid of arousing greater dissatisfaction and resistance, which would not only be detrimental to the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ puppet, but also put themselves in a bad light. It is no wonder that the Johnson administration feels at a loss.

    However, no matter how Johnson’s government pretends to be calm, it cannot hide the worries and panic in its heart. As the American bourgeois newspapers revealed, the American ruling authorities are worried that the overthrow of the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ regime would "greatly disrupt" the steps of the United States to expand the war in South Vietnam and the so-called "pacification plan," and would make people more convinced that "the United States is an aggressor in South Vietnam." Therefore, the United States cannot stand idly by. In fact, it is conducting covert and cunning intervention, trying its best to help the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ puppet clique stabilize its position. The Johnson government desperately propagandizes that the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ regime is not an American puppet and that the United States does not intend to interfere in South Vietnam’s internal affairs; on the other hand, it actively instigates and helps the Nguyễn Cao Kỳ regime to suppress and quell the movements against it. However, the tricks played by the American aggressors cannot save the political crisis of the South Vietnamese puppet clique. No matter what the outcome of this round is, the days of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam are getting worse and worse.

    At present, there are two battlefronts in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces are attacking the American aggressors and puppet troops everywhere, which is one battlefront. The anti-U.S. political struggle of the people in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam is another battlefront. These two battlefronts are mutually coordinated and echoing each other. The victory of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces on the battlefield of resisting America and saving the country has given great encouragement to the struggle of the people in the enemy-occupied areas. Similarly, the anti-U.S. struggle of the people in the enemy-occupied areas is also a support for the struggle of the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces. The development of these two battlefronts is a sign of the excellent situation in the South Vietnamese people's liberation struggle. It can be asserted that no matter what tricks U.S. imperialism plays or what struggles it makes, it cannot save its shameful fate of final defeat in South Vietnam.

    火从脚下起
    本报评论员
    一个反对美伪集团的群众性斗争风暴，最近席卷了越南南方的敌占区。阮高其小朝廷摇摇欲坠，美国占领军狼狈万状，约翰逊政府惊慌失色。这就再一次证明：美帝国主义及其走狗在南越的统治，是十分虚弱的，并且正在加速走向土崩瓦解。
    南越的敌占区，特别象西贡、岘港、顺化等这些城市，是美伪集团重兵驻守之地，是美帝国主义侵略南越的主要据点。在这个地区里，摆着美国的二十多万大兵，庞大的海空军力量。美帝国主义以为这样一来，敌占区人民就不敢动弹了。但是，局面完全不是这个样子。相反地，南越敌占区人民斗争的怒火一旦燃起，美国领事馆就被包围，美国人就要挨揍，美国兵就不敢上街，美国傀儡就乱成一团。华盛顿更是手足失措，不知道明天还要出什么乱子。谁怕谁？不是看来弱小的人民群众怕武装到牙齿的美伪集团，而是坐在庞大战争机器上的美国侵略者，被风起云涌的人民斗争浪潮吓得发抖。
    火从脚下起。美帝国主义越是扩大侵越战争，越是大举派兵占领南越，南越人民对美帝国主义的民族仇恨就越深。同样地，南越傀儡集团越是变本加厉地出卖民族利益，它们的内讧越是剧烈，南越人民的愤怒就越大。任何一颗火星，都可以点燃起熊熊烈火。最近南越敌占区人民反对美伪集团斗争的新浪潮，就是在这种形势下迸发出来的。
    应该看到，南越傀儡集团内部矛盾的尖锐化，更增加了美伪统治的危机。三月中旬，阮高其仗着美国主子的支撑，趾高气扬，把他的政敌、伪第一军军长阮正诗赶下了台。阮正诗及其党羽手中握有实力，决不甘心自己被排斥。傀儡集团各派系之间的暗斗，变成了明争。阮正诗一伙人依靠在岘港、顺化掌有的兵权，动员军警，上街起哄，剑拔弩张，逼迫阮高其让步。敌人营垒中的这种倾轧，使南越人民长期积累起来的怒火更加炽烈起来，反美伪的斗争浪潮，一发不可收拾。
    傀儡集团内讧的白热化，给美帝国主义出了难题。阮高其傀儡政权是美国忠心耿耿的走狗。在不久以前的檀香山会议上，约翰逊曾经把这个小丑和他的“政府”捧上了天，称他们是什么“共同前进”的“英勇的领导人”，总之，把这个傀儡政权说成是得到南越人民支持的、可以“稳定”的“政府”。但是，现在阮高其政权甚至在靠了美国刺刀维持的美伪占领区中都混不下去，人民群众鸣鼓而攻，傀儡集团内部发生公开冲突，使它摇摇欲坠。美国主子如果不大力保驾，这个阮高其傀儡政权在各方面攻击下，很可能要滚下台来；如果公开出面予以支持，又怕激起更大的不满和反抗，不仅对阮高其傀儡不利，而且会使自己吃霉头。这就难怪约翰逊政府感到不知如何是好了。
    但是，不管约翰逊政府怎样假装镇静，也掩不住它心里的忧虑和惊慌。正如美国资产阶级报刊所透露的，美国统治当局担心阮高其政权被推翻，会“大大打乱”美国在南越扩大战争的步骤和所谓“绥靖计划”，而且会使人更加认定“美国是南越的侵略者”。因此，美国是不能够袖手旁观的。事实上它正在进行着隐蔽而狡猾的干预，竭力帮阮高其傀儡集团稳住阵脚。约翰逊政府一方面拼命宣传阮高其政权不是美国傀儡，美国不准备干涉南越内部的事情；另一方面则积极教唆和帮助阮高其政权去镇压和平息反对它的运动。但是，美国侵略者玩弄的这种手段，是挽救不了南越傀儡集团的政治危机的。不管这一回合结果如何，美帝国主义及其走狗在南越的日子是越来越不好过了。
    目前，在越南南方境内，有两条战线。南越人民武装到处打击美国侵略者和伪军，这是一条战线。南越敌占区人民的反美政治斗争，这是又一条战线。这两条战线，是互相配合、互为呼应的。南越人民武装在抗美救国战场上的胜利，给予了敌占区人民斗争以极大的鼓舞。同样地，敌占区人民的反美斗争，也是对南越人民武装斗争的支持。这两条战线的发展，是南越人民解放斗争形势大好的标志。可以断言，不管美帝国主义再玩什么花样，再作什么挣扎，都无法挽回它在南越最后失败的可耻命运。
