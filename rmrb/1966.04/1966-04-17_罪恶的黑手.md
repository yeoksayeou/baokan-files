　　After the fascist atrocities of the Indonesian armed forces, colluding with thugs, in attacking the Chinese Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Malik pretentiously arrived at the scene of the embassy, as if this bloody crime had nothing to do with the Indonesian government; Malik was merely a "bystander."

　　However, a sinister black hand, even if it wears white gloves, is still a black hand. The Indonesian government, controlled by the right-wing generals' clique, is the direct organizer and leader of this fascist atrocity. Look, the thugs shouted slogans like "Uncle Suharto told us to smash the Chinese Embassy" during the violence. The Indonesian government dispatched army armed personnel and armored vehicles to coordinate with the thugs' actions. Not only that, on the morning of April 15, an anti-China rally was also held in Jakarta's Banteng Square. It was this Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Malik who delivered a written speech at the rally, blatantly inciting anti-China and anti-Chinese hysteria. Malik spoke extensively at the meeting about how the Indonesian right-wing military regime would adopt a "clear attitude and resolute measures." It is very clear that Malik, in his capacity as Indonesian Deputy Prime Minister, openly issued the order to attack the Chinese Embassy. Immediately after this anti-China rally, the thugs who attended were sent to the Chinese Embassy, staging this full-fledged fascist farce. With ironclad evidence, what reason does the likes of Malik have to deny it?

　　It must also be pointed out that some of the thugs who attacked the Chinese Embassy were Kuomintang special agents. This group of Kuomintang special agents also participated in the rallies mobilized by the Indonesian authorities to oppose China. Not long ago, Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces led them to the Chinese diplomatic and consular missions in Indonesia to make trouble. It can be seen that the Indonesian authorities today have colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, which has long been spurned by the Chinese people, deliberately and thoroughly breaking off diplomatic relations between China and Indonesia. Isn't this also crystal clear?

　　A government that claims to be the government of a country has committed such bandit-like acts of arson, violence, robbery, and destruction against the embassy of another sovereign country. This is appalling. The Indonesian authorities must bear full responsibility for thoroughly destroying the relations between China and Indonesia!

    罪恶的黑手
    在印度尼西亚武装部队伙同暴徒袭击中国驻雅加达使馆的法西斯暴行发生之后，印度尼西亚的内阁副总理兼外交部长马利克装模作样地来到使馆现场，仿佛这一次血腥罪行，同印度尼西亚政府无关；马利克不过是一个“旁观者”而已。
    但是，罪恶的黑手，即使戴上了白手套，仍然是双黑手。在右派将领集团控制下的印度尼西亚政府，是这次法西斯暴行的直接组织者和领导者。请看，暴徒们在行凶中狂叫“苏哈托伯伯叫我们捣毁中国大使馆”的口号。印度尼西亚政府出动陆军武装人员和装甲车配合暴徒们行动。不仅如此，四月十五日上午，在雅加达雄牛广场还曾举行反华集会。正是这个副总理兼外交部长马利克，在集会上发表了书面讲话，明目张胆地煽动反华和排华歇斯底里。马利克在会上大讲印度尼西亚右派军人政权要采取“明确的态度和坚决的措施”。十分明显，马利克是以印度尼西亚副总理的身份，公开地发出袭击中国大使馆的号令。就在这个反华集会之后，与会的暴徒们便被送往中国大使馆，演出了这场全武行的法西斯丑剧。铁证如山，马利克之流还有什么理由可以进行抵赖呢？
    还必须指出，这次袭击中国大使馆的暴徒中，有一些是蒋帮特务分子。这一批蒋帮特务分子也参加了印度尼西亚当局动员反华的集会。不久以前，印度尼西亚右派反动势力就曾把他们带领到中国驻印度尼西亚的外交和领事机构进行捣乱。可见，今天的印度尼西亚当局，已经同被中国人民所早已唾弃了的蒋介石匪帮，勾结在一起，蓄意彻底破裂中国和印度尼西亚的外交关系。这不也是一清二楚的吗？
    自称是一个国家的政府，竟对另一主权国家的使馆干出这种放火行凶，抢劫破坏的匪徒的行径，这是骇人听闻的。印度尼西亚当局必须对彻底破坏中国和印度尼西亚两国关系，承担全部罪责！
