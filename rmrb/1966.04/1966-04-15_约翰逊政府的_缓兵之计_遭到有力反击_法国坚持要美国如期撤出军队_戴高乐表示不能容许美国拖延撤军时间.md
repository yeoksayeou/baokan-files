    (Xinhua News Agency, April 13th) A new confrontation is unfolding between the United States and France regarding the timing and conditions of the withdrawal of U.S. troops and bases from French territory.

    On April 12th, the United States delivered a note to the French government, employing delaying tactics regarding France's demand that U.S. troops and bases withdraw from French territory within a year. At the same time, it raised issues of financial compensation and cessation of the supply of nuclear warheads to French troops stationed in West Germany, engaging in blatant threats and blackmail against France.

    On the same day, the U.S. State Department released an interview with Secretary of State Rusk by a journalist from the French magazine "Paris Match." In the interview, he attacked France's decision to withdraw from the military integration of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization without consulting its allies, calling it a "fundamental undermining of the solemnity of international agreements."

    The U.S. note was a response to France's memorandum of March 29th, which laid out a timetable for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and bases. The note indicates that the United States wants to remain in France for longer, using the excuse of the "security of the entire alliance." It stated that U.S. troops were stationed in France under bilateral U.S.-French agreements, and that canceling the agreements required mutual consent from both governments. The U.S. government "cannot agree" to the deadline of April 1, 1967, "believing that such hasty action would damage the security interests of all members of the alliance."

    The note further requested that a year be designated as a period for consultation, and if no agreement could be reached within a year, the agreement could cease to be effective after another year.

    Regarding France's demand that the military headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization relocate from France, the U.S. note said that "the U.S. government does not understand" why the NATO headquarters should be moved out of France before April 1, 1967. It said that the issue was being studied by other allies, and that "no decision has been made as to when the withdrawal work can be completed." The spirit of the discussion was to "minimize the adverse impact of the withdrawal on the security of the North Atlantic region."

    However, after exerting pressure on France, the note stated that "in view of the attitude of the French government," the United States intends to withdraw its facilities in France. The note expressed "readiness to discuss with the French government the issue of future U.S. military activities in France, as well as arrangements for the use of basic facilities and the conditions for an orderly withdrawal of facilities that will not remain in France."

    De Gaulle reacted quickly to the U.S. actions. Within twenty-four hours of receiving the U.S. note, he immediately convened a three-hour cabinet meeting. French government spokesman Yvon Bourges told reporters after the meeting that De Gaulle said at the cabinet meeting that he would not wait "forever" indefinitely for the United States to make a decision on when to withdraw its troops and bases from France. He believed that "it is meaningless to endlessly hesitate on the timetable." A report from DPA pointed out that De Gaulle's words were a sign of "his unwavering determination regarding the date he set for the complete U.S. withdrawal."

    UPI quoted French government sources as saying that on the issue of U.S. troops and bases, the United States was dwelling on "legal" grounds, but De Gaulle was not interested in "legal" grounds; he was interested only in "restoring and exercising France's full sovereignty over its own territory," and the issue of sovereignty was "non-negotiable."

    At the same time, De Gaulle also instructed his Minister of Defense, Pierre Messmer, to order the cancellation of the annual ceremony commemorating the U.S. war dead in the Battle of Liberation of Paris in 1944. For twenty years, this commemorative ceremony had been held in Paris every year on June 10th.

### 约翰逊政府的“缓兵之计”遭到有力反击  法国坚持要美国如期撤出军队  戴高乐表示不能容许美国拖延撤军时间

    约翰逊政府的“缓兵之计”遭到有力反击
    法国坚持要美国如期撤出军队
    戴高乐表示不能容许美国拖延撤军时间
    据新华社十三日讯　美国和法国在美军和基地撤离法国领土的时间和条件问题上正在展开一场新的交锋。
    美国十二日递交一份照会给法国政府，一方面对法国限期美军和基地在一年内撤离法国领土的要求采取拖延策略，同时提出财政赔偿和停止供给驻西德法军核弹头等问题，对法国进行粗暴的威胁和讹诈。
    同一天，美国国务院发表了国务卿腊斯克对法国《巴黎竞赛画报》记者的一篇谈话，他在谈话中攻击法国不同盟国磋商就作出退出北大西洋集团军事一体化的决定是“从根本上破坏国际协定的庄严性”。
    美国的照会是给法国三月二十九日提出美军和基地撤退时间表的备忘录的答复。这个照会表明，美国想以“整个联盟的安全”为借口，在法国多赖一些时候。它说，美军是根据美法双边协议留驻法国的，而取消协议需要两国政府一致同意。美国政府“不能同意”一九六七年四月一日这个限期，“认为这种仓促的行动会损害联盟全体成员的安全利益”。
    照会还进一步要求规定一年为磋商期间，如果在一年内不能取得一致意见，协议可以再过一年以后停止生效。
    关于法国要求北大西洋集团军事司令部迁离法国的问题，美国的照会说，“美国政府不了解”，为什么北大西洋公约组织总部应在一九六七年四月一日以前迁出法国。它说，这个问题正由其他盟国研究中，“还没有决定什么时候可以完成撤退工作”，讨论的精神是要使撤退“对北大西洋地区安全的不利影响缩小到最低限度”。
    然而，在对法国横施压力之后，这个照会说，“鉴于法国政府的态度”，美国打算撤出它在法国的设施。照会表示“准备同法国政府商讨美国今后在法国的军事活动的问题以及关于使用基本设施的安排和有条不紊地撤退不留在法国的设施的条件”。
    戴高乐对美国的行动反应迅速。他在接到美国照会后不出二十四小时立即召开了长达三小时的内阁会议。法国政府发言人伊冯·布歇在会后对记者透露，戴高乐在内阁会议上说，他不会“永远”无限期地等待美国作出什么时候把军队和基地撤出法国的决定。他认为“在时间表上永远犹豫不决地拖下去是没有意义的”。德新社的消息指出，戴高乐的话是一种迹象，“表明对于他规定的美国完全撤走的日期毫不让步的决心”。
    合众国际社引用法国政府人士的话说，在美军和基地问题上，美国纠缠“法律”根据，但是戴高乐对“法律”根据不感兴趣，他感兴趣的只是“恢复和行使法国在自己领土上的充分主权”，而主权问题是“不能谈判的”。
    同时，戴高乐还指令他的国防部长梅斯梅尔下令取消一年一度为纪念一九四四年解放巴黎战役中的美国阵亡将士而举行的仪式。二十年来，这个纪念仪式每年六月十日在巴黎举行。
