    Xinhua News Agency, Santo Domingo, 28th – Santo Domingo residents held two demonstrations on the 27th to commemorate the first anniversary of the victory of patriotic military and civilians in resisting the tank forces of the pro-American dictatorial regime, and to protest against the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism.
    The two demonstrations were held in the vicinity of the Duarte Bridge in the eastern suburbs, the then battlefield. This important bridge led to the San Isidro Air Force Base, the last stronghold occupied by the dictatorial regime at the time. At that time, the dictatorial regime sent a tank force from this base to counterattack, but the patriotic military and civilians held the bridge and repelled the tank force's offensive. The very next day, the U.S. interventionist troops brazenly landed and carried out armed aggression.
    The masses participating in the demonstration laid wreaths at the nearby martyrs' tombs to pay tribute to these heroic Dominican patriots who sacrificed their lives.
    According to reports, on the same day, the U.S. invading troops committed new crimes. A U.S. guard guarding the U.S. Embassy shot and killed a shoe-shining child, an atrocity that aroused great anger among the Dominican people. The United Press International acknowledged that U.S. military authorities were "panicked" by the possible reaction of this atrocity among the Dominican people, and "shortly after the incident, ordered the strengthening of the guard of the building (the U.S. Embassy)."
    According to reports, the people of the capital of the Dominican Republic will hold a march in front of the U.S. Embassy on the 28th, the first anniversary of the landing of the U.S. invading troops, to protest against the U.S. aggressors. The Dominican University Student Union called on people from all walks of life on the 27th to participate in this anti-U.S. demonstration and to hang Dominican national flags tied with black ribbons to resolutely fight for the motherland suffering from U.S. intervention. The picture shows the anti-U.S. demonstration of the Dominican people.

    纪念爱国军民武装起义一周年
    多米尼加人民连续示威抗议美帝侵略
    新华社二十八日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都圣多明各居民二十七日举行两次示威，纪念爱国军民胜利抗击亲美独裁政权的坦克部队的战役一周年，抗议美帝国主义的武装侵略。
    这两起示威是在当时的战场、东郊杜亚尔特桥一带举行的。这座重要的桥梁通向当时独裁政权盘踞的最后据点圣伊西德罗空军基地。当时，独裁政权从这基地派出了一支坦克部队进行反扑，爱国军民坚守了这座桥梁，击退了坦克部队的进攻。在这第二天，美国干涉军就悍然登陆，进行武装侵略。
    参加示威的群众在附近的烈士墓前献了花圈，向这些英勇牺牲的多米尼加爱国者致敬。
    据报道，就在同一天，美国侵略军又犯下了新的罪行。一个守卫美国大使馆的美国卫兵开枪打死了一个擦皮鞋的儿童，这一暴行引起了多米尼加人民的极大愤怒。美国合众国际社承认，美国军事当局对这一暴行可能在多米尼加人民中产生的反应“表现惊惶失措”，“事故发生不久，就命令加强了大厦（美国大使馆）的警卫。”
    据报道，多米尼加首都人民在二十八日美国侵略军登陆一周年的时候，将在美国大使馆前举行抗议美国侵略者的游行。多米尼加大学生联合会在二十七日号召各界人民参加这次反美示威和悬挂系着黑布带的多米尼加国旗，为遭受美国干涉的祖国进行坚决斗争。图为多米尼加人民的反美示威游行
