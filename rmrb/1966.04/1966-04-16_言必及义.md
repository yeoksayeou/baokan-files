    What kind of ideology should be used to educate peasants? What kind of enthusiasm of the peasants should be mobilized? What standards should be used for commendation and criticism? These questions are well raised.
    What is the fundamental task of rural work cadres? It is to lead the peasants in building a new socialist countryside. Therefore, all work must adhere to the socialist direction, be conducive to the development of socialism, and never for a moment forget to instill socialist ideology in the peasants, and constantly improve the socialist consciousness of the peasants. This is our grand strategy for a hundred years, for a thousand years.
    The peasants, especially the poor and lower-middle peasants, have a high degree of socialist enthusiasm from the perspective of their class interests, which is the basic guarantee for building a new socialist countryside. However, they have not been on the road of collectivization for a long time. To eliminate the influence of the private ownership concepts and habits of small producers on them for thousands of years, they must be educated for a long time; the spontaneous capitalist tendencies of rich peasants must be constantly combated. If we do not insist on guiding the peasants in the socialist direction, do not educate the peasants with Mao Zedong Thought at all times and in all places, and do not use proletarian politics to deal with problems, we will inevitably encourage the capitalist tendencies of some people and impact the socialist collective economy.
    Comrade Mao Zedong said: "The serious problem is the education of the peasants." He also pointed out: "As long as we relax the political work for the peasants slightly in the cooperative movement, and even in a long period thereafter, capitalist tendencies will run rampant." Do the comrades working in the countryside understand this very thoroughly and do it very well? Do the phenomena mentioned by Comrades Liu Jun and Zhang Zhixue also exist in the daily work of the county committee comrades? It seems very necessary to re-study Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings and use them to examine our thoughts and work.

    言必及义
    用什么思想教育农民？调动农民的哪种积极性？用什么标准进行表扬和批评？这些问题提得很好。
    农村工作干部的根本任务是什么？就是领导农民建设社会主义新农村。因此，任何工作都必须坚持社会主义方向，有利于社会主义的发展，一时一刻也不忘记向农民灌输社会主义思想，不断提高农民的社会主义觉悟。这是我们的百年大计，千年大计。
    农民，尤其是贫下中农，从他们的阶级利益出发，有很高的社会主义积极性，这是建设社会主义新农村的基本保证。但是，他们走上集体化道路的时间还不算长，要想消除千百年来小生产者的私有观念和习惯势力对他们的影响，必须进行长时间的教育；对富裕农民的自发的资本主义倾向，更要进行不断的斗争。我们如果不坚持用社会主义方向去引导农民，不时时处处用毛泽东思想教育农民，不用无产阶级的政治来处理问题，那就必然助长某些人的资本主义倾向，冲击社会主义的集体经济。
    毛泽东同志说：“严重的问题是教育农民。”他还指出：“只要我们在合作化运动中，乃至以后一个很长的时期内，稍微放松了对于农民的政治工作，资本主义倾向就会泛滥起来。”对于这一点，在农村工作的同志们是不是懂得很透彻、做得很好呢？象刘钧、张志学同志谈到的那些现象，在县委同志们的日常工作里是否也存在呢？重新温习毛泽东同志的教导，用来检查我们的思想和工作，看来是很有必要的。
