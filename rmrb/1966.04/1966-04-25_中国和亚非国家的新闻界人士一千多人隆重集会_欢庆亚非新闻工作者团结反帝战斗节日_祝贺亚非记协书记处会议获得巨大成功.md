    Chinese and Asian-African journalists, numbering over a thousand, gathered solemnly this afternoon to celebrate the "Asian-African Journalists Day" – a day of solidarity and struggle for Asian-African journalists – and to congratulate the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on its tremendous success.
    Liu Ningyi, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Liao Chengzhi, Chairman of the Chinese Committee for Asian-African Solidarity, and heads of various people's organizations attended the meeting.
    The atmosphere of struggle and solidarity among Asian-African journalists permeated the venue. The emblem of the Asian-African Journalists Association was hung in the center of the rostrum.
    At 3:00 PM, Liu Ningyi, Liao Chengzhi, Cha Hallato, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Mei Yi, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, and heads of various national delegations attending the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association ascended the rostrum, and the audience burst into warm applause. A group of Young Pioneers went on stage to present flowers to the representatives.
    The meeting was presided over by Mei Yi. After announcing the opening of the meeting, Cha Hallato, Secretary-General of the Asian-African Journalists Association, and Fan Jin, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, delivered speeches.
    In his speech, Cha Hallato said that on today, as we celebrate Asian-African Journalists Day, we see that the world situation is excellent, and the main current of the struggle of progressive and revolutionary people in various countries against imperialism, colonialism, and neo-colonialism headed by the United States is constantly rising.
    Cha Hallato told everyone that the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association had successfully completed its various tasks and had come to a victorious close. He introduced the political and organizational achievements of the meeting. Cha Hallato said that all the resolutions of this meeting were formulated based on the guiding principles elucidated in the Jakarta Declaration. The meeting exposed the lies of yellow press journalists who claimed to support the Bandung Spirit and the Jakarta Declaration, but in reality, they have become running dogs of imperialism, thrown themselves into the arms of the imperialists, defended fascist atrocities, and covered up facts about suppression, barbarism, and anti-democratic, anti-people conspiracies.
    Cha Hallato said, we believe that every time we commemorate Asian-African Journalists Day, we will be at a higher stage of struggle; we believe that the course of history is unstoppable, and cannot be stopped by reactionaries, nor by those who talk about revolutionary struggle but actually harm the struggle of the people of various countries and serve imperialism; we believe that the progressive journalists and other progressive forces who contribute to this struggle will continue to increase, so that imperialism will soon be doomed to extinction.
    Fan Jin, Vice Chairman of the All-China Journalists Association, delivered a speech. She pointed out that we are now at a historical juncture of a fierce life-and-death struggle between the people of the world and U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries are developing in depth. No reactionary counter-current can stop the victorious advance of the revolutionary people of the world. In the Asian-African region, and throughout the world, a new and great anti-U.S. revolutionary storm is brewing. The current world revolutionary situation is very good, and U.S. imperialism and its running dogs are carrying out desperate struggles. The Soviet revisionist leading clique is acting as an accomplice of U.S. imperialism, doing its utmost to carry out all kinds of evil deeds to undermine the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, and even deliberately trying to sell out the interests of the Vietnamese people, attempting to extinguish the flames of the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. However, no matter how hard the Soviet revisionist leading clique works to serve the anti-revolutionary global strategy of the United States, it will absolutely not save the life of U.S. imperialism. On the contrary, it will only further expose its own ugly face of being the enemy of the people of the world and suffer historical punishment.
    Fan Jin emphasized that because modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leading group has completely degenerated into an accomplice of U.S. imperialism, the people of all countries must oppose modern revisionism in order to oppose U.S. imperialism. The broadest and most genuine international anti-U.S. united front of the people of the world absolutely does not include the accomplices and accomplices of U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionist leading group's loud shouts about so-called "joint action" are aimed at concealing their true face of uniting with U.S. imperialism and opposing the revolutionary people of the world. We must resolutely expose their conspiracy.
    Fan Jin said that U.S. imperialism, reactionaries of various countries, and modern revisionists centered on the Soviet leadership are extremely hateful of the Asian-African Journalists Association, which holds high the banner of solidarity against imperialism. They have tried every possible means to undermine the cause of solidarity and anti-imperialism of Asian-African journalists, but they will inevitably suffer a shameful defeat.
    Fan Jin condemned the Indonesian reactionaries for colluding with imperialism to carry out counter-revolution, causing the birthplace of the "Jakarta Declaration" to temporarily change color. Their bloody hands have turned the entire Indonesia into a hell on earth, and they vainly attempt to further undermine the work of the Asian-African Journalists Association. She said that imperialism and the Indonesian reactionaries can be rampant for a while, but they can never determine the fate of the Indonesian people. The dark clouds will surely pass, and the people's Indonesia will surely be reborn in the revolutionary fire.
    Foreign representatives attending the Fourth Plenary Meeting (Enlarged) of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association also spoke at the meeting (see page 4 for excerpts of speeches), unanimously expressing their determination to hold high the banner of solidarity against imperialism of the Asian-African Journalists Association. They were: Hoang Van Li of South Vietnam, Benazouz of Algeria, Ri Morrison of Azania (South Africa), Roger Touch of Cambodia, Udayadamma of Ceylon, Sebastien Ramazani, head of the delegation of the National Liberation Committee of Congo (L), Jean-Baptiste Dien of Guinea, Supeno of Indonesia, Yuichi Kobayashi of Japan, Kang Sang Wi of Korea, Zhalun Wengsangang of Laos, Lassina Kane of Mali, Valentim Cissol of Mozambique, Abbas of Palestine, Abu Kubus of Syria, George Wulata of Tanzania, Ibrahim Sayed Bassi of the United Arab Republic, and Don Muvuti of Zimbabwe.
    All the speeches at the meeting today were welcomed.

    中国和亚非国家的新闻界人士一千多人隆重集会
    欢庆亚非新闻工作者团结反帝战斗节日  祝贺亚非记协书记处会议获得巨大成功
    查禾多、范瑾和亚非各国代表讲话一致表示要高举亚非记协团结反帝的旗帜
    据新华社二十四日讯　一千五百多名中国和亚非国家的新闻工作者，今天下午隆重集会，热烈庆祝亚非新闻工作者团结战斗的节日——“亚非新闻工作者日”，祝贺亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）获得巨大的成功。
    人大常委会副委员长刘宁一，中国亚非团结委员会主席廖承志，以及各人民团体的负责人出席了大会。
    会场上洋溢着亚非新闻工作者战斗、团结的气氛。主席台正中悬挂着亚非新闻工作者协会的会徽。
    下午三时，刘宁一、廖承志和亚非新闻工作者协会总书记查禾多，中华全国新闻工作者协会副主席梅益以及出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的各国代表团团长走上主席台，全场响起了热烈的掌声。一群少先队员上台向代表们献花。
    大会由梅益主持，他宣布开会以后，亚非记协总书记查禾多、中华全国新闻工作者协会副主席范瑾在会上讲话。
    查禾多在会上说，在今天庆祝亚非新闻工作者日的时候，我们看到世界形势大好，各国进步和革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义、殖民主义和新殖民主义的斗争的主流正在不断高涨。
    查禾多告诉大家，亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）完满地完成各项任务，已经胜利闭幕。他介绍了这次会议在政治上、组织上取得的成就。查禾多说，这次会议所有的决议都是根据雅加达宣言所阐明的指导原则制定的。会议揭露了黄色报刊新闻界人士的谎言，他们口称拥护万隆精神和雅加达宣言，但实际上他们已经变成了帝国主义的走狗，投入了帝国主义者的怀抱，为法西斯暴行辩护，掩盖关于镇压、野蛮行为和反民主反人民勾当的事实。
    查禾多说，我们相信，每当我们纪念亚非新闻工作者日的时候，我们将会处在斗争的更高的阶段；我们相信历史的进程是不可阻挡的，反动派不能阻挡，那些嘴上谈革命斗争但实际上在行动中损害各国人民的斗争为帝国主义效劳的人，也不能阻挡；我们相信为这个斗争作出贡献的进步新闻工作者和其他进步力量会不断增加，从而使帝国主义不久将趋于灭亡。
    中华全国新闻工作者协会副主席范瑾讲话。她指出，我们今天正处在世界人民同美帝国主义及其走狗进行你死我活的剧烈搏斗的历史关头。各国人民的反帝革命斗争正在深入发展。任何反动的逆流都不能阻挡世界革命人民胜利前进。在亚非地区，在全世界范围内，正酝酿着一个新的、伟大的反美革命风暴。当前世界革命形势好得很，美帝国主义及其走狗正在进行着绝望的挣扎。苏联修正主义领导集团在充当美帝国主义的帮凶，竭力进行各种破坏世界人民革命斗争的罪恶勾当，甚至蓄意要出卖越南人民的利益，企图扑灭越南人民抗美救国斗争的烈火。但是，不管苏联修正主义领导集团怎样卖力地为美国的反革命全球战略效劳，都绝对救不了美帝国主义的命，相反的，只能更加暴露他们自己同世界人民为敌的丑恶面目，遭到历史的惩罚。
    范瑾强调说，由于以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义已完全堕落成为美帝国主义的帮凶，各国人民要反对美帝国主义，就必须反对现代修正主义。全世界人民最广泛的、最真实的国际反美统一战线，决不包括美帝国主义的帮凶和同谋者在内。苏联修正主义领导集团大叫大喊所谓“联合行动”，目的是掩饰他们同美帝国主义联合，反对世界革命人民的真面目，我们要坚决揭露他们的阴谋。
    范瑾说，美帝国主义、各国反动派和以苏联领导为中心的现代修正主义者，极端仇恨高举团结反帝旗帜的亚非记协。它们千方百计企图破坏亚非新闻工作者团结反帝的事业，但是，它们必将遭到可耻的失败。
    范瑾谴责印度尼西亚反动派同帝国主义勾结进行反革命，使《雅加达宣言》的诞生地暂时改变了颜色。他们血腥的双手，把整个印度尼西亚变成为人间地狱，并且妄想进一步破坏亚非记协的工作。她说，帝国主义和印度尼西亚反动派可以逞凶于一时，却绝对决定不了印度尼西亚人民的命运。乌云一定会过去，人民的印度尼西亚必将在革命的烈火中获得新生。
    出席亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的各外国代表也在会上讲了话（讲话摘要见第四版），一致表示要高举亚非新闻工作者协会团结反帝的旗帜。他们是：越南南方代表黄万里、阿尔及利亚代表贝纳佐兹、阿扎尼亚（南非）代表里·摩里逊、柬埔寨代表罗杰多、锡兰代表乌达亚达马、刚果（利）全国解放委员会代表团团长塞巴斯蒂安·拉马扎尼、几内亚代表让·巴蒂斯特·迪恩、印度尼西亚代表苏佩诺、日本代表小林雄一、朝鲜代表姜相渭、老挝代表扎伦·翁桑昂、马里代表拉西纳·卡内、莫三鼻给代表瓦朗蒂姆·西索尔、巴勒斯坦代表阿巴斯、叙利亚代表阿布库斯、坦桑尼亚代表乔治·伍拉塔、阿联代表易卜拉欣·赛义德·巴西、津巴布韦代表唐·穆伍蒂。
    今天在会上所有的讲话都受到了欢迎。
    应邀参加今天大会的，有出席亚非记协书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）的全体代表，以及越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表黎松山，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表帕荣·朱拉暖，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛和在北京的亚非新闻工作者。
    今天的大会是由亚非新闻工作者协会和中华全国新闻工作者协会联合举办的。中华全国新闻工作者协会、我国各人民团体和有关方面负责人，以及首都新闻界著名人士楚图南、吴德峰、刘白羽、杨朔、王芸生、王揖、邓岗、安岗、茅以升、曹孟君、王志杰、傅德喜、张明卿等出席了大会。
