    Following the emergence of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han, in June 1961, also tossed out his article "Yu Qian, National Hero of the Ming Dynasty." Why, at this time, did Comrade Wu Han, who was so enthusiastic about studying Hai Rui, suddenly become interested in Yu Qian? Comrade Wu Han has always advocated "making the past serve the present," so we must ask Comrade Wu Han, what exactly is the purpose of elevating Yu Qian at this time?
    To clarify this issue, we must first know what Comrade Wu Han propagated in this article. This article, less than ten thousand words long, on the surface seems to merely describe Yu Qian's life plainly. However, upon careful reading, one will discover that Comrade Wu Han deliberately emphasized the following points:
    First, the "Minister of War" (Defense Minister - a note added by Comrade Wu Han himself) Yu Qian was a person who wholeheartedly served the people and "made great contributions" to the country. The article states that Yu Qian was an official who was "upright and honest" and did many good things for the people. For example, when Yu Qian was inspecting Jiangxi, he "discovered hundreds of unjust cases and reversed them all." Another example: when Yu Qian served as Governor of Henan and Shanxi, he "attached great importance to investigation and research. As soon as he took office, he rode around inspecting everywhere. Wherever he went, he invited local elders to talk with him, understand the local situation, political gains and losses, the burdens and suffering of the people, what should and should not be done. When he discovered problems, he immediately put forward concrete opinions and wrote reports to the Emperor. When there were floods or droughts, he also reported them in a timely manner and provided relief. He was very clear about the local situation, and his political measures were also very timely, and therefore, he received the praise and support of the people." The article analyzes that Yu Qian was able to do good things because he first received the support of Emperor Yingzong and the "relatively upright" "veteran and important ministers" the Three Yangs. Later, he also received the support of Emperor Jingtai. With the support of the Emperor, Yu Qian was promoted to Minister of War and led the "Defense of Beijing," "protected Beijing City," and "made great contributions." The article tries to make people believe that this "Defense Minister" was "naturally simple and frugal" and "worried about the country day and night, not caring about family life."
    Second, although "the common people liked" Yu Qian "very much," the "powerful and influential" hated him because he hindered their struggle for power and profit, so they opposed him everywhere and killed him after Emperor Yingzong was restored to the throne. The obvious conclusion is that Yu Qian was killed by bad people because Emperor Yingzong was昏庸, and this was a great miscarriage of justice.
    Third, the final victory still belonged to Yu Qian. On the one hand, Wu Han tried to make people believe that although Yu Qian died, the "broad masses of people" "deeply mourned" him; on the other hand, he also told people that by the time of Emperor Xianzong, Yu Qian was finally restored to "reputation."
    So, is Yu Qian really such a person as Comrade Wu Han described? We believe that as long as one does not have any prejudice, stands on the position of the proletariat, and seriously analyzes the existing historical materials from a Marxist viewpoint, one will come to this conclusion: Yu Qian, who served as the Ming Dynasty's "Defense Minister," could only be a loyal servant of the feudal ruling class, and his words and deeds were all for the purpose of consolidating the Ming Dynasty's reactionary rule. His struggle with the so-called "powerful and influential" was only a struggle within the ruling class, and neither side represented the interests of the people in the slightest. From the people's point of view, there was no question of injustice or injustice in Yu Qian's death. What is strange is why Comrade Wu Han, who calls himself a Marxist historian, completely beautifies Yu Qian according to the views of the ruling class's "official books"? Is it accidental? Is it without purpose? Absolutely not. To clarify the truth, one must look for the reasons politically and track down the pursuit in the class struggle.
    As many comrades have correctly pointed out, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" when the right-leaning opportunists began to frantically attack the Party, using Hai Rui's mouth to scold our beloved Party Central Committee and encourage monsters and demons to attack the Party. Later, at the Lushan Conference, the right-leaning opportunists were criticized and "dismissed" from their "official positions." Therefore, Comrade Wu Han hurriedly wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to praise them for "not yielding and not losing heart" after losing their official positions and to encourage them to "try again after failing." In early 1961, the Party convened the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee and put forward the方針 of adjustment, consolidation, filling out, and improvement. At this time, the right-leaning opportunists thought they had an opportunity and tried to distort the essence of the Party's 八字方針. They slandered that the Party's past line was wrong, nonsensically saying that the 八字方針 was used to correct deviations, thereby spreading the idea that the criticism of right-leaning opportunists was wrong and must be reversed. Thus, the "wind of reversing verdicts" became increasingly fierce. Under these circumstances, Comrade Wu Han felt that merely tossing out "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was not enough to adapt to this "excellent situation," especially not enough to explain the future of the "wind of reversing verdicts." Therefore, Comrade Wu Han racked his brains again and finally found a "Defense Minister" Yu Qian of the Ming Dynasty to help. In June, Comrade Wu Han himself wrote "Yu Qian, National Hero of the Ming Dynasty"; in November, under the direction of Comrade Wu Han, "Small Series of Chinese History" published "Yu Qian"; then some people responded to Comrade Wu Han's call, wrote articles, and published pamphlets, forming a trend of widely discussing Yu Qian.
    How does Comrade Wu Han's spending so much effort to promote Yu Qian serve his political needs? To put it bluntly, it is nothing more than the following three aspects:
    First, Comrade Wu Han is telling the right-leaning opportunists here that they should not only have Hai Rui's spirit of "trying again after failing," but also like Yu Qian, "not be afraid of being burned by fierce fire, not be afraid of being crushed to pieces, but leave a clear reputation in the world"; not only should they reverse the verdicts while alive, but also let their sons reverse the verdicts after they die. Comrade Wu Han also told the right-leaning opportunists that the people "like" you very much, the people will never forget you, your "political enemies" will "fail one after another," your "reputation" will eventually be "restored," and the final victory belongs to you. Comrade Wu Han's entire article is emboldening the right-leaning opportunists, asking them to adhere to the anti-Party and anti-socialist position and continue to attack the Party, taking the opportunity to make a big fuss about reversing verdicts.
    Second, Comrade Wu Han here tries to make people believe that our beloved Party is like the "powerful and influential" of the Ming Dynasty, a group that fights for private interests, while the right-leaning opportunists like Yu Qian, who are "for the country and the people," have become a thorn in the side of the "powerful and influential," which is why they were criticized and dismissed from their official positions. The purpose of Comrade Wu Han's efforts to exaggerate this point is nothing more than to incite the people to support the right-leaning opportunists in reversing verdicts and carrying out anti-Party activities.
    Third, this article is Comrade Wu Han's direct challenge to the Party. The article is crying injustice for the right-leaning opportunists, saying that they are "upright officials" like Yu Qian, people who "worry about the country day and night," and people who have "made great contributions." The Party not only does not reuse them, but also dismisses them from their official positions, which is a huge mistake. Comrade Wu Han is holding the Party hostage, demanding that it quickly reverse the verdicts for the right-leaning opportunists, otherwise they will not give up.
    Comrade Wu Han is engaged in history and is best at using historical analogies to serve reality, often achieving his political goals through this method, and considers himself very clever. However, as long as we peel off his mask, his reactionary essence will be nakedly exposed.
    In his article "Yu Qian, National Hero of the Ming Dynasty," Comrade Wu Han vainly attempts to use Yu Qian to incite the right-leaning opportunists to reverse verdicts, in order to change our Party's correct line and restore capitalism, which is fundamentally impossible. His vicious anti-Party and anti-socialist face must be thoroughly exposed.

    抬出于谦来干什么？		张静如　彭万春　曲家齐
    继《海瑞罢官》出笼以后，一九六一年六月，吴晗同志又抛出了他的《明代民族英雄于谦》一文。为什么这个时候，热心研究海瑞的吴晗同志又突然对于谦发生了兴趣呢？吴晗同志向来是主张“古为今用”的，那么我们就要问问吴晗同志在这个时候抬出个于谦来究竟是干什么用的呢？
    要弄清这个问题，首先要知道吴晗同志在这篇文章中宣扬了些什么东西。这篇不到一万字的文章，从表面看来似乎只是平淡地描述了于谦的生平，但是认真读一下，就会发现吴晗同志着意渲染了以下几个观点：
    第一，“兵部尚书”（国防部长——吴晗同志自己加的注）于谦是个一心为人民的人，给国家“立了大功”。文章说，于谦为官“清正”，为人民办了不少好事。比如，于谦巡按江西的时候，“发见有几百件冤枉的案件，都给平反了”。又如，于谦作河南山西巡抚的时候，“极重视调查研究工作，一上任便骑马到处视察，所到地方都延请当地有年纪的人谈话，了解地方情况，政治上的得失利弊，老百姓的负担、痛苦，该办的和不该办的事，发现问题，立刻提出具体意见，写报告给皇帝，遇有水灾、旱灾，也及时上报，进行救济。他对地方的情况很清楚，政治上的措施也很及时，因之，得到人民的歌颂和支持。”文章分析说，于谦所以能办好事，是因为先得到英宗和“比较正直”的“元老重臣”三杨的支持。后又得到景泰帝的支持。在皇帝的支持下，于谦升为兵部尚书，领导了“北京的保卫战”，“保住了北京城”，“立了大功”。文章力图使人相信，这位“国防部长”“生性朴素俭约”，“日日夜夜为国家操心，不问家庭生活”。
    第二，“老百姓虽然很喜欢”于谦，“权贵”们却因为他妨碍了自己争权夺利，所以“恨死了他”，处处反对他，并且在英宗复位后杀害了他。明显的结论是，由于英宗昏庸，于谦才被坏人害死，这是一件大冤狱。
    第三，最后胜利的还是于谦。吴晗一方面力图使人相信，于谦虽然死了，“广大人民”却“深深悼念”他；另方面还告诉人们，到了宪宗的时候，于谦终于被恢复了“名誉”。
    那么，于谦究竟是不是象吴晗同志所说的这样一个人物呢？我们认为，只要不带什么偏见，站在无产阶级立场，用马克思主义的观点认真分析一下现有的历史材料，就会得出这样的结论：作过明朝“国防部长”的于谦只能是封建统治阶级的忠实奴仆，他的一言一行都是为巩固明朝反动统治服务的。他同所谓“权贵”之间的斗争只不过是统治阶级内部的斗争，无论哪一方都丝毫不代表人民的利益。于谦之死，从人民的立场上看，根本没有冤与不冤的问题。奇怪的是，为什么自封为马克思主义的历史学家的吴晗同志却完全按照统治阶级的“官书”的观点极力美化于谦呢？是偶然的吗？是毫无目的的吗？完全不是。要想弄清事实的真相，必须从政治上寻找原因，从阶级斗争中去跟踪追击。
    正如许多同志已经正确指出来的，吴晗同志在右倾机会主义分子开始猖狂向党进攻的时候，写了《海瑞骂皇帝》，借海瑞之口大骂我们敬爱的党中央，鼓励牛鬼蛇神向党进攻。后来，在庐山会议上，右倾机会主义分子受到批判，“罢”了
  “官”，于是，吴晗同志就赶紧写《海瑞罢官》，歌颂他们丢了官“并不屈服，不丧气”，鼓励他们
  “失败了再干”。到了一九六一年初，党召开了八届九中全会，提出了调整、巩固、充实、提高的方针。这个时候，右倾机会主义分子认为有机可乘，力图歪曲党的八字方针的实质。他们诬蔑过去党的路线错了，胡说什么八字方针就是用来纠偏的，从而散布对右倾机会主义分子的批判是错误的，必须翻案。于是，“翻案风”就越刮越凶。在这种情况下，吴晗同志感觉到只是抛出《海瑞罢官》还不足以适应这种“大好形势”，特别不足以说明刮“翻案风”的前途。于是，吴晗同志就又苦思苦想，终于找出个明代的“国防部长”于谦来帮忙。六月，吴晗同志自己写了《明代民族英雄于谦》；十一月，在吴晗同志主持下，《中国历史小丛书》出了《于谦》；接着一些人响应吴晗同志的号召，写文章，出小册子，形成大讲于谦之风。
    吴晗同志花这么大力气宣扬于谦，究竟怎样为其政治上的需要服务呢？说穿了，不外以下三个方面：
    第一，吴晗同志在这里告诉右倾机会主义分子不仅要有海瑞的“失败了再干”的精神，而且还要象于谦那样，“不怕烈火焚，不怕粉骨碎身，要留下清白在人间”；不仅活着要翻案，就是死了也要让自己的儿子翻案。吴晗同志还告诉右倾机会主义分子，人民是“很喜欢”你们的，人民对你们念念不忘，你们的“政敌”都会“先后失败”，你们的“名誉”终究会“恢复”，最后胜利是属于你们的。吴晗同志的全篇文章都是在给右倾机会主义分子壮胆，要他们坚持反党反社会主义的立场，继续向党进攻，乘机大闹翻案。
    第二，吴晗同志在这里力图使人们相信，我们敬爱的党象明朝的“权贵”一样，是个争私利的集团，而象于谦一样的“为国为民”的右倾机会主义分子却成为“权贵”的眼中钉，所以才受批判，才被罢官。吴晗同志竭力渲染这一点的目的，不过是妄想煽动人民起来支持右倾机会主义分子闹翻案，进行反党活动。
    第三，这篇文章是吴晗同志直接向党的挑战书。文章为右倾机会主义分子喊冤，说他们是象于谦一样的“清官”，是“日日夜夜为国家操心”的人，是“立了大功”的人。党不仅不重用他们，反而罢了他们的官，这是天大的错误。吴晗同志要挟党赶紧给右倾机会主义分子翻案，否则他们是不会善罢甘休的。
    吴晗同志是搞历史的，最善于用历史的比拟为现实服务，经常以这种手法达到其政治目的，并且自以为非常巧妙。但是，只要我们剥开了他的画皮，就会赤裸裸地暴露出他的反动本质。
    吴晗同志在《明代民族英雄于谦》一文中，妄图利用于谦煽动右倾机会主义分子闹翻案，以改变我们党的正确路线，复辟资本主义，是根本办不到的。他的这种恶毒的反党反社会主义的嘴脸，必须彻底予以揭穿。
