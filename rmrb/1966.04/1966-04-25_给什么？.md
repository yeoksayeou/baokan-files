    What to Give?
    It is very necessary for the state to provide some material support to difficult and disaster-stricken areas, which demonstrates the superiority of our socialist system. How should we view this support? How should we make good use of the materials supported by the state? There is a struggle between two different ideologies here.
    One ideology is to explain the political significance of state support to farmers, educate the masses to work hard and carry forward the spirit of self-reliance; the other ideology is to look upwards, wait for state support, and as a result, foster the masses' dependence mentality.
    Two ideologies, two results. Comrades in Pinglu County have a deep understanding. They have suffered enough from emphasizing material things, and are beginning to taste the sweetness of emphasizing politics. From this issue, they truly understand the principle that politics is the commander and the soul.
    Self-reliance is a fundamental policy for our country to carry out socialist construction. This policy is based on believing in and relying on the people to liberate themselves. How to implement this policy? How to view the role of materials? Should we simply give materials or give ideology first? How to emphasize politics in dealing with state support? This issue is worth exploring.

    给什么？
    国家给困难地区和灾区一些物资支援，是很必要的，它显示了我们社会主义制度的优越性。怎样看待这种支援？怎样用好国家支援的物资？这里有着两种不同思想的斗争。
    一种思想是，向农民讲清楚国家支援的政治意义，教育群众艰苦奋斗，发扬自力更生精神；另一种思想是，眼睛向上，等待国家支援，结果助长了群众的依赖思想。
    两种思想，两种结果，平鲁县的同志们有深刻的体会。他们吃够了突出物的苦头，开始尝到了突出政治的甜头。从这个问题上，他们真正懂得了政治是统帅、是灵魂的道理。
    自力更生是我们国家进行社会主义建设的一个根本方针。这个方针，是建立在相信和依靠人民群众自己解放自己的思想基础之上的。怎样贯彻执行这个方针？怎样看待物的作用？单纯给物还是先给思想？在对待国家支援上，怎样突出政治？这个问题值得探讨。
