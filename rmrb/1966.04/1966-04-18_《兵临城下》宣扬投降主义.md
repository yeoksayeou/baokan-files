    Editor's Note: Currently, a broad and deep socialist revolution is underway on our country's literary and art front. This is a class struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have already taken up the weapon of literary criticism and actively participate in the struggle. New forces have always defeated decadent forces in the world, and on the literary criticism front, the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers will play an increasingly important role. The article by soldiers and workers criticizing "Enemy at the Gates" published in this newspaper today is part of the contributions from workers, peasants, and soldiers.
    Our literary criticism must follow the mass line, hand over the weapon of literary criticism to the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and combine the criticism of critics with the criticism of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers. The class stand of the masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers is the firmest, their class viewpoint is the clearest, and their class love and hatred are the strongest. They have various comments and opinions on the movies, dramas, novels, storytelling, and ballads they have seen and heard. This is the solid foundation for carrying out mass literary criticism. Firmly relying on this force and uniting the broad masses of revolutionary intellectuals, we will surely be able to completely overthrow all the demons and monsters on the cultural front, fundamentally eliminate the ideology of all exploiting classes that poisons the masses of the people, and strive to implement Comrade Mao Zedong's policy of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and serving socialism.
    "Enemy at the Gates" Promotes Capitulationism
    Tao Ling (Five-Good Soldier), Li Lianjun, Zeng Jiazhen
    The movie "Enemy at the Gates" superficially describes an enemy army uprising, but in reality, it promotes capitulationism towards the enemy. If you don't believe it, look at the image of Minister Jiang, the only senior officer of our army in the film. From beginning to end, he is responsible for contacting and organizing the work of disintegrating the enemy army and instigating the uprising. Such a leader should act in accordance with Chairman Mao's political work principles on disintegrating the enemy army, and his words and deeds should reflect the Party's policies. However, Minister Jiang in the film's director's pen is actually a capitulationist and humanist who is passive, fails everywhere, and begs for peace everywhere. Through this image, the director seriously distorts the political work of our army towards the enemy army.
    Chairman Mao taught us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This question is of primary importance for the revolution." And Minister Jiang made a principled mistake on this fundamental issue. He was so unable to distinguish between the enemy and ourselves, and regarded the enemy as a friend.
    Look at Minister Jiang's attitude towards Zheng Hanchen.
    Zheng Hanchen is a middle-ranking officer of the Kuomintang reactionaries and is an enemy of the people. He was captured while stubbornly resisting our army. In principle, Minister Jiang should use a solemn attitude towards class enemies and prisoners of war to explain to him the policies of our Party and our army, enlighten him with righteousness, and point out a way out for Zheng Hanchen. But Minister Jiang did not do this. Instead, he treated him with the feelings of a class brother and a good friend, comforted him with a smile, cared for him attentively, and tried to make Zheng Hanchen surrender through emotional appeal alone, without struggle. What was the effect? It was Zheng Hanchen's sophistry. Then Minister Jiang took out the newspaper specially prepared for Zheng Hanchen, which recorded Zheng Hanchen's "outstanding military achievements," and waited gently for Zheng Hanchen's transformation. Who knew that Zheng Hanchen not only did not surrender but instead said, "Succeed or die. Kill me if you want! Execute me if you want!" and openly challenged Minister Jiang with his stubborn reactionary stance. Facing the challenge of this prisoner, Minister Jiang should have counterattacked and waged a tit-for-tat struggle, but he used "We will not force you to surrender" as an excuse and released Zheng Hanchen without clarifying anything. This is not the correct attitude towards prisoners of war at all.
    Look again at Minister Jiang's negotiations with Zhao Chongwu.
    Although Zhao Chongwu is the head of a miscellaneous army, he is, after all, a major general of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, a running dog of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. His "major general" star flower is stained with the blood of many revolutionaries. To win over such a person to revolt, one must recognize his reactionary class essence and carry out work according to the Party's policies. But Minister Jiang was not like that. He came to Zhao's house with the illusion of believing in negotiations and hoping that the enemy would be kind. He persuaded and flattered Zhao Chongwu with extremely enthusiastic words, as if he were treating a good comrade and a good friend, and even begged Zhao Chongwu in a humble manner. In negotiations with Zhao Chongwu, he called him "Brother Chongwu" left and right, and further reminisced with Zhao Chongwu about the "glorious history" of the past, asking Zhao Chongwu to realize his "ideal of that year." When Zhao Chongwu said that "the environment is different now," he gently and smilingly pointed out to Zhao that "the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there is no way out, but the willows are dark and the flowers are bright in another village." May I ask, what does this mean? Is it possible that there can be a common "glorious history" and a common "ideal" between our army's commanders and the enemy's reactionary officers? Is it possible that our army's commanders can run to the homes of enemy generals in this way to reminisce about old times? Is it possible that our army's political work is such emotional appeasement? In short, here is full of sentimentalism, full of "human touch." It is precisely in this kind of "human" preaching that the class stand and revolutionary principles of our army's commanders are completely erased, turning them into a complete embodiment of "human nature." However, despite the fact that Minister Jiang talked so much "heart to heart" with Zhao Chongwu and put so much gold on Zhao Chongwu's face, Zhao Chongwu only gave Minister Jiang a sentence, "Let me think about it carefully." Later, Minister Jiang did not wake up, did not recognize the essence of the enemy, and was still waiting bitterly for his "Brother Chongwu," so that he was searched by the enemy and forced to hide in the house of "Brother Chongwu," and finally he was forced to run away in disgrace without even seeing "Brother Chongwu." Before leaving, he still fantasized about "Brother Chongwu" being moved by his appeal and revolting!
    Minister Jiang in the film's director's pen is a complete capitulationist. This is not only a distortion of the image of Minister Jiang but also a serious distortion of Chairman Mao's political work principles on disintegrating the enemy army!

专栏：

    编者按：当前，在我国的文艺战线上，正进行着一场广泛深入的社会主义革命。这是一场兴无灭资的阶级斗争。广大工农兵群众已经拿起文艺批评这个武器，积极参加斗争。世界上从来是新生力量战胜腐朽力量，在文艺批评战线上，工农兵群众必将发挥越来越大的作用。本报今天发表的战士和工人批判《兵临城下》的文章，就是工农兵来稿的一部分。
    我们的文艺评论要走群众路线，要把文艺批评的武器交给工农兵群众去掌握，使评论工作者的评论同工农兵群众的评论结合起来。工农兵群众的阶级立场最坚定，阶级观点最鲜明，阶级爱憎最强烈。他们对于看过的电影、戏剧、小说，听过的评弹、说唱，等等，有各种评论和意见，这就是开展群众性文艺批评的坚实基础。坚定地依靠这支力量，团结广大的革命知识分子，就一定能够彻底打倒文化战线上的一切牛鬼蛇神，从根本上消除一切剥削阶级毒害人民群众的意识形态，为贯彻执行毛泽东同志的文艺为工农兵服务、为社会主义服务的方针而奋斗。
    《兵临城下》宣扬投降主义
    陶岭（五好战士）、李连君　曾家祯
    电影《兵临城下》表面上是在描写敌军起义，实际上却是在宣扬对敌投降主义。不信，请看影片中仅有的一位我军高级干部——姜部长的形象，他从头到尾负责联系和组织这一次的瓦解敌军、策动起义的工作。这样的一位领导人，本来应该按照毛主席关于瓦解敌军的政治工作原则去办事，他的言行要体现党的政策。可是，影片编导者笔下的姜部长，竟是一个处处被动，处处失败，处处乞求和平的投降主义者和人性论者，编导者通过这个形象，严重地歪曲了我军对敌军的政治工作。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”而姜部长正是在这个根本问题上犯了原则性的错误。他是那样地敌我不分，认敌为友。
    请看姜部长对郑汉臣的态度。
    郑汉臣是一个国民党反动派的中级军官，是人民的敌人，他在对我军的顽抗中被俘。按道理说，姜部长应该是用对待阶级敌人，对待俘虏的严正态度，向他讲明我党我军的政策，晓以大义，给郑汉臣指明出路。但姜部长没有这样作，他却以对待阶级弟兄，对待好朋友似的感情，笑容可掬地安慰他，体贴他，无微不至地关怀他，并想不通过斗争，只通过人情的感召来使郑汉臣投降。收到的效果是什么呢？是郑汉臣的狡辩。接着姜部长又拿出特意为郑汉臣准备好的，记有郑汉臣“赫赫战功”的报纸，温和地等待着郑汉臣的转变，谁知郑汉臣不仅不投降，反而说出了“不成功便成仁。要杀就杀！要毙就毙！”的话，以他顽固的反动立场对姜部长公开地进行了政治性的挑战。面对着这个阶下囚徒的挑战，姜部长本应还击，进行针锋相对的斗争，但他却以“我们不勉强你投降”为词，不明不白地把郑汉臣放了。这完全不是对待俘虏的正确态度。
    再看姜部长和赵崇武的谈判。
    赵崇武虽然是个杂牌军的头目，但他毕竟是蒋匪的少将，毕竟是蒋匪的走狗。他那颗“少将”星花上，不知沾满了多少革命者的鲜血。争取这样的人起义，应当认识到他的反动阶级本质，根据党的政策进行工作。但姜部长不是这样，他抱着迷信谈判、希望敌人发善心的幻想来到了赵家。他用对待好同志，对待好朋友的极端热情的言词规劝，吹捧赵崇武，甚至低声下气地哀求赵崇武。在和赵崇武谈判时，左一个“崇武兄”，右一个“崇武兄”，并进一步和赵崇武共忆过去的“光荣历史”，叫赵崇武实现“当年的理想”。当赵崇武说到“现在环境不同了”时，他又温和地、笑咪咪地给赵指出“山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”。请问，这究竟是什么意思呢？难道说，在我军指挥员和敌军反动军官之间，能够有共同的“光荣历史”和共同的“理想”吗？难道说，我军指挥员竟可以如此这般地跑到敌军将领的家里同他们共忆旧情吗？难道说，我军的政治工作就是这样的感情拉拢吗？总之，在这里充满着温情主义，充满着“人情味”。也正是在这种“人情”的说教之中，我军指挥员的阶级立场和革命原则被抹煞得干干净净，变成了一个十足的“人性论”的化身。但是，尽管姜部长和赵崇武“推心置腹”地谈了那么多，往赵崇武脸上贴了那么多金，而赵崇武却只送给姜部长一句“让我好好考虑”。以后姜部长还没省悟，还没认清敌人本质，还在苦苦地等着他的“崇武兄”，以致被敌人搜捕而逼到了“崇武兄”的家里躲藏起来，最后竟连“崇武兄”的面都没见上就被逼得灰溜溜地逃走了。临走时，还念念不忘地幻想着“崇武兄”受了自己的感召而起义呢！
    影片编导者笔下的姜部长是个十足的投降主义者，这不仅是对姜部长形象的歪曲，而且是对毛主席有关瓦解敌军的政治工作原则的严重歪曲！
