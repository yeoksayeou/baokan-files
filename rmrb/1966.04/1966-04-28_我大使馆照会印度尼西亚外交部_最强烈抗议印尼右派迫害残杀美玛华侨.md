    Chinese Embassy lodges note with Indonesian Foreign Ministry
    Strongest protest against Indonesian rightists' persecution and massacre of overseas Chinese in Mema
    Demands that the Indonesian government immediately release all detained overseas Chinese, promptly reply to the Chinese Foreign Ministry's note regarding the repatriation of overseas Chinese, and first assist the suffering overseas Chinese in Mema to return to their motherland as soon as possible.
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, 27th -- News: The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Foreign Ministry on the 25th, lodging the strongest protest with the Indonesian government against the fascist anti-Chinese atrocities of the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in brutally persecuting and massacring overseas Chinese in Mema County, West Nusa Tenggara Province, which caused them great loss of life and property.
    The note said that since mid-January 1966, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have been carrying out racist persecution against the overseas Chinese in Mema County, causing serious damage to their lives and property. On January 11 this year, at about 11 p.m., the military authorities of Mema County arrested five local overseas Chinese, Lai Xieji, Huang Xianzhong, Huang Yinzhang, Huang Zheliu, and Gao Zheling, under the pretext of "protection." At the same time, a large number of reactionary thugs commanded by the army broke into the houses with knives and axes, forced all the overseas Chinese living in Laba (under the jurisdiction of Mema County) to leave their homes, and then looted all their property. At about 3 a.m. the next morning, this group of thugs rushed to Mema, together with more than 2,000 local thugs, and used knives, axes, sticks and other weapons to launch a frenzied attack on more than 140 overseas Chinese households. The thugs forcibly broke into overseas Chinese shops and residences, beating anyone they saw and driving all men, women, old and young out of their houses. Fifteen overseas Chinese, including three women, were cut and beaten on the spot, and countless others were punched, kicked, or struck with sticks. Overseas Chinese Hong Chengcai died of excessive blood loss due to his injuries, Hong Jiazeng's infant died of illness due to fright, Wu Shanyi's abdomen was stabbed with a dagger, his life was in critical condition, Huang Dixing's head was cut with a sharp knife, and his fingers were chopped off, leaving him disabled. After the overseas Chinese were driven out of their houses, the military police, under the pretext of "protecting their safety," used pre-prepared vehicles to forcibly transport them to Laba prison and the county council hall for concentration. At that time, the overseas Chinese were only wearing the clothes on their backs, and were not allowed to carry any other clothes. At about 6 a.m. on the 12th, under the leadership of the military police, groups of thugs entered the shops and residences of the overseas Chinese again and looted and destroyed them at will. All valuable goods, valuable furnishings, as well as clothing, watches, gold and silver jewelry, etc. were looted. The atrocities continued until noon. The local government, under the pretext of "protection," transported the remaining items and furniture of the overseas Chinese to the Laba football field and the front hall of the parliament for concentration, and were looted again by thugs that night. At the same time, the transportation vehicles of the overseas Chinese were requisitioned, and the stocks in the warehouses and the goods newly delivered from Surabaya were confiscated and auctioned off. By this time, all the property of the overseas Chinese in Mema had been lost, and even the doors and windows had been pried open, leaving not a single nail.
    The note said that the atrocities then spread to villages and towns near Mema. One hundred overseas Chinese in Sabah and more than ten overseas Chinese in Keri were also taken to Mema on January 14 and January 29, respectively, after their property was looted, and were imprisoned in concentration camps together with more than 800 overseas Chinese in Mema. They were treated as prisoners, lost their freedom of movement, and suffered inhuman treatment. For example, more than 300 refugees in Laba prison were forced to squeeze into five small cells measuring five meters square, had no clothes to change, could not take showers, and were in a state of semi-starvation all day long, causing many elderly people, women, and infants to suffer and become ill.
    The note said that in order to cover up its heinous crimes, the Mema authorities even attempted to frame the innocent refugees politically, forcing them to admit trumped-up charges through "interrogation," to admit that the banditry of the military police and thugs was "justified," to "voluntarily waive compensation claims" for the losses suffered, and to wantonly provoke the relationship between the overseas Chinese and their motherland. When all these conspiracies failed and these overseas Chinese were illegally detained for more than a month, and they had no choice but to release them, they openly forced the overseas Chinese to hold a so-called "loyalty oath ceremony" under the "supervision and swearing-in" of representatives of the local five-in-one and right-wing reactionary groups. The Mema local authorities tried every possible means to block the news of the atrocities. For nearly two months from January 12, the overseas Chinese were not allowed to go out, and overseas Chinese from other places were not allowed to enter Mema, and the victims were threatened: "If you report the truth to the Chinese Embassy, and Beijing Radio broadcasts it, be careful of suffering." Until now, overseas Chinese Huang Xianzhong, Huang Yinzhang, Huang Zheliu, Gao Zheling, Gao Zheshui, Fu Shunzong and others are still being held as hostages.
    The note pointed out that the racist atrocities committed by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces in Mema are appalling. The facts fully show that this crime was committed by the Mema local authorities and armed forces in collusion with the thugs of right-wing organizations, and is a big conspiracy that has been carefully planned and arranged. They tried to cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world, and have been strictly blocking the news; but the voice of justice cannot be blocked, and the heinous crimes of the right-wing reactionary forces have finally been completely exposed, and the truth has been revealed to the world.
    In the note, the Chinese Embassy demanded that the Indonesian government immediately release all detained overseas Chinese, severely punish the instigators and organizers of the atrocities, compensate the families of the deceased overseas Chinese, compensate the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese, and ensure the personal safety of the overseas Chinese. At the same time, the embassy demanded that the Indonesian government promptly respond to the Chinese Foreign Ministry's note of April 12 regarding the repatriation of overseas Chinese, and in accordance with the four reasonable demands therein, first assist the suffering overseas Chinese in Mema, who are in dire straits, to return to their motherland as soon as possible.

    我大使馆照会印度尼西亚外交部
    最强烈抗议印尼右派迫害残杀美玛华侨
    要求印度尼西亚政府立即释放全部尚被扣押华侨，迅速答复我外交部关于遣送华侨回国的照会，首先协助美玛受难华侨尽早返回祖国
    新华社二十七日讯　雅加达消息：中华人民共和国驻印度尼西亚大使馆二十五日照会印度尼西亚外交部，就印度尼西亚右派反动势力恶毒迫害和残杀西努沙登格拉省美玛县的华侨的法西斯排华暴行，向印度尼西亚政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会说，自从一九六六年一月中旬开始，印度尼西亚右派反动势力一直对美玛县的华侨进行种族主义的迫害，使他们的生命财产遭受严重损失。今年一月十一日晚十一时许，美玛县的军事当局以“保护”为名，逮捕了当地华侨赖燮鉴、黄贤忠、黄印章、黄柘榴、高哲玲等五人。与此同时，受军队指挥的大批反动暴徒，持刀执斧，破门而入，强迫居住在拉巴（美玛县属）的全部华侨离开住所，然后把他们的财产洗劫一空。次日晨三时许，这批暴徒赶往美玛，会同当地暴徒共计两千多人，使用刀斧棍棒等凶器，对当地的一百四十多户华侨进行了疯狂袭击。暴徒强行闯入华侨商店和住宅，逢人便打，把男女老幼悉数驱出屋外。当场有十五名华侨包括三名妇女被砍伤，打伤，遭到拳打脚踢或棍棒敲击的不计其数。华侨洪承才因伤重流血过多，急救无效而死亡，洪家增的婴孩因惊吓患病而死，吴善义的腹部被匕首刺穿，生命垂危，黄迪信头部被利刀所砍，手指被斩断，已成残废。华侨被赶出屋外后，军警以“保护安全”为由，用事先预备的车辆，强迫运载他们到拉巴监狱和县议会厅集中，当时华侨都只穿随身的衣服，其他衣物一概不许携带。十二日六时许，在军警的带领下，成群的暴徒又进入华侨商店和住宅，恣意抢劫、破坏，所有值钱商品，贵重陈设以及衣物、手表、金银首饰等都被抢掠干净，暴行一直延续到中午，当地政府又借“保护”之名，把华侨残存的物品和家具等运往拉巴足球场及议会前厅集中，当晚又再度遭到暴徒洗劫。同时，华侨的运输车辆被征用，仓库存货以及由泗水新办到的货物都被没收拍卖，至此美玛华侨的全部财物已荡然无存，连门窗也被撬走，一根铁钉也未留下。
    照会说，暴行接着又蔓延到美玛附近的村镇，沙巴华侨一百人，柯瑞华侨十余人，也都在财物被抢走后，相继在一月十四日和一月二十九日被押往美玛，同美玛华侨八百多人一起关在集中营里，他们竟被当作囚犯，失去了行动自由，并饱受非人待遇。例如拉巴监狱的三百多名难侨，被强迫挤在五间五米见方的小牢房，没有衣服换，不能冲凉，整天在半饥饿状态中，以致不少老人、妇女和婴孩受折磨患病。
    照会说，美玛当局为了掩盖它的滔天罪行，竟妄图对无辜的难侨进行政治陷害，通过“审讯”强迫他们承认莫须有的罪名，承认军警伙同暴徒的匪盗行径是“正当的”，对所受损失“自愿不提出赔偿要求”，并恣意挑拨华侨同祖国的关系，而在这一切阴谋都未得逞，非法关押这些华侨达一个多月以后，不得不予以释放时，还公然强迫华侨在当地五位一体和右派反动团体代表的“监誓”下，举行所谓“效忠宣誓仪式”。美玛地方当局千方百计地封锁暴行消息，从一月十二日起近两个月内，一直不许华侨外出，也不许外地华侨进入美玛，并威胁受难者：“如果把真情报告了中国大使馆，北京电台广播了，小心遭殃”。直至现在，尚有华侨黄贤忠、黄印章、黄柘榴、高哲玲、高哲水、傅顺宗等人仍被作为人质扣押。
    照会指出，印度尼西亚右派反动势力在美玛制造的种族主义暴行，是骇人听闻的。事实充分表明：这一罪行是美玛地方当局和武装部队伙同右派组织的暴徒干出来的，是经过周密策划和布置的一个大阴谋。他们企图一手遮尽天下人耳目，一直严密封锁消息；可是正义的呼声是封锁不住的，右派反动势力的滔天罪行终于彻底暴露了，事实真相已大白于天下。
    中国大使馆在照会中要求印度尼西亚政府立即释放全部尚被扣押的华侨，严惩暴行的主使人和组织者，抚恤死难华侨的家属，赔偿华侨所受的损失，保障华侨的人身安全。大使馆同时要求印度尼西亚政府迅速答复中国外交部四月十二日关于遣送华侨回国的照会，依照其中的四点合理要求，首先协助正在水深火热之中的美玛受难华侨尽早返回自己的祖国。
