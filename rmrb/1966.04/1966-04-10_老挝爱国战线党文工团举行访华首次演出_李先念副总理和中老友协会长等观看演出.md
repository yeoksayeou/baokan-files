    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 9th, the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe, known by the Lao people as the "revolutionary art troupe," held its first performance in China tonight at the Capital Theatre.
    Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, President of the Sino-Lao Friendship Association Lian Guan, Vice Minister of Culture Zhao Xinchu, Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Ren Yinglun, and others watched the performance. Also in attendance were Lao friends in Beijing, including Madame Quinim Pholsena.
    The Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe visited China in 1964. Tonight, on the stage in Beijing, they once again introduced the struggle and life of the Lao people through folk song and dance performances with national characteristics. The "Morning Glow Dance," "Red Lantern Dance," and mixed choir "Cartoon" enthusiastically praised the wise leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front and Prince Souphanouvong. The "Shield Dance," "Triumphant Dance," and "Harvest Celebration Dance" demonstrated the Lao people's resolute spirit of struggle against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and introduced the people in the Lao liberated areas building through self-reliance, as well as the close relationship between the army and the people in the liberated areas. Each of their performances won warm applause.
    The "Friendship Dance," praising the fighting friendship between the people of Laos and China, was also warmly welcomed by the audience. The Lao artists also sang Chinese songs in Chinese, such as "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," and "Chairman Mao's Radiance."
    An opening ceremony was held before the performance. Vice President of the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries Ren Yinglun and Head of the Lao Patriotic Front Art Troupe Khampha Phoumkong spoke at the opening ceremony.
    After the performance, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and others, amid warm applause, walked onto the stage, shook hands cordially with the Lao artists, and congratulated them on the success of their performance.
