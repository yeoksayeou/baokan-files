　　Xinhua News Agency, 17th dispatch: The Japanese newspaper *Yomiuri Shimbun* published a report on the 14th by one of its reporters, revealing the heavy losses and chaotic state of Saigon's Tan Son Nhut Airport when it was fiercely attacked by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army on the 13th.

　　An excerpt of the report is as follows:

　　On the morning of the 13th, the Viet Cong (referring to the South Vietnamese People's Armed Forces) infiltrated Saigon and shelled Tan Son Nhut Airport, causing a great shock. On that morning, the reporter rushed to Tan Son Nhut Airport, which had been heavily bombarded, and witnessed the devastating scene after the shelling.

　　Black smoke billowed in the vast airspace above the airport, and the bodies of huge C-47 transport planes were riddled with holes. F-100 fighter jets were also hit. American soldiers shouted "amazing" and "shocking" while desperately fighting the fire. The base houses 13,000 U.S. troops and is also regularly stationed by many South Vietnamese (puppet) troops. This base is the largest attack and supply base in South Vietnam, jointly used by civil aviation. Tanks, rocket launchers, landmines, and other weapons form a "wall of iron and steel" here. However, the Viet Cong's mortars and recoilless guns that attacked it were exceptionally accurate.

　　After the base was shelled, strict news censorship was immediately implemented. Reporters and photographers who arrived at the scene waited for half a day before being allowed inside. The blue sky above the base, contrasted with the thick smoke below, made the place seem like "daytime darkness."

　　Fire trucks and jeeps with machine guns raced frantically. The nose of a C-47 twin-engine transport plane was blown ten meters away. The burnt-out fuselage revealed large holes. Fragments of the aircraft were scattered about.

　　A four-engine C-121 transport plane was hit from above and exploded internally. Splintered pieces and paper flew out of the shattered fuselage. The huge tail of a four-engine C-123 transport plane was nowhere to be found, the wheels were hit, the fuselage was tilted to the left, and the wings fell directly to the ground. The rubber of the wheels, more than one meter in diameter, was blasted into scattered pieces, which were swept up by the wind and danced in the air. The fuselage had countless bullet holes, and the ground around the plane had countless bullet holes ten centimeters in diameter. Digging down, pieces of bombs were dug out. "This is an 82mm mortar shell!" an American soldier exclaimed in terror. There were also eight places on the runway with bomb craters.

　　The heart of the base, the control tower, the civil aviation take-off and landing point, and the gasoline depot behind the waiting hall were all bombed. One of the five gasoline depots was still on fire, and black smoke hung low over the base. When will it be extinguished? "That's hard to say!" an American soldier shook his head.

　　The barracks where the American and South Vietnamese (puppet) troops were sleeping were directly hit. There was still fresh blood on the beds.

　　"The losses are great!" the reporter said softly. An American soldier standing blankly nearby said, "Everyone is shocked." Usually, a bomber or jet fighter takes off every thirty seconds, but today not a single one has taken off. Needless to say, civil aviation has also stopped, and the U.S. military is urgently repairing the airport.

　　The Viet Cong attack began at 0:30 a.m. Colonel Ouns, the American officer in charge of the base at the time, said, "As soon as the attack began, I determined the intention and immediately notified my subordinates, ordering four majors to respond immediately. After the second attack, we immediately fired flares to respond. But the Viet Cong had already disappeared."

### 神炮显威力　机场成火海  日本记者报道新山一机场遭到南越解放军炮击后的狼狈相

    神炮显威力　机场成火海
    日本记者报道新山一机场遭到南越解放军炮击后的狼狈相
    新华社十七日讯　日本《读卖新闻》十四日刊登了这家报纸记者的一篇报道，透露了西贡新山一机场十三日遭到越南南方解放军猛烈袭击时损失惨重，陷入一片混乱的状态。
    这篇报道的摘要如下：
    十三日凌晨，越共（指南越人民武装）潜入西贡，炮击新山一机场，这是个很大的震动。记者在这一天早晨，赶到遭受猛烈炮轰的新山一机场，目击炮轰后的惨状。
    广大的机场上空冒着黑烟，庞大的C—47型运输机机身上，到处是洞穴。F—100战斗机也中了弹。美国军人一边大叫“厉害”、“震惊”，一边拼命救火。基地里单只美军就有一万三千人，另外还常驻着许多南越（伪）军。这个基地是与民航共同使用的、南越最大的攻击和补给基地。战车、火箭炮、地雷等等武器，在这里构成了“铜墙铁壁”。但是，进攻这里的越共的迫击炮和无后座力炮，打得异常准确。
    基地遭到炮轰后，马上实行了严密的新闻管制。赶到现场的记者和摄影记者等了半天才被准许入内。基地上的蓝蓝天空，衬着下面的处处浓烟，显得这地方有如“白昼的黑暗”。
    消防车、载有机关枪的吉普车拼命地奔驰。C—47型双引擎运输机的机头，被炸到十米以外。烧毁了的机身，露出个个大洞。机身碎片凌乱。
    四引擎的C—121运输机；从上部中弹，在内部爆炸。炸裂开的机身里，飞散着破片和纸张。四引擎的C—123运输机，巨大的尾翼不知飞到何处去了，机轮中弹，机身向左斜，翅膀一直跌在地面上。直径一米多的机轮，橡胶被炸成零星碎块，被风卷起来飞舞。机身有无数弹孔，飞机四周的土地上，有无数直径十厘米的弹穴。直挖下去，就挖出了炸弹碎片。“这是八二毫米口径迫击炮弹啊！”美国兵用恐怖的声音叫着。跑道上，也有八处地方露出弹坑。
    基地的心脏部分，指挥塔和民航机起落点、候机大厦后面的汽油库都遭炸。五个汽油库之一，还冒着火光，黑烟低罩在基地上。什么时候可以熄灭呢？“那可难说了！”美国兵摇头。
    美军、南越（伪）军正在睡觉的兵营，直接中弹。卧床上还有鲜血。
    “损失很大啊！”记者轻轻提了这么一句。在一旁呆立着的美国士兵说，“大家都震惊了。”平常每隔三十秒钟就有一架轰炸机、喷气战斗机起飞，今天连一架也没有出动。不用说，民航机也停止，美军正在急于修复机场。
    越共攻击是上午零时三十分开始的，当时在基地负责的美军奥恩斯上校说，“攻击一开始，我判明了意图以后，马上通知部下，命令四名少校立即应战。第二次进攻以后，我们立刻发射照明弹，进行应战。可是越共已经没有了踪影。”
