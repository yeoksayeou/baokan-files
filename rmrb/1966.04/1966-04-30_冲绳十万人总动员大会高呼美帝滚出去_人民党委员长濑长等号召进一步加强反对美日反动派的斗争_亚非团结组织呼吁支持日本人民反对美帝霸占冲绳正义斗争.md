    Okinawa Ten Thousand People's General Mobilization Rally Shouts "Yankee Go Home!"
    People's Party Chairman Senaga and Others Call for Further Strengthening the Struggle Against the US-Japan Reactionaries
    Afro-Asian Solidarity Organization Calls for Support for the Japanese People's Just Struggle Against US Imperialist Occupation of Okinawa
    (Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 29th) News: On "Okinawa Day" (April 28th), various mass rallies and demonstrations were held in Okinawa Prefecture, occupied by the US military, and in many places in mainland Japan, such as Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Fukuoka, demanding the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands and to drive the Americans out.
    On the evening of the 28th, approximately 100,000 people of Okinawa Island held a general mobilization rally in Naha City. The masses held up signs with slogans such as: "Return Okinawa to Japan," "US Imperialism get out of Okinawa, get out of Japan, get out of Asia." Chairman of the Okinawa Prefecture Return to the Fatherland Council, Kiyabu Shinei, and Chairman of the People's Party, Senaga Kamejiro, spoke at the rally. They demanded the return of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan and called on the people of Okinawa to unite with the people of mainland Japan to further strengthen the struggle against the US-Japan reactionaries. The rally passed a resolution demanding the return of Okinawa to Japan and condemning the US aggression against Vietnam.
    After the rally, the participants divided into two groups, shouting slogans, and held a demonstration march through the streets of Naha.
    On the morning of the same day, a maritime demonstration was also held on the sea near Okinawa. Approximately three thousand people participated in the rally on more than twenty ships.
    Japanese Communist Party Diet member Kato Susumu and Socialist Party Diet member Kawasaki Kanji spoke at the demonstration. They condemned US imperialism for illegally occupying Okinawa for twenty years and turning Okinawa into a base for its aggression against Vietnam and Asia. They also condemned the Sato government for serving the US's aggressive policies. The demonstration passed an appeal calling on the Japanese people to further develop the struggle.
    The Third Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference in 1963 passed a resolution designating April 28th of each year as "Okinawa Day" to show support for the Japanese people's struggle to recover Okinawa.
    (Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, 27th) The Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization issued a statement today on Okinawa Day (April 28th), calling on the people of all Afro-Asian countries to support the Japanese people's just struggle against US imperialism, demanding the recovery of Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands, and striving for thorough national liberation, democracy, and world peace.
    The statement said: "Today, US imperialism is concentrating its efforts on aggression in Asia. This is demonstrated by the escalating war of US imperialism's aggression against Vietnam, the rapid increase in US troops, military bases, and fleets in Asia, and, moreover, US imperialism is clamoring to implement a policy of 'containing China' and is repeatedly carrying out war provocations against China. Under these circumstances, it goes without saying that Okinawa's strategic significance to US imperialism has increased unprecedentedly." The statement said: "The legitimate demand to return Okinawa and the Ogasawara Islands to Japan should be realized immediately, all US military base facilities in Okinawa must be dismantled, all US troops must be withdrawn, and the US-Japan 'Security Treaty' must be abolished."

    冲绳十万人总动员大会高呼美帝滚出去
    人民党委员长濑长等号召进一步加强反对美日反动派的斗争
    亚非团结组织呼吁支持日本人民反对美帝霸占冲绳正义斗争
    据新华社二十九日讯东京消息：在“冲绳日”（四月二十八日），在美军占领下的冲绳县和在日本本土的东京、大阪、京都、福冈等许多地方，举行了各种群众大会和示威，要求收回冲绳和小笠原群岛，把美国佬赶出去。
    二十八日晚上，约有十万冲绳岛人民在那霸市举行了总动员大会。群众高举着标语牌，上面写着：“把冲绳归还日本”、“美帝国主义滚出冲绳去、滚出日本去、滚出亚洲去”。冲绳县重归祖国协议会主席喜屋武真荣、人民党委员长濑长龟次郎在大会上讲了话。他们要求把冲绳和小笠原群岛归还日本，号召冲绳人民同日本本土人民团结起来，进一步加强反对美日反动派的斗争。大会通过决议，要求把冲绳还给日本，并且谴责美国侵略越南。
    大会结束后，与会者分成两路，高呼口号，在那霸街上举行了示威游行。
    当天上午，还在冲绳附近的海面上举行了海上示威大会。大约三千人乘坐二十多只船参加了大会。
    日本共产党议员加藤进和社会党议员川崎宽治在示威大会上讲了话。他们谴责美帝国主义非法霸占冲绳二十年，并且把冲绳变成了它侵略越南和亚洲的一个基地。他们还谴责佐藤政府为美国的侵略政策效劳。示威大会上通过了一项呼吁书，号召日本人民进一步开展斗争。
    一九六三年第三届亚非团结大会通过决议，决定把每年四月二十八日定为“冲绳日”，表示支持日本人民收回冲绳的斗争。
    据新华社开罗二十七日电　亚非人民团结组织今日就冲绳日（二十八日）发表声明，号召所有的亚非国家人民支持日本人民反对美帝国主义、要求收复冲绳和小笠原群岛、争取彻底的民族解放、民主和世界和平的正义斗争。
    声明说：“今天美帝国主义正在集中力量侵略亚洲。说明这一点的是美帝国主义侵略越南的逐步升级的战争、迅速增加在亚洲的美军、军事基地和舰队，此外美帝国主义正在叫嚣要执行‘遏制中国’的政策，一再对中国进行战争挑衅。在这种情况下，不言而喻，冲绳对美帝国主义的战略意义是空前的增加了。”声明说：“把冲绳和小笠原群岛归还日本的正当要求应该立即实现，在冲绳的一切美国军事基地设施必须撤除，所有美国军队必须撤出，日美‘安全条约’必须废除。”
