    Unified Leadership and Division of Responsibility
    Editor's Note: Comrade Yao Xinghua has raised a very important issue, which is how to view the issue of unified leadership and division of responsibility. In many grassroots organizations of the Party, this issue has been well resolved, and some experience has been accumulated. However, many grassroots Party organizations have not yet resolved this issue well. We hope that comrades in Party organizations at all levels who are engaged in grassroots organizational work will express their opinions on this issue based on their own experiences and the practical problems they encounter in their work.
    Recently, I participated in a forum of a rural Party branch. At the meeting, everyone discussed some problems in the work of the branch. A branch committee member and the branch secretary argued with each other. They had the following dialogue:
    Branch Committee Member: "I think the branch secretary is busy enough. You have to manage this and you have to manage that. Does the branch secretary have to approve a slip of paper for the production team to buy a few boxes of batteries?"
    Branch Secretary: "There is a lot of work in a production team. As the head of the family, I naturally have to manage things."
    Branch Committee Member: "You manage too little of the affairs of the brigade, especially those important matters, such as implementing the Party's policies, checking the work of the branch committee members, deciding on the brigade's plans for increased production, Party building, and so on."
    Branch Secretary: "Because I'm too busy."
    Branch Committee Member: "Why do you manage fewer important things? It's because you feel there is no power in doing these things. Approving slips of paper and mediating marital disputes are power. These are of course power, but they are small powers. You only care about seizing small powers, so you don't have time to grasp unified leadership."
    Branch Secretary: "It's not that I want to do this! The commune also does it this way. Many business departments in the county also come to me, even though they should be looking for the brigade leader. I have to manage these things."
    I think this raises an important issue, which is how to view the issue of unified leadership. Our Party is the party of the proletariat, and of course, it must grasp the leadership of the proletariat, must lead everything, and can lead everything. The Party must manage its own self-construction, but also manage administrative work and production work. The question is how to manage it.
    Now, some comrades who do branch work are indeed only satisfied with seizing those small powers. Those small powers that were originally administrative powers have also been seized by the branch. On the surface, the branch has power. In reality, however, the branch has relaxed unified leadership, relaxed Party building, and relaxed the implementation of the Party's policies, and so on. As a result, it is not possible to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, especially the enthusiasm of the brigade cadres. The Party must lead everything, but in specific work, it must also be handled separately and not take over administrative affairs. This issue has not been well resolved in many commune party committees and brigade party branches. There are ideological issues and methodological issues here. I hope the newspaper can publicize this issue. Yao Xinghua

### 统一领导和分工负责

    统一领导和分工负责
    编者按：姚兴华同志提出了一个很重要的问题，这就是如何看待统一领导和分工负责的问题。在党的许多基层组织里，这个问题解决得好，积累了一些经验。也有不少基层党组织，还没有很好地解决这个问题。我们希望各级党组织做基层组织工作的同志，根据自己的切身体会，工作中碰到的实际问题，就这个问题发表意见。
    最近，我参加了一个农村党支部的座谈会。会上，大家讨论了支部工作中的一些问题。一个支部委员和支部书记争论起来，他们有这样一段对话：
    支部委员：“我觉得，支部书记的工作够忙了。这样也要管，那样也要管。大队买几盒电池，是否也要支部书记批条子？”
    支部书记：“一个生产大队，工作就是不少。当家人，自然要把事情管起来。”
    支部委员：“大队里的事情，特别是那些重大的事情，比如，贯彻党的方针政策呀，检查支部委员的工作呀，决定大队的增产大计呀，党的建设呀，等等，你管得太少了。”
    支部书记：“因为我太忙了呀。”
    支部委员：“为什么重要的事管少了呢？就是你觉得做这些事情没有什么权。那些批条子呀，调解夫妻吵架呀，才是权。这些当然是权，可是是些小权。你只顾去抓小权了，就没有功夫去抓统一领导了。”
    支部书记：“这并不是我要这样呀！公社也是这样抓法。县里许多业务部门，本来该找大队长的，也来抓我。我只好把这些事情管起来。”
    我想，这里提出了一个重要问题，那就是怎样看待统一领导的问题。我们党是无产阶级的党，当然要掌握无产阶级领导权，必须领导一切，也能够领导一切。党要管党的自身建设，也要管行政工作，管生产工作。问题在于怎么管法。
    现在，有些做支部工作的同志，的确是只满足于抓那些小权。那些本来是行政上的小权，支部也抓过来了。表面上看，支部是有权了。实际上，支部却放松了统一领导，放松了党的建设，放松了贯彻执行党的方针政策，等等。这样一来，也就不能充分发挥各方面的积极性，特别是大队干部的积极性。党要领导一切，但是，在具体工作上，又要分头去办，不要包揽行政事务。这个问题，在许多公社党委、大队党支部里，还没有很好解决。这里面有思想问题，也有方法问题。我希望报上能就这个问题宣传宣传。　姚兴华
