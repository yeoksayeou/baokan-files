    Mobilizing the Peasants' Initiative:
    To highlight politics, we must grasp the human factor. What is the "human factor"? What kind of initiative of people should be mobilized, socialist or capitalist? On this issue, I have had a process of understanding.
    Originally, I thought that grasping the human factor meant mobilizing the peasants' initiative in production. As for what kind of ideology to use to mobilize the peasants' initiative, my own thinking was not clear. For example, a few years ago, I mobilized the masses in a brigade to formulate a long-term plan. I told the commune members that by 1970, the total grain output of the entire brigade should reach so many catties, and the economic income should be so many yuan; by then, each person could distribute so much more grain and so much more cash than now. After I said this, the "initiative" of the commune members was indeed raised. At that time, we also put forward the slogan "Strive for (each person) to eat a thousand catties of grain," and the commune members were also very happy to hear it. At that time, I thought that doing so was mobilizing the positive factors of people, which was also "highlighting politics."
    Now, upon examination, that was not highlighting proletarian politics, but "highlighting economic indicators." Because we were not educating the peasants with socialist and communist ideas, using the idea of "farming for the revolution" to mobilize the peasants' enthusiasm for building a new socialist countryside; but simply taking the improvement of personal life as the goal, and guiding the peasants to strive for more grain and more money with individualistic ideas. In essence, this is highlighting bourgeois politics, not highlighting proletarian politics. Generally speaking, the economic status of peasants determines that under the leadership of the Communist Party, they can take the socialist road, but if political work is relaxed, capitalist spontaneous tendencies will flood. If we simply use personal interests, use so-called "economic indicators," it is easy to mobilize the "initiative" of their private psychology and lead them astray. Therefore, we must clearly realize that in daily production and life, we must always adhere to the socialist political direction, and use proletarian ideology to educate the peasants. This is a major measure to build socialism and prevent revisionism.
    Examining our past work from the perspective of highlighting proletarian politics, many of our previous tasks are very worthy of scrutiny. For example, in business management, emphasizing that the more detailed the quota, the more reasonable it is, engaging in sophistry, which resulted in guiding the peasants to haggle over personal gains and losses. After the political consciousness of the peasants in some places improved, they were very dissatisfied with our set of tedious quotas, and it did not work in practice. For example, mobilizing the masses to sell more surplus grain, we did not carry out education for the revolution, but only talked about how much the state supports agriculture, and we calculated the details, saying that production had increased, and if we did not sell more surplus grain, how could we be worthy of the state? This is essentially enlightening the peasants' "repayment" ideology, rather than enlightening their socialist consciousness and enthusiasm for building a socialist motherland.

### 调动农民的哪种积极性？

    调动农民的哪种积极性？
    突出政治，要抓人的因素。什么叫“人的因素”？要调动人的哪一种积极性，是社会主义的，还是资本主义的？在这个问题上，我有个认识过程。
    原来，我以为抓人的因素，就是去调动农民搞生产的积极性；至于用什么思想去调动农民的积极性，自己思想上并不明确。例如，前几年我在一个大队发动群众制订远景规划。我对社员们讲，到一九七○年，全大队粮食总产量要达到多少斤，经济收入多少元；到那时，每人可以比现在多分多少粮食，多分多少现钱。这样一讲，社员的“积极性”确实是提高了。当时，我们还提出“为（每人）吃千斤粮而奋斗”的口号，社员们听了也很高兴。那时，我以为这样做是把人的积极因素调动起来了，也就是“突出政治”了。
    现在检查起来，那样做不是突出无产阶级政治，而是“突出经济指标”。因为我们不是以社会主义、共产主义思想去教育农民，用“种田为革命”的思想去调动农民建设社会主义新农村的积极性；而是单纯以搞好个人生活为目标，以个人主义的思想去引导农民为多吃粮多分钱而奋斗。实质上这是突出资产阶级的政治，而不是突出无产阶级的政治。一般地说，农民的经济地位决定了他们在共产党的领导下，可以走社会主义道路，但是如果放松了政治工作，资本主义自发倾向就会泛滥起来。如果单纯用个人利益、用所谓“经济指标”，就很容易调动他们私有心理的“积极性”，把他们引向邪路。因此，我们要明确地认识到，在日常的生产和生活中，一定要时时处处坚持社会主义的政治方向，用无产阶级的思想教育农民。这是建成社会主义、防止修正主义的重大措施。
    用突出无产阶级政治的观点来检查，我们以往的许多工作是很值得推敲的。象在经营管理中，强调定额越细致才越合理，搞烦琐哲学，结果是引导农民斤斤计较个人的得失。有些地方的农民政治觉悟提高了，对我们搞的一套烦琐定额很不满意，而且在实际工作中也行不通。又比如，动员群众多卖余粮，我们不是进行为革命的教育，而是只讲国家支援农业很多东西，跟他们算细账，说增产了，如果要不多卖点余粮，怎能对得起国家？这实质上是启发农民的“报恩”思想，而不是启发他们的社会主义觉悟和建设社会主义祖国的积极性。
