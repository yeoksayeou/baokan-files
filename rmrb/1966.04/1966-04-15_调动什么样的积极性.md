　　Some leading cadres of the Production Materials Procurement and Supply Station in Hailun County, Heilongjiang Province, in the past, when mobilizing employees to rectify the warehouse, spoke of urging everyone to "fight for prestige" in order to welcome inspection teams and maintain the station's honor. As a result, the warehouse was not thoroughly rectified. In March of this year, they reorganized the warehouse again. They explained the significance of changing the appearance of the warehouse for maintaining goods and facilitating the selection of goods by grassroots units, and organized employees to study Chairman Mao's works to enhance their courage to overcome difficulties. Therefore, the employees were full of energy and rectified the warehouse with a completely new look.
　　When encountering problems, ideological work must be done to mobilize the enthusiasm of employees. However, if one only focuses on "fighting for prestige" and maintaining honor, the enthusiasm mobilized will be that of trophy-ism. In this way, not only can work not be truly done well, but it may also lead some people to develop bad habits of falsification. We do not want such enthusiasm; what we want is enthusiasm that is wholeheartedly for the revolution and everything for the revolution. Our ideological work can only focus on promoting people's ideological revolutionization. Different focus points will result in vastly different effects.

### 调动什么样的积极性

    调动什么样的积极性
    黑龙江省海伦县生产资料采购供应站的一些领导干部，过去在动员职工整顿仓库的时候，讲的是要大家“争口气”，是为了迎接检查团，保持站里的荣誉。结果，仓库并没有彻底整理好。今年三月份，又整顿仓库。他们说明了改变仓库面貌对养护好商品和便利基层选货的意义，并且组织职工学习毛主席著作，提高克服困难的勇气。因此，职工们干劲充沛，把仓库整顿得面貌一新。
    遇事要做思想工作，要调动职工的积极性。但是，如果只是着眼于“争口气”，保荣誉，调动的就会是锦标主义的积极性。这样，不仅不能真正做好工作，还可能使一些人产生弄虚作假的坏作风。我们不要这样的积极性，我们要的是一心为革命、一切为革命的积极性。我们的思想工作，只能着眼于促进人的思想革命化。着眼点不同，效果会迥然不同。
