    (Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd) A rally of 1,500 young people in the capital was held at the CPPCC Auditorium this afternoon to warmly welcome the delegation of the Vietnamese Labor Youth Union and commemorate the fifth anniversary of the founding of the South Vietnam Youth Liberation Federation.

    Hu Keshi, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, presided over the meeting and delivered the opening remarks. He said that the visit of the Vietnamese Labor Youth Union delegation to China will surely greatly inspire the Chinese youth's determination to overthrow U.S. imperialism and accelerate socialist construction, and strengthen the friendship between the youth of China and Vietnam.

    Hu Keshi warmly praised the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation. He expressed that the Chinese youth resolutely support the Vietnamese people and youth in carrying out the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation to the end.

    Li Wenyi, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Youth League, Vo Quang, head of the delegation of the Vietnamese Labor Youth Union and First Secretary of the Vietnamese Labor Youth Union, and Nguyen Minh Phuong, Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front to China, spoke at the meeting successively.

    Li Wenyi condemned the modern revisionists centered on the leaders of the CPSU for consistently cooperating with U.S. imperialism in engaging in "peace talks" conspiracies, vainly attempting to force the Vietnamese people to stop the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and to bring the Vietnam issue into the orbit of Soviet-U.S. cooperation.

    Head of Delegation Vo Quang said that the people and youth of Vietnam and China are closely united and fight side by side against the common enemy—U.S. imperialism. The sea may run dry and the rocks may crumble, but the friendship between the people and youth of Vietnam and China is unbreakable.

    Nguyen Minh Phuong said that the "peace negotiation" and "unconditional discussion" rhetoric spread by the United States cannot deceive anyone. He said that as long as U.S. imperialism lingers and refuses to leave, the army and people of South Vietnam will resolutely fight to the end, and U.S. imperialism and its running dogs will certainly not escape a shameful defeat.

    Hoang Bac, Counselor of the Vietnamese Embassy in China, was also invited to attend the meeting.

    The delegation of the Vietnamese Labor Youth Union arrived in Beijing on the 22nd.

    (Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd) The All-China Youth Federation sent a telegram to the South Vietnam Youth Liberation Federation on the 22nd, warmly congratulating the South Vietnam Youth Liberation Federation on its fifth anniversary, and on behalf of the Chinese youth, extended the highest respect to the heroic South Vietnamese youth fighting on the front lines of the anti-U.S. struggle.

    April 24th of this year is the fifth anniversary of the founding of the South Vietnam Youth Liberation Federation. The All-China Youth Federation's congratulatory telegram said that the South Vietnam Youth Liberation Federation, born and grown up in the flames of the national liberation struggle waged by the people of South Vietnam, under the leadership of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, has united the broad masses of youth in South Vietnam for the past five years, and has carried out successive and heroic and tenacious struggles against the heinous U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, and has achieved one brilliant victory after another, making significant contributions to the revolutionary cause of the Vietnamese people in liberating the South, defending the North, and unifying the motherland.

    The telegram concluded by saying that the Chinese youth resolutely support the Vietnamese people and youth's great struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation, and resolutely stand with the brothers and sisters of Vietnam, and fight to the end to completely defeat U.S. imperialism, the most vicious enemy of the world's people!

    首都青年集会欢迎越南劳动青年团代表团纪念南越青年解放联合会成立五周年
    中越两国青年紧密团结并肩反对美帝国主义
    据新华社二十三日讯　首都青年一千五百人今天下午在政协礼堂举行大会，热烈欢迎越南劳动青年团代表团，纪念越南南方青年解放联合会成立五周年。
    共青团中央书记处书记胡克实主持大会并致开会词。他说，越南劳动青年团代表团这次访问中国，必将有力地鼓舞中国青年打倒美帝国主义和加速社会主义建设的决心，加强中越两国青年的友谊。
    胡克实热烈赞扬越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的巨大胜利。他表示，中国青年坚决支持越南人民和青年把抗美救国斗争进行到底。
    共青团北京市委副书记李文义，越南劳动青年团代表团团长、越南劳动青年团第一书记武光和越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团副团长阮明芳，先后在大会上讲话。
    李文义谴责以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义者一直配合美帝国主义搞“和谈”阴谋，妄图迫使越南人民停止抗美救国斗争，把越南问题纳入苏美合作的轨道。
    武光团长说，越中两国人民和青年紧密团结，并肩反对共同敌人——美帝国主义。海可枯，石可烂，越中两国人民和青年的友谊是牢不可破的。
    阮明芳说，美国散布的“和平谈判”、“无条件讨论”等论调，是欺骗不了任何人的。他说，只要美帝国主义还赖着不走，越南南方军民就坚决抗战到底，美帝国主义和它的走狗一定逃脱不了可耻的失败。
    越南驻中国大使馆参赞黄北也应邀出席大会。
    越南劳动青年团代表团是二十二日到京的。
    据新华社二十三日讯　中华全国青年联合会二十二日打电报给越南南方青年解放联合会，热烈祝贺越南南方青年解放联合会成立五周年，并代表中国青年向英勇战斗在反美斗争最前线的兄弟的越南南方青年致最崇高的敬意。
    今年四月二十四日，是越南南方青年解放联合会成立五周年。全国青联的贺电中说，在越南南方人民进行的民族解放斗争的烈火中诞生和成长起来的越南南方青年解放联合会，在越南南方民族解放阵线的领导下，五年来，团结越南南方的广大青年，同万恶的美帝国主义及其走狗进行着前赴后继、英勇顽强的斗争，取得了一个接着一个的辉煌胜利，为越南人民解放南方、保卫北方、统一祖国的革命事业作出了重大的贡献。
    电文最后说，中国青年坚决支持越南人民和青年的伟大的抗美救国斗争，坚决和越南的兄弟姐妹们站在一起，为彻底打败世界人民最凶恶的敌人美帝国主义而斗争到底！
