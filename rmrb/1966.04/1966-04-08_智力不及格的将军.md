    A General Who Failed Intelligence Tests
    Feng Lin
    The increasing number of American invading troops killed and wounded on the South Vietnamese battlefield has become a headache for Washington. According to a recent report in the American magazine *Newsweek*, a high-ranking American official confided to reporters that Johnson was very depressed by the "many coffins being shipped back (from South Vietnam)."
    What to do? Westmoreland, the head of the American invading forces in South Vietnam, recently announced that he has come up with a "brilliant plan" to reduce American casualties. It is said that according to this commander-in-chief's "calculation scale," if the United States doubles its current 200,000+ troops in South Vietnam, American casualties can be "reduced by one-third." If the troops are increased by two times, the casualties can be "reduced by one-half."
    Westmoreland considers himself very clever. By simply manipulating a magic wand-like "calculation scale," he can both find a new excuse for the United States to further increase its troops in South Vietnam and avoid intensifying popular opposition. It seems that Johnson can also stop worrying about the large number of coffins being shipped back from South Vietnam.
    Westmoreland is so capable! No wonder Johnson praised him as an "outstanding general."
    However, whether Westmoreland's "brilliant plan" is effective can be determined by simply looking at the facts on the South Vietnamese battlefield. Since last year, haven't the American invading forces sent to South Vietnam increased several times over? As a result, the number of American casualties has not decreased, but increased. For example, in the first half of last year, the American forces in South Vietnam were only a quarter of their current size, and the average monthly American casualties were 501; in November of last year, the American forces increased to three-quarters of their current size, and the average monthly casualties reached 5,300; and since the beginning of this year, the American casualty rate has continued to rise unabated. Even American newspapers cannot conceal this fact. Although they try their best to greatly reduce the actual figures of American casualties, they have to admit that with the "gradual escalation" of the American war in South Vietnam, American casualties are also increasing step by step. This shows that the "brilliant plan" proposed by Westmoreland will not reduce the casualties of the American invading forces in Vietnam, but will only increase the number of coffins that the United States ships back from South Vietnam.
    Imperialists and reactionaries not only need to deceive others, but also need to deceive themselves, otherwise they cannot survive. It is of course not surprising that Westmoreland wants to use some self-deceiving methods regarding the issue of American casualties in Vietnam. However, he actually describes a method that can only increase coffins as a brilliant plan to reduce casualties, and even triumphantly brags that he has created some kind of "calculation scale." This not only shows the plight of the American aggressors in South Vietnam being at their wit's end, but also shows the stupidity of this "outstanding general" to what a ridiculous extent.
    Not long ago, in order to collect cannon fodder, the American government conscripted some people who failed intelligence tests into the army. At the time, some American newspapers had some criticisms. It seems that these criticisms are completely superfluous. Because even the head of the American invading forces in Vietnam, the dignified General Westmoreland, is a role who fails intelligence tests, unable to even calculate addition and subtraction, direct and inverse proportions!

    智力不及格的将军
    烽林
    美国侵略军在南越战场上死伤人数大量增加，这已经成为一件使华盛顿伤透脑筋的事情。据美国《新闻周刊》不久前报道，一个美国高级官员向记者吐露说：约翰逊对于有“这么多棺材（从南越）运回来”感到十分忧郁。
    怎么办呢？美国驻南越的侵略军头子威斯特摩兰最近宣布，他已经想出了一个减少美军伤亡的“妙策”。据说，按照这位总司令的“计算标尺”，如果美国把目前在南越的二十多万军队增加一倍，美军的伤亡就可以“减少三分之一”。把军队增加二倍，伤亡就可以“减少二分之一”。
    威斯特摩兰自以为很聪明，只要摆弄一根魔棍般的“计算标尺”，就既能替美国进一步增兵南越找到一个新的借口，又能不致加剧人民的反对情绪，约翰逊也似乎可以不再为从南越运回来的棺材太多而发愁了。
    威斯特摩兰多有能耐啊，怪不得约翰逊要誉之为“出色的将军”了。
    但是，威斯特摩兰的“妙策”是否有效，只要看一看南越战场上的事实，就可以断言了。去年以来，美国派到南越的侵略军不是已经翻了好几番吗？结果，美军的死伤人数不是下降了，而是增加了。例如，去年上半年，美国在南越的兵力只有目前的四分之一，美军每月伤亡的平均数是五百零一人；去年十一月，美军增到目前兵力的四分之三，每月伤亡的平均数就到达五千三百人；而今年以来，美军伤亡率仍在有增无已地上升。甚至美国报刊也不能掩饰这一点。虽然它们尽量把美军伤亡的实际数字大大缩小，可是也不得不承认随着美国在南越战争的“逐步升级”，美军的伤亡也在拾级而上。这就表明，威斯特摩兰提出的“妙策”，决不会使侵越美军的伤亡减少，而只能使美国从南越运回的棺材越来越多。
    帝国主义和反动派不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。威斯特摩兰要在侵越美军的伤亡问题上耍一些自欺欺人的手法，这当然不足为怪。但是，他居然把一个只能使棺材增加的办法说成是减少伤亡的妙策，甚至得意洋洋地吹嘘自己创造了什么“计算标尺”，这不仅表明了美国侵略者在南越战场上黔驴技穷的窘态，而且也表明了这个“出色的将军”的愚蠢到了何等可笑的地步。
    不久前，美国政府为了搜罗炮灰，把一些智力不及格的人征去当兵。当时，某些美国报纸颇有一些非议。看来，这些议论完全是多余的。因为，连侵越美军的头子、堂堂的威斯特摩兰将军，也就是一个连增加和减少、正比和反比都计算不清楚的智力不及格的角色！
