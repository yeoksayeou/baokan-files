    Politics is the struggle of class against class. To observe things, analyze problems, expose contradictions, and handle work from this perspective, to take the interests of the proletariat as the standard in everything, and to never forget the struggle of promoting the proletariat and eliminating capitalism—this is highlighting politics. The personal experiences of the comrades of the Jiaocheng and Zhangjiachuan County Committees specifically illustrate this point.
    However, where is the class struggle specifically manifested? The leading comrades of these two counties were relatively unclear about this at one time. If class struggle cannot be grasped, it is impossible to highlight politics in work. They did not conduct class analysis of many problems that arose in production in the past, but simply focused on production for the sake of production. As a result, they could only treat the symptoms but not the disease, and could not solve the problems fundamentally. Regarding the unhealthy tendencies and evil practices that temporarily appeared in individual communes and production teams, and the failure to increase production, they did not discover that class enemies were stirring up trouble. They only tried to stabilize the masses' production mood with life care. As a result, production still did not increase. All these examples show that without seeing class struggle, it is impossible to grasp the "key link" in work.
    The comrades of Jiaocheng and Zhangjiachuan counties have gradually improved their understanding through their own practice. They said that they used to stand not high enough and could not see far enough. Now, using the method of "looking back and finding the root of the problem," after summarizing their work, they have begun to be able to see problems from the perspective of class struggle, and many things have become very clear. Once class struggle is grasped, it works effectively, and the problems are solved relatively smoothly.
    Now, some of our comrades see how the county committee highlights politics and promotes production through revolution as somewhat mysterious. They cannot connect revolution and production. The experiences of the Jiaocheng and Zhangjiachuan County Committees both tell us that as long as we learn to use the method of class analysis to dissect various problems and analyze various contradictions, we can see the specific content and specific manifestations of class struggle in our own work scope, in our region, and in our department. Highlighting politics will no longer be a mysterious thing, but something that can be grasped.

### 学会阶级分析的方法

    学会阶级分析的方法
    政治，就是阶级对阶级的斗争。用这样的观点来观察事物，分析问题，揭露矛盾，处理工作，一切以无产阶级利益为准绳，时刻不忘兴无灭资的斗争，就是突出政治。交城和张家川两个县委同志的亲身体验，具体说明了这一点。
    但是，阶级斗争具体表现在哪里？这两个县的领导同志，有一个时期认识是比较模糊的。阶级斗争抓不住，工作中就无法突出政治。他们对生产中出现的许多问题，以前没有进行阶级分析，而是简单地就生产抓生产，结果，只能是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，不能从根本上解决问题。对于个别社队一时出现的歪风邪气，生产上不去，他们没有发现阶级敌人在煽风点火，只是试图以生活上的照顾去稳定群众生产情绪，结果，生产还是上不去。所有这些事例，都说明了看不到阶级斗争，工作中就抓不到“纲”。
    交城和张家川两县的同志，通过自己的实践，认识逐步提高了。他们说，过去站得不高，看得不远，现在用“回头看，查病根”的办法，经过总结工作，开始能从阶级斗争的角度看问题，许多事就看得一清二楚了。阶级斗争一抓就灵，问题就比较顺利地解决了。
    现在，我们有些同志，对于县委怎样突出政治，怎样抓革命促生产，看得有些玄妙，对于革命和生产，总联系不起来。交城和张家川县委的经验都告诉我们，只要学会运用阶级分析的方法，解剖各种问题，分析种种矛盾，就能看到在自己的工作范围内、在本地区、在本部门内阶级斗争的具体内容和具体表现，突出政治就不再是什么玄妙的事，而是可以抓得住的了。
