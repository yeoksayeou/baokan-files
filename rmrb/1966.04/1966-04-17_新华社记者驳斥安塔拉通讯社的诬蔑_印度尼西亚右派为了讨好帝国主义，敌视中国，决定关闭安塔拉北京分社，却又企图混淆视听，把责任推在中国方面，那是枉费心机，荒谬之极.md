    Xinhua News Agency, April 16th dispatch: Xinhua News Agency reporter's commentary: Refuting Antara News Agency's slander against the Chinese press and Xinhua News Agency, the text is as follows:
    Antara News Agency issued a message from Jakarta on April 11th, saying that because Chinese newspapers stopped subscribing to the news releases published by the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch, and Xinhua News Agency stopped providing the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch with Morse broadcasts from Antara News Agency headquarters, Nur Nasution, the person in charge of Antara National News Agency, decided to close the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch. Antara News Agency attempted to confuse the public and slander and defame Xinhua News Agency and the Chinese press with untenable excuses, which is extremely absurd.
    Xinhua News Agency and Antara News Agency have never signed an agreement to provide each other's branches with news broadcasts from their respective headquarters. Xinhua News Agency has no obligation to provide the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch with broadcasts from Antara News Agency headquarters. As for whether the Chinese press subscribes to the news releases published by the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch, that is the freedom of the Chinese press, and no one has the right to interfere. Now that Antara News Agency has been reduced to a despicable tool of right-wing reactionary forces, and its news releases are full of anti-China slanders, how can the Chinese press spend money to subscribe to such dirty waste paper? Antara News Agency publishes vicious anti-China slanders every day, and still insists that the Chinese press pay to buy it. How can there be such an absurd thing in the world?
    Based on the desire to strengthen the friendly relations between the Chinese and Indonesian people, the Chinese press and Xinhua News Agency have provided a great deal of assistance and convenience to the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch in the past. For nearly eight years, Xinhua News Agency has unilaterally and gratuitously provided the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch with the broadcasts from Antara News Agency headquarters that it had copied. This shows that Xinhua News Agency has shown great goodwill to Antara News Agency in order to strengthen the friendship between the two news agencies in the struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism.
    However, since last October, the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have carried out a frantic persecution of the Xinhua News Agency's Jakarta branch, even dispatching troops and organizing thugs to attack the Xinhua branch, and finally unreasonably closed the Xinhua branch. Despite the fact that the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have taken these measures that seriously deteriorated the friendly relations between the people of the two countries and between the two news agencies, the Chinese side has not taken corresponding actions. The reporters of the Antara News Agency's Beijing branch still enjoy the same working conveniences as other foreign reporters stationed in Beijing. The Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces decided to close the Antara Beijing branch in order to please imperialism and new and old colonialism and to oppose China, which is their freedom; however, they want to take the opportunity to make false countercharges and shift the responsibility to the Chinese side, which is only a futile attempt and self-exposure.
    At present, the relations between China and Indonesia have been severely damaged by the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces. However, we firmly believe that the friendship between the people of China and Indonesia and between the progressive journalists of the two countries cannot be destroyed by any reactionary force. The people of China and Indonesia and the progressive journalists of the two countries will surely unite in the common struggle against imperialism and new and old colonialism and shatter all conspiracies to undermine the great friendship between the people of our two countries.

    新华社记者驳斥安塔拉通讯社的诬蔑
    印度尼西亚右派为了讨好帝国主义，敌视中国，决定关闭安塔拉北京分社，却又企图混淆视听，把责任推在中国方面，那是枉费心机，荒谬之极
    新华社十六日讯　新华社记者评论：驳安塔拉通讯社对中国报界和新华通讯社的诬蔑，文如下：
    安塔拉通讯社四月十一日从雅加达发了一条消息，说什么由于中国各报停止订阅安塔拉通讯社北京分社出版的新闻稿和新华通讯社停止对安塔拉通讯社北京分社提供安塔拉通讯社总社的摩尔斯广播稿，安塔拉国家通讯社掌权者努尔·纳苏蒂温决定关闭安塔拉通讯社北京分社。安塔拉通讯社企图混淆视听，用根本不能成立的借口对新华社和中国报界进行诬蔑和诽谤，实在是荒谬之极。
    新华社和安塔拉通讯社之间从来没有签订过相互向对方分社提供其总社新闻广播稿的协议。新华社没有任何义务要向安塔拉通讯社北京分社提供安塔拉通讯社总社的广播稿。至于中国报界是否订阅安塔拉通讯社北京分社出版的新闻稿，那是中国报界的自由，别人无权干预。在安塔拉通讯社已经沦为右派反动势力的卑劣工具，它的新闻稿上充满反华谰言的情况下，中国报界怎么能出钱订阅这种肮脏的废纸呢？安塔拉通讯社天天在发表恶毒的反华诬蔑，还硬要中国报界出钱购买它，天下岂有这样荒唐的事？
    中国报界和新华通讯社本着加强中国人民同印度尼西亚人民之间友好关系的愿望，过去在工作上对安塔拉通讯社北京分社提供了大量的帮助和方便。在过去将近八年的时间里，新华社曾单方面地、无偿地向安塔拉通讯社北京分社提供了抄收下来的安塔拉通讯社总社的广播稿，这说明新华社为了加强两国通讯社在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争中的友谊，对安塔拉通讯社表现了莫大的善意。
    但是，自从去年十月以来，印度尼西亚右派反动势力对新华社雅加达分社进行了疯狂的迫害，甚至出动军队，组织暴徒，袭击新华分社，最后竟无理封闭了新华分社。尽管印度尼西亚右派反动势力采取了这些严重恶化两国人民之间和两国通讯社之间友好关系的措施，中国方面并没有采取相应的行动。安塔拉通讯社北京分社的记者仍然享有同驻北京的其他外国记者同样的工作方便。印度尼西亚右派反动势力为了讨好帝国主义和新老殖民主义，敌视中国，决定关闭安塔拉北京分社，那是他们的自由；但是，他们要乘机倒打一耙，把责任推在中国方面，只是枉费心机、自我暴露而已。
    目前，中国同印度尼西亚的关系，受到了印度尼西亚右派反动势力极其严重的破坏。但是，我们坚信，中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间和两国进步新闻工作者之间的友谊，是任何反动势力也破坏不了的。中国同印度尼西亚两国人民和两国进步新闻工作者必将在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的共同斗争中团结起来，粉碎一切破坏我们两国人民之间伟大友谊的阴谋。
