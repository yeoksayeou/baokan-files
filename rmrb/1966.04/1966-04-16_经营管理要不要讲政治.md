	Should business management emphasize politics? Of course, there are political issues in business management. But why haven't we seriously highlighted politics in the past? This is mainly because our cadres, including leading cadres, are not armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and their ideology of serving the people and their class viewpoint are far from adequate.
	Take labor management as an example. Some communes and teams divide labor processes too finely and set labor quotas that are too cumbersome, causing some commune members to haggle over personal gains and losses. In fact, it is also difficult to implement. Individual grassroots cadres also take advantage of loopholes, reserving easy work with high work points for themselves. In some places, cadres are not clear about the direction of socialist agriculture, fearing trouble and seeking convenience, using the excuse of strengthening the responsibility system to engage in too much individual piecework, or even contracting work to households, which affects the consolidation and development of the collective economy. Some communes and teams one-sidedly emphasize payment according to labor and more pay for more work, neglecting the care for poor households and those guaranteed by the "Five Guarantees," and not seriously implementing the class line. Some simply engage in material incentives and "work points in command," fostering the selfish mentality of some commune members, and the collective spirit cannot be promoted. These phenomena fully demonstrate that there is a strong political nature in business management.
	Not long ago, the county party committee organized cadres to study Chairman Mao's works, debated the relationship between "politics and production" and "politics and business," and criticized the tendency of not asking about politics in business management, so that the broad masses of cadres realized that there are sharp and complex class struggles and two-road struggles in the business management of communes and teams. A serious task is to make all work conducive to the consolidation and development of the socialist collective economy, and to make all systems and methods conform to the interests of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants.

### 经营管理要不要讲政治

    经营管理要不要讲政治
    在经营管理中有没有政治问题？当然有。但为什么过去没有认真突出政治？这主要是我们干部，包括领导干部在内，没有用毛泽东思想武装头脑，为人民服务的思想还很不够，阶级观点还很不明确。
    就拿劳动管理来说吧，有些社、队把劳动工序分得过细，劳动定额过于烦琐，搞得一些社员斤斤计较个人得失，实际上也很难执行得通，个别基层干部还钻空子，把活路轻、工分高的活留给自己做。有些地方，干部对社会主义农业的方向不明确，干活怕麻烦、图省事，借口加强责任制，过多的搞个人计件，甚至包工到户，影响了集体经济的巩固和发展。有的社队片面强调按劳付酬、多劳多得，忽视了对贫困户、五保户的照顾，没有认真贯彻阶级路线。有的单纯搞物质刺激，工分挂帅，助长了某些社员的自私心理，集体主义思想得不到发扬。这些现象都充分说明，在经营管理中有很强的政治性。
    不久前，县委组织干部学习毛主席著作，对“政治和生产”“政治和业务”的关系展开辩论，对经营管理中不问政治的倾向进行了批判，使广大干部认识到：社队的经营管理工作中，存在着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争和两条道路斗争。一项严重的任务是，必须使一切工作有利于社会主义集体经济的巩固和发展，使一切制度和办法，符合广大贫下中农的利益。
