    Review of Wu Han's "Collection of Javelins" 		Shi Shaobin
    In June and July 1959, at the same time as the publication of Wu Han's "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," he also compiled his essays written in the 1940s into a "Collection of Javelins" for publication.
    Why did Wu Han choose to throw out these old goods on the eve of the Lushan Conference and name it "Collection of Javelins"? In the "Preface," he said: "We did think that way, said that way, scolded that way, and struggled that way back then. This period of history is worth recalling and is still worth referring to for the younger generation." In "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," he praised Hai Rui's brave spirit of daring to "scold"; here, he recommended himself, asking people to "recall" and "refer" to his own "glorious history" of "scolding" and "struggling," and transformed this spirit of "scolding" into his own "gun," then declared: "If you have a gun, you have to use it. What to do? Can't put it away, how about throwing it? Never mind three sevens twenty-one, if it hits, it will hurt a little..." So, he named this collection of essays "Collection of Javelins."
    We must carefully examine, what kind of gun were those essays written by Wu Han in the 1940s? Who were they thrown at at that time? Who was he throwing them at when he took them out in 1959?
      A Political Swindle
    For a long time, Wu Han has boasted about his so-called "revolutionary" history in the 1940s. This is his main political capital for swindling and opposing the Party and the people.
    In fact, the "revolutionary" history he boasts about is a complete fabrication!
    Since liberation, Wu Han has begun to fabricate his history in the 1940s. With the gradual deepening of the socialist revolution, in order to adapt to his political aim of opposing the Party and socialism, his fabrication of his history has also gradually "upgraded," and a series of myths have become increasingly bizarre. Now, Wu Han has dressed himself up as a "hero" of the democratic revolution era.
    Let us arrange a timeline of Wu Han's fabrication of history:
    In May 1949, he wrote "How Did My Learning and Thinking Progress?"①, which contains a passage that is quite worth savoring:
    "When I was studying at Tsinghua University, I shut myself in the research room for months and years. When I was teaching, because I hated the corruption of the Kuomintang, I was unwilling to contact politics, and I concentrated on academic research. When I arrived in Kunming in 1937, I still held this attitude. But since 1940, the Kuomintang's rule has become worse and worse, the Xianggui campaign was a complete defeat, coupled with malignant inflation, my own life also became more and more difficult like ordinary people, so my attitude towards the Kuomintang changed from dislike to hatred." How beautiful the words, "disliked" the Kuomintang in the 1930s, and since the 1940s, changed from "dislike" to "hatred."
    However, the facts prove that Wu Han's "concentrating on academic research" in the 1930s was not a manifestation of "disliking the Kuomintang," but a manifestation of faithfully implementing Hu Shi's reactionary line of "science saving the country" for the Kuomintang.
    However, just after liberation, Wu Han's courage to fabricate history was not as great as it was later, and he still revealed a little real news. For example, some of his changes in attitude towards the Kuomintang mainly occurred after the Xianggui campaign, that is, after 1944; the reason was that "life also became more and more difficult like ordinary people," and he could no longer maintain the difference from "ordinary people," and could no longer "live in comfort." At this time, he did not dare to greatly exaggerate how much he "hated" the Kuomintang.
    By January 1950, Wu Han had taken a big step up in his article "I Overcame the 'Super-Class' Viewpoint"②. He said:
    "In terms of action, I have been following the progressive forces for the past ten years, and I have not been stingy with myself at critical moments." Since then, he has dressed himself up as a "hero" who has "not been stingy with himself" for the revolution. And in the article, he shamelessly said how "I and Yiduo" were doing, comparing himself with Wen Yiduo and extracting political capital from the martyr.
    In July 1959, in the "Preface" written by Wu Han for "Collection of Javelins," he went even further, forcibly squeezing himself into the ranks of revolutionary martyrs such as Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu, saying that his articles at that time stung the Kuomintang, "If it didn't hurt, how could they kill even people like Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo?"
    We want to ask Wu Han: Where were you when Wen Yiduo and Li Gongpu fought resolutely against the Kuomintang reactionaries and sacrificed heroically? What were you doing?
    "Wen Yiduo slammed the table and stood up, glaring angrily at the Kuomintang's guns, preferring to fall rather than submit."③ And you? When you were asked to stay with Wen Yiduo, you took a plane to pursue your own "bright future." Is this called "not being stingy with oneself at critical moments"? Such Wu Han actually puts himself side by side with revolutionary martyrs, truly not knowing the meaning of shame!
    By December 1965, in order to resist criticism and launch a counterattack, Wu Han said in "Self-Criticism on "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"④ that he "has been standing firm on the class position politically under the education, cultivation, and care of the Party for more than 20 years." In this way, a political speculator has transformed himself into a firm proletarian revolutionary hero who has stood firm for more than 20 years!
    In the above series of records of historical fabrication, what we should pay most attention to is the "Collection of Javelins" published by Wu Han in 1959 at the same time as the publication of "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor." The dozens of essays collected in "Collection of Javelins" are permeated with a reactionary bourgeois stance. Wu Han wanted to use these bourgeois black goods to directly cooperate with the offensive of the right-leaning opportunists and throw them at socialism. However, if the original appearance of these dozens of essays were fully revealed, it would expose his progressive mask that he has been disguising for many years. If he wants to "throw javelins" and whitewash his history, "what to do"? So, Wu Han pondered hard and painstakingly created a political swindle.
    Swindle one: Wu Han said, "Revisiting these articles, they are mostly scolding the Kuomintang." He said this in an attempt to dispel people's doubts and make people not doubt their authenticity. Not only that, to put it bluntly, this is to use the words of scolding the Kuomintang to scold the Communist Party and the proletarian dictatorship.
    Swindle two: Wu Han said, "Under the circumstances at that time, only the Kuomintang and the Communist Party could be mentioned together in writing. Although the tone was different and the central argument was different, in terms of wording, it could only be said this way. It could not be published otherwise." Since there is a clear anti-communist tone in the book, it is impossible to make people not have any doubts. Wu Han also excused himself on the "circumstances at that time." That is to say, "the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are mentioned together" because there are unavoidable difficulties. Scolding the Communist Party is because "it can only be said this way, it cannot be published otherwise." In order to be able to scold the Kuomintang, the Communist Party had to be executed along with it! The blame lies on the environment, not on him! Wu Han openly took out his words of scolding the Communist Party again using this method. Is this not opposing the Party and opposing socialism?
    Swindle three: Wu Han said, "The articles collected in this collection, except for some minor modifications in the wording in individual places, such as changing the Qing Dynasty uniformly to the Qing Dynasty—there is basically no modification." Wu Han solemnly declared that these articles "basically have no modification"; if "today's views are used to replace the views of more than ten years ago," it would be "fraud and malfeasance," "Why bother, and why is it necessary?" This is his last move, a political swindler's method. He thought that since he had made such a statement, others would not think that this "scholar" who claimed to respect "historical facts" would tamper with the articles and erase a pile of reactionary things that could not be exposed to the light of day!
    Compared with the articles originally published, there are many major deletions and alterations in the "Collection of Javelins" published in 1959, which changed many blatant anti-communist and counter-revolutionary things, not just individual changes such as "Manchu Qing" being changed to "Qing Dynasty," let alone "basically no modification." —How exactly Wu Han tampered with the original text has great mysteries. We spare no effort to make a collation table, attached to the end of the article, which can also be regarded as "appreciating strange articles together"!
    Swindles are difficult to sustain, and lies cannot cover up facts.
    Below, let us peel off the mask of "Collection of Javelins" and see Wu Han's true face.
    Wu Han Submits "Security Proposals" to the Kuomintang Three Times
    "Collection of Javelins" does not include articles before 1943, which is not accidental. Wu Han himself also felt that before 1943, he was wholeheartedly devoted to the Kuomintang, without any "fire" or "spiciness," and could not produce anything that pretended to "scold the Kuomintang." How Wu Han went from not scolding to scolding, and what kind of scolding the so-called "scolding" was, the three articles "On Scholars," "On Corruption," and "Historical Lessons Three Hundred Years Ago" written in 1943 and 1944 outlined his face.
    In 1943, Wu Han published an article "On Corruption" in the Kuomintang's official newspaper "Yunnan Daily." If we compare this article with Hai Rui's "Security Proposal" that Wu Han boasted about in 1959, we will find very interesting "coincidences."
    In the "Security Proposal," Hai Rui listed the "unruly and uneasy" situations at that time as: "Officials are greedy, generals are weak, the people are not living, droughts and floods are untimely, and thieves are rampant." Wu Han said that the phenomenon of "internal affairs not being repaired" at that time was: "Politics comes from many sources, institutions are bloated, there is heavy taxation, laws are abundant, favorites are used, the people are helpless, currency is chaotic, thieves are rampant, droughts and floods are disasters, etc.," "and the most common and traditional phenomenon is corruption."
    Hai Rui confessed to Emperor Jiajing that his purpose in submitting the "Security Proposal" was to "seek eternal security" for the Ming Dynasty. Wu Han confessed to the Chiang Kai-shek group that the reason why he wrote "On Corruption" was to "turn over old accounts, look at the reasons for the demise of past dynasties, and then, in light of the current situation, seek out medicines that can treat the symptoms, which may be of some small help to the great cause of construction," that is, to help Chiang Kai-shek summarize the experience and lessons of rule so that he could avoid "demise."
    Of course, Hai Rui was a feudal bureaucrat four hundred years ago. The plan he proposed to Emperor Jiajing could only be "rectifying the emperor's way and clarifying the ministers' duties," and in the end, it was still maintaining the feudal discipline. However, the modern Wu Han designed a blueprint for Chiang Kai-shek to solve social problems: "Liberating 'people' from the shackles of the family... changing the social organization from family-based to individual-based." In other words, Wu Han hoped that Chiang Kai-shek would repair internal affairs, implement some capitalist reforms, and seek "eternal security" for the Chiang family dynasty, so that he could "crawl under the table and wait to gnaw on bones." This is the modern Hai Rui's "rectifying the emperor's way and clarifying the ministers' duties."
    In the article "On Scholars," Wu Han quoted "historical facts," ranging from the Spring and Autumn Period to modern times, repeatedly explaining the important role of "scholars" (intellectuals) to the ruling class. He said that scholars were "the only driving force for maintaining governance for the upper-class aristocratic class. If kings, feudal lords, and high officials could not get the support of scholars, not only would the regime collapse immediately, but even their lives and property could not be protected." He represented a group of bourgeois intellectuals who wanted to find a way out from the Chiang family dynasty and appealed to the "upper-class aristocratic class" at that time—the Chiang Kai-shek group: "To improve the social status of scholars," and said, "This is a topic that the whole country should devote all its efforts to in the future." This is the second "security proposal" that Wu Han submitted to Chiang Kai-shek.
    However, Chiang Kai-shek, this oligarchical dictator, did not even want a small piece of "democratic cloth," and did not appreciate Wu Han's "security proposal." Wu Han's material life also deteriorated, and his professor's "status was long gone," and there was no difference from "ordinary people." So, Wu Han started to scold people a little.
    However, Wu Han did not give up. Whenever he had the opportunity, he would offer advice to Chiang Kai-shek, hoping to be reused. In 1944, he submitted "security proposals" for the third time and threw out his "Historical Lessons Three Hundred Years Ago" in the Kuomintang's official newspaper "Justice Daily."
    The article begins by saying, "History is a mirror. There are too many things worth remembering three hundred years ago." The ending says, "Three hundred years later, we think about the situation three hundred years ago. The lessons are not far away, in the era of the Xiahou clan." Wu Han emphasized this point repeatedly, for fear that Chiang Kai-shek would ignore the "realistic" significance of this article.
    How did Wu Han use "history to satirize reality"?
    He used the topic of analyzing the situation at the end of the Ming Dynasty to insinuate the reality at that time: "Part of the territory was lost to bandits, and part was ravaged by foreign troops." In order to strengthen the hint, he repeatedly said "bandits ravaged Shanxi and Shaanxi" and "bandits boldly expanded into Henan." Obviously, Wu Han was standing on Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist and anti-people stance, equating the anti-Japanese base areas led by the Communist Party with the occupied areas of Japanese imperialism, saying that the territory was lost to "bandits" and foreign countries. What was the most important "historical lesson" that he wanted Chiang Kai-shek to accept? It was "Zuo Liangyu, who had hundreds of thousands of troops and occupied the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, remained unmoved... He was unwilling to use all his strength to eliminate the bandits, but instead used all his strength to expand the troops." He wanted Chiang Kai-shek to command those Zuo Liangyus who were "remaining unmoved" to use "all their strength to eliminate" the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army, which Wu Han falsely called "bandits."
    The three "security proposals" "On Scholars," "On Corruption," and "Historical Lessons Three Hundred Years Ago" collectively reflect Wu Han's political stance at that time. Mr. Zhou Yutong, Wu Han's old friend, said that Wu Han was an "honest official," which is indeed very reasonable and knows Wu Han very well. Wu Han is indeed Chiang Kai-shek's "honest official."
      An Enthusiastic Advocate of the Third Road
    In 1950, Wu Han boasted in his article "I Overcame the 'Super-Class' Viewpoint" that as early as the late stage of the Anti-Japanese War, he "thought that the Communist Party was right, good, the savior of China, and only the Communist Party could save China." That is to say, at that time, he accepted the political views of the Chinese Communist Party.
    In "Collection of Javelins," his article "On Neutrality," written in August 1946, is included, in which it is mentioned five times: "There is no middle road!" "There is no middle road." "Absolutely not standing in the middle." "Absolutely no middle road." "There is no such term as the middle road."
    Look, how revolutionary, how progressive, how firm, how supportive of the Chinese Communist Party's political line Wu Han was back then, and how deeply he hated the middle road, even wanting to resolutely eliminate this term!
    Please do not be fooled. This is a big lie!
    Wu Han back then was the most enthusiastic advocate of the third road, that is, the middle road. It was he himself who regarded himself as a representative of the "middle class," which accounted for more than 90% of the population and was neither the Kuomintang nor the Communist Party, and promoted the middle road, opposing the Chinese Communist Party's general line of democratic revolution.
    The five places mentioned above where he opposed the middle road were all secretly added by him in 1959 after liberation by "fraud and malfeasance." This is really "a guilty conscience betrays itself; Wang Er next door has never stolen anything."
    As early as 1943, in the first "security proposal" he submitted to Chiang Kai-shek—"On Corruption"—he put forward the most fundamental political proposition: "Changing the social organization from family-based to individual-based," that is, changing feudalism to capitalism. Establishing a state of the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, or a democratic state of the bourgeoisie, in essence, can only consolidate the reactionary rule of the semi-feudal and semi-colonial old China. This is Wu Han's consistent ideal for more than 20 years. This is diametrically opposed to the Chinese Communist Party's political views.
    After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, there were two futures in front of the Chinese people: one was to establish a new democratic state of the people led by the proletariat, and the other was to establish a semi-colonial and semi-feudal state of the dictatorship of landlords and the big bourgeoisie. The decisive battle between the two futures and the two destinies began. Under such circumstances, Wu Han and others became tools of American imperialism, trying to act as "middle-style mediators" and "relatively balanced forces" in this political struggle, carrying out political speculation and making a big profit.
    After the signing of the old Political Consultative Conference agreement, Wu Han was overjoyed and said, "On the horizon of the Far East, a ray of dawn is gradually revealed, and China is reborn." He thought that since the Kuomintang "recognized" the legal status of various political parties, they could "compete with doctrines on an equal footing in the future, strive for the trust of the people, and embark on the normal path of multi-party politics." Wu Han wanted to use his American goods to compete with the Communist Party on an "equal footing."
    Chiang Kai-shek's sound of launching an all-out civil war made Wu Han's "middle-style mediator" unable to do it. So, he advocated establishing a "new foundation." What is the "new foundation" he said? It is said that it is "beyond party interests" and "represents the interests of the broad masses of the people," that is, beyond the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. Its backbone is the "middle class" (?), which accounts for more than 90% of the population. Wu Han, such an "outstanding democratic fighter," is their representative. Wu Han announced that it was "the guide to China's future." What he meant was that the Chinese Communist Party does not represent the interests of the broad masses of the people and cannot lead the Chinese revolution; only the so-called "outstanding democratic fighters" like Wu Han are "completely standing on the people's position as the guide to China's future." So, he clamored arrogantly, "This force itself is the balance scale, deciding everything and executing everything!" Please see, to what extent Wu Han's advocacy of the third road, the middle road, and the establishment of a middle force reached! Wu Han actually said in 1950, just over three years later, that he had long realized at that time that "only the Communist Party can save China." The courage to lie like this is really shocking!
    The third road is essentially the road of the dictatorship of the comprador bourgeoisie. China's bourgeoisie is very weak and cannot come up with anything that can deceive people. In order to promote this road, they had to go to the West to seek reinforcements and vigorously promote British and American-style "democracy." Wu Han is the same.
    There are really too many words of Wu Han praising Western bourgeois democracy. Only one example is given to see a glimpse.
    In July 1946, he advocated in the article "On Legitimacy" that learning from the "example" of American "democracy." Saying: "Taking the real politics of the United States and Britain as the standard, President Roosevelt was re-elected four times. Each time, he used open and legal election methods—so the party led by President Roosevelt is the ruling party. They use the political program, especially the past achievements of several administrations, to ask voters for votes and compete with another party. As a result, the voters chose them. Mr. Roosevelt and his party gained power by the choice of voters and continued to be in power for many years.
    ...
    Yes, we have to learn the democratic methods of the American people. The American government is the legitimate government recognized by the whole world and all mankind because this government is elected by the American people."⑤
    Wu Han really admired the "democracy" of the United States. He completely erased the class essence of the dictatorship of the American monopoly bourgeoisie and portrayed it as a "national state." Comrade Mao Zedong had long said: "The United States also has 'democratic politics,' but unfortunately, it is just another name for the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie."⑥ Whether it is Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy, or Johnson, they are all birds of a feather and are tools of the monopoly bourgeoisie to implement dictatorship over the people.
    The road of bourgeois dictatorship put forward by Wu Han is opposed to the general line of the new democratic revolution put forward by the Chinese Communist Party.
    His so-called third road is completely in line with the needs of American imperialism. Wu Han, like his teacher Hu Shi, is a complete foreign slave.
    In January 1946, just as American imperialism was using great force to transport and equip Kuomintang troops to help Chiang Kai-shek fight a big civil war, Wu Han and Pan Guangdan, Fei Xiaotong, and others jointly wrote a letter to Marshall, the special envoy of the President of the United States, saying in a nauseating way: "When we welcome you, our hearts are full of shame. How can the Chinese people not know that the responsibility for causing the civil war should be borne entirely by ourselves?... We... have tried our best to appeal for peace to both sides of the armed conflict and stop the civil war,... We are ashamed that we cannot sort out our own housework and trouble our good friends to mediate; but we will not forget your great achievements in Chinese history." "We do not protect the Communist Party, which is in the opposition and has military force, and we also oppose any political party privately possessing military force."
    "We hope that international friends, for the sake of world peace, will not only dissuade the Kuomintang and the Communist Party from fighting each other but also effectively provide assistance in building democracy politically and economically." "We are not only grateful for your service but also have confidence in it,... We wish you a great achievement in history that will be forever remembered by our future generations."
    Although Wu Han did not dare to include this extremely shameless, extremely reactionary, and unseen letter that lacked national integrity in "Collection of Javelins," his foreign slave nature was also exposed in this collection.
    In the original text of "A Warning to General Hurley," which is included in "Collection of Javelins," the American invading army, which was rampant in Chinese territory and owed the Chinese people countless blood debts, was openly praised as a "democratic fighter."
    In June 1946, in order to please American imperialism, Wu Han shamelessly said, "Only a peaceful, democratic, and prosperous China can become the market that the United States needs." In August of the same year, he offered advice to American imperialism, asking them to shake olive branches and sprinkle a little relief powder when they invaded China, saying, "The best foundation for maintaining China's open door is sincere friendship, mutual respect, and cooperation based on the common interests of the two peoples.... China's door is always open to sincere friends."⑦
    Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in 1947: "Among the upper petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie in the Chiang Kai-shek-ruled areas, there is a small number of people, that is, the right-wing elements of these classes, who have reactionary political tendencies. They spread illusions for American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, and they oppose the people's democratic revolution."⑧ Wu Han is such an anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary bourgeois right-wing element who wholeheartedly serves American imperialism.
        A Veteran Anti-Communist
    Wu Han not only inherited his research methods and academic line from Hu Shi but also inherited his anti-communist and anti-people political ideas.
    In 1934, just when the Red Army began the Long March, and just when Hu Shi was vigorously recommending Wu Han, this specimen, to young people in the newspaper, Wu Han wrote "The Social Background of the 'Bandits' in the Late Ming Dynasty," offering advice to the Chiang Kai-shek group on how to eliminate the peasant rebel army—the Red Army—led by the proletariat by adopting a method of appeasement and suppression.
    In 1943, Chiang Kai-shek published "China's Destiny," clamoring to eliminate the Communist Party within two years, and at the same time launched the third anti-communist upsurge, preparing to attack the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. At this time, Wu Han wrote "Ming Taizu" (also known as "From Monk's Bowl to Imperial Power," which is the first version of "Biography of Zhu Yuanzhang"), introducing Zhu Yuanzhang's reactionary rule "experience" to Chiang Kai-shek: "Prohibiting all cults." Saying that "later facts proved Ming Taizu's foresight. The remnants of the Red Army in the northwest were not completely eliminated. More than forty years later, they started uprisings everywhere... Although they were all put down by the government by force, it can be seen the relationship between religion and politics in this era." The historical Hai Rui presented a "Pingli Memorial" to the emperor, attempting to eliminate the revolutionary forces at that time; the modern Wu Han wrote "Ming Taizu," which was actually a new "Pingli Memorial" to Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to eliminate the people's revolutionary forces.
    In the early days of the Liberation War, who was the culprit of launching the civil war was a fundamental issue of principle at that time. Whether it was revolution or counter-revolution, whether it was a true revolution or a fake revolution, whether it was truly anti-Chiang or falsely anti-Chiang, whether it was supporting the Communist Party or opposing the Communist Party was a touchstone. What did Wu Han, who claimed to be "anti-Chiang," say on this issue?
    He said: "The current military crux lies in the fact that the Kuomintang wants the Communist Party to withdraw from certain areas, and the Communist Party says that it can withdraw its troops from some areas, but the political organization must be retained. The Kuomintang wants to withdraw together and cannot retain it. If the left cannot agree, and the right cannot agree, they have to fight first." That is to say, the Kuomintang is certainly responsible for the outbreak of the civil war, but the Communist Party also has a share. If the Communist Party gives in, one hand cannot clap, and the civil war cannot break out.
    Wu Han, who only represented a small number of bourgeois right-wing elements, arrogantly regarded himself as a representative of the "people" and opposed the people's revolutionary war. He said: "The people have no interest in party disputes, and they are determined to oppose the use of force to resolve party disputes." He incited "the people not to participate, not to support the civil war,... all the people should rise up to passively resist the civil war." He openly called: "On this beautiful land, all the soldiers should put down their guns. At that moment, the Republic of China will embark on the glorious and peaceful road!"
    Chiang Kai-shek is the culprit of launching the civil war, and opposing the civil war can only aim the spearhead at Chiang Kai-shek. When Chiang Kai-shek launched an attack on the liberated areas, and the soldiers and civilians in the liberated areas rose up to carry out a revolutionary war of self-defense, anyone standing on the side of the Chinese people should fully support the people's revolutionary war. However, Wu Han wanted "all the soldiers to put down their guns" and wanted "all the people to rise up to passively resist the civil war," which was actually to ask the people to lay down their weapons and surrender in the face of the reactionary offensive. Is this not an accomplice of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionaries?
    Wu Han also actively undermined the revolutionary mass movement of the people in the Chiang-controlled areas to oppose Chiang and directly offered advice to Chiang Kai-shek.
    In June 1946, five days before the mass demonstration of 100,000 people in Shanghai against Chiang Kai-shek, Wu Han published an article in the Shanghai "Weekly," saying, "If the civil war can be stopped by appealing with a simple telegram-style declaration"... "If a parade and demonstration can curb the civil war"... "Then, there have been so many parades and demonstrations in the past"... "The civil war should have stopped long ago." He said that "it is not enough to just shout for a while, jump for a while, move your pen, and move your mouth." He wanted to use his so-called "long-term" and "constructive" empty slogans to disperse the people's fighting spirit and disintegrate the mass anti-Chiang movement.⑨ In order to oppose the "December 9th" Movement, Hu Shi said, "In this disaster, all sensational slogans are certainly empty and useless, and even a protest at the right time is at best a temporary remedy."⑩ Wu Han faithfully implemented Hu Shi's reactionary line back then. At this time, in order to serve Chiang Kai-shek, he once again took out this set of things to poison the people.
    In August 1946, in his article "What to Do?" he asked Chiang Kai-shek to throw out small favors, do some "good deeds," deceive the people, and save their crumbling rule. He said: "I want to advise the Kuomintang authorities in the capacity of the people to do more good deeds while they are still in power today. Do it immediately, do it first, and then talk about it; it is better to do it without saying it. The hungry are easy to feed, and the thirsty are easy to drink. It is not difficult to satisfy the people.... I dare to guarantee that the people will also guarantee that as long as you can achieve these things completely, you will not worry about the people not standing on your side."?
    With a worried mood, Wu Han considered the "future" of the Kuomintang, saying that "the only consequence of fighting a civil war is... to escape Yang and return to Mo, to drive fish into the abyss, creating a stronger Communist Party and a more declining Kuomintang, which is also not worth it."? He also said, "We can't fight anymore!" "Only by doing this can it be a blessing to the Chinese people and also a blessing to the Kuomintang."?
    These materials are enough to show that Wu Han's so-called opposition to the civil war is afraid that the Communist Party will become stronger and stronger as the Kuomintang fights more and more decline. What he fears most is the victory of the Communist Party.
    Speaking of this, Wu Han will argue again, didn't I go to the liberated area in 1948?
    The problem is not whether you went to the liberated area or not. Many people who were once infected with the ideology of democratic individualism, with the development of the people's revolutionary war, gradually recognized the reactionary essence of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and their views on the Chinese Communist Party have also changed. The people have always welcomed their progress. However, Wu Han is completely the opposite of these people. He is a speculative politician who is good at observing the situation and changing his course according to the wind. In the second half of 1948, the complete victory of the People's Liberation War was already in sight. At this time, he colluded with Luo Longji, wanting to engage in political speculation and bargain with our Party as a leading figure of the democratic parties. Although he arrived in the liberated area, he still stubbornly clung to his bourgeois political ambitions. This man, who claimed to be a representative of the "middle class" accounting for more than 90% of the population, was not willing to be led by the Communist Party. After entering the liberated area, "seeing slogans like 'Long live Chairman Mao,' he felt a little uncomfortable, always feeling why bother with this 'long live' thing."? Wu Han is a person with a rebellious bone in the back of his head who has infiltrated the revolutionary camp.
    Not long after Wu Han entered the liberated area, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his New Year's message in 1949—"Carry the Revolution Through to the End"—that with the victory of the Liberation War throughout the country, the Chinese reactionaries and the American invaders are paying more and more attention to the methods of political struggle day by day. They "are designing to use certain people who are connected with the Chinese reactionaries and the American invaders and also connected with the revolutionary camp to provoke and instigate them, asking them to work hard to infiltrate the revolutionary camp, forming a so-called opposition faction in the revolutionary camp in order to preserve the reactionary forces and undermine the revolutionary forces... Many people have not yet seen this situation clearly, but it will not be long before people can see it clearly."? Wu Han finally openly exposed his true face as a veteran anti-communist who opposed the Party and opposed socialism in the late 1950s and early 1960s, once again proving Comrade Mao Zedong's brilliant prediction.
    Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Political Program
    A black gun that advises the Kuomintang reactionaries on their criminal rule and enthusiastically promotes the third road guided by American imperialism, suddenly re-emerged in 1959, "old guns thrown anew," why is this?
    This issue must be examined from the background of class struggle at that time.
    The summer of 1959 was precisely the time when the socialist revolution and the capitalist restoration were in sharp struggle in our country. The revolutionary masses, according to the direction pointed out by the Party, held high the great red banner of the general line, insisted on the Great Leap Forward, insisted on the People's Commune, and resolutely took the socialist road. The great revolutionary initiative of the people's masses made all reactionary forces that opposed the socialist revolution panic. The right-leaning opportunists, that is, the revisionists, who represented the forces of capitalist restoration, took advantage of the difficulties caused to us by natural disasters and some of our shortcomings in our progress and launched a frenzied attack on the Party. In this attack, Wu Han, hidden in the people's revolutionary camp, could not wait to step forward and act as a vanguard of anti-Party and anti-socialism.
    "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor," published in June 1959, and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," published in January 1961, represent two stages of Wu Han's anti-Party and anti-people activities. "Collection of Javelins" was published after "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and before "Hai Rui

    评吴晗的《投枪集》		史绍宾
    一九五九年六、七月，吴晗在《海瑞骂皇帝》发表的同时，又把他四十年代写的杂文编集成《投枪集》出版。
    吴晗为什么选择庐山会议前夕抛出这批旧货并且命名为《投枪集》呢？他在《前言》里说：“我们当年的确这样想过，这样说过，这样骂过，这样斗争过，这一段历史，是值得回忆的，也还是值得年青的一代参考的。”在《海瑞骂皇帝》里，他颂扬海瑞那种敢“骂”的勇敢精神；在这里，他又毛遂自荐，要人们“回忆”、“参考”他自己“骂过”、“斗争过”的“光荣历史”，并且把这种“骂”的精神点化为自己的一杆“枪”，然后宣称：“有枪总得使，怎么办？放不得，投它一下如何，管它三七二十一，要是投中了，也会有点痛的，……”于是，他就把这本杂文，命名为《投枪集》。
    我们要认真考察一下，吴晗在四十年代写的那些杂文究竟是一杆什么枪？它在当时是投向谁的？他在一九五九年拿出来，又是投向谁的？
      一个政治骗局
    吴晗长期以来吹嘘自己四十年代的所谓“革命”历史，这是他招摇撞骗，反党反人民的主要政治资本。
    其实，他所炫耀的“革命”历史，是彻头彻尾的捏造！
    从解放以来，吴晗就着手伪造自己四十年代的历史。随着社会主义革命的逐步深入，为了适应自己反党反社会主义的政治目的，他对自己历史的捏造，也逐步“升级”，一连串神话越编越离奇。到了现在，吴晗竟把自己打扮成了一个民主革命时代的“英雄”。
    让我们来排一个吴晗伪造历史的时间表：
    一九四九年五月，他写了《我的治学与思想是怎样进步的？》①，里面有一段颇值得玩味的话：
    “我在清华大学读书的时候，成年成月把自己关在研究室里，教书的时候因为讨厌国民党腐败，不愿接触政治，自己专心于学术研究，一九三七年到昆明时，仍然抱这种态度。但自一九四○年以来国民党统治愈来愈坏，湘桂战役一败涂地，加之恶性通货膨胀，自己生活也跟着一般人一天天困苦，于是对国民党由讨厌到痛恨。”话说得多么漂亮，三十年代就“讨厌”国民党，四十年代以来又由“讨厌”到“痛恨”。
    但是，事实证明，吴晗在三十年代“专心于学术研究”，并不是什么“讨厌国民党”的表现，而是忠实执行胡适为国民党效劳的“科学救国”反动路线的表现。
    不过，刚解放，吴晗伪造历史的胆子还不象后来那么大，还多多少少透露了一点真实的消息。比如说，他对国民党态度的一些转变，主要是在湘桂战役以后，即一九四四年以后；原因则在于，“生活也跟着一般人一天天困苦”，不能再保持和“一般人”的不同，不能再“养尊处优”了。这时，他还不敢大肆渲染他对国民党究竟怎样“痛恨”。
    到了一九五○年一月，吴晗在《我克服了“超阶级”观点》一文中②，就升了一大级。他说：
    在行动方面说，十年来是跟着进步力量走的，在紧要关头也没有吝惜过自己”。从此，把自己打扮成了一个为了革命“没有吝惜过自己”的“英雄”。而且在文章中大言不惭地说，“我和一多”怎样怎样，把自己和闻一多相提并论，从烈士身上捞取政治资本。
    一九五九年七月，吴晗在为《投枪集》写的《前言》里面，更升一级，硬把自己挤进闻一多、李公朴这些革命烈士的行列中去，说什么当时自己写的文章，刺痛了国民党，“要不痛，怎么会连李公朴闻一多这样的人也乱杀？”
    我们要质问吴晗：闻一多、李公朴和国民党反动派坚决斗争，英勇牺牲的时候，你在哪里？干了些什么？
    “闻一多拍案而起，横眉怒对国民党的手枪，宁可倒下去，不愿屈服。”③而你呢？要你与闻一多一起留下来，你却坐上飞机，去奔自己的“锦绣前程”。这叫做“在紧要关头，也没有吝惜过自己”吗？这样的吴晗，竟然把自己与革命烈士并排在一起，真是不知人间有羞耻事！
    到了一九六五年十二月，吴晗为了抵制批判，进行反攻，在《关于〈海瑞罢官〉的自我批评》中，④把牛皮吹到了极点，公然说自己“二十多年来一直在党的教育、培养、关怀下，政治上的阶级立场是站稳了的。”这样，一个进行政治投机的流氓，摇身一变，竟然成了二十多年来站稳了立场的坚定的无产阶级革命英雄！
    在上述一连串伪造历史的记录中，最值得我们注意的是，吴晗在一九五九年发表《海瑞骂皇帝》的同时出版的《投枪集》。《投枪集》收的几十篇杂文中，贯串着反动的资产阶级立场。吴晗正是要拿这些资产阶级的黑货直接配合右倾机会主义分子的进攻，把它投向社会主义。但是，如果把这几十篇杂文的原貌和盘托出，就会揭穿他多年伪装的进步面具。又要“投枪”，又要粉饰自己的历史，“怎么办”？于是，吴晗冥思苦想，“想了个把月”，精心制造了一个政治骗局。
    骗局之一：吴晗说，“重温这些文章，大体上都是骂国民党的。”他这么说，是企图免除人们的怀疑，叫人不去怀疑它的真实性。不仅如此，说穿了，这是要用骂国民党的话，来骂共产党，骂无产阶级专政。
    骗局之二：吴晗说，“在当时情况下，行文时只能国民党和共产党并提，虽然语气有不同，中心论点有不同，但在提法上，只能这样说，不这样是发表不了的。”由于书中明明有着反共语调，要让人们一点不生疑惑是不可能的，吴晗又托辞于“当时的情况”。这就是说，“国民党和共产党并提”，乃是有不得已的苦衷。骂共产党，是因为“只能这样说，不这样是发表不了的。”为了能够骂国民党，不得不让共产党陪斩！其责在于环境，并不在他呵！吴晗用这种手法把他当年骂共产党的话公然重新拿出来，这不是反党反社会主义，又是什么呢？
    骗局之三：吴晗说，“收在这个集子里的文章，除个别地方文字上稍加改动以外，如满清一律改作清朝之类——基本上没有什么修改。”吴晗郑重声明这些文章“基本上没有什么修改”；如果“以今天的看法来代替十多年前的看法”，那是“作伪舞弊”，“何苦呢，又何必呢”？这是他最后的一着棋，是一种政治骗子的手段。他以为，既然作了这样的声明，别人就不会想到这位自称尊重“历史事实”的“学者”，竟会上下其手，“作伪舞弊”，从文章里抹去一堆见不得天日的反动东西！
    一九五九年出版的《投枪集》和原来发表的文章对照，有许多重大的删改，改掉了许多露骨的反共、反革命的东西，绝不只是“满清”改为“清朝”之类的个别改动，更不是“基本上没有什么修改”。——吴晗究竟怎样篡改原文，其中大有奥妙，我们不惜篇幅，作了个校勘表，附于篇后，也算是“奇文共欣赏”吧！
    骗局终难持久，谎言掩盖不住事实。
    下面，我们就来剥开《投枪集》的画皮，看看吴晗的本来面目。
    吴晗向国民党三上“治安疏”
    《投枪集》没有收入一九四三年以前的文章，这不是偶然的。吴晗自己也觉得，一九四三年以前，他对国民党死心塌地，一点“火气”、“辣气”都没有，拿不出装样子的“骂国民党”的东西来。吴晗怎样从不骂到骂，所谓“骂”又是怎样性质的骂，一九四三、一九四四年写的《说士》、《论贪污》、《三百年前的历史教训》三篇文章，勾画出了他的脸谱。
    一九四三年，吴晗在国民党官方报纸《云南日报》上发表《论贪污》一文。如果我们把这篇文章和吴晗在一九五九年大吹大擂的海瑞“骂”皇帝的《治安疏》对比，就会发现很有意思的“巧合”。
    海瑞在《治安疏》里列举当时“不治不安”的情况是：“吏贪将弱，民不聊生，水旱靡时，盗贼滋炽”。吴晗则说当时“内政不修”的现象是：“政出多门，机构庞冗，横征暴敛，法令滋彰，宠佞用事，民困无告，货币紊乱，盗贼横行，水旱为灾等等”，“而最普遍最传统的一个现象是贪污。”
    海瑞向嘉靖皇帝表白，他上《治安疏》的目的是为明王朝“求万世治安”。吴晗则向蒋介石集团表白，他所以写《论贪污》，是为了“翻翻陈账，看看历代覆亡之原，再针对现状，求出对症的药石，也许可以对抗建大业有些小补”，亦即帮助蒋介石总结统治的经验教训，使他免遭“覆亡”。
    当然，海瑞是四百年前的一个封建官僚，他向嘉靖皇帝提出的方案只能是“正君道，明臣职”，说来说去还是维持封建纪纲那一套；而现代的吴晗为蒋介石设计的解决社会问题的蓝图，却是“把‘人’从家族的桎梏下解放出来。……从家族本位的社会组织改变为个人本位的社会组织”。换句话说，吴晗是希望蒋介石修明内政，实行一些资本主义性质的改革，求得蒋家王朝的“万世治安”，自己也好“爬在桌子底下等啃骨头”。这是现代化的海瑞的“正君道，明臣职”。
    在《说士》这篇文章里，吴晗征引“史实”，上及春秋，下迄近代，反复说明“士”（知识分子）对统治阶级的重要作用。他说，士对“上层的贵族阶级说，是维持治权的唯一动力，王、诸侯、大夫如不能得到士的支持，不但政权立刻崩溃，连身家也不能保全。”他代表一部分想从蒋家王朝找出路的资产阶级知识分子，向当时“上层的贵族阶级”——蒋介石集团呼吁：“要提高士的社会地位”，并且说，“这是今后全国所应全力以赴的课题。”这是吴晗向蒋介石上的第二个“治安疏”。
    但是，蒋介石这个寡头独夫，连一片小小的“民主布”也不想要，对吴晗的这个“治安疏”并不赏脸。吴晗的物质生活也每况愈下，教授的“身分早已经没有了”，和“一般人”没有什么区别，于是，吴晗有点骂人了。
    可是，吴晗并没有死心。一有机会，就要向蒋介石献策，希望得到重用。一九四四年，他三上“治安疏”，又在国民党官方报纸《正义报》上抛出了他的《三百年前的历史教训》。
    这篇文章开头说：“历史是一面镜子，三百年前，有太多的事情，值得我们追念。”结尾又说：“三百年后，我们想想三百年前的情形，殷鉴不远，在夏后氏之世。”吴晗翻来复去强调这一点，生怕蒋介石忽略了这篇文章的“现实”意义。
    吴晗是怎样用“历史讽刺现实”的呢？
    他借分析明末形势的题目，影射当时的现实：“国土一部分沦于流寇，一部分被异族兵威所蹂躏”。为了加强暗示，他反复说“流寇纵横晋陕”，“流寇主力恣张晋豫”等等。很明显，吴晗是站在蒋介石反共、反人民的立场上，把共产党领导的抗日根据地和日本帝国主义的占领区等同起来，说什么国土沦于
  “流寇”和异族。他要蒋介石接受的最重要的“历史教训”是什么呢？就是“拥兵数十万虎踞长江上游的左良玉，却按兵不动，……他不肯用全力来消灭流寇，却用全力来扩充队伍”。要蒋介石指挥那些“按兵不动”的左良玉们，用“全力来消灭”被吴晗诬称为“流寇”的八路军、新四军。
    《说士》、《论贪污》、《三百年前的历史教训》这三篇“治安疏”，集中地反映了吴晗当时的政治立场。吴晗的老朋友周予同先生说吴晗是“清官”，确实是很有道理的，确实是深知吴晗的，吴晗确实是蒋介石的“清官”。
      第三条道路的狂热鼓吹者
    一九五○年，吴晗在《我克服了“超阶级”观点》一文中，自我吹嘘，早在抗日战争后期，他就“以为共产党是对的，好的，中国的救星，只有共产党才能挽救中国。”这就是说，当时他就接受了中国共产党的政治主张。
    在《投枪集》中，收进了他在一九四六年八月写的《论中立》一文，里面五处提到：“中间路线是没有的！”“中间路线是没有的。”“绝对不站在中间。”“绝对没有中间路线。”“没有中间路线这一个名词。”
    你看，当年的吴晗是多么革命，多么进步，多么坚定，多么拥护中国共产党的政治路线，对中间路线是多么深恶痛绝，连这个名词都要坚决消灭掉！
    请勿上当，这是弥天大谎！
    当年的吴晗是第三条道路，即中间路线最狂热的鼓吹者。正是他自己，以所谓既不是国民党，又不是共产党，而是占人口百分之九十以上的“中间阶层”的代表自居，标榜中间路线，反对中国共产党的民主革命总路线。
    上面提到的五处反对中间路线的话，都是他“作伪舞弊”，在解放后的一九五九年，偷偷地添上去的。这真是“此地无银三百两，隔壁王二不曾偷”，做贼心虚，贼喊捉贼！
    早在一九四三年，在给蒋介石上的第一个“治安疏”——《论贪污》中，他就提出了最根本的政治主张：“从家族本位的社会组织改变为个人本位的社会组织”，亦即把封建主义的社会改变为资本主义的社会。建立资产阶级专政的国家，或者说资产阶级民主的国家，实质上，这只能是巩固半封建、半殖民地的旧中国的反动统治，这就是吴晗二十多年来一贯追求的理想。这是和中国共产党的政治主张针锋相对的。
    抗日战争胜利以后，在中国人民面前摆着两个前途：一个是建立无产阶级领导的人民大众的新民主主义的国家，一个是建立大地主大资产阶级专政的半殖民地半封建的国家。两个前途、两种命运的决战开始了。在这种情况下，吴晗等人成为美帝国主义的工具，妄想充当“中间式的调人”、“相对的平衡的力量”，在这场政治斗争中，进行政治投机，大捞一把。
    旧政协协议签字以后，吴晗欢喜欲狂，说什么“远东的天际，逐露一线晨曦，中国新生了。”他以为国民党既然“承认”了各个政党的法律地位，今后就可以“在平等的地位上用主义来竞争，来争取人民的信任，走上多党政治的常轨了。”吴晗是想用他的美国货，在“平等的地位”上和共产党竞争。
    蒋介石发动全面内战的炮声，使吴晗“中间式的调人”做不成了，于是，他鼓吹建立一种“新基础”。什么是他所说的
  “新基础”呢？据说，它是“超出党派利益”，“代表广大的人民利益的”，也就是超出国民党，又超出共产党的利益的。它的中坚力量，是占人口百分之九十以上（？）的“中间阶层”，吴晗这样的“卓越的民主斗士”就是他们的代表。吴晗宣布，它是“中国前途的引导者”。他的意思就是说，中国共产党不代表广大人民的利益，不能领导中国革命；只有吴晗之流的所谓
  “卓越的民主斗士”，才是“完全站在人民立场的中国前途的引导者”，所以他狂妄地叫嚷，“这力量的本身就是天平秤，决定一切，执行一切”！请看，吴晗鼓吹第三条道路，鼓吹中间路线，鼓吹建立中间力量，达到了何等猖狂的地步！吴晗竟然在仅隔三年多以后的一九五○年，说自己当时早已认识到“只有共产党才能挽救中国”，这种撒谎的勇气，实在令人吃惊！
    第三条道路实质上就是买办资产阶级专政的道路。中国的资产阶级非常软弱，拿不出装样子的东西来骗人。他们为了鼓吹这条道路，只好到西方搬取救兵，极力宣扬英、美式的“民主”。吴晗也是这样。
    吴晗吹捧西方资产阶级民主制的话，实在太多，只举一例，以见一斑。
    一九四六年七月，他在《论法统》一文中，鼓吹学习美国“民主”的“榜样”。说：“以美国、英国的现实政治作准绳，故罗斯福总统连任了四次，每一次都由公开的合法的选举方法——故罗斯福总统所领导的党是执政党，他们由政纲政策，尤其重要的是过去几度执政的政绩，来要求选民的选票，和另一政党竞选。结果，选民果然选择了他们。罗斯福先生和他的党凭选民的选择取得政权，而且继续当政多年。
    …………
    是的，我们得学学美国人民的民主方式，美国的政府是全世界全人类所公认的合法政府，因为这政府是由美国人民选举出来的。”⑤
    吴晗对美国的“民主”，真是佩服得五体投地，完全抹煞了美国垄断资产阶级专政的阶级本质，把它描绘成一个“全民国家”。毛泽东同志早就说过：“美国也有‘民主政治’，可惜只是资产阶级一个阶级的独裁统治的别名。”⑥不管是罗斯福也好，艾森豪威尔、肯尼迪、约翰逊也好，他们都是一丘之貉，都是垄断资产阶级对人民实行专政的工具。
    吴晗提出的资产阶级专政的道路，是和中国共产党提出的新民主主义革命的总路线相对抗的。
    他的所谓第三条道路，是完全适应美帝国主义需要的。吴晗和他的恩师胡适一样，是一个地地道道的洋奴。
    一九四六年一月，正当美帝国主义用极大力量运输和装备国民党军队，帮助蒋介石大打内战的时候，吴晗和潘光旦、费孝通等人，联名写信给美国总统特使马歇尔，肉麻地说：“我们在欢迎你的时候，心里又充满着惭愧。中国人民怎么不知道引起内战的，责任是全部应当由我们自己负担的？……我们……已尽力向武装冲突的双方呼吁和平，停止内战，……我们惭愧自己不能把自己的家务整理明白，有劳我们的好友的斡旋；但是我们也不会忘记你们在中国历史上的伟大功绩。”“我们并不袒护在野而有武力的共产党，我们也反对任何政党私有武力。”
  “我们盼望国际的友人，为了世界和平，不但要劝阻国共交锋，而且能有效地在政治上和经济上给予建设民主的助力。”“我们对于你的服务不但感激而且有信心，……敬祝你在历史上留下为我们后世子孙永志不忘的伟迹。”
    吴晗虽然不敢把这封极端无耻、极端反动、见不得人、毫无民族气节的信收在《投枪集》里，但是，他的洋奴本性在这本集子里同样暴露了出来。
    收在《投枪集》里的《正告赫尔利将军》的原文中，公然把在中国领土上横行霸道，欠下中国人民累累血债的美国侵略军捧为“民主斗士”。
    一九四六年六月，吴晗为了讨好美帝国主义，居然恬不知耻地说，“只有和平民主繁荣的中国，才能够成为美国所需要的市场”。同年八月，他又向美帝国主义献策，要他们在侵略中国的时候，摇摇橄榄枝，多洒一点救济粉，说什么“维持中国门户开放的最好基础是衷诚的友谊，相互的尊重和基于两国人民共同利益的合作，……中国的门户是永远为真诚友人开着的。”⑦
    毛泽东同志在一九四七年曾经指出：“蒋介石统治区域的上层小资产阶级和中等资产阶级，其中有为数不多的一部分人，即这些阶级的右翼分子，存在着反动的政治倾向，他们替美国帝国主义和蒋介石反动集团散布幻想，他们反对人民民主革命。”⑧吴晗正是这样一个反共、反人民、反革命，全心全意为美帝国主义效劳的资产阶级右翼分子。
        反共的老手
    吴晗不仅从胡适那里继承了他的治学方法和学术路线，也继承了他的反共、反人民的政治思想。
    一九三四年，正是红军开始长征的时候，也正是胡适在报纸上大力向青年推荐吴晗这个标本的时候，吴晗写了《晚明“流寇”之社会背景》，向蒋介石集团献策，用以抚济剿的办法来消灭无产阶级领导的农民起义军——红军。
    一九四三年，蒋介石发表《中国之命运》，叫嚷要在两年内消灭共产党，同时发动第三次反共高潮，准备进攻陕甘宁边区。吴晗在这个时候写了《明太祖》（又名《由僧钵到皇权》，是《朱元璋传》的第一个版本），向蒋介石介绍朱元璋的反动统治“经验”：“禁止一切邪教”。说什么“后来的事实证明了明太祖的先见，红军在西北的余党并没有完全消灭，过了四十多年又四处起事，……虽然都被政府用武力削平，却可看出这个时代里宗教和政治的关系。”历史上的海瑞向皇帝献了一个《平黎疏》，企图消灭当时的革命力量；现代的吴晗写的《明太祖》，实际上是向蒋介石上的一个新“平黎疏”，妄图消灭人民革命力量。
    在解放战争初期，谁是发动内战的罪魁祸首，这是当时一个根本的原则问题。是革命还是反革命，是真革命还是假革命，是真反蒋还是假反蒋，是拥护共产党还是反对共产党，这是一个试金石。自称为“反蒋”的吴晗，在这个问题上是怎么说的呢？
    他说：“目前军事的症结在于国民党要共产党退出若干地区，共产党呢，表示有些地区可以撤出军队，政治机构则非保留不可。国民党呢，要一起撤退，不能保留。左说不拢，右说不拢，只好打了再说。”就是说，内战打起来，国民党固然有责任，共产党也有一份，如果共产党让了步，一个巴掌拍不响，内战就打不起来了。
    这个只代表一小撮资产阶级右翼分子的吴晗，狂妄地以
  “人民”的代表自居，反对人民革命战争，他说：“人民对于党争无兴趣，对以兵力解决党争则誓死反对”。他煽动“人民不参加，不支持内战，……全体人民起来消极的抵制内战。”他公开号召：“在这块大好河山的土地上，所有的士兵都放下枪杆，这一瞬间，中华民国就走上光荣和平的康庄大道！”
    蒋介石是发动内战的罪魁祸首，反对内战只能把矛头对准蒋介石。当蒋介石向解放区发动进攻，解放区军民奋起进行革命自卫战争的时候，任何一个站在中国人民方面的人，只应该全力支持人民的革命战争。而吴晗却要“所有的士兵都放下枪杆”，要“全体人民起来消极的抵制内战”，实际上是要人民在反动派的进攻面前，放下武器，举手投降。这不是蒋介石反动派的帮凶又是什么呢？
    吴晗还积极破坏蒋管区人民反蒋的革命群众运动，直接为蒋介石出谋划策。
    一九四六年六月，在上海十万人民反蒋大示威的前五天，吴晗在上海《周报》发表文章说，“假如凭一纸通电式宣言的呼吁，……就可以停止内战”，“假如游行示威可以遏止内战，……那末，过去有过多少次游行示威，……内战早该停止了。”说什么“光是喊一阵，跳一阵，动动笔，动动嘴是不够的”，想用他的所谓“长期性”、“建设性”的空洞口号，涣散人民的斗志，瓦解群众的反蒋运动。⑨胡适为了反对“一二九”运动，说什么“在这个大难里，一切耸听的口号标语固然都是空虚无补，就是在适当时机的一声抗议至多也不过临时补漏救弊而已。”⑩吴晗在当年忠实地执行了胡适的反动路线，这个时候，为了替蒋介石效劳，又搬出这一套来毒害人民群众。
    一九四六年八月，他在《怎么办？》一文中，要蒋介石抛点小恩小惠，做点“好事”，欺骗人民，挽救他们摇摇欲坠的统治。他说：“我要以人民的资格，奉劝国民党当局，趁今天还在位的时候，多做一点好事，即刻做，做了再说；做了而不说更好，饥者易为食，渴者易为饮，人民的满足是不费事的。……我敢保证，人民也会保证，你们只要能做到这些，完完全全的做到，是不愁人民不站在你们这一边的。”?
    吴晗怀着忧心忡忡的心情，为国民党的“前途计”，说什么“打内战的唯一后果是……逃杨归墨，为渊驱鱼，造成共产党的更强大，国民党的更没落，也是划算不来的。”?他又说：“不能再打了！”“只有这样做，才是中国人民之福，也是国民党之福。”?
    这些材料已经足够说明，吴晗的所谓反内战是害怕共产党越打越强大，国民党越打越没落。他最怕的是共产党胜利。
    说到这里，吴晗又会辩解说，我不是在一九四八年就到解放区去了吗？
    问题不在于到解放区去了没有。许多曾经染上民主个人主义思想的人们，随着人民革命战争的向前发展，对美帝国主义和国民党反动派的反动本质，逐步有所认识，对中国共产党的看法，也有所改变。对于他们的进步，人民从来是欢迎的。但是，吴晗和这些人完全相反。他是一个善观风色、见风转舵的投机政客。一九四八年下半年，人民解放战争的彻底胜利已经在望，这时候，他和罗隆基勾勾搭搭，想以民主党派头面人物的身份，干政治投机买卖，同我们党讨价还价。他虽然到了解放区，但还死抱住他的资产阶级政治野心不放。这位自称是占人口百分之九十以上的“中间阶层”的代表，对于共产党的领导，并不心甘情愿，他进了解放区以后，“看见了‘毛主席万岁’这些口号，心里有点不习惯，总觉得何必也来‘万岁’这一套。”?吴晗就是混进革命阵营的脑后带有反骨的一个人物。
    就在吴晗进入解放区以后不久，毛泽东同志在一九四九年的新年献词——《将革命进行到底》中，就已经指出，随着解放战争在全国范围内的胜利，中国反动派和美国侵略者一天比一天地重视政治斗争的方法，他们“正在设计使用某些既同中国反动派和美国侵略者有联系，又同革命阵营有联系的人们，向他们进行挑拨和策动，叫他们好生工作，力求混入革命阵营，构成革命阵营中的所谓反对派，以便保存反动势力，破坏革命势力。……这种情形，现在许多人还没有看清楚，但是大约不要很久，人们就可以看得清楚了。”?吴晗在五十年代末、六十年代初，终于公开暴露了他的反党反社会主义的反共老手的真面目，再一次证明了毛泽东同志的英明预见。
    反党反社会主义的政治纲领
    为国民党反动派的罪恶统治出谋献策，为美帝国主义指引的第三条道路狂热宣传的一杆反共、反人民、反革命的黑枪，突然在一九五九年重新抛了出来，“旧枪新投”，这是为什么？
    必须从当时阶级斗争的背景上来考察这个问题。
    一九五九年的夏天，正是我国社会主义革命同资本主义复辟的两条道路尖锐斗争的时刻，革命的群众，按照党所指明的方向，高举总路线的伟大红旗，坚持大跃进、坚持人民公社，坚决走社会主义的道路。人民群众伟大的革命创举，使一切反对社会主义革命的反动力量恐慌万状。代表资本主义复辟力量的右倾机会主义分子即修正主义者，利用自然灾害给我们造成的困难和我们某些前进中的缺点，猖狂向党发动进攻。在这场进攻中，隐藏在人民革命阵营中的吴晗，迫不及待地上阵，充当了反党、反社会主义的急先锋。
    发表在一九五九年六月的《海瑞骂皇帝》和一九六一年一月的《海瑞罢官》，代表了吴晗反党反人民的活动的两个阶段。《投枪集》，出版在《海瑞骂皇帝》之后，《海瑞罢官》之前。吴晗在紧张的一“骂”二“罢”之间，匆忙整理出版他的旧作，这不是偶然的。
    如果说，《海瑞骂皇帝》是为右倾机会主义分子向党发动猖狂进攻擂鼓助威，《海瑞罢官》是为被人民“罢”了“官”的右倾机会主义分子翻案，鼓励他们东山再起，而出版在这两棵大毒草之间的《投枪集》，则是利用他四十年代的杂文，为右倾机会主义分子提供资本主义复辟的反动政治纲领。这是用四十年代历史作烟幕，向党投出的一杆恶毒的黑枪。
    一九五九年七月六日，吴晗为《投枪集》出版写的“前言”里说，我的文章“都是有的放矢的”。这就是说，他出版《投枪集》，不是无的放矢，而是有的放矢的。
    什么“的”？这“的”就是党的领导，就是社会主义制度，就是无产阶级专政。
    请看，这本书里的“枪”：
    “和历史上比较，‘家天下’变成‘党政府’，政府属于一人一党，财富尊荣威权属于一人一党”。?
      “我们不能不指出，特别指出，人民的要求是废止一党专政。”“党和政分开，更和国分开。收起以党治国的招牌，……不但退出各级政府，也退出工厂，退出学校，退出铁路、邮局、银行、一切国家机构。”“实行还政于民，政党不再直接统治人民。”?
    “你们所喜欢的一党专政，……我们也是深恶痛绝的。在你们的立场是‘民之所好不好之’，我们人民呢，‘政府之所恶深喜之’。政府和人民的对立，在这场合上，还不够显明吗？”?
    谁都知道，在国家与革命的问题上，是阶级对阶级的斗争，是阶级对阶级的专政。不是人民专反动派的政，就是反动派专人民的政，中间道路是没有的。吴晗的这些话，就在四十年代也是从美国贩来的虚伪的资产阶级民主政治，而在一九五九年，吴晗不加任何批判和说明，重新发表这些东西，则是利用它来作为反党、反社会主义、反无产阶级专政的武器，把它作为复辟资本主义的反动纲领。
    用吴晗的话说，这就叫“指桑骂槐”。
    甚至吴晗把他过去直接骂共产党的话也照样搬出来了。什么“人民受罪，结怨于人民是不会有什么好处的”，什么“好战分子”，什么共产党不代表人民利益，只代表“党派利益”等等，所有这些反动透顶的东西，都拿出来了。图穷匕见。吴晗反共、反人民、反革命的面目，在这里暴露无遗了。
    这里也可以看到，那些包庇吴晗的人是站在什么立场上？
    吴晗攻击党，攻击社会主义，攻击无产阶级专政的目的，是要推翻党领导的人民国家，企图在中国实现资本主义制度，建立资产阶级专政的国家。
    他公然号召人们为在中国实现资本主义政治制度，实现“自由世界”而奋斗。公然号召人们走美国的道路。
    “我们要建设真正的民主政治，自由世界”。?
      “我们得学学美国人民（注意：这人民是假的）的民主方式，美国的政府是全世界所公认的合法政府，因为这政府是由美国人民选举出来的。”?
    “欧美一些国家人民所已经享受的正是我们今天所争取的，如思想言论身体出版旅行等自由，如选举权，如议会政治。”?
    吴晗所要争取的就是这些货色，包庇吴晗的人，你们所要争取的，又是什么呢？
    借四十年代的政治杂文，提出一个取消无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的反动政治纲领。这就是吴晗为什么要在右倾机会主义分子即修正主义者猖狂向党发动进攻的时刻，迫不及待地抛出他的《投枪集》的真正居心。这是一个卑鄙的政治阴谋。
    一切反动派总是错误地估计形势。总是过高地估计自己的力量，过低地估计党和人民的力量。吴晗也不例外。一九五九年的夏天，中国的天空上出现了几片乌云，他就以为时机来到了，急急忙忙地投出了他那杆破烂不堪的黑枪，以梦呓般的语言，疯狂地为资本主义制度呼喊。他万万没有想到，事情走向了他的反面，到头来，这杆黑枪恰恰投中了他自己，正是这杆黑枪，戳穿了他“民主斗士”的画皮，暴露了他媚美、仇共的黑心肠。
    毒草不可怕，锄了好肥田。我们郑重地向大家推荐吴晗的《投枪集》，希望人们，特别是年青的一代，认真地耐心地读一读这本书，看一看混入革命阵营的反共知识分子，是怎样同我们进行斗争的。这是一部难得的反面教材，读了它，可以增长见识，提高同阶级敌人进行斗争的本领。
