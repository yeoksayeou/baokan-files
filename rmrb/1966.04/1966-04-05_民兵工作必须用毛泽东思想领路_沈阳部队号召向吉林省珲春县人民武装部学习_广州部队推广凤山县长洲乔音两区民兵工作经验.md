    (Xinhua News Agency, Changchun) The People's Armed Forces Department of Hunchun County, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, an advanced unit in Jilin Province in studying Chairman Mao's works and rated as a "Four-Good" Armed Forces Department for four consecutive years, under the leadership of the county party committee, puts the leadership of militiamen in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as the top priority in all work, and as the foundation for realizing the "three implementations" of militia work, effectively promoting the grassroots construction of the militia.

    The leading organs of the Shenyang Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice calling on all levels of armed forces departments and all armed forces cadres under its jurisdiction to carry out activities to learn from the People's Armed Forces Department of Hunchun County, in conjunction with the implementation of Vice Chairman Lin Biao's five principles on continuing to give prominence to politics and the spirit of the All-Army Political Work Conference.

    The People's Armed Forces Department of Hunchun County began to vigorously organize militiamen to study Chairman Mao's works in 1964. Based on past practical experience, they gradually realized that militia work must be guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Only by arming the minds of the broad masses of militiamen with Mao Zedong Thought, and commanding military affairs with politics, can we strengthen militia construction and fundamentally guarantee the realization of the "three implementations" of militia work. All the twenty-odd cadres in the entire armed forces department consciously act as propagandists, organizers, and tutors for the militiamen in studying Chairman Mao's works, going deep into the grassroots, publicizing wherever they go, and helping wherever they go. Wu Huichen, the head of the armed forces department, while participating in local central work in Liushuhezi Brigade of Madida Commune at the beginning of last year, used his spare time to prepare materials, understand the learning situation and ideological problems of the militiamen, and tutored the militiamen in studying Chairman Mao's works platoon by platoon, working from dawn till dusk. Cui Hanying, a cadre from the political work section, when learning about militia work in Chunhua Commune, found that the militia companies were studying Chairman Mao's theses on the people's war. He seized the time to tutor the militiamen while understanding the situation, and gave tutoring reports to nine militia companies in the ten days he was in the countryside. Chen Yuanfeng, a staff officer from the mobilization section, often paid attention to reading tutorial reference materials on studying Chairman Mao's works in books, newspapers, and periodicals, and collected materials that were enlightening to the grassroots militiamen, carrying them with him to introduce the experience of studying Chairman Mao's works to the militiamen anytime, anywhere.

    In organizing the militiamen to study Chairman Mao's works, the People's Armed Forces Department of Hunchun County, according to the characteristics of the militiamen being numerous, widespread, and scattered, established study counselors in the militia platoons to help the militiamen study. When the cadres of the armed forces department went to the countryside, they made it one of their important tasks to help these counselors improve their tutoring abilities. Huo Fengyou, a staff officer from the training section, saw in the militia company of Liushuhezi Brigade of Madida Commune that the counselor was reading the book when tutoring the militiamen in studying "Serve the People," and the effect was not great. He then, through living and working with the militiamen, compiled the good people and good deeds of the militiamen loving production and caring for the collective that he saw, and gave the militiamen another tutorial report on "Serve the People," which linked the militiamen's study of theory with reality, both teaching the counselor how to work and improving the militiamen's enthusiasm for study. They also firmly grasped typical examples, set up models, and promoted learning experience.

    The People's Armed Forces Department of Hunchun County has wholeheartedly led and organized the militiamen to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, which has powerfully promoted the ideological revolutionization of the militiamen and the "three implementations" of militia work. Many grassroots militia units have already made reading Chairman Mao's books the central content of militia activities. Under the slogan "How Chairman Mao said it, I will do it," the broad masses of militiamen have played an important role in participating in collective production, water conservancy construction, farmland capital construction, and flood fighting and disaster relief; military training has also achieved great success.

    (Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 4th) The militiamen of Changzhou and Qiaoyin districts in Fengshan County, Guangxi, regard studying Chairman Mao's works as the fundamental way to strengthen the construction of the people's armed forces, and actively carry out mass activities of creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Their mental outlook has undergone profound changes. The militiamen are determined to act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions in all aspects, take the lead in production, and become shock troops in transforming the world, building the socialist mountainous areas even more beautifully; in militia work, they will resolutely implement the "three implementations" and turn the mountainous areas into an impregnable fortress.

    The Party Committee of the Guangzhou Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice introducing the experience of the militiamen and masses of Changzhou and Qiaoyin districts in Fengshan County, Guangxi, in creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and called on all levels of armed forces departments and the broad masses of militiamen to carry out activities of learning from Fengshan, catching up with Fengshan, and surpassing Fengshan.

    Not long ago, the Guangxi Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a site meeting here to promote their experience.

    Changzhou and Qiaoyin districts are remote mountainous areas, scattered with Zhuang, Han, Yao and other fraternal ethnic groups. Before liberation, the people here suffered cruel oppression and exploitation from the Kuomintang reactionaries and landlords and bullies, and their suffering was profound. After liberation, they became the masters of the country, production developed, their lives gradually improved, and they had boundless love for the Party and Chairman Mao. In 1962, under the influence of the People's Liberation Army and the masses of various places studying Chairman Mao's works, a few people in the militia had already begun to read Chairman Mao's books automatically. In the spring of 1963, after Chairman Mao issued the great call to "Learn from Comrade Lei Feng," Lei Feng's tall image and his path of growth gave the militiamen great inspiration. Everyone was determined to creatively study and apply Chairman Mao's works like Lei Feng, and gradually pushed the activity of studying Chairman Mao's works to a climax.

    In the past two years, the militiamen of these two districts have improved their ideological awareness through creatively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and understood that farming and being a militiaman are both doing revolution, and have played a huge role in production and construction and militia construction. They dare to be pioneers in production, and with the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and striving for progress, they lead the masses to carry out the struggle to control mountains and rivers and transform the world. Since 1963, the militiamen of the two districts have taken the lead in building hundreds of small-scale water conservancy projects, creating thousands of mu of forests, and reclaiming large areas of wasteland. The location of the Second Team of Jiujia Commune used to be a place where "there would be drought after seven days without rain, and floods after one day of rain," and there were disasters every year. Since 1964, the militiamen here have led the masses to dig canals to divert water and build water conservancy projects, turning 80% of the "hope-for-rain fields" into "water-conserving fields." Once, the brick kiln door of the Thirteenth Team of Changzhou Commune collapsed, and every militiaman in the team took Zhang Side as an example, braving the high temperature to participate in the rush repair. They fought hard for three hours and repaired the collapsed kiln door.

    The militiamen have studied Chairman Mao's theses on class and class struggle, understood that the aggressive nature of imperialism will not change and that we must also sharpen our knives when the enemy sharpens theirs, improved their awareness of building the people's armed forces, and realized the "three implementations" of militia work. Now the militia organizations here are sound and the activities are regular. They actively practice martial arts, practice in the mountains near the mountains, practice in the water when there is water, practice thinking, practice style, practice physical strength, and learn shooting, bayonet, throwing grenades, swimming and other techniques. They make their own equipment when there is not enough, and learn automatically when there are no instructors. Two militia cadres from Changzhou Commune went to the county to receive guns and saw the county public security team practicing bayonet, so they carefully watched the movements and came back to teach the militia to practice. They have established a solid people's defense line in the mountainous areas, and can be summoned at any time with an order. While actively participating in martial arts training, the broad masses of female militiamen also thought that once there is a war, male militiamen will go to the front line, and female militiamen will be responsible for heavy production work in the rear, so they have been learning how to plow and harrow, preparing to undertake production tasks. The militiamen firmly said: "We have made preparations to defend ourselves, and if the enemy dares to come, we will let it have no return." (Attached picture)

    Zhang Wanming, the squad leader of the "Red Sharp Knife Company," and the militiamen read quotations from Chairman Mao together to study the meaning of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

    民兵工作必须用毛泽东思想领路
    沈阳部队号召向吉林省珲春县人民武装部学习
    广州部队推广凤山县长洲乔音两区民兵工作经验
    据新华社长春电　吉林省学习毛主席著作先进单位、连续四年被评为四好武装部的延边朝鲜族自治州珲春县人民武装部，在县委的领导下，把领导民兵活学活用毛主席著作摆在一切工作的首位，作为实现民兵工作三落实的根本，有效地促进了民兵基层建设。
    中国人民解放军沈阳部队领导机关最近发出通知，号召所属各级武装部门和全体武装干部，结合贯彻林彪副主席提出的关于继续突出政治的五项原则和全军政治工作会议精神，开展向珲春县人民武装部学习的活动。
    珲春县人民武装部，大力组织民兵学习毛主席著作是从一九六四年开始的。他们根据过去的实践经验，逐步认识到民兵工作必须用毛泽东思想领路。只有用毛泽东思想武装广大民兵的头脑，以政治统帅军事，才是加强民兵建设、实现民兵工作三落实的根本保证。整个武装部的二十几名干部，人人自觉地当民兵学习毛主席著作的宣传员、组织员、辅导员，深入基层，走到哪里就宣传到哪里，帮助到哪里。武装部长吴会臣，去年年初在马滴达公社柳树河子大队参加地方中心工作期间，起早贪黑利用业余时间，准备材料，了解民兵学习情况和思想问题，一个排一个排地辅导民兵学习毛主席著作。政工科干事崔汉英，到春化公社了解民兵工作时，各民兵连正在学习毛主席人民战争思想的论述，他就边了解情况，边抓紧时间给民兵作辅导，下乡十天，就给九个民兵连做了辅导报告。动员科参谋陈元凤，经常注意阅读书报刊物上有关学习毛主席著作的辅导参考材料，并把一些对基层民兵有启发作用的材料搜集起来，带在身上，随时随地向民兵介绍学习毛主席著作的经验。
    珲春县人民武装部在组织民兵学习毛主席著作中，根据民兵人多、面广、分散的特点，在民兵排设立了学习辅导员，帮助民兵学习。武装部的干部下乡，就把帮助这些辅导员提高辅导能力，作为自己重要任务之一。作训科参谋霍凤有，在马滴达公社柳树河子大队民兵连，看到辅导员在辅导民兵学习《为人民服务》时照本念，效果不大。他就通过和民兵一起生活、一起劳动，把看到的民兵热爱生产、关心集体的好人好事汇集起来，给民兵们重新作了一次《为人民服务》的辅导报告，使民兵学习理论和实际联系了起来，既教会辅导员工作办法，又提高了民兵的学习热情。他们还狠抓典型，树立样板，推广学习经验。
    珲春县人民武装部全力领导和组织民兵活学活用毛主席著作，有力地促进了民兵的思想革命化和民兵工作三落实。许多基层民兵单位已经把读毛主席的书，作为民兵活动的中心内容。广大民兵在“毛主席怎样说的，我就怎样做”的口号下，在参加集体生产、兴修水利、农田基本建设、抗洪抢险等方面，发挥了重要作用；军事训练也取得了很大的成就。
    据新华社南宁四日电　广西凤山县长洲、乔音两个区的民兵，把学习毛主席著作作为加强人民武装建设的根本途径，积极开展群众性的活学活用毛主席著作活动，精神面貌发生了深刻的变化。民兵们决心处处照毛主席指示办事，在生产上打头阵，当改天换地的突击手，把社会主义的山区建设得更加美好；在民兵工作上坚决贯彻三落实，把山区变成铜墙铁壁。
    中国人民解放军广州部队党委最近发出通知，介绍广西凤山县长洲、乔音两个区的民兵和群众活学活用毛主席著作的经验，并且号召各级武装部门和广大民兵，开展学凤山、赶凤山、超凤山的活动。
    不久前，中国人民解放军广西军区在这里召开现场会议，推广他们的经验。
    长洲、乔音两区，是偏僻的山区，散居着壮、汉、瑶等兄弟民族。解放前，这里的人民备受国民党反动派和地主、恶霸的残酷压迫和剥削，苦难深重。解放后，他们做了国家的主人，生产发展了，生活逐步上升，对党和毛主席无限热爱。一九六二年，在人民解放军和各地群众学习毛主席著作的影响下，民兵中已有少数人自动地开始读毛主席的书。一九六三年春，毛主席发出“向雷锋同志学习”的伟大号召后，雷锋高大的形象及其成长的道路给了民兵很大启示。大家决心象雷锋那样活学活用毛主席著作，并且逐步把学习毛主席著作的活动推向高潮。
    两年多来，这两个区的民兵通过活学活用毛主席著作，提高了思想觉悟，懂得了种田、当民兵都是干革命，在生产建设和民兵建设中发挥了巨大的作用。他们在生产上勇于当闯将，以自力更生、奋发图强的革命精神，带动群众开展治山治水，改天换地的斗争。从一九六三年以来，两个区的民兵带头修筑了数以百计的小型水利，营造了上千亩林木，开垦了大片荒田。久加公社第二队所在地，过去是个“七天不雨成旱，下雨一日成涝”的地方，年年有灾。一九六四年以来，这里的民兵带动群众，开渠引水，兴修水利，把百分之八十的“望天田”，改成了“保水田”。长洲公社十三队的砖窑门有一次烧塌了，队里的民兵个个以张思德为榜样，冒着高温，参加抢修，他们奋战三小时，就把烧塌的窑门抢修好。
    民兵们学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，懂得了帝国主义的侵略本性不会改变和敌人磨刀我们也要磨刀的道理，提高了建设人民武装的自觉性，实现了民兵工作三落实。现在这里民兵组织健全，活动经常。他们积极练武，靠山练山，有水练水，练思想，练作风，练体力，学习射击、刺杀、投弹、游泳等技术。器材不够自己做，没有教员自动学。长洲公社两个民兵干部到县领枪，看到县公安队练刺杀，就细心观摩动作，回来教民兵练。他们在山区建立起巩固的人民防线，一声令下，都能召之即来。广大女民兵在积极参加练武的同时，还想到一旦有战争，男民兵要上前线，后方要女民兵担负生产重活，就纷纷地学犁学耙，准备承担生产任务。民兵们坚定地说：“我们已经作好了自己保卫自己的准备，敌人敢来，就叫它有来无回。”（附图片）
    “红色尖兵连”班长张万明和民兵们同读毛主席语录，学习“枪杆子里面出政权”的意义。
