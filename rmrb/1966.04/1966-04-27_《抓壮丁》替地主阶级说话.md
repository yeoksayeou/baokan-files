    "The Song of Ouyang Hai" readers will certainly remember that when Ouyang Hai was born, the disaster of "one in two recruits" was imminent, and they dared not call out the boy's name, but changed it to a "girl's name" - Ouyang Yurong. But later, his family not only owed one hundred and twenty piculs of grain as "recruiting donation," but even his elder brother could not be kept and was taken away.
    Comrades who have seen the clay sculpture "Rent Collection Courtyard" will recall the scene of "forcing rent," where the peasant was bound and taken away by fierce thugs because he could not pay enough rent. This is a tragic scene of parting, death, and family ruin.
    This is the true picture of recruiting in the old society. Recruiting, in essence, was the landlord class recruiting the peasants. They took the peasants to fight internal wars for Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary regime, to fight against the People's Army led by the Communist Party, to be cannon fodder for the Chiang bandits, and to be scapegoats. This was a very cruel political oppression of the peasant masses by the landlord class. Not only that, but this was also a particularly heavy economic exploitation of the peasants by the landlord class and the Kuomintang regime. Accompanying the recruiting system were all sorts of "recruiting donations," which was another blood-sucking tube extended to the peasants. When recruiting, the Bao chiefs and village guards always took the opportunity to pocket some money, and invariably extorted the peasants for their own benefit. In short, the victims of recruiting could only be the peasants, especially the poor peasants. Recruiting caused countless poor peasants to lose their families and become separated from their wives and children. These are ironclad facts that no one can deny.
    However, in the film "The Recruiting," what we see is Wang Baochang, representing the Kuomintang regime, and Captain Lu recruiting from the landlord Li Laoshan's family. Look, Li Laoshan's eldest son is away and hasn't been heard from for two or three years, so Wang Baochang comes to recruit his third son; the Li family paid three thousand yuan to become a cadet and barely escaped. Now Wang Baochang has drawn Li Laoshan's second son... it seems that whenever recruiting comes, it always falls on Li Laoshan. Today he recruits this one, tomorrow he recruits that one. Recruiting isn't enough, Wang Baochang takes the opportunity to extort a large sum, taking away the one thousand yuan that Li Laoshan just received. Then, Wang Baochang deceives him out of the two thousand yuan sent back by his eldest son, and in turn lends high-interest loans to Li Laoshan. This forces Li Laoshan to hide everywhere, afraid to show his face. Finally, Wang Baochang even took the opportunity to insult Li Laoshan's daughter-in-law. The Li Laoshan family suffered so many misfortunes and such great losses, and almost lost both their wealth and their people. In a word, the suffering of recruiting, a class oppression and class exploitation, actually fell on the head of the landlord Li Laoshan. The film is telling people that the recruiting experience of the landlord Li Laoshan and the poor peasant Jiang Guofu's family is not essentially different, but only in degree. The Kuomintang reactionary regime is not only irreconcilable with the peasants, but also with landlords like Li Laoshan. Wang Baochang not only does not serve Li Laoshan diligently, but instead only bullies and insults him. The suffering of recruiting experienced by poor peasants is all present in the landlord Li Laoshan's case as well.
    Is the film's portrayal of recruiting like this realistic? Is the film's reflection of the countryside under the rule of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary regime tolerable? We know that the landlord class is the foundation of the Kuomintang reactionary regime, and the reactionary regime is the landlord's political backing. They eat from the same pot, sit on the same bench, and wear the same pants. The landlord grasps the rural political power, military power, and financial power in his hands. They have money, power, and influence, so even if there are ten brothers, eight brothers in the family, they will not be recruited. Bao chiefs and village guards are merely the ferocious watchdogs raised by the landlords; they will only bark at the poor and dare not bite their masters. We must ask the directors, why don't you expose these things? Why do you fabricate lies and fictional stories to exonerate the landlord Li Laoshan's crimes of oppressing and exploiting the peasants? Why do you portray Li Laoshan as pitiful? Is it that the Kuomintang local regime and the landlord are not of the same mind and colluding with each other, but rather enemies?
    We must also ask the directors, why don't you describe the oppression and exploitation suffered by poor peasants? Why not write their history of blood and tears? Why not be the spokesperson for the poor peasants and denounce the evil old society? Why be the spokesperson for the landlords and speak for the landlord class?
    Is it that Wang Baochang recruited the wrong people, or that the directors took the wrong stand?
    We believe that the directors of "The Recruiting" want to use the fictional recruiting of the landlord to replace the living, bloody reality of the landlord class recruiting the peasants; they want the audience to shed tears of sympathy for the landlord Li Laoshan, generate compassion, and forget that the landlord is our class enemy; they want to use the vivid descriptions of the dog-eat-dog quarrels of the landlords to erase our hatred of the landlord class; they want to use vulgar and low-level jokes to make the audience dizzy and abandon the proletarian class stance. The film directors' intentions are very malicious; they are speaking for the landlord class and serving the landlord class.
    We want to shout loudly to the directors of "The Recruiting": No matter how you beautify and cover up for the landlord class, speak for them, and cry out for their grievances, we will never be fooled by you! We will fight to the end against all anti-Party and anti-socialist demons and monsters!

### 《抓壮丁》替地主阶级说话

    《抓壮丁》替地主阶级说话	中国人民大学语言文学系学生　罗文荣
    读过《欧阳海之歌》的读者一定会记得，欧阳海刚生下来，就因“两丁抽一”的大祸临头，不敢叫出男孩的名字，而改叫个“丫头名字”——欧阳玉蓉。但后来，他家不仅欠下了一百二十石谷的“壮丁捐”，就连大哥终于还是保不住，被抓走。
    看过泥塑《收租院》的同志都会想得起“逼租”的场面，那个农民因交不够租子被凶神恶煞的狗腿子五花大绑地抓走了。这是一幕生离死别、家破人亡的惨剧。
    这就是旧社会抓壮丁的真实写照。抓壮丁，实质上就是地主阶级抓农民的丁。他们把农民抓去给蒋介石反动政权打内战，同共产党领导下的人民军队打仗，替蒋匪当炮灰，做替死鬼。这是地主阶级对农民群众的一种十分残酷的政治压迫。不仅如此，这也是地主阶级和国民党政权对农民实行的一种特别惨重的经济剥削。伴随抓丁制度而来的，就有巧立名目的“壮丁捐”，这是伸向农民身上的又一条吸血管。抓丁时保长乡丁们总是少不了要捞一把，免不了要敲竹杠饱其私囊的，这照例是针对农民的。总之，抓壮丁的受害者只能是农民，尤其是贫苦农民。抓壮丁使得无数的贫苦农民倾家荡产、妻离子散。铁一般的事实，谁也休想否定掉。
    但是，在影片《抓壮丁》里，我们看到的却是代表着国民党政权的王保长、芦队长在抓地主李老栓家的丁。你看，李老栓的大儿子在外，两三年杳无音信，王保长就来抓他的三儿子的丁；李家出了三千块钱当上童子军，才幸免于难。现在王保长又抽到老二的身上……，真是一抽起壮丁来，就抽在李老栓的身上。今天抽这个，明天抽那个。抓人不算，王保长又乘机大敲竹杠，拿走李老栓刚到手的一千块钱。接着，王保长又骗走大儿子寄回来的两千块钱，反过来放李老栓的高利贷。逼得李老栓东藏西躲，不敢露面。最后，王保长还借机污辱了李老栓的儿媳妇。李老栓一家遭受了这么多的横祸，受到了这么大的损失，甚至差一点闹个人财两空。一句话，抓壮丁这种阶级压迫、阶级剥削的苦难，竟然也落到了地主李老栓的头上。影片是在告诉人们：地主李老栓和贫农姜国富一家的被抓丁的遭遇，并没有本质的差别，而只是轻重之分。国民党反动政权，不仅和农民势不两立，而且也和李老栓这样的地主不共戴天。王保长不仅不为李老栓效劳卖力，反而尽来欺侮作贱李老栓。贫苦农民所受抓壮丁的苦难，在地主李老栓那里也是应有尽有。
    影片这样来表现抓壮丁，难道是真实的么？影片这样来反映蒋介石反动政权统治下的农村，难道是能够容忍的么？我们知道，地主阶级是国民党反动政权的墙脚，而反动政权则是地主的政治靠山。他们吃的是一锅饭，坐的是一条板凳，穿的是一条裤子。地主把农村的政权、军权、财权一把抓在手。他们有钱有权有势，所以，尽管家里有十兄八弟也不会被抓丁。保长、乡丁，只是地主豢养的凶恶的看家狗，他们只会向着穷人狂吠，决不敢咬自己的主子。我们要责问编导者，你们为什么不去揭露这些呢？你们为什么要编造谎言、虚构故事，为地主李老栓开脱压迫剥削农民的罪行？为什么要把李老栓也写得可怜巴巴？难道国民党的地方政权和地主不是一个鼻孔出气、狼狈为奸，反而是冤家对头？
    我们还要责问编导者，你们为什么不去描写贫苦农民所受的压迫和剥削？不写他们的血泪史？为什么不当贫苦农民的代言人，去控诉万恶的旧社会？而去当地主的代言人，替地主阶级说话呢？
    究竟是王保长抓错了丁呢，还是编导者站错了立场？
    我们认为，《抓壮丁》的编导者就是要以虚构的抓地主的丁，来代替地主阶级抓农民的丁这种活生生的血的现实；就是要让观众对地主李老栓一洒同情之泪，产生怜悯之心，而忘记地主是我们的阶级敌人；就是要以对地主狗咬狗的争吵的绘声绘色的描写，来磨灭我们对地主阶级的仇恨；要用庸俗低级的笑料，使观众昏昏然，而放弃无产阶级的阶级立场。影片编导者的用意是十分恶毒的，它是替地主阶级说话，为地主阶级服务的。
    我们要对《抓壮丁》的编导者们大喝一声：不管你们怎样为地主阶级粉饰掩盖，为他们帮腔张目，为他们喊冤叫苦，我们决不上你们的当，我们要同一切反党反社会主义的牛鬼蛇神斗争到底！
