    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 8th - The Vietnamese *People's Daily* published a commentary on April 8th, pointing out that imperialism headed by the United States and the reactionary forces in Indonesia are conspiring to turn Indonesia into a pro-imperialist country.

    The commentary stated that the new Indonesian authorities recently indicated their intention to implement a foreign policy of friendliness towards imperialism. On April 4th, they declared that Indonesia might have "closer relations with the United States" and hoped to receive economic aid from the United States. They also said that Indonesia "is always open to a peaceful solution to the Malaysia issue." The US State Department immediately expressed "welcome" to this statement by the new Indonesian authorities on the same day.

    The commentary said that since October 1965, US imperialism has repeatedly thrown out the bait of "aid," attempting to woo Indonesia to follow the United States. On March 14, 1966, immediately after the Indonesian reactionary military forces coerced President Sukarno to hand over power to Suharto and Suharto ordered the banning of the Indonesian Communist Party, the United States immediately announced that it would be ready to give Indonesia "economic assistance" at any time.

    The commentary said that British Foreign Secretary Stewart expressed his welcome on March 14 to the coup by pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia. The Japanese authorities are also attempting to use economic "aid" as bait to infiltrate Indonesia and woo Indonesia to follow imperialism.

    The commentary pointed out that it is very clear that imperialism headed by the United States and the reactionary forces in Indonesia are conspiring to turn Indonesia into a pro-imperialist country.

    The commentary stated that the Indonesian people's long-standing policy of opposing imperialism, neo-colonialism and old colonialism, and opposing "Malaysia" is in line with the interests of the Indonesian people, the people of Southeast Asian countries, and peace. The people of all countries strongly oppose all the conspiracies of US imperialism and its lackeys.

    越《人民报》谴责印度尼西亚右派和帝国主义勾结
    美帝国主义和日本反动派大举渗入印度尼西亚
    新华社河内八日电　越南《人民报》八日发表评论指出，以美国为首的帝国主义和印度尼西亚的反动势力正在阴谋把印度尼西亚变为亲帝国主义的国家。
    评论说，印度尼西亚新当局最近表示，要实行同帝国主义亲善的对外政策。他们在四月四日宣称，印度尼西亚可能“同美国有更密切的关系”并且希望接受美国的经济援助。他们还说，印度尼西亚“时刻为和平解决马来西亚问题敞开大门”。美国国务院在同一天对印度尼西亚新当局的这一言论马上表示“欢迎”。
    评论说，自从一九六五年十月份以来，美帝国主义曾多次抛出“援助”诱饵，企图拉拢印度尼西亚追随美国。一九六六年三月十四日，即在印度尼西亚反动军事势力胁迫苏加诺总统把权力交给苏哈托和苏哈托下令取缔印度尼西亚共产党之后，美国立即宣布将随时准备给印度尼西亚以“经济援助”。
    评论说，英国外交大臣斯图尔特三月十四日表示欢迎印度尼西亚亲美反动势力的政变。日本当局也妄图利用经济“援助”为诱饵渗入印度尼西亚，拉拢印度尼西亚追随帝国主义。
    评论指出，很显然，以美国为首的帝国主义和印度尼西亚的反动势力正在阴谋把印度尼西亚变成为亲帝国主义的国家。
    评论说，印度尼西亚人民长期以来执行的反对帝国主义、新老殖民主义和反对“马来西亚”的政策，是符合印度尼西亚人民、东南亚各国人民以及和平的利益的。各国人民强烈反对美帝国主义及其走狗的一切阴谋。
