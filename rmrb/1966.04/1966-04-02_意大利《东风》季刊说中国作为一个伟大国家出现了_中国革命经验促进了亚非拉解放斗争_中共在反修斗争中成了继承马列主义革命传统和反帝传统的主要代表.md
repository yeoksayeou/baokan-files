    Xinhua News Agency, 1st—An editorial published in the inaugural issue of the Italian quarterly "East Wind" not long ago pointed out that China has emerged as a great nation, and China and the Chinese Communist Party have become the main representatives inheriting the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary tradition and anti-imperialist tradition.
    The editorial said, "After liberation, the people's regime needed to solve many major problems and overcome many difficulties in China: the chaos and poverty left over by the old regime and a century of foreign rule, the sabotage of counter-revolutionaries and the resistance of the old privileged classes, especially the offensive of imperialism, which was unwilling to lose the largest fortress on the Asian continent. This offensive continues to this day, occupying Taiwan, supporting the Chiang Kai-shek puppet regime, implementing economic blockades, diplomatically refusing to recognize China, excluding China from its seat in the United Nations, and carrying out military encirclement based on the so-called 'containment' principle."
    The editorial said, "Contrary to the expectations of the enemy, China has very successfully withstood the various tests it has faced, and today the People's Republic of China, after more than a century of decline, has emerged again as a great nation; in terms of its economic achievements, social progress, technological and cultural achievements, political stability, administrative effectiveness and the defensive capabilities of its army, China is at the forefront of Asian countries.
    "The consistency of the policies between action and thought followed by New China in its domestic and foreign policies has won it the sympathy of the broad masses and governments of all countries wherever there is class exploitation and national oppression in the world. China's revolutionary experience has promoted the liberation wars in Vietnam, Cuba, and Algeria and the ongoing struggles in other countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America."
    The editorial continued, "Just as great China as a socialist country is growing into a world power, the consequences of the ideological and political degeneration that has occurred in the Soviet state and the Soviet Communist Party have been very clearly exposed, and this degeneration has gradually led them to lose their role as encouragers of revolutionary struggles and national liberation struggles in the world.
    "China and the Chinese Communist Party—who have been consolidated in the work of building and developing their own country and in supporting the cause of oppressed peoples and countries—in the struggle against this degeneration, have become the main representatives inheriting the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary tradition and the anti-imperialist tradition, and have become a spokesperson playing a very important role in a worldwide team."
    The editorial said, "The urgent need to provide information about China in all aspects is commensurate with the country's growing importance in the world and the country's new political and social experience." The editorial pointed out that the purpose of publishing "East Wind" magazine is to enable Italians to learn more about China. The editorial said that the magazine's name "East Wind" is quoted from an ancient Chinese saying borrowed by Mao Zedong.

    意大利《东风》季刊说中国作为一个伟大国家出现了
    中国革命经验促进了亚非拉解放斗争
    中共在反修斗争中成了继承马列主义革命传统和反帝传统的主要代表
    新华社一日讯　不久前出版的意大利《东风》季刊创刊号刊登的一篇序言指出，中国作为一个伟大的国家出现了，中国和中国共产党已成为继承马列主义革命传统和反帝传统的主要代表。
    序言说，“解放后，人民政权需要解决中国许多重大问题，克服许多困难：旧政权和一个世纪的外国统治所遗留下来的混乱和贫困、反革命的破坏和旧特权阶级的抵抗，特别是不甘心失去亚洲大陆最大堡垒的帝国主义的进攻。这种进攻迄今仍在继续，霸占台湾，支持蒋介石傀儡政权，实行经济封锁，外交上不承认中国，排除中国在联合国的席位，根据所谓‘遏制’原则进行军事包围。”
    序言说，“与敌人的期待相反，中国极成功地经受住了它面临的各种考验，今天中华人民共和国，经过一个多世纪的衰落之后又作为一个伟大的国家出现了；就其经济成就、社会进步、技术和文化成就、政治稳定、行政管理的有效性和军队的防御能力来说，中国已处于亚洲国家的首位。
    “新中国在对内和对外政策方面所遵循的行动和思想之间的政策一贯性使它在世界上凡是有阶级剥削和民族压迫的地方赢得了广大群众和各国政府的同情。中国的革命经验促进了越南、古巴、阿尔及利亚的解放战争和亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲其他国家正在进行的斗争。”
    序言接着说，“正当作为社会主义国家的伟大中国正在成长为世界强国的时候，在苏联国家和苏联共产党内出现的意识形态和政治退化的后果极明显地暴露出来了，这种退化使它们逐步丧失了作为世界上进行革命斗争和民族解放斗争的鼓励者的作用。
    “中国和中国共产党——他们在建设和发展自己国家的工作中，在支持被压迫人民和国家的事业中得到了巩固——在对这一退化进行的斗争中，成为继承马列主义革命传统和反帝传统的主要代表，并且成为一个世界性队伍的起极大作用的发言人。”
    序言说，“提供关于中国在各方面的情况的迫切要求是同这个国家在世界上日益增长的重要性和这个国家新的政治、社会经验相适应的”。序言指出，出版《东风》杂志的目的，就是使意大利人更多地了解中国。序言说，这个杂志起名《东风》是引用毛泽东借用的中国的一种古老说法。
