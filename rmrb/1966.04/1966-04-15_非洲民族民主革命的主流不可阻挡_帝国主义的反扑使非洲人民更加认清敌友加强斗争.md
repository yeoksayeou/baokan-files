    The mainstream of the African national democratic revolution is irresistible.
    Imperialist counterattacks make African people recognize friends and enemies more clearly and strengthen the struggle.
    (Xinhua News Agency, April 14) This reporter reports: When African people commemorate "Africa Freedom Day" (April 15) this year, they are engaged in a sharp and complex struggle against imperialism, led by the United States. Although imperialism has recently launched a frantic counterattack in Africa, stirring up a countercurrent, they cannot stop the mainstream of the African people's anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle.
    "Africa Freedom Day" was first proposed at the African Independent States Conference held in Accra, the capital of Ghana, in April 1958. At that time, the slogan "No interference in Africa, Africa must be free" was put forward at the meeting. The convening of this conference was the result of the vigorous development of the African national independence movement after the Bandung Conference in 1955. At the time of the Bandung Conference, there were only four independent African countries. Today, that number has increased to thirty-six, and these countries account for more than eighty percent of the area and population of the entire African continent. After shaking off the direct rule of imperialism, these countries have taken various measures to further打击打击 colonialist forces, such as implementing Africanization of cadres, Africanization of the army, confiscating land occupied by colonialists, and taking over colonialist enterprises. In countries that have not yet become independent, the road to independence through armed struggle has become increasingly popular. In 1958, only the Algerian people were engaged in armed struggle, but today, on the vast land of Angola, Mozambique, "Portuguese" Guinea, Equatorial Guinea, and in the Congo (Leopoldville) against the US puppet regime, the raging flames of people's armed struggle are burning.
    Imperialism is by no means willing to give up its colonial rule over Africa. They desperately counterattack and struggle. For African countries that have declared independence, they try every possible means to maintain their control and exploitation of these countries in various ways.
    As the African national democratic revolution deepens, these conspiracies of imperialism have become even more rampant in recent months. Last November, under the protection of British and American imperialism, the Smith colonial authorities in Southern Rhodesia illegally declared "independence," attempting to trample the four million Zimbabwean people under the feet of a minority of white colonists and turn Southern Rhodesia into a second racist-ruled South Africa. Since the end of last year, imperialism has successively instigated coups in a series of independent African countries such as Dahomey and Central Africa. This February, British and American imperialism instigated a military coup in Ghana.
    Imperialists and their followers were overjoyed by this. They believe that the direction of the wind in Africa has changed, and that the good times for them to return to Africa have arrived. However, the imperialists and their running dogs are rejoicing too soon. The temporary countercurrent created by the imperialist counterattack in Africa cannot stop the mainstream of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the people of all African countries, nor can it change the excellent revolutionary situation in Africa.
    The recent series of counterattacks launched by imperialism have played a useful role as negative teachers, promoting a new awakening among the African people. It tells people once again: Imperialism and neo-colonialism and old colonialism have not died in Africa. Countries that have achieved political independence must not listen to the fallacies spread by modern revisionism that "Asian-African colonialism has been eliminated" and that "the main task of the Asian and African people is economic construction." The African people now realize more clearly that neo-colonialism and old colonialism, headed by the United States, are still the deadly enemies of the African people. Recently, from Guinea to Tanzania, from Mali to the Congo (Brazzaville), throughout the vast African continent, alarm bells against imperialist conspiracies have been ringing everywhere.
    Facts show that the imperialist counterattack has not frightened the revolutionary people who are determined to fight. On the contrary, it has aroused the even stronger fighting spirit of the African people. Ghana was the first country in Black Africa to achieve independence, and the extension of the evil claws of American and British imperialism to Ghana cannot but stir up a new anti-imperialist storm in various African countries.
    Tanzanian President Nyerere said on February 28 that the revolutionary situation in Africa is excellent, and the African people must continue to carry out the African revolution. Africa does not need to panic because of the appearance of a countercurrent. Malian President Keita said on March 2 that although imperialism "seems outwardly menacing, it does not mean that those who are constantly plotting conspiracies against us are powerful. On the contrary, it proves that the political and ideological awareness of the African people has been greatly improved in recent years." Guinean President Touré said that in order to achieve victory, there is only one road, that is, the road of people's daily struggle. The imperialist offensive will accelerate the process of African history.
    In the final analysis, the imperialist counterattack has only deepened the hatred of the African people and further stimulated their anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit; it has made them more clearly distinguish between friends and enemies, strengthen unity, support each other, and strengthen the struggle.

### 非洲民族民主革命的主流不可阻挡  帝国主义的反扑使非洲人民更加认清敌友加强斗争

    非洲民族民主革命的主流不可阻挡
    帝国主义的反扑使非洲人民更加认清敌友加强斗争
    据新华社十四日讯  本社记者报道：非洲人民今年在纪念“非洲自由日”（四月十五日）的时候，正在同以美国为首的帝国主义进行着尖锐复杂的斗争。虽然帝国主义最近在非洲疯狂反扑掀起了一股逆流，但是，它们毕竟阻挡不了非洲人民反帝革命斗争的主流。
    “非洲自由日”是一九五八年四月在加纳首都阿克拉举行的非洲独立国家会议首先倡议的。当时会上提出了“不要干涉非洲，非洲必须自由”的口号。这个会议的召开是一九五五年万隆会议以后非洲民族独立运动蓬勃发展的结果。万隆会议时，非洲独立国家只有四个，今天已增加到三十六个，这些国家的面积和人口占全非洲的百分之八十以上。这些国家在摆脱了帝国主义的直接统治以后，又采取各种措施，进一步打击殖民主义势力，如实行干部非洲化、军队非洲化、没收殖民主义者霸占的土地、接管殖民主义者的企业等。在尚未独立国家中，通过武装斗争获得独立的道路越来越深入人心。在一九五八年时，只有阿尔及利亚人民在进行武装斗争，而今天，在安哥拉、莫三鼻给、“葡属”几内亚、赤道几内亚的广大土地上，以及在反对美国傀儡政权的刚果（利），都燃烧着人民武装斗争的熊熊烈火。
    帝国主义决不甘心放弃它对非洲的殖民统治。它们拼命进行反扑和挣扎。对于已经宣布独立的非洲国家，它们千方百计地用各种方式保持它对这些国家的控制和剥削。
    随着非洲民族民主革命更加深入，帝国主义的这种阴谋活动，最近几个月来更加猖狂。去年十一月，在英美帝国主义包庇下，非洲南部的南罗得西亚史密斯殖民当局非法宣布“独立”，企图把四百万津巴布韦人民踩在少数白种殖民者的脚下，把南罗得西亚变成第二个种族主义统治的南非。去年底以来，帝国主义先后在达荷美、中非等一系列非洲独立国家策动政变。今年二月，英美帝国主义又在加纳策动军事政变。
    帝国主义及其追随者为此兴高采烈。他们认为非洲的风向变了，他们重返非洲的好时光到来了。但是，帝国主义及其走狗高兴得太早了。帝国主义反扑在非洲造成的暂时逆流，决计阻挡不了非洲各国人民反帝革命斗争的主流，改变不了非洲的一片大好革命形势。
    帝国主义最近发动这一系列反扑，起了有益的反面教员的作用，促进了非洲人民的新觉醒。它再次告诉人们：帝国主义和新老殖民主义在非洲并没有死亡。政治上取得独立的国家决不能听现代修正主义所散布的“亚非殖民主义已经消灭”，“亚非人民主要任务是经济建设”等等谬论。非洲人民现在更清楚地认识到，以美国为首的新老殖民主义仍然是非洲人民的死敌。最近，从几内亚到坦桑尼亚，从马里到刚果（布），广大的非洲大陆，到处响起了反对帝国主义阴谋的警钟。
    事实表明，帝国主义的反扑，并没有吓倒坚决斗争的革命人民，相反地它激起了非洲人民更加坚强的斗志。加纳是黑非洲第一个取得独立的国家，美英帝国主义的魔掌伸到加纳不能不在非洲各国激起新的反帝风暴。
    坦桑尼亚总统尼雷尔二月二十八日说，非洲的革命形势大好，非洲人民必须继续进行非洲的革命。非洲不必由于出现一股逆流而惊慌失措。马里总统凯塔三月二日说，帝国主义“虽然表面上气势汹汹，但并不表示那些不断策划阴谋反对我们的人有力量。恰恰相反，这证明几年以来非洲人民的政治思想觉悟已经大大提高了。”几内亚总统杜尔说，为了取得胜利，只有一条道路，那就是人民天天进行斗争的道路。帝国主义的进攻将加速非洲历史的进程。
    归根到底，帝国主义的反扑只是加深了非洲人民的仇恨，更加激发他们的反帝革命精神；使他们更加清楚地分清敌友，加强团结，互相支援，加强斗争。
