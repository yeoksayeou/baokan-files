    U.S. "Strategic Reserve Forces" Are All Under Strength
    Due to the constant transfer of troops to supplement and increase the invasion forces in South Vietnam, none of the U.S. domestic "strategic reserve forces" are now at full strength or "in a state of full combat readiness."
    According to a secret investigation report recently released by the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee and quoted by the American press, as of July of last year, there were a total of ten divisions of "strategic reserve forces" in the United States, all of which were at full strength and ready for combat. However, three of these divisions have already been transferred to South Vietnam for combat, and one brigade of the 101st Airborne Division has been sent to South Vietnam, part of the 82nd Airborne Division has been dispatched to the Dominican Republic, and part of the 2nd Marine Division has been dispersed in the Atlantic. Therefore, only four army divisions have not been transferred: the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions stationed at Fort Hood, Texas, the 4th Infantry Division stationed at Fort Lewis, Washington, and the 5th Mechanized Infantry Division stationed at Fort Carson, Colorado. However, a large number of members of these four army divisions have now been drawn upon to train recruits for other units or as rotating personnel for the invading Vietnamese forces, and thus are also in a state of manpower shortage.
    An article in the New York Herald Tribune stated that, according to U.S. Army standards, a division ready for combat should be at full strength and composed of experienced soldiers, "ready to cope with emergencies anywhere." However, some of the U.S. Army's "strategic reserve divisions" are "extremely lacking in equipment and manpower, and these divisions are full of recruits, to the point that they cannot be transferred abroad."
    The article said that the recruits in these divisions "are now undergoing eight weeks of preliminary basic training because trained soldiers have been transferred to serve as rotating personnel for the Vietnam (War) and to serve as cadres in other units." And "American law stipulates that soldiers cannot be transferred abroad unless they have undergone at least four months of training. Therefore, these Army strategic reserve forces cannot be considered combat-ready."

### 美国“战略后备部队”都不满员

    美国“战略后备部队”都不满员
    由于不断抽调兵员向南越补充和增加侵略军，美国国内的“战略后备部队”现在没有一个师是满员和“处于充分战斗准备状态”的。
    据美国报刊引用参议院军备小组委员会最近发表的一个秘密调查报告说，在去年七月，美国国内一共有十个师的“战略后备队”，全都是满员和作好战斗准备的。但是其中三个师已经调到南越作战，另外第一百零一空降师已经有一个旅被抽到南越，第八十二空降师有一部分军队被抽往多米尼加，第二海军陆战队师则有一部分兵力分散在大西洋。因此，没有调动的只有四个陆军师，即驻在得克萨斯州荷德堡的第一和第二装甲师，驻在华盛顿州路易斯堡的第四步兵师，以及驻在科罗拉多州卡森堡的第五机械化步兵师。但是这四个陆军师的大批成员现在已经被抽调用来训练其他部队的新兵，或者作为侵越军队的轮换人员，因此也陷于人力不足的状态。
    《纽约先驱论坛报》的一篇文章说，根据美国陆军的标准，作好战斗准备的师应当是满员和由有经验的士兵组成的，“随时可以用来应付各地的紧急状态”。但是美国陆军的一些“战略后备师”的“装备都极端缺乏，人力极端缺乏，这些师充满新兵，以至不能用来调往国外”。
    文章说，这些师的新兵“现在正在进行八个星期的初步基本训练，因为训练有素的士兵已被调去作为越南（战争）的轮换人员和充当其他部队的干部”。而“美国法律规定，除非经过至少四个月的训练，是不能把士兵调到国外的。因此，这些陆军战略后备部队是不能认为已经作好战斗准备的。”
