    Sato government's New Steps for Expansion into Southeast Asia
    The "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference," planned by the United States and convened by the Japanese government, concluded in Tokyo on the 7th. This conference is an important step by the Sato government for American imperialism's aggression in Asia and "containing China," and for Japanese monopoly capital's expansion into Southeast Asia.
    It is no accident that the Sato government actively convened the "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference." Japanese monopoly capital has always dreamed of "American capital, Japanese technology, developing Southeast Asia." In April of last year, Johnson proposed a $1 billion "Southeast Asia Development Plan," attempting to use economic "aid" as bait while wielding the big stick, to disintegrate and eliminate the national liberation movement in the Southeast Asian region. Given the repeated failures of the United States' economic "aid" policy in the region, the Washington authorities have taken a fancy to the experienced old hand in Southeast Asia, the Japanese monopoly capital and militarist forces, and are doing their utmost to pull it in to help implement this conspiracy. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Reischauer publicly stated: In order to promote Johnson's "plan," there must be "active assistance from Japan, which has experience in Asia and is an Asian nation." Japanese monopoly capital and militarist forces, eager to expand into Southeast Asia, saw this as a great opportunity and immediately agreed. Sato echoed, "This is completely in line with my thinking. Japan is both a member of Asia and has experience in Southeast Asia. It can be said to be qualified to carry out effective economic development in Southeast Asia."
    The Sato government is so eager to expand outward for its own economic reasons. In the twenty years since the war, especially in the last decade, Japan's monopoly capitalist economy has expanded rapidly. In 1964, the level of industrial production was more than five times that of the pre-war period, with steel being 9.7 times and the chemical industry 3.39 times. Japan's share of production in the capitalist world has increased from 0.9 percent in the early post-war period of 1948 to 5.7 percent in 1962. However, Japan's total export trade in 1964 was only about twice as large as before the war. Therefore, with the great expansion of Japan's monopoly capital strength today, the contradiction between production and sales markets is very serious. Especially since the re-emergence of excess production and production capacity at the end of 1964, Japan's monopoly capitalist economy has faced many difficulties.
    Precisely because of this, Japanese monopoly capital has accelerated the pace of its expansion into Asia, especially Southeast Asia. In December 1965, five Japanese monopoly capital organizations, led by the "Keizai Dantai Rengokai" (Federation of Economic Organizations), announced a so-called "Recommendation on Economic Cooperation with Underdeveloped Countries." This "recommendation" bluntly stated: "Japan should act as the backbone of the free camp in Asia and include underdeveloped countries in the free camp." Japanese monopoly capital vainly attempts to incorporate the "economic development plans" of Southeast Asian countries into its orbit through neo-colonialist means such as "economic cooperation" and "economic assistance." It seeks to act as a partner in the U.S.' economic aggression in Southeast Asia while relying on U.S. power to establish a relatively stable "sphere of influence" belonging to Japan in Southeast Asia, so that the economy of Southeast Asia will always depend on Japan and cannot be independent. The "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" initiated by the Sato government is paving the way for the realization of Japan's new expansion program and is a new and serious step towards expansion into Southeast Asia.
    This conference is the first "international conference at the government ministerial level" convened by Japan alone after the war, and it is a "development plan" conference led by Japan outside of the "United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East" and the "Colombo Plan." On the eve of the conference, Kyodo News Agency also revealed that the conference would "not only discuss economic issues" but also "discuss political issues." Not long ago, Sato also clamored that Japan's diplomacy towards Southeast Asia "should not be based solely on the perspective that Southeast Asia is Japan's market." He has also repeatedly emphasized the "politicization of aid to East Asia." This means that Japan's external expansion is entering a new stage of transition from purely economic expansion to political-driven economic expansion.
    Recent series of facts show that the Sato government, while trying its best to help U.S. imperialism promote its war of aggression in Asia, is determined to fish in troubled waters in the turbulent international situation. On the one hand, it colludes closely with U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, playing Japan's "unique role," vainly attempting to stem the revolutionary torrent, fueling the flames for a small group of counter-revolutionary currents, and providing them with blood transfusions. On the other hand, taking advantage of the current situation where the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization is collapsing and paralyzed, and the reactionary forces in Asia are stepping up their collusion, it is seizing the opportunity to foster its own forces through "economic assistance" and other means, vainly attempting to establish a "leading position" as the "leader of Asia" and relive the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere." According to Japanese news agencies, Sato is determined to turn this conference into a conference for dividing the "new era of Asia." Sato and his ilk even promoted the so-called "Greater East Asia Conference" convened by the Tojo fascist cabinet during World War II at the meeting. It can be seen that the "Southeast Asian Development Ministerial Conference" initiated by the Sato government is a major revelation of its arrogant ambitions. This cannot but arouse close attention and high vigilance from the Japanese people and the people of Asia.

### 佐藤政府向东南亚扩张的新步骤

    佐藤政府向东南亚扩张的新步骤
    由美国策划并由日本政府召开的“东南亚开发部长会议”，已于七日在东京收场。这次会议，是佐藤政府为美帝国主义侵略亚洲和“遏制中国”，为日本垄断资本向东南亚扩张的一个重要步骤。
    佐藤政府积极召开“东南亚开发部长会议”，决非偶然。日本垄断资本一直梦想“美国资本、日本技术，开发东南亚”。去年四月，约翰逊提出用十亿美元“开发东南亚计划”，妄图在挥舞大棒的同时，以经济“援助”作诱饵，来瓦解和消灭东南亚地区的民族解放运动。鉴于美国的经济“援助”政策在这一地区一再失灵，华盛顿当局便看中对东南亚有侵略经验的识途老马——日本垄断资本和军国主义势力，极力拉它来帮助推行这一阴谋。美国驻日大使赖肖尔就公开扬言：为了推行约翰逊的“计划”，必须有“在亚洲既有经验又是亚洲民族的日本的积极援助”。急于向东南亚进行扩张的日本垄断资本和军国主义势力，把这看做是大好良机，更是一拍即合。佐藤就附和说：“这同我的想法完全一致。日本既是亚洲的一员，又在东南亚有经验，对东南亚进行有效的经济开发，可以说是一个合格者。”
    佐藤政府如此急于对外扩张，是有它的经济背景的。战后二十年来，特别是近十年来，日本垄断资本主义经济迅速膨胀。一九六四年工业生产水平为战前的五倍多，其中钢铁为九点七倍，化学工业为三点三九倍。日本在资本主义世界的生产中所占比重，已经从战后初期一九四八年的百分之零点九增加到一九六二年的百分之五点七。但是，日本的出口贸易总额到一九六四年也不过比战前扩大一倍左右。因此，在日本垄断资本实力大大膨胀的今天，生产同销售市场之间的矛盾十分严重。特别是一九六四年底再度出现生产和生产能力过剩以来，日本垄断资本主义经济面临着重重的困难。
    正因如此，日本垄断资本加速了对亚洲特别是东南亚扩张的步伐。一九六五年十二月，以“经济团体联合会”为首的五个日本垄断资本组织宣布了一项所谓“有关对不发达国家经济合作的建议”。这项“建议”露骨地说：“日本要作为亚洲自由阵营的基干，把不发达国家包括在自由阵营之内。”日本垄断资本妄想通过“经济合作”、“经济援助”等新殖民主义手段，把东南亚国家的“经济开发计划”纳入它的轨道，在东南亚充当美国经济侵略的合伙者的同时，借助美国力量在东南亚建立一个属于日本的相对稳定的“势力范围”，使东南亚的经济永远依赖日本，不能独立。现在佐藤政府发起的“东南亚开发部长会议”，就是为实现日本垄断资本新的扩张纲领铺平道路，向东南亚扩张的一个新的严重步骤。
    这次会议是战后第一次由日本单独出面召开的“政府部长级国际会议”，并且是在“联合国亚洲及远东经济委员会”和“科伦坡计划”之外，由日本领导的“开发计划”会议。在会议前夕，共同社还透露，这次会议“不仅要商谈经济问题”，而且还“商谈政治问题”。不久前，佐藤也曾叫嚷过：日本对东南亚的外交“不要仅从东南亚是日本的市场这个角度出发”。他还不止一次地强调“对东亚的援助政治化”。这就是说，日本的对外扩张正在进入由单纯经济扩张转到以政治带动经济扩张的新阶段。
    最近一系列事实表明，佐藤政府在竭力帮助美帝国主义在亚洲推行侵略战争的同时，一心想在大动荡的国际形势下，混水摸鱼。它一面同美帝国主义、苏联修正主义和各国反动派紧密勾结起来，发挥日本“独特的作用”，妄想扼阻革命洪流，为一小股反革命逆流推波助澜，输血打气；一面在目前东南亚条约集团陷入瓦解瘫痪，亚洲反动势力之间加紧勾结的情况下，乘机以“经济援助”等手段扶植自己的势力，妄图建立“亚洲盟主”的“领导地位”，重温“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦。据日本通讯社透露，佐藤一心要把这次会议变为划分“亚洲新时代”的会议。佐藤之流还在会上大肆宣扬第二次世界大战期间东条法西斯内阁召开的所谓“大东亚会议”。可见佐藤政府所发起的“东南亚开发部长会议”，正是它的狂妄野心的一次大暴露。这不能不引起日本人民、亚洲人民的密切注视和高度警惕。
