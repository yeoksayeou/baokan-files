    According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, April 26th – The heroic Albanian people, under the correct leadership of the Albanian Party of Labour, have overcome various difficulties and obstacles created by imperialism and modern revisionism, and have achieved brilliant successes in socialist construction. Now, the Albanian people are confidently striving to realize the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1966-1970).

    Before liberation, Albania was one of the most backward countries in Europe. Today, it has developed into a country with modern industry and collectivized agriculture. In 1965, Albania's total industrial output value accounted for 58.6% of the total industrial and agricultural output value.

    The mining industry occupies an important position in the Albanian national economy. After liberation, its output has increased by about 30 times compared with before liberation. The discovery of ten new mineral deposits during the period 1961-1965, as well as the completion and commissioning of several large mineral product processing and smelting plants, have shown a bright future for the further development of the mining and metallurgical industries.

    The machinery industry has also developed rapidly in the past decade. During the Third Five-Year Plan period alone, Albania built seven new modern machinery factories, increasing the machinery industry output in 1965 by three times compared to 1960. Now, Albania is able to produce many important machines, equipment, and parts that it used to rely on imports for, taking a big step forward on the road of self-reliance. The machinery factory named after Enver Hoxha began producing diesel engines and electric motors several years ago.

    In the power industry, Albania's power generation capacity in 1964 was more than 35 times higher than in 1938. During the Third Five-Year Plan period, Albania built two large hydropower stations named after Engels and Stalin, and the Kukes thermal power station. The generating capacity of the Fieri thermal power station, which will soon be completed, will be equal to three times the generating capacity of the existing five thermal power stations in the country.

    The building materials industry has been greatly developed during the Third Five-Year Plan period.

    Before liberation, Albania relied entirely on imports for textiles. Now, Albania has established a complete textile industry, and its products can not only meet the needs of its own people, but also be exported.

    Since liberation, agricultural production in Albania has also made great progress. During the three Five-Year Plans, Albania has greatly expanded its cultivated land area and irrigation area through land reclamation, draining swamps, building water conservancy projects, and improving the soil. With the strong help of the state, a total of 140 large reservoirs were built nationwide from 1961 to 1965, and farmers themselves built a large number of medium-sized and small reservoirs.

    Albania's national output of grain and cotton has been continuously developing, with a large increase compared with before liberation. 1964 was a year of bumper harvest for Albania's crops, with grain crops increasing by about 16% compared with 1963, of which wheat increased by about one time. In 1965, despite the severe drought, agriculture still achieved a good harvest, and the total agricultural output value was higher than the average annual output value of the Third Five-Year Plan, of which the grain output value was more than 5% higher.

    At present, under the leadership of the Party of Labour, the Albanian people are vigorously developing agricultural production, especially grain production, striving to achieve national grain self-sufficiency by 1970.

    The heroic Albanian people are actively responding to the great combat call of the open letter recently issued by the Central Committee of the Party of Labour, and are advancing towards new victories with a high revolutionary spirit and drive. Albanian Serik Oil Refinery in Elbasan District

    发扬高度革命精神战胜帝国主义和修正主义制造的障碍
    阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设取得光辉成就
    阿尔巴尼亚已发展成为一个拥有现代化工业和集体化农业的国家
    据新华社地拉那二十六日电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，战胜了帝国主义和现代修正主义所制造的种种困难和障碍，在社会主义建设中取得了光辉的成就。现在，阿尔巴尼亚人民正满怀信心地为实现第四个五年计划（一九六六——一九七○）而斗争。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲落后的国家之一，而今天，它已经发展成为一个拥有现代化工业和集体化农业的国家。一九六五年，阿尔巴尼亚工业总产值在工农业总产值中已占百分之五十八点六。
    采矿工业在阿尔巴尼亚国民经济中占有重要的地位，解放后它的产量比解放前提高了约三十倍。一九六一——一九六五年期间发现的十处新矿藏，以及几个大型矿产品加工和冶炼工厂的建成和投入生产，为采矿冶金工业的进一步发展展示了光辉的前景。
    机械工业在最近十几年中也发展得很快。仅在第三个五年计划期间，阿尔巴尼亚就建成了七个新型的现代化机械工厂，使一九六五年的机械工业产量比一九六○年提高了三倍。现在，阿尔巴尼亚本国已能自己生产许多过去依靠进口的重要机器设备和零件，在自力更生的道路上向前迈进了一大步。以恩维尔·霍查命名的机械厂，几年前已经开始生产柴油机和电动机。
    在电力工业方面，一九六四年阿尔巴尼亚的发电能力比一九三八年提高了三十五倍多。在第三个五年计划期间阿尔巴尼亚建成了以恩格斯和斯大林命名的两座大型水电站和库克斯热电站。不久即将建成的费里热电站的发电能力，将等于全国现有五个热电站发电能力的三倍。
    建筑材料工业在第三个五年计划期间得到了巨大发展。
    解放前，阿尔巴尼亚的纺织品全部依靠进口。现在，阿尔巴尼亚已建立起完整的纺织工业，产品不仅可以满足本国人民的需要，而且还能出口。
    解放以来，阿尔巴尼亚农业生产也有了很大的进展。在三个五年计划期间，通过开荒、排干沼泽地、兴修水利和改良土壤等工作，阿尔巴尼亚已经大大扩大了耕地面积和水利灌溉面积。在国家的大力帮助下，从一九六一——一九六五年全国共建成了一百四十个大型水库，并由农民自己动手兴建了大批中、小型水库。
    阿尔巴尼亚全国粮食和棉花的产量不断发展，比解放前有了很大的增加。一九六四年是阿尔巴尼亚的农作物丰收年，粮食作物约比一九六三年增产百分之十六，其中小麦约增产一倍。一九六五年尽管遭受了严重的旱灾，但是农业仍然获得了良好的收成，农业总产值高于第三个五年计划的年度平均产量，其中粮食产值就高出百分之五。
    目前，阿尔巴尼亚人民正在劳动党的领导下，大力发展农业生产，尤其是发展粮食生产，争取在一九七○年达到全国粮食自给。
    英雄的阿尔巴尼亚全国人民积极响应劳动党中央最近发出的公开信的伟大战斗号召，正在发扬高度的革命精神和干劲，意气风发地向新的胜利迈进。阿尔巴尼亚爱尔巴桑区赛立克石油冶炼厂
