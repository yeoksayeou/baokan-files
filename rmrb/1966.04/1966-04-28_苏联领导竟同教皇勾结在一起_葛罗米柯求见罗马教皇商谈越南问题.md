    Soviet Leaders Actually Collude with the Pope
    Gromyko Seeks an Audience with the Pope to Discuss the Vietnam Issue
    Xinhua News Agency, April 27th – Vatican dispatch: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko made a special trip to the Vatican today to meet with Pope Paul VI.
    According to reports, Gromyko held a secret 45-minute meeting with the Pope. Only interpreters were present. Vatican sources said that the two sides discussed "a wide range of world issues, particularly the Pope's hopes for achieving peace in Vietnam."
    These sources said that the meeting could be considered a "diplomatic meeting" in which the two sides exchanged views "sincerely and frankly." This is the first time a government minister of the Soviet Union has met with the Pope since the founding of the country.
    At a press conference held after the meeting, Gromyko said that "both sides expressed their views on important issues of peace." When asked by reporters whether Gromyko hoped to strengthen relations between the Soviet Union and the Vatican, he emphasized in his response the importance of striving for peace and easing tensions in "extremely broad" areas.
    Gromyko met with the Pope after ending his visit to Italy. The meeting was held at Gromyko's request.
