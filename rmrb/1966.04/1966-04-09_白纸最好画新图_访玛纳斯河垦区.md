    Editor's Note: The Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, following Chairman Mao's teachings and carrying forward the revolutionary tradition of Nanniwan, has, through more than ten years of arduous struggle, transformed many sparsely populated deserts and Gobi deserts in the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, making great contributions to the construction of the frontier.
    Here, the wind is strong, sand is plentiful, the climate is dry, and rainfall is scarce; even drinking water for humans and animals is a problem, and the salt content in the soil is sometimes as high as forty percent. The difficulties are indeed great. However, the difficulties did not scare the warriors of the Production and Construction Corps. They were brave and tenacious, unflinching in the face of danger and unafraid of difficulties, giving full play to human subjective initiative. In a relatively short period, they transformed large expanses of wasteland into modern state-owned farms, setting an example for our people to build their country independently and through hard work.
    What power enabled them to be so persistent and invincible in the struggle to transform nature and develop the frontier? It is Mao Zedong Thought. For more than ten years, the commanders and fighters of the Production and Construction Corps have consistently followed Chairman Mao's teachings that the People's Army is not only a fighting force but also a working force and a production force, wholeheartedly serving the revolution and regarding the development of the frontier as an important component of building our great motherland. Therefore, they dare to take on heavy burdens, dare to struggle against difficulties, and fully demonstrate the heroic qualities of the People's Army. Their victory in building the frontier is the victory of Mao Zedong Thought.
    In the Manas River Reclamation Area of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, when you pass through hundreds of miles of farms, through continuous belts of trees, and see the neat and picturesque fields and the emerging industrial towns, it is hard to imagine that sixteen years ago this was an empty desert. Chairman Mao said: "A blank sheet of paper has no burden and is best for writing the newest and most beautiful words, and for drawing the newest and most beautiful pictures." The achievements of the Manas River Reclamation Area are a vivid embodiment of this truth.
    The Manas River Reclamation Area is located in the southwestern part of the Junggar Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Sixteen years ago, in the Manas River and the basins of several adjacent rivers, except for some farmers cultivating upstream, the entire vast area of the middle and lower reaches was covered with wild grass and uninhabited. In 1950, the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Xinjiang came here to reclaim wasteland for production. The soldiers relied on their hands, clearing the way through thorns and thistles, harnessing water and reclaiming land, and managed six rivers, including the Manas River. They opened up modern large-scale farms, reclaimed vast wasteland, reed marshes, and alkali depressions into fertile fields, and built the new industrial cities of Shihezi and Kuitun in the central area of the farm clusters, transforming this ancient wilderness. The soldiers worked hard, creating enormous wealth for the country from scratch on a blank slate.
    Harnessing Water
    Relying on existing conditions, carrying forward the spirit of hard work, using local materials, adopting indigenous methods, and governing in stages, the Manas River area has finally been woven into a river network area.
    The construction of the Manas River Reclamation Area is indeed striving for the newest and most beautiful goals. Take the water conservancy construction, which is the lifeline of the reclamation area, for example. It has already been controlled as freely as managing tap water in the city, commanding the river water to serve production. Once the snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains flowing from the south of the reclamation area leaves the mountains, it is distributed to all directions through ground channels, elevated aqueducts, and river-crossing culverts, according to human will, flowing into fields, reservoirs, power stations, factories, and towns through 40,000 miles of channels and more than 18,000 gates and other structures. The six main rivers and more than ten springs have been completely harnessed. At the outlets of these rivers, channel head works including flood prevention, flood diversion, sand sedimentation, and rock removal have been built. In the middle and lower reaches, there are channels as dense as spider webs, and there are reservoirs along the banks, with the flow of water completely controlled by humans.
    The water conservancy construction of the Manas River Reclamation Area can be said to have been "forced" out. This wasteland sandwiched between the desert and the Gobi, like most parts of Xinjiang, has very little rainfall and a large amount of evaporation. There is no hope of planting "heaven-sent fields," and even the people who stay here will die of thirst. To develop this wasteland, the first hurdle is to harness the river and build water conservancy. However, when the soldiers first entered the wasteland, they did not understand the characteristics of the river, had no data, no tools or equipment, and lacked technical personnel. Numerous difficulties lay ahead. What to do? At that time, it was the early days of liberation, and the commanders and fighters said, "Our country has just been liberated, and the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea is still going on. We can only contribute to national construction, how can we ask for national support?" They chose the path of arduous practice, harnessing the river, producing, exploring experience, and accumulating data at the same time. After several years of practice, they gradually figured out the characteristics of the river and determined the management plan.
    How to realize this plan? At that time, there were two opinions: some people advocated building large mountain reservoirs and cement channels to replace the Gobi riverbeds. This required a large amount of national investment and a long construction period. Most of the commanders and fighters put forward another opinion, that is, relying on existing material conditions, carrying forward the spirit of hard work, using local materials, adopting indigenous methods, from indigenous to foreign, from small to large, from easy to difficult, governing in stages. Since mountain reservoirs required large investments, plain reservoirs were built; lacking cement, pebbles from the riverbed were used to build canals, which saved national investment and accelerated construction. The soldiers who dared to despise difficulties said, "Even with earthen materials and indigenous methods, we must build high-standard projects!" Then, they built the first plain reservoir, the Daquangou Reservoir, using earthen methods and earthen materials, making the reservoir strong and durable, and opening the way for the construction of more plain reservoirs.
    In order to weave the Manas River area into a river network, the soldiers traveled to and fro in the wilderness for years, from east to west, from south to north, making their home everywhere. Tan Jucai, the deputy company commander of the water conservancy troops, spent ten of his eleven years of canal and dam construction in dugouts, tents, and reed sheds. As projects were completed one by one, he carried his luggage on a shoulder pole, moving twenty-four times. Thousands upon thousands of water conservancy construction soldiers like Tan Jucai are the weavers of the Manas River network.
    Building Farms
    Without houses, dig dugouts; lacking tools, smelt iron and cast them; without draft animals, buy them with savings from allowances. The wasteland retreated, and farms were built one by one.
    The soldiers of the Manas River Reclamation Area laid out large farms on the boundless wilderness, reclaiming large tracts of cultivated land. Around each farm are rectangular strips of land, three to five hundred mu in size, about two li long and half a li wide, connected to each other. Channels, roads, and forest belts, neatly arranged, surround the strips of land, which can resist drought and wind and sand. "People say the Mana River is too desolate, but the Mana River is actually a good place. Labor can turn the world upside down, and we must turn the Gobi into paradise." The hope expressed in this song sung by the soldiers in those years has now become a reality.
    In the early days of liberation, when the soldiers first arrived in the reclamation area, besides bringing simple luggage and a few soil plows and other tools pulled by sleds, they only had their bare hands. Without houses, they dug dugouts; lacking production tools, they smelted iron and cast plowshares; without draft animals, they bought horses and cattle with savings from allowances. The soldiers said heroically, "Even if we have to dig with our hands, we will dig the wasteland into farmland."
    The 20th Regiment Farm, the earliest to be reclaimed on the west bank of the Manas River, lacked tools when it was being built. The soldiers beat grass with wooden sticks and dug the ground with small hoes and round shovels used to dig trenches. Because there were few draft animals, six or seven people pulled a soil plow and ran, which people called "making the ox die of anger." Thousands of mu of wasteland in Suxingtan were covered with dense saxaul forests, which had to be removed before the land could be cultivated. But without logging tools, the soldiers pulled them out one by one with their bare hands.
    Gao Youfu, a veteran Red Army soldier and labor hero of Nanniwan, became a pioneer again in the development of the Manas River basin. When a piece of wasteland was just being measured, he would take his troops there, dig cellars, build stoves, dig wells, and help everyone "settle down." Then he led everyone to wield soil chisels, level sand dunes, and build channels. Once a farm was built, he would hand it over to others and take the reclamation troops to open up new farms on another piece of wasteland. In five or six years, the nine pieces of wasteland they had stepped on became nine farms.
    Under the tenacious struggle of the soldiers, the wasteland retreated, and farms were established one by one, and gradually developed: reclamation progressed from using soil chisels and foot plows to using tractors; sowing progressed from hand-scattering and louvered sowing to using seeders; and threshing progressed from using wooden sticks and stone rollers to using threshing machines. Each farm has developed into a mechanized large enterprise.
    The north of the reclamation area is the Gurbantunggut Desert, with strong winds and abundant sand, which harms crops. To turn the wasteland into stable and high-yield farmland, it is also necessary to plant trees and create forests. The soldiers realized the importance of planting trees and creating forests, so they planted trees while reclaiming land, adhering to the combination of land reclamation and afforestation, everyone planting trees, year after year. In some places, the alkali content is heavy, and strip planting does not survive, so ditch planting is used; if ditch planting does not survive, pit planting is used; if willow trees do not survive, elm trees are planted, and if elm trees do not survive, oleaster trees are planted. Now, green high walls block the wind and sand outside the farm, ensuring the growth of various crops.
    Comprehensive Development
    In the spirit of self-reliance, many factories and enterprises have been established, many schools have been established, and commerce, health, and other undertakings have been launched.
    The reclamation area has not only built mechanized state-owned farms through self-reliance but has also built modern factories through self-reliance, established many schools, from primary schools to colleges and universities, and launched commerce, health, and other undertakings.
    This reclamation area is not only far from the city, but also far from the old oases. If the things needed for production and life all rely on external supply, it will not only increase a great burden on the country, but also long-distance transportation will consume manpower and material resources, which will affect the development of the reclamation cause. Therefore, from the very beginning, the farms made their own iron castings, and ground flour and pressed oil themselves. Later, with the increase of agricultural machinery such as tractors and the development of water conservancy construction, they self-reliantly established industrial and other sideline production enterprises for repairing machinery and producing raw materials. Some of these gradually broke away from the farms and formed professional units. During the Second Five-Year Plan period, due to the guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the inspiration of the Great Leap Forward, and the promotion of people's communes, the construction of the entire reclamation area entered a new stage. In accordance with the policy of taking agriculture as the main industry, diversified operations, and comprehensive development, and based on national needs and local raw material conditions, the reclamation area established many factories and enterprises in the spirit of self-reliance. Farms grow cotton, so textile factories are built; farms produce sugar beets, so sugar factories are built; there are many sheep in the reclamation area, so wool spinning factories are built; reeds and cogongrass are abundant on the wasteland, so paper mills are built.
    To take the road of self-reliance, one must dare to shoulder heavy burdens, endure great hardships, and endure great labor. When the Shihezi "August 1st" Sugar Factory was built in 1958, except for a few power machines allocated by the state, 85 percent of the factory's machines were manufactured by itself. At that time, there were only more than 70 machinists, riveters, forgers, welders and other mechanical workers and three small machine tools. However, the workers did not shrink back in the face of difficulties, bravely undertaking the task of manufacturing more than 500 machines with a total weight of 1,000 tons for the sugar factory. They started by making pliers and wrenches, and manufactured their own lathes, planers, drilling machines, and welding machines, and then used these machines to produce sugar factory equipment. As a result, equipment that would have taken two or three years to manufacture by relying on outside factories was made and installed in one year by their own efforts, and put into production on schedule.
    Each of the existing factories in the reclamation area has a history of arduous creation. The Shihezi "August 1st" Tractor Repair and Assembly Plant started with a three-legged vise stand and a few pliers. After arduous efforts, it has now developed into a repair and assembly plant responsible for the repair and assembly of hundreds of tractors. The Kuitun Paper Mill started with an iron pot and a red stove, and gradually developed into a paper mill with an annual output of 800 tons of cardboard.
    In addition to middle schools in farms and primary schools in production teams, the reclamation area has also established Shihezi Agricultural College and Shihezi Medical College.
    In the struggle to transform the world in the desert area, the soldiers of the Production and Construction Corps have always kept in mind that they are soldiers of the people, soldiers of Chairman Mao. They are based in the Manas River and have the whole country in mind, regarding the development of the wasteland as a heavy revolutionary burden. With such a red heart to fight wholeheartedly for the Party and the people, plus the organizational strength of the People's Liberation Army, they have become an invincible team in the struggle to conquer nature. In the past, people said that the area north of 42 degrees north latitude was a "forbidden zone" for cotton planting, but the soldiers firmly believed that man can conquer nature. After bold experiments, they not only successfully tried planting cotton in the area around 44 degrees north latitude, but also continued to obtain high yields. In 1965, the average yield of ginned cotton per mu in the entire basin was more than 110 jin, creating a large-area high-yield record in the northernmost cotton planting area in China, completely breaking the myth of the cotton planting "forbidden zone."
    The production troops have always maintained the true color of the combat troops and maintained the fighting style of moving at the sound of the wind and acting with swiftness and decision. The soldiers regard each production task as a combat task, and they will never give up until they achieve their goal. They say it well: "There are no difficulties in front of heroes, and heroes emerge in the face of difficulties." Countless heroic soldiers who have emerged in the reclamation area have been trained in the struggle of hard work and self-reliance. Hou Zhengyuan, a production corps-level labor model and national red flag tractor driver, did not recognize a single part on the locomotive when he put down the soil chisel to drive a tractor. But he studied hard and diligently, became so proficient that he could tell the condition of the locomotive by its sound, and created excellent results in mechanized farming operations. Zhang Shihai, a second-level labor model and plant protection expert of the Production Corps, started from not knowing a single word to study plant protection science. He poured a red revolutionary heart into plant protection work and worked hard for thirteen years, finally mastering the life rules of the main cotton pests in the reclamation area and the control methods of various crop diseases. Heroic figures like Hou Zhengyuan and Zhang Shihai can be found on all fronts of the reclamation area.
    The desert area developed by the soldiers of the military reclamation area is indeed a blank sheet of paper. There is nothing ready-made to rely on on this blank sheet of paper, but there are no old burdens that affect the pace of advancement. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they are moving forward along the socialist road!

    白纸最好画新图
    ——访玛纳斯河垦区
    编者按：新疆生产建设兵团，遵循毛主席的教导，发扬南泥湾的革命传统，经过十几年的艰苦奋斗，改造了天山南北许多人烟稀少的荒漠和戈壁滩，在建设边疆中作出巨大的贡献。
    这里风大沙多，气候干燥，降雨量很小，甚至连人畜饮用水都感到困难，土壤中的盐碱有的高达百分之四十。困难的确是很大的。但是，困难并没吓倒生产建设兵团的勇士们。他们英勇顽强，不避艰险，不怕困难，高度地发挥了人的主观能动性，在并不很长的时间内，就把大片大片的荒滩、荒地建设成为现代化的国营农场，为我国人民自力更生、艰苦奋斗地建设自己的国家树立了一个榜样。
    是什么力量使他们在改造自然、开发边疆的斗争中，这样坚韧不拔，无坚不摧呢？是毛泽东思想。十几年来，生产建设兵团的指战员们，始终遵循着毛主席关于人民军队既是战斗队，又是工作队，也是生产队的教导，一心为革命，一切为革命，把开发边疆看作是建设我们伟大祖国的一个重要组成部分。因此，他们勇于拣重担子挑，勇于同困难作斗争，充分表现了人民军队的英雄本色。他们在建设边疆中所获得的胜利，就是毛泽东思想的胜利。
    在新疆生产建设兵团玛纳斯河垦区，当你穿过纵横几百里的农场，通过绵延不断的林带，看到整齐如画的田园和新兴的工业城镇之后，很难想象到在十六年以前这里竟是空荡荡的荒漠。毛主席说：“一张白纸，没有负担，好写最新最美的文字，好画最新最美的画图。”玛纳斯河垦区的成就，正是这个真理的生动活泼的体现。
    玛纳斯河垦区位于新疆维吾尔自治区准噶尔盆地西南部。十六年以前，玛纳斯河及相邻几条河的流域内，除了上游有些农民耕种以外，整个中下游广阔地区，都是连天荒草，没有人烟。一九五○年，人民解放军驻新疆的部队来到这里开荒生产。军垦战士们凭着双手，披荆斩棘，治水开荒，治理了包括玛纳斯河在内的六条河流，开辟出现代化的大农场，把广阔荒滩、苇湖、碱窝垦成了良田，在农场群的中心区建起工业新城石河子和奎屯，使这旷古的荒原换了人间。军垦战士们艰苦奋斗，在一片白地上，从无到有，为国家创造了巨大的财富。
    治水
    依靠现有条件，发扬苦干精神，就地取材，土法上马，分期治理，终于把玛纳斯河地区织成河网区。
    玛纳斯河垦区的建设，的确是以最新最美为奋斗目标的。就拿垦区命根子的水利建设来说吧，这里已经作到象城市里管理自来水那样控制自如，指挥着河水来为生产服务了。从垦区南面流来的天山雪水一出山，就按人的意志，从地面渠道，从架空渡槽，从穿河涵洞，分赴四方，通过四万里长的渠道和一万八千多座闸门等建筑物，流进田地、水库、电站、工厂和城镇。六条主要河流和十多条泉溪，都已得到根治。这些河流的出山口，修起了包括拦洪、分洪、沉砂、排石的渠首工程，中下游有密如蛛网的渠道，沿河两岸有水库，流水完全为人所掌握。
    玛纳斯河垦区的水利建设，可以说是“逼”出来的。这片夹在沙漠、戈壁当中的荒原，和新疆绝大部分地区一样，降雨量很小而蒸发量很大，种“望天田”是毫无指望的，连呆在这里的人也会渴死。要开发这片荒原，首要的一关是治河修水利。可是，军垦战士初进荒原，一不了解河流的特性，二无资料，三无工具和设备，四缺技术人员，重重困难横亘在前面。怎么办呢？当时正是解放初期，广大指战员说：“我们国家刚解放，抗美援朝战争还在进行，我们只能为国家建设出力，还能要国家支援？”他们选择了艰苦实践的道路，边治河，边生产，边摸索经验，边积累资料。经过几年的实践，逐步摸清了河流的特征，确定了治理计划。
    如何实现这个计划，当时有两种意见：有的人主张修山区大水库，修水泥渠道来代替戈壁河床。这样需要国家大量投资，而且要较长的建设时间。大多数指战员提出了另外的意见，那就是依靠现有物质条件，发扬人的苦干精神，就地取材，土法上马，由土到洋，由小到大，由易到难，分期治理。山区水库投资大，就修建平原水库；缺少水泥，就用河床里的卵石砌渠，这样，既可节省国家投资，又可加快建设速度。敢于藐视困难的战士们说：“用土材料和土办法，也要建成高标准的工程！”接着，他们修建第一座平原水库——大泉沟水库，用土办法土材料，把水库修得结实耐用，为修建更多平原水库打开了道路。
    为了把玛纳斯河地区织成河网，战士们从东到西，从南到北，经年累月在荒野奔波，随处为家。水利部队副连长谈俱才，修渠筑坝十一年中，有十年是在地窝子、帐篷、苇棚里度过的，随着工程一个一个完成，他用扁担担着行李，搬了二十四次家。象谈俱才一样的成千上万的水利建设战士，就是玛纳斯河网的编织人。
    建场
    没房子，挖地窝子；缺工具，自己化铁铸；没耕畜，用节约的津贴买。荒滩退却了，农场一个个建起来。
    玛纳斯河垦区的战士在漠漠无边的荒原上，布下了大农场，开垦出大片大片耕地，每座农场四周，是三五百亩为单位，长约两华里、宽约半华里的一块接一块的长方形条田。一条条渠道、道路、林带，整整齐齐，围护着条田，能抗干旱，能抗风沙。“人说玛河太荒凉，玛河实是好地方，劳动可以翻天地，定叫戈壁变天堂。”军垦战士当年唱的这首歌中所表达的希望，如今变成了现实。
    解放初期，军垦战士刚到垦区，除了用爬犁拉来简单的行李和很少的土犁等工具以外，只有一双手。没有房子，他们挖地窝子；缺少生产工具，自己化铁铸铧犁；没有耕畜，就用节约的津贴费购买马牛。战士们豪迈地说：“就是用手刨，也要把荒地刨成农田。”
    玛纳斯河西岸开垦最早的二十团农场，在建场时，因为缺乏工具，战士们用木棍打草，用挖战壕的小镐和圆锹挖地；耕畜少，六七个人拉一张土犁飞跑，人称“气死牛”。苏兴滩几千亩荒地上长着密集的索索林，必须除掉才能种地，可是没有伐木工具，战士们硬是用双手一棵一棵拔光。
    老红军、南泥湾的劳动英雄高有富，在开发玛纳斯河流域中又成了开路先锋。当一块荒地刚开始测量时，他就带着部队到那里，挖地窑，架炉灶，打井，帮助大家“安家”。然后领着大家抡砍土镘，平沙丘，修渠道。当农场一建成，他又交给别人，带着垦荒部队到另一块荒原上开辟新农场去了。五六年中，他们脚下踏过的九片荒原，变成了九个农场。
    在战士们顽强奋战之下，荒滩退却了，农场一个一个地建立起来，并且逐步发展：开荒由用砍土镘、步犁，进到用拖拉机；播种由手撒、耧播，进到播种机播，打场由用木棍、石磙，进到用打谷机。每个农场都发展成为机械化的大企业了。
    垦区的北面就是古尔班通古特沙漠，风大沙多，危害农作物。要把荒滩变成稳产高产农田，还必须植树造林。战士们认识到植树造林的重要性，就边开荒生产，边栽树，坚持开荒与造林相结合，人人栽树，年年栽树。有些地方碱重，畦栽不活，沟栽；沟栽不活，挖坑栽；杨柳不活栽榆树，榆树不活栽沙枣。现在，一道道绿色高墙，把风沙挡在农场之外，保障了各种农作物的生长。
    全面发展
    以自力更生精神，兴办了许多工厂、企业，办了许多学校，办起了商业、卫生等事业。
    垦区不仅自力更生建成了机械化国营农场，并且自力更生建成了现代化的工厂，办了许多学校，从小学直到高等院校，办起了商业、卫生以及其他事业。
    这个垦区不仅远离城市，就是同老绿洲也隔得远远的，如果生产、生活所需要的东西，都要靠外地供应，不仅给国家增加很大的负担，而且长途转运，耗费人力物力，将影响垦荒事业的发展。所以，农场从一开始就自己打铁铸造，自己磨面榨油，后来随着拖拉机等农业机械的增加和水利建设的发展，又自力更生地办起了修理机械和生产原料材料的工业和其他副业生产企业，有一些并逐渐脱出农场办的范围，形成专业单位。第二个五年计划期间，由于党的社会主义建设总路线的指引，大跃进的激励和人民公社化的促进，整个垦区的建设进入一个新的阶段。垦区按照以农为主、多种经营、全面发展的方针，根据国家需要和当地原料条件，以自力更生精神兴办许多工厂企业。农场种棉花，就建纺织厂；生产甜菜，就办糖厂；垦区羊多，就建毛纺厂；荒滩上芦苇、芨芨草丰富，就办造纸厂。
    走自力更生之路，就得敢挑重担子，吃大苦，耐大劳。石河子八一制糖厂一九五八年建厂时除了几台动力机器是国家拨给的，糖厂百分之八十五的机器都靠自己制造。当时只有七十多个钳工、铆工、锻工、焊工等机械工人和三台小机床。但是，工人们没有在困难面前退缩，勇敢地承担起糖厂总重一千吨的五百多台机器的制造任务。他们从打制钳子、扳子开始，自己制造车床、刨床、钻床和电焊机等机器，然后用这些机器生产糖厂设备。结果，依靠外厂要两三年才能制成的设备，自己动手，一年就全部制成并安装好，按期投入生产。
    垦区现有的工厂，每个厂都有一段艰苦创造的历史。石河子八一拖拉机修配厂，是从一架三条腿钳台，几把钳子起家的。经过艰苦的努力，现在发展成为担负几百台拖拉机修配任务的修配厂了。奎屯造纸厂从一口铁锅、一盘红炉干起，逐渐建成为一座年产八百吨板纸的纸厂。
    垦区除了农场有中学，生产队有小学以外，还办起了石河子农学院、石河子医学专科学校。
    军垦战士在荒漠地带进行改天换地的斗争中，始终牢记着自己是人民子弟兵，是毛主席的战士，他们立足玛纳斯河，胸怀全国，把开发荒原当作革命重担。有了这样全心全意为党和人民而奋斗的红心，加上人民解放军的组织力量，他们在征服大自然的斗争中，成为无往不胜的队伍。过去人们说，北纬四十二度以北地区是植棉“禁区”，但战士们坚信人定胜天，经过大胆的试验，不但在北纬四十四度左右地区试种棉花成功，而且不断获得高产。一九六五年全流域的棉花平均亩产皮棉一百一十斤多，创造出我国最北部植棉区大面积高产纪录，彻底打破了植棉“禁区”的神话。
    生产部队始终保持着战斗部队的本色，保持着闻风而动，雷厉风行的战斗作风。战士们把每项生产任务都当作战斗任务去执行，不达目的，决不罢休。他们说得好：“英雄面前无困难，困难面前出英雄”。垦区涌现的无数英雄战士，就是在艰苦奋斗、自力更生的斗争中锻炼出来的。生产兵团一级劳动模范、全国红旗拖拉机手侯正元，当他放下砍土镘去开拖拉机的时候，连机车上一个零件都不认识。但是他苦学苦钻，熟练到凭声音就知道机车的情况，创造出机耕作业的优异成绩。兵团二级劳动模范、植保专家张世海，是从一个字不识开始研究植物保护科学的。他把一颗革命红心倾注到植物保护工作上，苦干十三年，终于掌握了垦区棉花主要害虫的生活规律和多种作物病害的防治方法。象侯正元、张世海这样的英雄人物，在垦区的各条战线上都可以会见。
    军垦区战士们开展的荒漠地带的确是一张白纸，这张白纸上没有任何现成的东西可以凭借，但是也没有任何旧的负担影响前进的步伐。他们按照毛泽东思想的指引，沿着社会主义的大道，一往直前！
