Title: Rusk's clumsy two-pronged anti-China strategy is extremely clumsy. Persisting in the old policy of hostility towards China, peddling a new trick of false friendship, attempting to paralyze world opinion and ease domestic unrest in the United States.

    According to Xinhua News Agency, Washington, April 18: U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk recently submitted to Congress "Ten Factors" of U.S. policy toward China. While adhering to the policy of hostility and aggression against China, he talked glibly about "increasing contact" and "restoring friendship" with China, attempting to play a counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy of false peace but true aggression, and false friendship but true hostility, in front of American and world public opinion.
    These ten points of China policy were put forward against the background that the United States is constantly expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam and intensifying its provocations against China, which may lead to conflicts with China, thus causing widespread opposition and unease at home and abroad.
    According to Rusk's robber logic, the obstacle to "improving" Sino-U.S. relations lies not in the United States, but in China. The U.S. policy of aggression and hostility towards China must not be changed, but China should abandon its sovereignty and revolutionary stance in the face of U.S. aggression.
    At the beginning of his speech, Rusk emphasized the importance of "containing Communist aggression in Asia." In the first four of the ten points of China policy, he stated that the United States would "continue to resolutely assist its allies in resisting Chinese aggression"; continue to assist the reactionary puppet regimes in Asia; continue to occupy China's sacred territory of Taiwan, maintain its "obligations" to the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and continue to work to maintain the political zombie of the Chiang Kai-shek clique in the United Nations, and oppose the restoration of China's legitimate seat in the United Nations. That is to say, the United States will adhere to its position of being hostile to the Chinese people and pursue its policy of aggression and war against China and the people of Asian countries.
    In order to paralyze American and world public opinion, Rusk hypocritically said that "the United States does not intend to attack" China, and "avoid believing that there is an endless and inevitable state of hostility between the United States and Communist China." When the United States openly declared China as its main enemy, stepped up its war of aggression against Vietnam, and extended the flames of war to China, he himself knew that his lies could not deceive anyone. Therefore, he admitted, "Of course, there is a danger of war with China." Rusk also proposed increasing the so-called "possibilities for non-official contact" between the United States and China, including inviting Chinese scientists to visit the United States; maintaining the Sino-U.S. talks in Warsaw, hoping that this meeting "may become at some point" a "fruitful dialogue path" for the Johnson administration; willing to meet with China to discuss the so-called "disarmament and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons," and "continue to explore and analyze all intelligence about China to make American policy adapt to the current situation."
    Rusk's ten factors of China policy are a mixture of hostility towards China and a fraud, in which hostility and aggression, containment and encirclement of China are real, and things like "improving" relations and "avoiding" a state of hostility are fake. It also includes the United States' attempt to carry out a "penetration" conspiracy against China,妄想 hoping that China will undergo "peaceful evolution" and "may lead to important changes in the policies of a new generation of leaders."
    A Reuters report from Washington on the 16th also exposed the hypocrisy of this "goodwill" gesture by the United States. The report said that Rusk actually believed that the Beijing leaders could not respond to this action by the United States because the ten points of China policy included conditions that China refused to accept. The British "Times" also admitted that "it is impossible to expect China and the United States to exchange scholars and journalists because China feels threatened."

    腊斯克玩弄反华两手策略拙劣至极
    坚持敌视中国的老政策，兜售假友好的新骗局
    妄想借此麻痹世界舆论，缓和美国国内的不安
    据新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克最近向国会提出了美国对华政策“十点因素”，在坚持对中国的敌视和侵略政策的同时，大谈其同中国“增加接触”“恢复友好”，企图在美国和世界舆论面前玩弄假和平、真侵略，假友好、真敌视的反革命两手策略。
    这个十点对华政策是在美国不断扩大侵越战争、加紧对中国进行挑衅的做法可能导致同中国的冲突，因而在国内外引起广泛反对和不安的背景下提出的。
    按照腊斯克的强盗逻辑，妨碍中美关系“改善”的障碍，不在美国，而在中国。美国对中国的侵略和敌视政策决不能改变，而中国却应该在美国的侵略面前放弃自己的主权和革命立场。
    腊斯克在谈话一开头就强调“在亚洲遏制共产党侵略”的重要性。他在十点对华政策的头四点中声明：美国要“继续坚决援助盟国反对中国侵略”；继续援助亚洲反动傀儡政权；继续霸占中国的神圣领土台湾，保持对蒋介石集团的“义务”以及继续努力在联合国保持蒋介石集团政治僵尸，反对恢复中国在联合国的合法席位。这就是说，美国要坚持它同中国人民为敌的立场，推行它反对中国、反对亚洲各国人民的侵略和战争政策。
    为了麻痹美国和世界舆论，腊斯克假惺惺地说什么，“美国不打算进攻”中国，“避免认为美国和共产党中国之间存在着一种无休止的不可避免的敌对状态”。在美国公开宣布把中国当作主要敌人，加紧扩大侵越战争，并把战火烧向中国的时候，他自己也知道，他这番假话是骗不了人的。因此，他承认，“当然，存在着同中国发生战争的危险”。腊斯克还提出增加美国和中国之间的所谓“非官方接触的可能性”，包括邀请中国的科学家访问美国；保持华沙中美会谈，幻想这一会谈在“某个时候可能成为”对约翰逊政府说来是“有成果的对话的途径”；愿意同中国开会讨论所谓“裁军及不扩散核武器问题”，以及“继续探索、分析有关中国的一切情报，以使美国的政策适应当前的情况”。
    腊斯克的对华政策十点因素是敌视中国加骗局的混合物，其中敌视和侵略，遏制和包围中国是真“改善”关系、“避免”敌对状态之类是假。它还包括美国企图对中国搞“渗透”的阴谋，妄想中国会发生“和平演变”，“可能造成一代新的领导人的政策上的重要变化”。
    路透社十六日从华盛顿发出的报道也道破了美国这种“善意”姿态的虚伪性。报道说，腊斯克实际上认为，北京领导人不可能对美国的这一行动作出响应。因为十点对华政策中包括中国拒绝接受的条件。英国的《泰晤士报》也承认，“不可能指望中国和美国交换学者和记者，因为中国感到自身受到了威胁”。
