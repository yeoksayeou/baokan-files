    (Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 10th) The Shanghai men's and women's table tennis team one, the national champions of last year, both won the men's and women's team championships at the 1966 National Table Tennis Championships tonight. In the finals held tonight to compete for the national championships, they defeated the Hubei men's team, the national third-place winner last year, and the Sichuan women's team, the national runner-up last year, with scores of 5-2 and 3-0 respectively. The Hubei men's team and the Sichuan women's team won the men's and women's team runner-up positions.
    The two championship matches held at the Jiangwan Sports Center in Shanghai attracted more than 6,000 spectators. They frequently applauded and cheered enthusiastically for the athletes' excellent skills and tenacious fighting spirit.
    Shanghai Men's Team One, consisting of Li Furong, Zhang Xielin, and Yu Yize, played against Hubei Men's Team, consisting of Chen Shengxing, He Zubin, and Shi Tiejun, a nineteen-year-old newcomer participating in a national competition for the first time. The battle lasted for two hours. Hubei Team and Shanghai Team One are old rivals. At the Second National Games last year, after eight games, Shanghai Team One won 5-3. Therefore, both sides were fully prepared before today's game. The Hubei team dared to fight hard in the game, showing a tenacious fighting style. Chen Shengxing and He Zubin defeated Li Furong and Zhang Xielin, who had beaten them last year, with the same score of 2-0. The players of Shanghai Team One took every ball seriously in the game, playing at a high level, and finally won the national men's team championship again.
    The women's team championship was a match of "softness" overcoming "strength." Shanghai Team One, consisting of Lin Huiqing and Zheng Minzhi, completely controlled the situation with their steady chopping defense. As a result, all three games were won with a score of 2-0 against the Sichuan team, consisting of three offensive players, Yan Guifen, Tang Annong, and sixteen-year-old newcomer Li Yucheng, thus winning the national women's team championship.
    Since the Second National Games last year, teams from all over the country have continued to study Chairman Mao's works and have undergone arduous training. Their ideological and technical levels have been improved to varying degrees. In this team competition, they demonstrated the style of daring to fight and never being arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat. Therefore, the competition became more and more exciting. The rankings of the teams have also changed significantly compared to last year. The teams that won third to tenth place in the men's team are: Hebei Team One (fifth place last year), Beijing Team One (second place last year), Guangdong Team One (ninth place last year), Shanghai Team Two, Jiangxi Team (fourth place last year), Jiangsu Team One (tenth place last year), Jilin Team (sixth place last year), Sichuan Team (eighth place last year).
    The teams that won third to tenth place in the women's team are: Guangdong Team One (third place last year), Liaoning Team One (ninth place last year), Shanghai Team Two, Hubei Team (eighth place last year), Shanxi Team (eleventh place last year), Shandong Team One (fourth place last year), Beijing Team One (sixth place last year), Beijing Team Two.
    Today is the last day of the men's and women's team competitions. The thirty finals to determine the rankings from first to thirtieth place for the men's and women's teams, which were held in four indoor courts from morning to night, were almost all very intense. Among the fifteen men's finals, twelve games were decided after six to nine sets; in the fifteen women's finals, twelve games were decided after four to five sets.
    Today, the results of the three matches to determine the fifth to tenth place rankings in the men's team competition are: Guangdong Team One defeated Shanghai Team Two 5-0, Jiangxi Team defeated Jiangsu Team One 5-4, and Jilin Team defeated Sichuan Team 5-2.
    The results of the three matches to determine the fifth to tenth place rankings in the women's team competition are: Shanghai Team Two defeated Hubei Team 3-1, Shanxi Team defeated Shandong Team One 3-2, and Beijing Team One defeated Beijing Team Two 3-1.

    全国乒乓球锦标赛男女团体赛结束
    上海男女乒乓球一队双获冠军
    湖北男子队和四川女子队分获男女团体亚军
    据新华社上海十日电　去年全国冠军上海男、女乒乓球一队，今晚双双获得了一九六六年全国乒乓球锦标赛的男、女团体冠军。他们在今晚举行的争夺全国冠军的决赛中，分别以五比二和三比○战胜去年全国第三名湖北男子队和去年全国亚军四川女子队。湖北男子队和四川女子队获得了男、女团体亚军。
    在上海江湾体育馆进行的这两场冠军争夺战，吸引观众达六千多人。他们不时为运动员们的出色球艺和顽强的战斗风格热烈鼓掌和喝采。
    上海男子一队今晚由李富荣、张燮林和于贻泽出场，同湖北男子队的陈盛兴、何祖斌和第一次参加全国性比赛的十九岁的新手史铁君对垒。双方打了两个小时才结束战斗。湖北队和上海一队是老对手，在去年第二届全运会上，双方经过八盘决战，上海一队才以五比三获胜。因此在今天这一场比赛以前，双方都做了充分的思想准备。湖北队在比赛中敢搏敢拼，表现了顽强的战斗风格，陈盛兴和何祖斌以二比○的同样比分，分别战胜了去年曾经赢过他们的李富荣和张燮林。上海一队的选手们在比赛中认真对待每一个球，打出了很高的水平，终于再一次获得男子团体全国冠军。
    女子团体冠军争夺战是一场以“柔”克“刚”的比赛，上海一队出场的是林慧卿和郑敏之，她们在比赛中用稳健的削球完全控制了局势，结果三盘比赛都以二比○的战绩赢了由三名进攻型的选手鄢桂芬、唐安农和十六岁的新手李玉成组成的四川队，从而取得女子团体全国冠军。
    由于各地球队从去年第二届全运会以后，继续大学毛主席著作，进行了刻苦的锻炼，思想和技术水平又有了不同程度的提高，在这次的团体赛中发扬了敢打敢拼和胜不骄败不馁的风格，因此比赛越打越精采。各队获得的名次同去年比较，也有很大变化。其中获得男子团体第三名到第十名的各队是：河北一队（去年全国第五名）、北京一队（去年第二名）、广东一队（去年第九名）、上海二队、江西队（去年第四名）、江苏一队（去年第十名）、吉林队（去年第六名）、四川队（去年第八名）。
    获得女子团体第三名到第十名的各队是：广东一队（去年第三名）、辽宁一队（去年第九名）、上海二队、湖北队（去年第八名）、山西队（去年第十一名）、山东一队（去年第四名）、北京一队（去年第六名）、北京二队。
    今天是锦标赛男、女团体赛的最后一天，从早到晚分别在四个室内球场进行的三十场决定男、女团体第一名到第三十名名次的决赛，几乎场场都打得很激烈。男子的十五场决赛中，有十二场打了六盘到九盘才分胜负；女子的十五场决赛，打到四盘到五盘才见高低的也有十二场。
    今天，男子团体决定第五名到第十名名次的三场比赛结果是：广东一队以五比○胜上海二队、江西队以五比四胜江苏一队、吉林队以五比二胜四川队。
    女子团体决定第五名到第十名名次的三场比赛结果是：上海二队以三比一胜湖北队、山西队以三比二胜山东一队、北京一队以三比一胜北京二队。
    参加这次锦标赛的各地选手明天休息一天，从十二日起进行男、女单打，男、女双打以及混合双打五个单项的比赛。
