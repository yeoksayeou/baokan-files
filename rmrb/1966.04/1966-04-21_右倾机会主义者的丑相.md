Title: The Ugly Face of Right-leaning Opportunists

Edition: 5

    In his many articles and the play "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," Comrade Wu Han desperately praised Hai Rui. He spent several years writing "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," revising it seven times, putting in a great deal of effort! What kind of "hero" is Hai Rui in the writings of Comrade Wu Han? We say he is the "heroic" image of right-leaning opportunists.

    Please note that before the Lushan Conference of the Party Central Committee, some right-leaning opportunists were criticizing the Party Central Committee, but Comrade Wu Han felt the criticism was not painful enough, so he had Hai Rui in his writings "criticize very painfully." At the time of the Lushan Conference of the Party Central Committee, the right-leaning opportunists who styled themselves as "Hai Rui" were defeated, and some people felt finished. However, Hai Rui in the writings of Comrade Wu Han was "indomitable, never discouraged, and bravely threw his whole life into battle." Some people were "dismissed from office" and went off stage in disgrace. However, Hai Rui in the writings of Comrade Wu Han was "still proud" and "did not yield." Even if he lost his official position, he would kill a few people to vent his anger. He even shouted loudly: "I, Hai Rui, lose my official hat with an open mind, and one day when I regain office, I will reorganize the discipline." Isn't such an image of Hai Rui the vanguard of right-leaning opportunists against the Party and socialism? Isn't he a reactionary element who dares to "go all out" and fight us? Isn't he a "hero" who refuses to bow his head and admit guilt, and is counter-revolutionary to the end?

    Comrade Wu Han's efforts to create such a counter-revolutionary image are precisely to set an example and point the way for right-leaning opportunists. How can it be said that he is "writing about the past for the sake of the past, writing a play for the sake of writing a play"? Comrade Wu Han calls for learning from Hai Rui, which is to urge every right-leaning opportunist to compete with Hai Rui in opposing the Party and the people. This is precisely serving the politics of right-leaning opportunists and the politics of capitalist restoration. How can it be said that it is "detached from politics and detached from reality"?

    In his "self-criticism," Comrade Wu Han also said that his "political stance is firm." We want to ask Comrade Wu Han: When right-leaning opportunists were wantonly attacking the Three Red Banners, you wrote extensively about "returning land" and promoted "individual farming." During the three years of natural disasters in our country, the Party told us that the difficulties were temporary, but you shouted, "Every family is completely impoverished." The Party called on us to criticize right-leaning opportunism, but you called on people to learn the "proud bones" of counter-revolutionaries. All these things show which class's stance you have taken?

    The Hai Rui in Comrade Wu Han's writings is indeed "flesh and blood." This shows that Comrade Wu Han's feelings are too consistent with this "Hai Rui." Comrade Wu Han is simply using Hai Rui's mouth to express his own feelings.

    We can distinguish and recognize Comrade Wu Han's tricks. We would like to tell Comrade Wu Han that the Party is the lifeblood of our working class, and we cannot allow anyone to damage even a hair of the Party. If Comrade Wu Han continues to "try again after failure" like Hai Rui, we will definitely fight you to the end.

    右倾机会主义者的丑相	刘宗明
    吴晗同志在他的许多文章及剧本《海瑞罢官》中，拼命吹捧海瑞。一部《海瑞罢官》，写了几年，七易其稿，很是下了一番苦功夫！吴晗同志笔下的海瑞，是一个什么样的“英雄”呢？我们说，他是右倾机会主义分子的“英雄”形象。
    请看，在党中央庐山会议之前，一些右倾机会主义分子在骂党中央，但吴晗同志还觉得骂得不够痛快，叫他笔下的海瑞出来“骂得非常之痛快”。在党中央庐山会议之时，自命“海瑞”的右倾机会主义分子被击败了，有些人觉得完蛋了。可是吴晗同志笔下的海瑞却是“不屈不挠，从不灰心丧气，勇敢地把全生命投入战斗”。有的人被“罢了官”灰溜溜地下台了。可是，吴晗同志笔下的海瑞，却是“傲骨依然在”，“并不屈服”，丢了官，也要杀他几个人出气。甚至高声大喊：“我海瑞丢纱帽心胸开朗，有一日再居官重整纪纲”。这样一个海瑞形象，不正是右倾机会主义分子反党反社会主义的急先锋吗？不正是敢于“豁出去”和我们拼的反动分子吗？不正是死不低头认罪，反革命到底的“英雄”吗？
    吴晗同志努力塑造这样一个反革命的形象，正是要给右倾机会主义分子树样板，指方向，怎么能说是“为古而古，为写戏而写戏”呢？吴晗同志号召学习海瑞，就是要每一个右倾机会主义分子和海瑞赛着干，赛着反党、反人民。这正是为右倾机会主义分子的政治服务，为资本主义复辟的政治服务，又怎么能说是“脱离了政治，脱离了现实”呢？
    吴晗同志在“自我批评”中，还说他“政治上的立场是站稳了的”。我们要问问吴晗同志：在右倾机会主义分子大肆攻击三面红旗之时，你却大写“退田”，宣传“单干”。在我国三年自然灾害之时，党告诉我们困难是暂时的，你却叫喊“家家穷得干干净净”。党号召我们批判右倾机会主义，你却号召人们要学反革命的“傲骨”。如此种种，说明你站稳了哪个阶级的立场了呢？
    吴晗同志笔下的海瑞确实是“有血有肉”的。这说明吴晗同志的感情和这个“海瑞”太一致了。吴晗同志不过是借海瑞之口，抒自己之情罢了。
    对于吴晗同志的花招，我们是分得清，认得明的。我们愿意告诉吴晗同志，党是我们工人阶级的命根子，任何人想损害党的一根毫毛，我们都不能答应。如果吴晗同志继续象海瑞一样，“失败了再干”，我们一定和你斗争到底。
