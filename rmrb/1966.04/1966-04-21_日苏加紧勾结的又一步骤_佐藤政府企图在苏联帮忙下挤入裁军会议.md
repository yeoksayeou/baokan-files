    Another Step in the Intensified Collusion Between Japan and the Soviet Union
    Sato Government Attempts to Squeeze into the Disarmament Conference with Soviet Help
    Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 20th—The Japanese Sato government is attempting, with the support of the Soviet revisionist clique, to squeeze into the Geneva Disarmament Conference in order to help the US and the Soviet Union reach a "non-proliferation" agreement to oppose China.
    According to reports, Japanese Foreign Minister Etsusaburo Shiina said on the Cabinet Committee of the Senate on the 19th: "In order to increase our say on the issue of nuclear disarmament, Japan must strive to participate in the Geneva Disarmament Conference."
    Hoshino Bunchichi, Director-General of the United Nations Bureau of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, stated: "Japan hopes to realize a non-proliferation treaty as soon as possible."
    The *Sankei Shimbun* revealed on the 20th that Japan will discuss the issue of Japan's participation in the Geneva Disarmament Conference with the Soviet Union when Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko visits Japan in mid-May.
    The newspaper said that when the Disarmament Conference was established in 1961, Japan was unable to join due to Soviet opposition.
    However, when Shiina visited the Soviet Union earlier this year, he requested Soviet assistance on this issue, so "the Soviet attitude is changing," and Japan "has the possibility of participating in this conference."

    日苏加紧勾结的又一步骤
    佐藤政府企图在苏联帮忙下挤入裁军会议
    新华社东京二十日电　日本佐藤政府正企图在苏联修正主义集团的支持下，挤进日内瓦裁军会议，以便帮助美苏搞成“防止核扩散”协定来反对中国。
    据报道，日本外务大臣椎名悦三郎十九日在参议院内阁委员会上说：“为了提高在裁减核军备问题上的发言权，日本要争取参加日内瓦裁军会议”。
    日本外务省联合国局长星文七表示：“日本希望尽早实现防止核扩散协定”。
    《产经新闻》二十日透露，日本将在苏联外交部长葛罗米柯五月中旬访问日本时，同苏联讨论日本参加日内瓦裁军会议的问题。
    这家报纸说，在一九六一年建立裁军会议时，日本由于苏联的反对没能加入。
    但是，今年初椎名访苏时曾要求苏联在这一问题上给以协助，所以“苏联态度正在变化”，日本就“有了参加这一会议的可能性”。
