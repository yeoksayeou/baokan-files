    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th – The Korean Central News Agency, citing news from South Korea, reported that students in Seoul, disregarding the "state of emergency" declared by the Park Chung-hee clique, commemorated the sixth anniversary of the "April 19th" Uprising on the 19th.
    The puppet authorities ordered the closure of all universities on the 19th, preventing students from entering the schools. However, students and some professors of Dongguk University held a memorial meeting in front of the "April 19th" monument on campus on the morning of the 19th.
    After the memorial meeting, teachers and students held an unveiling ceremony for the monument erected for Noh Hee-joo, a student of this university (who sacrificed himself in the "April 19th" Uprising), and Kim Jung-bae, another student (who was beaten to death by police during a demonstration against the "ROK-Japan Treaty" last April).
    At the same time, students from the Law School of Seoul National University held a memorial meeting in front of the monument of Park Dong-hoon, a student of this university who sacrificed himself in the "April 19th" Uprising, on campus.
    Students from the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences of Seoul National University went to Cheonho-dong in Seongdong-gu, Seoul, to hold a memorial meeting in front of the tomb of their classmate Kim Chi-ho (who sacrificed himself in the April 19th Uprising).
    Similar memorial meetings were held at other universities.
    The puppet authorities ordered all police in Seoul to be on standby on the 19th and dispatched riot police to stand guard at all police posts in the city.
    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 19th – According to reports here on the 19th, people from all walks of life in Pyongyang held a rally on the evening of the 18th to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the "April 19th" Uprising of the South Korean people.
    Korean party and government leaders Hong Myung-hee, Lee Joo-yeon, Park Shin-deok, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, Choe Won-taek, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, Baek Nam-un, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and others attended the rally.
    Hong Soon-kwon, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Socialist Working Youth League, made a report at the meeting. He said that the "April 19th" Uprising was a great outburst of anger of the South Korean people against US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, and their just struggle for a new life and for freedom and liberation.
    Hong Soon-kwon said that because there was no leadership from a revolutionary party, the fruits of the South Korean people's struggle, paid for with blood, were usurped by Park Chung-hee, another running dog of US imperialism.
    In his speech, Hong Soon-kwon strongly condemned the criminal activities of US imperialism in directing the Park Chung-hee clique to send troops to South Vietnam and the crime of Japanese militarism re-invading South Korea.
    He said that the only way for the South Korean people to finally get rid of their slave status is to force the US invading forces to withdraw from South Korea, strive for national liberation, and thoroughly complete the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal democratic revolution tasks.
    Hong Soon-kwon said that in order to achieve victory in the struggle, the South Korean people must unite closely and resolutely struggle under the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party. People from all walks of life in South Korea must unite firmly under the banner of the anti-American, anti-Japanese, and national salvation united front, and ignite the flames of patriotic struggle even higher. He said that the people in the northern half of the Republic stand unswervingly on the side of the South Korean people, and the people of the world unanimously support and support the patriotic and just struggle of the South Korean people.
    According to reports, commemorative meetings were also held in the locations of each province in Korea on the occasion of the sixth anniversary of "April 19th."

    南朝鲜学生纷纷纪念“四·一九”六周年
    平壤各界集会支持南朝鲜人民正义斗争
    新华社平壤十九日电  朝鲜中央通讯社引用南朝鲜的消息报道说，汉城的学生不顾朴正熙集团所宣布的“紧急状态”令，十九日纷纷纪念“四·一九”起义六周年。
    傀儡当局十九日下令关闭各大学，不让学生进入学校。但是东国大学的学生和一些教授十九日上午在校园内的“四·一九”纪念碑前举行了纪念会。
    纪念会之后，师生们为这个大学的学生卢熙柱（他是在“四·一九”起义中牺牲的）和另一个学生金重培（他是在去年四月举行反对“韩日条约”的示威游行时被警察打死的）所竖立的纪念碑举行了揭幕典礼。
    同时，汉城大学法学院学生在校园内在“四·一九”起义中牺牲的这所大学的学生朴东勋的纪念碑前举行了纪念会。
    汉城大学文理学院的学生前往汉城城东区的千户洞，在他们的同学金致浩（四·一九起义中牺牲的）的墓前举行了纪念会。
    在其他各大学也举行了同样纪念会。
    傀儡当局十九日下令汉城的全部警察伺机待命，并且派出机动警察在市内所有的警岗上站岗放哨。
    据新华社平壤十九日电　据这里报纸十九日报道，平壤市各界群众十八日晚上举行集会，纪念南朝鲜人民“四·一九”起义六周年。
    朝鲜党政领导人洪命熹、李周渊以及天道教青友党中央委员会委员长朴信德，最高人民会议议长崔元泽、最高人民会议常任委员会副委员长白南云等出席了集会。
    朝鲜社会主义劳动青年同盟中央委员会委员长洪淳权在会上作了报告。他说，“四·一九”起义是南朝鲜人民对美帝国主义和李承晚集团的愤怒的大爆发，是他们要求新生活以及争取自由和解放的正义斗争。
    洪淳权说，由于没有革命政党的领导，南朝鲜人民以鲜血换来的斗争果实被美帝国主义的另一条走狗——朴正熙所篡夺。
    洪淳权在讲话中强烈谴责了美帝国主义指使朴正熙集团向南越派兵的罪恶活动以及日本军国主义重新侵入南朝鲜的罪行。
    他说，南朝鲜人民最终摆脱奴隶地位的唯一道路，在于迫使美国侵略军撤出南朝鲜，争取民族解放，彻底地完成反帝反封建的民主革命任务。
    洪淳权说，南朝鲜人民为了在斗争中取得胜利，必须在马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，紧密地团结起来，坚决地进行斗争。南朝鲜各界人民必须牢固地团结在反美反日救国统一战线的旗帜下，更高地燃起爱国斗争的烈火。他说，共和国北半部人民坚定不移地站在南朝鲜人民一边，全世界人民一致支持和声援南朝鲜人民的爱国正义斗争。
    据报道，在“四·一九”六周年的时候，朝鲜各道所在地也都分别举行了纪念会。
