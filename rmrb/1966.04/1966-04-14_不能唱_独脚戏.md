    Cannot Perform a "One-Man Show"
    Shanghai Silk Textile Factory Political Department
    Since last year, under the direct leadership and assistance of the factory Party committee, the Party branch of the Spinning Workshop of the Shanghai Silk Textile Factory has strengthened the self-construction of the Party branch and given play to the "locomotive" role of all Party members. Through extensively studying Chairman Mao's works, vigorously grasping political ideology, and establishing models, the spiritual outlook of all workers in the workshop has undergone great changes. In the second half of last year, six quality indicators of this workshop reached the highest level in history.

    The Burden of Branch Work Shouldered by Everyone
    The fighting bastion role of the Spinning Workshop branch was not prominent in the past. The branch committee did not meet regularly, and even when meetings were held, the branch secretary always performed a "one-man show." At most, the workshop director (branch committee member) would talk about administrative tasks, and other branch committee members rarely spoke. Afterwards, they would do what they could, and if they couldn't, they would push it onto the branch secretary. Usually, the branch secretary was extremely busy, and the branch committee members were depressed. The branch secretary blamed the branch committee members for not helping to shoulder the burden, and the branch committee members complained that the branch secretary did not solve problems. However, the situation has been different for more than a year. How did they change the situation?

    They studied "Methods of Work of Party Committees," in light of the question of how to hold good branch committee meetings, and clarified the principle of collective leadership of the branch committee. Comrade Xue Jindi, the branch secretary, took the lead. Before each branch committee meeting, she first met with each branch committee member to exchange opinions, so that everyone was prepared when the meeting was held. Branch committee members could also confide in each other when they had opinions. With the branch committee meetings held well, the responsibilities of each branch committee member were also clarified. They adopted a system of assigning shifts for contracting tasks, unified leadership, assigned each branch committee member to a class, shouldering the burden on behalf of the branch committee, implementing the system of collective leadership and division of labor and responsibility, changing the past phenomenon of handing over everything, big or small, to the branch secretary.

    The branch secretary also took the lead in participating in group point labor. Although Xue Jindi came from a loom operator background, she did not go deep into the groups enough in the past, had little contact with the masses, and did not know much about the situation. After she was assigned to go deep into a point based on the decision of the branch committee, her relationship with the masses became closer, she learned more about the situation, and she solved problems in a timely manner. For example, when she went to the singeing group to work at a selected spot, she found that the workers were not accustomed to using the improved singeing machine protective cover, and believed that the glass was easily stained with dust and could not be seen clearly. In addition to doing persuasive work, she also personally carried water to wipe the glass. She also summarized the operational experience of the masses in doing cleaning work with their hands, and organized timely promotion, solving the problem of being unaccustomed to using the singeing machine protective cover. The actions of the branch secretary at the point also drove the workshop director, other branch committee members, and workshop cadres. The transformation of leadership style has promoted closer relations between the Party and the masses, and between cadres and the masses, and a new atmosphere of vigor and vitality has emerged in the entire workshop.

    The branch committee also insisted on democratic life, carried out criticism and self-criticism, so that the branch leadership core was united. The branch committee meets once a week, and before the meeting, they insist on studying a section of Comrade Mao Zedong's relevant works, compare their thoughts, and put opinions on the table for discussion. Before each Party member meeting, the branch committee also carried out criticism and self-criticism among the branch committee members in conjunction with summarizing the work. At the life meeting, the branch secretary always took the lead in making self-criticism and sincerely solicited the opinions of other committee members. The branch committee members were deeply moved. Branch committee member Zhang Guiying said: "We cannot only blame the branch secretary for not doing a good job, everyone has a responsibility. In the future, I must take on the branch work!" Other branch committee members also studied Chairman Mao's works, often carried out criticism and self-criticism, improved their understanding, and changed their style, thereby greatly enhancing the unity of the branch committee and improving the combat effectiveness of the branch.

    Party Members Should Lead the Masses Forward
    Not only does the branch leadership core take the lead in revolution, but it also uses Mao Zedong Thought to conduct high-standard, strict education for Party members, improve the political consciousness of the Party members' proletarian vanguard, and give play to the exemplary role of Party members among the masses.

    In the first half of last year, the factory Party committee called on all factory workers to practice basic skills, carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, in order to meet the requirements of the new high tide of production. However, at that time, many people had thoughts of fear of difficulty. The Party branch seized the advanced example of Party member Wang Mulan, who broke superstition and successfully carried out a small innovation of cleaning tools, and first widely introduced it within the Party, focusing on Wang Mulan's starting from the actual production situation, aiming at the contradiction between the high requirements for cleaning work in production and the backwardness of existing cleaning tools, and wholeheartedly wanting to innovate, finally getting inspiration from the radio wave tuning device and making a simple semi-automatic cleaner. The introduction of this example caused a great shock among Party members, who said that they wanted to learn from Wang Mulan. Some went home to discuss design with their spouses, and some took time to run to second-hand stalls to find materials. Five of the seven Party members in the fine spinning three class became active innovators. Because Party members took the lead, they promoted the technological innovation and technological revolution of the entire workshop, and the entire workshop immediately completed 44 large and small innovations, which greatly promoted production.

    When implementing the principle of "quality first" and deeply carrying out the competition of comparing, learning, catching up, and helping each other, some Party members were more concerned about the quality of their products, but not enough concerned about the masses or helped them. The branch believed that in order to widely organize the masses to participate in the competition, it was necessary to mobilize Party members to do a good job of uniting the masses in the competition. Therefore, we summarized and publicized the advanced deeds of Party member Wang Dashai, who set an example, was meticulous about quality, and took the initiative to help young workers improve their skills and do a good job of handover, educating all Party members in the workshop. Since then, 57 of the 63 Party members have taken the initiative to contact the masses and do family visits. Because the majority of Party members actively did ideological and political work for the masses, timely understood the sufferings of the masses, solved the difficulties of the masses, and improved the relationship between the Party and the masses, they also stimulated the enthusiasm of the masses. In these activities, the Party members were further educated in turn.

    The Key Lies in Studying Chairman Mao's Works Well
    The branch realized that the most fundamental way to improve the proletarian political consciousness of Party members is to organize Party members to study Chairman Mao's works well and handle affairs according to Mao Zedong Thought. The branch committee puts organizing the study of Chairman Mao's works at the top of all work. When holding branch committee meetings, they often first study a section of Comrade Mao Zedong's relevant quotations or articles, use Mao Zedong Thought to check and study work, and solve problems in work. The serious attitude of the branch committee in studying sets an example for all Party members. At the same time, the branch is also very concerned about the situation of Party members studying Chairman Mao's works, and constantly educates Party members to improve the awareness of studying. Whenever a branch meeting or a Party group meeting is held, the issue of studying Chairman Mao's works must be discussed; if a group that studies Chairman Mao's works well is found, the experience is summarized and promoted in a timely manner. The atmosphere of Party members paying attention to studying Chairman Mao's works quickly drove the masses.

    不能唱“独脚戏”
    上海绢纺织厂政治处
    上海绢纺织厂纺丝车间党支部，去年以来，在厂党委的直接领导和帮助下，加强了党支部的自身建设工作，发挥了全体党员的“火车头”作用。通过大学毛主席著作，大抓政治思想和大树标兵，全车间职工的精神面貌发生了很大的变化，去年下半年这个车间有六个质量指标达到了历史上最高的水平。
    支部工作的担子大家挑起来
    纺丝车间支部的战斗堡垒作用，以前是并不显著的。支委会没有经常开，就是开了会，也总是支部书记唱“独脚戏”，顶多车间主任（支部委员）谈一下行政任务，其他支部委员很少发言。事后往往能做则做，不能做就往支部书记头上推。平时，支部书记忙煞急煞，支部委员苦闷煞；支部书记责怪支部委员不帮助挑这担子，支部委员埋怨支部书记不解决问题。但是，一年多来，情况不同了。他们是怎样改变局面的呢？
    他们带着怎样开好支委会的问题，学习《党委会的工作方法》，联系对照，明确了支委会的集体领导原则。支部书记薛金娣同志带头行动。每次支委会前，她先与各支部委员碰头，交换意见，这样，开会时大家有了思想准备。支部委员间有意见也能相互交心。支委会开好了，每个支部委员的职责也明确了。他们采取分班包干，统一领导，把每个支部委员分到班里，代表支委会担起担子，贯彻了支委会集体领导和分工负责制度，改变了过去不管大小事都上交给支部书记的现象。
    支部书记还带头参加小组蹲点劳动。薛金娣虽是挡车工出身，但过去深入小组不够，与群众联系少，情况了解不多。她根据支委会决定分工深入蹲点后，与群众关系密切了，情况了解多了，解决问题也及时了。例如，她到烧毛小组蹲点，发现工人对使用革新后的烧毛机防护罩不习惯，认为玻璃容易沾灰看不清。她除了做说服工作外，还亲自拎水擦玻璃。她还总结了群众双手做清洁工作的操作经验，及时组织推广，解决了烧毛机防护罩使用不习惯的问题。支部书记蹲点的行动，也带动了车间主任、其他支部委员和车间干部。领导作风的转变，促使党群、干群关系更加密切了，整个车间出现了朝气蓬勃的新气象。
    支委会还坚持民主生活，开展批评与自我批评，使支部领导核心团结一致。每周开一次支委会，会前坚持学习一段毛泽东同志的有关著作，对照思想，做到有意见放到桌面上谈。每当开党员大会前，支部结合总结工作，支部委员之间也开展批评与自我批评。在生活会上，支部书记总是带头作自我批评，并诚恳地征求其他委员的意见，支部委员深受感动。支部委员张桂英说：“我们工作没有做好，不能只怪支部书记，大家都有责任，今后我一定要把支部工作担当起来！”其他支部委员也都学习毛主席著作，经常开展批评与自我批评，提高了认识，改变了作风，从而大大增强了支委会的团结，提高了支部的战斗力。
    党员要带领群众前进
    支部领导核心不但带头革命，还用毛泽东思想对党员进行高标准、严格的教育，提高党员无产阶级先锋队的政治觉悟，发挥党员在群众中的模范作用。
    去年上半年，厂党委号召全厂职工要大练基本功，开展技术革新和技术革命，以适应生产新高潮的要求。但当时有不少群众存在着畏难思想。党支部便抓住党员王木兰破除迷信搞成清洁工具小革新的先进事例，先在党内广为介绍，着重谈了王木兰从生产实际出发，针对生产上清洁工作要求高与现有清洁工具落后的矛盾，一心想革新，终于从无线电调波装置得到启发，搞成了一个简便的半自动清洁器。这个事例一介绍，在党员中震动很大，纷纷表示要向王木兰学习。有的回家同自己爱人一起商量设计，有的抽空跑旧货摊找材料，精纺三班七个党员有五个党员成了搞革新的积极分子。由于党员带头，推动了整个车间的技术革新和技术革命，全车间一下搞成大小革新四十四项，对生产起了很大的促进作用。
    当贯彻好字当头，深入开展比学赶帮超竞赛时，有些党员对自己的产品质量比较关心，但关心群众、帮助群众不够。支部认为要广泛地组织群众投入竞赛，必须发动党员做好竞赛中团结群众的工作。于是，我们便总结和宣传了党员王大筛以身作则，对质量一丝不苟和主动帮助青工提高技术，做好交接班的先进事迹，教育了全车间党员。从此以后，在六十三个党员中有五十七个党员都主动去联系群众，做家庭访问工作。由于广大党员积极做群众的思想政治工作，及时了解群众疾苦，解决群众困难，改善了党群关系，也激发了群众的积极性。在这些活动中，反过来又进一步教育了党员。
    关键在于学好毛主席著作
    支部认识到提高党员无产阶级政治觉悟的最根本的一条，是组织党员学习好毛主席著作，按毛泽东思想办事。支委会把组织学习毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位，开支委会时，常常是先学习一节毛泽东同志的有关语录或文章，用毛泽东思想检查、研究工作，解决工作中的问题。支委会认真学习的态度给全体党员树立了样板。同时，支部也十分关心党员学习毛主席著作的情况，不断地教育党员提高学习的自觉性。开一次支部大会或开一次党小组会，都要讨论学习毛主席著作的问题；发现学习毛主席著作好的小组，就及时总结经验，及时推广。党员重视学毛主席著作的风气很快带动了群众。
