    Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to our friendly neighbor Afghanistan has come to a successful conclusion. During the visit, Chairman Liu Shaoqi received a grand and cordial welcome and hospitality from King Mohammed Zahir Shah of Afghanistan, the Afghan government, and the Afghan people. Through Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit, the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan and the deep friendship between the Chinese and Afghan peoples have been further developed. The Chinese people are sincerely happy about this.

    The exchanges between China and Afghanistan began more than two thousand years ago. In the history of the two countries over this long period, it is full of stories of friendship, and there have never been conflicts or disputes. In 1955, the People's Republic of China established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom of Afghanistan, advancing the traditional friendship between our two countries to a new stage. The mutual visits of leaders of the two countries and the increasing and frequent economic and cultural exchanges have given new content and new vitality to Sino-Afghan friendship.

    China and Afghanistan have different social systems. However, our two countries share common aspirations and are making joint efforts in safeguarding national independence and sovereignty, developing our respective national economies, and defending peace in Asia and the world. In particular, the Chinese government and the Afghan government treat each other with sympathy and support in handling relations between the two countries, taking the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guiding principle. This is a reliable guarantee for the continuous enhancement of friendly relations between China and Afghanistan.

    Today, almost everywhere in the world, people are talking about "peaceful coexistence." The colors of brass and gold are the same, but they are composed of completely different elements. Therefore, brass is ultimately brass, and gold is ultimately gold. In the treaties or agreements signed by China with Afghanistan and many other Asian and African countries, peaceful coexistence is given a precise definition. These are the famous Five Principles: mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. The Chinese government has always respected Afghanistan's independence and neutral status. Similarly, the Kingdom of Afghanistan also respects China's sovereignty and opposes the imperialist plot to create "two Chinas." China and Afghanistan both faithfully adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, seeking common ground while reserving differences, and engaging in friendly cooperation. As Chairman Liu Shaoqi said during his visit to Afghanistan: "We will not do anything that harms you. You will not do anything that harms us. Mutual respect and the development of friendly relations between our two countries are beneficial to both our peoples."

    Based on China's population and size, people often refer to China as a major power. The Chinese government and people have always believed that all countries, regardless of size, are equal. Some people advocate that two or several major powers should solve international problems. This kind of "great power politics" is actually power politics: whoever is strong can impose their will on others and can bully and oppress other countries. The Chinese government and people resolutely oppose a few major powers monopolizing international affairs and resolutely oppose a few major powers acting like overlords. At the state banquet held by King Zahir Shah, Chairman Liu Shaoqi said: "We oppose major countries discriminating against, looking down upon, and bullying small countries. World issues can only be decided jointly by all countries in the world, and it is absolutely not allowed for a few major powers to take care of everything." Before liberation, China had long been subjected to aggression and oppression by the so-called "powers," that is, the imperialist countries that styled themselves as "major powers." Today, this situation is gone forever, and the Chinese people have stood up. However, we deeply abhor great-power chauvinism. We do not allow others to treat us with a great-power chauvinistic attitude, and we absolutely do not allow ourselves to treat other countries with a great-power chauvinistic attitude. For more than a decade, in our dealings with Afghanistan, Asian and African countries, socialist countries, and other countries, we have handled relations between countries in this spirit.

    The fact that China and Afghanistan live in harmony powerfully demonstrates that on the basis of the Five Principles, countries with different social systems can fully achieve peaceful coexistence and can continuously enhance mutual cooperation and friendly relations. What hinders and undermines peaceful coexistence is imperialism and new and old colonialism, as well as expansionism and great-power chauvinism. Therefore, as the China-Afghanistan Joint Communiqué pointed out, "The complete victory of countries and peoples striving for national independence and self-determination through the elimination of new and old colonialism and the eradication of colonial remnants is the fundamental condition for guaranteeing peaceful coexistence and lasting peace."

    The joint communiqué between China and Afghanistan highly praised the Sino-Afghan Treaty of Friendship and Non-Aggression signed in 1960 and expressed satisfaction with the development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. Following Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit to Afghanistan, Afghan Prime Minister Maiwandwal will also visit our country at the invitation of Premier Zhou Enlai. All of these reflect the deep friendship between the peoples of the two countries and express the common aspirations of the two peoples. We firmly believe that the friendly and cooperative relations between China and Afghanistan will be further consolidated and developed in the years to come.

### 中国阿富汗友谊发展的新标志

    中国阿富汗友谊发展的新标志
    刘少奇主席在我们的友好邻邦阿富汗的访问，已经圆满结束。访问期间，刘少奇主席受到了阿富汗国王穆罕默德·查希尔·沙阿、阿富汗政府和阿富汗人民隆重、亲切的欢迎和款待。通过刘少奇主席的这次访问，中、阿两国的友好合作关系，中、阿人民的深厚友谊，都有了进一步的发展。中国人民对此感到由衷的高兴。
    中国和阿富汗之间的交往，开始于两千多年以前。在这漫长岁月的两国关系史中，充满了友谊的佳话，而从未发生过冲突或争端。一九五五年，中华人民共和国同阿富汗王国建立了外交关系，把我们两国的传统友谊推进到一个新阶段。两国领导人的相互访问，经济往来、文化交流的日益增进和频繁，都赋予了中、阿友谊以新的内容和新的活力。
    中国和阿富汗的社会制度是不相同的。但是，我们两国在维护国家的独立和主权，发展本国的民族经济，捍卫亚洲和世界的和平，在所有这些方面，都抱有共同的愿望，进行着共同的努力。特别是，中国政府和阿富汗政府在处理两国关系时，相互同情，相互支持，以和平共处五项原则作为准绳。这是中、阿两国友好关系不断增进的可靠保障。
    今天，几乎在世界的各个地方，都有人在谈论“和平共处”。黄铜和金子的颜色是相同的，但是，它们是由迥然不同的原素构成的。因而，黄铜毕竟是黄铜，金子终究是金子。中国同阿富汗以及许多亚非国家签订的条约或协定中，给予了和平共处以确切的定义。这就是著名的五项原则：互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处。中国政府一贯尊重阿富汗的独立和中立地位。同样，阿富汗王国政府也尊重中国的主权，反对帝国主义制造“两个中国”的阴谋。中、阿两国都忠实地遵循和平共处五项原则，求同存异，友好合作。正如刘少奇主席在访问阿富汗时所说的：“我们不做损害你们的事情。你们也不做损害我们的事情。我们两国互相尊重，发展友好关系，对我们两国人民都是有利的。”
    人们根据中国的人口和幅员，常常把中国称为大国。中国政府和人民一贯认为，国家不论大小，都是一律平等的。有人鼓吹两个大国或几个大国来解决国际问题。这种“大国政治”，实际上就是强权政治：谁强大，谁就可以把自己的意志强加于人，就可以欺凌和压迫别的国家。中国政府和人民坚决反对少数大国垄断国际事务，坚决反对少数大国称王称霸。在查希尔·沙阿国王举行的国宴上，刘少奇主席说：“我们反对大国歧视和蔑视小国、欺压小国。世界问题只能由世界各国来共同决定，绝不容许少数大国来包办。”解放前的中国，曾经长期受到所谓“列强”、也就是那些自命为“大国”的帝国主义国家的侵略和压迫。今天，这种情况已经一去不复返了，中国人民已经站起来了。但是，我们对大国沙文主义，是深恶痛绝的。我们不容许别人再用大国沙文主义的态度对待我们，同样，也绝不容许我们自己用大国沙文主义的态度对待其他国家。十几年来，在同阿富汗、亚非国家、社会主义国家和其他国家的交往中，我们都是本着这一精神来处理国与国之间的关系的。
    中、阿两国和睦相处的事实有力地说明，在五项原则的基础上，不同社会制度的国家是完全可以实现和平共处的，是完全可以不断地增进相互间的合作和友好关系的。阻碍和破坏和平共处的，是帝国主义和新老殖民主义，以及扩张主义和大国沙文主义。因此，正如中国—阿富汗联合公报所指出的，“消灭新老殖民主义，肃清殖民主义残余，争取民族独立和自决权利的国家和人民获得完全胜利，是保障和平共处和持久和平的根本条件。”
    中、阿两国的联合公报，高度地评价了在一九六○年签订的中阿友好和互不侵犯条约，并对两国友好合作关系的发展表示满意。在刘少奇主席访问阿富汗之后，阿富汗首相迈万德瓦尔又应周恩来总理的邀请，将来我国访问。所有这些，都体现了两国人民的深厚友谊，表达了两国人民的共同愿望。我们深信，中、阿两国的友好合作关系，在未来的岁月中，必将会进一步地巩固和发展。
