    From the Surface to the Essence
    Emphasizing politics requires grasping living ideas. By truly delving into the masses' production and lives, one finds a wealth of living ideas.

    Not long ago, Zhao Gezhuang Commune in Fangshan County implemented an early-maturing crop planting plan and discovered that some production teams, despite having better water conservancy conditions, were unwilling to plant more. Why? Some said that switching from one crop to two crops would make labor too strenuous. Others said that planting more would be good, but there wasn't enough fertilizer. It seemed that the main problem preventing increased planting was fertilizer and labor. But this was not actually the case. When the commune Party secretary labored and chatted with the commune members, he heard them discussing: "It's enough to have enough to eat, why expand to two crops and suffer that much?" The commune Party secretary seized upon this living idea and, after analysis, found that this thinking was very representative. Therefore, he organized all the commune cadres and members to launch a "farming for whom" discussion, greatly raising people's awareness of farming for the revolution. The planting of early-maturing crops increased by two times the original plan.

    How to grasp living ideas? There is much to be learned in this regard.

                                      Beijing　Liu　Ying
    The question raised by Comrade Liu Ying is extremely important. Many comrades understand that emphasizing politics requires doing the work of people; to do the work of people well, one must grasp living ideas. How can one grasp living ideas? If one only sees some superficial phenomena, one cannot accurately grasp living ideas. By seriously analyzing various phenomena "from the surface to the essence," one can grasp living ideas. Whether or not we can do this depends on whether we have a clear class viewpoint and keen political vision, and whether we go deep into the masses and into reality. Whether or not we emphasize politics and whether or not we can do a good job of people's ideological work often hinges on this.

    由表及里
    突出政治，就要抓活思想。真正深入到群众的生产生活中去，活思想真是多得很。
    不久前，房山县赵各庄公社落实早熟作物播种计划，发现有些生产队尽管有较好的水利条件，但不愿多种。什么原因？有的说，一茬变两茬，劳力忙不过来。有的说，多种倒是好，就是肥料少。看来不能多种主要是肥料、劳力的问题了。实则不然，当公社党委书记同社员一起劳动、聊天的时候，就听到社员们议论：“够吃就算啦，扩大两茬干什么，受那份累？”公社党委书记抓住这个活思想一分析，发现这种想法很有代表性，于是就组织全公社干部社员展开了一场“为谁种田”的大讨论，大大提高了人们为革命种田的觉悟，早熟作物比原计划增加了两倍。
    怎样抓活思想？这里边大有学问。
                                      北京　刘　英
    刘英同志提出的问题，十分重要。很多同志都了解，突出政治，就要做人的工作；要做好人的工作，就要抓活思想。怎样才能抓到活思想？只看到一些表面现象，活思想是摸不准抓不住的。认真对各种现象作一番“由表及里”的分析功夫，活思想就能抓到。能不能做到这一点，这就要看我们有没有鲜明的阶级观点和敏锐的政治眼光，要看我们是否深入群众、深入实际。突出不突出政治，能不能做好人的思想工作，问题往往发生在这里。
