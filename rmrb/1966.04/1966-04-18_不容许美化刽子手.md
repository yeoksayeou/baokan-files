    No Glorification of Butchers Allowed
    Cheng Manlin, Dongcheng District Service Company, Beijing Municipality
    The more I watch the movie "Siege," the angrier I get. It paints the enemy in a flattering light everywhere, smears our army, and sings high praises for senior Kuomintang officers.
    Chairman Mao said that the enemy will not fall unless they are struck down. The film says that the enemy can fall without being struck, that they can lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot. Chairman Mao taught us that we should use the viewpoint of class analysis to recognize the nature of the enemy, that the enemy is anti-Communist and anti-people. Are enemy Division Commander Zhao Chongwu and Regiment Commander Zheng Hanchen really as patriotic and people-loving as the film claims? Will they really automatically lay down their butcher knives and become Buddhas on the spot? No. The exploiting class is the exploiting class. Their philosophy is: unless the poor are killed, the rich will not become richer. Reactionary officers are reactionary officers. They are all butchers with hands stained with the blood of the people, robbers who oppress the masses and plunder the people. But the film glorifies the murdering robbers Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen in every possible way.
    In the film, Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen are not cruel butchers and savage robbers, but kind and honest, forthright and upright, people-loving officials, bodhisattvas who are supported by their subordinates and loved by the masses. Zhao Chongwu can swallow his anger for the sake of ten thousand hometown youths; Zheng Hanchen would rather let his troops starve and risk grabbing an airlift than infringe upon the interests of the masses, letting his subordinates return the looted grain to the people, winning the "villagers'" gratitude with kowtows. It is because of this that the small soldier carried Zheng's wife across the river when encountering water, risked his life to conceal the truth for Zheng Hanchen, and was captured by our People's Liberation Army three times without surrendering, forever following Zheng Hanchen.
    It can be clearly seen that the screenwriter and director do not love what the people love and hate what the people hate, but completely sit on the side of the reactionary officers Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanchen. Such glorification of the enemy is nothing more than making the audience believe that not all class enemies are bad, and there are still good people like Zhao and Zheng who will automatically lay down their butcher knives. In that case, what is the need for us to engage in armed struggle and class struggle!

    不容许美化刽子手
    北京市东城区服务公司　程满麟
    《兵临城下》这部电影我越看越生气。它处处给敌军脸上搽粉，给我军脸上抹黑，为国民党高级军官大唱赞歌。
    毛主席说敌人不打不倒，影片说敌人不打可以倒，自己会放下屠刀，立地成佛；毛主席教导我们说应该用阶级分析的观点认清敌人本性，敌人是反共反人民的，影片说国民党高级军官是爱国、爱人民的。敌师长赵崇武、团长郑汉臣真的象影片中所宣扬的那样爱国爱人民吗？真的会自动放下屠刀，立地成佛吗？不。剥削阶级就是剥削阶级，他们的哲学是不杀穷人不富。反动军官就是反动军官，他们都是两手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手，是压迫群众、抢劫人民的强盗。而影片中对杀人的强盗赵崇武、郑汉臣却进行了百般美化。
    影片中的赵崇武、郑汉臣并不是残酷的刽子手和野蛮的强盗，而是忠厚善良、爽快正直、爱民如子的菩萨，是受部下士兵拥护，受群众爱戴的“清官”。赵崇武为了一万名家乡子弟可以忍气吞声；郑汉臣宁可让自己的部队忍饥挨饿，冒险抢空投也不侵犯群众利益，让部下把抢来的粮食退给老百姓，赢得了“老乡”的叩头感恩。正因为这样，小个子兵才遇水背郑太太过河，冒生命危险为郑汉臣隐瞒真情，以至三次被我人民解放军俘虏而不投降，永远追随于郑汉臣。
    可以清楚看出，编导者不是爱人民之所爱，恨人民之所恨，完全把屁股坐到反动军官赵崇武、郑汉臣那一边了。这样美化敌人无非是让观众相信：阶级敌人并不都坏，也还有象赵、郑这样的好人，他们会自动放下屠刀的。这样，我们还需要搞什么武装斗争和阶级斗争呢！
