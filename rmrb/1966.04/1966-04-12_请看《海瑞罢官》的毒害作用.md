    See the Poisonous Effects of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"
    Tang Zujiang, Member of the Chengguan People's Commune, Songjiang County
    Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" has had a seriously destructive effect in our rural areas. In Xingjian Brigade of our Chengguan People's Commune, there was a rich peasant element who spread ideas of restoration by promoting Hai Rui.
    In 1961 and 1962, when theaters were performing plays like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" and "Hai Rui's Memorial to the Emperor," this rich peasant went around promoting Hai "upright official," praising his spirit of daring to "criticize." He talked at length about the stories of Hai Rui, using Hai Rui's words to "cry injustice" and "complain" for his own family. See, Comrade Wu Han's talk of "redressing unjust verdicts" was in step with the "overturning verdicts" activities of this rich peasant element. That rich peasant also said something like "...Hai Rui's robe was stolen in Songjiang, so Hai Rui privately investigated Baique Temple, and fell into a trap set by the monks and was captured, pressed under a large bell. Later, Baique Temple was destroyed, Hai Rui was rescued, and the abbot and monks were arrested and dealt with according to law... I am like Hai Rui now; he was pressed under the bell, and I am under supervised labor." Listen! The counter-revolutionary thinking of this rich peasant element is extremely blatant and naked. This rich peasant element also once told a young commune member about how Hai Rui once removed three "Grand Secretaries." "...You are a poor peasant, and you have been very active in your work since liberation. Why are you always just a commune member? If you want to be a cadre, you must learn from Hai Rui and remove three 'Grand Secretaries.' You have to 'criticize' the militia platoon leader, the production team leader, and the production team accountant. If you 'criticize' them down, you can become a cadre. Even if you don't become a cadre, I will help you out in the future, and if you have financial difficulties, I will lend you money." Look, this is the "Hai Rui spirit" advocated by Comrade Wu Han resurrected in this rich peasant. The heart of this rich peasant element is not dead, and he is drilling everywhere for loopholes, vainly trying to seize back the "seal of power."
    The fact that this rich peasant promoted Hai "upright official" has sounded an alarm for us. This is the means by which class enemies are carrying out "peaceful evolution" against us, and we must not be paralyzed!
    We must always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, always maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance, firmly grasp the proletarian seal of power in the hands of reliable successors, and ensure that our country will never change color for generations to come. From the incident of the rich peasant element promoting Hai Rui that I personally encountered, it can be seen that Comrade Wu Han's "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" is a great poisonous drug that opposes the Party and socialism, and its harmfulness is extremely great. We must never be fooled!

    请看《海瑞罢官》的毒害作用
    松江县城关公社社员　唐祖江
    吴晗同志写的《海瑞罢官》，在我们农村曾经起了严重的破坏作用。我们城关公社兴建大队，就有一个富农分子，通过宣扬海瑞来散布变天思想。
    在一九六一年、一九六二年，当戏院里在唱《海瑞罢官》、《海瑞上疏》等戏的时候，这个富农就到处宣传海“清官”，宣扬他的敢“骂”精神。他大讲海瑞的故事，借海瑞之口为自家“鸣冤”“叫苦”。请看，吴晗同志大讲“平冤狱”，同这个富农分子的“翻案”活动脚碰脚了。那个富农还讲啥“……海瑞的袍子被人偷到松江，海瑞就私行察访白雀寺，因跌入机关被和尚所擒，压在大钟底下。后来大破白雀寺，海瑞得救，捉拿法师和尚法办……我现在与海瑞一样，他压在钟下，我被监督劳动。”请听！这个富农分子的变天思想是十分露骨的、赤裸裸的。这个富农分子还曾经向一青年社员讲海瑞一朝扳掉三“阁老”。“……你是贫农，解放以来工作非常积极，为啥老是做一个社员，要做干部就要学海瑞的样，扳掉三‘阁老’。你要对民兵排长、生产队长、生产队会计‘骂’。‘骂’下来了就可当干部，即使当不上干部，今后替你拎一把，生活困难钱借给你。”请看，这就是吴晗同志所提倡的“海瑞精神”在这个富农身上借尸还魂了。这个富农分子心是不死的，一有空子就到处钻，妄想夺回“印把子”。
    这个富农宣传海“清官”这一个事实，给我们敲起了警钟。这就是阶级敌人对我们搞“和平演变”的手段，我们千万麻痹不得！
    我们一定要永远高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，永远保持高度的革命警惕性，把无产阶级的印把子牢牢地掌握在可靠的接班人手里，保证我们的国家世世代代永不变颜色。从我亲身所遇到的富农分子宣传海瑞这件事中，可以看出吴晗同志的《海瑞罢官》是一帖反党反社会主义的大毒药，危害性是极大极大的，我们千万不能上当啊！
