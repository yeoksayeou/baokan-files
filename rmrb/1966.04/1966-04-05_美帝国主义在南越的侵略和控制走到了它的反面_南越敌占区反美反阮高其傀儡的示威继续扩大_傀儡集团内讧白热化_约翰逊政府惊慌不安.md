    American Imperialism in South Vietnam's Aggression and Control Has Reached Its Opposite
    Anti-American and Anti-Nguyen Cao Ky Puppet Demonstrations Continue to Expand in Enemy-Occupied Areas of South Vietnam
    Infighting Within the Puppet Clique Intensifies; Johnson Administration Alarmed and Uneasy
    (Xinhua News Agency, Saigon, 4th) News: In the cities of the American-puppet controlled areas of South Vietnam, demonstrations against the United States and the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime continue to develop. At the same time, infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique is also becoming increasingly tense, reaching a fever pitch.
    According to Western news agencies, people in South Vietnamese cities controlled by the American puppets, including Da Lat, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, and Hue, continue to hold anti-American demonstrations. Three thousand students in Da Lat held a demonstration on the 4th. An Associated Press dispatch said: "Students are demanding the overthrow of the central government (the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime) and that the city no longer be a rest and recreation center for American troops." Fearing the situation would escalate, the American military authorities in Da Lat ordered the American invading forces to "stay in the camps." On the same day, thousands of demonstrators in Nha Trang held a massive demonstration. The American-puppet authorities had to declare martial law. A large number of students in Qui Nhon also held a sit-in demonstration. People in Hue continued to hold demonstrations. A student leader said on the evening of the 3rd: "We oppose the American policy towards Vietnam," "Vietnam (enemy-occupied area of South Vietnam) has become the 51st state of the United States."
    As the demonstrations against the United States and the Nguyen Cao Ky puppet regime by the people in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam continue to rise, the contradictions between the Nguyen Cao Ky group and the Nguyen Chanh Thi group, the puppet 1st Corps commander who was "dismissed" by them on March 10, have further intensified. Nguyen Cao Ky announced at a press conference on the 3rd that he would "take military action" against Da Nang, the city where the 1st Corps headquarters is located, and "take it back into the hands of the government." He said: "At least three battalions of elite paratroopers are ready to move immediately upon notification." He also requisitioned all aircraft of Vietnam Airlines to transport troops to Da Nang.
    In Da Nang, Nguyen Van Man, the puppet "mayor" of Da Nang, who was promoted three months ago by Nguyen Chanh Thi, said after Nguyen Cao Ky announced that he would "take military action" against Da Nang: "If troops are sent, there will probably be street fighting." According to a United Press International dispatch from Da Nang on the 4th, the "Buddhists and students" in Da Nang "armed themselves with sticks and stones and prepared to fight any government troops that Nguyen Cao Ky might send to Da Nang to suppress anti-government demonstrations."
    It is reported that the American ruling clique is extremely alarmed and uneasy about the intensification of the infighting within the South Vietnamese puppet clique, especially the upsurge of the anti-American movement of the people in the enemy-occupied cities of South Vietnam. U.S. Secretary of State Rusk also tried his best to cheer up Nguyen Cao Ky on a television program on the evening of the 3rd. He said, "Despite the current crisis of political turmoil, it seems unlikely that the Nguyen Cao Ky government will collapse because the armed forces hold fundamental power in Saigon." He wanted this disintegrating puppet clique to "cooperate" and quickly establish a so-called "constitutional system." (Attached picture)

    美帝国主义在南越的侵略和控制走到了它的反面
    南越敌占区反美反阮高其傀儡的示威继续扩大
    傀儡集团内讧白热化　约翰逊政府惊慌不安
    据新华社四日讯　西贡消息：南越美伪控制区城市人民反对美国和阮高其傀儡政权的示威继续发展，同时，南越傀儡集团的内讧也剑拔弩张，走向白热化。
    据西方通讯社报道，南越美伪控制城市包括大叻、归仁、芽庄、顺化等地的人民继续举行反美示威。大叻市三千名学生四日举行了示威。美联社的消息说：“学生们要求推翻中央政府（阮高其傀儡政权）和使这个城市不再作为美军休息娱乐中心”。大叻的美军当局害怕事态扩大，要美国侵略军“都呆在营地内”。同一天，芽庄数以千计的示威群众举行声势浩大的示威游行。美伪当局不得不宣布戒严令。归仁市的大批学生也举行了静坐示威。顺化市人民继续举行示威游行，一个学生领导人三日晚发表谈话说：“我们反对美国对越政策”，“越南（南越敌占区）已成为美国的第五十一州”。
    随着南越敌占区人民反对美国和阮高其傀儡政权的示威的不断高涨，阮高其集团同三月十日被他们“革职”的伪第一军军长阮正诗集团之间的矛盾进一步激化。阮高其三日在记者招待会上宣布说，他将对第一军总部所在的城市岘港“采取军事行动”，把它“夺回到政府手中”。他说：“至少有三营精锐的伞兵已作好准备，可以接到通知后马上行动”。他还征用了越南航空公司的所有飞机，准备把军队运到岘港去。
    在岘港方面，三个月以前由阮正诗推荐上台的岘港伪“市长”阮文曼在阮高其宣布要对岘港“采取军事行动”后说：“如果派兵前来，大概会有巷战。”据合众国际社四日发自岘港的消息，岘港市的“佛教徒和学生用棍子和石块把自己武装起来，准备同阮高其可能派来岘港镇压反政府示威的任何政府军队作战。”
    据报道，美国统治集团对南越傀儡集团内讧的激化，特别是南越敌占城市人民反美运动的高涨，极为惊慌不安。美国国务卿腊斯克三日晚上在电视节目中也竭力为阮高其打气。他说，“尽管目前掀起了政治动荡的危机，但是看来阮高其政府不大可能垮台，因为武装部队在西贡掌握着根本权力。”他要这个分崩离析的傀儡集团“应该合作”，并且迅速地建立所谓“立宪体制”。（附图片）
