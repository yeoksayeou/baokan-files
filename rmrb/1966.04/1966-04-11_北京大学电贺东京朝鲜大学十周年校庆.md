    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th. Peking University sent a telegram to Tokyo Korean University on April 10th, warmly congratulating the university on its tenth anniversary and wishing it continuous development and new achievements.
    The telegram said: "Over the past ten years, under the deep concern of the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, your university has made tremendous contributions to the development of national education for the 600,000 Korean residents in Japan. Under the national discrimination and political persecution of the American and Japanese reactionaries, you have not feared violence and have resolutely defended the legitimate rights and interests of all Korean residents in Japan and your university. We deeply admire this."
    The telegram said: "The American and Japanese reactionaries have always regarded the patriotic and anti-imperialist force of the Korean residents in Japan as a thorn in their side. Recently, the Japanese Sato government, continuing to follow U.S. imperialism and intensifying its collusion with the Park Chung-hee clique of South Korea, is using the so-called agreement on the legal status of Korean residents to intensify its persecution of Korean residents in Japan. All those who uphold justice and advocate safeguarding national dignity cannot but express their indignation and condemnation of these criminal acts of the Sato government. All faculty and students of Peking University, together with the people of our country, resolutely support your heroic struggle against national discrimination and political persecution, and we are confident that your struggle will ultimately be victorious."

    北京大学电贺东京朝鲜大学十周年校庆
    新华社十日讯　北京大学十日致电东京朝鲜大学热烈祝贺该校十周年校庆，并祝该校日益发展不断取得新的成就。
    电报说：“十年来，贵校在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的深切关怀下，为发展六十万旅日朝侨的民族教育事业做出了巨大的贡献。你们在美、日反动派的民族歧视和政治迫害下，不畏强暴，坚决维护全体旅日朝侨和贵校自身的正当权益，我们深感钦佩。”
    电报说：“美、日反动派一向把旅日朝侨这支爱国反帝力量视为眼中钉。最近，日本佐藤政府继续追随美帝国主义，加紧勾结南朝鲜朴正熙集团，利用所谓朝侨法律地位问题的协定，正在变本加厉地对旅日朝侨进行迫害。一切主持正义和主张维护民族尊严的人们，不能不对佐藤政府的这些罪恶行为表示愤慨和谴责。我们北京大学的全体师生同我国人民一道，坚决支持你们为反对民族歧视和政治迫害而进行的英勇斗争，并确信你们的斗争终将取得胜利。”
