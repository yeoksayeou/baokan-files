    President Sukarno Has Been Held Hostage by Rightists and Lost His Freedom
    AP Says His Speeches Must Be Reviewed by the Military Before Publication
    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 13th: A dispatch from Jakarta by the Associated Press on April 10th reported that Indonesian President Sukarno has lost his freedom under the surveillance of a group of right-wing generals.
    The dispatch said that President Sukarno "is now a lonely man" and is increasingly isolated from the people. He "sits alone in his luxurious palaces in Jakarta and Bogor." "Only certain visitors are allowed to see him. His telephone calls are screened. His speeches are no longer simultaneously broadcast to the public but are first heard by the military and then released."
    The dispatch said, "At public ceremonies presided over by Sukarno, he sits almost pitifully and lonely under the palace lanterns. Cabinet ministers no longer gather around him to listen to his golden words, and generals no longer rush to him to seek his blessing."
    The dispatch said that President Sukarno used to hold "breakfast meetings where he would meet with ministers and ambassadors. Reporters used to wait daily in the corridors of the palace for his daily schedule of activities. Now it seems that these meetings no longer exist."

    苏加诺总统已被右派挟持丧失自由
    美联社说他的讲话要经军方审查才能发表
    新华社十三日讯　雅加达消息：美联社十日从雅加达发出的一则消息，报道了印度尼西亚苏加诺总统在右派将领集团监视下丧失自由的状况。
    消息说，苏加诺总统“现在是一个孤独的人”，越来越被孤立于人民之外了。他“孤独地坐在他在雅加达和茂物的豪华的宫中。”“只有某些访问者被允许去见他。他所接的电话是经过甄审的。他的讲话已不再同时向公众发表，而是先由军方听，然后才予以发表。”
    消息说，“在苏加诺主持的公开仪式上，他几乎是可怜而孤独地坐在宫灯下面。内阁部长不再聚集在他的周围倾听他的金口玉言，将军们也不再跑到他跟前求得他的祝福。”
    消息说，苏加诺总统过去惯于举行“早餐会议，他在这种会议上会见部长和大使们。记者们惯于每天在宫廷的走廊里等候他的一天活动日程。现在看来这种会议已经没有了。”
