    Xinhua News Agency, Santo Domingo, 24th—Thousands of citizens in Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, held a grand anti-American rally on the afternoon of the 23rd, despite the tight security of a large number of military police, demanding that the American invading troops get out.

    At the rally, the masses angrily denounced the crimes of US imperialism in its armed invasion of the Dominican Republic. The shouts of "Yankees Go Home" shook the earth hundreds of times.

    Above the crowd, the flags of organizations such as the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" and the "Dominican People's Movement" fluttered. Before the rally, these organizations also continuously condemned the Yankee invasion loudly through loudspeakers and called on the people to take to the streets to demonstrate.

    This rally was to commemorate the first anniversary of the people's armed uprising that overthrew the pro-American dictatorial regime of Cabral. As everyone knows, on the fourth day after the outbreak of this thrilling people's uprising on April 24 last year, the United States brazenly dispatched troops to carry out military occupation of the Dominican Republic. Now, people are holding a series of commemorative activities to further mobilize the masses and carry the anti-aggression struggle, which has lasted for a year, through to the end.

    Fearing the protests of the Dominican people, the American invading troops have been ordered not to enter the downtown area of Santo Domingo, but the military police of the "provisional government" fostered by the United States are densely deployed throughout Santo Domingo. Police chief López even threatened to use carbines and tear gas against the masses if necessary. This fully exposes the cowardly and ruthless nature of the American invaders. According to reports, when a group of police from the "provisional government" broke into some houses in Santo Domingo on the 22nd, searched and confiscated a batch of anti-American leaflets, the angry masses beat up two of the policemen.

    Xinhua News Agency, April 24th—The Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee today sent telegrams to the Dominican June 14th Revolutionary Movement and the Dominican People's Movement, respectively, on the first anniversary of the Dominican people's armed uprising to overthrow the Cabral traitorous dictatorial regime, reaffirming the Chinese people's firm support for the Dominican people's just struggle against the United States, against dictatorship, and for the freedom and liberation of their motherland.

    The telegrams from the Chinese People's Committee for World Peace and the Chinese Asian-African Solidarity Committee said: "On the occasion of the first anniversary of the Dominican people's armed uprising to overthrow the Cabral traitorous dictatorial regime, we extend our highest respect and warm congratulations to you and to the heroic Dominican people.

    "Over the past year, the Dominican people have neither been intimidated by the military occupation and armed suppression of US imperialism, nor have they been paralyzed by the enemy's political deception. They have launched an indomitable patriotic struggle against the American aggressors and their lackeys. The Dominican people's April uprising and a year of tenacious struggle have inspired the people of Latin America, Asia, Africa and all countries around the world who are fighting against imperialism headed by the United States and old and new colonialism. The revolutionary people of the world stand with you and support you.

    "The Chinese people firmly support the Dominican people's just struggle against the United States, against dictatorship, and for the freedom and liberation of their motherland. We deeply admire your revolutionary spirit of not fearing violence and not being afraid of sacrifice. The profound friendship between our two peoples forged in the struggle against our common enemy, US imperialism, is developing and consolidating day by day. We firmly believe that as long as we rely on the broad masses of the people, unite all patriotic forces, persist in a long-term struggle, and use the people's armed forces to counter the counter-revolutionary armed forces, the Dominican people will surely completely defeat US imperialism and its accomplices and win the final victory of the revolution." In February of this year, Dominican youth demonstrated in Santo Domingo, demanding that the Yankees get out. Xinhua News Agency

    美帝国主义永远平息不了多米尼加人民的反美怒火
    多米尼加首都人民盛大集会要求美军滚出去
    我和委会和亚非团结会致电支持多米尼加人民反美反独裁斗争
    新华社二十四日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都圣多明各的数千市民二十三日下午不顾大批军警的严密警戒，举行盛大的反美集会，要求美国侵略军滚回去。
    群众在集会上愤怒声讨美帝国主义武装侵略多米尼加的罪行。“美国佬滚回去”的喊声，几百次地震撼大地。
    在人群的上空，飘扬着“六月十四日革命运动”和“多米尼加人民运动”等组织的旗帜。在集会之前，这些组织还通过扩音器不断大声谴责美国佬的侵略，并且号召人民上街示威。
    这次集会是为了纪念推翻卡夫拉尔亲美独裁政权的人民武装起义一周年的。大家知道，在去年四月二十四日爆发这起惊心动魄的人民起义之后第四天，美国悍然出动军队对多米尼加实行军事占领。现在人们举行一系列纪念活动，是为了进一步动员群众，把坚持已经一年之久的反侵略斗争进行到底。
    由于害怕多米尼加人民的抗议活动，美国侵略军已经奉命不得进入圣多明各闹市区，但是美国一手扶植的“临时政府”的军警却密布圣多明各各地。警察头子洛佩斯还扬言必要时将对群众使用卡宾枪和催泪弹。这充分暴露了美国侵略者既胆怯心虚又残忍凶暴的本质。据报道，当“临时政府”的一群警察二十二日闯进圣多明各一些民房，搜查并没收一批反美传单时，愤怒的群众痛揍了其中的两名警察。
    新华社二十四日讯　中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会，今天就多米尼加人民推翻卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权的武装起义一周年，分别打电报给多米尼加六月十四日革命运动和多米尼加人民运动，重申中国人民对多米尼加人民反美、反独裁、争取祖国自由与解放的正义斗争的坚决支持。
    中国人民保卫世界和平委员会和中国亚非团结委员会的电报说：“值此多米尼加人民推翻卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权的武装起义一周年之际，谨向你们并向英勇的多米尼加人民表示崇高的敬意和热烈的祝贺。
    “一年来，多米尼加人民既没有被美帝国主义的军事占领和武装镇压所吓倒，也没有被敌人的政治欺骗所麻痹，他们不屈不挠地展开了反对美国侵略者及其走狗的爱国斗争。多米尼加人民的四月起义和一年来的顽强的斗争，鼓舞了正在为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和新老殖民主义而斗争的拉丁美洲和亚洲、非洲以及全世界各国人民。全世界革命的人民都和你们站在一起，支持你们。
    “中国人民坚定不移地支持多米尼加人民反美、反独裁、争取祖国自由与解放的正义斗争。我们非常钦佩你们不畏强暴、不怕牺牲的革命精神。我们两国人民在反对共同敌人美帝国主义战斗中所结成的深厚友谊，正在日益发展和巩固。我们深信，只要依靠广大人民群众，团结一切爱国力量，坚持长期斗争，以人民的武装来对抗反革命的武装，多米尼加人民必将彻底打败美帝国主义及其帮凶，赢得革命的最后胜利。”今年二月，多米尼加青年在圣多明各示威，要求美国佬滚回去。　　　　　　　　新华社发
