    The day before the Spring Festival this year, a commune member in his forties came to the ceramics department of the Huangpo Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Wuchuan County, Guangdong Province, wanting to buy a clay pot [bāo] lid (a type of pottery used for cooking rice). The salesperson said, "We don't sell pot lids separately here; if you want to buy one, you have to buy the pot along with it." The commune member said this several times, but the salesperson still followed the old rules and did not sell him one. The commune member then discussed it with other customers to see if anyone wanted to buy only the pot body, intending to buy a pot together with him, but was unsuccessful. Unable to do anything else, the commune member secretly left 1.5 jiao and took a pot lid behind the salesperson's back.
    A cadre from higher up who was there participating in labor discovered this incident and pondered, "In the countryside, which household doesn't have a clay pot? Pot lids get moved around a lot and are easily broken, so they often need to be replaced. The masses want to buy a pot lid separately, but the department doesn't sell them. How can this be called caring for the people's lives?" He discussed it with the political instructor, and they decided to mobilize the staff to study and solve the problem.
    The staff discussed the incident of the "lost" pot lid. Someone asked, "Does this count as stealing?" The staff believed that it did not, because the money left by the customer could buy back three pot lids. The customer's actions were, in effect, a harsh criticism of the store. Someone asked, "Why did this phenomenon occur?" Some staff members said, "We just don't sell them!" "Why don't we sell them?" "When we purchase them, it's one pot with one lid, and when we sell them, it's the pot body with the pot lid. If we sell the pot lids separately, who will want the pot body?"
    Next, everyone engaged in a heated debate about the issue of "whether or not to sell pot lids separately." Most of the staff believed that: we have studied "Serve the People," but we don't find ways to solve the pot lid problem for the masses. How can this be considered serving the people? Isn't this a manifestation of weak political viewpoints, production viewpoints, and mass viewpoints? The staff member responsible for managing clay pots argued in his defense, "It's easy to talk about, but difficult to do. If we purchase a batch of pot lids and mix them with the pot lids sold as a set, how can we distinguish them when selling? What about commodity management and financial management? If we set up another department to sell pot lids, is it cost-effective to increase the number of stores and personnel?" Some purchasing agents also believed that purchasing pot lids was piecemeal and trivial, and some salespersons thought that inspecting and inventorying pot lids was too troublesome. Someone even said, "I've lived for decades, and I've never seen pot lids sold separately."
    The leading cadres of the Huangpo Supply and Marketing Cooperative realized that, to break the convention of not selling pot lids separately, it was necessary to emphasize politics and criticize purely business viewpoints. They did not adopt an administrative order method to simply send people to organize the source of goods, but instead organized the staff to first go to the production teams to investigate and listen to the opinions and demands of the masses. In the Nan'an Production Team of the Da'an Brigade, they discovered that twenty-three households had a total of ninety-two clay pots, of which seventeen households were missing forty-two pot lids. However, to buy a pot lid, they would have to buy the pot body along with it, which would both increase the commune members' expenses and waste social wealth. The investigation in Nan'an Production Team educated the staff of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and they realized that they were wrong.
    The leading cadres of the Supply and Marketing Cooperative then organized the staff to study "Serve the People" and "Combat Liberalism." The head of the daily necessities and sundries group examined himself, saying: "In the past, I knew that not selling pot lids separately was wrong, but because I was afraid of trouble, I even forgot Chairman Mao's teachings. How can this be considered 'completely' and 'thoroughly' serving the people?" Wu Dingyou, a salesperson in the ceramics department, said: "The masses can't buy clay pot lids because I lacked the thought of wholeheartedly serving the people. I must correct this immediately." Yang Zeqing from the finance group said: "If private thoughts and selfish ideas exist, it is impossible to serve the people well. To manage pot lids, we must first defeat the 'I.'"
    After the staff's understanding was raised, they actively ordered clay pot lids from the factory and sold them in the department. When sales began, a new problem arose: the masses hoped to be able to pick the pot lids to sell at their production team, because pots came in different sizes, and pot lids also came in different sizes. Bringing pots to the market to match a lid was very inconvenient. The staff of the department accepted the masses' opinions and supplied pot lids door-to-door, which was deeply welcomed by the masses. In the month from the beginning of February, more than 1,200 pot lids were supplied door-to-door and sold in the department. The masses said: "Only cadres taught by Chairman Mao can serve us so thoughtfully."
    Through the education of this fact, the staff strengthened their socialist business ideology, and commodities that should have been retailed but were not retailed in the past are now being retailed. The ceramics department alone has increased the number of items sold retail by eighteen.

### 黄坡供销社从“丢失”一个瓦煲盖得到启示  做买卖不能只考虑自己方便  为人民服务就要同“我”字斗

    黄坡供销社从“丢失”一个瓦煲盖得到启示
    做买卖不能只考虑自己方便
    为人民服务就要同“我”字斗
    今年春节前一天，一个四十多岁的社员来到广东省吴川县黄坡供销社陶瓷门市部，要买一个瓦煲［bāo包］（一种煮饭用的陶器）盖。售货员说：“这里不零卖煲盖，要买就要连煲买回去。”这个社员说了几次，售货员还是按老规矩办事，没有卖给他。这个社员就和其他顾客商议，看有没有人只买煲身，准备跟他合伙买一个瓦煲，但是没有成功。这个社员最后没有办法，便设法背着售货员，留下一角五分钱，拿走了一个煲盖。
    上级来这里参加劳动的干部发现这件事情，心里就琢磨：“在农村，哪家哪户没有瓦煲呀？煲盖挪动多，容易打烂，常常要添置。群众要单独买一个煲盖，门市部却不卖，这怎么能说是关心群众生活呢？”他找政治指导员共同研究，决定发动职工研究解决这个问题。
    职工们讨论了“丢失”瓦煲盖的事件。有人提出：“这算不算偷东西？”职工们认为这不算偷，因为这个顾客留下的钱可以卖回三个煲盖。这个顾客这样做，实际上是对商店的一个严厉批评。有人提出：“为什么出现这种现象？”一些职工说：“咱们不卖呗！”“为什么不卖？”“进货的时候是一个煲配一个盖，销售的时候也是煲身连煲盖，如果单卖煲盖，煲身谁要呢？”
    接着，大家就“要不要零卖煲盖”问题展开热烈的争论。大多数职工认为：我们学习了《为人民服务》，却不设法替群众解决煲盖问题，这怎能算得上为人民服务呢？这不是政治观点、生产观点和群众观点薄弱的表现吗？负责经营瓦煲的职工却辩解说：“讲起来容易，做起来就难。如果购进一批煲盖，同配套出售的煲盖混在一起，卖的时候分得清吗？商品管理、财务管理，怎么办？如果另设门市部出售煲盖，增店增人合算吗？”有的采购员也认为采购煲盖零星琐碎，有的售货员认为验收盘点煲盖太麻烦。有人还说：“我活了几十年，还没有见过单独卖煲盖的。”
    黄坡供销社的领导干部意识到，要打破不零卖煲盖的惯例，就必须突出政治，批判单纯业务观点。他们没有采取行政命令的办法，简单地派人去组织货源，而是组织职工先去生产队调查，听取群众的意见和要求。在大岸大队南岸生产队，他们发现二十三户社员共有九十二个瓦煲，其中十七户缺四十二个煲盖。可是，要买一个煲盖，就得连煲身买回来，既要增加社员的开支，也浪费社会财富。南岸生产队的调查，教育了这个供销社的职工，他们认识到自己错了。
    供销社领导干部又组织职工学习《为人民服务》和《反对自由主义》。日用品和杂货组的负责人检查说：“过去明知不零卖煲盖是不对的，但是因为怕麻烦，连毛主席的教导也忘记了。这怎能算‘完全’、‘彻底’为人民服务呢？”陶瓷门市部售货员吴顶有说：“群众买不到瓦煲盖，原来是由于自己缺少全心全意为人民服务的思想，非马上改正不可。”财务组杨泽清说：“存在私心杂念，是不可能很好地为人民服务的。要经营煲盖，首先要斗倒‘我’字。”
    职工们认识提高以后，就积极向工厂订购瓦煲盖，在门市部出售。开始销售的时候，又碰到一个新问题：群众希望挑到生产队去卖，因为煲有大有小，煲盖也有大有小，带煲上墟去配一个盖，很不方便。门市部的职工接受群众的意见，挑煲盖上门供应，深受群众欢迎。从二月上旬起的一个月内，上门供应和在门市供应的瓦煲盖就有一千二百多个。群众说：“只有毛主席教导出来的干部，才能够这样周到地为我们服务。”
    通过这一事实的教育，职工们加强了社会主义经营思想，以前应该零售而没有零售的商品现在也零售了。仅陶瓷门市部增加零售的商品就有十八种。
