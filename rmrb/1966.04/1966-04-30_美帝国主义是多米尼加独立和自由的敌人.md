    The Dominican people are a people who have suffered much, having long endured the most brutal rule and suppression by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. However, the Dominican people are a heroic people, rising up time and again, resolutely striving for final victory.
    As early as the end of the last century, U.S. monopoly capital infiltrated the Dominican Republic in the form of "loans." In order to safeguard the interests of U.S. monopoly capital, the U.S. Marine Corps first occupied Santo Domingo in 1905. Later, in 1907, U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt forced the Dominican Republic to sign unequal treaties, depriving it of its sovereignty.
    In 1916, the Dominican people launched a struggle against U.S. monopoly capital, and the U.S. again sent troops to Santo Domingo for the second time, continuing its military occupation for eight years, opening the door for large-scale invasion and plunder by U.S. monopoly capital.
    By 1924, the United States had virtually completely controlled the Dominican economy. For example, almost all of Santo Domingo's sugar factories were owned by U.S. companies. Before withdrawing its occupation forces, the United States also supported a small group of large plantation owners and comprador bourgeoisie, while establishing a government and a police force that listened to Washington, supporting the reactionary military man Trujillo as its leader.
    In 1930, a new popular uprising broke out in the Dominican Republic, driving the then ruler Vásquez from power. At this time, under the direction of the United States, Trujillo came to power through a violent election farce, thus beginning thirty years of the most tyrannical rule. The Trujillo regime bloodily suppressed all resistance, but the people tirelessly persisted in their struggle.
    On June 14, 1959, a group of patriots landed on the beaches of Maimón and Estero Hondo and entered the mountains, establishing bases and launching armed struggles. Although this struggle failed, under its influence, the "June 14 Revolutionary Movement" was secretly established, later developing into an active and organized patriotic force.
    After Trujillo's assassination in 1961, the people's movement experienced new development. In order to prevent a Dominican people's revolution, U.S. imperialism repeatedly sent fleets to the Dominican coast to threaten the country, and supported new puppets to carry out new suppression. However, the tide of the people's struggle continued to rise, and under this situation, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs had to agree to hold elections to ease the people's anti-American sentiment.
    Juan Bosch, who was elected president in the elections held in December 1962, took office in February of the following year. Under strong pressure from the people, the Bosch government proposed a constitution that made certain concessions to the people's national democratic demands. This immediately aroused new interference from U.S. imperialism. In September 1963, Washington, through the Dominican reactionary military leader Wessin and the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency agent Imbert, launched a military coup, drove Bosch away, abolished the constitution, and re-implemented military dictatorship.
    The Dominican people answered this reactionary military coup by strengthening unity and struggle. In November 1963, the "June 14 Revolutionary Movement" launched an armed uprising, opening up six guerrilla fronts across the country. However, this armed struggle was also brutally suppressed because it did not extensively mobilize the masses to participate in the struggle.
    On April 24, 1965, a group of patriotic young military officers launched a coup against the military dictatorship. When the balance of power showed a disparity, the coup leaders began to distribute weapons to the masses, relying on them to resist the army of the reactionary regime, which possessed superior equipment. The people, who had gained weapons, fought bravely, repelling the reactionary army's offensive, capturing the National Palace, a stronghold of reactionary forces, using the captured weapons to expand their own armed forces, and fighting heroically.
    It was at this time that the Johnson government brazenly dispatched more than 30,000 troops to carry out open armed intervention, and then played political deception conspiracies, colluding with some of the officers and rightists who participated in the uprising to achieve a compromise, imposing a so-called "Reconciliation Act" and a "Provisional Government" on the Dominican people, causing a temporary setback to the Dominican people's struggle. However, the heroic Dominican people were neither intimidated by the U.S. invading army that was densely deployed across the country nor paralyzed by the enemy's deceitful conspiracies. They did not lay down their weapons, but instead transformed the constitutionalist struggle against military dictatorship into a national liberation struggle directly against the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs. In the struggle, they have more clearly recognized the enemy, and have had better organization and a clearer program of action, have had richer experience in struggle, and have mastered a considerable number of weapons. They will be able to fight better than ever before.
    The developments of the past year show that a country's people, widely united, tightly holding weapons, and persisting in struggle, cannot be defeated by any reactionary force. Now, the Dominican people have inflicted a heavy blow on U.S. imperialism politically and continue to wage a heroic struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their running dogs. With the support of the people of the world, the Dominican people's anti-U.S. patriotic struggle will surely achieve final victory. (End)

### 美帝国主义是多米尼加独立和自由的敌人

    美帝国主义是多米尼加独立和自由的敌人
    多米尼加人民是多难的人民，长期以来遭受了美帝国主义及其走狗的最残暴的统治和镇压。但是，多米尼加人民是英勇的人民，他们一次又一次地奋起反抗，坚决争取最后的胜利。
    早在上世纪的末期，美国垄断资本就以“贷款”的形式侵入多米尼加。为了维护美国垄断资本利益，美国海军陆战队在一九○五年第一次占领圣多明各。后来，一九○七年，美国总统老罗斯福又强迫多米尼加签订不平等条约，剥夺多米尼加的主权。
    一九一六年，多米尼加人民掀起反对美国垄断资本的斗争，美国又第二次出兵圣多明各，并继续军事占领达八年之久，为美国垄断资本的大规模入侵和掠夺敞开大门。
    到一九二四年时，美国实际上完全控制了多米尼加的经济。例如圣多明各的糖厂已差不多全部属于美国公司所有。美国在撤出占领军之前，还扶植了一小撮大庄园主和买办资产阶级，同时建立了一个听命于华盛顿的政府和一支警察部队，扶植了反动军人特鲁希略为其头目。
    一九三○年，多米尼加发生了新的人民起义，把当时的统治者瓦斯克斯赶下了台。这时候，特鲁希略就在美国指使下，通过一场使用暴力的选举丑剧上台执政，从此开始了三十年的最暴虐的统治。特鲁希略政权血腥地镇压了一切反抗，但人民仍然不倦地坚持斗争。
    一九五九年六月十四日，一批爱国者在曼蒙和文斯戴罗—洪多海滩登陆，并进入山区，建立根据地，开展了武装斗争。这次斗争虽然失败了，但在它的影响下，“六月十四日革命运动”秘密成立了，后来发展成为一支活跃的有组织的爱国力量。
    在一九六一年特鲁希略遭到暗杀之后，人民运动有了新的发展。美帝国主义为了防止多米尼加人民革命，曾多次出动舰队到多米尼加沿海进行威胁，并扶植新的傀儡，进行新的镇压。但是，人民斗争的浪潮继续高涨，在这种形势下，美帝国主义及其走狗不得不同意举行选举，来缓和人民的反美情绪。
    在一九六二年十二月举行的选举中当选总统的胡安·博什，于次年二月上台。在人民的强大压力下，博什政府提出了一项对人民的民族民主要求作出一定让步的宪法。这立即引起了美帝国主义新的干涉。一九六三年九月，华盛顿通过多米尼加的反动军事头子维辛和美国中央情报局的特务因贝尔特发动军事政变，赶走了博什，废除了宪法，重新实行军事独裁。
    多米尼加人民以加强团结和战斗来回答这次反动军事政变。一九六三年十一月，“六月十四日革命运动”发动武装起义，在全国开辟了六条游击战线。然而这次武装斗争也因为没有广泛发动群众参加斗争而被残酷地镇压下去。
    一九六五年四月二十四日，一批爱国青年军人发动了反对军事独裁的政变。在力量对比显出悬殊的时候，政变者开始把武器散发给人民群众，依靠他们来对抗拥有优势装备的反动政权的军队。掌握了武器的人民英勇作战，击退反动军队的进攻，攻占了反动势力的堡垒国民宫，用缴获的武器扩大武装自己，英勇斗争。
    正是在这个时候，约翰逊政府悍然出动三万多军队，进行公开的武装干涉，接着又玩弄政治诱骗阴谋，拉拢部分参加起义的军官和右派搞妥协，把一项所谓“和解法”和一个“临时政府”强加在多米尼加人民头上，使多米尼加人民的斗争遭到了暂时的挫折。但是，英雄的多米尼加人民既没有被密布在国土上的美国侵略军所吓倒，也没有为敌人的欺骗阴谋所麻痹。他们没有放下武器，而是把反对军事独裁的护宪斗争变成了直接反对美国侵略者及其走狗的民族解放斗争。在斗争中，他们已经更清楚地认清了敌人，并且有了更好的组织和更明确的行动纲领，有了更丰富的斗争经验，掌握了相当数量的武器，他们将能够比以往更好地战斗。
    一年来的事态发展表明，一个国家的人民广泛团结起来，紧握武器，坚持斗争，是任何反动力量所不能战胜的。现在，多米尼加人民已经使美帝国主义在政治上遭到沉重打击，并且继续同美国侵略者及其走狗进行英勇的斗争。在全世界人民的支持下，多米尼加人民的反美爱国斗争是一定能够取得最后胜利的。（末）
