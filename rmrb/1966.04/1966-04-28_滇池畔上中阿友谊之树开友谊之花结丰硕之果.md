    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, April 26th: The Albanian olive trees, symbols of the friendship between the Chinese and Albanian people, planted in the Haikou Forest Farm on the shores of Kunming’s Dianchi Lake, are generally growing well. The average height of all saplings has reached 190 centimeters, with some reaching as high as 340 centimeters. In this early summer season, these olive trees are full of flowers, and some have already borne tender green fruits.
    These trees of friendship were presented to the Chinese government by Albanian Chairman of the Council of Ministers Shehu on behalf of the Albanian government during Premier Zhou Enlai's visit to Albania in the spring of 1964. In February of that year, Ilia Nako, chief engineer of the Forestry Bureau of the Albanian Ministry of Agriculture, and olive planting expert Betri Romani, escorted ten thousand olive saplings to China. More than two thousand of these saplings were planted in the Haikou Forest Farm in Kunming. At that time, Premier Zhou Enlai, who had just returned from a foreign visit, personally planted an olive tree in the forest farm together with the two Albanian experts.
    The staff of the Haikou Forest Farm attach great importance to the cultivation of these olive trees. They have assigned special personnel to manage these saplings. For the past two years, cadres, workers, commune members, and horticultural experts in Kunming have been concerned about the growth of these saplings. Workers from factories near Haikou also use their holidays to participate in voluntary labor in the forest farm; commune members have accumulated large amounts of farmyard manure to fertilize these saplings. On the day the reporter visited the forest farm, hundreds of young workers used their holidays to water and fertilize these "trees of friendship." One technician told the reporter: "The Albanian people are strong Marxist-Leninist fighters standing on the front line against imperialism and modern revisionism. The people of China and Albania are brothers linked by flesh and blood. We must carefully cultivate these precious young trees so that they, like Sino-Albanian friendship, are deeply rooted, leafy, and evergreen!" In the two years that these saplings have taken root in Haikou, they have demonstrated their strong vitality. In the first year of olive planting, there were insect pests, and during the rainy season, some saplings developed canker disease. However, thanks to the careful management of the staff, the olive saplings have finally grown strong.
    Olive trees have high economic value. The pulp of its fruit contains 60 to 75 percent oil, making it the second most important woody oil crop among subtropical oil crops in the world, second only to oil palm. According to relevant experts, the flowering and fruiting of the Albanian olive trees in Haikou fully confirms that the Kunming area is suitable for the growth of olive trees. The staff of the forest farm has also conducted scientific experiments on cuttings and grafting, with good results. The staff is determined to make this olive tree grow in large quantities on Chinese soil.

### 滇池畔上中阿友谊之树开友谊之花结丰硕之果

    滇池畔上中阿友谊之树开友谊之花结丰硕之果
    新华社昆明二十六日电　种植在昆明滇池畔海口林场里的中阿两国人民的友谊之树——阿尔巴尼亚油橄榄，普遍生长良好，全部树苗平均生长高度达一百九十厘米，有的高达三百四十厘米。在这初夏时节里，这些油橄榄繁花满树，有的已经结出嫩绿的果实。
    这些友谊之树是周恩来总理一九六四年春访问阿尔巴尼亚时，由阿尔巴尼亚部长会议谢胡主席代表阿尔巴尼亚政府赠送给我国政府的。当年二月，阿尔巴尼亚农业部林业局总工程师伊利亚·纳科和油橄榄种植专家贝特里·罗曼尼专程将一万枝油橄榄树苗护送到中国，其中有二千多枝树苗种在昆明海口林场。当时，刚从国外访问归来的周恩来总理曾和两位阿尔巴尼亚专家一起，亲手把一枝油橄榄种植在林场里。
    海口林场职工十分重视这些油橄榄树的培育工作。他们指定专人来管理这些树苗。两年来，昆明市的机关干部、工人、公社社员和园艺专家，都关心着这些树苗的生长情况。海口附近工厂的工人，还利用假日来林场参加义务劳动；公社社员积了大批农家肥送来为这些树苗施肥。记者访问林场的当天，就有数百名青年工人利用假日来这里为这些“友谊之树”浇水施肥。一位技术工人对记者说：“阿尔巴尼亚人民是站在反对帝国主义、反对现代修正主义前线的坚强的马克思列宁主义的战士。中阿两国人民是血肉相联的兄弟，我们要精心培植这些珍贵的幼树，使它象中阿友谊那样根深叶茂，万代常青！”这些树苗在海口落户的两年中，显示了它旺盛的生命力。油橄榄种植的第一年曾遭虫害，雨季里一些树苗又出现溃疡病。但是经过职工们的精心管理，油橄榄树苗终于茁壮地成长起来。
    油橄榄有很高的经济价值。它的果肉含油量达百分之六十至七十五，是世界亚热带油料作物中仅次于油棕的一种主要木本油料。据有关专家介绍，阿尔巴尼亚赠送给我国的油橄榄在海口开花结果，充分证实昆明地区适宜于油橄榄树的生长。林场职工还作了插条和扦插的科学试验，效果也很好。职工们决心使这种油橄榄能在中国的土地上大量生长。
