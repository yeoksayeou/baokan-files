    Supporting the Solemn Position of the Kingdom of Cambodia
    By a Commentator of This Newspaper
    Instigated by U.S. imperialism, its Saigon lackeys are constantly carrying out blatant aggression against Cambodia. On April 15th and 18th, the U.S.-South Vietnamese puppet troops repeatedly invaded Cambodian territory, killing and wounding many Cambodian soldiers and civilians. The Royal Government of Cambodia issued a statement on the 23rd, strongly protesting the bloody atrocities committed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, demanding that the U.S.-Saigon puppet clique bear full responsibility for this. The Chinese people are indignantly condemning the new crimes committed by U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese running dogs against Cambodia, and resolutely support the solemn position of the Cambodian government and people in safeguarding independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.
    Washington has repeatedly directed the South Vietnamese puppet clique to carry out military provocations against Cambodia, and sometimes even personally steps in, with the participation of U.S. invading troops in harassment activities. What exactly is the purpose of this? As everyone knows, this is nothing more than an attempt to force the Kingdom of Cambodia to abandon its policy of peace and neutrality. In other words, it is to make Cambodia tolerate the heinous war of aggression waged by U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people, and to make Cambodia tolerate U.S. imperialism doing whatever it wants in Indochina. However, the Cambodian people deeply understand that in the face of the serious situation of U.S. imperialism intensifying and expanding the flames of war, the fate of the Indochinese people is shared. As His Royal Highness Prince Sihanouk, Head of State of Cambodia, recently said: "We Cambodians have also suffered from the gradual escalation of aggression and war launched by our common enemy."
    The Cambodian people are a people with ambition and national pride. The Cambodian people are a people who are not afraid of violence and dare to fight. They have resolutely fought back against the aggression and provocations of U.S. imperialism and its South Vietnamese running dogs. The Johnson government's rude pressure on the Kingdom of Cambodia, which loves peace and adheres to a policy of neutrality, can only have one result, and that is to further expose the ugly face of U.S. imperialism in front of the people of the world.
    The Cambodian people's struggle against the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs is by no means isolated. All peace-loving people of the world sympathize with and support the resolute measures and solemn position taken by the Royal Government and people of Cambodia to safeguard national sovereignty. The 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Cambodian people and fully support the Cambodian people's just struggle to resist the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs.

    支持柬埔寨王国的严正立场	本报评论员
    美帝国主义唆使它的西贡走狗，不断地对柬埔寨进行明目张胆的侵略。四月十五日和十八日，美国—南越伪军又一再侵入柬埔寨国境，打死、打伤许多柬埔寨军民。柬埔寨王国政府二十三日发表声明，强烈抗议美帝国主义及其走狗的血腥暴行，要求美国—西贡傀儡集团对此担负全部责任。中国人民愤怒谴责美帝国主义及其南越走狗对柬埔寨犯下的新的罪行，并坚决支持柬埔寨政府和人民维护独立、主权和领土完整的严正立场。
    华盛顿一而再、再而三地指使南越傀儡集团对柬埔寨进行军事挑衅，有时甚至亲自出马，由美国侵略军参与骚扰活动，究竟是为了什么呢？人所共知，这无非是想迫使柬埔寨王国放弃和平中立政策。换句话说，就是要柬埔寨容忍美帝国主义对越南人民进行罪恶的侵略战争，容忍美帝国主义在印度支那为所欲为。但是，柬埔寨人民深深懂得，在美帝国主义加紧扩大战火的严重情况面前，印度支那人民的命运是共同的。正如柬埔寨王国国家元首西哈努克亲王最近所说的：“我们柬埔寨也受到了我们的共同敌人所发动的侵略和战争的逐步升级之害。”
    柬埔寨人民是有志气的、有民族自豪感的人民。柬埔寨人民是不畏强暴、敢于斗争的人民。他们对于美帝国主义及其南越走狗的侵略和挑衅，给予了坚决的还击。约翰逊政府对爱好和平和坚持中立政策的柬埔寨王国粗暴地施加压力，只能得到一个结果，这就是在全世界人民的面前进一步暴露美帝国主义的丑恶面目。
    柬埔寨人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗侵略和干涉的斗争，绝不是孤立的。全世界一切爱好和平的人民，都同情和支持柬埔寨王国政府和人民为维护国家主权所采取的坚决措施和严正立场。六亿五千万中国人民将始终同柬埔寨人民站在一起，全力支援柬埔寨人民抵抗美帝国主义及其走狗侵略和干涉的正义斗争。
