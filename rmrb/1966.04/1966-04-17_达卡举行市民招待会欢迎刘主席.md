    Dacca Municipal Committee Chairman Mainuddin Chowdhury said that for the benefit of both countries, for the sake of Asian-African solidarity and world peace, the relations between the two countries will grow with each passing day.
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said that China will continue to support the Pakistani people's struggle to safeguard national independence, national sovereignty and unity. It is China's honor that U.S. imperialism regards China, which resolutely supports the revolutionary struggles of people of all countries against imperialism, as its main enemy. The perverse acts of imperialism make the people of Asian and African countries more aware of who are their enemies and who are their friends.
    Xinhua News Agency, Dacca, 15th – A civic reception attended by 7,000 people was held here this afternoon on the East Pakistan Governor's House lawn to welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi.
    Chairman Liu Shaoqi and President Ayub Khan attended the reception. When Chairman Liu and his wife, President Ayub Khan, Vice Premier Chen Yi and his wife, accompanied by East Pakistan Governor Abdul Monem Khan, Foreign Minister Bhutto and his wife, entered the Governor's House and walked onto the platform on the red carpet, everyone present stood up to welcome them with enthusiastic applause. Girls in national costumes danced national dances to the sound of hand drums and sprinkled flower petals on the Chinese guests.
    Dacca Municipal Committee Chairman Mainuddin Chowdhury delivered a speech at the reception on behalf of the citizens of Dacca, extending the warmest welcome to Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Vice Premier Chen Yi and other Chinese guests visiting East Pakistan.
    He said that the remarkable progress made by the People's Republic of China in a short period of time "is a miracle in modern history." He said, "Pakistan is delighted at the happiness and prosperity enjoyed by the Chinese people today due to their amazing epoch-making economic development."
    He said: "Mutual visits at all levels between the two countries are invaluable in bringing the people of the two countries closer together."
    Mainuddin Chowdhury pointed out: "Our West Pakistani brothers have already expressed their deep gratitude to the Chinese people and government for their support to Pakistan in resisting aggression. The people of East Pakistan, together with their compatriots, praise the attitude of the Chinese people and government in upholding our just cause. In the days of the heroic struggle against the aggressors, you did not hesitate to express sympathy and support, which the Pakistani people will never forget. The Pakistani people also highly value the support of the 650 million Chinese people for the right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir."
    He concluded: "We wish the People's Republic of China new achievements in its commitment to peace. We firmly believe that for the benefit of both countries, for the sake of Asian-African solidarity and world peace, the relations between the two countries will grow with each passing day."
    Next, Vice Premier Chen Yi delivered a speech (full text on page 3). He said: "China and Pakistan are friendly neighbors. The people of our two countries have always sympathized with and supported each other in the struggle for and safeguarding national independence, and have forged a profound friendship."
    He said: "The Chinese people have always supported the people of the world in opposing oppression and aggression. Our support for your struggle against aggression is only fulfilling our due obligations. Moreover, in our view, support has always been mutual. Your struggle against aggression not only safeguarded Pakistan's sovereignty and dignity, but also made an important contribution to safeguarding peace in this region. This is a strong support for the Chinese people. If thanks are needed, then we should first thank you."
    He emphasized: "In the future, whether it is East Pakistan or West Pakistan, if it is once again subjected to armed attack by aggressors, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will continue to support the Pakistani people's struggle to safeguard national independence, national sovereignty and unity. As long as the people of Kashmir are still subjected to cruel oppression and cannot obtain freedom, the Chinese government and the Chinese people will continue to support the Kashmiri people's struggle for the right to self-determination. No matter how others curse and slander us, our position will never change."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi said, "The struggle of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America to win and safeguard national independence is an irresistible historical trend. No matter how imperialism and old and new colonialism stir up countercurrents, they cannot stop it. Their aggressive positions all over the world are like volcanoes, erupting at any time."
    He pointed out, "In order to save their fate of defeat, imperialism and old and new colonialism are carrying out frantic counterattacks." He said, "The U.S. government has officially announced that its global strategic center has shifted to the Far East. It regards China, which resolutely supports the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries, as its main enemy. On the one hand, it is expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, and on the other hand, it is planning to establish an encirclement around China. Its military provocations and threats of war against China are becoming more and more blatant. China loves peace. However, if U.S. imperialism insists on imposing war on us, we are determined to resist to the end at any cost and make our own contribution to defeating imperialism and defending world peace."
    He said, "The United States is indeed actively preparing to attack China. But in order to achieve this goal, it must first control the countries and regions around China. The United States is precisely forcing these countries to abandon their independent and autonomous policies and submit to the strategic needs of the United States under the banner of 'anti-China'. If they are not controlled by it, and do not listen to its command, it will engage in subversion and sabotage."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out, "The people of Asia and Africa cannot be deceived, and China cannot be isolated. It is China's honor that imperialism regards China as its main enemy. This proves that China's resolute support for the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries is not just empty talk, but is being put into practice. The perverse acts of imperialism make the people of Asian and African countries more aware of who are their enemies and who are their friends. Let the people of Asian and African countries further unite and carry the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism to the end."
    Vice Premier Chen Yi's speech was repeatedly interrupted by warm applause.
    After the speech, the Municipal Committee and the Chinese guests exchanged gifts.
    Shortly before the start of the reception, a sudden rain shower slightly lowered the scorching tropical temperature. The roads from Chairman Liu's residence in the Presidential Palace to the Governor's House were lined with people, and the Governor's House was also crowded with people. They were jubilant and shouted in Chinese: "Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!" "Long live China-Pakistan friendship!" After the reception, the main streets and all buildings in Dacca were lit up with colorful electric lights, dazzlingly bright.
    Attending the reception were Pakistani government Minister of Communications Abdul Sabur Khan, Minister of Industry and Natural Resources Altaf Hussain, Minister of Works, Food and Agriculture Shams-ud Doha, Speaker of the East Pakistan Provincial Assembly Abdul Hamid Chowdhury, all ministers of the provincial government, members of the National Assembly, members of the Provincial Assembly, other senior military and government officials, and prominent figures from all walks of life.
    Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhang Hanfu and other personnel accompanying Chairman Liu Shaoqi on his visit attended the reception.
    Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Ding Guoyu and Pakistani Ambassador to China Rochar also attended the reception.
    Also attending the reception were Chinese Consul General in Dacca Wang Ze and diplomatic personnel from various consulates in Dacca. (Attached picture)

    达卡举行市民招待会欢迎刘主席
    达卡市政委员会主席迈努丁·乔杜里说，为了两国的利益，为了亚非团结和世界和平的利益，两国关系将与日俱增。
    陈毅副总理说，中国将继续支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、维护国家主权和统一的斗争。美帝国主义把坚决支持各国人民反帝革命斗争的中国看成是主要的敌人，这是中国的光荣。帝国主义的倒行逆施，使亚非各国人民更加认清，谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。
    新华社达卡十五日电　十五日下午在这里的东巴基斯坦省督府大草坪上举行了有七千人参加的市民招待会，欢迎刘少奇主席。
    刘少奇主席和阿尤布·汗总统出席了招待会。当刘主席和夫人、阿尤布·汗总统、陈毅副总理和夫人，在东巴基斯坦省督阿卜杜勒·穆奈姆·汗、外交部长布托和夫人的陪同下进入省督府，踏着红地毯走上主席台的时候，所有到会的人都起立欢迎，热烈鼓掌。穿着民族服装的姑娘在手鼓声中跳起了民族舞，并向中国客人身上撒花瓣。
    达卡市政委员会主席迈努丁·乔杜里代表达卡市民在招待会上发表讲话，对刘少奇主席、陈毅副总理以及其他中国客人访问东巴基斯坦表示最热烈的欢迎。
    他说，中华人民共和国在短短的时间内取得的显著进步“是现代史上的一个奇迹”。他说：“巴基斯坦对于中国人民由于他们的惊人的划时代的经济发展而在今天所享有的幸福和繁荣感到欢欣鼓舞。”
    他说：“两国之间各级的互访在使两国人民的关系更为密切方面，是十分宝贵的。”
    迈努丁·乔杜里指出：“我们的西巴基斯坦兄弟已经对中国人民和政府对巴基斯坦抵抗侵略的支持表示过深深的感谢。东巴基斯坦人民同他们的同胞一起，赞扬中国人民和政府维护我们的正义事业的态度。在反对侵略者的英勇斗争的日子里，你们毫不犹豫地表示同情和支持，巴基斯坦人民将永远不会忘记。巴基斯坦人民还十分重视六亿五千万中国人民对查谟和克什米尔人民的自决权的支持。”
    他最后说：“我们祝中华人民共和国在致力于和平方面取得新的成就。我们坚信，为了两国的利益，为了亚非团结和世界和平的利益，两国的关系将与日俱增。”
    接着，陈毅副总理讲了话（全文见第三版）。他说：“中国和巴基斯坦是友好的近邻。我们两国人民在争取和维护民族独立的斗争中，一向互相同情，互相支持，结成了深厚的友谊。”
    他说：“中国人民一贯支持世界人民反对压迫和侵略。我们支持你们反侵略的斗争，不过是尽了自己应尽的义务。而且在我们看来，支持从来是相互的。你们的反侵略斗争不仅维护了巴基斯坦的主权和尊严，而且对保卫这个地区的和平也做出了重要的贡献。这就是对中国人民的有力支持。如果需要感谢的话，那末我们应当首先感谢你们。”
    他强调指出：“今后，不论是东巴基斯坦，或者是西巴基斯坦，如果再一次遭到侵略者的武装进攻，中国政府和中国人民将继续支持巴基斯坦人民维护民族独立、维护国家主权和统一的斗争。只要克什米尔人民还受到残酷的压迫，得不到自由，中国政府和中国人民将继续支持克什米尔人民争取自决权利的斗争。不管别人怎样咒骂和诬蔑，我们这个立场是决不会改变的。”
    陈毅副总理说，“亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民争取和维护民族独立的斗争，是一股历史洪流。帝国主义和新老殖民主义不管怎样掀起逆流，也阻挡不住。他们在世界各地的侵略阵地，象一座一座的火山，随时都在爆发。”
    他指出，“为了挽救失败的命运，帝国主义和新老殖民主义正在进行疯狂的反扑。”他说，“美国政府正式宣布，它的全球战略中心已经转移到远东。它把坚决支持各国人民反帝革命斗争的中国，看成是主要的敌人。它一方面扩大侵略越南的战争，另一方面在中国周围策划建立一个包围圈。它对中国的军事挑衅和战争威胁越来越露骨。中国是热爱和平的。但是，如果美帝国主义硬要把战争强加在我们头上，我们决心不惜任何代价，抵抗到底，为打败帝国主义、保卫世界和平作出自己的贡献。”
    他说，“美国确实是在积极准备进攻中国。但是，为了达到这个目的，它首先要把中国周围的国家和地区控制起来。美国正是打着‘反华’的旗号，强迫这些国家放弃独立自主的政策，屈从美国的战略需要。如果不受它的控制，不听它的指挥，它就搞颠覆破坏。”
    陈毅副总理指出，“亚非人民是欺骗不了的，中国是孤立不了的。帝国主义把中国看成是主要的敌人，这是中国的光荣。这证明，中国坚决支援各国人民的反帝革命斗争，不是说说空话，而是说到做到。帝国主义的倒行逆施，使亚非各国人民更加认清，谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。让我们亚非各国人民进一步团结起来，把反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争进行到底。”
    陈毅副总理的讲话一再为热烈的掌声所打断。
    讲话后，市政委员会和中国客人互赠了礼物。
    在招待会开始前不久，一场突然的阵雨使热带的灼热气温稍稍下降。从刘主席下榻的总统府到省督府的道路两旁，站满了人，省督府里也挤满了人。他们喜气洋洋，用中国话高呼：“毛泽东主席万岁！”“中巴友好万岁！”招待会结束后，达卡市的主要街道和所有建筑物上的彩色电灯全部开放，耀眼夺目。
    出席招待会的有巴基斯坦政府交通部长阿卜杜勒·萨布尔·汗，工业和自然资源部长阿塔弗·侯赛因，工程、粮食和农业部长沙姆索多哈，东巴基斯坦省议会议长阿卜杜勒·哈米德·乔杜里，省政府全体部长，国民议会议员，省议会议员，其他高级军政官员和各界知名人士。
    中国外交部副部长章汉夫和陪同刘少奇主席访问的其他随行人员出席了招待会。
    中国驻巴基斯坦大使丁国钰和巴基斯坦驻中国大使罗查也出席了招待会。
    出席招待会的还有中国驻达卡总领事王泽和各国驻达卡领事馆的外交人员。（附图片）
