    One day, Company Commander Qin sent seven soldiers to cut grass. When the soldiers arrived at the area designated by the company commander, the grass there had already been cut by others, so the soldiers had to go to a more distant place to cut. According to the company commander's instructions, each person was to carry one load, and whoever finished could return. Unexpectedly, at the beginning, one soldier accidentally cut his hand, and everyone advised him to go back early. The remaining six comrades discussed and decided to still cut seven loads. They said that in battle, the combat mission should not be reduced just because one person is injured and taken off the front line. In peacetime, when carrying out tasks, we must also adhere to the spirit and standards of wartime. They helped each other, cut seven loads of grass, and took turns carrying them back. When Company Commander Qin learned about this, he deeply felt that our soldiers were truly good, and at the same time, he felt that he had not given prominence to politics: his task assignment lacked investigation and research, and his guiding ideology lacked collectivism. At the evening roll call, he praised the soldiers and criticized himself.
    The *Liberation Army Daily* published a commentary in the "One Thing, One Discussion" column saying: The soldiers have merits, of course, which are inseparable from the help and education of the cadres. However, sometimes the soldiers' merits precisely reflect the cadres' shortcomings. These soldiers are good because: they did not mechanically execute the company commander's orders, but took the initiative to go to a more distant place to cut grass in order to complete the task; they did not accept the incorrect arrangement of "whoever finishes cutting can go back," but were united and friendly, and worked together, with six people cutting the grass of seven people. They took the initiative to make up for what the cadres had not thought enough about; they corrected what the cadres had said incorrectly with their actions. They acted in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions.
    Don't think that once you become a cadre, whatever you say or do is right, and the soldiers are certainly not as good as you in everything. "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often naive and ridiculous." Only when we truly understand this can we humbly learn from the masses, and only then can we handle problems realistically and reasonably.

    谁对，就向谁学习
    一天，覃连长派七个战士去割草。战士们到了连长指定的地区，那里的草被别人割完了，战士们只好到更远的地方去割。按照连长的意见，每人一担，谁割够了就回去。没有料到，一开始，有个战士不慎割伤了手，大家劝他提前回去。其余六个同志商量，还是割七担。他们说，打仗不能因为一人负伤下火线，就减少战斗任务，平时执行任务也要坚持战时的精神和标准。他们互相帮助，割满了七担草，轮番接转地挑回来。覃连长知道了这件事，深感我们的战士真是好，同时感到自己没有突出政治：布置任务缺乏调查研究，指导思想缺乏集体主义。晚点名的时候，他表扬了战士，批评了自己。
    《解放军报》在《一事一议》栏发表评论说：战士有了优点，当然是和干部的帮助教育分不开的。然而，有些时候，战士的优点，却正好反映出干部的缺点。这几个战士好就好在：他们没有机械地执行连长的命令，而是为了完成任务，主动地到更远的地方去割草；他们没有接受“谁割够了就回去”的不正确的安排，而是团结友爱，同心协力，六个人割了七个人的草。干部想得不够的地方，他们主动地弥补了；干部讲得不对的地方，他们用行动纠正了。他们是按毛主席指示办事的。
    不要以为，做了干部，就不论说什么、做什么，都是对的，战士就一定事事不如自己。“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的。”真正明白了这一点，才能虚心向群众学习，处理问题才能做到实事求是、合情合理。
