    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 10th: The Vietnamese magazine "Study" published an article in its April issue, strongly condemning the brutal crimes of the Indonesian reactionary clique, instigated by U.S. imperialism, in plotting a coup and carrying out a bloody massacre of Indonesian communists and the Indonesian people. The article expresses that the Vietnamese people firmly support the struggle of the Indonesian people and believe that the Indonesian people, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, will surely achieve the final victory of the revolution.

    The article states that world progressive public opinion is strongly condemning the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique for persecuting and killing Indonesian communists and patriotic progressive figures. The Vietnamese people, together with the progressive people of the world, resolutely oppose the white terror of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique and resolutely refute the conspiracies they fabricate to slander the Indonesian Communist Party and Indonesian democratic and progressive organizations and to justify their heinous counter-revolutionary crimes. No matter what tricks the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique plays, they cannot reverse black and white or obliterate the facts. The events that have occurred continuously in Indonesia in recent months prove that they are the elements that bring disaster to the country and the people, plotting to overthrow the Indonesian government and President Sukarno, and establish a military dictatorship in Indonesia that serves as a running dog of the United States, destroying the revolutionary achievements of the Indonesian people. They and their master, U.S. imperialism, are the criminals who must be brought to justice.

    The article condemns U.S. imperialism for grossly interfering in Indonesia's internal affairs and for instigating and supporting the Indonesian reactionaries in plotting a coup to overthrow the Indonesian government and President Sukarno. The article points out that through the propaganda rhetoric of U.S. imperialism and the activities of the U.S. Embassy in Indonesia, it is clear that behind the Indonesian reactionary clique is the bloody claw of U.S. imperialism pulling the strings. U.S. imperialism has clearly exposed itself as the mastermind and culprit behind the current chaotic situation in Indonesia, and as the irreconcilable enemy of the Indonesian revolution and people.

    The article says that this is not surprising, because U.S. imperialism has long been using various means to try to turn Indonesia, a country with a large population, abundant resources, and an important strategic position in Southeast Asia in many respects, into its new type of colony and military base.

    The article states that in the past, the Indonesian government had announced many specific and conclusive evidence of U.S. imperialism's gross interference in Indonesia's internal affairs. The conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to help and instigate the pro-American reactionary clique to gather in the so-called "Generals' Council" to plot a coup to overthrow the legitimate Indonesian government has been fully exposed.

    The article says that Lieutenant Colonel Untung and other patriotic officers bravely rose up to defend the legitimate Indonesian government and oppose the coup conspiracy of the pro-American reactionary clique. Although the righteous actions of Lieutenant Colonel Untung and his friends were not successful, they contributed to exposing the unspeakable conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs in Indonesia.

    The article says that the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique's slander against the Indonesian Communist Party and its extremely barbarous persecution of Indonesian communists and patriotic progressive figures completely exposed their counter-revolutionary faces. According to many Indonesian sources, since the beginning of October 1965, more than 250,000 people have been killed by them, and tens of thousands have been imprisoned and abused.

    The article points out that the Indonesian revolution is facing a severe test, but the final victory will surely belong to the Indonesian people. The historical experience of the Indonesian revolution and the revolutions of other countries in the world shows that the road of revolution is not smooth. The general and long-term law of revolution is to continuously move forward, but due to various objective and subjective reasons, especially the enemy's cunning conspiracies and frantic confrontation, the revolution may temporarily stagnate or regress at a certain time and in a certain place. Therefore, the history of revolution has always been one of overcoming difficulties and striving for victory through constant struggle. Revolutionaries must at all times be mentally and physically prepared to overcome all kinds of difficulties, and each time they overcome difficulties, they will achieve new victories, and the final victory will come sooner.

    The article says that the historical experience of the Indonesian revolution shows that no matter how barbarous and frantic the current persecution actions of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique are, they cannot extinguish the revolutionary flame of the Indonesian people who have a strong tradition of unyielding struggle. During the rule of the Dutch colonialists and the Japanese fascist group, the Indonesian people constantly rose up to resist the invaders. Since achieving national independence, the Indonesian people have continuously struggled against foreign imperialism, especially the interference and sabotage of U.S. imperialism. The Indonesian Communist Party has experienced a long period of heroic and arduous struggle. For more than forty-five years, the Indonesian Communist Party has suffered large-scale persecution twice and has been forced to operate in extremely difficult secret conditions for a long time, but the strength of the party has continued to develop. The Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique attempts to use blood and fire to eliminate the Indonesian Communist Party and democratic progressive forces. Their conspiracy is bound to fail. Under the leadership of the heroic Indonesian Communist Party, the strong and unyielding Indonesian people will rise up to cut off the bloody claws of the reactionary clique, not allowing them to continue to run rampant and sabotage the revolution. The Indonesian Communist Party, tempered in the furnace of revolutionary struggle, will overcome the current severe test, consolidate and develop its strength, so as to continue to guide the revolutionary cause of Indonesia forward. The article says that the current era is the era of socialist revolution and national liberation revolution. Revolutionary storms are rising more and more vigorously in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Imperialism, headed by U.S. imperialism, is suffering continuous attacks everywhere, including in the United States. In Southeast Asia alone, U.S. imperialism is suffering many heavy defeats and is deeply mired in quagmire in Vietnam and Laos, etc. The counter-revolutionary actions of U.S. imperialism and the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique do not show that they are strong. From a global perspective, this is only a partial counterattack in the entire situation where U.S. imperialism has been subjected to attacks and defeats for a long time. From the Indonesian scope, this is just a temporary counterattack of the counter-revolutionary forces after decades of being overwhelmed and defeated by the people's revolutionary forces. The extremely blatant actions of the pro-American reactionary clique to harm the country and the people make them more isolated in the face of domestic and world public opinion.

    The article says that the Vietnamese people are closely watching the development of the situation in Indonesia. Together in the Southeast Asian region and having a common enemy—U.S. imperialism—the Vietnamese and Indonesian people have always attached importance to strengthening the fighting friendship between the two peoples and wholeheartedly supporting each other. At present, at a time when the Indonesian revolution is facing difficulties, the Vietnamese people reiterate their unbreakable solidarity with the Indonesian people. The Vietnamese people resolutely condemn the persecution actions of the Indonesian pro-American reactionary clique in barbarously killing Indonesian communists and patriotic progressive figures, and resolutely demand the restoration of the freedom of all Indonesian communists, patriotic progressive figures, and innocent Indonesian people who were arrested and imprisoned by the pro-American reactionary clique in the recent white terror.

    The article says that the Vietnamese people are determined to redouble their efforts and resolutely lead the cause of resisting U.S. aggression and saving the country to a glorious victory. This is seen as their obligation and active support to the fraternal Indonesian people.

    The article concludes: We believe that the Indonesian people have a strong tradition of unyielding revolutionary struggle, and with the strong support of the progressive people of the world, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party, they will surely overcome this severe test, not only defend the revolutionary achievements already made, but also bravely advance and strive for new victories.

    越南《学习》杂志说印度尼西亚亲美反动集团扑灭不了革命火焰
    印度尼西亚人民必将战胜敌人奋勇前进
    革命的历史从来就是用不断斗争来克服困难争取胜利的历史，美帝及其走狗的反革命行动并不说明他们强大而是失败后的反扑
    新华社河内十日电　越南《学习》杂志四月号发表文章，强烈谴责美帝国主义指使印度尼西亚反动集团策划政变，血腥屠杀印度尼西亚共产党人和印度尼西亚人民的残暴罪行。文章表示，越南人民坚决支持印度尼西亚人民的斗争，并且相信印度尼西亚人民在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，一定会取得革命的最后胜利。
    文章说，世界进步舆论正在强烈谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动集团迫害和杀害印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国进步人士。越南人民同全世界进步人民一起，坚决反对印度尼西亚亲美反动集团的白色恐怖，坚决驳斥它们制造的旨在诬蔑印度尼西亚共产党以及印度尼西亚民主、进步组织和为它们的滔天反革命罪行进行辩解的阴谋。印度尼西亚亲美反动集团不管玩弄什么样的阴谋诡计，也不能颠倒黑白，抹煞事实。最近几个月来在印度尼西亚连续发生的事件证明，他们才是祸国殃民的分子，阴谋推翻印度尼西亚政府和苏加诺总统，在印度尼西亚建立一个充当美国走狗的军事独裁制度，破坏印度尼西亚人民取得的革命果实。他们及其主子美帝国主义才是必须受到审判的罪人。
    文章谴责美帝国主义粗暴干涉印度尼西亚内政、怂恿和支持印度尼西亚反动派策划政变、推翻印度尼西亚政府和苏加诺总统的罪行。文章指出，通过美帝国主义的宣传论调和美国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的活动，人们清楚地看到，在印度尼西亚反动集团的后面，有美帝国主义的血腥魔爪在拉线操纵。美帝国主义清楚地暴露了它是造成印度尼西亚目前混乱情况的主谋和罪魁祸首，是印度尼西亚革命和人民的不共戴天的敌人。
    文章说，这一点并不奇怪，因为美帝国主义长久以来就玩弄种种手段妄图把一个人口众多、有着丰富资源、在东南亚有着多方面的重要战略地位的国家印度尼西亚变成它的新型殖民地和军事基地。
    文章说，过去，印度尼西亚政府曾经公布关于美帝国主义粗暴干涉印度尼西亚内部事务的许多具体和确凿的证据。美帝国主义帮助和怂恿亲美反动集团集合在所谓“将领委员会”中策划政变推翻印度尼西亚合法政府的阴谋已经暴露无遗。
    文章说，翁东中校和其他爱国军官勇敢地起来保卫印度尼西亚合法政府，反对亲美反动集团的政变阴谋。翁东中校和他的朋友的正义行动虽然没有成功，但为揭露美帝国主义及其走狗在印度尼西亚的不可告人的阴谋作出了贡献。
    文章说，印度尼西亚亲美反动集团诬蔑印度尼西亚共产党，对印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国进步人士进行极其野蛮的迫害活动，就完全暴露了他们的反革命面目。据许多印度尼西亚消息，自一九六五年十月初以来，就有二十五万人以上被他们杀害，成十万人被他们监禁和虐待。
    文章指出，印度尼西亚革命正面临着严重的考验，但是最后的胜利必定属于印度尼西亚人民。印度尼西亚革命和世界各国革命的历史经验表明，革命道路并不是平坦的。革命的总的和长期的规律是不断向前发展，但是由于种种客观和主观原因，尤其是敌人的狡猾阴谋和疯狂的对抗，使得革命在一个时候和一个地方有可能暂时停顿或倒退。因此，革命的历史从来都是用不断的斗争来克服困难，争取胜利的历史。革命者任何时候都要做好精神上和力量上的准备来克服种种困难，而每次克服了困难以后，就会取得新的胜利，最后的胜利也会早日到来。
    文章说，印度尼西亚革命的历史经验表明，不管印度尼西亚亲美反动集团目前的迫害行动野蛮和疯狂到什么程度，也扑灭不了有着坚强不屈斗争传统的印度尼西亚人民的革命火焰。印度尼西亚人民在荷兰殖民者的统治和日本法西斯集团的统治时期，曾不断奋起反抗侵略者。自从取得民族独立以来，印度尼西亚人民连续进行斗争，反对外来的帝国主义，尤其是美帝国主义的干涉和破坏。印度尼西亚共产党经历了长期英勇和艰苦的斗争。四十五年多以来，印度尼西亚共产党两次遭到大规模迫害，长期被迫在极其困难的秘密条件下进行活动，但是党的力量仍然不断发展。印度尼西亚亲美反动集团企图用鲜血和火焰来消灭印度尼西亚共产党和民主进步力量。他们的阴谋必定失败。在英雄的印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，坚强不屈的印度尼西亚人民将起来斩断反动集团的血腥魔爪，不让他们继续横行霸道，破坏革命。在革命斗争熔炉中得到锤炼的印度尼西亚共产党将越过目前的严峻考验，巩固和发展自己的力量，以便继续引导印度尼西亚的革命事业向前发展。文章说，当前的时代是社会主义革命和民族解放革命的时代。亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各地正在日益蓬勃地掀起革命风暴。以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义正在包括美国在内的各地遭到连续进攻。仅在东南亚，美帝国主义就正在遭到许多惨重的失败，在越南和老挝等地深深地陷入泥潭。美帝国主义和印度尼西亚亲美反动集团的反革命行动并不能说明他们强大。从世界范围内来看，这只不过是美帝国主义长久以来遭到进攻和失败的全部处境中的部分的反扑而已。从印度尼西亚范围内来看，这也不过是反革命势力经过成十年被人民的革命力量压倒和打败过程中的一时的反扑而已。亲美反动集团的极端明目张胆的祸国殃民的行为，使他们在国内和世界广泛舆论面前更加孤立。
    文章说，越南人民密切注视着印度尼西亚局势的发展。一起处在东南亚地区，又有着共同敌人——美帝国主义的越南和印度尼西亚两国人民，一贯都重视加强两国人民之间的战斗友谊，并全心全意互相支持。目前，在印度尼西亚革命遭到困难的时刻里，越南人民重申对印度尼西亚人民的牢不可破的团结情谊。越南人民坚决谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动集团野蛮杀害印度尼西亚共产党人和爱国进步人士的迫害行动，并坚决要求恢复在最近的白色恐怖中被亲美反动集团逮捕、监禁的所有印度尼西亚共产党人、爱国进步人士和印度尼西亚无辜人民的自由。
    文章说，越南人民决心加倍努力，坚决把抗美救国事业引向辉煌的胜利。把这看作是自己对兄弟的印度尼西亚人民的义务和积极支持。
    文章最后说：我们相信，印度尼西亚人民有着坚强不屈的革命斗争传统，在世界进步人民强有力的支持下，在印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，一定会度过这次严峻的考验，不仅保卫已经取得的革命果实，而且还会奋勇前进，争取新的胜利。
