    New York dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, 6th: Large numbers of Black students in Laurel, Mississippi, have held demonstrations and marches for days, protesting the school authorities' persecution of teachers and students who are fighting for Black rights, and protesting the various poor treatments students receive within the school. Demonstrators battled police who came to suppress them.
    On the 4th, about 500 Black students from colleges and high schools in Laurel gathered at Alcorn College, marched in groups, and sang Black struggle songs. At this time, the authorities dispatched a large number of police wearing helmets and gas masks to the scene to suppress them. They did not allow students to march and flagrantly released tear gas. Students were forced to defend themselves, fighting the police with bricks, stones, and glass bottles. According to official announcements, thirty-five demonstrators were arrested by the police.
    That night, 300 Black people came to support the demonstrating students, but seventy or eighty police officers guarded the school gate, not allowing them to enter. It is reported that 180 police officers in Laurel were heavily guarded that night. The authorities also transferred nearly 200 National Guard troops from other places.
    The next day, Black students held three more demonstrations in succession. The largest occurred in the evening, with the number of demonstrators increasing to 2,000. When they gathered on campus preparing to march, many police rushed to the scene, attempting to disperse them. The students bravely battled the police again. Subsequently, nearly 200 National Guard troops also arrived to participate in the suppression. However, despite all kinds of persecution, the demonstrating students still gathered together, singing struggle songs and persisting in their demonstration. Another eight Black students were arrested that day.
    New York dispatch from Xinhua News Agency: Three hundred Black people in Cordele County, Georgia, held a march toward the county courthouse on March 31st to protest the poor learning conditions in Black schools.
    After the demonstration reached the courthouse, they angrily tore down an American flag hanging in the courthouse lawn and raised a flag they had made themselves. This flag read: "Freedom Now".
    Washington dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, 5th: Ninety Black agricultural workers and tenant farmers, expelled from plantations in Mississippi, marched and demonstrated in Washington on the 3rd and erected tents in Lafayette Park across from the White House to express their anger at Johnson regarding their desperate situation.
    These Black unemployed workers came to Washington on March 31st to fight against their plight. They were cruelly deprived of their jobs and homes by plantation owners and farmers. In the winter, they were forced to bring their old and young to camp in tents on the outskirts of Greenwood and Greenville, Mississippi, exposed to the wind and dew. (Attached picture)

    美国密西西比州黑人学生再度奋起示威
    当局出动大批军警进行镇压遭到激烈反抗
    一批失业农业工人到华盛顿白宫前搭起帐篷示威抗议庄园主迫害
    据新华社六日讯　纽约消息：美国密西西比州劳曼城大批黑人学生连日来举行示威游行，抗议学校当局对争取黑人权利的教师和学生进行迫害，并且抗议学生们在学校内所受的种种恶劣待遇。示威者同前来镇压的警察展开了搏斗。
    四日，劳曼城约五百名大、中学校黑人学生在奥尔康学院里集合，分队游行，并且高唱黑人斗争的歌曲。这时，当局出动了大批头戴钢盔和防毒面具的警察到现场镇压。他们不许学生游行，并且悍然施放催泪弹。学生们被迫自卫，用砖头、石块和玻璃瓶跟警察搏斗。据官方宣布，有三十五个示威者被警察逮捕。
    这天晚上，三百名黑人群众前来声援示威学生，但是七八十个警察把守着校门，不许他们进去。据报道，劳曼城的一百八十名警察在这天夜里戒备森严。当局还从别的地方调来了近二百名国民警卫队。
    第二天，黑人学生又接连举行了三次示威。其中最大的一次发生在晚上，示威群众增加到二千名。当他们聚集在校园里准备游行时，很多警察赶到现场，企图把他们驱散。学生们又勇敢地和警察展开了搏斗。接着，近二百名国民警卫队也赶来参加镇压。但是示威学生不顾种种迫害，仍然聚集在一起，高唱斗争歌曲，坚持示威。这一天又有八名黑人学生被捕。
    新华社讯　纽约消息：美国佐治亚州考德尔县的三百名黑人为了抗议黑人学校中恶劣的学习条件，在三月三十一日举行了一次向县法院进军的示威游行。
    示威队伍到法院以后，就愤怒地撕毁了悬挂在法院草坪上空的一面美国国旗，并且把他们自制的一面旗帜升了起来。这面旗帜上面写着：“现在就要自由”。
    据新华社五日讯　华盛顿消息：九十名来自密西西比州的被逐出庄园的黑人农业工人和佃农三日在华盛顿游行示威，并在白宫对面的拉斐特公园搭起帐篷，就他们的绝望处境向约翰逊提出愤怒的抗议。
    这些黑人失业者是在上月三十一日到华盛顿来为抗议他们的遭遇而斗争的。他们被庄园主和农场主残酷地剥夺了职业和家园。在冬天里，他们被迫扶老携幼地在密西西比州格林伍德城和格林维尔城郊外搭起帐篷、餐风露宿。（附图片）
