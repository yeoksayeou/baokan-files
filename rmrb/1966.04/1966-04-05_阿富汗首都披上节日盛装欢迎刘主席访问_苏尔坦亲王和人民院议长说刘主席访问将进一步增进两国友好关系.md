    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, April 3rd (Electric Dispatch) The citizens of Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, have been working diligently to prepare a warm welcome for the visit of Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China.

    Kabul is adorned in festive attire, with the national flags of Afghanistan and China flying on both sides of the road from the airport to the VIP guesthouse and on major buildings. Some streets have also erected colorful archways, displaying huge portraits of Chairman Liu Shaoqi and the King of Afghanistan, along with banners reading "Welcome" and "Long Live Afghan-Chinese Friendship." Many buildings and shop fronts have been freshly painted.

    The equestrian team for the Afghan national sport of "Buzkashi" (goat grabbing) performance, scheduled for the Chinese guests, has arrived in the capital from other regions. Artists are rushing to rehearse musical programs. One artist enthusiastically said, "I want to sing a Chinese song for Chairman Liu Shaoqi to express Afghan-Chinese friendship."

    On the 3rd, the evening newspapers here all published a full-page photograph of Chairman Liu Shaoqi. One editorial was titled "Our King and People's Guest," which reviewed the development of Afghan-Chinese friendship in detail. The editorial stated, "A year and a half ago, the visit of His Majesty the King and Queen of Afghanistan to the friendly neighbor, the People's Republic of China, was a glorious page in the history of relations between the two countries. The Chinese friends' very warm reception of the King of Afghanistan is the best example of the good neighborly and friendly feelings between the two peoples."

    The editorial stated that the Afghan people have always admired the Chinese people's past struggle against foreign aggression. This is similar to our struggle.

    The editorial is confident that Chairman Liu's visit will further enhance mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of the two countries.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kabul, April 3rd (Electric Dispatch) Afghan friends warmly welcome Chairman Liu's visit and highly praise Sino-Afghan friendship.

    Prince Sultan, Chairman of the Afghan-Chinese Friendship Association, recently met with Xinhua News Agency reporters here and said that the leaders and people of Afghanistan welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit with excitement. This visit will have a huge impact on further developing Afghan-Chinese friendly relations.

    He said that Afghan-Chinese friendship is as long-standing as the ancient civilizations of the two countries. In recent years, this friendship has developed even further. The demarcation of the Afghan-Chinese border is the best example, and this border will always be a symbol of Afghan-Chinese friendship.

    Prince Sultan said that it is a matter of pride that Afghanistan and China have never had any disputes. Although the two countries have different ideologies, they have a close friendship. Both hope for peace and have always lived together peacefully and amicably. He expressed his belief that Afghan-Chinese friendship will continue to be consolidated and developed, and that Chairman Liu Shaoqi's visit will surely push this friendship to a new climax.

    He also said: "As Chairman of the Afghan-Chinese Friendship Association, I will work hard to ensure the continuous development of Afghan-Chinese friendship."

    Abdul Zahir, Speaker of the Afghan People's Assembly, said that the Afghan King's visit to China in November 1964 and Chairman Liu Shaoqi's current visit to Afghanistan are very helpful in further enhancing mutual understanding and friendship between the two countries.

    He said: "Afghan-Chinese friendship has a correct and solid foundation. The two countries respect each other and both abide by the Bandung Principles." He said that Afghanistan and China, in a spirit of friendly, fraternal, and equal relations, have resolved the border issue and carried out economic and technical cooperation, which has created a good start for further development of friendship.

    The Speaker said that Afghanistan, as an Eastern country, has suffered from colonialism in its history, and it has sympathy for China. Today, China, after shaking off the shackles of colonialism, has entered the world's advanced ranks as a free nation. This gives Afghanistan confidence and courage, making it believe that it can also overcome difficulties like China. He wished China prosperity and progress.

    Kushkaki, Director of the Afghan official Eastern News Agency, said that Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his wife's visit to Afghanistan "will be a new milestone in the history of Afghan-Chinese friendly relations following the visit of His Majesty the King and Queen of Afghanistan to China."

    阿富汗首都披上节日盛装欢迎刘主席访问
    苏尔坦亲王和人民院议长说刘主席访问将进一步增进两国友好关系
    新华社喀布尔三日电　阿富汗首都喀布尔市民进行了紧张的准备工作，热烈欢迎中华人民共和国主席刘少奇的来访。
    喀布尔披上了节日的盛装，从机场通往贵宾馆的街道两旁和主要建筑物上，挂起了阿中两国国旗。有些街道上还搭起了彩牌楼，上面挂着刘少奇主席和阿富汗国王的巨幅肖象，和写有“欢迎”和“阿中友谊万岁”字样的横幅。不少建筑物和商店门面粉刷一新。
    预定为中国客人表演的阿富汗民族体育运动
  “抢羊”比赛的马队已从外地赶到首都。艺术家们在赶排音乐节目。一位艺术家热情地说，“我要唱一支中国歌给刘少奇主席听，以表达阿中友谊。”
    三日，这里的晚报都通版刊登了刘少奇主席的照片。有一篇社论的题目是《我们国王和人民的客人》，它详细地回顾了阿中两国友谊的发展。社论说：“一年半前，阿富汗国王和王后陛下对友好邻邦中华人民共和国的访问是两国关系史上光辉的一页。中国朋友对阿富汗国王非常热情的接待是两国人民相互睦邻友好感情的最好例证。”
    这篇社论说，阿富汗人民一向以敬佩的眼光看待中国人民过去反对外国侵略的斗争。这同我们的斗争是相似的。
    社论确信，刘主席的来访，必将进一步增强两国人民的相互了解和友谊。
    新华社喀布尔三日电　阿富汗朋友热烈欢迎刘主席访问并盛赞中阿友谊。
    阿中友协主席苏尔坦亲王最近在这里接见新华社记者说，阿富汗国家领导人和人民以兴奋的心情欢迎刘少奇主席的来访。这次访问将对进一步发展阿中友好关系产生巨大的影响。
    他说，阿中友谊象两国的古老文明那样悠久。近年来这种友谊更加发展了。阿中边界的划定就是最好的例子，这条边界将永远是阿中友谊的象征。
    苏尔坦亲王说，值得骄傲的是阿中两国从未发生过任何争端。两国虽然意识形态不同，但有着亲密的友谊，它们都希望和平，一直是和平友好相处。他表示相信，阿中友谊将不断巩固和发展，而刘少奇主席的来访必然会使这种友谊推向新的高潮。
    他还说：“作为阿中友协主席，我将努力使阿中友谊不断发展。”
    阿富汗人民院议长阿卜杜勒·查希尔说，一九六四年十一月阿富汗国王访华和刘少奇主席目前访阿，对进一步增进两国之间的相互了解和友谊是非常有帮助的。
    他说：“阿中友谊有着正确和坚实的基础，两国相互尊重，都遵守万隆原则。”他说，阿中两国本着友好的兄弟般的平等的精神，解决了边界问题，并且进行了经济和技术合作，这为进一步发展友谊创造了良好的开端。
    这位议长说，阿富汗作为一个东方国家，在历史上遭受过殖民主义的苦难，它对中国怀有同情感。今天中国在摆脱殖民主义的枷锁后，作为一个自由的民族进入了世界先进行列。这给阿富汗以信心和勇气，使它相信也能象中国那样克服困难。他祝愿中国繁荣和进步。
    阿富汗官方的东方通讯社社长库什卡基说，刘少奇主席和夫人访阿“将是继阿富汗国王和王后陛下访华后，阿中友好关系史上一个新的里程碑”。（附图片）
