	I grew up under the single-handed cultivation and nurturing of the Party. I have some ideas about serving the people and working for the revolution, but in my mind, there is also a petty-bourgeois kingdom that has not been thoroughly transformed. While calculating the big account of the revolution, I often have a small account of my own. If I don’t repeatedly struggle against this small account, its territory will grow larger and larger.
	From my personal experience, I realize that only by diligently studying Chairman Mao’s writings, arming myself with Mao Zedong Thought, and launching frequent ideological struggles can my personal calculations gradually decrease, until they are finally eliminated, and I truly achieve proletarian revolutionization. For example, when I first accepted the task of rehearsing the role of Li Tiemei in "The Red Lantern," on the one hand, I was happy, feeling that this was the leadership's cultivation and trust in us young actors; on the other hand, I was a little nervous, because I was performing on the same stage with actors who had many years of stage experience. Wouldn’t performing with them show that my level was too poor? Especially in the ninth scene, when Li Yuhe and Grandma Li sacrificed themselves, leaving only Li Tiemei alone, could I hold the stage? When the word "I" took the lead, the stumbling block came, and I became impatient when the rehearsal was not going smoothly; I wanted to hear other people's opinions, but I was afraid of being criticized. At this time, I would become complacent when I occasionally heard two words of praise… In short, the more distracting thoughts I had, the worse the play became, and the further I was from the character of Tiemei in the play. What was the problem? With the help of the leadership, I carefully analyzed my own thinking and realized that the reason I was nervous when acting was the result of considering personal gains and losses. In order to arm my thoughts and eliminate the word "I" in my mind, I studied the article "Serve the People" with this problem in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Our team is entirely for the liberation of the people and works entirely in the interests of the people." Comparing my thoughts with these words, I felt very ashamed. How many revolutionary martyrs shed their blood and sacrificed their lives for the revolutionary cause? For the sake of revolutionary interests, they never considered themselves, but when I was performing a revolutionary play, I was considering whether I could stand out personally. How could I play a revolutionary hero well? I criticized these "distracting thoughts" and further clarified the purpose of acting for the revolution, determined to play Tiemei and learn from Tiemei, and perform the play well with revolutionary spirit. After discarding my personal baggage, I made faster progress in the rehearsal.
	However, ideological transformation is not a one-time thing, and we must also have the spirit of continuous revolution. After performing "The Red Lantern," I accepted the task of rehearsing another play. In this play, I was assigned to play a young man who initially had some shortcomings in his thinking, but corrected his wrong thoughts through a series of education and devoted himself to working in the most difficult places. As soon as I read the script, I had a wave of unpleasant emotions. I thought: If I play such an unlovable character, wouldn't the audience's impression of me as an actor also deteriorate after watching the play? The word "I" emerged again, and personal distracting thoughts attacked me again. Since I had an ideological reversal when I started rehearsing "The Red Lantern," the concept of "enemy situation" in my mind was stronger than before. At this time, I immediately felt that this emotion was not right, and immediately opened "In Memory of Norman Bethune." Chairman Mao's words, like a searchlight, suddenly illuminated the wrong things in my heart. Chairman Mao said in this article: "Quite a few people are irresponsible in their work, choosing the easy tasks and shying away from the difficult ones, pushing the heavy burdens onto others and taking the light ones for themselves. When faced with a matter, they first consider their own interests and then the interests of others." Wasn't I committing this very mistake?
	As soon as I received the script, I first considered what personal benefits I would gain after the performance and what losses I would suffer. Then, where was the word "revolution" placed? Chairman Mao also taught us that literature and art must serve politics and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers. If I were to consider myself in this way, wouldn't I be acting to serve myself? I severely criticized this wrong thinking, corrected the purpose of rehearsal, and happily accepted the task of playing this role. I think, in the future, as long as the revolution needs it, I will do whatever I am asked to do, and I must do it well. I am determined to gradually become "a man who has broken away from vulgar tastes, a man who is beneficial to the people."
	Since I graduated from the Chinese Opera School, for more than six years, under the cultivation of the Party, I have rehearsed many plays and heard a lot of applause and praise. This situation often makes my mind hot and I don’t know how high the sky is and how thick the earth is. Whenever this happens, many teachers and comrades who care about me come to "cool down" my brain. Precisely because of this, I am still able to look at achievements and honors relatively calmly in my consciousness. Does this mean that I am completely correct in dealing with this problem? No. First of all, there is a distance between reason and emotion. Although I understand rationally that my level is still far behind and my contribution to the Party and the people is still too small, I can't help but be complacent when I hear one or two words of praise. Although I rationally recognize the strengths of others and am willing to learn from them, this is often not the case emotionally. I often use my own strengths to compare with the weaknesses of others. This comparison leads to blindness again.
	In addition, when discussing issues with others or listening to other people's opinions, I am sometimes self-righteous and cannot calmly consider other people's opinions, which is actually a manifestation of pride. For example, in the early stage of rehearsing "The Red Lantern," someone said that the Tiemei I played lacked the temperament of a working-class daughter. I thought: I didn't grow up in a working-class family, so how could I look like one? It can't be blamed on me if I don't look like one! Chairman Mao taught us to be modest and prudent, to guard against arrogance and rashness, and to "be good at listening to the opinions of the masses," and "even if others say something wrong, we should let them finish speaking and then slowly explain it." But I violated this teaching. Now, I increasingly realize that an arrogant person has the shortest vision and the lowest spirit. I must always be vigilant, guard against arrogance and rashness, and demand myself with the high standards of a proletarian revolutionary successor in everything.
	In the past, I heard people say, "Achievements belong to the Party and the masses, and shortcomings are my own." I always felt that this statement was not true and could not understand the thinking of the people who said this. For more than two years, the rehearsal practice of "The Red Lantern" has powerfully educated me, making me increasingly feel that this sentence is too correct and is what I want to say in my heart. "The Red Lantern" is the product of a three-way combination and was produced under the kind guidance of the Party and the joint efforts of all the comrades in the troupe. Many leading comrades gave clear, specific, and very important instructions from the theme of the play to every detail. Every line of dialogue, every action, every singing melody, and every percussion pattern in the whole play embodies the labor of many comrades. Even my makeup has been guided by everyone. We actors only directly express the characters on the stage. If there were not so many unsung heroes working hard behind the scenes, what could we actors do alone? Take teacher Li Jinquan as an example. He used to be a famous old female actor. In "The Red Lantern," he was responsible for the singing design. He really put in a lot of effort, but we won the applause when singing. In addition, many actors are responsible for moving props, pulling the curtain, and projecting subtitle slides… They sweated a lot and spent a lot of effort. There were also many audience members, especially letters from workers, peasants, and soldiers, which greatly helped to continuously improve our play. Aren't these all the power of the masses? How can honors be counted in my own account? Besides, I have not performed this play well yet, and it is still far from the requirements of the Party and the people. The rehearsal practice of "The Red Lantern" very vividly and concretely illustrates the truth that no achievements can be made without the Party and the masses. In the past, I thought that I had good conditions and that it was right for the Party to cultivate me. Now I understand: Isn't the so-called "condition" also entirely the result of the Party's single-handed cultivation? Without the Party, where would I be today? All that I can do for the people today is given to me by the Party. In the future, I must study Chairman Mao's books well, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, thoroughly transform my own thinking, and serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers for the rest of my life!

    按毛主席的指示办事
    ——学习毛主席著作的一些体会
    刘长瑜
    我是在党一手培养、哺育下长大成人的。为人民服务、为革命而工作的思想也有一些，但在我的头脑中，也还有一个未经彻底改造的小资产阶级王国。在算革命大账的同时，往往自己还有一笔小账。对于这笔小账，如果不反复进行斗争，它的地盘就会越占越大。
    从我亲身体会中，认识到只有努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，展开经常的思想斗争，个人的小算盘才有可能越来越少，直到最后被清除，真正做到无产阶级革命化。比如：我在开始接受排演《红灯记》中李铁梅一角的任务时，一方面高兴，感到这是领导对我们青年演员的培养与信任；另一方面又有些紧张，因为和我同台演出的是有着多年舞台经验的演员，同他们一起演出，不是会显出我的水平太差了么？特别是第九场李玉和、李奶奶牺牲了，就剩下李铁梅一个人的戏，我能压得住台么？“我”字一当头，拦路虎就来了，一遇上排戏不顺利，心里就急躁；想听听别人的意见，可又怕人家批评。这时，偶尔听了两句赞扬的话，便沾沾自喜……总之，杂念越多，戏越排不好，离剧中人铁梅的距离也就越远。问题在哪儿呢？通过领导上帮助，我认真地分析了自己的思想，认识到我演戏时所以紧张，是考虑个人得失的结果。为了武装思想，歼灭头脑中的“我”字，我带着这个问题学习了《为人民服务》一文。毛主席说：“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”用这些话来对照自己的思想，我感到很惭愧，多少先烈为革命抛头颅、洒热血，为了革命利益，他们从不考虑自己，而我却在演革命戏的时候，考虑我个人能不能突出的问题，这怎么能演好革命英雄呢？我批判了这些“杂念”，进一步明确了为革命而演戏的目的，决心演铁梅、学铁梅，以革命的精神把戏演好。个人包袱丢了，再排起戏来，进步也就快多了。
    可是，思想改造并不是一劳永逸的，还必须有不断革命的精神。在演出《红灯记》后，我又接受了排演另一出戏的任务。在这个戏中，派我扮演一个开始思想上有些缺点、通过一系列的教育，纠正了错误思想，投身到最艰苦的地方去工作的青年。我刚读到剧本，就产生了一阵不愉快的情绪。心想：我演这么一个不可爱的人物，观众看戏后，不是对我这个演员的印象也要变坏了吗？“我”字又冒出来了，个人杂念又向我进攻了，由于在开始排《红灯记》时，有过一次思想反复，头脑中的“敌情”观念比过去也就强一些了。这时，我立即感到，这股情绪不对头，马上翻开了《纪念白求恩》，毛主席的话象探照灯一样，刷地一下子把我心里的错误东西照出来了。毛主席在这篇文章里说：“不少的人对工作不负责任，拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己挑轻的。一事当前，先替自己打算，然后再替别人打算。”我不正好是犯这一条毛病么？
    一接到剧本先替自己打算一下：演出后个人会得到什么好处，会有什么损失，那么“革命”二字又放到什么位置上去了呢？毛主席还教导我们，文艺必须为政治服务、为工农兵服务，我这样为个人打算，岂不成了演戏为我自己服务了吗？我狠狠地批判了这种错误思想，端正了排演的目的，愉快地接受了扮演这个角色的任务。我想，今后只要是革命需要，叫我干什么，我就干什么，并且一定要干好。我立志要逐步做到“一个脱离了低级趣味的人，一个有益于人民的人。”
    我从中国戏校毕业以后，六年多来，在党的培养下，排演了不少剧目，听到过不少掌声和赞扬的话，这种情况往往容易使自己头脑发热，不知天多高地多厚。每当这种时候，总有不少关心我的老师、同志来给我的脑子“降温”。也正因如此，我在意识上还是能够比较冷静地看待成绩和荣誉的。这么说，是不是我在处理这个问题上完全正确呢？不是的。首先，理智与感情就有距离，理智上虽然也明白自己的水平还差得很远，对党对人民的贡献还太小，可是听到一两句赞扬的话，自己就忍不住沾沾自喜。理智上虽然承认人家的长处，也愿意向人家学习，感情上却往往不是这样，常用自己的长处去比人家的短处，这一比，盲目性就又来了。
    另外，就是在与人家讨论问题或听取别人的意见时，有时自以为是，不能冷静地考虑人家的意见，这实际上也是一种骄傲的表现。比如，在排演《红灯记》的初期，有人说我演的铁梅缺乏工人阶级女儿的气质，我就想：本来我就不是在工人家庭长大的，怎么可能象呢？演得不象也不能怪我呀！毛主席教导我们要谦虚谨慎、戒骄戒躁，要“善于听取群众意见”，“别人说得不对，也应该让别人说完，然后，慢慢加以解释。”我却正好违背了这一教导。现在，我越来越认识到：一个骄傲的人，是眼光最短浅、精神最低下的，我一定要时刻警惕，戒骄戒躁，处处用无产阶级革命接班人的高标准来要求自己。
    过去，我听人家讲“成绩是党和群众的，缺点是我自己的。”我总感觉这话说得不真实，不能理解说这种话的人的思想。两年多来，《红灯记》的排演实践有力地教育了我，使我越来越觉得这句话说得太对了，就是我心里要说的话。《红灯记》是三结合的产物，是在党亲切教导下、在全团同志的共同努力下产生的。许多领导同志从戏的主题思想到每一个细节都给予了明确、具体而又非常重要的指示。全戏的每一句台词，每一个动作，每一句唱腔，每一个锣经，都有着不少同志的劳动，就是我在化妆上，也都得到了大家的指点。我们这些演员，只是在台上把角色直接表现出来了，假若没有那么多幕后英雄的辛勤劳动，光靠我们几个演员又能作出什么来呢？就拿李金泉老师来说，他过去是个著名的老旦演员，在《红灯记》中负责唱腔设计，他真是费了不少心血，可是，在演唱时，却是由我们博得了掌声。另外，不少演员负责搬道具、拉大幕，打幻灯字幕……流了不少汗，花了不少劳动。还有许多观众，特别是工农兵同志的来信，对我们这出戏的不断提高，帮助很大。这一些，不都是群众的力量么？有了荣誉怎么能算在自己账上呢？何况，我现在并没有把这出戏演好，距离党和人民的要求还很远呢。《红灯记》的排演实践，非常生动具体地说明了没有党和群众，就不能取得任何成绩的真理。过去我曾认为自己条件好，党培养我是应该的，现在我明白了：所谓“条件”不也完全是党一手培育的结果么？没有党，哪有我的今天？我今天能为人民做一点事，也全是党给我的。今后，我一定要好好读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，按毛主席的指示办事，彻底改造自己的思想，为工农兵服务一辈子！
