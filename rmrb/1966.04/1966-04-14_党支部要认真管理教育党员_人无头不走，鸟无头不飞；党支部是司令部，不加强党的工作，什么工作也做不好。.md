    The Party Branch Must Conscientiously Manage and Educate Party Members
    “A man without a head cannot walk, a bird without a head cannot fly; the Party branch is the command headquarters, without strengthening the Party's work, no work can be done well.”
    Wang Lian, Party Branch Secretary of the Dongshizigou Brigade, Shizigou Commune, Chongli County, Hebei Province.
    Our brigade has four production teams, with a total of nineteen Party members. Our branch was separated from another branch in 1962 and established independently. Over the years, through studying Chairman Mao's works, implementing the Party's various policies, and carrying out the socialist education movement, our branch has strengthened the management and education of Party members, enabling Party members to continuously improve their class consciousness, play an exemplary leading role in various tasks, and promote various tasks. Grain production has increased, and sideline occupations have also been correspondingly developed, and the living standards of commune members have continuously improved.
    Strengthening the Party's work is the most important task of the Party branch. However, our branch has experienced a tortuous process. In the past, we paid more attention to specific production affairs and less attention to the Party's work. As a result, work was not done well, and more and more problems arose. The leadership core of the Party branch was not strong, and some Party members did not have a high level of ideological awareness. What to do? We must establish a strong branch, and we must educate all Party members well.
    Arming Party Members with Mao Zedong Thought
    Party members must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, constantly improve their consciousness, and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end.
    Mao Zedong Thought is the key to everything. If we want to give play to the Party branch's role as a fighting fortress and the role of Party members, we must first arm the minds of Party members with Mao Zedong Thought. Over the years, the Party branch has insisted on organizing Party members to earnestly study Chairman Mao's works. Initially, twenty-seven people participated in this study, but now it has expanded to one hundred and thirty people, including not only Party members and members of the Communist Youth League, but also activists among the poor and lower-middle peasants.
    Over the years, we have studied more than twenty articles such as "Serve the People," and have also continuously studied the Party Program and the Party Constitution. Through study, everyone has raised their class consciousness, established the determination to be unafraid of difficulties and to advance bravely, and the idea of carrying the revolution through to the end, and has gradually learned to guide their actions with Mao Zedong Thought. Party members Wang Ruixi, Zhang Pu, and others went outside the dam to buy yam seeds. In order to ensure that not a single yam was frozen, they covered their quilts and leather coats on the cart every night, while they themselves were freezing in the store. Someone asked why they did this? They said: "These are collective property and cannot be lost. Norman Bethune sacrificed his life for the liberation of the Chinese people, so what does it matter if we freeze a little for the collective interest." Under the education of Mao Zedong Thought, good people and good deeds have emerged continuously.
    Grasping the "Three Meetings and One Class"
    By grasping the "Three Meetings and One Class," the work of the branch has been improved, and the relationship between the Party and the masses has become closer.
    In 1963, the commune Party committee convened a joint meeting of branch secretaries, using many examples to repeatedly illustrate the importance of strengthening the Party's work, and stipulated a system of Party day activities. We discussed the opinions of the commune Party committee among the Party members, and everyone said: "A man without a head cannot walk, a bird without a head cannot fly; the Party branch is the command headquarters, without strengthening the Party's work, no work can be done well." We discussed how to strengthen the Party's work, firmly implement the Party day activity system, with branch meetings on the first of each month, Party classes on the eleventh, and organizational life on the twenty-first. The branch committee meets every ten days. No matter how busy we are, these activities are never interrupted, so that the majority of Party members are regularly subject to organizational supervision. Sometimes there is rush work that easily encroaches on the time for Party day activities. Our approach is to either move them earlier or later, or move them to the production site. In order to ensure that the effect of the "Three Meetings and One Class" can be implemented in production and work, the Party branch has held several discussions and adopted two measures: first, earnestly adopt the opinions of the masses and act according to the opinions of the masses; second, the secretary takes the lead, the branch committee members take the lead, do more practical things, and talk less empty talk. In this way, the masses see that our work style has improved and are willing to speak their minds. Now, no matter what kind of meeting is held, or in daily work, from Party members to the masses, they speak their minds, raise their opinions, and criticize what they see as wrong. Facts have proved that as long as the Party branch truly grasps the Party's work, it can adhere to the Party's regular activities.
    Giving Full Play to the Role of Party Members
    By mobilizing all Party members, the branch can truly play the role of a fighting fortress.
    The Party's leadership over the masses should not only be reflected in the branch committee members, but also in every Party member. Only when all Party members are mobilized can the Party branch's role as a fighting fortress be brought into play. Therefore, over the years, we have paid special attention to giving play to the initiative, creativity, and fighting spirit of all Party members. In production and construction, we educate Party members to play an exemplary leading role, to endure hardship before others, enjoy comfort after others, and take on heavy burdens and hard work. Our requirement is: branch committee members should become role models for Party members, and Party members should become role models for the masses.
    In work, we adhere to the system of combining collective leadership with individual responsibility. In order to facilitate work, in addition to the branch committee members implementing a combination of dividing lines and contracting teams, most Party members have been arranged according to their individual circumstances. In this way, everyone has something to do, and the work is not chaotic.
    In order to promote work, we often educate Party members to be unafraid of difficulties and to go to the most difficult places. Now, most Party members can respond to the branch's call in a timely manner and go to the most difficult places.
    Strict Requirements, Timely Education
    Party members are the advanced fighters of the working class, and should be strictly required with high standards, and should be educated at all times and in all places.
    Party members are the advanced fighters of the working class and must be strictly required with high standards and educated in a timely manner. Our approach is: to grasp living ideas and correct Party members' undesirable tendencies in thought and action at all times and in all places. Party member Song Mei liked to make sarcastic remarks and was not active in labor. Once, because the quality of grass cutting was not high and one work point was deducted, he quarreled with the team leader. We educated him by laying out the facts and reasoning with him. We explained that Party members should help the team leader do a good job, should play a leading role, and should not be concerned about quality when working, and should not disobey commands. After criticism and help, Song Mei underwent a great transformation. He not only made a self-criticism, but also apologized to the team leader, and worked diligently.
    In the implementation of the Party's policies, some Party members often proceed from the interests of small collectives or individuals, and therefore it is particularly necessary to educate Party members to conscientiously implement policies, proceed from the interests of the Party and the people, have the whole country in mind, and have the world in view. In 1964, when delivering public grain, Party member Zhang Shichang delivered public grain to the third team, but the quality was not high. The grain depot asked him to process it on the spot, but he only processed the grain on the mouth of the bag. After the branch discovered this, it specifically convened a group meeting to discuss the matter. Some told him about his family history, and some laid out the facts and reasoned with him. With everyone's help, Zhang Shichang woke up. He said with emotion: "I have let down the Party. Before liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered, without food or clothing, and were exploited by the landlords. Now, we have turned ourselves over and are living a good life. How can we be worthy of the Party by doing this!" This incident was also an education for other Party members and the masses.
    Leaders need to be considerate of the masses, care about the masses, and solve the practical problems of the masses. Over the years, under the premise of strict requirements, we have continuously helped Party members solve their difficulties in life and cared about their sufferings. This is actually a kind of intimate education for Party members. Party member Li Wanzhen's family had many people and few laborers, and they were short of food for years. The Party branch, on the one hand, explained to him the principle of "whoever manages the house is responsible for eating and dressing" and asked him to be thrifty; at the same time, after discussion by the masses, they also helped him solve some practical difficulties. Therefore, he worked very actively.

### 党支部要认真管理教育党员  “人无头不走，鸟无头不飞；党支部是司令部，不加强党的工作，什么工作也做不好。”

    党支部要认真管理教育党员
    “人无头不走，鸟无头不飞；党支部是司令部，不加强党的工作，什么工作也做不好。”
    河北省崇礼县狮子沟公社东狮子沟大队党支部书记　王连
    我们大队有四个生产队，共有十九名党员。我们支部是在一九六二年从别的支部分出来，单独建立起来的。几年以来，经过学习毛主席著作，贯彻党的各项政策和进行社会主义教育运动，我们支部加强了对党员的管理教育，使党员不断提高阶级觉悟，在各项工作中发挥模范带头作用，促进了各项工作。粮食增产，牧副业也得到相应的发展，社员生活水平不断提高。
    加强党的工作，是党支部最重要的工作。可是，我们支部却经历过一段曲折的过程。过去生产上具体的事务抓得多，党的工作抓得少，工作做不好，问题越来越多。党支部领导核心不坚强，有些党员思想觉悟不高。怎么办呢？必须建立一个坚强的支部，必须教育好全体党员。
    用毛泽东思想武装党员
    党员要用毛泽东思想武装自己，不断提高觉悟，坚决把革命进行到底
    毛泽东思想是把万能的钥匙。要想发挥支部的战斗堡垒作用，发挥党员的作用，首先要用毛泽东思想武装党员的头脑。几年来，党支部坚持组织党员认真学习毛主席著作。参加这个学习的，起初有二十七人，现在已扩大到一百三十人，其中不仅有党员、团员，而且还有贫下中农积极分子。
    几年来，我们学习了《为人民服务》等二十多篇文章，还不断学习党纲、党章。经过学习，大家提高了阶级觉悟，树立起临难不畏、勇往直前的决心和革命到底的思想，并逐渐学会用毛泽东思想指导自己的行动。党员王瑞喜、张普等三人，到坝外买山药种，为了保证不让一根山药受冻，每晚把自己的被子、皮衣等蒙在车上，他们自己却在店里受冻。有人问为啥这样？他们说：“这是集体的东西，不能受损失。白求恩为了中国人民的解放事业，牺牲了自己的生命，我们为了集体利益受点冻算得什么。”在毛泽东思想教育下，好人好事不断出现。
    抓好“三会一课”
    抓了“三会一课”，支部工作有了改进，党和群众的关系更密切了
    一九六三年公社党委召开支部书记联席会，用许多事例反复说明加强党的工作的重要性，并规定了党日活动制度。我们把公社党委的意见在党员中一讨论，大家都说：“人无头不走，鸟无头不飞；党支部是司令部，不加强党的工作，什么工作也做不好。”我们讨论了如何加强党的工作，坚定地执行党日活动制度，每月初一是支部大会，十一是上党课，二十一过组织生活。支部委员会每十天开会一次。不论怎样忙，这些活动从不间断，使广大党员经常受到组织监督。有时候有突击性工作，容易侵占党日活动时间。我们的办法一是提前错后，二是搬到生产现场。为了使“三会一课”的效果能落实在生产和工作上，党支部进行过几次讨论，采取两条措施：一是认真采纳群众的意见，按群众意见办事；二是书记带头，支委带头，多办实事，少说空话。这样，群众看见我们作风有了改进，有话也愿说了。现在，不论开什么会，也不论在日常工作中，从党员到群众，有话就说，有意见就提，看见不对的就批评。事实证明，只要党支部把党的工作真正抓紧，就能坚持好党的经常活动。
    充分发挥党员的作用
    把党员都发动起来，支部才能真正发挥战斗堡垒作用
    党对群众的领导不仅要体现在支部委员身上，而且要体现在每个党员身上，所有党员都动起来，才能发挥党支部的战斗堡垒作用。因此，几年来我们特别注意发挥全体党员的主动性、创造性和战斗精神。在生产建设上，教育党员起模范带头作用，要吃苦在先，享受在后，挑重担，干硬活。我们的要求是：支部委员要成为党员的榜样，党员要成为群众的榜样。
    在工作上，坚持集体领导与个人负责相结合的制度。为了便利工作，除支委实行分线和包队相结合的办法外，绝大部分党员都因人制宜地作了安排。这样，人人有事干，工作不混乱。
    为了推动工作，经常教育党员不怕困难，到最艰苦的地方去。现在，绝大部分党员，都能及时响应支部的号召，到最艰苦的地方。
    严格要求，及时教育
    党员是工人阶级的先进战士，应该用高标准严格要求，应该随时随地进行教育
    党员是工人阶级的先进战士，必须用高标准严格要求，及时教育。我们的办法是：抓活思想，随时随地纠正党员思想上、行动上的不良倾向。党员宋美，爱说风凉话，不积极劳动。一次因为打草质量不高，少记了一分工，就跟队长吵架。我们就通过摆事实、讲道理的办法，对他进行了教育。说明党员应该帮助队长做好工作，要起带头作用，不能干活不讲质量，不服从指挥。经过批评帮助，宋美大有转变。他不仅做了检查，还向队长道了歉，干活也踏实了。
    在贯彻执行党的方针政策中，有的党员往往从小集体或个人利益出发，因此特别需要教育党员认真执行政策，从党和人民的利益出发，胸怀全国，放眼世界。一九六四年交公粮时，党员张士昌给三队交公粮，质量不高，粮库让他当场加工，但是，他只把麻袋口上的粮加了工。支部发觉后，专门召开小组会讨论这件事。有的给他说家史，有的给他摆事实，讲道理。在大家帮助下，张士昌醒悟过来。他感动地说：“我辜负了党，解放前，咱贫下中农受苦，无吃无穿，受尽地主剥削；如今，我们翻了身，过上了好日子，这样干，怎能对得起党！”这件事对其他党员和群众也是一个教育。
    领导者需要体贴群众，关怀群众，解决群众的实际问题。几年来，我们在严格要求的前提下，不断帮助党员解决生活上的困难，关心他们的疾苦。这实际上是对党员的亲切的教育。党员李万珍家里人多劳力少，连年缺粮，党支部一方面向他说明“吃饭穿衣看当家”的道理，要他节约；同时经过群众讨论，也帮助他解决了一些实际困难。因此，他工作很积极。
