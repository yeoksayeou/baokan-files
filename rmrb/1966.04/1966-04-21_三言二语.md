	Three Words Two Phrases		      A Futile Outcry
	Australian Foreign Minister Hasluck, in New York, was waving the flag and shouting to drum up "allies" for the U.S. scheme of getting countries to jump into the water, clamoring that Western European countries could not "sit comfortably there" and watch the U.S. fail in its aggression against Vietnam. This reminds one of the rabbit in Aesop's Fables, who had its tail cut off and then hoped that all rabbits would cut off their tails.
	Hasluck's cries are in vain. Because many of the U.S.'s "allies" can see clearly that it is better to "sit comfortably there" than to wallow in the mire like the Australian ruling clique.		      A Guilty Conscience
	The Indian reactionaries are extremely annoyed and shouting loudly about the further strengthening of friendly relations between China and Pakistan; however, it is full of contradictions and utter confusion.
	Indian Defense Minister Chavan clamored on the 13th that India would not be intimidated by the "threat" from China and Pakistan. However, he also said that China and Pakistan had contracted some kind of "Indo-phobia." What is going on here? How can the two countries, China and Pakistan, which are "threatening" India, become countries that are afraid of the Indian reactionaries? If China and Pakistan were intimidated by the Indian reactionaries, why would the Indian reactionaries shout that they are not intimidated? Such nonsense can only show that the Indian reactionaries want to threaten China and Pakistan and are afraid of suffering again, which is truly the mark of a guilty conscience.

    三言二语		      徒然的呐喊
    澳大利亚外长哈斯勒克在纽约为美国拉“盟国”下水的阴谋摇旗呐喊，叫嚷西欧国家不能“舒服地坐在那里”看着美国侵略越南失败。这使人想起《伊索寓言》中的那只兔子，它自己被人剪掉了尾巴，却希望所有的兔子都把尾巴剪去。
    哈斯勒克的叫喊是徒劳的。因为美国的许多“盟国”都看得清楚，与其象澳大利亚统治集团那样狼狈地跟着美国在泥潭里打滚，不如“舒服地坐在那里”更好些。		      做贼心虚
    印度反动派对于中国和巴基斯坦友好关系的进一步加强，极为恼火，大叫大喊；但矛盾百出，混乱之至。
    印度国防部长恰范十三日叫嚷，印度不会被中巴的“威胁”吓倒。可是，他又说什么中巴两国得了一种什么“恐印病”。这是怎么一回事呢？“威胁”印度的中巴两国怎么又成了害怕印度反动派的国家了呢？如果中巴被印度反动派吓倒了，印度反动派又何必叫喊不被吓倒呢？这种胡言乱语，只能表明印度反动派既要威胁中巴，又害怕再吃苦头，这真是何等的做贼心虚。
