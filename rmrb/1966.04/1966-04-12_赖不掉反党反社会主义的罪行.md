　　There has never been a "clean official" in history who could do good things for the people. People want to ask: Then, why does Comrade Wu Han insist on creating an image of a "clean official"? To answer this question, we must first understand what kind of person Comrade Wu Han is. Although Comrade Wu Han is a cadre of considerable rank, for more than ten years since the founding of the country, he has stubbornly clung to his bourgeois worldview and tried to express himself, striving to transform the world with his outlook. Comrade Wu Han's articles and plays such as "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" are expressions of his bourgeois worldview opposing socialism.

　　In a socialist society, there are still serious class struggles. Before the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, when the right-leaning opportunists were rampant in their anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Mocks the Emperor" to cheer for the right-leaning opportunists. Later, the right-leaning opportunists were countered by the Party and the people, and some were dismissed from their posts. At this time, Comrade Wu Han wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" to sympathize with, support, and encourage the right-leaning opportunists to continue their stubborn resistance. How vicious his intentions were!

　　After "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" was criticized, Comrade Wu Han made a "self-criticism." However, it was over ten thousand words long, and it did not touch the essence of the problem at all. If it is called self-criticism, it is better to say that it is a counterattack against those who criticized him. He said that he was very confused and wrote "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" in a muddle-headed way, and he never thought that it would produce such serious consequences. Look, how ridiculously Comrade Wu Han pretended to be stupid! In this "self-criticism," he tried his best to cover up the essential issues, saying that his position was correct and his art was wrong. He wanted to use this "self-criticism" to secretly turn political principled errors into merely academic errors, evade essential issues, turn big things into small things, and turn small things into nothing. However, the facts are the facts after all. Comrade Wu Han's attempt to lightly shrug off responsibility is impossible.

    赖不掉反党反社会主义的罪行
    解放军某部战士　刘居钧
    历史上根本没有能为人民办好事的“清官”。人们要问：那末，吴晗同志为什么偏偏要塑造一个“清官”形象呢？要回答这个问题，就必须弄清吴晗同志是个什么样的人。吴晗同志虽然是一个不小的干部，但是，建国十几年来，他还是抱着他的资产阶级世界观死不放手，总要顽强地表现自己，力图用他的面貌来改造世界。吴晗同志所写的《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》等文章和剧本，就是他的资产阶级世界观反对社会主义的表现。
    在社会主义社会里，还存在着严重的阶级斗争。党的八届八中全会以前，在右倾机会主义分子猖狂地进行反党反社会主义的时候，吴晗同志写了《海瑞骂皇帝》，为右倾机会主义者呐喊助威。后来，右倾机会主义分子遭到党和人民的反击，有的被罢了官。这时，吴晗同志又写了《海瑞罢官》，同情、支持和鼓动右倾机会主义分子继续顽抗。他的用心是何等恶毒！
    《海瑞罢官》受到批评以后，吴晗同志做了一个“自我批评”。但是洋洋万余言，根本没有触及问题的实质。如果说是自我批评，倒不如说是向批评他的人进行反扑。他说自己糊涂得很，稀里糊涂地写出了《海瑞罢官》，根本没想到能会产生这样严重的后果。看，吴晗装傻装到了多么可笑的程度！他在这篇“自我批评”里尽量地掩盖本质问题，说什么立场是正确的，艺术是错误的。他想通过这个“自我批评”，偷偷地把政治原则性的错误变成只是学术性的错误，逃避本质问题，化大为小，化小为无。但是，事实终归是事实，吴晗同志想轻描淡写地推诿责任，这是办不到的。
