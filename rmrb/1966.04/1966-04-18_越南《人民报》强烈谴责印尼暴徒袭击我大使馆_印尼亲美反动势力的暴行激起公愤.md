    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 17th: Vietnam's *People's Daily* published a commentary on April 17th, strongly condemning the barbaric atrocities of the pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia who attacked the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia on April 15th.

    The commentary pointed out that this was a blatant violation of China's sovereignty and a very crude violation of the diplomatic privileges and safety of diplomatic personnel, seriously violating international law and international norms. This incident was directed by the pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia.

    The commentary said that for more than half a year, the pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia have been carrying out a series of activities according to a sinister plan, attempting to completely destroy the normal relations between the People's Republic of China and the Republic of Indonesia, and to damage the long-standing and profound friendship between the people of China and Indonesia. They launched despicable and continuous slanders against China, repeatedly organized thugs to attack China's diplomatic missions in Indonesia, assaulted Chinese diplomats, closed the Xinhua News Agency's branch in Indonesia, closed overseas Chinese schools, looted overseas Chinese property, and disrupted the normal lives of overseas Chinese. The pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia also disregarded all laws and carried out extremely barbaric killings, terror, and threats against overseas Chinese.

    The commentary said that it is clear that the attack on the Chinese Embassy was an extremely blatant and crude action by the pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia, and this action aroused boundless indignation from peace-loving and justice-upholding public opinion in Asia and around the world. The Indonesian government must bear full responsibility for this incident. The commentary said that the Vietnamese people, along with the upright public opinion in Asia and around the world, strongly condemn the pro-American reactionary forces in Indonesia for attacking the Chinese Embassy and warmly support the correct position of the Chinese government.

    越南《人民报》强烈谴责印尼暴徒袭击我大使馆
    印尼亲美反动势力的暴行激起公愤
    新华社河内十七日电　越南《人民报》十七日发表评论，强烈谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动势力十五日袭击中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆的野蛮暴行。
    评论指出，这是明目张胆地侵犯中国的主权、非常粗暴地侵犯外交人员的外交特权和安全的行动，严重地违反了国际法和国际惯例。这一事件是由印度尼西亚亲美反动势力指挥的。
    评论说，半年多来，印度尼西亚亲美反动势力按照阴险的计划进行了一系列活动，妄图彻底破坏中华人民共和国和印度尼西亚共和国之间的正常关系，损害中国和印度尼西亚两国人民之间悠久的深厚友谊。他们对中国发动卑鄙和持续的诬蔑，多次组织暴徒袭击中国驻印度尼西亚的外交代表机关，对中国外交人员行凶，封闭新华社驻印度尼西亚分社，封闭华侨学校，抢劫华侨财产，破坏华侨的正常生活。印度尼西亚亲美反动势力还无视一切法律，对华侨进行十分野蛮的杀害、恐怖和威胁。
    评论说，很明显，袭击中国大使馆的事件，是印度尼西亚亲美反动势力的极端明目张胆和粗暴的行动，这一行动激起亚洲和全世界爱好和平和主持公理的舆论的无比愤慨。印度尼西亚政府必须对这一事件承担全部责任。评论说，越南人民同亚洲和全世界正直舆论一道强烈谴责印度尼西亚亲美反动势力袭击中国大使馆，热烈支持中国政府的正确立场。
