    False Prosperity and Real Difficulties
    Ping Mo

    A few months ago, U.S. monopoly capitalists were ecstatic about the escalation of the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam, which they believed would provide new stimulus to the U.S. economy. For example, *Business Week*, the mouthpiece of Wall Street, wrote in August of last year that "President Johnson's order to increase troops in South Vietnam has improved the economic outlook." *U.S. News & World Report* magazine also quoted a senior official around the same time as saying, "The need to increase arms spending eliminates any doubts that may still exist about the prospects for U.S. business activity."

    However, in just over six months, U.S. bourgeois newspapers have been issuing warnings one after another. *U.S. News & World Report* magazine now says: "Too good, too fast, too dangerous."

    This feeling of both joy and fear on the part of U.S. monopoly capital reflects an irreconcilable contradiction in the current U.S. economy. On the one hand, it relies on ever-increasing military spending to inject a shot in the arm into what *U.S. News & World Report* magazine calls an "aging" economy. On the other hand, the "escalation" of military spending continues to create huge government fiscal deficits and puts strain on the material and labor markets, which creates the risk of runaway inflation.

    The "escalation" of the war of aggression against Vietnam and the resulting large number of military orders have played a certain stimulating role in the resumption of the upward trend in business activity, which had shown signs of slowing down last summer. This effect is most pronounced in the aerospace industry, which is most closely related to the military (and which is the largest sector in manufacturing in terms of the number of people it employs). The U.S. government's billions of dollars in emergency orders have enabled this sector, which was once sluggish at the beginning of last year, to work overtime and use outdated equipment by the end of the year to meet demand.

    According to official estimates, U.S. military orders increased by nearly 14 percent in the second half of last year compared to the first half. The total value of military orders for the year reached as much as $25 billion. Stimulated by military orders, enterprises expanded their already high investment plans, increasing total production investment by nearly $10 billion last year compared to the previous year, reaching a total of $52 billion. Military spending and equipment investment are the two major factors contributing to the abnormal rise in the U.S. economy last year. Although total industrial output increased by 8.2 percent, the rate of increase in military production was 19 percent, and that of corporate equipment was 16 percent.

    The situation in January of this year further demonstrated the characteristics of this development. In that month, new orders for manufactured durable goods increased by about 31 percent compared to December of last year. This was mainly because military orders increased by nearly one-third compared to December, while orders in other areas mostly declined seasonally during the month.

    But while causing this abnormal rise since the second half of last year, it has also created urgent fiscal and economic problems.

    The first is inflation. To reassure the public, Johnson said in his economic report of January 27 that "price stability remains the general rule." And, "Those who claim that inflation has arrived are not seeing all the price situations." But the statistics released by the U.S. Department of Labor immediately slapped him in the face. The wholesale price index, a key indicator of the degree of inflation, rose sharply for two consecutive months in November and December of last year, and then rose again by about 0.5 percent in January and about 0.7 percent in February. Compared to the same period last year, prices at the end of February were up 4.3 percent. In contrast to the stable wholesale prices in the years before 1964, this increase is significant.

    In fact, the trend of new inflation began in mid-1964. In the twenty months since June of that year, the wholesale price index has risen by a total of 5.3 percent. And it rose only 1.1 percent in the seven years from June 1957 to June 1964. In the three months before February of this year, the rate of increase reached 6 percent on an annual basis. And the rate of increase in February was 8.4 percent on an annual basis. This means that the rate of inflation is getting faster and faster. Moreover, this rise includes all major commodities.

    Consumer prices also show the same trend. The steadily rising cost of living index has accelerated since October of last year. The increase in February of this year reached an annual rate of 6 percent. According to the U.S. bourgeoisie themselves, an increase of 3 percent a year is "not acceptable," and an increase of 6 percent would be "severe inflation."

    Now, even Johnson, who is trying to pretend that nothing is happening, has to publicly admit that prices are not only unstable, but are rising "too fast to be comfortable."

    The root cause of inflation is credit expansion. It is no secret that the U.S. economy, with its "excess" productive capacity, has been relying on credit expansion to sustain itself. Encouraged by the authorities' low-interest-rate policies, credit expansion has reached an alarming level. Taking consumer credit as an example, it increased by more than $70 billion last year alone. After deducting repayments, consumer debt increased by a net of $22 billion. The total value of goods and services available for consumption increased by $29.5 billion last year. Comparing the two, the former is more than three-quarters of the latter. This shows the proportion of credit in U.S. economic development. This situation is most prominent in the automotive industry, which is the largest pillar of the U.S. economy. Newly added installment debt for consumers to purchase automobiles accounts for about one-tenth of total annual automobile sales. This huge false purchasing power is an important sign of the weakness of U.S. monopoly capitalism. The massive credit conceals the crisis of production "surplus" and creates temporary superficial prosperity. On this swollen basis, the large increase in military orders and the abnormal expansion of corporate investment have spurred rapid inflation. They put abnormal pressure on the market and promote abnormal demand, such as stockpiling materials and adding equipment in advance to guard against shortages and price increases.

    The abnormal expansion of enterprises is a huge potential crisis factor in the current U.S. economic development. Investment in expanding production temporarily increases market demand. But as capital is transformed into actual production equipment, demand becomes newly added productive capacity. In a situation where the social purchasing power fundamentally lags behind the productive capacity, this further deepens the basic contradiction of production "surplus." Thus, when superficially still in a state of "prosperity," the rate of equipment utilization will begin to decline at some point, and then enterprises will contract production investment, thereby causing a reduction in production.

    Corporate production investment increased by 15.5 percent last year, twice the rate of growth of the entire economy. This trend is still developing this year. According to official survey reports, investment will increase by another 16 percent, while private company surveys indicate that it will increase by another 19 percent. Obviously, it is not possible for the growth of production equipment to exceed the growth of the national economy by such a large margin for a long time. The last time such a large accumulation of capital occurred was in 1956 and 1957. This was followed by a large "surplus" of equipment and a reduction in investment, forming a crisis.

    Johnson boasts that the temporary "prosperity" of the U.S. economy is an "economic miracle" and tries his best to make people believe that U.S. monopoly capitalism can have "new stable and balanced progress." Even the Wall Street tycoons think it is just a "myth." Now Johnson has to treat inflation as the number one problem in the current U.S. economy. His difficulty lies in not being able to decide whether to immediately take measures such as increasing taxes and even wartime price and wage controls to stop the dangerous development of inflation. Taking such unpopular measures would not only be extremely unfavorable to Johnson's Democratic Party in this year's congressional election, but more importantly, once the trend of inflation is reversed, it will cause another series of reactions, leading to a rapid development of the crisis.

    虚假的景气和真实的困难
    苹末
    几个月前，美国垄断资本纷纷为美国侵越战争的升级使美国经济得到新的刺激而得意忘形。例如华尔街的喉舌《商业周刊》在去年八月曾写道：“约翰逊总统下令增兵南越使得经济的前景好转”。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志也在差不多同时引一个高级官员的话说：“增加武器开支的必要，消除了对美国企业活动前景还可能抱有的任何怀疑”。
    可是，为时不过半年，最近美国资产阶级报刊却接二连三地发出警号。《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志现在说的却是：“太好了，太快了，太危险了。”
    美国垄断资本的这种又喜又惧的心情，反映出美国经济当前一个无法解决的矛盾。一方面，它依靠了不断加大的军事开支，来为《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志称之为在“老化”的经济注射强心针。另一方面，军事开支的“升级”继续造成政府财政的巨大赤字，并使物资和劳动力市场出现紧张，从而有使通货膨胀恶性发展的危险。
    侵越战争的“升级”和随之而来的大量军事订货，对于在去年夏天曾有放慢迹象的企业活动恢复上涨，起着一定的刺激作用。这种作用在同军事关系最密切的航空和空间工业（就其雇用的人数说，是制造业中最大的部门）表现得最为明显。美国政府的几十亿美元紧急订货，使得这个在去年年初时曾经生意萧条的部门，到年底时已经需要加班加点，并动用陈旧设备来应付需要了。
    据官方估计，去年下半年美国军事订货比上半年增加近百分之十四。全年军事订货总额达到二百五十亿美元之多。在军事订货的刺激下，企业纷纷扩充本来就高的投资计划，使去年全年生产投资比前年又增加了近百亿美元，总数达到五百二十亿美元。军事开支和设备投资，是造成去年美国经济畸形上升的两大因素。虽然工业总产量增加百分之八点二，但是军火生产增加率是百分之十九，企业设备是百分之十六。
    今年一月的情况进一步表现了这种发展的特点。这个月制造业在耐用品方面的新订货较去年十二月又增加约百分之三十一。这主要是因为军事订货，比十二月增加了将近三分之一，而其他方面的订货在这一个月大部分有季节性的下降。
    但在造成去年下半年以来这种畸形的上升同时，也产生了财政经济方面的紧迫问题。
    首先就是通货膨胀。约翰逊为了安定人心，在他一月二十七日提出的经济报告中还说：“价格稳定仍然是普遍规律”。并说，“那些声称通货膨胀已经到来的人们是没有看到所有的价格情况。”但是美国政府劳工部接着发表的统计数字马上就打了他一个耳光。作为衡量通货膨胀程度的主要指标的批发物价指数，继去年十一、十二两月连续猛升之后，在一月份又上升了约百分之零点五，二月份更上升了约百分之零点七。同一年前相比，二月底时的物价上涨了百分之四点三。同一九六四年以前的几年中间批发价格一直保持稳定的情况相对照，这种上升是很突出的。
    事实上，新的通货膨胀的趋势，从一九六四年中已经开始。从那年六月以来二十个月内，批发物价指数共上升了百分之五点三。而从一九五七年六月到一九六四年六月七年间只上涨百分之一点一。今年二月前的三个月，上涨幅度以年率计算达到百分之六。而二月份的上涨幅度按年率计算为百分之八点四。这就是说：膨胀速度愈来愈快。而且这种涨势包括所有主要商品。
    消费价格也表现了同样趋势。一直在上升的生活费指数从去年十月份起加速上升。今年二月份上升额达到年率百分之六。而按美国资产阶级自己的说法，一年上升百分之三是“不行的”，如果上升百分之六，就是“剧烈的通货膨胀”了。
    现在，连竭力装得若无其事的约翰逊自己也不得不公开承认，物价不但不稳定，而且是涨得“太快而达到令人不舒服的程度。”
    通货膨胀的根本原因是信用膨胀。美国生产力“过剩”的经济一直依靠信用膨胀在维持，这早已不是什么秘密。在当局的低利政策鼓励下，信贷膨胀达到惊人的程度。以消费信贷为例，去年一年共增七百多亿美元，除了偿还数，消费者负债净增二百二十亿美元。去年供消费的货物和劳务共增加二百九十五亿美元。两相比较，前者为后者的四分之三强。由此可以看到信用在美国经济发展中所占的比重。这种情况在作为美国经济最大支柱的汽车业中最为突出。消费者为购置汽车所负的分期付款新增债务约占全年汽车销售额的十分之一。这样巨大的虚假购买力，是美国垄断资本主义虚弱性的重要标志。庞大的信贷掩盖了生产“过剩”危机，制造了暂时的表面繁荣。在这种虚肿的基础上，军事订货的大量增加和企业投资的畸形扩充，促使通货急速膨胀。它们对市场造成畸形的压力，并促进了非正常的需求，例如为防备缺货和涨价而先期囤积物资和添置设备。
    企业的畸形扩充，是当前美国经济发展中一个巨大的潜在危机因素。企业扩大生产的投资，暂时是增加了市场的需求。但随着资金转化为实际的生产设备，需求变成了新添的生产力。在经济根本上已经是社会购买力落后于生产力的情况下，这就进一步加深生产“过剩”的基本矛盾。这样，当表面上还处于“景气”状态的时候，设备利用率将在某一点上开始下降，接着企业将收缩生产投资，从而引起生产的削减。
    去年全年企业生产投资增加了百分之十五点五，为整个经济发展速度的两倍。今年这种趋势仍在发展中。据官方调查报告估计，投资将再增加百分之十六，而私营公司的调查则表明将再增加百分之十九。显然，生产设备超过国民经济发展这样大幅度的增长是不可能持久的。上一次这样大幅度的资本积累是在一九五六至一九五七年。接着就出现了设备的大量“过剩”和投资的削减，形成了一次危机。
    约翰逊把美国经济暂时的“景气”吹嘘成“经济奇迹”，并竭力要使人相信美国垄断资本主义可以有“新的稳定和平衡的进展”。连华尔街的大亨们也认为不过是“神话”。现在约翰逊已不能不把通货膨胀作为美国经济中当前的头号问题处理。他的难处在于无法决定是否马上采取增税以至战时物价、工资管制的办法，来制止通货膨胀的危险发展。采取这种不得人心的办法，不仅在今年国会选举年对约翰逊的民主党极为不利，更关系重大的是，一旦开始倒转通货膨胀的趋势，又会引起另一方面的连续反应，而导致危机的急剧发展。
