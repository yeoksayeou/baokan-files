    Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, April 6th—The Chinese Economic and Trade Exhibition, held in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, has been very popular with the Pakistani public during its three-week run, attracting over 500,000 visitors.
    On the 6th, a large number of visitors came to the exhibition, as it was the last day of the event. Some brought their entire families to visit. Some came specifically to say goodbye to the Chinese staff at the exhibition. The open-air cinema at the exhibition was completely full in the evening.
    Since the exhibition opened on March 15th, visitors have flocked to it, including senior government officials, workers, farmers, business people, students, and housewives. Many people came from Lahore, Rawalpindi, and other cities to visit the exhibition.
    More than 3,000 exhibits made in China, ranging from machine tools, tractors, and radio instruments to aviation gasoline, clothing, grain, blankets, handicrafts, books, and publications, left a deep impression on visitors.
    The Dawn newspaper published an editorial on March 18th, stating that the exhibition "is a microcosm of the tremendous industrial and agricultural progress China has made in the past ten years."
    A visitor named Ghulam Farid wrote in the guestbook: "My visit to the People's Republic of China exhibition has made me truly understand that any nation or country in the world can only achieve development through self-reliance and utilizing its own resources. The people of Asia and Africa are happy for the tremendous progress China has made in such a short period of time."
    Another visitor wrote: "Let the Yankees come and see this exhibition! Asian and African countries can achieve amazing progress by getting rid of the Yankees. China is a living example that proves this point."
    Many people expressed in the guestbook their hope to further strengthen Sino-Pakistani friendship and continue to expand economic cooperation between the two countries. (Attached picture)

    巴基斯坦五十万人民参观我展览会
    观众留言说亚非国家摆脱了美国就可取得惊人进步
    新华社卡拉奇六日电　中国经济和贸易展览会在巴基斯坦最大城市卡拉奇展出的三个星期中，深受巴基斯坦公众欢迎，观众共达五十万人以上。
    六日有大批参观者来到展览会，因为这是展览会展出的最后一天。有些人带了全家来参观。有些人是特地来同展览会的中国工作人员话别的。展览会的露天电影院晚上全部满座。
    自从展览会在三月十五日开幕以来，参观者络绎不绝，其中有政府高级官员、工人、农民、工商界人士、学生和家庭妇女。许多人从拉合尔、拉瓦尔品第和其他城市前来参观展览会。
    从中国制造的机床、拖拉机、无线电仪器、航空用汽油到衣料、谷物、毛毯、手工艺品、书籍和出版物等三千多件展品给参观者留下深刻的印象。
    《黎明报》在三月十八日发表社论说，这个展览会“是中国在过去十几年中所取得的巨大工农业进步的缩影”。
    一位名叫吴拉姆·法里德的参观者在留言簿上写道：“我参观中华人民共和国的展览会使我真正懂得，世界上任何民族或国家只有自力更生和利用自己的资源才能取得发展。亚非人民为中国在这么短的时期里取得的巨大发展而感到高兴。”
    另一位参观者写道：“让美国佬来看看这个展览会吧！亚非国家摆脱了美国佬可以取得惊人的进步。中国是证明了这一点的活生生的实例。”
    许多人在留言簿上表示希望进一步加强中巴友谊，继续扩大两国的经济合作。（附图片）
