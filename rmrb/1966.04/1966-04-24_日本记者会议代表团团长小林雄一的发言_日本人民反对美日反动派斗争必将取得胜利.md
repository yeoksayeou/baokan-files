    Xinhua News Agency, April 23rd -- Yuichi Kobayashi, head of the Japanese Journalists Conference Delegation, at the Fourth Plenary (Enlarged) Meeting of the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association on the 22nd, exposed the U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionists colluding with the Japanese reactionaries, conducting a series of divisive and controlling conspiracies among Japanese journalists. He said that with the control of mass propaganda tools, the reactionaries are attempting to drag the Japanese people into a new world war once again.

    He said that Japanese democratic journalists are determined not to repeat the old mistakes Japan committed during the Pacific War. They are going among the people to participate in the struggle against the revival of Japanese militarism.

    Kobayashi said that after the reactionary Sato government forced the Japanese Diet to ratify the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," it is accelerating its active cooperation with the U.S. imperialist aggression in Vietnam, accelerating the revival of Japanese militarism as the core of an ominous Northeast Asian military alliance. It is busy promoting the benefits of the so-called "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," the significance of the U.S.-Soviet-initiated, planned agreement against nuclear weapons proliferation, and slandering China because it is developing nuclear weapons.

    Kobayashi spoke of the fact that Japan's commercial news organizations are now wholeheartedly serving the interests of the ruling class, which is completely subordinate to U.S. imperialism. This tendency has become more pronounced in Kyodo News and one of Japan's major newspapers, the *Mainichi Shimbun*. These two news enterprises, which have always been wavering, have finally decided to adopt an attitude of supporting government policies after undergoing restructuring. In this way, the system of cooperation between all commercial news organizations and national policy is almost completed. To support this, the government recently appointed a Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary, specially responsible for newspaper work.

    According to Kobayashi, Shintaro Fukushima, who once supported the "U.S.-Japan Security Treaty," was recently elected president of Kyodo News. Fukushima is a professional diplomat. After the war, he was once the Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary of the conservative Ashida government. Fukushima is the main initiator of the planned Asian News Center, which will confront Xinhua News Agency in this region. The *Mainichi Shimbun* is one of Japan's three major newspapers. Because it published Wilfred Burchett's reports on visiting the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, published a series of reports written by its reporter entitled "Muddy and Burning Indochina," and published an article written by its international affairs director Omori in September last year on his observations of the fighting in North Vietnam, it was openly criticized by U.S. Ambassador to Japan Reischauer by name. This caused the newspaper's tendency to change suddenly, openly defending the U.S. aggression against Vietnam and slandering the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Omori left the *Mainichi Shimbun*. The editor who supported Omori was dismissed.

    Kobayashi said that with this control of newspapers by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries, divisive activities have appeared among Japanese journalists. They use organizations controlled by reactionary pro-American journalists, threatening to smash the progressive "Japan Journalists Conference." Another divisive organization is sponsored by right-wing elements within the Socialist Party and the largest national trade union organization, Sohyo, as well as Soviet revisionists. This organization is called the "Organ Newspaper Journalists Federation." It was established in March this year. At the founding ceremony, a representative of Soviet journalists delivered a congratulatory message. The purpose of this federation is to attract a large number of journalists with the lure of "traveling abroad for only 600 yen" to oppose our organization. 600 yen is equivalent to four yuan RMB. This is a typical revisionist tactic.

    Kobayashi said that the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are eager to strengthen their control over mass propaganda tools because they are colluding to attempt to drag the Japanese people into a new world war once again. The Japanese democratic journalists' movement is determined not to repeat the old mistakes we made during the Pacific War. We admit that the situation we face in Japan is quite difficult, but we are optimistic. We are determined to go among the people to participate in their struggles! We are doing our part to help the people's struggles move toward victory by reporting the truth about the developing situation to the fighting people. Although our progress is currently very slow, we are on the right path, and we are confident that we will win.

### 日本记者会议代表团团长小林雄一的发言  日本人民反对美日反动派斗争必将取得胜利

    日本记者会议代表团团长小林雄一的发言
    日本人民反对美日反动派斗争必将取得胜利
    新华社二十三日讯日本记者会议代表团团长小林雄一在二十二日亚非新闻工作者协会书记处第四次全体会议（扩大）上，揭露了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义分子勾结日本反动派，在日本新闻工作者中进行一系列分裂和控制等阴谋活动。他说，随着对大规模宣传工具的控制，反动派正在企图使日本人民再次卷入一次新的世界大战。
    他说，日本民主新闻工作者决心不再重复日本在太平洋战争时期所犯过的老错误。他们正在到人民中间去参加斗争，反对复活日本军国主义。
    小林雄一说，反动的佐藤政府在强使日本国会批准“日韩条约”以后，正在加速对美帝国主义在越南的侵略战争积极进行合作，加速复活日本军国主义，作为不祥的东北亚军事同盟的核心。它正在忙于宣传所谓“日美安全条约”的好处，宣传美苏发起的、计划中的反对核武器扩散的协定的意义，宣传对中国的诽谤，因为它发展核武器。
    小林雄一谈到，日本的商业性新闻机构现在死心塌地地为完全从属美帝国主义的统治阶级的利益服务。这种倾向在共同社和日本一家大报《每日新闻》变得更为显著了。这两个一向是动摇的新闻企业由于进行了改组，终于决定采取支持政府政策的态度，这样，全部商业性新闻机构与国家政策进行合作的体系就差不多完成了。为了支持这一点，政府方面最近任命了一位内阁官房副长官，特别负责报纸工作。
    据小林雄一透露，曾经支持“日美安全条约”的福岛慎太郎最近当选为共同社社长。福岛是一个职业外交家。战后，他一度是保守的芦田政府的官房副长官。福岛是计划中的亚洲新闻中心的主要发起者，这个新闻中心将在这个地区与新华社对抗。《每日新闻》是日本三大报纸之一，由于它刊登了贝却敌关于访问越南南方民族解放阵线情况的报道，刊登了它的记者所写的题为《泥泞的和燃烧的印度支那》的一系列报道，并在去年九月刊登了它的国际部主任大森对战斗的越南北方进行的观察所写的文章，结果，公然遭到美国驻日大使赖肖尔的指名批评。这使得这家报纸的倾向突然改变了，公开为美国侵略越南辩解和诬蔑越南南方民族解放阵线。大森离开了《每日新闻》。支持大森的主编被撤职了。
    小林雄一说，随着美日反动派对报纸的这种控制，在日本新闻工作者中间出现了分裂主义的活动。它们利用反动的亲美新闻工作者所控制的组织，扬言要粉碎进步的“日本记者会议”。另一个分裂主义组织是社会党和全国最大的工会组织总评内的右派分子以及苏联修正主义分子所赞助的。这个组织名叫“机关报新闻工作者联合会”。它在今年三月成立。在成立典礼上苏联新闻工作者的一位代表致了贺词。这个联合会的目的是，用“只要花六百元就可以出国旅行”这种利诱来吸引广大新闻工作者，以同我们的组织作对。六百日元相当于四元人民币。这是典型的修正主义分子的手段。
    小林雄一说，美、日反动派切望加强对大规模宣传工具的控制，其原因：是他们正在勾结，企图使日本人民再次卷入一次新的世界大战。日本民主新闻工作者运动下定决心不重复我们在太平洋战争时期所犯过的老错误。我们承认，我们在日本面临的局面相当困难，可是我们很乐观。我们决心到人民中间去参加他们的斗争！我们在向战斗的人民报道正在发展的局势的真实情况时，尽我们的一分力量使人民的斗争走向胜利。虽然我们目前取得的进展十分缓慢，可是我们在走正确的道路，我们确信，我们将赢得胜利。
