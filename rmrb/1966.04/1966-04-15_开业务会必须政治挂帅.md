    Business Meetings Must Put Politics in Command

    Should business meetings put politics in command? In the past, we weren't very clear on this in our thinking. We always felt that business meetings in commercial departments were nothing more than resolving issues of purchasing, sales, allocation, and storage, and had no political content. Therefore, when holding business meetings, most of our energy was focused on arranging specific tasks, implementing plans, and allocating goods, while neglecting ideological and political work. In this way, although some problems could be solved, they were often not solved thoroughly, and sometimes even some squabbling would occur.

    After studying the experience of the People's Liberation Army in political work, we gained a further understanding that politics is the commander, and political work is the lifeline of all economic work. When we held business meetings again, we paid attention to putting politics first. With this improvement, the situation of the meetings was very different.

    In June of the year before last, we held a provincial fruit conference. The purpose of the conference was to study the fruit purchase work for the summer and autumn seasons, organize exchanges, and arrange for the market. However, we didn't start by talking about purchasing and sales business, but first organized the participants to use the "one divides into two" viewpoint to summarize fruit management work and examine management thinking and management style. We called on everyone to open their minds, speak freely, present the situation, and raise questions. Then, targeting the common ideological problems, we organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's writings and relevant central documents to unify their thinking and understanding.

    In the discussion, everyone discovered that the main problems in past fruit management were the relatively serious purely business viewpoints and localism that existed in both production and sales areas. When the fruit harvest was abundant and the market supply was sufficient, the sales departments often suppressed prices, or even did not properly implement the original contracts. When the fruit harvest was poor and the market supply was relatively tight, the production departments often adopted the method of selling the goods to whoever gave the higher price.

    Through study and discussion, the purely business viewpoint, the purely profit-seeking viewpoint, and localism were criticized, and the participants promoted the spirit of cooperation of serving production, serving consumption, and being jointly responsible for market supply. At the end of the meeting, it only took two days to smoothly solve the business problems and sign production and sales contracts. There were no more instances of haggling and wrangling. That year, the fruit harvest was abundant, and the market supply was large. Thanks to the good cooperation between fruit management units in the production and sales areas, it was possible to pick the fruit in a timely manner, transport it in a timely manner, and maintain reasonable prices. As a result, the income of the production area's communes and teams was increased, and the needs of urban consumers were better met.

    This meeting not only made us, the organizers of the meeting, taste the sweetness of putting politics in command, but the participating comrades also generally reflected that the meeting was well held and had great gains, equivalent to entering a political training class. Later, we also used this method to convene business meetings such as native and sideline product exchange meetings and production materials supply meetings, and the effect was very good.

    From the practice of the past two years, we have realized that putting politics in command truly clears the way for everything. Emphasizing politics in business meetings can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Only by emphasizing politics can business meetings be truly successful.

    开业务会必须政治挂帅
    开业务会要不要政治挂帅？过去我们思想上不大明确。总觉得商业部门的业务会不外是解决购销调存问题，没有什么政治内容。因此，开业务会多半把主要精力放在布置具体任务，落实计划和分配货源上，忽视了思想政治工作。这样，虽然也能解决一些问题，但往往解决得不透，有时候还出现些扯皮的现象。
    学习解放军政治工作经验以后，我们对政治是统帅，政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线有了进一步的认识，再开业务会就注意了把政治摆在第一位。这样一改进，开会的情况就大不相同了。
    前年六月，开全省水果会议。会议的目的是研究夏秋两季的水果收购工作，组织交流，安排市场。可是，我们没有一开头就谈购销业务，而是先组织与会人员用“一分为二”的观点总结水果经营工作，检查经营思想和经营作风。号召大家敞开思想，畅所欲言，摆情况，提问题。然后，针对带普遍性的活思想，组织大家学习毛主席著作和中央有关文件，统一思想认识。
    讨论中，大家发现过去水果经营上的主要问题，是产地和销地都存在着比较严重的单纯业务观点和本位主义。当水果丰收、市场供应充分的时候，销地经营部门往往压等压价，甚至不很好地执行原来的合同；当水果歉收、市场供应比较紧张的时候，产地经营部门往往采取谁给的价钱高就把货给谁的办法。
    通过学习讨论，批判了单纯业务观点、单纯盈利观点和本位主义思想，到会人员发扬了共同为生产、为消费服务，共同对市场供应负责的协作精神。会议最后只用两天时间就顺利地解决了业务问题，签订了产销合同。没有再发生讨价还价、互相扯皮的现象。这一年水果丰收，上市量大。由于产地销地的水果经营单位配合得好，做到了适时采摘，及时外运，并且保持了合理的价格。结果既使产区社队增加了收入，又更好地满足了城市消费者的需要。
    这次会，不仅使我们主持会的人尝到了政治挂帅的甜头，与会同志也普遍反映会议开得好，收获大，等于进了一次政治训练班。后来，我们召开土副产品交流会、生产资料供应会等业务会议，也运用了这种办法，效果都很好。
    从近两年的实践中体会到，政治挂帅，确实一通百通。业务会上突出了政治，就能收到事半功倍的效果。也只有突出政治，业务会才能真正开好。
