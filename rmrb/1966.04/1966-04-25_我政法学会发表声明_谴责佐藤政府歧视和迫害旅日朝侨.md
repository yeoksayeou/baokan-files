    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, the Chinese Political Science and Law Association today issued a statement strongly condemning the Japanese Sato government for colluding with the South Korean Park Chung-hee puppet clique in carrying out international illegal acts of further discriminating against and persecuting Korean citizens residing in Japan.
    The statement of the Chinese Political Science and Law Association said, "The Sato government's conspiracy is a deliberate undermining of internationally recognized legal principles for safeguarding the basic human rights and national rights of overseas Chinese, a trampling on the national democratic rights of Korean residents in Japan, and an insult to their national dignity; this is an extremely barbarous international illegal act.
    "Obviously, this criminal behavior of the Japanese Sato government is a step taken by Japanese militarist forces, with the support of US imperialism, to carry out aggression and expansion abroad and fascist suppression at home; it is also a manifestation of US imperialism piecing together a 'Northeast Asia Military Alliance' to antagonize Asian socialist countries and provoke the Asian people. This cannot but arouse the anger and condemnation of the Korean people, the Japanese people, and the people of Asian countries.
    "Chinese legal workers, together with the Chinese people, resolutely support the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on April 16, resolutely support the just struggle of the Korean people to defend their national democratic rights, resolutely support the heroic struggle of the Japanese people against the Sato government's formulation of the 'School Education Law Amendment Bill'; and solemnly warn the Japanese Sato government to immediately stop the discrimination and persecution of Korean citizens residing in Japan. If the Sato government remains unrepentant and continues to stubbornly follow US imperialism in being hostile to the Asian people, it will inevitably meet with a shameful defeat in the end."

    我政法学会发表声明
    谴责佐藤政府歧视和迫害旅日朝侨
    据新华社二十四日讯　中国政治法律学会今天发表声明，强烈谴责日本佐藤政府勾结南朝鲜朴正熙傀儡集团，对旅日朝鲜公民实行进一步歧视和迫害的国际不法行为。
    中国政治法律学会的声明说，“佐藤政府的这种阴谋活动，是蓄意破坏国际公认的保障侨民基本人权和民族权利的法律准则，是对旅日朝鲜公民民族民主权利的蹂躏，是对他们的民族尊严的侮辱；这是极为野蛮的国际不法行为。
    “显然，日本佐藤政府的这种罪恶行为，是日本军国主义势力在美帝国主义的扶植下，对外实行侵略和扩张，对内实行法西斯镇压的一个步骤；也是美帝国主义拼凑‘东北亚军事同盟’，敌视亚洲社会主义国家、对亚洲人民进行挑衅的一种表现。这不能不引起朝鲜人民、日本人民和亚洲各国人民的愤怒和谴责。
    “中国法律工作者们和中国人民一道，坚决支持朝鲜民主主义人民共和国外务省四月十六日的声明，坚决支持朝鲜人民保卫民族民主权利的正义斗争，坚决支持日本人民反对佐藤政府制定‘学校教育法修改案’的英勇斗争；并且严正地警告日本佐藤政府，立即停止对旅日朝鲜公民的歧视和迫害。如果佐藤政府执迷不悟，继续顽固地追随美帝国主义与亚洲人民为敌，最后必然遭到可耻的失败。”
