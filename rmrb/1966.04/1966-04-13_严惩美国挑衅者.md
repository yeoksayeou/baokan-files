    Severely Punish American Provocateurs
    By People's Daily Commentator
    Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force has again reported good news: on the afternoon of the 12th, it shot down an invading American heavy attack aircraft over the Leizhou Peninsula area of Guangdong Province. This battle was fought excellently, once again demonstrating the powerful strength of our Air Force. We warmly celebrate this major victory and extend our highest respect and cordial greetings to the Air Force units who performed meritorious service in this battle!
    Recently, while expanding its war of aggression against Vietnam, American imperialism has increasingly and rampantly carried out military provocations against our country. American aerial bandits have continuously attacked our fishing boats and merchant ships on the high seas, killing and injuring 17 of our fishermen on April 7, and menacing our merchant ships with dive-bombing on the 10th. On the 12th, an American heavy attack aircraft brazenly disregarded our warnings and intruded deep into our airspace. This deliberate provocation shows that American imperialism is intensifying its policy of hostility towards the Chinese people, thoroughly exposing the Johnson administration's so-called willingness to "improve" Sino-American relations as nothing but lies.
    American imperialism should understand that the Chinese people are by no means to be trifled with. We are fully prepared for any provocation by American imperialism. As long as you dare to come, we will resolutely fight; whenever you come, we will fight, without any mercy. The new victory of our Air Force in safeguarding sovereignty is another severe punishment for the American aggressors and another powerful warning to American imperialism.
    American imperialism is incorrigible and will not learn a lesson. The Air Force units, shouldering the responsibility of defending the motherland's airspace, must continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, give prominence to politics, guard against arrogance and rashness, increase vigilance a hundredfold, and stand ready to resolutely strike any invading enemy.

    严惩美国挑衅者
    本报评论员
    我英勇的人民解放军空军部队，又传捷报，十二日下午在广东省雷州半岛地区上空击落入侵的美国重型攻击机一架。这一仗打得十分出色，又一次显示了我国空军的强大威力。我们热烈庆祝这一重大胜利，谨向在这一战斗中立功的空军部队，致以崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问！
    最近，美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，对我国的军事挑衅日益频繁和猖獗。美国空中强盗不断在公海上袭击我国的渔船、商船，四月七日打死打伤我国渔民十七人，十日又对我国商船进行俯冲威胁。十二日，美国重型攻击机竟然不顾我方警告，深入我国领空。这种蓄意挑衅，表明美帝国主义正在加紧推行它的敌视中国人民的政策，彻底揭穿了约翰逊政府所谓愿意“改善”中美关系的鬼话。
    美帝国主义应该懂得，中国人民决不是好惹的。对于美帝国主义的任何挑衅，我们都已作好了准备。只要你敢来，我们就坚决打；你什么时候来，我们就什么时候打，决不留情。我空军部队维护主权取得的新胜利，是对美国侵略者的又一次严厉的惩罚，也是对美帝国主义又一次有力的警告。
    美帝国主义本性难移，是不会接受教训的。肩负着保卫祖国领空的空军部队，要继续高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，突出政治，戒骄戒躁，百倍提高警惕，随时给予来犯之敌以坚决的打击。
