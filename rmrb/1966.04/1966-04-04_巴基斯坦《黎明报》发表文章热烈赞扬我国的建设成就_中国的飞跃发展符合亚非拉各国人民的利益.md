    Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, 3rd dispatch: Pakistan's "Dawn" newspaper recently published an article written by Isphahani entitled "Welcome Chairman Liu Shaoqi," warmly praising the achievements made in China's socialist construction.
    The article said: "Regardless of what some countries hostile to China say, China's industrial, educational, and economic development is astonishing. China has transformed from a backward agricultural country into an increasingly industrialized country capable of producing products that can withstand international scrutiny. Its agriculture has also experienced a rapid development."
    The article pointed out: "Furthermore, it is worth noting that China today has no foreign debt. It purchases materials from abroad using its own financial resources." The article said: "Paying attention to this fact is in the best interests of the developing countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America."
    The article said that such progress was only possible under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong.
    The article said, "When India was preparing to partition us in September 1965 during this distressing and difficult time, the Chinese government and people supported us so resolutely." The article also said: "Only China assured us that no matter what happens, no matter what the cost, it would not abandon us." "On the other hand, our so-called Western friends, with whom we have been allied for many years, only obstructed everywhere, shouted empty slogans, hypocritically expressed hope that the subcontinent could regain its senses, refused to name the aggressor, and refused to deal with the aggressor with integrity."
    The article emphasized: "The only major country that unreservedly supports the right of self-determination for five million Kashmiris is China. This has now become a historical fact."
    The article pointed out: "We are very grateful for China's sincere friendship and hope and wish that the friendship and understanding that we have developed in recent years will be increasingly strengthened."

    巴基斯坦《黎明报》发表文章热烈赞扬我国的建设成就
    中国的飞跃发展符合亚非拉各国人民的利益
    新华社拉瓦尔品第三日电　巴基斯坦《黎明报》最近发表署名伊斯巴哈尼所写的一篇题为《欢迎刘少奇主席》的文章，热烈赞扬中国社会主义建设所取得的成就。
    文章说：“不管有些敌视中国的国家怎么说，中国的工业、教育和经济的发展是惊人的。中国已经从一个落后的农业国变为能够生产经得起国际检验的产品的日益工业化的国家。它的农业也有了飞跃的发展。”
    文章指出：“此外还值得注意的是，中国今天没有外债。它是以自己的财源从国外购买物资的。”文章说：“去注意这一事实，是符合亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲发展中的国家的最大利益的。”
    文章说，只有在毛泽东主席的领导下这种进展才有可能。
    文章说，“当印度在一九六五年九月准备分割我们的这一苦恼和困难的时刻，中国政府和人民是那么毅然决然地支持我们。”文章还说：“只有中国向我们保证：不论发生什么事情，不管要付出什么代价，它都不会抛弃我们”。“另一方面，我们与之联合了多年的所谓西方朋友，只是到处阻挠，空喊一阵，虚伪地表示希望次大陆能恢复理智，拒绝指名谁是侵略者，拒绝以正直的态度去对付侵略者。”
    文章强调指出：“毫无保留地支持五百万克什米尔人自决权利的唯一大国是中国。这一点现在已成为一个历史事实。”
    文章指出：“我们十分感谢中国的真诚友谊，并且希望和祝愿我们近年来发展的友谊和了解将日益加强。”
