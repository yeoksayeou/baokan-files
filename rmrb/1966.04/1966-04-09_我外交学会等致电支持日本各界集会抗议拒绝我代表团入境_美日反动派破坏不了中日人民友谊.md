    Xinhua News Agency, April 8th—The Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and the China-Japan Friendship Association today sent telegrams to the Japanese Socialist Party and the Japan-China Friendship Association, expressing firm support for the national assembly of more than one hundred Japanese friendly parties and organizations to be held in Tokyo on the 9th to protest the refusal of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs delegation to enter Japan.
    In its telegram to the Japanese Socialist Party, the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs extended high respect and heartfelt thanks to the Japanese friends attending the meeting. The telegram said: "The Sato government, disregarding the strong wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people, has brazenly refused the entry of the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs, which is an extremely serious step by the Sato government to deliberately undermine friendly exchanges between the people of China and Japan. It serves the aggressive and war policies of U.S. imperialism and is yet another great exposure of its reactionary face in following U.S. imperialism's hostility towards the Chinese people.
    "This reactionary measure of the Sato government has not only aroused great indignation among the Chinese people, but also aroused strong protests and condemnations from the broad masses of the Japanese people. We express our support for the just struggle of your party and people from all walks of life in Japan to continue to realize the visit of the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs and to strengthen and develop the friendship between the people of China and Japan.
    "The desire of the people of China and Japan to be friendly from generation to generation is an irresistible historical trend. Any conspiracy by U.S. imperialism and Japanese reactionaries to obstruct and undermine the friendship between the people of China and Japan is absolutely doomed to fail. We firmly believe that the just struggle of the Japanese people will ultimately achieve final victory."
    The telegram from the China-Japan Friendship Association said: "Since the Sato government came to power, in order to adapt to the needs of U.S. imperialism to further expand its war of aggression against Vietnam and intensify the encirclement and 'containment' of China in its counter-revolutionary strategy, it has gone further and further down the road of anti-China. This time, the crude refusal of the delegation of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign Affairs to enter Japan is not an isolated event. This cannot but arouse serious vigilance and great indignation among the people of China and Japan.
    "The 650 million Chinese people cherish the friendship with the Japanese people very much. More than 95% of the Japanese people also eagerly hope to live in harmony with China, and they attach great importance to enhancing friendship with each other through friendly exchanges. A handful of reactionary forces in Japan who follow U.S. imperialism, are hostile to China, and undermine the normal exchanges between the people of China and Japan are contrary to the wishes of the broad masses of the Japanese people. However, the future of Sino-Japanese friendship is determined by the nearly 800 million people of China and Japan. We firmly believe that the people of China and Japan, united, will surely smash all the conspiracies of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to undermine the friendship between the people of China and Japan, and hold even higher the banner of Sino-Japanese friendship and move forward!"

    我外交学会等致电支持日本各界集会抗议拒绝我代表团入境
    美日反动派破坏不了中日人民友谊
    新华社八日讯　中国人民外交学会和中国日本友好协会今天分别打电报给日本社会党和日本中国友好协会，对日本一百多个友好政党、团体九日将于东京举行抗议拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境的国民大会表示坚决支持。
    中国人民外交学会在致日本社会党的电报中向出席集会的日本朋友们表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。电报说：“佐藤政府不顾日本广大人民的强烈愿望，悍然拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境，这是佐藤政府蓄意破坏中日两国人民友好往来的极其严重的步骤，是为美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策服务的，是追随美帝国主义敌视中国人民的反动面目的又一次大暴露。
    “佐藤政府的这一反动措施，不仅激起了中国人民的极大愤慨，而且激起了日本广大人民的强烈抗议和谴责。我们对于贵党和日本各界人民继续为实现中国人民外交学会代表团访日，为加强和发展中日两国人民的友谊而进行的正义斗争，表示支持。
    “中日两国人民要世世代代友好下去的愿望是不可抗拒的历史潮流。美帝国主义和日本反动派企图阻挡和破坏中日两国人民友谊的任何阴谋都是绝对不能得逞的。我们坚信，日本人民的正义斗争终将取得最后胜利。”
    中日友协的电报说：“佐藤政府上台以来，为了适应美帝国主义进一步扩大侵越战争，加紧包围和‘遏制’中国的反革命战略的需要，在反华的道路上越走越远。这次粗暴地拒绝中国人民外交学会代表团入境，并不是孤立的事件。这不能不引起中日两国人民的严重警惕和极大的愤慨。
    “六亿五千万中国人民十分珍视同日本人民的友谊。百分之九十五以上的日本人民也迫切愿望同中国友好相处，他们十分重视通过友好往来增进彼此之间的友谊。日本一小撮追随美帝国主义的反动势力，敌视中国，破坏中日两国人民间的正常往来，是违背日本广大人民的愿望的。但是，决定中日友好前途的，是近八亿的中日两国人民。我们坚信，中日两国人民团结起来，定能粉碎美日反动派破坏中日人民友谊的一切阴谋，更高地举起中日友好大旗向前迈进！”
