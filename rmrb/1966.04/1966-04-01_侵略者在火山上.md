    Invaders on a Volcano
    In recent days, the anti-American demonstrations by the people of major South Vietnamese cities such as Saigon, Da Nang, and Hue have rapidly developed and reached a climax. The intervention and suppression by the US military have ignited the anger of the demonstrating masses. They demanded that Johnson publicly apologize within forty-eight hours for the US military's interference in South Vietnam's internal affairs. The development of the situation to such a serious point has plunged the US-puppet clique into a predicament, filled with panic and unease.
    Saigon is the center of the US-puppet clique's rule, Da Nang is an important base for the American invading forces, and Hue is also a major city in South Vietnam. The eruption of such large-scale anti-American demonstrations in places so tightly controlled by the US-puppet clique, with the spearhead of the struggle directly pointing at the American invaders and their running dogs, shows that everywhere beneath the feet of the American invaders are volcanoes that could erupt at any moment.
    US imperialism wants to turn South Vietnam into its colony, which puts itself in opposition to the fourteen million people of South Vietnam. The people of South Vietnam have an irreconcilable hatred for the American invaders. The longer the American invaders stay in South Vietnam, the greater the hatred the South Vietnamese people have for them. The Johnson administration's attempt to engage in so-called "social reforms" political deception in South Vietnam to "win hearts and minds" is completely self-deception. Johnson has long understood that whether in the liberated areas or in the enemy-occupied areas, the "hearts and minds" of South Vietnam are set on driving the American invaders out of their homeland. The roars echoing through cities like Saigon in recent days are a severe warning to the Johnson administration.
    The anti-American demonstrations by the people in the enemy-occupied areas of South Vietnam once again demonstrate that wherever the claws of US imperialism extend, the people there will eventually rise up and sever them. Whether the US uses suppression or deception, it cannot resolve the contradictions between it and the South Vietnamese people. Today, the anti-American sentiment of the South Vietnamese people is getting higher and higher, and the anti-American anger is burning more and more fiercely. Their anti-American anger echoes the flames of battle of the South Vietnamese people's armed forces, causing the American invaders to suffer not only a disastrous defeat militarily, but also a disastrous defeat politically, and will eventually be buried in the sea of fire in South Vietnam.

    侵略者在火山上
    最近几天，西贡、岘港和顺化等南越主要城市人民的反美大示威，迅速发展，达到高潮。美军的干涉和镇压，使示威群众怒火高燃。他们要求约翰逊在四十八小时内对美军干涉南越内政的行为公开道歉。事态发展到如此严重的地步，已使美伪集团陷入困境，惊慌不安。
    西贡是美伪集团统治的中心，岘港是美国侵略军的重要基地，顺化也是南越的主要城市。象这样一些为美伪集团严密控制的地方，都爆发了如此大规模的反美示威，斗争的矛头直接指向美国侵略者及其走狗，可见美国侵略者的脚下到处是随时都可能爆发的火山。
    美帝国主义要把南越变成它的殖民地，这就使自己处于同一千四百万南越人民对立的地位。南越人民同美国侵略者之间有着不共戴天之仇。美国侵略者在南越多呆一天南越人民对它的仇恨就增加一分。约翰逊政府企图在南越搞所谓“社会改革”的政治欺骗来“争取民心”，这完全是自欺欺人。约翰逊早就明白，不论在解放区也好，或者在敌占区也好，南越的“民心”，都是要把美国侵略者赶出他们的国土。近几天来响彻西贡等城市的怒吼声，就是对约翰逊政府的严厉警告。
    南越敌占区人民的反美大示威再一次说明，美帝国主义的魔爪伸到哪里，哪里的人民终于要起来斩断它的魔爪。美帝不论用镇压的一手也好，用欺骗的一手也好，都无法解决它同南越人民之间的矛盾。今天，南越人民的反美情绪越来越高涨，反美的怒火也越烧越猛烈。他们的反美怒火同南越人民武装的战斗之火，彼此呼应，使美国侵略者不仅在军事上遭到惨败，而且在政治上也遭到惨败，最后一定要被埋葬在南越的火海之中。
