    According to Xinhua News Agency, April 24th, since the beginning of this year, the rumble of anti-American thunder has continued to echo across the Latin American continent.

    In addition to the vigorous anti-American patriotic struggle of the Dominican people, which is continuing to develop in depth, the struggle of the Ecuadorian people has entered a new peak this year, and on March 29th, it shattered the Castro-Hijón military dictatorship, which was fostered by the United States. From the very beginning of the struggle, the Ecuadorian people put forward the clear slogan of "Down with the mastermind - US imperialism!" American diplomatic and cultural aggression institutions in the three major cities of Quito, Guayaquil, and Cuenca have been attacked or burned multiple times by angry masses. This anti-American, anti-dictatorial storm lasted for more than two months, and people from almost all major cities and broad strata of the ten provinces were involved in the torrent of struggle.

    In January of this year, the Panamanian people once again launched large-scale demonstrations demanding the return of the Canal Zone forcibly occupied by the United States. In the capital, Panama City, tens of thousands of people took to the streets, demanding that the American imperialists get out of Panama.

    In more than a dozen Latin American countries from Mexico to Argentina, anti-American demonstrations have also occurred since the beginning of this year, and angry masses have attacked American embassies and other American aggression institutions. In Brazil, under the dark rule of the pro-American dictatorship, on the eve of the second anniversary of the reactionary coup, students in cities such as São Paulo held anti-American and anti-dictatorial demonstrations amid cries of "Down with the Dictatorship." The American consulate was bombed three times. The head of US imperialism is increasingly becoming a "stinking rat" that everyone shouts at in Latin America. Recently, when Johnson visited Mexico, wherever he went, people constantly shouted slogans such as "We don't want murderers here!"

    Closely combining the support of the Vietnamese people's struggle with the anti-American patriotic struggle of their own country is one of the outstanding characteristics of the anti-imperialist struggle of the Latin American people this year. During this period, anti-American demonstrations and marches in support of the Vietnamese people's struggle have erupted in more than a dozen countries. The Dominican people, standing on the front line against the United States, put forward the militant slogan "Dominica and Vietnam unite and will surely win!" In the large-scale anti-American demonstration held at the beginning of the year to demand the return of sovereignty over the Canal Zone, the Panamanian people also expressed their firm support for the just struggle of the Vietnamese people. Puerto Rican youth have repeatedly held large-scale marches and rallies to oppose the American war of aggression against Vietnam and to express their firm maintenance of national sovereignty. Patriots in the Argentine capital bravely planted the flag of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front on the American embassy building. In Mexico, in addition to thousands of people demonstrating in the capital, farmers in remote areas of Tamaulipas also held marches protesting the American aggression against Vietnam and angrily burned a Sam Uncle puppet symbolizing American aggressors.

    This year, in the struggle to safeguard living rights and oppose economic plunder, the Latin American people have also directed their spearhead primarily at the US monopoly capital groups, the root cause of poverty and backwardness. This struggle is particularly fierce and prominent in Chile. Nearly 10,000 miners at the US-owned Teniente copper mine persisted in an 88-day strike from January 4th to the end of March, forcing the American company to meet some of the workers' demands and losing more than 100 million pounds of copper ore. Hundreds of thousands of workers across the country were involved in a wave of sympathy strikes. In Argentina, 800,000 workers in various industries have held strikes since the beginning of the year. Fifteen hundred workers at an American-owned company in Rosario took the heroic action of occupying the enterprise. In Ecuador, workers and people of all strata in many US-owned enterprises held many strikes, marches, and issued statements protesting the American plundering of forest and other national resources and demanding improved living conditions, powerfully cooperating with this year's anti-American and anti-dictatorial struggle. In Colombia, America's ubiquitous plunder has been resolutely opposed by local residents. More than 10,000 residents of Chocó Province held demonstrations protesting against American companies plundering local gold mining resources.

    拉丁美洲人民同多米尼加人民站在一条战线上
    今年以来不断示威游行罢工反对美帝国主义及其走狗反动统治
    据新华社二十四日讯　今年年初以来，拉丁美洲大陆上继续响起了隆隆的反美春雷。
    除了多米尼加人民轰轰烈烈的反美爱国斗争正在继续深入发展之外，厄瓜多尔人民的斗争今年以来又进入了一个新的高峰，并且在三月二十九日冲垮了美国一手扶植起来的卡斯特罗·希洪军事独裁政权。斗争一开始，厄瓜多尔人民就提出了“打倒主谋犯——美帝国主义！”的明确口号。美国在基多、瓜亚基尔和昆卡三大城市的外交和文化侵略机构多次被愤怒的群众袭击或焚烧。这次的反美、反独裁风暴整整坚持了两个多月，全国几乎所有大城市和十个省的广泛阶层的人民都卷入了斗争洪流。
    巴拿马人民在今年一月间再一次开展了要求收回美国强占的运河区的大规模示威运动。在首都巴拿马城，数万群众浩浩荡荡走上街头，要求美国佬滚出巴拿马。
    从墨西哥到阿根廷的十几个拉丁美洲国家中，今年年初以来也都发生了反美示威，愤怒的群众袭击了美国使馆和其它美国侵略机构。在亲美独裁政权黑暗统治下的巴西，在反动政变两周年前夕，圣保罗等城市的学生在“打倒独裁”的呼声中举行了反美反独裁示威。美国领事馆挨了三次炸。美帝国主义的头目在拉丁美洲越来越成为人人喊打的“过街老鼠”。最近约翰逊访问墨西哥时，他所到之处，都有人不断高呼“这里不要杀人犯！”等口号。
    把支援越南人民的斗争和本国的反美爱国斗争紧密结合起来，是今年以来拉丁美洲各国人民反帝斗争的突出特点之一。在这期间，已有十几个国家爆发了声援越南人民斗争的反美示威游行。屹立在反美前线的多米尼加人民在斗争中提出了“多米尼加和越南联合起来必定胜利！”的战斗口号。巴拿马人民在年初举行的要求收回运河区主权的反美大示威中，也表示坚决支持越南人民的正义斗争。波多黎各青年多次举行声势浩大的游行和集会，反对美国的侵越战争和表示坚决维护民族主权。阿根廷首都的爱国者勇敢地把越南南方民族解放阵线的旗帜高高地插在美国使馆大楼上。在墨西哥，除了首都数千人举行示威外，塔毛利帕州偏僻地区的农民也举行抗议美国侵略越南的游行，并且愤怒地烧毁了象征美国侵略者的山姆大叔傀儡象。
    拉丁美洲人民今年以来在进行维护生活权利和反对经济掠夺的斗争中，也把锋芒首先指向贫困和落后的祸根美国垄断资本集团。这一斗争在智利特别激烈和突出。美资经营的特尼恩特铜矿近万名矿工从今年一月四日到三月底坚持了八十八天罢工斗争，迫使美国公司满足了工人的部分要求并损失了一亿多磅铜矿石。全国几十万职工卷入了同情罢工的浪潮。在阿根廷，年初以来，各行各业八十万职工举行了罢工。罗萨里奥城一家美资公司一千五百名职工采取了占领企业的英勇行动。厄瓜多尔不少美资经营企业的工人和各阶层人民分别举行了许多次罢工、游行和发表声明抗议美国掠夺森林等民族资源和要求改善生活条件，有力地配合了今年的反美反独裁斗争。在哥伦比亚，美国无孔不入的掠夺遭到当地居民的坚决反对。乔科省一万多居民曾举行示威游行，反对美国公司掠夺当地的金矿资源。
