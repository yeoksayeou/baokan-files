    (Xinhua News Agency, April 7th) The youth of the capital held a rally tonight to welcome the delegation from the Japanese Socialist Youth League.

    Qian Dawei, Vice Chairman of the All-China Youth Federation, and Hajime Fukada, Chairman of the Japanese Socialist Youth League, both spoke at the meeting.

    Qian Dawei said at the meeting that the first Sino-Japanese Youth Friendship Festival greatly developed the fighting friendship between the youth of the two countries in the struggle against our common enemy, U.S. imperialism.

    Qian Dawei said that the new Soviet leaders have betrayed the interests of the people of the world, pursued a line of Soviet-U.S. cooperation to dominate the world, actively cooperated with U.S. imperialism's counter-revolutionary "global strategy," and intensified their collusion with the Japanese reactionaries, drawing in Japanese militarist forces to form an encirclement against socialist China. This is the greatest betrayal of world revolution and the people of all countries.

    Hajime Fukada said at the meeting that Japanese imperialism and the Sato Cabinet have become an important part of the imperialist alliance headed by U.S. imperialism in the international arena. They are pursuing a policy of following the United States, concluding the aggressive "Japan-South Korea Treaty," adopting a hostile policy towards China, and playing a central role in the Asian anti-communist alliance.

    Hajime Fukada said that the friendship and unity between the youth of our two countries is a powerful weapon in our struggle against our common enemy. Regardless of any obstruction or suppression we encounter, we will strengthen our solidarity and make the second Japan-China Youth Friendship Festival a success.

    首都青年集会欢迎日本青年代表团
    中日青年加强团结共同反美
    据新华社七日讯　首都青年今天晚上举行集会，欢迎日本社会主义青年同盟代表团。
    全国青联副主席钱大卫和日本社会主义青年同盟委员长深田肇都在会上讲了话。
    钱大卫在会上谈到，第一届中日青年友好大联欢，大大地发展了两国青年在反对共同敌人美帝国主义斗争中的战斗友谊。
    钱大卫说，苏联新领导背叛了世界人民的利益，奉行着苏美合作主宰世界的路线，积极配合美帝国主义的反革命“全球战略”，加紧同日本反动派勾结，拉上日本军国主义势力组成一个对社会主义中国的包围圈。这是对世界革命和各国人民的最大背叛。
    深田肇在会上说，日本帝国主义、佐藤内阁在国际上已成为以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义同盟的重要的一部分。他们实行追随美国的政策，缔结了侵略性的“日韩条约”，采取敌视中国的政策，起着亚洲反共同盟的中心的作用。
    深田肇说，两国青年的友好和团结，是我们同共同敌人斗争的强有力的武器。不管遇到什么样的阻挠和镇压，我们都将加强团结，使第二届日中青年大联欢获得成功。
