    The Indonesian reactionaries' intimidation and attacks on the Kingdom of Cambodia regarding the meeting of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Journalists' Association have aroused the righteous indignation of the Cambodian people. Prince Sihanouk has expressed the solemn position of the Cambodian government and people in not being coerced by the Indonesian reactionaries, and Cambodian public opinion has criticized the unreasonable behavior of the Indonesian reactionary generals' clique in rudely interfering in Cambodia's internal affairs. The Cambodian government and people have demonstrated an awe-inspiring and inviolable spirit, severely striking at the arrogance of the Indonesian reactionaries.
    After completing the coup d'état plan to seize state power, the Indonesian right-wing generals' clique has increasingly exposed its reactionary face of being anti-communist and anti-people domestically, and following imperialism externally. Since the Indonesian right-wing reactionary forces have sold themselves to American imperialism, they must take the likes and dislikes of American imperialism as their own, so it is not surprising that they take a hostile attitude towards all independent countries that adhere to the anti-imperialist stance. This is how they treat China, and it is impossible for them not to treat Cambodia in the same way.
    However, the Indonesian reactionaries have misjudged their target. The Cambodian people are a people with ambition, a sense of justice, and national pride. American imperialism, with its bared fangs and brandished claws, has not been able to scare them, so how much ability does this clownish Indonesian reactionary faction have? Prince Sihanouk said it well: "We are not afraid of the superpowers—the United States—that possess atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs," so the threat from Indonesia "will also be unlikely to make a deep impression on us." The Indonesian reactionaries struck a pose to scare people, but the result was a resounding slap in the face.

    柬埔寨人民不怕威胁
    印度尼西亚反动派在亚非新闻工作者协会书记处开会问题上对柬埔寨王国进行恫吓和攻击，激起了柬埔寨人民理所当然的愤慨。西哈努克亲王表明了柬埔寨政府和人民不受印度尼西亚反动分子要挟的严正立场，柬埔寨舆论纷纷抨击印度尼西亚反动将领集团粗暴干涉柬埔寨内政的无理行径。柬埔寨政府和人民表现出凛然不可侵犯的气概，严厉打击了印度尼西亚反动派的气焰。
    印度尼西亚右派将领集团在完成夺取国家政权的政变计划后，越来越暴露出它对内反共、反人民，对外追随帝国主义的反动面目。印度尼西亚右派反动势力既然卖身投靠美帝国主义，就必然要以美帝国主义喜恶为自己的喜恶，因此它对一切坚持反帝立场的独立国家，采取敌视的态度，是毫不奇怪的。它对中国是这样，对柬埔寨也不可能不是这样。
    但是，印度尼西亚反动派是看错对象了。柬埔寨人民是有志气、有正义感、有民族自豪感的人民，美帝国主义张牙舞爪也没有能把他们吓倒，那末印度尼西亚反动派这个跳梁小丑又有多大能耐呢？西哈努克亲王说得好：“我们不怕拥有原子弹、氢弹的超级大国——美国”，那么，印度尼西亚的威胁“也将不可能给我们深刻的印象。”印度尼西亚反动派装腔作势想吓唬人，结果却是得到一记响亮的耳光。
