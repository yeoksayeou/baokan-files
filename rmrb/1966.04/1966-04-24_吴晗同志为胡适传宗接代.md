Edition: 5

    During the period of socialist construction, sharp and complex class struggles still exist. Domestic and foreign class enemies place their hopes on our country's younger generation, spreading their poison and expanding their influence in every possible way among young people, "breeding" and "selecting seedlings" to find successors for them. Comrade Wu Han, as Hu Shih's "prized disciple," did not neglect this important aspect when he "broke away from the school" and launched a major attack on the Party and socialism. On the one hand, he continuously tossed out poisonous weeds such as "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office"; on the other hand, he, wearing the guise of a "Marxist historian," "old leftist," and "old senior," engaged in various activities, trying his best to poison the younger generation, attempting to make our youth deviate from the path directed by the Party and Comrade Mao Zedong and turn them into Hu Shih's "disciples and grandsons." Our broad masses of youth must thoroughly expose Comrade Wu Han's malicious conspiracy and resolutely become communist successors.
        Guiding young people to pursue fame and fortune, clinging to books and taking the path of "individual struggle"
    We will not forget that Comrade Wu Han, who often expressed a sense of "loneliness" before 1959, suddenly became a "busy man" after 1959. Busy with what? First, he was busy writing articles, launching frenzied attacks on the Party and socialism; to write "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," he spared no effort, revising the draft seven times. Second, he was busy giving reports and lectures, poisoning young people. In recent years, he traveled tirelessly, entering and exiting universities, giving reports and lectures, and meeting with reporters everywhere, publishing talks. Third, he was busy publishing books. In 1961, he published "Spring Collection," and just a year later, "Learning Collection" was released. At the time, he was quite complacent about his "prolificness," saying that writing these things "was not very hard, on the contrary, very happy." His complacency was evident on paper. Thus, Hu Shih's goods in disguise were released in large quantities.
    What exactly did Wu Han instill in our young people? In his articles, what he talked about most with young people was that they should not care about major domestic and international events, that they should not be guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, that they should not participate in the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, but rather called on young people to bury themselves in books, to bury themselves in historical materials, to bury themselves in the stacks of old paper.
    Comrade Wu Han often put on the airs of an "authority," answering questions and offering "advice" to young people. Let's look at his "answers" and "advice."
    How to learn history? He said: "There are only two words in the answer: reading."
    What is the method of learning? The answer is: "Three diligences" – "diligently read, diligently copy, diligently write," to "browse frequently," "remember firmly," "read basic books thoroughly and specifically; read books outside the basics more and broadly."
    How to write articles? The answer is: "Three mores" – "read more, write more, revise more," "First of all, read more," so that you can become a "master" of writing articles.
    How should history and theory be arranged? The answer is: "Learn history first, then learn theory."
    What is the most lacking in intellectuals? The answer is: "Not enough books read," "poverty of knowledge," "research work has not entered the door." "This is the crux of the problem."
    What is the path of learning? The answer is only "one": "Learn from people who have this knowledge (note, that is, from "authorities" like Comrade Wu Han), learn from books that have this knowledge."
    In order not to wrong Comrade Wu Han, we must point out that Comrade Wu Han did not forget to "teach" our young people to "relate to reality" and to "practice," but how to "relate"? Comrade Wu Han told us: "After learning mathematics, after understanding a formula, you must perform calculations," "do more exercises"; "learn physics and chemistry, do multiple experiments in the laboratory," this is the "process of the unity of theory and practice."
    Look, this is the "way of reading" that Comrade Wu Han has proposed to our young people.
    Comrade Wu Han was not satisfied with issuing verbal declarations. He understood that if young people were to follow him, there must also be a living "model." In Comrade Wu Han's view, the readily available model was Hu Shih. But this person had long been thrown into the trash heap of history by the Chinese people, and bringing him out again would inevitably spoil the scenery and make people hold their noses. The ideal figure was still Comrade Wu Han himself. On the one hand, he was a specimen carefully cultivated by Hu Shih, getting Hu Shih's true teachings; on the other hand, he also had the charming guise of an "old leftist" and "Marxist historian." Thus, Comrade Wu Han personally took the stage. In 1961, he recommended "I Overcame the 'Supra-Class' Viewpoint" to our young people. In 1962, he talked freely to reporters from the Beijing Daily about the secrets of individual struggle. Before and after this, he also disseminated his personal struggle history more than once in speeches at many universities.
    What exactly are the secrets of individual struggle disseminated by Comrade Wu Han? In summary, it is: starting from the purpose of becoming famous and establishing oneself and "personal interests," "burrowing into the vast pile of historical materials," grasping the clues that can lead to fame and establishment, "seeking the roots and pursuing to the end," "putting in hard work," writing monographs and papers, and obtaining the appreciation and cultivation of "authorities" and "experts," so that you can become famous in one fell swoop. He summarized his personal struggle experience and came to the conclusion: "Anyone can become an expert and scholar, the key lies in whether you work hard yourself." That is to say, individual struggle is his fundamental secret to becoming famous and establishing himself.
    The set of ideas that Comrade Wu Han propagated is not something new; Hu Shih had already said these things decades ago. As early as more than fifty years ago, when the Chinese people rose up to oppose the Twenty-One Demands, the traitorous treaty signed by Yuan Shikai, Hu Shih published a "Public Letter to Students Studying Abroad" in 1915, proposing that "our responsibility is to study," to prevent students studying abroad from participating in patriotic political movements. When the Chinese revolution was flourishing, he called on young people to "sit alone in the library," saying that "the turmoil of the country and the external stimuli should only increase your enthusiasm and interest in studying, and should not tempt you to shout with everyone," because reading is "ten times, a hundred times more important than shouting." He also wrote a special article "How to Read Books," promoting that "learning should be like the Egyptian tower, to be broad and high," requiring students to "read all books," "not to let go of a single stroke of a Chinese character." At that time, his purpose was to drive those students who took saving the country as their own responsibility back to the classroom, to engage in the trick of "sorting out the national heritage," to resist the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people. Now our Party and Chairman Mao call on young people to study history for the revolution, to study for the revolution, but Comrade Wu Han wants our young people to study history for the sake of becoming famous and establishing themselves. Chairman Mao calls on historical research to serve the needs of the revolution, but Comrade Wu Han calls for studying history from "interest." Chairman Mao calls on comrades engaged in social sciences to go to the practice of the three great revolutionary movements, to combine with workers and peasants, to roll around in the mud, but Comrade Wu Han wants to pull our young people back to the stacks of old paper. According to Comrade Wu Han's method, only useless bookworms and philistines can be cultivated, turning them into captives of the bourgeoisie and revisionism.
    Inciting young people to oppose the political movements led by the Party, enticing young people to follow him in stirring up trouble
    Among the large number of articles by Comrade Wu Han on reading and studying, two are particularly worthy of our attention. One is called "Everyone Should Make Up Lessons," and the other is called "On Waves," both selected into the "Learning Collection." These are two poisonous arrows shot directly at the Party, with malicious intentions and great deceptiveness and incitement towards young intellectuals.
    In the former article, Comrade Wu Han put forward a call to "fill the blank period." What is the "blank period"? According to Comrade Wu Han, in recent years, "young teachers are very nervous, most of them have been teaching since liberation and have participated in many political activities," "but many young teachers have not read enough books," "they are stepping up their studies, and they cannot help but reveal an anxious mood, this mood is completely understandable, should be sympathized with and must be given full support." Then, he talked about himself, "From 1937 to 1949, I was not able to systematically read books or do research work," "Since the founding of the country, in the past twelve years, I have been educated to a greater or lesser extent through a series of political movements," "However, I am afraid that not everyone can seriously and systematically read books and do research work," so he had a "sense of blankness," he wanted everyone to make up lessons to "fill the blank period."
    Look! How much Comrade Wu Han cares about and understands young people! He not only completely "understands" the mood of young people, but also "must fully" support their demands, he is simply "speaking for the people." But what exactly is the "blank" that Comrade Wu Han is talking about? The meaning is very clear, that is, to tell our young people: you have read too few books, your knowledge is too poor, "not old, not specialized, and not established." What is the reason? It is the political movements led by the Party that have hindered you from becoming famous and establishing yourselves. The problem is very obvious, Comrade Wu Han's purpose is to try to use the so-called "blank period" to incite young people's dissatisfaction and aversion to political movements, and to entice them to rise up to struggle against the Party. What to fill the "blank"? It is not difficult to find the answer. Comrade Wu Han said that after 1937, he did not read books well, it goes without saying that only before 1937 was his golden age of reading, and that time happened to be the era when Comrade Wu Han studied under Hu Shih and his ilk. So that's how it is! The so-called "make-up lessons" is to have us return to the 1930s and make up the lesson that Comrade Wu Han learned from Hu Shih. Comrade Wu Han pretends to "care about young people," but in the end, this is nothing more than "crocodile tears," who can be deceived?
    Our young people need to make up lessons. But the lessons that our young intellectuals lack most are not the things that Comrade Wu Han said. The political movements since liberation, especially the major struggles in the ideological field: such as the struggle to criticize the film "The Life of Wu Xun," the criticism of the study of "Dream of the Red Chamber," the struggle to criticize Hu Shih and Hu Feng, the struggle against the revisionist ideas of Yang Xianzhen and Feng Ding, and other struggles on the literary and art front, did not create a "blank period," but used proletarian ideas to "fill" the "blank" of these positions. The problem is that we have not "filled" these positions enough, so that positions such as history are still occupied by bourgeois "authorities" like Comrade Wu Han. The "blank" must be "filled" by our proletariat. There is also a "blank" on the bodies of our young generation, but it is not that fewer books have been read, but precisely that many books have been read, but they have not been read correctly, from books to books, from concepts to concepts, the more you read, the dumber you become. What we lack most is the class struggle lesson, the production struggle lesson, and the lesson of combining with the workers and peasants. This "blank" must be "filled." What we need to make up is precisely what Comrade Wu Han thinks should be opposed. "Thousands of sails pass by the capsized boat, ten thousand trees bloom in front of the diseased tree," what Comrade Wu Han appreciates is precisely the "capsized boat" and the "diseased tree," but he wants to recommend these things to young people and ask us to take them as "tonics," we will never be fooled.
    "On Waves" can be said to be the sister article of the previous one. Since liberation, our country has always been in a period of revolution, revolutionary waves, one after another, are vast and mighty, ruthlessly scouring the mud and dirty water of the bourgeoisie, Wu Han is not interested in this at all. He can't see anything else, but in 1962, he suddenly discovered a "wave of reading, a wave of diligent study, a wave of seeking knowledge." When we were launching a struggle against bourgeois ideas in the academic world, he did not call it a good situation, but in 1961, when Comrade Wu Han launched a major attack on the Party and a large number of demons and monsters emerged in the academic and artistic circles, he cheered: "This is a great situation in the academic and cultural circles."
    Comrade Wu Han cheered for the "wave of reading, the wave of diligent study, the wave of seeking knowledge," and cheered for the "great situation in the academic and cultural circles," with ulterior political motives. He accurately saw the opportunity for right-leaning opportunists and other counter-revolutionary elements to make a big noise about "reversing verdicts" and the "going-it-alone trend," and also wanted to launch a pincer attack on the cultural and academic front, echoing each other, and setting off a reactionary counter-current to break down the dike of the great revolution in education, the dike of the great revolution in the ideological field, and the Party's strong leadership over these fields, thereby shaking the foundation of the socialist edifice. He specifically came to young people to talk about this issue, because he wanted to break through a gap from here. Unfortunately, the so-called "wave" cheered by Comrade Wu Han is only a counter-current in the Yangtze River. Comrade Wu Han wants to entice the young people of New China to follow him in stirring up trouble, and it can only be a pipe dream.
    Calling on teenagers to learn the "virtues" of the ancients, guiding them to take the anti-Party and anti-socialist road
    Since liberation, the vast number of young people in our country have worked hard to study Chairman Mao's works and resolutely followed the Party. Heroic figures such as Lei Feng, Wang Jie, Ouyang Hai, and Mai Xiande have emerged among them, and the vast number of young people have taken them as examples to learn from. However, Comrade Wu Han did not approve of this situation. He put forward a call to our young people to "learn the excellent virtues of the ancients" and inherit feudal morality. He used all convenient conditions to promote and shout loudly everywhere. His tentacles not only extended to universities, but also to middle school students and elementary school students. In recent years, Comrade Wu Han, under the banner of popularizing historical knowledge, used the convenience of his editorship of the Chinese History Small Series to try to turn this small series into his position for disseminating reactionary ideas. He himself personally wrote "The Story of Hai Rui" for this series, and directly recommended his reactionary ideas to our young people in the form of popular reading materials.
    This was not enough for him, he also wanted to pass on his reactionary ideas to our younger generation. In 1962, he became interested in children's books again. In this year, he wrote several articles specifically for children, one called "Writing for Young Authors" and the other called "Talking about Historical Stories." In the former article, he directly called on young children to "become famous and establish themselves." Saying that "to know how to become a 'house,' it is absolutely impossible to rely on one article," "this is just a good start," "must continue to pay hard work." In the latter article, he "stipulated" the "principles" for compiling children's books. What are the "beneficial" reading materials for children? Answer: To be able to "learn wisdom, courage, diligence, tenacity, invention, and other virtues from them; learn vocabulary, spelling, and composition from them; absorb knowledge from them," In another place, he further elaborated on the "virtues" that young children should learn, which are: 1. "Not afraid of the powerful, dare to fight against bad people and bad things," 2. "Disregard private feelings, wholeheartedly do a good job," 3. "Resourceful, brave, have courage, use your brains," 4. "Diligent and studious." We educate children to have a clear class point of view, to love Chairman Mao, love socialism, and the Communist Party, to study for the revolution. Wu Han is tight-lipped about all this, not mentioning a word, but talking about abstract courage, resourcefulness, and diligence. Why is this? Is it not exactly similar to what "Hai Rui Scolds the Emperor" and "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office" want to tell people? As long as we see clearly the political purpose of "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," then what he said to the children is not difficult to see clearly. Wu Han is precisely using a concealed method to instill anti-Party poison into children. It is precisely here that his intentions are so sinister. However, although the method is "clever," it is impossible to escape the eyes of the Chinese people.
    In the sharp and complex class struggle, Comrade Wu Han has given us another vivid lesson and acted as our negative teacher. The facts tell us that the enemy will not sleep, they not only enthusiastically and directly attack the socialist system, but also spare no effort to work on the next generation. From these facts, we have further realized the great significance of strengthening the education of young people in Mao Zedong Thought and carrying out the education revolution. In addition, we must not underestimate the influence spread by Comrade Wu Han, and it is necessary to systematically criticize and disinfect the things he spread among young people, and resolutely repel his attack on us in this field.

    吴晗同志为胡适传宗接代	徐非光　劳鸿起
    在社会主义建设时期，仍然存在着尖锐复杂的阶级斗争。国内外的阶级敌人，把希望寄托在我国的青年一代身上，千方百计地在青年当中散布他们的毒素，扩大他们的影响，“育种”、“选苗”，为他们寻找继承人。作为胡适的“得意门生”的吴晗同志，当他“破门而出”向党向社会主义大举进攻的时候，也没有忽略这个重要的方面。他一面连续抛出《海瑞骂皇帝》、《海瑞罢官》等毒草；一面披着“马克思主义史学家”、“老左派”、“老前辈”的外衣，从事多种活动，极力毒害青年一代，企图要我们的青年，离开党和毛泽东同志指示的道路，变成胡适的“徒子徒孙”。我们广大青年，必须彻底揭露吴晗同志的恶毒阴谋，坚决做共产主义接班人。
        引导青年追逐名利，死抠书本走“个人奋斗”的道路
    我们不会忘记，一九五九年之前经常流露出“寂寞”之感的吴晗同志，一九五九年后，却突然变成了“大忙人”。忙什么？首先是忙于写文章，向党和社会主义猖狂进攻；为了写《海瑞罢官》，他不惜“七易其稿”，可谓不遗余力。其次，则是忙于报告，讲课，对青年放毒。几年来他风尘仆仆，出入高等学校，又是做报告，又是讲课，并到处接见记者，发表谈话。再次，就是忙于出书。一九六一年出了一本《春天集》，隔了刚刚一年，《学习集》又出笼了。当时他对自己的“多产”是颇有点踌躇满志的，说他写这些东西“不怎样苦，相反很高兴”。得意忘形，跃然纸上。于是经过伪装的胡适的货色，便大量放了出来。
    吴晗到底向我们的青年灌输了些什么货色？在他的文章中对青年谈得最多的，就是要青年不要关心什么国内外大事，不要马列主义、毛泽东思想指导，不要参加三大革命运动的实践，而是号召青年钻到书本中去，钻到史料中去，钻到故纸堆里去。
    吴晗同志经常摆着“权威”的架子，给青年解答问题，提出“忠告”。且看他的“答案”和“忠告”。
    怎样学历史？他说：“答案只有两个字：读书”。
    学习的方法是什么？答案是：“三勤”——“勤读、勤抄、勤写”，要“时时翻阅”“记得牢靠”“打基础的书要读得熟，读得专；基础外的书要读得多，读得广”。
    怎样写文章？答案是：“三多”——“多读书、多写作、多修改”，“首先是，多读书”，这样就可以成为写文章的“妙手”。
    史和论怎么摆法？答案是：“先学历史，后学理论。”
    知识分子最缺乏的是什么？答案是：“书读的不够”，“知识贫乏”，“研究工作没有入门”。“这是问题的症结”。
    学习的途径是什么？答案也只有“一条”，“向有这门知识的人学（按，即向吴晗同志这样的“权威”学），向有这门知识的书本学”。
    为了不冤枉吴晗同志，我们必须指出，吴晗同志并没有忘记“教导”我们的青年要“联系实际”，要“实践”，但是怎样“联系”法呢？吴晗同志告诉我们：“学了数学，在懂得一个公式之后，就必须加以演算”，“多做习题”；“学物理、化学，要在实验室作多次试验”，这就是“理论和实践统一的过程”。
    请看，这就是吴晗同志向我们青年提出的“读书之道”。
    吴晗同志并不以发布口头的宣言为满足。他懂得，要青年跟着他走，还必须有一个活“样板”。在吴晗同志看来，现成的样板是胡适。但是此人早已被中国人民丢进了历史的垃圾堆，再拿出来不免大煞风景、招人掩鼻。理想的人物还是吴晗同志自己。一方面他是胡适精心培养的标本，得到胡适的真传；另一方面他又有“老左派”、“马列主义史学家”的迷人外衣。于是吴晗同志亲自出场了。一九六一年他把《我克服了“超阶级”观点》推荐给我们的青年。一九六二年又对北京日报的记者，纵谈个人奋斗的秘诀。在这前后，他在不少高等学校的讲话中，也不只一次地散布了自己的个人奋斗史。
    吴晗同志散布的个人奋斗的秘诀到底是些什么呢？归结起来，就是：从成名成家的目的和“个人的兴趣”出发，“钻到浩瀚的史料堆中去”，抓住可以成名成家的线索，“寻根究底”、“跟踪追击”，“下苦功夫”，写出专著论文，得到“权威”、“专家”的赏识和栽培，就可以一举成名。他总结自己个人奋斗的经验，得出的结论是：“任何一个人都可以成为专家学者，问题的关键就在于自己是否努力”。这就是说个人奋斗，就是他成名成家的根本秘诀。
    吴晗同志宣传的这一套，并不是什么新鲜的东西，这些东西胡适在几十年前早就讲过了。早在五十多年前，当中国人民奋起反对袁世凯签订的卖国契约二十一条时，胡适就在一九一五年发表过“致留学生公函”，提出“我们的职责是学习”，阻止留学生参加爱国政治运动。当中国革命蓬勃发展时，他又号召青年，要“独坐图书馆”，说什么“国家的纷扰、外间的刺激，只应增加你求学的热心与兴趣，而不应该引诱你跟着大家去呐喊”，因为读书“比呐喊重要十倍、百倍”。他还专门写了一篇“怎样读书”的文章，宣传什么“为学要如埃及塔，要能博大要能高”，要学生“什么书都读”“中国字的一点一撇都不可放过”。当时他的目的就是把那些以救国为己任的学生赶回课堂，搞什么“整理国故”的名堂，来对抗中国人民的革命斗争。现在我们党和毛主席号召青年，要为革命而研究历史，为革命学习，吴晗同志却要我们的青年为成名成家而研究历史。毛主席号召历史研究要服从革命的需要，吴晗同志却号召从“兴趣”出发而研究历史。毛主席号召搞社会科学的同志，到三大革命运动的实践中去，和工农相结合，滚出一身泥巴，吴晗同志却要把我们的青年拉回到故纸堆里。按照吴晗同志的办法，只能培养出一些无用的书呆子和市侩，变成资产阶级和修正主义的俘虏。
    煽动青年反对党所领导的政治运动诱骗青年跟着他一道兴风作浪
    在吴晗同志大量的谈读书和学习的文章中，有两篇特别值得我们重视。一篇叫《大家都要补课》，一篇叫做《说浪》，都选入了《学习集》。这是直接对党放出的两支毒箭，用意险恶，对青年知识分子具有很大的迷惑性和煽动性。
    在前一篇文章中，吴晗同志提出了一个“填平空白时期”的号召。什么是“空白时期”？根据吴晗同志的说法，近年来“青年教师们很紧张，他（她）们大多数是解放后任教的，参加了很多政治活动”，“但是许多青年教师书读得不够多”，“他们一面在加紧学习，一面也不免流露出焦急的心情，这种心情是完全可以理解的，应该同情并且一定要全力地给以支持的。”接着，他又谈到了他自己，“从一九三七年到一九四九年这一期间，就没有能够系统地读过书，做过研究工作”，“建国以后，这十二年以来，通过一系列的政治运动，或多或少受到了教育”，“但是，认真有系统地读书和做研究工作，怕也不是每一个人都能做到的吧”，于是他有了“空白之感”，他要大家补课，来“填平空白时期”。
    看呀！吴晗同志多么关心和体贴青年！他不仅完全“理解”青年的心情，而且“一定要全力地”支持他们的要求，他简直是在“为民请命”了。但是，吴晗同志所说的“空白”，究竟是什么呢？意思很清楚，就是告诉我们青年：你们书读得太少了，知识太贫乏了，“一不老，二未专，三还不成家”。原因是什么？就是党所领导的政治运动，阻碍了你们成名成家。问题很明显，吴晗同志的目的是企图以所谓“空白时期”，煽动青年们对政治运动的不满和厌恶，诱骗他们起来向党进行斗争。填什么“空白”呢？这也不难找到答案。吴晗同志说，一九三七年以后，没有好好地读书，不言而喻，只有一九三七年以前才是他读书的黄金时代，而那个时候恰恰是吴晗同志拜在胡适之流门下受教的时代。原来如此！所谓“补课”，就是要我们回到三十年代去，补吴晗同志向胡适学习的那一课。吴晗同志装出“关心青年”的样子，说穿了，这不过是“鳄鱼的眼泪”，能骗了什么人呢？
    我们的青年是需要补课的。但是我们知识青年最缺的课，并不是吴晗同志说的那些东西。解放以来的历次政治运动，特别是意识形态领域内的几次大斗争：如批判电影《武训传》的斗争，红楼梦研究的批判，批判胡适胡风的斗争，对于杨献珍、冯定的修正主义思想的斗争，以及文艺战线上的其他斗争，不是造成了什么“空白时期”，而是用无产阶级的思想“填平”了这些阵地的“空白”，问题在于这些阵地我们还“填”得不够，以至象历史学这样的阵地，至今还在象吴晗同志这样的资产阶级“权威”手中霸占着，这个“空白”，我们无产阶级一定要去“填平”。我们青年一代的身上也存在着“空白”，但并不是什么书读少了，恰恰是书读得不少，而读得不对头，从书本到书本，从概念到概念，越读越蠢。我们最缺乏的正是阶级斗争的课，生产斗争的课，和工农群众结合的课，这个“空白”是非“填平”不可的。我们要补的，恰恰是吴晗同志认为要反掉的东西。“沉舟侧畔千帆过，病树前头万木春”，吴晗同志欣赏的正是“沉舟”和“病树”，他却要把这些东西推荐给青年，并要我们当做“补药”来吃，我们决不上当。
    《说浪》，可以说是前一篇的姊妹篇。解放以来，我们国家一直处在革命的时期，革命的浪，一个接一个，浩浩荡荡，无情地涤荡着资产阶级的污泥浊水，吴晗对这个是一概不感兴趣的。他别的看不见，到一九六二年，他忽然发现了一个“读书的浪，勤学的浪，求知的浪”。当我们在向学术界的资产阶级思想开展斗争时，他不叫大好形势，可是在一九六一年，吴晗同志大举向党进攻，学术、艺术界牛鬼蛇神大量出笼的时候，他欢呼了：“这是学术文化界的大好形势”。
    吴晗同志欢呼“读书的浪，勤学的浪，求知的浪”，欢呼“学术文化界的大好形势”，有其不可告人的政治目的。他看准了社会上右倾机会主义和其他反革命分子大闹“翻案风”、“单干风”的时机，也想在文化学术战线来一个里应外合，互相呼应，掀起一个反动的逆流，来冲垮教育大革命的堤防，冲垮意识形态领域大革命的堤防，冲垮共产党对这些领域的坚强领导，从而动摇社会主义大厦的根基。他特别向青年来讲这个问题，则是想从这里突开一个缺口。可惜的是，吴晗同志所欢呼的所谓“浪”，只不过是长江大河中的一股逆流，吴晗同志想引诱新中国的青年跟着他一块兴风作浪，也只能是白昼作梦。
    号召青少年学习古人的“美德”，引导他们走反党反社会主义道路
    解放以来，我国广大青年努力学习毛主席著作，坚决跟着党走，他们中间出现了象雷锋、王杰、欧阳海、麦贤得这样的英雄人物，广大青年把他们当做自己学习的榜样。可是吴晗同志对这种情况却大不以为然。他向我们青年提出了“向古人学习优良美德”，继承封建道德的号召。他利用一切便利条件到处宣传、大声疾呼。他的触角不仅遍及高等学校，而且伸到中学生和小学生那里去了。这些年来吴晗同志打着普及历史知识的旗号，利用他主编中国历史小丛书的便利条件，企图把这个小丛书当成他散布反动思想的阵地。他自己则亲自为这套丛书写了《海瑞的故事》，把自己的反动思想，用通俗读物的形式，直接推荐给我们的青年。
    这还嫌不够，他还要把它的反动思想传给我们更年青的一代。一九六二年，他又对儿童读物感到兴趣了。就在这一年，他连续针对着少年儿童写了好几篇文章，一篇叫《写给少年作者》，另一篇叫《谈历史故事》。在前一篇文章中，他直接号召少年儿童“成名成家”。说什么“要知道成一个‘家’，光靠一篇文章是绝对不行的”，“这只是一个良好的开端”“必须继续付出辛勤的劳动”。在后一篇文章中，他“规定”了编写儿童读物的“原则”。什么是对儿童“有益”的读物？答：要能“从中学取智慧、勇敢、勤劳、顽强不屈、发明创造等美德；从中学取造词、缀字、作文；从中吸取知识”，在另一个地方他又把要少年儿童学取的“美德”，作了进一步发挥，这就是：一、“不畏强暴，敢于同坏人坏事斗争”，二、“不顾私情，一心一意做好工作”，三、“机智勇敢，有胆量，动脑筋”，四、“勤勉好学”。我们教育少年要有鲜明的阶级观点，要热爱毛主席，热爱社会主义和共产党，要为革命而读书，吴晗对于这一切，讳莫如深，只字不提，而是大谈其抽象的勇敢，机智，勤学，这是为什么？吴晗同志这里要向少年儿童散布的东西，不是恰恰和《海瑞骂皇帝》《海瑞罢官》要告诉人们的东西非常类似吗？只要看清了《海瑞罢官》的政治目的，那么他对少年儿童所说的话，也就不难看得一清二楚了。吴晗正是利用了一种隐讳的方式，向少年儿童灌输反党的毒素。他的居心之险恶，也正是在这里。但是，方法虽然“巧妙”，却不可能逃过中国人民的眼睛。
    在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，吴晗同志又给我们上了生动的一课，充当了我们的反面教员。事实告诉我们，敌人是不会睡觉的，他们不仅热心地直接向社会主义制度进攻，而且还不遗余力地在下一代的身上用功夫。从这些事实中，使我们进一步认识到加强对青年进行毛泽东思想的教育和进行教育革命的伟大意义。此外，我们也不能低估吴晗同志所散布的影响，有必要对他在青年中散布的东西，进行系统的批判和消毒工作，坚决打退他在这个领域内对我们的进攻。
