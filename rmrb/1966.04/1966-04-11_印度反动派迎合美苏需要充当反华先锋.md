    The Indian reactionaries, in order to beg for "aid" from the U.S. and the Soviet Union to cope with severe domestic and international difficulties, have been touting U.S.-India and Soviet-India collusion, issuing anti-China cries, attacking Sino-Pakistani friendship, and acting as a liaison for U.S.-Soviet collusion on the Vietnam issue during Mrs. Gandhi's recent trips to Washington and Moscow. All this has received the "appreciation" of the Johnson administration and the Soviet leaders, demonstrating the sinister intentions of the U.S., the Soviet Union, and India to collude against China and against the people of Asia, and exposing that the Indian reactionaries have degenerated to become the humble slaves of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.
    Xinhua News Agency, April 10th: Our correspondent reports: Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has only been in office for two months, and she hurriedly made a trip to Washington and Moscow in late March and early April.
    Her visit was conducted under the following circumstances: Internationally, the Johnson administration, while actively preparing to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, is stepping up its efforts to plan an anti-communist, anti-China alliance in Asia to surround and contain China. The Soviet revisionist leading group is using the convening of the 23rd Congress of the CPSU to launch a new anti-China wave. Domestically in India, the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, the food crisis is unprecedentedly severe, the people are living in misery, and the political situation is turbulent. The Indian Prime Minister's visit to the U.S. and the Soviet Union at such a time, and her massive attacks on China, are precisely to cater to the anti-China needs of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leading group, so that she can beg for more "aid" from these two "big benefactors" to cope with the severe domestic and international difficulties, and to divert the attention of the Indian people.
    Mrs. Gandhi inherited the mantle of her father, Nehru, and actively pursued the pro-U.S., pro-Soviet, and anti-China line he had established during this visit. In the United States, she praised Johnson as a "man with lofty ideals" and a "great president," and as India's "lofty" friend. She said that her talks with Johnson brought "the United States and India closer together." She even took pride in India's selling out to U.S. imperialism, saying that "India is as important to the United States as the United States is to India," and that neither can do without the other. On the other hand, she attacked China repeatedly, and the tone became higher each time. She rehashed the old tune of China's so-called "threat" and "aggression" against India, slandering that China does not want peace in the Indian subcontinent, saying that China is interested in "as much turmoil and instability as possible" there, and so on. This Indian Prime Minister finally completely discarded the tattered cloak of "non-alignment" and shouted entirely in the American tone: "The threat of Communist China's expansion must be contained not only by military means, but also by political and economic means." Disregarding India's predicament of being mired in domestic and foreign difficulties and finding it difficult to even make ends meet, she even wanted to act as the vanguard of the United States' anti-China policy, shouting that India is "fighting against Chinese communism."
    Johnson was very satisfied with the Indian Prime Minister's performance. He told Indian diplomatic officials that he had received the heads of government of twenty-one countries so far, and that "this U.S.-India meeting was the most satisfactory." Rusk also said that this was "the beginning of a new chapter" in U.S.-India relations. During Mrs. Gandhi's visit to the U.S., Johnson, in addition to announcing that he would allocate $300 million to establish an "Indo-U.S. Foundation," also asked Congress to agree to "urgently" ship another 3.5 million tons of grain to India, along with the 6.5 million tons of grain and other agricultural and livestock products previously promised, worth about $1 billion. This shows that India's dependence on the United States has reached the point where it cannot extricate itself. A commentary issued by the Indian Press Trust on April 4th from New Delhi expressed India's heartfelt satisfaction with the rewards from its American master. The commentary said: Mrs. Gandhi's "assessment of China's threat to Asia, and the explanation she gave of India's commitment to helping contain it, seem to have deeply impressed President Johnson, who immediately announced that his country was prepared to help India's economic development through international efforts."
    American and Indian newspapers do not shy away from saying that the intensified collusion between the U.S. and India is out of a common anti-China need. The American magazine *The New Republic* pointed out clearly in an article on the eve of the talks: India "is now facing the biggest crisis since independence and urgently needs the United States to help it solve this crisis"; and for the United States, "India is an important anti-communist country to compete with Red China. Some people imagine that India will join hands with Japan and other Asian countries to thwart the Chinese conspiracy." "The important question now is: Is Washington prepared to use huge sums of money to support India's competition?" The subsequent facts showed that the Johnson administration indeed paid a "huge sum" to buy India's "competition" against China.
    *The Hindustan Times* also expressed "optimism" in advance about the outcome of this trip in a report before Mrs. Gandhi set off for the United States. The report said: "Promoting this optimistic estimate is the further understanding of common political interests arising from the recent diplomatic exchanges between the United States and India. This is mostly centered on the two countries' common attitude towards China." The newspaper also said, "It is said that Johnson recognizes the need to strengthen India's defense against China" and "believes that an Indo-Pakistan agreement is the best defense against China."
    Mrs. Gandhi's loud anti-China cries before, during, and after her visit to the U.S. were equally appreciated by the Soviet leaders. The Soviet Union gave this Indian Prime Minister an extremely warm and friendly reception. Kosygin held several talks with her in a "warm and friendly atmosphere" during her short two-day stay in Moscow, praising her as "a symbol of the close ties of friendship between India and the Soviet Union." Both sides also touted the "Indo-Soviet friendship" established by Nehru and Khrushchev in their common anti-China stance. Kosygin and Mrs. Gandhi both expressed their intention to continue to strengthen "Indo-Soviet friendship" in order to jointly oppose China. Although the Soviet Union itself is not having an easy time and has not specifically stated that it will provide food to help solve India's current serious difficulties in food, according to Mrs. Gandhi's announcement to reporters in Moscow, the Soviet Union promised "to consider (assistance) to this issue based on India's fourth five-year plan (starting this year)."
    During this visit to the U.S. and the Soviet Union, Mrs. Gandhi, on the one hand, catered to the needs of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to jointly oppose China and isolate China, and on the other hand, attacked Pakistan for "violating" the "Tashkent Declaration," a product of U.S.-Soviet collusion, out of the need to implement India's expansionist policy, and tried to undermine the friendly relations between Pakistan and China. In New York, she attacked Pakistan's just demand for a plebiscite in Kashmir as "undermining (India's) country," saying that "it is too late to talk about a plebiscite now." In order to gain the support of the United States, Mrs. Gandhi said that "Kashmir is extremely important for India's defense against China in Ladakh." She raised the issue of "the development of Pakistani-Chinese friendship" with Johnson and also "expressed unease" about Pakistani-Chinese friendship during talks with Kosygin.
    Mrs. Gandhi's anti-China, anti-Pakistan, and attempts to undermine Sino-Pakistani friendship tactics exactly suited the wishes of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Mrs. Gandhi proudly announced in the Indian Parliament on the 7th that the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union "were quite uneasy about Pakistan's recent provocative remarks." She confirmed that the Soviet Union had decided to send an "envoy" to Pakistan to discuss this matter. She also said that Johnson expressed his full understanding of "the danger of Pakistan's increasing friendship with China." The United News of India reported that "the Soviet Union expressed to the Pakistani government its concern about certain anti-Indian speeches made by Pakistani leaders recently." "Moscow told Rawalpindi that these speeches violated the spirit of Tashkent." The news agency revealed that Moscow had made "admonitions" to Pakistan. *The Times of India* more bluntly stated that Sino-Pakistani friendship "not only makes the United States annoyed, but also makes the Soviet Union, which is trying to contain Beijing's influence, annoyed," and "Russia's response to Pakistan's acting willfully is as intense as that of the United States." Pakistan's *Construction News* pinpointed the reason why the U.S. and the Soviet Union are so hostile to Sino-Pakistani friendship. The newspaper published an article on the 4th saying that "the Soviet current leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism is an attempt to contain China's rapidly developing strength and political influence."
    During this trip, the Indian Prime Minister also acted as a liaison between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on the Vietnam issue, actively planning a new "Munich" conspiracy. During her visit to the U.S., Mrs. Gandhi discussed the Vietnam issue with Johnson. On the one hand, she publicly expressed "understanding" of the United States' predicament in South Vietnam, saying that the United States "hopes for peace," while attacking the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for refusing to "compromise." She advocated convening a Geneva conference to "peacefully resolve" the Vietnam issue. In the Soviet Union, she also focused on discussing the Vietnam issue with Soviet Premier Kosygin. What she discussed with Kosygin was kept secret by both sides. However, Mrs. Gandhi revealed in the Indian Parliament on April 7th after returning home that she had planned with the heads of state of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to convene "a meeting based on the Geneva Accords" as an exchange for peddling the "peace talks" fraud on the Vietnam issue. She said with pride that Johnson and Kosygin "both appreciated" India's position on the Vietnam issue.
    The Indian Prime Minister's trip to the U.S. and the Soviet Union has once again exposed to the world the evil intentions of U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leading group, and the Indian reactionaries colluding together to oppose China and the people of other Asian countries, and has also further exposed that the Indian reactionaries have degenerated to become humble slaves of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism.
    Imperialism and all reactionaries always want to do things that harm others and benefit themselves. However, in the end, they always lift a stone only to drop it on their own feet.

    印度反动派迎合美苏需要充当反华先锋
    甘地夫人为了向美苏乞求“援助”应付国内外的严重困难，在最近的华盛顿和莫斯科之行中，鼓吹美印、苏印勾结，发出反华叫嚣，攻击中巴友好，并且为美苏在越南问题上的勾结充当联络员。这一切，得到了约翰逊政府和苏联领导人的“赞赏”，表明美苏印相互勾结反对中国和反对亚洲人民的罪恶意图，并且暴露出印度反动派已经堕落到成为美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的卑顺奴才的地步。
    新华社十日讯　本社记者报道：印度总理英迪拉·甘地夫人上台才两个月，就在三月底和四月初匆匆跑了一趟华盛顿和莫斯科。
    她这次出访，是在这样一种情势下进行的：在国际上，约翰逊政府在积极准备进一步扩大侵越战争的同时，加紧策划亚洲反共、反华联盟，包围和遏制中国；苏联修正主义领导集团正利用苏共二十三次代表大会的召开，掀起一次新的反华浪潮。在印度国内，经济濒于破产，粮食危机空前严重，民不聊生，政局动荡。印度总理在这样一个时候访问美苏，并且大肆攻击中国，正是为了迎合美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团的反华需要，以便能从这两个“大施主”的手里，乞讨更多的“援助”来应付国内外的严重困难，并且以此来转移印度人民的视线。
    甘地夫人继承了乃父尼赫鲁的衣钵，在这次出访中，积极奉行尼赫鲁所制定的亲美、联苏、反华路线。在美国，她吹捧约翰逊是一个“有崇高理想的人”和“伟大总统”，是印度的“崇高的”朋友，她同约翰逊的会谈使“美国同印度更加靠拢”，她甚至以印度卖身投靠美帝国主义为荣，说什么“印度对美国来说，同美国对印度来说一样重要”，谁也离不开谁。另方面，她三番两次地攻击中国，而且调门一次比一次高。她重弹所谓中国“威胁”、“侵略”印度的滥调，诽谤中国不希望印度次大陆有和平，说什么中国感兴趣的是那里“尽量发生动乱和不稳定”等等。这位印度总理最后索性彻底地脱下“不结盟”的破烂外衣，完全按照美国的腔调叫嚷：“对共产党中国扩张的威胁，必须不仅用军事手段，而且用政治手段和经济手段加以遏制。”她不顾印度陷于内外交困、连日子也很难混下去的处境，竟然想充当美国反华政策的先锋，叫嚷印度正在“进行反对中国共产主义的战斗”。
    约翰逊对于印度总理的这番表现甚表满意，他对印度的外交官员说，他迄今已接待了二十一个国家的政府首脑，而“这次印度（美国）会谈是最为满意的一次”。腊斯克也说，这是美印关系中“新的一章的开始”。就在甘地夫人访美期间，约翰逊除了宣布要拿出三亿美元来成立一个“印美基金会”之外，还要求国会同意再“紧急”运给印度三百五十万吨粮食，连同过去答应的六百五十万吨粮食及其它农畜产品，价值约达十亿美元。这表明印度对美国的仰赖已达到不能自拔的地步。印度报业托辣斯四月四日从新德里发出的一条评论，表达了印度对美国主子的赏赐感到心满意足的心情。这条评论说：甘地夫人“对中国对亚洲的威胁所作的估计，以及就印度致力协助遏制它所作的说明，看来给了约翰逊总统深刻的印象，约翰逊总统当即宣布他的国家准备通过国际性的努力，来帮助印度的经济发展。”
    美国和印度报刊并不讳言美印两国加紧勾结是出于共同的反华需要。美国《新共和》周刊在会谈前夕写的一篇文章中明白指出：印度“现在面临独立以来最大的危机，急需美国帮助它解决这场危机”；而对美国来说，“印度是一个同赤色中国抗衡的重要反共国家。有些人设想，印度将同日本和亚洲其他国家携起手来，挫败中国人的阴谋”。“现在的重要问题是：华盛顿是否准备用巨款支持印度的这种抗衡。”后来的事实表明，约翰逊政府为了收买印度“抗衡”中国果然付出了“巨款”。
    《印度斯坦时报》也在甘地夫人启程去美前的一篇报道中，预先对此行结果表示“乐观”。报道说：“促进这种乐观估计的是，从美国和印度之间最近的外交来往中产生的对于共同政治利益的进一步了解。这多半是以两国对中国的共同态度为中心的。”报纸还说，“据说约翰逊认识到需要加强印度对中国的防御”，并且“认为印巴协议是对付中国的最好的防御”。
    甘地夫人在访美前后和访美期间力竭声嘶地发出反华叫嚣，同样地得到苏联领导人的欣赏。苏联对这位印度总理给予了极为热情友好的接待，柯西金在她在莫斯科停留的短短两天中，同她在“热情、友好的气氛中”举行了数次会谈，赞扬她是“印度和苏联之间友谊的密切联系的象征”。双方还大肆吹嘘由尼赫鲁和赫鲁晓夫在共同反华中所建立起来的“印苏友谊”，柯西金同甘地夫人都表示要继续加强“印苏友谊”，以便共同反华。尽管苏联自己的日子也不好过，没有专门表示将提供粮食来帮助解决印度目前粮食问题上的严重困难，但是，据甘地夫人在莫斯科对记者宣布，苏联答应“将根据印度（今年开始）的第四个五年计划来考虑（援助）这个问题”。
    甘地夫人在这次出访美苏期间，一方面是为了迎合美苏共同反华和孤立中国的需要，另一方面是出于执行印度的扩张主义政策的需要，攻击巴基斯坦“违背了”美苏合谋的产物“塔什干宣言”，力图破坏巴基斯坦同中国的友好关系。她在纽约攻击巴基斯坦关于在克什米尔举行公民投票的正义要求，是要“破坏（印度）这个国家”，说什么“现在谈论公民投票是太晚了”。为了取得美国的支持，甘地夫人说，“克什米尔对于印度在拉达克防御中国极为重要”。她曾经向约翰逊提出“巴中友谊发展”的问题，在同柯西金会谈时也对巴中友谊“表示不安”。
    甘地夫人的反华、反巴、企图破坏中巴友谊的手法，正好投合了美苏两国的心意。甘地夫人七日在印度议会得意洋洋地宣布，美苏两国首脑“对巴基斯坦最近发表的挑衅性言论都感到相当不安”。她证实苏联为此已决定派一个“使节”去巴基斯坦讨论此事。她还说，约翰逊表示完全了解“巴基斯坦同中国日益友好的危险”。印度联合通讯社报道说，“苏联向巴基斯坦政府表示它对巴基斯坦领导人最近发表的某些反印讲话感到关注。”“莫斯科对拉瓦尔品第说，这些讲话违背塔什干精神。”这家通讯社透露，莫斯科已向巴基斯坦提出了“劝告”。《印度时报》更露骨地说，对于中巴友好，“不仅使美国恼火，而且也使在设法遏制北京的影响的苏联感到恼火”，“俄国对巴基斯坦的一意孤行的反映就象美国一样激烈”。巴基斯坦《建设报》一针见血地道破了美苏两国如此仇视中巴友好的原因。这家报纸四日发表文章说，“苏联现领导勾结美帝国主义是企图遏制中国迅速发展的力量和政治影响。”
    印度总理在此行中，还就越南问题在美苏之间穿针引线，充当它们之间的联络员，积极策划新的“慕尼黑”阴谋。甘地夫人在访美期间，同约翰逊商谈了越南问题。她一面公开表示“理解”美国在南越的困境，说美国“是希望和平的”，同时攻击越南民主共和国拒不“让步”。她鼓吹召开日内瓦会议“和平解决”越南问题。在苏联，她同苏联部长会议主席柯西金也着重讨论了越南问题。她同柯西金谈了些什么，双方都讳莫如深。但是，甘地夫人回国后四月七日在印度议会上透露，她曾经同美苏两国首脑策划召开“在日内瓦协议基础上”的“一次会议”，作为兜售在越南问题上的“和谈”骗局的交易所。她颇为得意地说，约翰逊和柯西金“都赞赏”印度在越南问题上的立场。
    印度总理的这次美苏之行，在世人面前又一次暴露了美帝国主义，苏联修正主义领导集团和印度反动派勾结在一起，反对中国和反对亚洲其他国家人民的邪恶意图，同时也进一步暴露出，印度反动派已经堕落到成为美帝国主义和苏联修正主义卑顺的奴才的地步。
    帝国主义和一切反动派总是要干损人利己的勾当的。但是，它们最后总是搬起石头砸了自己的脚。
