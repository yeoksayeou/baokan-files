    What should we "learn from each other"?
    Li Lianshui, Deputy Regimental Commander of a certain unit of the Public Security Forces
    In the ending of the film "Battle of the City", the director intentionally arranged a little episode: After the uprising of the 369th Division, the small Kuomintang soldier met our big PLA soldier. Amidst a harmonious playful atmosphere, the small soldier earnestly said: "Take care of me in the future!" The big soldier "humbly" replied: "We must learn from each other!"
    The small Kuomintang soldier and our big PLA soldier can learn from each other, the Kuomintang army and the People's Army can learn from each other, what a preposterous argument! The Kuomintang army is an army that opposes communism and the people, an instrument for the big landlords and big bourgeoisie to oppress the people; our army is the people's army, an armed group that carries out revolutionary political tasks. These are two armies with fundamentally opposing class interests. What can our People's Army learn from it? Learn from it to oppose the interests of the people, and serve the big landlords and big bourgeoisie? Learn from it to oppose communism and the people, and work for fascism? Learn from it to oppress and exploit the people, and collude with it? We cannot. Following the example of the Kuomintang army can only change the color of our army, turning our revolutionary army into a reactionary army.
    Perhaps the film's director will say that this refers to the relationship between the big PLA soldier and the small KMT soldier as individuals. Saying this might seem to rescue the director, but it still doesn't help. What kind of person is the small KMT soldier? He is a ruffian. Captured three times, and returning to the Kuomintang army three times; loyal and devoted to Zheng Hanchen; "dreaming of becoming an official"; a special agent regiment deputy gives him a cigarette, he drops it on the ground, and he still picks it up... Is such a ruffian also worth "learning" from?
    Perhaps the film's director will say that the "learning from each other" mentioned here refers to the relationship between our army and the uprising troops of the enemy army. Saying this also cannot save the director. You must know that when the enemy army revolts and surrenders, it does not mean that their class position has been transformed. Turning from a reactionary stance to the people's stance requires a long and arduous transformation, a fundamental change. To think that once the enemy army lays down its weapons, we can treat them as brothers and learn from each other, isn't this abandoning revolutionary principles, blurring the essential difference between the enemy army and our army?

### “互相学习”什么？

    “互相学习”什么？
    公安部队某部副团长　李连水
    在影片《兵临城下》的结尾里，编导者别有用心地安排了一个小插曲：三六九师起义后，国民党小个子兵与我军大个子兵相逢，在一片和谐的戏谑声中，小个子兵郑重其事地说：“往后多关照！”大个子则“谦逊”地回答：“互相学习嘛！”
    国民党小个子兵与我军大个子兵可以互相学习，国民党军队与人民的军队可以互相学习，这真是奇谈怪论！国民党军队是反共反人民的军队，是大地主大资产阶级压迫人民的工具；我军是人民的军队，是执行革命的政治任务的武装集团。这是两种阶级利益根本对立的军队，我们人民的军队能向它学习什么呢？学习它反对人民的利益，去为大地主大资产阶级效劳吗？学习它反共反人民，去为法西斯卖命吗？学习它欺压和榨取人民，与它同流合污吗？不能。向国民党军队看齐的结果，只能使我们的军队改变颜色，把我们革命的军队改变为反动的军队。
    也许影片编导者会说，这里指的是大个子兵和小个子兵个人之间的关系。这样说似乎可以救影片编导者的驾了，但仍然无济于事。小个子兵是个什么样的人呢？他是一个兵痞。三次俘虏，三次又回国民党军队；对郑汉臣忠心耿耿，鞠躬尽瘁；“做梦也在想当官”；特务团副施舍给他一支烟，丢在地上了，他还要拣起……。这样的兵痞难道也值得“学习”吗？
    也许影片编导者又会说，这里讲的“互相学习”，指的是我军与敌军起义部队的关系。这样说也并不能救影片编导者的驾。要知道，敌军起义了，投降了，并不等于他们的阶级立场已经得到改造。从反动的立场转向人民的立场，必须经过长期艰苦的改造，脱胎换骨的变化。以为敌军放下了武器，我们就可以与他们称兄道弟，互相学习，这不是放弃革命原则，模糊敌军和我军的本质区别，又是什么呢？
