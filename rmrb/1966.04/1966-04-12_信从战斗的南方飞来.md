    Have you read the two collections of letters called "Letters from the South"? These letters, written by the people of South Vietnam to their relatives and friends in North Vietnam, must have deeply touched your heart with their intense hatred of the American puppet clique and their love for the motherland and ardent desire for liberation, right?
    In Vietnam, many Vietnamese comrades spoke to me with great pride and care about letters from their relatives and friends in the South. In their hearts, these letters are not just ordinary missives from afar. They are sparks of thought and feeling from loved ones in battle, the crystallization of their heartfelt emotions, the voices of the fighting Southern people, and the most intimate, familiar, and touching true portrayals of the fighting silhouette of the South, the "iron wall of the motherland."

    Sentences and Lines That Inspire
    Comrade L, who had gathered from the South and moved north, said: "These letters are more precious than gold, bringing news of our flesh and blood in the South. Each letter is personal, yet they all seem to belong to everyone. Every word seems to echo the voice of the South of our motherland. We often read them together, again and again, becoming more and more convinced that the struggle of our Southern relatives will victoriously develop, and becoming more and more inspired in our work." He also told me with particular joy that they increasingly felt that the situation of letters from the South could also allow people to see the progress of the Southern people's victories. From initially receiving only sporadic letters from the South to receiving more and more; from initially only having small slips of paper as letters to later having complete letters; from initially focusing on writing about the resistance of relatives under the heavy pressure of the enemy to recently writing extensively about the victorious scenes of the Southern people. From the situation of letters from the fighting South, one can also see that the Southern people are becoming stronger and stronger in the struggle, the liberated areas are expanding, the Southern people have already created a good situation, and are advancing towards new victories.
    The two selections of "Letters from the South" are only a part of the many letters from the South in previous years. How many are there, added together, that have been selected and those that have not yet been selected? These letters have a tremendous motivating and inspiring force for the Southern comrades in the North and for the Northern people.
    Many Vietnamese comrades spoke of Southern letters encouraging them to work valiantly for the anti-American and national salvation cause. In an area not far north of the 17th parallel, I met Comrade C, a commander of the public security armed forces. His hometown is on the other side of the Hien Luong River, but the enemy divided Vietnam and also blocked news from home. His family letters, like other Southern letters, had to be circuitously transferred across the river to the north bank. Letter after letter brought news that made him clench his fists in anger, and more and more brought good news of victory. This thin, energetic man talked about the Southern letters he received, which were simply pictures of struggle. During the anti-French war, more than twenty of his relatives were killed by the invaders. After defeating the French colonialists and achieving victory, the American invaders and their running dogs ravaged his hometown again. In Southern letters received earlier, he read the news that one of his younger brothers and one of his younger sisters had been brutally murdered by the American puppet clique. Old and new hatreds motivated the relatives remaining in the South to rise up and fight, and also motivated him to fight to defend the North. His son, who stayed in the South, has now grown up and joined the Liberation Army. His son wrote in a letter that he would dedicate everything to completely defeating the American invaders. This father spoke with a happy smile about the contents of a recent letter from his son. The young South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldier wrote to ask his younger brother in the North if he knew what he was studying for, to make sure that his younger brother understood his responsibilities, and to grow up quickly to participate in the revolution and defeat American imperialism. Comrade C's family letters thus constantly wrote of deep hatred for the invaders and scenes of his relatives fighting: one of his nephews escaped from the enemy's prison and continued to fight. His daughter, who stayed in the South, also began to participate in the struggle. His mother recently told him that his hometown had become a liberated area, and that he should work hard in the North, and that the family in both the North and the South would contribute to defeating the American invaders.
    Comrade C simply spoke so kindly about the encouragement that Southern letters gave him, and he was unwilling to talk much about his own achievements in dedicating himself to his work. However, in the team he commanded, under his command, the soldiers shot down dozens of American planes, wounded and set fire to dozens more, and captured batches of the enemy's "special forces." These achievements were all condensed with his painstaking effort. He spoke of his soldiers with such affection, talking about their heroic deeds. He said: "Most of our soldiers are from the South, and everyone is determined to fight for the liberation of the South, the defense of the North, and the reunification of the motherland. How can we forget our relatives in the South? We must fight the American invaders together with our Southern relatives." The topic of Southern letters had just finished when it was midnight. In the distant sky, American planes were buzzing annoyingly. Comrade C looked at the oil lamp and said: "In this fighting environment, we can only talk to you under the oil lamp, but under the oil lamp, we feel that the day when we completely defeat the American invaders and reunify the motherland is getting closer and closer."

    Storms Under the Pen, Songs of Triumph in the Letters
    Southern letters were initially for relatives and friends. Now, not only are the letters to relatives and friends increasing with the development of the Southern people's struggle, but also the letters sent from the South to some fraternal units in the North are increasing. These letters are a true record of the Southern children's personal participation in the anti-American struggle, so they are especially real to the people in the North, whether they are relatives, friends, or members of fraternal units. They clearly tell the people in the North the picture of the victorious development of the Southern struggle that the letter writers have personally seen.
    If the situations reflected in these two types of letters from the same region are compared, then it can be seen even more how the Southern letters reflect the current storm of the Southern people's struggle and the constantly transmitted songs of triumph of the Southern people's struggle.
    Comrade Ming, who had been away from his Southern hometown for a long time and worked in the North, spoke with such excitement and pride about the fighting scenes of his hometown and relatives that he knew from the letters when he talked to me about Southern letters. In the area of Phu Cat district in Binh Dinh province, his hometown, a strong revolutionary storm is sweeping against the American invaders and their running dogs. In the vast countryside, mass armed struggles to destroy the enemy puppet regime have been launched time and time again. The Liberation Army and guerrillas are fiercely attacking American paratroopers and puppet troops in that area, battle after battle. In his hometown, Ding Shi Xiang, a female hero who persisted in the struggle in the enemy's prison and was heroic and unyielding, appeared. He was particularly pleased that, in the revolutionary storm in his hometown, his eighty-year-old mother was also continuing to engage in revolutionary activities, and the old lady was contributing her strength to the new struggle. The young people in his family were also working locally, and one of his younger brothers was fighting in the Liberation Army to eliminate the American puppet troops. He and his comrades treasured these Southern letters, flipping through them from time to time, because these were the voices of their relatives fighting in their hometown.
    Also from the area of Comrade Ming's hometown, a People's Revolutionary Youth League branch in the Liberation Army named after the hero Qu Zheng Lan of the anti-French period, sent a letter to a Labour Youth League branch in Ha Tinh province in North Vietnam. From this Southern letter to the fraternal unit, we can see the heroic posture of the Southern children resolutely attacking the American invading army and the running dog army, and we can also see the embarrassing appearance of the American invading army being beaten. This letter has played a huge inspiring role among the vast number of young people in Ha Tinh province, and they want to launch a revolutionary competition with the fraternal Southern young soldiers in the anti-American and national salvation struggle. Vietnamese newspapers have already published this letter. We might as well see how the Liberation Army soldiers wrote about their combat experience in this Southern letter!
    In the Thuan Ninh area there, the Liberation Army soldiers crushed the offensive of two battalions of the US 1st Air Mobile Division in a battle, frustrated the enemy's helicopter airlift tactics, shot down ten US aircraft, and killed more than two hundred American invaders, including one captain and two lieutenants. When this letter wrote about the situation of this battle, it was written in a joyful and powerful tone like this:
    "In order to defend every inch of our motherland's land, we repeatedly fought with the enemy for every hill and repelled the enemy's many offensives. Through actual combat, we felt that fighting the Americans was really enjoyable. These American soldiers are all tall and clumsy, easy to aim at, and when they are hit, they fall headlong like a broken sandbag. While fighting, we promptly informed all parts of the results of annihilating the American devils, in order to encourage each other, hold our ground, and continue to eliminate more enemies. The cheers of our army's victory often drowned out the enemy's gunfire and the enemy aircraft's frantic roars.
    "When the American army fought with our Liberation Army, these soldiers of the American 1st Air Mobile Division, who were praised by the Washington authorities, really made fools of themselves. Some of them crawled, some lay motionless in the fortifications, and some lay straight in the open space, looking like a four-legged snake with its tail broken off, looking very embarrassed.
    "Despite the enemy aircraft's frantic bombing and strafing, our League members were all very calm, 'biting' the enemy and not letting go, and immediately giving them a fatal blow when they jumped out of the helicopter..."
    When this letter also wrote about the fighting in the areas of Phu Cat and Phu My in Comrade Ming's hometown, it was again a picture of heroic annihilation of the American invaders: "This time, our unit's task was to snipe at the enemy, and we put forward the slogan that no matter whether they are mechanized units, infantry, or landed by aircraft, we are determined to eliminate them all. We quickly occupied the position and waited calmly for the enemy's arrival. A chariot team consisting of twelve M-113 amphibious armored vehicles came to its death. One of our League members approached the enemy vehicle only ten meters before firing, killing the leading one, making the entire chariot team unable to move forward. At this time, we rushed up and killed the enemy like a landslide. Some League members were in unfavorable terrain, but still held their positions and fought to the end. As a result, five M-113s became five iron coffins, two were severely damaged, and more than fifty American soldiers were killed or wounded."
    When you read these descriptions of the combat scenes written by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldiers themselves, are you not more vividly understanding the scenes of the Southern people bravely annihilating the Americans? Does this not allow you to more specifically understand the fearless spirit of the Southern people's soldiers, who despise the enemy and hate the enemy? Perhaps, there are now more convenient conditions that make it possible for the news of the Southern people's battles to be spread more quickly, but these Southern letters, which come from the combatants' own personal experience, are always so heartwarming and moving.
    The letters selected in the two "Letters from the South" collections that have been compiled in the past have shown the struggle and mood of the Southern people some time ago with strong accusations and impassioned fighting determination. Today, the new large number of Southern letters are already writing about the Southern people's struggle in a new stage of marching towards victory, and are already writing about making new records of more violent attacks on the American invaders and their running dogs. It is already much more convenient for relatives and comrades in the North to communicate with people in the South through letters. We believe that, along with new and greater battles, greater victories, and more news of victory, there will also be more letters conveying the victorious mood of the Southern people flying from the South to the North. These letters will enable the people of South and North Vietnam to more closely encourage each other and compete with each other in the struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, and to advance together to welcome new and greater victories!

### 信从战斗的南方飞来

    信从战斗的南方飞来
    你读过那两本名叫《南方来信》的书信集吗？这些由越南南方人民写给在越南北方亲友的信，也曾以那强烈的憎恨美伪集团和热爱祖国、热望解放的感情深深打动你的心吧？
    在越南，多少越南同志以十分自豪、珍重的心情，对我谈着南方亲友们的来信。在他们的心眼里，这些信那里只是通常说的远方来鸿，这是亲人们在战斗中的思想感情的火花，这是亲友们心血的结晶，这是战斗着的南方人民的声息，这是“祖国铜墙”的南方那副战斗身影的最亲切、最熟悉、最动人的传真写照。
    句句行行　鼓舞人心
    一位从南方北上集结出来的L同志说：“这些信比黄金还要宝贵，它们带来的是南方骨肉的消息。每封信是个人的，又都象是大家的，每句话都象是响着祖国南方的声音。我们大家常常一起一遍又一遍地读，越读越相信南方亲人的斗争一定会胜利地发展，越读越能鼓舞我们工作。”他还特别以喜悦的感情告诉我说，他们越来越觉得，南方来信的情况还可以让人们看到南方人民胜利发展的进程。从开头只能零星收到南方来信，到越来越多；从开头只能有小纸头的信，到以后有了完整的信；从开头着重写亲人在敌人重压下的抗争，到近来大写南方人民胜利情景；从战斗的南方来信的情况，也可以看到南方人民在斗争中越战越强，解放区越来越扩大，南方人民已经打出一个好局面，并且向新胜利前进。
    两本《南方来信》选集，只是头些年许多南方来信的一部分。已选的，未来得及选的，加在一起该有多少呢？这些信对在北方的南方同志，对北方人民说来，那种激励鼓舞的力量是极大的。
    很多越南同志谈起南方来信鼓舞他们为抗美救国英勇工作。在靠十七度线以北不远的地区，我遇见一位公安武装的指挥员C同志。他的家乡就在贤良江那边，但是敌人分割越南，也阻隔着家里的音信。他的家信也同别的南方来信一样要经过曲折的转递捎过江北。一封封来信，带来了使他握拳奋起的消息，也越来越多地带来了胜利的喜讯。这位清瘦、精干的汉子，谈到他收到的南方来信，简直是一幅幅斗争的图画。抗法战争中，他的亲属被侵略者杀害了二十多人。等到打败了法国殖民者，取得了胜利，美国侵略者及其走狗又蹂躏着他的家乡。在以前接到的南方来信中，他读到了这样的消息，他的一个弟弟和一个妹妹，又被美伪集团残杀了。旧恨新仇，激励着留在南方的亲人奋起战斗，也激励着他为保卫北方而战斗。他的留在南方的男孩现在已经长大，参加了解放军。儿子曾来信写着要为彻底打败美国侵略者献出一切。这位父亲带着欣慰的笑容说起不久前接到儿子新近来信的内容。年青的南越解放军战士写信问在北方的小弟弟知道不知道学习为了什么，要弟弟明确自己的责任，要赶快成长参加革命，打败美帝国主义。C同志的家信就这样不断写来的是对侵略者的深仇大恨，是亲人们的战斗情景：他的一个外甥从敌人监狱里越狱出来继续战斗。他的留在南方的女儿也开始参加斗争。他的妈妈新近又告诉他，家乡已成解放区，要他好好在北方工作，一家人在南北都为打败美国侵略者贡献力量。
    C同志只是那么亲切地谈到南方来信对他的鼓舞，他并不愿意多谈自己献身工作的成绩。但是在他指挥的队伍里，战士们在他的指挥下，打下了成十架的美国飞机，打伤起火的又有几十架，还抓住了一批又一批的敌人的“别动队”。这些事迹都凝注着他的心血。他谈起自己的战士来，那么喜爱地说着他们的英雄事迹。他说：“我们的战士大多是南方人，大家决心为解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国而战斗。我们怎么能忘记在南方的亲人呢？我们要和南方亲人一起打美国侵略者。”在这次谈到南方来信的话题刚刚谈完，已是半夜。远天，美国飞机在讨厌地嗡嗡作响。C同志望着油灯说：“在这种战斗的环境下只能和你在油灯下谈话，但是，油灯下，我们倒感到的是彻底打败美国侵略者、统一祖国的日子越来越近了。”
    笔底风暴　信里凯歌
    南方来信，起初是给亲友的。现在不仅给亲友的信随着南方人民斗争的发展而越来越多，从南方寄给北方一些结义单位的信，也越来越多。这些信是南方儿女亲身参加抗美斗争的实录，因而对北方的亲友或者结义单位的人们读来都格外真切。它们把写信人亲眼看到的南方斗争胜利发展的图景清晰地告诉北方的人们。
    如果从这两类信反映的同一个地区的情形对照起来，那么就更可以看出南方来信怎样反映着目前南方人民的斗争风暴，和不断传来南方人民斗争胜利的凯歌。
    有一位长期离开南方家乡在北方工作的明同志，当他同我谈起南方来信，他是那样兴奋，那样自豪地说着他从信里知道的家乡和亲人的战斗情景。在他的家乡平定省符吉县一带，那里掀起着冲击美国侵略者及其走狗的强烈的革命风暴。在广大农村，一次又一次掀起了摧毁敌伪政权的群众武装斗争。解放军和游击队在那一带一仗又一仗狠狠打击着美国伞兵和伪军。在他的家乡出现了在敌人监狱坚持斗争英勇不屈的女英雄丁氏香。他特别欣喜的是，就在家乡的革命风暴中，他的八十多岁的老母亲也在继续从事革命活动，老人家在新的斗争中贡献着力量。他家里的青年人也在当地工作，他有一个弟弟在解放军里为消灭美伪军而战斗。他和他的同志把这些南方来信珍重地积存起来，不时翻阅，因为这是亲人们在家乡斗争的声音。
    也就从明同志家乡那一带，传来了解放军中一个以抗法时期英雄瞿正兰命名的人民革命青年团支部，给越南北方河静省一个劳动青年团支部的信。从这封给结义单位的南方来信里，我们看到的是当前南方儿女坚决打击美国侵略军和走狗军的英姿，也可以看到美国侵略军挨打的狼狈相。这封信已经在河静省广大青年中起了巨大的鼓舞作用，他们要同结义的南方青年战士们在抗美救国斗争中展开革命竞赛。越南报纸上已经发表了这封信。我们不妨看看在这篇南方来信里解放军战士们怎样写自己的战斗经历吧！
    在那里的顺宁地区，解放军战士们在一次战斗中粉碎了美国第一空中机动师的两个营的进攻，挫败了敌人的直升空运战术，击落美机十架，击毙美国侵略者二百多名，其中有一名上尉和两名中尉。当这封信写到这次战斗的情况，是以欢快有力的笔触这样写的：
    “为了保卫我们祖国的每一寸土地，我们同敌人反复争夺着每一座山丘，打退敌人的多次进攻。通过实际的战斗，我们感觉到打美国佬实在过瘾。这些美国兵个个生得又高又笨，很容易瞄准，而且一打中就象断线的沙袋一样沉甸甸的倒栽下来。我们一面战斗，一面及时向各个部分通报歼灭美国鬼的结果，以互相勉励，坚守阵地，继续消灭更多的敌人。我军胜利的欢呼声往往淹没了敌人的枪炮声和敌机疯狂的吼叫声。
    “当美军同我们解放军作战时，这些被华盛顿当局捧上天的美国空中第一机动师的士兵们真是丑态百出，他们有些爬着，有些伏在工事里一动不动，有些却躺直在空地里，活象一条被打断尾巴的四脚蛇，样子非常狼狈。
    “尽管敌机进行疯狂的轰炸和扫射，但我们团员个个都非常沉着，‘咬’住敌人不放，等敌人跳出直升飞机时就立即给予致命的打击。……”
    当这封信也写到在前面那位明同志家乡符吉、符美一带战斗的时候，又是一幅英勇歼灭美国侵略者的图景：“这一次我们单位的任务是狙击敌人，我们提出不管它们是机械化部队、步兵还是由飞机空运着陆，都决心把它全部消灭的口号。我们迅速占领了阵地和沉着地等待敌人的到来。一个包括十二辆M—113两栖装甲车的战车队送命来了。我们一个团员摸到接近敌车只有十米才开枪，干掉了为首的一辆，使整个车队不能前进。这时，我们便冲上去，把敌人杀得落花流水。有些团员处于不利的地形，但仍然坚守阵地，战斗到最后。结果五辆M—113变成了五口铁棺材，二辆被严重损坏，五十多名美国兵被打死或打伤。”
    当你读到这些出自南越解放军战士亲手写的战斗情景的描述，难道不是更加生动地了解了南方人民勇猛歼美的情景吗？难道不是从这里让你更具体地了解了南方人民战士那种蔑视敌人、仇恨敌人的大无畏的精神面貌吗？也许，目前已经有了更方便的条件，使南方人民的战斗消息可以更迅速地向外传播了，但是，这出自战斗者自己亲身经验的南方来信，却总是那样叫人倍觉亲切和动人。
    过去已经编成两本《南方来信》集子中所选的信件，曾经以强烈的控诉和激昂的战斗决心表明了前些时候南方人民的斗争和心情。今天，新的大量的南方来信，已经是在写南方人民迈步走向胜利的新阶段的斗争了，已经是在写向美国侵略者及其走狗进行更猛烈的打击的新纪录了。在北方的亲友和同志们和南方的人们在信件来往上已经是大大方便。我们相信，与新的更大的战斗、更大的胜利、更多的胜利讯息一起，也将要有更多的传达南方人民胜利心情的信，从南方向北方飞来。这些信，将使越南南方和北方的人民，在抗美救国的斗争中，更加密切地互相鼓励，互相竞赛，为迎接新的更大的胜利而共同前进！
