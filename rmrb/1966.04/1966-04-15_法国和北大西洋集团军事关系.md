    France and the Military Relationship with the North Atlantic Group
    Question: Recently, I saw news reports stating that France announced its intention to withdraw from the military "integration" structure of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and demanded that the United States withdraw its bases, equipment, and troops from France. I wonder how many troops France contributes to the North Atlantic Group? What is the situation regarding American military bases and troops stationed in France? Could you provide a brief introduction?
                              Jinan Reader, Lin Ming
    Answer: According to the original provisions for military "integration" of the North Atlantic Group, France provides the North Atlantic Group, which is controlled by the United States, with five divisions of the army during peacetime and ten more divisions during wartime. In wartime, the Navy will hand over the Mediterranean Fleet and the Atlantic Fleet to the command of the "Mediterranean Allied Command," "Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic," and "Allied Command Channel," respectively. On the air force side, it normally submits eight regiments belonging to the French First Tactical Air Force Command, and other domestic air force units in wartime. At the same time, France also sends officers to hold positions in major institutions of the North Atlantic Group.
    However, from March 1959, France has continuously taken back command authority from the North Atlantic Group over all of its Navy and part of its Air Force, and three army divisions. Now, France is preparing to continue withdrawing the following forces from the North Atlantic Group: two army divisions, two independent regiments, one independent battalion, and three tactical rocket battalions; air force units include two air force regiments and two anti-aircraft missile brigades. These land and air forces are stationed in West Germany, totaling approximately 70,000 people.
    In addition, France has also requested that the North Atlantic Group withdraw the following facilities and personnel from its territory:
    Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE, located in Rocquencourt near Paris), with 500 officers and 2,500 soldiers. Headquarters, U.S. Army Europe (USAREUR, located near Saint-Germain), with 850 soldiers. Headquarters, Allied Forces Central Europe (AFCENT, located in Fontainebleau), with 2,000 soldiers.
    The North Atlantic Group's telecommunications system in France, including microwave and tropospheric scatter, as well as landline communication networks, is valued at $550 million. The air defense and alarm system is valued at $300 million.
    The United States has approximately 30,000 troops stationed in France, as well as nine air force bases located in Evreux and Chateauroux, and forty supply depots and port facilities. There are also three NATO oil pipelines and one American oil pipeline running across France. These pipelines can transport 90,000 barrels of oil per month, enough to supply all the fuel for 1,200 aircraft and the vehicles of the U.S. Seventh Army stationed in West Germany. The total value of American facilities and equipment in France is $1.75 billion, of which real estate is worth approximately $300 million.

    法国和北大西洋集团军事关系
    问：最近，看到报载消息，法国宣布要退出北大西洋公约组织军事“一体化”机构，并要美国撤出在法国的基地、设备和军队。不知法国在北大西洋集团有多少兵力？美国在法国的军事基地和驻军情况如何？请简单介绍一下。
                              济南读者　林鸣
    答：根据北大西洋集团军事“一体化”的原来规定，法国向美国控制的北大西洋集团提供的兵力，陆军平时五个师，战时再交十个师。海军战时将地中海舰队和大西洋舰队分别交由“地中海盟军司令部”、“大西洋盟军最高司令部”和“海峡盟军司令部”指挥。空军方面，平时提交法国第一战术空军司令部所属的八个联队，战时提交其他本土空军部队。同时，法国还派遣军官在北大西洋集团主要机构中担任职务。
    但是，从一九五九年三月起，法国不断地收回北大西洋集团对法国所提供的全部海军与部分空军指挥权，和三个陆军师。现在，法国准备继续从北大西洋集团撤出的兵力有：陆军两个师、两个独立团、一个独立营、三个战术火箭营；空军部队有两个空军联队和两个防空导弹旅。这些陆、空军都驻在西德，共计约七万人。
    此外，法国还要求北大西洋集团从它的领土上撤走下列设施和人员：
    欧洲盟军最高司令部（设在巴黎附近的罗肯固），拥有五百名军官和二千五百名士兵。驻欧美军司令部（设在圣日耳曼附近），拥有八百五十名士兵。中欧盟军司令部（设在枫丹白露），拥有二千名士兵。
    北大西洋集团在法国的电讯系统，包括微波和对流层散射以及陆上线路等通讯网，价值五亿五千万美元。防空和警报系统，价值三亿美元。
    美国在法国的驻军约三万人，还有设在埃夫勒和夏托鲁等地的九个空军基地，四十个供应仓库以及港口设施。还有北大西洋公约组织的三条输油管和美国的一条横贯整个法国的输油管。这些油管每月可输油九万桶，足以供应一千二百架飞机和美国驻西德的第七军车辆的全部燃料。美国在法国的设施和设备总值是十七亿五千万美元，其中不动产的价值约三亿美元。    （志光）
