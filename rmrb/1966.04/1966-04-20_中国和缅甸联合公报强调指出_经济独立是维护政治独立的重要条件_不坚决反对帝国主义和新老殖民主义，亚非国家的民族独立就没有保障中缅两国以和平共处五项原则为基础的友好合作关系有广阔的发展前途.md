      I. At the invitation of General Ne Win, Chairman of the Revolutionary Council of the Union of Burma, Liu Shaoqi, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, and his wife paid a friendly visit to the Union of Burma from April 17 to April 19, 1966. Accompanying Chairman Liu Shaoqi on the visit were Chen Yi, Vice Premier and Minister of Foreign Affairs of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, and his wife, Zhang Hanfu, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and other senior officials of the People's Republic of China.
    II. The people and government of the Union of Burma are pleased with Chairman Liu Shaoqi's second friendly visit to the Union of Burma. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and his entourage expressed their gratitude for the warm welcome and cordial hospitality they received during their visit.
    III. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and General Ne Win held talks on issues of common concern to both countries and the situation of the anti-imperialist struggle in Asian and African countries. The talks were held in a friendly spirit, which has always been a characteristic of the relations between the two countries. The talks were very beneficial and further enhanced mutual understanding.
    IV. Chairman Liu Shaoqi and General Ne Win expressed satisfaction with the steady development of friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. Both sides are pleased to see that the Sino-Myanmar Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement is being smoothly implemented, and that engineers from both countries have established good cooperative relations.

Both sides pointed out that Asian and African countries should further strengthen unity to eradicate old and new colonialism and defend world peace.
    VI. The Burmese side reiterated its support for the restoration of the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, opposed the "Two Chinas" plot, and supported the just struggle of the Chinese government and people to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Chinese side expressed its gratitude for this and reiterated that China cherishes the policy of peaceful neutrality pursued by the government of the Union of Burma in international affairs, and firmly supports the struggle of the Burmese government and people to defend national sovereignty and national independence.
    VII. Both sides believe that mutual visits by state leaders of the two countries are of great significance for enhancing friendly cooperation between the two countries. Chairman Liu Shaoqi's second visit to the Union of Burma has made a valuable contribution to strengthening friendly cooperation between the two countries.
