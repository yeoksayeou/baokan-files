    Xinhua News Agency, April 25th, Santo Domingo dispatch: Over 60,000 citizens of Santo Domingo, the capital of the Dominican Republic, held a massive anti-American rally on the 24th, angrily denouncing the bloody crimes of American imperialism's armed aggression against the Dominican Republic. This grand mass rally was held to commemorate the first anniversary of the Dominican people's armed uprising.
    Before the mass rally began, over ten thousand people held a demonstration march in the streets. They held high banners with anti-American slogans and waved the flags of revolutionary organizations such as the "June 14th Revolutionary Movement" and the "Dominican People's Movement," marching through the city streets toward the rally site. While passing Conde Street, the demonstrators angrily shouted: "Yankees get out!" and "If the Yankees don't get out, they will die in Quisqueya (Dominican Republic)!" The demonstrating masses also surrounded a car carrying three American reporters, shouting "Yankees go home!" and damaging the car.
    After the march, over 60,000 citizens participated in the mass rally held in Independence Park. Representatives of workers, students, and women spoke at the meeting, strongly condemning the armed intervention of American imperialism in the Dominican Republic, and calling on the Dominican people to continue fighting against the American military occupation. Their speeches received warm applause and support from the masses participating in the rally. At the rally, when demonstrators burned an American flag to express their angry protest against the American aggressors, the masses erupted in enthusiastic cheers.
    A band played the "April 24th Revolutionary Song" at the rally. It ignited the anti-American anger in people's hearts. The masses at the meeting sang along with the music in indignation, expressing the Dominican nation's long-standing old and new hatred of the American aggressors.
    According to reports, the American aggressors were heavily guarded during the demonstration march held by the masses on the 24th. Wherever the demonstrating masses went, they were met with reactionary police armed with carbines and grenades, and an American helicopter patrolled the sky to threaten the demonstrators. However, the mighty demonstration army overwhelmed the reactionary arrogance of the American aggressors with a dauntless revolutionary spirit.
    The fact that the citizens of Santo Domingo held a large-scale anti-American demonstration fully demonstrates that once the heroic people, unafraid of brute force and daring to fight, are widely mobilized, they become an invincible force.

    多米尼加人民以大无畏革命精神纪念爱国武装起义一周年
    圣多明各六万余人奋起声讨美国侵略者
    新华社二十五日讯　圣多明各消息：多米尼加首都圣多明各六万多市民二十四日举行了声势浩大的反美集会，愤怒声讨美帝国主义武装侵略多米尼加的血腥罪行。这次盛大的群众集会是为纪念多米尼加人民武装起义一周年而举行的。
    在群众集会开始前，有一万多名群众在大街上举行示威游行。他们高举写着反美口号的横幅标语，挥舞着“六月十四日革命运动”和“多米尼加人民运动”等革命组织的旗帜，通过市区大街向集会地点行进。在经过孔德大街时，示威者愤怒地高呼：“美国佬滚出去”、“美国佬要是不滚出去，就得死在基斯克亚（多米尼加共和国）”。示威群众还围住了三名美国记者乘坐的一辆汽车，高呼“美国佬滚回去！”并且打坏了这辆汽车。
    游行结束后，有六万多名市民参加了在独立公园举行的群众集会。工人、学生和妇女的代表在会上发言，强烈谴责美帝国主义对多米尼加的武装干涉，号召多米尼加人民为反对美国的军事占领而继续斗争。他们的讲话受到参加集会的群众的热烈鼓掌和支持。在集会上，当示威者焚烧一面美国国旗表示对美国侵略者的愤怒抗议时，群众发出了热烈的欢呼声。
    一支乐队在集会上演奏了“四·二十四革命曲”。它激发了人们心头的反美怒火。与会群众随着乐曲愤慨高歌，表达了多米尼加民族长期以来对美国侵略者的旧恨新仇。
    据报道，在二十四日群众举行示威游行时，美国侵略者戒备森严。示威群众所到之处，都布满了拿着卡宾枪和手榴弹的反动警察，同时还出动一架美国直升飞机在天空巡逻，对示威者进行威胁。但是浩浩荡荡的示威大军以大无畏的革命气势压倒了美国侵略者的反动气焰。
    圣多明各市民举行的反美大示威这个事实充分表明不畏强暴、敢于斗争的英雄人民一经广泛动员起来，就是一支不可征服的力量。
