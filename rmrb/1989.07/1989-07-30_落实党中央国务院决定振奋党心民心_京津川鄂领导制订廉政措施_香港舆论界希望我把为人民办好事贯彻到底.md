The Communist Party of China Beijing Municipal Committee held a meeting of its Standing Committee today to study and discuss the "Decision on Several Urgent Matters of Concern to the People" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. All members unanimously endorsed the decision and agreed that its spirit is equally applicable to the situation in Beijing. They resolved to firmly implement it. The meeting decided that Beijing will first focus on several key areas, starting with the Standing Committee members and deputy mayors.

1. Further clean up and streamline companies, resolutely dissolving and merging those that should be dissolved and merged, with a focus on companies engaged in commercial, material supply, financial, and foreign trade activities, as well as companies run by party and government organs. Dissolution should be the primary approach.

2. Strictly prohibit the children of high-ranking officials from engaging in business. This policy will start with the Standing Committee members and deputy mayors, implementing a policy of avoidance.

3. Strictly adhere to regulations for vehicle allocation and prohibit the import of small cars. The municipal party secretary Li Xicun and mayor Chen Xitong will switch to domestically produced cars. Some leaders who currently use imported cars will gradually replace them with domestically produced ones.

4. Strictly prohibit entertaining and gift-giving. Standing Committee members and deputy mayors are not allowed to use public funds to entertain domestic guests; when visiting subordinate units and grassroots levels, they must eat working meals, with standards strictly regulated and supervised by the Municipal Finance Bureau. No gifts, samples, or other items may be accepted under any name or pretext. Violations will be held accountable.

5. Strictly control the overseas travel of leading cadres. Deputy bureau-level and above cadres must travel for work-related purposes and obtain approval from the mayor or relevant deputy mayors; they must not create pretexts to use subordinate units' overseas travel quotas and funds; they must not accept invitations from foreign companies or overseas Chinese-funded enterprises to travel abroad.

6. Expedite the investigation and prosecution of economic crimes. Major cases must be investigated and prosecuted. Corruption, bribery, speculation, and other criminal cases must be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted according to the law, regardless of who is involved. Those who interfere with or shield the investigation process will be publicly exposed and severely punished. Confessions and surrenders should be encouraged according to the deployment of the Central Committee and the State Council, to further combat serious economic crimes.

Tianjin

Our reporter Xiao Dan reported from Tianjin on July 30: The Communist Party of China Tianjin Municipal Committee and the municipal government today made specific regulations on clean governance in line with Tianjin's actual situation, determined to fulfill them one by one and boost party and public morale.

The decision by the Party Central Committee and the State Council on clean governance has sparked strong reactions in various circles in Tianjin. Yesterday morning, after the news was broadcast, our reporter saw people spreading the word on the streets. An elderly man exercising in the morning said: "This is exactly what we need."

In accordance with the spirit of the central decision, the Tianjin Municipal Committee and the municipal government decided today that the following eight things must be done in the near future: accelerate the cleanup and streamlining of companies and handle the investigation and organizational processing; resolutely stop the children of municipal-level leading cadres from engaging in business; strictly adhere to regulations for vehicle allocation and prohibit the import of small cars; strictly prohibit the use of public funds for entertaining and gift-giving; resolutely stop leading cadres from illegally purchasing or building houses; resolutely curb the trend of showing off and flaunting wealth; strictly control the overseas travel of leading cadres; and seriously and thoroughly investigate and prosecute cases of corruption, bribery, speculation, and other crimes, especially major cases. Among these eight items, Tianjin, in conjunction with the most strongly voiced concerns of the masses and the characteristics of the city, specifically stipulated that the real estate development group, commercial economic development company, and 12 other companies under the relevant commissions of the municipal government will be the focus of inspection; starting with the Standing Committee members and deputy mayors, a policy of avoidance will be implemented for the issue of children engaging in business; all departments are strictly prohibited from using public funds to purchase or build high-standard housing for leading cadres, nor are they allowed to use public funds or public property to renovate their homes. It is also stipulated that current district, county, and bureau-level and above leading cadres are strictly prohibited from fishing in rural fish ponds.

The responsible comrades of the Tianjin Municipal Committee and the municipal government mentioned in the discussion and adoption of these specific regulations that in the past, we have had many good decisions, but they were not implemented, often turning people's excitement into disappointment. At this critical historical moment, clean governance must be strictly enforced to gain the trust of the people.

Sichuan

Our reporter Luo Maocheng reported from Chengdu on July 30: The Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Sichuan Provincial Committee held an expanded meeting yesterday evening to seriously study and discuss the "Decision" and "Notice" recently passed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in seven areas and strengthening propaganda and ideological work. They resolved to combine Sichuan's actual situation, practice clean administration, and severely punish corruption, setting an example for all party members and cadres in the province.

Everyone agreed that the seven urgent matters proposed by the Party Central Committee, which are of great concern to the people, and the decision to start with the leading comrades of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, are a great education and inspiration for the entire party's broad cadre. In the past, some regulations by the Central Committee were only for the lower levels, so although there were regulations, they were not implemented or had little effect. This time, the Central Committee has made a great decision to start with itself, and the issues raised are so practical and specific, truly setting an example for the entire party. Everyone agreed that the Standing Committee members and deputy provincial governors above should set an example in the province by being clean and diligent, and resolutely stop their spouses and children from engaging in business.

Some comrades spoke, saying that the cleanup and streamlining of companies in Sichuan Province have done a lot of work in the past, but we should not overestimate the achievements. For deeper issues, such as bribery, kickbacks, and speculation, they all need to be further investigated. The provincial-level companies and bureau-level companies should be audited one by one, those that need to be cut should be cut, and those that need to be dissolved should be dissolved. The problem of leading cadres holding concurrent positions in companies must be thoroughly solved. The leader of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission expressed that they will soon publicize several major cases involving bureau-level cadres that have been investigated, to enhance the people's confidence in fighting corruption.

The meeting also discussed in depth the issues of prohibiting entertaining and gift-giving, purchasing agricultural and sideline products at low prices from lower levels, cadres occupying multiple houses and building private houses, and leading cadres' children being recruited, transferred, and studying abroad, and put forward many good measures and suggestions. The meeting entrusted relevant departments to quickly formulate specific regulations so that cadres at all levels can implement and execute them accordingly.

Hubei

Our reporter Li Yongchang reported from Wuhan on July 29: The Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China Hubei Provincial Committee decided today that the import of small cars will be prohibited in the province in the future. All members of the Provincial Committee and the provincial government's governors and deputy governors will lead by example in using domestically produced cars. The replaced imported cars will not be redistributed within the organs but will be used for social services. This morning, the presiding member of the Standing Committee, Provincial Committee Secretary Guan Guangfu, said that not long ago, General Secretary Jiang Zemin inspected Hubei's flood control work and showed great concern for the people's hardships. Now, the Central Committee has decided to do several things that the people care about. This is of great political significance for boosting party and public morale, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to persist in socialism, do a good job in reform and opening up, and the four modernizations, and for promoting the transformation of style and leading by example in clean administration and diligent work at all levels of party committees and governments.

After fully studying the problems that the people are dissatisfied with in the entire province, especially in the provincial party and government leadership organs, the meeting decided to solve some prominent problems, including:

Continuing to expedite the cleanup and streamlining of companies. Especially for companies in the circulation sector that violate laws and regulations, they must be resolutely investigated and prosecuted. Regardless of the company, all illegal gains will be confiscated.

Immediately cancel the special supply of vegetables and side dishes to deputy bureau-level and above cadres by the small kitchen and the special supply of cigarettes and alcohol during festivals. The small kitchen of the Provincial Committee and the provincial government will be changed to a canteen for the organs.

All leading cadres must strictly adhere to regulations for vehicle allocation, and vehicles are prohibited from being used for private matters. Throughout the province, when traveling within the province and receiving domestic guests, everyone must insist on eating portioned meals.

Continuing to expedite the investigation and prosecution of cadres illegally building private houses. The funds and materials for cadres building private houses must be thoroughly investigated, and they must not be allowed to gain any advantage. The residences of leading cadres are not allowed to be renovated or rebuilt beyond standards, and the furniture inside the residences, including air conditioners and their electricity bills, must be self-funded.

The Hubei Provincial Committee also made specific decisions on stopping cadres from seeking private interests abroad and expediting the investigation and prosecution of major cases.

Hong Kong

Our reporter reported from Hong Kong on July 30: The decision by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to do seven things has sparked a significant reaction in Hong Kong. The media believes this is a good thing and hopes that by October, there will be a breakthrough in clean governance and the fight against corruption, to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The signed article in today's "Ta Kung Pao" believes that "the seven things that need to be done in the near future are particularly urgent and important. If corruption can be punished and privileges can be eliminated, from top to bottom, from the central to the local levels, if some real things can be done, people's morale will be boosted." The article also points out, "whether these seven things are done well or not, it relates to the fate of the party and the government." It also says: "If the country does not start with urgently rectifying corruption and limiting bureaucratic privileges, it will be difficult to overcome the current economic, inflation, and other difficulties."

Today's "Wen Wei Po" published a special report stating, "Such a meeting is rare in recent years. First, the meeting formulated regulations for the Political Bureau, the Secretariat, and the Standing Committee of the State Council to be clean and diligent, and publicly announced the specific steps and measures for fighting corruption and promoting clean governance. Second, it touched on the business activities of the children and relatives of high-ranking officials of the Communist Party, and promised to investigate and audit and then announce to the society, increasing transparency." The special report finally points out: "People hope that by October, there will be a breakthrough in clean governance and the fight against corruption. It seems that the new leadership also urgently needs to present a new image in style to the people of the whole country. If these seven things can be done well, it can be said to be a gift from the high-level to the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation."

"The Sing Tao Daily" also published an editorial titled "The Difficulties in Fighting Corruption and Promoting Clean Governance Are Still Many." It says: "Eliminating corruption within the party and eliminating official profiteering is something that should have been done a long time ago," "it is necessary to be determined, with a fearless spirit, to carry out the good work for the people to the end, because this is a major task related to the future of the party and the nation."

Several Hong Kong newspapers also published the speech by the Financial Secretary of the Hong Kong Government, Lin Dingguo, at a seminar yesterday. Lin Dingguo expressed his belief that the Chinese government wants to rectify some state-owned enterprises in Hong Kong, only to improve the profitability and operation of these companies, which is beneficial to the economy of Hong Kong and the shareholders of these companies in Hong Kong. He also said that foreign companies review the business of their subsidiaries in Hong Kong every year, and the Chinese government's approach is not surprising, and the review will not affect the economy of Hong Kong. If the operating efficiency and profits of state-owned enterprises can be improved, it will bring benefits to Hong Kong.

Mr. Wu Kangmin, a member of the National People's Congress and a member of the Basic Law Consultative Committee of Hong Kong, also expressed his views in an interview with a reporter, saying: "The Central Committee's decision is a good thing," he also said: "To have results, we need to see if the Communist Party has the determination."

    天　津
    本报天津7月30日电　记者肖荻报道：中共天津市委、市政府今天结合天津实际做出廉政建设的具体规定，决心逐一兑现，振奋党心民心。
    党中央、国务院决定在廉政建设方面近期要做的7件事，在天津各界引起强烈反响。昨晨，这一消息播出后，记者从街头巷尾看到人们奔走相告。一位晨练老人说：太对心思了。
    根据中央决定精神，天津市委、市政府今天作出决定近期要做好8件事：加快清理整顿公司的进度，抓紧查处工作和组织处理；坚决制止市级领导干部子女经商；严格按规定配车，严格禁止进口小轿车；严格禁止用公款请客送礼；坚决制止领导干部违纪买房、建房；坚决刹住讲排场、摆阔气的不良风气；严格控制领导干部出国；严肃认真地查处贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪案件，特别要抓紧查处大案要案。在上述8件事中，天津结合群众反映最强烈的方面及本市特点，具体规定了要把市政府有关委所属的房地产开发集团、商业经济开发公司等12家公司作为检查重点；从市委常委、副市长做起，在子女经商问题上实行回避政策；各部门一律不准用公款为领导干部购建高标准住房，也不得动用公款、公物对其住房进行装修。还规定了现职区、县、局以上领导干部一律不得到农村养鱼池钓鱼。
    天津市委、市政府负责同志在讨论和通过这些具体规定时特别提到，过去我们也有过不少好的决定，但未能切实兑现，使人民往往从兴奋转为失望。在当前重要历史时刻，廉政建设必须令行禁止，取信于民。
    四　川
    本报成都7月30日电　记者罗茂城报道：中共四川省委昨晚召开常委扩大会议，认真学习、讨论中共中央、国务院最近通过的抓好7件事的“决定”和加强宣传、思想工作的“通知”，决心结合四川的实际，廉洁行政，力惩腐败，为全省党员干部作出表率。
    大家认为，党中央提出当前迫切需要做好的人民群众普遍关心的7件事，并且决定首先从党中央和国务院的领导同志做起，这对全党广大干部是一个极大的教育和鼓舞。过去中央有的规定是对下不对上，因此虽然有了规定却贯彻不下去或收效不大。而这次中央下大决心从自己做起，所提的问题又是那样实在、具体，确实为全党作出了榜样。大家赞同省委常委和副省长以上的干部，要在全省带头廉洁奉公，艰苦奋斗，坚决制止自己的配偶、子女经商等意见。
    有的同志发言说，清理整顿公司，四川省前段时间作了不少工作，但对成绩不能估计过高。对深一层次的问题，诸如贿赂、回扣、倒买倒卖等问题，都还需要进一步深查。对省管的几个大公司和厅局办的公司要一个一个审查，该砍的砍，该撤的撤。要彻底解决领导干部在公司兼职的问题。省纪委领导表示最近要把查实的涉及厅局级干部的几个大案尽快公布，以增强人民群众反对腐败的信心。
    会议还结合四川的实际，对禁止请客送礼问题、低价向下面购买农副土特产品问题，对干部多占住房、建私房的问题，以及领导干部子女招工招干、调动工作、出国学习等等问题，进行了热烈的讨论，提出了许多好的措施和建议。会议委托有关部门尽快制订具体规定，以便各级干部对照贯彻执行。湖　北
    新华社武汉7月29日电　（记者李永长）中共湖北省委常委会议今天决定，省内今后禁止进口小轿车。省委全体常委和省政府正、副省长要带头用国产车，替换下来的进口车，一律不在机关内搞再分配，全部用于社会服务。今天上午，主持常委会的省委书记关广富说，前不久，江泽民总书记视察了湖北的抗洪工作，非常关心人民疾苦。现在，中央又决定做几件群众关心的事，这件事对于振奋党心民心，充分调动广大人民群众坚持社会主义、搞好改革开放和四化建设的积极性，对于推动各级党委、政府转变作风，带头廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗，都具有重大的政治意义。
    会议在充分研究了湖北全省特别是省党政领导机关当前存在的群众不满意的一些问题以后，决定解决好一些突出问题，其中包括：
    ——继续抓紧清理整顿公司。特别是对流通领域内违法乱纪的公司要坚决查处，不论什么公司，凡非法所得，一律没收。
    ——立即取消小灶食堂对副厅级以上干部的蔬菜、副食品的供应和节日烟酒的“特供”。省委、省政府的小灶食堂改为机关食堂。
    各级领导干部严格按规定配车，车辆禁止办私事。全省上下在省内出差和接待内客一律坚持吃一人一盘一汤的份饭。
    ——继续抓紧查处干部违法违纪建私房的问题。对干部建私房的资金、材料来源，要彻底查清，绝不能让其占便宜。领导干部的住宅不准搞超标准装修改建，住宅内的家具包括空调及其电费，一律自理。
    湖北省委对制止干部出国谋私、抓紧查处大案要案等问题也作了具体决定。
    本报香港7月30日电　中共中央政治局会议决定中央要做7件事情，在香港引起较大反响，舆论界认为这是好事，希望在10月以前，廉政与肃贪能有所突破，向国庆40周年献礼。
    《大公报》今天发表的署名文章认为，“近期内要做的7件事格外显得迫切和重要。如果真能惩治贪污，摒弃特权，从上到下，从中央到地方做一些实事，人心就会振奋”。文章还指出，“这7件事办不办得好，关系到党和政府的命运。”还说：“国内如果不从迫切整治贪污、限制官僚特权着手，就很难渡过当前面对的经济、通胀等难关。”
    《文汇报》今天发表一篇特稿认为，“这样的会议在近年是少见的。第一，会议订出了政治局、书记处、国务院常务会议成员廉洁奉公的规定，并公布肃贪倡廉的具体步骤和措施。第二，触动到与中共高层人物子女、亲属有关的经商行为，允诺调查审计后向社会公布，增强透明度。”特稿最后指出：“人们希望10月以前，廉政肃贪能够有突破。看来新领导层也急需在作风方面予全国人民一个新的形象。如果真能做好7件事，可以说是高层给国庆40周年的献礼”。
    《天天日报》还专门就此发表题为《肃贪倡廉困难仍多》的社论。说：“在党内清除贪污，消灭官倒，本来是早就应该做的好事”，“必须下决心，以大无畏精神，把为人民办好事贯彻到底，因为这是一个关系到党国前途的重大任务。”
    多家香港报纸今天还同时发表了香港政府金融司林定国昨日在一个研讨会上的讲话，林定国表示，他相信中国政府要整顿在港的一些中资机构，只是想改善这些公司的盈利和运作，这对香港经济和公司的香港股东都有好处。他还说，外国公司每年均对在港分公司进行业务审查，中国政府做法不足为奇，审查对香港经济不会有影响。若能改善中资公司的运作效率和经营利润，对香港将带来好处。
    全国人大代表、香港基本法咨询委员会委员吴康民先生在接受记者访问时也表示：“中央作出这样的决定是好事”，他还说：“要有成果，须看中共是否有决心。”
