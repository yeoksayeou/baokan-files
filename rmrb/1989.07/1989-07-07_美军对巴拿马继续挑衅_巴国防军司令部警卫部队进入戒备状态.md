U.S. military forces stationed in the Panama Canal Zone have continued their provocative actions despite protests from Panama.

On the afternoon of the 6th, as students from the University of Panama were protesting in front of the Organization of American States office in Panama City against the U.S. military exercises in Panama, a military helicopter from the U.S. Southern Command flew at low altitude over the headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces, engaging in provocative behavior. The helicopter hovered for 30 minutes before leaving, carrying rocket launchers and other advanced weapons on its body.

In response to the U.S. military threat, the guard units of the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters immediately went on high alert.

On the 5th, Panama issued a statement protesting the U.S. military's repeated provocations and military intimidation against Panama since July. The development of this new situation has drawn serious attention from the Panamanian authorities.

    巴国防军司令部警卫部队进入戒备状态
    新华社巴拿马城7月6日电　驻扎在巴拿马运河区的美军不顾巴拿马方面的抗议，继续采取军事挑衅行动。
    6日下午，正当巴拿马大学的学生在美洲国家组织驻巴拿马办事处门前抗议美国在巴拿马接连举行军事演习时，美国南方司令部的一架军用直升机低空飞到巴拿马国防军司令部驻地上空，进行挑衅。直升机在空中盘旋了30分钟后才飞走，机身上携带有火箭炮和其他先进武器。
    面对美国的军事威胁，巴拿马国防军司令部的警卫部队立即进入了戒备状态。
    巴拿马5日曾发表声明，抗议美军7月以来不断对巴拿马进行挑衅和军事恐吓。这一新事态的发展，已引起巴拿马当局的严重关注。
