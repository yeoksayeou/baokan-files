Yunnan's civil affairs and judicial departments have been cleaning up illegal marriages within the province, taking appropriate measures to handle them, and achieving remarkable results.

Since 1982, Yunnan has had 2,136,000 couples get married, among whom a significant proportion were illegal marriages, accounting for 20.7% (576,000 couples). Of these illegal marriages, 1,999,000 couples were underage, 5,299 couples were related by blood, 512 couples involved individuals with diseases, and 569 couples were cases of bigamy. Local governments and civil affairs departments at various levels have done a great deal of meticulous work to address this issue. They have used a combination of education and legal measures to handle the problem. They have legally helped 498,000 couples, accounting for 86.5% of all illegal marriages, to complete their marriage registration. They have also issued notices to 540,000 couples who were underage at the time of marriage to complete their registration upon reaching the legal age. For the 752 couples involved in bigamy or other serious illegal activities, they have handed the cases over to the judicial departments for handling.
