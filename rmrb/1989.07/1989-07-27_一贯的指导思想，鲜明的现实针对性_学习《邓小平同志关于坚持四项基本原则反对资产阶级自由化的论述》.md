	In the current study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches, re-reading his ten-year-long discussions on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization is very helpful for summarizing historical experiences, unifying ideological understanding, and conducting this political struggle well. It has great educational significance.

	Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization has been an important guiding thought of Comrade Xiaoping since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The bourgeois liberalization trend emerged soon after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Its essence is to deny the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. As soon as this erroneous trend appeared, Comrade Xiaoping clearly proposed at the Party's theoretical work conference in 1979 that achieving the Four Modernizations must uphold the Four Cardinal Principles. When a wave of opposition to the Four Upholds emerged in 1980, Comrade Xiaoping further pointed out that the tendency of bourgeois liberalization must be criticized. Over the past ten years, the opposition and struggle between bourgeois liberalization and the Four Upholds have been ongoing, rising and falling. Whenever the trend of bourgeois liberalization emerges, Comrade Xiaoping reminds people to pay serious attention to this issue and not let it spread. On this issue, Comrade Xiaoping's attitude has always been resolute and clear, never wavering or compromising. Even recently, he still said: "The Four Upholds themselves are correct. If there is any mistake, it is that the Four Cardinal Principles have not been upheld consistently enough and have not been used as a fundamental ideology to educate the people, students, all cadres, and Communist Party members." However, the comrades who were in charge of the central leadership at that time took a soft stance on this major issue concerning China's future and destiny, tolerating and allowing the bourgeois liberalization trend to develop, which resulted in serious losses. Comrade Zhao Ziyang should have learned from this, but he disappointed the Party and the people's expectations. During his tenure, he completely adopted a passive attitude towards the policy of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly said that the struggle against bourgeois liberalization is a long-term one, spanning several decades, and must be conducted in parallel with the Four Modernizations, permeating the entire process of the Four Modernizations. However, the struggle against bourgeois liberalization launched in 1987 was hastily concluded in just two months, stopping halfway. Comrade Zhao Ziyang actually encouraged and tolerated the liberalization trend, allowing it to spread to a serious extent, becoming one of the main causes of this turmoil. In his recent important speech, Comrade Xiaoping pointed out, "This turmoil was bound to happen. It was determined by both the international climate and China's own climate." Comrade Zhao Ziyang bears an irrefutable responsibility for the formation of China's climate. We must systematically study Comrade Xiaoping's discussions, reflect deeply on the actual situation, and firmly establish the idea of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, carrying the struggle against bourgeois liberalization to the end.

	From Comrade Xiaoping's series of discussions, we can see a prominent feature: these ideological discussions have strong practical relevance. The famous discussion on the need to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles in ideological and political work in 1979 was directed against some people who attempted to shake these basic principles at that time. In early 1980, Comrade Xiaoping noticed the emergence of the bourgeois liberalization trend, which might lead to turmoil like the Cultural Revolution, and timely reminded people: "There are some social trends, especially among some young people, that need serious attention. If we let it go unchecked, what will happen? There are plenty of examples in the world, and there are also plenty in China. Don't think that such actions won't cause trouble and can be taken lightly." He especially reminded comrades in the fields of propaganda, education, theory, and literature that if there are major deviations in these areas of work, it can also fuel the development of destabilizing factors. By the end of the same year, Comrade Xiaoping further pointed out: Some places have already discovered that a small group of troublemakers are using the methods of the Cultural Revolution to incite and cause trouble. Illegal organizations and publications controlled by a very small number of bad leaders are actively connecting, and anti-party and anti-socialist speeches are openly published. Serious situations such as distributing reactionary leaflets, spreading political rumors, arson, and leaking and selling state secrets have occurred. "This dangerous signal should alert the entire Party, the entire nation, and all young people in the country!" Comrade Xiaoping's thought-provoking words are like a warning against the current reality. In his discussions, Comrade Xiaoping not only pointed out the seriousness of the problem but also proposed the principles and measures for the struggle and made far-reaching considerations. For example, he proposed that this struggle must be conducted within the legal framework and that we must learn to use legal weapons. To uphold the socialist system and build modernization, he also proposed four guarantees, including the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, the construction of the Party, and the rectification of the Party's organization and style. He earnestly educated the youth: China's history tells us that China cannot take the capitalist road; China has no other path but socialism. Once China abandons socialism, it will return to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. Forget about achieving a "moderately prosperous society"; there is no guarantee of even basic sustenance. These important ideas of Comrade Xiaoping should be more widely studied and propagated. The struggle between the Four Upholds and bourgeois liberalization will continue for a long time, which is an objective law that does not change with people's will. Comrade Xiaoping's discussions on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization have both immediate guiding significance and long-term historical significance.

	This book of "Discussions" is edited with the theme of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles. Emphasizing this theme at present does not affect the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy, nor does it affect the focus on economic construction. On the contrary, it is to better implement the political line of focusing on economic construction and better implement the policy of reform and opening up. In short, it is to fully and accurately implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress. The 39 discussions in the book are selected from 23 speeches and talks, and are basically selected in full paragraphs, relatively completely reflecting a thought, avoiding the problem of taking things out of context. All discussions are arranged in chronological order, making it convenient for people to understand how Comrade Xiaoping gradually deepened his discussions on this aspect in response to actual problems arising from the development of the objective situation. Due to appropriate selection, the discussions relatively completely and coherently reflect Comrade Xiaoping's thoughts, and all discussions seem to be a newly written article. This provides convenience for us to systematically study Comrade Xiaoping's important thoughts in this aspect.

    一贯的指导思想，鲜明的现实针对性
    学习《邓小平同志关于坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化的论述》
    潘荣庭
    在当前学习邓小平同志重要讲话的时候，重读他十年来关于坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化的论述，对于总结历史经验，统一思想认识，搞好这场政治斗争，很有帮助，很有教育意义。
    坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化，是小平同志十一届三中全会以来一贯的重要指导思想。资产阶级自由化思潮在十一届三中全会以后不久就已出现，它的实质是否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。这种错误思潮刚一冒头，小平同志就在1979年召开的党的理论工作务虚会上旗帜鲜明地提出，实现四个现代化必须坚持四项基本原则。在1980年掀起一股反对四个坚持的思潮时，小平同志更加明确地指出，要批判资产阶级自由化的倾向。十年来，资产阶级自由化同四个坚持的对立和斗争，时起时伏，始终不断。每当资产阶级自由化的思潮抬头，小平同志就提醒人们要严重注意这个问题，不能使它泛滥开来。在这个问题上，小平同志的态度始终是坚决的、清醒的，从来没有含糊过，从来没有让过步。直到最近他还讲：“四个坚持本身没有错，如果说有错误的话，就是坚持四项基本原则还不够一贯，没有把它作为基本思想来教育人民，教育学生，教育全体干部和共产党员。”但是，当时主持中央领导工作的同志，却在这个关系中国前途命运的重大问题上退让、容忍，采取了软弱的态度，从而助长了资产阶级自由化思潮的发展，曾经造成严重损失。赵紫阳同志本应从中吸取教训，把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争认真地进行下去，然而，他辜负了党和人民对他的期望，在他的任职期间，完全采取消极对待坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化的方针。小平同志反复地讲，反对资产阶级自由化的斗争是长期的，要搞几十年，要把它同四化建设平行起来，贯穿在四化建设过程之中。然而，1987年开展的反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，两个月就草草收兵，半途而废。赵紫阳同志在实际上助长和纵容了自由化思潮，以致达到严重泛滥的地步，成为导致这次动乱的主要原因之一。小平同志在最近的重要讲话中指出，“这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的”。对中国小气候的形成，赵紫阳同志负有不可推卸的责任。我们系统地学习小平同志的论述，要联系实际进行深刻的反思，牢固树立坚持四项基本原则的思想，把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争进行到底。
    从小平同志的一系列论述中可以看到一个鲜明的特点，就是这些思想论述有很强的现实针对性。1979年提出的在思想政治上必须坚持四项基本原则的著名论述，就是针对当时有些人企图动摇这些基本原则讲的。1980年初，小平同志察觉到资产阶级自由化思潮的出现，可能引起像“文化大革命”那样的动乱，及时提醒人们：“现在有一些社会思潮，特别是一些年轻人中的思潮，需要认真注意。”“如果让它漫无限制地搞下去，会出现什么事情？世界上的例子有的是，中国的例子也有的是。不要以为这样搞就不会出乱子，可以掉以轻心。”他特别提醒思想战线上宣传、教育、理论、文艺部门的同志，如果在这些方面的工作出了大的偏差，也可以助长不安定因素的发展。同年年底，小平同志进一步指出：有些地方已经发现，一小撮唯恐天下不乱的人正在用“文化大革命”中的办法进行煽动和闹事，极少数坏头目操纵的非法组织、非法刊物积极串连，反党反社会主义的言论公开发表，发生了散发反动传单、传播政治谣言、杀人放火、泄露和出卖国家机密等严重情况。“这种危险的信号，应该引起全党、全国人民和全国青年的足够警惕！”小平同志这些发人深省的话，就像是针对当前现实讲的。小平同志在论述中，不仅指出了问题的严重性，而且提出了进行斗争的方针措施，并且作了深远的考虑。例如，他提出这场斗争一定要在法律范围内进行，要学会使用法律武器。为了坚持社会主义制度、搞好现代化建设，他又提出四个保证，包括社会主义精神文明建设，党的建设和党的组织、作风的整顿。他语重心长地教育青年：中国的历史告诉我们，中国走资本主义道路不行，中国除了走社会主义道路没有别的道路可走。一旦中国抛弃社会主义，就要回到半殖民地半封建社会，不要说实现“小康”，就连温饱也没有保证。对小平同志这些重要思想，应当进行更广泛的学习和宣传。四个坚持同资产阶级自由化的斗争将长期地进行下去，这是不以人们的意志为转移的客观规律。小平同志关于坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化的论述，不仅有现实的指导意义，而且有长远的历史意义。
    这本《论述》是以坚持四项基本原则为主题编辑的。当前强调这一主题，并不影响改革开放方针的贯彻，更不影响以经济建设为中心。恰恰相反，是为了更好地贯彻执行以经济建设为中心的政治路线，更好地实行改革开放的方针，一句话，为了完整地准确地贯彻执行十三大确定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线。书中的39段论述是从23篇讲话、谈话中节选出来的，在编选上基本是整段选用，比较完整地体现一个思想观点，避免发生断章取义。全部论述都按时间顺序排列，便于人们了解小平同志是怎样针对客观形势发展中出现的实际问题一步一步地加深自己这方面的论述的。由于取舍适当，比较完整地连贯地反映了小平同志的思想，全部论述好像是新写的一篇文章，这为我们系统学习小平同志这方面的重要思想提供了方便。
