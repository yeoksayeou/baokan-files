According to relevant experts, the divorce rate in Taiwan has been rapidly increasing in recent years, making it the highest in the world.

Professor Chái Sōnglín of Taiwan's National Chengchi University established the "Late Autumn Women's Association" specifically for women facing marital difficulties and divorce. He stated that over the past 20 years, the divorce rate in Taiwan has increased by more than threefold. Currently, the ratio of married couples to divorced individuals is 6:1, and it is projected that by 1990, this ratio will increase to 3.5:1.

Statistics show that in 1966 and 1967, Taiwan's divorce rate was only 0.35 per thousand, marking the lowest period in the region's divorce rates. However, starting from 1968, the divorce rate began to rise gradually, reaching 1.29 per thousand by 1987, setting a record of a more than threefold increase in divorce rates over the past 20 years.

In the first half of this year, the Taipei District Court handled 102 divorce cases. Over half of these divorce lawsuits were initiated by couples who had been married for more than 10 years, and most were filed by women, primarily due to abandonment by their husbands or the husbands being sentenced to prison.

Many people believe that the rapid increase in divorce rates is related to changes in family livelihoods and societal values.

The Taiwanese media have placed their hopes in strengthening ethical and moral education and changing the value system that prioritizes money and material wealth to curb the rising trend in divorce rates. However, whether these hopes can be realized remains uncertain.

    台湾离婚率居世界之首
    据有关专家统计，台湾地区近年来离婚率剧升，已居世界首位。
    台湾政治大学教授柴松林专为婚姻触礁及离婚妇女创设了一个“晚晴妇女协会”。他说，近20年来，台湾地区离婚率上升率逾3倍以上，目前结婚夫妇与离婚男女对数比是6∶1，预计到1990年将增为3.5∶1。
    据统计，1966年和1967年，台湾的离婚率仅千分之零点三五，是台湾地区离婚比例最低的时期。但从1968年开始离婚率逐渐上升，到1987年已上升到千分之一点二九，创下近20年离婚率上升3倍多的最高纪录。
    台北地方法院今年上半年判决的离婚案件，共有102宗，其中超过半数的离婚诉讼是由结婚10年以上的夫妇提起，而且多由女方提出，原因多是遭丈夫遗弃或是对方被判刑。
    人们普遍认为，离婚率迅速上升，与家庭生计和社会价值观念改变不无关系。
    台湾舆论界把遏止离婚率上升趋势的希望寄托在加强伦理道德教育上，寄托在改变唯金钱物质为重的价值观念上。然而，这样的希望能否达到，令人感到渺茫。
