Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 27th.

North Korea held a joint meeting of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Central People's Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on June 27th to discuss issues related to the Non-Aligned Movement. Chairman Kim Il-sung attended the meeting and delivered an important speech.

The meeting believed that the upcoming 9th Summit of the Non-Aligned Countries would provide an important opportunity for all non-aligned countries to jointly uphold the fundamental principles of the Non-Aligned Movement and fulfill their historical mission.

The meeting noted that since the 8th Summit of the Non-Aligned Countries, there have been a series of encouraging changes in international relations. Tensions between the East and West have begun to ease, and some complex regional conflicts are being resolved through consultation and peaceful means. The meeting welcomed the current trend in the international arena towards easing tensions and moving from confrontation to dialogue. The meeting expressed the belief that the Non-Aligned Movement would, as always, more actively support the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's legitimate position of advocating the withdrawal of foreign troops from South Korea and the peaceful resolution of the Korean reunification issue through dialogue and consultation.
