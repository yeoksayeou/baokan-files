    The History and Current State of Martial Law
    I. The History of Martial Law
    In the history of old China, martial law was declared on numerous occasions. The Outline of the Constitution issued in the 34th year of the Guangxu era (September 1908) explicitly stated: "The Emperor has the power to declare martial law, and in times of emergency, he can restrict the freedom of his subjects by decree." On March 11, 1911, the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China was promulgated, with Article 36 stating: "The Provisional President may declare martial law in accordance with the law." On December 15 of the same year, the Martial Law Act was promulgated, with Article 1 stating: "In the event of war or other extraordinary circumstances requiring military preparedness and vigilance in the country or a region, the President may declare martial law in accordance with this law." It was also stipulated that in extremely urgent situations, local commanders could temporarily declare martial law, but they had to report to the President in detail afterward. However, these regulations became ineffective due to the warlord conflicts, especially after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Local commanders declaring martial law became commonplace. For example, during the "Zhongshan Ship Incident" in 1926, Chiang Kai-shek mobilized troops to declare martial law in Guangzhou, cutting off all communication with the outside, and arrested more than 40 communists, including Li Zhilong. It is worth noting that Chiang Kai-shek's imposition of martial law was entirely aimed at eliminating the Communist Party and suppressing the people's movements.

    Western countries also have detailed legal provisions for martial law. For example, the U.S. Constitution considers martial law to be within the "sovereignty," meaning that every government has the right to take any measures. During the economic crisis of the 1930s, governors of various states in the U.S. frequently declared martial law, with 27 states in 1934 and 32 states in 1935 mobilizing the National Guard to enforce martial law.

    After World War II, countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America also implemented martial law on numerous occasions. For instance, Indonesia enforced martial law from 1957 to 1966, lasting for nine years.

    II. The Current State of Martial Law
    In the 1970s and 1980s, governments of various countries (including some regions) increasingly imposed martial law on their own countries or parts of their countries. Pakistan was under martial law from 1977 to December 1985. India declared a long-term martial law after the assassination of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and threats of retaliation from Sikhs. Some countries or regions do not call it martial law but refer to it as a state of emergency or a state of siege, but the nature is the same. For example, Nicaragua declared a state of emergency in March 1983, which continues to this day, and Peru declared a state of emergency in 1983 for 19 provinces.

    Currently, China's imposition of martial law in Lhasa and Beijing is in accordance with the constitutional provisions, and its necessity and importance are self-evident. This is fundamentally different from the martial law in old China. (July 7, 1989, Zhang Qinlin's article in the People's Public Security News)

### 戒严的历史与现状

    戒严的历史与现状
    一、戒严的历史
    在旧中国的历史上有过多次戒严。光绪三十四年（1908年9月）颁发的宪法大纲中明文规定：皇帝有“宣告戒严之权，当紧急时，得以诏令限制臣民之自由”。1911年3月11日公布的《中华民国临时约法》中，第三十六条规定：“临时大总统得依法宣布戒严。”同年12月15日公布戒严法，其中第一条规定：“遇有战争或其他非常事变对于全国或一地方须用兵备警戒时，大总统得依本法宣告戒严。”还规定，在非常紧急的情况下，各地司令官可以临时宣告戒严，但事后须向大总统作详细汇报。然而，这些规定由于军阀混战已不起作用，尤其是孙中山先生逝世后，各地部队长官宣布戒严已司空见惯。如1926年的“中山舰事件”，蒋介石便调动军队对广州宣布戒严，断绝广州内外交通，逮捕了共产党人李之龙等40余人。需要特别指出的是，蒋介石实施的戒严完全是为了清除共产党，镇压人民运动。
    西方国家对戒严也有详细的法律规定。如美国宪法认为，戒严属“主权之内，即每个政府有权采取任何措施”。三十年代经济危机时，美各州州长不时宣布戒严，1934年有27个州、1935年有32个州调动国民警卫队戒严。
    亚、非、拉国家在战后也曾多次实施戒严，印尼1957年至1966年实施戒严达9年之久。
    二、戒严的现状
    世界各国政府（包括一些地区）在七十年代和八十年代对本国或国内部分地区的戒严有增无减。巴基斯坦自1977年戒严至1985年12月；印度在前总理英·甘地夫人被刺、锡克教徒扬言再次报复的情况下，曾宣布长时间戒严。有的国家或地区不叫戒严，而叫戒严状态或紧急状态，但其性质是一样的。如尼加拉瓜于1983年3月宣布处于紧急状态迄今，秘鲁也曾在1983年对19个省宣布进入紧急状态。
    目前，我国在拉萨、北京两地的戒严就是按照宪法的规定实施的，其必要性和重要性不言而喻，这与旧中国的戒严有根本的不同。（1989年7月7日《人民公安报》张勤林文）
