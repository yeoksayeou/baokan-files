By integrating administrative, technical, financial, and material resources, comprehensive service groups formed by agricultural, supply and marketing, scientific and technological, and agricultural bank departments at the county, city, and township levels have rapidly developed in Fujian Province. Currently, over 40 counties in the province have implemented group contracting, covering more than 5 million mu (approximately 333,333 hectares) of land.

This integrated service model, which combines materials and technology, as well as administration and technology, first emerged in Liancheng County in western Fujian. The county's 130,000 mu (approximately 86,667 hectares) of contracted farmland saw a grain yield increase of 50,000 tons. At the beginning of this year, the provincial Party committee and government held a rural work conference, promoting this successful experience across the province.

The contracting groups sign contracts with the government and farmers, responsible for providing comprehensive production plans, necessary agricultural materials, and funds, and for organizing implementation. Farmers, in turn, follow the technical plans diligently. Through the integration of technology and materials, the contracting groups enhance farmers' confidence in using science and technology, facilitating the implementation of production measures at the household and field levels, thereby accelerating the application of agricultural technology.

Fujian's contracting groups are tailored to local conditions, with both comprehensive and single-item services. As seen in Liancheng, regardless of the form adopted, the economic benefits are significant.

    提供配套服务  促进农业增产
    福建推广农技集团承包
    本报福州7月15日电  记者张铭清报道：由地（市）、县、乡农业、供销、科技、农行等部门组成，集行政、技术、资金、物资等配套服务为一体的综合性集团承包，在福建省迅速发展。目前，全省已有40多个县实行集团承包，承包面积达500多万亩。
    这一物（资）技（术）结合、政（行政）技结合的社会化服务，去年在闽西连城县率先出现，全县集团承包的13万亩耕地，增产粮食5000吨。今年初，省委、省府召开农村工作会议，在全省推广了这个县的成功经验。
    承包集团上与政府、下与农民签订合同，负责提供配套的增产技术方案及其所必需的农用物资和资金，并负责组织实施。农民则按技术方案的要求认真执行。集团承包通过技术、物资的结合，增强了农民使用科技的安全感，有利于把增产措施落实到户到田，从而加速了农业科技的转化。
    福建的集团承包因地制宜，既有综合性的，也有单项的。从连城的情况看，不管采用哪种形式，经济效益都是显著的。
