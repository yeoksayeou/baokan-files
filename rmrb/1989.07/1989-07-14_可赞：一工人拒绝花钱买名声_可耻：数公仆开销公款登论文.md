Recently, people in Shanxi Province have been discussing two contrasting news stories about responses to letters offering to sell "fame." One is about a worker from the Taiyuan Locomotive Factory, Liu Jianxun, who refused to buy a name and exposed the practice of paying for inclusion in a dictionary. The other is about 45 county-level officials who used public funds to publish their own papers.

Liu Jianxun, a graduate of a specialized college, has published many works. This summer, he received a letter from the editorial board of the "Dictionary of Contemporary Chinese Literature, Aesthetics, and Journalism Talents," notifying him of his selection. The letter stated that after review, the editorial board had decided to include him in the "Great Dictionary" and requested a remittance of 38 yuan for the future purchase of the dictionary. Liu Jianxun wrote to the "Taiyuan Evening News," criticizing this practice of enticing people to buy fame.

In contrast, 45 county-level officials openly used public funds to "buy" papers. Recently, the Shanxi Provincial Supervision Bureau discovered during an investigation of the magazine "Exploration of Rural Development" that it had illegally published 3 issues of the "Exchange Edition" and one supplement. These publications featured photos, biographies, and articles of 48 leaders, including 45 county-level officials from Shanxi Province. Each paper required a sponsorship of around 1,000 yuan. Currently, 21 counties have sent over 20,000 yuan to this magazine.

    可赞：一工人拒绝花钱买名声
    可耻：数公仆开销公款登论文
    新华社太原7月14日电　（记者池茂花、通讯员胡有恒）最近山西人街谈巷议着面对花钱买“名”的信函而态度却截然不同的二则新闻。一则是太原机车厂工人刘建勋不沽名钓誉，揭露花钱买“名人”出辞典，另一则是45名县委书记、县长花公款发表自己的论文。
    刘建勋大专毕业，曾发表过不少作品。今年夏天他收到一封《中国当代文学、美学、新闻人才大辞典》编委会的入选通知书，通知说，经过审定编委会正式决定将你收入《大辞典》，同时要汇38元钱作为将来辞典问世后的购书费。刘建勋投书《太原晚报》，批评了这种诱人花钱买“名”的怪事。
    与此相反的是，有45名县委书记、县长公然花公款“买”论文。山西省监察厅近日在查处《农村发展探索》杂志发“文倒”财时发现，《农村发展探索》杂志，今年非法出版了3本《交流版》、一本增刊，上面刊登了48位领导干部的照片、简历、文章，其中有45人是山西省的县委书记、县长，每篇论文要求赞助千元左右，现在已有21个县给这个杂志寄来2万多元款。
