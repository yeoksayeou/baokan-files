Reporter Zhang Shusheng reports from Lanzhou: The first modern, large-scale highway tunnel in Gansu Province—the Qidongling Tunnel on the Gansu-Chongqing Highway (National Highway 212 from Lanzhou to Chongqing)—opened to traffic today. The ribbon-cutting ceremony was held this morning.

The Qidongling Tunnel is located on the Gansu-Chongqing Highway, 22 kilometers from Lanzhou City. It is the first mountain pass on the route from the provincial capital to Sichuan, controlling the strategic gateway to the south of Lanzhou City. It serves four prefectures and cities and 23 counties within the province, making it one of the busiest sections of the Gansu highway network, with a daily traffic volume exceeding 2,000 vehicles. The completion of this north-south tunnel has fundamentally improved the driving conditions on Qidongling.

    甘肃一特大型公路隧道通车
    本报兰州7月12日电　记者张述圣报道：甘肃省第一座现代化的特大型公路隧道工程——甘川公路七道梁隧道，今日上午剪彩通车。
    七道梁隧道位于甘川公路（即212国道兰州至重庆线）上，距兰州市22公里，是甘肃省会通往四川的第一山隘，扼兰州市南出口的咽喉，服务于省内4个地州的23个县市，是甘肃公路最繁忙的路段之一，日交通量2000辆以上。这条由北向南隧道的贯通，从根本上改善了七道梁的行车条件。
