The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting

Requires the U.S. side to genuinely fulfill the armistice agreement

Xinhua News Agency Panmunjom, July 14th - (Reporter Li Nengqing) The 449th meeting of the Korean Military Armistice Commission was held today in the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission meeting room in Panmunjom.

This meeting was held at the request of the Korean Military Armistice Commission's Korean-Chinese side. The Korean Military Armistice Commission's Korean-Chinese side criticized and protested to the United Nations Command side regarding South Korea's recent continuous dispatch of warships to invade the northern territorial waters and the South Korean military's shooting incidents in the demilitarized zone towards the north.

The chief commissioner of the Korean Military Armistice Commission's Korean-Chinese side, Major General Choi Yi-hyeong, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army commissioner of the Korean Military Armistice Commission's Korean-Chinese side, Major General Tian Sheng, and the director of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army's Kaesong Liaison Office, Major General Zhao Shian, participated in today's meeting.

Choi Yi-hyeong first pointed out in his speech that South Korea dispatched three warships to form a combat formation and illegally invaded the northern waters of the 38th parallel north, 3 minutes north, 124 degrees 26 minutes east of the West Sea Changshan Island. Such invasions have occurred 33 times this year alone, with a total of 65 warships and vessels.

He said that in July, North-South Korea's multi-faceted dialogue will resume. In this situation, it is necessary to create an environment and atmosphere for dialogue. However, the U.S. side is continuously updating the equipment of the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. He demanded that the U.S. side take concrete actions to fulfill the armistice agreement.
