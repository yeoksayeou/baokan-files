	Washington, June 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of Commerce announced yesterday that by the end of 1988, the total assets of the United States abroad amounted to $1254 billion, while foreign assets in the United States totaled $1786 billion. Consequently, the total foreign debt reached $532 billion, a 40% increase from 1987. In terms of direct investment, the total direct investment of the United States abroad was $326.9 billion, while foreign direct investment in the United States was $328.9 billion.

	The United States became the world's largest debtor nation in 1985, having previously been the largest creditor nation. There have been two distinct views on this issue within the U.S. economic community. One view holds that an increase in foreign investment is not necessarily a bad thing, as it promotes the development of the U.S. economy and helps offset the federal government's budget deficit. The chief economist of the Commerce Department noted that the increase in foreign investment indicates that "foreign investors continue to have confidence in the U.S. economy." The other view, however, argues that the surge in foreign debt indicates a relative decline in U.S. economic strength, and if left unchecked, it could lead to serious future problems. The director of the U.S. International Economic Research Institute estimates that by 1992, the U.S. foreign debt will reach $1 trillion, requiring annual payments of $40 billion to $50 billion in interest and dividends.

    美国去年外债猛增
    总额达五千三百多亿美元
    本报华盛顿6月30日电　记者张亮报道：据美国商务部昨天公布，截至1988年底，美国在外国的总资产为12540亿美元，外国在美国的总资产为17860亿美元，因而外债总额高达5320亿美元，比1987年猛增40％。就直接投资而言，美国在国外的直接投资总额为3269亿美元，外国在美国的直接投资总额为3289亿美元。
    美国是在1985年由世界最大债权国沦为最大债务国的。此间经济界对此问题一直有两种截然不同的看法。一种人认为外资增加并不是坏事，因为它有利于促进美国经济的发展，而且还弥补了联邦政府的财政赤字。商务部首席经济学家指出，外资增加表明外国投资者“对美国经济继续抱有信心”。而另一种人则认为，外债剧增说明美国经济实力相对衰落，若任其发展，将来后患无穷。美国国际经济研究所所长估计，到1992年美国的外债将高达1万亿美元，每年将需支付400亿至500亿美元利息和红利。
