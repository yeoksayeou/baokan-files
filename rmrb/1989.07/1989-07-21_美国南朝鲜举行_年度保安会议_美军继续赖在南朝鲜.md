    U.S. and South Korea Hold "Annual Security Conference"
    U.S. Troops to Remain in South Korea

    Our reporter Xú Bǎokāng reports from Pyongyang, July 20: Seoul – U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and South Korean "Minister of National Defense" Lee Sang-eon held the "U.S.-South Korea Annual Security Conference" in Washington on the 19th. They reached an agreement for U.S. troops to continue their stay in South Korea and decided to continue the annual "Team Spirit" joint military exercises. This move by the United States and South Korea has been strongly opposed by the Korean people.

    According to reports, at the "U.S.-South Korea Annual Security Conference" in Washington, Cheney claimed that the 43,000 U.S. troops continuing to be stationed in South Korea is the "wish of the governments and peoples of both countries."

    Lee Sang-eon conveyed to the U.S. government the South Korean authorities' "stance of hoping for the continued presence of U.S. troops in South Korea."

    The U.S. Secretary of Defense and the South Korean "Minister of National Defense" declared that the current situation in Northeast Asia is not optimistic, and that "strengthening the military alliance between the United States and South Korea is a necessary precondition for dealing with this situation."

    According to reports, the U.S. side demanded that South Korea abandon its plans to jointly produce fighter jets and instead directly purchase F-16 or F-18 fighter jets from the United States. South Korea has agreed to this U.S. demand.

    美国南朝鲜举行“年度保安会议”
    美军继续赖在南朝鲜
    本报平壤7月20日电　记者徐宝康报道：汉城消息，美国国防部长切尼和南朝鲜“国防部长官”李相薰19日在华盛顿举行的“韩美年度保安会议”上，就美国军队继续留驻南朝鲜达成协议，并决定继续举行一年一度的“协作精神”联合军事演习。美国和南朝鲜这一举动遭到朝鲜人民强烈反对。
    据报道，在华盛顿举行的“韩美年度保安会议”上，切尼声称，4.3万美军继续驻扎在南朝鲜，是“两国政府和国民的愿望”。
    李相薰向美国政府转达了南朝鲜当局“希望美军继续留驻南朝鲜的立场”。
    美国防部长和南朝鲜“国防部长官”宣称，目前东北亚局势并不乐观，“加强美国和南朝鲜的军事同盟关系，是对付这种局势的必要的前提条件”。
    据报道，美方要求南朝鲜放弃联合生产战斗机的打算，转而直接向美国购买F—16或F—18战斗机。南朝鲜已同意美的这一要求。
