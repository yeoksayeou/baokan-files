	News publishing, broadcasting, television, culture, industry and commerce, and public security departments in Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province, have closely coordinated to severely crack down on illegal publishing activities. The once rampant illegal publishing trend has been curbed. Statistics show that the city has confiscated over 490 types and more than 10 million copies of illegal publications. It has investigated 23 illegal printing houses and arrested or detained 85 individuals involved in the illegal publishing, printing, selling, or renting of books and periodicals.

	In the crackdown on illegal publishing activities, Nanchang City has adopted a combination of blocking the flow and cutting off the source. It has comprehensively managed the editing, printing, distribution, and sales links. The relevant departments in the city have distributed a catalog of illegal publications to law enforcement personnel at all levels, ensuring that illegal publications are immediately seized as soon as they appear.
