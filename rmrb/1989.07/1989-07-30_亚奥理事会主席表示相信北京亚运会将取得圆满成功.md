The President of the Asian Olympic Council believes the Beijing Asian Games will be a resounding success

    BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) -- The latest issue of the overseas edition of "Outlook" magazine reports that Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, President of the Asian Olympic Council, recently told reporters in Kuwait that he is confident the 11th Asian Games, to be held in Beijing next year, will be a great success.

    He told reporters that the Asian Games are an important international competition, and hosting at least 36 delegations from various countries and regions is a formidable task. Organizing and hosting such an event requires not only the government's efforts but also the collective efforts of all Chinese people, especially the people of Beijing.

    Fahad told reporters that recently some countries have suggested to him that the 1990 Asian Games be moved to another country, but "I rejected this request because I believe China can solve its problems before the Asian Games."

    The 45-year-old President of the Asian Olympic Council pointed out that by then, no country or region will have any reason not to participate in the competition.

    He revealed to reporters that Kuwait will participate in 12-14 events at this Asian Games, including football, volleyball, basketball, gymnastics, fencing, boxing, table tennis, tennis, and golf. He said that although the sports teams participating in the competition have not yet been formed, training for each event is being intensified.

    Fahad told reporters that he will visit Beijing in August for an official visit and to observe the Asian handball competition. He predicted that the final match of this handball competition will be between the teams from China, South Korea, and Japan. During his visit, he will inspect the newly built sports facilities in the Beijing Asian Games Village and discuss various preparations for the Asian Games with the organizing committee.

    亚奥理事会主席表示相信北京亚运会将取得圆满成功
    新华社北京7月29日电　据刚出版的《瞭望》海外版第三十期报道，亚洲奥林匹克理事会主席谢赫·法哈德·艾哈迈德·萨巴赫，最近在科威特接受该杂志记者采访时说，他相信明年在北京举行的第十一届亚运会必将取得圆满成功。
    他告诉记者，亚运会是非常重要的国际比赛，接待来自各国和地区的至少36个代表团本身就是一项艰巨的工作。搞好组织接待工作，不仅靠政府的努力，而且要靠全体中国人民的努力，特别是北京市全体人民的努力。
    法哈德对记者说，最近有些国家向他提出建议，要求把1990年亚运会改在别国举行，但“我拒绝了这种要求，因为我相信中国能在亚运会以前解决问题”。
    这位45岁的亚奥理事会主席指出，届时任何国家和地区都没有理由不参加比赛。
    他向记者透露，科威特将参加本届亚运会足球、排球、篮球、体操、击剑、拳击、乒乓球、网球和高尔夫球等12—14个项目的比赛。他说，尽管参加比赛的运动队尚未成立，但各个项目的训练工作正在加紧进行。
    法哈德告诉记者，他将在8月份到北京进行正式访问，并察看亚洲手球比赛。他预言，这次手球比赛的最后角逐将在中国、南朝鲜和日本队之间进行。在访问期间，他将视察北京亚运村新建的体育设施，并同组委会讨论亚运会的各项准备工作。
