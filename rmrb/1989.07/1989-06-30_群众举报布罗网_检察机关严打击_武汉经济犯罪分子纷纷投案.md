    The public lays a trap network, prosecutors strike hard: Economic criminals in Wuhan surrender in droves

    WUHAN, June 30 (Xinhua) — The procuratorial organs in Wuhan have launched a powerful offensive against corruption, embezzlement, and bribery. By mid-June, they had arrested 160 criminals involved in these crimes and directly recovered 2.4 million yuan in illicit funds and goods. Many economic criminals have surrendered.

    Since the beginning of this year, the procuratorial organs in Wuhan have made the punishment of corruption, embezzlement, and bribery a key task. They have increased the number of economic prosecutors, strengthened their investigative capabilities, and had procurators at all levels personally participate in cases. They have also formed a network with supervisory, commercial, tax, and audit departments to jointly investigate major economic cases. From January to June, the number of embezzlement and bribery cases investigated was more than double that of the same period last year. Among the major cases investigated, four involved officials at the section chief level or above.

    Public reports are the main source of clues for combating embezzlement and bribery crimes. The procuratorial organs in Wuhan have actively rewarded those who provide effective reports and have protected the rights of informants, encouraging the public to actively fight against corruption. In the first five months of this year, the number of public reports received was 1,141, an increase of 8.5 times over the same period last year. Faced with public reports and the procuratorial organs' severe crackdown, criminals have surrendered in droves. In the past two months, 13 lawbreakers have surrendered, with embezzled and bribed funds totaling more than 130,000 yuan.
