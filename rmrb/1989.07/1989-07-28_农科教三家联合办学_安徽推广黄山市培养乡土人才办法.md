The collaboration between agricultural, scientific, and educational sectors to train local talent is "an effective method to significantly improve the cultural level of rural laborers and a good approach to cultivate a large number of rural technical talents," said Lu Rongsheng, Secretary of the Anhui Provincial Committee, after inspecting the "agricultural, scientific, and educational joint training method" pioneered by Huangshan City.

Recently, the Anhui Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government decided to promote this joint training method across the province and designated a number of prefectures and counties for further trials.

The so-called "agricultural, scientific, and educational joint training method" involves establishing vocational schools based on local economic development needs, offering different professional programs; organizing training classes and conducting various practical science and technology lectures; setting up farmers' cultural night schools to provide tiered literacy education. The agricultural, scientific, and educational sectors will provide professional instructors and hire various technical personnel to teach. Locally compiled textbooks and practical training bases will be used, integrating teaching, learning, and doing, with a focus on providing scientific and cultural education to laborers.

This training method was proposed by the Huangshan Municipal Committee and Municipal Government to address the long-standing issue of education focusing only on a small number of students advancing to high school and college, while neglecting the improvement of scientific and cultural literacy among rural laborers. After more than two years of practice in over 30 experimental sites across the city, this method was gradually enriched and improved in 1987.

Huangshan City, with a group of local technical talents, has accelerated the promotion of practical agricultural technologies. Several dozen practical technologies, such as hybrid rice seed production, comprehensive pest control, and optimized fertilizer application, which were previously difficult to popularize in the area, have now been basically disseminated to every household, achieving significant economic benefits.

    农科教三家联合办学
    安徽推广黄山市培养乡土人才办法
    据新华社合肥7月28日电  （记者沈祖润、纪成助）“这是一种大面积提高农村劳动者文化素质的好办法，是一条培养大批农村乡土技术人才的好路子。”安徽省委书记卢荣景考察了黄山市首创的“农科教联合办学法”后，作出了上述评价。
    最近，安徽省委、省政府决定在全省推广这种联合办学法，并确定一批地、县作进一步试验。
    所谓“农科教联合办学法”是，根据当地经济发展需要，兴办职业学校，开设学制不同的专业；举办培训班，开展各种实用科技讲座；开办农民文化夜校，分层次进行扫盲教育。并由农、科、教三家有授课能力的专业骨干和外聘各类技术人员担任教师。自编乡土教材，自建实习基地，实行教、学、做结合，着重对劳动者进行科学文化教育。
    这种办学法，是黄山市委、市政府为解决长期以来教育只重视培养极少数学生读高中、升大学，而忽视提高农村劳动者科技文化素质这一不合理现象而提出，并经过全市30多个试验点，两年多的实践，于1987年逐步充实完善起来的。
    黄山市由于有一支乡土技术人才，加快了农村实用科学技术的推广步伐。过去在当地难以普及的杂交水稻制种、病虫害综合防治、优化配方施肥等几十项实用技术，现已基本扩散到千家万户，取得了明显的经济效益。
