The naval fleet stationed in Hainan Special Economic Zone has seen its leading cadres set an example of integrity, refusing to accept bribes over 200 times in recent years.

This fleet is responsible for supporting the transportation across the Qiongzhou Strait. Some individuals in society have set their sights on the fleet's docks and ships, with some requesting to use the fleet's account numbers and names to establish companies and conduct business. Others have attempted to use various means to engage in illegal operations through the docks and ships. To eradicate corruption, the fleet's party committee has established a comprehensive set of regulations and institutions. These regulations stipulate that leading cadres are not allowed to engage in commercial activities, accept bribes, receive gifts, use their positions for personal gain, or attend banquets. They are to lead by example in upholding integrity and honesty.

Last year, someone used their connections to approach the fleet's political commissar, Liu Weidong, proposing to rent a ship and military vehicles for 50,000 yuan to transport a batch of polyethylene and rubber out of the island. Liu immediately refused the offer. The dock of the fleet's escort ship squadron is the only one in the vicinity that can accommodate large-tonnage cargo ships. Seeing this "ideal" location, some individuals tried to "buy their way in" with money. The leading cadres of the escort ship squadron remained unmoved by the money, refusing illegal transportation 17 times in one year. The director of the logistics department, Hou Xinming, discussed dozens of cooperation projects with domestic and foreign clients, refusing to accept bribes and "kickbacks" dozens of times. Last August, a local contractor wanted to undertake a project in the fleet and sent 100 grams of gold to Hou, who was in charge of the project. Hou immediately rebuked the contractor, and the cadres and soldiers praised him as a "man of integrity."

    建立规章制度　干部带头廉洁
    海南某舰艇部队拒贿二百多起
    新华社海口6月30日电　（通讯员陈盛、记者黄彩虹）海军驻海南特区某舰艇部队领导干部带头树立清廉之风，近几年拒绝接受贿赂200多起。
    这个部队承担支援琼州海峡的运输任务，社会上一些人看中了部队的码头、舰船，有的要求借用部队的帐号和名义办公司、做买卖；有的通过各种手段，想利用码头舰船进行非法经营活动。为了清除腐败现象，这个部队党委建立了一整套规章制度，规定领导干部不准参与经商，不准接受贿赂，不准收礼品，不准利用职权营私舞弊，不准赴宴席，带头树立清正廉洁新风。去年底，有人通过关系找到部队政委刘卫东，提出以5万元的运输费租用舰船和军车将一批聚乙烯和橡胶运送出岛，刘政委当场予以拒绝。这个部队护卫艇大队码头是附近地区唯一能停靠大吨位货船的码头，一些人看中这个“理想”位置，纷纷出钱“买路”。护卫艇大队领导干部不为金钱所动，一年中拒绝非法运输17次。后勤部部长侯新明与国内外客商洽谈合作项目几十项，先后几十次拒绝接受贿赂和“好处费”。去年8月，地方一个包工头想在部队承包一项工程，便送来100克黄金给负责这项工程的侯部长，当即受到了侯部长的斥责，干部战士称赞他是“一身正气的好部长。”
