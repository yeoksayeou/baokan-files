I once heard painters or photographers argue: "I paint what I cannot photograph," or "I photograph what I cannot paint." They emphasized the need to develop their own subjectivity and explore unique themes and styles.

Poets were delighted to hear this: they could sing about what painters could not paint and what photographers could not capture.

For example, Li Bai's "Hearing of Wang Changling's Demotion to Luling":
	When the willow flowers fall and the cuckoo cries,
	I hear that you have passed through five rivers to Luling.
	I send my worried heart with the bright moon,
	Following the wind to the west of Yelang.

This poem expresses Li Bai's deep concern and friendship upon hearing of Wang Changling's demotion to Luling (in present-day Hunan). It presents a vast, dynamic, three-dimensional scene of a moonlit night of longing for a friend.

Another example is Li Bai's "Farewell to Meng Haoran at Yellow Crane Tower":
	An old friend bids farewell at Yellow Crane Tower,
	In the third month of flowers and smoke, heading to Yangzhou.
	The solitary sail disappears into the vast blue sky,
	Only the long river flows to the horizon.

Faced with such a scene, painters and photographers could only depict Li Bai and Meng Haoran bidding farewell at Yellow Crane Tower or Meng Haoran boarding a solitary boat, setting sail eastward, while Li Bai looks on. Poets, however, can encompass space, time (including seasons), near and far views, stillness and motion all at once, achieving a remarkably concise effect.

Du Fu, a contemporary of Li Bai, praised Li Bai's poetry: "Li Bai's poetry is unrivaled, his thoughts are free and unconstrained." Later generations summarized Li Bai's style as "free and unconstrained." How this style was formed has not been discussed by previous scholars. After reading these two poems by Li Bai, one can understand: the so-called "free and unconstrained" style is actually the sense of motion and three-dimensionality (especially in the third and fourth lines) that gives readers a feeling of ethereal detachment and carefree elegance, forming a unique aesthetic.

This "free and unconstrained" style is not easily achieved by the works of ordinary painters or photographers, nor is it commonly seen in the works of many poets contemporary with or after Li Bai. It is a style uniquely created by Li Bai.

If we further discuss Li Bai's "Departing from Baidi in the Morning":
	In the morning, I bid farewell to Baidi among the colorful clouds,
	In one day, I return to Jiangling a thousand miles away.
	The cries of monkeys on both banks do not cease,
	The light boat has already passed through countless mountains.

This poem further solidifies the reader's impression of Li Bai's "free and unconstrained" style, characterized by a sense of three-dimensionality and motion, which is something painters cannot paint and photographers cannot capture.

These three poems by Li Bai, the first two about friends, express concern and farewell; the third about himself, expresses joy and surprise. These emotions are common themes for poets throughout history. However, Li Bai's ability to express them with such a strong sense of motion and three-dimensionality, while remaining lively and natural without any trace of artificiality, is rare.

Traditionally, critics have praised Li Bai for his skill in writing five- and seven-word songs, which is indeed accurate. However, his use of the same style in writing quatrains has not been noted. Li Bai's representative songs are full of motion and three-dimensionality, giving readers a sense of soaring freely and carefree elegance. The Tang poet He Zhizhang, upon first meeting Li Bai, called him "a fallen immortal," and later generations further referred to him as the "poet immortal." These are not arbitrary nicknames but are closely related to the free and unconstrained style of his songs and quatrains.

The Tang songs are similar to free verse in modern poetry, while regulated verse (Tang's quatrains and octaves) is similar to formal verse in modern poetry. It is easier for poets to write free verse songs in a free and unconstrained style; writing regulated verse in a free and unconstrained style is more difficult. However, in Li Bai's hands, whether songs or quatrains, they all appear ethereal and unconstrained, without the flaws of stiffness and rigidity, but with a fresh, natural, and carefree prose beauty, showcasing his unique free and unconstrained style. In modern poetry, free verse often suffers from a lack of conciseness, leading to a scattered style; however, concise free verse can avoid this scattered style and transform into prose beauty. As for formal verse in modern poetry, it often appears stiff, and prose beauty is even rarer. Even with a sense of motion or three-dimensionality, it is difficult to form an aesthetic. In this regard, modern poets can learn from Li Bai's quatrains, absorbing beneficial nutrients.

    新诗的凝练与散文化
    ——从李白的飘逸诗风谈起
    吴奔星
    曾听画家或摄影家如此争辩：“我画我所不能摄者”，或“我摄我所不能画者”。他们表明要发扬各自的主体意识，探索创新的独特的题材与风格。
    诗家闻而大喜：他既能吟咏画家所不能画者，又能吟咏摄影家所难于摄者。
    如李白《闻王昌龄左迁龙标》：
    杨花落尽子规啼，闻道龙标过五溪。
    我寄愁心与明月，随风直到夜郎西。
    这是李白听说王昌龄贬谪龙标（在今湖南乾阳）尉时，所抒发的无比友好与深切关注的内心世界，展现出一幅辽阔的动态的立体的月夜思友图。
    又如李白《黄鹤楼送孟浩然之广陵》：
    故人西辞黄鹤楼，烟花三月下扬州。
    孤帆远影碧空尽，唯见长江天际流。
    面向如此情景，画家与摄影家只能画出或摄取李白与孟浩然在黄鹤楼头饯别或孟夫子登上孤舟，扬帆东去，而李白则翘首遥望的情景；诗家则能连同空间、时间（包括季节）、近景、远景、静态、动态一揽子概括无遗，达到了令人惊奇的精练地步。
    杜甫是李白的诗友，曾称赞李白的诗：“白也诗无敌，飘然思不群。”后人据此把李白的诗风归结为“飘逸”。这种诗风究竟如何形成，前人尚未触及。读了李白这两首七绝，似可恍然：所谓“飘逸”实际是李白诗中的行动感与立体感（特别是诗的三四两句）所给予读者的空灵超脱、潇洒出尘的美感所形成的。这种“飘逸”的风格不仅一般画家或摄影家的产品所难于显示，也是与李白同时或其后的许多诗人的作品所罕见的，这是李白所独创的诗风。
    如果再谈谈李白的《早发白帝城》：
    朝辞白帝彩云间，千里江陵一日还。
    两岸猿声啼不住，轻舟已过万重山。便更能巩固读者对形成李白“飘逸”诗风的立体感与行动感的整体印象，确是画家所不能画，摄影家所不能摄的。
    李白这三首七绝，头两首写友人，抒发关怀和惜别之情；第三首写自己，抒发喜出望外之情。这两种感情，是古今诗人所经常触及的，然而像李白这样写得如此有行动感和立体感而又活泼自然不留斧凿痕的，却不多见。
    向来评李白者，认为他所擅长的是五七言歌行，这自然是切合实际的，但对李白以他写歌行的笔法写绝句，却未之前闻。李白的一些有代表性的歌行，是充满行动或与立体感的给人以天马行空、潇洒出尘的印象。盛唐诗人贺知章初会李白便称他为“谪仙”，后人又进一步呼之为“诗仙”，都不是随心所欲地加给他的诨名或绰号，而是与他歌行绝句中的行动或与立体感的构成的飘逸诗风紧密地联系在一起的。
    唐人的歌行相当于新诗中的自由诗，而近体诗（唐人律绝）则相当新诗中的格律诗。诗人要把自由诗的歌行写得飘逸，比较容易一些；要把格律诗的律绝写得飘逸，就比较难。但在李白的笔下，无论歌行或绝句，都显得空灵活脱，而无板滞、拘泥之弊，却有一种清新、自然、洒脱流畅的散文美，以显示他独特的飘逸的诗风。新诗中的自由诗，因语言欠精练，往往出现散文化的毛病；而写得精练的自由诗，却能避免散文化而转化为散文美。至于新诗中的格律诗，大多显得呆滞，具有散文美的更为难得，虽有行动感或与立体感都难于构成美感。在这一方面新诗人是不妨消化李白的一些绝句，从中吸取有益的营养的。
