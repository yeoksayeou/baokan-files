On April 14, 1989, the Chinese government announced: China's population has reached 1.1 billion, doubling since 1949. The population alarm bell is ringing in the ears of every Chinese person!

However, on the same day, in Jin Qian Village, He Zhou Town, Qi Dong County, Hunan Province, the village party branch secretary, Xu Jiachao, announced: The village's population has decreased by 69 people since 1979, and the per capita arable land has increased by 0.09 mu since 1978.

In contemporary China, the key to population explosion lies in the uncontrolled birth rates in rural areas. Incredibly, in this small mountain village, a unique phenomenon has emerged: negative population growth!

The Legend of the "Gold-Shitting Stone"

In Jin Qian Village, there is an ancient legend: The village has a Jin Qian Temple, behind which lies a "gold-shitting stone" that excretes a gold coin every day. The village is inhabited by Xu and Lei surnamed villagers who live comfortably. Later, as the two surnames rapidly multiplied, the gold coins were no longer enough, and the powerful Xu surname villagers monopolized the "gold-shitting stone." The Lei surname villagers, in a fit of anger, moved the stone at night, and it never excreted gold again. Since then, the villagers of Jin Qian Village have been poor generation after generation.

Though this is a legend, it contains profound wisdom.

Jin Qian Village is located in a purple shale region with barren land that is prone to flooding and drought. After liberation, although the Party and government vigorously supported Jin Qian Village in developing production, due to the extremely poor natural conditions, the village relied on state subsidies for grain and loans for money. Jin Qian Village also has a folk song: "Born in Jin Qian, a sea of suffering; not blaming the cadres, but the conditions." During the collectivization period, farmers, in order to earn work points, gave birth to as many children as possible, with some having three to five children and others having seven or eight. Meanwhile, cadres did not enforce family planning policies, and some even led by example in having more children. By 1978, the population had surged to 661, reducing the per capita arable land to 0.75 mu, with per capita grain rationing at only 182 kilograms and per capita income at 68.4 yuan. Someone changed the folk song to: "Born in Jin Qian, a sea of suffering; blaming both the cadres and the conditions."

The Crucial Cut

In 1975, Xu Jiachao, who had served in the army for seven years, returned to his hometown after being demobilized. He saw that the village's appearance had not changed, except for the addition of a large number of malnourished children, and his heart was heavy. Xu Jiachao tossed and turned, unable to sleep. When would the appearance of his hometown change? How could it be changed? He recalled the scene of his unit stationed in a certain place in Guizhou: Although the land there was barren, the population was small, the sowing area was large, the income was considerable, and the people lived comfortably. His heart suddenly became clear: "To make Jin Qian Village shake off poverty, the first priority is to control the population growth!"

In early 1978, Xu Jiachao was elected as the village party branch secretary. At the first branch meeting, he proposed: "Those with more than two children should all be sterilized." Some comrades said: "Sterilizing after the second child, there's no document from above, and surrounding villages haven't done it. You've just taken office, can this first shot be fired?" Xu Jiachao said: "To shake off the poverty of a thousand years, this shot must be fired! As long as we branch members lead the way, this shot will definitely be fired!" He then convened a branch meeting, a village cadre meeting, and did ideological work among party members and cadres.

At that time, Xu Jiachao's second child was only three months old, weighing only 3.5 jin. Someone said: "Xu Jiachao isn't afraid of dying out?" Xu Jiachao resolutely went under the knife first. When the anesthetic was injected, it had no effect. The sterilization candidates and relatives waiting in the hospital secretly rejoiced: If the secretary can't operate, we're off the hook! Xu Jiachao was anxious and repeatedly begged the doctor to operate. The doctor said that a stronger anesthetic would have to be injected, but the family members would have to sign. Xu Jiachao took the pen and said: "I'll sign myself!" Then, the village and group cadres went under the knife one by one, followed by the masses, and 20 people were sterilized in one day.

"The More People, the Stronger" No Longer Works

The Jin Qian Village party branch clearly saw that the vicious cycle of "the poorer, the more children; the more children, the poorer" mainly came from the deeply rooted traditional concepts of "many children, many blessings" and "not being filial has three aspects, the greatest being no descendants, the more people, the stronger" among the villagers. The most fundamental thing was to help the masses change this concept. To this end, they widely carried out activities among all cadres and villagers to calculate the mutual relationship between population, land, and grain.

In 1968, the entire village had a population of 535, with 0.96 mu of arable land per person, a total grain output of 143,000 kilograms, and 268 kilograms of grain per person. In 1978, the population increased to 661, with only 0.75 mu of arable land per person, a total grain output of 238,000 kilograms, and 360 kilograms of grain per person. Over 10 years, the increase in per capita grain was less than half the increase in total grain output, obviously, the grain increased in the fields was mostly eaten by the new population. Moreover, the increase in grain output was limited, and the arable land could not be increased. If the population growth was not controlled like before 1978, in another three or four 10-year periods, the per capita arable land would be less than one fen. After such calculations, the villagers realized that if they clung to the traditional concept of childbearing and rushed to have children, in the end, there would be no land to till and no grain to eat, and they felt a sense of crisis and urgency.

Another tactic the village party branch used to help the masses change their childbearing concepts was to conduct typical comparisons. The wealthiest households in the village were those with only one child and those with few children. In 1988, 16 households with only one child had a per capita net income of 1,250 yuan, more than double the village average. Young Xu Jinyu, after undergoing sterilization surgery, entered an illiteracy class and learned scientific poultry, pig, and fish farming techniques at the village vocational school. In 1988, her family's per capita net income reached 1,300 yuan. She deeply felt: "If my mother had given birth to five or six children, crying and shouting, and couldn't even manage the housework, where would there be time to learn culture and science, and how could we get rich?" In contrast, some households with many children are still poor. Fifty-seven-year-old farmer Xu Lizu had five children in a row. Due to the heavy burden of many people, although the couple worked day and night, they still had not repaid the 100-plus kilograms of borrowed rice, and three of their children had not yet gotten married. Some households with many children sighed: "Family planning should have been implemented earlier!"

In Jin Qian Village, the concept of "the more people, the stronger" no longer holds. The village has formulated a series of regulations that do not allow the ridicule and bullying of households with only one child or few children. Villager Xiao Yigui quarreled with Xiao Jinyuan, who only had one daughter, and Xiao Yigui called her a "barren hen." The village fined Xiao Yigui 40 yuan, screened a movie, and had him make a public apology to the villagers before the screening. Villager Xu Licai and Xu Dingxiang had a dispute over the construction of their house foundations. Xu Licai and his six family members, relying on their strength in numbers, made unreasonable demands, which were rejected, so they chased and beat Xu Dingxiang. Village cadres immediately intervened, fined Xu Licai 40 yuan, and ordered him to write 10 letters of apology to be distributed to each group.

Currently, the state has not legislated on family planning, and some places have formulated village rules and regulations, but due to poor implementation, they often become mere pieces of paper. However, Jin Qian Village enforces the regulations without compromise.

Enviable Treatment

In May of this year, the county family planning commission organized a "peasant family planning symposium" in Jin Qian Village. Someone asked Liu Jiaosheng, who had only one daughter and was sterilized, "You only had one daughter and were sterilized. Don't you regret it? Who will take care of you in your old age?" Liu Jiaosheng smiled and said: "I don't regret it! When I was sterilized, I also eyed the village's 850 yuan reward. I used this money as capital to open a retail store. Later, I made money and developed animal husbandry. Last year, I raised 110 pigs using the fast pig-raising method, all of which were sold, earning a net profit of 12,000 yuan. I deposited the money in the bank to use when I get old. Besides, the village will take care of me when I get old!"

The Jin Qian Village party branch has formulated a series of measures to give households with only one child and five-guarantee elderly people enviable treatment and meticulous care, solving the worries of family planning.

For those who are sterilized after one child, the town and village reward 850 yuan in cash. For those who receive a certificate of only one child, double portions of responsibility land and homestead land are allocated, and the basic construction fee for farmland, homestead land land price, and nursery fees for only one child are exempted.

The village has set a care standard for five-guarantee households: Their living conditions must be better than those of ordinary households with children. Each village production team allocates 350-425 kilograms of rice, 60 yuan of living expenses, 2 sets of single clothes per year, 1 piece of cotton clothing every 3 years, and 1 quilt every 5 years to each elderly person. They arrange for voluntary labor to chop firewood for the elderly, send 100 kilograms of coal for heating every winter, and when distributing fish from the pond, they first pick the largest one to send to the elderly. When the village installs high-voltage power lines, they first connect the electricity to the elderly's homes and install fluorescent lights to prevent damage to the elderly's vision. Every Spring Festival, the village and group send pork and white sugar to the elderly. On New Year's Eve, village cadres first visit the five-guarantee elderly to ensure their living arrangements are in order before they can rest assured to return home for the reunion. On the first day of the New Year, village cadres first pay New Year's greetings to the five-guarantee elderly and households with only one child, and then to their own parents. On major birthdays, the village screens a movie to celebrate. When the elderly fall ill, they arrange for someone to take care of them, and the medical expenses are fully covered by the group. When the elderly pass away, the village handles all the funeral arrangements.

At the symposium, nearly 70-year-old five-guarantee elderly Tang Yangxiu said: "I have no children, but I live better than some people with children!" Another elderly person, Xu Taomai, said: "She speaks the truth. Some elderly people with children not only live worse than five-guarantee elderly people but also often suffer from their children's mistreatment."

"The Three-None" Village

Now, in Jin Qian Village, the family planning work, known as the "most difficult in the world," is no longer a difficult task. Of the 111 couples of childbearing age in the village, except for 7 couples who were approved to have children, the rest have all adopted sterilization and contraception measures. The village has achieved a "three-none" situation of 11 consecutive years without multiple births, 8 years without early marriage and childbearing, and 3 years without out-of-plan childbearing. Per capita grain has increased from 360 kilograms in 1978 to 670 kilograms in 1988, and per capita net income has increased from 68.4 yuan in 1978 to 526 yuan in 1988. Seventy percent of the village's households have built new houses. School-age children are all enrolled in school, with none dropping out midway. Old farmer Lei Longfa changed the folk song to: "Jin Qian, Jin Qian, fame well-deserved, with the Party's leadership, happiness for ten thousand years!"

    山村人口负增长的奥秘
    ——金钱村计划生育工作纪实
    刘金桐　彭期龙
    1989年4月14日，中国政府宣布：中国人口已达11亿，比1949年翻了一番。人口警钟在每个中国人耳畔震响！
    然而，也就在同一天，在湖南省祁东县河州镇金钱村，村党支部书记许家朝宣布：全村人口比1979年减少69人，人均耕地比1978年增加0.09亩。
    当代中国人口膨胀，关键在于农村生育失控。不可思议的是，在这个小山村，却出现了一种奇特的现象：人口负增长！
              “屙金石”的传说
    在金钱村，有一个古老的传说：村里有一个金钱寺，寺后有一块“屙金石”，每天屙出一颗金子。村里住着许、雷两姓村民，生活过得宽裕。后来两姓迅速繁衍，金子已不够用，人多势众的许姓村民就把“屙金石”独占了。雷姓村民一气之下，趁夜搬开石头，它再也不屙金子了。从此，金钱村村民就世世代代受穷。
    这虽是传说，却蕴含着深刻的哲理。
    金钱村属紫色页岩地区，土地贫瘠，易涝易旱。解放后，党和政府虽然大力扶持金钱村发展生产，可由于自然条件太差，年年吃粮靠统销，用钱靠贷款。金钱村又流传一首歌谣：“生在金钱，苦海无边；不怪干部，只怨条件”。集体化时，农民为要劳力挣工分，拚命生孩子，少的三五个，多的七八个。而干部对计划生育工作抓得不力，有的甚至带头超生。到1978年，人口猛增到661人，人均耕地减少到0.75亩，人均口粮只有182公斤，人均收入只有68.4元。有人又把歌谣改成：“生在金钱，苦海无边，既怪干部，又怨条件。”
              关键的一刀
    1975年，当了七年兵的许家朝从部队复员回到家乡。他看到村貌依旧，唯一变化的是增加了一大堆面黄肌瘦的孩子，心情十分沉重。许家朝辗转反侧，夜不能眠。家乡的面貌何时才能改变？怎样去改变？他想起部队驻扎的贵州某地的情景：那里土地虽然贫瘠，但人口少，播种面积大，收入可观，群众生活宽裕。他心里豁然开朗：“要使金钱村摆脱贫困，第一要紧的是控制人口的增长！”
    1978年初，许家朝当选为村党支部书记，在第一次支委会上就提出：凡有两个孩子以上的一律结扎。有的同志说：“二胎结扎，上边没文件，周围的村都没搞，你刚上任，这第一炮能不能打响？”许家朝说：“为了摆脱千百年来的贫困，这一炮一定要打响！只要我们支委带头，这一炮也一定能打响！”他接着召开支部大会、村组干部会，做党员、干部的思想工作。
    当时，许家朝生下的第二个孩子才三个月，体重只有3斤半。有人说：“他许家朝就不怕断子绝孙？”许家朝毅然第一个上了手术台。当注射麻醉剂时，药不起效。等在医院的结扎对象和亲属暗中庆幸：如支书开不成刀，我们就免了！许家朝急了，再三恳求医生动刀。医生说要注射药力更强的麻醉剂，但要家属签字。许家朝拿起笔，说：“我自己签！”接着，村组干部依次上了手术台，随后群众一一跟上，一天之间就结扎了20个。
              “人多逞强”不灵了
    金钱村党支部清醒地看到，“越穷越生，越生越穷”这种恶性循环的出现，主要来自于村民中根深蒂固的“多子多福”和“不孝有三、无后为大、人多势众”的传统观念，最根本的是要帮助群众转变这一观念。为此，他们在全村干部群众中广泛开展算人口、土地、粮食相互关系帐的活动。
    1968年全村人口535人，人均耕地0.96亩，粮食总产14.3万公斤，人均占有粮食268公斤；1978年，人口增加到661人，人均耕地只有0.75亩，粮食总产增加到23.8万公斤，人均占有粮食360公斤。10年间，人均占有粮食的增长幅度不到粮食总产增长幅度的一半，显然，地里增产的粮食大都被新增的人口吃掉了。况且，粮食增长幅度是有限的，耕地则不能再增加，如果像1978年以前那样不控制人口增长，再过三四个10年，人均耕地就不足一分了。这样一算帐，村民明白了如果守着传统的生育观念不放，抢着生孩子，到头来就会无地可耕、无粮可食，心中产生了一种危机感、紧迫感。
    村党支部帮助群众转变生育观念的另一招是进行典型对比。全村富得最快的是独生子女户和少子女户，16个独生子女户去年人均纯收入达1250元，比全村人均水平高出一倍多。青年许金玉做了结扎手术后，进了扫盲学习班，又在村里技校学会了科学养鸡、养猪、养鱼技术，去年全家人均纯收入达1300元。她深有体会地说：“要是像我娘生五六个孩子，哭的哭，喊的喊，连家务都忙不赢，哪有时间学文化、学科学，哪能脱贫致富呢？”与此相反，村里有些多子女户，至今尚未脱贫。57岁的老农许立武一连生了5个孩子，由于人多负担重，尽管夫妻俩没日没夜地干活，至今还有借的100多公斤稻谷没还清，还有3个儿女没钱结婚。一些多子女户深有感触地说：“计划生育早点搞就好了！”
    在金钱村，“人多逞强”的观念如今也没有市场了。村里制订了一系列不准侮辱欺压独生子女户、少子女户的规定。村民肖以贵与只有一个女孩的肖金元吵嘴，肖以贵骂她是“没崽鸡婆”。村里罚了肖以贵40元钱，放了一场电影，叫他在映前向群众作公开检讨。村民许立财和许定祥为建房基地发生争论，许立财父子6人仗着人多拳头硬之势，提出无理要求，受到拒绝后便追打许定祥。村干部立即出面制止，对许立财除处以罚款40元外，还责令写出检讨书10份，发到各组。
    目前，国家对计划生育尚未立法，一些地方制订了村规民约，但由于未执行好，往往成为一纸空文。而金钱村执行规约却是寸步不让。
              令人眼红的待遇
    今年5月，县计划生育委员会在金钱村组织了一次“农民计划生育座谈会”，有人问独女户刘交生：“你只生一个女儿就结扎了，不后悔么？谁来给你养老送终呢？”刘交生笑道：“不后悔！我当年结扎，眼红村里那850元奖金，也是一个因素呢！我用这笔钱做头本，开代销店。后来赚了钱，发展养殖业。去年用快速养猪法养猪110头，全部出栏，净赚12000元。我把钱都存到银行去，到老了才用。再说，老了还有村里照顾咧！”
    金钱村党支部制订了一系列措施，对独生子女户和五保老人给予令人艳羡的待遇和周密的照顾，解决了计划生育的后顾之忧。
    凡一胎结扎的，镇里、村里奖给现金850元。凡领取独生子女证的，划给双份责任田和宅基地，免收独生子女的农田基本建设工费、宅基地地皮费、托幼费等。
    村里给五保户定了个照顾标准：生活必须超过一般有儿有女户的水平。村民小组每年配给每个老人稻谷350—425公斤，生活费60元；1年2套单衣，3年1件棉衣，5年1床棉被；安排义务工为老人砍柴，每年冬天送给100公斤烤火煤；干塘分鱼，先挑一条最大的给老人送去；村里架高压电线，先接通老人家中的电灯，并全部安装日光灯，以免影响老人的视力。每到春节，村、组给老人送去猪肉、白糖。大年三十，村干部先到五保老人家看望，把他们的生活安排妥贴后，才放心回家团圆。大年初一，村干部先给五保老人和独生子女户拜年，再给自己父母拜年。每逢大寿，村里送一场电影祝贺。老人生了病，安排专人照料，医药费由组里全包。老人去世，丧事全由村里操办。
    在座谈会上，年近古稀的五保老人唐阳秀说：“我没崽没女，比有些有崽有女的人家过得还好呢！”另一老人许桃妹说：“她说的是实话。有些有崽有女的老人不但生活不如五保老人，还得常受儿女们的气。”
                “三无”村
    如今，在金钱村，被称为“天下第一难”的计划生育工作在这里再也不是件难事。村里111对育龄夫妇除7对经批准生育外，其余全部采取了绝育、节育措施。全村出现了连续11年无多胎生育，8年无早婚早育，3年无计划外生育的“三无”局面，人均占有粮食由1978年的360公斤增加到1988年的670公斤，人均纯收入由1978年的68.4元增加到1988年的526元。全村70％的农户建了新房。学龄儿童全部入学，无一中途退学。老农雷隆发又将歌谣改为：“金钱金钱，名不虚传，有党领导，幸福万年！”
