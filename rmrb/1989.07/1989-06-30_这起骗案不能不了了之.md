In July 1988, our company's business development department signed a contract with the Hunan Provincial Commerce Company for 5,000 tons of aluminum ingots. We were defrauded out of more than 4 million yuan.

Because the relevant companies involved in this case are provincial-level companies, although the relevant departments have looked into the matter, the problem has not been resolved. Our company dares not speak out in anger. We hope that the relevant departments will prioritize national interests, thoroughly investigate this matter, recover the economic losses, and not let this case be swept under the rug.

    这起骗案不能不了了之
    1988年7月，我们公司经营开发部与湖南省商贸公司签订了一笔5000吨的铝锭合同，被骗走400多万元。
    由于这一案件牵涉的有关公司是省级公司，因此，有关单位虽然过问了此事，但问题并没有解决，我们公司也敢怒不敢言。希望有关部门以国家利益为重，彻底调查此事，挽回经济损失，不能让这一案件不了了之。
