    Jilin's trade with the Soviet Union has made significant progress this year. By the end of June, the province had signed barter trade contracts worth 1.85 billion Swiss francs with the Soviet Union, more than doubling the total contract value from the previous year.

    Jilin's border trade with the Soviet Union began in 1987. At the beginning of this year, various border trade companies in Jilin Province established multi-level trade partnerships with the Soviet side. At the same time, they improved transportation conditions and increased the volume of goods passing through. Now, the number of export items to the Soviet Union has increased from a dozen to nearly a hundred. The export commodities have shifted from raw materials and primary products to deeply processed, high-value products.

    新华社长春7月10日电　（记者高欣）今年以来，吉林省对苏边境贸易取得进展。到6月底，与苏联签订的易货贸易合同金额达1.85亿瑞士法郎，比上年全年合同总额增加1倍多。
    吉林省对苏边境贸易始于1987年。今年初，吉林省各边贸公司与苏方建立多层次的贸易伙伴关系，同时改善运输条件，增加过货量。现在，全省对苏出口品种已由过去的十几种增加到近百种。出口商品由原料型初级产品向深加工、高价值产品转化。
