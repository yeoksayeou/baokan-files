Najibullah Tells Pakistani Journalists That Afghanistan Can Become a Demilitarized Zone

According to reports from this location, Kabul regime President Najibullah stated that as long as the two superpowers and neighboring Pakistan do not interfere in Afghanistan's internal affairs, and Afghanistan's territory, sovereignty, and independence are guaranteed, this country can become a demilitarized zone.

It is reported that Najibullah made these remarks while meeting with a delegation of Pakistani journalists visiting Afghanistan at the presidential palace in Kabul. He suggested that an international conference should be convened, with direct or indirect participants in the Afghan issue, including the United States, the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Iran, India, and Saudi Arabia. He also said that after Afghanistan becomes a demilitarized zone, Pakistan's northwestern region will be permanently secure and reliable.

Najibullah further stated that it is time to say "goodbye" to war. He praised Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's views on politically resolving the Afghan issue but complained that Pakistan's Afghanistan policy had not changed much. He claimed that the basic points of his national reconciliation policy are:

	- Complete ceasefire;
	- Ensuring lasting peace;
	- Forming a broad-based government representing various political forces, with these political parties engaging in dialogue;
	- Drafting a new constitution and holding elections under the provisions of the new constitution.

    纳吉布拉对巴基斯坦记者表示
    阿富汗可以成为非军事区
    本报伊斯兰堡7月10日电  记者任毓骏报道：据此间消息，喀布尔政权总统纳吉布拉说，只要两个超级大国以及邻邦巴基斯坦不干涉阿富汗内部事务，阿富汗的领土、主权和独立得到保证，这个国家可以成为非军事区。
    据报道，纳吉布拉是在喀布尔总统府接见访阿的巴基斯坦记者代表团时说这番话的。他建议说，应该召开一次由直接或间接参与阿富汗问题国家参加的国际会议，这些国家应包括美国、苏联、巴基斯坦、伊朗、印度和沙特阿拉伯。他还说，阿富汗成为非军事区后，巴基斯坦的西北方将永远安全可靠。
    纳吉布拉还说，现在是应该和战争说“再见”的时候了。他赞赏巴基斯坦总理贝·布托关于政治解决阿富汗问题的见解，但又抱怨巴基斯坦政府的阿富汗政策没有多大改变。他声称他的民族和解政策的基本点是：
    ——全面实行停火；
    ——保证持久和平；
    ——组建一个基础广泛、代表各派政治力量的政府、由这些政治党派开展对话；
    ——起草一部新宪法并在新宪法规定的条文下进行选举。
