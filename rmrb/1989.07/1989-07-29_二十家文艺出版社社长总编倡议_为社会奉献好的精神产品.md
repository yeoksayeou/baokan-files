Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 28th. (Reporter Chi Maohua) The editors-in-chief and general editors of 20 local literary publishing houses across the country recently concluded their first work seminar in Taiyuan, issuing a call to invigorate spirits, overcome difficulties, and contribute quality spiritual products to society.

The attendees agreed that it is crucial and urgent to guide thoughts and values in line with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. To this end, they issued a call to all literary publishing houses and the publishing industry nationwide.

The call states: First, maintain self-respect. Correct the publishing direction, with a strong sense of the times and mission, respect and value oneself, consciously become creators, accumulators, and disseminators of spiritual wealth, and never be the makers or sellers of spiritual opium; second, practice self-discipline. Uphold the country's laws and regulations, the Party's propaganda discipline, and socialist moral norms, strictly discipline oneself, be clean and upright, and serve the public. Do not follow trends, cater to vulgar tastes, or seek personal gain. Do not engage in bourgeois liberalization, nor allow bourgeois decadent thoughts and various feudal dregs to resurface and pollute society; third, strive for self-improvement. In the face of economic difficulties in the publishing industry and the challenges posed by illegal publications and vulgar periodicals, one can only strive for self-improvement and not succumb to decline.

    二十家文艺出版社社长总编倡议
    为社会奉献好的精神产品
    据新华社太原7月28日电  （记者池茂花）全国20家地方文艺出版社的社长、总编辑日前在太原结束的首届工作研讨会上倡议：要振奋精神，克服困难为社会奉献好的精神产品。
    与会同志认为，以党的十三届四中全会精神为指导，端正思想指向和价值指向，在当前尤为重要和迫切。为此，他们向全国文艺出版社及出版界发出倡议。
    倡议说：一要自重。端正出版方向，以强烈的时代意识和使命感自尊自重，自觉地当好精神财富的创造者、积累者、传播者，决不做精神鸦片的炮制者、贩卖者；二要自律。以国家的法律、法规，党的宣传纪律和社会主义道德规范，严以律己，清廉自守，克己奉公，决不随波逐流，趋时媚俗，唯利是图。自身不搞资产阶级自由化，也不让资产阶级腐朽思想和形形色色的封建糟粕沉渣泛起，污染社会；三要自强。面对出版界所遇到的经济困难及非法出版物、庸俗书刊的挑战，只能自强，不能自甘沦落。
