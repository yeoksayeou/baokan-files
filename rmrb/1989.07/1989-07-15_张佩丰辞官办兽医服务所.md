	Zhang Peifeng, the deputy mayor of Nanfeng Township in Anxin County, Hebei Province, voluntarily resigned from his position to establish a veterinary service center for livestock and poultry. He has used his expertise to promote the development of the duck farming industry in the entire county.

	Zhang Peifeng, a graduate of the Department of Veterinary Medicine at Beijing Agricultural University, has over 20 years of experience in livestock and poultry disease prevention and control. However, after becoming the deputy mayor, he was overwhelmed with administrative duties and found it difficult to fully utilize his professional skills.

    张佩丰辞官办兽医服务所
    据新华社石家庄7月15日电  河北省安新县南冯乡副乡长张佩丰自愿辞“官”，办起了畜禽兽医服务所，用其所长促进了全县养鸭业的发展。
    毕业于北京农业大学兽医系的张佩丰，有20多年的畜禽防疫工作经验。但当了副乡长后，事务缠身，难发挥所长。去年9月，他毅然辞官，办起了畜禽兽医服务所。
    去年白洋淀地区禽霍乱流行，为搞好防疫灭病，他走乡串户，为10万多只鸭子注射了疫苗，并指导饲养户用药。
