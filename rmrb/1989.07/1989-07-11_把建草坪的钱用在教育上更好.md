Recently, the news media in Urumqi City has continuously reported that the municipal government, in order to increase green spaces and beautify the city, has decided to transform the city's largest People's Square into a lawn. This has sparked some of my thoughts.

I fully agree that this desert-like border city needs more green spaces, so that citizens can take a stroll on the lawn after work or meals. However, I recall that the municipal government has also issued a call for donations to education. Education is crucial to the rise and fall of a nation, and it is only natural that every individual should take responsibility. But when these two issues arise simultaneously, it becomes puzzling: education funds are lacking, and citizens are asked to donate; yet the municipal government can still allocate a large sum of money to renovate a square that is already quite satisfactory! Let's take a look at what this project entails: removing a thick layer of concrete, bringing in large amounts of soil and fertilizer, laying down sod, constructing fences, assigning people to maintain it, and then every year spending a considerable amount on upkeep. From this perspective, Urumqi City is not lacking in funds; it just doesn't want to spend the money on education.

As residents living among towering buildings, who wouldn't want more refreshing greenery around? However, at present, we cannot reach such a level of detachment: while we lie on soft lawns enjoying the warm sunshine, we can't bear to see our children or younger siblings studying in dilapidated, dangerous buildings. In a provincial capital, seeing dilapidated school buildings coexist with a beautifully adorned square, I do not believe this stark contrast will receive praise for spiritual civilization. One thing I am sure of: the funds for renovating People's Square have already been allocated separately. Therefore, as an ordinary citizen who cares about both education and urban construction, I appeal: please use this money for education!

### 把建草坪的钱用在教育上更好

    把建草坪的钱用在教育上更好
    新疆维吾尔自治区劳动人事厅　赵枫林
    最近，乌鲁木齐市新闻媒介接连传来消息：市政府为了增加绿地，美化城市，决定把市区最大的人民广场改建成草坪，这引发了我的一番感慨。
    我非常赞同这个遍地灰黄的边城增加一些绿地，市民们能在工余饭后，在草坪上散步。然而，我想起市政府还发出一个号召：为教育捐款。教育关系到国家兴衰，自然匹夫有责。但这两件事同时出现，就让人百思不得其解了：教育经费缺乏，要市民捐助；而市政府竟还能拿出一笔巨款来为一个本来已相当不错的广场换装！让我们看看这是一个什么样的工程：挖去厚厚的水泥表层，运来大量的土和肥料，铺设草皮，修筑围栏，派人养护，以后每年都需要花一笔修护资金。如此看来，乌鲁木齐市不是没有钱，只是舍不得把钱用在教育上。
    作为生活在林立高楼中的城市居民，谁不想身边多一些令人心旷神怡的绿色呢？但是，目前我们还不能超脱到如此境界：自己躺在柔软的草坪上享受着温暖的阳光，同时忍心让孩子或弟妹们在摇摇欲坠的危房中求知若渴。在一个省城里，破败的校舍与锦上添花的广场并存，我不相信这两者的强烈反差会得到精神文明的赞誉。有一点我相信：关于改建人民广场的资金已经单独列出，那么，我以一个关心教育事业也关心市政建设的普通市民的身份呼吁：请把这笔钱用在教育上！
