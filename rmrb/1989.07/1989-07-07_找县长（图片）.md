It was a sunny afternoon in July. The sun was scorching, and the temperature was high. The road was dusty, and the wind was blowing sand. The car was driving on a bumpy road in the countryside. The driver was a young man in his twenties. He was driving a small car, and the car was loaded with various materials. The young man was going to a remote village to find the county magistrate.

The young man's name was Li Ming. He was a college student who had just graduated. He had been assigned to work in a remote village in a poor county. He had heard that the county magistrate was a good official who cared about the people. He wanted to find the county magistrate to discuss some problems in the village.

Li Ming drove for a long time and finally arrived at the village. He got out of the car and walked towards the village. The village was poor, and the houses were dilapidated. The villagers were busy with their work, and no one paid attention to him. Li Ming walked around the village and finally found the county magistrate's office.

The county magistrate's office was a small room. The room was clean and tidy. The county magistrate was sitting at a desk, reading a book. Li Ming knocked on the door and entered the room. The county magistrate looked up and saw Li Ming. He smiled and stood up to greet him.

"Hello, I am Li Ming," Li Ming said. "I am a college graduate who has been assigned to work in this village. I have some problems that I want to discuss with you."

The county magistrate nodded and said, "Please sit down. I am happy to help you."

Li Ming sat down and told the county magistrate about the problems in the village. The county magistrate listened carefully and took notes. He promised to help Li Ming solve the problems.

Li Ming was very happy. He thanked the county magistrate and left the office. He walked back to his car and drove away. He was looking forward to working in the village and helping the people.

The county magistrate watched Li Ming drive away. He was thinking about the problems in the village. He knew that he had a lot of work to do. He was determined to help the people and make the village a better place to live.

The sun was setting, and the sky was turning red. The county magistrate stood up and walked out of the office. He was ready to face the challenges ahead. He was ready to serve the people and make a difference.
