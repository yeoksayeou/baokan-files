	Henan Conducts Comprehensive Inspection of Book and Magazine Market
	Lowbrow and Vulgar Publications Significantly Reduced in 17 Cities Across the Province

	Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 23rd — Reporter Li Erliang reports: In just a few days, those "bare-bodied women" and "masked robbers" that used to flaunt themselves in the book and magazine markets of 17 cities in Henan have significantly decreased. Recently, Henan Province has conducted a thorough cleanup and rectification of the book and magazine markets and publishing order, restoring the cleanliness that many people, especially parents of students, had long desired.

	Henan Province's cleanup and rectification of the book and magazine markets and publishing order began on the 18th, with organized efforts spreading across all 17 cities in the province. The main focus of the inspection and rectification is on: reactionary publications that promote bourgeois liberalization, obscene and pornographic publications or those with lowbrow and vulgar content, publications that promote feudal superstition and violence, as well as other publications that have been notified to stop selling and illegal publications.

	Since the cleanup and rectification began, reporters in the provincial capital of Zhengzhou have seen many book markets undergo a transformation. Starting from the 18th, Zhengzhou City organized over 1,000 personnel from the public security, commerce, and cultural departments, led by a deputy mayor, to inspect 443 stalls, 43 book and magazine wholesale stations, and 190 printing plants within the city. They confiscated and sealed over 340,000 copies of harmful publications and registered all sealed publications for future handling. During the inspection, the inspectors strictly adhered to policy boundaries, seeking guidance from relevant departments for any uncertain cases.

    河南全面清查书刊市场
    低级庸俗刊物在全省17个地市明显减少
    本报郑州7月23日电　记者李而亮报道：短短几天，那些平日招摇于市的“裸身女郎”“蒙面强盗”在河南17个地市的书刊市场上明显减少。河南省近日来对书刊市场、出版秩序进行大力清理整顿，使过去为许多群众尤其是学生家长所忿然的书市恢复了洁净。
    河南省这次对书刊市场、出版秩序的清理整顿工作，从18日开始组织力量在全省17个地市全面展开。清查整顿的主要范围是：宣扬资产阶级自由化的反动书刊，淫秽色情出版物或夹杂淫秽色情内容低级庸俗的书刊，宣扬封建迷信、凶杀暴力的出版物，以及其它已通知停售和非法出版物。
    清理整顿工作开始后，记者在省会郑州市看到，许多书市迅速改变了面貌。从18日开始的3天里，郑州市组织了公安、工商、文化等部门参加的1000多人的队伍，由一名副市长带队，对全市范围内的443个摊点、43个图书刊物批发站、190个印刷厂进行了清查，共收缴、查封各种有害书刊34万余册，并对封存的书刊全部登记造册，待后处理。在清查过程中，检查人员严格注意政策界限，拿不准的，及时请示有关部门再作处理。
