Sedimentation and Pollution in Baiyangdian Lake

Baiyangdian Lake, known as the "Pearl of North China," has faced severe pollution and sedimentation issues since it was refilled last summer. Within just a few months, one-third of its surface area has been contaminated by industrial wastewater. The sedimentation problem in Baiyangdian Lake is becoming increasingly serious. In the 1950s, when the water level was at 7.5 meters, the lake's surface area was 460,000 mu (approximately 306,667 hectares), with a storage capacity of 1.2 billion cubic meters. By the 1980s, at the same water level, the surface area had shrunk to 225,000 mu (approximately 150,333 hectares), and the storage capacity had decreased to 0.8 billion cubic meters. It is understood that the primary cause of Baiyangdian Lake's sedimentation is the excessive flooding from the Baigou Diversion Canal, which introduces an increasing amount of sediment each year.

We urge relevant departments to take measures to treat industrial wastewater and promote afforestation in the Taihang Mountains to control soil erosion. Currently, relevant departments should strictly control the flooding from the Baigou Diversion Canal, restore the original flood route of the Daqing River, and reconstruct the Daqing River inlet project to prevent a large amount of sediment from entering Baiyangdian Lake. This will help preserve the "Pearl of North China" and ensure its enduring brilliance.

    白洋淀泥沙淤积污水蔓延
    素有“华北明珠”之称的白洋淀去年夏天重新蓄水以来，仅仅数月就有1／3水面遭工业污水污染。白洋淀的泥沙淤积日趋严重。50年代，白洋淀在7.5米水位时，水面面积46万亩，蓄水量为1.2亿立方米；80年代，处于同样水位，水面面积已缩小到22.5万亩，蓄水量仅为0.8亿立方米。据了解，白洋淀被泥沙淤积的主要原因是白沟引河超标行洪所致，每年从白沟引河输入的泥沙量不断增多。
    呼吁有关部门采取措施，治理工业废水，同时，搞好太行山的绿化工作，以控制水土流失。目前，有关部门应严格控制白沟引河行洪，恢复大清河原道行洪，改建大清河进口工程，防止大量泥沙冲入白洋淀，使北洋淀这颗“华北明珠”永放光彩。
