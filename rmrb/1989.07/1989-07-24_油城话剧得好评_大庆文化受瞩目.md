The cultural work and flourishing artistic creation in Daqing over the past few years have attracted attention from within and outside the province.

Two large-scale plays, "Cao Zhi" and "Black Stone," received high praise in the capital's theater circles. Some theater theorists exclaimed: Daqing not only produces oil but also produces excellent plays. The theater world has seen the emergence of the "Daqing Oilfield."

As a city developed and built gradually with the exploitation of oil resources, Daqing's culture was a "barren land" in its early years. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the cultural work here began to show signs of rising. Daqing's woodblock prints were exhibited in six countries including the United States and Canada. Photographic works won a bronze medal in the 4th National Photography Competition last year. Daqing's ice and snow artworks won the first prize for best artistic creation and the second place overall in the 4th International Ice Sculpture Competition held in the United States earlier this year. Under the influence of professional culture, mass culture and social culture also presented a thriving new situation.

The rapid rise of Daqing's culture is mainly due to the discovery and cultivation of talent. Over the past few years, Daqing has sent more than 70 professional personnel to national art schools for further studies, among whom more than a dozen have already made a name for themselves in the country.

Yang Limin, a young playwright studying at the Central Academy of Drama, was originally an oil worker. After the leaders of the Daqing Culture Bureau discovered his talent, they immediately transferred him to a professional creation unit and provided strong support in various aspects. In 1983, Yang Limin created the large-scale play "Black Rose," which reflects the life of oil workers and received universal praise during its performance in Beijing.

    油城话剧得好评
    大庆文化受瞩目
    据新华社哈尔滨7月24日电　（记者蒋耀波）大庆近几年的文化工作和繁荣的文艺创作，受到了省内外瞩目。
    两部大型话剧《曹植》和《黑色的石头》，在首都戏剧界受到好评。一些戏剧理论家赞叹：大庆不光出石油，还出好戏。话剧界出了个“大庆油田”。
    作为随着石油资源开发逐步发展建设起来的一座城市，大庆文化在最初十几年里一直是“荒原一片”。党的十一届三中全会以后，这里的文化工作开始展现崛起的势头，大庆的版画曾在美国、加拿大等6个国家展出，摄影作品在去年第4届全国摄影比赛中获铜牌奖，大庆的冰雪艺术作品在今年年初美国举行的第4届国际冰雕比赛中，获得最佳艺术创作第1名和总分第2名。在专业文化的影响下，群众文化、社会文化也呈现出蓬勃发展的新局面。
    大庆文化的迅速崛起，主要得力于人才的发现和培养。几年来，大庆送到全国艺术院校进修的专业人员有70余人，其中十几人目前已在国内崭露头角。
    正在中央戏剧学院就读研究生的青年剧作家杨利民原是个采油工人，大庆文化局的领导发现了他的才气后立刻把他调到了专业创作单位，并在各方面给予大力支持。1983年，杨利民创作出反映石油工人生活的大型话剧《黑色的玫瑰》，进京调演受到普遍好评。
