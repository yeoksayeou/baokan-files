Egyptian Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Boutros Boutros-Ghali summoned U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Frank on July 9 to convey Egypt's official stance opposing Israel's revised election plan for the occupied territories.

Boutros-Ghali stated that the new conditions attached to Shamir's "election plan" are obstacles to the Middle East peace process. They complicate the situation, exacerbate tensions in the occupied territories, escalate violence, and pose a serious threat to the peace process.

Boutros-Ghali conveyed to the U.S. ambassador that Egypt is committed to advancing the Middle East peace process and is dedicated to convening an international peace conference on the Middle East as soon as possible.

On the same day, Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister Boutros Ghali also condemned Shamir's concessions to the extreme right-wing of the Likud Bloc in Israel and his refusal to negotiate with the Palestinians.

It was also revealed that the Egyptian Foreign Ministry had sent an urgent note to Israel, pointing out that the conditions attached by the Likud Bloc to the election plan "block the path to Middle East peace" and would have a negative impact on Egyptian-Israeli relations.

    埃及外长通知美国政府
    反对修改以占区选举计划
    本报开罗7月10日电　记者林皎明报道：埃及副总理兼外交部长马吉德昨天召见美国驻埃及大使弗兰克，将埃及反对以色列修改选举计划的正式立场通知美国政府。
    马吉德外长表示，沙米尔“选举计划”的新设附加条件，是中东和平进程的障碍。它使形势复杂化，导致被占领土紧张加剧、暴力升级，和平进程面临严重危险。
    马吉德外长向美国大使表示，埃及坚持推进中东和平进程，致力于尽快召开中东和平国际会议。
    同日，埃及外交国务部长加利也谴责沙米尔向以色列利库德集团极右翼退让，拒绝与巴勒斯坦人谈判。
    另据透露，埃及外交部已向以色列发出紧急照会，指出利库德集团对选举计划附加的条件“堵塞中东和平道路”，将对埃以关系带来消极影响。
