Visiting Life

Wú Wēi

I have never known what life is, nor have I known what life contains. So, in that spring rain season, I took out my pink parasol, braved the drizzling rain, and went to visit spring. I asked the trees, the flowers, the grass if they were happy, if they were joyful. I wondered if they longed for someone, if the blooming and falling of flowers each season was for whom. But they would not answer you. All the answers are within your own heart. You would surely think that the plum blossom is extremely happy, because it has a pink, smiling face. You say that the little grass must be lonely, because it is so inconspicuous, and no one's gaze will linger on it.

Under that pink parasol of spring, you visit one life after another, but all the answers are ones you have composed yourself. You must know, life is life. They grow silently, without so many puzzles and doubts. As time passes, the grass withers and blooms anew each year, people are born generation after generation. They silently repeat, all the answers are written in time, and yet washed away by time. You will never find them.

Life is life. People cannot refuse life, nor can they refuse everything in life.

You shake your head, not believing. But in that spring rain season, you light a small red lantern to visit life. You discover that each life has its own content. Peach blossoms have red petals, plum blossoms have gnarled branches. Some people may wear blue clothes all their lives, walking alone under the gray-blue sky; others will wear red robes, jumping and skipping on the green lawn. You will not know what content that life has, what worries, what joys. But you know that although each life is not easy, each life is graceful and beautiful.

When the red lantern goes out, you roll on the lawn, surrounded by lives of different content—you, the intelligent being.

So you rush back into the house, turn on all the lights, and tell me: Living is an art, life is an art, but the same life will not have the same art.

Visiting life, spring, life in spring.

    拜访生命
    吴逶
    从来不知道什么是生命，从来也不知生命包含了什么内容，于是在那个春天的雨季，打起那把粉红色的小伞，冒着蒙蒙细雨，去拜访春天，去问问，那些树，那些花，那些草，它们可幸福？可快乐？它们可会相思，一季季的花开花落为的又是谁。可是它们不会回答你，所有的答案都在你自己心里。你一定觉得那朵梅花幸福极了，因为它有一张粉红色而带笑的脸庞。你说那棵小草一定寂寞，因为它那么不起眼，谁的目光也不会在它那儿停留。
    在那把春天的粉红色小伞下，你拜访着一个又一个生命，可所有的答案都是你自己编排。要知道，生命就是生命，它们默然生长，没有那么多的不解与疑惑。岁月流逝中，草一岁一枯荣，人一代又一代再生，它们默然重复，所有的答案都写在时间上，而又被时间冲走，你永远也找不到。
    生命就是生命，人无法拒绝生命，也无法拒绝生命中的一切。
    你摇摇头，不相信。可是在那个春天的雨季，你点起小小的红灯笼去拜访生命，你发现，每个生命有每个生命的内容，桃花有红的花瓣，梅花有苍虬的枝干，有的人也许一辈子穿着蓝衣服，在灰蓝色的天空下踽踽独行；有的人就会穿一身红衫，在绿草坪上蹦蹦跳跳。你不会知道，那个生命有什么样的内容，有什么样的忧思，有什么样的欢乐，但你知道，尽管每个生命都不轻松，但每个生命都怡然而优美。
    红灯笼熄灭时你在草坪上打着滚，四周是内容不同的生命，簇拥着你——万物之灵。
    于是你冲回屋里，开亮所有的灯，告诉我：活着是艺术，生命是艺术，但相同的生命不会有相同艺术。
    拜访生命、春天，春天里的生命。
