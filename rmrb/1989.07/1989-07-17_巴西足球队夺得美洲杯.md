The Brazilian football team won the Copa America.

Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, July 16 - (Reporter Tong Bingqiang) The 1989 Copa America football tournament concluded this afternoon at the Maracana Stadium here. The Brazilian team defeated the defending champion Uruguay 1-0 in the final match, securing the Copa America title. Uruguay finished second, and Argentina took third place.

The match between Brazil and Uruguay to decide the championship began at 5 PM. Since both teams had won two matches each, scored five goals, conceded one goal, and had equal points, the winner of this match would be the champion of this tournament. Playing on home turf, Brazil had the advantages of favorable weather, location, and public support. Although their performance in the group stage was average, they improved with each match in the finals. Experts predicted before the game that Brazil had a higher chance of winning. Uruguay, the champions of the previous two tournaments, aimed to defend their title.

After the start of the match, both teams played cautiously, avoiding rash attacks. In the first half, both teams had few scoring opportunities and failed to score. In the second half, Brazil changed their strategy, launching more attacks from the wings. Just four minutes into the second half, Brazil capitalized on a quick counterattack, bringing the ball to the right side of the penalty area. Forward Romário quickly inserted himself into the Uruguayan goal area to receive a cross from the right side, leaping to head the ball into the net, scoring the decisive goal for Brazil. Afterward, Uruguay launched repeated attacks on the Brazilian goal in an attempt to equalize, but their efforts were thwarted by Brazil's tight defense.

Today, two matches were held at the Maracana Stadium. Before the championship match, the World Cup champion Argentina played Paraguay for third place. Both teams had lost to Brazil and Uruguay in the final round, but Argentina had conceded two fewer goals than Paraguay, so a draw would secure them third place. Paraguay, aiming for a better position, had to defeat Argentina. The match was evenly contested, with Paraguay playing more aggressively, but they failed to break through Argentina's defense. The match ended in a 0-0 draw. The famous player Maradona, who had played in every match so far, did not appear in today's game.

    巴西足球队夺得美洲杯
    新华社里约热内卢7月16日电　（记者童炳强）1989年美洲杯足球赛今天下午在这里的马拉卡纳足球场降下帷幕。巴西队在最后一场比赛中以1∶0击败上届冠军乌拉圭队，夺走美洲杯；乌拉圭队居第二名，阿根廷队名列第三。
    巴西队与乌拉圭队争夺冠军的比赛是下午5时开始的。由于双方决赛以来都已胜两场，各进5个球、未失1球，积分也相等，所以，此役谁胜谁将成为本届比赛的盟主。巴西队在本土作战，占有天时、地利、人和优势，尽管它在小组赛中成绩平平，但进入决赛以来一场比一场踢得好。行家赛前认为，今天的这场球巴西队获胜可能性较大。乌拉圭队是上两届杯主，决心蝉联冠军。
    开赛后，双方踢得都比较谨慎，不轻易发动进攻。上半场双方进攻次数不多，都没有进球。下半场，巴西队改变了打法，多从两侧发动进攻。比赛刚进行4分钟，巴西队利用一次快速进攻，将球带入底线右侧。此时，前锋罗马里奥迅速插到乌拉圭队门前接应从右侧的传中球，跃起用头一顶，球破门而入，为巴西队攻进决定性的一个球。此后，乌拉圭队为挽回败局，频频向巴西队大门发起进攻，但均被巴西队严密的防守瓦解。
    今天在马拉卡纳足球场举行了本届杯赛的最后两场球赛。在冠军争夺战之前，进行了由世界杯赛冠军阿根廷队与巴拉圭队争夺第三名的比赛。进入决赛阶段以来，两队均输给了巴西队和乌拉圭队，阿根廷队由于净输球比巴拉圭队少两个，所以这场比赛只要踢平就能取得第三名，而巴拉圭队为争取较好名次，必须战胜阿根廷队。这场比赛双方实力不相上下，巴拉圭队踢得比较积极，但在阿根廷队的严密防守下，未能攻破对方大门，结果双方以0∶0握手言和。参赛以来一直上场比赛的著名球星马拉多纳今天未上场献技。
