It is said that Americans are the most adventurous people in the world. According to a psychological test, more than 70% of young people like to take risks, seek excitement, and want to personally experience the taste of being on the brink of death. Therefore, auto racing is very popular in the United States. First, it can bring huge prizes and fame; second, it allows one to experience the thrill of being on the edge of death, which is very exciting.

Recently, in Washington, another dangerous sport has become popular—riding horses off cliffs, just hearing about it makes one's heart race. It is said that this sport was invented by the Indians. Every year, they gather in a tribe, choose a cliff that looks like it was cut by an axe, and let the horse-riding heroes ride down the cliff together. Whoever crosses the finish line first becomes the number one hero of the Indians. This sport is extremely dangerous. Riders must jump from a 90-degree vertical cliff with no railings or safety facilities on either side. It is common for horses to be startled and stumble, and the riders on the horses will be trampled to death.

Although this sport is dangerous, the number of "horse lovers" in Washington has increased to 30,000. They regularly hold competitions with the same scale and conditions as the Indians used to have, except that after riding down the mountain, they must also cross a river to reach the finish line. The champion can win 1,300 pounds, and the prize is not high. However, since the champion can have a state beauty queen accompany them to dinner, many people are eager to participate.

Additionally, the United States also has the "bridge jumping death" sport. Competitors stand on a bridge about 360 feet high, tie a bungee cord around their bodies, and then jump into the air towards the water surface, falling at a speed of 200 kilometers per hour into the valley. When the bungee cord's elasticity is exhausted, the competitor is pulled up like a ping-pong ball and bounces in the air until they fall down, which is very exciting.

### 死亡线上的运动

    死亡线上的运动
    据说美国人是世界上最爱冒险的民族。根据一项心理测验，百分之七十以上的青年人喜欢冒险，寻找刺激，想亲自体验一下接近死亡边缘的味道。所以，在美国赛车运动大行其道，一是可得巨奖，名成利就；二是可以体验死亡边缘之味道，十分刺激。
    最近，在华盛顿又掀起另一种死亡运动——骑马冲下悬崖，听着就让人心里发毛。据传说，这种运动是印第安人发明的，他们每年都集中到一个部落，选一条斧劈刀削似的悬崖，让那些骑马英雄齐齐的冲下悬崖，哪个最快冲线，就成为印第安第一大英雄。这项运动非常危险，骑马者要从九十度直角，两边既没有栏杆又没有任何安全设施的悬崖上一起冲下来，马受惊吓失前蹄的惨景时有发生，而马上英雄则会被马踏死。
    该项运动虽危险，但华盛顿的“马迷”已增至三万人，他们定时举行比赛，规模、条件同以前印第安人一模一样，只不过冲下山后，还要越过一条河流，才到终点。冠军可得一千三百英镑，奖并不高，但是，由于冠军可有一位州选美人陪进晚餐，所以参加的人十分踊跃。
    另外，美国还流行“跳桥死亡”运动，比赛者站在离地约三百六十英尺高的桥上，身扎一条有弹性的绳子，然后凌空一跳，向水面跃下，以时速二百公里的速度直坠深谷。当绳索弹力拉尽时，比赛者有如弹子一样被弹力扯起，在空中弹起直至落下，十分刺激。
