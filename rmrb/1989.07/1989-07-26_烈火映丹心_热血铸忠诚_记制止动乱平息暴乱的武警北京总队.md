The summer of 1989 saw the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, a page in the history of the Republic written in blood and fire, which records the merits of the People's Liberation Army and also the merits of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police.

The National Flag Always Rises with the Sun

From April 15, 1989, when Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away, it took only about 20 days for the 400,000 square meters of Tiananmen Square to be "eaten up" by the crowds of demonstrators and hunger strikers, leaving only the 176 square meters of the flag enclosure as a clean area.

The sentry post of the National Flag Guard of the Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police was surrounded. Some people tried to stuff the sentries with leaflets inciting the disturbance, some tried to persuade the sentries to write letters of support, and there were also the incessant loudspeakers of the "High Autonomous Federation" and "Workers' Autonomous Federation" blaring in the sentries' ears 24 hours a day. The flag guards paid no attention to these provocations and faithfully carried out their sacred duty of protecting the national flag.

A handful of conspirators who plotted the disturbance changed from incitement to provocation. Several people tried to cross the white marble flag enclosure to hang a defamatory portrait of a party and state leader on the flagpole. The sentries stopped them boldly, preventing them from succeeding.

On April 20, another group of people brought a large wreath to place next to the national flag's white marble railing, claiming to mourn the victims of the so-called "April 20 massacre." The sentries exposed the lie and ordered them to take the wreath away. Some people threw bottles of soda and ice cream at the sentries, and sprayed fruit juice from soft packaging onto the sentries' faces. To avoid causing trouble for the party and government in dealing with the disturbance, the sentries swallowed their tears and strictly adhered to the discipline of "not retaliating with words or blows," standing like statues under the national flag of the Republic.

Provocation turned into disruption and destruction. On May 20, the first day of the martial law announcement in some areas of Beijing, in the morning, when the flag guards were about to hoist the flag, someone shouted, "Don't raise the flag! Today is the day of national humiliation!" The platoon leader Zhang Genheng and squad leader Qi Jianhua engaged in a reasoned struggle with the representatives of the "High Autonomous Federation." "The national flag is the symbol of the People's Republic of China. If the national flag is not raised for a day, it will have an impact internationally, and that will be the real national humiliation!" The person who tried to disrupt the flag-raising was speechless and had nothing to say.

The five-star red flag rose with the morning sun.

Opening the Way Through the Fire

On the night of June 3, it was a night of life-and-death struggle between revolution and counter-revolution. The Beijing Garrison of the People's Armed Police was tasked with organizing a batch of riot control personnel to clear the way for the PLA to enter the city to enforce martial law and to gather forces at the Xidan intersection to clear the roads.

At 22:40, the first echelon of the riot control team of the People's Armed Police marched on foot at the forefront of the martial law troops' vehicles, departing from the Military Museum and advancing along Chang'an Street towards Tiananmen Square. They had not gone far when they saw that several public buses and cars were blocking the Muxidi Bridge, burning fiercely, and a crowd of people who did not understand the truth gathered at the bridgehead.

"Block them!"

"Smash them to death!"

Stones, bricks, and Molotov cocktails rained down on the riot control team, blocking their way. Not a moment could be wasted. On the order of Deputy Director Wang Zhiqiang of the Internal Security Department, dozens of tear gas grenades flew out from the hands of the riot control personnel, causing a commotion in the crowd, which scattered to both sides of the road. The riot control personnel took advantage of the situation and charged forward in three columns.

At the bridgehead of Fuxingmen, another fierce battle awaited them. Several public buses and cars were burning fiercely on the bridge, and the fuel tanks were exploding with a "bang bang" sound.

The leading officers of the brigade were the first to charge into the fire, and other brave riot control personnel followed, climbing over the burning car roofs, crawling under the cars, and squeezing through the gaps between the car bodies. They opened up a passage for the military vehicles through the fire.

While the riot control team was attacking, the People's Armed Police officers stationed at the Xidan intersection to clear the roads were using their wits. At 23:15, Brigade Commander Yang De'an led hundreds of officers to overcome various difficulties and arrived at the Xidan intersection. Before they could stand firmly, they were surrounded by a crowd of people who did not understand the truth and were incited by the rioters.

Brigade Commander Yang quickly came up with a plan. He loudly ordered the People's Armed Police soldiers to run to the front of the Minzu Gong. His shout attracted the crowd of people who did not understand the truth to chase after the officers of the brigade. Stones, rubble, and Molotov cocktails were all thrown at the People's Armed Police. Brigade Commander Yang ordered again, and dozens of tear gas grenades bloomed in the crowd of pursuers. The crowd hurriedly retreated to the Xidan intersection. The People's Armed Police officers took the opportunity to chase back, and then quickly returned to the front of the Minzu Gong.

Chase over—push back—chase over again—push back again... From Xidan to Minzu Gong, a total of 8 rounds of "tug-of-war" were fought. The officers of the brigade kept the crowd of people who did not understand the truth at the front of the Minzu Gong. The long convoy of military vehicles, guided by the riot control team, rushed past Minzu Gong, rushed past Xidan, and headed straight for Tiananmen Square.

At around 1:30 AM on June 4, the martial law troops arrived at Tiananmen Square on time. The commanders of the martial law command hugged the riot control personnel one by one, praising them as having iron legs, iron heads, iron arms, and iron voices, and having made great contributions to clearing the way into the city. The People's Armed Police and the citizens together build a "Great Wall"

After midnight on June 4, 164 officers of the First Brigade of the People's Armed Police who were besieged near Minzu Gong organized a breakout.

The officers were cornered in Xixingsheng Hutong. This was a dead end. The rioters drove a jeep to the entrance of the hutong, turned on the headlights, and shone them into the hutong. Stones and bricks flew, and sticks and iron bars danced.

In an instant, the doors of the four residential courtyards in the hutong were all opened, and the 164 soldiers in danger were all called into the courtyards.

The rioters regarded Courtyard 32 as the main target of attack. The entire courtyard had 5 households and 18 people. Except for 3 children under the age of 7, everyone went into battle. They held hands and stood shoulder to shoulder, forming a human wall to protect the 51 wounded soldiers inside the courtyard.

The rioters had no choice but to retreat temporarily, leaving behind a final warning: "If the People's Armed Police are not handed over by dawn, the entire courtyard will be flattened!"

Fearless of the threats, the residents were eager to save lives. All 39 households in the hutong, for the safety of the wounded, provided royal jelly, cooked sugar water, found bandages, and set up new spring mattresses...

There were more than a dozen soldiers with serious leg injuries who could not move. They really couldn't hold it in any longer, but there was no public toilet in the courtyard, and the young woman Lü Fenling took out sheets of cowhide paper and placed them in front of the soldiers, saying, "You don't have to worry about anything, saving your life is the most important thing. It's too dangerous to go to the public toilet outside the courtyard..." She continuously wrapped the excrement of more than 10 wounded soldiers in cowhide paper and threw it into the garbage bin outside the courtyard.

"We can't add any more danger to the residents, we have to get out of the hutong quickly." The People's Armed Police made a decisive decision. The residents then took out their own clothes to change for the soldiers. At 5:30 AM on June 4, after disguising themselves, the 164 officers safely moved to the designated location.

Protecting the "Lifeline" of the Capital

Incite a prison riot! Blow up oil depots, power plants, and dams, and turn Beijing into a blind and lame city!

This is not an exaggeration, but the battle on another front that the People's Armed Police soldiers faced!

Since the disturbances and riots in Beijing, many prisoners in a certain detention center have been jumping and shouting. "We also want to dialogue, we also want to go on a hunger strike!" "Kill the guards of the People's Armed Police, break out to take revenge!" "If a ferocious tiger escapes from the prison, the people will suffer, and we will be derelict in our duty." The officers and soldiers of the People's Armed Police who were on duty to guard the prisoners were on high alert, closely monitoring every move inside the prison cells, and would not let any plot of the criminals succeed.

The oil and liquefied gas produced by the Yanshan Petrochemical Company are like the blood of the capital. A few conspirators and rioters had their eyes on it, and they incited many people who did not understand the truth to gather at the factory gate, shouting for the workers to go on strike. If anything happened to the dense network of oil and gas pipelines, the ten-mile oil city would become a sea of fire. The soldiers guarded the factory vigilantly.

On June 5, the counter-revolutionary rioters tried to make a desperate attempt, shouting and making a fuss outside the factory gate, and took up the posture of seizing weapons. Platoon Leader Zhou Jingming fearlessly warned those rioters: "If anyone ignores the law, does not listen to advice, and seizes weapons, all consequences will be borne by the perpetrators!" The crowd was intimidated by the People's Armed Police.

From early April to early June, Beijing had no water cuts, no power outages, no gas interruptions... All important targets and key positions related to the lives of the people of the capital, which were guarded by the People's Armed Police, were firmly in the hands of the people.

    烈火映丹心  热血铸忠诚
    ——记制止动乱平息暴乱的武警北京总队
    陈生庚　李训舟　周德伟
    1989年初夏，首都发生的反革命暴乱被一举平息，共和国的历史上用血与火写就的这可歌可泣的一页，铭刻着人民解放军的功绩，也铭刻着中国人民武装警察部队北京总队干警的功绩。
        国旗始终与太阳一起升起
    从1989年4月15日胡耀邦同志逝世开始，仅仅20多天，40万平方米的天安门广场，便被游行示威、绝食请愿的人群“蚕食”得只剩下国旗围栏内的176平方米的这块净土了。
    广场上武警天安门中队国旗班的哨位处于重重包围之中。有人将煽动动乱的传单成团成捆的硬往哨兵手里塞，有人劝逼哨兵书写声援书，更有那喋喋不休的“高自联”、“工自联”的高音喇叭，一天24小时在哨兵的耳际鼓噪……国旗班的战士们对此不屑一顾，忠实地履行着护卫国旗的神圣职责。
    一小撮阴谋策划动乱的家伙，对国旗班的哨兵从煽动变成挑衅。几个家伙企图越过汉白玉的国旗围栏，要把污辱党和国家某领导人的画像挂在旗杆上。哨兵们理直气壮地上前阻止，使其没有得逞。
    4月20日，又有一伙人抬着一个大花圈，要放在国旗的汉白玉栏杆旁，说是悼念在所谓“四·二○”惨案中的遇难者。哨兵们戳穿谎言，当即令其将花圈抬走。还有人将汽水瓶、冰棍，“噼噼啪啪”地打在哨兵身上，将软包装袋里的果汁水“吱吱溜溜”地射在哨兵脸上。为不给党和政府处置动乱添麻烦，哨兵们把泪水咽进肚子，严守“骂不还口，打不还手”的纪律，依然似一尊尊雕像，傲然屹立在共和国的国旗下。
    挑衅又发展为捣乱破坏。5月20日，是国务院宣布在北京部分地区实施戒严的第一天。清晨，当国旗班的战士们挚着国旗来到国旗旗座旁时，一个家伙说：“不许升旗！今天宣布戒严是国耻日！”
    中队指导员张根恒和排长齐建华，同“高自联”的代表面对面地展开了说理斗争。“国旗是中华人民共和国的象征，一天不升国旗，就会在国际上造成影响，那才是真正的国耻！”想捣乱的那个人张口结舌，无言以对。
    五星红旗迎着朝霞，同太阳一起冉冉升起了。
          火海中打开军车行进道
    6月3日夜晚，这是革命与反革命进行殊死搏斗的一夜。武警北京总队接受的任务是组织一批防暴队员，为进城执行戒严任务的解放军开道；集结兵力在西单路口疏通道路。
    22时40分，武警防暴队第一梯队的官兵徒步走在戒严部队军车的最前头，从军事博物馆出发沿长安街向天安门广场开进。没走多远，他们就见木樨地桥上横着数辆公共电、汽车，燃起熊熊大火，桥头聚集着黑压压的不明真相的人群。
      “堵住他们！”
      “砸死他们！”
    石头、瓦块、燃烧瓶雨点般地向着防暴队袭来，开道受阻。时间一刻也不能耽误，总队内卫处副处长王志强一声令下，十几枚催泪弹从防暴队员手中飞了出去，人群中一阵骚动，纷纷向马路两旁退去。防暴队员乘虚而入，成三路纵队向前冲去。
    复兴门桥头，迎接他们的又是一场恶战。堵在桥上的十几辆公共电、汽车熊熊燃烧着，油箱“嘭叭、嘭叭”地爆炸。
    走在防暴队先头的支队领导率先闯进了火海，其他防暴勇士纷纷从熊熊燃烧着的车顶上翻了过去，从车底下爬了过去，从车箱的连结处钻了过去……他们从火海中又打开了军车行进的通道。
    防暴队在强攻，位于西单路口执行疏通道口任务的武警官兵却在智取。23时15分，一支队支队长杨德安带领数百名官兵克服种种困难，到达西单路口，脚跟没有立稳，便被暴徒煽动下的不明真相的人群团团围住。
    杨支队长急中生智，大声命令武警战士跑步到民族宫门前。他的喊声吸引了不明真相的人群向一支队官兵猛追过去，石块、瓦砾、燃烧瓶，一齐向着武警砸去。杨支队长又一声令下，数十枚催泪弹在尾追的人群中开花。人群慌忙退向西单路口。武警官兵趁机回头紧追过去，然后又一个闪身再回到民族宫门前。
    追过来——顶回去——再追过来——再顶回去……从西单到民族宫，整整展开了8次“拉锯战”，一支队官兵把西单路口的不明真相的人群牵制在民族宫门前。长长的军车队伍在防暴队的引导下，冲过民族宫，冲过西单，直奔天安门广场。
    凌晨1时30分左右，戒严部队准时到达天安门广场。戒严指挥部的首长一个一个地拥抱着防暴队员，赞扬他们是铁腿、铁头、铁臂、铁嗓子，为进城开路立下了汗马功劳。武警与市民共筑“长城”
    6月4日零点过后，武警一支队被围困在民族宫附近的164名官兵组织突围。
    官兵们被逼进了西兴盛胡同。这是一条死胡同。暴徒们将一辆吉普车开到胡同口，打开车灯，直射胡同内，石块、砖瓦横飞，木棒、铁棍乱舞。
    刹时，胡同内4个居民院的院门全部打开，164名危在旦夕的战士统统被唤进了院内。
    暴徒们视32号院为主要攻击目标。全院共5户人家，18口人，除了3个7岁以下的孩子外，全部上阵。他们手挽手，肩并肩，组成了一道人墙，掩护着留在院内的51名伤员。
    暴徒们无可奈何地暂时撤走，他们甩下的最后一句警告是：“天亮后不交出武警，扫平全部院子！”
    淫威不怕，救人心切。全胡同39户人家为了伤员的生命安全，有的拿出了蜂王浆，有的熬起了糖稀饭，有的找来了包扎药，有的架起了崭新的席梦思床……
    有十几名战士腿部严重受伤，不能动弹，他们实在憋不住大便了，院子里又没有公共厕所，年轻妇女乐凤玲拿出一张张牛皮纸放在战士跟前说：“你们什么也不要顾忌了，保命要紧，到院子外上公共厕所太危险……”她一连将10多名伤员的大便用牛皮纸包上送到了院外的垃圾桶。
    “不能再给居民增添危险，得赶快撤出胡同。”武警官兵果断地做出决定。居民们又把自己的衣服献出来给战士们换上。4日早晨5点30分，经过化装后的164名官兵安全转移到了指定地点。
          严守首都“生命线”
    策动暴狱！炸掉油库、电厂、水坝，让北京城变成瞎子、瘸子！
    这不是危言耸听，这是武警战士面临的另一条战线的战斗！
    某监所自从北京发生动乱和暴乱以后，许多犯人手舞足蹈，又叫又跳。“我们也要对话，我们也要绝食！”“打死看守武警，冲出去报仇！”
      “如果有一只恶虎逃出牢房，人民就要遭殃，我们就是渎职。”执行看押任务的武警中队干部战士克尽职守，严阵以待，协助公安人员密切注视着监房内的一切动向，决不让罪犯的任何阴谋得逞。
    燕山石化公司所生产的石油、液化气如同首都的血液。极少数阴谋家和暴徒对它虎视眈眈，他们裹挟着许多不明真相的群众，聚集到工厂门口，叫嚷着要工人罢工。密密麻麻的油气管道一旦有个三长两短，十里油城将会变成一片火海。战士们警惕地守卫着工厂。
    6月5日，反革命暴徒企图孤注一掷，在厂门外狂呼乱叫，摆开了抢枪的架式。中队指导员周景明毫无惧色，他正告那些暴徒：“如果有人无视法律，不听劝告，抢夺武器，一切后果由肇事者自负！”人群被武警威慑住了。
    从4月上旬到6月上旬，北京没有停水，没有停电，没有停气……由武警驻守的一切与首都人民生活息息相关的重要目标和要害部位，都牢牢掌握在人民手中。
