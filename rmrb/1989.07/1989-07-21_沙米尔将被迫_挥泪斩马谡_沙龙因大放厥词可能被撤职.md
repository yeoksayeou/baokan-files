Shamir May Have to "Execute" Sharon
Sharon May Be Dismissed for His Outburst

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, July 20

According to a report by Israeli radio this morning, Israeli Prime Minister Shamir is considering dismissing Industry and Trade Minister Sharon. This hardliner from the Likud bloc publicly called for the "elimination of PLO Chairman Arafat" on July 17.

According to sources close to Shamir, the prime minister has no choice but to dismiss Sharon from his ministerial post in the Likud-Labor coalition government to quell the current cabinet crisis.

Sharon's public call for the assassination of Arafat has been criticized by Labor Party leaders, and Arab countries as well as the United States have all expressed condemnation.

The Israeli coalition government has been facing a serious crisis since the Likud bloc proposed more stringent conditions for elections in the occupied territories on July 5. The Labor Party's decision-making body proposed withdrawing from the coalition government on July 11. Sharon's remarks have further exacerbated this crisis.

    沙米尔将被迫“挥泪斩马谡”
    沙龙因大放厥词可能被撤职
    新华社安曼7月20日电  据以色列电台今晨报道，以色列总理沙米尔正考虑撤销工业和贸易部长沙龙的职务。这位利库德集团的强硬派在本月17日曾公然呼吁“消灭巴解组织主席阿拉法特”。
    据接近沙米尔的人士说，这位总理别无选择，只有罢免沙龙在利库德集团和工党联合政府中的部长职位，以便平息目前的内阁危机。
    沙龙公开提出暗杀阿拉法特的讲话遭到了工党领导人的抨击，阿拉伯国家甚至美国也纷纷提出谴责。
    以色列联合政府自沙米尔的利库德集团7月5日提出在被占领土举行选举更为苛刻的条件以来就面临着严重的危机，工党决策机构11日提出退出联合政府的建议。这次沙龙讲话更加重了这一危机。
