The Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday deported Huang Debei, a reporter from the Taiwan-based *Zilibao* (Independence Daily). During his stay in Beijing, Huang Debei, under the guise of a tourist, not only conducted illegal interviews and published reports that distorted facts and incited unrest and counter-revolutionary riots, but also drew maps of the deployment of martial law troops. He secretly communicated and plotted with wanted criminals and leaders of illegal organizations to escape, violating mainland China's criminal law. Huang Debei has admitted to these actions. Nevertheless, relevant authorities, considering the overall situation of cross-strait relations, decided not to pursue criminal charges against him and instead handled the case leniently.

More than a year ago, two reporters from Taiwan's *Ziliwanbao* (Independence Evening News) broke through the Taiwan authorities' "three noes" policy and became the first to visit the mainland for interviews, receiving a warm welcome. Subsequently, many Taiwanese media outlets sent reporters to the mainland for interviews, all of whom received assistance from relevant mainland authorities and the media, demonstrating the mainland's sincerity in promoting cross-strait exchanges and cooperation and facilitating the realization of "three links" (direct links in mail, transport, and trade).

Journalists coming to the mainland for interviews must abide by the mainland's laws and regulations and not engage in activities inconsistent with their journalist status. Only on this basis can we discuss press freedom. This principle is upheld in any civilized country. As long as this principle is followed, we will continue to sincerely welcome news organizations from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and overseas to apply for and send reporters to the mainland for interviews. We will continue to warmly welcome and cooperate with them sincerely.

Over the past two years, the atmosphere across the Taiwan Strait has gradually become more harmonious, which is warmly welcomed by people on both sides. We should cherish this. Recently, General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the CPC Central Committee reiterated that China's policies towards Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, based on the principle of "one country, two systems," will not change. The policy of "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" represents the common aspirations and fundamental interests of the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, and we will continue to steadfastly implement it. The various policies towards Taiwan since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC will also not change and will continue to be implemented. However, we have noted that the Taiwan authorities still insist on an anti-communist and anti-reunification stance, adhering to the "three noes" policy, and delaying the peaceful reunification of the motherland. In particular, in recent periods, the Taiwan authorities have misjudged the situation, intensified their "political counterattack" against the mainland, conducted political infiltration, and even directly instigated and funded activities against the government of the People's Republic of China. Such actions are neither popular nor will they succeed.

Over the past two years, the development of cross-strait exchanges in visits, tourism, mail, trade, investment, and other activities is an irreversible trend. Recently, due to disturbances in some parts of the mainland and the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, as well as the distorted propaganda by certain domestic and foreign media, these activities have been affected to some extent. Now, the disturbances have been suppressed, and the riots have been quelled. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CPC has been successfully held. The mainland's social order is stable, and various construction and reform efforts continue to proceed smoothly. We hope that cross-strait relations can continue to develop. Promoting the great cause of peaceful reunification is in the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including Taiwan compatriots, and is our sacred historical responsibility. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will prioritize national interests, assess the situation, and act wisely.

### 共同珍惜海峡两岸祥和气氛

    共同珍惜海峡两岸祥和气氛
    北京市国家安全局昨日将台湾自立报系记者黄德北押解出境。
    黄德北在北京期间，利用旅游者的身份，不仅非法进行采访，发表歪曲事实、挑唆煽动动乱和反革命暴乱的报道，而且还绘制戒严部队兵力部署图，公然与政府通缉犯、非法组织头目秘密联系策划外逃，触犯了中国大陆的刑律，对此，黄德北本人已供认不讳。即便如此，我有关方面还是从海峡两岸关系的大局出发，免于追究他刑事责任，给予从宽处理。
    一年多前，台湾《自立晚报》两名记者冲破台湾当局的“三不”政策，首次来到大陆进行采访，受到了欢迎。以后，台湾很多报刊也先后派出记者前来大陆采访，都得到我有关方面和新闻界的协助，足见大陆对推动两岸交流合作、促进实现“三通”的诚意。
    前来采访的记者必须遵守大陆的法律法令，不得从事与记者身份不符的活动，在这个基础上，才有可能谈得上新闻采访自由。这个原则在任何一个文明国家都是要坚持的。只要遵守这个原则，我们仍然诚心欢迎台湾、港澳及海外新闻机构经过申请批准，继续派记者前来中国大陆采访，我们将一如既往地热情欢迎和给予真诚合作。
    海峡两岸两年多来渐显祥和气氛，这是两岸人民所衷心欢迎的，我们应予珍惜。最近，中共中央总书记江泽民重申，中国按照“一国两制”的原则制定的对香港、澳门和台湾的方针、政策不会改变。“和平统一、一国两制”的方针，是代表两岸中国人的共同心愿和根本利益的，我们将要继续坚定不移地贯彻执行。中共十一届三中全会以来的各项对台政策也都不会改变，同样要继续贯彻执行。但是我们也注意到台湾当局目前仍然坚持反共拒和的立场，僵守“三不”政策，拖延祖国和平统一进程。特别是最近一个时期，台湾当局错误估计形势，加紧对大陆“政治反攻”，进行政治渗透，甚至直接策动、资助从事反对中华人民共和国政府的活动。这种做法既不得人心，也是不能得逞的。
    两年多来，海峡两岸发展起来的探亲、旅游、通邮、通商、贸易、投资活动是大势所趋，不可遏止。前不久，因大陆一些地方发生动乱和北京发生反革命暴乱，加上海内外某些舆论机构歪曲事实的宣传，使这些活动受到了一定程度的影响。现在，动乱已被制止，暴乱已经平息。中共十三届四中全会已胜利召开。大陆社会秩序稳定，各项建设和改革事业继续顺利进行。我们希望海峡两岸关系能继续向前发展，因为促进和平统一大业这是包括台湾同胞在内的全中国人民的根本利益所在，也是我们的神圣的历史责任。我们希望台湾当局以民族利益为重，审时度势，好自为之。
