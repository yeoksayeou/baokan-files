Xinhua News Agency, Rio de Janeiro, July 17th.

Brazil's President Sarney today stated that Brazil will not halt debt repayment, but debt repayment must ensure that the current level of foreign exchange reserves does not decline.

Sarney made these remarks to the *Jornal do Brasil* upon his return to Brazil from attending the bicentennial celebration of the French bourgeois revolution in Paris. He said, "Brazil has no intention of halting debt repayment, but it must protect its foreign exchange reserves. Once there is a dollar income, Brazil will fulfill its debt repayment obligations."

During his stay in France, Sarney discussed the debt repayment issue with Brazil's main creditors. However, he believes that there will be no new progress in negotiating the debt issue because "creditor banks do not have the tradition of negotiating with a government that is about to complete its term."

    巴西总统表示
    不中止偿还外债
    新华社里约热内卢7月17日电　巴西总统萨尔内今天表示，巴西不会中止还债，但还债必须以保证现有外汇储备水平不下降为前提。
    萨尔内是在参加在巴黎举办的法国资产阶级大革命二百周年纪念活动返回巴西时对《环球报》发表这番讲话的。他说，巴西“没有任何要中止还债的意图，但必须保护自己的外汇储备。一旦有了美元收入，巴西就履行其还债义务”。
    萨尔内在法国期间曾同巴西的主要债主讨论了还债问题。但他认为，巴西在谈判债务问题上不会有新的进展，因为“债权银行没有同一个国家即将任满的政府进行谈判的传统”。
