On the Sichuan-Tibet Highway from Chengdu to Lhasa, I have traveled back and forth countless times. This year, for the first time, I encountered some foreign tourists from afar. These visitors from the homeland of Shakespeare and Marie Curie, the brothers and sisters of Maradona and Hayman, the compatriots of Louis Ahrens and Seiji Ozawa, some of them set off from Chengdu along the highway straight to Lhasa, while others travel in the opposite direction. Each of them is full of enthusiasm, their eyes sparkling with curiosity and wonder.

These foreign tourists travel in various ways. Some take the car tour, riding in comfortable tourist buses or long-distance public buses. A few sit in what might be "hitchhiking" cars (when they can no longer walk, they ask the driver for a ride). Most of these are elderly or occasionally unwell travelers. Next are those who ride bicycles, buying a bike in Chengdu or Lhasa and disposing of it upon arrival at their destination. There are even more who trek on foot, measuring the vast landscape with their iron legs. The latter two groups are all strong and healthy young adults.

They travel in groups of three or five, men and women together, pedaling their bikes or walking at a leisurely pace. They wear various colored sun hats, with spare sunglasses attached to the brims to prevent "snow blindness." Their travel shoes are, of course, light and durable. Additionally, they wear jeans, shorts, plaid shirts, and printed jackets, in all the colors of the rainbow. No matter how they dress, they must bring four-season or at least two-season clothing, because the high-altitude climate is changeable, often combining spring, summer, autumn, and winter in a single day. The temperature difference between day and night is extreme, and the temperature at the mountain top and the mountain foot can also differ greatly. Adding a small amount of food and drink, their travel bags are quite full and cannot be as lightly packed as Chinese tourists.

I noticed that their foreheads, golden hair, and black beards are all covered with thick highland dust. Their faces and arms are beginning to turn red—the strong ultraviolet rays of the sun affect the skin color of different races equally. However, they do not want to use walking sticks (although there are plenty of discarded sticks by the roadside that could serve as such). Those heading towards Lhasa, except for not prostrating themselves in full-length kowtows, are almost like Tibetan pilgrims. Some people, in places they deem worthy of lifelong remembrance, take out their cameras to take group photos or capture distinctive landscapes and scenery. Others, more creatively, in places they deem worthy of "live recording," take out their portable tape recorders and record themselves. On the top of Jia'er Mountain, I saw someone proudly saying into the recorder: "It is now the year, month, day, hour, and I am standing on the top of Jia'er Mountain, which is over 5,000 meters high in western China..." Then, with great emotion, they describe the mountain terrain, the road, and their own feelings. After recording, will they take it back to slowly edit into an article, or share the joy with friends and family, or add it as an indispensable proud chapter to their autobiography? I think it could be all of the above.

The vast and beautiful Tibetan Plateau has such a great attraction. It is said that a Swiss old man with paralyzed lower limbs is ambitious enough to want to travel in a wheelchair. The Sichuan-Tibet Highway, stretching over 2,000 kilometers, will surely make the tourists' journey worthwhile. Look, in the Bomê area, a sea of peach blossoms is in full bloom, the trees on the Sejila Mountain are dense with pines and cypresses, cowhide boats float on the Nyang River, and the Jinsha River splashes waves ten miles long. In the vast Bangda Grassland, flocks of wild ducks nest; the Nyainqêntanglha Lake is dyed green by the surrounding forests; the cliffs on both banks of the Nu River are a thousand feet high; the Damala Mountain Road is like a giant snake without a head or tail; giant boulders, as large as houses, stand at the site of a landslide. Such unique scenery contains countless hints from nature.

Equally astonishing is that there are so many martyrs' pavilions, martyrs' monuments, and martyrs' graves along the highway. They stand like a constellation of stars guarding the highway. This reminds us of the troops entering Tibet and the road construction army, with their dauntless heroism, overcoming countless difficulties, and taking the battle cry of "liberating Tibet, unifying the mainland, and consolidating the border defense" as a powerful spiritual pillar. In this land ruled by wind, rain, hail, and snow, they built a rainbow bridge over a thousand miles. Their achievements on the windy and snowy plateau will be immortal.

The spirits of the martyrs, together with Mount Everest, stand tall between heaven and earth, guiding the way for future generations.

    川藏路上
    汪承栋
    在成都至拉萨的川藏公路上，我不知往返多少次了，今年头一回遇到些不远万里的异邦游客。这些莎士比亚和居里夫人故乡的客人，马拉多纳和海曼的兄弟姐妹，路易·艾黎和小泽征尔的同乡，有的从成都沿公路向西直奔拉萨，有的则反向而行；一个个兴致勃勃，闪动着好奇和惊异的眼睛。
    这些异邦游客，有乘车游览的，坐着舒适的旅游车，或坐着跑长途的公共汽车，也有少数坐在可能是“招手牌”的车上（实在走不动了，央请司机带一程）：大多是些上了年岁和偶感不适的旅人。其次是骑自行车的，在成都或拉萨买辆车，到了目的地便处理掉。更多的还有徒步跋涉，凭一双铁腿丈量万水千山。后两者全是身强力壮的青壮年。
    他们三五成群，男女结队，不紧不慢地蹬着车，走着路。头戴各色各样的遮阳帽，帽沿勒着一副备用的墨镜，以防“雪盲”。旅游鞋不用说都很轻便耐磨。此外，牛仔裤、短裤、花格衬衫和印字罩衣，红红绿绿的七色俱全。不管怎样穿着，反正不能拉下四季或简化成两季——的服装，因为高原气候多变，常常一天之内综合春夏秋冬；白天黑夜温差极大，山顶山脚寒暑也不相同。再加上少量吃的喝的，旅行包就很充实，无法像中国游客那样轻装行进了。
    我发现，他们额前的鬈发，金黄的披肩，黑胡胡的络腮胡子上，全涂染了浓重的高原风尘。脸和臂膀开始发红——强烈的日光紫外线，对不同种族的肤色一视同仁。但他们不愿拄拐杖（尽管可作拐杖的丢在路旁的木棍多得很）。朝拉萨方向走的，除了没有一步一拜地磕等身长头以外，几乎和朝圣的藏胞一样。有的人在他们认为值得终身铭记的地方，取出照相机合影留念，或拍下富有特点的湖光山色。有的别出心裁，在他们认为应该“实况录音”的地方，取出微型收录机，自播自录。在雀儿山顶，我就看见有人对着录音者不无自豪地说：“现在是×年×月×日×时，我站立在海拔5000多米的、中国西部的雀儿山顶……”然后极富感情地叙述这儿的山势怎样，公路如何，自己的心绪又如此这般……。录音以后，是带回去慢慢整理成文，或让亲友分享欢乐，或是为自传增添不可遗漏的骄傲的一笔？我想，都可能兼而有之。
    寥廓壮美的西藏高原，她的诱惑力居然如此巨大，听说有位下肢瘫痪的瑞士老头，雄心勃勃地想推着轮椅漫游。而川藏公路这条长达2000多公里的人间彩虹，定会使观光者不虚此行。看吧，波密地区燃烧着一片桃林，色霁拉山松柏蔽天，尼羊河上牛皮船逐浪深浮，金沙江激溅十里浪花；在辽阔的邦达草原，栖息着成群野鸭；然乌湖被树林染得碧绿碧绿；怒江两岸万丈峭壁；达马拉的盘山公路犹如一条不见首尾的巨蟒；泥石流遗址屹立起久经风霜的大如房屋的巨石。这种特异的景致，蕴藏着大自然的万千暗示。
    同样令人震惊的是，公路两旁竟有那么多的烈士亭、烈士碑、烈士墓，他们像璀璨的星群环伺着公路。这使我们回忆起进藏部队和筑路大军，以大无畏的英雄气概，克服重重困难，以“解放西藏，统一祖国大陆，巩固边防”的战斗口号作为强大的精神支柱，在这为狂风暴雨冰雹雪沙所统治的世袭领地里，架起了千里长虹。他们在风雪高原创造的业绩，足以彪炳千古。
    烈士的英灵，同珠穆朗玛峰一起巍然矗立在天地之间，昭示来者。
