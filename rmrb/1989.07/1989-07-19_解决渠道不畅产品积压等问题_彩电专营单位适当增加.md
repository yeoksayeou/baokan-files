Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 19th.

To address issues such as channel congestion and product backlog in the specialized retail of color TVs, the State Council has approved a joint notice from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce and the State Planning Commission. The notice, issued recently, is titled "Regarding the Appropriate Increase in Color TV Specialized Retailers."

The notice stipulates that county-level and above supply and marketing cooperatives, as well as relatively large township supply and marketing cooperatives that have been operating for more than two years, have a good reputation, and meet the conditions for after-sales service, repair, replacement, and return, are permitted to engage in the retail business of color TVs. Additionally, large collective-owned department stores in cities and companies within the China Friendship Stores system, such as Friendship, Overseas Chinese, and Foreign Ship Supply Companies (stores), are also allowed to engage in the retail business of color TVs.

The notice also permits some units to engage in the wholesale business of color TVs, but this is limited to wholesale transactions with color TV retail units within their own system that have been approved.

The notice requires local authorities to strictly issue color TV specialized retail permits in accordance with the above regulations and not to arbitrarily expand the scope. At the same time, it emphasizes the need to strengthen the supervision and management of color TV business activities.
