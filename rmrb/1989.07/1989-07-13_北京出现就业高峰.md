    Beijing Faces Employment Peak

    According to relevant departments, Beijing City this year requires employment for various types of school graduates, demobilized soldiers, and transferred military cadres, totaling approximately 130,000 people. This is the highest employment peak since 1983. However, due to a significant reduction in the number of workers recruited by state-owned enterprises, the situation of "difficult employment" has emerged.

    To address this, Beijing City has taken measures to facilitate employment: for newly established urban collective enterprises that absorb unemployed youth, tax incentives continue to be provided; for urban unemployed individuals who work in township enterprises, the retirement and pension social insurance system is implemented to alleviate their concerns; support and guidance are provided for urban unemployed individuals to seek employment on their own, encouraging individual business operations and the establishment of private enterprises.

    北京出现就业高峰
    据新华社北京7月12日电  （记者夏俊生）据有关部门介绍，北京市今年要求就业的各类学校毕业生、复员退伍军人、部队转业干部等各种人员约13万多人，是1983年以来的一个就业波峰。但是，由于国营企业的招工人数大大减少，出现了“就业难”的局面。
    对此，北京市采取措施努力安排就业：对新办的安置待业青年的城镇集体企业，继续在税收上给予一定的优惠；到乡镇企业就业的城镇待业人员，实行退休养老社会保险制度，解除他们的后顾之忧；支持和指导城镇待业人员自谋职业，鼓励从事个体经营，开办私营企业。
