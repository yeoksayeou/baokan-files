On a summer night, two border guards, Xiong Hongbin and Luo Yongfu, quietly took their positions by the Shenzhen River, vigilantly watching the surroundings. Soon, three figures appeared, moving stealthily towards the border. They had entered the restricted border area.

“Who are you?” Xiong shouted.

The three men were startled but quickly regained their composure. “We dropped our border permits and came to find them,” one of them said. A tall man stepped forward, feigning familiarity as he patted Xiong on the shoulder. “It’s you! Don’t hide it from me. We have some mangoes from the other side, and we came to pick them up.” He handed over 200 yuan, saying, “Here, take this first. If you need more money later, just take it.”

To keep them calm, Xiong took the money. The tall man was overjoyed and quickly took out a lighter, lighting it and waving it towards the sea.

A small boat approached the shore, and the people on board unloaded eight video recorders, muttering, “Military-civilian cooperation, big profits.” Before they could finish speaking, Xiong slammed the 200 yuan on the ground in front of them and sternly said, “Go, to the company headquarters!”

“You…”

“We are border guards.”

“There are too many such incidents,” said Deputy Political Commissar Wu of the regiment. “Escaped individuals and smugglers all try to use money or women to bribe our sentries, but they won’t succeed.”

On the same day in the morning, a small boat from Hong Kong approached the shore. As it neared, two men in “space suits” looked around cautiously. Seeing no one, they quietly disembarked. Hidden nearby, soldiers Li Jianzhuang and Wang Jun quickly stepped out of their positions and questioned them. The two men said they were looking for friends. The soldiers refused to let them pass. One of them immediately took out a wallet and handed it to the soldiers, “Let’s be friends.” Li opened the wallet, revealing over ten thousand Hong Kong dollars and some Renminbi. This made them even more vigilant, and they threw the wallet back at the Hong Kong residents, shouting, “Go, to the company headquarters!”

Upon inspection, it was found that the “space suits” the two Hong Kong residents were carrying contained white powder (drugs).

In January of this year, the streets of Shatoujiao in the middle of Zhongyuan Street were bustling with activity. Among the thousands of tourists being checked, soldier Chen Caijun noticed that a young man’s documents were suspicious. After questioning, the man admitted that his documents were fake but still insisted on entering the town to shop, quietly slipping 200 yuan into Chen’s pocket. Chen sternly reprimanded him, and the man took out another 300 yuan, pushing it into Chen’s hand. Chen pushed the money back, saying, “You’ve made a mistake. We don’t accept toll money.” He then handed the young man over to the platoon leader who was on duty there. Not long after, a Hong Kong resident entered from Shatoujiao. Dressed fashionably, he walked with an air of indifference. However, the attentive Chen Caijun noticed that his stiff body and quick eyes were out of sync, immediately stopping him for inspection. It turned out he had over a hundred calculators wrapped around his body. When the truth was revealed, the Hong Kong resident begged for mercy and tried to give Chen 100 Hong Kong dollars. Chen sternly said, “Who wants your money? Please come to the company headquarters.”

    深港边防线上的故事
    武通
    初夏的一天深夜，执勤在深圳河畔的武警战士熊宏斌和罗永富悄悄进入哨位，警惕地注视着周围的动静。不一会，3个人影忽隐忽现地朝界河走来，进入边防禁区。
    “干什么的？”熊宏斌大吼一声。
    3个人大吃一惊，但立即镇静下来作答：“边防证掉了，是来找边防证的。”其中一位高个子走上前来，假装亲热地拍着熊的肩膀说：“原来是你呀，不瞒你说，对方有点芒果过来，我们来接。”随手递过来200元，“先拿着用，以后要用钱再拿。”
    为了稳住他们，熊宏斌把钱接了。高个子大喜，迅即掏出打火机打着，朝海面方向摇了摇。
    一条小船靠近岸来，船上的人搬下8部录像机，嘴里还念念有词：“军民合作，大大发财。”话音刚落，熊宏斌“拍”的一声，把200元摔到他们面前，厉声说：“走，到队部去！”
    “你们……”
    “我们是武警战士。”
    “类似这样的事，太多了”，支队吴副政委说，“外逃人员，走私分子，都想用金钱、或女色在我们哨兵身上换取通行证，但没有门。”
    就在同一天上午，香港海面一条小船朝我方驶来。快靠岸时，船上两个手挽“太空服”的人东张西望，见没人后就悄悄爬上岸来。隐蔽一旁的战士李健壮和王军快步走出哨位，上前盘问。两人说是来“找朋友”。战士不许通行。其中一人立即掏出钱包递给战士，“交个朋友吧”。小李打开钱包，里面是10多张千元面额的港币，还有人民币。这使他们更加警惕起来，把钱包丢还港客，大喝一声：“走，到队部去。”
    经检查，原来两位港客手挽的“太空服”内装着白粉（毒品）。
    今年1月的一天，中英街沙头角镇桥头车水马龙。在检查成千上万游客证件时，战士陈才俊发现一青年所持证件有疑。经盘问，持证人承认证件是假的，但仍要求进镇购物，并悄悄把200元人民币塞进小陈口袋。小陈严厉批评他，他又掏出300元塞到小陈手里。小陈把钱推回去，说：“你看错人了，我们不收买路钱。”说着，把青年交给执勤到这里的指导员带走了。事隔不久，一位港客从沙头角入境。他穿戴时髦，走路时旁若无人。但细心的陈才俊一眼看出此人僵硬的身体和他那灵活的眼睛很不协调，立即要他停下接受检查。原来他身上缠满上百个计算器。事情败露，港客求饶，并塞给陈才俊百元港币。小陈严肃地说：“谁要你的钱，请到队部走一趟。”
