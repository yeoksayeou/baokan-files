People's Daily, London, July 9th, Reporter Chen Te'an:

West German tennis player Boris Becker and Steffi Graf won the men's and women's singles titles respectively at the 1989 Wimbledon Tennis Championships.

The men's singles final was between Becker and Swedish player Stefan Edberg. Before the final, Becker had won seven matches, including a semifinal victory over Czechoslovakia's Ivan Lendl with a score of 7-5, 6-7, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3. Edberg, on the other hand, defeated American player John McEnroe in the semifinals with a score of 7-5, 7-6, 7-6. It was reported that McEnroe had injured his left shoulder during a four-hour quarterfinal match against Wilander and had to withdraw from a doubles match due to the injury before participating in the men's singles final.

The third-seeded Becker, after more than three hours of intense battle, defeated Edberg with a 3-0 score, reversing the result of last year's match. This was his third Wimbledon title.

In the women's singles final, Graf defeated American player Martina Navratilova with a score of 6-2, 6-7, 6-1, securing the women's singles championship.

On July 9th, the Wimbledon Tennis Championships also decided the men's and women's doubles champions, and the mixed doubles semifinals were held.

In the men's doubles, Australians John Fitzgerald and Swede Anders Järryd defeated Americans Robert L. Litch and Jim Pugh with a score of 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, 7-6. In the women's doubles, Czechoslovakia's Jana Novotná and Helena Suková defeated the Soviet Union's Larisa Savchenko and Natalia Zvereva with a score of 6-1, 6-2.
