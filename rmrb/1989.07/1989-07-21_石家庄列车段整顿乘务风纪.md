Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on March 18th titled "Playing Cards Delays Opening of Car Doors." After investigation, the situation described in the letter is true. We have decided to take the following measures:

The train conductor and the individuals involved in the violation were both severely criticized. The monthly production bonus of the four individuals who played cards was withheld, and they were fined 20 yuan each according to the regulations for serious violations of service discipline during duty.

This incident was reported to the entire section, and a discussion on rectifying service discipline was held in all the service teams within the section. The section organized relevant personnel to inspect and implement the "strict prohibition of drinking alcohol, playing mahjong, or playing cards during duty" policy.

    石家庄列车段整顿乘务风纪
    你报3月18日刊登了读者来信《玩牌耽误开车门》。经调查，来信所反映的情况属实，我们决定采取以下措施：
    对列车长和违章人员分别作了严肃批评，并免发4名玩牌者当月生产奖，按乘务中严重违反乘务纪律罚款规定，每人被罚款20元。
    将此事通报全段，在全段各包乘组开展了整顿乘务风纪大讨论，段里组织有关人员，检查落实“严禁在乘务中饮酒打麻将、打扑克”的制度。
