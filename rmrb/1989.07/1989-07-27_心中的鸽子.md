    The Dove in My Heart
    Lǐ Měiguī

    You carry a budding love, cooing a joyful song, soaring over fences, piercing through walls, scattering messages along the way, smiling at the farmhouses and alleyways.

    A smile is not the final farewell; you call out to ideals every day, seeking the continuation of love, bringing new stories and new hopes time and time again.

    When you encounter storms, you rest, yet still chirp and dream. You were born with a single goal, using passionate flames and lingering raindrops to stitch the path of love, flapping your tireless wings.

    Dove, you fly into everyone's heart, fluttering your strong wings on the heart's door, leaving behind a long poem of praise in people's memories.

    心中的鸽子
    李美桂
    你衔着一枚泛绿的爱，啁啾一支欢乐的歌，飞掠樊篱，穿越围墙，沿途洒下一串串信息，微笑于农舍街坊。
    笑靥不是最后的离别，你每天呼唤理想，寻觅爱的延续，一次次捎来新的故事，新的希冀。
    遇到风雨，栖息着，仍叽叽喳喳地幻想。你生来目标如一，用热烈的光焰和缠绵的雨丝缝缀感情的途程，扇动不疲倦的翅膀。
    鸽子，你飞进每个人的心窝，在心扉上扑闪着矫健的翅翼，留给人们记忆中一组长长的赞美诗行。
