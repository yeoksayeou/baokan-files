Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th.

The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army today issued a notice titled "On Launching a Campaign to Learn from the Heroic 'Guardians of the Republic'." The full text of the notice is as follows:

At the moment of decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Central Military Commission signed an order on June 30, awarding Liu Guangen, Wang Qifu, Li Qiang, Du Huaiqing, Li Dongguo, Wang Xiaobing, Xu Rujun, Cui Guozheng, Ma Guoxuan, and Wang Jinwei the honorable title of "Guardians of the Republic." This is the highest honor bestowed by the Party and the people upon the heroes who defended the Republic, a full affirmation of the historic achievements of the people's army in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, and the greatest encouragement and inspiration for the martial law troops and all officers and soldiers of the entire military.

The ten martyrs who have been awarded the title of "Guardians of the Republic" have added a batch of luminous names to the roll of heroes in our army, names that will be remembered by all ethnic groups in the country for generations to come. In these ten martyrs, the deep patriotism of the Chinese nation and the selfless dedication of our army in this era are concentrated, embodying the boundless loyalty of the people's army to the Party and the people, the righteous spirit of "dying for the country and dying for the people" of our army's officers and soldiers, and the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Chairman Deng. They are indeed the heroes of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, the good sons of the Party and the people, the outstanding soldiers of the new era in the style of Lei Feng, and the outstanding representatives and models for learning from among the broad masses of our army's officers and soldiers. The General Political Department calls on all Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, all officers, civilian cadres, soldiers, and workers and family members of the entire military to learn from the heroic deeds and sublime thoughts of the ten "Guardians of the Republic," deeply implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, carry the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot through to the end, and push the revolutionization, modernization, and regularization of our army forward, making new contributions to the country and the people.

Learn from the heroic "Guardians of the Republic" as examples, remember the Party's teachings, maintain a firm and correct political direction, seriously study the important speeches of Chairman Deng of the Military Commission, unswervingly adhere to the four cardinal principles, clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, resolutely safeguard the authority of the new leadership collective produced by the Fourth Plenary Session, and unswervingly implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, strengthen Party leadership and ideological and political work, maintain the high stability and unity of the troops, and in politics, thought, and action, maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee.

Learn from the heroic "Guardians of the Republic" as examples, remember the mission of our army, regard the interests of the people as paramount, extensively and deeply carry out activities to support the government and love the people, model the execution of the country's laws, decrees, and policies, strictly observe the "three major disciplines and eight points for attention," enthusiastically do good deeds for the people, and with practical actions for the benefit of the country and the people, set up more Lei Feng images in the capital and throughout the country.

Learn from the heroic "Guardians of the Republic" as examples, inherit and carry forward the fine traditions of our army, maintain the political character of hard work and selflessness, love the army and cherish military prowess, devote oneself to national defense, be unconcerned with personal gain, maintain integrity, fear no hardships and sacrifices, and carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism.

Learn from the heroic "Guardians of the Republic" as examples, obey orders, follow instructions, be loyal to duty, be highly responsible, maintain revolutionary vigilance at all times, thoroughly investigate and severely crack down on counter-revolutionary rioters, eliminate evil to the root, leave no hidden dangers, and complete the martial law mission perfectly; at the same time, seriously implement the "Regulations on the Construction of Grassroots Units in the Army," comprehensively strengthen grassroots construction, do a good job in education and training, and continuously improve the combat effectiveness of the troops.

The ten martyrs sacrificed their lives for the country, using their blood and lives to uphold and defend the four cardinal principles, and to expose and criticize bourgeois liberalization. Widely launching a campaign to learn from the heroic "Guardians of the Republic" is an important measure to deeply implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. All levels of Party committees and organs should strengthen the leadership of the campaign to learn from the martyrs. Mid- and high-level cadres should set an example and take the lead. All levels of Party and Youth League organizations should, in combination with actual conditions, propose requirements, adopt various forms, and carry out the campaign to learn from the martyrs in a way that is both lively and practical. Make the spirit of the "Guardians of the Republic," which is "the interests of the motherland are paramount, and for the motherland, one is willing to give up everything," known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts, truly becoming a powerful driving force for the construction of our army, the safeguarding of national interests, the maintenance of long-term stability, and the realization of the four modernizations.
