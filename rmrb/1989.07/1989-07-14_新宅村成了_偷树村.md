Villagers from Xinzhai Village in Yangxi Town of our county have made a habit of stealing timber from neighboring villages, with the scope of theft extending to Jiande and Chun'an counties, covering over 10,000 mu of land and stealing more than 5,000 cubic meters of timber. Among the affected villages, Gaofeng Village in Yangxi Town has suffered the most. The 4,000 mu of forest on the border with Xinzhai Village has been almost completely destroyed, with 4,000 cubic meters of timber stolen.

Some villagers from Xinzhai not only brazenly steal timber from neighboring villages but also tie up and beat village officials and forest rangers. Over the years, dozens of forest rangers and village officials from nearby villages have been injured. For instance, four out of six village officials from Gaofeng Village have been beaten by timber thieves. Last August, the party secretary of Gaofeng Village was injured in his right foot while protecting the forest by villagers from Xinzhai. Before this incident was resolved, the village head and deputy village head were severely beaten by two other timber thieves.

Xinzhai Village is densely populated but lacks land, with poor economic conditions, relying on subsidized grain every year. However, it is a "poor village with rich households." Currently, out of the 386 households in the village, most have built two-story houses with wooden floors. Every household has electric fans and bicycles, many have televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines, five households have cars, and over 70 households have tractors. The household with the most savings has over 50,000 yuan.

According to reports from villagers in Gaofeng, whenever a household in Xinzhai builds a new house, a simple call is all it takes for ten or more people to "work hard" overnight to gather the necessary timber.

In this small mountain village, over 90% of the villagers have stolen timber. These people have developed a habit of stealing timber but lack the initiative to plant trees. The county forestry bureau, in an effort to help Xinzhai Village afforest barren hills, has invested 210,000 yuan since 1986 to collaborate with the village on tree planting. As a result, over 80% of the tree-planting tasks were contracted out to migrant workers from other places.

The head of the county forestry police station said, "We frequently receive reports about villagers from Xinzhai stealing timber. Every year, 30% of our station's efforts are spent dealing with this village." Once, Xu from Xinzhai and others stole 26 logs, which were seized by the forestry police station, leading to a 15-day detention. However, soon after being released, he gathered five others to steal 126 logs from Xianxiang Township's Chunlian Village and other places. Economic penalties imposed on some timber thieves do not deter them. They pay the fines and continue stealing. For example, in April 1987, the forestry police station discovered that 1.03 cubic meters of timber in a new house built by Shao from Xinzhai Village was stolen, resulting in a fine of over 1,000 yuan. However, shortly after, Shao sneaked into Gaofeng Village to steal timber and was fined again. In March of this year, Shao and others drove a tractor to Gaofeng Village to steal timber. Over the years, the county forestry police station and relevant departments have repeatedly cracked down on timber thieves from Xinzhai Village, but with little effect.

### 新宅村成了“偷树村”

    新宅村成了“偷树村”
    我县洋溪镇新宅村的村民盗伐邻村木材已成历史恶习，偷盗范围涉及到建德、淳安两县，盗伐面积达1万多亩，盗伐林木5000多立方米。其中，洋溪镇高峰村受害最为严重。这个村与新宅村交界的4000亩山林基本被毁光，4000立方米木材被盗伐。
    新宅村一些村民不但明目张胆盗伐邻村的木材，还捆绑殴打邻村的干部和护林人员。这些年来，邻近几个村庄的护林人员与村干部，数十人被打伤。如高峰村6名村干部就有4名挨过盗伐者的刀棍。去年8月，高峰村党支部书记为了护林，右脚被新宅村村民砍伤。此事未了，村长、副村长又被另两名盗伐者打成重伤。
    新宅村人多地少，经济条件差，年年吃返销粮。但是“穷村富户”。目前，全村386户人家，大部分都盖了装有地板的两层楼房，家家有电风扇、自行车，许多家庭还有电视机、电冰箱、洗衣机等家用电器，有5户买了汽车，70多户买了拖拉机，存款最多的已逾5万。
    据高峰各村群众反映，新宅村谁家盖新房，只要打个招呼，十几个人“辛苦”一晚上，一栋新房的木材就有了。
    这个小小的山村，90％以上的村民偷过树。这些人偷树上了瘾，可种树却没有积极性。县林业局为了帮助新宅村绿化荒山，1986年以来，先后投资21万元，与这个村合作造林。结果，80％以上植树任务是承包给外地民工完成的。
    县森林派出所所长说：“我们经常收到有关新宅村村民盗伐木材的报告，每年全所要用30％的精力对付这个村。”有一次，新宅村许某等人，偷得木材26根，被森林派出所查获后拘留15天，但放回没多久，他又结伙5人到下涯乡春联村等地偷得木材126根。对一些盗伐者给予经济处罚，他们也不在乎。他们一边交款，一边又偷。如1987年4月，森林派出所发现新宅村村民邵某新建的一幢房子中，有1.03立方米的木材是偷来的，邵被罚款1000多元。可是事隔不久，邵窜到高峰村偷盗林木，再次受到罚款处理。今年3月，邵某等人又开着拖拉机去高峰村偷木材。几年间，我县森林派出所和有关部门多次打击新宅村的盗伐木材者，但收效甚微。
