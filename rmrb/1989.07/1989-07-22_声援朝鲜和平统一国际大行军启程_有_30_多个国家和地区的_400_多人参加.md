Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 20th - Reporter Xu Baokang reports: An international peace march in support of the peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula, consisting of over 400 people from more than 30 countries and regions, held a "departure ceremony" at Mount Paektu, the northernmost point of the Korean Peninsula, on July 20th. The marchers will proceed on foot towards Panmunjom, the military demarcation line, and ultimately reach Mount Hallasan, the southernmost point of the Korean Peninsula.

This news was announced by the International Committee for the Support of Korean Peaceful Reunification at a press conference last night.

At the press conference, Reverend Jeong Yi-Ryeol, a standing committee member of the International Committee, emphasized that the purpose of the "International Peace March" is to support and advocate for the struggle of the Korean people for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, and to end the divided state of Korea as soon as possible. He also strongly demanded that the United States and the South Korean authorities open the gates of Panmunjom to allow the "International Peace March" to pass through the military demarcation line smoothly.

    这一消息，是声援朝鲜和平统一国际筹委会昨天晚上在记者招待会上宣布的。
    在记者招待会上，国际筹委会常委郑已烈牧师强调说，举行“国际和平大行军”的目的，是为了支持和声援朝鲜人民争取朝鲜自主、和平统一的斗争，早日结束朝鲜分裂的局面。他还强烈要求美国和南朝鲜当局敞开板门店大门，以便使“国际和平大行军”的队伍顺利通过军事分界线。
