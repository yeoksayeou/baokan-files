The discipline inspection departments at various levels in Guizhou Province have been diligently investigating cases of party members violating discipline. In the first half of this year, the province handled 1,197 cases of party members violating discipline, with 1,023 party members receiving punishments. Among them, 452 party members were expelled from the party.

At the beginning of this year, the Guizhou Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission proposed that the province's discipline inspection work should focus on investigating cases of party members violating discipline, with a key emphasis on combating corruption. In the first half of this year, the province investigated cases of party members violating discipline, with a noticeable increase in the proportion of embezzlement and bribery cases, which rose by 25.2% compared to the same period last year. The number of major and important cases increased by 31% compared to the same period last year. Additionally, a number of cases involving the misuse of power for personal gain, moral degradation, and law enforcement violations were also investigated.

Provincial Party Committee Standing Committee member and Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission Secretary Liu Hanzhen, along with other leaders of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, frequently visit the grassroots level to supervise and inspect, and participate in case handling. Under their leadership, discipline inspection cadres across the province have been invigorated, working diligently to embody the principle of strict party governance through facts and practice.

    贵州千余违纪党员受处分
    本报贵阳7月9日电　记者潘帝都报道：贵州省各级纪检部门认真查处党员违纪案件，今年上半年全省共查处党员违纪案件1197起，有1023名党员受处分，其中452名党员被清除出党。
    今年初，中共贵州省纪委提出，全省纪检工作要以查处党员违纪案件为中心，重点是惩治腐败。今年上半年，全省查处的党员违纪案件中，贪污受贿案比例明显上升，比去年同期增加25.2％；大案要案比去年同期增加31％；还查处了一批以权谋私、腐化堕落、执法犯法方面的案件。
    省委常委、省纪委书记刘汉桢及省纪委其他负责同志经常下基层督促检查，参与办案。在他们的带动下，全省广大纪检干部振奋精神，艰苦工作，用事实和实践来体现从严治党的方针。
