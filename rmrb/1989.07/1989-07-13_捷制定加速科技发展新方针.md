    Czechoslovakia has recently conducted a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of its technological development situation and has formulated a new policy to accelerate technological progress.

    According to reports from Czech newspapers, the Czechoslovak Communist Party's plenary session held in mid-June pointed out that Czechoslovakia's technological development lags significantly behind that of developed countries. In cutting-edge fields such as electronics, automation engineering, information engineering, biotechnology, and new materials, it lags behind by approximately 15-20 years. The labor productivity, which serves as an indicator of overall economic efficiency, is only half that of developed countries.

    The plenary session identified three main reasons for the technological lag: first, the current command-based economic management system has constrained technological development; second, the excessive variety of industrial products (accounting for about 70% of global industrial product varieties) has dispersed research efforts; third, technological development has long relied 90% on domestic research capabilities, with international cooperation limited to Comecon countries, thus failing to keep pace with the rapid global technological advancements.

    In response to these issues, the plenary session formulated a new technological development policy: first, to promote technological development, economic reform measures must be vigorously implemented to create favorable conditions for the application of technological achievements; second, the economy should be more open, actively promoting exchanges and cooperation with countries around the world, especially by introducing advanced technologies and processes from Western developed countries and developing production cooperation and joint ventures with them; third, the investment structure should be adjusted to allocate more funds to the modernization of machinery and equipment; fourth, the number of state-assigned research tasks should be significantly reduced, with the number of tasks in the next five-year plan decreasing from the current 540 per year to 160, in order to concentrate efforts on key research areas; fifth, the application of technological progress achievements should be encouraged, and a flexible pricing policy should be implemented for products with advanced technological levels; sixth, the management system of research institutions should be reformed. Currently, specific measures are being implemented nationwide in Czechoslovakia to carry out the policy and measures formulated by the central plenary session.

    捷制定加速科技发展新方针
    新华社布拉格7月12日电  （记者刘天白）捷克斯洛伐克最近对本国科技发展状况进行了全面深入的分析，并制定了加速科技发展的新方针。
    据捷报刊报道，捷克斯洛伐克共产党在6月中旬举行的全会指出，捷科技发展同世界发达国家相比明显落后，在电子技术、自动化工程、信息工程、生物工程、新材料等尖端项目方面，约落后15—20年，作为衡量整个经济效益情况的劳动生产率，只相当于发达国家的一半。
    全会认为，造成科技落后有3个方面的原因：一是迄今的指令性的经济管理体制束缚了科技的发展；二是工业产品品种过多（约占世界工业产品品种的70％），使科研力量分散；三是科技的发展长期以来90％靠本国的科研力量，同国外的科技合作也仅限于同经互会国家，因而同世界飞速发展的科技进步潮流脱节。
    针对上述状况，全会制定了新的科技发展方针：一、要推动科技发展，必须大力贯彻经济改革措施，为运用科技成果创造良好的条件；二、使经济更加开放，积极发展同世界各国的交流与合作，特别是要从西方发达国家引进先进的技术工艺，同它们发展生产协作和建立联合企业；三、改变投资结构，把资金更多地用于机器和设备的现代化方面；四、大大减少国家指定的科研任务，在下一个5年计划中，将由目前每年540项减至160项，以便集中力量攻克重点课题；五、鼓励运用科技进步成果，对具有先进技术水平的产品实行灵活的价格政策；六、改革科研单位的经营体制。目前在捷全国正在具体贯彻中央全会所制定的上述方针和措施。
