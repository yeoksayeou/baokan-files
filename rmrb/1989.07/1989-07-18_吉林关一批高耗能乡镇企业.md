Jilin Shuts Down a Batch of High-Energy-Consuming Township Enterprises

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 18 — In the first half of this year, Jilin Province decisively shut down 97 high-energy-consuming township enterprises, freeing up 190 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

At the beginning of this year, after a thorough investigation, the Jilin Provincial Township Enterprises Bureau decided to close a number of township enterprises that waste energy and raw materials. The focus is on developing industries with low input, high output, and increased social effective supply. Liaoyuan City has already shut down 17 high-energy-consuming electric-fused magnesium factories. Panshi County's Sancheng Township originally had 6 smelting plants, and now 5 of them have been shut down.

After the adjustment, the structure of township enterprises has been optimized, and the decline in the benefits of township enterprises has been curbed.

    吉林关一批高耗能乡镇企业
    新华社长春7月18日电　吉林省今年上半年果断关停了97户高耗能乡镇企业，让出电力1.9亿千瓦小时。
    今年初，吉林省乡镇企业局经过摸底调查，决定关掉一批浪费能源和原材料的乡镇企业，发展低投入、高产出、增加社会有效供给的行业。辽源市已关停了17户高耗能的电熔镁厂。磐石县三棚乡原有6户冶炼厂，现已关停5户。
    调整之后，乡镇企业结构优化，抑制了乡镇企业的效益滑坡。
