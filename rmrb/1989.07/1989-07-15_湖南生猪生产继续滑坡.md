    Pig production in Hunan Province is still on a downward trend.

    According to a recent survey by the Hunan Provincial Department of Agriculture in six cities and counties, including Changsha, in 18 counties and cities, the pig inventory from January to April this year, except for a slight increase in Jingzhou County in the Jingzhou region, has decreased to varying degrees in the remaining 17 counties and cities. The decrease in pig inventory is mainly due to a reduction in the number of specialized pig farmers and key households, and an increase in the number of empty pens. The reasons for the decline include insufficient funds, a reduction in grain production last year, and most importantly, the continuous rise in feed and piglet prices, while the purchase price of live pigs has fallen.

    湖南生猪生产继续滑坡
    本报长沙电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省当前生猪生产仍呈继续滑坡趋势。
    据最近湖南省农业厅对长沙等6地、市18个县、市的调查，今年1至4月，生猪存栏除怀化地区的靖州县略有增长外，其余17个县、市均有幅度不同的下降。存栏猪减少，主要是养猪专业户、重点户减少，空栏户增加。滑坡的原因，除资金不足、去年粮食减产外，最主要的是饲料和仔猪价格不断上涨，活猪收购价格下跌。
