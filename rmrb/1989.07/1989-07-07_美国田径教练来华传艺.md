To enhance sports exchanges between China and the United States, a group of American track and field coaches, led by renowned long jump and triple jump coach Dean Hayes, will depart from here tomorrow for Beijing. They will teach Chinese track and field athletes techniques in long jump, high jump, short-distance running, long-distance running, and hurdles.

The group consists of five coaches, three of whom are African American. They all serve as track and field coaches at five universities, including Brown University. The coaches are: high jump coach Steve Kooksee, long-distance running coach Jim Fisher, hurdles coach Kenneth Gibson, and short-distance running and relay coach William Miller. Fifty-one-year-old Dean Hayes served as the coach of the U.S. track and field team during the 1988 Seoul Olympics, helping to train track and field star Carl Lewis.

At a reception held tonight at the Chinese Embassy's cultural section in the United States, Hayes said, "We are very happy to accept the invitation from the Chinese Sports Commission to exchange track and field techniques in China. We believe this visit will be beneficial to sports exchanges between the United States and China." Chinese cultural counselor Wang Yingmin pointed out that this is the first group of American track and field coaches to visit China since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, and it is of great significance. He hopes that the American coaches' short-term visit will be a complete success.

    美国田径教练来华传艺
    新华社华盛顿七月六日电（记者陆文岳）为增进中美两国之间的体育交流，以著名跳远和三级跳教练迪安·海斯为首的第一批美国田径教练明天将从这里启程前往北京，向中国田径选手传授跳远、跳高、短跑、长跑、跨栏等技术。
    这批美国教练一共五位，其中三位是黑人，他们分别在布朗大学等五所大学担任田径教练。他们是：跳高教练史蒂夫·库克西、长跑教练吉姆·费希尔、跨栏教练肯尼斯·吉布森、短跑和接力跑教练威廉·米勒。五十一岁的迪安·海斯曾作为美国田径队教练参加一九八八年汉城奥运会，帮助训练过田径巨星卡尔·刘易斯。
    今晚，在中国驻美国大使馆文化处举行的招待会上，海斯说：“我们很高兴应中国体委的邀请赴华交流田径技术，我们相信这一访问将有益于美中两国的体育交往。”中国文化参赞王英民指出，这是中美两国建交以来首批赴华的美国田径教练，意义很大。他希望美国教练们的短期访问取得圆满成功。
