Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, July 28th.

    The once barren city of Yinchuan, known for its vast expanses of yellow sand and lack of greenery, has transformed into a city with lush green trees and flowers in bloom throughout the year.

    Located at the eastern foot of the Tengger Desert, Yinchuan used to be a desolate landscape of gray and yellow from late autumn to early spring. In recent years, the Yinchuan municipal government has implemented measures such as drainage and desalination, soil relocation for grass planting, and the combination of tree and shrub planting. The city has prioritized the cultivation of evergreen, drought-resistant, and alkali-resistant trees and flowers, significantly improving the urban ecological environment.

    银川绿树成荫花满城
    据新华社银川七月二十八日电  （记者秦凤桐）昔日“满目黄土满目沙，不见树木不见花”的塞上古城银川，如今绿树成荫，四季见青，三季有花。
    位于腾格里大沙漠东麓的银川市，深秋至仲春，极目四野，一片灰黄。近几年，银川市政府采取排水降碱、移土种草、乔灌结合等措施，突出栽植叶常青、花期长的耐旱、耐碱树木花草，使城市的生态环境大为改观。
