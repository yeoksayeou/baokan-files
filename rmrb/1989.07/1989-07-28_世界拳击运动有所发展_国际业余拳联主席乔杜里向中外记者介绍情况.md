    The Development of Boxing Worldwide
    The President of the International Amateur Boxing Association, Choudhury, Introduces the Situation to Chinese and Foreign Journalists

    BEIJING, July 27 (Xinhua) -- Reporter Miu Lu: Today, the President of the International Amateur Boxing Association, Choudhury, introduced the latest developments in boxing to Chinese and foreign journalists here.

    Choudhury said that, like gymnastics and diving, boxing matches have a considerable degree of subjective judgment by referees. For example, during the Seoul Olympics, there were instances of unfair refereeing in boxing. To eliminate such phenomena, the International Amateur Boxing Association has decided that referees will use computers to make decisions in the future. That is, during the match, each time a boxer lands a punch, the referee below will immediately press the computer button to record the points, instead of relying on memory to tally the score after the match. The computer uses a linked device, and only when all referees press the button simultaneously will the points recorded by each side be valid. Choudhury called this new measure a revolutionary step for boxing. He said that this decision has been implemented since this year's King's Cup International Invitational Tournament and is strictly adhered to in the 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championships currently being held in Beijing.

    Choudhury also announced the latest evidence of the safety of amateur boxing. He said that Johns Hopkins University in the United States has been conducting a million-dollar study since three years ago, regularly monitoring 500 young boxers. The test results show that boxing is far safer than most other sports and generally does not harm the health of the athletes. In addition, he introduced that new gloves and helmets have been developed. Using these new protective gear, the original danger can be reduced by 70%. He said that in future competitions, people may no longer see boxers being knocked down and unable to get up.

    Regarding the question of whether boxing will be canceled from the Olympics, Choudhury revealed that in the foreseeable future, this is not possible. After last year's Olympics, the President of the International Olympic Committee, Samaranch, has expressed on two formal occasions that as long as he is in office, boxing will definitely be an official event of the Olympics. However, he also put forward his own views on this, believing that in the future, the number of boxers participating in the Olympics should be strictly controlled and reduced as much as possible. He said that if there are no restrictions, judging from the current trend, the number of boxers participating in the next Olympics will reach 700, "which is not conducive to the arrangement of matches, nor is it conducive to the media's reporting. More importantly, it will increase the number of times boxers compete in the 16-day Olympic period, exceeding the safety factor provided by medical supervision." He said that unfortunately, his views are not yet recognized by the national and regional Olympic committees, "because people all regard the Olympics as a rare opportunity for a sports festival and want to send more people to participate."

    世界拳击运动有所发展
    国际业余拳联主席乔杜里向中外记者介绍情况
    本报北京7月27日讯　记者缪鲁报道：今天，国际业余拳联主席乔杜里在此间向中外记者介绍了拳击运动的最新发展情况。
    乔杜里说，和体操、跳水运动一样，拳击比赛裁判的临场裁决有相当的主观色彩，比如在汉城奥运会上就出现了拳击裁判执法不公的现象。为了杜绝这种现象，国际业余拳联已决定今后裁判员将使用计算机来判决，即比赛时拳手每击中一拳，立刻由台下裁判按下计算机按钮计入点数，而不再是赛后凭记忆统计，计算机采用联锁装置，只有所有的裁判同时按按钮，各方统计的点数才有效。乔杜里称这一新措施为拳击运动所迈出的革命性的一步。他说，这一决定已从今年的泰王杯国际邀请赛开始实行，正在北京举行的第十四届亚洲业余拳击赛也严格地采用了这一裁判法。
    乔杜里还宣布了业余拳击安全性的最新证据。他说，美国的约翰霍普金斯大学从三年前开始了一项耗资百万美元的检验，定期对500名年轻拳手跟踪监督，试验结果表明，拳击运动远比大多数其它项目更安全，一般不会对选手的身体健康造成危害。此外，他还介绍说，现已有新的手套和头盔被研制出来，用这些新装具比赛，原有的危险性可降低70％。他说，在今后的比赛中，也许人们再也不会看到有拳手被击倒在地爬不起来。
    对于奥运会是否会取消拳击比赛的问题，乔杜里透露道，在可以预见到的将来不会有这种可能。去年奥运会后，国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇曾两次在正式场合表示，只要他在位，拳击比赛就一定是奥运会的正式项目。不过，他也就此提出自己的观点，他认为今后拳手参加奥运会的人数应该严格控制，尽量减少。他说，如果没有限制的话，从目前趋势看，下届奥运会的参赛拳手将达到700人，“这不利于安排比赛，也不利于新闻界的报道，更重要的是，将使拳手在奥运会16天赛期内增加上场次数，超过医务监督所提供的安全系数。”他说，可惜他的观点目前尚不为各国和地区奥委会所认可，“因为，人们都把奥运会视为机会难得的体育盛会，都想多派些人参加。”
