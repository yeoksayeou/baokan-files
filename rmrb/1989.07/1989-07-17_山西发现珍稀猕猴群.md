A group of lively macaques jumping among the trees, playing and foraging, was recently discovered in a nature reserve in Yangcheng County, Shanxi. This is a rare sighting of macaques.

The nature reserve in Yangcheng County covers an area of over 5,800 hectares. The area is characterized by high mountains, dense forests, and flowing streams, making it a picturesque landscape. It was designated as a provincial-level nature reserve in 1983.

Initially, over 100 macaques were found here. In recent years, the government has implemented a series of protective measures, including prohibiting human interference and providing food for the macaques. As a result, the macaques have started to settle down and reproduce, with their population now growing to five groups totaling 210 individuals. The newly discovered macaques, compared to those in the south, not only have larger bodies but also exhibit more aggressive behavior and greater tolerance to cold weather.

According to scientists, macaques typically inhabit regions such as Guangdong, Sichuan, and Yunnan in China. The appearance of such a large number of macaques in the northern Loess Plateau is quite unusual. This discovery holds significant importance for the study of geographical and ecological changes in the northern region.

    山西发现珍稀猕猴群
    本报讯　一群活蹦乱跳的猕猴，在树丛中跳上跳下，嬉戏打闹，觅食玩耍。这是新近在山西阳城县一自然保护区发现的罕见猕猴群。
    阳城县这一自然保护区面积5800多公顷，这里山高林密，流水潺潺，风景优美。1983年被列为省级自然保护区。
    开始这里发现有100多只猕猴，这几年，政府采取了一系列保护措施，禁止人为破坏活动，并给猕猴投放食物，猕猴开始在这里“安居乐业”生儿育女，现在已发展到五群210只。新发现的猕猴，与南方的猕猴相比，不仅体态肥大，而且性情雄悍，耐严寒。
    据科学工作者称，猕猴一般生活在我国广东、四川、云南等地，在黄土高原北部出现这么多猕猴，实属罕见。这对研究北部地理和生态演变有重要意义。
