Jiangsu province has established a network for public reporting, with procuratorial organs receiving over 20,000 tips in a year, recovering nearly 20 million yuan in economic losses.

    Reporting from Nanjing, July 27 — Reporter Sun Jian: Since last July, procuratorial organs at all levels in Jiangsu province have established 115 reporting centers or offices in 117 municipal and county (district) procuratorates, staffing them with over 400 full-time personnel dedicated to reporting work. This has created a network throughout the province that facilitates public reporting, effectively striking at economic criminals.

    Over the past year, procuratorial organs at all levels in Jiangsu have received over 23,000 tips from the public. Based on these tips, procuratorial organs across the province have initiated over 1,100 cases, arrested 538 individuals, and recovered over 19.5 million yuan in economic losses for the state and collective entities.

    Among the 1,411 individuals who have been indicted, 97 are party and government officials.

    While handling reporting tips and investigating reported cases, procuratorial organs at all levels in this province have established a series of measures to ensure the healthy development of reporting work.
