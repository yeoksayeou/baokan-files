While urban residents are queuing up to buy grain due to insufficient supply points, the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Grain Bureau knowingly violated regulations and misappropriated 2.573 million yuan of production development funds to build a guesthouse. The regional disciplinary committee and the regional supervision bureau have taken serious action to address this issue. The main responsible officials, Bureau Director Fang Yu and Deputy Director Mo Tiande, have received party warnings and administrative demerits, respectively.

In early 1987, the Guangxi Grain Bureau decided to build a guesthouse with an initial investment of 500,000 yuan and a construction area of 2,067 square meters. After construction began, the investment and construction area were increased to 3.4 million yuan and 7,006 square meters, respectively. Of this amount, 2.573 million yuan was misappropriated from the production development funds in violation of financial discipline.

The Guangxi Regional Party Committee and the regional government decided to impose sanctions on the Guangxi Grain Bureau for its actions, which violated prohibitions and corrupted the atmosphere. The main responsible officials were punished; the guesthouse building, which had mosaic exterior walls, marble-clad interior columns, and all-aluminum window frames, was confiscated and sold. The proceeds from the sale will be used for grain processing production and the construction of urban and rural grain sales outlets.
