With the enthusiastic assistance and arrangements of the International Telecommunications Company, reporters recently had the opportunity to visit Chicago to understand the local industrial situation and its economic ties with China. The three industrial companies we visited vary in size, but they all share a common trait: a firm resolve to tap into the Chinese market.

Viewing China with a Long-Term Perspective

A century ago, Amoco Oil Company was a refinery in the American Midwest. Today, it has grown into an international petrochemical conglomerate with operations in over forty countries and substantial assets, ranking seventh among major American oil companies in terms of total assets.

Martin Plunger, the director of the overseas business department at the company's headquarters, told us that opportunities and oil and gas resources in the United States are increasingly limited. Therefore, the company established business relations with China as early as the mid-1970s. In the 1980s, they began drilling in the South China Sea and eventually discovered oil. The three or four wells that have been drilled so far indicate abundant reserves. He said that the discovered oil is low-sulfur heavy oil, presenting new challenges for large-scale extraction. The company has been conducting trials on new extraction technologies for the past year. Currently, they are in the evaluation stage and may decide by this summer whether commercial extraction is feasible. He hopes for a positive outcome, followed by negotiations with the China National Petroleum Corporation to establish a joint venture. If everything goes smoothly, production could begin in 1994.

When discussing overseas investment risks, Plunger said, "Long-term investment is a characteristic of the oil extraction industry, and risks are always present, but we are looking for long-term opportunities, at least for twenty to thirty years." He gave examples, saying that the company's investments in Egypt have experienced several ups and downs; a few years ago, Canada nationalized the industry, seizing a significant portion of their shares, but later Canada changed its policy, and now both sides are cooperating well. Therefore, in conducting business in China, we also have a long-term perspective. Even if there are some difficulties at present, we have not changed our plans because we believe in the trend and prospects of China's economic cooperation with the outside world.

"China Will Be an Important Market in the World"

In the southern suburbs of Chicago, in the town of Lyons, we visited the headquarters of Molex Corporation. In 1938, the 82-year-old John Krepill founded this company, which initially produced plastic toys. Today, Molex is a world-renowned company specializing in the production of high-quality connectors. The company, with fewer than 5,900 employees, is known for its extensive regional distribution and flexible management. It operates 42 factories in 16 countries across five continents, producing 30,000 different types of connectors for various electronic devices. Its sales currently rank third in the industry nationwide. A few years ago, Molex began building a factory in Shenzhen, China, and now 80 to 85 percent of that factory's products are sold in Hong Kong, with the rest sold on the mainland.

Two departments at the company's headquarters left a deep impression on us. One is the international department, which communicates global demand and sales information; the other is the design department, dedicated to researching and developing new technologies and products. John Krepill's son, Frederick Krepill, the company's vice president, spoke about the company's international business strategy. He said that when their annual sales were only a few million dollars twenty years ago, he went to Japan to develop the market. Later, the company gradually expanded its business to Europe, Southeast Asia, and other regions. Their secret to success is: choosing the right location and timing to provide high-quality products to the market nearby. Krepill said, "Today's world is becoming smaller and smaller, so one must have a global perspective to be competitive worldwide. In the future, unless one becomes a global enterprise, one cannot survive."

When discussing relations with China, this vice president said that while considering the lower labor costs in China, the main consideration for investing and building a factory there is to be close to potential Chinese customers and to contribute technologically to China. Currently, their factory in China is small, but they plan to double its size in the future. "We firmly believe that China will be an important market in the world, and we must go there!"

Continuing Joint Ventures in China

Abbott Laboratories is an international pharmaceutical company with annual sales of $4.9 billion. During our visit to the company's headquarters, we coincidentally marked the first anniversary of the signing of the joint venture contract between Abbott Laboratories and Ningbo Pharmaceutical Factory, "Ningbo Abbott Biotechnology Co., Ltd." After touring the company's pharmaceutical production facilities, we met with James O'Ganbo, the vice president of the strategy department, in the office building. He had just returned from China, where he participated in the board of directors meeting of the joint venture, and eagerly shared his experiences visiting China over the past few years.

In the fall of 1985, O'Ganbo and his colleagues made their second trip to China for a survey and found that the changes in China were attractive to the company. Later, they decided to build a factory in Ningbo through a joint venture. After formally signing the contract on June 29 last year, construction began this year and is scheduled to start production in January next year, achieve profits in three years, and then continue to add investments; all products will be exported by Abbott. O'Ganbo personally devoted a lot of time and effort to this joint venture.

He emphasized that 40 percent of Abbott's products are sold overseas, and the company is interested in China because, from a long-term perspective, China is a large market, and Abbott should establish its own foothold there. Therefore, as early as June 11, O'Ganbo issued a statement: Abbott, as the other party in the cooperation, will fulfill its obligations in the joint venture in China and continue the joint venture. His statement received a positive response from the Chinese side. On the anniversary of the contract signing, the business leaders of both sides exchanged warm congratulations.

### “我们需要中国市场”——访芝加哥三家美国公司

    “我们需要中国市场”
    ——访芝加哥三家美国公司
    本报记者张启昕  仓立德
    在国际传语公司的热情协助和安排下，记者近日得到机会前往芝加哥采访，了解当地的工业状况及其同中国的经济联系。我们走访的三家工业公司规模有大有小，但坚定不移地要开拓中国市场，则是它们的一个共同特点。
    用长远的眼光看待中国
    阿莫科石油公司一百年前原是美国中西部的一家炼油公司，现已发展成国际性的石油化工联合企业，业务遍及四十多个国家，资金雄厚，总资产在美国各大石油公司中名列第七。
    公司总部海外业务部主任马丁·普朗格对我们说，目前美国国内的油气资源和商业机会愈来愈有限，因此公司早在七十年代中期便与中国建立了业务关系。八十年代在中国南海开钻，不久终于发现了石油。已经打出的三、四口井表明，潜在的蕴藏量是丰富的。他说，发现的石油是低硫重油，给大规模开采带来新问题。一年来公司一直在从事开采新技术的试验。目前已进入评估阶段，可能在今年夏末就能决定是否具有商业性开采价值。他希望能得出积极结论，然后同中国石油公司谈判成立合资企业。如果一切顺利，可望于一九九四年投入正式生产。
    在谈到海外投资风险时，普朗格说，“长期投资是石油开采业的特点，风险总会有，但我们寻找的是长远机会，至少二三十年。”他举例说，公司在埃及的投资曾经历几起几落；几年前加拿大实行国有化，曾收回我们的相当部分股份，但后来加拿大改变了政策，现在双方合作得很好。因此，在中国开展业务我们同样具有长远目光。即便目前可能有些困难，但我们没有改变既定计划，因为我们相信中国与外部经济合作的趋向和远景。
    “中国将是世界的重要市场”
    在芝加哥南郊的莱索镇，我们访问了莫莱克斯公司的总部。八十二岁的老约翰·克雷比尔先生于一九三八年创建这家公司时，它是个生产塑料玩具的小厂。现在的莫莱克斯则是专门生产各种优质连接器的世界性公司。全公司职工不多（五千九百人），却以地区分布广、经营方式灵活而名闻遐迩。它在五大洲十六个国家开设有四十二家工厂，生产三万种不同种类的连接器，用于各种电子器材。其销售额目前在全美国行业中居第三位。两三年前，莫莱克斯开始在中国深圳建厂，现在该厂的产品百分之八十至百分之八十五销往香港，其余在大陆出售。
    公司总部有两个部门给我们的印象十分突出。一个是国际部，沟通世界各地需求与销售的信息；一个是设计部，致力于研究与开发新技术、新产品。老约翰的儿子、公司副总裁弗雷德里克·克雷比尔在谈到公司的国际经营战略时说，二十年前当他们的年销售额只有几百万美元时，他就去日本开发市场。后来公司又逐步将业务扩大到欧洲、东南亚等地。他们的成功诀窍是：选择好地点和时机，就近为市场提供高质量产品。克雷比尔先生说，“当今世界已变得越来越小，因此必须有全球眼光，使自己在世界具有竞争性。在未来，除非成为全球性企业，否则就不能生存。”
    在谈到与中国的关系时，这位副总裁说，我们在中国投资设厂虽然考虑到那里的劳动成本较低，但更主要的考虑是能接近潜在的中国顾客，能在技术上对中国作出贡献。目前我们在中国的工厂很小，计划今后将把规模扩大一倍。“我们深信，中国将是世界的重要市场，我们必须到那里去！”
    继续在中国的合资企业
    雅培生物制药公司是一家年销售额达四十九亿美元的国际性医药公司。我们采访公司总部时，恰逢雅培公司同中国宁波制药厂签订“宁波雅培生物技术有限责任公司”合资企业合同一周年。参观了公司的医药生产设施之后，我们在办公楼里拜访了公司策略部副总裁詹姆·奥甘波先生。他于五月下旬刚刚从中国参加合资企业董事会后返回，一见面便兴致勃勃地介绍几年来的访华经历。
    一九八五年秋，奥甘波和同事们第二次去中国考察，发现中国的变化对公司有吸引力，后来决定同宁波合资建厂。去年六月二十九日正式签约后，今年已开始破土动工，预定明年一月投产，三年后赢利，然后再继续追加投资；全部产品由雅培负责出口。奥甘波本人对这项合资企业花费了很多时间和心血。
    他强调雅培的全部产品有百分之四十销往国外，该公司之所以对中国感兴趣，因为从长远着眼中国是个大市场，雅培应该在中国建立自己的立足点。所以，奥甘波早在六月十一日便发表了一项声明：雅培作为合作的另一方将履行它在中国承担的合资义务，继续合资企业。他的声明得到中方的积极反响。在合同签订周年之际，双方企业家互致热情洋溢的祝贺。
