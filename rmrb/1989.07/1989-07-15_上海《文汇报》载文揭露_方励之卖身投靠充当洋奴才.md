Wenhui Bao, Shanghai, July 12th

The Shanghai Wenhui Bao published an article exposing Fang Lizhi, who has always portrayed himself as a "democracy fighter," as a traitor who has sold out to foreign powers.

The article lists the facts of Fang Lizhi's anti-communist and treasonous activities this year. At the beginning of this year, Fang Lizhi initiated a signature campaign demanding the release of the current counter-revolutionary Wei Jingsheng. When U.S. President Bush visited China, Fang Lizhi tried to force his way into the banquet, but was rejected by the relevant authorities for violating protocol. He then held a press conference to deliver anti-communist and treasonous speeches. With the outbreak of the student unrest this year, Fang Lizhi saw his opportunity. He openly advocated for political platforms such as "socialism has led China into a dead end," "the only way out for the mainland is capitalism," and "the four cardinal principles must be abandoned." He also incited students to "make a big fuss, spread it nationwide, and force them to comply." Regarding the student unrest, from short-term plans to long-term goals, from march routes to slogans, Fang Lizhi meticulously observed and directed. He even served as an aide to foreigners, urging them to withdraw funds and apply pressure on China, aiming to collapse China politically and economically. His wife, Li Shuxian, frequently appeared at Tiananmen Square, personally encouraging the fasting students to "dare to starve to death," and "dare to self-immolate." Ultimately, they turned a peaceful Beijing into chaos, leading to the counter-revolutionary riot.

The article concludes by stating that Fang Lizhi, through his words and actions, has created an excellent advertisement for his treachery. Through this advertisement, people see a self-portrait of a "yellow-skinned boy," revealing the ugly soul of a traitor.

    上海《文汇报》载文揭露
    方励之卖身投靠充当洋奴才
    本报讯  7月12日上海《文汇报》发表文章揭露，一贯以“民主斗士”自居的方励之，其实是一个卖身投靠的洋奴才。
    文章列举了方励之今年以来从事反共卖国的事实。今年初，方励之发起签名活动，要求释放现行反革命分子魏京生；美国总统布什访华时，他挤扁了脑袋往宴会上钻，由于违反惯例，遭到我有关部门的拒斥，他又搞什么记者招待会，发表反共卖国的演说；今年学潮乍起，方励之觉得时机已到，不仅透底端出了诸如“社会主义置中国于死胡同”、“大陆的唯一出路就是资本主义”、“必须放弃四项原则”之类的政治纲领，而且鼓动学生“把事情闹大，闹到全国去，逼迫他们就范。”对于学潮，从近期计划到长远目标，从游行路线到标语口号，方励之都细心察之。他甚至干脆为洋人当幕僚，鼓动洋人抽走资金，给中国施加压力，在政治和经济上搞垮中国。他的老婆李淑娴则频繁出没于天安门广场，亲自给绝食的学生打气，鼓动他们“要敢于饿死”，“要自焚”。最后，把一个好端端的北京搅得乌烟瘴气，直至发生反革命暴乱。
    文章最后说，方励之用言论和行动，为自己完成了一篇绝好的卖身广告。透过这则广告，人们看到的是一个“黄脸干儿”的自画像，一个卖国贼的丑恶灵魂。
