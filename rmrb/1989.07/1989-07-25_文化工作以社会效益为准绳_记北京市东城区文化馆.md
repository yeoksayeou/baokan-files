Economic prosperity and various ideological challenges coexist, which is a unique characteristic of the era brought about by reform and opening up. How should cultural institutions, which take spiritual civilization construction as their mission, develop in such a complex environment? The Cultural Center of Dongcheng District, Beijing, has found the correct answer through practice.

Revenue Generation for Better Development of the Cause

“Without money, nothing can be done, but focusing solely on money won't do it right.” In the context of the commercial economy, which has spawned the mindset of “everything for money,” the Cultural Center has its own understanding.

In 1984, the impoverished Cultural Center of Dongcheng District started the Ditan Spring Festival Cultural Fair with a loan of 8,000 yuan. With over 400 exhibition booths, more than 50 performance stages, and dozens of entertainment spots, the fair presented Beijing residents with a variety of performances, traditional snacks, New Year's goods, flower shows, riddles, stamp collecting, bird training, and games. It attracted millions of citizens, and the gross income from a single fair amounted to tens of thousands of yuan.

Money brought hope to this poor institution. “The Cultural Center, which used to struggle to pay salaries, can now afford to increase some benefits”; “Having found the way to make money, future activities won't be a worry”… Various comments made the leaders of the Cultural Center realize that the urgent task was not to distribute the money but to unify the understanding. Money comes from activities and should be reinvested into activities. Without developing the cause, employees might have money but lose their drive. On this issue, the public and the leaders finally reached a consensus. Everyone agreed to use a small portion of the income as a welfare fund, with the rest being used to purchase equipment and develop the cause.

After several years of accumulation and development, the Cultural Center, which used to struggle to provide each employee with a desk, now has cars, video and editing systems, high-level stage audio and lighting, and more than a dozen remote communication devices. Nearly 50 employees, 20 of whom have been able to study their professions full-time, have a deeper understanding of the relationship between social benefits and economic benefits. Whether it's a revenue-generating activity or a small-scale propaganda event that loses money, social benefits are always the guiding principle. Over the years, they have achieved an average of more than 600 activities, 500 performances, and guidance for nearly 400,000 people per year, winning praise from municipal and district leaders and the public. Director Chen Ping said that establishing a forward-looking spirit and eliminating the bad habit of “everything for money” is a common choice made by all employees of the Cultural Center through serious contemplation in the practice of deepening reform.

In Dedication, Self-Realization

A collective that has a correct understanding of money can unleash boundless energy, and its value to itself and society is immeasurable. In the contemplation of this proposition, the Cultural Center found a feasible path.

Among the staff, there are performers from professional art troupes, graduates from art schools, and individuals whose performances or works have won awards and been reviewed by Chairman Mao. However, upon arriving at the Cultural Center, they faced the task of organizing and guiding the cultural activities of tens of thousands of residents in 10 streets across the district. The feeling of being underutilized made many people find the work here uninteresting. However, society needs culture, the masses yearn for art, and improving national quality cannot do without the work of grassroots cultural centers. The leaders of the Cultural Center felt that it was necessary to quickly establish a management mechanism that respects and reasonably utilizes talents in order to mobilize everyone's love for art. They decided to focus on activities and promote the spirit of the Cultural Center, providing equal opportunities for everyone to showcase their aspirations and talents, so that personal value and social value can be realized together.

Since 1984, the Spring Festival Cultural Fair, Art Festival, Summer Evening Party, Holiday Garden Party, Mass Cultural Series Competition, as well as music, dance, opera, fine arts, stamp collecting, and photography competitions and training have become institutionalized, continuing throughout the year. Each employee began to re-evaluate their abilities and potential in the midst of busy activities, and the hot reality of the work awakened the sense of mission in the artists.

The comprehensive nature of the Cultural Center's work made everyone feel that a single specialty was not enough to meet the multi-level, multi-channel characteristics of mass culture, and that one must be proficient in all aspects. Thus, a vocal coach who had cultivated many musical talents ventured into the world of folk flower shows and organized a flower show association; a traditional opera coach also befriended folk artists. Every Spring Festival Cultural Fair, from inviting performers to organizing performances, from selling tickets to ensuring safety, from setting up exhibition booths to dismantling performance stages, a team of over 40 people took on the heavy responsibility of serving a million people.

Everyone admits that working here is both tiring and low-paying, but no one wants to leave. Everyone says that what they value is the full utilization of their talents and a sense of fulfillment.

    文化工作以社会效益为准绳
    ——记北京市东城区文化馆
    刘茜
    经济繁荣与各种思想挑战并存，是改革开放赋予时代的特殊规律。以精神文明建设为己任的文化单位在纷纭复杂的环境中如何发展？北京市东城区文化馆从实践中找到了正确的答案。
    创收是为了更好地发展事业
    “没有钱办不成事，光为钱办不好事”。在商品经济发展衍生出“一切向钱看”的心态时，文化馆便有了自己的认识。
    1984年，一贫如洗的东城区文化馆靠着8000元贷款办起了地坛春节文化庙会。400多个展览棚、50多个演出台、十几个游艺点，把精彩的演出、丰富的传统小吃、各色年货以及花会、灯谜、集邮、驯鸟、游艺……全都展现在北京人面前，吸引了百万市民，一个庙会下来，毛收入竟达十几万元。
    钱，给这个穷单位带来了希望，
  “过去连工资都难以开出的文化馆，如今增加点福利在情理之中”；“摸到了赚钱的门道，今后搞活动不愁赚不到钱”……各种议论使馆领导意识到，当务之急不是分钱，而是统一认识。钱从活动中来，还应回到活动中去，不发展事业，职工有了钱却失去了活力。在这个问题上，群众与领导最终取得了共识。大家同意将少量收入作为福利基金，其余全部用于添置设备、发展事业。
    经过几年的积蓄和发展，过去连每人一张办公桌都轮不上的文化馆，如今有了汽车，摄像及编辑系统，高级舞台音响、灯光，还有十几套遥控通讯设备……全馆近50名职工中20余人得以脱产进修专业。从个人利益的小圈子里超脱出来的人们，对社会效益与经济效益的内涵有了更深刻的认识。无论是能创收的活动，还是赔钱的小型宣传，社会效益始终是工作的准绳。几年来，他们以平均每年开展活动600余项、演出500余场和辅导近40万人次的成绩，赢得了市、区领导和群众的赞誉。馆长陈平说，树立向前看的正气，杜绝“一切向钱看”的陋习，是全馆职工在深化改革的实践中经过认真思辨作出的共同选择。
        在奉献中实现自我
    一个对钱有了正确认识的集体，如果能焕发出冲天的干劲，其自身与社会的价值则不可估量。在这个命题的思辨中，文化馆找到了一条可行道路。
    在职工队伍中，有来自专业文艺团体的演员，有毕业于艺术院校的尖子，有人的演出、作品获过奖，有人的表演受到过毛主席的检阅……但来到文化馆，他们面临的是组织、辅导全区10个街道几十万居民开展业余文化生活的任务。大材小用的困扰使很多人感到这里的工作索然无味。然而，社会需要文化，群众呼唤艺术，提高民族素质离不开基层文化馆工作。馆领导感到，必须尽快建立起尊重人才与合理使用人才的管理机制，才能调动起大家“热爱艺术的天性”。他们决定抓活动、促馆风，为每个人提供施展抱负和才华的均等机会，使个人的价值与社会价值共同实现。
    1984年以来，春节文化庙会、艺术节、消夏晚会、节日游园、群众文化系列大赛以及音乐舞蹈、戏曲美术、集邮摄影等多项比赛与培训形成了制度，一年四季接连不断。每个职工在紧张的活动中开始重新审视自己的能力和潜力，火热的现实工作唤醒了文艺工作者的使命感。
    文化馆综合性的业务需求，使大家感到单一的专业应付不了多层次、多渠道群众文化的特点，必须“十八般武艺”样样在行。于是，培养出大量音乐人才的声乐辅导员闯进了民间花会的世界，组织起花会协会；曲艺辅导员还与民间艺人交上了朋友。每年春节文化庙会，从请演员到组织演出，从卖门票到安全保卫，从搭展销棚到拆演出台，40余人的集体承担了为百万人服务的重任。
    谁都承认，在这里工作既累又拿钱少，然而没有一个人想调离，大伙儿说，图的是人尽其才，心情舒畅。
            领导者的作风
    这样的评价来之不易。既要有奖惩分明的制度，又要有保护每个人积极性的措施。对于领导者而言，除具备开创精神、政治水平外，还要有甘于吃苦、乐于奉献的气魄。几年来，5位馆领导每天的工作时间不是8小时而是10小时以上，奖金、福利从来排在后面，而重活儿、累活儿、脏活儿始终干在前头。50多岁的书记为解决群众住房，一家三口至今挤在12平米的小房里；馆长的母亲身患绝症，却从未因此请过假。他们认为，在社会主义初级阶段，领导与群众的区别应在这里。群众认为，只有具备这样的领导作风，才能产生富有魅力的集体。几年来，北京市精神文明标兵的殊荣始终在这里盘桓。
