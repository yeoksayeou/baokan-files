In recent years, many places in China have seen the rapid construction of high-end, luxurious, and even ultra-luxurious tourist hotels, which have garnered significant attention. However, the construction of mid-range and low-end hotels has been relatively less emphasized. Ideally, the development of tourist hotels should strike a balance between high-end and mid-to-low-end options. The current imbalance, where high-end hotels are more prevalent, can be attributed to a period during which we emphasized frugality in national construction. While reform and opening up have indeed improved our prosperity, given the vast size of our country and its relatively weak economic foundation, the principle of frugality in all endeavors must remain steadfast for many years to come.

Some may argue that the tourism industry is unique. They might say that since tourism is an industry involved in the international redistribution of national income, it must compete by spending more money. Additionally, they might point out that the tourism industry is highly reliant on public relations, necessitating a certain level of business interactions and hospitality, which naturally requires more spending. It is true that "to take, one must first give." Developing the tourism industry can attract foreign exchange and create wealth, but this does not mean that we must spend large sums of money, nor does it imply that every region should do so. It is evident that many luxurious hotels are built in areas with sparse tourist traffic. Due to low occupancy rates, these hotels not only fail to generate profits but also incur losses, leading to waste.

Spending large sums of money does not necessarily guarantee big profits or significant achievements (although there are indeed examples of successful ventures). Sometimes, spending moderately or even frugally can also yield substantial results. The tourism industry provides such examples. For instance, in the early 1950s, we used simple facilities combined with high-quality service to host the first batch of international friends visiting New China, marking the beginning of the development of China's tourism industry. Similarly, in the late 1970s, at the dawn of reform and opening up, the nine managers of Shenzhen's Xili Lake Holiday Village invested just 60,000 yuan to purchase 30 camping tents, 10 boats, 10 bicycles, and 20 barbecue grills, thus launching the tourism business in the special economic zone. This initiative received high praise from overseas tourists. Such examples are numerous and have become legendary.

It is also important to note that not all tourists visiting China are millionaires who can afford to stay in luxurious or ultra-luxurious high-end hotels. In developing China's unique tourism industry, we must consider the needs of the majority of tourists. While luxurious hotels should be available, the focus should be on developing mid-to-low-end hotels and ensuring high-quality service. In the context of opening up to the outside world, the tourism industry serves as a crucial window for showcasing China's spiritual civilization. Therefore, we should, to the greatest extent possible, highlight the diligent and frugal spirit of the Chinese people, fully utilize China's rich tourism resources, and serve tourists from all over the world. This approach will help establish a good reputation and credibility for China's tourism industry.

In developing tourism, we should prioritize thrift over luxury. This principle should also be applied to other industries.

    办旅游尚俭莫崇奢
    瓯亮
    近几年，国内很多地方高级的豪华的乃至超豪华的旅游宾馆拔地而起，引人注目，而中低档宾馆相对来说建得少了。旅游宾馆建设本应高档与中低档搭配合宜，现在之所以一重一轻，一多一少，比例不那么合适，与我们一段时间内强调勤俭建国少了不无关系。改革开放的确带来了富裕程度的提高，但是因为国家大，底子薄，勤俭办一切事业的原则几十年都不能丢。
    有人会讲，旅游业情况特殊。理由一是，旅游业属于进行国际间国民收入再分配的一种行业，要参与竞争，就得多掏点钱；二是，旅游业系公共关系密集度高的行业，必要的业务交往和应酬接待常不可少，花钱多点无可厚非。的确，“将欲取之，必先予之”。发展旅游业可以吸收外汇，创造财富，固然先须花点本钱。但是，花本钱并不是说必须花大钱，更不是提倡各个地方都花大钱。人所共见，很多豪华宾馆建在客源冷僻处，因为客房利用率太低，不但不能赚钱，反而入不敷出，造成浪费。
    花大钱未必能够赚大钱、办大事（当然确实赚了大钱的也不乏其例），而有时花中钱、花小钱也能办成大事。旅游业就有这样的事例。例如，50年代初期，我们曾经用简易的设施加上优质服务，接待过第一批来新中国旅游的国际友人，写下了新中国旅游业发展的开篇文章。又如，70年代末期，在改革开放的大潮刚刚兴起的时候，深圳西丽湖度假村的9名管理人员，只用6万元的投资，买了30顶露营帐篷、10条小船、10辆自行车、20个烧烤炉，就办起了特区旅游事业，得到海外游客的交口称赞。这样的事例，不胜枚举，传为佳话。
    还要强调的一点是，到中国来旅游的人中，并非都是百万富翁，并非都住得起豪华乃至超豪华的高级宾馆。我们发展中国特色的旅游业，要为大多数旅游者着想，豪华的宾馆要有，但更多的是要发展中低档宾馆，保证优质服务。在对外开放中，旅游业是显示我国精神文明建设的重要窗口，因此，应在一切可能的范围内突出地表现我国人民克勤克俭的精神风貌，充分利用我国丰富的旅游资源，为来自世界各地的旅游者服务。这样，才有利于树立我国旅游事业的良好形象和信誉。
    办旅游尚俭莫崇奢，办其他事业也宜如此。
