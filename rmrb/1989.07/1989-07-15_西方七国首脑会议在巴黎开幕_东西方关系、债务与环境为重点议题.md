Yesterday afternoon, the heads of state from the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy, France, and West Germany, along with the President of the European Commission, gathered in the glass pyramid hall of the Louvre to take a group photo, marking the official commencement of the 15th Summit of the Seven Western Nations.

This summit is the third time it has been held in France, following previous gatherings in 1975 and 1982. The event coincides with the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, and the leaders of various countries arrived in Paris early to participate in the commemorative activities and engage in preliminary discussions, laying the groundwork for the summit.

This morning, the seven heads of state convened their first round of talks at the newly constructed Porte de Versailles building in Paris. Subsequently, they held a plenary session attended by members of each country's delegation. As in previous years, the key members of each delegation include the foreign ministers, finance ministers, and personal advisors to the heads of state.

According to information released before the summit, the main topics of discussion include:

East-West relations. The seven heads of state will exchange views on current security, defense, and disarmament issues related to East-West relations. They will also focus on the relationship between Eastern and Western Europe. The United States and some Western European countries hope to achieve a unified stance on the reform processes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Hungary, to pursue outcomes that align with Western interests.

The debt issue in the Third World. This summit may emphasize finding practical solutions to reduce the debt burden on Third World countries. Prior to the summit, the United States, France, Japan, and the World Bank have proposed specific plans, leading Western public opinion to have high expectations for progress on this issue.

Before the summit, some suggested holding a North-South dialogue conference. It is difficult to determine whether the seven heads of state will prioritize this and reach a unified understanding through consultations.

Environmental protection will be included in the summit's agenda for the first time, with in-depth discussions expected on issues such as forest conservation and preventing ozone layer depletion.

Yesterday afternoon, the foreign and finance ministers of each country held separate meetings to discuss the summit declaration and the global economic situation. It is reported that before the summit concludes on the 16th, political and economic declarations, as well as other relevant documents, will be issued. These may cover issues such as the situation in the Middle East, Southern Africa, Latin America, Western economic inflation, monetary policy, counter-terrorism, drug trafficking, human rights, and the situation in China.

    西方七国首脑会议在巴黎开幕
    东西方关系、债务与环境为重点议题
    本报巴黎7月15日电  记者张启华报道：昨天下午，美国、加拿大、日本、英国、意大利、法国、联邦德国等7国首脑和欧洲共同体委员会主席聚集卢浮宫玻璃金字塔大厅合影留念，以此宣告了第15届西方7国首脑会议正式开始。
    本次7国首脑会议是继1975年、1982年后第三次在法国举行。适逢纪念法国大革命200周年，各国首脑都提前到巴黎参加了法国大革命200周年庆祝活动，并在会前进行了一些交流，为会议作了准备。
    今天上午，7国首脑在巴黎新建的门型大厦举行了第一轮会谈，然后，举行了由各国代表团成员参加的全体会议。同往年一样，各国代表团的主要成员有外交部长、财政部长及首脑们的私人顾问。
    据会前透露出来的消息，这次会议的重点议题有：
    东西方关系。7国首脑除就当前东西方关系涉及的安全、防务、裁军问题交换意见外，将特别研讨东西欧之间的关系。美国和西欧一些国家都希望对苏联与东欧特别是波兰与匈牙利的改革进程有一个统一立场，以期谋取符合西方国家利益的结果。
    关于第三世界债务问题。这次会议可能着重寻找解决减轻第三世界国家债务负担的实际办法。由于会前美国、法国、日本等国以及世界银行方面都提出了一些具体方案，因此，西方舆论对这个问题的进展抱有期望。
    会前有人提出，召开南北对话会议的建议，7国首脑对此是否重视，并通过磋商取得统一认识，现在看来是很难判断。
    环境保护问题将首次列入7国首脑会议的议程，预计会较深入地讨论森林保护、防止臭氧层被破坏等问题。
    昨天下午，各国外交部长及财政部长还举行了专门会议，分别就会议宣言、世界经济形势等问题进行了讨论。据透露，在会议于16日结束前，将发表政治、经济宣言以及其他有关问题的文件，可能涉及中东、南部非洲、拉美地区形势、西方经济通货膨胀、货币政策、反恐怖主义、贩毒、人权以及中国事态等问题。
