The letter stated: "You have written a magnificent scroll and a heroic song with your blood and lives, and your great achievements in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion will be eternal." Several senior members of the Shenyang Municipal Institute of Literature and History created two paintings and three calligraphy works for the martial law troops.

Many calligraphy and painting workers and enthusiasts from all over the country also expressed their common sentiment of "suppressing the rebellion in the capital and thanking the soldiers" by donating calligraphy and painting works to the capital's martial law troops.
