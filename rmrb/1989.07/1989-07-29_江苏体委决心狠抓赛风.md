Jiangsu Sports Commission Determined to Crack Down on Unfair Competition

Newspaper reporter Gao Feng reported from Nanjing on July 28: Jiangsu Provincial Sports Commission Director Lin Xianguo said to our reporter today: "The Jiangsu Provincial Sports Commission has recently proposed the slogan of cracking down for two years to reverse the competition atmosphere. In the future, whether it is provincial competitions or national competitions, we welcome people from all walks of life to help monitor."

Lin Xianguo said: "The preliminary round of the second National Youth Games has exposed some cases of cheating, which has sounded the alarm for us. We, the provincial sports commission, are determined to take this Youth Games as a starting point, to invest effort to reverse the competition atmosphere in sports, to deal with one case as we find one, to be firm and not to be lenient, so that sports competitions can truly reflect the spirit of fair competition and united struggle."

The reporter learned from relevant sources: In the preliminary stage of the second Youth Games, 147 athletes and 5 teams were disqualified in 16 competition projects, which has attracted the high attention of the sports community.

Lin Xianguo said that competition results are indeed important, but spiritual civilization is more important. If athletes' spiritual state is not good and their ideological quality is not solid, it is difficult for them to achieve good results. We have already required all sports schools and teams in Jiangsu to regard ideological education as a major task, and at the same time, require sports departments at all levels to start from provincial competitions, formulate a series of effective methods for organization, inspection, supervision, and reporting, to eliminate the occurrence of cheating. The provincial sports commission is determined to use two years to fundamentally reverse the competition atmosphere in Jiangsu's sports.

    江苏体委决心狠抓赛风
    新华社南京7月28日电　（记者高峰）江苏省体委主任林祥国今天对本社记者说：“江苏省体委最近提出了狠抓两年，扭转赛风的口号。今后不论是省内比赛还是全国性比赛，我们都欢迎各界人士帮助把关。”
    林祥国说：“第二届全国青少年运动会预赛已揭露出一些弄虚作假现象，这给我们敲响了警钟。我们省体委决心以这次青运会为起点，花气力把体育运动的赛风扭转过来，发现一个处理一个，决不手软，决不姑息，使体育比赛真正体现出公平竞赛、团结拚搏的精神。”
    记者从有关方面获悉：第二届青运会预赛阶段，在16个比赛项目中就有147名运动员、5个运动队被取消了资格，这一现象已引起体育界的高度重视。
    林祥国说，比赛成绩固然重要，但精神文明更重要。运动员的精神状态不好、思想品质不过硬，是很难创造出好成绩的。我们已经要求江苏所有体育院校和运动队，把思想教育作为一件大事来抓，同时要求各级体育部门从省内比赛着手，制定出组织、检查、监督、举报等一系列行之有效的方法，杜绝弄虚作假现象的发生。省体委决心用两年的时间，把江苏省的体育运动的赛风根本扭转过来。
