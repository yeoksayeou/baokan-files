A Point of Hope

    Recently, the municipal health bureau of our city conducted a survey of 310 impoverished households in Qixia and Laizhou, discovering that 210 of these households had fallen into poverty due to illness within the family. In 1988, the medical expenses for these impoverished households ranged from a few hundred yuan to several thousand yuan per family. Such high medical costs are not only a burden for impoverished households but also cause financial strain for ordinary farmers. This survey reveals that disease is a serious threat to farmers and a major obstacle to their efforts to become prosperous through hard work.

    Therefore, we hope that relevant departments will adhere to the policy of prioritizing medical work in rural areas, paying attention to and strengthening the capacity for disease prevention and treatment in rural communities.

    改善烟台农村的卫生工作
    最近，我市卫生局调查了栖霞、莱州等地农村310个贫困户，发现其中210户是由于家中有人生病而造成的。1988年，这些贫困户每家医药费的开支少则几百元，多则数千元。这么多的医药费用，不用说贫困户负担不起，就是普通的农户也感到经济压力。这一调查情况表明：病魔是农民面临的严重威胁，是他们勤劳致富的重大障碍。
    为此，希望有关部门坚持把医疗工作的重点放到农村的方针，重视和加强农村防病治病能力。
