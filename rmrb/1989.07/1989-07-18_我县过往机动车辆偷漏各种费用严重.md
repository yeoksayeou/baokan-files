Title: Severe Undeclared Fees by Motor Vehicles Passing Through Our County

	Our county has a serious problem with motor vehicles passing through evading various fees. From late March to late April, the county's transportation management office inspected various motor vehicles passing through our county and found that 420 motor vehicles had evaded road maintenance fees and transportation management fees totaling over 70,000 yuan. Preliminary statistics show that small four-wheel tractors in our county evade paying various fees amounting to approximately 200,000 yuan annually.

	The main reason for motor vehicles evading various fees is that after the traffic supervision work was transferred to the public security department two years ago, the traffic inspection department lacked unified regulations and policies when collecting relevant fees, and also lacked road inspection and checking methods. As a result, they could only watch as vehicles that evaded fees drove away on public roads.

    我县过往机动车辆偷漏各种费用严重
    三月底至四月底，我县运输管理所检查了过往我县的各种机动车辆，发现有四百二十辆机动车偷漏养路费和运输管理费七万多元。据初步统计，我县小四轮拖拉机每年漏交各种费用约二十万元。
    机动车辆偷漏各种费用的主要原因是，前年交通监理工作移交公安部门后，交通稽查部门在征收有关费用时，既没有统一的法规和政策，又没有路查路检手段，只好看着偷漏了费用的车辆在公路上跑了。
