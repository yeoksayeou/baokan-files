Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 3rd.  Correspondent Wu Wenbin reports: On the 280th day of the "Presidential Crisis" in Lebanon, Amal Movement Chairman Nabih Berri held a press conference tonight and announced the formation of the "Lebanese National Front," which includes various national forces and parties in Lebanon.

At the press conference, Berri also announced that the front decided at its recently concluded special meeting: 1. To open all passages into and out of the eastern districts and to reopen Beirut International Airport starting from noon on July 4. 2. The above decision does not include the ports, which will remain in their current state.

It is noted that the above decision was made after a series of diplomatic efforts by the Arab and international communities. The special summit of Arab leaders, which concluded on May 27, entrusted the King of Morocco, the King of Saudi Arabia, and the President of Algeria to form a three-party high committee to assist in resolving the Lebanese crisis within a six-month period.

Berri's announcement tonight indicates that the efforts of the three-party committee to mediate the Lebanese issue have begun to show results.

    三方委员会调解见效  阿迈勒运动结束封锁
    本报大马士革7月3日电　记者吴文斌报道：在黎巴嫩“总统危机”第280天之际，黎巴嫩阿迈勒运动主席贝利今晚在举行的记者招待会上，宣布成立由黎各民族力量和党派参加的“黎巴嫩民族阵线”。
    在记者招待会上，贝利还宣布，该阵线在刚刚结束的特别会议上决定：1、从7月4日中午12点开始，开放所有进出东区的通道，开放贝鲁特国际机场。2、上述决定不包括港口。各港口将维持现状。
    人们注意到，上述决定是在阿拉伯和国际社会进行了一系列的外交努力之后作出的。5月27日闭幕的阿拉伯首脑特别会议委托摩洛哥国王、沙特国王和阿尔及利亚总统组成三方最高委员会，限期半年内协助解决黎巴嫩危机。
    贝利今晚宣布的新决定表明调解黎问题三方委员会的不懈努力已初见成效。
