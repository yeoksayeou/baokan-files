Tianjin is carrying out projects that the people will appreciate, with the city's appearance improving day by day. Price increases are gradually declining, and industrial production is continuing to grow.

The 9 radial road improvement projects that are about to be completed have given Tianjin a new look. These projects total 31.17 kilometers in length, with 3 radial roads—Jintang Road, Fukang Road, and Jinhonghe Street—each 50 meters wide, capable of accommodating 10,000 vehicles per day and night. This will thoroughly improve the situation where motor vehicles and non-motor vehicles share the same lanes in some main urban roads.

Tianjin's retail prices, especially for 21 major food items, are relatively low and stable compared to some neighboring cities. From January to May, Tianjin's price increase rate dropped from 24.4% in January to 18.4% in May.

Including the aforementioned road projects and price stabilization, this year, the Tianjin municipal government has completed 10 projects to improve the lives of city residents. To overcome difficulties such as a lack of funds and materials, early this year, Tianjin Mayor Li Ronghuan repeatedly emphasized the need to carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-reliance. Party members and cadres must take the lead in considering the bigger picture, maintaining discipline, and being honest and dedicated. Statistics show that in the road construction projects, the municipal engineering system organized 30 volunteer labor activities, with over 70,000 participants. Across the city, 92,302 people participated in volunteer price inspections, uncovering 7,124 cases of price violations and effectively curbing illegal price behaviors. From January to May this year, Tianjin's total industrial output value increased by 7.3% compared to the same period last year. The production of items closely related to people's lives, such as soap, white cloth, detergent, and student exercise books, all increased by more than 10% compared to the same period last year. In the second quarter, Tianjin overcame the impact of the turmoil on production, with no enterprises shutting down. In May this year, Tianjin Port's cargo throughput reached 21.25 million tons, an increase of 26.4% compared to the same period last year, setting a new historical high.

    物价涨幅逐月回落　工业生产不断增长
    天津干好让人民满意的实事
    本报天津6月30日电　记者肖荻报道：天津市发扬艰苦奋斗精神，聚精会神干好让人民满意的事，城市面貌日新月异，物价涨幅逐月回落，工业生产不断增长。
    即将竣工的9条射线道路完善工程使天津又展新容。这批工程累计长31.17公里，其中津塘公路、复康路、金钟河大街3条放射线路宽50米，可满足昼夜1万辆机动车的流量，彻底改善市区一些干线机动车与非机动车混行状况。
    天津市零售物价特别是21种主要食品价格，与邻近一些城市相比，较低、较稳。1月至5月天津物价涨幅从1月的24.4％逐月下降到5月的18.4％。
    包括上述公路工程及稳定物价在内，今年，天津市府为改善城市人民生活办了10件实事。为了克服资金、材料紧缺等困难，早在年初，天津市长李瑞环就多次提出必须发扬艰苦奋斗精神，党员、干部要带头讲大局、讲纪律、讲廉洁、比奉献。据统计，在道路工程中，市政工程系统党员带头发动义务劳动30次，人数达7万多人次。全市有92302人次参加义务检查物价活动，查出违纪问题7124件，较好地遏制了价格违法行为。今年1至5月，天津市工业总产值比去年同期增长7.3％。与群众生活关系密切的肥皂、白布、洗衣粉、学生练习本等产量均比去年同期增长10％以上。进入二季度，天津市克服动乱给生产带来的影响，无一家企业停产。今年5月，天津港货物吞吐量为212.5万吨，比去年同期增长26.4％，创历史最高水平。
