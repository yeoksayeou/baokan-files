    **Farmers' Health Check-Ups**

    **Dr. Li's "Confusion"**

    "No pain, no gain." Recently, Dr. Li from the 191st Hospital of the People's Liberation Army in Guigang, Guangxi, noticed that some farmers coming to his clinic had no apparent illnesses. One day, he couldn't hold back anymore and asked a group of farmers from Sanlong Village in Jucheng Township, "You don't have any diseases, right?" The farmers laughed at Dr. Li's serious expression: "If we don't get checked, how will we know if we have any diseases?"

    Dr. Li suddenly understood: the farmers were there for a health check-up.

    Dr. Li told the reporter that he had been working in this hospital for over 10 years. Previously, local farmers didn't consider common ailments like colds, fevers, headaches, and stomachaches as serious issues. When they couldn't bear the pain anymore, they would come to the military hospital for treatment and medication but would often sneak away without paying. Recently, something strange happened: farmers started coming to the hospital for check-ups, spending money freely, seeking treatment with advanced equipment, and asking for prescriptions...

    **"Oh, I've got a 'rich man's disease'?"**

    At first glance, no one would think he was sick. His name is Tan Younian, and he is over 60 years old, with a healthy glow. He said he could eat and sleep well, run and jump, carry a hundred-pound load for ten miles or more. The only problem was occasional dizziness and a fast heartbeat. His grandson, who graduated from high school, insisted on bringing Tan Younian, who thought he had no serious issues, to the hospital.

    After a thorough examination, the doctor found that the old man had too much fat in his body and high blood pressure, diagnosing him with hypertension.

    Tan Younian was shocked. He had never heard of "high blood pressure" in his 60-plus years. He asked, confused, "Why do I have this disease?"

    The doctor explained that as people's lives improved, they consumed more meat, leading to an increase in body fat and consequently higher blood pressure...

    Tan Younian laughed: "I've been poor all my life, and now in my old age, I've got a 'rich man's disease'!"

    **Discovering the "Time Bomb"**

    Su Shangui, a young man from Muge Town, is just over 20 years old. He has come to the hospital for a check-up for the third consecutive year. Although nothing was found in the previous two check-ups, the young man still felt a bit uncomfortable, so he went to the hospital again for a routine check-up. Villagers joked with him: "You're as strong as an ox, what disease could you have? You might as well use that money to add a few more meals!"

    Unexpectedly, the doctor not only performed X-rays, ultrasounds, and gastroscopy but also used a "linear B-ultrasound" scan and found a fingernail-sized "black spot" on his liver. After repeated examinations, the black spot turned out to be liver cancer. The doctor said that if it had been discovered half a year later, he might have been beyond saving.

    The young man was terrified, sweating profusely, and after a long time, he managed to say, "You helped me remove a 'time bomb' buried in my body..."

    When the villagers heard that Su Shangui had liver cancer, they could no longer laugh: "Do we have 'time bombs' in our bodies?"

    **From Poor and Lowly to Rich and Noble**

    Why has health check-ups become a new trend among farmers? The reporter asked Dr. Li, who summarized it in two sentences: "In the past, people were poor and lowly; now, people are rich and noble."

    Just then, more than ten farmers from nearby Binyang and Heng County came for check-ups. The reporter continued the conversation with these farmers. Liang Laoren from Liting Town, Binyang County, said that in the past, their stomachs were never full, and if they died, it was just a few less years of suffering. Now that they have a good life, they want to live a few more years to see the civilized world, so they are always worried about having diseases and only feel at ease after a check-up.

    Farmers from Heng County also had their insights: "We come for check-ups to know our physical condition, arrange production reasonably according to our health, and remove potential diseases early to avoid 'small leaks leading to big collapses.'"

    农民体检

          李医生的“困惑”
    无病不求医。最近一段时间来，解放军驻广西贵港市191医院的李医生，发现到他这里来的部分农民，查来查去也找不出毛病。一天，他忍不住了，问附城乡三龙村结伴前来的苏姓农民：“你们没有什么病呀！”几位农民被李医生那认真的样子逗笑了：“不来检查，怎么知道有没有病呢？”
    李医生一下子明白了：农民是来进行体检的。
    李医生告诉记者，他在这家医院工作已有10余年。原先当地农民不把感冒、发烧、头疼、肚痛等当成是病，实在受不了时，到部队医院看了病拿了药也借故溜走不给钱。近来，怪事来了：农民到医院看病，花钱大方了，有病舍得自己掏钱，还要用高级仪器治疗、开方求药……
      “哟，我得了‘富贵病’？”
    乍一看去，绝对不会觉得他有病。他叫覃有年，今年60余岁，红光满面。自诉说能吃能睡，能跑能跳，身板硬实，百来斤的担子随时能挑十里八里，美中不足的是偶感晕眩，心跳过速。高中毕业的孙子听说后，死拉活拽，硬是把自认为没有什么病的覃有年老汉拉到了医院。
    医生认真检查，发现老汉体内脂肪过多，血压偏高，患上了高血压病。
    覃有年愣住了。活了60余年，他从未听说过“高血压”。他不解地问：“我为什么得了这种病呢？”
    医生介绍说，人们生活好了，吃的肉类食品多了，体内积累的脂肪也就增多，从而导致血压升高……
    覃有年老伯笑了起来：哟，我贱了一世，想不到老了竟得了“富贵病”！
        发现了“定时炸弹”
    来自木格镇的小伙子苏山贵已经20出头，连续两年到医院检查身体，尽管两次都查不出什么来，小伙子总感到有点不舒服，所以第三年又例行公事地去与医生“会面”了。村里人笑他：你健壮如牛会有什么病，还不如将这些钱加几餐菜！
    不料医生给小苏不光进行透视、A超、和胃镜检查而且用“线形B超”透视，竟发现肝脏上有个指头大的“小黑点”。经过反复检查，这小黑点竟是肝癌。医生说，再迟半年发现，怕要魂归西天了。
    小伙子吓得冷汗满身，许久才吐出一句话：“你们帮我挖去了一颗埋在身体里的“定时炸弹”……
    村里的人听说小苏患了肝癌，再也笑不出声了：我们体内有没有“定时炸弹”？
    过去人贫命贱　如今人富命贵
    体检为何成为农民的新时尚呢？记者向李医生请教，他用两句话作了精辟的概括：过去人贫命贱，如今人富命贵。
    正好有邻近宾阳、横县的十多位农民又来体检，记者接过话题与这些农民谈了起来。宾阳县黎塘镇的梁老伯说，以前肚子都填不满，死了拉倒，还少受几年苦；现在过上了好日子，还想多活几年，看看文明世界，因此总担心身体有病，经过检查才放心。
    横县的几位农民又有高见：我们来体检，就是要对自己的身体状况心中有数，根据身体状况，合理安排生产，及早挖去潜在疾病，避免“小漏不补，大漏塌堤”。
