Xiamen Customs and the city's labor, public security, and tax departments have, since last year, strengthened their clean governance efforts in accordance with their specific circumstances.

Xiamen Customs has implemented a system of mutual checks and balances in the various stages of document review, cargo inspection, and release. Each unit is equipped with full-time or part-time inspectors, forming a relatively complete system of internal checks and balances. This prevents illegal activities such as bribery and ensures that customs officials cannot act improperly. Since last year, there have been no instances of customs officials accepting bribes or smuggling goods.

The Xiamen Labor Bureau has focused on improving service attitudes, conducting on-site operations in enterprises to address issues such as recruitment, worker transfers, and wage adjustments. They have also established a series of regulations to prevent gift-giving and relationships, and to limit the processing time for each department. For past cases of worker transfers, they have conducted a one-time review and resolution. The municipal government, after evaluation, deemed the leadership of this bureau to be clean.

The Xiamen Public Security Bureau's Entry and Exit Management Office publicly exposes individuals who, despite repeated warnings, continue to offer bribes. Additionally, they have established a monthly director's reception day and a weekly reception system for four and a half days. Applicants with complaints or requests can express them through these normal channels. Since this year, there have been no instances of bribery in this management office.

Starting this year, the municipal tax bureau has changed the process for tax adjustments and exemptions from being decided by a single person to being collectively decided by the tax bureau director, individual laborer association committee members, counter collection officers, and tax collection officers. Since the implementation of this system, the tax collection rate for individual industrial and commercial households has reached 99%.

    厦门执法监督部门厉行廉政
    据新华社厦门7月11日电  （记者蔡国烟）厦门海关和市劳动、公安、税务等执法监督部门从去年开始，结合实际情况，有针对性地陆续加强廉政建设。
    厦门海关在业务部门的审单、验货、放行等各个环节实行相互制约的作业程序。各单位配备了专职或兼职的监察员，内部形成了较完善的制约机制，使不法分子没有机会行贿，关员难以徇私。去年至今，海关没有发现工作人员有受贿放私行为。
    厦门市劳动局从改善服务态度入手，到企业现场办公，解决招工、工人调动、调整工资等问题。同时，定了杜绝送礼拉关系、限定各科室办事期限等一系列规章制度。对以前职工调动的积案，一次性研究处理。市政府经过考评，认为这个局的领导班子是廉洁的。
    厦门市公安局入出境管理处将申请出国人员中经多次劝说仍不改的送礼者公之于众。同时，设立每月一次的处长接待日和每周4天半来访接待制度。申请人有意见要求，都通过这个正常渠道反映。今年以来，这个管理处未出现受贿现象。
    从今年起，市税务局的调税和减免税从原来一个人说了算，改为由税务所所长、个体劳动者协会委员、柜台征收员和稽管员集体研究决定。这项制度试行以来，个体工商户税款入库率达99％。
