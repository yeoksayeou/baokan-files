Chinese art, whether ancient or modern, is extremely rich and unique. Since the founding of the People's Republic, Chinese art historians have compiled and published several new works on Chinese art history. However, due to various limitations, these works mostly focus on the achievements of ancient art and are relatively brief in scope. As for the writing of modern and contemporary art history, it often only touches on a few famous artists, and there are almost no comprehensive discussions on the development of modern and contemporary art. In this regard, the recently published eight-volume "A General History of Chinese Art" by Shandong Education Press fills this gap.

This work, edited by art historian Wang Bomin, with Huaxia, Ge Lu, and Chen Shaofeng as deputy editors, is collectively written by more than a dozen middle-aged and young art historians. They divided the work, conducted investigations, repeatedly discussed, and took several years to finalize the manuscript. I believe it has the following three main features:

First, it is grand in scale and rich in content. This "General History" not only covers the period from the primitive times to 1949 but also expands to include six categories: painting, calligraphy and seal cutting, printmaking, cartoon, sculpture, architectural art, and craft art. The entire book is divided into eight volumes, with approximately 2.5 million words and more than 2,000 illustrations. The scale is unprecedented. Moreover, it has been supplemented with a large amount of newly discovered art historical materials from the past 30 years.

Second, it combines history and theory, seeking truth from facts. One outstanding feature of this general history in its writing is its effort to avoid the mere listing of materials and the rigid application of viewpoints. It strives to combine history and theory, emphasizing seeking truth from facts and drawing conclusions from specific analyses. It is written with Marxist historical materialism and aesthetic thoughts, but it does not replace specific analyses with general principles, nor does it simplify, absolutize, or formulaize the understanding of general principles.

Third, it adheres to the direction while considering diversity. The section on modern and contemporary art history is in the seventh volume of this book. Its content and scope are unprecedented, but what is more worth mentioning is the viewpoint and method of its writing.

For example, in the history of modern art, there has always been a dispute over what constitutes new art. This book believes that the innovation proposed by the May Fourth Movement mainly started from learning from the West. It was through learning from Western art that Chinese art underwent significant changes. However, this is not yet the true new art. The so-called new art should have a broad content, but it mainly refers to art that can serve the revolutionary struggle during the revolutionary war period and serve socialism after the revolutionary victory, that is, art that serves the people. While we focus on developing art that expresses socialist content, we should not forget to develop the "hundred flowers" of socialism. The general history's discussion on the modern art section affirms the development direction and mainstream of new art, but also, from the perspective of artistic freedom exploration and the demand for diversity, gives a certain position to other arts. This is still appropriate.

    纵横今古　独具异彩
    ——简评《中国美术通史》
    戴舟
    我国美术，无论古代的和现代的，都极丰富而独具异彩。建国以来，我国美术史家先后编撰和出版过一些新的中国美术史著述，但由于各种条件所限，这些著作大多限于古代美术成就的介绍，而且篇幅比较简短；至于近现代美术史的撰写，也往往只涉及极少数名家，完整论述近现代美术发展的几乎没有。在这方面，山东教育出版社最近出版的八卷本大型《中国美术通史》正好弥补了这一不足。
    这部由美术史家王伯敏任主编，华夏、葛路、陈少丰任副主编的著作，是由十几位中青年美术史家集体撰写的。他们分工负责，调查研究，反复讨论，经过几年的时间才定稿。我认为它主要有以下三个特点：
    一、规模宏大、内容丰富。这部“通史”，不仅从原始时期一直写到1949年，而且在范围上，扩充为绘画、书法篆刻、版画、漫画、雕塑、建筑艺术和工艺美术六个门类。全书分为八卷，约250余万字，附图2000余幅。规模之大，为前所未有。而且还得到了30余年来新发掘美术史料的大量补充。
    二、史论结合，实事求是。这部通史编写上的一个突出优点，就是力求避免资料的罗列与观点的硬套，而且竭力探求史论结合；强调实事求是、从具体分析中得出结论。以马克思主义唯物史观和美学思想进行编写，但又不把一般原理代替具体分析，不把一般原理作简单化、绝对化与公式化的理解。
    三、坚持方向，兼顾多样。近现代美术史部分，属于该书的第七卷。它的内容和篇幅固然是过去所没有的，但是更值得一提的，还在编写的观点与方法。
    比如，在近现代美术史上，究竟什么是新美术？过去一直存在着分歧。该书认为：“五四”运动所提出的革新，主要是从学习西方入手，通过学习西方美术，才使我国美术发生了显著的变化。其实，这还不是真正的新美术。所谓新美术，内容应该是广泛的，但主要指革命战争时期能为革命斗争服务，和革命胜利以后能为社会主义服务，亦即为人民服务的美术。我们着重发展表现社会主义内容的艺术的同时，也不能忘记发展社会主义的“百花”。通史对近现代美术部分的论述，既肯定新美术的发展方向和主流，又从艺术的自由探索和多样化要求出发给其它美术以一定的地位，这还是恰当的。
