The People's Daily, Caracas, July 7th — Reporter Zhu Manting reports: Colombia's president announced yesterday a series of economic austerity measures, including reducing military and administrative expenditures and cutting investments in oil and telecommunications, to cope with the coffee market crisis.

Coffee is one of Colombia's economic pillars. Last year, coffee foreign exchange earnings reached $1.52 billion, accounting for 30% of its export revenue. However, due to the recent failure of coffee exporting countries to reach an agreement on export quotas, a price war has erupted internationally, leading to a continuous decline in coffee prices. It is estimated that Colombia will lose $250 million in income this year as a result. However, the Colombian finance minister stated that Colombia's exports have already been diversified, and there is no need to take emergency measures.

    国际咖啡市场价格下跌  哥伦比亚宣布经济紧缩
    本报加拉加斯7月7日电  记者朱满庭报道：哥伦比亚总统昨天宣布一项经济紧缩措施，减少军费和行政开支，压缩在石油和电讯等方面的投资，以对付咖啡市场危机。
    咖啡是哥伦比亚的经济支柱之一，去年咖啡外汇收入达15.2亿美元，占其出口收入额的30％。但由于前不久咖啡出口国未能就各国出口份额达成协议，国际上出现了咖啡价格战、咖啡价格不断下降。估计今年哥伦比亚要因此少收入2.5亿美元。但哥伦比亚财长表示，哥伦比亚出口已实现多样化，无需采取紧急措施。
