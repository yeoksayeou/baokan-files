Professor Liu Qixian's "The Source and Transmission of the Book of Documents" has been published by Liaoning University Press. This monograph, from Chapter 1 "The Earliest Book of Documents" to Chapter 8 "Modern Compilation and Research on the Book of Documents," introduces the history of the Book of Documents itself and the transmission and research of the Book of Documents throughout history. Chapter 9, "Various Editions of the Book of Documents," is a revised version of three articles previously published in the "History of Historiography" magazine, providing a detailed introduction to various editions of the Book of Documents since the Han stone inscriptions.

Professor Liu has long been engaged in the study of the Book of Documents under the guidance of Mr. Gu Jiegang. After Mr. Gu's passing, he has been working on the monumental work "Annotation, Translation, and Commentary on the Book of Documents," initiated by Mr. Gu, to complete his teacher's unfinished work. In addition, he has written a comprehensive "History of the Study of the Book of Documents" based on his extensive research on the Book of Documents over the years, which will soon be published by Zhonghua Book Company. It is fitting that he is the author of the book we are introducing today.

The Book of Documents has editions in modern script, ancient script, and forged ancient script, with a complex process of compilation and transmission. Due to its exalted status in ancient times, numerous works on the Book of Documents have been written throughout history, making it difficult to navigate. The author, in a relatively concise volume, has managed to present the history of the Book of Documents itself, as well as the transmission and research of the Book of Documents throughout history and their characteristics in a comprehensive and clear manner. In dealing with materials, the author has selected the best and most extensive, and in discussing issues, he has been both profound and accessible, fully demonstrating his deep expertise in the study of the Book of Documents. The author also emphasizes placing the history of the Book of Documents and the history of its research within the broader context of the development of Chinese scholarship. This is another notable strength of the book. Therefore, after reading this book, one not only gains a good understanding of the characteristics of the study of the Book of Documents in various eras but also significantly deepens one's understanding of the history of Chinese scholarship. For example, after reading Chapter 5, "The Song Dynasty's Use of the Forged Ancient Book of Documents to Propose New Interpretations, Establish Neo-Confucianism, and Engage in Doubt and Debate," readers will undoubtedly feel that they have a more comprehensive and profound understanding of the history of Song Dynasty scholarship. Other chapters have similar effects.

Chapter 9 provides a wealth of information on the various editions of the Book of Documents. Much of the content, such as the comprehensive introduction to various stone inscriptions and cursive script editions of the Book of Documents, is extremely useful for researchers. General readers can also learn a great deal from this chapter. For example, the first section's introduction to stone inscriptions throughout history is both comprehensive and clear, and the second section's explanation of the term "cursive script" is extremely precise (see pages 215-216). If one were to consult other related books, one might need to read many different books and spend a lot of time to gain this knowledge.

There are some problems in the study of the Book of Documents that are currently difficult to resolve completely. When dealing with these problems, the author is sometimes very cautious. For example, regarding the authorship of the forged Ancient Book of Documents, after pointing out the flaws in the various existing theories, the author suggests that "we should not insist on knowing what we do not know and forcefully attribute it to a specific individual. Since there is no conclusive evidence to determine its authorship, it is sufficient to know that the forged ancient script is a product of the historical conditions of the Jin Dynasty; there is no need to find the specific individual who forged it" (page 102). This is a very objective attitude. However, the author's handling of some issues seems to leave room for discussion. For example, what was the nature of the Ancient Book of Documents transmitted from the Eastern Han to the Wei and Jin dynasties before the appearance of the forged ancient script? What is its relationship with the Kong Anguo edition of the Western Han? This is also a very difficult problem to solve. The author believes that this edition was written by Du Lin based on the "lacquered Ancient Book of Documents" he obtained, "rewriting the various chapters of the Book of Documents that could be seen at the time, namely the modern script twenty-nine chapters," and is an ancient script edition rewritten in ancient characters, unrelated to the Kong Anguo edition of the Western Han (pages 38-39). This explanation is not without reason. However, presenting this explanation as a definitive statement to readers may not be entirely appropriate (see Ma Yong, "A History of the Book of Documents," page 29). Similarly, the formation of the current "Book of Documents Sequence" is also a matter of much debate. The author presents the theory that the "Book of Documents Sequence" originated from Zhang Bo's "One Hundred and Two Chapters" as a definitive statement to readers (page 32), which may also not be entirely appropriate. However, these issues do not detract from the overall value of the book.

    介绍一本重要的《尚书》学著作
    裘锡圭
    刘起釪教授所著的《尚书源流及传本考》已由辽宁大学出版社出版。这部专著从第一章“最早的《尚书》”到第八章“现代的《尚书》整理与研究”，介绍了《尚书》本身的历史和历代传习、研究《尚书》的情况。第九章“《尚书》的各种传本”，是修订曾经发表在《史学史研究》杂志上的三篇文章而成的，对从汉石经以来的《尚书》的各种传本作了详尽的介绍。
    刘先生曾长期从顾颉刚先生治《尚书》。顾先生去世后，他一直在撰写由顾先生发凡起例的巨著《尚书校释译论》，为完成老师的未竟之业而努力。此外，他还依据多年来积累的关于《尚书》的丰富资料，撰写了一部详尽的《尚书学史》，最近，将由中华书局出版。由他来写我们现在所介绍的这本书，是再合适没有了。
    《尚书》有今文本、古文本和伪古文本，成书和流传过程极为复杂。由于《尚书》在古代的崇高地位，历代关于《尚书》的著述汗牛充栋，令人眼花缭乱。作者在不多的篇幅里，就把《尚书》本身的历史以及历代传习、研究《尚书》的情况和时代特点介绍得既全面又清晰；在对待资料方面做到了取精用弘，在论述问题方面做到了深入浅出，充分体现了他在《尚书》学方面的深厚功力。作者还着力于把《尚书》的历史和《尚书》的研究史放在古今学术发展史的大背景下来加以论述。这也是一个很突出的优点。因此，读了本书以后，不但能很好地掌握住各个时代的《尚书》学的特色，而且还能大大加深对我国学术发展史的认识。举个例子来说，相信大多数读者在读完了第五章“宋代承用伪《古文尚书》提出新解建立‘理学’与展开疑辨”以后，一定会感到对宋代学术史有了比过去更为全面和深刻的认识。其他各章都能起类似的作用。
    第九章提供了关于《尚书》传本的丰富资料。其中的很多内容，如对《尚书》的各种石经本和隶古定写本的全面介绍，对于研究者极为有用。一般读者从这一章也能学到不少东西。例如第一节对历代石经的介绍既全面又清晰，第二节对“隶古定”一词的解释极为精确（见215—216页），如果去看别的有关的书，恐怕要看很多种书，花很多时间，才能获得这些知识。
    《尚书》研究存在着一些目前尚难彻底解决的问题。作者处理这些问题的时候，有时是很慎重的。例如关于伪《古文尚书》的作者问题，作者在指出现有各种说法都有漏洞之后，认为我们最好“不要强不知以为知去勉强定一人。既然无确证可以论定它，那就只要知道伪古文是晋代历史条件下的产物就行了，没有必要非找出这位作伪的某个人来不可”（102页）。这是很客观的态度。但是对有的问题，作者的处理方法似乎尚有商榷余地。例如，伪古文出现之前、东汉至魏晋传习的《古文尚书》，究竟是什么样的本子？它跟西汉的孔安国本究竟是什么关系？这也是很难解决的问题。作者认为这个本子是杜林根据他所得的“漆书《古文尚书》一卷”，“改写当时所能见到的《尚书》即今文二十九篇的各篇”而成的，“是按照古文字体将今文加以改写的古文本”，跟西汉时的孔安国本无关（38—39页）。这样说并非没有道理。但是把这一说法作为定说介绍给读者，恐怕就不一定妥当了（参看马雍《尚书史话》29页）。又如，今本《书序》究竟是如何形成的，也是一个众说纷纭的问题。作者把《书序》出于张霸“百两篇”之说作为定说介绍给读者（32页），恐怕也不一定妥当。不过这些都无伤于此书的大体。
