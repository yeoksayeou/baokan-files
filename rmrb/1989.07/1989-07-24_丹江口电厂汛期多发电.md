The Danjiangkou Hydropower Plant, which plays a crucial role in stabilizing the safe operation of the Central China power grid, has overcome numerous challenges to achieve full capacity generation and supply during the flood season. From June 1 to July 20, the plant generated 450 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, setting a new record for the same period in the plant's 21-year history.

In mid-July, a significant flood peak occurred upstream of the Han River. The workers remained at their posts, ensuring the continuous operation of the generating units.
