Soviet leader Gorbachev concluded his visit to France on July 6. It is believed that although Gorbachev stayed in Paris for only two days, he reaped significant gains. He and President Mitterrand signed a long-term cooperation declaration, and the two sides also signed 22 agreements on bilateral cooperation (including economics, technology, culture, etc.). This marks the beginning of a surge in Franco-Soviet cooperation and reflects the trend of rapprochement and cooperation between East and West Europe, which have long been divided and opposed.

In recent years, both France and the Soviet Union have made significant efforts to promote exchanges and cooperation in Europe. Whether it is France's Eastern policy or the Soviet Union's proposal to jointly build a "European House," they both believe that countries belonging to different groups and nations with different levels of economic and social development should eliminate their differences and embark on a path of mutual dialogue and cooperation. The leaders of both countries say they can best represent the two parts of Europe and are willing to play their respective roles, which has already attracted attention within and outside Europe.

During Gorbachev's visit to France, the following points raised in the talks are considered worthy of attention.

Reflections on the post-war situation. Gorbachev said in a response, "The post-war period has passed," and Paris newspapers prominently published this view. This is different from Mitterrand's statement that the "Yalta era has ended," but the meaning is similar. What changes will Europe bring about by bidding farewell to the "post-war period"? It is difficult for people to guess, but it is generally believed that it may be conducive to Europe's independence and the unity and cooperation of Eastern and Western Europe.

Persistent efforts in arms reduction are a reliable guarantee for European security. One of the starting points of the "European House" proposal is that the military forces of existing military alliances, even individual countries, must be reduced to a low level of defense needs. The French side emphasizes opposition to "overarmament" and advocates achieving a balance of power through arms reduction. Arms reduction was an important topic in the talks between the French and Soviet leaders. What kind of defense does Europe need? This still requires serious consideration and study by the European countries.

Exchange and cooperation without a material foundation are not reliable. Europe needs to extensively develop economic, trade, and technological cooperation. Both the French and Soviet sides expressed dissatisfaction with the results they have achieved so far. Gorbachev criticized certain discriminatory and artificially created obstacles. He suggested creating new forms, such as encouraging investment, joint ventures, and joint factories, to develop economic cooperation between France and the Soviet Union and between East and West Europe. The French side, while working towards a unified market, holds a positive attitude towards cooperation between the CMEA member countries and the EEC.

Local public opinion has noted that through this visit, France and the Soviet Union have come closer, but differences and contradictions still exist, especially on the issue of nuclear disarmament. From a broader perspective, the exchanges between East and West Europe also face certain difficulties. It should be soberly recognized that the two major military blocs in East and West Europe are still in serious confrontation, and the U.S. military presence in Europe will be long-term. On issues involving security, sovereignty, and freedom and human rights, the positions and understandings of various parties are often inconsistent. Therefore, the blueprint for European cooperation needs to be truly implemented, and there is still a huge and arduous task ahead, which requires the joint efforts of all Europeans.

    戈尔巴乔夫的法国之行
    本报记者　张启华
    苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫已于7月6日结束了对法国的访问。人们认为，戈尔巴乔夫在巴黎虽仅停留两天，但收获不小。他和密特朗总统在一项长期的合作声明上签了字，双方还签署了有关双边合作的协议（包括经济、科技、文化等）共22项。这标志着法苏合作进入热潮，也反映了长期处于分裂对抗的东西欧转向接近与合作的趋势。
    近年来，法苏两国都为推动欧洲的交流与合作做了重大的努力。无论是法国的东方政策，还是苏联的共建“欧洲大厦”的主张，都认为分属不同集团的国家、经济社会发展水平不等的民族，彼此应消除分歧，走上相互对话、合作的道路。法苏领导都说他们最能代表欧洲的两个部分，表示愿意发挥各自的作用，这一点已引起欧洲内外的关注。
    戈尔巴乔夫访法期间，人们认为会谈中提出的以下观点是值得重视的。
    对战后局势的反思。戈尔巴乔夫在一次答辞中说，“战后时期过去了”，巴黎报刊以显著地位刊登了这一观点。这同密特朗所说的“雅尔塔时代结束”，说法不同，含义相当。欧洲告别“战后时期”，可能带来什么样的变化，人们尚难猜测，但一般认为它可能会有利于欧洲的独立、东西两部分欧洲的联合和合作。
    坚持不懈地裁军是欧洲安全的可靠保证。“欧洲大厦”建议的出发点之一是，现存军事集团，甚至国家的军备必须降到防务所需的低水平。法国方面强调反对“超军备”，主张通过裁军实现力量均衡。裁军是这次法苏领导人会谈的一个重要议题，欧洲究竟需要什么样的防务，这还需要欧洲各国认真思考和研究。
    没有物质基础的交流与合作是不牢靠的。欧洲需要广泛开展经济、贸易、科技合作，法苏双方都对它们之间已取得的成果表示不满足。戈尔巴乔夫批评某些歧视性、人为设置障碍的作法。他建议创建新的，诸如鼓励投资、合资经营、联合办厂等形式开展法苏和东西欧之间经济合作。法国方面在致力于统一大市场的同时，对经互会成员国与欧共体的合作持积极态度。
    此间舆论注意到，法苏通过这次访问已有更多的接近，但分歧和矛盾依然存在，特别是在核裁军问题上，从更广方面看，东西欧的交流也遇到某些困难。应该清醒地看到，东西欧两大军事集团依然严重对峙，美国在欧洲的军事存在将是长期的。在涉及安全、主权以及自由、人权等问题上，各方的立场、认识经常是不一致的。因此欧洲合作蓝图要真正付诸实现，还有艰苦浩大的工程，还有待全体欧洲人共同努力。
