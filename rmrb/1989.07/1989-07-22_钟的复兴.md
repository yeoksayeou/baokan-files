	The Revival of the Clock
		Wáng Yíhóng

	“Britain, an ocean of clocks!” A friend who had visited Britain remarked as such.

	The comment, though exaggerated, highlights a significant characteristic of Great Britain, this Western island nation. He said, when you step onto British soil, especially when driving through the city, clocks of all sizes will greet your eyes: church spires adorned with clocks, municipal buildings embedded with clocks, clocks in front of train stations, and even clocks on factory gates! These clocks are mostly grand and magnificent, with rich and varied clock faces, each with a distinct style.

	In Britain, the bronze clocks on old buildings are mostly products of the Victorian and Edwardian eras. At that time, clocks served primarily a practical function. Ordinary people did not have mechanical or electronic watches as they do today. People had to rely on the large clocks on buildings when taking trains, attending church services, or going to work. Of course, large clocks were also symbols of the owner's prosperity. As time passed, especially with the development of architecture, modern architects began to dislike the idea of embedding large clocks on buildings, with some even scoffing at it, leading to a temporary cooling of the clock-building craze in Britain. History has a surprising repetitiveness. In recent years, influenced by the postmodern architectural movement, Britain has seen a resurgence in the clock-building craze. However, this time the trend reflects a modern atmosphere: clocks are mostly built in and around supermarkets and tourist centers, rather than primarily on churches and palaces as in the past.

	Why spend money and effort building clocks? The sales manager of the Smith Company in Derby, Richard Blake, said:

	“Because architects have realized that designing a clock on a building can enhance people's aesthetic awareness and add a certain liveliness to the building.” Perhaps the manager forgot to add: “Of course, it is also for the convenience of everyone checking the time.”

	The clock-building craze has also brought business opportunities to clock companies. Mr. Braikeworth of the Smith Clock Company joyfully said:

	“Orders are pouring in! This year, we will produce and install 350 clocks for our customers. The price for producing and installing a single-faced clock ranges from 1,600 pounds to 30,000 pounds.”

	Modern clocks, compared to ancient clocks like the Big Ben in the British Parliament, naturally differ in materials and design. Ancient clocks are mostly bronze, appearing solemn and luxurious; modern clocks are mostly made of microcircuits, appearing light and simple.

	In addition to building new clocks, the British, who value traditional culture, naturally will not forget to protect ancient clocks. Mr. Braikeworth said that his company is responsible for maintaining over 4,000 large clocks in Britain, most of which are ancient. The company has installed electric winding mechanisms for the giant clocks in the famous Westminster Abbey and Windsor Castle.

    钟的复兴
    王怡红
      “英伦三岛，钟的海洋！”一位朋友访英归来如是说。
    评语虽有夸张之嫌，但却道出了大不列颠这个西洋岛国的一大特征。他说，当你一踏上英国的土地，尤其是驱车在城中一游的时候，一座座巨钟就会扑入你的眼帘：教堂的尖塔上镶着钟，市政大厅的建筑物上嵌着钟，火车站前也有钟，工厂大门上还是钟！这些钟大都庞大宏伟，钟面丰富多彩，风格迥然有异。
    在英国，老建筑物上的铜钟多是维多利亚和爱德华时代的产物。那时，钟发挥的主要是实用功能。因为普通人还没有今天的机械手表或电子表。人们搭乘车船、上教堂作礼拜以及上班时必须眺望建筑物上的大钟。当然，大钟亦是显示主人事业兴旺的象征。后来，随着时间的推移，尤其是建筑艺术的发展，现代派建筑师对在建筑物上镶嵌大钟深感不悦，有的甚至对此嗤之以鼻，致使英国的建钟热一度冷却。历史有着惊人的重复性。近年来，由于后现代主义建筑学派的影响，英国再度兴起了建钟热。不过此次热潮折射出了现代气息：大钟多建在超级市场内外和旅游中心，而不是像过去那样主要建在教堂和皇宫上。
    为什么要费钱费力建钟呢？英国德尔比市的史密斯公司销售经理里查德·布赖克说：
  “因为建筑师认识到，在建筑物上设计一座钟，既能提高人的审美意识，又能给建筑物增添一定的活力。”也许这位经理先生还忘了说这么一句话：“当然也是为了方便大家看时间。”
    建钟热也给钟表公司带来了赚钱的机会。史密斯钟表公司的布赖克沃尔先生欣喜地说：
  “现在来本公司订货的不少哇！今年我们要给订户生产三百五十座钟并负责安装。我们生产和安装一座单面钟的价格是一千六百英镑到三万英镑不等。”
    现代钟与英国议院塔上的大钟等古钟相比，在材料、造型上自然有所不同。古钟多为铜钟，看上去庄严而华贵；今钟则多微型电路作成的电子钟，显得轻灵简洁。
    除了建造新钟之外，注重传统文化的英国人自然不会忘记保护古钟。布赖克沃尔先生说，他的公司负责维修英国的四千多座大钟，其中多数是古钟。该公司已为英国名人国葬场所威斯敏斯特教堂和著名的温莎城堡内的巨钟安装了电动发条。
