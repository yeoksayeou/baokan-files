A notable feature of this year's "Anti-American Joint Struggle Month" in Korea (June 25 - July 27) is the strong demand for the United States to stop interfering in Korean internal affairs, withdraw its troops from South Korea, and allow the Korean people to achieve national self-determination and peaceful reunification through dialogue and consultation.

The Korean Armistice Agreement has been signed for 36 years. However, North and South Korea are still in a state of sharp military confrontation and division. The fundamental cause of this tragedy is that the United States has rudely interfered in Korean internal affairs and pursued a policy of hostility and division towards Korea. Politically, the United States has pursued a "two Koreas" policy. Militarily, the United States not only refuses to withdraw its troops from South Korea but also continuously upgrades the weapons and equipment of its troops stationed there. Since 1976, the United States and South Korea have held annual "Team Spirit" joint military exercises, further escalating tensions on the peninsula and undermining the atmosphere for North-South dialogue.

Excluding foreign interference and achieving self-determination and peaceful reunification of the motherland is the highest national aspiration of all Korean people. The Workers' Party of Korea and the government have made unremitting efforts for this cause and have proposed a series of reasonable plans. Chairman Kim Il-sung's proposal to establish the Democratic Confederation of Koryo has pointed out the correct direction and path for Korea's peaceful reunification. During this year's Anti-American Joint Struggle Month, various political parties and organizations in Korea issued a joint appeal, and hundreds of thousands of people in major cities across the country took to the streets to demand that the United States stop interfering in Korean internal affairs and withdraw its troops from South Korea. The voices of the South Korean people demanding to shake off American interference are also growing louder, with anti-American rallies and demonstrations taking place across the country.

The struggle of North and South Korea to exclude foreign interference and strive for self-determination and peaceful reunification of the motherland has won widespread support and solidarity from the international community. World opinion points out that the United States' refusal to withdraw its troops from South Korea is contrary to the trend of the times. Young people from various countries participating in the 13th World Youth Festival firmly support the just struggle of the Korean people. They believe that easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace in Korea will help Asia and the world move from tension to relaxation.

Without foreign interference, it is the correct path that suits the will of heaven and the people for all Korean people to solve the problem of peaceful reunification on their own. People firmly believe that through the unyielding struggle of all Korean people, the beautiful land of three thousand li will end its history of division, and the 70 million people's long-cherished wish for national reunification and ethnic unity will definitely be realized.

    排除外来干涉的强烈呼声
    本报记者  徐宝康
    今年朝鲜“反美共同斗争月”（6.25—7.27）的一个显著特点是，强烈要求美国停止干涉朝鲜内政，从南朝鲜撤军，让朝鲜人民自己通过对话和协商，实现祖国自主、和平的统一大业。
    朝鲜停战协定签字整整36年了。但是朝鲜北南仍处在尖锐的军事对峙和分裂状态。造成这种悲剧的根本原因是，美国粗暴干涉朝鲜内政，推行敌视、分裂朝鲜的政策。在政治上，美国推行“两个朝鲜”的政策，在军事上，美国不仅拒不从南朝鲜撤军，而且还不断使驻南朝鲜美军的武器装备换代升级。自1976年开始，美国和南朝鲜每年举行“协作精神”联合军事演习，从而不断加剧半岛的紧张局势，破坏了北南对话气氛。
    排除外来干涉、自主和平统一祖国是全体朝鲜人民的最高民族愿望。朝鲜劳动党和政府为此进行了坚持不懈的努力，提出了一系列合理方案。金日成主席提出的建立高丽民主联邦共和国的方案，为朝鲜的和平统一指明了正确的方向和途径。在今年反美共同斗争月里，朝鲜各政党团体发表联合呼吁书，全国各大城市数十万群众上街游行，一致要求美国停止干涉朝鲜内政，撤走驻南朝鲜美军。南朝鲜人民要求摆脱美国干涉的呼声也不断高涨，反美集会和示威遍及各地。
    朝鲜北南要求排除外来干涉、争取自主和平统一祖国的斗争，赢得了国际社会的广泛支持和声援。世界舆论指出，美国拒不从南朝鲜撤军是与时代的潮流相违背的。参加第13届世界青年联欢节的各国青年，坚决支持朝鲜人民的正义斗争。他们认为，缓和朝鲜半岛紧张局势，保障朝鲜和平，将有助于亚洲及世界形势从紧张走向缓和。
    在没有外来干涉的情况下，由全体朝鲜人民自己解决和平统一问题，是应乎天理、顺乎民心的正确道路。人们坚信，经过全体朝鲜人民不屈不挠的斗争，三千里美好江山必将结束分裂的历史，7000万人民希望祖国统一和民族团聚的宿愿一定会实现。　（本报平壤7月27日电）
