Marxist theoretical education is indispensable. It should not be subjected to unwarranted criticism. During the days when bourgeois liberalization was rampant, there were indeed many confusing and worrying things happening in our country. As for Marxist theoretical education, it was criticized both in society and in institutions of higher learning. This compulsory course, which nurtures students, trains cadres, and raises the masses, was seen by some as an unwanted burden, a "troublesome affair" that is "unavoidable but ineffective." The teachers of this course were often viewed as embodiments of dogmatism and rigidity, as "Marxist-Leninist pedants who have adverse effects." Why did such strange phenomena occur in a socialist republic that takes Marxism as its guiding ideology? Is it because the course itself is flawed? No, although it still needs further reform and improvement. Is it because the teachers are incompetent? No, although they still need to expand their knowledge and improve their teaching skills. The main problem lies in the interference and slander by those who promote bourgeois liberalization, as well as the indulgence and support of a few individuals who once held high positions within the Party. These two groups, in different settings, with different identities, and using different methods and means, directly or indirectly denigrate and negate Marxism, especially its vitality in contemporary times and its guiding role in China's socialist system reform and socialist modernization construction. This is not a fundamental destruction of Marxist theoretical education? Now, after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, we need to reflect deeply and analyze those erroneous views that once prevailed, which negated Marxism and thus also negated Marxist theoretical education. We need to eliminate the confusion caused by these erroneous views while seriously studying how to strengthen and reform Marxist theoretical education. Through reflection and exchange of views, we can reach a consensus and make joint efforts to elevate Marxist theoretical education to its rightful level.

The "Obsolescence of Marxism" Theory is Extremely Absurd

Those who promote bourgeois liberalization are ardent propagandists of the "obsolescence of Marxism" theory. They instill in the youth, especially students, the idea that the works of Marx and Engels were written in the last century. Even if they are truths, they are no longer applicable to the development of the world in the 1980s, and they cannot solve many of the problems facing China today. This argument has considerable seductive and deceptive power (this can be clearly seen from the various slogans, declarations, and platforms that emerged from the student movement, which denigrate Marxism and Marxist theoretical education). To expose the essence of this argument, it is necessary to emphasize the following two levels of issues:

Firstly, as a crystallization of human cultural essence, Marxism, with its high scientific, revolutionary, and creative nature, deeply rooted in practice, constantly drawing strength from the practice of millions of people creating material and spiritual civilization, destroying the old world and building a new one, to enrich, update, develop, and perfect itself. It has a very special relationship with the era that gave birth to it and that it represents. It is known that when free capitalism approached its heyday, various social contradictions were more fully exposed, and various class forces were more thoroughly revealed; when the ideological system of free capitalism became increasingly conservative, vulgar, and decadent, and could not indicate the direction of further development of capitalism that would lead humanity, the era put forward such a demand, that is, the demand to create a more progressive, more scientific, and more thorough ideological system that could most effectively serve the cause of human liberation. At the same time, the era also provided the material and spiritual conditions to meet this demand. Marxism, born in response to the era's demand, is the child of satisfying the era's demand and the guide to solving the era's new questions. It is both born of the era and above the era. In general, it is theoretically ahead of its time, pointing the direction of the era's development, and thus above the era. In specific terms, it cannot but be limited by specific historical conditions in this or that specific stage and environment. It must, and can only, step by step overcome these historical limitations by constantly drawing on new experiences provided by practice and new achievements provided by scientific development, to maintain its scientific youth and strengthen its leading position in the torrent of the era. Yes, Marxism was conceived and formed in the last century, this is a fact. However, the truth of Marxism has not stopped in the last century; it has advanced with the turn of the centuries and the changes and development of the era, this is also a fact. From Marxism to Marxism-Leninism and then to the development of Marxism-Leninism today, is this not a powerful historical testimony? Marxism has not only not become obsolete but continues to play a great role in recognizing and transforming the world today. Not only do Marxists hold this view. Some famous scholars in the West who study and criticize Marxism also have similar views. Even Sartre said: "Marxism is far from being exhausted, it is still very young, almost in its infancy, it seems to have just begun to develop, so it is still the philosophy of our era, it is not to be discarded, because the environment that produced it has not been discarded." Sartre believes: "Everything must be thought of from the standpoint of Marxism" (Sartre: "Critique of Dialectical Reason"). R. L. Heilbronner said: "I am as deeply convinced as Sartre that Marxism is our contemporary 'necessary' philosophy, I mean by this that Marxism can greatly broaden one's vision, from a historical and social perspective, to see the crux of our lives." He believes: "To explore the prospects of human development, one must inevitably learn from Marxism." He asserts: "In our era and in the future, the change of the world is undeniable, and most of it will be carried out under the inspiration and guidance of Marxism itself." (R. L. Heilbronner: "Marxism: For and Against") There are many similar figures and similar views. It is not possible to quote them all here.

If we compare the sayings of these two famous people with the statements of those who promote bourgeois liberalization, we can clearly see that their so-called Marxism is "closed," "narrow," "exclusive," "rigid," "ugly," and the like, and their so-called "Old Horse Theory is full of ambiguous and sensational phrases from head to toe, which is to the taste of those in power.... It is a service to a few privileged classes, an anesthetic, and a shackle that enslaves us," as well as the cries to "drive Marxist theory out of the stage of Chinese theoretical thought" and the so-called "setting up a Marxist theory course is contrary to the laws of human thought development," are all substandard goods. Lu Xun said: "Insults and threats are not fighting." Those who promote bourgeois liberalization know nothing about the Marxism they oppose and hate, and cannot produce decent debate materials, of course, they can only resort to insults and threats to engage in an unseemly "fight."

Secondly, the argument that Marxism cannot adapt to the requirements of today's world development and cannot solve many of the problems facing China today is even more revealing of the ignorance of those who promote bourgeois liberalization about the essential characteristics of Marxist theory. Let me ask, when and where did Marx and Engels ever promise to provide a ready-made cure for all diseases and ready-made answers for all kinds of problems for the masses? On the contrary, they solemnly declared that they do not advocate "raising any banner of dogmatism," and their desks do not have that "stupid vulgar world only needs to open its mouth to receive the absolutely scientific roast chicken." They repeatedly pointed out: Marxism is a new worldview, this worldview is not a doctrine but a method, it provides not ready-made doctrines but starting points for further research and methods for such research. Engels said with great emphasis: "Do not mechanically apply Marx's and my words, but think for yourself like Marx, only in this sense does the word Marxist have a reason to exist." The matter is clear. We believe that Marxism is not unadaptable but completely adaptable to the requirements of today's world development, not unable to solve but able to effectively guide the solution of all problems facing China today, this is entirely about the scientific power of recognition and transformation of the Marxist worldview and methodology, and has nothing to do with any ready-made remedies and ready-made answers. Whoever turns Marx and Engels from revolutionary leaders and scientific giants into fortune-tellers, demanding that they foresee the future, and turns Marxism from a scientific worldview and methodology into a revelation of the prophets and a strategy library for solving worldly troubles, and then uses this to completely negate Marxism, such intentions and methods are very unworthy.

Those who promote bourgeois liberalization often use the tactic of one trick not working and then another. When they see that the goal of completely negating Marxism is difficult to achieve, they immediately come up with another "high theory," saying that "in the range of a hundred schools of thought, Marxism can at most be one school, without a guiding position above all"; saying that "the position of Marxism in some authoritarian countries is obtained and maintained by the gun barrel and the state power"; saying that we must oppose the "Chinese-style thinking model of 'only Marxism is correct'." This is another seemingly reasonable but actually misleading statement. Yes, Marxism in the late 1940s and early 1950s of the last century was indeed a young school of thought among the many schools of thought in the garden of human thought. But it has been constantly rising in the selection of history. In the 1960s and 1970s of the last century, it rose to become the guiding ideology of the world's workers' movement, and after the victory of the October Socialist Revolution in this century and the development of the socialist revolution from one country to many countries, it became the guiding ideology of socialist countries and the most influential theoretical system that spread throughout the globe and shook the world. To close one's eyes and not acknowledge this fact, muttering about Marxism being "only" and "just" a school of thought, is it not as ridiculous as an ostrich burying its head in the sand? It should be emphasized that the change and rise in the position of this school of Marxism is not due to the so-called "Marxists paving the way for their theory with gun barrels" and "maintaining the supreme position of their theory with the state machine," but because it is itself a theoretical system that highly unites strict scientific nature and thorough revolutionary nature based on practice. It is the only theoretical system in the history of human thought that possesses such advantages and characteristics. It completely relies on the power of its own truth to open the door to people's hearts and the road to victory. Higher education should be an important battlefield for Marxist education.

Since history has affirmed the position of Marxism as the guiding ideology in our socialist republic, it is also in accordance with the requirements of history to elevate Marxist theoretical education to its rightful level. This is not about arguing over the high and low positions of schools of thought. For our cause of socialism and communism, it is a need to lay the foundation for cultivating young Marxists, for cultivating talents for socialist modernization, and for cultivating successors to the communist cause.

We know that elevating Marxist theoretical education to its rightful level is not something that can be achieved simply by making a decision or issuing a notice. This requires the attention, support, and care of the entire Party and the people, the coordination and efforts of the central and state leadership organs in charge of ideology and Marxist theoretical education workers, and the education authorities and the vast number of teachers to calmly consider the past, present, and future of Marxist theoretical education issues, and seriously summarize experiences and lessons. It goes without saying that Marxist theoretical education needs to be strengthened, but to truly and effectively strengthen and improve it, it is necessary to carry out major reforms in this field, such as teacher training, curriculum construction, and teaching method improvement. In the reform, we should pay attention to some effective experiences accumulated in the 1950s and 1960s, of course, not to mechanically bring them back, but to combine them with the new situations, new topics, and new experiences of the 1980s to carry them forward. For example: the past emphasis on Marxist theoretical education, respect for Marxist theoretical workers, and viewing them as an important army of the Party on the ideological front, both strictly demanding and giving them multi-faceted care in politics and business, should be restored, enriched, and improved. The past teaching orientation of teaching and educating people should be fully affirmed and elevated to a new level in combination with today's specific realities; as for the tendency to turn Marxist theoretical education courses into a simple summary of original works, a simple introduction to various schools of thought, and the transmission of general knowledge, it is an undesirable tendency that should be corrected. The past good experience of fully playing the leading role of the teaching and research office in organizing teaching should be better utilized. The teaching and research office should strive to organize the discussion of topics on the basis of mobilizing the initiative and enthusiasm of teachers and conducting correct teaching guidance. The tendency of "teachers going to the podium, the more sensational the better" should not be allowed to continue. The past practice of grasping classroom discussions as an important link in teaching should be better implemented, so that students can exchange views and improve their understanding in lively and lively discussions.

    马克思主义理论教育不可忽视——
    兼驳资产阶级自由化的几个错误观点
    许征帆
    不应有的非难
    在资产阶级自由化泛滥的那些日子里，神州大地上确有不少令人困惑担忧的事情。就以马克思主义理论教育而言，它无论是在社会上还是在高等院校里，都遭受到不应有的非难。这门哺育学生、培训干部、提高群众的必修课程，在某些人看来，是讨嫌的额外负担，是“不学不行，学了不灵”的麻烦事。而这门课程的教师，又往往被视为是教条、僵化的化身，是“起副作用的马列迂秀才”。在以马克思主义为指导思想的社会主义共和国中，为何出现这种咄咄怪事？是因为课程本身不行吗？不是，虽然它还有待于进一步改革与提高。是因为教师无能吗？不是，虽然他们还需要进一步扩充知识并完善教学艺术。事情主要坏在搞资产阶级自由化的人的干扰与诋毁，以及极个别的曾在党内占居高位的人对这种干扰、诋毁的纵容和支持。这两种人，在不同的场合，以不同的身份，用不同的手段和方法，直接间接地贬低、否定马克思主义，特别是否定马克思主义在当代的生命力和对今日中国社会主义体制改革和社会主义现代化建设的指导作用，这不正是从根本上破坏马克思主义理论教育吗？现在，在平息反革命暴乱之后，痛定思痛，我们有必要更深入地剖析那些曾流行一时的否定马克思主义从而也否定马克思主义理论教育的种种言论；有必要在消除这类错误言论造成的混乱的同时，认真研究加强和改革马克思主义理论教育的一系列新课题。通过反思和交流看法，取得共识并进行共同的努力，把马克思主义理论教育提到应有的高度。
    马克思主义“过时论”极其荒谬
    搞资产阶级自由化的极少数人，是马克思主义“过时论”的热心散布者。他们向青年、特别是向学生灌输这样的观点：马克思、恩格斯的著作都是写于上一个世纪的，就算它是真理，也已适应不了当今二十世纪八十年代世界发展的要求，解决不了今日中国面临的不少问题。这种说法颇有蛊惑力和欺骗性（从学潮中出笼的诸种口号、宣言、纲领对马克思主义和马克思主义理论教育的贬斥中，可以明显看到这一点）。为揭示其要害所在，有必要着重讲明以下两个层次的问题：
    其一，作为人类文化精华的结晶，具有高度的科学性、革命性、创造性的马克思主义，作为深深植根于实践，不断地从千百万群众创造物质文明和精神文明、破坏旧世界和创建新世界的实践中汲取力量以充实、更新、发展、完善自己的马克思主义，它与孕育了自己又是自己所代表的时代有着一种很特殊的关系。众所周知，当自由资本主义接近其鼎盛阶段，各种社会矛盾暴露较为充分，各种阶级力量显示较为彻底的时候；当自由资本主义的思想体系日趋保守、庸俗、没落，未能指明资本主义的进一步发展将把人类引向何方的时候，时代提出了这样的需求，即创建比资本主义思想体系更进步、更科学、更彻底的、能最有成效地服务于人类解放事业的思想体系的需求。同时，时代也提供了满足这种需求的物质条件和精神条件。应运而生的马克思主义是满足时代这种需求的产儿，又是解决时代新课题的指南。它源于时代又高于时代。从总体上讲，它理论超前，指明了时代发展的方向，因而高于时代。从具体上讲，它在这样那样的具体阶段里和具体环境中，又不能不这样那样地受具体历史条件的局限。它只有、也必须在永不止息地汲取实践提供的新经验中，永不倦怠地汲取科学发展提供的新成果中，一步一步地克服这种历史局限，以永葆自己的科学青春，并维护和加强自己在时代洪流中的领先地位。是的，马克思主义是孕育于、形成于上一个世纪，这是事实。但是，马克思主义的真理步伐并没有停留在上一个世纪，它随着世纪的转折、更替和时代的变动、发展而阔步行进，这同样是事实。从马克思主义到马克思列宁主义再到马克思列宁主义的现今发展，不正是历史有力的明证吗？马克思主义不仅没有过时，而且在今日的环球内继续发挥着其认识世界和改造世界的伟大作用。岂止马克思主义者作如是观。西方的一些从事马克思主义研究、批评的著名学者，也有类似的看法。连萨特也说：“马克思主义远远没有衰竭，还十分年轻，几乎还在童年，它好像刚刚开始发展，所以，它仍然是我们时代的哲学，它是不能扬弃的，因为产生它的环境还没有被扬弃。”萨特认为：“必须用马克思主义的观点思考一切”（萨特：《辩证理性批判》）。R·L·海尔布隆纳说：“我跟萨特一样地深信，马克思主义是我们当代‘必要的’哲学，我这样说的意思是，马克思主义能够使人极大地开拓视野，从历史和社会的角度洞察到我们生活中的症结所在”。他认为：“要探索人类发展的前景，就势必要求教于马克思主义”。他断言：“在我们的时代和今后，世界的改变是肯定无疑的，而且大部分将是在马克思主义本身的鼓舞和指导下进行的。”（R·L·海尔布隆纳：《马克思主义：赞成和反对》）类似的人物和类似的说法为数不少。这里不可能一一引录。
    如果拿这两位名人的名言与搞资产阶级自由化的人的言论比较一下，就可以明显看出，他们的所谓马克思主义是“封闭的”、“狭隘的”、“排他的”、“僵死的”、“丑陋的”之类的喧嚣，所谓“老马理论从头到脚都包含着含糊不清、哗众取宠的词句，这恰合乎当权者的胃口。……是为少数特权阶层服务的，是麻醉品，是奴役我们的枷锁”，以及“把马克思理论赶出中国思想理论舞台”和所谓“设立马克思主义理论课，有悖于人类思想发展规律”的叫嚷，都是上不了台盘的货色。鲁迅说过：“辱骂和恐吓决不是战斗”。搞资产阶级自由化的人，对他们所反对、所敌视的马克思主义一窍不通，拿不出像样的论战货色，当然只能乞灵于辱骂和恐吓，以进行不像样的“战斗”。
    其二，所谓马克思主义适应不了当今世界发展的要求和解决不了当今中国面临的不少问题的论点，更是暴露了搞资产阶级自由化的人对马克思主义理论的本质特征的无知。试问，马克思、恩格斯什么时候，在什么地方答应过为芸芸众生提供包医百病的现成药方和包治各种难题的现成答案？恰恰相反，他们郑重宣布，不主张“竖起任何教条主义的旗帜”，他们的写字台里也没有那种“愚昧的凡俗世界只需张开嘴来接受绝对科学的烤松鸡”。他们一再指明：马克思主义是一个新的世界观，这个世界观不是教义而是方法，它提供的不是现成的教条，而是进一步研究的出发点和供这种研究使用的方法。恩格斯语重心长地说过：“不要生搬硬套马克思和我的话，而要根据自己的情况像马克思那样去思考问题，只有在这个意义上，马克思主义者这个词才有存在的理由。”事情再清楚不过了。我们认为，马克思主义不是适应不了而是完全适应当今世界发展的要求，不是解决不了而是能够卓有成效地指导解决当今中国面临的一切问题，这全然是指马克思主义世界观和方法论的认识和改造的科学威力而言的，而决不是指什么现成的药方和现成的答案。谁把马克思、恩格斯由革命导师、科学巨匠变成算命先生，要求他们未卜先知，把马克思主义由科学的世界观和方法论变成先知的启示录、为尘世排忧解难的谋略总库，然后又通过鞭打自己杜撰的并强加于马克思主义创始人及其学说的这些乌七八糟的东西，以全盘否定马克思主义，这种用心和手段，是很不光彩的。
    搞资产阶级自由化的人，惯用一招不成又来一招的手法。当他们看到全盘否定马克思主义的目的难以得逞时，马上又推出另一种“高论”，说什么：“在百家研究范围里马克思主义至多只能是一家，没有居于一切之上的指导地位”；说什么：“马克思主义在一些极权国家的地位是靠枪杆子、靠政权而取得的、而维护的”；说什么要反对“唯马是举的中国式的思考模式”。这又是一种似是而非的说法。是的，马克思主义在上一世纪的四五十年代，确实是人类思想园地众多学派里的一个年轻的学派。但它在历史的筛选中，不断地夺魁上升。在上一世纪的六七十年代上升为全世界工人运动的主导思想，又在本世纪发生的十月社会主义革命胜利，以及社会主义革命由一国胜利发展到多国胜利后，成为社会主义各国的指导思想，成为传遍全球、震撼世界的最有影响的理论体系。闭着眼睛不承认这一事实，絮絮叨叨地念着马克思主义“只是”、“仅仅是”一个学派的那本经，岂不是像把头埋进沙堆里的鸵鸟一样地可笑。应该强调指出：马克思主义这一学派地位的变化、上升，其奥妙不在于所谓马克思主义者“靠枪杆子为自己的理论开路”、“靠国家机器维护自己的理论的至高无上的位置”，而在于它本身是以实践为基础的严格的科学性与彻底的革命性高度统一的理论体系，是人类思想史上唯一的独具这种优点和特点的理论体系。它完全是靠自身所具有的真理的力量，去打开通向民心之门，打开通往胜利之路的。高校应是马克思主义教育的重要阵地
    历史既然肯定了马克思主义在我们社会主义共和国作为指导思想的地位，那么顺应历史的要求也应把马克思主义理论教育提到应有的高度。这决非争学派地位高低的门户之见。对我们的社会主义、共产主义大业来说，这是为造就青年的马克思主义者、为造就社会主义现代化人才、为造就共产主义事业接班人打基础的需要。
    我们知道，把马克思主义理论教育提到应有的高度，并不是简单作个决定、下个通知就马上可以做到的。这需要有全党、全民的重视、支持和关怀，需要有中央、国务院主管意识形态的领导机关与马克思主义理论教育工作者的协同努力，需要教育主管部门与广大教师就马克思主义理论教育问题冷静地考虑过去、现在与未来，认真地总结经验教训。不言而喻，马克思主义理论教育亟待加强，但要真正地、切实地加强它、提高它，非进行这个领域的师资培养、课程建设、教学方法改进等等方面的大力改革不可。在改革中，对五六十年代积累起来的一些行之有效的经验应予以重视，当然不是原封不动地搬回来，而是要结合80年代的新情况、新课题、新经验加以发扬光大。例如：以往那种重视马克思主义理论教育、尊重马克思主义理论工作者，把他们视为党在思想战线上重要方面军，既严格要求，又在政治上、业务上给予多方关怀的好传统，就应该恢复、充实、提高。以往那种教书育人的教学导向应予充分肯定，并结合今天的具体实际提到新的高度；至于那种把马克思主义理论教育课变成单纯的原著概述、单纯的各种思潮的简介和一般知识的传授，则是不可取的倾向，应力求纠正。以往那种充分发挥教研室在组织教学中的主导作用的好经验，应更好地加以运用。教研室务求在调动教师的主动性、积极性的基础上组织讲题的研讨，进行正确的教学导向。对那种“教师上讲台，怎样轰动就怎样来”的倾向，不能听之任之。以往那种把课堂讨论作为教学的重要环节来抓的做法，应更好地加以实施，让学生在生动活泼的讨论中交流看法、提高认识。
