Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th.

Li Peng, during a meeting with foreign guests, discussed the seven matters of concern to the masses. He emphasized that the Central Party and the State Council have decided to focus on these seven issues in the near future, highlighting two key points: first, leading by example from the central level; second, addressing specific and practical issues in a down-to-earth manner.

He stated that the Central Party hopes that all regions and departments will, in accordance with the spirit of the Central Party's decision, formulate specific regulations for anti-corruption efforts based on their own realities. This will help turn the Central Party's decisions into conscious actions.

Li Peng made these remarks during a meeting with Yang Yongzhu, the president of the French newspaper "Europe Times," who was visiting China.

Li Peng briefed her on the current domestic situation. He said that some Westerners view the lifting of martial law in Beijing as a sign of China's stability, which is a one-sided perspective. He stated: "Currently, China's situation is stable. The continuation of martial law is necessary to further consolidate and develop the stable situation; martial law not only does not hinder but also helps to maintain social order and ensure the safety of foreign guests during their activities." He pointed out that some Western governments use the lifting of martial law in China as a precondition for lifting their sanctions against China, which is interference in China's internal affairs and is unacceptable to us.

When discussing the lessons learned from the recent suppression of the unrest, Li Peng said: We must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, strengthen political and ideological work, and strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and legal system to fundamentally eliminate the factors that cause unrest. If similar unrest occurs in the future, all levels of government should resolutely and timely suppress it in its infancy. This is an important lesson.

Li Peng reviewed the development of Sino-French friendship. He said that the friendship between the Chinese and French peoples has a long history. Early progressive ideas in France had a positive impact on the Chinese revolution. At the beginning of this century, a group of old revolutionary leaders of the Chinese proletariat, such as Premier Zhou Enlai and Chairman Deng Xiaoping, studied and worked in France. In the early 1960s, General Charles de Gaulle, with his foresight, made the decisive decision to establish diplomatic relations with China. After the establishment of diplomatic relations, the political, economic, scientific, technological, cultural, and other exchanges between the two countries, as well as the friendly interactions between the peoples, have developed significantly.

Li Peng said: Recently, there have been difficulties in the relations between the two countries, which is not due to the Chinese side. "We will, as always, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to maintain and develop relations with France." He hopes that the Sino-French friendly relations initiated by Chairman Mao Zedong, Premier Zhou Enlai, and General Charles de Gaulle will not be damaged. However, he said, whether this can be achieved depends on the French side.

Li Peng, at the request of the guest, talked about the Chinese government's policy towards Chinese students studying abroad. He said that some students studying abroad, including those in France, during the turmoil and riots in Beijing, due to their lack of understanding of the true situation at home and the influence of distorted Western propaganda, had some confused thoughts and even extreme words and deeds, which is understandable, and the government will not pursue this.

He expressed his belief that as they learn the truth, the students will gradually change their views and will surely draw lessons from their experiences, increasing their ability to discern complex issues. The Party and the government hope that the students will study hard, return home after graduation, and participate in the construction of the Four Modernizations.

At the end of the meeting, Madame Yang Yongzhu presented Li Peng with a commemorative medal for the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. Li Peng happily accepted the gift. Li Peng said, the French Revolution overthrew the feudal monarchy, and like the Paris Commune, it played an important role in promoting historical progress.

Madame Yang Yongzhu thanked Li Peng for taking the time to have a long conversation with her. She said that "Europe Times" will continue to work to promote mutual understanding and friendship between France and China.

    李鹏会见外宾时谈办好群众关心的七件事
    中央做表率　踏踏实实办
    各地各部门要结合实际做出廉政建设具体规定
    新华社北京7月29日电  李鹏总理今天在会见外宾时说，党中央、国务院决定近期做七件群众关心的事有两个特点：一、从中央做起，起表率作用；二、抓具体的、切实的事，踏踏实实地做。
    他说，中央希望各地区、各部门按照中央决定的精神，结合自己的实际，做出廉政建设的具体规定，以便把中央决定的精神变成他们的自觉行动。
    李鹏是在会见正在这里访问的法国《欧洲时报》社长杨永桔女士时说这番话的。
    李鹏向她介绍了目前国内局势。他说，有的西方人士把中国首都是否取消戒严作为中国局势是否稳定的标志，这种看法是片面的。他说：“目前中国的局势是稳定的。继续戒严是进一步巩固和发展稳定局势的需要；戒严非但不妨碍而且有利于维护社会的正常秩序和保证外宾进行活动时的安全。”他指出：有的西方政府把中国是否取消戒严作为其取消对中国制裁措施的先决条件，这是对中国内政的干涉，是我们不能接受的。
    在谈到这次平暴的经验教训时，李鹏说：要坚持四项基本原则，加强政治思想工作，加强社会主义的民主和法制建设，从根本上消除产生动乱的各种因素。如果今后再出现动乱这一类的事情，各级政府就应该坚决地、不失时机地将它制止在萌芽状态，这是一条重要的教训。
    李鹏总理回顾了中法友谊的发展。他说，中法两国人民之间的友谊源远流长。法国早期的一些进步思想曾对中国革命起了积极的作用。本世纪初，中国的一批老一辈无产阶级革命家如周恩来总理和邓小平主席等，都曾在法国学习、工作过。60年代初，戴高乐将军以其远见卓识作出了同中国建立外交关系的果断决策。两国建交后，中法两国政治、经济、科技、文化等各领域内的关系，以及人民之间的友好交往，都有很大发展。
    李鹏总理说：最近两国关系出现了困难，这不是中国方面的原因。“我们将一如既往地根据和平共处五项原则，保持和发展同法国的关系。”他希望由毛泽东主席、周恩来总理和戴高乐将军共同开创的中法友好关系不受到损害。但他说，能否做到这一点，取决于法国方面。
    李鹏应客人的要求谈到了中国政府对在国外学习的中国留学生的政策。他说，一些在国外学习的留学生，包括在法国的留学生，在北京发生动乱和暴乱期间，由于不了解国内的真实情况，加上受西方歪曲宣传的影响，思想出现一些混乱，甚至有些过激言行，这是可以理解的，政府不会追究。
    他表示相信，随着对事实真相的了解，留学生会逐步改变自己的看法，并一定会认真总结经验教训，增加对复杂事物的识别能力。党和政府希望留学生努力学习，学成回国参加四化建设。
    会见结束时，杨永桔女士向李鹏总理赠送了一枚法国大革命200周年纪念章。李鹏总理高兴地接受了这一礼品。李鹏说，法国大革命推翻了封建王朝，它同巴黎公社一样，都在推动历史前进上起过重要的作用。
    杨永桔女士感谢李鹏总理在百忙中同她进行了长时间的谈话。她表示，《欧洲时报》将为增进法中相互了解和友谊继续作出努力。
