Vietnamese forces invading Cambodia have continued their attacks on resistance forces along the Cambodia-Thailand border (from Thailand's Prachinburi Province to Chachoengsao Province), with many shells falling into Thai territory, forcing Thai civilians to retreat.

The Bangkok Post reported today that while the four-party talks on Cambodia were being held in Paris, the Vietnamese forces invading Cambodia intensified their attacks on the resistance forces yesterday. Vietnamese troops first attacked the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) forces over the weekend, and then attacked the forces of the Khmer Rouge. In the fighting, about 30 shells fell into Thai territory, causing three Thai border schools to suspend classes, and about 700 students and a large number of Thai civilians to evacuate to safe areas.

The report said that a Thai military spokesman, Naradol, pointed out that Vietnam's military actions show that Vietnam has not, as it claimed, withdrawn its troops 30 kilometers from the Cambodia-Thailand border. Instead, Vietnam has intensified its military attacks, which is contradictory to its repeated claims of withdrawing from Cambodia. (Accompanying photo)

On July 24, Cambodian refugees escaping from the shelling camped in the open. The Phnom Penh regime's puppet army has been shelling the 8th refugee camp on the Thai-Cambodian border for days, forcing more than 30,000 refugees living there to flee.

    侵柬越军进攻抵抗力量
    战火蔓延危及泰国边民
    本报曼谷7月26日电　记者刘爱成报道：侵柬越军继续在柬泰边境（泰国巴真府至庄他武里府对面）向柬抵抗力量发动猛烈进攻，许多炮弹落入泰境，迫使泰国边民后撤。
    此间《曼谷邮报》今天报道说，当柬四方会谈在巴黎举行时，侵柬越军对柬抵抗力量部队的进攻昨天更加猛烈。越南军队在上周末首先进攻民柬部队，接着又进攻高棉人民民族解放阵线部队。在战斗中，约有30发炮弹落入泰境，致使三所泰国边境学校被迫停课，700名学生及大批泰国边民转移到安全地带。
    报道说，泰国军方发言人纳罗敦指出，越南的军事行动表明，越南并没有像它所宣称的那样使其部队从柬泰边境后撤30公里，而且越南加强武力进攻与它所反复宣称的从柬撤军相矛盾。（附图片）
