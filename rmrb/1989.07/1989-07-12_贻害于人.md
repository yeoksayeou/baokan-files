A farmer in Nigeria woke up one day to find that someone had unloaded tens of thousands of barrels and 25 containers of industrial waste on his land. Later, he discovered that the containers held highly toxic industrial waste. The Argentine newspaper *Somos* reported that the farmer was at a loss as to what to do with the toxic waste dumped by a Western European country.

The disposal of industrial waste, including radioactive nuclear waste and other toxic substances, has long been a headache for some industrialized countries. According to a report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, the United States produces 250 million tons of toxic waste annually. Some Western European countries also produce large amounts of toxic waste each year. Since there is currently no perfect method for handling industrial waste, companies that produce large amounts of toxic waste in developed countries have become the target of public criticism. Under strong public pressure, these countries' governments have made legal regulations for the disposal of industrial waste. However, disposing of industrial waste according to regulations incurs high costs for companies.

In this situation, some companies in the United States and Western Europe have come up with the idea of "exporting" industrial waste to developing countries, especially those in Africa and Latin America. Their plan is to achieve two goals at once: first, to avoid public condemnation for polluting their own environments; second, to save a lot of money. According to reports, the current cost of incinerating industrial waste is $300 per ton, while "exporting" it to some developing countries costs only $30 per ton.

Companies and enterprises in Europe and America only care about their own interests, regardless of the consequences for others. According to reports, the 250 million tons of toxic waste produced in the United States are all "exported" to some developing countries. Each ton of this waste contains 9 kilograms of harmful substances, such as detergents, solvents, pesticides, engine oil, and other toxic chemical waste. Some of the waste even contains radioactive materials. A foreign news agency quoted experts as saying: The harmful effects of these toxic industrial wastes on human health, animals, and plants, although slow, are equivalent to the damage caused by a world war, especially considering that these wastes contain radioactive materials. No wonder some people call the "export" of waste a "dangerous deal."

Some companies and enterprises in developed countries, fearing the growing international opposition, do not dare to openly "export" waste but instead engage in secret transactions. According to reports, due to the profits involved, a competitive black market has already formed. For example, off the coast of Africa, ships carrying industrial waste, known as "ghost ships," disguise themselves, evade coastal patrol boats, and secretly unload toxic waste onto beaches or remote fishing villages. Some of it is even dumped into the sea.

The self-serving practices of some companies and enterprises in developed countries have naturally met with opposition from developing countries. Some countries and organizations have demanded that the United Nations prohibit the establishment of storage facilities for industrial waste from developed countries on their territories. The Organization of African Unity condemned developed countries for treating African territories as dumping grounds and prohibited the dumping of waste in Africa.

    贻害于人
    张金江
    尼日利亚一位农场主一觉醒来，发现他的地里不知被谁卸下上万只桶和25个集装箱。稍后他才知道，里面装的是剧毒工业垃圾。阿根廷的《索莫斯》报道说，面对西欧某国卸下的这堆剧毒垃圾，那位农场主不知所措。
    工业垃圾，包括带有放射性的核废料和其他有毒物的处理一直是令一些工业发达国家头痛的老大难问题。据美国总审计局的报告，美国每年产生2.5亿吨有毒垃圾。西欧一些国家每年也产生大量有毒废物。由于目前对工业垃圾还没有一个尽善尽美的处理方法，产生大量有毒垃圾的企业在发达国家就成了众矢之的。在公众的强大压力下，这些国家政府对工业垃圾的处理都作了法律规定。但是，按照规定处理工业垃圾，企业就要付出高额代价。
    在这种情况下，美国和西欧一些发达国家的企业想出了向发展中国家特别是非洲和拉丁美洲国家“出口”工业垃圾的“高招”。他们的如意算盘是一石两鸟：首先可以躲避因污染本国环境受到公众的强烈谴责；第二可以节约大量资金。据报道，目前用焚化的方法处理工业垃圾每吨成本达300美元，而向一些发展中国家“出口”，每吨只需付30美元。
    欧美工业发达国家的公司、企业只顾自己得“鸟”，不管别人死活。据报道，美国产生的2.5亿吨的有毒垃圾都被“出口”到一些发展中国家。这些垃圾每吨含有9公斤有害物质，例如洗涤剂、溶剂、杀虫剂、机油及其他有毒化学废料。甚至有的垃圾中还含有放射性物质。一家外国通讯社引用专家们的话说：这些有毒工业垃圾对人类健康、动植物造成的有害影响，尽管是缓慢的，但是却与一场世界大战造成的危害相同，特别是考虑到这些垃圾中还含有放射性物质。难怪有人把垃圾“出口”称为“危险的交易”。
    发达国家一些公司、企业慑于越来越强烈的世界舆论的反对，“出口”垃圾不敢光明正大地进行，而是偷偷摸摸暗地里交易。据报道，由于有利可图，现在已形成了一个竞争激烈的黑市场。例如在非洲海岸，被称为“鬼怪船”的运送工业垃圾的轮船伪装后，躲过海岸巡逻艇的检查，偷偷把有毒废料卸在海滩或偏僻的渔村，有的就被扔到海底。
    发达国家一些公司企业这种损人利己的做法理所当然遭到发展中国家的反对。一些国家和组织要求联合国禁止在本国领土建立储存发达国家工业垃圾的场所。非洲统一组织谴责发达国家把非洲领土当成垃圾场，禁止向非洲倾倒垃圾。
