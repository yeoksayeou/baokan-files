Many days are carved into the green stone. Under the sculptor’s chisel, they silently take the shape of remembrance. Remembrance, originally a sharp-edged, almost primitive emotion, has been weathered by the rain of years and the tides of time. With the hammering and chiseling, and soaked with what might be sweat, blood, or tears, it becomes polished, refined, and even capable of reflecting the sun of ancient and modern times. Thus, the footsteps of later generations deepen the carvings on the stone. Thus, the banner raised by the heart leads the wandering children back to their longing—

The heart of a child is a priceless treasure. Once a name is fused with the blood of the nation, it completely bids farewell to the indifference of oblivion. The waves of the blue sea carry pairs of footsteps, widening and lengthening the path that crosses time and space.
