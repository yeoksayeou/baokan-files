Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 9th.

China's largest steel and iron complex, Anshan Iron and Steel Company, has completed its 40-year journey since its commencement. Over the past 40 years, Anshan Steel has produced 186 million tons of steel, 181 million tons of pig iron, and 115 million tons of steel products for the nation, contributing nearly 40 billion yuan in profits and taxes. This amount is equivalent to seven times the total investment the nation made in Anshan Steel's construction during the same period.

Anshan Steel, which began construction in 1916, was technologically backward and developed slowly under the rule of the Japanese invaders and the reactionary Kuomintang. By February 1948, when it was liberated, most of its main production equipment had been looted or severely damaged, leaving the plant in ruins and desolation. The workers of Anshan Steel launched a large-scale campaign to recover spare parts and donate materials, enabling the plant to officially commence operations 40 years ago today.

Over the past 40 years, under the care of the Party and the state, and with the support of the people across the nation, several generations of Anshan Steel workers have struggled tirelessly. They have transformed this dilapidated old enterprise left over from the old society into a modern steel base. Today, Anshan Steel is a steel and iron complex with a workforce of 400,000, producing 800 million tons of iron, 820 million tons of steel, and 580 million tons of steel products annually, with fixed assets exceeding 10 billion yuan. From initially being able to produce only 48 types of steel and 33 types of steel products, Anshan Steel has developed to be able to smelt over 700 types of steel, roll nearly 400 types, and produce over 7,000 specifications of steel products. Yesterday, Anshan Steel passed the acceptance and inspection by relevant departments of the Ministry of Metallurgy, Liaoning Province, and Anshan City, meeting the standards of a first-class national enterprise.

    鞍钢人奋斗四十春秋为国家赚回七个鞍钢
    近日通过国家一级企业验收考核
    据新华社沈阳7月9日电（记者陈光明）我国最大的钢铁联合企业鞍山钢铁公司今天走完了它开工40年的历程。40年来，鞍钢共为国家生产钢1.86亿吨，生铁1.81亿吨，钢材1.15亿吨，上交利税近400亿元，相当于国家同期对鞍钢基建总投资的7倍。
    始建于1916年的鞍钢在日伪、国民党反动统治下，生产技术落后，发展缓慢。到1948年2月解放时，这里的主要生产设备已被掠走或严重破坏，厂区一片荒芜和冷寂。鞍钢职工开展了大规模的回收备件、献交器材的恢复生产运动，使鞍钢于40年前的今天正式开工。
    40年来，鞍钢在党和国家的关怀和全国人民支援下，经过几代人艰苦卓绝的奋斗，终使这个旧社会留下来破烂不堪的老企业迅速崛起，如今，已成为拥有40万钢铁生产大军的现代化钢铁基地，成为年产铁800万吨、钢820万吨、钢材580万吨、固定资产超100亿元的钢铁联合企业。由开工初期只能生产48个钢种，33个钢材品种，发展为能冶炼700多个钢种，轧制近400多个品种，7000多个规格的钢材。昨天，鞍钢通过了由冶金部、辽宁省和鞍山市有关部门的验收考核，达到国家一级企业标准。
