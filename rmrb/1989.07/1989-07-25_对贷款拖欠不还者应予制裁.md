Recently, in our efforts to recover loans by law, we have discovered that some individuals have been defaulting on large loans from banks and credit cooperatives for many years. A private automobile transport operator in Yangcunzi Township borrowed over 110,000 yuan in 1984, and to date, the principal and interest total over 140,000 yuan. This operator indulges in eating, drinking, and entertainment, and when credit officers demand repayment, he simply disappears.

Credit officers who cause losses by issuing loans should be held accountable for economic, administrative, or even legal responsibilities, depending on the circumstances. However, those who squander loans remain unpunished, which is truly baffling.

To reduce the country's financial losses, relevant departments should take measures to penalize those who default on loans.

    对贷款拖欠不还者应予制裁
    最近，我们在依法收贷中，发现一些户拖欠银行、信用社的大额贷款多年。杨村子镇一个体汽车客运户，1984年借贷款11万多元，至今本息合计14万多元。这个户主吃喝玩乐，信贷员向他催要贷款，他却一走了之。
    信贷人员发放贷款造成损失，要区别情况追究经济的、行政的甚至法律责任。但是，挥霍贷款者却逍遥自在，受不到任何制裁，这实在令人难以理解。
    为了减少国家的资金损失，有关部门应采取措施，对那些拖欠贷款不还者给予制裁。
