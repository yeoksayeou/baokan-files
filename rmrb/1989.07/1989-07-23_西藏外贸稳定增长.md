Tibet's foreign trade has shown steady growth in the first half of this year. According to statistics from the Tibet Autonomous Region's Foreign Economic and Trade Bureau, the total value of Tibet's imports and exports for the first half of the year reached over $13 million. The export value completed 64% of the annual plan, a 22% increase over the same period last year. The import value increased by 5.91 times compared to the same period last year.

Since the beginning of summer this year, trade across the China-Nepal border has been particularly active. Light industrial products and daily necessities needed by Nepalese citizens, as well as some special products required by ethnic minorities in Tibet's border regions, are exchanged through the three border ports of Zhangmu, Gyirong, and Pulan, and more than 10 traditional border trade markets.

    西藏外贸稳定增长
    据新华社拉萨7月23日电　（记者张春保）今年上半年西藏外贸稳定增长。据西藏自治区对外经济贸易厅统计，上半年西藏对外贸易进出口总额达1300多万美元，出口额完成年计划的64％，比去年同期增长22％；进口额比去年同期增长5.91倍。
    今年入夏以来，中尼边境贸易尤为活跃。尼泊尔王国边民所需的轻工产品、生活必需品，西藏边境地区所需的一些民族特需产品，通过中尼边境线上的樟木、吉隆、普兰三个边境口岸和10多个传统边民互贸市场进行交流。
