    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 6th.

    The water level at the Yangtze River's Wuhan Water Control Point has risen to 24.99 meters by 3 PM today, exceeding the defense water level by 0.49 meters. The water level is still rising.

    According to the Wuhan City Flood Control Headquarters, the water level at the Wuhan Water Control Point has been higher than the same period last year since March this year.

    This flood is mainly caused by the heavy to torrential rains that have fallen in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River, as well as in the Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake regions in recent days.

    长江武汉关水位超过设防线
    新华社武汉7月6日电（通讯员张起、记者詹仲德）记者从武汉市防汛指挥部获悉：长江武汉关水位到今天下午3时，已涨至24.99米，超过设防水位0.49米，目前水位仍在上涨。
    据武汉市防汛指挥部介绍，今年3月以来长江武汉关水位都高于去年同期水位。
    这次洪水上涨主要是近段时间，长江中上游及洞庭湖、鄱阳湖地区普降中到大雨所致。
