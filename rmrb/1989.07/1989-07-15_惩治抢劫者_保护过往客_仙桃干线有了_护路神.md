    The city of Xiantao in Hubei Province has relied on the power of the masses to establish road patrol teams, severely cracking down on criminals who rob on major transportation routes.

    Xiantao is a key junction between Wuhan and Shashi, with a dense network of roads and a high volume of passenger traffic. Some lawless elements have taken advantage of this to rob passengers on the road. From January to March this year alone, there were 23 cases of robbery on the main transportation routes, seriously threatening the lives and property of passing drivers and travelers. Since April, the Xiantao Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have made combating road robbery a key focus of their comprehensive efforts to maintain social order. The Municipal Party Committee's standing committee members and deputy mayors have implemented a responsibility system for road safety segments. Along the three main roads, each township, town, village, and factory has been equipped with full-time road guards, forming a network of patrol teams. So far, the city has 332 road patrol teams with a total of 1,612 members.

    The road patrol team members take turns on duty, patrolling day and night, and using tactics such as concealment and disguise to strike at criminals. In just the recent period, they have apprehended 52 road robbery criminals.

    惩治抢劫者  保护过往客
    仙桃干线有了“护路神”
    本报讯  湖北省仙桃市依靠群众力量，建立护路巡逻队，严厉打击在交通干线上拦路抢劫的犯罪分子。
    仙桃是武汉和沙市的联结点，公路交错，客流量大，一些不法分子趁机拦路抢劫。仅今年1至3月，交通干线上发生拦路抢劫案件23起，严重威胁着过往司机和旅客的生命财产安全。4月以来，仙桃市委、市政府把打击拦路抢劫犯罪活动作为综合治理社会治安的重点，市委常委和正副市长实行公路治安段面包干责任制，在3条主要公路沿线各乡、镇和各村、厂都配备了专职护路员，组建了护路队，形成了联防网络。到目前为止，全市共有护路队332支、1612人。
    护路队员轮流执勤，昼夜巡逻，运用潜伏、伪装等形式打击了罪犯，仅近一时期就抓获拦路抢劫犯罪分子52人。
