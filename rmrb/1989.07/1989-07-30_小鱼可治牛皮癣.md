Turkish people have a "biological therapy" for psoriasis, which involves letting a type of small fish that has a preference for scales to clean the psoriasis off the patient's body. This small fish grows in the thermal springs of Kangal in Turkey.

Every day, hundreds of psoriasis patients travel to a little-known place in central Turkey. They spend about 25 cents to rent a spot, strip naked, and submerge themselves in the water. Schools of fish known as "doctor fish" swim over and nibble at the psoriasis scales on the patients' bodies, leaving healthy skin untouched.

After about two hours, the patients emerge from the pool, their psoriasis completely gone, with no scales or dead skin remaining.

    小鱼可治牛皮癣
    土耳其人对牛皮癣有一种
  “生物疗法”，那就是患者让生而有嗜痂之癖的一种小鱼，把身上的牛皮癣来一次“吃”的大清理。这种小鱼生长在土耳其坎加尔温泉池中。
    每天，上百个牛皮癣患者到土耳其中部少为人知的小地方来，他们花上约二角五分美金，租一个位置，脱光衣服浸在水里。成群的被称为“清道夫”鱼游来团团围住，吮啄患者身上癣屑，而对好皮肤却毫无兴趣。
    大约两个小时之后，患者从水池起来，身上的牛皮癣已经不见，痂屑和腐肉亦一点不剩。
