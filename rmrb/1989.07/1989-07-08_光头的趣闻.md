Women keep their hair, men shave their heads, this seems to have become a "rule," but there are exceptions. In Africa, there is a nomadic tribe called the Maasai. These tall Maasai people are different from others in that the men have countless small braids, while the women shave their heads clean and shiny.

The weight of human hair can sometimes be "a hair's breadth." During the 1948 London Olympics, Argentine athlete A. Baris, while competing in the 52.5-kilogram weightlifting event, was found to be slightly overweight. The news spread immediately, causing a stir. Baris' supporters came up with a brilliant idea: they shaved his head. Baris cried for a few minutes over his lost beautiful hair. As a result, Baris' weight just made the standard, and he qualified for the competition. Although this "bald" athlete eventually became a failure at the Olympics, his "bald" anecdote was recorded in Olympic history.

There was a beautiful woman in the United States named Annie Monton. She was once a model and later became a feminist activist. She protested against the Miss California beauty pageant by shaving her own golden hair off in public, becoming bald, as a form of protest.

Strangely enough, a bald head can also express intimate feelings. In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, there was a middle-aged man named Manuel Garcia who suffered from stomach cancer. After surgery, his hair fell out, leaving him bald. Just as he was preparing to leave the hospital, more than thirty bald men suddenly walked into his room. Manuel was first startled, then overjoyed, for they were all his friends and relatives. These friends, to ease Manuel's "bald" pain, had all shaved their heads and organized a unique bald welcome party, which caused a sensation at the time.

Interestingly, bald heads even have their own organizations. In the United States, there is a "Bald Club," whose members are spread across various states. This club holds an annual bald competition to see who can win the crown for the "smoothest head." When a reporter asked a winner about his feelings, the bald champion smiled and said, "There are many dark sides to the world today, but I hope my bald head can make the world a little brighter."

    光头的趣闻
    女人留发，男人剃光头，这似乎已成了一条“规律”，然而却有例外。非洲有个游牧部落叫马赛族，这些身材高大的马赛人与众最大的不同就是男人留着无数条小辫子，而女人们则把头剃得精光发亮。
    人头发的分量，有时“一发千钧”。一九四八年伦敦奥运会期间，阿根廷运动员A·巴里斯在参加五十二点五公斤举重比赛时，经测量体重超出了一点点。消息传出，立即引起一场风波。巴里斯的支持者们想出了一个绝妙的主意，剃光了他的头发，巴里斯为了他那一头漂亮的头发还痛哭了几分钟。结果巴里斯的体重正好轧进标准内，获得了比赛的资格。虽说这位“光头”选手后来还是成为奥运会上的失败者，但他的“光头”趣闻，却记载进奥运会史上。
    美国有个叫安茜蒙顿的美女，她曾是模特儿，后来成为美国的女权活动分子。她在加州小姐选美会场外抗议选美，她当众剃光自己的金发，成了一个光头，以示抗议。
    说来你不信，光头还能寄托亲密的感情哩。美国密尔沃基城有位名叫马纽尔·嘉希的中年男子患了胃癌，手术后，他的头发脱落一光，成了光头。正当他准备出院，又为光头犯愁时，病房里突然走进来三十多个光头，马纽尔先是吓一跳，后是一喜，原来都是自己的亲朋好友。这些亲友们为了能减轻马尔纽的“光头”痛苦，都剃了个光头，并组织了一个举世无双的光头欢迎会，从而轰动一时。
    有趣的是，光头还有自己的组织。美国有个“光头俱乐部”，它的成员遍及美国各州，这个俱乐部每年都要举行一次光头比赛，看谁能摘下“最光滑的头”的桂冠。当记者问一位获奖者的感受时，这位光头冠军笑着说：“当今世界上黑暗面甚多，但愿我的光头能稍稍使世界变得明朗些。”
