The situation in the second stage of the Qiong Lian Cup Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament has become unclear due to the outcome of the match between Ma Xiaochun, 9th dan, and Qian Yeping, 9th dan. Before this, Qian Yeping was the only player among the eight who had entered the round-robin stage without a loss.

In yesterday's fourth round, Ma Xiaochun, playing black, took the lead from the beginning. He attacked on all fronts, capturing territory, and put Qian Yeping in a passive position. Despite Qian Yeping's repeated long deliberations, he could not find a good strategy to defeat the black pieces. In the end, black won in the middle game.

The match between Nie Weiping, 9th dan, and Cheng Xiaoli, 6th dan, ended the earliest. Nie, the Weiqi Saint, seemed to have regained his best form. He played swiftly, and in the end, white won in the middle game.

The results of the other two games were: female player Yang Hui, 7th dan, playing black, won against Wang Qun, 8th dan, by three and three-quarters of a point. Yang Jinhua, 6th dan (black), lost in the middle game to Yu Bin, 8th dan. Before the noon sealing of the game, Yang Jinhua was in a good position, but Yu Bin fought back fiercely, calculated precisely, and turned the passive situation around.

This afternoon, chess enthusiasts who came specially from Haikou City and local chess enthusiasts in Sanya had a series of exciting car wheel battles with Chen Zude, 9th dan, Hua Yijang, 8th dan, Liu Xiaoguang, 9th dan, Wu Zhaoyi, 7th dan, and Hua Xueming, 6th dan. They expressed their gratitude to the professional chess players of the Chinese Weiqi Team for their chess skills. They said that the Chinese Weiqi Team's visit to Hainan would play a positive role in promoting and developing the Weiqi sport in Hainan Province.

    中国围棋名人战第二阶段比赛局势不明朗
    第四轮聂棋圣落子如飞中盘胜
    本报三亚7月8日电　记者陈昭报道：由于马晓春九段和钱宇平九段之战的结果，使得琼联杯中国围棋名人战第二阶段比赛的前景变得扑朔迷离起来。在此之前，钱宇平是八位进入循环圈的比赛中唯一的没有输过的棋手。
    在昨日进行的第四轮比赛中，执黑先行的马晓春从一开始就占有优势，他四处出击，搜刮地盘，使钱宇平陷入被动之中，尽管钱宇平多次长考，但都未得出击败黑棋的良策，最后黑子中盘胜。
    聂卫平九段与程晓流六段的比赛最早结束战斗。聂棋圣显然恢复了较佳状态，他落子如飞，最后执白中盘胜。
    另外两盘棋的结果是，女棋手杨晖七段执黑胜王群八段三又四分之三子。杨晋华六段
  （黑子）中盘负于俞斌八段。杨晋华在中午封盘以前本来形势不错，但俞斌奋力反击，算度精确，扭转了被动局面。
    今天下午，专程从海口市赶来的棋迷和三亚市棋迷还与陈祖德九段、华以刚八段、刘小光九段、吴兆毅七段以及华学明六段进行了十几盘妙趣横生的车轮大战，他们非常感谢中国围棋队的专业棋手们与他们切磋棋艺。他们说，此次中国围棋队的海南之行，对于普及和推动海南省的围棋运动发展，将起到积极的作用。
