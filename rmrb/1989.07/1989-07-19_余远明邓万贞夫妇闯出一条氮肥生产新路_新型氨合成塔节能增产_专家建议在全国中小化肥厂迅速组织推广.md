The People's Daily reports that the couple, Yu Yuanming and Deng Wanzhen, who recently obtained the patent for the "YD-type Cold Excitation Ammonia Synthesis Tower," have made significant breakthroughs in improving production technology for medium and small nitrogen fertilizer plants. By installing the newly designed ammonia synthesis tower internals in existing nitrogen fertilizer plants, the production of nitrogen fertilizer can be increased by more than 40%, the total energy consumption can be reduced by 15%, and the factory's economic benefits can be doubled. Experts believe that this technology has significant social benefits and recommend its rapid promotion in medium and small nitrogen fertilizer plants across the country.

Yu and Deng were originally lecturers in the Chemical Engineering Department of Guizhou Institute of Technology. With the support and assistance of some domestic experts in the same field, they have been dedicated to researching the "Optimal Design of Cold Excitation Ammonia Synthesis Tower" since 1980. The project passed the technical appraisal organized by the Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Commission in 1984. In 1985, with the support of the Chemical Industry Department, Guizhou Provincial Fertilizer Company, and other relevant departments, this technology was first applied industrially at the Linxiang Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant in Hunan Province, successfully starting up on the first attempt. In recent years, this technology has been promoted and applied in more than a dozen nitrogen fertilizer plants in eight provinces. In 1987, the Yueyang Nitrogen Fertilizer Plant invested 2 million yuan to install this new type of internal component in an ammonia synthesis tower with a diameter of 600 millimeters. That year, the plant produced an additional 40,000 tons of nitrogen fertilizer, increasing its production capacity by more than 40% compared to the previous year. It saved 7,800 tons of coal and 3.3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity, reducing the total energy consumption by 15%. After adopting this new technology, the plant's annual net economic benefit increased by more than 20 million yuan. According to relevant experts, if this technology is widely adopted in medium and small nitrogen fertilizer plants across the country, it can annually produce an additional 1,000 tons of fertilizer, save 4-5 million tons of coal, and save more than 1 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. The annual net economic benefit can exceed 1 billion yuan.

    余远明邓万贞夫妇闯出一条氮肥生产新路
    新型氨合成塔节能增产
    专家建议在全国中小化肥厂迅速组织推广
    本报讯　记者王友恭从中国民办科技实业家协会获悉：近日获得“YD型冷激式氨合成塔”专利的贵州远明化工节能设计研究所所长、高级工程师余远明和邓万贞夫妇，研究、改进我国中、小氮肥厂生产技术取得一项重大突破。现有的氮肥厂改装上他们设计研制成功的新式氨合成塔内件后，氮肥产量可以增产40％以上，总能耗下降15％，工厂经济效益可以翻番。专家们认为这项技术社会效益显著，建议在全国中小化肥厂迅速组织推广。
    余、邓原是贵州工学院化工系讲师。在国内一些同行专家的关心、帮助下，从1980年以来他们便苦心钻研，“冷激式氨合成塔设计最优化”课题于1984年通过贵州省科委主持的技术鉴定。1985年，在化工部、贵州省化肥公司等有关部门的支持下，这项技术首先在湖南省临湘氮肥厂投入工业应用，一次开车成功。近年来，这项技术已在8省十几家氮肥厂中得到推广应用。1987年岳阳市氮肥厂投资20万元，在直径600毫米的氨合成塔上改装上这种新型内件后，当年增产氮肥4万吨，生产能力比上一年提高40％以上；节煤7800多吨；节电330多万度，总能耗下降15％。该厂使用这项新技术之后，全年净增经济效益200多万元。据有关专家计算，我国的中、小氮肥厂普遍使用这项技术后，每年可增产化肥1000多万吨，节煤400万—500万吨，节电10亿度以上；全年净增经济效益10亿元以上。
