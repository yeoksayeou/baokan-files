The Chinese Embassy in the United States issued a statement today regarding Chinese students participating in protests. The statement said, "It is completely normal for Chinese students to be concerned about the situation in their home country. The Chinese government has already stated that it will adopt a tolerant attitude towards their participation in certain protests and gatherings, without holding them accountable, as they did not fully understand the facts."

This statement is a response to a letter sent by 14 U.S. congressmen in mid-June to the Chinese Embassy. In the letter, these congressmen baselessly accused Chinese diplomatic missions in the U.S. of threatening and surveilling Chinese students.

The statement said, "The contact and interaction between Chinese diplomatic missions and officials in the U.S. and Chinese students and citizens in the U.S. are part of normal official duties. These activities are conducted within the scope permitted by U.S. law, international law, and diplomatic customs."

The Chinese Embassy stated: "The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. and its consulates have never organized or engaged in activities such as photography, videotaping, conversations, and other activities aimed at surveilling, interfering with, or threatening our own students studying abroad."

The statement pointed out, "Some news media reports on the above issues are inaccurate and baseless."

    我驻美使馆发表声明
    所谓“威胁”“监视”我留学人员毫无根据
    新华社华盛顿7月4日电　中国驻美国大使馆今天就中国留学生参加游行示威活动一事发表声明说，“中国留学人员对国内形势的发展感到关切是完全正常的；对他们在不了解事实真相的情况下参加的一些游行集会等活动，中国政府业已表明将以宽容的态度对待，不予追究”。
    这份声明是对14名美国议员6月中旬致中国使馆一封来信的答复。这些议员在信中毫无根据地指责中国驻美外交机构对中国留学人员进行“威胁”和“监视”。
    声明说，中国驻美外交机构及外交官员同在美的中国留学生及公民联系和接触“属于正常的公务”；“这些活动都是在美国法律、国际法和外交惯例所允许的范围内进行的”。
    中国大使馆声明：“中国驻美使馆及各领馆从未组织或从事过以监视、干扰和威胁本国留学人员为目的照相、录像、谈话等活动以及其它活动”。
    声明指出，“某些新闻媒介关于上述问题的报道是不符合事实的、毫无根据的”。
