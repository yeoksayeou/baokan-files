The European Community and Poland concluded economic and trade negotiations on July 25.

The agreement is valid for five years. In the economic sphere, both sides plan to develop cooperation in the fields of energy, transportation, mining, tourism, health, and agriculture, and are prepared to vigorously establish joint ventures. In terms of trade exchanges, the agreement lists a series of industrial and agricultural products that can enjoy favorable tariff conditions. It also stipulates that from now until 1995, the majority of quantitative restrictions on each other's imported and exported products will be gradually eliminated.

The European Community has already signed economic and trade cooperation agreements with Czechoslovakia and Hungary, and similar agreements with the Soviet Union are under negotiation, with talks with Bulgaria also having begun. Following the summit of the seven Western countries, economic relations between the European Community and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are rapidly developing.

    波兰欧共体达成经贸协议
    本报布鲁塞尔7月26日电  记者魏崴报道：欧洲共同体和波兰的经济贸易谈判于25日达成协议。
    协议为期5年。在经济方面，双方打算在能源、运输、采矿、旅游、卫生以及农业等领域发展合作关系，并准备大力兴办合资企业。在贸易往来上，协议列举了一系列工业产品和农业产品可享受宽厚的关税条件，并且规定，从现在起至1995年，将逐步取消对彼此进出口产品的绝大部分数量限制。
    欧共体已经和捷克斯洛伐克与匈牙利分别签订了经贸合作协议，与苏联的类似协议也在商谈之中，与保加利亚的谈判也已开始。在西方7国首脑会议后，欧共体和苏联东欧的经济关系正急剧发展。
