The All-China Youth Federation's Standing Committee recently made a decision to revoke Shen Jiaqi's position as a Standing Committee member of the All-China Youth Federation.

The decision states that, based on the confirmation by relevant authorities, Shen Jiaqi was identified as the "leader of the illegal organization 'Academic Federation,' and a mastermind behind the turmoil." The Chairman's Meeting of the All-China Youth Federation proposed on June 26 to revoke Shen Jiaqi's position as a Standing Committee member. Following the democratic procedures stipulated in the Youth Federation's charter, the Standing Committee recently adopted a method of mail-in voting by all members to expel Shen Jiaqi from the Youth Federation and revoke his position as a Standing Committee member.
