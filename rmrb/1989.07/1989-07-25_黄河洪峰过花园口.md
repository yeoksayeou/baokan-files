The flood peak of the Yellow River this year, carrying a large amount of silt from the Loess Plateau, safely passed through the first hydrological station in the lower reaches of the Yellow River—Huayuankou in Zhengzhou—at around 10 a.m. today, with a flow rate of 5,800 cubic meters per second. This flood primarily originated from the northern main stream of the Yellow River in the Loess Plateau.

Due to sedimentation, the current flow rate of 5,800 cubic meters per second in the Yellow River is equivalent to the flow rate of 11,600 cubic meters per second in the 1950s.

    黄河洪峰过花园口
    新华社郑州7月25日电　（记者武成德）今日10时许，今年黄河首次洪峰带着黄土高原大量泥沙，以每秒5800立方米流量安全通过黄河下游第一个水文站——郑州花园口。这场洪水主要来自黄河北干流黄土高原。
    由于淤积，现在黄河每秒5800立方米流量，相当于50年代的每秒11600立方米流量。
