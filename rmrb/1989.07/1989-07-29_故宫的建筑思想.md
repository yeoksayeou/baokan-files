The Forbidden City is vast. First and foremost, it is a venue for ceremonial activities.

The architectural design of the Forbidden City pays little attention to modern considerations such as practicality, landscaping, or the use of curves. Everything is designed to achieve the best possible ceremonial effect. The Forbidden City deliberately creates a sense of grandeur through the contrast and transformation of spaces. Upon entering the Meridian Gate, one encounters the narrow, elongated space of the Thousand Steps Corridor. Then, a broad, horizontal expanse opens up, with the towering Gate of Heavenly Peace standing majestically in the center, creating a strong contrast. The white marble bridges, stone pillars, and stone lions in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace vividly contrast with the dark red base of the gate tower, forming the first awe-inspiring climax. Passing through the Gate of Heavenly Peace and the Gate of Supreme Harmony, one enters a deep, enclosed space. At the far end stands the imposing and expansive Meridian Gate, creating a controlled, overpowering, and enclosed space with a strong sense of solemnity and oppression, forming the second climax. Passing through the Gate of Supreme Harmony into the Hall of Supreme Harmony courtyard, one is immediately struck by its grandeur and majesty. Directly ahead stands the towering and awe-inspiring Hall of Supreme Harmony, forming the third climax. In this solemn, climactic atmosphere, who would dare harbor any disloyal thoughts towards the emperor?

The vast courtyards and the grand three-hall complexes, each elevated on a white marble base, are designed to fully immerse the viewer in a specific state. The construction deeply understands the essence of ceremonial culture and the core principles of our own culture, reflecting both the extraordinary wisdom of the Chinese people and their unconditional submission to the emperor.

    故宫的建筑思想
    故宫是博大的，它首先是一个举行礼仪的场所。
    故宫的建筑设计，很少考虑现代建筑中诸如实用效果、广场绿化、曲线变化等，一切为了使礼仪达到最佳效果。故宫刻意制造了在空间对比变换中产生的意境——崇高感。进入大明门，是狭长的千步廊空间，之后，出现一处横向展开的广场，迎面矗立着高大的天安门城楼，对比效果极强。天安门前汉白玉金水河桥和华表、石狮等，鲜明地衬出暗红色的门楼基座，形成第一个让人折服的高潮。进入天安门，过端门，呈现一个纵深而封闭的空间，尽端是雄伟宽大的午门高墙以形成控制、俯视的封闭的空间，有极强的肃杀压抑气氛，构成第二个高潮。经太和门入太和殿前广场，顿感威武壮丽，正前方巍峨崇高、凌驾一切的太和殿，形成第三个高潮。在这肃穆的、高潮迭起的氛围中，谁敢对皇帝心怀二意？
    故宫宽阔的广场，高大的三出阶白玉须弥座托起的三大殿，它的设计使它完全进入特定的状态。它的建构深刻地领悟了礼仪文明的精髓，领悟了我们自身文化的纲领与核心，既表现了中国人非凡的智慧，也体现了对天子无条件的顺从。
