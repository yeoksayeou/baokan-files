In the first half of this year, the staff and workers of the Petrochemical Corporation have, under the difficult conditions of insufficient funds and raw materials and tight transportation, demonstrated the sense of responsibility of the working class as masters of the country and the enterprise spirit of "Love China, Revitalize Petrochemicals." They have steadfastly remained at their posts. From January to June, a total industrial output value of 20.65 billion yuan was completed, accounting for 57% of the annual plan, a 7.6% increase over the same period last year. Despite the significant increase in cost-reducing and profit-reducing factors due to the price increase of one ton of flat-priced crude oil, a profit and tax of 2.8 billion yuan was realized, completing 53% of the annual plan.
