Since ancient times, the practice of qigong in the Buddhist, Taoist, Confucian, and medical traditions has been aimed at cultivating life, which means self-healing, disease prevention, physical fitness, mental enhancement, and longevity. To cultivate life, one must cultivate qi. The methods of cultivating qi have two aspects: one is conservation (conserving the consumption of qi), and the other is augmentation (increasing the production of qi). Both conservation and augmentation must achieve "mental stillness." "Mental stillness" is the fundamental method of cultivating qi. Therefore, all qigong traditions regard "stillness" as the core of their methods. Once this core content is abandoned, the nature of the method changes, becoming akin to martial arts, calisthenics, or dance. Some people use mental activity to pursue extraordinary phenomena such as psychic abilities, external qi emission, and mental telekinesis. These are completely contrary to the qigong training methods and are taboo "distractions" and "deviations" in qigong, not meeting the requirements of qi cultivation and failing to achieve the goal of life cultivation. Although they are also practiced, they fundamentally differ from qigong cultivation. In qigong terms, they are "misguided side paths." Take the emission of external qi, for example. A person who knows nothing about qigong can be taught to perform a few minutes of "opening and closing qi exercises" and immediately emit their internal qi to perform for others. Psychic abilities are similar; children as young as 13 or 14 who know nothing about qigong can also read with their ears or see through the human body. Animals also have psychic abilities. Recently, the U.S. Navy has successfully trained dolphins to launch torpedoes at enemy submarines. From this, it is clear that calling people who possess psychic abilities or can emit external qi "qigong masters," or even "advanced qigong masters," is a big misunderstanding.

In the current qigong craze, many people confuse external skills with qigong, labeling various therapeutic methods as "qigong," such as "qigong massage," "qigong acupressure," and so on. The variety of names makes it difficult to distinguish what is true qigong. Therefore, it is urgent for qigong enthusiasts to rectify the name of qigong.

    应为气功正名
    自古以来，释、道、儒、医各派气功的修练都是以养生为目的，也就是自我治病、防病、健身、益智和延寿。养生必须养气，而养气之法又有两个方面：一是节流（节约气的消耗），二是开源（增加气的生产）。节流和开源都必须做到“意静”，“意静”是养气的根本方法。故各派气功都把“静”作为功法的核心，一旦离开这个核心内容，功法的性质就变了，就像是拳术、体操、舞蹈等。一些人以意识活动去追求特异现象的异能、外气发功、意念搬运等，这些完全与气功修练方法相违背，也是气功所禁忌的“杂念”、“偏差”之类，不符合气功养气的要求，达不到养生的目的。虽然它们也是练出来的，但是它们的练与修持气功是有根本的区别，用气功的话说它们是误入“傍门左道”。拿发放外气来说，一个不懂气功的人，只教他做几分钟的“开合运气”，就能马上把其内气引发出来，为别人发功。特异功能也是这样，不懂气功的十三四岁少年儿童也能耳朵识字、透视人体等。动物也有特异功能，最近美国海军已成功地训练海豚去向敌方潜艇放鱼雷。由此可见，把具有特异功能和会发外气的人称之为气功师，甚至高级气功师，是个很大的误会。
    在当今的气功热潮中，许多人把一些属于外功的东西都当作了气功，给不少治病方法戴上了“气功”的帽子，挂起了“医疗气功”的招牌。如搞推拿的叫“气功推拿”，搞按摩的叫“气功按摩点穴”等等，名目之多，真叫人无法分清什么是真正的气功，这就迫切需要广大气功爱好者为其正名。
