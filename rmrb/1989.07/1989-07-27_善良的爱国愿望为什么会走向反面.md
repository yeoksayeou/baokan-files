In this political turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, a considerable number of students were, to varying degrees, drawn into the student movement and the turmoil. Many students, although aware that some of their extreme actions were irrational and illegal, believed that their motives and wishes were benevolent and patriotic. The phrase "patriotism is not a crime" is a self-description of this psychological state.

Indeed, at the beginning of the student movement, many students, out of patriotic sentiments, raised some reasonable suggestions regarding deepening reforms, punishing corrupt officials, and opposing corruption. This reflected the broad concern of young students for the future of the country and the nation, as well as their sense of participation. Central leaders have repeatedly given full affirmation to this point and believe that, in this regard, the goals of the students are consistent with those of the Party and the government.

In this student movement and the subsequent development of events, why did the patriotic wishes of many students not develop in a positive direction but instead escalate into political turmoil and ultimately a counter-revolutionary rebellion? From the perspective of the students themselves, the fundamental reason lies in the fact that they did not understand and practice their patriotism from a socialist perspective. Their benevolent patriotic wishes, following the objective logic of political struggle, turned into their opposite. This is indeed worth our calm reflection.

A reactionary political program is the primary reason for the students' patriotic wishes turning into their opposite.

Materialist historiography tells us that every major historical event and every serious political struggle has its inherent objective logic. It does not depend on the subjective wishes of the masses but is primarily determined by the program that occupies the guiding position.

Everyone knows that this political turmoil began with the mourning of Hu Yaobang's death. From April 15, the mourning activities, once they began, carried a strong political color and many abnormal situations. Under the instigation of Li Shuxian and others, in the early hours of April 18, Wang Dan and others gave a speech at the Monument to the People's Heroes, proposing the "six political demands." Soon, these six demands evolved into the "seven political demands" presented to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and the State Council. Around April 18, in universities such as Beijing University, Renmin University, Beijing Normal University, and Tsinghua University, similar content and programmatic nature big-character posters were also posted. In these programs, the common and core political demands were: "Completely negate the 'cleansing of spiritual pollution' and 'opposing bourgeois liberalization,' and rehabilitate the citizens who suffered in them." Some specifically mentioned "rehabilitating Fang Lizhi and Liu Binyang." Some also proposed to "abolish the term 'bourgeois liberalization'" and "rehabilitate liberalization." At the same time, some proposed specific demands, saying that China should implement "privatization" in the economy, and issued the "Declaration of Private Ownership"; in politics, it should implement Western-style "multi-party system" and "parliamentary system"; in ideology and culture, it should achieve "pluralism," advocate absolute "press freedom" and "private newspapers," and so on.

Obviously, this is a complete reactionary political program of a bourgeois nature that takes "rehabilitating bourgeois liberalization" as a "breakthrough." It is well known that "bourgeois liberalization" has a definite content. That is, to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, advocate "complete Westernization," and implement a capitalist system. As for the statements in this program such as "opposing corruption and punishing corrupt officials" and "increasing educational funding and improving the treatment of intellectuals," they are merely accompaniments and tactical means. Wang Dan clearly said: their "minimum goal" was "to recognize the legality of 'High Autonomous Federation,' rehabilitate Fang Lizhi, and allow private newspapers"; their "maximum goal" was "to establish a 'multi-party system' and achieve 'elite politics.'" As for "opposing corruption," he said it was a "minor matter." Another leader of "High Autonomous Federation" said more clearly, "opposing corruption and opposing official profiteering is a means to mobilize the masses. We will also engage in official profiteering when we come to power, the problem is that China cannot implement public ownership, it must implement private ownership."

Such blatant remarks show that their political program reflects not the patriotic wishes of the broad masses of students but the reactionary political stance of those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization. In recent years, Fang Lizhi has opposed the Four Cardinal Principles, advocated for "complete Westernization" in China, that is, capitalization. He said without restraint: "The Four Cardinal Principles are nothing to be afraid of," socialism in "every country has failed, the result is wrong, ... the fundamental principle is wrong," "the way out for the mainland is capitalization," "only by reforming the ownership to private ownership can it be fundamentally solved." He slandered "the Communist Party is black," "it is necessary to join the opposition party"; he also attacked, "the three parts of Marxism are all outdated, and wrong," "it is necessary to thoroughly criticize Mao Zedong Thought to reform," and so on. People can imagine that a political program formulated according to Fang Lizhi's reactionary thoughts can guide the broad masses of students to the track of a "patriotic democratic movement"? On the contrary, it can only lead the student movement to the track of anti-party and anti-socialism.

In actual actions, the planners and organizers of the turmoil, according to their predetermined program, continuously escalated the turmoil. Especially after May 4, they believed they had the public support of Zhao Ziyang, who was then the General Secretary of the Party, and thus became even more audacious in inciting some people to propose reactionary slogans to overthrow the Party and state leaders, especially directing the spearhead at Comrades Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng. What is intolerable is that some people then went so far as to publicly slander the Chinese government, which was formed according to the law, as a "fake government" and "reactionary government," and issued a chorus of reactionary calls to "overthrow the government" and "burn Zhongnanhai." Finally, under the guidance of this reactionary political program, a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion was brewed in the capital.

An important reason why the patriotic wishes of the broad masses of students turned into their opposite is that a small number of people who manipulated and controlled them insisted on national nihilism and treason.

Now, more and more evidence shows that a small number of conspirators and "elite" are the true proposers and formulators of the political program that dominated this political turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. And as the ideological basis of this, it is national nihilism and treason characterized by the worship of bourgeois civilization.

As the "mentor" of Wang Dan and others in making the turmoil and rebellion, Fang Lizhi is a typical representative of national nihilism and a fervent propagandist of treacherous "Hanjian" thoughts. Fang Lizhi, in the October issue of the Hong Kong magazines "Nineties" and "Contention," spoke at length, denigrating and ridiculing Chinese culture. He claimed that if Chinese culture could not keep up with the "world trend" of capitalism, it would be fine to let it "completely perish." He used the "Two River Civilization" and "Maya Civilization" as examples to assert that Chinese culture would also be "eliminated by the times" and become a "dead culture." He even shouted to "dissolve" China so that he could become a so-called "world citizen." Fang Lizhi's words are indeed unbearable. Another self-proclaimed "black hand" reactionary madman, Liu Xiaobo, in recent years, in his writings and speeches, cursed everything about China's history and reality, completely negating it. He even said, "the Chinese race is no good," "I don't care about patriotism or treason, if you say I am treasonous, I will be treasonous! I admit that I am an unfilial son who digs up ancestors' graves, and I am proud of it." Political activities guided by such people, of course, could not possibly be a "patriotic democratic movement."

The television series "Heshang," which some people regard as a treasure, is another typical example of promoting national nihilism, enthusiastically singing the praises of capitalist "blue civilization," and opening the way for bourgeois liberalization. The authors of "Heshang" are also those who gained fame by cursing China's history and reality. They racked their brains to curse their own motherland, saying that the Chinese people were born in the yellow earth, grew up in the yellow earth, had yellow faces, ate yellow rice, drank yellow water, and lived in yellow earth caves, and that everything was no good. They talked nonsense about how the "civilization of the yellow race" had declined and the Yellow River could not "give birth to new civilization." In their eyes, it seemed that China did not even deserve the right to exist on Earth. On the contrary, they tried their best to beautify the imperialist invasion, plunder, and trampling of China since modern times. They slandered China's history of resisting invasion since 1840, especially the land revolution war, the war of resistance against Japan, and the war of liberation led by the Communist Party of China, as "turmoil." They talked nonsense about how foreign powers opened China's doors with gunboats, bringing "blue civilization," and the victory of "yellow civilization." They believed that today, only "complete Westernization" and taking the "blue civilization" road, that is, the capitalist road, is the only way out for China.

The facts show that in this turmoil and rebellion, some people who played the role of behind-the-scenes directors, as well as the organizers and commanders, not only accepted a large amount of financial "assistance" from international reactionary forces but also had close ties and colluded with each other. We can imagine that a "student movement" manipulated and utilized by such a group of people who harbor treason in their bones and collude with Western reactionary forces in their actions would not turn into the opposite of patriotism?

The patriotic wishes of the broad masses of young students were utilized and turned into their opposite through their own weaknesses.

In the broad masses of students, patriotic wishes and political naivety coexist, patriotic enthusiasm and emotional extremism coexist. In recent years, the tide of bourgeois liberalization has surged, and the discourse of advocating capitalism and denigrating socialism has been unending, thus forming an extremely abnormal atmosphere of thought and public opinion. Some bourgeois ideas, such as abstract democracy, freedom, and human rights concepts, have infiltrated the souls of young students through various channels, poisoning them to varying degrees. In recent years, ideological and political work has also been significantly weakened, and the education of Marxist basic theories has been relaxed. In addition, while the reform and opening up have achieved remarkable results, there have also been some mistakes. This has exacerbated some social problems, such as economic overheating, rapid price increases, obvious inflation, unfair social distribution, official profiteering, and corruption, which have formed various discontent in society and also influenced young students. Therefore, some students have lost trust in the Party, their faith in Marxism-Leninism and the socialist system has wavered, and they are pessimistic and desperate about the future of the country and the fate of the nation, always wanting to find some panacea to cure social ills outside of socialism.

Under this spiritual state, many people find the discourse of bourgeois liberalization easy to listen to and easy to say, without deep investigation. A few people naively believe that no matter what "ism," no matter what "ownership system," as long as it can accelerate the country's economic development and quickly change the country's poor and backward appearance, it is worth a try. Their political immaturity makes them easily deceived and, unwittingly and to varying degrees, drawn into the student movement. In addition, a small number of people with ulterior motives created and spread various political rumors, making many students follow like sheep, and a few people did things that made their loved ones sad and their enemies happy, even paying the price in blood, and still thought it was a so-called "patriotic" behavior. This cannot be said to be a tragedy.

The broad masses of young students did not consider the unity of patriotic motives and effects, the unity of purposes and means, resulting in the opposite of their wishes.

Everyone knows that a person with only benevolent motives and wishes cannot produce any actual results. Benevolent motives and wishes can only be realized through correct means and actions, achieving the unity of motives and effects, the unity of purposes and means.

In this student movement and its subsequent development, the actions of the students were diametrically opposed to their subjective patriotic wishes. For the broad masses of students, there was a desire to promote democratic and legal system construction, but they adopted anti-democratic and anti-legal means to fight for it. Some of them themselves went on strike but deprived others of the freedom to attend classes; they ignored laws and regulations and went on marches whenever they wanted, set up roadblocks to obstruct traffic, and disregarded the disruption of social order; they acted recklessly, stormed central leadership agencies and key departments several times, illegally set up checkpoints, intercepted and inspected passing vehicles and pedestrians; they acted lawlessly, occupied schools' broadcasting stations for a long time, set up loudspeakers, and used them to spread rumors and conduct incitement propaganda; more seriously, a few students, disregarding the martial law order issued by the State Council, participated in the seizure of public vehicles, set up roadblocks, obstructed martial law troops, burned and smashed military and civilian vehicles, seized guns and other military supplies, and so on. All these extremely anarchist and even criminal behaviors themselves, violently trampled on socialist democracy and the legal system. Using such behavior that only emphasizes wishes and motives, without considering social effects, to promote so-called democratic and legal system construction, is like trying to catch fish by climbing a tree!

In summary, the political turmoil that started with the student movement and escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing was not accidental. The patriotic wishes of the broad masses of young students turned into their opposite under the guidance of a reactionary political program, under the erosion of bourgeois liberalization with national nihilism as the keynote, and also under the condition that the students insisted on their personal one-sided wishes without considering the social effects of their behavior and were utilized by conspirators. This profound and even bloody lesson tells us that a true patriot must elevate his or her simple patriotic feelings to the level of socialism and concretely embody them in his or her actions to produce good results.

    善良的爱国愿望为什么会走向反面
    李征
    在这次政治动乱和反革命暴乱中，有相当一部分青年学生不同程度地被卷入学潮和动乱。很多同学虽然也知道自己的一些过激言行，是缺乏理智的、违法的，但是，他们自认为动机、愿望是善良的、爱国的。所谓“爱国无罪”云云，就是这种心理状态的自我描述。
    诚然，在学潮伊始，广大同学出于爱国的愿望，提出深化改革，惩治官倒，反对腐败等方面的一些合理意见，是难能可贵的。这体现了广大青年学生关注国家和民族前途的忧患意识与参与感。对此，中央领导同志多次予以充分肯定。并认为，在这点上，与党和政府的目标是一致的。
    在这次学潮及其后的事态演变中，为什么广大同学的爱国愿望，并没有向积极方面发展，而是演变成政治动乱，直至反革命暴乱呢？从广大学生自身说来，其根本原因，就在于他们不是从社会主义高度，来理解和实践自己的爱国主义。他们善良的爱国愿望，按照政治斗争的客观逻辑，走向了自己的反面。这的确值得我们冷静地加以反思。
      有一个反动政治纲领的导向，是广大同学的爱国愿
  望走向反面的首要原因
    唯物史观告诉我们，每一个重大的历史事件，每一场严重政治斗争的性质和演变，都有其固有的客观逻辑。它不取决于广大群众单纯个人的主观愿望，而首先是由其中居于指导地位的纲领决定的。
    大家知道，这次政治风波是借悼念胡耀邦同志逝世肇始的。从4月15日开始的悼念活动，一经出现就带有浓厚的政治色彩和许多反常的情形。在李淑娴等人的指使下，4月18日凌晨，王丹等人在人民英雄纪念碑前的讲演中，就提出了“六条”政治要求。稍后，这六条纲领又演变成向人大常委会、中共中央和国务院几次请愿的“七条”政治要求。在4月18日前后几天中，在北京大学、人民大学、北京师范大学、清华大学等高校，也有人贴出了内容大体相同、带有纲领性质的大字报。在这些纲领中，共同的和核心的政治要求就是一条：“彻底否定‘清除精神污染’和‘反对资产阶级自由化’，为在其中受害的公民平反”，有的点名要
  “为方励之、刘宾雁平反”。有的还提出要“取消资产阶级自由化的提法”，“为自由化正名”。与此同时，有人提出具体要求，说中国在经济上要搞“私有化”，发表了《私有制宣言》；在政治上，要搞西方式的“多党制”和“议会制”；在思想文化上，要实现“多元化”，提倡绝对的“新闻自由”和“私人办报”，等等。
    显然，这是一个以为“资产阶级自由化”平反作为“突破口”的、完整的资产阶级性质的反动政治纲领。尽人皆知，“资产阶级自由化”是有其确定内容的。这就是，否定共产党的领导和社会主义制度，主张
  “全盘西化”，实行资本主义制度。至于这个纲领中有时提到的“反对腐败，惩治官倒”，“增加教育经费，提高知识分子待遇”等说法，只是个陪衬和策略手段。王丹明确地说：他们闹事的“最低目标”是，“承认‘高自联’合法，给方励之平反，民间办报”；“最高目标”是：“建立‘多元政体’，实现‘精英政治’”。至于“反官倒”，他说是“小事”。而“高自联”的另一个头头说得更明确，反腐败、反官倒“是发动群众的手段，我们上台也是要搞官倒的，问题是中国不能搞公有制，必须搞私有制”。
    这种露骨的言论表明，他们的政治纲领所反映的，根本不是广大学生的爱国愿望，而是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的反动政治主张。近几年来，方励之反对四项基本原则，鼓吹在中国实行“全盘西化”即资本主义化，他肆无忌惮地说：“四个坚持没有什么可怕”，社会主义在“每一个国家都不成功，结果都是错误的，……根本原则是错误的”，“大陆的出路就是资本主义化”，“唯有改革所有制为私有制方是根本办法”。他诬蔑“共产党是黑的”，“需要加入反对党”；他还攻击说，“马克思主义三个部分均已过时，而且错误”，“一定要彻底批判毛泽东思想才能改革”，等等。人们可以想一想，按照方励之的这类反动思想炮制出的政治纲领，能够把广大同学的善良愿望，引导到“爱国民主运动”的轨道吗？恰恰相反，它只能把学潮导向反党反社会主义的轨道。
    在实际行动上，动乱的策划者和组织者按照其既定纲领，不断地把动乱引向升级。特别是在“五四”之后，他们认为有作为当时党的总书记赵紫阳同志的公开支持，便更加有恃无恐地策动一些人提出打倒党和国家领导人的反动口号，尤其是把矛头集中地指向邓小平同志和李鹏同志。令人不能容忍的是，此后少数人竟丧心病狂地公开诬蔑依法产生的中国政府是“伪政府”、“反动政府”，发出了一片“打倒政府”、“推翻政府”，要“火烧中南海”的反动叫嚣。最后，在这个反动政治纲领的导向下，终于在首都酿成了一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。
      广大学生的爱国愿望走向反面的一个重要原
  因，就在于操纵和控制他们的极少数人坚持民族
  虚无主义和卖国主义
    现在有越来越多的事实证明，极少数阴谋分子和“精英”分子，是支配这次政治动乱和反革命暴乱的政治纲领的真正提出者和制订者。而作为其思想基础的，就是以崇拜资产阶级文明为特征的民族虚无主义和卖国主义。
    作为王丹等人搞动乱和暴乱之“导师”方励之，就是民族虚无主义的典型代表，是卖国的“汉奸思想”的狂热吹鼓手。方励之在去年10月号香港《九十年代》和《争鸣》杂志上大放厥词，极力贬低和讥咒中国文化。他声称，如果中国文化跟不上资本主义的“世界潮流”，就让它“彻底湮灭”也没有什么了不起。他以“两河文化”和“玛雅文化”为例，断言中国文化也将像它们一样“被时代淘汰”，而成为“亡文化”。他甚至叫嚷要“解散”中国，好让他去当所谓“世界公民”。方励之的这一番妙论，的确不堪入耳。另一个以“黑手”自居的反动狂人刘晓波，近年来，在他撰写的文章和讲演中，把中国历史和现实的一切，统统骂遍，全盘否定。他甚至说“中国的人种”就不行，“我无所谓爱国、叛国，你要说我叛国，我就叛国！就承认自己是挖祖坟的不孝子孙，且以此为荣。”由这样的人插手，甚至按照他们提出的纲领来“指导”的政治活动，当然也绝不可能是什么
  “爱国民主运动”了。
    被某些人奉为至宝的电视片《河殇》，是宣扬民族虚无主义，狂热讴歌资本主义“蓝色文明”，并为资产阶级自由化鸣锣开道的又一典型。《河殇》的作者，也是以骂遍中国历史和现实而出尽风头的所谓“精英”。他们挖空心思，咒骂自己的祖国，说中国人生于黄土，长于黄土，黄面孔，吃黄米，喝黄水，住黄土窑洞，什么都不行。胡说什么“黄种人的文明”衰落了，黄河“孕育不了新的文明”。在这些人眼中，似乎中国连在地球上生存的权利也不配有。相反，他们却竭力美化帝国主义近代以来对中国的侵略、掠夺和蹂躏。他们把从1840年以来的中国反侵略的历史，特别是在中国共产党领导下的土地革命战争、抗日战争和解放战争，诬蔑成“动乱”。胡说外国列强用炮舰打开中国的大门，是带来了“蓝色文明”，是对“黄色文明”的胜利。他们认为在今天，只有“全盘西化”，走“蓝色文明”即资本主义道路，才是中国的唯一出路。
    事实表明，在这次动乱和暴乱中扮演幕后导演角色的一些人，以及它的组织者和指挥者，同国际反动势力，不仅接受大量的金钱“资助”，而且过从甚密，相互勾结。我们可以想一想，由这样一批骨子里怀着卖国主义，在行动上又与西方反动势力暗中勾结的人们所操纵和利用的“学生运动”，能不走向爱国主义的反面吗？
      广大青年学生的爱国愿望被人利用而走向反
  面，是通过同学们自身的弱点起作用的
    在广大同学身上，爱国的愿望与政治上的天真幼稚同在，爱国的热情与情绪上偏激并存。这些年来，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，宣扬资本主义、贬低社会主义的论调不绝于耳，由此形成了一种极不正常的思想和舆论氛围。一些资产阶级的思想意识，如抽象的民主、自由和人权观念，从各种渠道侵蚀着青年学生的灵魂，使他们程度不同地受到毒害。这几年来，思想政治工作也大大减弱了，马克思主义基本理论的教育也放松了，再加上改革开放在取得了显著成就的同时，也有一些失误，由此加剧的一些社会问题，如经济过热，物价上涨过猛，通货膨胀明显，社会分配不公，官倒和腐败现象等等，在社会上形成种种不满情绪，也影响着青年学生。因而，有一部分学生对党不信任，对马列主义和社会主义制度的信念发生动摇，对国家的前途、民族的命运悲观失望，总想从社会主义之外，去寻找某种医治社会积弊的灵丹妙药。
    在这种精神状态下，不少人对资产阶级自由化的那一套论调，听起来顺耳，说起来顺嘴，而不加深究。有少数人天真地认为，不管什么“主义”，不管什么“所有制”，只要能加快国家经济的发展，能较快改变国家的贫穷、后进的面貌，就值得一试。他们政治上的这种不成熟性，使他们容易上当受骗，而不知不觉地和不同程度地被卷入学潮。加之，极少数别有用心的人制造和散播了种种政治谣言，使得很多学生被牵着鼻子走，有极少数人干出了使亲者痛、仇者快的事来，甚至付出了血的代价，还自认为是所谓“爱国”的行为。这不能不说是一场悲剧。
      广大青年学生没有顾及爱国的动机与效果的
  统一、目的与手段的统一，其结果事与愿违
    谁都知道，一个人单有善良的动机和愿望，并不能产生任何实际的结果。善良的动机和愿望，只有通过正确的手段和行动，才能变成现实，达到动机同效果的统一、目的同手段的统一。
    在这次学潮及其后的演变中，同学们的行动与其爱国的主观愿望是背道而驰的。就广大同学而言，有推进民主和法制建设的愿望，却采取反民主和反法制的手段来争取。他们有些人自己罢课，却剥夺别人上课的自由；他们无视法纪，想游行就游行，设路障阻塞交通，置破坏社会秩序于不顾；他们恣意妄为，数次冲击中央领导机关和要害部门，非法设立哨卡，拦截和检查过往车辆和行人；他们无法无天，长期占驻天安门广场，把神圣的广场糟踏得脏乱不堪，使之成为制造动乱的策源地；他们毫无法制观念，擅自抢占学校广播台，架设高音喇叭，用以传播谣言，进行煽动性宣传；更为严重的是，还有少数学生，无视国务院发布的戒严令，参与抢夺公共车辆，设置路障，拦阻戒严部队，烧砸军车和民用车辆，抢夺枪支和其他军用物资，如此等等。所有这些极端无政府主义的、甚至是犯罪的行为本身，粗暴地践踏了社会主义民主和法制。用这样只强调愿望、动机，而丝毫不顾及社会效果的行为，来推进所谓的民主和法制建设，无异于缘木求鱼！
    综上所述，这次由学潮为发端的政治动乱，在北京演变成反革命暴乱，决不是偶然的。广大青年学生的爱国愿望之所以走向了反面，是在反动政治纲领的导向下，在以卖国主义为基调的资产阶级自由化思潮的腐蚀下，也是在同学们固执于个人的一厢情愿而不顾及行为的社会效果并被阴谋分子所利用的情况下，一步一步地酿成的。这个深刻的、甚至是血的教训告诉我们，一个真正的爱国主义者，必须使自己朴素的爱国主义情感上升到社会主义的高度，并且要具体地体现在自己的行动中，才能产生好的效果。
