The world's nuclear power plants have reached a total of 429, according to a report in the July issue of the magazine "Atom." The International Atomic Energy Agency's figures show that by the end of last year, there were 429 operational nuclear reactors worldwide, distributed across 26 countries and regions, with a total installed capacity of approximately 310,000 megawatts. Nuclear power generation accounts for 17% of the world's total electricity output.

The seven countries with the most nuclear power plants are: the United States with 108 reactors, an installed capacity of 95,273 megawatts; France with 55 reactors, 52,588 megawatts; the Soviet Union with 56 reactors, 33,823 megawatts; Japan with 38 reactors, 28,253 megawatts; West Germany with 23 reactors, 21,491 megawatts; Canada with 18 reactors, 12,185 megawatts; and the United Kingdom with 40 reactors, 11,921 megawatts.

The proportion of nuclear power generation to the total electricity output in these seven countries is as follows: France 69.9%, West Germany 34%, Japan 23.4%, the United States 19.5%, the United Kingdom 19.3%, Canada 16%, and the Soviet Union 12.6%.

There are currently 105 nuclear reactors under construction worldwide, with a total installed capacity of 84,871 megawatts.

China is constructing 3 nuclear reactors with an installed capacity of 2,148 megawatts.
