By June 30, Daqing Oilfield had cumulatively produced 27.5861 million tons of crude oil, exceeding the first half-year production target by 1.1 million tons.

This year marks the 14th consecutive year of steady production for Daqing Oilfield. The 200,000 workers of Daqing, prioritizing the national interest, have persevered in their spirit of hard work and self-reliance. They have overcome difficulties such as funding shortages, power shortages, rising raw material prices, and a significant increase in surface engineering projects in the oilfield. This has allowed exploration, drilling, oil extraction, and oil construction to progress simultaneously, leading to a thriving production landscape. It is understood that the production of natural gas and light hydrocarbons has also fully met the production plan.
