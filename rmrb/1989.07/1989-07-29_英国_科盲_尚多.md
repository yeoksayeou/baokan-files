Britain is a highly developed industrial nation with advanced science and technology. However, it is rather ironic that a survey conducted by Dr. John Durant of the London Science Museum in recent years has shown that there are still "quite a few" science illiterates in Britain.

The survey began in June 1988. Durant surveyed over 2,000 men and women from various political and economic backgrounds, educational levels, ethnicities, and religious beliefs, through oral or written questionnaires. The first item in the survey was, "Are you interested in science?" The results showed that although 50% and 40% of the respondents expressed interest in new discoveries in the medical field and practical new inventions, respectively, only one-third of them had a basic understanding of the trends in these fields. The remaining two-thirds were completely unaware. The second item was a test on basic scientific knowledge. The results showed that only 60% of the respondents knew that the Earth orbits the Sun, and only 30% knew that it takes one year for the Earth to complete one orbit around the Sun. Approximately three-quarters of the respondents did not know how the concept of "months" originated. About one-third of the respondents believed that humans existed during the dinosaur era. Most British people are also unaware of modern scientific and technological products and theories. For example, about half of the respondents mistakenly believed that nuclear power plants can cause acid rain, and more than half could not explain what the "greenhouse effect" is. Additionally, the "hands-on" skills of contemporary British people seem to be inferior to those of the previous generation—about two-thirds of the respondents could not even install a regular light bulb.

The publication of this survey has caused concern among many enlightened British citizens. They believe that the world has entered the space age and the computer age, and British citizens should enrich their minds with modern scientific knowledge!

    英国“科盲”尚多
    胡长风
    英国是个科学技术相当发达的工业国家，然而颇富讽刺意味的是，伦敦科学博物馆的约翰·杜兰特博士近年来进行的一项专题调查却显示：英国的“科盲”还
  “相当多”。
    此项调查始于一九八八年六月。调查中杜兰特曾对二千余名不同政治及经济背景、不同文化程度、不同民族及宗教信仰的男女公民作了口头或书面征答。调查第一项是“您是否对科学感兴趣”，结果是：虽然有百分之五十和百分之四十的接受调查者分别表示对医学界的新发现和实用新发明“感兴趣”，但实际上其中只有三分之一的对这些领域的发展趋势“略知一二”，而其余三分之二完全属“一问三不知”。调查第二项为“最基本科普知识”测试，结果是：只有百分之六十的被调查者知道地球是绕着太阳转的，只有百分之三十的被调查者知道地球绕太阳转一圈的时间是一年，约有四分之三的被调查者不知道“月份”是怎么来的；约有三分之一的被调查者以为恐龙时期便出现了人类；对现代科技的新产物和新理论，大多数英国人也“一窍不通”，如约有一半的被调查者误以为核电站也会导致酸雨的产生，有一半以上的被调查者说不清“温室效应”为何物；此外，英国当代人的“动手”能力似乎也比不上上一代人——约有三分之二的被调查者竟不会安装普通电灯……
    此项调查的公布使不少英国有识之士产生忧虑。他们认为，世界已步入太空时代和电脑时代，英国公民应该用现代科学知识来充实头脑了！
