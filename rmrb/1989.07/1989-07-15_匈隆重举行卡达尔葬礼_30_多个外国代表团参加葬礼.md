Hungary Holds Grand Funeral for Kadar
More Than 30 Foreign Delegations Attend the Funeral

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, July 14 - (Reporter Zou Guochang) The Hungarian Party and government held a grand funeral for former leader Kadar Janos today.

At the burial ceremony held at the Mezsö Cemetery in Budapest, where famous figures are buried, Party and government leaders, as well as representatives from mass organizations, attended the funeral and took turns to guard the body. More than 30 foreign delegations also participated in the funeral.

Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Chairman Nersh, in his farewell speech, praised Kadar as an internationally recognized outstanding Hungarian leader. His life was a life of struggle, a life dedicated to the people and the Party's cause.

Before the burial ceremony, to facilitate the public's mourning, a funeral hall was set up in the Party Central Committee building. Over 60,000 people came to pay their respects. Along the route from the Party Central Committee building to the Mezsö Cemetery, many people stood by the roadside to catch a last glimpse of Kadar. After the ceremony, many people still went to Kadar's grave to lay flowers.

Hungarian Party General Secretary Grosz today, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, bid farewell to Kadar, saying: "So many people spontaneously came to bid farewell to Kadar, which is an affirmation of Kadar's work in the past 30 years, a trust in the Hungarian Party's policies, and also a support for socialism."

    匈隆重举行卡达尔葬礼
    30多个外国代表团参加葬礼
    新华社布达佩斯7月14日电  （记者邹国昌）匈牙利党和政府今天为前领导人卡达尔·亚诺什举行了隆重葬礼。
    在布达佩斯埋葬知名人士的梅泽墓地举行的安葬仪式上，匈党政军领导人和群众团体的代表出席了葬礼并轮流为卡达尔守灵。30多个外国代表团也参加了葬礼。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党主席涅尔什在告别讲话中称赞卡达尔是国际公认的杰出的匈牙利领导人。他的一生是战斗的一生，是为人民为党的事业服务的一生。
    在安葬仪式前，为了方便群众吊唁，在党中央大厦设了灵堂，有6万多人前往吊唁。灵车从党中央大厦到梅泽墓地的沿途，有许多群众在路旁伫立，以便能最后看上卡达尔一眼。仪式结束后，仍有不少人到卡达尔的墓前敬献鲜花。
    匈党总书记格罗斯今天代表党中央干部向卡达尔告别时说：“这么多的群众自发向卡达尔告别，是对卡达尔最近30年的肯定，是对匈党政策的信任，也是对社会主义的支持”。
