    Xujishe, Secretary of the Hainan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, emphasized at the third session of the first plenary meeting of the provincial committee held today that efforts must be made to institutionalize the construction of clean governance as a major task, gradually improving the standardization and openness of government departments' management work.

    Xujishe proposed that the following aspects of work should be focused on at present:

    — Thoroughly investigate and handle major cases. Major cases that have been concentrated and investigated in the previous stages of rectifying companies, auditing land, and conducting financial and tax inspections should be handled seriously in accordance with party discipline and state laws. Those corrupt criminals who have aroused extreme public indignation should be severely punished and made public.

    — Increase transparency to facilitate supervision and self-discipline. Starting from the provincial leadership organs, the transparency of organ work should be improved, and institutional regulations should be formulated to constrain leading cadres. Currently, the first step is to publicize the situation of agricultural loans and fertilizer distribution to the masses, and the second step is to clean up and rectify the construction of private houses by cadres in urban areas.

    — Strengthen and improve the supervision mechanism. Strengthen public supervision, establish various channels for the public to report and expose issues, and establish and improve various reporting systems. Strengthen public opinion supervision and strengthen the supervision of specialized agencies.

    — Improve the political quality of party and government cadres and enhance their self-discipline. National and provincial conditions education should be conducted for the majority of party members, and education on diligence, simplicity, hard work, and clean governance should be conducted to strengthen the "servant consciousness" of party members, especially leading cadres, and to serve the people wholeheartedly.

    许士杰在海南省委全会上强调
    廉政建设要制度化
    新华社海口7月17日电　（记者陈江）中共海南省委书记许士杰在今天召开的省委一届三次会议上强调，要下决心把廉政制度建设作为一件大事来抓，逐步提高政府部门管理工作的规范化和公开程度。
    许士杰提出当前要抓好以下几方面的工作：
    ——认真查处大案要案。在前一阶段整顿公司、清查土地、财税大检查中已集中查清的大案要案，要按照党纪国法，严肃处理，严惩那些民愤极大的腐败犯罪分子，并公之于众。
    ——增加工作透明度，以便于监督和自律。要从省领导机关做起，提高机关工作透明度，制定约束领导干部的廉政制度。当前一是把农业贷款和化肥分配情况向群众公布，二是对干部在城镇建私房进行清理整顿。
    ——加强和完善监督机制。加强群众监督，建立各种有利于群众检举揭发，反映意见的渠道，建立健全各种举报制度，加强舆论监督，加强专门机构的监督。
    ——提高党政干部的政治素质，增强自我约束能力。要对广大党员进行国情、省情教育，进行勤劳朴素、艰苦奋斗的教育和廉政教育，使党员、特别是领导干部强化“公仆意识”，全心全意为人民服务。
