A recent bulletin from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) indicates that the global situation for grain production and reserves is unfavorable. The world's grain production in the 1987-1988 period decreased by 61 million tons compared to the previous year. The United States and Canada saw a 30% reduction, the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries saw a 5% reduction to 8 billion tons, and China saw an 880 million ton reduction, the first decrease since surpassing 4 billion tons in 1984. Although the FAO estimates that this year's global grain production may reach 1.889 billion tons, an 8% increase from last year, the overall trend in global grain production remains concerning.

Grain reserves are also declining, expected to drop from 4.5 billion tons in 1987 to 2.87 billion tons in 1989, with a consumption ratio of 16%, below the FAO's minimum safety level of 17%-18% required to ensure global food security. This could potentially lead to the second global food crisis since 1974-1975.

There are many reasons for the poor global grain production situation, but the primary cause is the recent unfavorable weather conditions, with widespread droughts, floods, pests, and storms frequently striking various regions of the Earth. In 1988, 43% of North America's cultivated land suffered from drought, Central America and the Caribbean region were hit by two hurricanes, and Asian countries like Bangladesh and Thailand experienced consecutive floods. Africa's sub-Saharan region, which usually suffers from droughts, was hit by severe floods and locust infestations. At the beginning of this year, drought struck North and South America and Southern Europe. Since December 1, 1988, the rainfall in Southern Europe has been only 25% of the normal amount.

Why has the weather become increasingly unpredictable in recent years? Many scientists attribute this to severe damage to the ecological environment. Many barren mountains and hills around the world are not naturally so but are the result of centuries of human deforestation or war destruction. Currently, the world deforests 200,000 square kilometers annually, leading to desertification covering an area equivalent to Belgium in the Sahel region alone. Soil erosion due to vegetation destruction results in 24 billion tons of topsoil loss annually.

Due to long-term neglect of ecological environment protection, the Earth's climate has undergone significant changes. Each year, countries around the world emit 5.5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, with 4.5 billion tons coming from fossil fuels and 1 billion tons from vehicle emissions. Only half of this carbon dioxide is absorbed by plants and oceans, while the rest accumulates in the atmosphere, creating a "greenhouse effect" that raises temperatures, making water, drought, and wind disasters more frequent, widespread, and severe. Scientists have measured that in the past 100 years, the Earth's temperature has risen by approximately 0.7°C, and in the less than 30 years since 1960, the temperature has risen by 0.3°C. In the next 30 years, the temperature is expected to rise by 1°C-4°C, while the current Earth temperature is only 5°C higher than it was 10,000 years ago. Clearly, the current rate of temperature increase is much faster than in the past. Some scientists warn that when the temperature rises enough to melt the polar ice caps, the sea level will rise by more than 1 meter, potentially submerging countries like the Maldives, Seychelles, and other low-lying islands and coastal regions. Furthermore, if all the carbon on Earth turns into carbon dioxide and accumulates in the atmosphere, the Earth's carbon dioxide concentration could reach that of Venus. Clearly, concerns about "Venus-like Earth" are not unfounded. Venus has a temperature of 450°C.

It is not too late to mend our ways. Before the "greenhouse effect" becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, if the world's billions of people work together, and countries, especially industrialized nations, take concrete measures and persistently protect and improve the ecological environment, the Earth's climate can gradually improve. An improved ecological environment will provide a reliable natural foundation for global grain production. Otherwise, not only will the global grain production problem be difficult to solve, but humanity may also face the dire consequences of "destroying our own home." Clearly, vigorously improving the ecological environment is an urgent task for all of humanity.

    治理生态环境　促进粮食生产
    杨贵兰
    联合国粮农组织最近发表的公报表明，世界的粮食生产和储备形势欠佳。1987—1988年度的世界粮食产量比上一年度减产6100万吨，其中美国、加拿大减产30％；苏联、东欧国家减产5％，减至8亿吨；中国减产880万吨，是1984年突破4亿吨大关以来第一次减产。尽管联合国粮农组织估计今年世界粮食产量可达18.89亿吨，比去年增加8％，但世界粮食生产趋向仍不容乐观。
    粮食储备也呈下降趋势，预计将从1987年的4.5亿吨下降至1989年的2.87亿吨，与消费量的比例为16％，低于联合国粮农组织确定的保障世界粮食安全所需的17％—18％这个最低水平，从而有可能会出现1974—1975年度以来第二次世界性粮食危机。
    世界粮食生产形势欠佳的原因很多，但主要原因是近几年天公不作美，大范围的水、旱、虫、风四大灾害不时袭击地球的这片或那片地区。1988年，北美43％的耕地遭受旱灾，中美洲和加勒比海地区两次遭到飓风袭击，亚洲的孟加拉国、泰国等国连续遭受洪涝灾害，以往常受旱灾袭击的非洲撒哈拉以南地区先后遭受特大的洪水和蝗虫危害。今年伊始，旱魔又笼罩了南北美洲和欧洲南部。自1988年12月1日以来，欧洲南部的降水量仅是正常年景降水量的25％。
    近几年来，天公为什么愈益喜怒无常？许多科学家认为，这主要是生态环境遭到了严重破坏。世界上不少童山秃岭并非向来如此，而是千百年来人类的乱采滥伐或战争破坏的结果。现在，全球每年采伐森林的面积达20万平方公里，由此造成的沙漠化面积仅在萨赫勒地区就相当于一个比利时，植被破坏造成的表土流失每年达240亿吨。
    由于人类长时期以来忽视对生态环境的保护，地球上的气候发生了巨大变化。世界各国每年排放到大气中的二氧化碳多达55亿吨，其中45亿吨来自矿物燃料，10亿吨来自汽车废气。这些二氧化碳仅有一半被植物和海洋吸收，余者升空积聚在大气层中，产生“温室效应”，使气温升高，导致水、旱、风灾更为频繁、广泛和严重。科学家测得，在过去的100年里，地球气温大约上升了0.7℃，在1960年以来的不到30年里，气温上升了0.3℃，在今后的30年里，气温将上升1℃—4℃，而今天地球的气温仅比1万年以前高出5℃。可见，如今地球上气温的上升比以往大大加快了。有些科学家说，当气温升高使极地冰帽融化时，海平面将上升1米以上，那时，马尔代夫群岛、塞舌尔群岛和其他低地岛国、沿海地区有可能要被淹没。此外，极言之，如果地球上的碳都变成二氧化碳积聚在大气层中，那么，地球上的二氧化碳浓度将会达到金星上的二氧化碳浓度。显然，人们对“地球金星化”的担心并非空穴来风。金星的气温高达450℃。
    亡羊补牢，犹未为晚。在“温室效应”尚未达到不可控制、无法逆转前，全球几十亿人若能共同努力，各国尤其是工业发达国家都采取切实措施，坚持不懈地保护和改善生态环境，地球气候是完全可以逐渐好转的。生态环境改善了，世界的粮食生产将会得到可靠的自然基础。否则，不仅全世界的粮食生产问题难以解决，而且整个人类很可能要尝到“自毁家园”的恶果。可见，大力治理生态环境是全人类面临的一项迫切任务。（附图片）
