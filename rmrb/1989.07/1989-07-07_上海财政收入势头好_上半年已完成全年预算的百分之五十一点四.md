Shanghai's fiscal revenue has shown a positive trend in the first half of the year, completing 51.4% of the annual budget.

Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 6th - (Reporter Wang Hongyang) According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau today, in the first half of the year just passed, Shanghai completed fiscal revenue of 7.922 billion yuan, an increase of 3.3% over the same period last year. This has reached 51.4% of the annual revenue budget of 15.4 billion yuan, achieving the goal of completing half of the fiscal revenue in half the time.

Shanghai's fiscal revenue this year has shown a positive trend of growth in tandem with industrial production. Market sales have been brisk, and foreign-related tax revenues have increased, with commercial and industrial tax revenues continuing to grow steadily. In the first half of the year, there was a 21.5% increase over the same period last year. Among these, 12 districts saw a 29.5% increase over the same period last year, and 9 counties saw a 31.9% increase.

The finance department has analyzed that the trend for Shanghai's fiscal revenue in the second half of the year is not optimistic. The main problem is that the income of state-owned enterprises has decreased, and the growth rate of commercial and industrial tax revenues will also shrink.

    上海财政收入势头好
    上半年已完成全年预算的百分之五十一点四
    新华社上海7月6日电　（记者汪洪洋）据上海市财政局今天统计，刚刚过去的上半年，上海市完成财政收入达79.22亿元，比去年同期增长3.3％，已达到全年度收入预算154亿元的51.4％，实现了时间过半，完成财政收入过半的计划目标。
    上海财政收入今年出现了与工业生产同向增长的好势头。市场销售旺盛和涉外税收上升，工商税收持续稳定增长，上半年比去年同期增长21.5％，其中12个区比去年同期增长29.5％，9个县增长31.9％。
    财政部门分析指出，上海下半年财政收入趋势还不容乐观。主要问题是，国营企业收入出现下降，工商税收增长幅度也将有所缩小。
