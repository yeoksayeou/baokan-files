The Chinese Communist Party shines like the sun, with each qualified party member as a "bright spot." Those who are unqualified "card-carrying" party members can be called "dark spots." Many "bright spots" together form a great radiance, enhancing the image of the party; although "dark spots" are few, they significantly tarnish the party's image.

During the firefighting battle in the Greater Khingan Mountains, the famous "Bearded General" Wu Changfu's brigade had a soldier named Ma Baojiang. In the past, whenever he heard "Communist Party members charge!" in movies, he would laugh, thinking it was just acting. He often spoke harshly about party members, especially those who were hypocritical and engaged in improper practices, i.e., the "dark spots" among party members. He felt indifferent about whether or not to join the party. After arriving at the fire scene, he saw that those who charged ahead were party members, those who slept the least were party members, those who endured hunger the longest were party members, and in the "fighting fire with fire" battle, the most dangerous task of igniting the fire was almost entirely carried out by party members. He finally found the calls of "Party members, follow me!" deeply moving and genuine, feeling greatly inspired. Under the exemplary actions of the "bright spots" among party members, he decided to strive to join the party. During the firefighting, without paper, he carefully wrote an application to join the party on birch bark.

Comrade Zhang Yun once mentioned the issue of rectifying the party, saying: "Our party is like a building with a solid foundation and framework. Although it has undergone years of neglect and earthquakes, resulting in many damages and cracks, once it is carefully repaired and reinforced, it will be renewed." Regarding the "bright spots" and "dark spots" in the party's leadership and body, we should first, like Comrade Zhang Yun, adhere to the principle of "neither exaggerating virtues nor concealing vices," and make appropriate evaluations and assessments. At the same time, we must clearly see that some "dark spots" among party members, like termites in nature that specifically damage and destroy buildings, use their extremely sharp jaws and group-living, group-feeding "termites' tactics" to secretly infiltrate the "pillars" and "framework" of the socialist building to carry out "destructive activities," either corroding the body or misleading people's hearts. They have already caused parts of the body to begin to rot and decay. If effective anti-corruption and clean governance measures are not taken to curb greed and extravagance, over time, they can hollow out the solid and sturdy "building." Termites, though small, have great destructive power and are extremely harmful. Therefore, once termites are discovered, people always detest them deeply, and party organizations always strive to completely eliminate them. For "dark spots" among party members, especially those who, like termites, commit crimes and are beyond redemption, they must be decisively removed and dealt with according to law. If this "dark spot" is one's own child or relative, one should even more firmly prioritize the interests of the party and the state, truly achieving the principle of "upholding justice over personal ties."

The Chinese Communist Party is at the core of governing the country and leading all aspects of work. The construction and style of the party not only relate to the party's success or failure but also directly relate to the rise or fall of the nation, the future of the country, and the welfare of the people. Therefore, the broad masses of the people sincerely hope that every Communist Party member can strive to be a bright and clean "bright spot," rather than a "dark spot" that harms the party, especially not a "termite-like" "dark spot," so that more "bright spots" can radiate new light.

In this suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the numerous groups of "bright spots" in our martial law troops once again displayed the party's radiance over the capital.

    光点、黑点与光芒
    毛书征
    中国共产党如太阳一样光芒四射，其中每一个合格党员是一个“光点”，那不合格的“挂牌党员”则可称其为“黑点”。众多“光点”聚集成巨大光芒，为党的形象大增光彩；“黑点”为数虽少，却给党的形象抹黑不轻。
    在大兴安岭扑火战斗中，著名的“大胡子师长”吴长富所在师里，有个战士马保江，过去在电影里一听到喊“共产党员冲啊！”就感到好笑，认为是做戏。他平时对党员说话很刻薄，特别看不起那些口是心非、搞不正之风的党员，亦即党员中的“黑点”，对自己入不入党感到无所谓。来到火场后，看到冲锋在前的是党员，睡觉最少的是党员，挨饿最长的是党员，在“以火攻火”的战斗中，担任最危险的点火任务的点火手也几乎全是党员，他终于对“党员跟我上”等声音感到无比亲切、真实，感到十分振奋了。他在党员中的“光点”的模范行动感召下决心争取入党。扑火中，没有纸他就用桦树皮工工整整地写了一份入党申请书。
    章蕴同志一次在对记者谈到整党问题时，说过：“我们党犹如一幢地基和框架都相当牢固的大厦，尽管经过年久失修并经过地震，有不少破损和裂缝，一经认真修补、加固，便又面貌一新。”对党的领导和党的肌体中的“光点”和“黑点”，首先应当像章蕴同志那样，本着“不虚美，不隐恶”的原则，臧否得当，估计恰切。同时，也必须清醒地看到党员中的有些
  “黑点”，如同自然界中专门蛀食毁坏建筑物的白蚁一样，用它那锋利无比的齿唇和群居群食的“蚁海战术”，悄悄地钻到社会主义大厦的“支柱”、“框架”中进行“破坏活动”，或腐蚀肌体，或蛊惑人心，已使局部的肌体开始腐败溃烂，如不采取有效的防腐保廉、杜贪去奢措施，时间久了也能把坚固结实的“大厦”蛀食一空。白蚁虽小，能量颇大，为害极烈，所以人们一旦发现白蚁总是深恶痛绝，党组织总是千方百计彻底清除之。对党员中的“黑点”，特别是那些如白蚁一样触犯刑律不可救药的“黑点”，更必须坚决清除之后依法处理。如若这“黑点”是自己的儿女亲友，则更应当以党和国家的利益为重，切实做到大义灭亲。
    中国共产党处在执掌全国政权和领导各方面工作的核心地位，党的建设和风气如何，不仅关系到党的成功或失败，而且直接关系到民族的兴衰、国家的前途和人民的福祸。因此，广大人民群众真诚地希望：每个共产党员都能争做一个明亮无污的“光点”，而不做有损于党的“黑点”，尤其是绝不做“白蚁”类的“黑点”，以便使更多的“光点”焕发出新的光芒。
    这次平息北京的反革命暴乱，我们的戒严部队中的众多光点群体，再次把党的光芒展现在首都的上空。
