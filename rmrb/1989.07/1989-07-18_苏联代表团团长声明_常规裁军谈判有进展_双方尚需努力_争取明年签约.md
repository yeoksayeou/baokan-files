The head of the Soviet delegation to the Vienna talks on conventional arms reductions has expressed satisfaction with the progress made, stating that both sides still need to work diligently to secure an agreement by next year.

The New China News Agency reported from Moscow on July 17th that Grigoryevsky, the head of the Soviet delegation to these negotiations, made this statement at a press conference today.

Grigoryevsky identified three major advancements in this round of talks: first, both sides agreed to reduce six types of offensive military equipment, including aircraft, helicopters, tanks, armored vehicles, artillery, and personnel; second, the future agreement has taken on a relatively clear structure, with a mutual understanding that the common limits for various types of military equipment should be significantly lower than current levels; third, the negotiating bodies have begun their work and have started drafting clauses for specific issues.

The Soviet delegation head expressed dissatisfaction with NATO's insistence on the following issues: reducing all combat aircraft, including purely defensive fighter jets; only reducing Soviet and American troops stationed abroad in Europe, without addressing the 150,000 troops from Britain, France, Canada, and the Netherlands stationed in West Germany; excluding NATO's 2,000 light tanks from reduction, and attempting to leave loopholes in armored vehicles and artillery.

Grigoryevsky believes that the future of the negotiations is not entirely bright, and both sides still need to make efforts.

    苏联代表团团长声明
    常规裁军谈判有进展
    双方尚需努力  争取明年签约
    新华社莫斯科7月17日电  （记者盛世良）苏联对维也纳常规裁军谈判的进展感到满意，认为双方尚要作认真而大量的工作，争取明年签订协议。
    这是参加这一谈判的苏联代表团团长格里涅夫斯基今天在这里的记者招待会上发表的声明。
    格里涅夫斯基认为这轮谈判有3大进展：一是，双方同意应对飞机、直升机、坦克、装甲车、火炮和兵员这6项进攻性军备进行削减；二是，未来的协议已有了相当清晰的具体结构，取得了今后对各类军备的共同限额应比目前各方水平低得多的谅解；三是谈判的工作机构已开始工作，对个别问题已着手草拟条文。
    这位苏联代表团长对北约在如下问题上坚持原先立场表示不满：削减包括纯属防御性军备的歼击机在内的所有作战飞机；只削减苏美在欧洲的国外驻军，而不涉及英、法、加、荷等国驻西德的15万兵力；北约拥有的2000辆轻型坦克不列入削减的范围，在装甲战车和火炮上也想留下漏洞。
    格里涅夫斯基认为，谈判前景并非一片光明，双方尚需努力。
