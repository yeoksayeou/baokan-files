Currently, the global area of artificial forests is nearly 200 million hectares, accounting for about 7% of the total forest area. Each year, approximately 15 million hectares of artificial forests are created. Due to differences in economic development levels and consumption structures, developed countries in temperate regions often cultivate commercial forests with high industrial value and protective forests with environmental benefits. Developing countries, on the other hand, focus on cultivating fast-growing and high-yielding fuelwood forests to address urgent needs.

In North America and Europe, industrially developed countries often reforest areas that have been logged, filling in gaps where possible. Finland is famous for its vast wetlands. For many years, this country has been reclaiming wetland areas, achieving an annual reforestation of 160,000 hectares, thus maintaining forestry's enduring role as a pillar of the national economy. In the Federal Republic of Germany, urbanization consumes at least 10,000 hectares of forest land each year. However, farmers convert low-yielding marginal farmland back into forests, ensuring an annual increase of 60,000 hectares of artificial forests.

The development of artificial forests is closely linked to government support. Post-war France, facing a severe shortage of timber, established the National Forestry Foundation, levying taxes on the timber industry and trade to support the development of high-yield timber forests. Japan has implemented various regulations, provided subsidies, long-term low-interest loans, and insurance, as well as cooperative dividends for afforestation and forest management, ensuring that the area of artificial forests exceeds 10 million hectares, accounting for more than 40% of the total forest area. In the early 1980s, India proposed a goal of afforesting 40 million hectares in 10 years. To achieve this, the government invested heavily, with $350 million spent on social forestry alone from 1980 to 1985.

Countries universally emphasize improving the quality of artificial forests and promoting scientific afforestation. Brazilian forestry enterprises like Araucaria have successfully used asexual reproduction methods to produce cuttings, significantly shortening the rotation period and increasing annual growth to 70 cubic meters per hectare. As an important nitrogen-fixing tree species, Casuarina plays a role in protecting shores and fixing sand in the arid regions of Senegal, Africa. The Australian native Eucalyptus has been naturalized in dozens of developing countries. The radiata pine artificial forests in Chile and New Zealand, as well as the high-yield poplar forests in Italy, have all become major sources of timber supply in their respective countries.

In the eyes of forestry experts, artificial forests are the successors of natural forests. Economists view them as reserve resources, while environmentalists call them green treasure troves.

    人工林——绿色宝库
    王森
    当前，全世界共有人工林面积近2亿公顷，占森林总面积的7％左右。每年人工造林面积大约1500万公顷。由于经济发展水平和消费结构的差异，地处温带的发达国家大多营造商业价值较高的工业用材林和具有环境保护效益的防护林；发展中国家则侧重营造速生丰产的薪炭林，以解燃眉之急。
    在北美洲和欧洲的工业发达国家往往在采伐后的迹地更新造林，见缝插针式地补缺口。芬兰以大片的沼泽地闻名于世。多少年来，这个国家治理水湿地，以每年造林16万公顷的成绩保持着林业在国民经济中历久不衰的支柱地位。联邦德国的城镇化每年至少要吞噬1万公顷林地，但是，农民们将低产的边际农田退耕还林，保证每年新增6万公顷人工林。
    人工造林的发展是与各国政府的支持分不开的。法国战后因木料奇缺，曾专门设立了国民林业基金会，征用木材工业及贸易税，用于扶持民间发展高产用材林。日本通过制订各项法规，发放补助金，长期低息贷款，实行保险、合作分红造林育林等多种扶持林业的措施，使人工林保存面积突破了1000万公顷，占森林总面积的40％以上。80年代初期，印度提出10年造林4000万公顷的口号，为此，政府不惜投入巨额资金，1980—1985年间，仅对社会林业的投资便达3.5亿美元。
    各国普遍重视提高人工林的质量，实行科学造林。巴西的阿拉克鲁兹等林业企业利用无性繁殖方法进行插条生产的成功，极大地缩短了林木轮伐期，使年生长量猛增至每公顷70立方米。作为重要固氮树种的木麻黄，在干旱的非洲塞内加尔起着护岸和固沙的作用；原产于澳大利亚的相思树已在几十个发展中国家安家落户；智利和新西兰的辐射松人工林以及意大利的杨树丰产林等，均已成为本国木材供应的主要来源。
    在林学家看来，人工林是森林世家的接班人，经济学家视之为后备资源，环境保护主义者则将它称作绿色宝库。
