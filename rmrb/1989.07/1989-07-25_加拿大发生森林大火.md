A major forest fire, the worst in over 30 years, is currently raging in northern Manitoba, Canada. The provincial government declared a state of emergency last night and has begun a large-scale evacuation of the population.

According to reports, the severe forest fire began last week. Since July 20th, due to the threat of the fire, 18,000 people have been evacuated from the affected area, nearly half of the entire northern population. So far, there have been no reported deaths.

As of today's reports, there are 400 forest fires burning in northern Manitoba, northwestern Ontario, and northeastern Saskatchewan, with 250 of these fires within Manitoba.

Most of these fires were caused by lightning, but a few were reportedly started by humans.
