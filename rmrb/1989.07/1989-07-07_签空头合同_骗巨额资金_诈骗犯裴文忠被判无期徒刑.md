Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 6th.

Pei Wenzhong, who defrauded over 25 million yuan, was recently sentenced to life imprisonment by the Intermediate People's Court of Luliang Region, Shanxi Province, and deprived of his political rights for life.

Before his arrest, Pei Wenzhong was a farmer from Zhaishang Village, Xiaoliang Township, Hequ County, Shanxi Province. From October 1983 to October 1984, he successively partnered with others to establish the Hequ County Agricultural and Industrial Commercial Company, Pingyao Zhenhua Rolling Mill, and Linfen Huaxin Rolling Mill, serving as the general manager of each. In November 1984, he was appointed as the chairman and general manager of Luliang Steel Company and the chairman of Changzhi Yatie Factory.

From May 1984 to November 1985, Pei Wenzhong, under the pretense of selling scarce commodities such as fertilizers and steel, signed fake purchase and sale contracts with 10 units in provinces and cities including Hebei, Anhui, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Henan, and Guangdong. He swindled 9,747,700 yuan from these units and defrauded 11,019 units of Ailang-brand color televisions, amounting to a total of 25,487,700 yuan. Although he used the "prepayment" from later swindles and the televisions to repay 8,757,700 yuan of the earlier fraudulent debts, and compensated the other party for the demanded breach of contract fines and economic loss fees totaling 1,271,940 yuan, the procuratorial organs recovered 1,766,325 yuan during the investigation. Pei Wenzhong still has 12,586,146 yuan of the fraudulent funds unrecovered. Pei Wenzhong admitted in court that he personally squandered over 300,000 yuan. Additionally, the court found that Pei Wenzhong, after being sentenced to re-education through labor by the Taiyuan City Labor Reform Commission in October 1986 for soliciting prostitution, bribed over 9,000 yuan to Taiyuan City Public Security Bureau officer Pang Xinmin (already sentenced) and others to evade punishment and reduce his sentence (the bribery crime was sentenced to two years imprisonment, executed as life imprisonment).

According to the provisions of China's Criminal Procedure Law, Pei Wenzhong has appealed to the Shanxi Provincial High People's Court. The second-instance procedure of this case is currently underway.

    本报太原7月6日电　记者王艾生、新华社记者张怀京报道：诈骗2500多万元的诈骗犯裴文忠，最近被山西省吕梁地区中级人民法院一审判处无期徒刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    裴文忠捕前系山西省河津县小梁乡寨上村农民。1983年10月至1984年10月，先后与他人合伙办了河津县农工商公司、平遥振华轧材厂、临汾华新轧材厂，自任总经理；1984年11月之后，又被聘任为吕梁钢铁公司董事长兼总经理、长治亚铁厂董事长。
    1984年5月至1985年11月，裴文忠以推销化肥、钢材等紧俏商品为名，先后与河北、安徽、上海、江苏、河南、广东等省市的10个单位签订空头购销合同，骗取对方资金974.77万元，并诈骗得日产爱浪牌彩电11019台，诈骗总额达到2548.77万元。他虽用后期骗来的“预付货款”和彩电归还先期诈骗债务875.77万元，赔偿对方索要的违约金及经济损失费127.194万元，检察机关在侦查中追回176.6325万元，裴文忠尚有1258.6146万元的诈骗款未追回。裴文忠在法庭上自己承认，个人挥霍浪费30多万元。此外，法庭还查明，裴文忠在1986年10月因嫖宿流氓被太原市劳动教养委员会批准劳教后，为逃避打击、减轻处罚，还向太原市公安局干警庞新民（已判刑）等行贿9000多元，犯有行贿罪（行贿罪被判有期徒刑2年，执行无期徒刑）。
    根据我国刑事诉讼法的规定，裴文忠向山西省人民高级法院提出上诉，此案的二审程序正在进行。
