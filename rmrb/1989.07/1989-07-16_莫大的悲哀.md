To the Editor of Beijing Daily:

As a university graduate and a Beijing resident, I have closely followed the developments of the recent student movement. I have frequently visited Tiananmen Square, listened to speeches, and read leaflets. However, as the situation has evolved, I, as a person with conscience and reason, have increasingly felt a deep sadness.

Sadness One:

Many people prefer to believe rumors rather than official news reports. When old rumors are debunked by facts, instead of reflecting on why so many rumors, which are far from the truth and highly inflammatory, have spread, people quickly believe new rumors and actively spread them. It seems that if someone doesn't spread shocking news, they are seen as lacking ability. This is truly a great sadness!

Let me give two examples. First, regarding the clearing of the square. On the morning of June 4, I heard a neighbor say that the previous night, machine guns were used in Tiananmen, and many people died. When I arrived at work, a colleague told me that tens of thousands of people had died on the square, and he heard this from an old man who pulls a tricycle. This old man claimed that because there were so many bodies on the square, they were called to transport the corpses. Soon, another colleague added details, saying that during the clearing, all the lights were turned off except for those at the Great Hall of the People. Machine guns were used first, followed by tanks. Some tents were run over multiple times, and the bodies were piled up and burned. As for the number of casualties, he said that along with the east and west Chang'an Streets, there were forty or fifty thousand. When I analyzed that the clearing was likely done to minimize bloodshed, he became excited and said that history will have the final say, as if he were the one who had been wronged. Finally, another colleague said that she heard from foreign media that about 500 people died, some of whom were trampled to death while trying to escape. To be honest, because of all these rumors, I was convinced that hundreds of people had died. However, when I watched the TV and heard the explanations from Comrades Yuan Mu and Zhang, I found out that no one died! The difference was so great that I couldn't believe my ears. But after watching the video and confirming that the rumors I heard were groundless, I truly admired our people's army and felt sad for those who spread the rumors, because they were actually very knowledgeable and cultured people. They had not participated in the riot on the night of June 4, had not set up any barricades, and had not even gone to the city to watch after dawn. They simply sympathized with the student movement and did not understand why the military was entering the city, so they completely believed the rumors that hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of people had been killed and burned during the clearing, and then spread these rumors to others. This is truly sad! This reminds me of another rumor. Earlier, I heard someone wearing a badge from the Civil Aviation University of China say that Comrade Wan Li had just landed at Nan Yuan Airport and was being detained by the military. However, the next day, I learned from the news that Comrade Wan Li was then in Canada, on his way to the United States for a visit. Of course, this rumor was debunked.

Sadness Two:

Some ordinary people, out of blind following, obstructed the military's entry into the city day and night. When the military, after explaining everything and in an emergency situation, forcibly entered their posts, some people still paid with their lives to block the military's entry. The sadness lies in the fact that some people died without understanding why they had to block the military's entry.

The government has repeatedly stated that the military's entry into the city is not directed at ordinary citizens. Why don't we believe this? Why do we have sufficient reasons to not let the military enter the city? Is it because the military's entry will result in arson, looting, and killing? Or is it because the military's entry will affect our normal lives?

Perhaps someone will say that we are protecting the students who are sitting in at Tiananmen Square and in front of Zhongnanhai. This might be the only seemingly valid reason for blocking the military's entry. However, let's calmly think about it. Is the chaotic situation in Tiananmen Square and in front of Zhongnanhai worth protecting? To be honest, at the beginning of the student movement, I was also an active supporter and sympathizer. Seeing the first batch of students who went on a hunger strike in the square with the banner "Heart for the people, soul for China," I also deeply respected them. However, later, the situation in the square became increasingly unsatisfactory and even boring. Originally, the university students who went to the square to go on a hunger strike had a hunger strike declaration, so when they withdrew, they should also have a unified action. However, most of the universities in Beijing had already mysteriously withdrawn, and the main actors in the square were students from out-of-town universities who came to Beijing. They treated the square as their campsite, staying as long as they wanted and leaving as they pleased, with no one knowing how many would come and stay for how long. In the previous period, more and more people called for action, especially on the eve of June 1, the children's call was reasonable, but it was to no avail. In front of Zhongnanhai, some people had been there for a long time, lying around. They hung the military uniforms, pants, shoes, compressed biscuit boxes, and some weapons that the military had lost in front of the gate, making the originally solemn and clean front of Zhongnanhai look messy. Think about it, can the front of the White House, the office of the President of the United States, be occupied at will?

For the military to enter the city to clean up such a mess in Tiananmen Square and in front of Zhongnanhai, why do we try every means to obstruct it? Should we just let the chaos continue?

Sadness Three:

For a period of time, regardless of whether people benefited from the current policies or not, everyone had complaints. In people's conversations, it was rare to hear anyone speak fairly for the government. This is another sadness!

In the previous support activities, some people went to the streets because they were dissatisfied with the unfair distribution of society. This is somewhat understandable. However, those who benefited from the current policies, such as the already wealthy individual business owners, also supported anti-government activities. Even more ridiculous were the so-called "Flying Tigers" who rode motorcycles, carried flags, and paraded through the streets, claiming to support the cause. In fact, most of these people were those who did not engage in proper work. If it were not for the policies of these years, could these people have become rich first? However, even after becoming rich, they were still dissatisfied and took the opportunity to cause trouble for the government. Now, speaking objectively, everyone's living standards have improved, but why does the phenomenon of "eating meat and cursing the cook" exist? If we broaden our perspective, we can understand the reason. Those who rely on wages to live are dissatisfied with seeing small-scale speculators making money easily; small-scale speculators are dissatisfied with seeing officials making money even more easily; officials are dissatisfied with seeing those who frequently go abroad making a fortune; and those who frequently go abroad are dissatisfied with seeing those who can always go abroad. When they finally apply for a "green card" to live abroad, should they be satisfied? But it is some of these people who establish organizations like the "Democratic Alliance" to oppose the current government. This is truly a great sadness! Now is the time for the government to deeply reflect on its work in the previous period, to seriously think about who are the people who support the backbone of the Republic and truly contribute to the Republic? Our policies should allow which part of the people to get rich first, so that our society can be stable, and our people can live and work in peace? Also, when our government formulates policies related to people's lives (such as adjusting prices), it should be extremely cautious and seriously consider the broad masses' ability to bear the burden. Otherwise, the consequences will be very serious and difficult to repair.

专栏：

    莫大的悲哀北京日报编辑同志：
    作为一名大学毕业生，作为一个北京市民，我从这次学潮开始就密切地关注着事态的发展，我也曾经常地进出天安门广场，侧耳听过一些演说，也驻足看过一些传单。可事态发展到目前这种状况，作为一个有良知和理智的人，随着时间的推移，我越来越感到了深深的悲哀。
    悲哀之一：
    很多人宁可相信谣传，也不肯相信新闻单位的正面报道。而当旧的谣传被事实揭穿后，我们善良的人们，不是好好地反思一下，为什么会出现如此多的与事实相距甚远、而又如此具有煽动性和针对性的谣传，而是马上又去听信新的谣传，并积极地传播给别人，好像现在谁不说出些骇人听闻的传闻，谁就没本事似的。这真是莫大的悲哀！
    这方面我想举两个例子。先拿这次广场清场来说吧。我6月4日早刚起床，就听邻居说，昨晚天安门动用了机枪，死了好多人。当我刚到单位上班，就听一个同事说，广场上死了十几万人，而这个消息，他又是从一个拉三轮的老头那儿听来的，而且这个老头自称，因广场尸体太多，他们这些三轮也都被叫到广场往外运尸体。不一会儿，又进来一个同事做了进一步的描述，说广场清场时灯全部熄灭，只留大会堂这边的灯，先用机枪扫射，然后用坦克压，有的帐篷里压过第一遍仍有人在叫唤，压完后把尸体堆起来，都给烧了，至于人数，他说东西长安街加上广场共有四五十万，当我凭分析说，在清场时一定还是尽量避免流血的，他竟激动地说，历史早晚会有公论的，好像受冤枉的竟是他。最后，另一个同事说，她听了外电的消息说死了500人左右，有些是急忙逃出时被踩死的。说实在的，因为有这么多的传说，故当时我对死亡几百人，已是确信不疑了。可是，晚上看电视听了袁木和张工同志的介绍，没死一个人！差距是如此之大，我真不敢相信自己的耳朵，可当我看了录像后，确信我听来的那些传闻都是些无稽之谈时，我真为我们的人民军队叫好，也为传播这些谣言的人感到悲哀，因为他们其实都是些很有知识和文化的善良的人，他们既未参加6月4日凌晨的暴乱，也没有设置过路障，甚至在天亮后都未到市区里围观，他们仅仅是出于对学潮的同情和对于军队进城的不理解，就完全相信了几百、几千、几万、十几万甚至几十万群众在清场时被杀死、焚烧的传闻，并且又传播给其他的人，真是可悲！由此我想起另一个谣言，那是较早前我在天安门广场，听一个佩带中国民航学院校徽的人说，万里同志刚在南苑机场下飞机就被军方软禁了，可过了那天，我从新闻报道中得知万里同志那时刚离开加拿大正前往美国进行访问，当然，这个谣言就不攻自破了。
    悲哀之二：
    有些普通的群众只是出于盲从，就不分昼夜地阻止部队进城，而当部队在讲清一切道理并于情况危急、奉命强行进驻执勤岗位时，仍有部分群众为阻挡部队进城付出了生命，其中的悲哀在于，有些人到死都没搞清到底为什么一定要阻止部队进城。
    政府一再讲部队进城不是针对普通老百姓的，我们有什么理由不信，我们有什么充足的理由一定不让部队进城，是部队进城会烧杀抢掠？还是部队进城会影响你我的正常生活？
    那么，也许有人会说，我们为了保护广场上和新华门前静坐的学生，部队一进城，他们就要被轰走了。这也许是阻止部队进城的唯一的似乎站得住脚的理由。可是，我们不妨心平气和地想一想，广场上和新华门前的混乱局面是否值得我们去保护？说实在的，这次学潮之初，我也是积极的声援者和同情者，看着绝食的最初一批同学在广场上悬挂的“心为我民众，魂系我中华”的横幅，我也曾为之深表敬意。可是，后来一个时期，广场上的情形越来越令人不满，甚至使人感到无聊。本来，进驻广场绝食的大学生们有个绝食宣言，那么，撤离时也应该有统一行动，然而，原来在广场上参加绝食的北京绝大多数高校已经不明不白地撤离，而广场上唱主角的已是外地进京的高校学生，他们以广场为宿营地，愿意呆就呆，愿意走就走，来多少呆多久好像永远是个谜。前一段，越来越多的人发出呼吁，特别是六一前夕，小朋友们的呼吁本来合情合理，可都无济于事。还有新华门前，东倒西歪的一些人已经在那呆了很长时间了，那些人把部队遗失的军衣、军裤、军鞋、压缩饼干盒和一些武器装备，都挂在门前示众，把本来庄严整洁的新华门前搞得破烂不堪，请大家想想，难道美国总统办公地——白宫门前可以任凭占据吗？
    对于部队进城来整理诸如天安门广场和新华门前的这样的烂摊子，我们有什么理由千方百计地予以阻拦呢？难道就这样混乱下去？
    悲哀之三：
    一个时期，不管得没得到现行政策实惠的人，都有不满情绪，在人们的交谈中，竟极少能听到为政府说公道话的人，这真是又一个悲哀！
    前一段的声援活动中，有些人是因为对社会分配不公感到不满而走上街头的。这多少还有可以理解的因由。可现行政策的得利者，如已富了的个体户，有一些也声援反政府的活动，更加滑稽的是，所谓的“飞虎队”也骑着摩托车，扛着旗子，招摇过市，进行所谓声援。其实，这些人多数是些不务正业的人，如果不是这些年的政策，能让这些人先富起来？可是，这种人富了，也还是不满，乘机给政府制造麻烦。现在平心而论，大家的生活水平是都有提高，可为什么会出现“端起碗来吃肉，放下筷子骂娘”的现象？如果我们把视野放大一点，就能明白其中的缘由，现在是靠工资吃饭的看着“小倒”挣钱容易，有不满情绪；而“小倒”看着“官倒”挣钱更轻松，也有不满情绪，可“官倒”看着出一趟国捞几大件的，仍有不满情绪；可出一趟国的看着围着“老外”转能经常出国的还是不满，等到真正申请到了“绿卡”定居国外应该知足了吧，可正是他们中的一些人建立起什么“民主联盟”组织与现政府作对，这真是莫大的悲哀！现在是应该引起政府对前一段的工作进行深刻思考的时候了，应该认真想想，支撑共和国脊梁、真正为共和国作出贡献的到底是哪些人？我们的政策到底应该让哪部分人先富起来，我们的社会才能安定，我们的人民才能安居乐业？还有，当我们的政府在制定与人民生活密切相关的政策（如调整物价）时，应该怎样的慎而又慎，并极其认真地考虑到广大人民的承受能力，否则，由此带来的结果将是多么严重和难以弥补。
