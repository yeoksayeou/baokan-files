According to the latest statistics provided by the Shanghai Statistics Bureau, Shanghai successfully completed an industrial output value of 5.61 billion yuan in the first half of this year, a 9% increase over the same period last year. This achievement marks the completion of half of the planned production tasks within half of the time.

It is particularly worth mentioning that since June, in order to make up for the 300 million yuan loss caused by the turmoil, Shanghai workers have been fighting with a sense of ownership, achieving an output value of over 10 billion yuan and setting a new historical record. They have basically made up for all the losses.
