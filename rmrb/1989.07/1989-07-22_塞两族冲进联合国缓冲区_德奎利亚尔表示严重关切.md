Greek and Turkish Cypriots Enter UN Buffer Zone
De Cuellar Expresses Serious Concern

Xinhua News Agency, United Nations, July 21st. Reporter Liu Kai Chen reports: United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar issued a statement today expressing "serious concern" over the recent incident where Greek and Turkish Cypriots entered the UN buffer zone.

De Cuéllar, who is currently visiting southern Africa, stated in his declaration that on the evening of July 19th, approximately 1,000 Greek Cypriot demonstrators simultaneously attacked two locations within the buffer zone. The demonstrators, riding in a large car, intentionally rammed through the barricade established by the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus on the southern side. The UN observation post and the UN flag hanging there were also destroyed. The peacekeeping forces detained these demonstrators within the buffer zone. About half an hour later, several hundred Turkish Cypriot police also entered the buffer zone and broke through the UN peacekeeping forces' line, forcibly taking away about 110 Greek Cypriot demonstrators, most of whom were women.

De Cuéllar pointed out, "This incident disregards the integrity of the UN buffer zone and damages the substance of the UN forces' peacekeeping mission."

De Cuéllar stated that he does not approve of the Greek Cypriot authorities allowing Greek Cypriots to use violence to destroy UN facilities within the buffer zone. He also believes that the Turkish Cypriot side's actions of crossing the Turkish military ceasefire line and forcibly taking away the demonstrators are unacceptable.

De Cuéllar demanded that the Turkish Cypriot authorities immediately release the detained Greek Cypriots.

He called on the Greek and Turkish Cypriots to ensure that such incidents do not happen again and to fully support the mission of the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus.

The UN Security Council dispatched peacekeeping forces to Cyprus in 1964, drawing the "Green Line" between the areas controlled by the Greek and Turkish Cypriots and establishing a buffer zone to prevent armed conflicts between the two communities from resuming.

    塞两族冲进联合国缓冲区
    德奎利亚尔表示严重关切
    本报联合国7月21日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天发表声明，对最近塞浦路斯希、土两族冲进联合国缓冲区事件表示“严重关切”。
    正在南部非洲访问的德奎利亚尔在声明中说，7月19日晚，大约1000名塞希族示威者同时攻击缓冲区内两处地方，示威者乘坐的一辆大轿车有意冲破了联合国驻塞浦路斯维持和平部队建立在南边的栅栏，联合国观察站及站上悬挂的联合国旗帜也遭毁坏。和平部队把这些示威者扣留在缓冲区。约半小时后，几百名塞土族警察也进入缓冲区，并冲破联合国和平部队的防线，强行带走约110名希族示威者，其中大部分是妇女。
    德奎利亚尔指出，“这一事件无视联合国缓冲区的完整性，损害了联合国部队维持和平的实质。”
    德奎利亚尔表示，他不赞成塞希腊族当局允许希族人用暴力摧毁缓冲区内联合国设施的作法。他同时认为塞土族方面跨过土族军队停火线、强行抓走示威群众的作法也是不能接受的。
    德奎利亚尔要求塞土族当局立即释放抓走的希族人。
    他呼吁希、土两族保证不再发生这类事件，并完全支持联合国驻塞浦路斯维持和平部队的任务。
    联合国安理会在1964年向塞浦路斯派驻了维持和平部队，在希、土两族控制区之间划定“绿线”，建立了缓冲区，以防两族再度发生武装冲突。
