The majestic Tiananmen Square today was filled with songs and laughter as 20,000 military personnel and civilians from the capital gathered here in an organized celebration of the Party's birthday.

The newly refurbished north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes displayed the banners "Firmly Support the Decisions of the Fourth Plenum" and "Long Live the Great Communist Party of China." The song "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" echoed throughout the square. New party members and league members from the capital's industrial, transportation, cultural, educational sectors, and the martial law troops held a solemn oath-taking ceremony here. Performances by the "Old Mountain Warriors Troupe" and the "Capital Steel Workers Art Troupe" were warmly received by the audience. Sun Dongxia, a soprano known as the "torch" on the Old Mountain front, said that as a Communist Party member, she was particularly moved to celebrate the Party's birthday here today. She expressed her determination to propagate the spirit of the Thirteenth Party Congress's Fourth Plenum and, with the People's Liberation Army's love for the people, complete this glorious martial law mission.

Several children from Xicheng District's Xinhua Elementary School, dressed in vibrant band uniforms, spontaneously expressed their hope that Tiananmen Square would maintain good order, allowing more children to participate in meaningful commemorative activities.
