Deng Xiaoping's image appears for the first time as the main character in a feature film. The Guangxi Film Studio's large-scale, wide-screen color feature film "The Baise Uprising" premiered in Beijing today. Vice Chairman Wang Zhen had provided specific guidance and strong support for the creation of this film. Wang Zhen and Ding Guangen attended the premiere.

The film depicts the events following the end of the Guangxi-Guangdong War in 1929, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, at the request of the newly appointed Governor of Guangxi, Yu Zuobai, sent Deng Xiaoping (under the alias Deng Bin) and other communists to Guangxi to assist with the work. At the age of 25, Xiaoping helped the authorities restore order and creatively carried out united front, military, and peasant movements. At a critical moment when Yu Zuobai's rebellion against Chiang Kai-shek failed, Xiaoping made a decisive move, transferring the Communist Party-controlled troops to Baise, a key city in western Guangxi, and spreading the revolutionary storm across the Youjiang region. On December 11, 1929, Xiaoping, along with Li Mingrui, Zhang Yunyi, and other comrades, successfully launched the Baise Uprising, established the Red Seventh Army, and formed the Youjiang Soviet Government. The film showcases Xiaoping's ability to assess the situation, seize the moment, seek truth from facts, and adapt to changing circumstances, embodying the qualities of a proletarian politician and a mature Marxist.

Director Chen Jialin summarized his goals for the film in four points: concise and powerful; fast-paced and passionate; grand and majestic in large-scale scenes; and leaders portrayed in a relatable and believable manner. Lu Qi, an actor from the Sichuan People's Art Theatre, convincingly portrayed the young Deng Xiaoping.

Attending the premiere today were also relevant officials Wang Renzhi, Gao Di, and Ai Zhisheng. Chen Haosu and Tan Yingji, who personally experienced the Baise Uprising, spoke at the event.

The revolutionary epic "The Baise Uprising" has been completed by the Guangxi Film Studio and will be released on August 1. The photo shows a scene from the film: Deng Xiaoping making a crucial decision at a critical moment in the revolution, leading the troops to Baise where the peasant movement was thriving.

    再现邓小平同志韬略和风采
    《百色起义》在京首映

    本报北京7月17日讯　记者李彤报道：邓小平同志的形象第一次作为主角出现在故事片银幕上。广西电影制片厂摄制的大型彩色宽银幕故事片《百色起义》今天在北京首映。国家副主席王震对这部影片的创作曾给予具体指导和大力支持。王震、丁关根同志出席了首映式。
    这部影片描写1929年蒋桂战争结束后，中共中央应新任广西省主席俞作柏的请求，派邓小平同志（化名邓斌）等共产党人赴广西协助工作。年仅25岁的小平同志协助当局平定混乱，创造性地开展统战、兵运、农运工作。在俞作柏举旗反蒋失败的紧急关头，小平同志当机立断，把共产党掌握的部队转移到桂西重镇百色，使革命风暴席卷右江地区。1929年12月11日，小平同志与李明瑞、张云逸等同志一起成功地发动了百色起义，建立红七军，成立了右江苏维埃政府。影片表现了小平同志审时度势、掌握时机、实事求是、随机应变的无产阶级政治家的品格，表现了一个成熟的马克思主义者的胸襟和韬略。
    导演陈家林把他在影片中的追求概括为四点：短小精悍；节奏快，有激情；大场面气势磅礴；领袖人物生活化，亲切可信。四川人艺的话剧演员卢奇令人信服地再现了青年邓小平的神采。
    出席今天首映式的还有有关方面负责人王忍之、高狄、艾知生等。陈昊苏和亲身经历过百色起义的覃应机同志讲了话。
