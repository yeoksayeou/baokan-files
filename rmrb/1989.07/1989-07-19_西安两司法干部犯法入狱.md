Two judicial officials in Xi'an have been sentenced to prison for crimes. The Intermediate People's Court of Xi'an today sentenced two law enforcement officials, Lü Xiaoping and Yang Jie, to nine and eight years in prison respectively for accepting bribes. Their illegal gains have also been confiscated.

Lü Xiaoping, a former official of the Xi'an Municipal Procuratorate, took advantage of his position to extort money from parties involved in cases on three separate occasions. He used the money to purchase items such as a color television, refrigerator, and washing machine, totaling 11,650 yuan in bribes. Another former official of the Xi'an Intermediate People's Court, Yang Jie, during the trial of an economic contract dispute, privately sold a portion of tinplate, originally priced at 3,900 yuan per ton, as scrap metal at 250-500 yuan per ton. He received 15,000 yuan in bribes from this transaction.

Sun Dianqi, Deputy Secretary of the Xi'an Municipal Committee, revealed at the sentencing ceremony that the son of a bureau-level official in the Public Security Bureau (who is also a police officer) was caught burglarizing a home in northern Shaanxi. Under the pretext of "medical parole," he has been free for over a year without any resolution. Additionally, another deputy bureau-level official in the bureau only paid 500 yuan to acquire a car, and this case, despite repeated follow-ups, remains unresolved.

Since this year, the Xi'an public security department has lawfully arrested seven corrupt law enforcement officials.

Sun Dianqi warned, "The judicial system currently faces the dual task of cleaning up corrupt elements within the judicial organs and making great efforts to eliminate corruption in society. Only in this way can we gain the trust of the people."

    西安两司法干部犯法入狱
    新华社西安7月18日电　（记者华年轮）西安市中级人民法院今天以受贿罪分别判处两名执法犯法的司法干部吕小平、杨杰有期徒刑9年和8年。并没收他们的全部非法所得。
    原西安市检察院干部吕小平，利用办案之机先后三次向当事人索贿，为自己购买彩电、冰箱、洗衣机等，共受贿11650元。另一名原市中级人民法院干部杨杰在审理一起经济合同纠纷案中，私自将一部分原价为3900元一吨的马口铁作为废品以每吨250—500元的低价处理，从中收受贿赂15000元。
    西安市委副书记孙殿奇今天在宣判大会上披露，市公安局一局级干部之子（亦系公安干警）在陕北入室盗窃被抓后，竟以“保外就医”名义逍遥法外，至今已一年多未作处理；市局另一名副处级干部只出500元人民币就买了一辆汽车，此案已经多次催办仍然顶着未办。
    西安市政法部门今年以来已依法逮捕7名执法犯法的腐败分子。
    孙殿奇告诫说：“政法系统目前面临着既要清理政法机关内部的腐败分子，又要下大力气清除社会上的腐败现象的双重任务。只有这样，才能取信于民。”
