Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 1st.

The Energy Department's production meeting proposed to recover the losses caused by the turmoil. The meeting called for redoubling efforts to increase coal, electricity, and oil production.

The People's Daily, Beijing, July 1st. Reporter Liu Xiaoyang reports: To recover the losses caused by the turmoil, this year's coal production aims to exceed 1 billion tons, with state-controlled mines increasing production by 140 million tons compared to last year. Oil production must ensure the completion of 139 million tons, and electricity generation must ensure the completion of 570 billion kilowatt-hours. These are the targets set by the recently concluded energy production meeting.

In the first half of this year, under extremely difficult conditions, the broad masses of workers in China's energy sector have remained at their posts and persisted in production, achieving remarkable results. Coal, oil, and electricity production have each completed more than 48% of the annual plan. However, the tasks for the second half of the year remain very arduous. Energy industry is a fundamental industry; without progress in energy, other industries cannot advance. Therefore, the meeting requires all workers to understand the situation, redouble their efforts, and produce more energy.

The coal industry must further focus on technological transformation and mechanized production, tap the potential of working faces, and improve single-output and single-progress rates. Particularly, the single-output level of comprehensive mechanized working faces must be improved. Local state-owned coal mines account for more than half of the national output and must focus on technological transformation and various management aspects to promote stable production growth.

The electricity industry must pay attention to and strengthen fuel management, and in coordination with the railways, ensure the timely delivery of coal to achieve a coal delivery rate of 98% or higher.

The oil industry must further strengthen management, enhance water injection and increase liquid production measures, and accelerate the construction of oil production capacity to increase the daily oil production level to 1.5 million tons or more.

    能源部生产会议提出夺回动乱损失
    加倍努力干　增产煤电油
    本报北京七月一日讯　记者刘燮阳报道：为夺回动乱造成的损失，今年原煤生产要突破十亿吨大关，其中统配煤矿要比去年增产一千四百万吨；原油要保证完成一点三九亿吨；发电量要保证完成五千七百亿千瓦时。这是刚刚结束的能源生产会议提出的目标。
    今年上半年，我国能源战线广大职工在极端困难条件下，坚守岗位，坚持生产，作出了显著成绩。原煤、石油、电力都分别完成年计划百分之四十八以上。但是，下半年任务仍然十分繁重。能源工业是基础工业，能源上不去，其它工业也上不去。为此，会议要求全体职工认清形势，加倍努力工作，增产更多能源。
    煤炭工业要进一步抓好技术改造和机械化生产，挖掘工作面潜力，提高单产单进，特别要抓好综采工作面单产水平的提高。地方国营煤矿占全国产量一半以上，必须抓好技术改造和各项管理，促进产量稳步增长。
    电力工业要重视和加强燃料的管理，并配合铁路，抓好运输，保证电煤到货率达到百分之九十八以上。
    石油工业各油田要进一步加强管理，加强注水和提高产液量等增产措施，抓紧原油生产能力的建设，使原油日产水平增加到一点五万吨以上。
