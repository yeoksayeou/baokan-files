Daqing Decides to Train Newly Assigned Students

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 1 (Reporters Jiang Yaobo, Gu Wanming) The Daqing Municipal Committee recently decided that for this year's newly assigned college and university graduates, a month-long political and ideological training will be conducted before they start work.

This year, over 3,500 graduates from institutions of higher learning will come to work in Daqing. After carefully studying Deng Xiaoping's important speeches and analyzing the current situation, the Daqing Municipal Committee leaders recognized the urgency of ideological education for the newly assigned college students. Therefore, the Daqing Municipal Committee decided to conduct a short-term concentrated political and ideological training for these newly assigned graduates before they start work. The training will focus on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and the tradition of hard work and self-reliance. At the same time, these students will be organized to visit oil wells, refineries, and other facilities.

It is reported that the Daqing Municipal Committee also decided that in the future, every year's newly assigned college students will undergo this form of education.

    大庆决定培训新分配学生
    新华社哈尔滨7月1日电　（记者蒋耀波、顾万明）大庆市委日前做出决定：对今年新分配来的大中专毕业生，在上岗工作前先进行一个月左右的政治思想培训。
    今年将有3500多名高等院校毕业生来大庆工作。大庆市委领导同志在认真学习了邓小平同志的重要讲话，具体分析了当前的形势后认识到，对新分配来的大学生的思想教育工作刻不容缓。为此，大庆市委决定对这些新分配来的毕业生在上岗前先集中进行短时期的政治思想培训，并把培训重点放在坚持四项基本原则和艰苦奋斗的传统教育上，同时组织这些学生参观井队、炼油厂及其他设施。
    据悉，大庆市委还决定今后对每年新分来的大学生都采取这种教育形式。
