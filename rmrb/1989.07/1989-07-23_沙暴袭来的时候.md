    When the Sandstorm Hits
    Ma Yanfei

    Not long ago, a high-ranking official from Iraq perished in a sandstorm. If one hadn't witnessed the power of a sandstorm, it would be hard to believe such an incident.

    Last April, on a sunny day with a clear blue sky, I drove from Baghdad to Basra. Suddenly, the weather changed drastically, and in an instant, the sky darkened. A fierce wind carried a vast amount of yellow sand, covering the sky and earth. The sand and stones hit the car, making a crackling sound. I instinctively tried to escape this disaster, but all I could see was a dark mass. I could only vaguely hear the muffled sound of horns. The car moved slowly in the estimated direction, swaying in the sandstorm. Sometimes, I would bump into the car in front of me before realizing it. I slumped in the seat, my mind flashing with the line, "Everywhere green mountains bury loyal bones," thinking that this time, I would surely be buried here. Strangely, the fierce sandstorm quickly disappeared, and the sky returned to its original blue.

    Northern Iraq has a continental Mediterranean climate, with hot and dry summers. The south has a tropical climate, with temperatures sometimes reaching 50 degrees Celsius in July. Often, north and northwest winds blow, and the higher the temperature, the stronger the wind. Sometimes, the wind speed reaches around 65 kilometers per hour. The howling wind brings flying dust, making it impossible to see the direction.

    Sandstorms affect Iraq's transportation. The national highway No. 1 from Baghdad to Basra is a major north-south transportation artery, flat and wide, accommodating eight lanes of traffic. However, when a sandstorm hits, vehicles struggle to move, and the highway gets congested. The only railway parallel to this highway also suffers, often covered by sand after a sandstorm. Even more terrifying is that if people encounter a sandstorm in the wilderness and cannot avoid it, they may be choked and suffocated by the sandstorm.

    To fundamentally solve the sandstorm problem, the Iraqi government has been paying attention to afforestation for many years. An Iraqi friend confidently told me, "When the vast sand sea turns into a green forest, sandstorms will no longer come."

    沙暴袭来的时候
    马燕飞
    前不久，伊拉克的一位高级官员在一场沙暴中机毁人亡。若不是亲眼所见沙暴的力量，谁都不会相信这桩事。
    去年4月的一天，风和日丽，蓝天万里。我从巴格达驱车前往巴士拉市。途中，天气骤变，霎那间，天昏地暗。狂风正挟着漫漫黄沙铺天盖地扑来，飞沙走石打在车身上，发出噼噼啪啪的声响。我本能地赶紧逃离这灾难之地，可黑压压一片，什么也看不见，只隐隐约约听到一片沉沉的喇叭声。汽车顺着估计的方向缓行着，在沙暴中摇晃着，有时碰到了前面的汽车才恍然大悟。我瘫在车座上，脑子里不时闪现出“青山处处埋忠骨”的诗句，心想，这下非埋在这里不可了。说来也怪，来势汹汹的沙暴，很快又销声匿迹，天又恢复了它原有的湛蓝。
    伊拉克北部，属于大陆性地中海型气候，夏季酷热干燥。南部是热带气候，7月份的温度有时高达摄氏50度，还往往刮起北风和西北风，气温越高，风力越大，有时时速达65公里左右，狂风怒吼带来尘土飞扬，让人看不清方向。
    沙暴使伊拉克的交通受到一定的影响。巴格达到巴士拉的这条国家1号高速公路，是纵贯伊拉克南北的交通大动脉，平坦、宽阔，可供8辆车对行，但当沙暴袭来的时候，车辆难行，公路受堵，与这条公路平行的伊拉克唯一的铁路也难逃厄运，沙暴之后，铁路也常常被沙土覆盖。更为可怕的是，人们在野外碰上沙暴，躲避不及，还会被沙暴连抽带呛，窒息死亡。
    为了从根本上解决沙暴问题，伊拉克政府多年来一直注意植树造林。伊拉克朋友充满信心地对我说，“等到浩瀚沙海变成绿色林野的时候，沙暴就不会再来了。”
