Tan Guocheng Repeatedly Violates Family Planning Policies and Is Expelled from the Party

On November 30 of last year, your newspaper's fifth edition published an investigative report titled "Continuing the 'Lineage' Makes This Village Secretary Have Eight Children." After investigation, the report's reflections are accurate.

Before 1980, Tan Guocheng already had five daughters, but he still wanted a son. Therefore, he used various excuses to avoid sterilization surgery, even kneeling twice before the operating doctor to obtain a fake "sterilization surgery certificate." Afterward, he consecutively had two more daughters. On August 4, 1986, Tan Guocheng finally had a son, so he spread the news and held a grand banquet.

Local residents strongly opposed Tan Guocheng's violation of family planning policies and exposed him to relevant departments. After learning of this, Tan Guocheng not only did not admit his mistake but became angry and instructed his brother-in-law to beat the informants. The county committee believed that Tan Guocheng had lost the basic standards of a Communist Party member. After discussion by the local party organization and approval by the county disciplinary committee, it was decided to expel Tan Guocheng from the party and notify the entire county.

    谭国成一再超生被开除党籍
    去年11月30日，你报第五版刊登了信访调查《续“香火”使这个村支书连生八胎》。经查，信访调查反映的情况属实。
    1980年前，谭国成已有5个女孩，但他仍想要个男孩。于是，他以种种借口，逃避绝育手术，甚至两次向主刀医生屈膝，求得假“绝育手术证明书”。此后，他又接连得了两个女孩。1986年8月4日，谭国成终于得了一男孩，于是到处报喜，大办酒宴。
    当地群众对谭国成的超生问题强烈不满，纷纷向有关部门揭发。谭国成知情后不仅不认错，反而恼羞成怒，指使他的妻弟对检举者大打出手。县委认为，谭国成已经丧失了一个共产党员的起码标准。经当地党组织讨论，报县纪委批准，决定给予谭国成开除党籍的处分并通报全县。
