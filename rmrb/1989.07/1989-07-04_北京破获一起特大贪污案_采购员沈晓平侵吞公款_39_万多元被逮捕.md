    Beijing Cracks Down on Major Embezzlement Case
    Purchasing Officer Shen Xiaoping Embezzles 390,000 Yuan and Is Arrested

    New China News Agency, Beijing, July 4 (Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Pang Jichang, Beijing Daily reporter Chen Yuhe, New China News Agency reporter Huang Zhimin): The case of Shen Xiaoping, a purchasing officer at the Microelectronics Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who embezzled 391,000 yuan, has been cracked by the Chaoyang District People's Procuratorate of Beijing. This is the largest embezzlement case in Beijing since the founding of the People's Republic of China.

    This case involves 12 suspects, of whom 6 have been arrested and the other 6 are out on bail pending trial.

    It was found that Shen Xiaoping, 31 years old, began embezzling after becoming a purchasing officer in early 1985. He colluded with Li Yucai, the manager of the Silver Swallow Photography Equipment Department, and Wang Zilong, the deputy manager, starting with adding the cost of a lighter and a pair of sunglasses to the purchase invoices for public goods. They began their embezzlement activities. Shen Xiaoping handed over 32 blank checks to Li Yucai and Wang Zilong, using them to buy more than 20 high-end items such as color TVs, VCRs, and cameras. Li Yucai and Wang Zilong helped Shen Xiaoping change these high-end items into "labor protection supplies," "refrigerant ammonia," and "equipment processing fees" for the unit to reimburse. The total amount of money drawn from the bank for these 32 checks was more than 212,000 yuan, of which only 36,000 yuan was used for public purchases. The remaining 170,000 yuan was embezzled by Shen Xiaoping. Li Yucai and Wang Zilong received 6,300 yuan and 702 yuan respectively from the embezzled funds.

    When Shen Xiaoping had large amounts of cash in his hands, he was still not satisfied and wanted to expand his "network" to make more money. In the autumn of 1986, Shen Xiaoping met Hama Mingde, the deputy manager of the collective enterprise "Fero Technology Service Company," and Huang Liwei, the manager of the development department. Shen Xiaoping immediately gave them 13 blank checks, withdrawing a total of 80,000 yuan in cash, all of which was embezzled. This company does not engage in the sale of "ammonia" and "descaling agents," nor does it have the technology to process high-precision integrated circuit "frames." However, they forged purchase and processing invoices for these three items and submitted them to the unit for reimbursement.

    Shen Xiaoping also met Zhang Xiaomin, the manager of Yue Tai Commercial Center, through Guo Jiaquan, a business representative of the West City District Yue Tai Commercial Center. Shen Xiaoping repeated his old tricks, handing over 17 blank checks to Zhang Xiaomin. Zhang Xiaomin, who manages a department store selling daily necessities and clothing, provided Shen Xiaoping with purchase invoices for chemical products, totaling more than 150,000 yuan. Zhang Xiaomin and Guo Jiaquan received 100,000 yuan and 35,000 yuan respectively from the embezzled funds.

    Preliminary investigations revealed that from March 1985 to December 1987, Shen Xiaoping used the names of processing and purchasing to obtain 62 checks from the unit, totaling more than 440,000 yuan. However, only 41,000 yuan was spent on purchasing items for the unit, and the remaining 390,000 yuan was covered by fake delivery notes.

    Wang Baoshan, the director of the Microelectronics Center Equipment Department, and Liu Chengding, the deputy director, signed off on the obviously flawed fake delivery notes after receiving benefits from Shen Xiaoping, giving the green light to his criminal activities.

    Currently, this case has been prosecuted by the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch to the Beijing Intermediate People's Court. The case is under trial.

    北京破获一起特大贪污案
    采购员沈晓平侵吞公款39万多元被逮捕
    新华社北京7月4日电（中央人民广播电台记者庞际昌、北京日报记者陈玉和、新华社记者黄智敏）中国科学院微电子中心器材处采购员沈晓平贪污公款39.1万元的案件，已由北京市朝阳区人民检察院破获。这是建国以来发生在北京市的最大一起贪污案。
    这起案件共涉及案犯12名，现已有6名案犯被依法逮捕，另6名案犯为取保候审。
    经查实，现年31岁的沈晓平，从1985年初当上采购员之后，便与银燕摄影器材部经理李玉才和副经理王子龙相勾结，从最初的把一个打火机和一副变色镜的货款加在公家购置物品的发货票上，开始了他们的贪污活动。沈晓平先后交给了李玉才、王子龙32张空白支票，为自己买了彩电、录相机、摄象机等20多种高档商品。李玉才、王子龙两人帮沈晓平把这些高档商品改成公家买的“劳保用品”、“制冷液胺”、“器材加工费”等，回单位报销。这32张支票从银行支出总金额21.2万多元，其中为公家购物的用款只花3.6万多元，其余的17万余元全被沈晓平侵吞。李玉才从中得赃款6300元，王子龙得赃款702元。
    当钞票大把大把地落到沈晓平手上后，他仍不知足，渴望扩大“关系网”，捞到更多的钱。1986年秋天，沈晓平结识了集体企业“费罗技术服务公司”副经理哈明德和这个公司开发部经理黄立伟。沈晓平一下就拿给他们13张空白支票，共套取出现金8万余元，全被他们侵吞。这个公司既不经营“液胺”和“除垢剂”的销售业务，更无加工精度极高的集成电路“框架板”的技术。但他们竟假造出“购买”和“加工”这三种商品的发货票，回单位报销。
    沈晓平还通过西城区粤泰商场业务员葛家全结识了粤泰商场经理张晓民。沈晓平故伎重演，先后交给张晓民17张空白支票，身为经营百货和服装的商场经理张晓民，却为沈晓平提供了“购买”化学物品的发货票，总金额达15万余元。张晓民和葛家全分别从中获取赃款1万元和3.5万元。
    经初步查证，沈晓平从1985年3月至1987年12月以加工、购物为名，从单位领出62张支票，总金额达44万多元，但为单位购置东西只花4.1万多元，其余39万余元全是用假发货票抵平的。
    微电子中心器材处处长王宝山、副处长刘成鼎在得到沈晓平的“好处”后，便在有明显破绽的假发货票上签字准予报销，为他的犯罪活动大开绿灯。
    目前，这起案件已由北京市人民检察院分院向北京市中级人民法院提起公诉。此案正在审理中。
