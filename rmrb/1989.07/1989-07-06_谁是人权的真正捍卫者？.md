The clamor for "human rights" that once filled the capital has subsided with the suppression of the turmoil. Now, any righteous person can answer, based on personal experience, who the true defenders of human rights are and who the tramplers of human rights are. An important task in the current ideological sphere is to analyze the issue of human rights with rational thinking and legal perspectives, and to expose the true intentions of domestic and foreign evil forces hiding behind the banner of "human rights."

Human rights are a concept proposed by modern bourgeois enlightenment thinkers in response to the feudal rule and privileges of the Middle Ages. They believed that people have "innate" basic rights. Entering this century, especially after experiencing two world wars, the international community has paid special attention to human rights issues. In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the first international human rights legal document, the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights." With the independence of a large number of colonies, international human rights theory has continuously been infused with new content. In 1966, the United Nations adopted the "International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights" and the "International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights," which stipulated the right to self-determination and the right to dispose of natural resources, placing collective human rights in an important position and breaking through the traditional Western bourgeois concept of human rights centered on the individual. In 1986, with the unremitting efforts of Third World countries, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the "Declaration on the Right to Development," affirming the right of a country to develop and utilize its own economic, cultural, and resource wealth without interference, further developing the concept of collective human rights. In addition, the United Nations has adopted a series of resolutions, declarations, and conventions against colonialism, racism, and other issues. Over the past 40 years, international human rights issues have continuously evolved and developed, and human rights are no longer the exclusive property of Western countries but also reflect the demands and aspirations of the vast majority of developing countries.

The Chinese government has always attached great importance to human rights issues. Internationally, it has consistently supported and supported the work and efforts of the United Nations to maintain human rights, joining seven international human rights conventions and actively fulfilling its obligations. The Chinese government has given clear moral support and assistance within its capacity to developing countries in their opposition to hegemony, colonialism, racism, foreign invasion and occupation, and the unjust international economic order, as well as in promoting the development of national economies in Third World countries, earning high praise from the international community.

Domestically, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the Chinese people have embarked on the socialist path, which is the basic premise for the realization of individual and collective human rights. The constitution and laws of China ensure the basic rights of citizens in politics, economy, culture, education, religion, personal freedom, and the lives of women, children, the elderly, and social life. As early as the founding of the People's Republic, China had basically eliminated the evil practices of prostitution, drug addiction, trafficking in people, and arranged marriages left over from the old society. In 1959, the extremely barbaric and cruel system of serfdom in Tibet was completely eliminated, freeing a million serfs from the shackles of personal dependence and giving them the right to be masters of their own homes. China has also been tirelessly promoting the economic, cultural, and educational development of various ethnic minorities, improving their political and economic status, and making them equal members of the national family. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China has proposed the grand goal of achieving the Four Modernizations, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, and reform and opening up, aiming to fully bring out the advantages of the socialist system, develop social productive forces, and improve the material and cultural living standards of the people, which is a fundamental guarantee of the human rights of Chinese citizens.

Of course, China's legal protection of citizens' rights is not yet perfect, and there are still some problems in the protection of human rights. Especially during the ten years of turmoil, from the Chairman of the State to ordinary citizens, basic human rights were severely infringed upon, and national laws were virtually non-existent, with the national economy on the brink of collapse, leaving us with extremely painful lessons. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China has made efforts to promote socialist democracy and improve socialist legal systems, changing the situation. Now, there are still many unsatisfactory aspects in China's protection of human rights. Some long-eradicated practices of infringing upon human rights, such as prostitution, buying and selling marriages, and employing child labor, have resurfaced in some regions. Therefore, we must further strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and legal systems and, through democratic and legal means, ensure that human rights are more effectively protected.

Human rights are not abstract but concrete, not absolute but relative. The specific provisions of each country's laws on citizens' rights and the actual situation of citizens' rights in real life are inevitably subject to various factors such as the country's political system, economic relations, cultural traditions, and customs. Therefore, there is no and cannot be an abstract human rights model that is universally applicable to the entire human society. Citizens' rights can only be concrete and real. At the same time, the legal protection of citizens' rights must necessarily be accompanied by restrictions on rights. Every citizen, while realizing their own rights, cannot harm the interests of others or society. Therefore, human rights can only be relative and constrained, not absolute and unlimited. The attempt to obtain rights without obligations is an unrealistic fantasy.

In this counter-revolutionary turmoil, a small number of people advocating absolute and abstract human rights disregarded the constitution and laws, inciting illegal strikes, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes, seriously disrupting the normal order of study, work, and life for others, and using extremely brutal means to beat and even kill soldiers and armed police. Where is the democracy and human rights in this? This small group of rioters, shouting "democracy" and "human rights," are actually engaging in thoroughly anti-democratic and anti-human rights activities; they shout "patriotism" but actually collude with foreign forces, aiming to replace our socialist People's Republic with a bourgeois republic.

Using the pretext of protecting human rights and claiming to be "human rights defenders" to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries is a common trick used by certain Western countries, especially the United States. Throughout the process of the Chinese government's suppression of the turmoil and rebellion, the U.S. government and Congress, under the pretext of "protecting human rights," shamelessly interfered in China's internal affairs, which is the latest example. After the turmoil broke out, the U.S. President repeatedly stated: "Supporting the Chinese demonstrators' demand for freedom of speech, peaceful assembly, including the freedom to protest and express peacefully"; "The United States will do everything it can to encourage those seeking democracy in China and elsewhere." The Congress passed a resolution supporting the so-called "Chinese democracy movement," demanding to establish a "free and open political system that protects basic human rights" in China. After China took decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion on June 4, the U.S. government was even more enraged, taking the lead in imposing "sanctions" on China and exerting pressure. After China executed 11 extremely heinous rioters in accordance with the law, the U.S. further announced the "suspension" of high-level official exchanges and demanded that international financial institutions "delay" loans to China, blatantly threatening and interfering with China.

The theoretical basis for the U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries under the pretext of human rights is the so-called "international protection of human rights." Whether human rights are subject to "international protection" or "domestic jurisdiction" should be determined based on specific situations and treated differently. Any new and old colonialism, hegemony, and infringement on the self-determination rights, development rights, and individual human rights of other nations are international issues and should be condemned and opposed by the international community. Acts of racial discrimination, racial segregation, racial genocide, slave trading, large-scale creation, expulsion, and persecution of refugees, as well as terrorist activities in other countries and within one's own country, are all prohibited international crimes of human rights violations, and other countries taking measures to stop them are in accordance with international law. However, respecting citizens' rights, protecting ethnic minorities, women, and children, and legally punishing criminals are all subject to the domestic laws of sovereign states and are matters of domestic jurisdiction. No country or international organization has the right to interfere in any form. Therefore, whether it is China's so-called "Tibet issue," the legal sentencing of the counter-revolutionary criminal Wei Jingsheng, or the suppression of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, they are all matters of "domestic jurisdiction," and the United States has no right to interfere under the pretext of human rights issues.

The United States is always meddling in human rights issues, as if it were the only defender of human rights. Let's take a look at the facts. The infamous anti-communist, anti-China McCarthy Act is still fresh in people's memory; more than 100 years after the Emancipation Proclamation in the United States, discrimination against blacks and other colored people still exists seriously. When the working people exercise their freedoms of speech, assembly, association, and demonstration, endangering the rule of monopoly capital, the U.S. government sends out military police to brutally suppress them, and the examples are countless. In international relations, the United States, as the "international police," has always supported the apartheid system in South Africa, brazenly invaded Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, and many other sovereign countries, and has never stopped its brutal interference and subversive activities in the internal affairs of other countries. This is the true face of the U.S. "human rights defender." What qualifications does it have to comment on China's human rights issues?

What is the true purpose of the United States' concern for China's "human rights issues"? One of the editors of the "Democracy Magazine" published by the "National Endowment for Democracy," which is backed by the U.S. Congress, Larry Diamond, revealed the secret, saying that in promoting world human rights and the "democratization" movement, the task for communist countries is to let the "democratic elements" in these countries establish networks, "publish independent publications, establish independent unions, enterprises, and other organizations," to "break the monopoly of the party and government (of this country) in information, organization, and power," thereby "reducing the power of the government," and finally "seizing power." Look, the strategy revealed by this strategist is strikingly similar to the action program of a small number of people in China's counter-revolutionary rebellion. From this, it is not difficult to understand that the United States, under the pretext of human rights, interferes in China's internal affairs and exerts pressure on China, aiming to force the Chinese government to legalize illegal organizations such as "the Autonomous Federation of University Students" and "the Autonomous Federation of Workers," and ultimately to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and change the socialist system. But this is in vain. However, we can gain profound lessons and enlightenment from this living negative example.

    谁是人权的真正捍卫者？
    史云
    一度充斥首都的“要人权”的喧嚣声随着暴乱被平息而沉寂下来后，凡是正直的人们，恐怕都能以亲历的事实，回答到底谁是人权的捍卫者，谁是人权的践踏者。当前思想领域的一个重要任务是，要以理性的思维和法律的观点对人权问题作出分析，揭露国内外邪恶势力在“人权”幌子的掩盖下究竟是怎么回事。
    人权，是近代资产阶级启蒙思想家针对中世纪的封建统治和特权提出来的。他们认为，人们具有“天赋”的各种基本权利。进入本世纪后，特别是经历了两次世界大战，国际社会对人权问题给予了特殊的关注。1948年，联合国大会通过了第一部国际性人权法律文件《世界人权宣言》。随着大批殖民地国家取得独立，国际人权理论不断注入了新的内容。1966年，联合国通过的《公民权利和政治权利国际公约》和《经济、社会、文化权利国际公约》，规定了民族自决权，对天然财富与资源的处置权等，把集体人权摆到重要地位，突破了西方资产阶级传统的以个人为本位的人权概念。1986年，在第三世界国家的不懈努力下，联大又通过了《发展权宣言》，确认了一个国家发展利用自己的经济文化、财富资源而不受侵犯的权利，使集体人权概念得到新的发展。此外，联合国还通过了一系列反对殖民主义、种族主义等决议、宣言和公约。40余年来，国际人权问题不断演变、发展，人权已不再是西方国家的专利品，也集中反映了广大发展中国家的要求和愿望。
    我国政府一贯重视人权问题。在国际上，始终赞赏和支持联合国为维护人权所做的工作和努力，加入了七个国际人权公约并积极履行义务。我国政府对发展中国家反对霸权主义、殖民主义、种族主义、外来侵略占领和不合理的国际经济秩序以及促进第三世界国家发展民族经济等方面，都给予鲜明的道义支持和力所能及的援助，得到国际社会的高度评价。
    在国内，我国人民在共产党的领导下，走上了社会主义道路，这是个人人权和集体人权得以实现的基本前提。我国制定的宪法、法律使公民的政治、经济、文化教育、宗教信仰、人身自由，以及妇女、儿童、老人和社会生活等各项基本权利有了切实保障。早在建国初期，我国就基本上消灭了旧社会遗留下来的卖淫、吸毒、买卖人口、包办婚姻等丑恶现象。1959年又彻底铲除了极其野蛮、残酷的西藏农奴制度，使百万农奴摆脱任人奴役的人身依附的桎梏，获得了当家作主的权利。我国还始终不懈地大力发展各少数民族的经济文化和教育事业，提高了他们的政治经济地位，使他们成为祖国大家庭中的平等一员。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国提出了实现四个现代化的宏伟目标，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，目的是要使社会主义制度所固有的优越性更加充分地发挥出来，以发展社会生产力，提高人民的物质文化生活水平，这是从根本上进一步保障我国公民的人权表现。
    当然，我国对公民权利的法律保障还不十分完备，在维护人权方面还存在一些问题。特别是在十年动乱期间，从国家主席到普通公民，基本人权受到严重侵犯，国家法律荡然无存，国民经济濒临崩溃的边缘，给我们留下了极为惨痛的教训。党的十一届三中全会后，我国努力发扬社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，上述状况得到了改变。现在，我国在维护人权方面还有不少不尽人意的地方，一些早已绝迹的侵犯人权的陋习，如卖淫、买卖婚姻、雇佣童工等现象又在某些地区死灰复燃。因此，我们必须进一步加强社会主义民主与法制建设，通过民主和法制手段，使人权得到更加切实的保障。
    人权不是抽象的而是具体的，不是绝对的而是相对的。每一个国家的法律对公民权利的具体规定，现实生活中公民权利的实际状况，都必然受制于该国的政治制度、经济关系、文化传统、风俗习惯等多种因素。所以，没有也不可能有为整个人类社会普遍适用的、抽象的人权模式，公民权利只能是具体的、现实的。与此同时，法律对公民权利的保障，又必然伴随着对权利的限制。每一个公民在实现自己的权利的同时，不能因此损害他人乃至社会的利益。所以，人权只能是相对的、有制约的，而不是绝对的、无限制的。企图得到一种不尽义务的权利，是一种不切实际的空想。
    在这次反革命暴乱中，鼓吹绝对的、抽象的人权的极少数人置宪法和法律于不顾，煽动非法罢课、游行示威、静坐绝食，严重干扰了他人正常的学习、工作和生活秩序，并用极其残忍的手段，殴打以至杀害解放军和武警官兵。这哪里还有民主、人权可言？这一小撮暴徒，口口声声“要民主”、“要人权”，干的却是彻头彻尾的“反民主”、“反人权”的勾当；他们口口声声高喊“爱国”，干的却是里通外国，其目的是要用资产阶级共和国取代我们社会主义的人民共和国。
    打着维护人权的幌子，以“人权卫士”自居，干涉别国内政，是某些西方国家尤其是美国惯用的伎俩。在我国政府平息动乱和暴乱的全过程中，美国政府和国会借口“维护人权”肆无忌惮地干涉中国内政，就是最新的实例。动乱发生后，美国总统就多次声称：“支持中国示威学生要求的言论自由、和平集会的权利，其中包括和平抗议和表达的自由”；“美国将做它能做的一切来鼓励中国和其他地方寻求民主的人们”。国会通过支持所谓中国“民主运动”的决议，叫嚣要在中国“建立一个保护基本人权的自由和开放的政治制度”。6月4日我国采取坚决措施平息反革命暴乱后，美国政府更是恼羞成怒，带头对我国采取“制裁措施”，施加压力。在我国依法处决11名罪大恶极的暴徒后，美国又进而宣布“暂停”双边高级官员互访，并要国际金融机构“推迟”对我国贷款，露骨地对我国进行恫吓和干涉。
    美国以人权为名干涉别国内政的理论根据，是所谓人权的“国际保护”论。人权是属于“国际保护”还是属于“一国管辖事项”，应根据具体情况、区别对待。凡是新老殖民主义、霸权主义侵犯别国的民族自决权、发展权和个人人权，都属于国际问题，应受到国际社会的谴责和反对。对别国和在本国内实行种族歧视、种族隔离、种族灭绝、贩卖奴隶，大规模地制造、驱赶和迫害难民以及搞恐怖活动等，都是应禁止的侵犯人权的国际罪行，其他国家采取措施予以制止符合国际法准则。但是，尊重公民权利，保护少数民族、妇女、儿童，依法对犯罪分子进行惩处等，都是受主权国家国内法规范的，均属国内管辖事项，任何国家或国际组织不得进行任何形式的干涉。因此，无论是我国所谓的“西藏问题”，对反革命犯罪分子魏京生的依法判刑等，还是这次平息反革命暴乱，都纯属“一国管辖的事项”，美国无权借口人权问题进行干涉。
    美国在人权问题上到处指手划脚，好像只有它才是人权的维护者。那末，我们不妨来看看事实。臭名昭著的反共、反华的麦卡锡法案，世人至今记忆犹新；在美国解放黑奴宣言发表100多年以后，对黑人和其他有色人种的歧视仍然严重存在。当劳动人民在行使言论、集会、结社、示威等自由权利危及垄断资本统治时，美国政府出动军警残酷镇压的事例，更不胜枚举。在对外关系方面，美国俨然以“国际宪兵”自居，一贯支持南非种族隔离制度，悍然出兵侵略朝鲜、越南、格林纳达等许多主权国家，从来没有停止过对别国内政的粗暴干涉和阴谋颠覆活动。这就是美国“人权卫士”的真相。它在人权问题上，有什么资格对中国说三道四？
    美国如此关心中国“人权问题”的目的究竟何在？以美国国会为靠山的“全国争取民主赠款基金会”主办的《民主杂志》两主编之一拉里·戴蒙德一语泄露天机，他说，美国在促进世界人权和“民主化”运动中，对于共产党国家的任务是让这些国家的“民主分子”建立起网络，“创办独立的出版物，另立工会、企业团体和其他组织”，以“突破统治（这个国家的）党和政府在信息、组织和权力方面的垄断”，从而“缩小政府的权力”，最后“接管政权”。请看，这位谋士披露的方略同中国这次反革命暴乱中极少数人的行动纲领何其相似乃尔。由此不难明白，美国借口人权干涉中国内政，向中国施加压力，就是要迫使中国政府承认“高自联”、“工自联”之类的非法组织合法化，进而达到推翻共产党的领导，改变社会主义制度的罪恶目的。但这完全是徒劳的。不过，我们倒可以从这一活生生的反面教材中获得深刻的教益和启示。
