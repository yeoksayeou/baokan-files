Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, July 11th.

Philippine President Corazon Aquino arrived in West Germany on the morning of July 9th and took a Philippine Airlines commercial flight instead of a dedicated government aircraft.

The Philippine ambassador to West Germany explained that this was done to save expenses. State visits typically incur significant costs. This afternoon, she will continue to Paris by commercial flight. In fact, the Philippine economy has shown considerable improvement, transitioning from the stagnation of the Marcos era to three consecutive years of growth exceeding 6%.

    菲总统出访乘班机
    本报波恩7月11日电　记者江建国报道：菲律宾总统阿基诺夫人9日早晨抵达西德访问时，乘的是一架菲律宾航空公司班机，而非专机。
    菲律宾驻西德大使解释说，这是为了节约经费。因为国事访问一向耗资不少。今天下午她仍乘班机前往巴黎。其实，菲律宾经济目前已有相当好转，从马科斯时代的停滞状态已转为连续3年6％以上的增长率。
