Managing a school well starts with having a good principal. How principals are selected and how they are optimized has become a key issue in the reform of middle and primary school management systems, and it has become a difficult problem for educational administrative departments.

Since the founding of the nation, our middle and primary school cadres have mainly been appointed through a system of appointment, with principals being appointed or assigned by higher authorities. This method has been in use for many years, gradually forming a fixed pattern and playing a certain role; but as educational reform deepens, its shortcomings have become increasingly apparent and are facing challenges.

As reform deepens, the method of "selecting talents by eye" is being challenged

Firstly, this method of relying on higher-level organizational departments to identify talent is being impacted by the trend of reform towards selecting talents through fair competition; especially in places where the atmosphere is not right, this method has become a breeding ground for the saying "if I say you can do it, you can; if I say you can't, you can't." Secondly, due to the lack of a competitive mechanism, seniority and "appointing based on seniority" prevail, making it difficult for truly capable individuals to stand out, and schools lack vitality. Thirdly, there is no mechanism for the appointment of cadres to be flexible, with some either too old to keep up or too conservative to keep up with the pace of reform, and they cannot be removed; one principal changed schools seven times and never managed to run one well. The principal's position cannot change, and the principal sits on a genuine "iron chair," hindering some schools from changing their backward appearance.

From various places across the country, information is constantly coming in about challenges to this rigid model.

- In Changyi County, Shandong, 198 new principals were appointed through public bidding and selection for middle and primary schools;
- In Kunming, the election of middle school principals has resulted in 26 new principals for 26 schools, accounting for about two-thirds of the city's middle schools;
- In Fang County, Hubei, democratic elections for middle and primary school principals have been implemented in 309 schools, accounting for 43% of the county's total middle and primary schools; ...

Shunyi County in Beijing chose to use the recruitment of principals as a breakthrough for educational management system reform. In the first half of this year, the recruitment of principals for all 42 middle schools in the county was successfully completed. Forty-two principals with authority, a sense of mission, and a spirit of innovation took office, and the sense of ownership among teachers and staff increased, making the schools full of vitality.

Among the 42 principals recruited, 10 are new, accounting for about one-quarter, of whom 4 are former deputy principals, 5 have held middle-level positions, and 1 is a teacher. With the infusion of new blood, the age structure and knowledge structure of the county's middle school principals have undergone a gratifying change. The average age of the 42 middle school principals has dropped from 50 to 46; the proportion of middle-aged and young principals has increased from 43% to 67%; and the proportion of those with a college education or higher has increased from 55% to 72%.

The debate ends, new principals emerge

"Currently, the educational quality of our school is relatively low, and it is in a backward position in the county. There are phenomena of students disliking and dropping out of school. What do you think are the main reasons?"

"How do you evaluate the enthusiasm of the teachers in our school?"

"If you become the principal, how will you adjust the school's leadership team?"

These were questions posed by teachers to three candidates at the principal recruitment meeting for Zhang Xizhuang Middle School. The venue set up in the township government was very solemn, and the atmosphere in the venue was heated and lively. Leaders from the county, township, and education bureau attended the meeting. After the three candidates gave their speeches on school management, the debate was intense.

Zhang Xizhuang Middle School was originally a school with a good foundation, but in the past two years, due to the successive retirement of key leaders, the school's work has stagnated. The phenomenon of students disliking and dropping out of school is relatively serious: from the first year of junior high to the third year, nearly 80 students have dropped out in recent years, with a dropout rate of 24%. Teachers and staff have a sense of backwardness and oppression and a sense of urgency for reform, and they have a strong expectation of selecting a good principal to change the school's appearance. With the mobilization of the township government, a teacher, a former deputy principal, and a former deputy director of education participated in the recruitment. After self-recommendation and recommendation, public debate, public opinion survey, extensive consultation with teachers and staff, seeking opinions from county and township leaders, and repeated negotiations, it was decided to recruit the 41-year-old former deputy director of education, Liang Baohuang, as the principal. Liang Baohuang has been teaching in this school for 15 years, and seeing the school's work not progressing and the teaching quality ranking 34th out of nearly 40 schools in the county, he has been very anxious. He took office with this determination. After taking office, he was full of energy, and his work was both bold and meticulous. The teachers felt that the newly appointed principal was "satisfactory" and that there was hope for removing the backward hat. Currently, the appearance of Zhang Xizhuang Middle School has improved, and the phenomenon of student dropout has been controlled. The teachers have brought back the dropped-out students one by one, and those who fall behind in their studies are given remedial classes, striving not to leave anyone behind.

The recruitment of Zhang Xizhuang Middle School is a microcosm of the entire Shunyi County principal recruitment process. The county's 42 middle schools had 52 people participating in the election. Among them, 13 were self-recommended, and 4 were successful; 39 were recommended by teachers and staff, the school's party branch, and the township government, and 1 was unsuccessful. Some candidates proposed that if they did not complete the term targets, they would automatically forfeit their annual bonuses, and some proposed to deduct a portion of their salary to be used as a risk deposit for the school, expressing their determination and ambition to share the school's honors and disasters. The principals who took office generally had a sense of honor, mission, and crisis.

At the beginning of the recruitment, the old principal of Yanggezhuang No. 1 Middle School, Rong Baoliang, was a typical example of voluntarily stepping down.

Rong, the 53-year-old principal, graduated from a college in 1960 and was assigned to teach in a middle school, with nearly 30 years of service; since 1970, he has been the principal for 18 years. He worked diligently and conscientiously, and the hard work ruined his health, and he suffered from hypokalemia. As soon as the recruitment work began, he considered that after the principal's responsibility system, there would be a three-year term target, and the power would be greater, and the responsibility would be heavier. Rather than struggling on with his illness, it would be better to let a younger comrade take on the heavy responsibility? He recommended a younger comrade and talked to the younger comrade, explaining that even if he stepped down from the position of principal, he would fully support the work of the new principal. Through the recommendation of the school union and the public opinion survey of all teachers, the 41-year-old former deputy principal Wang Sen was recruited.

After taking office, Wang Sen immediately began the recruitment of deputy principals and middle-level cadres. He went deep into the masses, advocated democracy, and inspired the sense of ownership among all teachers and staff to actively participate in politics and discuss politics, recommending the best candidates for the new leadership team. During the "principal reception day," more than 30 people actively sought the principal for recommendations and self-recommendations, and more than 40 "best cadre plans" were proposed. Finally, through a public opinion survey, the recruitment of deputy principals and middle-level cadres was completed. The new team has an average age of 38, all with a college education or higher, and are all backbone forces on the front line of teaching, full of vitality and energy.

Rong Baoliang said with satisfaction: Seeing this gratifying change, I think about the difference between the new and old teams. First, the enthusiasm of the recruited and the appointed is different; in the past, it was "I have to do it," and now it is "I want to do it"; in the past, it was that the leader trusted me, and now it is that the masses and the leader trust me, and there is a mass base, and the work has more confidence. Secondly, the appointment system enhances the sense of responsibility of cadres, with term targets and directions for effort; unlike the past appointments, if it doesn't work out, some people say, "I didn't want to come in the first place." Thirdly, it is the young people who have the energy, saying "do it" and doing it, the average age of the newly recruited team is 11 years younger than before. I had some concerns at first, but now I see that it really works. It seems that this reform is successful. In terms of age, I can still work for a few more years, but it is better for young people to come up, and I personally stepped down, but the cause has maintained its youthful vigor.

    选一选，谁来当校长
    ——顺义县42所中学校长招聘记
    王晋堂
    办好一所学校，首先要有一个好的校长。校长如何产生，又如何更新优化，在中小学管理体制改革中已经提到日程上来，并且成为教育行政部门深感棘手的一个问题。
    建国以来，我们的中小学干部实行的主要是委任制，校长由上级任命或委派。这种做法衍用多年，逐渐形成一种固定模式，发挥了一定效用；但随着教育改革的深化，它也因显露出的弊端日益受到挑战。
    改革深化　“相马”术受到挑战
    首先是这种靠上级组织部门慧眼识英才的“相马”做法，受到在公平基础上通过“赛马”选拔人才的改革趋势的冲击；特别在一些风气不正的地方，这种做法成了“说你行你就行，说你不行你就不行”的温床。其次是由于缺乏竞争机制，论资排辈、“任人唯资”盛行，难以使真正有才干的人脱颖而出，学校办得缺少活力。再次是干部任用缺少一个能上能下的流动办法，一些或因年龄较高力不从心或因观念陈旧跟不上改革步伐的干部下不去，实在干不好就换一个地方；有位校长一连换了7个学校，没有一个办好过。校长地位不能变，校长坐着名副其实的“铁交椅”，阻碍了一些学校改变落后面貌。
    从全国各地不断传来向这种僵化模式冲击的信息。
    ——山东昌邑县中小学公开招标选聘校长，198名新校长上任；
    ——昆明市竞选中学校长，到今年3月，已有26所中学产生新校长，占该市中学2／3左右；
    ——湖北省房县民主选举中小学校长，到去年年底，已有309所中小学实行了选聘制，占全县中小学总数43％；……
    北京市顺义县选择了以招聘校长为教育管理体制改革的突破口。今年上半年，全县42所中学校长招聘顺利完成，42位有威信有事业心有开拓精神的校长走马上任，教职工主人翁意识增强，学校呈现一派生机。
    被聘的42位校长中，新上任的有10人，约占1／4，其中4人是原副校长，5人担任过中层干部，1人是教师。由于输入了新鲜血液，全县中学校长的年龄结构和知识结构发生了喜人的变化。42所中学校长平均年龄由50岁下降到46岁；中青年校长所占比例由43％上升到67％；具有大专以上文化程度的比例由55％提高到72％。
    答辩声歇　新校长脱颖而出
    “目前我校教育质量较低，在县里处于落后地位，学生存在厌学弃学现象，你认为主要原因是什么？”
    “你怎样评价我校教师的积极性？”
    “如果你任校长，你将怎样调整学校的领导班子？”
    这是张喜庄中学校长招聘大会上，教师向3位竞选者提出的问题。设在乡政府的会场布置得十分庄重，会场的气氛火爆热烈。县、乡和教育局的领导都出席了会议。3位竞选者发表治校演说后，答辩紧张激烈。
    张喜庄中学原是一所基础较好的学校，但是近两年来，由于校主要领导干部相继病休，学校工作停滞不前。学生中厌学弃学现象较为严重：从初一年级到初三年级，近年流失学生78人，流失率达24％。教职工都有一种落后的压抑感和改革的紧迫感，对选好校长改变学校面貌表现出一种强烈的期望。在乡政府的发动下，一位教师、一位原副校长和一位原副教导主任参加了招聘。经过自荐与推荐、公开答辩、民意测验、广泛听取教职工看法、征求县乡领导意见、反复协商后，确定招聘现年41岁的原副教导主任梁宝煌为校长。梁宝煌在这所学校任教已15年，看着学校工作上不去，教学质量在全县40几所学校中排到第34名，早就感到焦心，他就是憋着这股气儿上任的。上任以后，劲头十足，工作既有魄力又深入细致。老师们对新聘校长觉得“可心”，感到摘掉落后帽子有了盼头。目前，张喜庄中学面貌已有改观，学生流失现象得到控制。老师们把流失的学生一个一个找回来，学习跟不上的给他们补课，力争不甩下一个学生。
    张喜庄中学的招聘，是整个顺义县校长招聘工作的一个缩影。全县42所中学共有52人参加竞选。其中13人属自荐，4人竞选成功；39人为教职工、教代会、学校党支部、乡政府推荐，有1人落选。有的竞选人提出如完不成任期目标，自动扣除全年奖金，有的提出从自己工资中拿出一部分交给学校做为风险抵押金，表达了与学校荣辱与共的决心与气魄。上任的校长普遍具有荣誉感、使命感和危机感。
    招聘伊始　老校长主动让贤
    杨各庄一中老校长荣宝良，是一位主动让贤的典型。
    今年53岁的荣校长，1960年大专毕业后分配到中学任教，迄今已近30年；1970年以后任校长，也有18年的历史。他工作勤勤恳恳兢兢业业，艰苦的工作拖垮了身体，他患了低血钾病。招聘工作一开始，他考虑到校长负责制后要有3年任期目标，权力大了，责任重了，与其带病勉强支撑，何如让较年轻的同志肩负重任？他力荐年轻同志，并找年轻同志谈心，说明自己卸下校长的担子也会全力支持新任校长的工作。经学校工会推荐、全体教师投票民意测验，41岁的原副校长王森被聘。
    王森上任后，立即着手副校长和中层干部的聘任工作。他深入群众，发扬民主，激发全校教工积极参政、议政的主人翁感，自荐或推荐新领导班子的最佳人选。在“校长接待日”里，主动找校长推荐和自荐的有30多人，提出“干部最佳方案”40多份，最后通过民意测验，完成了副校长和中层干部的聘任。新班子平均年龄38岁，都具有大专以上文化程度，都是教学第一线上的骨干力量，充满朝气与活力。
    荣宝良欣慰地说：看到这喜人的变化，我就琢磨新老班子有什么不同。首先，聘任的和任命的劲头儿不一样，过去是“要我干”，现在是“我要干”；过去是领导信任我，现在是群众和领导都信任我，有了群众基础，干工作底气更足。其次，聘任制增强了干部的责任感，有了任期目标、有了努力方向；不像过去任命的，干不好也有的说——“我当初就不愿来”。再次，到底是年轻人有冲劲儿，说干就干，学校新聘班子的平均年龄比过去下降了11岁，我开始还有点顾虑，现在一看还真行。看来这一改革是成功的。从年龄上说我还能再干几年，但年轻人上来更有利，我个人退下来了，但事业保持了青春的朝气。
