Recently, reports on cracking down on corruption in the People's Daily have been increasing.

There is no need to hide the fact that the turmoil and even the counter-revolutionary rebellion that was recently caused by the student protests involved many people. Apart from the influence of international and domestic factors, there were also our own problems, which were related to some of our work mistakes. Otherwise, all the instigation from foreign hostile forces and the incitement from domestic counter-revolutionaries would not have been able to exert their influence. This is what we often say, external factors can only take effect through internal factors. If we talk about internal factors, an important aspect is: the crackdown on corruption has been more talk than action for a long time, and people are very dissatisfied with this. As a result, when someone proposed the slogans of "punishing corrupt officials" and "eliminating corruption" during the turmoil, it received widespread support from society.

After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, some people were concerned that since the anti-corruption slogan had been used by bad elements, the anti-corruption struggle might be affected. This concern is unnecessary. The Party Central Committee is very clear on this issue and has repeatedly emphasized the need to do a few things that will boost morale, one of which is to resolutely crack down on corruption and not to be lenient with wrongdoers.

In recent times, news of cracking down on corruption has been frequently reported from various places, and the momentum is growing. This fully demonstrates the Party's determination. Disasters are bad things, but if handled properly, they can make the relationship between the Party and the people closer, and the Party and the people can understand each other's hearts. Cracking down on corruption is something our Party first proposed. As long as we seriously implement it, we will definitely receive the enthusiastic support of the masses. The Party and the people have the same mind, and the work is done together. No disaster can crush us; instead, we will overcome it.

    惩治腐败要真抓真办
    华军
    最近的人民日报上，有关惩治腐败的报道越来越多。
    不必讳言，不久前由学潮酿成的动乱乃至反革命暴乱，所以有那么多人被卷入，除了有国际大气候和国内小气候的影响外，毕竟还有我们自身的原因，与我们工作中的一些失误有关。否则，一切国外敌对势力的挑唆，国内反革命分子的煽动，都难以施展其能量。这就是我们常说的，外因通过内因才能起作用。要说内因，一个重要方面就是：惩治腐败在很长一段时期，雷声大雨点小，人们对此很是不满，以致当着在动乱中一有人提出“惩办官倒”、“清除腐败”的口号，便得到社会上的广泛响应。
    平息了北京反革命暴乱后，有些人担心，反腐败的口号既然被坏人利用了，反腐败斗争可能会因此受到干扰。这种担心是多余的。党中央在这个问题上十分清醒，一再强调要办几件振奋人心的事情，其中之一就是坚决惩治腐败，决不姑息养奸。
    近期各地惩治腐败的消息频繁传来，声势日见其壮，充分说明了党的决心。灾难是坏事，但处理得当，可以使党和人民的联系更紧密，党和人民心心相印。惩治腐败是我们党首先提出来的，只要真抓真办，就一定会得到群众的热烈拥护。党和人民心想在一起，事办到一块，任何灾难也压不垮我们，而只能被我们战胜。
