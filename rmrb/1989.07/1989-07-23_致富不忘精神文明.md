The village of Dabaishi in Hebei Province's Lixian County has a population of over 4,000. In the past, it was not only poor but also notorious for being a place where "every passing bird loses a feather." If a seller of reeds came, a few strands would be taken; if a seller of potatoes came, a few would be taken as well. Today, Dabaishi Village has not only seen rapid economic development, with a total industrial and agricultural output value of over 70 million yuan last year and an average annual income of 1,800 yuan per person, but it has also been free of criminal cases, feudal superstitions, and gambling or fighting for three years. It has been awarded the title of "Civilized Village" by the Baoding region. The village's transformation is due to its emphasis on both material and spiritual civilization.

In May 1986, 34-year-old demobilized soldier Zhu Zhanliang was elected as the branch secretary. At the branch committee meeting, Zhu proposed the "Fission Reaction Plan" (also known as the "Fission Factory" plan), which involves using the existing three chemical fiber spinning mills as a base. Part of the technical, management, and business personnel, along with funds, would be allocated to mobilize other villagers to invest in new factories. Once the new factories are established, another round of fission would be carried out to develop multiple small enterprises. In three years, Dabaishi Village has built 32 new chemical fiber spinning mills and 120 trading depots, in addition to the original three old mills. The fixed assets have reached 235 million yuan, with over 8,000 employees (including nearly 5,000 from other villages), forming a production base with a daily output of over 20 tons of chemical fiber yarn. From 1986 to 1988, the village paid 3.89 million yuan in taxes to the state.

While developing the commodity economy, the village party branch has focused on strengthening party democracy and decision-making. They educate party members to fulfill their duties while respecting their rights. The five party branches under their jurisdiction have maintained the "three meetings and one class" system over the past three years, continuously improving the quality of party members.

During this year's summer grain procurement, the party members of Dabaishi Village not only led the way in delivering grain but also helped households push, pull, carry, and lift. The 230,000 jin procurement task was completed in two days. The village also invested 5.2 million yuan to build a teaching building for the school, 3.2 million yuan to build a cinema, and 1.5 million yuan to build a nursing home. Most of the funds were donated by the villagers, led by the party members.

Currently, the village excels in family planning, poverty alleviation, honesty, and timely tax payments, among other areas, with good deeds emerging constantly. On July 1st of this year, led by the party members, the village paid 1.5 million yuan in individual income adjustment tax in one day. Since last year, in the "Branch Upgrade, Party Members Excel" activity across the district, the village party branch was rated as an advanced party organization, and 47 party members were rated as outstanding party members.

    致富不忘精神文明
    河北省蠡县大百尺村，拥有4000多口人，过去不但穷，而且人称“惹不起”，是个雁过拔毛的地方：去个卖苇子的，要抽人家几绺；去个卖土豆的，也要拿人家几个。如今，大百尺村不仅经济得到迅速发展，去年全村工农业总产值达到7000多万元，人均年收入1800元；而且该村3年无刑事案件发生，无封建迷信活动，无赌博打架现象，被保定地区授予“文明村”等称号。该村的变化如此之大，靠的就是两个文明一起抓。
    1986年5月，34岁的复员军人朱占良当选为总支书记。朱占良在支委会上提出了“裂变反应计划”（亦称裂变建厂），即利用已有的3个化纤毛纺厂做基础，从中分出部分技术、管理、业务人员和资金，动员其他村民入股，建设新厂。待新厂成熟后，再实行新的裂变，以发展多家小型企业而取胜。3年时间，大百尺村共新建化纤毛纺厂32个，经销货栈120个，加上原来的3个老厂，固定资产已达到2.35亿元，从业人员8000多人（吸收近5000外乡人），已经形成日产20多吨化纤毛线的生产基地。1986年至1988年，该村向国家上缴利税389万元。
    在发展商品经济的同时，大百尺村党总支重视加强党内民主制度建设，努力实行决策民主化。他们既教育党员认真履行义务，又充分尊重党员的权利。所辖的5个党支部3年来坚持了“三会一课”制度，不断提高党员的素质。
    在今年的夏粮征购中，大百尺村的党员们除带头交粮外，还分头到各户，帮助群众推、拉、抬、扛，23万斤征购任务，两天就完成了，该村还投资52万元为学校兴建教学楼，投资32万元兴建影剧院，投资15万元兴建敬老院，其中资金大部分是在党员们的带动下，由全村群众捐献的。
    目前，这个村在实行计划生育、扶贫助难、拾金不昧、积极交纳税款等等方面，好人好事层出不穷。今年7月1日这天，在党员们的带动下，该村一天就上交个人收入调节税15万元。去年以来，在全区开展的“支部升级党员争优”活动中，村党总支被评为先进党组织，有47名党员被评为优秀党员。
