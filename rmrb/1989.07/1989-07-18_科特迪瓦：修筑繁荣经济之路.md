During my time reporting in African countries, one of the most striking impressions I had was of Côte d'Ivoire's emphasis on road construction and its excellent road infrastructure.

In 1960, Côte d'Ivoire had only 700 kilometers of asphalt roads, but this has since increased to 5,500 kilometers, including 140 kilometers of expressways. The gravel roads have also expanded from 25,000 kilometers to 60,000 kilometers. In recent years, despite facing severe economic difficulties and a temporary slowdown in various construction projects, road building has never stopped, and in fact, it has accelerated significantly compared to the economic boom of the 1970s. For instance, in 1988, the country built 600 kilometers of new roads. Advertisements for tenders and announcements of completed projects frequently appear in newspapers, and new roads are constantly being added to the map of Côte d'Ivoire.

The roads in Côte d'Ivoire are well-built and aesthetically pleasing, earning praise from all foreign visitors. The Descartes Boulevard in Abidjan can rival the Champs-Élysées in Paris, and the tree-lined avenues in Yamoussoukro are as wide as Beijing's Chang'an Street. The country not only excels in urban road construction but also in rural roads. Now, a national road network has been established, connecting the north, south, east, and west, making travel extremely convenient. Journeys that once took a day or two can now be completed in just a few hours.

Côte d'Ivoire's development of transportation infrastructure has several notable features:

First, it invests heavily in this sector. The country allocates over 30% of its equipment and special investment budget annually to road construction. To implement the second (1985-1988) and third (1988-1991) road development plans, which aim to build 2,100 kilometers of roads in the interior, the government has secured 150 billion West African CFA francs (approximately $500 million) in loans from the World Bank and the African Development Bank.

Second, it emphasizes planning. The guiding principle for developing road infrastructure is to break the isolation of any region, achieving balanced and coordinated development across the country. There are both overall plans and phased schedules. The country first focused on building roads in the southern and eastern regions, which are the main cocoa and coffee-producing areas, crucial to the national economy. The network of roads ensures the collection and export of agricultural products. Subsequently, the focus shifted to the northern and western regions. The north is a base for cotton, livestock, and sugar industries and a transportation hub to neighboring countries. The west is a new cocoa and coffee-producing region, and the completion of the road from the western border town of Man to the southern port of San Pedro has solved the problem of exporting agricultural products from this area. The third development plan prioritizes the construction of a coastal highway in the southwest to connect the coastal route from Ghana to Côte d'Ivoire and then to Liberia. This highway will be highly beneficial for the development of local industry and agriculture, as well as the tourism industry.

Third, it values the training of engineering and technical personnel. Building good roads at a reasonable cost often depends on three factors: the quality of materials, design quality, and management level. All these aspects require a large number of experienced engineering and technical personnel, as well as managers. The country's large public works department has gathered many such specialists to implement the national road development plan. The National Higher School of Public Works is a cradle for training road engineering and technical personnel, graduating a new batch of students each year.

Côte d'Ivoire's road construction is a crucial lever for the development of urban and rural economies, thus receiving widespread support and welcome. Many farmers do not demand compensation from the state for farmland and houses damaged during road construction. The country's roads also benefit several landlocked countries in the north. I often see large trucks from Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger parked near the port of Abidjan. Côte d'Ivoire's road construction undoubtedly plays a significant role in promoting economic prosperity.

### 科特迪瓦：修筑繁荣经济之路

    科特迪瓦：修筑繁荣经济之路
    本报记者　杨汝生
    在非洲国家采访时，给记者留下的深刻印象是，科特迪瓦是非常重视筑路、也是公路设施最好的国家之一。
    1960年，科特迪瓦只有沥青路700公里，现已增加到5500公里，其中高速公路140公里；卵石路面也从原来的25000公里增至60000公里。近几年，科遇到严重的经济困难，各项建设事业暂时处于紧缩状态，可修路一天也没有停止过，甚至大大超过经济大发展的70年代。例如它1988年就修了600公里的路。招标广告屡见报端，竣工消息不断传来，一条又一条新路划上科特迪瓦的地图。
    科特迪瓦的路修得标准、漂亮，凡是来访的外国人无不交口称赞。阿比让的德斯坦大道可与巴黎的香榭丽舍大街媲美；亚穆苏克罗的林荫道同北京的东西长安街一样宽广。它不仅城市道路修得好，乡村道路也不错。现在，全国已初步形成一个公路交通网，从南到北，从东到西，四通八达，方便极了。过去需要一两天的路程，而今几小时就够了。
    科特迪瓦发展交通事业有以下几个特点：
    一、舍得花钱。科特迪瓦用于此项的开支每年都占装备和特别投资预算的30％以上。为了实现第二个（1985—1988）和第三个（1988—1991）公路发展计划，即在内地修筑2100公里的道路，科政府已从世界银行和非洲开发银行那里筹集到1500亿西非法郎（约合5亿美元）的贷款。
    二、规划性强。科发展公路事业的指导思想是打破任何一个地区的封闭状态，以实现全国城乡均衡协调的发展。既有整体规划，又有分期计划。它首先在南部和东部地区修建了公路，因为这里是主要的可可、咖啡产区，关系到国家的经济命脉，纵横交叉的公路网保证了农产品的收购和外运。它继而把修路的重点转向北部和西部。北部是棉花、畜牧业和榨糖业基地，又是通向邻近国家的交通枢纽。西部是新兴的可可、咖啡产区，从西部边陲芒城到南部港口圣·彼德罗道路的打通解决了该地农产品外运的问题。第三个发展计划的重点是在西南部修建一条滨海公路，以便沟通从加纳往科特迪瓦直到利比里亚的沿海通道。这条公路不论对发展当地的工农业生产，还是对发展旅游事业都是大有裨益的。
    三、重视工程技术人员的培养。路要修得好，又要省钱，往往取决于以下3个条件：材料好坏，设计质量和管理水平。这些事都要有大批有经验的工程技术人员和管理人员去做。科大型公共工程局荟萃了许多这样的专门人才，负责实施国家的公路发展计划。全国高等公共工程学校是培养筑路工程技术人员的摇篮，每年都有一批学生毕业。
    科特迪瓦的公路建设是城乡经济发展的“重要杠杆”，因而受到人们的广泛欢迎和支持。许多农民对筑路过程中毁坏的农田和房屋都主动不让国家赔偿。科的公路还可造福于北部的几个内陆国家，记者经常看到，在阿比让港口附近停放着一片片马里、布基纳法索和尼日尔的大卡车。科特迪瓦的公路建设对繁荣经济无疑是一个巨大的促进。
