China's national patent literature museum, the China Patent Literature Museum, opened today in Beijing.

This is a vast repository of knowledge and a valuable source of scientific and technological information. It houses over 10 million patent specifications from 16 countries, including China, the United States, Britain, Japan, and others, as well as the European Patent Office and the Patent Cooperation Treaty Organization. Additionally, it collects patent gazettes and other patent literature from more than 20 countries.

Patent literature combines technical information, legal information, and economic information. It disseminates new technologies and inventions in a novel, rapid, and detailed manner, promoting the advancement of science and technology. Statistics show that about 90% of the new inventions reflected in global patent literature each year cannot be found in other scientific and technological resources. The greatest value of patent literature is that it facilitates the entry of research achievements and inventions into the market, serving as an important reference for research and foreign trade departments.

    这是一个庞大的知识仓库和宝贵的科技情报源。它共收藏有中、美、英、日本等16个国家，以及欧洲专利局和专利合作条约组织的1000多万件专利说明书，还收藏了20多个国家的专利公报和其他专利文献资料。
    专利文献集技术信息、法律信息和经济信息于一身。它以新颖、迅速、详尽的特点传播新技术新发明，促进科学技术的进步。据统计，全世界每年专利文献反映的新发明，约有90％是其他科技资料中无法见到的。专利文献最大的作用是使科研成果和发明创造进入市场，是科研和外贸部门重要的参考资料。
