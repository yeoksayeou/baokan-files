The last coal-oil navigation light on the Yangtze River has recently been replaced by a brand-new modern solar-powered navigation light.

This marks the end of a century-long history of the Yangtze River relying on coal-oil navigation lights for guidance.

The last coal-oil lamp that was replaced is located on the navigation channel of Anqing Dangjiang Ji in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This section of the channel is shallow and dangerous, with numerous rocks and rapid currents. For over a century, someone has been responsible for lighting and refueling the lamp daily without interruption. The newly installed solar-powered navigation light not only increases the brightness by about five times compared to the original coal-oil lamp, making it more visible, but also significantly reduces the workload of the channel workers and improves work efficiency.

    长江上最后一盏航标油灯退役
    新华社武汉7月1日电　（通讯员江玉樵）长江上最后一盏煤油航标灯，已于最近被一崭新的现代化太阳能导航灯所取代。
    这标志着万里长江百余年来靠煤油航标灯导航的历史宣告结束。
    被替换掉的最后这盏煤油灯设置在长江下游的安庆拦江矶的航道上。这段航道是浅险水道，江面上礁石林立，水流湍急。百余年来，每天有人按时点灯加油，从未间断。新设置的太阳能导航灯，不仅光亮度比原煤油灯提高5倍左右，视见度强，而且还大大减轻了航道工人的劳动强度，提高了工作效率。
