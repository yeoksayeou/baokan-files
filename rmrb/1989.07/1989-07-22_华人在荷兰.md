There are an estimated 45,000 Chinese people in the Netherlands. Most of them are from Fujian province and have already become Dutch citizens. About half of them migrated from Indonesia after 1966, and they can obtain local citizenship after living in the Netherlands for five years.

Chinese people are concentrated in cities like Amsterdam and Amstelveen, with several thousand in each. The rest are scattered across the country, mainly working in the restaurant industry. There are approximately 3,000 Chinese professionals, some of whom have achieved notable success. For example, the design of Amsterdam Airport was done by the Chinese architect Gao Liangying, who migrated from Indonesia in the 1960s. His furniture designs are also popular among locals. Chinese people also have extensive experience in business and foreign trade, and many Chinese students are top performers in their studies.

The Netherlands is a country with high social welfare. Chinese people in the Netherlands, like the locals, enjoy a secure life and good treatment.

Chinese community organizations are generally small in scale. For instance, the Creative Society in Leiden has 500 members and publishes a newsletter. The Dutch Friendship Association only accepts Indonesian Chinese immigrants and has over 100 members. The number of members in the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Eindhoven is also small.

The Creative Society newsletter categorizes Chinese people in the Netherlands into three age groups. Those over 60 years old mostly received Chinese education or were deeply influenced by Chinese culture, and most still consider themselves Chinese, having a deep affection for China. Those around 40 years old mostly did not receive Chinese education but have some understanding and affection for China. Those around 20 years old were all born in the Netherlands and have a weaker connection to China, but they know their ancestors came from China. Some of them, influenced by their family education, also hope to visit China to trace their roots.

In the Netherlands, there is no school that teaches exclusively in Chinese. Most Chinese students learn Chinese in supplementary classes.

    华人在荷兰
    荷兰华人估计为4.5万人。多数祖籍福建，且已加入荷籍。其中一半是1966年以后从印尼移居去的华人，在荷兰定居5年后可以取得当地国籍。
    华人比较集中的城市是阿姆斯特尔芬和阿姆斯特丹，各有几千人，其余散居各地，他们从事餐馆业。华人专业人员约有3000人，一些人成绩显著。如阿姆斯特丹机场是华人高良英所设计。他是60年代从印尼迁来的建筑师，他设计的家具也很受当地人欢迎。华人在商业、外贸经营方面也富有经验，许多华人学生成绩名列前茅。
    荷兰是高福利国家，荷兰华人和当地人一样，生活有保障，待遇较好。
    华人社团一般规模较小。例如，里斯威克的创造社团有500个会员，出版会刊。荷兰友联社只接受印尼华人移民，只有100多会员。埃因霍温华裔商会人数也很少。
    创造社团会刊按年龄把荷兰华人分成3个层次。60岁以上者多数受过中文教育或受中国文化影响较深，多数仍认为自己是中国人，对中国感情较深。40岁左右者多数未受中文教育，但对中国有一定了解，也有一定感情。20岁左右者都在当地出生，对中国感情淡薄，但知道祖辈家乡在中国，有些人受家庭教育影响，也希望能到中国寻根。
    在荷兰，没有一所专门用中文讲课的中文学校，一些华人学生多数是在补习班里学习中文的。
