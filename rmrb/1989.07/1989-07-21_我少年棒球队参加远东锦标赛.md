A youth baseball team from Chengdu's Jinniu District, consisting of 18 members, departed Chengdu by plane today to head to Seoul. They will represent China in the Far East Zone Championship of the International Youth Baseball Association, which is being held in South Korea.

The Jinniu District Youth Baseball Team of Chengdu was established in 1983. Under the guidance of Coach Zhu Mingde, the team has made rapid progress and achieved outstanding results, consistently ranking at the top in domestic competitions among peers in recent years. In December last year, they competed against a visiting Japanese youth baseball team and achieved a commendable record of 3 wins and 1 loss. Therefore, the State Sports Commission decided that the Jinniu District Youth Baseball Team of Chengdu would represent the Chinese youth team to participate in the competition in Seoul.

This competition will be held from July 24 to 30 in Seoul, with 8 teams from China, Chinese Taipei, the United States, Canada, Japan, and other countries participating.

    我少年棒球队参加远东锦标赛
    新华社成都7月21日电  （记者王文俊）成都市金牛区少年棒球队一行18人，今天乘飞机离开成都赴汉城，代表中国参加在南朝鲜举行的国际少年棒球联盟远东区锦标赛。
    成都市金牛区少年棒球队是1983年成立的。这个队在朱明德教练的指导下，进步较快、成绩突出，在近几年的国内同龄组比赛中名列前茅。去年12月迎战来访的日本少年棒球队，取得3胜1负的较好成绩。因此，国家体委决定由成都市金牛区少年棒球队代表中国少年队赴汉城参赛。
    这次比赛于7月24日至30日在汉城举行，有中国、中国台北、美国、加拿大、日本等8支球队参加。
