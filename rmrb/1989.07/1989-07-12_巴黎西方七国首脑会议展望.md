At the western end of the central axis from the Louvre Museum, the Place de la Concorde to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, a giant gate-shaped structure stands tall. This building, which the French call the "Window to the World," will welcome its first guests, the leaders attending the 15th Summit of the Seven Western Nations to be held from July 14 to 16.

The annual summit, which has a consistent yet slightly varying agenda, will focus on several key issues this year. Observers believe the main topics will include economic cooperation and development, third-world debt, and environmental protection.

Last year was relatively normal for the economic development of Western countries, with growth rates increasing from 3.4% in 1987 to 4.2% in 1988. Unemployment and inflation rates remained relatively stable. However, in some countries, inflationary trends are still concerning, with an average growth rate of 4.5%. Therefore, controlling inflation and maintaining stable economic growth are issues of universal concern. It is reported that President Bush has declared that the goal of the Paris meeting is to achieve economic growth without inflation. Coordinating economic policies also includes currency exchange rates. In recent months, exchange rates have been quite unstable, with the dollar fluctuating by up to 15%. Although Western countries have become accustomed to fluctuations in the currency market, they still hope to strengthen cooperation in this area. The Louvre Accord of February 1987 had set regulations for the fluctuation of the dollar, yen, and mark. This time, some countries have suggested concluding a foreign exchange agreement within the international monetary system to intervene in the currency market when necessary, while others do not support excessive intervention. Due to these differences, it is estimated that this summit can only reach a "low-key" agreement. However, since Western European countries advocate for the progress of the European Monetary Union through stable exchange rates and monetary cooperation, and France has a relatively positive attitude towards the European Monetary Union, observers here point out that it is worth noting whether France will propose new suggestions regarding exchange rates.

This summit will focus on the debt issues of the third world. The widening gap between the rich and poor in the North-South divide is unfavorable for the economic development of the world, including the West. Developed countries have successively introduced the Mitterrand Plan (France), Miyazawa Plan (Japan), and Brady Plan (USA), all of which propose debt relief and long-term solutions to the debt crisis. In recent months, based on these plans, relevant parties have been actively discussing to determine principles for reducing the debt of poor third-world countries and mechanisms to protect the interests of capital and creditor countries. It is expected that a plan will emerge: the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank will provide some funds, and debtors will repay their debts at a discount. It is said that the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have already raised $20 billion, and Japan will also generously contribute. This plan may be approved at this summit, but there may be debates over the "discount" ratio. It is generally believed that regardless of the debates over the plans and resolutions, the issue of debt relief for poor third-world countries cannot be delayed any longer. The fact that massive debts lead to stagnant production, inflation, and social unrest in poor countries is evident. Before the summit, crowds gathered in Paris at the Place de la Bastille for a rally and march, with one of the slogans being to promote North-South dialogue and cancel the debts of third-world countries, reflecting the widespread dissatisfaction of the masses with the long-standing debt issue that has not been resolved.

Environmental protection is also a major issue to be discussed at this summit. In the past, only West Germany and Canada had strong voices, but they did not attract widespread attention. In recent years, especially in the June European Parliament elections, ecological organizations and green parties have rapidly risen, indicating that environmental protection has become a concern for all countries. Bush expressed his hope that the Paris summit will become a "historic meeting" on environmental issues. In principle, Western leaders will not object to this, but they may have difficulties coordinating specific understandings and economic investments. Each country hopes to prioritize solving various problems, such as protecting the ozone layer, limiting carbon dioxide emissions, stopping river, sea, and ocean pollution, and protecting tropical forests. France will also raise the issue of the relationship between environmental protection and economic development at the meeting, emphasizing financial and technological assistance to developing countries to help them maintain ecological balance.

Since 1975, the leaders of Western developed economies have held annual summits in rotation. This year marks the beginning of the third cycle. The summit initially focused on addressing the capitalist economic crisis, then developed into coordinating economic policies, and later gradually entered the political arena, with East-West relations being a frequent topic of discussion. The issues the summit aims to address seem to be increasing, but the problems it can solve are limited.

    巴黎西方七国首脑会议展望
    本报记者　吕网大
    在巴黎卢浮宫、协和广场至凯旋门的中轴线西端，耸立起了一座巨大的门型建筑。这座被法国人称为“世界窗口”的建筑物迎来的第一批客人将是出席本月14日至16日召开的第15届西方7国首脑会议的领导人。
    年年召开的内容划一而又不尽相同的7国首脑“碰头会”今年的议题将是什么？此间的观察家认为，会议探讨的主要问题有：经济合作与发展，第三世界债务和环境保护。
    去年是西方国家经济发展较正常的一年，增长速度由1987年的3.4％上升到去年的4.2％，失业率及通货膨胀率保持了相对的稳定。但是，在一些国家里，通货膨胀的势头仍令人担忧，平均增长率为4.5％。因此，如何制止通货膨胀，维持较稳定的发展速度，是与会者普遍关心的问题。据报道，布什总统已宣称，巴黎会议的目标是维持没有通货膨胀的经济增长。经济政策的协调还包括汇率问题。近几个月来，汇率很不稳定，美元上下浮动的幅度达15％。虽然西方国家对货币市场的波动已习以为常，但仍期待着加强在这个领域的合作。1987年2月的卢浮宫协议曾对美元、日元和马克这三大货币的汇率波动幅度作过规定。此次，有国家建议在国际货币体系中缔结一项外汇兑换协议，必要时对货币市场进行干预，而有的国家不赞成过分的干预。由于存在分歧，估计这次会议只能达成一项“低调”的协议。不过，由于西欧国家主张通过汇率的稳定及货币的合作推进欧洲货币联盟的进展，法国对欧洲货币联盟的态度较积极，所以，此间观察家指出，届时法国会不会提出汇率方面的新建议，值得注意。
    本届首脑会议将重点探讨第三世界的债务问题。南北间日益悬殊的贫富差距，对包括西方在内的世界经济发展是很不利的。发达国家近年已先后推出密特朗计划（法国）、宫泽计划（日本）和布雷迪计划（美国），这些计划都提出了减免债务、长期克服债务危机的方案。近几个月，在这些计划的基础上，有关方面正在积极酝酿，以确定一项减轻第三世界贫穷国家债务的原则和保护资本和债权国利益的机制，人们预料会出现这样一种方案：由国际货币基金组织和世界银行拿出一部分资金，债务国以折扣偿还他们所欠的债务。据说，国际货币基金组织与世界银行已筹集了200亿美元，日本也将慷慨解囊。这一方案有可能在本届会议上获得通过，但在“折扣”的比例问题上，也许会有一场争论。此间普遍认为，不管对计划、决议有什么样的争论，从总体上说，减免第三世界贫穷国家的债务问题不能再拖了。巨额债务导致贫穷国家生产停滞、通货膨胀及社会动荡，这是有目共睹的事实，会前，巴黎群众在巴士底广场集会游行，人们的口号之一即开展南北对话，取消第三世界国家债务，这反映了广大群众对遗留多年而迟迟得不到解决的债务问题不满情绪。
    环境保护也是本届会议将要讨论的主要问题。过去，只有西德、加拿大的呼声高，但并未引起普遍的关注。近年来，特别是今年6月在欧洲议会选举中，生态组织、绿党迅速崛起，表明环境保护成为各国所关心的问题。布什表示，他希望在环境问题上，巴黎会议成为“历史性会议”。原则上西方领导人对此都不会有异议，但在具体的认识和经济投入上，他们之间也许难以协调。各国希望优先解决的问题很多，如保护臭氧层、限制二氧化碳排放、制止江河海洋污染、保护热带森林等。法国还将在会议上提出环境保护和经济发展的关系问题，强调从财政上、技术上援助发展中国家，供其保持生态平衡。
    从1975年起，西方经济发达国家的首脑每年轮流坐庄聚会一次，今年是第三轮的开始。七国首脑会议先以对付资本主义经济危机为题，之后发展到共同协调经济政策，后来又逐渐进入了政治领域，东西方关系问题是经常讨论的议题之一。首脑会议要讨论的问题似乎越来越多，然而它所能解决的问题却是有限的。
