The Hong Kong *Sing Tao Daily* yesterday published a transcript of Governor Wilson's interview with reporters from the newspaper, in which he discussed issues related to Hong Kong's relationship with mainland China, the Basic Law, and Hong Kong's long-term development.

Wilson believes that Hong Kong's economic and trade relations with the Guangdong region will remain unchanged. Maintaining its role as a trading entrepôt for Guangdong and other parts of Asia, and preserving its status as an international financial center, are crucial for Hong Kong's future. He also mentioned that Hong Kong residents should not overly involve themselves in mainland affairs. Hong Kong's existence depends on mutual non-interference with mainland China. While Hong Kong residents do not want excessive interference from China, mainland China also does not want to be disturbed by Hong Kong residents.

Regarding Hong Kong's economic development, Wilson believes that a short-sighted approach is not viable. Long-term development must continue, not just focusing on whether to build a new airport, but also on constructing a vast road network and large-scale sewage systems to improve environmental hygiene.

    港督卫奕信谈香港问题
    新华社香港7月28日电　香港《信报》昨天发表了港督卫奕信在接受这家报纸记者采访时，就有关香港与内地的关系、香港基本法、香港的长远建设等问题的谈话。
    卫奕信认为，香港与华南地区的经贸关系将会维持不变。能够保持作为华南地区和亚洲其它地区的贸易转口站，能够维持作为国际金融中心的地位，都是保障香港未来的关键。他还提到，香港人不能过分介入大陆的事务，香港的存在实在有赖于与中国大陆的互不冒犯，香港人固然不希望受到中国的过分干预，中国大陆当然也不希望被港人滋扰。
    关于香港的经济建设，卫奕信认为，不能短视，必须继续从事长远发展，不光着眼于是否兴建新机场，而是继续兴建庞大的道路网，建设改善环境卫生的大规模污水系统。
