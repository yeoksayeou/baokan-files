Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 9th.

Beijing in June, after the wind and rain, is lush and green. The troops stationed here to enforce martial law have won the understanding and trust of the people with their strict discipline and civilized conduct. Their deep affection for the people of the capital is as profound as the verdant greenery that covers the city.

“Fighting the invaders, resisting the bandits, aiding Korea, resisting Vietnam, our fathers are invincible. Protecting the capital, loving the people, carrying rifles and enduring beatings, our sons do not retaliate.” This couplet hangs at the entrance of a certain unit of the martial law troops.

This unit, established in 1931 as a Red Army unit, received orders on the afternoon of June 3 at 5 PM to march from Nanyuan Airport into the city. They encountered a small number of rioters and misinformed civilians who blocked their way. Despite the soldiers chanting “Love the capital” and “Love the people of the capital” in unison, stones, soda bottles, wooden sticks, and iron bars rained down on them. Many soldiers' clothes were torn, and even their helmets were smashed. Within half an hour of setting out, a batch of wounded soldiers had already been carried back. It took seven hours to cover a distance of ten kilometers, and by the time they reached their positions, thousands of soldiers were almost all injured. Some were beaten unconscious, and others would be permanently disabled. Sergeant Peng Xiang'an of the Special Operations Company was pulled out of the formation by a group of people. He did not fight back and was beaten to the ground. He stood up again but still did not fight back. Until he was struck in the spine with an iron rod and could no longer stand, he never fought back. The soldiers said, “Even if my parents beat me like this at home, I wouldn't stand for it; but here, most of them are misinformed civilians!”

What fine soldiers they are! Facing the insults and beatings of the misinformed civilians, they endured it. Watching their beloved comrades fall one by one, they endured it. But when representatives from various sectors came to visit them, they shed tears of manhood.

By nightfall, Long'an Street was bustling with traffic, and the shopping crowds in the commercial districts were thronging. Couples strolled hand in hand in the parks and along the tree-lined avenues... It was the deep affection of the soldiers that dispelled the doubts in the people's hearts, making the capital's night, which had just experienced the counter-revolutionary riot, so warm and peaceful, and the lives of the citizens so tranquil.

On the morning of June 4, a certain "Red Army Regiment" entered the Jianwai Bridge to enforce martial law. Many civilians, still harboring doubts, surrounded the soldiers on duty at the bridge, asking questions. Suddenly, it started to rain, but the people were reluctant to leave. The soldiers immediately ran to the vehicles and brought out 70-plus raincoats to distribute to the civilians, while they stood in the rain themselves.

The camp of a certain "Red Army Regiment" was set up next to an open-air dance hall. The soldiers could reach the dance hall's fence without leaving their tents. The dance hall had ceased operations during the riot. After the riot was suppressed, the dance hall manager wanted to resume operations but was worried about disturbing the soldiers' rest. Just as they were at a loss, the unit leaders found them and said, “Go ahead and dance. The soldiers' snores can accompany the sound of guns, so what's to fear about the dance music?”

The dance hall reopened. As the lights came on, the dance music blended with laughter and chatter, filling every tent. The soldiers stood guard and attended meetings as usual. The difference was that the soldiers rarely went outside the tents anymore, and they closed the “doors” and “windows” of the tents tightly. They were concerned that their appearance might disrupt the special atmosphere of the dance hall; they were worried that their scant clothing might affect the image of the army. In fact, there were no few “dance masters” among the soldiers.

On the afternoon of June 4, the burned military vehicles were still smoking, and hundreds of soldiers from a certain unit took to the streets to clear the barricades. They braved the danger and the scorching heat, working an entire afternoon to clear all the barricades from the East Gate of the Temple of Heaven to Chongwenmen. Once, 30 soldiers participated in a community service project and were invited into a unit's bathhouse to shower. When the soldiers took off their clothes, the staff discovered that everyone had bruises from being beaten. They moved, saying, “The PLA is truly the people's good sons!”

Soldier Song Chengwen unfortunately had stomach cancer, with three-quarters of his stomach removed. On May 20, when the unit received orders to go to Beijing to enforce martial law, Xiao Song was in the hospital receiving treatment. On June 2, he finally found an excuse to “persuade” his way out of the hospital and made his way to Beijing alone, finding his unit. The leaders, seeing his gaunt cheeks, ordered him to return, but Xiao Song pleaded with tears, “I love a beautiful life, but I love my great motherland even more.”

The stomach pain made him dizzy and nauseous, but he endured it and persisted with his comrades in drills, sentry duty, and community service. On June 15, Xiao Song went with his unit to Chaoyang District for community service. Just as he was working enthusiastically, his stomach pain flared up, and his forehead was covered in beads of sweat. He swallowed several pills, but the pain did not subside. The onlookers, learning that he had cancer, insisted that he stop working. Xiao Song pleaded, “My time is limited. Please let me do more for the capital!”

This is our army, these are our soldiers. The merits they have established and the deep affection they have shown on this extraordinary page of the republic's history will forever be etched in the hearts of the people.

    情洒京都
    ——戒严部队遵纪爱民散记
    新华社记者　曹国强　陈焱
    六月的北京，风过雨霁，万木葱茏。在这里执行戒严任务的部队官兵以严明的军纪，文明的举止，赢得了群众的理解和信任。他们对首都人民的殷殷深情，浓得正像这满城绿翳。
    （一）
    “抗日寇打蒋匪援朝抗越老子无坚不摧，卫首都爱人民荷枪挨打儿子一拳不还。”这是戒严部队某部驻地营门前的一副对联。
    这个1931年成立的红军部队，6月3日下午5时，奉命从南苑机场向城里进发，遇到少数暴徒和不明真相的群众阻拦。尽管战士们排着队，齐声高喊“热爱首都”、“热爱首都人民”的口号，但石块、汽水瓶、木棍和铁棒还是雨点般袭来。许多战士的衣服被撕破，甚至连钢盔都被砸裂了。出发仅半小时，一批伤员就被抬了回来。十几公里路走了7个小时，到达就位点时，数千官兵几乎人人负了伤。有的被打得昏迷不醒，有的将成为终生残废。特务连排长彭湘安被一伙人从队伍中拉出来，他没还手，被打倒在地，他又爬起来，仍没还手；直至被一根铁棍打断脊椎骨，他再也没爬起来。战士们说：“要在家，爹妈这么打我，我都不干；只是眼前多是不明真相的群众啊！”
    多么好的战士啊！面对不明真相群众的辱骂、殴打，他们忍住了。眼看着亲爱的战友一个个倒下，他们也忍住了。但当各界人士前来慰问时，他们淌下了男儿泪。
    （二）
    入夜，长安街上车水马龙，繁华商业区购物人群熙熙攘攘，街心花园、林荫道上对对情侣相伴依依……正是子弟兵的殷殷深情，拂去了群众心头的疑云，刚刚经历了反革命暴乱的首都夜晚才有这般温馨，市民的生活才这般安宁。
    6月4日上午，某“红军团”进入建国门立交桥执行戒严任务时，许多疑云未散的群众把在桥上执勤的官兵团团围住，问这问那。突然天下起雨来，人们仍不愿散去。官兵们立即跑到车上抱来70多件雨衣分发给群众，他们自己却站在雨里。
    某部“红军团”的宿营地就在一座露天舞场旁，战士们不出帐篷就能摸到舞场的围栏。暴乱中，舞场停止了营业。暴乱平息后，舞场负责人想恢复营业，但又怕影响官兵们休息。正为难时，部队领导找到他们，说：“跳吧，战士们的鼾声能和枪炮声合奏，还怕这舞乐不成？”
    舞场又营业了。华灯初上，舞乐合着欢声笑语，传遍座座帐篷。官兵们照常站岗执勤，学习开会。与往常不同的是官兵们很少到帐篷外去了，而且把帐篷的“门”、“窗”关了个严严实实。他们担心自己的出现会破坏舞场那特别的气氛；担心自己穿着太少会影响军队的形象。其实，官兵中“舞林高手”并不少。
    （三）
    6月4日下午，被烧毁的军车还冒着浓烟，某部数百名官兵就走上街头清理路障。他们冒着危险与酷暑，干了一下午，将天坛东门至崇文门的路障全部清除。一次，30名官兵参加助民劳动后，被请进一个单位的浴池洗澡。当官兵们脱去衣服后，工作人员发现，人人身上都有被打伤的痕迹。他们感动地说：“解放军不愧是人民的好子弟啊！”
    某部战士宋承文不幸患了胃癌，胃被切除3／4。5月20日部队接到赴京执行戒严任务时，小宋正在医院接受治疗。6月2日，他终于找借口“磨”出医院，只身赶到北京，找到了部队。领导望着他瘦削的面颊，命令他回去，小宋含泪请求道：“我热爱美好的人生，但我更爱伟大的祖国。”
    胃痛折磨得他头晕眼花，但他忍着坚持和战友们一起出操、站岗、参加助民劳动。6月15日，小宋随部队到朝阳区参加助民劳动，正干得欢时，胃痛发作了，额头上布满豆大的汗珠，他一连几次把药片吞下，仍未能止住。在场的群众得知他患着癌症，说什么也不让他干了。小宋却恳求说：“我的时间不多了，请让我再多为首都做点事情吧！”
    这就是我们的军队，这就是我们的战士，他们在共和国这页非凡的历史上建树的功勋，洒下的深情，将永远铭刻在人民心中。
