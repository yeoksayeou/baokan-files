Title: Criticism Published in Newspaper for Over a Year, Responsible Parties Unpunished

The Kunluo Line Yangwu section of the highway in Yunnan, with an investment of over 900 million yuan, was constructed with substandard materials and poor workmanship. Within half a month of its opening, the road was riddled with potholes and unusable, with road surface damages alone amounting to over 120 million yuan.

After your newspaper published the letter to the editor titled "900 Million Yuan Newly Built Highway—Riddled with Potholes Within Half a Month" on the fifth page on October 17, 1987, more than a year has passed, and the provincial highway bureau's deputy director Yang Jiugao, who oversaw the acceptance of this project, has not been held accountable. The provincial highway bureau's deputy chief engineer Lan Guangjian, who was in charge of this section during construction, has also not been properly investigated. The deputy director of the provincial transportation department, who is responsible for highway construction, has not taken any responsibility.

If such a major case remains unaddressed, even if there are many suggestion boxes set up, it is in vain. How can we talk about rectifying the party's style?

    登报批评一年多  责任者未受处理
    云南昆洛线杨武一段公路，投资900多万元。有关人员在施工中，偷工减料、粗制滥造，通车半个月就千疮百孔，不堪使用，仅路面损失就达120多万元。
    1987年10月17日你报第五版刊登了《900万元新建公路　半个多月百孔千疮》的读者来信后，一年多过去了，主持验收这一工程的省公路局杨九皋副局长却未损一根毫毛。施工中分管此段公路的省公路局副总工程师兰光剑也未受到应有的追究。省交通厅分管省公路局负责公路修建的某副厅长没有承担任何责任。
    这样的大案得不到处理，即使这里举报箱设得再多也枉然，端正党风何从谈起？
