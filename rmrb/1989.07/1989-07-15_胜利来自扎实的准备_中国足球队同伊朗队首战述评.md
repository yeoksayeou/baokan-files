    Victory Comes from Solid Preparation
    – An Evaluation of China's First Match Against Iran
    By Wang Da Zhao, People's Daily Reporter

    After watching the China-Iran football match, experts and fans will be excited to make many comments and evaluations, because regardless of the gains and losses of both sides, the results are clear.

    The Breathless 30 Minutes

    For this crucial match that determines the group's advancement, one side aims to revive the dream of being the Asian football champion after 10 years, while the other side is making its third attempt in eight years to qualify for the World Cup. However, China's preparation was indeed more meticulous and successful compared to their opponent. It was precisely because of the accumulated strength that they wanted to release all at once, which backfired, and China's performance in the early stages was quite poor.

    Within the first 5 minutes, China had already been penalized by the opponent with two free kicks and one corner kick, and Iran had one shot on goal. Meanwhile, China made several passing errors, and usually reliable Zhang Huikang even struggled with the opening kick. In the first 10 minutes of the first half, Jia Xiuquan made a mistake under pressure and received a yellow card, which was a significant setback. China could not effectively suppress the opponent's quick cuts on the right wing, and even had the ball headed onto the goalpost by Iran's "arrowhead," which was truly heart-wrenching.

    It should be said that the abnormal situation in the first 30 minutes was mainly due to psychological issues, and the problem lay within the team itself. Fortunately, Iran did not capitalize on this period to score, and China's defense line was very decisive in contesting the first header during defensive clearances, barely getting through the difficult phase.

    Breaking the Deadlock and Opening the Path

    China finally had its first shot on goal after 30 minutes, followed by a series of attacks. By the end of the first half, China had 7 shots on goal and 3 corner kicks, while Iran had only one shot on goal. The initiative on the field had clearly shifted to China.

    However, China's midfield coordination was not very smart, and the "cannonballs" were not evenly distributed, causing the already heavily burdened left side to also take on the main attacking duties. It was not until the opponent's defenders focused on blocking one side that China's right side, which had been idle, could finally join the attack. After the teams switched sides, China's Ma Lin and Tang Yao Dong moved to the right wing, not only forcing Iran to defend both sides but also allowing China's left side, Ma Chao and Duan Ju, to advance directly. Without this timely adjustment, the vigorous offensive might have been in vain, and even ultimately unable to break through the door. It should be known that this would make the group's advancement situation very unfavorable.

    The Decisive Headers

    The climax came in the final few minutes. Right back Zhu Bo made two crosses from the wing, and Liu Hai Guang and Zhang Xiaowen headed the ball past the opponent's defense in a timely manner, completing the final attack. These two goals show that while the current Chinese team may not have outstanding scorers, technical advantages, or even a recognized ideal attacking pattern, due to the stable basic lineup and several years of teamwork among the players, they have a good grasp of the established tactics and can firmly carry out tactical intentions in tough confrontations. Even if it's not clever, it's solid and reliable.

    With confidence comes momentum. From this victory over Iran, the Chinese team can summarize many things, making their confidence even firmer.

    胜利来自扎实的准备
    ——中国足球队同伊朗队首战述评
    本报记者  汪大昭
    看过中伊足球赛，行家和球迷都会兴奋地作出许多议论和评价，因为无论双方的得失与成败，都是那样清清楚楚。
    喘不过气来的30分钟
    对这场事关小组出线的重要赛事，一方是时隔10年试图重温亚洲足坛霸主梦，一方是八年来第三次向世界杯决赛圈发起冲击。然而，中国队的备战确实要比对手更为周密和成功。也正是因为积蓄多日的力量恨不得一下子施放出来，适得其反，中国队开场后打得相当糟糕。
    不到5分钟，中国队已被对方罚了两次任意球和一次角球，伊朗队还射门一次。而中国队接连传球失误，一向稳健的张惠康连开球都不利索了。上半时10多分钟，忙中出错的贾秀全吃了黄牌，代价不小。中国队不能有效地遏制对方右翼的快速切入，甚至被伊朗队的“箭头”将球顶到了门柱上，真让人揪心。
    应该说，在前30分钟内的这种反常现象，主要是心理上的问题，毛病出在自己身上。好在伊朗队在这段时间内没有乘势得分，而中国队后卫线防冲吊时第一点争顶又十分坚决，总算度过了难关。
    打破僵局与打开通道
    中国队终于在30分钟后有了第一次射门，继而就是一连串的攻击。上半时结束时，中国队射门已达7次，角球3次，而伊朗队只有一次射门。场上主动权明显转移到中国队手中。
    但是，中国队的中场调度不够聪明，“炮弹”输送不均，使本来防守任务很吃紧的左路还要担负主攻。直到对方守将集中堵塞一侧时，中国队右路仍闲在那里无米下炊。双方易地后，中国队马林和唐尧东转向右翼靠拢，不仅使伊朗队必须兼顾两侧，而且使自己左路麦超和段举得以长驱直入。没有这一及时的调整，旺盛的攻势很可能会徒劳一场，甚至最终敲不开大门。须知，那将使小组出线的形势变得非常恶劣。
    致胜的两记头攻
    高潮出现在最后十几分钟。右后卫朱波两次边路传中，柳海光和张小文在对方防守很严的情况下及时冲顶，完成最后攻击任务。这两个进球表明，目前的中国队虽然没有出色的得分手，没有技术上的优势，甚至没有公认理想的进攻套路。但是，由于基本阵容稳定，队员之间经过几年的配合，对于既定打法掌握得比较熟练，而且能在艰苦的交锋中坚决贯彻战术意图。即使不算巧，确是实实在在的。
    气壮则势猛。中国队从战胜伊朗队这一役中，可以总结出不少东西，使信心更坚定。
