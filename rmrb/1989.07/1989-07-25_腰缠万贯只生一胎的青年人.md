A 28-year-old farmer from Baotun Village, Baotun Township, in our county, named Gao Quntao, and his wife Liu Min, both of whom are junior high school graduates, had a daughter four years ago. In recent years, Gao Quntao not only learned to play the suona, but also started a plastic processing factory, a noodle processing factory, and a general store. His annual income exceeds ten thousand yuan. Now, his daughter is almost five years old. Gao Quntao's parents have been frowning and shaking their heads over the matter of continuing the "family line." Gao Quntao's elder brother died in the line of duty in the army, and the village has repeatedly urged him to have a second child. However, Gao Quntao secretly returned the birth permit without his parents' knowledge. Relatives and neighbors also advised Gao Quntao to have a second child. Gao Quntao thought, "Having an extra child and being fined a few thousand yuan wouldn't be too painful, but family planning is a big deal. Wealthy farmers should set a good example and absolutely should not spend money on exceeding the family planning quota." He also discussed with his wife and promised the village women's federation: "We will only have one child, a girl, and will not have a second child for life."

    腰缠万贯只生一胎的青年人
    我县包屯乡包屯村28岁的农民高群太和妻子刘敏都是初中毕业生，4年前，他们生下一女儿。这几年，高群太不仅学会了吹奏唢呐，又办起了塑料加工厂、面条加工厂和日杂用品门市部，一年收入超万元。眼下，女儿快5岁了，高群太的父母亲一直为续“香火”的事皱眉摇头。高群太的哥哥因公在部队牺牲，村里多次让他生育二胎，高群太却背着父母悄悄地退回了准生证。亲戚邻友也劝高群太生个二胎。高群太想，超生个孩子，罚个几千元伤不了筋骨，但是计划生育是件大事。先富裕起来的农民更应该带好这个头，决不能把钱用在超计划生育上。他还和妻子商量好，向村妇联会保证：只要一个女孩，终生不育二胎。
