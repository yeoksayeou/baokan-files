Japanese Foreign Ministry officials have revealed that the Japanese government has decided to partially lift restrictions on Japanese citizens traveling to China. Starting in August, the situation will be reassessed for a possible complete lifting of restrictions on travel to Beijing. This decision is based on the stabilization of the domestic situation in China following the establishment of a new leadership under Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party.

The decision to advise Japanese citizens not to travel to China was made by the Japanese government in early June.

Additionally, according to the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun*, the Japanese government has decided to resume discussions on Japanese official development assistance to China. It is believed that public order and civilian life in China have largely returned to normal, and the safety of foreigners is no longer a significant concern. Therefore, Japanese technical personnel and experts involved in the research of Japanese official development assistance to China can gradually return to China to resume their work.

    日本外务省人士透露
    日本政府部分解除赴华限制
    本报东京7月29日电　记者于青报道：据日本外务省人士透露，日本政府决定部分解除日本人赴华的限制，8月份以后视情况再研究全部解除日本人赴北京的限制。解除限制的根据是，以江泽民总书记为首的中国共产党新领导体制确立以来，中国国内情势正在恢复平静。
    劝告日本人不要去中国的决定，是日本政府6月初时做出的。
    另据《日本经济新闻》报道，日本政府决定再开日本对华开发援助款项的研讨工作。据认为，中国的治安和市民生活已基本恢复正常，外国人的安全问题已无大危险性，日本从事研究对华开发援助款项的技术人员和专家可以开始陆续赴华恢复工作。
