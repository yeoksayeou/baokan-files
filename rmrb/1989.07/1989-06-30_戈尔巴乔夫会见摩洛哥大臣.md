Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 29th.

Soviet leader Gorbachev today met with the representative of the Arab League's three-party committee on the Lebanese issue and Moroccan Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Filali. Gorbachev said that the Lebanese crisis should be considered in the context of a comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem. Currently, there is a possibility of putting such a solution on a realistic track, and this good opportunity should not be missed.

During the meeting, Filali requested that the Soviet Union, leveraging its close relations with some Arab countries, particularly Syria and Iraq, and its position as a permanent member of the Security Council, contribute to the swift resolution of the Lebanese conflict.

The Moroccan Foreign Minister also conveyed King Hassan II's invitation to Gorbachev to visit Morocco. The Soviet leader expressed his hope that the desire to visit Morocco and the entire Middle East region would be realized.
