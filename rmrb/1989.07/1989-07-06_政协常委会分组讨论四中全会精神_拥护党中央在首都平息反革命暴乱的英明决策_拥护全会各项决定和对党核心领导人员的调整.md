The Standing Committee of the 7th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) held discussions in groups on July 5th and 6th regarding the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). The committee members unanimously supported the CPC Central Committee's decisive action to quell the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, Beijing. They also supported the various decisions made at the Fourth Plenary Session and the adjustments to the core leadership of the Party.

The committee members believed that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee is of great significance in further stabilizing the national situation, consolidating the leadership of the CPC, maintaining the unity of the entire Party and all ethnic groups in the country, and continuing to firmly implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee.

Huang Xiang and Tang Dequan, members of the Standing Committee, stated that the decision to quell the counter-revolutionary riot was wise and decisive. This was primarily due to Comrade Deng Xiaoping, as well as the strong support from the People's Liberation Army and the vast majority of the people. This has brought about a stable and united situation for the Party and the country, contributing to the people. The Fourth Plenary Session also established a new leadership core with Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary, which is a wise strategic decision. Some members of the Standing Committee believed that the significance of the Fourth Plenary Session's communiqué is profound and will have a major impact both domestically and internationally, dealing a significant blow to domestic and foreign reactionary forces. This is inspiring, uplifting, and reassuring.

The committee members believed that the lessons from this turmoil and riot are profound. Over the past ten years, we have not consistently adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, and sometimes there have been only slogans without actions. Tang Ke-sheng and Wu Wenjun, members of the Standing Committee, pointed out that only by adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles can we ensure the correct direction of socialist modernization construction. Only by adhering to reform and opening up can China's construction and development have a future and hope.

Huang Ganying, a member of the Standing Committee, said that the root cause of this turmoil from the student movement to the riot is the inevitable result of the rampant bourgeois liberalization. In recent years, this rampant spread has reached a shocking level. It is reflected in the theoretical, ideological, and literary circles, and its essence is to negate the Four Cardinal Principles. Its goal is to promote political pluralism and a multi-party system. They advocate for wholesale Westernization, calling for the introduction of foreign prime ministers and saying that solving China's economic problems requires the restoration of private ownership.

Kang Keqing, Vice Chairman, and Xu Guangyi, Luo Qun, and other members of the Standing Committee pointed out that over the past few years, ideological and political work has been greatly weakened. Political workers have been downcast, with no status and not being valued. Education on socialism, patriotism, active dedication, and Lei Feng spirit has been lacking. Everything is focused on money, with corruption and bribery spreading, yellow publications flooding the streets, and prostitution becoming increasingly serious. This is the result of the serious spread of bourgeois liberalization.

Many members of the Standing Committee proposed during the discussion that the corruption within the Party and the issue of official profiteering cannot be avoided. The occurrence of this turmoil and riot is due to a small number of people with ulterior motives who have exploited people's lack of understanding and dissatisfaction, causing the situation to escalate. They hope that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council will seriously implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session's communiqué, focus on four major tasks, resolutely combat corruption, and effectively address several issues of concern to the people. To govern cleanly and gain the trust of the people. Xu Zhaolong, a member of the Standing Committee, said that after the turmoil, the main concern is how to handle reform and opening up. The relationship between the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, the Central Committee and the State Council need to have clear policies, strengthen leadership and guidance, and take more effective measures. Xu Zhaolong, a member of the Standing Committee, proposed two hopes: economic management should be considered comprehensively, not just treating the symptoms, and some measures should be more complete; strengthening macro-control is important, but the initiative of the grassroots should be encouraged, and it should not be too rigid. Jing Shuping, a member of the Standing Committee, said that now the main thing is to see action and do a few practical things, so as to win the hearts of the people. Doing practical things, first of all, is to combat corruption. In addition, industrial policy and regional development policy should be combined as soon as possible, otherwise limited financial resources will be wasted. It is hoped that the Central Committee will take practical actions as soon as possible.

    政协常委会分组讨论四中全会精神
    拥护党中央在首都平息反革命暴乱的英明决策
    拥护全会各项决定和对党核心领导人员的调整
    新华社北京7月6日电　全国政协七届常委会第七次会议7月5日、6日分组讨论中共十三届四中全会精神。常委们在讨论中一致拥护党中央在首都北京平息反革命暴乱的英明决策，拥护中共十三届四中全会各项决定，拥护对党的核心领导机构组成人员的调整。
    常委们认为，中共十三届四中全会对于进一步稳定全国局势、巩固中国共产党的领导，维护全党与全国各族人民的团结，继续坚定不移地贯彻执行中共十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，具有极其重大意义。
    黄翔和汤德全常委表示，这次平息反革命暴乱的决策是英明果断的。这首先应归功于邓小平同志，其次是强大的人民解放军和绝大多数人民群众的支持。从而给党和国家带来安定团结的局面，为人民做出了贡献。四中全会还建立了以江泽民为总书记的党的第三代领导核心，这是一个英明的战略决策。一些常委认为，四中全会公报意义深远，在国内外都将产生重大影响，对国内外反动势力是很大打击。令人感到鼓舞、振奋、放心。
    常委们在讨论中认为，这场动乱和暴乱的教训是十分深刻的。十年来，我们抓四个坚持不够一贯，甚至只有口号，没有行动。谈镐生、吴文俊常委指出，只有坚持四项基本原则，才能保证社会主义现代化建设的正确前进方向，只有坚持改革开放，中国的建设和发展才有前途和希望。
    黄甘英常委说，这次从学潮到动乱，再到暴乱，其根源就是资产阶级自由化泛滥的必然结果。这几年，这种泛滥达到令人吃惊的地步。理论、思想、文艺界都反映出来，它的实质就是否定四项基本原则，其目的是要搞政治的多元化，多党制。他们鼓吹全盘西化，叫嚷要引进外国总理，并说解决中国的经济问题就得恢复私有制。
    康克清副主席和胥光义、罗琼等常委指出，几年来，思想政治工作受到很大削弱，政工干部灰溜溜的，没有地位，不受重视。社会主义、爱国主义、积极奉献、雷锋精神的教育没有了。一切向钱看，贪污腐化现象蔓延，黄色书刊充斥街头，暗娼卖淫问题日益严重，这是资产阶级自由化严重泛滥的结果。
    许多常委在讨论中提出，党内存在的腐败现象和官倒问题。造成人民群众的不满情绪这一点不能回避。这次动乱和暴乱的发生就是一小撮别有用心的人利用人们不明真相和不满情绪，使事态不断扩大。他们希望党中央和国务院能认真贯彻四中全会公报精神，抓好四件大事，坚决惩治腐败，切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情。为政清廉，取信于民。徐昭隆常委说，动乱后，最关心的是改革、开放怎么办？四个坚持与改革、开放如何结合，中央和国务院要有明确方针，切实加强领导和指导，采取更有力的措施。徐昭隆常委提出两点希望：治理经济要统筹考虑，不能头痛医头，脚痛医脚，有些措施要定得完备些；加强宏观控制很重要，但要发挥基层的积极性，不要管得太死。经叔平常委说，现在主要看行动，干几件实事，这样才能得民心。干实事，首先是惩治贪污。另外，产业政策与地区发展政策应赶快结合，否则浪费了有限的财力。希望中央尽快拿出实际行动。
