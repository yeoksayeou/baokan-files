People's Daily, Guiyang, July 10th. Reporter Hu Yueping reports: The Guiyang Municipal Party Committee and Government have recently taken measures to strengthen moral education in primary and secondary schools.

Guiyang currently has 250,000 primary and secondary school students. In recent years, due to the neglect of moral education, the ideological and moral quality of some students has declined, their sense of law and order has weakened, and the school culture in some schools is poor, causing widespread concern. To address this, the Municipal Party Committee and Government have decided to take the following measures to promptly and effectively enhance moral education in primary and secondary schools.

— The Municipal Party Committee and Government will establish a joint conference system starting now, inviting relevant department heads to participate, and will hold regular joint conferences in the future to ensure that moral education in primary and secondary schools is coordinated and effectively carried out under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and Government.

— Party and government leaders at all levels in the city will each take responsibility for one primary or secondary school, leading by example in participating in the school's moral education work. Various levels of propaganda, cultural departments, labor, youth, women's, street, and parent organizations will closely cooperate with the schools to promote moral education, gradually forming a city-wide social network.

— Strengthen the construction of the moral education team in primary and secondary schools, and assign full-time moral education instructors. Middle schools with 24 or more classes will establish a moral education office, while those with fewer than 24 classes will have the vice-principal or deputy principal oversee moral education work. Educational administrative departments at all levels and over 600 primary and secondary schools will establish a moral education organizational leadership and supervision system from top to bottom, forming a management system with clear goals, plans, summaries, inspections, and evaluations.

In addition, the Municipal Party Committee and Government have formulated ten key points for moral education work in all primary and secondary schools in the city for the second half of this year. Currently, these ten items are being actively implemented with the cooperation of various departments in society, and some have already shown results. For example, activities centered on patriotic education and revolutionary tradition education, as well as daily behavior training for primary and secondary school students, have all achieved good results.

    提高思想素质　重视校风建设
    贵阳加强中小学生德育教育
    本报贵阳7月10日电　记者胡跃平报道：贵州省贵阳市委、市政府最近采取措施，加强中小学的德育工作。
    贵阳现有25万在校中小学生。近年来，由于德育遭到冷落，一些学生的思想道德素质下降，法纪观念淡薄，部分学校校风较差，引起人们的普遍忧虑。为此，市委、市政府决定采取以下措施，抓紧抓好中小学德育工作。
    ——市委、市政府从现在起建立联席会议制度，吸收有关方面负责人参加，并在今后定期召开联席会，使中小学德育工作在市委、市政府统一领导下协调地、有效地进行。
    ——全市各级党政领导干部分别联系一所中小学校，带头参加学校德育工作。各级宣传、文化部门、工、青、妇、街道和家长，都要密切联系学校，抓好德育工作，逐渐形成全市性的社会网络。
    ——加强中小学德育工作队伍建设，配备专职的德育教导人员。24个班以上的中学成立德育处，24个班以下的中学由教导主任或副主任兼管德育工作。各级教育行政部门和600多所中小学校，由上而下建立起德育工作组织领导和监督保证系统，形成有目标、有计划、有总结、有检查和评估的管理体系。
    此外，市委、市政府还制定了今年下半年全市中小学德育工作的十大要点。目前，这十项工作在社会各部门配合下，正在积极着手开展，有的已见成效。如开展以爱国主义教育和革命传统教育为主题的各项活动、对中小学生日常行为规范训练等，都收到了较好的效果。
