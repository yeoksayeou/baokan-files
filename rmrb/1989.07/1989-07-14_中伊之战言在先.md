It is unclear from when exactly, but a sense of complacency has emerged in Chinese football circles, where the Iranian team is considered no threat. In 1983, Iran sent their top-tier team, the Omid Club, to participate in the Chinese Long City Cup, and the Chinese team won 2:1. The following year, the Iranian national team was defeated 0:1 by the Chinese team during a stopover in Beijing. This is probably the basis for the belief that the Iranian team poses no threat. In reality, the Chinese team has yet to defeat the Iranian team in any significant official match. Last year, during the Asian Cup final, the two teams played to a 0:0 draw in 90 minutes, which is considered the best result for the Chinese team. However, in the penalty shootout, it was the Iranians who emerged victorious.

As the date for the upcoming match between China and Iran approaches, the view that the Iranian team has a slight edge in strength has become more prevalent. Even the assessment that both teams have a 50% chance of winning is quite bold.

Iran is a country with a rich football tradition. In the face of progress by a group of strong teams in East and West Asia, the Iranian team has not stood still. They not only utilize their physical advantages to play tough matches but have also begun to incorporate modern playing styles.

Due to the convenience of the match schedule, the Chinese team has a good chance of advancing if they win at home. A draw would be risky, and a loss would make the prospects bleak. The most important factor here is confidence.

Compared to last year's Asian Cup final, the Chinese team has made fewer adjustments to its lineup than the Iranian team. The team is relatively stable. The players have a better understanding and coordination with each other. Moreover, the new additions to the team are to make up for those who were unable to participate in the competition due to objective reasons. From the training and preparation, it is also more thorough and meticulous this time. The friendly match in the Soviet Union has China performing normally, which has a certain role in boosting confidence.

The Iranian team's coach has boasted that they will win by a margin of three goals, a very confident statement. The Chinese team has had some experience with tall and strong opponents. At this point, the Chinese team must strive to win at home and shout louder.

    中伊之战言在先
    本报记者　汪大昭
    说不准从什么时候起，中国足坛出现了一种伊朗队不足为虑的自我感觉。1983年，伊朗派出甲级劲旅奥米德俱乐部队参加中国长城杯赛，中国队以2∶1得胜。第二年，伊朗国家队出访途中，在北京以0∶1败给中国队。这大概就是伊朗队不足惧的依据。其实，中国队至今尚无在重要的正式赛事中击败伊朗队的战绩，去年在亚洲杯决赛时双方90分钟踢成0∶0，这要算是中国队的最佳成绩了。互射点球时还是伊朗人赢了。
    随着这次中伊之战赛期临近，伊朗队实力略占上风的说法又多了起来，甚至双方各有五成胜券的判断也够大胆的了。
    伊朗是个有足球传统的国家，在东、西亚一批劲旅的进步面前，伊朗队并未原地踏步，不仅能利用身体优势打硬仗，也开始注意吸收当今潮流打法。
    中国队由于赛程安排上的便宜，主场能胜便有把握出线，打平则凶多吉少，输了就前景渺茫。这里最重要的是信心。
    与去年亚洲杯决赛时相比，中国队阵容的调整幅度没有伊朗队大，队伍比较稳定。队员之间的相互了解和配合也比较熟，而且新增的队员都是补足当时由于客观原因没能参加比赛的。从训练和准备情况看，也比上次更为充分和周密。访苏热身赛中国队发挥正常，对进一步增强信心也有一定作用。
    伊朗队教练放出风来，扬言将净胜中国队三个球，口气挺大。对身高体壮的对手中国队曾有所领教。到了这个时候，中国队只有把主场力争拚胜，喊得更响才是。
