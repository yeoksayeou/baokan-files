At the invitation of Polish Council of State Chairman Jaruzelski, U.S. President Bush and his wife arrived in Warsaw by special plane on July 9, beginning a three-day official visit to Poland.

Polish party and government leaders, including Jaruzelski, were at the airport to welcome them.

Bush is the fourth U.S. president to visit Poland, following Nixon, Ford, and Carter. This is also his second visit to Poland, the first being in September 1987.

Bush's visit comes at a time when Poland's economic crisis remains severe, and the authorities are exploring various ways to overcome it. The Polish authorities hope that through Bush's visit, they can fully restore the normal state-to-state relations between Poland and the United States, especially economic relations, which had deteriorated a few years ago.

The New China News Agency reported from Washington on July 9 that Polish leader Jaruzelski said today that Poland welcomes U.S. economic aid but does not want it to interfere in Poland's domestic affairs.

Jaruzelski said on the CNN program "Sunday Morning" that the United States can participate in actions beneficial to Poland in two ways: first, by promoting the development of joint ventures and paving the way for Poland to export to the United States; second, by using its position in the Western world to help pass resolutions favorable to Poland.

When asked how Poland would carry out deep reforms in return for U.S. aid, Jaruzelski said, "I believe that President Bush does not intend to interfere in our domestic affairs."

Jaruzelski expressed these views on the eve of Bush's visit to Poland.

    布什抵达华沙
    波兰欢迎美援但不希望它干涉内政
    新华社华沙7月9日电  应波兰国务委员会主席雅鲁泽尔斯基的邀请，美国总统布什偕夫人一行于9日乘专机抵达华沙，开始对波兰进行为期3天的正式访问。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基等波兰党政领导人到机场迎接。
    布什是继尼克松、福特和卡特之后访问波兰的第4位美国总统。这也是他本人第2次访问波兰，上次访问是在1987年9月进行的。
    布什是在波兰经济危机依然很严重，当局正在千方百计地探索摆脱危机办法的情况下来波兰访问的。波兰当局希望通过布什这次的访问，完全恢复几年前一度恶化了的波兰同美国之间的正常国家关系，特别是经济关系。
    新华社华盛顿7月9日电波兰领导人雅鲁泽尔斯基今天说，波兰欢迎美国提供经济援助，但不希望它干涉波兰内政。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基在美国有线新闻电视台的《星期日新闻人物》节目中说，美国可以从两个方面参与对波兰有益的行动：一是促进发展合资经营一类的公司，并为波兰向美国出口铺平道路；二是美国利用其在西方世界的地位帮助通过有利于波兰的决议。
    在被问到波兰将如何进行深入改革以回报美国的援助时，雅鲁泽尔斯基说：“我相信（布什）总统是不打算干涉我们的内政。”
    雅鲁泽尔斯基是在布什访波前夕表明这些看法的。
