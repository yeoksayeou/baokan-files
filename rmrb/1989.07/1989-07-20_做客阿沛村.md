In late April, when spring was in full bloom, I visited Apé Village in Gongbujiangda County. The area is surrounded by towering mountains and crisscrossed by deep valleys. The county seat and the adjacent Apé Village are nestled in a valley that resembles a well. Looking out, the peaks of Apé Mountain, standing at over 4,700 meters, are covered with pristine white snow. Beneath the snow-capped mountains, on the northern wall of the valley, lies Apé Village, adorned with blooming peach, apricot, and bougainvillea flowers. Behind the village, six massive walnut trees stand like six giant green umbrellas, shielding the village. At the foot of the village, the Niangqu River flows gently, winding along the mountains and cliffs, paralleling the Sichuan-Tibet Highway.

As soon as our car stopped at the village entrance, a group of children gathered around to watch. I asked a girl who appeared to be about nine years old, "Do you know Apé Awang Jinmei?"

"Yes," she replied in Tibetan, her voice soft and sweet. "He is the Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee. Apé Grandpa is good!"

"How is he good?"

"He loves our country!"

Upon entering the village and conversing with the locals, the villagers all praised Apé Awang Jinmei's character.

A middle-aged man handed me a document containing a reminiscence written by the former Secretary of the Tibet Autonomous Region Party Committee, Yin Fatang. One passage mentioned that in the autumn of 1951, when the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, they faced difficulties in transporting supplies to Gongbujiangda. Apé Awang Jinmei ordered his steward to open the granaries and provide grain, helping the troops overcome the crisis.

The conversation naturally turned to the history of the area: The Apé Manor was established in 100 BC. At that time, the eighth king of Tibet, Chigongzanbu, was assassinated by his subordinates. His three sons, Xiachi, Jiachi, and Niechi, fled to the Gongbu region. The youngest son, Niechi, prayed to the heavens for a place to settle. He shot an arrow, and it landed in the Xionglong area, now known as Apé Village. Niechi joyfully exclaimed "Apé," meaning "destiny has brought me here." He then established the Apé Manor. Before Tibet's liberation, Niechi's descendant, Cairen Qigia, married Apé Awang Jinmei. The couple were deeply in love. Today, in the Apé Garden, there stands a pair of intertwined ancient pines, over 30 meters tall, known as the Apé Couple Trees.

I asked the villagers to share the current situation in the village. Apé Village's Party Secretary, Aniu, said, "If we were to describe the characteristics of Apé Village in two words, it would be 'patriotic.' In 1959, when the upper echelons of Tibet launched an armed rebellion, not a single person from Apé Village participated. The village's Communist Youth League branch conducted various activities based on their love for the country. The Tibet Daily published a lengthy article about it." Deputy Party Secretary Cida Duoji introduced that Apé Village has 140 residents, all of whom are Tibetan. In 1988, the harvest was bountiful, and after paying taxes and setting aside seeds, each person had 406 kilograms of grain. When it came time to sell the patriotic grain, no one lagged behind. As a result, each person sold 250 kilograms of grain to the state, leaving only 13 kilograms per person per month for personal consumption. I asked if 13 kilograms of grain per month was enough to eat. An elderly man at the door eagerly replied, "It's more than enough. We Tibetans eat a lot of beef and mutton." This was true. I saw many Tibetans resting, holding large pieces of dried mutton, cutting off small pieces, and eating them like dried radishes. I also tried a small piece, and it indeed had a unique flavor.

As we spoke, we arrived at the home of Duoji Zhangdu, by the banks of the Niangqu River. It was a single-family residence with a roof adorned with colorful prayer flags, following Tibetan customs. Inside the house, portraits of party and state leaders hung on the wall, and beneath them, a bright red scarf was respectfully hung, belonging to Duoji Zhangdu's 9-year-old grandson. I asked, "Do all the children in the village go to school?" Secretary Aniu replied, "In our township, the enrollment rate for children is 100%. Initially, there were one or two families who did not send their children to school. We fined them 15 yuan per month, but it didn't work. So, we changed our approach and said, 'If you don't send your children to school, it means you lack patriotic ideals.' This approach worked."

After sitting down, I glanced around the room and saw that in one corner of the main room, there was a curved bench covered with a woven tapestry. Between the benches stood a gleaming red lacquered square table, with two dancing golden dragons painted on its surface.

Duoji Zhangdu's second son, Caiwang Dingqing, had already moved out and currently has a family of five. Duoji Zhangdu is a skilled weaver of Tibetan felt, producing 500 meters per year. His 38-year-old eldest son, Suolang Wangju, bought a Liberation-brand truck for transportation, while his wife and daughter-in-law, Lajiaoma, stay home to farm and raise livestock. They currently own 9 yellow cattle, 1 yak, 3 draft cattle, 4 yaks, and 22 sheep. When asked about his annual income, he said, "It's about ten thousand yuan." Secretary Aniu told me, "In Xionglong Township, half of the 296 households have an annual income of over ten thousand yuan."

As we talked, Lajiaoma smiled and offered us barley wine. Following local customs, I dipped my ring finger in the wine and flicked it three times into the air. I took a small sip the first time, and Lajiaoma refilled the cup. The second time, I took another small sip, and she refilled it again. On the third sip, I drank the full cup. Only after completing this customary ritual could the guest choose to drink more or not.

After finishing the barley wine, we toured their bedrooms and storage rooms, and discussed various topics such as local specialties, customs, moral values, and soil quality. I then bid my farewell and drove to the Apé Bridge for a visit. It was an iron suspension bridge, with the bridge gate adorned with the words "Apé Bridge" in both Tibetan and Chinese. As I admired the bridge, a Liberation-brand truck laden with timber rumbled across it. The driver, knowing I had come specifically to see the bridge, jumped out of the driver's seat and enthusiastically introduced, "In the past, there was no bridge over the Niangqu River. The people of the Zangsa Village across from Apé Village had to use sheep-skin rafts to cross. It is said that once, four people drowned. Apé Awang Jinmei was very sad and expressed, 'In the future, I will build a bridge.' In 1985, he donated 540,000 yuan from his personal funds to build this bridge and a small hydroelectric power station."

As we parted ways, the driver stuck his head out of the driver's seat and, with a round and resonant voice, said to me, "Beijing guest, please tell Vice Chairman Apé Awang Jinmei that the people of Apé's hometown will definitely love our country just as he does!" The heartfelt words echoed for a long time in the valley.

    做客阿沛村
    本报记者　罗同松
    春光融融的4月下旬，我来到工布江达县阿沛村访问。这里群山重重，沟谷纵横，县城以及与县城毗邻的阿沛村座落在有如井底的峡谷之中。放眼望去，海拔4700多米高的阿沛山顶覆盖着皑皑白雪；雪山底下，峡谷北壁，便是桃花、杏花、紫荆等各种鲜花簇拥的阿沛村。村后6棵粗大核桃树，有如6把绿色大伞，罩在村子的上面，村庄脚下，畅流着春水漫漫的尼羊河，逶迤着缠山绕崖的川藏公路。
    我们的车在村口刚停下，便有一群孩子上来围观。我问一个大约9岁的女孩：“你知道阿沛·阿旺晋美吗？”
    “知道。”她用藏语回答，声音稚嫩而甜蜜。“他是全国人大常委会副委员长，阿沛老爷爷好！”
    “怎么好？”
      “他爱祖国！”
    进了村和人们交谈，村民们都赞美阿沛·阿旺晋美的为人。
    有位中年男子递给我一份材料，上面有原西藏自治区党委书记阴法唐写的回忆，其中一段说，1951年秋天，人民解放军进藏部队到达工布江达时，粮食运不上来，阿沛·阿旺晋美吩咐管家开仓取粮，帮助进藏部队度过了当时的难关。
    沉浸在回忆中的谈话，自然也涉及到了这里的历史：阿沛庄园创建于公元前100年。当时，西藏第八王朝当政的赤工赞布被手下的大臣暗害了，3个儿子暇赤、贾赤、聂赤被迫逃到工布地区。三儿子聂赤向天祈祷，寻找安身之处。他发射一箭，箭落在峡龙地区，即现在的阿沛村。于是聂赤喜悦地说了“阿沛”二字，意即“命运把我安排在这里”。此后，他创建了阿沛庄园。西藏解放前，聂赤后裔才旦卓嘎招赘阿沛·阿旺晋美为夫，夫妻恩爱。如今，阿沛花园中有一对高达30余米的连理青松，苍劲挺拔，村民们称其为阿沛夫妻树。
    我请大家谈谈村里的现实情况。阿沛村所在的峡龙乡党委书记阿牛说：“要说阿沛村的特点，恐怕就只两个字——爱国。1959年，西藏上层分子发动武装叛乱，阿沛村没有一个人参加；阿沛村的共青团小组，以热爱祖国为出发点进行各种活动，《西藏日报》曾以大篇幅进行过宣扬。”乡党委副书记次达多吉介绍，阿沛村现有老少人丁140口，全是藏族。1988年粮食丰收，大家交过公粮，留足种籽，人均所得406公斤。到交售爱国粮时，谁也不甘落后。结果人均售给国家粮食250公斤，每人每月只留13公斤口粮。我问每月13公斤粮食够不够吃？门口一位阿爹抢着说：“满够了。我们藏族人吃牛羊肉多。”这话不假。我看到许多藏民休息时，手拿一大块风干生羊肉，用刀子割成小块，就像嚼萝卜干那样吃着玩儿。我也曾要过一小块放进嘴里，的确别有风味。
    说着话，我们来到尼羊河岸边多吉占堆阿爹家里。这是一座独院，房顶按藏家习俗插着五颜六色的经幡，屋内正中贴着党和国家领导人画像，画像下边，恭敬地挂着一条鲜艳的红领巾，这是多吉占堆那9岁孙子的。于是我问：“村里的孩子都上学吗？”阿牛书记说：在我们乡，儿童入学率为百分之百。起先，有一两户人家不让孩子上学，每月罚他15元钱，不管用，我们就改变办法，对他说，“你不让孩子上学，就是没有爱国思想”，这一说便灵了。
    坐定后我扫了一眼屋内，只见正房的一角，呈曲尺形摆着铺有织锦毡垫的长凳，长凳之间摆着光可鉴人的红漆方桌，桌面画着两条舞动的金龙。
    多吉占堆的二儿子才旺丁青已分居，时下家有5口人。多吉占堆是织氆氇的能手，每年可织500米。38岁的大儿子索朗旺久买了一台解放牌大卡车跑运输，老伴和儿媳拉卓玛在家种地、养牲畜。他们家现有黄牛9头，犏牛1头，耕牛3头，牦牛4头，绵羊22只。问他年收入，他说：“也就是万把块的样子。”阿牛书记对我说：峡龙乡296户，年收入超万元的有一半。
    说着，拉卓玛笑眯眯地献上了青稞酒。我入乡随俗，先用无名指蘸酒朝空弹3下，第一口稍许喝一点，拉卓玛给满上；第二口仍稍许喝一点，拉卓玛再给满上，第三口将满杯酒喝光。只有当这套约定俗成的礼节过后，客人再喝或者是不喝，便可听其自由了。
    喝完青稞酒，参观过他们的卧室和杂屋，又谈了些有关特产、习惯、道德观念以至土壤性质之类的琐事，我便告辞，驱车前往阿沛大桥参观。这是一座铁索吊桥，高大的桥门上，用藏、汉两种文字写着“阿沛大桥”4字。我正在欣赏满载木材的解放牌大卡车重重地从桥上过来，司机了解我是专门来看桥的，便从驾驶室跳下来，滔滔不绝地介绍：过去，尼羊河上没有桥，阿沛村对面的仲萨村群众要过河，全用羊皮筏子。据说，有次淹死了4个人，阿沛·阿旺晋美很难过，表示“将来要修座桥”。1985年，他拿出私人财产54万元人民币，修了这座大桥和一座小水电站。
    我们分别时，那位司机从驾驶室探出头来，用圆润哄亮的嗓音对我说：“北京客人，请你告诉阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长，阿沛故乡人一定像他那样热爱祖国！”饱藏情意的话音，久久地在峡谷间回响。
