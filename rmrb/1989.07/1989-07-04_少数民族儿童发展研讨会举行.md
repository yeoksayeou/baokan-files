The conference on the development of minority children, organized by the China Center for Children's Development, began on July 2 in Hohhot. Leaders from the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the State Family Planning Commission, the Ministry of Health, and senior officials from the United Nations Children's Fund, including Parker and Dale, attended the meeting.

This conference is a follow-up to the "National Expert Symposium on Children's Development in Minority Areas" held in July 1985. After that meeting, experts and child workers from 19 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions conducted in-depth research under difficult conditions, gathering a wealth of firsthand data. This data is highly valuable for studying the laws governing the physical and mental health development of minority children. This conference will delve deeper into these studies.

    这次研讨会是1985年7月“全国少数民族地区儿童发展专家座谈会”的继续。那次会议后，19个省、市、区研究儿童身心的专家和儿童工作者在艰苦条件下，深入实际，获得了大量一手资料，对研究少数民族儿童身心健康发展的规律很有价值。本次会议将在这方面进行更深入的切磋。
