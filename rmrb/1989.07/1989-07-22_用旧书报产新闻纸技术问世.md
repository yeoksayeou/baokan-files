A technology for producing newspaper from old books and newspapers has recently been developed and passed inspection. This type of newspaper is now in mass production.

It is understood that in recent years, the raw materials for producing newspaper in our country have been severely insufficient. However, due to technical reasons, a large amount of waste paper from old books and newspapers has not been able to be reused. After more than two years of scientific and technological research, the Meihekou City Xinxing Paper Mill in Jilin Province has finally mastered the technology for producing recycled newspaper from old books and newspapers.

Experts have determined that the main technical indicators of the recycled newspaper have reached or exceeded the national standard for No. 2 newspaper.

    用旧书报产新闻纸技术问世
    新华社长春7月22日电  （通讯员谢晓林）一种利用旧书报生产新闻纸的技术日前通过鉴定，这种新闻纸现已投入批量生产。
    据了解，近年来我国生产新闻纸的原材料严重不足，可是由于技术等原因，大量的废旧书报又得不到再生利用。吉林省梅河口市新星造纸厂经过两年多科技攻关，终于掌握了将旧书报脱墨再生新闻纸的生产技术。
    专家鉴定表明，再生新闻纸的主要技术指标已达到或超过国家2号新闻纸标准。
