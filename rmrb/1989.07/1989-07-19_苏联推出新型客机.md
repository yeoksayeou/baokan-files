The Soviet Union introduced a new type of medium-range passenger aircraft, the "Tu-334," to the international aviation community on July 18. The aircraft is expected to be delivered for official use next year.

The "Tu-334" passenger aircraft has 102 seats, a maximum range of 2000 kilometers, and a speed of 800 kilometers per hour.

The aircraft is equipped with two "D-436T" turbofan engines at the tail, reducing fuel consumption by half compared to its predecessor, the "Tu-134" passenger aircraft.

The "Tu-334" passenger aircraft will be fitted with more fuel-efficient, low-noise propeller fan engines.

At that time, with the same 10 tons of fuel, it can fly at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour, but the passenger capacity can be increased by 24 people, and the range can be increased by half.

    苏联推出新型客机
    新华社莫斯科7月18日电　7月18日苏联向外国民航界介绍了新型中程客机“图—334”式飞机。该机可望于明年正式交付使用。
    “图—334”式客机有102个座位，最大航程2000公里，时速800公里。
    该机机尾装有两台“D—436T”涡轮风扇发动机，燃料耗损比其前身“图—134”式客机减少一半。
    “图—334”式客机将换上更省燃料的低噪音螺旋桨风扇发动机。
    届时，同样装10吨油，飞800公里的时速，但载客量可增加24名，航程可增加一半。
