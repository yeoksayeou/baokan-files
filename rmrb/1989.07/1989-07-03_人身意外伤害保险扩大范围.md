    **People's Daily** reports that in response to requests from foreign trading companies and corporations, the People's Insurance Company of China has recently included war, strikes, civil unrest, riots, and rebellions within the scope of personal accident insurance liability. In addition to the aforementioned compensation responsibilities, the existing clauses regarding compensation for personal injury or death resulting from various natural disasters and accidents remain effective.

    人身意外伤害保险扩大范围
    本报讯　应外国商社、公司的要求，近日，中国人民保险公司将战争、罢工、民众骚动、暴乱、叛乱列入人身意外伤害保险的责任范围。这项保险的范围除增加了上述赔偿责任外，对原有条款中规定的因各种自然灾害、意外事故导致人身伤亡给予赔偿的内容继续有效。
    由于该项保险扩展了保险范围，保险费率要增加0.3％，即从原费率的0.9％增至1.2％。
    保险公司强调指出，参加本保险的人员不得是上述事件或行动的参与者，否则不予赔偿。对条款中列明的其它除外责任不承担赔偿责任。
    据悉，到6月22日止，已经有34名外籍和香港企业界人士前往投保。另有200多名外商投资企业中的中国雇员也由其公司投保。
