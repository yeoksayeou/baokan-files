The kangaroo is considered a symbol of Australia. On Australia's coat of arms, in animated films, on tourist souvenirs, and on various trademarks, one can often see the image of a kangaroo.

However, in Australia, some people have proposed making kangaroo meat into a unique dish similar to China's roast duck or France's escargot to attract tourists. Yet, as soon as this idea was put forward, it sparked a continuous debate in Australia.

The incident occurred last year when the Australian Meat Producers Association hosted a banquet for 40 political figures, serving dishes such as roasted kangaroo meat, stewed kangaroo meat, kangaroo meatballs, and grilled kangaroo skewers—essentially a full kangaroo feast. Once the news was revealed, animal protection groups and people from various sectors in Australia were outraged.

Regarding the consumption of kangaroo meat, a spokesperson for the "Liberate Animals" organization deemed it a disaster. Hugh Arnold, the director of the "Australians for Animals" organization, which has 35,000 members nationwide, expressed his concerns: "Now that they are proposing to eat kangaroo meat, who knows which animal will be next? Perhaps soon someone will propose eating koalas!"

In contrast, another viewpoint argues that, given the excessive number of kangaroos that have become a disaster in Australia, and the government's allowance for a certain number to be hunted, kangaroo meat should not be discarded. It is an underutilized resource that should be developed into food or cuisine. It is reported that Australia currently has between 18 million and 28 million kangaroos. They often gather in groups, destroying crops and harming pastures, causing farmers an annual loss of $89 million.

Therefore, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has approved the annual "humane" hunting of 2.8 million kangaroos. High-quality leather made from kangaroo skins can be exported to earn foreign exchange. In reality, in South Australia and the northern regions, kangaroo meat has already become a staple. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Australia also supports this proposal, with a spokesperson stating: "There is nothing wrong with hunting kangaroos for food, as long as it does not affect the kangaroo population and the hunting methods are 'humane.'"

It is truly a case of "beauty is in the eye of the beholder." As for whether the kangaroos, which Australians usually view as pets, will become part of their daily diet, we will have to wait and see.

    袋鼠风波
    张旭平
    袋鼠，被认为是澳大利亚的象征。
    在澳大利亚的国徽上，动画片上，旅游纪念品上，以及多种多样的商标上，常常可以看到袋鼠的图案。
    但是，在澳大利亚，也有人提出将袋鼠肉做成一种类似中国的烤鸭、法国的蜗牛那样的独特菜式及旅游食品来吸引游客。可是此议一推出，在澳大利亚就惹起一场连绵不断的争论。
    事情发生在去年，澳大利亚肉类生产者联盟设宴款待40位政界人士，菜式有烧袋鼠肉、炖袋鼠肉、袋鼠肉丸、烧袋鼠肉串等等，堪称袋鼠全宴。消息一经披露，澳大利亚保护动物的团体和各界人士顿时哗然，群起而攻之。
    对吃袋鼠肉，“解放动物”组织的一位发言人认为这无异是一场灾难。在全国拥有3.5万会员的“澳洲人爱动物”组织总监休·阿诺德忧心忡忡地说：现在提出吃袋鼠肉，谁知下次会轮到哪种动物呢！也许不久后又会有人提出吃袋熊哩！
    与此针锋相对的一种观点认为，鉴于为数过多的袋鼠已成为澳大利亚的一种灾难，国家又允许一定数量的捕杀，因此袋鼠肉不应废弃，它是一种未被充分利用的资源，理应开发成为食品或菜肴。据悉，澳大利亚现有袋鼠1800万——2800万只。它们常常成群结队，毁坏庄稼，为害牧场，每年给农民造成的损失达8900万美元。
    因此，澳大利亚国家公园及野生动物管理局批准人们每年可用“仁慈的方式”捕杀280万只袋鼠。用袋鼠皮制成的优质皮革可供出口以赚取外汇。而实际上，在南澳大利亚州及北部地区，袋鼠肉早已登堂入室了。澳大利亚皇家防止虐畜会对此议也表示支持，该会发言人宣称：捕杀袋鼠供人吃没什么不对，只要不影响袋鼠的数量，捕杀方式“合乎人道”即可。
    真是“仁者见仁，智者见智”。至于澳洲人一向视为宠物的袋鼠是否会成为他们的日常食品呢，还得走着瞧。
