The Chinese youth delegation participating in the 13th World Youth Festival in Pyongyang held a friendly gathering with Korean youth and youth representatives from approximately 30 other countries at the Chinese Club tonight.

Around 8 PM, youth and student representatives from various countries, dressed in their traditional attire, began arriving at the Chinese Club. The various activity areas within the club were filled with people.

The souvenir shop set up in the main hall of the club was particularly busy today. Items like a clay figurine or a beaded handbag could evoke memories of this friendly gathering. Many people crowded around the counter, selecting items they liked.

In front of the club, which is adorned with a traditional Chinese red gate, is a plaza. Youth from various countries and Chinese youth representatives enjoyed the cool night breeze, some chatting at small tables, others dancing together, exchanging feelings, and deepening understanding and friendship. The gathering continued late into the night. Approximately seven or eight hundred representatives from various countries participated in this friendly activity.

Pyongyang's tens of thousands of youth and students held a torch relay titled "Youth and Students for Peace and a World Without Nuclear Weapons" at Kim Il-sung Square in the city center tonight. This is one of the major celebratory events prepared by North Korea to welcome the 13th World Youth Festival held in Pyongyang.

North Korean party and state leaders, including Ri Chong-yu, and some state leaders who were invited as honorary guests to visit Pyongyang for this festival observed today's torch relay. Representatives from South Korean student organizations, including Lim Su-gyeong, who came to Pyongyang to observe the festival, also participated in today's torch relay.

    据新华社平壤7月4日电　（记者朱克川）在平壤参加第13届世界青年联欢节的中国青年代表团，今晚邀请朝鲜青年和前来参加联欢节的约30个国家的青年代表在中国俱乐部举行友好联欢。
    8时许，肤色不同的各国青年和学生代表穿着自己的民族服装陆续来到中国俱乐部。在俱乐部的各个活动场所都挤满了人。
    设在俱乐部场内大厅的纪念品小卖部今天生意格外兴隆，一个泥人，一个珠饰手袋，都可以唤起对这次友好聚会的回忆，许多人都挤在柜台前挑选自己喜欢的东西。
    架起中国传统式红色宫门的俱乐部前面，是一个广场。各国的青年朋友和中国的青年代表在清爽的夜风中，有的在茶几前谈话，有的跳集体舞，互相交流感情，增进了解与友谊。联欢一直持续到深夜。参加这次联欢活动的各国代表约有七八百人。
    据新华社平壤7月4日电　（记者朱克川）平壤市数万名青年学生今晚在市中心的金日成广场举行了一次名为“为了和平和没有核武器的世界青年学生火炬游行”。这是朝鲜为迎接在平壤举行的第13届世界青年联欢节而准备重大庆祝活动之一。
    朝鲜党和国家领导人李钟玉和作为本届联欢节的荣誉客人应邀来平壤访问的一些国家的领导人观看了今天的游行。从汉城来平壤参观联欢节的南朝鲜学生组织代表林秀京也参加了今天的火炬游行。
