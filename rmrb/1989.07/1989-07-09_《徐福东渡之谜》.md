The article discusses the mystery surrounding Xu Fu's eastward voyage to Japan over 2,200 years ago. China has records in the "Records of the Grand Historian" by Sima Qian, and Japan has the Xu Fu tomb in Shimaguni City. Due to the vague records in the "Records of the Grand Historian," scholars in both China and Japan have differing views. Some believe that Xu Fu never existed and the eastward voyage is a myth, while others confirm that Xu Fu's voyage was successful. In 1982, during a place name survey in Gan Yu County, Jiangsu Province, Xu Fu Village was discovered, providing evidence for Xu Fu research. China, Japan, and Hong Kong have established Xu Fu Societies.

Did Xu Fu historically exist? Did Xu Fu's eastward voyage succeed? As a native of Xu Fu Village, Mr. Yang Bin, after years of research, wrote the book "The Mystery of Xu Fu's Eastward Voyage," attempting to unravel this ancient mystery.

The author examined various versions of family genealogies preserved by different clans in Xu Fu Village, Gan Yu County, particularly the "Yi Jing Tang · Hou Xu Fu · Wei Clan Genealogy" revised during the 49th year of the Qianlong reign. This not only confirmed that the inscription "Xu Fu Village" written by Mr. Zhao Pu Chu in 1985 is accurate but also verified that Xu Fu's ancestral home was established during the Qin Dynasty. Through extensive research, the author also traced Xu Fu's lineage, proposing that Xu Fu was the 29th generation descendant of Xu Yan Wang (named Chan) from the time of King Mu of Zhou, and that Xu Chan was the 32nd generation descendant of Ru Mu, who was enfeoffed in Xu by King Qi of Xia. Ru Mu was the son of Bo Yi, who assisted King Yu of Xia in flood control.

Regarding the motive for Xu Fu's eastward voyage, it has been traditionally believed, starting from Sima Qian's "Records of the Grand Historian," that he sought the elixir of immortality. After detailed research on relevant historical records, the author concludes: Xu Fu was a highly cunning and meticulously planned individual. He exploited Qin Shi Huang's desire for eternal life, using the pretext of seeking the elixir of immortality to actually aim for establishing a kingdom overseas. To achieve this goal, he had previously sailed to scout the area. Nine years later, he led a large expeditionary force eastward to Japan to establish a kingdom. This interpretation is also a plausible theory.

    《徐福东渡之谜》
    关于二千二百年前徐福东渡日本，中国有西汉司马迁著《史记·秦始皇本纪》的记载，日本有新宫市的徐福墓。由于《史记》记述不详，在中日两国学者中引起不同的看法。有的认为，历史上无徐福之人，也无徐福东渡事；有的则确认，徐福东渡已经成功。一九八二年，在江苏省赣榆县地名普查中发现了徐福村，这对徐福研究提供了证据。中国、日本、香港相继成立了徐福会。
    历史上究竟有没有徐福这个人？徐福东渡成功没有？作为徐福乡人的杨斌先生，经过多年的研究，撰写《徐福东渡之谜》一书，试图揭开这一千古之谜。
    本书作者考察了赣榆县徐福村各姓居民保存的不同版本的家谱，特别是乾隆四十九年续修的《壹经堂·后徐福·韦氏支谱》，不但印证了一九八五年赵朴初先生为“徐福村”所题的碑名是确实的，而且考证了徐福故里为秦制。通过对大量资料的研究，作者还排出了徐福的宗亲世系，提出徐福为周穆王时期徐偃王（名诞）的第二十九世孙，而徐诞是被夏启王封徐的若木的第三十二世孙，若木正是辅佐夏禹王治水的伯益之子。
    关于徐福东渡的动机，从司马迁的《史记》开始，历来认为他东渡是为了求仙人神药。作者经详细研究有关史籍，得出结论：徐福是一个极具城府，且计划周详之人，他利用秦始皇企望长生的欲望，以求不老仙药之名，实为到海外去开疆建国为王。为达到这个目的，他曾出海观望勘察。九年后，他率领一支庞大的开疆建国的队伍东渡日本。此说也不失为一家之言。　（俞慈韵）
