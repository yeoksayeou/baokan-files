The two-day 20th South Pacific Forum Leaders Meeting concluded today in Tarawa, the capital of the Pacific island nation of Kiribati. The Tarawa Declaration was issued after the meeting, announcing a ban on the use of drift nets in the South Pacific and adopting measures to control the "greenhouse effect."

According to local newspaper reports today, the leaders of the 15 member countries of the South Pacific Forum signed this declaration. The declaration also called on Japan and Taiwan, which have the largest drift net fleets, to immediately stop using drift nets in the South Pacific region.

Known locally as the "wall of death," drift nets are 80 kilometers long and 15 meters deep. Within their capture range, tuna, dolphins, whales, seals, turtles, and other marine life can all be caught. This seriously disrupts the ecological balance of the region and directly threatens the fishing resources on which the South Pacific island nations depend for survival.

During the meeting, South Pacific nations decided to convene an emergency meeting soon to draft a related convention.

According to reports, the 15 leaders also agreed to raise 6.25 million Australian dollars (approximately 4.7 million US dollars) to establish a weather monitoring network in the Pacific region to monitor the impact of the "greenhouse effect" on the region. Scientists predict that if the Earth's "greenhouse effect" continues to develop, causing sea levels to rise, South Pacific island nations such as Kiribati, Tonga, and Tuvalu will face "submersion," and island residents will lose their "foothold." This has drawn the deep concern of the attendees.

The report said that the member countries of the South Pacific Forum will hold a dialogue meeting with Western countries in Kiribati later this week to seek support for the ban on the use of drift nets and to express their hope for a global ban on drift nets.

    南太平洋论坛首脑会议宣布禁止在南太平洋用漂网捕鱼
    新华社惠灵顿7月11日电　为期两天的第20届南太平洋论坛首脑会议今天在太平洋岛国基里巴斯首都塔拉瓦结束。会后发表塔拉瓦宣言，宣布禁止在南太平洋使用漂网捕鱼，同时采取措施控制“温室效应”。
    据此间报纸今天报道，南太平洋论坛15个成员国的首脑签署了这项宣言。宣言还呼吁拥有最大漂网船队的日本和台湾立即停止在南太平洋地区使用漂网。
    被当地称为“死墙”的漂网，长80公里，拦截面深15米。在其围捕区内，金枪鱼、海豚、鲸、海豹、海龟等都可被捕获。这严重破坏了该地区的生态平衡，也直接威胁着南太平洋岛国赖以生存的渔业资源。
    会议期间，南太平洋国家决定不久将召开一个紧急会议，起草一个有关公约。
    据报道，15国首脑还同意集资625万澳元（约合470万美元），在太平洋地区建立一个气象监测网，监测“温室效应”对该地区的影响。据科学家们预测，如果地球的“温室效应”进一步发展，引起海平面升高，基里巴斯、汤加、图瓦卢等南太平洋岛国都将遭到“没顶之灾”，岛国居民将失去“立足之地”。这引起了与会者的深切关注。
    报道说，南太平洋论坛成员国本周晚些时候将与西方国家在基里巴斯举行对话会议，寻求对禁止使用漂网捕鱼的支持，并表示希望在全球禁止使用漂网。
