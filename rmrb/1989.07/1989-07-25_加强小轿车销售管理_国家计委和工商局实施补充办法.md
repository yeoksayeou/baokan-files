The State Planning Commission and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with relevant departments, have formulated the "Supplementary Implementation Measures for Strengthening the Management of Passenger Car Sales" and recently issued a notice requiring all regions to implement it.

This measure stipulates that the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with the Ministry of Materials and the China Automobile Association, will approve the addition of 29 new passenger car operating entities. Among these, Guangzhou Peugeot Automobile Limited Company can engage in the wholesale business of its own produced passenger cars, which means it can sell in bulk to other approved passenger car operating entities or retail to end users. The China Water Resources and Electric Power Materials Corporation, China Forestry Materials Supply and Marketing Corporation, China Jing'an Materials Corporation, China Tourism Service Corporation, and China Construction Materials Corporation are limited to purchasing passenger cars on behalf of end users within their own systems. The remaining 23 passenger car operating entities can only sell passenger cars directly to end users. Additionally, among the first batch of 56 passenger car operating entities, Beijing Jeep Automobile Limited Company, Tianjin Automobile Industry Company Sales Service Company, First Automobile Works, Shanghai Automobile Tractor Industry Joint Venture Company, and Guangzhou Light Automobile Supply and Marketing Joint Venture Company can also engage in the wholesale business of their own produced passenger cars.

This measure also stipulates that passenger cars seized and sealed by the administration for industry and commerce since February 1, 1989, by non-passenger car operating entities, if local passenger car operating entities do not purchase or consign for sale, with the approval of the provincial, autonomous region, municipality, and planned single-list city administration for industry and commerce, they can be sold once by the original operating entity to end users after paying additional consumption tax.
