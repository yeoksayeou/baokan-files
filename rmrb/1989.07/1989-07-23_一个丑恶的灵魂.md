When the former head of the People's Bank of China in Kunming's Xishan District, Wang Zhengfu, was finally arrested and brought to justice, the people of the Spring City could not help but applaud.

In the autumn of 1986, when higher authorities decided to transfer the 47-year-old Wang Zhengfu from the Agricultural Bank to the People's Bank of Xishan District, he repeatedly expressed his unwillingness to go. Why? Simply because at the People's Bank, he would no longer have the power to directly approve loans. This power was something Wang Zhengfu was unwilling to let go of at any cost.

In mid-February 1989, two business individuals, Li Fengyun and Gui Guosheng, who urgently needed large sums of money to repay debts, sought Wang Zhengfu for a loan and immediately invited him to a grand banquet.

Wang Zhengfu, however, changed the subject and asked, "Which brand of VCR is good now?"

"G-33," the loan seekers understood the hidden meaning behind his words.

"That's good," Wang Zhengfu continued, "I have a V-84 VCR. I'll exchange it for your G-33, and I'll make up the difference in price."

The next day, Li Fengyun brought a G-33 VCR worth 3800 yuan from his store to Wang's house. Wang kept the VCR but did not mention the "V-84" or the price difference. He said, "The district government has allocated 1.5 million yuan for agricultural loans, which can be used to arrange loans for friends. Once the quota comes down, it will be handled."

After handing over the VCR, Li and Gui thought the loan would be secured, but the loan was not forthcoming, and Wang Zhengfu made new demands.

Wang Zhengfu said his family was building a house and was short of 5000 yuan in labor costs, and he wanted to "borrow" some from them. He added, "If it works, I'll help you with the loan within a week."

Li and Gui, desperate for the loan, immediately agreed.

However, Wang Zhengfu then said his son wanted to learn to drive a car, and if they could arrange it, "4000 yuan in training fees" would be needed. Li and Gui gritted their teeth and agreed. A few days later, Gui Guosheng brought Wang Zhengfu a _Driver's Registration Form_. Wang Zhengfu immediately issued a driver training notice in the name of the People's Bank of Xishan District for his son. As for the loan, Wang Zhengfu remained calm, and Li and Gui were anxious, repeatedly treating him to banquets. During a toast in early March, Wang Zhengfu hinted, "Find two girls to play with."

Li and Gui actually found a prostitute for Wang Zhengfu on March 7. Afterwards, Gui Guosheng gave Wang Zhengfu 5000 yuan to make up the "shortfall" in labor costs.

The next afternoon, Wang Zhengfu met with Li Fengyun and Gui Guosheng, insisting that he had only received 3600 yuan the previous day. Li and Gui had no choice but to admit it, promising to pay an additional 1600 yuan for the "shortfall" and 4000 yuan for the "training fee" to pacify Wang Zhengfu.

By this time, Wang Zhengfu's shameful deeds could no longer be hidden. More than ten days later, the truth came to light, and Wang Zhengfu was sent to the detention center.

Wang Zhengfu was so shameless and debauched, relying solely on the power in his hands. He had a few halos: a representative of the Xishan District People's Congress for nine terms and a representative of the Party Congress for four terms. Such a small figure, when his greed and power intertwined, the corruption of our republic's healthy body was not to be underestimated.

According to regulations, as the head of the district People's Bank, Wang Zhengfu did not have the power to directly approve loans. He knew this well, so after being transferred to the People's Bank, he desperately sought loan approval power. He secretly established a "three-person group" behind the higher authorities, directly controlling the newly established urban credit cooperative in Xishan District, effectively making all the decisions himself. With this trick, those seeking his help came in droves.

Anyone who obtained a loan through Wang Zhengfu could not avoid his repeated "inspections." In May 1988, a hardware store obtained a 160,000 yuan loan. Wang Zhengfu immediately took a Phoenix-brand bicycle under the pretext of an "inspection," without paying a penny, and also took the store's issued invoice. In September, Wang Zhengfu took another Forever-brand bicycle, again without paying a penny. After Wang Zhengfu's case was exposed, his home was found to contain dual-cassette tape recorders, electric rice cookers, and a large number of high-end cigarettes and alcohol, all of which were extorted.

In June of this year, the Xishan District Procuratorate of Kunming filed a lawsuit against Wang Zhengfu according to law. As the law is about to pass judgment on Wang Zhengfu, people are also reflecting deeply. In social life, big and small Wang Zhengfus will not easily disappear. The only solution is to continuously strengthen the construction of clean government, eliminate corruption, and unite the people to wholeheartedly build socialism.

    一个丑恶的灵魂
    本报记者　钱　江
    当云南昆明市西山区人民银行行长王正富终于被捕，接受人民的审判的时候，春城人民无不拍手称快。
    1986年秋天，当上级决定将47岁的王正富调离农业银行去西山区人民银行当行长时，他口口声声不愿去。为什么？无非是到了人行不再直接批放贷款。这个权力，是王正富无论如何不愿放手的。
    1989年2月中旬，两个急需巨金还债的商业个体户李奉云、桂国胜找王正富求借贷款，当下以盛宴相邀。
    王正富却岔开话题问道：“现在什么牌子的录像机好？”
    “G—33。”要借贷的听出来醉翁之意不在酒。
      “那好，”王正富接着说，他有一台V—84录像机，“用我的V—84换你一台G—33，我补差价。”
    次日，李奉云从他的商店搬出一台价值3800元的G—33录像机送到了王家。王正富留下录像机，却矢口不提“V—84”和补差价的事了。还说：“区政府拨给我了150万支农贷款，可以在这笔款里安排朋友贷款的事，只要指标一下来就办。”
    送出了录像机，李、桂二人满以为贷款将能到手，谁知贷款没有着落，王正富却提出了新的要求。
    王正富说，他家正在盖房子，差5000元工时费，想向你们“借”上点。他补了一句：“如果能行，一星期内我帮你们解决贷款。”
    李、桂二人求贷款心急，马上答应了。
    不料王正富又说他的儿子想学开汽车，若联系成了，“需要4000元培训费。”李、桂二人咬咬牙又答应了。不几天，桂国胜为王正富拿来了《驾驶员登记表》。王正富即用西山区人民银行的名义为儿子办理了驾驶员培训通知书。至于贷款，王正富还是不动声色，急得李、桂二人又连连宴请。在3月初的一次杯盏交错中，王正富吐了口风：“你们找两姑娘来玩玩。”李、桂二人居然在3月7日找来一名暗娼交给王正富。事后，桂国胜又将5000元交给了王正富填补所差的“工时费”。
    谁知王正富第二天下午找到李奉云和桂国胜，一口咬定昨天所收仅为3600元。李、桂有苦难言，硬着头皮承认下来，答应再付1600元的“缺额”和4000元的“培训费”才将王正富哄了回去。
    到了这个时候，王正富的可耻行径已经难以隐瞒。10余天后东窗事发，王正富进了看守所。
    王正富如此肆无忌惮、荒淫无耻，所凭仗的无非是手中的那点权力。说起来，他身上还有那么几个光环：西山区的九届人大代表和四届党代会的代表。这么个小人物，当他的贪婪和权力纠缠到一起时，对我们共和国健康肌体的腐蚀却是不容小视的。
    按照规定，作为区人民银行行长，王正富没有直接审批贷款的权力。他深知这一点，所以调到人行之后，就拚命抓批贷权。他背着上级领导，成立了一个“三人小组”，直接控制了西山区新建的城市信用社，实际上是他一个人说了算。靠这一手，求他的人络绎不绝。
    谁要是通过王正富得到了贷款，免不了迎来王正富的连番“考察”。1988年5月，一家五金商店得到了16万元的贷款。王正富即以“检查”为名前去拿走一辆凤凰牌自行车，分文不付，还索走店里开出的发票。9月，王正富又拿走永久牌自行车一辆，照例不付一分钱。王正富案发之后，从他家中发现了双卡录音机、电饭煲和为数甚多的名烟名酒，都是索贿而来的。
    今年6月，昆明西山区检察院依法对王正富提出起诉。在法律即将对王正富作出宣判的时候，人们也在进行着深思。在社会生活中，大大小小的王正富们不会轻易地销声匿迹，解决的办法只能是不断加强廉政建设，清除腐败现象，使人民团结起来，万众一心地进行社会主义建设。
