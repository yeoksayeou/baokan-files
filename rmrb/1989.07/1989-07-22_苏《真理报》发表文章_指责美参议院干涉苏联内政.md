	Soviet Pravda published an article on July 22, criticizing a resolution passed by the U.S. Senate on July 19 regarding the Nagorno-Karabakh issue. The article accused the Senate of interfering in Soviet internal affairs.

	The article, written by political observer Korionov, pointed out that while U.S. senators appeared to be concerned about the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh, their true intention was to undermine the foundation of the Soviet multi-ethnic family.

	The Pravda article emphasized that the issue of Nagorno-Karabakh is purely an internal matter of the Soviet Union. U.S. senators have no right to meddle in the internal affairs of another sovereign state.

	In February of last year, Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast within the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic demanded that the oblast be annexed to Armenia. Since then, there have been numerous ethnic conflicts between the two republics. By the end of February this year, the situation in Nagorno-Karabakh had largely returned to normal.

    指责美参议院干涉苏联内政
    新华社莫斯科7月22日电  苏联《真理报》22日发表文章，对美国参议院19日就苏联纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫问题通过一项提案提出批评，认为它干涉了苏联的内政。
    这篇由该报政治观察家科里奥诺夫撰写的评论指出，美国参议员表面上似乎是关心纳卡州局势，实际上是企图动摇苏联多民族大家庭的基础。
    《真理报》的评论强调，纳卡自治州的问题纯属苏联内政。美国参议员没有任何理由染指另一个主权国家的内政问题。
    去年2月，苏联阿塞拜疆共和国境内的纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫自治州的亚美尼亚人要求将该州并入亚美尼亚。此后，两个共和国之间发生了多次民族冲突。今年2月底，纳卡州的局势已基本恢复正常。
