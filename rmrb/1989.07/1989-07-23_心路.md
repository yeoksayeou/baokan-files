The Path of the Heart

Xiāo Xiāo

Before this, I had never thought of writing about this topic. My habit has always been to say whatever comes to mind, naturally and swiftly. It was only after a recent unforgettable journey that I found myself grappling with so many tangled emotions that I couldn't shake off. Thus, there emerged this path, much like the indescribable mountain road by the Ussuri River, which lies quietly before my eyes and flows through my heart on this silent night.

I remember the days when we were still in that small mountain village, unmarked on any map. One evening, the soft glow of a lamp illuminated the small office, the floating melodies of a piano, the weary faces of my companions, and their casual, heartfelt conversations. A thought rose clearly and faintly in my mind—thousands of miles of travel, unknowingly crossed, the landscapes different but the journey the same. I thought back to the road we took to get there, lying still in the quiet depths of the mountains. But those people, like me at the time, how could they have known that one day this seemingly irrelevant road would enter their lives, becoming an indelible part of their hearts? Since ancient times, people have said that life is difficult, perhaps because we never expect anything, yet when it comes, it strikes us to the core. Like that piano melody, you've heard it many times before, in your familiar campus, in your cozy dormitory, by your peaceful desk. Why, when it plays again in that remote and unfamiliar mountain village, does it truly stir your soul, which has been calm for so long? Like those people, you've always casually assumed that you would be strangers for life. How could you have known that in just a few days, you would become so familiar with each other? Like the distant sound of waves in your dreams, how could you have known that one day they would wash over your feet and strike your heart, wave after wave, unceasing? Even, like your heart, how could it know when it would enter that predetermined path, and from then on, embark on a long, involuntary journey?

If only everyone in this world could prepare early for the unexpected, the burden of life might be lighter.

By the stern river of the mountain border, there was once a road, quietly lying in the depths of the mountains. To this day, I cannot write it out, only its steep shadow, in the soft glow of tonight's lamp, crawls from the depths of my heart to the surface, thus naming it the path of the heart.

    心路
    潇潇
    在此之前，其实不曾想过要写这个题目。从来的习惯都是，什么时候想到了什么，信口说出来，来得自然去得也迅捷。只是不久前有了那一次难以忘怀的旅程，有了那么多当时不曾理清今日又挥之不去的繁杂意绪，于是也就有了这样一条路，一如乌苏里江边那条形容不出的山路，在这岑寂的夜里，静静地展现在我的眼前，流淌在心中。
    记得还是停留于那个地图上无以标出的小山乡的日子里，一个夜晚，淡淡的灯光静静地照着那间小小的办公室，照着满室浮荡的钢琴曲，照着同去的人们疲惫欲睡的脸，也照着他们之间信口随心的谈话。一个念头清晰而淡漠地浮上了心头——几千里旅途，不觉间早已跨越，山水相异却是一样的历程。于是又想起了去时的那条路，停泊在寂静的深山里，然而那些人们，正如当初的我，又怎么会知道有一天这条不相干的路要跑到你的生命中来，做你生生不忘的一块心碑？自古以来人人都说世事艰难，也许就难在我们总是什么都不曾料到，却又在它来到之日，触目皆成惊心。就像那一支钢琴曲，你听过许多次了，在你熟悉的校园中，在你亲切的寝室里，在你安宁的书桌边，为什么一当它在僻远而陌生的小山乡里再次旋起，就真真切切地惊动了你宁静了许久的灵魂？就像那些人，你一直漫然地以为今生永远是陌路，怎么想几日间便已相知？就像那遥远的梦里涛声，如何想得到有一日就会漫过你的双足拍击你的心岸，声声澎湃不息？甚至，就像你那颗心，怎么能知道什么时候它会进入那条注定于你的轨道，从此做身不由己的长久远行？
    如果，这世上的每一个人都能早早为那不曾料想的一切准备着，生命的负荷也许就会轻得多了。
    在那条严肃的山界河边，曾有一条路，静静地停泊在深山里，至今我永不能把它写出来，只有它陡陡的影子，在今夜这淡淡的灯光下，从心底爬到心头，由此叫它心路。
