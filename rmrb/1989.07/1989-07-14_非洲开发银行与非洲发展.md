The African Development Bank has been established for 25 years. This largest financial institution in Africa has grown from small to large, with increasingly abundant funds and a growing role. People praise it as the "engine" of African development and the "flagship" breaking waves forward.

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, African countries gained independence one after another. To consolidate the achievements of political independence and develop national economies, in May 1963, the Organization of African Unity was established in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia; in August of the same year, the agreement to establish the African Development Bank was signed in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan. In November of the following year, the bank was officially born in Lagos, the capital of Nigeria, and in March 1965, its headquarters was set up in Abidjan.

The history of the African Development Bank is a history of development. Its member countries have increased from the initial 25 to the current 75, including 50 African countries. Since 1982, it has also opened its doors to countries in other regions, successively attracting 25 countries to join. The participation of countries outside Africa marks a leap for the bank, with its funds increasing from $2.8 billion in 1981 to $6.5 billion. Moreover, the bank established the African Development Fund and the Nigeria Special Fund as its affiliated institutions, together forming the AfDB Group. By the end of last year, the capital of this group had reached $21.8 billion.

The purpose of the African Development Bank is to provide investment and loans to member countries in Africa, or to provide technical assistance, fully utilizing the human and resource potential of the continent to promote the coordinated economic development and social progress of each country, and to quickly change the continent's poor and backward face. The practice of the past 25 years has shown that the bank has excellently fulfilled its mission. When it was first established, it had limited funds and strength, and it was not until 1967 that it issued its first loan of $23 million. Last year alone, it issued $2.2 billion in loans. By the end of 1988, it had provided loans totaling $12.761 billion to more than 1,100 development projects in 49 African countries, playing a significant role in promoting the economic development and social progress of African countries.

Currently, African countries are facing a series of problems and difficulties such as heavy debt burdens, deteriorating trade conditions, rapid population growth, reduced foreign funds, slow economic development, and declining per capita income. Undoubtedly, the African Development Bank has a heavier burden. Facing these difficulties and problems, the bank has not retreated but has exerted all its efforts to meet the challenges and continue to struggle for the revitalization of Africa. The bank's president, Ndiyaye, said when talking about the policies and tasks for the 1990s, the bank will make more contributions in improving project quality, strengthening dialogue with regional governments on economic development policies, governing the ecological environment, promoting the role of women in development, helping the private sector, supporting bilateral and multilateral trade, and achieving African economic integration. He said: "Facing the serious difficulties that Africa is encountering, as long as the member countries of the region and friends from other regions unite and work together, the bank will definitely become a backbone force for African development."

    非洲开发银行与非洲发展
    非洲开发银行成立25年了。这个非洲最大的金融机构从小到大，资金日益雄厚，发挥的作用愈来愈大。人们赞誉它是非洲发展的“发动机”，破浪前进的“旗舰。”
    50年代末和60年代初，非洲国家相继独立。为了巩固政治独立成果和发展民族经济，1963年5月，非洲统一组织在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴宣告成立；同年8月，创立非洲开发银行的协议也在苏丹首都喀土穆签订。次年11月，非行在尼日利亚首都拉各斯正式诞生，1965年3月，在阿比让设立了银行总部。（上图）
    非洲开发银行的历史是一部发展史。它的成员国已从最初的25个增加到现在的75个，除了50个非洲国家外，1982年以后它还向其它地区国家敞开大门，先后吸收25个国家参加。非洲以外地区国家的参加标志着非行的一次飞跃，它所拥有的资金从1981年的28亿美元骤然增加到65亿美元。不仅如此，非行还创立了非洲发展基金和尼日利亚特别基金，作为自己的附属机构，共同组成非行集团。到去年年底为止，这个集团所拥有的股金已达到218亿美元。
    非洲开发银行的宗旨是：向非洲成员国提供投资和贷款，或给予技术援助，充分利用本大陆的人力和资源，以促进各国经济的协调发展和社会进步，尽快改变本大陆的贫穷落后面貌。25年来的实践表明，非行出色地履行了自己的使命。刚创立时，它资金拮据，力量有限，直到1967年才发放了金额为2300万美元的首笔贷款，而去年一年就发放22亿美元贷款。截止到1988年年底，它共向非洲49个国家的1100余个发展项目提供了贷款，总金额为127.61亿美元，对非洲各国的经济发展和社会进步起了极大的推动作用。
    当前，非洲国家正面临债务负担沉重、贸易条件恶化、人口增长过快、外来资金减少、经济发展缓慢、人均收入下降等一系列问题和困难，无疑，非洲开发银行的担子更重了。面对这些困难和问题，非行没有退缩，而是竭尽全力，迎接挑战，为振兴非洲继续奋斗。该行行长恩迪亚耶在谈到90年代的方针和任务时说，非行今后将在提高项目质量、就经济发展政策加强与地区国家政府对话、治理生态环境、促进妇女在发展中的作用、帮助私营部门、支持双边和多边贸易、实现非洲经济一体化等方面多作贡献。他说：“面对非洲遇到的这些严重困难，只要地区成员国和其他地区的朋友团结一致，齐心协力，非行定将成为非洲发展的一支中坚力量。”
