Trademark infringement and counterfeiting have become a major public nuisance, drawing widespread complaints from the public. A meeting held recently in Shenyang, attended by representatives from various provinces and municipalities, concluded that a nationwide campaign to combat trademark infringement and counterfeiting must be launched in the second half of the year.

By the end of June, the number of registered trademarks in the country had reached over 230,000, seven times the number registered before 1979. In recent years, despite repeated crackdowns, cases of trademark infringement and counterfeiting have continued to rise. According to statistics from seven provinces and municipalities, including Liaoning, Henan, Beijing, and Shanghai, there were 2,642 cases of trademark infringement and counterfeiting in 1988.

Li Jizhong, Director of the State Trademark Bureau, told reporters that although local commercial and administrative departments have been working hard to investigate and punish these illegal activities, the trend shows that such activities are still rampant. Therefore, it is necessary to launch a nationwide campaign against trademark infringement and counterfeiting in the second half of the year. He proposed using the media to publicize a number of already investigated and resolved counterfeit trademark cases to create a strong deterrent effect. He also emphasized the need to follow up on leads and continue to investigate and punish a number of trademark infringement and counterfeiting cases. The commercial departments, procuratorates, and courts must work together to tackle this problem.

    商标侵权假冒成为一大公害
    下半年全面清查
    据新华社沈阳7月19日电  记者在全国部分省市商标办案座谈会上获悉，商标侵权假冒成为社会经济的一大公害，群众意见纷纷。会议认为：下半年要集中时间、集中力量，开展反假冒商标斗争势在必行。
    据了解，截至6月末，全国注册商标已达23万多件，是1979年以前的七倍。近年来，商标侵权假冒案件屡禁不止。1988年据辽宁、河南、北京、上海等7个省市统计，侵权假冒商标案件2642起。
    国家商标局局长李继忠告诉记者，商标侵权假冒活动，尽管各级工商行政管理部门竭尽全力进行查处，但从发展趋势看，这一违法活动仍很猖獗。因此，下半年在全国范围内开展反侵权假冒商标斗争势在必行。他提出要利用新闻媒介公布一批已查处结案假冒商标案例，大造声势，震慑坏人；抓住线索，继续深入查处一批侵权假冒商标案。工商部门、检察院、法院要同心协力，齐抓共管。
