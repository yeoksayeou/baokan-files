People's Daily, Mexico City, July 9th, Reporter Guo Weicheng reports: The United Nations and the Nicaraguan government have reached an agreement for the UN to send observers to inspect the preparations for Nicaragua's national elections.

According to news media in Mexico City, UN observers will engage in extensive contact with Nicaraguan government officials, members of the National Electoral Council, opposition party leaders, and the chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission, Archbishop Obando, among others, to understand the preparations being made for the national elections scheduled for February 25, 1990. The Nicaraguan government has expressed its willingness to provide all necessary conveniences and freedom of movement for the observers.

The decision for the UN to supervise Nicaragua's democratization process was one of the commitments made by the Nicaraguan government at the 4th Central American Summit held on February 14 this year. President Ortega formally invited the UN to send observers in March. This move is said to demonstrate the Nicaraguan government's resolve to ensure the transparency of the elections. Last week, UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar announced the acceptance of Nicaragua's request. It is understood that the UN will continue to send observers until the end of the elections.

This is the first time the UN has sent observers to inspect the election process of an independent country. Secretary-General Pérez de Cuéllar explained, "This is one of the measures to support the efforts of Central American governments to achieve peace." The Nicaraguan government has also requested that the Organization of American States and the European Community send observers.

    视察尼加拉瓜全国大选准备情况
    联合国将派员赴马那瓜
    本报墨西哥城7月9日电  记者郭伟成报道：联合国与尼加拉瓜政府达成协议，联合国将派员视察尼加拉瓜全国大选的准备情况。
    据墨西哥城新闻媒介报道，联合国观察员将与尼加拉瓜政府官员、国家选举委员会成员、反对党领导人及国家和解委员会主席奥万多大主教等各方面人士进行广泛的接触，了解为1990年2月25日全国大选所作的准备情况。尼加拉瓜政府表示将为观察员提供一切便利及活动自由。
    由联合国监督尼加拉瓜民主化进程是尼加拉瓜政府在今年2月14日第4次中美洲首脑会议上作出的承诺之一。奥尔特加总统于今年3月正式邀请联合国派员视察。据说，此举表明尼加拉瓜政府下决心切实保障大选的透明度。上周，联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔宣布接受尼加拉瓜政府的要求。据悉，从现在直到大选结束为止，联合国将不断派员前去视察。
    这是联合国首次派员视察一个独立国家的大选进程。德奎利亚尔秘书长解释说，“这是支持中美洲国家政府争取和平努力的措施之一。”尼加拉瓜政府还要求美洲国家组织与欧共体派员视察。
