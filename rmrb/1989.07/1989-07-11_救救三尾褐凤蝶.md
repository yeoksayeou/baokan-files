The eastern foothills of Gongga Mountain, in the Yanzigou Valley, is home to a species of butterfly that is on the brink of extinction: the three-tailed brown peacock butterfly. During the summer and autumn, they fly in groups between altitudes of 2200 to 2500 meters in the forest, darting to and fro. Their graceful, elegant dance, their colorful wings, and their unique three tails add endless joy to the tranquil forest. Someone once described the scenery of Yanzigou with the phrase, "The sun shines on Gongga Mountain, and the butterflies dance in the valley, weaving clouds of color."

The giant panda is called a national treasure because of its rarity, and thus I believe that the increasingly rare brown peacock butterfly should also be considered a national treasure and protected alongside the panda.

In recent years, some smuggling units, organizations, and individuals have come to the mountains to capture brown peacock butterflies for profit. The purchase price for a single butterfly can reach 4 yuan. During the season when the butterflies appear, hundreds of men and women armed with butterfly nets swarm the area, capturing them. This is akin to an impenetrable barrier for the butterflies. According to smugglers, the price of a kilogram of butterflies is equivalent to the price of a kilogram of gold.

The decline in the number of brown peacock butterflies is also due to another reason: local residents digging up the roots and stems of the wood-scented horse chestnut (a type of medicinal herb known as wood communis). The leaves of the wood-scented horse chestnut are the only habitat for the brown peacock butterfly to lay eggs and feed their larvae. If the roots are dug up, the leaves will not survive.

The two main reasons for the decline are: first, the capture and killing of mature butterflies, preventing them from reproducing and ending their lives prematurely. Second, the surviving butterflies lose their material basis for laying eggs and feeding their larvae. These human-induced factors, combined with their natural predators and diseases, will result in the brown peacock butterfly disappearing from our country within a few years. As an ordinary citizen, I cannot bear to see this national treasure disappear in our generation. I appeal to the relevant state departments and agencies to extend a helping hand and save the three-tailed brown peacock butterfly!

    救救三尾褐凤蝶
    贡嘎山东麓的燕子沟，生长一种世上濒临绝迹的三尾褐凤蝶。夏秋之季，它们成群结队地在海拔2200—2500米的林区上下翻飞，穿梭往来。它们轻盈婀娜的舞姿、色彩斑驳的两翼、与众不同的三尾，给幽静的林区增添了无穷的乐趣。曾有人用“日照贡嘎玉生辉，蝶舞幽谷织彩云”之句来赞美燕子沟的景色。
    熊猫称为国宝，是因为物以稀为贵的缘故，因而，我认为日渐稀少的褐凤蝶也应和熊猫一样，同属国家之宝，一并加以保护。
    近几年来，有些走私的单位团体和个人，为了牟取暴利，来到山区捕捉褐凤蝶，一只褐凤蝶的收购价高达人民币4元。一到褐凤蝶出现的季节，每天都有上百名男男女女，手持捕虫网，四处截击，这对褐凤蝶来说简直是铜墙铁壁。据走私者透露，每公斤褐凤蝶相当于每公斤黄金的价码。
    褐凤蝶的减少，还有另一个原因——当地居民挖掘木香马蔸铃的根茎（一种叫木通的中药）。木香马蔸铃的叶片是褐凤蝶赖以产卵和喂养幼虫的唯一栖息地。根茎被挖，叶片何存？
    以上两个原因：一是捕杀成熟了的褐凤蝶使之不能繁殖后代，早早结束了生命。二是幸存下来的失去了产卵、喂养幼虫的物质基础。这些人为的原因，再加上它们的天敌和病害；要不了几年，褐凤蝶的倩影就会在我国绝迹。作为一个普通公民，我不忍心眼看着国家珍奇动物在我们这一代人手中失去。我请求国家有关单位和部门能够伸出援助的手，救救三尾褐凤蝶！
