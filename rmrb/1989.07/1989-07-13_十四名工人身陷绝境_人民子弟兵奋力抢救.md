On the evening of July 9, a factory building in the Datong Township Cement Factory in Xuancheng County, Hebei Province, collapsed, trapping workers from the night shift under the rubble. Upon hearing the news, Li Naidong, the chief of staff of the training brigade of a certain flight academy of the North China Air Force, immediately led over 80 officers and soldiers to the scene at the fastest speed.

The workers were trapped under concrete slabs, and the soldiers could only use their hands to move and dig. Many of them had their hands rubbed raw. After several hours of effort, they rescued 7 workers from the jaws of death and retrieved 6 bodies. By this time, the soldiers were exhausted, but upon hearing that there was still one person who had not been rescued, they bravely continued the battle despite the risk of falling debris. In the early morning, local residents brought snacks and eggs for the soldiers. An elderly woman in her 70s, tears streaming down her face, said, "The People's Liberation Army is truly our people's soldiers!"

    十四名工人身陷绝境  人民子弟兵奋力抢救
    本报石家庄7月12日电　7月9日晚，河北藁城县大同乡水泥厂厂房倒塌，正在生产的一班工人被压在废墟中。北空某飞行学院训练团参谋长李乃东闻讯后，立即带领80多名干部战士以最快速度奔赴现场。
    工人压在水泥板下，战士只能用手搬、挖，不少人双手被磨破。经过几个钟头的努力，他们从死神手里夺回了7个工人的生命，挖出了6具尸体。此时，战士们已疲惫不堪，但当听说还有1人没有挖出时，又冒着塌房落石的危险，继续投入了战斗。凌晨，当地群众为战士送来点心鸡蛋。一位70多岁的老大娘流着热泪说：“解放军真是咱人民的子弟兵呀！”
