According to a report by the Cuban Latin American News Agency, since 1962, American aircraft have flown over Cuban airspace without permission from the Cuban government more than 6,700 times. American military forces have invaded Cuban territory and territorial waters 610 times and 1,320 times, respectively. Calculating this, the U.S. military stationed at the Guantanamo Bay military base has violated Cuban sovereignty on average every 37 hours. This documented record of U.S. infringements on other countries can certainly be included in the Guinness World Records. However, it is a shameful record.

In fact, if one reviews the history of U.S. relations with Latin American countries since the end of World War II, it is not difficult to discover that this northern superpower, relying on its hegemonic position in the Western Hemisphere, has repeatedly infringed upon the sovereignty of countries south of the Colorado River, interfered in the internal affairs of Latin American countries, and imposed its will on others in various ways:

In June 1954, the United States orchestrated a group of soldiers from Honduras to invade Guatemala, overthrowing the legitimate government of Arbenz;

In April 1961, more than 1,000 mercenaries, backed by U.S. aircraft and warships, landed at the Bay of Pigs in Cuba, only to be crushed by the Cuban people and military;

In April 1965, when the people of the Dominican Republic rose up in armed rebellion to overthrow the traitorous dictatorship of Balaguer, the United States sent more than 30,000 invading troops to intervene;

In October 1983, the United States invaded the Caribbean island nation of Grenada...

As for recent years, the United States' blatant interference in the internal affairs of Nicaragua and Panama in Central America is a well-known fact, which has been criticized to varying degrees by the world.

People must ask, how is it that those within the United States who are quick to accuse other countries of violating "human rights" and who proudly claim to be champions of "freedom" and "democracy" remain silent about the U.S. actions of infringing upon and trampling human rights?

    不光彩的记录
    据古巴拉美社报道，从1962年以来的27年中，美飞机未经古政府许可飞越古领空6700多次，美军入侵古巴领土和领海分别为610次和1320次。细算一下，驻扎在关塔那摩军事基地的美国军队平均每37小时就侵犯一次古巴主权。这一记录在案的美国对别国的侵犯行径，很可以在吉尼斯世界纪录大全上写上一笔。不过，这是不光彩的记录。
    其实，翻阅一下战后以来美国和拉美国家的关系史，就不难发现这个北方大国依仗它在西半球的霸主地位，一次再次地侵犯科洛拉多河以南他国的主权，干涉拉美国家的内政，把自己的意志强加于人的种种行动：
    1954年6月，美国策动一伙军人从洪都拉斯入侵危地马拉，推翻了阿本斯合法政府；
    1961年4月，美国中央情报局策划的1000多名雇佣军由美国飞机和军舰掩护，在古巴吉隆滩登陆，被古巴军民粉碎；
    1965年4月，多米尼加人民爆发了推翻卡夫拉尔卖国独裁政权的武装起义，美国派出3万多侵略军进行干涉；
    1983年10月，美国出兵加勒比海岛国格林纳达……
    至于近年来，美国对中美洲的尼加拉瓜和巴拿马内部事务的粗暴干涉已是人所共知的事实，受到了世人不同程度的指责。
    人们要问，美国国内那些动辄指责别国违犯“人权”，俨然以“自由、民主”卫道士自诩的人，如何对美国这种侵犯和蹂躏人权的行径不吭一声？·立中·
