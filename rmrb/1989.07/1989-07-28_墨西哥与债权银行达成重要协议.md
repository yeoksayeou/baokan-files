Mexico and creditor banks reach important agreement

By Guo Weicheng, People's Daily reporter

On July 23, after several twists and turns, the Mexican government and international creditor banks finally reached an agreement. The agreement reduces the principal of Mexico's $54 billion public debt by 35%; lowers the interest rate on Mexico's debt and fixes it at 6.25%, allowing Mexico to pay 40% less interest annually compared to the current rate. Starting this year, creditor banks will provide Mexico with approximately $3 billion in new loans each year for the next four years, equivalent to 25% of Mexico's original debt. Mexican public opinion believes that this will significantly reduce Mexico's net outflow of capital and provide an opportunity for economic growth. President Salinas said that this agreement creates the conditions for Mexico to complete its five-year development plan, but it does not mean that Mexico's economic problems have been completely solved.

The agreement between Mexico and creditor banks is of great significance. Since the global debt crisis, this is the first time that international creditor banks have made such a significant concession to a debtor country. For Mexico and other third-world debtor countries, this is a strategic step.

On December 1, 1988, when Salinas took office as Mexico's president, he proposed principles for Mexico to renegotiate its debt, demanding a reduction in debt principal and interest, a lower interest rate, a reduction in net capital outflow, an increase in domestic investment, and economic growth. Subsequently, Mexico began a "difficult" and seemingly "impossible" debt negotiation process. Finance Minister Aspé visited the Group of Seven countries twice to lobby for their support in Mexico's negotiations with international commercial (creditor) banks to restructure its debt. The Mexican government clearly stated that the debt problem could not be solved by borrowing new money to pay off old debts but must be solved through debt reduction. This principle was acknowledged and adopted by the "Brady Plan." In subsequent negotiations with the International Monetary Fund, Mexico again proposed that the debt problem could not be solved through "stagnation and recession." Debtor countries should regain economic growth. On April 11, the International Monetary Fund, in its agreement with Mexico, abandoned the past requirement for Mexico and other debtor countries to implement "recession adjustments," acknowledging Mexico's efforts in stabilizing the economy and conducting structural reforms, and for the first time acknowledging that debtor countries have the right to implement economic growth strategies. On April 19, Mexico began negotiations with the International Bank Committee. On May 1, the Mexican government demanded that creditor banks reduce Mexico's public debt by 55%, lower the debt interest rate to 4%, and obtain an additional $4.5 billion in new loans over the next five years. Creditor banks considered Mexico's negotiation demands to be "very excessive." Due to the large gap between the two sides, the negotiations reached a stalemate. Since Mexico was the first heavily indebted country to negotiate with creditor banks after the "Brady Plan" was proposed, the success of the negotiations was a test of whether the "Brady Plan" could be implemented; moreover, Mexico is a neighbor of the United States, and the U.S. government expressed support for the negotiations to reach an agreement, repeatedly intervening and pressuring creditor banks. On June 23, the U.S. government again urged Mexico and creditor banks to reach an agreement as soon as possible and threatened to modify federal reserve regulations to force creditor banks to make concessions. On July 14, President Salinas traveled to Paris and, before the Group of Seven summit, lobbied the leaders of the seven countries for support and, in meetings with President Bush and Brady, "received clear and unambiguous support from the U.S. government for Mexico's debt negotiations." Subsequently, Mexico reached an agreement with Spain, and with the support of the Spanish government, Spanish private banks announced a 50% discount on Mexico's government debt. On July 22, Mexico resumed negotiations with international creditor banks. Due to prior internal consultations between the two sides, the agreement was reached in just one weekend, on the evening of July 23.

This agreement did not meet Mexico's demand for a 55% debt reduction proposed at the start of negotiations in April but considered the actual possibilities of both sides. It shows that both sides made concessions after bargaining. In fact, creditor banks made the first significant concession to a debtor country. From the negotiation process, it can be seen that the concessions made by creditor banks were made under the pressure of creditor country governments and international financial organizations. Therefore, the key to solving the debt problem lies in the attitude and position of the creditor country governments. To solve the debt problems of third-world countries, serious political dialogue should first be conducted between debtor and creditor country governments. Otherwise, it is impossible to truly implement the "Brady Plan"; it is also impossible to continue to make new breakthroughs and progress in solving the debt problems of third-world countries. People hope that the agreement reached between Mexico and international creditor banks will create a good start for comprehensively solving the debt problems of developing countries.

### 墨西哥与债权银行达成重要协议

    墨西哥与债权银行达成重要协议
    本报记者  郭伟成
    7月23日，墨西哥政府与国际债权银行在几经曲折以后，终于达成协议，把墨西哥政府所欠的540亿美元公共债务本金缩减35％；把对墨西哥的债务利率降低并固定在6.25％，与现行利率相比，墨西哥每年可以少付40％的利息；从今年起，债权银行将连续4年，每年向墨西哥提供约30亿美元的新贷款，相当于墨西哥原有账面债务总额的25％。墨西哥舆论认为，这将使墨西哥大大减少纯资金外流的状况，重新获得经济增长的机会。萨利纳斯总统说，这一协议为墨西哥完成今后5年的发展计划创造了条件，但并不表明墨西哥的经济问题已经得到完全解决。
    墨西哥与债权银行之间这一协议具有重大意义。自从世界性债务危机以来，国际债权银行还是第一次向债务国作出如此重大的让步。对墨西哥及第三世界债务国来说，这是战略性的一步。
    1988年12月1日，萨利纳斯在就任墨西哥总统时提出了墨西哥重新进行债务谈判的原则，要求缩减债务本息，降低利率；减少纯资金外流；增加国内投资，使经济重新获得增长。随后，墨西哥开始了一场“艰巨的”、被人认为几乎是“不可能实现”的债务谈判历程。财政部长阿斯佩两次前往西方7国游说，要求它们支持墨西哥与国际商业（债权）银行进行重新安排债务的谈判。墨西哥政府明确提出：债务问题不可能通过借新债还旧债的办法解决，必须通过减债来解决。这个原则得到了“布雷迪计划”的承认与采纳。在随后与国际货币基金组织的谈判中，墨西哥又提出，债务问题不可能通过“停滞与衰退”得到解决。债务国应当重新获得经济增长。4月11日，国际货币基金组织在与墨西哥达成的协议中，放弃了过去要求墨西哥等债务国实行的“衰退调整”，承认了墨西哥在稳定经济，进行结构改革方面所作的努力，第一次承认债务国有权实行经济增长的战略。墨西哥于4月19日开始了与国际银行委员会的谈判。5月1日，墨西哥政府要求债权银行缩减墨西哥公共债务的55％，把债务利率降低到4％，并要求今后5年内再获得45亿美元的新贷款。债权银行认为墨西哥提出的谈判要求是“非常过份的”。因双方差距过大，谈判陷入僵局。由于墨西哥是“布雷迪计划”提出后第一个与债权银行进行谈判的负债大国，谈判能否成功对“布雷迪计划”能否付诸实施是一个考验；再者，墨西哥是美国的邻国，美国政府表示支持谈判达成协议，一再出面干预，向债权银行施压。6月23日，美国政府再次要求墨西哥与债权银行尽快达成协议，并以必要时修改联邦储备条例来要挟债权银行尽快作出让步。7月14日，萨利纳斯总统前往巴黎，在西方7国首脑会议前向7国首脑们进行“游说”，要求给予支持，并在与布什总统和布雷迪的会晤中“得到了美国政府对墨西哥债务谈判的明确无误的支持。”随后，墨西哥与西班牙达成协议，在西班牙政府的支持下，西班牙私人银行宣布，对墨西哥政府的债务打50％的折扣。7月22日，墨西哥与国际债权银行重新谈判。由于事前双方曾进行内部磋商，因此，仅一个周末，就在7月23日的晚上达成了协议。
    这个协议并没有达到墨西哥在4月份开始谈判时提出的缩减55％债务的过高要求，而是考虑了双方的实际可能。表明双方在讨价还价后都是有所妥协的。事实上，债权银行向债务国作出了第一次重大让步。从谈判的过程看，债权银行的让步是在债权国政府及国际金融组织的压力下才作出的。由此看来，解决债务问题的关键在于债权国政府的态度与立场。要解决第三世界国家的债务问题，首先应当在债务国与债权国政府之间进行认真的政治对话。否则，要真正实现“布雷迪计划”是不可能的；要继续在解决第三世界国家的债务问题上取得新的突破与进展也是不可能的。人们希望，墨西哥与国际债权银行达成的协议，能为全面解决发展中国家的债务问题创造良好开端。
