Title: Hunan Faces Large Shortfall in Tobacco Purchase Funds; Half Still Unaccounted For, Tobacco Farmers Anxious

A bumper tobacco crop should be a cause for celebration for tobacco farmers, tobacco factories, and the government. However, in Hunan Province, the main tobacco-producing area, the lack of funds for purchasing tobacco has caused officials at the provincial, county, and township levels to scramble for solutions. Farmers, on the other hand, are anxious because they cannot exchange their tobacco for cash, leaving them without money to buy grain or fertilizers and pesticides needed for late-season crops.

Wang Shuqing, Deputy Director of the Hunan Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and Deputy Manager of the Hunan Tobacco Company, told a reporter that this year, Hunan needs 760 million yuan to purchase and allocate tobacco. By the end of June, the provincial government had initially allocated nearly 400 million yuan, leaving a shortfall of 360 million yuan. Of the initially allocated 400 million yuan, most is just a figure, relying on the recovery of difficult-to-recover short-term loans to have money to pay the farmers, and it is not yet possible to implement it.

The tobacco production in Chenzhou and Lingling regions accounts for 90% of Hunan's total tobacco production. It is estimated that this year, Chenzhou will produce 900,000 piculs of tobacco, and Lingling will produce 1.2 million piculs. Chenzhou needs 250 million yuan for purchasing and 80 million yuan for turnover, but by the end of June, only 15 million yuan had been secured, leaving a shortfall of 640 to 700 million yuan. Lingling needs more than 300 million yuan for purchasing, but by the end of June, only 20 million yuan had been secured. The severe lack of purchasing funds has delayed the opening of purchasing stations; some stations opened for a few days and then closed. In Ningyuan County, 50 purchasing stations had only half opened by the end of June. Due to the lack of funds, the county cannot purchase agricultural production materials from outside, such as the fertilizer and pesticide quotas allocated to Xintian County by higher authorities, which have been canceled due to the lack of funds to take delivery.

The main reason for the severe lack of funds for purchasing tobacco in Hunan is the unreasonable use of funds. For example, the Hunan Provincial Government allocated 257.6 million yuan for purchasing tobacco, but the funds come from the Agricultural Bank recovering overdue short-term loans. Currently, there are many "triangular debts," and some enterprises have accumulated products, making it difficult to recover short-term loans. Some cigarette factories have not yet repaid the tobacco funds owed to the tobacco-producing areas last year, and most of the 257.6 million yuan in funds are not realized.

Officials and farmers in the tobacco-producing areas hope that various levels of government will urge relevant enterprises to repay their debts. At the same time, they hope that higher-level governments will find ways to mobilize funds and take comprehensive measures to raise as much tobacco funds as possible to help the tobacco-producing areas overcome the purchasing difficulties.

### 湖南烟叶收购资金缺口大  半数尚无着落　烟农心急如焚

    湖南烟叶收购资金缺口大
    半数尚无着落　烟农心急如焚
    烟叶丰收，对烟农、烟厂和政府来说，应该说是一件乐事。但在烤烟主产区湖南省，由于收购资金奇缺，地、县、乡各级干部为收购资金急得团团转；农民则为生产出来的烤烟换不到现金，无钱买粮，无钱买晚造生产所需化肥农药而心急如焚。
    湖南省烟草专卖局副局长、省烟草公司副经理王树青告诉记者，今年湖南烟草收购和调拨需要7.6亿元资金周转，但到6月底，省政府初步安排了近4亿元，缺口3.6亿元。这初步安排的4亿元，绝大部分还是一个指标，要靠收回很难收回的短期贷款才能有钱支付烟农，一时无法落实。
    郴州地区和零陵地区的烤烟产量占湖南烤烟总产量的90％。预计今年，郴州地区烟产量90万担，零陵地区烤烟产量为120万担。郴州地区需收购资金2.5亿元，需周转资金8000多万元，但到6月底，只落实1500万元，尚差6400万元至7000万元；零陵地区需收购资金3亿多元，到6月底，只落实2000多万元；收购资金奇缺，收购点、站迟迟不能开秤；有的开秤几天就停了秤，宁远县50多个收购点，到6月底这个县只有一半开了秤。因为没有钱，县里应从外面购回的农业生产资料无法购回，如上级分配给新田县的磷肥、农药指标，因无钱提货，分配的指标已经作废。
    湖南烤烟收购资金奇缺，主要的原因是不合理资金占用多。譬如说，湖南省政府安排了2.576亿元烤烟收购资金，但资金来源要靠农业银行收回到期的短期贷款，而目前“三角债”多，一些企业产品积压，短期贷款收不回；一些卷烟厂去年欠烤烟区的烟款至今还未归还，这2.576亿元资金大部分不落实。
    烤烟产区的各级干部和农民希望各级政府督促有关的企业归还欠款，同时，希望上级政府想办法，采取综合调度资金等办法，尽可能筹集到烤烟资金，帮助烤烟区度过收购难关。本报记者　吴兴华
