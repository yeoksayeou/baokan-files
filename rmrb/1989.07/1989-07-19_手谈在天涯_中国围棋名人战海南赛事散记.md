In the vast territory of our country, Hainan is an economic special zone with great appeal, but it is almost a blank spot in the development of the game of Go. This is because no high-level Go competitions or any high-ranking players have ever set foot here.

In early July, eight Go players including Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun, along with a group of veteran players such as Chen Zude and Hua Yijang, who are past their prime, arrived in Hainan to participate in the second round of the second China Go Name War to compete for the challenger's cup. These Go masters, with a strong sense of occupying real space, are eager to "occupy" Hainan, this "real space," under the banner of promoting the Go game.

What follows are some fragments from the more than ten days of competition.

Tracking and Pursuit in Sanya

When the Go masters arrived in Hainan, they immediately became the focus of the few Go enthusiasts in the area. In the dining hall, outside the competition venue, on the bus... people kept asking for autographs and photos with the masters. The organizers sometimes had to politely decline to consider the players' rest, but true fans hoped to have a game with the masters.

On July 5th, the players had just traveled 300 kilometers from Haikou to Sanya when a representative of the Haikou Go enthusiasts came to arrange for a teaching game. It turned out that these enthusiasts had already learned about the entire competition schedule and had specially followed and traveled from Haikou to Sanya at their own expense. The organizers agreed to their request.

Many enthusiasts did not want to miss this rare opportunity. After negotiation, the Haikou and Sanya enthusiasts first held a "selection match" among themselves and then drew lots to play in sequence with the masters. Chen Zude, Wang Runan, Hua Xue Ming and others were also inspired by the spirit of the enthusiasts, giving up their rest time, each playing one-on-five, in the Sanya Metallurgy Department Holiday Village Hall with the enthusiasts in a series of intense matches.

Nie Weiping's Joy and Worry

Nie Weiping not only has a group of "Go" admirers but also a group of "card" admirers, and this is also the case on Hainan Island.

From the evening of his arrival in Hainan, Nie Weiping's spare time was almost always spent playing cards. Old Nie is afraid of the heat, and after experiencing the heat of Hainan Island on the first day, he decided to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary. Old Nie is straightforward, and if someone invites him to play cards, he tries to accommodate them.

Someone asked Old Nie about his impressions of Hainan, and he frankly said: "The happiest day was in Dongxing playing 'knock three families,' the scariest thing is going out of the room—it's too hot!"

A Little "Challenger"

The challenger for the second Name War has not yet been decided, but a 7-year-old child from Dongxing came to the venue to "challenge" the masters.

The national team leader Hua Yijang, an 8th dan, agreed to the challenge from the little friend named Fang Qun on the condition of giving nine stones. Fang Qun seriously said, "No, give four stones!" which made Old Hua laugh. Although the challenger eventually lost with nine stones, his confident demeanor and meticulous effort left a deep impression on the spectators.

The blue sea, the silver beach, and the warm hosts left an unforgettable memory for the masters who set foot on Hainan Island for the first time. Chen Zude, the chairman of the Chinese Go Association, wrote "Chess in the Holy Land" as a farewell message, which seems to represent the wishes of all the masters.

Today, the masters' move in Hainan Island is like making an "eye," and tomorrow it will make this Go blank "alive."

    手谈在天涯
    ——中国围棋名人战海南赛事散记
    在我国辽阔的版图上，海南是一个极富有吸引力的经济特区，同时几乎又是围棋运动发展的空白点，因为从来没有任何高水平的围棋比赛和任何一位高段位棋手光临过这里。
    7月上旬，聂卫平、马晓春等8位棋手和陈祖德、华以刚等一批已过风华之年的老将踏上了海南的土地，参加第二届中国围棋名人战第二阶段争夺挑战者杯的比赛。这些具有强烈的抢占实空意识的围棋高手渴望在推广围棋运动宗旨下“抢占”海南这个“实空”。
    这里记下的只是十余天比赛中的一些片断。
    跟踪追击战三亚
    围棋国手来到海南，立即成为当地为数不多的围棋迷们注意的中心。饭厅里、赛场外、大巴上……要求国手们签名、合影的人不断，主办者有时为考虑棋手的休息，不得不客气地“挡驾”。然而真正的棋迷都希望能与国手们手谈。
    7月5日，棋手们刚刚从海口长途跋涉300公里抵达三亚，就有一个自称是海口棋迷代表的人来联系下指导棋。原来，这些棋迷已打听到整个赛程安排，专程从海口跟踪追击自费赶来三亚的。主办者为此答应了他们的要求。
    众多的棋迷谁也不愿放过这个千载难逢的机会，经过协商，海口和三亚的棋迷们先自己进行“选拔赛”，然后抽签按顺序与国手们交战。陈祖德、王汝南、华学明等人也为棋迷的精神所感染了，放弃了午休时间，分别以一对五，在三亚冶金部度假村礼堂与棋迷们展开了一场车轮大战。
    聂棋圣的喜与忧
    聂卫平不仅有一批“棋”的崇拜者，也有一批“牌”的崇拜者，在海南岛亦是如此。
    从到海南岛的当天晚上开始，聂卫平的空余时间就几乎与牌结下了不解之缘。老聂怕热，头一天领教了海南岛的热度之后，就下决心闭门不出，除非万不得已。老聂为人坦诚，有人来邀请打牌，不管是谁，尽量满足对方。
    有人问老聂海南之行的感想，老聂直率地说：“最高兴的一天是在通什的‘敲三家’，最可怕的是离开房间外出——太热了！”
    小小“挑战者”
    第二届名人的挑战者尚未决出，通什的一位7岁的小孩却来到赛场向国手们“挑战”了。
    国家队领队华以刚八段以让九子为条件接受了这位叫方芃的小朋友的“挑战”，方却认真地说：“不，让四子！”惹得老华笑了起来。尽管最后这位挑战者以让九子告负，但他那自信的神态和一丝不苟的劲头却给在场观战的人们留下了深刻的印象。
    湛蓝的海水，银白的沙滩，热情的主人给初次踏上海南岛的棋手们留下了难以忘却的回忆。中国围棋协会主席陈祖德在离别之际，挥毫写下了“手谈在圣地”的留言，它似乎代表了所有棋手的心愿。
    今天，国手们在海南岛落下的一颗“子”，就仿佛做好了“眼”，明天将会使这块围棋的空白“活”起来。
