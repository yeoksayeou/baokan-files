Members of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, attending the eighth session, today demanded a thorough investigation into the so-called "57 NPC Standing Committee members' signatures" incident, to draw necessary conclusions, and to make explanations to the people of the nation. During their speeches, these members severely criticized Hu Jiewei, who was responsible for this incident.

Since the beginning of this session of the NPC Standing Committee, members have been highly concerned about the so-called "57 signatures" incident. The session was divided into four groups for discussion. All members of the third group and many members from the other three groups demanded that the initiator of the incident clarify the relevant issues. During the four group discussions and plenary sessions, many members raised questions to Hu Jiewei, asking him to explain the matter of entrusting the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to collect signatures from NPC Standing Committee members, pointing out that his actions during the turmoil were inappropriate.

On July 4, Hu Jiewei submitted a "Statement on the Signature Issue" to the meeting, requesting it to be printed and distributed as a written speech. The meeting printed and distributed this "Statement." In his "Statement," Hu Jiewei believed that "as an NPC Standing Committee member, whether I personally requested or coordinated with other members to sign and jointly request an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee, it is the right of the Standing Committee members, it is the fulfillment of the sacred duty of the Standing Committee members, and it is reasonable and legal."

In his "Statement," Hu Jiewei explained: In late May, he entrusted the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to collect signatures from NPC Standing Committee members, proposing to hold an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee from May 24 to 26, "to discuss the current severe situation and seek correct solutions to the current crisis in China through legal channels." He said: "The signature letter does not contain the content of 'removing Li Peng.'"

Regarding why he entrusted the Four Communications Research Institute instead of the NPC Standing Committee's Office to handle the matter, Hu Jiewei said: "I never thought of entrusting the Office." "At that time, I had a relatively good impression of the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute," "having the Four Communications Research Institute handle this matter was considered ideal at the time."

Hu Jiewei's "Statement" mentioned that after collecting the signatures, the Four Communications Research Institute sent the signature letter to major news agencies in Beijing and the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po's correspondent in Beijing, but Beijing news agencies did not publish or broadcast it, and it was not only sent to the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po.

Hu Jiewei's "Statement" also mentioned several errors that occurred as a result:

1. The Hong Kong Wen Wei Po did not publish the original text of our signature letter but instead had its reporter write a news article. The errors in this news article were:
	1. It stated that we requested an emergency meeting to remove Li Peng, which was completely fabricated.
	2. It combined the signatures from three different times (24 people, 12 people, and 38 people) and claimed it was 57 Standing Committee members signing, which was not true.
	3. The 38 signatures included a statement: "Regarding this proposal, Vice Chairman Zhou Guocheng, Li Gui, Wang Houde, Gao Dengbang, Li Qi, Li Xuezhi, Song Ruyuan, Yang Haibo, and other members expressed agreement over the phone." This already misrepresented some members who did not agree over the phone as agreeing, and the Wen Wei Po further misrepresented the phone agreement as "signatures," making the error even worse.
	4. It included "Gu Ming," who was not on the signature list, in the signature list.

2. The errors made by the Four Communications Research Institute were:
	1. Some members who did not agree to sign were listed as having signed.
	2. Some members who did not agree over the phone were listed as agreeing.

In his "Statement," Hu Jiewei discussed his mistakes and responsibilities: In this incident of collecting signatures to request an emergency meeting, I made mistakes and there are lessons to be learned: 1. At that time, I only affirmed the mainstream of the student movement and lacked vigilance against the few people with ulterior motives, and I did not seriously consider the political implications of entrusting the Four Communications Research Institute. 2. At that time, I did not go out and could not see any situation, and I did not know about the posters on the streets or the broadcasts at Tiananmen Square, so I did not connect my collection of signatures with the special situation at the time, nor did I seriously consider it. 3. After entrusting the Four Communications Research Institute, I let it go and did not prevent some possible errors. For example, I did not instruct them to strictly respect the opinions of the Standing Committee members and absolutely not to force anyone to sign; I did not instruct them not to pursue the number of signatures, and to accept whatever number they could get. It is said that some people had already politely refused, but they still called repeatedly to seek signatures; some people who actually did not agree were also listed as agreeing, etc. Again, after the signature letter was handed over to me, I did not verify it one by one and completely believed them. Regarding the 38 signatures, an additional sentence was added that 8 people agreed over the phone, which I felt was inappropriate, and I asked them to remove it, but they said it had already been printed and changing it would take more time, so I did not insist on my opinion and kept it. Again, regarding sending telegrams to Standing Committee members in other provinces to seek their opinions, I did not inquire about the details of the telegram content and the replies. I am responsible for these errors.

He said: Although these errors were made by the Wen Wei Po and the Four Communications Research Institute, I did not know about them beforehand, and I repeatedly asked them to correct them afterwards, but the resulting infringement and interference with the rights of some members, I also have some responsibility. Here, I would like to express my apologies to these members.

Hu Jiewei said that even today, I still believe that what I did at that time was completely appropriate, legal, and necessary.

In his "Statement," Hu Jiewei said: As for the statement that "the instigators of the turmoil's important strategy is to force the NPC Standing Committee to hold an emergency meeting, make a decision to revoke the State Council's martial law order, and further convene a special session of the National People's Congress to remove the current government," that is their conspiracy. I believe that the NPC Standing Committee is the highest organ of state power, and the Standing Committee members are conscious and capable, responsible to the Party and the people, and will not be coerced or deceived by anyone to do something against the will of the Party and the people.

Today, Zhang Chengxian made a speech at the plenary session, saying that in the process of the turmoil developing from the student movement to the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, after martial law was imposed in some parts of the capital, one of the strategies of the instigators of the turmoil was to force the NPC Standing Committee to hold an emergency meeting, make a decision to revoke the State Council's martial law order, and further convene a special session of the National People's Congress to remove the current government. Some people from the Beijing Four Communications Company were active in various activities, making connections, collecting signatures from some NPC Standing Committee members, and playing tricks behind the scenes. On May 25, the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po published a news report stating that 57 NPC Standing Committee members requested an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee, with the agenda including the removal of Premier Li Peng, creating a sensation and inciting the overthrow of the current government, causing serious consequences. The activities of some people from the Four Communications Company to collect signatures were entrusted by NPC Standing Committee member Hu Jiewei and conducted in his name.

Zhang Chengxian said that this incident caused a stir at this Standing Committee meeting, and many members proposed to investigate this incident. The Presidium paid great attention to this matter and discussed it. Because some members of the National People's Congress Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee, during the study and discussion of Deng Xiaoping's speech on June 9, had touched upon this issue and submitted a special report to the Presidium, everyone entrusted me to report the discussion situation of the Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee to the meeting. The situation is as follows: On May 20, after the martial law order was announced, one day, the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute sent someone with a draft of an immediate convening of the National People's Congress emergency meeting proposal to Hu Jiewei. Hu Jiewei reviewed it and added a sentence: "If the National People's Congress Standing Committee cannot be convened temporarily, it is suggested to convene an informal emergency meeting of Standing Committee members in Beijing." Hu Jiewei signed and agreed to take the lead and entrusted the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to handle the collection of signatures. The Four Communications Research Institute made connections on all sides, either by phone or by sending urgent telegrams, requesting signatures on the proposal on May 21. Some members saw the proposal and signed on it; some members did not see the proposal, and "Four Communications" signed on their behalf, calling it a proxy signature; some members did not agree during the "Four Communications" phone contact, but "Four Communications" used their names to sign, totaling 38 signatures. The Four Communications Social Development Research Institute also added the members who proposed to convene an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on May 17 and 18 before the Central Committee's meeting with party, government, and military cadres on May 19, telling the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po's Beijing office, Liu Ruishao, that "the number of Standing Committee members who signed is now 57." On May 24, someone from the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute told Liu Ruishao that "this morning I have already handed over this material to Hu Jiewei, and he has written a personal letter to the NPC leadership, and this afternoon I have handed over the letter and material to the NPC Standing Committee." On May 25, the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po published the news report "The letter was submitted yesterday, with the agenda including the removal of Li Peng," and listed the 57 names provided by "Four Communications." Many members were very angry after seeing this report in the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po. Some members issued statements to clarify the facts. The Four Communications Social Development Research Institute and the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po were forced to issue "apologies" and "corrections," but they continued to confuse the issue. Some people from "Four Communications" said: "Gao Dengbang, Wang Houde, Song Ruyuan, Li Qi agreed to hold the meeting over the phone, not by signature," while the above members clearly stated that the so-called phone agreement was completely fabricated. In its four-point statement, the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po stated: "In the report, it mentioned that one of the agenda items was to remove Li Peng, which was based on the opinions of some Standing Committee members and included in the agenda content, which was inappropriate." In the "correction," it actually affirmed it, using ambiguous language, and the means were extremely vile. The Hong Kong Wen Wei Po also cursed the members who clarified the facts as "flip-flopping."

Zhang Chengxian said that some members of the Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee, during the study and discussion of Deng Xiaoping's speech, mentioned in their speeches the issue of some members signing to request an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee. Some signing members talked about the process and their feelings at the time, saying that they felt the situation was severe, and the Standing Committee should do something to ease and stabilize the situation. Liu Dayuan said that no one mentioned removing Premier Li Peng. They were angry that they did not expect that people with ulterior motives would play tricks behind the scenes. After analysis, it was believed that many members signed out of good intentions, and as Standing Committee members, they also had the right to make suggestions. The problem was that people with ulterior motives used the good intentions of the Standing Committee members, played tricks behind the scenes, and achieved their unspoken political purposes. The Four Communications Social Development Research Institute combined the three signatures, which was intentional. The backgrounds of the three signatures were different. The first and second signatures were before the Central Committee's meeting with party, government, and military cadres and the announcement of martial law on May 19; the third signature was initiated on May 21 after the announcement of martial law. At this moment, some people who were behind the scenes in instigating the turmoil, including some people from the Four Communications Company, changed their strategy, shifting the focus of the struggle to the NPC, attempting to achieve their goal of abolishing martial law and overthrowing the government through the NPC. The May 21 proposal said: "At this critical moment, the will of the people should be reflected through legal procedures." This sentence implied the hidden intentions of the instigators of the turmoil. Some people from "Four Communications" made connections through telegrams and phones, and some signing members did not see the original text of the proposal. From this aspect, many signing members were deceived. While the proposal was reviewed and approved by Hu Jiewei, Hu Jiewei also entrusted "Four Communications" to conduct the signature collection activities in his name. Hu Jiewei is responsible for this incident. At the meeting of the vice chairmen of the Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee on June 26 to discuss the special report on the signature issue, Hu Jiewei revealed the following views: (1) He said: "The proposal was drafted by Four Communications, I reviewed it and made some changes, so I should be responsible. Four Communications found me, and I was the first to sign and entrusted Four Communications to conduct the signature collection in my name, so I am also responsible. As for who took the initiative? Four Communications took the initiative, and I also took the initiative." (2) Hu Jiewei said: "Regarding the proposal to convene an emergency meeting, I called the vice chairmen in charge of the work at that time. I said: Now everyone is disappointed with the Central Committee, disappointed with the government, and hopes for the NPC." (3) Hu Jiewei said that history will prove that not convening an emergency meeting of the NPC Standing Committee is a mistake. (4) At that time, we talked about the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po's "correction," which buried a nail, saying that the agenda to remove Li Peng was based on the opinions of some Standing Committee members, which was affirmed in the "correction," and was a frame-up for the members. Hu Jiewei refuted this, saying: "Maybe some members wanted to remove Li Peng."

Zhang Chengxian said that some people from the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute were very active in instigating the turmoil, while Hu Jiewei, in his solemn statement in the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po, highly praised the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute and said that accepting my entrustment to collect signatures this time is praiseworthy. From the above facts, Hu Jiewei made serious mistakes in initiating the third signature to request an emergency meeting of the NPC Standing Committee. This is not to say that a member does not have the right to initiate signatures and propose to convene an emergency meeting, but his mistake lies in colluding with some people from the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute, becoming a flag for some people from the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to achieve their political purposes through abnormal activities, causing serious consequences.

Zhang Chengxian said that Hu Jiewei's mistakes in the signature incident are not accidental, and they are inseparable from the position he took throughout the turmoil and riot. Regarding the editorial in the People's Daily on April 26, "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil," Hu Jiewei disagreed with the editorial's statement that "this is a planned conspiracy, a turmoil, whose essence is to fundamentally negate the leadership of the Communist Party of China, negate the socialist system. This is a serious political struggle facing the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups in the country," and he was dissatisfied with this characterization, holding a negative attitude, and said: "The editorial talks a lot about political struggle, which is completely in the style of Yao Wenyuan."

Zhang Chengxian said that on May 19, the Central Committee convened a meeting of party, government, and military cadres in the capital, transmitting the Central Committee's decision and measures to stop the turmoil and announcing that the troops would enter the city and impose martial law in some areas, Hu Jiewei disagreed. On May 26, after transmitting the speeches of Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, and Yang Shangkun on May 22, which clearly pointed out Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, he said in the meeting to transmit the speeches: "I still agree with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang's speech at the ADB on May 4."

Zhang Chengxian said that at the study meeting of the Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee, Hu Jiewei made a defensive statement instead of a self-criticism. Originally, it was hoped that after studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, he would be touched and conduct a thorough self-criticism. From his written speech at the group meeting this time, he still did not conduct any self-criticism, which is very inappropriate.

Today, Song Ruyuan made a speech at the plenary session, demanding a thorough investigation into the incident of plotting the "May 21" signature letter. He believed that plotting the "May 21" signature letter was not an isolated incident but was part of the conspiratorial activities of the instigators of the turmoil.

Song Ruyuan said that on May 19, the Central Committee convened a meeting of party, government, and military cadres in the capital, announcing the decision to take further decisive measures to stop the turmoil and the troops entering the city to impose martial law in some areas. Zhao Ziyang publicly exposed his support for the turmoil and his attempt to split the Party. On May 20, the State Council issued the martial law order. At this critical moment, some people from Zhao Ziyang's "think tank" came from behind the scenes to the forefront, putting forward slogans such as "oppose martial law," "overthrow Li Peng," "overthrow the pseudo-government," and "return Zhao Ziyang," issuing a "six-point statement," demanding "to disclose the internal disagreements and decisions of the high-level leadership," and "to convene a special session of the National People's Congress." On May 21, Zhao Ziyang proposed to convene an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee during his leave. These situations all show that the reason why the "Four Communications Research Institute" rushed to send the May 21 signature letter was to closely cooperate with the new strategy of struggle adopted by the instigators of the turmoil in this new situation, and to actively respond to the instigators of the turmoil's attempt to overthrow the legitimate government.

He said that in fact, Hu Jiewei had once revealed his purpose of entrusting the "Four Communications Research Institute" to handle this signature. He said that now the people are disappointed with the Central Committee and the government, and they hope for the NPC. At a meeting on May 26, when some members questioned him why he entrusted the "Four Communications Research Institute" to intervene in the internal affairs of the Standing Committee, he frankly said, I agree with General Secretary Zhao Ziyang's speech on May 4, why can't I entrust the "Four Communications Research Institute" to organize signatures? It can be seen that he entrusted the "Four Communications Research Institute" to handle the signatures, which is inseparable from his support for Zhao Ziyang's position.

Song Ruyuan believed that this incident was a trampling on socialist legal system. He said that Article 51 of the Constitution stipulates: "When citizens exercise their freedoms and rights, they shall not infringe upon the interests of the state, society, collectives, and other citizens' legitimate freedoms and rights." Members of the NPC Standing Committee are members of the NPC Standing Committee and have the right to submit proposals or suggestions to the NPC Standing Committee. Members advocating for an early convening of the Standing Committee meeting or not advocating for an early convening of the Standing Committee meeting are their legal rights. However, it is absolutely not allowed for anyone to alter their opinions, and it is absolutely not allowed to use their names. In the signature list compiled by the Four Communications Research Institute and submitted to the NPC Standing Committee by Hu Jiewei, some members who did not agree to sign were blatantly included, and some members' signatures from "May 19" before were "transplanted" over. When it was published in the newspaper, the content of removing Li Peng was added, which was a deliberate infringement on the personal rights of the members. Especially when some members made serious statements, the Four Communications Research Institute still retaliated, accusing these members of being "agreeing over the phone," claiming to "reserve the right to sue." The Hong Kong Wen Wei Po also accused these members of being "inconsistent in their attitudes." In this situation, Hu Jiewei did not defend the legal rights of his comrades but instead issued a solemn statement, expressing his heartfelt thanks to the Four Communications Research Institute and praising them for being highly evaluated in the legal and economic circles. This shows that Hu Jiewei completely stood on the side of those who trampled on the legal system and had indeed gone too far.

Song Ruyuan said that Article 99 of the General Principles of Civil Law stipulates: "Citizens have the right to decide, use, and change their names according to regulations, and it is prohibited for others to interfere, appropriate, or impersonate." Article 101 stipulates: "Citizens and legal persons enjoy the right to reputation, and the personal dignity of citizens is protected by law. It is prohibited to damage the reputation of citizens and legal persons by means of insult, defamation, etc."

The "Four Communications Research Institute" first appropriated the names of some NPC Standing Committee members, then fabricated facts, and damaged the reputation of these members. Some newspapers in Hong Kong also maliciously slandered, saying that these members were "wallflowers," "soft-boned," and had lost their integrity. This clearly shows that in their minds, there was no Constitution and laws of the People's Republic of China, and "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" were merely the banners they used to promote bourgeois liberalization. Once they gained power, the people's democracy, freedom, and personal rights would all become bubbles.

Song Ruyuan said that bourgeois liberalization is the enemy of the socialist legal system. In this turmoil and riot, the instigators and organizers aimed at our country's Constitution and laws from the beginning, trampling on them wantonly and shamelessly. They destroyed the legal system, plunging the capital into a state of anarchy, with the purpose of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. Some people from the Four Communications Research Institute disregarded the Constitution and laws, infringed upon the legal rights of members, and similarly aimed to achieve the purpose of overthrowing the legitimate government. By linking the other conspiratorial activities of some people from the Four Communications Research Institute in this turmoil, the nature and purpose of their forgery of the "May 21" signature letter can be seen more clearly. I fully agree with what Comrade Jiang Zemin said, that all political conspiracies to create turmoil and riots must be continuously investigated and thoroughly exposed, and it is absolutely not allowed to stop halfway. I hope that the NPC Standing Committee will establish an investigation team to thoroughly investigate this incident, pursue responsibility, and maintain the dignity of the Constitution and laws.

    人大常委谈签名事件
    要求成立调查组彻底清查
    新华社北京7月5日电  出席七届全国人大常委会第八次会议的一些委员今天在大会发言中，要求查清所谓“57位全国人大常委会委员签名”事件的事实，作出必要的结论，以便向全国人民作出说明和交代。这些委员在发言中对在这一事件中负有责任的胡绩伟委员提出了严肃批评。
    这次人大常委会议开会以来，委员们对所谓“57位常委签名”一事十分关注。这次会议分四个组讨论。第三组的全体委员和其他三个组的许多委员纷纷要求事件的发起人应该将有关问题说清楚。在四个分组会场和大会发言中，许多委员向胡绩伟委员提出了一些问题，要求他就委托四通社会发展研究所一些人征集人大常委会委员签名一事作出说明，指出他在动乱中搞这件事是不正当的。
    胡绩伟委员7月4日向会议递交了一个“关于签名问题的说明”，要求作为书面发言印发大会。会议印发了这个“说明”。胡绩伟委员在这个“说明”中认为“作为人大常委，无论本人要求、或者联络其他常委签名共同要求召开常委会紧急会议，都是人大常委的权利，都是履行人大常委的神圣职责，是合理合法的。”
    胡绩伟在这个“说明”中介绍：5月下旬他委托四通社会发展研究所征集全国人大常委会委员的签名，提议在5月24日至26日左右召开常委会紧急会议，“研讨当前的严峻局势，并通过法治轨道谋求正确解决中国当前危机的方法。”他说：“签名信并无‘罢免李鹏’的内容。”至于为什么委托四通研究所而不委托人大常委会办公厅来办理，胡绩伟说：“我根本没有想到可以委托办公厅。”“当时我对四通社会发展研究所的印象是比较好的”，“由四通研究所来代办这件事，当时我还认为是比较理想的。”
    胡绩伟的“说明”中说，征集签名以后，四通研究所把这一签名信送给了北京的主要新闻单位和香港《文汇报》驻京记者，只是北京新闻单位都没有刊用或播放，并不只是送香港《文汇报》。
    胡绩伟委员的“说明”还讲到由此发生的一些错误：
    1、香港《文汇报》根本没有刊登我们的签名信的原文，而是由他们的记者编发了一个新闻。这个新闻的错误是：
  （1）说我们要求召开紧急会议是为了要罢免李鹏，这完全是无中生有的。（2）把前后3次签名（一次24人、二次12人、三次38人）加在一起，说是57名常委签名，这也是不真实的。
  （3）38人的签名信后面还加了这样一句话：“对此提议，周谷城副委员长，李贵、王厚德、高登榜、李琦、李学智、宋汝棼、杨海波等委员通过电话表示同意。”这里本来就把有的委员电话也未同意的说成同意，而《文汇报》又把电话同意说成“签名”，就更是错上加错了。
  （4）把签名名单根本没有的“顾明委员”，也写入签名名单中。
    2、四通研究所的错误是：（1）有的委员没有同意签名，也写成签了名。（2）有的委员打电话没有同意，说成同意。
    胡绩伟委员的“说明”中谈到他的失误和责任时说：在这次征集签名要求召开紧急会议中，我是有所失误的，是有经验教训值得吸取的：1、当时，我只是肯定学潮的主流，对极少数人别有用心的阴谋缺乏警惕，对委托四通研究所没有从政治上认真考虑。2、当时我没有出门，也看不到任何情况，对当时街上贴的传单和天安门的广播都不知道，因而对“经济体制改革研究所”等所进行的活动，对四通研究所进行的活动，对严家其、包遵信的文章，对于要求召开人大常委会紧急会议罢免李鹏等活动，我并不知道，因而没有把自己征集签名同当时的特别动向联系起来、严肃考虑。3、委托四通研究所以后，我就放手不管了，以至有些可能防止的差错没能防止。比如，我没有交待他们一定严格尊重常委们的意见，绝不能勉强人家签字；我没有交待他们不要追求人数，有多少算多少。据说，有人已经婉言拒绝，他们仍然一再打电话征求签名；有的实际并不同意也把别人当成同意，等等。又如，在签名信最后交给我以后，我没有一一核实，完全相信了他们。对于38人签名之后，又加上了一句有8人打电话同意，我感到不妥，要他们删去，他们说已经打印出来，改了又得再打印，耽误时间，我也就没有坚持自己的意见，保留下来了。又如，对于向外地常委打电报征询，我也没有过问电文内容和回电的详细情况。这些我都是负有责任的。
    他说：这些错误虽然是《文汇报》和四通研究所造成的，事先我并不知道，事后我又一再要求他们更正，但由此造成对某些委员的权利的侵犯和干扰，我也有一定责任。在此，特向这些委员表示歉意。
    胡绩伟说，时至今日，我仍然认为当时这样做是完全正当的、合法的、应该的。
    胡绩伟委员的“说明”最后说：至于说“动乱的制造者们的一个重要斗争策略，就是逼迫人大常委会提前举行会议，作出撤销国务院戒严令的决定，并进而召开全国人大特别会议，罢免现政府”，那是他们的阴谋。我相信，人大常委会是国家最高权力机关，人大常委是有觉悟、有水平的，是对党和人民负责的，并不是受什么人逼迫或蒙蔽，就会做出违背党和人民意志的事情来。
    张承先委员今天在大会发言中说，在这次由学潮发展到动乱进而在北京发展到反革命暴乱过程中，在首都部分地区实行戒严以后，动乱制造者们的一个斗争策略就是逼迫人大常委会提前举行会议，作出撤销国务院戒严令的决定，并进而召开全国人大特别会议，罢免现政府。北京四通公司的一些人，四处活动，上下串连，征集全国人大常委会一些委员签名，并背后做手脚，在香港文汇报上，于5月25日刊登出57名全国人大常委会委员要求召开人大常委会紧急会议，议程包括罢免李鹏总理的新闻报道，制造声势，煽动推翻现政府，造成严重后果。四通公司某些人进行征集签名活动是受人大常委会委员胡绩伟同志委托，并以胡绩伟委员名义进行的。
    张承先委员说，这一事件在这次常委会上引起震动，许多委员提出应查清这一事件。委员长会议极为重视，讨论了这件事。因全国人大教科文卫委员会部分委员在学习讨论邓小平同志6月9日的讲话中，曾涉及这一问题，并向委员长写出了专题报告，大家委托我将教科文卫委员会讨论情况向会议汇报一下。事情经过是这样的：在5月20日戒严令宣布后，有一天四通社会发展研究所派人持起草好的立即召开全国人大紧急会议的建议书，找到胡绩伟同志。胡绩伟同志审阅后加上一句话：“如果暂时不能召开全国人大常委会，建议召开在京常委委员非正式紧急会议。”胡绩伟同志签名后，同意由他出面，并委托四通社会发展研究所办理征集签名事宜。四通研究所各方联系，或打电话，或发加急电报，要求在5月21日建议书上签名。有的委员见到了建议书，在上面签了名；有的委员没有见到建议书，由“四通”代签，名之曰委托签名；有的委员在“四通”进行电话联系中本人并不同意，“四通”盗用了本人的名义也给签上了名，共签了38名。四通社会发展研究所又把5月19日中央召开党政军干部会以前，在5月17日、18日两次建议召开人大常委会紧急会议的委员加上，告诉香港《文汇报》驻北京办事处的刘锐绍说：“签名的人大常委会委员人数现已有57位了。”5月24日，四通社会发展研究所有人告诉刘锐绍说：“今天上午我已经把这个材料送给了胡绩伟，他已给人大领导人写了亲笔信，下午我已把这封信和材料送到人大常委会。”5月25日香港《文汇报》就发表了“信函昨日已经呈交，议程包括罢免李鹏”的新闻报道，并列上“四通”提供的57人的名字。许多委员看到香港《文汇报》这篇报道后，非常气愤。有些委员发表了声明辟谣。四通社会发展研究所和香港《文汇报》被迫作出了“致歉”和“更正”，但又加以抵赖，继续混淆视听。“四通”某些人说：“高登榜、王厚德、宋汝棼、李琦是通过电话表示同意开会的，而不是签名”，而以上委员明确表示所谓电话同意完全是捏造。香港《文汇报》在其四点说明中表示：“在该报道中提到议程之一是罢免李鹏，这是根据部分常委的意见，行文中作为议程内容，这是不恰当的。”在“更正”中实际上加以肯定，含混其词，手段极为恶劣。香港《文汇报》还咒骂辟谣的委员是“出尔反尔”。
    张承先委员说，教科文卫委员会部分委员在学习讨论邓小平同志讲话时，发言中涉及一些委员曾签名要求召开人大常委会紧急会议问题。有的签名委员谈到签名经过与当时心情时说，感到形势严峻，人大常委会应做点工作，缓和稳定局势。刘大年委员说，没有人说过要罢免李鹏总理的话。他们感到气愤的是没有想到，别有用心的人借此背后做手脚。经过分析认为，许多委员签名是出于善良愿望，作为人大常委会委员也有权提出建议。问题出在别有用心的人利用人大常委会委员的善良愿望，背后做手脚，以达到他们不可告人的政治目的。四通社会发展研究所把三次签名加在一起，是有所用心的。三次签名背景不同，第一、第二次签名是在5月19日中央召开党政军干部会议和宣布戒严令以前；第三次签名是在宣布戒严以后于5月21日发起的。就在这个时刻，在背后策动动乱的一些人，包括四通公司的一些人转换了斗争策略，把斗争的焦点转到人大，妄想通过人大达到其废除戒严令、推翻政府的目的。5月21日建议信中说：“在此紧急关头应通过法律程序反映人民的意志。”这句话的含义包函了策动动乱的人的暗中打算。“四通”某些人通过电报电话联系，一些签名的委员没有见到建议书原文。从这方面看，许多签名的委员是受了骗的。而建议书经过胡绩伟同志修改审定，胡绩伟同志又委托“四通”以他的名义进行征集签名的活动。胡绩伟同志对这个事件负有不可推卸的责任。在6月26日教科文卫委员会副主任办公会议讨论有关签名问题的专题报告时，胡绩伟同志又透露了以下观点：（1）他说：“建议书是四通起草的，我看了又作了修改，应由我负责。四通找我，我第一个签了名，并委托四通以我的名义办理征集签名，我也负责。至于谁主动？四通主动，我也主动。”（2）胡绩伟同志说：“关于建议召开紧急会议，当时我给主持工作的副委员长打过电话。我说：现在大家对党中央失望了，对政府失望了，寄希望于人大了。”（3）胡绩伟同志说，历史将证明不召开人大常委会紧急会议是错误的。（4）当时我们谈到，香港《文汇报》在“更正”中埋下钉子，说罢免李鹏的议程是根据部分常委意见，这是在“更正”中加以肯定，是给委员栽赃。对此。胡绩伟同志反驳说：“也许确有部分委员要罢免李鹏呢。”
    张承先委员说，四通社会发展研究所的一些人，当时在策动动乱中很活跃，而胡绩伟同志在香港《文汇报》上发表的郑重声明中，却高度评价四通社会发展研究所，并说接受我的委托征集这次签名是值得称赞的。从以上事实看，胡绩伟同志在发动第三次签名要求召开人大常委会紧急会议问题上确有严重错误。这不是说一个委员没有倡导签名和提议召开紧急会议的权利，他的错误在于与四通社会发展研究所某些人结合，成为四通社会发展研究所某些人进行不正常活动达到他们政治目的的一面旗帜，造成严重后果。
    张承先委员说，胡绩伟同志在签名事件上所犯的错误不是偶然的，这与他在整个动乱、暴乱过程中所采取的立场是分不开的。对4月26日《人民日报》《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》的社论，胡绩伟同志不同意社论中关于“这是一场有计划的阴谋，是一次动乱，其实质是从根本上否定中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。这是摆在全党和全国各族人民面前的一场严重的政治斗争”的论断，他对这种定性表示不满，持否定态度，并说：“社论大讲政治斗争，完全是姚文元的笔法。”
    张承先委员说，5月19日，中央召开党政军干部会议传达了中央制止动乱的决心和措施，并宣布部队进城将在部分地区实行戒严，胡绩伟同志是不同意的。在5月26日传达李鹏、乔石、姚依林、杨尚昆同志22日讲话明确指出赵紫阳的错误后，他在听传达的会上说：“我仍然同意总书记赵紫阳同志5月4日在亚行的讲话。”
    张承先委员说，在教科文卫委员会学习会上，胡绩伟同志除作了辩解性的声明，没有作任何检查。原希望他在学习四中全会文件后，能有所触动，进行深刻检查，从这次他在小组会上的书面发言来看，他仍然没有作任何检查，这是很不应该的。
    宋汝棼委员今天在大会发言中要求对策划“5·21”签名信事件必须彻底清查。他认为，策划“5·21”签名信不是一个孤立的事件，它是动乱组织者策划的阴谋活动的一个组成部分。
    宋汝棼委员说，5月19日，中央召开首都党政军机关干部大会，宣布了进一步采取果断措施制止动乱的决策，赵紫阳同志公开暴露了他支持动乱、分裂党的面目。5月20日，国务院下达了戒严令。就在这个关键时刻，赵紫阳的“智囊”中的一些人从后台跑到了前台，提出了“反对戒严”、“打倒李鹏”、“打倒伪政府”、“还我紫阳”的口号，抛出了“六点声明”，要求“公开高层领导的决策内幕和分歧”，“召开全国人民代表大会特别会议”。5月21日，赵紫阳同志在请假期间，又提出要召开人大常委紧急会议。这些情况都说明，“四通研究所”之所以要四出奔走，多方串联，打电话，拍电报，迫不及待地抛出5·21签名信，就是为了紧密配合动乱组织者在这一新的形势下采取的新的斗争策略，就是为了积极策应动乱组织者妄图颠覆合法政府的阴谋。
    他说，其实，胡绩伟委员对他委托“四通研究所”搞这次签名的目的也曾经表露过。他说，现在人民对中央失望了，对政府失望了，寄希望于人大。在5月26日的一次会议上，当有些委员质问他为什么要委托“四通研究所”插手常委会的内部活动时，他直言不讳地说，我同意赵紫阳总书记的五四讲话，我为什么不可以委托“四通研究所”组织签名呢。可见，他委托“四通研究所”搞签名是同他支持赵紫阳的立场分不开的。
    宋汝棼委员认为，这次事件是对社会主义法制的践踏。他说，宪法第51条规定：“公民行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。”全国人大常委会委员是全国人大常委会的组成人员，有权向人大常委会提出议案或者建议。委员主张提前召开常委会议，或者不主张提前召开常委会议，都是他们的合法权利。但是决不容许任何人篡改他们的意见，绝不容许盗用他们的姓名。这个由四通研究所汇总的、由胡绩伟委员具名递交全国人大常委会的签名名单中，明目张胆地把有些不同意签名的委员的名字写上去，把有些委员“5·19”以前在别的签名信上的签名“移植”过来，在报纸上发表时又加上罢免李鹏的内容，这是蓄意侵犯委员们的人身权利。特别是在有些委员提出严正声明之后，四通研究所还反咬一口，诬蔑这些委员是“口头表示同意开会的”，声言要“保留诉讼权利”。香港《文汇报》也诬蔑这些委员是“前后态度不一”。在这种情况下，胡绩伟委员不但不维护自己的同志的合法权利，反而发表郑重声明，对四通研究所“表示衷心的感谢”，赞颂他们“在法律界和经济界得到很高的评价”，说明胡绩伟同志完全站在破坏法制的人一边，确实是走得太远了。
    宋汝棼说，民法通则第99条规定：“公民享有姓名权，有权决定、使用和依照规定改变自己的姓名，禁止他人干涉、盗用、假冒。”第101条规定：“公民、法人享有名誉权，公民的人格尊严受法律保护，禁止用侮辱、诽谤等方式损害公民、法人的名誉。”
  “四通研究所”初则盗用全国人大常委会一些委员的姓名，继而又捏造事实，损害这些委员的名誉，香港有的报纸也大肆诬蔑，说这些委员是“墙头草”，是“软骨头”，是丧失气节。这就清楚地说明，在他们脑子里，根本没有中华人民共和国的宪法和法律，“民主”、“自由”、“人权”仅仅是他们大搞资产阶级自由化打出来的幌子，一旦他们得了势，人民的民主、自由和人身权利都将化为泡影。
    宋汝棼说，资产阶级自由化是社会主义法制的死敌。在这次动乱和暴乱中，策划者和组织者从一开始就把矛头指向我国的宪法和法律，恣意践踏，肆无忌惮。他们破坏法制，使首都陷入无政府状态的目的，就是为了推翻共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度。四通研究所某些人置宪法和法律于不顾，侵犯委员的合法权利，同样是为了达到颠覆合法政权的目的。把四通研究所一些人在这场风波中进行的其他阴谋活动联系起来，对他们伪造“5·21”签名信的性质和目的就可以看得更清楚了。我十分赞成江泽民同志所说的，对制造动乱和暴乱的一切政治阴谋，一定要继续清查和彻底揭露，绝不可半途而废。我希望全国人大常委会成立调查组，对这一事件彻底清查，追究责任，以维护宪法和法律的尊严。
