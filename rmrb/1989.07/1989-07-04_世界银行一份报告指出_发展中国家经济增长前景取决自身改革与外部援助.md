People's Daily, Washington, July 3rd. Correspondent Zhang Liang reports: The World Bank released the "1989 World Development Report" today, which points out that the economic growth prospects of developing countries depend not only on their own reform actions but also on the actions of industrialized countries.

The report believes that for those developing countries experiencing economic stagnation, the key to restoring growth lies in continuing or initiating structural adjustment policies. At the same time, industrialized countries can take three measures to help promote economic growth in developing countries. First, while maintaining their own economic growth, they can reduce real interest rates through fiscal tightening and monetary easing policies. Second, they can ensure the success of the "Uruguay Round" multilateral trade negotiations to keep the international trade system open and expand trade volumes. Third, they can guarantee that the international community provides funding and loans to developing countries to mitigate the severe problem of capital outflow. The economic development prospects of major debtors, however, depend on the success of the "Brady Plan." The report emphasizes the necessity of financial reform in developing countries because "finance is the key to investment and economic growth." However, the extent to which the financial system contributes to economic development depends on its ability to improve its own efficiency.

    世界银行一份报告指出
    发展中国家经济增长前景取决自身改革与外部援助
    本报华盛顿7月3日电　记者张亮报道：世界银行今天发表的《1989年世界发展报告》指出，发展中国家的经济增长前景不仅取决于它们自己的改革行动，而且还取决于工业化国家的行动。
    报告认为，对那些经济停滞不前的发展中国家来说，恢复增长的关键因素是继续奉行或着手实行结构性调整政策，与此同时，工业化国家可以采取3项措施来帮助促进发展中国家的经济增长。第一，在保持其经济增长的同时，通过紧缩财政和放松货币的政策降低实际利率；第二，确保“乌拉圭回合”多边贸易谈判取得成功，使国际贸易体系继续保持开放并扩大贸易量；第三，保证国际社会向发展中国家提供资金贷款，以减缓严重的资金倒流问题。而主要债务国经济发展前景则要看“布雷迪计划”的成功与否。报告强调发展中国家进行金融改革的必要性，因为“金融是投资乃至经济增长的关键”。然而，金融系统对经济发展的贡献大小则取决于它提高自身效益的能力。
