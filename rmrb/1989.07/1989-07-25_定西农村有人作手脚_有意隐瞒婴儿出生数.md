Recently, the family planning commission of my county conducted a sample survey of some townships and villages regarding last year's family planning situation. It was discovered that certain villages intentionally concealed the number of births. For example, last year, Chengguan Township's Donghe Village had 20 cases of births outside the family planning quota, but only 4 were reported. There were 8 cases of multiple births, but only 1 was reported. The natural population growth rate reached 30.33‰, but only 6.77‰ was reported.

    定西农村有人作手脚
    有意隐瞒婴儿出生数
    最近，我县计划生育委员会对一些乡村去年的计划生育情况作了抽样调查，发现个别村有意隐瞒婴儿出生数字。例如，去年我县城关乡东河村计划外生育20人，只上报4人；多胎生育8人，只报为1人；人口自然增长率达30.33‰，却只报6.77‰。　甘肃定西县广播站　汪德
