CBS-Sony Group is Japan's largest record company. In its recruitment policy for this year, it emphasizes "selecting the best regardless of school name," which has caused a great stir among Japanese university graduates.

To apply for a job at a Japanese company, one must first fill out a resume and then take written and oral exams. In the education section of the resume, the name of the school one attended is usually required. However, in CBS-Sony Group's resumes for this year, applicants are only required to fill in the graduation dates for elementary school, middle school, high school, and university, as well as any special skills acquired during school, without needing to specify the names of the schools attended.

The company's personnel director explained the reason for this approach, stating that it is mainly to eliminate bias. If the school name is provided, the examiner might be inclined to favor prestigious schools or have a "classmate consciousness." The company's decision to hire is based on the applicant's performance and abilities. Those who rely on their educational background to seek employment will not be hired.

Japan has long been known as a "degree society." CBS-Sony Group's new approach has brought a refreshing breeze during the humid rainy season.

    不问校名　择优录用
  　本报东京7月13日电　记者于青报道：CBS·索尼集团是日本最大的唱片公司。在今年招收新职员的方针中，强调“不问校名，择优录用”，在日本应届毕业大学生中引起极大反响。
    申请到日本企业就职，要先填写一份履历表，然后接受笔试和面试。在履历表的学历一栏中，通常要注明毕业学校的校名。CBS·索尼集团今年的履历表中，只要求填写小学、中学、高中和大学的毕业年月日，以及在校期间的特长，不需注明毕业学校的校名。
    该公司人事部长在阐述这种做法的理由时说，主要是为了去掉印象分。如果有校名，考试主持者可能会倾向名门或产生“同窗意识”。公司能否录用是根据应试者的成绩和能力做出判断，对那种凭借学历求职的人，概不录用。
    日本向有“学历社会”之称，CBS·索尼集团的新做法，在湿热的梅雨季节，刮起一阵清新的微风。
