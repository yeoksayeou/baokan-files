The Communist Party Committee of Shenqi County in Shanxi Province recently took the initiative to revoke a regulation that indirectly encouraged officials to extend their hands upwards to ask for money, and admitted to the entire county's officials that this regulation was erroneous.

Shenqi County is located in the mountainous area of western Shanxi and is one of the 35 impoverished counties in the province. In recent years, under the temptation of erroneous statements such as "having red lights and taking detours" and "officials with clean hands are not good officials," the county blindly learned from other places and adopted the method of extending hands upwards to ask for money. In 1988, it formulated and issued the "Temporary Regulations on Further Liberating Thoughts and Expanding Policies to Develop the Economy." This document stipulates that "for those who introduce funds from outside, 10% of the funds can be rewarded to individuals; for those who obtain project loans from higher authorities, 5% of the loan amount can be rewarded to individuals; for administrative and public institutions that obtain more funds from higher authorities, appropriate rewards should also be given."

Under the incentive of the official document with a red header, leaders took the lead, and "talented individuals" emerged. Inviting guests and giving gifts became "great achievements." Some people took advantage of the situation, ostensibly paying tribute but actually fishing in troubled waters, causing a very bad influence among the people. To eliminate corruption, the Communist Party Committee of Shenqi County openly admitted its mistakes and took the initiative to revoke this document.

### 伸手向上要钱　竟能从中提成  神池县委纠错　清除腐败现象

    伸手向上要钱　竟能从中提成
    神池县委纠错　清除腐败现象
    新华社太原7月1日电　（通讯员胡有恒）中共山西省神池县委最近主动撤销了变相鼓励干部伸手向上要钱的奖励规定，并向全县干部承认这项规定是错误的。
    神池县地处晋西北山区，属于山西省35个贫困县之列。近年来，这个县在“有了红灯绕道走”，“两袖清风不是好干部”等错误言论的诱惑下，盲目学习外地伸手向上要钱的办法，于1988年制定下达了《关于进一步解放思想，放宽政策发展经济的暂行规定》。这个文件规定“凡从外地引进资金的，可奖励个人其资金额的10％，凡从条条上争取到的项目贷款，可奖个人其贷款的5％，凡行政事业单位从上级争取到较多经费拨款的，也要给予适当奖励。”
    在红头文件规定重奖之下，领导先行，“能人”四起，请客送礼成了“丰功伟绩”。有些人乘虚而入，明为上贡，实则自捞，在群众中造成极坏影响。为了清除腐败现象，中共神池县委家丑不怕外扬，公开承认错误并主动撤销这一文件。
