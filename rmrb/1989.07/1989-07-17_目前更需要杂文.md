Since the restoration of the eight-page edition, the number of miscellaneous essays in the "Great Earth" section of the People's Daily has decreased. However, this is precisely the time when miscellaneous essays are most needed. As Lu Xun said, we need daggers and spears. For a period of time (which has not yet stopped and probably will not stop in the future), "Voice of America" has been spreading rumors and misleading the public, just as described in the preface to "The Book of Odes": "Creating falsehoods from nothing, gathering strange tales from overseas." It is truly "just for the sake of a performance, spouting nonsense; why not create illusions out of thin air, conjuring ghosts and demons. Along the way, stealing sheep, like picking up a pair of straw sandals; everywhere, searching for lice, like making steamed buns out of mist." "New tricks with fancy axes, old stories twisted into old chamber pots." "Covering the sky and sea, talking in a tangled mess; appearing and disappearing like ghosts, stirring up the water in six barrels."

In the face of such situations, do we not need to refute, criticize, and fight back?

Miscellaneous essays are scalpels. Exposing the brutal actions and ugly souls of the thugs to the public can prevent kind-hearted people from being deceived and help those who have been misled to wake up.

Miscellaneous essays can also be good medicine. "Good medicine tastes bitter but is beneficial for the illness, honest words may be unpleasant to hear but are beneficial for conduct." Due to the influence of bourgeois liberalization, there are phenomena of confusion between right and wrong, black and white, and unclear truths. Clearing up the confusion in people's minds is not something that can be accomplished in a day or two, so isn't it also necessary to have miscellaneous essays?

Miscellaneous essays have great potential, and now is the time to act.

### 目前更需要杂文

    目前更需要杂文
    人民日报自恢复八版以来，《大地》上杂文少了。然而，现在正是特别需要杂文的时候，用鲁迅的话说，需要匕首和投枪。一个时期之中（到现在还没有停止，大概今后也不会停止），《美国之音》谣言惑众，正如《何典》序中所说：“无中生有，萃来海外奇谈。”真是“不过逢场作戏，随口喷蛆；何妨见景生情，凭空捣鬼。一路顺手牵羊，恰似拾蒲鞋配对；到处搜须捉虱，赛过搲迷雾做饼。”“新翻腾使出花斧头，老话头箍成旧马桶。”“天壳海盖，讲来七缠八丫叉；神出鬼没，闹得六缸水弗浑。”对于这种种情况，难道我们不要反驳、批判，不要战斗吗？
    杂文是解剖刀。把暴徒们残暴的行径和丑恶的灵魂公之于众，可以使心地善良的人们不再受其欺骗，使受蒙蔽的人清醒起来。
    杂文也会是良药。“良药苦口利于病，忠言逆耳利于行。”由于资产阶级自由化的种种思想影响，是非不清、黑白不分、真理不明的现象是存在的。澄清思想上的混乱，要做的工作，也不是一天两天可以完成的，不是也需要杂文吗？
    杂文，大有可为，此其时也。
