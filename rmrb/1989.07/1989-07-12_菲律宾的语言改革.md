Since the Philippines became a colony of the United States in 1898, English has been the official language. Today, although the Philippines has declared independence for forty-three years, English still maintains a dominant position in many political, military, economic, and cultural aspects of the country's government agencies and educational departments. This highly abnormal situation has begun to provoke dissatisfaction among many Filipinos, who are demanding language reform to fundamentally change the dominant position of English in the country, thereby reflecting the true independence and national character of the state.

The representative calling for language reform is a senator in the Philippine Congress. In July 1987, he conducted a wide-ranging public opinion survey and found that the vast majority of Filipinos are deeply dissatisfied with the dominant position of English in the country. Many people believe that English has seriously undermined the Philippines' independence and international status, and some even blame English for being the culprit behind the decline of the Philippines' international status and the deterioration of social morality. In a later report submitted to President Corazon Aquino regarding the results of this public opinion survey, the senator wrote: "This abnormal phenomenon of thinking in our mother tongue but expressing in English not only prevents us from gaining respect from the world and makes Filipinos lose self-confidence and pride, but also hinders the expressive power and development of the Philippine language."

Under public pressure, President Corazon Aquino has agreed to implement language reform. She has ordered that all government departments in the Philippines must seriously use the Philippine language in their future work. In schools, junior high schools have been instructed to implement teaching in the Philippine language, and this has already been extended to secondary education courses. In Philippine universities, except for science and mathematics courses, English will be demoted to the second language of instruction.

The Philippine language, which will officially become the standard national language, is based on the Tagalog dialect of Manila and its surrounding areas. However, in various parts of the Philippines, only 30% of the population uses Tagalog, while the remaining 70% use various other languages, totaling eighty-six. Therefore, the language reform movement currently being promoted in the Philippines faces great difficulties. On one hand, Filipinos have moved away from the era of colonial rule, and based on the experience of other Southeast Asian countries, using their own national language is an important way to enhance their international status, and Filipinos should undoubtedly do so. On the other hand, in the increasingly fierce global economic competition, English is also seen as an indispensable international language. Therefore, many Filipinos believe that the new generation of Filipinos still needs to learn and master both Philippine and English languages, and to distinguish between the main and secondary roles. If uniformity is sought in language, it will be unfair and extreme.

    菲律宾的语言改革
    菲律宾自一八九八年沦为美国的殖民地后，英语便一直作为官方语言。今天，尽管菲律宾宣告独立已经四十三年了，但英语在这个国家的政府机构及教育部门等许多政治、军事、经济和文化方面的支配地位仍然没有什么变化。这种极不正常的现状已开始引起许多菲律宾人的不满，他们纷纷要求进行语言改革，从根本上改变英语在国家中的支配地位，以体现国家真正的独立性和民族性。
    要求进行语言改革的代表人物是菲律宾议会的一名参议员。他于一九八七年七月开始搞了一次范围广泛的民意调查，结果发现绝大部分菲律宾人对英语在这个国家中的主宰地位深表不满，不少人认为英语严重损害了菲律宾的独立性和国际地位，还有些人甚至把英语当作“使菲律宾国际地位下降和社会道德沦落”的罪魁祸首。在后来提交给总统科拉松·阿基诺的有关这次民意调查结果的报告中，这名参议员写道：“以我们的母语来思考却以英语表达的这种不正常现象不但使我们得不到世界的尊重，使菲律宾人失去了自信心和自豪感，而且还妨碍了菲律宾语的表达力量和发展。”
    在民众的要求下，科·阿基诺总统已同意进行语言改革。她已下令，菲律宾的所有政府部门在今后的工作中都要认真地使用菲律宾语。在学校里，初级中学也奉命实行用菲律宾语教学，并已推行到中等教育课程中。在菲律宾的大学里，除了科学常识和数学课外，英语将降为第二教学语言。
    将正式作为标准的国家语言的菲律宾语是以马尼拉及附近地区方言的他加禄语为基础的。但是，在菲律宾各地，使用他加禄语的人仅占全国总人口的百分之三十，其余百分之七十的人使用的各种语言多达八十六种。因此，菲律宾目前所推行的这场语言改革运动的难度很大。一方面，菲律宾人已离开殖民主义统治时代，根据东南亚其他国家的经验，使用自己国家的语言是提高其国际地位的一个重要途径，菲律宾人无疑应该这样做。但另一方面，在日趋激烈的世界经济大角逐中，英语却又被作为不可缺少的国际语言。所以，不少菲律宾人认为，新一代菲律宾人仍需学习并掌握好菲英两种语言，要分好主次。如果光是为了统一，在语言上强求一律，就会厚此薄彼，有失偏激。
