Finance has become the most sensitive regulating valve for China's economic development. Just as braking and stopping are necessary for a moving object, from a certain perspective, it is only with braking that an object can move better.

Since this year, with the economic adjustment and the tightening of monetary policy, the braking function of the financial regulating valve has become quite evident. On February 24, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of Jiangxi Province issued an emergency notice to all its subordinate branches: "Except for coal mines, power plants, fertilizer plants, pesticide plants, grain procurement units, and enterprises in severe distress that cannot pay full wages, all industrial and commercial credit units and individual industrial and commercial households that have borrowed from the Industrial and Commercial Bank must reduce their working capital based on the balance at the end of last year, with industrial enterprises reducing by 3% and commercial enterprises by 4%." This braking measure caused a great stir. Some people thought, "This will drive the enterprises to bankruptcy," while others asked, "Should we still pursue production?"

After 45 days of shock, 4,229 industrial enterprises in Jiangxi Province reduced their loans by 562 million yuan, and commercial enterprises reduced their loans by 350 million yuan. At the same time, the bank recovered overdue loans totaling 658.6 million yuan and handled excess and stagnant goods totaling 1.84 billion yuan. Such a large-scale braking measure made enterprises tight on funds, and some enterprises without economic benefits fell into difficulties. However, from the perspective of the entire province, there was no need to worry about an economic downturn. In the first quarter of this year, the province's total industrial output value and fiscal revenue increased by 10.8% and 5.2% respectively compared to the same period last year. This is because, from the perspective of the Industrial and Commercial Bank system, in addition to repaying 300 million yuan in temporary loans from the Provincial People's Bank, 706 million yuan in loans were also issued with a focus on solving the urgent needs of key enterprises such as coal, electricity, steel, and pesticides, as well as enterprises with good economic benefits.

For enterprises, the bank's braking measure forces them to tap into their potential. At the end of last year, Changjiang Woolen Textile Co., Ltd. had severe accumulation of raw materials and finished products, with unreasonable funds occupying 15.71 million yuan, and this alone required paying 1.78 million yuan in bank interest. In mid-February, the Industrial and Commercial Bank issued a task to the company to reduce loans by 10 million yuan. Facing the pressure, the company looked inward, tapped into potential, and promoted sales. As a result, in March, the company achieved sales of 10.55 million yuan, an increase of 3.5 times compared to the same period last year; realized a profit of 892,000 yuan, an increase of 4 times compared to the same period last year; and the turnover of funds was accelerated by 13 days compared to the same period last year.

Now it seems that adopting both braking and releasing measures, and adjusting with both pressure and support, both giving up and taking, can make limited funds truly optimized, and elevate the economic structure to a reasonable level. This can promote the national economy to enter a stable and efficient development track. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of Jiangxi Province adopts the approach of "first braking then adjusting," emphasizing the braking of general enterprises and focusing on helping enterprises tap into their financial potential, reducing unreasonable fund occupation, and striving to activate funds and increase effective supply. This approach is quite in line with the current reality in China where shortages and surpluses coexist, production capacity is largely idle, and short-line products are in short supply.

    调节阀的制动与松动
    赵相如　熊纲
    金融已成为我国经济发展的灵敏度最高的调节阀。物体在运动中，制动、煞车是必要的；从某种角度上看，有了制动，物体才能更好地运动。
    今年以来，随着经济的调整与银根紧缩，金融调节阀的制动作用看得很明显。江西省工商银行在2月24日向各个所属分支机构发出紧急通知：“除煤矿、电厂、化肥厂、农药厂、粮食收购单位和已经不发全部工资的特困企业外，凡在工商银行借款的所有工商信贷单位和个体工商户，其流动资金一律在去年底余额的基础上压缩，工业企业压3％，商业企业压4％。”这个制动，引起了一片震惊。有的人认为“这要把企业逼死”，有的说：“生产还要不要搞？”
    震荡了45天，江西省4229户工业企业压缩贷款5.62亿元；商业企业压缩贷款3.5亿元，同时银行清理回收拖欠贷款6586万元，处理超储积压商品等总计1.84亿元。这么大规模的制动，企业手头是拮据了，一些没有经济效益的企业是陷入了困境，但从全省来说，经济滑坡的担心没有必要。今年1季度全省工业总产值、财政收入分别比去年同期增长10.8％和5.2％。因为从工商银行系统来说，除归还省人民银行3亿元临时借款外，同时有倾斜地发放贷款7.06亿元，解决煤、电、钢、农药等重点企业和经济效益好的企业燃眉之急。
    对企业来说，银行的制动，逼他们发挥潜能。去年底，长江毛纺织有限公司原材料及产成品严重积压，不合理资金占用高达1571万元，仅此项要付银行利息178万元。2月中旬工商银行向该公司下达1000万元压贷任务。面对压力，该公司眼睛向内，挖潜促销，结果3月份实现销售1055万元，比去年同期增加3.5倍；实现利润89.2万元，比去年同期增加4倍；资金周转比去年同期加快13天。
    现在看来，采取制动与松动双向措施，进行有压有保、有舍有取的调整，使有限的资金真正择优配制，经济结构上升到合理的层次，才能促进国民经济转入稳定的富有效益的发展轨道。江西省工商银行采取“先压后调”，强调压一般企业，重点帮助企业挖资金潜力，压缩不合理资金占用，努力盘活资金，增加有效供给。这一思路比较切合我国目前短缺与过剩并存、生产能力大量闲置与短线产品紧张并存的实际。
