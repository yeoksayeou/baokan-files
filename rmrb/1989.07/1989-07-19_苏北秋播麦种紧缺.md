    There is a shortage of wheat seeds for autumn planting in the commercial grain production bases of Xuzhou, Huaiyin, and Lianyungang in Jiangsu Province. In Huaiyin City, one-third of the farmers in Siyang, Lianhuai, and Huaiyin counties are lacking wheat seeds for autumn planting. If the relevant departments continue to allocate seeds according to the previous year's plan, at least hundreds of thousands of acres of good land in northern Jiangsu will have no seeds to plant during the autumn planting season.

    Since May this year, northern Jiangsu has experienced heavy rains, causing many wheat crops to sprout in the water and some to deteriorate in quality. It is estimated that more than 50% of the households in this township are short of wheat seeds. Local cadres and the masses suggest that the relevant departments should plan to import more wheat seeds from outside; grassroots organizations should mobilize farmers to retain some wheat seeds as much as possible.

    苏北秋播麦种紧缺
    本报讯　江苏省商品粮基地——徐州、淮阴、连云港等地紧缺秋播麦种。仅淮阴市的沭阳、涟水、淮阴3个县就有1／3农户缺少秋播麦种。如果有关部门仍按往年调配计划，苏北地区秋播时至少有几十万亩良田无种可播。
    今年5月以来，苏北地区大雨成灾，许多麦子在水里发了芽，有一些变了质。据估计，这个乡缺少麦种的农户在50％以上。当地干部群众建议：有关部门应有计划地从外地多调麦种；基层组织应动员农户尽量选留些麦种。（耿志清）
