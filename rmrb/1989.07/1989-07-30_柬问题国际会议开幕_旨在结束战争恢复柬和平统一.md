The much-anticipated international conference on the Cambodian issue opened this afternoon at the International Conference Center in Paris. This is the second international conference on Cambodia since the United Nations convened one in 1981.

This conference is co-chaired by French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas and Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas. Attending the conference are representatives from Cambodia, consisting of the leaders of the three resistance factions—Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Son Sann, and Khieu Samphan—as well as Hun Sen from the Phnom Penh government. Also present are foreign ministers from Australia, Brunei, Canada, China, France, the United States, India, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Thailand, the Soviet Union, and Vietnam, totaling 17 countries. Additionally, the United Nations Secretary-General and a representative from the Non-Aligned Movement (Zimbabwe) are in attendance.

At around 3 PM, the delegates posed for a group photo before entering the conference hall and taking their seats around a long conference table. The three-day international conference on the Cambodian issue was thus officially declared open.

One of the co-chairs, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas, delivered the opening remarks. He stated that the purpose of this conference is to end nearly 20 years of war and to restore and promote unity and peace in Cambodia. In his speech, he thanked the attendees for accepting the invitation to participate in the conference, noting that this shows everyone's willingness to contribute to the unity and peace of Cambodia.

During the conference, the delegations will speak in turn, followed by a debate session. According to materials provided by relevant parties before the conference, after the foreign ministers' meeting concludes on August 1, three committees composed of experts and officials from the attending countries will discuss issues such as the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops, ceasefire, international supervision, verification, refugees, and reconstruction of homes, and will draw corresponding conclusions. The entire conference is scheduled to end on September 5.
