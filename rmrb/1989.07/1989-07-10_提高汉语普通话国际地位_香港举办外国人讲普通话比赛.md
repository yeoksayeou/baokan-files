Eight foreigners working and studying in Hong Kong participated in the final round of the "Foreigners' Mandarin Speaking Contest" held today, organized by the Hong Kong Young Women's Commercial Association. An Indian diplomat won the championship.

This is the first time such a contest has been held in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Young Women's Commercial Association stated that the purpose of this contest is to encourage foreigners to learn and use Mandarin more, enhancing communication with Chinese people. Additionally, it aims to elevate the international status of Mandarin by recognizing foreigners who speak it well.

The 40 foreigners who participated in the preliminary round of the contest are currently working and studying in Hong Kong. Most of them expressed that they learned Mandarin out of a deep interest in Chinese history and culture, while others did so due to practical work needs.

	The following correction is made to the article "Half the Time, Half the Task Completed" published on page 2 of the July 2nd edition: "Completed tax revenue of 280 million yuan" should be corrected to "Completed tax revenue of 820 million yuan."

    提高汉语普通话国际地位
    香港举办外国人讲普通话比赛
    据新华社香港7月9日电  （记者钟丽琼）8位在香港工作学习的外国人，今天参加了香港女青年商会主办的“外国人讲普通话比赛决赛”。一位印度外交官获得比赛冠军。
    这是在香港首次举办的外国人讲普通话比赛。香港女青年商会称，举办这次比赛，是为了鼓励外国人多学及多用普通话，加强同中国人的沟通；同时也希望通过对外国人讲普通话的表彰，提高普通话的国际语言地位。
    参加这次比赛初选的40位外国人，目前都在香港工作学习。他们大多表示学习普通话是由于对中国历史文化具有浓厚的兴趣，也有的是因为实际的工作需要。更　正本报7月2日二版《时间过半完成任务过半》一稿结尾，“完成利税28亿元”应为“完成利税82亿元”。
