	The Rural Living Boom
	By Luo Jinbiao, Correspondent

	In Italy, the agricultural workforce accounts for only about 11% of the total employment, but more than half of Italy's population resides in rural areas or small towns. Since the 1980s, there has been a notable trend of "rural living boom." Statistics show that from 1981 to 1987, the population of large cities in Italy decreased from 18.5 million to 18.1 million, while the rural population increased from 27.6 million to 28.71 million, accounting for 50.1% of the total population.

	Surveys indicate that today, 69% of Italian families are more concerned about environmental issues than economic problems. 60% of Italians consider physical health as their top priority, and the allure of money has significantly diminished compared to the past. The majority of those who move to rural areas do so to escape the pollution, traffic congestion, drug abuse, and crime in large cities.

	In Italian cities, air pollution is the primary issue. Heating equipment, factories, and the 22 million cars operating nationwide are the main sources of pollution. Noise pollution is another problem, with 45% to 50% of city residents affected by noise levels above 65 decibels. Additionally, water pollution is severe, with many waterways contaminated by toxic industrial waste buried underground.

	Traffic congestion is another major concern for city residents. Italy has 15,000 public buses, which account for only 25% of urban transportation. Insufficient public transportation and an excess of private cars lead to slow traffic and parking difficulties. Statistics show that in Rome, the average time spent commuting from home to work is 50 days per year.

	The increase in drug users and crime cases poses another threat to city residents.

	Furthermore, the decentralization of industry and commerce is another factor contributing to the "rural living boom." Economic decentralization inevitably leads to cultural decentralization, with rural cultural facilities developing rapidly. Therefore, living in small towns does not pose any inconveniences. Of course, some people also move to rural areas due to the high cost of urban housing.

	Experts believe that the current "rural living boom" is a "period-specific population movement." It contrasts sharply with the mass migration from rural to urban areas during the economic boom of the 1950s and 1960s. This trend is common in developed countries and is continuing to develop.

    乡村居住热
    本报记者　罗晋标
    意大利农业就业人口只占总就业人口的11％左右，但意大利的一半以上人口居住在乡村或小镇里。80年代以来，出现了引人注目的“乡村居住热”。据统计，从1981年到1987年，意大利大城市居民从1850万减为1810万；农村居民则从2760万增至2871万，占总人口的50.1％。
    调查表明，今天69％的意大利家庭对环境问题的担心超过对经济问题的担心，60％的意大利人把身体健康作为第一愿望，金钱的吸引力比过去显著降低了。多数迁居乡村者是为了摆脱大城市的污染、交通阻塞、吸毒和犯罪等问题。
    在意大利城市污染中，首先是空气污染。取暖设备、工厂和全国运行着2200万辆汽车，是主要的污染源。其次是噪音污染，受65分贝以上噪音之害者占城市居民的45％至50％。再次是水污染，许多水道已被偷偷埋在地下的有毒工业垃圾所毒化。
    交通拥挤是城市居民感到烦恼的又一问题。意大利全国有公共汽车1.5万辆，只占城市交通的25％。城市公共交通工具不足，小轿车过多带来行车慢、停车难等问题。据统计，在罗马，每人从家到工作场所花在路上的时间平均每年达50天。
    吸毒者和犯罪案件增加是对城市居民的另一种威胁。
    此外，工商业下放也是出现“乡村居住热”的原因之一。经济下放不可避免地带来文化下放，乡镇文化设施迅速发展。因此，到乡镇居住，并不感到生活上有什么不便。当然，也有些人是出于城市住房价格昂贵而迁居农村的。
    专家们认为，目前的“乡村居住热”是一种“时代性的居民流动”，它与五六十年代经济大发展时期大批人从农村迁居城市的情况成为鲜明的对照，这是在发达国家中出现的共同倾向，且在继续发展。
