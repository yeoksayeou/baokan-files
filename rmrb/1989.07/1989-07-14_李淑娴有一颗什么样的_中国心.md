On June 5 this year, Li Shuxian and her husband Fang Lizhi fled to the U.S. Embassy in China, seeking "protection." This public act of treason was the final stroke in her series of disgraceful performances over the past few years. This stroke stripped away all the disguises she had used to deceive people, revealing her true face to the world.

Li Shuxian has repeatedly claimed to people, "My heart is a genuine Chinese heart." "A true and sincere Chinese heart." The facts have completely exposed the lies in her self-proclaimed beautiful halo. Before this, her numerous anti-party and anti-socialist actions, her incitement of student unrest, and her creation of chaos have all proven that she is lying.

I.
Since 1986, Fang Lizhi, who claimed to want to "dissolve China," has been fervently promoting bourgeois liberalization at various venues in China. Li Shuxian openly declared that she and Fang Lizhi are "kindred spirits," fully supporting her husband's cause. Moreover, she and Fang Lizhi sang the same tune, spreading misleading propaganda against the Four Cardinal Principles. She even went so far as to spread slanderous rumors about the Party and the government to overseas students and visiting scholars. Especially after Fang Lizhi was expelled from the Party and his actions were temporarily thwarted, Li Shuxian became even more active and blatant in her activities. She either criticized the Party's decision as "wrong" and "unjust" in front of Western journalists, declaring that Fang Lizhi was not wrong, or spread news among students that Fang Lizhi was refusing to admit his mistakes, was in good health, and was continuing the struggle. She also used her special identity to expand Fang Lizhi's influence in every possible way. She not only encouraged students to invite Fang Lizhi to give lectures, make speeches, and hold "democratic salons" at Peking University but also "boldly avoided the airport authorities" to arrange meetings between Western journalists and Fang Lizhi, intending to spread the news abroad.

Li Shuxian and Fang Lizhi were so in sync because their reactionary political stances were completely aligned. In September 1988, during a visit by Li Yi, the editor-in-chief of the reactionary Hong Kong magazine "The 1990s," to Fang Lizhi, Li Yi asked, "Li Shuxian is still in the Party, while you will definitely not rejoin. Do you and your wife have different views?" Fang Lizhi replied, "Not at all. In fact, she speaks even more radically. Those who know us understand this." On January 22, 1989, the U.S. "New York Times" published an article by Li Shuxian, revealing her true feelings. In the article, she cursed the socialist system for "suppressing individuality" and said, "Under the name of communism, anything can be done." She also said, "Under the name of the Communist Party, anyone can be killed. Only a few leaders make such decisions." From this, it is clear that she completely adopts an attitude of hostility and absolute denial towards the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party. This is the consistent political stance she shares with Fang Lizhi.

II.
After the spring and summer of 1987, Li Shuxian often appeared among the students of Peking University, presenting herself as a "youth mentor" and "student representative." While gaining the trust of the students, she sought opportunities to stir up trouble, deliberately leading some enthusiastic but impulsive and politically inexperienced students into a dangerous confrontation with the Party and the government, aiming to reap the benefits. Later, she discovered Wang Dan, who was not diligent in his studies but always wanted to make a name for himself politically and had considerable organizational skills. She then colluded with him to stage a series of performances to incite student unrest and create chaos.

On May 4, 1988, during the 69th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement and the 90th anniversary of the founding of Peking University, Li Shuxian suddenly appeared with Fang Lizhi in the university's campus at the Cervantes statue, "meeting with Peking University youth." Fang Lizhi, holding a handheld microphone, boasted, "I am living very comfortably now, and I am welcomed everywhere." He also attacked "socialism with Chinese characteristics." Li Shuxian attacked China for being undemocratic and unfree, declaring, "I am willing to be a grain of sand, paving the way for freedom for future generations." From then on, the "democratic salon," with Wang Dan and others as the core, aiming to spread bourgeois liberalization among Peking University students and gather so-called "democratic forces," began.

In 1989, the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, domestic and overseas reactionary forces all took the stage, colluding with each other, actively working, and intending to use this opportunity to create large-scale turmoil in China. Their evil goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and establish a completely Westernized bourgeois republic. Li Shuxian played a crucial and eager role in this reactionary force. Starting in January 1989, she published reactionary articles in Western newspapers and posted large and small wall posters in places like the Triangle at Peking University, inciting students to cause trouble. On April 5, she and Wang Dan once again led the "democratic salon." Wang Dan, unable to contain his excitement before the turmoil, said mysteriously, "This year is a good opportunity, 'May Fourth,' 'April Fifth,' the French Revolution. According to reason, a large number of reporters will come to the mainland, all hoping that China's democratization will begin this year. Now I hope that everyone will unite at this moment," "I think if everyone is more active, the process will be advanced." The cunning Li Shuxian then talked about "democracy," "science," "freedom of speech," "inclusiveness," and "China's Bruno" from ancient times to the present, and personally encouraged students to engage in "legal struggles," expressing respect for students who dared to cause trouble.

III.
After April 15, 1989, domestic and overseas elements intent on creating turmoil finally used the opportunity of Hu Yaobang's death to incite a movement aimed at denying the Four Cardinal Principles. On the night of April 17, Wang Dan and others incited some students to gather in front of the Great Hall of the People at Tiananmen Square, claiming to submit a "petition" to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The letter proposed seven pre-planned demands, including "completely negating the anti-spiritual pollution campaign and the anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign." By the morning of the 18th, seeing that fewer students were participating, Wang Dan quickly called Li Shuxian for help. After returning, he immediately conveyed Li Shuxian's instructions: "First, persist; second, submit to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress." Li Shuxian immediately wrote a big-character poster titled "The Telephone from Tiananmen Square," in two copies, posted at the Triangle of Peking University, calling on "broad masses of students to pay close attention" and "hoping that broad masses of students will support." Due to her guilty conscience, Li Shuxian did not dare to sign her name.

However, no matter how Li Shuxian tried to cover up, her conspiracies would eventually be exposed. On April 21, a student who had gone through painful reflection and felt that he and his classmates had been deceived revealed the truth about Li Shuxian and others having "pre-arranged the movement." According to this student's revelation, Li Shuxian and others had planned four steps for the movement: "The first step is to mourn Hu Yaobang and, at the same time, put forward our political demands. Teacher Li Shuxian said that we should put the rehabilitation of Hu first, so they won't have anything to say. The second point should not be about rehabilitating intellectuals who were criticized in the anti-liberalization campaign, as that would be too detached from the masses and easily misunderstood, making it seem like Teacher Fang Lizhi was involved, and we should avoid giving the authorities any pretext. Also, the masses hate corruption the most, so don't directly mention opposing the Four Principles, just use this point to attack them. The second step is to sit in front of Zhongnanhai, and if necessary, push inside. As long as the police dare to intervene, it's beating people, which will arouse sympathy, especially for girls, who are soft-hearted, so say the police are beating girls, which can also arouse the 'manly' feelings of boys. The third step is to demand to participate in the funeral, and many people have this psychological expectation, so the matter will be even bigger, and it can be pushed nationwide. The fourth step is to reach the climax on May Fourth. Teacher Li also said to smear the Student Union and the Student Council, so they won't have any help."

This student hit Li Shuxian's sore spot, making her furious and screaming, "Damn it!"

Even after martial law was declared in some parts of Beijing in late May, Li Shuxian still told others, "Tiananmen must not be withdrawn," "The satellite is watching, the whole world is watching." "Beijing might be just a local area, but the country needs a more acute struggle." At this time, Li Shuxian's heart was on the satellite, on the eyes of her foreign masters, where was the "genuine Chinese heart"? What she needed was a more acute struggle in China than the turmoil that had already occurred. This was indeed a heart that brought disaster to the country and sold out the nation.

    李淑娴有一颗什么样的“中国心”
    周彤文
    今年6月5日，李淑娴和她的丈夫方励之畏罪潜逃到美国驻华大使馆，寻求“保护”。这一公开叛国的无耻行径，不啻是为她近几年来的丑恶表演添上了画龙点睛的一笔。这一笔把她用来骗人的一件件外衣统统剥得净光，使人们终于看清了她的庐山真面目。
    李淑娴曾经不止一次地对人们进行这样的自我表白：“我这颗心是一颗道道地地的中国心。”“真正的、诚实的中国心。”上述事实已经完全戳穿了她为自己编织的美丽光环，在此之前，她反党反社会主义、煽动学潮、制造动乱的大量言行也同样证明了她说的全是谎言。
    一
    自1986年以来，声称要“解散中国”的方励之在国内各种场合狂热地鼓吹资产阶级自由化，李淑娴则公开申明她和方励之是“志同道合”的，她完全支持丈夫的事业。不仅如此，她还和方励之一唱一和，进行反对四项基本原则的蛊惑宣传，甚至不惜把污蔑党和政府的谣言造到远在国外的留学生和访问学者中间。特别是方励之被开除党籍、行动一度受挫之后，李淑娴更加活跃、更加露骨地四处活动，她或在西方记者面前抨击党组织的决定是“错误的”，“不公正的”，声明方励之没有错；或在学生之中传播方励之拒不认错、身体健康、坚持斗争的消息。她还利用自己的特殊身份，千方百计地为方励之扩大影响。她不但怂恿学生请方励之到北大讲课，发表演说，举办“民主沙龙”，还“大胆地避开机场当局”，安排西方记者和方励之的会见，以便把舆论造到国外去。
    李淑娴和方励之如此沆瀣一气，根本原因在于她和方励之的反动政治立场是完全一致的。1988年9月，香港反动刊物《九十年代》总编辑李怡访问方励之时曾经问：“李淑娴还在党内，而你已肯定不会再加入党了。你们夫妇之间有什么不同看法吗？”方励之说：“这倒不会。实际上她比我讲得还利（厉）害，了解我们的人都知道。”1989年1月22日的美国
  《纽约时报》发表了李淑娴的一篇署名文章，道出了她的心声。她在文章中咒骂社会主义制度“压抑个性”，“假共产主义之名，什么事都干得出来。”还说：“假共产党之名可以杀任何人，作出这种决定的只是一些领导人。”从中不难看出，针对社会主义制度和共产党的领导完全采取了敌视和彻底否定的态度。这就是她和方励之一致的政治立场。
    二
    1987年春夏以后，李淑娴则俨然以“青年导师”、“学生代表”的面目，频繁地出没于北京大学生之中，在骗取学生信任的同时，寻找机会，煽风点火，蓄意把一些富于热情而缺乏理智和政治经验的学生引向同党和政府对立的危险境地，以便火中取栗。后来，她发现了不思努力学习却总想在政治上出人头地而又颇有活动能量的王丹，便和他勾结起来，演出了一出出煽动学潮、制造动乱的双簧戏。
    1988年5月4日，正值北大庆祝五四运动69周年和建校90周年之际，李淑娴突然携方励之粉墨登场，来到北大校园内的塞万提斯像前，“与北大青年会见”。方励之拿着手提式话筒神气活现地大讲“我现在活得很自在，到处受到欢迎。”并大肆攻击“有中国特色的社会主义现代化”。李淑娴则攻击中国不民主不自由，声言“愿做一粒沙子，为后人铺就一条自由之路。”从此以后，以王丹等人为骨干、以在北大学生中传播资产阶级自由化思潮、聚集所谓“民主力量”为目的的“民主沙龙”就开场了。
    1989年适逢五四运动七十周年。海内外反动势力纷纷登场，互相勾结，积极活动，蓄意要利用这个时机在中国制造大规模的动乱，以实现他们推翻共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，建立完全西方化的资产阶级共和国的罪恶目的。李淑娴充当了这股反动势力中一个急不可耐而又十分卖力的重要角色。从1989年1月开始，她就又是在西方报刊上发表反动文章，又是在北大三角地等处张贴鼓动学生闹事的大小字报。4月5日，她和王丹又一次一唱一和地主持了“民主沙龙”。王丹按捺不住动乱到来之前的喜悦，神情诡秘地说：“今年是一个好时机呀，‘五四’、‘四五’、法国大革命，按理说大批记者涌到大陆来，都希望中国民主化在今年有个开端。现在我希望目前这个时机大家都团结起来”，
  “我想大家都窜腾得比较欢的话，这个过程就推进了。”老谋深算的李淑娴则从古到今地大谈“民主”、
  “科学”、“言论自由”、“兼容并包”、“中国的布鲁诺”，并现身说法鼓动学生进行“合法斗争”，还对敢于闹事的学生表示“尊敬”。
    三
    1989年4月15日以后，海内外蓄意要制造动乱的敌对分子终于利用胡耀邦同志逝世的机会煽起了旨在否定四项基本原则的学潮。4月17日夜，王丹等人鼓动一些学生到天安门广场人民大会堂前，声言要向人大常委会递交一封“请愿书”，信中提出了事先精心策划好了的“彻底否定反精神污染、反资产阶级自由化运动”等七条要求。到18日清晨，王丹看学生愈来愈少，就急忙给李淑娴打电话求救。他回来后立刻传达了李淑娴一要坚持，二要递交人大常委的“两点指示”。李淑娴则马上写了题为“天安门前传来的电话”的大字报一式两份，贴在了北大三角地，呼吁“广大同学密切关注”，“希望广大同学声援”。由于作贼心虚，李淑娴没敢署名。
    然而，不管李淑娴如何遮掩，阴谋诡计总是要大白于天下的。4月21日，一位经过痛苦的思考，深感自己和同学们上当受骗了的同学揭露了李淑娴等人对“运动早有安排的”真相。据这位同学揭露，李淑娴等人为运动安排了四步：“第一步，悼念胡耀邦，顺便提出我们的政治要求。李淑娴老师说，要把为胡平反放在第一条，这样他们就不好说什么了。第二条也别提为在反自由化运动中受挫、受批判的知识分子平反，那样太脱离群众，也易引起误会，好像方励之老师参与了，尽量避免给当局以口实。再有，群众最恨腐败，别直接提反四条（四项基本原则），就用这一点攻他们。第二步则到新华门静坐，必要时往里挤，只要警察敢管，就是打人，这样才能唤起同情心，特别是女生，心软，就说警察专打女生，也能引起男生的‘汉子感’。第三步，要求参加追悼会，很多人有这个心理，这样事情就更大了，还能推向全国。第四步，五四达到最高潮。李老师还说，要搞臭团委、学生会，这样他们就没帮手了。”
    这一学生戳到了李淑娴的痛处，她气急败坏，暴跳如雷，竟当着来访同学的面破口大骂：“他妈的！”
    直到北京部分地区宣布戒严以后，5月下旬，李淑娴还对别人说：“天安门绝对不能撤”，“卫星在看，全世界在看。”“北京也可能是个局部，而全国需要一个更尖锐的斗争。”这时候的李淑娴，她的心，就挂在卫星上，挂在她的外国主子的眼色上，哪里还是什么“道道地地的中国心”？她需要的，是在中国发生比当时已经发生的动乱“更尖锐的斗争”。这实在是一颗道道地地的祸国之心，卖国之心。
