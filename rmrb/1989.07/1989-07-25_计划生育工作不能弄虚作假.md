    Family planning work must not be falsified. The current policy of family planning in our country is: to advocate late marriage and late childbearing, to have fewer but better children, and to advocate that one couple has only one child. State cadres and staff, urban residents, except in special cases with approval, have only one child per couple; in rural areas, some people have real difficulties, including those with only one daughter, who need to have a second child after a few years with approval. In any case, three children are not allowed. The state formulates this policy to curb the rapid growth of the population in our country, to make the quantity of means of production match the quantity of laborers, the technical structure of means of production match the quality of laborers, and the quantity of the total population match the quantity of means of subsistence. If the population growth exceeds the limit that the country's resources and economic capacity can bear, it will bring poverty, diseases, and a series of difficulties that are hard to solve, directly affecting the improvement of people's lives and the realization of the country's goals.

    Due to years of work and the general concern of the masses, the current family planning policy in our country can be said to be well-known to every household and known to everyone. However, the situation of implementation in various places is not balanced. The most serious problem at present is the overproduction of multiple births. There are those who have two or three children, and there are also those who have four, five, or even more. They use open or covert methods to have more children, interfering with the development of family planning work. The masses are very dissatisfied with this. However, what is more worrying and infuriating is that, in the face of this phenomenon of multiple births, some places do not try to stop it but instead focus on how to falsify reports to higher authorities. From their statistics, the overproduced population is not on the books, but in fact, the population has increased, resulting in increased market consumption and national burdens. Falsifying family planning work not only deceives oneself and others but also harms the country and the people.

    These years are the peak marriage and childbearing period in our country. We must make great efforts, use administrative, economic, and legal means to do a good job in family planning, and resolutely reduce the population growth rate. For those who falsify family planning work, we must expose and seriously deal with them, and we must not let them develop further, delaying our country, nation, and future.

### 计划生育工作不能弄虚作假

    计划生育工作不能弄虚作假
    我国计划生育工作的现行政策是：提倡晚婚晚育、少生优生，提倡一对夫妇只生一个孩子，国家干部和职工、城镇居民除特殊情况经过批准外，一对夫妇只生一个孩子；农村某些群众确有实际困难，包括独女户，要求生二胎的，经过批准可以间隔几年以后生第二胎；不论哪种情况都不能生三胎。国家制定这个政策是为了遏制我国人口的过快增长，使生产资料的数量与劳动者的数量相适应，生产资料的技术结构与劳动者的素质相适应，总人口的数量与生活资料的数量相适应。如果人口的增长超过了国家资源和经济能力所承受的限度，就会带来贫穷、疾病和一系列难以解决的困难，直接影响到人民生活的改善和国家奋斗目标的实现。
    由于多年来的工作和群众的普遍关心，我国现行的计划生育政策可以说是家喻户晓、人人皆知了。但各地执行的情况却不平衡。目前最严重的问题是多胎超生。有超生二个、三个的，也有超生四个、五个甚至更多的。他们为了超生，采取了公开的或隐蔽的办法，干扰了计划生育工作的开展。群众对此十分不满。然而，更令人忧虑和气愤的是，面对这种多胎超生的现象，有的地方不是想办法去制止，而是把心思用在向上级汇报时如何弄虚作假上。从他们的报表上看，超生人口并不在册，但实际上增加了人口，结果市场消费、国家负担也随之加大。在计划生育工作中弄虚作假，不仅自欺欺人，而且坑国害民。
    这几年是我国的婚育高峰期。我们一定要下大气力，运用行政的、经济的、法律的手段，做好计划生育工作，坚决把人口增长速度降下来。对于那些在计划生育工作中弄虚作假的人和事，必须揭露，严肃处理，绝不能任其发展下去，贻误我们的国家、民族和未来。
