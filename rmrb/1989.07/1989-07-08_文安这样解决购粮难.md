In recent years, many places have faced difficulties in grain procurement, but Wen'an County in Hebei Province has successfully completed its grain procurement tasks for two consecutive years, and its relations between officials and the masses are not as tense as in other places. What is the reason behind this?

It's Not Just About Prices

The invisible hand of the law of value has stirred the hearts of the farmers. If the state does not adjust grain prices, procurement will only become more difficult! This has been a common sentiment in recent years.

Upon arriving in Wen'an, during a conversation with County Party Secretary Zhang Guobin, he said, "It's not just one itch, but a hundred scratches. The difficulty in grain procurement is a complex issue with many causes, and price is just one of them." He then listed five reasons. After visiting the grain bureau and conducting investigations below, we found that what he said was true.

"The procurement price is slightly adjusted, the market price surges, and some farmers do not understand!" The grain bureau officials cited the first reason for the difficulty in procurement: the impact of the law of value.

People from Wen'an are known for their simplicity and honesty. Paying taxes and delivering grain is a belief that has never wavered among the farmers here for thousands of years. When the waves of the commodity economy pushed the market grain prices to their peak, some farmers, in the comparison of benefits, became less enthusiastic about delivering grain. The public grain for 1986 was not fully delivered until March 1987. The leaders of the county grain bureau said, "This cannot be entirely blamed on the farmers. Honest people also do calculations. Take last year's wheat, for example, the procurement price was 0.508 yuan per kilogram, and the market price was 1.30-1.40 yuan. The entire county collected 70 million kilograms, and farmers lost six or seven million yuan, equivalent to each of the 300,000 farmers in the county taking out two ten-yuan notes from their pockets." The low procurement price for grain is indeed an important reason for the difficulty in procurement, but it is not the only reason. Listen to another voice—

"Tilling the land and delivering grain is a natural duty, even if the procurement price is low, one must think of the country; but, one person's land feeds seven people, who thinks of me!" This is the second reason for the difficulty in procurement: the shortcomings of the land contract responsibility system.

In recent years, due to factors such as birth, death, and marriage, the number of people in many rural households has changed significantly, but the contracted land area has remained unchanged for many years. This has caused difficulties in grain procurement: households with reduced people but unchanged land cannot farm it all, leading to abandoned fields and no grain to deliver; households with increased people but unchanged land have more mouths to feed and less grain to deliver. In the places we visited, some households once had three people farming one person's land; some households had one person's land feeding seven people.

"We can afford to deliver the grain, but we can't afford the time!" This is the third reason for the difficulty in procurement: the old procurement system does not adapt to the new situation.

Before the land was contracted to households, grain delivery was done by production teams, with 20 procurement points in the county serving 383 villages and more than 1,700 production teams. After the land was contracted to households, more than 86,000 households in the county all had to deliver grain to the grain stations, but the number of procurement points remained the same. Farmers had to line up from early morning to late evening to deliver grain. Some farmers had no choice but to delay it again and again.

One Remedy for Each Symptom, Comprehensive Treatment

County Magistrate Li Ming said: To solve the problem of difficult grain procurement, one cannot expect to use one key to open a thousand locks, and there is no panacea for this issue. Our approach is to treat each symptom individually and comprehensively.

Treating the aftermath of land contracts: The county, township (town), and village levels work together to improve the land contract responsibility system. Daliu Town, in response to the dissatisfaction caused by reduced people but unchanged land and increased people but unchanged land, reasonably adjusted the land and reserved some flexible land for future use by households with new additions. This part of the land, before being contracted to households, is implemented with short-term contracts.

Treating the loss in grain production: The county, township, and village, starting from the actual situation of slight price adjustments and sharp increases in the prices of production materials, adopt various measures to compensate farmers, ensuring that farmers do not lose money or lose less money from grain production. Some villages provide a certain proportion of fertilizer subsidies to households, some villages bear the water and electricity fees for irrigation by households, and some villages build cement ditches to the fields of households. In the past two years, the county, township, and village have used 20 million yuan for agricultural subsidies.

Treating the obstruction in grain procurement: The county grain bureau, facing the new situation of procurement work, broke away from the old framework that has been followed for many years and implemented reforms to widen the procurement channels and extend the procurement chain, fundamentally solving the problem of smooth procurement. In the past two years, before each grain procurement season, they have done all the preparatory work, increased procurement points, and added settlement windows. They also extended the procurement chain to villages and households, and for villages that are far from procurement points or have inconvenient transportation, each grain station brought vehicles, scales, cash, and receipts to the villages and households for procurement.

Before procurement, the county government also held coordination meetings, clearly defined responsibilities, and each took their own responsibilities. The supply and marketing cooperatives prepared the linked materials, the commerce bureau managed the market, and the agricultural bank prepared sufficient funds.

Treating the fading of patriotism: The county party committee and government, in the process of solving the difficulty in grain procurement, used various forms to carry out patriotic education, strengthened the farmers' sense of the state, and made it clear that delivering grain is a duty that farmers owe to the state.

    文安这样解决购粮难
    邢宝良　王秉祺　潘晓华
    近几年，许多地方都喊购粮难，河北文安县却连续两年超额完成购粮任务，而且干群关系也不像别的地方那样紧张。这是什么缘故呢？
    并非都是价格问题
    价值规律这只无形的手拨动了农民的心。国家不调粮价，购粮只能是越来越难！这是近几年极普遍的议论。
    到了文安，与县委书记张国斌交谈时，他却说：“不是一手挠心，而是百爪抓心。购粮难是个综合症，原因很多，价格只是其中之一。”接着，张书记摆出了5条。我们到粮食局和下面调查一番后，觉得他说的是实情。
    “收购价微调，市价猛涨，部分农民想不通！”粮食局的同志摆了征粮难的第一个原因：价值规律的冲击。
    文安人以纯朴、老实著称。交粮纳税是这里的农民千百年来从未动摇过的信念。当商品经济的冲击波把市场上的粮价推到浪尖上后，一部分农民在效益的比较中对交公粮越来越不热心，1986年的公粮拖到1987年3月才勉强交上来。县粮食局的领导说：“这不能全怨农民，老实人也会算帐。拿去年的小麦来说，收购价是每公斤0.508元，市价是1.30—1.40元，全县共收购700万公斤，农民少收入六七百万元哩，等于全县30多万农民每人从腰包里边掏出两张大团结。”粮食收购价过低，确是购粮难的一个重要原因。但不是唯一的原因。请听另一种声音——
    “种地纳粮天经地义，收购价再低，也得为国家想想；可是，1口人的地养活7口人，谁替俺想想！”这就是征粮难的第二个原因：土地承包责任制不完善的积弊。
    近几年，受生死嫁娶因素的影响，农村中不少户人员增减变化很大，而承包地面积却多年不变，这就给购粮带来难处：减人不减地的户种不过来，荒了田没粮交；添人不添地的户嘴多粮少没交的份。我们走访过的地方，有的户曾是三口人的地1人种；有的户1人的地养活7口人。
    “我们交得起粮食，搭不起时间！”这就是购粮难的第三个原因：收购的旧体制不适应新形势。
    在土地承包到户之前，交售粮以生产队为单位，全县20个收粮点对383个村的1700多个生产队。土地承包到户后，全县86000多个农户都要到粮站交粮，收购网点还是那么多，农民交粮得从早排晚。一些农民只好一拖再拖。
    一药一症　综合治理
    县长李中说：解决征粮难的问题，不能企图用一把钥匙打开千把锁，在这个问题上也没有医治百病的灵丹妙药。我们的做法是一药一症，综合治理。
    医治包地后遗症：县、乡（镇）、村三级通力合作，完善土地承包责任制。大留镇针对减人不减地、添人不增地而引起的不满情绪，合理调剂土地，还留出部分机动地作为今后农户新添人口的备用地。这部分地在没分包到户之前，实行短期承包。
    医治种粮亏补症：县、乡、村从粮价微调、生资价猛涨的实际出发，采取各种补农措施，保证农民种粮不吃亏或少吃亏。有的村发给农户一定比例的化肥补贴，有的村承担农户浇地的水电费，有的村把水泥垄沟修到农户的田头。近两年，县、乡、村用于农业的补贴达2000万元。
    医治收粮梗塞症：县粮食局面对收购工作的新形势，打破多年沿袭的旧框框，实行了拓宽收购渠道、延伸收购链条的改革，从根本上解决了收购不畅的问题。近两年，每当收粮季节到来之前，他们做好各项准备工作，增设收购网点，增加决算窗口。他们还把收购的链条延伸到村、户，对离收购点较远或交通不便的村，各粮站带上车、磅、现金、收据进村入户收购。
    收购前，县政府还召开协调会，明确分工，各负其责。供销社备好挂钩物资，工商局管好市场，农行备足资金。
    医治爱国观念淡漠症：县委、县政府在解决购粮难的过程中，采用多种形式，开展爱国主义教育，增强农民的国家观念，明确了交售粮是农民对国家应尽的义务。
