The town of Xia Dian in Dacang Hui Autonomous County, Hebei Province, is a major trading hub for cattle and sheep in northern China. There are three renowned figures there, known as the "three marvels": Zuo Qingyuan's hands, Yang Jing'en's eyes, and Liu Shichuan's mouth!

In the cold winter month of La, the north wind is biting. Inside the trading warehouse, manager Zuo Qingyuan is busy, sweating profusely. There are nearly a thousand head of cattle and tens of thousands of sheep, all bleating incessantly. Old Zuo is busy pricing each cow.

In front of a young man selling a cow, Zuo Qingyuan feels the cow with his hands and says, "340 pounds." The young man disagrees, and an argument ensues.

The young man, breathing heavily, says, "You say 340 pounds, I say 360 pounds. If it's less than 360 pounds, I won't take the money. If it's 360 pounds or more, what then?"

Zuo, whose family has been in the cattle and sheep brokerage business for three generations, hears this and shouts, "If it's 360 pounds, I'll compensate you with three cows!"

The young man calls someone to slaughter the cow and remove its skin. When it's weighed, he is stunned: 340 pounds exactly, the scale is perfectly balanced.

The young man lowers his head and mutters, "I'm convinced!"

Zuo Qingyuan's hands are extraordinary. Over the past decade, he has handled 150,000 head of cattle and 180,000 sheep, and neither buyers nor sellers have any doubts.

Now, let's talk about Yang Jing'en's eyes.

This old man, Yang, is 85 years old, and his eyes are not only not failing, but they are exceptionally sharp.

For six or seven decades, as long as he counts the sheep in the market, there are never any mistakes.

Once, a customer from the border regions brought a flock of sheep to be counted. The two men guarding the pen counted twice, their eyes blurred, and they were still uncertain. They had to ask the old man, "Please help us out!"

Yang Jing'en holds a three-foot-long stick, eyes fixed on the flock of sheep, and instructs someone to drive them, "Hustle, hustle." As the flock passes, the count is clear: 600 exactly.

The border customer sighs in admiration, "My goodness, that's the exact number!"

Four customers from Inner Mongolia are skeptical: "Can you count our two flocks?"

Yang, stroking his few goat-like whiskers, says, "Let's try!"

The four men swing their whips, merging the two flocks into one, and they rush into the pen like a swarm of bees.

Yang Jing'en tilts his head, squints his eyes, and his stick moves like a chicken pecking at grain.

"837!" "No, it's 838!" the four customers say in unison.

Yang Jing'en's eyes widen suddenly: "Where are you from?"

"We're from the sheep route!"

"Hurry up and find it. If no sheep have gone astray, I'll gouge out my eyes and step on them!"

The four are not entirely convinced but still go back to look. After a while, they bring back a small flower lamb: "Found it! You're amazing!"

Lastly, let's talk about Liu Shichuan's mouth.

Buying and selling cattle and sheep requires a broker to mediate; otherwise, arguments between the two parties make it difficult to reach an agreement.

A villager from Beiku, He Peirong, is selling four dairy cows, estimating the weight and pricing them at 1,200 yuan each. The buyer wants 1,400 yuan, and neither side is willing to budge. It seems the deal is about to fall through. At this moment, 74-year-old Liu Shichuan walks over. He pinches the seller's sleeve and whispers something, then does the same to the buyer. Both sides nod, and finally, the deal is struck at 1,230 yuan per cow.

People ask, "What did you say to them?"

He smiles mysteriously, "A key opens a lock, divine secrets cannot be revealed!"

In the past decade, the number of cattle and sheep deals he has mediated is likely around 80,000! Those who don't know him would never believe that this old man's silver tongue can make money!

    夏垫“三绝”
    韩冬　王崇玉
    河北省大厂回族自治县夏垫镇是北方重要的牛羊贸易集市。那里有3位赫赫有名的人物，号称“三绝”：左庆铨的手，杨景恩的眼，刘士传的嘴！
    腊月天，北风刺骨。贸易货栈里，经理左庆铨却忙得满头大汗。八九百头牛，近万只羊，“哞哞”、“咩咩”叫个不停。老左正在挨个给牛定价。
    在一位卖牛小伙子的面前，左庆铨用手一掐，说：“340斤。”那人不干，两人争执起来。
    年轻人喘着粗气说：“您说340斤，我说360斤，要是360斤以下，我不要钱，要是够360斤，咋办？”
    祖上3代都干牛羊经纪行当的老左一听这话，大声说：“够360斤，我赔你仨牛！”
    那小伙子找来人就地宰牛剥皮。一上秤，他愣住了：340斤整，秤杆平平的。
    小伙子低头喃喃地说：“我服了您了！”
    左庆铨的手，不得了，10年来，已摸过15万头牛、18万只羊了，买卖双方没有不信服的。
    再说杨景恩的眼。
    这位杨老爷子85岁了，眼不仅不花，而且亮得出奇。
    六七十年了，牛羊市上只要他数羊，绝对没错儿。
    一次口外客人赶了一群羊来入圈，守圈的爷儿俩数，两遍了，眼睛发花，心里还没底儿，只好求老爷子：“您费费神！”
    杨景恩手持3尺来长的小棍，眼盯着羊群，让人赶，“唿喽唿喽”，羊群一过，数儿出来了：600整。
    口外客人叹服：“我的爹，正是这数！”
    有4位内蒙古客人不服气：“能数数俺们这两群吗？”
    杨老汉捋着几根山羊胡道：“试试吧！”
    那4位甩开鞭子，两群羊合成一群，一窝蜂似的拥进羊圈。
    杨景恩歪着头，眯缝着眼，手中的小棍如鸡啄米。
    “837！”“不对，是838！”4位客人异口同声，
    杨景恩眼睛猛地睁大：“你们从哪儿来？”“羊道哇！”
    “赶快找，要是没有羊走岔，我剜出眼珠当泡儿踩！”
    那4位不大相信，可还是回头去找。过一会儿，抱一只小花羊羔回来了：“找到了！真神！”
    最后说刘士传的嘴。
    买卖牛羊，得靠经纪人说合，不然，争争吵吵双方很难成交。
    北坞村何培荣卖4头奶牛，估了分量，作价1200元一头。卖主要1400元，双方都不退让，眼看要告吹。这时，74岁的刘士传老汉走过来。他在卖主袖筒里捏捏，耳边说两句，又在买主耳边说说，袖筒里捏捏，双方点点头，最后以1230元一头成交。
    人们问：“你跟他俩说的啥呀？” 
    他诡秘地笑笑：“一把钥匙开一把锁，天机不可泄漏！”
    近10年，经他说合成交的牛羊恐怕没有10万也有8万！不了解他的人，怎会相信这位老人一张妙语生财的嘴呢！
