The practice of using public funds for extravagant feasts is a form of corruption that has long been detested by the masses, as it represents a corrupt behavior.

Eating and drinking are basic human needs, but some people have taken advantage of this, blurring the line between public and private interests, leading to a widespread culture of extravagant feasts.

Whenever public funds are used for such feasts, there are always seemingly legitimate excuses. These individuals enjoy feasting without spending a penny of their own, indulging in alcohol and food, living a life of leisure. To satisfy their gluttony, some people become bold and reckless, engaging in activities that violate party discipline, legal regulations, and administrative rules. Consequently, there are cases of embezzlement, misappropriation of public funds, or, as seen in Chengbei Township, exploiting national policies to overcharge fees. This not only affects the normal production and investment of the state and collective entities but also adds an extra financial burden to the people.

The culture of extravagant feasts has caused some cadres to abandon the fine traditions of hard work and frugality, developing a habit of seeking pleasure. Some of them spend their days immersed in banquets, clinking glasses, neglecting their duties, and becoming true "public fund feasting officials."

Even more seriously, the quality of feasts and receptions has become the standard by which some cadres judge whether to handle matters. Things that should not be done are done if the reception is good; things that should be done are delayed if the reception is poor.

Clearly, the wind of extravagant feasts tarnishes the image of party and government organs, damages the relationship between the party and the people, and between cadres and the masses, affecting the party and government's authority among the people. It is a major issue that must be resolutely addressed in our efforts to promote clean governance.

To curb the wind of extravagant feasts, it is crucial for leaders at all levels to take the lead by not indulging in gluttony. Additionally, there must be strengthened ideological education for all cadres to cultivate a spirit of integrity and hard work, enabling them to control their appetites. Those who habitually use public funds for extravagant feasts and refuse to mend their ways must be severely dealt with. Each region and unit should formulate and enforce regulations to curb the wind of extravagant feasts, such as implementing a separate dining system for guests, setting a standard of four dishes and one soup for receptions, and requiring those who exceed the standard to pay out of their own pockets.

### 用公款大吃大喝是一种腐败现象

    用公款大吃大喝是一种腐败现象
    吃喝风早已为广大群众所痛恨，因为它是一种腐败现象。
    吃喝，本是人们生活需要，可是一些人借此公私不分起来，大吃大喝成风。
    凡动用公款大吃大喝的，每每总有冠冕堂皇的借口，自己不费一分一厘，就能酒足饭饱，优哉游哉。为了能大吃大喝，一些人胆大妄为，干起违背党纪、法纪、政纪的事来。于是贪污者有之，挪用公款者有之，或者如城北乡那样，利用国家政策，加码征收钱款者有之。这既影响了国家、集体正常的生产投资，又增加了群众额外的经济负担。
    吃喝风使一些干部丢掉了艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的优良传统，养成了贪图享受的恶习。他们中的一些人成天泡在酒宴之中，觥筹交错，把本职工作抛到了脑后，成了名副其实的“公款吃喝干部”。
    更为严重的是，吃喝招待的好坏，成了时下一些干部心目中的天平办事的标准。本来不该办的事，只要招待得好点，也给办了；招待得不好，能办的事也会卡壳。
    很显然，大吃大喝之风，败坏了党政机关的形象，损害了党群关系、干群关系，影响了党和政府在群众中的威信，是我们搞廉政建设中必须下决心解决的一个大问题。
    要刹住吃喝风，首先各级领导干部要起带头作用，不贪吃。同时要加强对广大干部的思想教育，培养廉洁奉公、艰苦创业的精神，使干部能管住自己的嘴。对于那些用公款大吃大喝成性而又屡教不改的干部，必须严肃处理。各地区、各单位还要制定和执行刹住吃喝风的规章制度，比如说，来客实行分餐制，招待按四菜一汤标准，超标准时，谁请客谁掏钱等。
