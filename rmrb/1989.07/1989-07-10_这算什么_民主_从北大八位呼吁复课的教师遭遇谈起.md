The incident occurred in late May and early June this year. Given that since mid-April, students at the university had been on strike, participating in marches and hunger strikes, which severely affected their studies and made it impossible for teaching to proceed normally, and campus order could not be maintained, on May 29, eight professors and associate professors at Peking University jointly wrote a letter to the school leadership, issuing a call to "Students, let's return to class!" The letter pointed out: "More than a month of facts has clearly shown that using strikes, marches, and hunger strikes as means can fully express the fervor of the masses and the urgency of their hopes, but cannot actually solve problems, and is likely to create a stalemate, dragging on indefinitely, to no avail." The letter sincerely advised students who had not yet returned to class, "When dealing with serious political issues, one must be extremely cautious, and in the current extremely complex situation, one must be particularly calm and rational." "Do not oppose patriotism with diligent study for the motherland; cherish your youth."

The appeal by the eight teachers was broadcast on television and published in newspapers on May 31, receiving support from many faculty and students, who believed it expressed the common voice of the broad community of teachers and students. However, at the same time, it also provoked dissatisfaction from some people, who quickly posted opposing, mocking, and abusive big-character posters, large banners, and small-character posters in the Sanjiaodi area of Peking University. For a time, the eight professors and associate professors became the center of campus gossip, and a not-small-not-large controversy erupted over the evaluation of the "Appeal."

It should be said that the eight professors and associate professors had sincere and benevolent intentions; they did not want the turmoil and unrest to cause great, irreparable damage to the broad student body. The tone of the eight professors and associate professors was also friendly and calm; they had not a hint of a lecturing attitude but rather hoped that the students would have a long-term perspective, return to class, and work towards a proper resolution of the problems. Anyone with a bit of conscience would agree with their views.

However, these eight professors and associate professors were subjected to groundless insults and attacks by a small group of people. Large banners labeled them as the "Eight Great Teacher Bandits" and "XXX accomplices." Big-character posters issued "strong protests" against them and initiated a "signature campaign," calling for a permanent boycott of their classes. Some people even wrote on big-character posters: "Please inform us of their addresses, and we will express our anger in various ways." One associate professor, who had repeatedly advised students not to participate in illegal marches, was publicly slandered by a big-character poster, claiming that this teacher was a member of the marching crowd and was now jumping out to criticize with a small group of people, clearly an opportunistic act. The big-character poster arrogantly suggested that the school should no longer employ this teacher and revoke his associate professorship. Another big-character poster even maliciously wrote: "Notice to the eight 'teacher bandits' to go to the Xth floor, Xth room (toilet) to receive the Xth government's Xth yuan reward."

Still not satisfied, on the afternoon of June 1, they posted another big-character poster titled "Portrait of a 'Model Teacher' at Peking University." This big-character poster did not refute any of the points in the appeal nor did it propose any constructive opinions; instead, it used crude and vulgar language throughout to slander and personally attack the eight teachers. For example, one teacher who smokes was labeled a "smoker" and "ghost"; another teacher who suffers from severe kidney disease but continues to work was accused of having "lost kidney function" and relying on external circulation for dialysis every week, and was told, "Our country needs a blood transfusion more," and that he should join the Disabled Persons Federation and should not come out to advocate for returning to class. The big-character poster slandered one person as "only capable of fighting with his wife at home" and another as having "puffy eyes all the time," and another as not having written a single article in years, and another as only fit to join the "Confused Association." Even vulgar terms like "prostitute," "three-legged," and "mental patient" appeared.

An elderly retired teacher, upon seeing this big-character poster, stood there trembling with anger. A female student, seeing the teachers being humiliated in a socialist university, the highest institution of learning, burst into tears. A female teacher from the Law School comforted her back to the dormitory. A passing teacher, upon seeing the term "teacher bandits," expressed a slight objection and was immediately surrounded and driven away by some people; another teacher, in front of students, pointed out that hearing a different voice and then being threatened and insulted was "too undemocratic" and "too immoral," resulting in a group of people surrounding him to argue. This teacher argued with them on principle, at which point some people argued stubbornly, some pushed and shoved, some took a fighting stance, and some demanded to "check this person's credentials." This teacher calmly took out his "Peking University Work Certificate" from his pocket. Feeling guilty and defeated, someone pointed at the teacher's nose and shouted: "Then you are the 'ninth teacher bandit'." This teacher was surrounded and attacked for more than 20 minutes.

Even stranger, the big-character posters at Peking University attacking the teachers appeared on June 2 in the form of a "Special Report from Our Reporter in Beijing" on the front page of the eighth page of the Hong Kong "Ming Pao." The "Special Report" was headlined "Internal Strife Among Some Teachers and Students at Peking University," using a very affirmative tone to turn the rumors in the big-character posters into facts, and listed the names of the eight teachers (the most famous Professor Feng's name was deliberately altered by removing one character), denouncing them as a small group of "opportunists," claiming that these people had "seriously damaged the image of Peking University and Peking University teachers in the hearts of the people of the nation," causing Peking University to suffer "great disgrace." The "Special Report" also, under the guise of quoting big-character posters, repeatedly called on students to "permanently boycott" the courses taught by the eight teachers.

After reading these big banners, big-character posters, especially the so-called "Portrait" on June 1 and the "Special Report" in "Ming Pao" on June 2, and understanding the scene of the so-called "ninth teacher bandit" being surrounded and attacked, one can see clearly what kind of "democracy" a small group of people were practicing in the turmoil and unrest. One can see clearly who maintained the dignity of the school and who hoped for unrest, bringing disgrace to the school.

Some people shout "patriotism," "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights" as if these are their exclusive rights, but when it comes to practice, they change their tune, revealing how hypocritical their slogans are! Is an indefinite strike and marching on the streets, overthrowing this person today and that person tomorrow, considered "patriotism"? Is it "democracy" to allow only officials to set fires while prohibiting the people from lighting lamps, and not allowing any different opinions on campus? Is it "freedom" and respect for "human rights" to slander and personally attack teachers at will, even to the point of wanting to fight? Their actions themselves expose their lies.

Lu Xun said: "Insults and threats are not fighting." "Trickery has its methods and is also effective, but it is limited, so those who have achieved great things with this method have never existed in history." Some university students (and a few teachers) use such filthy language and engage in such despicable acts in serious political struggles, acting both tyrannically and with dirty souls. Isn't this bringing shame to a socialist university and losing national dignity and personal integrity? If people of such quality come to power in our country in the future, what will be left of democracy, the rule of law, morality, and civilization?

The experience of the eight Peking University teachers who called for a return to classes reflects many problems and is worth deep thought. Every student and teacher with a conscience will draw some lessons from it.

    这算什么“民主”
    ——从北大八位呼吁复课的教师遭遇谈起
    北京大学　施义武
    事情发生在今年5月底和6月初。鉴于从4月中旬以来，学校学生因罢课、游行和绝食等活动，严重影响了学业，教学基本不能正常进行，校园秩序亦无法维持，5月29日，北京大学八位教授、副教授，联名写信给校领导，发出“同学们，快复课吧！”的呼吁。信中指出：“一个多月的事实，清楚地表明，采用罢课、游行和绝食等手段，能充分表现群情激愤和希望的殷切，不能切切实实地解决问题，并且容易形成僵持不下的局面，旷日持久，于事无补。”信中诚恳地劝告尚未复课的同学们，“对待严肃的政治问题，必须慎之又慎，在当前异常复杂的形势下，尤其需要高度的冷静和理智”。“不要把爱国与为祖国而刻苦学习对立起来，请珍惜自己的青春年华”。
    八位教师的呼吁，5月31日电视播出并公诸报端以后，得到了许多教员和同学的支持，认为表达了广大师生员工共同的心声。但与此同时，也激起了一些人的不满，他们很快在北大三角地贴出一些反对、嘲骂的大字报、大标语、小字报。一时间，八位教授、副教授成了北大街谈巷议的中心人物，围绕着“呼吁书”的评价掀起了一场不大不小的风波。
    应该说，八位教授、副教授的心是真诚的、善意的，他们不希望学潮和动乱给广大学生本人造成巨大的、难以弥补的损失。八位教授、副教授的口气也是亲切的、平和的，他们没有一丝教训人的态度，而是企盼学生目光长远，一面复课，一面谋求问题的妥善解决。任何一位多少有些良知的人都会赞同他们的意见。
    可是，这八位教授、副教授却遭到一小撮人无端的污辱和攻击。大标语把他们称作“八大师贼”、“××帮凶”。大字报向他们提出“强烈抗议”，并发起什么“签名”，号召“永远罢上他们的课”。有的人还在大字报上写着：“请知情人写下他们的住址，我们将用各种不同的方式表达我们的愤怒。”其中有位副教授，曾多次劝告同学们不要参加非法游行，某大字报竟公开造谣，说这位教师就是游行队伍中的一员，现在又跳出来与一小撮人说三道四，分明是投机行为，大字报还蛮横地建议校方不再聘任这位教师的教学工作，并取消他的副教授资格。有张大字报还恶作剧式地写出：通知八位“师贼”到××楼××号（厕所）去领××伪政府的×××元奖金。
    这样，他们还觉得不够味儿，于6月1日下午又贴出一张题为《北大“模范教师”素描》的大字报。这张大字报没有反驳呼吁书中的任何论点，没有提出任何一点建设性的意见，而是通篇以粗野和下流的语言，对八位教师逐个进行诬陷和人身攻击。例如有位教师会吸烟，这竟然成了一条罪状，被斥为“烟棍”、“幽灵”；有位教师身患严重肾病，但坚持工作，大字报竟说“你肾功能丧失，靠体外循环，每周换血”，“我们国家更需要换血”，你最好去加入残疾人协会，根本不应当站出来呼吁复课；大字报诬蔑这个人“在家只会和老婆打离婚”，诬蔑那个人“眼泡老是鼓鼓的”，诬蔑这个人“几年内一篇文章没写过”，诬蔑那个人“只配进入迷糊协会”，甚至连“婊子”“三条腿”“神经病患者”这样不堪入目的字样也出现了。
    有位离了休的老教师，见到这张大字报，站在那里，气得浑身发抖。有位女同学，看到教师们在社会主义大学、堂堂的最高学府受到这般凌辱，不禁痛哭失声，法律系一位女教师将她劝回宿舍。有位过路的教师，见到“师贼”的提法，稍稍表示异议，当即遭到一些人的围攻，被轰走；有位教师，当着同学的面指出，听到一点不同的声音就这样恐吓、谩骂，“太不民主”、“太不道德”，结果一伙人围上来跟他争吵。这位老师据理和他们辩论，这时，有的人胡搅蛮缠，有的人推推搡搡，有的人摆出要打人的架势，有的人提出要“盘查此人的证件”，这位老师坦然地从兜里掏出“北京大学工作证”，有人自觉理屈辞穷，便气急败坏地指着这位教员的鼻子骂道：那你就是出来的“第九个师贼”。这位老师足足被围攻了20多分钟。
    更令人奇怪的是，北大这些攻击教员的大字报，6月2日就以“本报记者北京专电”的形式出现在香港《明报》第八版头条位置上。“专电”以《北大部分师生内哄》为大标题，用十分肯定的语气，把大字报中的谣言说成是事实，并且一一开列8位教师的姓名（其中最知名的冯教授的名字还被故意拉掉一个字），斥责他们是一小撮“投机分子”，声称这些人“严重损害了北大和北大教师在全国人民心中的形象”，令北大蒙受“莫大的耻辱”。“专电”还假借转述大字报的方式，反复地向同学们发出号召，要求同学“永远抵制”8位教师所开的课程。
    人们读过这些大标语、大字报，尤其是6月1日所谓的《素描》、6月2日《明报》的“专电”，了解了所谓“第九个师贼”遭围攻的情景，不难看到，学潮和动乱中一小撮人搞的是什么样的“民主”。不难看出，到底是谁维护了学校的尊严，谁在希望动乱，给学校带来了耻辱。
    有些人口口声声喊“爱国”、“民主”、“自由”、“人权”，仿佛这些是他们的专利，可是一到实际中就变了样，足见他们的口号是多么虚伪！难道无限期罢课、上街，今天打倒这个，明天打倒那个，能算作“爱国”吗？难道“只许州官放火，不许百姓点灯”，在校园内不许说半点不同意见，能说是“民主”吗？难道随意对教师进行造谣中伤，人身攻击，甚至想大打出手，就是所谓的“自由”和尊重“人权”吗？这些人言行本身就拆穿了他们的谎话。
    鲁迅说：“辱骂和恐吓决不是战斗”。“捣鬼有术，也有效，然而有限，所以以此成大事者，古来无有。”有些大学生（还有个别教师），在严肃的政治斗争中，使用如此龌龊的语言，干出如此下作的勾当，既专横跋扈，又灵魂肮脏，难道不是给社会主义的大学丢脸，又丧失了国格、人格吗？我们的国家将来若是这样素质的人掌了权，那还有什么民主、法制、道德和文明可言呢？
    北京大学8位呼吁复课教师的遭遇，反映了许多问题，很值得人们深思。每个有良知的学生和教师，都会从中悟出一些道理。
