	Private Motorcycles Rolling, Using State-Owned Gasoline

	Currently, in the Zhalainuoer Mining District of Hulunbuir League, Inner Mongolia, there are over 5,000 motorcycles of various types. These motorcycles consume approximately 300,000 kilograms of gasoline annually, valued at 3 million yuan. However, only two households purchased gasoline last year. Recently, the mining district faced a gasoline shortage, causing some commuter vehicles to break down. Despite this, these motorcycles continued to operate smoothly. The gasoline used by these motorcycles in the streets and alleys is mostly obtained from state-owned sources.

	According to regulations, the traffic department issues driving licenses and gasoline supply certificates to private motorcycle owners. However, after obtaining these certificates, motorcycle owners find it difficult to purchase gasoline. A responsible official from the traffic department stated, "We are only responsible for issuing gasoline supply certificates, but the gasoline supply service for motorcycles has not been established."

    私人铁骑车轮滚滚  原来使用公家汽油
    目前内蒙古呼伦贝尔盟扎来诺尔矿区有各种摩托车五千多辆，一年用汽油约三十万公斤，价值三十万元，而去年买过汽油的只有两户。前段时间，这个矿区汽油吃紧，连一些通勤车都趴窝了，但这些铁骑仍是车轮滚滚。在大街小巷奔跑的铁骑用的汽油大都是揩公家的。按规定，交通部门给私人摩托车主发了行驶牌照后，还给办理汽油供应证。但是，车主拿了供油证却无处买油。交通部门负责同志说，我们只管发放供油证，但摩托车加油业务却没能跟上。
