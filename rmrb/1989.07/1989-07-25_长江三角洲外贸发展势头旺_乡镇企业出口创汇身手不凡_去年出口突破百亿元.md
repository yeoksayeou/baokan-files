In the vast fields of the Yangtze River Delta, a 300,000-strong army of township enterprises has emerged on the stage of export-oriented economy with a new posture, achieving outstanding results. Last year, their export product sales exceeded 10 billion yuan, and this year, foreign trade production continues to maintain a strong development momentum.

Over the past year, township enterprises in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and the suburbs of Shanghai have all seen unprecedentedly favorable situations in foreign trade exports. Among them, the foreign trade procurement amounts in Zhejiang and Shanghai suburbs increased by 83% and 40% respectively compared to the previous year, and in the first quarter of this year, they increased by 70% and 31% respectively compared to the same period last year. The most developed export-oriented economy in Suzhou City saw a 1.26-fold increase in foreign trade procurement amount compared to the previous year. In the Yangtze River Delta, almost every county and township has a number of export-oriented enterprises and products standing out. So far, the number of export-oriented enterprises in this region has developed to more than 7,000, with foreign trade products developed into more than 200 categories and thousands of varieties. Among them, a large number of traditional products, such as Yixing's ceramics, Changshu's lace, Wuxian's embroidery, Wuxi and Yuhang's silk, Chuansha's clothing, Qingpu's lace, Yinxian's grass weaving products, etc., are still popular in the international market. New products developed in recent years, such as Pinghu's fasteners, Xiaoshan's universal joints, Chongming's household appliances, Wuxi's electronic components, and Nanhui's wooden screws, have also emerged in the international market.

The thriving development of township enterprises' export-oriented economy has shown a broad prospect for the development of foreign trade in the Yangtze River Delta. In the total export volume of the entire region, the proportion of township enterprises is becoming increasingly larger. Last year, the foreign trade delivery amount of township enterprises in Jiangsu Province accounted for more than 50% of the province's total foreign trade procurement. One-quarter of the foreign trade products exported through Zhejiang Province's ports were provided by township enterprises. In recent years, one-third of the increased export products in Shanghai City were produced by township enterprises, with light textile products accounting for more than 60% of the city's export volume.

    长江三角洲外贸发展势头旺
    乡镇企业出口创汇身手不凡
    去年出口突破百亿元
    据新华社北京7月25日电（记者袁养和、孙洪祥、许群）在长江三角洲辽阔田野上，一支300多万人的乡镇企业大军，以新的姿态崛起于外向型经济舞台，取得了优异成绩。去年，其出口产品交售额一举突破100亿元，今年以来外贸生产仍保持旺盛发展势头。
    在过去一年中，江苏、浙江、上海郊区乡镇企业外贸出口都出现了前所未有的喜人局面。其中浙江和上海郊县外贸收购额分别比上年增长83％和40％，今年一季度又比去年同期增长70％和31％。外向型经济最发达的苏州市，去年外贸收购额比上年增长1.26倍。在长江三角洲，几乎每个县、乡都有一批外向型企业和产品脱颖而出。到目前为止，这个地区外向型企业已发展到7000余家，外贸产品发展到200多个大类、数千个品种。其中一大批传统产品，像宜兴的陶瓷，常熟的花边，吴县的刺绣，吴江和余杭的丝绸，川沙的服装，青浦的抽纱，鄞县的草编织品等，在国际市场上畅销不衰。近年来开发的新产品，如平湖的紧固件，肖山的万向节，崇明的家用电器，无锡的电子元器件，南汇的木螺钉等，也在国际市场上崭露头角。
    乡镇企业外向型经济的蓬勃兴起，为长江三角洲发展对外贸易展示了广阔前景。在全地区的外贸出口额中乡镇企业的比重越来越大。去年，江苏省乡镇企业外贸交货额占到全省外贸收购总额的50％以上，浙江省通过本省口岸出口的外贸产品，有1／4是乡镇企业提供的。近年来上海市增加的出口产品中，乡镇企业生产的占1／3，其中轻纺产品已占全市出口量的60％以上。
