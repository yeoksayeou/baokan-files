In recent years, China's construction workforce has grown to nearly 24 million. To strengthen the management of construction company qualifications, ensure that companies legally undertake and operate construction projects, and maintain the economic order of the construction market, the Ministry of Construction has issued the "Regulations on the Management of Construction Company Qualifications," which will come into effect on August 1.

The "Regulations" stipulate that all construction companies engaged in various activities such as building construction, civil engineering, equipment installation, and pipeline laying are subject to these regulations. The Ministry of Construction will oversee the qualifications of construction companies nationwide; relevant departments under the State Council will manage the qualifications of their respective construction companies, and will accept guidance from the overseeing department in terms of business operations; provincial, autonomous region, and municipal construction administrative departments will oversee the qualifications of construction companies within their jurisdictions.

The "Regulations" also specify that all state-owned construction companies, collectively-owned construction companies, Sino-foreign joint ventures, Sino-foreign cooperative ventures, and foreign-funded enterprises engaged in construction activities within the territory of China, joint-venture construction companies, and other construction companies that need to undergo qualification review should all undergo qualification review in accordance with these regulations.
