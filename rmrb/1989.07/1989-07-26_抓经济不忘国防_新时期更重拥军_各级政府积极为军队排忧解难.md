	In the new situation of reform and opening up, local governments at all levels have been focusing on the economy while not forgetting national defense. They have been emphasizing support for the military and actively addressing the difficulties faced by the People's Liberation Army, ensuring the smooth progress of the military's revolutionization, modernization, and regularization.

	In recent years, the State Council and various ministries under the State Council have issued more than 10 legislative documents to address the difficulties faced by the military. At the same time, local governments at various levels have formulated policies and regulations based on their actual situations to ensure the construction of the military. Effective measures have also been taken to implement these policies.

	The care and support provided by the state and local governments for military construction have resolved many practical difficulties and problems in the military's work. According to incomplete statistics from the General Logistics Department, in 1986 and 1987, the military was burdened with various types of levies totaling over 70 million yuan, making the already insufficient military funds even tighter. After the General Office of the State Council issued the "Notice on Resolutely Stopping Arbitrary Levies on the Military," the practice of arbitrarily levying on the military was curbed, reducing the military's burden and strengthening military-civilian relations. Fertilizer is a scarce resource for agriculture, and military farms have also faced difficulties in purchasing fertilizer in recent years. To address this, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Commerce, and the General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army jointly issued the "Notice on Further Improving the Supply of Fertilizer to the Military" in April this year. This ensures that the military in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions (excluding Hainan Province) can receive nearly 300,000 tons of planned and subsidized fertilizer annually, creating important conditions for military farms to achieve bumper harvests. Hebei Province, where military farms are concentrated, annually supplies 85,900 tons of subsidized fertilizer to the military. For a period, some regions faced difficulties in purchasing food and daily necessities for the stationed troops. After the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the General Logistics Department jointly issued a notice, in regions where food is supplied by coupons, commercial, fishery departments, and supply and marketing cooperatives issue coupons to the military according to their standards. Food items that are supplied to urban residents at preferential prices are also supplied to the military at preferential prices. In regions where daily necessities are supplied by coupons, commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives supply the military with a slightly higher quota than that for local urban residents and give priority to ensuring their supply. The issue of transferring and resettling the jobs of officers' spouses has been a long-standing problem. After the State Council and the Central Military Commission approved the report from the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Labor, and other departments in April this year, tens of thousands of officers' spouses are being resettled and transferred, and some have ended the situation of long-term separation from their spouses. The care and support from the Party and the state have inspired and encouraged the broad masses of officers to dedicate themselves to the cause of national defense.

    抓经济不忘国防　新时期更重拥军
    各级政府积极为军队排忧解难
    据新华社北京7月26日电  （记者郭殿成）在改革开放的新形势下，各级人民政府抓经济不忘国防，致富更加拥军，积极为人民子弟兵排忧解难，保障了我军革命化、现代化、正规化建设顺利进行。
    国务院及国家各部委近年来下达了10多份为军队排忧解难的立法性文件，与此同时，地方各级政府也从实际出发，制定了一些保证部队建设的政策规定，并采取有效措施，积极落实。
    国家和各级人民政府对军队建设的关怀、支持，解决了部队工作中存在的许多实际困难和问题。据总后不完全统计，在1986和1987两年里，全军承担了各种名目的摊派款达7000多万元，使本来就不足的军费更加紧缺。国务院办公厅《关于坚决制止向军队乱摊派的通知》下达后，任意向部队摊派的现象得到克服，不仅减轻了军队负担，而且密切了军政军民关系。化肥是农业紧缺物资，军队农场这几年也出现了买肥难。为此，国家计委、商业部、解放军总后勤部于今年4月下发了《关于进一步做好军队化肥供应的通知》，使部队在除海南省以外的29个省、市、自治区，每年可以得到近30万吨计划内平价化肥供应，为军队农场夺取丰收创造了重要条件。军队农场较集中的黑龙江省，每年平价供应部队化肥8.59万吨。一段时间，有些地区的驻军买副食难、买日用生活必需品难。商业部、财政部、农业部、总后勤部联合下达通知后，在凭票供应副食品的地区，商业、水产部门和供销社按部队的标准发给票证，各地对城镇居民实行优惠供应的副食品，也优惠供应部队。凡凭票供应生活必需品的地区，商业部门和供销社都按略高于当地城镇居民的供应定量供应部队，并优先予以保障。军官配偶的工作调动和易地安置是“老大难”问题。国务院、中央军委今年4月批转了人事部、劳动部等部门的请示报告之后，成千上万军官配偶的安置、调动正在进行之中，有的已结束了夫妻长期分居的局面。党和国家的关怀，鼓舞和激励了广大军官为国防事业献身的精神。
