A long history, deep culture, and exquisite art—these three elements all form under specific natural and human conditions. This is the characteristic of Suzhou gardens. Visiting Suzhou gardens, appreciating them, and feeling them should be like slowly sipping a cup of Bi Luo Chun tea, savoring the flavor. It should not be like holding a bottle, tilting your head back, and drinking "Coke." This requires a prerequisite: the visitor must have a certain level of understanding and appreciation. This, of course, requires some rational knowledge, but more importantly, it requires some sensory cultivation. Subjectively, one must first have an artistic sentiment and a love for beauty to feel the artistic atmosphere and appreciate the beautiful scenery objectively. In terms of artistic understanding and appreciation, sensory cultivation seems to be more important than rational knowledge.

Professor Chen Congzhou said: Kunqu opera, yellow wine, and gardens represent traditional Jiangnan culture. In my experience, it should be: "Kunqu opera, yellow wine, green tea, and gardens are enough to represent traditional Jiangnan culture." Specifically for Suzhou gardens, one might add the sound of the pipa from the storytelling performances. In the misty rain, walking on the long stone path of the alley, through the moss-covered high walls, from the occasional green branches of old trees sticking out, comes the sound of a pipa... It is like in the fine rain of the small streets of Kyoto, Japan, from the second-floor paper windows of the low wooden houses, comes the low sound of a shamisen... Both give a purely Eastern artistic feeling steeped in a long history and culture. To feel this, while it may require the biological and genetic inheritance, it more importantly requires the influence of the environment, as well as the cultural education from family, school, and society.

The characteristics of Suzhou gardens can be summarized into three points: First, their history is long and continuous, enduring through the ages. Not to mention the Wuyue King's Guanshuang Palace in the Spring and Autumn period, the Metuo Garden in the Eastern Jin Dynasty, the Jin Valley Garden of the Prince of Guangling in the Five Dynasties, and the Canglang Pavilion of Su Shi in the Song Dynasty, even the Lion Grove, Humble Administrator's Garden from the Ming and Qing dynasties, and the modern Couple's Garden, Garden of the Curves, and Garden of Joy from recent times, all have clear histories. The passage of time and the vicissitudes of life are enough to make visitors lament the past and present, and reflect on life. If one understands more specifically, one can imagine the time, place, people, and events, their appearance and charm... The visitor will then have the feeling of seeing the present as the past, and will blend themselves into the historical and cultural river.

Second, their art is superb and unique. Gardens are a comprehensive art of horticulture, architecture, and painting. The formation of their style, in addition to the artistic creativity of the creators and the influence of traditional culture, is also closely related to natural geography. The Tang Dynasty poet Du Xunhe wrote: "When you come to Suzhou, you see that all the houses are by the river. There are few idle palaces, and many small bridges over waterways..." He also wrote: "Gardens often have citrus trees, and where there is no water, there are no lotuses. The night market by the bridge is lit, and the spring breeze blows outside the market..." This vividly describes the characteristics of Suzhou. Suzhou has mountains and water, a mild climate, four distinct seasons, and fertile land, providing very favorable material conditions for building gardens. Water is easy to bring in to create ponds, mountains are easy to take stones from, and there are famous Taihu stones. The land and climate are suitable for growing flowers and trees, and the four seasons are easy for viewing scenery and planting flowers. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter all have different scenes to see and flowers to appreciate. The concentration of human culture, with garden masters in every generation, from Zhu Min, who managed the Flower and Stone Tributary in the Song Dynasty, to Ni Zan in the Yuan Dynasty, Wen Zhengming in the Ming Dynasty, and Zhang Nanyuan and Ge Yuliang in the early Qing Dynasty, have all contributed to a complete set of Suzhou garden art styles that represent deep Jiangnan culture, including stacking stones, bringing in water, building pavilions, placing terraces, planting flowers, and cultivating trees.

Third, Suzhou gardens, classified into the three types of imperial, temple, and residential gardens in Chinese classical gardens, are mostly private residential gardens and are mostly connected to residences.

In today's era of reform and opening up, the number of visitors to Suzhou gardens has greatly increased, with almost no distinction between peak and off-peak seasons. Every day, tourists from all over the world flock to Suzhou, and tourists from all over the country flock to Suzhou, while local tourists make up a minority. A small area like the Thousand-Person Stone in Tiger Hill now has three to four million tourists at peak times. Even if they pass through in a single file, it is still a surging crowd. How can one feel the historical and cultural atmosphere of Suzhou gardens and appreciate their artistic realm in such a situation?

The Suzhou Garden Administration has set up the "Suzhou Classical Garden Art Exhibition Hall" at Beisi Pagoda and is actively preparing to open the "Suzhou Garden Art Museum" on the west side of the Humble Administrator's Garden. This will allow the many domestic and international tourists who come from thousands of miles away to admire the name of Suzhou classical gardens, after touring various famous gardens and gaining a wealth of direct experiences, to obtain systematic knowledge about the history, culture, and art of Suzhou gardens in the garden museum, truly feeling its cultural depth and artistic beauty.

The construction of the Suzhou Garden Museum is extremely important for promoting the historical and cultural heritage of the Chinese nation, developing Jiangnan garden art, and enriching the sightseeing content for a wide range of domestic and international tourists.

    历史·文化·园林
    ——谈苏州筹建园林艺术博物馆
    邓云乡
    悠久的历史、深厚的文化、优美的艺术，三者又都在特定的自然和人文条件下形成，这是苏州园林的特征。游览苏州园林，欣赏它，感受它，应像慢慢呷一口碧罗春一样，品品滋味。而不同于拿着瓶子，仰着头，伸长脖子喝“可乐”。这要有一个先决条件，就是游览者要有一定的理解、感受水平。这固然要有一些理性的知识，更要有一些感性的修养。主观上先要有艺术的情思、爱美的心态，才能感受到客观上艺术的气氛，欣赏到客观上美的意境。在艺术领会与鉴赏上，感性的修养，比之于理性的知识似乎更重要一些。
    陈从周教授说：昆曲、黄酒、园林，代表传统的江南文化。这话就我的感受说，应该是：“昆曲、黄酒、绿茶、园林，足以代表传统的江南文化”。具体到苏州园林，那不妨再加一点评弹的叮冬弦索声。蒙蒙细雨中，走在长长巷子的青石板路上，隔着长满苔藓的高墙，从偶然伸出墙头的翠绿的老树叉丫间，传出一两声叮冬弦索声……也像在日本京都小街巷的细雨中，从不高的木楼房二阶的纸窗中传出一二响三味弦的低沉声一样，给人的都是纯东方的盈漾着悠久历史文化的艺术感受。要感受到它，纵然需要有生物学、遗传学所说的遗传基因，但更需有后天的环境熏陶，家庭、学校、社会的文化教育。
    苏州园林的特征，大约有三：一是其历史悠久延续时间长，绵绵不断。不要说春秋时代的吴王馆娃宫，东晋时的顾辟疆园，五代时广陵王的金谷园，宋时苏子美的沧浪亭，即使是明、清以来的狮子林、拙政园及近世的耦园、曲园、怡园等，也都有其明晰的历史。岁月流逝、沧桑经历，均足以使游客凭吊今古，感慨人生。如果了解得更具体一些，就可以想象其时、其地、其人、其事，音容笑貌，人物风流……那游客也就会有后之视今，亦犹今之视昔之感，把自己也融化在历史的文化长河中了。二是其艺术的高超与独特。园林是园艺、建筑、绘画的综合艺术。其风格的形成，除创造者的艺术才思和传统文化的影响而外，还与自然地理有着密切的关系。唐代杜荀鹤诗云：“君到姑苏见，人家尽枕河。古宫闲地少，水港小桥多……”又道：“有园多种桔，无水不生莲，夜市桥边火，春风市外船……”这都很形象地说出了苏州的特征。苏州有山有水，气候温和，四季分明，土地肥腴，给建造园林提供非常有利的物质条件。有水易于引水营造池沼，有山易于取石，且有名贵的太湖石，土地、气候易于花木生长，四季易于选景、易于莳花，春夏秋冬都有变化不同的景可看，花可赏。人文荟粹，代有造园名家，由宋代主管花石纲的朱勔，到元代倪瓒、明代文征明、清代前期张南垣、戈裕良等累代经营，形成了由堆石、引水、建亭、置榭、畦花、艺树等一整套能代表高深江南文化的苏州园林艺术风格。三是苏州园林，按中国古典园林宫廷、寺庙、第宅三大类分之，大多是属于私人第宅园林的，大多和住宅是连在一起的。
    在改革开放的今天，苏州园林的游人，大量增加，几乎无所谓淡季、旺季之分，每天世界各地的旅游者涌向苏州，全国各地的旅游者涌向苏州，苏州当地的游客，反而占少数了。虎丘一片小小的千人石，现在人多时，有三四万游客，纵然是鱼贯而过，也还是人潮的浪涌，又如何感受苏州园林的历史文化气氛，品味其艺术境界呢？
    苏州园林局在北寺塔举办了“苏州古典园林艺术陈列室”，并以此为基础，积极筹备在拙政园西侧，开办“苏州园林艺术博物馆”，使慕苏州古典园林之名，不远千里万里而来的广大海内外游客，于游览各处名园，获得大量直接感受之后，在园林博物馆中，更得到系统的有关苏州园林历史的、文化的、艺术的知识，真正感受它文化的深度、艺术的美。
    苏州园林博物馆的筹建，对于弘扬中华民族的历史文化，发展江南园林艺术，丰富广大中外旅游者的观光游览内容，都是极为重要的。
