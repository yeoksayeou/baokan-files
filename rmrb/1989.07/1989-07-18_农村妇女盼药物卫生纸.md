Currently in rural areas, due to various reasons, many women suffer from gynecological diseases. Because of poor medical conditions, a lack of doctors and medicine, and some women's reluctance to speak up and seek treatment, many women delay seeking medical help. Some even face tragic outcomes. Therefore, they need to use sanitary napkins that have some therapeutic effects and can prevent diseases, thereby improving their health levels. However, such sanitary napkins are hard to find in rural areas. They eagerly hope that state-owned or individual businesses can organize supplies to meet the demand in rural areas.

    农村妇女盼药物卫生纸
    目前在农村，因诸种原因患妇科病的妇女较多。由于农村医疗条件差、缺医少药，再加之个别人羞于启口而讳疾忌医，以至延误病情。有的甚至酿成悲剧。为此，她们需要使用具有一定疗效而且能够起到预防疾病效果的药物卫生纸，提高健康水平。但这种卫生纸在农村很难买到，她们急切盼望国营或个体经营者能组织货源供应农村。
