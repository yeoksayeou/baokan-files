The sixth conference of the World Futures Studies Federation, themed "Prospects for the Future: The 1990s and the 21st Century," concluded today in Washington. Over the course of five days, more than 3,000 futurists from around the world engaged in heated discussions on six key topics: the economic sphere, technological sphere, biosphere, social sphere, political sphere, and the sphere of futures studies. They explored the challenges and opportunities the world will face from various angles and proposed several strategic options and measures.

Experts participating in the economic sphere discussions generally agreed that global economic relations will undergo significant changes in the 1990s, with the most notable being the dual trends of globalization and regionalization. Globalization refers to closer economic interactions and cooperation among countries, while regionalization pertains to the internal unified market of the European Community by 1992, the North American Free Trade Area, the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, and the Asia-Pacific economic circle. In terms of macroeconomic management, some experts pointed out that policy coordination among Western countries will further strengthen, but a large number of developing countries should also have a say. Others emphasized that accurately predicting long-term economic fluctuations and cycles is crucial for decision-making by governments, enterprises, and individuals. With intensified global competition and rapid technological advancements, enterprises need to explore new management methods to address future challenges and seize new opportunities. Since adopting new technologies is the foundation of economic development, universities, governments, and enterprises should collaborate to promote economic growth.

During the discussions on the technological sphere, experts noted that new technologies can drive human progress in economics, society, and culture. Specifically, today's new technologies primarily include information technology and biotechnology. In the next century, these two technologies, especially information technology, will see even greater development. Advances in biotechnology will significantly impact industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and medicine. Some experts also pointed out that the development of new technologies can bring certain adverse effects, such as the modernization of various weapons and the arms race in outer space. Therefore, there is also the issue of correct choices in developing new technologies.

Education was a major topic in the social sphere discussions. Many experts believe that reforming education to adapt to the new situation in the 21st century is a significant task for all countries, as economic development is closely linked to people's educational attainment.

Biological experts attending the conference focused on the relationship between human activities and the natural environment. Many experts pointed out that the main challenges humanity will face in the next century include environmental pollution, resource depletion, rising temperatures, and rapid population growth. Solving these global issues requires the collective efforts of all countries around the world.

    未来学会第六届大会闭幕
    研讨世界面临的挑战和机遇
    本报华盛顿7月20日电　记者张亮报道：以《展望未来：90年代及21世纪》为题的世界未来学会第六届大会今天在这里闭幕。在为期5天的大会上，来自世界各国的3000多名未来学家就“经济圈、技术圈、生物圈、社会圈、政治圈和未来学圈”等6个专题进行了热烈的讨论。他们从各个不同的角度探讨了世界将面临的挑战与机遇，同时也提出了可供选择的一些战略和措施。
    参加经济圈专题讨论的专家们普遍认为，90年代世界经济关系将发生明显变化，其中最突出的是国际市场既一体化又区域化。所谓一体化就是各国之间的经济交往与合作更加密切，而区域化则是指欧共体1992年内部统一大市场、北美自由贸易区、经互会和亚太经济圈。在宏观经济管理方面，有的专家指出，西方国家的政策协调将会进一步加强，但为数众多的发展中国家也应当有发言权。有的人还强调，比较准确地预测长远的经济起落和周期对政府、企业和个人的决策都是至关重要的。随着全球竞争的加剧和科学技术的日新月异，企业需要探索新的经营管理方式，以对付未来的挑战和争取新的机会。由于采用新技术是经济发展的基础，高等院校、政府和企业三方应当为促进经济发展而通力合作。
    在讨论技术圈问题时，专家们指出新技术可以促进人类在经济、社会和文化等领域的发展。具体来说，当今新技术主要有两种，一是信息技术，二是生物技术。在下个世纪，这两种新技术特别是信息技术将会得到更大的发展。而生物技术的进步发展将会对工农业和医药等部门产生很大影响。有些专家也指出，新技术的发展也会带来某些不良后果，如各种武器的现代化和外层空间的军备竞赛。所以，在开发新技术方面还有一个正确选择的问题。
    教育是社会圈专题的一个主要议题。许多专家认为，如何改革教育以适应21世纪的新形势是各国面临的一个大课题，因为经济发展与人的教育素质是密切相关的。
    与会的生物专家着重讨论了人类活动与自然环境的关系。许多专家指出，人类在下个世纪面临的主要问题是环境污染、资源减少、气温升高和人口急剧增加，而解决这些全球性问题要靠世界各国的共同努力。
