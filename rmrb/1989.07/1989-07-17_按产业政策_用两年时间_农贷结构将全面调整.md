The Agricultural Bank of China has decided: starting from now until the end of 1991, within two years, guided by national industrial policies and with the aim of improving the efficiency of capital use, the bank will, in a planned and organized manner, comprehensively adjust the structure of rural credit. This information was obtained by the reporter from the National Branch Managers' Meeting of the Agricultural Bank currently being held in Xining.

The Agricultural Bank began a comprehensive cleanup of its credit assets in March of last year. The results of this cleanup indicate that there are still many problems with the current structure of rural credit. If these issues are not addressed promptly, the total amount of credit will not be effectively controlled. This adjustment of the credit structure will focus on three main areas: First, adjusting the industrial structure of loans. Gradually increasing the proportion of agricultural loans and controlling the rapid growth of industrial loans, including those for township enterprises. Agricultural loans should prioritize supporting the development of planting and breeding industries, the promotion and application of agricultural technology, and the development of agricultural resources. Second, adjusting the enterprise structure of loans. The focus should be on improving the credit rating of loan enterprises. By reducing and withdrawing unreasonable loans and increasing new loans, the goal is to have loans to first-class enterprises account for more than 60%, loans to second-class enterprises account for about 20%, and loans to third-class enterprises and those that are being closed down should be reduced to within 20%. Third, adjusting the capital structure of loans. Collecting various overdue loans and unreasonable occupied loans, and managing new loans effectively.

    按产业政策　用两年时间
    农贷结构将全面调整
    本报西宁七月十七日讯　记者江夏报道：中国农业银行决定：从现在起到一九九一年底，用两年时间，以国家产业政策为导向，提高资金使用效益为中心，有领导、有计划地集中对农村信贷结构进行全面调整。这是记者从正在此间召开的农业银行全国分行长会议上获悉的。
    农业银行从去年三月开始，对信贷资产进行了全面清理。清资结果表明，目前农村信贷结构还存在不少问题，如不及时加以调整，信贷总量就得不到真正的控制。这次信贷结构的调整，主要围绕三个方面进行：一是调整贷款的产业结构。逐步提高农业贷款的比例，控制工业贷款包括乡镇企业贷款的过速增长。农业贷款要优先支持种植业、养殖业的发展，支持农业科技的推广应用和农业资源的开发。二是调整贷款的企业结构。把工作重点放在提高贷款企业的等级水平上，通过压缩抽回不合理贷款和新增贷款，做到一类企业的贷款占到百分之六十以上，二类企业的贷款占百分之二十左右，三类企业和关停企业贷款下降到百分之二十以内。三是调整贷款的资金结构，清收各种欠款和不合理占用的贷款，管好新放贷款。
