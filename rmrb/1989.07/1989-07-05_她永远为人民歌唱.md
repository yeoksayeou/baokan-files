She Will Always Sing for the People

Famous Lebanese singer Fayrouz is deeply loved and respected by the people. Whether in times of peace and joy or during the smoke and fire of war, Fayrouz has always been with her country and her people, just as she sings in her song "Lebanon, My Homeland, I Love You!"

Lebanon, my homeland, I love you!
I love your north,
I love your south,
I love your vast plains.
I wish to stay by your side,
Even if people leave,
Everything around disappears,
The earth turns into ruins,
Many sleepless nights,
I stand guard at your door,
Protecting you!
Lebanon, my homeland, I love you.

War spreads everywhere,
Smoke covers the land,
Lebanon is dignified,
The people are resolute,
Our country will rise again.
Once we are separated,
Love brings us together,
Every grain of your soil,
Is a treasure on earth,
Lebanon, my homeland, I love you!

This Lebanese song is one of Fayrouz's signature pieces, and almost every Lebanese person can sing it. Whenever Fayrouz sings this song on stage, she cannot help but shed tears, and the Lebanese people in the audience, hearing the song, are moved to tears by the sight of their ruined homeland. Though Lebanon is wounded, Fayrouz wishes to stay by its side. Someone asked Fayrouz, "Have you ever thought of leaving Lebanon?" Fayrouz replied, "The Lebanese civil war has been going on for more than a decade, but I have never thought of leaving my homeland. Bombing is indeed terrifying, but I am willing to sit in a small corner of my house, waiting..." Fayrouz is waiting, waiting for the day when her country will rise again. She is truly a righteous and patriotic artist. Fayrouz's voice not only captivates Lebanon but also the entire Arab world. In Arab countries, most families have Fayrouz's records and cassette tapes. Someone once made the following statistic: in the song programs broadcast by radio stations in various Arab countries, on average, one out of every four songs is sung by Fayrouz.

Fayrouz was born in Anjar, north of Beirut. At the age of fourteen, she was recommended to join the Lebanese Radio Chorus. The audition committee, composed of famous singers and composers, was greatly impressed by her singing. In the rehearsal hall of the radio station, the young composer Assi Rahbani discovered her enchanting voice and outstanding singing talent and decided to nurture her. Assi Rahbani's brother Mansour wrote lyrics for her, and Assi himself composed music for the lyrics. Fayrouz's singing, Mansour's lyrics, and Assi's music combined to reach a state of perfection, and people called this combination the "genius trio." Later, Fayrouz married Assi Rahbani, and after marriage, her artistic talents were fully developed. The songs composed by Rahbani and sung by Fayrouz are considered a "revolution" in Arab music.

Fayrouz's singing is not only beautiful and moving but also filled with love for her homeland, the Palestinian people, and the entire Arab nation. Her footsteps have reached Lebanon and various Arab countries, as well as many countries around the world. She has also performed in Palestinian refugee camps for her Palestinian brothers and sisters.

Come back!
Love and peace.
Come back!
Green Lebanon,
United Lebanon.

Fayrouz uses her voice to call for peace and love. Her voice reaches every street and alley, every barricade and trench. People and soldiers, regardless of their factions and beliefs, all listen attentively. Today, people call Fayrouz the angel of peace and love.

    她永远为人民歌唱
    刘元培
    蜚声黎巴嫩乐坛的著名女歌唱家菲露兹深受人民的热爱和尊敬。无论在充满欢乐的和平时期，还是在硝烟弥漫的战争年代，菲露兹一直与自己的国家和人民在一起，正如她在《黎巴嫩，我的祖国，我爱你》！一歌中唱的那样。
    黎巴嫩，我的祖国，我爱你！
    爱你的北方，
    爱你的南方，
    爱你的广阔原野。
    我愿留在你身边，
    即使人们离去，
    周围一切消失，
    大地变成废墟，
    多少个不眠之夜，
    我守卫在你的大门
    护卫着你！
    黎巴嫩，我的祖国，我爱你。
    到处战火蔓延，
    硝烟笼罩大地，
    黎巴嫩有尊严，
    人民有骨气，
    我们的国家在重起。
    一旦我们分离，
    爱又把我们团聚，
    你每一颗土粒，
    犹如人间稀宝，
    黎巴嫩，我的祖国，我爱你！
    这首黎巴嫩歌曲，是菲露兹经常演唱的保留曲目，几乎每个黎巴嫩人都会唱。每当菲露兹在舞台上演唱这首歌的时候，自己不禁流下热泪，在场的黎巴嫩人闻曲伤情，对毁坏的家园无不痛心，也不禁凄然泪下。祖国遍体鳞伤，但菲露兹愿留在她的身边。有人问菲露兹：“你可曾想过离开黎巴嫩？”菲露兹回答说：“黎巴嫩内战已十几年了，但我从未想过离开祖国。轰炸确实可怕，但我愿坐在屋内小小的一角，等待……。”菲露兹在等待，等待祖国重起的那一天。她真不愧为一位正直、爱国的艺术家。菲露兹的歌声不仅在黎巴嫩，而且在整个阿拉伯世界，具有极大的魅力。在阿拉伯国家，大部分家庭都有菲露兹演唱的唱片和盒式带。曾有人作过如下统计：阿拉伯各国电台播放的歌曲节目中，平均每四支歌中就有一支菲露兹唱的歌。
    菲露兹出生于贝鲁特以北的安特里阿斯。十四岁那年，她经人推荐，到黎巴嫩电台合唱队当合唱队员。由著名歌唱家、作曲家组成的审听委员会对她的演唱大为赞赏。在电台排演厅内，当时年轻的作曲家阿齐·拉赫巴尼发现了她的动人的嗓音和高超的歌唱才能，决心培养她。阿齐·拉赫巴尼的弟弟曼苏尔为她写歌词，阿齐本人为歌词谱曲。菲露兹的唱，曼苏尔的词，阿齐的曲，这三者的结合，达到了炉火纯青的境地，人们称这结合为“天才的三合体”。后来，菲露兹与阿齐·拉赫巴尼结了婚，婚后，她的艺术才华得以更充分的发挥。由拉赫巴尼谱曲，菲露兹演唱的歌曲被称为对阿拉伯歌曲的一次“革新”。
    菲露兹的演唱不仅优美动听，而且充满对祖国、对巴勒斯坦人民和整个阿拉伯民族的爱。她的足迹遍及黎巴嫩和阿拉伯各国以及世界许多国家。她也深入到巴勒斯坦难民营，为兄弟的巴勒斯坦难民和战士们演唱。
    归来吧！
    友爱、和平。
    归来吧！
    绿色的黎巴嫩，
    统一的黎巴嫩。
    菲露兹用自己的歌喉呼吁和平与友爱。她的歌声传到大街小巷、街垒、战壕，百姓和战士都不分派别和信仰，个个侧耳细听。今天，人们称菲露兹是和平与友爱的天使。（附图片）
