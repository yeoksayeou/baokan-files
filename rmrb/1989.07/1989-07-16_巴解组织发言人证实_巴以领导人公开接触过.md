Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, July 15th. According to a report from the Tunis Times, on the 13th, PLO spokesperson Ahmed Abdurrahman confirmed in Tunis that members of the PLO have had public contact with Israeli leaders.

Abdurrahman said that for the sake of promoting peace talks, Israelis have had some contact with PLO members, including a special envoy of Israeli Defense Minister Rabin. The most recent contact was between an Israeli Jewish delegation and PLO Executive Committee member Abu Mazen in early July in Toledo, Spain. He pointed out that Israeli Prime Minister Shamir was obviously aware of the contact between some of his ministers and members of the PLO, but Israeli officials have flatly denied these contacts.

Abdurrahman confirmed that Palestinian leaders are not only prepared to have contact with Israelis but are also prepared to engage in formal negotiations with them to convene an international conference.

    巴解组织发言人证实
    巴以领导人公开接触过
    新华社突尼斯7月15日电　据突尼斯《时报》报道，巴解组织发言人艾哈迈德·阿卜杜拉赫曼13日在这里证实，巴解组织成员曾同以色列领导人进行过公开接触。
    阿卜杜拉赫曼说，为了促进和平对话，以色列人同巴解组织成员进行过一些接触，其中包括以色列国防部长拉宾的特使同巴解组织进行过接触。最近的一次是由一个以色列犹太人代表团同巴解组织执委会委员阿布·马赞7月初在西班牙的托莱多进行的。他指出，以色列总理沙米尔对其某些部长和议员同巴解组织成员的接触显然是知道的，但以色列官员却断然否认这些接触。
    阿卜杜拉赫曼确认，巴勒斯坦领导人不仅准备同以色列人进行接触，而且还准备为召开一次国际会议而同他们进行正式谈判。
