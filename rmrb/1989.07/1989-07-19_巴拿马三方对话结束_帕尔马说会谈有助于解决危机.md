Panama Three-Way Talks Conclude
Palma Says Talks Help Resolve Crisis

	New York, July 17 (Xinhua) - The three-way talks between the ruling military junta and the opposition parties in Panama concluded on the evening of the 17th. They all agreed that holding these talks was a positive outcome of the mediation by the Organization of American States.

	It is understood that during this three-way meeting, the government side demanded that the United States stop its military threats against Panama, withdraw the increased troops from the canal zone, stop economic sanctions, strictly implement the Panama Canal Treaty, and refrain from interfering in Panama's political affairs. The opposition parties, on the other hand, demanded respect for the results of the May 7 elections and the resignation of the military commander Noriega.

	After two days of discussion, although no specific agreement was reached, all parties expressed their willingness to consider each other's proposals to seek a more appropriate agreement that could lead to national reconciliation.

	Local observers believe that the effectiveness of the May 7 elections and whether Noriega will step down are the key issues that make it difficult for the government and the opposition to reach an agreement.

	New York, July 18 (Xinhua) - Panama's President Palma stated on the 18th that the three-way talks between the ruling party, the opposition parties, and the military in Panama are "a positive step" towards resolving the domestic crisis.

	Palma believes that for the Panama three-way talks to achieve results, it mainly depends on the parties involved showing goodwill and a realistic attitude. He said that in order to find a way to resolve the deepening domestic crisis caused by the annulment of the results of the May 7 elections, people of different positions in Panama still have "a long way to go."

	Palma emphasized that the government is ready to engage in dialogue with the opposition at any time, but this does not mean that the government is weak.

    巴拿马三方对话结束
    帕尔马说会谈有助于解决危机
    新华社巴拿马城7月17日电　巴拿马军方执政党和反对党举行的三方对话于17日晚结束。他们一致认为，举行这次对话是美洲国家组织斡旋的积极成果。
    据悉，在这次三方会谈中，政府方面要求美国停止对巴拿马的武力威胁，从运河地区撤出增加的兵力，停止经济制裁，严格执行巴美运河条约和不干涉巴拿马政治事务。而反对党则提出要尊重5月7日大选结果并要求国防军司令诺列加下台。
    经过两天的讨论，三方虽然没有达成任何具体的协议，但都表示同意考虑对方的建议，以便寻求达成一项能导致全国和解的更合适的协议方案。
    此间观察家认为，5月7日大选是否有效以及诺列加是否下台是政府与反对派难以达成协议的焦点。
    新华社巴拿马城7月18日电　巴拿马总统帕尔马18日发表谈话说，巴拿马执政党、反对党和军方举行的三方会谈是解决国内危机的“一个积极步骤”。
    帕尔马认为，巴拿马三方对话要获得成果，主要取决于有关各方能表现出良好愿望和现实主义态度。他说，为了寻求解决因5月7日大选结果作废而加深的国内危机的办法，各种不同立场的巴拿马人还需要“走很长的路”。
    帕尔马强调，政府随时准备同反对派进行对话，但这丝毫不意味着政府的软弱。
