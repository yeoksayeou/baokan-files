The Propaganda Department's Theoretical Bureau recently held a discussion, inviting some young and middle-aged theoretical workers from the capital to discuss how to follow Deng Xiaoping's important speech and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, to deeply carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, and to strengthen the Party's Marxist theoretical construction.

The attendees unanimously agreed that in recent years, bourgeois liberalization has spread rampantly, and the theoretical field is a major disaster area. The task of cleaning up and rectifying is very arduous. Deng Xiaoping's important speech and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee have pointed the direction for the theoretical field to adhere to Marxism and clarify the various theoretical right and wrongs that have been confused by bourgeois liberalization.

Xu Qixian, Deputy Director of the Marxist Theory Education Research Institute of Renmin University of China, said in his speech that in recent years, bourgeois liberalization has had a significant impact on young students. In colleges and universities, erroneous ideas such as "criticizing private ownership is a reaction against human nature," "public ownership is a paradise for a few people to pursue private interests," and "selfishness is human nature" have spread. This is directly related to the uncontrolled propaganda. Some newspapers openly advocate the superiority of private ownership, relentlessly criticize public ownership, and some even propose the fallacy of "dividing speculation into two" and "eating and drinking is productivity." The main reason for these situations is that Comrade Zhao Ziyang has taken a negative attitude towards adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles. He does not grasp the Party's construction and ideological and political work, but instead proposes to downplay the issue of Party style and reform the Party's ideological and political work, which is actually a cover-up and encouragement of bourgeois liberalization. If we do not genuinely oppose bourgeois liberalization, there is indeed a danger of the Party and the country perishing.

Zhi Xiaohua, Deputy Director of the Economics Department of Peking University, believes that to oppose bourgeois liberalization, we must first have a certain momentum, while also paying attention to policy. The previous two struggles against bourgeois liberalization did not proceed seriously, but instead became more and more intense. This lesson must be remembered.

Feng Yuzhang, Associate Professor of Tsinghua University, analyzed the three characteristics of the current spread of bourgeois liberalization. First, under the pretext of carrying out a "new enlightenment movement," it fundamentally denies the revolutionary path and history of China since the May Fourth Movement, as well as the current socialist system in our country, and under the banner of anti-feudalism, it opposes socialism. Second, under the guise of advocating general and pure democracy, it advocates bourgeois democracy, and under the pretext of opposing feudal autocracy, it opposes people's democratic dictatorship. Third, it uses the perspective of Western bourgeoisie to view socialist reform, incorporating it into the peaceful evolution track of capitalism. To oppose bourgeois liberalization, we must refute and expose it from the historical perspective, from the class nature of democracy, freedom, and human rights, and from the strategic intentions of international capitalism's peaceful evolution.

Zhang Qihua of the Seeking Truth magazine said that the manifestations of bourgeois liberalization are: advocating pluralism in the political field, privatization in the economic field, Westernization in the cultural field, and non-Marxism in the ideological field, with the center being capitalization. Some people distort the complete theory of Marxism, believing that Marxism is only a revolutionary theory and not a construction theory, and therefore want to change the theme, actually negating the basic principles of Marxism. However, the practice and writings of the founders of Marxism show that Marxism is not only critical but also constructive. It can guide both revolution and socialist construction.

Li Pengcheng of the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, believes that in recent years, there have been tendencies of economism, pragmatism, and spontaneity in theoretical work, and to some extent, the fundamental purpose of the Communist Party to build socialism and communism has been forgotten. To genuinely and effectively oppose bourgeois liberalization, we must establish the subjectivity of the Party's theory and strengthen the Party's theoretical construction. For this, I hope and appeal to the Party's leaders at all levels, especially senior cadres, to take the lead in studying Marxist theory.

Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, attended the discussion and spoke. He said that the task of opposing bourgeois liberalization is very arduous and must be carried out for a long time. Bourgeois liberalization is a political concept. It wants to negate the Party's leadership and the socialist system. However, as a trend, it can spread, and it also has a theoretical foundation, such as views on life, worldviews, values, literary views, and news views, involving various ideological fields. To thoroughly settle the accounts of bourgeois liberalization, we must delve into various ideological and theoretical fields.

Wang Renzhi expressed his high hopes for young and middle-aged theoretical workers. He said that opposing bourgeois liberalization relies on both senior comrades in the theoretical field and more on the youth. The youth may have a broader knowledge base and accept new things faster. The future belongs to the youth, and the responsibility of building and developing theory will fall on the shoulders of the youth. Cultivating and educating young and middle-aged theoretical workers is crucial. It relates to the future of our Party and country. If we do not pay attention to this issue, it will be very dangerous in the future. He hopes that young theoretical workers will not only study Marxist classics but also be familiar with Western academic works; not only understand the present but also understand history. In the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, they will be tempered. He hopes that everyone will unite and influence more young and middle-aged theoretical workers to write more articles that clearly and persuasively explain the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles.

Those who participated in the discussion and spoke included Liu Ben, Fang Li, Xu Jianyi, Tang Hejian, and Zhao Bingzhi.

    中宣部理论局邀请中青年理论工作者座谈
    理论界清理整顿任务相当艰巨  要深入各思想领域批判自由化
    新华社北京7月17日电  中宣部理论局近日召开座谈会，邀请首都部分中青年理论工作者，讨论如何按照邓小平同志的重要讲话和党的十三届四中全会精神，深入开展反对资产阶级自由化，切实加强党的马克思主义理论建设。
    与会同志一致认为，最近几年资产阶级自由化泛滥，理论界是重灾区，清理整顿的任务相当艰巨。邓小平同志的重要讲话和十三届四中全会精神，为理论界坚持马克思主义，澄清被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的各种理论是非，指明了方向。
    中国人民大学马克思主义理论教育研究所副所长许启贤在发言中说，近几年资产阶级自由化对青年学生的影响极大，高校中流传着“批判私有制是对人性的反动”、“公有制是少数人追求私利的天堂”、“自私是人的本性”等等错误思想观点，这与舆论宣传的失控有直接关系。一些报纸公开鼓吹私有制的优越性，不遗余力地抨击公有制，有的甚至提出“对投机要一分为二”、“吃吃喝喝就是生产力”的谬论。所以出现这些情况，主要原因是赵紫阳同志对坚持四项基本原则采取了消极态度，他不抓党的建设和思想政治工作，反而提出要淡化党风问题、改造党的思想政治工作，实际上是在包庇和纵容资产阶级自由化。现在，如果不切实地反对资产阶级自由化，确实有亡党亡国的危险。
    北京大学经济系副主任智孝和认为，反对资产阶级自由化，首先要有一定的声势，同时也要注意政策。前两次反对资产阶级自由化的斗争没有能认真地进行下去，反而越演越烈，这个教训一定要记取。
    清华大学冯虞章副教授分析了这次资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的三个特点，一是借口进行“新启蒙”运动，根本否定“五四”运动以来中国革命的道路和历史以及现在我国的社会制度，打着反封建主义的旗号反对社会主义；二是借讲一般的、纯粹的民主，主张资产阶级民主，借反对封建专制，反对人民民主专政；三是以西方资产阶级的观点来看待社会主义的改革，把改革纳入资本主义化的和平演变轨道。反对资产阶级自由化，要针对其特点，从历史的角度，从民主、自由、人权的阶级性，从国际资本主义的和平演变的战略企图几个方面予以驳斥和揭露。
    《求是》杂志社张启华说，资产阶级自由化的表现，在政治领域是主张多元化，经济领域主张私有化，文化领域主张西方化，思想领域主张非马克思主义化，中心是资本主义化。有的人歪曲马克思主义的完整学说，认为马克思主义只是革命的理论，不是建设的理论，因此要搞主题变换，实际是要否定马克思主义的基本原理。但是，马克思主义创始人的实践和著述，表明马克思主义不仅是批判性的，而且还是建设性的，它既能指导革命，也能指导社会主义建设。
    中国社会科学院哲学所李鹏程认为，最近几年，理论工作中存在着经济主义、实用主义、自发主义倾向，在某种程度上忘记了共产党的根本宗旨是搞社会主义、搞共产主义。要切实有效地反对资产阶级自由化，就要确立党的理论的主体性，要大力加强党的理论建设。为此，我希望并呼吁党的各级领导干部，特别是高级干部，必须带头学习马克思主义理论。
    中宣部部长王忍之参加了座谈会，并讲了话。他说，反对资产阶级自由化的任务十分艰巨，要长期搞下去。资产阶级自由化是一个政治概念，它要否定党的领导，否定社会主义制度。但是，它作为一股思潮并能泛滥起来，还有其思想理论基础，如人生观、世界观、价值观、文艺观、新闻观等，涉及各个思想领域。要彻底清算资产阶级自由化，就必须深入到各个思想理论领域。
    王忍之同志对中青年理论工作者寄以厚望。他说，反对资产阶级自由化要靠理论界的老同志，但更要靠中青年，靠大家都来发挥作用。中青年知识面可能宽一点，接受新东西快一点，未来属于青年一代，建设理论和发展理论的重担将落在青年人身上。对中青年理论工作者要培养、教育，这至关重要，它关系到我们党和国家的前途命运。如果不重视这个问题，将来是相当危险的。他希望青年理论工作者不仅要研读马克思主义基本著作，而且也要熟悉西方的学术著作；不仅要了解现在，还要了解历史，在反对资产阶级自由化的斗争中经受锻炼，希望大家团结和影响更多的中青年理论工作者，写出更多的阐明坚持四项基本原则的有分析、有说服力的文章来。
    参加座谈会并发言的还有：刘奔、方立、徐建一、唐合俭、赵秉志。
