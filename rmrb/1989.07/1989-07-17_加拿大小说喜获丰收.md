Canadian literature, which had little influence abroad 20 years ago, has recently gained international attention due to the emergence of a group of talented novelists. Currently, 150 foreign universities offer courses on Canadian literature, and 14 countries, including the Soviet Union, the Netherlands, and India, have established Canadian literature research societies. Major publishers in the UK and the US are competing to publish Canadian literary masterpieces.

Margaret Atwood, aged 49, is one of the leading figures among these novelists. She is a poet and critic who published her first novel, "The Edible Woman," in 1969, showcasing her talent for novel writing. Subsequently, she published "Lady Oracle," "Surfacing," and "Life Before Man." Her 1986 novel "The Handmaid's Tale" and her 1988 novel "Cat's Eye" have earned her immense international acclaim. The protagonists of her novels are mostly young women, and her writing is delicate and emotionally sincere. For example, "The Edible Woman" tells the story of a female market researcher who develops anorexia after learning she will marry a bad man. "Cat's Eye" is a reflection on the life of a female painter. Atwood has become a significant figure in the Canadian literary scene, with her works selling millions of copies and being translated into over 20 languages in 25 countries. In the United States, the Margaret Atwood Society has been established to study her works.

Other notable new novelists include Gary Ross's "The Devil in the Flesh," which depicts the miserable life in a reformatory and portrays the psychological state of the inmates; Rick Salutin's "The White Side of the Moon," which describes a Holocaust survivor who, after abandoning his Jewish faith, feels spiritually empty and seeks to fill this void; and Matt Cohen's "The Disinherited," which narrates the story of a group of people who toil in obscurity all their lives but fail to achieve their dreams. Other excellent novels include Robertson Davies' "The Rebel Angels," Timothy Findley's "The Wars," and Michael Ondaatje's "In the Skin of a Lion."

Some veteran writers have also produced new works with a strong romantic flavor. At 85, Morley Callaghan published his 20th novel, "A Man of His Time," which tells the story of a renowned British journalist passing on his vibrant ideals to the younger generation. At 74, W.O. Mitchell published his 15th novel, "Who Has Seen the Wind," which describes a retired lonely scholar, Ken Leon, who takes in and protects a young single mother and her 5-year-old daughter, thereby rediscovering the joy of life.

Detective and thriller novels, which were previously almost unheard of, now have a group of writers including Wright, DeVille, Templeton, and Bass. Notable works include Eric Wright's "The Best Laid Plans."

    申奥
    20年前加拿大文学在国外的影响尚小，近年来由于涌现了一群才华出众的小说家，已为举世瞩目。现在有150所外国大学开设了加拿大文学课程，在苏联、荷兰、印度等14个国家成立了加拿大文学研究会，英美的各大出版社竞相推出加拿大的文学精品。
    现年49岁的玛格丽特·阿特伍德是这群小说家中佼佼者。她是诗人和评论家，1969年发表第一部小说《厌食妇人》，展露了小说创作的才能。以后她又陆续发表了小说《神谕夫人》、《表面》和《在男子汉前的生活》，1986年出版的《女仆的故事》和去年出版的《猫眼》，使她获得了巨大的国际声誉。她的小说，主人公都是年轻妇女，描写细腻，感情真挚。例如《厌食妇女》是叙述一位女市场研究员得知将与一个坏人结婚后便得了厌食症的痛苦经历。《猫眼》是一位女画家对自己一生的回顾与反思。目前阿特伍德已成为加拿大文坛举足轻重的人物，她的作品已销售数百万册，被译成20多种文字在25个国家出版。在美国还成立了专门研究她的阿特伍德学会。
    重要的新小说家的作品还有加利·罗思的《月亮之泪》，反映感化院中的悲惨生活，刻画了犯人们的心理状态；里克·萨纽汀的《无信仰的人》描写一个纳粹集中营的幸存者由于放弃了犹太教信仰，感到精神上的空虚，力图寻求一些东西来填补这个真空；马特·柯亨的《生活在水上》，记述一群人默默无闻地辛勤劳动一生却无法实现自己的愿望。其他优秀小说还有罗伯逊·戴维斯的《骨子里包藏什么》、蒂莫塞·芬德勒的《著名的遗言》和迈克尔·翁达捷的《在狮皮中》等。
    一些老作家也焕发了青春，写出了浪漫色彩浓厚的新作。85岁的莫莱·加拉翰的第20部小说《旅途中的一个狂妄老人》，叙述一位有声望的英国记者把他的富有朝气的理想传递给青年一代；74岁的威·奥·米切尔的第15部小说《瓢虫，瓢虫》，描写一位退休的孤独学者肯·莱昂收容并保护了一个年轻的单身母亲和她的5岁女孩，因而重新感到人生的欢乐。
    侦探和惊险小说过去几乎无人涉足，现在这个领域已拥有赖特、德维勒耳、腾普莱顿、巴斯等一批作家。较著名的作品有杨格的《严寒中的谋杀》。
