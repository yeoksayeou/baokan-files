Title: "Cannot" and "Will Not"

There was a news report about the multiple imported Kamaz trucks in the Second Section of the 16th Bureau of the Ministry of Railways that had "broken down." They originally planned to replace the imported parts at a high cost and contacted several repair units. The comrades from these repair units said, "We don't dare to touch these foreign things." With no other choice, the Second Section took matters into their own hands, using domestically produced materials to manufacture the parts, and repaired the trucks in a month, reducing the repair costs by two-thirds.

The problem of difficulty in repairing imported equipment is quite common. Nationwide, there are a significant number of equipment and vehicles that are idle or scrapped due to the inability to repair them in a timely manner. According to statistics, there are approximately 30,000 Kamaz trucks like those in the Second Section of the 16th Bureau nationwide, and one-third of them have "broken down" within two years of use. This is a huge waste. Why does this situation occur? Analyzing the reasons, it is undoubtedly related to the level of domestic materials and technology, but psychological barriers are equally not to be overlooked. This is the fear of foreign technology, believing that our own level is not enough, and when imported equipment has problems, either seeking help from foreign technicians or simply abandoning it without a fight. This psychology can be said to be one of blind dependence and inaction, and the waste of national resources it causes is heartbreaking. The repair of the Kamaz trucks shows that many things are not "cannot" but "will not." Things that were originally considered "not to be touched" were successfully handled through our own efforts. If we are already behind, and do not work hard to study and research, relying on others for everything, what hope is there for catching up? Therefore, opening up to the outside world requires us to have this spirit, a spirit of self-respect: things that we can strive to do ourselves, we must do ourselves. This spirit is also beneficial for accelerating the digestion and absorption of imported equipment and technology.

Importing technology and equipment is to accelerate our self-reliance and create good conditions for ourselves. If after opening up, we are able to do but do not do, relying on everything from abroad, the result will be even less self-reliance. Recognizing this truth and truly starting from ourselves in our work, consciously and proactively doing things. In small matters, our waste of imported equipment and vehicles will be reduced; in big matters, the overall economic development will be healthier and faster.

### “不能”与“不为”

    “不能”与“不为”
    级平  正风
    看到这样一则消息：铁道部十六局二处的多台进口卡玛斯汽车“抛锚”，他们原准备花高价更换进口配件，找了几个修理单位。这些修理单位的同志说：“这洋玩艺儿，我们不敢碰。”无奈，该处自己动手，利用国产材料加工出配件，一个月内修复了卡车，修理费用降低了2／3。
    进口设备维修难的问题相当普遍，全国因不能及时维修而闲置、报废的设备、车辆数目可观。据统计，像十六局二处自己维修的“卡玛斯”汽车，全国约有3万辆，而使用二年内“趴窝”者达1／3。这是一个很大的浪费。为什么会出现这种情况呢？分析其原因，固然同国内的材料和技术水平有关，但是心理上的障碍同样不可忽视。这就是惧“洋”，认为自己水平不行，进口设备出了毛病，或求救于国外技术人员，或干脆弃置一边，不战而退。这种心理，可以说是一种盲目依赖和无所作为的心理，由此而浪费的国家资财，令人痛心。“卡玛斯”汽车的修理说明，许多事情不是“不能”，而是“不为”。原先“不敢碰”的东西，经过自己的努力，不仅“碰”了，而且成功了。本来就落后，再不下功夫钻研，事事依赖人家，还有什么追赶的希望？因此，对外开放需要我们有这样一股劲，一种争气精神：自己能努力做到的事情，就要自己去做。这种精神也有利于加快引进设备技术的消化吸收。
    引进技术和设备，是为了加速我们的自立，为自己创造好的条件。如果开放后，我们能为而不为，什么都依赖国外，其结局会更加不自立。认清这个道理，并在工作中真正从自身做起，自觉、主动地去做。从小处讲，我们的进口设备、车辆浪费会减少；从大处讲，整个经济发展才会更健康、更迅速。
