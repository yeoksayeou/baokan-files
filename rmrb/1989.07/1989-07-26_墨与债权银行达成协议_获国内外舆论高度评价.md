Mexico and creditor banks reached an agreement on July 23, which has been highly praised by domestic and international public opinion.

Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Mexico City on July 24: Various sectors in Mexico today believe that the agreement reached between Mexico and creditor banks on July 23 has freed Mexico from the heavy burden of debt, providing it with the opportunity for renewed growth.

The finance minister leading the debt negotiations, Aspe, said that the agreement has expanded Mexico's economic growth prospects. Leaders of both houses of the Mexican Congress and opposition parties also expressed satisfaction with the agreement, calling it a "historic event" that "solves the problems Mexico faces today and tomorrow" and is a "guarantee for the completion of the national development plan."

The agreement between Mexico and creditor banks has also drawn the attention of the international community. The European Community believes that the agreement between international private banks and Mexico "is the first in a series of such agreements and will help in the reasonable development of the economies of developing countries." French President Mitterrand sent a letter to Salinas, stating that the agreement "helps Mexico's development and sets a precedent for other countries to achieve similar agreements." U.S. President Bush spoke with Salinas today, calling it "an outstanding agreement." U.S. Treasury Secretary Brady said, "Mexico has become the first beneficiary of the Brady Plan." The executive secretary of the Economic Commission for Latin America, Rosenthal, hopes that the agreement between Mexico and creditor banks can be the beginning of solving the debt problems of Latin American countries.

    获国内外舆论高度评价
    本报墨西哥城7月24日电　记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥各界人士今天认为，墨西哥与债权银行23日达成的协议，使墨西哥摆脱了沉重的债务负担，获得了重新增长的机会。
    主持债务谈判的财政部长阿斯佩说，协议扩大了墨西哥经济增长的余地。墨西哥参众两院领导人及反对党也对协议表示满意。认为这是一个“历史性的事件”。“解决了墨西哥今天与明天面临的问题”，是对“完成国家发展计划的保证”。
    墨西哥与债权银行的协议还引起了世界各国舆论的重视。欧洲共同体认为，国际私人银行与墨西哥达成的协议，“是一系列这样的协议的第一个，将会有助于发展中国家经济的合理发展”。法国总统密特朗致函萨利纳斯说，这一协议“有助于墨西哥的发展，并为其它国家取得类似协议开辟了先例”。美国总统布什今天与萨利纳斯通了电话，称这“是一个了不起的协议”。美国财政部长布雷迪说：“墨西哥已经成为布雷迪计划的第一个受益者。”拉美经济委员会执行秘书罗森塔尔要求墨西哥与债权银行的协议能够成为解决拉美国家债务问题的开始。
