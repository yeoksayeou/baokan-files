	Nine-Lobed Maple
	Guo Jianying

	I don't know if there is a name called "Nine-Lobed Maple," but it is much more beautiful than the common three-lobed fragrance maple.

	At this moment, in front of me, there is a nine-lobed red maple leaf, with extremely vibrant colors, as if it was just picked from a deep, drunken autumn, still dripping with a distant, rich fragrance. But it is like a dream held in the hand, easily shattered with a slight touch. Looking at it is like looking at a story. Yes, "Nine-Lobed Maple" is a dream, a story.

	In war, human life is measured in segments of time or even by the hour. Just moments ago, someone was laughing and singing, but suddenly a shell falls, and a group of young people suddenly loses someone, never to be found again. Therefore, in war, human life consciousness is particularly alert and clear. One can listen to and touch one's own life. Such a life is always loving and responsive. At that time, I was sixteen years old, just past my teenage years, nothing had happened yet, but I was waiting, and in my memory, that age was a morning glory flower in the dawn, shouting towards the sunlight. At that time, I loved to lie on the observation post's telescope and look towards the battlefield at dawn. I don't know why I liked the battlefield at dawn. The cannons that roared all night were now silent, the gunpowder smoke had dissipated, and in front of me, the soil with a strong burnt smell contained vast tranquility. But the sun would rise from this tranquility, and a river of sunlight would flow down on the soil filled with shell holes. This is everything, but the contrast and difference between the sun and the battlefield, as well as the brilliance and eternity of the sunlight, moved me so much. Of course, sometimes a bird would fearlessly fly down, sing a burst of rain-like songs, and then fly away. But on that day, the heart was filled with transparent bird songs, and the cannons would not drown them out. Many years later, I realized that this was a longing, a mysterious longing surging from the secrets of life. Both the bird and I had this feeling.

	Here, there used to be a world of nine-lobed maples. Every time the first frost fell, the nine-lobed maples on the hills would all turn red, and the morning light would shine on the maple leaves, and everywhere under the maple leaves, bird songs would resonate, and the sky would be filled with layers of round, red jade-like sounds. Now, all of this has become a dream shattered by shrapnel.

	But the vast universe is both stern and warm-hearted. No matter what disasters humanity suffers, the sun still rises and sets.

	On this day, just as the sun began to rise, I suddenly discovered a cluster of maple leaves through the telescope. This cluster of red maples was like a burning hand that touched my eyes and my heart heavily, both hot and painful, and became a brand in my memory. Every time I see a nine-lobed maple, this hot and painful feeling surges up. But here, the land was plowed by shells several times a day, and it had been plowed for more than two years. Where could maple leaves grow? I knew that there was still a tree standing here, which had been bathed in shell fragments for more than two years, with its body full of shrapnel, but it stood alone and did not fall. Who would have thought that a bunch of maple leaves could grow on that charred body!

	War wants to kill life, but what it cannot kill is life. These maple leaves were like a cluster of fresh blood surging from the deep rings of the dead tree, declaring the tenacity of life. From then on, many soldiers rushed to the observation post to look at that cluster of maple leaves. After each night battle, the surviving soldiers would send greetings to the maple leaves through the telescope at dawn. But each time they went out, someone would not return, and each time they looked at the maple leaves, there were fewer pairs of young eyes. When I looked at it for the last time, it was like a fire, shining brightly from the background of shell holes, transmitting a flashing shout.

	One day, a female cultural worker who came to perform on the front line was passing by it, and the messenger who was leading the way picked a bunch of maple leaves from the charred branches for her. People said that the female cultural worker was already nineteen years old and was the goddess that the messenger admired. But the soldiers still fired several shots into the sky, executing their will against the killers of life. From then on, I no longer came to look at the battlefield at dawn. I only wanted to leave a scorching brand in my heart.

	After the war stopped, both I and the nineteen-year-old female cultural worker walked out of this mountain of death, while the messenger and many young soldiers remained with the charred maple tree forever.

	Many years later, I found a battlefield diary from the ruins of the Tangshan earthquake, and in the yellowed pages, there was still a preserved bunch of crimson nine-lobed maples...

	This is the nine-lobed maple, this is a story.

    九裂枫
    郭建英
    我不知道是否有“九裂枫”的名称，反正它比常见的叶为三裂的香枫美妙得多了。
    此刻，我面前正放着一片叶为九裂的红枫，色泽极为艳丽，像刚从沉酣的醉秋中摘来，似乎还滴淋着深远的醇香。但是，它像个手捧的梦，轻轻地碰一下就会粉碎。望着它，就像望着一个故事。是的，“九裂枫”是一个梦，一个故事。
    战争中，人的生命要一段路程一段路程或一个钟点一个钟点来计算的。刚才还一面欢笑一面歌唱，忽然一枚炮弹落下，一群年轻人中竟有人丢失了，永远找不着了。因此，战争中人的生命意识是格外警惕而清醒的，自己都可以谛听和触摸。这样的生命总在热爱着，感应着。那时，我十六岁，刚过了少年时期，什么也不曾到来，但我在等待着，在我的记忆中那年龄是一朵晨曦中的喇叭花，正朝着阳光呼喊。那时，我最爱伏在观察所的望远镜上向黎明的战场瞭望。不知为什么我喜欢黎明的战场。一夜吼哮的大炮此刻沉寂了，硝烟消散了，面前那焦味浓烈的泥土里包含着广阔的宁静，但太阳会从这宁静中升起来，弹坑累累的泥土上会泄下一条阳光的大河。这就是一切，但是太阳与战场的对比与反差以及阳光的灿烂和永恒都使我那么感动。当然，有时候也会有一只飞鸟不顾生死地落下来，吐出一阵急雨似的歌又旋即飞去。不过，这一天心中都响彻着透明的鸟歌，大炮也不会淹没。多年以后我才懂得，这是一种眷恋，从生命的奥秘中涌出的冥冥的眷恋。我与鸟都有这种情愫。
    这里，原来是九裂枫的世界，每当秋霜初降，满山岗重重叠叠的九裂枫就全染红了，晨光一照，枫叶下到处喧响着鸟歌，天空里也溅落着一叠一重浑圆的声音的红玛瑙。现在，这一切已成为被弹片切碎的梦。
    但是，大宇宙既冷峻又热诚，不管人类遭受怎样的灾难，照样日出日落。
    就在这天太阳初露的时候，我突然从望远镜里发现了一丛枫叶。这一丛红枫像一只炽灼的手在我的眼睛以及我的心上都重重触摸了一下，既热又痛，而且成为记忆的烙印，每瞅见九裂枫就隐隐升腾起这种热痛的感觉。可是，这里一日要被炮弹耕耘数次，已经耕耘两年多了，哪里还会生出枫叶？我知道这里还兀立着一棵树，已经沐浴了两年多的弹雨，浑身嵌满了弹片，就是孤独地兀立着不倒。谁料想那烧焦的躯体上还能生出一束枫叶！
    战争要扼杀的是生命，但最不能扼杀的还是生命。这枫叶像一团从枯树重重年轮里涌出的鲜血，宣告着生命的强悍。从此，许多战士都涌到观察镜上向那丛枫叶瞭望。一次次夜战后，生还的战士都要透过望远镜送去黎明的问候。但是，每次出击都有人不能归来，而每天望枫叶的时候，又少了许多双年轻的眼睛。当我最后一次眺望时，它像火一样，从战坑累累的背景放射着光芒，传递着一闪一闪的喊声。
    一天，一位来阵地演出的女文工团员正从它身旁经过，带路的通讯员从烧焦的树杈上为她采下了那束枫叶。人们说那女文工团员已经十九岁，是通讯员崇拜的女神。但是战士们还是向天空鸣放数枪，对生命的杀戕者执行自己的意志。从此，我再来向黎明的战场瞭望，我只愿在心中留下灼痛的烙痕。
    停战后，我与那位十九岁的女文工团员都走出了这座死亡的山岗，而通讯员和许多年轻战士永远留给了那棵烧焦的枫树。
    多少年后，我从唐山大地震的废墟中发现了一本战地日记，枯黄的纸页中还珍藏着一束彤红的九裂枫……
    这是九裂枫，这是一个故事。
