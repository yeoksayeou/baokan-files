    A newly constructed sulfuric acid plant in Fúlí Town, Suzhou County, releases a large amount of toxic and foul-smelling gases daily, severely affecting the lives of nearly 500 households nearby. The factory's emissions have killed hundreds of acres of wheat surrounding the plant, and even apple orchards over a thousand meters away have been affected, with trees failing to bloom due to the toxic gases. The plant's wastewater has polluted nearby rivers, resulting in the death of fish and shrimp for tens of miles downstream. We urge relevant authorities to address and resolve the pollution issues at the Suzhou sulfuric acid plant.

    宿县硫酸厂废气污染严重
    我县符离镇东一个新建的硫酸厂，每天排出大量毒气和臭气，附近的五百户居民深受其害。这个工厂四周的几百亩小麦已被废气熏死，连离厂一千多米外的苹果园也因毒气污染，果树不开花。厂里排出的污水污染了河流，几十里内鱼虾已死绝。呼吁有关部门处理好宿县硫酸厂的污染问题。
