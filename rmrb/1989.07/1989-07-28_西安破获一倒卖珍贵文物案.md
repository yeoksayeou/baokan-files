Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 27th.

A division of the Xi'an Municipal Public Security Bureau, which had previously solved the case of the theft of a general's head from the Terracotta Army of Emperor Qin Shihuang and was awarded a collective first-class merit citation, has recently successfully cracked another case involving the long-distance trafficking of cultural relics. In late June, Zhang Jingpu and Sun Wujun, both unemployed residents of Houma City in Shanxi Province, along with Liu Xinsheng, the owner of the New World Dance Hall in Houma, rented a car to come to Xi'an to sell cultural relics. On the 23rd, just as they were concluding a deal worth 254,000 yuan in the Hujiatang area of Xi'an, police apprehended the four suspects and seized six bronze bells and chimes from the Western Zhou period, varying in size, as well as one double-barrel and one single-barrel hunting rifle, and other weapons such as daggers and bullets. Experts from the cultural relics department have appraised the set of chimes as a second-class national treasure.
