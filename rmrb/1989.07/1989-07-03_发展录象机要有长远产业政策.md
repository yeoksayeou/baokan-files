The heat of color TVs has yet to subside, and the craze for VCRs is quietly rising. As a major industry in the electronics sector, how can we avoid a rush to enter the market and repeat the mistakes of color TV production? Relevant experts suggest—

Developing VCRs Requires Long-Term Industrial Policies

By Cui Xiuzhi, People's Daily

Since June of last year, the sales volume of VCRs in our country has reached the level of the demand projected for two years later. Behind the hot sales of VCRs, there are worrying phenomena: In 1988, 1.3 million VCRs entered the domestic market, of which over 1 million were smuggled in, causing the state to lose tens of billions in tax revenue. Blindly setting up and repeatedly introducing dozens of low-level assembly production lines has led to an oversupply of simple assembly production capacity. Relevant experts believe that the VCR industry is heading down the same path as the color TV industry did years ago.

The VCR Craze Quietly Rises

The heat of color TVs has yet to subside, and the craze for VCRs is quietly rising. Last year, as the price index rose, the domestic VCR market, which had just emerged, began to heat up. Some families that had already purchased color TVs, refrigerators, and tape recorders spent their savings to rush to buy VCRs, which have a low usage rate, as a means of preserving value.

As VCRs became popular, many state-owned and collective stores and companies rushed to enter the market, and individuals with the means did not miss this opportunity to make money. The VCR market saw a situation of "many sales points, strong sales momentum, and high prices," with the price of each VCR rising by thousands of yuan. It is understood that Shanghai had more than 100 sales outlets for VCRs last year, with a sales volume of about 100,000 units, and the household ownership rate rose to 8-9%; a private entrepreneur in Dalian sold more than 20,000 VCRs last year.

Macro Control Failure and Industry Management Chaos

A few years ago, the state formulated a policy for the planned development of VCR production and clearly designated nine domestic enterprises as key producers. However, these key enterprises could not produce many products. It is understood that the domestic VCR industry has had a difficult start. Over the past decade, key enterprises have been constrained by various conditions, and the VCR industry has struggled alone, with slow progress in domestication. Currently, most key enterprises lack the capacity for mass production and matching, and are still at the level of assembling individual components. According to regulations, the tariffs for imported complete machines and full sets of components are high, and after tax, the selling price of each assembled product is over 5,000 yuan, losing competitiveness with smuggled goods on the market. Enterprises have no profits and lose the motivation to produce. Last year, the state planned to produce 44,000 units but only completed 37,000 units.

Key enterprises cannot afford to take the right path, while non-key enterprises are making a fortune through illegal means. The VCR market is dominated by smuggled and assembled goods and second-hand goods. Relevant departments believe that the tariffs set by the state, due to the lack of coordinated policies, can only control the key enterprises that abide by the law. The result is that the regular forces give way to the irregular ones, making the development of the VCR industry even more difficult. "Speculators" and those who assemble and smuggle goods make huge profits. According to the manager of a company in Dalian, last August and September, there were several batches of people coming to sell VCR components every day. One person could even provide 100,000 sets of components, exceeding the state's annual planned import volume by 1.5 times. It is understood that these smuggled goods are sometimes disassembled into several parts overseas and then reassembled and sold after being smuggled in batches. Some components are mixed with other electronic parts to evade tariffs. In just the first half of last year, illegal imports of V

    发展录象机要有长远产业政策
    本报记者　崔秀芝
    去年6月以来，我国录象机市场的销售量，达到了两年后预计需求量的水平。在录象机热销的背后，隐藏着令人担忧的现象：1988年流入国内市场的录象机达130万台，其中走私进口逾百万台，国家损失税收数十亿元；盲目上马、重复引进几十条低水平组装生产线，造成简单组装生产能力过剩。有关人士认为，录象机行业正在走上当年彩电一哄而上的老路。
    录像机热悄然而至
    彩电热温度未降，录象机热又悄然而至。去年下半年，随着物价指数上升，国内刚刚冒头的录象机市场热了起来。一些已经购买了彩电、冰箱、录音机等家用电器的家庭，不惜拿出多年积蓄，纷纷抢购使用率不高的录象机，作为保值的主要商品。
    录象机走俏，一些国营、集体商店和公司一哄而上，有实力的个体户更不放过这种发财的机会。录象机市场出现了“网点多、销势旺、价格高”的局面，录象机每台售价一度上涨千元。据了解，上海市去年销售录象机的网点有100多家，销量约10万台，家庭拥有率上升到8—9％；大连市的一个个体户，去年销出录象机2万多台。
    宏观失控　行业管理混乱
    几年前，国家就制定了有计划发展录象机生产的政策，并且明确了国内9家定点企业。可是这些定点厂却拿不出多少产品来。据了解，国产录象机工业起步艰难。10年来，定点企业受多方面条件制约，录象机工业孤军奋斗，国产化进展缓慢。目前，大多定点企业不具备批量生产和配套能力，仍停留在散件组装水平上。按规定，进口整机和全套散件的关税较高，组装产品交税后，每台售价要达5000元以上，与市场上的水货相比，失去竞争力，企业没有效益，也失去生产积极性。去年国家计划下达4.4万台，实际仅完成3.7万台。
    定点企业走正道干不下去，非定点企业的邪门歪道却搞得热火，录象机市场被走私组装的杂牌货和二水货所占领。有关部门认为，国家规定的关税，由于政策不配套，能卡得住的仅是遵纪守法的定点企业。其结果是：正规军让路给杂牌兵，录象机行业发展更加艰难，“倒爷”和组装走私货者牟取暴利。据大连市一家公司经理反映，去年八九月份，每天都有几批上门推销录象机散件的人。其中，有1人居然可提供10万套散件，超过国家全年计划进口数量的1倍半。据了解，这些走私货，有的在海外把整机拆成几块，分批分头入境后再组装销售；有的将散件混在其它电子元件中，逃避关税。仅去年上半年，非法进口录象机，就使国家损失税收10亿元。
    市场上销售的各种牌号录象机中，有许多是一些根本不具备生产条件的乡镇企业或个体户组装出来的。他们在没有技术人员、设备和测试手段的情况下，拼凑起几张桌子，铺上几张报纸就干了起来。组装的劣质录象机，只要插到电视机上有图像，就能抛向市场牟取高利。
    组装走私录象机散件成本低、赚头大，引起许多企业的兴趣。他们不顾国家利益与规定，盲目引进低水平生产线，使国内组装生产录象机的能力相对过剩，给国家造成浪费。据反映，重复引进的几十条组装生产线要靠外汇度日。
    加强管理　促进行业发展
    录象机是投资密集型和技术密集型产品，生产难度较大。它的开发和形成生产能力，不仅要有雄厚的资金和技术力量，还需要有许多配套厂的同步协作。有关人士认为，国家对录像机工业的发展要有长远的产业政策，统一规划，合理安排，才有利于民族工业协调发展。按照国际消费类电子产品规律，日本从1976年到1986年10年间，录象机生产增长100多倍，达3000多万台。录象机的产值、产量和出口量都超过彩电，创汇达数十亿美元，被誉为“美元箱”。
    我国的录象机也是继彩电之后，电子工业消费产品的第二大支柱，它可以带动基础产品向高技术发展。然而，这一切并未引起有关方面足够的重视。宏观失控，行业发展缺少统筹规划，市场混乱，国内倒买倒卖的人发了横财，国外一些老板和中间商也成了暴发户。据海外报纸报道，亚洲某大公司声称，他们去年拿到80万套录象机大散件的中国订单。与其让大量美元落入这些人的腰包，不如用这些外汇来支持民族工业的发展，对录象机定点企业多给点优惠政策，减免定点企业的整套散件进口税，扶持录象机行业尽快走上正轨，让定点企业有利可图，积累自我发展能力。
