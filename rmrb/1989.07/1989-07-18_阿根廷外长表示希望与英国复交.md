Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo said in an interview with the British newspaper "The Independent" on July 17 that Argentina hopes to normalize relations with Britain as soon as possible.

Cavallo said that Argentina is "prepared to remove all obstacles to the resumption of diplomatic relations between the two countries."

Argentine President Carlos Menem has repeatedly called for the resumption of negotiations to normalize relations between the two countries without discussing the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands.

Cavallo said: "We are prepared to declare the official end of the state of hostility, but we hope that the complete restoration of diplomatic relations also means the elimination of Britain's distrust of Argentina."

Argentina is concerned that continued deterioration of relations with Britain will be detrimental to its relations with the European Community. However, it is reported that there are also differences within the Argentine government, with some officials believing that Argentina should continue to pressure Britain diplomatically to emphasize the existence of the Falkland Islands sovereignty issue.

    阿根廷外长表示希望与英国复交
    新华社伦敦7月17日电　据英国《独立报》17日报道，阿根廷外长多明戈·卡瓦略在接受该报记者采访时说，阿根廷希望尽快实现与英国关系正常化。
    卡瓦略说，阿根廷“准备清除阻碍两国恢复外交关系的所有障碍”。
    阿根廷新总统梅内姆也一再呼吁，在不讨论马岛主权的条件下恢复两国关系正常化的谈判。
    卡瓦略说：“我们准备宣布正式结束敌对状态，但我们希望完全恢复邦交还意味着消除英国对阿根廷的不信任态度。”
    阿根廷担心同英国的关系继续恶化将不利于它同欧共体的关系。但是据报道，阿根廷政府内部也存在分歧，一些政府官员认为，阿根廷应继续在外交上压倒英国，以表明马岛主权问题依然存在。
