The Longnan region of Gansu Province administers 9 counties and 244 townships, most of which are mountainous with deep valleys and poor transportation. The land is scarce and infertile. By 1985, there were 275,000 households with an annual per capita income of less than 150 yuan, accounting for 62.5% of the total rural households. Over the years, the local party committees and governments at various levels have explored and established the "Four Ones" approach to poverty alleviation, achieving remarkable results.

The "Four Ones": One person with one mu of basic farmland, one household with one mu of orchard, one household selling one head of livestock per year, and one household sending or transferring one labor force.

This slogan first appeared in Xihe County three years ago. We still saw the original slogan on the walls along the way: "One person with one reliable mu of farmland, one household with one mu of subsidiary garden, one family selling one head of livestock, and one person going out to earn money." Later, after summarization and promotion by higher authorities, it became the current "Four Ones."

Over the past three years, the Longnan region has promoted this method, initially improving agricultural production conditions and increasing the income of the people. Specifically, the following aspects have been achieved:

- The total output value of the 9 counties and 2.3 million people increased from 518 million yuan in 1985 to 740 million yuan, a growth of 43%. The total grain production increased by 7.6%, reaching 274 kilograms per person.
- The poverty-stricken area has gradually shrunk, and the net income of farmers increased from 193 yuan in 1985 to 304 yuan, a growth of 57.5%, reducing the poverty-stricken area by 21%.
- About 25% to 30% of the households have a relatively comfortable or relatively affluent life.
- The region has transferred 160,000 laborers through various channels, with 150,000 households basically achieving the goal of sending one labor force per household, with an average annual income of nearly 400 yuan per labor force.

The "Four Ones" are practical and feasible, but their implementation requires the hard work, perseverance, and strong support of leaders at all levels.

The implementation of the "Four Ones" strategy in various counties in Longnan has its own characteristics.

Adapting to local conditions and leveraging strengths while avoiding weaknesses is a practical and effective path to poverty alleviation in mountainous areas.

There is a local saying: "The water flows clear and gentle, the white clouds wrap around the mountains. People can talk across the mountains, but it takes half a day to meet." "The mountains are rocky, standing in the clouds. The land is like a lying cow, hanging on the mountainside."

The natural conditions in the mountains are indeed harsh. Soil erosion covers 57% of the area, with an average of 160 million tons of soil and sand lost annually, making it one of the four key areas for debris flows in the country. More than 90% of the arable land is mountainous, generally with a slope of 15 degrees or more, known as "hanging fields," "lying cow fields," and "three-run fields" (water, fertilizer, and soil run off). In the region, 34% of the villages do not have access roads, and 20% of the townships and 48% of the villages do not have electricity. Along the 460-kilometer road, there are 892 debris flow gullies.

However, there are also many favorable conditions. The climate is relatively mild (transitioning from subtropical to warm temperate), and the underground water resources are abundant. The people are hardworking and have a strong work ethic. Under these circumstances, the region promptly adopted and promoted the policy of "who manages, who is responsible, who plants, who harvests." At the same time, they adapted to local conditions and leveraged their own advantages without imposing uniformity. They clearly defined the focus of treatment: in river valleys and plains, they focused on transforming low-yield fields and low-lying lands; in semi-mountainous dry areas, they built terraced fields to conserve soil and water; in high-altitude and humid areas, they built irrigation channels and terraced fields. The region also adopted economic incentives to encourage people to build fields and divert water. Now, the total area of basic farmland has reached 1.78 million mu, with an average of 0.85 mu per person. The irrigated area has reached more than 380,000 mu, with an average of 0.61 mu per household.

In the construction of orchards, the policy of "government subsidies for seedlings, farmers' labor, collective planting, and ownership by the planter" was adopted. After more than three years of effort, citrus was developed along the Bailong River and Baishui River, pepper was developed in the Wei River basin, apples were developed in Lixian County, and wood ear, lacquer, and walnuts were developed in Kang County and Wudu County, initially forming small economic zones and flagship products.

Leaders pay attention, take the lead, and take responsibility for specific tasks and areas. The Longnan region includes poverty alleviation work as part of the assessment of officials at all levels. Last year alone, 470 officials at the regional and county levels were assigned to 948 poverty alleviation points. The regional party secretary, Zhang Xuezhong, took responsibility for Yongning and Mazhuan townships in Huixian County. Through the construction of terraced fields and scientific farming, Yongning Township's per capita grain production reached over 900 kilograms last year. Mazhuan Township, after three years of hard work, exceeded 304 kilograms per person.

The leadership pays attention to the harsh natural conditions and advocates a spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In addition to regular meetings, leaders work on-site, conduct investigations and research on the spot, and solve problems on the spot. We found that the regional and county officials are very familiar with the situation of each township and village, have close relationships with the people, and some comrades deeply felt that they saw the spirit of the old Eighth Route Army here.

They mobilized social forces to actively participate in poverty alleviation. They adopted the leadership method of "strengthening the county level, reinforcing the township level, and extending to the village level" to mobilize various departments, sectors, and people from all walks of life to actively participate in poverty alleviation work. The military region and the people's armed forces took responsibility for 1,299 households; the science and technology department implemented 152 scientific and technological projects, developed 9,078 scientific and technological demonstration households, and established 92 agricultural technology research associations; the commercial department took responsibility for 85 management points and assisted 176 township enterprises. Additionally, they adopted the form of public-private partnership, raised 11.5 million yuan, built 29 markets, and formed 21 specialized markets.

The significance of the "Four Ones" and its enlightenment for us

The investigation made us realize:

The "Four Ones" essentially aim to develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production on the basis of increasing grain production, providing a relatively reliable path to prosperity for the people in mountainous areas. In the current situation where the national finances are still facing difficulties, the "Four Ones" is an effective measure to develop agricultural production with minimal investment. The "Four Ones" is also a relatively stable method to implement the poverty alleviation program. Some other places in the country set the poverty line at 150 yuan and the standard for the poverty alleviation program at 200 kilograms of grain, which is neither very practical nor scientific and is very unstable, easily affected by price fluctuations or disasters. "This year's harvest brings poverty alleviation; next year's disaster brings poverty again." Longnan's "Four Ones" is more in line with the reality of mountainous areas, achieving stable poverty alleviation.

In the process of leading farmers out of poverty and into prosperity, the Longnan region resolutely adjusted the paralyzed and ineffective township governments, promptly reorganized the seriously disconnected and irresponsible leadership teams, and severely dealt with those who committed serious violations of law and discipline for personal gain. At the same time, they sent capable cadres to strengthen, enrich, and improve the township governments. The people happily said, "Helping with money and materials is not as good as helping with a good party branch," which is the fundamental guarantee for the realization of the "Four Ones."

    切合实际  便于施行  易见成效
    ——陇南地区“四个一”扶贫战略简记
    何载
    甘肃陇南地区，辖9县244个乡镇，多数地方山大沟深，交通不便，地少瘠薄。至1985年，全区人均纯收入在150元以下的贫困户有27.5万户，占总农户的62.5％。多年来，这里的各级党委和政府，经过多方实践和探索，确立了“四个一”的扶贫工作路子，取得了明显的成效。
    “四个一”：一人一亩基本田，一户一亩林果园，一户一年出售一头商品畜，一户输出或转移一个劳动力
    这个口号3年前首先出现在西和县。我们在沿途的墙上还看到最初的标语是：“一人一亩可靠田，一户一亩副业园，一家要卖一头畜，一户一人去挣钱”。以后经上级归纳和推广，才成为现在的“四个一”。
    3年来，陇南地区推广这个办法，初步改善了农业生产条件，增加了群众收入。具体表现在以下方面：
    ——全区9县230万人，总产值由1985年的5.18亿元增加到7.4亿元，增长43％。粮食总产量增长7.6％，人均达到274公斤。
    ——贫困面逐渐缩小，农民纯收入由1985年的193元增加到304元，增长57.5％，贫困面下降了21％。
    ——约有25％—30％的农户生活比较宽余或比较富裕了。
    ——全区通过各种渠道输出和转移劳力16万多人，其中15万农户基本实现了每户输出一个劳动力，平均每个劳动力年收入近400元。
    “四个一”切实可行，但实施中离不开各级领导吃苦耐劳、艰苦奋斗和各方面大力支持
    陇南各县实施“四个一”战略颇具特点。
    因地制宜，扬长避短，是一条在山区切实可行的脱贫致富的路子。
    当地流传这样的顺口溜：“流水清潺潺，白云绕山间。隔山能说话，相见得半天。”“山是石头山，插在云里边。地是卧牛田，挂在半山间。”
    山区自然条件确实严峻。水土流失面积占57％，每年平均流失泥沙1.6亿吨，是全国4个泥石流重点地区之一。90％以上耕地是山地，一般都在15度或20度以上，群众叫“挂田”、“卧牛田”、“三跑田”（跑水、跑肥、跑土）。全区有34％的村不通大路，还有20％的乡、48％的村不通电。全区460公里的路段上就有892处泥石流沟。
    但有利条件也很多，气候较温和（亚热带向温暖带过渡阶段），地下水的资源相当丰富。群众很能吃苦耐劳，干劲大。在这种情况下，地区及时采纳和推广了“谁治、谁管、谁种、谁收”的政策，同时，因地制宜，发挥各自优势，不强求一律。他们明确治理的重点，在河谷川坝重点改造低产田和低洼地；半山干旱地大力修水平梯田，保土保墒；高寒阴湿地方则修渠帮堰，排石整地。地区还采取经济优惠办法鼓励群众修田、引水。现在，全区的基本田已达到178万亩，人均达到0.85亩。灌溉面积达到38万多亩，户均0.61亩。
    在建设林果园上，采用“公家补助树苗，农民投劳，连片栽种，谁栽谁有”的政策。经过3年多的努力，在白龙江和白水江沿岸重点发展柑桔，在西汉水流域重点发展花椒，在礼县重点发展苹果，在康县、武都重点发展木耳、油漆、核桃，初步形成了一种小经济区和拳头产品。
    领导重视，亲自动手，包点办点，包片治片。陇南地区把扶贫工作作为考核各级干部的内容之一。仅地、县两级，去年就抽出470名干部包948个扶贫点。地委书记张学忠包了徽县的永宁、麻沿两个乡。通过修建水平田和科学种田，永宁乡去年人均粮食已达900多公斤。麻沿乡苦战3年，人均超过304公斤。
    领导机关针对十分困难的自然条件，大力提倡艰苦奋斗的作风，注重身体力行。除了定期的会议外，领导干部都在现场办公，就地调查研究问题，就地解决问题。我们接触当中感到地县干部对每个乡、每个村的情况都很了解，很熟悉，和群众关系很密切，一些同志深有感触地说，在这儿“看到了老八路作风”。
    广泛动员社会力量积极扶贫。他们本着“提高县一级、强化乡一级，延伸村一级”的领导方法，广泛动员各部门、各方面、各阶层人士积极参加扶贫工作。军分区和人武部门包了1299户；科技部门实施科技项目152项，发展科技示范户9078户，建立了农业技术研究会92个；工商部门包85个管理点，扶助176个乡镇企业……另外，采取民办公助形式，集资1150万元，修建29个市场，形成了21个专业市场。
    “四个一”的意义所在和对我们的启发
    调查使我们认识到：
    “四个一”实质上是在增粮基础上使农林牧副全面发展，使山区人民致富的一条比较可靠的道路。在当前国家财政尚有困难的情况下，“四个一”是实现发展农业生产一条投资少的有效措施。“四个一”也是实施温饱工程比较稳妥的办法。全国其他一些地方规定以150元作为脱贫界限，以200公斤口粮作为温饱工程的标准，既不很切合实际，又不够科学，也很不稳定，容易受到物价或灾害的冲击。“今年丰收，进入脱贫行列；明年遭灾，又陷入贫困队伍”。陇南的“四个一”则较切合山区实际，实现稳步脱贫。
    在领导农民脱贫致富过程中，陇南地区对于瘫痪的和不起作用的乡政权，坚决进行了调整，对严重脱离群众、不负责任的班子及时改组，对于贪赃枉法、以权谋私的严重违法乱纪分子严肃处理。同时又派得力干部去加强、充实、改进了乡政权。群众高兴地说“帮钱帮物不如帮个好支部”，这是“四个一”得以实现的根本保证。
