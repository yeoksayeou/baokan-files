Starting from July 1, the Ministry of Communications has made new adjustments to the schedules of international regular shipping services. There are now 133 new routes, an increase of 18 compared to last year. Among these, 41 are core routes, an increase of 8 compared to last year.

To meet the needs of the continuously developing foreign trade, the Ministry of Communications decided in 1986 to allocate some of the berths from the busy coastal ports for fixed berths for international regular shipping services, organizing a fleet of international regular shipping services primarily led by COSCO. Over the past few years, with efforts from all sides, a certain scale of international regular shipping routes has been developed.

According to the requirements of "five fixed" (fixed time, fixed route, fixed berth, fixed vessel, fixed cargo type), each port prioritizes the organization and ensures the loading and unloading of goods. Currently, 15 ports have opened international regular shipping services.

    我国际定期轮运发展快
    班轮班期有新调整
    本报北京7月9日讯　从7月1日起，交通部对国际定期班轮班期作了新的调整，新调航班为133个，比上年增加18个。其中，核心班轮为41个航班，比上年增加8个航班。
    为适应对外贸易不断发展的需要，1986年起，交通部决定从沿海紧张的码头泊位中拿出一些做国际定期班轮固定泊位，组织以中远公司为主干的国际班轮运输船队。几年来在各方面的努力下，现已发展成一定规模的国际班轮航线。
    根据班轮“五定”（定时间、定航线、定泊位、定船舶、定货种）要求，各港口在装卸货物上优先组织，优先保证。目前，已开办国际班轮业务的有15个港口。　（王金文）
