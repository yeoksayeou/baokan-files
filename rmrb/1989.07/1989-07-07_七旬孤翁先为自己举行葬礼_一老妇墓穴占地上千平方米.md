A 70-year-old widower holds his own funeral; a widow's grave occupies over a thousand square meters

On the afternoon of April 19, in a courtyard of Yangmei Village, Dongyue Temple Township, in our county, mournful music filled the air, and firecrackers exploded in succession. In front of the house, 14 tables were set for a banquet, and guests raised their glasses and drank freely, showing no signs of sorrow. Inside the main hall, a solemn-looking old man sat on a platform. At his feet, three pairs of children dressed in mourning clothes knelt. On the left side of the hall, six Daoist priests in ceremonial robes were chanting scriptures loudly.

It turned out that this was a funeral for a living person. The old man sitting on the platform was named Yang Wanglao, aged 73, and living alone. He was worried that his funeral would be cold and lonely, making it difficult for him to enter the "gates of the underworld," so he used the 1,000 yuan he had saved to invite Daoist priests and "mourners" to hold the funeral in advance. Each mourner was paid 5 yuan per day. He also prepared food and drinks to entertain over 100 acquaintances and friends who came to "pay their respects."

In our county of Shengwan, where per capita arable land is relatively scarce, a strange incident recently occurred: the grave of an elderly woman, Madame Fan, in Qizhanling Village, occupies an area of 1,053 square meters, equivalent to the responsibility fields of two people.

Madame Fan had seven sons. One son went to college, and the others went out to do business and made a lot of money. After Madame Fan passed away on March 14 this year, her descendants took the opportunity to build extensively, spending a large sum of money to buy a tombstone from outside the county, measuring 4.17 meters high and 1.91 meters wide, and placing it in front of the grave; on both sides of the tombstone, there are a pair of finely carved stone lions; in front of the tombstone, there is a table 1.47 meters long, and near the table, there is a worship platform, forming a spacious small square; behind the grave, there is an artificial hill made of 72 cubic meters of earth. To build this grave and the surrounding facilities, the owner also specially built a temporary road 850 meters long and 2.5 meters wide.

    七旬孤翁先为自己举行葬礼  一老妇墓穴占地上千平方米
    4月19日中午，我县东岳庙乡杨梅村一户农家院里，哀乐声声，鞭炮阵阵；房前设有14桌酒宴，宾客们举杯换盏，开怀畅饮，不见丝毫悲伤。这家农户堂屋中间设一灵台，台前坐着一位神态庄重的老翁。老翁脚下跪伏着3对身着孝服的童男童女；堂屋左侧是6位身穿法衣的道士，正在高声念诵经文。
    原来这是一场为活人举行的葬礼。灵台前端坐的那位老翁名叫杨王佬，今年73岁，孤身一人。他担心死后葬礼冷清，难入“阴府豪门”，故用平时积攒的1000多元钱请来了道士、“孝子”，提前举行葬礼。哭灵的每人每天5元工钱。他还备了酒菜，宴请100多名前来“吊唁”的乡亲故友。湖南汉寿县公安局　文者
    在人均耕地较少的我县盛湾乡，近日出现一件怪事：旗杆岭村一老妇范氏去世后，墓穴占地竟达1053平方米，相当于两个人的责任田。
    范氏有7个儿子，一个儿子上大学，其他的外出做生意赚了大钱。今年3月14日，范氏去世后，儿孙们便借机大兴土木，花巨款从外地购回一块高4.17米，宽1.91米的墓碑，立在墓前；墓碑两旁还立着一对雕刻精细的石狮子；碑前是一张长1.47米的供桌，供桌附近设有拜台，形成一个宽阔的小广场；墓后筑有72立方米土组成的人工假山。为修建此墓及周围设施，主人还专门筑了一条长850米，宽2.5米的临时公路。
