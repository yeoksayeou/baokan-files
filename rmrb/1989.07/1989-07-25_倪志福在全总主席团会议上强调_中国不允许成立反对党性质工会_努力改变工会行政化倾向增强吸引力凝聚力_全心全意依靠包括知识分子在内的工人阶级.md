Nie Rongzhen, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU), stated today at the expanded meeting of the 11th National Congress of the ACFTU Chairman's Council: "In China, we absolutely will not allow the establishment of trade unions with an opposition party nature. Any attempt to break away from the Party's leadership and lead the trade unions towards a 'political opposition' is something we must resolutely oppose." The main agenda of this meeting is to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Deng Xiaoping's recent important speeches, and to research and deploy several key tasks for the trade unions.

Nie Rongzhen said, during the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, China's working class has undergone a severe test and played a pivotal role. The vast majority of workers across the country have stood firm, held high the banner, resolutely supported the Party's leadership, and resolutely defended the socialist system, making significant contributions to stopping the turmoil and suppressing the rebellion.

Nie Rongzhen said, the trade unions must maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee and work under the Party's leadership; otherwise, they will make serious mistakes. At the same time, they must, according to the nature and characteristics of the trade unions, independently and autonomously carry out work, actively and steadily promote the reform of the trade unions themselves, strive to change the administrative tendency of the trade unions, and truly transform the leadership style and activities, continuously enhancing the trade unions' ability to attract and unite the workers, and winning the high trust of the worker masses. Otherwise, we will lose the masses and leave an opportunity for those who want to establish "independent trade unions" to exploit, and we will also make serious mistakes.

When talking about relying wholeheartedly on the working class, Nie Rongzhen said, Jiang Zemin recently pointed out that we must rely wholeheartedly on the working class. Without their enthusiasm, creativity, and sense of responsibility as masters, nothing can be achieved. This is an absolute truth. Relying on the working class, of course, also includes relying on the broad intellectuals as part of the working class. They are the most important component of the working class with the highest level of knowledge, not only shouldering the heavy responsibility of building the four modernizations but also the heavy responsibility of the intellectualization of the working class. Their labor and creation should be fully respected. However, in recent years, some people have tried to "downgrade" the working class, and even mentioning the leading role of the working class has become a problem. Especially for the large and medium-sized enterprises, which are the pillars of the national economy, the industrial workers who create the most material wealth for society, have not received the attention they deserve, seriously dampening the enthusiasm of the worker masses. The worker masses are very dissatisfied with this.

Nie Rongzhen proposed several key tasks for the current trade union work: First, mobilize the broad masses of workers to achieve a complete victory in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the rebellion; second, carry out in-depth production and cost-saving, income and expenditure-saving movements to make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and rebellion; third, carry out basic line education and master spirit education, strengthen the ideological and political work of the workers; fourth, care for the life of the workers, do practical things, and safeguard the legal rights and interests of the workers; fifth, in promoting democracy and combating corruption, better play the supervisory role of the trade unions; sixth, continue to implement the spirit of the 11th National Congress of the Trade Unions, and actively and steadily promote the reform of the trade unions.

    倪志福在全总主席团会议上强调
    中国不允许成立反对党性质工会
    努力改变工会行政化倾向增强吸引力凝聚力
    全心全意依靠包括知识分子在内的工人阶级
    本报北京7月25日讯　记者张国荣报道：“在中国，决不允许成立具有反对党性质的工会。任何企图摆脱党的领导，把工会引向‘政治反对派’的图谋，我们都必须旗帜鲜明地与之斗争。”这是全国总工会主席倪志福今天在全总十一届三次主席团扩大会上说的。这次会议的主要议题是认真学习贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志最近的几次重要讲话，研究部署工会需要着力抓好的几项工作。
    倪志福说，在这次发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中，我国工人阶级经受了严峻考验，起到了中流砥柱的作用。全国广大职工立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，坚决拥护党的领导，坚决捍卫社会主义制度，为制止动乱、平息暴乱做出了重大的贡献。
    倪志福说，工会必须与党中央保持一致，必须在党的领导下进行工作，否则将会犯极大的错误。同时，又必须按照工会的性质和特点，独立自主地开展工作，积极稳妥地推进工会自身改革，努力改变工会的行政化倾向，切实转变领导作风和活动方式，不断增强工会组织对职工的吸引力和凝聚力，赢得职工群众的高度信任。否则，我们将丧失群众，给搞“独立工会”的人留下可乘之隙，也将犯极大的错误。
    在谈到全心全意依靠工人阶级时，倪志福说，江泽民同志最近指出，必须全心全意依靠工人阶级，离开了他们的积极性、创造性和主人翁责任感，一切都无从谈起。这是千真万确的真理。依靠工人阶级，当然也包括依靠作为工人阶级一部分的广大知识分子。他们是工人阶级队伍中知识水平最高的重要组成部分，不仅担负着建设四化的重任，而且担负着工人阶级知识化的重任。他们的劳动和创造，理应受到充分的尊重。但是，近几年来有人却要“淡化”工人阶级，甚至连提工人阶级的主力军作用都成为问题。尤其是作为国民经济支柱的大中型企业，创造社会物质财富最多的产业工人，没有受到应有的重视，严重地挫伤了职工群众的积极性。对此，职工群众是很不满意的。
    倪志福提出当前工会工作要抓的几件事情：一、动员广大职工，夺取制止动乱、平息暴乱斗争的彻底胜利；二、深入开展增产节约、增收节支运动，把动乱和暴乱造成的损失夺回来；三、开展基本路线教育和主人翁精神教育，加强职工思想政治工作；四、关心职工生活，办好实事，维护职工的合法权益；五、在促进民主和惩治腐败中，更好地发挥工会的监督作用；六、继续贯彻工会十一大精神，积极稳妥地推进工会改革。
