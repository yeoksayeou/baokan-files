Last June, a rare large-scale landslide occurred in a certain area of our province. Over 60,000 cubic meters of mud and rocks instantly buried a village at the foot of the mountain, causing immense disaster to both the nation and the people. The flood season is upon us this year. It is suggested that relevant departments in various regions, in addition to focusing on monitoring slopes, should also keep abreast of local weather changes, drain accumulated water from dangerous slopes, and prevent large amounts of water from seeping into the slopes. This will help in preventing landslides and reducing the damage caused by them.

It is understood that there are many factors that cause landslides, among which water is a significant external factor. Water has the effects of erosion, dissolution, and scouring on slopes, reducing the resistance of rocks and red soil to shear failure by 30% to 60% or more. In recent years, due to excessive logging, the ecological environment has been destroyed, exacerbating the erosion of soil by rainwater. Studies have shown that more than 90% of landslides and collapses are related to rainfall, and there is a slightly delayed correlation between the occurrence of landslides and the timing of heavy rainfall. The greater the rainfall, the more unstable the slope areas become, and once the soil layer starts to slide, it leads to landslides and collapses. The saying among the people, "Heavy rain causes heavy slides, light rain causes light slides, and no rain causes no slides," is based on this principle.

However, under the same amount of rainfall, continuous stable rain is more likely to cause landslides than intermittent rain. This is because intermittent rain has a short duration and high intensity, easily causing surface runoff, and thus less soil infiltration. Continuous stable rain, on the other hand, has a longer duration, lower intensity, and less surface runoff, so more rainwater seeps into the soil. During prolonged rainy days, attention should be paid to the possibility of landslides.

Additionally, thunderstorm vibrations and freeze-thaw effects can also promote landslides. Due to natural weathering, rain erosion, or human activities, loose rocks formed on the surface in summer are highly susceptible to collapse during strong thunderstorm vibrations. In winter, the melting of the frozen layer reduces the rock's resistance to shear failure and frictional resistance, and the melting water seeping down after thawing can cause the slope to slide.

    汛期谨防山林滑坡
    去年6月，我省某地发生了罕见的山林大滑坡，6万多立方米的泥石刹时就把山脚边的村庄埋在底下，给国家和人民均造成了极大的灾难。今年汛期已至，建议各地有关部门除重点做好斜坡的监测工作外，还要及时掌握和了解当地的天气变化，排除危险斜坡内的积水，防止大量降水渗入坡内，做到预防滑坡和减少滑坡造成的损失。
    据了解，造成滑坡的因素有很多，其中水是重要外因。因水对斜坡有冲刷、溶解、侵蚀等作用，使岩石和红土的抵抗剪切破坏的能力减少30％至60％以上。同时由于近年来滥伐林木，破坏了生态环境，使雨水加剧了对泥土的侵蚀。研究表明，90％以上的滑坡、崩塌都与降雨有关，且滑坡发生的时间与降大雨时段从统计分析上存在着稍滞后的相关关系。因降雨量愈大，斜坡地带就愈趋于不稳定状态，土壤层一产生滑动就引起了滑坡和崩塌。群众中“大雨大滑，小雨小滑，无雨不滑”的说法也就是这个道理。
    但在同等降雨量下，持续稳定性降雨比阵性降雨更易产生滑坡，因为阵性降雨时间短、强度大，易发生地表泾流，土层渗透量也就小。而稳定性降雨持续时间长、强度小、地表泾流小，所以雨水下渗多。出现连续阴雨天气时，更应注意滑坡。
    另外雷电震动和冻融作用也易促进滑坡。由于自然风化，雨水冲刷或人工形成的临究石在夏季遇到强雷电震动时，也极易产生崩塌。而冬季的冰冻层融解，使岩石抵抗剪切破坏的能力和抗滑摩擦力减小，加上解冻后融化的水下渗，斜坡就会产生滑动。
