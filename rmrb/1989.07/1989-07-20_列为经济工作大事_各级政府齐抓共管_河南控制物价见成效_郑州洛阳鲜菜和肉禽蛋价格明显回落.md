The Henan provincial government has made controlling price increases a central task, fully implementing various rectification measures, and has seen success in curbing price hikes. This year, the price indices for fresh vegetables and meat, eggs, and poultry in Zhengzhou have decreased by 56% and 21.6% respectively compared to last year, making it one of the cities with the largest decreases among 35 major cities nationwide. Luoyang has also seen a decrease of 9.2 percentage points compared to last year.

At the beginning of the year, in response to the persistent high price increases, the provincial government clearly stated that the price control target should be treated as the top economic task for the entire province this year. They also included the price control target as a mandatory measure in the "Target Management Responsibility Book" signed with various regions, cities, and departments, making it a crucial part of the provincial government's performance evaluation. Additionally, a price monitoring team was established to supervise the completion of price control targets on a monthly and category basis. Warnings are issued to regions and departments that exceed the control targets, and targeted measures are proposed to further strengthen control.

Zhengzhou and Luoyang have also broken down the retail price index control targets into various relevant departments and units, which are then further broken down to grassroots units, ensuring that everyone is responsible for their respective tasks. Simultaneously, they implement a "six-pack" system for various departments and units: production departments are responsible for completing production plans; operational departments are responsible for market supply arrangements; industrial and commercial management departments are responsible for managing and rectifying agricultural markets and prices; financial departments are responsible for raising subsidy funds and adjusting working capital; price departments are responsible for implementing and supervising the price management system; and statistical departments are responsible for monitoring, predicting, and feedback on price indices. These measures have yielded certain results.

    列为经济工作大事　各级政府齐抓共管
    河南控制物价见成效
    郑州洛阳鲜菜和肉禽蛋价格明显回落
    本报郑州7月20日电　记者李杰报道：河南省各级政府以控制物价上涨为中心，全面落实各项治理整顿措施，物价涨势得到遏制。今年郑州市鲜菜和肉蛋禽的物价指数分别比去年下降了56％和21.6％，在全国35个大中城市横向对比中，下降幅度较大，洛阳市也较去年下降了9.2个百分点。
    年初，针对物价上涨居高不下的势头，省政府就明确提出，把物价控制目标，作为今年全省经济工作的第一件大事来抓。他们还把物价控制目标当作硬性措施写进了与各地、市各部门签订的《目标管理责任书》中，作为省政府目标考核的重要内容。同时，成立物价监测小组，逐月逐类对物价控制目标的完成情况进行监督，对突破控制目标的市地和部门及时报警，并有针对性地提出进一步加强控制的措施。
    郑州和洛阳两市还把零售物价指数控制目标作为指令性计划分解到各有关部门和单位，然后再由这些部门和单位
  “二次分解”到各基层单位，层层落实，各负其责。同时，他们对各部门、各单位实行
  “六包”，即生产部门包生产计划的完成；经营部门包市场供应安排；工商管理部门包农贸市场价格管理和整顿；财政金融部门包补贴资金的筹集和流动资金的调度；物价部门包完善物价管理体系和监督机制的实施；统计部门包物价指数的监控、预测和信息反馈。这些措施都收到了一定效果。
