The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied to the U.S. Embassy regarding the shooting incident involving martial law troops on July 6th in the afternoon. Assistant Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu summoned U.S. Ambassador James Lilley to hand over a reply from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the U.S. Embassy's note dated July 3rd. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note firmly rejected the U.S. Embassy's groundless accusations and strong protests regarding the shooting incident that occurred near the diplomatic compound at Jianguomen on June 7th.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' note pointed out that at 10:15 AM on June 7th, a unit of martial law troops passing near the Jianguomen overpass was attacked by gunfire from the diplomatic compound at Jianguomen and the south side of the road. Soldier Zhang Lijie was killed on the spot, and Liu Hanbin and three others were injured. The unit was forced to return fire, which was purely a self-defense action. The U.S. side, however, described this incident as "deliberate and premeditated," which is clearly a fabrication and a distortion of facts.

The note stated that the U.S. note falsely claimed, "The bullets were definitely fired from the Changfu Gong building, which was occupied by the PLA on the night of June 6th." This accusation is baseless. The fact is that the martial law troops have never been stationed in the Changfu Gong building. At the time of the shooting incident, there was not a single soldier from the martial law troops in the Changfu Gong building, making it impossible for the troops to have fired at the diplomatic compound from Changfu Gong.

The note further stated that the Chinese government has always adhered to international law and attaches great importance to the security of foreign diplomatic missions in China. The facts have proven that during the martial law period in some parts of Beijing, as long as the relevant laws and regulations of Beijing City and the martial law troops are strictly observed, the safety of foreign embassies and their staff is fully guaranteed. It is noteworthy that some people have used embassy buildings and staff residences for purposes unrelated to their diplomatic functions, even providing refuge for criminals wanted by Chinese public security authorities, which is a blatant violation of international law.

The note pointed out that the embassy's note stated that the shooting incident "may have been deliberate and premeditated," using such groundless "possibilities" for political negotiations is extremely irresponsible and unprofessional.

The note said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has begun to handle the aftermath of the above incident, and at a time when the matter is being resolved reasonably, the U.S. Embassy is creating unnecessary trouble and provoking incidents. It is particularly suspicious that the embassy submitted the matter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4 PM on July 3rd, but had already leaked the information to the media through American journalists the previous day, on July 2nd.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs solemnly declares: The U.S. Embassy's attempt to exploit this incident, which has already been resolved, to pressure the Chinese government is in vain.

    外交部就戒严部队遭枪击事件复照美驻华使馆
    断然拒绝美方的无理指责和强烈抗议
    新华社北京7月6日电　7月6日下午，中国外交部部长助理刘华秋约见了美国驻华大使李洁明，面交了中国外交部对美国驻华大使馆7月3日照会的复照。外交部的照会断然拒绝了美国大使馆就6月7日在建国门外交公寓附近发生的枪击事件对中国政府的无理指责和“强烈抗议”。
    外交部照会指出，6月7日上午10时15分，一支戒严部队路经建国门立交桥附近时，遭到来自建国门外交公寓和路南两个方向的枪击，部队战士藏立杰当场死亡，刘汉滨等3人受伤。该支部队被迫还击，这完全是自卫的行动。美方却把这件事说成是“故意的，有预谋的”，这显然是无中生有，本末倒置。
    照会说，来照妄称“子弹肯定是从6月6日晚被解放军部队占领的长富宫大厦中发射出来的”。这是毫无根据的指责。事实是，戒严部队从来就没有进驻过长富宫，发生枪击事件时，长富宫大楼内没有戒严部队的一兵一卒，根本不存在部队从长富宫向外交公寓开枪平射的可能。
    照会还说，中国政府一贯遵循国际法准则，十分重视外国驻华外交代表机构的安全保卫工作。事实证明，在北京部分地区戒严期间，只要严格遵守北京市和戒严部队的有关法令和规定，外国使馆和馆员安全是完全有保障的。值得注意的是，有人将使馆馆舍和使馆工作人员寓所充作与使馆职务不相符的用途，甚至对被中国公安机关通缉的人犯提供庇护，这才真正是对国际法准则的粗暴践踏。
    照会指出，大使馆来照说，枪击事件“很可能是故意的，有预谋的”，以这种毫无根据的“可能”来进行政治交涉是极不严肃的，不负责任的。
    照会说，中国外交部已开始对上述事件作善后处理，在事情正在得到合情合理解决的时刻，美国驻华大使馆竟然节外生枝，挑起事端。尤其不能不令人怀疑的是大使馆是在7月3日下午4时向外交部交涉的，而在前一天即7月2日就通过美国记者将此事透露出去。
    外交部郑重声明：美国驻华使馆利用这样一个本来已经得到了解决的事件大作文章，企图向中国政府施加压力，这完全是徒劳的。
