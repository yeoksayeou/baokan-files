On June 3, over 1,000 soldiers from a certain unit of the martial law troops received orders to advance to the Jian Guo Men Interchange in Beijing.

That evening at around 7 PM, the Jian Guo Men Interchange was teeming with people. The dozens of military vehicles executing the martial law mission were quickly engulfed by the surging crowd. The soldiers were blocked, separated, and surrounded, unable to regroup immediately. Amidst the chaos, some people started throwing bricks and soda bottles at the soldiers, others let the air out of the military vehicles' tires, and some even climbed onto the vehicles and tore the tarps...

It was difficult to distinguish between good and bad at that moment, and the situation was complex and urgent. What to do? At an emergency meeting convened by the troops, the officers and soldiers unanimously agreed that we must not regard emotionally agitated crowds as rioters. In situations where retaliating against rioters might injure civilians, no one was to open fire without orders from superiors.

Facing the crowd, the soldiers showed great restraint. Their backpacks and raincoats were stolen, their compressed biscuits were soaked in thermos flasks, some officers had spit on their faces, and many soldiers were beaten until they bled. But they persisted in not striking back or retaliating with words, swallowing their blood and tears, and winning the trust of the crowd with their actions, gradually calming the noisy interchange.

At 4 AM on June 4, due to the spread of rumors, the atmosphere at the Jian Guo Men Interchange became tense again. Amidst the chaos, a small group of rioters attempted to seize an ammunition truck. "We must not let the weapons fall into the hands of the rioters!" Officers and party members quickly formed a human wall around the ammunition truck, linking arms and standing shoulder to shoulder...

On June 4, the first batch of sentries from this unit marched towards the Jian Guo Men Interchange post. The soldiers first saluted the onlooking crowd with a solemn military salute, and the crowd erupted in a round of enthusiastic applause.

The sun was scorching. The sentries at the Jian Guo Men Interchange, wearing steel helmets and holding steel guns, stood tall and proud. It was here that this unit endured being besieged and trapped for 6 days and 6 nights. During the days and nights of camping at the bridgehead, the soldiers endured the scorching sun and heavy rain, went without food and water. Some companies' cooking trucks were burned, and 40-plus people had to share one cabbage to fill their stomachs; some companies went three days without salt; one company went two days without food, and the quartermaster found a sausage from somewhere, but the soldiers passed it around without anyone taking a bite. It was the company commander who ordered the sausage to be cut into over 40 pieces, with each soldier getting a piece...

One day, a few citizens found the unit commander and said, "On the night of June 3, we cursed you on the bridge. We're truly sorry!" After that, citizens on the interchange often expressed their apologies and thanks to the unit in various ways. Mr. Zhao, over 60 years old, boiled two buckets of green bean soup every noon and sent them to the bridgehead; about 10 students from Class 2, Grade 4 of Guanghua Road Primary School brought water to the on-duty sentries every day after school. They also saved their pocket money to buy watermelons for the sentries; the shuttle bus of Beijing Daily Chemical Factory No. 2 passed the interchange every day, and the workers, seeing the sentries sweating and their uniforms soaked, sent dozens of boxes of laundry detergent to the unit; every night after 9 PM, if there were crowds gathering on the bridge, nearby residents would automatically come out to maintain order and persuade people to leave...

The people's soldiers have a deep affection for the people and their property.

At dawn on June 6, the unit camping at the Jian Guo Men Interchange received an urgent order: to rush to the north entrance of He Ping Street as quickly as possible. Upon arrival, they saw that dozens of public buses had been pushed to the center of the road, filled with wreaths, and a few troublemakers were inciting thousands of uninformed crowds to gather there. The troublemakers claimed they were holding a memorial service for the "martyrs" and planned to burn dozens of public buses.

At 3:40 AM, unit commander Zhang Zuoli led the soldiers, braving the rain of bricks and soda bottles thrown at them, to disperse the uninformed crowds and quickly surround the buses and troublemakers. In the chaos, as a troublemaker lit a homemade Molotov cocktail, staff officer Gong Fushuang rushed forward and extinguished the flames with his hands. Half an hour later, 28 troublemakers were captured.

That night at around 11:30 PM, Zhang Zuoli led over 200 soldiers to run to a store surrounded by public security personnel and quickly captured 35 troublemakers attempting to loot the store, protecting the state's property.

This unit was commended by the General Staff Department of the PLA. They are truly deserving of the title "Guardians of the People," bestowed upon them by the crowd.

    人民战士的情怀
    ——戒严部队某部采访纪实
    本报记者　赖仁琼
    6月3日，戒严部队某部1000多名官兵奉命向北京建国门立交桥开进。
    当晚19时许，建国门立交桥上人流如潮。执行戒严任务的几十辆军车很快就被淹没在黑压压的人群里。官兵们被堵截、被分割、被包围，一时无法集结。在一片喧闹声中，有人开始向士兵扔砖头、汽水瓶，有人给军车的轮胎放气，还有人爬上军车撕破了篷布……
    良莠一时难以分清，情况十分复杂而危急。怎么办？在部队临时召开的紧急会议上，指战员们一致认为，我们决不能把情绪激动的群众当暴徒。在还击暴徒有可能误伤群众的情况下，没有上级的命令，一律不准开枪。
    面对人群，官兵们表现出极大的克制力。他们的背包、雨衣被抢，压缩饼干被人放进保温桶里泡了汤，有的军官被人吐了一脸唾沫，还有不少士兵被打得头破血流。但他们坚持打不还手，骂不还口，让血水和泪水一齐往肚里咽，硬是用事实赢得了群众的信任，使人声鼎沸的立交桥逐渐平静下来。
    4日凌晨，由于传闻四起，建国门立交桥的气氛再次紧张。混乱之中，一小撮暴徒妄图抢劫弹药车。“决不能让武器落入暴徒之手！”干部、党员纷纷站出来，手挽手、肩并肩，在弹药车周围迅速组成一道道坚固的人墙……
    6月4日，这支部队的第一批哨兵列队走向建国门立交桥哨位。士兵们首先向围观的群众敬了一个庄严的军礼，人群中骤然爆出一阵热烈的掌声。
    骄阳似火。建国门立交桥上的哨兵，头戴钢盔，手握钢枪，英姿勃勃。正是在这里，这支部队露宿、被围困长达6天6夜。在露宿桥头的日日夜夜里，官兵们任凭烈日晒、大雨淋，吃不上饭，喝不上水。有的连队炊事车被烧，40多人熬一棵元白菜充饥；有的连队三天没有吃上盐；有一个连两天没有东西吃，司务长不知从什么地方找来一根香肠，但官兵们推来让去谁也不肯咬一口，还是连长下了“命令”，将这根20来厘米长的香肠切成40多片，全连每人尝了一片……在这里，100多名官兵被打伤，40多台军车被烧毁，压缩饼干、雨衣、背包以至官兵的提包被抢走，在部分不明真相的群众不理解、不信任的日子里，官兵们默默地忍受了一切。
    一天，有几个市民找到部队首长说：“6月3日晚，我们在桥上骂你们，真对不起！”此后，立交桥上经常有市民以各种方式向部队表达他们的歉意和谢意。年逾花甲的赵大爷，每天中午熬两桶绿豆汤送到桥头；光华路三小四年级二班的10来个小学生，天天放学后给执勤的哨兵送水，他们还把零花钱攒到一块儿，买了西瓜送给哨兵；北京日化二厂的班车天天经过立交桥，工人们目睹哨兵汗流满面，军装湿透，便给部队送去几十箱洗衣粉；每晚9点一过，桥上如有群众围观，附近居民便会自动出来维持秩序，劝说人们离开……
    人民的子弟兵，对人民和人民的财产，有着深沉的爱。
    6月6日凌晨，露宿建国门立交桥头的这支部队接到紧急命令：以最快的速度赶到和平街北口。他们及时赶到后看到，几十辆公共汽车被推在道路中央，车上放满了花圈，少数闹事的歹徒煽动数千名不明真相的群众聚集在此。歹徒们扬言要为“烈士”开追悼会，还要烧毁数十辆公共汽车。
    3点40分，部队长张作礼带领官兵冒着掷来的雨点般的砖头、汽水瓶，一面疏散不明真相的群众，一面迅速包围了汽车和歹徒。混乱之际，一名歹徒刚点着一个自制的燃烧瓶时，参谋宫富强就一个箭步冲上前去，用手扑灭了火苗。半个小时之后，28个歹徒全部落网。
    当晚11点多，张作礼又率领200多名官兵跑步前进，与公安人员一起包围了一家商店，迅速将妄图抢劫商店的35名歹徒全部抓获，保住了国家的财产。
    这支部队受到解放军三总部的通令嘉奖。他们被群众誉为“人民的卫士”，是当之无愧的。
