Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, met with a delegation from the Socialist Unity Party of Germany led by Günter Schabowski, a member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, this morning in Zhongnanhai.

Jiang Zemin first extended a warm welcome to the German guests and briefed them on the situation in Beijing following the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in early June.

He said, "This incident has taught us a profound lesson, making us further realize the importance of strengthening education in socialism, patriotism, and historical knowledge in the educational sector and among students."

He said, "True friends stand together in times of adversity." China, in this difficult time, has received understanding and support from the German Democratic Republic. We are both standing on the position of Marxism.

Schabowski thanked Jiang Zemin for the briefing on the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing and said that the Socialist Unity Party of Germany believes this is an internal affair of China. The Communist Party of China has the right to suppress and handle counter-revolutionary, anti-socialist, and anti-party activities.

He said, "The Socialist Unity Party of Germany is very concerned about the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and believes that all the actions taken by the plenary session are necessary."

Schabowski also briefed Jiang Zemin on the recent work of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany.

Li Ximing, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, Chen Xitong, a member of the Central Committee, State Councilor, and Mayor of Beijing, Li Shucen, Deputy Director of the International Liaison Department, and others attended the meeting.

Bertold, the Ambassador of the German Democratic Republic to China, also attended the meeting.

    江泽民首先对民主德国客人来访表示热烈欢迎，并向他们介绍了今年6月初北京平息反革命暴乱的情况。
    他说，这次事件给我们的教训是深刻的，使我们进一步认识到在教育领域、在学生中加强社会主义、爱国主义和历史知识教育的重要性。

    沙博夫斯基还向江泽民介绍了德国统一社会党近来的工作。
