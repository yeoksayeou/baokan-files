In a peaceful environment, the military has established many farms. Here, countless soldiers have been silently dedicating themselves to reducing national military expenditures and enhancing the combat effectiveness of the troops. Qu Youqing, a model farm manager of a certain regiment in the Beijing Garrison and a Communist Party member, is one such soldier.

Qu Youqing, now 42 years old, has been at this farm for 18 years, starting with pig farming, then becoming an assistant and finally the farm manager. Over the past three years, the farm he leads has generated revenue of over 10 million yuan, providing the troops with 2 million kilograms of grain, 100,000 kilograms of fresh eggs, and 50,000 kilograms of fresh fish.

Eighteen years ago, when Qu Youqing first arrived at the farm, his superiors assigned him to raise pigs. Without any complaints, he dedicated himself to this task for seven years. In 1979, when his father was critically ill, a telegram was sent to call him back home, but he did not return. Soon after, his father, who was just over 50, passed away. The old man left behind a final wish: "Let Youqing do well in the army." In the autumn of 1982, when Qu Youqing had just become the deputy farm manager, his 8-year-old son unfortunately drowned in their hometown in Hunan. He hurried back for a few days, but concerned about the farm's autumn harvest, he quickly returned and threw himself into the busy work.

In 1984, his wife was approved to join him in the military. Someone suggested he arrange for his wife to work in the city, making it easier for the children to go to school, but he believed that doing so would make him frequently travel to the city, affecting the farm's work. He insisted on arranging for his wife to work as a temporary worker near the farm. To this day, Qu Youqing and his family live in a small brick house on the farm, together with the soldiers, truly making the farm their home. Inspired by him, all the officers and soldiers on the farm work tirelessly in this remote field, silently dedicating themselves. Many soldiers, even when their service is up, are reluctant to leave.

The farm has no budget and relies entirely on its own revenue. In the past, due to poor management, the farm was always in the red. Qu Youqing learned from local experiences and implemented a contract responsibility system and scientific farming. During the busy farming season, the farm was short of labor. He requested permission from the regiment's leaders to have each company take on 40 mu of land, with 60% of the surplus grain after the autumn harvest going to the company; he broke down various production targets, letting the soldiers take on fixed quotas, fixed positions, with clear targets for output value, profit indicators, consumption limits, and reward and punishment standards. This greatly motivated the officers and soldiers of the farm.

Qu Youqing also humbly sought advice from agricultural experts, implementing scientific production. He set up a brewery, using the spent grain to feed pigs; he established a poultry farm, using chicken manure to feed fish; he opened a fish pond, using the pond mud and pig manure as organic fertilizer for the rice fields. In this way, agriculture, animal husbandry, and fisheries complement and promote each other, making the farm thrive in all sectors, with an annual per capita output value exceeding 10,000 yuan.

In the past three years, this farm has become increasingly prosperous, making it the "richest" among the many military farms in the Beijing Garrison. Whenever the rice harvest is bountiful, individual merchants from society flock to buy the rice at high prices, and some fish merchants also come to purchase fresh fish in bulk. Last autumn, when the market price of rice suddenly rose, many grain merchants came to "negotiate" with Qu Youqing, offering to buy the rice at around 1.2 yuan per kilogram. Faced with this situation, Qu Youqing firmly stated that the military's purpose in running a farm is to improve the construction of the troops and reduce the state's financial burden, and it is not to make money at the expense of the military's reputation.

At the beginning of last year, after the price adjustment of pork, the market supply of piglets became tight. The farm had over 300 piglets at the time, which could have fetched over 40,000 yuan if sold in the market, but he did not sell them at a high price and instead distributed all the piglets to the companies.

Over the years, he has always supplemented the companies with a large amount of grain, meat, and fish each year. While ensuring self-sufficiency for the troops, he has sold 600,000 kilograms of grain to the state over three years.

The farm has become prosperous, but Qu Youqing never flaunts his wealth. He leads by example, ensuring that he does not covet, does not take, does not be greedy, and does not be lazy. To prevent the farm's property from being misappropriated, he uses economic leverage principles to establish a strict set of rules. Whether it is senior leaders or work teams from the troops visiting the farm, he leads by example in not buying hospitality cigarettes and alcohol, and not engaging in extravagant banquets. The brewery, in order to expand production, needed to expand the factory building. If they hired an external construction team, it would cost at least 450,000 yuan. To save money, Qu Youqing led the soldiers to work overtime and build a new factory building with limited resources, resulting in a cost of only 45,000 yuan. Qu Youqing said, "I often think, if every regiment in the military can run a good farm, how much military expenditure can the entire military save for the state? How good it would be to use this money to support the state's modernization construction!"

    农场十八年
    ——记北京卫戍区某团农场场长、共产党员瞿友清
    王玉存　张永敏
    在和平环境下，我军办起了许多农场。在这里，无数军人为减少国家军费开支，增强部队战斗力，默默地奉献着一切。北京卫戍区某团先进农场场长、共产党员瞿友清就是一位这样的军人。
    42岁的瞿友清来到这个农场已经18年了，先是喂猪，后任助理员、农场场长。3年来，他领导的农场创收百万元，为部队提供粮食200万公斤，鲜蛋10万公斤，鲜鱼5万公斤。
    18年前，瞿友清刚来农场时，领导分配他养猪，他毫无怨言，一干就是7年。1979年父亲病危，来电报催他回去，他没顾上回家。不久，刚过50岁的父亲就去世了。老人在弥留之际留下一句话：“让友清在部队好好干。”1982年秋，瞿友清刚当了副场长，8岁的儿子不幸在老家湖南溺水死亡。他匆匆回去几天，惦念着农场的秋收大忙，很快就回来了，投入到紧张的劳动之中。
    1984年，他的妻子被批准随军来部队，有人劝他把妻子安排到城里工作，孩子上学也方便，他却认为那样他也就得经常跑城里，会影响农场工作，硬是把妻子安排在农场附近当临时工。直至如今，瞿友清夫妇和孩子一家挤在农场一间小砖房子里，和战士们生活在一起，真正做到了“以场为家”。在他的感召下，全场官兵一年到头奋战在这偏僻的田野上，默默地奉献着。许多战士该退伍了，还舍不得离去。
    农场是没有什么经费的，全靠自己创收。过去，这个农场由于经营管理不善，年年亏损。瞿友清吸收地方经验，实行了承包责任制和科学种田。农场农忙时劳力紧张，他向团里领导请示，让全团每个连队承包40亩地，秋后粮食超产部分60％收入归连队；把各项生产指标分解开来，让战士们定额承包，定岗定位，做到产值有目标，利润有指标，消耗有限制，奖惩有标准。从而大大调动了农场官兵的积极性。
    瞿友清还虚心向农科所专家求教，实行科学生产。他办起了酿酒厂，用酒糟喂猪；他办起了养鸡厂，用鸡粪喂鱼；他开了一片鱼塘，用塘泥和猪粪做稻田的有机肥料。这样，农副渔业互相衔接、促进，农场很快做到了诸业兴旺，年人均产值逾万元。
    近3年，这个农场越办越好，成为北京卫戍区众多部队农场的“首富”。每当稻谷丰收时，社会上的个体商贩闻讯纷纷拥来，愿意高价收买稻谷，还有一些鱼贩子也来求批发鲜鱼。去年秋后，市场上大米价格骤涨，许多粮贩子前来和瞿友清“泡蘑菇”，以每公斤1.2元左右的价格要求收购。面对这种情况，瞿友清坚决表示，部队办农场只有一个目的，是为了搞好部队建设减轻国家的经费开支，决不能单纯为了捞钱，损坏军队声誉。
    去年年初，猪肉价格调整后，市场上仔猪供应吃紧，农场当时存栏仔猪300余头，如到市场上出售，可收入4万余元，但他不售高价，将仔猪全部分给了连队。
    几年来，他每年都要为连队补助大量的粮食、肉、鱼，在保证部队自给的情况下，他3年向国家交售粮食60万公斤。
    农场富了，但瞿友清从不摆阔，自己带头做到不馋、不沾、不贪、不懒。为了杜绝农场的财物外流，他用经济杠杆原理，制定出一套严格的规章制度，不论是上级首长，还是部队工作组到农场，他带头做到不买招待烟酒，不搞大吃大喝。造酒厂为了扩大再生产，需扩建厂房，如在外请包工队干，至少也要花4.5万元。为节省资金，瞿友清带领战士们加班加点，因陋就简盖起了新厂房，结果只花了4500元。瞿友清说得好：“我常常想，我们军队如果每个团都能办好一个农场，那么，全军给国家节约多少军费开支呢？用这笔钱再去支援国家四化建设该多好啊！”
