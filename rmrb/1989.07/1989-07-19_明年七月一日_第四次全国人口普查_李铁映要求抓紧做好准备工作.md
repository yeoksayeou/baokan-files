The State Council has officially decided to conduct the fourth national census on July 1, 1990. The State Council's leading group for the fourth national census was established and began work today.

According to reports, this large-scale social survey will focus on clarifying the changes in China's population in terms of quantity, regional distribution, structure, and quality since the third census. It will also check the implementation of the population control targets for the year 2000 and provide a scientific basis for formulating population, education, employment, industrial, and other socio-economic development policies.

Li Tieying, a State Councilor and the head of the State Council's leading group for the fourth national census, pointed out at the group's first meeting today that the census is a major survey of national conditions and strength, involving every household and individual. It is also a major educational campaign on population issues. Mobilizing and organizing social forces is key to successfully conducting the fourth national census. With less than a year until the census, the tasks are heavy, and we must immediately take action to carry out various preparatory work.

According to information from the National Bureau of Statistics, the fourth census will focus on the permanent resident population, with each person registered at their usual place of residence. Census takers will be selected from among party and government officials, enterprise and institution employees, public security personnel responsible for household registration, primary and secondary school teachers, and retired cadres. Currently, half of the provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country have established census leading groups.

    明年七月一日——
    第四次全国人口普查
    李铁映要求抓紧做好准备工作
    新华社北京7月19日电　（记者吴士深）国务院正式决定，1990年7月1日进行第四次全国人口普查。国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组今天成立并开始工作。
    据介绍，这次大规模的社会调查将重点查清第三次人口普查以来我国人口在数量、地区分布、结构和素质方面的变化；检查2000年的人口控制目标执行情况，为科学地制定人口、教育、就业、产业等社会经济发展决策提供依据。
    国务委员、国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组组长李铁映今天在领导小组首次会议上指出，人口普查是重大的国情国力调查，涉及千家万户直至每一个人。它也是一次人口意识的大教育。能否动员和组织社会力量是搞好第四次人口普查的关键。现在离普查时间不到一年，任务十分繁重，必须立即行动起来开展各项准备工作。
    据记者从国家统计局了解，第四次人口普查以常住人口为普查对象，每个人必须在常驻地进行登记。参加普查的普查员将从党政机关干部、企业事业单位职工、户籍民警、中小学教师以及离退休干部中选调。目前全国已有一半省、市、自治区建立了人口普查领导小组。
