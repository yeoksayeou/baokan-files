    新华社开罗7月29日电  据中东通讯社报道，埃及外交事务国务部长加里今天谴责了以色列绑架黎巴嫩真主党领导人奥贝德的恐怖行为。
    加里说，这一恐怖主义行动是不利于中东地区的和平的，并会诱发暴力和极端行为。
    以色列突击队员7月28日袭击了黎巴嫩南部的一个村庄，冲进奥贝德家中，绑架了奥贝德和他的两位亲属。一位邻居在袭击中被以色尔突击队员开枪打死。
    另据黎巴嫩电台广播，黎巴嫩穆斯林代总理胡斯今天发表声明，谴责以色列绑架奥贝德的行为，并呼吁国际红十字会驻黎机构竭尽全力保证奥贝德和他的两名亲属的安全。
    胡斯还打电报给黎巴嫩常驻联合国代表，要求联合国召开会议讨论以色列的恐怖行为。
