Currently, the organizational structures of large-scale enterprise groups in our country are becoming increasingly diverse.

By the end of 1988, according to incomplete statistics from 33 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as municipalities with separate planning status, enterprise groups with a certain scale have developed to around 1,500. Enterprise groups that were formed relatively early in the horizontal economic cooperation have, in recent years, continued to grow and strengthen on the basis of consolidation and improvement. Some enterprise groups have large scales, such as the Second Automobile Works Group. By the end of April this year, the number of member units had grown to 282.

Through several years of development, enterprise groups have generally adopted organizational forms that suit their actual situations, thus playing an active role in group organization functions. Some groups were designed and built from the outset according to the scale of large-scale joint enterprises. This type of inherently large-scale enterprise group, on the one hand, has carried out new project constructions according to supplementary plans and designs, continuously expanding its scale; on the other hand, it has also developed through horizontal cooperation and mergers. Some groups use a main product as a link, with a large enterprise as the core, combining and merging several enterprises and research institutions to form a core layer with integrated assets and operations. On the basis of the core layer, a group company is established. Some groups, based on the joint investment and joint ventures of many related large and medium-sized enterprises and research institutions, establish a substantive group company. These different types of enterprise groups have all made positive contributions to the development of the national economy.

Currently, there are some problems in the organization and development of enterprise groups: First, under the current financial and tax system, regions and departments have independent economic interests, often becoming major obstacles to the formation and development of the core layer of enterprise groups. Second, due to the forced combination by relevant government departments, it often deviates from the mutual needs of enterprises, violating the principles of voluntariness and mutual benefit. Third, some groups are not well-matched and incomplete, and some regulations are not yet perfect.

    振兴经济的主力军不断壮大
    大型企业集团结构趋向多样化
    组织与发展工作仍需改进和完善
    本报北京7月15日讯  目前，我国的大型企业集团组织结构类型正趋多样化。
    1988年底，据33个省市、自治区和计划单列市的不完全统计，具有一定规模的企业集团已发展到1500家左右。在横向经济联合中较早组建起来的企业集团，近年来在巩固、提高的基础上不断发展壮大。一些企业集团规模较大，如二汽集团，截至今年4月底，成员单位已发展到282家。
    通过几年来的发展，企业集团大都采用了适合于自己实际情况的组织形式，因而都发挥着积极的集团组织功能。有的一开始就按照大型联合企业规模设计建设。这类先天性的大型企业集团，一方面按照补充的规划、设计，陆续进行了新的项目建设，不断扩大规模；另一方面，在横向联合、兼并中又有了新的发展。有的是以主导产品为纽带，以一个大型企业为核心，联合、兼并若干企业、科研单位，组成资产一体化、经营一体化的核心层，在核心层的基础上组建集团公司。有的是在众多的有关大中型企业、科研单位联合体的基础上实行共同投资、合资兴办，组建一个实体性的集团公司。这些不同类型的企业集团，都为发展国民经济作出了积极贡献。
    目前，组织与发展企业集团工作存在一些问题：一、在现行财税体制下，地区、部门都存在着条块分割的独立经济利益，往往成为企业集团核心层形成和发展的重大障碍。二、由于政府有关部门的强行捏合，往往背离企业之间的相互需要，违背自愿、互利原则。三、有的集团发展不配套、不完善，有些法规还不健全。（邢幼青）
