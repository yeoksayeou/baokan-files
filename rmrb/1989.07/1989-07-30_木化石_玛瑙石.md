A piece of firewood. A piece of stone.

At the border defense unit of the Xinjiang Military Region's Naomuhu Lake, I received from the platoon leader Guo Hui a piece of what is said to be a 150-million-year-old fossilized wood. The clear annual rings and jagged edges on the stone are just like a piece of firewood.

Guo, the platoon leader, repeatedly asked me to go to the fossilized wood forest the next day, saying it was worth seeing. Although I wanted to go, my schedule for the next day's interviews was already set, so I had to suppress my desire and ask Guo to describe the scene of the fossilized wood. Sometimes, hearing someone else describe a scene is more interesting than seeing it yourself, because it leaves more room for imagination.

The wood stone forest is located in the barren desert of the border restricted area. It was discovered and confirmed from aerial photographs taken by surveying troops in recent years. When you first enter, it truly makes you marvel. The ground is bare with a fallen forest, the half-trunks of trees broken at the waist are raised towards the sky, the thick roots preserved from millions of years ago, the thick trunks pushing and pressing against each other, the fine branches intertwined... As I listened, I could almost hear the rustling of the pine forest, the heavy groans of ancient trees falling, and the fossilized wood seemed to ooze drops of life's essence. The evolution of nature is truly amazing; time turns wood into stone.

Love while you can,
Don't wait until it turns to stone.

A line of poetry I had memorized at some point suddenly flashed through my mind. Accompanying it was a faint sense of pity. I couldn't bear to look at Guo and the fossilized wood anymore. I didn't know about the life of a border defense officer, which was almost like that of an ascetic monk. Fortunately, Guo didn't mind my change in mood; he continued enthusiastically to describe the scenery of the wood stone forest. Although he loved his border post, he also ignored others' pity.

In comparison, I felt the vulgarity of my own advantages.

After dinner, Deputy Platoon Leader Sun Lin invited me to appreciate his collection of Naomuhu Lake's rare treasures. He bent down, sticking his head, neck, and arms under the bed, pulling out a wooden box. He unlocked it, took out a heavy package, and with a rustle, spread it out on the glass tabletop, revealing a dazzling array of stones. The large ones were like fists or eggs, the small ones like beans or pearls. The red ones were like blood, the white ones like milk, the yellow ones like egg yolks, and there were also mixed ones of red, yellow, green, and white, with clear patterns, shiny and smooth, making one marvel in admiration.

The desert of Naomuhu Lake is rich in agate. Sun Lin said that these high-quality agate stones in his collection were picked up during patrols. He planned to use these stones to make a necklace for his wife in Lanzhou.

Whether it is the barren desert or the ancient plateau, it cannot suppress or kill the great love in life—fossilized wood, agate stone, do they not all contain such themes of life? As I was leaving, Sun Lin picked out an egg-sized one from his collection and gave it to me. I quickly put it in my pocket and decided to keep it forever.

Love while you can,
Don't wait until it turns to stone.

At night, the two lines of poetry kept repeating in my mind, keeping me awake for a long time.

    木化石·玛瑙石
    张际会
    一块劈柴。一块石头。
    在新疆军区淖毛湖边防连，我收下连长郭辉送给的一块据说有一亿五千万年历史的木化石。石上清晰的年轮线和参差的断茬，活脱脱一块劈柴。
    郭连长再三要求我次日专程去木化石林看看，说那里很值得一看。我虽想去，但第二天采访日程已定，只好压下心头欲望，请郭连长讲讲木化石的情形。有时，听到别人讲景比亲眼观景更富意趣，因其中留有更多的想象空间。
    木石林位于边境禁区的洪荒戈壁，是近年从航测兵的照片上分析得知而后实地证实的。初进时真让人惊叹不止，大地上裸着一片倒伏的森林，拦腰折断的半截树桩昂首青天，高高翘起的树根保留着亿万年前的原貌，粗壮的躯干你挤我压，细密的枝杈交错盘结……听着听着，耳际便隐约响起阵阵松涛，响起古木倒地时沉重的呻吟，眼前木化石也仿佛渗出滴滴生命的脂液。大自然的演进真不可思议，时间将木头化为石头。
    能爱就抓紧爱吧
    不要等变作石头
    脑中呼一下闪出这么一句不知何时记下的诗句。伴之而来的还有一线同情般的酸楚。我不忍心直视郭连长和木化石了。我不知道边防军官那种近于苦行僧的生活。好在郭连长没在乎我情绪的变化，他仍在兴致很高地给我介绍木石林之景。他虽然热爱自己的边关，也漠视别人的怜悯。
    相形之下，我觉出了自身优越的卑琐。
    饭后，副连长孙霖请我欣赏他收藏的淖毛湖的奇珍。他猫起腰，将头、颈和胳膊潜至床下，拖出一只木箱，开锁，提出一只沉甸甸的包袱，哗啦一声往桌面玻璃板上一摊，散开一片五彩缤纷的石头。大的如拳，如卵，小的如豆，如珠，红者如血，白者如乳，黄者如蛋核，还有红黄绿白混杂者，花纹明晰，晶莹圆润，令人赞叹不已。
    淖毛湖的戈壁滩上多玛瑙。孙霖说，他收藏的这些高质量的玛瑙石，是巡逻中拾得的，他打算用这些石头，为远在兰州的妻子加工一串项链。
    无论是洪荒戈壁还是千古高原，都不能禁锢扼杀生命力中伟大的爱——木化石、玛瑙石，不都孕含着这样的生活命题么？临别，孙霖从他的收藏中挑出鸡蛋大的一枚赠我，我赶紧放入衣袋，并决心永久保存。
    能爱就抓紧爱吧
    莫要等变作石头
    入夜，两句诗在脑子里翻来复去，折腾得我很长时间难以成眠。
