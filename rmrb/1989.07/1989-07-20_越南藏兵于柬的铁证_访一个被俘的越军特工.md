In the dense forests of Cambodia, we have encountered Vietnamese prisoners of war more than once. Some were captured after intense battles, their eyes covered, led along forest paths by the Khmer People's National Liberation Armed Forces (KPNLAF). Others, dressed in military uniforms, sat quietly as they were questioned by journalists from various countries. However, during our reporting in the western Cambodian battlefield of Poipet in April and May of this year, we witnessed a different scene: in a thatched hut surrounded by trees, a young man who, in both appearance and dress, was indistinguishable from a Khmer person, sat on a long bench. Near the window sat his wife and child. This seemed like a typical Cambodian farming family. But no! This man was a captured Vietnamese platoon leader. He had been disguised as a Khmer farmer and engaged in espionage activities for over two years. In January of this year, he was captured by the KPNLAF while on a reconnaissance mission. He revealed that Vietnam had long been planning a scheme: after withdrawing most of its invading troops from Cambodia, it would announce the "complete withdrawal" of its forces. The remaining soldiers would either hide in the deep mountains and forests or disguise themselves as Khmers, lying in wait in the villages and the institutions of the Heng Samrin regime, in order to continue controlling Cambodia.

Under our questioning, the broad-eyed, flat-nosed, and disheveled platoon leader, Hoang Ngoc Thanh, fluently spoke in Khmer about how he was ordered to become an underground agent. He was born into a farming family in South Vietnam, is 25 years old, and had attended high school in Saigon. In February 1982, he was conscripted into the military and sent to Cambodia. He served in the 5th Division of the Vietnamese army and was promoted to platoon leader of the 3rd Battalion, 4th Regiment in 1984. According to him, starting in 1985, the invading Vietnamese forces began implementing the "Vietnamization of Khmer" plan. One part of this plan was to select some Vietnamese soldiers to marry Khmer women, gradually transforming them into civilians in rural areas and towns, engaging in underground work, or placing them in the Heng Samrin regime and military as officials. These individuals had to meet three conditions: be loyal members of the Vietnamese Communist Party; speak Khmer fluently; and have appearances similar to Khmers. He met all three conditions and was thus chosen by the Vietnamese military leadership. In 1985, his superiors sent him to a Khmer language class, where he excelled. By the end of that year, he married a village girl named Ben in the village of Tangon in the commune of Banglay in the district of Pursat in the province of Battambang, and they had a son. In 1987, he was ordered to transfer to civilian life as a Cambodian farmer, living with his mother-in-law, while maintaining close contact with the Vietnamese military and executing secret orders from his superiors. According to him, there were about 20 Vietnamese soldiers in his 4th Regiment alone who were "transferred" at the same time as him.

Hoang Ngoc Thanh clearly remembers the scene when his superiors gave him the "transfer" mission. In the sweltering thatched hut, he told us, "It was a daytime in July 1987. An officer from the 979th Command of the Vietnamese forces in Cambodia came to our regiment's headquarters and summoned me. He said to me: 'Now, I have a mission for you. You are to immediately transfer from the military to become a Cambodian. You must make the locals believe that you are voluntarily staying in Cambodia as a Khmer. The political commissar of the regiment, Tang, added: 'Our troops will eventually withdraw from Cambodia, but we will not truly withdraw. We will leave a strong underground force. After you become a Cambodian, you must keep it a secret from your parents and wife. We have already told your parents in Vietnam that you have gone missing. Your parents must be very worried. But when you become a high-ranking official in Cambodia in the future, they will be overjoyed!'" In this way, Hoang Ngoc Thanh repeatedly completed the espionage missions given to him by the regiment. On November 11 of this year, when he infiltrated a village in the district of Ta Moa in the province of Battambang, which had been liberated by the KPNLAF, he was captured by the KPNLAF.

"We want to hear about your experiences after being captured!" we requested. Hoang Ngoc Thanh said, "After being captured, I immediately thought of the brutal methods the Vietnamese military uses against captured agents: hunting down or arresting family members. So, I immediately asked the KPNLAF to rescue my wife and child. The KPNLAF indeed did so." Speaking of this, the sun was setting. A few rays of sunlight pierced through the thatched hut's curtains and shone on Hoang Ngoc Thanh's wife, Ben, who was sitting silently by the window. The thin Ben said that after her husband was captured, the Vietnamese military immediately sent people to search her home and monitor her. Fortunately, her cousin, who was a member of the KPNLAF, secretly informed her to go to a bridge outside the village on April 13 to meet with the KPNLAF. Mother and child were finally rescued by the KPNLAF to the liberated area and reunited with Hoang Ngoc Thanh. When we asked Ben about her husband's true identity and why he was captured, she knew nothing, but she was grateful to the KPNLAF for rescuing her and her child. She always thought her husband was a South Vietnamese who had come to Cambodia, truly left the military, and transferred to farming.

After finishing his story, Hoang Ngoc Thanh sighed, "I originally thought I was fulfilling my internationalist duty by coming to Cambodia. Later, I gradually realized this was an invasion. Vietnam will not withdraw its troops voluntarily. I am willing to become a Cambodian forever and participate in the anti-Vietnamese struggle. Otherwise, I will just be an ordinary villager!"

    越南藏兵于柬的铁证
    ——访一个被俘的越军特工
    杨木
    在柬埔寨莽林里，我们遇见越军俘虏已不只一次了。有的是激战后溃散的越兵，他们被民柬国民军抓获后蒙着眼睛，沿着林间小路被押送出来。有的是穿着军装、端坐着接受各国记者的询问……而今年4、5月间，我们在柬埔寨西部诗梳风战场采访时见到的却是另一种景象：在林荫环抱的一间茅棚里，一个从衣着到相貌与高棉人无异的青年坐在一张长板凳上，近窗口处坐着他的妻子和幼儿。这是一个典型的柬埔寨农民家庭吧？不！这个男子是被俘的越军连长。他潜化为高棉农民、从事特工活动已两年多了。今年1月，他在执行侦探任务时被民柬国民军俘虏了。他供出越南早就策划的这样一种图谋：把侵柬越军撤走大半后就宣布“全部撤军”完毕，余下官兵或隐藏于深山老林或潜化为高棉人，伏兵于农村和韩桑林政权机构，以便继续控制柬埔寨。
    在我们询问下，这个大眼、扁鼻、蓬发的连长高玉成，用十分流利的柬语向我们叙说他奉命充当地下特工的经过。他出生于南越一个农民家庭，现年25岁，曾在西贡念高中。1982年2月应召当兵，被派到柬埔寨。在越军第5师服役，1984年晋升为该师第4团第3营的连长。据他说，1985年开始，侵柬越军就开始执行“越南人高棉化”的计划，其中一项就是挑选一些越军官兵娶柬女为妻，逐步转化为农村、城镇的平民、商人，从事地下工作或把他们安插在韩桑林政权和军队中当官。这些人必须具备三个条件：忠诚的越共党员；柬语讲得好；相貌像高棉人。他符合这三项条件，因此，被越军领导选中。1985年，上级派他参加柬语学习班，成绩优异。同年年底，在柬埔寨马德望省普农斯罗县邦莱乡塔贡村与一位名叫本的村女结婚，生下一子。1987年，他奉命转业为柬埔寨农民，生活在岳母家，实际上与越军保持密切联系，执行上级的秘密指令。据他说，与他同时“转业”的越军官兵，仅在他所在的第4团就有20人左右。
    高玉成清楚地记得上级领导向他下达“转业”任务时的情景。在闷热的茅棚里，他对我们说：“那是1987年7月的一个白天，越军驻柬埔寨979司令部的一位长官来到我们团的团部并召见我。他对我说：现在给你一项任务，立即从军队转业成为柬埔寨人。你要让当地人相信，你是自愿留在柬埔寨当高棉人的。团政委唐接着说：我们的军队迟早要撤出柬埔寨，但我们不会真正撤军，要留下强大的地下力量。你转为柬埔寨人之后，要向父母妻子保密。我们已经告诉你在越南的父母，说你失踪了。你父母现在一定很耽心。可是，当你将来在柬埔寨当大官时，他们会喜出望外的！”就这样，高玉成屡次完成团部给他的特工任务。今年11月11日，当他潜入马德望省特莫博县一个被民柬国民军解放了的村子侦探时，被国民军抓获了。
      “谈谈你被俘后的经历吧！”我们提出了要求。高玉成说：“被俘后，我立即想起越军对付被俘特工的残酷手段：追杀或逮捕家属。于是，我立即请求国民军把我的妻儿救出来。国民军果然这样做了。”谈到这里，太阳西斜了。几束阳光穿过茅屋挡帘照到坐在窗边沉默无语的高玉成妻子本身上。瘦小的本说，她的丈夫被俘后，越军果然立刻派人到她家搜查并监视她。幸好，她的参加国民军的堂哥秘密通知她于4月13日到村外一座桥头与国民军接头。母子终于被国民军接到解放区与高玉成团聚。当我们向本询问她丈夫的真实身份和为何被俘等情节时，她一无所知，但却对国民军搭救她母子怀着感激之情。她一直认为丈夫是南越下柬埔寨人，真的离开越军，转业务农了。
    讲完他的故事后，高玉成感慨地说：“我原认为，我是执行国际主义义务而来柬埔寨的，后来才逐步明白这是一场侵略战争。越南是不会自动撤军的。我愿永远当个柬埔寨人，参加抗越斗争。不然，就当个安份村民！”
