    VIENNA — NATO countries yesterday presented a specific proposal at the conclusion of the second round of negotiations at the European Conventional Arms Control Conference.

    NATO proposed that the maximum number of troops the United States and the Soviet Union can deploy in the territories of other European countries should be 275,000. This means the United States should withdraw 30,000 troops, while the Soviet Union should withdraw 325,000 troops from East Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, and Poland. The military units of the withdrawn U.S. and Soviet troops should be disbanded, and their equipment should be destroyed.

    NATO also proposed that both NATO and the Warsaw Pact should each retain a maximum of 5,700 fighter aircraft and 1,900 attack helicopters. This means NATO would need to destroy 900 fighter aircraft and 300 attack helicopters, while the Warsaw Pact would need to destroy 7,900 fighter aircraft and 800 attack helicopters. Variants of these aircraft, such as support and training aircraft, should also be included in the reduction.

    NATO's aforementioned proposal is a concrete implementation of the arms reduction proposal made by U.S. President Bush before the NATO summit in late May. According to reports, NATO originally planned to present this specific proposal at the beginning of the third round of talks on September 7, but it was brought forward to accelerate the negotiation process.

    Both NATO and the Warsaw Pact expressed satisfaction with the progress of the second round of negotiations. West German Foreign Minister Genscher expressed hope for a breakthrough. The head of the Soviet delegation, Grinevsky, welcomed NATO's early presentation of the specific proposal but expressed regret that the British, French, and Canadian troops stationed in West Germany were not included.

    According to reports, the third phase of the conference, which will begin in September, will discuss issues such as the definition of artillery and aircraft, geographical definitions, and NATO support troops stationed in West Germany. Verification issues will also be on the agenda.

    欧洲常规裁军会议第二轮谈判结束
    北约提出裁军具体方案
    本报波恩7月14日电　记者江建国报道：维也纳消息，北约国家昨天在维也纳欧洲常规裁军会议第二轮谈判结束的时候，提出了一项具体方案。
    北约建议，美国和苏联在欧洲别国领土上部署的军队最高限额为27.5万人。这样，美国应撤走3万人，苏联应从民主德国、匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克、保加利亚和波兰撤走32.5万人。撤回本土的美苏部队建制应予解散，其装备予以销毁。
    北约还建议，北约和华约双方各自保留的战斗机最高限额为5700架，战斗直升机为1900架。这样，北约必须销毁900架战斗机和300架战斗直升机，华约必须销毁7900架战斗机和800架战斗直升机。上述飞机的变种，如支援机和教练机也应纳入裁减范围。
    北约的上述建议是对美国总统布什5月底在北约首脑会议前夕提出的裁军建议的具体化。据报道，北约本来打算在9月7日第三轮谈判开始时提出这个具体方案，提前提出是为了加速谈判进程。
    北约和华约双方都对第二轮谈判进程表示满意。西德外长根舍表示对实现突破寄予希望。苏联代表团团长格里涅夫斯基欢迎北约提前提出具体方案。但对驻扎在西德的英、法、加拿大军队未包括在内表示遗憾。
    据报道，9月开始的第三阶段会议将就炮兵、飞机的定义，地域定义和驻扎在西德的北约后援部队等问题进行讨论，核查问题也是议题之一。
