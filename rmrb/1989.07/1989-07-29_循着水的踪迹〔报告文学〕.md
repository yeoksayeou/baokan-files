Water is both gentle and ruthless. Since humans began building shelters to protect themselves, water has relentlessly infiltrated every crack and crevice, posing a serious threat to life. This is especially true in China's rainy south, particularly in Shanghai, which is adjacent to both a river and the sea, and especially in the Dapu Road Tunnel, which has been submerged in the Huangpu River for 19 years!

Water, water, water... This is a place where water should not appear! Yet, what presented itself to Chief Engineer Wang Youting was water everywhere. The Dapu Road Tunnel, stretching 2367 meters, began construction in 1965 and opened to traffic in 1970. Over nearly 20 years, due to uneven settlement in the river and shore sections and the long-term dynamic load of nearly 170,000 vehicles passing through daily, the tunnel has deformed, and the coal sand mortar waterproof seams have cracked, leading to increasingly severe water seepage. As early as 1977, relevant authorities detected 474 leakage points in the upper and lower ventilation shafts of the tunnel. In 1982, a re-test found that the daily seepage volume had reached 242.33 cubic meters! Comprehensive repairs to the tunnel were now imperative.

In September 1988, Wang Youting's unit, the Xuzhou Engineering Academy of the People's Liberation Army, along with the Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Company, the Marine Geology Bureau, and the Third Research Institute of the Engineering Corps in Luoyang, jointly won the bid. In October, the waterproofing army, led by Wang Youting, marched into the construction site.

The sun that had been shining overhead suddenly disappeared. The tunnel was filled with dust, and the lights were as dim as fireflies. Three steps away, you couldn't see anyone. The dust accumulated behind the side walls was inches thick, as fine as talcum powder. When the steel drill and hammer struck, a cloud of black smoke billowed up. The smoke was mixed with a large amount of exhaust fumes from vehicles, stinging the eyes, nose, and lungs. Coughing echoed through the tunnel.

When the side wall panels were removed and the work surface was cleared, the scene before them was shocking: dozens of high-voltage power lines crisscrossed the tunnel walls, the highest reaching 1200 volts. Due to long-term neglect, the high-voltage lines occasionally sparked...

After just three days, shocking news spread through the construction site: more than 200 migrant workers recruited from rural areas had fled overnight, 28 of them, without even claiming their wages!

It was indeed tough. Since the work had to ensure normal traffic during the day, all construction had to be done at night. It was also the beginning of autumn after the scorching heat, and the young men all wanted to sleep. But the treacherous working environment and the demanding cutting procedures allowed no room for error. The migrant workers could roll up their bedding and leave, but the soldiers had only one choice: to fight on until victory, no matter how hard it was.

"Don't worry, we'll hold up the sky if it falls!" The commander of the training camp, Zhou Baolin, slammed a heavy sentence on the command center's desk and, putting on his boots, rushed into the tunnel at night. He gathered all the soldiers scattered among the migrant workers and reorganized them into a spearhead squad, saying, "Brothers, we have no way out, we must fight to the death!"

The tunnel immediately echoed with the roar of machinery. Dozens of cutting machines hummed in unison, like a squadron of bombers flying overhead. Advancing was extremely difficult. Both the upper and lower ventilation shafts were semi-circular. Cutting higher allowed them to stand upright, but cutting lower meant lying on the ground. After cutting a few grooves, the workers' bodies ached all over. Moreover, during the cutting process, sand and stone dust flew everywhere, and even a nine-layer cloth mask couldn't block it out.

"Ouch!" The spearhead squad leader, Shao Yongbo, carrying a cutting machine, pushed through the dark, dusty air and was about to move when a protruding steel bar pierced his calf, leaving a 5-inch-long wound. Blood flowed down his leg. To distract from the pain, he took a bandage from the medic, wrapped it around the wound, and immediately picked up the cutting machine and cut towards the leak point. When it was time to leave, he tried to take a step, but his injured leg was numb and couldn't move. Two soldiers supported him, limping out of the tunnel.

Zheng Zongfu, a deputy squad leader from Hubei, suddenly received a telegram saying his father was critically ill. The organization approved his return to his hometown, but his father, who was suffering from throat cancer, was already on his deathbed. Seeing his son, his father's face showed a sad smile: "Son, I'm content to see you one last time. Go back to your unit now, and don't come back after I'm gone."

Zheng returned to Shanghai soon after, but his father had already passed away. Zheng was drilling in the tunnel when he heard the news and burst into tears. The leader comforted him, "Zheng, go back and pack up, and go home tomorrow to bury your father." Zheng wiped away his tears and calmly said, "No, last time I went back, Father felt guilty. This time, I must not go against his last wish." Saying this, he picked up the drill and continued working, tears and sweat streaming down his face...

When Wang Youting stepped out of the tunnel, a kaleidoscopic world suddenly appeared before him: golden bees danced in the deep blue sky, buildings on both sides of the street swayed, and colorful figures on the street swam like tropical fish in the water... In an instant, he felt himself engulfed by a surging wave, his heavy body sliding uncontrollably towards an abyss.

"Director Wang! Director Wang! What's wrong? What's wrong?" The accompanying personnel saw the chief engineer's face turn pale, his breathing rapid, and quickly helped him into a jeep and sent him to the hospital.

Wang Youting was indeed too tired. As early as 1959, when he was a student at Taiyuan University of Technology, he participated in the waterproofing design and research of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. In the early 1960s, he was sent to Moscow and Leningrad and other major cities for waterproofing investigations. As soon as the underground palace of the Ming Tombs was excavated, he dove into the tomb, still emitting the foul smell of ancient corpses, and accumulated a lot of data on ancient Chinese waterproofing. In the following years, he participated in more than ten major engineering and scientific research projects, including the Yellow River Tunnel and the nuclear explosion simulator test. Because his feet had been in the water for too long, he had developed severe rheumatoid arthritis, walking with a limp. Two months ago, he fainted in his own toilet. But before the academy's health department could determine the cause, he brought his engineering and technical personnel to the Dapu Road Tunnel.

Just the day before, he braved the cold wind that could blow a person away and, with the help of others, crawled into the upper and lower ventilation shafts of the tunnel. He inspected each repaired section one by one. Based on the seepage situation of each section, he formulated specific sealing plans from material formulas to construction requirements. Waterproofing and sealing work is "three parts technology, seven parts operation," and every small detail must be personally inspected.

In the lower ventilation shaft, there was a section with deep water accumulation, making his inspection difficult. The accompanying technical personnel were ready to replace him, but he insisted on wading through the muddy water. They had no choice but to carry him through the muddy water step by step.

That night, Wang Youting was constantly moving around in the tunnel.

The news that Director Wang had suddenly fallen ill spread back to the command center, immediately alarming the academy's deputy director, Major General Xu Xinjiang, and the director of the administrative department, Colonel Zhao Jingen. They rushed to the hospital.

Wang Youting, who was receiving an IV, saw the academy leaders and comrades around him, and his eyes welled up with tears. He tightly held Xu's hand and said, "Go back, all of you go back to the construction site! The project is at a critical stage, and we can't afford to be careless!" He then told the engineer Ren Wuxian, who had always followed him, "The next step in sealing, it all depends on you. Please immediately bring in the key members of the waterproofing expert class and let them work with you to ensure the technical quality..."

Engineer Ren's eyes were filled with tears: "You rest assured in the hospital. Your heart is about to be worn out by the construction site..."

Ren had just seen the test results: Director Wang had heart disease, brain membrane cyst, and premature ventricular contraction! If not treated in time, the consequences would be unimaginable...

Ma Delin had not slept for a day and a night.

The project had entered the grouting and sealing stage. This involved using a closed method to inject liquid polyurethane sealant into the waterproof grooves using a grouting pump. When the sealant came into contact with the seepage water, it expanded dozens of times, ultimately sealing the cracks so that not a drop of water could pass through. This process required quick operation, and any delay would cause the sealant to expand and block the grouting pump's injection tube. The grouting machine had to be cleaned every day after use.

The task of cleaning the grouting machine fell to the soldier Ma Delin from Beijing. Ma had just completed the repair of the cutting machine alone, saving the academy tens of thousands of yuan in repair costs. When he heard that a dedicated person was needed to clean the grouting machine, he took on the task. The xylene used to clean the grouting machine is a toxic chemical that, through strong evaporation, enters the body through the skin pores and respiratory tract. Over time, it would cause blood poisoning. To ensure the smooth progress of the grouting, Ma ignored everything else.

The grouting machines were continuously sent from the construction site, and Ma worked day and night. Despite wearing a thick mask, the pungent and choking smell still pierced his nostrils and chest, making his internal organs churn, his head spin, and his eyes blur. He felt as if he had been lying in bed for hours, tossing and turning, unable to sleep. He only felt that his limbs were as soft as cotton, and his brain was buzzing.

The night before, Ma Delin worked from 10 PM to 3 AM, managing to clean 6 out of the 13 accumulated machines. He felt he couldn't hold on any longer. He hadn't been in bed long when the off-duty crowd brought in another ten machines. He had to get up and work again. As the second sleepless night was about to end, he suddenly felt dizzy and saw stars. He knew he couldn't go on like this, so he got up and, leaning against the wall, slowly made his way to the bed. As soon as he lay down, he coughed violently, as if his internal organs were about to come out. He quickly grabbed a toothbrush cup from the bedside. When it was light, Ma looked up at the bedside and saw that the cup was filled with half a cup of blood!

The leaders, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered him to the hospital for a check-up. The test results showed that his white blood cell count was over 30,000! The young female doctor widened her eyes and said, "Young man, why didn't you come earlier?"

"The construction site really can't do without me," Ma said, blushing. "Doctor, please give me some medicine, I have to rush back."

"Nonsense! You must stay in the hospital for treatment. Otherwise, you'll be done for at this young age!" The doctor said, then had him "escorted" into the ward and immediately called the construction site command center.

A sunny day. Blue sky. This is the famous summer resort of Gulangyu Island in Xiamen. While people were joyfully rushing to the sea, the blue waves had lost their last charm for Wang Youting.

In March 1989, the waterproofing and sealing project of the Dapu Road Tunnel was successfully completed. Given that Director Wang, who had been on the construction site since his discharge, was exhausted and could no longer bear the strain, the academy specially arranged for him and his wife to go to Gulangyu Island for a rest. But how could Wang Youting rest? He thought of the upcoming projects in Beijing, Wuhan, and other places, the national waterproofing academic exchange conference to be held in Wuxi, and the soldier Ma Delin, who was still under observation and treatment at the academy's health department. Before his leave was up, he hurriedly boarded the northbound train.

Hearing that Director Wang was about to return, I was interviewing and waiting at the academy for five days. But in the end, what I waited for was only Director Wang's wife, Zhao Duoluan. Old Zhao said that when the train arrived in Shanghai, Director Wang got off the train alone. He went to the Dapu Road Tunnel again.

Due to official duties, I left Xuzhou with great regret at not having seen Director Wang. For some reason, on the way back to Beijing, I suddenly thought of the legendary Great Yu, who spent his life struggling with floods. Oh, in our vast and ancient country, there are indeed those who have gone before and those who will come after.

    循着水的踪迹〔报告文学〕
    刘立云
    水既温柔而又无情。
    自从人类建筑起庇护自己的生存空间，水就开始无孔不入无缝不钻地突破他们筑起的防线，对生命造成严重的威胁。
    这何况是在中国多雨的南方，何况是在临江临海的上海，更何况是在静卧于上海黄浦江底已经整整19年的打浦路越江隧道里！
    水、水、水……这是不该出现水的地方！可呈现在总工程师王友亭面前的，却处处是水。长达2367米的打浦路隧道始建于1965年，通车于1970年。近20年来，由于隧道的江中段和江岸段的沉降不均和月通车近17万辆的长期动载作用等等原因，已导致隧洞变形、环煤砂浆防水接缝开裂，渗漏水日趋严重。早在1977年，有关方面仅在隧道的上风道和下风道就测出漏水点474个。1982年再次测试，发现日渗水量已达242.33立方米！隧道的全面抢修已势在必行。
    1988年9月，王友亭所在的解放军徐州工程兵指挥学院联合上海隧道工程公司、海洋地质局和洛阳工程兵第三研究所一举中标。10月，由王友亭挂帅的防水大军率先开进了工地。
    每天照耀着的太阳，忽然从头顶消失了。
    隧道里粉尘弥漫，灯光暗若萤火，三步开外看不见人影。侧墙后积下的灰尘厚达数寸，细如精粉，钢钎和大锤一碰，呼地腾起一片黑雾。黑雾里夹带着车辆排出的大量废气，刺眼呛鼻直扑肺叶。咳嗽声此起彼伏。
    敲开侧墙板，清理出工作面，眼前的情景让大家惊呆了：隧道四周密布着几十根高压电线，最高的达1200伏。由于长年失修，高压线不时跳出一簇簇火花……
    刚过三天，工地上传来一个惊人的消息：特从农村招来的200多个民工，一夜之间逃跑了28个！他们连工资也不要便不辞而别了。
    苦，确实很苦。由于白天要保证正常通车，全部工程都必须在晚上进行。又正是燥热过后的初秋，小伙子们谁不想睡觉？可险恶的工作环境和繁重的切割工序，容不得半点疏忽。请来的民工可以卷起铺盖一走了之，军人们只有一种选择：不倒下就得战斗下去，直至胜利。
      “放心吧，天塌下来我们顶！”练习营营长周宝林往指挥部的办公桌上重重撂下一句话，蹬上长统靴连夜钻进了坑道。他把分散在民工队里的战士全部集合起来，重新组织了一个尖刀班，说：“弟兄们，我们没有任何退路，只有背水一战！”
    隧道里顿时机声大作，几十台切割机响成一片，像天空正飞过一个轰炸机群。向前推进是异常艰难的。上风道和下风道都是半圆形，往高处切还能直起腰，往低处切割就只能趴在地下。几条槽打下来，切割手们全身扭得无处不酸痛。而且切割时砂石粉尘漫天飞扬，戴着九层纱布的口罩也抵挡不住。
    “哎哟！”尖刀队长邵永波扛着切割机，顶着黑蒙蒙的尘雾刚要转移，小腿被戳出的一段钢筋扎了一道5寸多长的伤口，鲜血流了一裤腿。为转移伤口的疼痛，他从卫生员手里接过一条绷带，把血口勒住，马上又抱起切割机朝漏水点切下去。下班时，他刚想迈步，受伤的腿麻木得再也挪不动了。两个战士搀着他，一瘸一拐地走出隧道。
    湖北籍副班长郑宗富，忽然接到一封“父亲病危”的电报。组织上批准他回到家乡后，身患咽喉癌的父亲已奄奄一息。父亲见儿子回来了，脸上露出了凄恻的笑：“儿啊，能最后见上你一面，我心满意足了。你马上回队伍上去吧，我死后，你也不要再回来了。”
    小郑回到上海不久，父亲便去世了。正在隧道里打风钻的小郑听到消息，直流眼泪。领导安慰他说：“小郑，回去收拾收拾，明天赶回家去为父亲送葬吧。”小郑抹去泪水，平静地说：“不，上次回去，父亲就过意不去了。这次，我决不能违背他生前的愿望。”说完，抱起风钻又干起来，泪水和汗水在脸上流出两条晶亮的小溪……
    走出隧道，突然出现在王友亭眼前的是一个光怪陆离的世界：湛蓝的天空上金蜂飞舞，沿街的楼房左右摇晃，满街花花绿绿的人影如一片片热带鱼，在水里轻轻漫游……顷刻间，他感到自己被一个汹涌的大浪吞没了，沉重的躯体正不由自主地向无底的深渊滑下去。
    “王总！王总！你怎么啦？怎么啦？”随行人员见总工程师脸色蜡黄，呼吸急促，连忙把他扶进吉普车，送进医院。
    王友亭实在太累了。早在1959年他在太原工学院上学时，就参加了北京人民大会堂的防水设计和研究。60年代初，他被派到莫斯科和列宁格勒等大城市进行防水考察。北京十三陵地下宫殿刚一发掘，他便一头扎进还散发着古尸浊气的墓穴，积累了中国古代防水的许多资料。在以后的岁月里，他先后参加了黄河隧道、核爆炸模拟器试验等10余项重大工程和科研课题的研究。由于他双脚在水里泡得太久，早已患下了严重的风湿性关节炎，走起路来一摇一晃，踉踉跄跄。两个月前，他一阵晕眩，栽倒在自家的厕所里。可学院卫生所还未查出病因，他就带着工程技术人员上了打浦路隧道。
    就在昨天，他顶着能将人吹跑的冷风，由人搀扶着钻进了隧道的上风道和下风道。他对已经剔好槽的抢修点，一环一环进行勘察。再根据每一环的渗漏水情况，从材料配方到施工要求上制订出具体的堵漏方案。防水堵漏工程“三分技术，七分操作”，任何一个细小环节都不容忽视，都必须亲自到场。
    在下风道里，有一地段积水较深，给他的勘察带来许多困难。随行的技术人员准备代替他，可他怎么也不同意，说着就往泥水里踩。他们只好把他背起来从泥水里一步步勘察过去。
    这一夜，王友亭不停地在隧道里转悠。
    王总工程师突然病倒的消息传回指挥部，立即把坐镇在这里的学院副院长徐新江少将和院务部领导赵金根上校急坏了。他们当即赶往医院。
    正在输液的王友亭，见院领导和同志们围在身边，两眼湿润了。他紧紧拉着徐副院长的手说：“回去吧，你们都回到工地上去吧！工程已到高潮，马虎不得啊！”又对一直跟随着他的工程师任武现说：“下步堵漏，全靠你了。请立即把防水大专班的几个尖子调来，让他们同你把好技术关……”
    任工程师热泪盈眶：“你放心住院吧。你的心，快为工地操碎了……”任工刚刚看到了检查结果，王总患的是心脏病、脑隔膜囊肿和早搏迸发症！如不及时抢救，后果不可设想……
    马德林又一天一夜没合眼了。
    工程正转入注浆和嵌缝阶段。这是采取封闭的办法，用注浆泵往防水槽里注入调成液态的聚氨脂嵌缝膏。嵌缝膏注入后遇上渗漏水便几十倍地膨胀，最终把裂缝堵得滴水不漏。这套工序要求操作迅疾，稍一耽搁，嵌缝膏就会在注浆泵注浆管里膨胀、堵塞。注浆机使用过后，每天都得及时清洗。
    清洗注浆机的任务落在北京籍战士马德林身上。小马刚刚独自完成修理切割机的任务，为学院节省了上万元修理费。一听说要派专人清洗注浆机，他又把活揽了过来。清洗注浆机所用的二甲苯，是一种有毒的化学材料，它在很强的挥发过程中，通过皮肤上的毛孔和呼吸道侵入人体。时间一长，即会导致血液中毒。为保证注浆顺利进行，小马什么也顾不上了。
    注浆机源源不断地从工地上送来，马德林不分昼夜地忙碌着。尽管戴着厚厚的口罩，浓烈而呛人的气味依然钻进鼻翼，直逼胸膛，搞得他五脏翻腾，头晕眼花，整天昏昏沉沉。
    此刻已是清晨5点，四周静悄悄的，小马躺在床上辗转反侧，怎么也睡不着。他只觉得四肢棉花般地软绵绵的，大脑轰轰作响。
    头天晚上，马德林从10点一直忙到凌晨3点，好容易把积压下来的13台机器洗出来6台，人就感到支持不住了。没躺下多久，下班的人群又送来了十几台。他只好爬起来再干。在第二个不眠之夜将要结束时，顿觉天昏地转，眼冒星光。他知道再这样蛮干下去不行了，就起来贴着墙壁，慢慢向床铺摸去。刚一躺下，就爆发出一阵剧烈的咳嗽，仿佛连五脏六腑都要吐出来。他连忙摸出床头的一只漱牙缸。天亮了，小马抬头往床头一看，牙缸里装着的竟是半缸子血！
    领导得知这一消息，当即强令他上医院作检查。化验结果，白血球达30000多！年轻的女主治医生瞪大着眼睛看着他：“小同志，怎么不早来？”
      “工地实在离不开啊，”小马红着脸，喃喃地说：“医生，请给开点药，我得马上赶回去。”
    “胡闹！你得老老实实地住院治疗。否则年轻轻的，这就完了！”说完，女医生把他“押”进了病房，接着要通了工地指挥部的电话。
    丽日。蓝天。这是中外驰名的避暑胜地厦门鼓浪屿。当人们雀跃着扑向大海的时候，那蔚蓝色的波涛，对王友亭已失去了最后的魅力。
    1989年3月，打浦路隧道的防水堵漏工程胜利竣工了。鉴于出院后一直坚持在工地上的王总已心力交瘁，疲惫不堪，学院特地安排他夫妇去鼓浪屿疗养。可王友亭又怎能疗养得下去呢？！他想到了在北京、武汉等地接踵而来的工程，想到了即将在无锡召开的全国防水学术交流年会，想到了至今仍在学院卫生所观察治疗的吐血战士马德林，假期未满，就匆匆登上了北去的列车。
    听说王总就要回来，我在学院边采访边等待，一直等了5天。可最后等到的，只是王总的老伴赵多銮。老赵说，车到上海，王总便独自下车了。他去的又是打浦路隧道。
    因公务在身，我带着未见上王总一面的极大遗憾离开了徐州。不知为什么，在返京的路上我忽然想起了传说中的那个为治水而奔波一生的大禹。哦，在我们这个历史悠久的泱泱大国，可谓前有古人，后有来者。
