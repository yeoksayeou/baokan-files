The special Arab summit held in Casablanca, Morocco, at the end of May made a positive contribution to promoting the Middle East peace process. The summit confirmed the principles and foundations of the Middle East peace plan established by the 1982 Fez Arab summit; for the first time, it acknowledged United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338; it supported the convening of an international Middle East peace conference attended by the five permanent members of the Security Council and the relevant parties to the conflict; and it established a higher Arab committee headed by King Hassan to handle international relations, promote the peace process, and participate in the preparation of the international conference. This was another important Arab summit since the Fez summit, and its resolutions went a step further than those of the Fez summit.

The new achievements made by Arab countries in promoting the Middle East peace process are not accidental; they are the product of the changing situation in the Middle East.

For a period, the PLO, relying on the uprising of the people in the occupied territories, adopted a series of flexible and realistic measures and actively launched a diplomatic offensive. In mid-November last year, the 19th special session of the Palestine National Council made major adjustments to the PLO's struggle strategy and tactics, announcing the establishment of the State of Palestine. Subsequently, the PLO began dialogue with the United States. At the same time, the PLO worked hard to win over Western European countries. Not long ago, Arafat visited France and announced that the 1964 PLO Charter had become outdated. Regarding Israeli Prime Minister Shamir's proposal for elections in the occupied territories, the PLO exposed Israel's intention to use elections to undermine the people's uprising and eliminate the PLO's representative status, while also taking the shell of elections and insisting on Israeli withdrawal and international supervision as preconditions, linking it to the final settlement. This demonstrated both firm principles and high flexibility. The PLO's proactive actions to promote the political settlement of the Palestinian issue have advanced the Middle East peace process, enhanced the PLO's status, and gained broad support from the international community. At the Casablanca Arab summit, the PLO's peace line was endorsed by the attending leaders, which will be a strong support for the PLO's future struggle.

The international community has given due attention to the Middle East and Palestinian issues, and relevant parties have been adjusting their Middle East policies. The United States and the PLO have held three rounds of dialogue, touching on some substantive issues. The United States no longer excludes the PLO as a negotiating party, advocates direct dialogue between Israel and the PLO, and proposes the implementation of Security Council Resolution 242, land for peace, guaranteeing the legitimate rights of the Palestinians, and ensuring Israel's security as four principles for solving the Middle East problem. President Bush proposed convening an international conference with an appropriate structure at an appropriate time and advocated that Israel end its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. This marks a beginning of change in the United States' stance on the Middle East issue. The Soviet Union actively promotes the peaceful resolution of the Middle East issue. The Soviet Union, on the one hand, supports the PLO's peace line, and on the other hand, continues to ease relations with Israel, advocating direct negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis. At the same time, the Soviet Union strongly advocates convening an international Middle East peace conference and has put forward some specific suggestions for this purpose. Western European countries also seek to directly participate in the Middle East peace process. Western European countries, to varying degrees, have adjusted their policies toward the PLO, for the first time acknowledging the PLO's full authority to participate in the Middle East peace process, inviting Arafat to visit, supporting an international conference under the auspices of the United Nations, and advocating direct dialogue between Palestinians and Israelis within the framework of the international conference. Western European countries have become an important factor that cannot be ignored in promoting the Middle East peace process.

As the call for Middle East talks grows louder and the struggle of the people in the occupied territories deepens, Israel's rigid stance has also begun to show signs of relaxation. Peace forces within Israel have been growing, from grassroots organizations to those with official colors. The Labor Party insists on its stance of talks. Some Israeli officials have publicly expressed their willingness to engage in direct talks with Arab countries under the auspices of the United Nations and have indicated their willingness to recognize the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people.

The Israeli Intelligence Agency and the Strategic Research Center of the University of Jaffa have proposed that the Israeli government engage in direct talks with the PLO. Some Israeli official agencies have even proposed the establishment of a non-military Palestinian state in the occupied territories. Under the pressure of the changing situation and domestic and international pressures, Shamir had to express that Israel would withdraw from part of the occupied territories and allow free elections for Palestinians in the occupied areas.

The Middle East issue has shown new developments favorable to a political settlement, and the wheel of the Middle East peace process is no longer turning in place. The Palestinian issue, which has lasted for 40 years, has shown prospects for a peaceful settlement. However, the final resolution of the Middle East issue still faces many difficulties and obstacles. Israel still holds a stubborn stance on major substantive issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the United States' pro-Israeli stance has not undergone substantial changes. There are still significant differences in the positions and proposals of the relevant parties. Whether the wheel of Middle East talks can continue to roll forward will depend on whether the international community and the relevant conflicting parties, especially Israel and the United States, continue to make efforts and add new impetus to the Middle East peace process.

    中东和平的新进展
    时涧
    5月底在摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡举行的阿拉伯特别首脑会议，对推动中东和平进程作出了积极贡献。会议确认1982年非斯阿拉伯首脑会议所确立的中东和平计划各项原则和基础；第一次承认联合国安理会242号和338号决议；支持召开安理会5个常任理事国和有关冲突各方参加的中东和平国际会议；成立以哈桑国王为首的阿拉伯最高委员会，负责进行国际联系，推动和平进程，参与筹备国际会议。这是继非斯会议后又一次重要的阿拉伯国家首脑会议，它通过的决议比非斯会议又前进了一步。
    阿拉伯国家在推动中东和平进程中所取得的新成果并不是偶然的，它是中东形势发展变化的产物。
    一段时期以来，巴解以被占领土人民起义斗争为依托，采取一系列灵活现实做法，积极发动外交攻势。去年11月中旬，巴勒斯坦全国委员会第19次特别会议对巴解斗争战略和策略作了重大调整，宣布成立巴勒斯坦国。之后，巴解与美国开始对话。与此同时，巴解大力做西欧国家的工作。不久前，阿拉法特访问法国，宣布巴解1964年宪章已经过时。对以色列总理沙米尔提出的关于被占领土选举计划，巴解既揭穿了以色列旨在通过选举瓦解人民起义、取消巴解代表权的企图，又接过选举的外壳，坚持以色列撤军和国际监督为前提条件并与最终解决相联系的内核，体现了坚定的原则性和高度的灵活性。巴解为促进巴勒斯坦问题政治解决所采取的主动行动，推动了中东和平进程，提高了巴解地位，获得国际社会的广泛支持。在卡萨布兰卡阿拉伯特别首脑会议上，巴解的和平路线得到了与会首脑的首肯，这对巴解今后的斗争是一有力支持。
    国际社会对中东问题和巴勒斯坦问题给予了应有的关注，有关各方都在调整其中东政策。美国与巴解已举行了三轮对话，涉及到一些实质性问题。美国不再排除巴解作为谈判的一方，主张以色列与巴解直接对话，并提出执行安理会242号决议、以土地换和平、保障巴勒斯坦合法权利和保障以色列安全作为解决中东问题的四项原则。布什总统提出在适当时机召开适当结构的国际会议，并主张以色列结束对约旦河西岸、加沙的占领。这标志着美国对中东问题的立场开始有所变化。苏联积极推动中东问题的和平解决。苏联一方面支持巴解的和平路线，另一方面继续松动与以色列的关系，主张巴、以对立双方直接谈判。与此同时，苏联极力主张召开中东和平国际会议，并为此提出一些具体建议。西欧国家也力图直接参与中东和平进程。西欧各国不同程度地调整对巴解政策，首次承认巴解有全权参加中东和平进程，纷纷邀请阿拉法特访问，支持在联合国主持下的中东和会，提出在国际会议框架内实现巴、以直接对话的主张。西欧国家已成为推动中东和平进程一个不可忽视的重要因素。
    随着中东和谈呼声的不断高涨和被占领土人民斗争的深入发展，以色列的僵硬立场也开始有所松动。以色列国内和平力量不断壮大，从民间组织发展到具有官方色彩。工党坚持其和谈主张。以色列一些要员公开表示愿在联合国参与下与阿拉伯国家进行直接谈判，并表示准备承认巴勒斯坦人民合法权利。
    以色列情报局、雅法大学战略研究中心提出以色列政府与巴解进行直接谈判的主张。有的以色列官方机构甚至提出在被占领土建立非军事性质的巴勒斯坦国。迫于形势的发展变化和国内外的压力，沙米尔不得不表示以色列将撤出部分被占领土，并允许以占区巴勒斯坦人进行自由选举。
    中东问题出现了有利于政治解决的新变化，中东和平进程的车轮不再就地空转，持续40年之久的巴勒斯坦问题出现了和平解决的前景。但中东问题的最终解决仍面临许多困难和障碍，以色列对阿以冲突中的重大实质问题仍持顽固立场，美国偏袒以色列的立场也未发生实质性变化，有关各方的立场和主张仍有较大差距。中东和谈的车轮能否不停顿地向前滚动，将取决于国际社会和有关冲突各方，特别是以色列和美国，是否继续做出努力，为中东和平进程增加新的推动力。
