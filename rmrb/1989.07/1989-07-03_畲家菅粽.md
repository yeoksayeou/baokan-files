The Dragon Boat Festival arrives like a lively child, bringing with it strings of dumplings. Han Chinese families wrap dumplings in bamboo leaves, making them pointed and four-sided, tied with tough grass in the middle, like a young girl's corset...

The She ethnic group's Dragon Boat Festival dumplings are made from reed leaves. The reed leaves are as wide as a palm and three feet long, wrapped into long cylindrical reed dumplings, like a corn cob full of a bountiful harvest. The bright green reed leaves wrap around the plump dumpling, heavy and giving a sense of a rich harvest. The She people are hospitable, and during the Dragon Boat Festival, they wrap various reed dumplings to give to relatives and friends, using the tightly wrapped reed dumplings to symbolize the enduring bond of friendship. Every year when the Dragon Boat Festival comes, you can see She women dressed in vibrant traditional clothing, carrying baskets full of reed dumplings, walking from house to house in the village, on the streets, and in the alleys, looking content and at ease. Especially the She girls, with their beautiful phoenix hairstyles, wearing embroidered clothes with lace trim, and colorful sashes around their waists, carrying reed dumplings on a small shoulder pole, their graceful figures are a sight to behold.

This time, I tasted the reed dumplings again. It was at the home of a newly acquainted old cadre. On the wall of the hall, there hung a large string of reed dumplings. The reed leaves were bright green, as if still carrying the dew and mist from the mountains.

The old man laughed heartily, "Come, try these She family reed dumplings!"

His elegant daughter immediately objected, "What era is this? Still proud to serve grass dumplings to guests? It's better to have these Hong Kong almond toffees!"

I quickly said, "I really want to try them!"

"The taste of these reed dumplings is truly something to savor..." The old man, hearing my words, seemed to have found a kindred spirit, his face flushed with joy. He took down a few reed dumplings from the wall and instructed his daughter to heat them up in the kitchen.

The daughter pouted, "Dad, a few grass dumplings, you treat them like treasures, aren't you embarrassed..."

"You don't understand, this is someone's heartfelt gift!" The old man gave his daughter a stern look. His eyes, already wrinkled, suddenly shone with a glow of remembrance, like the evening sea, rippling with waves of memory...

28 years ago, he was still a young and energetic cadre, sent to work in a She village called Ku Chai. At that time, the winds of exaggeration had just blown through, the land was barren, and the seeds had been eaten... Facing the famine, he reflected painfully and boldly took the initiative to secretly distribute land to households, and also found ways to bring in cabbage seeds and rice seeds to help Ku Chai Village produce and save themselves. Later, when he was transferred for punishment, Ku Chai Village had already recovered from the disaster

    畲家菅粽
    孔屏
    端午节像快活的伢子，晃动着一串串粽子匆匆来了。汉族人家包粽子，天南地北一个样：竹叶包成尖尖四角，用韧草紧扎中间，像少女的束腰……
    畲族兄弟端午节包的是菅粽。菅草的叶子巴掌宽，3尺长，用它包成长筒形的菅粽，像一个个丰年的玉米棒子。那碧绿的菅叶，包着胀满满的粽团，沉甸甸的，给人一种丰收的厚重感。畲家好客，端午节都要包各种菅粽送亲友，借菅粽扎得牢连得紧，以示亲友情谊的牢靠。每年端午节一到，村路上、大街头、小巷里，到处可以看到畲家妇女穿着色彩鲜艳的民族服装，拎着装满菅粽的精致竹篮，怡然自得地走家串门。特别是那些畲家少女，梳着漂亮的凤凰髻，身穿镶花边的绣花衣，腰扎五彩带，用小扁担挑着玉绿色的菅粽，悠悠身影别有风采。
    这一回，我又品尝了菅粽的味道。那是在一位新认识的老干部家里，厅堂壁上，挂着一大串菅粽，包粽的菅草叶绿莹莹的，似乎还带着山野的露珠和岚气。
    老人家爽朗地笑道：“来，尝尝这畲家的菅粽！”
    他那风姿袅娜的女儿马上反对说：“都什么时代了，还好意思拿草粽招待客人？还是吃这香港的酒心软糖吧！”
    我连忙说：“我还真想尝尝！”
    “这菅粽的滋味，真够人咂吧的……”老人家听了我的话，像遇到知己，高兴得满脸泛红。他从壁上扯下几个菅粽，吩咐娇女儿下厨去热一热。
    娇女儿撇撇嘴说：“爸，几个草粽，你当宝贝供着，不嫌寒碜……”
    “你哪里知道，这是人家的一片心意！”老人狠狠“剜”了女儿一眼，那双已被皱纹网住的老眼，倏地像傍晚的海面，泛起了一片回忆的波光……
    28年前，他还是个浑身朝气的青年干部，被派到一个叫苦菅寨的畲村去工作。那时，浮夸的狂风刚刮过，土地荒了，种子也吃光了……面对着饥荒，他痛苦地反思着，终于放胆自作主张，暗暗分田到户，还想方设法调来白菜种和稻麦种，帮助苦菅村生产自救。后来，他因此受处分调离时，苦菅村已度过灾荒回了春，家家户户用新收获的糯米包了菅粽，送他离去……从此，每到端午节，苦菅村家家户户都给他送菅粽，他也回赠些畲家所喜欢的冰糖、红枣，两相来往，比亲戚还亲。
      “我不过是凭良心做了一点事，乡亲们就一直记在心……”老人激动地踱着步。
    这时，娇女儿把热过的菅粽端来了。解开那绿莹莹的菅叶，我的两眼不由得一亮：哦，这不像米粽，简直是一件珠联玉缀的工艺品！畲家的糯米，粒粒如珍珠般洁白、饱满；粽里有畲家特产的“御豆”，像是镶嵌着的白玉……
