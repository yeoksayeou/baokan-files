Yunnan Province will swiftly break through 10 major cases that seriously harm the construction of clean government. This was decided at the recently concluded provincial discipline inspection work conference.

At the meeting, more than 130 major and important cases were listed, and it was decided to prioritize breaking through more than 70 cases. Of these, 10 cases will be handled by the province, while the remaining more than 60 cases will be handled by various cities, prefectures, and municipalities.

The cases referred to as "tigers" and "hard nuts" not only involve huge amounts of state assets being embezzled, but also implicate more than 20 leaders at the level of prefecture and department heads and above. The criminals engaged in extensive exchanges of money and power, weaving a dense network of relationships, making the cases extremely complex and difficult to investigate. Many cases have been dragged on for a long time without resolution.

To break through these cases, a strong leadership team headed by Provincial Party Secretary Pu Chaozhu was established. The team includes personnel from the discipline inspection, supervision, commerce, auditing, and judicial departments, who will study each case individually. Additionally, a group of experienced comrades from the advisory committee and other departments have been assigned to assist in the investigations. The meeting decided that for each key case, a leader, investigation team, plan, and time limit must be designated. These "four designations" must be reported to the higher-level discipline inspection committee for record-keeping and supervision.

The sixth plenary session of the Communist Party of Heilongjiang Province, which concluded on July 12, decided that all levels of party and government agencies in the province will not build new office buildings for three years, will not purchase high-end office supplies, will not buy imported cars when updating vehicles, and will turn in excess vehicles for storage.

The meeting also announced that the leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial Advisory Committee, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Discipline Inspection Committee will eat at local government canteens when visiting the grassroots level, and will not have a special "four dishes and one soup" prepared for them.

In response to these requirements, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee decided to strengthen the audit system for leading cadres upon their departure from office. Those who engaged in extravagance and waste, burdened the people, and caused losses during their tenure must be strictly held accountable.

    云南省决定尽快查处十件大案  黑龙江各机关三年不建办公楼
    新华社昆明7月14日电  （记者罗苹）云南省将尽快突破10件严重危害廉政建设的“老虎案”、“骨头案”，这是日前结束的省纪检工作会议确定的。
    这次会上，共排列出130多件大案要案，确定首批重点突破70余件。除10件由省里负责外，其余60余件由各地、州、市查处。
    被称为“老虎”、“骨头”的这批案件，不仅侵吞国家资财的数额巨大，而且牵涉地、厅级以上领导干部20余人，案犯大搞金钱与权力交易，编织了严密的关系网，使案情错综复杂，查处极难，不少案件久拖不结。
    为了突破这批案件，由省委书记普朝柱挂帅，成立了强有力的机构，把纪检、监察、工商、审计、政法等部门的人员组织起来，逐案研究，同时，从顾委等部门抽调了一批富有工作经验的老同志帮助办案。会议决定，每个重点案件都要定领导、定办案人员、定方案、定时限，“四定”计划要报上一级纪委备案，以便逐级检查落实。
    新华社哈尔滨7月14日电  （记者张持坚）12日结束的中共黑龙江省六届三次全会决定，全省各级党政机关3年内不新建办公楼，不添置高档办公用品，车辆更新时不购进口车，超编车辆上交封存。
    会议还宣布，省委、省人大常委会、省政府、省顾委、省政协、省纪委的领导成员下基层，一律到当地机关食堂用餐，不得单独为他们做“四菜一汤”。
    和这些要求相呼应，黑龙江省委决定强化领导干部离职审计制度，对在职时有铺张浪费、劳民伤财、造成损失的，必须严查其责任。
