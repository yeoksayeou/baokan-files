Today in the afternoon at Zhongnanhai's Ziguangge, Premier Li Peng met with the Indian delegation led by Foreign Secretary Singh, who came to participate in the first round of talks and vice-ministerial consultations of the Sino-Indian Border Joint Working Group.

Li Peng said that last year, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi successfully visited China, and with the joint efforts of both sides, the relationship between the two countries has developed. He hoped that this process could continue. He said that it is in the interest of the peoples of both countries for China and India to further improve and develop their relations. Both China and India are major countries in Asia and neighbors, so it is important for the two countries to further improve and develop their relations, not only because they are in Asia but also because they have many similarities. Both countries bear important responsibilities for the stability of the situation in Asia. He expressed that the Chinese government is willing to continue to improve and develop relations with India on the basis of the achievements of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China.

Singh said that the Indian delegation, in accordance with the spirit of the agreement reached by the two prime ministers last year, had successful talks and consultations, and both sides were satisfied with the results. He also conveyed a message from Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to Premier Li Peng, hoping to strengthen cooperation between the two countries in the economic field and other areas, and at the same time, looking forward to Premier Li Peng's visit to India at any convenient time. Premier Li Peng expressed his thanks for this.

When talking about the domestic situation, Premier Li Peng briefly introduced the situation of China's suppression of the turmoil and quelling of the counter-revolutionary riot. He said that China has achieved significant victories in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, and now the situation in Beijing and the rest of the country has stabilized.

He said that the recently convened Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee elected Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Party, forming a new leadership collective with him as the core. Li Peng expressed his belief that under the guidance of the policies set by the Fourth Plenary Session, China can overcome temporary difficulties and do a better job in all areas of work.

    李鹏会见印度代表团时说
    希望中印关系进一步发展
    本报北京7月4日讯　记者孙毅报道：今天下午在中南海紫光阁，国务院总理李鹏会见了前来参加中印边界联合工作小组首轮会谈和副外长级磋商的印度外事秘书辛格率领的印度代表团。
    李鹏说，去年拉·甘地总理对中国进行了成功的访问，在双方共同努力下，两国关系有了发展，希望这个进程能够继续进行下去。他说，中印两国进一步改善和发展关系，符合两国人民的利益。中印两国都是亚洲大国，又是近邻，两国进一步改善和发展关系很重要，不仅因为两国共处亚洲，而且有着许多相似的地方，两国对亚洲局势的稳定都负有重要的责任。他表示中国政府愿意在拉·甘地总理访华取得成果的基础上继续改善和发展两国关系。
    辛格表示，印中两国代表团根据去年两国总理达成的协议精神进行了成功的会谈和磋商，双方对此都表示满意。他还向李鹏总理转达了拉·甘地总理的口信，希望加强两国在经济方面和其它方面的合作，同时期待着李鹏总理在任何方便的时候访问印度。李鹏总理对此表示感谢。
    在谈到国内形势时，李鹏总理向客人简要介绍了我国制止动乱、平息暴乱的情况。他说，中国平息反革命暴乱已经取得了重大胜利，现在北京和全国的局势已趋于稳定。
    他说，最近召开的党的十三届四中全会选举江泽民为党的总书记，组成了以他为核心的新的领导集体。李鹏表示相信，在四中全会所确定的方针指导下，中国能够克服暂时困难，把各项工作做得更好。
