In the remote and inconveniently located Longbiao Mountain area of southern Guizhou, there is only one river, the ? River, connecting it to the outside world. The Pavilion of Elegance, a typical ancient Chinese wooden structure, stands by the ? River. Unlike the Leifeng Pagoda in Hangzhou, which is known for its height, this pavilion has only two stories. Its exterior, while ancient and elegant, does not seem to have any particularly attractive features. However, as I climbed the narrow wooden stairs to the top and looked around, the undulating mountains stretched out before me, giving me a sense of overlooking the entire landscape. The ? River, flowing from the north, seemed like a golden serpent winding through the mountains under the scorching sun, meandering towards the horizon. In this wonderful and magical moment, I seemed to see a solitary sailboat approaching me. On the bow, there was a thin and lonely ancient poet named Wang Changling, reciting the verses he had long held in his heart: “The vast river flows wide, the rain clears to reveal autumn. The post station is on a high bank, looking out to the end of the reed islet. The water merges with the Five Rivers, my heart longs for a journey of ten thousand miles…”

It was mid-summer, and the sun was shining fiercely. Thinking of the poet's experiences, my heart could not calm down. His border poems are grand and uplifting, filled with deep affection for the country's rivers and mountains. Indeed, every blade of grass and tree is dear to him. Among them, his praise of the lotus reaches a very high level:

	“The lotus leaf skirt is cut from one color,
	The lotus blossoms open on both sides of the face.
	Lost in the pool, it cannot be seen,
	Only when hearing the song does one realize someone is coming…”

It is said that during the seven years Wang Changling lived in the Pavilion of Elegance, it was with the support of a virtuous woman named Fu Rong that he was able to devote time to the administrative affairs of Longbiao, working day and night. Longbiao has always been a place where the Miao, Han, and Tujia ethnic groups live together. In the poet's heart, harmony among the ethnic groups was of utmost importance. It was out of this consideration that he once convened scholars from all directions at the Pavilion of Elegance to discuss the great plan for ethnic unity.

People told me that the real Pavilion of Elegance where Wang Changling once lived no longer exists. The pavilion I see now is a reconstruction by later generations to commemorate this patriotic poet. For some reason, I also feel that it is built in a certain sense for that kind and virtuous woman, Fu Rong. In Wang Changling's turbulent life, Fu Rong was like his comfort. I stood for a long time by the lotus pond in front of the Pavilion of Elegance, and I saw a remaining lotus flower blooming, as if the spirit of Fu Rong was still cherishing the memory of this persecuted poet…

    黔南有座芙蓉楼
    郑清源
    交通不便地处黔南的龙标山区，仅有一条?水通向外界，与广袤的世界相联。芙蓉楼，一座典型的中国古代木制建筑，就耸立在?水河畔。不像杭州的六和塔那样以高取胜，她只有上下两层，外观除了古香古色，看不出有什么特别诱人之处。然而，当我沿着那狭窄的木楼梯登楼四望时，起伏绵亘的群山尽收眼底，大有一览群山小的气概；那自北而来的?水，也好似成了一条在烈日下潆洄群山的金蛇，悠悠然游向远方。就在这美妙而神奇的瞬间，我仿佛看见一片孤帆向我驶来，前舷处，一位叫王昌龄的古代孤独清瘦的诗人正吟诵着他那久蓄心中的诗句：“莽莽江势阔，雨开得阳秋。驿门是高岸，望尽黄芦洲。水与五溪合，心期万里游……”这位两次被谪的唐代诗人一口气把从江宁经九江沿途积蓄起来的全部情感倾吐了出来。
    这时正是仲夏时节，太阳尽情施展了它的威力。想起诗人的经历，我的心怎么也平静不下来。他的边塞诗气势雄浑，格调高昂，凝聚着对祖国山河的挚爱，真可谓一草一木总关情。其间，对芙蓉的赞美达到了很高的境界：
  “荷叶罗裙一色裁，芙蓉向脸两边开。乱入池中看不见，闻歌始觉有人来……”据说，王昌龄在芙蓉楼的七年间，就是靠了一位叫芙蓉女的贤慧女子的扶持，才得以腾出时间为龙标的政事而日夜奔波、操劳的。龙标自古就是苗、汉、土家族杂居的地方。在诗人的心里，各民族间的和睦相处是至关重要的。正是出于这样的考虑，他曾在芙蓉楼上召集过八方贤士，共商民族团结的大计。
    人们告诉我，王昌龄曾经在这里生活过的真实的芙蓉楼早已不复存在了。我现在所见到的这座芙蓉楼是后人为了纪念这位爱国诗人重新修建的。不知为什么，我还觉得它在某种意义上也是为那位善良的芙蓉女修建的。在王昌龄动荡不安的一生中，芙蓉女不啻是他的慰藉。我久久地立在芙蓉楼前的芙蓉池旁，我看见一朵残存的芙蓉花正在开放，仿佛就是的芙蓉女亡灵还在缅怀着这位蒙难的诗人……
