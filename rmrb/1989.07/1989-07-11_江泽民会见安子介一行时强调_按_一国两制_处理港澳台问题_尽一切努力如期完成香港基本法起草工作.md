Jiang Zemin Meets with Anzi Jie and Others, Emphasizes Handling Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan Issues Under "One Country, Two Systems," and Strives to Complete the Drafting of Hong Kong Basic Law on Time

New China News Agency, Beijing, July 11 - This afternoon, CCP Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with Anzi Jie, Vice Chairman of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Drafting Committee and Chairman of the Basic Law Consultative Committee, Vice Chairman of the Basic Law Consultative Committee Luo Dezeng, and Basic Law Drafting Committee member Wong Po-hin, and other prominent figures from Hong Kong at Zhongnanhai.

Jiang Zemin told the guests that resolving the Hong Kong issue using the "One Country, Two Systems" policy is not just a diplomatic necessity but is in the fundamental interests of Hong Kong and the entire country. This approach benefits Hong Kong, the entire country, as well as Britain and other countries.

Jiang Zemin said that in handling the issues of Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, we adopt the "One Country, Two Systems" policy. We will build our socialism, and you will build your capitalism. "Each to their own," we will not impose socialism on Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, and you should not bring your capitalist system to the mainland.

When discussing international relations, Jiang Zemin said that we have always advocated for peaceful coexistence among countries with different systems based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

Jiang Zemin told the guests that when he was in Shanghai, he had told visiting foreign businessmen that our economic cooperation with foreign friends has three principles: first, mutual understanding to build mutual trust; second, mutual benefit, allowing foreign investors to gain more; third, a long-term perspective for long-term cooperation.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that the drafting of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law has been underway for several years and has made significant progress. The Consultative Committee has played a very good role in this process. We hope to make every effort to complete the drafting of the Basic Law on time for submission to the Third Session of the Seventh National People's Congress in the spring of next year for deliberation and adoption.

Jiang Zemin also analyzed the causes of the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the mainland and the necessity of the measures taken to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing.

Anzi Jie, Luo Dezeng, and Wong Po-hin and their entourage were invited by the Chairman of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Basic Law Drafting Committee and Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Ji Pengfei, to come to Beijing to study the next phase of soliciting opinions on the Basic Law (Draft). Those who participated in the meeting today, in addition to Ji Pengfei, included Vice Chairman of the Basic Law Drafting Committee and Director of the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch Xu Jiatun, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General of the Basic Law Drafting Committee, Deputy Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, Li Hou and Lu Ping.

    江泽民会见安子介一行时强调
    按“一国两制”处理港澳台问题
    尽一切努力如期完成香港基本法起草工作
    新华社北京7月11日电  中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见了香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会副主任委员、基本法咨询委员会主任安子介，基本法咨询委员会副主任罗德丞，基本法起草委员会委员黄保欣等香港知名人士。
  江泽民对客人说，用“一国两制”的方针解决香港问题，不只是外交上的需要，而是从香港和整个国家的根本利益出发的。这样解决，对香港、对整个国家有利，对英国和其他国家也有利。
    江泽民说，在处理港澳和台湾的问题上，我们采取“一国两制”的方针，我搞我的社会主义，你搞你的资本主义，“井水不犯河水”，我不会在港澳和台湾搞社会主义，你也不要把资本主义的一套搬到内地来。
    在谈到处理国际关系问题时，江泽民说，我们历来主张不同制度的国家在五项原则的基础上和平共处。
    江泽民告诉客人，他在上海时曾对来访的外国企业家说过，我们同外国朋友的经济合作，一是要互相理解，在这个基础上建立起互相信任；二是要互利，可以让来做生意的外商得利多一点；三是要有长远眼光，长期合作。
    江泽民指出，香港特别行政区基本法的起草工作已经进行了几年，卓有成效。咨询委员会在其中起了很好的作用。希望尽一切努力，如期完成基本法的起草，以提交明年春天举行的七届全国人大三次会议审议、通过。
    江泽民向客人们分析了最近内地发生学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱的成因以及北京平息反革命暴乱所采取措施的必要性。
    安子介、罗德丞、黄保欣一行是应香港特别行政区基本法起草委员会主任委员、国务院港澳办公室主任姬鹏飞邀请，来京研究下一阶段基本法（草案）的征求意见工作的。今天参加会见的除姬鹏飞外，还有基本法起草委员会副主任委员、新华社香港分社社长许家屯，基本法起草委员会正副秘书长、国务院港澳办公室副主任李后和鲁平。
