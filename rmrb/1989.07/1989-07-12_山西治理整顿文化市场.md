Shanxi Regulates and Rectifies the Cultural Market

Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Wang Aisheng and Chi Maohua report from Taiyuan: The Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have recently arranged for a comprehensive regulation and rectification of the cultural market across the entire province.

In recent years, obscene and pornographic publications have frequently appeared on the cultural market in Shanxi, despite repeated bans; books and magazines with violent and unhealthy content have been prevalent; superstition-related publications such as fortune-telling, divination, and palmistry have resurfaced; the publication and distribution of audio-visual products have been chaotic, and so on. These issues have seriously corrupted the minds of young people. The Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided to organize relevant departments, including public security, commerce, culture, radio and television, and press and publication, to unite their forces. Over the next two months, they will inspect and rectify the distribution of books and magazines, the sale and screening of video tapes, the sale of audio-visual products, and the operation of cultural entertainment activities (including dance parties, dance halls, music tea houses, game rooms, billiard rooms, amusement parks, singing and dancing troupes, and performance troupes) across the entire province. The main focus will be on inspecting and rectifying business licenses, tax certificates, business guidelines, cultural atmosphere, and tax law enforcement.

    山西治理整顿文化市场
    本报太原7月12日电　记者王艾生、新华社记者池茂花报道：山西省委、省政府最近布置在全省范围内治理整顿文化市场。
    近年来，山西文化市场上一些淫秽、色情出版物屡禁不止；凶杀等不健康内容的书刊盛行；算命、卜卦、手相等迷信出版物又有抬头；音像出版发行混乱等等。这种情况，严重地腐蚀了青少年心灵。省委、省政府决定由公安、工商、文化、广播电视、新闻出版等有关部门，统一组织力量，用两个月的时间，对全省城乡书刊发行、录像带发行放映、音像制品的销售活动、文化娱乐的经营活动（包括舞会、舞厅、音乐茶座、游艺室、桌球台球室、游乐场、歌舞乐队和演出团体等）进行检查整顿。主要检查整顿营业证件、税务证件、经营方针、文化情调、税法执行情况等。
