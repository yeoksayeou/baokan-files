Recently, the publishing market has been turbulent, frequently experiencing waves of popularity. One trend after another emerges: pseudo-science fiction, detective stories, nostalgia for the past, martial arts, supernatural themes, romantic novels... one trend has barely subsided before another emerges. The situation is intense, urgent, and overwhelming, like a storm. The publishing management departments are exhausted, trying to control the situation by blocking and sealing publications. Just as they manage to control one trend, another suddenly appears like a magic trick.

In the Year of the Dragon, a new wave of interest in the human body suddenly emerged. Photographic, oil painting, sketch, and watercolor... various types of human body art albums flooded the market, dazzling the eyes. According to incomplete statistics, so far, the country has published dozens of such albums, and some are still being printed. Among these albums, there are indeed some healthy and elegant works, but there are also many with low taste, focusing on sensory stimulation. At the beginning of the Year of the Snake, another trend emerged: fortune-telling. Books like "Life Prediction," "Face Reading," "Palmistry and Life," "Blood Type and the Twelve Zodiac Signs," "Three Generations of Face Reading," "Five Elements Fortune-Telling Book," "Complete Palmistry" and so on, with miraculous speed and scale, swept through the book market outside the national bookstores. These publications all have official ISBNs and are 100% "legal." They are printed in tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of copies. Some are reprinted multiple times, without specifying the print run, and the prices are exorbitant. These new trendy items, along with beauty books, hairstyle books, cooking books, curiosity books, bedtime books, qigong books, secret books, and sex books, form a grand alliance, displayed in every street and alley, scattered on bookstalls. Facing this shocking scene, one can't help but worry for the publishing management departments.

However, who is to blame? In just a few years, the number of publishing houses in the country has increased from over a hundred to over five hundred. Guangdong Province, in particular, has seen a significant increase, from one to fourteen. It is said that more publishing houses will be added nationwide. This is truly a great leap forward! Even if we conservatively estimate that each publishing house has 80 employees, the approximately four hundred new publishing houses will need over thirty thousand employees. Salaries, bonuses, welfare, housing, office buildings, profit targets, and other needs all depend on the readers' somewhat meager pockets. These thirty thousand new publishing house employees must use all their tricks to survive and develop, opening up new financial sources. Once they discover a "gold mine," they will inevitably flock to it like ants to honey. Thus, one trend after another emerges and spreads like wildfire. The periodic fever in the publishing market is partly due to the excessive number of publishing houses.

People in the publishing industry who see the situation clearly are worried and often sigh that serious literary journals and books are not selling, academic works are not profitable; the industry is shrinking, and the situation is severe. In fact, this "shrinkage" and "severe" situation is caused by the "prosperity" and "thriving" on the other side! The latter's "blossoming" is purely the result of the publishing industry being out of control.

It's better to remove the firewood than to stop the boiling water. If we do not reduce or merge some redundant and duplicate publishing houses, and if we do not curb the overheated development of the publishing industry, the fever in the publishing market will be incurable. In the end, it will only bring endless troubles to the publishing industry, leading to the survival of the unfit and making it even harder for the publishing management departments.

    一热未退，一热又兴
    岑桑
    近年来，出版物市场风波诡谲，频频发烧，一会儿是这个热，一会儿又是那个热。伪科幻热、侦破热、陈朽热，接踵而至的是武侠热、神怪热、言情热……一热未退，一热又兴。其势汹汹，既急且猛，风起云涌。弄得出版管理部门疲于奔命。且截且堵，又查又封，好不容易才把热过了头的局面勉强控住，曾几何时，竟又像变戏法似的冒出另一热来。
    龙年，忽然闹洋洋又兴起了人体热。摄影的，油彩的，素描的，水粉的……种种人体艺术图册铺天盖地，琳琅满目。据不完全统计，到目前为止全国已出版此类图册达五六十种之多，有的还在赶紧印制。这一类图册中，固然不乏健康高雅之作，但是格调低下，以感官刺激为主旨者也比比皆是。蛇年伊始，又出现了命相热，什么《人生预测》、《面相析》、《手相与人生》、《血型与十二属相》、《三世相法》、《五行算命书》、《手相学大全》等等，以奇迹般的速度与规模，席卷全国新华书店以外的图书市场。这类出版物都有统一书号，百分之一百的“合法”。它们一印就是几万、十几万以至几十万。有的一版再版，三版四版，压根儿不标明印数，而且售价奇昂。这等新兴的热门货与美容书、发型书、烹饪书、奇趣书、床上书、气功书、秘闻书、性书……结成大同盟，摆在街头巷尾星罗棋布于书摊之上。面对这触目惊心的景象，真叫人不能不为出版管理部门焦急。
    然而，这又能怪谁呢？不几年，全国出版社已从原来的一百多家发展到目前的五百多家。敝省广东，在这方面尤其突出，早已从一家猛增到十四家了。据说在全国范围内，出版社还要陆续增加。真是不折不扣的大“跃进”啊！少算一点，每家出版社的员工编制就以80人计吧，新增的约四百家出版社就需三万多从业人员。工资、奖金、福利、住房、办公楼、利润指标等等所需，都端赖从读者们有点儿羞涩的腰包里掏。三万多出版社新军为此不得不使出浑身解数，以各自的奇谋绝招图生存、求发展，开天辟地，广拓财源，一旦发现“富矿”所在，自必如蚁附膻。于是这个热、那个热就这般地冒烟而燎原。出版物市场周期性的发烧现象，原因之一在出版社过多过滥。
    出版界有识之人士愁眉不展，频频哀叹严肃文学期刊、著作卖不出，学术著作赔不起；事业萎缩，局面严峻。其实，这一面的“萎缩”和“严峻”，还不是那一面的“繁荣”和“畅达”所造成的！而后者的“怒放”，则纯然是出版业发展失控之所致。
    扬汤止沸不如釜底抽薪。不裁减、兼并一些多余的、重复的出版社，不抑制出版事业过热的势头，否则出版物市场“热”的顽疾是无法医治的，到头来只会给出版界带来无穷苦难，变成劣胜优汰而且更加难为出版管理部门。
