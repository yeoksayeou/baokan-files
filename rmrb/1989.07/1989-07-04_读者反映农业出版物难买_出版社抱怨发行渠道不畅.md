The People's Daily, May 25, published an article by Jin Hanhui from Shaanxi, titled "Why Are There So Few Agricultural Publications?" This article has drawn the attention of our colleagues at the Agricultural Publishing House. We would like to express our views on this matter.

Currently, there are several publishing houses nationwide that specialize in agricultural books. Most provincial science and technology publishing houses have agricultural editing departments, and some comprehensive publishing houses also publish rural reading materials. Indeed, compared to the hundreds of publishing houses nationwide, this number seems small, and the proportion of agricultural publications in the national publishing market is correspondingly low. However, we believe that the problem lies not only in this but more importantly in the lack of smooth channels for book orders. Taking our publishing house as an example, over the past 31 years since its establishment, we have published over 10,000 agricultural, livestock, veterinary, aquaculture, and meteorological books, totaling 340 million copies. Even in recent years, when paper prices soared, labor costs increased, and funds were tight, we did not rush to reduce the number of agricultural books published. We continue to publish over 600 agricultural books annually, with 50% of them being new editions. In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture, the State Science and Technology Commission, and other units, we have also launched the "Harvest Plan Series," "Spark Plan Series," and "Vegetable Basket Project Series." However, what has been the outcome? According to regulations, the main channel for our book distribution is through the Xinhua Bookstore for nationwide orders. This year, in the first quarter, 41 books were ordered through the Beijing Science and Technology Distribution Center, with an average print run of 1,525 copies. Twenty-one of these books had orders of less than 1,000 copies, accounting for 51%. Among them, "Identification and Control of Cotton Bollworms" had 720 copies, "Cow Infertility" had 750 copies, "Northern Sugarcane Cultivation Technology" had 650 copies, "Environmental Toxicology of Insecticides" had 770 copies, and "Catalogue of Chinese Rice Varieties" had 71 copies. In May, a list of 9 books showed that 5 had orders of less than 1,000 copies, accounting for 55%, with the lowest print run being 470 copies. Local Xinhua Bookstores do not stock these books beyond the ordered quantities. This clearly shows the low print run of agricultural books.

The public demands books but we struggle to sell the books we publish, resulting in both effort and loss. This indicates that the main distribution channel through the Xinhua Bookstore is not smooth and does not meet current needs. As for how to solve this problem, many newspapers and magazines have already discussed it extensively, so we will not elaborate here. We appeal to the relevant authorities to take practical measures to reform book distribution and revitalize the agricultural publishing industry.

### 读者反映农业出版物难买  出版社抱怨发行渠道不畅

    读者反映农业出版物难买  出版社抱怨发行渠道不畅
    贵报5月25日第四版内刊登了陕西读者靳瀚恢同志的文章《农业出版物为何这么少？》一文，引起了我们农业出版社同仁的关注，很想就此问题发表一点看法。
    目前全国有好几家出版社专门出版农业图书，各省的科技出版社也基本配备有农业编辑室，此外，尚有一些综合出版社也出版部分农村读物。诚然，这与全国几百家出版社相比似乎为数太少，而农业出版物在全国出版物中所占比例也相应显得很少了。但是我们认为，问题不仅在于此，更重要的还是图书征订的渠道不畅通。以我社为例，我社建社31年来，出版过农业、畜牧、兽医、水产、气象等各类农业图书计1万余种，总印数达3.4亿册。就在近几年纸张价格猛涨、工价上调、资金紧缺的情况下，我们也没有急功近利地减少农业图书的出版，仍然坚持每年出版600余种各类农业图书，其中新版书达50％。配合农业部、国家科委等单位的工作，我们还推出了《丰收计划丛书》、《星火计划丛书》、《菜篮子工程丛书》。然而，效果又如何呢？按照规定，我社图书发行的主渠道是通过新华书店向全国进行征订。今年一季度通过北京科技发行所征订41种图书，平均印数为1525册，订数不足千册的达21种，占51％。其中《棉虫识别及防治》720册，《奶牛不孕症》750册，《北方果蔗栽培技术》650册，《杀虫药剂的环境毒理学》770册，《中国稻种资源目录》71册。5月份的一份征订单上，9种书中就有5种订数不足千册，占55％，最低印数470册。各地新华书店除订数外，均不备库存。由此可以看出农业图书印数之低到了何等程度。
    群众呼吁买不到书，而我们又愁于出了书卖不出去，费力又赔钱，这就不难看出，主要问题在于通过新华书店发行这个主渠道不畅通，这种流通渠道已不适应当前的需要。至于如何解决这个问题，许多报刊都已多次发表文章，这里不再赘述。我们吁请有关主管部门采取切实措施，改革图书发行，以兴盛农业图书出版业。
