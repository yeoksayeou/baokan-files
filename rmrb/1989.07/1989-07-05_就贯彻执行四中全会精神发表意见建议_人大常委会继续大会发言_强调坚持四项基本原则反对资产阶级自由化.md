The eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress was held today, continuing with speeches from committee members. The members enthusiastically discussed their understanding of the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee and offered suggestions and opinions on implementing its decisions.

Wan Li, the Chairman of the Standing Committee, attended the meeting. Vice-Chairmen Rong Yiren and Liao Hansheng presided over the meeting.

Vice-Chairman Alpu Jinmei said, "The recent turmoil in Beijing indeed has both international and domestic factors. However, we must also reflect on why so many people were drawn into this turmoil. It involved not only students and citizens but also our national cadres, party cadres, and even high-ranking officials. For a period, the prestige of both the Party and the government among the people was greatly reduced, causing some people to lose confidence in the Party and the government. During the height of the turmoil, some people did not believe the government's statements, did not believe our newspapers and radio stations, and only believed Voice of America and rumors, leading to extreme chaos. This is something we must deeply reflect on. I believe there are many reasons, but an important one is that our ideological and political work has been weak, and bourgeois liberalization has been rampant. Another reason is that our work has been ineffective, and problems that should have been solved were not addressed. Although we have formulated good constitutions and other laws, correct guidelines, policies, and lines, we have not worked diligently to implement these laws and policies. Taking the issue of ethnic minorities as an example, the Party has formulated many good policies for ethnic minorities, consistently advocating for the equality of all ethnicities, especially the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy passed by the Second Session of the Sixth National People's Congress in 1984, which was warmly supported and praised by the people of all ethnicities, especially the ethnic minorities. However, since the promulgation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy five years ago, there have been many problems in its implementation. Due to the lack of corresponding implementing regulations, necessary specific policies and measures have not been formulated, and the autonomy of ethnic autonomous areas has not been well guaranteed. The problem of widening economic and cultural development gaps between ethnic regions and general regions has not been reversed. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee, and the State Ethnic Affairs Commission have repeatedly sought to hold a symposium on the implementation of the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, hoping that the State Council and relevant departments would propose some specific policies and measures to solve some problems, but there have been many difficulties, and it has not been successful. In addition, in recent years, the propaganda and education of ethnic policies have been insufficient, and there have been some problems in ethnic relations. If these problems in ethnic regions are not solved, there will also be factors of instability. For the long-term stability and prosperity of our country, when calmly considering the past and the future, I hope that the Party Central Committee will definitely place the solution of ethnic issues in an important position, diligently implement the Party's ethnic policies, and seriously implement the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, so that all unstable factors can be eliminated in the bud and not allowed to spread and grow."

Vice-Chairman Liao Hansheng said, "Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out in his speech: 'In political system reform, one thing can be certain, that is, we will adhere to the system of people's congresses, not the American-style three-branch system.' Our system of people's congresses is a political organization form led by the Communist Party of China, which suits China's national conditions and reflects the nature of our country. It is an institution that ensures that the Chinese people exercise their right to be masters of the country and manage state power. It is the fundamental political system of our socialist country. Implementing this system is beneficial for the people to fully exercise their socialist democratic rights and is also beneficial for maintaining the unity of people's power, having great advantages. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, to strengthen the construction of the system of people's congresses, develop socialist democracy, and improve socialist legal system, the Party has led the people to make great efforts, making this system increasingly show its unique political advantages and strong vitality. Those who promote bourgeois liberalization, in order to negate the Party's leadership and negate the socialist system, always advocate for the Western parliamentary system, promote the three-branch system, and denigrate our system of people's congresses. We can review that in recent years, the voices of beautifying Western parliamentary systems, advocating for the three-branch system, and denigrating our system of people's congresses have been unending. In this turmoil, the organizers and planners again took the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as one of their important targets. Although their conspiracy has failed, we must have a clear understanding and sufficient vigilance of this. In political system reform, we must adhere to and improve the system of people's congresses, not abandon or change the system of people's congresses. We must, under the leadership of the Party, earnestly implement the Party's basic line and the Constitution, closely connect with the masses to do a good job in the work of people's congresses, strengthen the construction of people's congresses, maintain the dignity of the Constitution and laws, and fully give play to the political advantages of the system of people's congresses.

Our country's democratic construction can only be carried out under the leadership of the Party, step by step and in an orderly manner. Democracy without the leadership of the Party and democracy without the socialist legal system is not people's democracy and socialist democracy. Such actions can only cause great chaos in the country and no peace. This has been proven by the two turmoils. A painful lesson is that we must resolutely establish the authority of the law, strengthen legal system construction, and absolutely maintain social stability. We must further improve the legal system to provide a more complete legal guarantee for preventing and stopping turmoils. We must further strengthen legal education, using this turmoil and riot as a negative example, to improve citizens' legal awareness. Especially, we must firmly maintain the dignity of socialist legal system. We must resolutely ensure that the law is observed, strictly enforced, and violated. We must resolutely ensure that everyone is equal before the law. Every turmoil generally starts with the destruction of the legal system. In the future, wherever the turmoil arises, we must show the dignity of the legal system there, display the power of the legal system, and stop it by law. Whoever dares to test the law will be severely punished by law."

Comrade Mamutufu Kurban said, "From the perspective of ethnic work, Zhao Ziyang deviated from the four cardinal principles, supporting and inciting the rampant bourgeois liberalization, which also had a very bad impact on our Party's ethnic work. In the short few years since he took charge of the central work, bourgeois liberalization thoughts have been rampant in the literary and artistic circles and ideological circles, and films, scripts, novels, and so-called documentaries and reports that deliberately defame, insult ethnic minorities, and hurt the feelings of ethnic minority comrades have appeared one after another. These literary and artistic works that seriously insult ethnic minority comrades and hurt ethnic feelings have damaged our Party's consistent correct ethnic policies and principles and seriously affected the close and fraternal relationship between the ethnicities of our country. This lesson is painful. Zhao Ziyang's mistakes in ethnic work and other aspects and the consequences he caused to the Party and the country are extremely serious. I fully support the Fourth Plenum's exposure of his serious mistakes, the removal of all his positions, and the continued investigation of his problems."

Comrades Yang Lieyu, Zhang Shiming, and Yao Jun made a joint speech, believing that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress urgently needs to improve and strengthen supervision work. In view of the heavy supervision tasks assigned by the Constitution to the Standing Committee, it is suggested that a supervision agency be established under the leadership of the Standing Committee to specially carry out and undertake this work. The details such as the name, organization, legal supervision procedures, and scope of powers and responsibilities can be entrusted to a department of the organ to conduct research and write an initial draft, which will be submitted to the Standing Committee for discussion and approval before establishment.

Vice-Chairman Zhu Xuefan said, "In recent years, the propagandists of bourgeois liberalization have spread fallacies such as 'diluting the Party,' 'diluting the status and role of the working class,' 'diluting the leadership of the working class,' and 'diluting the role of trade unions,' attempting to eliminate the leading role of the working class, oppose socialism, and implement capitalism. In those days when bourgeois liberalization was rampant, we rarely heard, and even for a while did not hear, about the leading role of the working class, the master status of the working class, and that the working class is the main force of the Four Modernizations and reform. Forty years ago, it was by wholeheartedly relying on the working class that we achieved victory and consolidated the newly born People's Republic. In the current period of building the Four Modernizations and reform and opening up, we must always adhere to and defend the idea of wholeheartedly relying on the working class. In strengthening democratic and legal system construction, we must resolutely implement the 'Enterprise Law' and expedite the formulation of the new 'Trade Union Law'."

Comrade Wang Houde, speaking on behalf of Vice-Chairman Ni Zhifu and Comrade Zhang Ruiying, expressed his opinion on the important mistake of Comrade Zhao Ziyang ignoring the leading position and master status of the working class. The speech pointed out that the first article of our Constitution stipulates, 'The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the leadership of the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants.' This fundamental law stipulates that the working class is the leading class of our socialist country. However, for a period, our propaganda on the leading position of the working class and wholeheartedly relying on the working class has become less and less, and more and more 'diluted.' This is closely related to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's attitude on this issue. Comrade Zhao Ziyang has rarely talked about relying on the working class for a long time, and in the reform, some enterprises have not correctly handled the relationship between the manager and the workers, and Comrade Zhao Ziyang's idea is to rely on 'elite governance' and 'able people managing factories.' Due to his deviation in the issue of relying on whom, it caused social ideological chaos, and thus the myth of 'one able person saving one enterprise' appeared, the fallacy of 'workers' quality is low and not suitable for participating in enterprise management' appeared, and the trend of 'current labor models are not popular' and 'hard work is outdated' appeared, even Shanghai Comrade Yang Huaiyuan's 'little shoulder pole spirit' became a topic of criticism. It can be seen how chaotic the ideology is. Wholeheartedly relying on the working class is a consistent proposition of our Party. To do a good job in the Four Modernizations construction, we need to rely on the working class. To adhere to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, we also need to rely on the working class. The facts have proven that the working class of China is reliable. They are not only the main force in developing productive forces but also the main force in maintaining social stability. At the same time, we are also clearly aware that to rely on the working class, we must strive to improve the political awareness of the working class, truly protect the master status and legal rights and interests of the broad masses of workers, and improve the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. To this end, we suggest: promptly formulate the 'Labor Law,' earnestly implement the 'Enterprise Law,' promptly revise the new 'Trade Union Law,' and vigorously publicize the status and role of the working class, firmly establish the idea of wholeheartedly relying on the working class."

Comrade Fu Hao said, "The recent student movement and turmoil in the capital, which escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot, lasted for nearly two months, which is unprecedented and has also attracted widespread attention from the international community. Most countries believe that the measures taken by the Chinese government against the counter-revolutionary riot are China's internal affairs, which are understandable and should not be interfered with by outsiders. However, some countries, during this period, fanned the flames, spread rumors, and stirred up trouble, creating an anti-China trend. It is well known that the Chinese government has always maintained a very restrained attitude towards this turmoil, and only when it could no longer be tolerated did it have to take decisive measures to quell the riot and punish the criminals by law. This is a matter of course, an internal affair of a country, and no foreign government or society has the right to interfere with or comment on it. However, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a so-called 'amendment,' criticizing the Chinese government's exercise of sovereignty, which is a gross violation of international law, and we absolutely cannot accept it. The U.S. House of Representatives uses sanctions to put pressure on us, which is futile and will only damage and worsen the relationship between China and the United States, which has been established by the efforts of many people over the past decade, and is not in the interests of the American people."

Comrade Xu Jialu said, "All our schools, especially institutions of higher learning, are important ideological frontiers under the leadership of the Party. The most fundamental task of schools is to cultivate talents. What kind of people do we need? We can only have people who serve socialist construction and serve the 1.1 billion people. This requires us to put ethics education in the first place. In recent years, we have overly emphasized intelligence education, and ethics education is either neglected or ineffective and powerless. This student movement is concentrated in universities, and the most active in universities are mainly first and second-year students. This shows that ideological education for students must start from middle school and even primary school. We should let them have good personal virtues from a young age, understand the principle that the fate of the country is the responsibility of every individual, and also let them know the law and abide by it. In a word, we must first let the children learn to be qualified citizens, and on this basis, cultivate their revolutionary outlook on life and worldview. The education of young people should become an important political task for the whole Party and the whole nation, and should form a social atmosphere where everyone cares about the growth of young people and everyone contributes to education, enhancing the sense of responsibility for education among Party members and citizens."

Other committee members who spoke at today's meeting include: Zou Yu, Zhang Chengxian, Yin Fatang, Song Ruzhi, Ye Shuhua (on behalf of Dong Yincheng, Guo Xiuzhen, Yuan Xuefen, Ye Gongqi), Li Xuezhi, Gu Ming, and Song Yiping. Legal Committee member Jiang Yiming, who attended the meeting, also spoke. Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Jilin Province, Cui Lin, and Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Liaoning Province, Zuo Kun, made written speeches.

    就贯彻执行四中全会精神发表意见建议
    人大常委会继续大会发言
    强调坚持四项基本原则反对资产阶级自由化
    新华社北京7月5日电　七届全国人大常委会第八次会议今天继续进行大会发言。委员们热烈发言，畅谈学习党的十三届四中全会精神的体会，发表贯彻执行四中全会精神的意见和建议。
    万里委员长出席会议。副委员长荣毅仁、廖汉生主持会议。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美副委员长说，这次在北京发生的动乱，的确有国际上的大气候和中国的小气候的原因，同时我们也不能不反思一下这次动乱的规模之大、来势之猛的其他原因。为什么会有这么多人卷进这场风波？他们不仅是青年学生、市民，还有我们的国家干部、党员干部，甚至还有高层干部。一段时期内，不管是我们的党、还是我们的政府在人民群众中的威信大大降低，使一部分群众对党和政府失去信心，在动乱达到高潮时，一些人不相信政府说的话，不相信我们的报纸和电台，只相信美国之音和谣言，达到了极其混乱的程度，这不能不令人深思。我认为原因很多，但很重要的原因，一是这些年我们思想政治工作薄弱，资产阶级自由化泛滥。二是工作不力，该解决的问题没有解决。我们虽然制定了很好的宪法和其他法律，有了正确的方针、路线和政策，但没有扎扎实实地工作，没有很好地贯彻执行这些法律和政策。拿少数民族问题来说，党对少数民族制定了许多很好的政策，党一贯倡导各民族一律平等，尤其是1984年六届全国人大二次会议通过的民族区域自治法，受到了全国各族人民特别是各少数民族人民的热烈拥护和赞扬，但自治法颁布5年来，在贯彻执行过程中存在许多问题，由于没有相配套的实施细则，没有制定必要的具体政策和措施，民族自治地方的自治权不能得到很好的保障，民族地区同一般地区相比经济文化发展差距继续拉大的问题不能扭转。我们人大民委、中央统战部、国家民委曾多次争取召开自治法贯彻实施座谈会，希望国务院及有关部委提出一些具体政策和措施，解决一些问题，但困难较多，始终未能如愿。此外，这几年民族政策宣传教育不够，民族关系上不时出现一些问题。民族地区的这些问题不解决，也存在不安定因素。为了我们国家的长治久安，繁荣昌盛，在冷静地考虑过去和未来时，希望党中央一定要把解决好民族问题摆在重要的位置上，扎扎实实地贯彻好党的民族政策，认真贯彻好民族区域自治法，让各种不稳定因素消灭在萌芽状态，决不能让它蔓延滋长。
    廖汉生副委员长说，小平同志在最近的讲话中明确指出：“在政治体制改革中，有一点可以肯定，就是我们要坚持人民代表大会制度，而不是美国式的三权鼎立制度。”我国人民代表大会制度，是中国共产党领导中国人民创立的符合我国国情，体现我国国家性质的政权组织形式，是确保我国人民行使当家作主，管理国家权力的制度，是我国社会主义的根本政治制度。实行这一制度，既有利于人民充分行使社会主义民主权利，又有利于维护人民权力的统一，具有巨大的优越性。党的十一届三中全会以来，为了加强人民代表大会制度建设，发展社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，党领导人民进行了巨大努力，使这一制度愈来愈显示出其独有的政治优势和强大的生命力。搞资产阶级自由化的人，为了否定党的领导，否定社会主义制度，推行全盘西化的主张，总是企图改变我国的社会主义政治制度，要用三权鼎立的制度来代替我国的人民代表大会制度。我们可以回顾一下，这些年来，美化西方议会制，鼓吹三权鼎立，诋毁我国人民代表大会制度的声音，是不绝于耳的。在这次动乱中，动乱的组织者、策划者们，又把人大常委会作为他们进攻的一个重要目标。他们的阴谋虽然破产了，但对此，我们一定要有清醒的认识和足够的警惕。在政治体制改革中，我们要坚持和完善人民代表大会制度，而不是放弃和改变人民代表大会制度。我们一定要在党的领导下，认真贯彻党的基本路线和宪法，密切联系群众做好人大工作，加强人大建设，维护宪法法律的尊严，充分发挥人民代表大会制度的政治优势。
    我国的民主建设，只能在党的领导下，有步骤有秩序地进行。不要党的领导的民主，不要社会主义法制的民主，决不是人民民主、社会主义民主。那样做，只能搅得天下大乱，国无宁日。这一点，已为两次动乱所证明。痛定思痛，一个重要的教训是必须坚决树立法制权威，大力加强法制建设，绝对保持社会稳定。要进一步健全法制，为预防和制止动乱提供更为完备的法律保证。进一步抓好普法教育，以这次动乱和暴乱为反面教材，提高公民的法制观念。特别是要坚定不移地维护社会主义法制的尊严。坚决做到有法必依，执法必严，违法必究；坚决做到法律面前人人平等。每次动乱的形成，一般都是从破坏法制开始。今后，动乱在哪里冒头，就要在那里呈现法制的尊严，施展法制的威力，依法予以制止。谁敢以身试法，就依法严惩不贷。
    马木托夫·库尔班委员说，从民族工作来讲，由于赵紫阳背离四项基本原则，支持、怂恿资产阶级自由化的泛滥，对我党的民族工作也产生了很坏的影响。在他主持中央工作以来的短短几年里在文艺界、思想界资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，接连不断地出现了故意丑化、侮辱少数民族、伤害少数民族同胞的电影、剧本、小说和所谓的纪实、报告。这些严重侮辱少数民族同胞、伤害民族感情的文艺作品的出现，损害了我党一贯坚持的正确的民族政策和方针、严重影响了我国各民族间的亲密团结的骨肉关系。这个教训是沉痛的。赵紫阳在民族工作等其它方面的错误和对党对国家造成的后果是极其严重的。我完全拥护四中全会揭发他的严重错误，撤销他的一切职务，对他的问题继续审查的决定。
    杨烈宇、章师明、姚峻3位委员在联合发言中认为，人大常委会亟待改进加强的是监督工作。又鉴于宪法规定常委会应负的监督任务很重，特建议在常委会领导下，成立监督机构专门开展和承担此项工作，其名称、组织、依法监督程序和责权范围等细节，可责成机关一个部门调研后写出初稿，交常委会讨论通过后设置。
    朱学范副委员长说，近几年来资产阶级自由化鼓吹者散布：“淡化党”、“淡化工人阶级的地位作用”、“淡化工人阶级的领导”、“淡化工会的作用”等等谬论，妄图取消工人阶级的领导作用，反对社会主义，实行资本主义。在那资产阶级自由化泛滥的日子里，我们很少听到甚至一度听不到工人阶级的领导作用、工人阶级的主人翁地位、工人阶级是四化建设和改革的主力军等等的话了。40年前，我们在迎接全国解放的日子里，正是全心全意依靠了工人阶级，才取得了胜利，巩固了新生的人民共和国。在当前建设四化、改革开放的新时期，我们应当始终坚持和捍卫全心全意依靠工人阶级这一思想。在加强民主和法制建设中，要坚决贯彻执行《企业法》，加紧新《工会法》的制订工作。
    王厚德委员在代表倪志福副委员长、章瑞英委员的联合发言中就赵紫阳同志忽视工人阶级的领导地位和主人翁作用这样一个重要失误问题发表了意见。发言指出，我国《宪法》第一条规定，“中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家”。这从根本大法上规定了工人阶级是我们社会主义国家的领导阶级。但是，一个时期以来我们对工人阶级的领导地位和全心全意依靠工人阶级的宣传，却越来越少，越来越被人“淡化”了。这同赵紫阳同志在这个问题上的态度是有密切关系的。赵紫阳同志长期以来很少讲要依靠工人阶级，在改革中少数企业未能正确处理厂长、经理同工人之间的关系，赵紫阳同志在思想上是依靠“精英治国”，“能人治厂”的。由于他在依靠谁的问题上出现的偏差，造成了社会思想混乱，于是就出现了“一个‘能人’救活一个企业”的神话，出现了“工人素质低，不宜参与企业管理”的怪论，出现了“现今劳模不吃香”、“艰苦奋斗过时”的思潮，连上海杨怀远同志的“小扁担精神”也成为批判的话题。可见思想混乱到何等程度。全心全意依靠工人阶级是我党的一贯主张，搞好四化建设需要依靠工人阶级，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放也要依靠工人阶级。事实证明，中国的工人阶级是可以信赖的。他们不仅是发展社会生产力的主力军，也是维护社会安定的主力军。同时，我们也清醒地认识到，要依靠工人阶级就要努力提高职工群众的政治觉悟，切实保护广大职工的主人翁地位和合法权益，提高广大职工的积极性。为此，我们建议：尽快制订《劳动法》，认真贯彻落实《企业法》，尽快修订出新的《工会法》，大力宣传工人阶级地位、作用，牢固树立全心全意依靠工人阶级思想。
    符浩委员说，这次在首都发生的学潮、动乱，直到升级为反革命暴乱，持续了近两个月，是前所未有的，也引起了国际社会的广泛注意。大多数国家认为中国政府对反革命暴乱采取的措施，是中国的内政，是可以理解的，不容外来干涉。但也有一些国家，在此其间，煽风点火，造谣惑众，推波助澜，掀起一股反华逆流。众所周知，中国政府对这场动乱一直保持十分克制的态度，直到忍无可忍的地步，才不得不采取断然措施，以平息暴乱，并依法惩处犯罪分子。这本来是天经地义的事，是一个国家的内政，任何外国政府和社会都无权干涉和说三道四。然而，美国众议院竟然通过了一项所谓“修正议案”，对中国政府行使主权横加指责，这是对国际法粗暴的践踏，我们绝对不能接受。美国众议院用制裁的措施向我国施加压力，是徒劳的，只会损害和恶化中美两国十多年来多少人为之努力而建立起来的关系，对美国本身是不利的，也不符合美国人民的利益。
    许嘉璐委员说，我们的所有学校，特别是高等学校，是党领导下的重要思想阵地。学校的最根本的任务是培养人才。我们需要的是什么样的人？只能是为社会主义建设服务的，为11亿人民服务的人。这就要求我们必须把德育放在首位。这几年，我们过份强调了智育，德育不是落空就是不得法，苍白无力。这次学潮集中在大学，而大学中最活跃的又主要是一、二年级学生。这就说明，对学生的思想教育必须从中学抓起，从小学抓起。应该让他们从小具有个人的优良品德，懂得国家兴亡匹夫有责的道理，还要让他们知法守法，一句话，必须让孩子首先学会做一个合格的公民，在这基础上再培养他们革命的人生观和世界观。对青少年的教育，应该成为全党全民的一项重要的政治任务，应该形成人人关心青少年成长、人人为教育出力的社会风气，增强党员和公民的教育责任感。
    在今天大会上发言的委员还有：邹瑜、张承先、阴法唐、宋汝棼、叶叔华（代表董寅初、郭秀珍、袁雪芬、叶公琦）、李学智、顾明、宋一平。列席会议的法律委员会委员蒋一苇也在会上发了言。列席会议的吉林省人大常委会副主任崔林、辽宁省人大常委会副主任左琨作了书面发言。
