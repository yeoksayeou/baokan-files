	National College Entrance Examinations Begin
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th - (Reporter Zhao Wei) Today, 2.66 million high school graduates across the nation began their three-day National College Entrance Examinations.
	This year, various levels and types of colleges and universities nationwide plan to enroll 640,000 students. According to the regulations of the State Education Commission, high school graduates who have consistently excelled in both academics and conduct during their middle school years may be exempted from the exams and directly recommended to higher education institutions for further studies.
	In the capital Beijing, which has just seen the suppression of unrest, the exams proceeded as normal as in previous years. At an exam site in the Xicheng District, our reporter encountered Meng Xun, a student from Beijing No. 3 Middle School. The school has decided to recommend her to study at the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University. She told our reporter, "I feel that the overall quality of our Chinese nation needs improvement. To improve the nation's quality, we must first develop education. This requires people to become teachers. I am willing to choose teaching as my life's work. Although teachers' salaries are currently low, I do not mind. I would rather be spiritually rich. Besides, teachers' salaries will gradually improve in the future."

    高校招生统考昨天开始
    新华社北京7月7日电　（记者赵伟）全国266万名高中毕业生今天开始参加为期三天的全国高等院校招生统一考试。
    今年国家各级各类高等院校共计划招生64万。根据国家教委规定，对于在中学阶段连年品学皆优的高中毕业生可免试由学校直接保送到高等院校学习。
    在刚刚平息暴乱的首都北京，考试同往年一样正常进行。在西城区的一个考点，记者遇到北京三中的孟昕同学。学校已决定保送她到北京师范大学中文系学习。她对记者说，“我觉得我们整个中华民族的素质有待提高。提高民族素质，首先要发展教育。这就要有人来当教师。我愿意把当老师作为我的人生选择。尽管现在教师待遇还比较低，我不在乎，我更愿作精神的富有者。再说教师的待遇以后还会慢慢提高。”（附图片）
