Vice Premier Tian Jiyun Meets with East German Guests

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th - Vice Premier Tian Jiyun met this afternoon in Zhongnanhai with the East German delegation led by Minister of Chemical Industry Günter Vieweg, who came to attend the fifth session of the Sino-East German Economic, Trade, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee.

Tian Jiyun emphasized that our current policies and guidelines will not change due to the recent counterrevolutionary riots in Beijing. That is to say, the line, guidelines, and policies since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee will not change. He said that in the future, we will continue to advance along this line.

He pointed out that our reform and opening up are being carried out under the socialist system, with the aim of further perfecting the socialist system.

He said that over the past nearly 100 years, some people have tried to lead China down the capitalist road, but they have all failed. This disturbance and riot were also an attempt by a small number of people within the country to lead China down the capitalist road, but they have failed.

He said that after China suppressed the counterrevolutionary riot, some Western countries have taken sanctions against China to varying degrees. These countries' actions are unwise and shortsighted. He stressed that China itself is a large market. After several decades of economic construction, China's economic foundation is solid, and its self-reliance has been enhanced. At this time, sanctions against China will not make us yield. Such sanctions cannot last long. Relations between countries in terms of economic and trade exchanges are based on equality and mutual benefit. Sanctions against China are not beneficial to either side.

During the meeting, Tian Jiyun expressed his appreciation for the East German government's just stance during China's suppression of the counterrevolutionary riot.

    田纪云会见民德客人
    新华社北京7月7日电  国务院副总理田纪云今天下午在中南海会见前来参加中国和民主德国经济、贸易、科技合作委员会第五次会议的、由化工部部长京特·维朔夫斯基率领的德方代表团。
    田纪云强调，我们的现行政策和方针不会因出现最近发生在北京的这场反革命暴乱而改变。也就是说，党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策不会改变。他说，今后要更好地沿着这一路线前进。
    他指出，我们改革开放是在坚持社会主义制度下进行的，目的在于使社会主义制度进一步完善。
    他说，近100年来，有的人想把中国引向资本主义道路，但他们都失败了。这次动乱和暴乱的发生，也是国内极少数人企图把中国引向资本主义，但他们失败了。
    他说，这次中国平息反革命暴乱之后，一些西方国家对中国采取了不同程度的制裁措施，这些国家的做法是不明智的，是短视的。他强调，中国本身就是个大市场，经过几十年的经济建设，中国的经济基础雄厚，自力更生能力增强，在此时对中国制裁，使我们屈服，是不可能的。这种制裁不能持久，国与国之间的经贸关系是建立在平等互利基础上的，对中国制裁对双方都不利。
    会见时，田纪云对民主德国政府在中国平息反革命暴乱期间所持的正义立场表示赞赏。
