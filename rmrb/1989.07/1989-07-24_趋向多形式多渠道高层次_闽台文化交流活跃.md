In the first half of this year, cultural, scientific, technological, sports, and medical exchanges and cooperation between Fujian and Taiwan have seen new developments. Nearly 300 Taiwanese cultural and scientific figures have come to Fujian to hold various art performances, exhibitions, and academic exchanges.

Since this year, exchanges in various fields between Fujian and Taiwan have developed towards higher levels, multiple forms, and multiple channels. During the Lantern Festival this year, music concerts featuring works by Taiwanese composers were held in Fuzhou and Xiamen, with renowned Taiwanese composers and performers invited to participate. A delegation of 39 members from the Taipei Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association visited the Fujian College of Traditional Chinese Medicine in mid-April for academic exchanges in traditional Chinese medicine, with notable figures from the Taiwanese medical community participating. In May, the "Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting by 60 Masters from Fuzhou" was held at the Spring Sea Art Gallery in Taipei, marking a significant event in Fujian-Taiwan cultural exchanges. Both sides have also collaborated to open training classes for drama and traditional Chinese medicine practitioners. Two elderly artists from Taiwan joined forces with mainland artists to establish a training class for Quanzhou opera in Zhangzhou.

Even during the turmoil and riots in Beijing, some Taiwanese compatriots still came to Fujian to participate in various exchange activities. In early June, 8 Taiwanese compatriots arrived in Fuzhou as scheduled to take the first-ever self-study examination for traditional Chinese medicine specialists held for Taiwan.

    趋向多形式多渠道高层次
    闽台文化交流活跃
    据新华社福州7月24日电　（通讯员张经纬）今年上半年闽台两省文化、科技、体育、医药等各种交流和合作又有新的发展；台湾文化、科技界人士来闽举办各种文艺演出、画展、学术交流等近300人次。
    今年以来，闽台文化等各项交流向高层次、多形式、多渠道发展。今年元宵节，在福州、厦门等地举办的台湾作曲家作品音乐会，应邀参加的都是台湾著名的作曲家和演奏家。台北市中医师公会赴大陆研讨团一行39人，4月中旬到福建中医学院进行中医学术交流，参加的都是台湾医药界的著名人士。今年5月在台北春海堂美术馆举办的“福州六十名家书画展览”，是闽台文化交流中规模较大的一次。两岸还合作开办戏剧、中医师等培训班。台湾两位老艺人出资与大陆老艺人合作在漳州举办了芗剧学习班。
    即使在北京发生动乱、暴乱期间，一些台胞仍来闽参加各项交流活动。6月上旬，8名台胞如期到福州参加首次对台湾举办的中医专业自学考试。
