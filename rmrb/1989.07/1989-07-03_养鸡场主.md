Title: The Poultry Farmer

From the mainland, I voluntarily came to Hainan. The question I was asked the most was, "Why did you come?"

This was a question that should have been easy to answer, but after answering it a few times, I found it difficult to explain. It was hard to make people believe that the answer was not "to make a lot of money" or "to better realize one's self-worth" and other popular phrases.

I became friends with C, partly because he was also someone who was hard to believe.

C is a young man from Sichuan who came to Hainan to run a private poultry farm. People naturally praised him for his initiative and business acumen. He refuted all the praise, and his serious and sincere demeanor made those who praised him lose interest. He always said, "I just came here for fun!"

C started doing business ten years ago and is said to have made a lot of money. For some unknown reason, he suddenly found business boring and started to "live in a drunken dream," even thinking of "shaving his head and becoming a monk."

A literary friend who was deeply involved in business had no sympathy for this: "A peasant! He made a little money and got scared."

Whether he was scared or not was secondary. The important thing was to do something interesting. When asked again, C would say, "Everything is boring. Doing nothing is even more boring. Doing something unsteady is the most boring. Relatively speaking, doing something you are interested in is not bad, even if it seems absurd and unbelievable to others. Like my old man, he just doesn't understand why I had to come to this remote place to run a poultry farm. I explained to him repeatedly that I think it's fun to do this, and the old man got angry and scolded me, 'You're only three years old!'"

Strangely, C's thin face, which often showed a "childish" expression in front of his girlfriend, had the thoughts of a philosopher.

Indeed, he had no formal education, but he loved to read leisurely books, especially after gaining some insights into the meaning of life, reading Tolstoy, Gorky, and Turgenev became a conscious act. Among his favorite books is "The Huntsman's Sketches" ... "I will eventually play with a large ranch! Oh, just think about it, just think about it, raising herds of horses, herds of cattle, holding a hunting rifle, leading a hunting dog ... then build a decent villa, invite you literary people to live in and write articles ... I'm not kidding, I came to Hainan, I saw the potential here to really roll up my sleeves and do these things I want to do ..."

I remember two years ago on the mainland, there was a young man in his twenties who loved watching American westerns and enthusiastically described to me the same dream as C's.

On a Sunday, I helped C move to the poultry farm. The car loaded with us and our belongings finally stopped in a muddy area. I saw the office and living quarters that C had described many times and had already formed in my mind, actually more like a makeshift shed. Stepping on it made it shake. Looking down from the bamboo window, bamboo and tile pieces were scattered on the ground, the chicken coop was not yet completed, the farm was enclosed in a circle of bamboo fences, and the fences were surrounded by the lush branches and leaves of guava, papaya, banana, and wild pomegranate—what a secluded place!

When the poultry farm is completed, the chicks are in the coop, and they are raised and released into the market, how much hard work awaits C, who has only read about how to raise chickens in books! Leaving old friends, living alone in a strange place, loneliness fills the void; when truly facing the simple and harsh living environment...

C, can you persist, and "play" to a high standard?

For "fun," C is definitely an insignificant figure among investors in Hainan.

If there is no chicken plague, and no unfortunate and unexpected events like the rumors of robbers with weapons and gangs robbing, if you persist in working hard and struggling...

Perhaps it's because I've seen too many people with their eyes fixed on the business world, hoping to get rich from a single deal, and seen too many strange phenomena like the same car being used by several or dozens of companies in secret deals. C, who started a small poultry farm with "fun" in mind, but seriously and earnestly did it, is somewhat moving...

We raised our glasses and sincerely wished, "To your success!" C disappointed everyone again, look at what he said: "To my finally doing what I wanted to do, what should be done, the result is not important..."

    养鸡场主
    刘敏
    从大陆自愿来海南，被问得最多的是为什么来？
    本是好回答的问题，在回答几次后却感觉难回答了。因为很难叫人相信，若那回答不是“为了挣大钱”，“为了更充分实现自我价值”等流行的术语。
    同C君熟了并成为朋友，一半因他也是个难以叫人相信的人。
    C君是来海南办私营养鸡场的四川小伙。人们理所当然夸他有闯劲，有事业心。他一一反驳，认真至诚的神态令夸他者无趣。他总是这么说：“我就为了好玩！”
    C君十年前开始做生意，据说赚了不少钱。不知何日起竟觉得生意场没意思，于是“醉生梦死”，起了“削发出家”的念头。
    一个正热衷于生意场的文友对此大不以为然：“农民！才赚了一点钱就噎慌了。”
    噎不噎倒其次，干什么有意思才是重要的。再问C君他就答：“干什么都没意思。什么都不干更没意思。干不踏实的事最没意思。相对说来，干点自己感兴趣的事还不错，哪怕那事别人看来荒唐不可思议。像我家老头就完全不懂我干吗非要来此天涯弄个养鸡场不可。我反复解释我觉得干这好玩，老人家勃然大怒骂我：‘才三岁大呀！’”
    奇怪，C君那干瘦的、常在女友跟前露出“顽童样”的面孔，何以竟有哲人的心思。
    果然，人家学历没有，只是爱好读闲书，特别是对生命的意义有些感悟以后，读托尔斯泰、高尔基、屠格涅夫就成为自觉行为了。在他最喜爱的书中就有《猎人笔记》……“我最终要玩它个大牧场！噢，只要想想，稍稍想想，放养一群群马、一群群牛，持着猎枪，牵着猎狗……然后盖栋够水平的大别墅，请你们这些文人住进去写文章……不骗你，来海南，我看中的就是在这里甩得开膀子干这些想干的……”谈起他正在兴建的养鸡场，C君常常吞云吐雾时热情奔放地倾吐他这更带玩兴的梦想。
    记得前年在大陆，也有一个二十出头的爱看美国西部片的小青年神采飞扬地向我描述过与C君相同的梦想。
    星期天送C君搬家到鸡场。旅行车载着我们和行李物件终于在一个泥泞的场地停定。我见到C君描述多次后已经在我头脑中成型的他那幢办公与居住的竹楼其实更似简易工棚，脚踩上去总摇摇晃晃。扶着竹窗下看，竹片、瓦片一地，鸡舍还未完顶，鸡场圈在一圈竹围篱中，围篱又被围于深浅着绿意的洋桃、木瓜、香蕉、野石榴那茂枝繁叶中——好一个幽辟处所！
    待鸡场建成，鸡苗入舍，养大投放市场，前面该有多少忙累等待至今尚只在书本上看过怎样养鸡的C君！离开老友，独居异地的寂寞排空袭来；待真正深入实际面对简陋艰苦的生活环境……C君，你能坚持下去，“玩”出点水平来么？
    为“玩兴”而来的C君，在海南的投资者中肯定是不起眼的小不点。
    如果不发生鸡瘟，也无传说中歹徒持凶器、群伙抢劫等不幸与意外；如果坚持脚踏实地、艰苦奋斗……大概是看多了眼睛盯紧生意场、巴望一笔交易就发福的人物，看多了诸如同一辆汽车竟被几家、几十家公司神神秘秘生意来、生意去的怪现象，C君这虽凭“玩兴”意起，毕竟认认真真地干开了小小养鸡场就有些让人感慨了……我们举起酒杯，真诚地祝愿：“为了您的成功！”C君又叫大家扫兴了，瞧他说的：“为我终于干了想干的事、该干的事吧，结果并不重要……”
