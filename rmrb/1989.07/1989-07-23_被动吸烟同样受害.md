Alice Trillin, aged 38, always considered herself very healthy, but trouble eventually struck. She coughed incessantly, and there were traces of blood in her sputum. After an X-ray, a large part of her lung was removed.

Trillin had lung cancer, a disease typically associated with smokers. However, she had never smoked a single cigarette. The cause of her lung cancer remained a mystery until a doctor friend asked about her parents' smoking habits. It turned out that both her parents were long-time smokers.

Trillin said, "No one ever mentioned passive smoking. I didn't pay much attention to it either. But recent research shows that in the United States, 3,000 to 5,000 non-smokers die from lung cancer each year. Deaths caused by passive smoking, including heart disease and other cancers, have increased tenfold compared to a few years ago. This results in approximately 46,000 non-smoker deaths annually, including 3,000 from lung cancer, 11,000 from other cancers, and 32,000 from heart attacks. Dr. Davis, director of the U.S. 'Smoking and Health' Office, said that apart from alcoholism and smoking itself, passive smoking has become the leading preventable cause of death in the United States. Each year, 390,000 people die from smoking-related causes, far exceeding the number of deaths from alcoholism."

In the 1980s, the issue of passive smoking was a contentious point between the U.S. tobacco industry and its opponents. Now, it is clear that passive smoking not only causes minor ailments like runny noses, watery eyes, headaches, and nausea, but can also be fatal, becoming a common environmental and political concern.

Environmental protection advocates believe that indoor air pollution is more severe than outdoor pollution, a situation prevalent throughout the United States.

Many people believe that smokers have their rights, but non-smokers should not pay the price. Relevant authorities believe that for non-smokers, cigarette smoke is about 40% more harmful than radon gas. If all controllable carcinogenic air pollution factors are considered, the risk is 100 times greater.

    被动吸烟同样受害
    三十八岁的爱丽思·特里林一直自认为非常健康，但不妙的事终于发生了。她不停地咳嗽，痰中还带着丝丝血迹。透视后，她的肺的大部分被切除了。
    特里林得的是肺癌，这一般是吸烟的人得的病，而她从未吸过一支烟。她得肺癌的原因一直令人迷惑。当她的一位当医生的朋友问起她的父母是否吸烟时才找到了她患肺癌的谜底：其父母有长期的吸烟史。
    特里林说：“从未有人谈起过被动吸烟这回事，我也不大在意。但近几年的研究表明，美国的非吸烟者中每年有三千至五千人死于肺癌。被动吸烟造成的死亡，包括诱发心脏病和其它癌症，已经上升到前几年的十倍。每年造成大约四点六万非吸烟者死亡，其中三千人死于肺癌，一点一万人死亡其它癌症，三点二万人死于心脏病发作。美国“吸烟与健康”办公室主任戴维斯博士说，除酗酒和吸烟本身之外，被动吸烟已成为美国首位可避免的死亡原因。美国每年由于吸烟造成的死亡人数为三十九万人，大大超过因酗酒而死亡的人数。
    八十年代，被动吸烟问题，一直是美国烟草工业及其反对者争论的焦点，现在看来，它不仅仅引起流鼻涕、流眼泪、头疼恶心等小毛病，而且会置人于死地，成为人类共同关心的环境和政治问题。
    环境保护人士认为，室内的环境污染比室外更严重，这种情况在整个美国到处可见。
    许多人认为吸烟者有他们的权利，但不吸烟者不应该为此付出代价。有关人士认为，对于非吸烟者来说，香烟的烟比氡气的危害大百分之四十左右，如果将所有受控制的致癌空气污染因素考虑进去，危险要大一百倍。
