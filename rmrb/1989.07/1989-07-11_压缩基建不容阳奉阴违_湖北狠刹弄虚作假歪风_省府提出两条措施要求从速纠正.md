According to Xinhua News Agency in Wuhan, July 11th, (reporter: Yang Zhengwen) The Hubei Provincial People's Government Office recently issued a circular criticizing some localities for their pretenses and false reporting in the process of curbing construction projects.

Statistics show that by April this year, Hubei Province had halted or delayed 801 construction projects, reducing the total investment by over 160 million yuan. To further implement the policy of "curbing," the Hubei Provincial People's Government has required the auditing departments to conduct follow-up audits on these halted or delayed projects. The results revealed that some localities had engaged in pretenses and false reporting in their work of curbing construction projects: out of the 535 halted or delayed projects that have been audited, 51 projects have already been completed, with an investment of 29.42 million yuan; 67 projects that were supposed to be halted are still under construction, with an investment of 112.8 million yuan.

According to investigations, the main methods used by these localities for pretenses and false reporting are as follows: reporting completed projects as halted or delayed projects, such as in Shashi City, where 14 out of the 22 projects in the second batch of halted or delayed projects have already been completed; reporting "shadow projects" as halted or delayed projects, such as the office building of the Hubei Electronics Company and the Jinghan Agricultural Housing Service Building, which were planned in 1986 but never started due to lack of funds and other difficulties, yet the relevant departments reported them as halted or delayed projects; halting in name but continuing construction in reality, such as the Fumin Building in Huangshi City, which had a total investment of 3.2 million yuan and was halted in December last year, but the construction unit secretly reconnected the power supply and continued construction; disguising as legal projects to continue construction, such as the dormitories of the Yingcheng Land Management Bureau and the Yingcheng Salt Factory, which were supposed to be halted due to exceeding the plan and improper funding sources. However, last September, the Yingcheng City Government transferred these two projects to a development company to build as commercial housing and reported them as halted or delayed projects to the provincial and municipal clearing offices.

In response, the Hubei Provincial Government has proposed two corrective measures: first, all localities and departments must promptly and seriously address the issues identified in the follow-up audits. Second, it requires the auditing departments to continue follow-up audits and supervise some localities to truly halt the projects that should be halted and truly cut down the investment projects that the state regulations require to be curtailed.

    压缩基建不容阳奉阴违  湖北狠刹弄虚作假歪风
    省府提出两条措施要求从速纠正
    据新华社武汉7月11日电  （记者杨正文）湖北省人民政府办公厅最近通报批评了少数地方在压缩基建规模中阳奉阴违、弄虚作假的做法。
    据统计，湖北省到今年4月止共停缓建项目达801项，压缩总投资16亿多元。为了进一步落实“压缩”方针，湖北省人民政府要求审计部门对决定停缓建的这些项目进行跟踪审计，结果发现一些地方在压缩基建规模的工作中存在阳奉阴违、弄虚作假的情况：在已审计的535项停缓建工程中，有51个项目已经建成，投资2942万元；没有停下来的在建项目有67个，投资11280万元。
    据调查，这些地方阳奉阴违、弄虚作假的主要手段是：完工工程上报成停缓建项目，如沙市市第二批停缓建项目共22个，审计部门进行跟踪审计时，已有14项是竣工工程；“影子工程”上报成停缓建项目，如省电子公司办公楼和京汉农房服务楼两项工程，1986年曾有此设想，后因资金不落实和其他困难，未做任何前期工作，但是有关部门把它们列作停缓建项目报了；名停实建，继续施工，黄石市的富民大楼总投资320万元，去年12月停建后，市供电部门按计划断了电，而建设单位却私自接通电源继续施工；穿上合法外衣，继续建设，如应城市土地管理局宿舍和市盐厂宿舍，由于超计划以及资金来源不正应当停建，可去年9月，应城市人民政府将这两个项目转给开发公司作商品房继续建设，同时上报省、地清办作为停缓建项目。
    湖北省政府为此提出了两条纠正措施：一是各地、各部门对跟踪审计发现的问题，必须从速认真解决。二是要求审计部门继续跟踪审计，督促一些地方把应停建的项目真正停下来，把国家规定应压缩的投资项目真正砍下来。
