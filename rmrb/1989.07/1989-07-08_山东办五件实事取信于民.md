Shandong to Undertake Five Major Tasks to Win Public Trust

The Shandong Provincial Committee, in line with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, has decided to earnestly undertake five major tasks to boost morale and push forward reform and construction.

In conjunction with implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the Shandong Provincial Committee is striving to accomplish five key tasks that are of great concern to the public:

1. **Seriously investigate and prosecute cases of leaders at all levels abusing power for personal gain, embezzlement, bribery, and malpractice.** For major cases that have been verified, swift action must be taken to punish them according to party discipline, administrative regulations, and legal provisions, and to make the details public. For major cases that have been identified, members of the Provincial Committee Standing Committee should take responsibility for each case and investigate thoroughly. For cases reported by the public, swift action must be taken to organize forces to investigate and handle them promptly.

2. **Thoroughly clean up and rectify companies.** Focus on typical cases of illegal trading, illegal operations, seeking excessive profits, and harming state and public interests, and handle them severely according to law and with great fanfare.

3. **Firmly curb the use of public funds for banquets, gifts, and wasteful spending.** Put an end to the bad practice of some departments being unable to get things done without giving banquets or gifts. Stop the practices of excessive levies, fees, fundraising, sponsorships, and kickbacks.

4. **Seriously rectify urban and rural market order.** Resolutely punish the manufacturers and sellers of fake, shoddy, and inferior goods; severely crack down on price gouging, market bullying, tax evasion, and other illegal activities.

5. **Effectively overcome bureaucratism.** For leaders who, due to dereliction of duty or malpractice, have caused serious losses to the party and the people, serious investigations and punishments must be conducted, and no leniency will be shown.

    本报济南7月8日电　记者贾建舟报道：山东省委围绕贯彻十三届四中全会精神，决心切实办好振奋民心的五件大事，把改革和建设推向前进。
    结合贯彻十三届四中全会精神，山东省委正在努力办好的群众普遍关心的5件实事是：
    一、严肃查处各级领导干部以权谋私、贪污受贿、营私舞弊的案件。对已查实的大案要案，要抓紧处理，绳之以党纪、政纪、法纪，并公布于众；对已发现的大案要案线索，省委常委要分工包案，查个水落石出；对群众举报揭发出来的案件，要迅速组织力量抓紧查处。
    二、彻底清理整顿公司。要抓住倒买倒卖、违法经营、牟取暴利、危害国家和人民利益的典型案例，依法大张旗鼓地严肃处理。
    三、坚决刹住用公款请客送礼、挥霍浪费的歪风。要杜绝有些部门不请客送礼办不成事的恶劣行为。要制止滥摊派、滥收费、滥集资、滥拉“赞助”、滥要“回扣”的歪风。
    四、认真整顿城乡市场秩序。坚决惩治“假、冒、伪、劣”商品的制造者和销售者；对哄抬物价、欺行霸市、偷税漏税等不法行为要予以严厉打击。
    五、切实克服官僚主义。对于因失职、渎职给党和人民造成重大损失的领导干部，要严肃查处，决不姑息。
