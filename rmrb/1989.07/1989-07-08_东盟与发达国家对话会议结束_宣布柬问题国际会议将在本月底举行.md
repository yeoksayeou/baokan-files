Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

The 22nd ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting was held in Brunei from July 3 to 4, followed by the ASEAN and Developed Countries Dialogue Conference, which concluded today.

The French Deputy Foreign Minister, Avis, who is one of the representatives of the European Community, announced in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei, that the international conference on the Cambodian issue is tentatively scheduled to begin on July 30 or 31 in Paris.

Avis said that the purpose of the Paris conference is to seek a comprehensive political solution to the Cambodian issue. Given that China has decided to participate in this international conference, the conference will proceed in a "very positive atmosphere." China's participation is "one of the conditions" for the conference's success.

All countries participating in this dialogue conference in Brunei hope that the Paris conference will make a contribution to the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue, preventing the emergence of "another Afghanistan" where foreign troops withdraw but internal conflicts persist.

Avis told the ASEAN foreign ministers at today's dialogue conference that French President Mitterrand had called Soviet leader Gorbachev, hoping that the Soviet Union would exert influence on Vietnam to ensure the success of the Paris conference.

Today, ASEAN's six countries held dialogues with Japan, New Zealand, and the European Community.

At today's meeting, the Community opposed Australia's proposal to establish an Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation and trade forum.

Community representative Mattutes said that the forum's goal is good, as it helps to strengthen global free trade. However, if the current cooperation form becomes a decision-making body for coordinating trade policies among participating countries, it will violate the spirit and rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, as some countries will be excluded.

Australian Foreign Minister Evans, however, said that the forum is primarily an Asia-Pacific regional forum. However, in the future, the forum will coordinate actions with the Community.

Australia proposed holding a foreign ministers' meeting of relevant countries in November to discuss the specific establishment of the forum. The United States, Canada, Japan, and other countries expressed support. ASEAN countries hold a reserved attitude but are willing to participate in the meeting to discuss some issues.

    东盟与发达国家对话会议结束
    宣布柬问题国际会议将在本月底举行
    新华社北京7月8日电  文莱消息：出席东盟外长与西方发达国家对话会议的法国副外长阿维斯7日在文莱首都斯里巴加湾港宣布，关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议初定于7月30日或31日在巴黎开始举行。
    这位副外长是欧洲共同体的代表之一。
    她说，巴黎会议的目的是寻求柬埔寨问题的全面政治解决，鉴于中国已决定参加这次国际会议，会议将在“非常积极的气氛中”进行，中国的参加是使会议开成功的“条件之一”。
    参加这次文莱对话会议的所有国家都希望巴黎会议能够为全面解决柬埔寨问题而作出贡献，以防止出现外国撤军后、内战不止的“另一个阿富汗”。
    阿维斯在今天的对话会上告诉东盟外长们，法国总统密特朗打电话给苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫，希望苏联对越南施加影响，确保巴黎会议成功。
    第22届东盟外长会议于本月3至4日在文莱举行之后，紧接着便召开东盟和发达国家的对话会议。对话会议于今日结束。
    今天，东盟6国与日本、新西兰和欧洲共同体对话。
    在今天的会议上，共同体反对澳大利亚提出的建立亚太地区经济合作与贸易论坛的主张。
    共同体代表马图特斯说，这一论坛的目的是好的，它有助于加强全球自由贸易。但如果目前这种合作形式变成参加国协调贸易政策的决策机构，它会违背关税及贸易总协定的精神和规则，因为某些国家会被排除在外。
    但澳大利亚外长埃文斯则说，论坛首先是亚太地区性论坛。不过，将来论坛会与共同体协调行动的。
    澳大利亚提议在11月份举行有关国家外长会议，讨论具体建立论坛事宜。美国、加拿大、日本等国表示赞成。东盟国家对此持保留态度，然而，它们准备参加会议，探讨若干问题。
