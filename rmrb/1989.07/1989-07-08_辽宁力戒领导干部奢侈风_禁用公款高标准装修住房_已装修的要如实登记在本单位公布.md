Liaoning Cracks Down on Luxury Spending by Leading Officials, Bans Use of Public Funds for High-End Home Renovations
Already Renovated Homes Must Be Registered and Disclosed to the Public

New China News Agency, Shenyang, July 8 -- The Liaoning Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission and the Provincial Supervision Bureau recently issued a notice strictly prohibiting leading officials from using public funds for high-end home renovations.

The notice states that in recent years, some leading officials in provincial-level units have increasingly used public funds for high-end home renovations, such as installing water heaters, range hoods, ceiling lights, laying carpets, wallpapering, installing suspended ceilings, and using expensive materials to enclose balconies. This extravagant trend has caused public dissatisfaction.

To curb this trend, the notice stipulates:

	1.	Renovation projects currently using public funds for high-end personal home renovations must be immediately stopped. Those already approved and renovated must register the renovation items truthfully and disclose them to the public within the unit; those who conceal important items will not only bear the full cost of the renovation but will also be held accountable, up to and including disciplinary action.

	2.	Those who arbitrarily use public funds for high-end personal home renovations will bear the cost of the renovation items that are not allowed to be renovated according to regulations; those with serious circumstances and malicious means will also be subject to disciplinary action.

	3.	In the future, building design standards must be strictly controlled. No unit is allowed to include renovation costs exceeding the standard in the construction investment. For buildings where the renovation cost has already been included in the construction investment, causing the interior renovation to exceed the standard, the real estate management department should implement differential rents and appropriately increase the rent.

    辽宁力戒领导干部奢侈风  禁用公款高标准装修住房
    已装修的要如实登记在本单位公布
    新华社沈阳7月8日电　辽宁省纪委、省监察厅日前发出通知，严禁领导干部动用公款高标准装修住房。
    通知说，近一两年来，在省直属单位中，少数领导干部动用公款高标准装修住房问题日渐突出，如安装热水器、吸油烟机、吸顶灯，铺地毯、贴壁纸、吊天棚，用贵重材料封闭阳台等。这种奢侈之风，引起了群众的不满。
    为了煞住这股歪风，通知规定：
    正在用公款高标准装修个人住房的工程，必须立即停止。经批准已装修的，装修项目如实登记，向本单位的群众公开；对隐瞒重要项目的，除负担全部装修费用外，还要追究其责任直至给予纪律处分。
    凡擅自动用公款高标准装修个人住房的，除按规定可以装修的以外，其余项目所耗的费用由个人负担；情节严重、手段恶劣的还要给予纪律处分。
    今后建房在设计标准上要从严掌握。任何单位不得把超过标准的装修费列入基建投资。在建房时已把装修费列入基建投资，使室内装修超出标准的，房产管理部门应实行级差房租，适当提高房租。
