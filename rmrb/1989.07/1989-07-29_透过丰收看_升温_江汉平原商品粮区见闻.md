The warming of agriculture is a particularly important task in this year's rectification and adjustment. How has this task been implemented at the grassroots level? Recently, reporters visited the key commercial grain area of Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province and found that the summer grain harvest this year is gratifying, but there are still many problems, and the achievements of the warming should not be overestimated. To ensure a bumper autumn harvest, efforts must be redoubled.

A local cadre put it well: the harvest was achieved through both work factors and climatic factors, and "harvest" and "warming" should not be equated.

After the Central Rural Work Conference last year, agriculture in the Jianghan Plain, like the rest of the country, showed signs of improvement: the leadership of agriculture at all levels was strengthened; the scale of agricultural water conservancy construction last winter and this spring was unprecedented in recent years; the promotion of effective scientific and technological measures for increasing production accelerated; the area of grain sowing expanded, and the quality of field management improved, and so on. However, due to the influence of internal and external environments, several major measures for developing agriculture formulated at the conference have not been implemented ideally here.

As a comprehensive indicator of the warming, agricultural fund investment this year has not increased significantly. Almost everywhere the reporters visited, they heard calls for "lack of money to buy production materials." A cadre from the Zongxiang County Supply and Marketing Cooperative said that a rare phenomenon has occurred here: fertilizers and pesticides are in short supply on the one hand, but they cannot be sold on the other. By the end of March, the total value of agricultural supplies in this county increased by 80 million yuan compared to the same period last year. They analyzed that the main reasons for the lack of funds for farmers to invest are threefold: first, a considerable amount of white receipts issued for the purchase of agricultural and sideline products last autumn have not been redeemed; second, the actual amount of pre-purchase deposits and agricultural loans issued to farmers has decreased compared to previous years; third, due to the closure of the grain market, farmers still have a batch of surplus grain at home that has not been sold for cash. According to incomplete statistics from 12 counties and cities in the Jianghan Plain, 7.5 billion yuan in white receipts were issued to farmers last year, and only over 5 billion yuan had been redeemed by the end of March this year. The pre-purchase deposits and agricultural loans for grain and cotton were supposed to increase significantly according to the plan, but this money has been diverted, withheld by various names, or cannot be released due to bank debts. The Jingzhou region, located in the heart of the Jianghan Plain, was supposed to issue 145 million yuan in pre-purchase deposits to farmers this spring, but only 100 million yuan had been issued by the beginning of April. According to the provincial agricultural department, at the beginning of the year, it was proposed to establish an agricultural development fund with a total amount of 140 million yuan from seven aspects, but most of it has not been implemented so far.

After the implementation of the exclusive operation of major production materials such as fertilizers and pesticides, the chaotic situation in circulation has been greatly improved, but some new problems have also emerged. Hubei Province has 66 small nitrogen fertilizer plants, of which 29 stopped production and 37 were half-closed in the first two months of this year due to power and coal shortages. Although production began to recover in March, it was still under capacity. Thus, the amount of fertilizer supplied to rural areas in the first half of the year will be reduced by more than 300,000 tons compared to the original plan, further widening the supply gap in various counties and cities. According to calculations by Tianmen City, even with the addition of purchases from other places, the amount of fertilizer this year will still be reduced by about 10% compared to previous years. The problem with pesticides is even more serious. Not only is the quantity insufficient, but there are also many counterfeit and substandard products, and the variety is incomplete. Commonly used varieties such as DDT and insecticides are basically out of stock in many places. A cadre from the Jingmen City Agricultural Commission lamented that this year the city's grain sowing area is 1.6 million mu, and according to the general rate of pest occurrence, at least 12,000 tons of pesticides are needed. Purchases were made as early as the beginning of the year, but only half have been bought so far.

In the face of severe financial difficulties, the state decided to increase the price of contracted grain purchases and increase the amount of fertilizers linked to contracts. This was supposed to be a solid warming measure this year, and rural cadres and farmers were once excited about it, but now they are somewhat disappointed due to the price increases of production materials.

At the same time as the grain price was increased by 18%, the prices of fertilizers, pesticides, water, and electricity increased by an even greater margin. A representative of the Hubei Provincial People's Congress, Secretary of the Party Branch of Wangli Village in Zongxiang County, Gao Lianzhen, did the math for the reporter: the village can earn an additional 200,000 yuan from the grain price increase, but it will have to spend an additional 250,000 yuan due to the price increase of agricultural production materials. The benefits brought by the grain price increase are offset, and it will still cost an additional 50,000 yuan. The amount of fertilizer linked to 50 kg of contracted grain increased from 7.5 kg to 15 kg, but there is a catch. Only 2.5 kg of the increased amount is at the official price, and the rest is at the market price or half-market price, with little difference between linked and unlinked.

It is particularly noteworthy that the Jianghan Plain, which enjoys excellent natural conditions and provides 2 billion kg of commercial grain annually, many comrades do not regard grain production as their special advantage, but rather as a heavy burden on their backs. To be precise, they have political motivation to increase grain production but lack internal interest incentives.

In recent years, although the state has increased investment in commercial grain bases, some historical policies have not been adjusted or cannot be adjusted immediately due to conditions. For example, the interest on funds used to purchase grain is paid by the producing area, the market price exceeding the state-regulated price for market-priced grain purchased on the spot is subsidized by the producing area, and a large part of the cost of storing and transporting grain is borne by the producing area, etc. As a result, the situation of "whipping the fast cow" has been created, the more grain a place produces and contributes, the heavier its financial burden. Zongxiang County, which has been evaluated as a national advanced grain-selling county with an annual commercial grain delivery of over 300 million kg, has accumulated a grain deficit of 21.04 million yuan from 1982 to 1988. This year, due to factors such as the bank's increase in the interest rate for purchasing grain funds and the increase in the purchase-sale price subsidy, the deficit will further increase to over 30 million yuan, equivalent to the county's total financial revenue. This means that even if the county does not carry out any construction projects and all administrative and public institutions close their doors, it will still not fill this hole.

The above-mentioned issues, from fund investment to considering the interests of commercial grain-producing areas, are all problems that urgently need to be solved in the warming of agriculture. It can be seen that the warming task is still arduous, and what has been done is only the beginning. It is absolutely not permissible to relax due to the summer grain harvest. Otherwise, it will not be conducive to achieving a bumper harvest for the whole year, let alone reaching a "new level." Many comrades here have expressed that in the warming work, some belong to the national macro-environment, and some belong to the local micro-environment. As comrades working in the locality, we should not wait or observe passively, but should be proactive and work hard to create a micro-environment and contribute to improving the macro-environment. It can be said that this correct attitude and spirit towards the relationship between "big" and "small" are very commendable.

    透过丰收看“升温”
    ——江汉平原商品粮区见闻
    新华社记者　詹仲德　赵华胄
    农业“升温”，是今年治理整顿中一项特别重要的任务。这项任务在基层落实得怎样呢？记者最近走访了重点商品粮区湖北省江汉平原，深感今年夏粮丰收令人高兴，但问题依然不少，“升温”成绩不能估计过高。为夺取今年秋季丰收，工作仍须加劲。
    一位乡干部说得好：丰收的取得，有工作因素，也有气候因素，不能把“丰收”和“升温”等同起来。
    去年中央农村工作会议之后，江汉平原的农业同全国一样，呈现出可喜转机：各级干部对农业生产的领导加强了；去冬今春的农田水利建设规模为近几年所少见；一些行之有效的科技增产措施推广步伐加快；粮食播种面积扩大，田间管理质量提高，等等。但是，由于内外环境的影响，这次会议制定的几项发展农业的重大措施在这里落实得还不够理想。
    作为“升温”的一个综合指标农业资金投入，今年没有明显增加。记者所到之处，几乎都听到“缺钱买生产资料”的呼吁。钟祥县供销社同志说，这里出现了多年没有见过的怪现象：化肥、农药一面叫缺，一面又卖不出去。这个县3月末的农资库存总值比去年同期增加800万元。他们分析，农民缺少资金投入的主要原因有三：一是去年秋天收购农副产品打的白条还有相当数量未能兑现；二是实际发放农民手上的预购定金和农业贷款比往年减少；三是因粮食市场关闭，农民家中还有一批余粮没有卖出变为现金。据江汉平原12个县市不完全统计，去年累计给农民打白条7.5亿元。到今年3月底才兑现5亿多元。粮棉预购定金和农业贷款按计划应有较大幅度的增加，但是这笔钱有的被挪用，有的被五花八门的名目所扣留，有的因银行负债拿不出来。位于江汉平原腹地的荆州地区，今年春季应向农民发放预购定金1.45亿元，到4月上旬才发放1000万元。据省农业部门反映，年初提出全省从7个方面建立总金额达1.4亿元的农业发展基金，迄今大部分没有落实。
    对化肥、农药等主要生产资料实行专营以后，流通中的混乱现象大为改观，但也出现了一些新的问题。湖北省共有66家小氮肥厂，今年1—2月因缺电缺煤有29家停产，37家半停产。3月份虽开始恢复生产，仍然开工不足。这样上半年向农村提供的化肥要比原计划减少30多万吨，不得不加大各县、市供应量的缺口。据天门市测算，即使加上到外地采购，今年化肥也要比往年减少10％左右。农药问题更大，不但数量不足，伪劣货多，而且品种不全，像敌敌畏、杀虫味等常用品种在不少地方基本上断档脱销。荆门市农委同志发愁说，今年全市粮食播种面积160万亩，按一般病虫害发生率计算，至少需要农药1200吨，年初就派人四处采购，到现在才买到一半。
    国家在财政十分困难的情况下，决定提高合同定购粮食价格，增加挂钩化肥数量，这本是今年过得硬的两项“升温”措施，农村干部和农民都曾为此高兴了一阵，但是现在却因为生产资料涨价而有些失望。
    在粮食提价18％的同时，化肥、农药、水费、电费等以更大的幅度上涨。湖北省人大代表、钟祥县汪李村支部书记高联贞给记者算了一笔帐：这个村因粮食提价可增收20万元，因农用生产资料涨价要多支25万元，粮食提价带来的好处被抵销不算，还要倒贴5万元。每50公斤定购粮挂钩化肥由7.5公斤增加到15公斤也有水份。主要是增加的那部分，只有国家给的2.5公斤是平价的，其余地方给的是议价和半议价，挂和不挂差别不大。
    特别引人注意的是，自然条件得天独厚、年提供20亿公斤商品粮的江汉平原，许多同志竟不把产粮看成是自己的特殊优势，反而认为是一个背在身上的沉重包袱。确切地说，他们对增产粮食只有政治动力，缺少内在的利益刺激。
    近几年，虽然国家增加了对商品粮基地的投资，但历史上遗留下来的某些政策，还没来得及或者因条件限制不能马上进行调整。如收购粮食所用资金的利息由产区支付，随行就市收购的议价粮，市价超过国家规定的部分由产区补贴，保管、调拨粮食费用很大部分由产区负担等等，结果造成“鞭打快牛”的局面，哪个地方产粮多、贡献大，哪个地方财政负担加重。年交售商品粮3亿多公斤、被评为全国售粮先进县的钟祥县，1982年至1988年，粮食累计亏损2104万元，今年由于银行提高购粮资金利息，购销差价补贴增多等因素，亏损额将进一步增加到3000多万元，相当于这个县的全部财政收入。这意味着即使全县一项建设不搞，所有行政事业单位关门，也填不满这个窟窿。
    以上所说，从资金投入到照顾商品粮产区利益，哪一样不是农业升温中亟待解决的问题。可见“升温”任务还很艰巨，已经做的仅仅是一个开端，绝不能因夏粮丰收而稍有懈怠。否则，不利于夺取全年丰收，更谈不上登“新的台阶”。这里的很多同志表示，在升温工作中，有些属于国家的大环境，有些属于地方的“小气候”。作为在地方工作的同志，应当不等待、不观望，积极主动，在创造小气候上下功夫，为改善大环境做贡献，应当说这种正确对待“大”和“小”的指导思想和精神状态很值得提倡。
