Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd.

	The sales volume of domestically produced sedans in China has significantly decreased in the first half of this year, and the parking lots of sedan manufacturing enterprises are now filled with unsold cars. According to industry insiders, if this situation is not addressed promptly, factories will start to halt production.

	The main reasons for the severe backlog of sedans are as follows: First, sales outlets across the country have been significantly reduced. There were originally over 300 sales points, but now only 49 points are selling sedans. Second, this year, the state decided to allocate 7,440 sedans to the Materials Department, but these cars have not yet been ordered by the factories. As products allocated by the state's mandatory plan, if the Materials Department does not take delivery, the enterprises cannot sell them independently, leaving them to accumulate in storage. Third, the production plan for sedans is repeatedly researched and decided by the state, with the assembly plan for imported parts being determined by the State Council's executive meeting. However, due to the reduction in the purchasing power of social groups, the number of people going to factories to buy cars has sharply decreased, leading to an imbalance between production and sales for enterprises, resulting in product backlogs.

	In view of the above serious situation, the automobile industry urges and suggests that relevant state departments quickly study effective measures to address the problems of the rapid increase in sedan inventory and the severe occupation of funds in the automobile industry.

    轿车库存严重积压
    汽车业呼吁疏通销售渠道
    本报北京7月3日讯　记者刘国胜报道：今年上半年，我国国产轿车销售量明显下降，生产轿车企业的停车场地现已放满待销汽车。据汽车业有关人士称，这种情况如不及时解决，各工厂将相继停产。
    造成小轿车严重积压的主要原因是：一、各地销售点大量压缩，原有网点300余家，现在只有49个点经销轿车。二、今年国家决定调拨给物资部门分配的7440辆轿车资源，至今未到工厂订货。作为国家指令性计划调出的产品，物资部门不提货，企业又不能自销，只好压在库里。三、小轿车的生产计划是由国家反复研究决定的，其中进口散件组装计划是国务院办公会议确定的，但由于压缩社会集团购买力，造成去工厂购车者锐减，企业产销不平衡，产品积压。
    鉴于上述严重情况，汽车业呼吁并建议国家有关部门尽快研究得力措施，解决汽车工业轿车库存急剧增加、资金严重占压等问题。
