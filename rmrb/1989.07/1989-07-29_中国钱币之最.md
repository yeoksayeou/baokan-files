The Coin with the Longest Usage: Wu Shu Five-Zhu Money
The Wu Shu Five-Zhu coin was created during the fifth year of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty's Yuanxiu era (118 BC). It was used throughout the Western Han, Eastern Han, Three Kingdoms, Jin dynasties, Southern and Northern Dynasties, and the Sui Dynasty, totaling 739 years. Therefore, it is known as the "Long-Life Coin." This coin set the standard for shape and weight, with each coin weighing approximately 4 grams. This standard was adopted by subsequent coins and was nearly 200 years ahead of the Asian coin standard.

The Earliest Iron Coin
The earliest iron coin is often attributed to Gongsun Shu. However, iron coins actually appeared about 100 years before Gongsun Shu. According to reports in "Wenwu" and "Kaogu Xuebao," in 1956, 320 pieces of Western Han four-zhu half-liang iron coins were unearthed in Hengyang. In 1960, 33 pieces of iron half-liang coins were also unearthed from a Western Han tomb in Changsha, Hunan. These archaeological finds completely refute the claim that Gongsun Shu was the first to cast iron coins, indicating that iron coins were already in use by the mid-Western Han period.

The Lightest Coin
The so-called "Goose-Eye Coin" refers to coins that are small in size, resembling a goose's eye. These coins were popular during the Liu Song Dynasty. People at that time described these coins as "1,000 coins not reaching an inch in length, sinking in water, and easily breaking." These poor-quality coins, with "100,000 coins not filling a handful," fully reflect the chaotic situation at the time and can be considered the lightest type of coin.

### 中国钱币之最

    中国钱币之最
    使用时间最长的钱　五铢钱诞生于汉武帝元狩5年（公元前118年），历经西汉、东汉、三国、两晋、南北朝、隋等，共739年，因此称该钱为“长寿钱”。该钱在形制重量等方面首开标准化之首，每枚钱重4克左右，并为后来钱币沿用，比亚细亚钱币标准制早近200年。
    最早的铁钱　最早的铁钱人们都从“公孙述所说”。其实，最早的铁钱比公孙述早100年左右，据《文物》、《考古学报》介绍1956年衡阳曾出土西汉四铢半两多达320枚，1960年湖南长沙西汉墓也出土33枚铁半两钱。这些文物的出土完全否定公孙述最早铸造铁钱的说法。说明铁钱的铸造至少在西汉中期已经出现。
    最轻的钱　所谓鹅眼钱，即言钱型较小如鹅眼，流行于刘宋时期，当时人们称该钱：1000钱长不到一寸，“入水不沉、随手破碎”。这些劣钱，“10万钱不盈一掬”，充分反映了当时混乱局面，可称之钱币中最轻的一种吧。
