In the shattered lands of China, thunder lurks beneath the surface. With a mighty arm raised and a gunshot echoing, dragons soar and tigers leap. Clearing the way through thorns and briars, the force to pioneer and conquer is boundless. The sky is torn asunder, and the phoenix is bound. Seeing Zhou Gong, eager to strategize and plan, devising wise tactics.

A single spark ignites a vast blaze. Swift horses are driven, and sharp blades are wielded. Praise the boundary struggles, sweeping away dust and evil. Ten thousand heroic troops march north, fighting for eight years to drive out the invaders. Joyous clouds fill the sky, shining brightly upon the world, a song of triumph.

Notes:
① Boundary refers to the border between Hunan and Jiangxi in the Luoxiao Mountains.
② Ten thousand heroic troops refer to the Central Red Army.

    纪念八一建军节
    满江红
    李真
    破碎山河，神州里、惊雷隐伏。伸巨臂、一声枪响，龙腾虎跃。斩棘披荆开拓力，掀天揭地魮鹏缚。见周公、正急切运筹，谋良策。
    星星火，光万索。驱快骥，操利锷。颂边界割据①，扫尘除恶。十万雄师齐北上②，八年抗战驱穷寇。喜霞天，光灿照人寰，朝天乐。
    注：①边界，指罗霄山的湘赣边界。
    ②十万雄师，指中央红军。
