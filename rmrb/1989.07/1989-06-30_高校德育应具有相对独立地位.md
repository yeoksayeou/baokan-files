In recent years, in some regions and colleges, moral education has faced issues such as "theory not being effective, low status, unstable team, weak work, and poor results." Consequently, political work teams have experienced instability, with many members seeking alternative paths or leaving. This has led to a situation where few remain, and some have referred to it as the "Great Escape of Political Work Cadres."

The causes of this situation are multifaceted, but to change it, we must first address the issue of college moral education having a relatively independent status.

Overcoming Several Negative Views That Weaken the Status of Moral Education

First, there is the view of "subordination." Some believe that school moral education is subordinate to intellectual education and serves it, with moral education's role and status being reflected in serving and ensuring the implementation and completion of intellectual education. They advocate for "intellectual education as the center" for conducting moral education. I believe this view is one-sided because "subordination" essentially treats moral education as an optional "appendage." Once intellectual education is implemented and progresses, then moral education is considered complete. We must recognize that in our socialist country, school education is not centered around "intellectual education" but around educating people, which means not only developing students' intellectual abilities but also ensuring their overall development in moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic aspects. Of course, we do not deny the service and guarantee role of moral education for intellectual education, but we cannot reduce it to merely serving intellectual education. Moral education plays a unique, heavy, and irreplaceable role in intellectual education. If moral education is subordinated to intellectual education, many issues beyond intellectual education will not be addressed, and students may become mentally and psychologically unbalanced. Upon graduation, they may not adapt to societal needs, which would be a serious mistake in school education.

Second, there is the view of "replacing morality with law." This is the view that legal governance should replace moral governance and education. Some advocate that universities only need police stations and public security departments. Those who violate the law should be handled by the public security department, and those who do not violate the law do not need to be managed. There is no need to establish thought political work institutions and full-time personnel. Obviously, this view of abandoning moral governance and education in favor of legal governance is baseless. To achieve governance by law, we must educate people to know and abide by the law, raising their moral and cultural standards. This requires strengthening moral education and governance. For young students, only when their ideological awareness and moral standards are raised can they increase their awareness of abiding by laws and regulations, maintaining the authority of the law. If moral education and governance are abandoned, and students are left unattended, reducing their moral standards to just not violating the law, this is contrary to the cultivation goals of a socialist university. We must not forget that students are the recipients of education. If moral education is abandoned in favor of legal governance, the meaning of education is lost.

Third, there is the view of "replacing morality with intellect." This is the view that intellectual education should replace moral education. The Soviet educator Krupisky believed: "Schools, while arming the new generation with knowledge, also form their worldview and moral character, cultivating their communist behavior." This is a typical representative of "replacing morality with intellect." We also have many who believe that schools only need intellectual teachers who can handle "teaching and educating," without the need for moral education teachers. This is essentially a form of "replacing morality with intellect." We say that spreading knowledge helps improve a person's cultural and moral standards. Generally, people with higher cultural levels also have higher moral standards, but the two cannot be equated, and intellectual education cannot replace moral education. Although intellectual teachers should bear the responsibility of "teaching and educating," they cannot take over all moral education tasks. Because the students cultivated by colleges must uphold and adhere to the four cardinal principles, uphold and adhere to reform and opening up, and must possess high moral qualities and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, these are not tasks that intellectual education alone can complete. Moreover, college students have a broad knowledge base, quick thinking, are good at thinking, and daring to explore, often encountering and raising various "advanced" questions about politics, theory, social trends, party lines, and policies. Many of these questions are beyond the scope of general intellectual teachers to answer. Therefore, replacing morality with intellect is not realistic or possible.

Fourth, there is the view of "neutralization." This is the view that "small environment" cannot overcome "big environment," and school influence cannot overcome social influence. Some say that six days of school education cannot match one day of social influence. Indeed, young students' thoughts are greatly influenced by society and family, and some Western trends and negative social winds can easily have negative effects on students. This phenomenon of school education being neutralized by negative social factors is objectively present. But some people therefore develop a pessimistic "neutralization" and "helplessness" mentality, losing confidence in the role and combat effectiveness of school moral education, believing that school moral education is "wasting effort, laboring in vain, and only listening to nature." This is groundless. We should see that although the negative factors in society on young students cannot be underestimated, school moral education has a greater advantage over social influence. Because schools have a strong teaching force, a good educational environment, and systematically, organized, and purposefully conduct ideological education on students, school moral education is in a proactive position. It can utilize positive factors in society to educate students and adopt the method of "preemptive strike" to prevent and resist negative influences from society and family.

The Necessity of Moral Education Having a Relatively Independent Status

First, from the perspective of school tasks and educational laws, in a class society, education is the process of imparting certain ideological concepts and knowledge skills to the educated according to the will of the ruling class. This reveals the nature of education and points out its tasks. The independent status of school moral education is determined by the nature and characteristics of education. Because moral education is a direct manifestation of the will of the ruling class in a class society. In our country, the current stage of higher education is to cultivate students into all-around developed talents who meet the needs of socialist modernization construction according to the will of the proletariat and the working people. Moral education mainly involves Marxist theoretical education, situation and task education, ideological and political education, moral quality education, and legal education. Only by giving moral education a relatively independent status and having specialized research offices and moral education teacher teams can we take on these tasks with a high sense of responsibility. Otherwise, it is impossible to complete them. Higher education moral education, intellectual education, and physical education are three educations that are interrelated and mutually promoting, with moral education playing a leading and directional role.

Second, from the perspective of the physiological and psychological characteristics of young students, contemporary college students are between 17 and 23 years old, in the early and middle stages of youth. They are physically adults and psychologically semi-adults. Some young students have strong closed and rebellious psychological tendencies, adopting indifferent, evasive, and resistant attitudes towards education. The physiological and psychological characteristics of young students determine that schools must strengthen ideological education and psychological health guidance, and determine that moral education must have a relatively independent status to help young students who are in the process of forming their worldviews and outlooks on life to find direction and solve problems.

Third, from the perspective of the social environment, currently, college students' psychological and ideological states face impacts from four aspects: first, the impact of the development of a commodity economy; second, the impact of Western trends; third, the impact of negative social winds; fourth, the impact of mass media. Some impacts have overturned outdated and corrupt concepts in traditional culture, establishing new thoughts and concepts suitable for social development, such as the concepts of efficiency, time, competition, innovation, and democracy. Some impacts have overturned correct and traditional thoughts and concepts that should be inherited and carried forward, producing negative psychological states, such as pursuing enjoyment, material interests, and high consumption, "me-first," "money-first," advocating "sexual liberation," and advocating bourgeois liberalization. As pointed out in the report of the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China: "In the primary stage, before we shake off the state of underdevelopment, the thought of bourgeois liberalization that denies the socialist system and advocates the capitalist system will long exist." Therefore, this social environment determines the multidimensionality and complexity of young students' thoughts, and also determines the importance and arduousness of ideological and political work, which cannot be dispensed with.

Fourth, from the perspective of the current state of young students, contemporary college students were born in the "ten years of turmoil," grew up in the period of rectifying the chaos, and studied in the period of reform and opening up. They have witnessed the mistakes of our party in its work since childhood, the gap between our country's economy and people's living standards with developed countries abroad, and personally experienced the development and changes in our country's politics and economy after reform and opening up, and the forward strides of socialist modernization construction. This special environment has cultivated many precious qualities in contemporary college students, such as broad knowledge, keen thinking, diligence in thinking, support for reform, opposition to conservatism, thirst for knowledge, and determination to succeed; but it also has many obvious and unignorable shortcomings and weaknesses, such as many students lacking practical training, lacking the spirit of hard struggle, having relatively radical thinking methods, and sometimes adopting a nihilistic attitude towards history.

Conditions for Establishing the Relatively Independent Status of Moral Education

For a school's moral education work to have a relatively independent status, the following conditions must be met.

1. School leaders and teachers at all levels must establish correct educational ideas. They must clearly understand that the school is centered around "educating people" and aims to cultivate all-around developed talents who meet the needs of the "three orientations." Moral education is an important link in "educating people" and realizing the cultivation goals, playing a leading and directional role, and cannot be dispensed with for a moment. School and department leaders should place moral education work on the important agenda, seriously study it several times each semester, and have plans, arrangements, and inspections.

2. Establish a leadership system and teaching institutions for moral education. School moral education is a broad concept, including political theory course education, moral education, and daily ideological and political education. All these educations must be closely combined with the current situation, combined with the cultivation goals, and combined with the actual thoughts of students. Whether in content or methods, they have greater flexibility and stronger pertinence compared to other professional courses, with higher requirements and greater difficulty. Therefore, it cannot be limited to general calls, and specialized institutions must lead this work and establish various moral education research offices. For example, a student ideological education leadership group jointly managed by the party and the government can be established, with specialized functional departments (student work department, student affairs office) set up under it. Political theory course research office, moral education research office, situation and task research office, current affairs and policy research office, youth psychology research office, and professional ethics research office can be established. All moral education teachers should be assigned to one or two research offices.

3. Establish a specialized moral education teacher team. All teachers and cadres who specialize in student ideological and political education and daily moral education are moral education teachers and should be given the same treatment as other teachers. The title of student political work cadre and political instructor should be abolished, and all should be changed to moral education teacher. Moral education teachers have four functions: ① serve as student counselors or class advisors, responsible for the daily ideological education of a grade or class of students; ② teaching work, through opening compulsory or elective courses and lectures in the field of moral education, conducting ideological and political education and theoretical education for students, and completing the teaching tasks assigned by the research office; ③ research work, mainly researching the characteristics of young students and the content, methods, and laws of ideological education work, with certain research results each year; ④ consultation work, schools can open student ideological and psychological consultation service "clinics," answering students' questions about love, interpersonal relationships, moral character, mental hygiene, and ideological and political aspects. Moral education teachers should be experts in one or a few aspects of the "clinic," helping students solve difficult problems.

4. Establish a system and network for moral education. School moral education should be carried out throughout the entire process of students' stay in school. Different moral education teaching plans should be formulated according to the characteristics of students in different grades. In addition to political theory courses that already have plans, other aspects should also be scientifically arranged. For example, for first-year students, emphasis can be placed on legal education, moral norms education, and life outlook education; for second and third-year students, emphasis can be placed on patriotism and revolutionary tradition education, love education; for senior students, emphasis can be placed on professional ethics education, etc. In addition, different education contents and methods should be formulated for students at different levels. For example, for students who are party members or active candidates for party membership, higher requirements and deeper content should be set, striving to cultivate them into young Marxists and communist fighters. For those students who are usually lax in discipline, have low requirements, and are indifferent to learning, and have poor moral cultivation, a separate moral education plan should be formulated, paying attention to strengthening their basic civic education. School moral education should also compile teaching outlines and textbooks, with clear purposes, plans, and requirements, combining teacher lectures with student self-study and discussions. However, moral education teaching work should be based on pertinence and practicality, not limited to textbooks, and should not become purely theoretical courses.

5. Establish a moral education assessment system. The implementation and effectiveness of school moral education work should be assessed. Student assessments include two aspects: one is the assessment of moral education theory knowledge, such as political theory courses, moral education courses, and legal education courses; the other is the assessment of moral behavior, such as political attitudes, learning attitudes, organizational discipline, collective views, moral cultivation, unity among classmates, thrift, and labor hygiene. Different types of schools and different grades can establish different assessment indicator systems. Moral education assessments should be conducted every semester or academic year, along with the comprehensive assessment of students' qualities, and the results should be recorded in the grade book and directly linked to the evaluation of scholarships, excellent students, and the optimal allocation of graduates. Only by implementing moral education assessments can the status of moral education be consolidated, avoiding the situation of "can listen or not listen, can do or not do," thus maintaining the authority of moral education and enhancing its effectiveness. In addition, schools and moral education teachers should also be assessed, that is, moral education evaluation, to inspect the implementation of moral education work and promote the development of moral education work.

    高校德育应具有相对独立地位
    上海市高等教育研究所　杨德广
    近几年来，在部分地区和高等学校的德育工作中，不同程度地存在着“理论不灵、地位不高、队伍不稳、工作不力、效果不好”的状况，因此，导致政工队伍思想不稳，动荡不安，没有心思做工作，纷纷留后路，找出路。结果是：走的走，散的散，所剩无几，有人称之为“政工干部胜利大逃亡！”
    造成这一状况的原因是多方面的，要改变这种状况，首先必须解决高等学校的德育应具有相对独立地位的问题。
    克服几个削弱德育地位的消极观点
    一是“从属论”的观点。有些同志认为，学校德育是从属于智育、服务于智育的，德育的地位和作用体现在为智育服务、保证智育的落实和完成上，主张“以智育为中心”开展德育。我认为这种观点是片面的，因为“从属论”实际上是把德育当作可有可无的“附庸”，一旦智育落实了，上去了，那么德育工作就做好了，完成了。应该看到，在我们社会主义国家，学校教育工作不是“以智育为中心”，而是以育人为中心，即不仅仅培养学生在智能方面的发展，而必须在德智体美各方面都得到发展。当然，我们不否定德育对智育的服务和保证作用，但决不能由此而降低到只是为智育服务的地位。德育在育人中有其特殊的、繁重的、而智育又不能替代的作用，如果把德育从属于智育，非智育以外的大量问题就得不到解决，学生将在思想上、心理上成为一个不健全的人，毕业后就不可能适应社会的需要，这将是学校教育工作的严重失误。
    二是“以法代德”的观点。就是以法治代替德治和德育的观点。有人主张：大学里只要设派出所、公安处就行，凡是违法者由公安部门处理，不违法者就不必去管，没有必要设立思想政治工作机构和专职人员。显然，这种放弃德治和德育的法治，是没有基础的。因为要实现以法治国，就必须教育人们知法、守法，提高人们的思想品德修养和文明程度，这就要首先加强德育和德治。对青年学生来说，只有当他们的思想觉悟和道德水准提高后，才能增强遵纪守法的自觉性，才能维护法律的权威性。如果放弃德育和德治，对学生放任不管，仅仅把他们的思想道德水准降低到不违法的基点，这是与社会主义大学的培养目标相悖离的。我们不能忘记学生是受教育者，倘若放弃德育只靠法治，就失去了办教育的意义。
    三是“以智代德”的观点。就是主张以智育代替德育。苏联教育家凯洛夫认为：“学校在用知识武装新生一代的同时，就形成了学生的世界观和道德面貌，培养了他们的共产主义行为”。这是“以智代德”的典型代表。我们也有不少同志认为，学校里只有智育教师就可以了，他们担负“教书育人”的任务，不必有德育教师，实际上这也是一种“以智代德”。我们说，传播知识有助于提高人的文明程度和思想品德修养，一般来说，文化程度高的人，品德修养也较高，但二者不能划等号，更不能以智育代替德育。固然智育教师应担负起“教书育人”的职责，应在教学过程中进行思想教育工作，但毕竟不能包办代替全部德育任务。因为高等学校培养出来的学生，必须拥护和坚持四项基本原则，拥护和坚持改革、开放，必须具有高尚的道德品质和全心全意为人民服务的精神，这些并非智育本身所能完成的。另外，大学生知识面广，思维敏捷，善于思考，勇于探索，往往会遇到和提出各种各样关于政治、理论、社会思潮、党的路线、政策等方面的“尖端”问题，不少问题是一般智育教师回答不了的。因此以智代德是不现实、不可能的。
    四是“抵消论”的观点。即认为“小气候”抵不过“大气候”，学校影响抵不过社会影响。有的同志说，学校六天教育，不如社会一天影响。的确，青年学生的思想受社会和家庭的制约性很大，尤其是一些西方思潮、社会上不正之风很容易在学生中产生消极作用，这种学校教育与社会消极因素相抵消的现象是客观存在的。但有些人因此而产生“抵消论”、“无能为力论”的悲观情绪，对学校德育的作用和战斗力失去信心，认为学校德育是“白费力气，吃力不讨好，只得听其自然”，这是没有根据的。应该看到，尽管社会上的消极因素对青年学生的影响不可低估，但是学校德育比之社会影响有较大的优势，因为学校里有较强的师资力量，有良好的教育环境，而且是有计划、有组织、有目的地对学生进行思想教育，学校德育处于主动的地位，可以利用社会中的积极因素施教于学生，可采取“先入为主”的办法，预防、抵制来自社会、家庭的消极影响。
    学校德育相对独立的必要性
    首先，从学校任务和教育规律看，在阶级社会里，教育是按照统治阶级的意志，对受教育者施予一定的思想观念以及传授知识技能的社会现象，这里既揭示了教育的性质，又点出了教育的任务。学校德育的独立地位，正是由教育的性质和特点决定的，因为德育是阶级社会统治阶级意志直接的体现。在我国，现阶段的高等教育就是要按照无产阶级和劳动人民的意志，把学生培养成德智体全面发展的、适应社会主义四化建设需要的合格人才。德育，主要对学生进行马克思主义理论教育、形势任务教育、思想政治教育、道德品质教育、法制教育等，只有赋予德育相对独立的地位，有专门的教研室和德育教师队伍，才能以高度的责任感担当起这些任务，否则是不可能完成的。高等学校德育、智育、体育是三育并举，互相联系、互相促进的，而德育起主导和方向性的作用。
    第二，从青年学生的生理和心理特点看，当代大学生在17岁至23岁之间，正处于青年的前期和中期，他们是生理上的成人，心理上的准成人，一部分青年学生闭锁心理、逆反心理较强，对教育采取冷淡、回避、抵触的态度。青年学生的生理、心理特点，决定学校必须加强思想教育和心理健康的指导工作，决定德育必须具有相对独立的地位，以帮助正处于世界观、人生观形成过程中的青年学生指明方向，排忧解难。
    第三，从社会环境来看，目前，大学生的心理、思想状态面临来自四方面的冲击：一是商品经济发展的冲击，二是西方思潮的冲击，三是社会上不正之风的冲击，四是大众传播媒介的冲击。有些是冲击了传统中陈旧、腐朽的观念，树立了适应社会发展的新思想、新观念，如效益观念、时间观念、竞争观念、创新意识、民主意识等。有些是冲击了传统中正确的、应继承发扬的思想观念，产生了消极的思想心理状态，如贪图享乐、追求物质利益和高消费、“以我为中心”、“一切向钱看”、提倡“性解放”、主张资产阶级自由化等。正如党的十三大报告中指出的：“在初级阶段，在我们尚未摆脱不发达状态之前，否定社会主义制度，主张资本主义制度的资产阶级自由化思想将长期存在”，因此，这种社会环境就决定了青年学生思想的多维性、复杂性，也决定了思想政治工作的重要性、艰巨性，不可或缺。
    第四，从青年学生的现状看，当代大学生是“生在十年动乱时期，长在拨乱反正时期，学在改革开放时期”，他们从小就耳闻目睹到我们党在工作中的失误，我国的经济和人民的生活水平与国外发达国家的差距，也亲自感受到改革开放后我国在政治经济上的发展变化，社会主义现代化建设的前进步伐。这种特殊的环境，造就了当代大学生许多可贵的优点，如知识面广，思想敏锐，勤于思考，拥护改革，反对守旧，渴求知识，立志成才等；但是也存在不少明显的不可忽视的缺点和弱点，如许多学生缺乏实践锻炼，缺乏艰苦奋斗精神，思想方法比较偏激，有时对历史采取虚无主义态度等。
    确定德育相对独立地位的条件
    一所学校的德育工作是否有了相对独立的地位，应具备以下几个条件。
    1、学校各级领导和广大教师要树立正确的教育思想。明确学校是以“育人”为中心，以培养德智体全面发展、适应“三个面向”需要的人才为目标。德育是“育人”和实现培养目标的重要环节，起主导和方向作用，须臾不可离开。校、系领导应把德育工作放在重要议事日程上，每学期要认真研究几次，有计划、有布置、有检查。
    2、建立德育的领导体制和教学机构。学校德育是个大概念，包括政治理论课教育、思想品德课教育及日常思想政治教育。所有这些教育要紧密结合当前形势，结合培养目标，结合学生的思想实际，无论从内容上、方法上都有较大的灵活性，较强的针对性，比其它业务课教学要求高、难度大。因此不能停留在一般号召上，必须有专门的机构领导这项工作，并成立各种德育教研室。如，可建立党政共管的学生思想教育领导小组，下设专门职能部门（学生工作部、学生处），成立政治理论课教研室、思想品德教研室、形势任务教研室、时事政策教研室、青年心理教研室、职业道德教研室等。所有德育教师都要落实到一至两个教研室。
    3、建立一支专门的德育教师队伍。凡专门从事学生思想政治教育和日常思想品德教育的教师和干部，都是德育教师，应取消学生政工干部和政治辅导员的名称，全部改为德育教师，和其他教师享受同等的待遇。德育教师有四个职能：①担任学生辅导员或班主任，负责一个年级或班级的学生日常思想教育工作；②教学工作，通过开设德育方面的必修课或选修课、讲座，向学生进行思想政治教育、理论教育，完成本教研室交给的教学任务；③研究工作，主要研究青年学生的特点及思想教育工作的内容、方法、规律，每年要有一定的研究成果；④咨询工作，学校可开展学生思想心理咨询服务“门诊”，回答学生关于恋爱、人际关系、品德情操、心理卫生、思想政治等方面的问题，德育教师应是某一方面、几方面的“门诊”专家，帮助学生解决疑难问题。
    4、建立德育的体系和网络。学校德育应贯穿到学生进校后的全过程，要根据不同年级学生的特点，制定不同的德育教学计划，除政治理论课已有计划外，其它方面也要作科学安排。如，对一年级学生可着重进行法制教育、思想品德规范教育、人生观教育；对二、三年级学生着重进行爱国主义和革命传统教育、恋爱观教育；对高年级学生着重进行职业道德教育等。另外，还要对不同层次的学生制定不同的教育内容和方法，如对学生中的党员、要求入党的积极分子，应有较高的要求，较深的内容，努力把他们培养成青年马克思主义者和共产主义战士。对那些平时纪律松弛、要求不严、学习上得过且过的学生，品德修养较差的学生，应另行制定德育计划，注意对他们加强基础文明教育。学校德育也要编写教学大纲和教材，有目的、有计划、有要求，把教师讲授与学生自学、讨论结合起来，但德育的教学工作应以针对性、实践性为主，不能局限于教材，更不能上成纯理论的课程。
    5、建立德育考核制度。学校德育工作开展得如何，效果如何，应进行必要的考核。对学生的考核包括两方面，一是德育理论知识的考核，如政治理论课、思想品德课、法制课等考核；一是思想品德行为考核，如政治态度、学习态度、组织纪律、集体观点、品德修养、团结同学、勤俭节约、劳动卫生等。不同类型的学校，不同的年级，可确立不同的考核指标体系，德育考核每学期或每学年一次，与学生素质综合测评同时进行，考核的结果记入成绩册，并与评定奖学金、评三好学生以及毕业生择优分配，直接挂钩。只有实行德育考核，才能巩固德育的地位，避免造成可听可不听、可做可不做的状况，从而维护了德育的权威，增强了德育的效果。另外，对学校及德育教师也要进行考核，即德育评估，考查德育工作落实的情况，促进德育工作的开展。
