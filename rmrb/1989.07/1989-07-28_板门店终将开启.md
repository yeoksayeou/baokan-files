	The Panmunjom Gate Will Eventually Open
	Xinhua News Agency reporters: Zhu Kechuan, Zhang Jinfang

	On July 27, Lin Xiucui, a representative of the National University Student Representatives Council of South Korea, came to the truce village of Panmunjom, attempting to cross the military demarcation line from there to return to Seoul, which is only 70 kilometers away. However, the Panmunjom Gate, just a line away, mercilessly blocked the steps of this Korean daughter, preventing her from achieving her wish.

	Lin Xiucui recently, as a representative of the million young students of South Korea, broke through the numerous obstacles of the South Korean authorities, and arrived in the North after a long journey, participating in the World Youth Festival held in Pyongyang. Subsequently, she joined more than 400 people from over 30 countries in a march for peace and unification of the Korean Peninsula. Starting from the foothills of Mount Baekdu, they were heading south to Panmunjom and then to Hannam Mountain in Jeju Island, South Korea.

	During the march, the 21-year-old Lin Xiucui deeply felt the pain of her country's division. She shouted with her fellow northerners the common cry that had been suppressed in her heart: "Long live the unification of the motherland!" She said that she came to North Korea and hoped to return to Seoul via Panmunjom, just to promote the unification of the North and the South.

	Today, the security in the Joint Security Area is particularly tight, with American and North Korean soldiers standing face to face. At 5 PM, Lin Xiucui and her entourage left the northern side of the Panmunjom Gate and walked towards the southern side of the Joint Security Area. After taking a few steps, Lin Xiucui stopped at the steps in front of the gate. Due to the ban by the South Korean authorities and the American side of the Military Armistice Commission, Lin Xiucui could not proceed any further.

	July 27 is the anniversary of the Korean Armistice. Thirty-six years ago today, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in Panmunjom, and since then, a military demarcation line has replaced the 38th parallel, dividing the beautiful mountains and rivers of Korea. Today, the Panmunjom Gate, which was once famous for welcoming merchants, stands as an invisible barrier in front of Lin Xiucui.

	The military demarcation line in the Joint Security Area is a cement strip about 5 centimeters high and 10 centimeters wide. If one steps over it, it is South Korean territory. How Lin Xiucui wanted to cross this half-step demarcation line and rush into the arms of her parents in Seoul. Lin Xiucui's face showed a mix of regret and anger, with tears welling up in her eyes. She looked towards the southern sky and, with a passionate tone, said to her northern compatriots and foreign friends: "This is our country, our land. Why can't I pass through Panmunjom to return home?!"

    板门店终将开启
    新华社记者　朱克川　张锦芳
    南朝鲜全国大学生代表协议会代表林秀卿7月27日来到停战村板门店，试图从这里跨过军事分界线返回相距仅70公里的汉城。但是，仅仅一线之隔的板门店无情地挡住了这位朝鲜热血女儿的步伐，使她未能如愿以偿。
    林秀卿不久前作为南朝鲜百万青年学生的代表，冲破南朝鲜当局的重重阻力，辗转到达北方，参加了在平壤举行的世界青年联欢节。随后，她同来自30多个国家的400多名人士一道举行争取朝鲜半岛和平与统一的国际大行军。从白头山麓南下，准备通过板门店一直到达南朝鲜南端济州岛汉拿山。
    在大行军途中，年仅21岁的林秀卿深感祖国分裂的切肤之痛。她同北方同胞一道喊出了压在心底的共同呼声：“祖国统一万岁！”她说，她来到朝鲜北方和希望从板门店回汉城，只是为了促进南北方的统一。
    今天，共同警备区内戒备格外森严，美军和朝鲜人民军士兵相视而立。下午5时，林秀卿一行离开板门店北方一侧的板门，向共同警备区南方一侧走去。刚刚迈出几步，林秀卿便驻足于板门前的台阶上。由于南朝鲜当局和军停会美国方面禁止林秀卿通过板门店，她再也无法往前走去。
    7月27日是朝鲜停战纪念日。36年前的这一天，朝鲜停战协定在板门店签字，从此一条军事分界线取代三八线把朝鲜的大好河山一分为二。今天，历史上曾以开启板门迎接过往商贾闻名的板门店，在林秀卿面前却竖起了无形的板门。
    共同警备区的军事分界线是一条高约5厘米、宽约10厘米的水泥条台，只要一脚迈过去便是南朝鲜的土地。林秀卿多么想越过这条仅有半步的分界线，投入在汉城的父母怀抱。林秀卿脸上呈现半是遗憾半是愤怒的神色，眼中噙着泪花。她仰望南方天际，以奋激的语调对她的北方同胞和外国朋友说：“这是我们的祖国，我们的土地，我为什么不能经过板门店回到家乡？！”（新华社平壤7月27日电）
