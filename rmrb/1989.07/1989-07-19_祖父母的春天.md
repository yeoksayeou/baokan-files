Title: The Spring of Grandparents

Every day after school, in front of the gates of various primary schools in Paris, many elderly people with white hair can often be seen sitting on benches. They chat and laugh, and as soon as the children swarm out of the school grounds, they all stand on tiptoes, eagerly waiting for their grandchildren to rush into their arms.

In the past, grandmothers were affectionately called "gift grandmas." Children longed to see their grandparents, hoping they would bring them the gifts they dreamed of. Now, they have a new title: "Wednesday Mommies." They pick up and drop off their grandchildren every day, and on Wednesdays, when French primary schools are closed, they naturally become the caregivers.

A popular new book in France, "The Spring of Grandparents," points out that from 1962 to 1988, the number of dual-income households in France doubled. Now, for every three working mothers, one entrusts her children to "grandma" (or "grandma on the mother's side") for care—either for lunch or in the evenings or during vacations. Therefore, at least 80% of French seniors over the age of 55 spend holidays with their grandchildren.

It is clear that in future families, the role of (grand)parents will become increasingly important. A retired architect named Raymond, who travels with his wife on weekends, always brings his only granddaughter along. The little girl jumps for joy at these times. "We always have dinner at our daughter's house once a week," Raymond says. "On weekends, they always come back to the maternal home. The children are happy to see us, and we are also happy, eliminating loneliness."

According to a poll by "Student" magazine, among every five 15- to 18-year-old French students, at least four visit their grandparents (grandparents on the mother's side) once or several times a month, and possibly one in four do so every week.

The survey also found that at least 70% of students believe that grandparents play a very important role in their lives.

France's most authoritative child psychologist, Françoise Dolto, believes that grandparents play a meaningful balancing and buffering role in the eyes of children. In the eyes of children, grandparents are much more affectionate. They are like friends with whom one can share little secrets. They won't scold like parents do, nor will they be insensitive; children can call their grandparents by their first names without fear of being scolded. Grandparents are symbols of gentleness and love.

In France, a society where marital relationships are unstable, grandparents have become the "lifebuoys" for their grandchildren. A lawyer in Paris who specializes in family cases says, "Now, men and women who come to the office to handle divorces often do so with their fathers or mothers accompanying them, sometimes even with both parents present. This is unprecedented in France." When such family tragedies occur, in addition to being indignant, grandparents are more concerned about the custody of their grandchildren.

"A new generation has been born!" the book "The Spring of Grandparents" proclaims. "They are neither old nor young, but a batch of middle-aged people unlike any before." "Those grandparents who are just turning 50 and holding their grandchildren in their arms were only 30 years old during the 'May Revolution' of 1968 that shook the world. They themselves have made fierce criticisms of outdated values. Unlike the old-fashioned grandparents, their minds are more open, more tolerant, and more flexible in their dealings."

No wonder many people in France use poetic language to declare: The spring of grandparents has arrived in their autumn!

### 祖父母的春天

    祖父母的春天
    每天放学的时间，在巴黎各小学门前的长椅上，常常出现许多白发老人。他们谈天说地，一旦校园中的孩子们蜂涌而出时，便个个踮起脚，眼巴巴盼望着自己的孙儿孙女扑入怀抱。
    往昔，祖母们的美称是“礼物奶奶”。孩子们想见祖父母，巴望他们会送给自己梦想中的礼物。她们现在有了新的头衔：“星期三妈咪”。她们天天接送孙儿孙女上学，在星期三法国小学放假时，她们便成了理所当然的“保姆”。
    法国一本颇受欢迎的新书《祖父母的春天》指出，从1962年至1988年，法国双职工家庭猛增了一倍。现今每三个上班的妈妈中，就有一个把孩子托给“奶奶（姥姥）”照看——要么是中午搭餐，要么在晚上或度假期间全权负责。所以55岁以上的法国老人，至少有80％以上与儿孙们共度假日。
    可见，在未来的家庭中，（外）祖父母的地位越来越显得重要。一个叫雷蒙的退休建筑师周末同老伴远游时，总要带着他们唯一的外孙女，小女孩每到此时前蹦后跳，非常快活。“我们每星期总要在女儿家吃一次饭。”雷蒙说，“周末她们又总是回娘家来。小孩子愿意见到我们，而我们也消除了寂寞，非常快活。”在法国，像雷蒙一家这样亲密的往来是很普遍的。
    根据《学生》杂志的一次民意测验发现，在每5个15到18岁的法国学生中，至少有4个要每月一次或几次去探望爷爷奶奶（外公外婆），可能有1／4的人达到每周一次。
    在测验中还发现，至少有70％的学生认为，爷爷奶奶在他们生活中占了颇为或非常重要的地位。
    法国最具权威的儿童心理学家弗朗斯娃丝·多尔托认为，祖父母在孩子们心目中起着一种有意义的平衡、缓冲作用。在孩子们眼里，爷爷奶奶比父母亲切得多，他们像朋友一样，可以与之倾诉小秘密。他们不会像爸爸妈妈一样只知道板起脸孔教育，丝毫不解人意；孩子们可以像朋友一样直呼爷爷奶奶的名字，而不用忌讳爷爷奶奶对自己发火。爷爷奶奶是温和、慈爱的象征。
    在法国这样一个婚姻关系浮动不安的社会中，祖父母无形中成了儿孙们的“救生圈”。巴黎一个专门接办家庭案件的律师说：“现在前来事务所办理离婚的男女，往往都在他们爸爸或妈妈的陪伴下，有时甚至是双亲都出席。这在法国是前所未有的新鲜事。”碰上这类家庭破裂的悲剧，祖父母们在愤愤然外，更多的是关心孙儿、孙女的抚养权。
    “一个新的世代诞生了！”《祖父母的春天》一书这样宣称。“他们既不年老，也不年轻，是一批不同以往的中年人”。“那些刚满50岁的抱孙子的祖父母们，在1968年震憾乾坤的“五月革命”中，不过30岁。他们本身对陈腐的价值观作过激烈的批判。不同于旧式的阿公阿婆，他们的心灵更开放，更富于容忍精神，处事也更有弹性”。
    无怪乎法国有不少人用赞美诗般的语言宣告：祖父母们秋天里的春天来到了！
