Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th.

The final stage of the Chinelin Cup International Women's Volleyball Tournament began today. The Chinese team defeated the Japanese team with a score of 3-0. The set scores were 15-10, 16-14, and 15-11.

In another match, the Soviet Union team lost to the Cuban team with a score of 2-3. The set scores were 15-4, 4-15, 15-8, 11-15, and 12-15. This was the first match in this tournament to go to five sets.

The four teams that have advanced to the finals will compete in a single round-robin format to determine the champion. Since the results of the preliminary group stage carry over to the final stage, the Chinese team will not face the Cuban team, and the Soviet Union team will not face the Japanese team. Therefore, tomorrow's match between China and the Soviet Union will be crucial for the championship. The Soviet Union team must win 3-0 against China to claim the title; otherwise, they will be ranked third behind Cuba. The Chinese team is the only undefeated team so far. Even if they lose 2-3 to the Soviet Union, they will still secure the championship based on the number of sets won. Local experts believe that the Chinese team has the highest chance of winning the title.

    中国女排获奇尼林杯决赛权
    新华社莫斯科7月25日电  （张志强）据塔斯社报道，奇尼林杯国际女子排球赛决赛阶段的比赛今天开始。中国队以3∶0击败日本队，3局的比分是15∶10，16∶14，15∶11。
    在另一场比赛中，苏联队以2∶3负于古巴队。5局的比分是15∶4，4∶15，15∶8，11∶15，12∶15。这是本届杯赛开始以来首场打满5局的比赛。
    进入这次比赛4强的队伍将通过单循环赛决出冠军。由于小组预赛的成绩带入决赛阶段的比赛，中国队与古巴队、苏联队与日本队均不再对阵。这样，明天的中苏之战就成了冠军争夺战。苏联队只有以3∶0胜中国队才能夺冠，若输掉这场比赛就只能在古巴队之后名列第三。中国队目前是唯一保持不败的队伍，即使以2∶3负于苏联队，按净胜局计算也稳拿冠军。此间人士认为，中国队夺魁希望最大。
