Title: Fines Cannot Buy "Legal Rights" to Pollute

The historic Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which has benefited the region for centuries, is now facing increasingly severe pollution. Officials from the Dujiangyan Management Bureau have reported that some major polluters continue to discharge wastewater year after year, despite being fined annually. The amount of pollution only increases, and there is no sign of the pollution sources being treated. Paying fines has essentially become a way to purchase "legal rights" to pollute. It is understood that a paper mill located upstream, which is severely polluted, is expanding its production from 3,000 tons per year to 15,000 tons per year due to high profits. The production scale is set to increase fivefold, and without special treatment measures, the severity of the pollution can be imagined. If this continues, not only will the 8 million mu of irrigated farmland suffer, but the countless residents of Chengdu who rely on the canal water for their livelihood will also be forced to "drink poison to quench their thirst"!

How to protect the environment, which is essential for human survival, has become a major global concern. In China, it has been listed as a fundamental national policy, and the Environmental Protection Law is about to be promulgated and implemented. However, this issue has not received sufficient attention in some regions. The phenomenon of paying fines while continuing to discharge wastewater and pollutants is not unique to Dujiangyan. This is partly due to the fines being too small to serve as a deterrent, but a more significant reason is that many comrades prioritize immediate benefits while neglecting the severe consequences of environmental pollution. For enterprises that repeatedly violate pollution regulations, other necessary administrative and legal measures should be taken. Furthermore, when evaluating officials, economic performance should not be the only criterion. The effectiveness of environmental protection work should also be a crucial and tangible indicator.

    罚款换不来“合法权”
    官伟勋
    历史悠久，造福一方的都江堰，正遭受着越来越严重的污染之害。都江堰管理处的同志讲，一些排污大户，年年被罚款，年年排污水，只见排污量增加，不见污染源治理。缴纳罚款实际上变成了购买排污“合法权”。据了解，一家地处上游污染严重的造纸厂，因为利润大，正在由年产3000吨扩建为年产15000吨，生产规模相当于原来的5倍，如果不采取特别的治理措施，其污染程度的严重可想而知。长此下去，不仅受渠水灌溉的800万亩良田将倍受其害，就是两岸靠渠水为生的万千天府子弟也只好“饮鸩止渴”了！
    如何保护好人类生存的环境，现在已是举世瞩目的重大课题，在我国，已经把它列为一项基本国策，环境保护法将颁布实施。但是这个问题在一些地区显然还没有得到足够的重视，类似罚款照缴、污水污气照排照放这种现象，绝非都江堰所仅有。这固然与罚款额太小不足惩戒有关，然而相当一部分同志只顾眼前利益，忽视环境污染的严重后果恐怕是更重要的原因。对待屡罚无效的排污企业，还应该采取其他必要的行政法律手段。此外，考察评价干部，绝不能只看经济效益，环境保护工作的好坏，也应该是实打实的硬指标。
