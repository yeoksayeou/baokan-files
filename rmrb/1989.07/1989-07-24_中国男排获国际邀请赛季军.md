The international men's volleyball invitational in Gorzow, Poland concluded today. The Chinese national men's volleyball team, after a tenacious struggle, won the third place.

Six teams from five countries participated in this invitational tournament. After three days of intense competition, the Bulgarian men's team took first place, and the Polish national team took second place.

On the 21st, the Chinese team defeated the Bulgarian team but lost to the East German team. On the 22nd, they defeated the Spanish team 3:1 but lost 0:3 to the Polish team.

In the match against the Spanish team, China initially lost the first set 6:15 but won the second set 15:12. In the third set, China was down 2:10 but managed to equalize at 10:10 after some adjustments. The Chinese team then made several strategic substitutions, and the situation began to change. The players on the court were both active and calm, holding off the opponent's attacks and launching their own. They eventually won the set 15:10. The fourth set ended with a decisive 15:2 victory.

Today's afternoon match against the Polish team was a contest of significant technical and height disparities. The opposing team fully utilized their height advantage at the net, while China seemed to lack effective strategies to counter the taller players. The result was a 0:3 loss, with set scores of 7:15, 9:15, and 4:15.

The Chinese team has already departed for West Germany to participate in another invitational tournament.

    中国男排获国际邀请赛季军
    新华社波兰戈茹夫7月23日电　（记者马云亮）波兰戈茹夫国际男排邀请赛今天在这里闭幕。中国国家男子排球队经过顽强奋战，夺得第三名。
    参加本次邀请赛的共有5个国家的6支排球队。经过3天的激烈争夺，保加利亚男排取得第一名，波兰国家一队取得第二名。
    中国队21日战胜保加利亚队，负于民主德国队。22日以3∶1战胜西班牙队，但以0∶3负于波兰队。
    中国队在同西班牙队比赛中，先以6∶15输掉一局，以15∶12扳回一局。在第三局，中国队曾以2∶10落后，相持一段时间后，中国队调整阵容，换上几名新队员，形势开始发生变化。场上队员既活跃，又冷静，顶住对方的攻势并大胆进攻，扳成10平。接着他们一鼓作气，四号位几记漂亮的斜线扣杀和几次成功的拦网，终以15∶10结束这局。第4局，以15∶2的悬殊比分结束这场战斗。
    今天下午中国队对波兰一队的比赛，是一场技术、身高差距悬殊的比赛。对方充分发挥网上高度优势，我方显得缺乏对付高大队员的有效办法。结果以0∶3失利，三局的比分是7∶15，9∶15，4∶15。
    中国队今天已前往联邦德国参加另一邀请赛。
