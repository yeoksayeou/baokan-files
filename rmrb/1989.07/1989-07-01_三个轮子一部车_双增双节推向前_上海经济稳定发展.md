People's Daily, Beijing, July 1st - Reporter Lǔ Mù learned from the State Planning Commission that Shanghai, with ideological and political work as the front wheel and administrative and economic measures as the rear wheels, is pushing forward with "three wheels, one car." The city is extensively and deeply carrying out the "double increase, double conservation" campaign. In the first five months of this year, the national economy has maintained a stable development trend.

Since the beginning of this year, the city has conducted three relatively concentrated ideological mobilizations among the vast number of cadres and workers. At the beginning of the year, facing the difficulties that arose during the rectification and rectification, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government promptly mobilized cadres at all levels to boost their spirits, take the initiative, and work together to overcome the difficulties. In mid-May, facing difficulties in energy, funds, raw materials, and some college students' hunger strikes and sit-ins, which disrupted social order, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government issued a call for cadres and workers to stay at their posts, launch the "double increase, double conservation" campaign, stabilize the economy, and stabilize Shanghai. In early June, as the situation in Shanghai stabilized, the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government again required all sectors to strengthen ideological and political work through discussing the situation and tasks, and guide the political enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, which was aroused in stabilizing Shanghai and the overall situation, to production and construction, make up for the losses, develop production, and ensure supply.

The city has set clear targets for the "double increase, double conservation" campaign. Administrative and economic measures are used to adjust the industrial structure and product structure. To this end, the production of 220 types of products, including daily necessities for people's lives and medium-to-high-end durable consumer goods that stabilize the financial situation by circulating currency, is given priority. The production of 100 types of products is restricted and eliminated, and a number of enterprises are closed and transformed. Monitoring systems are also implemented for 51 types of commodities (including 34 types of industrial products).

At the same time, the integration of industry and commerce is strengthened, and the reform of the foreign trade system is deepened. The "dual-line contracting" system, also known as the foreign trade agency system, is first implemented in the textile industry. This means that industrial enterprises contract for export foreign exchange earnings targets, and foreign trade enterprises contract for export agency targets, jointly completing the export foreign exchange earnings tasks.

Through the joint efforts of all parties, although agricultural production in the city has encountered a once-in-a-century heavy rain, except for a slight decrease in summer grain and rapeseed production, other types of agricultural and sideline products have increased significantly. In the first five months of this year, industrial production has steadily increased, with a total output value growth of 7.6% compared to the same period last year. The market is relatively stable, and the price index has started to fall. Savings deposits have increased by 19%, and currency circulation has increased by 46.9% compared to the same period last year. The utilization of foreign capital and direct foreign investment have increased by 2.8 times and 67.6% respectively compared to the same period last year. The city's fiscal revenue has increased by 5% compared to the same period last year.

    三个轮子一部车  双增双节推向前
    上海经济稳定发展
    本报北京7月1日讯　记者鲁牧从国家计委获悉：上海以思想政治工作为前轮导向，行政手段、经济手段为后轮齐转，“三个轮子一部车”，广泛深入开展增产节约、增收节支，今年头5个月，国民经济保持稳定发展的势头。
    今年以来，全市在广大干部和职工中进行了3次比较集中的思想发动。年初，面对治理、整顿中出现的困难，市委、市政府及时动员各级干部振奋精神，积极进取，共渡难关。5月中旬，面临能源、资金、原材料困难和部分大学生绝食静坐、社会正常秩序遭受破坏，市委、市政府发出号召，要求广大干部职工坚守岗位，开展双增双节运动，稳定经济，稳定上海。6月上旬，上海局势趋于稳定，市委、市政府又要求各行各业通过讲形势、讲任务，加强思想政治工作，将广大职工在稳定上海、稳定大局中激发出来的政治热情引导到生产建设上来，夺回损失，发展生产，保障供给。
    全市制定了明确的双增双节目标。运用行政手段和经济手段，调整产业结构、产品结构。为此，优先发展人民生活必需的日用工业品、回笼货币稳定金融的中高档耐用消费品等220种产品的生产，限制、淘汰100种产品，并关停并转一批企业。还对51种商品（其中工业品34种）实行了监控制度。
    与此同时，加强工贸结合，深化外贸体制改革。并确定先在纺织行业全面推行外贸代理制，又称“双线承包”，即工业企业承包出口创汇指标，外贸企业承包出口代理指标，共同完成出口创汇任务。
    经过上下左右共同努力，全市农业生产虽遇百年未有的暴雨，但除夏粮油菜有所减产外，其他各类农副产品均有较大幅度增长。今年头5个月，工业生产稳步上升，总产值比去年同期增长7.6％。市场比较稳定，物价指数开始回落。储蓄存款上升19％，货币回笼比去年同期增长46.9％。利用外资和外商直接投资分别比去年同期增长2.8倍和67.6％。全市财政收入比去年同期增长5％。
