    Chengdu People's Department Store Destroyed by Arsonists; Insurance Company Implements "Flexible Compensation"

    Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 30 (Reporter Ling Yun) The Chengdu Municipal Insurance Company has decided to implement "flexible compensation" for Chengdu People's Department Store, which was burned down by a gang of arsonists on June 5, as well as for the affected residential buildings. Recently, the municipal insurance company has prepaid 2.5 million yuan for the department store's self-rescue production.

    According to the insurance regulations, insurance companies are not responsible for compensating for property losses caused by violent acts. However, Hong Wenlong, the general manager of the municipal insurance company, believes that the store being burned down is a serious disaster caused by the turmoil, which is a special case. The insurance company has formally accepted the compensation claim from People's Department Store. The insurance company dispatched over 30 people to investigate the store's losses. In addition to the prepaid compensation, the remaining compensation will be paid after the losses are verified.

    成都人民商场被歹徒烧毁  保险公司实行“通融赔偿”
    新华社成都6月30日电（记者凌云）成都市保险公司决定对在6月5日被一伙歹徒纵火烧毁的成都人民商场及波及受灾的居民住宅实行“通融赔偿”，日前市保险公司已预付250万元用于商场生产自救。
    按保险条例规定，暴力行为造成的保险财产损失，保险公司不负赔偿责任。但市保险公司总经理洪文隆认为，商场被烧是在骚乱中造成的严重灾情，属特殊情况，正式受理人民商场的赔款要求。保险公司派出30多人调查商场损失情况，除已预付赔款外，其余赔款在查清后付清。
