North Korea demands resumption of sports talks with South Korea.

The North Korean sports delegation participating in the North-South sports talks issued a statement in Pyongyang today, demanding the resumption of sports talks with the South Korean delegation to form a unified North-South sports team to participate in the Beijing Asian Games.

Since March 9 this year, the North and South Korean sports delegations have held two rounds of talks on the issue of forming a unified team to participate in the 11th Asian Games. According to the North's proposal, the third round of talks was originally scheduled for July 18. On July 15, the South Korean side notified the North that due to recent visits by some South Korean individuals to the North without authorization, causing "internal chaos" in the South, the third round of North-South sports talks had to be postponed indefinitely.

The statement from the North Korean sports delegation said that South Korea's indefinite postponement of the North-South sports talks without valid reasons violates the common wish of the North and South Korean people to form a unified team to participate in the Beijing Asian Games.

The statement suggested that the third round of North-South sports talks be held on August 10 at the "House of Peace" on the South side of Panmunjom.

    朝鲜北方要求同南朝鲜恢复体育会谈
    新华社平壤7月23日电　据朝鲜中央通讯社报道，参加朝鲜北南体育会谈的北方体育代表团今天在平壤发表声明，要求同南朝鲜代表团恢复体育会谈，以便组成统一的北南方体育代表队参加北京亚运会。
    自今年3月9日以来，朝鲜北南方体育代表团就组成统一队参加第十一届亚运会问题举行了两次会谈。根据北方的建议，第三次会谈原定于7月18日举行。7月15日，南朝鲜方面通知北方，由于近来一些南方人士未经批准访问北方而造成了南方的“内部混乱”，不得不推迟第三次北南体育会谈。
    北方体育代表团的声明说，南朝鲜在没有正当理由的情况下无限期推迟北南体育会谈，违背了北方和南方人民要求组成统一队参加北京亚运会的共同愿望。
    声明建议，第三次北南体育会谈于8月10日在板门店南方一侧的“和平之家”举行。
