    Building Spiritual Civilization: Taiyuan Promotes Volunteer Labor
    Taiyuan, July 1 (Xinhua) -- Establishing a system of volunteer labor has attracted increasing attention from the citizens of Taiyuan.

    On June 26, 1200 Party members and cadres from the Taiyuan municipal government participated in a volunteer labor activity focused on beautifying the environment. Some citizens were surprised to learn that the group, working under the scorching sun to pull weeds, clean fruit bins, and clean the tombstones of martyrs, included municipal Party Secretary Sun Ying, Mayor Wan Liangshi, and other leaders. "Hey! Even the officials are working!" they exclaimed. A week earlier, Mayor Wan Liangshi had joined hundreds of college students in a volunteer labor activity, marking the beginning of this "volunteer labor" initiative, which had a significant impact on the citizens.

    A relevant official explained that they had long hoped to enhance people's sense of public morality through a practical and acceptable method, while also incorporating patriotism, hard work, and improving relations between the Party and the people, as well as between cadres and the masses. He said, "We chose the form of volunteer labor and hope it can become an institution."

    Seventy years ago, Moscow workers initiated the famous "Saturday Volunteer Labor" activity. Lenin highly praised this activity as "a great innovation" and "a matter of great importance and principle," and often participated in it informally as a citizen. In China, many people remember the story of Lenin carrying wood during volunteer labor, which was recorded in elementary school textbooks at the time.

    建设精神文明的新尝试
    太原兴起义务劳动之风
    本报太原7月1日电　记者阎晓明报道：建立一种义务劳动制度已引起越来越多的太原市民的关注。
    6月26日，太原市直机关1200名党员和干部进行了一次以美化环境为内容的义务劳动。一些市民获悉在烈日下拔草、清洗果皮箱和烈士墓碑的人群中，有市委书记孙英、市长万良适和其他领导时，惊诧地说：“嘿！当官儿的也劳动了！”一周前，太原市长万良适曾与数百名高校学生一起参加了一次义务劳动，那次劳动成为这项“义务劳动”活动的开始，在市民中引起了很大反响。
    有关负责人介绍说，他们一直希望通过一种比较实际，人们能够接受的方式来增强人们的公德意识，同时也能包含爱国主义和艰苦奋斗，以及密切党群、干群关系的内容。他说，“我们选择了义务劳动的形式，并希望能成为一种制度。”
    70年前，莫斯科工人曾发起过著名的“星期六义务劳动”活动。列宁高度评价这一活动是“一个伟大的创举”，“一件极重要的有原则意义的事情”，并多次不拘形式地以一个公民身份参加了这一活动。在中国，许许多多的人都记得列宁在义务劳动中扛木头的故事，关于那件事的记述被收入当时的小学课本中。
