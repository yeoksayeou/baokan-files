    Xu Shoude, the director of the First Printing Factory in Xi'an, proactively accepts supervision from the Party organization and the masses. He insists on regular dialogues and heart-to-heart talks with the workers, striving to do a good job in ideological and political work. During the days of social unrest, all the workers in the factory abided by the law and maintained their posts, not missing a single day of work. In the second quarter of this year, the factory's output and profits reached historical highs. The photo shows Director Xu Shoude (left) and the factory's Party Committee Secretary, Huo Ju (center), visiting the workshop to have a heart-to-heart talk with the workers.
