The late Hungarian doctor András Pető created a "conductive education" method to guide children with cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and other brain disorders to reduce pain and improve their living capabilities. In 1945, he established a school in Budapest.

Initially, the school had only 13 children with brain disabilities. Due to its remarkable therapeutic achievements, there are now 4,500 children on the waiting list to enroll, including 400 from other European countries.

Pető's treatment method primarily involves guiding children with brain disabilities to help themselves, gradually activating their brain functions. The students build confidence and adapt to their surroundings through labor-intensive physical exercises.

The number of children with brain disabilities applying for admission is increasing, and the current challenge is the shortage of experienced teachers.

In 1986, the University of Birmingham in the UK also established a similar school, where six instructors from Hungary's Pető Conductive Education School were sent to train 11 British teachers.

Hungary established the International Pető Institute in March of this year, aiming to train foreign teachers to use the conductive education method to help more children with brain disabilities.

    匈牙利治疗脑残疾儿童有方
    已故匈牙利医生安德拉斯·庇托创造了一套“传导性教育法”，指导患有大脑性麻痹、脊柱裂等脑疾病儿童减轻痛苦和提高生活能力。1945年他在布达佩斯建立了一所学校。
    起初，该校只有13名脑残疾儿童，由于它的理疗成绩显著，现在登记等候入学的脑残儿童已有4500名，其中400名来自欧洲其他国家。
    庇托的治疗方法主要是指导脑残儿童尽力自助，使他们的脑功能逐渐发挥作用。学童们通过做工性的体育锻炼而增强信心，适应周围的环境。
    要求入学的脑残儿童越来越多，眼下的难题是缺乏有经验的教员。
    英国伯明翰大学也于1986年设立了一所类似的学校，由匈牙利的庇托传导教育学校派6名指导员去培训11名英国教员。
    匈牙利已在今年3月成立了国际庇托研究所，准备培训外国教员，以传导教育法拯救更多的脑残儿童。
