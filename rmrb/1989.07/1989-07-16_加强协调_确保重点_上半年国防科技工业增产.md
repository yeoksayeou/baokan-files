Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 16th — The defense science and technology industry has successfully completed the state's key model research and production plans for the first half of the year. Civilian product value has seen a significant increase, and the total industrial output value has grown by 6.4% compared to the same period last year.

During April and May of this year, some regions in China experienced unrest or counter-revolutionary riots. Despite these disruptions, the broad cadres and workers in the defense science and technology industry remained steadfast in their positions, striving to complete the research and production plans for key national defense research projects, new weaponry, urgent combat equipment, and satellite launch projects. By the end of June, the nuclear, aviation, aerospace, and ordnance industries had completed 52.2% of the annual military product production tasks and 48% of the civilian product production tasks. The product structure of military-industrial enterprises has undergone significant changes, moving towards a model of military-civilian integration.

This year, the defense science and technology industry has faced severe challenges in terms of funding, energy, raw materials, and transportation. Despite these difficulties, various departments have strengthened coordination, prioritizing enterprises that undertake key tasks and have good economic benefits. They have also launched extensive efforts to tap into potential, reduce consumption, and increase production. As a result, the civilian product value for the first half of the year has increased by 27.5% compared to the same period last year, accounting for 66.6% of the total output value of the defense science and technology industry.

Experts have analyzed that although the defense science and technology industry has developed steadily in the first half of the year, due to rising costs and the accumulation of some civilian products, the total profit has slightly decreased.

    加强协调　确保重点
    上半年国防科技工业增产
    据新华社北京7月16日电  （记者许志敏）国防科技工业今年上半年较好地完成了国家重点型号研制生产计划，民品产值大幅度增长，工业总产值比去年同期增长6.4％。
    今年4、5月间，我国一些地区发生动乱或反革命暴乱。国防科技工业战线广大干部、职工排除干扰，坚守工作岗位，努力完成国防科研重点项目、新型武器装备的重点型号、作战急需装备以及卫星发射工程等的研制和生产计划。截至6月底，核、航空、航天、兵器行业已完成全年军品生产任务的52.2％，民品生产任务的48％。军工企事业的产品结构有较大变化，正向着军民结合型发展。
    今年国防科技工业在资金、能源、原材料、运输十分紧张的困难条件下，加强各部门的协调，优先保证承担重点任务和经济效益好的企业，并大力开展挖潜、降耗、增产等活动，上半年民品产值比去年同期增长27.5％，已占国防科技工业总产值的66.6％。
    有关专家分析认为，尽管国防科技工业上半年发展平稳，但由于成本升高，部分民品积压，盈利总额仍略有下降。
