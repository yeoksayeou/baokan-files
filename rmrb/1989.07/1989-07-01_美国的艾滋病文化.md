The AIDS culture in the United States originated in 1981, the very year AIDS was first diagnosed. Since then, American culture, like the American people, has been impacted by AIDS, exhibiting a complex mix of fear, anger, sadness, contempt, and bewilderment.

The true flourishing of AIDS culture occurred in the late 1980s. Artistic expressions encompassed all forms: plays, television dramas, films, photography, oil paintings, watercolors, posters, and more. It is hard to imagine any artistic form that has not been influenced by AIDS.

Last year at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and this year at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the photographic works of Mr. Nixon were exhibited. These works depicted the final months of AIDS patients' lives, their gradual deterioration, and their eventual death. The artist's intention was to evoke sympathy and stir indignation against the disease that torments and ravages humanity.

In the play "The Phantom of the Opera" and the television drama "Early Frost," AIDS is portrayed as a disease primarily spreading among promiscuous individuals, thereby reinforcing the impression that AIDS is a "pink plague."

Hollywood seems to have also been affected by AIDS, beginning to produce films about the dire consequences of AIDS and promiscuous sexual behavior.

Activists in the AIDS culture have also devoted part of their efforts to reforming and developing AIDS-related language, aiming to imbue it with spiritual comfort and moral education that provokes deep thought. They have attempted to promote vocabulary that is both accurate in meaning and sympathetic to AIDS patients.

AIDS culture not only includes works that describe AIDS but also those related to the disease. For example, films or plays that caution against promiscuous behavior are also considered part of AIDS culture. The goal is to ultimately eradicate this plague that threatens humanity.

    美国的艾滋病文化
    美国的艾滋病文化源于1981年，正是艾滋病被首次确诊的那一年。从此，美国文化和美国人民一样遭受到艾滋病的冲击，同样表现出恐惧、愤怒、悲哀、轻蔑和迷惘复杂心情。
    艾滋病文化的真正繁荣是在80年代后期，艺术形式无所不包：话剧、电视剧、电影、摄影、油画、水彩画、招贴画等等。人们很难想象出还有哪一种艺术形式尚未受到艾滋病的影响。
    去年在纽约的现代艺术博物馆，今年在波士顿的美术博物馆都展出了尼克森先生的摄影作品。这些作品显示了艾滋病患者最后几个月的生活情况，他们病情逐渐恶化的过程以及最终的死亡。作者的用意是引起人们的同情，激起人们对折磨摧残人类的艾滋病的义愤。
    在话剧《海市蜃楼》和电视剧《早霜》中，艾滋病被描写为主要是在行为放荡者中间流行的疾病，因此就加深了人们的这种印象：艾滋病是“桃色瘟疫”。
    好莱坞最近似乎也受到艾滋病的影响，开始拍摄有关艾滋病和性行为放荡的可怕后果的影片。
    艾滋病文化的积极分子还把一部分精力花在如何改造和发展艾滋病语言方面，以便使之带有精神安慰、道德教育的发人深省的功能。他们已经尝试推广一些既含义准确又能对艾滋病患者寄予同情的词汇。
    艾滋病文化不仅包括描写艾滋病的作品，也包括与这种病有关联的作品。例如，告诫人们检点性生活的电影或戏剧之类也算作艾滋病文化。其宗旨是为最终消灭威胁人类的这种瘟疫。
