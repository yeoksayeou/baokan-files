Xinhua News Agency, June 5th.

The month of May in Wuhan's three towns is bright and sunny. In this season of pleasant weather, 353 outstanding disabled vocational athletes from all over the country gathered here to participate in the first National Vocational Skills Competition for the Disabled.

On the competition field and in conversations, the reporter deeply felt the disabled people's awe-inspiring tenacity for life! They wrote, with blood and sweat a hundred times or a thousand times more than that of the able-bodied, a moving and heart-wrenching song of struggle.

Participation is half the success

"The banner at the entrance of the competition venue reflects the contestants' mindset: "Equal participation in social life, fully demonstrating vocational skills."

Liu Renhuai, a young man with limb disabilities from the Xinjiang delegation, is an assistant engineer at the state-owned Tian Shan Garment Factory. He is newly married, and participating in the competition is an important part of his honeymoon. He said, "Although the results of this competition are not ideal, participation is half the success." Liu, who had won the second place in the Xinjiang sewing group in the selection competition, designed a set of cutting patterns for clothes that participated in the 1989 National Clothing Spring and Summer Fashion Trends Exhibition. Among them, four new styles received encouragement awards.

Wu Hongze, who uses crutches, is a technician at Wuhan Water Transport Engineering College. He did not lose heart when he did not make it into the top three in the radio competition. The 35-year-old Wu Hongze had won a bronze medal in this event at the Second World Vocational Skills Competition for the Disabled in 1985. When evaluating this competition, he said, "This competition is large in scale and high in level. I think the ranking is secondary, the important thing is to fully demonstrate the spirit of the disabled people's striving forward, and participation itself is a great victory!"

We also own this world

Xu Jianguang, a 32-year-old member of the Liaoning team, sits in front of a computer at the venue. It is hard to tell that he is a person with limb disabilities. As his hands move quickly and the keys make a "beep beep" sound, the screen flashes a series of characters. He was the first to complete the task of establishing an office automation database within the specified time, winning the gold medal for this event. After the competition, he told me about his arduous journey. In 1978 and 1979, he passed the college entrance examination with excellent results but was rejected because of his disability.

Disappointment did not make him despair. He said that life taught him that only by persevering in struggle can one survive. He got up from the disappointment and decided to blaze his own trail in the mountains of self-study. Through cold winters and hot summers, by the third year, he held back tears and received a graduation certificate from the Radio and Television University's electronics major. In 1984, he was recruited by the Shenyang Municipal Personnel Bureau as a computer technician at the Blower Factory, and was promoted to assistant engineer at the beginning of last year.

Xu Jianguang, recalling his tortuous experience, said, "Where there is a will, there is a way. The world is created by us ourselves!"

Zhong Shengli, who won the second place in television repair, works at Beijing Dongfeng Television Factory. This 42-year-old disabled athlete is full of energy and has a sharp tongue. "Whoever doesn't believe it, I suggest that next time the competition also allows able-bodied athletes to participate, that's true equality!" There is a reason behind his words. In 1985, when he returned with a silver medal in the television repair event at the Second World Disabled Vocational Skills Competition in Colombia, some people in the factory gossiped, "It's nothing special, a tall person among dwarfs." He didn't say a word. Last year, he resolutely participated in the national "Kunlun Cup" television repair competition organized by the National Electronics Association, and won the first place in both the Beijing preliminary and the national competition! He proved his words with actions: "Disabled people are disabled in body but not in spirit. We do not seek special privileges, but we seek equality. As long as we have the spirit, we do not yield to adversity, and we also own this world!"

The wish of Taiwanese disabled people

During the competition, I met the leader of the Taiwan delegation, Zhai Pingyang. When we met, he hugged me with both arms—he has no hands! He also speaks fluent Mandarin, and we hit it off immediately. Mr. Zhai is the "Self-Strengthening Entrepreneurial Model" in Taipei and the publisher of the magazine "Disabled People" in Taiwan. He told me that in Taiwan, disabled people are called "disabled but not disabled, obstacles but not obstacles." They advocate self-help and mutual assistance, self-reliance, and self-improvement. Mr. Zhai excitedly said:

"Last year, when the China Disabled Persons' Rehabilitation Center was established, I went to Beijing to attend the inauguration ceremony. I am proud and moved that China has the largest disabled persons' rehabilitation center in Asia! This time, the China Disabled Persons' Federation invited us five people to observe, and we came with 12 people. It is the first time to form a team to participate in such an activity, and we are very excited. Please convey our wish: we hope that next time our athletes can compete with the mainland athletes. We strive to win glory for the Chinese people in the third World Disabled Vocational Skills Competition!"

The call of the disabled cause

Call for legislation. The development of the disabled cause needs legal guarantees. The Constitution of our country and the "Five-Year Work Program for the Disabled Cause" approved by the State Council last year have made principled provisions for the development of the disabled cause and the rights and obligations of disabled people. But how to implement and reflect them? For this reason, the disabled cause calls for the early promulgation of laws and regulations such as the "Disabled Persons' Social Security Law," "Disabled Persons' Education Regulations," and "Design Standards for Convenient City Roads and Public Buildings for the Disabled."

Call for publicity. To arouse the concern of the whole society for the disabled cause, publicity is indispensable. In this regard, the media should give strong support. A responsible person from the Fujian Provincial Disabled Persons' Federation said they planned to do a special program on a provincial television station, but it was canceled because the other party quoted a price of 10,000 yuan. They also planned to hold a "call for papers" through several newspapers, but it was canceled due to lack of funds. The responsible person of the Beijing Disabled Persons' Federation expressed the same sigh: the publicity of the disabled cause is really difficult!

Call for society. Statistical data show that there are 51.64 million disabled people in our country, and on

### 深情的呼唤　意志的拚搏——首届残疾人职业技能竞赛侧记

    深情的呼唤　意志的拚搏
    ——首届残疾人职业技能竞赛侧记
    新华社记者　方政军　本报记者　徐运平
    五月的武汉三镇，春光明媚。在这风和日丽的季节，全国各地353名残疾人优秀职业选手汇集这里，参加全国首届残疾人职业技能竞赛。
    赛场上，交谈中，记者深深地感受到残疾人那震撼心灵的顽强生命力！他们用超乎健全人百倍千倍的血汗，谱写出一首首奋力拚搏、催人泪下的歌。
    参与就是成功的一半
    “平等参与社会生活，充分显示职业技能”。赛场门口的横幅反映了选手们的参赛心理。
    新疆代表队的肢残青年刘仁怀是国营天山服装厂的助理工程师，新婚燕尔，参加比赛是他蜜月中的重要项目。他说：“虽然这次比赛成绩不太理想，但参与就是成功的一半。”小刘在选拔赛中曾获新疆缝纫组第2名。他今年设计的裁剪样板服装已参加1989年全国服装春夏流行趋势展览，其中4种新款式获得鼓励奖。
    拄着双拐的吴宏泽是武汉水运工程学院技师，他从收音机赛场下来并不因未能进入前三名而灰心。35岁的吴宏泽曾于1985年获第二届世界残疾人职业技能比赛这个项目的铜牌。他在评价这次比赛时说：“这次比赛规模大、水平高。我想名次是次要的，重要的是充分显示了残疾人奋发向上的精神风貌，参与本身就是了不起的胜利！”
    我们同样拥有这个世界
    辽宁队32岁的徐建光坐在赛场的计算机前，很难看出他是一位肢残人。随着他飞快的手式和按键的“嘟嘟”声，屏幕上闪电般显示出一串串字符。在规定时间内他第一个完成了建立办公室自动化数据库的试题，获得这个项目的金牌。赛后他对我谈起了他的艰辛历程。1978年和1979年他两次以优异成绩通过高考，却因为残疾而被刷了下来。
    失望并没有使他绝望。他说，生活告诉我，唯有矢志不渝地奋斗才能生存。从失望中爬起来，他决心在自学的崇山峻岭中辟出一条属于自己的路。寒来暑往，到第三个年头他含泪捧到了电大电子专业毕业证书。1984年被沈阳市人事局招聘为鼓风机厂计算机技术员，去年初被晋升为助理工程师。
    徐建光在回顾自己的曲折经历后说：“有志者事竟成，世界靠我们自己去创造！”
    获得电视机修理第2名的北京东风电视机厂的钟胜利与徐建光有着相似的生活道路。这位42岁的肢残选手精力充沛、谈锋颇健。“谁不服气，我建议下次比赛也让健全人选手参加，这才是真正的平等竞争。”话出有因。那是1985年他在哥伦比亚第二届伤残人职业技能比赛上获得电视机修理项目银牌载誉归来时，厂里有人风言风语：“没什么了不起，矮子中的高子。”他没吭声。去年他毅然参加了由全国电子协会举办的全国“昆仑杯”电视机修理比赛，一口气拿下北京预赛第一，全国第一！他以行动证明了他的话：“残疾人身残志不残。我们不求特权，但求平等。只要有志气，不屈服于逆境，我们同样拥有这个世界！”
    台湾残疾人的心愿
    在竞赛期间的残疾人联欢会上我认识了台湾代表队领队翟平洋。见面时他用双臂用力把我拥住——他没有双手！他也讲一口流利的普通话，我们一见如故。翟先生是台北“自强创业楷模，”台湾《残障人》杂志的发行人。他告诉我，台湾叫残障人，残而不废、障而无碍。提倡残疾人自助助人，自强自立。翟先生激动地说：
  “去年中国残疾人康复中心成立时我去北京参加了成立仪式。我为中国拥有亚洲最大的残疾人康复中心而自豪和感动！这次中残联邀请我们5人来观摩，我们一下来了12人。第一次组团参加这样的活动，十分兴奋。请转告我们的心愿：希望下次我们的选手能与大陆选手一道比赛。争取在第三届世界伤残人职业技能竞赛中携手为中国人争光！”
    残疾事业的呼唤
    呼唤立法。残疾事业的发展需要法律保障。我国宪法和去年国务院批准实施的《残疾人事业五年工作纲要》对残疾人事业的发展以及残疾人的权利、义务等作出了原则性规定。但如何落实、体现？为此，残疾事业呼唤《残疾人社会保障法》、《残疾人教育条例》以及《方便残疾人的城市道路和公共建筑设计规范》等法规的早日出台。
    呼唤宣传。要唤起全社会对残疾事业的关心，离不开宣传。在这方面，新闻媒介应给予大力支持。福建省残联负责同志说他们准备在一家省级电视台搞一个专题，因对方要价一万而告吹，想通过几家报刊搞一次“征文”，也因资金不足而告吹。北京残联的负责人发出同样的感叹：残疾事业的宣传真难！
    呼唤社会。统计数据表明：我国有5164万残疾人，平均每五户中有一户就有残疾人。这些残疾人的教育、就业、康复以及生活直接关系到社会的安定与发展。残疾人本身应奋发、拚搏，同时更需要一个温暖的生存空间和自强自立的广阔天地。只要社会伸出温暖之手，残疾人队伍中将会涌现出更多的强者！
