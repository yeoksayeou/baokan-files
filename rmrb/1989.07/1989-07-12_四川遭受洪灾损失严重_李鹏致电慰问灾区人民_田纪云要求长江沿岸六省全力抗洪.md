Our reporter, Lu Mao Cheng and Chen Hua, reported from Chengdu on July 12th:

In recent days, Sichuan Province has experienced continuous heavy rain, with 86 counties affected by floods. As of today, 367 people have died in the flood disaster, and the economic losses are severe.

In this flood disaster, the areas most severely affected are Nanchong, Dazhou, Wanxian, Fuling, and Chongqing. Heavy rain caused floods, rivers to rise rapidly, landslides, and mudslides in many places. Houses collapsed, large areas of farmland were flooded and washed away, transportation and communication were disrupted, and there were heavy casualties among people and livestock. This has caused huge losses to industry, agriculture, and the lives and property of the people. It is understood that 221 people in Xikou Town, Huaying City, were buried by a landslide. In addition, more than 320 people died in Chongqing and Nanchong. Cities such as Linwu, Dianjiang, Hechuan, and Jiangbei were flooded, with thousands of people surrounded by floodwaters, and millions of acres of crops flooded and washed away. The Xiangyu Railway suffered multiple landslides and was forced to suspend operations.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 11th.

Vice Premier and Commander-in-Chief of the National Flood Control Headquarters, Tian Jiyun, sent a message to the governors and flood control headquarters of Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces, requiring the relevant regions to take the matter seriously, implement the responsibility system, clarify the division of labor, and assign responsibilities to individuals. Immediately organize flood control teams to go to the front line of flood control and do their best to fight against the floods. For dangerous projects and weak links, it is necessary to guard them with heavy troops to ensure absolute safety.
