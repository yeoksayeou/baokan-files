Greece will form an interim government. Elections will be held again after three months.

Xinhua News Agency, Athens, July 1st: Greek conservative New Democracy Party member Tzannetakis (formerly translated as Tzannetakis) was authorized today to form an interim government and received the support of the Left and Progressive Alliance.

Greece held elections on June 18th, but no single party secured an absolute majority to form a government. Tzannetakis was authorized to form the interim government after the three parties that received the most votes—the New Democracy Party, the Panhellenic Socialist Movement, and the Left and Progressive Alliance—all failed to form a government.

Tzannetakis said in a speech tonight that the sole purpose of the interim government is to clarify the country's political life, especially to investigate cases of high-ranking officials in the previous government embezzling state funds and trafficking weapons.

Tzannetakis said that the interim government will take the oath of office at noon on July 2nd, but the interim government will only exist for three months, after which new elections will be held.

    希腊将组成临时政府
    执政三月后重新举行大选
    新华社雅典7月1日电  希腊保守的新民主党议员察奈塔基斯（前译察内塔基斯）今天被授权组织一个临时政府，并得到了左派及进步力量联盟的支持。
    希腊于6月18日举行大选，但无一政党赢得绝对多数而单独组阁。察奈塔基斯是在得票最多的三个政党——新民主党、泛希社运和左派及进步力量联盟先后组阁均告失败的情况下，授权组织临时政府的。
    察奈塔基斯今晚发表讲话说，临时政府的唯一目的是澄清国家的政治生活，尤其要查明前政府高级官员侵吞国家巨款和贩卖武器等经济案件。
    察奈塔基斯说，临时政府将于7月2日中午宣誓就职，但临时政府只存在3个月，然后重新举行大选。
