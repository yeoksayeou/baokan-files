Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, July 21st.

The Burmese military government today announced that it would place Aung San Suu Kyi, the general secretary of the National League for Democracy, and Tin U, the chairman of the party, under house arrest.

The director of the government's news committee, U Kyaw Than, accused Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin U of "violating the law," "harming the country," and "creating a rift between the army and the people." He said that according to relevant laws, the two could be placed under house arrest for up to one year.

The 44-year-old Aung San Suu Kyi is the daughter of General Aung San, the founder of the Union of Burma. The 66-year-old Tin U was formerly the Minister of Defense of Burma. They established the National League for Democracy in September 1988.

It is estimated that the National League for Democracy currently has 1 million members, making it the largest of the 222 registered legal parties.

The Burmese authorities recently reiterated that they will hold multi-party democratic elections in May 1990.

    昂山素季和丁吴被软禁
    政府指责他们“违反了法律”
    新华社仰光7月21日电  缅甸军政府今天宣布将缅全国民主联盟总书记昂山素季和该党主席丁吴实行软禁。
    政府新闻委员会负责人吴觉桑今天在记者招待会上指责昂山素季和丁吴“违反了法律”，“给国家造成了危害”，“在军队和人民之间制造分裂”。他说，根据有关法律，这两人有可能被软禁一年。
    现年44岁的昂山素季是缅甸联邦创始人昂山将军的女儿。现年66岁的丁吴曾任缅甸国防部长。他们于1988年9月组建全国民主联盟。
    据估计，全国民主联盟目前有100万党员，被公认为是已经登记注册的222个合法政党中最大的一个。
    缅甸当局不久前重申，将于1990年5月举行有多党参加的民主大选。
