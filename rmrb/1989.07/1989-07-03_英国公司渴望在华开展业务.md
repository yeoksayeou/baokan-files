The Financial Times of Britain reported on June 30 that British companies which have established joint ventures with China or maintained long-term trade relations have not changed their strategies, but are more cautious in formulating new investment plans.

According to a responsible person from the British-China Trade Committee, John Byer, about half of the personnel who left have now returned, and the rest are planning to return in the coming weeks.

Percy Timberlake, an advisor to the 48 British groups that provide consulting services to companies doing business in China, said that the "problematic" companies are those that have always wanted to invest in China but previously had little experience. However, Timberlake believes that for every project delayed, there is an equal number of projects starting up. He said that companies with experience in trading with China are eager to resume business to prevent competitors from taking advantage. He has not heard of any British companies withdrawing their investments in China.

The Financial Times report said that the common wish of British companies is to hold onto the businesses they have painstakingly established in China. Gray Hack, the head of Ricardo Consulting Engineers, said, "We spent a long time establishing this company, and we do not want to give it up." John Carl, the regional sales director of the British United Shoe Machinery Company, said, "We have been doing business with China for 17 years, and we cannot suddenly stop."

The report concludes by saying that for many companies, the potential market in China remains the main attraction. Fred Smith, the head of A P V, which provides food industry equipment, said, "We have been doing business with China for 30 years. Although the transaction amount is only about $30 million in our total of $807 million, it may become our main market in the future."

    英国公司渴望在华开展业务
    本报讯　英国《金融时报》6月30日报道说，同中国建有合资公司或保持着长期贸易关系的英国公司看来并未改变它们的战略，但是，在制订新的投资计划的方面更加谨慎。
    据英中贸易委员会的一位负责人约翰·拜尔说，大约有一半离开的人员现在已返回，其余的人计划在今后几周内返回。
    就在中国的业务向公司的客户提供咨询的英国48家集团的顾问珀西·廷伯莱克说，“出问题的一类”公司是那些一直想在中国投资但先前又没有多少经验的公司。然而，廷伯莱克认为，每有一个项目延期，就会有同等数量的项目上马。他说，同中国进行贸易有经验的公司渴望重新开展业务以防其他竞争者钻空子。他没有听说英国公司撤回在华投资的事例。
    《金融时报》的报道说，英国公司的共同愿望是要保住它们在华的艰苦创立的业务。里卡多咨询工程公司的负责人格雷·哈克说：“我们花了很长时间才建立了这家公司，我们不愿放弃它。”英国联合制鞋机械公司地区销售部主任约翰·卡尔说：“我们已经同中国做了17年的生意了，我们不可能突然停止。”
    报道最后说，对许多公司来说，中国潜在的市场仍然是主要的吸引力。提供食品业设备的A P V公司负责人弗雷德·史密斯说：“我们同中国做了30年的生意，虽然成交额在我们8.07亿美元的总额中大约只占3000万美元。但假以时日它也许会成为我们的主要市场。”
