Hong Kong Government Financial Secretary Expresses Optimism About Trade with Mainland

HONG KONG, July 25 (Xinhua) — Hong Kong Government Financial Secretary Sir Philip Haddon-Cave today said that the economic and trade relations between Hong Kong and the mainland will continue to develop.

At the same time, he said the Hong Kong Government will try to persuade the U.S. Congress not to revoke China's most-favored-nation status.

Sir Philip Haddon-Cave today delivered a speech at the 29th annual meeting of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce on the issue of Hong Kong's external trade relations. He said that over the past decade, the value of goods traded between Hong Kong and the mainland has increased by an average of 39 percent annually. Now, the mainland is Hong Kong's largest source of imports and re-export market, and the second-largest export market. However, some pessimists doubt whether trade between the two places can continue to grow in light of recent events in China. Sir Philip Haddon-Cave said that China has repeatedly emphasized its desire to develop trade with all countries in the world. He believes that the momentum of China's economic development remains strong, which will ensure the continued development of medium- and long-term economic relations between the two places.

    香港政府财政司称对与内地贸易表示乐观
    据新华社香港7月25日电  （记者陈晓彬）香港政府财政司翟克诚今天表示，香港与内地间的经济贸易关系将会继续发展。
    同时，他表示香港政府将努力说服美国国会不要撤销对中国的最惠国待遇。
    翟克诚今天在香港工业总会第29届年会上就香港的对外贸易关系问题发表演说。他说，过去十年来，香港与内地的商品贸易额每年平均增长39％。现在内地是香港最大的进口货来源地和转口市场，第二大的出口市场。但一些悲观者怀疑，在最近中国所发生的事件情况下，两地间的贸易能否继续保持增长。翟克诚说，中国反复强调与世界各国发展贸易的愿望。他相信，中国经济发展的势头依然强劲，这将保证两地间的中长期经济关系持续发展。
