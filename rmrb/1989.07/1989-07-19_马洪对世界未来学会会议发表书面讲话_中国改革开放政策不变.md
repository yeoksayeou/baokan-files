Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 18th.

    Ma Hong, Director-General of the State Council's Center for Economic and Technological Development, delivered a written speech at the thematic group meeting of the 6th World Future Studies Federation Conference held here today. He pointed out that after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, China's reform and opening-up policy will not change.

    He said, "First, China's three-stage strategic goals will not change; second, the economic policies of reform and opening-up will not change; third, the independent and peaceful foreign policy will also not change."

    Ma Hong pointed out, "The reason for making such a choice is that we are very clear: if we abandon reform and opening-up, people's minds will inevitably be confined again, social productivity and all new things will be suppressed, the vibrant economic vitality will be stifled, the lively democratic political situation will become dull, and exchanges in various fields such as economy and culture with countries around the world will be blocked. China will fall back into the shackles of old ideas and old systems, and then China may take a path that goes against the goal of 'realizing modernization and revitalizing China.' This is contrary to the wishes and interests of the people of the whole country. We will not go back on the historical path."

    In elaborating on China's modernization development in three stages, Ma Hong said that China's modernization construction is a socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics. The socialist nature of China's social system is definite and unchangeable. China's reform and construction will be the self-development and perfection of socialism.

    He said, "It can be foreseen that the 21st century will be the century in which the socialist system will be increasingly perfect and mature. For China, the 21st century will be a new century in which it will enter the ranks of modernized socialist powers."

    Ma Hong also envisioned the prospects of the 21st century and pointed out that "peace and development are the two fundamental issues facing mankind today."

    Ma Hong said that the starting point of all China's diplomatic work is to serve the two major goals of peace and development. To promote the international situation to continue to develop in a direction of easing, the Chinese government advocates building a new international political order on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

    Ma Hong did not come to the United States to attend this conference. His written speech was warmly welcomed by the attendees.

    马洪对世界未来学会会议发表书面讲话
    中国改革开放政策不变
    新华社华盛顿7月18日电　中国国务院经济技术发展中心总干事马洪今天在这里举行的世界未来学会第六届大会专题小组会上发表的书面讲话中指出，在平息反革命暴乱后，中国改革开放政策不会改变。
    他说，“第一，中国分三个阶段的战略目标不会改变；第二，改革和开放的经济政策不会改变；第三，独立自主的和平外交政策也不会改变。”
    马洪指出，“所以做这样的选择，是因为我们十分清醒地懂得：如果放弃了改革和开放，人们的思想必然会重新被禁锢，社会生产力和一切新生事物会被压抑，繁荣活跃的经济活力会被窒息，生动民主的政治局面会变得死气沉沉，和世界各国的经济、文化等各个领域的交往就会被堵塞，中国将重新陷入旧思想、旧体制的束缚之中，那么中国就可能走上一条与‘实现现代化，振兴中华’的奋斗目标背道而驰的道路。这是与全国人民的愿望和利益相违背的。我们决不会走历史的回头路。”
    在阐述中国现代化发展的三个阶段时，马洪说，中国的现代化建设是具有中国特色的社会主义现代化。中国社会制度的社会主义性质这一点是确定无疑、不能改变的。中国的改革和建设，都将是社会主义的自我发展和完善。
    他说，“可以预见，二十一世纪将是社会主义制度日臻完善和走向成熟的世纪。对于中国来说，二十一世纪将是跨入社会主义现代化的大国、现代化强国之林的新世纪。”
    马洪还展望了二十一世纪的世界前景，并指出，“和平与发展的问题是当代人类面临的两个基本问题。”
    马洪说，中国外交工作的全部出发点都是服务于和平和发展两大目标的。为推动国际形势继续朝着缓和的方向发展，中国政府倡议在和平共处五项原则的基础上建立国际政治新秩序。
    马洪没有前来美国参加这次会议，他的书面发言，受到了与会者的热烈欢迎。
