Finland, located in Northern Europe, is known as the "Land of a Thousand Lakes." It is picturesque and has a pleasant environment, making it an ideal place for developing tourism.

A distinctive feature of Finland's tourism industry is that farmers build holiday villages, rural villas, and camping cabins for both local and foreign tourists to use during their vacations. Those who have grown tired of city life yearn for a "green holiday" or a taste of "natural adventure." The farmers' holiday villages cater to this desire, and business is booming. Guests at these villages can not only enjoy the beautiful scenery of nature but also participate in various tourist activities with a rural charm: picking strawberries, mushrooms, and other wild plants; fishing in inland lakes and by the sea; ice fishing in the winter; and visiting farms to learn about traditional and modern Finnish agriculture.

Finnish farmers began engaging in tourism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the past twenty years, the systematic development of these holiday villages has been supported by the national holiday hotel cooperative organization.

This organization assists farmers in conducting market research for tourism, organizing various seminars on tourism knowledge to improve the level of farmers' tourism business, and publishing books and magazines in multiple languages to introduce the accommodations and rich tourism activities available in farmers' holiday homes.

Finnish farmers' involvement in tourism not only promotes the development of the national tourism industry but also opens up a new source of income for farmers. Statistics show that this sideline business can increase farmers' annual income by 5% to 15%.

    芬兰农民兴办旅游业
    位于北欧的芬兰，素有“千湖之国”的美称，处处风景如画，环境宜人，具有发展旅游业的良好条件。
    农民自建假日村庄、乡村别墅、野营小屋，供本国或外国人度假使用，这是芬兰旅游业的一大特点。过腻了城市生活的人都渴望过一个“绿色假期”或领略一下“自然野趣”，农民的度假村正迎合了城市居民的这种心理，所以生意兴隆。游客在芬兰农民的度假村里，不仅能饱览大自然的迷人景色，还可参加具有田园情调的各种旅游活动：采集草莓、蘑菇和其它草本植物；在内湖和海边捕鱼；冬天在砸开的冰窟窿边垂钓；另外还可去农家作调查访问，了解芬兰传统及现代农业的发展情况等。
    芬兰农民搞旅游，始于六十年代末和七十年代初。近二十年来，芬兰农民度假村所以能有系统地不断发展，是由于得到国家度假旅馆联营组织的大力支持。
    该组织帮助农民搞旅游市场调查，举办各种旅游知识讲座，以提高农民办旅游业的水平，还以多种文字出版书刊，介绍农民度假住房情况和丰富多彩的游览项目。
    芬兰农民办旅游业，不仅有利于促进国家旅游业的发展，也为农户开辟了一个新财源。据统计，这项副业可使农户每年多收入百分之五至百分之十五。
