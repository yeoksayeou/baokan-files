In recent years, some spirit mediums and witches in the rural areas of our county have become active again. Before and after the Qingming Festival this year, the homes of these spirit mediums and witches were filled with smoke and incense, with a steady stream of visitors seeking spiritual guidance.

To deceive people into trusting them, these fraudsters claim that spirits possess them, muttering incantations and creating an aura of mystery. They use the pretense of helping people avoid disasters, predict marriages, foretell futures, and resolve disputes to swindle money and goods.

According to my on-site investigation, each spirit medium or witch receives at least 10 or more visitors seeking spiritual guidance per day, and sometimes as many as 50 to 60 people. To seek advice and draw lots, a visitor pays a minimum of 2 yuan in incense money, and sometimes as much as 10 or more yuan. A spirit medium or witch can earn 30 to 40 yuan of ill-gotten money in a day. On March 30, in Sanmiao Village, Sanmiao Township, I saw a witch in her forties prescribe a "spiritual remedy" for a farmer's wife: have the patient drink a bowl of water mixed with incense ash, burn 100 sheets of paper money for the deceased, and sprinkle a mixture of tea leaves and rice on the grave. Before leaving, the farmer took out 8 yuan as a fee.

### 神汉巫婆在潜山农村有市场

    神汉巫婆在潜山农村有市场
    近年来，我县农村的一些神汉巫婆又活跃起来。今年清明节前后，神汉巫婆家中乌烟瘴气，求仙客络绎不绝。
    为骗得人们的信任，这些装神弄鬼者谎称神仙附体，口中念念有词，故弄玄虚，打着为人消灾去厄、说婚姻、卜前途、化纠纷的幌子，骗钱骗物。
    据我实地调查，每个神汉、巫婆一天至少接待10多个求仙者，有时每天可接待五六十人。为了求签问卦，一个求仙者少则交2元香火费，多则交10多元。一个神汉或巫婆一天可赚三四十元昧心钱。3月30日，我在三妙乡三妙村见到一个40来岁的巫婆，为一个农民的妻子开“仙方”：让病人喝一碗掺入香灰的“仙水”，烧100张阴纸，用茶叶拌米洒在坟头上。这位农民临走时掏出了8元酬金。
