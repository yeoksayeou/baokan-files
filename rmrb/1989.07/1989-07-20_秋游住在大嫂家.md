Standing at the edge of a barren field, the autumn wind lifted the corners of my military coat. We took a train, a coal truck, and a bus, and it took us a day and a half to reach this place, which the locals call "Datan."

"Hey—come over here, we've found a place to stay," L shouted from the village entrance.

"That big sister is so hospitable. I just asked casually, and she said, 'Sure, sure, let's clean the house,' and she was so thorough. She even said they would go somewhere else to stay tonight," L said, beaming with joy.

"That's great, but we should leave some money when we leave."

"Of course," L continued excitedly, "At first, I even asked her, 'Little girl, where are your parents?' Actually, her son is already several years old."

We didn't walk far before we arrived. The big sister was standing at the doorstep with her son, timidly inviting us in. Both of their faces were flushed, and we stepped in lightly, one by one, thanking her.

"No matter where you go, there are always more good people than bad," G always remembered to say this.

Once inside, G quickly took out some candy for the boy, L kept thanking the big sister with a grateful smile, C hurriedly took a photo of the mother and son, insisting on taking the corn hanging under the eaves, saying it added atmosphere, and J suddenly noticed the boy's face was unusually red, so he quickly searched his bag for medicine, instructing him to take it.

"We should go outside to cook, so we don't bother the big sister," the big sister nodded vaguely in response.

Out in the wild, we built the stove, gathered firewood, and picked vegetables, but the fire just wouldn't burn well because the wind was too strong. But we seemed to have no anxiety or disappointment.

"Hey—she wants money again, one yuan per person," S's voice suddenly came, he had just gone back to get something. "After all that, she only agreed to eight yuan in total."

"Ah? How could she be like this?" "Well, since it's like this, why bother staying here?"

So, we packed our things and went back. J kept grumbling, "How despicable! If I had known this, I wouldn't have given her the medicine."

The big sister still looked at us vaguely as we entered the house. The child was lying lazily on the kang, his face not as red as before.

We rolled up our sleeves and started washing vegetables, taking turns when our hands got cold. We fetched basket after basket of firewood, digging a large hole in the haystack the big sister said was for feeding livestock. To roast the chicken, we dismantled the sheep pen gate made of twigs, telling the big sister who was trying to stop us, "Just build a new one." Even the half-oil, half-water oil bottle in the kitchen was used up. "Whoever meets us is unlucky," J joked. "If they don't show kindness, why should we?" Z reasoned.

After a busy afternoon, we were amazed! How did we make so much food, using up all the big sister's bowls, plates, and dishes, and still not having enough? And how did we suddenly think of frying the steamed buns to make them even more delicious? "This time it was worth it!"

Night fell, but the last pot of water just wouldn't boil. The big sister lit an oil lamp and finally spoke, "You haven't finished yet?"

"Almost, this stove is just too hard to use," Z said, a bit impatiently.

"I'll do it, you'll be here all night at this rate," she said, squatting down by the stove. "The chimney is all clogged up, how can it burn?" She quickly extinguished the fire, "Take the cooked food away, it will be ruined if the ashes fall in." In no time, she had scooped out a large basin of ash and relit the fire. The stove was glowing red. Seeing me standing by, she said, "Go ahead and eat, I'll call you when the water boils." She pulled the bellows, not looking up.

The big sister came in to settle the bill before leaving. "I'm not easy either, the kid is sick, let's say one yuan per person." "Hey, why did we come full circle?" Everyone argued, both on and off the kang, but in the end, we still rounded up to a whole number.

Before dawn, we got up early, packed our bags, and left. The big sister was still standing at the door. We said "goodbye" one by one, and she hurriedly said, "You came at a bad time this time, come back during your summer vacation, the meadow will be full of flowers, all kinds of colors, it's beautiful..."

    秋游住在大嫂家
    曾莉
    站在光秃秃的旷野边缘，深秋的风掀动着军大衣的衣角。坐火车、搭煤车、挤汽车，我们11个人花了一天半才到了这个当地人叫“大滩”的地方。
      “哎——快过来，找到住处了。”L在村头大声招呼着我们。
    “那大嫂可热情啦，我只是试着问问，她就说行呀行呀，赶紧收拾屋子，别提多干净了，还说他们晚上找别处去住。”L喜形于色。
      “太好了，那咱们走时也得留些钱才好。”
    “那当然。”L仍兴奋地止不住口，“一开始我还问人家：小姑娘，你们家大人呢？其实她儿子都好几岁了。”
    没走多远就到了，那大嫂正抱着儿子站在门槛外，怯声地让我们进屋。母子俩的脸都是红红的，我们轻步进去，依次不住声地谢她。
      “不管怎么说，世上还是好人多嘛。”无论到哪儿，G总忘不了这套话。
    进了屋，G就连忙掏糖果给那男孩，L一直满脸感激地跟大嫂聊着，C忙不迭地为母子俩“照个像”，还非要把屋檐下晾的玉米取上不可，说这样有气氛，J又忽然发现男孩脸红得异样，一摸是在发烧，便急急地翻包找药，嘱他吃了。
    “我们还是去外面埋锅造饭，别给大嫂添麻烦了。”大嫂听了，只是半解不解地点头应着。
    在野外，灶搭好了，柴拾好了，菜捡好了，就是火总也烧不好，风太大了，但我们似乎没有一丝焦虑和失望。
    “哎——人家又要钱了，每人一块。”S愤愤的声音忽然传来，他是刚才回去取东西的。“说了半天，才答应总共八块。”
      “啊？这人怎么这样呀？”“嗨！既然这样，咱们何必还在这儿将就？”
    于是，收拾了东西又回去。J一直恨恨不平：“真恶劣！早知这样，我也不把药给她了。”
    大嫂仍是半解不解地看着我们进屋，那孩子正懒懒地躺在炕上，似乎脸不像先前那么红了。
    我们憋足了劲，一桶桶地接水洗菜，手洗冷了便换个人接着干。一筐筐地取柴烧火，把大嫂说是喂牲口的草垛拦腰掏了个大洞。要架火烤鸡，便拆了枝条编的羊圈门，边拆边对在一旁劝阻的大嫂说：再编个新的多好。就是灶间半油半水的油瓶也用了个底光。“谁遇上咱们算是倒霉了。”J调侃了一句。“许他不仁就许我不义嘛。”Z振振有词。
    折腾一下午，我们自己也诧异了！怎么做了这么多的菜，把大嫂的盆、碗、碟用尽了还是盛不完？又怎么会忽然想起来馒头炸了更好吃？“这回可值了！”
    天黑下来了，最后一锅水却总是不开。大嫂拿了油灯点上，终于作声了：“还没弄完呢？”
    “早啦，这灶太不好烧了。”Z有点没好气。
    “俺来烧吧，你们这样到半夜也吃不上。”说着她蹲到了灶前，“灰都堵满了，还咋烧？”便麻利地熄火，“把做好的端走，一落灰就没法吃了。”不一会儿掏完了一大盆草灰就又点火，灶膛里顿时红红的。见我站在一边便说：“先去吃吧，水开了俺招呼你们。”手拉着风箱，头也没抬。
    大嫂临走进屋来算店钱。“俺也不容易，娃儿又病着，算算还是每人给一块吧。”“咦，怎么绕了一圈又回来了？”炕上炕下都争，没几句，最后还是凑了个整数。
    天刚亮就早早地起来，背包出门。大嫂仍是站在门口，我们依次说“再见”，她送出来竟忙不迭地说：“这回来得真不是时候，等你们放暑假了再来，那阵子草滩上全是花儿，啥色儿都有，好看着呢……”
