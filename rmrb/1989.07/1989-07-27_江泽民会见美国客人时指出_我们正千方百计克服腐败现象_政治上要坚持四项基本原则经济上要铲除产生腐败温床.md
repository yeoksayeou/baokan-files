Jiang Zemin Meets with American Guests, Stating That We Are Doing Everything Possible to Overcome Corruption

Politically, We Must Uphold the Four Cardinal Principles; Economically, We Must Eliminate the Breeding Grounds for Corruption

New China News Agency, Beijing, July 27th – This afternoon, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, met with Frank Pestana, Chairman of the Western Region of the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association, and the delegation of old friends from the U.S.-China People's Friendship Association, who are in China on a friendly visit. The hosts and guests had a cordial and unrestrained conversation.

Pestana said that he and his colleagues were very pleased to be able to visit China at this time, to meet with people from all walks of life, and to learn the truth about what has happened in China recently.

Jiang Zemin said, "Seeing is believing, and facts speak louder than words. It is very good that you have come to China to see the facts for yourselves. Recently, there have been many rumors about China circulating around the world, and some people have made judgments based on their imagination. In fact, foreign friends who come here can draw correct conclusions by seeing with their own eyes."

Jiang Zemin answered the questions raised by the guests.

Pestana asked: "Under the leadership of Chairman Deng Xiaoping, China's economic construction and reform and opening up have developed very well, but corruption has also emerged. How will China solve this problem?"

Jiang Zemin said, "We insist on reform and opening up. We will learn from the advanced technology and scientifically sound management experience of foreign countries. However, while opening up to the outside world, some decadent elements of capitalism will also come in. Our country has indeed seen some corruption, although from an overall perspective, the vast majority of our Party members and cadres are good."

He said, "We are resolutely opposed to corruption. We are doing everything possible to overcome all corrupt practices. Politically, we must uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, strengthen education, and strengthen the legal system; economically, we must eliminate the breeding grounds for corruption, rectify some companies in the circulation sector that do not meet the conditions, and deal with illegal individual business operators according to law."

When discussing the issue of distribution, Jiang Zemin said, "We oppose egalitarianism and the 'iron rice bowl,' but we must also resolutely solve the problem of unfair distribution to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of industrial workers and intellectuals in our country."

Present at the meeting were Zhang Wenjin, President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Zhu Qizhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, among others.

    江泽民会见美国客人时指出
    我们正千方百计克服腐败现象
    政治上要坚持四项基本原则经济上要铲除产生腐败温床
    新华社北京7月27日电　中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见了正在中国进行友好访问的美中友协西部地区主席弗兰克·佩斯塔纳和由他率领的美中友协老朋友代表团。宾主进行了亲切的、无拘束的交谈。
    佩斯塔纳说，他和他的同事们为能在这个时候到中国访问，接触各界人士，了解不久前中国所发生的事情的真相而感到非常高兴。
    江泽民说，百闻不如一见，事实胜于雄辩。你们亲自到中国来看看事实真相是很好的。前一阵世界上流传着不少关于中国的谣言，还有些人凭想象来判断中国发生的事情。其实，外国朋友到这里来用自己的眼睛看一看就能得出正确的结论。
    江泽民回答了客人们提出的问题。
    佩斯塔纳问：在邓小平主席的领导下，中国的经济建设和改革开放有了很好的发展，但也出现了腐败现象，中国将如何解决这个问题？
    江泽民说，我们坚持改革和开放。对外国的先进技术和合乎科学的管理经验，我们都要学习。但在对外开放的同时，资本主义的一些腐朽东西也会进来。我们国家确实出现了一些腐败现象，尽管从整体上看我们绝大多数党员和干部是好的。
    他说，我们坚决反对腐败，我们正在千方百计地克服一切腐败现象。在政治上，我们要坚持四项基本原则，要加强教育，加强法制；在经济上，要铲除产生腐败的温床，要整顿一些流通领域里的不符合条件的公司，对一些不法个体户也要依法处理。
    在谈到分配问题时，江泽民说，我们既反对平均主义的“大锅饭”，也一定要下决心解决分配不公的问题，以调动我国广大产业工人和知识分子的积极性。
    会见时在座的有对外友协会长章文晋、外交部副部长朱启祯等。
