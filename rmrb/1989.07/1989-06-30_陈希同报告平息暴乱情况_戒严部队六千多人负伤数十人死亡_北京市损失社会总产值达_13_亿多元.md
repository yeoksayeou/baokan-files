    Chen Xitong, a member of the State Council and the Mayor of Beijing, reported to the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress on behalf of the State Council. He introduced the situation of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. He said that during the riots, more than 6,000 martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers were injured, and dozens died.

    Chen Xitong said that during the days of the riots, more than 1,280 military vehicles, police cars, and public buses were smashed, burned, and damaged. Among them, more than 1,000 were military vehicles, more than 60 were armored vehicles, more than 30 were police cars, more than 120 were public buses, and more than 70 were other motor vehicles. A batch of weapons and ammunition were also looted.

    He said that to suppress the counter-revolutionary riots and avoid greater losses, the martial law troops, after suffering heavy casualties and being unable to advance despite repeated warnings, had to fire warning shots into the air and counterattack. They killed some rampaging rioters. Due to the large number of onlookers, some were hit by cars or trampled, some were injured by stray bullets, and some were shot by armed thugs. According to the information available, more than 3,000 non-military personnel were injured during the riots, and more than 200 died, including 36 college students.

    Chen Xitong said that among them, there were guilty rioters who deserved punishment, innocent bystanders who were mistakenly injured, and medical staff, neighborhood watch members, and order-maintenance team members who were on duty at the scene. The government will do a good job of follow-up work for the innocent bystanders and those injured while on duty.

    He said that due to the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, Beijing alone suffered a loss of more than 13 billion yuan in total social output value.

    陈希同报告平息暴乱情况
    戒严部队六千多人负伤数十人死亡
    北京市损失社会总产值达13亿多元
    新华社北京6月30日电  国务委员、北京市长陈希同受国务院委托今天在向七届人大常委会第八次会议作关于制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的情况报告中介绍，在北京发生的反革命暴乱中，戒严部队、武警战士、公安干警共有6000多人负伤，死亡数十人。
    陈希同说，在几天的暴乱中，被暴徒砸毁、烧毁、损坏的军车、警车和公共电汽车等车辆达1280多辆，其中军用汽车1000多辆，装甲车60多辆，警车30多辆，公共电汽车120多辆，其它机动车70多辆，一批武器、弹药被抢。
    他说，为了平息反革命暴乱，避免造成更大的损失，戒严部队在伤亡严重、忍无可忍、让无可让而又很难前进的情况下，经过一再警告，迫不得已奉命对空鸣枪开道，进行反击，击毙了一些肆虐的暴徒，由于围观的人很多，有的被车撞、人挤，有的被流弹误伤，有的被持枪歹徒击伤。据已经掌握的情况，暴乱中有3000多名非军人受伤，200余人死亡，包括36名大学生。
    陈希同说，这当中，有罪有应得的暴徒，有被误伤的群众，还有正在现场执行任务的医护人员、联防人员和维护秩序工作队员等。对于被误伤的群众和执行任务中受伤害的人员，政府要认真做好善后工作。
    他说，由于动乱和反革命暴乱，仅北京市就损失社会总产值13亿多元。
