Mexico, Colombia, and Venezuela Form a Group to Support Peaceful Development and Advance Integration

		Mexico City, July 11 (Xinhua) — Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today in Bogota stated that Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela have formed a new three-country group to support the peaceful development of Central America and advance the integration process of Latin American countries.

		Salinas made the statement upon concluding his visit to Colombia. Earlier, Salinas had visited Venezuela from July 8 to 10. In a joint statement, Mexico and Venezuela expressed that, based on the results of consultations among the foreign ministers of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela on March 12 this year, they would jointly formulate new areas of common action with Colombia to promote the peaceful resolution of crises facing Central American countries through peaceful means; and urge the governments of Central American countries to overcome obstacles and successfully hold the scheduled summit meeting. On the basis of coordination between the leaders of Mexico and Venezuela, the leaders of Mexico and Colombia also reached a consensus, thus establishing political cooperation among the three countries. At the same time, Mexico also signed a large number of cooperation agreements, memorandums of understanding, and protocols with Venezuela and Colombia in the fields of economy, trade, finance, energy, and science and technology, and reached cooperation agreements in the fight against drug trafficking. As the two largest oil-producing countries in Latin America, Mexico and Venezuela have reached an agreement for the 10th consecutive year to extend the "San Jose Agreement" to provide preferential oil supplies to Central American and Caribbean countries.

		Salinas explained to the press the purpose of forming the three-country group, saying that the group's immediate goal is to seek joint action to help Central America achieve peace and development, and further promote the regional integration process within the existing integration organizations of Latin American countries.

		Official and diplomatic sources here believe that the establishment of the three-country group indicates that the Contadora Group, formerly composed of the above three countries and Panama, has come to an end.

    墨委哥3国结成集团
    支持和平发展　推进一体化进程
    本报墨西哥城7月11日电  记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥总统萨利纳斯今天在波哥大声称，哥伦比亚、墨西哥与委内瑞拉组成了新的3国集团，支持中美洲和平发展，推进拉美国家的一体化进程。
    萨利纳斯是在结束对哥伦比亚访问时作出上述声明的。在这以前，萨利纳斯已经于8日到10日访问了委内瑞拉。墨西哥与委内瑞拉的联合声明表示，将根据哥伦比亚、墨西哥、委内瑞拉3国外长今年3月12日磋商的结果，联合哥伦比亚制订新的共同行动领域，推动中美洲国家通过和平途径解决该地区面临的危机；敦促中美洲国家政府克服障碍、开好预定的首脑会议。在墨、委两国首脑协调的基础上，墨、哥两国首脑又达成了一致，从而建立起上述3国之间的政治合作。同时，墨西哥也与委、哥两国之间签署了大量经济、贸易、金融、能源及科学技术等方面的合作协定、意向书与议定书，并在各自间达成在反贩毒斗争方面的合作协定、墨西哥与委内瑞拉作为拉美的两个最大产油国，又连续第10年达成协议，延长向中美洲与加勒比国家优惠供应石油的“圣何塞协定”。
    萨利纳斯向新闻界解释组成3国集团的目的时说，该集团近期目标是寻求帮助中美洲争取和平与发展方面采取共同行动，并且在拉美国家现有一体化组织的范围内，进一步推动地区一体化进程。
    此间官方与外交人士认为，3国集团的成立表明过去由上述3国及巴拿马组成的孔塔多拉集团已经寿终正寝。
