Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st.

Today, the spokesperson for the State Education Commission answered questions from journalists in the capital regarding the widely discussed issue of the adjustment of enrollment plans for ordinary colleges and universities this year.

Q: It is said that at the national conference on higher education institutions held on July 15th, the issue of adjusting the enrollment plan for ordinary colleges and universities this year was discussed. Will the enrollment plan be reduced?

A: There has been a slight adjustment. However, it is not the "significant reduction" as rumored in society. Recently, the State Education Commission and the State Planning Commission, based on the actual problems in the development of higher education and the heavy rectification tasks facing colleges and universities, jointly decided to slightly adjust the enrollment plan for ordinary colleges and universities. It is proposed to reduce the initial plan of 640,000 by approximately 30,000, about 5%. At the same time, some supplementary measures will be taken to minimize the social impact, such as increasing the enrollment of ordinary undergraduate classes for radio and television universities in some provinces and cities this year to meet the requirements of high school graduates for further education, and strive to keep the total number of high school graduates admitted to higher education basically unchanged. Of course, from a long-term perspective, most high school graduates do face an employment issue, but this should be solved comprehensively, mainly through the development of vocational and technical education, and not by increasing the number of college enrollments.

Q: Why is it necessary to adjust the enrollment plan for ordinary colleges and universities?

A: The decision to slightly reduce the enrollment of ordinary colleges and universities is mainly due to three reasons. First, in recent years, the development of higher education in China has been relatively rapid, but the educational conditions of many schools have not kept up, and the teaching conditions and student life order have not been adequately guaranteed, which not only affects the quality of education but also becomes an important factor in the instability of schools. Especially last year, some places and some colleges and universities arbitrarily exceeded the planned enrollment, which further exacerbated this situation. Second, the phenomenon of difficulty in job placement for graduates of some disciplines has persisted this year. Although this difficulty is temporary, as the responsible persons of the educational authorities and colleges and universities, we should look further ahead, but this is indeed a reality that cannot be ignored for the time being; as educators, we should consider this realistic factor. Moreover, socialist higher education, in terms of its educational policy, should strive to make the plan for cultivating talents basically consistent with the needs of society, which should be a principle. Third, some disciplines (such as certain social science departments) have long been unclear in their educational direction and urgently need to be rectified and enriched in teaching content to further clarify the training objectives, so as to meet the needs of socialist construction. It is based on the above three reasons that we consider adjusting the enrollment plans of some ordinary colleges and universities, and we hope to obtain the understanding, support, and cooperation of all sectors of society, especially the examinees and their parents.

Q: Will the adjustment of the enrollment plan have an adverse impact on the enrollment work?

A: This adjustment is a local adjustment for both local authorities and colleges and universities and will not affect the overall enrollment work. Of course, due to the late timing of the adjustment, there will be some impact, and we hope to minimize this impact. Now, the unified examination has been completed, and the scoring and marking work is almost finished. Soon, the enrollment work in various places will enter the admission stage one after another. We hope that the enrollment departments in various places and the relevant colleges and universities will seize the time, strengthen coordination, understand each other, and, in accordance with the deployment of the conference on higher education work, quickly complete the specific implementation work after the adjustment of the plan, and promptly announce the enrollment numbers of colleges and universities in various places to the examinees. They should also seriously organize the filling of the examinees' choices. Some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have organized the filling of choices before the unified examination, and the enrollment departments in these places should seriously do a good job in adjusting the choices or reorganizing the filling, so as to truly respect the examinees' choices during the admission, conduct fair selection, and ensure that the new students meet the qualified requirements in terms of morality, intelligence, and physical fitness. The procedures for enrollment work can be appropriately adjusted, and the admission time and the time for new students to enter school can be appropriately delayed.

This year's admission of new students by colleges and universities is being carried out after the decisive victory in suppressing the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion nationwide and the convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party, which creates a good "environment" for our work. We should make full use of this favorable condition and do a good job in the college enrollment work this year.

    就今年全国普通高校减少招生一事
    国家教委发言人答记者问
    因办学条件学科整顿等各种原因减招三万人
    部分省市电大专科班将扩大招生以作为补充
    本报北京7月21日讯　记者周庆报道：今天，国家教委发言人就目前社会上普遍关心的普通高校核减招生计划一事，回答了首都一些新闻记者提出的问题。
    问：据说，在本月15日结束的全国高等学校工作会议上讨论了调整今年普通高校招生计划的问题，招生计划数是不是要削减？
    答：是作了少量的调整。但绝不是目前社会上所传的“大幅度削减”。最近，国家教委和国家计委根据当前高等教育事业发展过程中存在的实际问题以及高等学校面临的繁重的整顿任务，共同研究确定普通高校招生计划要略加调整，拟在年初安排的64万基础上，核减3万人左右，约占5％。与此同时，采取一些补充措施，以减少由此带来的社会影响，例如，今年将增加部分省市招收面向应届高中毕业生的电大普通专科班，以尽量满足高中毕业生的升学要求，力争使高中毕业生总的升学人数大体保持不变。当然，从长远讲，多数高中毕业生确实存在一个就业问题，但这要统筹解决，主要应通过发展职业技术教育来解决，不能靠增加高校招生计划数来解决。
    问：为什么要调整普通高等学校的招生计划？
    答：这次决定少量调减普通高等学校的招生计划，主要有三方面的原因。一，近年来我国高等教育发展速度比较快，但许多学校的办学条件没有相应地跟上去，教学条件和学生生活秩序得不到应有的保证，不仅影响教育质量，也成为学校不安定的重要因素。尤其是去年招生时，某些地方和某些高校擅自超计划录取新生，更加剧了这种状况。二，这几年高校毕业分配中出现的部分学科毕业生分配困难的现象，在今年分配过程中仍然存在。虽然这种困难只是暂时的，作为教育主管部门和高等学校的负责人应该看得远一点，但这终究是现实，一时还难以解决；作为办学者，应对学生负责，不能不考虑这一现实因素。而且社会主义高等教育在办学方针上，总是要使培养人才的计划，力求同社会的需求基本相适应，这应该是一条原则。三，部分学科（例如某些社会科学的系科）在办学方向上长期不甚明确，急需通过整顿和充实教学内容，进一步明确培养目标，才能使之符合社会主义建设的需要。我们正是基于以上三方面原因来考虑调整部分普通高校招生计划的，希望得到社会各界尤其是考生和家长的谅解、理解和支持。
    问：现在调整招生计划，是否会给招生工作带来不利影响？
    答：这次调整，对地方和高校来说，都是局部调整，并不影响招生工作的全局。当然，由于调整的时间偏晚了点，影响肯定会有的，我们希望尽量缩小这一影响。现在，统一考试已经结束，评分阅卷工作也快接近尾声，不久各地招生工作就将先后进入录取阶段。我们希望各地招生部门和各有关高等学校抓紧时间，加强协调，相互谅解，按照高校工作会议的部署，尽速做好计划调整后的具体落实工作，尽快向考生公布高校在各地的招生数字，并认真组织好考生填报志愿。有些省、自治区、直辖市在统考前已组织考生填报了志愿，这些地方的招生部门应认真做好志愿的调整工作，或者重新组织填报，以保证在录取时能真正尊重考生志愿，进行公平的选拔，切实保证新生德智体诸方面均达到合格要求。招生工作的程序，可以适当进行调整，录取时间和新生入学时间可以适当延迟。
    今年高校录取新生是在全国制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱取得了决定性胜利和召开了党的十三届四中全会以后进行的，这就为我们的工作创造一个好的“大环境”，我们要充分利用这一有利条件，认真做好今年高校招生工作。
