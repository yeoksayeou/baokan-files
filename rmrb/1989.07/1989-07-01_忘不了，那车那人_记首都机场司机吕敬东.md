	Unforgettable, That Car and That Person
	— Remembering Capital Airport Driver Lü Jiedong
	Liu Shiren Zhang Miaoji Chen Fuyu

	On June 30, leaders from a certain unit of the martial law troops presented a plaque inscribed with the words “Supporting the Army, Suppressing the Rebellion, Exemplary Model” to the Capital Airport Life Service Company. This was to express their gratitude to the company’s driver Lü Jiedong, who risked his life to rescue and transport the martial law troops to Tiananmen Square on time, helping them complete their mission.

	On the early morning of June 4, around 4 AM, the Fourth Company, which had been besieged and attacked by thugs and misled crowds for over nine hours near the Beijing Broadcasting Institute, finally broke through the encirclement with the main force. Unfortunately, their vehicle stalled just a kilometer away. To avoid delaying the rest of the convoy, the Fourth Company’s vehicle had to pull over for repairs. At this critical moment, Lü Jiedong, a driver from the Capital Airport Life Service Company, was returning from a delivery to Gaobeidian. He was driving a red-orange Liberator heavy-duty truck and saw a young officer waving to stop his car. Lü Jiedong stopped immediately. The platoon leader, Xu Guangfu, explained the situation and asked him to help transport the company to Tiananmen Square. Without hesitation, Lü Jiedong gestured for the officers and soldiers to board his truck. He then found a rope in the cab, about two centimeters in diameter, and tied it into several strands to tow the Fourth Company’s vehicle. He sped towards Tiananmen Square like lightning.

	Lü Jiedong’s actions left the thugs astonished: “At this time, someone actually dares to risk their life to save soldiers!” “Kill the driver, he’s a traitor from Beijing!” They shouted wildly while throwing bricks, stones, and Molotov cocktails at the red-orange truck. The rearview mirror shattered, the windshield shattered, the platoon leader sitting on the right side of the cab was injured, and Lü Jiedong’s leg was pierced by shattered glass, bleeding profusely. However, Lü Jiedong paid no heed to the danger. He skillfully avoided the roadblocks and drove straight into Tiananmen Square. The “Sniper Fourth Company,” with its glorious tradition, arrived at the designated position on time with the help of the young driver Lü Jiedong.

	When the clearing operation was over, the regiment commander discovered this special military vehicle and learned of its origin. He was deeply moved by Lü Jiedong’s actions and said, “You are an outstanding representative of Beijing people. All the officers and soldiers of our regiment thank you!” The kind and honest Lü Jiedong blushed and said, “It’s nothing. This is what any upright Beijing person should do.”

	Considering the special circumstances at the time, the regiment leader suggested that he stay with the troops temporarily until the situation calmed down before sending him back. Lü Jiedong agreed enthusiastically, saying that he would follow the troops wherever they went as long as they needed him.

	Thus, Lü Jiedong, an ordinary Beijing citizen and truck driver, became the only non-military “soldier” in Tiananmen Square during this special period. His red-orange truck also became a “special military vehicle” in the green convoy. The regiment commander assigned his car to the convoy, and he himself, like the officers and soldiers of the Fourth Company, ate compressed biscuits when hungry, drank cold water when thirsty, and slept in the cab when tired. When scattered comrades returned, he greeted them like family, shaking hands and embracing them.

	Lü Jiedong was not one to sit idle. When the soldiers went on duty, he went to the parking lot, either repairing the vehicles or inflating the tires. In just four days, he fixed five malfunctioning military vehicles, eliminated over fifty potential hazards, and inflated the tires of eight vehicles.

	On the evening of June 4, it started raining heavily. The officers and soldiers of the Fourth Company, who had nothing but the clothes on their backs and their weapons, had to stand in the rain. The rain soaked the officers and soldiers, but it pained Lü Jiedong’s heart. He drove through the rain to tow an old bus, cleaned it out, and invited the officers and soldiers to take shelter and rest. To ensure that the officers and soldiers could hear the Party Central Committee’s voice in a timely manner, he found an old loudspeaker on the square and used the recording device in his own car to set up a small broadcast. The soldiers gathered to listen to the martial law command’s announcements and important news from the Central Radio Station.

	Lü Jiedong treated the company as his own family, and the officers and soldiers of the Fourth Company did not treat him as an outsider. When they entered the square, he was wearing only shorts and a tank top. To keep him warm, the officers and soldiers gave him their uniforms and blankets. Bread and pickled vegetables were the best food at the time, and everyone saved their portions to give to Lü Jiedong.

	On June 7, the troops were to leave Tiananmen Square, and Lü Jiedong drove his red-orange truck to take the Fourth Company’s officers and soldiers to their new duty station.

	On June 9, Lü Jiedong was to bid farewell to the Fourth Company and return to his workplace. The regiment leaders came, and the injured soldiers who were in the hospital also came. Everyone gathered, reluctant to part, like friends saying goodbye or sending a loved one off on a journey...

	Lü Jiedong left, carrying his love for the Fourth Company and the People’s Liberation Army. He also carried the mission to expose the rumors with his personal experience and what he had seen. Wherever he went, he proudly told people the truth about suppressing the rebellion.

	The People’s Liberation Army will not forget him. The twenty-eight officers and soldiers who were rescued and transported to Tiananmen Square by Lü Jiedong jointly wrote a letter to his unit, introducing his heroic deeds and recommending him for an award.

	The martial law troops’ party committee wrote to the relevant departments, suggesting that the car he drove be awarded the title of “Meritorious Vehicle.”

	Lü Jiedong’s unit also reported to the higher authorities to award him a first-class merit citation and promote him to a higher pay grade.

    忘不了，那车那人
    ——记首都机场司机吕敬东
    刘世仁　张妙奇　陈福玉
    六月三十日，戒严部队某部领导将一块刻有“拥军平暴、堪称楷模”八个大字的牌匾送到首都机场生活服务公司，感谢该公司司机吕敬东冒着生命危险解救、运送戒严部队官兵按时到达天安门广场并帮助他们完成了任务。
    六月四日凌晨四时许，在北京广播学院一带被歹徒和不明真相群众堵截、围攻长达九个多小时的四连，终于跟随大部队冲出了包围。不巧的是，开进不到一公里，他们所乘的车辆突然熄火了。为不影响后面的车队开进，四连的车不得不靠边检修。这时一伙歹徒手持棍棒、砖头、石块、燃烧瓶，冲了过来。在这危急关头，去高碑店送货归来的首都机场生活服务公司车队司机吕敬东，驾驶着一辆桔红色的解放牌载重汽车恰好路过这里，见一名年轻军官举手拦车，便停了下来。带车的指导员许广福说明了情况，请求他帮忙把连队送往天安门广场。吕敬东二话没说，挥手让干部战士上了自己的汽车。之后，他又从驾驶室里找出了一根直径不到两厘米的麻绳，折成几股，拖起四连的汽车，风驰电掣般地向天安门广场疾驶。吕敬东的这一举动使歹徒们目瞪口呆：“这种时候，竟然有人敢冒死救当兵的！”“打死那开车的，他是北京人的叛徒！”他们一边狂喊乱叫，一边将砖头、石块、燃烧瓶雨点般地投向这辆桔红色汽车。倒视镜碎了，挡风玻璃碎了，坐在驾驶室右边的指导员受伤了，吕敬东的腿部也被砸碎的玻璃扎得鲜血直流。可吕敬东全然不顾，巧妙地躲过道道路障，一直开进天安门广场。有着光荣传统的“神枪手四连”，在青年司机吕敬东的帮助下，准时按上级的要求到达了预定的位置。
    清场结束时，团首长发现了这辆特殊军车并了解到它的来历，深深被吕敬东的行为感动了，他拉住小吕的手说：“你是北京人的优秀代表，我们全团官兵感谢你！”善良而又憨厚的吕敬东红着脸说：“没啥。这是任何一个正直的北京人都应该做的。”
    团领导根据当时的特殊情况，建议他暂时不要离开部队，待事态平静一些再送他回去。吕敬东痛快地表示，只要部队需要，部队走到哪儿他就跟到哪儿。
    就这样，吕敬东这位普通的北京市民、汽车司机，成了特殊时期天安门广场内唯一没有军籍的“士兵”，他驾驶的那辆桔红色汽车也成为绿色车队中的“特殊军车”。团长把他的车编进了车队，他本人也同四连的干部战士一样，饿了啃几口压缩饼干，渴了喝几口凉水，困了钻进驾驶室打个盹。被冲散的同志回来了，他像迎接亲人一样跑上去握手、拥抱。
    吕敬东是个闲不住的人。战士们上岗值勤去了，他也来到停车场，不是检修车辆，就是给轮胎充气。在短短的四天里，他修好了五台有故障的军车，排除了五十多处隐患，给八辆车的轮胎充了气。
    六月四日傍晚，天下起了大雨。除了穿在身上的衣服和随身携带的武器弹药别无它物的四连官兵，只好站立在雨中。雨淋在干部战士身上，却痛在吕敬东心里。他冒雨开车拖来一台旧大客车，把里面打扫干净后请官兵们住进去躲雨、休息。为了让干部战士及时听到党中央的声音，他还从广场上找来一个旧喇叭，利用自己车上的录音装置安装了一个小广播，战士们没事就聚在一起收听戒严指挥部的通知和中央电台重要新闻。
    吕敬东把连队当成了自己的家，四连的官兵也没把他当外人。进广场时，他只穿了一条短裤和一件背心。为了给他御寒，干部战士有的脱下了自己的军装，有的送来了毛巾被。面包和榨菜，这是当时最好的食物，大家都把自己的那份省下来送给吕敬东。
    六月七日，部队要调离天安门广场，吕敬东又开着那辆桔红色汽车把四连官兵送到了新的执勤点。
    六月九日，吕敬东要告别四连回自己的工作单位。团领导赶来了，受伤住院的战士也赶来了，大家聚在一起恋恋不舍，依依惜别。那情，那景，既像朋友离别，又似送亲人远行……
    吕敬东走了，他是带着对四连、对人民军队的爱恋走的，也是带着用自己的亲身经历和眼见事实去揭穿谣言的任务走的。他无论走到那里，都理直气壮地向人们讲述平息暴乱的真情。
    人民军队不会忘记他。被吕敬东营救并送往天安门广场的二十八名官兵联名给他所在单位写信，介绍他的英雄事迹，为他请功。
    戒严部队某部党委上书有关部门，建议给他驾驶的那台车授予“功勋车”称号。
    吕敬东所在单位也报请上级给他记一等功，并晋升一级工资。
