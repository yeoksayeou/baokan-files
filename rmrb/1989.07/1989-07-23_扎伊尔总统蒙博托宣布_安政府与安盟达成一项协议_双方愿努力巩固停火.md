The second round of talks between the Angolan government and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) held in Zaire concluded today. Both sides expressed their commitment to strengthening the ceasefire that has been in effect since June 24.

The Angolan People's Radio reported tonight that the head of the Angolan government delegation and Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Francisco "Samakuva" Franca, spoke to Angolan journalists in Kinshasa. He said that consolidating the ceasefire is the first step in implementing the peace plan. On this basis, further negotiations can be conducted on the other principles determined by the African heads of state summit on June 22. He noted that the negotiations were suspended due to UNITA's reservations on some issues, and they will return to their headquarters for consultations. The talks will resume on July 31.

He pointed out that the negotiations between the Angolan government and UNITA were conducted in a normal atmosphere. Both sides discussed measures to achieve domestic peace in a complete, lasting, and peaceful manner.

    扎伊尔总统蒙博托宣布
    安政府与安盟达成一项协议
    双方愿努力巩固停火
    据新华社金沙萨7月21日电　安哥拉外交部长佩德罗·范迪嫩与反政府武装组织“争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟”（安盟）主席萨文比就在安哥拉实现全面和解的两个重要问题达成协议。
    这是扎伊尔总统蒙博托今天在全国执委会（政府）的一次会议上宣布的。
    根据这项协议，安哥拉双方同意从1989年7月19日12时起，停止一切敌对的宣传；建立一个由安哥拉人民解放军和安盟武装力量组成的军事委员会，负责确保停火协议的严格执行。
    据新华社罗安达7月22日电　安哥拉政府和争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟（安盟）在扎伊尔举行的第二轮会谈今天结束，双方表示将努力巩固从6月24日起实行的停火。
    安哥拉人民电台今晚报道安哥拉政府代表团团长、武装部队总参谋长弗兰萨今天在金沙萨对安哥拉记者发表讲话时说，巩固停火是实施和平计划的第一步，在此基础上才能进一步谈判6月22日非洲国家首脑会议上确定的其它原则。他说，会谈在涉及其它问题时，由于安盟对一些问题持保留态度，表示将返回其总部磋商，因而谈判中断，将于7月31日继续举行谈判。
    他指出，安哥拉政府与安盟的这次谈判是在正常气氛中举行的，双方讨论了以完全、持久、和平方式实现国内和平的措施。
