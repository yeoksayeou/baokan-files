On June 21, seven leading U.S. electronics and semiconductor companies, including International Business Machines (IBM), announced the formation of a major joint venture company, American Memory Chip Corporation, primarily to produce dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. This unusual move, where former competitors suddenly become "partners in the same boat," is intriguing.

DRAM chips are currently the most advanced type of chip on the market and are a key component of electronic computers, often referred to as the "brain." Some even compare it to the "best technological catalyst," suggesting that its mass production will drive the continuous improvement of new technologies. Initially invented by U.S. companies, DRAM chips saw many American firms withdraw due to sluggish market demand and fierce competition from Japanese companies in the early 1980s. Currently, the global market for DRAM chips with a storage capacity of one megabit has an annual sales volume of approximately $6 billion, with 90% controlled by Japanese companies and only a small share held by a few U.S. firms. However, last year, the demand for these chips in the U.S. surged, leading to a supply shortage. U.S. computer companies were forced to purchase Japanese chips at high prices. Against this backdrop, some U.S. companies began considering the establishment of a large joint venture to produce DRAM chips with a storage capacity of four megabits and other semiconductor chips. According to the New York Times, these chips with larger storage capacity will be a new product in the intense U.S.-Japan high-tech competition in the early 1990s. Their production is crucial for the development of U.S. electronic products and will be a key factor in determining U.S. competitiveness in areas such as high-definition television and computers.

According to the plan, the American Memory Chip Corporation will begin construction by the end of this year and is expected to start production in the first half of 1991. It is estimated that the company will invest $1 billion over the next few years, with half of the funds provided by the member companies and the other half through loans. The key technology will be provided by IBM.

However, the company currently faces a legal issue regarding whether it violates the U.S. "Anti-Trust Law." However, indications suggest that the government will give it the green light. The Secretary of Commerce has already welcomed the company's establishment. Other government officials have also expressed support for relaxing the "Anti-Trust Law" to allow the formation of large joint ventures.

The formation of a large joint venture by several high-tech product manufacturing companies is unprecedented in U.S. history over the past few decades. The purpose is clear: as stated by some trade experts in the Wall Street Journal, it is to "counter Japan's technological challenges." The president of IBM also stated that this move is to "revitalize the U.S. electronics industry." Some predict that if this precedent succeeds, other industries may follow suit. It seems that the U.S. will change its tactics in high-tech and other trade competitions, attempting to break out of the predicament. This is a noteworthy new trend.

    美日高科技领域竞争新动向
    本报记者　张亮
    以国际商业机器公司为首的7家美国电子计算机、半导体公司6月21日宣布成立一个主要生产动态随机存取存储芯片的大型联合公司——美国存储芯片有限公司，昔日的竞争对手突然间变成了“同舟共济”的合作伙伴。这一不寻常的举动耐人寻味。
    动态随机存取存储芯片是目前市场上最先进的一种芯片，也是电子计算机的关键部件或者说“头脑”。有人甚至把它比作“最好的技术策动器”，即“这种芯片的大规模生产将会带动新的创造技术的不断完善”。它最初是由美国公司发明的，但由于80年代初市场需求不旺以及日本公司仍激烈竞争，许多美国公司相继告退。目前，世界存储信息容量为一兆毕特的动态随机存取存储芯片的年销售额大约为60亿美元，其中90％被日本公司垄断，美国几家公司只占很少的份额。然而，去年美国对这种芯片的需求量猛增，出现了供不应求的紧张局面。美国电子计算机公司不得不出高价购买日本芯片。在此背景下，美国一些公司开始考虑成立一个生产存储信息容量为4兆毕特的动态随机存取存储芯片及其它半导体芯片的大型联合公司。据《纽约时报》称，这种存储信息容量更大的芯片将是90年代初美日在高技术领域激烈竞争的一种新产品。它对美国电子产品的发展前景至关重要，能否控制这种芯片的生产将是美国在诸如高清晰度电视和电子计算机等领域能否取得竞争优势的关键因素。
    按照计划，美国存储芯片有限公司将于今年底破土动工，1991年上半年正式投产，预计今后数年内将耗资10亿美元。其中一半资金由各成员公司分摊，另外一半依靠贷款。而关键技术则由国际商业机器公司提供。
    然而，这家联合公司眼下还面临一个法律问题，即是否违反美国的“反托拉斯法”。不过，迹象表明，政府将为它开放绿灯。商务部长对该公司的成立已表示欢迎。其他一些政府官员也早已表示赞成松动“反托拉斯法”，允许组成大型联合企业。
    由几家高技术产品制造公司组成一个庞大的联合企业，这在美国近几十年的历史上属首例。其目的显而易见，用《华尔街日报》援引一些外贸专家的话来说，就是为了“击退日本在技术领域的挑战”。国际商业机器公司总裁也声称，此举是为了“重新搞活美国的电子工业”。有人预料，如此先例获成功，其它行业也许会紧步后尘。看来，美国在高技术及其它贸易领域的竞争将会变换手法，企图摆脱困境，这是值得注意的新动向。
