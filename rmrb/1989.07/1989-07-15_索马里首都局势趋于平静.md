The situation in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, has calmed down after riots broke out yesterday. This morning, the situation has largely returned to normal.

Gunshots can still be heard sporadically in the city, but armored vehicles, military trucks, and fully armed soldiers deployed at key locations such as the presidential palace have been withdrawn.

Soldiers carrying submachine guns are still patrolling the streets, but traffic has resumed as usual.

The Somali National News Agency quoted a statement from the Ministry of the Interior saying that security forces, after being attacked with stones and bricks by rioters, killed 10 people and injured 32.

The statement said that an investigation into the riot is underway. Although the rioters disguised themselves as religious figures, the people should regard them as enemies of welfare and peace.

Riots broke out in the Somali capital today, with police clashing with rioters, resulting in 8 deaths and 24 injuries.

Some sources say that the riots occurred after the Somali government arrested several religious leaders on July 13. These leaders are suspected of involvement in the assassination of the Vatican representative to Somalia, Colombo, on July 9.

    新华社摩加迪沙7月14日电索马里首都今天发生骚乱，警察同骚乱分子发生的冲突中，有8人死亡，24人受伤。
