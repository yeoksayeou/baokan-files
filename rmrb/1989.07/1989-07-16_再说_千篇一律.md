	On "Uniformity" Once More
	Gù Mèngcháo

	My short article "On the Uniformity of Architecture" brought me great joy in seeing Mr. Xú Héngxuān's insightful analysis (see "Analysis of Uniformity" in the May 1, 1989, issue of the People's Daily, page 8). However, I feel he did not fully understand my intended meaning, so I would like to present another argument.

	To clarify, I will provide some more facts. The pioneer of the uniformity in modern architecture is the French modernist architect Le Corbusier. He famously said, "A house is a machine for living in." Last year (1987), the global architectural community solemnly commemorated the 100th anniversary of Le Corbusier's birth, reaffirming his contributions. Making houses as uniform as machines is perhaps his greatest contribution. In history, he was the first to prioritize housing, a critical issue for people, elevating it to the same level of importance as palaces and mausoleums, and seriously addressing it. This promoted the industrialization and standardization of housing, enabling large-scale, high-speed construction, and thus rapidly solving the housing problems of millions of homeless people. This must be acknowledged as a merit of "uniformity."

	Furthermore, Le Corbusier proposed five fundamental principles of modern architecture: 1. Place houses on freely arranged pillars, meaning people live above the second floor while the first floor is left open for public use and transportation; 2. Create roof gardens to compensate for the green space lost due to building construction; 3. Separate load-bearing columns from partition walls, making the layout of the house very flexible, allowing for both square and elongated spaces or even interconnected large spaces; 4. Use floor-to-ceiling windows to integrate indoor space with the outdoor landscape; 5. Design facades that can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. These five principles are widely applied in Le Corbusier's own residential designs and in modern architecture, and can also be described as "uniformity." This "uniformity" reflects humanity's understanding and application of the functions and design principles of housing. It must be said that many residential designs in our country have not yet reached this level of "uniformity." Of course, people, including Le Corbusier himself, are not satisfied with this uniformity. After all, houses are not machines but molds for living. When people's lifestyles change, housing should also change accordingly. For example, in the early days of liberation, the most pressing issue for the Chinese people was having a place to live. Therefore, a large number of "subsistence-type" houses appeared, and people were most concerned with whether they could fit another bed inside to solve the problem of having a place to sleep. Now, although urban housing is still a major issue, due to the improvement of people's living standards over the past decade, many people have begun to yearn for "comfortable-type" housing. They not only hope to have enough space to live but also hope to have a small hall, a balcony, clear functions for each room, and a room for receiving guests and family gatherings. Thus, houses with small halls or large rooms and small halls have become popular again. Once they become popular, they will inevitably become "uniform." This is unavoidable. Therefore, I believe that uniformity and diversity are two aspects of the same problem, and uniformity is the basic requirement and the essential aspect. If we do not understand and meet the basic common needs of tens of millions of people, but only focus on superficial appearances and pursue form, it may look lively, but many practical problems may not be solved. I am not against diversity, nor do I think that "industrial production can only produce uniform products." The argument is simply to emphasize that this "uniformity" is not to be feared and has many lovable aspects. Moreover, it is a level that we have not yet reached, so it is best not to hastily and uncritically reject it.

### 再说“千篇一律”

    再说“千篇一律”
    顾孟潮
    我的一篇短文《也谈建筑的千篇一律》，很高兴看到徐恒醇先生的一些解析的高见（见《人民日报》5月1日八版《千篇一律解析》），只是觉得他未能充分理解我的意思，不妨再呈一辩。
    为了解析，我不妨再贡献一点事实。现代建筑的千篇一律其始作俑者是法国现代建筑运动的大师勒·柯布西耶。他有句名言“房屋是居住的机器”。前年（1987年）全世界建筑界隆重地纪念了柯氏诞辰一百周年，重提他的贡献。让房屋像机器一样“千篇一律”恐怕应当说是其最大的贡献之一。在历史上，他首次把房荒、人民最关心的住宅问题提到首位，摆到像宫殿、陵墓的高度来认真解决，促进了房屋的工业化、标准化，更能大规模、高速度地建设，因而较快地解决了数以万计的无家可归者的居住问题。这不能不讲是“千篇一律”的功德。
    再讲，柯布西耶提出了现代建筑的五条原规：1、把房屋安排在自由布置的托柱上，即在二层以上住人，一层空出来以利公共使用和交通用；2、设屋顶花园，以弥补由于建房所占去的地面空间和绿化；3、让承重的柱子和分割空间的墙体脱离，使住宅的平面很自由，可方可长也可以是联通的大空间；4、使用落地的带形窗，使室内空间和室外风景环境融为一体；5、自由组合的立面，可以对称也可以不对称。这五条原则在柯布西耶自己的住宅设计中以及现代建筑中被广泛引用，也可以叫做“千篇一律”。而这种“千篇一律”体现了人类对住宅功能、设计规律的认识和运用。应当讲国内的许多住宅的设计还未达到这种“千篇一律”水平。当然，人们，包括柯布西耶本人并不满足于这种千篇一律，房屋毕竟不是机器而是生活的模具，当人们的生活方式变化后也应相应地发生变化。如解放初期，我国人民的突出问题是有无问题，因此大量“温饱型”住宅出现了，人们最关心的是房里多摆一张床，以解决住得下的问题。现在城市住房紧张仍是个大问题，但由于近十年来人民生活水平的提高，有许多人开始向往“小康型”住宅，不仅希望住得下，而且希望有个小厅，有个阳台，各房间功能明确，又有接待来客、合家欢聚的房间……于是带小方厅或大厅小室的住宅又流行起来。流行起来就要“千篇一律”，这是回避不了的。因此我认为，对千篇一律和多样化组成一个问题的两个方面，而且千篇一律是基本要求和本质的方面，如果连千百万人的基本共同要求都不了解，不去满足，而只顾搞花架子，追求形式，恐怕看起来挺热闹，许多实际问题不一定解决得了。我并非反对多样化，更不认为“工业化生产只能产生出千篇一律的产品”。论者只是想强调这种“千篇一律”并不可怕，尚有许多可爱之处，而且是至今我们尚未达到的高度，最好不要急急忙忙不加分析地否定掉。
