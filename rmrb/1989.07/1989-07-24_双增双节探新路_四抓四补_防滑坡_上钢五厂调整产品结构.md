In the first half of this year, due to rising raw material prices and other external factors, the economic performance of the Fifth Steel Plant of Shanghai Steel (Shanggang) has been declining, with profits dropping by 22.89% compared to the same period last year. To reverse this passive situation, Shanggang is striving to explore new paths for dual increase and dual reduction, starting with adjusting the product structure, and proposing a flexible strategy of "four grip, four compensate."

"Electric Furnace Loss, Converter Compensate." In the first half of the year, due to insufficient energy supply, electric furnace steel production decreased by over 40,000 tons, but the converter situation was good. They successfully produced high-quality steel using the converter, making up for the reduction in electric furnace production.

"High-Grade Steel Loss, Ordinary Steel Compensate." In the first half of the year, the production of high-grade steel decreased, while the production of ordinary steel increased. The strip mill produced 41,870 tons of ordinary steel strips, completing 57% of the annual plan. In the second half of the year, the monthly production of ordinary steel strips can reach over 7,000 tons. Thus, by leveraging the production capacity of ordinary steel, economic benefits will also be compensated.

"Profit Loss, Variety Compensate." Previously, Shanggang's economic benefits mainly relied on five high-profit products. Now, except for stainless steel, the other four varieties have been affected by external factors and have had to reduce production. However, the situation for stainless steel is very good. Currently, they are focusing on stainless steel production, aiming to make up for the losses caused by the reduction in other high-profit products.

"Steelmaking Loss, Processing Compensate." In the first half of the year, out of the 281,096 tons of steel produced, 7,816 tons were processed from raw materials. In the second half of the year, they will continue to explore new channels for processing raw materials, enhancing production capacity.

    双增双节探新路  “四抓四补”防滑坡
    上钢五厂调整产品结构
    本报上海7月24日电　记者章世鸿报道：今年上半年，由于原材料价格上涨及其它外部因素，上钢五厂经济效益不断滑坡，利润比去年同期下降22.89％。为扭转这种被动局面，上钢五厂力争探索双增双节的新路子，从调整产品结构着手，提出“四抓四补”的灵活对策。
    “电炉损失转炉补”。上半年，由于能源供应不足，电炉炼钢减少4万多吨，但转炉形势很好。他们利用转炉试生产优质钢材取得成功，弥补了电炉造成的减产。
    “优材损失普材补”。上半年优质钢生产下降，而普通钢生产上升。带钢分厂生产的普通钢带达41870吨，已完成全年计划57％，下半年月产量可达7000吨以上。这样，发挥普材的生产能力，在经济效益上也将得到补偿。
    “效益损失品种补”。以往上钢五厂的经济效益主要靠5个高利产品，现在，除不锈钢外，其它4个品种都受外界影响，被迫减产，但不锈钢形势大好。目前，他们重点抓不锈钢生产，力争弥补其它高利产品减产造成的损失。
    “炼钢损失加工补”。该厂上半年生产的281096吨钢材中，来料加工达7816吨。下半年还要继续开拓新的来料加工渠道，增强生产能力。
