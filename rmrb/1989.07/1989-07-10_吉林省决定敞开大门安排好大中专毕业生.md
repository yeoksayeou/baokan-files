Jilin Province Decides to Open Its Doors to Arrange for College and Vocational Graduates

Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 9th - (Reporter Chen Meifeng) “College graduates who are willing to work in Jilin Province are all warmly welcomed. We will adopt preferential policies and do everything possible to arrange for them.” This is what the reporter learned from the Jilin Provincial Government's executive meeting.

Relevant department heads in the province said that this year, Jilin Province will receive more than 26,000 college and vocational graduates, which is the highest number in history. However, compared to the needs of the province's economic construction and social development, it is still not enough. Therefore, Jilin Province will open its doors and take measures to attract more talents and seriously allocate and use talents.

The measures taken by the provincial government are:

	— All localities, departments, and units in the province must accept graduates according to the plan and properly arrange their work, study, and living conditions. No unit is allowed to return graduates who have been allocated according to the plan.

	— Graduates from subordinate colleges and universities who are allocated outside the plan, regardless of their place of residence, will be actively assisted in finding specific receiving units as long as they obey the allocation. Especially for graduates in urgently needed fields such as mechanical electronics, petroleum and chemical industry, metallurgy and power, light industry and food, electrical machinery, and civil engineering, they will be given priority in the province.

	— All public institutions in the province with vacant positions should try to accept and arrange college graduates. If some public institutions have full quotas, they can adopt the method of first accepting and then gradually adjusting to solve the problem.

	— The number of college and vocational graduates accepted by enterprise units in the province should be included in the enterprise contract and target management assessment. Enterprises accepting college and vocational graduates are not subject to staffing limits.

	— Graduates who work in collective enterprises and township enterprises in the province will retain their public sector employee status, and their salaries can be adjusted upwards by the enterprises. Those who reside in cities can retain their urban grain ration relationship.

	— Graduates who are approved by the state to implement the "two-way choice" allocation system, the relevant departments or regional planning departments should not set up barriers and should provide support and handle relevant procedures.

    吉林省决定敞开大门安排好大中专毕业生
    新华社长春7月9日电　（记者陈美凤）“大学毕业生只要愿意到吉林省工作，我们都热情欢迎，并采取优惠政策，千方百计安排好”。这是记者从吉林省政府常务会议上获悉的。
    省有关部门负责人说，今年吉林省将接收2.6万余名大中专毕业生，虽然是历史上最多的一年，但与全省经济建设和社会发展的需要相比，仍然不相适应。因此，吉林省要敞开大门采取措施，多吸引一些人才，认真分配、使用好人才。
    省政府采取的措施是：
    ——全省各地、各部门及用人单位一定要按计划接收毕业生，妥善地安排好他们的工作、学习和生活。任何单位都不准退回按计划分配的毕业生。
    ——计划外分配到吉林的部属院校毕业生，无论家居何地，只要服从分配，都要积极协助落实具体接收单位。特别是急需的机械电子、石油化工、冶金动力、轻工食品、电机电器、土木建筑等科类的毕业生，在全省范围内给予优先安排。
    ——省内空编的所有事业单位，都要尽量接收安排高校毕业生。个别事业单位若编制满额，可采取先接收下来，然后再逐步调整的办法解决。
    ——省内企业单位接收大中专毕业生的数量，要列为企业承包和目标管理的考核内容之一。企业接收大中专毕业生，不受定员限制。
    ——凡到省内集体企业、乡镇企业工作的毕业生，保留全民干部身份，工资可由企业自行向上浮动。家居城市的，可保留城市户粮关系。
    ——经国家批准，实行“双向选择”分配的毕业生，各主管部门或地区计划调配部门，不准设卡，要给予支持，办理有关手续。
