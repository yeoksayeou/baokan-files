    古巴免除七名将军职务
    新华社哈瓦那7月14日电  古巴近日更换了包括前内政部副部长在内7名将军的职务。
    据古巴官方的《格拉玛报》今天透露，政府已任命原东部地区陆军参谋长、古共中央候补委员罗马里科·索托马约尔中将接替帕斯夸尔·马丁内斯中将的内政部副部长职务，前革命武装部情报局长贝穆德斯·库蒂诺中将接任巴雷罗·卡拉梅斯中将的内政部情报局长职务。近日被接受辞职的还有原边防局长、消防局长、移民局长和内政部政治部门的两名要员。古巴官方未透露这5名少将衔军官辞职的原因。
    今年6月29日，前内政部长何塞·阿夫兰特由于严重失职被解除职务。
    7月7日以古巴前陆军中将奥乔亚为首的14名军官因参与贩毒被古特别军事法庭判处死刑或有期徒刑，其中数人曾在内政部担任重要职务。
