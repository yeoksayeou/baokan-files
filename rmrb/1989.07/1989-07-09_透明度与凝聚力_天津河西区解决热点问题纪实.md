In early June, amidst the chaos, the Tianjin Hexi District government faced a multitude of thorny issues: the number of children enrolling in primary schools increased by 7,550 compared to the previous year. Each child tugs at the hearts of several adults, and everyone hopes to enroll in a "key school." The renovation of Nansi Lou Chaopu was completed, and 426 households were waiting to see the list of relocation assignments, all with eyes wide open, watching for any signs of favoritism. Some even threatened, "If it's not fair, we'll bring our children to the school to sit in protest, and go to the district office to petition!"

The district government is the primary department responsible for arranging people's lives. Eating, drinking, using the toilet, sleeping, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, tea, sewage overflow, picking locks... everything is urgent and complex. Issues involving children, housing, money, positions, and vegetable baskets are particularly under the spotlight.

District Chief Liu Fengyan's stance is clear: "As always, we need transparency, integrity, and meticulous work."

For primary school admissions, the process is open and transparent: open enrollment by district, open examinations, and open admissions. Any child who meets the criteria for nearby enrollment and falls within the key school's district will be admitted. At the same time, supervisory personnel from the district's supervision bureau and community representatives selected by the district's residents conduct dual supervision. District leaders visit the scene and engage in face-to-face dialogues with the community, listening to complaints.

Problems are numerous and varied. "Why does someone who originally had one room get assigned two?" "Why does the agreement say 17 square meters, but I only got 13 square meters?" Investigations revealed that in the first case, the household's unit trade union had allocated an additional room from elsewhere. In the second case, the living area was mistakenly written as the building area... all doubts were cleared one by one.

Who is clean and who is corrupt, the people can see clearly. A vice district chief in charge of housing allocation, with his grown son and daughter crammed into a narrow room, did not seek any personal gain and was praised by the people. Meanwhile, a deputy director of the district's housing management bureau was detained for accepting bribes and engaging in private dealings. Examples are multifaceted. Through these examples, people not only see the difficulty of implementing clean governance but also see the hope!

"Riots must be firmly suppressed, and reflections must be conducted deeply. Why do so many people have complaints about us? In matters that affect the people's immediate interests, we must be open and fair, without any ambiguity!" A district official told the reporter. This district also implements a set of open governance and community supervision methods for price work, hiring officials, and salary adjustments.

Increased transparency in governance has boosted citizens' trust in the government. One incident is particularly convincing: the reconstruction and relocation of Da Gu Nan Road in this district involved 813 households, but within 36 hours, all residents had happily moved out. This incident, dubbed a miracle by the mayor of Tianjin, highlights two golden words: trust!

    透明度与凝聚力
    ——天津河西区解决热点问题纪实
    本报记者　肖荻
    6月初，乱云飞渡，天津市河西区政府也面临着一大堆棘手的问题：小学入学人数比去年增加7550人。一个孩子牵动好几个大人的心，人人希望进“重点校”。南楼蒿铺改建竣工，426户人家等候张榜迁居，也都瞪大眼睛看着有无厚此薄彼。有人还扬言：
  “不公平，就带孩子到学校静坐，到区里上访！”
    区政府是安排人民生活的主管部门。吃、喝、拉、撒、睡，油、盐、酱、醋、茶，污水外溢，拧门撬锁……千头万绪，急如星火。涉及孩子、房子、票子、位子、菜篮子的事，更是众目所瞩。
    区长刘峰岩观点很明确：“一如既往，要透明度，要廉政，要过细做工作。”
    小学招生，公开划片，公开考试，公开录取。凡符合就近入学原则，划在重点校范围的适龄儿童，够招生条件者一律录取。与此同时，由区监察局等专业监督人员和地区群众推选的廉政监督员，前往实行双重监督。区领导到现场和群众当面对话，听取举报。
    问题杂然纷陈。“为什么有的原来一间房，却分给他两间？”“为什么协议书上是17平方米，分房时却给我13平方米？”经查，前者是户主单位的工会从别处调剂的一间房，后者是将居住平米错写成建筑平米……疑团逐一解开。
    谁廉谁贪，群众看得清楚。管分房的一位副区长，大儿大女挤住在狭窄的里外间，不捞什么“好处”受到人们称赞。而区房管局办公室一位副主任，受贿营私，终究被依法拘留。典型是多方面的。通过典型，人们不仅看到了实行廉政的艰巨性，也看到了实行廉政的希望！
    “暴乱要坚决平息，反思也要深刻进行。为什么那么多人对我们有意见？在涉及群众切身利益的事情上要公开、要公道，一点不能含糊！”这个区的负责人对记者说。这个区在物价工作、聘用干部、提级调资等热点问题上同样也贯彻一整套办事公开、群众监督的办法。
    施政的透明度增加了市民对政府的信任度。有件事很有说服力，这个区大沽南路的改建拆迁，涉及813户居民，但仅用36小时，全部住户就高高兴兴地搬迁完了。被天津市长称为奇迹的这件事情凸现出两个金色的字：信任！
