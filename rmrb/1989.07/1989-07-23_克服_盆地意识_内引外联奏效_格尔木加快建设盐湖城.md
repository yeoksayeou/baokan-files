People's Daily, Xining, July 23rd.

The city of Golmud in Qinghai Province is breaking away from the "basin mentality" and accelerating its internal and external opening-up steps. In the past year, it has attracted 150 million yuan in funds from both domestic and foreign sources, developing a series of resource-processing enterprises such as potassium, magnesium, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. This has given the salt lake city, situated at an altitude of 2800 meters, a new look.

Golmud is located on the southern edge of the Qaidam Basin. Within its borders lies the world-famous Chahar Lake, a crucial junction for the Qinghai-Tibet, Qinghai-Xinjiang, and Dunhuang-Golmud highways, as well as the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. Since its reestablishment as a city in 1980, it has developed 23 enterprises in electricity, salt chemicals, machinery, and food salt, while also supporting the construction of key national enterprises such as the Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Plant. To accelerate resource development, from August last year to April this year, the municipal government sent out three economic delegations. Using more preferential and flexible methods than those in inland areas, they encouraged external investments.

Among the funds attracted, Hong Kong's Kam Lung Limited and Australia's Huang Limited account for 90 million yuan. Recently, agreements have been reached for joint ventures to produce 20,000 tons of caustic soda and 10,000 tons of sodium aluminate.

    克服“盆地意识”　内引外联奏效
    格尔木加快建设盐湖城
    本报西宁7月23日电　记者郅振璞、张铭清报道：青海省格尔木市打破“盆地意识”，加快对内对外开放步伐。近一年来，从国内外引进资金1.5亿元，发展一批钾镁、硫酸、烧碱等资源加工型企业，使这座海拔2800米的盐湖城再展新姿。
    格尔木位于柴达木盆地南缘，境内有闻名世界的察尔汗盐湖，是青藏、青新、敦格三条公路干线和青藏铁路交汇处。1980年重新建市以来，已发展电力、盐化、机械、食盐等企业23个，同时支援了青海钾肥厂等国家重点企业的建设。为了加快资源开发，去年8月至今年4月，市政府先后派出3个经济代表团，采用比内地更优惠、更灵活的办法激励外界投资。
    引进的这批资金中，香港金龙有限公司、澳大利亚黄氏有限公司两家占9000万元，日前已达成2万吨烧碱、1万吨红矾钠的合资企业协议。
