The State Bureau of Technical Supervision has recently issued three national standards: "National Office Document Format," "Draft Paper Format for Issued Documents," and "Archival File Format for Documents." The implementation of these three national standards will affect more than 6 million units across various departments and regions, including party, government, military, mass organizations, factories, mines, enterprises, and public institutions.

To unify the format of national office documents across the country and standardize them as national standards is a necessity for achieving office automation. The issuance and implementation of these three standards will establish a standardized format system for office documents from drafting, issuing, to filing and managing documents, which will improve the quality and efficiency of office work. This will also facilitate the exchange of documents domestically and internationally, promoting information exchange. Additionally, it will avoid the waste caused by different paper sizes, saving office expenses.

The national standards "National Office Document Format" and "Archival File Format for Documents" have been implemented since March 1, 1989, and have been published by the China Standards Press. The national standard "Draft Paper Format for Issued Documents" will be officially implemented on September 1, 1989, and will be published soon. The State Bureau of Technical Supervision hopes that all levels of national offices, both central and local, will organize the implementation of these three national standards seriously and strictly follow the standards for handling documents. Other enterprises, public institutions, and organizations should also refer to these three national standards for handling documents to achieve nationwide uniformity.

    技术监督局发布三项国家标准
    国家机关公文将统一格式
    本报讯　记者朱剑红报道：为了改变国家机关公文混乱局面，逐步实现办公自动化，国家技术监督局新近发布了《国家机关公文格式》、《发文稿纸格式》和《文书档案案卷格式》。这三个国家标准的实施将涉及我国各部门、各地区的党政军机关、群众团体、厂矿企业、事业单位等600万个以上。
    将国家机关的公文格式在全国范围内统一起来，以国家标准的形式予以规范化，是实现办公自动化的需要。这三项标准的发布和实施，将使机关公文从起草、行文到文件的归档管理初步形成一套标准化格式体系，有利于提高机关的工作质量和办公效率，有利于国内外的文件交换，促进信息交流。同时，还能避免由于各种纸张尺寸不一造成的浪费，节约办公经费。
    《国家机关公文格式》和《文书档案案卷格式》两个国家标准已于今年3月1日实施，并已由中国标准出版社出版发行。《发文稿纸格式》国家标准将于9月1日正式实施，并即将出版。国家技术监督局表示，希望中央和地方各级国家机关认真组织好这三个国家标准的实施工作，严格按标准的规定处理公文。各企业事业及其他团体的办公机关，也应参照这三个国家标准处理公文，以实现全国范围内的统一。
