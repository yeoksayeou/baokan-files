People's Daily reports: For disabled individuals seeking to make a living and prosper, a hand-cranked knitting machine can be a great assistant. Recently, a demonstration in Beijing showcased this popular knitting equipment, which was developed domestically for the first time by the Yiyang Sewing Machine Factory in Hunan. This machine does not consume energy and can be operated on a table or stool, capable of knitting hundreds of patterns using various types of yarn.

The factory, in collaboration with the Beijing Disabled Persons' Federation, organized training classes, enabling dozens of disabled individuals to support themselves through knitting. The Deaf-Mute School in Nanping, Fujian Province, also uses this knitting machine for teaching, cultivating a group of skilled knitters.

    手动编织机造福残疾人
    本报讯　残疾人欲谋生致富，手动毛衣编织机是个好帮手。日前在北京展示的这种普及型编织设备，由湖南益阳缝纫机厂在国内首家开发成功。它不耗能源，摆放在桌凳上即可操作，能用多种线料编出数百种花样。
    这家厂同北京市残疾人协会联合举办培训班，使数十名残疾人靠编织自食其力。福建南平市聋哑学校运用这种编织机授课，培养出一批编织能手。
