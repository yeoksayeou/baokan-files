Every time I think of the two male citizens I encountered on the street and a short-haired girl from Japan, my emotions surge and I am filled with countless reflections.

On the morning of June 4, I was returning home after visiting a close friend. As I walked past a crossroads by the Haihe River, the sky was clear and blue, and my restless heart finally relaxed. Suddenly, a small group of people carrying wreaths walked towards me from the west. A crowd gathered to watch, and I immediately stopped. A young man with long hair stepped forward with a megaphone, speaking loudly about how the "People's Liberation Army had massacred Tiananmen Square," how "blood flowed like rivers, with over twenty thousand casualties, and the gunshots were still echoing..."

A middle-aged man suddenly stood up. He appeared to be over sixty, dressed modestly, with a round, dark, and thin face full of the wrinkles of a hardworking person. He politely walked up to the young man and asked seriously:

"Little brother, where did you hear such frightening news? Is it true? Is it reliable? If it's not true and reliable, you can't just spread rumors. You have to take responsibility!"

"Have you listened to _Voice of America_? ... Are you Chinese?" A man in his fifties from the crowd suddenly interjected, his tone sharp as if he were a judge.

The modestly dressed old man seemed to have never imagined he would hear such strange logic. He was taken aback, wanting to laugh but not able to. He quickly turned to face the man who had questioned him like a judge, ready to counter. "Let's go, let's go, why bother with this?" Two middle-aged workers said, pulling him away.

I suddenly remembered: he might be Jiang Daqian.

After Tianjin was liberated, I was part of a work team sent by the Municipal Military Control Commission to his factory. In just a week, I knew his name. I affectionately called him Jiang Daqian, and a playful comrade immediately corrected me: "The 'da' in his name has a dot under it, call him Daqian." He joined the factory's choir. Every time I taught a song, he was the first to arrive. He always swept the floor of the workers' clubhouse until it was spotless and arranged the chairs neatly. When I taught the song "We Workers Have Power," his voice was not good, but he sang with great sincerity and emotion. Every three months, the workshop elected hygiene champions and production efficiency models, and his name was always at the top of the list.

His factory was far from where I lived, and I didn't often go to Tianjin, so after we shook hands and said goodbye, I never saw him again. This January, I returned to Tianjin from another province and decided to write a short article for the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. I went to his factory for an interview, and someone told me he had retired. They also told me that he didn't involve himself in household affairs at home but led a team of retired workers to maintain public order in the neighborhood. He didn't ask the neighborhood committee for any payment and patrolled the streets with a red armband every day. He had caught five thieves, making the neighborhood a famous peaceful place in the entire district.

On June 25, I decided to visit Jiang Daqian to confirm if the old man scolded on June 4 was him. Unfortunately, my granddaughter got lost while shopping with my wife. I quickly reported it to the police and searched everywhere. In the evening, when I returned home, my granddaughter jumped into my arms, and I was overjoyed as if I had found a lost treasure. I eagerly asked my wife where she found her. My wife, tears in her eyes, said a man had brought her back. I asked, "Where is the man?" My wife replied, "It's all my fault. I gave him a watermelon and 100 yuan as a reward, and he left as soon as he saw the money. I chased after him a few steps and asked his name. He said to greet you for me. He looked about sixty, with no white hair, and was dressed like a retired worker."

It's him, it must be him! I exclaimed in delight.

The next day, a little after 8 AM, I happily took a bus to visit Jiang Daqian. A young woman sat next to me. She was dressed simply but elegantly, with short, black, and shiny hair, a fair and smooth face, and a pair of pure eyes that shone with warmth and friendliness. I couldn't help but start a conversation, asking her where she was going. She said she was from Japan and was studying at a university in Beijing, coming to Tianjin for a visit during her holiday. She happily told me her name was Kawayama Sachiko. As a citizen of Tianjin, I immediately welcomed her warmly and said:

"Kawayama Sachiko, I initially thought you were a Chinese girl."

She smiled sweetly: "I'm glad you thought I was a Chinese girl. The mountains and rivers of China are beautiful, and the Chinese people are very friendly. I already consider your great country my second home. Really!"

I couldn't help but reach out to shake her hand, but suddenly the bus jolted, and I leaned forward to look. A strange, gloomy face appeared in my view, and I widened my eyes. He was sitting in the third row, facing the Japanese girl, with his mouth turned down in a disdainful smile. He was the man who had questioned and scolded Jiang Daqian on June 4 with the tone of a judge. He had heard the Japanese girl's response to me, and his gaze was almost the same as when he had questioned and scolded Jiang Daqian.

The bus quickly stopped near the Haihe Park, and the Japanese girl got off to sightsee. I no longer saw that strange, gloomy face. As the bus drove along the park, the scenery was as beautiful as a painting, with flowers blooming in clusters and rows, red, white, yellow, blue... all vying for attention, each emitting their fragrance, like being in a fairyland. After three more stops, I would get off to see the Jiang Daqian I was eager to meet, but my heart was not entirely filled with joy. I didn't know what was constantly polluting my good mood...

    邂逅海河边
    杨润身
    每当我想起在街上遇见过的两位男性公民，和日本的一位短发姑娘，就心潮起伏，感慨万千。
    6月4日上午，我往一位挚友家串门返家，走过海河边的一个十字路口，蓝天如洗，我多日不宁静的心松缓下来。忽然，从西边马路上走来一支人数不多、举着花圈的队伍。一群人站下来围观，我也立即止步。一位头留长发的年轻人提着话筒气昂昂地走出队伍演讲，说什么“解放军血洗天安门”，“血流成河，伤亡两万余，枪声还在响着……”一位男性公民突然站立下来，他像是年过花甲，衣着普通，圆圆的、黑黑的、瘦瘦的面颊上布满勤劳的人才有的那种皱纹。他谦和地走到年轻人面前，郑重地问：
    “小兄弟，你从哪儿听来的这吓人的消息？真实吗？可靠吗？不真实不可靠可不能瞎说八道呀，要负责任的！……”
    “你听《美国之音》了吗？……你是中国人吗？”人群里一位50岁左右的男性公民代拿话筒的年轻人突然接腔。口气之凌厉，俨如审判官。
    衣着普通的老人像是做梦也想不到会听到如此奇特的逻辑，他惊愕得想笑未笑，他瞬间朝以审判官口气审问他的男性公民扭过脸来，正欲反诘。“走吧，走吧，争这口气干吗？！”两个衣着普通的中年工人说着将他架走了。
    我忽然想起：他有可能是姜大君。
    天津市解放以后，我作为市军管会派出的工作组的一个组员，进驻到了他所在的工厂里。不过一周，我就知道了他的名字，我亲切地喊他姜大君，一个爱开玩笑的师傅立即纠正我：“他的大字下边还有一点儿，叫他太君。”他参加了厂里的歌咏队。我每次教歌，数他到得早。他每次都要把工人俱乐部屋里难以清扫洁净的地面清扫洁净，再将一个个凳子摆弄整齐。我教唱《咱们工人有力量》，他的音色不佳，却唱得极认真，极带感情。车间三个月选举一次卫生标兵和增产节约模范，他名下的“正”字最多。
    他所在的厂址离我居住的地方甚远，我又不常在天津，与他握手告别之后就没有再见着他。今年1月，我从外地返回天津，准备写篇迎接建国40周年的短文，我往他所在的工厂采访，人告诉我说他已经退休，又告诉我说他在家里不过问家事，带头在街道里建起退休工人维护治安小分队。他不向街委会索要分文报酬，整天带着红箍四处巡逻。他抓过五个小偷，使街道成了闻名全区的太平世界。
    6月25日，我决定朝姜大君家奔一趟，弄清6月4日上午遭人斥责的老人是不是他。偏巧我的小孙女让老伴领着逛市场给丢失了。我慌忙报警，四处寻找。傍晚回到家里，小孙女跳跃着扑到我怀里，我惊喜得如失去的无价之宝又回到怀里，紧问老伴从哪里找到？老伴含泪说是人给送来的。我问：“人呢？”老伴答：“都怪我，给人切了西瓜，又给人拿出100元酬谢金，人一见钞票甩袖而去，我紧赶几步，问他姓名，他说他叫我向你问好。我看他60岁出头，还没有白发，粗墩墩的穿扮像是个退休工人。”
    是他，肯定是他！我惊喜地大声喊。
    第二天，8点过后，我愉快地乘公共汽车西去拜会姜大君，同一位姑娘坐在一起。姑娘衣服素雅，款式大方，乌黑光洁的短发，白净细润的脸庞，一双泉水般纯净的眼睛里朝我闪射着温情友好的目光。我不由得与她搭讪，问她到哪里去？她说她是从日本来中国北京一个大学学习的，是自费来学习的，乘假日从北京来天津玩玩。她又愉快地告诉我说她的名字叫川山幸子。作为天津市一个市民的我立即对她表示热忱的欢迎，并说：
    “川山幸子，我开始还把您看成中国姑娘了。”
    她嫣然一笑：“我很高兴您把我看成中国姑娘。中国的山水非常美丽，中国父老兄弟姐妹非常友好，我已经把您的伟大的祖国看成我的第二故乡了。真的！”
    我抑制不住地要朝她伸出我的炽热的手，忽然咕咚一声，汽车颠簸起来，我忙朝前探视，一张古怪阴沉的脸撞入我的眼帘，我不由得睁大眼睛。他坐在前三排的一个座位上，面朝着日本姑娘，口角向下沉着，作出厌弃的笑。他是6月4日以审判官口气质问训斥姜大君的那位男性公民。他听见了日本姑娘对我的表答，那目光，和质问训斥姜大君时几乎一样。
    汽车很快在靠近海河公园的站前停立下来，日本姑娘下车游玩，我也再看不到那张古怪阴沉的面孔。车开后，贴着海河公园行驶，风景如画一样优美，鲜花盛开着，一丛丛，一行行，红的、白的、黄的、蓝的……相互争艳，各吐芬芳，似入仙境，再走三站，我就该下车见到我急于见到的姜大君了，而我的心内不尽是快感，不知是何物在不断污染我的美好的心境……
