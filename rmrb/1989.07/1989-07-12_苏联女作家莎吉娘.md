Marietta Sergeyevna Shaginyan (1888–1982) was a prominent poet and outstanding writer of the older generation in the Soviet Union. She began her literary career in the early 20th century, publishing her first poems in newspapers in 1903. In 1909, she published her first poetry collection, *The First Meeting*, which reflected the contradictions in her thoughts: the mysticism and abstraction of symbolism, contemplation of life, personal loneliness, and vague dreams, as well as spiritual excitement. In 1913, she published a new poetry collection, *Eastern Motifs*, which dealt with themes of pure love and maternal affection in the world, serving as a reaction to the self-expression of emotions and thoughts in *The First Meeting*. Shaginyan's poems are rich in symbolic associations and metaphors, with unique and innovative artistic techniques, harmonious rhythms, elegant language, fresh tones, and tender, lingering emotions. Her lyrical talent is most perfectly expressed in her vivid descriptions of the Russian natural world and in her delicate expressions of love. However, at times, she deliberately pursues fleeting illusions and transient thoughts, making her language obscure and her moods gloomy.

Starting in the 1920s, Shaginyan primarily wrote novels, with notable works including *The Story of My Life*, *Transformation*, *The Adventures of a Lady*, *The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station*, *Ural in Defense*, and the *Lenin Quartet*. *The Dnieper Hydroelectric Station* not only depicts socialist construction but also reveals new relationships between people, deeply reflecting real life. It is one of the exemplary works of "production themes" in Soviet literature. Shaginyan was also one of the earliest writers to explore the theme of Lenin. She spent nearly 50 years working on her magnum opus, the *Lenin Quartet*, which includes the novels *The Ulyanov Family* (1938) and *The First All-Russian Exhibition* (1965), the novel outline *The Test of History* (1969), and the essay collection *The Lenin Quartet* (1972). She continuously revised these works. Such a monumental work is extremely rare in biographies of great men. To honor her contributions and achievements in this field, her *Lenin Quartet* won the Lenin Prize in 1972, making her one of the first female writers to receive the Lenin Prize. Her final work was the memoir *Man and Time* (4 volumes, 1975). In 1976, she was awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor of the Soviet Union.

Shaginyan was a controversial figure in the Soviet literary world, but her works were widely loved and welcomed by readers both domestically and internationally. After her death, her obituary praised her works as being "closely connected with the life of the Soviet state and the great creative labor of the Soviet people," describing her as an "active researcher and chronicler of Soviet history." It also noted that she "inherited the tradition of Gorky, dedicating all her talent as an artist and publicist to the struggle for building a new life."

    苏联女作家莎吉娘
    黎华
    玛丽埃塔·谢尔盖耶芙娜·莎吉娘（1888—1982），苏联老一代的杰出诗人和优秀作家。20世纪初期她就开始文学创作活动，1903年在报刊发表最初的诗作。1909年出版第一部具有象征主义色彩的诗集《初会》，这本处女作反映了诗人思想发展的矛盾：象征主义的神秘性和抽象性，对人生的沉思，自身的孤独和朦胧的梦境，彼土的精神的激奋。1913年出版了震惊文坛的新诗集《东方风情》，描写的主题乃人世间纯真的爱情和母性的慈爱，是《初会》中自我表现的心绪、感情和思想的一个反动。莎吉娘的诗篇富有象征主义的联想和比喻，艺术手法别致、新颖，音韵和谐，文词绚丽，格调清新，婉约缠绵，其抒情天赋最完美地表现在对俄罗斯自然界的动人描写中，表现在细腻的爱情的抒泄中，但有时着意追求瞬间的幻觉、飘忽的意念，语言晦涩，情调低沉。
    从20年代起，莎吉娘主要写作小说，名著有《我一生的遭遇》、《转变》、《官太太奇遇》、《中央水电站》、《防卫中的乌拉尔》以及《列宁四部曲》等。《中央水电站》在描写社会主义建设的同时揭示了人与人之间的新关系，深刻地反映了现实生活，是苏联文学中“生产题材”的典范作品之一。莎吉娘又是最早探索列宁题材的老作家之一，她花了近50年时间从事她的力作《列宁四部曲》，包括长篇小说《乌里扬诺夫一家》（1938）和《第一届全俄博览会》（1965）、小说大纲《历史的考验》（1969）、特写集《列宁四部曲》（1972），并曾不断修改，这样的巨作是伟人传记中极罕见的。为表彰她在这一领域的贡献和成就，她的《列宁四部曲》获得1972年列宁奖金，她成了最早获列宁奖金的女作家。她的最后一部著作是回忆录《人与时间》（4卷，1975）。1976年她荣获苏联社会主义劳动英雄称号。
    莎吉娘在苏联文学界曾是位有争议的作家，但她的作品颇受国内外读者的广泛喜爱和欢迎。她逝世后，讣告称誉她的“作品同苏维埃国家的生活和苏联人民伟大的创造性劳动紧密相连，是苏维埃史实积极的研究者和编年史的编纂者”，她“继承了高尔基的传统，将她艺术家和政论家的全部天才献给了建立新生活的斗争”。
