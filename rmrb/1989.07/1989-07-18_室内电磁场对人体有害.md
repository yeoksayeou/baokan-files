West German scientists believe that indoor electromagnetic fields can have harmful effects on human health.

According to the West German "Sunday World News," all electrical appliances and wires emit electromagnetic waves of varying intensities and wavelengths, creating electromagnetic fields around them. These electromagnetic fields can cause headaches, morning fatigue, irritability, insomnia, lack of concentration, or depression. The Bavarian Building Biology Research Institute recently surveyed 2,000 households and found that when the electromagnetic fields were weakened or completely eliminated, the aforementioned symptoms in people also disappeared within a few days.

Scientists conducted a series of experiments on the effects of electromagnetic fields and found that they can affect hormones that are crucial for the human biological clock and hormones that transmit neural information; they can affect genetic cell substances; and they can damage cell membranes.

For this reason, experts suggest the following: after an electric blanket warms up, the power should be turned off; alarm clocks that use alternating current should be placed as far from the bed as possible; the distance between a person and a television should be maintained at 4-5 meters, and the distance from fluorescent tubes containing luminescent materials should be maintained at 2-3 meters; the electromagnetic field strength in workspaces and bedrooms should be measured, and if the strength is too high, measures should be taken.

    室内电磁场对人体有害
    新华社波恩7月17日电  西德科学家认为，室内电磁场会对人体健康产生有害影响。
    据西德《星期日世界报》报道，所有电器和导线都放射出不同强度和波长的电磁波，并在其周围形成电磁场。这种电磁场会使人头痛、早上疲乏、神经质、睡眠不安、精神不集中或消沉。巴伐利亚建筑生物研究所近来对2000套住宅进行调查，结果表明，当电磁场减弱或完全消除，人的上述症状在几天内也随之消失。
    科学家们对电磁场的影响做了一系列试验，得出的结果是，电磁场会影响对人体生物钟起重要作用的激素和传递神经信息的激素；会影响遗传体细胞质素；会破坏细胞膜。
    为此专家们建议：当电热毯变暖后应切断电源；使用交流电的电闹钟应尽量离床远一点；人与彩电之间的距离应保持4—5米，离含有发光物质的灯管的距离应保持2—3米；应测量工作间和卧室的电磁场强度，如强度过高，就采取措施。
