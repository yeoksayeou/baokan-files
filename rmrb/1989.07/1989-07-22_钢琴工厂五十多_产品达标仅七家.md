The Ministry of Light Industry recently released the results of a nationwide instrument quality inspection, which showed that among the 16 piano factories in China with mass production capabilities, only 7 have products that meet the standards.

The National Instrument Quality Supervision and Inspection Center conducted the piano inspections according to international standards. The inspection items included pitch stability, sound quality, timbre, volume, craftsmanship, assembly, playability, appearance, coating, and metal parts. The products from the four major brands in Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Yingkou—Xinghai, Zhujiang, Nie Er, and Xingfu—have some indicators that meet the B-level standard, which is the general international level. However, most indicators only reach the C-level, and some are even at the D-level, which is the general and usable standard. Using the usable standard, the Ministry of Light Industry recommends to consumers that only 7 factories nationwide meet the criteria.

A few years ago, driven by the "piano boom" in the consumer market, some regions, regardless of conditions, rushed to establish piano factories. As of now, there are more than 50 piano production factories and points nationwide. However, there are very few factories that have the conditions to produce qualified products, and even fewer that can achieve mass production.

    钢琴工厂五十多  产品达标仅七家
    本报讯  记者刘桂莲报道：轻工部最近公布的全国乐器质量检测结果表明，我国已形成批量生产能力的16家钢琴厂，其产品质量达标的只有7家。
    全国乐器质量监督检测中心按照国际标准，对钢琴检测的项目包括音准稳定性、音质音色音量、工艺装配及弹奏性能、外观涂饰、金属零件等。北京、广州、上海、营口四大名牌厂家生产的星海、珠江、聂耳、幸福牌钢琴，除少数指标达到B级水平，也就是国际一般水平，多数指标只达到C级，有的还是D级，也就是国际一般水平和可用标准。以可用为标准，轻工部推荐给消费者购买的，全国只有7家。
    前几年，在消费市场“钢琴热”的驱动下，一些地区不顾条件，钢琴厂一哄而上。截至目前，全国已有五十多家钢琴生产厂、点，但真正有条件能生产出合格产品的厂家不多，达到批量生产的就更少。
