China has achieved decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. Following the government's series of resolute measures, the situation in the capital and across the country has quickly stabilized. Over the past month, social order has gradually returned to normal, and people's production and work have resumed. The truth about the riots in Beijing and the process of suppressing them has been revealed to the world. More and more people in the international community understand the measures taken by the Chinese government to handle this incident. Many enlightened individuals in various countries appreciate China's repeated affirmation that the policy of reform and opening up remains unchanged and have taken a realistic and wise attitude. They emphasize the importance of cherishing the long-standing friendly cooperative relations with China, believing that continuing to develop relations with China is crucial for the peace, stability, and prosperity of East Asia and the world.

Unfortunately, the recent summit of the seven Western countries in Paris continues to ignore the actual situation in China, acting as judges based on their so-called "values" to pass judgment on China's affairs. In their political declaration, they criticized China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots, "condemning" what they call "China's violent suppression of human rights." The criticism from the summit of the seven Western countries is groundless and is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs. The Chinese government and people naturally cannot accept this.

The facts have shown that the riots in Beijing were instigated by a few conspirators in collusion with hostile foreign forces, who used the student movement to plan and organize, imposing it on us. Their goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert our socialist system. The riots in Beijing lasted for a long time, affected a wide area, caused severe damage, were full of malicious plots, and used brutal methods. This is rare in the history of our country since its founding and is also rare in the world. At a critical moment when the People's Republic of China faced a threat to its existence, the Chinese government had no choice but to take swift and decisive action to suppress the riots and turn the situation from danger to safety. The Chinese government took action in the best interests of the Chinese people under extremely complex and difficult conditions.

The truth of the matter is not difficult to understand. However, due to the media in some Western countries, especially the media in the United States, which have exaggerated and distorted the facts about China's suppression of the riots, the "rumor company" has stirred up trouble, fearing that the world would not be chaotic enough, causing Westerners to form completely wrong and distorted impressions. Some government officials in certain Western countries also refuse to sit down calmly and listen to the facts provided by the Chinese side, sticking to their own views, confined to Western values, and constantly criticizing and sanctioning China, interfering in China's internal affairs at will. This practice violates international law. If, in international relations, one does not objectively and impartially understand the right and wrong of a matter, but instead makes policies based on distorted media propaganda, erroneous intelligence, or even absurd rumors, this is not only extremely irresponsible but also very dangerous.

This summit of the seven countries continues to put pressure on China, attempting to force China to abandon this just struggle against riots and subversion. It should be pointed out that the actions taken by the Chinese government have not harmed the West or any other country. The problem is that some countries, based on their likes and values, have, in words and actions, directly harmed China's interests and dignity over a wide range. Any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs is in vain. The Chinese government and people will never yield to any form of pressure from any country; instead, it will only inspire the Chinese people's spirit of hard work and self-reliance, making the country's construction even better. At the same time, we must reiterate: now, after the decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots, the Chinese government and people will not change the basic policy of reform and opening up due to the unfriendly actions of certain countries. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently clearly pointed out that the policy of adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, as decided by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, must be firmly carried out. The practice of the past decade has proven that this policy is the foundation of our state and the path to a strong country. It has brought unprecedented benefits to the Chinese people and has also strengthened economic exchanges between China and other countries, promoting the prosperity and stability of the world.

Currently, more and more people in the international community believe that China's policy of reform and opening up has not changed after suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots. They hope to continue maintaining and developing economic and trade relations with China and oppose the wrong practice of excluding China from the international community. We believe that as time goes by, these views will increasingly become the consensus of the majority of people in the international community. It is clear that it is the West that continues to put pressure on China. However, the political declaration of the summit of the seven countries expresses the hope that the Chinese authorities will create conditions to avoid isolation, which is completely putting the cart before the horse. It must be pointed out that China is a country with a global strategic position and a huge real and potential market. In today's world where economic interdependence is deepening, the shortsighted behavior of attempting to isolate China from the international community will not only harm world peace and stability but will also be detrimental to the interests of Western countries. We advise those who adopt a hostile attitude towards China to broaden their vision. "Those who tied the bell must untie it"; they should change their tune and adopt a wise and realistic attitude.

The political declaration also mentions the issue of restoring confidence in Hong Kong. The British government recently expressed its continued adherence to the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue, and we appreciate this. China continues to adhere to the principle of "one country, two systems," and will not change Hong Kong's capitalist system in accordance with the agreement. You do your capitalism, and I do my socialism, each to their own. We believe that as long as both sides strictly adhere to the agreement, restoring confidence in Hong Kong can be achieved. The current problem is that some people want to use Hong Kong as a base to interfere with or attempt to change the socialist system on the mainland, which is not allowed. We advise these people not to lift a stone only to drop it on their own feet. We hope that the statement of the summit of the seven countries about Hong Kong's "continued support from the international community" will not become a factor in disrupting Hong Kong's stability.

It should be clearly seen that the current trend and overall situation of international developments have not changed. The world still faces the two major issues of peace and development. After the long-term tension and confrontation between East and West since the war, there has been a trend towards dialogue from confrontation and towards easing from tension. The trend of a multipolar world is still developing. These factors influencing the basic trends of the world still exist. Therefore, China's foreign policy of peace and independent self-reliance will not change. We are willing to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

### 中国的内政不容干涉——评西方七国首脑会议关于中国的声明

    中国的内政不容干涉
    ——评西方七国首脑会议关于中国的声明
    中国平息北京发生的反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利之后，由于政府采取了一系列果断措施，首都和全国局势迅速得到稳定。一个多月来，社会秩序已经逐步恢复正常，人们的生产和工作也已走上了正轨。北京地区的这场动乱、暴乱的始末与平暴过程的真相已大白于天下。国际社会越来越多的人对中国政府处理这场事端所采取的措施表示理解。很多国家的有识之士对中国一再重申改革开放政策不变这一点表示赞赏并采取了现实和明智的态度。他们都强调要珍惜同中国长期建立起来的友好合作关系，认为继续发展同中国的关系对远东与世界的和平、稳定和繁荣都是至关重要的。
    令人遗憾的是，最近在巴黎举行的西方七国首脑会议，继续无视中国发生的实际情况，凭借他们的所谓“价值观”来充当法官，评断中国的事情。他们在发表的政治宣言中，对中国平息反革命暴乱横加指责，“谴责”所谓“中国违反人权的暴力镇压”。西方七国首脑会议的这种指责是毫无道理的，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。中国政府和人民理所当然不能接受。
    事实已经表明，北京地区发生的这场动乱和反革命暴乱，是少数阴谋分子勾结国外敌对势力利用学潮，有计划、有组织地挑动起来、强加在我们头上的。他们的目的是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆我们的社会主义制度。北京发生的这场动乱和暴乱，持续时间之久、波及范围之广、危害之烈、阴谋之毒、手段之残暴，是我国建国以来所罕见的，在世界上也是少有的。在中华人民共和国面临生死存亡威胁的严重关头，中国政府没有别的选择，只能采取迅速果断的行动，平息这场暴乱，使局面转危为安。中国政府是根据我国人民的最大利益在十分复杂而困难的条件下，迫不得已采取行动的。
    本来事情的真相是不难明白的。但是，由于某些西方国家的舆论，特别是美国的舆论，对中国平息暴乱竭尽夸大、歪曲之能事。“谣言公司”兴风作浪，唯恐天下不乱，使西方的人们得出了完全错误和扭曲的印象。而某些西方国家的政府人士又不愿冷静地坐下来好好听取中国方面所提供的事实真相，固执己见，囿于西方那套价值观，一味地对中国加以谴责和制裁，恣意干涉中国的内政。这种做法是违背国际法准则的。如果在国际关系中，不是客观、公正地去了解事情的是非曲直，而仅仅根据歪曲事实的舆论宣传、错误的情报甚至荒谬的谣言来制定自己的政策，这不仅是极不严肃的，也是非常危险的。
    这次七国首脑会议继续对中国施加压力，企图迫使中国放弃这场反对暴乱、反对颠覆的正义斗争，这是打错了算盘。需要指出的是，中国政府采取的行动并没有触犯西方，也没有触犯哪一个国家。问题出在有的国家却以他们的好恶和价值观念，在言论上、行动上，在很大的范围内直接触犯了中国的利益和尊严。任何妄图干涉中国内政的做法都是徒劳的，对于来自任何国家的这种或那种方式的压力，中国政府和人民决不会屈服，相反，它只会激发起中国人民艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神，把自己国家的建设搞得更好。同时，我们也有必要在此重申：现在，当平息反革命暴乱已经取得决定性胜利后，中国政府和人民也决不会因为某些国家对我们的不友好行动而改变改革开放的基本国策。邓小平同志最近明确指出，党的十一届三中全会制定的坚持四项基本原则和改革开放的方针要坚定不移地干下去。10年来的实践证明，这一方针是我们的立国之本和强国之路，它不仅给中国人民带来了前所未有的好处，也加强了世界各国同中国的经济交往，促进了世界的繁荣与稳定。
    目前，国际上越来越多的人士相信，中国在平息反革命暴乱之后改革开放的方针没有改变，他们希望继续保持和发展同中国的经济贸易关系，反对把中国排斥于国际社会之外的错误做法。我们相信，随着时间的推移，这些见解将日益成为国际上大多数人士的共识。明明是西方继续在对中国施加压力，七国首脑会议的政治声明却表示希望中国当局为避免孤立创造条件，这完全是本末倒置。必须指出，中国是一个具有全球战略地位的国家和拥有巨大的现实和潜在的市场。在当今世界经济相互依存日益加深的情况下，那种企图把中国孤立于国际社会之外的短视行为，不仅会损害世界的和平与稳定，对西方国家的利益也是有害的。我们奉劝那些对中国采取敌视态度的人还是把目光放远一点。“解铃还需系铃人”，他们还是改弦更张，采取明智、现实的态度为好。
    政治宣言中还说到恢复香港信心的问题。英国政府不久前表示继续遵守中英关于香港问题的联合声明，我们对此表示赞赏。中国继续坚持“一国两制”，按照协议不改变香港的资本主义制度。你搞你的资本主义，我搞我的社会主义，井水不犯河水。我们相信，只要双方严格遵守协议，恢复香港信心是可以做到的。现在的问题是有人要想利用香港作为干预或图谋改变内地社会主义制度的基地，这是不能允许的。我们奉劝这些人不要搬起石头砸了自己的脚。我们希望七国首脑会议关于香港问题所说的“国际社会的继续支持”不要成为破坏香港稳定的因素。
    应该清楚地看到，当前国际形势的发展趋势和大格局没有改变，世界面临的仍然是和平与发展两大课题。东西方关系历经战后长期的紧张与对峙之后，出现了从对抗走向对话、从紧张走向缓和的势头。世界多极化的趋势仍然在发展。这些影响世界基本趋势的因素依然存在。因此，我国对外执行的和平与独立自主的外交政策也不会改变。我们愿意根据和平共处五项原则来发展同世界各国的友好关系。
