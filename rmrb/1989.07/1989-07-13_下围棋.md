Playing Go

Huang Ming (Painting) Zhao Mu (Poetry)

Ink like jade, stones like jade,
Each point clearly defined.
A horizontal line, a vertical line,
On the battlefield, troops are deployed.
A small chessboard, a vast universe,
Who says it has nothing to do with us?
Sometimes losing, sometimes winning,
Whoever is most focused will see.
Under the melon shed, under the tree shade,
Counting stars at the end of the game.
Golden childhood, golden youth,
Here, one understands life.

    下围棋
    黄明画  赵牧诗墨如玉　白如玉　点点皆分明横一道　竖一道　沙场各布兵小棋盘　大宇宙　谁说不关情有时输　有时赢　看谁最专心瓜棚里　树荫下　终局数星星金童年　金少年　此处悟人生
