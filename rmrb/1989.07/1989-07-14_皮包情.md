    The Heartwarming Story of a Lost Bag
    Our company sent four of us to Beijing Changcheng Company to purchase computers on April 19. Unfortunately, we lost a bag containing over 600 yuan in cash, a cashier's check for 25,700 yuan, invoices worth 69,000 yuan, and purchase contracts totaling over 70,000 yuan. The next morning, we went to Changcheng Company with a glimmer of hope and, with the help of Mr. Dai Qiguang, began searching for it. When we arrived at the Beijing 05 Materials Supply Station Guesthouse, the service staff member Wang Huayun saw our anxious expressions and immediately came over to ask what was wrong. After we explained the situation, she took out the bag.

    It turned out that on the morning of April 19, Wang Huayun found the bag on the floor while cleaning the room. At that time, there was no one around. She immediately found a nearby guest to witness the event and, together with the accountant and the guesthouse manager, checked the contents of the bag. They then began searching for the owner, but by evening, no one had come forward to claim it. Early on the 20th, she saw us rushing in and thus presented us with the bag.

    皮包情
    我们公司一行4人于4月19日到北京长城公司购买计算机，不慎将装有600多元现金、2.57万元现金汇票、6.9万元发票、7万多元购销合同的皮包丢失了。第二天一早，我们抱着一线希望在长城公司戴启贵同志的帮助下挨处查找。当我们找到北京05物资供应站招待所时，服务员王华云同志一看我们焦急的样子，便主动上前询问。她向我们问清情况后，便拿出皮包。
    原来，19日上午，王华云同志在收拾房间时，发现地上有个皮包，当时旁无一人。她马上就近找了一名旅客作证，会同会计和招待所领导人一起清点了包里的东西，然后分头查找失主，一直找到傍晚也无人认领。20日一早，她看到我们几人行色匆匆地赶来，于是便出现了前文感人至深的一幕。
