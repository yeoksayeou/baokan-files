    Beijing commercial workers are boosting their spirits and overcoming difficulties to make active contributions to recovering losses.

    The turmoil and riots have caused significant losses to Beijing's commercial and service industries, severely impacting the realization of the half-year and even the full-year plans. However, the original contracted base numbers issued by the city remain unchanged.

    Zhang Hongge, Director of the Beijing Municipal Commerce Commission, emphasized at the city's commercial work meeting on July 18 that only by completing the original contracted base numbers can losses truly be recovered. He said that the current situation is improving, with a significant increase in transient customers from other regions and the return of most foreign businesspeople. The market still faces a situation where total demand exceeds total supply, and the accumulation of goods is only a temporary phenomenon. Commercial departments must remove mental barriers and use every means to expand sales and increase business income. Enterprises that previously focused on transient customers and high-end services should lower their standards, remove high barriers, and change their mindset of pursuing large deals and avoiding small ones. They should start by increasing small deals, adding mid-to-low-end service content, and selling at low profits and high volumes. They should explore various ways to increase revenue, organize diverse exhibitions, temple fairs, and night markets to attract customers with concentrated and colorful goods. They should increase the variety of goods, add service items, set up more stalls, expand business areas, and extend business hours to convenience customers. For goods with large inventories and high gross profits, prices should be reduced where necessary, and profits should be shared as much as possible. Goods not subject to the city's quantity restrictions should be organized for sales to other regions and rural areas, making the business more dynamic.

    While mobilizing the broad masses of workers to give full play to their subjective initiative, the Beijing Municipal Commerce Commission also requires strict implementation of price policies and resolute control of price levels. It actively cooperates with relevant departments to rectify wholesale enterprises, crack down on illegal reselling of price-controlled goods, strengthen commodity inspection work, prevent substandard and counterfeit goods from entering the market, and protect consumers' interests.

    北京动员商业职工振奋精神夺回损失
    原定承包基数不变  广辟门路做活生意
    本报北京7月19日讯　记者颜世贵报道：北京市商业职工振奋精神，克服畏难情绪，为夺回损失做出积极的贡献。
    动乱和暴乱给北京市商业服务业造成了巨大的损失，严重影响了上半年乃至全年计划的实现，但市里下达的“两保一挂”的承包基数不变。
    市商委主任张洪阁在18日市商业工作会议上强调，只有按照原定的承包基数完成了，才是真正夺回损失。他说，目前形势在好转，外地来京的流动顾客已有很大回升，外国商人多数已经回来。市场上仍是总需求大于总供给，商品积压不过是短暂现象。商业部门要排除思想障碍，千方百计扩大销售，增加营业收入。过去以流动顾客为主、以高中档服务为主的企业，放下大架子，砍掉高门坎，改变追求大买卖、不愿做小买卖的思想，从增加小买卖、增加中低档服务内容、薄利多销做起，广开创收门路，大办形式多样的展销会、庙会和夜市，以商品集中和丰富多彩吸引顾客。尽可能增加经营内容，增加服务项目，增设摊点，扩大营业场地，延长营业时间，方便顾客。对库存大的商品，毛利大的商品，该削价的就削价，能让利的尽量让利。凡不属本市定量限量的商品，组织销售队伍向市外、向农村销售，把生意做活。
    北京市商委在动员广大职工发挥主观能动性时，还要求严格执行物价政策，坚决控制物价水平。并积极配合有关部门，对批发企业进行整顿，打击倒卖平价商品的违法行为，加强商品的检验工作，防止低劣假冒商品进入市场，保护消费者利益。
