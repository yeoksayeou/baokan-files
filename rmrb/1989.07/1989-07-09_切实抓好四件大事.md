At the significant 13th Party Congress Fourth Plenary Session, the Party Central Committee, in light of the evolving situation, outlined the current tasks and emphasized the need to focus on four key areas: First, to thoroughly stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, clearly distinguish between two types of contradictions, and further stabilize the national situation; second, to continue with the rectification and consolidation, better adhere to reform and opening up, and promote sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development; third, to seriously strengthen ideological and political work, vigorously promote education on patriotism, socialism, independence, and self-reliance, and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization; fourth, to strengthen the Party's construction, strengthen democratic and legal construction, resolutely punish corruption, and effectively address issues of concern to the people, ensuring that the Party does not disappoint the people's expectations.

These four key tasks are of great importance and are urgent matters. Focusing on and effectively addressing these four tasks is not only crucial for the current morale, spirit, and further stabilization of the national situation, and for consolidating the achievements of construction and reform; it is also of great significance for ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and for ensuring the long-term stability and smooth progress of socialist construction.

Thoroughly stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion is the top political task at present. Over the past two months, a small number of individuals have used student movements to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil, which then escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. Their goal in instigating the turmoil and rebellion was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. After achieving decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, to eliminate hidden dangers and root out the source of trouble, we must resolutely identify and punish those who planned, organized, and directed the rebellion, as well as the core members of illegal organizations and those who committed serious crimes such as beating, smashing, looting, arson, and murder. If we allow them to go unpunished, it will leave endless trouble, causing unrest for the country and the people. We must not show any mercy to these ruthless enemies. If we are lenient, we will make a historical mistake and leave behind trouble. In this struggle, we must strictly follow the law, clearly distinguish between guilt and innocence, and base our actions on facts and the law; we must resolutely implement policies and strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. We should believe that the vast majority of the masses, including the majority of young students, support the Party's leadership and the socialist system. In this turmoil, even if some people had extreme actions, their intentions were generally good, and many of their opinions were reasonable. For those who were misled and participated in marches, support, and hunger strikes, the main issue is education. We should enthusiastically help them study Deng Xiaoping's speeches and the documents of the 13th Party Congress Fourth Plenary Session, raise their awareness, summarize experiences, and learn lessons. Only by uniting and winning over as many people as possible can we truly isolate, expose, and strike at the few bad elements. For those injured during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, we must take responsibility for the aftermath.

Continuing with the rectification and consolidation, better adhering to reform and opening up, is an urgent task for the current economic work. All levels of leadership must focus on both stopping the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stabilizing the situation, as well as on rectification and consolidation, and deepening reform. The prosperity of the state and the wealth of the people ultimately depend on economic strength. The broad masses of the people are looking forward to economic development, the continuous increase of social material wealth, and the gradual improvement of material and cultural living standards. With economic construction as the center, we must do everything possible to develop the economy. This is the will of the people. The reason why everyone resolutely supports the stopping of the turmoil and the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion is that the turmoil and rebellion disrupted and destroyed the center of economic construction, disrupted and destroyed the stable social environment needed for economic construction, and disrupted and destroyed the development of productive forces. In a recent speech, Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The economy cannot slide. We should actively strive for development speed where possible, but we should not aim as high as before." "This time, to solve the problem of economic decline, we need to clean up the urgent problems that need to be solved. Problems that need to be solved should be solved quickly, using a decisive approach. If we hesitate, it will cause trouble." Deng Xiaoping's views are very important. In our rectification and consolidation and deepening of reform, we must pay great attention to these views, making the cause of reform and opening up advance more steadily, better, and even faster, and ensuring the healthy development of economic construction.

Seriously strengthening ideological and political work, conducting thorough education on patriotism, socialism, independence, and self-reliance, and resolutely opposing bourgeois liberalization, is a major task and an important guarantee for doing all work well. Over the past few years, people's material living standards have improved, but tendencies such as "everything for money," pursuing high consumption, pursuing immediate gains while abandoning long-term ideals, and considering personal interests while ignoring the interests of the state and the nation have grown. Shallow, vulgar, and even corrupt and decadent bad tendencies have emerged, and various ugly phenomena that had already disappeared in the early days of the founding of the nation have reappeared. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, ideological and propaganda work has made great contributions in criticizing the "two whatevers" and promoting ideological liberation, and in exploring the laws of socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up. However, in the past few years, various erroneous trends, especially the decadent thoughts of Western bourgeoisie, have flooded in, and the problems exposed are quite serious. The broad masses of Party members and the people are dissatisfied with this situation. While we are focusing on socialist material civilization construction, we must also focus on socialist spiritual civilization construction, seriously oppose bourgeois liberalization, and strengthen ideological and political work to resolutely correct the situation of being hard on one hand and soft on the other. The vast majority of young people support reform and opening up, but many of them do not understand China's history and reality, and therefore cannot understand the arduousness, long-term nature, and complexity of reform. They fantasize about bringing Western material civilization to China overnight and are easily influenced by propaganda for capitalist systems. Therefore, doing a good job in the ideological and political work of young people, especially strengthening the ideological and political education of young students, so that they gradually mature politically, can firmly uphold the four cardinal principles, recognize and resist the trends of bourgeois liberalization, and become new people with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. This is of special and far-reaching significance for the development of our cause and the future of the country. Ideological and political work is a fine tradition of our Party and our true advantage. The many precious basic principles and important experiences of ideological and political work accumulated in the past revolutionary struggles and socialist construction must be seriously adhered to and applied in combination with new realities. It is wrong to negate history and abandon traditions under the pretext of changing circumstances. We must pay attention to strengthening the construction of the ideological and political work team, care for political work cadres from all aspects, and give full play to their roles. Of course, ideological and political work is about working with people. As the situation changes, the tasks change, and people's circumstances change, the content and methods of ideological and political work must also change. We need to reform, innovate, and develop. We hope that all levels of Party organizations will adhere to seeking truth from facts, carry forward the spirit of creation, and through practice and summary, make ideological and political work more welcome and effective.

Strengthening the Party's construction and democratic and legal construction, and resolutely punishing corruption, is another major task. Through this turmoil and rebellion, we have recognized the seriousness of the problems in Party construction. Now, we must restore the Party's prestige and effectively strengthen and improve the Party's leadership. This must be done as a major task within a major task. Many people, including young students, hope to speed up the construction of democracy and the legal system, which is understandable and consistent with the Party and government's stance. We must take active steps to continue to improve and develop various democratic and legal systems. Institutions that have been established must be seriously implemented. Of course, we can only proceed with democratic and legal construction along the socialist path and track. Any wholesale copying of Western bourgeois systems or any attempts at so-called "great democracy" and causing turmoil are firmly opposed by the broad masses of the people. In this turmoil and rebellion, one important reason why so many people were drawn in is that some Party members and cadres, especially a small number of leading cadres, have engaged in corrupt practices, causing strong dissatisfaction among the people. Of course, the slogan of opposing corruption is a cover for the planners and organizers of the turmoil and rebellion, whose goal is to use the opposition to corruption to incite people who do not understand the truth. But for us, to rectify our Party and achieve our strategic goals, to strengthen the Party's ties with the people and enhance the Party's prestige, we must punish corruption. As Comrade Chen Yun pointed out, the style of work of a ruling party is a matter of life and death for the Party. Therefore, we must seriously launch an anti-corruption campaign nationwide, starting within the Party, and expose a number of major cases to the public. Those who deserve punishment, no matter who they are, must be punished. If we do not resolutely clean up corruption, our Party will seriously alienate the people, and there may still be trouble.

In summary, the above four major tasks are a concrete manifestation of continuing to implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" formulated by the 13th Party Congress. The four major tasks represent the interests of the people, and the people hope that the four major tasks will be well addressed. The turmoil and rebellion have caused tremendous losses to the country and the people, and we are facing many difficulties. "The more difficulties, the more prosperous the country." Bad things can be turned into good things. The Communist Party of China, which has been tempered by trials, will surely lead the Chinese people to overcome all interference, overcome various difficulties, quickly make up for the losses, and continue to advance the cause of socialist modernization.

    切实抓好四件大事
    在具有重要意义的十三届四中全会上，党中央根据形势的发展，部署了当前的工作，提出要特别注意抓好四件大事：一是彻底制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，进一步稳定全国局势；二是继续搞好治理整顿，更好地坚持改革开放，促进经济持续、稳定、协调地发展；三是认真加强思想政治工作，努力开展爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗的教育，切实反对资产阶级自由化；四是大力加强党的建设，大力加强民主和法制建设，坚决惩治腐败，切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情，决不辜负人民对党的期望。
    这四件大事，关系重大，确属当务之急。抓紧办好这四件大事，不仅对于当前鼓舞人心，振奋精神，进一步稳定全国局势，巩固建设和改革的成果，具有重大作用；而且对于今后保证十一届三中全会以来党的路线、方针、政策的连续性，保证国家的长治久安和社会主义建设事业的顺利进行，也具有重要意义。
    彻底制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，是当前第一位的政治任务。两个多月来，极少数人利用学潮，掀起一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在北京发展成了反革命暴乱。他们策动动乱和暴乱的目的就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。在取得制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱决定性胜利之后，为了消除隐患，铲除祸根，我们要下决心把那些暴乱、动乱的策划者、组织者和幕后指挥者，各种非法组织的骨干分子和进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀等严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，彻底清查出来，及时依法惩处。如果让他们逍遥法外，必将后患无穷，使国无宁日，民无宁日。对这些凶残的敌人，连百分之一的原谅都不应有。如果手软，那就会犯历史性的错误，留下后患。在这场斗争中，要严格依法办事，划清罪与非罪的界限，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳；要坚决执行政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。我们应该坚信，广大群众包括青年学生的绝大多数是拥护党的领导、拥护社会主义制度的。在这次动乱中，即使有些人有过激的言行，总的来说，他们的愿望是善良的，他们的许多意见是合理的。对于一时不明真相，参加过游行、声援、绝食的人，主要是教育问题。要热情帮助他们学习邓小平同志的讲话和十三届四中全会文件，提高认识，总结经验，吸取教训。只有最大限度地争取和团结一切可以团结的人，才能真正孤立、揭露和打击极少数坏人。对于在平息反革命暴乱中被误伤的人员，要认真负责地做好善后工作。
    继续搞好治理整顿，更好地坚持改革开放，这是当前经济工作的迫切任务。各级领导要一手抓彻底平息反革命暴乱和稳定局势的工作，一手抓治理整顿，深化改革。国家的昌盛，人民的富裕，说到底是经济实力问题。广大群众都盼望着经济发展，盼望着社会物质财富不断增长，盼望着物质文化生活水平逐步提高。以经济建设为中心，千方百计把经济搞上去，这是民心所向。大家坚决拥护制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱，一个重要原因就是因为动乱和暴乱干扰和破坏了经济建设这个中心，干扰和破坏了经济建设所需要的稳定的社会环境，干扰和破坏了社会生产力的发展。邓小平同志在最近的一次讲话中指出：“经济不能滑坡。凡是能够积极争取的发展速度还是要积极争取，当然不要求过去想的那么高。”“这次解决经济滑坡的问题，要清理一下急需解决哪些问题。应该解决的问题要加快解决，要用快刀斩乱麻的办法解决，不能拖。当断不断，要误事。”邓小平同志的这些意见十分重要，在我们进行治理整顿和深化改革时，要十分重视，使改革开放的事业前进得更稳，更好，甚至更快，使经济建设健康发展。
    认真加强思想政治工作，对广大干部群众认真进行爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗的教育，切实反对资产阶级自由化，是一件大事，也是做好各项工作的重要保证。几年来，人们的物质生活水平提高了，但是“一切向钱看”，追求高消费，追求眼前实惠而放弃远大理想，计较个人私利而不顾国家、民族整体利益，鄙薄自己的祖国和人民而崇洋媚外等思想倾向滋长了，浅薄、庸俗甚至腐化、堕落的不良风气发生了，建国初期早就已经绝迹的种种丑恶现象再度出现了。党的十一届三中全会以后，思想宣传工作在批评“两个凡是”，促进思想解放方面，在探讨社会主义现代化建设和改革开放的规律方面，做出了很大的贡献。但是后几年中，各种错误思潮特别是西方资产阶级腐朽思想纷至沓来，暴露出来的问题相当严重。对这种状况，广大党员和人民群众都是不满意的。我们一定要在抓紧社会主义物质文明建设的同时，抓紧社会主义精神文明建设，认真反对资产阶级自由化，大力加强思想政治工作，坚决纠正一手硬、一手软的状况。广大青年拥护改革开放，但是他们中不少人不了解中国的历史和现实，因此也就不可能了解改革的艰巨性、长期性和复杂性，幻想在一夜之间把西方的物质文明搬到中国的土地上，比较容易接受实行资本主义制度的宣传。因此，做好青年的思想政治工作，尤其是加强对青年学生的思想政治教育，使他们在政治上逐步成熟起来，能够坚持四项基本原则，识别和抵制资产阶级自由化思潮，成为有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的新人，这对我们事业的发展、国家的未来，有特别重要的深远的意义。思想政治工作是我们党的优良传统，是我们的真正优势所在。过去革命斗争和社会主义建设中积累起来的许多宝贵的思想政治工作的基本原则、重要经验，要结合新的实际，认真地加以坚持，加以运用。借口情况变化而全盘否定历史、抛弃传统，是错误的。要重视加强思想政治工作队伍的建设，从各方面关心政治工作干部，充分发挥他们的作用。当然，思想政治工作是做人的工作，形势变了，任务变了，人的情况变了，思想政治工作的内容和方法也得变，需要改革，需要创新，需要发展。我们希望各级党组织坚持实事求是，发扬创造精神，通过实践和总结，使思想政治工作更受人们欢迎，更有成效。
    大力加强党的建设，大力加强民主和法制建设，坚决惩治腐败，这又是一件大事。通过这场动乱和暴乱，使我们认识到党的建设方面存在问题的严重性。现在，我们要重振党的威信，切实加强和改善党的领导，非抓好党的自身建设不可。这要作为大事中的大事来做。许多群众包括青年学生希望加快民主法制建设，是可以理解的，是同党和政府的主张一致的。我们要采取积极的步骤，继续完善和发展各项民主制度和法律制度。已经建立起来的制度，要认真贯彻实行。当然，我们只能沿着社会主义的方向和轨道进行民主和法制建设，任何照搬照抄西方资产阶级的一套，任何搞所谓“大民主”、搞动乱的办法，都是广大人民所坚决反对的。在这次动乱和暴乱中，有那么多人被卷进去，还有一个重要原因，是一些党员、干部，特别是极少数领导干部中存在腐败现象，引起人们的强烈不满。当然，反对腐败的口号是动乱和暴乱的策划者、组织者的一个陪衬，其目的是用反腐败来煽动不明真相的群众。但对我们来说，要整好我们的党，实现我们的战略目标，要使党同群众的联系得以巩固和增强，党的威信得以提高，不惩治腐败是不行的。正如陈云同志指出的那样，执政党的党风是关系到党的生死存亡的大问题。为此，要在全国范围内首先在党内认真地抓反腐败斗争，抓一批大案公布于众。该受惩罚的，不管是谁，一律受惩罚。如果不痛下决心清除腐败现象，那么，我们党将会严重脱离群众，那就还可能出乱子。
    以上四件大事，概括起来说，就是继续贯彻执行党的十三大制定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线的具体体现。四件大事代表人民利益，人民希望办好四件大事。动乱和暴乱，给国家和人民造成了巨大损失，我们面临着很多困难。“多难兴邦”，坏事可以变成好事。久经考验的中国共产党一定能够领导中国人民排除一切干扰，克服各种困难，尽快弥补损失，把社会主义现代化事业继续推向前进。
