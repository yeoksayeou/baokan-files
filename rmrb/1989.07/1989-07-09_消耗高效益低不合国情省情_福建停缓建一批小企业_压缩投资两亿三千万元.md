Fujian Province has halted or slowed the construction of more than 250 township enterprises that consume high amounts of energy and raw materials but have low efficiency, reducing investment by 230 million yuan.

Fujian is a province with a shortage of energy and raw materials. In recent years, the rapid expansion of small enterprises such as cement, caustic soda, paper, and cotton spinning, which consume high amounts of energy and raw materials but have low efficiency, has not only squeezed the limited national funds but also competed with large enterprises for the already scarce energy, raw materials, and transportation capacity.

During the recent cleanup of fixed asset investment construction projects, Fujian Province, in accordance with the state's industrial policies and the province's requirements for adjusting the industrial structure in the near future, has also halted the construction of several ongoing projects that produce electronic keyboards, induction cookers, welding machines, and other products with repeated construction.

    消耗高效益低不合国情省情
    福建停缓建一批小企业
    压缩投资两亿三千万元
    新华社福州7月8日电（记者张瑞三）福建省已停缓建250多个能源、原材料消耗高、效益差的乡镇企业，压缩投资2.3亿元。
    福建是个能源和原材料短缺的省份。而前些年一些高耗能、高耗料、低效益的水泥、烧碱、造纸、棉纺等小企业的膨胀，不仅挤占了国家有限的资金，还与大企业争夺本来就十分紧张的能源、原材料和运力。
    在最近进行的清理固定资产投资建设项目当中，福建省依照国家的产业政策和本省近期产业结构调整的要求，还停建了一些生产电子琴、电磁灶、电焊机等重复建设的在建项目。
