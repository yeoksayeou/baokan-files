Beijing Investigates and Punishes Nine Major Economic Cases

More Than 300 Cases of Illegal Activities Involving Over 1,000 Yuan Each Discovered This Year

Beijing, July 27 — The head of the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce today briefed the capital's media on the nine major economic illegal cases that have been strictly investigated and punished according to law. A total of 5.505 million yuan in fines and confiscations were imposed. For those who violated the law, they have been handed over to judicial authorities with a recommendation to pursue criminal responsibility for the persons in charge and directly responsible individuals. For other cases, administrative responsibilities have been recommended for the higher authorities, or business licenses have been revoked.

The units involved in these illegal cases include: Beijing Municipal Machinery and Electrical Equipment Company's Machinery Equipment Branch, Beijing Petrochemical Research Equipment Joint Service Company, Beijing Municipal Pastoral Industrial Western Red Gate Wire Rod Factory, Beijing Huatai Industrial Company, China Metallurgical Construction Company, Beijing Municipal Chemical Industry Corporation's Chemical Investment Company, Guangming Daily's Digest Newspaper, China Tongguang Electronics Company's Broadcasting and Television Technology Service Company, and Jingchao Rural Construction Materials Company, among others.

Some of these units used state foreign exchange and import rights to illegally trade in important production materials that the state does not allow to be freely bought and sold. Some used material allocation rights to exchange power for money. Some engaged in illegal resale with markups, and others provided bank accounts, funds, and sources of goods for speculative activities, collaborating internally and externally to seek excessive profits.

Beijing Municipal Machinery and Electrical Equipment Company's Machinery Equipment Branch used its authority over automobile operations to, under the guise of joint ventures, provide accounts for the illegal resale of automobiles by Hebei Province's Zhuozhou County Machinery and Electrical Equipment Company and its branch in Haidian. They also invested 4 million yuan to directly participate in the illegal resale of 65 new and used automobiles.

The head of the Beijing Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce said that the next step will focus on investigating and cleaning up illegal business activities of all enterprises, institutions, party and government organs, and social organizations in Beijing that have set up businesses.

Meanwhile, it is reported that from January to July this year, Beijing has uncovered 332 cases of illegal speculative activities involving more than 1,000 yuan each, imposing fines and confiscations totaling 11.616 million yuan. Among these, there were 20 cases involving more than 100,000 yuan, and 76 cases involving more than 10,000 yuan, representing increases of 64% and 5.9 times respectively compared to the same period last year.
