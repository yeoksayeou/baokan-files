The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice, commending 64 advanced grassroots party organizations and 76 outstanding party workers across the military. Among them are some grassroots party organizations and outstanding party workers who emerged in the recent struggle against turmoil and the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital.

The notice from the General Political Department points out that in recent years, the military has, in implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, persisted in reform and opening up, completed various tasks, and strengthened the Party's own construction, especially in the recent struggle against turmoil and the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital. A large number of advanced grassroots party organizations and outstanding party workers have emerged. They have, in various positions, through effective work, fully played the role of party organizations as fortresses and party members as vanguards and models, united and led the masses to successfully complete various tasks, adding glory to the Party and the military.

The notice calls on all levels of party organizations and party workers across the military to learn from their political firmness, resolutely implement the Party's line, principles, and policies, and clearly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization; learn from their loyalty to the Party's cause, dedication to party work, and efforts to advance the Party's own construction; learn from their strict implementation of Party regulations, maintenance of Party discipline, and resolute struggle against various corrupt practices; learn from their persistence and skill in ideological and political work, and lead the troops to contribute to national defense construction with their model actions. The notice requires all levels of party organizations and all Communist Party members in the military to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies of the Party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and unite more closely around the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. It calls for leveraging the fine traditions of the Party and the military to strive for the strengthening of military party construction and modernization.

It is reported that, on the eve of July 1st, the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, Guangzhou Military Region, Lanzhou Military Region, and other units also commended a batch of advanced party organizations, outstanding party workers, and model Communist Party members.
