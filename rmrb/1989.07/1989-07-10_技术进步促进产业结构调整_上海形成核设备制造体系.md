The task of manufacturing equipment for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has led Shanghai to develop a new high-tech sector in nuclear equipment manufacturing and processing. Currently, over a hundred industrial enterprises in the city are capable of manufacturing or participating in the production of 300,000 or 600,000 kilowatt nuclear power plants' nuclear islands or conventional islands. The 1,400-plus non-standard equipment items, totaling 140 types, have mostly been delivered to the Qinshan site for installation.

To manufacture the main equipment for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant, Shanghai has invested 1.5 billion yuan in technological upgrades for construction, manufacturing, and testing facilities. During the manufacturing process, relevant Shanghai enterprises have established equipment manufacturing standards and quality assurance systems through both importing technology and independent research. These systems have passed multiple rigorous inspections by the National Nuclear Safety Administration and the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Shanghai now has nearly 10,000 technical experts with specialized certifications in design, process standards, and quality assurance. They have overcome numerous technical challenges and received praise from experts at the International Atomic Energy Agency. This is a valuable asset for Shanghai.

Manufacturing equipment for the Qinshan Nuclear Power Plant has significantly enhanced the capabilities of some of Shanghai's industrial enterprises. The Shanghai Boiler Factory, which previously had the largest workshop capable of handling 100-ton equipment and the largest processing capacity for 200-ton equipment, now has a newly built 400-ton workshop that can process 800-ton giant equipment. The Shanghai First Machine Tool Factory, through manufacturing reactor components, has mastered the key technologies for high-precision machine tools and applied these to their main products, gear processing machine tools, leading to an upgrade of their conventional products. An Italian machine tool company has decided to collaborate with the factory to produce large-scale boring and milling machines for the Asian market.

    技术进步促进产业结构调整
    上海形成核设备制造体系
    本报上海7月10日电　承担秦山核电站设备制造的任务促使上海形成了一个新的核设备制造和加工的高技术门类。目前全市已有百余家工业企业能为主或参与配套制造30或60万千瓦级核电站的核岛或常规岛的设备，所承制的140多项1400多台件非标准设备绝大多数已交付秦山工地安装。
    为了承制秦山核电站的主要设备，上海先后投资1.5亿元进行了土建、建造和检测手段的技术改造。在承制过程中，上海的有关企业通过引进或自行研究形成的设备制造规范和质量保证体系，多次经受了国家核安全局和国际原子能机构的严格检查。
    上海已拥有一支近万人的设计、工艺规范、质量保证的具有特种专业证书的技术骨干队伍。他们攻下了许多技术难关，受到了国际原子能机构专家的赞赏。这是上海的一笔宝贵财富。
    承制秦山核电站设备大大增强了上海一些工业企业的实力。上海锅炉厂原来最大的厂房为100吨级，最大加工能力是200吨级的设备，如今，新建成的400吨级厂房可以加工800吨级的巨型设备。上海第一机床厂通过制造堆内构件，掌握了高精度加工机床的关键技术，并将其移植到工厂主导产品齿轮加工机床上，使常规产品升级换代。意大利一家机床公司已决定与该厂合作生产销往亚洲市场的大型镗铣床。
