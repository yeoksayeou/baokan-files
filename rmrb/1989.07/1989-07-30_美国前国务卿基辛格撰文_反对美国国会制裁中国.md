People's Daily, Bonn, July 30th. Reporter Jiang Jianguo reports: Former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger today wrote an exclusive article for the West German "Sunday World" titled "The United States Cannot Abandon China." In the article, Kissinger points out that the United States and China need each other. If the United States withdraws from China during its period of change and adopts policies that China perceives as attempts to overthrow its government, it would be extremely unwise.

The article states: "After a rare and shallow debate, the U.S. House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass a resolution to impose sanctions on China that go far beyond the measures already taken by President Bush. This vote is unprecedented. I have never before seen a president or a Congress respond to an internal event of a major country with sanctions."

The article points out that no government in the world would tolerate tens of thousands of protesters occupying its capital's most important square for eight weeks and obstructing the country's representatives from approaching the most important government buildings.

The article believes that China is too important to U.S. national security, and bilateral relations between the United States and China should not be taken lightly due to current emotional reactions. The main international landscape has not changed due to the Chinese incident.

The article says that anyone familiar with Chinese history and traditional attitudes will understand why President Bush does not want to lead the United States down a dangerous and unwise path.

Kissinger said: "I know Deng Xiaoping. He is a reformer and a good friend of the United States. I believe it is incorrect to portray Deng Xiaoping as a dictator in front of the American public. Over the past decade, he has been the driving force behind China's reforms."

The article states that in early May, Zhao Ziyang said that the students' protests were not a serious matter, which was a public disagreement with Deng Xiaoping. Two weeks later, when meeting Gorbachev, Zhao Ziyang again said on television that all important decisions were made by Deng Xiaoping. This was seen as an attempt to shift all responsibility onto Deng Xiaoping. At this point, it became clear that the protesters had the support of more powerful and organized forces. Without food and medical supplies, tens of thousands of protesters could not have survived on the square for so many days.

The government could not possibly take no action when it saw itself being overthrown. For centuries, the most important goal of Chinese domestic politics has been to maintain national unity. The Chinese people clearly remember how foreign powers exploited China's disunity to plunder the country. Deng Xiaoping saw this protest not only as an attack on the Chinese government but also as a threat to China's unity and independence. If the government did not control Tiananmen Square, its leadership over other regions of China would quickly disappear.

Kissinger said in the article that going further than President Bush would only show weakness. Sanctions against China will ultimately fail, and geopolitical realities also require the United States and China to move closer again.

He said: "U.S.-China relations have been able to develop from the time of Mao Zedong to Deng Xiaoping because the United States has maintained a distance from China's internal affairs. This attitude is even more important when China's reforms do not end with the Beijing incident. I believe that Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms will continue to move forward."

### 美国前国务卿基辛格撰文  反对美国国会制裁中国

    美国前国务卿基辛格撰文
    反对美国国会制裁中国
    本报波恩7月30日电　记者江建国报道：美国前国务卿基辛格今天在为西德《星期日世界报》撰写的独家文章《美国不能放弃中国》中指出，美中两国互相需要，如果美国在中国处于变革的时期退出中国，奉行被中国认为是试图颠覆其政府的政策，那是极其不明智的。
    文章说：“美国参众两院在经过一场罕见的肤浅的辩论后，以压倒多数通过决议，决定对中国实行远远超出布什总统已经采取的措施之外的制裁。这个表决是史无前例的。我还不曾记得有哪个总统或哪届国会，对一个大国的纯属其职权范围内的事件以制裁的方式作出反应。”
    文章指出，世界上任何一个政府都不会容忍数万示威者对其首都最重要的广场占领8个星期之久，并且阻挠国家的代表靠近最重要的政府建筑物。
    文章认为，中国对美国的国家安全来说是太重要了，美中双边关系不能因为目前感情激动而被当成儿戏。国际关系的主要格局并未因中国事件而发生变化。
    文章说，每一个熟悉中国历史和传统态度的人都会理解，为什么布什总统不想把美国带到一条危险和不明智的路线上去。
    基辛格说：“我认识邓小平，他是一个改革者，也是美国的好朋友。我认为，在美国公众面前，把邓小平描绘成一个独裁者是不正确的。在过去的10余年中，他是推动中国改革的动力。”
    文章说，5月初赵紫阳说大学生的抗议不是一件严重的事，这是公开与邓小平唱反调。两星期后，在接见戈尔巴乔夫时，赵紫阳又在电视上说，所有重要的决定都是邓小平作出的。这被认为他试图把一切责任都推向邓小平。这时已经看清，示威者得到了更有权力和组织的更好的力量的支持。要是没有食品和医疗设施，成万示威者是不可能在这个大广场上生活这么多天的。
    政府眼见它被夺权，不采取行动是完全不可能的。几百年来中国内政的最重要目标就是保持国家的统一。中国人清楚地记得，外国是怎样利用了中国的不统一掠夺了这个国家的。邓小平把这次示威看成不仅是对中国政府的攻击，而且是对中国的统一和独立的威胁。如果政府不控制天安门广场，那它对中国其他地区的领导力很快就会消失。
    基辛格在文章中说，要是比布什总统走得更远那只能显示无能。对中国的制裁迟早要失败，地缘政治的现实也要求美中两国的重新靠拢。
    他说：“美中关系在从毛泽东直至邓小平的历史时期能一直发展，就是因为美国对中国的内政保持了距离。当中国的变革并不因北京事件而结束之机，采取这种态度就更为重要。我相信邓小平所说的经济改革仍将推向前进的话。”
