In the midst of summer in Europe, diplomatic activities have not slowed down due to the vacation season but have instead become even more intense.

In Vienna, negotiations between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on conventional arms reductions in Europe are proceeding at a rapid pace. On May 29, Bush proposed new suggestions at the NATO summit, calling for an agreement between the two sides within six months to a year. NATO experts in the Brussels headquarters are finalizing the details of this plan, preparing to release it in September.

In Geneva, the United States and the Soviet Union resumed talks on strategic and space weapons in mid-June. Both sides are racking their brains to overcome the most challenging obstacles in the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty—inspections, mobile land-based missiles, and the "Star Wars" program. East-West talks on chemical weapons and other issues are also underway simultaneously.

An interesting phenomenon is that the leaders of the two superpowers—President Bush and Chairman Gorbachev—are personally involved, shuttling between Eastern and Western Europe.

Today, Bush departed from Washington to begin what he calls a "historic" visit to Eastern Europe. He will sequentially visit Poland and Hungary, then fly to Paris to attend the Western Seven-Nation Summit opening on July 14.

One week before Bush arrives in Paris, Gorbachev made his second visit to France since 1985 and delivered a speech at the European Commission in Strasbourg. Before this, Gorbachev had separately visited Britain and West Germany. On July 6, he flew from Paris to Bucharest on the eve of Bush's Eastern Europe trip to convene a summit of the seven Warsaw Pact nations.

Currently, international relations are entering a new historical period, and the activities of the United States and the Soviet Union in Europe are exhibiting new characteristics. Gorbachev is taking advantage of the Bush administration's review of its foreign policy to frequently launch peace diplomacy offensives, proposing a series of new suggestions on issues such as reducing tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, which have been widely welcomed by Western European countries. Gorbachev's visits to Britain and West Germany have also been highly successful. In Western public opinion polls, people's trust in Gorbachev far exceeds that in Bush. Bush openly admits that he is at a disadvantage in the "public relations" competition with Gorbachev. However, what most annoys the United States is that Gorbachev skillfully exploits the divisions between the United States and its NATO allies, such as West Germany, on the issue of short-range missiles, and proposes unilateral reduction plans at just the right moment. The White House spokesman angrily denounces this as "incitement."

Bush, on the other hand, sees the political and economic reforms and current economic difficulties of some Eastern European countries as a heaven-sent opportunity to launch a peace diplomacy offensive against the Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc. In April, Bush announced to the American-Polish community that the United States would provide a package of aid to Poland. However, Bush has repeatedly stated on many occasions that American dollar diplomacy is not unconditional; Poland and Hungary must take further "democratic" measures, implement "political pluralism" and a market economy, in order to expect aid from the United States and the West. During a conversation with Polish journalists, Bush also pressingly demanded that the Soviet Union immediately begin withdrawing troops from Poland. On the other hand, Bush claims that his visit to Eastern Europe has no geopolitical purpose, is not an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies, and has no intention of seeking political advantage over the Soviet Union.

According to the New York Times, Gorbachev is annoyed by Bush's involvement in Eastern Europe and repeatedly reminded Western leaders during his talks with Mitterrand to adopt a "responsible attitude" when dealing with Eastern European countries.

### 戈氏访西欧　布什访东欧——引人注目的交叉访问

    戈氏访西欧　布什访东欧——
    引人注目的交叉访问
    新华社记者　怀成波
    在进入盛夏的欧洲，外交活动非但未因休假季节而呈颓势，反而更加如火如荼。
    在维也纳，北约和华约两大军事集团关于欧洲常规裁军的谈判，正在加紧进行。布什5月29日在北约首脑会议上提出新建议，要求双方在半年到一年的时间达成协议。北约专家们在布鲁塞尔总部对这一计划的细节做最后润色，准备在9月份抛出。
    在日内瓦，美苏上月中旬恢复关于战略武器和空间武器的谈判。双方代表为突破限制战略武器条约的最棘手的一些障碍——核查、陆基机动导弹和“星球大战”计划等——而绞尽脑汁。东西方关于化学武器等谈判，也在同时进行。
    一个有趣的现象是，两个超级大国的首脑—布什总统和戈尔巴乔夫主席亲自出马，穿梭于东西欧之间。
    今天，布什从华盛顿起程，开始他称之为“历史性”的东欧之行。他将先后访问波兰和匈牙利，然后飞往巴黎，参加14日开幕的西方7国首脑会议。
    在布什到巴黎的前一个星期，戈尔巴乔夫对法国进行了他1985年以来的第二次访问，并堂而皇之地在斯特拉斯堡欧洲委员会发表演说，在此之前，戈尔巴乔夫还分别访问了英国和西德。7月6日，他又赶在布什东欧之行的前夕，从巴黎飞往布加勒斯特，召开华约7国首脑会议。
    当前，国际关系正进入一个新的历史时期，美苏两个超级大国在欧洲的活动呈现出新特点。戈尔巴乔夫利用布什政府对对外政策进行审查回顾之机，频频发动和平外交攻势，就削减欧洲战术核武器等问题，提出一系列新建议，受到西欧国家的广泛欢迎。戈尔巴乔夫对英国和西德的访问也取得了很大成功。在西方的民意测验中，人们对戈尔巴乔夫的信任程度，远远超过布什。布什公开承认，他在同戈尔巴乔夫的“公关”竞赛中，自叹弗如。但最使美国恼火的是，戈尔巴乔夫巧妙地利用美国同西德等北约盟国在短导问题上的分歧，恰到好处地提出单方面的削减计划。白宫发言人愤怒斥之为“挑拨离间”。
    而布什则把一些东欧国家的政治、经济改革和目前遇到的经济困难，视为向苏联及东欧阵营发动和平外交攻势的天赐良机。今年4月，布什对美籍波兰人社团宣布，美国将向波兰提供一揽子援助计划。但布什在许多场合一再声明，美国的金元外交并不是无条件的，波兰和匈牙利必须按照西方的要求，进一步采取“民主”措施，实行“政治多元化”和市场经济，才能指望美国和西方伸出“援助”之手。布什在同波兰记者谈话时，还咄咄逼人地要求苏联立即开始从波兰撤军。另一方面，布什佯称，他的东欧之行，没有地缘政治目的，并非企图在苏联与其东欧盟国之间打进楔子，也无意谋求对苏联的政治优势。
    据《纽约时报》报道，戈尔巴乔夫对布什插足东欧感到愠怒，在同密特朗会谈期间一再提醒西方领导人，同东欧国家打交道时，要采取“负责任的态度”。　（新华社华盛顿9日电）
