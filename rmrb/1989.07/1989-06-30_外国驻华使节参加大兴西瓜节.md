Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 30th — (Reporter Yang Guoqiang) Today, more than 70 envoys and their spouses from over 50 countries, accompanied by Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and his wife, visited Daxing County in the southern suburbs of Beijing to attend the second Daxing Watermelon Festival.

Daxing County is a key satellite city under construction for Beijing and a major watermelon-producing area. The watermelons here are famous. The watermelon festival, which began last year, aims to turn the watermelon trading market into a park where visitors can admire, taste, and buy watermelons. Outstanding farmers can set up stalls and compete on stage.

Qian Qichen welcomed the envoys and their spouses to the festival. He said, "After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the successful convening of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, your visit to the suburbs of Beijing to see how people here think, work, and live in a stable environment is very meaningful."

During the three-hour visit, the guests tasted excellent watermelons, visited the "Watermelon Street," and enthusiastically went to the fields to pick watermelons, each joyfully carrying back two large watermelons. They also visited the Beijing Bed Sheet Factory.

    外国驻华使节参加大兴西瓜节
    据新华社北京6月30日电　（记者杨国强）今天，50多个国家的70多位驻华使节及夫人们在外交部部长钱其琛和夫人的陪同下，来到北京南郊的大兴县参加第二届西瓜节。
    大兴县是首都重点建设的卫星城，也是主要西瓜产区。这里的西瓜久负盛名。去年开始举办的西瓜节旨在把西瓜交易市场办成乐园，供游人赏瓜、品瓜、购瓜。优秀瓜农可在此设瓜摊、摆擂台。
    钱其琛对使节和夫人们参加西瓜节表示欢迎。他说：“在平息反革命暴乱和中国共产党的十三届四中全会胜利召开之后，你们到北京郊区走走，看看这里的人们在安定的环境下想些什么，干些什么，是怎样工作和生活的，这是很有意义的。”
    在3小时的参观访问中，客人们品尝了西瓜佳品，参观了“西瓜一条街”，还兴致勃勃地前往瓜地摘瓜，每人喜气洋洋地抱回两个大西瓜。他们还参观了北京床单厂。
