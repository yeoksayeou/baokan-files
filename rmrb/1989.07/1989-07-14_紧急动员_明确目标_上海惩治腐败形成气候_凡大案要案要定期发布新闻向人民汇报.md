Shanghai is currently building a strong momentum to combat corruption. At yesterday's meeting of the Municipal Party Committee, Deputy Secretary and Mayor Zhu Rongji called on all Party members in the city to mobilize urgently and seize the opportunity to tackle this matter of life and death for the Party. He said, "As the largest city in the country, Shanghai must take the lead and be even more stringent. We must succeed, not fail. Only in this way can we win the trust of the people."

The following are the urgent tasks currently facing all Party members in the city:

- Further resolving the issue of Party and government officials holding concurrent positions in companies (enterprises). Party and government officials in service are strictly prohibited from holding concurrent positions in companies. Those who are still holding concurrent positions must complete the decoupling procedures by the end of August, leaving no loose ends and no special cases. Retired officials should also strictly follow the relevant documents. For those who delay the process, the disciplinary and supervisory departments at all levels must seriously investigate and hold the legal representatives of the companies and the main responsible persons of the original units accountable.

- Continuing to clean up various types of companies, especially focusing on wholesale companies. Decisive action must be taken to shut down a batch of companies that do not meet the conditions, have no reason to exist, and have serious illegal activities. For important production materials and industrial consumer goods stipulated by the state and the city, no company may wholesale or operate without approval. This work must be completed within the year.

- Focusing on cleaning up large companies that have been the subject of public discussion. Organize relevant departments to thoroughly clean up the nature, tasks, business scope, operational behavior, and development direction of these companies. For the problems found, they must be seriously dealt with: those that should be closed will be closed, and those that should be merged will be merged. Those that continue to operate must operate legally, strictly prohibiting speculation, illegal profiteering, and the internal distribution of the company must be reasonably regulated. The results of the cleanup must be reported to the people of the city.

- Speeding up the trial of the ten major cases of speculation and profiteering that have already been filed. Organize forces to break through as soon as possible. No matter who is involved, or which level of cadres are involved, they must be investigated to the end, daring to remove interference, and not be lenient. Do not use fines instead of the law, and do not use Party discipline and administrative discipline to replace legal discipline. Each unit should self-inspect for any illegal and illegal operations and speculation and profiteering behaviors. Those who truthfully report within August will be treated leniently, otherwise, they will be severely punished once found.

- Speeding up the investigation and handling of embezzlement, bribery, and power-for-profit cases, especially focusing on major cases involving cadres at the bureau level and above. For the major cases that have been cracked, the procuratorial organs must expedite the trial and promptly file a lawsuit with the court. The court should conduct public trials.

The Shanghai Municipal Party Committee pointed out that combating corruption will inevitably encounter various obstacles, so it is necessary to mobilize the masses to report and to ensure the democratic rights of informants. The Municipal Discipline Inspection Commission has drafted the "Provisional Regulations on Giving Party Discipline to Party Organizations and Party Members Who Interfere with the Handling of Disciplinary Cases." Those who intervene and provide false or forged evidence to shield mistakes and interfere with the case will be seriously dealt with once found. For major cases, the truth must be reported to the people through regular news releases. The Municipal Party Committee requires the media to continuously follow up on the reports to strengthen public opinion supervision.

    紧急动员　明确目标
    上海惩治腐败形成气候
    凡大案要案要定期发布新闻向人民汇报
    本报上海七月十四日电　记者章世鸿报道：上海正在形成惩治腐败强大声势。市委副书记、市长朱熔基在昨天召开的市委全体会议上号召全市党员紧急动员起来，不失时机，抓好这件有关党的生死存亡的大事。他说：“上海作为全国最大的城市，要走在前面，要抓得更紧些，只能胜利不能失败。只有这样，才能取信于民。”
    当前摆在全市党员面前的迫切工作有下面几件：
   ——进一步解决党政机关干部在公司（企业）的兼职问题。党政机关在职干部一律不准在公司兼职，如仍在公司兼职的，要在八月底前办完脱钩手续，不留“尾巴”，不搞特批。离退休干部也应严格按照有关文件办理。对拖延不办者，各级纪委、监察部门要严肃查处，并追究公司法人代表和原单位主要负责人的责任。
  ——继续清理各类公司，特别要把专营批发的公司作为清理的重点。要下决心关掉一批条件不具备、没有存在必要和严重违法违章的批发公司。对国家和本市规定的重要生产资料和工业消费品，未经批准，任何公司不得批发或经营。这项工作一定要在年内完成。
   ——重点清理社会议论比较集中的大公司。要组织有关部门对这几家公司的性质任务、业务范围、经营行为和发展方向，认真进行清理。对查出的问题，要严肃处理：该停办的就停办，该合并的就合并；继续办下去的，应依法经营，严禁倒买倒卖，非法牟利，对公司内部分配问题，要作出合理规定，清理结果应向全市人民交代。
  ——抓紧审理已经立案的十大单位投机倒把案件。要组织力量，尽快突破。无论涉及到谁，涉及到哪一级干部，都要一查到底，敢于排除干扰，决不姑息手软。不能以罚代法，不能以党纪、政纪代替法纪。各单位要自查有无违章违法经营，有无投机倒把行为。凡在八月底内如实自报的，可从宽处理，否则一经查实将从严惩处。
   ——加紧查处贪污受贿、以权谋私案件，尤其要查处涉及处以上干部的大案要案。对已破获的大案要案，检察部门要抓紧审结尽快向法院提起公诉。法院要公开审判。
    上海市委指出，惩治腐败必然会遇到各种阻力，因而要发动群众举报，并切实保证举报人的民主权利。市纪委已拟订《关于对干扰查处违纪案件的党组织和党员给予党纪处分的暂行规定》。对说情和提供假证、伪证等包庇错误、干扰办案的，一经查清要严肃处理。凡大案要案，要定期发布新闻向人民汇报真相。市委要求新闻界不断进行跟踪报道，以加强舆论监督。
