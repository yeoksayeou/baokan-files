The second stage (Qiong Lian Cup) of the Chinese Weiqi King's Cup has concluded its seven rounds of competition, but the title of challenger remains undecided. As expected by experts before the tournament, today's matches saw Ma Xiaochun and Qian Yiping both emerge victorious, tying for the top spot.

Qian Yiping's match against the Go Saint Nie Weiping ended first. During the game, Nie, playing black, employed a rare tactic, but it was ineffective and Qian seized the opportunity to strengthen his position. In the middle game, Nie attacked a white group that had not yet been fully developed. Qian responded accurately, securing life for his stones and then exploiting Nie's weaknesses. The game concluded at the 150th move with Qian winning decisively.

In the other match, Ma Xiaochun faced a tough battle. In the opening, Yang Hui, a 7-dan, seemed to intentionally expose a weakness, luring Ma into a fight. By the 40th move, Ma had invaded, and a fierce battle ensued. After more than 30 exchanges, Ma had lost three stones and had a lone group in the middle of the board, facing imminent danger. Unfortunately, Yang, who had the upper hand, hesitated and failed to deliver the final blow. At the 101st move, Yang played a slow move. Because Yang did not immediately secure the white stones, Ma managed to escape and seize a chance to survive. Yang then made another mistake, retreating unnecessarily, allowing Ma to catch his breath and reorganize. By 3 PM, Yang entered the reading time, and Ma learned that Qian Yiping had already won, putting pressure on both players. However, under pressure, Ma maintained his light and agile style, while Yang lost his composure and made several blunders. In the end, Ma turned the tables and won by a margin of one and a quarter points.

Thus, Qian and Ma will have a rapid match to determine the challenger's spot. Additionally, Nie Weiping and Wang Qun, both with three wins and four losses, each with six points, will also have a rapid match to decide the fourth and fifth places in this year's King's Cup. According to the competition rules, the top four players will directly enter the next King's Cup round-robin stage, while the fifth and lower-ranked players will have to participate in an elimination round. To ensure the quality of the competition, the organizers and the hosting company, Hainan Si Chuang Company, decided that these two rapid matches will be held in Beijing after the players have had sufficient rest and recovered their energy.

In today's matches, Yu Bin, an 8-dan, playing white, won against Wang Qun, an 8-dan, securing the third place in this year's King's Cup. Yang Jinhua, a 6-dan, playing white, defeated Cheng Xiaoliu, a 6-dan, by one and a quarter points.

The second stage of the Chinese Weiqi King's Cup has come to an end, and the competition venue has moved back to Beijing from Hainan.

    中国围棋名人战第二阶段七轮角逐结束
    挑战者仍未决出马晓春与钱宇平将加赛快棋
    本报通什7月13日电　记者缪鲁报道：中国围棋名人战第二阶段（琼联杯）的七轮角逐虽已结束，但众矢之的的挑战者称号却束之高阁，未有归属。正如行家赛前所料，在今天的比赛中，马晓春九段和钱宇平九段双双战胜各自的对手，积分仍并列榜首。
    钱宇平对棋圣聂卫平的一盘棋最先结束战斗，在对局中，执黑的聂卫平使出罕见的招数，不想未见成效，反被钱宇平趁势走厚。中盘时，聂向一块未及整形的白棋发起攻击，钱应对无误，干净做活，并借机挤入黑棋苦心经营起的根据地，仅走至第150手便中盘获胜。
    在对局室的另一侧，马晓春则赢得十分艰苦。布局阶段，女七段杨晖似故意露出破绽，诱使马晓春于40手时打入，在上边展开激战，双方交手30余回合，马晓春已三子被歼，并有一块孤棋悬于中腹，危在旦夕。可惜稳操胜券的杨晖面对大好形势，心下犹豫，未能趁热打铁，给对手以最后的致命一击，于101手走出缓着。由于杨晖没有及时罩住白棋的孤棋，马晓春得以出“飞”出绝境，抓住一线生机。接着，杨晖一错再错，白白地低了一路退守，使得马晓春又喘过一口气，重整阵容，展开争夺。当比赛进行到下午3时，杨晖率先进入读秒，而马则得知钱宇平已告胜，积分超过自己，双方都有压力。然而，在压力下，马晓春保持了自己的轻灵风格，杨晖却乱了方寸，又接连走出误着。最后，马晓春起死回生，反败为胜，以一又四分之一子的优势告捷。
    这样，钱、马二人还将加赛快棋以决定挑战权的归属。此外，同样是三胜四负的聂卫平和王群八段，均积六分，也须通过加赛快棋决定本届名人战第四、五名的排列。按照比赛规程，获前4名者可直接进入下届名人战循环圈，第5名以后者则要参加淘汰赛。为了保证比赛的质量，主办者和承办单位海南思创公司研究决定，这两局快棋将待连续苦战的棋手们充分休息、恢复精力后，在北京举行。
    在今天的比赛中，俞斌八段执白中盘胜王群八段，获得本届名人战的第3名；杨晋华六段执白胜程晓流六段一又四分之一子。
    中国围棋名人战第二阶段告一段落，赛场由海南移回北京。
