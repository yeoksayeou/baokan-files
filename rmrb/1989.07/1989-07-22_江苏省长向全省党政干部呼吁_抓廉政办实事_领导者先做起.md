Jiangsu Provincial Governor Appeals to Party and Government Officials to Focus on Integrity and Practical Work, Leaders Should Lead by Example

Nanjing, July 22 (Xinhua) — "Currently, the issues that the public discusses the most and has the strongest reactions to are twofold: one is the excessive inflation and price increases; the other is the issues of official profiteering, corruption, and social inequity in distribution. To win the hearts of the people, we must focus on solving these two problems and work diligently to achieve practical results." This appeal was made by Chen Huanyou, Deputy Secretary of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Committee and Governor, to all party and government officials in the province.

The reporter noticed that during the Jiangsu Provincial Mayors' Conference held from July 15 to 17, all attendees adhered to the conference subsidy standards and had a meal of "four dishes and one soup." Chen Huanyou, who had recently taken office as the provincial governor, and other vice governors dined with everyone in the same dining hall and at the same table, breaking away from the past practice of provincial-level leaders dining in small dining rooms.

At this conference, Governor Chen Huanyou first demanded that leading cadres at all levels of the leadership organs start immediately and from themselves to maintain the integrity and honesty that communists should have. When leading cadres go to work, they must not accept banquets paid for with public funds. Strictly prohibit officials from using their power for personal gain in housing construction and purchase. At the same time, all levels of organs are strictly prohibited from buying luxury cars, and if updates are needed, domestic cars should be purchased.

Next, to eliminate the social foundations of corruption and social inequity in distribution, continue to clean up companies and rectify the circulation order. Since August of last year, Jiangsu Province has revoked 676 companies run by party and government organs or officials, and 2,200 party and government cadres (including retired cadres) who held concurrent positions in companies, except for 6 who can continue to hold concurrent positions according to regulations, all others have resigned from their concurrent positions. The 39 branches of the Kanghua Company in Jiangsu Province have been revoked, with 34 of them already shut down.

### 江苏省长向全省党政干部呼吁  抓廉政办实事　领导者先做起

    江苏省长向全省党政干部呼吁
    抓廉政办实事　领导者先做起
    本报南京7月22日电　记者孙健报道：“现在，群众议论最多，反映最强烈的问题：一个是通货膨胀、物价上涨幅度过大；一个是官倒、腐败和社会分配不公。要取得民心，就必须围绕着解决这两个问题，扎扎实实办实事。”中共江苏省委副书记、省长陈焕友向全省党政干部发出上述呼吁。
    记者注意到，在本月15日至17日召开的江苏省市长会议上，与会同志一律按会议补贴标准吃“四菜一汤”，刚刚担任省长不久的陈焕友和其他副省长与大家同餐厅同桌就餐，一改过去省级领导同志在小餐厅就餐的做法。
    在这次会议上，陈焕友省长首先要求各级领导机关的领导干部从现在做起，从自身做起，保持共产党人应有的清正廉洁。领导干部下去工作，不准接受用公款开支的宴请。坚决制止干部在建房、购房中的以权谋私行为。同时，要求各级机关一律不准再买豪华小汽车，需要更新的就买国产车。
    其次，铲除腐败和社会分配不公的社会基础，继续清理公司，整顿流通秩序。江苏省从去年8月以来已撤销党政机关公司或干部办的公司676个，兼任公司职务的2200名党政干部（含离退休干部），除6名按规定可继续兼职的以外，其余的均已辞去一头职务。康华公司在江苏省的39个分支机构，已撤销34个。
