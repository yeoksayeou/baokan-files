    Self-Surrender Leads to Lenient Treatment
    Wuhan Prosecutors Drop Charges Against Two Bribery Suspects

    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 30th – (Reporter Fang Zhengjun, Correspondent Fang Jiamu) The Jianghan District People's Procuratorate in Wuhan held a press conference yesterday, announcing that two major bribery suspects who voluntarily surrendered and actively returned the stolen goods would be exempted from prosecution in accordance with the law. So far, nine economic criminals have surrendered to the authorities.

    Zhou Wen'ge, former deputy director of the Multifunctional Vehicle Factory of Wuhan Bicycle Factory, used his position from July 1987 to April 1989 to sell steel materials and high-frequency welded pipes allocated by higher authorities and purchased in the name of the factory to other units. He accepted bribes six times totaling 11,210 yuan, a large amount, and his criminal acts were relatively serious, constituting the crime of accepting bribes. Zhou Wen'ge, without the party organization or procuratorial organs knowing his criminal facts, voluntarily confessed to the party organization of his unit and, accompanied by the unit's leaders, surrendered to the procuratorial organs. He immediately returned all the illicit gains, showing signs of repentance.

    Tu Shaobo, former secretary of the Party Committee and deputy manager of Wuhan Water Transport Company (a deputy bureau-level cadre), was intimidated by the power of the law and the public's denunciations. In May of this year, he voluntarily surrendered to the procuratorial organs and confessed to using his position to accept bribes and, under the guise of "borrowing," embezzle public funds and sell steel for profit, totaling over 14,000 yuan in economic issues. He also returned the illicit gains and the original records of obtaining the illicit gains.

    投案自首得到从宽处理
    武汉对两名受贿案犯免予起诉
    新华社武汉7月30日电  （记者方政军、通讯员方家木）武汉市江汉区人民检察院昨天召开新闻发布会，宣布对主动投案自首、积极还赃的两名重大受贿案犯依法免予起诉。目前已有9名经济犯罪人员前来投案自首。
    原武汉自行车一厂多功能车厂副厂长周文革，在任职期间，于1987年7月至1989年4月，利用职务之便，将上级调拨给这个厂用于生产的钢材和以车厂名义联系购得的19高频焊管等生产原材料转售给其他单位，先后6次收受贿赂共11210余元，数额巨大，犯罪情节比较严重，已构成收受贿赂罪。周文革在单位党组织和检察机关没有掌握他的犯罪事实的情况下，主动向单位党组织坦白交待并在单位领导陪同下到检察机关投案自首，当即退出全部赃款，有悔改的表现。
    原武汉市水运公司党委书记、副经理涂少波（正处级干部）慑于法律的威力和群众举报的声威，于今年5月向检察机关投案自首，坦白交待了他在任职期间利用职务之便先后收受贿赂和以“借”为名侵吞公款、倒卖钢材牟利等得利总共14000余元的经济问题，并退出赃款和获取赃款的原始记录。
