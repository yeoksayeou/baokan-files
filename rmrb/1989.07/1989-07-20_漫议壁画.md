Murals, for architecture, are like attaching a precious brooch to an ordinary piece of clothing. Although people may not always notice them, this decorative art form and its artistic effect of adding the final touch will undoubtedly add splendor to people's lives.

Murals in our country have a long history. A mural with a distinct personality and artistic depth, standing for hundreds of years, will retain its original artistic appreciation value. The Nine Dragon Wall in Datong, Shanxi Province, built during the 25th year of the Hongwu reign of the Ming Dynasty (1392), is the oldest and largest mural still existing in China. This mural, composed of specially made glazed bricks, features nine large dragons dancing in vast waves, with vigorous expressions and lively postures, appearing lifelike. The colors of the dragons are yellow, blue, reddish-brown, purple, and white, creating a vibrant and varied effect. The nine dragons, reflected in the pool water, seem to be swimming in the sea, imbued with a strong sense of mythology. For centuries, people have appreciated it as a magnificent work of architectural art and culture.

The Nine Dragon Wall in Beihai Park was built during the 21st year of the Qianlong reign of the Qing Dynasty. It is said to be a replica of the Nine Dragon Wall in Datong. This wall is 5 meters high and 27 meters long, with both sides made of seven-colored glazed tiles depicting nine coiling dragons playing with pearls among waves and clouds. This glazed tile masterpiece adorns the imperial "garden," seamlessly integrating Chinese gardens, architecture, and the environment, creating a beautiful landscape for modern people to enjoy and visit.

Early murals in China were mostly used on the back walls of mansions. With the development of architecture and cultural arts, murals gradually became an indispensable art form in buildings, finding increasingly more applications. Designers use murals, wall ceramics, and reliefs to decorate the interiors and exteriors of various buildings, adding layers and breaking the monotony of the past, making them more aesthetically pleasing and colorful.

In the East 40th Street subway station, known for its exemplary three-dimensional transportation and the integration of architectural art with functionality, two striking large-scale ceramic inlaid murals, "The Glory of China" and "Marching Towards the World," adorn the east and west walls, making the station vibrant and colorful. The first mural is 3 meters high and 62 meters long, depicting nearly a hundred Chinese warriors wielding swords, spears, and whips, riding horses and charging forward. The second mural is 2.99 meters high and 70 meters long, featuring various sports scenes such as gymnastics, swimming, and shooting, with athletes in beautiful and coordinated poses, and unique, exquisite colors. It fully reflects the tenacious struggle and global presence of contemporary Chinese athletes, symbolizing the Chinese nation's firm steps towards the world. The artistic effect of the murals is perfectly combined with the station's architectural decoration.

German designer Jürgen in Dortmund designed a mural on the wall of the Telecommunications Building based on the shape of two postage stamps. The mural, emerging from the bare wall, is intriguing and thought-provoking. The colorful wires on the mural connect the stamps, creating a harmonious and radiant effect, symbolizing postal connections to all directions. This architectural art not only looks beautiful but also maintains perfect harmony with the building's style.

The large-scale ceramic relief mural in the Fengfeng Mining District of Handan City is composed of 976 ceramic tiles, standing 2.8 meters high and 42.7 meters long. The mural is based on local legends from the Black Dragon Cave at the source of the Hongyang River, featuring three scenes: "Dragon Cave Spring," "Jasmine Girl," and "Erlang Carrying the Mountain." It meticulously depicts 23 lifelike figures, with magical colors and a strong sense of life. The completion of this mural not only enhances the aesthetic appeal of the mining area but also seamlessly integrates the mural with the undulating, varied architecture of the new mining district, truly a work of ingenuity that leaves viewers breathless.

Artists believe that the colorful and diverse murals embedded in buildings, like seasoning added to food, meet people's high aesthetic demands for architecture and increase the allure of cities. They bring art appreciation from the galleries of art museums to stations, streets, and public places, creating opportunities for more people to understand and appreciate art.

    漫议壁画
    米祥友
    壁画对建筑来说，犹如在极其普通衣服上别了一枚珍贵的胸花，虽然有时人们不太注意它，但这装饰艺术形式和具有画龙点睛作用的艺术效果，必定会给人们生活增添绚丽的光彩。
    壁画在我国的历史源远流长，一幅具有鲜明个性和艺术深度的壁画矗立几百年，其艺术欣赏价值会不改初衷。始建于明洪武二十五年（1392年）的山西大同城内高8米、长45.5米的九龙壁，是我国现存最早最大的壁画。这幅由特制琉璃砖组成的九条大龙图案，飞舞在浩瀚波涛之中，神情雄健，姿态活泼，栩栩如生，加之龙的颜色分别为黄、蓝、赭、紫、白，五彩缤纷，参差有致，九条大龙在池水的照映下，如同在海中遨游一般，富有浓厚的神话感。几百年来，人们都将其作为巨大建筑艺术和文化作品来进行欣赏。
    北海九龙壁建于清乾隆二十一年，相传是仿大同九龙壁而建造的，该壁高5米、长27米，壁的双面均由七彩琉璃雕制成的蟠龙九条，戏珠于波涛云气之间。这一琉璃杰作点缀了皇家“御苑”，并使中国园林与建筑和环境巧妙地融为一体，形成风景优美和现代人们的流连欣赏游憩胜地。
    我国早期的壁画大多用于府门的照壁，随着建筑和文化艺术的发展，壁画慢慢开始成为建筑物上不可缺少的艺术，得到越来越多的应用。设计师们采用壁画、墙用美术陶瓷和浮雕装饰各种建筑的内部或外表，增加了建筑物的层次，一改以往千篇一律的单调感，使之具有较强的美感和多姿多彩的面孔。
    在被誉为是立体交通的典范、建筑艺术与使用功能融为一体的东四十条地铁车站东西侧墙面上，两幅赫然醒目的巨型陶瓷镶嵌壁画《华夏雄风》和《走向世界》，将车站装点得异彩绚丽。前幅高3米、长62米，画面上近百名中华健儿挥刀劈杀、挺矛冲刺、跃马扬鞭；后幅高2.99米、长70米，分别为各类体操、游泳、射击等竞技画面和体态优美协调、色彩独特精美的图案，充分反映了当代中华体育健儿顽强拚搏、走向世界的雄姿，寓意着中华民族正以坚定的步伐走向世界。使壁画艺术效果与站台建筑装饰完美地结合起来。
    联邦德国于尔根先生在多特蒙德市电讯大楼墙面上设计以两张邮票造型为基础的壁画，画面在光秃秃的墙体上呼之欲出，耐人寻味，壁画上花花绿绿的导线连结着邮票，左右呼应，相映生辉，象征着邮政连结四面八方。这一建筑物上的艺术，不仅看上去美观，而且与建筑风格保持完美的和谐一致。
    邯郸市峰峰矿区落成的大型陶瓷浮雕壁画，由976块陶瓷方砖拼制而成，高2.8米、长42.7米，壁画取材于滏阳河源头黑龙洞的民间传说，画面为“龙洞珠泉”、“茉莉姑娘”和“二郎担山”三幅图案，细致的刻画了23个栩栩如生的人物形象，具有神奇的色彩和浓郁的生活气息。这一壁画的落成，不仅增加了矿区环境的美感，并使壁画与新型矿区高低起伏、错落有致的建筑浑然一体，真可谓别具匠心，使人目不暇接。
    艺术家们认为：镶嵌在建筑物上多姿多彩、五花十色的艺术壁画，恰似人们加在食物上的佐料，是满足人们对建筑美感上的高度要求和增加城市的诱惑力，将人们艺术欣赏从美术馆的画廊，引上车站、街头和公共场所，创造条件，有更多的机会了解和接融艺术。
