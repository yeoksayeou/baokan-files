Wang Wensheng has been working in road maintenance and toll collection for 32 years. Some people praise him to no end, while others curse him behind his back. Whether praised or cursed, Wang Wensheng stands tall and continues on his path.

At 59 years old, Wang Wensheng is the head of the road maintenance fee collection team in the Fengqiu County Highway Section in Henan Province. Don't underestimate this minor "road official." Whether to impound a vehicle that hasn't paid the road maintenance fee, whether to fine it, and how much to fine, all depend on his decision. For some people, a mere nod or wink could bring them benefits. However, Wang Wensheng has angered almost everyone who tried to pull strings with him on this "lucrative" job.

Those who are most upset with Wang Wensheng are his relatives and friends. Last March, his nephew drove a car that was reported as stopped for maintenance to transport goods, and was caught by Wang Wensheng. Seeing no one around, the nephew quietly asked his uncle, "Can you let it go if I pay the road maintenance fee?" Wang Wensheng loudly replied, "No. There's also a 10% fine." The nephew asked again, "Can you reduce the fine a bit?" Wang Wensheng answered, "No. It has to be according to the policy." The nephew got angry and said, "I'll pay the fine, but can you let the car go now?" Wang Wensheng calmly replied, "Then I need to see the receipt." The nephew had no choice but to pay the road maintenance fee and the fine according to the receipt.

Over the years, whenever a car is impounded, the phone calls and notes come pouring in. Visitors flock to his office. Wang Wensheng treats these visitors, no matter how high their rank, with the same indifference. Once, a relative of a high-ranking official had their car impounded. The official wrote a note asking for "consideration." Wang Wensheng glanced at it and tore the note into pieces, throwing it on the ground. The visitor saw this and turned pale with anger. Not long after, the official himself called Wang Wensheng, demanding, "Who's rank is higher, yours or mine? Do you lead me or do I lead you?" Wang Wensheng, suppressing his anger, firmly replied, "In terms of rank, of course you are higher; in terms of leadership, of course you lead me. However, if I let the car go for one person who intercedes, I have to let it go for another who intercedes. Will we still collect the road maintenance fee? Will we still maintain our roads? Will we build them or not?" These words left the official speechless.

Of course, there have been people who privately advised Wang Wensheng not to be so stubborn, not to be so absolute in his actions, lest he cut off all his paths. However, Wang Wensheng still insists on collecting fees according to the law without favoritism.

    依法收费不徇私情
    ——记封丘县公路段王文生
    周道安
    王文生干养路收费32年，有人赞不绝口，有人背后骂娘。夸也好，骂也罢，王文生挺胸昂首，依然走自己的路。
    今年59岁的王文生是河南省封丘县公路段养路费征收组负责人。甭小看这么个不上等级的小小“路官”，不买养路费的车辆扣不扣，罚不罚，罚多少，全凭他一锤定音。对某些人来讲，只要嘴一歪，头一点，好处自会滚滚而来。但王文生却在这个“肥差”上，惹恼过几乎所有找他开“后门”的人。
    对王文生最有气的，莫过于他的亲朋好友。去年3月，他外甥偷开报停的车子搞运输，硬是被王文生扣下。眼见四下无人，外甥悄悄问舅舅：“补交养路费放车不？”王文生大声说：“不放。还有10％的罚款。”他外甥又问：“少罚几个中不？”王文生回答：“不中。得照政策来？”他外甥一听来了火：“我认罚，现在放不放车？”王文生不紧不慢回答：“那我也得见发票。”外甥无奈，只好按票交了养路费和罚款。
    这些年，只要一台车被扣，等着瞧吧，电话、条子不断。说客盈门。王文生对待说客，不论是多大的官，统统不买账。一次，有个领导干部亲戚家的车子被扣，这位领导干部写条子让“照顾”一下。王文生刚瞧两眼，便“嚓嚓”将字条撕个粉碎，“唰”地一下子甩到地上。来人一见这势头，气得一下灰了脸。没过多久，这位领导亲自打电话把王文生喊去，劈头就问：“是你的官大还是我的官大？是你领导我还是我领导你？”王文生强压住心火，不软不硬地反驳说：“论官当然是你大；论领导当然是你领导我。但是，如果这个出面讲情我放车，那个出面讲情我也放车，养路费到底还收不收？咱们的公路到底还养不养？建不建？”一席话，说得这个领导没了词。
    当然喽！也曾有人私下劝王文生脾气不要那么倔，办事不要那么绝，免得把路都断了。可是，王文生还是照样依法收费不徇私情。
