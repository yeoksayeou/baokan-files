U.S. business leaders have called on the Bush administration to "do everything possible" to maintain U.S.-China economic relations and oppose new sanctions against China.

According to a report by the U.S. *Business Daily*, representatives from the U.S. Exporters Association, the U.S.-China Business Council, and the U.S. Manufacturers Association testified at a joint hearing of three subcommittees of the House Foreign Affairs Committee on July 19. They unanimously opposed the proposal by some congressional members to revoke China's most-favored-nation trading status.

Chairman of the Trade Policy Committee of the U.S. Exporters Association, Handal, testified that China's most-favored-nation trading status is "the cornerstone of U.S.-China trade relations." He said that revoking this status would "seriously harm the interests of many U.S. companies that depend on trade for their survival."

Vice Chairman of the U.S. Manufacturers Association, Lewis, pointed out that U.S. sanctions do not affect the policies and behaviors of foreign countries; they only create problems for U.S. relations with these countries and make the U.S. industrial sector appear to be an "unreliable supplier" in the world.

Lewis said that on the issue of sanctions against China, U.S. officials "must consider the crucial political, economic, strategic, and intelligence issues simultaneously."

He said that maintaining U.S. commercial presence in China is in the long-term interests of the United States. If U.S. export-import banks are prohibited from providing financing for U.S.-China trade activities, nearly $500 million in export-import trade would be affected.

He believed that "suspending the export of high-technology products to China would result in nearly $2 billion in losses for U.S. exports and, in reality, would not prevent China from obtaining these products from other countries."

Vice Chairman of the U.S.-China Business Council, Gillespie, also emphasized the importance of maintaining U.S.-China economic relations in his testimony.

    美工商界人士呼吁布什政府
    努力维护美中经济关系
    反对对中国采取新制裁
    新华社华盛顿7月20日电  美国一些工商界人士19日呼吁布什政府“尽最大努力”维护美中经济关系，反对对中国采取新的制裁措施。
    据美国《商业日报》报道，美国进出口商协会、美中商务委员会及美国制造商协会的代表昨天在众议院外委会的三个小组委员会联合举行的听证会作证时，一致反对少数国会议员要求取消给中国贸易最惠国待遇的主张。
    美国进出口商协会贸易政策委员会主席汉达尔在作证时说，中国的贸易最惠国待遇是
  “美中贸易关系的基石”，取消给予中国的这种待遇将会“严重损害美国许多依赖贸易而生存的公司”的利益。
    美国制造商协会副主席刘易斯指出，美国的制裁措施影响不了外国的政策和行为，它只能给美国与这些国家的关系带来麻烦，并使美国工业界在世界上被认为是“不可靠的供应者”。
    刘易斯说：在对中国实行制裁的问题上，美国官员“必须同时顾及至关重要的政治和经济、战略和情报等问题”。
    他说，美国在中国保持商业机构是符合美国长远利益的。如果禁止美国的进出口银行为美中贸易活动提供资助，就将会使近5亿美元的进出口贸易受到影响。
    他认为，“中止向中国出口高技术产品会使美国的出口贸易损失近20亿美元，并且在实际上也不可能阻止中国从其它国家得到这些产品。
    美中商务委员会副主席吉莱斯皮在作证时也强调了维护美中经济关系的重要性。
