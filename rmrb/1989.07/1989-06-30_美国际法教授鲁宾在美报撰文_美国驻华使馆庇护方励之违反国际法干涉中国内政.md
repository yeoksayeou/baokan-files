	American international law professor Alfred Rubin today published an article in *The Christian Science Monitor*, arguing that the U.S. Embassy in China sheltering Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian is an interference in China's internal affairs and a violation of internationally recognized legal principles.

	The article states, "On June 8, President Bush asserted in a press conference that the U.S. Embassy in China sheltering Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian is legal because Fang's life is threatened. Obviously, this 'threat' refers to the fact that the Chinese government is about to enforce a law on its territory against a Chinese citizen that we do not like. The U.S. diplomatic mission justifies its actions by claiming that this person's life is in danger, saying that it is legal to open its doors to the victim of this law. This explanation is erroneous."

	The article continues, "It is in accordance with humanitarian principles for some people to seek refuge from mobs or other illegal actions. Obviously, this principle does not apply to the Fang Lizhi case." "The international law regarding these matters is particularly clear. The relevant case can be found in the 1956 decision of the International Court of Justice. At that time, a leader of the Peruvian Revolutionary American People's Alliance, Ayala de la Torre, fled to the Colombian Embassy in Peru after a failed coup. The International Court of Justice ruled that Peru was not bound by any treaty in this matter, 'the decision to grant diplomatic asylum... makes the criminal immune from the judicial jurisdiction of the territorial state, thereby constituting an intervention in matters entirely within the jurisdiction of that state.' As a result, Colombia lost the case. Undoubtedly, this famous case still correctly illustrates the common law of nations today."

	"The People's Republic of China and the United States are both signatories to the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. According to the provisions of this convention, only dispatched diplomatic personnel and their families enjoy diplomatic immunity. Nationals of the receiving state who are not diplomatic personnel but are employed by the diplomatic mission can only enjoy this immunity if recognized by the receiving state. Fang Lizhi is not such an employee."

	The article concludes, "Now, let us examine whether the U.S. sheltering Fang Lizhi and his family is also an illegal interference in China's affairs? Since only diplomatic mission personnel enjoy immunity under international law, Fang Lizhi and his family do not enjoy this right, and therefore the U.S. cannot demand that this immunity also applies to them."

    美国际法教授鲁宾在美报撰文
    美国驻华使馆庇护方励之违反国际法干涉中国内政
    本报联合国6月28日电　记者刘开宸报道：美国塔夫茨大学国际法教授阿尔弗雷德·鲁宾今天在《基督教科学箴言报》上发表文章，认为美国驻华使馆庇护方励之、李淑娴是干涉中国内政，违反了公认的国际法准则。
    文章说，“布什总统在6月8日记者招待会上断言，美国驻华大使馆庇护方励之及其妻李淑娴是合法的，因为方先生的生命受到威胁。显然，此‘威胁’是指接受美国外交使团的一个中国政府将要在中国领土上对一个中国人执行一项我们不喜欢的法律。美国使团就以这个人的生命危险来为其行为辩解，说它对此项法律的受害者开放是合法的。这种解释是谬误的。”
    文章说，“一些人如为了逃避暴徒或其他非法行动，受到外交庇护是合乎人道主义原则的。很显然，此原则对方励之案件并不适合。”“关于这些事务的国际法是特别清楚的。有关的案例见之于世界法庭1956年的决定。那时，秘鲁的美洲人民革命联盟一位领导者阿亚·德拉托雷在政变失败后逃到哥伦比亚驻秘鲁大使馆避难。世界法庭认为，秘鲁不受这方面事务任何条约的约束，‘给予外交避难的决定……使罪犯不受领土国的司法制裁，因而形成了对完全是那个国家权限内事务的一种干涉’。结果，哥伦比亚败诉了。毫无疑问，这一著名案例今天仍正确地说明国际的共同法律。”
    “中华人民共和国和美国都是1961年《维也纳外交关系公约》的参加国。根据此条约规定，只有被派遣的外交人员及其家属才享受外交豁免权，不是外交人员、但是受外交使团雇用的接受国国民，只有得到接受国承认时，才可享受此豁免权。而方励之也并非这类雇员。”
    该文说：“现在，我们来看，美国庇护方励之及其家属是否也非法地干涉了中国事务？既然，只有外交使团的人根据国际法才享有豁免权，方励之及其家属不享有这种权利，因而美国不能要求它享受的豁免权也适用于他们。”
