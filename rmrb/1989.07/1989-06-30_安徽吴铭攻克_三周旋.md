Not long ago, the extremely difficult acrobatic solo jump maneuver known as the "triple somersault" was being called for by both the acrobatics community and the media. Recently, this feat has been successfully conquered by Anhui Province's acrobatic athlete, Wu Ming.

The 23-year-old Wu Ming began practicing this super-difficult maneuver after the conclusion of this year's National Acrobatics Championships in May. Apart from Chinese athlete Feng Tao, who used this maneuver in a national competition in 1987, to date, no one in the world's acrobatics community has been able to incorporate the "triple somersault" into an official competition.

    安徽吴铭攻克“三周旋”
    据新华社合肥6月28日电　（记者郭庆华）前不久还在被技巧界和新闻界发出“呼唤”的技巧单人跳跃超难动作“三周旋”，近日已由安徽省技巧选手吴铭奋力攻克。
    23岁的吴铭是在今年5月的全国技巧锦标赛结束之后开始学习这个超难动作的。除我国选手冯涛1987年曾把这个动作用于全国比赛之外，迄今为止，在世界技巧界中还没有一人能把“三周旋”用于正式比赛。
