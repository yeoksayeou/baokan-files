Why did "Voice of America" enthusiastically support the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in Beijing? If we briefly review history, we will know that this is another malicious performance of American interference in China's internal affairs, and a rehash of the "peaceful evolution" strategy pursued by anti-communist elements within the American monopoly capitalist class.

Marxism has long told us that the scientific socialist ideological system and social system, as the antithesis of the capitalist ideological system and social system, once born, heralded the inevitable decline of the entire capitalist system and its ultimate replacement by the socialist system. This is determined by the internal contradictions and laws of modern society, an inevitable historical process that does not depend on human will. Therefore, the establishment, consolidation, perfection, and development of the socialist system in any country strike a blow and pose a threat to the capitalist wage labor system. Although people of various countries choose their way of life and social system according to the objective laws of social historical development, this is entirely a just cause within the sovereign jurisdiction of their own countries. However, anti-communist elements within the international bourgeoisie always attempt to alternately use the strategies of violent overthrow and "peaceful evolution" to strangle and eliminate the newly born socialist system. We need not mention that after the victory of the "October Revolution," the reactionary armed intervention of the Western fourteen countries attempted to strangle the newly born Soviet Russia in its "red cradle"; nor need we mention that thirty-nine years ago, the United States waged the Korean War, sent the Seventh Fleet to occupy the Taiwan Strait, and used trade embargoes, economic blockades, and subsequent hundreds of provocative incursions into our territorial waters and airspace to attempt to violently overthrow socialist China. Here, we need to recall that when the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, relied on hard work and arduous struggle to establish a firm foothold for the socialist system on Chinese soil, achieved a solid foundation for the socialist cause, and greatly enhanced China's international prestige, even after the two countries made efforts to establish diplomatic relations in 1972, some anti-communist elements in the United States still harbored the dream of pursuing a "peaceful evolution" strategy against China, hoping to realize their goal of overthrowing the socialist system on some future day.

Adopting the "peaceful evolution" strategy is a strategic shift made by anti-communist elements in the American government and society after failing in military intervention or when social and historical conditions make military intervention an unrealistic choice. From forty years ago with Acheson to the Dulles era of the 1950s, and to the actions of some anti-communist forces in the United States today, this reflects the historical trajectory of this strategic shift.

The former U.S. Secretary of State Acheson was the initiator of the "peaceful evolution" strategy against China. In mid-1949, the victory of the People's Liberation War, in which the Chinese people resisted the U.S. funding and arming of the Kuomintang to fight against the Chinese people, was already a fait accompli and irreversible. After the failure of military intervention, on the eve of the publication of the "White Paper" on "U.S.-China Relations" in August of that year, Acheson proposed in a letter to President Truman on July 20 the strategy of encouraging and supporting China's "democratic individualists," attempting to make China "peacefully evolve" into a capitalist country. He said in the letter: "We still believe that, no matter how tragic the situation in China may be in the near future, no matter how a major part of China's vast population may be cruelly exploited by a party serving the interests of a foreign imperialism, China's ancient civilization and democratic individualism will rise again, and China will overthrow the foreign shackles. I think we should encourage all developments in China that are now or will be working towards this goal." Obviously, the "imperialism" referred to by Acheson here is the Soviet Union, and the "party" refers to the Communist Party of China. The main point of Acheson's slanderous words is to propose a strategy of "encouraging" China's "democratic individualists" to carry out "peaceful evolution" from within, aiming to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and topple the people's government. Due to the fact that during that time and for a period afterward, the United States' main policy towards China was one of open hostility and military aggression and threats, the strategy of "peaceful evolution" was not yet their dominant strategic idea.

It was during the Dulles era that "peaceful evolution" began to be seen as the main strategy for fighting against socialist countries. From the late 1940s to the mid-1950s, the socialist system, following the Soviet Union, was firmly established in China and other people's democratic countries, and began to show vigorous vitality. During this period, the U.S. war in Korea also ended in failure. Obviously, attempting to mainly use force to overthrow socialist countries was no longer feasible and was a foolish and unpopular act. Therefore, they had to change their strategy, that is, to use "peaceful evolution" as the main strategic principle to deal with socialist countries. In the mid-1950s, then U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, in a policy statement after China implemented the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," openly declared that the U.S. policy was to promote the liberalization (i.e., liberalization or capitalist transformation) of the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and China, and to place hope in the third and fourth generations of these countries. The so-called "promotion" of the "liberalization" of these socialist countries was to instigate and cooperate with the residual capitalist forces within these countries to carry out "peaceful evolution," gradually transforming socialist societies into capitalist societies. Therefore, the name "Dulles" also became synonymous with "peaceful evolution." However, in the 1960s and 1970s, due to the fact that the United States and some Western countries mainly pursued the policy of "brinkmanship" and "Cold War," the resulting escalating arms race and the tense international situation between East and West made it impossible for them to fully implement their principle of "peaceful evolution."

Entering the 1980s, in the eyes of some anti-communist elements in the American government and society, this was an excellent opportunity for them to carry out "peaceful evolution." Because since World War II, Western capitalist countries have seen rapid development in modern science and technology and a rapid expansion of social and economic forces in this peaceful environment, and social and class contradictions have been partially adjusted and eased. Therefore, the capitalist world has accumulated relative advantages in economics and technology. At the same time, some socialist countries, due to various complex reasons, have suffered setbacks to varying degrees in social and economic issues. While the socialist cause has achieved great success, it has also encountered some new problems and difficulties in its progress. One of the universal causes is that rigid and outdated economic and political systems have shown various shortcomings, thus hindering the full play of the superiority of socialism, obstructing the development of productive forces, the relatively rapid improvement of people's living standards, and the full development of socialist democracy. Therefore, since the late 1970s, China and other socialist countries have successively begun comprehensive socialist system reforms. In the eyes of Marxists, these reforms are the self-improvement and development of the socialist system itself. However, in the eyes of some anti-communist and anti-socialist elements in the West, the reforms of socialist countries are precisely the opportunity of a lifetime for them to instigate these countries to carry out "peaceful evolution." Meanwhile, the trend of détente between East and West also provided convenient conditions for them to implement this strategic principle in the increasingly expanded East-West exchanges.

We must be vigilant against the two-pronged approach of some American anti-communist elements towards socialist countries:

One approach is to use economic aid and technology transfer as a means to lure socialist countries into a trap or to exert pressure to force them to carry out "peaceful evolution" in economics and politics. For countries that do not want to carry out "peaceful evolution," they do not provide "substantive aid," or they provide some aid first and then use "debt collection" and other economic means to force them to comply. Regarding this, Fang Lizhi, as a traitor to the Chinese nation, is well versed in the intentions of his foreign masters. He once advised the bosses on Wall Street that on the issue of which path China should take, foreigners should exert pressure on the Chinese government and withdraw investments in China. As a prerequisite for this, in the short term, both stimulation and avoidance of escalation to the point of complete self-reliance should be achieved, and in the short term, through foreign investment in China, when "China's dependence on foreign investment increases," that is, when "economic factors become increasingly important in the relationship between the international community and China," it will be easy to... what will be easy, Mr. Fang hinted but did not say. In fact, it is self-evident that he wants to use Western economic pressure to achieve their long-cherished goal of carrying out "peaceful evolution" in China, that is, to achieve "complete Westernization." Of course, in China's economic relations with foreign countries, we should not throw the baby out with the bathwater. On the premise of equality, mutual benefit, and no political conditions, we should still expand economic exchanges with the outside world and still try to attract more foreign investment and strengthen technological cooperation. But at the same time, we should be vigilant against those who are plotting the conspiracy of "peaceful evolution."

As for the other approach we should be vigilant against, it is their use of bourgeois ideology, that is, using American-style freedom, democracy, and human rights concepts as spiritual weapons to infiltrate and penetrate socialist countries, and using them to instigate and support a small number of people within our country who insist on the bourgeois liberalization stance to undermine the socialist system from within.

Marxists have always believed that bourgeois ideology, which takes abstract freedom, democracy, and human rights as its banner, played an active role in the struggle against feudal autocracy. But in essence, it is a reflection of the bourgeois wage labor system and bourgeois interests in ideology. It, as the ruling ideology in that society, has gained social legitimacy and been endowed with abstract universality, so it is monolithic and serves the capitalist economic base. Under the socialist system, the concepts of freedom, democracy, and rights of the proletariat have transformed and sublated the negative elements in bourgeois ideological consciousness, and there is a fundamental difference between the two. Here, socialist democratic consciousness and institutions represent the fundamental interests and will of the working class and the laboring people, and are the political and ideological superstructure that matches the socialist economic structure. Therefore, under the socialist system, we should develop socialist concepts of democracy, freedom, and rights; if in a socialist society, to realize bourgeois-style democracy, freedom, and human rights, it will necessarily undermine the socialist system itself. However, some bourgeois ideologues and followers, in order to let bourgeois ideological consciousness gain some legitimacy in socialist society and use it as a tool for "peaceful evolution," insist on saying that it is "pluralistic." Therefore, the "political pluralization reform" hoped for by Western anti-communist elements in socialist society is nothing more than a covert term for their "peaceful evolution." Even the leader of the "High Autonomy Federation," Wang Dan, is aware of this. Wang Dan once told a classmate at Peking University: their "lowest goal" in causing trouble was to fight for the recognition of the legitimacy of the "High Autonomy Federation," to rehabilitate Fang Lizhi, and to establish private newspapers; while their "highest goal" was to "establish a multi-party system and realize elite politics."

Therefore, it should be said that the struggle between some people at home and abroad to carry out "peaceful evolution" in China and the Chinese people's resistance to "peaceful evolution" is not only a special form of class struggle within the international arena but also a manifestation of class struggle within a certain range of Chinese society. Because within the country, carrying out "peaceful evolution" also has a thin social base. In Chinese society, including the intellectual community, and even within the Communist Party, there are still a few people who envy the capitalist system. If the "democratic individualists" of yesteryears were only some intermediaries who had illusions about the United States and some misunderstandings about the Communist Party, then today's China has some stubborn adherents of the bourgeois liberalization stance who are reactionary elements who bow down to Western civilization and fervently oppose the socialist system. Like Fang Lizhi, Wang Dan, Liu Xiaobo, and the like, they are not only fervent anti-communists and anti-socialists but also traitors to the Chinese nation. They are full of servility, worship Western culture, and collude with foreign anti-communist forces, working in concert to create chaos and riots in China, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, subvert the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic to establish a bourgeois republic dependent on the West. Fang Lizhi and his ilk are the echo of American anti-communist elements' attempt to carry out "peaceful evolution" in China.

It is precisely for this reason that "Voice of America" has reached the point of losing all sense of reason and becoming reckless in its incitement and support for the turmoil and riots that occurred in Beijing. People remember that during the U.S. president's visit to China this spring, the "dinner incident" directed by the U.S. Embassy in China, in which Fang Lizhi was involved, was obviously a blatant support for Fang Lizhi's brewing of trouble in China. During this period of turmoil and riots, "Voice of America" fanned the flames, stirred up trouble, and hoped that China would be in chaos; the U.S. Embassy in China, assuming the role of the protector of the rioters, provided "shelter" for the planners and operators of the counter-revolutionary riots and the fugitives wanted by the Chinese public security department, Fang Lizhi and his wife; on June 5, the U.S. government also "condemned" China's suppression of the riots, expressing "great regret," and announced the suspension of government-to-government military sales and commercial weapons exports, and the interruption of mutual visits by military leaders of the two countries. These acts of interference in China's internal affairs by the U.S. government and its propaganda agencies further exposed their ambition to support "peaceful evolution" in China. This is unacceptable to the Chinese people.

It should be pointed out that since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States in 1972, the relationship between the two countries has developed to a certain extent. As long as the two sides handle the relationship between the two countries in accordance with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, there is a good and stable prospect for development. We advise the U.S. government and people in the government and society to put the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations first, not to interfere in China's internal affairs, and not to attempt to carry out "peaceful evolution" in China. Currently, the counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in the Chinese capital have been suppressed. The planners of the turmoil and riots have ended in failure. We advise people not to look at China with shortsightedness. China's adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles will not change, and the adherence to reform and opening up will not change. China will continue to implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy and, on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, develop relations with all countries. China will not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and will not allow any country to interfere in China's internal affairs. Whether it is attempting to carry out "peaceful evolution" in China or, after the failure of this plot, carrying out "sanctions," in the end, the losers will only be themselves. This is what the dialectics of history tells us.

    《美国之音》的表演与“和平演变”策略
    吴戈
    《美国之音》为什么对这次发生在北京的动乱和反党反社会主义的暴乱，会狂热地加以支持呢？只要我们稍稍回顾一下历史就会知道，这是美国粗暴干涉中国内政的又一恶劣表演，是美国垄断资产阶级中反共人士对中国推行“和平演变”策略的旧梦重温。
    马克思主义早就告诉人们，科学社会主义的思想体系和社会制度，作为资本主义的思想体系和社会制度的对立物，一经问世，就预示着整个资本主义必然衰落，预示着它最终要被社会主义制度所取代。这是由现代社会的内在矛盾和规律所决定的、不以人们意志为转移的自然历史过程。因此，任何一国社会主义制度的确立、巩固、完善和发展，都使资本主义雇佣劳动制度受到冲击和威胁。虽然，各国人民依照社会历史发展的客观规律来选择自己的生活方式和社会制度，完全是自己国家主权范围内的正义事业。但是，国际资产阶级中的反共人士，总是企图交替地运用武力颠覆与“和平演变”的两手策略，来扼杀和消灭新生的社会主义制度。我们且不说“十月革命”胜利之后，西方十四国的反动武装干涉曾企图把刚刚出世的苏维埃俄国扼杀在“红色的摇篮”里；且不说三十九年前，美国进行侵朝战争、派第七舰队进占台湾海峡，并运用贸易禁运，经济封锁，以及其后成百次地、挑衅地侵犯我领海领空等手段，企图用武力颠覆社会主义中国。在这里，我们要回顾的是，当中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，依靠勤劳的双手，依靠艰苦奋斗，使社会主义制度在中华大地上站稳了脚跟，社会主义事业获得了稳固的基础，中国的国际威望大大提高的情况下，甚至在双方努力下于1972年中美两国建交之后，美国的一些反共人士仍然念念不忘对中国推行“和平演变”策略，幻想在将来的某一天实现其颠覆社会主义制度的目标。
    奉行“和平演变”的策略，是美国朝野的反共人士在武力干涉失败后，或在社会历史条件变得使武力干涉成为一种不现实的选择时所作的一种策略转换。从四十年前的艾奇逊到五十年代的杜勒斯，再到今日美国反共势力的若干作为，就体现了这种策略转换的历史轨迹。
    美国前国务卿艾奇逊，是制订对华“和平演变”策略的始作俑者。1949年年中，中国人民反对美国出钱出枪，蒋介石出人，替美国打仗杀中国人的那场人民解放战争的胜利，已成定局，不可逆转。在军事干涉失败后，在这年8月发表《美国与中国关系》即“白皮书”的前夕，艾奇逊在7月20日致杜鲁门总统的一封信中，制订和提出了鼓励支持中国的“民主个人主义者”，妄图使中国“和平演变”为资本主义的斗争策略。他在信中说：“我们仍旧相信，在不久的将来，中国的局面无论可能是怎样悲惨，无论中国庞大人口中的一主要部分，可能残酷地处于为一外国帝国主义利益而效力的一个政党的剥削之下，中国悠久文明和民主个人主义终将再起来，中国终将推翻外来的羁绊。我认为我们应当鼓励在中国的一切发展，这些发展在现在或将来都是为了达到这个目标而工作。”显然，艾氏在这里说的“帝国主义”，指的是苏联；而“一个政党”，指的是中国共产党。艾氏这些充满诬蔑言词的主旨，是提出了一种“鼓励”中国的“民主个人主义者”，从内部搞“和平演变”，以推翻中国共产党的领导，搞垮人民政权为目标的策略。由于在当时及其后的一段时间里，美国对华奉行的主要是公开敌视的态度和军事侵略及军事威胁政策，因而搞“和平演变”还不是他们占主导地位的策略思想。
    真正把“和平演变”开始视为对社会主义国家进行斗争的主要策略，是杜勒斯时代的产物。从四十年代末到五十年代中，社会主义制度继苏联之后，先后在中国和其他一些人民民主主义国家中牢固地建立起来，并且开始显示出旺盛的生命力。而在这期间，美国的侵朝战争也以失败而告终。显然，再试图主要用武力来颠覆社会主义国家，是行不通的、也是极不得人心的愚蠢行为。于是，他们不得不实行策略转变，即把“和平演变”作为对付社会主义国家的主要的策略原则。五十年代中，当时美国国务卿杜勒斯，在我国实行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”方针后的一次国策声明中，就公开宣称，美国的政策是要促进苏联、东欧和中国等社会主义国家的自由化（即自由主义化或资本主义化），并寄希望于这些国家的第三代人和第四代人。所谓“促进”这些社会主义国家的“自由化”，就是要策动和配合这些国家内部的残余的资本主义势力，搞“和平演变”，使社会主义社会逐渐演变成资本主义社会。因此一举，“杜勒斯”这个名字，也就成为搞“和平演变”的代名词。不过，在六十和七十年代，由于美国和一些西方国家主要推行的是“战争边缘政策”和“冷战”政策，由此造成的逐渐升级的军备竞赛，以及东西方紧张的国际形势，使得他们“和平演变”的策略原则，无法充分施展。
    进入八十年代后，在美国朝野的一些反共人士看来，是他们搞“和平演变”的极好时机。因为自二次大战迄今，西方资本主义国家在这段和平环境中，现代科学技术有了迅猛的发展，社会经济力量有了迅速的膨胀，社会和阶级矛盾得到了局部的调整和缓和，因而资本主义世界在经济和科技上积累起了相对的优势。与此同时，一些社会主义国家，由于种种复杂原因，在社会和经济问题上，遭受到了程度不同的挫折。社会主义事业在取得到了巨大成就的同时，也在前进中发生了一些新的问题和困难。其中一个普遍性的原因，是僵化、过时的经济体制和政治体制，呈现出种种弊端，从而妨碍了社会主义优越性的充分发挥，阻滞了社会生产力的发展、人民生活水平的较快提高和社会主义民主的充分发展。所以，从七十年代末开始，中国和其他一些社会主义国家，都先后开始进行全面的社会主义的体制改革。在马克思主义者看来，这些改革是社会主义制度本身的自我完善和发展。而在西方某些反共、反社会主义者的眼中，社会主义国家的改革，正是他们策动这些国家“和平演变”的千载难逢的机遇。而这期间，东西方开始走向缓和的趋势，也为他们在不断扩大的东西方交往中贯彻这种策略原则，提供了方便条件。
    对美国一些反共人士对社会主义国家搞“和平演变”，我们要警惕他们的两手：
    其中一手，是他们使用经济援助和技术转让作为手段，想引诱社会主义国家上当，或者借以施加压力，促使它们在经济上和政治上搞“和平演变”。凡是不愿意搞“和平演变”的国家，他们就不提供“实质性的援助”，或者先给点援助，然后就用“逼债”等经济手段，来迫使你就范。关于这一点，作为中华民族败类的方励之，是深谙外国主子心意的。他曾向华尔街的老板们献计说，在中国走什么道路的问题上，外国要向中国政府施加压力，抽回在中国的投资。而作为这一点的前提，是在短期内既要给予刺激，又不要激化到使中国完全实行自力更生的程度，并在短期内通过外国在中国的投资，在达到“中国对外国投资有更大的依赖性”时，即“在国际社会和中国的关系上经济因素越来越重要的时候，那就容易……”了。至于“容易什么”，方先生欲言又止。其实是不言而喻的，他就是想借助西方的经济压力，来达到他们梦寐以求的，在中国搞“和平演变”亦即实现“全盘西化”的目标。当然，在中国与外国的经济关系上，我们决不能因噎废食，在平等互利和不附加任何政治条件的前提下，我们仍应扩大对外经济交往，仍应尽可能多一些地引进外资和加强技术合作。但同时，对蓄意玩弄“和平演变”阴谋的人们，我们则应保持必要的警觉。
    至于我们要警惕人家的另一手，那就是他们运用资产阶级意识形态，即以美国式的自由、民主和人权观念作为精神武器，向社会主义国家浸润、渗透，并用以策动和支持我们国内坚持资产阶级自由化立场的极少数人，从内部瓦解社会主义制度。
    马克思主义者历来认为，以抽象的自由、民主和人权作为旗帜的资产阶级思想文化，在反对封建专制主义的斗争中，曾发挥过积极作用。但它在本质上，是资产阶级雇佣劳动制度、资产阶级利益在观念上的反映。它作为在该社会中占统治地位的意识形态，取得了社会的名义，并被赋予了抽象的普遍性的形式，因而它是一元的，是为资本主义经济基础服务的。在社会主义制度下，无产阶级的自由、民主和权利观念，已经改造和扬弃了资产阶级思想意识中的消极成分，两者之间存在着根本性的差别。在这里，社会主义民主意识和制度，代表的是工人阶级和劳动人民的根本利益和意志，是与社会主义经济结构相适应的政治和观念的上层建筑。因此，在社会主义制度下，应该发展社会主义的民主、自由和权利观念；如果在社会主义社会中，要求实现资产阶级性质的民主、自由和人权，必然会瓦解社会主义制度本身。然而，资产阶级的一些思想家和追随者，为了让资产阶级思想意识在社会主义社会中争得某种合法地位，并用以作为搞“和平演变”的思想工具，却硬要说它是“多元化的”。故而，西方反共人士所希望的社会主义社会中的“政治多元化的改革”，只不过是他们搞“和平演变”的隐蔽的说法。对此，连“高自联”的头目王丹，也是心领神会的。王丹曾对北大的一位同学说：他们闹事的“最低目标”，是争取承认“高自联”合法，为方励之平反，民间办报；而他们的“最高目标”，则是要“建立多元政体，实现精英政治”。
    因此应该说，国内外一些人想在中国搞“和平演变”与中国人民反对“和平演变”的斗争，不仅是国际范围内阶级斗争的一种特殊形式，也是中国社会本身一定范围内存在的阶级斗争的一种表现。因为在国内，搞“和平演变”，也有一层薄薄的社会基础。在中国社会内，包括知识界，甚至在共产党内，仍然存在着极少数羡慕资本主义制度的人。如果说，当年的“民主个人主义者”只是一些对美国存有幻想，对共产党尚有误解的中间分子的话，那么，今日中国的一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，则是拜倒在西方文明脚下，狂热地反对社会主义制度的反动分子。如方励之、王丹、刘晓波之流，他们不仅是反共、反社会主义的狂热分子，而且也是中华民族的败类。他们奴性十足，崇洋媚外，与国外反共势力心心相印，内外勾结，配合默契，在中国制造动乱和暴乱，企图推翻共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度，颠覆人民共和国，建立依附于西方的资产阶级共和国。方励之之流，是美国反共人士妄图在中国搞“和平演变”的应声虫。
    也正因如此，《美国之音》对于这次发生在北京的动乱和暴乱的煽动和支持，才达到了利令智昏、忘乎所以的程度。人们记得，今年春季美国总统访华时，美国驻华使馆所导演的方励之的“赴宴风波”，显然是对方励之正在酝酿在中国闹事的一种露骨的支持。在这次发生动乱和暴乱过程中，《美国之音》大肆煽风点火，拨弄是非，唯恐中国不乱；美国驻华使馆又以暴乱分子的保护神自居，为反革命暴乱的策划者和操纵者、我公安部门通缉的人犯方励之夫妇提供“庇护”；6月5日，美国政府又对中国平息暴乱进行“指责”，表示“极大的遗憾”，并且，宣布中止中美政府间的军售和商业性的武器出口，中断中美两国军事领导人的互访活动。美国政府及其宣传机构的这些干涉中国内政的行径，进一步暴露了他们支持在中国搞“和平演变”的野心。这是中国人民所不能容允的。
    应该指出，自1972年中美建交以来，两国关系有了一定的发展。中美双方只要按照和平共处五项原则来处理两国关系，就具有良好和稳定的发展前景。我们奉劝美国政府和朝野人士，应以中美关系的大局为重，不要干涉中国的内政，也不要妄想在中国搞“和平演变”。目前，发生在中国首都的反革命暴乱已经平息。动乱暴乱的策划者们，以失败而告终。我们奉劝人们不应用近视的眼光来看待中国。中国坚持四项基本原则是不会改变的，坚持改革开放也是不会改变的。中国将继续执行独立自主的和平外交政策，并在和平共处五项原则的基础上，发展同一切国家的关系。中国决不干涉别国的内政，也决不允许任何外国干涉中国的内政。企图在中国搞“和平演变”也罢，这一图谋失败之后搞什么“制裁”也罢，到头来吃亏的只能是他们自己。历史的辩证法，就是这样告诉我们的。
