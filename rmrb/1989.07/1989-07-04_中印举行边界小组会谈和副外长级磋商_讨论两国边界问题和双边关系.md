Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shucai and Indian Foreign Secretary Singh discussed the border issue between the two countries and ways to further improve and develop bilateral relations in a friendly and candid atmosphere. They also exchanged views on international and regional issues of mutual interest. Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shucai elaborated on China's position and proposals for resolving the China-India border issue. Both sides expressed the need to seek a solution to the border issue while striving to develop bilateral relations in other areas and to make efforts to maintain peace and tranquility in the actual control line region.

Foreign Minister Qian Qichen met with the Indian delegation. Singh said that since Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's visit to China, friendly exchanges between India and China have been satisfactory, and he hoped to maintain the momentum of the development of relations between the two countries. Foreign Minister Qian said that China and India are the two most populous countries in the world, and the continuous improvement and development of relations between the two countries are of great importance for stabilizing the regional situation and maintaining peace and stability in Asia and the world. The prospects for friendly cooperation between the two countries are broad.

During their stay in Beijing, the Indian guests visited the Great Wall, the Summer Palace, and other famous historical sites, toured factories and rural areas, and watched Beijing opera. Both sides agreed that the next round of talks and consultations will be held in India next year.
