**Editor's Note:** Jiuquan Oilfield, an old pioneer in the petroleum industry, has written many songs of self-reliance and hard work to share the nation's burdens and support national construction. Now, with the steps of reform and opening up, the oilfield is actively promoting the contract responsibility system. Faced with new situations arising from the reform, they have inherited and carried forward their fine traditions, combining the construction of material civilization with spiritual civilization, reforging the Jiuquan Spirit. The oilfield's production has achieved remarkable results, and the enterprise's cohesion has been correspondingly enhanced. Their experience is well worth noting.

"Wherever there is oil, there are Jiuquan people." The late famous poet Li Ji once passionately praised the broad-minded Jiuquan people.

Around 290 AD, the Jin Dynasty scholar Zhang Hua wrote in his "Bowu Zhi" about the oil in Jiuquan, vividly describing the contributions of Jiuquan Oilfield to the Chinese nation, which often leave people astonished. Especially in the 1960s, when the Republic faced temporary difficulties, to ensure that the "greater Jiuquan"—Daqing Oilfield—could produce oil as soon as possible, Jiuquan people went en masse to Daqing, Jiuquan's equipment was sent to Daqing, and Jiuquan's technical and political cadres went in batches to Daqing... They wrote the "Jiuquan Style" that once moved a generation to tears.

While generously supporting Daqing, Jiuquan people did not forget to develop themselves: with fewer people, one person did the work of two; with fewer machines, they used machinery to replace manual labor... Faced with difficulties, Jiuquan people did not complain, did not ask for more, and did not stop. They practiced and summarized the spirit of "every drop of oil," "every cent," "every degree of electricity," and "finding rice to eat," which shone with the light of hard work and inspired and nurtured a generation of "old oil workers."

After 50 years of development, Jiuquan Oilfield welcomed the unusual spring of 1988. The contract responsibility system was widely implemented in the oilfield, and workers' thoughts were strongly affected. Relying solely on economic and administrative measures was not enough. Only by emphasizing material interests while developing the fine traditions formed by Jiuquan people in the 1960s and reforging the Jiuquan Spirit could the enterprise's cohesion be enhanced.

For many years, the powerful slogan "workers are the masters of the enterprise" had strongly inspired workers' enthusiasm for labor. With the opening of the "doors and windows" of reform and opening up, workers' democratic awareness had increased, and mere slogans were no longer effective. What to do? The mine's approach was: treat workers equally, respect workers, understand workers, and encourage workers to participate in mine politics. Last year, the piecework contract plan for well repair took more than two months from conception to implementation. The mine leadership held multiple discussions, and the mine committee, expanded party committee meeting, management committee, and workers' congress repeatedly discussed it, making it seemingly transparent. But workers still did not understand or accept it, saying it was "semi-transparent." The mine leadership respected the workers' opinions and made it fully transparent: they let the leaders and workers of the well repair team jointly discuss the contract plan, participate in politics, and reveal all the cards. The knots were untied. Many young people volunteered to be team leaders, car group leaders, and post leaders, and the contract management was very lively. Someone humorously commented on the change: "As long as the old framework of 'leaders speak, workers listen' is genuinely changed, and the masters truly hold the keys and run the house, who wouldn't work hard!"

In the process of reforging the Jiuquan Spirit, leaders and workers adapted to each other, communicated in both directions, and enhanced their combined strength. The practice of the underground department can provide some inspiration. To open up the external market, Jiuquan Oilfield's underground department signed a deep well fracturing construction contract with Qinghai Oilfield. The department head led the workers to endure the scorching sun and sweltering heat, setting up camp in the vast desert of Qaidam. On the construction site, material life was hard, but spiritual life was rich: during leisure time, young people danced freely to disco music; those with various talents took the stage, performing, wrestling, playing chess, playing poker, telling stories, "carrots and cabbages, each to their own liking." The department head was also dragged onto the stage to sing a few lines of Qinqiang opera, making a group of people laugh uncontrollably. What to do when homesick? Don't worry, the party secretary of the department, who was in charge of the "rear," came to the "frontline" to visit and brought a pile of letters from the families in the "rear." Workers opened the letters and learned about how the department leaders helped the families design the "renovation project" in the courtyard, where the door was installed, and where the chicken coop was built... As they read, tears of warmth flowed down: "The leaders have even arranged the small matter of our chicken coop, what else is there to worry about?" Those who went out were reassured, but the families in the "rear" might not all be reassured. The department leaders also recorded the lively scenes on the construction site and brought them back to make the families happy. In this way, both ends were reassured, and the spirit of producing more oil for the country was combined.

The experience of the underground department, once promoted, became a valuable asset in reforging the Jiuquan Spirit. Throughout the oilfield, lantern exhibitions, flower exhibitions, fish and bird exhibitions, embroidery and knitting exhibitions were held; dance parties, art festivals, speech contests, fashion shows, and sports activities were held throughout the year; at the Jiuquan Petroleum Poetry Society, the passionate singing of more than 30 poets, including Shao Yanshang, flew, and "Jiuquan Petroleum Poetry Selection" was published; Jiuquan people's own musical works "Spring in Yumen City," songs "Ode to Jiuquan," dances "Snowflakes Lightly Dance, Oil Extraction Busy," and art and calligraphy works won multiple awards in Gansu Province, and 7 photographic works were sent to the National Art Museum for exhibition; the oilfield's television documentary "Enchanted by Yumen" was beloved by visiting relatives, and was taken to Hong Kong and Taiwan for broadcasting... Who can calculate the influence of these activities, which focus on caring for, communicating with, and enriching people's colorful lives, on the enterprise's microclimate? How strong is the attraction for reforging the Jiuquan Spirit?

Under the Qilian Mountains, in Jiuquan Oilfield, many people respectfully speak of an "old oil worker." His name is Ma Wulin. After retiring, he couldn't stay at home and voluntarily took up two iron buckets, traveling between the mountain valleys, oil wells, and canals, shoveling and scooping up spilled oil, unceasingly for 5 years, recovering over 7,000 tons of crude oil, worth nearly a million yuan.

It was a chilly spring night when the female oil worker Yao Hongrong from the Comprehensive Team 2 of Laojunmiao Oil Mine finished her night shift at midnight and suddenly remembered that due to insufficient steam supply from the boiler, three or four oil wells had not been steamed. If the pipeline froze, it would cause an accident. Little Yao woke up her father, who was already asleep, and asked what to do. The "old oil worker" did not say a word, accompanied his daughter, and stumbled in the dark to the oil well several miles away, working with the on-duty workers to steam the oil wells until the next morning at around 5:30...

It is these real Jiuquan people, with their burning passion and love for the motherland, who are reforging the Jiuquan Spirit and tempering the Jiuquan soul.

Heaven will not drop pies, and good times will not come by sitting and waiting. The oilfield's takeoff relies on sweat, and the country's revitalization relies on hard work! They know that this is not yet the time for enjoyment. Excessive desires for enjoyment and consumption will definitely hollow out the ancient building of the Republic! It is precisely because Jiuquan does not forget this that it has struggled hard in the tide of reform and achieved remarkable results: last year, they broke the long-standing stalemate in oilfield geological exploration; the oilfield's total decline rate was only 1.3%, setting a national record; the total industrial output value, fund profit and tax rate, per capita profit and tax rate, and output value profit and tax rate all ranked at the forefront of the industry nationwide.

    “重塑”玉门精神
    伏泽清　白文清　赵钢
    编者按　玉门油田，石油战线上的老先进，当年为国分忧，为了多产石油，支援国家建设，全体职工谱写过一首首独立自主、艰苦奋斗的颂歌。现在，随着改革、开放的脚步，油田积极推行承包经营责任制。面对改革中出现的新情况，他们继承和发扬优良传统，把物质文明建设同精神文明建设结合起来，重塑玉门精神，油田生产取得注目成果，企业凝聚力相应增强。他们的经验很值得重视。
    “凡有石油处，必有玉门人。”已故著名诗人李季，曾这样深情赞美过胸怀宽广的玉门人。
    公元290年前后，晋人张华编撰《博物志》，对玉门石油作了精彩描绘以来，玉门油田对中华民族的贡献，常叫人感叹不已。特别是60年代，在共和国遇到暂时困难的日子里，为了更大的“玉门”——大庆油田尽早出油，玉门人成建制地开往大庆，玉门的成套设备运向大庆，玉门的技术、思想政治工作骨干成批转战大庆……谱写了曾使一代人流下热泪的“玉门风格”。
    玉门人慷慨支援大庆的同时，也不忘发展自己：人员减少了，一人干两人的活；设备减少了，用机械替代……困难面前，玉门人不叹气、不索取、不停步，实践并总结出闪耀着艰苦奋斗之光的“一滴油”、“一厘钱”、“一度电”、“找米下锅”等精神，激励、培育了一代“老石油”。
    开发了50年的玉门油田，迎来了1988年不寻常的春天。承包经营责任制在油田大面积推开，职工思想反应强烈，单靠经济手段和行政手段不行，只有在重视物质利益的同时，发展玉门人60年代形成的优良传统，重塑玉门精神，才能增强企业凝聚力。
    多少年来，“职工是企业的主人”这个简洁有力的口号，曾那么强烈地激发了职工的劳动热情。随着改革、开放的“门窗”启开，职工的民主意识增强了，光喊口号不灵了。怎么办？油矿的办法是：平等对待，尊重职工，理解职工，鼓励职工参与矿政。去年，修井计件承包方案从酝酿到产生，花了2个多月。油矿领导多次论证，矿务会、党委扩大会、管委会和职代会，也反复讨论了，算是透明了吧？可职工还是不理解、不接受，说是“半透明”的。油矿领导尊重职工意见，来了个全透明：让修井小队领导和修井工一起共商承包方案，参与议政，底牌亮明了，扣儿也就解开了。不少年轻人自荐当班长、车组长、岗位长，承包经营搞得很红火。有人风趣地说起这变化：“只要实心改变领导出嘴巴、工人出耳朵的旧框框，让主人真正既拿钥匙又当家，谁还不使劲儿干呢！”
    在重塑玉门精神的过程中，领导和职工相互适应，双向沟通，增强合力。井下处的实践，能给人们一些启发。为了开拓外部市场，玉门油田井下处与青海油田签订了深井压裂施工合同。处长带领职工顶烈日、熬酷暑，开到柴达木大戈壁“安营扎寨”。工地上，物质生活是差的，但精神生活却很丰富：业余时间，青年人跳起奔放的迪斯科；有各种特长的纷纷登场，献艺的、摔跤的、下棋的、打扑克的、讲故事的，“萝卜白菜，各有所爱”。处长也被拉扯上献几句秦腔，逗得一帮人前仰后倒。想家了如何是好？别急，“后方”主政的处党委书记来“前线”慰问了，捎来“后方”家属们的一大撂信。职工展开信，知晓了家属院安装暖气管线时，处领导怎样帮家属们设计院内“改造工程”，门安到了哪里，鸡窝垒在何处……读着读着，热泪淌下来了：“领导连咱家的鸡窝小事都安排停当了，还有啥不放心的？”外出的人放了心，“后方”家属们不一定全放心。处领导又把工地上热闹的实况录了相，带回去让家属们高兴高兴。这样，把两头放心，合成了为国多产油的事业心。
    井下处的经验一推开，成了重塑玉门精神的宝贵财富。在整个油田，灯展、花展、鱼鸟展、刺绣针织展，办起来了；舞会、艺术节、演讲会、时装表演、体育活动，四季不断；玉门石油诗会上，飞动着邵燕祥等30多位诗人的炽情吟唱，出版了《玉门石油诗选》；玉门人自己创作的音乐作品《玉城春》、歌曲《玉门颂》、舞蹈《雪花轻扬采油忙》和美术、书法作品，多次在甘肃省获奖，7幅摄影作品送往中国美术馆展出；油田编拍的电视风光片《情醉酒泉》，受到探亲台胞的喜爱，被带回香港、台湾播放……谁能计算得出，这些着眼于关心、沟通、丰富人的多彩活动，对企业小气候有多大的影响力？对重塑玉门精神，有多强的吸引力？
    祁连山下，玉门油田，不少人以崇敬的话语，颂说着一个“老石油”。他叫马武林，退休后在家呆不住，主动挑起两只铁桶，往返于山沟、井场、渠边，一铲一勺地回收落地原油，5年不间断，竟然回收原油7000多吨，价值近百万元。
    那是春寒料峭的一天夜晚，老君庙油矿综合二队女采油工姚宏蓉，深夜12点下班回家后，忽然想起上班时因锅炉供气不足，三、四口油井没通上蒸气。如果管线冻结，就会造成事故。小姚硬是叫醒已熟睡了的爸爸，问怎么办？“老石油”二话没说，陪上女儿，高一脚、低一脚地摸黑赶到数里外的井场，与当班工人一块给油井通气，直干到次日凌晨5点多……
    就是这些实实在在的玉门人，用炽热的情，对祖国的爱，重塑着玉门精神，锻造着玉门魂。
    天上不会掉下馅饼来，好日子不会坐着等来，油田起飞要靠流汗，国家振兴要靠实干！他们知道眼下还不是享乐的时代，过度的享乐欲望、消费欲望，定会蛀空共和国古老的大厦！玉门正是不忘记这些，才在改革大潮中艰苦拚搏，取得了引人注目的成果：去年，他们打破了油田地质勘探多年徘徊的局面；油田总递减率仅为1.3％，创全国先进记录；工业总产值、资金利税率、人均利税率、产值利税率，均居全国同行业前列。
