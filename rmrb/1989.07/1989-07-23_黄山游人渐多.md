In mid-July, reporters from Xinhua News Agency saw at the famous Huangshan scenic area in Anhui Province that tourist buses were continuously passing over the Lanxing Bridge; cable cars were shuttling back and forth in the air. At scenic spots such as Wenchuan, Beihai, Xihai, and Yupinglou, enthusiastic tourists could be seen everywhere.

On the morning of the 15th, in front of the Sanhua Xieshe in Beihai, a young guide was introducing the "Dream Pen Blooms" scenic spot to a group of tourists from Hong Kong in Cantonese. We asked the guide, "How many tourists does Beihai have each day?" He replied, "From late March to early May, there are about four to five thousand people per day. From late May to mid-June, there are about two to three hundred people per day. Starting in July, the number of tourists increases daily, and now there are about five thousand people per day." Tour groups from Japan, France, the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Taiwan have all arrived.

    黄山游人渐多
    新华社记者　沈祖润　纪成助
    7月中旬，记者在闻名中外的安徽省黄山旅游区看到：旅游车在揽胜桥上川流不息；缆车在空中往返不停。温泉、北海、西海、玉屏楼等风景区，到处可见兴致极高的游人。
  15日上午。北海散花精舍前，一位年轻的导游正在用广东话向来自香港的一个旅游团介绍“梦笔生花”景点。我们问这位导游：“北海每天有多少游客？”他说：“3月下旬到5月上旬，每天有四五千人，5月下旬到6月中旬，每天二三百人，进入7月，游客一天比一天多，现在每天有5000人左右”。日本、法国、菲律宾、香港、台湾都有团来。
