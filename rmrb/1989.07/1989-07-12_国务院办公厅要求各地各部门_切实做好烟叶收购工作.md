The tobacco leaves across the country are growing well this year, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Currently, 80,000 workers have been mobilized and organized nationwide to undertake the upcoming tobacco leaf procurement work. To improve the procurement quality and prevent the occurrence of tobacco leaf wars, the State Council Office recently issued a notice requiring all local governments and departments to strictly implement national policies and quality standards.

The notice points out that no unit or individual is allowed to tamper with prices; the national standards for tobacco leaves must be strictly enforced, and mixed-grade tobacco leaves and those with adulteration and counterfeiting are not allowed to be procured; the contract system for tobacco leaf production must be seriously promoted, and tobacco farmers must sell their tobacco at designated procurement points, otherwise, the supply of agricultural materials and support funds as stipulated in the contract will be canceled.

A responsible person from the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration told the reporter that this year's national tobacco leaf planting area is roughly the same as last year, but due to the increase in yield per unit area, it is expected to complete the national procurement plan. In recent years, there have been some serious problems in tobacco leaf procurement, mainly including relaxing grades and mixing grades, lowering standards; some places have set up procurement points indiscriminately, increased prices, and engaged in competitive procurement, and in some places, tobacco merchants have been rampant, colluding with outsiders to buy and sell. These have caused huge economic losses to the state and the cigarette production industry. For example, Henan Province alone has incurred a loss of 220 million yuan.

This responsible person hopes that all local governments and departments will strictly implement the notice of the State Council Office on the opinions of the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration and the China National Tobacco Corporation on doing a good job in tobacco leaf procurement work. They should strictly implement national price policies and national quality standards without any discount. At the same time, it is also required that the tobacco leaf procurement personnel patiently and meticulously do a good job for the tobacco farmers, and no behavior that harms the interests of the tobacco farmers is allowed. Efforts should be made to encourage and guide tobacco farmers to increase their income by improving the quality of tobacco leaves.

    国务院办公厅要求各地各部门
    切实做好烟叶收购工作
    本报讯　记者莫新元报道：今年全国烟叶长势良好，丰收在望。目前全国已动员组织起8万职工，担负起即将开始的烟叶收购工作。为提高收购质量，防止烟叶大战出现，国务院办公厅最近发出通知，要求各地各部门严格贯彻执行国家有关政策和质量标准。
    通知指出，不允许任何单位和个人在价格问题上做手脚；要严格执行烟叶的国家标准，对混级烟及掺杂使假的烟叶，不准收购；要认真推行烟叶生产合同制，烟农要在指定的收购站点卖烟，否则取消合同规定的农用物资的供应和扶持资金。
    国家烟草专卖局负责人向记者介绍，今年全国烟叶种植面积大体和去年持平，但由于单位产量提高，预计能完成国家下达的收购计划。近年来，烟叶收购中出现了比较严重的问题，主要是松级混等，降低标准；一些地方乱设收购网点，加价抢购，有的地方烟贩活动猖獗，内外勾结，倒买倒卖。这些都给国家和卷烟生产行业造成巨大经济损失，仅河南省就损失2.2亿元。
    这位负责人希望各地各部门严格贯彻执行国务院办公厅转发国家烟草专卖局、中国烟草总公司关于认真搞好烟叶收购工作意见的通知，不折不扣地执行国家价格政策和国家质量标准，同时也要求烟叶收购人员耐心细致地做好烟农的工作，不允许有任何损害烟农利益的行为发生，要鼓励和引导烟农靠提高烟叶质量来增加收益。
