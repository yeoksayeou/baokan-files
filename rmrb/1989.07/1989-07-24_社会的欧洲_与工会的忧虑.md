The twelve member states of the European Community are currently discussing the construction of a "Social Europe," which has attracted the attention of people from all walks of life, especially the broad masses of workers.

The so-called "Social Europe," as described by the President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, is to "promote employment and strengthen solidarity," ensuring that the existing rights of ordinary citizens are not compromised in the future unified market.

In recent years, the European Community has made varying degrees of progress in building a large market, particularly in the areas of capital circulation and economic and monetary union. However, it has not made significant strides in constructing a "Social Europe." Two years ago, Belgium proposed drafting a "basic guideline" for the rights of workers. Subsequently, Delors encouraged labor-management negotiations, aiming to establish the agreements reached through these negotiations as "European Community legislation." At the beginning of this year, the European Economic and Social Committee passed the basic content of the "Social Charter" with a majority vote. The charter, on one hand, calls for guaranteeing the basic rights of workers in member states, such as social insurance, equal opportunity, union freedom, and training, and on the other hand, advocates for new regulations in areas such as dismissal procedures.

However, there are differing opinions between the European Trade Union Confederation and the European Commission on the form in which the "Social Charter" should appear. The former hopes it will become a "binding" law, while the latter advocates for it to appear only as a "solemn declaration" of the European Council. Delors believes that a "solemn declaration" already has "considerable moral value." At the end of May this year, the European Commission adopted the "European Community Basic Social Rights Charter," proposing suggestions on citizens' freedom of movement, improving working and social conditions, employment, remuneration, and vocational training. Due to the firm opposition of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the European summit at the end of June was unable to fully discuss this issue.

The unions of the European Community countries are concerned about what "Social Europe" will look like. Generally speaking, they support the goal of a unified market, viewing it as a "sign of hope." A survey report published by the European Commission last year also provided encouraging news: if the European Community completes the construction of the large market while implementing corresponding economic measures, it could create five million jobs within five years, which would be a good thing for the current unemployment rate of 15.6 million in the European Community.

However, hope is not reality. The unions, in particular, are worried about the future interests of workers. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has explicitly stated that the European Community should not become a "region dominated by market forces," otherwise, it would only benefit the employers, while for the vast majority of workers, it would mean a reduction in social insurance and welfare. The French General Confederation of Labor demands "additional guarantees" for workers. The French General Confederation of Labor calls for the European Community to "break free from the supervision of multinational corporations." A German trade union official, Hans, put it more bluntly: "The European Community has been, and will continue to be, a community of bosses." In summary, trade union organizations do not want to see the danger of workers' living standards "aligning downward" after the completion of the unified market, thereby "increasing social inequality" and making "Social Europe" a "forgotten corner."

    “社会的欧洲”与工会的忧虑
    姚立
    欧洲共同体十二个成员国正围绕建设“社会的欧洲”展开讨论，它引起各方人士、特别是广大劳动者的关注。
    所谓“社会的欧洲”，用欧共体委员会主席德洛尔的话说，就是“促进就业和加强团结”，使普通公民的现有权益在未来统一大市场中不至受损害。
    几年来，欧共体在建设大市场的过程中，已经在资本流通、经济和货币联盟等方面取得了不同程度的进展。但在建设“社会的欧洲”方面，尚未迈出大的步子。前年五月，比利时曾提议就劳动者的权利制定一项“基本方针”。随后，德洛尔鼓励劳资双方谈判，然后将谈判达成的协议以“欧共体立法”的形式确立下来。今年初，欧洲社会和经济委员会以多数票通过了“社会宪章”的基本内容。宪章一方面要求保证各成员国劳动者的基本权利，如社会保险、机会均等、工会自由及培训等，同时呼吁在解雇制度等方面制订新规定。
    但是，“社会宪章”以何种形式出现，欧洲工会联合会和欧共体委员会的意见却不尽相同。前者希望它能成为带“强制性”的法律。后者却主张它仅仅以欧共体理事会的“庄严声明”的形式出现。德洛尔认为“庄严声明”已经具有“相当的道义价值”。今年五月底，欧共体委员会通过了《欧共体基本社会权利宪章》，就公民的自由流动、改善工作和社会条件、就业、报酬及职业培训等提出了建议。由于英国首相撒切尔夫人的坚决反对，六月底的欧共体首脑会议未能充分讨论这个问题。
    欧共体各国的工会对“社会的欧洲”将是个什么样子感到忧虑。一般来讲，它们赞成统一大市场的目标，将其视为“希望的信号”。欧共体委员会去年公布的一项调查报告也确提供了令人鼓舞的消息：如果欧共体在完成大市场建设的同时，附以相应的经济措施，欧共体可在五年内创造五百万个就业机会，这对目前高达一千五百六十万失业大军的欧共体来说当然是件好事。
    但是，希望毕竟不是现实。工会方面尤其对未来劳动者的利益表示担忧。爱尔兰工会联合会就明确表示，欧共体不能成为一个“市场力量主宰一切的地区”，否则，只能对资方有利，对广大劳动者却意味着社会保险和福利的减少。法国工人力量总工会要求给劳动者“附加保证”。法国总工会则要求欧共体“摆脱跨国公司的监护”。西德的一位工会负责人汉斯说得更明确：“欧共体过去是，今后仍将是老板的共同体。”总之，工会组织不愿出现这样的危险，即在统一大市场建成后，劳动者的生活水平“向下看齐”，从而“增加社会的不平等”，使“社会的欧洲”成为“被人遗忘的角落”。
