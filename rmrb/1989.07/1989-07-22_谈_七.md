The number "seven" has a close relationship with people's lives. Firewood, rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar, and tea encompass the necessities of life. Joy, anger, sorrow, worry, grief, fear, and surprise are known as the "seven emotions" in traditional Chinese medicine, which diagnoses diseases based on "emotional fluctuations." The "tangram," a puzzle consisting of seven flat shapes, can be arranged to form various figures and is still popular worldwide. People have established the "seven-note scale" from different musical notes. The human body has seven orifices: ears, eyes, mouth, and nostrils. The globe is divided into "seven continents"; a week has "seven days."

In ancient astronomy, there are twenty-eight constellations. They are divided into four directions: east, west, south, and north, with each direction having exactly "seven constellations." The colors of a rainbow form a continuous spectrum, but people distinguish seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. In optics, a "seven-color plate" made from these seven colors can be used to demonstrate the principle that white light is composed of seven colored lights.

In ancient China, there were essays named after "seven," known as the "seven forms." The "seven forms" originated in the Western Han Dynasty. During the Western Han Dynasty, En Sheng wrote an essay titled "Seven Stimulations," which inspired later writers to imitate this style, such as Huan Lin's "Seven Discussions," Fu Yi's "Seven Excitements," Zhang Heng's "Seven Refutations," Ma Rong's "Seven Expansions," Cao Zhi's "Seven Invitations," and Zuo Si's "Seven Admonitions," among others. In Chinese folklore, there are stories like "Seven Fairies," "The Seventh Night Festival," and "Seven Captures of Meng Huo." The number "seven" is almost inexplicable.

    谈“七”
    数字“七”，与人们的生活有着密切的关系。柴、米、油、盐、酱、醋、茶，囊括了生活中的必需品。喜、怒、哀、思、悲、恐、惊，在祖国医学里谓之“七情”，中医则根据“七情波动”诊断疾病。“七巧板”，是用正方形薄板或厚纸裁成形状不同的七块小板的玩具，用
  “七巧板”可以拼成各种图形，至今还在世界流传。人们从不同的音乐中制定了“七音音阶”。人的身体有七窍：耳、目、口、鼻七孔。全球大陆分“七大洲”；一个星期有“七日”。
    古代天文学中，有二十八星宿。它们按东、西、南、北分为四方，每一方恰好为“七宿”。彩虹的颜色是个连续的光谱，但是人们却从中辨析出红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫“七色”，光学上用这七种颜色制成“七色板”，可以用它来证明由七种色光合成白光的原理。
    在我国古代，有以“七”名篇者，谓之“七体”。“七体”肇兴于西汉。西汉枚乘著文，题作《七发》，从此，后代文人纷纷仿效其体，诸如桓麟《七说》，傅毅《七激》，张衡《七辨》，马融《七广》，曹植《七启》，左思《七讽》……我国古代传说故事中，有“七仙女”、“七夕相会”、“七擒孟获”等等。“七”简直是不可思议的数字。（7月4日《建设报》张宜清文）
