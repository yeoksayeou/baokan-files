The report of the 13th Party Congress pointed out: "The construction of socialist democratic politics, like the development of the socialist commodity economy, is a gradual, cumulative process." This article attempts to provide some insights into the deepening of China's socialist democratic politics through a review of the historical development of democratic politics, an exploration of the development of democratic politics itself, and an analysis of the current environment for the construction of democratic politics, and seeks the opinions of others.

In human history, the establishment and perfection of democratic politics in a certain state form is a long process.

Lenin pointed out: "Democracy is a form of state, a form of state power." (Lenin Selected Works, Volume 3, page 257) Thus, so-called democratic politics, as a political institution of democracy, is first and foremost a historical category, a political institution of a certain state form. It has gone through different stages of development in human social history, manifested in different contents and forms, and experienced a long process from low to high, from incomplete to increasingly perfect.

The ruling forms of the slave society and the feudal society were monarchical and republican, but their basic form was monarchical dictatorship. The republican forms that had appeared, such as the Roman Republic from the 6th century BC to the 1st century BC, the Spartan Republic and the Athenian Democratic Republic of ancient Greece, and the feudal republican city-states of Venice, Genoa, Florence, etc., in medieval Europe, did not escape the historical limitations of slavery and feudalism. Their essence was still the rule of slave owners and nobles, and democracy was only a privilege of the few.

Modern capitalist society has developed the democratic politics of the exploitative class to its peak. The early bourgeois enlightenment thinkers clearly put forward the slogans of "liberty, equality, fraternity" and "equality before the law," laying the ideological foundation for the establishment of the capitalist democratic political system. The development of the commodity economy made the establishment of the bourgeois democratic political system have decisive objective conditions. In the subsequent 400 years, the bourgeoisie began the arduous journey of building its democratic politics. From the French bourgeois revolution to the establishment and consolidation of the entire capitalist democratic politics, it experienced several major bourgeois revolutions and endured the trials of two world wars, gradually forming a democratic political system centered on the parliamentary system, including "separation of powers," "universal suffrage," and "multi-party system." The perfection of capitalist democratic politics, although a great historical progress, is in essence still "an incomplete, impoverished, and hypocritical democracy, a democracy enjoyed only by the rich, only by the few" (Lenin Selected Works, Volume 3, page 248).

Socialist democratic politics, in essence, are fundamentally different from the democratic politics of the exploitative class. Therefore, the road to building a new type of socialist democratic politics is not smooth and cannot reach the ideal state in a short period. The first socialist country, the Soviet Union, although it opened up the road to building a socialist democratic political system, in more than 70 years of practice, it has been difficult, with many mistakes. Some socialist countries have also experienced more than 40 years of development in building democratic politics, but the road to establishing a truly socialist democratic politics is still very far away. China, although it has established a socialist democratic political system with the people's congress system as its core, the forms and procedures for realizing democracy are still very incomplete, and the task of building socialist democratic politics is equally arduous.

Recently, a small number of people instigated unrest in the capital and other parts of the country, and a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Their goal was not to promote the construction of socialist democratic politics in China, but to use the banner of democracy to destroy democracy and the legal system, and to destroy the stable and united political situation. If their plot succeeds, reforms and opening up, democracy and the legal system, modernization construction, will all become illusions, and China will experience a great historical setback.

Reviewing the process of the emergence, development, and replacement of various forms of democratic politics in history gives us great enlightenment and lessons:

First, the democratic politics of a certain state form is a historical choice and is subject to the historical conditions and national conditions of the time. In the long river of history, whether it is the democratic tide or democratic politics, it has emerged with the emergence of commodity exchange and developed with the development of commodity exchange. The democratic politics of a certain state form does not depend on the subjective wishes of the people at that time, but mainly depends on the social and economic conditions of the time. The current stage of China's socialist democratic politics construction must be based on the realistic economic and social foundation, and cannot be based on abstract and subjective wishes such as "purest," "broadest," and "most genuine."

Second, the democratic politics of a certain state form have their specific class content, that is, they reflect the interests and demands of a certain class. Although capitalist democratic politics have reached the peak of the democratic politics of the exploitative class, they essentially maintain the fundamental interests of the bourgeoisie. To examine the democratic politics of a certain state form, if one only focuses on the scope of implementation, the degree of realization, the speed of development, the hierarchical distribution, and other quantitative aspects and forms of expression, it will lead to one-sidedness of discussing forms away from essence and content, falling into the pit of pursuing "abstract democracy" or "general democracy," and even going astray, which is very unfavorable to China's socialist democratic politics construction.

Third, the construction of democratic politics of a certain state form needs to go through a long process, which is a universal historical law. History shows us that the emergence and perfection of the democratic politics of a certain state form have gone through a long process of several hundred to several thousand years. Building socialist democratic politics, which are fundamentally different from the democratic politics of the exploitative class, will inevitably go through a long process of emergence, development, and perfection, and the task will be more arduous and cannot be achieved overnight.

From the perspective of its own development, the construction of democratic politics is an orderly and gradual process.

As a political democratic system, it is a specific social existence, has gone through different historical stages of its own development, and has its own laws and characteristics of development. We believe that these laws and characteristics are prominently manifested in orderliness and explorability, gradualness and thoroughness.

Orderliness and explorability. Orderliness refers to the construction of democratic politics of a certain state form, which is subject to legal, followable procedures and rules, and is carried out in an orderly and step-by-step manner. This is determined by the class essence of democracy. The constitutions and laws of capitalist countries, on the one hand, claim that "sovereignty lies with the people," and on the other hand, stipulate that "private property is sacred and inviolable," trying to firmly establish the development of democratic politics on the foundation of private ownership, and trying to restrict the democratic demands of the proletariat and the broad masses within the scope of bourgeois democracy. Socialist democratic politics, on the other hand, include both extensive people's democracy and dictatorship over the enemy. Its development should also be orderly, not anarchistic.

Explorability is both a general law of cognitive development and an important characteristic of the development of democratic politics. As a state institution of democracy, in terms of class essence, it has undergone several changes, and in terms of external form, it has been constantly supplemented, developed, and perfected, and its development is itself a history of exploration. The ruling class, in the process of constant exploration, perfects its ruling form, and objectively provides quantitative accumulation for the construction of democratic politics; while the broad laboring masses' unremitting pursuit and struggle for the democratic ideal also prepare the conditions for the final establishment of a new democratic system for the majority. The development of democracy itself, from the stage of people's participation to the stage of people's self-government, provides relatively stable social conditions through orderliness, and opens up the way forward through explorability.

Gradualness and thoroughness. As a political democratic system, from its emergence to perfection is a long process of accumulation. In the democratic political system of a certain historical period, it contains not only the critical inheritance of past achievements but also its own perfection and sublimation, which cannot be completed without a long process of gradual progress.

Thoroughness is the general manifestation of the intrinsic essence of proletarian democratic politics. The establishment of the socialist public ownership system is the foundation for the people to be the masters of the country and is the main basis for the proletariat to create a more advanced democracy than the bourgeoisie. The democratic politics of the proletariat is a qualitative negation of bourgeois democracy, the highest type of democracy in history, and a thorough political equality. However, the socialist state created by the victorious proletarian revolution has relatively backward productive forces, and the development and maturity of the socialist commodity economy need a relatively long historical process. In connection with this, in the development of socialist democratic politics itself, it is still necessary to make a thorough break with the remnants of feudalism and old traditional ideas and to analyze and criticize bourgeois democratic ideas. Only in this way can the necessary conditions for building a highly democratic political system be created. It can be seen that this thoroughness is contained in gradualness and is realized through gradualness, running through the entire process of building socialist democratic politics.

Through the above discussion of the basic laws and characteristics of the development of the democratic political system, we have initially formed three understandings of the construction of socialist democratic politics:

(1) As a new type of people's democracy, the construction of socialist democratic politics needs to go through a process of active exploration and progress. Socialist democratic politics, for the first time, turn the democratic ideal of the rule of the majority into reality. Its class essence is progressive and revolutionary, and it is superior to any democratic political system of the exploitative class. Accordingly, the forms and procedures for realizing political democracy should also be relatively perfect and sound. However, looking at the practice of democratic politics construction in socialist countries in the past, the facts are not so. Although after decades of historical development, the ideal of the people being the masters of the country has not been fully realized, and its superiority has not been truly felt by the people, the process has shown signs of stagnation. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, the constraints of objective conditions, but on the other hand, the lack of an exploratory spirit and the adherence to rigid models cannot be denied as an important factor. In China, this contradiction is prominently manifested in the emphasis on the importance of the state system while neglecting the role of the people's congress, the emphasis on substantive democracy while neglecting procedural democracy, etc., leading to undemocratic decision-making, a large variability in the electoral system, an imperfect supervision mechanism, unregulated consultations and dialogues, and poor operability of relevant laws, etc., which affect the scope and degree of implementation of democratic politics. To solve this problem, we should first, through self-reform, gradually improve the forms and procedures for realizing democracy, so that socialist democratic politics become more coordinated and its superiority is fully exerted.

(2) As self-improvement on its own basis, the construction of socialist democratic politics should be combined with the construction of the legal system. The establishment of the socialist system provides the prerequisite conditions for the construction of democratic politics. On this basis, the construction of democratic politics is no longer a "political revolution" of one class overthrowing another, nor is it the spontaneous activities and struggles of the people, but is carried out in an orderly, step-by-step, and orderly manner. To improve the scope and degree of realization of democratic politics, it is undoubtedly necessary to widely advocate and promote democracy, but it is also necessary to have a stable social environment, otherwise, people's democracy cannot be realized. At the same time, democracy and the legal system are inseparable. Democracy can only be realized when it is legalized and institutionalized. If we deviate from the important characteristic of orderliness in the construction of democratic politics, the consequence may be the destruction of socialist democracy. Therefore, China's democratic politics construction should be based on the immediate interests of the whole people, combine democracy with the legal system, and carry out the work in a planned, step-by-step, and orderly manner under the premise of adhering to the four cardinal principles.

(3) As the highest type in the history of development, the construction of socialist democratic politics must be gradually promoted. China is a country with a long history of feudalism, underdeveloped commodity economy, imperfect legal system, long-term backward education, and generally low national cultural level. The deep-rooted feudal traditions make the task of promoting democratic politics more arduous and the difficulty greater. This requires us to make persistent efforts, eliminate interference from all sides, unify thoughts, policies, steps, methods, and actions, and steadily push forward the construction of democratic politics.

From the perspective of current conditions, the construction of democratic politics needs a gradual, cumulative process.

When discussing China's democratic politics construction or development, it is very necessary to have a basic understanding of the current material and spiritual social conditions and the current situation of democratic politics.

We know that the economic base not only determines the essence of democratic politics but also restricts its degree of realization. After 40 years of construction, China's national economy has made great progress, especially the achievements of the past decade of reform are remarkable, which is a fact that is evident to all. However, from an overall perspective, the level of productive forces is low and unbalanced, and the entire commodity economy is still in its initial stage of development, which is the reality we face. This decisive factor affects the development of the main body of democracy and the improvement of democratic quality, restricting China's current stage of democratic politics construction. This is prominently manifested in: relatively independent commodity producers and operators have not yet truly formed, and the forces to curb bureaucratism are weak; the actual enjoyment and full exercise of the people's democratic and freedom rights still lack sufficient material guarantees; the people lack an independent political personality and subject consciousness based on economic interests; the concepts of equivalent exchange, free choice, free competition, and equal opportunity are lacking, and the transformation of traditional political culture to democracy is slow, etc. In summary, the underdeveloped commodity economy in China's primary stage of socialism directly affects the process of democratic politics construction.

The development of democratic politics is not only restricted by social and economic conditions but also constrained by the state of spiritual civilization, including ideology, cultural quality, social ethics, etc. China was once a "country of rites and righteousness," and the ten years of reform adapted to the development of the commodity economy, and the construction of spiritual civilization has also achieved certain results. However, from the current situation, due to the lack of forceful efforts in this regard, the construction of spiritual civilization has shown signs of "slippage." If this problem is not solved well, China's socialist democratic politics construction will lack democratic ideals, democratic spirit, democratic culture, democratic responsibility, and democratic guarantees, and it will be easy to encounter setbacks in the development process.

Based on China's current conditions, the current tasks for China's socialist democratic politics construction are as follows:

First, we should prioritize the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the socialist commodity economy. The commodity economy, as the economic foundation of modern democratic politics, is undoubtedly also the basic condition for the development of socialist democratic politics. Especially in a country like ours, which is in the primary stage of socialism and is economically and culturally backward, in order to lay a solid foundation for democratic politics, we must firmly take the development of productive forces and the prosperity of the socialist economy as the center. Those who one-sidedly pursue high democracy and the development of individual freedom are unrealistic illusions.

Second, we should highlight the strategic position of education and promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. The construction of democratic politics cannot be separated from the improvement of national quality and the modernization of national culture. The backwardness of education and the "slippage" of spiritual civilization are major mistakes of the past few years. In view of this, we should appropriately adjust the construction layout, highlight the strategic position of education, and continuously improve the scientific and cultural level and ideological and political quality of the whole nation. At the same time, we should strengthen and improve the entire national education, strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization, so as to promote the awakening and sublimation of people's inner spirit, so that people's concepts and behaviors enter the track of modernization, so that the broad masses can break away from the traditional political culture of feudalism, so that people can recognize the essence of bourgeois democracy, firmly establish the ideal of socialist democracy, establish the spirit of democracy, take on the responsibility of democracy, and form a legal concept and social moral concept conducive to democracy.

Third, while firmly carrying out the reform of the economic system, we should unswervingly promote the reform of the political system. At the current stage, to develop China's commodity economy, we must reform the old economic system that is not adapted to it, and there is no other choice; while the reform of the economic system calls for the reform of the political system to coordinate and match it, and we need to take substantial steps in the separation of party and government, the reform of the cadre personnel system, the reform of the enterprise leadership system, the transformation of government functions, and the reform of institutions. For China's socialist democratic politics construction, the reform of the economic system creates conditions, and the reform of the political system opens up the way, and the two are indispensable. Currently, China's reform has encountered well-known difficulties, but we cannot lose confidence because of this. If the reform is stagnated and the old system is restored, it will be a greater "pain." Not only will democratic politics become a tree without roots and cannot be talked about, but it may also ruin the socialist cause.

Fourth, starting from improving the forms and procedures for realizing democracy, we should promote the process of China's socialist democratic politics. Democratic politics is a liberation of man, which can mobilize man's creativity and initiative to open up the way for the development of productive forces. In the 40 years since the founding of the country, although China has established a democratic politics with the people as the masters of the country on the basis of public ownership, in reality, the contradiction between principles and practices is prominent, the infringement of citizens' legal rights often occurs, the suppression of democracy and retaliation are common, the ideas of privilege and hierarchy still have a considerable market, the channels for public participation and the expression of public opinion are not smooth, and administrative management often replaces self-government of the masses, etc., which seriously dampens the enthusiasm and initiative of the people and also reflects the defects of the imperfect democratic forms and vague democratic procedures in China. The forms and procedures for realizing democracy involve political openness, citizen participation, citizen rights, electoral system, government authority, government mechanism, legal system, power checks and balances, etc. We have the conditions to establish and improve the system through promoting the reform of the political system and improve the degree of realization of democracy. At present, we should especially realize the openness of major decisions, the openness of procedures and results of work, broaden the channels for consultation and dialogue, and enhance the transparency of politics; implement differential elections inside and outside the party, improve the supervision and checks and balances mechanism; improve the procedural law with the constitution as its basic content, so as to facilitate execution and operation, etc.

In summary, based on China's current environmental conditions, we should regard the construction of socialist democratic politics as a gradual, cumulative process and should not, regardless of objective and subjective conditions, forcefully do those high-target, unachievable things. But we should not stick to the old ways and stagnate, but must strive to create conditions and actively and cautiously push forward China's socialist democratic politics construction.

    社会主义民主政治建设：一个有序的探索过程
    郑剑楚
    党的十三大报告指出：“建设社会主义民主政治同发展社会主义商品经济一样，是一个逐步积累的渐进过程”。本文试图通过对民主政治历史发展的回顾，通过对民主政治自身发展的探索，通过对现实民主政治建设环境的剖析，为深化我国社会主义民主政治建设的问题谈一点认识，并求教于大家。
    在人类历史上，一定国家形态民主政治的确立和完善是一个长期的过程
    列宁指出：“民主是一种国家形式，一种国家形态。”（《列宁选集》第3卷，257页）可见，所谓民主政治，即作为政治制度的民主，首先是一个历史范畴，是一定国家形态的政治制度。它在人类社会发展历史上，经过不同的发展阶段，表现为不同的内容和形式，经历过一个由低级到高级、由残缺不全到不断完善的漫长历程。
    奴隶社会、封建社会的统治形式有君主制和共和制两种，但其基本形式是君主独裁。曾经出现过的共和制，如公元前六世纪至公元前一世纪的罗马共和国，古希腊的斯巴达共和国，雅典民主共和国，以及欧洲中世纪产生的威尼斯、热那亚、佛罗伦萨等封建共和制的城邦国家，也未摆脱奴隶制、封建制的历史局限，其本质仍然是奴隶主和贵族的统治，民主也只能是少数人的特权。
    现代资本主义社会，使剥削阶级的民主政治发展到了顶峰。早期资产阶级的启蒙思想家们就明确提出过“自由、平等、博爱”、“法律面前人人平等”的口号，为建立资本主义民主政治制度奠定了思想基础。商品经济的发展，使资产阶级民主政治制度的确立具备了决定性的客观条件。这以后的400年间，资产阶级开始了建设其民主政治的艰辛历程。从法国资产阶级革命，到整个资本主义民主政治的确立和巩固，既经历过数次大的资产阶级革命，又经受了两次世界大战的磨难，才逐步形成了一整套以议会制为核心，包括“三权分立”、“普选制”、“多党制”为主要内容的民主政治体制。资本主义民主政治的日臻完善，虽然是一种巨大的历史进步，但对广大的无产阶级和劳动人民来说，实质上仍然“是一种残缺不全的、贫乏的和虚伪的民主，是只供富人、只供少数人享有的民主”（《列宁选集》第3卷，248页）。
    社会主义民主政治，从本质上区别于剥削阶级的民主政治。正因为如此，新型的社会主义民主政治建设的道路并非坦途，也不可能在短期内达到理想的境界。第一个社会主义国家苏联，虽然为建立社会主义民主政治制度开辟了道路，但在70多年实践中，步履艰难，出现过不少的失误。还有一些社会主义国家，民主政治建设大都经历了40多年的发展过程，但建立完全意义上的社会主义民主政治的道路还相当遥远。我国虽然创立了以人民代表大会制度为核心的社会主义民主政治体制，但实现民主的形式和程序都还很不健全，建设社会主义民主政治的任务同样十分艰巨。
    前不久，极少数人策动在首都和其它部分城市的动乱和北京的反革命暴乱，他们的目的绝不是要在中国推进社会主义民主政治的建设，而是打着民主的旗号破坏民主和法制，破坏安定团结的政治局面。如果他们的阴谋得逞，什么改革开放，什么民主法制，什么现代化建设，都将成为泡影，中国将出现一次历史的大倒退。
    回顾历史上各种形态的民主政治的产生、发展、更迭过程，给予我们很大的启示和教益：
    第一，一定国家形态的民主政治是一种历史的选择，也受制于当时的历史条件和本国的国情。在漫长的历史长河中，不论是民主思潮还是民主政治，都是伴随着商品交换的产生而产生的，也是伴随着商品交换的发展而发展的。一定国家形态的民主政治不取决于当时人们的主观愿望，而主要取决于当时的社会经济条件。现阶段我国的社会主义民主政治建设，必须立足于现实的经济社会基础，而不能以“最纯粹”、“最广泛”、“最真实”等抽象的主观的愿望为标准、为目标。
    第二，一定国家形态的民主政治，都有其具体的阶级内容，即它所反映的一定阶级的利益和要求。资本主义的民主政治虽已达到了剥削阶级民主政治的顶峰，但实质上所维护的仍然是资产阶级的根本利益。考察一定国家形态的民主政治状况，如果仅仅着眼于实施范围、实现程度、发展速度、层次分布等量的方面和表现形式，就会导致离开本质和内容空谈形式的片面性，陷入追求“抽象民主”或“一般民主”的泥坑，甚至走向邪路，这是十分不利于我国的社会主义民主政治建设的。
    第三，一定国家形态的民主政治建设需要经历一个长期的过程，这是普遍的历史规律。历史使我们看到，一定国家形态民主政治的产生和完善，都经过了少则几百年、多则上千年的漫长历程。建设与剥削阶级民主政治有本质区别的社会主义民主政治，也必然经历一个产生、发展、完善的长期过程，任务更为艰巨，更不能设想一蹴而就。
    从其自身发展看，民主政治建设是一个有序和渐进的过程
    作为国家形式的政治民主制度，都是具体的社会存在，经历了自身发展的不同历史阶段，有着自身发展的规律和特点。我们认为，这些规律和特点，突出地表现为有序性和探索性、渐进性和彻底性。
    有序性和探索性。有序性，指一定国家形态的民主政治建设，受法定的、可遵循的程序和规则约束，在有领导有步骤的情况下进行。这是由民主的阶级本质决定的。资本主义国家的宪法和法律，一面宣称“主权在民”，一面又规定“私有财产神圣不可侵犯”，既力图把民主政治的发展牢固在私有制的根基上，又企图把无产阶级和广大人民的民主要求约束在资产阶级民主的范围之内。社会主义的民主政治，既包括广泛的人民民主，也包括对敌人的专政，它的发展同样应该是有序的，而不是无政府主义的。
    探索性，既是认识发展的一般规律，也是民主政治发展的重要特点。作为国家制度的民主，在阶级本质上曾历经数次更迭，在外在形式上却不断得到补充、发展和完善，本身的发展就是一部探索史。统治阶级在不断探索中完善其统治形式，在客观上为民主政治建设提供着量的积累；而广大劳动群众对民主理想的不懈追求和斗争，也为最终建立多数人的新型民主制度准备了条件。民主自身的发展，从人民参与到人民自治的各个历史阶段，有序性提供了相对稳定的社会条件，探索性开辟着继续前进的道路。
    渐进性和彻底性。作为国家形式的民主政治制度，从产生到完善是个长期积累的过程。在一定历史时期的民主政治制度中，既包含有对以往成果的批判继承，更包含着自身的完善和升华，不经历一个长期的渐进过程是难以完成的。
    彻底性，则是无产阶级民主政治内在本质的一般表现。社会主义公有制的建立是人民当家做主的基础，是无产阶级创建比资产阶级更为先进的民主的主要依据。无产阶级的民主政治，对于资产阶级民主是一种质的否定，是有史以来一种最高类型的民主，也是一种彻底的政治平等。但是，胜利的无产阶级革命创建的社会主义国家，生产力比较落后，社会主义商品经济的发展成熟需要一个较长的历史过程。与此相联系，社会主义民主政治自身的发展中，还要同封建主义残余和旧的传统观念实行彻底的决裂，还要对资产阶级民主观念进行分析和批判，只有这样，才能为建设高度的民主政治创造必要的条件。可见，这种彻底性寓于渐进性之中，并通过渐进性来实现，贯穿于社会主义民主政治建设的全过程。
    通过上述对民主政治制度发展的基本规律和特点的探讨，使我们初步形成了对社会主义民主政治建设的三点认识：
    （一）作为一种新型的人民民主，社会主义民主政治建设需要经历一个积极探索前进的过程。社会主义民主政治第一次把多数人统治的民主理想变为现实，其阶级本质是进步的、革命的，也是优越于任何剥削阶级民主政治制度的。与此相适应，实现政治民主的形式和程序也应是相对完善的、健全的。但综观社会主义国家以往民主政治建设的实践，事实并非如此。虽然经过几十年的历史发展，人民当家作主的理想并未能在完全意义上实现，其优越性也未能使人民真切地感受到，进程反而呈现出迟滞。究其原因，受客观条件制约固然是重要的方面，但固守僵化的模式，缺乏探索的精神，不能不说是一个重要的因素。在我国，这种矛盾突出地表现在，强调国体的重要性、忽视人民代表大会的作用，强调实体民主、忽视程序民主等方面，导致决策不够民主、选举制度可变性大、监督机制不健全、协商对话不规范、有关法律操作性差等等，影响了民主政治实施的范围和实现的程度。解决这个问题，首先应通过自身改革，逐步完善民主实现的形式和程序，使社会主义民主政治日趋协调，优越性得到充分发挥。
    （二）作为自身基础上的自我完善，社会主义民主政治建设要与法制建设结合起来进行。社会主义制度的建立，为民主政治建设提供了前提条件。在此基础上的民主政治建设，不再是一个阶级推翻另一个阶级的“政治大革命”，也不再是人民自发地进行活动和斗争，而是有领导、有步骤、有秩序地进行。提高民主政治实现的范围和程度，无疑需要广泛倡导民主、张扬民主，但也需要安定的社会环境，否则，人民民主就无法实现。同时，民主与法制密不可分，民主，只有法律化、制度化，才能最终得以实现。如果背离有序性这一民主政治建设的重要特点，其后果很可能是对社会主义民主的破坏。因此，我国的民主政治建设，应立足于全体人民的切身利益，在坚持四项基本原则的前提下，把民主与法制结合起来，有领导、有计划、有步骤地展开。
    （三）作为发展史上的最高类型，社会主义民主政治建设必须逐步推进。我国是一个封建制度历史很长的国家，商品经济不发达，法制不完备，教育长期落后，国民的文化水平普遍低下，封建传统积习很深，使推进民主政治的任务更为艰巨，难度也很大。这就需要我们作出坚韧不拔的努力，排除来自各方面的干扰，统一思想、统一政策、统一步骤、统一方法、统一行动，脚踏实地的把民主政治建设推向前进。
    从现实条件来看，民主政治建设需要一个逐步积累的过程
    谈及我国的民主政治建设或发展，很有必要对现阶段物质和精神的社会条件以及民主政治的现状有个基本的认识。
    我们知道，经济基础不仅决定着民主政治的本质，还制约着其实现程度。我国经过40年的建设，国民经济有了长足发展，特别是十年改革成绩斐然，这是有目共睹的实事。但从总体上看，生产力水平低且发展不平衡，整个商品经济发展还处在初始阶段，这就是我们面临的现实。这一决定性的因素，影响民主主体力量的发展和民主素质的提高，制约着我国现阶段的民主政治建设。突出地表现在：相对独立的商品生产者和经营者还没有真正形成，制约官僚主义的力量薄弱；人民的民主与自由权利的实际享有和充分行使，还缺少足够的物质保证；人民缺乏建立在经济利益基础上的独立的政治人格和主体意识；人们的等价交换、自由选择、自由竞争、机会均等等观念意识缺乏，传统政治文化向民主化的转变缓慢，等等。总之，我国社会主义初级阶段商品经济不发达的状况，直接影响着民主政治建设的进程。
    民主政治的发展，不仅要受社会经济条件的限制，还受到精神文明状况的制约，包括思想、文化素质、社会公德等方面。我国曾是“礼义之邦”，十年改革适应商品经济的发展，精神文明建设也取得了一定成绩。但从现阶段的状况来看，由于对这个问题抓得不够有力，精神文明建设方面出现了“滑坡”。这个问题解决不好，我国的社会主义民主政治建设就会缺乏民主的理想、民主的精神、民主的文化、民主的责任、民主的保障，在发展的道路上就容易出现挫折。
    立足于我国的现实条件，我国的社会主义民主政治建设，当前应抓好这样几项工作：
    首先，要把发展生产力、繁荣社会主义的商品经济放在首位。商品经济作为近代民主政治的经济基础，无疑也是社会主义民主政治发展的基础条件。特别是在我们这样一个处于社会主义初级阶段的经济文化落后的国家，为了奠定民主政治的坚实基础，必须坚定地以发展生产力、繁荣社会主义经济为中心，那种片面追求高度民主和个性自由发展，是不切实际的幻想。
    第二，突出教育的战略地位，推进社会主义精神文明建设。民主政治建设离不开国民素质的提高，离不开民族文化的现代化。教育落后、精神文明“滑坡”，是几年来的一大失误。鉴于此，更应适度调整建设布局，把教育放在突出的战略地位，不断提高全民族的科学文化水平和思想政治素质。与此同时，要加强和改善整个国民教育，加强精神文明建设，以促进人们内在精神的觉醒和升华，促使人们的观念意识和行为方式进入现代化轨道，促使广大公民从封建的传统政治文化中挣脱出来，促使人们善于认清资产阶级民主的实质，坚定社会主义民主的理想，确立民主的精神，负起民主的责任，形成有利于民主的法制观念和社会道德观念。
    第三，在坚持进行经济体制改革的同时，坚定不移地推进政治体制改革。在现阶段，要发展我国的商品经济，必须改革与之不相适应的旧经济体制，舍此别无选择；而经济体制改革又呼唤着政治体制改革与之协调配套，需要在党政分开、改革干部人事制度、改革企业领导体制、政府职能转变、机构改革等方面迈出实质性的步子。对于我国的社会主义民主政治建设来说，经济体制改革创造着条件，政治体制改革开辟着道路，二者缺一不可。目前，我国的改革遇到了众所周知的困难，但不能因此而失去信心。停顿改革而导致旧体制的复归，那将是更大的“痛苦”。不仅民主政治将成为无本之木而无从谈起，甚至还会断送社会主义事业。
    第四，从完善民主的实现形式和程序着手，推进我国社会主义民主政治的进程。民主政治是一种人的解放，它可以调动起人的创造性和积极性，去为生产力的发展开辟道路。建国40年来，我国虽然在公有制基础上建立了以人民当家做主为核心的民主政治，但现实生活中原则与实践相背离的矛盾比较突出，公民合法权益受到侵犯的事件时有发生，压制民主、打击报复的行为屡见不鲜，特权思想、等级观念还有相当市场，民众参与、民意上达的渠道不畅，行政管理常常取代群众自治等等，严重挫伤了人民群众的热情和积极性，也反映了我国民主形式不健全、民主程序太笼统的积弊。民主实现的形式和程序，涉及政治开放，公民参政，公民权利，选举制度，政府权限，政府机制，法律体系，权力制衡等诸多方面。我们完全有条件通过推进政治体制改革来建立健全制度，提高民主的实现程度。在当前，特别要实现重大决策公开，办事制度和结果公开，广辟协商对话渠道，增强政治的透明度；实行党内外的差额选举，完善监督制衡机制；完善以宪法为基本内容的程序法，以便于执行和操作，等等。
    综上所述，从我国现实的环境条件出发，我们要把社会主义的民主政治建设看作一个逐步积累的渐进过程，而不能不顾主客观条件勉强去做那些高目标、办不到的事。但也不能墨守成规，停滞不前，而必须努力创造条件，积极慎重地把我国的社会主义民主政治建设推向前进。
