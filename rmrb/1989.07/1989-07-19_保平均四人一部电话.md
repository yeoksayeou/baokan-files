Bulgaria leads all socialist countries in telephone availability, with an average of one direct-line telephone for every four people.

According to the latest data from the Bulgarian Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, the country, with a total population of 8.98 million, currently has 2.5 million direct-line telephones. This is nearly 90 times more than at the time of the country's founding 45 years ago. In the capital city of Sofia, in addition to the public telephones seen everywhere on the streets and alleys, 64% of households have direct-dial telephones installed.

Now, residents of major cities in Bulgaria can directly call friends and relatives in 36 countries across Europe, North America, and Asia from their homes. Domestic calls, except for a few remote rural areas, are all automatically dialed.
