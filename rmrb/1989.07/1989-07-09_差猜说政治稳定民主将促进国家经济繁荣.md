    Chatchai says political stability and democracy will promote national economic prosperity. Our reporter Liu Aicheng reports from Bangkok on July 9th: Thai Prime Minister Chatchai summarized and analyzed the economic situation, pointing out that a stable and democratic political system will lead to national economic stability and prosperity.

    Chatchai made the above remarks yesterday at the annual meeting of the Thai Students Association. He said, "A stable and democratic political system will necessarily lead to national economic stability and prosperity." He continued, "Currently, Thailand's economy is developing rapidly. Over the past 18 years, Thailand's economy has grown tenfold. In 1970, Thailand's GDP was only about 136 billion baht (25 baht is approximately 1 US dollar), but by 1988 it had increased to over 1440 billion baht. Meanwhile, per capita income also rose from 3,600 baht in 1970 to over 26,400 baht in 1988."

    Chatchai analyzed the global situation, pointing out that the international landscape has changed. From confrontation to dialogue, international conflicts and tensions are gradually easing. Countries around the world are now focusing on developing their economies and improving the living standards of their people. Thailand should follow this global trend, actively expand foreign trade, and promote even greater national economic prosperity.
