Implementing the Autonomy Rights Granted by the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy
Ethnic Regions See a New Prosperous and Flourishing Scene

According to materials provided by the research group of the National People's Congress Standing Committee on Ethnic Affairs, the promulgation of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" and the subsequent issuance and implementation of supporting regulations and laws by various ethnic autonomous regions have effectively safeguarded the autonomy rights of various ethnic minorities. This has significantly promoted the development of political, economic, and cultural construction in ethnic regions, with many ethnic regions beginning to show signs of prosperity and development.

Statistics show that out of the 154 ethnic autonomous regions nationwide, 20 autonomous prefectures and 25 autonomous counties have formulated local autonomy regulations and had them approved and implemented by the standing committees of the people's congresses of their respective provinces or autonomous regions. Meanwhile, provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, Gansu, Guangdong, and Hubei, which have ethnic autonomous regions within their jurisdiction, have already formulated several regulations to implement the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy."

The implementation of the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" and these supporting regulations have been warmly welcomed by ethnic minority cadres and masses in various autonomous regions. They say, "The Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy is a concentrated embodiment of the Party and the state's policy of ethnic equality and unity, and a guarantee for the prosperity and common prosperity of all ethnic groups."

According to investigations, since the implementation of the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" in October 1984, 40 new ethnic autonomous regions have been established. The number of ethnic minorities practicing regional ethnic autonomy has increased by 5, namely Manchu, She, Gejia, Maonan, and Pumi. The number of ethnic minorities exercising regional ethnic autonomy has increased from 40 to 45. The population of ethnic minorities practicing regional ethnic autonomy accounts for 79% of the total ethnic minority population. Moreover, it has also enabled ethnic minority groups in scattered and mixed residential areas to enjoy the autonomous rights stipulated by the state constitution and laws. Currently, more than 1,500 ethnic townships have been established nationwide, allowing all ethnic minorities in the country to fully enjoy equal ethnic rights.

In the process of earnestly implementing the autonomy rights granted by the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" and the Party's ethnic policies, various autonomous organs have maintained the interests and rights of local ethnic minorities. This has greatly stimulated the initiative, upward striving spirit, and self-confidence of the people of all ethnic groups, strengthening ethnic unity and cohesion. Their awareness of loving the Party, the motherland, and socialism has continuously increased, and their determination to contribute to the realization of the Four Modernizations has grown stronger.

    执行《民族区域自治法》赋予的自治权利
    民族地区出现兴旺发达新局面
    据新华社北京7月27日电  （记者格来）据全国人大民委调研组提供的材料，《中华人民共和国民族区域自治法》的颁布和各民族区域自治地方配套条例、法规的陆续出台、实施，有力地保障了各少数民族的自治权利，大大促进了民族地区政治、经济、文化等各项建设事业的发展，不少民族地区开始出现兴旺、发达的新局面。
    据统计，目前全国154个民族自治地方已有20个自治州、25个自治县制定出本地方自治条例并经所在省、自治区人大常委会批准实施。同时，辖有自治地方的四川、云南、青海、甘肃、广东、湖北等6个省人大常委会或省人民政府已制定了贯彻《民族区域自治法》的若干规定。
    《民族区域自治法》的贯彻落实和这些配套法规的制定和实施，深受各自治地方少数民族干部、群众的欢迎。他们说：“民族区域自治法是党和国家民族平等、团结政策的集中体现，是各民族兴旺发达，共同繁荣的保障”。
    据调查，1984年10月实施《民族区域自治法》以来，新建了40个民族自治地方，实行民族区域自治的少数民族新增加了5个，即满、畲、仡佬、毛南、普米等。行使民族区域自治权的少数民族由40个增加到45个。实行区域自治的少数民族人口占全部少数民族人口的79％。而且还为散杂居地区的少数民族群众也能享受到国家宪法和法律规定的自主权，目前全国已建起了1500多个民族乡，使全国的各少数民族充分享有民族平等的权利。
    各地自治机关在认真贯彻执行《民族区域自治法》赋予的自治权利和党的民族政策过程中，由于维护了当地少数民族利益、民族权利，极大地激发了各民族人民奋发、向上的进取心，民族自尊心、自信心不断增强，民族团结、民族凝聚力更加巩固，热爱党、热爱祖国、热爱社会主义的觉悟不断提高，为实现四个现代化努力做贡献的决心更大。
