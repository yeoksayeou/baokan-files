A 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck Batang County in Sichuan Province today. According to the China Earthquake Networks Center and the Sichuan Seismological Bureau, the quake occurred at 12:09 PM Beijing time. The epicenter was located southeast of the county seat, at 29.9 degrees north latitude and 99.23 degrees east longitude. Preliminary reports indicate that three buildings in the county seat have collapsed. As of now, there is no information on casualties, and communication with the affected area has been disrupted. Details are still being investigated.

This is the second significant earthquake to hit Batang County this year. The first occurred on April 16, with a magnitude of 6.7.

According to reports, there have been numerous aftershocks following the earthquake. As of 2:55 PM today, there have been two earthquakes of magnitude 4, one of magnitude 3, and 113 of magnitude 1. Experts believe that the frequent aftershocks indicate that underground energy is being gradually released, suggesting that a larger earthquake is unlikely in the near future.

Additionally, the Sichuan Seismological Bureau has dispatched professionals to the earthquake site in Batang.

    巴塘发生5.8级地震
    伤亡情况尚在调查中
    新华社成都7月21日电　（记者刘晓行）根据国家地震局和四川地震台网测定，今天北京夏令时12点零9分四川省巴塘县发生5.8级地震，震中位于县城东南、北纬29度54分、东经99度14分的地区。据初步了解，县城已发现3栋房屋倒塌。目前，尚未了解到人员伤亡情况，外界与震中区的电话已经中断。详细情况正在进一步调查之中。
    这次地震是巴塘县今年发生的第二次较强地震。第一次是4月16日发生的6.7级地震。
    据有关方面报告，这次地震后的余震较多。截至今天14点55分，已有4级地震2次、3级地震1次、1级地震113次。此间专家认为，按一般规律，余震较多说明地下能量正在逐渐释放出来，预示着近期不会出现更大的地震。
    另据悉，四川省地震局已派专业人员赴巴塘地震现场。
