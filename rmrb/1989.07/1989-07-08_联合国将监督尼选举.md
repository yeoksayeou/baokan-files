The United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today sent a letter to the President of the Security Council, stating that he has decided to dispatch an observer mission to Nicaragua to examine the election procedures there.

The Secretary-General stated in his letter that this decision was made based on the request from Nicaragua and the findings of the investigative team he sent earlier this year.

Meanwhile, the Secretary-General's spokesperson also announced today that over the weekend, the Secretary-General will send another investigative team to Nicaragua to negotiate with the Managua government regarding the size and composition of the observer mission. The observer mission is scheduled to arrive in Nicaragua on August 25.

The mission's task is to check whether the proportional representation of various political parties in Nicaragua's election commission and its affiliated agencies is balanced, and to verify whether various political parties in Nicaragua enjoy the freedom to organize and propagate without obstruction or threat.

Nicaragua's permanent representative to the United Nations, Caldera, stated that the Nicaraguan government has agreed to all the Secretary-General's requirements. Nicaragua hopes that the general election can be held no later than February of next year.
