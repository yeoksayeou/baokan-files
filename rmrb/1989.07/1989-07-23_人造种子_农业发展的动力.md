After years of cultivation, developed countries have produced large, tender hybrid celery with a delicious taste and fewer coarse fibers that get stuck in teeth, making it very popular. Unfortunately, hybrid celery seeds are small and few in number, and they germinate very slowly. In recent years, with the development of artificial seed technology, this problem has been solved. Celery artificial seeds, resembling small, translucent gelatin capsules, can be planted directly into the soil to germinate and grow into large, tender hybrid celery.

In recent years, artificial seeds have become a hot topic in the high-tech field, with developed countries investing heavily in research. Artificial seed technology is derived from tissue culture and cell culture techniques, with its theoretical basis dating back to the early 20th century when the German scientist Haberlandt proposed the theory of plant cell totipotency. This theory suggests that every cell in a plant has the potential to develop into a complete plant. This theory was first verified in 1958. Scientists successfully cultivated plants from carrot root cells. Subsequently, more and more plant tissues or cells were cultivated into plants in test tubes, with over 1,000 plant species now successfully cultured. Over the past decade, this technology has entered practical use, forming the so-called test-tube seedling industry, and industries such as sugarcane seedlings, banana seedlings, tree seedlings, and floriculture have emerged, becoming one of the leading high-tech industries.

In the early 1980s, during the production of test-tube seedlings, scientists discovered that plant tissues or cells, when placed in a culture medium, would form a callus-like tissue similar to that which develops when a plant is injured, within a few days under the stimulation of plant hormones and other substances. The cells in the callus are relatively primitive, and their genes can be fully expressed. The callus can undergo two types of changes: it can directly produce roots, stems, and leaves, growing into a young seedling, or it can develop into an embryo-like structure similar to that found in a natural seed. The embryo-like structure can then germinate and grow into a plant, just like a natural seed. In recent years, these attempts have been successful, and artificial seeds have been born. People have wrapped the delicate embryo-like structures in an artificial seed coat, which contains the nutrients needed for the embryo to sprout and a protective layer made of high-molecular materials, thus creating the small gelatin capsules. The artificial seed coat is water-soluble and will automatically dissolve when planted in the soil, allowing the embryo-like structure to sprout under nutrient-rich conditions.

This high-tech innovation is highly valuable. First, for those excellent crop varieties that are difficult to seed or have low natural seed germination rates or are infertile, artificial seed technology can solve the problem of promoting cultivation. Second, artificial seeds can be produced industrially, and their germination, growth, and maturation periods are accurate and uniform, making management easier. Furthermore, people can use the intermediate steps in the production of artificial seeds to cultivate high-quality seeds and add growth-stimulating and pest-resistant substances to the artificial seed coat. Additionally, the use of artificial seeds can save a significant amount of seed grain.

Given the bright prospects of artificial seeds, countries are competing to research and have already achieved success in crops such as carrots, celery, citrus, coffee, cotton, corn, and rice. Some countries are developing packaging and transportation systems to bring artificial seeds to market as soon as possible, aiming for full commercialization. Artificial seed technology may enable the ancient planting industry to enter a stage of "asexual seed planting."

    人造种子——农业发展的动力
    李建新
    经过多年培育，发达国家种植业生产出了大而嫩的杂种芹菜，味美而较少塞牙缝的粗纤维，大受欢迎。遗憾的是，杂种芹菜的种子少而小，发芽极慢。近年来，由于人造种子技术的发展，此问题已获得解决。芹菜人造种子，状如小鱼肝油丸的半透明小胶丸，将它植入土地便可发芽生根，很快长成大而嫩的杂种芹菜。
    近几年，人造种子成为高技术领域中的一个热点，发达国家均大力研究。人造种子技术脱胎于组织培养和细胞培养技术，其理论依据最早出自本世纪初德国科学家哈贝尔兰德的植物细胞全能性理论，即认为植物的每一个细胞均具有发育成一棵植株的能力。此理论于1958年首次获得验证。科学家们用胡萝卜根部细胞育成了植株。随后，越来越多的植物的组织或细胞被人们在试管中培养成植株，迄今已达1千多种植物。近10多年来，这项技术进入实用，形成了所谓的试管苗工业，并且出现了甘蔗苗、香蕉苗、树苗、花卉等有利可图的试管苗产业，成为高技术产业中的佼佼者之一。
    80年代初期，在生产试管苗的过程中，科学家们发现，植物组织或细胞进入试管内的培养基以后在植物激素等物质的刺激下，几天之内便可形成一种类似于植物受伤之后新生的那种愈伤组织。愈伤组织的细胞较为原始，其基因可以全部表达出来，愈伤组织可能有二种变化方向，一是可以直接生出根、茎、叶，长成一棵幼苗。二是可能变成一个天然种子中的胚胎的胚状体，然后胚状体再像种子一样，发芽生根，长成植株。近几年，这种尝试获得了成功，人造种子诞生了。人们为娇嫩的胚状体包上了人工种皮，其中包含了胚状体萌芽所需的营养物质和由高分子材料构成的保护层，于是小胶丸便制成了。人工种皮是水溶性的，在植入土地后便自动溶解，于是胚状体在营养丰富的条件下，便可适时萌发成苗。
    此项高技术是十分有价值的。首先，对于那些制种困难或天然种子发芽率低或不育的优良作物品种，人造种子技术可以解决推广种植的难题。其次，人造种子可进行工业化生产，而且其发芽生长及成熟期准确统一，便于管理。再者，人们可利用生产人造种子的中间环节，培育良种，并且可以在人造种皮中加进刺激生长和防病虫害的物质。还有，采用人造种子可以节省大量种用粮食。
    鉴于人造种子的远大前景，各国争相研究，并已在胡萝卜、芹菜、柑桔、咖啡、棉花、玉米、水稻等作物方面相继获得成功。有的国家正在研制使人造种子进入市场的包装运输系统，以尽快达到全面商业化。人造种子技术将有可能使古老的种植业进入一个“无性系种植业”阶段。
