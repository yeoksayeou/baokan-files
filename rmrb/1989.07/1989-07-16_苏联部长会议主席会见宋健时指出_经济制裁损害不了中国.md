Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 15th.

Today at noon, Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov met with the delegation led by Song Jian, the head of the Chinese government delegation. Both sides exchanged ideas on strengthening Sino-Soviet scientific and technological cooperation in various fields and at various levels.

Song Jian, the State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission of China, outlined the significance and lessons of China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Ryzhkov expressed understanding of China's actions. When discussing the "sanctions" imposed by some Western countries on China, he said that in today's world, economic "sanctions" cannot harm a socialist power like China.

Song Jian expressed that the Chinese government hopes to fully develop scientific and technological cooperation between the two countries in three levels: traditional industries such as agriculture, light industry, and food; high-tech industries like aerospace, nuclear energy, biotechnology, and new materials; and basic scientific research. For example, in the aerospace field, it is possible to consider using the existing conditions of the Soviet Union to train Chinese astronauts and have astronauts from both countries go to space together.

Ryzhkov praised these ideas. He also pointed out that the current imbalance in the Soviet economy, particularly the backward state of food and light industry, if not overcome, will become a political and social psychological issue. The Soviet Union hopes to fully cooperate with China in these areas and sign formal documents. He said that as long as it is mutually beneficial to both countries, cooperation in various forms can be carried out.

Song Jian came to the Soviet Union to participate in the China Science and Technology Day activities that began on the 14th. Today, he also met separately with the President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Maruk, and the Chairman of the State Committee for Computer Technology and Information, Tolstykh.

    苏联部长会议主席会见宋健时指出
    经济制裁损害不了中国
    新华社莫斯科7月15日电　（记者盛世良）苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫今天中午在这里会见了中国政府代表团团长宋健一行，双方交换了在各领域、各层次加强中苏科技合作的设想。
    中国国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健概述了中国平息反革命暴乱的意义和教训。雷日科夫对中国的行动表示理解。他在谈到个别西方国家对中国采取的“制裁”行动时说，当今世界，经济“制裁”并不能损害中国这样的社会主义大国。
    宋健表示，中国政府希望在中苏各有所长的农业、轻工、食品等传统行业，宇航、核能、生物工程和新材料等高技术行业，以及基础科研3个层次上，全面开展两国的科技合作。例如，在宇航领域，可考虑运用苏联的现有条件培养中国宇航员，两国宇航员共同上天。
    雷日科夫对这些设想表示赞赏。他还指出，当前苏联经济发展不平衡，食品与轻工的落后状态如不克服，将成为政治和社会心理问题。苏联期望在这些领域同中国全面合作，签订正式文件。他说，只要对两国互利，各种方式的合作都可进行。
    宋健是为参加14日在这里开幕的中国科技日活动前来苏联的。今天他分别会见了苏联科学院院长马尔丘克和国家计算技术和信息委员会主席托尔斯特赫。
