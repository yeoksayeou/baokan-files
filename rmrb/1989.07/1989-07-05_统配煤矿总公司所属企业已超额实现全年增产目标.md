Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th.

The subordinate enterprises of the State-Administered Coal Mining Corporation have produced 887 million tons of raw coal in the first half of the year, significantly exceeding the initial goal of surpassing the planned production by 500 million tons for the entire year.

According to statistics, by the end of June, the total company had completed 17,440 million tons of raw coal production, achieving 51.8% of the annual plan, a 4.6% increase compared to the same period last year. The production of washed coal in the first half of the year reached 2,569 million tons, exceeding the target by 148 million tons.

General Manager Yu Hong'en has demanded that all coal miners remain vigilant and focus on maintaining stable production during the high-temperature and rainy season in the third quarter. The goal is to achieve an annual surplus of more than 1,000 million tons of raw coal, thereby increasing effective supply and easing the supply-demand tension.
