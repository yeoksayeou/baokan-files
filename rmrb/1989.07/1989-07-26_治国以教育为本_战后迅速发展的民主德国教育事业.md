Currently, the Democratic Republic of Germany (East Germany) has approximately 5,900 ten-year comprehensive schools, with all school-aged children attending. After completing the ten-year comprehensive education, 25% of students proceed to universities for further studies, while the rest almost entirely continue to receive a period of free vocational education. East Germany has always prioritized investment in education. Since 1971, the country has constructed 52,000 new teaching buildings, student dormitories, and 2,400 student gymnasiums.

The continuously developing education sector has provided a strong foundation for East Germany's steady economic growth. For many years, except for a few years, East Germany's economic growth rate has maintained a good momentum of 4% to 4.5%.

Strengthening students' political and ideological education is a significant feature of East Germany's basic education. Given the unique historical experiences of the German people and East Germany's special position in post-war international politics, East Germany places great emphasis on helping young students develop a correct historical perspective. The government's approach is to start with the thoughts of teachers, parents, and public opinion. Over the years, the East German government has continuously carried out anti-Nazi campaigns, creating a very favorable external environment for the healthy growth of students' thoughts. In addition, the authorities and schools have established historical exhibition halls, historical exhibition centers, and museums. Students can freely engage in activities, use exhibits, and even have classes here, thereby understanding and becoming familiar with the entire history of the German people, marked by both glory and shame. Here, teachers guide students in lively political discussions, helping them understand the connection between history and current politics, and cultivating their sense of political responsibility.

While strengthening historical education for students, East Germany also emphasizes cultivating students' communist ideology through labor education. As early as 1959, labor education was included in the then-incomplete curriculum of the ten-year comprehensive schools and gradually became a tradition in basic education. In East Germany, basic education is comprehensive technical education. Currently, approximately 770,000 middle school students receive comprehensive technical education in nearly 5,000 factories and work sites each year. Additionally, 1.5 million students participate in labor in various school-based labor groups and Red Scarf activity stations.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the German Democratic Republic. In this half-century of political turmoil, a great socialist democratic state has risen from the ruins of the fascist empire. People who were once deeply poisoned by Nazi ideology, along with their descendants, have undoubtedly become believers in communism, and education has played a crucial role.

The development of East Germany's education sector after the war has been arduous. Shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, the democratic government in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany quickly decided to restore basic education. At that time, the educational situation faced by the democratic government was very severe: 25% of school buildings were completely destroyed, and the rest were damaged to varying degrees; 40% of rural schools had only one teacher, and students of different ages were forced to attend classes in the same grade. The democratic government, through various forms of short-term training, cultivated a group of temporary teachers with democratic ideas from the working masses. Due to the lack of new textbooks and the inability to use fascist textbooks, the democratic government selected some relatively enlightened and progressive textbooks from the Weimar Republic period as temporary substitutes. Thus, everything was temporary, and the democratic education in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany began its difficult journey.

In the following years, the democratic government accelerated the repair of school buildings, printed textbooks, and strengthened the construction of the teaching staff. By the end of 1945, the publishing industry had printed 40 million copies of new textbooks promoting democratic ideas. Soon, 40,000 working people, after training, joined the ranks of democratic teachers, gradually alleviating the shortage of teachers. By the time the German Democratic Republic was established in 1949, most middle and primary school students had new textbooks. In 1951, East Germany established its first ten-year comprehensive schools, and scientific, detailed subject teaching began to enter the curriculum of these schools, with foreign languages becoming a required subject.

In 1959, East Germany formulated the law on developing socialist basic education, stipulating that ten-year comprehensive technical education is compulsory for all citizens. In 1965, based on continuous experience, a unified basic education system was established nationwide and has been in use ever since.

    治国以教育为本
    ——战后迅速发展的民主德国教育事业
    胡锡进
    目前，民主德国约有5900所十年制普通学校，所有适龄儿童都在学校上学。十年制学校毕业后，25％的学生升入大学继续深造，其余的人几乎全部继续接受一个时期的免费职业教育。民德历来重视教育投资，1971年以来，全国新建52000幢教学楼、学生宿舍和2400座学生体育馆。
    不断发展的教育事业为民德经济的稳步增长提供了后劲。多年来，除个别年份，民德的经济增长率一直保持了4％—4.5％的良好势头。
    加强学生的政治思想教育是民德基础教育的一个重要特点。鉴于德意志民族所经历的极不寻常的过去和战后民德在国际政治中所处的特殊地位，民德十分重视帮助青年学生建立正确的历史观。政府的做法是：首先，从老师、家长的思想和社会舆论抓起。多年来，民德政府不断开展反纳粹主义的运动，为学生思想的健康成长创造了极为有利的外部环境。此外，当局和学校设立了历史陈列室、历史展览中心和博物馆。学生在这里可以自由地活动，使用展品，甚至可以在这里上课，从而认识并熟悉整个德意志民族荣辱交织的过去。在这里，老师们引导学生开展热烈的政治讨论，帮助他们认识历史与现实政治的联系，培养他们的政治责任感。
    在加强对学生进行历史教育的同时，民德也注重通过劳动教育培养学生的共产主义思想。早在1959年，劳动教育就被写入当时尚不完善的十年制学校的教学大纲，并逐步成为普通基础教育的传统。在民主德国，普通基础教育就是综合技术教育。目前，每年约有77万名中学生在近5000个工厂和劳动工地上接受综合技术教育，另外还有150万名学生在各种校内劳动小组和红领巾活动站参加劳动。
    今年是第二次世界大战爆发50周年，也是德意志民主共和国成立40周年。在这政治风云变幻的半个世纪里，一个伟大的社会主义民主国家在法西斯帝国的废墟上崛起。曾经深受纳粹思想毒害的人们和他们的后代能够成为共产主义的信仰者，无疑，教育起了关键的作用。
    战后民德教育事业的发展经历了一番艰辛。1945年，二次大战结束不久，德国苏占区的民主政权迅速做出恢复基础教育的决定。当时，民主政权所面临的教育形势十分严峻：25％的校舍被彻底摧毁，其它大部分校舍也遭到不同程度的破坏；40％的农村学校只有一名教师，不同年龄的学生被迫在一个班级里上课。民主政权通过各种形式的短期集训，在劳动群众中培养出一批具有民主思想的临时教师。由于没有新教材，法西斯教材又不能用，民主政权选择了一些魏玛共和国时期的较为开明、进步的教材作临时替代课本。就这样，一切都是临时的，德国苏占区的民主教育开始了艰难的启程。
    在随后的几年里，民主政权加紧修复校舍，编印教材，加强教师队伍的建设。到1945年底，出版界赶印出400万册宣扬民主思想的新教材。很快有4万名劳动群众经过培训加入民主教师的队伍，师资紧张的局面逐步得到缓解。到1949年德意志民主共和国成立时，绝大多数中、小学生用上了新教材。1951年，民主德国成立了第一批十年制学校，科学的、细致的分科教学开始进入这些学校的教学大纲，外语成为这些学校的必设课程。
    1959年，民主德国制定了发展社会主义基础教育的法律，规定了十年制综合技术教育为全民义务教育。1965年，在不断总结经验的基础上，全国建立起统一的普通基础教育体系，并一直延用至今。（附图片）
