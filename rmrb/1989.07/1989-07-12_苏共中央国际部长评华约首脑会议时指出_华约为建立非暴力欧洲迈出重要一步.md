The head of the International Department of the CPSU Central Committee, Falin, today emphasized in his comments on the recent summit of the Warsaw Pact countries that transforming the Warsaw Pact from a military-political organization into a political-military organization is the most important step towards establishing a non-violent Europe.

Falin said in an interview with a reporter from the *Sovietskaya Rossiya* newspaper that the processes occurring within NATO are contradictory: the West, in many of its proposals, even when they are positive, places itself in a superior position to the East, attempting to gain advantages for NATO or individual NATO countries through bargaining or imposing conditions.

Falin pointed out that without abandoning this approach, it will be impossible to build a new, secure, peaceful Europe that is equally friendly to the people of every country living here.

Falin revealed that, in addition to discussing traditional international military and political issues, the problem of renewing socialism was given significant attention at the summit in Bucharest. Each country is carrying out reforms in its own way, although the pace and content differ, but reforms are taking place everywhere. Comparing various opinions, views, difficulties encountered, and accumulated experiences—this in itself is a major new phenomenon.

    苏共中央国际部长评华约首脑会议时指出
    华约为建立非暴力欧洲迈出重要一步
    新华社莫斯科7月12日电  苏共中央国际部长法林今天在评论最近举行的华约国首脑会议时强调指出，把华约从军事—政治组织转变成政治—军事组织是建立非暴力的欧洲道路上最重要的一步。
    法林在接受《苏维埃俄罗斯报》记者采访时说，北约内部正在发生的进程是矛盾的：西方在提出的许多建议，有时甚至是积极的建议中，都是把自己放在比东方更为优越的地位，企图通过讨价还价或把条件强加于人来使北约或北约的个别国家处于享有特权地位。
    法林指出，如果不抛弃这一点，那么就不可能建立一个新的、安全的、和平的、对居住在这里的每个国家的人民都一样友好的欧洲。
    法林透露，在布加勒斯特举行的首脑会议上除了讨论传统的国际军事和政治问题外，更新社会主义的问题在会上占了重要地位。每个国家都按自己的方式进行革新，虽然速度和内容不尽相同，但到处都在进行。把各种意见、观点、遇到的困难和积累的经验进行对比——这件事本身就是重大的新现象。
