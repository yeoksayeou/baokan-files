As the economic system reform shifts from rural areas to cities and from agriculture to industry, the friction between the old and new economic systems intensifies, and the macroeconomic environment deteriorates, new contradictions arise for agricultural development. Therefore, the stagnation in agriculture should be attributed to issues within the system reform.

Rural economy is a vast and complex "system," and an important part of the national economy. Currently, the sectoral management of the national economy places agriculture at a disadvantage. Departments related to agriculture include planning, finance, banking, chemical industry, commerce, grain, foreign trade, light industry, industry and commerce, taxation, pricing, and power supply. Under the guidance of national planning, these departments significantly influence resource allocation. The transition between old and new systems, along with the development of a planned commodity economy, has led to new behaviors in departments that previously operated under the old system. The conflicts between the interests and behaviors of departments and industries have become increasingly sharp. Both farmers and the state expect these departments to play a positive role in supporting and promoting rural economic development and to share some of the operational risks with farmers. However, driven by their own interests, these departments find it difficult to achieve this. Conversely, farmers' unpredictable economic behaviors leave departments at a loss. In agricultural investments, some departments responsible for supplying materials and funds fail to balance their own interests with the broader agricultural development. To maximize their own gains, they divert materials and funds to industries that yield quick profits. Some even engage in reselling agricultural supplies, arbitrarily raising prices, substituting inferior goods, and defrauding farmers to reap excessive profits, making it impossible for the state's agricultural investment plans to be fully and timely implemented. In extreme cases, some functional departments exploit farmers' need for agricultural products and supplies, demanding bribes under the guise of "internal rationality." Due to their monopolistic positions and the lack of unified management of profits and risks, their profit-seeking behaviors exacerbate the problem of low agricultural returns, hindering agricultural development. On the other hand, the trend of localizing state interests drives local governments to favor non-agricultural industries. After the implementation of the fiscal responsibility system, local governments, under fiscal pressure, are motivated to invest in short-term, high-yield projects to quickly boost fiscal revenue. Agricultural development, as a foundational industry, relies on central investments to fill the gaps. This further exacerbates the "urban bias." Local governments' investments in agriculture are at best sufficient for self-sufficiency. They focus on fiscal revenue and overlook agricultural development, hoping for increased investments from higher levels of government. This further weakens agriculture's position. Farmers are disheartened to find that when conflicts of interest arise between departments and farmers, the government used to mediate on behalf of the farmers. Now, the government often sides with fiscal revenue. Farmers' interests are not directly aligned with the government's, while departments' interests are closely tied to the government's. This is an intrinsic reason why departmental interventions in government behavior are often effective.

The "iron rice bowl" management system in agricultural administration places a heavy burden on the state. For instance, the grain management system, originally a centralized procurement and distribution system controlled by the central government over 800 million farmers, is now a contract-based procurement system, with only the volume of procurement and sales differing. Local governments bear no responsibility. The adjustment of grain surpluses and shortages has yet to break away from the "iron rice bowl" system, and the irrational situation where grain-deficit regions "consume" grain-surplus regions persists. On one hand, the central fiscal budget is strained, and on the other, whether in grain-producing regions or grain-deficit regions, no one is willing to pay the costs of increasing supply. The development of grain production remains the responsibility of the central government. To transfer grain to grain-deficit provinces, the central government must spend money, adopting measures such as building "grain-for-money" commercial grain bases. The fiscal "separate kitchen" management system contradicts the agricultural "iron rice bowl" system. Unless this contradiction is resolved, the enthusiasm of governments at all levels for agricultural development cannot be fundamentally mobilized.

To help agriculture escape its predicament and end its stagnation, it is necessary to fundamentally change the macro environment for agricultural development. In the construction of a new order for socialist commodity economy, it is essential to strengthen the government's and departments' behavior in favor of agriculture, establish a constraint mechanism for the government's macro management and control of the national economy, and help agriculture gradually escape the situation of being openly and covertly exploited. This is a high-level measure to help agriculture break free from stagnation.

Firstly, the relationship between the two major industries of industry and agriculture should be rectified. The relationship between industry and agriculture is the core issue of developing the national economy with agriculture as the foundation. This issue has not been properly addressed. Often, when agricultural products are in short supply, the importance of agriculture is emphasized, but when they are not, agriculture is deemed less important. In the new situation, there is a possibility of further deterioration. With population growth and resource depletion, prioritizing agricultural development has become an unavoidable task. Can we, like the initial strategy of prioritizing heavy industry after liberation, establish a national economic development strategy and corresponding economic management system that prioritizes agricultural development? This would ensure the development of agriculture as a foundational and weak industry. Under this strategic goal, the next step is to reconstruct the rural macro management system. In the early stages of economic system reform, only the interests of the central government, local governments, departments, and production operators were considered, without establishing a constraint mechanism. This led to unregulated behavior and economic disorder, exacerbating the conflicts between agriculture and other departments, making coordination difficult. Therefore, reconstructing a macro management system that adapts to the new rural economic situation becomes the task of the second phase of rural reform. This should include reducing the interference of government departments in local affairs; reducing the central government's fiscal input to local governments, weakening the local governments' reliance on the central government for funds and materials; readjusting the fiscal relationship between the state and local governments, gradually changing the ineffective cycle of the central government taking money from local governments and then returning it in the form of central investments. The core of agricultural issues is the production and circulation of grain, cotton, and oil. Can we change the management from a single central level to a two-level management system, with inter-provincial agricultural product circulation implemented through contracts? The central government should abandon its role as a "housewife" and use laws to regulate the activities and behaviors of local governments and departments. The central government's agricultural and commercial management departments should work closely together to formulate unified production and circulation plans and management norms. Thirdly, reform the fiscal system to solve the "iron rice bowl" problem in agriculture. The fiscal responsibility system is a reform of the old system, but it has brought about local and departmental consciousness. If only the local fiscal retention is increased without distributing the agricultural burden to local governments, the retained benefits will still not be used for agriculture, resulting in more intense conflicts between industry and agriculture under the drive of local fiscal goals. Currently, the connection point between the fiscal system and agricultural and commercial departments is the contract-based procurement. After promoting the graded management of agriculture, the contract-based procurement should be distributed to consuming provinces and cities along with the fiscal system. Local governments should have the decision-making power to adjust, within a certain range, the purchase prices, sales prices, sales prices of agricultural supplies, and sales prices of processed agricultural products. While the central government delegates power, it should also strengthen the behavioral norms of local governments, legally mandating the development of agriculture in the fiscal system.

    推动农业宏观管理的改革
    曾衍德　陆贵生
    随着经济体制改革由农村转向城市，由农业转向工业，新旧经济体制摩擦加剧，宏观经济环境恶化，也给农业发展带来新的矛盾。所以，农业徘徊要从体制改革中找原因。
    农村经济是一个规模宏大、结构复杂的经济“大系统”，也是国民经济体系中的一个重要方面，目前，实施的国民经济的部门化管理，使农业处于不利地位，现在与农业有关的部门包括计划、财政、银行、化工、商业、粮食、外贸、轻工、工商、税务、物价、供电等，在国家计划指导下，相当程度上左右着资源的配置。新旧体制转换，有计划商品经济的发展，使按旧方式活动的部门行为有了新的行为，部门、行业利益与行为缺陷使工农两大部门矛盾日益尖锐。本来农户和国家都期望部门对农村经济的发展起积极支持和推动作用，并为农户承担部分经营风险，但在部门自身利益的推动下，难以做到；而农户反过来又以其变幻不定的经济行为使部门无所适从。在农业投入中，有些承担物资、资金供应任务的部门，不能正确处理本部门利益与农业发展大局的关系，为了自身利益，将物资、资金集中转向那些见效快、利润高的行业；有的还参与农资转手倒卖，甚至随意抬高物价、以劣充优，克扣农民，从中牟取暴利，使国家对农业的投入计划不能如数、如期实现。更有甚者，有些职能部门在农产品和农业生产资料市场短缺的情况下，为着所谓“内部合理”的利益，向农民伸手要好处。由于这些行业、部门具有垄断地位，经营利益和风险不统一，其营利行为使农业报酬低这一问题强化了，影响农业的发展。另一方面，国家利益地方化倾向又促使地方政府向非农产业倾斜。地方财政包干之后，由于财政对地方的压力，使他们产生了短平快投资和高产值、高速度抓财政收入的动力，农业这一基础产业的发展则靠中央投资补齐。从而，驱使“城市偏向”更加突出。地方政府对农业的投入，充其量也只是解决自给自足，往往关心财政收入眼睛向下看，发展农业目光集中向上，县里希望省里增加投资，省里希望中央增加投资，农业的地位更加削弱。农民感到伤心的是：过去部门与农民发生利益冲突时，政府能够出来为农民讲几句公道话，现在变了，政府往往站到财政收入这一方面。农民的利益与政府的利益不直接，而部门的利益与政府的利益是绞在一起的。这是部门干预政府行为总能奏效的一个内在原因。
    农业管理的“大锅饭”体制把担子死死地压在国家身上。比如，粮食管理体制，原有的统购统销是中央政府对8亿农民，现在的合同定购仍然是中央政府对8亿农民，只是购销流通量不同，地方政府不承担责任。粮食的余缺调剂，至今没有打破地方吃中央“大锅饭”的局面，也没有改变调入地区“吃”调
  出地区的不合理状况。一方面是中央财政困难，另一方面无论是粮食主产区还是调入粮地区，都不愿支付增加供给的费用，发展粮食生产仍是中央的事。中央要调粮给缺粮省，就得花钱，已采取了建设“钱粮挂钩”的商品粮基地等形式。财政“分灶吃饭”与农业“大锅饭”相悖的管理体制不理顺，各级政府发展农业的积极性，就不可能根本地调动起来。
    农业走出困境，结束徘徊，必须从根本上改变农业发展的宏观环境。在社会主义商品经济新秩序的构造中，强化以“农业倾斜”的政府行为、部门行为的新体制，建立政府对国民经济宏观管理和调控的约束机制，帮助农业逐渐摆脱被公开和隐蔽索取的局面，是农业走出徘徊的高层次措施。
    首先，应该摆正工农两大产业的关系。工农业关系问题，是以农业为基础发展国民经济的核心问题。这个问题我们始终没解决好，往往是农产品供应不足时，就强调农业的重要性，相反，就不那么重要了，在新的形势下有进一步恶化的可能。人口膨胀，资源减少，优先发展农业已经成为摆脱不掉的任务。能否像解放初期“优先发展重工业”的国民经济发展战略及构造的相应经济管理体制那样，把优先发展农业作为国民经济发展战略，改革目前的经济管理体制，确保农业这个基础部门和弱质产业的发展。在这个战略目标下，其次就要重新构造农村宏观管理体系。经济体制改革初期，只强调兼顾中央、地方、部门、生产经营者的利益，而没有建立起一种约束机制，以致造成行为不规范，经济秩序混乱，农业与其他部门之间的矛盾愈演愈烈，难以协调。为此，重新构造适应农村经济发展新格局的宏观管理体系成为农村第二步改革的任务，这应包括消弱政府部门条条对地方块块的干预；消弱中央对地方的财政投入，促使地方伸手向中央要钱要物观念淡化；重新调整国家与地方的财政关系，逐步改变中央向地方要钱，再以中央投资形式返回给地方的无效循环。农业问题的核心是粮、棉、油生产与流通，可否改中央一级管理为二级管理，省际间农产品的流动实行合同制，中央政府改掉“家庭主妇”的角色，以法律来规范地方、部门的活动和行为。中央的农商管理部门密切合作，制定生产、流通合一的规划及管理规范。第三，改革财政体制，解决农业“大锅饭”问题。财政包干对旧体制是一种改革，但随之带来了地方、部门意识。如果仅增加地方财政留成，不把农业的包袱分解到地方，其留成利益仍然用不到农业上，其结果工业与农业的矛盾在地方化财政目标驱动之下更加尖锐。目前财政与农商部门的结合点是合同定购部分，在推进农业分级管理之后，把合同定购部分连同财政分解到消费省市。允许地方政府对农产品的购价、销价、农用物资销价、农产品加工制品销价等方面，在一定幅度内有自行调节的决策权。中央在放权的同时，强化地方政府的行为规范，把发展农业的财政以法律的形式规定下来。
