Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 5th.

The trial of the Iran-Contra case has concluded. Judge Gerald B. Gesell of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia today formally sentenced Oliver North, the central figure in the Iran-Contra affair and former assistant to the National Security Advisor, to three years of probation and a $150,000 fine. Gesell ordered North to perform 1,200 hours of community service, assisting with drug rehabilitation efforts for youth in the Washington, D.C. area.

Defendant North and his defense attorney attended today's sentencing. North later stated that he had served the country for over 20 years and had never intentionally done anything harmful to the nation. He requested an appeal to overturn his conviction.

Gesell stated during the sentencing that North was not a "scapegoat." He was convicted of three criminal charges: obstructing congressional inquiries, shredding and destroying White House documents. However, in the Iran-Contra affair, North was not a leader but rather a low-level employee who carried out orders from his superiors.

    “伊朗门”案审判结束
    诺思被判刑3年　罚款15万美元
    本报华盛顿7月5日电  记者仓立德报道：华盛顿联邦地区法院法官格塞尔今天正式宣判，依法判处“伊朗门”事件的核心人物、前白宫国家安全事务委员会助手诺思3年缓期徒刑及15万美元罚金。格塞尔命令诺思为居民无报酬服务1200小时，协助华盛顿市区青年的戒毒工作。
    被告诺思及其辩护律师出席了今天的宣判。诺思其后表示为国服务20余年从未有意干过一件有害国家的事；他要求上诉，以便推翻对他的判决。
    格塞尔在宣判时说，诺思不是“替罪羊”，他犯有阻碍国会调查、转移并销毁白宫文件等3项刑事罪；但在“伊朗门”事件中也不是领导者，而是按照上级旨意办事的低级工作人员。
