Recently, I visited the Zou County Plastic Products Factory in Shandong. The most interesting thing to me was the plastic antique-style furniture. As I entered the product display room with the owner, I saw several sets of exquisitely crafted plastic antique-style furniture, with beautiful patterns and an ancient charm. To my surprise, these products were made from discarded plastic agricultural film left in the fields.

Agricultural plastic film is widely used in crop cultivation, increasing the yield per unit of arable land and is popular among farmers. However, if the discarded agricultural plastic film is not promptly cleaned up, it will remain in the fields, polluting the farmland and affecting crop growth. The Zou County Plastic Products Factory recycles the discarded plastic film from the fields to produce antique-style furniture, reducing farmland pollution and opening up a new production avenue.

Factory director Shi Dinglun told me, "Originally, this factory mainly produced plastic woven bags, relying on imports for raw materials, which were expensive and had poor returns, and often lacked raw materials." In the spring of 1986, after conducting a market survey, they discovered that waste plastic agricultural film could be recycled. They then collaborated with relevant units, introduced technology, and designed the production of recycled plastic boxes, buckets, and furniture. After more than half a year of joint research, they finally produced fully plastic antique-style furniture. This furniture is small, elegant, does not crack or burst, is impact-resistant, and resistant to acid and alkali corrosion, making it sturdy and durable. The round tables, stools, and tea tables produced have surfaces adorned with special craftsmanship featuring ancient-style landscapes, flowers, and birds. Placing a set of antique-style furniture in a family living room or hotel lobby has both high ornamental and practical value. Over the past three years, they have produced more than 60,000 sets of plastic antique-style furniture, consuming 750 tons of waste plastic agricultural film and other materials, saving 1,400 cubic meters of wood, generating 1.8 million yuan in new output value, and 400,000 yuan in profit.

Shi Dinglun said that the future for plastic antique-style furniture is bright, with a large market demand both domestically and internationally. Currently, the entire factory is concentrating its financial and material resources to expand production on one hand, and on the other, to research and develop second-generation new products, establishing a fully plastic furniture production base. He revealed that the factory will also research and develop the use of sawdust and waste plastic to produce plastic packaging boxes that can replace wood.

    废旧农膜与仿古家具
    刘兆民
    前不久，我到山东邹县塑料制品厂采访，最使我感兴趣的要数塑料仿古家具了。笔者随同主人一起迈进产品展室，一套套制作精巧的塑料仿古家具，图案优美、古香古色。出乎我意料，这些产品竟是用遗弃在农田中的废旧塑料农膜生产出来的。
    农用塑料薄膜，广泛用于农作物栽培，提高了单位粮田产量，受到农民的欢迎。但是废旧农用塑料薄膜如果不及时清理，残留到田地中，会污染农田，影响农作物生长。邹县塑料制品厂回收残留在农田中的废旧塑料薄膜生产仿古家具，既减轻农田污染，又开辟了新的生产门路。
    厂长史顶伦告诉笔者说：“原来这个厂主要生产塑料编织袋，原料靠进口，价格高，效益不好，还时常缺原料。”1986年春，他们经过市场调查，发现废旧塑料农膜可以回收利用。于是他们和有关单位联系，引进技术，设计生产再生塑料盒、桶、家具。经过半年多的协同攻关，终于生产出了全塑仿古家具。这种家具，小巧别致、不裂不炸，抗冲击，耐酸碱腐蚀，结实耐用，生产的大小圆桌、圆凳、茶几，表面配有特殊工艺装帧的山水、花鸟等古香古色的图案，在家庭和旅馆会客厅放上一套仿古家具，具有较高观赏和实用价值。三年来，已生产塑料仿古家具6万多套，吃掉废旧塑料农膜等750吨，节约木材1400多立方米，新增产值180万元，利润40万元。
    史顶伦说，塑料仿古家具前景广阔，国内外市场需求量大，现在全厂正集中财力、物力，一方面扩大生产，一方面研制开发第二代新产品，建立全塑家具生产基地。他透露，厂里还将研究开发利用锯末和废旧塑料，生产可代替木材的塑料包装箱等产品。
