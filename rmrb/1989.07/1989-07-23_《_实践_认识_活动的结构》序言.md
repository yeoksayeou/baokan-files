Title: Foreword to "The Structure of 'Practice-Cognition' Activity"

Edition: 6

The unity of practice and cognition is a fundamental principle of Marxist epistemology. Over the years, scholars and researchers of Marxist philosophy have approached the issue of the unity of practice and cognition from various angles, providing numerous arguments, explanations, and studies, and achieving many results. Comrade Lu Jinning's doctoral dissertation, "The Structure of 'Practice-Cognition' Activity" (published by the PLA Press), also focuses on this issue. However, in terms of overall conception and methodology, his dissertation has unique and innovative aspects. The dissertation emphasizes that human practical activities and cognitive activities are essentially an indivisible, interwoven, unified activity process, and insists on examining them as a whole. To this end, the dissertation employs the methods of systems science (systems theory, information theory, cybernetics, etc.) to analyze the various elements of the unified "practice-cognition" activity of humans, studying how these elements interact and connect to form a structural system with intrinsic relationships, and how practical and cognitive activities develop together in depth through the interaction of these elements, ultimately bringing practical benefits to humans. In this way, the dissertation provides a more in-depth argument for the fundamental view of the unity of practice and cognition in Marxist epistemology. I and many comrades believe that such exploration is meaningful, an important step in adapting epistemological research to practical needs and modern scientific development, and worthy of praise.

The dissertation also offers many new insights and pioneering views in the discussion of specific issues in various chapters. For example, the dissertation's analysis of the rational elements in the practical philosophy of German classical philosophers, the discussion of the important position of the category of tools in Marxist philosophy, the three-tiered examination of the interaction between subjects and objects from shallow to deep, the emphasis on the need for practical concepts as a medium for the leap from rational cognition to practice, the revelation of several negative feedback loops that correct erroneous tendencies in "practice-cognition" activities, the study of the determinacy and indeterminacy of the starting point of "practice-cognition" activities, and the explication of the specific and historical unity of practice and cognition, truth and value, are all quite insightful and can provide many inspirations. Of course, the dissertation also has its shortcomings. This mainly lies in the fact that some chapters' discussions are somewhat generalized, and the philosophical elevation is still insufficient. This still awaits the author's further in-depth research.

Comrade Lu Jinning is the first cohort of doctoral students admitted by Renmin University of China. After three years of diligent study, he has made significant progress in his ability to independently engage in scientific research work. As his work is about to be published, I am pleased to sincerely wish him and many young and middle-aged philosophy workers more outstanding works to come.

    《“实践——认识”活动的结构》序言
    肖前
    实践和认识的统一，是马克思主义认识论的一条基本原理。多年来，马克思主义哲学的学习者研究者们从不同角度对实践和认识的统一问题作了种种论证、阐发和研究，取得了许多成果。卢冀宁同志的博士学位论文《“实践—认识”活动的结构》（已由解放军国防出版社出版）也致力于研究这个问题，然而从总体构思和方法上来看，他的论文都有新颖独到之处。论文强调了人的实践活动和认识活动本质上是一个不可分离的互相交织在一起的统一的活动过程，坚持必须对它们作总体考察。为此，论文运用系统科学（系统论、信息论、控制论等）的方法，从分析人的统一的“实践—认识”活动的诸要素入手，研究了这些要素如何交互作用和联结成具有内在联系的结构系统，实践活动和认识活动如何在这些要素的交互作用中共同向纵深发展，并最终给人带来实际利益。这样，就较为深入地论证了实践和认识的统一这个马克思主义认识论的基本观点。我和许多同志认为，这样的探索是有意义的，是使认识论的研究适应实践需要和现代科学发展的一个重要进展，是值得赞许的。
    论文在各章节许多具体问题的论述上也不乏新见解和开拓性。例如，论文对于德国古典哲学家的实践学说中的合理因素的分析，对于工具范畴在马克思主义哲学中重要地位的论述，对于主客体之间的相互作用由浅入深的三个层次的考察，对于实现从理性认识到实践的飞跃必须以实践观念为中介的强调，对于结果要素匡正“实践—认识”活动中错误倾向的几条负反馈回路运转机制的揭示，对于“实践—认识”活动起点的确定性和不确定性的研究，对于实践和认识、真理和价值的具体的历史的统一的阐发，都是相当有见地的，能给人们以诸多的启发。当然，论文也有缺点。这主要是个别章节的论述显得一般化，哲学升华还嫌不够。这尚有待作者今后继续作更深入的研究。
    卢冀宁同志是中国人民大学录取的首届博士生，通过三年踏实刻苦的学习，他在独立从事科学研究工作的能力上有了长足的进步。当他的著作即将出版之际，欣慰之余，我谨衷心祝愿他和众多的中青年哲学工作者有更多的佳作问世。
