Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd.

A study by the Criminal Science and Technology Research Institute of the Ministry of Public Security has shown that China has successfully applied genetic fingerprinting technology to the investigation and trial of specific cases such as homicide and rape.

Genetic fingerprinting refers to the basic genetic material, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), in humans. Among the world's over 5 billion people, only identical twins have the same DNA. Based on this principle, for homicide or rape cases, by collecting bloodstains or semen from the crime scene and comparing them with the suspect's blood sample through DNA extraction and processing, accurate conclusions can be drawn.

It is reported that the use of this technology has a probability of less than one in a hundred billion of misidentifying the criminal. In contrast, conventional methods such as blood type comparison lack high specificity and typically fail to identify the criminal in about 5% of cases.

Li Boqing, President of the Chinese Society of Forensic Medicine, believes that this research achievement is a major breakthrough in China's criminal investigation technology.

In addition to homicide and rape cases, this identification method can also be used to determine parentage in civil cases.

So far, relevant authorities have used this method to identify several dozen difficult cases sent from various regions, all of which have yielded accurate results.

    我遗传指纹鉴定成功用于刑侦
    新华社北京7月3日电（记者陈新）公安部刑事科学技术研究所的一项研究表明，我国已成功地将遗传指纹鉴定术应用于凶杀、强奸等具体案件的侦破与审理。
    遗传指纹即指人类基本遗传物质脱氧核糖核酸，世界上50多亿人中，除同卵多胞胎外，没有人相同。根据这个原理，对凶杀或强奸案只要将现场采集的血斑或精斑与嫌疑犯的血样，通过抽提脱氧核糖核酸进行处理比较，就能做出准确的结论。
    据介绍，运用这种技术不能确认罪犯的只有数百亿分之一，而目前常规的血型比较等方法均缺乏高度特异性，通常有5％左右无法确认罪犯。
    中国法医学会理事长李伯龄认为，这个研究成果是中国刑事侦察技术上的重大突破。
    据介绍，除了凶杀、强奸案外，这种鉴定方法还能对民事案件中的亲子认定作出判断。
    迄今为止，有关方面采用这种方法为各地送来的十几个疑难案件进行了鉴定，都得到了准确的结果。
