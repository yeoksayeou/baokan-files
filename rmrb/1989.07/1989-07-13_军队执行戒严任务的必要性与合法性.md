The swift suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing in early June has achieved decisive victory. Currently, social order in the capital and throughout the country has returned to normal. However, it is understood that some people still do not fully understand the military's execution of martial law, harboring doubts, with the primary concern being the necessity and legality of the military's execution of martial law. I would like to share some thoughts on this matter.

Firstly, was it necessary to deploy the military to execute martial law? Some people believe that the military's role is to consolidate national defense, resist aggression, and defend the motherland. Therefore, it was unnecessary for the military to enter Beijing and directly participate in executing martial law and maintaining social order. It should be pointed out that this understanding is incorrect. During the process of the military entering Beijing to execute martial law, a few bad elements were able to incite so many uninformed masses to block military vehicles and obstruct the advance of martial law troops, resulting in heartbreaking losses. This is related to some people's incorrect understanding of this issue.

Undoubtedly, resisting aggression and defending the motherland are important tasks for our military, which we usually refer to as the military's external functions. However, apart from external functions, does the military have internal functions? That is, when large-scale disturbances, riots, rebellions, or mutinies occur in society, does the military have the task of participating in suppressing the situation, cracking down on various criminal activities, and restoring and maintaining normal social order? I believe the answer should be affirmative. Firstly, theoretically, the military, as a core component of the state's dictatorship machinery, has always served to consolidate and maintain various social orders that are beneficial for the state's power to survive and operate. This is indisputable and has been eloquently discussed in Marxist state theory; secondly, from the practices of various sovereign countries around the world, whether capitalist or socialist, when a situation arises that seriously disrupts social order and hinders political rule, and other means cannot effectively stop and suppress it, military forces are usually used to control the situation. For example, the United States used regular troops to suppress the black movement in 172 cities in 1968; Britain used the military to intervene in strike movements 35 times after World War II; the Soviet Union has used the military multiple times since last year to strengthen control and maintain social order in areas like Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Uzbekistan; and Poland's use of the military for nationwide martial law to control the domestic situation in the early 1980s is still fresh in people's memory. Although the nature of the above examples varies, they all demonstrate the universality of the military's internal functions; thirdly, from the perspective of our military's mission, defending against external aggression and maintaining and strengthening people's democratic dictatorship, maintaining the normal order of social life, are all essential duties of serving the people wholeheartedly; fourthly, from the nature and facts of the current struggle, a few people created turmoil and launched a counter-revolutionary riot with the aim of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrowing the socialist system established by the Chinese people through long-term revolutionary struggles and the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, and subverting our People's Republic. This turmoil lasted nearly two months in the capital and spread to many large and medium-sized cities across the country. The public security forces and armed police could hardly control the situation using normal means. Faced with such a severe situation, if martial law had not been imposed in some areas of the capital and the military had not been deployed to execute martial law, the consequences would have been unimaginable. The above points fully demonstrate that the Party Central Committee's decision to deploy the military to execute martial law and swiftly suppress the counter-revolutionary riot was completely correct, timely, and beyond reproach.

Next, regarding the legality of the military's execution of martial law, it can be analyzed from two aspects: first, whether the military's execution of martial law has legal basis; second, whether the military has acted in accordance with the law during the execution of martial law. Below, I will introduce some relevant legal provisions and actual situations.

As a military legal worker, I would like to emphasize that the military's execution of martial law this time has legal basis. Firstly, the current Constitution of our country clearly states in the "Preamble" that the armed forces have the responsibility to maintain the dignity of the Constitution and ensure its implementation; Article 29 of the Constitution stipulates that the tasks of the armed forces of the People's Republic of China are to consolidate national defense, resist aggression, defend the motherland, defend the peaceful labor of the people, participate in national construction, and strive to serve the people. It can be seen that the Constitution not only stipulates the military's external functions but also the military's internal functions. Maintaining the dignity of the Constitution, ensuring the implementation of the Constitution, and defending the peaceful labor of the people are the military's internal functions, which of course include executing martial law when necessary; secondly, Article 89, Item 16 of our Constitution stipulates that the State Council has the power to decide on martial law in part of the provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government. Based on this provision, Premier Li Peng signed the order to impose martial law in part of Beijing on May 20. The above provisions of the Constitution and the martial law order signed by Premier Li Peng are the legal basis for the military's execution of martial law this time. In addition, I personally believe that the various notices issued by the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Martial Law Command during the martial law period actually belong to the category of special decrees and are also the legal basis for the martial law troops to execute their duties. Although our country's legislation on martial law is not yet perfect, for example, there is still a lack of a "Martial Law Law," which has brought some difficulties to the troops' execution of martial law, the above three aspects of provisions still constitute a relatively complete and sufficient legal basis for the military's execution of martial law this time. Those with a bit of legal knowledge can see this very clearly.

Did the military act in accordance with the law during the execution of martial law? This is a question of concern to the general public, especially to people from outside the capital. A few bad elements have spread many rumors on this issue, so it is particularly necessary to clarify the facts. In fact, strictly adhering to relevant laws and regulations and executing martial law in accordance with the law is a prominent feature of the military's execution of martial law this time. For example, why was there such a large number of casualties and equipment losses when the troops advanced into Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3? From a military perspective, this is almost unimaginable, and it can only be explained from the complexity of the situation at that time, the nature of our people's army, and the strict discipline. The deeds of martyrs like Liu Guoqing and Cui Guozheng are exemplary in strictly executing national laws, decrees, and policies. Again, the soldiers stationed in cultural relic protection areas such as Zhongshan Park strictly adhered to the provisions of the "Cultural Relics Protection Law" and did not damage a single cultural relic; after social order was basically restored to normal, the officers and soldiers, vehicles, etc. of the martial law troops strictly adhered to traffic management regulations when moving on Beijing's roads, with no or very few violations. In addition, the martial law troops assisted the public security organs in capturing criminals, which was also in accordance with legal provisions. Article 42 of our Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that any citizen can immediately hand over to the public security organs those who are in the act of committing a crime or are immediately discovered after committing a crime, those who are wanted, those who have escaped from prison, and those who are being pursued. If this can be done under normal circumstances, it is even more so during the extraordinary period of executing martial law. Therefore, the actions of the martial law troops' officers and soldiers are completely legal. Like the rest of the country, the entire army has carried out extensive legal education in recent years, and the legal awareness of the broad masses of officers and soldiers has been greatly enhanced. Since May 20, the martial law troops have further studied relevant legal knowledge according to the needs of their tasks, which has laid a solid foundation for using the law and handling various practical problems in accordance with the law during the execution of martial law. In the future, the main tasks of the martial law troops will be to assist and cooperate with the public security organs in deeply cracking down on a handful of counter-revolutionary rioters, guarding and protecting important targets, and stabilizing and consolidating the normal social order of the capital. To complete these tasks, the martial law troops will continue to study relevant laws and regulations and improve their ability and level of executing martial law in accordance with the law.

In summary, the military's execution of martial law in part of Beijing this time is not only necessary but also legal; not only legal but also exemplary and strictly executed the relevant legal provisions. Although a few people with ulterior motives have spread many lies on these issues, lies are after all lies. I believe that those who previously had doubts will, after understanding the relevant legal provisions and the true facts, give full understanding and support to the tasks executed by the martial law troops.

    军队执行戒严任务的必要性与合法性
    中央军委法制局局长　图们
    迅速平息6月初发生在北京的反革命暴乱的斗争，已经取得了决定性的胜利。现在，首都和全国的社会秩序已恢复正常。但据了解，当前仍有部分群众对于这次动用军队执行戒严任务的做法不够理解，思想上存在着一些疑惑，其中最主要的，就是军队执行戒严任务的必要性与合法性问题。下面，我想就此谈点看法。
    首先，这次动用军队执行戒严任务有无必要？一些群众认为，军队的任务是巩固国防，抵抗侵略，保卫祖国，因此，没有必要进驻北京，直接参与执行戒严任务，维护社会秩序。应该指出，这种认识是不正确的。在这次军队进驻北京执行戒严任务的过程中，极少数坏人能够煽动起那么多不明真相的群众去拦堵军车，阻止戒严部队开进，造成令人痛心的损失，就同部分群众对这个问题的认识不正确有关。
    毫无疑问，抵抗侵略，保卫祖国是我们军队的重要任务，通常我们将这个任务叫做军队的对外职能。但是，除了对外职能，军队还有没有对内的职能，即当社会上出现较大规模的骚乱、动乱、暴乱、叛乱事件时，军队有没有参与平息事态，镇压各种犯罪活动，恢复和维护正常社会秩序的任务呢？我认为，回答应该是肯定的。第一，从理论上讲，军队作为国家专政机器的核心组成部分，从来都要为巩固和维护有利于国家政权赖以生存和运转的各种社会秩序服务，这一点是毫无疑义的，这在马克思主义的国家学说中早有精辟论述；第二，从世界上各主权国家的实践看，不论是资本主义国家还是社会主义国家，当出现使社会秩序遭到严重破坏、政治统治受到严重妨碍，采用其他手段已不能有效地加以制止和平息的事态时，通常都使用军队来控制局势。例如美国在1968年动用正规军对172个城市的黑人运动进行镇压；英国在二次大战后有35次直接动用军队干预罢工运动；苏联自去年以来，对亚美尼亚、阿塞拜疆和乌兹别克等地的少数民族闹事，数次动用军队加强控制，维护社会秩序；至于波兰在80年代初期使用军队进行全国性的军事管制以控制国内政局的做法更是使人记忆犹新。尽管以上事例的性质各有不同，却表明了各国军队具有对内职能的普遍性；第三，从我国军队的宗旨看，对外抵御侵略，对内维护和加强人民民主专政，维持社会生活的正常秩序，都是全心全意为人民服务的题中应有之义，责无旁贷；第四，从当前这场斗争的性质和事实看，极少数人制造动乱，发动反革命暴乱，其目的就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻中国人民经过长期革命斗争、用无数革命先烈的生命和鲜血建立起来的社会主义制度，颠覆我们的人民共和国。这场动乱在首都历时近两个月，波及全国许多大中城市，武警和公安干警采用正常手段已经很难控制局面。面对这种十分严峻的形势，如果不在首都部分地区实行戒严，如果不动用军队执行戒严任务，其后果将不堪设想。以上充分说明，党中央这次动用军队执行戒严任务，一举平息反革命暴乱的决策是完全正确、十分及时、无可非议的。
    其次，关于军队执行戒严任务的合法性，可以从两个方面来加以分析：第一，军队执行戒严任务有没有法律依据？第二，军队在执行戒严任务的过程中有没有依法办事？下面我介绍一些有关的法律规定和实际情况。
    作为一名军队法律工作者，我想强调说明的是，这次军队执行戒严任务，是有法律依据的。首先，我国现行宪法在《序言》中明确指出：武装力量负有维护宪法尊严、保证宪法实施的职责；宪法第29条规定：中华人民共和国武装力量的任务是巩固国防、抵抗侵略，保卫祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动，参加国家建设事业，努力为人民服务。可见宪法既规定了军队的对外职能，也规定了军队的对内职能。维护宪法的尊严，保证宪法的实施，保卫人民的和平劳动，就是军队的对内职能，其中当然包括在必要时执行戒严任务；其次，我国宪法第89条第16项规定，国务院有权决定省、自治区、直辖市的范围内部分地区的戒严。根据这一规定，国务院总理李鹏5月20日签署了在北京市部分地区实行戒严的命令。宪法的上述规定和李鹏总理签署的戒严令，就是这次军队执行戒严任务的法律依据。此外，我个人认为，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部在戒严期间所发布的各项通告，实际上属于特别法令的范畴，也是戒严部队执行任务的法律依据。尽管由于我国在戒严方面的立法还不够健全，比如还缺少一部《戒严法》，这给部队执行戒严任务带来了一定困难，但以上三个方面的规定还是构成了这次军队执行戒严任务的比较完整而充分的法律依据，对此，稍有法律常识的人都能看得很清楚。
    军队在这次执行戒严任务的过程中有没有依法办事？这是广大群众、尤其是外地群众普遍关心的问题。极少数坏人在这个问题上制造了很多谣言，因此特别需要加以澄清。实际上，模范地遵守有关法律法规，严格依法戒严，是这次军队执行戒严任务的一个突出特点。例如6月3日晚部队向天安门广场开进时为什么会有那么大的人员伤亡和装备损失？这从军事角度看几乎是不可思议的，对此，只能从当时情况的复杂性、我们人民军队的性质和法纪的严明来加以解释。刘国庚、崔国政等烈士的事迹堪称严格执行国家法律、法令和政策的典范。再如，驻扎在中山公园等文物保护区域内的部队指战员严格遵守了《文物保护法》的规定，没有损坏一件文物；社会秩序基本恢复正常以后，戒严部队的官兵、车辆等在北京道路上行进时，严格遵守了公路交通管理方面的法规制度，没有或极少有违反的情况。此外，戒严部队协助公安机关抓捕人犯，也是在执行法律的规定。我国刑事诉讼法第42条规定，对于正在实行犯罪或者在犯罪后即时被发觉的、通缉在案的、越狱逃跑的、正在被追捕的人犯，任何公民都可以立即扭送公安机关。在正常情况下尚可如此，更何况在执行戒严任务的非常时期。所以，戒严部队官兵的这一行动是完全合法的。与全国一样，近几年全军广泛开展了普法教育，广大官兵的法律意识得到大大加强，今年5月20日以来，戒严部队根据任务的需要，又进一步学习了有关法律知识，这就为在执行戒严任务的过程中运用法律，依照法律处理各种实际问题奠定了坚实的基础。今后，戒严部队的主要任务是协助、配合公安机关深入打击一小撮反革命暴乱分子，警戒保卫重要目标，稳定和巩固首都的正常社会秩序。为了完成这些任务，戒严部队仍在继续学习有关法律法规，提高依法戒严的能力和水平。
    总之，军队这次在北京部分地区执行戒严任务不仅是必要的，而且是合法的；不仅是合法的，而且模范地、严格地执行了有关法律的规定。尽管极少数别有用心的人在这些问题上制造了不少谎言，但谎言终归是谎言，相信原先存有疑虑的部分群众在了解有关法律规定和事实真相后，会对戒严部队执行的任务给予充分理解和支持。
