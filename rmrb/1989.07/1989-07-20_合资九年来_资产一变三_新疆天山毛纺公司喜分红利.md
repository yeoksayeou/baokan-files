One of China's top ten best joint ventures, the Xinjiang Tianshan Wool Textile Company, recently had a joyous occasion: shareholders from Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and Japan gathered in Urumqi to share the largest dividend in the nine years since the factory was established. The foreign shareholders' assets have tripled over the nine years, with one-third taken as dividends and two-thirds reinvested in the company to generate more profits.

The Tianshan Wool Textile Company is a modern enterprise that produces high-end cashmere and wool sweaters for export. Last year, the company achieved its highest profit since its establishment, reaching 42.39 million yuan, with a capital return rate of 38.3%. Such high returns not only place the company among the top in domestic enterprises but also rank it highly among its counterparts in Japan and Hong Kong. Over the nine years since its establishment, the company has been profitable every year except for the first year of operation. According to the joint venture agreement, the profits from the first three years of operation, totaling 2.7 million US dollars, were not distributed as dividends but were entirely reinvested in the company as development funds. Starting from 1985, the company has distributed dividends four times. In addition to continuing to reinvest the dividends received three times as capital, the cash dividends taken out are equivalent to the initial capital invested by each party. Now, the fixed capital and working capital owned by each shareholder in the company have both exceeded the initial investment by nearly three times.

    合资九年来　资产一变三
    新疆天山毛纺公司喜分红利
    本报乌鲁木齐7月20日电  记者曾坤报道：中国十大最佳合资企业之一的新疆天山毛纺织品有限公司，近日喜气洋洋：新疆、香港、日本三家合资方的股东们聚集乌鲁木齐，分享建厂9年来最大的一次红利。外方股东的资产，在9年里一变三，一份作为红利提走，两份作为资产留在企业再创利润。
    天山毛纺织品有限公司是生产出口高档山羊绒羊毛衫的现代化企业。去年，这个公司获利创开业9年来的最高水平，达到4239万元，资本总额利润率高达38.3％，如此高的效益，不仅居国内企业中的一流水平，在日本、香港的同行业中，亦居上乘。这个公司建立9年来，除第一年亏损外，8年来年年盈利。按合资合同规定，盈利前三年所盈利润270万美元不分红，全部作为生产发展基金投入企业。从1985年开始分红，至今已是第四次，各方除继续将分得的红利作为资本3次增加投资外，拿走的红利（现金）就相当于各方投资的初始资本，而如今属于各股东的企业固定资本、流动资金总额均超过最初投资近3倍。
