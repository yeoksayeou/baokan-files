Hunan Tonglian Company and CITIC Violated State Orders for Illegal Export of Electrolytic Nickel Seized by Tianjin Customs

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 12th — (Correspondent Huang Zhen, Reporter Mengzi Jun) Hunan Provincial Import and Export Company Tonglian Company, in collusion with China International Trust and Investment Corporation, recently illegally exported 100 tons of electrolytic nickel, a commodity strictly prohibited by the state, valued at 1.26 million US dollars. The shipment was seized and detained by Tianjin Customs. Currently, Tianjin Customs and relevant departments are further investigating and handling this case.

According to Tianjin Customs, Hunan Provincial Import and Export Company Tonglian Company imported 100 tons of electrolytic nickel in December 1988. After the goods were imported, the domestic price of electrolytic nickel was strictly controlled. Seeing no profit to be made, Tonglian Company used the excuse that the goods "did not meet the requirements" to request a refund. Later, CITIC Group's Xingye Company and CITIC Group's Short Base Company in Hong Kong reached an agreement to refund the goods in the form of a "contract." In February, they declared to customs that the goods were to be "returned." The provided quality analysis certificate was merely a letter from the Eastern Non-Ferrous Metals Technology Consulting Company, not the commercial inspection certificate issued by the contract-specified commodity inspection agency, and thus lacked any legal certification.

    湖南通联公司和中信公司违反国家禁令
    非法出口电解镍被天津海关查获
    据新华社天津7月12日电　（通讯员黄臻、记者孟子君）湖南省进出口公司通联公司伙同中国国际信托投资公司不久前非法出口国家严格禁止出口的电解镍100吨，价值126万美元，被天津海关查获并扣压。目前，天津海关与有关部门正在进一步调查处理此案。
    据天津海关介绍，湖南省进出口公司通联公司于1988年12月进口电解镍100吨。货物进口后，国内对电解镍已实行限价。通联公司看到无利可图，遂以货物“不符合要求”为由要求退货。后由中信集团兴业公司与中信集团在香港的肖特基公司以“协议书”形式达成退货“协议”，于2月份申报海关“退运”。提供的品质分析证明只是东方有色金属科技咨询公司的一纸便函，而不是合同规定的商品检验机关出具的商检证，根本不具备公证效力。
