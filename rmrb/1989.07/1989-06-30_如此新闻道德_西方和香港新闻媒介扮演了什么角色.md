Title: Such Journalistic Ethics: The Role of Western and Hong Kong Media

Western and Hong Kong media outlets have always claimed to be objective and fair, but in their coverage of the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, they violated journalistic ethics, spreading a large amount of rumors, and played an unseemly role.

The day after the suppression of the riot—June 5th, the front page of Hong Kong's *Ming Pao* newspaper featured the headline: "Li Peng Shot!" It claimed that Li Peng was shot by an officer in the Great Hall of the People; the second piece of news was that the martial law troops were fighting among themselves, claiming that the 27th Army was surrounded and engaged in battle by the 38th Army and other units; the third piece of news was "Deng Xiaoping is dead." On June 6th, the front page of Hong Kong's *Oriental Daily News* again published the news that "Li Peng fled to Inner Mongolia."

The rumors were refuted on their own! Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Li Peng appeared on the television screen. The disciplined martial law troops were clearing away obstacles and garbage on the streets. PLA soldiers helped suburban farmers harvest wheat, and military vehicles were busy transporting grain and vegetables for the citizens.

Rumors continued to spread! Massacre at Tiananmen Square! Bloody massacre in Beijing! Machine guns mowed down unarmed students and citizens, killing tens of thousands! Tanks crushed students in their tents into meat patties! Bodies were burned at Tiananmen Square, and helicopters were used to transport them away...

Shocking headlines appeared daily in newspapers and on television. Television stations broadcast "special news" day and night, every few dozen minutes, and even aired specials titled "The City's Massacre" and "The Dragon's Roar." The announcers screamed as if China were in complete darkness and Beijing had become a living hell!

The information came from *Voice of America* and Western news agencies, from foreign and Hong Kong reporters in Beijing, from "witnesses" and phone interviews.

A Hong Kong television reporter interviewed a "witness," who spread the rumor that thousands or tens of thousands had died. His face quickly appeared on Hong Kong television, and the rumor spread to every household. Later, CCTV rebroadcasted this scene, exposing the rumor-monger. The next day, the man was tried in the Dalian Public Security Bureau, admitting to his lies and crimes. Hong Kong television rebroadcasted this scene but cut out the part where the rumor-monger confessed, with the obvious intention: China has no freedom of speech; they spread those rumors again. A two-in-one move!

Based on hearsay and subjective speculation, reporters made one-sided, exaggerated, and distorted reports, releasing shocking news. On television, they accompanied the news with gunfire, flames, tanks, military vehicles, and fleeing crowds. But as evidence of the "Tiananmen Massacre" and "Bloody Suppression of Pro-Democracy Activists," there were only a few scenes: a woman holding a child, reportedly hit by seven bullets; a hospital displaying several corpses; a crowd pushing an injured person on a bench into the hospital; an injured person lying on a flatbed tricycle, with a few people helping to push it; another tricycle carrying an injured person rushing down the street. These were the "massacre" evidence that Western reporters could find in thousands of feet of film! These scenes were repeatedly shown dozens of times on Hong Kong television over a week.

The most important witness should be Miss Cai Ping. This student from Beijing Normal University was a disciple of Fang Lizhi and his wife, the leader of the "High Autonomous Federation," and the commander of Tiananmen Square. She commanded the demonstrations and hunger strikes from start to finish, inciting the riot. After the riot failed, she hid in a dark corner, recorded a tape, and secretly sent it to Hong Kong to be broadcast on Jade Channel. Cai Ping, using literary language, narrated the process of withdrawing from Tiananmen Square as if she were performing, aiming to accuse the PLA of "atrocities." But she only mentioned that the loudspeakers on the square were riddled with bullets and that a student was kicked by the PLA, without a word about casualties on the square. If there was a "Tiananmen Massacre" as Western and Hong Kong media outlets claimed, with tanks crushing students on the square and machine guns mowing down students, this woman who hated the government would be the most authoritative witness. Could she hide the truth? Cai Ping also mentioned that many people died and were injured elsewhere, but she used the word "heard." Was it Cai Ping who told the truth, or was it the Western and Hong Kong media outlets that spread lies? Anyone with eyes can see. Cai Ping and thousands of students walked from Tiananmen to Beijing University, covering tens of kilometers, and there were no casualties along the way. Could this prove the bloody suppression of pro-democracy students?

On the Hong Kong television screen, a man blocked a column of tanks. The leading tank dodged left and right, but the man still blocked it from the left and right. Finally, the tank stopped, and the man climbed onto the tank. If the PLA was as brutal as you said, this provocateur, whom you called a "hero," would have been torn to pieces long ago! This also exposed the lie of tanks crushing students into meat patties!

The screen also showed rioters climbing onto armored vehicles, smashing the car tops with iron tools, setting fire to the soldiers inside; it also showed rioters seizing weapons, taking military vehicles, throwing Molotov cocktails, throwing bricks and stones, insulting, attacking, and kidnapping PLA soldiers. But the announcer remained silent, truly "silence is golden."

Hundreds of military vehicles were burned, and all had armed soldiers inside. Why did they just watch as the rioters rampaged? It was because they feared injuring students and citizens among the crowd. The rioters took the PLA's restraint for weakness and took advantage of it, pushing over a military vehicle on Cuiming Road and burning the six PLA soldiers inside to cinders. These media outlets even spread the rumor that the military vehicles were burned by the PLA themselves, while others said that the martial law troops opened fire first, and the angry crowd set the vehicles on fire. This was turning black into white! If the PLA had not followed the orders of "not hitting back when hit" and "not retali

    如此新闻道德
    ——西方和香港新闻媒介扮演了什么角色
    蓝默
    西方和香港的传播媒介，向来标榜客观公正，但在报道北京平息反革命暴乱中，却违背新闻道德，散布大量谣言，扮演了不光彩的角色。
    平息暴乱的第二天——6月5日，香港《明报》头版头条的大标题是“李鹏中枪”！说李鹏在人民大会堂，被一军官开枪击中；二条新闻是戒严部队发生内战，说27军被38军等部队包围激战；三条消息是“邓小平死亡”。6月6日，香港《东方日报》头版，又刊登了“李鹏逃往内蒙”的消息。
    谣言不攻自破！邓小平和李鹏同志在电视屏幕上露面了。纪律严明的戒严部队，在街头清除路障和垃圾。解放军战士帮助郊区农民收割小麦，军车忙着为市民运粮运菜。
    谣言依然满天飞！血洗天安门广场！北京血腥大屠杀！机枪扫射手无寸铁的学生和市民，打死成千上万！坦克将帐篷中的学生压成肉饼！天安门广场焚尸，用直升飞机运走……
    骇人听闻的大标题，天天在报纸和电视上出现。电视台日以继夜播映“特别新闻”，几十分钟一次，还用“屠城”和“龙的怒吼”放了专辑，播音员嘶声叫喊，仿佛中国一片漆黑，北京成了人间地狱！
    消息来自《美国之音》和西方通讯社，来自北京的外国和香港记者，来自“目击者”和电话访问。
    香港电视记者访问一个“目击者”，那家伙造谣说死了几千几万，他的尊容很快在香港电视上出现，谣言传遍千家万户。后来中央电视台转播这一镜头，将造谣者示众。第二天，那家伙在大连公安局受审，承认胡说八道犯了罪。香港电视台重映这组镜头，却删去造谣者悔罪的话音，用意很明显：中国没有言论自由；再次散布那些谣言。一箭双雕！
    根据道听途说和主观猜测，作了片面夸张歪曲的报道，记者先生们发布一条条震撼人心的新闻。电视上配以枪声火光、坦克军车和群众逃跑等画面。但作为“血洗天安门”、“血腥镇压民运人士”的有力证据，只有这样几个镜头：一个妇女抱着一个儿童，据说她身中七枪；医院里陈列数具尸体；群众将长椅上一个伤者推进医院；平板三轮车上躺着一个伤者，几个人帮着推行；另一辆三轮车载着一个伤者在马路上奔跑。这是西方记者拍摄的几千尺胶片中，能拿出的“大屠杀”证据！这些镜头在一周的香港电视上，反反复复出现了数十次。
    最重要的目击者应是柴玲小姐了。这位北师大的学生，是方励之夫妇的高徒、“高自联”的头目、天安门广场的总指挥。她自始至终在天安门指挥示威、绝食，挑动暴乱。暴乱失败后，她躲在阴暗的角落，录制一盘录音带，秘密送到香港，在翡翠台上播映。柴玲以文学语言，如演如诉地叙述撤出天安门广场的经过，旨在控诉解放军“暴行”。但她只说广场喇叭被打成蜂窝，有个学生被解放军踢了一脚，并无一言提到广场上有人伤亡。如果有像西方和香港新闻媒介叫嚣的“血洗天安门”，有坦克压死广场上的学生，有机枪扫射学生，这位仇恨人民政府的女人，是最权威的证人，她能隐而不宣吗？柴玲也说别处死了多少、伤了若干，但都用“听说”这个词儿。究竟是柴玲说了实话，还是西方和香港新闻媒介造了谎言？明眼人一看便知。柴玲和数千学生从天安门到北京大学，走了十几公里，途中竟无一伤亡，这能证明血腥镇压民运学生吗？
    香港电视屏幕上，映出一男人拦阻一队坦克车，为首的坦克左躲右闪，那人还是左拦右堵，最后坦克停车，让那人爬上车顶。如果解放军像你们所说的那样残暴，这个被你们称为“英雄”的挑衅者，早该粉身碎骨了！这也揭穿坦克将学生压成肉饼的弥天大谎！
    屏幕上也映出暴徒们爬上装甲车，用铁器猛砸车盖，放火烧死车中的解放军；还映出暴徒们抢武器，夺军车，掷汽油瓶子，扔砖头石块，辱骂、围攻、绑架解放军，但播音员却缄口不言，真是“此时无声胜有声”。
    数百辆军车被焚毁，车上都有持枪的战士，为何瞪眼瞧暴徒横行？只因怕误伤群众中的学生和市民。暴徒们把解放军的克制当成软弱可欺，肆无忌惮地在翠微路推翻一辆军车，将车中的6名解放军烧成焦炭。这些新闻媒介竟造谣说军车是解放军自己烧的，有的则说是戒严部队先开枪，愤怒的人群才放火烧车。真是颠倒黑白！假如解放军不是执行“打不还手、骂不还口”的命令，部队不会伤亡那么大！假如不是怕误伤好人，强行开车入城，任何暴徒也挡不住，军车不会被烧毁那么多！这是简单的常识。
    解放军战士都是有理想有血性的青年，在忍无可忍、退无可退之际，为了不让天安门被玷污，为了捍卫千百万先烈用鲜血建立的共和国，坚决执行戒严的神圣任务，向进攻的暴徒还击，扫清前进道路，这是天经地义之事，不可避免有人伤亡，这就是“血腥大屠杀”的真相。
    北京中央电视台播放了平息反革命暴乱的真相。西方和香港新闻媒体是看到收到，有些片段已被转播。但对那些解放军被惨杀的场面，却装作看不见！那在崇文门天桥被暴徒打伤、又被从高空扔下烧死的崔国政，那被烧死又被破肚拉肠的刘国庚，那在翠微路被烧焦的6位战士……这些被你们称为民运人士惨无人道的暴行，难道不是客观事实吗？标榜客观公正的大人先生们，怎么不报道不转播？为什么怕世人知道这些真相呢？
    在西方和香港一些传播媒介造谣煽动下，香港和国外演出一场场反对中国政府、反对中共和解放军的闹剧，蒙骗了千万善良的人。
    谣言终归是谣言，说了多少遍也不会变成真理。事实永远是事实，总有一天会大白于天下。善良的人们！请擦亮眼睛，多动动脑筋，冷静地想一想吧！
