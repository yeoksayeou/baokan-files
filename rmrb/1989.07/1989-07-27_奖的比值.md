The Ratio of Prizes

A massive eight-volume work titled "A General History of Chinese Art," totaling 2.5 million characters, was written by seventeen experts in art history from various national art academies, research institutes, and museums. This work won the National Excellent Book Award last year. Each author received a prize of fifty 8-fen (0.08 yuan) stamps. In contrast, the winners of a certain beverage advertisement slogan contest each received a prize of 5,000 yuan. One of the winning slogans was "×××, endlessly drinkable, with a lingering aftertaste." This slogan, including punctuation, has only thirteen characters. Another winning slogan was also less than twenty characters.

The disparity in prize money is astonishing!

Of course, the beverage company is well-managed and financially robust. Even if the prize money were doubled, no one would complain. After all, this is a form of competition. As for the authors of "A General History of Chinese Art," I believe they should be content and confident. After all, they have published a book and won an award. Compared to those who have poured their hearts into writing manuscripts but cannot get them published because publishers cannot make money, and have to go around bowing and scraping, isn't this fortunate enough?

However, if a large number of people draw conclusions from these two vastly different prize amounts and rush to change careers, won't the evening television advertisement programs become even more numerous?

    奖的比值
    由全国各艺术院校、研究所、博物馆的十七位美术史研究专家撰写的二百五十万字的八卷巨著《中国美术通史》，去年获全国优秀图书奖。每位作者得到的奖金是五十枚八分钱的邮票。而某饮料广告词征集评选结果，两位采用奖获得者每位获得的奖金是五千元。其中一条写的是“×××百饮不厌，回味无穷。”连标点一共十三个字。另一条也不到二十字。
    同是奖金，悬殊之巨，令人乍舌！
    当然，饮料集团有限公司经营有方，财大气粗，即使奖金再增加一倍，别人也不会说
  “葡萄酸”。何况这样做本身也是一种竞争。而《中国美术通史》的作者们我相信也该自足自信，毕竟出了书，还得了奖。比起那些呕心沥血写成了书稿，却因出版社赚不到钱而不肯出书，不得不四处打躬作揖的作家、学者们来，不是够幸运的吗？
    不过倘若又有一大批人士从上述两项不等的奖金中嗅出了点什么，争着改行转业，那每天晚上电视广告节目，不是会更多得不得了吗？
