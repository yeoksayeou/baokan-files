    Acid Rain Severely Corrodes the Earth
    Dong Ming

        ①Soviet Union
    West of the Ural Mountains, a large amount of sulfur oxides are emitted. Combined with pollutants from Eastern European countries carried by the wind, 300,000 hectares of forests are affected, with coniferous trees and oaks being the most severely impacted. Lakes in areas like the Kola Peninsula have become acidic, threatening agricultural production.

        ②Sweden
    Out of the country's 80,000-plus lakes and marshes, 18,000 have acidic water, leading to fish deaths. Acid rain seeping into the ground threatens underground water supplies, with the acidity levels of wells supplying water to 2 million people exceeding standards.

        ③Norway
    Due to the influence of south winds from Europe's industrial regions, on average, one out of every four trees is withering or growing poorly. After last summer, "red tides" were discovered along the coast, which are believed to be related to acid rain.

        ④Poland
    The use of large amounts of low-grade brown coal has severely polluted water bodies and air. Acid rain falls across the entire country, with forests in the southwestern mountainous regions showing signs of dying. Research institutions have issued warnings that if pollution continues at this rate, the country's forests will be destroyed by the end of the century.

        ⑤United Kingdom
    Famous ancient buildings are being corroded by acid rain. The House of Commons' Environment Committee reported on the damage to Westminster Abbey. The stone of St. Paul's Cathedral has been eroded by 3 centimeters, with 2 centimeters of that occurring in the last 50 years.

        ⑥France
    The range of corrosion is expanding, with forests being the second most affected in Europe, with 28% of the trees harmed. In mountainous regions near West Germany and the Jura Mountains in the south, about 11% of the trees are withering.

        ⑦West Germany
    Acid rain is referred to as the "green plague." Under the impact of acid rain, the area of forests affected increased from 7.7% in 1982 to 52% in 1987. The famous "Black Forest" in the south has 75% of its area affected to varying degrees.

        ⑧Switzerland
    About 56% of the forests in the Alps are affected by acid rain. Trees on cliffs not only have damaged branches and leaves but also roots, becoming a significant cause of landslides and avalanches.

        ⑨Greece
    Due to the influence of acid rain, ancient sites like the Parthenon in Athens are being corroded. The marble used, being calcium carbonate, easily dissolves in acid rain, causing sculptures and statues to peel off and become indistinct.

    ⑩Canada-U.S. Border Region
    In eastern Canada, over 100,000 lakes and marshes have become acidic, resulting in deformed fish. In 14,000 lakes, fish struggle to survive. In Quebec, Canada, and Troy, USA, dead trees are commonly seen.

      ?United States East
    Red tides have appeared near the mouth of the Potomac River in the Chesapeake Bay outside Washington, D.C., and it has been confirmed that acid rain is related. 25% of the nitrogen oxides that cause red tides come from acid rain. The acidity of the sea is increasing, threatening the survival of some fish species.

      ?United States West
    Acid rain areas have expanded beyond the Rocky Mountains to the west coast. In the spring, the melting of acidic snow flows into rivers and lakes, causing water acidification. In many places, the acidity level is below PH 5 (a PH value below 5.6 is considered acid rain, and the lower the PH value, the stronger the acidity).

      ?Venezuela
    In the Orinoco River basin and the headwaters of the Amazon, 3/4 of the forest soil has become acidic. Since 1970, the amount of nitrogen oxides has doubled, and sulfur dioxide has increased by twofold, seriously affecting the natural ecosystem.

        ?Japan
    The Environmental Agency has been conducting tests in seven regions nationwide since 1983, with an average acidity level of PH 4.4. In areas with less pollution, acidity levels also increase during the winter.

        ?China
    China is the world's second-largest coal producer, emitting a large amount of sulfur dioxide. In places like Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guizhou, the harm from acid rain is becoming increasingly severe. 40% of the trees on Mount Emei have died.

      ?Malaysia
    Air pollution is severe in the capital Kuala Lumpur, and acid rain corrosion is also developing. Recently, the acidity level in the suburbs has been measured at PH 4.4-4.8.

        ?India
    Acid rain has caused the marble walls of the famous Taj Mahal to peel. The presence of nearby refineries and power plants emitting harmful gases is said to be a significant cause of the peeling of ancient buildings.

      ?Nigeria
    Local farmers often burn fields to clear land, releasing large amounts of nitrogen oxides in the smoke, leading to soil acidification. Pollution from burning oil and refining processes accelerates soil acidification, directly affecting crop yields.

    酸雨严重腐蚀地球
    冬明
        ①苏联
    乌拉尔山脉以西，硫氧化物大量排出，加之东欧国家的污染物凭借风力聚集，30万公顷森林受害，针叶林、橡树受害为最。科拉半岛等地的湖水酸化，危及农业生产。
        ②瑞典
    全国8万多湖泊、沼泽中，有1.8万处水质酸化，鱼类死亡。酸雨渗进地里，危及地下水，供200万居民使用的井水的酸性值超出标准。
        ③挪威
    由于欧洲工业地带的南风的影响，平均4棵树木中有1棵枯萎或生长不良。去年夏季后，沿海发现“红潮”，据分析与酸雨有关。
        ④波兰
    由于使用大量低品位褐煤，水体及空气遭到严重污染。降酸雨区域涉及全国，西南部山区的森林已出现枯死。研究机构发出警告：如此污染下去，国内森林到本世纪末将遭毁灭。
        ⑤英国
    著名古建筑受到酸雨腐蚀。下院环境委员会报告了威斯敏斯特教堂的受害情况。圣·保罗大教堂的石料被蚀3厘米，其中2厘米以上是在最近50年中出现的。
        ⑥法国
    腐蚀范围不断扩大，森林受害面积居欧洲第2位，28％的林木遭殃。靠近西德的山区及南部汝拉山区约有11％的林木枯萎。
        ⑦西德
    人称酸雨是“绿色的鼠疫”。在酸雨的冲击下，森林受害面积由1982年的7.7％猛增到1987年的52％。西德人引为自豪的南部“黑林”，75％受到不同程度危害。
        ⑧瑞士
    阿尔卑斯山区约56％的森林受酸雨之害。悬崖峭壁上的林木不仅枝叶而且根部也受伤，成为导致塌方和雪崩的重要原因。
        ⑨希腊
    受酸雨影响，雅典的巴特农神庙等古代遗迹遭到腐蚀。由于所用大理石属碳酸钙，遇酸雨易溶解，致使浮雕、神像剥落，模糊不清。
    ⑩加美边境地区
    加拿大东部有10万多个湖泊、沼泽酸化，出现了畸型鱼。1.4万处湖泊中的鱼类难以生存。美国的东北部也有上千的湖泊、沼泽酸化。在加拿大魁北克省、美国的特洛伊等地，常见枯木。
      ?美国东部
    华盛顿郊外波托马克河口附近的切萨比克海湾出现的红潮，已查明与酸雨有关，引发红潮的氮氧化物的25％来自酸雨。海域的酸度增加，一些鱼种面临死亡威胁。
      ?美国西部
    降酸雨地区越过洛基山脉扩大到西海岸。春季，酸性雪溶化，流入河流、湖泊，导致水质酸化。许多地方的酸度达PH5以下（PH值小于5.6即为酸雨，PH值越小，酸性越强）。
      ?委内瑞拉
    在奥里诺科河流域和亚马孙河源头，3／4的森林土壤已酸化。1970年以后，这里的氮氧化物倍增，二氧化硫增加2倍，严重影响自然生态。
        ?日本
    环境厅从1983年起在全国7个地区测试，酸度平均达PH4.4，局部地区农作物受害。在排出污染物质较少的地区，每到冬季酸度也增加。
        ?中国
    煤炭产量居世界第二位，有大量二氧化硫气体排出。四川重庆、贵州等地，受酸雨之害日趋严重。峨眉山上的丛树林有40％枯死。
      ?马来西亚
    首都吉隆坡大气污染严重，酸雨腐蚀也在发展。最近测出郊区酸性值达PH4.4—4.8。
        ?印度
    酸雨致使著名的泰姬陵的大理石墙出现剥落现象。建筑物附近建有炼油厂、火力电厂，排出有害气体，据称是造成古建筑物剥落的一个重要原因。
      ?尼日利亚
    当地农民习惯于烧荒开垦土地，浓烟中大量的氮氧化物导致土壤酸化。燃烧石油和炼油过程中出现污染，加速土壤酸化，直接影响农作物的产量。世界酸雨分布示意图。（附图片）
