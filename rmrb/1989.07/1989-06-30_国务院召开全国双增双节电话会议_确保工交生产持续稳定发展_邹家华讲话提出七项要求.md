The State Council held a national teleconference on increasing production and saving resources, as well as increasing revenue and reducing expenditures, this afternoon. The conference aimed to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party. It called on the broad masses of cadres and workers in the industrial and transportation sectors to resolutely implement the Party Central Committee and the State Council's policies on rectification and deepening reforms. At this critical juncture, which concerns the future and destiny of the Party and the country, the conference urged everyone to unite closely around the Party Central Committee, further broaden and deepen the double increase and double reduction movement, and make new achievements in improving economic efficiency and ensuring the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

State Councilor Zhou Jiahua delivered a speech at the meeting. Representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Energy, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the Anshan Iron and Steel Company also spoke.

Zhou Jiahua said that further broadening and deepening the double increase and double reduction movement is an important task for implementing the requirements of the Fourth Plenary Session's communiqué.

After detailing the good results of national industrial and transportation production in the first five months of this year, he said that despite the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing and disturbances in other cities, the broad masses of cadres and workers overcame difficulties, maintained production, and met the needs of the economy and people's lives. This demonstrated the high political awareness and sense of responsibility of the working class. The facts have proven that the Chinese working class has passed the test in this serious political struggle, truly deserving to be the masters of the socialist motherland and the main force for developing productive forces and maintaining stability and unity. He, on behalf of the State Council and Premier Li Peng, expressed heartfelt thanks and the highest respect to all cadres and workers in the industrial and transportation sectors.

Zhou Jiahua pointed out in his speech that to fully complete the annual production tasks, we must be soberly aware of the existing problems and difficulties. The main issues are the prominent structural contradictions in industry. The growth of state-owned industry is slow, and large and medium-sized key enterprises face greater difficulties, while collective industry, especially township and village enterprises, continue to grow at an excessively high rate. Basic industries such as energy, transportation, and raw materials remain weak, while general processing industries continue to expand. According to industrial policies, enterprises with low efficiency, high consumption, and products that are sluggish or even long-term losing money have not been effectively shut down or restructured. The contradictions of tight transportation and energy supplies are further expanding, with railway transportation and coastal shipping capacity becoming increasingly insufficient. The problems of enterprise funding shortages and raw material shortages have not been well resolved, continuing to constrain current production and market supply. The situation of mutual arrears and fund squeezes between enterprises, between enterprises and banks, and between banks is quite serious. The improvement in industrial economic efficiency is small, and some have even declined.

He stressed that now, the suppression of disturbances and the counter-revolutionary riots have achieved decisive victories, and the situation is gradually returning to normal. However, a small number of reactionaries are not willing to admit defeat and are still looking for opportunities to take revenge and plot to sabotage our industrial and transportation production. Internationally, some countries and organizations have launched anti-China waves, using various means to interfere in China's internal affairs and exert pressure on us. The broad masses of cadres and workers must respond to the Party's call, take immediate action, hold their posts, and do a good job in production to stabilize the economy and ensure supply. United in heart and mind, we must make up for the losses caused by the disturbances and ensure the full and over-fulfillment of this year's production and construction tasks, ensuring the sustained and stable development of industrial and transportation production and continuing to push forward the cause of reform and opening up.

For the second half of the year's double increase and double reduction movement, Zhou Jiahua proposed seven requirements:

- Strive to adjust the product structure, increase the production of marketable products, ensure effective supply, and expand exports to earn foreign exchange.
- Focus on energy conservation and emission reduction as the key, achieve increased production through savings, and alleviate the shortage of energy and raw materials.
- Strengthen the work of turning losses into profits, enhance the ability to digest, and improve economic efficiency.
- Strengthen financial management, accelerate the turnover of funds, and alleviate financial difficulties.
- Focus on improving product quality and technological progress.
- Strengthen enterprise management, tap the potential of equipment, ensure safe production, and seek benefits from management.
- Strive for hard work, frugality, and strictly reduce various non-production expenditures.

    国务院召开全国双增双节电话会议
    确保工交生产持续稳定发展
    邹家华讲话提出七项要求
    本报北京6月30日讯　记者鲁牧报道：国务院今天下午召开全国增产节约、增收节支电话会议，认真贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，号召全国工交战线广大干部和职工坚决贯彻执行党中央、国务院关于治理整顿和深化改革的方针，在当前关系到党和国家前途和命运的紧要关头，紧密团结在党中央周围，进一步广泛、深入地开展双增双节运动，为提高经济效益、保证国民经济持续稳定协调发展作出新的成绩。
    国务委员邹家华在会上作了讲话。财政部、能源部、上海市和广东省人民政府，以及鞍山钢铁公司的负责人在会上发了言。
    邹家华说，进一步广泛、深入地开展双增双节运动，是当前落实四中全会公报要求的一项重要任务。
    他在详细通报今年头5个月全国工交生产的较好成绩之后说，在北京发生反革命暴乱和其它一些城市发生动乱的情况下，广大干部和职工克服困难，坚持生产，满足了社会经济和人民生活的需要，表现出工人阶级的高度政治觉悟和责任心。事实证明，我国工人阶级在这场严重的政治斗争中经受住了考验，不愧为社会主义祖国的主人翁，不愧为发展生产力的主力军、维护安定团结的主力军。他代表国务院和李鹏总理，向全国工交战线各级干部和全体职工致以衷心感谢和崇高敬意。
    邹家华在讲话中指出，为了全面完成全年生产任务，应当清醒地看到目前存在的问题和困难。主要是工业结构性矛盾突出。全民所有制工业增长较慢，大中型骨干企业面临困难更大，而集体工业特别是乡办工业增长速度仍然过高。能源、交通运输、原材料等基础工业依然薄弱，而一般性加工工业继续膨胀。按产业政策要求，效益低、消耗高、产品滞销甚至长期亏损的企业，还未得以有效的关停并转。交通、能源紧张制约经济的矛盾在进一步扩大，铁路运输、沿海船舶运力不足愈来愈突出。企业资金短缺、原材料不足问题至今未能很好解决，继续制约着当前生产和市场供应。企业与企业、企业与银行、银行与银行之间，相互拖欠款项、挤压资金状况相当严重。工业经济效益提高幅度小，有的还下降。
    他强调说，现在，制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱已经取得了决定性胜利，局势逐步恢复正常。但是，极少数反动分子决不甘心失败，还在窥测方向，伺机报复，阴谋破坏我工业交通生产；国际上一些国家和组织掀起反华浪潮，以种种手段粗暴干涉中国内政，向我施加压力。广大干部和职工一定要响应党的号召，立即行动起来，坚守岗位，搞好生产，稳定经济，保障供给；同心同德，夺回动乱造成的损失，保证全面超额完成今年生产建设任务，确保工交生产持续稳定，并将改革开放事业继续推向前进。
    对下半年双增双节运动，邹家华提出了7项要求：
    ——努力调整产品结构，增产适销对路产品，保障有效供给，扩大出口创汇；
    ——突出以节能降耗为重点，以节约求增产，缓解能源、原材料短缺矛盾；
    ——狠抓扭亏增盈工作，增强消化能力，提高经济效益；
    ——强化资金管理，加速资金周转，缓解资金困难；
    ——狠抓提高产品质量和技术进步工作；
    ——加强企业管理，挖掘设备潜力，抓好安全生产，向管理要效益；
    ——艰苦奋斗，勤俭节约，坚决压缩各种非生产性开支。
