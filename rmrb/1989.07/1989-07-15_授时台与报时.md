When people hear the pleasant time signal from the radio, they might think that this highly accurate "point" is broadcast directly from Beijing. In fact, it is provided by the timekeeping center of China—the Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences—and then relayed by Beijing Observatory and broadcast by the Central People's Radio Station.

The Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory is the largest modern timekeeping center in China. Previously, China used shortwave time signals. In 1973, with state approval, a longwave time signal project was established at the Shaanxi Astronomical Observatory. After 13 years of effort, the longwave time signal system was finally built, including: atomic time and frequency standard, longwave transmission station, reception and comparison systems, and the establishment of monitoring stations.

Since the completion of the longwave time signal station, China's timekeeping accuracy has been improved by 1,000 times, from the millisecond (thousandth of a second) level to the microsecond (millionth of a second) level. It can achieve an error of plus or minus 1 second over 30,000 to 300,000 years, making China's atomic time system rank among the world's best. Its establishment has contributed significantly to the successful completion of multiple national tasks, such as long-range rocket launches, scientific experiment satellites, synchronous communication satellites, meteorological satellites, and underwater launches of nuclear submarines, thus making important contributions to the development of China's socialist construction.

    授时台与报时
    听到收音机悦耳的报时声，人们或许会以为这个精确度极高的“点”是从北京直接报的，它是由我国的报时中心——中国科学院陕西天文台授时给北京天文台，再由中央人民广播电台播发。
    陕西天文台是我国规模最大的现代化授时中心。以前我国一直采用短波授时。1973经国家批准，在陕西天文台建立长波授时工程。经13年努力，终于建起了长波授时系统，它包括：原子时间频率基准、长波发射台，接收和比对系统，建立监测站。
    长波授时台建成以来，把我国的授时精度提高了1000倍，即由毫秒（千分之一秒）量级提高到微秒（百万分之一秒）量级，可达到3万年至30万年误差正负1秒，使我国的原子时系统进入世界先进行列。它的建立为多次圆满完成国家下达的远程运载火箭、科学实验卫星、同步通讯卫星、气象卫星和核潜艇水下发射等的授时任务，为我国社会主义建设的发展做出了重要的贡献。
