Japan's economy has previously endured two severe oil crises. Since the second half of 1985, the rapid appreciation of the yen has presented new and unprecedented challenges to Japan, a nation heavily reliant on trade. However, Japan has swiftly undertaken comprehensive structural adjustments, reducing its massive trade surplus, expanding domestic demand, and improving living standards. The 1988 Japanese Economic White Paper acknowledged this success, emphasizing that the key to Japan's smooth economic restructuring lies in the private sector's full utilization of its own vitality. These enterprises have timely shifted their operational focus to the domestic market and ventured into new high-tech fields.

What characteristics and secrets have enabled Japanese enterprises to exhibit such strong vitality and adaptability in recent years? Economists from various countries have explored the unique Japanese management practices, such as lifetime employment, Japanese-style decision-making, and enterprise-based unions. While these factors are indeed crucial to Japan's economic development, several more universally applicable factors warrant further discussion.

Firstly, the immense technological potential of Japan's manufacturing sector has driven the complex and arduous structural adjustments. Economic development is not merely reflected in production volume and value but, more importantly, in the level of technological advancement and its application. This time, Japan's economic prosperity has been primarily driven by its manufacturing sector. Since the first half of last year, the production of 13 key industrial products, including semiconductors, electronic computers, word processors, fax machines, multi-program CNC machine tools, automobiles, and ethylene, has reached record highs since the war. It is well-known that Japan's numerous industrial technologies are world-class. Technologies such as new materials, mechanical processing, and electronics have long been at the forefront. A series of high-end machine tools, such as CNC machine tools and various industrial robots, have maintained the world's highest technological level and production volume since 1982. Semiconductors, often referred to as the "grain of industry," are no exception. With these advanced technologies, Japan has been able to swiftly implement industrial structural adjustments and produce world-class products.

Secondly, Japan's various industries boast a large number of outstanding contemporary entrepreneurs. They excel in leveraging their companies' technological advantages, skillfully utilizing market mechanisms, and demonstrating a tenacious pursuit of excellence. Japanese managers and plant directors typically graduate from university, possess high educational levels, and have worked diligently for 20 to 30 years in lifetime employment system enterprises. They have risen through the ranks from ordinary clerks, technicians, and salespeople, undergoing extensive practical training and in-house and external education. Consequently, they are adept at understanding their companies' intricacies, identifying problems, analyzing them, and finding solutions. They are also skilled at fostering a sense of unity with ordinary employees, forming a labor-management "community of fate," and enhancing cohesion.

Since the second half of 1985, the yen's rapid appreciation has posed challenges for many enterprises, particularly export-oriented ones, leading to widespread losses. Faced with this situation, managers and directors have taken bold measures, implementing comprehensive rationalization and actively promoting "slimming" operations to make enterprises more agile and streamlined. As a result, from 1987 to 1988, these enterprises began to turn losses into profits, with monthly earnings steadily increasing, and some even surpassing pre-yen appreciation levels. Reviewing Japan's post-war economic development history, we find that approximately every few years or decade, Japan undergoes a "slimming operation." Due to effective "slimming," Japan has successfully overcome two severe oil crises and this time has swiftly and smoothly emerged from the significant challenges posed by the yen's appreciation.

Lastly, Japanese enterprises possess flexible and harmonious labor-management relations. In Japan, management and employees work together, viewing internal difficulties as their own and collectively overcoming them. The key to managing a factory is managing people. The human factor is paramount. Japanese enterprises have largely achieved the following: management understands and respects employees, thereby gaining their trust and fully exercising their management autonomy, boldly mobilizing and utilizing employees. To overcome the difficulties brought by the yen's appreciation, they have streamlined organizations, adjusted deployments, and sometimes even transferred production technicians or mid-level cadres to sales companies or subsidiary companies for service work. However, those transferred have diligently undertaken unfamiliar and challenging tasks without complaint. Japanese employees understand that slacking off or striking may seem brave and combative, but if the enterprise suffers losses and declines, ultimately, they too will be affected, and it will have adverse effects on society. Generally, they do not cause trouble for the manager simply because their wages are slightly lower, bonuses are fewer, or work arrangements are unsatisfactory; instead, they act according to factory and company regulations.

Each country has its unique national conditions, and while Japanese management methods can be referenced, they cannot be blindly copied. However, this is indeed the general approach Japanese enterprises have adopted to enhance their adaptability and overcome the challenges posed by oil crises and yen appreciation.

    日本企业的应变能力
    东海林清
    过去日本经济曾遭受过两次石油危机的猛烈冲击，1985年下半年起又由于日元汇率急剧轮番升值，给“贸易立国”的日本带来了新的、前所未有的严峻困难，但日本以较快的速度进行全面性的结构调整，减少巨额外贸顺差，扩大国内需求，提高人民生活水平。1988年日本《经济白皮书》对此予以肯定，并强调指出：日本经济结构调整顺利的主要原因在于民间企业充分发挥了自身的活力。它们不失时机地将经营重点转向国内市场，向新的高技术领域进军。
    那么，近年来给日本经济以强大活力，表现出灵活应变能力的日本企业究竟有哪些特点？有什么奥秘？世界各国的经济界人士曾从各个角度探索欧美各国所没有的纯日本式经营法，如终身雇佣制、日本式决策方式和企业内工会机制等。这些因素的确是日本经济发展的重要因素，但下述几个较有普遍意义的因素更值得提出来加以进一步探讨。
    首先，日本制造业的巨大技术潜力促进了繁重而复杂的结构调整。经济的发展水平不仅体现于产量与产值，更重要的，还要看科技水平的高低及其应用。这次的日本经济的繁荣，制造业仍然是主要的牵引力。去年上半年以来，半导体元件、电子计算机、文字处理机、传真机、多程序数控机床、汽车以及乙烯等13种主要工业品产量均创战后最高纪录。众所周知，日本的众多产业技术是世界第一流的。有的技术如新材料、机械加工和电子技术等早已名列前茅。一系列高档机床如数控机床以及各种产业机器人的技术水平和产量，自1982年以来一直居世界首位。号称产业粮食的半体导也是如此。日本既然有这一系列高技术，也就不难应用它来迅速实现产业结构的调整，生产出饮誉全球的一流产品。
    其次，日本各类产业中拥有一大批当代优秀企业家。他们善于发挥本企业的技术优势，熟练地运用市场机制，并具有经营者顽强追求的精神。日本的经理、厂长多是在大学毕业后参加工作，知识水平较高，在终身雇佣体制企业中已勤奋工作二、三十年，从普通的办事员、技术员和推销员经过长期实践锻炼和厂内外培训后提拔上来的。因而他们善于掌握企业内情，找出问题、分析问题和解决问题。他们善于与一般职工打成一片，形成劳资“命运共同体”，提高凝聚力。
    从1985年下半年起日元急剧升值，许多企业尤其是外向型企业经营遇到困难，普遍亏损。面对这种情况，厂长、经理们便大刀阔斧地采取果断措施，实行全面合理化，积极推行“减肥消肿”经营，使企业行动更灵活，轻装上阵。结果，从1987年至1988年期间即开始扭亏为盈，收益逐月提高，有的已超过日元升值前的水平。回顾战后日本经济发展史，我们便发现差不多每数年或十年进行一次“减肥大手术”，由于“减肥”有方，曾成功地克服了两次严重的石油危机，这次又较快较顺利地摆脱了日元升值所带来的极大困境。
    最后，日本企业具有灵活而良好的劳资关系。在日本，经营者与职工上下一心，都将厂内的困难看成是自己的困难，齐心合力地去克服。治厂之道乃是治人之道。人的因素是第一位的。日本企业基本上做到了：经营阶层能了解职工，尊重职工，因而取信于职工，能充分发挥经营自主权，大胆调动和使用职工。为克服日元升值带来的困难，他们精简了机构，调整了部署，有时甚至让从事生产的技术工人或中层干部调到销售公司或到子公司做服务性工作，而被调动的人却能毫无怨言地勤奋从事陌生而艰难的工作。日本的职工们深知：怠工或罢工貌似勇敢，富于斗争性，但企业如果亏损衰退，到头来连他们自己也蒙受损失，而且会给社会造成不良影响。他们一般不会因工资比别人稍低，奖金少，或工作安排不顺心，就去找厂长的麻烦，而是依厂规社章办事。
    每个国家的国情各异，日本式经营方法虽可借鉴，不能照搬，但是，这的确是日本企业增强应变能力、渡过石油危机和日元升值带来的困难的普遍做法。（附图片）
