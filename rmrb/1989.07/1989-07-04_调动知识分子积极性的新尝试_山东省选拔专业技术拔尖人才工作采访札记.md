In Shandong, people have reason to regard the emergence of the first batch of outstanding technical talents as a significant event. This is not only because the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, as a functional department of the Party, has done this work meticulously and solidly, "setting a good example nationwide"; nor is it merely because 2,397 outstanding talents at various levels are making outstanding contributions in their respective positions for the province's development, winning widespread acclaim. It is also because the 830,000 intellectuals in Shandong have shown an unprecedented excitement and vigor, with their enthusiasm and creativity bursting forth in a miraculous way...

However, during the interviews with the responsible comrades of the Intellectuals Work Section of the Provincial Committee's Organization Department, I found that they discussed more issues beyond the specific work. They were seriously seeking out the shortcomings and lessons learned so far (despite the fact that they had not received any negative feedback so far). They attempted to prove that this work had created a new model for introducing a competitive mechanism into intellectual development. They also tried to affirm that in the new era and new situation, China's cadre system would have to undergo some reforms...

The Real Core Issue

"We have found that the full implementation of the Party's policy on intellectuals has removed the spiritual shackles and life worries of the broad masses of intellectuals, greatly changing their spiritual outlook, and their enthusiasm for dedicating themselves to modernization has reached an unprecedented height. Advanced figures who do not seek personal gain and actively contribute have emerged in various fields. However, looking at the entire county, only 39% of intellectuals have achieved outstanding results, 57% have mediocre performance, and 4% have done nothing. This means that the enthusiasm and creativity of a considerable number of intellectuals have not been fully mobilized. The reasons are: first, the management of intellectuals uses the management model of Party and government cadres, lacking specific goals and scientific assessment and evaluation, resulting in egalitarianism and 'big pot' meals in terms of treatment, causing some people to be content with the status quo, lacking the spirit of struggling for the cause; second, no environment has been created for intellectuals to showcase their talents. Even if there is a 'posting and challenging' within the enterprise, there is a lack of 'eager seeking of talents' throughout society. Therefore, we must find a new way in management methods that can inspire intellectuals to strive forward and play a role."

This is a passage from an investigation report by the Organization Department of the Schouguan County Committee of the Communist Party of China.

This is almost the entire background of Shandong Province's selection of outstanding technical talents.

The comrades of the Intellectuals Work Section of the Provincial Committee's Organization Department said: After investing a great deal of effort for many years to implement policies for intellectuals and solve historical legacy issues, we have encountered the real core issue—how to fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of intellectuals. Today, we select outstanding technical talents and provide a series of special and preferential treatments from monthly allowances to medical care, from working conditions to learning opportunities through this "separate dining" management model. Not only has it broken the long-standing "big pot" meal of intelligence, but it has also produced the positive effect of "solving a part and inspiring a large area."

Indeed, for outstanding talents, their honors and treatments come from a selection process that is the most stringent in standards, the most open in procedures, and the most competitive. Moreover, they must undergo annual performance evaluations and only those who continue to make outstanding contributions within 5 years (provincial level) or 3 years (municipal level) can retain the "crown."

This dynamic management of rewards linked to contributions has finally shed the previous practice of "sitting in a row, eating fruits," changing the universal mentality of seeking benefits. Those selected feel pressure, and those not selected feel motivated, which is the mechanism of competition. While providing equal opportunities and stages for outstanding talents at various levels to realize their aspirations, it also inspires more outstanding talents to emerge.

This is why more than 95% of the outstanding talents have outstanding achievements and are widely respected;

This is why the work of selecting outstanding technical talents in Shandong has gained increasing reputation, with recommendations and self-recommendations pouring in...

A Unique Army, Unique Management

Chang Chuanping, 27, is the deputy director of the Measurement and Energy-Saving Section of the Zhangdian Ceramics Factory in Zibo City. When the previous administrative relationship between cadres and intellectuals in terms of political treatment was gradually expanded to living treatment and even salary treatment, he, along with more than 200 other provincial-level outstanding talents, enjoyed the health care treatment that only department-level cadres had; he also received a monthly allowance of 50 yuan from the government, equivalent to an increase of four salary grades.

Compared to their actual contributions, this "preference" itself is not significant, but what is truly commendable is the Party's organization department that provides this "preference" policy.

In the past, they only managed "officials" (Party and government leaders at various levels), but now they also manage "families" (outstanding experts, outstanding talents, etc.). The organization department's work faces a new topic: when the proportion of intellectuals in our cadre team is increasing, and some of them with outstanding management abilities are inevitably selected to various levels of Party and government leadership positions, do we therefore use "granting official titles" as a common approach to solving the issues of intellectuals' status and treatment? Unfortunately! This will forever be the path for a very small number of intellectuals. In reality, we should not and cannot let the "state champions" of every industry become "officials." We can only treat the elites of various industries and all intellectuals as a unique productive force army, adopting unique methods, including Shandong Province's unique spiritual evaluation and material reward methods for outstanding talents, to manage them. All this may inevitably bring some impact and transgression to the existing cadre system and distribution system.

But we seem to have nothing to worry about, because all outstanding talents support this management. They deeply feel the Party's concern for intellectuals and the closer relationship between the Party and intellectuals, and feel the real improvement of the status of Chinese intellectuals!

Hope Lies in the Development of Socialist Planned Commodity Economy

Of course, we understand: the improvement of the status of intellectuals relies on the improvement of the social value of knowledge; in other words, it relies on the improvement of the degree of knowledge in society.

When I asked: In Shandong Province, apart from these outstanding talents who make up one in ten thousand, how is the treatment issue of the broad masses of intellectuals solved?

It relies on the development of the socialist planned commodity economy! The response from the leaders of the Intellectuals Work Section of the Organization Department is rich in historical perspective. They truly believe that their work is only a "historical transition," a "necessary organizational intervention" under "China's national conditions and the Party's current political line," to create a good environment and conditions for intellectuals with outstanding contributions, so that they can produce more results and faster results. This is to promote the true formation of a social atmosphere of respecting talents and respecting knowledge throughout the society, thereby inspiring and guiding the broad masses of intellectuals to dedicate themselves to a socialist planned commodity economy society that can provide them with more competition opportunities and a broader stage for activities.

We learned that the most fundamental condition for evaluating outstanding talents is achievements, contributions, and academic attainments. For those engaged in scientific research, the main focus is on the award situation of research results and the value and economic benefits of the results; for academic leaders and those engaged in basic research, the main focus is on the current position in a certain discipline, the size of the leading role, and the depth of professional attainments; for those engaged in patents and applied sciences, the main focus is on social benefits and economic benefits.

The responsible person of the Intellectuals Work Section explained: In the end, we are experimenting with using the value law of socialist commodity economy to manage intellectuals, using productivity as the fundamental standard to measure the value of knowledge.

Knowledge can only fully demonstrate its value when it enters society; society can only continuously improve its cultural quality by enriching knowledge. The socialization of knowledge and the knowledgeization of society seem to make intellectuals more possess the status of laborers, and their status is obtained through the actual effect of knowledge and ability in socialized labor. The selection of outstanding talents in Shandong Province, as long as they meet the conditions, regardless of whether they are workers, peasants, or cadres, without looking at the depth of seniority, the height of academic qualifications, and professional titles, they can all have the opportunity to participate in the selection. In the first batch of provincial-level outstanding talents, there are 11 with junior technical positions and 18 without technical positions, including 3 who are workers of collective ownership and 1 who is a peasant.

Therefore, we might as well say that the selection and management of outstanding technical talents is not so much an initiative of the organization as it is a necessity for the socialist planned commodity economy to promote the socialization of knowledge.

The hope of Chinese intellectuals and the hope of China lie precisely in the prosperity and development of China's socialist planned commodity economy!

    调动知识分子积极性的新尝试
    ——山东省选拔专业技术拔尖人才工作采访札记
    黄传芳
    在山东，人们有理由把首批专业技术拔尖人才的产生当作一件引人注目的大事。这不仅仅在于作为党的职能部门——山东省委组织部将这项工作做得有板有眼、扎扎实实，“在全国带了个好头”；也不仅仅在于2397名各级拔尖人才在各自不同的岗位上为全省的腾飞做出卓越贡献，赢得口碑载道；还在于83万齐鲁知识分子那种前所未有的兴奋和振作，其积极性和创造性正奇迹般地迸发出来……
    然而，在采访组织部知识分子工作处负责同志的过程中，我发觉他们谈论更多的却是具体工作之外的问题。他们十分认真地在寻找迄今为止的不足和教训（尽管迄今为止，他们还没有收到一条负面意见）。他们试图证明这项工作创造了把竞争机制引入智力开发的一个新模式，他们也试图肯定在新时期、新形势下中国的干部制度将不得不进行某种改革……
    真正核心的问题
    “我们发现：党的知识分子政策的全面落实，解除了广大知识分子精神上的枷锁和生活上的后顾之忧，精神面貌发生了很大变化，献身现代化的积极性空前高涨，各行各业涌现出许多不讲索取、积极贡献的先进人物。但是从全县来看，知识分子中工作成绩比较突出的仅占39％，工作平庸的占了57％，还有4％无所作为。也就是说全县相当数量的知识分子的积极性、创造性还没有充分调动起来，究其原因，一是在知识分子的管理上套用党政干部的管理模式，缺乏具体的目标要求和科学的考核、评价，因而在待遇上仍然是平均主义和‘大锅饭’，造成部分人员安于现状，不求上进，缺乏为事业而拚搏的精神；二是没有为知识分子施展才华创造一个大的环境，即便有企业范围的‘张榜打擂’，却缺乏全社会的‘求贤若渴’，因此必须在管理方法上走出一条能够激发知识分子人人奋进、个个发挥作用的新路子。”
    这是中共招远县委组织部一份调查报告上的一段话。
    这也几乎就是山东省选拔专业技术拔尖人才的全部背景。
    省委组织部知识分子工作处的同志说：在多年来付出极大精力为知识分子落实政策、解决历史遗留问题之后，我们却碰到了真正核心的问题——如何充分调动知识分子的积极性和创造性。今天，我们选拔专业技术拔尖人才，并从每月津贴到医疗保健，从工作条件到学习机会等方方面面给予一系列特殊而优惠的待遇，通过这种“分灶就餐”的管理模式，不但打破了经营有年的智力“大锅饭”，而且出现了“解决一部分，激励一大片”的积极效应。
    的确，对于拔尖人才，他们的荣誉和待遇来自一次具有最严格的标准、最公开的程序和最有竞争性的遴选。而且，他们必须每年接受业务考核，并只有在5年（省级）或3年（市地级）内继续做出突出贡献者，才能保持“桂冠”。
    这种待遇与贡献挂钩的动态管理，终于摆脱了过去“排排坐、吃果果”的做法之下人们普遍养成的索取心态，选上的感到有压力，选不上的感到有动力，这就是竞争的机制。它在为各级拔尖人才提供施展抱负的均等机会和舞台的同时，激励更多的优秀人才脱颖而出。
    这就是为什么95％以上的拔尖人才实绩突出，深孚众望；
    这就是为什么选拔专业技术拔尖人才工作在山东声誉日隆，推荐、自荐者纷至沓来……
    独特的大军，独特的管理
    27岁的常传平，是淄博市张店陶瓷厂计量节能科的副科长。当过去那种行政干部与知识分子之间人为的政治待遇对应关系被逐渐扩展到生活待遇甚至工资待遇时，他和省里其他200多名省级拔尖人才一样，破天荒享受着厅级干部才有的保健医疗待遇；每月还从政府那里获得50元的津贴费，相当于长了四级工资。
    比起他们的实际贡献，这种“优惠”本身并不足道，而真正值得称道的是给予这种“优惠”政策的党的组织部门。
    过去只管“长”（党政各级领导干部），而现在还要管“家”（优秀专家、拔尖人才等），组织部门的工作面临一个崭新的课题：当知识分子在我们干部队伍中的比例越来越大，他们中的一些具备优秀管理才能的人正不可避免地被选拔到各级党政领导岗位上时，我们是否因此把“封官取士”作为解决知识分子地位和待遇问题的一个经常思路？遗憾！这永远只是极少数知识分子的出路。在现实中，我们不应该也不可能让行行出的“状元”都成为“官员”，我们只能将各行各业的精英和全体知识分子作为一支独特的生产力大军，采取独特的方式，包括山东省对拔尖人才的这种独特的精神评价和物质报偿方式来管理，这一切也许不可避免地要给既存的干部制度与分配制度带来某种冲击和僭越。
    但我们似乎不必担心什么，因为所有的拔尖人才都拥护这一管理。他们从中深深感受到党对知识分子的关心和党与知识分子关系的更加密切，感受到中国知识分子地位实实在在的提高！
    希望在于社会主义有计划商品经济的发展
    当然，我们明白：知识分子地位的提高端赖于知识的社会价值的提高；换言之，端赖于社会的知识化程度的提高。
    当我问：在山东省，除了这占万分之三的拔尖人才外，广大知识分子的待遇问题怎么解决？
    靠社会主义有计划商品经济的发展！组织部知识分子工作处领导的回答富有历史的眼光。他们真实地认为自己的工作只是“历史的过渡”，是“在中国的国情和党的现阶段政治路线”下，通过“给有突出贡献的知识分子创造良好的环境和条件，使之多出成果，快出成果”这样一种“必要的组织干预”，以促进整个社会“尊重人才、尊重知识”风气的真正形成，从而激励、引导广大知识分子投身于一个能为之提供更多的竞争机会与更广阔的活动舞台的社会主义有计划商品经济的社会之中。
    我们了解到，评审拔尖人才最根本的条件是成果、贡献和学术造诣。对从事科研工作的，主要看科研成果的获奖情况和成果的价值、经济效益；对学术带头人和从事基础研究的，主要看现在在某一学科所处的地位、带头作用的大小及专业造诣的深浅；对搞专利和应用科学的，主要看社会效益和经济效益。
    知识分子工作处的负责人解释道：说到底，我们在试验采用社会主义商品经济的价值规律来管理知识分子，用生产力作为根本标准来衡量知识的价值。
    知识只有走向社会，才能充分显示其价值；社会只有充实知识，才能不断提高其文明素质。知识社会化和社会知识化似乎使知识分子更具备劳动者的出身，其地位则由知识与才能在社会化劳动中的实际效果而获取。山东省拔尖人才的推荐选拔只要符合条件，不论工人、农民、干部，不看资历深浅，学历、职称高低，都可以有参选机会。在首批省级拔尖人才中，初级技术职务的有11名，无技术职务的18名，其中还有3人是集体所有制工人、1人是农民。
    因此，我们与其说选拔管理专业技术拔尖人才是组织的提倡，毋宁说是社会主义有计划商品经济推动知识社会化的必然。
    中国知识分子的希望与中国的希望恰恰在于中国社会主义有计划商品经济的繁荣与发展！
