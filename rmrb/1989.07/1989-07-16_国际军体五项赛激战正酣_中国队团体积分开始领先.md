The International Military Pentathlon Championship's second event, the obstacle course, took place today. The Chinese team performed exceptionally well, with Captain Zhang Deli securing the highest score of 2:19.9. The team's overall points have now taken the lead.

The obstacle course is a 500-meter race featuring 20 obstacle combinations, testing speed, strength, skill, and courage in a comprehensive military training exercise.

In today's competition, our athletes demonstrated the brave and tenacious fighting spirit of the People's Liberation Army, fearlessly overcoming challenges. In the intense contest, our team secured three out of the top eight positions. Besides Zhang Deli's first place, Yang Chunyi took third, and Zhang Jing secured sixth. Our team's total score has risen from second place yesterday to first. The Swiss team also performed notably, currently in second place, with Brazil in third.

Major General Wang Kezhong, the head of the Chinese delegation, stated, "Our pre-competition preparations were thorough, and our technical execution and tactical use during the competition have been effective. I am satisfied with the athletes' performance. Although we are currently leading, there are still three events to go, and we must not be complacent."

    障碍跑全程500米，中间设置20个障碍组合，是一个比速度、比力量、比技巧、比勇气的综合军事训练科目。
    在今天的比赛中，我国选手发扬了我军勇猛顽强、不畏艰险的战斗风格，在激烈的争夺中，前8名选手，我队占3名，除张德利获第1名外，杨春义获第3名，张晶获第6名。我团体总分已从昨天的第2名上升到第1名。瑞士选手表现也令人瞩目，团体总分现居第2，巴西居第3。
    中国代表团团长王克忠大校说，我们赛前准备较充分，赛中技术发挥正常，战术运用得当。我对队员们的表现满意。我们现在虽然已开始领先，但后面还有3个项目，还不能掉以轻心。
