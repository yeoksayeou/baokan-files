Title: Using "Fellowship" to Harm Public Interests and Enrich Oneself; Trapping the State and Corrupting Officials

During interviews with some enterprises in Shanghai, reporters discovered that various fellowship activities are becoming increasingly prevalent. Some small and medium-sized enterprises receive multiple invitations for membership recruitment and fellowship activities within a couple of months; well-known and powerful large enterprises receive even more such invitations.

A charter of a certain Sino-foreign enterprise club, which was sent along with an invitation letter, stipulates: the club headquarters provides various Chinese and Western dishes, cold meals, beverages, and other services for members; offers the latest movies, videos, swimming, sauna, billiards, golf, mahjong, and bridge entertainment; organizes members to go abroad for inspections and exchanges, and participate in overseas exhibitions; regular activities are held at hotels such as Jinjiang Hotel, Huating Hotel, and Xijiao Hotel. The condition is that each Chinese enterprise pays 5000 yuan, and each foreign enterprise pays 2000 US dollars.

What should be activities for fostering friendship and enhancing camaraderie have now become places to take and eat public funds. Some upright entrepreneurs are deeply concerned: if this trend is not curbed, not only will the state suffer losses, but it will also corrupt enterprise leaders.

Enterprise leaders becoming the best invitees for various "fellowship" activities is not because the organizers of "fellowship" particularly value the personal qualities of entrepreneurs. The various "services" are not out of genuine care for entrepreneurs; in essence, they are only eyeing the public funds managed by them.

Responsible entrepreneurs dare not speak out against the various improper practices in "fellowship" activities. Because those who come to fellowship with the enterprise are either "connections" related to the factory's production or past or present superiors in some capacity. A certain system's entrepreneurs' fellowship association held a founding ceremony, and at the same time as sending invitations to enterprises within the system, they also enclosed a receipt for the membership fee of 2000 yuan. Who could refuse to "support"?

The various "services" used as bait in fellowship activities are like sugar-coated bullets to enterprise leaders with weak willpower. Squandering state funds to make personal gains, this kind of "fellowship" has become a "malignant tumor" affecting the integrity of enterprise leaders.

### 借联谊损公肥私  坑国家腐蚀干部  正直企业家对“联谊”歪风竟敢怒不敢言

    借联谊损公肥私  坑国家腐蚀干部
    正直企业家对“联谊”歪风竟敢怒不敢言
    记者在上海一些企业采访时发现，名目繁多的联谊活动大有蔓延之势。一些不起眼的中小企业，一两个月内即收到以吸收会员、开展联谊活动等名义发来的请柬多份；有名望有实力的大企业收到的类似请柬就更多。
    一份随邀请书寄上的某中外企业家俱乐部章程规定：俱乐部本部专为会员提供各类中西餐、冷餐、饮料等；提供最新电影、录像以及游泳、桑拿浴、桌球、高尔夫球、麻将、桥牌等娱乐活动；组织会员出国考察交流，参加国外展览；经常活动地点在锦江饭店、华亭宾馆、西郊宾馆。条件是中方每一企业交纳人民币5000元，外方每一企业交纳美金2000元。
    应该是联络感情、增进友谊的联谊活动，现在却成了拿公的、吃公的好去处。一些正直的企业家对此深表忧虑：此风不刹，不但国家遭受损失，对企业领导人也是一种腐蚀。
    企业领导人成为种种“联谊”活动的最佳被邀请者，并非“联谊”的主办者特别看重企业家的人格才情，种种“服务”也不是出自对企业家的真正爱护，说穿了只不过是看中了他们掌管的公家的“钱袋”。
    有责任心的企业家对“联谊”中的种种不正之风敢怒而不敢言。因为要来与企业联谊的，不是与本厂生产有利害关系的“关系户”，就是过去或现在某方面的上级。某系统企业家联谊会召开成立大会，给系统内企业发邀请书的同时，就寄上会费2000元的收据，谁还能不“惠予支持”？
    “联谊”活动中作为诱饵的种种“服务”，对意志薄弱的企业领导人，不啻是一颗颗糖衣炮弹。慷国家之慨，捞个人外快，这种“联谊”已成为影响企业领导人廉洁的“恶性肿瘤”。
