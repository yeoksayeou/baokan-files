The main construction of the "World's Largest Buddha" statue at Hong Kong's "Tian Tan" has now been completed. The last batch of Buddha body panels and head sections were shipped from Nanjing to Hong Kong today. This Buddha statue consists of 202 body casting pieces, which were transported to Hong Kong in six batches by water. The Buddha, which is 26.4 meters tall, equivalent to a nine-story building, is the world's tallest outdoor bronze Buddha. The installation of this Buddha at the Po Lin Monastery in Hong Kong is progressing smoothly. Currently, the installation has reached the seventh layer of the chest, and it is expected to be completed by September this year.
