The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection emphasized during the study and implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee that various levels of the Party's discipline inspection agencies must exert great effort to strengthen enforcement and case handling work. With strict discipline, good Party conduct will be maintained, and the implementation of the Party's basic line will be ensured.

Recently, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, while deeply studying and understanding the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and several important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, has seriously studied the strengthening of enforcement and case handling work. From the situation in the first half of the year, various levels of discipline inspection agencies, under the leadership of the Party committees, have implemented the policy of strict governance of the Party, and the number of cases handled has significantly increased compared to the same period last year. The situation of enforcement and case handling work is good. Especially in some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, the main leaders of the Party committees have personally taken charge, assigned cases, and made new breakthroughs in those cases that are seriously harmful and have a significant impact. By the end of June, of the 23 important cases directly handled or overseen by the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, 16 have been investigated and concluded or are pending conclusion. Nationwide, provincial and ministerial-level discipline inspection agencies have directly handled or overseen 926 important cases, with 303 investigated and concluded or pending conclusion. Various places generally attach importance to the handling of cases involving Party member leaders who have violated discipline. Deng Manfu, the manager and Party secretary of the Qingjiang Development Company in Hubei Province (a bureau-level cadre), took advantage of his position and work to accept gifts from others, watch obscene videos, and harass and insult women, with serious and severe behavior. The Hubei Provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection, in cooperation with relevant departments, promptly investigated the facts and, with the approval of the Provincial Party Committee, has given him a two-year probationary period within the Party and recommended the revocation of his administrative position. Qiu Zhixin, the former deputy chief dispatcher of the Liaoning Oilfield Exploration Bureau, took advantage of his position overseeing oil, gas, and chemical fertilizer and methanol quotas to accept so-called "benefits" and "bonuses" from six units totaling more than 50,000 yuan. The Party committee of the Liaoning Oilfield has decided to expel him from the Party, and the judicial authorities have arrested him. The Party committees and commissions for discipline inspection of Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces have also selected a number of typical cases involving Party member leaders for public handling, achieving relatively good results.

The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection believes that at present, the phenomenon of some Party members violating discipline is still very serious. In particular, the phenomenon of some Party member leaders violating discipline and even engaging in corrupt behavior has aroused the indignation of the masses, and this cannot be taken lightly. Various levels of discipline inspection agencies should, in the current and the next period, concentrate their efforts on enforcement and case handling work, especially to promptly handle those cases that are seriously harmful, have strong public reaction, and involve Party member leaders. The requirements of the Central Committee to improve Party conduct and combat corruption should be truly implemented.

	•	Strictly handle cases of serious violations of the Party's political discipline to ensure the high degree of unity in thought and politics throughout the Party. Handling cases of violations of political discipline should focus on the Party's "one center, two basic points," especially on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Currently, various levels of discipline inspection agencies should, in conjunction with the Party's organization departments, conduct a serious investigation and understanding of the performance of Party organizations and Party members, especially Party member leaders, during this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot. Those who resist and oppose the Central Committee's decisions to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, and who seriously violate Party discipline, should be strictly handled and not be indulged or tolerated; those who violate criminal law should be dealt with by judicial authorities according to law. In the future, anyone found to publicly oppose the four cardinal principles, engage in bourgeois liberalization, or resist and sabotage the implementation of the Party's basic line will be given Party disciplinary sanctions according to the severity of the offense, up to and including expulsion from the Party.

	•	Severely punish the corrupt behavior of a few Party members and cadres. Various levels of discipline inspection agencies should promptly investigate and verify the complaints and exposures by the masses regarding the violations of discipline by Party member leaders, including high-level cadres, in recent years. For those found to have violated Party discipline, regardless of their position, they should be strictly handled according to the principle of equality before Party discipline. At the same time, for the cases and clues currently in hand, they should be sorted out and promptly handled. Select important cases that have strong public reaction, significant impact, and involve Party member leaders, strengthen the forces, assign cases, focus on breakthroughs, and handle them publicly. Those who should be dismissed should be dismissed, and those who should be expelled from the Party should be expelled from the Party.

	•	Fully leverage the supervisory role of the broad Party members and the masses, and do a good job of receiving and handling complaints and accusations. Various levels of discipline inspection agencies should fully leverage the functional role of specialized agencies. For complaints and accusations made by Party members and non-Party members through letters and visits, they should be warmly received and handled, and according to the principle of division of responsibilities, they should be handed over to relevant departments and units for investigation and handling, ensuring that each case has a follow-up and each matter has a result. Attention should be paid to protecting the legal rights of complainants and accusers, and those who conduct reprisals should be thoroughly investigated and strictly handled.

	•	Strengthen close cooperation with supervisory, procuratorial, and other relevant agencies. For relatively major and complex cases, they should cooperate with each other, rely on the masses, and make all-out efforts to break through, and quickly handle them according to their division of labor. For the handling of various cases, the principle of seeking truth from facts should be adhered to, with emphasis on evidence and investigation, and strict adherence to the procedures for review and approval, so that they can withstand the test of history.

Currently, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection is listening to reports from some key provinces, municipalities, and central state organs, understanding the situation of handling major cases, and dispatching forces to various places to supervise and inspect the enforcement and case handling work. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection requires that various levels of discipline inspection agencies and all discipline inspection cadres must unswervingly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, firmly execute the Party's line, principles, and policies, and model the observance of Party and state laws and regulations. They must resolutely fight against all kinds of violations of discipline and law and corruption, and strive to seriously enforce Party discipline, improve Party conduct, strengthen Party building, and promote the development of reform and opening up and socialist construction.

    中纪委部署加强执纪办案工作
    要求抓紧查处危害严重涉及党员领导干部的案件
    新华社北京7月28日电　中央纪律检查委员会在学习贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神中强调指出，各级党的纪律检查机关必须下大力量抓好执纪办案工作，以严明的纪律，维护好的党风，保证党的基本路线的贯彻执行。
    最近，中央纪律检查委员会在深入学习领会十三届四中全会和邓小平同志几次重要讲话精神的同时，认真研究了加强执纪办案工作。从上半年情况看，各级纪检机关在党委领导下，贯彻从严治党的方针，查处案件的数量比去年同期明显增加，执纪办案工作的形势是好的。特别是一些省、区、市党委主要领导同志亲自抓，分工包案，使那些危害严重、影响较大的案件有了新的突破。截至6月底，中央纪委直接查办和过问的23起重要案件，已查清结案和待结的有16件。全国省部一级纪检机关直接查办和过问的重要案件926件，已查清结案和待结的有303件。各地普遍重视对党员领导干部违纪案件的查处。湖北省清江开发公司经理、党委书记邓曼福（正厅级干部）在任职期间，利用职务和工作之便，收受他人礼物，观看淫秽录像，调戏、侮辱妇女，情节恶劣，性质严重。湖北省纪委会同有关部门抓紧查清事实，报经省委批准，已给予其留党察看两年处分，并建议撤销其行政职务。辽宁省辽河油田勘探局原副总调度长邱智新，利用主管油、气和化肥、甲醇指标的职务之便，先后收受6个单位的所谓好处费、“奖金”等共5万多元。辽河油田党委已决定开除其党籍，司法机关已将其逮捕。黑龙江和辽宁省委、省纪委还分别选择了一批涉及党员领导干部的典型案件，公开进行处理，收到了比较好的效果。
    中央纪委认为，当前党内少数党员违反纪律的现象仍很严重，特别是一些党员领导干部的违纪现象乃至腐败行为，已引起广大群众的义愤，对此不可掉以轻心。各级纪检机关当前和今后一个时期内，要集中力量抓好执纪办案工作，特别要抓紧查处那些危害严重、群众反映强烈、涉及党员领导干部的案件，把中央关于搞好党风、惩治腐败的要求真正落到实处。
    ——要严肃查处严重违反党的政治纪律的案件，确保全党思想上、政治上的高度一致。查处违反政治纪律的案件，要紧紧抓住党的“一个中心、两个基本点”，特别是坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化这个中心内容。当前，各级纪检机关要会同党委组织部门，对在这次动乱和反革命暴乱中，党的组织和党员，特别是党员领导干部的表现情况进行认真的考察了解，发现有抵制和反对中央关于制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱决策，严重违反党纪的，要严肃查处，不得姑息迁就；触犯刑律的由司法机关依法处理。今后凡是发现有公开反对四项基本原则，搞资产阶级自由化的，抵制和破坏党的基本路线的贯彻执行的，都要视其情节轻重给予党纪处分，直至开除党籍。
    ——要严厉惩治少数党员干部的腐败行为。各级纪检机关对近年来群众检举揭发党员领导干部包括高级干部的违纪问题，要抓紧了解核实。凡查明确有违反党纪行为的，不论其职务高低，都要坚决按照党纪面前人人平等的原则，严肃进行处理。同时，对目前已掌握的案件和线索，要进行清理排队，抓紧查处。选择群众反映强烈、影响较大、涉及党员领导干部的重要案件，加强力量，分工包案，重点突破，公开处理。该撤职的坚决撤职，该开除党籍的要坚决开除党籍。　
    ——要充分发挥广大党员群众的监督作用，认真做好受理检举控告工作。各级纪检机关要充分发挥专门机构的职能作用，对党内外群众通过来信来访进行检举、控告的，要满腔热情地接待和受理，并按照分级负责的原则，交由有关部门和单位调查处理，做到件件有着落，事事有结果。要注意保护检举控告人的合法权益，对那些进行打击报复的，要彻底追究，严肃查处。
    ——要加强同监察、检察等有关机关的密切协作，对比较重大、比较复杂的案件，要相互配合，依靠群众，全力突破，按照分工迅速作出处理。对各种案件的查处，都要坚持实事求是的原则，重证据，重调查研究，严格按照审理和审批程序办理，使其经得起历史的检验。
    目前，中央纪委正在听取一些重点省、市和中央国家机关的汇报，了解掌握查处大要案的情况，并抽调力量，分赴各地，对执纪办案工作进行督促检查。中央纪委要求各级纪检机关和全体纪检干部，要坚定不移地贯彻十三届四中全会精神，坚定地执行党的路线、方针、政策，模范地遵守党纪国法，坚决同各种违纪违法行为和腐败现象作斗争，为严肃党纪，搞好党风，加强党的建设，促进改革开放和社会主义建设事业的发展而努力奋斗。
