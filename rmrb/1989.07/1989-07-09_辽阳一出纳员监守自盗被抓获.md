A cashier at the Agricultural Bank of China's Denglata Township Credit Union in Liaoyang, Li Qiang, embezzled 400,000 yuan and fled. He was apprehended on the evening of July 4 at Suzhou Railway Station.

On July 1, Li Qiang and a verification clerk from the credit union went to the neighboring Agricultural Bank branch to withdraw 500,000 yuan in cash. After withdrawing the cash, the verification clerk left briefly to use the restroom. Li Qiang, alone, took the cash back to the credit union but did not follow the proper procedure of depositing the money into the vault. Instead, he placed all the money in his desk drawer and cabinet. Before closing time, the verification clerk did not check the remaining cash, only noticing that Li Qiang had locked the drawer and placed it in the vault. The verification clerk had no idea if there was any money in the drawer or how much.

On the morning of July 3, around 6:30 AM, before any other staff members arrived at the credit union, Li Qiang entered alone, took out 400,000 yuan, and fled by train.

According to a bank official, the bank's regulations require that tasks such as cash handling, transportation, vault access, locking boxes, and verification must be performed by at least two people together. However, the Denglata Township Credit Union did not strictly enforce these regulations, allowing Li Qiang, who had only been working for two years and was just 22 years old, to exploit this loophole and easily steal 400,000 yuan and flee. It is understood that this phenomenon of having rules but not following them is not unique to this one institution within the banking system.

    辽阳一出纳员监守自盗被抓获
    新华社沈阳7月9日电　辽阳市农行灯塔乡信用社现金出纳员李强监守自盗，携款4万元潜逃，7月4日晚在苏州火车站被抓获。
    7月1日，李强同信用社的一名复核员到隔壁的农行营业部提取5万元现金。现金提取后，复核员中途去厕所。李强一人将现金拿回信用社后，没有按规定将钱款送进金库，而是全部放入自己桌上的尾箱和桌柜里。晚上下班前，复核员也没有对剩余的钱款核对清点，只是看见李强把尾箱锁上送进金库，至于尾箱里有没有钱、有多少钱根本不知道。
    7月3日早6点30分左右，在信用社人员都没有上班前，李强独自进入信用社，取出4万元乘火车潜逃。
    据市农行一位同志介绍，银行规定，取送款、押运、出入库、锁箱、复核等必须是两人以上一起进行，而灯塔乡信用社对这些制度没有严格执行，致使参加工作只有两年、年仅22岁的李强钻了空子，轻易地将4万元盗走潜逃。据了解，这种有章不循的现象在银行系统内绝非仅此一家。
