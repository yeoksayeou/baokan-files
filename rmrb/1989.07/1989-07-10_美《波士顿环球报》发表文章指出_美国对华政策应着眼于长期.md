The Boston Globe recently published an article by the paper's assistant editor, Greenway, which argues that the U.S. needs a calm and rational approach to its policy towards China, rather than resorting to inflammatory rhetoric.

The article states that U.S. diplomatic policy towards China should be focused on the long term rather than short-term gains. It emphasizes that the U.S. should not discourage cooperation with the West or those who wish to work with us.

The article notes that President Bush has already stated that he does not wish to play the "China card," but it is indeed a crucial card that should not be discarded by congressional members who cannot fully acknowledge the president's constitutional rights and duties in handling foreign policy.

The article quotes former President Nixon, who recently wrote, "The Chinese have lived for a quarter of a century without Western help," and warns that if we force them back into isolation from the West, "they can still do so."

The article concludes by reminding Congress that our friendly relations with China are not based on shared political ideologies but on national interests and the peace and stability of the Far East. If we can continue to engage with China, the world will be safer. If we cannot, there will be endless dangers.

    美《波士顿环球报》发表文章指出
    美国对华政策应着眼于长期
    本报讯　美国《波士顿环球报》不久前刊登该报总编辑助理格林韦写的一篇文章指出，美国对华政策需要冷静的思考，而不是过激的语言。
    文章说，美国对中国的外交政策应该着眼于长期，而不是短期。我们不应该给同西方的合作和想同我们合作的人泼冷水。
    文章说，布什已经说过，他不想打“中国牌”，但是这确实是一张很重要的牌，它不应该被那些不能痛痛快快承认总统有处理外交政策的宪法权利和义务的国会议员们抛弃。
    文章援引前总统尼克松最近在一篇文章中的话说：“中国人在没有西方帮助的情况下生活了1／4世纪”，万一我们迫使他们回到脱离西方的孤立状态，“他们还可以这样做”。
    文章最后指出，国会应该牢记，我们同中国的友好关系不是建立在共同的政治主张上的，而是建立在国家利益和远东的和平与稳定的基础上的。如果我们能够继续同中国往来，那么，这个世界将更加安全，如果我们不能这样做，将会有无穷无尽的危险。
