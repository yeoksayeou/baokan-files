When Qianla came to my house, she was holding this pot of golden bells. The pot is made of ceramic with vivid Tibetan patterns. The roots of the plant are thick, deeply embedded in the soil that originally came from Tibet. The stems are black, like iron castings. Under the sparse leaves, there are clusters of orange-yellow flowers that look like little golden bells hanging upside down. If there were a breeze, they would seem to ring out a beautiful melody...

I am very familiar with this pot of golden bells.

Twenty years ago, I enlisted from Guanzhong to Tibet. As soon as I arrived in the highlands, I searched everywhere for snow lotus flowers. An old soldier from Gansu with a beard laughed at me and told me that snow lotus flowers only grow at the snowline, not in the outskirts of Lhasa. Instead, he gave me this potted plant, saying it was just as good. It was planted in a large tin can that originally held pineapple fruit. The flowers were perfect, with orange-yellow bells that looked like they were made of gold. Later, this old soldier from Gansu died in the line of duty while working on a power station near Lhasa and was buried in the cemetery west of Lhasa. At that time, I watered this pot of golden bells almost every day. Each drop of water was like a tear from my eyes. Seeing this pot of golden bells, I naturally thought of my Tibetan teacher, Pingcuo.

I went to Tibet with a small violin. At that time, the regiment was putting on a play that needed an orchestra. The commander arranged for me to study at the local song and dance troupe, learning from Teacher Pingcuo. At that time, he was about forty-five or forty-six years old. The high-altitude ultraviolet rays had given him a healthy reddish-brown complexion. He was energetic and had the air of a scholar. He was an orphan; his parents had died of starvation before the 18th Army entered Tibet. He had a hard childhood and was reborn with the new Tibet. After the 18th Army entered Lhasa, he was taken into an orphanage, and later assigned to a newly formed performing troupe. The troupe sent him to study at the Sichuan Conservatory of Music in the interior, and later he was appointed as a violinist in the song and dance troupe. His violin playing had a significant influence in Lhasa and Tibet. His wife, Yujin, worked in the municipal government and had four children. The eldest was Qianla, and the other three were boys. The youngest was called Dawa, and the teacher loved him dearly, calling him "Dada."

Of course, the teacher also loved me, the military student. He always taught me patiently, guiding and inspiring my mind. He also gave me many books that were hard to find at the time, such as "The Life of Beethoven," "The Life of Tagore," and "Selected Poems of the Sixth Dalai Lama." I studied at the song and dance troupe every Saturday. Once, because we had to rush a defense project during the day, I couldn't go. In the afternoon, Teacher Pingcuo rode his bicycle for more than ten miles on a dirt road to our northern suburb construction site, waiting for me to get off work to give me a lesson. After the lesson, it was already a starry night with moonlight everywhere. Because he had something to do, he rode his bicycle back to the song and dance troupe. That figure of a person riding a bicycle under the highland night sky is forever etched in my mind. That year, the military region held an arts festival, and we received an award. To thank the teacher, I gave him this pot of golden bells that I loved.

Later, I was transferred to the military region to work in cultural affairs and left Lhasa. It had been ten years since we parted. But my soul wandered around the snowy city, and in my dreams, I often returned to the highlands. I also maintained regular correspondence with the Tibetan friends. Life is unpredictable. Unfortunately, not long after I left the highlands, Teacher Pingcuo died in a car accident during a performance. Fortunately, the teacher's children received care from the Party and the government and have all grown up. Qianla is already 26 years old and has studied for four years at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music. She is now a well-known solo singer in the Tibet Song and Dance Troupe. The eldest son works as an editor at the Tibet Daily, the second son works in the technology department of the radio station, and the youngest, the lovely "Dada," is also studying at Tibet University. Teacher's wife is in good health and enjoys her work. If Teacher Pingcuo's spirit in heaven knew about all this, I think he would be very happy!

This time, Qianla came to the interior to participate in a music event. She said I hadn't been to Tibet for several years, and her family all missed me, so her mother told her to bring this pot of flowers with her on the plane. Of course, I also miss them. The golden golden bells brought me back to the Tibetan highlands...

    雪域的吊金钟
    杨景民
    央拉来到我家时，就捧着这盆吊金钟。花盆是陶瓷的，上边有栩栩如生的藏族图案。花树根很粗，深深扎在原本是西藏的泥土里。枝杆呈黑色，如铁铸。疏朗的叶片下，一朵朵橙黄的花儿像一个个倒吊着的小金钟，如果有风，它们像会发出叮叮当当的美妙韵律似的……
    我很熟悉这盆吊金钟。
    20年前，我由关中参军到了西藏。一到高原，我就到处寻找雪莲花。那个长着胡子的甘肃老兵就笑我，告诉说雪莲花只是雪线上才有，拉萨城郊不生长，倒是送给我这盆盆景，说它一样好。它是用大号的白铁皮菠萝水果罐头筒盛栽，花正好，橙黄的吊钟儿，像由金子雕成。后来，这个甘肃老兵在修筑拉萨附近一个电站时，不幸因公殉职，长眠于拉萨西郊陵园。当时我几乎天天都给这盆吊金钟洒水，滴滴水珠像我的点点眼泪。看到这盆吊金钟，我自然也就想起了我的藏族老师平措。
    我是带着一把小提琴到西藏的。那时师、团演戏，需要管弦乐。部队首长就给我联系到地方歌舞团学习，求师于平措老师门下。当时他有四十五六岁吧，高原的紫外线恩赐给他一身红黑的健康色，干练，富有学者气质。他是个孤儿，父母亲在十八军进藏前就死于饥饿线上。他少年很苦，是随着西藏的新生而新生的。十八军到拉萨后他就被收入孤儿院，以后被分到一个新成立的文工队，文工队又送他到内地四川音乐学院学习，后来就被任命为歌舞团的小提琴演奏员。他的琴在拉萨和西藏颇有影响。师母玉珍在市政府工作，有儿女四个。大的就是央拉姑娘，下边三个全是光葫芦，最小的那个叫达瓦，老师很爱他，称他“达达”。
    当然，老师也很爱我这个部队学员。他总是手把手教我，善于诱导，耐心启发我的心智。还给我很多当时极难找到的如《贝多芬传》、《泰戈尔传》、《达赖六世诗选》那样的书看。我每个星期六到歌舞团学习。一次，因为白天国防施工要赶活儿，没去成。平措老师下午竟骑着自行车赶十几里的土砂路，到我们的北郊工地，等我下工后给我补课。授完课，已是繁星满天，月辉满地。因为有事，他又骑着车子回歌舞团去。那高原夜色下的行车人的背影在我脑海中是永远抹不掉的。那一年军区搞文艺调演，我们受到了嘉奖。为了感谢老师，我给他送去了我所喜爱的这盆吊金钟。
    以后，我被调到大军区搞文化工作，便离开了拉萨。一别竟十年之久。但我魂绕雪城，梦里常回高原，还和西藏的藏族亲人保持经常的书信联系。人生无常。不幸的是，我离开高原不久，平措老师在一次演出途中因车祸遇难。所幸的是，老师的几个儿女得到党和政府的关怀，都已长大成人。央拉已经26岁了，在上海音乐学院深造4年，现在是西藏歌舞团有一定影响的独唱演员。长子在西藏报社当编辑，次子在广播电台作技术工作，最小的那个可爱的“达达”，也在西藏大学读书。师母身体健康，工作愉快。这一切，如果平措老师的在天之灵得知，我想他也会十分高兴的！
    央拉这次是到内地参加一个音乐活动的。她说我有好几年没到西藏了，他们家的人都很想念，所以母亲叫她坐飞机出来时一定要把这盆花带给我。我当然也很想念他们。金灿灿的吊金钟，把我带到了西藏高原……
