Since 1988, our county's discipline inspection committee has repeatedly received letters from the public reporting that the county grain bureau has violated financial discipline and failed to adhere to relevant grain policies. After investigation by the discipline inspection committee, it was found that Director Li Tinglong of the grain bureau and others have committed the following errors:

1. According to regulations, the use of "A-grade" grain and oil requires approval from the State Council, and warehouse rotation requires approval from the provincial grain bureau. However, in late July of last year, Li Tinglong arbitrarily changed the instructions from the provincial bureau, agreeing to temporarily store 100,000 kilograms of rice at the Wenxin grain depot as "A-grade" grain. In reality, by the end of September, the grain depot had only 19,453.5 kilograms of rice in stock.

2. Fabricating false information and misappropriating funds totaling over 14,000 yuan. Specifically:
   - In December 1987, Li Tinglong agreed to use 7,600 yuan from the grain and oil price negotiation company as a service fee to be distributed to the company's employees and bureau staff, 200 yuan per person. To avoid paying bonus tax, he also agreed to falsify repair fee vouchers for the price negotiation company to settle accounts.
   - In June 1988, at a bureau meeting chaired by Li, he violated State Council regulations and agreed to subsidize bureau staff for travel expenses using public funds, giving each person 300 yuan. Under the influence of the county bureau, the Jiancha grain management station also used public funds to subsidize staff travel, with 17 people receiving a total of 8,500 yuan.

3. Violating regulations to expand the sale of price-negotiated grain. Despite repeated instructions from county committee and government leaders to strictly control the sale of price-negotiated rice in June last year, the practice continued, leading to a tense rice supply before National Day and creating a negative social impact.

4. Prioritizing the interests of a small group, violating regulations, fabricating false information, and using grain price differences to obtain price differential funds. From December 1986 to April 1988, a total of 652,000 yuan in price differential funds were obtained, used to cover losses and repay loans, leaving a surplus of over 400,000 yuan.

The county discipline inspection committee overcame interference and obstacles to investigate and clarify this case by the end of last year. On February 27th and March 1st, they reported to the regional grain bureau and regional discipline inspection committee. On March 3rd, the county committee's standing committee decided to remove Li Tinglong's party position and recommended removing him from his position as director of the grain bureau.

The county people's government, based on the county committee's recommendation, decided to remove Li Tinglong from his position as director and submitted the decision to the county people's congress standing committee for discussion on March 20th. Fourteen committee members attended the meeting, with eight members expressing different opinions. Some suggested that Li Tinglong is old and should not be removed from his position; others said he has merits, resulting in Li's issue remaining unresolved to this day.

Handling disciplinary cases is an important task and regular work of the party's discipline inspection agencies. However, in practice, there are many difficulties. This case is a prime example of the challenges faced. We hope that in the fight against corruption, higher-level relevant departments will support our discipline inspection work.

### 李局长不该处理吗？

    李局长不该处理吗？
    1988年以来，我县纪委不断接到群众反映县粮食局违反财经纪律和不坚持有关粮食政策问题的检举信。经纪委查实，粮食局长李廷龙等人犯有以下错误：
    一、按规定，动用“甲字”粮油应报国务院批准，仓储轮换要经省粮食局批准。但去年7月底，李廷龙擅自改动省局批示，同意用文新粮站暂存10万公斤稻谷为“甲字”粮，而实际上这个粮站到9月底，库存稻谷只有19453.5公斤。
    二、弄虚作假，滥发钱物，共计1.4万余元。其中：1987年12月，李廷龙同意由粮油议价公司拿7600元作手续费发给本公司及局机关职工，每人200元，因怕上奖金税，还同意假造维修费单据在议价公司报帐；1988年6月，李在他主持的局务会上违反国务院有关规定，同意局机关职工外出旅游，用公款补助，每人发给300元。在县局影响下，煎茶粮管所也用公款补助职工旅游，已有17人领款8500元。
    三、违反规定，扩大议价粮销售。去年6月，县委、县政府领导同志几次打招呼要严格控制大米议价销售，仍有禁不止，使国庆节前夕大米供应紧张，在社会上造成不良影响。
    四、只顾小团体利益，违反规定、弄虚作假，利用粮食差价，套取差价款。从1986年12月至1988年4月，套取差价款65.2万余元，用来抵亏损和还贷款后，现结余资金4万多元。
    县纪委排除干扰和阻力，在去年底查清了此案，今年2月27日和3月1日向地区粮食局和地纪委作了汇报，3月3日县委常委决定撤销李廷龙的党内职务，建议撤销粮食局局长职务。
    县人民政府根据县委的建议，决定撤销李廷龙局长职务，于3月20日提交县人大常委会讨论，县人大常委会14个委员出席会议，会上有8个委员提出不同看法。有的认为李廷龙老了，还是不给撤职处分吧；有的说李是有功的等，致使李的问题至今得不到处理。
    本来查处违纪案件是党的纪律检查机关的一项重要任务和经常性工作，但实际做起来困难很多，此案难于处理即是一例。希望在惩治腐败斗争中，上级有关部门支持我们纪律检查工作。
