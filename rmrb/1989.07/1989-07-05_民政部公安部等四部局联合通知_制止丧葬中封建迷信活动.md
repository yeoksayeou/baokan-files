Joint Notice from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, Public Security Bureau, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State Administration for Religious Affairs to Resolutely Stop Superstitious Activities in Funerals

The Ministry of Civil Affairs, the Public Security Bureau, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the State Administration for Religious Affairs recently jointly issued a notice to resolutely stop superstitious activities in funerals.

Currently, in some regions, especially in rural areas, superstitious activities during funeral arrangements are quite common. Some people in society, for the sake of profit, pose as shamans, spirit mediums, or fortune-tellers. Some produce and sell large quantities of superstitious funeral items. Some units provide various conveniences for employees and their families to hold elaborate funerals, and some party members and cadres even violate the central government's regulations that Communist Party members should lead by example in holding simple funerals, engaging in elaborate and superstitious funeral activities.

The notice states: No unit or individual should engage in superstitious activities such as feng shui selection, grand funerals, or yin kinship during funeral arrangements. No unit or individual should produce or sell superstitious funeral items. Existing superstitious funeral items should be confiscated and destroyed by the funeral management departments. Those who do not heed warnings will be fined or ordered to suspend business by the industrial and commercial administrative departments according to relevant state regulations. No one should engage in superstitious occupations during funerals. "Shamans," "spirit mediums," and "fortune-tellers" should be educated to stop superstitious activities voluntarily. Those who spread rumors and defraud people through superstitious activities should be punished according to law. For religious believers, funeral rituals such as holding services should be conducted in religious activity venues approved by the government.

The notice also states that in areas where cremation is practiced, cremation should be promoted, and ashes should be stored in columbaria or buried in public cemeteries. Ashes should not be placed in coffins for earth burial. State employees who do not practice cremation should not receive funeral allowances, and their units should not provide conveniences for their funeral activities. In areas where earth burial is practiced, public cemeteries should be established on barren hills and wastelands, and it is forbidden to use arable land for graves. Deep burial without mounds should be promoted to prevent random burial.

The notice requires that local civil affairs departments conduct a comprehensive survey of the production, sales, and consumption of funeral items to facilitate comprehensive management.

    民政部公安部等四部局联合通知
    制止丧葬中封建迷信活动
    本报讯　民政部、公安部、国家工商行政管理局、国务院宗教事务管理局近日联合发出了坚决制止丧葬中的封建迷信活动的通知。
    当前，在一些地区特别是农村，办理丧事中的封建迷信活动十分普遍。社会上一些人为牟取暴利，有的装巫婆、扮神汉、充当阴阳先生，有的大量生产、销售封建迷信的丧葬用品，有些单位为职工及其家属大办丧事提供多种方便，甚至个别党员干部也违反中央关于共产党员应带头简办丧事的规定，在丧事中大操大办，搞封建迷信活动。
    通知指出：任何单位和个人办理丧事，都不得搞看风水、出大殡、攀阴亲等封建迷信活动，任何单位和个人都不得生产、销售封建、迷信的丧葬用品。现有的封建迷信丧葬用品由殡葬主管部门收缴销毁。对不听劝阻的单位和个人，由工商行政管理机关根据国家有关规定予以经济处罚或责令停业整顿；任何人不得在丧事中从事封建迷信的职业活动。对“巫婆”、“神汉”、“阴阳先生”，应通过教育，使他们自觉地停止封建迷信活动。对借迷信活动造谣惑众、诈骗财物的，应依法惩处。对于信教群众为办丧事做道场等，应在政府批准开放的宗教活动场所内进行。
    通知还指出，在火葬区内要推行火葬，骨灰存入骨灰堂或安葬在骨灰公墓，不准把骨灰入棺土葬；不实行火葬的国家职工，不得享受丧葬费，所在单位也不得为其丧事活动提供方便。在土葬区内要本着有利于生产的原则，利用荒山瘠地建立公墓，禁止用耕地做墓地，提倡平地深埋不留坟头，杜绝乱埋乱葬。
    通知要求各级民政部门要对丧葬用品生产、销售和丧葬消费现状进行一次全面调查，以便进行综合治理。
