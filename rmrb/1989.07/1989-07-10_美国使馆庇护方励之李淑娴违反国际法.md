After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, who were guilty of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, sought "protection" at the U.S. Embassy in China. The U.S. Embassy in China has already granted them "shelter." This action by the United States violates international law and is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs.

Firstly, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian violates the general principles of territorial asylum in international law and infringes upon China's territorial sovereignty.

Territorial asylum in international law refers to the right of a state, based on its territorial sovereignty, to grant asylum within its territory to foreigners who seek refuge primarily for political reasons, allowing them to enter, reside, and be protected by law without being extradited to another country. Since this asylum is implemented within the territory of a state, it is called "territorial asylum" or "domestic asylum."

The legal basis for territorial asylum is the principle of state sovereignty. According to this principle, a state has territorial sovereignty and the right to grant asylum to foreigners seeking refuge within its territory. This is a recognized sovereign right of states internationally. Many countries' constitutions have specific provisions for this. The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is not the aforementioned territorial asylum but rather the sheltering of Chinese citizens within Chinese territory. This not only constitutes an infringement upon China's territorial sovereignty but also violates the recognized principles of territorial asylum.

Some international law scholars refer to the asylum granted by a state outside its territory as "extraterritorial asylum" or "diplomatic asylum." In reality, extraterritorial asylum mainly refers to diplomatic asylum, which is the granting of asylum to refugees in diplomatic missions, as well as in consulates and on warships. The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li falls under "diplomatic asylum." However, so-called "diplomatic asylum" has never been a recognized rule of international law. International law does not recognize permanent missions as having the right to diplomatic asylum. Only Latin American countries, based on long-standing customs and subsequent treaties, mutually recognize the asylum of political refugees from the host country, which is a regional exception. However, even this regional exception is not recognized by the United States. When signing the 1928 "Convention on Asylum of the American States," the United States made the following reservation: "The United States of America, in signing the present Convention, makes a clear reservation that it does not recognize and does not accept the doctrine of asylum as part of international law." The International Court of Justice, in the 1950 case of Colombia v. Peru on "asylum," confirmed that there is no such general right to diplomatic asylum. The Court also clearly pointed out: "In the case of diplomatic asylum, it is within the territory of the state where the crime was committed, deciding to grant asylum to the refugee, which involves damaging the sovereignty of that state." The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is precisely this situation, seriously damaging China's sovereignty, especially infringing upon China's territorial sovereignty.

Secondly, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian violates the provisions of the United Nations Charter and interferes in China's internal affairs.

The principle of non-interference in internal affairs is a recognized fundamental principle of international law. Article 2, paragraph 7 of the United Nations Charter affirms this principle. The 1970 Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Co-operation Among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations summarizes this principle as "the obligation to refrain from any interference in the domestic jurisdiction of any state, in accordance with the Charter," and stipulates: "No state or group of states has the right, for any reason whatever, directly or indirectly, to intervene in the internal or external affairs of any other state." The International Court of Justice, in the aforementioned case of Colombia v. Peru on "asylum," justly pointed out: "Not allowing the territorial state to exercise jurisdiction over the criminal constitutes interference in matters that are exclusively within the jurisdiction of that state."

The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li, who are wanted by Chinese public security authorities, is precisely "not allowing" China "as the territorial state to exercise jurisdiction over the criminal," thereby constituting interference in China's internal affairs and thus violating the United Nations Charter's provisions on non-interference in internal affairs.

Thirdly, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian is an abuse of diplomatic privileges and violates the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.

The 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, while stipulating that "the premises of the mission shall be inviolable," also stipulates: "The premises of the mission shall not be used in any manner incompatible with the functions of the mission as laid down in the present Convention or other rules of general international law or special agreements in force between the sending and the receiving State." More importantly, the Convention does not contain any provision granting diplomatic missions the right to diplomatic asylum.

In the aforementioned "asylum" case, the International Court of Justice, in response to Colombia's request, correctly relied on the general norms of diplomatic law, pointing out that it is not permissible to extend diplomatic immunity to those seeking asylum in diplomatic missions. Granting such asylum is essentially an abuse of the privileges of diplomatic missions. The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is a typical abuse of diplomatic privileges.

The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li also violates the provisions of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations in that it fails to fulfill the two most important obligations imposed by the Convention on those enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities: first, "respecting the laws and regulations of the receiving state," and second, "not interfering in the internal affairs of the receiving state." Regarding the latter, this has been mentioned earlier. Regarding the former, the most obvious example is: directly violating Article 162 of the Chinese Criminal Law regarding the crime of harboring and shielding; directly violating Articles 1, 2, and 4 of the first paragraph of Article 25 of China's Regulations on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities.

It should also be noted that some Western scholars, to avoid the suspicion of "abusing diplomatic privileges," have proposed a so-called "temporary asylum" theory, stating that embassies can exercise temporary asylum rights "on humanitarian grounds" and that this is a "legal right." This argument lacks both treaty law and customary international law basis and is therefore untenable.

Finally, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian also violates the international obligations undertaken by the United States and undermines the principle that treaties must be observed.

As mentioned earlier, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li violates the relevant provisions of the United Nations Charter and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, and the United States, as a contracting party to these two multilateral treaties, constitutes a violation of the international obligations undertaken by the United States and thus also violates the principle that treaties must be observed. Moreover, the United States has directly violated the provisions of the 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, the 1978 Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations, and the 1982 Joint Communiqué of August 17 regarding "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity" and "non-interference in each other's internal affairs."

Under the current circumstances, the wise choice for the U.S. government to take the initiative is to prioritize the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations and quickly instruct its embassy in China to hand over Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian to the relevant Chinese authorities for legal punishment. There is no other way to resolve this case.

    美国使馆庇护方励之李淑娴违反国际法
    富学哲
    北京平息反革命暴乱之后，犯有反革命宣传煽动罪的方励之和李淑娴到美国驻华使馆寻求“保护”，美国驻华使馆已给予“庇护”。美国的这一行动违反国际法，是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。
    首先，美国驻华使馆庇护方励之、李淑娴违反了国际法中关于领土庇护的一般原则，侵犯了中国的属地优越权。
    国际法上的庇护是指国家根据属地优越权，在该国的领土范围内，给予主要是由于政治原因而寻求避难的外国人以入境居留、受法律保护并不被引渡给他国的权利。由于这种庇护是以国家领土为其实施范围的，所以被称为“领土庇护”或“域内庇护”。
    领土庇护的法律依据是国家主权原则。根据主权原则，国家具有属地优越权，有权在自己的领土范围内给寻求避难的外国人以庇护。这是国际上公认的国家所享有的一项主权权利。许多国家的宪法对此都作了专条规定。美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二人，并不是上述的领土庇护，而是在中国的领土上庇护中国公民，这不仅构成了对中国属地优越权的侵犯，而且违背了公认的领土庇护原则。
    有些国际法学者把国家在其境外行使的庇护权称为“域外庇护”或“外交庇护”。实际上域外庇护主要是指外交庇护，即在外交使馆中庇护寻求避难者，另外也包括在领馆中的庇护和在军舰上的庇护。美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二人，就属于“外交庇护”。但是，所谓“外交庇护”从来就不是一项公认的国际法规则。国际法不承认常设使馆享有外交庇护权，只有拉丁美洲国家根据它们之间长期形成的惯例以及后来签订的公约，相互承认接受驻在国的政治犯避难，是一种地域性的例外。可是，就连这种地域性的例外，美国也不承认。美国在签署1928年《美洲国家间关于庇护的公约》时，曾作如下保留：“美利坚合众国签订本公约时，提出明白保留，指出合众国不承认并且不同意所谓庇护权的学说作为国际法的一部分。”联合国国际法院在1950年哥伦比亚诉秘鲁的“庇护权”案中曾确认，并没有此类外交庇护的一般权利。国际法院在该案中还明确指出：“在外交庇护的场合，是在犯罪地国的领土之内，决定给避难者以外交庇护，这就涉及损害那个国家的主权。”美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二人正是这种情况，严重损害了中国的主权，特别是侵犯了中国的属地优越权。
    其次，美国驻华使馆庇护方励之和李淑娴这一行动，违反了《联合国宪章》的规定，干涉了中国的内政。
    不干涉内政原则是公认的国际法基本原则之一，《联合国宪章》第2条第7款确认了这一原则。1970年《国际法原则宣言》将这一原则概括为“依照宪章不干涉任何国家国内管辖事件之义务之原则”，并规定：“任何国家或国家集团均无权以任何理由直接或间接干涉任何其他国家之内政或外交事务。”国际法院在上述哥伦比亚诉秘鲁“庇护权”案中公正地指出：“不让领土国对犯罪者行使管辖权，构成了对专属那个国家职权事项的干涉。”
    美国驻华使馆庇护已受到中国公安部门通缉的方、李二人的行动，正是“不让”中国“作为领土国对犯罪者行使管辖权”，因而构成了对中国内政的干涉，从而也就违反了联合国宪章关于不干涉内政的规定。
    第三，美国驻华使馆庇护方励之和李淑娴的行动，是滥用外交特权，违反了《维也纳外交关系公约》。
    1961年《维也纳外交关系公约》在规定了“使馆馆舍不得侵犯”的同时，又规定：“使馆馆舍不得充作与本公约或一般国际法之其他规则、或派遣国与接受国间有效之特别协定所规定之使馆职务不相符合之用途。”更为重要的是，该公约没有任何一条规定外交使馆享有外交庇护权。
    国际法院在上述“庇护权”案中，在对哥伦比亚的要求所作的答复中，正确地依据了外交法的一般规范，指出不容许将外交豁免作扩大的解释，即将它适用于在外交使馆寻求庇护的人。给予这种庇护实际上就是滥用了外交代表机关的特权。美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二犯，就是典型的滥用外交特权。
    美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二犯的行动，违反《外交关系公约》的规定还表现在：没有履行该公约为享受外交特权与豁免者所规定的两条最重要的义务，一是“尊重接受国法律规章”，二是“不干涉该国内政”。关于后者，已于前述。关于前者，最明显的是：直接触犯了中国刑法第162条关于窝藏和包庇罪的规定；直接违反了我国外交特权与豁免条例第25条第1、2、4款的规定。
    这里还应当指出，某些西方学者为避“滥用外交特权”之嫌，提出了一种所谓“暂时庇护”的理论，说使馆可“根据人道的理由”行使暂时庇护权，并说这是一种“法律权利”。这种说法既无国际条约法的依据，又无国际习惯法的依据，因而是不能成立的。
    最后，美国驻华使馆庇护方励之和李淑娴这一行动，还违背了美国所承担的国际义务，破坏了条约必须遵守的原则。
    如前所述，美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二人的行动，违背了联合国宪章和《维也纳外交关系公约》的有关规定，而美国作为这两个多边公约的缔约国，这就构成了违背美国所承担的国际义务，从而也就违反了条约必须遵守原则。不仅如此，美国还直接违背了中美1972年上海公报、1978年12月中美建交公报和1982年8月17日联合公报中关于“相互尊重主权和领土完整”、“互不干涉内政”的规定。
    在目前情况下，美国政府争取主动的明智选择是，以中美关系的大局为重，迅速指令其驻华使馆将方励之、李淑娴二犯交给中国有关当局依法惩处。舍此则没有了结此案的其他途径。
