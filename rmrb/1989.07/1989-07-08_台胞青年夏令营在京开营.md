The sixth session of the Taiwan Youth Summer Camp opened with a grand ceremony yesterday afternoon by the lush, verdant Shichahai in Beijing, where willows sway gently and drums and music fill the air.

The camp, organized by the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots Associations, has nearly 80 participants from Taiwan, the United States, and Brazil. This is the largest group of foreign tourists to visit Beijing since the suppression of the riot.

During their one-week stay in Beijing, the campers will visit famous historical sites and enterprises, engage in calligraphy and painting exchanges, and participate in various recreational activities.

    本报北京7月8日讯　记者聂传清报道：苍翠葱郁、垂柳依依的北京什刹海畔，鼓乐阵阵，彩旗猎猎，第六届台胞青年夏令营昨天下午在这里举行了隆重的开营仪式。
    由中华全国台湾同胞联谊会举办的本届夏令营，参加的台胞营员有近80人，分别来自台湾岛内、美国和巴西。这是北京市自平息暴乱以来，迎接的一个较大的外来旅游团体。
