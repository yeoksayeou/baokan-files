The first of the world's four major tennis tournaments, Wimbledon, reached its final on July 9.

The 20-year-old Graf and the 32-year-old Navratilova have faced each other 11 times in the past, with Graf winning 4 and losing 7. In their most recent 5 matches, Graf has won 3 and lost 2. Before this tournament began, Navratilova claimed to have found the secret to defeating Graf. In the first set of the final, Graf showcased her powerful forehand smashes, winning 6-2. In the second set, Navratilova took an early lead at 5-2, but Graf fought back to tie the score at 6-6. In the tiebreaker, Navratilova utilized her powerful serves and skilled backhand slices and topspins to score frequently, securing the second set. The third set became Graf's domain, as she scored directly on her serves, aggressively approached the net, and forced her opponent into errors, winning 6-1. Graf thus achieved her wish of a second consecutive Wimbledon title. Overall, Graf's all-around technique, particularly her powerful forehand smashes, is deserving of the title of contemporary queen of the tennis court; Navratilova's skills remain sharp, and she still delivers outstanding performances.

Before the men's final, Lendl and McEnroe, who had lost in the semifinals, believed the situation favored Edberg. Becker and Edberg were rivals in the final of last year's Wimbledon championship. Edberg, determined to defend his title, performed unusually in the first game of today's final, with his overhead smashes repeatedly falling into the net. In contrast, Becker's serves were powerful, and he easily won the first set 6-0. In the second set, Becker's first-serve percentage dropped significantly, and Edberg took advantage of his second serves to launch aggressive counterattacks, heating up the match. When the score reached 5-5, Becker failed to win the 11th game despite having the serve. In the 12th game, Edberg led 4-0, and the audience thought the second set was within his grasp. However, Becker utilized his backhand advantage and accurate, powerful overhead smashes to win six consecutive points, securing the 12th game despite not having the serve and being behind in the score. In the tiebreaker, Becker went on a rampage again, winning 7-1 to take the second set. Before the third set began, Edberg complained to the referee about the ball being too soft, but the referee's inspection led to the complaint being dismissed. Becker then capitalized on his momentum, leading the entire way, and won the third set 6-1, securing his third Wimbledon title. Comparing the two players, Becker's backhand technique is slightly better, and his high success rate in return serves is a key factor in his victory. Experts believe that the 21-year-old Becker and the 23-year-old Edberg will remain shining stars and competitors in the world of tennis in the 1990s.

    温布尔登桂冠争夺战
    世界四大网球赛之首温布尔登网球赛7月9日进入决赛。
    20岁的格拉夫和32岁的纳夫拉蒂诺娃过去曾11次交手，格拉夫4胜7负，最近的5次比赛格拉夫3胜2负。本届比赛开始前，纳夫拉蒂诺娃称，找到了战胜格拉夫的秘诀。决赛第一盘，格拉夫发挥了正手抽杀凌厉的优势，以6∶2取胜。第二盘纳夫拉蒂诺娃先以5∶2领先，格拉夫紧追不舍，打成6∶6。决胜局中纳夫拉蒂诺娃利用有力的发球和擅长的反手削球、抽球频频得分，拿下第二盘。第三盘又变成格拉夫的天下，发球接连直接得分，积极上网，迫使对手忙中失误，以6∶1取胜，实现了温布尔登“二连冠”的夙愿。纵而观之，格拉夫技术全面，尤其正手抽杀有力，无愧于当代网坛女王的称号；纳夫拉蒂诺娃宝刀不老，仍有上乘表演。
    男子决赛之前，在半决赛中失利的伦德尔和麦肯罗认为形势对埃德贝里有利。贝克尔和埃德贝里曾是去年温布尔登桂冠争夺的对手，矢志二连冠的埃德贝里在今天决赛的第一局中表现反常，空中截击接连下网，相反贝克尔发球有力，以6∶0轻松地拿下第一盘。第二盘中贝克尔一次发球命中率明显下降，埃德贝里利用对方二次发球积极反击得手，比赛进入白热化。打成5平后，贝克尔没有拿下有发球权的第11局。第12局埃德贝里又以4∶0领先，观众以为第二盘埃德贝里胜利在握，谁料贝克尔利用反手击球的优势和准确有力的空中截击连扳6分，竟拿下没有发球权且比分落后的第12局。决胜局中贝克尔再次打疯，以7∶1取胜，拿下第二盘。第三盘开场前，埃德贝里向裁判提出球质太软，裁判鉴定后驳回“上诉”。此后贝克尔乘胜追击，一路领先，以6∶1拿下第三盘，在温布尔登第三次夺魁。两选手相比较，贝克尔反手技术略好，接发球反击成功率高是取胜要因。行家认为，今年21岁的贝克尔和23岁的埃德贝里在90年代的世界网坛上，仍是吸引网球迷们的耀眼明星和竞争对手。
