Developing the tourism industry does not depend on pursuing high-end and luxurious accommodation conditions. The key lies in sincerely providing high-quality services to tourists. Therefore, one must think from the perspective of tourists, addressing their urgent needs and providing what they require. Through the promotion by tourists from all over the world, a good reputation for the tourism industry can be established.

The practice over the past few years has shown that tourists, especially foreign visitors, come to China with the desire to "visit famous mountains and scenic spots in their lifetime," mainly to see the local tourist attractions, historical and cultural relics, and the contemporary lifestyle rich in folk customs, rather than purely for enjoyment. For many tourists from foreign countries, traveling abroad is generally to see what they have never seen and hear what they have never heard, to dispel the mystery of the past, and to gain new knowledge and interests. If they were only seeking enjoyment, they could stay at home without moving, so why would they travel thousands of miles?

Of course, not focusing on enjoyment does not mean giving tourists a sense of "suffering." For most tourists, they simply need to meet a few basic requirements: first, convenient transportation and communication; second, a quiet and hygienic place to stay; third, polite and attentive service. These are the most basic and indispensable needs. Meeting these requirements will help tourists achieve their travel goals more smoothly. Otherwise, even if the hotel is high-end and luxurious, if other services are not up to par, tourists will be difficult to satisfy, and they might come with joy but leave with disappointment, which would be quite disappointing.

Focusing on providing high-quality services to attract foreign tourists is an essential part of developing the tourism industry. China has many unique natural and cultural landscapes, which are the "golden bowls" for developing tourism. However, in the global tourism competition, having a "golden bowl" or a "silver bowl" is not enough; ultimately, it depends on winning with high-quality services. Tourism departments in various places should not neglect the fundamentals and blindly pursue high-end and luxurious hotels. Instead, they should genuinely consider the needs of tourists, such as providing good transportation and communication services, improving the sanitation of tourist spots, developing tourist souvenirs, and so on. When tourists arrive, they should feel at home, and when they finish their tour, they should leave satisfied. Only then will our tourism industry expand its influence and thrive!

    设身处地为旅游者着想
    瓯亮
    办好旅游业，不在于追求居住条件的高级、豪华，关键在于真诚地为旅游者提供优质服务。因此，要设身处地为旅游者着想，急他们之所急，供他们之所需。通过五洲四海旅游者的宣传，建立旅游事业良好的信誉。
    这几年的实践表明，旅游者特别是外国游客到中国来，“一生好入名山游”，主要是想看看各地的旅游景观、历史文化遗迹和富有民俗情趣的当代人生活风貌，而不是完全出于享受目的。对于很多异国他乡的游客来说，外出旅游一般是为了见所未见，闻所未闻，消除往昔的神秘感，获取新知新趣。如果仅仅追求享受，他们完全可以在家不挪窝，何苦千里迢迢、万里迢迢而来呢？
    当然，不以讲求享受为主，却也不是要给人以“找罪受”的印象。对于大多数旅游者来说，无非需要满足这么几个方面：一是交通通信方便，二是有一间安静、卫生条件好的住处，三是有礼貌的周到的服务。这些是最基本的、必不可少的，做到了，就能较顺利地达到旅游的目的。否则，即使宾馆再高级，再豪华，其他的服务跟不上，旅游者也是很难满意的，甚至高兴而来，扫兴而去，那就太煞风景了。
    多在优质服务上做文章，以此吸引外国游客，是发展旅游业的题中应有之义。我国有很多得天独厚的自然景观和人文景观，是发展旅游业的“金饭碗”。然而，在世界旅游业竞争中，有“金饭碗”也好，有“银饭碗”也好，归根到底要靠优质服务取胜。各地的旅游部门，都不应舍本逐末，盲目攀比、追求高级豪华宾馆，而应切实为旅游者着想，如提供良好的交通、通信服务，改善旅游点的环境卫生，开拓旅游纪念品，等等。游客来了，宾至如归，旅游完了，满意而去。这样我们的旅游业才会扩大影响，兴旺发达起来！
