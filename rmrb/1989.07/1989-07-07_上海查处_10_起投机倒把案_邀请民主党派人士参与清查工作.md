Shanghai's investigation into 10 cases of speculation and profiteering by municipal and district-level companies is underway under the leadership of the municipal Party committee and government. Deputy Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, Zhu Daren, told a reporter that we have the resolve and the strength to resolutely eliminate corruption and regain the trust of the people.

The 10 cases currently under investigation were identified by the Shanghai Municipal Committee for the Rectification and Investigation of Company Speculation and Profiteering. These companies have engaged in various illegal activities, including the resale of imported duty-free materials, cars, commercial housing, color televisions, refrigerators, and technical rights infringements by selling blueprints, as well as the private sale of land. Of the 10 cases, 4 have been basically clarified and are now being handled, 3 require further investigation, and the remaining 3 have leads that are being followed up.

For the investigation of these 10 key cases, relevant departments will increase transparency and adopt an open approach. The first batch of three democratic party members participating in the rectification and investigation of companies and key cases have already directly participated in the investigation of three cases. Additionally, 12 members of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People's Congress have joined in the coordination and research of related cases. Simultaneously, the investigation work will increase transparency towards the media and the public, with all cases being publicly reported and continuously updated based on the progress of the investigation.

It is understood that, in addition to these 10 key cases, Shanghai will conduct a comprehensive rectification and investigation of the 2,440 companies established since the second half of 1986 and the wholesale business departments. The city is determined to close, suspend, or merge a large number of companies and business departments.
