Religion, as an important cultural and historical phenomenon, is not to be overlooked in the construction of civilization. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, religious studies have become unusually active. In recent years, in addition to the continuous emergence of monographs, journals, and specialized books, series of books are also being published. The book "The World's Ten Major Religions" edited by Huang Xinchuan will have a certain promotional effect on the study of religious issues in our country.

The book first manifests itself in its pioneering nature. Opening the table of contents, we find that many religions that are relatively lacking in research in China, such as Hinduism and Sikhism, are all listed in the book with systematic and comprehensive research and introduction, thus filling the gap in domestic research in this area. While introducing the history of various major world religions, the author has particularly strengthened the study of current development trends and characteristics, and has fully paid attention to the relationship between various major world religions and China, exploring the development of world religions in China and their impact on Chinese social culture. The author has made efforts to study religion from the complex relationship between religion and cultural progress, religion and social development, and has continuously opened up new research fields. Secondly, the book's characteristic also lies in its novel perspective. When narrating the development and evolution of various major religions and their ideological characteristics, the author has not stayed at the level of general introduction and existing conclusions, but has boldly explored and proposed many new insights. For example, when discussing the relationship between Judaism and world culture, the author emphasizes the historical origins of Christianity, Islam, and Judaism, pointing out that the ideas of the European Renaissance came from the Arabs and Jews, especially the role of Jews in introducing Arab Greek cultural heritage, which gives people a fresh feeling. Thirdly, the book uses new methods and new angles for comparison and analysis. The author insists on using the method of historical materialism to reveal the formation and development of various major religions, while also paying attention to the use of various new methods. For example, based on the research of comparative mythology and comparative linguistics, the origin of Zoroastrianism is discussed; using comparative folklore and comparative religious history, the evolution of ancient Egyptian religion and its relationship with other religions are studied; from the perspective of cultural history, the cultural exchanges between ancient West Asia and the eastern Mediterranean are discussed, deepening the study of Jewish classics.

"The World's Ten Major Religions" is rich in content. Overall, the book not only includes the world's three major religions that people often see, but also includes Shintoism, Sikhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Brahmanism, Zoroastrianism, and other religions that are less discussed in China. In terms of specific research, the author clearly presents the origin, development, evolution, main doctrines, and ideas of each religion in an orderly manner, and also provides a comprehensive introduction to the main scriptures, sectarian organizations, sacrificial beliefs, rituals, and major relics, holy sites, and festivals of various major religions, enabling people to have a complete understanding of these religions. In terms of content arrangement, the author arranges the religions in a certain order of time and region, and relatively concentrates on those with close relationships, for example, Hinduism developed on the basis of Brahmanism, absorbing factors from Buddhism, Jainism, etc., while Sikhism is a product of the combination of Hinduism and Islam. In this way, arranging these few religions in sequence is more helpful for readers to understand the relationships between various religions and their respective characteristics, and to grasp the development of world religions as a whole. Since the whole book not only has a vertical historical narrative of each religion, but also a horizontal comparison, and discusses the relationship between religion and philosophy, science and technology, culture and art, and even social customs, it is also a useful reference book for people to study culture.

This book is a scholarly work on religious studies with a relatively high academic level. Even the preface at the beginning of the book, from the definition of religion to the periodization of human religious history, from the emergence of primitive religion to the formation of world religions, from the relationship between religion and social history to the new developments of various major religions today, has made profound expositions, showing the author's profound knowledge and the result of long-term accumulation and in-depth research. Since the authors of this book are all experts in their respective fields, they have accumulated many years of research and have many profound insights. For example, the author discusses from the perspective of cultural history the great contributions and influences of the Israeli nation on world civilization; believes that the polytheistic worship of Hinduism is essentially monotheistic; the establishment of the Brahmo Samaj "New Theism" integrates the contents of Hinduism, Christianity, Islam, and Chinese Confucianism; Hinduism's Tantrism has had a connection with Chinese Taoism; after Hinduism's yoga was introduced into China, it had exchanges with China's Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, medicine, martial arts, and folk qigong; the formation of Christianity was influenced by Eastern theology, especially Indian Brahmanism; the mutual penetration and promotion between religion and science; etc. When evaluating an idea or a historical event, the author tries to be objective and comprehensive. For example, in the analysis and evaluation of the intention and objective effect of Jesus' social ideal, the positive and negative effects of modern Christian missionary activities, the different characteristics and social functions of Christianity in different times and spaces, the reasonable factors and positive significance as well as the limitations of Jainism, etc., all reflect the author's scientific attitude.

As a systematic monograph on various major world religions, the book also has some shortcomings. For example, the book includes the major religions of the world but omits Taoism in China, which is indeed a regrettable oversight. Due to different sources, some data may have discrepancies. For example, regarding the proportion of Hindus in the world's population, the book has different statements; the number of countries and regions where religious believers are distributed worldwide also has inconsistent figures in the front and back. These seem to be avoidable.

    读《世界十大宗教》
    洪修平
    宗教作为一种重要的文化历史现象，在两个文明的建设中是不容忽视的。党的十一届三中全会以来，宗教研究呈现出空前活跃的局面。近年来，除了专论、专刊与专著的不断出现之外，系列丛书也正在推出，黄心川主编的《世界十大宗教》一书，对我国宗教问题的研究将产生一定的推动作用。
    该书首先体现在它的开拓性。翻开目录，我们发现许多在国内比较缺乏研究的宗教，例如印度教、锡克教，在书中都列有专章，作了系统而全面的研究与介绍，从而填补了国内这方面研究的空白。作者在介绍世界各大宗教历史的同时，特别加强了对当前发展趋势与特点的研究，并充分注意到了世界各大宗教与中国的关系，探究世界宗教在中国的发展及其对中国的社会文化所发生的影响。作者努力从宗教与文化进步、宗教与社会发展的复杂关系中去研究宗教，不断开拓新的研究领域。其次，该书的一个特色还体现在它的观点新颖上。在叙述各大宗教的发展演变与思想特点时，作者并没有停留在一般的介绍和现成的结论上，而是勇于探索，提出了不少新见解。例如在谈到犹太教与世界文化的关系时，作者强调了基督教、伊斯兰教与犹太教的历史渊源，指出了西欧文艺复兴的思想来自阿拉伯人和犹太人，特别是犹太人在介绍阿拉伯的希腊文化遗产中所起的作用，给人以耳目一新之感。再次，该书运用新的方法与新的角度进行比较和分析。作者坚持以历史唯物主义的方法去揭示各大宗教的形成和发展，同时也注意运用各种新方法。例如根据比较神话学与比较语言学的研究，探讨了琐罗亚斯德教的起源；运用比较民俗学、比较宗教史学等方法，研究了古代埃及宗教的演变及其与其它宗教的关系；从文化史的角度，探讨了古代西亚与地中海东部各民族间的文化交流，深化了对犹太经典的研究。
    《世界十大宗教》一书内容丰富。从总体上看，书中不仅有人们常见的世界三大宗教，而且还包括了神道教、锡克教、耆那教、印度教、婆罗门教、琐罗亚斯德教等国内较少论及的宗教。从具体研究来看，作者不仅条分缕析地将各个宗教的起源、发展、演变、主要教义与思想清晰地呈现在人们面前，而且还对各大宗教的主要经典文献、教派组织、祭祀信仰、教规礼仪以及主要的古迹、圣地与节日等等，作了全面的介绍，使人们对这些宗教能有一个完整的了解。从内容编排上看，作者按照一定的时间与区域顺序，对于关系密切的宗教则又相对集中，例如印度教是在婆罗门教的基础上吸收了佛教、耆那教等因素发展起来的，而锡克教又是印度教与伊斯兰教结合的产物。这样，把这几个宗教顺序排列，更有助于读者了解各个宗教之间的关系及其各自的特点，并进而在总体上把握世界宗教的发展。由于全书对各个宗教不仅有纵向的历史叙述，又有横向的比较，并论及了宗教与哲学思想、科学技术、文化艺术乃至社会习俗等多方面的关系，因此，它也是人们研究文化的有用参考书。
    该书是一部学术水平较高的宗教研究专著。就以冠之于全书之首的序而言，从宗教的定义到人类宗教史的分期，从原始宗教的产生到世界性宗教的形成，从宗教与社会历史的关系到当代各大宗教的新发展，作了精辟的阐述，显示了作者的深厚功力，是作者长期的知识积累与深入研究的结果。由于本书的撰稿者都是各个领域的专家，积多年研究之心得，不乏真知灼见。例如作者从文化史的角度谈到以色列民族对世界文明的重大贡献与影响；认为印度教的多神崇拜实质上是一神论；梵社“新天道”的创立综合了印度教、基督教、伊斯兰教和中国儒家学说等内容；印度教的密教与中国道教有过因缘；印度教的瑜伽术传入我国后与我国的佛教、道教、儒教、医学、武术、民间的气功术都有过交流；基督教的形成受到了东方神学、特别是印度婆罗门教的影响；宗教与科学之间的相互渗透、相互促进；等等。在评价一种思想或一个历史事件时，作者尽可能做到客观、全面。例如对于耶酥社会理想的立意与客观作用、对于近代基督教传教活动的正负作用、对于基督教在不同的时空中呈现的不同特点及其不同的社会作用，对于耆那教义中的合理因素与积极意义及其局限性等的分析与评价，无不体现出作者的科学态度。
    作为一部系统论述世界各大宗教的专著，该书也存在着一些不足之处。如书中收录了世界上主要的各大宗教，却遗漏了中国的道教，这实在是一个不应有的缺憾。由于资料来源的不同，有些数据可能会有差异。例如，关于印度教徒占世界人口的比例，书中出现了不同的说法；全世界宗教徒分布在多少国家与地区，前后数字也有不相应之处。这些似乎都是应该避免的。
