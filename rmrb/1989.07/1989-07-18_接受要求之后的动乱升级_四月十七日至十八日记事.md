Some kind-hearted people still believe that if the government had accepted the students' petitions earlier, engaged in dialogue with them earlier, and made concessions to them earlier, there would not have been turmoil and riots.

However, the facts tell us that no matter how restrained and tolerant the government is, a small number of people will always escalate the turmoil.

On April 18, Wang Dan and others first demanded a dialogue with the responsible officials of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and subsequently incited students to storm Zhongnanhai for the first time, which illustrates this point.

On April 15, Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away. The general public and students mourned Comrade Hu Yaobang deeply. However, the mourning activities also showed obvious abnormalities. On April 16, an article in the Hong Kong Ming Pao Daily reported: "The nature of the couplets and big-character posters has gradually shifted from personal mourning to political issues, demanding democracy and criticizing those in power for political reforms. The slogans have become more numerous, and the thoughts of mourning have turned into anger overnight."

On April 17, the first page of the People's Daily featured a photo of the crowd placing wreaths at the Monument to the People's Heroes. A reporter from Kyodo News Agency in Japan commented that the People's Daily's action "indicates that the Party acknowledges this practice." Many students also thought so.

On this day, the first group to enter Tiananmen Square was a contingent of nearly 500 students from the China University of Political Science and Law. The students said they came after seeing the photo in the People's Daily.

Wang Dan and others from Peking University also brought wreaths to Tiananmen Square. By nightfall, Wang Dan had rallied nearly a thousand students to Tiananmen Square at the Sanjiao (Triangle) area of Peking University.

In the early hours of April 18, Wang Dan gave a speech at the Monument to the People's Heroes, proposing seven demands that had been previously discussed with Li Shuxian and others. The two most important demands were: first, to re-evaluate the merits and demerits of Comrade Hu Yaobang; second, to completely negate the opposition to bourgeois liberalization and to rehabilitate the citizens who were allegedly wronged in the anti-liberalization campaign. The essence of these two demands was to achieve absolute freedom in China to oppose the Four Cardinal Principles and realize capitalism.

In the morning, the students were incited to the Great Hall of the People, where they demanded to submit a petition to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. The staff who came out to receive them agreed to convey their demands.

At 7:30 AM, Wang Dan asked his classmates to sit down while he went to call Li Shuxian. After returning, Wang Dan said that Li Shuxian told them to continue their efforts and that she would mobilize more than 6,000 students to support them.

At 8:00 AM, officials from the General Office of the Central Committee and the State Council's Letters and Visits Office invited student representatives into the Great Hall of the People to listen to their opinions and demands. Wang Dan and Guo Haifeng (who later served as the secretary-general of the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation") handed the petition to the official from the Letters and Visits Office.

Originally, the matter could have ended there. But Wang Dan and others claimed that this dialogue was unsatisfactory and again demanded that the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress come out for a dialogue.

At 9:30 AM, Li Shuxian posted three small-character posters at the Sanjiao area of Peking University, calling on people to go and support the students at Tiananmen Square.

At 10:30 AM, only about 200-300 students remained in the square, sitting in protest. Wang Dan lowered his demand from the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to a Vice Chairman. The reception staff explained to them that inviting the Chairman to come out required a certain procedure.

At noon, there were only about 100 students left in the square. Wang Dan and others further lowered their demand, saying that even a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress could come out.

At 3:00 PM, a few hundred students from various universities gradually arrived at the square, and Wang Dan began to incite the students to storm the Great Hall of the People.

At 5:00 PM, the reception staff replied to the students that three members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, including Liu Yandong, would have a dialogue with the students.

At this time, the number of students in the square began to increase. Wang Dan and others suddenly changed their demand for a dialogue, insisting that the National People's Congress representatives should publicly accept their petition at 7:50 PM at the first layer of steps outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People. They said that as long as the petition was accepted, everything would be fine.

The relevant leaders agreed to this demand from the students.

At 7:50 PM, Liu Yandong, a member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and National People's Congress representatives Tao Xiping and Song Shixiong accepted the "Ten-Point Protest Demands" and "Seven-Point Demands" petitions from Guo Haifeng and Li Jingjin (who later served as the legal advisor to the "Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation"). More than a dozen foreign reporters had already set up their cameras.

Accepting the petition, would everything really be fine?

No. Three hours later, more than 2,000 people stormed the Zhongnanhai gate. They gathered in front of Zhongnanhai, blocking traffic on Chang'an Avenue. They injured the security soldiers who were maintaining order, shouting "Li Peng, come out!" and charging at Zhongnanhai every half hour. Notably, someone in the crowd (claiming to be a Peking University student) even held up a banner with the word "Hunger Strike." At this time, Wang Dan was standing to the side, laughing with two female students, watching the spectacle.

At 4:20 AM on April 19, the municipal government broadcast a notice at the scene, pointing out that storming party and government agencies was illegal and that this was no longer a normal mourning activity. It required the crowd to leave the scene.

When the staff and on-duty police appeared, Wang Dan was the first to slip away.

At around 5:00 AM, under the persuasion and guidance of the staff and on-duty police, the crowd gathered in front of Zhongnanhai gradually dispersed.

Why did Wang Dan and others, after submitting the petition, demand a dialogue? After the relevant authorities agreed to a dialogue, why did they then demand that the petition be publicly accepted? This demand was met, so why did they then storm Zhongnanhai?

Look at the materials exposed by a Peking University student afterward:

"On April 19, when I was chatting with a few other classmates about our actions at Tiananmen and in front of Zhongnanhai with great excitement, a person who was not in our class but was a key figure in the action (Wang Dan) said, 'The most emotional thing in front of Zhongnanhai is to provoke the police to start a fire. As long as the police are helpless and take action, we have an excuse to escalate the matter.' I asked, 'So you intentionally let the police beat us?' He said, 'You can't put it that way, but this is how you rally students.

I see, my heart sank. I participated in this great movement with the intention of sacrificing for democracy, but I never thought that someone would use me.

Experience tells me that conspirators always create conflicts in this way, and then reap the benefits. Now I have one in my midst!"

This student and many other kind-hearted people may not have realized at the time that this was just the beginning. Later, similar, or even more malicious, conspiracies and deceptions would repeatedly appear in this turmoil. A small number of plotters would not stop until the turmoil escalated, and they had already made up their minds.

    接受要求之后的动乱升级
    ——四月十七日至十八日记事
    任玉清
    一些善良的人至今还认为，政府如果早点接受学生的请愿，早点与学生对话，早点对学生让步，就不至于发生动乱和暴乱。
    但是，事实告诉我们，无论政府怎样克制和容忍，极少数人总要将动乱升级。
    4月18日，王丹等人首次要求同全国人大常委会负责同志对话，继而煽动学生首次冲击中南海的行动就说明了这一点。
    4月15日，胡耀邦同志逝世。广大群众和学生沉痛悼念胡耀邦同志。但是悼念活动也出现了明显的异常现象。4月16日香港《明报》的一篇报道说：“挽联和大字报的性质已经渐渐从个人哀悼转为政治化，要求民主、批评当权者的政治改革。口号越来越多，哀悼之思，一夜之间转化为气愤之情。”
    4月17日，《人民日报》第一版刊登一幅群众在纪念碑前围着花圈的照片。日本共同社记者称，《人民日报》这一行动“表示党承认这种做法。”许多学生也正是这样认为。
    这天，第一支进入天安门广场的是中国政法大学近500人的队伍，学生们说，他们是看了《人民日报》的照片以后来的。
    北大王丹等人也将花圈送到了天安门广场。到了夜里，王丹又在北大三角地鼓动了近千名学生去天安门广场。
    18日凌晨，王丹在纪念碑前演讲，提出了事先与李淑娴等人商议过的7条要求，其中最主要的是两条：一是，重新评价胡耀邦同志的是非功过；二是，彻底否定反对资产阶级自由化，为反自由化中所谓“蒙受不白之冤的公民”平反昭雪。这两条的实质，就是要在中国取得反对四项基本原则，实现资本主义化的绝对自由。
    清晨，学生们被鼓动到人民大会堂前，提出向人大常委会递交请愿书。出来接待的工作人员答应负责转达他们的要求。
    7时30分，王丹让同学们坐下，自己去给李淑娴打电话。王丹回来后说，李老师让我们继续坚持，她将动员6000多学生来声援我们。
    8时，中央办公厅、国务院信访局负责同志邀请学生代表进入人民大会堂，听取他们的意见和要求。王丹、郭海峰（后来担任“高自联”秘书长），将请愿书交给信访局负责同志。
    本来事情已经可以结束。但王丹等又称这次对话不能令人满意，又要求人大常委会委员长出来对话。
    9时30分，李淑娴在北大三角地贴出三张小字报，号召人们前去声援天安门广场的学生。
    10时30分，坚持在广场静坐的只剩下二三百人。王丹将让人大常委会委员长出来对话的要求，降为让副委员长出面。接待人员向他们解释，请委员长们出面要有一定程序。
    中午，广场上的学生只剩下100多人。王丹等人又降低了要求，说让人大常委会委员出来也可以。
    下午3时，部分高校的几百名学生陆续到达广场，王丹开始煽动学生冲击人民大会堂。
    下午5时，接待人员答复学生，人大常委会委员刘延东等3人将与学生座谈。
    这时，广场上的学生陆续增多，王丹等人突然提出不对话了，要求人大代表在晚7时50分在人大会堂东门外第一层台阶上当众接他们的请愿书。并说，只要接了请愿书就什么事也没有了。
    有关领导又同意了学生的这一要求。
    晚7时50分，人大常委委员刘延东，人大代表陶西平、宋世雄在人大会堂东门外从郭海峰、李京津（后来担任“工自联”法律顾问）二人手里接过了“十点示威要求”和“七点要求”的请愿书。十多位外国记者早已对准了摄像机镜头。
    接下请愿书，果真就什么事都没有了吗？
    不。3个小时之后，马上就发生了2000多人冲击新华门的事件。他们围聚新华门前，堵塞了长安街的交通。他们打伤了维持秩序的警卫战士，呼喊着：“李鹏出来”，每隔半小时冲一次新华门。值得注意的是，人群中有人（自称是北大学生）竟打着写有“绝食”二字的横幅。而此时，王丹却嘻笑着与两个女同学站在一边看热闹。
    19日凌晨4时20分，市政府在现场广播了通告，指出冲击党政机关是违法的，是法制不能允许的，这已不是正常的悼念活动。要求在场的人群离开现场。
    当工作人员和值勤武警一出现，王丹第一个溜掉了。
    清晨5时许，在工作人员和值勤武警的劝说和疏导下，围聚在新华门前的人逐渐散去。
    为什么王丹等人递交了请愿书后，又提出对话？有关方面答应对话后，他们又要求当众接请愿书？这一要求满足了，他们为什么又去冲中南海？
    请看北大一学生事后揭发的材料：
    “4月19日，当我怀着兴奋的心情与另外几个同学聊我们在天安门和新华门前的行动时，一位不是我们班，但是行动的中坚人物（王丹）说，新华门前最来情绪的就是拱起警察的火，只要警察无奈，一动手，我们就有借口把事情扩大。我问，那你们是有意让警察打我们了？他说：话不能这么说，但这样才能号召同学。
    原来如此，我心一抽。我是怀着为民主献身愿望参加这一伟大运动的，没想到有人竟利用我。
    经验告诉我，阴谋家制造冲突都是这一着，而坐收渔人之利，而今我身边也有！”
    这位同学和更多善良的人们当时也许没有想到，这还仅仅是开始。以后，类似的，或者说是更恶劣的阴谋、欺骗，在这场风波中还将一再出现，极少数策划者非使动乱不断升级不可，他们早已下了决心。
