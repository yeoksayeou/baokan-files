The 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championships entered its third day of competition. Thirteen boxers, including the 19-year-old Chinese 91-kilogram boxer Bai Chongguang, advanced to the semifinals in five weight classes after intense battles.

In tonight's matches, boxers from various countries showcased different technical styles, engaging in fierce contests. Most matches went the full three rounds, and by the time the referee announced the winner, both boxers were drenched in sweat.

Due to financial constraints, Syria sent only two boxers to this Asian boxing event. Tonight, both showed excellent performances, particularly Kangji in the 63.5-kilogram class. His agile footwork and clear punches, combined with lightning-fast combinations, left the audience spellbound. His punches were accurate and rarely missed. On the first day, he easily eliminated South Korea's Kim Kije, and tonight he defeated Thailand's strongman Yeprayan. Experts consider him a strong contender for the gold medal in his weight class.

The Mongolian boxers, trained by Soviet coaches, are known for their powerful punches. Tonight, both of their competitors, Dember in the 51-kilogram class and Enkebat in the 63-kilogram class, emerged victorious.

China's team, aiming to make an impact in the heavier weight classes, had the opportunity to demonstrate their resolve tonight. In the 75-kilogram match, the newcomer Liu Xinjun from Anhui knocked down his South Korean opponent, Jeong Donghwan, with a straight right punch in the first round. Unfortunately, due to lack of experience, he failed to capitalize on the second opportunity, allowing Jeong to stabilize and ultimately win on points. However, the young Chinese boxer Bai Chongguang, who competed afterward in the 91-kilogram class, learned from Liu's mistake. He maintained his advantage from start to finish, defeating the towering Indian boxer Singh and advancing to the semifinals.

Other winners tonight included: South Korea's Han Kwangyeong and Iraq's Kanim in the 51-kilogram class; India's Padmakar and Japan's Mitsuhiro Miura in the 63-kilogram class; Pakistan's Hassan Shah and India's Gillkar in the 75-kilogram class; and India's Japal Singh in the over-91-kilogram class.

    亚洲拳击锦标赛进入第三天
    中国选手白崇光闯入半决赛
    本报北京7月25日讯　记者缪鲁报道：在第十四届亚洲业余拳击锦标赛第三天角逐中，先后有13名拳手经过苦战，分别闯入五个级别的半决赛，其中包括年仅19岁的中国91公斤级选手白崇光。
    在今晚的比赛中，各国选手展示了不同的技术风格，相互间争斗得十分激烈，多数场次打满了三局，当裁判员宣布比赛胜负时，他两边的拳手无不是汗流浃背。
    因经费紧张，叙利亚仅派出两名拳手参加本届亚洲拳坛盛会，在今晚的比赛中，他俩均有出色表演，尤其是63.5公斤级的坎吉，步伐灵活，拳路清晰，其闪电般的组合拳尽管令观众眼花缭乱，但落点准确，很少落空。在第一天的比赛中，他就干净利落地淘汰了南朝鲜虎将金基泽，今晚他又将抗击打能力颇强的泰国名将耶普雷扬打下台来。被行家们视为夺取该级别金牌的热门人物。
    由苏联教练带出来的蒙古拳手，则以拳力凶猛见长，今晚该队出阵的两名选手51公斤级的德姆伯尔和63公斤级的恩克巴特双双告捷。
    力争在大级别上有所作为的中国队，今晚有机会向人们显示了自己的决心。在75公斤级较量中，来自安徽的新秀刘新军在第一个回合，便以一记后手直拳将他的对手、南朝鲜的郑东焕击倒在地，可惜因经验不足，未能抓住第二次机会，置对手于死地，被慢慢稳住阵脚的郑东焕拖到终场，反以点数告负。不过，在他后面上阵的91公斤级中国小将白崇光显然吸取了他的教训，避免重蹈覆辙，把优势从头保持到结束，击败了长得黑塔般的印度选手辛格，跻身半决赛圈。
    今晚其他几位获胜者是：51公斤级南朝鲜的韩光迥、伊拉克的卡尼姆；63公斤级印度的帕德马卡尔、日本的三浦国宏；75公斤级巴基斯坦的哈桑沙、印度的吉勒卡尔和91公斤以上级印度的贾帕尔辛格。
