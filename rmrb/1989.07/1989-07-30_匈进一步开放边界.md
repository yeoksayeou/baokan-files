Hungary has further opened its western border.

According to reports from Hungarian newspapers today, starting from August 1, Hungary will abolish the border isolation zone and the border buffer zone, which prevent illegal border crossings, that are set up along the Hungarian-Austrian border. This means that Hungary's western border with Austria will be completely open, and citizens can freely enter and exit as long as they have a passport.

The Hungarian-Austrian border stretches 350 kilometers and has been part of the Warsaw Pact's frontline defense against NATO. It has always been heavily fortified. With increasing openness to the West, Hungary has begun dismantling the 260-kilometer-long electronic alarm system set up along the Hungarian-Austrian border since May 2. Currently, 117 kilometers have been dismantled, with plans to complete the dismantling by the end of next year.

    匈进一步开放边界
    新华社布达佩斯7月29日电　（记者侯凤菁）匈牙利进一步开放西部边界。
    据匈牙利报纸今天报道，从8月1日起，匈牙利将取消设在匈奥边境上未经特别准许不能进入的边境隔离带和防止非法越境的边界松土带。这样，匈牙利与奥地利接壤的西部边界便完全开放，公民只要持护照就可以自由出入。
    匈奥边界全长350公里，是华约抵御北约前沿阵地的一部分，历来设防严密。随着对西方更加开放，匈牙利从5月2日起已开始拆除设在匈、奥边境上的260公里长的电子报警系统，目前已拆掉117公里，计划到明年年底全部拆完。
