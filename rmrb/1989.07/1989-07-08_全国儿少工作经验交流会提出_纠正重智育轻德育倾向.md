The national conference on the experience exchange of advanced cities and counties in youth work, which concluded today in Harbin, proposed that at various levels of youth work departments, while cultivating children and adolescents, it is necessary to seriously correct the tendency of emphasizing intellectual education over moral education and to adhere to the correct political direction.

The delegates at the conference fully affirmed the experience of the national model school for moral education reform—Harbin Normal University Affiliated Primary School. This school, based on the age characteristics of students, proposes different requirements for different grades. Through various methods such as exemplary demonstrations, emotional cultivation, educational activities, and moral evaluations, it educates students to love the Party, love the motherland, and love the people's army. Over the years, this school has fostered a good tradition where everyone thinks of others and strives to be a civilized youth.

Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Chairman of the National Committee on Children and Youth Work, Kang Keqing, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the All-China Women's Federation, Chen Mu Hua, both sent congratulatory messages to the conference. In her message, Kang Keqing called for making scientific child-rearing and educating children for the country a conscious action of the entire people, and striving to cultivate a new generation of socialist modernizers.

    全国儿少工作经验交流会提出
    纠正重智育轻德育倾向
    据新华社哈尔滨7月7日电　（实习生李洪伟）今天在哈尔滨闭幕的全国首次儿童少年工作先进市（县）经验交流会提出：各级儿少工作部门在培育儿童少年过程中，必须认真纠正那种重智育轻德育的倾向，坚持正确的政治方向。
    与会代表充分肯定了全国德育整体改革试点校——哈尔滨市师范附小的经验。这所学校根据学生年龄特点，按不同年级提出不同的要求，通过榜样示范、情感陶冶、活动寓教、品德评价等多种方式，对学生进行热爱党、热爱祖国、热爱人民军队的教育。几年来，这所学校已形成处处为他人着想，人人争当文明少年的好风尚。
    全国政协副主席、全国儿少委主任康克清，全国人大常委会副委员长、全国妇联主席陈慕华分别向大会发来贺信。康克清在信中要求把科学育儿、为国教子变成全体人民的自觉行动，努力培养社会主义现代化的一代新人。
