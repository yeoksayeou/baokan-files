Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 2nd.

	The People's Daily, Beijing, July 2nd — Reporters Wu Changsheng and Xinhua News Agency reporter Pu Liyue report: Some units and individuals in impoverished areas such as Inner Mongolia's Tokto County and Henan's Xin County have recently been severely punished by relevant departments for embezzling, misappropriating, withholding, or privately dividing poverty alleviation funds, or for selling poverty alleviation materials. A responsible comrade from the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas said: Such corrupt practices still occur from time to time, and all regions must take more effective measures to resolutely punish and stop them.

	In accordance with the State Council's opinion to resolutely curb corruption in poverty alleviation work, since last year, the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Supervision, and the National Audit Office have swiftly deployed a comprehensive, strict, and in-depth investigation into the use of poverty alleviation funds and materials. Various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as relevant prefectures and counties, have also seriously dealt with illegal and disorderly incidents in poverty alleviation and development. Three prominent cases that have been handled are:

	Inner Mongolia's Tokto County, a key national poverty-stricken county, received a total of 13.17 million yuan in agricultural and poverty alleviation funds from higher authorities from 1984 to 1987. An audit revealed 1.35 million yuan in disciplinary violations, accounting for 10.28%. Of this amount, 1.184 million yuan was misappropriated and squandered, mainly used for building houses, buying cars, entertaining, issuing bonuses, and welfare expenditures. A small number of cadres also embezzled 18.23 million yuan. Relevant departments have dismissed two officials, including the county financial bureau chief, from their administrative positions, given administrative demerits or reprimands to eight individuals, including the water and electricity bureau chief, expelled the former deputy director of the environmental protection bureau from the party, and required the former county party secretary and county magistrate to submit written self-criticisms. The misappropriated and embezzled funds and materials must be returned within a specified period.

	In Guizhou Province, 37 township and village cadres from Xingren and Yinjian counties, along with some of their relatives and friends, intercepted and embezzled 48,000 yuan in poverty alleviation interest-free loans for pig farming and taro development over the past two years. The county party committees and governments of the two counties have given serious party warnings to one deputy township head and one township party committee deputy secretary for their serious errors, and party warnings to one town party committee secretary and one township party committee deputy secretary. All embezzled interest-free loans must be recovered.

	In Henan Province's Xin County, 100 poverty alleviation vehicles were ordered last year, but 45 were resold, yielding an illegal profit of 52,600 yuan. The vehicles sold within the county also had an additional 38,500 yuan in overcharged fees, totaling 91,000 yuan in illegal gains. The Xin County Party Committee decided to give administrative penalties to several leading cadres who made serious mistakes and publicly criticize them. All illegal income has been handed over to the county finance department for use in poverty alleviation.

    用于扶贫钱物岂容贪污挪用  三起突出案件责任者受惩处
    本报北京7月2日讯　本报记者吴长生、新华社记者蒲立业报道：内蒙古托克托县、河南新县等贫困地区的一些单位和个人，因贪污、挪用、截留、私分扶贫资金或倒卖扶贫物资，最近受到有关部门的严肃处理。国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组一位负责同志说：这类腐败现象目前仍时有发生，各地必须采取更有力措施坚决惩办、制止。
    根据国务院要坚决制止扶贫工作中的腐败现象的意见，自去年以来，国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组、财政部、监察部、审计署等单位迅即联合部署对扶贫资金、物资的使用情况进行了一次全面、严格、深入的调查。各省、市、自治区及有关地、县也分别对扶贫开发方面违法乱纪的事件进行了严肃处理。现已查处的3个突出案件是：
    属于全国重点贫困县的内蒙古托克托县，从1984年到1987年共得到上级拨给的支农和扶贫款1317万元，经审计发现违纪金额135万元，占10.28％。其中挪用、挥霍118.4万元，主要用于盖房买车、吃喝招待、发放奖金和福利支出等，还有少数干部侵占18.23万元。有关部门已将犯有严重错误的县财政局长等二人撤销行政职务，将水电局长等8人行政记大过或记过，将原环保所副所长开除党籍，原县委书记、县长作书面检查；挪用、侵占的资金、物资限期收回。
    贵州省兴仁、印江两县的37名区、乡干部以及他们的一部分亲朋好友，近两年截留侵占用于发展养猪、芭蕉芋的扶贫贴息贷款共4.8万元。两县县委、县政府已给予错误严重的1名副区长和1名乡党委副书记党内严重警告处分，1名镇党委书记、1名乡党委副书记党内警告处分，所有侵占的贴息贷款一律追回。
    河南省新县去年订购扶贫汽车100辆，转手倒卖45辆，从中牟利5.26万多元，在本县销售的汽车又超收费用3.85万多元，非法所得共9.1万多元。新县县委决定给予几个犯有严重错误的领导干部以行政处分，并通报批评。非法所得收入全部上交县财政，用于扶贫。
