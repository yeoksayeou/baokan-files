Within the boundaries of Datong Hui and Tu Autonomous County in Qinghai Province, there stands a mountain named Mount Niangniang, with an elevation of over 4,000 meters and a total area of more than 100 square kilometers. Though it does not rival the grandeur of Tanggula Mountain on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, it is renowned for its serene and exquisite beauty, possessing a unique charm.

Mount Niangniang is a branch of the Qilian Mountains, famous for its picturesque scenery. From the foothills to the peak, the landscape changes with the seasons, presenting a kaleidoscope of colors. It is like a natural gallery, deep and tranquil, vibrant and diverse. Starting from Miaogou in Datong New Town, following a small stream, the journey leads deeper into the mountains. The deeper you go, the denser the forest becomes, and the more secluded the scenery. After a few miles, you reach the foot of Mount Niangniang. Here, mountains surround you on three sides, peaks touch the clouds, cliffs stand opposite each other, and layers of hills stack upon one another. Birch trees interspersed with pine and poplar trees rise majestically, each with its own unique character. If you are inclined, you can ascend via the winding, narrow paths. The vast birch forests and grassy hills stretch out in undulating waves, interspersed with dense forests and steep cliffs, giving a sense of "mountains and waters intertwining, doubting there is a path." But as you continue to explore, the path suddenly turns, and you feel a sense of "clouds parting to reveal another sky." Standing at the summit, you can see the high-rise buildings of Xining City to the south, and the towering cliffs of Dashan Mountain to the north, rugged and majestic. Looking around, you see rolling hills, misty clouds, and ever-changing scenery. It seems both earthly and ethereal, with only the sounds of water and birds, devoid of the noise of vehicles and horses. The tranquility and serenity here can dispel all fatigue.

Originally named Falling Cloud Mountain, Mount Niangniang got its name from a beautiful legend. It is said that during the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty, he led an expedition against the Tuyuhun, accompanied by his primary consort. Emperor Yang's troops burned, killed, and plundered as they marched, causing great suffering to the people. When they reached the territory of Datong County, the beautiful, upright, and kind primary consort saw that the land was beautiful, the local customs were pure, and the people of various ethnic groups were hardworking and simple. Men tilled the fields and women wove, with both farming and herding, though life was hard, they lived in harmony. Unable to bear the sight, she bravely advised the emperor to withdraw his troops. Enraged, Emperor Yang immediately demoted her to a commoner and banished her to Falling Cloud Mountain to herd sheep. In protest against the tyrant, she jumped off a cliff to her death. To commemorate this upright and kind woman, people built a temple at the foot of Falling Cloud Mountain, where incense burns year-round.

The serene and exquisite scenery, combined with the beautiful legend, makes Mount Niangniang a mountain that people on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau long to visit. The rich treasures both above and below the ground, such as coal, quartz, and various precious medicinal herbs, have already begun to benefit the people of various ethnic groups here.

    娘娘山
    陈德宝
    青海省大通回族土族自治县境内，有一座海拔4000余米、总面积100多平方公里的山——娘娘山。在青藏高原，它虽不及唐古拉山那般高大雄奇，却幽深秀绝，别有风姿。
    娘娘山是祁连山系的支脉，素以风光旖旎著称。从山麓到顶峰，一年四季奇景变幻，色彩缤纷，宛如一条幽深静雅、绚丽多姿的天然画廊。从大通新城乡的庙沟，由一条小溪引导着向前走。愈走，山愈深，林愈密，景愈幽。行若数里，就到了娘娘山脚下。这里三面环山，高峰入云，峭壁对峙，层峦叠嶂，桦林间杂着苍松和白杨，负势竞上，各具情态。如果你有兴致，可以沿迂回曲折的羊肠小道攀援而上。那万亩桦林和草山，逶迤起伏，错落其间，时有茂林如屏，峭壁当面，使人有“山重水复疑无路”之感。但当你继续探幽时，又很快峰回路转，顿生“云开别有天”的情趣。登临绝顶，南面西宁市区的高楼大厦隐约可见，北面的大坂山壁立万仞，雄奇险峻。目及四周，但见岗陵起伏，雾岚飘渺，气象万千，说是人间，又似仙境，只闻水声鸟语，没有车马喧嚣，那幽，那静，使人消了劳顿。
    娘娘山原名落云山，因了一个美丽的传说而得名。相传隋炀帝当年出兵亲征吐谷浑，由正宫娘娘伴驾作陪。隋炀帝带兵一路烧杀抢掠，到处峰烟四起，百姓苦不堪言。来到大通县境时，美丽、正直而又善良的正宫娘娘见这里山川秀美，民风淳正，各族人民勤劳朴实，男耕女织，有农有牧，虽度日艰难，却也相安相和，再也顾不得个人安危，冒死进谏，劝隋炀帝退兵。隋炀帝不觉大怒，立即传旨，贬娘娘为庶人，发配落云山中放马牧羊。娘娘为了表示对暴君的愤慨，毅然跳崖身亡。人们为永久纪念这位正直善良的女人，在落云山麓建起娘娘庙，一年四季香火不灭。
    幽深秀绝的风光加之美丽动人的传说，使娘娘山成了青藏高原上人们神往的一座山。而山中地上地下的丰富宝藏，如煤、石英石、各种名贵中草药，也已经开始为这里的各族人民造福。
