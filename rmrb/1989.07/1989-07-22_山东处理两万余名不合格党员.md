    Shandong Deals with Over 20,000 Unqualified Party Members
    People's Daily reports: Shandong Province's party organizations have adhered to the principle of strict party governance, universally conducting democratic evaluations of party members and handling unqualified party members. So far, a total of 24,375 unqualified party members have been dealt with, of which 5,233 have been expelled from the party.

    To effectively carry out the democratic evaluation of party members and handle unqualified party members, the provincial party committee made meticulous arrangements. The entire province dispatched over 100,000 cadres to the grassroots level to provide specific assistance in implementation. The "five transparencies" of investigation and survey, democratic evaluation, opinion identification, problem investigation, and organizational handling were implemented, and many difficult problems were resolved. The over 5,000 unqualified party members expelled from the party across the province were mostly convinced and accepted the decision.

    The democratic evaluation of party members and the handling of unqualified party members have deeply educated the broad masses of party members. The problems of weakness, dispersion, and disorder in grassroots party organizations have been significantly improved, enhancing the party's combat effectiveness and attractiveness. According to statistics from Yantai and Weifang, over 13,600 people have recently applied to join the party.

    为了做好民主评议党员、处理不合格党员的工作，省委作了周密部署。全省抽调10万多名干部到基层，具体帮助实施。实行调查摸底、民主评议、鉴定意见、查核问题、组织处理“五个透明”，许多棘手问题迎刃而解。全省被清除出党的5000多名不合格党员，绝大多数心服口服。
    民主评议党员、处理不合格党员，使广大党员受到了深刻教育。基层党组织软、散、乱问题得到了较好的解决，增强了党的战斗力和吸引力。据烟台、潍坊两市统计，有13600多人新近提出入党申请。
