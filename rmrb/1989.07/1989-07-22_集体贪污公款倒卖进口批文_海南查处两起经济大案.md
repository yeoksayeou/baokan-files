    At a provincial anti-corruption work conference held yesterday, Bo Fanguo, Secretary of the Hainan Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, disclosed two major economic crime cases involving party and government officials, a secretary of the provincial government office, and a county discipline inspection commission secretary.

    The first case is the collective embezzlement by the Yingsonghai Saltworks. In October last year and March this year, the Party Committee Secretary of the Yingsonghai Saltworks, Chen Taiye, Deputy Director Gao Kechong, and Sales Department Head Feng Zhiqing, collectively embezzled 110,500 yuan from the proceeds of off-plan coarse salt sales without recording them in the accounts. Among them, Chen Taiye, Gao Kechong, Feng Zhiqing, and Zhu Dequan each received 9,000 yuan, while Wang Junyi received 4,000 yuan. Li Shouming, General Manager of the Provincial Salt Administration (at the deputy minister level), and Fu Mingxin, Manager of the Provincial Salt Administration Sales Company, abused their positions to approve sales quotas and accept bribes. Currently, Chen Taiye, Gao Kechong, Feng Zhiqing, Li Shouming, and Fu Mingxin have been arrested, and two others are under bail pending trial.

    The second case involves the illegal sale of import permits by the Ninghan Company. In August 1988, Huang Jun, Deputy Manager of the Ninghan National Economic Development Company in Wanning County, in collaboration with Wu Qianhui, Manager of the Wanning County Pharmaceutical Company, applied to the provincial government for the import of 20,000 tons of white sugar under the name of the Ninghan Company in Wanning County. After approval by the Wanning County Government, Huang Wenya, a member of the county committee and the county discipline inspection commission secretary, accompanied Huang Jun and Wu Qianhui to seek approval from relevant provincial government leaders. With the assistance of Huang Haofu, a secretary in the Provincial Government Office Secretariat (who is Huang Wenya's son), and Chen Donglong, an employee of the Wanning County Specialty Products Company, they obtained the import permit from the Provincial Department of Commerce and Industry in September of the same year.

    After obtaining the permit, Huang Jun and others, through Lin Dexian, an employee of the Jinhai County Finance and Trade Economic Development Company, negotiated with Liu Lisheng, General Manager of the Jinhai Company, and Luo Xiaoming, Business Manager, to sell the permit to the Jinhai Company at a price of 55 yuan per ton, earning an illegal profit of 11 million yuan. The Ninghan Company and the Pharmaceutical Company each received 3 million yuan.

    The remaining 5 million yuan was divided among Wu Qianhui, Huang Jun, and others through Wu Hongqi, the manager of a financial company branch in Haikou. Wu Hongqi demanded 18,000 yuan for his part. Huang Jun, Deputy Manager of the Ninghan Company in Wanning County, received 17.21 million yuan, Wu Qianhui, Manager of the Wanning County Pharmaceutical Company, received 18.43 million yuan, Lin Dexian, an employee of the Jinhai County Finance and Trade Economic Development Company, received 3.88 million yuan, Chen Donglong, an employee of the Wanning County Specialty Products Company, received 3.88 million yuan, and Huang Haofu, a secretary in the Provincial Government Office Secretariat, received 4.8 million yuan. Huang Jun gave 2 million yuan from his share to Huang Wenya, a member of the Wanning County Committee and the county discipline inspection commission secretary.

    Currently, in this case of illegal sale of import permits, Huang Jun, Wu Qianhui, Chen Donglong, Lin Dexian, who are guilty of speculation and profiteering, and Wu Hongqi, Huang Wenya, and Huang Haofu, who are guilty of bribery, have all been arrested according to law.

    集体贪污公款倒卖进口批文
    海南查处两起经济大案
    据新华社海口7月22日电　（记者陈江、田川）中共海南省纪委书记董范国昨天在全省廉政建设工作会上公布了有党政部门领导干部、省政府办公厅秘书和县纪委书记参与的两起经济犯罪大案。
    一起是莺歌海盐场集体贪污案。去年10月与今年3月，海南省莺歌海盐场党委书记陈泰崖、副场长高克崇、运销科长冯志兴，两次将销售计划外粗盐不入账的货款共11.05万元集体私分，其中陈泰崖、高克崇、冯志兴、朱德泉每人分得9000元，王琼义分得4000元。省盐务总公司总经理李守铭（副厅级）和省盐务总公司运销公司经理符明新利用职务之便，批销售指标，收受贿赂。目前，陈泰崖、高克崇、冯志兴、李守铭、符明新已被逮捕，另有两人被取保候审。
    另一案件是宁汉公司倒卖进口批文案。1988年8月，万宁县宁汉民族经济开发公司副经理黄琼，伙同该县医药总公司经理吴乾辉，以万宁县宁汉公司名义向省政府申请联合进口2万吨白糖，经万宁县政府同意后，由县委常委、县纪委书记黄文雅带黄琼、吴乾辉找省政府有关领导批示，然后送省贸工厅审批。在省政府办公厅秘书处秘书黄好富，即黄文雅的儿子和万宁县土产公司职工陈东龙等人的配合下，于同年9月从省贸工厅取到进口批文。
    批文到手后，黄琼等人通过琼海县财贸经济发展公司干部林德贤，找琼港公司总经理刘丽生、业务经理罗小明商定，以每吨55元的价格将批文倒卖给琼港公司，牟取暴利110万元。宁汉公司和医药总公司各分得30万元。
    余下50万元，经吴乾辉、黄琼等人密谋，通过在海口的一家金融公司营业部经理吴弘起提取现金进行分赃。吴弘起从中索要18000元，万宁县宁汉公司副经理黄琼分得17.21万元，万宁县医药总公司经理吴乾辉分得18.43万元，琼海县财贸经济发展公司干部林德贤分得3.88万元，万宁县土产公司职工陈东龙分得3.88万元，省政府办公厅秘书处秘书黄好富分得4.8万元。黄琼在自己所分得的赃款中送给万宁县委常委、县纪委书记黄文雅2万元。
    目前，在这起倒卖进口批文案件中，构成投机倒把罪的黄琼、吴乾辉、陈东龙、林德贤和犯有受贿罪的吴弘起、黄文雅、黄好富均已被依法逮捕。
