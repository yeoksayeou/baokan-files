    Female Drug Lord

    In recent years, female leaders have emerged within American drug trafficking organizations. These women are highly skilled and pose a significant threat to society. Experts from the U.S. federal anti-drug agency acknowledge that the drug industry in America, like other sectors, is seeing an increasing number of female leaders. In the 1990s, the number of female drug traffickers being prosecuted is expected to rise significantly, nearly matching the number of male drug lords.

    Recently, New York City apprehended a female drug trafficking ringleader named Ulga Lis. Her organization sells 100 kilograms of drugs weekly, valued at $20 million. This petite drug dealer had 21 associates who used the latest technology to obtain drugs along the East Coast of the United States and then distributed them across various regions. Ulga Lis has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Another American female drug trafficker, Aizhenna, specifically recruits women to engage in drug trafficking. Recently, in Pennsylvania, a female drug trafficker named Mary Ann Hahn was busted; her drug network extended as far as Lebanon.

    Drug trafficking and abuse in the United States are becoming increasingly severe, with smuggling and trafficking organizations becoming more powerful. The addition of female leaders has further intensified the situation. The challenges in combating drugs are immense.

    贩毒女头目
    近年来，美国走私贩毒集团里出现了一批女头目。她们手段高强，危害社会严重。美国联邦反毒当局的专家承认，美国的毒品业如同其他行业一样，女头子不断涌现，90年代被检控的毒品走私贩中，女毒犯将大大增多，她们几乎与男性毒枭平分秋色。
    最近，纽约市抓获了一个名叫厄嘉利丝的毒品走私贩卖女头目，她掌握的贩毒集团每星期售出100公斤毒品，价值2000万美元。这个身材矮小的女毒品贩子，手下有21个帮手，他们采用最新技术在美国东海岸地区弄到毒品，然后到各地推销。厄嘉利丝现已被判处终身监禁。另一个美国女毒品贩子爱贞娜，她专门招揽妇女从事贩毒。宾夕法尼亚州最近破获的女毒品贩子玛丽安·哈恩，她的贩毒网络远及黎巴嫩。
    美国贩毒吸毒现象日趋严重，走私贩毒集团神通广大，现在又加进了一帮女头目，气势更大。禁毒工作困难重重。·石宁·
