The nationwide reduction of construction investment and the slowing down of economic growth since last year's second half have led to several million rural laborers, who were working in urban construction and other sectors, returning to their villages. How should we view this issue under the current circumstances? What measures should be taken in the short term and the long term to promote the transfer of surplus agricultural labor force? The authors share their views on these questions.

Currently, China's economy is in a period of rectification and adjustment. Through these measures, the growth rate of industry is appropriately reduced, the industrial structure is adjusted, and inflation is gradually alleviated to promote sustainable and smooth economic development. The key to achieving industrial structural transformation lies in two areas: first, vigorously promoting agricultural development to transition from traditional agriculture to modern agriculture. Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy. Without agricultural development, industrial development will either stagnate or, if it progresses, will lead to serious economic imbalances; second, reducing the excessively high growth rate of industry and changing the investment structure. China's rectification and adjustment started from these aspects.

At present, China's agricultural sector is still weak, but there is a large surplus of labor in the agricultural sector. According to calculations, under current production conditions, the number of laborers needed to maintain land productivity without reduction is 75 million. Even if laborers engaged in forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries are included in the agricultural labor force, there are still at least 100 million surplus laborers in rural areas nationwide. This situation results in a large number of idle and wasted agricultural laborers, which is not conducive to the promotion of modern agricultural technology and the application of modern machinery, thus hindering the progress of agricultural modernization. From another perspective, since most of the primary products produced by agriculture are consumed by the agricultural population, this limits the supply of agricultural products to industries such as manufacturing, constraining their development. Therefore, the existence of a large surplus of labor in agriculture is not only a major obstacle to achieving agricultural modernization but also a practical problem in the rationalization of the industrial structure.

The economic development history of developed countries shows that every country, sooner or later, experiences a process of gradually reducing agricultural labor and increasing non-agricultural labor, which is an objective law of economic development. China will also go through this process.

To achieve the transfer of surplus agricultural labor, it is necessary to first determine the transfer channels. Many countries have faced situations of agricultural labor surplus and urban labor shortage during their economic development. These countries have completed the transfer of surplus agricultural labor to cities, thus accomplishing this task. However, China's reality is that agricultural labor surplus and urban labor surplus coexist. This determines that China's transfer of surplus agricultural labor must take a unique path. In recent years, the transfer channels for China's surplus agricultural labor can be generally summarized into two aspects: first, transferring within rural areas to non-agricultural sectors, mainly through local transfers. In recent years, rural areas have developed rural industries and the tertiary sector, locally arranging a large number of surplus agricultural laborers. According to statistics, by 1987, 80 million agricultural laborers had been transferred to the secondary and tertiary sectors within rural areas, becoming the main channel for agricultural labor transfer; second, transferring to cities. Some service industries and certain manufacturing sectors in cities need to recruit agricultural laborers who can adapt to the labor characteristics of these industries. During the Sixth Five-Year Plan period, an average of nearly one million agricultural laborers were transferred to become urban workers each year, accounting for 13.4% of the total new urban employment during the Sixth Five-Year Plan period. In addition, in recent years, several million rural construction workers have been engaged in various construction activities in cities each year, and some farmers have entered cities to engage in commerce and other service industries.

Currently, China is in a period of rectification and adjustment, and cities cannot continue to absorb a large number of surplus agricultural laborers. Therefore, in the short term, the main transfer channel for surplus agricultural labor can only be to digest it locally within rural areas, and the scale and speed should not be too large. In this transfer process, it is necessary to promptly complete a series of tasks. First, use tax and credit policies to encourage township enterprises to seize the opportunity of rectification and adjustment to actively adjust and optimize their structure, such as producing scarce and popular products, famous and high-quality products, and developing energy, transportation, raw material, and agricultural support industries, so that they can not only improve effective supply but also appropriately absorb surplus agricultural labor. Second, the state's foreign trade departments should increase investment in rural areas to develop small, labor-intensive foreign exchange-earning enterprises, especially to vigorously develop China's traditional handicrafts and weaving, embroidery, and other products that can absorb a large number of laborers. Third, relevant government departments should plan and organize the transfer of surplus agricultural labor. Currently, there are differences in employment opportunities between economically developed and underdeveloped regions in China, which will inevitably lead to the transfer of agricultural labor from economically underdeveloped regions to economically developed regions. This requires relevant departments to organize and manage to avoid social problems caused by the blind transfer of labor.

From a long-term perspective, the scale of surplus agricultural labor transferring to urban industries and other sectors will gradually increase. This will have a significant driving effect on the overall national economy and social development, manifested in the following aspects: first, it can promote the rational flow of social resources, improve resource allocation, and transfer production factors from sectors with lower marginal productivity to sectors with higher marginal productivity, thereby continuously improving the total return of social production; second, in the case of allowing a small number of surplus agricultural laborers to enter cities, through appropriate and reasonable competition, it is beneficial to motivate urban enterprise employees to work diligently and improve labor productivity; third, it can avoid or reduce some adverse effects on economic and social development caused by the transfer of surplus agricultural labor only to rural non-agricultural industries. Cities have three levels: large, medium, and small. The distribution of large cities in China is not reasonable, and it is necessary to plan and develop some medium-sized cities into large cities according to the local situation. For some industrial enterprises that are not suitable to be concentrated in large cities, it is necessary to plan and transfer them to medium and small cities, especially the township industries that have emerged in recent years, some of which also need to be appropriately concentrated in medium and small cities. Currently, the number of medium and small cities in China is far from meeting the above needs, so it is necessary to vigorously develop medium and small cities, including small towns scattered throughout the countryside. The development of medium and small cities can meet the needs of rural industrial agglomeration and urbanization. Therefore, from a medium and long-term perspective, the optimal transfer channel for surplus agricultural labor may be: most of it will be carried by township industries, entering medium-sized, especially small cities, through the agglomeration of township industries, while an appropriate amount of labor will enter large cities to meet the needs of certain industries and sectors.

To achieve the transfer of rural labor, it is necessary to strengthen rural education and improve the quality of farmers. This to a large extent determines their employment scope. Higher cultural level means easier mastery of technology and stronger market utilization ability, thus more employment opportunities; conversely, the employment scope will be very narrow. However, the educational structure must change with the changes in the departmental structure of the national economy; otherwise, even if the total labor force matches the needs of economic growth, the labor force structure will not meet the needs of economic growth. Therefore, it is not only necessary to provide various forms of cultural and technical training for the surplus agricultural labor force that is about to be transferred but also, more importantly, to increase educational investment through various means to strengthen rural basic education, improve the educational structure, and enhance the cultural quality of rural reserve labor force. Only in this way can it be conducive to the transfer of surplus agricultural labor.

    关于农业剩余劳动力转移的思考
    李东明　李耀锋
    去年下半年开始的全国范围内压缩基建投资，降低经济发展速度，使城市内几百万农民建筑工、计划外用工返乡。那么，在当前形势下如何看待这个问题？近期与中长期又如何促进农业剩余劳动力转移？对此笔者略抒己见。
    目前，我国经济发展正处于治理整顿时期。通过治理整顿，适当降低工业增长速度，调整产业结构，逐步缓解和克服通货膨胀，以推动经济持续顺利地发展。而实现产业结构转变的重点应放在两个方面，一是大力推进农业发展，实现由传统农业向现代化农业的转变。农业是国民经济的基础。如果没有农业的发展，工业发展要么上不去，即使上去了也会产生严重的经济失衡；二是降低工业过高的发展速度，改变投资结构。我国的治理整顿就是从这方面开始着手的。
    我国现阶段农业还很薄弱，但农业战线剩余劳动力却为数众多。据测算，在目前生产条件下，保证土地生产率不降低所需劳动力的数量为7500万人，即使把从事林、牧、副、渔业劳动力也算在农业劳动力范围内，全国农村现在至少仍有1亿多剩余劳动力。这种状况造成了大量农业劳动力闲置和浪费，不利于现代农业技
  术推广和现代机械的应用，从而阻碍农业现代化的进程。从另一方面看，由于农业所生产的初级产品大部分被农业人口直接消费掉，这就限制了农业向工业等行业提供更多的农产品，制约着它们的发展。因此，农业中存在大量剩余劳动力不仅是实现农业现代化的一大障碍，也是产业结构合理化面临的一个现实问题。
    发达国家的经济发展史表明，任何国家或先或后地要经历农业劳动力逐步减少，非农产业劳动力逐步增多这样一个劳动力转移过程，这是经济发展的客观规律。我国同样也要经历这一过程。
    实现农业剩余劳动力转移，必须首先确定转移途径。世界上许多国家在经济发展过程中曾经面临农业劳动力过剩、城市劳动力不足的局面。这些国家只要完成农业剩余劳动力向城市的转移，就能实现这一任务。但我国的现实情况是：农业劳动力过剩与城市劳动力过剩同时并存。这决定了我国农业剩余劳动力转移必然走独特的途径。近年来，我国农业剩余劳动力转移途径，大致可以概括为两个方面：一是向农村内部非农业转移，主要是就地转移。前几年农村通过发展农村工业和第三产业等途径，就地安排了大批农业剩余劳动力。据统计，到1987年时全国农业劳动力就地向第二、三产业已转移了8000万人，这成为农业劳动力转移的主要途径；二是向城市转移。城市一些服务业和部分工业生产部门需要招收一些能适应行业劳动特点的农业剩余劳动力。“六五”期间，每年平均有近百万农业劳动力转为城市工人，其转入总量占“六五”期间城市新增就业人员总数的13.4％。其次，近几年来，每年都有数百万农村建筑工人在城市从事各种建筑活动，还有部分农民进城经商及从事其它服务业。
    目前我国正在进行治理整顿时期，城市不可能继续吸纳大量农业剩余劳动力。所以，近期内农业剩余劳动力的主要转移途径，只能是在农村就地消化，它的数量不宜过多，速度不宜过快。在这种转移过程中，还需要抓紧作好一系列工作。首先，要利用税收和信贷等经济手段鼓励乡镇企业利用治理整顿的机遇积极调整和优化结构，如生产紧俏适销的产品、名优产品及发展能源工业、交通运输业、原材料工业、支农工业等，使之既能提高有效供给，又能适
  当吸纳农业剩余劳动力。其次，国家外贸部门应增加在农村的投资，发展小型、劳动密集型的创汇企业，特别要大力发展我国传统的手工艺品及编织、刺绣等能吸收大量劳动力的产品的生产。第三，政府有关部门要有计划地组织农业剩余劳动力转移。目前，我国经济发达地区与落后地区存在着就业机会差别，必然导致农业劳动力由经济落后地区向发达经济地区的转移。这需要有关部门进行组织和管理，以避免劳动力盲目转移带来的一系列社会问题。
    从长远看，农业剩余劳动力向城市工业与其他产业部门转移的规模将会越来越大。它对整个国民经济和社会发展具有巨大推动作用，表现在：第一，能够促进社会资源合理流动，改善资源配置状态，使生产要素由边际生产率较低的部门转向较高的部门，从而会不断提高社会生产的总收益水平；第二，在允许少数农业剩余劳动力进城的情况下，通过适当的合理的竞争，有利于促使城市企业职工精心工作、提高劳动生产率；第三，可以避免或减少由于农业剩余劳动力只向农村非农产业转移，对经济和社会发展所造成的某些不良影响。城市类型有大中小三个层次。我国现有的大城市分布不合理，要根据本地区的情况，有计划地把少数中型城市发展为大城市。对于某些工业企业不宜集中在大城市中的，需要有计划地向中小城市迁移，特别是近几年崛起的乡镇工业，有一些也需要适当向中小城市集中。如今我国中小城市在数量上还远远不适应以上需要，因此还需大力发展中小城市，包括星罗棋布的小城镇。中小城市的发展既能适应乡村工业集聚的需要，又符合城市化要求。所以从中长期考虑，农业剩余劳动力转移的最佳途径可能是：大部分以乡镇工业为载体，通过乡镇工业集聚进入中型特别是小型城市，同时要有适量劳动力为满足大城市某些行业和部门的需要而进入大城市。
    为了实现农村劳动力的转移，必须加强农村教育，提高农民素质。这在很大程度上决定了其就业范围。文化水平高则易掌握技术，利用市场能力较强，其就业门路就多；反之，其就业范围就很窄。但教育结构必须随着国民经济中部门结构的变化而变化，否则即使劳动力总量与经济增长的需要相适应，但劳动力结构却不能满足经济增长的需要。为此，不仅要对即将转移的农业剩余劳动力进行各种形式的文化及技术培训，更重要的是必须通过多种方式增加教育投资，以加强农村基础教育，改善教育结构，提高农村后备劳动力的文化素质。只有这样才有利于农业剩余劳动力的转移。
