Finally, I have fulfilled my dream.

In my view, there were only ice-covered mountains and snow-filled valleys, vast and white, hazy and misty. The wind carried snow, and the snow rode the wind, rolling and roaring across the ground, piercing the ears, striking the face, chilling the heart… Is this the Big Gully Village I have longed for day and night? Is this the village where my uncle settled in the Greater Khingan Range?

I squinted my eyes, circling around to search, but where were the people? Where were the houses? Where were the village streets?

Fortunately, a man who got off the car with me pointed out: “Look, there! There! They are all buried under the snow!”

I looked around and was surprised: within a radius of tens of miles, there wasn’t a single tree!

Ah, Big Gully Village, where is your boundless forest? In novels and movies, isn’t this a very beautiful place? In my imagination, you have enticing greenery, enchanting pine forests, fragrant flowers, and melodious bird songs… But I love the winter forest even more, the ice icicles, the clusters of jade-like trees… Oh, I suddenly remembered and asked the man: “Did a big fire burn down the forest here?” He shook his head. I asked him again: “Are there many wild animals here?” He shook his head again. He kept his lips tightly pressed together, saying nothing. I was puzzled. Only because I asked insistently did he open his mouth. It turned out that he was a native of Big Gully Village. For generations, they have made a living by hunting and logging, but now the trees have been cut down, and the wild animals have run away, so he has no means of livelihood. He was furious about this. He said, “Here, without the surrounding forest, the weather has gone crazy, becoming more and more abnormal. In spring, the wind blows so hard that people can’t open their eyes; in winter, the snow blocks the doors so people can’t go out. If this continues, maybe even people will leave…”

I couldn’t help but feel moved, and before he finished speaking, I hurriedly asked, “So what should we do in the future? Are you going to leave too?”

Unexpectedly, he stamped his foot, as if arguing with someone, and swore, “Leave? Only cowards leave! Think about it, in the past few years, we made a living by cutting down trees; in recent years, we made a fortune by cutting down trees; now, the ancestral food is finished, and we just leave, letting future generations curse us?!” Saying this, he suddenly stopped and sealed his mouth tightly again.

I didn’t know if he was angry at himself or at others. Looking at him, snow on his eyebrows, snow on his beard, biting his lips and glaring at the distant wind and snow, his open collar puffing out hot breath, the fiery red wool sweater on his heaving chest seemed to be burning… He must have some unspeakable pain.

That day, although I saw my longed-for uncle and his family, and although I saw that their home was no longer as poor as before; although I received the warm hospitality of the people of Big Gully Village, and although I knew that they had planned a grand goal of returning the mountains to forests, I still couldn’t be optimistic. That night, I lay on my uncle’s warm kang, my mood couldn’t calm down for a long time…

Outside the window, it seemed as if there was a roar of celestial music!

The wind, howling, whistling, wailing, like a thousand waves roaring, like ten thousand thunders rolling, making the earth tremble, making the sky shiver, suffocating all the weak sounds…

Suddenly, a picture appeared before my eyes: in the picture, there was the man with his lips bitten and eyes glaring, there was my uncle and his family, there were the men and women of Big Gully Village. They, carrying the gray shame, carrying the fiery indignation, carrying clusters of green hope, walked towards the wild valleys, walked towards the bare hills, walked towards the arena built by nature…

Ah, the green forests of Big Gully Village are already coming in people’s dreams…

    大兴安岭有个大沟屯
    李耀奎
    我终于兑现了自己的梦。
    视野里，除了冰岭雪谷，还是冰岭雪谷，白茫茫，迷蒙蒙，风卷着雪，雪驾着风，滚地吼叫着，刺人耳，扑人脸，凉人心……哦，这就是我日思夜想的大沟屯吗？这就是我叔来大兴安岭落户的大沟屯吗？
    瞪大眼，兜着圈圈寻，人在哪儿？房子在哪儿？村街又在哪儿呢？
    幸亏有个一块下车的汉子指教：那不是吗？那不是吗？都在一堆堆雪里埋着呢！
    放眼望去，我吃了一惊：方圆十几里，竟没有一棵树！
    啊，大沟屯，你那无边无际的森林呢？在小说中、电影里，这不是很美很美的地方吗？在我的想象里，你有诱人的绿色，有迷人的松涛，有芳香的百花，有动听的鸟语……可是，我更爱冬天森林的雄姿，喜欢那一串串冰挂，一簇簇如玉的树丛……哦，我忽然想起，便问那汉子：这里的森林，是不是让那场大火烧了？他摇摇头。我又问他：这儿的野兽很多吗？他又摇了摇头。他一直死死咬着唇，什么也不说。我纳闷极了。只因我追问得急，他才启了口。原来，他就是大沟屯人，祖祖辈辈以狩猎伐木为生，而如今，这里的树被砍光了，野兽也跑光了，他便没了营生可做，正为此憋着一肚子气呢。他说，“这里，周围没了林子，老天爷便发疯了，气候变得一年比一年怪，春上，风刮得人睁不开眼；冬里，雪堵得人出不了门，再这样下去，恐怕连人也会走光的……”
    我不禁心里一动，不等他说完，忙又问：“那今后可该咋办？你也打算走么？”
    不料，他一顿足，像与人吵嘴似地，赌死咒活地说：“走？孬种才走！想得美，头些年靠砍伐林子养家糊口；这几年，靠砍伐林子发了大财；如今，祖宗饭吃到了头，一拍屁股走，落个后人骂？！”说着，他忽然停住，又把嘴紧紧封死了。
    我不知他是在恨他自己，还是在恨别人。看他那样子，眉上挂着雪，胡须上也挂着雪，咬唇怒目地注视着风雪弥漫的远处，敞开的领口呼呼冒着热气，那件火红火红的毛衣在他一起一伏的胸前仿佛熊熊燃烧着……他一定有什么难言之苦。
    这天，我虽然见到了日思夜想的老叔一家，而且也看到了他家不再像过去那样贫穷；我虽然得到了大沟屯人的热情款待，而且也知道了他们已拟定出还岭以林的宏伟目标，但我怎么也乐观不起来。这夜里，我歇在老叔热腾腾的暖炕上，心情久久不能平静……
    窗外，仿佛有一片如何喧嚣的天籁！
    风，呼呼、嗖嗖、呜呜，似千浪汹啸，如万雷滚鸣，大地为之颤摇，长空为之抖栗，窒息了一切细弱的声响……
    蓦然，我眼前浮动起一幅画图：画中，有那个咬唇怒目的汉子，有老叔一家人，有大沟屯男男女女。他们，掮着灰色的羞辱，掮着火红的愤激，掮着一簇簇黛绿的希冀，走向蛮荒的野谷，走向秃秃的旷岭，走向大自然构筑的擂台……
    啊，大沟屯的绿色森林，已在人们的梦中走来……
