Since July 26, heavy rains have been falling in the Minjiang River Basin within Sichuan Province, affecting areas such as Ya'an, Chengdu, Leshan, and Yibin. As a result, the Minjiang River has risen sharply, exceeding the warning level and reaching a height of 277.8 meters, second only to the highest flood level recorded in 1966.

All vessels on the Minjiang River have been halted, and some residential houses and warehouses in Yibin City have been flooded. The floodwaters have destroyed one bridge and two log-rafting facilities, sweeping away 5,000 cubic meters of timber from a town, posing a threat to the safety of downstream bridges, dams, and vessels. The heavy rain has also caused a landslide in Yibin City, with tens of thousands of cubic meters of mud and debris destroying two buildings and burying 17 people. Of the three people already rescued, one has died and two are seriously injured. The fate of the remaining 14 people is unknown.
