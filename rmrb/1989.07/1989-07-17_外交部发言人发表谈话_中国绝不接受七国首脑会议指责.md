The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that the political declaration issued by the Western Seven-Nation Summit on July 15 continues to unjustly criticize and exert pressure on China. The Chinese government cannot but express great regret over this.

When asked by reporters for comments on the part of the Seven-Nation Summit's political declaration concerning China, the spokesperson said that the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the People's Republic of China in Beijing is purely an internal affair of China. The Seven-Nation Summit's rude interference in China's internal affairs and exertion of pressure on China violate the most basic principles of international relations, which the Chinese government absolutely cannot accept. Their actions are also unwise and will ultimately harm themselves.

He said, the Chinese government formulates its domestic and foreign policies based on the fundamental interests of the Chinese people and the overall trend of international developments, and will not change its established basic policies due to some temporary factors. China will unswervingly implement the policy of reform and opening up and an independent and peaceful foreign policy. We are willing to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and resolutely oppose any behavior that deviates from these principles and interferes in the internal affairs of other countries.

    外交部发言人发表谈话
    中国绝不接受七国首脑会议指责
    新华社北京7月17日电  外交部发言人今天在这里说，西方七国首脑会议在7月15日发表的政治宣言中，继续对中国横加指责，施加压力。对此，中国政府不能不表示极大的遗憾。
    当记者问发言人对七国首脑会议政治宣言有关中国问题的部分有何评论时，发言人说，中国政府平息在北京发生的旨在颠覆中华人民共和国的反革命暴乱，完全是中国的内政。七国首脑会议粗暴干涉中国内政，向中国施加压力，违反了最起码的国际关系准则，是中国政府所绝对不能接受的。它们的这种做法也是不明智的，到头来只会给它们自己带来损害。
    他说，中国政府是根据中国人民的根本利益和国际形势发展的总趋势来制定内外政策的，不会因为一些暂时因素而改变自己的既定基本方针。中国将坚定不移地执行改革开放政策和独立自主的和平外交政策。我们愿意根据和平共处五项原则同各国发展友好合作关系，坚决反对任何背离五项原则、干涉他国内政的行为。
