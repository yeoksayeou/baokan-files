Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 15th. People's Daily reporter Chen Guoqing and Xinhua News Agency reporter Ren Xianliang report: How does a poverty-stricken old revolutionary base achieve prosperity? Ping Mountain County in Hebei Province has used the spirit of hard work and selfless dedication to educate and inspire its officials and people, leveraging the political advantages of the old revolutionary base, not waiting for handouts, and striving for self-reliance to revitalize the economy. In just a few years, the county's face has undergone significant changes, making this county, which once had a glorious past, now also have a glorious present.

Ping Mountain County is located in the Taihang Mountains and is the site where the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held its Seventh Plenary Session and directed the Three Major Campaigns.

The Ping Mountain County Committee has taken the lead in carrying forward the spirit of hard work, starting from itself, and canceling the plan to build a new office building, continuing to work in the cramped, narrow, and damp small building built a few years ago. Following the lead of the county committee, the county people's congress and other county-level departments have also canceled their relocation plans.

In the past, county-level cadres were reluctant to take up positions in townships, "preferring to lose their jobs rather than go to the mountains." Now, this situation has changed significantly. In the past year alone, more than 130 party members and cadres have voluntarily applied to work at the grassroots level.

The revitalization of spirit has driven unprecedented economic development across the county. In just one year, the county has reclaimed 326,000 mu of woodland, including 70,000 mu of economic forests, equivalent to the total of the past 10 years before 1986.

    老区居功不自傲  脱贫克服等靠要
    平山艰苦奋斗兴县
    本报石家庄7月15日电  本报记者陈国琦、新华社记者任贤良报道：贫困老区靠什么精神脱贫致富？河北省平山县用艰苦奋斗、无私奉献的精神教育和激励干部群众，发挥老区政治优势，不等不靠，自力更生振兴经济。短短几年，全县面貌发生很大变化，使这个曾经有着光荣过去的老区县，如今也有了光荣的现在。
    平山县地处太行山区，是党中央召开七届二中全会和指挥三大战役的所在地。
    平山县委带头发扬艰苦奋斗精神，从自身做起，取消了迁建办公楼的计划，仍然在几年前建造的拥挤狭窄、阴暗潮湿的小楼里办公。在县委的带动下，县人大及其他县直部门也都取消了搬迁计划。
    过去县直干部都不愿到乡镇任职，“宁愿丢官，不愿上山”。现在这种状况得到明显改变。去年以来已有130多名党员干部主动申请到基层工作。
    精神的振奋，带动了全县经济前所未有的大发展。仅去年一年，这一个县就开垦林地32.6万亩，其中经济林7万亩，相当于1986年前10年的总和。
