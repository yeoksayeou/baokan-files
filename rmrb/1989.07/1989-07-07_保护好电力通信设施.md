In recent years, in many mountainous areas, plains, railway lines, and military strategic locations, it has often been found that power poles standing on the ground have been destroyed, and overhead power lines have been cut. Normal operating power equipment has been dismantled. Such acts of theft and sabotage of power and communication facilities have caused telephone lines to be disrupted, lights to go out, and machinery to stop running, bringing great difficulties and harm to people's production, life, and military activities.

For these illegal criminal activities, judicial authorities have been continuously cracking down, and newspapers have been continuously exposing them, but they have not been effectively stopped. To protect power and communication facilities and effectively prevent, reduce, and even eliminate such illegal criminal activities, based on the situation reflected in readers' letters, efforts need to be made in three areas: First, severe punishment. Sabotaging power and communication facilities is a serious illegal criminal activity that endangers public safety, social management order, and the Four Modernizations. Criminals are aware of the functions of power and communication facilities and the consequences of their actions, making their actions and nature extremely malicious. Only by severely punishing them according to the law can we effectively deter such activities; second, strict purchase measures. Due to the purchase by scrap collection departments, criminals have a way to sell their stolen goods, leading to frequent incidents. Therefore, it is necessary to rectify the scrap collection market, strengthen management, and plug loopholes. Third, strengthen legal education and propaganda, guide farmers to take the correct path to prosperity, and not harm national and collective interests for personal gain.

    保护好电力通信设施
    这几年来，在不少的山川平原、铁路沿线、军事要地，经常发现屹立在地面上的电杆被毁，横越天空的电线被割，正常运转的电力设备被拆。这类盗窃破坏电力、通信设施行为，造成了电话不通，电灯不亮，机器不转，给人们的生产、生活以及军事活动，带来极大困难和危害。
    对于这类违法犯罪活动，司法部门不断在打击，报纸也不断在揭露，但仍禁止不住。为了保护好电力、通信设施，有效地防止、减少以至杜绝这类违法犯罪行为，从读者来信反映的情况看，需要从三个方面下功夫：一是从严惩处。破坏电力、通信设施，是危害公共安全、社会管理秩序和四化建设的严重违法犯罪。不法分子是在明知电力、通讯设施的功能，明知作案后所造成的后果而行动的，情节和性质都是恶劣的。只有依法从严惩处，才能起到有力制止的作用；二是严格收购措施。由于废品收购部门的收购，使不法分子销赃有路，于是频频作案。因此，要整顿废旧物资收购市场，严格管理，堵塞漏洞。三是加强法制宣传教育，引导农民走正确的致富之路，不要为私利而损害国家集体利益。
