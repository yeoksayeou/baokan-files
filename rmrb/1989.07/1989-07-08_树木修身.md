Tree trunks are mostly cylindrical in shape, which looks aesthetically pleasing, but when sawed into rectangular wooden boards, up to 35% of the trunk becomes sawdust and waste wood, which can at most be used for papermaking. This results in significant waste. A graduate student at Columbia University in the United States, Faz, has discovered a method to shape tree trunks into a rectangular form through years of experimentation. The principle is that under the influence of certain hormones and external forces, the cambium layer of the tree can change its growth shape. This shaping "surgery" can only be performed during the young tree stage, and generally, it takes only 5 minutes to shape each young tree. The wood quality of these "rectangular trees" is the same as that of ordinary trees. Currently, Faz has successfully cultivated 20 Douglas firs and poplars with rectangular trunks.

    树木修身
    树干大多呈圆柱形，看上去美观，但锯割成长方形的木板后却有高达35％的树干“沦”为木屑和废木料，至多只能当作造纸用料，浪费惊人。美国哥伦比亚大学的研究生法兹经多年试验已发现了一种将树木“身段”修为方形的办法，其原理是：在某种激素及外力的作用下，树木的形成层能改变生长形状，这种修整“手术”只能在幼树期进行，一般情况下对每株幼树进行整形只需费时5分钟。这种“方形树木”的木材质量与一般树木完全相同。目前，法兹已成功地培养了树干呈方形的20株西洋杉和白杨。
