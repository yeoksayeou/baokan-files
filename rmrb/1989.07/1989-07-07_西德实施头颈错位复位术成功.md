West German surgeons have successfully performed a head and neck dislocation reduction surgery on a patient. This follows the successful reattachment surgery performed in Arizona, USA, in April this year.

According to the West German "Bild" newspaper, a 23-year-old worker named Zauske from the Volkswagen factory in West Germany was involved in a motorcycle accident with a freight train on May 17th. He was thrown 15 meters away and lost consciousness, with his head bent forward.

Several weeks later, it was discovered that his head was still dislocated and tilted to one side. He was then sent back to the surgical department of the Hannover Medical Center.

On June 16th, Professor Gab and Dr. Stavenhagen performed the head and neck dislocation reduction surgery. They first used a magnifying glass to remove the part of the bone pressing on the spinal cord through the patient's mouth. 48 hours later, they reattached the head to the cervical vertebrae through an incision in the neck and used a piece of bone taken from the patient's pelvis to fix and suture the head in place.

Fourteen days after the surgery, the young man was able to eat and speak normally and could sit up in bed.

    西德实施头颈错位复位术成功
    新华社波恩7月2日电  继美国亚利桑那州今年4月成功地进行了继首再植手术后，西德外科医生又救活了一名在交通事故中头部和颈部折断错位的伤员。
    据西德《图片报》报道，西德大众汽车厂23岁的工人曹斯克，今年5月17日驾驶摩托车与一列货车相撞时被抛出15米之外，失去知觉，头向前折弯。
    几个星期以后发现，他头部错位长歪了，再度被送进汉诺威医院外科部。
    6月16日，加布教授和施塔芬斯基大夫大胆施行了头颈错位复位手术。他们首先依靠放大镜，通过病人口腔将压迫脊髓的那部分骨头切除。48小时后，再通过颈部的一个切口，重新作成头部与颈椎的接头，并用病人骨盆上取下的部分骨头将病人头部固定、缝合。
    手术14天后，这个年轻人已能正常吃饭、说话，可坐在床上。
