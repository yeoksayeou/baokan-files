	Yellow River, what are you saying?

	Amidst roars like thunder, clouds of mist rise. No waterfalls, no abyss, only yellow waves surging towards the sky, churning, tearing, extraordinarily ferocious...

	Yellow River, I do not know why you are like this.

	From the bridge at the border of Qin and Jin, looking down, the gray-white sandbars, the jutting rocks, the scattered green flagstones, lie bare in the evening sunlight. Near the center of the riverbed, a chasm about forty to fifty meters wide opens up. The Yellow River flows within this sunken bed. I am somewhat disappointed. What has happened to the Yellow River? When did it become so narrow and deep? Where has its vast, boundless, sky-blue expanse gone?

	In Lanzhou, in Yinchuan, in Fenglingdu, I have stood for a long time by the Yellow River. Yes, the Yellow River has the pride and tolerance of our nation's mother. It erodes the plateau, carries silt, and nurtures the descendants of the Yellow Emperor.

	Spreading across the sky and earth, the calm and the turbulent, the tranquil and the erosion, people have become accustomed to this majestic flow over thousands of years.

	The nearby mountain ranges have retreated a great deal, faintly outlined against the gray-white sky. Below the mountains, there is also sand and stone. The riverbed lies bare, as if waiting for the Yellow River to approach it whenever it wishes. The river water, however, flows close to Shaanxi, and I feel a sense of possessive satisfaction. The Yellow River is mine.

	Turning north along the mountain path, I see in the distance a series of waterfalls cascading from the riverbank in Shanxi into the gorge, splashing a sheet of milky white mist and waves. I thought this must be the Hukou Waterfall. The Huangguoshu Waterfall is more graceful, I think. There, apart from the silver-white of the falling water, everything is enveloped in lush greenery. But before me is a vast yellow expanse. Having seen the Yellow River's vast and tranquil form so often, this series of waterfalls arouses my interest. But my friend says, this is not the Hukou Waterfall; this is just a tributary, a lonely watercourse that has not surged into the gorge. I feel a sense of kinship. This tributary, is it not the Yellow River's offspring? Perhaps it knows a passionate traveler has come, and it raises its arms, waving its graceful sleeves in dance?

	Suddenly, the scene changes dramatically. From within the clouds of mist that rise to the sky, roars like thunder can be heard. Behind the mist, wave after wave of yellow giant waves roll and churn. Behind the roaring waves, the Yellow River water surges towards the sky, engulfing the entire valley...

	Language here is pale and powerless. I do not know who can depict the Yellow River's moment of swallowing the sky and spitting out the earth. A sea of yellow flames, the river boiling over, as if in battle, struggling fiercely, tossed and swept by an unknown force, rolling madly into the whirling mist and the abyss...

	Yellow River, you flow freely and at will, why do you suddenly gather here? The sky and earth are still so vast, why do you rage? Are you proving your strength to people, or pouring out your passion to the heavens?

	Yellow River, you confuse me, you make me uneasy...

	Crossing a wide stretch of water, holding my friend's hand, I jump from one green stone to another, then into a water hole just big enough for one person, and I rush towards the waterfall.

	A wave of surging water, a mist enveloping, a downpour, a surge of excitement and temptation! I stand in the water, in the mist, in the rain, in the waves, my soul shaken. I hear the drums of heaven thunder, I see the fires of the earth erupt, my heart burns, I feel a passion for life and death, creation and annihilation. This must have been the era of chaos, the heavens and earth opened up, and all things began to thrive. From here, there were the sun, moon, and stars, spring, summer, autumn, and winter, you, me, love, and life...

	Facing the waterfall, I cease to exist. I am a drop of water, a wisp of mist, vanishing with the Yellow River's waves, seeking eternity.

	The ancients said: The source flows from Kunlun, creating a great current; the Jade Pass winds nine times, and a pot collects it; peach blossom rain flies, creating a mirage, and at the third watch, the whale and the dragon dare to capsize the boat; the turtle's head cannot be found with ordinary fishing hooks, unless it is the fishing hook of a fairy under the moonlight. I am ignorant of ancient poetry, and I cannot taste its flavor. Perhaps it is the barrier of time. But I think, ancient literati and poets standing here imagined fishing for turtles, my feelings must be too empty! I always think that the long, winding journey has made the Yellow River weary, and the infiltration of sand and mud has made it restless; the silent desolation and stillness of both banks, and the endless praises and eulogies of the world have made it angry! It is troubled, it is suppressed, it wants to vent, to roar, to awaken its children...

	Yellow River, is this so? You suddenly gather, suddenly rage, suddenly like an axe or a sword, splitting the giant rocks, surging towards the earth's core. Why is your unrestrained soul in pain?

	The river of life flows day and night. Sometimes, beneath the calm surface, there is a loss of passion and indifference. Sitting in the office for too long, one feels a lifetime of meaninglessness, crawling on paper.

	The spring breeze blows over the fields, bringing a fresh scent, and one wants to go out for a walk, without imagining any gentle or magnificent scenery. However, nature is so understanding, facing the Yellow River waterfall, I suddenly realize a surge of life's passion in my heart. Yellow River, you do love your daughter!

	The green stone slabs under my feet are flowing with clear streams. This is the river water that has not rushed into the Hukou Waterfall and has calmed down. It is as clear and transparent as a mountain spring. Round holes, some as small as teacups, others as large as water jars, stretch straight or diagonally into the stone bottom, strangely wandering on the riverbed. I reach down my arm, suddenly feeling a powerful pull, straight down. I quickly grab my friend's hand, my heart pounding, I feel the power of the whirlpool. A person is naturally small, and in the face of nature's mysterious life force, a person is even more insignificant. The meaning of existence makes life real. What is right and wrong, honor and disgrace, perhaps life's creation is like the whirlpool in the riverbed, though not smooth, the river's life will not stop...

	Those men who drifted on the Yellow River are the embodiment of life!

	Have you experienced the fury of life? Have you felt the love and hate that tear at your heart? Have you ever shouted and laughed freely, hearing the blood singing in your veins?

	Grass sprouts from the cracks in the rocks. Magma surges in the mantle. Flesh and blood build the Great Wall. Gentle arms reach out to the universe...

	Wild poppies bloom like dreams across the desert, the vast Gobi Desert floats with an unsetting sun, a small boat is moored on the lonely riverbank, and someone lights a gentle lamp in a small wooden house in the great forest...

	Where is there no life? Where is there no passion for life?

	Yellow River, are you enlightening me?

	I am soaked, happily shouting at the Yellow River. I am no longer the anxious, repressed, and indecisive me. People can only be reborn through creation. The unrestrained soul is in the waves, in the rain, in the mist, in the thunder, in the surging and plunging, casting off laziness, casting off carelessness, casting off outdated customs and inherited burdens, reborn.

	Yellow River, what else do you want to say to me?

### 黄河，你在说什么

    黄河，你在说什么
    李佩芝
    一阵阵雷鸣般的怒吼声中，一团团水雾升腾。不见飞瀑，不见深渊，眼前只有黄色的巨涛铺天盖地而来，翻腾，撕咬，异常狂暴……
    黄河，我不知道你为什么这样。
    从秦晋交界的桥头朝下望，灰白的沙滩，突兀的怪石，错落的青石板，冷寂地袒露在夕照里。近河床中心，裂出一道四五十米宽的深谷，黄河，便在凹陷的床谷中奔流。我有些失望了，黄河怎么啦，什么时候变得这么狭隘，这么幽深，它那浩浩淼淼、天水一色的气度哪儿去了？
    在兰州，在银川，在风陵渡，我曾久久地在黄河边伫立。是的，黄河具有我们民族母亲般的骄傲与宽容。它冲荡高原，挟裹泥沙，繁衍着黄帝的子孙。
    漫天铺地而来，平缓的湍急，安详的吞蚀，人们已经习惯了这几千年流淌的威势。
    近邻的山脉默默后退了许多，映在灰白的天际，淡淡幻出峰峦的剪影。山下亦是沙，石。河床袒露着期待，仿佛只要黄河愿意，什么时候亲近它都可以。河水却贴近陕西，我有一种占有欲的满足，黄河，是我的。
    沿山路北折，远远望见一排流瀑，从山西的河滩上跌进峡谷，飞溅着一片乳白色的水雾与浪花。我以为这就是壶口。黄果树瀑布比它娟秀，我想。那儿除了落水时的银白，一切罩在葱绿青翠中。然而眼前是一片苍黄。平日多见了黄河浩荡平和的模样，这一排瀑布便引起我的兴致，然而朋友说，这不是壶口，这只不过是一条支流，一条没有腾入峡谷的寂寞的水流罢了。我觉着亲切了。这支流，不就是黄河的小儿女么？莫非它知道来了个痴迷的旅人，便飞起手臂，扬起柔曼的舞袖？
    突然，前面景观大变，一团团冲天的云雾中传出雷鸣般的狂吼，雾后是一排排翻卷着土黄色巨浪的激流，而咆啸的浪涛后，黄河水铺天盖地，拥荡着整个山谷……
    语言在此是苍白无力的。我不知道谁能描绘出黄河在这里吞天吐地的刹那情态。一片黄色烈焰，满河滚沸，又似在厮杀，狂搏，被不可知的力量掀腾，席卷，疯狂跌入水雾旋漫的深渊……
    黄河，你自由自在、随意流淌，为什么突然在此凝集？天地依旧这么广袤，为什么你要暴怒？你在向人们证明你的力量，还是向上苍倾泻你的激情？
    黄河，你使我困惑，使我不安……
    涉过很宽一段水流，拉着朋友的手，从一块青石跳下另一块青石，再跳下一个容身一人的水洞，我奔向瀑布。
    一阵狂涛卷来，一阵水雾缠绕，一阵暴雨泼过，一阵阵冲动诱惑！我站在水中，雾中，雨里，浪里，灵魂震撼了。我听见天鼓轰鸣，看见地火喷腾，心燃烧起来，感受到一种生与死创造与幻灭的激情。这以前定是浑沌纪元，天地由此开辟，万物由此滋生。从这儿，才有日月星辰，有了春夏秋冬，有了你，有了我，有了爱与生命……
    面对瀑布，我不复存在，我是一滴水，一缕雾，随黄涛而逝，去寻觅永恒。
    古人云：源出昆仑衍大流，玉关九转一壶收；桃浪雨飞翻海市，三鼓鲸麟敢负舟；鳖头未可寻常钓，除是羽仙明月钩。我昧于古诗，我品不出它的味儿。也许这是时代的隔膜。但我想，古代文人骚客站在此地竟有钓鳖的想象，我的感觉怕是太虚空了！我总以为是漫长崎岖旅途使黄河倦乏了，是沙泥的渗浸使它烦躁；两岸不动声色的荒凉与沉寂，世人不绝于口的颂歌谥词令它愤怒了！它苦闷，它压抑，它要发泄，要狂吼，要惊醒它的儿女……
    黄河，是这样么？你突然凝聚，突然狂暴，突然如斧如剑劈开巨石，向地心涌去，你不羁的灵魂为什么痛苦呢？
    生命的江流，日夜递嬗。在平静的水面下，有时也有失却热情的淡漠。办公室久坐着，会生出一辈子毫无意义的在纸格上爬行的烦腻。
    春风拂过田野清新的气息，便想外出走走，不曾设想什么景色的温柔或辉煌，然而，大自然这般善解人意，我面对黄河瀑布，突然感悟到一股生命的激情在深心处勃发。黄河，你毕竟爱你的女儿啊！
    脚下的青石板，奔泻着道道清流。这是没有挤进壶口去的平静下来的河水，它像山泉般晶莹清澈了。一个个小如茶杯，大如水瓮的圆洞，或直或斜直伸石底，在河床上奇怪地散步着。我探下手臂，猛感到一股巨大的引力，直向下拽，我忙拉住朋友的手，心呯呯跳着，我感受到水漩的力量了。一个人自然是渺小的，在大自然神奇的生命力面前，一个人更微不足道。生存的意义使生命真实，说什么是是非非，宠辱得失，也许人生有些创造犹如黄河漩在河床上的洞穴，虽不复平舒，但江流的生命不会静止……那几个飘流黄河的男子，就是大写意的生命！
    你体验过生命的狂烈么？感受过撕裂心肺的爱和恨么？你可曾痛快淋漓的大叫、大笑，听到血液在周身欢唱？
    小草从石隙中抽出嫩芽。岩浆在地幔奔涌。血肉之躯筑起长城。柔曼的手臂探向宇宙……
    野罂粟如梦如幻开遍荒原，大戈壁托浮着不落的夕阳，一叶小舟泊在孤寂的江岸，不知谁在大森林的小木屋中亮起了温柔的灯火……
    哪里没有生命？哪里没有生命的激情？
    黄河，你在启示我么？
    我浑身湿淋淋的，快活地朝黄河大叫。我不再是那个忧心、压抑、患得患失的我了。人唯有创造，才有新生。不羁的灵魂在浪中，雨中，雾中，雷霆万钧中，在狂腾与暴跌中，丢掉惰怠，丢掉散漫，丢掉陈规陋习与世袭的重负，脱胎换骨了。
    黄河，你还要对我说什么？
