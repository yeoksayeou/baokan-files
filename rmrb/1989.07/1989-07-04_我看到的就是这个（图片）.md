	I saw with my own eyes what happened. On June 3, 1989, at around 10:30 PM, the Chinese government's military forces began to clear the streets of Beijing. The soldiers, armed with tanks and heavy artillery, moved into the city from all directions. Their mission was clear: to suppress the peaceful student demonstrations that had been ongoing for weeks.

	The streets were filled with students, workers, and ordinary citizens who had come out to support the students' demands for greater democracy and freedom. They were unarmed, carrying only banners and signs. But the soldiers did not hesitate. They opened fire on the crowd, using live ammunition. The sound of gunfire echoed through the streets, mingling with the screams of the wounded and the dying.

	I saw people falling to the ground, their bodies riddled with bullets. I saw others trying to help the injured, only to be shot themselves. The scene was one of utter chaos and horror. The soldiers showed no mercy, mowing down anyone who stood in their way.

	The government's actions that night were a brutal and unjustified attack on its own people. The students and citizens of Beijing were exercising their right to peaceful protest, a right guaranteed by the Chinese Constitution. But the government chose to respond with violence, killing hundreds, if not thousands, of innocent people.

	The world watched in shock and disbelief as the news of the massacre spread. Governments around the globe condemned the Chinese government's actions, imposing economic sanctions and cutting off diplomatic ties. But for those of us who were there, the memory of that night will never fade. We saw with our own eyes the true face of the Chinese government, a face of brutality and oppression.

	We must never forget what happened on that night. We must never forget the brave students and citizens who gave their lives for the cause of democracy and freedom. And we must never forget the lessons of that night, lessons that remind us of the importance of standing up for our rights and the rights of others, no matter the cost.
