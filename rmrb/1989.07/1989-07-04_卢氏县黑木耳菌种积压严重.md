Lushi County is a major production area for black fungus in our province. Currently, there are 325 spawn factories, producing 70 million bottles of spawn annually. Last year, the sales of spawn were very good, meeting the local demand and also being sold to other regions. However, this year, Lushi County has only sold 10 million bottles of black fungus spawn, with 300 million bottles backlogged, valued at 1.8 million yuan. Given the production characteristics of edible fungi, after entering May, as the temperature gradually rises, all spawn will age and become unusable. Now, most of the spawn factories, which were established with poverty alleviation funds, are in dire straits, with some on the verge of closure.

The main reasons for the large backlog of black fungus spawn are as follows: First, climate impact. Last winter and this spring saw heavy snowfall, preventing farmers from timely felling trees for black fungus frames. As a result, the number of black fungus frames in the county dropped from 180,000 last year to 40,000 this year, significantly reducing the demand for spawn. Second, the price of black fungus has fallen. In 1987, the selling price of black fungus was 42 yuan per kilogram, but it dropped to 30 yuan last year. Meanwhile, the price of spawn has risen due to repeated increases in the cost of raw materials, making the production of edible fungi more costly and less profitable. This has led some farmers to be reluctant to cultivate black fungus. Additionally, the procurement departments had a large backlog of black fungus last year, causing funds to be tied up, and some farmers have been holding white receipts for months without receiving cash. Third, the eagerness of mountain villagers to get rich quickly has led to a rush to build factories, blind competition, and uncontrolled development, resulting in an oversupply of black fungus.

Lushi County is one of the key poverty alleviation counties in the country, and most farmers have not yet solved the problem of basic sustenance. We appeal to experts to provide guidance, helping farmers to get out of the current predicament.

### 卢氏县黑木耳菌种积压严重

    卢氏县黑木耳菌种积压严重
    卢氏县是我省黑木耳重点产区，现有菌种厂325家，年生产菌种700万瓶。去年菌种销售情况很好，除满足本县使用外，还销往外地。今年以来，卢氏县仅销售100万瓶黑木耳菌种，积压300万瓶，价值180万元。根据食用菌生产特点，进入5月后，由于气温逐渐升高，所有菌种将老化而报废。现在，多数靠扶贫款建起的菌种厂陷入困境，有的濒临倒闭。
    木耳菌种大量滞销的主要原因是：一、气候影响。去冬今春连降大雪，农民不能适时上山砍伐木耳架，因此全县木耳架由去年的18万架减为今年的4万架，造成菌种需求量大大减少。二、木耳价跌。1987年每公斤黑木耳销售价为42元，去年下跌为30元，而菌种价格因所配原料连番涨价而涨价，使食用菌生产投入多、收入少，致使一些农民不愿种植黑木耳；另外，收购部门去年收购的黑木耳大量积压，资金沉滞，一些农民手持白条数月得不到现款。三、山区群众致富心切，一哄而上，盲目建厂，相互攀比，发展失控，导致黑木耳生产过剩。
    卢氏县是全国重点扶贫县之一，多数农民尚未解决温饱问题，呼吁专家们予以指导，使农民摆脱目前的困境。
