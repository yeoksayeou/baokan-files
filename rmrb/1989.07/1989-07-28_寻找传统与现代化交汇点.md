        An Experiment in Rationality

    Recently, Jiǎn Rén Yuán and his eight neighbors at No. 50, Shí Zǐ Street, moved back into their newly renovated old residence. Jiǎn Rén Yuán is satisfied with the addition of private kitchens and bathrooms in the renovated old courtyard, as well as the communal activity space.

    This is a traditional Suzhou-style courtyard house with four deep sections, covering 1,000 square meters, housing 19 staff members of the Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou Medical College. Originally, Jiǎn Rén Yuán lived in a 40-square-meter room. With his children growing up, the toilet being 300 meters away, he found it very inconvenient. The renovated No. 50 courtyard retains the ancient architectural style of deep courtyards, while the interior has been modernized, making it economically feasible at only 150 yuan per square meter.

    The renovation project at No. 50, Shí Zǐ Street, is an experiment by the Suzhou Municipal Construction Commission to address the conflict between preserving the ancient city's appearance and improving living conditions, which has been affirmed by the Ministry of Construction and domestic and foreign peers.

    Producing buildings as products is not difficult, but turning creative ideas into works that balance artistry and practicality is not easy. Engineer Jīn Jiā Jùn of the Suzhou Old City Renovation Office said: The appearance of the deep courtyard at No. 50, Shí Zǐ Street, has been preserved, and the living quality has been improved, but there are still some technical issues such as ventilation and lighting that need to be improved. The uniqueness of this courtyard lies in the fact that the residents belong to the same unit, making organizational and financial issues easier to resolve. Therefore, there are certain limitations to promoting this experience.

    Jīn Jiā Jùn revealed: To the east of No. 50, Shí Zǐ Street, there is a small area of single-story residential buildings that are dilapidated and are planned to be demolished and rebuilt into two to three-story traditional Jiangnan-style residences as another experimental model.

        Both Stars Should Shine Brightly

    At the end of 1981, renowned figures such as Kuāng Yà Míng and Wú Liàng Píng criticized Suzhou for "destructive construction and constructive destruction" in the newspapers, drawing the attention of central leaders and causing a significant impact on the people of Suzhou.

    2,500 years ago, King Hé Lǔ of Wú commanded Wú Zǐ Xū to build the capital city. Although Suzhou has undergone wars and changes, it has always remained in its original location, maintaining the original updates and construction. The modern layout of parallel canals, green bricks, small tiles, small bridges, and flowing water through the homes in Suzhou, compared to the Song Dynasty artifact "Píng Jiāng Tú," is almost identical, making it a unique example in the history of ancient city architecture. "Jiāngnán gardens are the best in the world, and Suzhou gardens are the best in Jiāngnán." The 28 open gardens within Suzhou's ancient city are even more man-made and ingenious. These are precious legacies left by our ancestors, and it is our generation's responsibility to protect and carry them forward.

    The topic of protecting ancient cities is good, but it is difficult to execute. 60% of Suzhou's 400,000 square meters of traditional residences are dilapidated, with 240,000 square meters of dangerous buildings. The 9-meter-wide Dào Qián Street, which connects the new and old districts, was widened to 26 meters but is still congested. Moreover, the demolition of a 1,400-meter-long riverside street has been widely condemned both domestically and internationally. The Red Leaf Paper Factory inside the old city discharges 70 tons of pollutants daily, accounting for half of Suzhou's organic pollution. The small bridges and flowing water have become foul-smelling ditches, but eliminating the pollution requires 25 to 30 million yuan, and the funds are not available. Last year, Suzhou received 298,000 foreign tourists and 18 million domestic tourists. The largest garden, the Humble Administrator's Garden, has 70 acres of land, with an optimal daily capacity of 5,000 to 6,000 people, but it actually receives more than 35,000 people. There is no more tranquility or leisure to be found. It is no wonder that the saying "Not visiting Suzhou is a lifelong regret, but visiting Suzhou is a regret for life" has spread.

    Old scholars like Kuāng Yà Míng and Wú Liàng Píng have called out: "Save Suzhou!"

    The thinking on protecting Suzhou's ancient city has gradually become clear. Since 1978, urban planning has been underway, with 13 revisions and 8 years of debate. Initially, it leaned towards the point, line, and surface protection model of ancient cities like Beijing, Xi'an, and Nanjing, which would give more flexibility to urban construction. However, under the unanimous request of many experts, the city's overall plan approved by the State Council in 1986 finally determined the construction policy of "comprehensively protecting Suzhou's ancient city appearance and focusing on building a modernized new district." Suzhou's ancient city is smaller and has a more complete appearance, making it easier to manage. In the future, the old district will be a "fake mountain, fake water, garden within the city"; the new district, surrounded by Shī Zǐ Mountain and Hé Shān, with Xiū Jiāng and the Grand Canal flowing through it, will become a "real mountain, real water, garden within the city."

    Deputy Director of the Municipal Construction Commission, Zhōu Zhì Fāng, said: This is called the "double star model." However, one star cannot be bright while the other is dim. The Italian city of Venice uses the method of preserving the original appearance without any changes, which is not suitable for modern living, resulting in the departure of taxpayers and only 70,000 people remaining in the city. The city's functions have shrunk. Domestically, Luòyáng also adopts the method of building a new city while leaving the old city aside, but the renovation of the old city is slow, also resulting in shrinkage and desolation. The new district's commercial housing is much more expensive. Protecting the ancient city's appearance does not mean that even the toilets must be preserved. The ancient city is not a museum but a living city where people reside. Therefore, both the old and new districts of Suzhou should be bright stars.

    The issue of whether to demolish and rebuild old residences has always been a sensitive one. Suzhou has divided the old district into 54 neighborhoods, with the Chinese Academy of Urban Planning, Tongji University, Southeast University, and Suzhou City Construction and Environmental Protection Institute selecting 5 typical neighborhoods for renovation planning, working independently. The planning results, however, were surprisingly similar, with demolition and rebuilding accounting for 40%, and even more in some cases. The participants were originally all "conservationists" who opposed demolition and rebuilding, but they eventually reached conclusions that contradicted their own views, indicating that experts' thoughts in the past also had some detachment from reality. Firstly, preserving the original appearance would not pass with the locals, as they would not want to live with "three buckets" (toilet bucket, water bucket, bath bucket) for decades. The buildings themselves would also not pass, as according to Western postmodernist thought, ancient buildings should preserve their appearance while modernizing the interior. Western buildings are mostly made of granite walls, which are very sturdy, and can be modernized by changing the fireplace to gas and renovating. However, Chinese wooden structures are thin-walled, with a lifespan of generally 40 to 50 years. Suzhou's old houses that are 70 to 80 years old are not uncommon, and the wooden frames have long been rotten. Even if demolished, the recovery rate is almost zero.

    The renovated neighborhoods are more reasonable in terms of living, green spaces, and commercial layout. Residential buildings are three stories or lower, and commercial buildings do not exceed four stories. The shape remains that of traditional Jiangnan residences, preserving the appearance of green bricks, small tiles, small bridges, flowing water, and varying heights, while the interior facilities are "upgraded," allowing residents to enjoy the fruits of modern civilization.

    Only by enhancing the attractiveness of the 26-square-kilometer new district and making part of the old district's residents willing to move out can the pressure on the old city be relieved. Since 1978, residential areas such as Cǎi Xiāng and Sān Yuán have been built in the new district to the west of the old city, covering 4 million square meters and housing 90,000 people. A 27-hectare plot of land to the northwest of the Grand Canal is planned to be developed into a pollution-free, light-structure industrial park for technology and labor-intensive industries, allowing residents to work locally.

    The current "double stars," with the new district being relatively dim, show that the old district's population has the optimal capacity of 250,000 people, but it now has 350,000 people. By the year 2000, 100,000 people must be relocated. Currently, departments such as labor, public security, personnel, and the retired cadres bureau all have the authority to recruit people, adding 15,000 people per year, far exceeding the new district's development speed of 0.5 to 0.6 square kilometers per year. If the new district's construction does not progress, the old city cannot be preserved. Without a relaxed population environment in the old city, renovation and reconstruction can only be discussed on paper.

            The Expectations of Suzhou People

    Wearing the hats of "Historical and Cultural City" and "Scenic Tourism City," Suzhou has more responsibilities than others, but it does not have the corresponding means to achieve the goals. The state's new industrial projects are invested in Wuxi and Changzhou, but not in Suzhou; tourists departing from Shanghai in the morning for a day trip to Suzhou, the economic benefits go to others, and Suzhou only gets a few cents from the ticket and the garbage and waste left by the tourists. The investment in tourism infrastructure is huge. In 1983, the Shí Hú scenic area returned 2,000 acres of land to the lake, spending 5 million yuan. Since 1981, 84 severely polluting factories have been relocated from the old city, and according to 1987 prices, each factory requires an average of 300 million yuan. There are still 200 factories inside the city, and now it is no longer possible to relocate them. There are many places that need money, and building a bridge over the canal costs 10 million yuan. The infrastructure is seriously insufficient, with the water plant's daily water supply capacity being 250,000 tons, but the actual supply is 340,000 tons, all of which are being supplied by overstraining the equipment.

    The wheel of renovating old city residences is also difficult to start. Technically, each neighborhood needs to be considered in three dimensions, front and back, left and right, up and down, inside and outside, and must have a varied height, white walls, black tiles, small bridges, and flowing water appearance. The layout of the nine pipelines into the alleys and homes, and the direction of the water pipes for flush toilets, are all new topics. In terms of funding, roughly calculating, renovating one neighborhood requires 200 to 300 million yuan, and 54 neighborhoods require more than 10 billion yuan. The number of floors cannot exceed three, and the funds cannot be turned over by themselves.

    Deputy Director of the Construction Commission, Zhōu Zhì Fāng, said: Héféi and Hā'ěr Bīn use the "heightening" method of developing space, turning two-story buildings into ten-story buildings, and the funds can be balanced with a surplus; Japan relies on high technology and huge funds to develop underground. These are not feasible for Suzhou. So, where is the way out for Suzhou to renovate residential funds?

    First, the vacancy rate. If "demolish one, build three" is not achieved, demolishing one and building one point a few is still possible. No. 50, Shí Zǐ Street, has increased the usable area by a little. Second, the price difference in the area. Residential housing is 800 yuan per square meter, while commercial housing can reach 1,200 to 1,500 yuan per square meter. The Chāng Mén Wài Shí Lù area, as recorded in "Dream of the Red Chamber," was the most prosperous area in Suzhou at that time, and can be developed into the second commercial center. The residences there are dilapidated, low, and short, and can achieve demolishing one and building three point two. Third, high-end housing. There are many cultural relics near Suzhou University, and the environment is tranquil, making it suitable for building high-end residences for high-level intellectuals, retired cadres, overseas Chinese, and Taiwanese compatriots. Fourth, attracting foreign investment. The United States, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are all interested in Suzhou's real estate industry. A professor from Hiroshima University in Japan wants to build a residential museum in Suzhou, and a Hong Kong businessman has discussed building a garden-style restaurant. Low-interest loans from abroad are also being considered.

    Preserving the ancient city's appearance is difficult, but it is not impossible. A famous person once said: We are here to solve these problems. Solving the problem of protecting the ancient city's appearance under the conditions of urban modernization is risky, but it is indeed a good thing to be responsible to history and benefit future generations, and it also provides an excellent opportunity for far-sighted and ambitious architectural masters. Deputy Director Zhōu Zhì Fāng quietly told the reporter: Those experts are all planning and designing at a loss.

    千年一脉的苏州古城受到现代生活浪潮的挑战河街并行，青砖小瓦，小桥流水人家……
    寻找传统与现代化交汇点新华社记者  卜云彤  王兆麟
        一次寻求合理性的试验
    最近，苏州十梓街50号的项人元和他的8户邻居搬回了修葺一新的旧居。项人元对于改造后的古老院落增加了独用的厨房、卫生间，又有公共活动空间感到很满意。
    这是一套苏南古色古香的四进深宅大院，有1000平方米，住着苏州医学院附属医院的19户职工。项人元原来住着40多平方米的一个大房间，孩子大了，厕所离家300多米，感到极不方便。改造后的50号大院，保留了深宅大院的古建筑外观造型，内部又实现了现代化，经济上也是可行的，一平方米仅用150元。
    十梓街50号改造项目是苏州市建委处理保持古城风貌与改善居住条件矛盾的一次试验，受到建设部和国内外同行的肯定。
    把建筑作为产品来生产并不困难，要把创作构思变成艺术性与功利性兼顾的作品却不是一件容易的事。苏州旧城改造办公室金家骏工程师说：十梓街50号深宅大院的风貌保持下来了，居住质量有所提高，但通风、采光等某些技术问题还有待改进。这个大院的特殊之处在于居民属于同一个单位，组织、资金问题比较好解决。所以，要想推广这个经验还有一定的局限性。
    金家骏透露：十梓街50号东邻有一小片一层的居民区，房屋破败，准备推倒重建二至三层的传统江南民居，作为另外一类试验模式。
      两颗星都应该是明亮的
    1981年底，匡亚明、吴亮平等知名人士在报上批评苏州搞
  “破坏性建设、建设性破坏”，引起中央领导同志重视，对苏州人也产生不小震动。
    2500年前，吴王阖闾命伍子胥修筑都城，以后苏州城虽历经战乱、变迁，始终没有挪窝，保持原地更新、建设。近代苏州河街并行的双棋盘格局、青砖小瓦、小桥流水人家的风貌，与宋代文物《平江图》对照，竟然相差无几，堪称古城建筑史一绝。“江南园林甲天下，苏州园林甲江南”。苏州古城内开放的28处园林，更是人造自然，巧夺天工。这些都是祖先留下的不可多得的珍贵遗产，保护、发扬是我们这一代不可推卸的责任。
    保护古城的文章题目虽好，却难做。苏州400多万平方米的传统民居有60％破烂不堪，危房达24万平方米。连接新区、老城的道前街仅有9米宽，虽然拓宽成26米，仍然拥挤堵塞，而且因为拆除一条1400多米长的临河街道，受到海内外一致谴责。旧城内的红叶造纸厂每天排污70吨，占苏州有机污染一半，小桥流水成了污气熏人的臭水沟，但根治污染需要2500至3000万元，资金没有着落。去年苏州国外游人29.8万，国内1800万，最大的园林——拙政园有70多亩地，一天最佳容量是5000至6000人，可实际接待35000人以上，还有什么幽静清新、闲情逸致可言。难怪流传着“不到苏州终身遗憾，到了苏州遗憾终身”的说法。
    匡亚明、吴亮平等老先生大声疾呼：“救救苏州”！
    保护苏州古城的思路是逐步明朗的。1978年开始搞城建规划，易稿13次，反复争论8年，原先是向北京、西安、南京等古城点、线、面保护的模式倾斜的，这样城市建设机动余地大一些。但在许多专家一致要求下，1986年国务院批复的城市总体规划最后确定了“全面保护苏州古城风貌，重点建设现代化新区”的建设方针。苏州古城毕竟小点，风貌完整，好办些。以后老城区是“假山假水城中园”；新区有狮子山、何山环抱，胥江、大运河流贯，成为“真山真水园中城”。
    市建委主任周志方说：这叫“双星模式”。但是不能一个星亮，一个星暗。意大利威尼斯水城采用原封不动的保护方法，不适合现代人居住，结果纳税人都跑了，城里仅剩7万人。城市功能萎缩。国内洛阳也是采取撇开老城建新城的办法，可老城的改造缓慢，也出现萎缩、萧条景象，新区商品房贵出许多。保护古城风貌，不是说连马桶也得保护下来。古城不是博物馆，而是有人居住的活生生的城市。所以，苏州老城新区两颗星都应该是明亮的。
    老的民居要不要大拆大建，向来是一个敏感问题。苏州把老城区划分出54个街坊，由中国城市规划院、同济大学、东南大学、苏州城建环保学院等单位选择5个典型街坊进行改造规划，分头独立工作。规划结果却惊人相同，大拆大建占40％，甚至更多。参加工作的原来都是反对拆建、主张不动的“保护派”，最后却得出与自己观点相悖的结论，看来过去专家的思想也有脱离实际之处。首先，原封不动，老百姓那里通不过，他们不愿意几十年后仍然守着“三桶”（马桶、水桶、洗澡桶）过日子。房子本身也通不过，按照西方后现代主义思想，古老建筑保持外貌，里面现代化。西方建筑大都是花岗岩墙面，非常坚固，把壁炉改为煤气，装修一下就行了。而中国的土木结构民居墙体单薄，寿命一般四五十年。苏州旧房七八十年的都不在少数，木头骨架早被蛀烂了。即使拆掉，回收率已几乎等于零了。
    更新后的街坊在居住、绿地、商业布局上更加合理。民居三层以下，商业房不超过四层。造型依然是传统的江南民居，保持青砖小瓦、小桥流水、高低错落的风貌，而室内设施“鸟枪换炮”，现代文明的成果尽可以享受。
    只有增强新区26平方公里的吸引力，使老区的一部分居民乐意搬出去，才可以缓解老城的压力。1978年以来，老城外西边的新区已建设起彩香、三元等居住小区，面积达400万平方米，居住9万人，还将兴建一批科研、教育、文化、卫生设施。相距不远的运河西北一块27公顷的土地计划建设一个无污染、轻型结构的技术、劳动密集型工业小区，以使居民就地就业。
    现在的“双星”，新区那一颗目前还比较暗淡。苏州城建环保学院在一号街坊调查显示：有80％以上居民希望能在原地段居住下去，不愿意搬迁它处。老式民居层楼低，外面热闹，里面安静，老年人习惯了周围的环境，留恋街坊邻里的情谊，不愿挪动。刚结婚的年轻夫妇只要有抽水马桶、浴缸、煤气，倒不嫌路远，愿意住在新区，可生了孩子又想回来，在老城和父母在一起，互相照顾方便一些。老城幼儿园、学校的设施、教学质量也更好一些。甚至连彩香新村商业网点，国营部门都不愿接手，交由街道经营管理。
    老城的人口最佳容量25万人，现已有35万人，到2000年必须迁出10万人。现在劳动、公安、人事、老干局都有进人权，每年增加1.5万人，远远超过新区每年0.5至0.6平方公里的开发速度。新区建设上不去，老城便保不下来。老城没有宽松的人口环境，更新、改造也只能纸上谈兵。
            苏州人的期待
    戴上“历史文化名城、风景旅游城市”两顶帽子，责任比别人多了，可并没有实现目标的相应手段。国家的新建工业项目往无锡、常州投放，苏州没份；游人清晨从上海出发到苏州一日游，经济效益大头被别人得了，苏州只得了几毛钱门票和游人留下的垃圾、粪便。而旅游基础设施的投资是巨大的。1983年，石湖景区退田还湖2000亩，花掉500万元。1981年以来，迁掉老城84家污染严重的工厂，按1987年价格计算，平均每厂需要300多万元。城内还有两百家工厂，现在再也迁不起了。花钱的地方还很多，运河上架一座桥就用1000万元。基础设施严重不足，水厂日供水能力25万吨，可实际供水34万吨，都是在咬着牙拚设备。
    改造老城民居的车轮也难以启动。从技术上说，每一街坊的立体考虑，前后左右，上下内外，还要具有高低错落、粉墙黛瓦、小桥流水风貌。九种管线如何进巷入户，抽水马桶的线路走向，都是新的课题。从资金上说，粗粗计算一下，改造一个街坊需要2000至3000万元，54个街坊需要10多个亿。层数不得突破三层，资金自身很难周转。
    建委主任周志方说：合肥、哈尔滨采取开发空间的“拔高”办法，两层房改建十层房，资金可以平衡有余；日本依仗高科技、巨额资金开发地下。这些苏州都行不通。那么，苏州改造居民资金的出路在哪里呢？
    一曰余房率。达不到“拆一建三”，拆一建一点几还是可以的。十梓街50号就增加了一点使用面积。二曰地段差价。居民房800元一平方米，商业房可达1200至1500元一平方米。阊门外石路地区，《红楼梦》记载是苏州当时的第一等繁华地带，可开发为第二商业中心。那里的民居破、低、矮，可以达到拆一建三点二。三曰高级住房。苏州大学附近文物点多，环境幽雅，可兴建高级住宅，供高级知识分子、离休干部、归国华侨、台胞使用。四曰引进外资。美、日、港、台对苏州房地产业都有兴趣。日本广岛大学一位教授想在苏州搞民居博物馆，香港商人已洽谈建园林式餐馆。向国外低息贷款也在考虑中。
    保持古城风貌很难，但也绝非无可作为。一位名人有句名言：我们就是为了解决这些难题才来到这个世界上的。解决城市现代化条件下古城风貌保护的问题，风险很大，但确实又是一件向历史负责、造福子孙的好事，也为有远见、有志向的建筑大师们提供了绝好的用武之地。周志方主任悄悄告诉记者：那些专家们都在赔着本儿搞规划和设计哩。
