    The relevant supervisory and law enforcement departments in Sichuan Province have dared to uphold principles, resist the trend of intercession, enforce the law impartially, and actively investigate and punish officials involved in corruption, achieving good results.

    It is understood that so far this year, the Sichuan Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission has investigated and handled 2,893 cases, with 1,716 cases already concluded. A total of 1,521 people have been disciplined, 354 have been expelled from the Party, and some cases have been transferred to judicial authorities for further investigation. Among the cases currently under investigation, nearly 20 are involving officials at the provincial and municipal levels, with 10 formally investigated.

    Sichuan's relevant departments have adhered to the principle of equality before the law, focusing on investigating major cases. The Deyang City car control violation case, which has a wide impact, was directly addressed by the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government leaders. A joint investigation team was organized at the provincial and municipal levels, with the support of the Deyang City Party Committee and Municipal Government, to investigate the case for over half a year. It was found that from January to October 1988, the city had illegally acquired and illegally approved the registration of 261 small cars. Some officials engaged in illegal resale for profit, bribery, extortion, and personal enrichment. During the investigation, some people sought intercession from the provincial and municipal leaders, requesting leniency in the confiscation of illegally registered cars and lighter penalties. The provincial and municipal leaders clearly stated: "Investigate the facts and handle the case strictly according to relevant policies. Confiscate what should be confiscated, discipline what should be disciplined, and prosecute what should be prosecuted." Currently, 83 cars have been confiscated, 148 cars have been fined, and 15 officials at various levels have been arrested, detained, or disciplined.

    The main responsible person of Sichuan Xin Guang Industrial Import and Export Company, without consultation, signed a contract with Hong Kong businessman Hong Chaohui (who was sentenced in Hong Kong for fraud) to jointly establish Shu Hui Company, resulting in the loss of a large amount of Hong Kong dollars. Additionally, this person falsely reported registered capital and the number of employees to obtain a travel agency license, entrusting the travel agency to an unreliable person, causing an economic loss of nearly 3 million yuan. Furthermore, this person recklessly signed contracts with foreign "suitcase traders" and set up production points for exporting parts, resulting in severe product backlog. The interest on occupied funds and warehouse storage fees alone amounted to a loss of over 600,000 yuan. The serious dereliction of duty by the main responsible person of Xin Guang Company has sparked widespread criticism among the masses. During the investigation of this case by the Sichuan Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, there were still people interceding on behalf of the responsible person, attempting to downplay the severity of the case. The commission's staff overcame the interference and finally clarified the above facts. The case is currently being seriously handled.

    顶住说情歪风　执法不徇私情
    四川严查官倒力惩腐败
    本报成都7月10日电　记者罗茂城报道：四川省有关监督执法部门敢于坚持原则，顶住说情风，执法不徇私情，积极查处官倒、惩治腐败，取得了良好的成绩。
    据了解，到目前为止，今年仅四川省纪委系统就立案查处各类案件达2893件，已结案1716件，共有1521人受到党纪政纪处分，354人被开除了党籍，有的案件已移送司法部门进一步查处。正在查处的案件中，涉及地厅级的干部近20人，其中正式立案审查的10人。
    四川有关部门坚持在法律面前人人平等的原则，集中精力查处大案要案。牵涉面广、影响较大的德阳市汽车违控案件，四川省委、省政府领导直接过问，专门组织了省、市联合调查组，在德阳市委、市府的大力支持下，历时半年多，终于查明该市从1988年元月至10月，违控购买和非法签批上户的小汽车达261辆，有的干部从中进行倒卖牟利，索贿受贿，敲诈勒索，中饱私囊。在查处过程中，有的人找省委、省政府领导说情，要求对违控上户的汽车少没收一点，处理宽容一点。省委、省政府领导明确答复：查清事实，按照有关政策严肃处理，该没收的没收，该处分的处分，该法办的法办。目前，已没收了小车83辆，处以罚款的小车148辆，被逮捕、收审和受到党纪政纪处分的各级干部共15人。
    群众关注、议论较多的四川新光工业进出口公司主要负责人，未经咨询就与港商洪朝辉（此人在香港因串骗已判刑）签约合办蜀辉公司，造成中方巨额股金被洪挪用，使333万港元至今无法收回。同时，此人还签字虚报注册资金和从业人数，办理旅游公司执照，把旅游公司委托给社会上不可靠的人去经营，造成近300万元的经济损失。此外，还盲目与外国皮包商签约并布点生产出口零件，造成产品严重积压，仅占用资金利息、仓储费损失就达60多万元。对新光公司主要负责人的严重失职行为，广大干部群众意见很大。四川省纪委在查处该案时，仍不断有人为其说情，企图大事化小，小事化了。省纪委的同志力排干扰，终于查清了以上事实，目前正在严肃处理。
