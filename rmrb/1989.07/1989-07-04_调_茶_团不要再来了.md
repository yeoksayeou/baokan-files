No More Tea Inspection Teams

As soon as the tea leaves hit the market, various inspection teams flock to our county's tea-producing villages such as Longwangya, Taiping, Zhongfeng, Huibai, Yangjiaji, and Tianbao. Today, one team leaves, and tomorrow another arrives, leaving us overwhelmed. Before these inspection team members depart, they always insist on buying a few kilograms of the finest tea. The market price for the first-grade Maojian tea is 28 to 32 yuan per kilogram, but these inspection team members can buy a kilogram for just a few yuan, and some even take it for free. One village-run tea factory had over 10 kilograms of tea taken away for free, leaving the tea farmers in a miserable situation.

Our county is famous for its green tea, and the production process is strict. Farmers sweat a lot to produce each kilogram of green tea. This practice of using inspections as an excuse to buy tea at low prices from farmers not only disrupts normal production but also increases the burden on the farmers. We hope that these tea inspection teams will stop coming, as they are not welcome by the farmers.

### 调“茶”团不要再来了

    调“茶”团不要再来了
    茶叶刚刚上市，各种调查团纷纷来到我县龙王垭、太平、中峰、汇湾、杨家机、天宝等茶乡。今天这个调查团刚走，明天那个调查团又来，令人应接不暇。这些调查团成员临走时，都要买几公斤上好的茶叶。按市场价格，头道毛尖茶价格每公斤28至32元，而这些调查团成员只用几元钱就可以买走1公斤毛尖茶，有的甚至白拿。有一个村办茶场有10多公斤茶叶被白白拿走，茶农叫苦不迭。
    我县盛产绿茶，绿茶制作工艺要求严格，茶农每制1公斤绿茶要流许多汗水。像这样以调查为名，从茶农手中低价买走茶叶的做法，不仅干扰了正常的生产秩序，还加重了茶农的负担。希望这类调“茶”团不要再来了，因为你们不受茶农欢迎。
