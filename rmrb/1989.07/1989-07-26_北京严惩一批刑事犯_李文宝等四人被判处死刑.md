    Beijing Severely Punishes a Batch of Criminals
    Li Wenbao and Four Others Sentenced to Death

    BEIJING, July 26 (Xinhua) — During the turmoil and riots in Beijing, criminals Li Wenbao and Liang Hongchen took advantage of the chaos. Today, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court sentenced them to death and stripped them of their political rights for life.

    Li Wenbao is a farmer from Shunyi County, Beijing, and Liang Hongchen is a farmer from the suburbs of Shenyang. On the early morning of June 2, Li and Liang broke into a residential building in Shunyi County and stole three bicycles. They then proceeded to the Jingmi Road in Shunyi County, where they stopped three passing farmers and robbed them of over 300 yuan.

    On the early morning of June 4, Li Wenbao and Liang Hongchen scaled the wall into the home of farmer Xu Changjiu in the border area between Sanhe County, Hebei, and Jixian County, Tianjin. They held a kitchen knife and robbed over 800 yuan, along with a watch and a calculator. At midnight on June 5, they impersonated traffic police on the Liushuipo Road in Shunyi County, stopping a driver named Yue Chunliang in a "Beijing 130" type vehicle. They beat Yue Chunliang severely with iron rods and other weapons, leaving him with serious injuries, and then stole his car, valued at 11,000 yuan.

    At today's public sentencing, the Beijing Intermediate People's Court also severely punished Mao Guorui and four other criminals who committed crimes in multiple locations. This gang of criminals traveled from Beijing to other provinces last May, abducted a young woman, sexually assaulted her, and then brutally murdered her, hiding the body to cover their tracks. They also stole a large amount of public and private property. Two of them were sentenced to death, one to death with a two-year reprieve, and one to life imprisonment, all stripped of their political rights for life.

    本报北京7月26日讯　在北京发生动乱和暴乱期间，歹徒李文宝、梁洪臣趁火打劫，今天被北京市中级人民法院判处死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    李文宝是北京顺义县农民，梁洪臣是沈阳郊区农民。6月2日凌晨，李、梁2人窜至顺义县城一居民楼盗窃自行车3辆，然后又在顺义县京密公路上，先后拦劫3名过路农民，抢劫人民币300余元。
    6月4日凌晨，李文宝、梁洪臣还在河北三河县与天津蓟县交界处，翻墙潜入农民徐长久家中，持菜刀抢走人民币800余元及手表、计算器等物。6月5日零时，他俩又在顺义县两顺坡公路上，冒充执勤的交通民警，将驾驶“北京130”型汽车的岳春良截住，用铁棍等器械将岳春良打成重伤，而后抢走其驾驶的汽车，价值1.1万元。
    在今天的公开宣判会上，北京市中级人民法院还依法严惩了毛国富等4名流窜作案犯罪分子，这伙歹徒去年5月由北京流窜到外地，挟持1名女青年进行侮辱，并用残暴手段将其杀害，掩尸灭迹，还曾盗窃巨额公私财物。他们当中2人被判死刑，1人被判死缓，1人被判无期徒刑，均被剥夺政治权利终身。
