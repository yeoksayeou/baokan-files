Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th.

A bronze Buddha statue symbolizing Sino-Thai friendship was handed over today by Thai Ambassador to China, Dej Bunnag, representing the Thai government and Buddhists, to the Chinese government and Buddhists.

The statue, named "Vasana Phumani" (meaning the Buddha of Merit), weighs 1.6 tons and stands 3.5 meters tall. The handover ceremony was held at the Lingguang Temple in the western suburbs of Beijing, where the statue is housed.

The former Thai Sangharaja (Supreme Patriarch) Vasana Vadhana Mahathera had planned to donate a Buddha statue to China. His name's abbreviation is inscribed on the base of the statue.

The bronze Buddha statue is modeled after the style of Buddha statues from the Sukhothai Kingdom, the first unified kingdom of Thailand.

At the handover ceremony, the Thai Ambassador said that the statue is a "bond and talisman of friendship between the peoples of Thailand and China."

The Thai businessman who funded the casting of the statue, Mr. Bhummapon Thong, referred to it as a "symbol of prosperity and happiness for the peoples of both countries."

During the ceremony, the secretary of the former Thai Sangharaja and the abbot of Wat Ratchabophit, Phra Sri Ratana Sutthi, also presented to the Chinese Buddhist community the main Buddha statue and offerings used in the cremation ceremony of the Sangharaja.

Chairman Zhao Puxu of the Chinese Buddhist Association and over 100 Buddhist figures from Beijing attended the handover ceremony.
