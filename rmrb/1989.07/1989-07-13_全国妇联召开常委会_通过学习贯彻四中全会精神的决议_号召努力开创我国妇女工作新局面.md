The All-China Women's Federation held its Sixth Plenary Session of the Third Standing Committee in Beijing today, calling on women nationwide to implement the tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and to make new contributions to creating a new situation in women's work in China.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and President of the All-China Women's Federation, Chen Mu Hua, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. She said that to achieve a thorough victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counterrevolutionary riot, we must mobilize the broad masses of women to actively cooperate with relevant departments, further fully expose the conspiracies of a few people to create turmoil and riot, and thoroughly eliminate all hidden dangers that affect social stability. For young students and the masses who have made some mistakes due to lack of understanding, as parents and mothers, we should use our unique influence to patiently and meticulously help them reflect, change their stance, summarize lessons, and raise their awareness. Through our efforts, we will fully maintain the overall stability of society.

The meeting held that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has extremely important practical significance and far-reaching historical significance. The Women's Federation, as a "bridge" and "bond" between the Party and women of all nationalities and all walks of life, should play its role in implementing the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session. Organize Women's Federation cadres and the broad masses of women to seriously study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session and the important speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping; mobilize women to contribute to the thorough suppression of the counterrevolutionary riot and the stabilization of the situation; strengthen ideological and political work, resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization; mobilize women to work hard and make dedicated contributions in the rectification and rectification; mobilize women to actively participate in the anti-corruption struggle, assist the Party and the government in promoting clean governance; continue to carry out the "Love, Support, and Learn from the People's Liberation Army" activities; strengthen exchanges and contacts with women's organizations overseas and abroad, and strive to implement the policy of opening up to the outside world; strengthen the construction of the Women's Federation itself.
