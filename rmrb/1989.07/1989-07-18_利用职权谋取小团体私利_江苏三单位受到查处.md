    Abusing Authority to Seek Private Gains for Small Groups
    Three Units in Jiangsu Province Punished

    Reporter Geng Yongquan reports from Nanjing: While investigating individual cases of disciplinary violations, the supervisory authorities in Jiangsu Province have also focused on cases where departments abuse their authority to seek private gains for small groups.

    Last December, the Wuxi Municipal Housing Management Bureau entrusted the Wuxi Branch of the Bank of Communications to lend out funds from its special accounts and funds for purchasing commercial housing. At the same time, it proposed to supply each staff member of the bureau with a subsidized color television set. In January this year, the Wuxi Branch of the Bank of Communications signed a loan contract worth 700,000 yuan with the Jiangyin Cold-Rolled Thin Plate Factory. The factory purchased 90 units of 18-inch color televisions at a negotiated price and sold them to the Wuxi Municipal Housing Management Bureau and the Wuxi Branch of the Bank of Communications at subsidized prices, totaling a subsidy of 103,800 yuan.

    The Nanjing Wood Materials Transfer Station of the Jiangsu Wood Materials Company supplied 6,011 cubic meters of imported Douglas fir to the Liuhe County Supply and Marketing Cooperative Joint Venture Company and the Local Products Company at a price 130 yuan per cubic meter lower than the market price. These two companies then purchased the wood at negotiated prices and supplied 100 units of Wanbao refrigerators and 450 color televisions to the station at subsidized prices. The station also supplied 3,995 cubic meters of imported Douglas fir to the Wujin County Wood Materials Company at a preferential price, in exchange for 210 color televisions and 640 branded bicycles. According to the investigation, the total price difference for the color televisions, refrigerators, and bicycles sold to the Nanjing Wood Materials Transfer Station by these three units amounted to over 400,000 yuan.

    A few years ago, the Wuxi Branch of the Bank of China lent 800,000 US dollars to the Wuxi Municipal Radio Components Factory No. 2. When the loan was repaid this spring, it was settled at an exchange rate lower than the state's official rate. In appreciation, the factory sent 13,000 yuan worth of woolen fabric to the bank.

    The supervisory authorities believe that such behavior, which abuses authority to seek private gains for small groups, often disguises itself as "caring for the people's livelihood," legalizing illegal acts and having a greater corrosive effect. The above cases are currently being handled by the relevant departments.

    利用职权谋取小团体私利
    江苏三单位受到查处
    本报南京7月18日电　记者龚永泉报道：江苏省监察机关在查处个人违纪案件的同时，注意查处部门利用职权为小团体谋取私利的案件。
    去年底，无锡市房管局委托交通银行无锡支行，将帐上的专款资金和代购商品房建房款放贷，同时提出要为局机关工作人员每人供应一台平价彩电。今年1月，交通银行无锡支行与江阴冷轧薄板厂签订了70万元的借款合同，该厂议价购进18英寸彩电90台，以平价卖给市房管局和交通银行无锡支行，共补贴差价10.38万元。
    江苏省木材公司南京木材转运站将进口的花旗松6011立方米，以每立方米低于市场价130元的价格供应给六合县供销社联营公司、土产公司。这两个公司则以议价购进，平价向该站提供100台万宝电冰箱和450台彩电。该站还向吴江县木材公司“优惠价”提供进口花旗松3995立方米，得到对方供应的彩电210台、名牌自行车640辆。据查，这三个单位销售给南京木材转运站的彩电、冰箱和自行车中，共付差价款40多万元。
    中国银行无锡分行几年前向市无线电元件二厂贷款80万美元，今年春节收回贷款时按低于国家牌价的汇率结算。元件二厂为表“谢意”，送给该行价值1.3万元的呢料。
    监察部门认为，这类利用职权为小团体谋取私利的行为，往往打着“关心群众生活”的幌子，使违法行为合法化，具有更大的腐蚀性。以上案件正责成有关部门抓紧处理。
