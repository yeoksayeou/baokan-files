The Metropolitan Police Department in Japan began distributing this year's anti-abduction propaganda posters on June 28. This year's poster, created by a manga artist, depicts a big bad wolf holding a life preserver and ice cream, trying to lure a child. The text on the poster reads: "Teach children not to go with strangers."

There is a reason for the distribution of such posters. Since last year, there have been multiple child abduction cases. In Saitama Prefecture alone, three cases occurred in the latter half of last year. On June 6 of this year, a child went missing in the Koto Ward of Tokyo. All the abducted children were girls, aged between 4 and 7. The bodies of two of the children were found after they were killed. The police have mobilized numerous officers to investigate the cases, but the culprit remains at large. The culprit occasionally changes locations to send "statements" to newspapers, openly challenging public opinion and the police. Who the culprit is and what their motive is remain unknown. People are astonished that in a society like Japan, which is wealthy, has advanced education, and values etiquette, there could be such inhumane "big bad wolves."

This year, the Metropolitan Police Department printed 20,000 more posters than in previous years, posting them in bustling streets, residential areas where children gather, parks, kindergartens, and elementary schools. They urge people: "Beware of the big bad wolf."

    拐骗儿童案件屡屡发生  日警方呼吁“警惕大灰狼”
    本报东京电　日本警视厅从6月28日开始发行本年度防范宣传画。今年的宣传画出自漫画家之手：一只大灰狼手拿游泳圈和冰激凌在哄骗孩子……画边文字写着：“教育孩子不要跟陌生人走”。
    发行这类宣传画事出有因。从去年以来，拐骗儿童案件多次发生。仅在埼玉县境内，去年下半年就接连发生三起。今年6月6日，东京都江东区又有一名儿童失踪。被拐骗的全是女孩，年龄从4岁到7岁不等，已发现其中2名儿童被杀后的尸体。警视厅调集众多警察参加破案，至今凶手仍未落网。凶手还不时变换地点向报纸发出“声明”等，公然向舆论和警方挑战。凶手是谁，动机何在，仍无线索。人们不可思议，在生活富裕、教育发达、崇尚礼仪的日本社会中，竟有如此惨无人道的“大灰狼”。
    今年，警视厅比历年增印2万张宣传画，张贴在繁华街道、儿童聚集的住宅区、公园、幼儿园和小学校，向人们呼吁：“警惕大灰狼。”
