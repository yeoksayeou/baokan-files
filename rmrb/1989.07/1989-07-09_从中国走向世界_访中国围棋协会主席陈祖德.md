From China to the World

— Interview with Chen Zude, Chairman of the Chinese Weiqi Association

(Part 1)

Arriving at the southernmost tip of Hainan Island, in the city of Sanya known as the "End of the Earth and Edge of the Sea," to engage in a game of weiqi by the boundless blue sea, one cannot help but think about how this ancient cultural heritage of our Chinese nation can go global.

Chen Zude, the chairman of the Chinese Weiqi Association, is the chief referee of the Name Brand Tournament. At this time and place, it is most fitting for him to discuss this issue.

Chen Zude said, looking domestically, in recent years the weiqi craze has swept across the nation. According to colleagues from CCTV, whether in terms of match broadcasts or special lectures, weiqi has consistently ranked among the top in sports programs, with high viewership rates.

Globally, when the first World Amateur Weiqi Championship was held in 1979, only 15 countries and regions participated. By the 1989 11th World Amateur Weiqi Championship, this had expanded to 38 countries and regions. Currently, except for Africa, all other continents have various weiqi competitions and organizations. Europe holds an annual European Championship, which was previously limited to Western Europe. In recent years, the development of weiqi in Eastern Europe has been very rapid. Just in the Soviet Union, there are over 50,000 weiqi enthusiasts. In 1978, when he and Nie Weiping first visited Europe, playing against European players required giving them a 5 to 6, even 8 to 9 stone handicap. Now, a Dutch player playing against a Chinese player only needs to give the first move. This shows how quickly the level of European players has improved.

Additionally, exchanges between weiqi associations of various countries and regions and the Chinese Weiqi Association have become more frequent. In May of this year, the secretary-general of the European Weiqi Federation proposed the request for the Chinese Weiqi Association to send outstanding players to Europe for long-term coaching.

Chen Zude mentioned that 10 years ago during his visit to Europe, many Europeans did not even know that weiqi originated in China. The rules they used for competitions were mostly Japanese rules. In fact, the rules used in China are more scientifically calculated. Japan and South Korea have done a lot of work. As the birthplace of weiqi, the Chinese Weiqi Association has the responsibility to do more work, introducing weiqi to the people of various countries. Now, the English version of the Chinese Weiqi rules has been published and distributed to weiqi associations in various countries.

Additionally, starting from last year, there have been world-class tournaments with professional players participating, such as the Ing Cup and the Fujitsu Cup. All of these indicate that the prospects for weiqi going global are very promising.

    从中国走向世界
    ——访中国围棋协会主席陈祖德
    （一）
    来到海南岛的最南端，在有“天涯海角”之称的三亚市纹枰手谈，面对一望无际的蔚蓝色大海，使人不禁想到了围棋——我们中华民族这一古老的文化遗产，如何走向世界的问题。
    中国围棋协会主席陈祖德是名人战的裁判长，此时此地，由他来谈这个问题，是最合适不过的了。
    陈祖德说，从国内来看，近几年围棋热波及全国，据中央电视台的同志告诉他，无论从比赛实况还是专题讲座，围棋在体育节目中都在前几名之列，收视率也十分高。
    从世界范围来看，1979年举办第一届世界业余围棋锦标赛时只有15个国家和地区的选手，至1989年第11届世界业余围棋锦标赛，已扩展到38个国家和地区。目前除了非洲以外，其余各大洲均有各种围棋比赛和组织。欧洲年年都有欧洲锦标赛，过去只限于西欧，近几年，围棋运动在东欧的发展势头也十分迅速，仅苏联，就有5万多名围棋爱好者。1978年，他和聂卫平第一次出访欧洲时，与欧洲棋手下棋，要让5、6个甚至8、9个子，而现在一位荷兰棋手与中国选手下，我们只能让先，这说明欧洲棋手的水平提高得十分快。
    此外，各个国家和地区的围棋协会与中国围棋协会的交往也越来越多，今年5月，欧洲围棋联盟秘书长提出了请中国围棋协会选派优秀棋手到欧洲长期去辅导棋艺的要求。
    陈祖德讲，10年前他访欧时，许多欧洲人甚至不知道围棋起源于中国，他们比赛采用的规则大都是日本规则，实际上，中国的比赛规则，计算得更科学一些。日本和南朝鲜做了不少工作。作为围棋运动的发祥地，中国围棋协会有责任去做更多的工作，把围棋介绍给各国人民。如今，英文版的中国围棋规则已经出版，并且分送给各国围棋协会。
    此外，从去年起，开始有了职业棋手参加的世界性大赛——应氏杯和富士通杯，以上这些，都说明了围棋运动走向世界的前景是十分美好的。
