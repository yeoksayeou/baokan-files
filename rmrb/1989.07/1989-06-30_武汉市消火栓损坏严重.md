Severe Damage to Fire Hydrants in Wuhan

Our city currently has 3,216 fire hydrants, of which 2,475 were damaged last year. In the Wuchang district, more than 80% of the fire hydrants are either missing "arms" or "legs," and the situation has reached a point where it seriously threatens firefighting efforts. On December 4 last year, a fire broke out in a residential unit on Hanyang Road in Hankou. The fire brigade immediately rushed to the scene, but since the three nearby fire hydrants were all damaged and unusable, they had to travel far to get water, prolonging the rescue time. As a result, 23 neighboring households were affected, with direct economic losses amounting to over 99,000 yuan.

The main manifestations of damaged fire hydrants are as follows: First, farmers from the suburbs and some idle individuals in the urban areas steal the protective covers of fire hydrants, smash them with hammers, and sell them as scrap. Last year, 470 instances of fire hydrant parts being stolen were reported in our city. For example, a fire hydrant on Qingnian Road in Hankou had its cover stolen 21 times in just one month. In January of this year, five newly installed fire hydrants on Wuluo Road in Wuchang had all their covers stolen within three days. Second, the phenomenon of fire hydrants being buried is severe. Some construction units pile materials on top of fire hydrants, preventing them from being accessible until the construction is completed. Some individual vendors also stack their goods on top of fire hydrants. In the small commodity market on Hanzheng Street in Hankou, more than 20 fire hydrants are almost completely surrounded by a variety of goods. Third, the frequency of cars colliding with and breaking fire hydrants is high. Last year, 77 fire hydrants in Wuhan were damaged by cars. Some drivers, after colliding with a fire hydrant, neither report the incident nor close the valve, allowing water to flow freely. Fourth, some residents arbitrarily open fire hydrants for domestic water use. Lacking the proper tools to open them, some use wrenches, while others simply smash them with bricks, causing good fire hydrants to be severely damaged. Last year, 73 fire hydrants were damaged due to residents arbitrarily opening them.

Due to financial constraints, the number of fire hydrants in Wuhan is still far from sufficient. If these limited fire hydrants are not properly managed and protected, they will seriously threaten the safety of the people's lives and property in Wuhan.

### 武汉市消火栓损坏严重

    武汉市消火栓损坏严重
    我市现有消火栓3216个，去年遭到损坏的就达2475个（次）。武昌地区80％以上的消火栓不是缺“胳膊”就是少“腿”，目前已到了严重威胁灭火工作的地步。去年12月4日，汉口沈阳路一户居民家失火，消防队立即赶到现场，但由于附近的3个消火栓均被损坏不能使用，最后只好舍近求远取水灭火，延长了扑救时间，使邻近23户受灾，直接经济损失达9.9万多元。
    损坏消火栓的主要表现：一是近郊农民和城区部分闲散人员将消火栓护盖盗走，用铁锤砸碎后当废品出卖。去年，我市消火栓配件被盗达470多次。如汉口青年路有个消火栓的护盖在一个月内连续被盗21次。今年1月，武昌武珞路新装5个消火栓，不到3天，护盖全部被盗走。二是消火栓被堆压的现象严重。一些建筑单位的材料堆压在消火栓上，不到施工结束消火栓不能“露面”。一些个体摊贩也将货物堆在消火栓上。汉口汉正街小商品市场，20多个消火栓几乎全被琳琅满目的商品“包围”。三是汽车撞断消火栓的现象频繁。去年，武汉市被汽车撞断的消火栓77个。少数司机撞断消火栓后，既不报告，也不关闸门，任水横流。四是部分居民擅自打开消火栓供生活用水。由于没有专用的开启工具，有的用板手拧，有的干脆用砖头砸，使好好的消火栓惨遭损坏。去年，由于居民擅自启动，而损坏了73个消火栓。
    由于资金紧缺，武汉市消火栓的数量还远远不够。如果这为数不多的消火栓再不加强管理、爱护，将严重威胁武汉市人民生命财产的安全。
