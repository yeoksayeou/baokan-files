The first continuous casting machine in the slab casting workshop of the Shanghai Baoshan Iron and Steel Complex was recently completed and successfully poured its first batch of steel this afternoon.

The two large-scale vertical-bending slab continuous casting machines, built by the 13th Metallurgical Construction Company of the Ministry of Metallurgy for Baosteel, each have an annual production capacity of 2 million tons. They can handle 300 tons of molten steel at a time. Compared to the traditional process of casting, stripping, and initial rolling, these machines increase the metal yield to 96% and can optimize the quality of 62 types of steel.

    宝钢连铸机建成使用
    本报上海7月3日电　记者萧关根报道：上海宝山钢铁总厂钢坯铸造车间第一台连铸机近日建成，今天下午第一炉钢试浇成功。
    由冶金部第13冶金建设公司为宝钢承建的这两台大型立弯式板坯连铸机，年生产能力均为200万吨，一次可承接300吨钢水，与传统的铸造、脱锭、初轧开坯的工艺相比，使金属收得率提高到96％，并可优化62种钢水的质量。
