Today, the Beijing Gymnasium was filled with a joyful atmosphere as more than 1,000 young violinists from the capital city joined martial law troops in celebrating the "August 1" Army Day.

Kang Keqing, Liu Lan Tao, and other leaders, along with the commanders of the capital's martial law troops, attended the celebration.

As the celebration began, more than 10 innocent and lively children ran onto the stage to present "Ugly Duckling" commemorative badges, specially made for this event, to the leaders and the commanders of the martial law troops.

The martial law troops, to express their gratitude to the capital's preschool educators and the children for their warm visit, presented a banner to the organizing unit.

The performance started with more than 1,000 children from 204 preschools across the city playing the violin together, performing five pieces in a continuous sequence. The children also performed a variety of colorful short programs, which were warmly received by the martial law soldiers. The youngest violinist was only 3 years old, while the oldest was 5 years and 10 months.
