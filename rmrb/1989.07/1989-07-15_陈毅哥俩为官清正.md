Chen Yi's elder brother, Chen Mengxi, once served as a Nationalist Party major general and magistrate. Although the two brothers chose different paths, they both served with integrity and honesty.

As early as 1927, Chen Yi was the Communist Party secretary at the Central Military Academy in Wuhan. Chen Mengxi participated in the Northern Expedition and arrived in Wuhan. Before Chen Yi left for the Nanchang Uprising, he bid farewell to his brother. Chen Mengxi said, "I have joined the revolution and participated in the Northern Expedition. I do not seek official positions or wealth. I only want to overthrow the warlords, expel the imperialists, and prosper our China, even if it means dying without regret." Chen Yi replied, "One can serve in office, but one must be an honest official. As a citizen, one must be a good citizen. Our beliefs may differ, but the principles of 'honesty' and 'goodness' must never be abandoned."

In 1938, Chen Mengxi served as the opium suppression commissioner in Xichang. At that time, many opium suppressors amassed great wealth. However, Chen Mengxi did not engage in corruption or accept bribes. Once, he uncovered a major case where soldiers and bandits conspired to smuggle 3,000 pounds of opium. The other side attempted to intervene and even sent a regiment to seize the opium by force. Chen Mengxi stood his ground, but received no support. In frustration, he resigned, borrowed 3,000 yuan, and left Xichang with his entourage. Since his term was only eight months and he was a devout Buddhist, he wrote a couplet on the door frame upon leaving: "Eight months as commissioner, 3,000 yuan in debt, two sleeves of clean wind, one bodhi." The horizontal scroll read: "Joy in suffering." Later, Chen Yi learned of the incident and highly praised his brother's conduct. He wrote in a letter to his brother: "The Buddha does not collect debts from ghosts, the people should respect the honest and virtuous," with the horizontal scroll reading: "Joy in one's place."

    陈毅哥俩为官清正
    陈毅的胞兄陈孟熙，曾任国民党少将、专员等。兄弟俩所走的道路不同，但为官均清正廉洁。
    早在1927年，陈毅在武汉中央军校任共产党的党委书记，陈孟熙参加北伐到武汉。陈毅赴南昌起义前，同哥哥话别。陈孟熙说：“我投身革命，参加北伐，一不要当官，二不要发财，只要能打倒军伐，驱逐列强，繁荣我中华就死而不悔”。陈毅说：“官可以当，但要当清官，作民则要作良民。我们信仰可以不同，但‘清’、‘良’二字万万不可丢。”
    1938年，陈孟熙任西昌行署禁烟专员。当时禁烟者多发了大财。陈孟熙却不贪污受贿。一次，他查获了兵匪合谋贩运3000斤鸦片的大案。对方一面说情通融，一面派出一团兵力拟强行夺回。陈孟熙据理力争，但未得支持，一气之下，他卸了乌纱帽，借了3000元钱，带随从离开了西昌。由于他任期仅八月，平素又信佛，离职时，便题了一副对联于门楣：“八月专员三千债，两袖清风一菩提”。横批：“乐在苦中”。后来，陈毅知其事，十分赞赏哥哥的为人，特在一封家书中赠其兄一联曰：“佛不收债鬼，民当敬清贤”，横批：“乐得其所”。
