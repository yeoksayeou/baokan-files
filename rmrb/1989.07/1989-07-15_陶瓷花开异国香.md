On the evening of May 24, the setting sun bathed the banks of the Barada River. The one-week-long Chinese Ceramic Art Exhibition opened in Damascus.

In the exhibition hall of the Syrian National Museum, the flags of China and Syria were hung on the front wall, with flower baskets presented by Syrian friends placed on either side. The display cases on both sides of the hall showcased various exquisite ceramic pieces, dazzling the eyes and leaving viewers breathless.

Nearly 300 ceramic artworks were on display, including fine porcelain, colored pottery, Jun porcelain, purple clay pottery, celadon, and some feather paintings and bark paintings. The exhibits were suitable for both refined and popular tastes. These meticulously crafted and uniquely designed artworks fully reflected the diligence and wisdom of the Chinese people, as well as the flourishing state of China's ceramic art, earning widespread praise from various circles in Syria.

"The Eighteen Arhats Crackle Vase" was one of the most precious exhibits. Due to its large size, it was difficult to place it inside the display case, and placing it outside would risk breaking it. Finally, Mr. Khalil, the Director of the Exhibition Department of the Fine Arts Bureau of the Syrian Ministry of Culture, placed it in a safe and prominent position before feeling at ease. Facing these exquisite artworks, Mr. Khalil said, "This is the largest art exhibition I have assisted the diplomatic mission in organizing in Syria."

To allow more viewers to appreciate Chinese ceramic art, Syrian Television broadcasted the news at 6 PM prime time, spreading the splendor of the Chinese Ceramic Art Exhibition to every household. Before and after the opening of the exhibition, the Syrian newspapers "Revolution," "Resurrection," and "October Daily" successively published news and articles, introducing Chinese ceramic art. They praised China's ceramic art for its long history, exquisite craftsmanship, and worldwide fame, and said that these exhibits fully demonstrated the extraordinary creativity and talent of the Chinese people and artists.

An elderly Syrian woman traveled from dozens of kilometers away to Damascus to visit the exhibition. She said, "In Syria, it is a tradition for ordinary people to collect ancient Chinese porcelain, especially when a daughter gets married, her parents always spend tens of thousands of Syrian pounds to buy one or two pieces of ancient Chinese porcelain as part of her dowry." She came specifically to select wedding gifts for her daughter who was about to get married. When she learned that this exhibition, as a cultural exchange activity, was only for display and not for sale, the elderly woman regretfully gazed at the celadon crackle vase she liked, unwilling to leave for a long time. Finally, the organizing unit gave the elderly woman a booklet of Jiangsu Yixing ceramic paintings, and she expressed her deep affection, "I will give it to my daughter to express my love for her."

In the spacious and bright 500-square-meter exhibition hall, one could often hear the audience's sighs of admiration. Mustafa, a teacher from the Damascus Institute of Applied Arts, led his students to view the exhibition twice and conducted on-site teaching. He enthusiastically praised the exquisite technology of Chinese craftsmanship and its strong national characteristics, saying it was very worth learning from. Many students expressed their desire to study in China one day. The Damascus Handicraft School also organized students to sketch on-site at the exhibition. A teacher from the school enthusiastically said, "The Chinese Ceramic Art Exhibition is not only an important cultural exchange activity but also a great art classroom, providing us with an excellent opportunity to learn and draw from Chinese culture and art. I hope that more Chinese art exhibitions will be held in Syria in the future."

    陶瓷花开异国香
    孙学斌
    5月24日傍晚，夕阳照耀在巴拉达河两岸。为期一周的中国陶瓷工艺展在大马士革开幕了。
    在叙利亚国家博物馆的展览大厅正面墙上，悬挂着中叙两国国旗，两旁摆放着叙利亚友人赠送的花篮。大厅两侧的橱窗内陈列着各种精美的陶瓷器，琳琅满目，令人目不暇接。
    这次展出的陶瓷工艺品近300件，包括美陶、彩陶、钧陶、紫砂陶、青瓷，还有部分羽毛画、树皮画，展品有雅俗共赏的特点。这些制作精良、独具匠心的工艺品充分反映了我国人民的勤劳智慧以及我国陶瓷工艺园地百花盛开的繁荣景象，赢得了叙利亚各界人士的普遍赞赏。
    “十八罗汉开片瓶”是这次展览中最珍贵的展品之一。由于体积大，放在橱窗内有困难，放在橱窗外又极易打碎，最后叙利亚文化部美术司展览处处长哈利勒先生将它放在既安全又显著的位置才放心。面对这些精致的艺术佳品，哈利勒先生说：“这是我协助外交使团在叙利亚举办的最大的一次工艺品展览。”
    为让更多的观众有机会欣赏中国陶瓷工艺品，叙利亚电视台在下午6时黄金时间播出消息，把中国陶瓷工艺展的盛况传遍千家万户。展览开幕前后，叙利亚《革命报》、《复兴报》、《十月日报》相继发表消息和文章，介绍中国陶瓷工艺，赞扬中国的陶瓷工艺具有悠久的历史，精湛的技艺，早已举世闻名，还说这些展品充分显示了中国人民和艺术家非凡的创造力和才华。
    一位叙利亚老太太专程从几十公里以外赶到大马士革来参观。她说：“在叙利亚，老百姓有收藏中国古瓷的传统，特别在女儿出嫁时父母总要花几万叙镑购置一、两件中国古瓷作为女儿的陪嫁品。”她就是特地来为即将出嫁的女儿选购嫁妆的。当她得知此次展览作为文化交流活动只展不售时，老太太深表遗憾地凝望着那中意的青瓷开片瓶，久久不愿离去。最后主办单位送给老人一本江苏宜兴陶瓷画册，她才深情地表示：“我将把它送给女儿，以表达我对女儿的一片心意。”
    在500平方米宽敞明亮的展览大厅内，不时听到观众的赞叹声。大马士革实用美术学院教师穆斯塔法两次带领学生观看展览并进行现场教学。他热情地赞扬中国工艺品技术精湛，并具有浓郁的民族特色，很值得借鉴。许多同学非常向往有一天能到中国学习深造。大马士革手工艺学校也专门组织学生到展览会进行现场临摹。该校一位教师热情赞扬说：“中国陶瓷工艺展不仅是一次重要的文化交流活动，也是一个艺术的大课堂，为我们学习、借鉴中国文化艺术提供了极好的机会，希望今后有更多的中国艺术展在叙利亚展出。”
