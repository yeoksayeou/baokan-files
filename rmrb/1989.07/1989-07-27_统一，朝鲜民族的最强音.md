	Unity, the Strongest Voice of the Korean Nation
	Zhou Bixiong

	"We have only one homeland, and we must unite, and we can achieve unity in our generation!" This was the impassioned statement made by Lin Xiuqing, a representative of the South Korean University Student Council (abbreviated as "Quanda Xie"), who, despite obstacles from the South Korean authorities, traveled thousands of miles to Pyongyang to participate in the World Youth Festival. Her words resonated deeply with the hearts of millions of Koreans who have been tormented by the separation of their homeland.

	Indeed, on the Korean Peninsula, regardless of whether one is in the north or south, young or old, millions of hearts yearn for unity, much like the desperate hope for rain in a drought. The call for unity echoes through every corner of the peninsula, becoming the strongest voice in the hearts of the Korean people. Lin Xiuqing's journey to Pyongyang is just another example of this sentiment.

	The "Quanda Xie" is composed of student council presidents from 152 universities in South Korea, representing 1 million South Korean students. To participate in the 13th World Youth Festival held in Pyongyang, the "Quanda Xie" established a preparatory committee to undertake various preparations. Due to the South Korean authorities' refusal to allow representatives from the "Quanda Xie" to participate, the committee was forced to secretly send representatives to Pyongyang. Lin Xiuqing is a fourth-year student in the French Department at Seoul Foreign Language University. Due to her excellent academic performance in her first two years, she was elected as the deputy director of the student council's administrative department in her third year, becoming more actively involved in student movements. The committee, recognizing her strong will and possession of a passport, selected her as the representative. On June 21, Lin Xiuqing flew to Tokyo, originally planning to travel to Pyongyang via Beijing. However, due to the exposure of the news by Agence France-Presse, she had to change her itinerary, first flying to West Germany, then to Berlin, from there to Moscow, and finally directly to Pyongyang from Moscow. What should have been a 4-hour journey from Seoul to Pyongyang took her 10 days. She emotionally stated, "As members of the same nation, I came here and was warmly welcomed by my fellow countrymen in the north, feeling both proud and saddened by the reality of having to travel around the world to get here!"

	As Lin Xiuqing stated at the press conference in Pyongyang, the reason she braved the difficulties and dangers to go to Pyongyang was to realize the "wish of 70 million compatriots to unite the motherland." Indeed, before leaving Seoul, she wrote in a letter to her parents, "I love the southern half of our divided homeland, and I also love the northern half, because it is also part of our homeland that we must make whole"; "Now, I am not just the daughter of my parents, I am determined to be a proud daughter of the homeland." The enthusiastic welcome she received upon arriving in Pyongyang exceeded her expectations, making her deeply feel the "high enthusiasm of compatriots for the unification of the motherland."

	During the festival, she actively participated in various activities. On July 7, she co-signed a joint declaration with Kim Chang-rong, chairman of the North Korean Student Committee, expressing their determination to "strive together for the unification of the homeland by at least 1995." After the festival, she visited various places. When writing the date for her autograph, she did not use the Gregorian calendar or the Dangun calendar (South Korean calendar), but intentionally wrote "Year 45 of the Unification Wish." Indeed, the Korean people have been yearning for the unification of their homeland for 45 years! On July 20, she participated in the "International Peace March" composed of more than 400 people from over 30 countries and regions, aiming for peace and unification on the Korean Peninsula, and decided to march through Panmunjom on July 27 to return directly to Seoul.

	In South Korea, Lin Xiuqing's actions sparked two diametrically opposed reactions: young students saw her as a fearless hero, and the "Quanda Xie" planned to hold a grand welcome ceremony for her. However, the authorities accused her of violating the "National Security Law" and decided to detain and investigate her upon her return to South Korea. Even Lin Xiuqing's father was forced to resign from his job. The news reached Pyongyang, and foreign legal professionals participating in the festival immediately formed an "International Defense Team" to actively work for Lin Xiuqing's safety.

	On July 20, the Korean Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland sent a letter to Lee Hong-gu, the head of the South Korean Ministry of Unification, stating, "If Lin Xiuqing is arrested and persecuted, North-South relations will deteriorate further, and it will be a serious obstacle to the process of peaceful reunification." Lin Xiuqing herself has mentally prepared for this. To demonstrate her commitment to the unification of the homeland, she repeatedly said, "I must go back through Panmunjom, and if they do not open the gate, I will fight to the death!"

	Panmunjom should be open and unobstructed, and the artificially divided North and South of Korea should be united! Separated family members should be reunited! This is the common wish of all Korean people. Lin Xiuqing's actions perfectly reflect the strongest voice in the hearts of the people. Unity is the will of the people, and it is an irresistible force that no power can stop.

	Lin Xiuqing, who participated in the International Peace March (third from the right in the front row), personally wrote on the banner, "Our homeland is one, and our wish is unity," and called on representatives from various countries to sign it before setting off with the representatives.

### 统一，朝鲜民族的最强音

    统一，朝鲜民族的最强音
    周必忠
   “我们的祖国是一个，我们必须统一，而且能够在我们这一代就实现统一！”这是冲破南朝鲜当局的阻挠、在地球上辗转万里到达平壤参加世界青年联欢节的南朝鲜大学生协议会（简称“全大协”）代表林秀卿（前译林秀京），在平壤举行记者招待会时慷慨激昂的陈词。
    的确，在朝鲜半岛，地无分南北，人无分老幼，几千万颗因骨肉分离而被极度痛苦折磨的心，随着时间的推移，越来越像大旱望云霓般渴望统一。呼唤统一之声，响彻半岛的各个角落，已经成为朝鲜民族心底的最强音。南朝鲜大学生林秀卿的平壤之行，为人们提供了又一个新的例证。
    由南朝鲜152所大学的学生会会长组成的“全大协”，是100万南朝鲜大学生的代表。为了参加在平壤举行的第13届世界青年联欢节，“全大协”专门成立了筹委会，进行多方面的准备工作。由于南朝鲜当局不准“全大协”派代表参加，筹委会被迫决定秘密派代表前往平壤。林秀卿是汉城外语大学法语系4年级学生。她因入学后头两年学习成绩优秀，3年级时被选为该校学生会总务部副部长，从而更积极地参加学生运动。筹委会认为她斗志坚强，又持有护照，便推选她为代表。6月21日，林秀卿飞抵东京，原打算经北京去平壤。由于法新社记者披露了消息，招来麻烦，她不得不改变行程，先乘飞机到联邦德国，再到柏林，从那里飞往莫斯科，最后由莫斯科直飞平壤。从汉城到平壤原不过4小时路程，而她竟花费掉10天时间。对此，她激动地说：“作为同一民族，我来到这里，受到北方同胞的热情欢迎，感到自豪，同时又因不得不在地球上绕一大圈这个现实而感到悲哀！”
    正如林秀卿在平壤顺安机场发表声明时所说，促使她不顾艰难险阻毅然前往平壤的原因，是为了实现“7000万同胞统一祖国的愿望”。确实如此，离开汉城前，她在留给双亲的信中写道：“我热爱被分裂的祖国南半部土地，同时也热爱北半部土地，因为它同样是我们必须成为整体的祖国”；“如今我不仅是爸爸妈妈的女儿，我决心成为祖国的一个骄傲的女儿。”抵达平壤时所受到的热烈欢迎，超出意料，使她深感
  “同胞们渴望统一祖国的热情之高”。
    联欢节期间，她积极参加各项活动。7月7日，她同朝鲜学生委员会委员长金昌龙共同签署北南青年学生关于自主和平统一祖国的联合宣言，表示要“为至少在1995年实现祖国统一而共同奋斗”。联欢节闭幕后，她到各地参观访问。在写留言落款日期时，她既不按公元，也不按檀纪（南朝鲜纪年法），而是特意写上“统一愿望45年”。是呀，朝鲜人民渴望祖国统一已经45年了！7月20日，她参加由30多个国家和地区400多人组成的为了朝鲜半岛的和平和统一“国际和平大行军”，决心在27日步行穿过板门店，径直返回汉城。
    在南朝鲜，林秀卿的行动激起两种截然相反的反应：青年学生们把她看作无畏的勇士，“全大协”准备为她举行盛大欢迎会。而当局却诬陷她违犯“国家保安法”，决定在她一回到南朝鲜立即对她进行拘留调查。甚至林秀卿父亲也被所在单位逼迫辞职。消息传到平壤，参加联欢节的外国法律界人士立即组成“国际辩护人团”，准备为林秀卿的安全积极活动。
    7月20日，朝鲜祖国和平统一委员会转交给南朝鲜国土统一院长官李洪九的一封信指出，“如果逮捕和迫害林秀卿，北南关系势将更加恶化，并且是对和平统一进程设下严重的障碍。”林秀卿自己呢，她思想上对此作了充分准备。为了表明自己致力统一祖国的决心，她不止一次地说：“一定要通过板门店回去，如果他们不把门打开，即使豁出生命也要同他们斗争！”
    板门店应该畅通无阻，人为分裂的朝鲜北南两个部分应该统一！离散骨肉应该团圆！这是全体朝鲜人民的共同愿望。林秀卿的言行，正好反映了人民心底的最强音。统一，是人心所向，是任何力量也阻挡不了的。（附图片）
