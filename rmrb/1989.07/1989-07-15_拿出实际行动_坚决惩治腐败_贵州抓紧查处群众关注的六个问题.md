Today, Liu Zhengwei, Secretary of the Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, announced at the second plenary session of the sixth provincial committee that the Party will resolutely punish corruption and handle six key issues of public concern in the near future.

The six key issues that the Guizhou Provincial Committee will address are as follows: First, thoroughly clean up and rectify companies. The province will expedite the investigation and handling of the more than ten cases of speculation, illegal operations, and illegal profiteering that have already been identified. Second, seriously investigate and handle cases of abuse of power, extortion, bribery, favoritism, and malpractice among leaders at all levels. Third, firmly curb the trend of illegal land occupation for private housing. All local governments and departments must conduct a comprehensive investigation within three months on the issue of officials building private houses since 1987. Fourth, strictly control the purchase of small cars. Henceforth, all party and government agencies are prohibited from purchasing imported luxury cars and cars not included in the plan. Fifth, resolutely correct the bad practices of wasting public funds, extravagant banquets, and violating regulations to entertain and give gifts. All party and government agencies and their staff are strictly prohibited from accepting gifts from subordinates, and even more so from using their positions to extort and demand. The bad practice of using weddings, funerals, and other occasions to hold extravagant banquets must be curbed. Those who violate these regulations will be severely criticized and educated, and may face disciplinary actions. Sixth, the province will thoroughly investigate and handle issues related to party members and cadres, especially party leaders, engaging in business and entrepreneurship, violating labor and personnel systems to promote relatives and children, and using their positions to benefit from the allocation of scarce commodities, important materials, and housing.

Liu Zhengwei emphasized that the province must start from the provincial party and government leadership, from the top down, and implement a system of accountability for clean governance. Each level of the party committee and government must take the lead, with the main leaders personally overseeing the implementation, to ensure that results are achieved and public trust is earned. Special attention must be paid to cases involving leaders, their children, and other high-profile individuals. The facts must be thoroughly investigated and handled seriously. No one will be allowed to tolerate, protect, or cover up any wrongdoing.

    拿出实际行动  坚决惩治腐败
    贵州抓紧查处群众关注的六个问题
    本报贵阳7月15日电  记者潘帝都报道：今天，中共贵州省委书记刘正威在省委六届二次全会上代表省委宣布，坚决惩治腐败，在近期内要办六件振奋党心民心的事情。
    贵州省委要办的这六件事，一是彻底清理整顿公司。对前一段已经清理出来的十几起投机倒把、违法经营、非法牟取暴利的案件，要抓紧时间查实处理。二是严肃查处各级领导干部中弄权勒索、贪污受贿、徇私枉法、营私舞弊的案件。三是坚决刹住违法违章占地建私房的歪风。各地各部门要立即用三个月的时间，对1987年以来干部建私房的问题，进行全面清查。四是严格控制购买小汽车。今后所有党政机关一律不准购买进口豪华型小汽车和计划外小汽车。五是坚决纠正公款挥霍浪费、大吃大喝、违反规定请客送礼等不良行为。各级党政机关及其工作人员，一律不准接受下级赠送的礼品，更不准利用职权之便索拿卡要，杜绝不请客送礼办不成事的恶劣作风，坚决刹住借婚丧嫁娶大操大办的不良风气。凡违反的，要严肃批评教育，直至给予党纪、政纪处分。六是对党员干部特别是党员领导干部经商办企业的问题，违反劳动人事制度安插提拔亲友子女的问题，利用职权在分配紧俏商品、重要物资、分配住房等方面以权谋私的问题，都要认真清理，严肃查处。
    刘正威强调指出，严厉惩治腐败，全省要从省级党政领导机关做起，从省级领导干部做起，自上而下，层层落实。各级党委、政府都要由主要领导亲自动手，实行廉政责任制，一抓到底，抓出成效，取信于民。特别要把涉及到领导干部、领导干部子女以及其它影响大的案件作为重点，查清事实，严肃处理。决不允许任何人纵容、袒护和包庇。
