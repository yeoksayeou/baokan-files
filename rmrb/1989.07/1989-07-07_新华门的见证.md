On May 17, 1989, the student hunger strike in Tiananmen Square entered its fifth day.

At 2 PM, eight male and female students from the China University of Political Science and Law, carrying a banner reading "China University of Political Science and Law Student Hunger Strike Group," arrived at the Zhongnanhai New China Gate and announced that they would begin a hunger strike there. At 9 PM, another group of people arrived with a banner reading "China University of Political Science and Law Faculty Hunger Strike Group" and joined the hunger strike at the New China Gate.

By this point, following several attempts to storm the New China Gate starting on April 18, and the sit-in by over 100 university students here on May 13, the New China Gate had become a place where a small group of people trampled on the law, spread rumors, and viciously attacked the Communist Party of China, socialism, and the party and state leaders. The author witnessed these scenes from April 19 to June 3.

The Gate of the Nation Trampled

Every day from morning to late at night, thousands of people gathered in front of the New China Gate. A small group of people with ulterior motives spread rumors, shouted reactionary slogans, made reactionary speeches, and viciously attacked the party and state leaders. On April 18, they shouted the first reactionary slogans here: "Overthrow the Communist Party" and "Abolish the Four Cardinal Principles." From then on, the reactionary clamor at the New China Gate grew louder and louder. During those chaotic days and nights, reactionary speeches attacking the party and government were made every few minutes. Some people used their own rhymes to ridicule and curse the party and state leaders, or spread so-called "latest news," openly spreading rumors such as "70,000 workers at Capital Steel have gone on strike," "Xusheng and Nie Rongzhen oppose martial law," and so on. They also spread slander from "Voice of America" and Hong Kong and Taiwan media. They pasted reactionary leaflets and big-character posters on the gateposts, windowsills, and walls on both sides of the New China Gate, even on the flagpole and stone lions in front of the New China Gate.

Every evening, when the guards came to lower the flag, some people would shout and throw stones and spit at the national flag and the guards. They even invited someone like Yang Lianzhi to sing reactionary songs here. They even brought mentally ill people to perform. It was Yang Lianzhi who set up loudspeakers on the flagpole and trees in front of the New China Gate, endlessly attacking the party's leadership, the socialist system, and the people's government, openly inciting students to take up arms and overthrow the government, and shouting, "Let's fully carry out the 'Four Greats' and launch another 'Cultural Revolution'."

In the "University Faculty Hunger Strike Group" in front of the New China Gate, many people were not actually teachers. Li Zixi from the China University of Political Science and Law Press, who was originally a worker at the press, had committed serious errors by taking advantage of his job to make a large amount of kickbacks and was about to be expelled by the school. It was this person who became an organizer, running around and threatening that if their demands were not met, they would self-immolate in front of the New China Gate. He also arrogantly grabbed the arm of the guard who raises and lowers the national flag and shouted, "You should rebel! Turn your guns around and aim them at the government! Otherwise, we will settle accounts with you one day."

Strange Incidents During the Hunger Strike

Hunger strikes and sit-ins are supposed to be very painful. However, the hunger strikers in front of the New China Gate came and went in small groups. The author noticed that these hunger strikers were secretly eating chocolates, bread, and condensed milk in the corners. When the crowd brought them water to drink, they put the water aside without a second thought and eagerly drank Beijing royal jelly. They said, "We only announced that we would stop eating and drinking water, not that we would stop drinking beverages." Some kind-hearted people were puzzled and said, "They have been fasting for so many days, but their spirits are still high, which is really strange." Others pointed out bluntly, "These people's hunger strike is completely a trick to deceive people and a political ploy to pressure the government!"

Every night, people could see that those sitting in front of the gate were either hugging each other or laughing and joking. Many people in the scene could not bear to watch and left with looks of disgust.

The Military is Humiliated

To protect the dignity of the country and prevent a small group of criminals from rushing into Zhongnanhai, the guards followed the upper-level instructions of "not striking back when hit, not retaliating when insulted," sitting in neat rows to form a human wall to protect Zhongnanhai with their flesh and blood.

However, these young soldiers were repeatedly subjected to various vicious insults and attacks. Some people threw sugar in the soldiers' faces, and someone nearby shouted, "That's right! Feed the dogs!" A few people cursed the soldiers as "running dogs," "idiots," "bastards," "servants," "Fascists," and "slaves." Some people forced reactionary leaflets into the soldiers' arms and shouted into the soldiers' ears with loudspeakers. Some people twisted the soldiers' ears and said maliciously, "Do you listen?" Some people threw stones, bricks, glass shards, and soda bottles at the soldiers' heads, injuring dozens of soldiers. Some indecent women also performed obscene acts in front of the soldiers. On the evening of June 3, a small group of rioters twice stormed the New China Gate, using sticks, bricks, and steel bars to beat these unarmed soldiers who were implementing the "two no's" policy to death. An old woman could not bear to watch and said angrily, "These soldiers are just seventeen or eighteen years old, you can't treat them like this." As soon as she finished speaking, she was attacked by a group of people.

To avoid injuring the crowd, the guards endured humiliation with great tolerance and restraint and did not retaliate.

The Last Struggle in Despair

At 3 AM on May 31, leaders and teachers from the State Council Office, the Ministry of Aerospace Industry, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Ministry of Justice, and Beijing University of Science and Technology, Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and China University of Political Science and Law came to the New China Gate, persuading the students to consider the bigger picture and leave the New China Gate. Before 4 AM, the students from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics left with their school leaders, and some students from other schools also accepted the suggestion to leave, with some loading their belongings onto trucks. At this time, a bespectacled, long-haired leader from China University of Political Science and Law suddenly stood up and shouted in a threatening tone, "Classmates! Are you just going to leave like this? If you think you did something wrong, you leave, if you think you did something right, you sit down!" A young man who had just run from Tiananmen Square to a group of students who were about to leave said, "The Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students knows you are leaving and orders you to continue to persist." Someone took the opportunity to shout, "Persist to the end is victory!" "Whoever leaves will be killed!" A large group of people who had come from Tiananmen Square stood on the trucks, frantically banging and shouting wildly, surrounding and insulting the department and school leaders who were doing persuasion work. The group of students who were about to leave were forced to stay in front of the New China Gate.

However, history is ruthless. Three days later, a counter-revolutionary riot was crushed. The five-star red flag in front of the New China Gate still fluttered in the wind, looking even more vibrant.

    新华门的见证
    郑岩
    1989年5月17日，天安门广场学生静坐绝食进入第5天。
    下午两点，8名男女学生打着“中国政法大学学生绝食团”的横幅，来到中南海新华门前，宣布在此开始静坐绝食。晚9点，又有一批人扛着“中国政法大学教师绝食团”的旗子，加入新华门前绝食行列。
    至此，继4月18日起几次冲击新华门，5月13日100多名大学生在这里静坐之后，新华门前变成了一伙人任意践踏法制、制造谣言、丧心病狂地攻击中国共产党、攻击社会主义、攻击党和国家领导人的场所。笔者自4月19日至6月3日，在新华门前目睹了这一幕幕闹剧。
    国门被蹂躏
    每天早晨至深夜，新华门前聚集着成千上万的人。一小撮别有用心的人，在这里肆无忌惮地散布谣言，呼喊反动口号，发表反动演讲，对党和国家领导人进行恶毒的人身攻击。4月18日，他们在这里喊出了第一声“打倒共产党”、“取消四项基本原则”的反动口号。从此，新华门前的反动鼓噪愈演愈烈。在那些动乱的日日夜夜里，新华门前，隔一会儿便有人发表攻击党和政府的反动演讲；或用自编的顺口溜对党和国家领导人进行丑化、谩骂，或发表所谓“最新消息”，公开造谣，说什么“首钢七万工人罢工了”，“徐帅、聂帅反对戒严”等等；或传播“美国之音”和港台舆论的诽谤之词。他们还把反动传单、大小字报贴在新华门的门柱上、窗台上以及两旁的墙壁上，连新华门前的国旗旗杆和石狮也难以幸免。
    每天傍晚，警卫战士来到旗杆下降旗，一些人便乱喊乱叫，恶狠狠地朝国旗上、警卫战士身上扔石头、吐唾沫。他们还请来什么“狂人”杨连志在这里弹唱反动歌曲，甚至把精神不正常的人拉来出丑。就是那个杨连志，在新华门前的旗杆上、树上架起电喇叭，连篇累牍地攻击党的领导、社会主义制度和人民政府，公然煽动学生拿起武器推翻政府，狂叫“放手开展‘四大’，再来一次‘文化大革命’”。
    在新华门前的“大学教师绝食团”里，许多人根本不是教师。政法大学教师绝食团的李子熙，原是政法大学出版社的工人，因利用工作之便捞取了大量回扣，犯有严重错误，校方正准备将他开除。就是这么一个人，居然成了组织者，上窜下跳，扬言如果达不到目的，就在新华门前自焚。他还狂妄地扯着升降国旗的警卫战士的胳膊叫嚷：“你们起义吧，把枪口掉过来对准政府吧，不然的话，我们总有一天要和你们算帐。”
    绝食静坐中的怪事
    静坐绝食本来是非常痛苦的。但是，新华门前的绝食者却三三两两，时而去，时而来。笔者发现，这些绝食的人在旮旯里偷吃巧克力、面包、炼乳等食品。群众送水给他们喝，他们却毫无顾忌的把水放在一边，津津有味地吸着北京蜂王浆。他们说：“我们只宣布绝食绝水，没有说绝饮料。”有些善良的群众不解地说：“他们绝了那么多天的食，精神还挺足，真是怪事。”也有的群众一针见血地指出：“这些人绝食完全是骗人的把戏，是向政府施加压力的政治伎俩！”
    每到晚上，人们可以发现，那些在门前静坐的人，有的男女勾肩搂腰，有的嬉笑戏谑。在场的许多人看不下去，带着鄙夷的目光离开了。
    解放军遭侮辱
    为了祖国的尊严，为了不让一小撮歹徒冲进中南海，警卫战士遵照上级“打不还手、骂不还口”的指示，整整齐齐坐成一排，以自己的血肉之躯筑起保卫中南海的人墙。
    然而，这些年轻士兵却不断遭到各种恶毒的侮辱和攻击。有的人把糖往战士脸上扔，旁边就有人喊：“对！喂狗！”少数人骂战士是“走狗”、“白痴”、“混蛋”、“家丁”、“法西斯”、“奴才”；有的人硬把反动传单往解放军战士怀里塞，把电喇叭对着战士的耳朵狂叫；有的人拧住战士的耳朵，恶狠狠地说：“听话吗？”；有的往官兵头上扔石头、砖块、玻璃片、汽水瓶，先后打伤几十名官兵；还有一些不三不四的女人在官兵面前做下流动作。6月3日傍晚，一小撮暴徒两次冲击新华门，用木棍、砖头、钢筋，将这些手无寸铁、实行“两不”政策的战士往死里打。一位老太太实在看不下去，气愤地说：“这些解放军都才是十七八岁的孩子，你们不能这样对待他们。”话音刚落，她就遭到了一群人的围攻。
    为了不误伤群众，警卫战士以极大的宽容和克制，忍辱负重，没有反击。
    沮丧中的最后顽抗
    5月31日凌晨3点，国务院办公厅、航空航天工业部、中国科学院、司法部及北京科技大学、北京航空航天大学、中国政法大学等单位的领导和老师来到新华门前，苦口婆心地劝学生以大局为重，撤离新华门。凌晨4时前，北航的学生随校领导全部撤离，其它学校的一些人也接受了撤离的意见，有的将物品搬到卡车上。这时，政法大学一个戴眼镜、留长发的头头突然站起来，用威胁的口气喊：“同学们！你们就这样走了吗？你们认为自己做错了就走，你们认为做对了就坐下！”旁边一个刚从天安门广场跑过来的男青年，向准备撤离的学生说：“高自联知道你们要撤，命令你们继续坚持。”有人趁机喊：“坚持到底就是胜利！”“谁走就打死谁！”一大群从天安门广场来的人，有的站在卡车上疯狂敲打，狂呼乱叫，围攻辱骂正在做疏导工作的部、校领导。准备撤离的学生队伍又被胁迫留在了新华门前。
    然而历史是无情的。时隔3天，一场反革命暴乱被一举粉碎。新华门前的五星红旗依然在迎风招展，显得更加鲜艳。
