Inflation is like a many-headed hydra that is difficult to control, wreaking havoc and disrupting the economic stability and development of countries around the world. Western countries, which have long dealt with this monster, after experiencing severe inflation in the early 1970s and 1980s, are now facing a resurgence of the threat of rising inflation.

This year, inflation in major Western industrial countries has risen significantly. According to statistics, in 1988, the U.S. inflation rate was 4.1%, and it is estimated that this year it may rise to 4.7%; Italy's inflation rate last year was 5%, but it rose to 6.4% in January this year and 9.5% in February; France's inflation rate last year was 2.7%, but it rose to between 3.7% and 4.4% in January and February this year; the UK's inflation rate in 1988 was 4.9%, but it rose to 8.6% in January this year; Canada's inflation rate in 1988 was 4%, but it rose to 7.2% in January this year and fell to 6.3% in February; West Germany, which has long been praised as the "world champion of price stability," had an inflation rate of only 1.2% last year, but this year the rate of price increases has accelerated significantly, with an estimated inflation rate of 2.5% to 3% for the year; Japan is trying to keep its recent inflation rate within 1.4%, but it has recently been stable below 1%. The OECD recently raised its forecast for the average inflation rate of the 24 member countries this year from the original 4% to 4.5%, far exceeding the 3.8% level of 1988. Experts are concerned that if this trend of rising inflation cannot be effectively curbed, it may have disastrous consequences for the economic outlook of Western countries.

The reason for the general rise in inflation rates in Western countries this year and the increased pressure is the result of the interaction and influence of various factors in the world economic system: Western countries have been able to maintain low inflation for a relatively long period in the past, and an important factor is that low oil prices have been a great help. Due to the increase in global oil demand and the relatively good implementation of OPEC's production cut agreement, oil prices have been rising rapidly since the end of last year, significantly increasing production costs. In recent years, the global trade situation has improved, consumption has continued to grow, and investment has increased significantly. In particular, the European Community countries, in order to serve their own interests, have been competing to invest in the construction of the 1992 single market, which has also driven investment in industrial countries outside the European Community. This situation inevitably leads to a surge in demand for raw materials in the international market, a shortage of goods, and rising prices. The severe drought in the U.S. Midwest and North America in 1988, as well as floods and locust plagues in many regions of Asia and Africa, have led to a significant reduction in global grain production, causing food prices to continue to rise. Taking the United States as an example, people are already feeling the pressure of inflation in their daily lives. Prices of some food items in the market are rising.

Western countries are currently facing rising inflation, which is contrary to their desire to reduce inflation this year. To prevent the return of hyperinflation, Western countries have taken some usual measures, such as raising interest rates, tightening monetary policy, and cutting fiscal budgets. However, what troubles Western economists is that this weapon of interest rates must be used with caution. If not handled properly, it will not only lead the economy into recession but also cause instability in the foreign exchange market and further worsen the debt problem. In addition, due to the significant differences in the degree of inflation in Western countries at present, the interests of each country are different, and they often start from solving their own problems, making it difficult to take unified action. This undoubtedly increases the difficulty of controlling inflation. However, the goal of Western countries is to both control the inflation they face and prevent economic recession. For these countries, this idea of having the best of both worlds is certainly good, but in reality, it is very difficult to achieve.

    西方国家面临通货膨胀威胁
    顾玉清
    通货膨胀如同一条难以制服的七头蛇，到处兴风作浪，破坏着世界各国经济的稳定与发展。长期与这个怪物打交道的西方国家，在经历了70—80年代初严重的通货膨胀之后，目前愁云再起，面临不断上升的通货膨胀的威胁。
    今年以来，西方主要工业国家通货膨胀明显上升。据统计，1988年，美国通货膨胀率为4.1％，预计今年可能升至4.7％；意大利去年的通货膨胀率为5％，今年1月份上升到6.4％，2月份升至9.5％；法国去年通货膨胀率为2.7％，今年1、2月份升至3.7％至4.4％；英国1988年通货膨胀率为4.9％，今年1月份上升到8.6％；加拿大1988年通货膨胀率为4％，今年1月份上升到7.2％，2月份降为6.3％；一向被人们誉为“物价稳定世界冠军”的西德，去年通货膨胀率仅为1.2％，而今年物价上涨速度明显加快，估计今年西德的通货膨胀率可能上升到2.5％至3％；日本正在设法使最近的通货膨胀率控制在1.4％范围内，然而，不久前还一直稳定在1％以下。经合组织前不久已把该组织24个成员国今年平均通货膨胀率的预测数字由原来的4％提高到4.5％，大大超过1988年3.8％的水平。有关专家担心，倘若这种通货膨胀增长的势头不能有效地遏止，可能会给西方经济发展前景带来灾难性的后果。
    西方国家今年通货膨胀率普遍上升，压力增加，乃是世界经济体系中多种因素相互影响、作用的结果：西方国家在过去相当长的时期内，所以能保持低通货膨胀，很重要的一点，就是低廉的油价帮了大忙。由于世界石油需求量增加以及欧佩克限产协议得以较好的执行，油价从去年底开始迅速上升，使产品生产成本大大提高。近年来，世界贸易形势好转，消费持续增长，投资大幅度增加，尤其是欧共体国家为了自身的利益，都在为建成1992年统一大市场竞相投资，亦由此带动了欧共体以外工业国的投资，这种状况难免会造成国际市场原材料需求旺盛，物资紧缺，价格上涨。1988年美国中西部和北美一些地区的特大旱灾，亚非不少地区的水灾和蝗灾，使世界粮食严重减产，导致食品价格不断升高。以美国为例，人们在日常生活中已处处感受到通货膨胀的压力。市场上一些食品的价格正在上涨。
    西方国家目前面临着不断攀升的通货膨胀，这是与它们试图在今年降低通货膨胀的愿望相左的。为了防止恶性通货膨胀卷土重来，西方国家已采取一些通常措施，如上调利率、紧缩货币和削减财政预算等。然而，令西方经济学家们感到头痛的是，利率这个武器必须小心使用，掌握不当，不仅会把经济导入衰退，而且将造成外汇市场不稳，债务问题进一步恶化。另外，由于目前西方国家通货膨胀的程度差别较大，各国的利害关系不同，且多从解决自己的问题出发，很难采取一致的行动，这无疑增加了治理通货膨胀的困难。但是，西方国家的目标则是，既要制服面临的通货膨胀，又要防止出现经济衰退。对于这些国家来说，这种两全其美的想法固然好，但在事实上却是很难办到的。（附图片）
