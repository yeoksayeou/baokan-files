Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 22nd.

The latest issue of the "Party Building" magazine (July-August combined issue) features an article by Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, titled: "Strengthening Party Building to Enhance Cohesion, Attraction, and Combat Effectiveness."

This article was written by Jiang Zemin when he was serving as the Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee in May of this year. The full text is approximately 6,000 words and is divided into four parts: First, under the conditions of reform and opening up, all levels of party committees must place party building on the important agenda; Second, effectively strengthen grassroots party building, fully leverage the role of grassroots party organizations as fortresses, guarantee supervision, and exemplify the vanguard role of Communist Party members; Third, it is necessary to focus on building a clean government system to maintain the integrity of party and government agencies; Fourth, it is necessary to pay attention to and strengthen the party's ideological and theoretical building, using the party's basic line to unify the thoughts and actions of the entire party.

Jiang Zemin pointed out in the article that at present, we are facing the arduous tasks of rectification and deepening reform. The Party Central Committee emphasizes the need to strengthen party building, leverage the political advantages of our party, and effectively enhance the leadership, core, and supervisory roles of our party. This is of great significance. Therefore, it is an arduous and important task for all levels of party organizations to strengthen party building and continuously enhance the cohesion, attraction, and combat effectiveness of the party.

The article states that strengthening party building first requires the party to manage itself. All levels of party committees must place party building on the important agenda, with secretaries taking the lead and using their main efforts to focus on party building.

The article states that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly proposed the idea of "two hands," but we have not yet fully handled this in our actual work. Currently, we are in a historical period of significant transformation through reform and opening up, and there are indeed risks of corruption, that is, there are conditions, breeding grounds, and loopholes for corruption. At present, the mainstream of the party is good, but there are indeed many negative phenomena developing and growing. If we do not truly solve the problem of "two hands," focusing on one hand while neglecting the other, or having one hand strong and the other weak, and if we cannot solve the long-standing issues and negative phenomena within the party, it will inevitably affect the party's ability to fight, and there is even a possibility of the party and the country perishing. Therefore, we must truly strengthen party building, firmly adhere to the principle of strict party governance, maintain a strong party spirit, maintain strict discipline, and maintain a firm belief in socialism. Past and present facts have shown that as long as all levels of party committees take it seriously and adhere to the principle of strict party governance, our party can withstand the test, and the vast majority of party organizations and members can also withstand the test.

The article states that whether grassroots party organizations are strong and cohesive or weak and dispersed directly affects the vitality of the party. In the new situation, whether the party membership can maintain its advanced nature and purity directly relates to the honor and decline of our party. The Tang Dynasty scholar Wei Zheng once said: "To seek the growth of a tree, one must solidify its roots. To seek the flow of a river, one must dredge its source." In this profound and extensive historical transformation period, if the party's grassroots organizations lack cohesion and combat effectiveness, and the majority of party members cannot play their due vanguard and exemplary roles, then the party's effective political leadership of the ongoing modernization construction will inevitably become an empty talk due to the lack of strong organizational guarantees.

The article points out that in recent years, there are several tasks that must be effectively carried out. First, to conduct democratic appraisals and handle unqualified party members; Second, to strengthen the construction of grassroots branches, general branches, and party committee leadership teams according to the requirements of strict party governance, and to stabilize and improve the party affairs cadre team; Third, to seriously summarize and actively explore new experiences in the new situation to play the role of grassroots party organizations in guaranteeing supervision.

The article points out that the Party Central Committee has issued a series of important instructions on clean governance construction. Reform and opening up, prosperity and economy; maintaining integrity and combating corruption, these two aspects are equally important and complementary, and cannot be neglected. If we only focus on economic prosperity and do not pay attention to clean governance construction, even if the economy prospers, politics will become corrupt, and corruption will have a counterproductive effect, making it impossible to maintain economic prosperity. Capitalism has seen many corrupt phenomena in the process of developing commodity economy. We, in developing socialist commodity economy, should not learn from their bad practices. Party and government agencies must be strictly managed. The core of corruption is the exchange of money and power. Party and government agencies are precisely in positions of power. If they all use their power to seek material interests for themselves, how can the economy prosper, and how can the people avoid being exploited in disguise? How can the country not collapse!

The article states that at present, the focus of clean governance construction is mainly on three aspects of work: First, to continue to play the exemplary role of leading organs and leading cadres; Second, to focus on the investigation and handling of major cases; Third, to expand the pilot work of clean governance system construction.

The article points out that at present, there is a situation where party ideological education does not meet the requirements of the situation, and it cannot meet the needs of the political health of party members. This is an urgent problem to be solved and a major topic that all levels of party organizations should actively explore and study. At present, party ideological education work should especially emphasize the following three points:

First, regarding the value concept of party members. In the new situation, it is necessary to emphasize the principle of serving the people, and to emphasize the full heart and soul for the people as the value concept of Communist Party members. Party members should "worry before the world worries and be happy after the world is happy." Now, in some party members, it seems that once the principle of distribution according to labor, more labor more pay, and material interest is mentioned, it cannot be talked about consciousness and dedication. They believe that "big goals are not as good as 'big unity,' talking about consciousness is not as good as talking about practical benefits. The spirit of Lei Feng is outdated, and those with abilities should go to make money." This shows that in some of our party members, the value concept and moral norms of wholeheartedly serving the people and considering the interests of the people have been shaken. Distribution according to labor, more labor more pay, is the distribution principle of socialism, which is a recognition of an individual's labor value by society. Its policy orientation is to guide everyone to work hard and get rich, not to give a certain amount of money for a certain amount of work. Communist Party members and the people, like their contributions, should be rewarded and rewarded according to the policies of the party and the state, according to their labor. However, the noble character of communists is determined by the party's principle. As a Communist Party member, one should have a higher ideological realm. When personal interests conflict with national and people's interests, one should voluntarily sacrifice one's own interests. Their starting point for work is not for money, but to serve the people. Therefore, party members should not only model the execution of the party and state's social and economic policies in the current stage to promote the development of socialist commodity economy; but also should abide by the party constitution, execute the party's political life norms, advocate selflessness, unity and friendship, and devote themselves to the people's cause until death. If they use the party's current policies and the principle of equivalent exchange in commodity economy to bargain with the party organization, or wait for a price, or engage in the exchange of money and power, treating the party's principles as commodities, that is absolutely not allowed. We must be soberly aware of the harm of the decadent ideas advocated by the exploiting class, such as "people die for money, birds die for food," "money is supreme, money is everything, and money can make ghosts push mills," and prevent the temptation of money, and become a true Communist Party member.

Second, regarding the adherence to the correct political direction. At present, we must face the challenge of social trends to the party's fundamental principles, correctly answer the questions that party members feel confused about in their daily lives, help party members distinguish right from wrong, and firmly establish the correct political direction. Now, many people's thoughts are active, and they dare to express different opinions, which is of course a good phenomenon. But we Communist Party members cannot think about any trend of thought or speech without thinking, but must keep a clear mind, ask a why, think about whether it is correct, and have a certain ability to discern. For example, some people propose to conduct three "reflections": whether the introduction of Marxism to China 70 years ago during the May Fourth Movement was correct? Whether the decision to take the socialist road after the party seized power 40 years ago was correct? Whether the decision to take the road of reform and opening up at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee 10 years ago was correct? I think the answers to these questions should be very clear, and there can be no half-heartedness. The May Fourth Movement introduced Marxism-Leninism, preparing the ideological and organizational foundation for the establishment of the Communist Party of China; after seizing power, taking the socialist road was the common choice of the people of the whole country; as for reform, one can ask the broad masses of workers and peasants, and even those who have various doubts and ideas about reform, whether they want to go back to the life before 1978. I am afraid no one wants to go back to 10 years ago. Therefore, I think these three "reflections" are non-issues that have been answered by the long-term revolutionary struggle and construction practice of our party.

Third, regarding the consideration of the overall situation. We must emphasize the overall concept, subordinate local interests to the overall interests, and strictly abide by the party's unified discipline, that is: individual obedience to the organization, minority obedience to the majority, lower levels obedience to higher levels, and the whole party obedience to the Central Committee. At present, we must emphasize the people's interests above all else in rectifying the economic environment and rectifying the economic order, and any party member must consciously ensure that local interests are subordinate to overall interests. We should advocate considering the overall situation, bearing more hardships for the country, and even sacrificing some of our own interests. For every party member and cadre, correctly handling the relationship between the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual is forever a yardstick that can measure our ideological realm and spiritual state. Any party member or cadre must never only consider personal or small group interests, do things that increase difficulties for the overall situation and create obstacles for reform, and must never allow localism, separatism, money worship, and extreme individualism to spread.

### 江泽民在《党建》杂志撰文  切实加强党的建设  增强党的凝聚力吸引力战斗力

    切实加强党的建设  增强党的凝聚力吸引力战斗力
    新华社北京7月22日电　最新一期《党建》杂志（7—8期合刊）刊登了中共中央总书记江泽民的一篇文章，题为：切实加强党的建设增强党的凝聚力吸引力战斗力。
    这篇文章是江泽民同志担任上海市委书记时于今年5月撰写的。全文约6000字，分为4个部分：一、在改革开放的条件下，各级党委必须把党的建设放到重要议程上来；二、切实加强基层党的建设，充分发挥基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用、保证监督作用和共产党员的先锋模范作用；三、必须抓好廉政制度建设，保持党政机关的廉洁；四、必须重视和加强党的思想理论建设，用党的基本路线统一全党的思想和行动。
    江泽民在文章中指出，当前，我们面临着治理整顿、深化改革的艰巨任务，党中央强调要加强党的建设，发挥我们党的政治优势，切实加强我们党的领导作用、核心作用和保证监督作用，这是具有十分重要意义的。因此，抓好党的建设，不断增强党的凝聚力、吸引力和战斗力，这是摆在我们各级党组织面前的一项艰巨而重要的任务。
    文章说，加强党的建设，首先是党要管党，各级党委都要把党的建设放到重要的工作日程上来，书记要到位，用主要的精力抓党的建设。
    文章说，小平同志曾多次提出要两手抓的思想，但是，我们在实际工作中还不能完全处理好。当前，我们正处在改革开放的历史性的大转变时期，确实存在腐败的危险，即存在腐败的土壤、温床和空隙。现在党的主流是好的，但是确实有许多消极现象在发展、滋长。如果我们不真正解决好两手抓的问题，抓了一手，放了另一手，或者一手长，一手短，对党内的消极腐败现象和存在的问题，长期不能解决，那末势必会影响到党的战斗力的发挥，甚至有可能亡党亡国。因此，我们必须切实加强党的建设，真正坚持从严治党，保持坚强的党性，保持严格的纪律，保持对社会主义的坚定信念。过去和现在的事实都表明，只要我们各级党委认真去抓了，从严治党的方针坚持了，我们的党是能够经得起考验的，绝大多数的党组织和党员也是能够经得起考验的。
    文章说，基层党组织是坚强有力还是软弱涣散，直接影响着党的生机。在新形势下，能否保持党员队伍的先进性和纯洁性，直接关系到我们党的荣辱兴衰。唐人魏征说过：“求木之长者，必固其根本。欲流之远者，必浚其泉源。”在如此深刻、广泛的历史大变革时期，如果党的基层组织缺乏凝聚力和战斗力，广大党员不能发挥应有的先锋模范作用，那么，党要对正在进行的现代化建设事业实现有效的政治领导，势必因为缺乏坚强的组织保证而成为一句空话。
    文章指出，在近几年中，有几项工作是必须切实抓紧抓好的。第一，要搞好民主评议和处置不合格党员的活动；第二，要按从严治党的要求抓好基层支部、总支、党委班子的建设，做好稳定和提高党务干部队伍的工作；第三，必须认真总结和积极探索在新形势下发挥基层党组织保证监督作用的新鲜经验。
    文章指出，党中央对廉政建设接连作出了一系列的重要指示。改革开放，繁荣经济；保持廉洁，反对腐败，这两个方面同等重要，相辅相成，不可偏废。如果我们只注意繁荣经济，不重视廉政建设，即使经济繁荣了，政治也会腐败，腐败后就要起反作用，经济的繁荣也不可能保持住。资本主义在发展商品经济的过程中出现了许多腐败现象，我们发展社会主义商品经济，不能学它们坏的东西，党政机关必须管严。腐败的核心问题是金钱和权力的交易。党政机关恰恰处在权力的位置上，如果都去用权力为自己谋物质利益，经济怎么能繁荣，老百姓岂不是变相地受剥削吗？国家不垮才怪呢！
    文章说，当前，廉政建设的重点主要是抓好三项工作：第一，继续发挥领导机关和领导干部的表率作用；第二，抓好重大案件的查处；第三，扩大廉政制度建设的试点。
    文章指出，现在党的思想教育存在着与形势要求不相适应的状况，不能满足党员队伍政治上健康成长的需要。这是一个亟待解决的问题，也是各级党组织应该积极探索研究的一个重大课题。目前，党的思想教育工作，要特别强调以下三点：
    第一，关于党员的价值观念问题。在新的形势下，必须强调为人民服务的宗旨，必须强调把全心全意为人民服务作为共产党员的价值观，共产党员要“先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐”。现在，在一部分党员中，好像一讲按劳分配，多劳多得，物质利益原则，就不能再谈什么觉悟、奉献精神了。认为“大目标不如‘大团结’，讲觉悟不如讲实惠。雷锋精神已过时，有本事的应当去赚钱”。这说明在我们的一部分党员中全心全意为人民服务，为人民的利益着想的价值观念和道德规范发生了动摇。按劳分配，多劳多得，是社会主义的分配原则，是社会对一个人劳动价值的一种承认。它的政策导向是引导大家勤劳致富，而不是给多少钱干多少活。共产党员和人民群众一样，对于他们的贡献，要按照国家的政策，按劳分配，给以应得的报酬和奖励。但是，共产党人的高尚情操，是由党的宗旨所决定的。作为一名共产党员理应有更高的思想境界，在个人利益与国家、人民利益发生矛盾时，应该自觉地牺牲自己的利益，他的工作出发点不是为了金钱，而是为人民服务。因此，党员既要模范地执行党和国家在现阶段的社会、经济政策，促进社会主义商品经济的发展；又要遵守党章，执行党内政治生活准则，提倡大公无私，团结友爱，为人民事业鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。如果利用党的现行政策和商品经济的等价交换原则，向党组织讨价还价，或待价而沽，或大搞“投之以木桃，报之以琼瑶”之类的金钱与权力的交易，把党的原则当作商品来交换，那是绝不允许的。我们要清醒地认识到剥削阶级所鼓吹的“人为财死，鸟为食亡”、“金钱至上、金钱万能、有钱能使鬼推磨”等腐朽思想的危害性，防止金钱的诱惑，做一个真正的共产党员。
    第二，关于坚持正确的政治方向问题。当前，我们必须正视社会思潮对党的根本原则的挑战，正确解答党员在日常生活中感到困惑的问题，帮助党员明辨是非，坚定正确的政治方向。现在，许多人思想活跃，敢于发表不同的意见，这当然是一种好的现象。但我们共产党员不能对于任何思潮或言论都不加思索，而必须保持清醒的头脑，问一个为什么，想一下是否正确，要有一定的识别能力。比如，有的人提出要进行三个“反思”：反思70年前五四运动把马克思主义传播到中国来对不对？反思40年前我们党夺取了政权后决定走社会主义道路对不对，反思10年前党的十一届三中全会确定的走改革开放道路对不对？我想对这些问题的回答应该是很明确的，来不得半点含含糊糊。五四运动引进了马列主义，为中国共产党的成立作了思想上和组织上的准备；夺取政权之后，走上社会主义道路是全国人民的共同选择；至于改革，那可以去问问广大的工人农民群众，甚至可以去问问那些对改革有着这样那样疑虑和想法的人们，是否愿意退回到1978年以前。恐怕没有人愿意回到10年前去过那时的生活。所以，我认为这三个“反思”，都是不成问题的问题，都已经为我们党长期革命斗争和建设实践所回答了。
    第三，关于顾全大局的问题。我们必须强调全局观念，局部服从全局，严格遵守党的统一纪律，即：个人服从组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央。在当前，我们要治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，更要突出强调人民的利益高于一切，任何党员都要自觉地做到局部利益服从全局利益。我们要提倡顾全大局，为国家多承担一些困难，甚至牺牲一些自己的利益。对于每个党员、干部来说，正确处理国家、集体、个人三者之间的利益关系永远是一把尺子，足以衡量出我们的思想境界和精神状态。任何党员、干部都绝不能只顾个人或小团体的利益，去干那种给全局增加困难，给改革制造障碍的事情，绝不能听任那种损害国家和人民利益的本位主义、分散主义、拜金主义和极端个人主义的泛滥。
