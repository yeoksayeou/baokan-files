Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, July 21st.

Two Chinese businessmen were murdered in Hamburg, West Germany, last September. One of the killers has been sentenced to eight years in prison, while the other awaits sentencing after attempting suicide.

The 18-year-old killer, who was sentenced to eight years, is an Afghan.

The other killer, aged 23, is also an Afghan. He attempted to hang himself in prison last week and was revived after being pronounced dead. His sentencing has been postponed until August 30 due to his current inability to appear in court.

On September 13 last year, the two killers brutally murdered Li Tiexiong, the deputy general manager of the Hamburg Great Wall China Company, and an employee named Zhang Yongqing. Their intention was to steal the warehouse keys for a burglary.

    两名中国商人在西德被杀害
    凶手一人被判刑一人待宣判
    新华社波恩7月21日电　去年9月在西德汉堡谋杀中国两名商务人员的凶手，一名被汉堡地方法院判处8年徒刑，另一名因自杀未遂待宣判。
    被判处8年徒刑的凶手今年18岁，是阿富汗人。
    另一名凶手今年23岁，也是阿富汗人，此人上周曾在监狱里上吊自杀，在已经断气的情况下又被救活。因其目前无法出庭，所以对他的宣判将推迟到8月30日进行。
    这两名凶手于去年9月13日用极其残忍的手段将汉堡长城中国有限公司副总经理李铁雄和工作人员张永清杀害，企图盗取仓库钥匙进行偷盗。
