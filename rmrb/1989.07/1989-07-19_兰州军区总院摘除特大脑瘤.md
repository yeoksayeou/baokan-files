    A patient from Gansu's Gu Lang County, who had a massive tumor on his forehead, recently underwent a successful removal of the tumor at the Neurosurgery Department of the General Hospital of the Lanzhou Military Region. The patient has since recovered and been discharged.

    The patient is 26 years old. In May 1984, a lump began to form on his forehead, gradually growing larger and eventually developing into a tumor weighing 865 grams. The tumor occupied brain tissue and penetrated the skull. Medical professionals at the General Hospital confirmed that this was a meningioma with sarcomatous changes, a condition not previously documented in domestic or international medical literature. On July 6th, the medical team successfully removed the tumor and performed a cranial defect repair using organic glass.

    兰州军区总院摘除特大脑瘤
    本报兰州七月十九日电  甘肃古浪县一位患者长在前额的巨大肿瘤，最近在兰州军区兰州总医院神经外科被成功摘除。患者近日痊愈出院。
    这位患者今年二十六岁。一九八四年五月，其前额突起，逐渐增大，形成一个重达八百六十五克的肿瘤，且占据脑组织并穿过颅骨。兰州总医院的军医们确认，此系间变性脑膜瘤，为国内外文献中所未见。七月六日，他们成功地摘除了这个肿瘤，并做了颅骨缺损有机玻璃修补术。（李智学）
