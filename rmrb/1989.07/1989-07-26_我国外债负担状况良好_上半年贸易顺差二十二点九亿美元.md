The General Administration of Customs recently published a figure of $58 billion in goods deficit. Does this indicate that China's foreign trade is in deficit? Today, Liu Xiangdong, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, explained this issue to domestic and foreign journalists.

He said that the customs' goods deficit or surplus does not represent trade deficit or surplus. The $58 billion figure published by the customs is the deficit in the value of imported and exported goods, and it does not indicate a deterioration in the trade balance. On the contrary, China had a trade surplus of $22.9 billion in the first half of this year, and there is no problem with external payments.

At the press conference, a foreign journalist raised doubts about China's ability to repay its debts in the future. Liu Xiangdong said that based on the current understanding, China's foreign debt situation is good. First, the debt structure is relatively reasonable, with medium- and long-term, medium- and low-interest debts accounting for 76% of the total foreign debt. Second, the use of foreign debt is relatively reasonable, mainly invested in urgently needed projects for introduction, with energy, transportation, and other infrastructure projects accounting for more than 60% of the total, followed by projects with good economic benefits and certain foreign exchange earning capabilities. Third, the repayment burden is completely within China's foreign exchange affordability. From 1979 to 1988, the average annual repayment rate was less than 10%. According to experts' predictions, even during the peak repayment period, the annual repayment rate will not exceed 15%. This is still a considerable distance from the internationally recognized danger line of 20% to 25%. China's foreign exchange reserves maintain a normal level, and there is potential in foreign trade exports and non-trade earnings. Even if some more foreign debt is borrowed in the future, the repayment ability is guaranteed.

### 我国外债负担状况良好  上半年贸易顺差二十二点九亿美元

    我国外债负担状况良好
    上半年贸易顺差二十二点九亿美元
    本报北京7月26日讯　记者刘霄报道：海关总署不久前公布的58亿美元的货物入超数字是否代表我国的外贸逆差？经贸部发言人刘向东今天就这个问题向中外记者做了解释。
    他说，海关货物的入超或出超并不是贸易的逆差或顺差。海关公布的58亿美元是进出口货物入超金额，不说明贸易平衡状况恶化。相反，今年上半年我国贸易顺差22.9亿美元，对外支付是没有问题的。
    新闻发布会上，有外国记者对中国今后偿还债务的能力提出质疑。刘向东说，根据目前了解的情况，我国的对外债务负担状况是良好的。一是债务结构比较合理，中长期、中低利债务占外债总额的76％；二是外债投向比较合理，基本用在急需的引进项目上，其中能源、交通等基础设施约占总额的60％以上，其次是投在经济效益好、有一定创汇能力的项目上；三是还本付息负担完全在我国外汇承受能力之内。1979年至1988年，年平均偿还率不到10％。据专家预测，即使到还本付息高峰期，年均偿债率也不超过15％。这与世界上公认的20％—25％的危险线还有较大距离。我国外汇储备保持正常水平，外贸出口和非贸易收汇都有潜力，今后再借一些外债，偿还能力也是有保证的。
