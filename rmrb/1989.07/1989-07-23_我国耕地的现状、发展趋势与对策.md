    "Land is the source of all production and existence" (Marx and Engels Selected Works, Volume 2, page 109). Human survival and social development cannot do without land. Arable land is the essence of land. Most of the material consumed by humans and more than 95% of the protein come from land, of which more than 80% of the calories and 75% of the protein come from arable land. Therefore, the quantity and quality of arable land per capita in a country, as well as the quantity and quality of the materials it provides, are the most basic material conditions for the survival and development of that nation.

    The Current Situation and Development Trends of China's Arable Land

    A large population, limited land, and insufficient arable land resources are fundamental national conditions in China, which are important factors constraining China's socio-economic development. According to statistics, in 1949, China's arable land area was 1.468 billion mu. In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic, China's reclaimed land area exceeded the basic construction land area, and arable land increased year by year. By 1957, the national arable land area had expanded to 1.677 billion mu, an increase of 2.09 billion mu from 1949, which was the year with the most arable land in China. Since then, it has been decreasing year by year. By 1986, the cumulative reduction in arable land nationwide was 6.11 billion mu, excluding 3.77 billion mu of reclaimed land, resulting in a net reduction of 2.34 billion mu. Over 29 years, the average annual reduction in arable land was 210.7 million mu, with a net reduction of 80.7 million mu. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, the country reduced arable land by a total of 875.2 million mu, reclaimed 506.3 million mu, resulting in a net reduction of 368.9 million mu, with an average annual reduction of 172 million mu and a net reduction of 73.7 million mu. Since 1986, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have taken a series of major measures to stop the arbitrary occupation of arable land, achieving some results, but the problem has not been fundamentally solved. The reasons for the reduction in arable land area are numerous, mainly including the following:

    (1) Uncontrolled occupation of arable land due to adjustments in agricultural internal structure. In the past few years, there has been a misjudgment of the grain production situation and the role of comparative benefits within agriculture, leading to inappropriate adjustments in the internal structure of agriculture. Large areas of arable land have been converted to fruit trees, aquaculture, or returned to forestry and grazing, which are the main factors contributing to the rapid reduction in arable land area. In 1985, the adjustment of agricultural internal structure occupied 191.15 million mu of arable land, accounting for 79.7% of the total reduction in arable land that year; in 1986, it occupied 128.35 million mu, accounting for 77.2% of the total reduction in arable land that year. The rapid reduction in arable land area has led to a significant decrease in grain production. In 1985, the national grain production was 28.2 million tons less than the previous year, of which about 3.59 million tons were due to the reduction in arable land caused by the adjustment of agricultural internal structure, accounting for 12.7% of the total reduction in grain production that year. In some places, the adjustment of agricultural internal structure has emphasized wealth creation, neglected grain production, and even led to phenomena such as "fruit in the plains, grain on the mountains" and abandoned and fallow land, which have not yet been effectively controlled in some places.

    (2) Increased occupation of arable land by non-agricultural construction. State construction occupies arable land, with an average of 12.86 million mu per year during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period, and the annual land occupation rate increased by 21%. Some construction projects have wide land use, less use but more reclamation, reclamation but not use, and arbitrary occupation and misuse, which are quite serious. According to the investigation of non-agricultural construction land use, 40% of non-agricultural construction projects nationwide have illegal land use, and some places have more than 50%. Over the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic, the land area occupied by towns and cities has increased too fast and too much, with some expanding 4 to 9 times. Currently, urban construction is mainly expanding outward, with very little old city renovation. Rural collective construction occupies arable land, with 13.9 million mu in 1985 and 8.78 million mu in 1986, accounting for 28.4% and 23.2% of the total non-agricultural construction land occupation in the same period, respectively. Some places have serious problems with destroying fields to build brick and tile kilns. Some township enterprises occupy large areas of land and have low building density, wasting a lot of land. Farmers building houses occupy arable land, with 14.6 million mu in 1985 and 12.7 million mu in 1986, accounting for 30.1% and 33.3% of the total non-agricultural construction land occupation in the same period, respectively. The "construction boom" in rural areas is almost nationwide, and most of it is occupying flat and good land and exceeding standards, with some destroying hundreds of mu of arable land to expand new towns and villages.

    (3) Serious natural destruction of arable land. For a long time, due to blind reclamation and excessive cultivation of mountains, forests, and grasslands, the ecological balance has been destroyed, leading to the destruction of a large amount of arable land. The area of soil erosion in China was 1.16 million square kilometers at the time of national liberation, expanding to 1.5 million square kilometers in the 1950s, accounting for 15.6% of the total land area of the country. Over 30 years, 460,000 square kilometers have been treated, but some areas have new developments, with increases and decreases offsetting each other. Currently, the area of soil erosion nationwide is approximately 1.3 million square kilometers, still accounting for 13.5% of the total land area of the country. Every year, approximately 20 million mu of arable land is destroyed by floods, desertification, and other disasters, with some places losing tens of millions of mu of arable land in a single major flood.

    (4) The land management system does not meet the needs of land management work. Before the promulgation of the Land Management Law, China's land management work was long divided among various departments, relying solely on administrative measures, with incomplete land management regulations and land management institutions, uncoordinated regulations, and weak management forces. Although a land management system has been established, in some local grassroots areas, the institutions are still very incomplete, and the Party's policies and the country's laws cannot be fully implemented.

    (5) Long-term free and unlimited use of land, eating the "land communal pot." This not only makes it impossible to reflect the economic value of state-owned and collective land ownership, but also loses the possibility of using economic means to regulate land use structure and effectively manage land. It has also led to the continuous occurrence of phenomena such as excessive reclamation, reclamation but not use, and waste of land.

    China is still in the primary stage of socialism, and all construction still needs a relatively large development. If we reach the level of a moderately developed country, that is, by 2050, how much arable land will be needed for various constructions? We have made a rough estimate: According to the national land survey statistics, China's arable land area in 1985 was approximately 1.9 billion mu (the national statistics are 1.45 billion mu), and about 1 billion mu needs to be gradually returned to forestry and grazing. Based on the speed of various constructions occupying arable land in recent years, that is, 30 million mu per year, from 1986 to 2050, a total of approximately 2 billion mu will be occupied. Natural disasters destroy arable land, with an average of 15 million mu per year, from 1986 to 2050, approximately 1 billion mu will be destroyed. The three items of construction occupation, natural destruction, and returning land to forestry and grazing will reduce arable land by approximately 4 billion mu from 1986 to 2050. During this period, through the reclamation of wasteland and the development of tidal flats, it is possible to increase 2 billion mu, ultimately leaving 1.7 billion mu of arable land. But by then, the population may exceed 1.5 billion, with less than 1 mu of arable land per capita. This is an important factor constraining China's economic development.

    Countermeasures to Solve China's Arable Land Problem

    People often say that China is vast and rich in resources. In terms of absolute numbers, China's land resources are rich, but in terms of per capita, land resources are quite scarce. Therefore, our study of land issues cannot be separated from population issues. China uses 6.8% of the world's arable land to feed 21.8% of the world's population. Currently, China is in the peak period of population growth. Some people advocate that China can solve the food problem through imports. This is not feasible. Here, it must be pointed out that the seriousness of the arable land problem lies not only in the sharp reduction in arable land area, the rapid increase in population, and the intensification of the land-population contradiction; it also lies in the fact that some of our leading comrades have not realized the huge inertia of the arable land crisis caused by the reverse development of arable land and population, and lack a sense of crisis and urgency.

    The potential crisis of China's arable land population carrying capacity is one of the biggest obstacles to China's modernization construction. It is necessary to rectify, reform comprehensively, start from now, plan for the long term, coordinate arrangements, and comprehensively treat the problem. It is necessary to persist in the long-term implementation of the guiding principles of "controlling population, saving resources, and moderate consumption," and to seriously implement the basic national policy of "treasuring and rationally utilizing every inch of land and effectively protecting arable land," to leave as much as possible of the precious resource—land—for future generations to survive and develop. Specifically, the following six aspects should be addressed:

    (1) Speed up legislation, strengthen management, and do everything possible to protect the existing arable land area. First, create a legal environment conducive to the protection of arable land. It is urgent to formulate an arable land protection law. Clearly stipulate the absolute protection number of arable land per capita, formulate a comprehensive land use plan, and demarcate agricultural protection areas according to the plan, which non-agricultural construction land cannot invade.

    Formulate various construction land standards and control the scale of urban construction land. China's various construction land standards have not yet been scientifically unified. In the future, China's urban construction land should formulate standards, generally control the scale of urban construction according to the number of urban population, promote urban land saving and rational use of land.

    Strictly control transportation land. China currently has more than 1 billion mu of transportation land, which will increase significantly in the future. The transportation land standards should be in line with China's national conditions. The reserved land and green land on both sides of railways and highways should be minimized to occupy arable land as much as possible, and engineering measures should be used to ensure the roadbed and traffic safety.

    China currently has 3.94 million villages, occupying nearly 2 billion mu of land, which is the main land occupier. It is suggested to re-plan the villages nationwide rationally. In the future, all villages with conditions should gradually move to barren mountains or inferior land, and change flat houses to apartments. If 10% of the villages can be moved to barren slopes, approximately 200 million mu of arable land can be freed up.

    Generally, agricultural internal structure adjustments should not occupy arable land. In recent years, due to the occupation of arable land by internal structure adjustments, it generally accounts for about 60% of the annual reduction in arable land. In the future, it must be strictly controlled, and all occupations of high-quality grain fields should be gradually returned. Land illegal cases should be investigated and handled according to law, and land use should be managed according to law.

    (2) Plan and lead the development of land, increase the area of arable land, and improve the quality of arable land. Plan the development of limited arable land reserves. According to preliminary investigations, there are approximately 5 billion mu of large wastelands nationwide, of which approximately 1.2 billion mu can be developed into arable land; there are approximately 1 billion mu of scattered wastelands, of which approximately 500 million mu can be developed into arable land. If the undeveloped wastelands are comprehensively developed, suitable for agriculture, forestry, grazing, aquaculture, or construction (construction land), and rationally utilized, the arable land occupied by construction can be compensated with the developed arable land, which is completely possible.

    Act according to ability and gradually improve the transformation of open channels and ridges. Currently, the national farmland irrigation and drainage channels occupy approximately 1 billion mu of arable land, and ridges and earth banks occupy tens of millions of mu of arable land. If some open channels are transformed into underground channels, and steep ridges are transformed into concrete vertical ridges, it is estimated that several tens of millions of mu of arable land can be increased.

    Strive to improve the reclamation rate of abandoned land. It is estimated that by 2050, the land destroyed by construction nationwide will reach 60 million mu, while the current reclamation rate in China is only 2%, with great potential. If the advanced country's 50% reclamation rate is used, approximately 30 million mu can be reclaimed. Some can be reclaimed for agricultural use, and some can be developed for construction use.

    At the same time, it is necessary to actively promote the comprehensive reform of the land use system, establish a self-discipline mechanism for treasuring and rationally utilizing land, change the phenomenon of eating the "land communal pot," and change free and unlimited use to paid and limited use.

    Urban land use tax and arable land occupation tax have begun to be levied, and the paid transfer of urban state-owned land use rights and transfer have been piloted in some cities and gradually promoted.

    (3) Vigorously develop science and technology, increase investment, and strive to improve the production efficiency of arable land. Increase investment and improve yields. We often say that it depends on policies, science, and investment. Currently, improving yields mainly depends on increasing investment in arable land. In 1987, China's grain yield per mu was approximately 242 kilograms, and there is potential to improve yields. If by 2050, the yield per mu is increased to 496 kilograms, and if calculated based on 2.176 billion mu of grain sowing area, approximately 552.704 billion kilograms of grain can be increased, equivalent to increasing 1.114 billion mu of arable land. Currently, China's northwestern region has 2 billion mu of dry land, with an average actual yield of only 63 kilograms. Increasing grain yield by 20 kilograms per mu is completely possible. This can increase nearly 5 billion kilograms of grain. As for the southern region with better water and heat conditions and the fertile land in the northeast, the potential of medium and low-yield fields is relatively greater. Currently, China has 1.1 billion mu of medium and low-yield fields, accounting for more than 70% of the total arable land area (based on statistical figures). Therefore, whether in terms of quantity or potential, it is necessary to take the transformation of medium and low-yield fields as an important part of the future agricultural development strategy.

    Appropriately increase the multiple cropping index. According to the research results of relevant departments, with the improvement of China's agricultural production conditions in the future, there is still approximately 10% potential for the multiple cropping index. Each increase of one percentage point in the multiple cropping index is equivalent to increasing the sowing area by 150 to 200 million mu. Therefore, it is necessary to fully utilize China's advantages in light and heat resources, create various conditions for intercropping, relay cropping, and other multiple cropping systems, and strive to increase the multiple cropping index from the current 151.2% to 155% in 2000 and 160% in 2050, equivalent to increasing the sowing area by 1.2 billion and 1.9 billion mu, respectively.

    Strengthen the research on biotechnology and artificial synthesis technology. Solving the contradiction between people and land and the shortage of human food ultimately depends on the breakthrough of biotechnology and artificial synthesis technology. Although this research will take a considerable period before large-scale application, it is a fundamental way to solve the contradiction between people and land and the food problem. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to and strengthen this aspect of research and strive to shorten the breakthrough process.

    (4) Moderate consumption to ease the pressure on China's food demand. In recent years, China has appeared to have the phenomenon of "overconsumption." This is not in line with China's national conditions and financial strength. Therefore, it is very necessary to advocate moderate consumption.

    Gradually change the people's food structure. On the premise of not relaxing grain production, diversify food sources and vigorously develop various foods. Under the current conditions, it is advocated to consume less grain and more animal food; consume less grain-consuming meat and more grass-fed meat; change from drinking white liquor to fruit wine. This is very beneficial for saving grain.

    Develop the feed industry. Currently, the quality of feed in China is poor, and the conversion rate is very low. Currently, it is necessary to improve feed processing technology, turn waste into treasure, and improve feed quality; formulate necessary policies to reasonably utilize various animal protein feed sources. Some experts have estimated that in 1985, approximately 36% of China's grain was used as feed. If part of the grain land is directly changed to feed land, high-quality feed varieties are selected, and the planting density is increased, it is estimated that the feed quantity can be increased by 20% compared to grain planting. This is also an important way to solve China's grain shortage and feed shortage.

    (5) Strengthen the education of national land awareness among the people and create a social environment conducive to the protection of arable land. Conduct national land awareness education for the whole people, further enhance the awareness of the whole society, especially the leading cadres at all levels, to cherish land, and the State Land Administration Bureau conducted a pilot project in Shanxi Province last year, with good results. The experience of Shanxi is now being gradually promoted nationwide. When conducting national land awareness education in various places, it is necessary to combine the crisis of arable land with the rapid increase in population, the shortage of grain, and the development of the social economy to explain the sense of crisis and urgency of the arable land problem, so that every citizen in the country understands China's land conditions and improves the awareness of implementing the basic national policy of treasuring and rationally utilizing every inch of land and effectively protecting arable land.

    (6) Family planning and population control. This is a key measure. If by 2050, the population is controlled at 1.6 billion or even less, then the contradiction between people and land will be greatly eased. If we can ensure the food and construction land needs of tens of billions of people in the extremely sharp contradiction between people and land, it will be a great contribution to the Chinese nation and all of humanity.

    我国耕地的现状、发展趋势与对策
    王先进
    “土地是一切生产和一切存在的源泉”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第2卷109页）。人类的生存和社会的发展，都离不开土地。耕地是土地的精华。人类消费的大部分物质和95％以上的蛋白质取自土地，其中80％以上的热量和75％以上的蛋白质来自耕地提供的粮食。因此，一个国家人均耕地数量和质量及其所提供的物质数量和质量，是该国民族生存、发展的最基本的物质条件。
      我国耕地现状及发展趋势
  人口多，土地少，耕地资源不足，是我国的一项基本国情，是制约我国社会经济发展的一个重要因素。据统计，1949年，我国耕地面积为14.68亿亩。建国初期，我国开荒造田面积超过基本建设占地面积，耕地逐年增加。1957年全国耕地面积扩展到16.77亿亩，比1949年增加2.09亿亩，是我国耕地最多的一年。此后逐年减少，到1986年全国累计减少耕地6.11亿亩，扣除开荒造田3.77亿亩，净减少耕地2.34亿亩。29年间，平均每年减少耕地2107万亩，净减少耕地807万亩。“六五”期间全国共减少耕地8752万亩，开荒造田5063万亩，净减少3689万亩，平均每年减少耕地1720万亩，净减少737万亩。1986年以来，党中央、国务院采取一系列重大措施制止乱占耕地，取得了一定的成效，但未从根本上解决问题。耕地面积减少的原因很多，主要有以下几个方面：
      （一）农业内部结构调整占用耕地失控。前几年，错误地判断了粮食生产形势和农业内部比较效益的作用，不适当地调整农业内部结构，大量耕地改种果树、养鱼或退耕还林、还牧等，是造成耕地面积减少过快的主要因素。1985年，全国农业内部结构调整占用耕地1911.5万亩，占当年耕地减少总数的79.7％；1986年占用1283.5万亩，占当年耕地减少总数的77.2％。耕地面积急剧减少，粮食产量明显下降。1985年全国粮食产量比上年减少2820万吨，其中由于农业内部结构调整占用耕地导致减产约359万吨，占当年粮食减产总数的12.7％。有些地方在调整农业内部结构中，片面强调致富，忽视粮食生产，甚至出现“果下川、粮上山”和撂荒弃耕等现象，至今有的地方仍没有得到有效控制。
      （二）非农业建设占用耕地增多。国家建设占用耕地，“六五”期间平均每年128.6万亩，年占地递增率为21％。有些建设项目在用地上宽打宽用，少用多征，征而不用，以及乱占滥用的现象比较严重。根据对非农业建设用地的清查，全国有40％非农业建设项目违法用地，有些地方高达50％以上。建国40年来，城镇占地面积增加过快过大，有的扩大4至9倍。现在城市建设主要是向外扩展，旧城改造很少。乡村集体建设占用耕地，1985年为139万亩，1986年为87.8万亩，分别占同期非农业建设占用耕地总数的28.4％和23.2％。有些地方毁田建砖瓦窑的情况相当严重。有的乡镇企业占地圈大院，建筑密度很低，浪费土地现象十分突出。农民建房占用耕地1985年为146万亩，1986年为127万亩，分别占同期非农业建设
  占用耕地总数的30.1％和33.3％。农村“建房热”几乎遍及全国，而且多是占平地、好地和超标准占地，有的毁掉上百亩耕地扩建新的村镇。
    （三）耕地自然损毁面积严重。长期以来，由于盲目开荒，滥垦山林、草原等，破坏了生态平衡，导致大量耕地被毁坏。我国水土流失面积，全国解放时为116万平方公里，50年代扩大到150万平方公里，占全国土地总面积的15.6％。30年治理了46万平方公里，但有些地区又有新发展，增减相抵，目前，全国水土流失面积大约为130万平方公里，仍占全国土地总面积的13.5％。每年因洪水、沙化等灾害损毁的耕地约有200万亩，有些地方一次大洪水就冲毁耕地十几万亩甚至几十万亩。
      （四）土地管理体制不适应土地管理工作的需要。《土地管理法》颁布前，我国土地管理工作长期分散在各部门，单靠行政手段管理，土地管理法规和土地管理机构不健全，法规不配套，管理力量薄弱。目前虽已建立土地管理系统，但在一些地区的基层，机构还很不健全，党的政策、国家的法律难以全面贯彻落实。
      （五）土地长期无偿、无限期使用，吃“土地大锅饭”。这不仅使国有土地、集体土地所有权在经济上无法体现，而且也失去了利用经济手段调节土地使用结构和有效地管理土地的可能。助长了多征少用，征而不用，浪费土地现象不断发生。
    我国现在还处在社会主义初级阶段，各项建设还要有一个较大发展。如果达到中等发达国家水平，即2050年以前，各项建设还需要占用多少耕地？我们曾做过一个粗略估计：据全国土地概查统计，我国1985年耕地面积大约19亿亩（国家统计数为14.5亿亩），需要逐步退耕还林、还牧的约1亿亩。按近几年各项建设占用耕地速度，即每年占用300万亩，从1986到2050年共约占用2亿亩。自然灾害损毁耕地每年按150万亩计算，从1986年到2050年损毁约近1亿亩。建设占用、自然损毁、退耕还牧还林三项合计，从1986年到2050年，减少耕地约4亿亩。这期间通过开垦荒地及滩涂开发可能增加2亿亩，最终剩下的耕地只有17亿亩。但那时的人口可能会突破15亿，人均耕地可能会不到1亩。这是制约我国经济发展的一个重要因素。
      解决我国耕地问题的对策
    人们常说我国地大物博。从绝对数来说，我国的土地资源是丰富的，但从人均水平看，土地资源又相当贫乏。所以，我们研究土地问题离不开人口问题。我国用占世界6.8％的耕地，养活着占世界21.8％的人口。目前，我国正处于人口生育高峰期。有人主张，我国可以通过进口解决粮食问题。这是办不到的。这里必须指出：耕地问题的严重性，不仅在于耕地面积的锐减、人口的猛增、人地矛盾的加剧；而且还在于我们一些领导同志没有认识到耕地、人口反向发展导致耕地危机的巨大惯性，缺乏危机感和紧迫感。
    我国耕地人口承载力的潜在危机，是长期困扰我国现代化建设的最大障碍因素之一。必须进行治理、整顿，全面深化改革，从现在抓起，长远规划，统筹安排，综合治理。必须长期坚持“控制人口、节省资源、适度消费”的指导方针，认真贯彻“十分珍惜和合理利用每寸土地，切实保护耕地”的基本国策，为子孙后代保留尽可能多一点的赖以生存、发展的宝贵资源——土地。具体来说，需从以下六个方面着手：
      （一）加快立法，强化管理，千方百计保住现有耕地面积。首先要创造一个有利于保护耕地的法律环境，急需制定耕地保护法。明确规定人均耕地的绝对保护数，制订土地利用总体规划，根据规划划定农田保护区，非农建设用地不得侵占。
    制定各项建设用地标准，控制城镇建设用地规模。我国各项建设用地，至今没有一个科学的、统一的标准。今后我国城镇建设用地应制定标准，一般可按城市人口数量控制城镇建设规模，促使城市节约用地，合理用地。
    交通用地也要严格控制。我国现有交通用地1亿多亩，将来还要大幅度增加。交通用地标准，要符合中国国情。铁路、公路两侧预留地和绿化地要尽量采用工程措施来保证路基和交通安全，尽量少占用耕地。
    我国现有394万多个村，占地近2亿亩，是占地的大头。建议对全国村庄重新进行合理规划。今后凡是有条件的，都要逐步把村庄移到山荒地或劣地，改平房为楼房。如果能将10％的村庄移到荒坡上，可腾出耕地2000多万亩。
    农业内部结构调整，一般也不要占用耕地。近几年来，由于内部结构调整占用耕地，一般占每年耕地减少数的60％左右。今后必须严加控制，凡是占用优质粮田的要逐步退回，对土地违法案件要依法查处，做到依法管地用地。
      （二）有计划有领导地进行土地开发，增加耕地面积，提高耕地质量。有计划地开发有限的耕地后备资源。据初步调查，全国有大片荒地50亿亩，能够开发为耕地的约1.2亿多亩；零星闲散荒地约1亿亩，能开发为耕地的约0.5亿亩。如果对未利用的荒地进行综合开发，宜农则农，宜林则林，宜牧则牧，宜渔则渔，宜建则建（建设用地），合理利用，用开发的耕地补上建设占用的耕地，是完全可能的。
    量力而行，逐步搞好明渠、田埂的改造。目前，全国农田排灌渠道占用宜耕地约近1亿亩，田埂土坎占用耕地几千万亩。如果将部分明渠改造为暗渠，变坡大的田埂为水泥的立埂，估算可增加耕地几千万亩。
    努力提高废弃的复垦率。据预测，到2050年，全国因建设遭到破坏的土地将达6000万亩，而目前我国复垦率只有2％，潜力相当大。如果按先进国家50％的复垦率，则可复垦3000多万亩。有的可复垦为农业用地，有的可开发为建设用地。
    与此同时，还要积极推进土地使用制度全面改革，建立珍惜和合理利用土地的自我约束机制，改变吃土地“大锅饭”的现象，变无偿无限期使用为有偿有限期使用。
    城镇土地使用税和耕地占用税已开始征收，城镇国有土地使用权有偿出让和转让也在一些城市试点，逐步推行。
      （三）大力发展科学技术，增加投入，努力提高耕地生产效益。增加投入，提高单产。我们常说一靠政策、二靠科学、三靠投入。目前，提高单产除依靠政策进一步调动农民种粮的积极性外，主要是增加对耕地的投入。1987年，我国粮食亩产约242公斤，提高单产的潜力是有的。如果到2050年，将单产提高到496公斤，若按21.76亿亩粮食播种面积算，可增加粮食约5527.04亿公斤，相当于增加耕地11.14亿亩。目前，我国西北部有2亿亩旱地，实际产量平均只有63公斤，每亩增产20公斤粮食是完全可能的。这样就可增加近50亿公斤的粮食。至于水利和光热条件较好的南方和土地肥沃的东北，相对来说中低产田的潜力还大一些。现在，我国有中低产田11亿亩，占现在耕地（按统计数字）总面积的70％以上。因此，无论从数量上还是从潜力上看，都应该把改造中低产田作为今后农业发展战略中的重要一环。
    适当提高复种指数。据有关部门研究的结果表明，今后随着我国农业生产条件的改善，大致还有10％的复种指数的潜力。复种指数每增加一个百分点，就相当于增加1500万到2000万亩的播种面积。因此，充分利用我国光热资源优势，创造各种条件利用间作、套种等多熟制，争取复种指数从现在的151.2％增加到2000年的155％和2050年的160％，相当于分别增加播种面积1.2亿和1.9亿亩。
    加强生物技术和人工合成技术的研究。解决人地矛盾、人类食物的短缺问题，最终要靠生物技术和人工合成技术取得突破。尽管这项研究到大面积应用还要经过一个相当长的过程，但这是一条从根本上解决人地矛盾和粮食问题的途径。因此，必须重视、加强这方面的研究，力争缩短突破的进程。
      （四）适度消费，以缓解我国粮食需求上的压力。近两年，我国却出现了“超前消费”的现象。这同我国的国情与国家财力很不相适应。因此，非常有必要提倡适度消费。
    逐步改变人民的食物结构。在决不放松粮食生产的前提下，广辟食物来源，大力发展多种食物，在现有条件下，应提倡少消耗一些粮食，多吃一些动物类食物；提倡少吃一些消耗粮食的肉类，多吃一些草食肉类；提倡改喝白酒为果酒。这对节约粮食十分有利。
    发展饲料工业。目前，我国饲料质量差、转化率很低。当前一要提高饲料加工技术，变无用为有用，提高饲料质量；二要制定必要的政策，合理利用各种动物性蛋白饲料源。有的专家测算，1985年我国约有36％的粮食用作饲料，如果直接将部分粮食用地改作饲料地，选用优良饲料品种，加大种植密度，估计可以比种粮提高20％的饲料量。这也是解决我国粮食短缺和饲料不足的一条重要途径。
      （五）加强全民国土观念教育，造成一个有利于保护耕地的社会环境。进行全民国土观念教育，进一步增强全社会特别是各级领导干部珍惜土地的意识，国家土地管理局去年已在山西省进行了试点，效果很好。现正在逐步向全国推广山西的经验。各地在进行全民国土观念教育时，应把耕地的危机与人口的猛增、粮食的不足和社会经济的发展结合起来讲，才能讲清楚耕地问题的危机感和紧迫性，使全国每个公民都了解我国土地的国情，提高贯彻执行珍惜、合理利用每寸土地，切实保护耕地基本国策的自觉性。
      （六）计划生育，控制人口。这是一项关键措施。如果到2050年，人口控制在16亿或再少一些，那么，人地矛盾就会有很大的缓解。如果我们能在人地矛盾极端尖锐的情况下，保证十几亿人的吃饭和建设用地需要，对中华民族和整个人类将是一大贡献。
