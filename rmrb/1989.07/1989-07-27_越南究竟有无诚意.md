The international conference on the Cambodian issue will be held in Paris on July 30. This conference is another important step towards a political solution to the Cambodian problem and has received widespread attention from the international community. People hope that this international conference will lead to a comprehensive, lasting, and fair resolution of the Cambodian issue, which has lasted for a decade. However, there are also concerns about the prospects of the conference, as Vietnam still maintains its stubborn stance on some key aspects of the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Firstly, Vietnam firmly opposes and rejects the joint statement of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Conference on the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue. At the beginning of this month, this statement was published and immediately attacked and criticized by Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime as "creating obstacles," "regressing," "illogical," and "demanding too much." This shows that Vietnam does not want a comprehensive resolution to the Cambodian issue but advocates splitting the issue into "external" and "internal" parts to be solved separately, and strives to make the "external" issue an "internal" one, thereby legitimizing the Phnom Penh regime. On the one hand, Vietnam wants to prove that it will no longer interfere in Cambodia's "internal affairs" by "completely withdrawing its troops." On the other hand, it continues to maintain its interests in Cambodia through "hiding soldiers" and "migrating" people, helping the Phnom Penh regime to establish a foothold, and attributing these issues to "internal Cambodian problems" to be solved by the Cambodian people themselves. Vietnam also uses "stopping external aid" as an additional condition for complete withdrawal, in order to make the resistance forces unable to resist the "Phnom Penh regime." This is what Vietnam is preparing to discuss at the Paris International Conference as the so-called "external issue," which is also the reason why Vietnam is not in a hurry to solve the "internal issue."

On July 25, Hun Sen, after the four-party talks in Paris ended in disarray, again claimed that the "Paris International Conference has no right to handle the issue of national reconciliation," and its main task should be to "discuss the issue of Vietnamese withdrawal of troops, as well as the parallel issue of stopping external aid and preventing the Khmer Rouge from regaining power." He did not mention the truly "external issue" of supervising the Vietnamese withdrawal through an "international supervisory body." According to the spokesperson of the KPNLF, at the four-party roundtable meeting, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea proposed and insisted on the United Nations organizing an international supervisory body and building an international peacekeeping force, but this was rejected by Hun Sen. Hun Sen claimed that Vietnam's stance on this issue has not changed. Since Vietnam announced the "complete withdrawal" by the end of September, many countries around the world have unanimously demanded effective supervision of the Vietnamese withdrawal. The ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Conference advocates that the Paris International Conference should produce an international supervisory body and an international peacekeeping force led and participated by the United Nations. However, Vietnam has consistently rejected this on the condition that the United Nations must "leave the Cambodian seat vacant and correct past erroneous resolutions."

The ASEAN countries believe that to change the situation of Cambodia's seat in the United Nations, the first thing to look at is whether the Paris International Conference can reach an agreement on the formation of a Cambodian four-party interim joint government. ASEAN and countries advocating justice around the world demand and support the establishment of a Cambodian four-party interim joint government led by Prince Sihanouk, including the Khmer Rouge, to avoid internal war after the Vietnamese withdrawal. It is precisely on this key issue that Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime are extremely stubborn, insisting on excluding the Khmer Rouge. This round of meetings between Sihanouk and Hun Sen, as well as the four-party talks, all failed due to Hun Sen's insistence on this stance. Hun Sen even opposes the participation of the "Khmer Rouge" and Son Sann in the Paris International Conference, advocating that only he and Prince Sihanouk should be the representatives. Prince Sihanouk pointed out that Hun Sen's proposal is an attempt to make the international community recognize the Phnom Penh regime's sole control as a fait accompli.

It is worth noting that Vietnam not only has such ambitions politically but also has military actions. Recently, the Vietnamese army has launched a frenzied attack on the Cambodian resistance forces, attempting to gain more territory for the "Phnom Penh regime" as a bargaining chip for the Paris International Conference. Since July 20, Vietnam has particularly launched a full-scale attack on the resistance forces in the Cambodian-Thai border area, even targeting Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand. A Thai military spokesman pointed out that Vietnam's current military actions violate its promise to withdraw its troops 30 kilometers from the Cambodian-Thai border, indicating that it is still insincere and has no intention of truly solving the problem.

Observers here believe that if Vietnam and the Phnom Penh regime do not change the above-mentioned stance, it will inevitably have an adverse impact on the upcoming Paris International Conference and disrupt the process of comprehensively resolving the Cambodian issue.

    越南究竟有无诚意
    本报记者　刘爱成
    关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议将于7月30日在巴黎举行。这次会议是政治解决柬问题的又一个重要步骤，得到国际社会的普遍重视。人们希望这次国际会议能使持续了10年之久的柬问题获得全面、持久和公正合理的解决，但同时又不免对会议前景有些担忧，因为越南在政治解决柬问题的一些关键方面至今仍坚持其顽固立场。
    首先，越南坚决反对和拒绝东盟外长会议关于全面解决柬问题的联合声明。本月初，这项声明一发表，就被越南及金边政权攻击和指责为“制造障碍”、“倒退”、“不合逻辑”和“要价太高”等。这说明越南不想全面解决柬埔寨问题，而是主张把柬问题分割成“外部”和“内部”两个部分分开来解决，并竭力使“外部”问题“内部”化，从而使金边政权合法化。越南一方面想以
  “全部撤军”来证明它“今后不再管柬埔寨的‘内部事务’了”，另一方面却又以
  “藏兵”和“移民”手段继续维护其在柬埔寨的既得利益，帮助金边政权站稳脚跟，并把这些问题统统归于“柬内部问题”，“由柬人民自己解决”。越南还以
  “停止外援”作为全部撤军的附加条件，以便使抵抗力量无力抵抗“金边政权”。这就是越南准备在巴黎国际会议上讨论的所谓“外部问题”，也就是越南为什么不着急解决“内部问题”的原因。
    7月25日，洪森在巴黎四方会谈不欢而散之后再次声称，“巴黎国际会议无权处理民族和解问题”，其主要任务应是“讨论越南撤军问题，以及与此‘平行’的停止外援和阻止红色高棉重新掌权问题”。他不提真正属于“外部问题”的监督越南撤军的“国际监督机构”问题。据民柬发言人说，在四方圆桌会议上，民柬联合政府提出和坚持由联合国出面组织国际监督机构及组建国际维持和平部队，但遭洪森拒绝。洪森声称，越南在这个问题上的立场没有改变。自越南宣布9月底“全部撤军”以来，世界许多国家一致要求对越南撤军进行切实有效的监督。东盟外长会议主张由巴黎国际会议产生一个由联合国参加和领导的国际监督机构和国际维持和平部队。但越南一直以联合国必须“使柬席位空缺，并改正过去的错误决议”为先决条件加以拒绝。
    东盟国家认为，要使柬埔寨在联合国的席位问题上有所变化，首先要看巴黎国际会议能否就组成柬四方临时联合政府达成协议。东盟及世界主持正义国家都要求和支持建立一个由西哈努克亲王领导的、包括红色高棉在内的柬四方临时联合政府，以避免在越南撤军后发生内战。恰恰在这个关键问题上，越南及金边政权极为顽固，坚持排除红色高棉。这次西洪会晤及四方会谈都因洪森坚持这一立场而归于失败。洪森甚至反对“红色高棉”及宋双参加巴黎国际会议，主张只要他和西哈努克亲王作为代表就行了。西哈努克亲王指出，洪森的这一主张是企图使国际社会承认金边政权独家掌权的既成事实。
    值得指出的是，越南不仅在政治上有此野心，在军事上也有所动作。最近，越军疯狂地进攻柬抵抗力量，企图为“金边政权”打下更多地盘，作为在巴黎国际会议上讨价还价的筹码。自本月20日以来，越南尤其在柬泰边境地区全面攻击抵抗力量阵地，连设在泰国境内的柬难民营也不放过。泰国军方发言人指出，越南目前的军事行动违背了它关于将其部队撤离柬泰边境30公里的诺言，这表明它仍然口是心非，无意真正解决问题。
    此间观察家认为，如果越南及金边政权不改变上述立场，必然给即将召开的巴黎国际会议带来不利影响，破坏全面解决柬埔寨问题的进程。
