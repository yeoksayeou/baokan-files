With the development of the commodity economy, the circulation of goods between regions has become increasingly vibrant, and local products are competing with those from other regions. However, some regions have put up a "red light" to this competition. In some places, external goods entering the region must pay so-called "management fees"; in others, prices are manipulated to suppress competitors, making it impossible to do business even if the goods are of high quality; in yet others, it is stipulated that local people should buy local products.

These practices are driven by narrow, local interests. Fees are collected here, and barriers are set up there, hindering the development of high-quality products and the normal circulation and fair competition of goods. The practice of regional protectionism is essentially about supporting the inferior and limiting the superior. High-quality local products do not need administrative protection, but those that need protection are the products that should have been eliminated or replaced long ago. Conversely, the products excluded are those that pose a threat to the inferior local products. Ultimately, the victims are the state and the consumers.

Why is regional trade protectionism on the rise at present? The main reason is that in recent years, the fiscal decentralization system has strengthened regional interests. Some places, in order to protect their own regional interests, fiercely protect local enterprises and local products, even those with disadvantages, to prevent them from being overwhelmed by superior enterprises and high-quality products from other regions. The historical root of this problem is the closed-minded mentality. In the past, market competition was not intense, the impact was small, and the contradictions were not obvious. Now, with the competition of goods, which relates to the development prospects of some enterprises and some products, this contradiction has become prominent.

In a socialist commodity economy, competition should be fair and rule-based; it should not be subject to unfair restrictions or attacks. Through equal competition, laggards can be motivated to catch up with the advanced, thus narrowing the gap. This is a powerful lever for promoting economic development. Therefore, to ensure the rapid development of the socialist commodity economy, an important issue is to break up "feudalism" and connect the market.

    打破“割据”沟通市场
    陈士增　张宝华　王锦瑞
    随着商品经济的发展，地区之间的商品流通越来越兴旺，本地产品与外地产品拉开了竞争之势，但是，有的地区却对这种竞争亮出了“红灯”。有的地方，外地产品入境要收所谓“管理费”；有的用价格限制别人，尽管你的商品好，还是要压你的价，让你赔钱买卖没法做；有的提出，本地人要买本地货。
    这类作法，是从小圈子利益出发的。这里收费，那里设卡，影响优质产品的发展，影响商品正常流通和公平竞争。地方保护的做法实质是扶劣限优。因为本地出的好产品用不着采取行政手段去保护，需要保护的只是那些早就该淘汰或更新换代的产品；反之，被拒之门外的则是那些对当地次货有冲击力的商品。这样，最终受害的是国家和消费者。
    地区贸易保护主义为什么在目前抬头呢？主要是近几年来，财政分灶的体制强化了地区利益，一些地方为了自己地区的利益，拚命保护本地企业，本地产品，即便是劣势企业、劣质产品也要保起来，以免被外地优势企业、优质产品冲垮。其历史根源则是封闭意识在作怪。过去市场竞争不激烈，冲击力小，矛盾不明显，现在商品竞争，关系到一些企业、一些产品的发展前途时，这个矛盾突出了。
    在社会主义商品经济中，竞争应该有条件，有规则；但不能受不公平的限制，遭打击。通过平等竞争，可以激励后进者更快地赶上先进，从而缩小差距。这正是推动经济发展的一个强有力的杠杆。所以，要使社会主义商品经济有个较快的发展，一个重要的问题就是，打破“割据”，沟通市场。
