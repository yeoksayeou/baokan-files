On April 8, the leadership of Lianwater County, Jiangsu Province, received a tip-off. The caller said that several mid-level officials from the county had gone to Fangdu Township to inspect work and had accepted a lunch invitation involving alcohol. This county leader immediately instructed the Supervision Bureau to investigate. After verification, four decisions were made: (1) The relevant unit leaders were instructed to criticize and educate the individuals involved; (2) Fines were imposed according to regulations, both on those who drank and those who provided the alcohol; (3) The incident was reported throughout the county; (4) The county radio station broadcasted the incident to the entire county. The public applauded this, praising, "The county committee's anti-corruption efforts are truly effective, and they have gained the trust of the people."

Lianwater County's anti-corruption efforts are not just about making rules but about taking concrete actions. They focused on issues that the public cares about and has strong opinions on: cups, children, and houses. By combining anti-corruption institutions with actions, they achieved good results in a short period. Previously, this county had a serious problem with extravagant banquets, and the county had issued various regulations, but due to lack of enforcement, the results were not significant. This year, in March, the county committee and county government reaffirmed the importance of anti-corruption and decided to impose heavy penalties on violators. It was clearly stipulated that whether county officials were going to the countryside or township officials were going to the villages, no one was allowed to drink alcohol. Violators would be fined 20 yuan for each person who drank, and those who provided the alcohol would be fined 50 yuan. Anyone who discovered violations could report to the county discipline inspection committee or supervision bureau, and could also directly call or write to the county committee secretary or county magistrate. The county guaranteed that every reported case would be investigated. To mobilize the public to effectively supervise, the county issued this "regulation" to all units in the county, including village party branches, and published it in the _Lianwater Science and Technology News_ with a circulation of 85,000 copies. It was also broadcast multiple times on the county's cable radio. Because the county committee and county government were resolute in addressing the "cup" issue and enforced strict investigations, the long-standing practice of using public funds for banquets has been curbed.

Recently, the higher authorities allocated 50 positions for contracted township and town officials to Lianwater County. According to the 1:3 ratio, each township and town was required to collectively research and determine 150 candidates to participate in the official selection exam. However, during the exam, 41 "connections" were secretly added. After receiving feedback from the public, the county committee standing committee immediately discussed and decided to disqualify all those who were added later; the exam list was published for public supervision. Since then, there have been no letters from the public regarding this issue. At the beginning of this year, the county labor bureau was responsible for recruiting 230 full-time and collective contract workers, with 2,200 applicants. After the exam scores were released, the labor bureau publicly posted the list and asked everyone to supervise. Within a few days, the county labor bureau received 74 letters from the public, exposing 39 people who had impersonated others to take the exam. After verification, 19 people were firmly disqualified. A relative of a leading cadre, although their score exceeded the passing line, violated the recruitment regulations. This old cadre went to the labor bureau to "intervene," but the bureau director said, "Now, everyone is supervising, and no one can do illegal things."

Some officials and staff in the government offices illegally occupied land and built houses in the county's planned urban area, which is another issue that the public strongly opposes. At the beginning of this year, Lianwater County Committee and County Government specially established a cleanup and investigation team led by a county committee deputy secretary and a deputy county magistrate to conduct a 46-day investigation and cleanup. For the 300-plus households that had built houses since 1987 without proper land use conditions or approval, they were all dealt with according to their specific situations. A dual-income household in the county government had, in addition to occupying public housing, also occupied two plots of land. In this cleanup, they were severely punished.

At the same time, the county committee and county government also studied and formulated the "Temporary Regulations on Strengthening Land Management in the County's Urban Planning Area" and the "Opinions on Solving the Housing Problem for Officials and Staff of Institutions Stationed in the County," clearly stating the conditions, standards, and procedures for private housing construction, and made them public. To prevent some cadres from using their power to occupy land and build houses in the county, the county has made stricter regulations for cadres at the section level and above to build houses. In addition to going through the normal procedures that everyone must follow, those in the party committee sequence must be reviewed by the discipline inspection committee, and those in the government sequence must be reviewed by the supervision bureau. The review content includes: checking if the procedures are complete; checking if the source of funds is reasonable; checking if the source of building materials is legitimate; and checking if there is any private dealings between the construction unit's responsible person and the house builder.

    从杯子、孩子、房子抓起
    ——涟水县廉政建设纪事
    4月8日，江苏省涟水县委领导接到一个举报电话。电话说：县里有几个中层干部到方渡乡检查工作，中午接受招待喝了酒。这个县委领导当即责成监察局前往调查，经核实后，作出四条处理决定：（1）责成有关单位领导对当事人进行批评教育；（2）按规定罚款，既罚喝酒的，也罚备酒的；（3）通报全县；（4）县广播站向全县广播。对此，群众拍手称快，称赞说：“县委抓廉政建设真是言必行，行必果，取信于民。”
    涟水县抓廉政建设不在“条文”上做文章，而在行动上讲实效。他们从群众普遍关心、反映强烈的杯子、孩子和房子抓起，把廉政建设的制度和行动紧密结合起来，在较短的时间内取得了较好的效果。以前，这个县的吃喝风比较盛行，县里也下过这样那样的条文，但是由于抓得不力，总是收效不大。今年3月，县委、县政府重申廉政的意义，对违纪者要重罚。明确规定：无论是县里干部下乡，还是乡里干部到村，任何人都不得喝酒。违反者，下去喝酒的，每人补交酒菜钱20元；备酒招待的，罚款50元。任何人发现违反规定的，都可以向县纪委或监察局反映，并可直接向县委书记、县长打电话、写信，县里保证有一件查处一件。为了发动群众进行有效监督，县里将这一“规定”通知到全县包括村党支部在内的所有单位，还在发行量达8.5万份的《涟水科技报》上刊登，并通过有线广播向全县多次播出。由于县委、县政府抓“杯子”问题态度坚决，查处有力，久禁不止的用公款吃喝之风现已刹住。
    不久前，上级下达给该县招收50名乡镇合同干部指标，按1∶3的比例，要求各乡镇集体研究确定150名对象参加招干考试。但在后来考试时又悄悄安插了41名“关系户”。在接到干群反映后，县委常委立即研究，决定对后排上的人一律除名；将考试名单公布于众，接受群众监督。在这以后，没有一起人民来信反映这方面的问题。今年初，县劳动局负责招收230名全民、集体合同制工人，报考人数达2200名。考试分数出来以后，劳动局把名单张榜公布，并要求大家进行监督。几天内，县劳动局先后收到人民来信74封，其中揭发冒名顶替参加考试的39人，经查实的19人，都被坚决地退了回去。有位领导干部的亲属虽然成绩超过了录取分数线，但违反了招工简章有关规定。这位老干部找到劳动局想“拉弯子”，劳动局长说：“现在靠大家监督，违章的事谁也不能办。”
    机关少数干部职工在县城规划区内非法占地违章建房，是廉政建设中群众反映强烈的又一个问题。今年初，涟水县委、县政府专门成立了由一位县委副书记和一位副县长负责的清理调查组，进行了为期46天的调查清理工作，对清理出的1987年以来的不符合用地条件或没有批准手续的300多修房户，分别不同情况都一一作了处理。县机关有个双职工家庭，除了占公房以外，又占了两份宅基地。在这次清理中，受到严肃处理。
    与此同时，县委、县政府还研究制定了《关于加强县城规划区土地管理的暂行规定》和《关于解决驻城机关干部职工住房问题的意见》，明确了私人建房的条件、标准和办理程序等，向群众公开。为了防止某些干部利用职权在县城占地建房，该县对股级以上干部建房，作出了更加严格的规定，除按一般人所必须经过的正常程序办理外，属于党委序列的要经纪委审查，属政府序列的要经监察局审查。审查内容，一看手续完不完备；二看资金来源合不合理；三看建筑材料来路正不正当；四看承建单位负责人与建房人之间有无私弊。三十六名被冲散的官兵陷入围困。
