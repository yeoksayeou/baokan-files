Tangshan's 15 salt fields, with 16,000 salt workers, have stayed at their posts and worked tirelessly to complete and exceed this year's raw salt production target ahead of schedule.

By mid-June, the city had produced 1.75 million tons of raw salt. The Nánbǔ Xīnshēng Salt Field, which accounts for 69% of the city's salt production area, has adhered to the methods of "early pool flooding, early processing, early salt harvesting, early sorting and drying, early brine pouring, and early start of work," achieving the highest production level in history.
