The July skies of Moscow are clear and blue, and flowers are in full bloom. During this enchanting summer, the Chinese Disabled Artists Troupe, carrying the deep affection of 51.64 million disabled people and 1.1 billion Chinese people, visited the hometown of Lenin to perform for the first time since the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations.

Here, 19 performers from various parts of China, including the blind, deaf-mute, and physically disabled, won thunderous applause with their melodious voices, graceful dance moves, and skilled performances, captivating one audience after another.

“…Healthy people and disabled people, we belong to the same planet, we share the same four seasons, we are all children of the earth. We may not be able to shake hands when we meet, or greet each other when we encounter, but we exchange feelings with our hearts.

Dear comrades and friends! What we are about to present to you is an unusual performance, and the performers who will take the stage are a special group of actors…”

Before the announcer’s words had finished, a group of girls from the Wa Mountains, dressed in ethnic costumes, danced gracefully towards the audience. They danced so joyfully and rhythmically that no one could have imagined they were deaf-mutes who could neither hear nor sing a note.

Under the guidance of a sign language teacher, 11 deaf-mute youths in their twenties performed dances such as "The Girls of Daban City," "Tea Offering to Dear Ones," "Youth on a Festival Day," "Dreaming of Light," and "Hometown Feelings," each of which left the audience spellbound. Especially the sign language poem "A Tilted but Beautiful World," this heart-stirring ode resonated deeply with the Soviet audience, and many deaf-mutes were moved to tears.

The solo performances of the Huqing and Bawo by the physically disabled Zhang Zuyi showcased the unique charm of Chinese national instruments to the Soviet audience for the first time. The pipa and guzheng solos by blind musicians Liu Xuejun and Wang Yiping transported the audience to a distant, magical ancient land.

Of course, the most popular and awe-inspiring performance was the "Eagle Disco" by the physically disabled youths Sun Jishu and Chen Yiqian from Zibo, Shandong. When the two one-legged youths, propped up by crutches, threw away their crutches and performed a 360-degree forward roll from a high platform, the audience's hearts were gripped. At first, everyone held their breath, watching every move of the "eagle." Then, following the rhythm of the music, they started clapping, and finally, everyone stood up from their seats. "Bravo!" "Bravo!" The cheers echoed throughout the hall. The Soviet friends expressed their gratitude and respect for these two disabled youths who refused to yield to fate with flowers, applause, and flying kisses.

In this way, the troupe performed 10 shows in Moscow, Rostov-on-Don, and Leningrad, each of which caused a great sensation and strong response.

During the performances, it was often the case that the performers on stage were special Chinese actors, while the audience below were special Soviet spectators—blind, deaf-mute, and physically disabled individuals. In Moscow, many disabled individuals entered the performance hall in wheelchairs. Some wheeled their chairs to the front of the stage, frequently raising their cameras to capture the exciting moments; others gave a thumbs up, tears welling up in their eyes, saying to the Chinese friends, "It's incredible, wonderful! Wonderful!"

In Leningrad, many deaf-mute spectators surrounded our deaf-mute performers after the show. They communicated using sign language, exchanging smiles and laughter. A sign language teacher standing nearby told us that gestures and facial expressions are the best tools for deaf-mute people from different countries to communicate their thoughts, surpassing any language in the world.

The most touching moment was during an outdoor performance in Rostov's Gorky Park. The scheduled performance time was 5 PM, but by 2:30 PM, the 1,000-seat outdoor theater was almost full. It was a scorching day, with the sun blazing down on the audience. Despite repeated announcements over the loudspeakers that the performance was still two hours away, the audience endured the heat, patiently waiting for the show to start.

Rostov was a key city for the Chinese Disabled Artists Troupe's visit. In addition to performances, they visited disabled workshops and had gatherings and discussions with the locals. Wherever the troupe went, the enthusiastic Cossacks of the Don River welcomed the distant guests with bread and salt according to local customs. During the troupe's five-day stay in Rostov, they received five large loaves of bread. As they prepared to leave, the hospitable hosts gave each member of the troupe a key to the city of Rostov, welcoming them to visit again.

In the Don River, the story of Chinese singer Sun Xiaomei recognizing Aunt Lydia as her Soviet "mother" has become a famous tale. That day, when Xiaomei finished singing a Soviet song on stage, a 60-something Cossack woman suddenly rushed onto the stage, embraced Xiaomei, and repeatedly called out, "My daughter! My daughter!" The next day before the performance, the old lady arrived early with flowers, waiting for her daughter's arrival. They embraced again. As they parted, Aunt Lydia gave Xiaomei her address, repeatedly urging the Chinese daughter not to forget to write to her mother...

Kichkin, a member of the Leningrad Deaf-Mute Association's Presidium who had participated in the anti-Japanese war in Northeast China, excitedly referred to the Chinese Disabled Artists Troupe as "the first swallow of spring." He said, "I am nearly 70 years old, and I have been away from China for over 40 years. Seeing your performance this time has left me amazed. From your performances, we have learned a lot. This performance not only reflects the intelligence and talent of Chinese disabled people but also reflects the spirit of the Chinese people."

Half a month has passed. On the evening of July 10, the Chinese Disabled Artists Troupe returned to their homeland, carrying with them the friendship of Soviet disabled people and the Soviet people. The visit has ended, but the seeds of friendship will take root and bloom in the hearts of the people of both countries.

    特殊演员的不寻常演出
    唐修哲　孙润玉
    7月的莫斯科，碧空如洗，鲜花盛开。在这迷人的仲夏季节，中国残疾人艺术团带着全中国5164万残疾人和11亿中国人民的深厚情意来到列宁的故乡，进行了中苏两国关系正常化后的第一次访问演出。
    在这里，19名来自中国各地的盲人、聋哑人和肢残人以婉转的歌喉、优美的舞姿、娴熟的技艺赢得了一阵又一阵热烈掌声，征服了一批又一批苏联观众。
    “……健全人和残疾人，我们属于同一个星球，我们拥有一样的冬夏春秋，我们同在世界上，都是大地的孩子。相见也许不能握手，相逢也许无法问候，但我们用心灵把感情交流。
    亲爱的同志们，朋友们！即将奉献给您的是一场不寻常的演出，将要登上舞台的是一批特殊的演员……”
    报幕员的话音未落，一批身着民族服装的佤山少女踏着轻盈的舞步向观众走来。她们跳得是那样欢快，节拍是那样的分明，有谁能想到她们是什么声音也听不见，什么音符也唱不出的聋哑人呢？
    在手语老师的指导下，11名20岁左右的聋哑青年表演的《达板城的姑娘》、《奶茶献亲人》、《节日的小伙》、《觅光梦》和《故乡情》等舞蹈无一不使观众倾倒。尤其是手语诗《倾斜而美丽的世界》，这首催人向上的心灵的颂歌引起了苏联观众的强烈共鸣，不少聋哑人激动地流下了热泪。
    肢残人张祖豫的葫芦丝和巴乌独奏第一次向苏联观众展示了中国民族乐器独具的魅力。盲人音乐家刘学军和王宜平的琵琶、古筝独奏更把人带到了遥远神奇的古国。
    当然，最受人欢迎、最令人折服的还数山东淄博肢残青年孙即树和陈义前合演的《雄鹰迪斯科》。当两位支撑着拐杖的独腿青年扔掉双拐，从高台上来了一个360度前滚翻飞身而下时，观众的心弦被抽紧了。开始，人们屏气凝息地注视着“雄鹰”的每一个动作，随后跟着音乐的节奏鼓起掌来，最后，大家情不自禁地从座位上站了起来。“勃拉沃”！“勃拉沃”！（“好极了”！“好极了”！）的喝采声响彻整个大厅。苏联朋友用鲜花，用掌声，用飞吻来表达对这两位不愿向命运屈服的身残青年的感激和敬意。
    就这样，艺术团在莫斯科、顿河罗斯托夫和列宁格勒先后演出了10场，场场都引起了很大的轰动和强烈的反响。
    演出时经常遇到这样的情况：台上表演的是中国特殊的演员，台下坐着的是苏联特殊的观众——他们同是盲人、聋哑人和肢残人。在莫斯科，不少肢残人是乘着轮椅直接进入演出厅的。他们有的把轮椅摇到台前，不时地举起相机，拍摄下精彩的镜头；有的伸出大拇指，满含热泪对中国朋友说：“真是不可思议，太好了！太好了！”
    在列宁格勒，不少聋哑观众在散场后围住我们的聋哑演员，他们用手语比划着，交谈着，不时发出会心的微笑。站在一旁的手语老师告诉我们：手势和面部表情是各国聋哑人思想交流的最好工具，它胜过了世界上任何一种语言。
    最令人感动的是在罗斯托夫高尔基公园的一场露天演出。预定开演的时间是下午5点，但2点多钟1000多座位的露天剧场几乎就已坐满了人。那是一个酷暑的日子，烈日当空，炽热的阳光直射在观众的身上。尽管广播喇叭里一再通知离演出还有两个多小时，但观众不怕暴晒，依然耐心地等待着开演。
    罗斯托夫是中国残疾人艺术团此次访问的重点城市。除演出外，还参观了残疾人工厂、并和他们联欢、座谈。艺术团每到一处，热情的顿河哥萨克都要按照当地的习俗用面包和盐来迎接远道而来的贵宾。在罗斯托夫逗留的短短5天里，艺术团就收到了5只大面包。临别时，好客的主人还赠给每位团员一把罗斯托夫市的钥匙，欢迎他们再次光临。
    在顿河，中国女歌手孙晓梅认利季娅大婶为苏联干妈的故事已传为佳话。那天，当晓梅在台上演唱完一首苏联歌曲时，一位60多岁的哥萨克妇女突然激动地走到台上，拥抱了晓梅，口中不断地叫着：“我的女儿！”“我的女儿！”第二天演出前，老太太一早就手持鲜花等待着女儿的到来，她们再次依偎在一起。临别时，利季娅大婶给晓梅留下了地址，再三叮嘱中国女儿别忘了给妈妈写信……
    当年曾在中国东北参加过抗日战争的列宁格勒聋哑人协会主席团成员基奇金激动地把中国残疾人艺术团称作“第一只春燕”。他说，我已年近70，离开中国已有40多年，这次看到了你们的演出，使我颇为惊叹。从你们的表演中我们学到了不少东西，这次演出不仅反映了中国残疾人的聪敏才智，更反映了中国人民的精神面貌。
    半个月的时间过去了。7月10日晚，中国残疾人艺术团满载着苏联残疾人和苏联人民的友谊离开莫斯科飞回祖国。访问结束了，但播下的友谊种子将在两国人民心中生根、开花。
