Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd.

The 22nd annual meeting of the foreign ministers of the six ASEAN countries began today in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei. The main agenda item is the discussion of the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

Brunei's Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, in his opening remarks, called on all parties involved to make "greater efforts" to achieve a comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue, so that the region can "transform from a conflict-ridden area into a peaceful, economically developed, and cooperative region."

He also emphasized the importance of economic cooperation among ASEAN countries, stating that "generally, economic confrontation harms peace." He urged ASEAN member states to expand cooperation and coordination in economic development.

The ASEAN foreign ministers, in their opening speeches, all stressed the need for a comprehensive political resolution of the Cambodian issue. They pointed out that a partial resolution could lead to internal conflict in Cambodia.

Singapore's Foreign Minister Wong Kan Seng noted: "Southeast Asia cannot accept an Afghan-style resolution, where internal factions continue to clash even after the cessation of external interference."

This ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting is being held at a critical juncture in the political resolution of the Cambodian issue, attracting international attention. The quadripartite talks on Cambodia and the international conference on the Cambodian issue are scheduled to be held in Paris at the end of this month and in August, respectively.

In their informal discussions, the six ASEAN foreign ministers drafted an eight-point outline on the Cambodian issue. The outline emphasizes that the Cambodian issue must be resolved "comprehensively," and not in two parts as advocated by Vietnam—domestic and international. The outline states: "The only way to ensure a fair and permanent resolution of the Cambodian issue and to promote long-term stability in the region is to resolve the domestic and international aspects of the issue as a whole through a comprehensive political solution."

The outline notes that the ASEAN foreign ministers have taken note of Vietnam's announced withdrawal plans, but "these plans do not fall within the scope of a comprehensive political resolution of the Cambodian issue." The foreign ministers believe that the political resolution has "entered a critical stage," and therefore, efforts must be redoubled.

The foreign ministers support the establishment of an international supervisory body or peacekeeping force to oversee Vietnam's withdrawal and post-withdrawal elections in Cambodia. They reiterated their support for the establishment of a quadripartite provisional joint government in Cambodia, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk.

The 22nd ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting will last for two days. Following this, a meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers and dialogue partner foreign ministers will be held to discuss economic cooperation issues. The dialogue partners are: the United States, Japan, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the European Community.

    东盟外长会议在文莱开幕
    呼吁政治解决柬埔寨问题促进地区经济发展与合作
    据新华社北京7月3日电  文莱消息：东盟6国外长们于今天开始在文莱国首都斯里巴加湾港举行第22届年会，会议的主要议题是讨论柬埔寨问题的政治解决。
    文莱苏丹哈桑纳尔·博尔基亚在开幕式上致词，呼吁有关各方面作出“更大努力”来使柬埔寨问题得到合理解决，以便使本地区“从一个冲突的地区变成一个和平的、经济发展和合作的地区”。
    他还强调了东盟国家间经济合作的重要性，因为，“一般来说，经济对抗会损害和平”。他要求东盟成员国在经济发展中扩大合作和协调。
    东盟外长们在开幕式的发言中都强调要使柬埔寨问题得到全面的政治解决，并指出，仅部分解决可能会使柬埔寨问题演变成内战。
    新加坡外长黄根成在发言中指出：“东南亚不能接受一个阿富汗式的解决方法，阿富汗国内各派在停止外部干涉的情况下仍加剧冲突。”
    本届东盟外长会议是在政治解决柬埔寨问题进入关键阶段的时刻举行的，因而引起国际舆论的关注。柬埔寨四方圆桌会谈和柬埔寨问题国际会议将分别于本月底及8月份在巴黎举行。
    东盟6国外长在其非正式会谈中曾制订了一项有关柬埔寨问题的8点提纲。提纲强调柬埔寨问题必须“一揽子”解决，而不能像越南主张的那样，分成国内和国际两个部分去解决。提纲说：“确保柬埔寨问题公正而永久解决、促使本地区长期稳定的唯一办法是通过全面的政治解决来使这个问题的国内和国际方面作为一个整体加以解决。”
    提纲指出，东盟外长们注意到越宣布过的撤军计划，但是，“这些计划并不属于全面政治解决柬问题的范畴。”外长们认为，政治解决“已进入关键阶段”，因而必须加倍努力。
    外长们支持设立一个国际监督机构或维持和平部队来监督越南撤军及撤军后在柬的选举。他们重申支持在柬埔寨成立一个以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府。
    第22届东盟外长会议将进行两天。接着，将举行东盟外长与对话国外长会议，讨论经济合作问题。对话国是：美国、日本、加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰以及欧洲共同体。
