Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 21st.

According to a recent meeting on the logistical support work of the martial law forces in the capital, more than half of the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who were injured during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, returning to their units.

During the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, over 5,000 soldiers and officers of the martial law forces were injured, with more than 2,000 hospitalized. Medical staff in the hospitals of the stationed troops treated and cared for the injured as if they were their own family members. Nearly a hundred veteran experts, professors, and retired medical personnel voluntarily participated in the rescue efforts. Many medical staff members washed the faces, bathed, fed, and washed the clothes of the injured soldiers, and also brought them eggs, fruits, and books. Medical staff from over 30 local hospitals in Beijing, including Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Friendship Hospital, Xuanwu Hospital, and Beijing Emergency Center, braved the obstruction and insults from the rioters, enduring humiliation to treat and transport over 600 injured soldiers. It is reported that under the meticulous care of the medical staff, the remaining injured soldiers will gradually be discharged and return to their units.

    戒严部队伤员多数出院
    新华社北京7月21日电  （通讯员罗晓斌）据日前召开的首都戒严部队后勤保障工作会议透露，在平息首都反革命暴乱中负伤住院的解放军官兵，目前已有半数以上痊愈出院，返回部队。
    在平息首都反革命暴乱中，戒严部队5000多名官兵被打伤，其中2000多人被收治住院。驻京部队各医院的医务人员视伤员如亲人，精心进行治疗和护理。近百名老专家、老教授和已经退休的医务人员也主动参加了抢救。许多医务人员为受伤官兵洗脸、擦澡、喂饭、洗衣服，还给伤员送去鸡蛋、水果和图书等。北京协和、友谊、宣武和北京急救中心等30多家地方医院的医务人员，不顾暴徒的堵截谩骂，忍辱负重，收治、接送部队伤员600多名。据悉，在医护人员的精心治疗和护理下，其余的受伤官兵将陆续出院返队。
