In China, a wave of enthusiasm for passenger car production is quietly rising. Companies that originally produced cargo trucks are now seeking to build new passenger car assembly lines. Those currently constructing or planning to construct high-end passenger cars are also considering adding low-end models or expanding their mid-range production capacity. New passenger car production bases are being proposed and added one after another. High, mid, and low-end models, travel SUVs, micro-cars, ultra-micro-cars... the variety of passenger car production lines is numerous. The planned annual production capacity ranges from 300,000, 150,000, to as low as 30,000 or 15,000 vehicles, totaling over a hundred million vehicles. Compared to the 25,000 vehicles (including imported kits) produced nationwide in 1988, this represents a several-fold increase...

The Wish is Good

Accelerating the development of domestically produced passenger cars and preparing for exports, while replacing imports, is a good wish and not a bad thing. Currently, out of the tens of thousands of passenger cars in China, 80% were imported after 1984. From 1981 to 1987, China imported 215,000 passenger cars, spending $1 billion. Considering the general lifespan of passenger cars, by the early 1990s, these cars will begin to enter their replacement phase. If we do not plan ahead for passenger car production to replace imports, it will be difficult to stop another wave of passenger car imports.

The passenger car industry is a technology and labor-intensive industry with a broad range of related fields and a long production chain. Actively developing China's passenger car industry will not only promote the development of related industries such as metallurgy, chemical, petroleum, building materials, light industry, textiles, machinery, and electronics but will also be beneficial for the corresponding development of highways, urban construction, and the tertiary industry.

At the same time, passenger car production involves a large number of components, with annual production in the tens of millions. It is based on product series and standardization, which can achieve the best economic benefits from economies of scale. Many developed countries therefore support it as a pillar industry of the national economy, and China's development of the national economy is no exception.

Insufficient Strength

The passenger car industry is a capital-intensive industry. It is reported that building a passenger car project with an annual production capacity of 300,000 vehicles requires an investment of about 40,000 yuan per vehicle. In the near future, if the production capacity for various types of passenger cars is increased by 1 million vehicles, the required investment will reach 40 to 50 billion yuan. This is obviously beyond China's current financial and material capabilities.

Developing the passenger car industry cannot be judged solely by the investment estimates of a few assembly line projects but requires a large amount of investment in many aspects. As the saying goes, "Without a developed parts industry, there is no complete passenger car industry." If we only focus on building assembly lines without considering the relatively independent and appropriately advanced parts industry projects, under such conditions lacking necessary foundations, even if the assembly lines are built, they will still have to rely on imported kits to operate.

From a material and technological perspective, the situation is also insufficient. Taking steel as an example, a typical passenger car requires over 600 types of steel, with each vehicle using about 1 ton. An additional 1 million passenger cars will require about 1 million tons of various types of steel. From a quantity perspective, the problem is not significant. The issue lies in the variety and quality meeting international standards, which is not easy to achieve. Items such as special steels, engineering plastics, rubber, paint, etc., involve both investment and technological development issues, which are not easy to resolve in the near future.

Can We Compare?

The reason for the "passenger car fever" is, subjectively, not only the exaggeration of the "driving effect" and "ripple effect" but also, importantly, the simple comparison of per capita passenger car ownership with other countries. In 1987, China's passenger car ownership was 450,000 vehicles, with an average of 0.45 vehicles per 1,000 people, while the average worldwide was 78 vehicles per 1,000 people. Many people felt the gap was too large and believed that we must catch up quickly.

However, China's fundamental national conditions are that we have a large population, with 80% living in rural areas, which is a major factor that cannot be compared with other countries. In 1987, with a population of 1 billion, the average passenger car ownership was 0.45 vehicles per 1,000 people; by 1989, with a population of 1.1 billion, the average passenger car ownership was only decreasing.

Some third-world countries with large populations, in their initial stages, increased their per capita passenger car ownership by 1 to 1.5 vehicles, often taking 10 to 20 years. According to historical data from the China International Engineering Consulting Corporation, India's per capita passenger car ownership increased from 0.66 to 1.68 vehicles (an increase of 1.02 vehicles) from 1960 to 1985, taking 25 years. Countries like Pakistan, Indonesia, and Nigeria also took 10 to 15 years to increase their per capita passenger car ownership to 2.6 vehicles. Even if China builds 1 million additional passenger cars as proposed by the "passenger car fever," by the end of the century, the passenger car ownership will only be around 6 million vehicles, with a population of 1.3 billion (possibly more), resulting in an average of only about 5 vehicles per 1,000 people. By then, the average worldwide passenger car ownership will not remain at 78 vehicles per 1,000 people. Therefore, we cannot simply compare the per capita passenger car ownership index with other countries.

Scientific Forecasting

In recent years, some domestic units have made various predictions about China's passenger car ownership by the end of the century, ranging from 2.5 million to 10 million vehicles, with a median of 5 million vehicles. The predictions vary greatly.

From 2.5 million to 10 million vehicles, why is the gap between the upper and lower limits so large? The main reason is the different views on the large-scale entry of passenger cars into households.

The China International Engineering Consulting Corporation, based on domestic and international data and repeated research and analysis, believes that the idea of "passenger cars entering households" in the near future is detached from China's national conditions and does not match the current reality. By the year 2000, the main flow of passenger cars in China will still be for official, business, tourism, and taxi group purchases, with only a small number entering households. Therefore, the passenger car ownership by the end of the century is expected to be between 2.5 million and 3 million vehicles, with an annual demand of 500,000 vehicles, which is more in line with China's national conditions. This is a significant leap compared to the current ownership of 450,000 vehicles and annual production of 25,000 vehicles.

Why is it said that China's "passenger cars entering households" is still premature?

Some comrades believe that international data shows that when per capita national income reaches $750 (1979 value), the demand for passenger cars increases rapidly, and by the year 2000, China's per capita national income will reach $800 to $1,000, making passenger cars ready to enter households in large numbers. This judgment is not entirely scientific. Apart from the $750 being set too low (it should generally be $1,000), it mainly ignores various important factors such as inflation and exchange rate changes.

In terms of passenger car prices, they usually increase by 4% to 8% per year. For example, a foreign ordinary passenger car was priced at $3,100 in 1979, but by 1988, it had risen to $6,000. It can be seen that by the end of the century, based on the current exchange rate, China's per capita national income will only reach 1/10 of the current international ordinary passenger car price, making it impossible for passenger cars to enter households in large numbers.

Looking at the actual purchasing power of Chinese households, passenger cars will not enter households in large numbers in the near future.

It is well known that before 1978, most urban and rural households in China could only afford durable consumer goods in the hundred-yuan range (including those below a thousand yuan), such as bicycles, watches, and sewing machines. Since 1979, reform and opening up have brought benefits to the masses, with household incomes increasing, and many families being able to afford durable consumer goods in the thousand-yuan range (including those below ten thousand yuan), such as color TVs, refrigerators, and composite furniture. This represents an increase of one order of magnitude in 30 years.

Passenger cars are durable consumer goods in the ten-thousand-yuan range (including those below a hundred thousand yuan), with each vehicle requiring about 200 yuan per month for maintenance. For most families, increasing their purchasing power by another order of magnitude will likely take a considerable amount of time. Moreover, for durable consumer goods in the ten-thousand-yuan range, the main items are housing and passenger cars. For Chinese households, the more urgent need is housing, not passenger cars.

There is one more point to note: if passenger cars cannot enter households in large numbers and remain for social group purchases, then the scale of passenger car production and construction being too large and the development speed being too fast will also be a heavy burden on the country. In 1988, the national passenger car purchase fee was 6.5 billion yuan. In the future, even if each passenger car is calculated at 50,000 yuan, the purchase fee for 1 million passenger cars will be 50 billion yuan. This will make the burden on the country and local governments increasingly heavy, not to mention the adverse effects on clean governance and the tradition of thrift and hard work in building the country.

    如何发展轿车业
    本报记者  鲁牧
    在我国，一股轿车生产“热”正在悄悄升起：原产载货汽车的，要求新建轿车生产线；正在建设中、高级轿车的，又想再上低档轿车，或者打算扩大中级轿车生产能力；拟议中的新布轿车生产厂点，在陆续增加。高中低档、旅行吉普、微型、超微型……各种轿车生产线，名目繁多。规划年生产能力大的30万、15万，小的3万、1.5万，合计起来不下百余万辆。这与1988年全国轿车产量（含进口散件组装）2.5万辆相比，将是数十倍地增长……
     愿望虽好
    加速国产轿车发展步伐，尽早实现“替代进口，准备出口”，愿望是好的，并非坏事。目前，在我国几十万辆轿车保有量中，80％是1984年后随着进口浪潮涌进来的。自1981年至1987年，全国进口轿车达21.5万辆，用汇10亿美元之多。按一般轿车使用寿命看，90年代初期将陆续进入更新期。如不及早筹划轿车生产，替代进口，那就难以阻遏轿车进口浪潮再度掀起。
    轿车工业是技术、劳动密集，关联面广，生产链条较长的综合性大生产行业。积极发展我国轿车工业，不仅对与之相关的冶金、化工、石油、建材、轻工、纺织、机械、电子等工业的发展将起促进作用，而且有利于公路、城市建设和第三产业的相应发展。
    同时，轿车生产零部件多，年产量以数十万计，是在产品系列化、通用化基础上进行的，最能从规模经济中取得最佳经济效益。许多经济发达国家因此将它作为国民经济的支柱产业予以扶持，我国发展国民经济亦不例外。
    力不从心
    轿车工业是投资密集型产业，有资料表明，建设1个年生产能力为30万辆的轿车项目，每辆轿车综合投资约需4万余元。近期内如果新增各类轿车100万辆生产能力，所需投资即达四五百亿元。这显然是我国目前财力物力很难承受的。
    发展轿车工业，还不能只看若干装配生产线项目的投资概算，而需要多方面的大量投资。有道是“没有发达的零部件工业，就没有完整的轿车工业。”如果只顾上组装生产线，不考虑它的相对独立、适度超前的零部件工业项目建设，在这种缺乏必要基础的情况下，要使装配生产线运转起来，也只得依赖进口散件过日子。
    从物质技术方面看，同样力不从心。以钢材为例，普通轿车需要600多个品种的钢材，每辆用量约需1吨。新增100万辆轿车，需要各种钢材100万吨左右。仅从数量看，问题不大。问题在于品种、质量达到国际标准谈何容易。诸如特殊钢材、工程塑料、橡胶、油漆等等，既有投资问题，又有技术开发问题，都是近期内不易办到的事。
    岂能攀比
    “轿车热”之所以产生，从主观上看，除了夸大“带动作用”、“波及效益”之外，很重要的一点是单纯以千人轿车保有量跟别的国家攀比。1987年，我国轿车保有量为45万辆，平均千人0.45辆，而世界各国平均千人保有量则达78辆。不少人由此感到差距太大，认为必须急起直追。
    但是，我国基本国情是，人口多，基数大，80％又在农村，这是与世界各国不可比的主要因素。1987年，以10亿人口为分母，千人轿车保有量只有0.45辆；而到1989年，分母变为11亿人口，千人轿车保有量却是只减不增了。
    一些第三世界人口众多的国家，在起步阶段，千人轿车保有量每增1辆，大多需要一二十年的时间。中国国际工程咨询公司提供的国际历史资料载，印度千人轿车保有量由0.66辆增至1.68辆，即增加1.02辆，是从1960年到1985年，时间长达25年之久。巴基斯坦、印度尼西亚、尼日利亚等国在千人轿车保有量达到2.6辆以前，每增加1至1.5辆，也用了10年到15年的时间。我国即使按“轿车热”出现的新增100万辆生产能力进行建设，到本世纪末轿车保有量也不过600万辆左右，而那时全国人口将达13亿（可能还多），平均千人保有量仅为5辆左右。到那时，世界各国平均千人保有量决不会停留在78辆水平上。所以不能单纯以千人保有量指数同别的国家攀比。
    科学预测
    近年来，国内一些有关单位对本世纪末我国轿车保有量，纷纷进行过预测。少者250万至350万辆，多者700万至1000万辆，居中则为500万辆，预测结果不一。
    从250万辆到1000万辆，上限与下限之间为什么差距如此之大？其原因，主要在于对轿车大量进入家庭持有不同观点。
    中国国际工程咨询公司根据国内外资料，经反复研究分析后认为，近期内“轿车进入家庭”的设想是脱离我国国情、不切合当前实际的。到2000年，国内轿车流向主要仍为公务、商务、旅游、出租等集团购买，只有少量进入家庭。因此，本世纪末轿车保有量为250万至300万辆、当年需求量为50万辆，较为符合我国国情。这与目前保有45万辆、年产2.5万辆相比，已是个相当大的飞跃。
    为什么说我国“轿车进入家庭”为时尚早呢？
    有些同志认为，国际资料表明当人均国民收入达到750美元（1979年币值）时，轿车需求量即迅速增长，而到2000年我国人均国民收入将达800至1000美元，轿车即可开始大量进入居民家庭。这种判断是不尽科学的。除750美元定得偏低（一般应为1000美元）之外，主要忽略了通货膨胀和汇率变化等多种重要因素。
    就轿车售价而言，通常每年上涨4％—8％。例如，国外一种普通型轿车，1979年每辆售价3100美元，1988年则已涨至6000美元。可见，到本世纪末，按当前汇率折算，我国人均国民收入只达到目前国际普通型轿车价格的1／10，轿车焉能大量进入居民家庭？
    再从我国居民家庭购买力实际水平来看，近期内轿车也不可能大量进入家庭。
    众所周知，1978年以前，我国城乡居民大部分家庭只能购买百元级（含千元以下）耐用消费品，如自行车、手表、缝纫机老三件。1979年以来，改革开放给广大居民带来实惠，家庭收入有了提高，不少家庭可购千元级（含万元以下）耐用消费品，如彩电、冰箱、组合家具新三件。30年上了个数量级。
    轿车属于万元级（含10万元以下）耐用消费品，每月每辆维修费用即需200元左右。多数家庭购买力水平再跳1个数量级，所需时间恐怕不会很短。况且，万元级耐用消费品主要是住房、轿车，对我国居民家庭的实际需求来说，更为迫切的是住房，而不是轿车。
    还有一点值得注意，那就是，既然轿车不能大量进入家庭，仍为社会集团购买，那末轿车生产建设规模过大，发展速度过猛，对国家也是个沉重负担。1988年，全国轿车购置费就达65亿元。今后，每辆轿车即使按5万元计算，百万辆轿车的购置费将达500亿元。这将会使国家和地方背负的包袱愈来愈重，更不消说对廉政建设、发扬勤俭建国艰苦奋斗的传统作风不利了。
