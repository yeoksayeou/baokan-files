	Observations from Three Hours on the Square
	People's Daily reporters Wú Héngquán and Gōng Jīnxīng

	This is an experience that the reporters personally went through during the turmoil. Today, perhaps it can provide some enlightenment for those who do not understand the truth.

	Only "foreigners" can go to the Monument to conduct interviews

	On May 23, we went to Tiananmen Square for a temporary interview.

	At 12:30 PM, an ambulance took us to the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes.

	The Monument to the People's Heroes is the command center of the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students." They set up several checkpoints around it. As soon as we approached the first checkpoint, we were stopped.

	A student-like person asked, "What are you doing?"

	We took out our press cards and handed them to him, "We are here to interview."

	He flipped through the press cards and told us, "We have a rule: domestic reporters are not allowed to interview freely on the Monument."

	After repeated explanations, he finally let us in around the Monument.

	The Monument was filled with garbage, emitting a sour smell.

	The northeast corner of the Monument seemed to be the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students'" printing point. Three oil printing machines were printing. Several students were engraving steel plates. The ground was littered with waste paper, empty ink cans, and ink stains. We tried to cross the checkpoint to see what they were printing, but we were stopped.

	The northwest corner of the Monument gathered many foreign journalists. Some were carrying cameras, and others had set up cameras. Several university students were talking to a foreign female journalist in a foreign language.

	Around 2 PM, three criminals who had defaced the portrait of Chairman Mao on the Tiananmen Gate were brought to the northeast corner of the Monument. Here, both domestic and foreign journalists rushed to interview this sudden event. Most domestic journalists were stopped outside the checkpoint, and only a few foreign journalists were allowed to record. One of our reporters saw this and became somewhat indignant, shouting at a young man in charge of the checkpoint, "For over a month, haven't you been asking for freedom? You say you want press freedom, but your actions are exactly press censorship. Why allow 'foreigners' to interview and not us?" The young man immediately said, "Don't shout, don't shout! Actually, I can't make decisions. I'll talk to them for you." He quickly went to the checkpoint entrance and discussed with two people who seemed to be in charge here. Then he told us, "Wait a moment to listen to the announcement to attend the press conference!"

	Letters with differing opinions are not broadcast

	We went to the Monument for a short while, and a student came up to ask us if we would like to see the letters to the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students" radio station. We thought this was an opportunity to understand the situation, so we followed the student to the southeast corner of the Monument.

	There was a small tent made of canvas. The person in charge of keeping the letters was a student named Chen from Jilin Industrial University. He took out two bulging large envelopes, one labeled "Broadcasted" and the other "Not Broadcasted." We looked at the letters while Chen stood by, repeatedly reminding us not to copy them.

	Most of the letters in the "Broadcasted" envelope advocated "not withdrawing from Tiananmen Square." They were mostly in the form of slogans, with some providing various types of "intelligence." These letters were mostly written on torn, uneven pieces of paper, and the handwriting was very messy.

	In contrast, the letters in the "Not Broadcasted" envelope were more cautious. These letters emphasized reasoning and hoped that the students would withdraw from the square immediately. We remembered three of them.

	The first letter was from a graduate student at Huazhong Normal University. The graduate student wrote that he had come to Beijing from Wuhan to investigate this "student movement." During this time, he surveyed the attitudes of residents in Beijing's streets and alleys and believed that most people did not understand the purpose and motives of this "student movement." Apart from watching the spectacle, they were already in a state of fatigue and even had feelings of annoyance. At the same time, the students' physical and mental endurance had become quite fragile. He sincerely hoped that the "organizers" would consider the long-term situation, care for the students, and withdraw from the square.

	The second letter was signed by several intellectuals with the title "Your teachers are also your students." These intellectuals spoke earnestly about the path they had taken over the past 40 years and discussed the attitudes and actions that should be taken to promote democratization and build democracy. They suggested withdrawing from the square immediately.

	The third letter was from several citizens of Beijing. These citizens bluntly criticized the "disaster" that the "student movement" had brought to them over the past month: they had to walk for several hours to get to work, supplies were tight, and even the opportunity to sleep well was disrupted.

	After reading the letters, we bluntly asked, "Why are these letters advocating withdrawal from the square not broadcasted?" The student named Chen did not hesitate to say, "These letters have too extreme views!"

	A student's understanding of "democracy"

	When we returned to the north side of the Monument to rest, an 18 or 19-year-old female student started chatting with us.

	We asked her, "You don't seem to be from Beijing, are you here to support?"

	She replied, "You guessed it."

	"Do you know the situation in Beijing before you came?"

	"Yes."

	"How did you know?"

	"The students who called us to support said that Beijing is conducting a democratic struggle and needs us to come to Beijing to strengthen the momentum, so we came."

	"So, you are here for democracy."

	"Yes."

	"Can you tell us what 'democracy' means to you?"

	"After graduation, if you are wronged at work, you can vent it out at work." She thought for a moment and said this to us.

	"You seem to have a low understanding of 'democracy.'"

	"In short, it's being able to do what you want to do, to do as you please." This time she spoke more directly.

	Around 3 PM, a sudden storm came, and we hurriedly ended our conversation with the female student.

	Before our conversation with the female student, we also interviewed several other students who came to Beijing to "support." One student said something interesting: "Why did you come to support? To be honest, coming to Beijing to play has been my long-held wish. Now the train is free, there is food to eat, and there is this romantic camping, how could I not come?"

    广场三小时见闻
    本报记者　吴恒权　龚金星
    这是动乱期间记者亲身经历的事。今天提起，或许能为不明真相的人提供一点启示。
    不是“老外”，不能上纪念碑采访
    5月23日，我们去天安门广场临时采访。
    12时30分。一辆救护车把我们送到人民英雄纪念碑北侧。
    人民英雄纪念碑，是“高自联”的指挥中心所在地。他们在周围设置了好几道纠察线。我们刚接近第一道纠察线，就被拦住了。
    一学生模样的人问：“干什么的？”
    我们掏出记者证递给他：“采访的。”
    他翻开记者证告诉我们：“我们有规定，纪念碑上不让国内记者随便采访。”
    经一再解释，他才放我们进入纪念碑周围。
    纪念碑上满是垃圾，散发着一股酸臭味。
    纪念碑的东北角像是“高自联”的印刷点。三部油印机正在开印。几名学生在刻钢板。这里，满地废纸、空油墨罐，还有斑斑墨迹。我们试图越过纠察线看看他们在印些什么，却被拦了回来。
    纪念碑的西北角聚了许多外国记者。他们有的扛着摄像机，有的架起照相机。有几位大学生正用外语跟一名外国女记者交谈。
    14时许，三名污损天安门城楼毛主席像的犯罪分子被扭到纪念碑东北角。在这里的中外记者纷纷涌上来争相采访这一突发性事件。国内记者大多被拦在纠察线外，只有一些外国记者获准进行录相。我们中的一名记者见状有些愤愤然，冲着一名负责纠察的小伙子嚷了起来：“一个多月来，你们不是在要自由吗？你们说是要新闻自由，然而，你们的做法恰恰是新闻封锁。为什么让‘老外’采访，不让我们采访？”那小伙子马上说：“别嚷，别嚷！其实我也不能作主，我帮你们说说吧。”他迅即走到纠察线入口处，和两名似是在这里负责的人商量了一下。然后告诉我们：“等一会听通知参加新闻发布会吧！”
    对持不同意见的来稿不播
    我们来到纪念碑不一会儿，一名学生上来问我们，是否愿意看看“高自联”广播站的来稿。我们觉得这是个了解情况的机会，便随这位学生到了纪念碑的东南角。
    这里有一个用帆布搭成的小棚。负责保管稿件的是吉林工业大学一位姓陈的学生。他拿出两个鼓鼓囊囊的大信封，一个上面写着“已播”，一个写着“不播”。我们看稿时，陈一步不离，并一再提醒我们不要抄录。
    在已播的稿件中，大部分是主张“不撤离天安门广场”的。以标语口号式的文章为多，有一些则是提供各类“情报”的。这些来稿大多用撕得残缺不齐的小纸片写成，字迹也很潦草。
    相形之下，那些“不播”的稿件就慎重多了。这些稿件着重讲道理，希望同学们马上撤离广场。我们印象较深的有三篇。
    第一篇是华中师范大学的一位研究生的来稿。这位研究生在稿中说，他是专程从武汉来北京考察这次“学运”的。这一段时间，他到北京的大街小巷调查了居民们的心态，认为大多数人对这次“学运”的目的和动机不理解，除了看热闹之外，他们已处于疲倦状态，甚至产生了厌烦情绪。同时，同学们的身体和心理承受能力已相当脆弱。他深切地希望“组织者”能作长远考虑，爱护同学们，撤离广场。
    第二篇是署名“你们的老师也是你们的学生”的几位知识分子的来信。这些知识分子语重心长地讲述了他们40年来所走过的路，又论述了为推进民主化进程、建设民主所应采取的态度，应做的事。他们建议迅速撤离广场。
    第三封信是北京市的几位市民写来的。这几位市民毫不客气地指责一个多月来“学潮”带给他们的“灾难”：上班要步行好几个小时，供应紧张，连睡个好觉的机会都给搅没了。
    看完稿件，我们直言不讳地问：“这些主张撤离广场的来稿为何不播？”那位姓陈的同学不假思索地说：“这些稿件的观点太偏激了！”
    一名“声援”的学生对民主的理解
    当我们回到纪念碑北侧休息时，一位约十八九岁的女学生同我们聊开了。
    我们问她：“看样子，你不是北京人，来声援的吧？”
    她答：“你猜对了。”
    “你来之前，知不知道北京的情况？”
    “知道。”
    “怎么知道的？”
    “号召我们来声援的同学说，北京在进行一场民主斗争，需要我们进京壮大声势，我们就跟来了。”
    “那么，你是为民主而来的。”
      “不错。”
    “能不能告诉我们，你心中的‘民主’含义是什么。”
    “将来毕业以后，在单位受了气可在单位发泄出来。”她略微想了想，这样对我们说。
    “你这样理解‘民主’看来是低了一点。”
    “说到底就是能干自己想干的事，为所欲为呗。”她这回说得干脆多了。
    15时许，一场狂风暴雨来临，我们匆匆结束了同那位女学生的对话。
    在同那位女学生对话前，我们还采访了另几名来京“声援”的学生。有一名学生说得很有意思：“你问我为什么来声援？实话说吧，到北京来玩玩是我多年的愿望，如今坐车不要钱，饭有得吃，还有这浪漫的露营，怎么能不来？”
