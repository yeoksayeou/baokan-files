    Seriously Accepting Media Criticism
    Cangnan Cracks Down on Counterfeit and Fraudulent Activities

    According to a report from our newspaper, the Cangnan County Committee and the County People's Government of Zhejiang Province have humbly accepted criticism from media outlets. They have faced the issues head-on and are determined to redeem their reputation. Starting from May 18, the county has launched a special campaign to crack down on counterfeit and fraudulent activities, achieving initial success.

    Cangnan County is responsible for approximately 80% of the country's signboard and trademark production and business. However, during the production process, some counterfeit and fraudulent activities have emerged. On May 8, newspapers such as the People's Daily and Market News published an exposé titled "Cangnan Becomes the Counterfeit Trademark Village," with Market News also publishing an editorial titled "Trouble Starts in Cangnan, What Will Cangnan Do?" The media's criticism has caused a significant stir in Cangnan County. The Cangnan County Committee and the County People's Government believe that the media's criticism is well-intentioned. If they do not crack down on the activities of a few individuals who produce and sell counterfeit trademarks and send bribery advertisements, it will not only damage the reputation of Cangnan County's signboard and trademark manufacturing industry but also harm Cangnan's image and even destroy its economic development. Therefore, they have made a resolute decision to launch a special campaign to crack down on counterfeit and fraudulent activities.

    So far, the county has inspected 901 enterprises and individual businesses, uncovering 71 cases of illegal activities, including 30 major cases. They have seized 1,030 meters of counterfeit clothing trademarks and 9.08 million other trademark labels. Additionally, they have taken serious action against six cases, including Jinxiang Science and Education Arts Factory sending bulk orders for "Party Member's Handbook" and Jiangnan Arts Factory printing 1989 National College Entrance Examination Political Science prediction questions.

    认真接受新闻媒介批评
    苍南打击假冒骗活动
    本报讯　浙江省苍南县委、县人民政府虚心接受新闻单位的批评，正视问题，发愤雪耻，从5月18日开始，在全县开展打击假冒骗违法活动专项斗争，已取得初步成效。
  苍南县的标牌、商标承接和生产业务量约占全国80％。在商标生产过程中，出现了一些假冒骗违法活动。5月8日，《人民日报》、《市场报》等报刊，以《苍南成了假商标之乡》为题作了披露，《市场报》还配发了《祸起苍南，苍南怎么办？》的社论。新闻单位的批评，在苍南县引起了很大的震动。苍南县委、县人民政府认为，新闻单位的批评是十分善意的，如果不把少数人制售假冒商标和发寄行贿广告等假冒骗违法活动打下去，不仅败坏了苍南县标牌、商标制作业的声誉，损害了苍南的形象，而且破坏甚至会毁灭苍南的经济发展。于是，下了发愤雪耻的决心，部署开展打击假冒骗违法活动的专项斗争。
    到目前为止，全县已对901家企业和个体户进行了检查，共查出违法案件71件，其中大案30件，查获假冒服装商标1030米，其他商标标识908万张。此外，还对金乡科教工艺厂发寄通函征订《党员手册》、江南工艺厂乱印1989年高考政治科预测题等6个案件作出了严肃处理。
