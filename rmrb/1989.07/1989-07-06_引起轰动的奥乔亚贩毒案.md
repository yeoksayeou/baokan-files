The past half-month has seen the Cuban government's investigation into high-ranking military officials, led by General Ochoa, involvement in international drug trafficking become a major news story in the Western Hemisphere. This case is the largest to occur within the military since the Cuban Revolution's victory and is closely linked to the sensitive issue of international drug trafficking in the United States and Latin American countries. Therefore, not only are ordinary Cubans shocked, but the international community is also stirred.

Ochoa is a well-known figure both domestically and internationally. As a close comrade of Castro, he fought as a guerrilla in the Sierra Maestra. During the Angolan war, he served as the second-in-command of the Cuban forces. Due to his "merits," he is ranked fourth among Cuba's five "Heroes of the Republic." Before the incident, he was about to be transferred to the command of the most powerful Western 2nd Army. Such a "successful" general, however, could not resist the temptation of money and fell into the abyss of corruption, smuggling, and drug trafficking.

On June 12, Ochoa and his aide Martinez were suddenly arrested. Subsequently, several high-ranking military officers from the Ministry of the Interior were also imprisoned. Ochoa has confessed to his criminal activities. On June 22, the official newspaper of the Cuban Central Committee, *Granma*, published a detailed editorial exposing the facts of Ochoa and others' involvement in international drug trafficking. According to reports, in 1986, while Ochoa was in charge of liaison with foreign armies in the Ministry of Armed Forces, his aide, Colonel Martinez, informed him that an Italian-American suggested he participate in the "money laundering" activities of a drug trafficking group. "Money laundering" refers to converting illegal income into legal income through certain means, an important link in drug trafficking activities. Ochoa agreed, but since they did not understand "money laundering," the matter was dropped. Later, at Ochoa's behest, Martinez became acquainted with a Colombian named Barreha. Barreha told Martinez that his boss was the leader of Colombia's largest drug trafficking group, Pablo Escobar, and suggested that Martinez obtain a fake passport to meet with Escobar in Colombia. When Ochoa learned that Colonel Toni La Guardia of the Ministry of the Interior's MC Bureau was also in contact with Escobar's subordinates, he dispatched Martinez to make contact with Toni, thus beginning the collaboration between these two different military groups in drug trafficking. With the help of Toni and others, Martinez entered Colombia with a fake passport in May of that year to meet with Escobar. Escobar proposed that if they helped transport drugs to the United States, they could receive $1200 per kilogram of cocaine. They also discussed methods to smuggle drugs into the United States. Unfortunately, the first drug transport failed because the ship's captain was killed. The Cuban authorities believe that Martinez's trip to Colombia was the most serious part of their criminal activities. As an active-duty officer and an aide to a famous general, if he were caught by Colombian authorities, it would bring irreparable shame to Cuba. In fact, according to Martinez's confession, he often mentioned his "superior" to Escobar. Based on this, Escobar could easily misunderstand "superior" as a high-ranking Cuban leader.

Toni was in charge of the MC Bureau in the Ministry of the Interior. The MC Bureau is a secret foreign trade department established by Cuba to break the U.S. economic blockade, with the authority to coordinate with the National Defense Forces and the Air Force. It was by using these powers that Toni and his subordinates were able to secretly carry out drug trafficking. On the one hand, they cooperated with Ochoa, and on the other hand, they independently connected with Colombian drug traffickers, repeatedly succeeding. According to the current situation known to the Cuban authorities, by April of this year, Toni's group had carried out 19 transportation activities. Four failed, and 15 succeeded. It is estimated that the amount of cocaine smuggled into the United States alone reached 6 tons. The Cuban authorities seized hundreds of thousands of dollars in illicit funds from Toni and others. In late April, Toni handed over $50,000 to Ochoa, who then had Martinez deposit this money in the safe of a Cuban official in Panama.

It is believed that Cuba's exposure of Ochoa and others' drug trafficking problem is aimed at a certain international background. In recent years, the United States has repeatedly accused Cuban and Panamanian military personnel of jointly engaging in international drug trafficking, and the accusations were quite specific. On the other hand, Colombian drug trafficking groups also claimed to have cooperated with the Cuban military. This has damaged Cuba's international reputation. Cuba's resolute exposure of Ochoa and others seems to be a statement to the international community that Cuba will not tolerate such dirty deals. U.S. newspapers even believe that this is a gesture by Cuba to the United States, indicating that Cuba can cooperate with the United States on the issue of opposing drugs.

    引起轰动的奥乔亚贩毒案
    本报记者　朱满庭
    半个月来，古巴政府追查以奥乔亚将军为首的一些高级将领参与国际贩毒活动一事，成了西半球的大新闻。这一案件是古巴革命胜利后发生在军内的最大案件，案情又与美国和拉美国家敏感的国际贩毒相关，因此，不仅古巴老百姓十分震惊，国际社会也为之轰动。
    奥乔亚是古巴国内外知名度很高的将领。作为卡斯特罗的亲密战友，在马埃斯特拉山打过游击。在安哥拉战争中，任古巴驻军的第二号司令。因有“战功”，在古巴5名“共和国英雄”中，排列第4。案发前，他即将调任古巴军力最强大的西部第2军司令。这样一个“功成名就”的将军却没有抵挡住金钱的诱惑，堕落成一名贪污、走私、贩毒的罪犯。
    6月12日，奥乔亚和他的助手马丁内斯突然被捕。接着，内务部的几个高级军官也锒铛入狱。奥乔亚对自己的犯罪活动已经供认不讳。6月22日，古巴中央机关报《格拉玛》报以社论形式，详尽地披露了奥乔亚等人参与国际贩毒的事实。据报道，1986年，奥乔亚在武装部队部担任负责与外军联络的领导工作时，他的助手马丁内斯上校告诉他，一个美籍意大利人建议他参加贩毒集团的“洗钱”活动。所谓“洗钱”，就是把非法收入通过某种方式变成合法收入，是贩毒活动中的一个重要环节。奥乔亚欣然同意，但由于他们不懂“洗钱”，此事也就作罢。后来，在奥乔亚的授意下，马丁内斯结识了哥伦比亚人巴雷哈，巴雷哈告诉马丁内斯，他的头头是哥伦比亚最大贩毒集团的首领巴勃罗·埃斯科巴尔，并建议马丁内斯搞一份假护照，到哥伦比亚与埃斯科巴尔会晤。当奥乔亚打听到内务部MC局的托尼·拉·瓜迪亚上校也和哥伦比亚埃斯科巴尔的手下有接触，便派马丁内斯与托尼接头，从此，这两伙不同系统的军人开始合作从事贩毒活动。在托尼等人的帮助下，马丁内斯于同年5月持假照进入哥伦比亚与埃斯科巴尔见面。埃斯科巴尔提出，如果他们帮助向美国转运毒品，每公斤可卡因可给1200美元的酬金。他们还商议好将毒品偷运进美国的办法。没想到第一次毒品转运，因运毒船船长被人杀死而未能实现。古巴当局认为，马丁内斯的哥伦比亚之行，是他们犯罪活动最为严重的情节之一。因为，作为现役军官，又是一位著名将领的助手，如果被哥伦比亚破获抓到，就会给古巴带来难以洗刷的污辱。事实上，据马丁内斯交待，他对埃斯科巴尔每每谈到他的“首长”。据此，埃斯科巴尔完全可以将“首长”理解为古巴高层领导。
    托尼在内务部主管MC局的工作。MC局是古巴为打破美国的经济封锁设立的一个秘密外贸部门，有权与国土防卫部队和航空部门协调工作。正是利用这些职权，托尼和他手下的几个人得以秘密地进行毒品转运。他们一方面与奥乔亚合作，一方面又单独与哥伦比亚毒贩挂钩，接连得手。据古巴当局现在掌握的情况，截至今年4月，托尼一伙共搞了19次转运活动。其中4次失败，15次成功。估计运进美国的毒品，光可卡因就达6吨。古巴当局从托尼等人家中查出上百万美元赃款。托尼在4月底曾将5万美元交给奥乔亚，奥乔亚则把这笔钱通过马丁内斯存放到古巴驻巴拿马的一位官员的保险柜中。
    据认为，古巴这次揭露奥乔亚等人的贩毒问题是针对某种国际背景的。近年来，美国不断指责古巴和巴拿马军人合伙从事国际贩毒，而且说得相当具体。另一方面，哥伦比亚贩毒集团也声称与古巴军方有过合作。这使古巴的国际声誉受到损害。古巴这次坚决揭露奥乔亚等人似在向国际社会表明，古巴是绝不允许从事这种肮脏交易的。美国报刊甚至认为，这是古巴对美国的一个姿态，表明古巴在反对毒品问题上可以与美国进行合作。
