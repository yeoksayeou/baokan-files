The collection of grain for state reserves is currently one of the most challenging issues in rural work. Due to the difficulties in grain procurement, some counties and townships adopted the policy of "cash in lieu of grain" in 1988, where exchanging 4 to 6 jiao (4 to 6 tenths of a yuan) could substitute for 1 kilogram of paddy rice to fulfill the grain procurement quota. This practice has many drawbacks and will bring adverse effects to rural work, and should be discontinued. Some of the drawbacks are as follows:

First, it fails to reflect the actual completion of the state's grain procurement quota. According to the reported data, a certain county and township have completed their procurement quotas, but the actual grain reserves in the state granaries do not match these figures. This makes it difficult to accurately reflect the actual quantity of grain procurement, affecting the state's correct arrangements based on the grain budget.

Second, it weakens the farmers' awareness of fulfilling grain procurement contracts. Every year, before the grain is collected, relevant departments at the township and village levels sign grain procurement contracts with the farmers. The contracts stipulate the delivery of grain, without any additional conditions for paying money in lieu of grain. The practice of "cash in lieu of grain" undermines the seriousness of the contracts and reduces the authority of the relevant departments in the eyes of the people. At the same time, the people may ignore the established contracts, making it difficult to sign grain procurement contracts in the future.

Third, it leads to farmers being unwilling or less willing to grow grain. Due to the low returns from farming, some farmers currently lack the motivation to produce grain. The option of paying money in lieu of grain encourages some farmers to seek work outside or focus on more profitable sideline businesses, leading to more severe land abandonment in some areas and making the work of grassroots cadres in rural areas even more difficult.

Fourth, it increases the difficulty of completing future grain procurement quotas. After some farmers complete their grain procurement contracts by paying money in lieu of grain, they sell the grain at the market. In this way, farmers here can earn an additional 3 to 4 jiao for every kilogram of paddy rice sold. If this continues, the state granaries will have less grain, and a large amount of grain will flow into the market, making it difficult to complete the grain procurement quotas.

In my opinion, encouraging farmers to deliver grain should rely on policies and the meticulous ideological and political work of grassroots cadres in rural areas, rather than relying on the expedient measure of "cash in lieu of grain."

### “以钱抵粮”弊端多

    “以钱抵粮”弊端多
    江苏常州市　吴学宪　周严山　徐建平
    粮食入库是目前农村工作中最让人头痛的问题。由于征粮难，有的县乡1988年采取以钱抵粮的政策，即少交1公斤稻谷，便交4至6角钱，以抵作粮食订购任务。以钱抵粮的做法弊端太多，将给农村工作带来不良后果，应该停止执行。略举其弊如下：
    一、不能反映国家粮食订购任务的完成情况。以上报数据来看，某县某乡的订购任务是完成了，但与国家粮库里实有粮食数不相吻合，难以反映国家粮食实物量的收购情况，影响国家根据粮食预算作出的正确安排。
    二、淡化农民完成粮食订购合同的观念。每年粮食入库之前，乡村有关部门都与农民签订粮食订购合同。合同规定交粮，并没有交钱抵粮的附加条件。以钱抵粮的做法使合同失去严肃性，降低了有关部门在群众中的威信。同时，群众会无视订立的合同，为今后订立粮食合同带来困难。
    三、造成农民不愿种粮或少种粮。由于种田效益低，现在一些农民没有生产粮食积极性。钱可抵粮，就使得一些农民纷纷外出做工赚钱，或把主要精力放在收入较高的副业上，导致有些地区土地抛荒更加严重，农村基层干部的工作更难开展。
    四、增加今后粮食订购任务完成的难度。一些农民以钱抵粮完成粮食订购合同后，便把粮食拿到集市上出售。这样，我们这里的农民出售1公斤稻谷，可多收入三四角钱。照此下去，国家粮库粮食减少，大量粮食流入集市，粮食订购任务怎能完成？
    我认为，鼓励农民交粮，要靠政策，靠农村基层干部深入细致的思想政治工作，不能靠以钱抵粮这种权宜之计。
