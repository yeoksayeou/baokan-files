Disabled people often become objects of pity and frequently live under the gaze of others, but such attention often hurts their self-respect.

American film and television actor Alan Toel lost a leg and has to use crutches to walk. He said that disabled people are often looked at strangely in society, and a large part of the reason is that films and television have distorted the correct image of disabled people as members of society. In films or on television, the roles played by disabled people are either villains or pitiful figures, or they are people with special abilities.

Toel said, "Why can't disabled people be recognized as being the same as ordinary people, capable of contributing to society?" In fact, some people with physical disabilities can become excellent bankers or workers. He said that the discrimination against disabled people in the film and television industry greatly influences society's attitude towards disabled people.

According to a survey by the U.S. Census Bureau, there are approximately 37 million people with physical disabilities in the United States. Toel calls on the film and television industry and other media to reflect the correct image of disabled people.

    残疾人的正确形象
    残疾人往往成为被怜悯的对象，经常在人们注视下生活，而这种注视却不免伤害了他们的自尊心。
    美国电影和电视演员阿兰·托艾失去一条腿，必须撑着双拐才能走路。他说残疾人在社会上被投以异样眼光，很大一部分原因是电影和电视歪曲了残疾人作为社会一分子的正确形象。在电影或电视中，残疾人扮演的角色不是恶徒便是可怜虫，或者是具有特异功能的人。
    托艾说为什么残疾人不能被承认同普通人一样，可以为社会作出贡献呢？实际上有某些身体缺陷的人完全可以成为优秀的银行家或工人。他说影视界对残疾人的歧视极大地影响着社会对残疾人的态度。
    据美国人口统计局调查，美国现约有3700万身体功能残疾者。托艾呼吁影视界和其他传播媒介反映残疾人的正确形象。
