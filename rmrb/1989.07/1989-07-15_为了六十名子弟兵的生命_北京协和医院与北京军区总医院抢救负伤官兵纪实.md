For the Lives of Sixty Soldiers
— A Record of Beijing Union Hospital and Beijing Military Region General Hospital's Rescue of Injured Soldiers

	(1)
At 22:20 on the night of June 3, 1989, a urgent phone call rang in the Beijing Union Hospital's main duty room. "I am from the Dongcheng District Committee. There are dozens of PLA soldiers injured while carrying out martial law duties at the south entrance of Wangfujing. Please send someone immediately." The voice on the other end of the line was anxious and urgent.

Deputy Director Lang Jinghe responded without hesitation: "We will leave immediately." He hung up the phone and immediately called for the medical department doctor Jiang Yan. The medical staff, dressed in white, rushed to Wangfujing South Entrance with Dr. Jiang. They walked east along the street, asking around, and finally found more than 30 injured soldiers inside a large iron gate. Just then, the emergency rescue car arrived. The rescue team immediately divided the injured into three groups and transferred them to the hospital.

The chief surgeon of the general surgery department, Yang Yong, and several doctors were already standing at the entrance of the emergency room waiting. As soon as the patients arrived, they immediately began emergency treatment. To save time, the doctors made special marks on the prescriptions for the injured soldiers.

By 1:00 AM, a crowd had gathered at the entrance of Beijing Union Hospital. The dense crowd pushed and shoved, trying to rush into the emergency room. A few thugs took advantage of the chaos and sneaked into the rehabilitation room. After receiving a sedative, soldier Xiaosong was in a deep sleep. A young man with long hair ran over, straddled Xiaosong, and smashed a glass bottle onto his head. At this critical moment, the principal of the nursing school, Jin Qiao, immediately stood up and blocked the thug's hands with her body. This woman in her fifties fearlessly shouted, "Stop! You can't hit the injured!" Facing the brutal thugs, the doctors and nurses in the rehabilitation room bravely stepped forward, using their bodies to form a human wall to protect the injured soldiers.

The thugs retreated from the rehabilitation room, but the injured soldiers were still in danger of being attacked again. They had to be moved immediately. The hospital entrance was blocked, and the ambulance could not leave; the general ward lacked confidentiality and could easily leak information. What to do? Vice Professor Jin Zimeng of the Endocrinology Department quickly thought of the Endocrinology Function Laboratory. This laboratory was at the innermost part of the underground passage, quiet and hidden, making it a good hiding place. He quickly led the way and took 29 injured soldiers to the laboratory.

Xiaosong was still in a deep sleep in the rehabilitation room, and now he was the only one left to be moved. At this moment, six or seven people of unknown identity rushed in, shouting, "Where are the injured soldiers?" Several pairs of fierce eyes stared at Principal Jin. "They have already been transferred to another hospital!" Principal Jin calmly replied. This group of people left grudgingly. Principal Jin immediately pushed a stretcher with the secretary of the Party branch of the Otolaryngology Department, Fang Wenjin, and moved Xiaosong onto it. They covered Xiaosong with a white sheet and, after several turns, hid him in a fire equipment storage room in the East Wing.

The chief of the instrument maintenance room, Wu Xiangju, hurriedly walked through the corridor and suddenly discovered a soldier with a swollen face curled up in the corner of the pediatric department. Wu immediately helped the soldier up and walked towards the office. Later, he found clothes, shoes, and socks for the injured soldier to change into and immediately called the soldier's contact in Beijing. At around 9:00 AM, Wu sent the soldier to Shuifu Garden Alley and personally handed him over to the person who came to pick him up.

The police officers from the hospital's public security bureau discovered 8 scattered soldiers in the rear garden and the isotope room during their patrol of the courtyard. They immediately found white coats, shoes, and hats for 5 lightly injured soldiers to wear and sent them to three intersections at Dongdan and Coal Ash Alley to guide them back to their barracks. Then, they escorted the remaining three soldiers with head injuries to the fire equipment storage room in the East Wing.

Of the 60 injured soldiers who were admitted first, excluding those transferred to military hospitals and those returned to their units, there were still 34 who had not been moved. The Party Committee of Beijing Union Hospital felt that the most responsible way was to quickly send the injured soldiers to the military hospital.

The task of contacting the military hospital fell to Yang Rongya, a female military doctor and a master's student from Beijing Military Region General Hospital who was studying at Beijing Union Hospital.

A urgent phone call rang in the duty room of the Medical Department of Beijing Military Region General Hospital. This was Yang Rongya calling. The director of the Science and Technology Training Department, Lin Xuelan, picked up the phone. "Beijing Union Hospital has 34 injured soldiers. If they are not moved today, their lives will be in danger if exposed tomorrow!"

Director Lin immediately reported to the duty commander and the leaders of the Medical Department and replied, "The hospital has two ambulances, one burned and one damaged, and the drivers and medical staff were injured, but don't worry, we will immediately send people to pick them up."

Yang Rongya, along with Director Bao of the Security Department, Wang, and Ren of Beijing Union Hospital, carefully studied the plan for going out. They selected the platoon leader Liu Kuitang, who had a concealed injury, and another soldier with long hair to change into civilian clothes and cleverly took the two injured soldiers out of the gate. They got into a car driven by a local driver at the gate. This driver, whose name is unknown, took the injured soldiers all the way to Beijing Military Region General Hospital.

The leaders of Beijing Military Region General Hospital, who had not slept for a day and night, were anxiously planning the transfer of the 34 injured soldiers from Beijing Union Hospital. The Party Committee dispatched Assistant Zhang Xingyi of the Medical Department and Assistant Liu Guizhen of the Inpatient Department to carry out the task of receiving the injured soldiers. Zhang and Liu risked their lives and brought back 6 lightly injured soldiers who had been disguised for the first time on foot. Then, they brought back 6 more injured soldiers in batches using bicycles.

To take away the seriously injured soldiers still in Beijing Union Hospital, they urgently needed to use cars with local license plates. The director of the Medical Department of Beijing Military Region General Hospital, Shi Fengchi, and the deputy director, Yang Guixue, thought of the children of their unit who drove in the local area. The deputy director of the outpatient department, Zhao Hongkui, and the chief nurse of the ophthalmology department, Zhou Juan, immediately mobilized their sons to drive. Worker Du Hong heard that the injured soldiers needed shirts for disguise and donated all her old shirts and two new shirts. Zhao Dongxun, Zhu Jiajun, and Xiao Du drove three cars to Beijing Union Hospital. Seeing that the shirts were still not enough, they took off their own shirts, bare-chested, and took all the injured soldiers back.

As soon as the last batch of 20 seriously injured soldiers arrived at Beijing Military Region General Hospital, the hospital director Chen Changlin and the political commissar Xu Jianlin immediately directed the rescue efforts, mobilizing personnel to support the emergency room. Deputy Director Lü Ziming checked the condition and treatment of each injured soldier; several old directors performed emergency surgery on a soldier with a head injury throughout the night; the head nurses of several departments personally pushed the injured soldiers to the emergency room and operating room; and the logistics department promptly provided hot meals for the injured soldiers who could eat.

By June 6, all 34 injured soldiers were out of danger, and some had returned to their posts.

Recently, these dozens of injured soldiers jointly wrote a letter to the State Council, the martial law command, and the Beijing Military Region Party Committee, sincerely thanking Beijing Union Hospital and Beijing Military Region General Hospital. They told the people around them with tears in their eyes that the medical staff of Beijing Union Hospital and the comrades of Beijing Military Region General Hospital had given them a second life.

    为了六十名子弟兵的生命
    ——北京协和医院与北京军区总医院抢救负伤官兵纪实

                        （一）
    1989年6月3日夜晚22点20分，一阵急促的电话铃声回响在北京协和医院总值班室。“我是东城区委，有数十名执行戒严任务的解放军官兵在王府井南口受伤，请你们马上来人。”耳机里传来急切焦虑的声音。
    副院长郎景和毫不犹豫地回答：“我们马上出发。”他放下电话，立即呼叫医务处医生蒋延。身着白衣召之即来的救护人员跟随蒋医生直奔王府井南口。他们沿着街口向东走，边走边打听，终于在一个大铁门内找到30多名伤员。恰巧这时，急救站的救护车赶到了，救护队队员立刻把伤员分成三批，分别转送医院。
    外科总值班医生杨勇和几位医生早已站立在急诊室门口等候。病员一到，他们马上展开了紧急救治。为了争取时间，对于解放军伤员，医生在处方上做了特殊标记。
                                  （二）
    凌晨一点多钟，协和医院门口围聚了不少人。黑压压的人群前推后拥，要冲急诊室。有几名暴徒趁着混乱钻进体疗室。伤员小宋打完镇静剂后正在酣睡，一个长头发的青年跑过来双腿跨在小宋身上，举起玻璃瓶子便向他脑袋上砸。在这千钧一发的时刻，护校校长金乔立刻站起，用身体挡住了暴徒的双手。这位年过5旬的女同志毫无畏惧地喝道：“住手！不能打伤员！”面对凶残的暴徒，体疗室医生护士不顾个人安危一个个挺身而出，他们用人墙隔开伤员，保护了受伤的官兵。
    暴徒退出了体疗室，伤员随时有再受冲击的危险，必须立即转移。医院门口被围，救护车不能外送；普通病房保密性差，容易走漏风声。怎么办？内分泌科金自孟副教授急中生智，想到了内分泌功能实验室。这个实验室在地下通道的最里面，安静隐蔽，是一个良好的藏身之处。他连忙带路，把29名伤员领到实验室。
    伤员小宋还在体疗室昏昏入睡，现在只剩下他一人未转移。这时候，六七个不明身份的人又叫叫嚷嚷地冲进来，“伤兵在哪里？”几双凶狠的目光盯着金校长。“早就转院了！”金校长沉着地回答。这群人悻悻地走开了。金校长马上和五官科总支书记方文钧推来一辆平车，把小宋抬上去，又用白床单将小宋罩住，左绕右转，推进东院的一间消防器材仓库隐藏起来。
    仪器维修室主任吴湘炬急匆匆穿过走廊时，突然发现小儿科的角落中有一名脸被打肿的战士蜷卧在地上。吴主任立即搀扶起战士向办公室走去。随后，他又找来衣服、鞋袜让伤员换上，并立即用电话通知了战士在北京的联络处。早上9点多钟，吴主任把战士送到帅府园胡同，亲手交给前来迎接的人。
    医院派出所的民警在巡视大院的时候，在后花园和同位素室先后发现了8名被冲散的战士，他们立即找来白大褂、鞋帽给5名轻伤员穿上，分别送到东单3条路口和煤渣胡同路口，指引他们回到部队集住地。接着，把剩下三名头部有伤的战士搀扶到东院的消防器材仓库中。
                                  （三）
    先入院的60名伤员，除了转送部队医院的，送归所在部队的，尚有34名暂时没有转移。协和医院党委感到最负责的办法是尽快把伤员送到部队医院。
    和部队医院联络的任务，落到北京军区总医院在协和进修的硕士研究生、女军医杨蓉娅身上。
    一阵急促的电话铃声在北京军区总医院医务部值班室响起，这是杨蓉娅打来的。科技训练科科长蔺学兰抓起电话。“协和医院有34名部队伤员，今天再不转移走，明天暴露了伤员就有生命危险！”
    蔺科长马上向值班首长和医务部领导请示，立刻回话：“医院两辆救护车一辆被烧毁，一辆被砸坏，司机和医护人员被打伤，但你们放心，我们马上派人去接。”
    杨蓉娅和协和医院保卫处牛处长、王干事、任干事详细研究了外出方案，挑选了伤情易遮掩的连长刘奎堂和另一个头发长的战士，换上便服巧妙地将两名伤员带出了大门，在大门口上了一位地方司机开的车，这位不知姓名的司机一直把伤员送到北京军区总医院。
                      （四）
    一昼夜未合眼的北京军区总医院领导为协和的34名伤员的转移问题紧张地谋划。党委选派医务部助理员张兴义、住院处助理员刘桂珍执行接收伤员的任务。张、刘二人冒着生命危险，第一次将6名经过化装的轻伤员徒步带了回来，然后又分批用自行车将6名伤员带回军区总院。
    为了把留在协和医院的重伤员接走，他们急需动用挂地方牌照的汽车。北京军区总医院医务部主任施风池、副主任杨贵学想到了本单位在地方开车的子弟。门诊部副主任赵洪奎、眼科主管护师周娟马上动员儿子，让他们出车。职工杜红听说伤员化装需要衬衣，把所有的旧衬衣和两件新衬衣一起献了出来。赵东筠、朱嘉俊、小杜开着三辆车到达协和医院后，看到衬衣还不够用，便把自己的衬衣脱下来，光着膀子把伤员全部拉了回来。
                                （五）
    最后一批20名重伤员一到北京军区总医院，院长陈长林，政委徐建林，立即指挥抢救，调集人员支援急诊室。副院长吕子明逐个检查伤员的伤情和治疗处理情况；几位老主任为一名颅脑外伤的伤员连夜手术；一些科室的护士长亲自推车到急诊室、手术室抢伤员；后勤部门及时给能用饭的伤员送来了热腾腾的饭菜。
    6月6日，34名伤员全脱离了危险，有的回到了战斗岗位。
    最近，这几十名伤员联名向国务院、戒严部队指挥部、北京军区党委写信，由衷地感谢协和医院、北京军区总医院。他们含泪告诉周围的人们，协和医院的医务工作者和北京军区总医院的战友给了他们第二次生命。
