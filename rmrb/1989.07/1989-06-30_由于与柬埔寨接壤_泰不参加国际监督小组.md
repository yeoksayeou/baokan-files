	Due to bordering Cambodia,
	Thailand Will Not Join the International Supervisory Group

	People's Daily, Bangkok, June 28th - Correspondent Liu Aicheng reports: Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila hopes that the international conference on the Cambodian issue to be held in Paris in August will produce an international supervisory body to verify the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia. However, he ruled out the possibility of Thailand participating in this body.

	Siddhi made the above remarks during an exclusive interview with the Bangkok Post yesterday.

	He said, "The reason I think Thailand should not play a role in this body is that we share a border with Cambodia. The international supervisory body will also carry out tasks along the Thai-Cambodian border. In this situation, if we participate in the international supervisory body, it will make us very awkward."

	Siddhi said, "On the issue of Thailand participating in the international supervisory body, my attitude is the same as the stance already taken by the military. As a neighboring country of Cambodia, we are in the position of the accused in this matter, so we do not want to have any relationship with this supervisory body." However, he said that Thailand could act as an observer.

	He also said that some ASEAN countries might participate in the international supervisory body.

	When discussing the future government of Cambodia and its seat in the United Nations, Siddhi pointed out, "The key is for the four parties to share power. A joint temporary government is necessary. Excluding any party will undermine peace talks. ASEAN advocates the participation of the Khmer Rouge in the future government." If the Paris conference cannot reach an agreement on the issue of a joint government, Cambodia's seat in the United Nations this year will not be vacant. The old United Nations resolution, after some modifications, will still be useful. ASEAN will draft a United Nations resolution before the General Assembly convenes this year.

### 由于与柬埔寨接壤  泰不参加国际监督小组

    由于与柬埔寨接壤
    泰不参加国际监督小组
    本报曼谷6月28日电　记者刘爱成报道：泰国外长西提希望8月在巴黎召开的关于柬埔寨问题的国际会议能产生查核越南从柬埔寨撤军的国际监督机构，但他排除了泰国参加该机构的可能性。
    西提外长是昨天在接受《曼谷邮报》记者专访时作出上述表示的。
    他说，“我之所以认为泰国不应该在这个机构扮演角色，是由于我们同柬埔寨接壤，有着共同的边界。国际监督机构也将在泰柬边界执行任务，在这种情况下，如果我们参加国际监督机构的话，将会使我们很尴尬。”
    西提说，“在泰国参加国际监督机构问题上，我的态度同军方已表明的态度一样。作为柬埔寨的近邻，在这件事情上我们又处于被告地位，因此，我们不想同这个监督机构发生任何关系。”但他表示，泰国可作为观察员。
    他还说，一些东盟国家可能参加国际监督机构。
    在谈及柬未来政权及其在联合国席位问题时，西提指出，“柬四方共同掌权是关键。四方联合临时政府是必要的。排除任何一方都将会破坏和平谈判。东盟主张红色高棉参加未来政府。”如果巴黎会议不能在四方联合政府问题上达成协议，柬今年在联合国的席位将不会空缺，旧的联合国决议在作某些修改之后仍将有用。东盟将在今年联大召开之前起草好联合国决议草案。
