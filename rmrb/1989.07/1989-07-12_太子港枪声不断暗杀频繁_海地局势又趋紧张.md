Port-au-Prince, July 12 (Xinhua) — In recent days, the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince has been plagued by continuous gunfire and frequent assassinations, leading to a tense situation.

According to reports, during the day, Port-au-Prince is bustling with people and vehicles, but as night falls, the streets are nearly deserted, with only soldiers patrolling. In some slums, gunshots can occasionally be heard.

Last week, the brother of a Haitian political leader was murdered. On the 9th, a military officer from the presidential guard was also killed by a group of people. On the 10th, three bodies, shot to death, were found lying in the streets. Haitian President Avril told foreign journalists on the 10th that even his own safety could not be guaranteed. Political observers believe that the Avril government has lost control of the country, and a coup could happen at any time.

This year, on April 2nd and 5th, Haiti experienced two failed military coup attempts aimed at overthrowing the Avril government.

    太子港枪声不断暗杀频繁
    海地局势又趋紧张
    新华社北京7月12日电  太子港消息：近日来，海地首都太子港枪声不断，暗杀频繁发生，局势又趋紧张。
    据报道，首都太子港白天人来车往，夜幕降临后，大街上行人稀少，只有士兵在巡逻，在一些贫民区不时可听到枪声。
    上星期，海地一名政治领导人的兄弟遭到杀害。9日，总统卫队的一名军官又被一伙人杀死。10日，人们发现3具用枪打死的尸体躺在大街上。海地总统阿夫里尔10日对外国记者说，他自己的人身安全也不能得到保障。政治观察家认为，阿夫里尔政府已失去对国家的控制，政变随时可能发生。
    今年4月2日和5日，海地接连发生了2次企图推翻阿夫里尔政府的未遂军事政变。
