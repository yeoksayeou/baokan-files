Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24th.

The State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau has formulated anti-corruption measures to resolutely combat corruption.

Jiang Ming, Director of the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, stated at a nationwide telephone conference of the tobacco industry held today that all levels of leadership should prioritize the investigation and prosecution of major cases as the primary task in combating corruption. To this end, local tobacco monopoly systems should carefully sort through cases, proceed from reality, and expedite the resolution of typical cases with severe circumstances and widespread public outrage within a short period.

Jiang Ming emphasized that from now on, officials from the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and its companies, whether they are leading cadres or ordinary cadres, are strictly prohibited from hosting banquets for welcoming or seeing off visitors, accepting gifts and local specialties, staying in high-end hotels, paying for meals according to regulations, and not distributing souvenirs at meetings.

Jiang Ming said that in recent years, the tobacco industry has seen an increase in corruption issues such as embezzlement, bribery, and illegal trading. Although some major cases have been handled, corruption has not been completely eradicated. Since this year, in the tobacco system of Hunan Province alone, 23 people have been arrested for bribery and illegal trading of tobacco, including 2 who were directors of county-level tobacco monopoly bureaus. These cases involve 9 units, including Chengzhou Tobacco Factory, Changde Tobacco Factory, Xinshao Tobacco Factory, Yueyang City, Huachong County, Linxiang County, Yuanling County, and Fenghuang County.

In response to the current situation in the tobacco industry, Jiang Ming proposed three requirements for combating corruption: First, anti-corruption measures should be visible, tangible, and practical; second, they should be seriously implemented, and violators will be held accountable without exception; third, starting from the leadership organs and leading cadres, a hierarchical responsibility system should be established, and regular self-inspections should be conducted.

    烟草行业抓紧查处大要案
    专卖局制定廉政措施惩治腐败
    新华社北京7月24日电  国家烟草专卖局制定廉政措施，坚决惩治腐败。
    国家烟草专卖局局长江明在今天召开的全国烟草行业电话会议上提出，各级领导要把查处大案要案的工作作为惩治腐败的首要任务抓紧抓好。为此，各地烟草专卖系统要认真排排队，从实际出发，对那些情节恶劣，群众义愤大的典型案件抓紧在短期内结案处理。
    江明强调，今后国家烟草专卖局及公司的干部下去，不管是领导干部还是一般干部，一律不准设宴接风、饯行，不准接受礼品和土特产品，不准住高级宾馆，吃饭按规定付款，开会不发纪念品。
    江明说，近年来烟草行业的贪污受贿、倒买倒卖等腐败现象有所增加，虽然对一些重大案件做了处理，但仍未杜绝。今年以来，仅湖南省烟草系统因受贿、倒卖烟草被捕的就有23人，其中2人是县级烟草专卖局局长。这些案件涉及到郴州烟厂、常德烟厂、新邵烟厂、岳阳市、华容县、临湘县、沅陵县、凤凰县等9个单位。
    针对当前烟草行业的实际情况，江明对惩治腐败提出三点要求：一是制订廉政措施要看得见，摸得着，切实可行；二是要认真付诸实行，违者必究，不搞下不为例；三是从领导机关、领导干部做起，建立层层责任制，定期进行对照检查。
