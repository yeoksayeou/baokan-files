The city of Yuanjiang currently has 14,919 individual and private enterprises, with a total capital of over 29.43 million yuan. Since 1988, the city's Individual Laborers Association has launched the "Four Wealths and Four Remembrances" campaign among its members, encouraging them to remember the Party's goal of common prosperity, contribute to the nation, value science and technology, and adhere to national policies and regulations while pursuing wealth.

Private entrepreneur Gan Liangren helped over 70 impoverished farmers overcome financial difficulties for spring planting by issuing interest-free loans totaling 20,000 yuan in early March. In the winter of the previous year, individual entrepreneur Cai Lihui from Xinxing Village in Fuxing Township contributed 2,000 yuan to build a long-awaited concrete bridge over the Caoyang Canal at the junction of Beisheng and Yangluo in Fuxing. In January, private entrepreneur Chen Yongxiang from Yangluo donated 100,000 yuan worth of materials to help repair school buildings in Yangluo Township.

The city's Individual Laborers Association has also addressed the issue of weak legal awareness among some individual entrepreneurs by conducting multi-level legal education. Over the past year, they have organized 24 legal education classes, reaching over 20,000 people. In 1988, the number of economic cases involving individual and private enterprises significantly decreased, and issues such as short-weighting, adulteration, and passing off inferior goods as superior ones in the market also notably declined. Over the past year, the city has seen a surge in law-abiding, civilized, model tax-paying, and diligent entrepreneurs.

    沅江市个体私营企业守法经营
    我市现有个体、私营企业户14919户，拥有资金2943万多元。1988年以来，我市个体劳动者协会在全市个体协会会员中，开展了乡村首富户不忘党的共同富裕目标、自我致富不忘对国家的贡献、勤劳致富不忘科学技术、大胆致富不忘国家政策和法规的“四富四不忘”活动。私营企业主甘良仁为了帮助70多户贫困农民解决春耕生产资金紧缺的困难，今年3月初，向这些农户发放无息贷款2万元。复兴乡新村个体户蔡立辉于去年冬天，拿出2000元建起了一座长期未解决的北胜与阳罗复兴交界的草阳运河水泥红砖桥。今年1月间，阳罗私营企业主陈永湘拿出1万元物资捐助阳罗镇学校维修校舍。
    我市个体协会还针对一些个体户法制观念淡薄，法律意识不强的问题，开展了多层次普法教育。去年以来，他们举办了24期法制学习班，2万多人受到法制教育。1988年全市个体和私营的经济案件大幅度减少，市场上的缺斤少两、掺杂使假、以次充好等现象也明显下降。一年多以来，全市涌现出了大量的守法经营户、文明经商户、模范纳税户、勤劳致富户。
