The Central Propaganda Department and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice to forward the report from the Beijing Garrison on "The Work of the Military-Civilian Joint Construction Point Liuyin Street in Stopping the Turmoil and Suppressing the Riots." The notice requires all regions to continue to deepen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

The notice states that over the years, the military and civilians of Liuyin Street have conscientiously implemented the line, principles, and policies of the Party's Eleventh Plenary Session of the Third Central Committee. They have carried out military-civilian joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization, continuously improving the ideological and moral standards of the people, forming a "Liuyin New Wind" that embodies socialist spiritual civilization, and achieving remarkable results in all aspects of the street's work. Especially after the student turmoil in April this year, the street's Party organization took a clear stance against the turmoil and riots, stood up, and resolutely fought against various forms of turmoil and riotous behavior with a just cause. They demonstrated a firm political stance, a high level of socialist consciousness, and a lofty patriotic spirit. Their experience powerfully illustrates that as long as spiritual civilization construction is emphasized in peacetime, ideological and political work is continuously strengthened, and the Party's line, principles, policies, and the education of the four cardinal principles are implemented at the grassroots level, their effectiveness will be fully demonstrated in critical moments. The three experiences summarized in the report are precisely what has been relaxed or abandoned in many places over the past few years. After stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots, these experiences have become even more valuable. The military has focused on the grassroots level in recent years and achieved remarkable results. The same should be done in the localities. We should learn from the experience of Liuyin Street, focus on grassroots construction, do a good job in all aspects of basic work, and lay a solid foundation for the socialist cause.

The notice points out that over the years, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the entire army, together with the people of all ethnic groups across the country, have jointly carried out the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, carried forward the glorious traditions of the Party and the army, and demonstrated strong vitality. It has been proven that military-civilian joint construction activities are effective measures for strengthening military-political and military-civilian unity in the new period and are a good form for the army to participate in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. It is hoped that all levels of Party organizations will strengthen their leadership of this activity, adhere to the principle of local leadership, vigorously strengthen ideological and political work, adhere to the four cardinal principles, resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization, and persist in various good forms of mass spiritual civilization construction activities such as military-civilian joint construction. Use socialist ideology to occupy every position in the ideological field and promote the development of China's reform and opening up and the cause of the four modernizations.

    中宣部总政治部通知各地
    学习柳荫街军民共建经验
    将四项原则教育落实基层
    据新华社北京7月24日电  中共中央宣传部、解放军总政治部最近为转发北京卫戍区《关于军民共建点柳荫街在制止动乱平息暴乱中的工作情况报告》发出通知，要求全国各地军民继续深入开展社会主义精神文明建设。
    《通知》说，多年来，柳荫街道军民认真贯彻党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，深入开展军民共建社会主义精神文明活动，人们的思想水平和道德水平不断提高，形成了一种体现社会主义精神文明的“柳荫新风”，使这条街道的各项工作都取得了显著成绩。特别是今年4月份发生学潮以后，街道党组织旗帜鲜明地反对动乱和暴乱，挺身而出，理直气壮地同各种动乱、暴乱行为作坚决的斗争，表现了坚定的政治立场、高度的社会主义觉悟和崇高的爱国主义精神。他们的经验有力地说明，只要平时重视搞好精神文明建设，坚持不懈地加强思想政治工作，把党的路线、方针、政策和四项基本原则教育落实到基层，关键时刻就会显示威力。报告总结的3条经验，恰是这几年在相当多的一些地方被放松或丢掉了的。经过制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱，这些经验益发显得可贵。军队这几年下功夫抓了基层，取得了显著效果。地方也应当如此。我们要学习柳荫街道的经验，下大功夫抓好基层建设，做好各方面的基础工作，打牢社会主义事业的根基。
    《通知》指出，多年来，全军广大指战员同全国各族人民一道，共同开展建设社会主义精神文明活动，弘扬了我党我军的光荣传统，显示了强大的生命力。事实证明，军民共建活动是新时期加强军政军民团结的有效措施，是我军参加社会主义精神文明建设的一个好形式。希望各级党组织加强对这一活动的领导，坚持以地方领导为主等原则，大力加强思想政治工作，坚持四项基本原则，坚决反对资产阶级自由化，坚持类似军民共建活动这样的群众性的建设精神文明的各种好形式，用社会主义思想占领意识形态领域各个阵地，推进我国的改革开放和四个现代化建设事业的发展。
