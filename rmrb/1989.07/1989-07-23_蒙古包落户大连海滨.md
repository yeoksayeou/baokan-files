Yurts have settled in Dalian's coastal area. On a hillside in Baiyun Villa Park near the sea, dozens of yurts resemble large white mushrooms.

The yurts vary in size, with a total of 37. Among them, 28 are used for accommodation, offering rooms for two or four people. The remaining yurts serve as tea houses, restaurants, meeting rooms, and other ancillary facilities.

These yurts are operated by the Dalian Municipal Construction Bureau.

Staying in a yurt, sleeping on Mongolian-style wooden beds, and enjoying authentic dishes like roasted mutton and hand-pulled noodles allow visitors to experience the rich Mongolian culture.

Facing the boundless sea, visitors can savor roasted mutton while also enjoying seafood such as crabs and scallops.

    蒙古包落户大连海滨
    新华社大连七月二十三日电　（记者阎平）蒙古包已落户大连海滨。在白云山庄公园靠海的一座山坡上，几十顶蒙古包犹如一只只大白蘑菇。
    蒙古包大小不一，共有三十七顶，其中供住宿的有二十八顶，有二人一间或四人一间的，其余为奶茶馆、餐厅、会议室等附属设施。
    这些蒙古包是大连市城建局经营的。
    住蒙古包，睡蒙古式木床、吃地道的烤羊腿、手扒肉，能让人感受到浓郁的蒙古风情。
    蒙古包面对一望无垠的大海，游人在品味烤羊腿的同时，还可吃到螃蟹、扇贝等海鲜。
