On the afternoon of July 3, a light rain fell from the sky.

That morning, General Der Wei, Chief of the General Staff, attended a naming ceremony held by the Beijing Military Region. At the meeting, an order signed by Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Central Military Commission was read out: awarding the title of "Guardian of the Republic" to martyr Liu Guogang and others. Liu Guogang's father, Liu Zhirong—a disabled veteran with a cane—spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, Der Wei's heart was unsettled for a long time, and he decided to visit the martyr's father again.

This was his fifth visit to the martyr's family. However, due to the urgency of time, he had not been able to fully express his feelings. This time, he wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk with the martyr's father.

Liu Guogang, a 25-year-old lieutenant, was a platoon leader who sacrificed his life during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital. On the night of June 3, 1989, Liu Guogang's unit was ordered to advance towards Tiananmen Square. Along the way, they were repeatedly attacked by rioters. He braved the flying stones and bottles, fighting against rioters who tried to set the car on fire. His left arm and left hand were injured. Enduring the pain, he led the car to break through the siege and arrived at the north side of the Great Hall of the People by dawn on June 4. When he learned that three vehicles from his unit had been damaged and were stranded on the way, and the leadership decided to go and tow the vehicles to rescue the people, he volunteered to lead a driver, carrying steel ropes to go to the rescue. They broke through the blockade lines set up by the rioters and rushed to the vicinity of the Telegraph Building. A group of rioters rushed over, and bricks, bottles, and sticks rained down on their heads and chests. The driver was knocked unconscious and sent to the hospital. Liu Guogang, alone, faced the frenzied rioters fearlessly and fought his way out. However, outnumbered, he was killed by the rioters in a very cruel manner. After his death, he was burned by the rioters. Later, he was disemboweled by another rioter.

The martyr's father showed great strength, shedding not a single tear in front of leaders at all levels, and sent his daughter to the army to take over her brother's gun.

The old comrades-in-arms met. One was a farmer in ordinary clothes, and the other was a general with three stars on his shoulders; one had just come from the golden wheat fields, and the other had just stepped out of the martial law command center.

Der Wei held Liu Zhirong's hands tightly with both of his hands.

The provincial and municipal leaders who accompanied the martyr's family to Beijing, and the political commissar of the Beijing Military Region, Liu Zhenhua, gathered around.

The flashlights flashed and flickered, and the reporters captured this heartfelt moment.

"Where is your daughter? Didn't your daughter come?" Der Wei asked.

The staff led Liu Guogang's sister into the room.

Der Wei gently patted her shoulder and said, "I saw you on TV wearing a military uniform, that's good, you prefer military uniforms over red dresses! Sit down!"

The two comrades sat down, but their hands remained tightly clasped, still resting on the armrest of the sofa.

"I have been unable to control my emotions since I met you," Der Wei said. "There is an old saying, 'A hero sheds blood but not tears.' But since the incident with Guogang, I and Political Commissar Liu, who have come through the years of war, have been unable to control our emotions and have shed tears more than once.

"After listening to your speech this morning, I was very moved and my heart was unsettled. We are proud and gratified to have a good son like Guogang and a good comrade like him. Plus, we have another layer of relationship. During the War of Liberation, we were in the same column and both participated in the Menglianggu Battle. We were also both injured in this battle, so we feel even closer. You were injured twice in the Menglianggu and Nanma battles, right?"

"Yes."

"I was too. I was lightly injured in Menglianggu and seriously injured in Nanma. You lost a leg in this battle, and I used a cane for five months because of a leg injury." He said, pulling up his trouser leg to reveal a palm-sized scar on his lower leg.

"This incident with Guogang would be difficult for anyone. But as people who have come through the years of war, we have today all thanks to the Party's leadership and the nurturing of the people. During the war, the people of Shandong, the people of Nanma and Linqu, endured hunger and hardship for us. Thinking of this, our hearts are filled with gratitude.

"As old comrades, I am proud that you have raised a good son like Guogang. Because we are both from the same trench, we both drank the water of Shandong and ate the corn porridge of Shandong to survive, and we both enjoyed the deep affection of the people of Shandong. Shandong is a place where heroes are born. Throughout the years and generations, many heroes and heroes have emerged. But as Chairman Mao Zedong said: 'When counting the heroes of the past and present, we should look at today.' Guogang is a hero of the new era. His loyalty to the Party and the country, his fearlessness in the face of difficulties, his heroic spirit of pressing forward, his selflessness in dedicating himself to national defense, all surpass us and are models for today's youth, forever our examples to learn from. Chairman Deng personally signed the order to award him the title of 'Guardian of the Republic.' Guogang is truly worthy of it. This is your and your family's honor, the honor of the people of Shandong, and the honor of the People's Liberation Army.

"Guogang's mother did not come. Please convey to Political Commissar Liu and me, these old soldiers' feelings, thanking her for raising such a good son!" He then asked, "Has her rheumatoid arthritis improved?"

Liu Zhirong's eyes welled up with tears, patting Der Wei's hand that was holding his and said, "Thank you, thank you!"

Many comrades present had tears in their eyes. The reporters sat on the ground, excited and quiet, looking at the two comrades and listening to their conversation.

Der Wei said, "In these days, I have received many phone calls and letters from old comrades of the Ninth Column of the Eighth Route Army. They said they saw you on TV and knew you had raised a good son for the country. They asked me to convey their greetings to you and everyone hopes you take good care of your health." He then mentioned a few names.

"Yes, yes," Liu Zhirong's eyes lit up with excitement. "We participated in the Menglianggu battle together. The battle had just started when it began to rain."

"Yes," Der Wei continued, "When we rushed to the halfway up the north mountain of Gaozhuang, a mountain flood broke out."

"I was injured on the west slope of the north mountain."

"I was injured on the east side of the top of the north mountain."

"Because of the heavy bleeding, I was extremely thirsty and lay by the roadside to drink rainwater."

"I used my helmet to scoop water from the puddles to drink. The more I drank, the thirstier I got, and the more water I drank, the more blood I lost."

"If the stretcher bearers had not come in time, I would have died."

"The medic tore off his sleeve to bandage me, and only then did the bleeding stop..."

"And the few comrades who came out with me were all martyred."

The two old soldiers fell silent, and the entire scene fell silent. They mourned and paid tribute in their hearts to the countless martyrs who had sacrificed their lives.

After a long silence, Der Wei raised his voice, "You spoke very well this morning. The republic that countless martyrs and we have exchanged for with our lives and blood cannot be overturned by these rioters. Those who advocate bourgeois liberalization, those social dregs, including the careerists and conspirators within the Party, who try to overthrow the republic and overthrow the Communist Party through this riot, their plots must not succeed. The suppression of this riot relies on the correct decision of the Party Central Committee, the wise and decisive leadership of Chairman Deng Xiaoping and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, and also on the bravery and tenacity of the People's Liberation Army. It is difficult to shake the mountains, but it is even more difficult to shake the People's Liberation Army. It was so in the past, it is so now, and it will be so in the future."

At this moment, Political Commissar Liu Zhenhua pointed to a tall soldier in front of him and introduced, "This is Comrade Shi Xiang of our military region, a writer."

Der Wei said, "He is the author of the lyrics to 'The Moon on the Fifteenth Night,' a prolific poet and writer."

Liu Zhenhua continued, "He is preparing to write a book about Comrade Liu Guogang."

"That's great," Der Wei said. "We should write extensively about our 'Guardians of the Republic' and write big about them. We should also criticize bourgeois liberalization extensively. In the past few years, bourgeois liberalization has been rampant, praising the Communist Party and the people has been seen as conservative and outdated, while cursing the Communist Party and slandering the masses has been praised as open and revolutionary. The good is not fragrant, and the bad is not smelly. This inversion of right and wrong should be corrected!"

Liu Zhirong said, "Yes, it cannot continue like this!"

Der Wei said, "Chairman Deng said it well, we should calmly consider the past and the future. Through the suppression of this riot, we should thoroughly clean up those illegal organizations. Just as you said, we must not be lenient with a few bad people. Indulging bad people is a crime against good people..."

A little while later, Der Wei turned to the martyr's sister and asked, "Which unit have you been assigned to?"

Political Commissar Liu Zhenhua replied on her behalf, "To the unit where her brother served."

Der Wei said, "The army is a vast place where you can soar and dance. I believe you will surely inherit your brother's legacy."

The martyr's sister nodded, and her bright eyes showed a determined light.

"You should often write to your father and mother, reporting your progress, so they won't worry about you."

Time flew by. Unknowingly, the clock hand ticked away one circle after another...

    战友情深
    贺茂之
    7月3日傍晚，天空下起了细雨。
    这天上午，迟浩田总参谋长参加了北京军区召开的命名大会，会上宣读了中央军委邓小平主席签署的命令：授予刘国庚等烈士“共和国卫士”荣誉称号。刘国庚的父亲刘志荣——一位拄着拐杖的残废军人讲了话。会后归来，迟浩田心里久久没有平静，决定再去看望烈士的父亲。
    他已经是第五次看望烈士的亲人了。但终因时间紧迫，未能尽诉情怀。此次，他要和烈士的父亲拉拉心里话。
    刘国庚这位25岁的少尉排长，是在平息首都反革命暴乱中壮烈牺牲的。1989年6月3日晚，刘国庚所在部队奉命向天安门广场开进，沿途屡遭暴徒袭击。他迎着纷飞的石块、瓶子，与企图纵火烧车的暴徒进行斗争，左臂和左手受伤。他忍着伤痛，带车冲击重围，于4日凌晨按时到达人民大会堂北侧。当他得知本单位还有3辆车遭破坏困在途中、领导决定去拖车救人时，他自告奋勇，带一名司机，抬着钢丝绳前去援救。他们冲破了暴徒们制造的一道道封锁线，突进到电报大楼附近，一群暴徒猛扑过来，砖石、瓶子、棍棒雨点般打在他们的头部、胸部，司机当场打昏，被送往医院。刘国庚只身一人，面对疯狂的暴徒，毫无惧色，奋勇突围。但终因寡不敌众，被暴徒用极其残忍的手段杀害。牺牲后，又遭暴徒焚烧。此后，又被一暴徒割腹。
    烈士的父亲表现了极大的坚强，在各级领导面前没流一滴眼泪，又把自己的女儿送到部队去接哥哥的枪。
    老战友见面了。一个衣着普通的农民，一个肩扛三星的将军；一个刚从金色麦田里赶来，一个方自戒严指挥部走出。
    迟浩田双手紧紧握着刘志荣的手。
    专程陪烈士亲人来京的省、市领导同志和北京军区政委刘振华围了上来。
    闪光灯灯光纵横闪烁，记者们摄下了这情深意长的镜头。
      “你的姑娘呢？姑娘没有来吗？”迟浩田问。
    工作人员把国庚的妹妹领了进来。
    迟浩田轻轻抚着她的肩头说：“在电视里看到你穿上军装了，很好，你这是不爱红装爱武装呀！坐吧！”
    两位战友坐下了，手却没有松开，仍然紧紧握着搭在沙发扶手上。
    “我自从见了你，总是控制不住自己的感情。”迟浩田说：“有句老话说，壮士流血不流泪。但是，自国庚的事情发生之后，我和刘政委这些从战争年代过来的人总是控制不住自己的感情，不止一次地流泪。
    “今天上午听了你的讲话之后，很激动，心里很不平静。我们为你有国庚这样的好孩子，为我们有他这样的好战友，感到自豪和欣慰。加上我们俩还有层关系，解放战争时期我们在一个纵队，都参加了孟良崮战役，又都是在这场战役中负的伤，就更感到亲近了。你在孟良崮、在南麻负了两次伤，是吗？”
    “是的。”
    “我也是。在孟良崮受了次轻伤，在南麻负了重伤。你在这场战役中丢了一条腿，我腿部受伤拄了5个月的拐杖。”说着，提起了裤腿，露出了小腿处手掌般大的伤痕。
    “国庚这件事放在谁身上都难过。但是，作为我们从战争年代过来的人，能有今天，全靠党的指引，靠人民的培育。打仗那阵儿，沂蒙山的人民，南麻、临朐的人民，忍饥挨饿为着我们。想想这些，心里就充满了感激。
    “作为老战友，我为你培养出国庚这样的好孩子感到自豪，因为我们俩是一个战壕里滚出来的，我们都是喝沂蒙山的水，吃沂蒙山的小米粥活过来的，都饱享了山东人民的厚意深情。山东是英雄辈出的地方。历年历代，英雄好汉出了不少。但是，毛泽东主席说过：‘数风流人物还看今朝’。国庚就是新时代的英雄。他忠诚于党、忠诚于祖国的高尚情操，他不畏艰难、一往无前的英雄气概，他不计名利、献身国防的崇高品质，都超过了我们，是当代青年的楷模，永远是我们学习的榜样。邓主席亲自签署命令授予他‘共和国卫士’荣誉称号，国庚是当之无愧的。这是你和你全家的光荣，是山东人民的光荣，也是我们解放军的光荣。
    “国庚的母亲没有来，请你转告刘政委和我这些老兵的心情，谢谢她养育了这么个好儿子！”遂又问道，“她的风湿性关节炎现在好些了吗？”
    刘志荣的眼睛湿润了，拍了拍迟浩田握着他手的手背说：“谢谢，谢谢！”
    在场不少同志的眼睛湿润了。记者们均席地而坐，激动而又安静地望着这两位战友，倾听着他们的交谈。
    迟浩田说：“这些日子，我接到不少华野九纵老战友的电话和来信。他们说在电视里看到了你，知道你为祖国培养出了个好儿子。他们让我代他们向你问好，大家都希望你多多保重身体。”接着说出了几个名字。
      “认识，认识。”刘志荣眼睛里溢出了兴奋的光彩，“我们一起参加的孟良崮战斗，战斗打响不久就下开了雨。”
    “对，”迟浩田接道，“冲到高庄北山半腰时，就暴发了山洪。”
      “我就是在北山的西腰上负的伤。”
      “我是在北山的山顶东侧被炸伤了腿。”
    “受伤流血很多，口渴得要命，我就伏在路旁的水洼里喝雨水。”
    “我是用钢盔舀水坑的水喝，越喝越口渴，水喝得越多，血流得也越多。”
      “要不是担架队员来得及时，我就没命了。”
    “卫生员撕下褂袖子为我包扎，才止住了血……”
      “和我一起出来的几个同志都牺牲了。”
    两位老战士沉默了，整个现场沉默了。他们在心里为无数牺牲的烈士默哀、致敬。
    半晌，迟浩田提高了声音：“你今天上午讲得很对，无数先烈和我们用生命、鲜血换来的共和国，不能让这些暴徒们颠覆。那些搞资产阶级自由化的家伙，那些社会渣滓，包括党内的野心家、阴谋家，妄图借此暴乱推翻共和国，打倒共产党，绝不能让他们的阴谋得逞。平息这场暴乱，靠的是党中央的正确决策，靠的是邓小平主席为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家的英明果断，也靠的是解放军英勇顽强。撼山易，撼解放军难。过去是，现在是，将来还是。”
    此时，刘振华政委指了指面前的一高个儿军人介绍说：“这是我们军区的作家石祥同志。”
    迟浩田说：“是《十五的月亮》歌词的作者，是位多产诗人、作家。”
    刘振华接着说：“他准备写本国庚同志的书。”
      “很好。”迟浩田说，“对我们的‘共和国卫士’要大写特写，大书特书。对资产阶级自由化也要大批特批。过去的几年，资产阶级自由化猖獗，歌颂共产党、歌颂人民的被视为僵化、保守，咒骂共产党、诬蔑人民大众的被捧为开放、革命。好的不香，坏的不臭。这种被颠倒的是非，应该把它颠倒过来！”
    刘志荣说：“是的，不能再继续下去了！”
    迟浩田说：“邓主席讲得好，我们要冷静地考虑过去，考虑未来。通过这次平息暴乱，要把那些非法组织彻底地清理清理。正像你说的那样对少数坏人绝不能心慈手软。对坏人的姑息，就是对好人的犯罪。”……
    稍倾，迟浩田又转向烈士的妹妹，问道：“分到哪个部队了？”
    刘振华代为回答说：“到他哥哥生前的团里。”
    迟浩田说：“部队天地广阔，可以飞可以舞，我相信你定能继承哥哥的遗志。”
    烈士的妹妹点了点头，那晶亮的眸子里流露出坚定的光。
    “要经常给你爸爸妈妈写信，汇报自己的进步，免得你爸爸妈妈记挂。”
    情长嫌时短。不知不觉中，时针划过了一周，又一周……
