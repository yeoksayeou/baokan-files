Austria to Apply for Membership in the European Community

Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 30th - After a heated debate, the Austrian National Assembly last night approved the government's report on applying for membership in the European Community.

With this, the main domestic obstacles for Austria to join the European internal market and eventually fully join the European Community have been removed. It is expected that the Austrian government will formally submit its application to the Community in July.

Austrian government leaders have repeatedly emphasized that Austria's application to join the European Community will not shake its permanent neutrality policy. In future negotiations with the Community, maintaining Austria's neutral status will be an unshakable precondition.

    奥地利将申请加入欧共体
    新华社维也纳6月30日电　奥地利国民议会经过激烈辩论，昨天晚上批准了政府关于申请加入欧洲共同体的报告。
    至此，奥地利申请加入欧洲内部大市场，进而完全加入欧洲共同体的国内主要障碍已经消除，预计奥政府将于7月正式向共同体递交申请书。
    奥政府领导人一再重申，奥地利申请加入欧洲共同体决不会动摇永久中立政策，在将来同共同体的谈判中，保留奥地利中立地位将是一个不可动摇的前提。
