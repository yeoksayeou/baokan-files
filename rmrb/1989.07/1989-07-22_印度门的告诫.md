New Delhi in the summer, with daytime temperatures soaring to 45 degrees Celsius, is unbearably hot. However, New Delhi after sunset comes alive. Men, women, and children leave their stifling homes to gather in the streets and outdoors. India Gate is a popular destination for many residents.

India Gate is a triumphal arch built to commemorate the 90,000 Indian soldiers who died in World War I. It is also known as the "Indian Soldier Memorial." Completed in 1931, it stands 48.7 meters tall and is entirely constructed from red sandstone. Visitors can ascend to the top via a stone staircase. India Gate is located in the center of Children's Park at the eastern end of Kingsway. It stands opposite the Presidential Palace, surrounded by lawns, two large fountains, and crisscrossing water channels, making for a pleasant scene.

Every evening until late at night, crowds flock here to cool off. Some open their lunch boxes and enjoy a family dinner; others gather to chat or play cards. Street vendors hawk colorful balloons, drinks, and ice cream; children tug at their parents' hands, demanding toys or sweets. Over there, young men kick a ball around and play, while nearby, a few girls laugh and play games under the lamplight. Naturally, India Gate also provides a spot for lovers to meet, where they can share their feelings under the cover of broad-leaved trees.

During festivals, the entire area transforms into a celebration square. India Gate stands tall amidst the noise and excitement. The eternal flame within the arch and the names of 36,000 fallen soldiers engraved on the walls serve as a reminder to people around the world to understand each other and maintain peace.

    印度门的告诫
    吴德融
    夏季的新德里，白天气温高达45摄氏度，令人难熬。然而，日落后的新德里又充满了生机。男女老幼纷纷离开闷热的住所涌向街头和野外。印度门是许多居民爱去的地方。
    印度门是一座凯旋门式的建筑物，为纪念第一次世界大战中牺牲的9万名印度士兵而建，又名“印度战士纪念塔”。它1931年竣工，高48.7米，全部用红砂石砌成，循石阶可登临顶部。印度门位于儿童公园中心，国王大道的东端。与总统府遥遥相望，周围是草坪绿地、两个大型喷水池和纵横交叉的水渠，景色宜人。
    每天晚上直至深夜，这里吸引着大批人群前来纳凉。有的打开饭盒，合家围着进晚餐；有的聚首聊天或玩纸牌；流动的小商贩兜售着彩色气球、饮料和冰糕；孩子们牵着父母的手嚷着要买玩具或糖果。这边一些小伙子们串来串去踢球嬉戏，那里几个姑娘在灯光下做游戏，笑声不止。自然，印度门也给人们提供了幽会的场所，他们在深色的阔叶树荫的遮掩下互诉衷情。
    每逢节日这里整个场地就变成了欢庆的广场。印度门在一片喧闹中巍然矗立。拱门内的长明灯火和两侧墙上镌刻着的3万6千个阵亡士兵的名字提醒着世界各国人民要相互理解和维护和平。
