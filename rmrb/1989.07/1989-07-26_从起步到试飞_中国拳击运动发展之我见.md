In the preliminary rounds of the 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championships, the young Chinese team, although not having a high win rate and with mediocre results, still managed to surprise their opponents and the international boxing community with their performance.

Two years ago, when the Chinese boxing team made their debut in the Asian Games, they were eliminated in the first round. At that time, the young men with "China" on their chests had rigid techniques and monotonous tactics, rarely getting the chance to attack. Now, they not only can rely on their strength to compete with their opponents, using both brains and brawn, but also often use swift punches and agile footwork to create opportunities for victory. Statistics show that out of the 9 Chinese athletes who have competed, 6 had a higher score than their opponents at the start of the match. This indicates that after two years of hard work, Chinese boxing has successfully transitioned from its initial stage and is now challenging the Asian powers.

The Chinese athletes who lost in the preliminary rounds this time were more than half due to not seizing the opportunity to win in time. It cannot be denied that there is a reason for their lack of competition experience compared to their opponents, but the main reason is that their training time is too short and their basic skills are not solid. For example, the 54kg level athlete Chen Yuan used varied combinations of punches to repeatedly attack, pushing his opponent into a corner. However, during the attack, he neglected his defense, resulting in being hit by his opponent's sudden hook punch to the jaw, turning victory into defeat. In another example, in the 75kg level match, Liu Xinjun knocked down a South Korean athlete with one punch in the first round. However, due to his lack of accuracy, many of his punches missed, causing a large amount of energy to be wasted. As a result, when his opponent kept exposing weaknesses, he was unable to strike the final decisive blow, ultimately failing and squandering his previous efforts.

In the three-day preliminaries, Chinese athletes showed significant progress, but also exposed their shortcomings. Compared to North Korean athletes, they are on par in terms of agility and tactical combinations, but there is a significant gap in accuracy. Compared to the Syrian athletes who won consecutive matches, they are roughly equal in the power of their rear-hand punches, but their ability to withstand punches is obviously inferior. It is hoped that the Chinese boxing team will use this opportunity to face the gaps, train harder, and achieve good results in next year's Asian Games.

    从起步到试飞
    ——中国拳击运动发展之我见
    在第14届亚洲业余拳击锦标赛预赛中，年轻的中国队虽胜率不高，战绩欠佳，然而他们的表现却着实令对手、令观赛的国际拳击界人士吃惊。
    两年前，初出茅庐的中国拳击队首次在亚洲赛上亮相，第一轮全军便遭淘汰。那时，胸前标着中国字样的小伙子们拳法呆板、战术单调，难得有出击机会。如今，他们不仅能凭借实力与对手抗衡周旋，斗智斗勇，还常常利用迅捷的出打和灵巧的步伐，为自己创造出取胜的机会。据统计，已出场的9名中国选手中，有6人在开打之初其点数上优于对手。这表明，经过两年的刻苦努力，中国拳击运动已成功地跨越了起步阶段，进入向亚洲诸强挑战的行列。
    这次在预赛阶段失利的中国选手，半数以上是由于没有及时抓住胜机。不可否认，这里有比赛经验逊于对手的原因，但更主要的还是由于训练时间过短，基本功不扎实所致。如54公斤级选手陈渊，曾利用多变的组合拳连连进击，把对手逼入绝境，可是进攻中却疏于防守，结果被对手冷不丁地一记摆拳击中下颚，反胜为败。再如75公斤级比赛中，刘新军在第一回合曾将南朝鲜选手一拳击倒，可因准确性差，出拳落空多，体力大量消耗，以致后来当对手不断漏出破绽时，自己却无力击出最后的致命一拳，竟而功亏一篑，前功尽弃。
    在三天预赛中，中国选手显示了他们的长足进步，同时，也暴露了他们的不足之处。和朝鲜选手相比，他们在动作敏捷、战术组合方面相差无几，但在落点的准确性方面却有较大差距；和连战连捷的叙利亚选手相比，他们在后手拳的力量上大致相当，但抗击打能力明显逊色。希望中国拳击队借此次大赛机会，正视差距，更刻苦训练，在明年亚运会上取得好成绩。　本报记者　缪　鲁
