	Reasonable Demand
	— Brazil Calls for Renegotiation of Foreign Debt
	By Lán Cái Jī, Xinhua News Agency

	High-ranking officials from Brazil's Ministry of Finance and Central Bank have recently arrived in the United States to hold urgent consultations with the creditor banks' advisory committee, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank regarding the resumption of foreign debt negotiations. They hope to reach an agreement with the relevant creditor institutions on a debt repayment and loan agreement for the remaining eight months of the current Brazilian government's term.

	It is reported that in the new round of debt negotiations, the Brazilian government will propose two suggestions and demands to banks in the United States and other creditor countries: first, to appropriately reduce the excessively heavy debt repayment burden for Brazil this year; second, to demand that the creditor banks fulfill the already agreed-upon $3.1 billion in new loans to Brazil, to help Brazil repay the $6.7 billion in interest and part of the principal due this year. Some high-ranking Brazilian government officials have hinted through the media that if the above demands are not met, the government, facing difficult circumstances, will delay the repayment period for overdue debts and may once again take measures to suspend debt repayments.

	The Brazilian government's aforementioned demands and proposals come after the recent "Seven-Nation Summit" held in Paris by Western countries. At this meeting, the seven leaders drafted a plan to reduce the debt burden by $24 billion for some third-world debtor countries, aiming to ease the current international debt situation. However, as the largest debtor country in the third world, Brazil, along with Argentina, was excluded from this "aid plan," which the Brazilian government finds incomprehensible. Additionally, Brazil's proposal to renegotiate foreign debt is related to the international financial institutions' adoption of a "delaying tactic" to solve Brazil's debt problem. Some creditor banks have indicated that Brazil will hold a general election in November, and the issue of providing loans should be discussed after the new government is established. In response, the Brazilian government has stated: "If the creditor banks are only willing to provide new loans to the next government, then Brazil's current overdue debts will also have to be repaid by the next government."

	Currently, the call for the Brazilian government to resume dialogue with creditor banks is growing louder among various sectors of Brazilian society. According to recent materials released by the Brazilian Central Bank, Brazil is scheduled to repay $1.56 billion in foreign debts this year; from 1985 to 1988, during the four years of civilian government rule, a total of $36 billion in foreign debt interest was paid; from 1971 to 1988, the cumulative interest paid to various creditor countries, international financial institutions, and commercial banks amounted to $123 billion, far exceeding Brazil's current total foreign debt (approximately $115 billion). Such a heavy debt burden is undoubtedly causing significant difficulties for a developing country.

	Despite this, most Brazilians still hope to resolve the issue through negotiations, seeking partial debt forgiveness from creditor institutions and banks and continuing to provide new loans to ease payment difficulties. The government will do its best to fulfill the debt repayment agreement. They believe that this approach benefits both the debtor and the creditor. However, if the creditor countries and international financial organizations continue to delay providing aid, forcing Brazil to once again take the path of suspending debt repayments, both sides will ultimately suffer losses, resulting in a "lose-lose" situation. This is indeed a matter that creditors should seriously consider.

### 合情合理的呼声——巴西要求重新谈判外债

    合情合理的呼声
    ——巴西要求重新谈判外债
    本报记者  兰才基
    巴西财政部和中央银行的高级官员近日已抵美国，就关于重新举行外债谈判问题与债权银行顾问委员会、国际货币基金组织、世界银行以及泛美开发银行等进行紧急磋商，希望同有关债权机构达成一项本届巴西政府最后8个月执政期间内的还债和贷款协议。
    据透露，在新的债务谈判中，巴西政府将向美国和其它债权国家的银行提出两点建议和要求：一、适当压缩巴西今年负担过分沉重的还债数额；二、要求各债权银行履行已经达成的向巴西提供31亿美元新贷款的协议，以便帮助巴西按期偿付今年到期的67亿美元的债息和部分本金。巴西政府一些高级官员通过新闻媒介预示：如果上述要求得不到实现，政府迫于困难局势，将要拖延到期债务的偿还期限，并有可能再次采取停止偿债的措施。
    巴西政府的上述要求和建议，是在西方国家最近在巴黎举行“七国首脑会议”后提出的。在这次会议上七国首脑拟定了为第三世界一些债务国减轻240亿美元债额负担的计划，以图缓解当前国际债务局势。但是，作为第三世界最大的债务国巴西以及阿根廷，却被排除在这一“援助计划”之外，巴西政府对此感到不可理解。此外，巴西提出重新谈判外债问题，与国际金融机构对解决巴西债务采取“拖延战术”也有关系。一些债权银行放出这样的空气：巴西今年11月将要举行大选，提供借贷的问题要在新政府成立以后再进行磋商。对此，巴西政府已经作出这样的回答：“如果债权银行只愿意向下届政府提供新贷款，那么巴西当前到期的债务也只好留给下届政府去偿还。”
    目前，巴西各界人士要求政府与债权银行重新对话的呼声也日益高涨。据巴西中央银行最近公布的材料，今年内巴西应偿还的外债达156亿美元；自1985年文人政府执政至1988年4年内，付出的外债利息共360亿美元；自1971年至1988年付给各债权国家、国际金融机构及商业银行的债务利息累计达1230亿美元，大大超过了巴西目前所欠外债的总和（约1150亿美元）。这样沉重的债务包袱，对一个发展中国家来说，所造成的困难是可想而知的。
    虽然如此，大多数巴西人目前还是希望通过谈判的方式，争取债权机构和银行宽免一部分债务并继续提供新的借贷来缓解支付困难，政府则尽力履行还债协议。他们认为，这样做无论对债务国或债权者都有好处。但如果债权国家和国际金融组织仍不体谅巴西的困难处境，而对提供援款采取拖延政策，迫使巴西再次走上停止偿债的道路，到头来双方都将遭受损失，造成“两败俱伤”。这的确是值得债权者认真考虑的问题。
