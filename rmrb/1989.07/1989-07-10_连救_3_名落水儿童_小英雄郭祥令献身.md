Guo Xiangling, a seventh-grade student from the Third Middle School in Liangbaosi Town, Jiaxiang County, Shandong Province, bravely saved three drowning children and sacrificed his own life at the age of 12.

On the afternoon of June 7, Guo Xiangling was swimming in a pond outside the village when he suddenly heard cries for help behind him. Turning around, he saw three children struggling in deep water. Without hesitation, Guo Xiangling swam towards them. He successfully rescued all three children to the shore, but unfortunately, he himself sank to the bottom of the 3-meter-deep pond and drowned. The three children he saved were aged 14, 12, and 10.

Guo Xiangling was always willing to help others and excelled in both academics and conduct. In a class of 50 students, 39 had received his help at one time or another. Throughout his six years of schooling, he was consistently named a "Three-Good Student" and an "Excellent Young Pioneer." Recently, the Jiaxiang County Committee decided to launch a campaign to learn from the young hero Guo Xiangling.
