Anyone who respects the facts will acknowledge the great achievements of China's economic development and reform and opening up over the past decade, and will not deny the numerous difficulties and problems that currently exist. Among these, the poor social atmosphere, especially the corrupt practices, is particularly infuriating. The central authorities advocate for the simultaneous promotion of socialist spiritual civilization and material civilization. In my opinion, the former lags behind the latter.

Spiritual civilization construction includes ideological and moral education and scientific and cultural education. Issues in the realm of ideology and morality, such as corrupt practices, have recently been the subject of widespread street talk and heated discussions, becoming a knotty problem in the relationship between the Party and the people, and between the government and the people. The negative factors in Party discipline, government conduct, and social atmosphere are eroding and corrupting our cause, and their momentum is unprecedented since the founding of New China. Various news media have recently exposed cases of "official profiteering," which are the monstrous offspring of various corrupt practices. Among these "official profiteers," there is undoubtedly a considerable proportion of Communist Party members. When these people engage in illegal and disorderly behavior and act recklessly, they probably forget their oath of joining the Party. The key figures in "official profiteering" are officials. When these people stuff the blood and sweat of the state and the people into their own pockets, they probably throw the honorable title of "servant of the people" into the trash can. In the "official profiteering" cases, there are also some "cunning citizens" who either lay bait or act as runners. They probably do not think about the morality of being a Chinese person at all. I agree with the view that our socialist legal system is not yet perfect, so we should strengthen the rule of law; I also agree with the view that our social supervision is insufficient, so we should strengthen supervision. But I think that the root cause of various corrupt phenomena is mainly the low quality of people. If one does not care about right and wrong at all, or completely disregards right and wrong, one can do anything bad. There is nothing more tragic than a dead heart. Those public servants who support and participate in "official profiteering" may have done good things for the people in the past, and some may have even fought on the battlefield, but now they have degenerated and become corrupt, creating small tragedies in a great era.

A certain ideology or belief that dominates social morality often has an immeasurable impact on the development of society at that time. During the land revolution, when people talked about local tyrants and evil gentry, everyone in the red areas wanted to beat them. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, when people mentioned traitors, everyone said they should be killed. During the War of Liberation, when people talked about the Kuomintang army and party, patriots rose up to criticize them. After the founding of New China, socialist transformation and socialist construction attracted billions of people to compete with each other, all striving to move forward. In the past decade, the whole nation has been united in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and "socialist spiritual civilization construction is an important characteristic of socialism." We must firmly grasp this major task, raise people's ideological awareness and moral standards, and have Communist Party members remain loyal to the lofty ideal of communism. State cadres should fulfill their solemn duty as "servants of the people," and the general public should strive to be "four-haves" new people. With legal constraints and public supervision, various corrupt practices and ugly phenomena will lose their soil to exist. This is not an unattainable goal. After liberation, there was such a situation.

Spiritual civilization construction cannot replace the rule of law and supervision, and its unique role cannot be replaced by other forces. It fundamentally improves the quality of people. The ancient saying of "caution in solitude" is a highly self-aware spiritual realm. With such spiritual qualities, and in mutual interaction with the practice of the broad masses, no matter how difficult and arduous the task, it will not be difficult to complete perfectly.

In recent years, the number of articles in newspapers and books that study and promote spiritual civilization is not large, and high-quality ones are even fewer. Comrade Sha Ying has been engaged in theoretical work for half a century, and in recent years, he has focused on studying spiritual civilization issues and has made many innovative contributions in many aspects. His book "Spiritual Civilization: A Comprehensive View" has recently been published. If it can inspire more theoretical works that combine theory with practice to emerge as soon as possible, it is the hope of the author and me, as well as comrades who care about spiritual civilization construction.

    精神文明建设是个大事
    ——《精神文明纵横观》一书的序言
    李庄
    任何一个尊重事实的人，都会承认我国十年来发展经济、改革开放的伟大成绩，都不否认当前也存在不少困难和问题。其中社会风气不佳，特别引人痛愤。中央提倡社会主义精神文明建设和物质文明建设“一起抓”，同后者相比，我看前者是落后了。
    精神文明建设，包括思想道德建设和教育科学文化建设。思想道德方面的问题，例如不正之风，近来街谈巷议，沸沸扬扬，成为党群关系，政群关系的一个疙瘩。党风、政风、社会风气的消极因素，侵蚀、败坏我们的事业，其势之猛，为新中国建立以来所少见。最近各种新闻载体陆续揭露的“官倒”，是各种不正之风交汇的怪胎。“官倒”之中，肯定有相当比例的共产党员。这些人在违法乱纪、胡作非为的时候，大概把入党誓言忘干净了。“官倒”的基干人物是官员。这些人把国家、人民的血汗装进私囊的时候，大概把“人民公仆”的光荣称号丢进垃圾箱了。“官倒”案中，还有一些“刁钻百姓”，他们或投鱼饵，或充走卒，什么“中国人为人的道德”，大概全不思想了。我同意一种说法，我们的社会主义法制还不健全，因此应当加强法制；也同意一种说法，我们的社会监督很不够，因此应该加强监督。但我觉得，所以出现种种腐败现象，追根到底，主要还是人的素质不高。如果根本不顾是非，或者完全不顾是非，那是什么坏事都干得出来的。哀莫大于心死。那些支持、参与“官倒”的公仆们，有的很可能曾经为人民做过好事，有的甚至可能曾经驰骋疆场，现在却堕落了，变坏了，酿成大时代的小悲剧。
    某种思想、信念主导的社会道德风尚，对当时的社会发展常常产生难以估量的影响。土地革命时期，说起土豪劣绅，红区人人喊打。抗日战争时期，提起汉奸，国人皆曰该杀。解放战争时期，说起蒋军蒋党，爱国人士群起挞伐。新中国建立以后，社会主义改造和社会主义建设，吸引几亿人民你追我赶，个个向上。近十年来，举国一致建设有中国特色的社会主义，而“社会主义精神文明建设是社会主义的重要特征”。牢牢抓紧这件大事，提高人们的思想觉悟和道德水平，共产党员忠于共产主义崇高理想，国家干部克尽“人民公仆”的庄严职责，广大公民以“四有新人”自勉，加上法律约束，群众监督，各种不正之风和丑恶现象就会失掉存在的土壤。这不是可想而不可即的目标，解放以后，就有过这种局面。
    精神文明建设不能代替法制、监督，它的独特的作用也非其他力量所能代替。它是从根本上提高人的素质。古人所说的“慎独”，是高度自觉的精神境界。有这种精神品质，又同广大群众实践相互作用，什么困难艰巨的任务，都不难完满达成。
    近年报刊图书研究、宣扬精神文明的文字，数量不多，质量高的更不多。沙英同志从事理论工作半个世纪，近几年着力研究精神文明问题，在许多方面颇有创见。最近他的《精神文明纵横观》一书出版，如能引发更多的理论结合实际的作品早日涌现，是作者和我、也是关心精神文明建设的同志的希望。
