Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 17th

The flood peak of the Yangtze River, which formed between July 7th and 11th, passed through the Jingjiang section early this morning. The lives and property of the people on both banks are safe and sound.

The 337-kilometer-long Jingjiang section of the Yangtze River is located in the middle reaches of the river, starting from Zhicheng and ending at Chenglingji at the mouth of Dongting Lake. The riverbed is winding and tortuous, making it the most dangerous section of the Yangtze River.

Due to heavy to torrential rain in the Sichuan Basin, the Three Gorges area, and western Hubei, a flood peak formed in the Yangtze River between July 7th and 11th. The floodwaters surged from Shashi towards Jingjiang, causing the water level in the Yangtze River to rise rapidly. The entire Jingjiang section exceeded the warning water level. At 11:00 AM on the 14th, the flood peak reached Shashi, with the water level at 44.20 meters, exceeding the warning water level by 1.2 meters. At 5:00 PM on the 15th, the flood peak reached Jianli, with the water level reaching 36.42 meters, exceeding the warning water level by 2.42 meters.

To overcome this major flood, 200,000 people along the Jingjiang section have been guarding the dikes day and night. Guo Zhenqian, the commander of the Hubei Provincial Flood Control Headquarters and the provincial governor, rushed to the front line of Jingjiang to direct the flood control efforts in person.

After the flood peak passed, the water level in the Jingjiang section remained high. The 200,000 flood control personnel along both banks of the river strengthened the patrols along the dikes to inspect for any potential dangers.

    长江洪峰过荆江
    两岸人财俱无损失
    新华社武汉7月17日电　（通讯员胡碧辉、记者詹仲德）记者从湖北省防汛指挥部获悉，7月7日至11日形成的长江洪峰，今日凌晨通过荆江河段，两岸群众的生命和财产安全无损。
    “万里长江，险在荆江”。全长337公里的荆江河段，位于长江中游，上起枝城，下至洞庭湖口的城陵矶，河道逶迤曲折，是长江最险要河段。
    由于四川盆地和三峡区间、鄂西地区普降大到暴雨，7月7日至11日，长江出现洪峰。洪水从沙市奔腾而下，直逼荆江。长江水位急剧上升，荆江河段全线迅速超过警戒水位。14日11时洪峰到达沙市，沙市水位达44.20米，超过警戒水位1.2米；15日下午5时，洪峰到达监利，监利水位高达36.42米，超出警戒水位2.42米。
    为战胜这次大洪水，荆江沿线有20万人日夜守卫在堤防线上。湖北省防汛指挥部指挥长、省长郭振乾，专程赶到荆江一线，现场指挥抗洪。
    洪峰过后，荆江河段水位仍然很高。沿江两岸20万防汛大军加强了巡堤查险。
