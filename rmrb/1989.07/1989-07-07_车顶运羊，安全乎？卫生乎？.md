    Transporting Sheep on Car Roofs: Safe? Hygienic?

    In the Qianchaqu District of Dejiang County, Guizhou Province, I witnessed something that would seem novel to city dwellers: a driver from a county bus company allowed passengers to tie a flock of live sheep on the roof of the passenger bus, where there is only a few square meters of space for passengers' luggage. Judging by the proficiency of a few young men in tying the sheep, it seemed they had done this many times before, and the driver had never intervened, indicating that this practice was permitted. Of course, farmers transporting sheep are likely doing so for business purposes. This made me think about how to solve the problem of transporting small quantities of agricultural and sideline products in remote and transportation-inconvenient areas. Relevant departments need to think of more solutions. Especially the transportation department, which must both facilitate the public and not violate traffic safety. Transporting sheep on car roofs, regardless of the considerations of the relevant transportation departments, has one thing for sure: it is too unsafe and too unhygienic.

### 车顶运羊，安全乎？卫生乎？

    车顶运羊，安全乎？卫生乎？
    在贵州省德江县前茶区乡，我曾见到这样一件令城市人感到新鲜的事：一个县汽车队跑客运的汽车司机，允许乘客将活羊群拴在客车顶上仅有几平方米放置乘客随行行李的地方。从几个小伙子拴捆羊群的熟练程度看怕是干过多次，也从未受到司机的干预，看来这种行为是允许的。当然农民运羊不外乎是去做生意。由此我想到，在边远山区和交通运输不便的地方，如何解决零星农副产品的外运问题，有关部门需要多想办法。尤其是运输部门，既要方便群众，又不能违反交通安全。车顶运羊，且不论有关运输部门出于何种考虑，但有一条可以肯定：太不安全，太不卫生。
