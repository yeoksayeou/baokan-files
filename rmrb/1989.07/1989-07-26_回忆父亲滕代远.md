Time flies so quickly. It has been 15 years since Father Teng Daoyuan left us. Every time I see his photo or talk with family members about past events, a deep sense of longing for him strikes my heart, making it difficult to calm down.

Father joined the revolution in 1924. From participating in the burgeoning peasant movement in Hunan to organizing and leading the famous "Pingjiang Uprising"; from the anti-"encirclement" struggles on Jinggangshan to the Soviet land revolution; from the tireless work at Wangjiaping in Yan'an to the arduous battles with the enemy in the foothills of the Taihang Mountains; from the establishment and development of the people's railway industry in the early years of the founding of the nation to the ten years of socialist construction, over the decades he was loyal to the Party, loyal to the people, and worked diligently for the people. He endured hardships, connected with the masses, and worked hard, dedicating his life to the liberation of the Chinese people and the cause of communism.

Below, I will recall two small incidents that I personally experienced:

**"Cadres' Children Should Not Seek Special Treatment"**

In 1970, I joined the army and became a soldier in the People's Liberation Army's Railway Corps. Once, due to work needs, the commander ordered me to go to Beijing on a mission. I had not seen Beijing for a long time and was very eager to return, but I also missed my father and mother. When I got home, they were not there; they had gone to other places. Some old classmates who worked in Beijing heard that I had returned and came to visit me, and we had a meal together. Before returning to the unit, I also treated them to a meal at a restaurant. In a letter home, I casually mentioned this to my father. He was very angry upon hearing this and immediately wrote me a letter criticizing the incident. He wrote: "Cadres' children should cultivate a frugal and hardworking spirit. This is not just a matter of living habits, but a matter of ideological awareness, even a matter of political level." After receiving the letter, I was confused and did not understand his criticism, and at the same time, I felt burdened. My father and mother both wrote letters to help me, and they also told my other brothers. They also wrote to the unit leaders. Everyone wrote letters or talked to me, helping me understand where I was wrong. In the following period, I came to realize my mistakes and wrote a report on my thoughts about this incident, sending it to my father and mother who were away. After reading it, they saw that I had recognized my shortcomings and had the resolve to correct them, and they were very happy. My mother wrote a letter saying: "If you truly understand the importance of thrift from now on and put it into practice, we will of course be very happy. Your father wrote a big 'good' on the letter, hoping that you will welcome your 19th birthday with new progress."

**"Family Members Are Not Allowed to Ride My Car"**

Regarding my shortcomings, not every time did I receive my father's understanding. Sometimes when he got angry, it was really enough to make you nervous for half a day.

I remember it was not long after the Party's "Tenth Congress" in 1973. I was participating in a training session at a training team about 30 kilometers away from Beijing. Because the training was intense, it had been a long time since I last visited my father. One Saturday afternoon, after asking for leave from the duty officer, I took two hours on a public bus to return home. Seeing my father, I felt like I had so much to say, from military training to the Party's "Tenth Congress." Time passed quickly, and before I knew it, it was Sunday afternoon. I had to return to the unit before the evening roll call, otherwise, I would violate military discipline. I was very anxious. With no other choice, I had to tell the secretary to use my father's car to send me back. The staff knew my father's temper, but they also sympathized with my situation. After discussing, they decided to have Driver Li send me back to the unit.

In the evening, my father was taking a walk in the courtyard and saw his car leaving. He asked, "Where is the car going?" Driver Li quickly replied, "The fuel is running low, going to refuel." Since this was the first time the car was used for personal matters for me, I had to secretly get into my father's car outside the gate. The "Hongqi" sedan sped along the wide Thirteen Tombs Highway, and in no time, I arrived at the training team's location. After thanking the driver, I ran back to the dormitory.

Little did I know, my father found out about this. He criticized the staff around him, pointing out: the car was allocated by the public for his use, and for personal use, he had to pay for the fuel according to the regulations. How could he let the children ride the car and waste fuel?

The next time I returned home, my father called me aside and asked me how I had returned to the unit last time. I knew something was wrong and had to tell him everything. My father severely criticized me.

Not only that, several of my brothers from the military returning home on leave always took the public bus. Sometimes when they brought a lot of things, they would send a telegram, and I would go to the train station to pick them up. They never used my father's car for personal matters.

**"Father Always Led by Example"**

Not only did he have strict requirements for his children, but my father always led by example. His daily diet was simple, and he liked to eat coarse grains. Eating one small steamed bun every day was his own rule. He never smoked and rarely drank. He required us not to smoke. In his view, smoking was not good for people. In the few years he was on leave, he planted many vegetables and trees in the courtyard and often took us to weed and water them.

My father's clothing was also very simple. Except for a few suits he bought for overseas visits, he always wore cloth clothes at home. He did not want to buy new shirts when they were old, and he would have my mother mend them when his pajamas were torn. When he was seriously ill, the medicines and nutritional supplements he bought were all paid for by himself and were never sent to the public for reimbursement.

Now I deeply feel that my father's actions and words before his passing were not just about strict family education. In fact, he passed on the glorious traditions and fine styles of the Party to us.

    回忆父亲滕代远
    滕久昕
    时间过得真快，转眼间父亲滕代远离开我们已有15个年头了。每当我看到他的照片，或与家里人谈起往事，一种无限缅怀他的心情便撞击着我的胸怀，久久不能平静。
    父亲1924年参加革命，从投身蓬勃兴起的湖南农民运动到组织领导著名的“平江起义”；从井冈山反“围剿”斗争到苏维埃土地革命；从延安王家坪的日夜操劳到太行山麓辗转迂回与敌人战斗；从建国初期创建和发展人民铁道事业到十年社会主义建设，几十年来忠于党，忠于人民，勤勤恳恳地为人民服务，艰苦奋斗，深入实际，联系群众，努力工作，为中国人民的解放事业和共产主义事业贡献了自己的一生。
    以下，我仅回忆两件亲身经历的小事：
              “干部子弟不能搞特殊”
    1970年，我参军来到人民解放军这所大学校，成为一名铁道兵战士。一次，因工作需要，部队首长让我去北京出差。阔别多时的首都北京使我十分向往，但是更想念爸爸、妈妈。回到家一看，他们不在，都到外地去了。一些在京工作的老同学听说我
  回来了，都来找我叙旧，并在一起聚了餐。临返部
  队前，我也在一个饭店回请了他们。在一次家信中，我无意写上告诉了父亲。他知道后非常生气，马上亲笔给我写信，对此事提出了批评。他在信中说：“干部子弟应养成艰苦朴素的作风，吃苦耐劳的习惯。这不是一般生活作风问题，而是思想觉悟问题，甚至是政治水平高低的问题。”我收到信后，思想一时不通，对他的批评不理解，同时也背上了思想包袱。父亲、母亲都及时写信帮助我，并告诉其他几个哥哥，同时也写信告诉了部队领导。大家都来信，或者找我谈话，帮我认识这个问题错在哪里。在以后一个时期，我对自己错误的言行有了认识，并把这件事前后的态度写成一份思想汇报，寄给了在外地的父亲和母亲。他们看后，见我认识到缺点，并有了改正的决心，都很高兴。母亲写来信说：“如果真正从此知道节约的重要性，并落实到行动上，我们当然很高兴。……你爸在信上批了一个很大的‘好’字，希望你以新的进步迎接19岁生日的来到。”
          “家里人不许坐我的车”
    对于我的缺点，并不是每次都能得到父亲的谅解。有时他发起脾气来，还真够你紧张半天。
    记得那是在1973年党的“十大”开过不久，我在离北京市区约30公里远的地方参加教导队集训。因为训练紧张，已有很久没回去看父亲了。一个星期六的下午，我向值班员请假后，坐了两个小时的公共汽车，回到家里。见到父亲后总觉得有说不完的话，从军事训练谈到党的“十大”会议。时间过得很快，一晃就到星期天下午了。我必须要在晚饭点名之前归队，否则就违犯了军纪。我心里非常着急。万般无奈，只得向秘书讲，用父亲的汽车送我一趟。工作人员知道父亲的脾气，可又同情我的难处。他们商量后，决定请司机李师傅开车送我归队。
    傍晚，父亲正在院里散步，见自己的汽车出库，就问：“车子去哪里？”李师傅忙说：“油不多了，去加点油。”由于这是第一次因私事为我派车用，只好偷偷在大门外上了父亲的汽车。“红旗”牌轿车在宽阔的十三陵公路上风驰电掣，没一会儿，就到了教导队驻地。下车谢过司机同志，一路小跑返回宿舍。
    哪知道，这件事还是让父亲给问出来了。他批评了身边工作人员。指出：车子是公家配备给他使用的，私事用车还要按规定交汽油费，哪能让小孩子随便坐车，浪费汽油。
    以后的一次回家时，父亲把我单独叫到一边，询问上次是怎样归队的。我知道事情不妙，只得一五一十讲出来。父亲严厉地批评我。
    不仅如此，几个哥哥从部队探亲回家，从来都是自己乘公共汽车回家。有时带东西多，打来电报，也是让我去火车站接。没有因私事坐过父亲的汽车。
              父亲总是以身作则
    不仅对孩子要求严格，父亲自己总是以身作则。他平时伙食很简单，喜欢吃一些粗粮。每天一个小窝头也是他自己订的规矩。他从不抽烟，也很少喝酒。他要求我们不要抽烟。在他看来，吸烟对人没有什么好处。在离职休息的几年里，还在院子里种了许多菜和树，有空就带我们锄草、浇水。
    父亲衣着也很简朴。除去为出国访问而置的几套衣服外，平时在家总是穿布衣服。衬衣旧了不愿买新的，睡衣破了就让母亲补一补。他身患重病时，购买的一些药品和营养品，都是自己出钱，从不拿去让公家报销。
    现在我深感到，父亲生前的所做所为，不仅仅是个家教严的问题，实际上是把党的光荣传统和优良作风传授给我们。
