From May 31 to June 3, the social science associations of the seven provinces and autonomous regions along the Yellow River held a joint seminar in Qingdao to discuss the economic and social development of the provinces and regions along the Yellow River. The seminar focused on three main issues.

Advantages and Disadvantages of Economic Cooperation in the Yellow River Basin

Participants noted that the seven provinces and regions along the Yellow River have significant potential and advantages for economic development. Firstly, the region is rich in resources. The Yellow River basin is abundant in hydropower, coal, oil, gas, and over a hundred types of minerals, with several types having the largest reserves in the country. Ancient capitals like Xi'an, Luoyang, and Kaifeng, along with numerous scenic spots, provide excellent conditions for the development of the tourism industry. However, due to limitations in funding and technology, these valuable resources have not been fully utilized. Through cooperation among the provinces and regions, expanding investment, and adopting joint ventures, partnerships, and cooperative business models, these resource advantages can be rapidly and fully leveraged to provide a solid foundation for economic development. Secondly, the region has superior agricultural and pastoral conditions. The Yellow River basin has a diverse landscape, with a significant position in grain, oil, and cotton cultivation, and a developed livestock industry. However, agricultural and pastoral development is unbalanced, with poor coordination between upstream and downstream regions, and low labor productivity and commodity rates. Through joint development of agriculture and pastoralism, not only can the market for agricultural and pastoral products be expanded, but also the internal structure of agriculture and pastoralism can be optimized, and the application of scientific and technological advancements can be promoted. Thirdly, the provinces at the mouth of the Yellow River have numerous excellent ports, facilitating the development of import and export trade. Fourthly, industrial cities are densely populated, with strong economic radiation capabilities. These cities have the ability to coordinate economic operations and drive the development of surrounding regions, thereby promoting the overall economic development of the basin.

Some participants pointed out that in developing economic cooperation along the Yellow River, it is necessary to pay attention to the differences in economic development among the provinces and regions. Fiscal "separate kitchens," regional self-protection consciousness, and the inherent self-sealing consciousness of "Yellow River culture" constrain mutual openness and cooperation. These issues should be given full attention and efforts should be made to turn disadvantages into advantages.

Strengthening the Strategic Research on the Development of the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Belt

Participants proposed that the overall favorable conditions for the economic development of the provinces and regions along the Yellow River are numerous, but each province and region has its own strengths and weaknesses. Only through strengthened cooperation and unity can the advantages be fully utilized, and a reasonable economic structure be formed.

Participants suggested that the economic strategy of the Yellow River basin should be studied from a macro perspective. (1) The governance of the ecological environment should be placed at the strategic height of development. In modern times, the reduction of forest vegetation in the upper reaches of the Yellow River has led to severe soil erosion, and the lower reaches have frequently suffered from floods and water shortages. Not only has the natural ecosystem that traditional agricultural civilization relies on become increasingly imbalanced, but it has also hindered the better development of industrial civilization. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the concept of integrating economy, society, and ecology, giving equal importance to environmental governance and economic development, and organically combining water and soil conservation, rational resource development, and ecological system balance. (2) Accelerate horizontal economic links and cooperation. The Yellow River Economic Cooperation Belt is a belt-shaped regional economy with the Yellow River as the link, connecting the four major economic regions of Northwest, Southwest, North China, and Central South, with many common problems such as the development of hydropower, transportation, and the layout of key industries, which should be studied from the perspective of the overall economic strategy of the basin, and coordinated with each other to achieve good macro benefits. The development of the basin economy should break through regional boundaries and establish and improve the market system and operating mechanism of commodity economy. (3) Adjust regional economic policies. Each province and region should, based on the principle of comparative economic advantages and industrial and regional division of labor, negotiate economic mutual benefit policies for the entire basin. (4) Formulate necessary resource compensation policies. Each province and region should include the rational development and utilization of resources, as well as effective compensation, in their agenda, and study and formulate reasonable resource compensation systems and equivalent exchange policies.

Levels of Development in the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Belt

Participants believed that the emergence of the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Belt is in line with the objective laws of the development of commodity economy, and it has vigorous vitality and a very bright future. However, cooperation is just beginning, and the economic strength of each province and region is relatively weak. From the perspective of the actual conditions and internal potential of the cooperation belt itself, the cooperation and unity of the provinces and regions can be carried out in a step-by-step manner, from small to large, from near to far, and from point to surface. The first level is to take circulation and transportation as the breakthrough point for cooperation, through commodity exchange, material exchange, foreign trade joint ventures or agency operations, transportation joint ventures, and tourism cooperation, to establish regular and stable contacts between the provinces and regions, and initially form an economic relationship of mutual interest. The second level is to gradually develop cooperation towards the production field. Based on the resource advantages of each province and region, on the basis of mutual benefit, promote the rational flow of funds, technology, and talent, organize large and medium-sized enterprise groups or joint-stock, cooperative, and joint-venture enterprises across regions and departments, jointly develop resources, conduct deep processing, form leading products, and drive the development of small and medium-sized enterprises, township enterprises, and the tertiary industry. The third level is to take the large and medium-sized cities within the cooperation belt as the support, establish a common market for consumer goods, production materials, technology, finance, and services, adopt coordinated macro-control measures, formulate transaction rules that each province and region should jointly abide by, and expand cooperation with other economic cooperation zones in the country. The above three levels are interrelated and interdependent. Short-term cooperation should focus on the first and second levels. Only on the basis of highly socialized, commoditized, and modernized production, multi-channel, orderly, and open circulation, and gradually narrowing the gap between the east and the west, can a common market for the Yellow River Economic Cooperation Belt be established.

    沿黄省区经济社会发展理论研讨会综述
    今年5月31日至6月3日，沿黄七省、自治区社会科学联合会在青岛市联合召开沿黄省、区经济社会发展理论研讨会，着重讨论了以下三个方面的问题。
    沿黄流域经济协作发展的优势及劣势
    与会同志认为，沿黄7省、区经济发展的潜力和优势很大。首先，资源丰富。黄河流域有着丰富的水力、煤炭、油气和上百种矿产资源，其中有数十种品类储量占全国之首。西安、洛阳、开封等古都以及大量的风景胜地为繁荣和发展旅游事业提供了优厚的条件。但由于资金和技术等条件的限制，这些宝贵资源尚未得到很好的利用。通过各省、区的协作，扩大投资，以参股、联营、合作等经营方式，可以迅速充分地发挥资源优势，为经济发展提供坚实的基础。其次，农牧业条件优越。黄河流域地貌复杂多样，以粮、油、棉为中心的种植业地位重要，畜牧业较发达。但农牧业发展不平衡，流域上游协调结合不够，劳动生产率、商品率较低，通过联合发展农牧业，不仅可以扩大农牧产品的销售市场，而且可以推动农牧业内部结构的优化和科学技术的推广应用。再次，黄河入海口省份有众多的良港，便于进出口贸易的发展。第四，工业城市密集，经济辐射能力强。这些城市具有协调经济运行、带动周围地区经济发展的能力，带动整个流域经济的发展。
    有的同志提出，发展沿黄经济协作必须注意到各省、区经济发展的差异。财政“分灶吃饭”，地区自我保护意识，“黄河文化”所固有的自我封闭意识，制约着相互开放和协作。这些都应给予充分重视，并设法变不利为有利。
    加强沿黄经济协作带发展战略研究沿黄省、区经济总体有利条件很多，然而具体到每个省、区又各有长短。各省、区之间只有加强协作与联合，才能更好地扬长避短，形成合理的经济结构。
    与会同志提出，应从全局的高度对沿黄流域的经济战略进行认真研究。（1）生态环境的治理应置于发展战略的高度。近代以来，黄河上游地带的林木植被减少，水土流失严重，下游地带屡遭洪患与缺水之害，不仅传统的农业文明赖以依存的自然生态系统日渐失衡，而且滞缓了工业文明的更好发展。因此，必须树立经济、社会、生态三位一体，治理环境与开发经济并重、同步的观念，把水土保持、资源合理开发与生态系统平衡有机结合起来。（2）加快横向经济联系和协作。沿黄经济协作带是以黄河为纽带的带状区域经济，它联结西北、西南、华北、中南四大经济区，有许多共同性的问题，如水电的开发、交通运输的发展、重点产业的布局等，都应从全流域的经济战略角度加以研究，相互协调，才能收到良好的宏观效益。流域经济的发展，要打破地域界限，建立健全商品经济的市场体系及运行机制。（3）调整区域经济政策。各省、区应该依据比较经济优势和产业分工、区域分工的原则，协商全流域的经济互惠政策。（4）制定必要的资源补偿政策。各省、区应将资源的合理开发与利用以及有效补偿等问题列入议事日程，研究制定合理的资源补偿制度和等价交换政策。
    沿黄经济协作带发展的层次
    与会同志认为，沿黄经济协作带的产生，顺应了商品经济发展的客观规律，它具有蓬勃旺盛的生命力和极为光明的前景。但目前协作刚刚起步，各省、区经济实力较弱，从协作带本身具有的现实条件和内部潜力看，各省、区的协作联合可由小到大、由近到远、由片到面地分层次展开。第一层次，以流通和交通作为协作的突破口，通过商品交流、物资串换、外贸联营或代营、交通运输联营、旅游合作等协作联合形式，使各省、区建立经常、稳定的联系，初步形成利益相关的经济关系。第二层次，联合逐渐向生产领域发展。根据各省、区的资源优势，在互惠互利的基础上，促进资金、技术、人才的合理流动，组织跨地区、跨部门的大、中型企业集团或参股、合股、联营企业，共同开发资源，联合进行深加工，形成拳头产品，并带动中小企业、乡镇企业及第三产业的发展。第三层次，以协作带内大、中城市为依托，建立消费品、生产资料、科技、金融、劳务等共同市场，采取相互协调的宏观调控手段，制定各省、区共同遵守的交易规则，扩大与全国其他经济协作区的合作。以上三个层次相互联系、相互依存。近期协作应以第一、二层次为主要内容。只有在生产高度社会化、商品化、现代化，流通实现多渠道化、有序化、开放化，东西部差距逐渐缩小的基础上，才可能建立沿黄省、区经济协作带共同市场。
