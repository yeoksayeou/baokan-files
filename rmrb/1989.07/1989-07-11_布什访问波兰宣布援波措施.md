Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 11th.

U.S. President Bush, who is visiting Poland, announced on July 10th several measures to aid Poland.

Bush made the announcement while addressing the Polish Parliament. The measures include: requesting Congress to approve a $100 million loan to Poland to support private enterprises, and urging other Western partners at the upcoming economic summit in Paris this weekend to provide similar funds; providing a $325 million loan to Poland through the World Bank to help improve agricultural and industrial production; urging Western creditor nations to negotiate with Poland to convert short-term loans into long-term loans; requesting Congress to approve a $15 million loan to help the Krakow region address water and air pollution; and agreeing to establish a U.S. Cultural Information Center in Warsaw, while suggesting that Poland establish a similar center in Washington.

In the afternoon of the 10th, Bush held talks with Polish leader Jaruzelski.

Yesterday, Polish Foreign Minister Orzechowski and U.S. Secretary of State Baker signed an agreement to convert two short-term loans owed by Poland to the U.S. into long-term loans.

Bush also delivered a speech in the Polish Parliament. When discussing East-West relations, he pointed out that the fundamental way to change East-West relations is to significantly reduce conventional weapons and troops in Europe. He hopes that the Vienna arms control talks will make real progress.

    布什访问波兰宣布援波措施
    本报柏林7月11日电　记者许宏治报道：正在波兰访问的美国总统布什7月10日宣布了美国对波兰提供援助的一些措施。
    布什是在波兰议会发表讲话时宣布这些措施的。这些措施包括：请求国会批准向波兰提供1亿美元贷款，作为支持波兰私营企业的基金，并在本周末在巴黎召开的工业国家经济高级会议上要求其他西方伙伴也提供类似基金；通过世界银行向波兰提供3.25亿美元贷款，以帮助波兰提高工农业生产；呼吁西方债权国与波兰协商，大幅度地将短期贷款改为长期贷款；请求国会同意提供1500万美元贷款，用于帮助克拉科夫地区治理水域、大气污染；同意在华沙建立美国文化信息中心，并建议波兰在华盛顿也建立这样的中心。
    10日下午，波兰领导人雅鲁泽尔斯基同他进行了会谈。
    昨天，波兰外长奥热霍夫斯基和美国国务卿贝克在一项短期贷款改为长期贷款的协定上签了字。该协定涉及波兰欠美国的两笔短期贷款。
    布什昨天还在波兰议会发表演说。在谈到东西方关系时他指出，彻底改变东西方关系的办法是在欧洲大幅度裁减常规武器和部队。他希望维也纳裁军会议取得真正进展。
