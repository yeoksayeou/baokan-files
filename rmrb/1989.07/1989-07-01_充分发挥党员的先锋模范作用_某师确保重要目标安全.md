The Beijing Garrison's certain regiment fully exerted the vanguard and exemplary role of Communist Party members. During the execution of martial law in the capital, they remained fearless in the face of danger and calm in the face of chaos, safeguarding the security of key targets in the capital.

Since mid-April, when the capital was in turmoil, over 4,000 Communist Party members in the entire regiment demonstrated a firm stance and a spirit of self-sacrifice. The regiment commander, Qin Tao, and the political commissar, Hao Gongcheng, led by example, guiding the entire regiment to resolutely carry out the orders of the Central Military Commission. On the morning of the day the "Asian Development Bank" meeting was held, some misinformed masses and students attempted to storm the Great Hall of the People four times. In this critical moment, the chief of staff, Li Runhe, and the political department director, Sheng Zhaoming, led cadres and party member shock troops to appear before the provocateurs. They formed 15 human walls with their bodies, blocking all entrances to the Great Hall.

To ensure the absolute safety of key targets such as the capital's aviation, railways, broadcasting, and television communication hubs, a certain regiment established day and night patrol teams consisting of over a hundred party member cadres. They meticulously laid out defenses inside and outside the targets. Some party members went without rest for days on end, while others were injured by rioters while rescuing comrades.

Due to the effective exertion of the vanguard and exemplary role of Communist Party members, this unit fought continuously for over 60 days and nights without losing a single person, vehicle, gun, or bullet. The important targets they guarded remained unharmed, earning praise from higher-ranking officials.

    充分发挥党员的先锋模范作用
    某师确保重要目标安全
    本报讯　北京卫戍区某师充分发挥共产党员的先锋模范作用，在首都执行戒严任务时临危不惧，临险不乱，保卫了首都重点目标的安全。
    4月中旬首都发生动乱以来，全师4000多名共产党员表现出了坚定的立场和献身精神。师长秦涛、政委郝功成身先士卒，带领全师坚决执行中央军委命令。“亚行”会议召开的当天上午，一些不明真相的群众和学生先后4次冲击人民大会堂。在万分危急关头，参谋长李润和、政治部主任盛兆明分别带领干部和党员突击队出现在挑衅者面前，他们用身躯先后组成15道人墙，封锁大会堂各个通口。
    为了确保首都航空、铁路、广播、电视通信枢纽等重要目标的绝对安全，某团建立了以上百名党员干部为主体的昼夜巡逻队，对目标内外进行细致布防，有的党员连续几天几夜得不到休息，有的为救护战友被暴徒打伤。
    由于共产党员的先锋模范作用得到了较好发挥，这个部队连续奋战60多个日夜，没丢一人一车、一枪一弹，所警卫的一批重要目标安然无恙，因此受到上级首长的赞扬。
