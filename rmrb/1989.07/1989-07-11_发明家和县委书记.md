The young man is shy and bashful, speaking softly, his name is Zhao Yaorong, a youth from Zhao Jia Village in Hebei Township, Yuxian County, Shanxi Province. He is known as the "Young Inventor." His hometown is by the muddy Zhaochang River, with vast expanses of saline-alkali flats that do not grow crops, shrubs, or weeds, but are covered with reeds. Since childhood, Yaorong has been fond of tinkering with things. He thought, why not crossbreed the reeds growing on the saline-alkali flats with corn? This way, the vast areas of unproductive land could be utilized. He went to the county library to study books on corn hybridization, taking thick notes; he went to the Institute of Genetics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing to seek guidance, explaining his ideas in detail; he paid his own way to the Maize Research Institute of Shanxi Agricultural Academy, studying under Professor Niu Tianchang, diligently mastering the knowledge of breeding. Finally, with the help of experts like Niu Tianchang and Li Zongxian, the crossbreeding of corn and reed was successful. He wrote a paper titled "Research on the Mechanism of Distant Hybridization between Corn and Reed." His invention shocked the village and caught the attention of experts, earning him the second prize for major scientific research achievements in Shanxi Province. To promote this achievement as soon as possible, Zhao Yaorong went to Hainan Island to conduct further breeding of the hybrid variety.

A village boy suddenly becomes famous, rumors and gossip follow

Zhao Yaorong, a village boy, became a news figure, an inventor. In the past decade, he has had 49 inventions and research achievements, with 8 of them obtaining national patents. He was selected as a National New Long March Pioneer and a model for learning and applying science. However, fame and honor also brought him various troubles and worries. Some people first criticized his inventions, saying, "A blind cat catching a dead mouse," "His cultural level is too low, the invention was helped by others"; others said he was "faking it," "stealing others' achievements," and even spreading rumors to slander him. Zhao Yaorong was surrounded by gossip and truly felt overwhelmed.

The Yuxian County Committee and County Government learned of these situations. County Magistrate Lei Ming visited Zhao Jia Village to see him and said, "Little Zhao, no matter what others say, the path you have chosen, you must walk firmly! The government supports you." The county government also broke the rules to recruit him as a staff member of the county science and technology commission. The commission is a different environment. There are many experts and technical personnel. Zhao Yaorong studied knowledge voraciously. He used an old telephone to make a small generator, using it to light up while breeding in Hainan Island, and read books on biology, genetics, and breeding in the low, humid shed. New troubles came his way. The unit's leader found him, asking him to admit that his "corn and reed hybridization" invention was done jointly with a technician from the Agriculture Bureau, and said, "As long as you provide a statement, that technician can handle the transfer of his agricultural household registration." Zhao Yaorong said, "I dare not do this, nor can I do this, this is faking." The leader said, "You decide." After that, there were occasional rumors, some of which were quite hurtful.

"Zhao Yaorong doesn't go to work, he's a special person, he has achieved something."
"Who can lead him, he's a national figure."
"Haven't seen much of the world, and already so arrogant."

Little Zhao silently listened to these cold words, and his desire to invent gradually cooled down. He turned to rural poverty alleviation and family planning work. When he was very troubled, the secretary of the Yuxian County Committee, Li Xing, invited him to talk three times. Li Xing told him, "People with abilities and talents always face criticism and slander. No matter what others say, you must have firm confidence and keep going. The county committee will support you!" Li Xing also notified the county radio station to broadcast Zhao Yaorong's inventions and the economic benefits of promoting his inventions.

One day, Professor Zhang Jingrong from Sichuan Light Industry University came to Yuxian County, specifically to discuss the purchase of Zhao Yaorong's "dryland loach farming" technology patent. After inspection, listening to the introduction, and reviewing relevant materials, the old professor determined that Zhao Yaorong's invention was reasonable, applicable, and economical. He immediately decided: willing to pay 200,000 yuan as the patent transfer fee to purchase this patent. However, the problem was that Little Zhao was a staff member of the county science and technology commission, and his inventions were done in his spare time, so the unit had to act on his behalf to handle the matter. Zhao Yaorong told the unit leader, "I will hand over my invention to the unit for free, I don't want any money, let the unit negotiate with them." The unit leader said, "This might not be good, you have so many inventions, if you all do this, it might bring more jealousy and more trouble. It's better not to do this." As a result, the negotiation failed, and the old professor had to return to Sichuan.

The county committee secretary said, no matter how many inventions you have, don't worry

After learning of Zhao Yaorong's new difficulties, County Committee Secretary Li Xing strongly advocated for the establishment of a "Star Fire Technology Research Institute" in the county, absorbing Zhao Yaorong's inventions and creations, as well as those of others, for research, development, and promotion. He told Zhao Yaorong, "No matter how big or how many inventions you have, don't worry, your inventions should first bloom and bear fruit on this land of Yuxian!" Little Zhao's eyes welled up with tears, saying, "Secretary Li, rest assured, I will continue to work!" In 1988, Zhao Yaorong invented "Cold and Warm Wind Sun Hat," "Multifunctional Plastic Greenhouse and Solar Warm Bed," and "Water-Assisted Combustion Civil Stove," all of which obtained national patents and have signed production contracts with 4 enterprises.

Zhao Yaorong firmly walks his own path. He is only 29 years old, with deep wrinkles on his face. He said, "To be honest, it's really hard to accomplish something now! Secretary Li of the county committee supports me so much, no matter how many difficulties there are, I have to keep going. I always want to dedicate my intelligence to the land and people who raised me."

    发明家和县委书记
    本报记者　王艾生
    腼腆，羞涩，说话慢声细语，他，叫赵耀荣，山西省榆社县郝北乡赵家村青年，被人们誉为“青年发明家”。他的家乡在浊漳河岸，有大片大片的盐碱滩，不长庄稼，不长灌木，不长杂草，却长了很多蒲草。耀荣从小就爱琢磨事，他就想把长在盐碱滩上的蒲草和玉米杂交，这样，大片不长庄稼的盐碱滩不是可以利用了吗？他跑到县城图书馆啃读有关玉米杂交的书，作了厚厚的笔记；他到北京中国科学院遗传研究所拜师，不厌其详地说出自己的想法；他自费来到山西农科院高粱研究所，拜牛天堂为老师，苦苦掌握育种的知识。终于，在牛天堂、李宗贤等专家的帮助下，玉米和香蒲杂交成功，他写出论文《玉米与香蒲远缘杂交及其机理的研究》。他的发明成果震动了山村，也引起专家们的注意，捧回山西省重大科研成果二等奖。为了使这一成果早日推广，赵耀荣又奔赴海南岛，进行杂交品种的加代繁殖。
    一个农村娃娃一举成名，风言风语接踵而至
    赵耀荣，一个农村娃娃，成了新闻人物，成了发明家。近十年来，他有49项发明和研究成果问世，有8项获国家专利。他被选为全国新长征突击手、学科学用科学标兵。但是，名声和荣誉也招来了种种麻烦、苦恼。有的人先是对他的发明横挑鼻子竖挑眼，说“瞎猫碰上死老鼠”，“他文化程度太低，发明是别人帮助搞的”；还有人说他是“以假充真”，“偷了别人的成果”，甚至造谣中伤他。赵耀荣被七嘴八舌所包围，真有点顶不住了。
    榆社县委、县政府得知这些情况，县长雷鸣到赵家村看望他，并说：“小赵，不管别人怎么说，自己选准的路子，要坚定地走下去！政府支持你。”县政府还破格录用他为县科委干部。科委是另一种环境。专家、技术人员很多，赵耀荣如饥似渴学习知识。他利用一台旧电话机制成一台小发电机，在海南岛育种时利用它照明，在低矮潮湿的棚子里读完生物、遗传、育种等专著。新的烦恼又向他袭击。单位的负责人找他，让他承认他的“玉米与香蒲杂交”发明是同农业局的一位技术员合搞的，并说：“只要你出个证明，那个技术员就可以办理农转非户口。”赵耀荣说：“我不敢这样办，也不能这样办，这是弄假。”那位负责人说：“你看着办吧。”这以后，不时有风言风语吹来，有的很刺耳。
    “人家赵耀荣不上班，特殊人物，有功啦。”
    “谁能领导了人家，全国人物嘛。”
    “还没见几天世面，气就粗了。”
    小赵默默地听着这些风凉话，他的发明欲望也渐渐冷却，转而下乡扶贫、搞计划生育工作。在他十分苦恼的时候，榆社县委书记李兴三次约他去谈心。李兴对他说：“有本事的人，有能耐的人，总免不了遭到别人的责难和非议。不管别人说什么，你要坚定信心，走下去。县委给你撑腰！”李兴并通知县广播站，要播放赵耀荣的发明创造，播放推广赵耀荣发明取得的经济效益。
    一天，四川轻工学院曾敬容教授来到榆社县，专程来洽谈购买赵耀荣发明的“旱地养泥鳅”技术专利。老教授经过察看，又听介绍，查阅有关资料，认定赵耀荣的这项发明合理、适用、经济，当场敲定：愿出20万元作为专利转让费，购买这项专利。但问题是，小赵是县科委干部，他的发明是业余搞的，必须由单位出面才能办理。赵耀荣对单位领导说：“我把我的发明无偿交给单位，我一个钱也不要，由单位同人家洽谈。”“我只想尽快把这项发明变成生产力，推广出去！”单位领导说：“这样怕不好吧，你有那么多发明，都这样搞，可能会招来更多的嫉妒，招来更多的麻烦。还是不要这样办。”结果，洽谈不成，老教授只好返回四川。
    县委书记说，你有再多的发明也不要愁
    县委书记李兴得知赵耀荣这些新的难题后，力主在县里成立一个“星火技术研究所”，吸收赵耀荣的发明创造，吸收其它人的发明创造，进行研究开发和推广。他对赵耀荣说：“你有再大再多的发明也不要愁，你的发明，要先在榆社这块土地上开花结果！”小赵双眼含着泪水，说：“李书记，你放心，我会干下去！”1988年赵耀荣又连续发明了“冷暖风太阳帽”、“多功能塑料大棚及温床太阳能”、“水助燃民用炉”等，都获国家专利，已同4家企业签订生产合同。
    赵耀荣坚定地走自己的路。他刚29岁，脸上有深深皱纹。他说：“说实话，现在干成一件事确实太难！县委李书记那样支持我，困难再多，也得干。我总想把我的智力献给养育我的土地，养育我的人民。”
