Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 24th

General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, emphasized during his inspection in Hubei that all levels of party and government leaders and Party members should uphold the Party's glorious traditions, organize and lead the masses, share hardships and fight together, and ensure the safety of production and people's lives and property in the flood control work along the Yangtze River. This is to implement in practical actions the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, do good things for the people, and benefit the people.

From July 21 to 24, Jiang Zemin, accompanied by Hubei Provincial Party Secretary Guan Guangfu, Minister of Water Resources Yang Zhenhuai, and Minister of Agriculture He Kang, inspected the Yangtze River Jianjiang flood control embankment, Jianjiang diversion project, Gezhouba Dam, and Hankou flood control embankment. He listened to reports from Hubei Province and responsible comrades from Yichang City, Yichang Region, Shashi City, Jingzhou Region, and the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office on the flood control work in the previous period and put forward requirements for future flood control work.

From July 7 to 11, 86 counties in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in Sichuan experienced 200 to 300 millimeters of rain, with some areas reaching 505 millimeters. Western Hubei and Yichang Region experienced heavy rains of 100 to 300 millimeters, while the Han River Basin above Xiangyang experienced 100 to 230 millimeters of rain. This prolonged heavy rain, covering a wide area and with high intensity, moved from west to east consistent with the river's direction, causing the fifth-largest flood since the founding of the People's Republic in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, particularly in the Jianjiang section. The Central Committee and the State Council attached great importance to flood control work. The Hubei Provincial Party Committee and government also prioritized flood control and emergency mobilization of 360,000 military and civilian personnel to ensure flood control safety. Jiang Zemin praised the achievements of this Yangtze River flood control battle and expressed his gratitude to the more than 100 million people, cadres at all levels, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who have been fighting on the front lines of flood control along the Yangtze River. He pointed out that during the water receding period, special attention should be paid to preventing and guarding against bank collapses. He hoped that everyone would maintain a high level of vigilance and morale throughout the flood season, continue to strive, and be ready to defend against any new flood peaks.

While inspecting the Jianjiang embankment and Jianjiang diversion project, Jiang Zemin asked the responsible comrades in Shashi and Jianjiang Region in detail about the embankment's protection, the construction of flood control facilities in the diversion area, and the historical floods and disasters. Jiang Zemin said, "The 10,000-li Yangtze River is dangerous at Jianjiang." This time, I came to inspect the flood control work here. Although the flood peak of the Yangtze River has safely passed, the flood season has not yet ended. Late July and August are the peak flood season for the Yangtze River, and Sichuan may still experience heavy rains, which could bring a large flood from the Sichuan River. We must not be complacent about flood control. Cadres at all levels and Party members must play a pioneering and exemplary role, organizing and leading the masses, working together with the people, and ensuring that the flood control work throughout the flood season is well done.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that flood control requires preparedness. We must strengthen the reinforcement and protection of the Jianjiang embankment, accelerate the construction of flood control facilities in the diversion area, and enhance meteorological and hydrological forecasting and reporting along the Yangtze River. We must ensure that hydrological information is transmitted smoothly, timely, and accurately, and establish a sound flood control communication and liaison system.

At Gezhouba Dam, Jiang Zemin visited the staff of the Gezhouba Engineering Bureau, Gezhouba Power Plant, and the ship lock. Jiang Zemin said, "The construction of water conservancy projects is very arduous. The Party and the people will never forget the hard work of the Gezhouba project builders." He emphasized the importance of developing the economy by first developing energy. He hoped that the staff of Gezhouba Power Plant would uphold the spirit of the working class as masters of the country, generate more electricity, and contribute more to the country's construction.

Jiang Zemin also showed great concern for Hubei's agricultural situation this year. He fully affirmed the efforts of Hubei's leaders and the masses at all levels to ensure a bumper harvest this year. He said, "Feeding 1.1 billion people is a major issue. Comrades at the central and local levels must firmly establish the idea of taking agriculture as the foundation and seriously grasp agricultural production and construction." He emphasized the importance of having grain in hand to ensure stability. With grain, many things become easier. He pointed out that China has a large population but limited arable land, so every inch of land must be cherished. Agricultural investment should be increased, and scientific and technological training and education should be emphasized to improve farmers' quality. A sound agricultural service system should be established, and efforts should be made to strengthen seed breeding, agricultural water conservancy, agricultural machinery, and agricultural industrial construction. Regions with conditions should give full play to the advantages of moderate-scale agricultural operations. He noted that the rain area is moving northward, and various places in the Yangtze River Basin should pay attention to drought prevention and control, ensuring both flood control and drought prevention. He required cadres at all levels to help farmers solve difficulties, do their best to meet farmers' needs for production materials, and do a good job in the procurement of agricultural and sideline products. He called for the full mobilization of farmers' enthusiasm and the joint efforts of all levels to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest this year.

During this period, Jiang Zemin also listened to the report from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee on the implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. He met with responsible comrades from the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial Military Region, and Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. He also inspected Wuhan Iron and Steel Company, the Yangtze River Basin Planning Office, and the Yangtze River Scientific Academy.

    江泽民视察湖北抗洪工作
    要求各级干部广大党员带领群众共同奋战
    以实际行动贯彻四中全会精神造福于人民
    新华社武汉7月24日电  （记者陈乃进）中共中央总书记江泽民在湖北视察时指出：各级党政领导同志和共产党员，要发扬党的光荣传统，组织和带领广大群众，同甘共苦，共同战斗，切实做好长江沿岸防汛抗洪工作，保证城乡广大人民群众的生产和生命财产安全，以实际行动贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，为人民办好事，造福于民。
    7月21日到24日，江泽民同志在湖北省委书记关广富、水利部长杨振怀、农业部长何康的陪同下，视察了长江荆江防洪大堤、荆江分洪工程、葛洲坝和汉口防洪大堤，听取了湖北省以及湖北省宜昌市、宜昌地区、沙市市、荆州地区和长江流域规划办公室负责同志关于前段防汛抗洪工作的情况汇报，对今后的防汛抗洪工作提出了要求。
    7月7日至11日，长江上游的川东地区共86个县降雨200到300毫米，少数地区达到505毫米。湖北鄂西、宜昌地区大都降了100至300毫米的暴雨，汉水流域襄阳以上大部分地区降雨量都在100至230毫米之间。这次大雨到暴雨，持续时间长，范围广，强度大，雨区移动自西向东与河流走向一致，使长江中游的荆江河段出现了建国以来的第五位大洪水。党中央、国务院对防汛工作十分重视，湖北省委、省政府也把防汛抗洪作为当前工作的重点，紧急动员36万军民上堤防汛抢险，千方百计确保了防洪的安全。江泽民同志肯定了这次长江抗洪斗争的成绩，并对日夜奋战在长江沿岸防汛抗洪第一线的六省上百万群众、各级干部和中国人民解放军指战员表示慰问。他指出，在退水期间，特别要警惕和防止坍岸出险；他希望大家在整个汛期都要保持高度警惕和高昂的斗志，再接再厉，随时准备抗御可能出现的新的洪峰。
    在观察荆江大堤和荆江分洪工程时，江泽民同志向沙市和荆江地区的负责同志详细询问了大堤的防护、分洪区防洪安全设施的建设及历史上的洪水和灾害情况。江泽民说，“万里长江，险在荆江”。我这次就是来检查这里的防汛抗洪工作。长江干流的这次洪峰虽已安全通过，但汛期并没有过去，7月下旬8月份正是长江大汛期，四川还可能降暴雨，川江还可能来大洪水。对防汛抗洪千万不能麻痹。各级干部和广大共产党员，一定要发挥先锋模范作用，组织群众，带领群众，同广大人民群众齐心协力，把整个汛期的防汛抗洪工作搞好。
    江泽民指出，防汛抗洪，有备无患。要做好荆江大堤的加固防护，加快分洪区的防洪安全设施建设，还要加强长江沿岸气象水文预测预报，健全防洪通讯联络系统，做到水文信息传递畅通、及时、准确。
    在葛洲坝，江泽民同志看望了葛洲坝工程局、葛洲坝电厂和船闸的干部职工。江泽民说，水利工程施工相当艰苦，党和人民决不会忘记葛洲坝工程建设者们的艰苦劳动。发展经济，首先要开发能源。希望葛洲坝电厂的广大职工发扬工人阶级主人翁精神，为国家建设多发电，多贡献。
    江泽民同志还十分关心湖北今年的农业情况。他充分肯定湖北各级领导、广大干部群众为夺取今年丰收所做的大量工作。他说，全国11亿人口，吃饭是一个重大问题。中央和地方的同志都要牢固树立以农业为基础的观念，认真抓好农业生产和农业建设。“手中有粮，心中不慌”。有了粮食，许多事情就好办了。他说，我国人口多耕地少，要珍惜每一寸土地。要增加农业投入，重视科学技术和培训教育，提高农民素质，建立健全农业服务体系，加强良种、农田水利、农机和农用工业建设，有条件的地区要发挥农业的适度规模经营效益。他说，当前雨区移向北方，长江流域各地还要注意防旱抗旱，做到防汛抗旱两手抓。他要求各级领导干部切实帮助农民解决困难，想方设法满足农民对生产资料的需要，做好农副产品的收购工作，充分调动农民的积极性，上上下下一起努力，夺取今年农业全面丰收。
    在此期间，江泽民同志还听取了湖北省委关于贯彻十三届四中全会精神情况的汇报，会见了湖北省委、省顾委、省人大、省政府、省军区和省政协的负责同志，视察了武汉钢铁公司、长江流域规划办公室和长江科学院。
