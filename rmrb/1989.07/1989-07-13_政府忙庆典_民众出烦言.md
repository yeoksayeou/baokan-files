As July 14 approaches, Parisians say that Paris has entered a “mad week.” Police and security forces are almost fully mobilized, patrolling the city and making Paris a fortress.

More than 30 heads of state and government from various countries will attend the 200th anniversary celebrations of the French Revolution and the G7 summit. The French government has deployed 30,000 police officers and a large number of emergency personnel to ensure security. Surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft guns, and radar systems have been installed around the city. Strict traffic controls have been implemented in the western part of Paris, with no parking or passage allowed, and iron fences lining the roads.

The newly completed Grande Arche is the venue for the G7 summit. All personnel entering and exiting the building must undergo strict security checks. Hundreds of police officers patrol the building day and night, and thousands of military and police personnel are stationed around the building, with a guard post every three steps and a sentry every five steps. They have also taken control of the rooftops of more than 70 nearby high-rise buildings.

It is estimated that these two events will cost 2 billion francs. Such extravagance has sparked resentment among many French people. They believe that France has 2 million unemployed people, and the government should do something for these people who have no means of livelihood. Last weekend, more than ten groups organized a protest rally and march with over 100,000 people at the Place de la Bastille. Some people pointed out that the French Revolution was a struggle of the Third Estate's poor against the nobility. Holding a summit of the richest countries in the West on the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution may be an irony of history.

    政府忙庆典  民众出烦言
    本报巴黎7月13日电　记者吕网大报道：临近7月14日，巴黎人说巴黎进入了“疯狂的一周”。警察及安全保卫部门几乎倾巢出动，在市区加强巡逻，巴黎处处戒备森严。
    参加法国大革命200周年大庆及出席西方七国首脑会议的将有30多个国家的总统和总理，法国政府为做好安全保卫工作，出动了3万名警察及大批急救人员。城市四周安装了地空导弹、高射机枪及雷达系统。巴黎市区西部实行严格的交通管制，禁止车辆停放和通行，道路两旁排满铁栅栏。
    新落成的门型大厦是七国首脑会议的会址，进出人员都须经过严格的安全检查。数百名警察在大厦内日夜巡逻检查，大厦四周数千军警密布，三步一岗五步一哨，并控制了附近70多座高楼的顶层。
    舆论估计这两项活动将耗资20亿法郎，如此排场，引起不少法国人的反感。他们认为，法国有200万失业者，政府应该为这些无生活着落的人办点事。几十个团体上周末在巴士底广场组织了十余万人的抗议集会游行。一些人士指出，法国大革命是第三等级的贫民反对贵族的斗争，大革命200周年纪念日邀请西方最富有的国家来此聚会，也许是对历史的讽刺。
