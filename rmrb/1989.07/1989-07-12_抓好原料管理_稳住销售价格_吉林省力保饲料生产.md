Since last winter, Jilin Province has experienced a decrease in the stockpile of negotiated corn, leading to an increase in feed prices. According to recent statistics, the price of pig feed has risen by 30% compared to the same period last year, while the prices of other feeds have also increased by about 10%. In response to this situation, the provincial government has taken proactive measures, focusing on ensuring the supply of raw materials and setting reasonable prices to support the production of feed and the development of animal husbandry.

First, attention has been paid to managing feed raw materials. The province strictly controls the export of negotiated corn, prioritizing the needs of local feed production. Based on the province's processing capacity and actual needs, the provincial government recently decided to allocate 400,000 tons of negotiated corn to address the current urgent need for feed raw materials. The feed is to be used exclusively for this purpose and is not to be sold for other uses. The processed feed will prioritize large and medium-sized cities and appropriately scaled specialized farms and households. For major raw materials such as corn, soybean meal, and wheat bran, the province has adopted a method of setting a maximum profit rate. At the same time, a universal system of direct supply from grain depots to processing enterprises has been implemented to reduce links and lower costs.

Second, feed processing enterprises are required to balance corporate profits and social benefits, passing on benefits to the public. The provincial government strengthens operational management, conducts economic accounting, and strives to reduce costs. Simultaneously, it has clearly stipulated that the profit rate for feed processing should not exceed 5% to maintain the stability of feed prices. The provincial government also requires feed processing enterprises to practice "three transparencies": transparency in raw material purchase prices, feed quality, and profit amounts, accepting public supervision.

    抓好原料管理　稳住销售价格
    吉林省力保饲料生产
    本报讯　记者李安达报道：去冬以来，吉林省因议购玉米库存减少，致使饲料价格上升。据近期统计，猪饲料价格比去年同期上涨了30％，其它饲料价格也上升了10％左右。针对这种情况，省政府采取积极措施，着重从保证原料供应和确定合理价格两个方面安排好饲料生产，支持畜牧业发展。
    一是注意抓好饲料原料管理。对议价收购的玉米严格控制出省，优先保证省内饲料生产需要。根据全省加工能力和实际需要，省政府最近决定安排40万吨议价玉米，解决目前饲料原料急需，专粮专用，严禁变卖。加工的饲料，重点保大中城市和适度规模经营的饲养专业场、户需要。对玉米、豆粕、麦麸等主要原料，省里采取限定最高利润率的办法。同时，普遍实行库厂挂钩，饲料粮由粮库直接供给加工企业，减少环节，降低成本。
    二是要求饲料加工企业兼顾企业效益和社会效益，让利于民。省政府加强经营管理，搞好经济核算，努力降低成本，同时明确规定饲料加工利润率不准超过5％，以保持饲料价格的稳定。省政府还要求饲料加工企业做到“三公开”，即原料进价公开，饲料质量公开，利润多少公开，接受群众监督。
