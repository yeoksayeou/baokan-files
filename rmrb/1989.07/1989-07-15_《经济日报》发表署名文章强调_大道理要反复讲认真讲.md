The Economic Daily published a signed article on July 14, emphasizing that the "fundamental principles" of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization must be repeatedly and seriously lectured on.

The article states that during the recent study of the documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the author heard a discordant voice among the masses: "Here we go again with the big principles." The implied meaning is that "big principles" should not be lectured on, and even if they are, it's pointless. In reality, there are two ways to lecture on "big principles": one is in the style of slogans and empty talk, and the other is to lecture seriously and deeply. In recent years, especially during the period when Zhao Ziyang was in charge of the central work, some abnormal phenomena appeared. In some regions and departments, advocating bourgeois liberalization was seen as "reform and opening up," while adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles was seen as "conservative and rigid." A small number of people repeatedly and extensively published liberalization speeches and speeches opposing the Four Cardinal Principles, which were aggressive, while adhering to the truth and carrying out political and ideological education seemed to lack justification and was subject to various criticisms and attacks. Although "big principles" have been lectured on all along, in many cases, it was just a "feint." It was precisely in this situation, when "big principles" were suppressed by small principles and twisted principles, that the regrettable turmoil and riot occurred. Therefore, not lecturing enough on "big principles" and not lecturing deeply enough is a serious lesson.

The article analyzes that "big principles" need to be repeatedly lectured on because many people still do not understand the "big principles." In the turmoil and riot, many young students were incited and used. These young students, during the period when their worldviews were forming, were in a time when political and ideological work was weakest, and bourgeois liberalization was rampant. Many of these students had almost no opportunity to receive "big principles." What they heard were various "salons," liberalization speeches in some publications, and the misleading rumors from "Voice of America." This once again reminds us that "big principles" must be lectured on, and lecturing too little is not enough. "Big principles" are the foundation for young comrades to cultivate their moral character and establish a correct worldview and outlook on life.

The article concludes by saying that currently, the international and domestic situations are complex. We must improve our level of lecturing on "big principles," adhere to the truth, and also use methods that the masses can easily accept. We should connect the international big environment and the domestic small environment, connect the national situation with the specific situation of the unit, and lecture in a deep and shallow way, and in a way that speaks from personal experience. The method of "I speak, you listen, I hit you, you understand" is still not acceptable. The masses have raised high requirements for lecturing on "big principles," and we must strive to improve our skills in propagating the truth in practice, making political and ideological work better and more solid.

### 《经济日报》发表署名文章强调  大道理要反复讲认真讲

    《经济日报》发表署名文章强调
    大道理要反复讲认真讲
    本报讯  《经济日报》7月14日发表一篇署名文章强调，坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的“大道理”，要反复讲，认真讲。
    文章说，在最近学习党的十三届四中全会文件时，笔者在群众中听到了这样一种不和谐的声音：“又开始讲大道理了”。弦外之音，“大道理”不该讲，讲了也白讲。其实，“大道理”有两种讲法，一种是标语口号式的虚应故事，一种是认真讲，深入讲。近年来，尤其是在赵紫阳同志主持中央工作期间，出现了一些反常的现象，在一些地区和部门，宣扬资产阶级自由化被视为“改革开放”，而坚持四项基本原则被视为“保守僵化”；极少数人反复地、连篇累牍地发表自由化言论，反对四项基本原则的言论，咄咄逼人，而坚持真理，抓政治思想教育则似乎理不直气不壮，受到种种非难和打击。虽然“大道理”一直在讲，但在许多场合下是“虚晃一枪”。正是在这种情况下，在“大道理”被小道理、歪道理压住了的情况下，才发生了令人痛心的动乱和暴乱。因此，“大道理”讲得不够，讲得不透是一个严重的教训。
    文章分析说，“大道理”需要反复讲，还因为有许多人至今并不清楚“大道理”。在动乱和暴乱中，被煽动利用的青年学生很多，这些青年学生在世界观形成的时期，正好是政治思想工作最薄弱，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥时期，这些学生中的许多人几乎没有机会接受“大道理”，他们听到的，是各种“沙龙”，一些报刊上的自由化言论，是《美国之音》蛊惑人心的谣言。这就再一次提醒我们，“大道理”不讲不行，讲少了也不行。“大道理”是青年同志修身立德确立正确世界观、人生观的基本功。
    文章最后说，当前，国际国内情况复杂，我们讲“大道理”的水平必须提高，坚持真理，也要用群众容易接受的方式，联系国际的大气候和国内的小气候，联系全国情况和本单位的具体情况，深入浅出地讲，现身说法地讲。“我讲你听，我打你通”的方法，仍然是不行的。群众已经对讲“大道理”提出了高的要求，就要在实践中努力提高宣传真理的技能，把政治思想工作做得更好，更扎实。
