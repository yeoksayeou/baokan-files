    Some public vehicles in Wuhan have been used to transport individuals to East Lake Swimming Park since the onset of summer. After news organizations publicly disclosed this issue, Wuhan Mayor Zhao Baojiang expressed strong support.

    On July 23, which was a Sunday, reporters at East Lake Moshan Park Swimming Pool discovered that 45 sedans and vans had transported people to the swimming pool. The passengers in these vehicles were mostly families, and they carried spare tires as life rings, stools, and snacks. Some locals expressed their discontent, saying, “In the past, public vehicles were used to transport children to school and to transport people to graves. Now, public vehicles are being used to transport individuals to swim. These people really know how to enjoy life.”

    That same afternoon, reporters found that among the 45 vehicles, two luxury Crown sedans had their license plates removed upon arrival at the swimming pool, presumably to avoid being identified.

    On July 26, Hubei People's Radio Station broadcasted this news in its news program and disclosed some of the vehicle license plates. Upon hearing this, Mayor Zhao Baojiang instructed that this matter must be thoroughly investigated. After verification, it should be publicly criticized in the newspapers and dealt with accordingly.

    Upon verification by the Wuhan Municipal Government Office and the Municipal Traffic Police, the disclosed vehicles belonged to various units including the Wuhan Municipal Government Office, the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, the Municipal Government Document Exchange Center, Hubei Provincial Commercial and Trade Hospital, the Provincial Transportation Planning and Design Institute, the Municipal Chemical Industry Labor Service Company, the Municipal Chemical Raw Materials Wholesale Company, and the Wuhan Iron and Steel Alloy Factory.

    The municipal government and the municipal discipline inspection commission immediately called the relevant units to investigate and deal with the issue.

    It is understood that the Wuhan Municipal Government Office, the Municipal Political Consultative Conference, and the Hubei Provincial Commercial and Trade Hospital quickly investigated the situation and imposed fines on the drivers and swimmers involved. These units also improved their vehicle management measures.

    武汉一些机关公车送私人游泳
    市长支持新闻界公开揭露批评
    新华社武汉7月29日电　（通讯员谢耘耕、记者方政军）进入盛夏以来，武汉市连续出现有人用公车送亲友到东湖游泳场游泳的现象。新闻单位就此向社会公开披露后，得到武汉市市长赵宝江的积极支持。
    7月23日是星期天，记者在武汉东湖磨山公园游泳场发现，有45辆小轿车和面包车送人前去游泳，小车的乘客多是一家一户，并带着作为救生圈的汽车内胎、板凳和糕点饮料等。一些群众不满地说：“过去公车送子女上学，公车送人扫墓，现在又出现公车送私人游泳，这些人真会享清福。”
    当日中午，记者发现，在45辆小车中，有两辆超豪华型皇冠牌轿车怕人记车号，一到游泳场就将牌照取下来。
    7月26日，湖北人民广播电台在新闻节目中披露了这一消息，并公布了一些小车的车号。市长赵宝江闻讯后批示：此事一定要认真抓一下，核实后要认真查处，并要见诸报端，公开予以批评。
    经武汉市政府办公厅与市交通大队核实查对，被披露的这些小车分别属于武汉市人民政府办公厅、市政协、市政府公文交换总站、湖北省财贸医院、省交通规划设计院、市化工局劳动服务公司、市化工原料批发公司和武钢铁合金厂等单位。
    市政府、市纪委立即打电话督促有关单位予以查处。
    据悉，武汉市政府办公厅、市政协、湖北省财贸医院等单位迅速查明情况后，分别对司机及参与游泳人员给予经济罚款并责成作出检查。这些单位还健全了车辆管理措施。
