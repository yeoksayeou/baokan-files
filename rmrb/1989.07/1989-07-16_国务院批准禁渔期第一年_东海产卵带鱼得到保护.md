	Every year during May and June, hundreds of state-owned and collective fishing vessels would gather in the East China Sea to conduct large-scale fishing operations targeting spawning yellow croaker. This year, however, the situation has significantly improved. In May and June of this year, the entire East China Sea region saw a reduction of 15,000 spawning yellow croaker compared to the same period last year (and previous years). The number of juvenile yellow croaker has increased by nearly onefold compared to the same period last year.

	This year marks the first year of implementation of the State Council's approval to establish the East China Sea spawning yellow croaker protection zone and to designate the spawning peak period of May and June as a fishing ban period within the protection zone. The governments and relevant departments of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian, and Shanghai have taken various forms to extensively promote education on governing fisheries through law and developing fisheries through law.

	The East China Sea region has established a spawning yellow croaker protection supervision and management command group. Over the course of two months, the group has apprehended and driven away more than 40 fishing vessels that violated regulations, confiscating over 2,000 kilograms of caught fish.

    国务院批准禁渔期第一年
    东海产卵带鱼得到保护
    本报讯　每年5、6月份，全国数百对国营、集体渔轮汇集在东海大规模扫荡产卵带鱼的现象，今年明显改观。今年5、6两月，整个东海区比去年（也是历年）同期少捕1.5万产卵带鱼。幼带鱼发生量比去年同期增加近一倍。
    今年是国务院批准设立东海产卵带鱼保护区、规定保护区内5、6月份产卵高峰期为禁渔期付诸实施的第一年。东海区所属的浙、苏、闽、沪3省1市的各级政府和有关部门，采用多种形式，普遍开展了以法治渔、以法兴渔的教育。
    东海区专门成立产卵带鱼保护监督管理指挥小组，两个月时间共查获、驱赶违规渔船40多对（艘），没收渔获物2000多公斤。　（徐博龙）
