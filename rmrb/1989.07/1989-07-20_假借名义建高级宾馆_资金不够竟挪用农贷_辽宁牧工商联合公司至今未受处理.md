    **Using the Pretext of Building a High-End Hotel, Funds Fall Short and Agricultural Loans Are Misappropriated**

    **Liaoning Livestock, Industry, and Commerce United Company Yet to Be Addressed**

    **Reported by Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Xinxin**

    The Liaoning Livestock, Industry, and Commerce United Company used the pretext of building a livestock product trading service center to construct the high-end Jiuzhou Grand Hotel. Due to the continuous upgrading of construction and decoration standards, funds were insufficient, and 60 million yuan in specialized loans for animal husbandry were misappropriated. This serious issue has recently been investigated and confirmed by relevant supervisory departments.

    The 16-story Jiuzhou Grand Hotel, standing on Huanghe Street in Shenyang, began construction in September 1985. According to relevant departments, the project proposal submitted by the provincial animal husbandry department to the provincial government at that time stated, "Construction of the Livestock Product Trading Service Center Building," with a total area of 13,000 square meters and a total investment of 80 million yuan. Its purpose was stated as "serving the development of the province's animal husbandry industry." However, in reality, they were building a high-end hotel.

    Currently, most of the Jiuzhou Grand Hotel has been completed. In addition to 18 high-end rooms with a daily rate of 100 yuan and 135 mid-range rooms, it also has a bar, a dance hall, and five elegant restaurants of varying sizes. Additionally, there is a 4,000-square-meter commercial area on five floors that is currently under renovation. Due to the continuous upgrading of standards after the start of construction, the actual construction cost has reached 198 million yuan. In the face of insufficient funds, they used various pretexts to divert the much-needed agricultural loans to the construction of the Jiuzhou Grand Hotel. What is even more baffling is that despite the central government's repeated orders over the past few years to reduce the construction of buildings and facilities, such a high-end hotel has been consistently listed as a key provincial project.

    Currently, this issue has not been addressed.

### 假借名义建高级宾馆  资金不够竟挪用农贷  辽宁牧工商联合公司至今未受处理

    假借名义建高级宾馆
    资金不够竟挪用农贷
    辽宁牧工商联合公司至今未受处理
    本报讯　新华社记者刘欣欣报道：辽宁省牧工商联合公司以建畜产品贸易服务中心为名，修建高级宾馆——九州大厦。由于建筑装修档次不断提高，资金不足，竟然挪用了600万元种养业专项贷款。这一严重问题最近被有关监察部门查实。
    矗立在沈阳黄河大街的16层高的九州大厦是1985年9月开始动工兴建的。据有关部门介绍，当时省畜牧厅呈报给省政府的项目请示报告写的是
  “建畜产品贸易服务中心楼”，总面积为1.3万平方米，总投资800万元。其用途是“为全省畜牧事业的发展服务”。可实际上他们却是在建高级宾馆。
    目前，九州大厦大部分已经建成，除设有18个每天宿费100元的高级房间和135个中档房间外，还设有酒巴间、舞厅及5个幽雅别致的大小餐厅。另外还有5层4000平方米的商场正在装修中。由于动工后一再提高档次，实际造价已达1980万元。在资金不足的情况下，他们采取种种名目把十分短缺的农业贷款挪用到建九州大厦上。更令人费解的是尽管近几年中央三令五申压缩楼堂馆所建设，可这样一座高级宾馆一直被列为省重点工程项目。
    目前，这一问题尚未得到处理。
