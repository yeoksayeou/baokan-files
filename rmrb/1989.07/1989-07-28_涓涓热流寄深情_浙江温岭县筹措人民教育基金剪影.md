    "In this trial run of fundraising for the people's education fund, there are three things we didn't expect: first, we didn't expect the village cadres to be so united and determined; second, we didn't expect the party members and cadres to lead by example in donating and raising funds to such a large extent; third, we didn't expect the enthusiasm of the masses to be so high." This is what Chen Qifang, the Party Secretary of Songmen District in Wenling County, Zhejiang Province, said at a district-wide cadre meeting on April 17.

    To implement the spirit of the provincial education conference, improve the conditions for running schools, and accelerate the development of the education cause, Wenling County began a trial run of fundraising for the people's education fund in Songmen District on April 2. In a short period of over half a month, 890,000 yuan was raised, and many moving scenes of people eagerly donating funds emerged.

    [Scene 1] At the district-level cadre meeting, the 17 members of the county committee's work group took the lead in donating, with county committee deputy secretary Chen Xiade and deputy county head Guo Jianyu generously donating 100 yuan each. Other comrades also donated 20 yuan, 30 yuan, and so on, totaling 560 yuan.

    [Scene 2] At the party member and cadre meeting, party members and cadres from various towns and townships took the lead, donating enthusiastically. Over 130 party members and cadres in the district donated over 100 yuan each. Dai Yunzhang, a 76-year-old party member from Xinnan Village in Chuanbei Township, donated 110 yuan saved from his frugal living. He said, "Though I am old, my heart is still young. Education is a big deal. This hundred yuan may not be much, but it shows my intention." The party branch of Xianan Village in Shangma Township donated the 1,000 yuan reward for achieving the target management advanced unit last year as the people's education fund. Mao Qide, a Communist Party member and village head of Nanyi Village, rushed to the meeting on April 13 morning to attend his father's funeral and donated 100 yuan on the spot. Zheng Fanglin, a 79-year-old party member from the same village, who receives a monthly subsidy of 15 yuan from the village, also donated 100 yuan and said at the meeting, "This 100 yuan is saved from selling firewood and vegetables. I originally planned to buy a watch, but now that the party attaches so much importance to education, I will use this 100 yuan for education."

    [Scene 3] At the women's meeting, "half of the sky" did not fall behind, and their enthusiasm for education was not inferior to men. Ye Juying, a female cadre from Zhupeng Village in Chuanbei Township, took the lead in donating 100 yuan. Mao Juying, a female cadre from Shupu Village, initially donated 50 yuan. Later, seeing that others donated more, she was restless during the meeting. During the break, she rushed home to get her remaining 52 yuan, donating a total of 102 yuan. She said, "My money is earned from peeling shrimp. I originally planned to buy some jewelry, but now I think it's more important to donate for education."

    [Scene 4] At the mass meeting, Shangma Township raised over 300,000 yuan in just one meeting. The masses said, "This money should be spent for the benefit of future generations." Zhu Peide, a military family member from Zhubei Village in Chuanbei Township, who is not within the scope of fundraising according to regulations, still donated 20 yuan during the meeting. Hu Meifu, a farmer from Cangshan Village in Linchuan Town, donated 500 yuan on April 7 and another 120 yuan on April 11.

    [Scene 5] In schools and township enterprises, the scenes of donating for education were even more moving. Students from Songmen Primary School donated 2,053 yuan from their "red envelope" money and pocket money. Ten Taiwanese compatriots visiting Chuanbei Township also donated 2,600 yuan...

    涓涓热流寄深情
    ——浙江温岭县筹措人民教育基金剪影
      “这次筹措人民教育基金试点工作，有三个没有想到：一是村干部心那么齐、决心那么大没想到；二是党员、干部带头捐款、集资数额这么大没想到；三是群众的热情这么高涨没想到。”浙江温岭县松门区区委书记陈其方在4月17日全区干部会上这样说。
    温岭县为贯彻省教育会议精神，改善办学条件，加快教育事业发展，于4月2日开始，在松门区进行筹措人民教育基金试点。一时间，松门区的大小会议讲教育，广播宣传喊教育，街头巷尾议教育，家家户户谈教育。在短短的半个多月的时间里，就筹措了人民教育基金89万元，涌现出许多争相捐资的动人镜头。
      〔镜头一〕在区级干部会上。县委组织的工作组的17位同志带头捐款，县委副书记陈夏德、副县长郭坚宇慷慨解囊，首先各捐资100元，其他同志也纷纷捐上20元、30元，一共捐资560元。
    〔镜头二〕在党员干部会上。各乡镇的党员干部身先士卒，争先恐后捐款，全区有130多名党员干部捐款在100元以上。川北乡新南村76岁的老党员戴云章，捐出自己平时省吃俭用积蓄的110元钱，他说：“我人老心还没老，办教育是件大事，这百把块钱虽派不上什么大用场，可也算表表我的一点心意。”上马乡盐南村党支部把去年奖给支部目标管理先进的1000元奖金，全部捐出来，作为人民教育基金。南一村共产党员、村民主任毛琪德，4月13日上午刚好要为父亲办理丧事，也赶去参加会议，并当场捐款100元。这个村79岁的老党员郑方林，村里每月要补贴他15元生活费，他也捐款100元，并在会上说：“这100元钱，是我平时卖柴、卖菜积蓄的，本想买块手表戴戴，现在党这么重视教育，我就把这100元钱用于办学。”
    〔镜头三〕在妇女会上。“半边天”不甘落后，办学热情不亚于男子汉。川北乡竿蓬村妇女干部叶菊英抢先捐了100元。水浦村妇女干部毛菊英开始捐了50元，后来看看别人捐的比她多，开会时坐立不安，趁会议休息的时间，跑回家里拿了仅有的52元钱，共捐了102元。她说：“我的钱是剥虾挣来的，原计划打副首饰戴戴，现在不想打了，先捐资办学要紧”！
    〔镜头四〕群众会上。上马乡仅在一次会上就集资了3万多元。群众说，为子孙后代造福，这个钱该出。川北乡竿北村军属户朱沛德，按规定不属筹措对象，但他在开会时送来20元钱，坚决要捐。淋川镇苍山村农民胡梅富在4月7日捐了500元，又在4月11日捐资120元。
      〔镜头五〕在学校，在乡镇企业，捐资办教育的场面更动人，松门小学学生捐出“压岁钱”和零花钱2053元。正在川北乡探亲的10位台胞也捐献了2600元……
