	Japan has 899 species of plants that have already become extinct or are on the brink of extinction, accounting for 17% of the total number of wild plant species in Japan. This is the result of a survey conducted by the Japan Wildlife Conservation Society and the World Wildlife Fund Japan over the past three years, which covered 5,300 species of wild plants in Japan. The main causes of the extinction of wild plants in Japan are the reclamation of wetlands, deforestation, and the destruction of grasslands for cultivation.

    日大量植物濒临灭绝
    日本有899种植物已经或濒临灭绝，占日本野生植物总种类数的17％。这是日本自然保护协会和世界自然保护基金日本委员会根据过去3年中对日本5300种野生植物进行调查的结果。开拓沼泽地带、砍伐森林和毁草垦田等是造成日本野生植物灭绝的主要原因。
