    American Chinese Professor Wang Jizhen Supports China's Crackdown on Counter-Revolutionary Riots
    Cannot Tolerate Lawless Behavior

    The People's Daily reports: The retired Chinese literature professor at Columbia University in the United States, Wang Jizhen, recently published an article in the New York *Sing Tao Daily*, supporting the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots.

    Wang Jizhen pointed out that the recent demonstrations in Beijing were undoubtedly aimed at overthrowing the current government and establishing a democratic capitalist system in China. "To save the system they have fought for decades to establish, the leaders of the Chinese Communist Party have the responsibility to suppress any counter-revolutionary movements. This is their duty, and they cannot allow the movement to spiral out of control, nor can they allow the movement to pose a real threat to China's only effective and stable government this century." The article believes that "the military's action was timely."

    This American Chinese professor expressed regret over the bloodshed but believed that it was better to have "a little bloodshed" than to have a civil war. A civil war might be as prolonged and bloody as the American Civil War, and the situation might be even worse. Regardless of the verdict on the American Civil War, this is not an example that the Chinese people can follow or imitate.

    He further pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party's rule over mainland China for forty years is the only stable period in China this century, and it may also be the longest period in Chinese history with unprecedented progress and considerable prosperity. Life may be hard, but there is rarely hunger or famine. Most people have had a better life in the past forty years than in any other period they can remember. If given a choice between the benefits of the current government's stability and the crisis and uncertainties of attempting to establish a new government, it is not difficult to predict that most Chinese people would support the current government.

    Professor Wang Jizhen's article stated that in the recent Tiananmen incident, students first vaguely demanded democracy and then demanded the resignation of Premier Li Peng. In fact, they demanded that the government surrender and step down. They seemed to be imitating the strategies of the American student movement in the 1960s, disrupting traffic, setting fire to cars and buses, and refusing to disperse. When the military entered, they resisted with Molotov cocktails and stones, injuring and killing many soldiers. Under these circumstances, if the legal Chinese government is asked to yield to such lawless behavior, as demanded by American media, that is extremely unreasonable.

### 美籍华人王际真撰文支持我平暴斗争  不能容忍无法无天行为

    美籍华人王际真撰文支持我平暴斗争
    不能容忍无法无天行为
    本报讯  美国哥伦比亚退休华裔中国文学教授王际真先生最近在纽约《星岛日报》上发表文章，支持中国政府平息反革命暴乱。
    王际真指出，最近在北京发生的示威活动的目的，毫无疑问是要打倒现政府，在中国建立一个民主资本主义制度。“为了挽救他们斗争几十年才建立的制度，中国共产党的领袖们有责任去镇压任何的反革命运动。这是他们的责任，不能让运动演变成失去控制，不能让运动对中国在这个世纪内唯一有效而稳定的政府，造成真正的威胁。”文章认为，“开进军队的行动是及时的”。
    这位美籍华人教授对发生流血事件表示遗憾，但他认为与其爆发内战，不如是流“少许血”较佳。一场内战可能会像美国南北战争一般漫长而又血腥，情况可能还要更差，无论对美国南北战争的定论是如何，这绝非中国人民能够去追随与模仿的例子。
    他进而指出，中共政府在中国大陆四十年的统治，是中国在本世纪内唯一稳定的时代，也可能是中国历史上为时最长、能够获得前所未有的进步与相当繁荣的政府。生活可能是艰苦的，但很少有饥饿或饥荒问题，大部分的人民在过去四十年内的环境，都比记忆中的任何其他时期有较好的生活。如果是在现政府稳定的好处与面临试图建立新政府的危机与未可知数中作一选择，可以不难预料到，大部分的中国人民都会支持现政府。
    王际真教授的文章说，在最近的天安门事件中，学生首先是含糊地要求民主，又要求总理李鹏辞职。事实上，他们要求政府投降下台。他们似乎在模仿六十年代美国的学生运动策略，扰乱交通，纵火焚烧汽车、巴士、又拒绝散去，当军队开进时，他们以汽油弹及石块抵抗，打伤与打死了不少士兵。在这种情况下，如果要求合法的中国政府对这种无法无天的行为低头，如美国传播媒体所要求者，那是极不合理的。
