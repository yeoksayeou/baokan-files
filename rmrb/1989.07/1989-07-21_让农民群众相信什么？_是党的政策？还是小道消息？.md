    What Should the Peasant Masses Believe? Party Policies or Rumors?
    This year in March, I spent nearly two months in Malipo County conducting rural situation education and felt that the ten years of reform have indeed brought changes to the lives of peasants, which should be attributed to the various policies formulated by the Party.
    However, currently, peasants' understanding of the Party and government policies has a fragile aspect. Perhaps it is because our Party had the flaw of frequently changing policies in the past, leading the masses to listen to and believe in rumors, making their nerves especially sensitive. In recent years, due to the weakening of ideological and political work, there has been little propaganda among peasants about the Party's various policies in rural areas. The masses eagerly await timely updates on the Party's policies, but no one is there to explain and interpret them. Some peasants told the working staff: "In the past, the Communist Party had many meetings, with a big meeting every three days and a small meeting every two days, and we were afraid of meetings. But in these few years, there hasn't been a meeting in one or two years, and now we want to have meetings again."
    Due to these reasons, many rumors in society have become the main basis for peasants to speculate about policy changes, leading to the situation where peasants easily believe in rumors. Our work team learned of an incident in a village in Donggan Township that is worth pondering. One day, many families in the village suddenly started slaughtering pigs. The village cadres were puzzled, as this day was neither a festival nor an important activity, so why were the peasants so anxious to slaughter their pigs? After investigation, it turned out that someone in the village had spread the rumor that due to the tight supply of pork in cities, the state would restore the "buy and retain half" policy for pig purchases. The peasants, fearing the loss of their existing benefits, resorted to this measure.
    This incident shows that the spread of rural rumors can be easily believed by peasants, which has a lot to do with the lack of policy propaganda work by the Party and the lack of ideological work among peasants. Regarding this, various levels of leadership departments should pay good attention to this work, making the Party's various policies more widely and deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, and eliminating the various concerns hidden in the hearts of the broad peasant masses.

### 让农民群众相信什么？  是党的政策？还是小道消息？

    让农民群众相信什么？
    是党的政策？还是小道消息？
    今年3月，我到麻栗坡县搞了近两个月的农村形势教育，感到十年改革确实给农民的生活带来了变化，这应归功于党制定的各项政策。
    但是，目前农民对党和政府的政策的理解含有脆弱的一面。也许是我们党过去有政策多变的缺点，导致群众偏听偏信，神经特别敏感。近几年，由于削弱了思想政治工作，很少对农民宣传党在农村的各项政策。群众盼望随时了解党的政策，没有人去给他们宣讲和解释。一些农民对工作人员说：“过去共产党的会多，三天一大会，两天一小会，我们怕开会。可这几年是一两年不开一次会，我们又想开会了。”
    由于这些原因，使社会上的许多小道消息成为农民猜度政策变化的主要依据，出现了农民偏听偏信小道消息的情况。我们工作组在董干乡一个村了解到这样一件事，很令人深思。有一天，该村突然有许多人家杀起猪来，村干部们很奇怪，这天既不是什么节日，也没什么重要活动，农民为何都紧张地把猪给杀了？经过调查，原来是村里有人传说，由于城市猪肉供应紧张，国家将恢复实行生猪收购的“购留各半”政策，农民怕失掉既得的利益，才出此下策。
    这一事例说明，农村小道消息传播能被农民轻信，与党的政策宣传工作和农民的思想工作的开展不力有很大关系。对此，各级领导部门要好好抓一下这项工作，使党的各项政策更加广泛深入人心，消除藏在广大农民心头的各种顾虑。
