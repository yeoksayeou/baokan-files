Over 5,000 industrial enterprises in Beijing, including those at the county level and above, have swiftly resumed production following the turmoil. The million-strong industrial workforce is spirited and determined to overcome difficulties, continuing to consolidate and improve the contract responsibility system. This has resulted in a favorable situation where the total industrial output value for the first half of the year increased by 8.7% compared to the same period last year, and economic efficiency has also grown in tandem.

To ensure the smooth progress of industrial production for the entire year, meet the annual industrial output value target of 45.2 billion yuan, achieve an 8% growth in both industrial development speed and economic efficiency compared to last year, and fulfill the plan to increase municipal fiscal revenue by 4% compared to last year, Mayor Chen Xitong and Vice Mayor Wu Yi, who oversees industry, led officials from the Economic Commission and other departments to visit the "Cotton Textile Mill" in the eastern suburbs of the city on July 6. They conducted on-site inspections in the workshops and held discussions with industry executives, including those from the textile sector, on the issue of preventing production slippage.

After carefully studying the difficulties faced by several cotton mills, such as energy shortages, foreign exchange constraints, and insufficient frontline labor force, Chen Xitong and others proposed solutions. Chen Xitong stated, "The contract base for enterprises remains unchanged, and industrial production must not slip. To truly make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and riots, the contract base must remain unchanged; to falsely make up for the losses, the contract base would change. We must truly make up for the losses. If cotton textile enterprises and the textile industry can make up for the losses, other enterprises and industries must also do so. Enterprises that complete their contract targets will have the government firmly honor the contracts, with no reneging. In implementing the contract responsibility system, no one will back down. Government departments must genuinely serve enterprises in implementing the contract system. Continue to deepen reforms, further invigorate the city's 100 large and medium-sized enterprises. The Economic Commission and other departments should discuss measures with enterprises, and we will study them promptly."

    北京工业产值效益同步增长
    陈希同强调企业承包基数不变工业生产不能滑坡
    本报北京7月7日讯　记者张书政报道：北京5000多户乡以上单位所属工业企业，在暴乱后一周迅速恢复生产，百万产业大军精神振奋，克服困难，继续巩固和完善承包责任制，出现上半年工业总产值比去年同期增长8.7％、经济效益保持同步增长的可喜局面。
    为抓好全年的工业生产，确保完成全年工业总产值452亿元的计划，确保全年计划的工业发展速度与经济效益比去年同步增长8％，确保市财政比去年增长4％的计划指标，7月6日，市长陈希同和主管工业的副市长吴仪，带领经委等机关干部到市东郊“棉纺片”企业，深入车间，了解恢复生产情况，并与纺织系统等工业企业干部就“生产不能滑坡”问题进行座谈。
    在对几家棉纺厂存在的能源、外汇、一线劳动工人力量不足等困难经过审慎研究后，陈希同等提出了处理意见。陈希同说，企业承包基数不变，工业生产不能滑坡。要把动乱和暴乱造成的损失真夺回来，就是承包基数不变；假夺回来，就是承包基数变了，我们要真夺回来。连棉纺企业、纺织行业都能夺回来，其他企业、其他行业更要夺回来。企业完成承包指标，政府也坚决兑现合同，决不食言，在落实承包责任制上，咱们谁都不变。政府有关部门要切切实实地为企业落实承包制做好服务工作。继续深化改革，把全市百户大中型企业进一步搞活。经委等部门要与企业商讨措施，我们好抓紧研究。
