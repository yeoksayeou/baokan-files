The National Football First Division League A Group completed its first stage on July 9th with the final round of matches. In Dalian, an upset occurred as Shanghai Team defeated the National Second Team 1-0. In Qingdao, another surprise happened when the Eighth Army Team lost 0-1 to Guangdong Team. Liaoning Team won 1-0 against Shandong Team. After the first stage, Liaoning Team and the National Second Team are temporarily in the first and second positions respectively.

In the match between the National Second Team and Shanghai Team, the National Second Team seemed to lack tactics. Shanghai Team played solidly, and in the 28th minute of the second half, utilizing a cross from veteran Wang Gang on the right, forward number 11 Li Xiao scored with a header in front of the goal. Combining the results from both venues, the standings for the 7 teams in Group A (Tianjin Team did not participate due to an overseas trip) are as follows: Liaoning Team with 3 wins and 1 draw in 4 matches, 10 points; National Second Team and Eighth Army Team both with 2 wins, 1 draw, and 1 loss in 4 matches, 7 points; Shandong Team with 2 wins, 1 draw, and 2 losses in 5 matches, 7 points; Shanghai Team with 1 win, 1 draw, and 2 losses in 4 matches, 4 points; Guangdong Team with 2 wins and 3 losses in 5 matches, 6 points; Guangzhou Team with 1 draw and 3 losses in 4 matches, 1 point.

Group B has completed its first round of matches, with Henan Team being the only undefeated team, leading with 29 points. After defeating Beijing Team 1-0 in the final round on July 9th, Dalian Team tied with Hubei Team with 20 points each, both trailing significantly behind Henan Team. Tianjin Port Team is the only team among the 20 participating teams this year that has lost every match, with 0 points.

    全国足球甲级联赛告一段落

    本报讯　全国足球甲级联赛A组，7月9日进行了第一阶段最后一轮比赛。大连赛区爆冷门，上海队1比0击败国家二队。青岛赛区亦爆出冷门，八一队以0比1负于广东队，辽宁队1比0胜山东队。第一阶段赛毕，辽宁队、国二队积分暂居第一、二位。
    国家二队对上海队一战，国家二队显得招数不多。上海队打得有板有眼，在下半时28分，利用老将王钢右路的传中球，由前锋11号李晓在门前头球得手。综合两赛区成绩，A组7支队（天津队出访未参赛），目前积分如下：辽宁队4战3胜1平积10分；国家二队和八一队均为4战2胜1平1负积7分；山东队5战2胜1平2负积7分；上海队4战1胜1平2负积4分；广东队5战2胜3负积6分；广州队4战1平3负积1分。
    B组的比赛打完了第一循环，河南队是唯一保持不败的队伍，以积29分居先。大连队9日在最后一轮1比0战胜北京队后，与湖北队同积20分，并列第二位，但与河南队仍有较大差距。天津港集队是今年联赛20支队伍中，唯一一支每战皆负、积分为0的队伍。
