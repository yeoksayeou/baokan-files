Your newspaper published a letter to the editor on May 31, on the sixth page, titled "This Legal Education Textbook Has Many Typos." The letter criticized the quality of our publishing house's book, "Essential Reading for Deepening Legal Education for Cadres."

The primary responsibility for this incident lies with the printing unit, Beijing Pingle County Datong Printing Factory. The original manuscript of this book was reviewed by our publishing house three times. After it was deemed qualified, it was sent to Datong Printing Factory for typesetting. After our publishing house and the editors proofread it, the sample book was printed without any issues. However, after printing a small portion of the books, due to the absence of relevant technicians who had gone out, and without anyone to oversee the typesetting technology, the factory unilaterally decided to re-typeset the book using lead type printing. They did not inform our publishing house of this change and did not conduct a thorough proofreading, resulting in numerous errors in all the books printed with the new typesetting.

Upon learning of this situation, we immediately, together with the editors, had several discussions with the factory, demanding that they reprint the book. Now, the factory has agreed to take full responsibility for the incident and the economic losses. Once the new books are printed, we will promptly replace the original erroneous copies.

    印刷错误多的教材将调换
    你报5月31日第六版刊登《这本法制教材错字多》的读者来信，对我出版社的《深化法制教育干部必读》一书的质量问题提出批评。
    事故的责任主要在承印单位北京平谷县大北印刷厂。这本书原稿曾经我社三次审稿，合格后，交大北印刷厂排版，又经我社和编者校正后印出样书，质量没有问题。印了少部分书后，由于这家厂有关师傅外出，无人掌握浇型技术，他们擅自决定重排活字铅版印刷这本书，既没有把这一情况告知我社，也没有认真地校对，致使所有用新排版印制的图书错误百出。
    我们知道这一情况后，立即会同编者数次与这家厂交涉，要求重印此书。现在，这家厂已表示承担事故全部责任及经济损失。新书印好后，我们将尽快对原有错书进行调换。
