Almost everyone who has visited the Tianjin Development Zone to see the Tianlong Double-Wheel Tractor Company has been amazed by the thrift and efficiency of this Sino-American joint venture: with just 12 people, including the manager and employees, they have established a company that can assemble 1,000 units annually!

The product itself is quite unique. At first glance, it resembles a rugged Mongolian horse. It combines the advantages of both a motorcycle and a tractor, featuring dual-wheel drive, a wide range of gear ratios, anti-slip suspension, the ability to traverse deep water, climb mountains, operate in areas without electricity, and meet both the traction requirements of a tractor and the speed requirements of a transportation vehicle. It can smoothly navigate through challenging terrains such as mud, deserts, snow, mountains, canals, forests, and other difficult areas at a speed of 50 kilometers per hour. This is something that no existing small or medium-sized agricultural machinery or transportation vehicle can achieve. It is a unique technology from the American Ranger multinational company.

However, compared to other joint ventures and domestic state-owned or collective enterprises of various sizes, Tianlong Company stands out in its ability to "tighten the belt." The office is modestly decorated, but each one has a bed. The ground floor is an assembly workshop. Once an order comes in, everyone works together to assemble the products, and after completing the work, they sleep in the office. Within 15 days, the products are assembled and shipped. All 12 people, including the manager, work on the assembly line to complete the task. The reporter saw the Chinese manager, Wu Xiying, demonstrating the operation at his workstation. The quality of their assembly impressed even the president of the American multinational company, Richard, who commented, "It's even better than what we assembled in the past." So far, this product has established trade relations or contacts with 27 countries and regions, including Australia, Finland, Nigeria, and Singapore. Domestically, it has established business relations with 10 provinces and cities, including the Great Khingan Range, Daqing Oilfield, and the Inner Mongolia grasslands. It has been praised by Australian customers as a model that fully meets the requirements.

"Rich people can use it to fish by the sea or travel in the mountains. Pioneers can use it for plowing, weeding, harvesting, pulling wood, sowing, fertilizing, and firefighting. Equipped with a telescope and a machine gun, it can also serve as an iron horse for border military patrols!" Manager Wu introduced to the reporter.

"How did you manage to achieve such efficiency with just 12 people, running a front-office and back-factory operation?"

Manager Wu smiled, "First, we have a high concentration of intelligence. Out of the 12 people in the company, there are 2 technicians, 5 engineers, and 2 assistants. Second, we have extensive cooperation. 70% of the vehicle's components have been localized. Thousands of parts are produced by 42 enterprises in Tianjin, and we strictly control the quality. Third, we have a one-specialty-multiple-skills optimized combination. Everyone is a salesperson, assembler, and inspector, fully realizing their self-worth."

As he spoke, a financial officer demonstrated a test drive. The officer rode the double-wheel tractor from a distance, effortlessly crossing a few steps in front of the reporter, and sped past, appearing both fierce and agile, full of explosive power.

From their energetic and harmonious efforts, the reporter saw an even more precious kind of explosive power.

    紧日子的爆发力
    ——中美合资企业天龙双轮拖拉机公司纪事
    本报记者　肖荻
    凡是到天津开发区看过天龙双轮拖拉机公司的人，几乎无不为这家中美合资企业勤俭办厂的劲头咄咄称奇：连经理带职工仅仅12人，竟办起一个年装配1000辆产品的企业！
    那产品就够独特的。看上去，活像一匹粗犷的蒙古马。它，兼有摩托车和拖拉机两种优点，双轮驱动，变速范围广，防滑减震，可涉深水，可爬高山，可在无电源地区工作，既可满足作为拖拉机对牵引力的要求，又可满足做为交通工具对于较高速度的要求，以每小时50公里的速度顺利通过泥沼、沙漠、雪地、山路、水渠、丛林等艰难地段，这是任何现有的中、小型农机具和交通工具所难以做到的。它是美国RANger跨国公司的一项独特技术。
    然而，比之一般合资企业，也比之我国大、中、小国营和集体企业，天龙公司在“过紧日子”上尤其富有特色。在办公室看不到什么华贵装饰，却都备有一张床。一楼则是一个装配车间。只要订单一到，人们就全力组装，干完后在办公室过夜，15天内即可装箱发货。全公司12人包括经理全部进入组装线合力完成。记者在车间看到中方经理吴希瑛坐到自己的工位上示范操作。他们组装的质量连美国跨国公司总裁理查德见了都称：比过去美国组装的还要好。迄今，这一产品在国外已与澳大利亚、芬兰、尼日利亚、新加坡等27个国家和地区建立了贸易关系或联系。在国内已与大兴安岭、大庆油田、内蒙古牧区等10省市建立了业务关系。被澳大利亚客户评为完全合乎要求的理想样机。
    “富裕者可以用它到海滨钓鱼，到山区旅游。开拓者可用它犁耙、除草、收割、拖木、播种、施肥、灭火。安上望远镜和机枪，还是边境军事巡逻的铁骑！”吴经理向记者介绍。
    “你们仅12人就搞起一个前店后厂，是怎样取得如此的精干、高效？”
    吴经理粲然一笑：“第一条：智力密集。全公司12人中高工2人、工程师5人、助工2人。第二条：广泛协作。全车70％部件已实现国产化。成千零件在天津市42家企业协作配套生产，我们严格把关。第三条：一专多能优化组合。人人是业务员、装配员、检验员，充分实现自我价值”。
    说话间，一位管财务的干部试车表演。只见他骑上双轮拖拉机从远处跑来，到我眼前越过几尺高台阶时如履平地，急驶而过显得慓悍而灵巧，富有爆发力。
    从他们那奋发而默契的干劲上，记者看到一种更可贵的爆发力。
