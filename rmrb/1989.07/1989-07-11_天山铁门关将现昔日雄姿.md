The ancient Iron Gate Pass, which once commanded the Silk Road, has begun reconstruction at its original site.

The Iron Gate Pass is located at the exit of the Tian Shan gorge to the northwest of Kulja, a city famous for its pears. Historically, it was a crucial passage connecting the southern and northern regions of the Silk Road. Its terrain is such that "one man can hold the pass against ten thousand," and on the cliff face, one can still see the four bold characters "surrounded by mountains and rivers" carved by ancient people.

The newly reconstructed gate tower is built with blue bricks, standing 17 meters high and 16 meters wide. Inside the tower, there is an exhibition hall displaying unearthed cultural relics. The reconstruction of the gate tower will add to the scenic beauty of this famous tourist spot.

    天山铁门关将现昔日雄姿
    新华社乌鲁木齐7月11日电　（记者亚力坤）古代威震丝绸之路的铁门关城楼，日前开始在原址兴建。
    铁门关位于塞外梨乡库尔勒市西北方向的天山峡谷出口处，历史上曾是丝绸之路沟通南北疆的重要通道，其地形大有“一夫当关，万夫莫开”之势，岩壁上至今可见古人刻下的“襟山带河”四个苍劲大字。
    新仿建的关楼用青砖砌造，楼高17米，宽16米，楼内设有展览有关出土文物的陈列室。新关楼的修建，将为这处颇有名气的游览胜地再添美景。
