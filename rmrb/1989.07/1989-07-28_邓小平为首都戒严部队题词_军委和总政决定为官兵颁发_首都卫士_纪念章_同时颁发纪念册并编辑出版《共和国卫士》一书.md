In commemoration of the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the great People's Liberation Army, Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Central Military Commission inscribed "Guardians of the Republic" and "Guardians of the Capital" for the capital's martial law troops. The Central Military Commission and the General Political Department have decided to award the "Guardians of the Capital" commemorative medal and album to all officers and soldiers of the capital's martial law troops, and to compile and publish the book "Guardians of the Republic."

A responsible comrade from the General Political Department pointed out that Chairman Deng Xiaoping's inscriptions and the decisions of the Military Commission reflect the deep concern and affection of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries and the Central Military Commission for the broad masses of officers and soldiers in the martial law troops. This is a high evaluation and reward for the historical merits of the martial law troops in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots. It also embodies the ardent expectations for the entire army, which will greatly inspire and encourage all soldiers of the army to cherish the high honor bestowed by the Party and the people, carry forward the fine traditions of the army, thoroughly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, strengthen the overall construction of the army, and make new contributions to the motherland and the people!

The "Guardians of the Capital" commemorative medal is made of copper with gold plating, divided into the main medal and the miniature medal. The main medal has the inscription "Guardians of the Capital" written by Comrade Deng Xiaoping on the horizontal plaque. The center of the main medal is composed of a five-star and Tiananmen Gate pattern, symbolizing the Republic and Beijing. The surrounding osmanthus leaves symbolize victory. The ribbon and the assault rifle pattern at the bottom are inscribed with the date "1989.6.", symbolizing the most unforgettable period when the capital's martial law troops resolutely fought to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, and the significant contributions made for this.

The miniature medal is composed of a five-star, Tiananmen Gate, and the red, black, and blue ribbons of the army, navy, and air force.

The "Guardians of the Capital" commemorative album is a hardcover 25th edition. The cover is printed with Chairman Deng Xiaoping's inscription, and the album includes excerpts from Chairman Deng Xiaoping's speech when he met with military-level cadres of the capital's martial law troops, the pattern of the "Guardians of the Capital" commemorative medal, photographs reflecting the capital and the martial law troops, and maps of the People's Republic of China and the world.

The book "Guardians of the Republic" will collect a series of important documents from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riots, as well as the heroic deeds of units and individuals who have been awarded honorary titles and commended by the Central Military Commission. It is a vivid and realistic textbook of patriotism and revolutionary heroism.

The "Guardians of the Capital" commemorative medal, album, and the book "Guardians of the Republic" will be distributed to the troops in succession before and after August 1st.
