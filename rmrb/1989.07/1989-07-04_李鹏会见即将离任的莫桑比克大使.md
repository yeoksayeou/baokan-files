Premier Li Peng today met with the outgoing Mozambican Ambassador to China, Lopes Nderlane, in the Zhongnanhai's Ziguangge Hall this afternoon and had a cordial and friendly conversation with him.

Premier Li Peng said that China has always regarded the development of friendly relations with Third World countries as a fundamental aspect of its foreign policy. China and African countries share a common historical experience of suffering from external interference and subversion, and we face the common task of safeguarding national sovereignty. We can understand and support each other. Many African countries have taken a just attitude towards China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots.

When discussing the international situation, Premier Li Peng pointed out: Although the world situation has shown a trend of easing, the North-South contradictions have not been resolved. Many developing countries are struggling under the heavy burden of debt. The unequal exchange in international trade has exacerbated the poverty of developing countries. This is an unstable factor in the current world situation and should be of concern to the international community.

    李鹏会见即将离任的莫桑比克大使
    新华社北京7月4日电　国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了即将离任的莫桑比克驻华大使洛佩斯·恩德拉内，并同他进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    李鹏总理说，中国始终把发展同第三世界国家的友好关系作为我们对外政策的一个基本点。我们同非洲国家有着遭受外来干涉和颠覆的共同历史遭遇，面临着维护国家主权的共同任务，是能够相互理解和支持的。对中国平息反革命暴乱事件，许多非洲国家采取了公正态度。
    在谈到国际形势时李鹏总理指出：尽管世界形势出现了缓和趋势，但南北矛盾没有得到解决。许多发展中国家被沉重的债务压得喘不过气来。在国际贸易中的不等价交换加剧了发展中国家的贫困。这是当今世界形势中一个不安定的因素，应当引起国际社会的关注。
