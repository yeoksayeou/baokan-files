    People's Daily, Xi'an, July 23rd. Reporter Jiang Jianke reports: In the heat of summer, vast amounts of wheat straw are being burned by farmers. Recently, Professor Yang Xufu of Northwest Agricultural University has developed a machine that can press wheat straw and other crop stalks into a "honeycomb coal" shape. This is a major breakthrough in the utilization of biomass energy in China.

    This shaping machine can process waste from all agricultural and forestry products into a form, with an appearance similar to ordinary honeycomb coal. It burns more completely than honeycomb coal, has very little ash, and has great promotional value.

    麦秆可制“蜂窝煤”
    本报西安7月23日电　记者蒋建科报道：盛夏，成片成堆的麦秆被农民白白烧掉。西北农业大学教授杨忪甫最近研制成一种能将麦秆等压制成“蜂窝煤”状的作物秸秆固化成型机。这是我国生物质能利用新技术的一个重大突破。
    这种成型机，可以把一切农林产品的废弃物加工成型，其外型与一般蜂窝煤差不多，燃烧比蜂窝煤完全充分，灰分极少，推广价值大。
