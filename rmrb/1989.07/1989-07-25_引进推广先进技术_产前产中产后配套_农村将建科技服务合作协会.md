The State Science and Technology Commission's Deputy Director, Guo Shuyan, recently revealed that the State Science and Technology Commission will begin, starting this year, to pilot the establishment of a number of new types of science and technology service cooperatives in rural areas of China. These cooperatives will be composed mainly of farmers, agricultural technicians, and science and technology personnel. The commission will allocate 2 million yuan for the establishment of these science and technology cooperatives.

Guo Shuyan recently inspected science and technology poverty alleviation work in the Dabie Mountains of Anhui Province. He said that these cooperatives are different from previous cooperatives. They will be established on the basis of voluntary participation by farmers, equality and mutual benefit, and democratic management. Their main tasks will be to introduce, demonstrate, and promote applicable advanced technologies, and to provide comprehensive pre-production, in-production, and post-production services through various forms.

This type of cooperative will be a more superior rural production structure compared to the current household contract responsibility system. It will effectively solve the problems of individual farmers operating independently, being weak, and having no support. It will organically link and organize the production and operation activities of individual farmers, increasing the socialization of production. This cooperative will not be profit-oriented. Its funds will mainly come from the contributions of members, used for the development of production and operation by members, and to take the path of becoming rich through science and technology and achieving common prosperity.

It is understood that the State Science and Technology Commission will establish dozens of science and technology cooperatives in some provinces and regions this year, and then expand to 100 to 200 points. After gaining experience, it will be fully promoted and developed on a large scale.

    引进推广先进技术
    产前产中产后配套
    农村将建科技服务合作协会
    新华社合肥7月25日电　（记者郭庆华）国家科委副主任郭树言最近透露，国家科委将从今年起，在我国农村试点建立一批新型的以农民、农民技术员、科技人员为主体的科技服务合作协会，并拿出200万元，用于这种科技合作协会的布点工作。
    郭树言最近在安徽省大别山区检查科技扶贫工作时说，这种合作协会不同于以往的合作社，它将建立在农民自愿、平等互利、民主管理的基础上，主要任务是引进、示范、推广适用的先进技术，通过各种形式搞好生产的产前、产中、产后的综合配套服务。
    这种合作协会将是比目前一家一户联产承包更为优越的农村生产结构，它将有效地解决个体农户分散独立经营、势单力薄、无所依靠的困难，把个体农户的生产经营活动有机地联系和组织起来，提高生产的社会化程度。这种协会不以盈利为目的，经费来源主要依赖会员入股筹集，用于会员发展生产经营，走科技致富、共同富裕的道路。
    据悉，国家科委将在年内一部分省区先行建立几十个科技合作协会，然后扩大至100到200个点。取得经验后再全面铺开，大力发展。
