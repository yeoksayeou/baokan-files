Enhancing our immune system and improving our immune function, using immunotherapy to combat diseases such as AIDS and cancer, is currently a hot topic in the global medical community.

Exercise can enhance the immune function of the immune system. German immunologist Professor Peter Schlechta's research on human cells found that the number of immune cells in the human body increases with the amount of activity, while those who sit for long periods have insufficient immune cells. Soviet scientists also discovered that astronauts who spend extended periods in space have weakened immune system functions due to lack of exercise. Researchers at the Harvard University School of Public Health found that women who regularly exercise to maintain a slim figure significantly reduce the incidence of breast and reproductive system cancers. Generally, the CPM value, which indicates the strength of immune function, decreases almost linearly with age. For those under 40, the average CPM value is 190,000, around 50 it is 150,000, and at 80 it is only 60,000. However, for those who are active, have a cheerful disposition, and have normal nutrition, their immune function remains very robust. Keio University's Clinical Examination Department conducted a study on the blood of 35 centenarians and found that their average CPM value was 70,000, higher than the average CPM value of 80-year-olds.

A balanced diet can improve your immune system. American scientists studying obese teenagers found that nearly 40% of them had weakened immune resistance to viruses. Therefore, they pointed out that a balanced diet and proper food structure are very important. Scientists also noted that vitamin C can enhance the immune function of the human body and increase the body's ability to fight tumors. Broad surveys have shown that populations with low cancer incidence generally have higher average vitamin C intake. Trace elements like zinc and iron are also essential components of the diet for maintaining and enhancing immune function.

Those who are depressed or overly sad are more prone to illness due to immune system failures. American researchers found that some widowed women experienced significant changes in their immune systems, making them more susceptible to illness and even death. The reason is that the production of important immune cells in their bodies drastically decreased, leading to a breakdown of their defenses. Widowhood is considered the greatest stressor for a person, and how one recovers from grief will directly affect these individuals' lives.

Soviet physiologists conducted a meaningful experiment to restore the immune function of biological organisms—they transplanted a small part of the brain tissue from newborn mice into the brains of elderly mice and found that their immune systems improved significantly. Scientists believe that this method can achieve similar effects in other animals, so they do not rule out the possibility of using this method in the future to activate the immune function of AIDS patients.

Through efforts, American scientists have recently used X-ray crystallography to produce the first three-dimensional image of the immune system (white blood cell antigen), taking an important step towards fully understanding the immune system.

    增强身体的防线——免疫系统
    程荣逵
    增强我们的免疫系统，提高我们的免疫力，采用免疫疗法来对付诸如艾滋病、癌症之类的疾病，这是目前世界医学界的热门课题。
    运动可以增强免疫系统的免疫功能。西德的免疫学家彼德·施莱歇尔教授对人体细胞的研究发现，人体免疫细胞的数量随着活动量的增加而增加，而久坐不动的人，其体内就没有足够的免疫细胞。苏联的科学家也发现，长时间在太空飞行的宇航员们由于缺乏运动，免疫系统功能相对削弱。美国哈佛大学公共卫生学院的研究人员发现，经常运动以保持苗条身材的妇女能显著减少乳腺癌和生殖系统癌症的发病率。一般来说，表示免疫功能强弱的CPM值几乎是随着年龄增长而直线下降的。40岁以下的人的CPM值平均为19万，50岁左右时为15万，80岁上下时仅为6万。但对于那些勤于活动，性格开朗，营养正常的长寿老人来说，他们的免疫机能仍然十分旺盛。日本庆应大学临床检查部对35名百岁以上的老人的血液进行了对疾病的对抗免疫检查，结果发现这35名百岁以上的老人的CPM平均值为7万，比80岁老人的CPM平均值还高。
    结构合理的饮食可以改善你的免疫系统。美国科学家研究一些肥胖青少年时发现，其中近40％的人抵抗病毒的免疫力减弱。因此，他们指出，合理的营养成份和食物结构是十分重要的。科学家还指出，维生素C可以增强人体免疫系统的功能，可以增强人体对付肿瘤的能力，大范围的调查也指出，癌肿发病率低的人群，一般说来，其维生素C的平均摄入量较高。像微量元素锌和铁也都是维持免疫系统、增强免疫功能所不可缺少的食物成份。
    郁郁寡欢者、悲伤过度者容易得病也是由于免疫系统发生故障的结果。美国研究人员研究表明，某些死去丈夫的妇女，她们的免疫系统发生了剧烈的变化；因此极易患病，甚至死亡。原因就是她们体内重要的免疫系统免疫细胞的产生急剧减少，终致防线瓦解。丧偶被认为是对人的最大的刺激，如何从悲痛中走出来，将直接影响这些人的生命。
    苏联生理学家为恢复生物机体免疫系统的功能进行了一个十分有意义的试验——他们把新生小鼠的一小部分脑组织植入年迈老鼠的脑部，发现它们的免疫系统得到明显改善。科学家认为，脑组织的移植在其他动物身上可以获得同样效果，因此科学家不排除将来利用这种方法去激活艾滋病患者免疫力的可能性。
    经过努力，美国科学家最近已用X射线晶体学的方法第一次制出了免疫系统（白细胞抗原）的立体图像，为彻底弄清免疫系统跨出了重要的一步。
