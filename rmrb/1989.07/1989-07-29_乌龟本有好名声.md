    Turtles, in modern times, have become an insulting term, with a rather poor reputation. However, from ancient times to the Tang Dynasty, and perhaps even later, turtles were considered auspicious creatures in people's minds and had a good reputation. First, turtles are long-lived, with lifespans that can exceed a hundred years; second, in ancient times, turtle shells were used as currency, making turtles a symbol of wealth; third, turtle shells were tools for divination and for recording characters, and were essential items in people's daily lives. For these reasons, ancient people valued turtles highly.

    Ancient people not only did not avoid the character "龟" (turtle), but they were also willing to use it and use the image of the turtle. In ancient times, turtles were seen as noble. During the Han Dynasty, the gold seals and seal handles used by high-ranking officials such as the Chancellor, Marquises, and Generals were all in the shape of turtles; officials with salaries of two thousand piculs or more used silver seals and seal handles that were also in the shape of turtles. During the Tang Dynasty, it was stipulated that officials of the fifth rank and above could use turtle-shaped stone bases for their tombstones, while officials below the fifth rank could not have their tombstone bases carved in the shape of turtles.

    It was around the time of the Yuan Dynasty that things began to change. At that time, some people compared men who allowed their wives to be unfaithful to "缩头龟" (shrinking turtles), which suddenly tarnished the noble and sacred image of the turtle.

    乌龟本有好名声
    乌龟，现代成了骂人话，名声相当不佳。但是，从古时到唐代，或许还要更晚一点时候，乌龟在人们概念中是吉祥的东西，它有着好名声。一是乌龟长寿，寿命可达百岁以上；二是古代以龟壳为货币，龟是财宝的象征；三是龟壳是占卜的工具，又是记载文字的工具，是人们生活中不可缺少的必需品。因为这些缘故，古代人视龟为宝。
    古人不但不避“龟”字，且乐意用“龟”字，用“龟”的形象。古代以龟为高贵。汉代丞相、列侯、将军等所用的金印、印钮都是龟形；俸禄二千石以上的大官，所用银印、印钮也是龟形。唐代规定，五品以上的大官，墓前的石碑可用龟砆，就是龟驮石碑，五品以下的官，墓前石碑的碑基，不能刻成龟形。
    大约在元朝时候开始的。当时有人把纵妻行淫者比作“缩头龟”，一下子坏了乌龟的高贵而神圣的形象。
