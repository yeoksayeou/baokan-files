    The Xiaoyi aluminum mines in Shanxi Province, which hold the largest reserves of bauxite in the country, have been severely damaged by unregulated mining activities. The Xiaoyi region alone has over 500 million tons of bauxite reserves, making it the richest in the province. The mines here are shallowly buried with high-grade ore, characterized by high aluminum, low silica, and low iron content. In 1986, the state invested nearly 100 million yuan to build the Xiaoyi Aluminum Mine, capable of producing 500,000 tons annually. This mine supplies raw materials for the key national project, the Shanxi Aluminum Plant, and currently produces 200 to 250 tons per day.

    However, this valuable resource has recently been subjected to severe damage. In the Ke'er mining area, the main ore deposits in the north and south mining fields have been dug into numerous holes by farmers. In the south mining field, 35 holes have been dug into the main ore body; in the new mining area of the north mining field, 22 holes have been dug. These unregulated excavations have extended to the center of the mining area. The result of this unregulated mining is not only the theft of the highest-grade ore but also the inability of large-scale mining machinery to operate, posing a serious threat to safety. Even in areas not yet mined, large groups of unregulated miners have emerged, surrounding the area from all sides.

    Xiaoyi Aluminum Mine Director Hu Liang said, "Throughout the mining area, some farmers are competing with the state for this rich resource." I asked, "But doesn't the state have the 'Mineral Resources Law'?" Director Hu replied, "These people either don't know the law or don't take it seriously. The Xiaoyi County People's Government issued notices in 1986 and 1988 to stop the unregulated mining of aluminum, but to no avail."

    It is understood that Xiaoyi County has 36 township-owned aluminum bauxite factories, producing 30,000 tons of aluminum bauxite annually. These factories purchase large quantities of "top-grade" aluminum ore mined by farmers, process it into high-alumina calcined material, and export it as refractory materials, earning foreign exchange. In 1988, the county exported 25,000 tons of aluminum bauxite, earning over 4.5 million yuan.

    Due to the widespread mining by farmers, the Xiaoyi Aluminum Mine had to form a protection team, but incidents of team members being injured often occur. Facing the damaged ore deposits, the local government must take decisive action to rectify the situation.

### 大批农民滥采乱挖  孝义铝矿遭到破坏

    大批农民滥采乱挖  孝义铝矿遭到破坏
    山西铝土矿的蕴藏量占全国第一，而孝义地区的铝土矿是全省储量最丰富的一个，达5亿余吨。这里的铝矿埋藏浅，品位高，具有铝高、硅低、铁低的特点。1986年，国家投资近亿元，建成年产50万吨的孝义铝矿，为国家重点工程山西铝厂提供原料，现在日产200至250吨。
    然而，这一宝藏近来连续遭到严重破坏。记者在克俄矿区看到，这个矿南北采场的主要矿床，已被农民掏得千疮百孔。在南采场主体矿内，农民挖洞35个；北采场新采区挖洞22个。这些乱挖的洞已延伸到矿区中心地。农民滥采乱挖的结果，不仅盗挖了含铝最高的矿，而且使大型采掘机械无法作业，安全受到严重威胁。在尚未开采的矿区，也出现了大批滥采乱挖的队伍，形成四面包围之势。
    孝义铝矿矿长胡亮说：“在整个矿区内，一些农民正和国家争吃这块肥肉。”我问：“国家不是有《矿产资源法》吗？”胡矿长说：“这些人不知法，也不拿法当一回事。孝义县人民政府1986、1988两年曾发通告制止乱挖铝矿，无济于事。”
    据了解，孝义全县共有乡办的铝矾土厂36个，年产铝矾土3万吨。这些铝矾土厂大量收购农民挖的铝土矿“特级料”，进行高铝煅烧后作为耐火材料（原料）出口创汇，1988年全县就出口铝矾土2.5万吨，收入450余万元。
    由于农民纷纷挖矿，孝义铝矿不得不组成护矿队，但常常发生护矿队被打伤的事。面对被破坏的矿床，当地政府该下决心整治了。本报记者  王艾生
