The U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, Herman Cohen, today in Lisbon spoke about the situation in Southern Africa, stating that the process of reconciliation in Angola is fraught with difficulties and the road is long.

Cohen made these remarks after meeting with Portugal's Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Barroso. He said that he and Barroso had analyzed the situation in Southern Africa and exchanged frank opinions.

Regarding the situation in Angola, Cohen believed that although the Angolan government and UNITA had reached an agreement on the reconciliation process, achieving genuine reconciliation would not be easy. Cohen said that he had a cautious and optimistic attitude towards the reconciliation process in Angola.

When discussing Portugal's proposed "Plan for Aid to Restore Angola's Economy," Cohen said that it was too early to talk about this issue. He stated that only after Angola achieved peace could this plan be realized. He emphasized that the U.S. government would not recognize the Angolan government diplomatically before genuine reconciliation was achieved in Angola.

Cohen also mentioned that during his visit to Mozambique, President Chissano expressed the Mozambican government's hope to resolve domestic conflicts through peaceful political means and requested that the international community create conditions for dialogue and negotiations between the Mozambican government and anti-government forces. Cohen believed that Portugal, the United States, and Southern African countries had the capability to help Mozambique achieve domestic peace.

Cohen arrived in Lisbon on July 14th after a two-week visit to Angola, Mozambique, Zaire, Zambia, South Africa, and Namibia to report on his African tour to the Portuguese side.

    美国负责非洲事务助理国务卿认为
    安哥拉和解道路漫长
    新华社里斯本7月15日电　（记者刘大龙）美国负责非洲事务的助理国务卿赫尔曼·科恩今天在里斯本就南部非洲形势发表讲话说，安哥拉实现和解的进程充满困难，道路漫长。
    科恩是在同葡萄牙外交国务秘书巴罗佐会谈后发表上述讲话的。他说，他同巴罗佐分析了南部非洲形势，并坦率地交换了意见。
    在谈到安哥拉问题时，科恩认为，尽管安哥拉政府和安盟已就和解进程达成协议，但实现真正的和解并不是轻而易举的事。科恩说，他对安哥拉和解进程持乐观和谨慎的态度。
    科恩在谈到葡萄牙提出的“援助安哥拉恢复经济计划”时表示，目前谈论这一问题尚为时过早。他说，只有在安哥拉实现和平之后，这一计划才可能实现。他强调，美国政府在安哥拉没有实现真正和解之前不会在外交上承认安哥拉政府。
    科恩还谈到莫桑比克总统希萨诺在他访莫时表示，莫政府希望通过和平途径政治解决国内冲突，并要求国际社会为实现莫政府与反政府力量间的对话和谈判创造条件。科恩认为，葡萄牙、美国和南部非洲国家有能力帮助莫桑比克实现国内和平。
    科恩是在对安哥拉、莫桑比克、扎伊尔、赞比亚、南非和纳米比亚进行为期两周的访问后于14日抵达里斯本向葡萄牙方面通报访非情况的。
