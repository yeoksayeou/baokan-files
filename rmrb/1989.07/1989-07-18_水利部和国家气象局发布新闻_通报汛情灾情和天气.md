The Ministry of Water Resources and the National Meteorological Administration held a news conference. A reporter from this newspaper, Xiao Junxi, learned that China has achieved initial success in flood control and drought relief in the previous period. Major rivers and levees are safe, and drought conditions in the north have eased. Relevant departments pointed out that the country has now entered the peak flood season. It is necessary to remain vigilant, overcome complacency, and strive for another month to ensure victory in flood control and drought relief, contributing to stability and a bumper harvest.

Since the beginning of summer, southern China has experienced frequent heavy rains and floods, which have been relatively severe. Due to the timely efforts of various levels of leadership in flood control and anti-flood measures, responsibilities and actions have been implemented, and the water resources departments have made meticulous arrangements. Major rivers have not encountered significant problems. However, in some local areas, due to the sudden and intense downpours, extensive and long-lasting rainfall, mountain floods and landslides have occurred, causing some damage. The summer drought in some northern regions was once severe, but due to the effective water conservancy facilities and two timely widespread rains, the drought conditions in most areas have been basically alleviated, and the autumn crops are growing well.

From late July to early August is the peak flood season in China. Historically, major floods often occur during this period. The Yellow, Huai, Hai, and Liao Rivers often experience significant floods after concentrated heavy rains over a few days. According to meteorological forecasts, China may experience two main rain belts in late July: one in the north, covering the eastern and southern parts of Northeast China and the eastern and southern parts of North China, with rainfall significantly higher than the average for the same period in previous years; and one in the south, covering South China and the eastern part of Southwest China, with rainfall in Fujian and Guangdong coastal areas higher than the average. In August, rainfall will increase in most parts of North China, Northeast China, and the Yellow River basin. Therefore, all regions must fully prepare for more significant floods, in accordance with the special flood defense plans for the Yangtze, Yellow, Huai, and Yongding Rivers approved by the State Council, to ensure all preparations are foolproof. During this period, southern regions will experience a dry spell with little rain and high temperatures, requiring attention to water storage and drought relief. This year, typhoons have frequently made landfall, and coastal areas must be prepared for typhoon prevention and disaster relief.

    通报汛情灾情和天气
    本报北京7月18日讯　记者肖俊熙从水利部和国家气象局举行的新闻发布会获悉：我国前阶段防汛抗旱取得初步胜利，大江大河堤防安全，北方旱情缓解。有关部门指出，目前已进入大汛期间，必须提高警惕，克服松劲麻痹思想，全力以赴，奋战一个多月，争取防汛抗旱斗争胜利，为稳定大局和农业丰收做贡献。
    入夏以来，我国南方大雨、暴雨频繁，洪涝偏重，由于各级领导及早抓防汛抗洪，责任、措施落实，水利部门精心调度，大江大河没有出现大问题。但局部地区由于暴雨来势猛，强度大，范围广，持续时间长，引起山洪、山体滑坡等多种自然灾害，造成一定损失。夏旱在北方一些地区一度较严重，由于水利设施发挥作用，又有两次大范围适时降雨，大部分地区旱情基本解除，秋熟作物长势较好。
    7月下旬到8月上旬是我国的大汛期，历史上的大洪水大都发生在这期间，黄、淮、海、辽河流域往往三两天集中暴雨就可能出现较大洪水。据气象预测，7月下旬我国可能出现南北两条主雨带，北方主雨带位于东北的东部和南部、华北的东部、南部，雨量比常年同期显著偏多；南方雨带位于华南和西南东部，其中闽、粤沿海雨量比常年偏多。8月份华北、东北大部和黄河流域降雨将增多。因此，各地必须充分做好迎战更大洪水的准备，按照国务院批准的长江、黄河、淮河、永定河特大洪水防御方案的规定，做好各项万无一失的准备。这期间，南方广大地区将有一段伏旱期，少雨，高温，要注意蓄水和防旱、抗旱。今年台风登陆频繁，沿海各地要注意防台抗灾。
