The All-China Federation of Rural Sports held a national work conference from July 17 to 19 in Beijing to discuss how to further develop rural sports activities. The conference decided that the second National Farmers' Games will be held in October 1992 in Xiaogan, Hubei.

Wang Renhe, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Honorary Chairman of the All-China Federation of Rural Sports, attended the conference. He made important remarks on rural sports work during the conference and before the meeting when he listened to reports. He pointed out that without rural sports, the direction would be wrong! Gold medals must be won, but mass sports must also be vigorously promoted. Otherwise, how can farmers' physical fitness be improved? Now, some people pursue gold medals solely. In domestic and international competitions, if they cannot win gold medals, it is a big deal. Of course, gold medals are still needed; they represent the level of sports, but they should not be pursued at the expense of mass sports. The purpose of sports should be clear, and the promotion of sports and popularization should be well combined. In rural areas, sports play a role in enhancing farmers' physical fitness and cultivating their moral qualities, which are important for occupying the ideological battlefield in rural areas and building a spiritually and materially civilized society. Wang Renhe specially mentioned that rural sports activities should pay attention to the principles of local conditions and voluntary participation of the masses. When talking about the Farmers' Games, he emphasized that genuine farmers' athletes must participate, and there should be no cheating or championism.

This conference also studied the setting of competition projects for the second Farmers' Games, initially deciding to set up 9 major projects: track and field, basketball, table tennis, cycling, Chinese chess, Chinese wrestling, militia three-item, wushu, and swimming. Additionally, rope pulling is planned to be included as a sub-item in track and field. The above projects are all popular and widely practiced among farmers.

Xiao Peng, He Zhenliang, and other relevant responsible comrades also attended the conference and made speeches.

    中国农民体协召开全国工作会议
    王任重说，坚持两点论，不能单纯为金牌
    本报北京7月19日讯　记者刘小明报道：以商讨农村体育活动如何进一步开展的中国农民体协工作会议，7月17日至19日在北京召开。会议确定第二届全国农民运动会于1992年10月在湖北孝感举行。
    全国政协副主席、中国农民体协名誉主席王任重出席了会议。他在会上和会前听取汇报时就农村体育工作等问题发表了重要意见。他指出，不搞农民体育，方向就错啦！金牌要去夺，群众体育也要大力搞。不然农民的体质怎么提高？现在，有人单纯追求金牌，在国内外比赛中，拿不了金牌就不得了。当然，金牌还是要的，它代表体育运动的水平，但不能脱离群众体育而只顾抓一头、单纯强调金牌，要明确体育的目的，把提高与普及很好地结合起来。在农村，体育具有增强农民体质、培养农民道德品质的作用，是占领农村思想阵地、建设两个文明的重要内容。王任重特别提到，农村开展体育活动要注意因地制宜和群众自愿的原则。在谈到农民运动会时，他强调说，一定要是真正的农民运动员参加，不准弄虚作假，锦标主义。
    这次会议还研究了第二届农运会比赛项目的设置，初步确定设9个大项目：田径、篮球、乒乓球、自行车、象棋、中国式摔跤、民兵三项、武术和游泳。另外，准备把拔河作为田径中的一个小项目。上述这些项目均是农民喜闻乐见、开展较为普及的群体项目。
    肖鹏、何振梁等有关负责同志也参加了会议并作了讲话。
