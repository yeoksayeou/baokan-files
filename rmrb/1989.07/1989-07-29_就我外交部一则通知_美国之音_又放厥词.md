	Regarding a Notice from Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "Voice of America" Speaks Out Again

	New China News Agency, Beijing, July 29 (Reporter Xín Huáishí) An official from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Information Department confirmed today that a report by "Voice of America" distorted the facts.

	"Voice of America" broadcasted on July 28 that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced an indefinite suspension of regular press conferences but did not announce the reason for the suspension. However, the notice we received states: "Considering the hot weather and vacation period in July and August, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' spokesperson will suspend weekly press conferences starting July 27. Telephone inquiries will continue as usual. The resumption of press conferences will be announced separately." After verifying with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Information Department, the notice sent to foreign news agencies in Beijing is exactly the same.

	Local officials believe that obviously, this unnamed reporter's report from "Voice of America" intentionally distorted the facts. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly announced the reason for the temporary suspension of regular press conferences, but "Voice of America" claimed there was no announced reason. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs clearly stated "temporary suspension," but "Voice of America" insisted on changing it to "indefinite suspension." The intentions behind "Voice of America" engaging in such petty tricks are worth pondering.

### 就我外交部一则通知  “美国之音”又放厥词

    就我外交部一则通知
    “美国之音”又放厥词
    新华社北京七月二十九日电  （记者辛怀时）外交部新闻司官员今天证实，“美国之音”的一则报道歪曲事实。
      “美国之音”七月二十八日广播说，中国外交部宣布无限期停止定期新闻发布会，但没有宣布停止的原因。而本社接到的有关通知是说：“鉴于七、八月份天气炎热，且是度假时期，外交部发言人每星期的新闻发布会从七月二十七日起暂停。电话答问照常进行。发布会何时恢复将另行通知”。经向外交部新闻司核对，该司向外国驻京新闻机构的通知是完全一样的。
    此间人士认为，显然，“美国之音”这则未注明记者姓名的报道是有意歪曲事实。明明是外交部宣布了暂时停止定期新闻发布会的原因，美国之音却说是“没有宣布停止的原因”；外交部宣布的明明是“暂停”，“美国之音”却硬要改成“无限期停止”。“美国之音”搞这种小动作，目的何在是耐人寻味的。
