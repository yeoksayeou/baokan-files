	The Secret to Success
	—A Record of Beijing Municipal Construction Company Five Manager Tong Yonggui
	Wang Xiaoyi

	Established for only a few years, they have repeatedly won in the fiercely competitive construction industry.

	Beijing Municipal Construction Company Five has undertaken a large number of high-quality projects: the first modern theater in China—the China Theater, which was rated as one of the top ten buildings in Beijing in the 1980s; the China Rehabilitation Research Center, which is praised as a “first-class project”… In late 1987, the first bidding project in Beijing—a Sino-foreign joint venture, the Oriental Art Building—was won by them; in September 1988, they defeated three competitors to undertake the international aid project—the “Youth House” in Tunisia… Last year, this company was rated by the People's Construction Bank as a “first-class credit, first-class enterprise.” Many construction units specifically requested them to undertake engineering projects.

	Do they have some secret? Manager Tong Yonggui said: “These achievements are mainly won by us through good project quality and reputation, and to achieve these, we must have a good team of workers to ensure it, the key is to improve the quality of the people.”

	The 48-year-old Tong Yonggui became the company manager in 1984. He has a long-term strategic vision and attaches great importance to the cultivation of talents and the improvement of the overall quality of the workforce. Over the past five years, the company has allocated more than 200,000 yuan annually for intellectual investment. A total of 278 people from the company have been sent to various colleges and universities for further study. The company has also organized various training classes in different trades and levels, totaling more than 220 sessions, with over 10,000 people receiving training.

	With the improvement of workers' technical skills, the quality of the projects has a reliable guarantee. This also promoted the technological progress of the enterprise and the improvement of project quality. Over the past five years, the company has implemented more than 200 technological transformations and innovations, creating economic benefits of more than 100 million yuan.

	Tong Yonggui values the role of talents, making the workers feel that as long as they have the ability, they have a place to show their skills in this company. Tong Yonggui has a catchphrase: “Use whoever has the ability.” Those cadres who have some flaws and shortcomings but have management experience, he also dares to appoint.

	There was a technician who, after becoming a foreman, was once very passive in his work. Someone suggested replacing him. Manager Tong thought that this foreman had good technical and professional qualities, and his work was not progressing mainly because of lack of experience, not because he was unwilling to work, so he should be cultivated and helped. Later, after a period of exploration and summary, this foreman's work improved significantly and has now become a backbone of the production line.

	Because Manager Tong values the role of people's skills, the whole company has formed a trend of learning technology and business. Some workers not only participate in various study classes organized by the company but also use their spare time to participate in some professional studies organized by society.

    成功的秘诀
    ——记北京市城建五公司经理佟永贵
    王效玉
    成立还没有几年，可他们却在竞争激烈的建筑业中连连取胜。
    北京市城建五公司承建了一大批优质工程：我国第一座现代化剧场——中国剧院，被评为北京80年代十大建筑之一；中国康复研究中心，被誉为“一流的工程”……1987年底，北京市第一项招标项目——中外合资的东方艺术大厦，由他们中标；1988年9月，他们战胜三家对手承包了国际援助项目——突尼斯“青年之家”……去年，这家公司被国家建设银行评定为“一级信誉、一等企业”。不少建设单位点名要他们承建工程项目。
    难道他们有什么秘诀吗？公司经理佟永贵说：“这些，主要是我们靠好的工程质量和信誉去赢得的，而要做到这些，必须有一支好的职工队伍来保证，关键在于提高人的素质。”
    今年48岁的佟永贵于1984年当上了公司经理。他有着长远的战略眼光，非常重视人才的培养和整个职工队伍素质的提高。5年来，公司每年都拿出20多万元用于智力投资。全公司先后有278人被送到各大中专院校学习深造。公司还分工种分层次举办了各类培训班220多期，一万多人次受到培训。
    职工提高了技术水平，工程质量就有了可靠的保证。并且还促进了企业的技术进步和工程质量的提高，5年来，全公司实现技术改造、技术革新200多项，创经济效益100多万元。
    佟永贵重视发挥人才的作用，使职工们感到在这个公司只要有本事就有用武之地。佟永贵有一句口头禅：“谁有本事就用谁。”那些虽然有一些毛病、缺点的干部，但有管理经验，他也大胆启用。
    有一名技术员担任工长后，工作一度很被动，有人建议撤换他。佟经理认为，这名工长技术业务素质都可以，工作上不去，主要是经验不足，不是他不愿意干，应加强培养帮助。后来，这名工长通过一段时间摸索总结，工作有了很大起色，现在已成为生产一线的骨干。
    由于佟经理重视发挥人的一技之长，全公司学技术、学业务形成风气，一些职工不仅参加公司举办的各类学习班，还利用业余时间参加社会上的一些专业学习。
