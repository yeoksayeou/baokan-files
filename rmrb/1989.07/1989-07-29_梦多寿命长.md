Why do people need to dream? What happens if one does not dream? Scientists have conducted numerous experiments to deprive people of their dreams, waking them up as soon as they show brain waves indicative of dreaming. Repeating this process, they found that depriving people of dreams leads to a series of physiological abnormalities, such as increased pulse, blood pressure, body temperature, and skin electrical responses, as well as weakened autonomic nervous system functions. Additionally, it causes a series of adverse psychological reactions, including tension, anxiety, irritability, memory impairment, hallucinations, and disorientation. Clearly, dreaming has become a normal and indispensable physiological process for the human body. Normal dreaming activities are an important factor in ensuring the normal functioning of the body.

Researchers at Yamanashi University in Japan discovered two types of opposing sleep-inducing peptides in the human brain: one induces dreamless sleep, and the other induces dreaming sleep. They successfully isolated the dreaming sleep-inducing peptide and applied it to animals, extending their dreaming sleep period. As a result, the average lifespan of the experimental animals significantly increased.

    梦多寿命长
    人为什么要做梦？不做梦会有什么反应？科学家做了很多剥夺人的梦的实验，即当睡眠者一出现做梦的脑电波时，就立即被唤醒，如此反复进行。结果发现，对梦的剥夺，会导致人体一系列生理异常，如脉搏、血压、体温以及皮肤电反应均增加，植物神经系统机能有所减弱。同时，还会引起人的心理一系列不良反应，如紧张、焦虑、易怒、记忆障碍、出现幻觉、定向障碍等。显然，做梦已成为人体的一种正常的必不可少的生理过程。正常的梦境活动，成为保证肌体正常生命活动的重要因素之一。
    日本山梨大学研究人员发现人脑中存在着两类相反的催眠肽，一类催无梦睡眠，另一类催有梦睡眠。他们成功地分离出催有梦眠肽，将它施于动物，使其睡眠的有梦期延长，结果实验动物的平均寿命大大提高。　（7月16日《中国体育报》泰生文）
