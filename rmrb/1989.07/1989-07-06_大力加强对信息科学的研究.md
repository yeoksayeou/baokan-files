In modern society, information has become a unique factor of production. With the advancement of science and technology, information is increasingly becoming an important resource. Unlike material and energy, which are two types of resources, information resources do not provide the world with materials or power, but rather knowledge. The special role of this "soft resource" lies in increasing the utility of "hard resources" such as materials and energy, and improving the efficiency of human activities. If hard resources are non-renewable and limited, then soft resources are infinite and can be regenerated and even self-generated.

Information has become a factor of production or productivity. Whether it is the object of labor, means of labor, labor force, or the combination of the three, it is increasingly inseparable from the role of information. The exploration and processing of the object of labor, the improvement and transformation of the means of labor, all rely on information and its application. The quality of the labor force is more fundamentally determined by intelligence, that is, the information-related conditions that the laborer possesses, such as experience, skills, knowledge, and wisdom. Information is also reflected in the technology and management of production. Information that is attached to and permeates other factors of production gradually becomes independent and becomes a unique factor of production. In an agricultural society, the most important factor of production is land; in an industrial society, the most important factor of production is capital and labor; while in an information society, the most important factor of production is information, that is, knowledge or intelligence.

Due to the increasing importance of information in economic and social development, governments of various countries are rushing to build information systems. Information systems characterized by the combination of electronic computers and remote communication are designed to serve the scientific and modern management. Every country, department, region, and enterprise is establishing its own management information system to perform the function of a "nervous system." The development of information system networks around the world has pushed human communication and cooperation to a new stage.

In the development of information and information systems, statistical information and statistical information systems occupy an important position. Statistical information reflects the overall situation of national economic and social development, but it is not the "main body" of social and economic information. In addition to statistical information, there is also planning information, accounting information, various business accounting information, and non-accounting market information, decision-making information, etc. Statistical information is a type of numerical information. In addition to numerical information, there is textual information and image information, of which textual information accounts for more than 2/3 of all information. Statistical information is also a type of post-event information. In addition to post-event information, there is current dynamic information reflecting the present situation and predictive information indicating future changes, and post-event information at most accounts for 1/3 of all information. Therefore, statistical information is only a specific part of social and economic information. The relationship between information and statistical information is a relationship of generality and specificity, whole and part.

The information system of modern society has formed an independent sector. The process of collecting, processing, storing, transmitting, and managing information, that is, the entire process of information processing, is the content of narrow information work. Due to the increasing amount of information in modern society and the increasing complexity of information, manual information processing methods can no longer meet the needs and are gradually developing towards computerization. Broadly speaking, information work is the production and distribution of information products or services. In this sense, scientific research (production of knowledge), education (transmission of knowledge), publishing (distribution of information), as well as news, broadcasting, libraries, archives, etc., all belong to information work. The construction of information systems to provide information products or services in a timely, efficient, and high-quality manner is also an important part of information work. The scope of information work can be further expanded to activities that provide technical support for the production and dissemination of information, such as the manufacture of electronic computers and communication equipment. Although the results of these activities are not information products, they are the foundation for the production of information products.

The development of social division of labor has separated economic activities from social activities and has also separated information activities from economic and social activities, forming an independent information work sector. There is a class of information departments that are completely independent, and their work results have taken the form of commodities, such as the information consulting service industry and the data communication industry. There is also a class of information departments that are dependent on non-information departments, and their work results do not take the form of commodities, but the content and methods of their work are still relatively independent, such as information institutions within the government and enterprises. The level of development of information departments is an important indicator of a country's economic and technological development. In 1982, the part of China's national income created by information activities accounted for only 15%, while developed countries generally exceeded 50%. In the same year, the proportion of information workers in China's total labor force was only 8.8%, while in developed countries it was generally 50-55%.

Statistical work observes a large number of objective things, collects, organizes, processes, and analyzes data on the quantitative aspects of the whole, and submits statistical reports to serve planning, decision-making, and management. Therefore, this is a kind of information work. However, information work is not limited to statistical work, and its scope is much broader than statistical work. China's statistical work has a long history and has developed rapidly, especially since the more than ten years of reform and opening up, it has entered a period of prosperity. However, China's overall information work, due to the lack of strategic recognition of its importance, is still backward compared to other countries. For example, compared with India, they established the National Information Center 10 years earlier than China, and the number of scientists and staff in this center is 2.5 times that of China. Due to the development of the information industry, the task of establishing information industry statistics has been put forward to the statistical department, and the construction of a nationwide unified information system has provided the possibility and material guarantee for the automation of the statistical information system; on the other hand, the development of statistical work also provides other information departments with more and better statistical data for use.

Information science takes information issues as its research object, originating from the late 19th century's research on communication issues. In the 1940s, Shannon of the United States established information theory, which is the narrow sense of information science. It studies the measurement methods and transmission principles of information, and is essentially still a communication theory. Information science is the broad sense of information theory. It is different from Shannon's information theory in that it not only studies the grammatical (formal) aspects of information but also studies the semantic (content) and pragmatic (effect) aspects of information. In the study of grammatical information, it not only studies the random factors in uncertainty but also studies the fuzzy and accidental factors. The identification, extraction, representation, transformation, storage, transmission, processing, control, and utilization of information are all contents of information science research. The purpose of information science is to recognize the system (object) through obtaining information from the system and to transform the system through the feedback of information, so as to optimize it. Under certain conditions, the ability to successfully use information to achieve a certain goal is what is often referred to as intelligence. Intelligent science is an important branch of information science. Information models and information methods (methods for analyzing and synthesizing information) are effective scientific methodologies, applicable to the study of various problems.

Statistical science is a completely different science from information science. Statistical science is divided into mathematical statistics and social and economic statistics. The former is based on probability theory and the law of large numbers, using sampling methods to infer the characteristics of the whole from the observed sample data. The latter is based on economic principles to statistically observe and calculate the quantitative relationships of social and economic phenomena. The emergence and development of statistical science preceded information science. The emergence of information science was a mid-20th-century event, about two to three hundred years later than statistical science, and it is still not mature, and its boundaries are still controversial.

However, there is still some connection between information science and statistical science. This connection is reflected in the historical role of mathematical statistical methods in the development of information theory. Probability theory, as an important branch of mathematics, was introduced into statistical research and produced mathematical statistics in statistical science. It was introduced into information research and produced the initial form of information science, information theory. Any science that is completely different often has astonishing similarities. This is precisely the point of connection in the scientific genealogy.

    大力加强对信息科学的研究
    乌家培
    现代社会中，信息已成为独特的生产要素
    随着科技进步，信息日益变成重要的资源。与物质、能量这两种资源不同，信息资源向世界提供的不是材料或动力，而是知识。这种“软资源”的特殊作用在于增大物质、能量之类“硬资源”的效用，提高人类活动的效率。如果说硬资源不能再生，是有限的，那么软资源却是无限的，可以不断再生，甚至自生。
    信息已成为生产或生产力的要素。无论劳动对象、劳动资料、劳动力，还是三者的结合，越来越离不开信息的作用。劳动对象的发掘与加工、劳动资料的改进与变革，要依靠信息及其运用。劳动力的素质更主要地决定于智力，即劳动者具备的经验、技巧、知识、智慧等信息方面的条件。信息还体现在生产中的科技与管理上。依附于和渗透在其他生产要素的信息，逐渐游离出来，而成为独特的生产要素。农业社会最重要的生产要素是土地，工业社会最重要的生产要素是资金和劳力，而信息社会最重要的生产要素则是信息，即知识或智力。
    由于信息在经济和社会发展中的重要性越来越明显，各国政府纷纷建设信息系统。以电子计算机与远程通信相结合为特点的信息系统，是为管理的科学化和现代化服务的。每个国家、部门、地区、企业都在建立自己的管理信息系统，使其发挥“神经”系统的功能。信息系统网络在全世界的发展，把人类相互间的交流与合作推进到一个崭新的阶段。
    在信息与信息系统的发展过程中，统计信息与统计信息系统占居着重要的地位。统计信息所反映的是国民经济和社会发展的总体情况，但并非社会经济信息的“主体”。在全部社会经济信息中，除统计信息外，还有与它相并列的计划信息、会计信息、各种业务核算信息，以及非核算的市场信息、决策信息，等等。统计信息是一种数字信息。除数字信息外，还有文字信息、图象信息等，其中文字信息约占全部信息的2／3以上。统计信息又是一种事后信息。除事后信息外，还有反映当前动态的现状信息和说明未来变化的预测信息，事后信息充其量只占全部信息的1／3。所以，统计信息只是社会经济信息的一个特定部分。信息与统计信息的关系，是一般与特殊、整体与局部的关系。
    现代社会信息系统已形成独立部门
    对信息进行收集、加工、存贮、传递、管理，即信息处理全过程，是狭义的信息工作的内容。由于现代社会信息量激增，信息的复杂程度不断加大，信息处理的人工方式已不能适应需要，正在逐步向电脑化方向发展。广义的信息工作，是生产和分配信息产品或服务的活动。按这种理解，科研（生产知识）、教育（传授知识）、出版（分配信息），以及新闻、广播、图书馆、档案库等工作，都属于信息工作。为了多快好省地提供信息产品或服务而进行的信息系统建设，也是信息工作的重要内容。信息工作的外延，还可扩大到为生产和传播信息提供技术支持的活动，如电子计算机、通信设备等的制造工作。这类活动的成果虽非信息产品，但是信息产品的生产基础。
    社会劳动分工的发展，使经济活动从社会活动中分离出来，还使信息活动从经济活动和社会活动中分离出来，形成独立的信息工作部门。有一类信息部门是完全独立的，其工作成果已采取商品形态，如信息咨询服务业、数据通信业，等等。还有一类信息部门依存于非信息部门内，其工作成果不采取商品形态，但工作的内容和方式还是相对独立的，如政府、企业内部的信息机构。信息部门的发达程度是衡量一国经济和科技发展水平的重要标志。1982年我国国民生产总值中由信息活动创造的部分只占15％，而发达国家一般超过50％，同年我国劳动就业总人数中信息工作者只占8.8％，而发达国家一般为50—55％。
    统计工作对客观事物进行大量观察，就其总体的数量方面的资料，进行收集、整理加工、分析研究，提出统计报告，为计划、决策和管理服务。所以，这是一种信息工作。但是，信息工作不限于统计工作，其范围远比统计工作广泛。我国的统计工作历史久、发展快，尤其是从改革、开放十年多以来，进入了一个繁荣时期。但是，我国的整个信息工作，由于未从战略高度来认识它的重要性，与其他国家相比还是落后的。例如，与印度相比，他们建立国家信息中心，比我国早10年，这个中心的科学家和职员人数，比我国多2.5倍。由于信息事业的发展，向统计部门提出了建立信息产业统计的任务，而全国统一的信息系统的建设，则为统计信息系统自动化提供了可能性和物质保障；反过来，统计工作的发展，也使其他信息部门有数量更多质量更好的统计资料可供利用。
    深入开展信息科学的研究
    信息科学以信息问题为研究对象，起源于19世纪末对通信问题的研究，20世纪40年代，美国的申农创立了信息论，这是狭义的信息科学，它研究信息的度量方法与传递原理，实质上还是一种通信理论。信息科学则是广义的信息论，它与申农信息论不同，不仅研究信息的语法（形式）方面的因素，还研究信息的语义（内容）和语用（效应）方面的因素，而在语法信息的研究中，不仅研究不确定性中的随机因素，还研究模糊因素和偶发因素。信息的识别、提取、表示、变换、存贮、传递、加工、控制和利用等问题，都是信息科学研究的内容。信息科学的宗旨在于通过获取系统（事物）的信息来认识系统，和借助信息对系统的反作用来改造系统，使其优化。在一定条件下，为达到某种目标成功地利用信息的能力，就是常说的智能。智能论是信息科学的一个重要分支。信息模型和信息方法（对信息进行分析和综合的方法），是有效的科学方法论，适用于各种问题的研究。
    统计科学是与信息科学完全不同的另一门科学。统计科学有数理统计学与社会经济统计学之分。前者以概率论和大数定律为基础，采用抽样法，根据观察的样本资料推断总体特征。后者以经济学原理为基础，对社会经济现象的数量关系进行统计观察和统计计算。统计科学的产生和发展早于信息科学。而信息科学的问世，则是本世纪中叶的事情，比统计科学要晚二三百年，而且至今仍未成熟，它的边界如何确定尚有争论。
    但是，信息科学与统计科学之间还是有某种联系的。这种联系表现在数理统计方法对信息论产生的历史作用上。概率论作为数学的一个重要分支，引入于统计研究后，产生了统计科学中的数理统计学，引入于信息研究后，又产生了信息科学的初始形态信息论。任何迥异的科学，往往存在着惊人的类同之处。这正是科学谱系的连结点之所在。
