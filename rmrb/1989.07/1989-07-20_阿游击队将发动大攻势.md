Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, July 19th.

Afghan guerrilla forces are preparing to launch a major offensive against Kabul and Kandahar in early August, according to Afghan guerrilla sources. This decision comes in response to the United States' agreement to supply the guerrillas with anti-aircraft weapons.

The sources said the first phase of their offensive will target major airports controlled by the Afghan government, aiming to neutralize the air force of the Kabul regime. The Afghan Air Force poses the greatest threat to the guerrillas. Due to heavy bombing by Kabul's aircraft, the guerrillas' attack on Jalalabad in March this year was unsuccessful.

    阿游击队将发动大攻势
    新华社伊斯兰堡7月19日电　据阿富汗游击队人士今天说，鉴于美国答应给游击队提供防空武器，他们准备在下月初向喀布尔和坎大哈发动重大攻势。
    游击队人士说，他们攻势的第一阶段是袭击阿富汗政府控制的主要机场，使喀布尔政权空军失去战斗力。
    阿富汗空军对游击队构成最大威胁。由于喀布尔飞机的狂轰滥炸，今年3月，游击队攻打贾拉拉巴德城未获成功。
