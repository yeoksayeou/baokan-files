The Anhui Provincial Government made a decision on July 28 to disband the Jianghuai Kanghua Development Company, Huawan Industrial (Group) Company, and the Provincial Economic and Technological Development Company, all of which have faced significant public criticism.

The decision states that after a thorough review and rectification, it was found that these three companies have varying degrees of illegal operations. Some have no clear economic benefits, while others have chaotic management, resulting in economic losses for the state. After the dissolution of these companies, relevant departments will form a post-liquidation team to handle personnel, financial, and asset-related matters. The external economic contracts and debts of Huawan Company will be transferred to the Anhui International Economic and Technological Cooperation Company for settlement.

The Anhui Provincial Government has decided that after the dissolution of these three companies, efforts will continue to thoroughly investigate the issues and handle them strictly in accordance with relevant policies and laws.

    安徽撤销清查三公司
    新华社合肥7月30日电　安徽省人民政府28日作出决定，撤销群众意见比较强烈的江淮康华开发公司、华皖实业（集团）公司和省经济技术开发公司。
    安徽省政府的决定说，经清理整顿，江淮康华开发公司、华皖实业（集团）公司、省经济技术开发公司，都程度不同地存在着违法经营等问题，有的无明显经济效益，有的经营管理混乱，给国家造成经济损失。上述三个公司撤销后，有关部门将组成善后清理小组，处理人、财、物等事宜。华皖公司原签订的对外经济合同和债权债务，转给中国安徽国际经济技术合作公司承担。
    安徽省政府决定，上述三个公司撤销后，将继续组织力量彻底查清，并依照有关政策和法律严肃处理。
