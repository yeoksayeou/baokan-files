	Philippine President Corazon Aquino said today in Manila that her government is studying the proposal by the National Democratic Front of the Philippines to resume talks and expressed her willingness to engage in a new round of peace talks with the armed wing of the Philippine Communist Party, the New People's Army.

	The New People's Army, on July 23, issued a statement through the National Democratic Front, saying that as long as the President guarantees the withdrawal of U.S. military bases after 1991, the New People's Army will resume talks with the government. Aquino's remarks were in response to this statement.

	The Philippine Senate unanimously agreed to resume talks with the New People's Army, but with different conditions.

	Senator Santanina Rasul, chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said the President must consult with Congress before making a guarantee to withdraw U.S. military bases. However, Rasul added that she personally favors a gradual withdrawal of U.S. military bases.

	Opposition Senator Jovito Salonga said the New People's Army's "proposal is welcome," and criticized Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos for insisting that the New People's Army lay down their arms as a condition for resuming talks, calling it "unworkable."

	However, the Philippine military firmly opposes talks with the New People's Army and warned that the New People's Army's proposal for talks is a "trap."

	The Aquino government had begun talks with the New People's Army on August 5, 1986, but further negotiations broke down, leading the New People's Army to resume armed struggle.

    科·阿基诺总统表示
    愿与菲共恢复和谈
    菲军方表示反对
    新华社马尼拉7月25日电　菲律宾总统科拉松·阿基诺今天在此间说，她的政府正在研究菲律宾全国民主阵线提出的恢复谈判的建议，并表示愿意与菲律宾共产党的武装组织新人民军进行新的一轮和平谈判。
    新人民军23日通过全国民主阵线发表声明说，只要总统保证美国军事基地在1991年之后撤走，新人民军将与政府重开谈判。科·阿基诺就是针对这一声明而发表上述讲话的。
    菲律宾参议院一致赞成与新人民军恢复谈判，但是谈判的条件有所不同。
    菲参议院对外关系委员会主席沙哈尼说，总统必须与国会协商后才能作出要美国撤走军事基地的保证。但是沙哈尼又说，她本人更倾向于要美国逐步撤走军事基地。
    菲律宾反对党参议员恩里莱说，新人民军的“建议令人高兴”，并称菲国防部长拉莫斯把“新人民军放下武器”作为政府与之恢复谈判的条件是“行不通的”。
    然而，菲军方却坚决反对与新人民军谈判，并警告说，新人民军要求谈判的建议是一个“圈套”。
    科·阿基诺政府曾于1986年8月5日与新人民军开始会谈，但后来因双方进一步谈判破裂，新人民军又开始了武装斗争。
