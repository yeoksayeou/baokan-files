The U.S. Secretary of State, James Baker, departed Washington today for a one-week tour of Asia to promote his "New Pacific Partnership" concept.

Last week, Baker, in a speech to the Asian community in New York, stated that the purpose of his visit was to establish a framework for the "New Pacific Partnership" relationship.

Baker also mentioned that he would discuss in detail the possibility of establishing this mechanism during his meetings with leaders in the region.

Baker's first stop will be in Tokyo, Japan, where he will attend a multilateral meeting to discuss providing aid to the Philippines. It is reported that the United States and other donor countries will formulate a five-year aid plan for the Philippines, which includes providing $1 billion in economic aid and an equal amount in private investment annually. Subsequently, Baker will travel to Brunei to meet with ministers from ASEAN countries attending the annual ASEAN meeting.

After concluding his Asian tour, Baker will fly to Warsaw to accompany President Bush on his visits to Poland and Hungary.

    贝克开始亚洲之行
    新华社华盛顿7月3日电  美国国务卿贝克今天离开华盛顿开始为期一周的亚洲之行，以推销其“新太平洋合作伙伴”的构想。
    贝克国务卿上星期在纽约亚洲人社团发表讲话时曾表示，他此次出访的目的是要为“新太平洋合作伙伴”关系建立一个框架。
    贝克还说，他将在同该地区的领导人举行的会谈中，详细探讨有关建立这一机制的可能性。
    贝克首先将在日本东京出席一个多国会谈，讨论有关向菲律宾提供援助的问题。据悉，美国和其它一些捐资国家将制订一项援菲五年计划，其中包括每年向菲律宾提供10亿美元的经济援助和相同数目的私人投资。随后，贝克国务卿将前往文莱，会见在那里参加东盟国家年会的各国部长。
    在结束亚洲之行后，贝克国务卿将飞往华沙，陪同布什总统访问波兰和匈牙利。
