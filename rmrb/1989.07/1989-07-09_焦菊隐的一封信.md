While I was going through some old things, I came across a letter from Mr. Jiao Juhui. To explain the background of this letter, I need to start from the beginning. In the 1950s and 1960s, I had a lot of contact with playwrights, among whom Comrade Du Feng was one. He came to the People's Art Theatre to read his play "Long Live the Heroes." During the reading, he was very emotional and sometimes tears of excitement flowed down his face. The actors who listened to the reading were also deeply moved. After the reading, everyone applauded. The actress Hu Zongwen said, "Although this play does not have any female roles, we still support its production." Subsequently, I sought the opinion of Mr. Jiao Juhui, who wrote a very insightful letter right in front of me, also advocating for the rehearsal of this play. However, at that time, other leaders were not very interested in this play, so I reported the scene during the reading of the script along with Jiao's letter to the leadership. Under my repeated urging, they finally agreed to rehearse the play. Later, the performance received good reviews.

Mr. Jiao Juhui's letter was written as follows:

Mountain Respect, Xia Chun,

I read the script in one breath. I found it very good, and I am very excited. The soldiers are well-written. The commanders are also well-written. The commanders' strategic and tactical thinking, judgment, decisiveness, and reliance on the Party and "Zhuge Liang" are all well-portrayed. The role of the Party's leadership in the army is also well-written. However, the soldiers' language and some characters are a bit "intellectualized." The team leader's character is somewhat simplified and should also show his bravery and wisdom. He should also express his strategic thinking; he only has a bit of arrogance. But these are all easy to modify and do not require much effort. I personally advocate for the production of this play. Please make the final decision. Hurriedly,

Sincerely,
Jiao Juhui

    焦菊隐的一封信
    陈中宣
    在我翻东西的时候，翻出了焦菊隐先生的一封信。关于这信的来由还得从头说起。五、六十年代我与剧作家有不少联系，其中杜峰同志就是一个。他到人艺来读他写的《英雄万岁》，读时很激动，有时流出热泪来。听读剧本的演员，也一样受感动。读完后，大家都鼓掌，女演员胡宗温说：“这个戏虽然没有女同志的戏，但我们也支持上演。”随后我向焦菊隐先生征求意见，他当着我写了一封颇为精采的信，也主张排练这个戏。但那时别的领导同志对这戏的兴趣不太大，于是我便以读剧本时的情景连同焦的信向领导反映，在我一再催促下，才答应排练这个戏。后来演出得到好评。
    焦菊隐先生的信是这样写的：山尊、夏淳同志：
    剧本我一口气看完了。觉得很好，我很兴奋。战士们写得不错。指挥员也写得不错，指挥员们的战略战术思想、判断、果断和依靠党、依靠“诸葛亮”的优良性格和品质，也都写出了。党的领导在部队的作用，也写得好。只是战士的语言，一些人物还多少“知识分子化”了一些。团长的性格，简单化了一些，应当也有他的勇敢与智谋，应当也表现一下他的战略思想，他只是有了一点骄傲。但这些都好修改，而且不太费力。我个人主张排这个戏。请你们作最后决定。匆匆
                即致敬礼！
