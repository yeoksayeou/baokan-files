The golden sickle and hammer, the shining military flags and emblems, intertwine with magnificent hymns to create a dazzling brilliance. On the occasion of the 68th anniversary of the Party, the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army organized a singing festival to celebrate July 1st for the capital's martial law troops and the PLA and armed police forces stationed in Beijing. At this time, the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital has achieved decisive victory, and the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee has concluded successfully. The hearts of the people are filled with the warmth of spring, and the soldiers' voices are even more resonant.

This was an unprecedented and heart-stirring event. Party and state leaders, high-ranking military officials of our army, came among the soldiers to celebrate the victory together, singing to the Party and the motherland. The soldiers were greatly inspired and filled with passion. "Majestic Mount Jinggang, the red flag of August 1st..." The entire audience of over 3,000 officers and soldiers sang loudly, "The People's Army is Loyal to the Party." This familiar and affectionate melody expressed the soldiers' unwavering love and loyalty to the Party. Yesterday, in the long, dark night of storms, it was the Communist Party that founded the people's army, leading countless revolutionary sons and daughters through the years of blood and fire to establish the People's Republic; today, on the vast land of China, only the Communist Party can lead us to seize new victories on the road to a strong and hopeful nation! This was like a glorious parade. The officers and soldiers of the capital's martial law troops, the PLA and armed police forces stationed in Beijing, with a mountain-like formation and a sea-like momentum, took turns singing "The August 1st Flag Flies High" and other songs, expressing the sublime principle of "the Party commands the gun" and the filial piety of "serving the people."

In this disciplined formation, the contingent of representatives from the capital's martial law troops stood out. They wore steel helmets, tightly fastened belts, green uniforms, and white gloves, looking dignified and spirited, earning the enthusiastic applause of their fellow soldiers. During the execution of the martial law in the capital, the songs always inspired and encouraged the soldiers. Yang Baibing, Director of the General Political Department, once personally directed the soldiers to sing "Learning from Lei Feng is a Good Example." Subsequently, the General Political Department recommended 16 songs about revolutionary traditions and the army's mission to the martial law troops and printed them as loose-leaf song sheets for distribution. They were required to display the glorious image of the army as a mighty and civilized force with their resonant voices, disciplined appearance, high morale, and iron discipline to the people of the capital. This time, they sang "I Love My Beautiful Title," "Learning from Lei Feng is a Good Example," "I Carry the Gun for the People," "I am a Soldier," and "The Army and the People March Forward Together," which brought people's thoughts back to the unforgettable days and nights not long ago. It was these lovely soldiers who, adhering to discipline, considering the overall situation, enduring hardships, and bravely sacrificing themselves, used their blood and lives to protect the People's Republic and added luster to the title of "People's Liberation Army."

Singers from the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe, General Political Department Opera Troupe, Friendship Song and Dance Troupe, Naval Political Department Song and Dance Troupe, Air Force Political Department Cultural Troupe, Second Artillery Cultural Troupe, and Armed Police Cultural Troupe gathered together to perform their best pieces. Over the past month, these singers formed dozens of performance teams, representing the three general departments, braving the scorching sun, enduring fatigue, and continuously traveling to various martial law troop stations to perform hundreds of shows, bringing the Party's care and warmth. Now, they are singing on stage with the soldiers. "Hymn to the Dear Party" is lively and passionate; "Mother Taught Me a Song" is heartfelt and touching; "Sing a Mountain Song for the Party" reminds people of the smiling military model Lei Feng. When the stage sang the familiar and simple song "I am a Soldier," the entire audience clapped and cheered. The stage and the audience were in a state of excitement.

On the ocean of singing voices, came the naval soldiers in their white naval uniforms, their heroic appearance, disciplined formation, and elegant performance were admirable. The armed police soldiers in olive green, with their dashing formation and uplifting melodies, showed the dignity of the shield and sword of the republic; the performance of the military band of the People's Liberation Army, adorned with golden sashes, made people recall the dawn of June 9th after the rain, and the scene of the flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square. The Red Army song "Three Disciplines and Eight Points for Attention" tells the simple philosophy of unity in victory; the solemn march and celebratory drumbeats once again vividly show: the People's Liberation Army is always the defender of the state, always the defender of socialism, and always the defender of the people's interests!

The thunderous and magnificent chorus of the entire audience, "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," pushed the emotions that had been building up to a climax. This is a declaration of truth, a historical warning, the road to light and happiness, and the unyielding belief of hundreds of millions of military and civilian people. The comrades in the audience sang together with the soldiers, so that this song would never fade away from generation to generation.

Under the bright red party flag and shining military emblem, gathered the representatives of the capital's martial law troops, the PLA and armed police forces stationed in Beijing, like countless stars surrounding the sun. They combined their voices and hearts into a symphony of the new era. This song will turn into the wind of July, echoing in the sky of the republic; it will turn into the footsteps of the soldiers, resonating on the path of modernization. Our troops march towards the sun, and we will forever sing to the sun!

    我们向着太阳歌唱
    ——记庆祝“七·一”歌咏大会
    孙军
    金色的镰刀斧头、闪亮的军旗军徽，在壮美的颂歌声中交织出灿烂的光辉。在党的第68个生日来临之际，解放军总政治部主办了首都戒严部队暨驻京陆海空军、武警部队庆“七·一”歌咏大会。此时正值平息首都反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利、党的十三届四中全会圆满闭幕，人们的心头鼓荡春风，战士的歌声更加嘹亮。
    这是一次盛况空前、震撼人心的大会。党和国家领导人、我军的高级将领来到了战士中间，共同欢庆胜利，歌唱党和祖国，战士备受鼓舞，激情澎湃。“雄伟的井冈山，八一军旗红……”全场3000多官兵放声高歌《人民军队忠于党》，这亲切而熟悉的旋律，抒发了战士对党始终不渝的热爱和忠贞。昨天，在风雨如磐的漫漫黑夜里，是共产党创建了人民军队，率领着多少革命儿女，穿过血与火的岁月，建立了人民的共和国；今天，在广袤的神州大地上，也只有共产党，才能率领我们在希望的强国之路上夺取新的胜利！这仿佛是一次光荣的阅兵，驻京陆海空军、武警部队的官兵，以山岳般的阵容、海潮般的气势，轮番引吭高歌《八一军旗高高飘扬》等歌曲，表达出“党指挥枪”的崇高原则，闪烁出“为人民服务”的赤子之心。
    在这严整的行列里，首都戒严部队官兵代表组成的方阵引人瞩目。他们头戴钢盔，紧束腰带，绿军衣、白手套，威风凛凛，英姿勃勃，赢得了战友们热烈的掌声。在执行首都戒严任务中，战歌始终鼓舞和激励着战士们。总政治部杨白冰主任在视察戒严部队时，曾亲自指挥官兵高歌《学习雷锋好榜样》。随后，总政治部又向戒严部队推荐了歌唱革命传统和我军宗旨的16首歌曲，并印制成活页歌片下发戒严部队，要求以嘹亮的歌声、严整的军容、昂扬的斗志、铁的纪律，向首都人民展示我军威武之师、文明之师的光辉形象。这次他们选唱的《我爱我的称呼美》、《学习雷锋好榜样》、《我为人民扛起枪》、《我是一个兵》、《军民团结向前进》，将人们的思绪又闪回到不久前那难以忘怀的日日夜夜。正是这些可爱的战士，遵守纪律、顾全大局、忍辱负重、慷慨赴死，用热血和生命保卫了人民共和国，为“人民子弟兵”称号增添光彩。
    来自总政歌舞团、总政歌剧团、战友歌舞团、海政歌舞团、空政文工团、二炮文工团、武警文工团的歌唱家们荟萃一堂，献上了他们最拿手的曲目。一个多月来，这些歌唱家们组成了几十个演出小分队，代表三总部，顶着骄阳，不顾疲劳，连续奔波在各戒严部队驻地，慰问演出数百场，带去了党的关怀和温暖。如今，他们又和战士们同台歌唱。《颂歌献给亲爱的党》载歌载舞、热烈奔放；《妈妈教我一支歌》情深意挚，动人心弦；《唱支山歌给党听》则使人想起了军中楷模雷锋的微笑。当场上唱起那亲切朴实的歌曲《我是一个兵》时，全场随拍击节，掌声阵阵。台上台下，一片沸腾。
    在歌声汇集的海洋上，走来了身着雪白的水兵服的海军战士军乐队，他们英武的仪表、整严的阵容、潇洒的演奏，令人赞叹不已。身着橄榄绿的武警部队战士军乐队的飒爽的队形、昂扬的旋律，显示出共和国盾牌、利剑的威严；肩披金色绶带的解放军军乐团的演奏，使人眼前浮现风雨过后的6月9日那个曙光初露的清晨，想起天安门广场升旗仪式的情景。那红军歌曲《三大纪律、八项注意》，在诉说着步调一致才能得胜利的平凡哲理；那庄重的进行曲和欢庆的锣鼓点，再次形象地表明：人民子弟兵永远是国家的捍卫者，永远是社会主义的捍卫者，永远是人民利益的捍卫者！
    排山倒海、气势磅礴的全场大合唱《没有共产党就没有新中国》，将人们蓄势已久的情感推向了高潮。这是真理的宣言、历史的忠告，这是通向光明幸福的胜利之路，也是亿万军民百折不挠的坚定信念。全场同志与战士们同声歌唱，为的是这歌声世世代代永不落。
    鲜艳的党旗、闪亮的军徽下，聚集着首都戒严部队、驻京陆海空军、武警部队的官兵代表，像无数的星座簇拥着太阳。他们用歌声和心声汇成了新时代的交响。这歌声将化作七月的风，在共和国的天空上回荡；将化作战士的足音，在现代化的征途上迸响。我们的队伍向太阳，我们永远向着太阳歌唱！
