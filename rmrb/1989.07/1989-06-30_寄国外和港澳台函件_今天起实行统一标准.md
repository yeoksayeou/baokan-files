The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' General Post Office recently issued a notice stating that starting from July 1, standardized procedures for international and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan mail items weighing 20 grams or less will be formally implemented. This is the first step in China's gradual implementation of international mail standards. Any letters or postcards that do not meet international standards will be returned to the sender by the receiving post office for additional postage or correction before being resubmitted.

Mail sent to foreign countries often passes through multiple postal systems and undergoes several sorting and transportation processes in two or more countries. To ensure the smooth and timely delivery of international mail, China's postal authorities have decided to gradually implement the unified standards set by the Universal Postal Union.

    寄国外和港澳台函件  今天起实行统一标准
    本报北京6月30日讯　记者赖仁琼报道：邮电部邮政总局日前发出公告，自7月1日起正式推行国际和港澳台20克以内函件的标准化。这是我国邮政逐步推行国际邮件标准化的第一步。凡不符合国际标准的信函、明信片，收寄局将退请寄件人补足邮费或更正后重新交寄。
    寄往国外的信件，需经两个或两个以上国家的邮政多个环节多次分拣、运输。为使国际邮件顺利传递、及时到达，我国邮政部门决定逐步推行万国邮政联盟制定的统一标准。
