Today in the afternoon, Premier Li Peng met with Yu Miyazaki, Chairman of the Daiwa Securities Economic Research Institute and member of the "Schmidt Committee," a renowned economist, at the Zhongnanhai Purple Light Pavilion.

Yu Miyazaki was entrusted by the "Schmidt Committee" to present a report to Premier Li Peng on behalf of the committee, addressing current global issues to various national leaders.

After listening to Yu Miyazaki's brief introduction, Premier Li Peng emphasized that China is a developing country with a large population and relatively scarce resources. Considering international factors, China can only follow the socialist path. If China were to adopt capitalism, it would only become a vassal of capitalist powers, inevitably leading to wealth disparity and social unrest. To truly make China prosperous and strong, it is necessary to implement the socialist system and formulate correct policies based on China's own national conditions.

Premier Li Peng said that China's decade of reform has brought significant benefits to the Chinese people. Effective policies from the reform and opening up, including those that introduce advanced technology, capital, and management experience, will not change.

Premier Li Peng said that some Western countries have imposed varying degrees of sanctions and pressure on China for suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot. One important reason is that they do not understand the true facts and have believed the false reports and rumors in the media. If a country's government bases its foreign policy on inaccurate, irresponsible reports, or even rumors, it would be dangerous. The Chinese Communist Party and government have repeatedly reiterated that they will adhere to the policy of reform and opening up. However, some in the international community attempt to exclude China from the international community, which is shortsighted and unwise.

Premier Li Peng continued, saying that the development of Sino-Japanese relations has been hard-won. We are pleased to see that many old friends and prominent figures in Japan, regarding the suppression of the riot in China, have prioritized Sino-Japanese friendship and taken a relatively fair stance, continuing to work towards Sino-Japanese friendship. I express my appreciation and gratitude for this.

Premier Li Peng asked Yu Miyazaki to convey to his Japanese friends that China's political situation is stable, the leadership core is united, and China will continue to adhere to reform and opening up, continuing to work towards Sino-Japanese friendly cooperation.

Yu Miyazaki said that the "Schmidt Committee" appreciates China's reform and opening up policy and hopes that China will actively participate in international economic activities.

### 李鹏会见日本客人宫崎勇时强调  中国只能走社会主义道路

    李鹏会见日本客人宫崎勇时强调
    中国只能走社会主义道路
    本报北京七月三日讯　今天下午，李鹏总理在中南海紫光阁会见了日本大和证券经济研究所理事长、“施密特委员会”成员、著名经济学家宫崎勇。
    宫崎勇是受“施密特委员会”的委托，来华向李鹏总理递交该委员会就当前全球性的问题致各国领导人的报告书。
    李鹏总理听取了宫崎勇的简要介绍后强调，中国是一个发展中的大国，人口众多、资源相对短缺，加上国际因素，中国只能走社会主义道路，如果中国实行资本主义，那只能变成资本主义大国的附庸，也必然会导致财富的两极分化，进而引起社会动荡。要使中国真正富强起来，就必须实行社会主义制度，根据中国自己的国情，制定正确的政策。
    李鹏总理说，中国十年改革为中国人民带来了很大益处，改革开放的一系列行之有效的政策，包括引进先进技术、资金和管理经验的政策，都不会改变。
    李鹏总理说，对我国平息反革命暴乱，西方有些国家对我国实行程度不同的制裁措施，施加压力，一条重要的原因，他们不了解事实真相，轻信了舆论的不真实报道和谣言，一个国家的政府如果把对外政策建立在不确切、不负责任的报道、甚至谣言上，那将是危险的。中国的党和政府多次重申，将坚持改革开放政策，但是，国际上有人试图把中国排斥在国际社会之外，那是很不明智的，也是短见的。
    李鹏总理接着说，中日关系发展到今天来之不易，我们高兴地看到，许多日本老朋友和著名人士对中国平息暴乱的事件，能以中日友谊大局为重，采取了比较公正的态度，表示继续致力于中日友好，我对此表示赞赏和感谢。
    李鹏总理请宫崎勇回国后向日本各界朋友转告，中国的政局是稳定的，领导核心是团结的，中国将一如既往坚持改革开放，继续致力于中日友好合作关系。
    宫崎勇说，“施密特委员会”赞赏中国的改革开放政策，希望中国积极参加国际经济活动。
