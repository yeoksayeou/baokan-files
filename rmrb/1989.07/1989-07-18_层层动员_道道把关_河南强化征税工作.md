To complete this year's tax collection task, the second half of the year is crucial. Since entering July, Henan Province has seized the opportunity to strengthen tax collection work and take effective measures to ensure the completion of this year's national tax collection task.

In the first half of this year, Henan Province's tax collection increased by 9.1% compared to the same period last year. However, the decrease in the proportion of central and provincial tax revenues makes the completion of the national tax collection task in the second half of the year still face a severe situation: First, many high-profit enterprises have serious tax arrears. By the end of June, the total tax arrears of enterprises in the province reached 410 million yuan; second, the phenomenon of tax evasion on personal income adjustment tax is quite common.

In the past 20 days, the Henan tax authorities have used various propaganda tools to deeply publicize and mobilize at all levels, launching a wave of voluntary tax declaration and payment by taxpayers and strengthened tax collection and inspection by tax authorities across the province. The tax authorities have also classified and ranked enterprises with tax arrears, analyzed the reasons for tax arrears on a case-by-case basis, and for those who deliberately delay tax payments, the tax authorities and banks have jointly put in place checks, adhering to the principle of "tax first, loan later" to collect taxes. Within the tax authorities, a responsibility system is implemented: for major tax sources and key systems, a hierarchical management system is implemented to strengthen on-site collection; for the collection of personal income adjustment tax, judicial, financial, and tax authorities work together to implement comprehensive governance and severely punish tax evaders.

    层层动员  道道把关
    河南强化征税工作
    本报郑州7月18日电　记者李而亮报道：要完成今年的税收任务，后半年是关键。进入7月份以来，河南省不失时机地加强税收工作，采取有效措施以保证今年国家税收任务的完成。
    今年上半年河南省完成税收比去年同期增长9.1％。但是，中央级和省级税收收入比例的下降，使下半年国家税收任务的完成仍面临着严峻的形势：一是不少利税高的企业拖欠税款现象严重。截至6月底，全省企业拖欠税款高达4.1亿元；二是个人收入调节税偷漏税现象相当普遍。
    在最近20天时间里，河南税务部门利用多种宣传工具深入宣传、层层发动，在全省掀起一个纳税人自觉申报缴纳，税务机关加强征收检查的热潮。税务部门还对拖欠税款的企业进行分类排队，逐户分析欠税原因，对有意拖欠税款者，税务部门与银行共同把关，按照先税后贷的原则，催交税款。税务部门内部则实行责任制：对税源大户和重点系统，实行分级管理，加强驻厂征收；对个人收入调节税的征收，由司法、金融、税务机关联合作战，实行综合治理，严厉惩治抗税者。
