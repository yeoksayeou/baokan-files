Before the performance, as the military band played, 20 representatives from the martial law troops marched onto the stage with a dignified military bearing. They received the "Capital Guardians" commemorative medals from the party and state leaders and the Central Military Commission leaders. At this moment, the soldiers in the audience enthusiastically shouted: "Thank you, Motherland! Thank you, people! Thank you, Party!"

Today's celebration performance was themed "The People's Army Loves the People." The theme was prominently displayed on the south side of the stadium. A calligraphy by Deng Xiaoping, "Guardians of the Republic," and three shining military medals were displayed in the center of the south backdrop, stirring the emotions of the entire audience.

At 3:30 PM, the performance began with the soldiers from the army, navy, and air force singing "I Hold the Gun for the People" in a powerful voice. Various art troupes from the Beijing garrison performed today, showcasing the military's 62-year history of unyielding struggle through music, dance, and group singing. "Autumn Harvest Uprising," "Baise Uprising," "Crossing the Red Water Four Times," "Song of the Guerrillas," "Defend the Yellow River," "Rolling Wheels," "The Sky of the Liberated Area," "Song of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army," "Soldier's March," "Learn from Lei Feng, a Good Example," "Goodbye, Mother," and other pieces were selected from various representative works of the military's different historical periods. When the specially composed grand chorus "Red Star Odes - The Republic Will Not Forget" resonated through the hall, the audience erupted in applause. This masterpiece expressed their sentiments.

The songs they performed were familiar to the soldiers, such as "Night in the Military Port," "I Love the Blue Sky of My Motherland," and "The Moon Walks, So Do I." This performance can also be seen as a showcase of the military's high-level creations and performances in recent years.

As the performance came to an end, the party, government, and military leaders on the stage stood up and sang "The March of the Volunteers" with the entire audience. After the performance, the leaders also took a group photo with all the performers. (Photo attached)

    本报北京7月29日讯　记者陈原报道：今天下午，北京空军体育馆洋溢着欢腾的气氛。中国人民解放军总政治部主办的首都戒严部队暨驻京陆海空军、武警部队庆祝“八一”建军节歌舞演出，在这里隆重举行。
    江泽民、杨尚昆、李鹏、万里、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、王震、余秋里、邹家华、陈希同、方毅、王光英、洪学智、刘华清、秦基伟、迟浩田、杨白冰、赵南起等党政军领导同志出席了今天的盛会，他们和全场3500余名官兵及首都各界群众欢聚一堂，共庆人民军队建军62周年。
    演出前，随着军乐声，20名戒严部队官兵代表，军容威武走上主席台，接受党和国家领导、中央军委领导颁发的“首都卫士”纪念章。这时，全场官兵激动地高呼：感谢祖国，感谢人民，感谢党！
    今天的庆祝演出以“人民军队爱人民”为主题，在体育馆南面高悬着这几个寓意深远的大字。由邓小平同志手书的“共和国卫士”题词和三枚闪光耀眼的军功章组成的长方型图案，镶嵌在南面布景的正中，令全场情绪振奋。
    下午3时30分，演出在陆海空军战士齐唱《我为人民扛起枪》的雄壮歌声中开始。驻京部队各文艺团体今天齐临会场，以合奏、合唱、舞蹈以及与全场齐唱等形式，向人们展示了我军62年不屈不挠的战斗历程。《秋收起义》、《百色起义》、《四渡赤水》、《游击队之歌》、《保卫黄河》、《车轮滚滚》、《解放区的天》、《中国人民志愿军战歌》、《士兵进行曲》、《学习雷锋好榜样》、《再见吧，妈妈》等，一部部都是选自我军各个历史时期具有代表性的音乐舞蹈作品。当为这次演出专门创作的大合唱《红星颂——共和国不会忘记》浑然响起时，场内掌声四起。这部力作正唱出了他们的心声。
    李双江、彭丽媛、董文华、郁钧剑、吕金鹤、克里木、阎维文、程志、华超、李清朋、刘军、初瑞、马国光、张暴默、姜志、佟铁鑫、范琳琳、杭天琪等数十名军队著名艺术家，今天也登台独唱。他们或舒缓清雅，或浑厚激昂，配着意境相同的精美舞蹈，从不同角度表现军营的生活，演唱的都是战士熟悉的歌曲，如《军港之夜》、《我爱祖国的蓝天》、《月亮走，我也走》等。这次演出也可以说是近几年军队高水平的创作和表演的展示。
    演出临终，主席台上的党政军领导与全场官兵起立高歌《中国人民解放军军歌》。演出后，领导同志又走下主席台和参加演出的全体演员合影留念。（附图片）
