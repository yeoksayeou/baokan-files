    The tobacco monopoly bureaus and tobacco companies at various levels in Hunan Province, with the support of local party committees and governments, have taken effective measures to rectify and regulate the tobacco market. This year, tobacco procurement has reversed the chaotic situation of the past two years, where multiple entities interfered in the management, raised prices, and engaged in adulteration and fraud. As of July 9, the province has procured over 210,000 piculs of cured tobacco, which basically meet national procurement standards.

    In the past two years, due to the involvement of many departments, units, and tobacco dealers in the management of tobacco leaves, Hunan experienced a "tobacco war," leading to market chaos, price hikes, and widespread adulteration and fraud. The state and cigarette factories suffered losses amounting to 340 million yuan. To reverse the chaotic situation in the tobacco leaf market, the province implemented the "one-stick" policy this year, where tobacco leaves are uniformly managed by the tobacco company, which is responsible for guiding cultivation, procurement, and management. No other departments, units, or individuals are allowed to interfere.

    At the same time, the Hunan Provincial Tobacco Monopoly Bureau and the tobacco company have successively negotiated with neighboring provinces and autonomous regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, and Guizhou, drafting agreements not to compete with each other for tobacco leaves. Problems discovered during procurement are immediately resolved, effectively preventing neighboring provinces, cities, counties, and townships from competing with each other for tobacco leaves.

    禁止多家插手　统一收购经营
    湖南整治烟叶市场
    本报长沙电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省各级烟草专卖局和烟草公司，依靠各级党委、政府支持，采取有效措施，下功夫整顿治理烟草市场，今年烟草收购扭转了前两年烟叶收购多家插手经营、提级提价、掺杂作假的混乱局面，目前，全省烟叶市场秩序良好，到7月9日止，已收购21万多担烤烟，基本符合国家收购标准。
    前两年，由于插手经营烟叶的部门、单位和烟贩多，湖南出现了“烟草大战”，市场混乱，抬级抬价，掺杂作假，国家和卷烟厂损失3.4亿元。为了扭转烟叶市场的混乱局面，该省今年实行了烟叶“一条鞭”，即烟叶统一由烟草公司一家指导培植，负责收购、经营，其它任何部门、单位和个人一律不准插手经营。
    与此同时，湖南省烟草专卖局和烟草公司先后与邻近的广东、广西、贵州等省、自治区的烟草部门进行协商，订出了不相互抢购烟叶的协议。发现收购中的问题，立即解决，基本杜绝了邻近省、地、县、乡相互抢购的现象。
