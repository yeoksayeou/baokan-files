The term "husband" originally did not specifically refer to a woman's spouse. Initially, "husband" was used to refer to adult males; later, it came to refer to all males.

According to the "Guliang Commentary" on the "Annals of the Warring States" (文公二十年), it is recorded: "At the age of twenty, a man wears the cap of adulthood, and upon wearing the cap, he is considered a husband."

In ancient times, the term "husband" was used to refer to all males and also carried the connotation of having a grand demeanor. Therefore, "heroes, heroes of great deeds, and gentlemen of virtue" were also referred to as "husbands." However, when "husband" is prefixed with "great," it refers to a "great man."

As for the term "husband" specifically referring to a woman's spouse, this is because some tribes in China had the custom of abducting brides, where women chose their husbands based mainly on height, with a height of one zhang being the standard. At that time, "eight inches made a chi, and ten chi made a zhang." Ancient measurements were shorter than today's, with one zhang approximately equal to seven modern chi. Having a husband of one zhang in height could help fend off the abduction of strong men. Therefore, women referred to the men they married as "husbands." This specific term has been passed down to this day.

### 琐谈“丈夫”

    琐谈“丈夫”
    丈夫一词，原意并非专指女子的配偶。最初，“丈夫”以称成年男子；后又泛指所有男性。
    据《谷梁传·文公二十年》记载：“男子二十而冠，冠而列丈夫。”
    古时泛称男性为丈夫。还含有气度不凡的意思。因此，对“英雄豪杰、志士仁人”亦称“丈夫”。不过，“丈夫”冠以“大”字，谓“大丈夫”。
    至于“丈夫”为女子的配偶之专称说，是因为我国有些部落，有抢婚陋习，女子选择夫婿，以一定高度为主要条件，一般以身高一丈为标准。当时，“八寸为尺，十尺为丈”。古时尺寸较今量短，大约一丈合今七市尺。有了身高一丈的夫婿，才可以抵御强人的抢婚。因此，女子称其所嫁男子为“丈夫”。这一专称相沿至今。
