Xinhua News Agency, Harare, July 18th. Reporter Li Jingwei reports: The leadership of Zimbabwe's ZANU held a meeting recently and decided that party members who are accused by the parliament of committing crimes must resign from their parliamentary and party positions. It was President Mugabe who announced this at a press conference yesterday.

President Mugabe said that ZANU advocates that party members who commit crimes should resign from their party positions, retaining only their party membership, and must also resign from their parliamentary positions.

He said that there might be one or two people who do not want to resign from their current positions, but those who violate the regulations will have to resign.

Not long ago, several government ministers were dismissed from their posts for involvement in a car smuggling case.

    津巴布韦执政党民盟决定
    党员犯罪必须辞职
    本报哈拉雷7月18日电  记者李景卫报道：津巴布韦民盟领导人在最近召开的一次会议上决定，被议会指控犯有罪行的党员必须辞去在议会中担任的职务和党内职务。穆加贝总统是昨天在记者招待会上说这一番话的。
    穆加贝总统说，民盟主张那些犯有罪行的党员辞去党内职务，只保留党员身份，并且必须同时辞去在议会中的职务。
    他说，可能有一两个人不想辞去现任职务，但是，凡违反规定的人不得不辞去职务。
    前不久，政府几名部长因牵涉倒卖汽车案已被解除职务。
