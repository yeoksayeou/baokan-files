	Yao Yilin, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council, said today at the national financial work conference that rectification and readjustment involve all aspects, but financial balance holds a particularly important position because it is a crucial foundation for the overall balance of the national economy. Once the deficit is eliminated and financial balance is achieved, the task of rectification and readjustment will be basically completed. He urged all levels of financial departments to do everything possible to fulfill the national budget approved by the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress.

	Yao Yilin said that the "double increase and double saving" campaign must be further carried out. Production should be increased through saving energy and raw materials, and in the process of increasing production, industrial policies should be implemented to achieve increased production and increased revenue. Financial departments should, in accordance with existing policies and laws, collect all revenues that should be collected. They should vigorously advocate for hard work and entrepreneurship, truly establish the idea of living frugally for a few years, and reduce all possible expenditures. He said that in terms of controlling social purchasing power, whether it is for controlled or non-controlled commodities, if it is not necessary to buy, it should be firmly not bought; if it is not necessary to hold meetings, it should be firmly not held; sending gifts should be firmly stopped, whether it is for party and government agencies or enterprises, whether it is in cities or rural areas, sending gifts is not allowed. Efforts must be made to rectify companies, punish corruption, and achieve results.

	Yao Yilin also criticized some units for disregarding the overall situation during the turmoil and secretly starting basic construction projects, even building office buildings. He emphasized that in the process of rectification and readjustment, it is necessary to strengthen the overall concept.

	The national financial work conference concluded today in Beijing.

    姚依林在全国财政工作会上强调
    全力完成今年国家预算
    进一步开展“双增双节”运动
    本报北京7月13日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：中共中央政治局常委、国务院副总理姚依林今天在全国财政工作会议上指出，治理整顿涉及到各个方面，但财政平衡占有十分重要的位置，因为它是国民经济综合平衡的重要基础。赤字消除了，财政平衡了，治理整顿的任务才算基本完成。他要求各级财政部门，千方百计完成七届人大二次会议通过的今年国家预算。
    姚依林说，必须进一步开展“双增双节”运动。要从节约能源、原材料中求增产，在增产中还要注意贯彻执行产业政策，做到增产增收。财政部门要按照现行的政策法令，把一切应收的收入都收上来。要大力提倡艰苦创业，真正树立起过几年紧日子的思想，把一切可节减的支出节减下来。他说，在压缩社会集团购买力方面，要做到不管控购商品还是非控购商品，能不买的坚决不买；能不开的会坚决不开；请客送礼要坚决制止，不管是党政机关还是企业，不管是城市还是农村，都不允许搞请客送礼。要坚决整顿公司，惩治腐败，做出成效。
    姚依林还批评一些单位在动乱期间不顾大局，偷偷地上基本建设项目，甚至搞楼堂馆所。他强调在治理整顿中必须加强全局观念。
    全国财政工作会议今日在京结束。
