	Editor,

	Since the beginning of summer, there have been three serious fires in the Zhenzhi District of Nanjiang County, Sichuan. The affected households are all large courtyard residences with more than three families. Although the causes of the fires are clear and the property losses have been compensated according to the insurance regulations, when one family's fire spreads to another, who is responsible for the resulting property damage? Please provide an explanation.

	Mr. Yuxing Wu,

	We have not verified the situation you mentioned. However, we will respond to the issues raised in your letter as follows:

	To determine whether the person whose house caught fire should bear the responsibility for the property damage suffered by others, we must first establish whether the fire caused by one family constitutes a tort. Generally, for a tort to be established, four elements must be present: ① the existence of harm; ② a causal relationship between the tortious act and the harm; ③ the actor's subjective fault in committing the act and causing the harm; and ④ the unlawfulness of the act. Only when all four elements are present can the actor be held liable for the tort. It is clear that a fire starting in one's own home and causing damage to another's property meets all four elements. Therefore, the person whose house caught fire is the one liable for the tort. Article 106 of the "General Principles of the Civil Law of the People's Republic of China" states: "Citizens and legal persons who, due to fault, infringe upon the property of the state, collective property, or the property or person of another shall bear civil liability." The term "fault" here refers to the actor's mental state regarding the act and the resulting harm, which includes both intent and negligence. In other words, to determine whether the actor should bear civil liability for the tort, we usually look at whether the actor is at fault. If a person intentionally sets a fire or negligently causes a fire that spreads to another's property, causing damage, the actor's behavior is clearly at fault, and thus the actor should bear civil compensation liability. If the actor's behavior causes serious harm that constitutes a criminal offense, criminal liability should also be pursued according to law. Of course, if the actor is not at fault and the fire is caused by an unforeseen event, such as a lightning strike, then both the person whose house caught fire and the person whose property was damaged are victims of a natural disaster, and each should bear their own losses.

	For fires that have already been compensated by the insurance company according to the insurance regulations, the property damage within the scope of the insurance coverage for the affected households cannot be claimed from the person whose house caught fire. Instead, the insurance company should seek compensation from the person whose house caught fire if there is fault. For property damage outside the scope of the insurance coverage, the affected households can seek compensation from the person whose house caught fire if there is fault.

### 一家失火殃及他家损失由谁承担？

    一家失火殃及他家损失由谁承担？
    编辑同志：
    入夏以来，四川南江县正直区连续发生3起严重火灾，受灾的农户都是3户以上同居的大院子。虽然失火的起因明确，房屋损失均按保险条例作了赔偿，但因一家失火，殃及了他家的财产遭受损失，由谁负责？请解答。　四川南江县　余兴吾
    余兴吾同志：
    你反映的情况我们没有核实，现就来信提及的情节答复如下：
    要确认因一家失火而殃及他家财产遭受损失，失火人家是否应承担受殃及人家财产损失的赔偿责任，首先就要确认失火人家的行为是否构成侵权损害。在一般情况下，侵权损害的民事责任，须具备4个要件才能构成，即：①损害事实的存在；②侵权行为与损害事实有因果关系；③行为人在主观上对自己的行为及其损害结果确有过错；④行为的违法性。只有同时具备了上述4个要件的行为人，才能成为侵权损害的民事责任者。不难看出，自家失火而造成他家财产损失的，完全符合上述4要件，因而失火者也就是侵权损害的民事责任者。《中华人民共和国民法通则》第106条规定：“公民、法人由于过错侵害国家的、集体的财产，侵害他人财产、人身的，应当承担民事责任。”这里讲的过错，是指行为人对其实施某种行为和损害结果的发生所持的一种心理状态，它包括故意和过失两种。也就是说，在行为人的行为已经造成他人损害的事实前提下，要确认行为人是否承担侵权赔偿的民事责任，通常主要看行为人是否有过错。自家故意纵火或者过失失火，殃及他家，使他家财产遭受损失的，行为人的行为显然有过错，因此行为人就应当承担民事赔偿责任。如其行为造成重大损失触及刑律的，还要依法追究其刑事责任。当然，行为人不存在任何过错，火灾是因意想不到的原因引起的，如雷击起火等不可抗拒的原因。那么，起火的和殃及的人家都是天灾受害者，损失由各自承担。
    对于火灾后已由保险公司按照保险条例作了赔偿的，火灾殃及的其他人家的保险财产范围内的损失，就不能再向失火人家要求赔偿了，而只能由保险公司向有过错的失火人家代为索赔。保险财产范围以外的财产损失，被殃及的人家可向有过错的失火人家索赔。
