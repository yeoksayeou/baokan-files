The Greek interim government, composed of the conservative New Democracy Party and the radical Left and Progressive Alliance, was sworn in at the presidential palace on July 2, ending the political stalemate that followed the June 18 elections.

The interim government consists of 23 members, with New Democracy MP and former Public Works Minister Tzanis Tzanetakis serving as the Prime Minister.

The 62-year-old Tzanetakis was officially tasked by President Papoulias to form the government late on July 1. Prior to this, the leaders of Greece's three major parties—the New Democracy Party, PASOK, and the Left Alliance—had all attempted and failed to form a government. The main reason was that the June 18 elections did not produce a majority party, and the leaders of the three major parties had differing opinions and were unwilling to compromise, resulting in an inability to find a cooperative partner.

Tzanetakis was proposed by New Democracy leader Mitsotakis as the candidate for interim prime minister in the face of the stalemate. This proposal received the support of the Left Alliance. Subsequently, Tzanetakis and the leaders of the Left Alliance jointly decided on the term, purpose, tasks, and composition of the coalition government.

On July 2, Tzanetakis appointed two members of the Left Alliance to key positions in his interim government—Minister of Justice and Minister of the Interior. The young lawyer Nikos Konstantopoulos was appointed Minister of the Interior, and Fotis Kouvelis, president of the Athens Bar Association, was appointed Minister of Justice. Both are prominent figures within the Left Alliance.

The Left Alliance is primarily composed of the Greek Communist Party and the Left Party. The participation of its members in the government is a first in the past 40 years in Greece. Mitsotakis stated at the swearing-in ceremony of the interim government that the cooperation of two parties that have long been at odds signifies that the long-awaited national reconciliation and unity of the Greek people has been achieved, which will undoubtedly benefit the country's democracy and progress.

In addition to serving as Prime Minister, Tzanetakis also holds the position of Minister of Foreign Affairs in the interim government. The other ministers are composed of relatively moderate former ministers and prominent figures from the New Democracy Party.

July 2, the new Greek cabinet, composed of 22 members, held its first meeting. According to reports, the conservative New Democracy Party and the Left and Progressive Alliance reached a compromise on July 1, deciding to form a coalition government, thereby ending the two-week-long cabinet crisis in Greece.

    希腊临时政府宣誓就职
    新民主党议员察奈塔基斯任总理
    据新华社雅典7月2日电（记者周锡生）由保守的新民主党和激进的左派及进步力量联盟组成的希腊临时政府2日中午在总统府宣誓就职，从而结束了希腊上月18日大选以来所出现的政治僵局。
    临时政府由23人组成，新民主党议员、前公共工程部长察尼斯·察奈塔基斯任总理。
    62岁的察奈塔基斯是1日晚正式受萨采塔基斯总统之命组阁的。在此之前，希腊三大党——新民主党、泛希社运和左派联盟——的领袖先后组阁均告失败，主要原因是6月18日的大选未能产生多数党，三大党领袖均想组阁而意见相左，互不妥协，结果都未能找到合作伙伴。
    察奈塔基斯是由新民主党领袖米佐塔基斯在僵持不下的情况下提议为临时政府总理候选人的。这一人选得到了左派联盟的支持。之后，察奈塔基斯同左派联盟领导人共同商定了联合政府的期限、目的、任务和组成等重大问题。
    察奈塔基斯2日任命了两名左派联盟的成员担任其临时政府的两个重要职务——司法部长和内政部长。担任内政部长的是年轻的律师尼科斯·康斯坦托普洛斯，执掌司法部的是雅典律师协会会长福提斯·库维利斯。他们俩都是左派联盟中的知名人士。
    左派联盟主要由希腊共产党和左翼党组成，其成员正式参政在希腊最近40年来属首次。米佐塔基斯在临时政府宣誓就职仪式上发表讲话说，两个长期以来不和的政党成员联合执政表明，希腊人民渴望已久的民族和解和民族团结已经实现，它无疑将有利于国家的民主和进步。
    察奈塔基斯除担任总理职务外，还兼任临时政府的外交部长。该政府的其他部长由新民主党中被认为较温和的前部长和知名人士担任。（附图片）
    七月二日，由二十二名成员组成的希腊新内阁举行首次会议。据报道，希腊保守的新民主党和左派及进步力量联盟于一日达成一项妥协，决定组成一个联合政府，从而结束了希腊已持续了两周的组阁危机。
