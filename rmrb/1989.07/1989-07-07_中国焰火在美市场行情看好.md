    Chinese fireworks are enjoying a favorable market trend in the United States. On July 4, the United States celebrated its Independence Day. In Washington, D.C., in addition to parades and outdoor concerts, fireworks were set off.

    In recent years, setting off fireworks has become a major activity for Americans celebrating Independence Day. Over the past 10 years, the sales volume of fireworks in the United States has surged, increasing from 29 million pounds in 1976 to 75 million pounds in 1988. According to the Washington Post, 80% of these fireworks are imported from China. Many fireworks dealers have praised, "Chinese fireworks are both beautiful and affordable. No other country's fireworks technology can compare with China's." To ensure a steady supply of fireworks, some fireworks importers have already sent representatives to China to negotiate business deals.

    中国焰火在美市场行情看好
    本报讯　7月4日是美国的独立节。在华盛顿，除了举行游行和露天音乐会等庆祝活动外，燃放了焰火。
    近年来，燃放焰火已成为美国人庆祝独立节的一项主要内容。在过去10年中，美国的焰火销售量直线上升，由1976年的2900万磅猛增到1988年的7500万磅。据《华盛顿邮报》报道，其中80％是从中国进口的，许多经营焰火的商人称赞说，“中国的焰火物美价廉，没有任何一个国家制作焰火的技术可以同中国相比美”。为了确保焰火供应，一些焰火进口商已派代表前往中国洽谈生意。　（姜桂英）
