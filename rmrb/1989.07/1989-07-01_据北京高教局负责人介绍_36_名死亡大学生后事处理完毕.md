Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 1st.

A relevant official from the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau told reporters today that among the 36 university students who died during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, none were killed at Tiananmen Square.

The official said that the 36 students came from 20 different universities. Among them, 6 students from Renmin University of China, 3 from Tsinghua University, 3 from Beijing University of Technology, 2 each from Beijing University, Beijing Normal University, and 7 other universities, and 1 each from the remaining 10 universities.

Beijing currently has 83 colleges and universities with over 156,000 students.

The official said that many of these students died during the riot because they did not heed the emergency notices from the martial law command and the Beijing Municipal Government, ignored repeated warnings from school leaders, teachers, and parents, and rushed to areas like Muxidi, Xidan, Nanchizi, and Zhushikou where the riots were happening. Some of them participated in the riot activities, and items such as "High Autonomy Federation" death squad member certificates, "patrol team" member certificates, and "High Autonomy Federation" leaders' personally signed "passes" were found in their pockets. Some were injured and died while blocking military vehicles, and a few were accidentally injured and died while passing by the scene.

After the incident, relevant departments and universities in Beijing established special task forces to handle the affairs of the deceased students. After repeated verification and consultations with the families of the deceased students, the affairs were settled. During the process, detailed records were kept of each student's cause of death, location of death, rescue process, and handling results. Now, all 36 deceased students have been cremated, and their families have participated in the handling of their affairs.

Additionally, according to information provided by the Beijing Funeral Services, 15 outsiders died in Beijing during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot.

    据北京高教局负责人介绍
    36名死亡大学生后事处理完毕
    新华社北京7月1日电  北京市高教局有关负责人今天对记者说，在北京平息反革命暴乱过程中死亡的36名大学生中，没有一名是在天安门广场出事的。
    这位负责人说，36名大学生分属20所高等院校，其中中国人民大学死亡6名，清华大学和北京科技大学各死亡3名，北京大学、北京师范大学等7所院校各死亡2名，其余10所院校各死亡1名。
    北京现在共有83所大专院校，15.6万多名在校学生。
    这位负责人说，这些死亡的大学生中，许多人是在暴乱期间不听从戒严部队指挥部和北京市人民政府的紧急通告，不顾学校各级领导、教师和父母再三阻止，赶赴木樨地、西单、南池子、珠市口等暴乱发生地点而出事的。他们中，有的参加了暴乱活动，从这些人的衣服口袋中发现有非法组织“高自联”敢死队队员证、“纠察队”队员证和“高自联”头头亲笔签发的“出入证”；有的是在围观阻拦军车时被打伤致死的；也有个别学生是路过现场时被误伤致死的。
    北京市有关部门、有关高校事件发生后成立了专门的工作小组，负责处理这些死亡学生的后事。经反复查对，并与死亡学生家长多次协商，进行了处理。处理过程中详细登记了每一名大学生的死亡情况、死亡地点、救护过程及处理结果。现在36名死亡大学生都已火化，学生家长都参加了后事处理。
    另据北京市殡葬处提供的消息，在这次平息反革命暴乱过程中，在京死亡的外地人共有15名。
