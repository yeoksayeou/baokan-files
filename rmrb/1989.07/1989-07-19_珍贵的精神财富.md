Just after the New Year, news came of the passing of Comrade Yu Jie, who had served as Vice Minister of the Grain Department and the Commerce Department, and as a Standing Committee member of the Fifth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This news filled us with profound sorrow.

Comrade Yu Jie participated in the revolution for over 60 years, consistently loyal to the revolution and the people, achieving indelible accomplishments in every historical period.

In the early 1930s, he successively served as the supply officer for the Red Army's regiment and brigade, facing the enemy's repeated "encirclements" and extremely harsh conditions. He excelled in the task of procuring supplies and funds for the troops, ensuring the victory of the counter-encirclement campaigns, and truly deserved the title of an outstanding logistics officer.

After the "July 7th Incident," the Red Army was reorganized into the National Revolutionary Army. Comrade Yu Jie, after the Long March, served as the supply department head of the 385th Brigade of the 129th Division. In August 1938, he was transferred to the deputy director of the military cooperation society of the Military Commission's supply department. From December 1939 to November 1942, he served as the secretary of the Eighth Route Army's Xi'an office, promoting the party's anti-Japanese stance in a new environment, developing united front work in various forms; sending progressive youth to Yan'an, strengthening revolutionary forces; procuring, purchasing, and transporting war supplies, making new contributions to the war effort.

After the "New Fourth Army Incident," the Kuomintang completely stopped issuing salaries to the Eighth Route Army, while intensifying the economic blockade of the border areas, making it difficult for the border areas to export local products and even harder to import supplies from enemy areas. They aimed to strangle the anti-Japanese democratic base areas through economic pressure and blockade. To counter this, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Trade Bureau (later renamed the Northwest Trade Company) was established, and the funds and inventory of various agencies were pooled to form the Northwest Native Products Company and the Northwest Salt Industry Company, both under the leadership of the Trade Bureau. In January 1944, Comrade He Long, the director of the Northwest Financial Office, decided to transfer Comrade Yu Jie, who was serving as the secretary of the office, to the Northwest Native Products Company as the manager. From then on, he transitioned from military supply work to local work. After taking office at the Native Products Company, he, with the authority to manage business operations, select and transfer personnel, and reward and punish personnel, took a series of effective measures: first, he improved the system, effectively overcoming the phenomenon of various agencies and units simply issuing vouchers, recording accounts, and taking supplies without payment, as well as the low management level and frequent losses; second, he flexibly managed prices, adopting high, medium, and low prices for external trade prices based on the import situation, and an average medium price policy for domestic market prices, achieving the social benefit of breaking the blockade and stabilizing the market, and increasing enterprise profits. Not only did it make up for past losses and returned the invested capital of various units, but it also accumulated a reserve of 100,000 taels of gold; third, he seized the opportunity to procure materials and gold. After Japan's surrender, the Native Products and Salt Industry Companies were merged into the Northwest Trade Company, and Comrade Yu Jie successively served as deputy manager and manager. At that time, the Central Bank of the Kuomintang sold gold, and the corrupt officials of the Kuomintang government, especially the "Four Big Families," took the opportunity to seize gold. Our Trade Company immediately transferred the stored legal tender to the border, buying goods brought in by merchants and gold in the market at the rising legal tender price and falling gold price. In just two months, it purchased over 20,000 bolts of cloth, over 100,000 catties of cotton, and over 100,000 taels of gold (totaling over 200,000 taels), thus not only shielding the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area market from the impact of the exchange rate fluctuations between legal tender and border currency but also ensuring the further stability of the border area's finance and prices. In August 1945, during Comrade Yu Jie's leadership of the Northwest Native Products Company, he also participated in the re-negotiations between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang in Chongqing as a representative of the party's industrial and commercial circles, alongside Comrades Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, and achieved success.

From March 1947, during the year when the enemy occupied Yan'an, he led the Northwest Trade Company's entire staff to move around in northern Shaanxi, evacuating supplies and protecting revolutionary property from loss while continuing operations to ensure the essential living needs of soldiers and civilians during the war. After the liberation of Xi'an in May 1949, he led the Northwest Trade Company and the Northwest Farmers' Bank (he had previously served as the bank's president) to move south to Xi'an to develop commercial work in the newly liberated areas. That winter, he was appointed as the Minister of the Northwest Military and Political Commission's Trade Department, establishing the state-owned commercial system in various provinces in Northwest China, contributing to the development of socialist commodity circulation, promoting production, and meeting the people's living needs. In the winter of 1952, the Northwest Military and Political Commission was renamed the Northwest Administrative Commission, and he was transferred to the position of Deputy Director of the Northwest Administrative Commission's Financial and Economic Commission. Starting from 1953, China entered a new period of large-scale socialist construction. With the dismantling of the regional structures, he was transferred to Beijing in 1954, successively serving as Vice Minister of the Grain Department of the People's Republic of China, Vice Minister of the Commerce Department, and Director of the Supervision Commission's Supervision Group at the Ministry of Finance. Shortly before he started working at the Grain Department, due to the shortage of grain procurement and the sharp supply-demand contradiction, the central government decided to change the free trade of grain to a unified procurement and marketing policy. This means that he, having just transferred from the region to the central government, was immediately involved in the second major battle in the economic field following the first major battle of national financial and economic unification in the early years of the founding of the country. The responsibility was immense. After transferring to the Commerce Department, in addition to actively participating in the leadership of national commercial work, he paid special attention to the ethnic trade work he was in charge of. In November 1962, the fifth national ethnic trade conference was held, the first in 6.5 years since the founding of the country. In his summary report at the conference, he emphasized the need to restore production and supply special commodities for ethnic minorities. After the conference, the state approved the increase in the scope and scale of care for ethnic trade, and for the first time clearly defined the price subsidies, self-owned funds, and profit retention for ethnic trade as the "three care policies."

In summary, after 20 years of supply work in harsh wartime conditions, he entered another 20 years of socialist economic construction, accumulating new experiences and achieving new successes in the breadth and depth of commercial work.

1970 was a new turning point in his life. He voluntarily proposed to step down from his leadership position, with the approval of Premier Zhou, he left the big cities and returned to his hometown in Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, where he lived until his passing. During the nearly 20 years after his return, especially since the 1980s, not only local newspapers in Hunan but also major national newspapers have reported on his moving deeds in the countryside in vivid and dynamic ways: "Public Servant - Commemorating Yu Jie, a Standing Committee member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" (Issue 23, 1980, Red Flag Magazine); "Retiring but Not Retiring from the Revolution - Commemorating the retired cadre Yu Jie who returned to his hometown" (March 9, 1982, China Finance and Trade News); "Yu Jie Returns to the Countryside" (April 24, 1982, Young People); "After 12 Years of Returning to the Countryside, Dedicated to Rural Construction, the Masses Praise the Revolutionary Spirit of Old Red Army Yu Jie" (May 28, 1982, People's Daily); "Farming is My Job" - Commemorating the retired vice minister and old Red Army cadre Yu Jie's education of three generations of descendants to love farming" (June 27, 1982, China Farmer's Daily); "Capturing the Tall Figure of This Communist Party Member - Commemorating the Old Red Army Cadre Yu Jie" (July 3, 1982, China Youth Daily); "A Lamp in Lijiang" (August 28, 1985, People's Daily); "Yu Jie, after 15 years of retirement, devoted himself to building water and electricity for his hometown, Li Xiannian wrote a letter praising him as a model for old cadres" (December 22, 1985, People's Daily); "The Minister's Choice" (March 29, 1988, China Commerce News); "From Minister to Farmer - Commemorating the retired cadre Yu Jie of the Ministry of Finance" (September 30, 1988, Economic Daily); "The Character of an Old Revolutionary Comrade - Yu Jie's 'Five Children'" (November 26, 1988, People's Daily); and so on. Reading the detailed reports and objective evaluations of Yu Jie's various advanced deeds after his return to his hometown, it stirred people's admiration and respect for this retired but not retired from the revolution old cadre, selfless Communist Party member, and public servant with noble character. The fact that he received nearly 20,000 visitors and 20,000 letters during his nearly 20 years of return to his hometown most vividly shows the great influence of Comrade Yu Jie's tall figure on farmers, workers, cadres, and even central leaders, as well as on the elderly and youth over the years.

We have worked under Comrade Yu Jie's leadership since Yan'an, and his words and deeds have had a great influence on us. His noble character that is most unforgettable to us mainly includes:

First, he insisted on principles and dared to take the initiative. He was always pragmatic, never exaggerating his achievements and never hiding his shortcomings. In any situation and any work, he never put on a show, always taking solid steps. His thoughts were pure but not conservative; instead, he dared to take the initiative, even in the most difficult environments, he could propose bold ideas to open up new situations for work. In the 1940s, when he served in the Northwest Native Products Company, he proposed the requirement of giving himself three autonomous powers, and the great achievements he made are the best proof of this.

Second, he was upright and incorruptible. In personnel relations, he respected his superiors but judged by the merits of the case, not by the person. He was upright and outspoken, always putting people's relationships in the position of comrade relationships and work relationships, never mixing personal relationships and human relationships into work relationships. Those bad practices of pulling strings, flattering, and currying favor were completely alien to him. On the contrary, he was firm in opposing false reporting, exaggeration, and deceit that harmed the party and the people's cause, and even dared to take risks to report upwards. It is particularly worth mentioning that in 1958 and 1959, when he served as Vice Minister of the Grain Department, after field investigations, he truthfully reported to the central government the false reporting that appeared during the "Great Leap Forward" and put forward some different views on the grain situation. This was normal, and as the vice minister in charge of grain work, it was within his scope of responsibility. However, during the "anti-rightist" rectification movement, he was criticized for this, even demoted, and was rehabilitated two years later. In the report to the central government by the Grain Department, it was clearly stated: "Comrade Yu Jie's views and different opinions on the situation and grain situation in 1958 and 1959 at the party's meeting are now seen as reflecting some actual situations in the implementation of policies and work, all of which are correct." However, during the "Cultural Revolution," he was again slandered and persecuted by Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four." Although he carried a heavy ideological burden for a long time, it did not affect his actions of wholeheartedly doing good for the people of his hometown and serving the revolutionary cause. This is indeed rare.

Third, he was strict with himself and selfless. His life was always very frugal, and this remained unchanged even after he retired and returned to his hometown. Every time we visited his hometown, his home was only furnished with a few old, unpainted pieces of furniture and a transistor radio, with nothing else. He refused all the generous treatment he was entitled to, including high-level housing and a car, and insisted on educating his descendants to be thrifty and love the countryside, while he spared no effort to help others solve difficulties and build his hometown. There are countless moving examples of this: the hometown lacked doctors, and he sent village doctors for further training; villagers lacked medicine, and he bought medicine for them; an elderly widow was always taken care of by him; a martyr's daughter got married, and he represented the deceased old comrade to send a gift; a woman had difficulty giving birth, and he provided assistance; a farmer's house caught fire, and he sent money to help; to promote the construction of the highway, he provided a reward for the road workers; visitors from afar who came to him to reflect problems or seek justice lacked travel expenses, and he enthusiastically helped them. To build his hometown, he not only actively and proactively provided advice but also donated money to buy cows, pigs, urgently needed agricultural materials, repair the storage room, build roads, build bridges, plant trees, and establish factories. Especially to build electricity for his hometown, he generously donated 14,900 yuan and walked with a cane in the green mountains and rivers, from surveying and designing to construction, he devoted his energy until six small hydropower stations were built and generating electricity.

Comrade Yu Jie's legacy was only a few flat houses and a savings book with 800 yuan, but he left his hometown with smooth rural roads, dense fields and forests, and several factories. Most importantly, he left precious spiritual wealth for the people of the whole country. The people will forever remember him.

    珍贵的精神财富
    薛宏福　马尔赤　杨德颖
    新春刚过，传来曾任粮食部、商业部副部长，五届全国政协常委喻杰同志病故的噩耗，使我们抑制不住心情的悲痛。
    喻杰同志参加革命60余年，一贯忠于革命、忠于人民，在各个历史阶段取得了不可磨灭的成就。
    30年代初，他先后担任红军的师团供给工作，面临敌人的屡次“围剿”和十分艰苦的环境，出色地完成了为部队筹粮筹款的任务，保证了反“围剿”的胜利，不愧是一位卓越的后勤干部。
    “七七”事变后，红军改编为国民革命军，喻杰同志经过长征担任一二九师三八五旅供给部长。1938年8月，调任军委供给部军人合作社副主任。1939年12月至1942年11月，调任八路军西安办事处秘书主任，在新的环境下以不同形式为宣传党的抗日主张，开展统一战线工作；输送进步青年去延安，壮大革命力量；领取、采购、转运战争物资，支援抗战做出了新贡献。
    “皖南事变”后，国民党完全停发八路军的军饷，同时加紧对边区实行经济封锁，使得边区的土产不易输出，敌区的物资更难输入，他们想用经济上的压力和封锁来窒息抗日民主根据地。为了反封锁的需要，成立了陕甘宁边区贸易局（后改为西北贸易公司），并吸收各机关的资金和存货，成立了西北土产公司以及由机关合资的西北盐业公司，归贸易局领导。1944年1月，西北财经办事处兼主任贺龙同志确定把该处担任秘书主任的喻杰同志调到西北土产公司任经理，从此他由军队供给工作转入地方。他在土产公司上任后，凭借业务自主权、人员选拔权和人员调动奖惩权，放手地采取了一系列有力措施：一是完善制度，有效地克服了当时存在的各机关单位只凭批条、记笔帐、不付款就拿走物资的单纯供给现象以及管理水平不高、经常亏损的局面；二是灵活掌握价格，即对外贸易价格，根据输入情况分别采取高、中、低价，平均达到中等价，内地市场价格，采取稳在中价的政策，收到了打破封锁、稳定市场的社会效益，并使企业利润增长，不仅补上了以往的亏损，退还了各单位投入的股金，还积累了10万两黄金的家底；三是抓住时机筹集物资、黄金，日本投降后，土产、盐业两公司并入西北贸易公司，喻杰同志先后任副经理、经理，当时，国民党中央银行抛售黄金，国民党政府的贪官污吏们特别是“四大家族”乘机抓黄金，我贸易公司随即把库存法币运到边境，按涨价的法币价和跌价的黄金价，收购商人带进的货物和市场上的黄金，在两个月内即收购细布2万多匹、棉花10万多斤以及黄金10万多两（连前共20多万两），这样不仅使陕甘宁边区市场免受了法币与边币比价变动的影响，而且保证了边区金融、物价的更加稳定。1945年8月，喻杰同志领导西北土产公司期间，还作为我党工商界代表，跟随毛泽东、周恩来同志参加国共重庆谈判，取得成功。
    1947年3月起，敌陷延安的一年时期内，他率西北贸易公司全体人员辗转于陕北，一边疏散物资，保护了革命财产免受损失，一边坚持营业，保证了战时军民必不可少的生活需要。1949年5月西安解放后，他又率西北贸易公司和西北农民银行（此前他兼任行长）全体人员南下西安开辟新解放区商业工作。同年冬，他任西北军政委员会贸易部部长，在西北各省创建了国营商业系统，为发展社会主义商品流通，促进生产，满足人民生活需要做出了贡献。1952年冬，西北军政委员会改为西北行政委员会，他被调任西北行政委员会财经委员会副主任。从1953年起，我国进入大规模的社会主义新时期，随着大区机构的撤销，他于1954年调到北京，先后任中华人民共和国粮食部副部长、商业部副部长、中监委驻财政部监察组组长。他在粮食部工作前不久，由于粮食购少销多、供求矛盾尖锐，中央确定将粮食的自由贸易改为实行统购统销政策，这就是说，他从大区刚到中央，就投身于建国初期在经济领域里继财政经济大统一的第一次大战役之后的第二次大战役，其责任的重大可想而知。在调到商业部工作后，除积极参与领导全国商业工作外，对主管的民族贸易工作尤为关注，1962年11月召开了建国以来时隔6年半之久的第五次全国民族贸易会议，他在会议总结报告中强调指出，要恢复生产和供应少数民族特需商品。会后，国家批准增加对民族贸易的照顾项目和照顾幅度，并首次明确将对民族贸易的价格补贴、自有资金和利润留成照顾，统一称为“三项照顾”政策。
    总之，他在艰苦的战争环境从事20年供给工作之后，转入社会主义经济建设的又一个20年，在开展商业工作等方面无论是广度还是深度都不断积累了新经验，取得了新成就。
    1970年是他一生中新的转折点，他主动提出退出领导岗位，经周总理批准，他离开了大城市，返回湖南省平江县山村故乡落户，直到病故。在他返乡后的近20年期间特别是80年代以来，不仅湖南等省地方报刊而且全国主要报刊对他在农村的感人事迹纷纷作了生动的报道：《公仆——记全国政协常委喻杰》（1980年《红旗》杂志第23期）；《离职不离革命——记离休回乡的老干部喻杰》（1982年3月9日《中国财贸报》）；《老干部喻杰归田记》（1982年4月24日《年轻人》）；《回乡休养12年献身农村建设，群众赞扬老红军喻杰革命精神》（1982年5月28日《人民日报》）；《“种田就是工作”——记离休副部长、红军老干部喻杰教育三代儿孙热爱务农的事迹》（1982年6月27日《中国农民报》）；《摄下这位共产党员的高大形象——记红军老干部喻杰同志》（1982年7月3日《中国青年报》）；《丽江一盏灯》（1985年8月28日《人民日报》）；《喻杰离休15年为家乡办水电尽心竭力，李先念写信赞誉他为老同志作出了表率》（1985年12月22日《人民日报》）；《部长的选择》（1988年3月29日《中国商业报》）；《从部长到农民——记财政部离休老干部喻杰》（1988年9月30日《经济日报》）；《一个革命老同志的情操——喻杰过“五子”关》（1988年11月26日《人民日报》）；等等。看了上述对喻杰同志返乡后种种先进事迹所作的翔实报道和客观评价，激起人们对这位离职不离革命的老干部、无私奉献的共产党员、情操高尚的人民公仆的无限爱戴和崇高敬仰。从他返乡的近20年中接待来访2万多人次、收到来信2万多件这些事实中，最有说服力地表明喻杰同志的高大形象对农民、工人、干部以至中央领导同志，老人、青年以至少年的巨大感染力。
    我们从延安起，就长期在喻杰同志的领导下工作，他的言传身教对我们的影响极大，他的高尚品德最使人难以忘怀的主要有：
    一是坚持原则，勇于进取。他一贯实事求是，对成绩绝不夸张，缺点毫不掩饰，在任何情况下、干任何工作从来不摆花架子，总是一步一个实脚踪。他思想纯正但并不保守，相反勇于进取，即使在最困难的环境下也能提出打开工作新局面的大胆设想，在西北土产公司任职的40年代，他就提出给自己三个自主权的要求，因此而取得了重大成果就是最好的证明。
    二是一身正气，两袖清风。在人事关系方面，他尊重上级，但认事不认人，他刚直不阿，在工作中总是把人与人的关系摆在同志关系、工作关系的位子，从来也不把私人关系、人情关系夹杂到工作关系中来，那种办事拉拉扯扯、阿谀奉承的歪风邪气，对他来说是风马牛不相及的。相反，对于虚报浮夸、骗取荣誉等等损害党和人民事业的倾向，则宁肯自己承担风险也要秉直向上反映。特别值得提到的是，他在担任粮食部副部长的1958年、1959年，经过外出调查，向中央如实地反映了“大跃进”中出现的浮夸风，并对粮食局势提出了自己的一些不同看法，这本是正常的，作为主管粮食工作的副部长更是责任范围之内的事情，但在“反右倾”整风运动中却因此而受到批判，直至贬职，2年后得到平反，在粮食部向中央的报告中明确提到：“喻杰同志当时在党的会议上，对1958年和1959年的形势和粮食局势提出的一些看法和不同意见，现在看来，是反映了执行政策和工作中的一些实际情况，都是对的。”然而在“文化大革命”中，又遭林彪、“四人帮”的诬陷和打击，在漫长的时期内，他虽背着沉重的思想包袱却丝毫也没有影响一心一意为家乡人民办好事、为革命事业当警察的行动，表现了一个共产党人的高尚气节，这实在是难能可贵的。
    三是严以律己，无私奉献。他的生活一贯十分俭朴，直到他离职返乡后始终如一，我们每次到他家乡看望时，他家中都只是摆放几件没有上过油漆的陈旧家具，还有一台半导体收音机，别无所有。他对应该享受的包括高级居室和小轿车在内的所有优厚待遇都一概拒绝，对自己的儿孙坚持进行勤俭教育和热爱农村教育，而对帮助别人解除困难和出力建设家乡则在所不惜。这方面的感人事例举不胜举：家乡少医，他花钱送乡村医生进修；乡亲缺药，他买药供用；一孤寡老人一直由他抚养；一烈士女儿出嫁，他代表牺牲了的老战友送去贺礼；一妇女难产，他给资助；一农民家中失火，他送钱救急；为促成公路修通，他为路工拿出慰问金；远道来找他反映问题、伸冤告状的人缺少路费，他热情帮助……。为了建设家乡，他不仅积极主动地出谋献策，还出钱为集体买牛、买猪、买急需的农用物资、修理保管室、修路、架桥、植树造林、办工厂，特别是为了家乡集资办电，他慷慨解囊，捐助14900元，还策杖奔走在青山绿水间，从勘测设计到施工付出了自己的精力，直到6座小水电站建成发电。
    喻杰同志的遗产仅有几间平房和一个800元的储蓄存折，却给家乡留下了平坦的乡间道路、丛密的田园山林、还有一座座工厂……，尤其是给全国人民留下了珍贵的精神财富，人民将永远怀念他。
