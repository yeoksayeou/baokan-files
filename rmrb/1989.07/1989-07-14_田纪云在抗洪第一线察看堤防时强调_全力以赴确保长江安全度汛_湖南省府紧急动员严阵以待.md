Vice Premier and Commander-in-Chief of the State Flood Control Headquarters Tian Jiyun, who is currently inspecting the Yangtze River dikes on the front lines of flood control, stressed that the current focus of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the entire nation is on the safety of the Yangtze River dikes. Party committees and governments at all levels along the river must mobilize forces, take personal command, and throw themselves wholeheartedly into the flood control battle to ensure the safe passage of the Yangtze River through the flood season.

In recent days, heavy rains have fallen in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, causing the river to surge in the middle and lower reaches. Currently, more than 300,000 people are engaged in flood control along the banks of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province. From July 12 to 14, Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and Minister of Water Resources Yang Zhenhui, along with leaders from Hubei Province, inspected the dikes in Wuhan City and key flood control sections of the Yangtze River, such as the Jingjiang Great Dike. In Wuhan, he also listened to a report from the responsible person of the Hunan Province Flood Control Headquarters and, aboard a helicopter, inspected the flood control situation in Anxiang and Yueyang in the Dongting Lake area of Hunan Province, observing the important dikes along the southern line of the Yangtze River and in the Dongting Lake area, as well as key dikes protecting villages.

Tian Jiyun pointed out that ensuring the safety of the Yangtze River requires concrete flood control and flood fighting measures. First, leaders at all levels must take personal responsibility and implement a system of leadership responsibility, which is very important. Second, the flood control teams must be in place, with a combat-ready force that can be called upon at any moment, is well-organized, and follows orders precisely. In the most critical sections of the dikes, we must rely on the People's Liberation Army. Whether facing floods or fires, the PLA has always played a major role in disaster relief and is our mainstay. Third, flood control materials and equipment must be in place and can be dispatched immediately when needed. Commercial and material supply departments must conduct thorough checks, clearly defining the storage locations and dispatch methods for materials. Fourth, communication must be smooth. Each department must clearly define responsibilities, work closely together, and hold accountable those who cause problems.

Tian Jiyun said that flood conditions can change unpredictably, and in flood control, we must not be complacent, tightening up at the front and relaxing at the back. We must remain vigilant and strive for a comprehensive victory in this year's flood control efforts.

The Hunan Provincial Government held an emergency telephone conference this evening, requiring leaders at all levels to immediately rush to the flood control front lines, organize rescue battles; effectively organize flood control and rescue teams, implement a responsibility system for defense; urgently transport flood control equipment, prepare rescue materials; speed up the handling of dangerous sections, ensure the safety of dikes; quickly implement emergency measures for breaches and water diversion, and prepare for the safe evacuation of the population.

    田纪云在抗洪第一线察看堤防时强调
    全力以赴确保长江安全度汛
    湖南省府紧急动员严阵以待
    据新华社武汉7月14日电  （记者赵鹏、詹仲德）正在防洪第一线察看长江堤防的国务院副总理、国家防汛总指挥部总指挥田纪云指出，当前党中央、国务院和全国人民都在关注长江堤防安危。沿江各地各级党委和政府要动员力量，亲自指挥，全力以赴地投入抗洪斗争，确保长江安全度汛。
    近日来，长江上游连降大雨，中下游地区江水暴涨。目前，湖北省沿江两岸投入抗洪人力已达30余万。7月12日至14日，田纪云副总理和水利部部长杨振怀以及湖北省领导同志，先后察看了武汉市堤防和长江防汛重点地段荆江大堤。在武汉，他还听取了湖南省防汛指挥部负责人的汇报，并乘直升飞机察看了湖南洞庭湖区安乡、岳阳等地防汛情况，观察长江南线大堤、洞庭湖区重要堤防及重点民垸。
    田纪云指出，确保长江安全，必须有切实的防汛抗洪措施。首先，各级领导要亲自负责，实行领导负责制，这一条非常重要。二是防汛队伍必须落实，要有一支有战斗力的防汛队伍，召之即来，来之能战，组织严密，指挥若定。在最关键堤段要依靠解放军，无论遇到水灾、火灾，解放军在救灾中都出了大力，是我们依靠的主力。三是防汛物资、器材要落实，需要时马上调出。商业、物资部门要认真检查，明确物资存放地点和调度方法。四是通讯联系要畅通。各部门之间要明确责任，密切协作，谁出了问题，就追究谁的责任。
    田纪云说，汛情变化，有时难以预料，在防汛中不可心存侥幸，前紧后松，要坚持不懈，高度警惕，为夺取今年防汛全面胜利而努力。
    本报长沙7月14日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省政府今晚召开紧急电话会议，要求各级领导立即奔赴抗洪前线，组织抢险战斗；切实组织好防汛抢险队伍，落实防守责任制；抓紧调运防汛器材，做好抢险物资准备；加快险工险段的处理，确保堤防安全；迅速落实好一旦溃堤和分蓄洪水的安全应急措施，做好群众安全撤退的准备工作。
