Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 2nd

Recently, CCTV broadcasted a video of six soldiers from the capital's martial law troops being burned to death by rioters, which infuriated millions of viewers in front of their TVs.

Now, the intersection of Chaoyang Road in Beijing, where the brave soldiers sacrificed their lives, has trees scorched by the flames hanging with couplets: "Calming the riots, names will be remembered in history; Sacrificing in the capital, fame will last for a thousand years." Below the couplets, layers of wreaths and flower baskets surround the martyrs' portraits. The black frames with solemn ink marks indicate the names of the martyrs: Wang Qifu, Du Huaiqing, Li Dongguo, Li Qiang, Wang Xiaobing, and Xu Rujun.

It was around 1 a.m. on June 4th when Wang Qifu and nine other soldiers boarded a Liberation-brand truck loaded with riot control equipment, heading towards Tiananmen Square to carry out their mission. When the truck reached the intersection of Chaoyang Road, it was intercepted by a group of thugs and uninformed crowds. At that moment, four military vehicles on both sides of the intersection were already on fire, with thick smoke and blazing flames. Seeing a military vehicle approaching from the south, the rioters shouted, "Stop the military vehicle, burn them to death!" Instantly, stones, bricks, and soda bottles rained down on the truck like bullets, and the crowd surged onto the road. To avoid injuring the crowd, the driver had to slow down. The thugs took the opportunity to throw Molotov cocktails onto the vehicle and scatter nails on the ground, puncturing the truck's left rear tire. When the truck tried to turn right, it tilted to the left and overturned. Seeing this, the rioters swarmed over, throwing torches and gasoline bombs onto the truck. In an instant, the truck's canopy caught fire, and the equipment inside the compartment ignited. Four soldiers in the back of the truck struggled to free themselves from the equipment pressing down on them and crawled out of the flames. They braved the flying stones and burning objects, desperately trying to rescue their comrades trapped inside the compartment. However, the rioters, emboldened, blocked their way. Soon, the fierce fire caused the fuel tank to explode, and six soldiers were burned alive in the raging flames.

The six martyrs, in defense of the capital and the Party Central Committee, wrote a heroic song of revolutionary heroism with their young lives, demonstrating their boundless loyalty to the motherland.

When the motherland needs them, revolutionary soldiers must stand at the forefront. This was the principle of action for the six martyrs. Since April, the unrest in the capital had weighed heavily on their minds. Before coming to Beijing to carry out their mission, Du Huaiqing had accompanied his brother, who was on a business trip, to visit Tiananmen Square. He saw the solemn square filled with people sitting and demonstrating, and his heart was heavy. After the order to impose martial law in Beijing was issued, he was the first to submit a pledge to the Party organization. Soldier Xu Rujun had received a telegram saying his mother was seriously ill. He worried about his birth mother but was more concerned about the suffering of the motherland due to the unrest, and without hesitation, he went to Beijing with the troops. Wang Qifu and Li Dongguo also voluntarily postponed their return home to get engaged. After the troops entered the gathering area in the suburbs of Beijing, they, despite their fatigue, immediately engaged in intensive emergency training, determined to complete the mission given by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission with a formidable military posture.

On the evening of June 3rd, the higher-ups ordered their unit to send people to the military supply warehouse to pick up equipment for the martial law mission. As soon as they heard there was a mission, everyone volunteered to go. Ten soldiers rushed to the warehouse by car and loaded the equipment as quickly as possible. After the car was loaded, everyone was so tired that they were panting, and their clothes were soaked with sweat. On their way back, the thugs blocked the military vehicle. Stones, soda bottles, and steel bars kept hitting them. The soldiers, unarmed, endured the insults and curses, maintaining a policy of not retaliating with words or fists. When the car maneuvered through the layers of roadblocks and broke out of the encirclement, returning to the base, the ten soldiers were all beaten black and blue. Wang Qifu's face was swollen with a walnut-sized blood clot, and his teeth were loosened. Comrades offered to replace them, but they refused to stay behind.

These soldiers stood at the forefront in times of danger, and in peacetime, for the sake of the motherland, they were also selfless and willing to sacrifice. Wang Xiaobing, after enlisting, was diligent and made significant progress, becoming the training ace of the company and receiving multiple commendations. Several of the six martyrs came from rural families with modest living conditions, but they remained steadfast in their devotion to the country. Du Huaiqing was a four-year veteran. He had served as a cook, animal keeper, and gunner in the company, excelling in every role. His parents were ill, and the family faced many difficulties. When the old soldiers were demobilized this year, the organization decided to keep him in service, and he happily complied without asking for any conditions, always taking the lead in various tasks and playing a key role.

These six martyrs had beautiful ideals. They were young and had just started their journey in life when they sacrificed themselves bravely while carrying out the sacred martial law mission. The heroes fell in the flames, but their noble revolutionary spirit will live on forever.

    烈火中永生
    ——记翠微路口六烈士
    新华社通讯员　新华社记者
    不久前，中央电视台播映了首都戒严部队6位战士惨遭暴徒焚烧致死的录相，电视机前的亿万观众无不义愤填膺。
    如今，勇士们壮烈献身的北京翠微路口，被烈火燎过的树杆上悬挂着一幅幅挽联：平息暴乱名垂青史，捐躯京都流芳千古。挽联下，重重叠叠的花圈、花篮簇拥着烈士的遗像，黑框下凝重的墨迹标示着烈士的英名：王其富、杜怀庆、李栋国、李强、王小兵、徐如军。
    那是6月4日凌晨1时许，王其富等10名战士登上满载防暴器材的解放牌汽车，前往天安门广场方向执行任务。汽车行至翠微路口，遭到一群歹徒和不明真相的群众围截。此刻，路口两侧已有4辆军车在燃烧，浓烟滚滚，火光冲天。暴徒们见从南面驶来一辆军车，便狂喊着：“拦住军车，烧死他们！”霎时间，石头、砖块、汽水瓶雨点似的朝汽车袭来，人群蜂拥到公路上。为了不压伤群众，司机不得不减缓车速。歹徒则乘机向车上投掷燃烧瓶，往地上扔三角钉，扎破了汽车的左后轮胎。当汽车向右拐弯时，车身却向左倾斜翻倒了。暴徒见状，一拥而上，丧心病狂地将火把、汽油瓶扔到汽车上。顷刻间，汽车篷布呼地燃着了，车厢里的器材起火了。坐在车厢后面的4名战士奋力挣脱压在身上的器材，从烈火中爬了出来。他们冒着纷飞的石块和燃烧物，拚命抢救被挤压在车厢内的战友。但是，暴徒们有恃无恐，极力阻拦。不一会，凶猛的火势引起油箱爆炸，6名战士活活地被熊熊烈火吞噬了。
    六烈士为保卫首都、捍卫党中央，用年轻的生命谱写了一曲革命英雄主义的壮歌，表现出对祖国的无限忠贞。
    当祖国需要的时候，革命战士就要站在最前列，这是六烈士的行动准则。今年4月以来，首都发生的动乱牵动着他们的心。来京执行任务之前，杜怀庆曾陪着出差的哥哥来到天安门广场游览。他看到庄严的广场被静坐示威的人搞得乌烟瘴气，心情非常沉重。部队接到赴京戒严的命令后，他首先向党组织递交了决心书。战士徐如军曾收到“母亲病重”的电报，他挂念生身之母，更为祖国母亲遭受动乱之苦焦心，毫不犹豫地随部队赴京。王其富、李栋国也主动推迟了回家订婚的时间。部队进入京郊集结地域后，他们不顾疲劳，立即投入紧张的应急训练，决心以威武的军姿，圆满完成党中央和中央军委赋予的任务。
    6月3日晚，上级让他们部队派人到军需仓库领运执行戒严任务的器材。一听说有任务，大伙儿都抢着去。10名战士乘车赶到仓库，以最快的速度装载。车装好后，每人都累得直喘粗气，身上的衣服全被汗水湿透。返回途中，暴徒们见军车就拦堵。石块、汽水瓶、钢筋棍不断朝他们砸来。战士们赤手空拳，忍受着凌辱和谩骂，坚持骂不还口，打不还手。当汽车绕过层层路障，冲出包围圈，返回驻地时，10名战士身上都被打得青一块紫一块。王其富脸上被打得肿起一个核桃大的血包，牙齿也被打松，战友们争着要替换他们，但他们谁也不肯留下。
    这些战士在危急关头冲在前，平时为了祖国需要，也是公而忘私，乐于奉献。王小兵入伍后好学上进，成了连队军事训练尖子，多次受到嘉奖。6位烈士中，有好几位家居农村，家庭生活尚不富裕，但他们以国为怀志不移。杜怀庆是位入伍4年的老战士。他在连队当过炊事员、饲养员、炮手，干一行爱一行专一行。他父母患病，家庭有不少困难。今年老兵退伍时，组织上决定他继续服役，他不讲任何价钱，愉快地服从组织安排，而且各项工作都走在头里，处处发挥骨干作用。
    这6位烈士都有美好的理想。他们年纪轻轻的，刚踏上人生的征途，就在执行神圣的戒严任务中英勇捐躯。英雄在烈火中倒下了，他们的高尚革命情操永驻人间。
