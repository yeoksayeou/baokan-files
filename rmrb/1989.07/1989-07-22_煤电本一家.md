	Coal and electricity are essentially one family, collectively known as energy. The former is called primary energy, and the latter is called secondary energy. Converting coal into electrical energy generates greater economic benefits; power plants that rely on coal need a sufficient supply of coal to operate at full capacity. Coal and electricity are interconnected, each dependent on the other.

	It is unclear when exactly this happened, but in China, coal and electricity have been separated, and the division is quite clear. In the same locality, coal and electricity are divided into different sectors, each operating independently, with no coordination between them. In one city, there is an astonishing phenomenon: a power plant and a coal mine are separated by just a wall, but the power plant cannot obtain coal from the nearby mine and has to transport coal from thousands of miles away. At the same time, the construction of power plants and coal mines is not planned and designed together, each doing its own thing, resulting in the duplication of public facilities, excessive land use, and wasted investment.

	Coal and electricity working together have many advantages. It facilitates the rational combination of production factors, strengthens production and operation management, reduces operating costs, and is a crucial strategic measure for saving energy investment and rationally laying out energy construction.

	Some comrades, influenced by departmental divisions, do not fully recognize the importance of coal and electricity working together. They only consider the benefits of their own departments and do not consider the overall social benefits. They are concerned that their department will suffer a loss after working together. This mindset, which only considers the local interests of one's own department and ignores the overall situation, is the main obstacle to achieving coal and electricity working together.

	Of course, coal and electricity have been separated for a long time, and now it will take a lot of work to bring them together. In particular, it is necessary to distinguish between different situations, classify guidance, and gradually promote the initiative. It is not possible to force a match, nor is it possible to leave it unmanaged. For new coal mines and power plants, as long as conditions permit, they should be planned and designed together from the beginning, built simultaneously, and operated as a closely integrated economic entity. For old coal mines and power plants, if conditions are met, they should be operated together on the principle of mutual benefit and voluntariness. In terms of management systems, it can be electricity-led or coal-led, or both sides can form a board of directors based on their investment amounts. As long as it is beneficial to the operation, why bother who is in charge.

### 煤电本一家

    煤电本一家
    燮阳
    煤和电本一家，统称能源。前者叫一次能源，后者叫二次能源。煤炭转化为电能产生更大的经济效益；靠煤发电的厂有充足的煤，才能满负荷发电。煤电相连，谁也离不开谁。
    也不知从什么时候起，我国的煤和电分了家，而且分得很清楚。同一个地方，煤电条块分割，画地为牢，谁也不管谁。有个市竟出现了这样奇怪的现象，电厂和煤矿一墙之隔，电厂用煤不能就近供应，却要千里迢迢到外地去拉煤。同时，建设电厂和煤矿，不统一进行规划和设计，各搞一套，重复建设公用设施，以致多占土地，浪费投资。
    煤电联营好处就多了，它有利生产要素的合理组合，有利于加强生产经营管理，有利于降低运营成本，是节约能源投资、合理布局能源建设的一项重要战略措施。
    少数同志由于受部门分割的影响，对煤电联营的重要性认识不足。他们只算本部门利益账，不算社会效益账，耽心的是联营后本部门吃了亏。这种只顾本部门的局部利益不顾大局的思想是实现煤电联营的主要障碍。
    当然，煤电两家分离已久，现在要联营起来，还有很多工作要做。特别是要区别情况，分类指导，逐步推开。不能强行搞拉郎配，也不能放任不管。对于新建煤矿和电厂，凡是有条件的，要从前期工作开始就应该统一规划，统一设计，同步建设，办成紧密联营的经济实体。对于老煤矿、老电厂，条件具备的，本着自愿互利的原则实行联营。在管理体制上，可以以电为主，也可以以煤为主，有的可以由煤电双方按投资额组成董事会，只要对联营有利，何必争谁当家。
