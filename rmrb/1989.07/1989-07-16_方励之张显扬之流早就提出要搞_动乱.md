After the publication of the editorial "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" in the People's Daily on April 26, it received enthusiastic support and approval from the broad masses of cadres and the people. However, the plotters of the turmoil were enraged and made a great fuss, opposing the editorial, especially fiercely opposing the term "turmoil." Why do those who plot and create turmoil dread the term "turmoil," fear mentioning "turmoil," and yet use various means to escalate the turmoil to oppose the term "turmoil"?

Is the editorial's characterization of the turmoil an injustice to them? Let us examine whether the editorial's arguments are based on facts.

"A small number of people took the opportunity to spread rumors, attacking by name the Party and state leaders; they incited the masses to rush the gates of Zhongnanhai, the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council; some even shouted reactionary slogans like 'overthrow the Communist Party.'" Are these not facts that everyone can see?

"In Xi'an and Changsha, some lawless elements committed serious acts of beating, smashing, looting, and burning." Can these facts be casually denied?

"Spreading various rumors, confusing people's minds, using big and small posters to slander, insult, and attack Party and state leaders; openly violating the constitution, inciting opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system." All of this is still fresh in our minds, in black and white, who can say these are not facts?

As for "in some universities, illegal organizations were established, seizing power from the student unions; in some universities, students were incited to go on strike, teachers to stop teaching, and even forcibly preventing classmates from attending classes; using the name of workers' organizations to distribute reactionary leaflets; and traveling around to create bigger incidents," this is almost known to everyone. Moreover, it should be said that the actual situation at the time was even more serious than what is listed here.

Since all of this is indisputable fact, then what reason is there not to allow the People's Daily editorial to characterize the turmoil appropriately based on these facts?

In fact, it was not the People's Daily editorial that first proposed "turmoil." Long before the editorial pointed out the nature of the situation based on the facts at the time, there were already people brewing turmoil and openly discussing "turmoil."

Let us recall some facts.

Without mentioning the famous Fang Lizhi, who as early as 1986 loudly called for people to "poke" the Party and the government, to "move," and in 1987 and 1988 repeatedly incited the use of "some radical methods" to "seize" democracy, and this year in January declared "we must act"; let us listen to a so-called "elite" named Zhang Xianyang, who on February 15 of this year told Wang Dan, who later became the head of the "Beida Autonomous Federation," the following words: "Marxism does not fit China's national conditions, the current political system must be abolished, and the Chinese people must experience several lessons, such as social turmoil, etc."

Obviously, Zhang Xianyang, in order to negate Marxism and "abolish" China's socialist system, clearly proposed the need for "turmoil." Incidentally, Zhang Xianyang is a researcher at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. This person was found in 1987 to have committed "three kinds of people" errors during the "ten years of turmoil" of the Cultural Revolution. Being identified as a "three kinds of person" and expelled from the Party, he is an old hand at creating turmoil. His bourgeois liberalization speeches at the time were already quite systematic. Now, his heart for creating turmoil in China has not died, and two months before this turmoil, he openly proposed "turmoil" to Peking University student Wang Dan.

On February 28 of this year, another "elite" also had a conversation with Wang Dan. During the conversation, they "agreed that this year would probably not pass, it would definitely be chaotic." Chaos, meaning turmoil. To create turmoil, this person also told Wang Dan that he "believes that underground newspapers should be published now to propagate oppositional thoughts, and emphasizes that human rights should be prioritized." Here, the specific means to create turmoil have already been planned.

By around April 20, when this student movement had just begun, Fang Lizhi, in a telephone interview with a reporter from a Hong Kong news organization, spoke even more openly and definitively. Fang Lizhi proudly said: "If the Communist Party does not have an honest dialogue with the students, then the situation will not be optimistic, and it may even evolve into turmoil." On April 21, Beijing Agricultural University posted a small poster, quoting another famous "elite" Jin Guantao's "judgment" - "Any organization will produce unorganized forces, whose mission is to disrupt and destroy the existence of the organization," claiming that "the Communist Party is an organization that is about to collapse today," and shouting: "China is in great chaos. The Communist Party is in danger. Everyone, watch and wait." On April 23, another small poster appeared in the "Triangle Area" of Peking University, with the title itself being "The Movement has begun!!!" Is this not directly quoting the language of the madman in the movie "Hibiscus Town" calling for the Cultural Revolution after the ten years of turmoil? All these incitements to turmoil were earlier than the People's Daily "April 26" editorial by several days.

The facts are as follows. The plotters of the turmoil had long proposed "turmoil." However, when the People's Daily editorial truthfully pointed out that the nature of the problem at the time was turmoil, exposing their true colors, they were not satisfied, they wanted to attack, they wanted to use this as an excuse to add fuel to the fire of the turmoil they had created, making the turmoil even more escalated.

In summary, this turmoil that evolved from the student movement into a counter-revolutionary riot was indeed, under the incitement and clamor of this group of instigators and organizers, step by step becoming more and more intense. For example, at the beginning of the student movement, Mr. Fang Lizhi's wife, Li Shuxian, gave advice to the heads of the "Beida Autonomous Federation": "You should go to Zhongnanhai to sit in, and if necessary, push in. As long as the police dare to interfere, beat them up, this way you can arouse the sympathy of the students, especially the female students." As a result, two incidents of storming and many days of besieging the location of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, Zhongnanhai, indeed occurred. On the eve of the suppression of this turmoil, the head of the "Beida Autonomous Federation," who was hailed by foreign media as the "leader of the student movement," Chai Ling, still said to an ABC reporter on the scene of the student sit-in at Tiananmen Square: "Students keep asking me, what is our next step?" "I cannot tell them: the next step is bloodshed. Only by washing Tiananmen Square with blood can the entire Chinese people be awakened." After hearing Chai Ling's words, it is not difficult to understand why, although there was no "bloodshed in Tiananmen Square" incident later, there was a widespread lie of "bloodshed in Tiananmen Square" both domestically and internationally. Originally, this was the need of the plotters of the turmoil and riot. They need such things, strive to create such facts; if they cannot create them, they will not stop, and they can only resort to rumors, and even well-coordinated big rumors. Therefore, it is no wonder that Chai Ling's thoughts "cannot be told" to the students on the square who were prepared to be sacrificial lambs, but could only be leaked to foreign reporters in advance.

Conspiracies cannot stand the light of day. Those who create turmoil fear being exposed, fearing that their conspiracies will be exposed and they will not be able to deceive the masses, and they will not be able to create a bigger turmoil. However, their counter-revolutionary goals determine that they must use various means to promote the continuous escalation of the turmoil, until they launch a counter-revolutionary riot. When the plot is revealed, these conspirators have no more appeal. The price is certainly heavy, but the lesson for the people is profound.

    方励之张显扬之流早就提出要搞“动乱”
    赵前
    《人民日报》4月26日社论《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》发表以后，受到广大干部群众的热烈赞同和拥护。然而，动乱的策划者们却气急败坏，大肆鼓噪，反对这篇社论，尤其拚命反对“动乱”这两个字。策划和制造动乱的人，为什么那样讳言“动乱”，怕说“动乱”，而又采用种种使动乱升级的手段，来反对“动乱”这两个字？
    难道社论对于动乱的定性“委屈”了他们吗？那就让我们来看看社论的论据是不是事实。
    “极少数人借机制造谣言，指名攻击党和国家领导人；蛊惑群众冲击党中央、国务院所在地中南海新华门；甚至还有人喊出了打倒共产党等反动口号”。这些难道不是有目共睹的事实吗？
    “在西安、长沙发生了一些不法分子打、砸、抢、烧的严重事件”。这些事实是能够随意否定的？
    “制造种种谣言，蛊惑人心，利用大小字报污蔑、谩骂、攻击党和国家领导人；公然违反宪法，鼓动反对共产党的领导和社会主义制度”。这一切，言犹在耳，白纸黑字，谁又能说它们不是事实？
    至于说到“在一部分高等学校中成立非法组织，向学生会‘夺权’，有的甚至抢占学校广播室；在有的高等学校中鼓动学生罢课、教师罢教，甚至强行阻止同学上课；盗用工人组织的名义，散发反动传单；并且四处串联，企图制造更大的事端”，就更是几乎尽人皆知的事实了。而且应该说，当时的实际情况比这里所列举的，是大有过之而无不及的。
    既然这一切都是确凿无疑的事实，那么，有什么理由不许《人民日报》社论依据这些事实，对动乱作出恰如其分的定性呢？
    其实，首先提出“动乱”的并非《人民日报》社论。早在社论依据当时的事态指明问题的性质之前好久，就已经有人在酝酿动乱、并对“动乱”二字直言不讳了。
    让我们回顾一下，略举一些事实。
    且不说那位大名鼎鼎的方励之，早在1986年就大声疾呼要人们对党和政府“捅一捅”，“动作动作”，在1987、1988连续两年屡屡鼓动要“用一些激烈的方式”“夺取”民主，今年1月份又扬言“必须行动”；让我们听听一位名叫张显扬的“精英”人物，在今年2月15日对后来成为“高自联”头头王丹讲的一番话吧。他说：“马克思主义根本不符合中国国情，现行的政治体制必须废除，中国人还要经历几次教训，诸如社会动乱等。”
    很显然，张显扬为了否定马克思主义，“废除”中国的社会主义制度，明白无误地提出是需要“动乱”的了。顺便说说，张显扬其人，是中国社会科学院马列所的研究员。此人在1987年被查明在“文革”十年动乱中犯有“三种人”错误。被定为“三种人”而清除出党，是个搞动乱的老手了。他的资产阶级自由化言论在当时就很成系统。而今，他在中国搞动乱之心仍不死，在这次动乱发生之前两个月，他就同北大学生王丹毫不含糊地提出“动乱”来了。
    今年2月28日，另一位“精英”人物还同王丹有过一番交谈。交谈中，他们“一致认为，今年恐怕过不去，一定会乱”。乱者，动乱也。为了搞动乱，此人还对王丹说，他“认为现在应该出一些地下小报，宣传反对派思想，并强调应首先以人权为重。”在这里，连搞动乱的具体手段都已筹划出来。
    到了今年4月20日前后，也就是这次学潮刚开始不久，方励之在接受香港某新闻单位记者的电话采访时，就讲得更加直露而肯定了。方励之得意地说：“中共若不与学生坦诚对话，那么形势就不容乐观，甚至会演变成为动乱。”4月21日，北京农业大学贴出一张小字报，文中引用了另一位著名“精英”金观涛的一个“论断”——“任何一个组织都要产生无组织力量，其使命是动荡和摧毁该组织的存在”，声称“中共今日正是一个即将溃灭之组织”，并且呼喊：“中国大乱之至。中共危亡在日。诸位拭目以待之。”4月23日，在北京大学“三角地”出现了另一张小字报，标题本身就是《运动了！！！》，这不就是直接引用电影《芙蓉镇》结束时那位疯人在十年动乱之后呼唤“文革”的语言吗？所有这些煽动动乱的言词，都比《人民日报》“4·26”社论要早好些天。
    事实就是这样。策划动乱的人早就提出“动乱”。但是，当《人民日报》社论实事求是地指出当时问题的性质是动乱的时候，揭了他们的底，他们就不答应了，就要鸣鼓而攻之了，就要借题发挥，给他们搞起的动乱火上浇油，使动乱更加升级了。
    总之，这场由学潮演化而成的动乱乃至反革命暴乱，正是在这伙策动者组织者的煽动、鼓噪下，一步步愈演愈烈的。比如，学潮开始时，方励之先生的妻子李淑娴就曾给“高自联”头头出主意说：“要到新华门静坐，必要时往里挤，只要警察敢管，就是打人，这样才能唤起同学的同情心，特别是女同学。”于是，果然发生了两次冲击和多日围困党中央和国务院所在地新华门的严重事件。到这场动乱被平息的前夕，被外电捧为“学运领袖”的“高自联”头头柴玲，在天安门广场学生静坐现场还对美国广播公司记者说过这样一番话：“同学们不断问我，我们下一步是什么。”“我不能告诉他们：下一步是流血。唯有血洗天安门，整个中国人民才能被唤醒。”听了柴玲的这一番话，就不难明白，为什么明明后来没有发生“血洗天安门”的事件，却中外呼应，一起造出了“血洗天安门”的弥天大谎来。原来，这是动乱和暴乱的策划者的需要。他们需要这样的东西，想努力造成这样的事实；造不成也不罢休，还要——也只能乞灵于谣言，而且是互相配合好了来造的大谣言。这就无怪乎柴玲这样的想法“不能告诉”广场上那些准备当牺牲品的同学，而只能事先透露给外国记者。
    阴谋见不得阳光。制造动乱者怕人说他们搞动乱，怕的就是暴露了阴谋骗不了群众，搞不成更大的动乱。但是，他们的反革命目的决定了他们必是要采取种种手段，促使动乱不断升级，直至发动反革命暴乱。图穷匕首见。当人们终于看清事情的真相时，这一伙阴谋家就再也没有什么号召力了。代价当然是沉痛的，但是给予人们的教训也是深刻的。
