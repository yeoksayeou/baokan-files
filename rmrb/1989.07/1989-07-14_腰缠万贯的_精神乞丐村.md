The village of Luojiapo in Mazhadian Town, Zhushan County, has, over the past decade, utilized local resources to mine and process jade, exporting it both domestically and internationally, making this village the richest in the county. Out of the village's 390 households, 71 have assets exceeding one million yuan, including one with 50 million yuan, five with over 10 million yuan, and 65 with assets ranging from one to nine million yuan. Over 140 households have built new homes, and high-end household appliances have become common in rural families. Additionally, 20 households employ maids and cooks. However, due to the weakening of ideological and political work and the relaxation of education for farmers, the moral and ethical standards of some villagers have declined, turning them into wealthy but spiritually impoverished "spiritual beggars."

The sense of national and collective responsibility has faded. Before 1979, Luojiapo village borrowed 42,000 yuan from the state, which has yet to be repaid; 135,000 yuan in contract fulfillment funds for five years has also not been paid. The collective has become an empty shell. Village cadre salaries and village activity funds are covered by fines for overpopulation. In December 1988, relevant departments discovered that the village had evaded 19,000 yuan in taxes; that year, all village households owed the state 3,200 yuan in electricity fees. The power supply department cut off the village's electricity for half a year. The former village secretary, who earned 200,000 yuan, did not pay the 135 yuan electricity bill. The new village secretary and director, upon taking office, used their own money to pay off the village's overdue electricity fees, allowing the power supply to resume.

Party members are reluctant to become village cadres, and the leadership team changes frequently. Over the past decade, the village leadership team has been replaced 11 times, with the shortest term being three village party branch secretaries in one year and the longest being one year and a half. The reason is that the income from being a village cadre is not as high as from a single trip to trade jade. Among the cadres, the saying "If you want to get rich, don't be a village cadre" is popular.

Social order is chaotic. In recent years, Luojiapo has seen an average of over 100 criminal and civil cases each year. Some brothers have fought over the mining of jade, destroying each other's property. Some wealthy farmers engage in gambling, and some even visit prostitutes. In 1988, 32 people from this village were detained or fined for gambling and prostitution.

Public welfare projects like water conservancy and roads have been severely damaged. Luojiapo village has 4,700 meters of weirs and spillways, all of which have been destroyed and privately occupied. The village's roads have also been occupied and damaged by villagers building houses, making transportation reliant on shoulder-carrying and back-carrying. Villagers are full of complaints.

Overpopulation is a common problem. No household has obtained a single-child certificate. Out of 240 couples of childbearing age, 54 have three or four children, and having two children is very common. Villager Luo Shu-ying already has three children. When the village urged him to get a vasectomy, he said, "Now they talk about fines, right? As long as they let my wife give birth, I'll pay whatever fine they ask." Last year, his wife gave birth to her fourth child and was fined 800 yuan.

Random construction of private houses has led to a sharp decrease in arable land. In 1978, Luojiapo village had 1,120 mu of arable land, with 0.88 mu per person. By 1988, the village's arable land had decreased to 1,006 mu, with 0.62 mu per person, and 114 mu of land was occupied by private house construction. The former party branch secretary, Zhang Zongfeng, not only built a two-story house with 10 rooms for himself but also built a house for each of his two sons, who were still in their teens. Some people built houses occupying more than one mu of land, creating flower beds and fish ponds.

The new socialist ethos has faded. This village has 38 impoverished households, including 16 severely impoverished ones. These families include mentally disabled, disabled, labor-less, and skill-less individuals. The wealthy not only do not help them but also discriminate against them. These impoverished households can only farm, but they cannot afford fertilizer and pesticides, yet no millionaire helps them solve this problem, saying they are useless.

### 腰缠万贯的“精神乞丐村”

    腰缠万贯的“精神乞丐村”
    竹山县麻家渡镇罗家坡村，在这10年来，利用本地资源，开采、加工绿松石，远销国内外，使这个村成为全县最富裕的村。全村390户，万元以上的有71户，其中50万元的1户、10万元以上的5户，1至9万元的65户。建新房的140多户，高档家用电器都进了农家。还有20家农户雇有保姆、厨师。但是，由于这个村削弱了思想政治工作，放松了对农民的教育，一些农民的思想道德水准却下降了，成为腰缠万贯、思想空虚的“精神乞丐”。
    国家观念、集体观念淡薄。罗家坡村1979年以前向国家贷款4.2万元，至今没有归还；5年合同兑现款13.5万元，也分文不交。集体成了空架子。村干部工资和村活动经费靠收来的超生子女费垫支。1988年12月，有关部门一次查出这个村偷漏税1.9万元；当年全村农户欠国家电费3200元。供电部门停这个村电半年，原任书记是收入20万元的大户，连13.5元电费都不交。新任书记、主任到职后，拿出自己的钱交清了全村拖欠的电费，供电部门才供电。
    党员不愿当村干部，领导班子变化频繁。近10年来，村领导班子更换了11次，最短的一年换3任村党支部书记，最长的当一年多。原因是，当村干部的收入不如跑一趟绿松石生意多。干部中流传着“要想富，莫当村干部”的口头禅。
    社会秩序混乱。近几年来，罗家坡每年平均发生治安、民事案件100多起。有的同胞兄弟也为采挖绿松石发生纠纷，互相殴打，砸烂家产。有的农民富裕之后大肆赌博，甚至有的嫖娼。1988年，这个村因赌博、嫖娼被收审、罚款的就有32人。
    水利、公路等公益事业破坏严重。罗家坡村有堰渠、溢洪道4700米，全部被破坏和私占。这个村的公路，也被村民建房占用和挖毁，运输全靠肩挑背驮，村民怨声载道。
    超计划生育现象普遍。全村没有一户领取独生子女证。240对育龄夫妇，生三四胎的有54对，生两胎的十分普遍。村民罗述应已有3个孩子，村里动员他结扎，他说：“现在不是讲罚款吗？只要让我老婆生，要多少钱交多少。”去年，他妻子生了第4胎，被罚款800元。
    乱建私房，耕地锐减。罗家坡村1978年有耕地1120亩，人均0.88亩。1988年全村耕地减少到1006亩，人均0.62亩，建私房占地114亩。原党支部书记张宗凤，不仅自己建10间两层楼房，还为才十几岁的两个儿子各建一栋房子。有的建房围地一亩多，修花坛、鱼池。
    社会主义新风尚淡化。这个村有38家贫困户，其中特困户16家。这些人家中，有的是痴呆人、残疾人，有的无劳力，有的无技术。富裕的人们不仅不带不帮，还歧视他们。这些贫困户只会务农，但连肥料、农药都无钱买，却没有一个万元户帮他们解决，还说他们无用。
