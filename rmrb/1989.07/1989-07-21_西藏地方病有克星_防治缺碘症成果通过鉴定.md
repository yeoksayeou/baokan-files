    A Cure for Tibetan Endemic Diseases: Iodine Deficiency Prevention Achieves Results

    LAHSA, July 21 (Xinhua) — The domestically and internationally pioneering research on adding iodine to tea bricks to prevent iodine deficiency diseases has recently passed the appraisal in Lhasa.

    Iodine deficiency goiter is a globally prevalent disease. China is also a region with a high incidence of goiter, particularly in Xinjiang and Tibet. Based on the Tibetan residents' habit of drinking tea year-round, the Tibet Autonomous Region Health Department's Endemic Disease Prevention and Control Office and the Chinese Endemic Disease Control Center jointly conducted a year and two months of research and field trials. The appraisal concluded that adding iodine to tea bricks does not alter the quality of the tea and has no side effects.

    西藏地方病有克星
    防治缺碘症成果通过鉴定
    本报拉萨7月21日电　记者刘伟报道：国内外首创的茶砖加碘防治碘缺乏疾病科研成果，近日在拉萨通过鉴定。
    碘缺泛甲状腺肿大是世界性流行疾病。我国亦是甲状腺肿大疾病多发地区，其中尤以新疆、西藏为甚。根据西藏居民常年饮茶的习惯，由西藏卫生厅地病防疫处和中国地病防治中心主持，进行了1年零2月的科研和实地试验。经鉴定，茶砖加碘不改变茶叶质地，亦无副作用。
