Tianjin has undergone significant changes in recent years, not just relying on money, but mainly on everyone's hands. Carrying forward this tradition, many problems can be solved. On July 6, Tianjin's leaders, who participated in road repair despite the rain, made this assessment of the voluntary labor that has become a widespread practice here.

Voluntary labor in some units in Tianjin has the following characteristics:

	— Emphasis on effectiveness. Cadres of Tianjin Alkali Factory often take turns entering the lime kiln at 140 degrees Celsius to remove lumps, ensuring continuous production.

	— Emphasis on dedication. Since March, 13,000 party members in Hebei District have used their spare time to voluntarily build a 6,300-meter park for people to rest. Recently named "Party Members' Dedication Park," it has been completed and opened to the public.

	— Institutionalization. Hexi District has established voluntary labor cards for 3,000 cadres, organizing voluntary labor during holidays and major events.

Voluntary labor, which has abandoned the bad practices of "one-time effort, going through the motions, and high subsidies," has played a good role in advocating for hard work, strengthening relations between cadres and the masses, and promoting the "double increase and double savings" campaign.

    城市变化大　主要靠双手
    天津义务劳动成风气
    本报天津电　记者肖荻报道：“天津这几年面貌变化较大，不只靠钱，而主要是靠大家的双手。发扬这个传统，许多问题可以得到解决”。7月6日冒雨参加修路的天津市领导同志，这样评价这里蔚然成风的义务劳动。
    天津市一些单位的义务劳动呈现以下特点：
    ——求实效。天津碱厂干部经常冒140度高温轮流进白灰窑除瘤，保证生产连续进行。
    ——讲奉献。河北区1.3万名党员从3月开始利用业余时间义务修建成6300米公园供行人休憩。日前命名为“党员奉献园”，已落成开放。
    ——制度化。河西区为3000名干部建义务劳动卡，凡节假日和重大活动均组织义务劳动。
    摒弃了“一阵风、走过场、高补贴”陋习的义务劳动，在提倡艰苦奋斗、密切干群关系、推动双增双节等多方面起到了良好作用。
