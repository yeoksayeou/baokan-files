A large-scale land improvement project, funded jointly by the central government and local authorities, is set to commence in Sichuan.

This project, spanning from this year to 1991, aims to transform 4.5 million mu of low-yielding fields in Sichuan Province over three years. The total investment for the project is 540 million yuan, with the agricultural department, Sichuan local finances, and agricultural bank loans each contributing one-third of the total cost.

These low-yielding fields are primarily located in mountainous regions. Upon completion of the project, Sichuan's production of grain, cotton, and oil is expected to increase by 600,000 tons, 29,000 tons, and 59,300 tons respectively, based on the 1988 production levels.
