    Layer-by-Layer Retention of Grain Pre-purchase Deposits in Hengnan County

    This spring, in a situation where the state has tightened monetary policy, bank loans have decreased, and agricultural funds are scarce, a strange phenomenon has emerged in the rural areas of our county: farmers do not want the grain pre-purchase deposits. In just 12 villages in Qitian Township, 7 villages do not want the pre-purchase deposits. Why do farmers not want this money?

    According to an investigation by the county People's Congress Standing Committee joint investigation team, the phenomenon of retaining grain pre-purchase deposits is widespread in various parts of our county. Last year, the county issued over 5.7 million yuan in grain pre-purchase deposits, most of which were diverted for other uses, leaving very little actually reaching the farmers. The Liushi District should have issued 2.14 million yuan in grain pre-purchase deposits, but 1.42 million yuan were retained. In Sihui Village, Longque Township, the village should have received 7,480 yuan in grain pre-purchase deposits, but the township government deducted 3,200 yuan for water fees, 2,500 yuan for outstanding debts, and 1,780 yuan for national savings bonds, leaving the farmers with not a single cent. Qitian Township should have issued 1.479 million yuan in pre-purchase deposits, but the township government decided to allocate 900,000 yuan to the township finance and taxation bureau for fertilizers, and the rest of the grain pre-purchase deposits were used to pay insurance premiums, buy national savings bonds, and settle debts. The credit cooperative in Shangbao Township issued deposit slips to farmers who should have received grain pre-purchase deposits.

    Currently, the county government is taking measures to increase agricultural investment and emphasizes that agricultural funds must be used for their designated purposes. However, the grain pre-purchase deposits are not being implemented, and some townships and villages still divert grain pre-purchase deposits. According to the grain purchase contract, the Lijiang District should have issued 3.88 million yuan in grain pre-purchase deposits this year. As of April 22, this money has not been allocated. Some district and township leaders have made the following arrangements for this year's grain pre-purchase deposits: buying national savings bonds, paying insurance premiums, and deducting outstanding debts.

    衡南县区乡层层截留粮食预购定金
    今年春季，在国家紧缩银根、银行贷款减少、农业资金紧缺的情况下，我县农村却出现了农民不要粮食预购定金的怪现象。仅?田乡12个村，就有7个村不要预购定金。农民为何不要这笔钱呢？
    据县人大常委会联合调查组调查，我县各地截留粮食预购定金现象十分普遍。去年全县发放570多万元粮食预购定金，大部分被挪作它用，真正发到农民手中的所剩无几。硫市区去年应发粮食预购定金21.4万元，但被截留14.2万元。龙确乡四合村去年应发粮食预购定金7480元，可是被乡政府扣除水费3200元，扣除欠款2500元，还扣除国库券款1780元，农民实际上没有拿到一分钱。?田乡去年应发预购定金14.79万元，乡政府决定拿出9万元给乡财税所经营化肥，其它的粮食预购定金交了保险金，买了国库券，还了欠款。上坒乡信用社给应该领取粮食预购定金的农民开存款单。
    目前，县政府正在采取措施增加农业投入，强调农业资金要专款专用，但是，粮食预购定金不落实，一些乡村挪用粮食预购定金的现象仍然存在。栗江区按粮食定购合同计算，今年应发放粮食预购定金38.8万元。直到4月22日止，这笔款还没有着落。一些区、乡领导人对今年的粮食预购定金作了如下安排：买国库券、交保险金、扣欠款。
