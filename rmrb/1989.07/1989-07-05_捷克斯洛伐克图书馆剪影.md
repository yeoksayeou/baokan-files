The construction of libraries in Czechoslovakia is world-class. Whether in bustling cities or remote villages, large and small libraries of various kinds are scattered throughout the country.

The National Library of Czechoslovakia, located on Klementinum Street in the heart of Prague, is the largest and oldest library in the country. Its establishment can be traced back to 1348 when King Charles IV founded the first university in Europe—the Charles University. He personally donated 140 manuscripts to the Charles University, which became the foundation books of the National Library of Czechoslovakia. After more than 600 years of development, the library now holds 5.4 million books, collecting works from various disciplines over the centuries in Czechoslovakia, preserving manuscripts and works by famous Czechoslovakian writers, scientists, and musicians, and storing the earliest published books in Czechoslovakia.

Like the National Library of Czechoslovakia, the Technical Library of Czechoslovakia, the Municipal Library of Prague, and the Central Economic Library of Ostrava are all historically significant and outstanding libraries. In particular, the Technical Library of Czechoslovakia, with a history of over 200 years, houses more than 1.5 million books on social sciences, natural sciences, and technical sciences published across the country over the centuries, making it an important center for economic and scientific information.

Czechoslovakia has a long-standing tradition of valuing library construction, viewing libraries as important venues for preserving national cultural heritage, improving the cultural literacy of the people, and disseminating scientific and cultural knowledge. In 1919, Czechoslovakia enacted its first significant library law, stipulating that every village should establish a library. In 1959, a new national library law was passed, establishing a unified national library system. Currently, this country of 15.5 million people has more than 12,000 libraries, holding over 80 million books, with more than 3 million registered readers. Readers borrow books over 100 million times a year, averaging about 7 books per person. According to UNESCO statistics, Czechoslovakia ranks first in the world in terms of per capita book borrowing.

Libraries across Czechoslovakia enthusiastically serve society and the public, viewing the recruitment of new readers as their sacred duty and the dissemination of knowledge to youth and the masses as their unshirkable responsibility. Czechoslovakian libraries also actively promote nationwide reading activities. Since 1955, libraries across the country have held book month activities every March.

Libraries organize book exhibitions, lectures, and meetings between authors and readers to recommend and introduce contemporary political, economic, and literary books to readers. Many libraries also organize knowledge competitions. (Accompanying photo)

    捷克斯洛伐克图书馆剪影
    孙希有
    捷克斯洛伐克图书馆的建设在世界上堪称一流。无论在繁华的都市，还是偏僻的乡村，大大小小、各种各样的图书馆遍布全国。
    坐落在布拉格市中心克列门丁大街的捷国家图书馆是全国最大、历史最悠久的图书馆。它的创建可追溯到1348年。查理四世国王当时在布拉格创办了欧洲第一所高等学府——查理大学。他亲自为查理大学捐献了140部手稿，成为捷国家图书馆的奠基书。经过600多年的发展，图书馆目前藏书540万册，汇集了捷数百年来各个学科的书籍，保存着捷历史上著名文学家、科学家、音乐家的手稿和著作，珍藏着捷最早发行的图书。
    像捷国家图书馆一样，捷技术图书馆、布拉格市立图书馆、俄拉迪斯拉发中央经济图书馆都是历史悠久、出类拔萃的图书馆。特别是捷技术图书馆，至今已有200多年的历史，珍藏着全国几百年来出版的150余万册社会科学、自然科学和技术科学方面的书籍，成为全国重要的经济和科技情报信息中心。
    捷重视图书馆建设具有历史传统，数百年来一直把图书馆作为保存民族文化遗产、提高人民文化素养、传播科学文化知识的重要场所。1919年，捷通过了第一部具有重大意义的图书馆法。法令规定，每一个村庄都要兴建图书馆。1959年通过了新的国家图书馆法，建立起全国统一的图书馆体系。目前，这个只有1550万人口的国家共有图书馆1.2万余个，藏书8000余万册，拥有固定读者300多万人。读者每年借书量达一亿册次，相当全国人均借书7册。据联合国教科文组织统计，按人均借书量计算。捷在世界上居首位。
    捷全国各地的图书馆热情地为社会和群众服务，把多吸收新的读者作为自己神圣的职责，把向青少年和广大群众传播知识作为自己义不容辞的义务。捷图书馆还积极促进开展全民性读书活动。从1955年起，各地图书馆每年都在3月举办图书月活动。
    图书馆以举办书展、图书讲座、作家与读者见面等形式向读者推荐和介绍当代政治、经济和文学方面的书籍。许多图书馆还开展知识竞赛活动。（附图片）
