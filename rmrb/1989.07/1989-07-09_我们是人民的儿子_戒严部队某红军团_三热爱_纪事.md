50 years ago, Comrade Chen Yi wrote in a letter to a certain Red Army regiment: "We are the children of the people, the people are our parents, there is no reason for a son to be disobedient to his parents." 50 years later, this regiment, while executing the martial law mission in the capital, remembered the teachings of Comrade Chen, loved the capital, loved the people of the capital, and loved the young students. They wrote a moving chapter with their actions: "We will forever be the children of the people."

"Protect the People in Times of Danger"

On the evening of June 3, the regiment encountered obstacles from some uninformed civilians while advancing, and a few rioters took the opportunity to launch a frenzied attack. In an instant, stones, tiles, and beer bottles rained down. The regiment commander was hit, the political commissar was injured, and 80% of the officers and soldiers were successively struck. The soldiers gripped their rifles and picked up stones. If they retaliated, even the most ferocious rioters would not be a match. However, when they heard the political commissar shout, "In times of danger, we must still protect the people," the tightly clenched fists relaxed. They were willing to endure the humiliation themselves rather than injure the people. The political department director, along with the propaganda team, faced the flying stones and announced to the crowd: "Fellow countrymen, we are the children of the people's army. We are here to execute martial law to maintain order in the capital. Do not let the bad people mix among you. Whoever hits the PLA is our common enemy." Several civilians gathered around Deputy Regiment Commander Fang. A rioter took the opportunity to throw a large wooden stake without aiming. Seeing that the civilians were about to be hit, Deputy Regiment Commander Fang pushed them away with all his might. The stake hit his head, and the hard steel helmet was dented. Deputy Regiment Commander Fang was hit and fell to the ground, but the civilians were unharmed.

In the first two days after the regiment entered the city, a few rioters burned military vehicles, shot guns, and continued to engage in destructive activities. The civilians did not feel safe. To protect the safety of the civilians and let them sleep peacefully, the regiment organized night patrols. Many officers and soldiers, despite being injured and sick, insisted on standing guard. During the advance, Battalion Commander Luo Renhua was knocked unconscious by rioters and injured in multiple places. The regiment leaders ordered him to rest and recuperate, but he said, "Our mission is to protect the people. Now the safety of the people is threatened, how can I rest?" He insisted on leading the troops on night patrols and captured 18 rioters, ensuring that no destructive activities by rioters occurred in the areas under their responsibility.

"The More Difficult, the More We Must Uphold the People's Interests"

After the regiment entered the city, they faced many difficulties in their lives, but the officers and soldiers expressed, "The more difficult, the more we must uphold the people's interests and ensure that not a single hair of the people's interests is harmed." The regiment's camp was adjacent to an orchard of peaches and apples. The shade and the fragrance of the fruits were very tempting to the soldiers who were exposed to the scorching sun and lacked water. To ensure that not a single fruit of the people was lost, the regiment made a rule that no one was allowed to enter the orchard, and sentries were posted around the orchard. The regiment, battalion, and company levels also established people's discipline inspection teams to regularly check the implementation of people's discipline and correct any issues promptly. Once, a truck accidentally broke a peach branch while passing through. The regiment immediately ordered that all vehicles must take a detour in the future, and the regiment leaders also apologized to the orchard managers.

The third battalion of the regiment temporarily stayed at the Chongwenmen Hotel while executing their mission. To avoid affecting business and uphold the hotel's interests, they declined the hotel's offer of guest rooms and squeezed into the dining hall. The officers and soldiers voluntarily followed the hotel's management regulations, protected the hotel's facilities, did not take the elevator, rolled up the carpets, and each company established a service team to help the hotel clean. In just 12 days, the officers and soldiers formed a deep bond with the hotel staff. When the regiment moved, the hotel staff eagerly took photos with the soldiers, some shed tears, and some emotionally sang, "We meet and part again." "No Matter How Tired, We Must Do Something for the People"

Starting from June 4, the regiment slept outdoors in single clothes for four consecutive days and nights without a hot meal. On the fifth day, just as they had a place to settle down, they started the task of restoring the city's order. Some workers of the Beijing Municipal Street Light Management Office lived in the suburbs and could not go to work for those few days due to traffic disruptions. The second battalion of the regiment learned about this and immediately dispatched 100 officers and soldiers to replace them. They worked from early morning to late night for three consecutive days, assisting the workers in repairing the street lights damaged by rioters across the city and cleaning all the street lights on Chang'an Street and Tiananmen Square. The leader of the Street Light Management Office said with concern, "You are too tired like this." The soldiers replied, "No matter how tired, we must do something for the people."

The overpass at Chongwenmen is where Martyr Cui Guozheng sacrificed his life. During this period, people came to lay wreaths and condolences, and to pay their respects from morning to night. One could always see an officer leading two soldiers maintaining order and assisting the elderly and children. They were the "Learn from Yang Renshi" small group from the Howitzer Second Company. There were more than 20 such "Learn from Yang Renshi" small groups in the regiment, enthusiastically serving the people of the capital.

One evening, a middle-aged woman from Jilin got off the train but couldn't find a hotel and was afraid of encountering bad people. She paced anxiously by the sentry. The "Yang Renshi Company" Learn from Lei Feng small group asked about the situation and escorted her for more than two stations to find a hotel. Later, the woman wrote a letter of thanks, saying, "When I met the PLA, I felt at ease."

    “我们是人民的儿子”
    ——戒严部队某红军团“三热爱”纪事
    章立品　柯明
    50年前，陈毅同志在给某红军团的一封信中写道：“我们是人民的儿子，人民是我们的父母，天下没有儿子不孝顺父母的道理。”50年后，该团在执行首都戒严任务中，牢记陈老总的教诲，热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生，用行动谱写了“我们永远是人民的儿子”的动人篇章。
    “危急中仍要保护群众”
    6月3日晚，该团在开进中遭到一些不明真相的群众的阻拦，少数暴徒借机疯狂袭击。一时间，石头、瓦块、啤酒瓶雨点般飞来。团长被打了，政委受伤了，80％的干部战士相继挨砸。战士们攥紧了枪杆，捡起了石块，只要还手，再凶狂的暴徒也绝不是对手。但是当听到政委高喊“危急中仍要保护群众”，一双双紧攥的手又松开了，宁愿自己受委屈，也不误伤群众。政治处顾主任带着宣传组迎着飞石向群众宣布：“父老乡亲们，我们是人民子弟兵，进京执行戒严任务是为了维护首都秩序，不要让坏人混在你们中间。谁打解放军，谁就是我们共同的敌人。”几名群众围在方副团长旁边，一名暴徒趁乱将一根粗大的木桩没头没脑扔过来。方副团长见群众就要挨砸，猛一用劲把他们推开，木桩砸到自己头上，坚硬的钢盔竟凹进去一个坑。方副团长被砸得站不稳脚摔倒在地，几名群众却丝毫没有受伤。
    部队刚驻市区那两天，少数暴徒烧军车，打黑枪，仍在猖狂地进行破坏活动，群众没有安全感。为了保卫群众的安全，让他们能睡稳觉，该团组织夜间巡逻，许多干部战士都是带伤带病坚持执勤。一营营长罗仁华在开进途中曾被暴徒打昏，身上多处受伤，团首长要他休息养伤，他说：“我们的任务就是保护群众，现在群众的安全面临威胁，我怎么能休息呢？”他坚持晚上带领部队巡逻，先后抓获了十八名暴徒，保证了所负责的地段没有一起暴徒的破坏活动得逞。
    “越困难越要维护群众利益”
    该团进驻市区后，生活上一时遇到许多困难，干部战士表示“越困难越要维护群众利益，做到对群众利益秋毫无犯”。部队驻地紧挨着一片桃林苹果林，林间的荫凉，水果的浓香，对置身烈日暴晒、水源缺乏中的战士是多么的诱人。为了保证群众的果子一个不丢，该团作出了任何人不准进入果园一步的规定，并在果园四周派了岗哨。团营连各级还成立了群众纪律检查小组，经常检查执行群众纪律情况，发现问题及时纠正。有一次卡车通行时不慎挂断了一根桃树枝，团里马上要求今后车辆进出一律绕道，团领导还找到管理果园的同志赔礼道歉。
    该团三营因执行任务曾暂住崇文门饭店，为了不影响营业，维护饭店的利益，他们谢绝了饭店让出的客房，全营挤住在餐厅里。干部战士自觉遵守饭店的有关管理规定，爱护饭店的设施，上下楼不乘电梯，卷起地毯，各连还成立了服务组，帮助饭店打扫卫生。短短12天，干部战士同饭店工作人员结下了深厚的情谊。部队转移时，饭店工作人员纷纷拉着战士们合影留念，有的流下了眼泪，有的动情地唱起了“我们相见又分手”。“再累也要为群众做点事情”
    该团自6月4日起，连续4天4夜单衣露宿，没吃上一顿热饭，第5天刚有安顿的地方，征尘未洗，又开始了重整市容的劳动。北京市路灯管理处部分工人住在郊区，那几天因交通不畅无法上班。该团二营得知后，立即抽调100名干部战士顶上去，每天早起干到深夜，一连干了3天，协助工人修复了全市被暴徒破坏的路灯，并把十里长安街和天安门广场所有的路灯逐一擦拭干净。路灯管理处领导心痛地说：“你们这样太累了。”战士回答：“再累也要为群众做点事情。”
    崇文门过街天桥是崔国政烈士牺牲的地方，这段时间，到这里送花圈挽联、凭吊致哀的群众络绎不绝。从早到晚，人们都能看到一名军官带着两名战士在这里维持秩序，扶老携幼。他们是榴炮二连的学雷锋小组。像这样的学雷锋小组，该团共有二十多个，热忱地为首都群众服务。
    一天傍晚，一位来自吉林的中年妇女下车后没找到旅馆，又怕遇上坏人，焦急地在哨兵旁边徘徊。“杨根思连”学雷锋小组问明情况后，护送她走了两站多路，找到了一家旅馆。后来，这位妇女写来感谢信，信中说：“遇到解放军，我心里就踏实了。”
