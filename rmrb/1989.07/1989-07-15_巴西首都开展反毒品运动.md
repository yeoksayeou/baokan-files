Brazil's capital, Brasília, is currently conducting a 20-day anti-drug campaign.

The anti-drug campaign in Brazil's capital is organized by the National Anti-Drug Commission under the Ministry of Justice, with support from numerous private enterprises. During the 20-day propaganda activities, relevant departments have printed 25 million pamphlets, using written lectures to educate citizens on drug prevention and rehabilitation knowledge. They also published cases of how some young people unknowingly started using drugs and gradually became addicted, leading to criminal behavior, warning people to take heed. In recent days, the Federal District Anti-Drug Commission has set up numerous propaganda points and exhibition stalls in commercial districts, where anti-drug personnel use real objects to introduce the types of drugs and their harmful effects on the human body, helping ordinary residents to increase their knowledge of identifying and distinguishing drugs. Yesterday, tens of thousands of citizens and young students held a large rally in the city center square, carrying placards to oppose drug trafficking and drug use.

Drug proliferation has become a major social problem in Brazil. However, in recent years, the sale of drugs within Brazil has increased exponentially. In major cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, the police frequently uncover newly established drug processing plants and trading venues. The number of drug users nationwide has reached nearly 10 million.

    巴西首都开展反毒品运动
    本报巴西利亚7月14日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西首都巴西利亚目前正在开展一场为期20天的反毒品运动。
    巴西首都的这场反毒品运动是由司法部下属的禁毒品委员会组织的，并得到许多私营企业单位的赞助。在20天的宣传活动中，有关部门印发了2500万份小册子，通过书面讲座的方式向市民介绍防毒戒毒的知识，并选登了一些青少年如何从不自觉的吸毒逐步变成吸毒成瘾和走上犯罪道路的事实，要求人们引以为戒。连日来，首都联邦区禁毒委员会还在商业闹市区设立了不少宣传点和展览摊，由禁毒人员通过实物介绍毒品的种类和对人体的危害性能，使一般居民增加识别和鉴别毒品的知识。昨天，成千上万的市民和青少年学生举着标语牌在首都市中心广场举行反对贩毒和吸毒的大型集会。
    毒品泛滥已成为巴西的一大社会公害。但近几年来在巴西境内的毒品销售量成倍增加，在圣保罗和里约热内卢等大城市，警方还不断地破获新设的毒品加工厂和交易所，全国吸毒的人数达近千万人。
