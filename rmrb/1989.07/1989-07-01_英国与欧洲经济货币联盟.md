The recently concluded 41st European Community summit in Madrid unexpectedly reached a compromise agreement on the issue of the Economic and Monetary Union, with public opinion noting that "the EC is beginning to move towards an Economic and Monetary Union," marking "a historic turning point."

The progress made at this summit on economic and monetary integration is largely due to the change in Britain's stance. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in her speech, expressed support for the first phase of the Delors Plan, which involves greater cooperation in monetary policy, the abolition of exchange controls, and the removal of barriers in financial services. However, Britain has reservations, opposing the second and third phases of the plan, which involve establishing a European Central Bank and issuing a unified currency, as it believes this would infringe on national sovereignty.

Compared to Britain's previous stance on this issue, observers believe that Mrs. Thatcher has "changed her tune" and taken a "substantive step" towards European integration. This agreement means that the British Prime Minister, for the first time at an EC summit, confirmed that the pound would join the European Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism. It should be noted that Britain did not unconditionally accept the first phase of the "Delors Report," but did so under two conditions. First, Britain's inflation rate must significantly decrease, and the European single market must be formed. Second, the capital and financial markets of other member states must be fully liberalized. Therefore, some local newspapers believe that Mrs. Thatcher, while making concessions, has also "bought time" to defend her position.

Despite Britain's progress towards the EC's Economic and Monetary Union at this summit, disagreements remain, and the debate is far from over. According to local analysts, the joint communiqué did not explicitly endorse the key points in the "Delors Report," namely that the previous stage of the Economic and Monetary Union can "automatically" transition to the next stage.

Mrs. Thatcher emphasized that there is no such thing as "automatically" moving from one stage to another. Moreover, there are differing views on the authority of the "Delors Report," that is, whether it is the sole basis for moving towards an Economic and Monetary Union. Mrs. Thatcher said at a press conference that the "Delors Report" is a good basis, but not the only basis. Additionally, some countries advocate setting 1992 as the deadline for entering the Economic and Monetary Union, to which Britain also objects.

What is the future of Britain's relationship with the European Economic and Monetary Union? The Financial Times analysis suggests that the pound may still remain outside the European Monetary System before the next British general election. The Madrid summit has greased the wheels for the EC's move towards an Economic and Monetary Union and provided momentum for Britain to join the European Economic and Monetary Union, but it has not completely overcome the current disagreements. It seems that Britain's process of joining the European Monetary Union may still be relatively slow.

### 英国与欧洲经济货币联盟

    英国与欧洲经济货币联盟
    本报记者　陈特安
    刚刚闭幕的第41届欧洲共同体马德里首脑会议出人意料地在经济和货币联盟问题上达成妥协性协议，舆论认为，“欧共体开始走上经济和货币联盟之路”，这是“一个历史转折点”。
    此次首脑会议能在经济和货币一体化方面取得进展，英国立场的改变是一个重要原因。英国首相撒切尔夫人在发言中表明了英国支持德洛尔计划的第一阶段的设想，即支持在货币政策方面进行较大程度的合作，取消汇率控制和消除金融业务方面的壁垒，当然，英国是有保留的，它反对该计划的第二和第三阶段的设想，即建立欧洲中央银行和发行统一货币，它认为这将使各国主权受到侵害。
    同英国过去在这一问题上的立场相比，观察家们认为，玛·撒切尔首相已经“改变调子”，在朝欧洲一体化的道路上“走出了有实质意义的一步”。因为这个协议意味着英国首相第一次在欧共体首脑会议上确认：英镑将加入欧洲货币体系的汇率机制。应该看到，英国并非无条件地接受“德洛尔报告”第一阶段的设想，而是以两个条件为前提的。一是英国通货膨胀率大幅度下降，欧洲统一大市场已经形成；二是其它成员国的资本和金融市场已经完全放宽限制。因此，此间一些报刊认为，撒切尔夫人在作出妥协的同时也为捍卫自己立场“赢得了时间”。
    尽管英国在本届首脑会议上向欧共体经济和货币联盟迈进了一步，但分歧依存，争论尚未完结。据此间分析家分析，联合公报并未明确认可“德洛尔报告”中的关键性论点，即经济货币联盟的前一个阶段可以“自动”转入下一个阶段。
    撒切尔夫人强调说，绝对没有所谓由一个阶段“自动”进入另一个阶段之说。同时，各国对于“德洛尔报告”的权威性，即它是不是导向经济和货币联盟的唯一基础上，也有不同看法。撒切尔夫人在记者招待会上说，“德洛尔报告”是一个好的基础，但不是唯一的基础。此外，有的国家主张把1992年确定为进入经济和货币联盟的最后期限，英国对这个期限也持异议。
    英国与欧洲经济货币联盟关系的前景如何？《金融时报》的分析是，在英国下一届大选之前，英镑仍可能在欧洲货币体系之外。马德里首脑会议为欧共体走向经济和货币联盟的车轮涂上了润滑剂，也为英国加入欧洲经济和货币联盟提供了推动力，但它仍未能完全突破目前的分歧。看来，英国加入欧洲货币联盟的进程仍可能比较缓慢。
