    Police in São Paulo Bust Counterfeit Dollar Ring

    According to local newspapers, five Brazilians with ties to Colombian drug traffickers were recently apprehended by Brazilian and American law enforcement while staying at a hotel in São Paulo with over 200,000 counterfeit U.S. dollars.

    The large quantity of fake U.S. dollars was printed in the city of Letícia, located at the southern tip of Colombia near the Brazilian border, and then distributed through various channels into the market. U.S. anti-drug agents had been tracking the counterfeit money ring for nearly a month and, after gathering sufficient information, coordinated with Brazilian police to make the arrests. According to the police, the 200,000 counterfeit dollars were merely samples, and another batch of 1 million counterfeit dollars was about to be delivered. U.S. authorities suspect that an additional 1 million in counterfeit currency has already entered the drug market in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

    The seized counterfeit bills were all $100 denominations, all with identical serial numbers. The counterfeit money ring primarily targeted gold mining areas, exchanging the fake dollars for gold, which was then used to purchase drugs. It is reported that the police have obtained sufficient leads, and the counterfeit money dispersed by this international drug and counterfeit money ring could amount to as much as $100 million. Currently, the police are investigating the whereabouts of this counterfeit money ring.

    圣保罗破获假美钞集团
    本报巴西利亚电　据当地报纸报道，5名与哥伦比亚毒品贩子有勾连的巴西人，前不久携带20余万假美钞投宿圣保罗市一家旅馆时，被巴西和美国警方联手擒获。
    这批数目庞大的假美元，是在哥伦比亚南端与巴西交界的城市累提西亚印制的，然后通过各种渠道流入市场。美国扫毒人员跟踪该伪钞集团将近一个月之久，掌握了其行踪以后会同巴西警方下手逮捕。据警方指出，这20多万假美元只是样品，另有一笔100万的伪钞即将运到，美国警方推测，还有100万美元伪币已流入巴西里约热内卢毒品市场。
    被缉获的伪币，面额均为100美元，号码全部相同，伪钞集团主要以淘金地区为目标，向淘金者换取黄金，再用黄金换取毒品。据说警方已获得充分线索，该国际性毒品及伪钞集团所散发出去的伪币可能高达1000万美元，目前警方正在详查这批伪钞集团的行踪。
