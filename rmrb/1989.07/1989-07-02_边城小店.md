In the beautiful border town of Horgos, the most bustling place is this unassuming sister shop. Almost all foreigners passing through the border and tourists coming to visit will stop by this shop to chat with the young and beautiful girls, have a drink, or buy some souvenirs.

When I arrived, it was the peak of summer, with scorching heat. A few blond, blue-eyed Soviet people had just driven their large trucks into the border crossing and quickly jumped down, heading straight for the small shop.

From a distance, a girl in a floral dress greeted them like a flower, speaking fluent Russian: "Gentlemen, you must be tired. Have a bottle of chilled soda to cool off."

"Very good! Very good!" The Soviet people, as if at home, picked up bottles of soda with mist coming out and drank them down. These people were too tired from their long journey, so they also ordered chilled champagne, downing a bottle each in one gulp.

At this moment, I saw the girl had already brought over a basin of water with a white towel inside, presumably for the customers to wash their faces and hands after drinking.

The girl is only 18 years old. After graduating from high school, she didn't get into college, so she opened this individual small shop with her sister. Because her sister had good service, was diligent, and spoke Russian, she was quickly recruited by the Yili Light Industry Bureau's department store to be an accountant. Now, the sister shop is run by just one person. However, her 12-year-old younger sister often comes to help. Therefore, the name "sister shop" has not changed.

The shop receives mostly Soviet people every day, either drivers or relatives visiting from across the border. Therefore, she must learn Russian like her sister to adapt to her work.

There are Russian translators at the Horgos border station, so she took them as her teachers, studying diligently and taking notes. She recorded all her teachers' lessons and played them over and over again when she had time. Through continuous interaction and conversation with Soviet people, her Russian improved rapidly.

These Soviet people love small commodities and handicrafts the most, especially knitted outfits for children, which they buy by the box. Xiao Zhang treats every customer with courtesy and patience. If she doesn't have what the customer wants, she will take notes and promise to get it for them next time. While greeting the "customers," she uses a small stool to reach the high shelves, taking down the pre-packaged small packages, counting the items in front of the customers, and smiling as she hands over packages of curling irons, women's sandals, and small electrical appliances, greeting them like old friends: "This is the fashionable shirt you wanted." "This is what I had someone bring from Shenzhen especially for you." The customers, receiving their satisfactory items, keep saying, "Thank you! Thank you!" The young girl said that although she runs an individual shop, it is still a window for international exchange. The quality of service directly affects a country's dignity and honor. She wants to use her actions to show the friendly and kind national sentiment of the Chinese people. To relieve the summer heat, she specially bought an electric refrigerator to chill soda, beer, and watermelon for passing customers, not charging a single extra penny. To beat the heat, she prepares several thermoses of hot water every day for everyone to drink. When winter comes, she installs a large stove in the small 24-square-meter room, placing a few benches around it. The roaring fire makes the customers feel warm like spring as soon as they enter the house...

Just as we were talking, suddenly a Soviet person rushed in holding a bouquet of fresh flowers. He handed the flowers to the girl and said, "Please give this bouquet of fresh flowers to your younger sister. I am so grateful to her." He quickly took out ten yuan from his pocket and said, "This is the money I owed for the clothes last time. Please take it."

It turned out that this Soviet person was a truck driver responsible for transporting imported and exported goods between the two countries, usually coming every six or seven days. Because he often comes to the shop, they are already familiar with each other. That day, it happened to be her younger sister's turn to watch the shop. This driver bought a lot of clothes and handicrafts, but he didn't have enough money. Although the younger sister was young, she was very generous. She told the Soviet driver to take the goods first and bring the money next time, which moved the driver to thank her repeatedly, saying that Chinese people are truly friends, even the children are so pure and honest.

I don't understand Russian, but from the girl's lively conversation with the driver, I could feel a sense of mutual trust and gratitude blending together. Ah, people's kindness is reciprocal. May that bouquet of flowers forever bloom in the hearts of the people of the two countries...

    边城小店
    刘芳
    在美丽的边城霍尔果斯，最繁华的去处就属这座其貌不扬的姐妹小店了。因为那些通过口岸的几乎所有外国人和前来观光的游客，都要到这座小店里同年轻漂亮的小姐聊聊天，喝杯水，或买些纪念品。
    我去的时候正赶上热浪灼人的暑期。几位黄头发、蓝眼睛的苏联人刚把大卡车开进关口，便迅速跳下车，径直向小站奔去。
    远远地，见一位穿着朱丽纹连衣裙的少女，像花朵般地迎了上来，用流利的俄语说道：“先生辛苦了，先喝瓶冰镇汽水落落汗吧。”
    “很好！很好！”几位苏联人像在家里那样拿起一瓶瓶喷着白雾的汽水，咕嘟咕嘟地喝了起来。这些人长途跋涉得太累了，光喝汽水哪能解决问题，于是又要来了冰镇的香槟酒，一扬脖就是一瓶。
    这时，我见姑娘早已端来一盆清水，里边放有一条雪白的毛巾，想必是等客人喝完酒好洗脸擦手。
    姑娘今年才18岁，高中毕业后没考上大学，才在这里与姐姐一起开了家个体小商店。因姐姐服务态度好，办事勤快，又会俄语，很快被伊犁的二轻局商场招去当了会计，如今这姐妹店就只剩一人了。不过，她的12岁的小妹妹常来帮助她。因此，这姐妹店的称号一直没改。
    小店每天接待的大都是苏联人，不是司机就是过境的探亲人员，所以她必须像姐姐那样学会俄语，才能适应自己的工作。
    霍尔果斯边防站有俄语翻译，她就拜他们为师，刻苦地学习，用心地记。她把老师讲的课都录了音，没事时就一遍一遍地放。经过不断地与苏联人接触、会话，她的俄语水平提高很快。
    这些苏联人最喜欢的是小百货和手工艺品，尤其是小孩穿的针织套服，都是成箱地买。小张对每位顾客都是彬彬有礼，百问不烦。如果没有所要的商品，她就主动用笔记下来，答应他们下次来时一定给买上。她一边向“顾客”打着招呼，一边用小凳垫着脚登上老高老高的货架，把早已包装好的一个个小纸包取了下来，当着客人的面点清商品，笑眯眯地拿起一包包烫发器、女凉鞋、小电器，像招呼老朋友那样说：
    “这是您要的新潮衫。”“这是我托人从深圳特意给您买进来的。”客人接过自己满意的商品，不住声地说着：“谢谢！谢谢！”小姑娘说，虽然她开的是个体商店，但同样是国际间交流的一个窗口，服务态度的好坏，直接影响一个国家的尊严和荣誉。她要用自己的实际行动，去体现中国人友好善良的民族感情。为了消除夏天的暑热，她特意买了一台电冰箱，专为过往的客人冰镇汽水、啤酒和西瓜等，一分钱也不多收。为了去暑，她每天都要准备几壶开水，供大伙喝。严冬到来时，她就在这仅有的24平方米的小屋里安一个大火炉，周围放上几条板凳，炉火熊熊，客人们一进屋，就会感到春天般的温暖……
    正交谈时，忽有一位苏联人高举着一束鲜花匆匆地走了进来。他把花递给姑娘说：“请你把这束鲜花送给你的小妹妹吧，我太感谢她了。”说完，他迅速地从衣兜里掏出十元人民币，又说：“这是我上次买衣服欠下的钱，请收下。”
    原来这位苏联人是个汽车司机，负责运输双方的进出口物资，一般是六七天来一趟。因为常来小店，彼此已经熟悉。那天正赶上她的小妹妹看门，这位司机买了很多衣服和工艺品，结果钱不够了。小妹妹虽然年岁小，但却非常慷慨大方。她叫那位苏联司机先把商品拿走，下次来时再把钱捎来，感动得那位司机连连道谢，说中国人真够朋友，连小孩都非常纯朴憨厚。
    我不懂俄语，但从姑娘与那位司机的热烈交谈中，已经感受到有一种彼此信任和感激的心情正在交融。呵，人的爱心是互通的，愿那束鲜花永远开在两国人民心中……
