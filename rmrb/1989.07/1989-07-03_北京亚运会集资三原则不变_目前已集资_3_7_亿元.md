Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd.

The principles of fundraising for the 11th Asian Games remain unchanged. Currently, 370 million yuan has been raised.

The director of the fundraising department of the 11th Asian Games Organizing Committee, Wang Zhiliang, stated in an interview with Xinhua News Agency that "all fundraising income will first be used to ensure the needs of the Asian Games projects, and then, according to the progress of the Asian Games preparations, a portion will be used to offset some of the operational costs."

He said that by the end of June this year, 370 million yuan has been raised. Every penny of the fundraising income is strictly managed in terms of reception and management, and even more strictly in terms of usage.

After introducing a series of regulations and systems established by the fundraising department to properly manage and use the fundraising income, Wang Zhiliang said, "Please rest assured, domestic and overseas friends who care about the Asian Games, we will not spend a single penny of the fundraising income recklessly. Because we deeply understand that this money contains the patriotic feelings of compatriots at home and abroad, and the concern and trust of Asian and world peoples for the Asian Games and China."

When talking about future fundraising work, Wang Zhiliang said, "The Chinese government has announced that the policy of reform and opening up will not change, and the Organizing Committee has solemnly announced that the 11th Asian Games will be held as scheduled. I would also like to announce the 'three unchanging' principles of fundraising work here: the methods, policies, and goals of fundraising will not change; already signed agreements and contracts will not change; and the principles of mutual benefit, equality, and sincere cooperation will not change."

    目前已集资3.7亿元
    新华社北京7月3日电　（记者李莉）第十一届亚运会组委会集资部长王志良在同新华社记者谈到使用集资收入的原则时说，“所有集资收入首先保证亚运会工程的需要，然后，按照亚运会筹办工作的进度，贴补一部分开办费”。
    他说，到今年6月底，已集资3.7亿元人民币。每一笔集资收入在接收和管理上都是严格的，在使用上则更严格。
    王志良在介绍了集资部为管好、用好集资收入所制定的一系列规章制度后说，“请海内外各界关心亚运会的朋友们放心，我们绝不会乱花集资的一分钱。因为我们深知这些钱包含着海内外同胞的爱国之情和亚洲以及世界各国人民对亚运会的关心、对中国的信任。”
    在谈到今后的集资工作时，王志良说，中国政府已经宣布改革开放政策绝不改变，组委会也已郑重宣布第十一届亚运会如期召开不变，我在这里也想宣布集资工作的“三不变”原则，即集资方法、政策、目标不变；已签订的协议、合同不变；互惠互利、平等协商、真诚合作的原则不变。
