After the 1980-1982 crisis, the U.S. economy has entered its seventh year of expansion. Although the current economic growth rate remains relatively high, the U.S. financial system is quite fragile and faces numerous difficulties.

Institutions Collapsing En Masse

Since 1982, the U.S. has experienced a wave of bank collapses. In 1984, 79 banks collapsed, setting a historical high. Since then, the number of collapsing banks has continued to rise, with 120, 138, 148, and 200 banks collapsing in 1985, 1986, 1987, and 1988 respectively. Additionally, by the end of 1988, 1,416 banks across the country were listed as "problem banks" by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, accounting for approximately 10% of the total number of banks (over 14,000) it insures.

The situation in the U.S. savings and loan industry is even worse. From 1982 to 1988, the number of savings and loan institutions that went bankrupt due to insolvency rose sharply. According to U.S. publications, people have begun to lose confidence in the U.S. savings and loan industry, and since the second half of last year, there has been a phenomenon of "silent bank runs." From November 1988 to February 1989, depositors withdrew a total of $34 billion from savings and loan institutions. It was precisely in response to this severe situation that President Bush proposed an "important plan" to rescue the U.S. savings and loan industry.

Weak Deposit Insurance System

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation are two key pillars maintaining the stability of the U.S. financial system. These two companies primarily rely on insurance premiums collected from insured banks and savings and loan institutions, as well as various investment incomes, to sustain themselves. Since 1982, due to the increasing number of bank and savings and loan institution collapses each year, the companies have had to pay out more and more compensation, leading to a financial crisis of insufficient funds. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has been in the red for three consecutive years, with a combined deficit of $14 billion in the previous two years alone. The situation at the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation is even more dire, as its insurance fund has long been depleted, with a deficit of $13.7 billion in 1987 and an even larger deficit in 1988. Currently, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation has virtually no cash to pay compensation. In response, the Bush administration proposed a plan requiring commercial banks and savings and loan institutions to increase their premium payments to the two insurance companies to fill the insurance fund gap. Currently, the two companies are responsible for insuring deposits totaling $3.4 trillion for over 14,000 banks and 3,100 savings and loan institutions. It is estimated that by raising the insurance premium rate, the two companies can increase their insurance premium income by $1.6 billion and $1.2 billion respectively. However, this plan will undoubtedly add to the woes of the U.S. banking and savings and loan industries, causing dissatisfaction among bankers and savings and loan institutions. Even if the plan is implemented, it will only be a drop in the bucket and will not solve the financial difficulties of the two insurance companies. The Bush administration has also proposed establishing a special agency to sell $50 billion in government bonds to assist troubled savings and loan institutions, with the government paying the interest on the bonds. This indicates that without federal government support, the U.S. federal deposit insurance system will be difficult to maintain.

Foreign Banks Encroaching on Territory

The large-scale infiltration of foreign financial capital into the U.S. banking industry began in the mid-1980s. According to U.S. reports, an increasing number of U.S. companies believe that foreign banks not only have strong financial strength but also offer lower loan interest rates than U.S. banks. Therefore, these U.S. companies are more willing to establish business relationships with foreign banks.

Japanese financial capital has been the most aggressive in its assault on the U.S. banking industry and has seized the most territory. By the end of June 1988, Japan had 33 banks operating 116 branches in the U.S. The assets, deposits, and loans of these banking institutions accounted for 51.5%, 48.9%, and 50.6% of the total for all foreign banks in the U.S., respectively. The U.S. West Coast state of California is a key target for Japanese banks. According to reports, Japanese banks already hold 24% of all bank assets and 25% of all loans in California, and five of the top 10 banks in the state are Japanese. Japanese financial capital is now expanding into the U.S. Midwest and South. The four major Western European countries of Britain, France, West Germany, and Italy have more bank branches in the U.S. than Japan, but their assets, deposits, and loan amounts account for less than 1/5 of the total for all foreign banks. In recent years, U.S. banks have begun to scale back their international operations and expand their domestic operations to strengthen the competitiveness of the domestic banking industry. It appears that the competition for U.S. banking territory among international financial capital will intensify.

Pressure from Third World Debt

Since the "debt crisis" in the Third World erupted in 1982, some of the largest multinational banks in the U.S. have been trying to reduce the burden of Third World debt, but with little effect. By the end of June 1987, developing countries in the Third World owed 25 of the largest U.S. bank holding companies $73 billion. By the end of June 1988, Citibank, Chase, Bank of America, J.P. Morgan, Chemical, Security Pacific, Manufacturers Hanover, First Interstate, Bankers Trust, and Wells Fargo, the 10 largest multinational banks, still held $57.7 billion in debt from developing countries in the Third World, almost equal to the sum of their total equity and loan loss reserves.

On March 10, U.S. Treasury Secretary Brady proposed a new plan to address the international debt crisis, which was generally welcomed by the major Latin American debtors. The question now is whether the creditor banks will "voluntarily" forgive the debt? If the creditor banks agree to forgive the debt, how much should be forgiven? This is crucial for those U.S. multinational banks that hold the most Third World debt. According to the "American Banker," the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development suggested that the debt owed by Third World countries to banks be reduced by 30% across the board. According to this ratio, the aforementioned 10 largest U.S. multinational banks would write off $17.3 billion in debt, which is approximately $2.6 billion more than their current loan loss reserves, making it difficult to bear.

Recently, the Federal Reserve has begun to ease monetary policy, and commercial banks' prime rates have been lowered by 0.5 percentage points to 11%. The direct reason for the Fed's interest rate adjustment is to curb the rise of the dollar, while the deeper reason is to prevent problems in the financial system. However, lowering interest rates will add to inflationary pressures and hinder the inflow of foreign capital. Therefore, the Fed, in order to control inflation and attract foreign capital to make up for the fiscal deficit, cannot keep interest rates too low. From the trend of development, as long as the U.S. federal government's fiscal deficit does not come down, coupled with the further deterioration of inflation, the Fed will have to keep interest rates at a certain level, threatening the U.S. banking and savings and loan systems with a production slump and a decline in the securities industry.

    面临困境的美国金融体系
    王惠洪
    美国经济度过1980—1982年危机以后，已经进入第7个扩张年。尽管目前经济增长速度仍然较快，但是，美国的金融体系却相当脆弱，面临着重重困难。
    各机构纷纷倒闭
    美国从1982年开始形成一股银行倒闭浪潮，1984年倒闭了79家，创历史最高记录。此后，倒闭银行的数目有增无已，1985年至1988年分别为120、138、148和200家。另外，截至1988年底，全国有1416家银行经美国联邦存款保险公司审定列入“有问题”银行名单，占受其担保银行总数（14000多家）的大约10％。
    美国储蓄贷款业的境况更加糟糕。从1982年到1988年，因失去偿债能力而倒闭的储贷机构数目直线上升。据美刊报道，人们已开始对美国储贷业失去信心，去年下半年以来出现了“无声的挤兑”现象。从1988年11月到1989年2月存户从储贷机构总共提走340亿美元的存款。布什总统正是针对这种严峻形势而提出一项挽救美国储贷业的“重要方案”。
  存款保险系统虚弱
    美国联邦存款保险公司和联邦储蓄和贷款保险公司是保持美国金融体系稳定的两根重要支柱。这两家公司主要靠向承保的银行和储贷机构收取保险金和各项投资收入维持。自1982年以来，由于银行和储贷机构倒闭的数目一年高过一年，公司支付的赔偿费用越来越多，使公司财政陷入了入不敷出的窘境。美国联邦存款保险公司已经连续三年出现赤字，仅前年和去年两年合计亏损额就高达140亿美元。美国联邦储蓄和贷款保险公司的情况更加严重，它的保险基金早已用光，1987年赤字高达137亿美元，1988年的赤字还要更大一些。现在联邦储贷保险公司实际上已经没有现金支付赔偿费了。为此，布什政府提出计划要求商业银行和储贷机构向两家保险公司增加交纳存款保险金，以填补公司的保险基金窟窿。目前这两家公司负责为14000多家银行和3100多家储贷机构的3.4万亿美元存款保险。据估算，因调高保险金率，两家公司可分别增加保险金收入16亿美元和12亿美元。但是，这项计划无疑会给美国银行业和储贷业雪上加霜，引起银行界和储贷界的不满，即使计划能够付诸实施，也只是杯水车薪，解决不了两家保险公司的财政困难。布什政府还提出要成立专门机构，出售500亿美元的公债以资助陷入困境的储贷机构，公债利息由政府支付。这表明没有联邦政府的支持，美国联邦存款保险系统已经很难维持了。
    外资银行抢占地盘
    外国金融资本大量渗入美国银行业是在80年代中期以后。据美报报道，现在越来越多的美国公司认为，外资银行不仅实力强，而且提供贷款的利率比美国银行低，因此，这些美国公司反而更加愿意与外资银行建立业务联系。
    日本金融资本对美国银行业的攻势最猛，抢占的地盘也最大。迄1988年6月底，日本共有33家银行在美国开设了116个办事机构。这些银行机构的资产、存款和贷款分别占在美国的全部外资银行这三项总数的51.5％、48.9％和50.6％。美国西海岸的加利福尼亚州是日资银行的重点进攻地区。据报道，日资银行已经占有加州所有银行资产的24％和贷款的25％，加州最大的10家银行中就有5家是日本的。日本金融资本现正向美国中西部和南部伸展。英国、法国、西德和意大利等西欧4大国在美国开设的银行办事机构虽比日本多，但它们的资产、存款和贷款额占全部外资银行总额的百分比不及日本的1／5。近年来，美国银行开始收缩国际业务，扩充国内业务，加强国内银行业的竞争能力。看来，国际金融资本争夺美国银行阵地的斗争会日趋激烈。
  第三世界债务的压力
    自1982年第三世界“债务危机”爆发以来，美国的一些大型跨国银行一直在设法减轻第三世界债务的负担，但成效并不显著。迄1987年6月底，第三世界发展中国家积欠美国25家最大银行控股公司730亿美元债务。到1988年6月底，花旗、大通、美洲、摩根、化学、安全太平洋、制造商汉诺威、第一州际、银行家信托以及威尔士·法戈等10家最大的跨国银行还持有第三世界发展中国家债务577亿美元，几乎等于它们的全部股本与贷款损失准备金之和。
    3月10日，美国财政部长布雷迪提出了一项解决国际债务危机的新计划，拉美主要债务国对此普遍表示欢迎。现在的问题是债权银行是否“自愿”减免债务？如债权银行同意减免了，那么究竟减多少才算合适？这对美国那些持有第三世界债务最多的跨国银行是至关重要的。据《美国银行家报》报道，“联合国贸发会议”建议第三世界国家欠银行债务全面削减30％。按此比例计算，上述美国10家最大跨国银行将勾销173亿美元债务，比它们现有的贷款损失准备金约超出26亿美元，看来是很难承受的。
    最近美国联邦储备委员会开始放松银根，商业银行的优惠利率下调0.5个百分点，降至11％。美联储调整利率的直接原因是为了抑制美元涨势，深层原因在于防止金融体系出问题。但是，利率下调又会给通货膨胀增添上涨压力和使外资内流受阻，因此，美联储为了控制通货膨胀和吸引外资以弥补财政赤字，又不能把利率压得太低。从发展趋势看，只要美国联邦政府的财政赤字下不来，再加上通货膨胀如进一步恶化，美联储则不得不使利率保持一定高度，使美国的银行和储贷体系受到生产滑坡和证券业衰退的威胁。
