Party, government, military, and civilian leaders in Ningbo City, along with the broader populace, are working tirelessly day and night on the front lines of typhoon relief and disaster response. Their goal is to minimize the damage caused by Typhoon No. 9.

The typhoon made landfall in the southern part of Xiangshan County, Ningbo City, around 11 PM on July 20th and wreaked havoc along the coast for approximately 13 hours, resulting in severe damage.

Before the typhoon hit, the Ningbo Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government held an emergency meeting with representatives from various relevant departments at the municipal level. They established a typhoon response command leadership team and organized five typhoon response task forces to be deployed to the front lines.

Shortly after the typhoon made landfall, Ningbo Municipal Party Secretary Sun Jiaxian rushed to the disaster-stricken area of Shipu District in Xiangshan County to assess the damage. He worked with local officials to deploy and implement measures for typhoon relief, disaster response, and production recovery. The People's Liberation Army units stationed in Ningbo rushed to wherever they were needed for rescue efforts. When the typhoon struck the town of Hepu on Nantian Island in Shipu District, all communication was cut off. The naval units stationed in Shipu District provided significant assistance, quickly determining that a tsunami had occurred in the waters around Hepu, with water levels exceeding normal tide levels by more than a meter. They promptly took emergency measures.

    党政军民齐心  奋战救灾前沿
    宁波市全力抗台风
    据新华社宁波7月23日电　（记者郭说传）浙江省宁波市党、政、军干部与广大群众，全力以赴，日夜奋战在抗台风抢险救灾的前沿，努力把第9号台风造成的损失减少到最低限度。
    这次台风在7月20日23点左右在宁波市象山县南部登陆后，一直在沿海肆虐约13个小时，造成严重损失。
    在台风登陆之前，宁波市委、市政府紧急召开市级各有关方面负责人参加的会议，专门成立了防台风指挥领导班子，组织了5个抗台风工作组分赴抗台风前沿地带。
    宁波市委书记孙家贤在台风登陆后的数小时内，驱车赶到受灾的象山县石浦区察看灾情，同当地干部一起部署落实抗台风救灾、恢复生产的措施。人民解放军驻宁波部队，哪里抢险需要就奔赴哪里。当台风侵袭石浦区南田岛上的鹤浦镇时，通讯联系全部中断。驻石浦区的海军部队给予大力协助，很快了解到鹤浦一带海面曾发生海啸，潮位超过正常潮位一米以上，便及时采取了应急措施。
