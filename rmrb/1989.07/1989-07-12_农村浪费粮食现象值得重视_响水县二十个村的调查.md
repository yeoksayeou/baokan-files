Recently, we conducted a questionnaire survey in 20 villages across 10 townships in Xinghua County, Jiangsu. The results showed that grain waste in rural areas is quite common. One might wonder: do rural people not understand the saying "every grain of rice is the result of hard work"?

Based on our survey, we found that grain waste in rural areas mainly manifests in the following four areas:

	1. **Loss during harvest**: All 20 villages reported that the traditional practice of "harvesting carefully and collecting every grain" has faded. During the harvest season, scenes of people picking up scattered wheat and rice stalks in the fields are rare. Even the stalks dropped during transportation are often ignored. Losses at the threshing sites are also significant. According to one village's calculation, 7,375 kilograms of grain are lost each year during harvest, accounting for 0.52% of the village's total grain production, with an average loss of 25 kilograms per household.

	2. **Consumption during storage**: This mainly includes losses due to rats, insects, and mold. According to statistics from the 20 villages, rats consume 170,000 kilograms of grain annually, averaging 18 kilograms per household, which is a substantial amount. Many households lack proper storage conditions and knowledge, leading to frequent insect damage, especially to wheat. The 20 villages reported an annual loss of 48,000 kilograms of grain due to insect damage.

	3. **Loss during processing**: In the 20 villages we surveyed, over 60% of the processing machinery is outdated, leading to significant grain waste. According to statistics, the 20 villages have 49 flour milling machines with an average flour extraction rate of 71.9%, while state-owned flour mills achieve an extraction rate of over 73% for standard flour. There are 34 rice hulling machines with an average rice extraction rate of 67.5%, while state-owned processing plants achieve a rate of 68-70% for indica and japonica rice. It is estimated that this alone results in a loss of over 170,000 kilograms of grain.

	4. **Waste during use**: This mainly occurs in three ways: First, there is a lack of planning in grain usage, with many households cooking more than they eat, often throwing away leftover rice into pig feeders. The spirit of hard work and frugality has faded in the minds of some farmers. Second, feeding livestock with raw grain is quite common. According to the survey, in 1988, the 20 villages raised a total of 14,658 pigs (marketable) and 171,055 poultry, consuming 3.92 million kilograms of grain, which accounts for 18.6% of the total grain production of the 20 villages in the previous year. Third, waste among rural primary and middle school students is also significant. In recent years, due to a relaxation in education about hard work and thrift, many young people do not understand the value of food, leading to serious waste, especially among middle school students who often throw away leftover food in school.

    农村浪费粮食现象值得重视
    ——响水县二十个村的调查
    何素成　田大道
    最近，我们对江苏响水县10个乡镇中的20个村进行了问卷式调查。结果表明，农村浪费粮食的现象相当普遍。人们不免要问：难道乡下人也不知“粒粒皆辛苦”？
    我们综合调查情况，发现农村中的粮食浪费主要表现在以下四个方面：
    收获时的散失。20个村普遍反映，过去那种“精收细打、颗粒归仓”的观念逐渐淡薄了。收获季节，田野里拾麦穗、拾稻穗的景象不见了，就连搬运时掉在路上的一把把麦穗、稻穗也无人问津。场头上的损失也较多。据一个村测算，每年收获时散失的粮食就达7375公斤，占该村粮食产量的0.52％，户均损失粮食达25公斤。
    贮存时的消耗。主要是鼠耗、虫蛀和霉变。据20个村统计，每年鼠耗粮食达17万公斤，户均18公斤，数量惊人。还有不少农户由于贮粮条件有限，加之缺乏贮粮常识，粮食在贮存中时常发生虫蛀损失，尤其是小麦，在贮存中被虫蛀的较多，20个村年虫蛀损失粮食达4.8万公斤。
    加工时的损失。我们所调查的20个村，现有的加工机械有60％以上老化陈旧，加工浪费粮食现象较为严重。据统计，20个村拥有面粉加工机49台，出面率平均为71.9％，而国营面粉厂加工七五面粉的出面率则达到73％以上；拥有辗米机34台，出米率平均为67.5％，而国营加工厂加工籼、粳稻的出米率则达到68—70％。据推算仅此项，即损失粮食17万多公斤。
    使用中的浪费。主要表现在三方面：一、用粮无计划，煮多吃少的现象比较普遍，白花花的剩饭倒进了猪食缸的不是极个别。艰苦奋斗、过紧日子的思想在一些农民的头脑中淡薄了。二、用原粮喂养畜禽现象更为普遍。据调查统计，1988年20个村共饲养生猪（出栏数）14658头，家禽171055只，合计消耗粮食392万公斤，占20个村中去年粮食总产的18.6％。三、农村中、小学生的浪费也很惊人。近年来，由于放松了艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约的教育，不少青少年“不知盘中餐、粒粒皆辛苦”，生活中存在着严重的浪费现象，特别是农村的中学生，在校蒸多吃少，丢弃剩饭的现象经常发生，他们却毫不可惜。
