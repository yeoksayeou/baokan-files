Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 21st. — The reporter learned from today's Shenyang City Anti-Corruption and Strengthening Clean Government Conference that Shenyang City has proposed three strict measures to further strengthen the city's party discipline and clean government.

These three strict measures are:

	— For children and spouses of leading cadres at the county and department level and above in party and government organs who work in party and government organs or affiliated institutions within the personnel quota, they are not allowed to take unpaid leave to engage in commercial activities. For those found to be illegally buying and selling for profit by relying on family relationships and influence, they must be dealt with seriously according to law.

	— For the use of public funds to purchase commercial housing for leading cadres, it must be discussed and agreed upon by the leading collective (enterprises must also be discussed and passed by the workers' congress), and reported to the higher authorities for approval. After approval, when purchasing commercial housing, high-end housing above the standard is not allowed. Enterprise managers are not allowed to use public funds to purchase housing for themselves during the lease or contract period. Leading cadres at all levels are not allowed to use their power to occupy more housing. In housing allocation, it should start from the housing conditions of the unit, while strictly implementing the housing control standards for cadres at all levels, it is not appropriate to have too much difference with the workers. For those who violate the regulations to build, buy, or occupy more housing, different measures such as confiscating the housing, economic compensation, vacating the excess housing, and increasing the rent will be taken to correct it resolutely. For those with serious circumstances, party and administrative disciplinary actions should be taken.

	— For party and government cadres who go to the grassroots to perform official duties, they are not allowed to accept banquets and must implement separate meals and pay according to regulations. For those who violate the regulations, in addition to making up the difference, they will be criticized and even disciplined. For those who use business exchanges to have lavish banquets, the relevant personnel must be held accountable.
