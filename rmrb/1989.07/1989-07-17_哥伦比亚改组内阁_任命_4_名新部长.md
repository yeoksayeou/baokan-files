Colombia's President Barco yesterday appointed four new ministers, ending the cabinet crisis that began last weekend.

The newly appointed ministers are: Orlando Vasquez as the Minister of the Interior, General Oscar Borrero Restrepo as the Minister of Defense, Monica de Greiff as the Minister of Justice, and Margarita Mena as the Minister of Mines.

According to media analysis, Colombia's parliament will soon discuss constitutional amendments. New Interior Minister Vasquez is a member of the first committee of the House of Representatives responsible for constitutional affairs and a key supporter of President Barco's push for constitutional reform. His appointment will facilitate the parliament's passage of the constitutional amendment bill. The change in the Minister of Defense comes as some guerrilla groups are preparing to engage in dialogue with the government, while the replacement of the Minister of Mines may be related to another guerrilla group's condition to stop attacking oil facilities by removing the original minister.

    哥伦比亚改组内阁
    任命4名新部长
    本报加拉加斯7月17日电  记者朱满庭报道：哥伦比亚总统巴尔科昨天任命了4位新部长，结束了从上周末开始的内阁危机。
    新任命的部长是：内务部长奥尔兰多·巴斯克斯、国防部长奥斯卡·博德罗·雷斯特雷波将军、司法部长莫尼卡·德格雷夫和矿业部长玛加丽塔·梅纳。
    据报界分析，哥伦比亚议会几天后将讨论修改宪法问题，新内务部长巴斯克斯为众议院负责宪法事务的第一委员会的成员，是巴尔科总统力主修改宪法的重要支持者。他就任内阁职务，将有利于议会通过宪法修改草案，国防部长的更换则正值国内一些游击队准备与政府对话之际，而矿业部长换人可能与另一支游击队以撤换原部长为中止袭击石油设施的条件有关。
