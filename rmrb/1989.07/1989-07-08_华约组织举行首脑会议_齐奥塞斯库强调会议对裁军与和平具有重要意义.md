Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, July 7th.

A two-day summit of the Warsaw Pact member states opened this morning in Bucharest. The heads of state, party leaders, and military leaders of the seven member countries attended the meeting.

Today, Ceaușescu presided over the opening ceremony. In his opening remarks, he emphasized that the conference is of special importance in promoting the process of disarmament, peace, and cooperation in Europe and the world.

Subsequently, the leaders of the member states' parties and the commander-in-chief of the Warsaw Pact joint armed forces spoke at the meeting.

Comments from member states and foreign observers indicated that this meeting of the Warsaw Pact's highest political consultative committee would be different from previous ones and would become a "turning point" in the Eastern European alliance's foreign policy. One of the important agenda items is to partially reform the leadership structure of the Warsaw Pact. The Soviet *Izvestia* reported that the summit would discuss and decide on the establishment of a secretary-general position, similar to that of NATO, to be led by the secretary-general in the future. The meeting would "fully discuss" all important issues within the alliance, including the "difficult and complex reform process of socialist countries."

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, July 8th.

The two-day summit of the Warsaw Pact member states concluded this morning. The joint statement and communiqué adopted by the meeting will be released later.

According to a report from the Romanian News Agency, the leader of the delegation from the German Democratic Republic, Erich Honecker, the General Secretary of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, left early this morning due to an acute gallbladder condition. Honecker arrived in Bucharest on the afternoon of the 6th to participate in the Warsaw Pact Political Consultative Committee meeting.

    齐奥塞斯库强调会议对裁军与和平具有重要意义
    本报贝尔格莱德7月7日电　记者严正报道：为期2天的华约成员国首脑会议今天上午在布加勒斯特开幕。
    该组织的7个成员国党政军第一把手参加了会议。
    今天，齐奥塞斯库主持开幕式。他在开幕词中强调，会议对推动欧洲和世界裁军、和平与合作进程具有特别重要的意义。
    随后，各成员国党的领导人和华约联合武装力量总司令在会上发了言。
    各成员国和外国观察家的评论说，此次华约最高领导机构政治协商委员会的会议不同往常，将成为“东欧联盟对外政策的转折点”，其中一项重要议程是部分地改组华约的领导体制。苏《新闻报》说，首脑会议要讨论并确定设立秘书长一职，像北大西洋组织那样，今后由秘书长领导华约组织。会议将“充分讨论”联盟内部关系中所有重要问题，包括“社会主义国家艰难复杂的改革过程”。
    新华社布加勒斯特7月8日电　为期两天的华约成员国首脑会议今天上午在这里闭幕。会议通过的联合声明和公报将在晚些时候公布。
