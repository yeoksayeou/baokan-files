The Ministry of Culture held the "Revival of Peking Opera Exchange Performance" in Shenyang this May, marking the first major event in the history of Chinese Peking Opera since the founding of the People's Republic. Eighteen Peking Opera troupes and art schools from Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin performed 20 new and adapted plays. This exchange performance provided a comprehensive overview of the current state of Peking Opera in terms of script creation and talent cultivation. It also fully demonstrated the enthusiasm and dedication of Peking Opera artists towards the development of the art form, as well as their efforts and explorations in advancing Peking Opera.

The exchange performance selected seven outstanding plays, including "The Windy Widow," "Willows by the Village," "The Soul of the Khitan," and "The River of Love." Overall, these outstanding plays gave the impression that Peking Opera is currently striving to reach a higher artistic level, both in content and form. I would like to emphasize the following two points.

First, the exploration of artistic content rooted in regional culture has expanded the artistic scope and depth of Peking Opera for the audience. Regional opera often reflects the crystallization of various cultural elements unique to a region. Conversely, regional opera has an inherent advantage in portraying regional culture and the customs and habits of local life. Peking Opera is primarily popular in North China and Northeast China, and it is the history and present-day life of these regions that form the main theme of most plays in this exchange performance. It is also the historical and cultural background of these regions that shape the current cultural atmosphere of Peking Opera. The tragedies and comedies of the Yan and Zhao lands, the past and present of the Songliao Plain, the history and reality between the White Mountains and Black Rivers... all contribute to a vibrant map of the current artistic content of Peking Opera. Importantly, many plays, when depicting local life and regional culture, have broken away from the superficial artistic depth of merely showcasing local customs and habits. Instead, they artistically examine and appreciate these aspects under the broad cultural context of history and the present, with a clear modern consciousness. This has unearthed deeply profound artistic connotations. For example, "Willows by the Village" uses the interplay of historical and contemporary times to capture the tragic love stories of generations of kind-hearted people, caused by the entanglement of feudal ethical concepts with economic, political, and other factors. It does not merely stop at politically criticizing or morally denying these feudal ethical concepts. Instead, it delves into the cultural levels and cultural psychology to observe and reflect. Through the emotionally tragic lives of ordinary people, it reflects the deeply ingrained feudal consciousness in the cultural mindset of the nation, leading the audience from reflecting on history and the present to thinking about the future. The use of a clear modern consciousness to deeply explore the artistic content of the subject matter is also prominently demonstrated in the new historical play "The Soul of the Khitan." The success of this play lies in reflecting the life and culture of a region and a minority nationality from the perspective of the overall culture of the Chinese nation. In the intertwining of blood and fire, love and hate, it has created a three-dimensional and radiant image of Empress Dowager Xiao. This play's excavation and grasp of the artistic content of the subject matter, to some extent, not only elevates Peking Opera but also the entire opera in the creation of minority nationality themes to a new level.

Second, the pursuit of overall artistic effects by fully leveraging Peking Opera's strength in singing has made the performance form of Peking Opera more perfect and richer. Peking Opera evolved from the folk storytelling "Lotus Fall" and folk dance "Bouncing." In its early stages, singing was its primary means of expression and performance, with minimal dialogue and dance being simple movements that accompanied singing. This formed Peking Opera's artistic characteristic of excelling in singing. Particularly as the Peking Opera roles evolved from the initial division of male and female roles to "three small plays" of sheng, dan, and chou, and then to a full range of roles, its singing style gradually borrowed and absorbed, forming a unique expressive structure and artistic charm of the plate variation system, establishing the artistic status of Peking Opera. Many famous Peking Opera performers have also won the love of the audience with their unique singing skills. However, opera is a comprehensive art. If, in the initial stage of opera development and in past eras when the audience's aesthetic choices were relatively singular, opera could rely on singing to showcase its artistic charm and attract the audience, then in today's era where the comprehensive nature of opera art is increasingly recognized and emphasized, and contemporary audiences' aesthetic choices are developing towards wholeness and diversity, opera cannot rely solely on singing to stand in the forest of arts. It can even be said that the advantage of opera lies in its comprehensive nature, in its fusion of various artistic means such as song, dance, and drama, and in its ability to provide audiences with a variety of artistic enjoyment. Peking Opera is no exception. This requires today's Peking Opera art, based on fully leveraging its strength in singing, to develop towards the comprehensive and integrated artistic effects of opera. From many plays in the "Revival of Peking Opera Exchange Performance," it can be seen that the pursuit in this aspect is quite evident. First of all, in the exploration and development of singing styles, many plays have made new breakthroughs and developments, both in the design of singing styles and in the singing techniques of performers. In this exchange performance, the singing style design of the modern play "Willows by the Village" was highly praised. This play did not rigidly adhere to the plate structure of Peking Opera singing styles but considered both the needs of dramatic artistic expression and the technical conditions of the performers, blending and combining the singing styles. The use of many small segments of soft singing is a bold and successful reform for Peking Opera singing styles. The singing style of the modern play "The Windy Widow" also skillfully incorporates many tunes from Northeast Yangge opera. Secondly, it has strengthened the role of directors in the artistic integration of opera and fully mobilized the artistic creativity of stage art designers and other artistic workers, presenting a new look for Peking Opera in its performance form. For example, in handling and grasping the characters' personalities, destinies, and their relationships, the precise stage props handling, and the creation of a stage artistic atmosphere rich in connotations in "The Soul of the Khitan," and the director's skillful absorption and daring exploration in "The River of Love," all left a deep impression on the audience. The emphasis on directing art and the full display of the role of directing art in Peking Opera art can be said to be a significant shift from the long-standing single artistic production mode centered around roles. In the field of stage art design and other artistic creations, the impression from this exchange performance is that Peking Opera artists have shown a strong creative consciousness and innovative spirit, both in concept and technique. While considering the local colors of specific artistic content and the artistic regulations of the Peking Opera genre, they boldly explore, and many plays have shown distinct characteristics and personalities, achieving certain successes.

    探索·开拓·发展
    ——“振兴评剧交流演出”印象
    简光
    文化部于今年五月在沈阳主办的“振兴评剧交流演出”是建国以来我国评剧艺术界的首次盛会，来自黑龙江、吉林、辽宁、河北、北京和天津四省二市的18个评剧院团和艺校演出了20台不同类型的新排、新编剧目。这次交流演出比较全面地反映了目前我国评剧艺术发展中在剧目创作和人才培养方面的基本状况，也比较充分地体现了广大评剧艺术工作者对发展评剧艺术的热情与关心，以及在评剧艺术发展中所作的种种努力与探索。
    这次交流演出评出了《风流寡妇》、《村南柳》、《契丹魂》和《多情的河》等七台优秀剧目，综观这批优秀剧目，给人的突出印象是目前评剧艺术的发展无论在艺术内容上还是艺术形式上，都已形成了一种向更高层次探索突进的态势。这里，我想着重谈以下两点。
    一是以地域文化为主体的艺术内容的开拓，使评剧给广大观众呈示了从来没有过的艺术容量与艺术意蕴。地方戏曲往往是地域文化多种因素作用的结晶，反过来看，地方戏曲又往往在表现地域文化、以地方生活的风俗人情为其艺术内容方面有一种血缘式的便利。评剧主要流行于华北和东北地区，而正是这些地区的历史与现实生活构成了这次交流演出中大多数剧目艺术内容的主旋律，也正是这些地区的历史与现实文化背景构成了目前评剧艺术文化氛围的主色调。燕赵大地的悲剧与喜剧，松辽平原的昨天与今天，白山黑水间的历史与现实……构成了一幅目前评剧艺术内容的斑斓地图。重要的是，许多剧目在表现这种地方生活和地域文化时，突破了单纯展示地域风俗人情的浅层艺术内涵，在历史与时代的大文化背景下以鲜明的现代意识对这种地方生活和地域文化加以艺术审视和审美把握，开掘出了十分深刻的艺术意蕴。像《村南柳》通过历史与现实的时空交替对于封建伦理观念与经济、政治等各种因素纠缠在一起所造成的一代又一代善良人的爱情悲剧的把握，既不是停留在政治上批判这种封建伦理观念，也不是停留在道德上否定这种封建伦理观念，而是潜进到文化层次、文化心理去观照，去反思，通过普通人充满悲剧意味的感情生活折射出了民族文化心态结构中积淀深沉的封建意识，这就使观众从反思历史与现实进一步走向对未来的思考。用鲜明的现代意识对于题材所蕴含的艺术内容的深入开拓，在新编历史剧《契丹魂》中也有突出的表现，该剧的成功就在于从中华民族文化整体论的角度来反映地域的、少数民族的生活与文化，在血与火、爱与恨的交织中塑造了一个立体感极强、富有光彩的萧太后形象。这个戏对于题材艺术内容的开掘与把握，在某种意义上不仅使评剧而且使我们整个戏曲在少数民族题材创作上也上了一个新台阶。
    二是以充分发挥评剧擅长于唱这一艺术特点为主体的整体艺术效果的追求，使评剧艺术在演出形态上更加完善，更加丰富。评剧是在民间说唱“莲花落”和民间歌舞“蹦蹦”的基础上发展起来的。在最初的阶段，唱是其主要表现手段和表演方式，极少说白，舞也只是一些配合唱的简单动作。这就形成了评剧擅长于唱的艺术特点。尤其是随着评剧行当从最初的男、女角之分发展到生、旦、丑“三小戏”再发展到各种行当齐全，其唱腔也逐步借鉴吸收，形成了独具表现力和艺术魅力的板式变化结构体制，奠定了评剧的艺术地位。评剧史上许多著名表演艺术家也都是以其独具魅力的唱功深得观众喜爱。但是，戏曲是综合艺术。如果说在戏曲发展的初始阶段，在以往时代里观众的审美选择还相对单一的情况下，戏曲靠唱还能展示其艺术魅力吸引观众的话，那么，在今天戏曲艺术的综合性愈益被认识和强调，在当代观众的审美选择日益整体性和多元化发展的情况下，戏曲若只靠其唱是不能立足于艺术之林的。甚至可以说，戏曲的优势就在它的艺术综合性，就在于它熔歌舞剧美等多种艺术手段于一炉，能给观众提供多种多样的艺术享受。评剧也是这样。这就要求今天的评剧艺术在充分发挥其擅长于唱这一艺术特点的基础上，向戏曲艺术的整体性、综合性艺术效果发展。从这次“振兴评剧交流演出”中的许多剧目都可以看到，目前评剧在这方面的追求是相当明显的。首先是在唱腔的探索和发展方面，不少剧目无论在唱腔设计还是在演员的演唱技巧上，都有新的突破和发展。在这次交流演出中，现代戏《村南柳》的唱腔设计是众口称赞的，该剧不是恪守成规地运用评剧唱腔的板式结构，而是既考虑到剧情艺术表现的需要，又考虑到演员的技巧条件，进行唱腔的揉和组合，许多一小段一小段轻声唱法的运用，对于评剧的唱腔来说是一种大胆而成功的改革。现代戏《风流寡妇》的唱腔则揉进了许多东北二人转的曲调而又恰到好处。其次是强化了导演在戏曲艺术中的艺术整合作用，并充分调动了舞台美术设计等多方面艺术工作者的艺术创造性，使评剧在演出形态上展现了新面貌。像《契丹魂》在处理和把握人物性格、命运及其相互关系，十分恰当的场面调度、精到的道具细节处理、意蕴丰富的舞台艺术氛围的营造等方面的导演处理，《多情的河》在导演上的善于吸收，敢于探索，都给观众留下了深刻的印象。评剧艺术中这种对于导演艺术的重视和导演艺术作用的充分展示，可以说是以往长时间里以角为主的单一艺术生产方式的一大转变。在舞台美术设计等各个领域的艺术创作方面，这次交流演出给人的印象是无论在观念上还是手法上，评剧艺术家们都表现出了极强的创造意识和求新意识，在考虑到具体艺术内容的地方色彩和评剧的剧种艺术规定的同时，大胆探索，不少剧目都表现出突出的特点和个性，取得了一定成绩。
