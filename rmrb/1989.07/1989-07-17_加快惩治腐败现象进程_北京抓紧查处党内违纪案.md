Beijing's disciplinary inspection system has adhered to the principle of strict party governance this year, decisively and resolutely investigating and punishing party discipline cases, effectively accelerating the process of combating corruption.

According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, in the first half of this year, the city investigated and punished a total of 902 party discipline cases, with 470 party members receiving party disciplinary actions. Among them, 55 were at the section level and 20 were at the bureau level. Of the party members who received disciplinary actions, 114 were expelled from the party, and some also faced legal penalties.

In the 27 major cases involving bureau and section-level cadres directly handled and investigated by the Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, 19 of them fell into this category. According to the analysis, these cases have the following main characteristics:

- Using their power to seek personal gain, taking advantage of their positions to exchange power for money.
- Leaders colluding with general cadres who manage money and materials, and with external business "clients," committing crimes together.
- Most cases of party cadres embezzling, accepting bribes, and extorting bribes occur in business dealings with individual and township enterprises.

It is reported that while the various levels of the Commission for Discipline Inspection are strictly investigating cases of party members, especially party cadres, embezzling, accepting bribes, and extorting bribes, as well as cases of moral corruption, they are also paying close attention to investigating and punishing serious cases of leaders abusing their power for personal gain and harming the interests of the people. In the first half of this year, the city investigated and punished a total of 67 such cases, with 36 cases already closed, and the rest still under investigation.

    加快惩治腐败现象进程 
    北京抓紧查处党内违纪案
    本报北京7月17日讯　北京市纪检系统今年以来坚持从严治党的方针，坚决果断查处党内的违纪案件，有效地加快了惩治腐败现象的进程。
    据北京市纪委统计，今年上半年全市共立案查处党内违纪案件902件，有470名党员受到党纪处分，其中科级干部55名、处级干部20名。在受处分的党员中有114人被开除党籍，有的还受到司法机关的制裁。
    在市纪委直接掌握和查处的27件局处级干部的大案要案中，有19件属于这一类。据分析，这类案件主要有如下几个方面的特点：
    ——凭借手中实权谋取私利，利用职务之便，以权换钱。
    ——领导干部与管钱管物的一般干部勾结，与外部业务“关系户”勾结，多人合伙作案。
    ——党员干部贪污、受贿索贿的案件大多数发生在与个体、乡镇企业的业务往来之中。
    据介绍，北京市各级纪委在狠抓党员，特别是各级党员干部贪污、受贿索贿案件、腐化堕落案件的同时，也十分注意抓紧查处领导干部侵犯群众利益的严重以权谋私案件。今年上半年，全市共立案查处67件，已结案36件，其余案件正在查处之中。
