According to reports from South Africa, Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, submitted a statement regarding his meeting with South African President P.W. Botha on July 10th. The statement was handed over to the prison authorities 80 minutes after Mandela met with his wife, Winnie Mandela, at a prison near Paarl, Cape Town.

The specific contents of the statement are not yet known.

Reports quote a spokesperson from the South African Council of Churches as saying that Mandela requested the public release of his statement to inform the people.

People in Pretoria believe that Botha's meeting with Mandela is a move to create conditions for the release of the imprisoned ANC leader, as a final gesture by his government before the September elections and his potential departure from office.

Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the African National Congress in Lusaka stated on July 10th that anyone who believes this meeting marks the beginning of negotiations between South Africa's black population and the National Party government is mistaken.

    曼德拉就会晤博塔发表声明
    南非国大认为会晤不是与南非当局谈判的开始
    新华社哈博罗内7月11日电　据来自南非的消息说，被监禁的南非非洲人国民大会领导人纳尔逊·曼德拉10日向监狱当局递交了一份有关他同南非总统博塔会晤的声明。
    这份声明是纳尔逊·曼德拉10日在开普敦附近帕尔的一所监狱里同他妻子温妮·曼德拉会面80分钟后递交的。
    目前尚不清楚声明的具体内容。
    报道援引南非教会理事会一位负责人的话说，纳尔逊·曼德拉要求公布他的声明，以便通报人民。
    比勒陀利亚的人士认为，博塔会见纳尔逊·曼德拉，是在为释放这位被囚禁的南非非洲人国民大会领导人创造条件，以此作为9月份大选他下台前，他的政府作出的最后姿态。
    另一方面，南非非洲人国民大会的一位发言人10日在卢萨卡说，任何人认为这次会晤标志着南非黑人同南非国民党政府的谈判开始了，这将是错误的。
