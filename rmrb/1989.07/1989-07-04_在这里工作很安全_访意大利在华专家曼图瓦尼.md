During the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, Italian mechanical adjustment expert Mr. Mantovani, who was assisting in the installation and debugging of imported equipment at the Artificial Fur Factory in Wèihuì, Henan Province, was urged twice to return to his country immediately. However, after careful consideration, Mr. Mantovani decided to stay at his post until the installation and debugging tasks were successfully completed. On June 17, we went to the Artificial Fur Factory in Wèihuì to interview him.

"Before coming to China, I had seen the news about the disturbances in Beijing on Italian television. My company, wife, and children were all concerned about my safety and advised me not to come. I am very familiar with China. Over the past six years, I have assisted in work in cities such as Shanghai, Jǐnán, Shìjiāzhuāng, and Beijing. The Chinese people are very friendly. I believe that the disturbances in some places are temporary, and the vast majority of places are stable." Mr. Mantovani paused and continued, "The Artificial Fur Factory in Wèihuì has imported two shearing machines and two calendering machines from our company, Coma. This time I came to China mainly to install and debug these machines. I don't think coming to China will bring me any danger." He said, "I arrived in Zhèngzhōu by plane on the evening of May 31 and came to the factory on June 1."

Although Mr. Mantovani is in his sixties, he is in good health and has a friendly demeanor. He said, "In early June, I received two long-distance calls urging me to return to my country immediately for safety reasons. However, I saw that the workers here were working as usual, and the factory director and employees were very friendly, so I did not feel any danger. On June 7, I specially drove to Zhèngzhōu to call my company, wife, and children to introduce my work and living situation here and to reassure them."

Mr. Mantovani works very diligently in the factory. He said, "Now I see that the People's Liberation Army of China has won, and people are united and happy at work. I am very happy. In my spare time, I often sing. During the interview, Mr. Mantovani, at our invitation, happily took the microphone and sang an Italian song, 'Beautiful Florence Evening,' for us.

    在这里工作很安全
    ——访意大利在华专家曼图瓦尼
    王华林　刘晓梅
    北京发生反革命暴乱期间，在河南省卫辉市人造毛皮厂帮助安装、调试进口设备的意大利机械调试专家曼图瓦尼先生，曾两次被催促立即回国，但曼图瓦尼先生考虑再三，仍决定坚守工作岗位，直至圆满完成安装调试任务。6月17日，我们去卫辉市人造毛皮厂采访了他。
    “来华之前，我从意大利的电视新闻里已看到了有关北京发生动乱的情景，公司、老伴和孩子们都担心我的安全，劝我不要来。我非常了解中国，近6年来，我曾在上海、济南、石家庄、北京等城市帮助中国工作，中国人民是很友好的。我觉得个别地方发生动乱是暂时的，绝大多数地方是安定的。”曼图瓦尼先生停顿一下继续介绍说，卫辉市人造毛皮厂从我们考麦公司引进两台剪毛机和烫光机，我这次来中国，主要是为了安装调试这些机器，我认为来中国不会给我带来什么危险。他说：“我于5月31日晚上乘飞机抵达郑州，6月1日即来到工厂。”曼图瓦尼先生虽然年已6旬，但身体健康，态度随和。他说，“6月上旬，我接到两次长途电话，出于安全，催我立即回国，但我看到这里的工人照常上班，厂长、职工都很友好，并没有什么不安全感觉。6月7日，我专门驱车郑州，同我们公司、老伴和孩子们通了长途电话，向他们介绍了我在这里的工作和生活情况，请他们放心。”
    曼图瓦尼先生在厂里工作十分认真，他说：“现在我看到中国人民解放军胜利了，看到人们团结友爱，工作愉快，心里非常高兴，工余之时就常常唱歌。采访中，曼图瓦尼先生应我们的邀请，欣然拿起了采访话筒，即兴为我们唱了一首意大利歌曲《美丽的佛罗伦萨晚上》。
