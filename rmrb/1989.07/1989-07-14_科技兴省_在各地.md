**An Exciting Trend**

A new trend of relying on scientific and technological progress to revitalize local economies and promote social development is sweeping across China from east to west and from north to south.

Information obtained by the reporter from the recent national conference on relying on scientific and technological progress to promote regional economic and social coordinated development held in Zhengzhou indicates that, as of now, 15 provinces and autonomous regions have made decisions to implement "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province (Autonomous Region)." As for regions, cities, and counties below the provincial level, more than 70 cities participated in the "Science and Technology to Revitalize the City" discussion held in Liuzhou, Guangxi, at the end of last year. In the past year and a half, Heilongjiang Province has had 7 regions, cities, 46 counties, and 3 industries implement "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Region," "Science and Technology to Revitalize the City," "Science and Technology to Revitalize the County," and "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Industry" according to their own actual conditions.

A nation that for thousands of years has mainly relied on physical labor, resources, and equipment to drive economic development has finally, from the highest leadership to the grassroots masses, through extensive practice, recognized and begun to consciously rely on the power of science and technology and intelligence to drive the wheels of economic and social progress forward.

**Jiangsu: "Revitalization" is the Only Way Forward**

1988 was a pivotal year for Jiangsu Province in establishing the strategy of "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province."

In the overall development of China's economy, Jiangsu, with its significant position, has put forward the strategic decision of "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province." How did the comrades in Jiangsu consider this issue? Wu Dagao, Director of the Policy Research Office of the Jiangsu Science and Technology Commission, briefed the reporter as follows: For a long time, the province's economic development has mainly relied on extensive expansion of reproduction. Since 1986, they have conducted more than 30 special investigations around science and technology and economic and social development, which showed that in the past 10 years, the growth rate of the province's output value was lower than the growth rate of capital investment. Since the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the contribution of technological progress to industrial economic growth in the province has significantly decreased. This has allowed some unfavorable factors in the province's economic life to continue to develop, and issues such as rapid price increases have further exacerbated the contradictions. The severe economic situation undeniably indicates that the path of relying mainly on large amounts of capital investment and resource consumption to achieve economic development can no longer continue.

After more than a year of discussion and preparation, the various levels of leadership in Jiangsu Province generally believe that it is necessary to completely abandon the traditional extensive economic development model of expanding reproduction and achieve a fundamental transformation of the strategic guidelines for economic and social development. Deputy Governor and Director of the Provincial Science and Technology Commission Wu Sijun believes that the current environment of "rectification" and "adjustment" provides an extremely good opportunity for the implementation of a new development strategy. At the end-of-year provincial science and technology work conference, then Governor Gu Xiuyan said with a wave of her hand, "Jiangsu must seek development by combining a flexible operating mechanism with advanced science and technology and scientific management." Jiangsu can only take the path of "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province." Only by revitalizing can there be a way forward.

**Shaanxi: A Practical and Effective Main Battlefield**

In April 1988, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Government established "Education as the Foundation, Science and Technology to Revitalize Shaanxi" as the strategic guideline for the province's economic and social development. They believe this is the best choice for the province's future development strategy.

Comrades from Shaanxi Province, who have taken the lead in the aspect of "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province," believe that proposing a strategic slogan is not difficult, but the difficulty lies in how to propose practical and feasible strategic steps and specific tasks, so that the overall strategy does not become a fashionable slogan but becomes the concrete actions of various regions and departments. Shaanxi Province's initial practice provides enlightenment.

When formulating the "Outline for Science and Technology to Revitalize Shaanxi," the province, after repeated demonstrations, determined the long-term (to the year 2000), medium-term (5 years), and short-term (current year) development goals. The main battlefield they are currently implementing is called the "51251 Project." That is, from 1987 to 1992, from the province's research institutions, colleges and universities, large and medium-sized enterprises, party and government agencies, and central units in Shaanxi, through various forms such as dispatch, on-site work, part-time work, and unpaid leave, mobilize and organize 50,000 (1/10 of the province) scientific and technological personnel to enter medium and small enterprises and economically weak areas in rural areas, undertake or participate in the development of 10,000 industrial projects and 20 million mu of planting industry, as well as a considerable number of breeding industries. By 1992, an annual increase of 5 billion yuan in output value and 1 billion yuan in taxes and profits will be achieved. People believe this is an "accelerator" for converting the province's scientific and technological advantages into productive forces, a "bonding agent" for combining science and technology with the economy, and a "catalyst" for making various resources play their roles, which will have a far-reaching impact on the province's economic and social development.

Currently, implementing the strategic guideline of "Science and Technology to Revitalize Shaanxi" and the "51251 Project" plan has become a hot topic and urgent action for all levels of leadership and the masses in the province, showing a good start of unity and concerted efforts to revitalize Shaanxi through science and technology. They are determined to link up and develop in a rolling manner.

**Liaoning: Strengthening the Financial Support System**

Insufficient funds have been a major constraint on scientific and technological progress for many years. In the process of implementing "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province," this problem is also encountered. What is the solution?

Some provinces have changed their previous investment ideas, converting part of the funds previously directly invested in economic construction into investments in scientific and technological progress and intellectual development. Provinces such as Hunan have instructed various specialized banks to set up special funds for scientific and technological loans, and Tianjin has established a scientific and technological loan subject in banks, thus providing a stable source of funds for scientific and technological loans. Since 1986, Tianjin Municipality has allocated 10 million yuan annually for the construction of scientific and technological development bases and pilot production bases, strengthening the intermediate link of converting scientific and technological achievements into productive forces. Some provinces have stipulated that 0.5% to 2% of enterprise sales revenue be allocated as scientific and technological development funds. Gansu allows 10% to 15% of enterprise production development funds to be allocated as enterprise technological development funds, and the depreciation rate of fixed assets can be increased to 6% to 10%.

In terms of expanding the sources of funds for scientific and technological progress, Liaoning Province has introduced several effective measures: for example, they have implemented the scientific and technological departments, banks, and financial departments working closely together to activate the circulation of funds and expand scientific and technological loans. The Shenyang Municipal Science and Technology Commission deposited 20 million yuan in scientific and technological business funds in the bank, and the bank issued 200 million yuan in scientific and technological loans, instantly increasing the scientific and technological funds by 10 times. The work of extracting scientific and technological development funds from enterprise sales revenue was piloted in six cities including Fushun and Dalian last year. According to this regulation, Dandong City alone extracted a total of more than 27 million yuan last year. According to statistics from the financial department, the scientific and technological development funds extracted by enterprises in the province in 1988 were not less than 2 billion yuan. This is almost twice the amount of the National Natural Science Foundation. The Shenyang Automobile Industry Company extracted 8.3 million yuan in scientific and technological development funds at a rate of 1% in 1988, which was used for the company's 32 scientific and technological development projects. Within the year, 7 projects were completed and put into production, creating an output value of 2.3 billion yuan and tax profits of more than 45 million yuan. A responsible person from the company spoke enthusiastically about this matter. He said, "At first, people were not willing to accept this method, but the hard facts educated everyone." Now, many enterprises in the province have a positive response to this regulation. They believe that this can provide a stable source of funds for enterprise scientific and technological development, which is beneficial to enhancing the enterprise's momentum and promoting enterprise technological progress.

The province has also stipulated that scientific and technological appropriations must be increased at least in proportion to the growth of regular financial revenues, and that scientific and technological development funds must be established from the province, city, to county, and township levels, and that industry-specific scientific and technological development funds must be established. The province has also established scientific and technological venture capital companies.

**Avoid "Rushing In"**

Relying on scientific and technological progress to promote economic and social coordinated development is an inevitable path. However, should everyone propose "Science and Technology to Revitalize the Province (City)"? When is it appropriate to propose it? During the interview, comrades from various places unanimously expressed that "one should be cautious and take a prudent attitude." Because to achieve this strategic decision, the highest leadership must first have a consensus, have a sense of urgency and crisis about relying on scientific and technological progress; have a scientific analysis of the provincial and municipal conditions; have a certain amount of scientific and technological strength, financial investment, and various supporting systems and matching measures that are adaptable. Otherwise, it is easy to become formalistic. The reporter learned that China's three major cities, Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, have not yet made this decision, but in fact, they are all implementing the spirit of "Science and Technology to Revitalize the City." For example, after summarizing the experience and lessons of economic and social development over the past few decades, Shanghai City realized that to effectively reverse the severe situation of lack of momentum in industrial production and the financial "slump," the only way out is to rely on scientific and technological progress. For this reason, Mayor Zhu Rongji personally took charge of the production line of domestically produced cars, large-scale integrated circuits, and other industrial products that affect Shanghai's future economic development. At the same time, 7 deputy mayors all spared no effort to promote the scientific and technological progress of the industries they were in charge of. They used every means to mobilize the Shanghai and even the outside scientific and technological forces to enter the main battlefield of economic construction, striving to make the city's economic and social development enter the track of relying on scientific and technological progress as soon as possible. Beijing City, on the other hand, has implemented the Industrial Technology Revitalization Plan in recent years, uniting the enthusiasm of departments such as science and technology, economy, planning, finance, banking, personnel, and labor, as well as research institutes, colleges and universities, factories, and rural areas through the approach of "working together to promote cooperation," effectively promoting the combination of science and technology with the economy, and promoting the coordinated development of science and technology with the economy and society.

    “科技兴省”在各地
    本报记者　王友恭
    令人兴奋的态势
    一个依靠科学技术进步振兴当地经济、促进社会发展的新潮，正在我国从东到西，从南到北的大地上兴起。
    记者从最近在郑州召开的全国依靠科技进步促进地区经济社会协调发展研讨会上获得的信息是，到目前为止，全国已有15个省、自治区先后作出“科技（教）兴省（自治区）”的决定。至于省以下的地区、市作出这一战略发展决策的，仅去年底在广西柳州参加“科技兴市”讨论会的就有70多个城市。黑龙江省在最近一年多的时间里就有7个地区、市，46个县和3个行业结合自己的实际开始实施“科技兴区”、“科技兴市”、“科技兴县”、“科技兴行业”。
    一个几千年来一直主要靠拚体力、拚资源、拚设备发展经济的民族，从最高领导到基层群众终于通过大量的实践认识到，并在实际上开始自觉地依靠科学技术的力量、智慧的力量推动经济社会前进的巨轮。
    江苏：“兴”起来才有出路
    1988年，作为确立“科技兴省”战略的重要年头载入江苏省的史册。
    在我国经济发展全局中占有举足轻重地位的江苏推出“科技兴省”这一战略决策，该省的同志是怎样考虑这一问题的？参与这一重大系统工程设计的江苏科委政研室主任吴达高向记者作了如下简介：长期以来，该省经济发展主要靠外延扩大再生产。1986年以来，他们围绕科技与经济、社会发展开展的30多个专题调查表明，在过去的10年里，全省产值增长的速度低于资金投入增长的速度。“七五”以来，全省技术进步对工业经济增长的贡献份额明显下降。这使该省经济生活中的一些不利因素继续发展，物价上涨过猛等更加剧了矛盾。严峻的经济形势无可争辩地表明，主要靠大量的资金投入和资源消耗来求得经济发展的路子再也不能继续下去了。
    经过一年多的研讨、酝酿，江苏省各级领导普遍认为必须彻底摒弃传统的粗放型扩大再生产的经济发展模式，实现经济社会发展战略方针的根本转变。副省长、省科委主任吴锡军认为，当前“治理”、“整顿”的大环境为新发展战略的实施提供了极为良好的机遇。在去年底召开的全省科技工作会议上，当时的女省长顾秀莲将手当空一劈，说：“江苏要想求得发展，必须把灵活的运行机制与先进的科学技术、科学管理结合起来。”江苏，只能走“科技兴省”之路，“兴”起来才有出路。
    陕西：切实有效的主攻目标
    1988年4月，陕西省委、省政府把“教育奠基、科技兴陕”确立为该省经济、社会发展的战略方针。他们认为这是该省今后发展战略的最佳选择。
    在“科技兴省”方面先走了一步的山东省同志认为，提出一个战略口号并不难，难就难在如何提出切实可行的战略步骤和具体任务，使总的战略不致变为一句时髦口号，而成为各地区、各部门切切实实的行动。陕西省的初步实践给人以启示。
    该省在制定《科技兴陕纲要》时，经过反复论证确定了长期（到2000年）、中期（5年）和短期（当年）三个阶段的发展目标。目前他们正在实施的主攻目标被称为“51251工程”。即从1987年到1992年的5年内，从全省的科研单位、大专院校、大中企业、党政机关和中央在陕单位，通过委派、蹲点、兼职、停薪留职等多种形式，动员、组织5万名（占全省1／10）科技人员进入中小企业和农村经济发展薄弱的地区，承包或参与开发1万个工业项目和2000万亩种植业及数量可观的养殖业，到1992年实现年新增产值50亿元，利税10亿元。人们认为这是发挥本省科技优势向生产力转化的“加速器”，是科技与经济结合的“粘合剂”，是使各种资源发挥效益的“引发剂”，必将对全省经济、社会发展产生深远影响。
    当前贯彻“科技兴陕”的战略方针，实施“51251工程”计划已经成为全省各级领导和广大群众的热门话题和急切的行动，出现了上下一致，同心协力，依靠科技振兴陕西的良好开端。他们决心环环相扣，滚动式发展下去。
    辽宁：强化资金支撑体系
    资金不足是多年来影响科技进步的一大限制因素。在实施“科技兴省”的过程中同样遇到这一难题，解决途径何在？
    一些省改变了以往的投资思路，把过去直接投入经济建设的一部分资金转化为科技进步和智力开发的投入。湖南等省责成各专业银行设科技贷款专项，天津在银行中设立了科技贷款科目，从而使科技贷款有了一个稳定的来源。从1986年以来，天津市每年拨款1000万元用于科技开发基地和中试基地的建设，强化科技成果转化为生产力的中间环节。有的省规定从企业销售额中提取0.5％—2％作为科技开发基金。甘肃允许从企业的生产发展基金中提取10％—15％作为企业的技术开发基金，固定资产折旧率可以提高到6％—10％。
    在扩大科技进步的资金来源方面，辽宁省推出了相当有效的几招：例如他们推行的科技部门与银行、财政部门密切配合，搞活资金融通，扩大科技贷款的办法。沈阳市科委将2000万元科技事业费用存入银行，银行则发放科技贷款2亿元，一下子使科技经费增加了10倍。从企业销售额中提取科技开发基金的工作去年已在抚顺、大连等6市试行。据这一规定，仅丹东市去年就提取总额达2700多万元。据财政部门统计，1988年全省企业提取的科技开发基金不下2亿元。这几乎等于国家自然科学基金的2倍。沈阳市汽车工业公司1988年按1％的比例提取科技开发基金830万元，用于企业的32个科技开发项目，年内完成投产7项，创产值2.3亿元，创利税4500多万元。该公司的一位负责人谈起此事眉飞色舞。他说：“这个办法开头人们并不乐意接受，可硬邦邦的事实教育了大家。”现在该省许多企业对这一规定反响积极。他们认为这样可以为企业提供稳定的科技开发资金来源，有利于增强企业后劲，推动企业技术进步。
    该省还作出了科技拨款至少要按财政经常性收入增长的比例增加的规定，规定从省、市到县、乡都要设立科技开发基金，各行业要建立行业科技开发基金。该省还建立了科技风险投资公司。
    切勿“一哄而起”
    依靠科技进步来促进经济、社会协调发展，这是一条必由之路。但是否都要提“科技兴省（市）”？什么时候提出为宜？记者在采访过程中各地同志不约而同地表示“要审时度势，取慎重态度”。因为要实现这一战略决策，最高领导层首先要认识一致，有依靠科技进步的紧迫感和危机感；要有对省情、市情的科学分析；要有一定的科技力量、资金投入和各种与之相适应的支撑体系和配套措施。否则，难免流于形式。记者了解到我国三大城市北京、上海、天津都还没有作此决定，而在实际上都已在贯彻“科技兴市”的精神。如上海市总结几十年来经济、社会发展的经验教训之后，认识到要有效地扭转该市工业生产缺乏后劲、财政出现“滑坡”的严峻局面，唯一的出路是依靠科技进步。为此，市长朱熔基亲自抓国产小汽车生产线、大规模集成电路等影响上海未来经济发展的14项工业产品会战。与此同时，7个副市长都下大力气抓所分管行业的科技进步工作。他们千方百计调动上海乃至外地各路科技大军投入经济建设主战场，力求使全市的经济、社会发展尽快进入依靠科技进步的轨道。北京市近年来则通过工业技术振兴计划等的实施，把科技、经济、计划、财政、金融、人事、劳动等部门以及科研院所、高等院校和工厂、农村的积极性统一起来，通过“联合起来抓联合”的路子，有效地推动了科技与经济的结合，推动了科技与经济、社会的协调发展。
