    Space
    Zhong Yonghua
    The sky, amidst the frequently rising buildings,
    Is becoming narrower and narrower.
    Some parts are like a river,
    Some are like a well,
    Some are like a narrow strip of sky.
    Thoughts are striving to expand and soar,
    Once they leap to the peak,
    The entire space suddenly becomes vast and
    Deep.
    The sky is high and the clouds are light,
    Spacious and bright.
    The entire new city also leaps,
    With wings spread wide.

    空间
    钟永华
    天空  在频频崛起的大厦中
    愈来愈窄了
    有的像一条河
    有的像一口井
    有的像一线天
    思路在拚力拓展腾升
    一旦跃上峰巅
    整个空间豁然开阔并
    深远起来
    天高云淡
    空旷而明亮
    整座新城也跃动着
    张开了翅膀
