Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 15th.

According to the Ministry of Finance, the economic benefits of state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget in China in the first half of this year have not been ideal.

According to the Ministry of Finance's financial rapid report statistics, in the first half of the year, the total industrial output value of state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget nationwide was 321.935 billion yuan, an increase of 5.2% over the same period last year; the total sales revenue was 438.504 billion yuan, an increase of 19.2% over the same period last year. The growth rate of sales revenue in the first half of the year was 14 percentage points higher than the growth rate of output value, mainly due to the impact of price adjustments in the second half of last year. In the first half of the year, the cumulative profit realized by state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget was 29.619 billion yuan, a decrease of 12.1% over the same period last year. The regions where profits decreased include Tianjin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Hubei, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Henan. Among the 24 industrial production departments under the central government, 11 departments saw a decrease in profits. In the first half of this year, the profit realized per 100 yuan of sales revenue by state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget was only 6.75 yuan, a decrease of 26.7% over the same period last year.

Since this year, the cost of comparable industrial products has remained high and has been increasing month by month. By the end of June, the cumulative overrun of comparable product costs for state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget was 18.6%, with an overrun amount of 39.128 billion yuan. By the end of June, the number of loss-making enterprises under the budget was 7,225, a decrease from the first quarter, accounting for 19% of the total number of enterprises. However, the amount of losses has increased sharply. The cumulative loss for January to June was 6.868 billion yuan, an increase of 1.22 times over the same period last year. The regions with relatively large increases in losses include: Tianjin increased losses by 4.87 times, Shanghai by 1.67 times, Liaoning by 1.66 times, Jiangsu by 1.52 times, Gansu by 1.38 times, and Hebei by 1.22 times. The central industrial sectors with significant increases in losses are: the petroleum industry increased losses by 2.3 times, the coal industry by 1.16 times, and the tobacco industry by 5.16 times.

Due to the significant decrease in profits realized by enterprises, the profits paid to the state budget (including income tax and adjustment tax) by enterprises have been greatly affected. From January to June, the cumulative profits paid to the state budget by state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget decreased by 42.84 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 41.4%. Among them, the central industrial sector changed from paying 2.638 billion yuan in profits to the state budget in the same period last year to a loss of 412 million yuan in the first half of this year; the local industrial sector paid 6.484 billion yuan in profits to the state budget, a decrease of 16% compared to the same period last year. Factors affecting the decrease in profits paid to the state budget by enterprises include the decrease in realized profits, with the main reason being the arrears of profits by enterprises. By the end of June, the arrears of profits paid by enterprises reached 5.544 billion yuan, an increase of 1.839 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. Additionally, although the profits realized by enterprises have decreased, the retained profits have not been correspondingly reduced. From January to June, the cumulative retained profits of state-owned industrial enterprises under the budget were 13.295 billion yuan, an increase of 0.6% compared to the same period last year.

    可比产品成本居高不下  亏损户亏损额急剧增加
    预算内工业企业经济效益不太理想
    上半年累计实现利润比去年同期下降12.1％
    新华社北京7月15日电  据财政部提供的情况，今年上半年，我国预算内国营工业企业经济效益不太理想。
    据财政部财务快报统计，上半年，全国预算内国营工业企业完成产值3219.35亿元，比去年同期增长5.2％；完成销售收入4385.04亿元，比去年同期增长19.2％。上半年销售收入增长幅度比产值增长幅度高出14个百分点，主要是受去年下半年调整价格的影响。上半年，预算内工业企业累计实现利润296.19亿元，比去年同期下降12.1％。实现利润下降的地区有天津、辽宁、江苏、上海、湖北、浙江、江西、河南8个省市；中央24个工业生产部门中有11个部门实现利润是下降的。今年上半年预算内工业企业百元销售收入实现的利润只有6.75元，比去年同期下降26.7％。
    今年以来，工业可比产品成本一直居高不下，并逐月提高。到6月末，预算内工业企业可比产品成本累计超支18.6％，超支额为391.28亿元。6月末预算内工业企业亏损户数为7225户，比一季度减少，占全部企业户数的19％。但亏损额急剧增加，1—6月累计亏损68.68亿元，比去年同期增长1.22倍，其中增长幅度较大的地区有：天津增亏4.87倍，上海1.67倍，辽宁1.66倍，江苏1.52倍，甘肃1.38倍，河北1.22倍；中央工业增亏大的是：石油企业增亏2.3倍，煤炭企业增亏1.16倍，烟草工业增亏5.16倍。
    由于企业实现利润大幅度下降，企业上交财政利润（含所得税，调节税）受到很大影响。1—6月，预算内工业企业累计上交利润比去年同期减少了42.84亿元，下降41.4％。其中：中央工业由上年同期上交利润26.38亿元，变为今年1—6月亏损退库4.12亿元；地方工业上交利润为64.84亿元，比去年同期下降16％。影响企业上交利润下降，除有实现利润下降的因素外，企业拖欠利润是主要原因。到6月末，企业欠交利润达55.44亿元，比上年同期增加18.39亿元；另外，企业实现利润下降了，但企业留利并未相应减少，1—6月预算内工业企业累计留利132.95亿元，比去年同期增长0.6％。
