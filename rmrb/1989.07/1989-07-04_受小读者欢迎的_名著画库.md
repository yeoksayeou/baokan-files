In recent years, there has been a significant decline in the sales of comic books, with many bookstores bundling unsold copies and selling them at extremely low prices. However, a series of comic books published by the Jiangsu Youth and Children's Press has become quite popular, winning the favor of young readers and their parents. This is the "Classic Illustrated Library," which has been a bestseller nationwide in recent years.

The "Classic Illustrated Library" is a large collection of colorful comic books based on the best stories from Chinese and foreign literary classics. The series is planned to include more than 20 titles, with 16 already published, totaling over 3 million copies printed. Among these, "Selected Classic Children's Stories from Around the World," "Selected Chinese Myths and Folktales," and "Selected Aphoristic Stories" were selected as top-selling books in two separate evaluations held in Beijing in the spring of 1987 and May 1988. Among the tens of thousands of books published by hundreds of publishers nationwide, the selection rate from Jiangsu Youth and Children's Press was over 1/7, a rare occurrence nationwide. Additionally, these were the only three children's books among the 20 selected bestsellers, making it particularly noteworthy among children's publishers nationwide. In the recent "China New Era Youth Literature Award" selection, "Selected Stories from Romance of the Three Kingdoms" from the "Classic Illustrated Library" was also honored.

The popularity of this series is mainly due to its carefully selected content, high-quality illustrations, and vibrant color printing. Furthermore, each book contains a large number of stories and is priced affordably, aligning with the purchasing power of Chinese readers. Each book in the "Classic Illustrated Library" contains 30 to 40 captivating stories. Overseas, such a volume of content would typically be spread across dozens of books, with a total price that would be prohibitively high. However, each book in the "Classic Illustrated Library" is priced at just over 2 yuan, making it relatively affordable and thus naturally appealing to readers.

    受小读者欢迎的“名著画库”
    辛轩
    近几年，连环画书滞销现象十分严重，不少书店将积压的连环画书打成捆，以极低廉的价格出售。然而，江苏少年儿童出版社出版的一种连环画却相当走红，受到小读者及其家长的青睐。这就是近几年畅销全国的“名著画库”。
    名著画库是根据中外文学名著中的精采故事编绘而成的一套大型彩色连环画丛书，预计出版20余种，现已出版16种，总印数已达300多万册。这套书中的《世界童话名著精选》和《中国神话、童话故事选》、《成语故事精选》，曾在1987年春季和1988年5月北京的两次十大畅销书评选活动中先后中选。在全国数百家出版社出版的几万种销售图书中，江苏少儿出版社中选的比例竟占1／7以上，这在全国尚属罕见。同时，也是入选的20种畅销书中仅有的3种少儿读物，这在全国的少儿出版社中更引人注目。在近期揭晓的“中国新时期少年文艺读物奖”评选活动中，名著画库中的《三国演义故事精选》又榜上有名。
    这套书之所以博得好评，主要因为它的内容选得精，绘画质量高，又是彩色精印。此外，故事容量大，价钱较便宜，适应我国读者的购买水平。名著画库中的每一种书，都有三四十个精采的故事。若在海外，这么多的内容往往要出成几十本，总定价之高亦可想而知。但名著画库中的每一种书，只有两元多。相对而言，比较便宜，它受到读者的欢迎是理所当然的。
