    "China Team Exploited Our Weaknesses"
    Iranian Coach Praises Significant Progress of Chinese Players

    Tonight, after defeating the Iranian team, the usually stern Chinese national football team coach Gao Fengwen revealed a different side of himself to the reporters who surrounded him. At the post-match press conference, he did not hide his excitement, sitting in the lounge and listening to his Iranian counterparts' comments.

    Iranian coach Moini admitted that his team had originally planned to score, but ended up in disarray. Although many believed the Iranian team did not play to their full potential, managing only 4 shots on goal throughout the match, Moini thought the main reason was that the Chinese team had exploited their weaknesses and improved as the game progressed. He said that in past encounters between China and Iran, it was always the Iranian team that emerged victorious. Tonight's result showed that the Chinese team had made significant progress, and that football develops through competition.

    After accepting the congratulations from the opposing team, Gao Fengwen said that the Iranian team remained a formidable force and still had the potential to win. The Chinese team was prepared to face their strong resistance in Tehran. We saw a glimmer of hope for qualifying from the group, but we cannot stop halfway.

    “中国队抓住了我们漏洞”
    伊朗队教练称赞中国球员进步大
    本报沈阳7月15日电  记者汪大昭报道：一向被认为不苟言笑的中国足球队主教练高丰文，今晚在战胜伊朗队后，把另一副面孔暴露给团团围住他的记者。赛后的记者招待会上，他没有掩饰内心的兴奋，坐在休息室里听着身边的伊朗同行发表评论。
    伊朗队教练莫伊尼承认他的球队原来打算进球，不料乱了阵。尽管人们认为伊朗队没有打出全部本事，全场仅有4次射门，但莫伊尼认为主要是中国队抓住了漏洞，越打越好。他说，中伊过去多次交锋，都是伊朗队得胜。今晚的结果说明中国队进步很大，足球就是这样在竞争中发展的。
    高丰文接受了客队的祝贺后说，伊朗队依然不失为一支劲旅，同样有获胜的可能。中国队准备在德黑兰对付他们的全力抵抗。我们看到了小组出线希望的曙光，但不能半途而废。
