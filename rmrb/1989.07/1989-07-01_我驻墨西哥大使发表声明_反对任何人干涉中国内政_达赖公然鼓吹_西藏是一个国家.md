Chinese Ambassador to Mexico Issues Statement Opposing Any Interference in China's Internal Affairs

The Dalai Lama Openly Advocates "Tibet as an Independent Nation"

MEXICO CITY, June 30 (Xinhua) — Chinese Ambassador to Mexico Shi Chunlai today issued a statement to the press, opposing any form of interference in China's internal affairs. He also criticized the Dalai Lama's visit to Mexico, stating that he opposes the Dalai Lama and certain "friends of the Dalai Lama" in Mexico who advocate the secession of China. He emphasized that Tibet is an integral part of China's territory.

Mexican television broadcasted Ambassador Shi Chunlai's speech to the press this evening. Earlier, the Chinese Embassy had distributed a statement regarding the Dalai Lama's visit to Mexico on June 28.

The Dalai Lama arrived in Mexico City this afternoon at the invitation of the Autonomous University of Mexico City for a three-day visit. In an interview with Channel 2 television tonight, the Dalai Lama advocated that "Tibet is an independent nation." When asked by the news anchor about his stance on the Chinese government's position on Tibet, the Dalai Lama said that his visit to Mexico is "non-political," but he believes that "from cultural, religious traditions, language, and geographical conditions, Tibet is a separate nation." The Dalai Lama also claimed that "Tibetans do not support the Chinese government's political system and oppose the Chinese military presence in Tibet." He reiterated his 1987 proposal for a so-called "Five-Point Peace Plan" as principles for negotiating with the Chinese government. Regarding the purpose of his visit to Mexico, the Dalai Lama stated that it is to "understand the different cultures and traditions of various countries and to promote mutual understanding."

Today, upon arriving in Mexico City, the Dalai Lama attended a "Peace Prayer Meeting" with representatives of various religions at the Metropolitan Cathedral.

    我驻墨西哥大使发表声明
    反对任何人干涉中国内政
    达赖公然鼓吹“西藏是一个国家”
    本报墨西哥城6月30日电  记者郭伟成报道：中国驻墨西哥大使石春来今天向新闻界声明，反对任何人以任何形式干涉中国内政。并针对达赖喇嘛对墨西哥的访问指出，反对达赖喇嘛及墨西哥某些所谓“达赖之友”分裂中国的言行；西藏是中国领土的一部分。
    墨西哥电视台今晚播放了石春来大使向新闻界的讲话。在这以前，中国大使馆已经于6月28日向墨西哥新闻界散发了有关达赖喇嘛访问墨西哥的声明。
    达赖喇嘛应墨西哥首都自治大学的邀请于今天下午到达墨西哥城进行3天访问。他在今晚接受电视2台采访时，鼓吹“西藏是一个国家”。当时，电视2台新闻主持人要求达赖谈谈他对中国政府关于西藏的立场。达赖说：他“对墨西哥的访问是非政治性的”，但是，他认为“无论从文化、宗教传统，语言与地理条件来看，西藏都是一个单独的国家”。达赖并声称，“西藏人不赞成中国政府的政治制度，反对中国军队驻藏”。并重弹他1987年提出的所谓解决西藏问题的“五点和平计划”等分裂主义老调，“作为同中国政府谈判的原则”。关于访问墨西哥的目的，达赖声称是为了“了解世界各国不同的文化与传统，增进相互间的了解”。
    今天，达赖抵达墨西哥城以后，出席了在首都大教堂举行的各宗教代表“和平祈祷大会”。
