In the spacious municipal hall of Braunschweig, Germany, thunderous applause and heart-stirring cheers echoed through the air. This was as melodious as the beautiful music played by the orchestra at the closing ceremony of the International Mathematical Olympiad. It reflected the joyous mood of the attendees and marked an unforgettable moment.

The six young Chinese participants in this international mathematics competition, after two days and nine hours of intense mathematical contests, secured the first place in the total score among the 50 participating countries. Four of them won gold medals: Luo Huazhang, Jiang Buxing, Huo Xiaoming, and Yu Yang; two won silver medals: Tang Ruoxi and Yan Huafu. The news spread, inspiring everyone. First, the Chinese living by the Rhine River, the overseas Chinese, were overjoyed, spreading the news to each other. This extraordinary achievement indeed astonished the hosts, including the Federal Minister of Education, Müller-Mann, and the Minister of Education of Lower Saxony, Hornemann, as well as the more than 300 representatives from the 50 participating countries.

The International Mathematical Olympiad was initiated by the United States, the Soviet Union, Romania, Hungary, East Germany, and other countries. Its purpose is to discover and cultivate young mathematicians. The organization was established in 1959 and currently has 42 member countries. In China, renowned mathematicians such as Professor Su Buqing and Professor Wang Shouren, who attended this event as an observer, along with many other senior mathematicians, initiated the establishment of the Popularization Committee of the Chinese Mathematical Society. They focused on selecting talents from middle school students across the country. Since 1978, every October, tens of thousands of students from various regions participate in mathematical competitions to find the next "thousand-mile horses."

However, Chinese youth participating in international mathematics competitions began only this year for the fifth time. Although China's participation history is short, the results have always been outstanding. From securing the second place in the 29th International Mathematical Olympiad in Australia last year, China leaped to the top in this year's competition in Germany, which was unexpected by both Chinese and foreigners. The chairman of the jury, Professor Arndt Engel from Germany, expressed his genuine joy and praise, predicting that China would be a multiple gold medal winner in future competitions.

Many friends from participating countries envied us and expressed their desire to learn from China. Our team leader, Professor Ma, said in his speech: "Our purpose of participating is to learn from other countries and improve our mathematical skills through the competition."

The competition ended, and the golden and silver medals were pinned to the chests of our young participants. However, these "little geniuses" knew that they must maintain the virtues of humility and caution. In the afternoon, they changed into neat and tidy clothes and, upon invitation, visited their elder siblings studying in Bremen. They walked together in the park, enjoyed the scenery by the Weser River. The Weser River was calm, but the hearts of the young participants were not. The new achievements brought them new motivation and aspirations. They visited the University of Braunschweig, where they were not attracted by the majestic buildings or the beautiful campus, but by the statue of the great mathematician Gauss. They gathered in front of Gauss's statue, and the famous mathematician seemed to be looking at these young people from China with his bright eyes, as if saying: Congratulations on winning the first place for China! I hope you will continue to strive and reach the pinnacle of mathematics!

Yes, China needs more "Su Buqings"; China will definitely have countless of its own mathematical giants like Gauss! (Reported from Bonn on July 24)

    为祖国争光的小“高斯”们
    ——记夺取国际数学比赛总分第一的中国小将
    胡君亶
    在联邦德国不伦瑞克宽阔的市政大厅里，响起了阵阵雷鸣般的掌声和扣人心弦的欢呼声。这是与国际数学比赛闭幕式上乐队演奏的优美乐章同样动听的“乐章”。它说明了出席大会的人们的欢乐情绪，表明这是一个令人难忘的时刻。
    参加这次国际数学大赛的来自中国的6位小将，通过两天9个小时的数学比赛，一举夺得50个参赛国的总分第一名；4名小将获得金牌，他们是罗华章、蒋步星、霍晓明和俞杨；两名获得银牌，他们是唐若曦和颜华菲。喜讯传出，振奋人心。首先是生活在莱茵河畔的炎黄子孙、海外赤子们喜上眉梢，奔走相告。这一非同寻常的成绩，确使东道国联邦德国教育部长默勒曼和下萨克森州文教部长霍恩曼为首的主人们以及参赛的50个国家的300多名代表感到震惊。
    数学奥林匹克比赛由美国、苏联、罗马尼亚、匈牙利、民德等国发起，旨在发现和培养青年一代数学家，于1959年成立了这个国际组织，目前共有42个参加国。在我国，数学界著名老前辈华罗庚教授和这次作为观察员出席的王寿仁教授以及许多数学界元老，发起成立了中国数学学会普及工作委员会，注意在全国各地中学生中选拔人才。自1978年开始，每年10月在各地参加数学比赛的数万名学生中寻找小“千里马”。
    然而，中国青年走上国际数学比赛舞台，今年才是第五次。我国参赛历史虽短，但一直成绩斐然。由去年在澳大利亚第29届数学大赛中获得第二名，一跃而在今年联邦德国赛场上夺魁，这是中外人士意想不到的。本届裁判委员、联邦德国的阿文图·恩格尔教授对此表现出由衷的喜悦和赞扬，并预言今后几届比赛，中国将会是多项金牌的获得者。
    许多参赛国家的朋友十分羡慕我们，表示想向中国取经。我国领队马教授在会上致词说：“我们参赛的目的是为了向各国学习，在比赛中提高自己的数学水平。”
    大赛结束，金灿灿、银晃晃的奖牌戴到我国小将们的胸前。但是，这一个个“小人精”深知，必须保持谦虚、谨慎的美德。下午，他们换上漂亮整齐的服装，应邀去访问在不来梅市学习的大哥大姐们。他们一起在街心花园散步、在威悉河畔游览。此时的威悉河风平浪静，可是小将们的心啊却很不平静。新的成绩给他们带来了新的学习动力和新的憧憬。他们来到不伦瑞克大学，吸引着他们的不是庄严雄伟的建筑、不是美丽幽雅的校园，而是那座数学大师高斯的纪念像。他们拥到高斯像前，那位著名的数学巨人正用炯炯有神的目光注视着这些来自中国的青年人，好似在对他们说：祝贺你们为中国夺得了第一名！希望你们再接再厉，勇攀数学的高峰！
    是的，中国需要不断涌现出更多的“华罗庚”；中国一定会出现无数个自己的数学大师“高斯”！（本报波恩7月24日电）
