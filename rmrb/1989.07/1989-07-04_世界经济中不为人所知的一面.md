	The Unknown Side of the World Economy

	The French weekly "Problèmes" published an article titled "The Unknown Side of the World Economy" in its 867th issue on May 1. The article is summarized as follows:

	On August 1987, the Italian Navy seized an old cargo ship flying the Lebanese flag off the coast of Bari. Inside the ship, they found one anti-tank rocket launcher, one Soviet-made rocket launcher, one American missile, 2 kilograms of heroin, and 15 kilograms of Indian cannabis. The Italian police arrested 32 people, including the head of an import-export company, a Canadian intermediary, and two Italian mafia members.

	This incident fully reflects "the unknown side of the world economy." Drugs, arms, and ships flying flags of convenience cause international financial circles to lose hundreds of billions of dollars annually, which is not reflected in the economic papers of economists.

	Trillions of dollars! Over the past 20 years, this astonishing sum has not been recorded in the official accounts of various countries. Globally, these unrecorded dollars have not been lost. The experts of the International Monetary Fund, to their shame, have listed them under the "errors and omissions" column. These unaccounted dollars have increased some private fortunes: in the list of the world's richest people published by the American magazine "Forbes," the Rockefeller family is right behind a Colombian drug trafficker. These dollars are the source of some abnormal phenomena. The total global debt exceeds the total credit, as if the entire Earth owes money to creditors living on the moon—how strange!

	The first source of this black money is drugs. Every year, drug users (who consume marijuana, heroin, etc.) spend between 200 and 300 billion dollars. For comparison, in 1986, automobile drivers consumed 135 billion dollars in gasoline. "Drug trafficking is not just a social phenomenon... it is also a non-negligible sector in the international economy."

	Everyone knows the importance of cocaine derivatives in the economy of the Andes Mountains. But did you know that the United States is the world's third-largest producer of marijuana? To prevent the cocaine derivative market from collapsing, drug traffickers, taking the example of OPEC, established the Medellín Cartel. The bosses of Colombian subsidiaries control market transactions. To open up new markets, these bosses introduce terrible substitutes into the market. These drug producers are so powerful that Colombians formally proposed to the government to settle the 14 billion dollars they owe to Western banks, of course, with the guarantee that they would never be extradited to the United States.

	"They will not export weapons like they export scarves," because drug and arms trafficking is the source of hidden wealth. Despite the fact that the global turnover is estimated between 30 and 45 billion francs, it is still not as high as the turnover of narcotics. Whether or not there are regulations, the sale of weapons is always shrouded in mystery. Customers consider the price: for example, they note that the F-15 fighter jets sold to Saudi Arabia by the Americans are twice as expensive as those sold to Israel.

	The seven major "offshore" financial centers in the world absorb one-fifth of foreign bank deposits, making them giants in the banking world. For depositors, it is profitable: banks can keep their deposits secret, and they can avoid paying interest taxes. The interest on deposits is rarely remitted back to the home country, but is used to increase the amount of black money. The business of these offshore banks is more or less legal, to the extent that their existence is not affected: from the management of property to the anonymous purchase of stocks for public bidding, and the laundering of dirty money.

	In fact, the cunning of these drug traffickers and robbers lies in the fact that they have their own banks. This is a way to avoid excessive dependence on "cash." A report from the Federal Reserve Bank says that five-sixths of the dollars circulating in the world are used for illegal transactions. The "Federal Reserve Board" is the main supplier of new bills for illegal transactions, which is surprising. It fully illustrates the inability of some countries to deal with the rise of the world's underground economy.

### 世界经济中不为人所知的一面

    世界经济中不为人所知的一面
    法国《问题》周刊5月1日出版的第867期刊登一篇文章，题为《世界经济的不为人所知的一面》，摘要如下：
    1987年8月，意大利海军在巴里海面捕获了一艘挂着黎巴嫩国旗的旧货船。在船舱里发现1个反坦克火箭筒发射装置、1个苏制火箭筒、1枚美国导弹、2公斤海洛因、15公斤印度大麻。意大利警方逮捕了32人，其中有1家进出口公司的负责人、1名加拿大籍中间商和两名意大利黑手党徒。
    这个事件充分反映了“世界经济中不为人所知的一面”。毒品、军火、打着方便旗的船只每年使国际金融界损失百亿美元，这在经济学家们的经济论文中是没有反映的。
    上万亿美元！20年来，各国的官方账本上没有记上这笔令人吃惊的巨款。就全世界来说，这些未入账的美元并未丢失。国际货币基金组织的专家们令人羞愧地把它列入“错误和遗漏”专栏中。这些未统计的美元扩大了一些私人的巨额财产：在美国杂志《福布斯》列出的世界富翁中，洛克菲勒家族正好排在一名哥伦比亚贩卖毒品商人的后面。这些美元成为一些畸形现象的根源。所统计的全世界负债总额超出了债权总额，好像整个地球都欠居住在月球上债权人的钱似的，怪不怪？
    这笔黑钱的第一个来源是毒品。每年，吸毒者（吸大麻、海洛因等毒品）要花费2000到3000亿美元。可以比较一下：1986年，汽车驾驶者消耗的汽油达1350亿美元。“毒品交易不只是一个社会现象……它也是国际经济中的一个并非无足轻重的部门”。
    人们都知道古柯叶制剂在安第斯山脉经济中的重要性。但人们知道美国是世界第三大麻生产国吗？为了防止古柯叶制剂市场崩溃，毒品商人以石油输出国组织为榜样，建立了麦德林卡特尔。哥伦比亚子公司的老板们控制了市场交易。为了打开新的销路，这些老板把可怕的代替物投放到市场。这些毒品生产者是那样有力，以致哥伦比亚人正式建议政府结算它欠西方银行的140亿美元债务，条件当然是获得永不把他们引渡给美国的保证。
    “他们不会像出口肖莱手帕那样出口武器”，因为毒品、军火贸易是形成隐蔽财产的根源。尽管全世界营业额估计在300亿到450亿法郎之间，但仍没有麻醉品的营业额高。不管有没有规定，武器的销售始终笼罩着神秘的色彩。顾客考虑的是价格：例如，他们注意到美国人卖给沙特阿拉伯人的F—15式飞机要比卖给以色列人的同类型飞机贵两倍。
    世界上7个主要“近海开发”金融中心吸收的外国银行存款占外国银行存款的1／5，可谓是银行界的巨人了。对存款者来说，是有利可图的：银行可为他们存款保守秘密，他们可免交利息税。存款利息很少汇回国内，而用来增加黑钱量。这些近海开发银行的业务多少是合法的，以致于它们的存在未受到影响：从对财产的经营到为公开出价收购股票的人隐姓埋名，以及为肮脏的钱洗刷脏名。
    实际上，这些贩毒者和强盗的狡诈正在于他们拥有自己的银行。这是逃避过多依赖“现款”的一种方式。联邦储备银行的一份报告说，在全世界流通的钞票中，5／6的美元被用来进行非法交易。“联邦储备委员会”是用来进行非法交易的新钞票的主要供应者，这是出人意料的。它充分说明一些国家对世界地下经济的上升无能为力。
