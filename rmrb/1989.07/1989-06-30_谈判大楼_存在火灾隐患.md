The Negotiation Building, located in Bāfāngjǐng, Ānyuán Town, is a two-story brick-and-wood structure with a red exterior, covering an area of 2,200 square meters. In September 1922, during the strike by workers of the Ānyuán Mine, Li Lìsān and Liú Shàoqí came here as the workers' full representatives to negotiate with the mine management. This building is a provincially protected cultural relic.

However, the first floor of the building is currently used by the Labor and Personnel Department of the Ānyuán Coal Mine. Every day, hundreds of people come and go, leaving cigarette butts everywhere. The electrical wiring is old and deteriorating. During the winter, the various offices of the Labor and Personnel Department burn coal stoves for warmth and store matches and charcoal in the corners of the offices. The eastern side of the building houses some migrant workers who often cook and heat their rooms with fires. The western side is the carpentry workshop of the Ānyuán Coal Mine, with sawdust and waste scattered everywhere. In winter, the carpenters gather firewood from the workshop to keep warm.

To completely eliminate the fire hazards in the building, the fire supervision department of Píngxiāng City has repeatedly urged the Ānyuán Coal Mine to take remedial measures. However, more than a year has passed, and the fire hazards in the Negotiation Building still exist.

    “谈判大楼”存在火灾隐患
    坐落在我市安源镇八方井境内的“谈判大楼”，系两层朱红砖木结构楼房，面积2200平方米。1922年9月，安源路矿工人罢工时，李立三、刘少奇先后作为工人的全权代表来此与路矿当局谈判。这座谈判大楼为省级重点文物保护单位。
    然而，大楼第一层现为安源煤矿劳资科使用，每天多则上百人，少则几十人进进出出，烟蒂到处可见，电线陈旧老化。每到冬季，安源煤矿劳资科的各个办公室都生炉子烤火，并将引火柴和木炭堆放在办公室的角落里。谈判大楼的东侧房屋住了一些民工，这些人常在房内烧火做饭；西侧房屋是安源煤矿的木工间，锯屑，废料遍地，冬季木工们就地取柴，在里面生火取暖。为彻底根除大楼火灾隐患，萍乡市消防监督部门曾多次督促安源煤矿整治。但时间过去一年多了，谈判大楼的火灾隐患仍然存在。
