"The Novels of 18 Tianjin Writers" is published by the Tianjin Social Sciences Academy Press. The book discusses writers who have made significant achievements in modern and contemporary literary creation. Among them are veteran writers as well as young rising stars. Although the book evaluates individual works, through the commentary on these writers who have lived through different historical periods, one can see not only the writers' creative journeys and literary achievements but also the shared historical background and the spirit of the times behind them.

    《天津小说18家论》
    《天津小说18家论》由天津社会科学院出版社出版。本书所论述的作家，大都在现、当代文学创作方面有较突出的成就。其中有老一代的作家，也有年轻一代新秀。虽然所评的是个别创作，但从对这些生活于不同历史跨度的作家群的评述中，不仅看到了作家的创作历程、文学业绩，也看到了他们背后有一个共同的历史背景、时代风貌。
              （刘宗武）
