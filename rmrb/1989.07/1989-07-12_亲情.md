Title: Affection

I started school and finally left the mountain valley to enter another world. Mother saw me off to the station, wiping her eyes: “Don’t think about home, strive hard; this valley is too narrow and confining. If you do well, you can stay outside!” I nodded and said, “I will.”

After graduation, I stayed in the plains, spending my days pushing through the bustling crowds, and somehow managed to acquire a bit of a “foreign” air. I also won the affection of a small-town girl. I brought my new wife home and told Mother, “I really am staying outside now. Leaving you two here makes me uneasy.”

Mother said, “In these three villages, only our family has someone living and working in the city. We’re happy about it, so you should feel at ease.” Mother thought her words were witty and chuckled to herself.

As time passed, whether due to work, laziness, or being captivated by the city’s lively atmosphere, I rarely returned home during festivals. Last spring festival, friends invited me to gather, and coincidentally, there was a truck going into the mountains to haul coal, so I sent a lot of festival goods and asked Mother to forgive me. After the festival, when I returned home, Mother’s eyes were red as soon as she saw me. I felt ashamed. Mother said, “I don’t blame you. As long as you come back to see me, whenever you return, our family celebrates the festival.”

When I returned to the city, I brought Mother with me.

In the evening, after work, Mother had already prepared the dinner. After eating, I said, “Let’s go for a walk?” Mother replied, “No need to walk, you’ve been out all day! Just stay and chat with me.”

Mother talked a lot, even mentioning how the lame old man’s dog gave birth and who bought the puppies. I poured her some tea, but she pushed it away: “When has your mother ever drunk tea?” She was in high spirits. When my wife started yawning, Mother said, “Young people are so sleepy!” Only then did she reluctantly go to her room, full of regret.

The next day, she continued chatting; the third day, she still chatted. Mother repeated the same stories every day. I knew she had been cooped up in the mountains for too long, so I listened patiently and responded enthusiastically from time to time. During the days Mother stayed, most of my free time was spent with her. On the day she left, she held my wife’s hand: “I’m fortunate to have raised a good son!” My wife smiled bitterly.

Not long after, Mother came again, and once more, she talked endlessly. Although I had a lot of things to do, she was my mother, so I had to listen to her enthusiastic but meaningless conversations with a smile. Over the course of a year, she came five times.

I bought Mother a television.

But Mother still kept coming out, and I didn’t understand, so I asked, “Is the TV interesting?” Mother pondered for a long time and said, “It’s interesting, but those people on TV cry when they want to and laugh when they want to. I have no control over them.” “Then you can chat with Father and your brothers,” I said. Mother suddenly frowned: “Don’t mention them; they dislike everything I say. Only you understand me, you’re truly educated.”

Later, for half a year, Mother didn’t come again. One day, while walking around the street, I bumped into an old man from our village who was out running errands, so I asked him about Mother’s situation. Old Man Li said, “Your mother is strange. She’s already half in the grave, but she joined the village’s stone-cutting team, carrying stones on her back every day!” I wanted to cry. I understood Mother; she was using physical labor to seek a fulfilling dream. What a restless soul!

I asked Old Man Li to tell Mother to come out and stay for a while.

Soon, I received a package from the mountains, inside which was a pair of shoes tightly woven with hemp rope, with a note inside: “Mother is old, her feet are lazy.” This was written by Mother. When I was young, she had studied for a year in a private school.

That night, I couldn’t sleep, so I thought about Mother’s intentions. After thinking it over, I remembered my childhood. At that time, I studied in a primary school outside the village, and every day I had to walk eight miles of dry riverbed. The stones in the riverbed hurt my feet, so Mother made me thick-soled mountain shoes. Those shoes wore out every two months, and Mother’s hands were always busy with hemp rope.

Now, when villagers go out of the mountains, they still walk the eight-mile riverbed, but the stones under their feet are now smooth and round.

I suddenly understood Mother’s intention. Those shoes were actually a gentle reproach: although the small city is separated from Mother by a distance, if there is no barrier in our hearts, isn’t it closer than the eight-mile riverbed?

    亲情
    凸凹
    上学了，终于走出山沟沟，到另一个世界去。母亲把我远送到车站，揩揩眼角：“可莫想家，使劲儿奔；咱这沟沟里太窄憋，奔好了，就留在外边儿！”我点点头说：“一定。”
    毕业后留在平原，整日在熙熙攘攘的人群里挤来挤去，居然挤出了满身“洋”气，并且得到一个小城姑娘的喜爱。我偕新媳妇回家，对母亲说：“我真的在外了，留您二老在家，心里总不踏实。”
    母亲说：“这上下连三村，就咱家有个住城里办公的人，乐还乐不迭呢，你就踏踏实实吧。”母亲觉着自己的话说得俏皮，便兀自暗乐。
    日子久了，或由于工作或由于疏懒或耽于城里热闹的气氛，逢年过节我也很少回家。前年春节，朋友们约定分头聚聚，正巧有车进山拉煤，就托人捎去不少年货，请母亲原谅。春节后回家，一见面母亲的眼圈就红了，我感到惭愧。母亲说：“娘不怨，只要你回来看看，你啥时回，咱家就啥时过年。”
    回城时，我将母亲接了去。
    晚上下班回来，母亲早把饭菜弄妥贴。吃过饭，我说：“出去转转？”母亲回答：“莫转了，成天在外没转够？！就陪俺唠唠吧。”
    母亲的话真多，连瘸二爷家的狗怎么下崽，狗崽被谁买去都唠到了。我给她倒茶，被她推到一边：“你娘啥时候喝过茶？”兴致极浓。等儿媳妇打出连天的哈欠，母亲说：“年轻人怎恁爱困！”才极遗憾地走进她的睡房。
    第二天接着唠；第三天仍是唠。母亲每天都重复她唠过的内容。我知道她在山里憋闷久了，耐心地听，且不时发出积极的响应。母亲住的这段日子，我的大部分闲暇时间都被她占用了。走的那天，她拉着媳妇的手：“俺有造化，养了一个好儿子！”妻子苦笑。
    过了不久，母亲又来了，又是连篇不断的老话。我尽管有不少事要做，但她是母亲，只好面带笑容，听她热烈而无价值的谈话。一年的时间，她竟接连来了五次。
    我给母亲买了一台电视机。
    但母亲仍连连往外跑，我不解，便问：“电视好看么？”母亲沉吟良久，说：“好看是好看，那里的人说哭就哭，说乐就乐，俺拿他们一点儿办法都没有。”“那您就跟父亲和弟弟们唠一唠嘛。”我说。母亲突然沉下脸来：“甭提他们，俺说啥他们都嫌；就你知道俺，到底知书识礼。”
    后来有半年多，竟不见母亲再来。那日在街上踅摸，碰到出来办事的本村老栗，便向他打听母亲近况。老栗说：“你娘忒邪，都半截子入土的人了，竟在村凿石队报了号，整日里蹈着两只白薯脚背背挎挎！”我真想哭。我懂得母亲，她在用肉体的疲劳，追寻酣然的梦。这是一个不甘寂寞的灵魂啊！
    我托老栗捎话叫母亲出来，多住些时日。
    不久接到从山里寄来的包裹，里面竟是一双用麻绳密密纳成的“踢死牛”，鞋里塞着一张纸条：“娘老了，脚懒得动弹了。”这是母亲亲手写的。小时候，她读过一年私塾。
    晚上怎么也睡不着，便想母亲的用意。想来想去，竟想到了童年。那时，我在村外的垭口上读小学，每天要走八里的干河滩。滩里石头硌人，母亲便给我做底子极厚的山鞋。那路费鞋，两月一双，母亲手中的麻线便总是打个不停。
    如今村人出山，仍然走着八里河滩，只是脚下的石头，磨得极光极圆。
    我突然明白了母亲的用意，那一双鞋其实是一声轻轻的嗔怨：小城虽然与母亲隔着一段路，但若是心中没有隔膜，不是比那八里河滩还要近么？！
