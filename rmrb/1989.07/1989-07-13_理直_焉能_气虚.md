We often say “righteousness breeds courage,” but in reality, things are not always so. It is common to see the righteous becoming weak, while the wrongdoers become bold.

For instance, in some units, there are people with strong personal interests. They persistently demand unreasonable things for their own positions, children, money, and houses, and are as bold as bulls. Leaders, knowing they are making unreasonable demands, do not dare to criticize them boldly and justly, but instead offer vague and weak comfort and indulgence. Again, some who harm public interests are fearless, while those who see such behavior either pretend not to see or feign deafness, and do not dare to step forward and stop them boldly and justly.

This inversion of righteousness being weak and wrongdoing being bold creates confusion between right and wrong, blurs the distinction between good and bad, suppresses righteousness, and promotes evil, seriously corrupting social ethics.

Why does this inversion occur? First, some people are driven by personal interests, fearing loss and gain, and worry that boldly and justly upholding the truth will offend leaders, harm their “official status,” offend “brothers,” or lose votes. Therefore, they become like smooth pebbles. Second, they fear that their own actions are not clean and that being “bold” will expose their dirt. Third, some leaders do not support those who boldly and justly uphold the truth, and even make them suffer for their “stubbornness,” giving them a hard time. How can this not make many righteous people become disheartened and weak?

It seems that to restore the normal state where the righteous are bold and the wrongdoers are weak, on one hand, we should indeed advocate that everyone acts uprightly and boldly, making their “bones” strong. More importantly, leaders and those in charge of discipline and law enforcement must dare to clearly support righteousness and eliminate evil.

### “理直”焉能“气虚”

    “理直”焉能“气虚”
    王登平
    我们常说“理直气壮”，但现实生活中却不尽然，常见理直的人气虚，又见理屈的人气壮。
    比如，在某些单位有的人私心甚重，为个人位子、儿子、票子、房子方面的无理要求，纠缠不休，气壮如牛，领导明知他是无理取闹，也不敢理直气壮地予以批评，而是不痛不痒、软不沓沓地抚慰、迁就。又比如，少数损害公共利益的人无所顾忌，而那些看到这种行为的人或佯作不见，或装聋作哑，不敢理直气壮地出面制止。
    这种理直气虚，理屈气壮的颠倒，造成了是非不清，良莠不分，正气委顿，邪气上升，严重地败坏了社会风气。
    为什么会出现这种颠倒？一是有些人私心作怪，患得患失，担心理直气壮地坚持真理会得罪领导，有损“官爵”，得罪“弟兄”，丢失选票，因此，便似鹅卵石，圆溜溜，光滑滑。二是自己身上不干净，生怕因“气壮”而拔出萝卜带出泥。三是一些领导者对理直气壮地坚持真理的人支持不够，甚至使他们因“倔脾气”而遭打击，穿“小鞋”，这怎能不使众多的理直者气馁、气虚呢？
    看来，要恢复理直者气壮，理屈者气虚的正常空气，一方面固然应提倡人人都堂堂正正地做人，理直气壮地办事，使自己的“身子骨”硬起来，更重要的是领导者和执纪、执法者要敢于旗帜鲜明地扶正祛邪。
