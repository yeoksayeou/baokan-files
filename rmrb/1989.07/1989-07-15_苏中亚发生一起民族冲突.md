Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 14th.

A large-scale conflict erupted between Tajik and Kyrgyz residents in the Isfara district of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic in Central Asia on the evening of July 13.

According to a report by TASS on July 14, thousands of people participated in the conflict, and weapons were used. Nineteen people were injured, and one person died.

The cause of the ethnic clash was a dispute over land and irrigation water between residents of the two republics along the border. After the conflict, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Tajikistan ordered a curfew in three villages in the Isfara district. The first secretaries of the party central committees and the chairmen of the councils of ministers of the two republics have flown to the conflict area to handle the incident.

    苏中亚发生一起民族冲突
    新华社莫斯科7月14日电  苏联中亚塔吉克共和国伊斯法拉区7月13日晚发生了一场塔吉克族和吉尔吉斯族居民之间的大规模冲突。
    据塔斯社14日报道，数千人参加了冲突，动用了武器，19人受伤，1人死亡。
    这场民族械斗的起因是两个共和国边境的居民争夺土地和灌溉用水。冲突发生后，塔吉克最高苏维埃主席团下令在伊斯法拉区的3个村实行宵禁。两个共和国的党中央第一书记和部长会议主席已飞到冲突地区处理这一事件。
