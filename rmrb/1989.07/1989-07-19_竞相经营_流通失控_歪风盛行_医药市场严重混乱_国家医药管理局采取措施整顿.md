Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 19th. (Reporter: Gù Hónghóng) The spokesperson for the State Pharmaceutical Administration, Martin, announced in Beijing today that the State Pharmaceutical Administration will take multiple measures to strengthen the management of the pharmaceutical market to reverse the increasingly chaotic situation in the pharmaceutical market.

He said that in recent years, many places across the country have seen a chaotic pharmaceutical market. Various industries are competing to sell pharmaceuticals, leading to a loss of control in the macro-management of pharmaceutical circulation. Counterfeit and substandard drugs have flooded the market, and people's safety in using drugs cannot be guaranteed.

According to investigations by the pharmaceutical system, the problem of various industries selling pharmaceuticals is particularly prominent in the pharmaceutical circulation sector. For example, in Hunan Province, there are 7,161 pharmaceutical sales units outside the pharmaceutical system, with more than 60% being private and individual operators. In Anhui Province's Fuyang region, there are 1,877 state-owned, collective, and individual units selling pharmaceuticals, with over 300 pharmaceutical stores on just two streets in Fuyang City, most of which are engaged in pharmaceutical wholesale. In recent years, these pharmaceutical sales units that have emerged are mostly opened without authorization according to the state's "Drug Administration Law." The numerous sales units operating without adhering to the "Drug Administration Law" have resulted in a large influx of counterfeit and substandard drugs into the market. In 1988, the Fuyang region of Anhui Province handled 184 major cases of manufacturing and selling fake drugs, seizing 6,500 kilograms of various fake pills such as fake Terramycin, over 12,000 fake injection vials, 7.45 million fake erythromycin pills, and 1.12 million fake injection vials. The chaos in the pharmaceutical market is also evident in the continuous rise in drug prices, the severe damage to traditional Chinese medicine resources, the serious tax evasion, and the prevalence of malpractices.

Martin said that in response to this situation, the Pharmaceutical Administration will strengthen the management of the pharmaceutical market, especially the management of pharmaceutical wholesale markets. It is clearly stipulated that non-state-owned pharmaceutical professional wholesale institutions are not allowed to engage in pharmaceutical wholesale business without the approval of the provincial pharmaceutical authorities. Without the approval of the State Pharmaceutical Administration, no department or unit is allowed to engage in the business of chemical raw drug materials. Production and sales units are not allowed to arbitrarily set or raise prices; medical and health institutions are not allowed to sell drugs or preparations they have purchased or formulated in the market.

    医药市场严重混乱
    国家医药管理局采取措施整顿
    新华社北京7月19日电　（记者顾洪洪）国家医药管理局新闻发言人马丁今天在京宣布：国家医药管理局将采取多种措施加强医药市场的管理，以扭转医药市场日益混乱的局面。
    他说，近年来，全国许多地方出现了医药市场混乱的局面，各行各业竞相经营药品，使药品流通宏观管理失控，伪劣药品大量流入市场，人民安全用药无法保障。
    据医药系统调查，目前在医药流通领域百业经营药品的问题十分突出。如湖南省医药系统外药品经营单位就有7161家，其中私营及个体经营者就占了60％以上；安徽省阜阳地区经营药品的国营、集体和个体单位共1877家，仅阜阳城内两条街就有300多家医药经营店，大部分搞药品批发。近年来涌现的这些医药经营单位，大部分是不按国家《药品管理法》规定自行开办的。众多的经营单位不按《药品管理法》规定经营，致使伪劣药品大量流入市场。安徽阜阳地区1988年共查处较大制造销售假药案184起，收缴假土霉素等各种片剂6500公斤，改制注射针剂1.2万多支，查获伪造标签的假红霉素片等745万片，假注射针剂112万支。药品市场混乱还表现为药品价格不断上涨，中药资源遭到严重破坏，偷漏税严重，不正之风盛行。
    马丁说，针对这种情况，医药管理局决定加强医药市场的管理，特别是对医药批发市场的管理，明确规定非国营医药专业批发机构，不经省级医药主管部门批准，不准经营药品批发业务；未经国家医药管理局审批，任何部门和单位，一律不准经营化学原料药品，生产、经营单位不得擅自定价、提价；卫生医疗单位购得或配制的药品、制剂，不得在市场销售等。
