	Advertising Giant Wall
	The Spanish city of Barcelona has built a massive wall that has recently been included in the "Guinness World Records." This permanent structure is 15 meters high and 145 meters long. It is adorned with a variety of colorful and bizarre advertisements, logos, and posters from different companies, creating a dizzying array of visuals. This large wall, which encloses an ancient bullring, adds an incongruous modern commercial competitive atmosphere to the scene.

	Anti-Dog Long Wall
	This wall has an unrefined name but a significant function and is famous worldwide. It is the world's first "Great Wall." In the 1960s, Queensland, Australia, built this long wall to protect sheep in the pastoral areas from wild dog attacks. The wall stretches for 5,531 kilometers and is 1.8 meters high. The annual maintenance and management costs alone amount to approximately $500,000.

	Defensive Ancient Wall
	Located in Germany, this wall was constructed by the ancient Romans in the 1st century between the Rhine and Danube rivers for defensive purposes. It stretches for 584 kilometers and is one of the world's oldest and most famous walls, second only to the Great Wall of China.

	Musical Magic Wall
	In 1987, a marvelous musical wall was built in the Rueil-Malmaison metro station in Marseille, France. When people walk past the green wall, the electronic storage system inside automatically composes different melodies based on the strength and rhythm of their footsteps. The designer, Jacques Serre, is not an architect but a 29-year-old composer.

	Artistic Prison Wall
	This is the longest mural in the world to date. Inside the Pudu Prison in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, an artist who refused to be idle created this masterpiece. Over a period of more than 500 days, he completed a 2,626-meter-long and 4.5-meter-wide work on the prison wall, depicting local natural landscapes.

    奇墙名壁拾零
    广告巨墙　西班牙名城巴塞罗那建成了一道厚墙，新近被列入“吉尼斯世界纪录大全”。这堵永久性建筑实体，高十五米，长一百四十五米，各色五花八门、光怪陆离的厂家商标、广告和海报跃然墙上，令人眼花缭乱，使得这面大墙内的一座古老斗牛场更增添了不伦不类的现代商业竞争气氛。
    防狗长墙　此墙名字不雅却功能显著并举世闻名，是国外的第一“长城”。澳大利亚昆士兰州为保护牧区羊群不受野犬侵扰，于本世纪六十年代起筑起这道长墙，总长达五千五百三十一公里，高一点八米，仅每年维修管理费就要耗去约五十万美元。
    防御古墙　坐落在德国境内，公元一世纪由古罗马人在莱茵河和多瑙河之间为防卫守御而修建，全长五百八十四公里，是世界上除中国长城之外最古老的著名城墙。
    音乐魔墙　法国马赛市的吕斯特纳地铁站内于一九八七年建起这道奇妙的音乐魔墙，当人们步经绿色墙壁时，墙内电子计算机贮存器以各种乐符、短句构成的作曲系统会自动按行人走步强弱、节奏而编奏出不同旋律的乐声，设计者雅克·塞拉诺不是建筑师而是一位二十九岁的作曲家。
    艺术牢墙　这也是至今世界上最长的壁画巨墙。在马来西亚吉隆坡市区的普渡监狱内，其作者是一个不甘寂寞的艺术家，他利用五百多天服刑期在狱壁上完成了这幅长达二千六百二十六米、宽四点五米的作品，描绘的都是当地自然风光。
