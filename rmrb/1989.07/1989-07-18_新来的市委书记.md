The newly arrived municipal party secretary

Our city is a newly established prefecture-level city, formed at the end of last year. Although Municipal Party Secretary Zhao Jiebing is new to the job, he holds himself to a very high standard. Here are a few seemingly ordinary incidents.

Insisting on Queuing for Meals in the Cafeteria

Every time it's mealtime, the nearly 40-year-old Zhao Jiebing holds a lunchbox and queues up to buy food. Since he became a prefecture-level leader, he has always eaten in the cafeteria, sitting with the staff, chatting while eating, and getting along very well.

Because of his busy work schedule, he often is the last one to enter the cafeteria, and often encounters the situation where all the fresh dishes are gone. He then asks the kitchen staff to quickly stir-fry some leftover dishes for him to make do. Sometimes, there are no leftover dishes, and he doesn't bother the cafeteria, instead going out to eat a bowl of noodles from a street vendor to get by.

In February this year, several comrades from the Hunan Provincial Organization Department came to investigate the situation. Zhao Jiebing gave each of them a lunchbox and some meal tickets, and they all went to the cafeteria to queue up for meals. From then on, when the Municipal Party Committee holds meetings or receives higher-level officials, they all eat in the cafeteria, strictly following the relevant regulations, effectively stopping the practice of extravagant banquets.

Down to the Grassroots, Refusing to Eat Above-Standard Meals

Whether it's public funds or personal expenses, whether it's a restaurant or a private residence, no matter how much they invite him, Zhao Jiebing always politely declines to participate in eating and drinking.

"Going down with Secretary Zhao, you won't get to eat good food, and you still have to pay for the meals," a small car driver in the office said with a touch of respect in his "complaint." Zhao Jiebing goes down to the grassroots, strictly enforcing the standard of four dishes and one soup, not allowing any alcohol or beverages. If there is any excess, he will definitely criticize it. In April, during an inspection of a grassroots unit, there were two extra dishes served. He had the extra dishes removed before he started eating. No matter where he is, he always pays for the meals after eating.

In March, a higher-level comrade came to inspect work in Dayong City. The comrades from Zhangjiajie and Suoxiyu Management Offices called to ask how to arrange the meals. Zhao Jiebing said, "All four dishes and one soup, ordinary dishes, don't prepare any wild game or delicacies, don't serve alcohol, just ensure hygiene." The two management offices followed his instructions and received his praise.

Private Phone Calls and Personal Use of Cars, All Paid for

Zhao Jiebing has repeatedly instructed his secretary, "Private phone calls and personal use of cars must be paid for." Zhao Jiebing's family is in Beijing, and they have a phone, but he generally does not make private calls home. If he does make a private call, he will definitely pay for it immediately. In May, he made a call home and, after hanging up the phone, took out 10 yuan to give to the secretary to hand over to the finance department. At the beginning of the year, a friend of his (a high-ranking official's child) came to Dayong and made a call home. Zhao Jiebing also had him pay more than 10 yuan in phone fees to the finance department.

In April, he went to Changsha for personal business and, upon returning, paid 50 yuan in gasoline fees to the finance department. The road to Changsha passes through Cili County, and he usually stops in Cili for lunch. Zhao Jiebing, passing through Cili for personal business, did not make a phone call, did not notify the Cili County Party Committee, and simply bought a meal ticket at the Cili Reception Center, had a quick meal, and hurried on his way.

Fixing the Toilet Himself

One day at the beginning of this year, the flush toilet in Zhao Jiebing's residence suddenly broke, and water was gushing out uncontrollably. He rolled up his sleeves, reached into the water tank, and after tinkering for about 10 minutes, he fixed the toilet and stopped the water flow. He usually pays a lot of attention to saving water and electricity, which seem like small matters. If he hears water running in a room while passing through the hallway, he will open the door to check. If no one is there, he will first turn off the faucet tightly and later criticize the person. His secretary and several staff members have all been criticized by him for not turning off the water or lights. He has repeatedly raised this issue at meetings. At first, some office workers did not fully understand and felt that Zhao Jiebing was being too meticulous. But as time passed, they were gradually influenced and now the entire office has basically eliminated wasteful practices.

Giving Rides to Elderly and Children is a Common Occurrence

When Zhao Jiebing goes to the countryside, sitting in the car, he always pays attention to the people carrying loads on the side of the road, and as long as conditions permit, he will give them a ride for a while. He is particularly concerned about the elderly and children who walk with difficulty. During his time in Dayong, many elderly people and children who were pulling pigs or cutting grass have ridden in his car. In April, he returned to Dayong City from Wulingyuan District, and a common citizen flagged down the car. Zhao Jiebing personally opened the door for him, invited him in, and chatted with him all the way to Dayong City. In May, he went to the countryside and saw from a distance two elderly people carrying baskets uphill. He asked the driver to quickly catch up to them and invited them to get in the car. Although the two elderly people did not dare to sit because of motion sickness, they were so moved that they kept saying they had encountered a good person. His driver told us, "Secretary Zhao often lets the common people ride in the car. He has a good heart and no airs, he is a good official."

### 新来的市委书记

    新来的市委书记
    我市是去年底新组建的地级市。市委书记赵杰兵虽然新来乍到，但他对自己要求严格。现记下几件看起来很平常的事情。
    食堂就餐坚持排队吃大众饭
    每当开餐时刻，年近40岁的赵杰兵手拿饭盒，排队买饭。自他担任地级领导以来，一直在大食堂吃饭，和工作人员围在一桌，边吃边聊，很是融洽。
    由于工作忙，他常常是最后一个走进食堂，也常常遇上新鲜饭菜都光了，他便要炊事员随便炒点现饭剩菜凑合。有时，现饭剩菜也没有，他也难得麻烦食堂，转出去在小摊上吃碗面条对付了事。
    今年2月，湖南省委组织部来了几位同志了解情况，赵杰兵给他们每人一个饭盒，几张餐票，也去食堂排队吃饭。自此始，市委召开会议，接待上级来人，都在食堂就餐，严格遵照有关规定，有效地制止了大吃大喝现象。
    下基层工作，不吃超标准伙食
    无论是公款还是私费，无论是酒家还是私宅，无论怎样相请，赵杰兵总是婉言拒绝参加吃喝。
    “跟赵书记下去，吃不上好的，还要交伙食费。”机关一小车司机不无敬意地“抱怨”说。赵杰兵下基层，坚决执行普通四菜一汤的标准，不准摆任何酒类和饮料。如有超过标准的，一定会受到批评。4月，在一基层单位检查工作时，吃饭多摆了两个菜，他让撤下多的菜之后才举筷吃饭。不管在什么地方，吃饭之后都要交付伙食费。
    3月，上级负责同志来大庸市视察工作。张家界、索溪峪两管理处的同志电话请示如何安排伙食，赵杰兵说：“一律四菜一汤，普通菜，不要搞那些野味山珍，不要摆酒，只要保证卫生就行。”两管理处的同志照办后，得到赵杰兵的表扬。
    私人电话、私事用车，都要付钱
    赵杰兵多次叮嘱秘书：“私人电话，私事用车，都要付钱。”赵杰兵家在北京，家里有电话，但他一般从不给家中打私人电话。如打了私人电话，就一定当即付钱。5月，他给家中打了个电话后，放下话筒，就掏出10元钱，要秘书交给财务室。年初，他的一位朋友（系高干子弟）来大庸后，给家里打了个电话，赵杰兵也要他给财务室交了10多元电话费。
    4月，他因私事用车去了一趟长沙，回来后，给财务室交了50元汽油费。去长沙必经慈利县，且一般都正好在慈利吃午饭。赵杰兵因私事路过慈利，不打电话，不惊动慈利县委，迳自在慈利招待所买餐票，吃顿便餐就匆匆上路了。
    抽水马桶坏了，亲自动手修理
    今年初的一天，赵杰兵住房中的抽水马桶突然坏了，水哗哗地喷流不止。他挽起袖子，探手伸进水箱，折腾了10多分钟，修好了马桶，止住了水喷。他平常就很注意节约水电这些看来似乎是很小的事情。他从走廊上经过，听得哪个房间水响，就扭开房门看看，如没人，先把龙头关紧，以后还要提出批评。他的秘书与好几个工作人员都因未关水关灯受过他的批评。他将此类问题多次提上大会。开始，有些机关工作人员还不太理解，觉得赵杰兵管得太细了。但随着时间推移，潜移默化，耳濡目染，现在整个机关已基本杜绝奢侈流弊。
    小车顺路捎老人小孩是常事
    赵杰兵下乡，坐在小车里，总关注着路旁那些肩担背负的群众，只要条件许可，就要将他们带上一段路。对那些步履蹒跚的老年人和小孩，他尤其关切。来大庸的这段时间内，不少扯猪草割牛草的老人小孩都坐过他的车。4月间，他自武陵源区返回大庸市，一个普通百姓招手拦车，赵杰兵亲自给他开了车门，请他上车，和他拉家常，直到大庸市。5月，他下乡时，老远看见两位老人背着背笼上坡，他要司机快点赶上他们后，请他们上车。两位老人虽因晕车不敢坐，却感动得连声说遇到了好人。他的司机告诉我们：“赵书记让老百姓坐车是常事，他的心好，又没架子，是个好官。”
