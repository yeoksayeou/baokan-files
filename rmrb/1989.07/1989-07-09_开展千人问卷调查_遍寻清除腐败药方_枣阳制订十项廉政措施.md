The Communist Party and government of Zao Yang County in Hubei Province recently conducted a survey of a thousand people on how to eliminate corruption. The survey revealed that the public is most dissatisfied with five types of corrupt behavior: using public funds for extravagant banquets and trips; abusing power to extort and accept bribes; being a bureaucrat who does nothing and does not care about the people's problems; using one's position to gain benefits for oneself, relatives, and friends; and increasing the burden on farmers and making arbitrary levies.

The survey, which began in early April this year, also showed that the public believes the most effective measures to eliminate the above-mentioned corrupt behaviors are: strengthening the work of discipline inspection, supervision, and prosecution, and strictly investigating and punishing; establishing rules and regulations, and strengthening effective constraints on administrative behavior; and making the exercise of public power and its results public, and inviting public supervision.

"The supervision of clean governance starts from the bottom up, and the construction of clean governance starts from the top down" is the guiding ideology of the Communist Party and government of Zao Yang County for eliminating corruption. Based on the five "most dissatisfied" corrupt behaviors and the "prescriptions" proposed by the public, they have formulated 10 clean governance systems and measures. These include: measures to stop and deal with the use of public funds for extravagant banquets and trips, as well as the extortion or low-price purchase of materials from subordinates; measures to investigate and deal with the appropriation of public property under various names, the acceptance of bribes, and the prevention of party and government agencies from engaging in commercial activities to gain benefits, and so on.

At the same time, the Communist Party and government have also formulated open procedures and supervision methods for promotions, recruitment, and the transfer of rural residents to urban areas, and have made these systems and measures public, establishing a multi-channel, multi-level supervision system to ensure their implementation.

Once the systems and measures were formulated, the Communist Party and government of Zao Yang County did not hesitate to take action against corruption. So far, more than 70 units and more than 40 officials who had extorted or purchased materials from subordinates at low prices have returned over 30,000 yuan. For some units and individuals with serious offenses, they have also imposed disciplinary sanctions.

To thoroughly investigate the phenomenon of officials using their power to build private houses, the Communist Party and government recently conducted a thorough investigation into the sources of funds and materials for the construction of private houses by 454 party and government officials in the entire city. For the problems found, they have given economic and disciplinary punishments. They have also organized a special team to investigate the issue of 16 deputy bureau-level and above leading cadres building private houses in violation of regulations. Once the problems are verified, they will also be dealt with seriously.

    开展千人问卷调查  遍寻清除腐败药方
    枣阳制订十项廉政措施
    新华社武汉7月9日电　（记者施勇峰、通讯员陈惠明）湖北省枣阳市委、市政府最近就如何消除为政不廉现象，在全县进行的一次千人问卷调查表明，群众对利用公款大吃大喝；仗权索贿受贿；只当官不干事、不关心群众反映的问题；利用职权为自己及亲属、好友捞取好处；加重农民负担、乱摊派5种不廉现象最为不满。
    枣阳市委、市政府从今年4月上旬开始进行的这次问卷调查还显示，群众认为消除上述不廉现象的3条最有效措施是：加强纪检、监督、检察工作、严肃查处；立规章、定纪律、加强对施政行为的有效约束；对公共权力的行使实行制度和结果公布，请公众监督。
    “廉政监督由下至上，廉政建设由上至下”是枣阳市委、市政府为消除腐败现象而拟订的指导思想。根据群众提出的5种“最不满意的不廉现象”和开出的“药方”，他们制订出10项廉政制度及措施，其中包括：对假借各种名义用公款大吃大喝、游山玩水现象以及对向下级索要或低价购买物资的制止和处理办法；对以各种名目贪占公物，接受贿赂以及制止党政机关经商办企业捞取好处的查处办法等等。
    同时，市委、市政府还制订出提干、招工、农转非等工作的公开办事程序和监督办法，并将上述制度和措施公之于众，建立多渠道、多层次的监督体系，使之落到实处。
    制度及措施一经制订，枣阳市委、市政府在查处腐败现象时不留情面，敢动真格。到目前为止，全市曾到基层索要或低价购买物资的70多个单位和40多名干部已退款3万多元。对个别情节严重的单位和个人，他们还给予了纪律制裁。
    为彻底查处干部利用职权建私房这一腐败现象，市委、市政府最近对全市454名党政干部建私房的资金、物资来源进行了清查，对查出的问题，给予了经济和党纪、政纪处理。他们还组织专门班子对16名副局级以上领导干部违纪建私房的问题进行清查，问题查实后也将给予严肃处理。
