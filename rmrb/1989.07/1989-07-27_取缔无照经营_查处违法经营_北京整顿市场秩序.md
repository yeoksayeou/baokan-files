	Beijing has been conducting a comprehensive market rectification campaign since early July, focusing on eliminating unlicensed operations and investigating illegal businesses. Initial results have been achieved.

	According to reports, unlicensed operations in Beijing were rampant in the previous period. Some areas had black markets with over 5,000 illegal operators. In some suburban areas, there were even large-scale operations involving hundreds of households and thousands of people, specializing in the production and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, forming a complete "production-supply-sales chain." Beijing has mobilized various social forces, adopting a combined approach of block-by-block and comprehensive management to handle over 7,000 cases of illegal business operations and nearly 4,000 cases of unlicensed operations. Currently, unlicensed operations in busy areas and key regions of the city have significantly decreased. Several bases for selling counterfeit and substandard goods have been dismantled, including a "Glasses Village" in the jurisdiction of the Jinsong Subdistrict Office in Chaoyang District, composed of 198 outsiders, all of whose glasses were counterfeit and substandard products, which has now been completely shut down.

	Rectifying the book market is a key part of this market order rectification. Relevant authorities have taken measures such as clearly defining the scope of investigation and imposing strict penalties. They have seized and confiscated approximately 200,000 illegal publications, revoked the business licenses of some illegal vendors, and initially investigated a number of cases involving the production, publication, printing, distribution, and sale of illegal publications.

    北京整顿市场秩序
    据新华社北京7月26日电　（记者李莉）北京市从7月初起，以取缔无照经营、查处违法经营为重点，进行全面的市场整治，现已取得初步成效。
    据介绍，北京的无照经营活动前一时期十分猖獗，有些地区的黑市可达到有违法经营者5000多人的规模；一些近郊地区甚至出现多达上百户、人口上千、专事制销伪劣商品的大据点，形成了伪劣商品的“产供销一条龙”。北京市动员社会各方力量，采取条块结合、综合治理的方法，查处了各种违法经营案件7000多起，无照经营案近4000起。现在，市区各繁华地段和重点地区内无照经营现象已明显减少，一批经营伪劣商品的据点被拔除，其中有朝阳区劲松办事处辖区内一个由198户外地人组成的“眼镜村”，其眼镜均为伪劣产品，这次被全部取缔。
    整治书刊市场是这次治理市场秩序的重点内容。有关方面采取了明确清查范围从严处罚等措施，查封、收缴了违法书刊约计20多万册，吊销了一些违法经营摊贩的营业执照，并初步查清了一批制作、出版、印刷、发行、销售违法书刊的案件。
