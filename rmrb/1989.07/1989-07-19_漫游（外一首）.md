Title: Wandering (and another poem)

You deliberately linger at the end of the sunset
You tell people the sunset is beautiful
But you don't wait for anyone
If someone gives you a flower
You gently scatter it, piece by piece, spreading it across the sky

You enter the night, caressing the skin of the night
At this moment, you see love making the land shimmer with bright ripples

Still, the most beautiful touch is the gentle caress of the river
There are birds chirping on the riverbank
You open your wet hands, the water droplets cannot stand up
You calmly look at the sky, calmly look at yourself

You walk towards your shore, he walks towards his shore
Looking back, the most beautiful remains the most beautiful

    漫游（外一首）
    迟慧你故意停留在夕阳的尽头你对人说夕阳很美其实你不等谁如果有人送你一朵花你就缓缓地将它抛洒一片片地弥漫在天空你走进深夜抚摸着夜的皮肤这时，你看到恋情使土地泛着亮亮的波纹
        依然是最美的抚摸着缓缓的江水有鸟儿在江岸啁啾你张开湿漉漉的手水珠站不起来你平静地看一眼天天平静地看一眼你你走向你的岸他走向他的岸回头看一眼那最美的依然是最美的
