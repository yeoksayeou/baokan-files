Title: A Thought-Provoking "Paris Trout"

American journalist Peter Dexter's novel "Paris Trout" won the 1988 National Book Award for Fiction. The author became famous overnight, and the book immediately became a bestseller. This novel does not have an engaging plot or tense, exciting scenes. How it managed to defeat numerous famous authors and win the favor of the judges is worth pondering.

The novel is set in a small town in the American South after World War II. The protagonist, Paris Trout, is a white shop owner in the town. He is cruel and ruthless, always lending money at high interest rates and exploiting the poor blacks. Once, over a dispute about selling an old car, he had a quarrel with a black man named Pokey. He led his henchmen to Pokey's house to pick a fight. Finding Pokey out, he shot at his mother and a 14-year-old girl, killing the black girl. After the murder, Paris Trout was arrested, but he bribed a county judge with $20,000 and was released. He returned to the town, head held high.

This bloody incident was a test for the town's upper-class citizens. Most of them were cowardly and silent; some, including Paris Trout's lawyer, wanted to send the criminal back to prison, but they were weak and did not take decisive action, so they failed. Only a young lawyer (the son of a local pastor) stood on the side of justice and fought against the criminal. The novel meticulously describes the mental states of these characters, exposing their souls. The book points out that the white society in the town has a tradition of discriminating against and bullying blacks, treating it as a natural privilege. It is this atmosphere and soil that bred the demon Paris Trout, allowing him to run rampant without restraint. In court, he even claimed that his actions were justified, and falsely stated that the victim had shot herself. In a country that boasts of democracy and the rule of law, allowing a murderer to go free is a great irony. Compared to several decades ago, the situation of blacks in America has improved somewhat. However, racial prejudice still exists in the hearts of some people, and the Ku Klux Klan is still active, especially in the South. Dexter's novel, based on his personal experiences, is thought-provoking.

Dexter is 46 years old, born in Michigan, and grew up in Georgia, Illinois, and South Dakota. He has worked as a salesman for baby pictures, a clerk in a hardware store and a gas station, and even drove a beer truck. Later, he worked for the "Philadelphia Daily News" for 12 years. Once, for a report, he was beaten by thugs and almost lost his life. Now he lives in Sacramento, California, and writes columns for local newspapers. In the past five years, he has published three novels, the other two being "God's Pocket" and "Dry Branches."

    发人深省的《巴黎·鳟鱼》
    申奥
    美国新闻记者彼得·德克斯特的小说《巴黎·鳟鱼》获得了1988年的全国图书小说奖。作者名震一时，此书也立即畅销。这部小说并无引人入胜的复杂情节，也没有紧张惊险有趣的场面，何以能战胜众多名家而博得评委们的青睐，这是耐人寻味的。
    小说的背景是第二次世界大战后美国南方的一个小镇。主人公巴黎·鳟鱼是镇上的一个白人店主，他冷酷凶残，心毒手狠，一向在穷苦黑人中放高利贷，盘剥欺压他们。有一次为了卖一辆旧车与黑人波克塞尔发生纠纷，他带领狗腿子直奔波克塞尔家寻衅，适逢波克塞尔外出，便开枪向其母和一个14岁的女孩射击，打死了这个黑人女孩。凶杀案发生后，巴黎·鳟鱼被捕，但他用2万美元向一个县法官行贿，便被保释出狱，趾高气扬地回到小镇。
    这件血案对小镇的上等公民们是一个考验。大多数人胆小怕事，噤若寒蝉；还有一部分人，包括巴黎·鳟鱼的律师在内，想把这个恶棍送回监狱，但他们软弱无力，不采取果断的行动，因此难以奏效。只有一个年轻律师（本地牧师的儿子）站在正义的立场，同凶犯进行了不调和的斗争。小说细致入微地描写了这些人物的心态，把他们的灵魂曝光。书中指出，小镇上的白人社会历来有歧视和欺凌黑人的传统，把这当作一种天经地义的特权，正是这种气候和土壤滋生了巴黎·鳟鱼这个恶魔，使他横行霸道，肆无忌惮。在法庭上他甚至宣称自己的行为是正当的，还胡说受害者是自己开枪打死自己。在标榜民主和法治的美国竟让一个杀人犯逍遥法外，这真是一个莫大的讽刺。和几十年前相比，今天的美国黑人情况已有若干改善。但在某些人心中仍然存有种族偏见，三K党徒们也时有活动，特别是在南方如此。德克斯特在此时推出这部根据亲身经历写成的小说，是发人深省的。
    德克斯特现年46岁，出生在密执安州，在佐治亚州、伊利诺斯州和南达科他州长大。他做过婴儿画片推销员，在五金店和煤气站当过伙计，还开过运载啤酒的货车，后来在《费城每日新闻》工作了12年。有一次为了一篇报道他遭到暴徒的殴打，几乎丧命。现在他住在加利福尼亚的萨克拉门托，为当地报纸撰写专栏。过去5年中他发表了3部小说，其他两部是《上帝的口袋》和《枯枝》。
