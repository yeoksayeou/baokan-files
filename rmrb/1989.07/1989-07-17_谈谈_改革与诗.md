The topic of "Reform and Poetry" is highly relevant and worthy of extensive discussion. By studying and exploring this topic, we can strengthen the connection between poetry and reform, enhance poetry's relevance and contemporary significance, and create an environment conducive to "realizing the Four Modernizations and revitalizing China." This will also promote the development and evolution of poetry in both content and form, allowing it to vividly reflect the reforms. To correctly understand and handle the relationship between "Reform and Poetry," we must address several key issues from both theoretical and practical perspectives: reform as the main trend of contemporary Chinese society, contemporary life as the primary theme of poetry, and the need to both expose and praise life.

Reform as the Main Trend of Contemporary Chinese Society

Reform is a revolutionary movement in Chinese society, bringing about profound historical changes in our socialist society and the spiritual outlook of our people. It is a great cause closely tied to the fate and fundamental interests of the entire Party, the nation, and all ethnic groups. As contemporary members of society and poets with sensitive nerves, we should not only be aware of the reforms but also actively participate in them. We must correctly understand and handle the relationship between "Reform and Poetry."

To correctly understand and handle the relationship between "Reform and Poetry," we must first correctly understand and handle the fundamental and most important relationship between poetry and the lives of the people. The lives of the people are the source and foundation of poetry, providing it with the highest standards and the deepest roots. Only by drawing from the lives of the people can poetry become authentic and substantial. Once poetry is uprooted from the soil of the people's lives, it will inevitably wither and die. Our poetry is not just about meeting the artistic needs of the people; it is also about guiding the broad masses of the people in their struggle to "realize the Four Modernizations and revitalize China." Therefore, poets must seriously listen to the opinions and demands of contemporary people regarding poetry, think about and study the new issues arising from the reforms and opening up, so that their poetry can keep pace with the times and become poetry with ideals, aspirations, and passion. Of course, poetry has its unique ways and rules for reflecting and expressing the lives of the people. It demands a higher degree of spiritualization and active participation of the subject, being an art form with highly condensed thoughts, the densest imagery, the strongest emotions, and the most refined language. However, poetry is not floating in the air or a separate world; it is always closely connected to the lives, society, and emotions of contemporary people.

To correctly understand and handle the relationship between poetry and the lives of the people, poets must adopt an owner's attitude and deeply engage with the lives of the people, truly strengthening their sense of social responsibility and historical mission. Poetry is a literary form rich in contemporary significance and relevance, capable of quickly reflecting and expressing social life. It often expresses strong emotions, comments on reality, praises truth, goodness, and beauty, and criticizes falsehood, evil, and ugliness. It is a literary mechanism that greatly inspires and motivates the masses, playing a crucial role in transforming people's ideas, purifying their souls, and enhancing their ability to discern right from wrong and good from evil. Poetry, at any time, must not be detached from the times and the people.

However, in contemporary Chinese poetry circles, there are two poetic theories that directly hinder poets from engaging with the lives of the people. One is the belief that poetry has shifted from describing the "external world" to exploring the "internal world," that is, the grasp and expression of "life's anxieties within oneself." This is seen as a return to the essence of poetry and its development and progress. Another is the advocacy for the exploration and experimentation of "pure poetry" and "pure literature" in poetic creation, emphasizing the pursuit of poetic form, imbuing poetry with a strong aristocratic flavor. The former is derived from Freud's "unconscious" theory, which views literature and art as natural expressions of the "unconscious" that people are born with. Thus, as long as poets dare to "reveal themselves," "expand themselves," "dig into themselves," and display their "hidden world," allowing their "inner universe" to be savored and their "instincts and desires" to be vented and satisfied, they can write "good poetry." Since poetry is seen as the poet's "self-expression" and "subjective imagination," unrelated to the objective external world, poets naturally do not need to engage with the lives of the people outside themselves. The content of poetry is within the poet, making some poets distant from and above the reform tide. The latter, derived from the French poet Gautier's "art for art's sake," overlooks and denies the content of poetry, emphasizing the external form's uniqueness, beauty, and "transcendence," treating poetry as a "pure" art similar to a vase, advocating that the purpose of writing poetry is for appreciation and weaving a "purely formal network," pursuing "formal innovation," and viewing it as a spiritual activity that can be detached from content and devoid of any utilitarian purpose. Since poetic innovation lies in formal creation, without considering life and content, poets can naturally retreat into their ivory towers, bearing no social responsibilities, and need not engage with the reform and opening-up society, feeling the spirit of the times. Whether it is the "unconscious" theory or the "art for art's sake" advocacy, both contradict the Marxist principle that "literature is the active reflection of reality in the writer's mind," greatly distancing poetry from the people and the times. Their errors lie in their detachment from human social practice.

The Main Melody of Contemporary Poetry

Since reform is the main trend of contemporary Chinese society, it naturally should also be the main melody of Chinese poetry. We must actively support poets in reflecting the great cause of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, enthusiastically encouraging them to create poetry that is pioneering, innovative, and dedicated to the country and the people. We must clearly advocate for poets to use communist ideals, morality, and ethics to inspire, motivate, and educate the people, because our poetry is socialist poetry.

Poetry must adhere to the direction of "serving the people and serving socialism," taking the reflection and expression of reform and the Four Modernizations as its main melody. Only in this way can poetry strike the strongest chord of the times, unifying with the main trend of contemporary Chinese society and the real lives of contemporary people, advancing and soaring with the times.

However, in recent years, a theory has emerged in the Chinese poetry circles that "poetry has no purpose other than itself," stating that poetry is the "history of the soul" and the "music of the soul," and thus "disdains to convey messages" and "disdains to express achievements beyond oneself." It is said that if poetry's purpose and social function are acknowledged, it will hinder poetry's "purity," "universality," and "eternal value." Poetry cannot be detached from social life. Even if it writes about the "history of the soul" and the "music of the soul," this "history" and "music" must come from social life, because any "soul" is not "independent" or isolated from society, but has social, historical, and national attributes and connotations. Any person cannot be detached from the surroundings and impact of social life, because no one can lift themselves by their own hair and leave the earth. This theory and practice of "poetry for poetry's sake," advocating that "the value of poetry lies in poetry itself," not only causes poetry to lose its meaning and value but also leads poetry to extremes, entering a dead end.

Perhaps someone will say that the themes, subjects, and emotional scope of contemporary Chinese poetry are broad, and the forms, styles, schools, and techniques are diverse, already presenting a diversified situation. If we now advocate for poetry to take reform and the Four Modernizations as its main melody, will it lead to new uniformity and a single voice? It will not. The main melody we advocate today is not exclusive; it is not the "write the center" and "complete the task" of the "leftist" era that makes people nauseous. It is not about poets embellishing life or interpreting policies, returning to the old path, nor is it about poets pursuing utilitarianism and uniformity in poetic forms. Instead, it is a requirement for the multi-voice chorus of poetic creation to highlight the reform as the main melody. We highlight the reform as the main melody, not to exclude the multi-tones of poetry, but to let the poetry that embodies the main melody, together with the multi-component, multi-type, and diversified poetry, form a poetic chorus that is both resonant and harmonious, rich and powerful.

Both Exposure and Praise

Our poets should be objective and dialectical in their attitude towards Chinese social reality. They should stand on the heights of the times to observe and analyze the complex social phenomena of contemporary China. Our reforms have achieved tremendous success, bringing about profound and historical changes in China, with achievements being the main focus and attracting global attention. At the same time, problems and mistakes have also emerged. Our poets must not suppress one side and emphasize the other, seeing only problems and not achievements, only the minor and not the major. To use an imperfect analogy, it is like the sky having both clear and cloudy days, the moon having both full and waning phases, and numbers having both positive and negative values. Everything in the world is a unity of opposites, having both negative and positive aspects. Our reform cause is the same.

However, looking at our current poetry publications, poems that praise reform, celebrate new people, new things, and new customs, that is, poems that express positive, bright, and beautiful things, are very few, sometimes even non-existent in entire poetry journals (or entire poetry newspapers). What enters our vision is not the exposure of negative things, the display of filth and darkness, but the expression of personal values, personal life consciousness, or pathological emotions.

Of course, negative, dark, and ugly things are detestable and should be exposed, satirized, and criticized. This can brighten people's eyes and heighten their vigilance. Personal experiences and insights about society and life should also be expressed, which can resonate with people's emotions to some extent and provide beneficial enlightenment and philosophical reflection. I sincerely affirm and support these. The problem is that our poetry should not be satisfied with and confined to these. If it is only these, it will make people feel that the current state of affairs is too murky and dark, leading to the collapse of people's will and the loss of their spirit of progress and enterprise. Therefore, poetry should also have the task of singing the praises of light and progress, because positive and beautiful things still exist in large quantities in our lives.

    谈谈“改革与诗”
    张海宽
    “改革与诗”是个很有现实意义，很有文章可作的命题。通过对这个“命题”的研究和探讨，既可密切诗歌与改革的关系，加强诗歌的现实性和时代感，造成诗歌创作有利于“实现四化、振兴中华”的舆论和社会环境，又能促进诗歌在内容和形式上的发展变化，使诗歌能千姿百态地表现改革。要正确认识和处理“改革与诗”的关系，必须从理论和实践上解决改革是我国当代社会生活的主潮、当代生活的主潮应成为诗歌表现的主旋律和对生活既要暴露、更要赞颂这样几个问题。
    我国当代社会生活的主潮
    改革是我国社会发展中的又一次革命，使我国的社会主义社会和人们的精神风貌发生了极其深刻的历史性变化，已成为与全党、全国各族人民的命运和根本利益密切相关的伟大事业。作为当代社会一员、被称为具有敏感神经的诗人，不仅不会例外，而且更应该有改革意识和参与意识；积极、正确地认识和处理好“改革与诗”的关系。
    要积极、正确地认识和处理好“改革与诗”的关系，必须正确认识和处理诗歌与人民生活这种最基本、最重要的关系。人民生活是诗歌创作的源泉和母体，是诗歌的最高规范和赖以生存的深厚根基，唯有人民生活才能使诗歌真实和厚重起来；诗歌之花一旦离开人民生活这块土壤，就必然枯萎和凋零。我们的诗歌不仅是一个关系到我国经济发展后如何满足人民群众艺术享受的问题，而且是一个关系到用什么思想感情引导广大人民在“实现四化、振兴中华”的斗争中继续前进的问题。因此诗人要认真听取当代人民对诗歌的意见和要求，思考和研究改革开放中提出的新课题，以便使自己的诗歌能踏着时代节拍前进，成为有理想、有追求、有热情的诗歌。当然，诗歌在反映和表现人民生活上有其特殊方式和规律，它比别的文学样式更要求心灵化和主体意识的积极参与，是一种思想内容高度概括、形象密度最大、感情最强烈和语言最精粹的艺术。但诗歌却不是悬浮在空中的，更不是超离现实的“独立世界”，它总是同当代人的生活、社会和思想感情紧密地联系在一起的。
    要正确认识和处理诗歌与人民生活的关系，诗人必须以主人翁的姿态深入人民生活，真正加强社会责任感和时代使命感。诗歌是一种最富于时代感、现实性、能够比较迅速地反映和表现社会生活的文学样式。它经常以白热化的激情，抒发感慨，评论现实，歌颂真善美，鞭挞假恶丑，是一种对人民群众最有激发性和鼓动性的文学机制，在变革人们的思想观念、净化人们的灵魂和提高人们辨别是非美丑的能力上，具有潜移默化的重要作用。诗歌在任何时候，都不能脱离时代和人民。
    但是，在当代的我国诗坛上，有两种诗歌理论直接阻碍着诗人深入人民生活。一种是认为诗歌从对“外在世界”的抒写，进入对“内在世界”的开掘，即“对人自身的生命忧患”的把握和表现，是诗歌本体的回归，是诗的发展和进步。另一种是在诗歌创作上倡导对“纯诗”、“纯文学”的探索和实验，强调追求诗歌的形式因素，使诗歌染上一种浓重的贵族气。前者源于弗洛伊德的“潜意识”说，认为诗歌等文学艺术是人生下来就有的“潜意识”的自然表露。这样一来，只要诗人敢于“暴露自我”、“扩张自我”、“挖掘自我”、展示自我的“隐秘世界”，使自己的“内宇宙”得到吟味，使自己的“本能和欲望”得到宣泄和满足，就可写出“好诗”。既然诗歌是诗人的“自我表现”和“主观臆想”，与客观的外在世界无关，自然诗人也就没有必要去深入自身以外的人民生活了，因为诗歌的内容就在诗人本身，从而使有些诗人变成对改革大潮的远离者和超越者。后者源于法国诗人戈缔叶的“为艺术而艺术”，这种文学理论忽视、否定诗歌的内容，强调诗歌外在形式的奇特、华美和“超然”，把诗歌当成一种“纯粹”的、类似“花瓶”的艺术，主张写诗的目的在于赏玩，在于编织一种“纯形式的网络”，追求一种“形式上的花样翻新”，是一种可以无视内容，可以不带任何功利目的的精神活动。既然诗歌的创新就在于形式的创造，可不考虑生活和内容，那诗人自然就可钻入象牙之塔，不承担任何社会使命，也就不必深入改革开放的社会生活，感受时代精神了。不论是“潜意识”说，还是“为艺术而艺术”的主张，都违背了“文学是现实生活在作家
  头脑中能动地反映”这一马克思主义的基本原理，都大大拉开了诗歌与人民和时代的距离，它们的错误之处都在于脱离了人的社会实践。
    当代诗歌表现的主旋律
    改革既然是我国当代社会生活的主潮，理所当然地也应成为我国诗歌表现的主旋律。我们要积极支持诗人反映改革开放和社会主义现代化的伟大事业，热情鼓励诗人创作锐意进取、开拓创新、为国家为人民作奉献的诗歌，旗帜鲜明地倡导诗人用共产主义理想、道德和去熏陶、鼓舞和教育人民，因为我们的诗歌是社会主义诗歌。
    诗歌要坚持“为人民服务、为社会主义服务”的方向，就要把反映和表现改革和实现四化当作主旋律。只有这样，诗歌才能弹拨出时代的最强音，才能同我国当代社会的主潮流统一在一起，同当代人民群众的现实生活“热”在一起，与时代一起前进和腾飞。
    但是近几年来，在我国诗歌界却产生了一种“诗歌除自身而外别无目的”的理论，说诗歌是诗人“心灵的历史”、“心灵的音乐”，因而“不屑于载道”，“不屑于表现自我以外的丰功伟绩”，说如果承认“诗歌的目的性和社会功能”，就会妨碍诗歌的“纯粹”、“世界性”和“永恒价值”等。诗歌是不能离开社会生活的，即使写的是“心灵的历史”和“心灵的音乐”，这“历史”和“音乐”也必然来自社会生活，因为任何一个“心灵”都不是“独立”的、与世隔绝的，都会有社会的、历史的、民族的属性和内涵；任何一个人都不能脱离社会生活的包围和冲击，因为任何人都不能提着自己的头发离开地球。这种“为诗而诗”，主张“诗的价值就在于诗本身”的理论和实践，不仅使诗歌丧失了应有的意义和价值，而且使诗歌走向极端，进入死胡同。
    也许有人会说，当前我国诗歌的题材、主题和抒情幅度是宽广的，形式、风格、流派和手法是多样的，已呈现多样化的态势，如果现在提倡诗歌以改革和实现四化为主旋律，是不是又会出现新的单一化和一种声音呢？不会的。我们今天所提倡的主旋律不是排他的，不是“左”风盛行年代里那种令人倒胃口的“写中心”和“赶任务”，不是要诗人粉饰生活、图解政策，回到过去的老路上去，更不是要诗人搞急功近利的实用主义，追求诗歌形态的划一，而是要求在诗歌创作的多声部大合唱中，突出改革这个主旋律；我们突出改革这个主旋律不仅不排斥诗歌的多声调，而且是要让体现主旋律的诗歌与多成分、多类型、多样化的诗歌组成一支既主调响亮、鲜明，又多声调和鸣、互补、浑厚的诗歌大合唱。
    既要暴露，更要赞美
    我们的诗人应该实事求是、一分为二地对待我国的社会现实，应该站在时代的制高点上来观察、分析当前我国纷繁复杂的社会现象，因为我国的改革取得了巨大成就，使我国发生了深刻的、历史性变化，成绩是主要的，举世瞩目的，同时也出现了问题和失误。我们的诗人决不能抑此扬彼，只见问题，不见成绩，只看支流，不看主流。打个不太恰当的比喻，这如同天有晴和阴、月有圆和缺、数有正和负一样，世界上的一切事物都是对立的统一，都是不仅有反面，而且有正面的。我们的改革事业也是如此。
    可是，打开我们当前的诗歌报刊看看，歌颂改革，赞美新人、新事和新风尚的诗歌，即表现积极、光明、美好事物的诗歌却很少很少，有时整本诗歌刊物（或整张诗报）几乎一首没有，进入我们视野的，不是对反面事物的揭露，对污秽灰暗事物的展示，就是对自我价值或个人生命意识、或病态感情的抒写。
    当然，消极、阴暗、丑恶的事物是令人痛恨的，应该揭露、讽刺和抨击，这能擦亮人们的眼睛，提高人们的警觉；个人对社会人生的种种体验和领悟，也应该宣泄，这也能在一定范围内与人们的感情相通，给人们以有益的启迪和哲理思考。这些，我是由衷地肯定和赞成的。问题是我们的诗歌不能仅仅满足于这些，囿于这些。如果只有这些，就会使人们感到当今的世态太浑浊、太阴暗，从而造成人们意志的沦丧，奋发、进取精神的失落。因此，诗歌还应该有讴歌光明和进步的任务，因为我们生活中积极、美好的事物仍是大量存在的。
