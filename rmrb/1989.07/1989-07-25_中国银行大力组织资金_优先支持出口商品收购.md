Today, the Bank of China's branch managers' meeting began in Beijing. It was revealed that currently, nearly 10,000 foreign-invested enterprises have business relationships with the Bank of China. Among these, over 3,000 enterprises have been developed with the support of loans from the Bank of China. This year, the Bank of China has supported 139 fixed asset loan projects for foreign-invested enterprises, accounting for 45% of the newly approved fixed asset loan projects; it has supported 436 working capital loan projects for foreign-invested enterprises, accounting for 36% of the working capital loan projects.

To prevent a decline in exports, the Bank of China, adhering to the principle of supporting whoever exports, has reduced loans to non-export enterprises and other unreasonable fund occupations. By the end of June this year, the outstanding balance of working capital loans for import and export enterprises was 11.0728 billion yuan, an increase of 655.5 million yuan compared to the same period last year, effectively supporting the foreign trade sector in implementing the first half-year import and export plan.

Wang Deye, the bank president, proposed at the meeting that efforts should be made to organize fund sources, eliminate the inferior and support the superior, and prioritize support for the procurement of key export commodities within the state plan and marketable commodities. Support should be given to enterprises with good economic benefits and repayment capabilities. New foreign exchange loans should be strictly controlled, export collections should be accelerated, and foreign payments should be guaranteed.

    中国银行大力组织资金
    优先支持出口商品收购
    本报北京7月25日讯　记者计泓赓报道：今天起在此间举行的中国银行分行行长座谈会透露：目前与中国银行有业务关系的外商投资企业，已达近万家。其中3000多家是中国银行用贷款支持发展起来的。今年以来中国银行共支持外商投资企业固定资产贷款项目139项，占新批固定资产贷款项目的45％；支持外商流动资金贷款项目436个，占流动资金贷款项目的36％。
    为了不使出口滑坡，中国银行本着谁出口就支持谁的原则，压缩了非出口企业的贷款和其他不合理资金占用。至今年6月底，进出口企业的流动资金贷款余额为1107.28亿元人民币，比去年同期增加65.55亿元，有力地支持了外贸部门执行上半年进出口计划。
    王德衍行长在会上提出，要大力组织资金来源，限劣扶优，优先支持国家计划内重点出口商品和适销对路商品的收购，支持经济效益好，有还贷能力的企业。要严格控制新批外汇贷款，加速出口收汇，保证对外支付。
