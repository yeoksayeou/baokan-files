On the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," recalling the artists who lived in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region and various revolutionary base areas at that time, they followed the spirit of the "Talks," guided by the direction of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. They went deep into the countryside, the army, and the factories, drawing rich and diverse sources of creation from the lives of the people, using artistic forms that the masses liked and enjoyed, creating a large number of excellent works that reflected real life. These works played an active role in the political, economic, and cultural construction of the revolutionary base areas at that time and were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people. These works were not only welcomed by the people in the liberated areas but also by the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and foreign friends, adding a glorious chapter to the history of modern Chinese literature and art.

After the founding of New China, we literary and art workers continued to implement the direction indicated by the "Talks." In this new historical period, a large number of outstanding young literary and art workers emerged again, achieving new great achievements.

However, in recent years, the situation has changed. The direction of the "Talks" is not valued, and some people even think that the "Talks" are outdated and no longer suitable for today's needs. They criticize those who insist on creating works in the spirit of the "Talks" as "old-fashioned," "dogmatic," and so on.

I do not agree with the so-called "outdated" view. Comrade Mao Zedong proposed in the "Talks" that the fundamental direction of literature and art is to serve the broadest masses of the people, primarily the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and also discussed how literature and art should serve them. It was very comprehensive. After the founding of the country, facing new situations and new tasks, the Party proposed the policy of literature and art serving the people and serving socialism. This is the continuation and development of the spirit of the "Talks" in the new historical period. Because today, the workers, peasants, and soldiers are still the main body of our country, accounting for the vast majority of the people, and are the main force relying on socialist construction. Literature and art should naturally serve them. On October 30, 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, on behalf of the Party Central Committee, said in his congratulatory speech at the Fourth National Congress of Chinese Literary and Art Workers: "We will continue to adhere to the direction proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong that literature and art should serve the broadest masses of the people, primarily the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Comrade Deng Xiaoping's congratulatory speech is very important and timely, indicating that the spirit of the "Talks" has not become outdated. The workers, peasants, and soldiers are on the front line of building socialism and national defense, creating and defending the material wealth of our country, and are also the pioneers of culture and art. We literary and art workers should dedicate our best works to them. This is our duty. Not only in the revolutionary war years should it be like this, but also in today's literature and art and in the future literature and art should it be like this. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Speech" is an important document that inherits and develops Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks." In the "Speech," there are two sentences: "The people need art, and art needs the people more;" "The people are the mother of literary and art workers." How concisely it summarizes the close relationship between literature and art and the people!

Literature and art should serve the people and serve socialism. The author must be familiar with the lives of the people and must go deep into the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. If one does not approach them and does not understand them, creation will lose its source and will not be able to create good works. Of course, the literature and art works that reflect are not only directly depicting the lives of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. For example, in the field of fine arts, landscape paintings, flower and bird paintings, and various decorative arts, they can give people aesthetic enjoyment and enrich people's spiritual life, which is also serving the people. The creators of these artworks must also approach the people, understand the people, and blend their feelings with the people's aesthetic tastes to create works that the people will welcome.

Literature and art should serve the people and must adopt artistic forms that the people can understand and accept. The times are developing, and the people's appreciation level is also improving day by day. People of different ages, different occupations, and different cultural backgrounds have different appreciation levels and different interests. Therefore, artistic forms should be diverse, continuously developing, continuously improving, and innovating. However, whether it is improvement or innovation, it must be combined with the people and cannot be separated from the people. Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks" on the relationship between improvement and popularization, and how to innovate, are all discussed very clearly. He pointed out: "Our improvement is based on popularization; our popularization is under the guidance of improvement." This sentence is still very appropriate today.

However, in recent years, some fine art workers have not started from our national conditions, have not cared about the aesthetic tastes of the Chinese people, and have blindly accepted foreign modernist art, copying their artistic techniques. The works they produce are incomprehensible to people; some, even if they can see a bit of meaning, are absurd and bizarre, or depict scenes of loneliness, emptiness, despair, confusion, depression, and madness. Some people pile up some old and discarded objects and garbage and also call it art, taking ugliness as beauty. This kind of work, I saw a few years ago in some exhibition halls in capitalist countries in Europe, with few visitors, they coldly walked past the exhibits. I asked an author to explain the meaning of the exhibit, and he said, "It's better not to ask, art is about being strange." At that time, I thought, don't let these strange things infect China. Unexpectedly, not long after, they indeed appeared in the exhibition halls of the China Art Museum in Beijing. After seeing this kind of work, I felt very sad. In fact, these things have been appearing on the European art scene since the late 19th century, and later they became more and more bizarre. It is a product of the capitalist system in its later stages, reflecting the worldview and artistic view of the bourgeoisie. By now, it is no longer a new thing. We should adopt a research and analysis attitude towards it. In our China, the situation is completely different from theirs. Our country is in a new historical period of building socialism, and the people need high-quality spiritual food. We literary and art workers should make contributions to this great cause. I ask, displaying these monstrous things, what good can they bring to people's spirits? What role can they play in society? They say this is "innovation," but in fact, foreigners have long had it, and some have been discarded, but today some of our people pick it up as a treasure. Is this also called innovation? No, this is not innovation, but a regression! What I cannot understand is why some of our newspapers and magazines publish these things in large quantities and propagandize these bourgeois idealist artistic views? I think the leadership departments in charge of our country's literary and art work should be responsible for these phenomena that deviate from the interests of the people and violate the Party's literary and art direction.

Today, it has been 45 years since the publication of Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks." In the past 45 years, the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, have defeated powerful enemies at home and abroad, established New China. Although we have achieved great achievements in carrying out socialist revolution and socialist construction, due to various interferences in the middle, especially the destruction of the ten-year "Cultural Revolution," the setbacks are heavy. However, determined revolutionaries should regard setbacks as lessons, should be more sober-minded, and should not lose confidence. Now, it is so important to re-study the "Talks" and continue to insist on and develop the spirit of the "Talks"! I have been engaged in artistic work for nearly half a century. If I have achieved some success, it is due to the nurturing of the people, the cultivation of the Party, and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. I will continue to follow the direction indicated by the Party and strive unremittingly.

    坚持文艺的“二为”方向
    古元
    在纪念毛泽东同志《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表45周年的时候，回想起当时生活在陕甘宁边区和各革命根据地的艺术工作者，他们遵照《讲话》的精神，在文艺为工农兵服务方向的指引下，纷纷深入农村、部队、工厂中去，从人民群众生活中获得丰富多采的创作源泉，运用群众喜闻乐见的艺术形式，创作出大批反映现实生活的优秀作品，对当时革命根据地的政治、经济和文化建设都起到了积极的作用，受到了广大人民群众的热烈欢迎。这些作品，不仅受到解放区人民的欢迎，而且受到国统区人民和国外朋友们的欢迎，为中国现代文艺史写下了光辉的篇章。
    新中国成立后，我们文艺工作者继续贯彻《讲话》所指引的方向，在新的历史时期，又涌现出大批优秀的青年文艺工作者，取得了新的伟大成绩。
    但是近几年来，情况有所改变，《讲话》的方向不被重视，甚至有些人认为《讲话》已经过时，不适合今天的需要了。他们对于坚持《讲话》精神进行创作的同志们指责为“老一套”、“教条”……等。
    我不同意所谓“过时”的观点。毛泽东同志在《讲话》中作为根本方向提出来的就是文艺要为最广大的人民群众、首先为工农兵服务的方向，同时，也讲到文艺如何为他们服务的问题。讲得很全面。建国以后，面对新的形势和新的任务，党又提出文艺为人民服务，为社会主义服务的方针。这是《讲话》精神在新的历史时期的继续和发展。因为在今天，工农兵群众仍然是我们国家的主体，占全体人民的绝大多数，是社会主义建设所依靠的最主要力量，文艺当然应该为他们服务。1979年10月30日，邓小平同志代表党中央在中国文学艺术工作者第四次代表大会祝辞上指出：“我们要继续坚持毛泽东同志提出的文艺为最广大的人民群众、首先为工农兵服务的方向。”邓小平同志的祝辞是十分重要的，非常适时的，说明《讲话》的精神没有过时，工农兵群众生活在建设社会主义和国防的第一线，是我们国家物质财富的创造者和保卫者，也是文化艺术的开拓者，我们文艺工作者应该把最好的作品奉献给他们，这是我们的职责。不仅在革命战争年代应该这样，现在的文艺和将来的文艺都应该这样。邓小平同志的《祝辞》是继承和发展了毛泽东同志《讲话》的重要文献，《祝辞》中有两句话：“人民需要艺术，艺术更需要人民”；“人民，是文艺工作者的母亲。”多么精辟地概括了文艺与人民的密切关系！
    文艺要为人民服务，为社会主义服务，作者就必须熟悉人民群众的生活，必须深入到工农兵生活中去，如果不去接近他们，不理解他们，创作就失去了源泉，就创作不出好的作品。当然，文艺作品所反映的不仅是直接表现工农兵群众的生活，比如美术方面的风景画、花鸟画和各种装饰艺术等，它能给人以美的欣赏，丰富人们的精神生活，也是为人民服务。创作这些艺术品的作者，也要去接近群众，理解群众，和他们的感情交融，和他们的审美情趣相通，才可能创作出为他们欢迎的好作品。
    文艺要为人民服务，就必须采用人民群众能够理解和接受的艺术形式，时代在发展，群众的欣赏水平也日益提高，不同年龄，不同职业，不同文化程度的群众，有不同的欣赏水平与不同的兴趣。因此，艺术形式要多样，要不断地发展，不断地提高和创新。但是，提高也好，创新也好，都要和人民群众相结合，不能脱离群众。毛泽东同志《讲话》中关于提高与普及的关系，如何创新的问题，都论述得非常清楚。他明确指出：“我们的提高，是在普及的基础上提高；我们的普及，是在提高指导下的普及。”这句话对于今天还是很适合的。
    然而，近几年来，有少数美术工作者，他们不从我们的国情出发，不顾我国人民的审美情趣，盲目接受外国的现代派艺术，照搬他们的艺术手法，搞出来的作品人们看不懂；有些即使能看出点名堂，但内容荒诞离奇，或者描绘一些孤独、空虚、苦闷、彷徨、颓丧、狂乱的情景。还有人把一些破旧实物和垃圾堆积在一起，也称之为艺术，以丑为美。这类作品，前几年我在欧洲资本主义国家的一些展览场所里看见过，参观的人寥寥无几，他们冷淡地在展品前一走而过，我问一位作者，请他解释一下展品的含意，他说：“不问为好，艺术就是出奇。”当时我就想，可别让这些出奇的东西传染到中国去，不料，没过多久，在我们北京的中国美术馆的展厅里果然出现了，我见到这类作品后，心里很难过。其实，这些东西早在19世纪后期就在欧洲画坛上开始出现了，往后越搞越离奇，它是在资本主义制度发展到后期的产物，它反映了资产阶级的世界观和艺术观，到了现在它已经不是什么新鲜的东西了，我们对它应采取研究和分析的态度。在我们中国，情况与他们根本不同，我们国家正处在一个建设社会主义的新的历史时期，人民群众需要的是高尚的精神食粮，我们文艺工作者应该为这个伟大事业做出贡献，试问，把这些丑怪的东西展示出来，它能给人们精神上带来什么好处？对社会又起到什么样的作用呢？他们说这是“创新”，其实外国早已有之，有些已经被抛弃掉了，但今天我们某些人却捡来当作珍宝，难道这也算是创新吗？不，这绝不是创新，而是一种倒退！更使我不能理解的，为什么我国有些报刊，却大量发表这些东西，大肆宣扬这些资产阶级的唯心主义的艺术观呢？我认为主管我国文艺工作的领导部门，对于这种背离人民利益、违背党的文艺方向的种种现象，是要负责任的。
    今天，毛泽东同志《讲话》发表已45周年了。45年来，中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，打败了国内外强大的敌人，建立了新中国。虽然在进行社会主义革命和社会主义建设中取得了伟大的成就，但由于中间受到了种种干扰，尤其遭受十年“文化大革命”的破坏，挫折是深重的。但是，坚定的革命者应当把挫折作为教训，应当更加清醒，不能失去信心。现在重新学习《讲话》，继续坚持和发展《讲话》的精神，仍是多么的重要啊！我从事艺术工作将近半个世纪了，如果说有了一点成绩的话，那是由于人民的哺育，党的培养，马列主义和毛泽东思想的教导。我将继续遵循党所指引的方向，努力不息。
