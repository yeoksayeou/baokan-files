The most notable aspect of the current development in East-West relations is the visits by Gorbachev to France and Bush to Poland and Hungary within this month. If Gorbachev's visit to the Federal Republic of Germany is also included, the two leaders of the Warsaw Pact and NATO have each visited the other's allied countries within a month.

Whether by coincidence or deliberate arrangement, the tone of their visits has been remarkably similar. During his visit to Western Europe, Gorbachev emphasized the idea of a "Europe from the Atlantic to the Urals." Bush, on the other hand, declared in Eastern Europe that the "genuine opportunity" for a "unified, open, and free Europe" has arrived. In short, both are drawing up blueprints for how to eliminate the "artificial division" between East and West Europe.

Gorbachev's basic concept of the "European House" can be summarized in the following five points:

1. Strengthening cooperation among the countries within the house in political, economic, technological, and cultural aspects.
2. Countries and blocs should not resort to force, and mutual respect for sovereignty and security should be maintained.
3. Replacing the deterrence strategy with the "theory of restraint." Both sides should abandon the idea of seeking military superiority and continue the "strong process of disarmament."
4. Each country has the right to freely choose its social system.
5. The United States and Canada will also have their places in this house.

Gorbachev believes that achieving these five points will allow the European House to rise from the ground.

Bush's vision for Europe's future is not as optimistic as Gorbachev's. According to reports, to promote and encourage the "historical process" of East-West reconciliation, his policy intentions are as follows:

1. Expanding American influence in Eastern Europe. Before visiting Poland and Hungary, he stated that the Eastern European issue should be one of the "key issues" at the Paris summit of the seven major powers and a topic for discussion. Western public opinion believes that this actually means that the "advance into Eastern Europe" has become a key point in U.S. strategy.
2. Differentiated treatment. He praised the "democratic reforms" and "opening to the West" in Poland and Hungary, and provided appropriate economic benefits, while criticizing and imposing economic sanctions on those he deemed insufficient in reform and opening up or opposing forces.
3. Cautious approach. For Poland and Hungary, Bush only promised "limited aid" during his visit. He repeatedly emphasized the need for the people of these two countries to tighten their belts and make greater sacrifices.
4. Acknowledging the "special relationship" between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

From this, it can be seen that although the Soviet Union and the United States agree on building a "prosperous, peaceful, and free Europe," they have different plans for how to build this house. In his speech in Strasbourg, Gorbachev advocated for all foreign troops to return to their home countries and proposed that if NATO agrees to negotiate on short-range missiles, the Soviet Union will unilaterally reduce such weapons. The purpose is to drive a wedge between U.S.-European common defense and expand the debate within NATO on short-range missiles. Bush's open encouragement of peaceful evolution towards the West in Poland and Hungary also clearly indicates that they both want to build this house by undermining each other's foundations.

However, both the United States and the Soviet Union have their own concerns. One acknowledges the position of the United States in the European House; the other acknowledges Soviet control over Eastern Europe. It is clear that these two superpowers want to change the European situation since the Cold War but do not want to completely abandon it.

Currently, Europe is at the focal point of East-West dialogue and struggle. Since last year, there has been a clear trend in East and West Europe to reduce the control of the two superpowers and to approach each other politically and economically, strengthening exchanges. Meanwhile, Gorbachev's frequent diplomatic offensives towards the West have almost all targeted Europe. After Bush took office, he adjusted NATO's strategy with a "new concept," mended internal divisions, and responded to Soviet challenges. Their attention is focused on this ancient continent. Therefore, it can be predicted that in the next few years, the United States, the Soviet Union, and the countries of East and West Europe will engage in frequent dialogues and intense struggles around the "European House."

    围绕“欧洲大厦”的对话与争夺
    ——评苏美首脑相继访欧
    本报记者　魏崴
    当前，东西方关系发展中最令人瞩目的，是本月内戈尔巴乔夫访问法国和布什访问波兰和匈牙利。如果把戈氏的联邦德国之行也算进来的话，华约和北约的这两位盟主在1个月的时间内，分别跑到对方盟国转了一遭。
    是巧合也好，刻意安排也好，他们访问的基调，有异曲同工之妙。戈氏访西欧时，大谈“从大西洋到乌拉尔山的欧洲”；布什则在东欧声称建立“一个开放、统一和自由的欧洲”的“真正机会”业已到来。总之，他俩都在为如何消除东西欧“人为的分裂”状态，绘制蓝图。
    戈尔巴乔夫的“欧洲大厦”的基本构想，可归纳为下列5点：1、处于大厦内的各国在政治、经济、科技、文化诸方面加强合作；2、国与国、集团同集团之间不应诉诸武力，各国应相互尊重主权的完整和安全；3、以“克制理论”取代威慑战略。双方都要摒弃争夺军事优势的打算，不断深化“强有力的裁军进程”；4、每个国家均享有自由选择它的社会制度的权利；5、美国和加拿大在这个大厦中“也将有它们的位置”。戈尔巴乔夫认为，做到上述5点，欧洲大厦便可拔地而起。
    布什对欧洲未来的憧憬，不像戈氏那样乐观。据报道，为了推动和鼓励东西欧和解的“历史进程”，他的政策意向如下：1、扩大美国在东欧的影响。在访问波、匈前夕，他表示要把东欧问题当作巴黎7国首脑会议的“关键问题之一”和与会者磋商。西方舆论认为，这实际上意味着向“东欧突进”已成为美国战略的重点；2、区别对待。对波、匈两国的“民主改革”和“向西方开放”大加赞扬，且适当地给予经济实惠，对他认为改革和开放不力的或反对者则予以谴责和加以经济制裁；3、谨慎从事。对于波兰和匈牙利，布什在访问中也仅仅许下“有限的援助”。他反复强调的，是希望这两国人民勒紧裤带，作出更大牺牲；4、承认苏联和东欧国家间存在着“特殊关系”。
    由此看来，苏美虽在建设一个“繁荣、和平、自由的欧洲”上相互认同，但在如何建设这个大厦上，则各有各的打算。戈尔巴乔夫在斯特拉斯堡的讲话中，主张一切外国军队撤回本土去，并且提出北约如果同意谈判短导问题，苏联即可单方面裁减这种武器。其目的在于离间美欧共同防务，扩大北约内部关于短导的争论。布什在波兰和匈牙利公开鼓励向西方靠拢的和平演变，亦明白无误地说明，他们都想通过互挖对方墙脚来盖这座大厦。
    不过，美苏双方又各有所顾虑。一个承认美国在欧洲大厦内的位置；一个承认苏联对东欧的控制。可见，这两个超级大国既想改变冷战以来的欧洲格局，又不想完全摆脱它。
    目前，欧洲正处在东西方对话和争夺的焦点。自从去年以来，东西欧出现了想减弱两个超级大国对自己控制的明显势头，在政治和经济上相互接近，加强往来。与此同时，戈尔巴乔夫向西方频频发起的外交攻势，其目标几乎全是针对欧洲。布什执政后，即以“新观念”调整北约战略，弥合内部分歧和应付苏联的挑战。他们的注意力都集中在这个古老的大陆上。因此，可以预测，在今后若干年之内，美国、苏联以及东西欧各国，将会围绕着“欧洲大厦”，进行频繁的对话和激烈的争夺。
