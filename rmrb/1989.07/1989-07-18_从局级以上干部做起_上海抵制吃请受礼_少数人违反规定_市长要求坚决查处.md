Shanghai Municipal Supervision Bureau's latest statistics show that since the Shanghai Municipal Government issued eight regulations on the frugal and hardworking style of work for bureau-level and above leading cadres a year ago, these cadres have consciously resisted accepting invitations and gifts, with the vast majority complying with the eight regulations. However, the trend of accepting invitations and gifts has not stopped, and some leaders still accept invitations and gifts without hesitation.

"Officials do not fear my strictness but my integrity; the people do not submit to my abilities but my fairness. Fairness brings clarity, and integrity brings authority." Shanghai Mayor Zhu Rongji once quoted these ancient words to remind leading cadres to set an example by being clean and incorruptible, and to start with himself. He also required the Municipal Supervision Bureau to closely monitor all bureau-level and above cadres in the municipal government, and to firmly investigate and deal with any violations of the regulations.

The eight regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Government stipulate that bureau-level cadres, when dining at the grassroots level, must eat local food, not exceeding one dish and one soup, and pay according to the regulations; when participating in ceremonial activities and meetings, they must not accept gifts; they must not accept samples and gifts under the pretext of trial use or appraisal; when the municipal government holds meetings, no gifts or gift certificates may be given to attendees under any name; for gifts that are difficult to refuse, they can be accepted and then handed over to the unit for unified handling. The eight regulations also point out that for those who violate these regulations, the first offense will result in a written reprimand, the second offense will result in a public criticism, and the third offense will result in administrative sanctions. Serious and harmful issues will be investigated and dealt with by the Municipal Supervision Bureau.

Since the implementation of the eight regulations, the supervision departments of Shanghai have strengthened the supervision of all bureau-level and above cadres in the municipal government regarding accepting invitations and gifts. So far, 12 cases of bureau-level cadres violating the eight regulations have been discovered, involving 26 bureau-level cadres. Among them, one person was publicly criticized, 10 people returned 16 gifts after receiving the supervision letter, and 17 people paid the meal fees after receiving the supervision letter. The vast majority of bureau-level cadres have complied with the eight regulations.

The recent survey results of over 44,000 government officials by the Shanghai Municipal Supervision Bureau also reflect some worrying situations. For example, among bureau-level cadres, some accept banquets during cadre transfers, and some use work exchanges for eating and drinking. During the trial operation opening of the Shanghai Far East Hotel, the per capita banquet standard was as high as 86 yuan, and 13 bureau-level cadres still attended without hesitation.

    从局级以上干部做起
    上海抵制吃请受礼
    少数人违反规定　市长要求坚决查处
    本报上海7月18日电　记者刘士安报道：上海市监察局最新统计表明，自一年前上海市政府作出了政府机关局级以上领导干部发扬艰苦朴素作风的8条规定以来，局级以上领导干部自觉抵制吃请受礼已见成效，绝大多数都做到了规定的8条，但是吃请送礼风仍止不住，少数领导依然吃请不误礼品照收。
    “吏不畏我严，而畏我廉；民不服我能，而服我公。公则明，廉则威。”上海市市长朱熔基曾引用这句古人的话，告诫领导干部以身作则，做到一尘不染、两袖清风，并表示要“从我做起”，他还要求市监察局把眼睛牢牢盯住全市政府机关局级以上干部，发现有违反规定的要坚决查处。
    上海市政府的8条规定中，要求局级干部在基层就餐时，一律吃客饭，不超过一菜一汤，并按规定付费；参加礼仪活动和会议时，不得收受礼品；不得以试用、鉴定等名义收受样品和礼品；市政府机关召开会议，不得以任何名义向与会者赠送礼品和礼券；对难于拒收的礼品，可在收下后交本单位统一处理。8条规定中还指出，对违反本规定者，第一次书面检查，第二次通报批评，第三次给予行政处分。对性质严重、影响很坏的突出问题由市监察局进行查处。
    实施8条规定以来，上海市监察部门加强了对全市政府机关局级以上干部在吃请受礼方面的监督，到目前为止，已发现局级干部违反8条规定的共12起，涉及26名局级干部，其中有1人被通报批评，10人在收到监察书后退交了16件礼品，17人收到监察书后补交了餐费。绝大多数局级干部都做到了按8条规定办事。
    上海市监察局最近对4.4万多名政府机关工作人员的调查结果，还反映出一些令人不安的情况，如在局级干部中，有的乘干部调动之际接受宴请，有的借工作交往搞吃喝。上海远洋宾馆试营业开张时，人均宴请标准高达86元，竟有13名局级干部照吃不误。
