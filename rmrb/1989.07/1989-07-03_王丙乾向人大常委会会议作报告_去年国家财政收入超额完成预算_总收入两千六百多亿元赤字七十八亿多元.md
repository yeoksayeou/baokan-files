Wang Bingqian, Vice Premier and Minister of Finance, today, on behalf of the State Council, reported to the eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress on the 1988 national budget execution. He said that in 1988, China's socialist modernization construction continued to advance, economic system reform deepened, the national economy sustained growth, and various social undertakings made new progress. On this basis, through the joint efforts of governments at all levels and relevant departments, the fiscal revenue exceeded the state budget, and the fiscal expenditure structure was adjusted. From the supply and allocation of funds, it basically guaranteed the needs of reform, construction, and the development of undertakings. According to the officially compiled 1988 national budget execution, the total revenue was 2628.02 billion yuan, and the total expenditure was 2706.57 billion yuan. After deducting the revenue and expenditure, the fiscal deficit was 78.55 billion yuan. Compared with the estimated execution figures reported to the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress, the total fiscal revenue increased by 40.2 billion yuan, the total fiscal expenditure increased by 38.26 billion yuan, and the fiscal deficit decreased by 1.94 billion yuan.

He said that in the total revenue of the 1988 national budget execution, domestic fiscal revenue was 2489.41 billion yuan, completing 102.6% of the budget; foreign loan revenue was 138.61 billion yuan, completing 108.3% of the budget.

Wang Bingqian said that the 1988 national fiscal revenue was able to exceed the budget mainly due to the continuous growth of social production and the further expansion of social commodity circulation. This year, the gross national product increased by 11.2% compared to the previous year, national income increased by 11.4% compared to the previous year, the total retail sales of social commodities, after deducting the factor of price increases, increased by 7.9% compared to the previous year, and the total import and export volume of foreign trade increased by 20.6% compared to the previous year. On the basis of production development and circulation expansion, various regions and departments did a lot of work in organizing revenue and strengthening management, and fiscal revenue increased accordingly. This year, domestic fiscal revenue increased by 226.99 billion yuan compared to the previous year, an increase of 10%. After deducting non-comparable factors, the increase was 8.3%. In addition, the 1988 national fiscal revenue was able to exceed the budget, which is also inseparable from further promoting the reform of the fiscal management system and carrying out tax, financial, and price inspections.

He also said that the allocation and use of national fiscal expenditure in 1988 were basically normal. This year, according to the needs of economic development and reform, the expenditure structure was appropriately adjusted, and key expenditure items such as energy transportation, agriculture, and education increased significantly, while other aspects of expenditure were controlled, and the efficiency of fund use also improved.

Wang Bingqian pointed out that there were also some problems that could not be ignored in the execution of the 1988 national budget. At the second session of the Seventh National People's Congress held in March this year, many representatives were very concerned about fiscal issues and raised many critical opinions, which were very pertinent. We believe that the following problems deserve our high attention and need to be improved in future work.

1. In the future, whether it is the central fiscal revenue or the local fiscal revenue, we must take decisive measures through rectification, rectification, and deepening of reform to gradually eliminate the deficit and achieve a balanced budget.
2. We must truly shift the focus of economic work to the track of improving economic efficiency as the center, and through deepening reform, establish and improve the internal operation mechanism of enterprises, strengthen enterprise management, strictly implement the economic accounting system, gradually improve enterprise economic efficiency, increase effective supply, and increase fiscal revenue.
3. Whether from the current or long-term development needs, the proportion of national fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue should be appropriately increased. Starting from this year, measures should be taken to appropriately concentrate funds and gradually move in this direction.
4. We must adhere to the policy of hard work and frugal construction, strengthen fiscal legal construction, strengthen budget and financial management, and improve the quality of fiscal, tax, financial, and accounting personnel, so that the level of fiscal management will have a significant improvement.

    王丙乾向人大常委会会议作报告
    去年国家财政收入超额完成预算
    总收入两千六百多亿元赤字七十八亿多元
    新华社北京7月3日电　国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾今天受国务院委托向七届全国人大常委会第八次会议作关于1988年国家决算的报告时说，1988年，我国社会主义现代化建设事业继续向前发展，经济体制改革逐步深入，国民经济持续增长，各项社会事业有了新的进展，并着手进行治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序工作。在这个基础上，经过各级人民政府和有关部门的共同努力，财政收入超额完成了国家预算，财政支出结构有所调整，从资金供应和分配上基本保证了改革、建设和事业发展的需要。根据正式编成的1988年国家决算，总收入为2628.02亿元，总支出为2706.57亿元，收入和支出相抵，财政赤字为78.55亿元。同我们上次向第七届全国人民代表大会第二次会议报告的预计执行数比较，财政总收入增加40.2亿元，财政总支出增加38.26亿元，财政赤字减少1.94亿元。
    他说，在1988年国家决算总收入中，国内财政收入为2489.41亿元，完成预算的102.6％；国外借款收入138.61亿元，完成预算的108.3％。
    王丙乾说，1988年国家财政收入能够超额完成预算，首先是由于社会生产持续增长和社会商品流通进一步扩大。这一年，国民生产总值比上年增长11.2％，国民收入比上年增长11.4％，社会商品零售总额扣除物价上涨因素，比上年增长7.9％，外贸进出口总额比上年增长20.6％。在生产发展和流通扩大的基础上，各地区、各部门在组织收入、加强管理等方面做了大量的工作，财政收入有了相应增加。这一年，国内财政收入比上年增加226.99亿元，增长10％，扣除不可比因素计算，则增长8.3％。此外，1988年国家财政收入能够超额完成预算，同进一步推进财政管理体制改革，开展税收、财务、物价大检查，也是分不开的。
    他还说，1988年国家财政支出的分配和使用情况，基本上是正常的。这一年，根据经济发展和改革的需要，支出的结构作了适当调整，能源交通、农业和教育等重点支出项目增加较多，其他方面的支出有所控制，资金的使用效益也有所提高。
    王丙乾指出，1988年国家预算执行中，也存在一些不容忽视的问题。在今年3月召开的七届全国人大二次会议上，许多代表对财政问题非常关心，提出了不少批评意见，这些意见都是很中肯的。我们认为，有以下几个问题值得我们高度重视，并在今后的工作中加以改进。
  （一）今后不论中央财政和地方财政，都应当通过治理、整顿和深化改革，采取坚决的措施，逐步消除赤字，做到收支平衡。（二）一定要把经济工作的重点真正转移到以提高经济效益为中心的轨道上来，并通过深化改革，建立和完善企业内部经营机制，强化企业管理，严格经济核算制度，使企业经济效益逐步提高，从而增加有效供给，增加财政收入。（三）无论从当前还是从长远发展的需要来看，国家财政收入占国民收入的比重和中央财政收入占全国财政收入的比重，都应适当提高。从今年开始，就要采取措施，适当集中资金，朝着这个方向逐步前进。（四）一定要坚持艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的方针，加强财政法制建设，强化预算和财务管理，并提高财政、税收、财务、会计人员素质，使财政管理水平有一个明显的提高。
