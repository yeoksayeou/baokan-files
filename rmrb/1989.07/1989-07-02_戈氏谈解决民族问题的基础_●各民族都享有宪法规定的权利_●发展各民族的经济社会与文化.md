Gorbachev Discusses the Foundations for Solving the Nationality Issue
* All nationalities enjoy the rights stipulated by the constitution
* Develop the economy, society, and culture of all nationalities

People's Daily, Berlin, July 2nd, Correspondent Hu Hongzhi reports: Soviet Communist Party Central Committee General Secretary and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, Gorbachev, called on the peoples of all nationalities in the Soviet Union to strive to solve problems related to national relations on the basis of friendship and cooperation.

On July 1st, Gorbachev made this call in a televised and broadcast address to the nation on the issue of national relations. The Central Television and Radio of the Soviet Union simultaneously broadcast this important speech. In his speech, he discussed the importance of correctly handling the issue of national relations. He pointed out that the stability and well-being of the people, the fate of the reforms, the fate of the country and its integrity, to a considerable extent, depend on the correct resolution of this issue.

Gorbachev said that if we allow the current phenomenon of national conflicts to continue to develop, what awaits us may be a very bad period. Irresponsible slogans, political incitement, the creation of artificial interests and conflicts, and the expulsion of some nationalities by others, calling for such actions will lead to universal misfortune. Therefore, as the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, he believes it is his responsibility to prevent the increasing danger of sharpening national relations, as well as the consequences this has for society, for every family, and for every individual.

He pointed out that everyone must abide by the laws of the state. Only in this way can the rights of citizens be guaranteed, regardless of which nationality they belong to. The state will defend these rights with all the means at its disposal.

He emphasized that one cannot compromise with those who want to exploit the friction that arises in national relations for nefarious purposes, and one must be particularly intolerant of those who deliberately incite national discord.

Gorbachev proposed ways to solve the accumulated problems and the attitudes that should be adopted. He stressed that one should follow the basic principles of socialism proposed by the 19th Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, so that everyone, regardless of nationality, feels like an equal citizen, has the opportunity to enjoy all the rights stipulated by the constitution, and truly achieves equality among nationalities and equality among all peoples. He also pointed out that not only political and economic reforms are needed, but also reforms of the Soviet Union. When considering the reform of the Union and the coordination of national relations, one cannot ignore the realities that have formed over the past hundred years, especially during the Soviet era. He emphasized that every nationality should be developed in terms of economy, society, and culture. The more prosperous each nationality is, the more solid the Soviet unity will be. He called on intellectuals to take responsibility, as intellectuals have a significant influence on the nationality issue.

Gorbachev said that for the many problems facing us, including the most complex ones, they can only be solved on the basis of democratic discussion, restraint, and mutual understanding. We must not only understand this well but also take action.

    戈氏谈解决民族问题的基础
    ●各民族都享有宪法规定的权利
    ●发展各民族的经济社会与文化
    本报柏林七月二日电　记者许宏治报道：苏共中央总书记、苏联最高苏维埃主席戈尔巴乔夫号召苏联各族人民在友谊和合作的基础上努力解决民族关系方面的问题。
    戈尔巴乔夫七月一日晚上在对全国发表的关于民族关系问题的电视广播讲话中发出了这一号召。苏联中央电视台和电台同时播出了这一重要讲话。他在讲话中论述了正确处理民族关系问题的重要意义。他指出，人们的安定和福利、改革的命运、国家的命运和完整，都在相当程度上取决于这一问题的正确解决。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，如果听任目前民族冲突的现象继续发展，等待我们的将可能是非常糟糕的时期。不负责任的口号、政治煽动、制造人为的利益对立和冲突，使一些民族排挤另一些民族，号召这类行动将会导致普遍的不幸。因此，作为苏联最高苏维埃主席，他认为自己有责任防止正在增大的民族关系尖锐化的危险，以及由此对社会、对每一个家庭、每一个人造成的后果。
    他指出，每个人都应遵守国家的法律，只有这样才能保证公民的权利，不论他属于哪个民族。国家将以它所拥有的一切手段捍卫这些权利。
    他强调，不能和那些想利用民族关系中出现的摩擦、为了罪恶目的进行投机的人妥协，对那些蓄意煽动民族不和的人，尤其不能容忍。
    戈尔巴乔夫提出了解决积累起来的问题的途径和应采取的态度。他强调应按照苏共十九次代表会议提出的社会主义基本原则，使每个人，不论他属于哪个民族，都感到自己是平等的公民，有可能享受到宪法规定的一切权利，真正做到各民族平等、各族人民平等。他还指出，不仅要进行政治改革和经济改革，还需要进行苏维埃联盟的改革。在考虑联盟改革、协调民族关系时，不能不考虑百年来、特别是苏维埃政权时代形成的现实。他强调应使每个民族在经济、社会、文化等方面都得到发展。每个民族越是繁荣昌盛，苏维埃统一就越巩固。他要求知识分子要负起责任来，因为知识分子对民族问题有重大影响。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，对于我们面前出现的许多问题，包括最复杂的问题，只能在民主讨论、克制、互相谅解的基础上解决。对此我们不仅应很好的理解，而且要采取行动。
