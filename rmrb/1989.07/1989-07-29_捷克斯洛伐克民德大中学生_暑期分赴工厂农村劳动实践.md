Xinhua News Agency, Prague, July 28th. This year, Czechoslovakia organized approximately 170,000 college and high school students to go to factories and rural areas to participate in a two-week summer labor program.

In Czechoslovakia's colleges and high schools, summer labor is also known as the "third semester." After the summer vacation begins, students are organized in groups to go to factories and rural areas to participate in various labor activities within their capabilities. Many universities directly link their students with relevant factories and enterprises based on their majors. Students can use summer labor to combine the theories they learn in the classroom with practical experience.

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, July 28th. This summer, the German Democratic Republic (GDR) had over 55,000 college students go to various parts of the country to participate in socialist construction.

These college students formed over 4,000 youth shock brigades, participating in various labor activities such as building houses, repairing roads, protecting forests, and supporting agriculture.

The units responsible for the students participating in the labor do not always assign them simple manual labor. Some college students also undertake technical work. For example, at the Berlin television factory, college students participate in the factory's research activities.

Currently, there are approximately 290,000 college students in the GDR. Each college student, on average, participates in labor for two to three summers during their school years, and they refer to participating in labor during the summer as the "third semester."

    捷克斯洛伐克民德大中学生
    暑期分赴工厂农村劳动实践
    新华社布拉格7月28日电　捷克斯洛伐克今年组织大约17万大、中学生开赴工厂和农村，参加为期两周的暑期劳动。
    在捷大、中学校中，暑期劳动又称“第三学期”，学生放暑假后，有组织地分批到工厂和农村去参加一些力所能及的劳动，不少大学都根据其专业与有关工厂和企业直接挂钩。学生利用暑期劳动可以把课堂上学得的理论与实践结合起来。
    新华社柏林7月28日电　今年暑假民主德国有5.5万多名大学生分赴全国各地参加社会主义建设。
    这些大学生组成4000多个青年突击队，参加建房、修路、护林、支农等多项劳动。
    对参加劳动的大学生有关单位并不都是分配他们从事简单的体力劳动。有的大学生也担负一定的技术性工作，如在柏林电视机厂就有大学生参加厂里的科研活动。
    目前民德在校大学生约29万，每个大学生在校期间平均有二三个暑假参加劳动，并把在暑假参加劳动称之为“第三学期”。
