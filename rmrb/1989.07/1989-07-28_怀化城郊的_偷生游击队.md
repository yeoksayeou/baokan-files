The "Survival Guerrillas" on the Outskirts of Huaihua
Chen Chun

"You want a girl, right? Plump, weighing ten pounds at birth." The owner of a private restaurant, Mr. Yu, mysteriously told me.

My wife has always wanted a daughter because of our son's mischievous behavior. When she heard this, she was overjoyed and said, "Go and adopt her. Girls are gentle and caring. When we get old, we'll have a son-in-law to visit."

Despite the many advantages of adopting a girl, I was still hesitant. Not to mention the economic burden, the biggest problem is the strict family planning policy. Can she be registered?

"That child, do you want her or not? If you don't, someone else will take her. In the past few days, groups of businessmen from Henan and Sichuan have come, offering high prices. Her family wants the best for her, and they heard about your situation from me. They didn't ask for any money and decided to give her to you."

After hearing this, I couldn't help but worry deeply for the baby girl. These days, cases of abducting women and children are often reported in the newspapers. Huaihua is a transportation hub with a complex social situation. The businessmen from Henan and Sichuan who are competing for the baby girl, who knows what their intentions are?

	Deep in the alley, there is a family

Whether it was out of sympathy or curiosity, I decided to go with my wife to see for myself.

In a narrow alley on the outskirts of the city, where cars cannot enter, we finally found the private inn. Mr. Yu led us through rows of dilapidated rooms. He told us that these rooms are rented by people from out of town who come to make a living. They have no household registration, no workplace, and a family of three or four, even five or six, live in one room. The men either do business or work as craftsmen to earn money, while the women stay at home and give birth to one child after another.

I realized that I had stumbled upon the so-called "Survival Guerrillas" base.

"That's the family," Mr. Yu pushed open a half-closed door and casually shouted, "Don't hide anymore, we have guests!"

We walked in, and a hot, musty, and urine-smelling air hit us. This was a dark and low room, about ten square meters in size, with a coal stove, a chest, and a simple bed. On the bed, a young woman was hurriedly getting dressed. She shyly smiled at us and asked us to sit on the chest.

Mr. Yu took the baby girl from the bed and handed her to my wife, praising, "Big forehead, round face, small chin, she will be beautiful when she grows up; upturned nose, small mouth, and big eyes, all good features." My wife couldn't put her down, gently touching the baby's soft cheeks and coaxing, "Smile." The baby girl opened her arms and really smiled.

	Hiding from family planning for four or five years

During our chat, we learned that this family is from Chenxi. The man works as a chef in Mr. Yu's restaurant. The family has been hiding from family planning for four or five years. When asked why they wanted to give the child away, the young mother looked distressed and said she had given birth to four girls in a row while hiding here. Her husband wouldn't stop until he had a son. With too many children, she couldn't afford to raise them, and she was also afraid of the fines when she returned to her hometown with a large group of children. As she spoke, the bedding moved, and three children cried and kicked off the covers. The young mother quickly helped the eldest up, pulled the second one up, wiped their faces, dressed them, and then hugged the third one, who was just over a year old, to comfort her. It was clear that she loved her children. "Take the fourth one," she choked out. I explained to her that we already have a child and are not allowed to adopt another according to the regulations. Mr. Yu said, "Let the mother secretly abandon her on the roadside or in a field, and then you can pick her up and raise her. Many people do this." I said that wouldn't work either, as we would be punished if caught. The mother, full of sorrow, saw that we wouldn't take the child, and with tearful eyes, said, "I only heard from Mr. Yu that you are a respectable and upright family, so I mustered the courage to give the child to you. Since you won't take her, she will have to be given to passersby. Who knows what her fate will be, whether she will become a thief or a prostitute." Saying this, she burst into tears.

Seeing this scene, I really didn't know what to do. Mr. Yu comforted her, saying, "I'll find another good home for the child." With that, he led us out.

	Four girls given away in exchange for a boy

Not far from where we were walking, we encountered a family celebrating the birth of a boy in front of their house. The host was a friend of Mr. Yu and also a member of the "Survival Guerrillas." It turned out that this family had also given birth to four girls in a row, giving one away each time. This time, they finally had a boy. The host held up a bottle of wine and invited us to drink a celebratory cup. I declined, saying I don't drink, and ran away as if escaping.

Two months have passed since the incident. The other day, Mr. Yu bumped into me and laughed, saying that the baby girl had been adopted. Her mother had placed her on the outskirts of the city road early in the morning and hid nearby, watching as someone picked her up.

The family's circumstances are also good. Originally, they had their own children and, in a spirit of altruism, adopted the abandoned baby. The government naturally gave her a household registration.

According to a comrade from the regional family planning commission, in recent years, the phenomenon of out-of-plan births in our Hunan Province's Huaihua region has been on the rise. In 1988 alone, the number of recorded out-of-plan births was 26,005. Currently, there are nearly 10,000 "Survival Guerrillas" hiding in Huaihua City, and the number of black-market births is staggering. According to reports, these "Survival Guerrillas" are spread throughout the province and the country. The consequences of "survival" are shocking, and the negative impact on the country and society will last for several generations!

In my heart, I cried out: Alas! These pitiful and despicable "Survival Guerrillas"!

    怀化城郊的“偷生游击队”
    陈春
    “你想要个女孩吗？胖胖的，落地就有十斤。”开个体饭馆的余老板诡秘地告诉我。
    我家因为犬子顽皮，妻子一直想添个女孩。她知道后，喜形于色地说：“去抱来吧，女孩温顺、疼人，我们老了也有个女婿家走走。”
    尽管抱养女孩的好处有千条，我还是拿不定主意，经济上添了负担且不说，更大的难处是时下计划生育政策这么紧，能上户口吗？
    “那孩子你到底要不要？不要，人家可就抱走了。这几天，河南的、四川的生意人去了一伙一伙的，开的价码可高呢，她家图个好主，听我说起你家情况，一个钱没要，认定给你了。”
    听了这番话，我不禁为那女婴深深担忧，时下拐买妇幼的案件常见诸报端，怀化是交通要地，社会情况复杂，那河南的、四川的生意人争要女婴，天知道是何用心？
          小巷深处有人家
    不知是同情心还是好奇心驱使，我决定同妻一道去看看。
    在城郊一条汽车开不进的小巷里，我们好不容易找到那家个体旅馆。余老板领着我们在一排排简陋破旧的房间中穿行。他告诉我们，这里住的都是远路来此谋生的闲杂人员，无户口，无单位，一家三四口、五六口租住一间民房，男的或是做生意，或是做手艺挣钱，女的便躲在窝里敞开肚皮一胎连一胎地生小孩。
    我明白，我是闯进了所谓的“偷生游击队”的驻地。
    “就是这家”，余老板推开一间半掩着的房门，极随便地喊道，“别窝着了，来客哩！”
    我们走进去，迎面扑来一股夹带着霉味和尿臊气的热浪。这是间阴暗低矮的房子，十来个平方的空间内摆着煤炉、衣箱和一架简易大床。大床上一个年轻妇女在手忙脚乱地穿衣。她朝我们腼腆地笑笑，让我们在衣箱上坐下。
    余老板从被窝里掏出那女婴递给我妻子，评品道：“大额头、圆脸、小下巴，长大了脸模子准定好看；翘鼻子，小巧嘴，还有这大眼睛，都是好看的模样。”妻子爱不释手，拨弄着那粉嘟嘟的嫩脸逗道：“笑笑”，女婴张着双手真的咧嘴作了个笑模样。
    躲“计划生育”躲了四五年
    闲谈中，我们了解到，这家是辰溪人，男人在余老板的饭馆当厨师。一家人为躲“计划生育”已经出来四五年了。当问到为什么要将孩子送人时，那年轻的母亲一脸的愁苦，说她躲在这里连着生了四个女孩，她男人不见男孩不肯罢休。孩子多了，一是自己养不活，二来也怕将来领着这一大群孩子回老家，交不起罚款。正说着，床上的被褥里蠕动起来，接着三个孩子哭叫着蹬开了被子。那年轻母亲赶忙扶起老大，拉起老二，给她们一一擦过脸，穿好衣服，又将那刚满周岁的老三抱在怀里哄着。看得出，她是钟爱她的孩子的。“你们把老四抱走吧，”她哽咽着说。我向她解释，我们已有一个孩子，按规定是不许再抱养的。余老板说：“哪天让孩子妈偷着扔到路边野地里，你们再捡回去养，有许多人就是这样干的。”我说那也不行，上面知道会挨处分的。那饱含愁苦的母亲见我们不肯要孩子，睁着一双哀怜的眼睛说：“我是听余老板说你们是个有脸面的正派人家，才铁着心肠将孩子送给你们，你们不要，就只有送给过路人了，天知道她日后是做贼还是做娼。”说着悲从中来，不能自禁地痛哭起来。
    看着眼前这场面，我真不知怎么办才好。余老板安慰她说：“我另给孩子找个好主。”说罢，他领着我们走了出来。
      送掉四女婴　换来一男孩
    走不多远，正遇着一家“喜添贵子”的在门前场地上设宴庆贺。主家是余老板的熟人，也是“偷生游击队”的成员。原来这家也连着生了四个女孩，生一个送一个，这次终于盼到了一个男孩。主人家提着酒瓶，请我们饮杯喜酒。我推辞不会喝酒，逃也似地跑开了。
    事情过去两个多月了，前几天余老板碰到我时笑着说，那女婴有主了，她母亲那天天不亮把她放在城郊公路边，偷偷藏在不远处，看着人把她抱走了。
    那家家境也不错，原来自己也生得有孩子，发扬风格收养弃婴，政府自然要给上户口。
    听地区计划生育委员会的同志讲，近年来我们湖南省怀化地区违纪生育现象又有抬头之势，1988年一年内计划外生育仅记录在案的就有26005人，怀化市内目前窝藏着“偷生游击队”近万人，那一胎连着一胎的黑市人口更是令人咋舌。据报载，这种“偷生游击队”遍布全省、全国。“偷生”造成的恶果令人触目惊心，给国家给社会造成的恶劣影响将延续几代人！
    我在心底里叫着：唉！这些可怜又可恨的“偷生游击队”！
