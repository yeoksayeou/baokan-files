From July 8 to 10, some districts and counties in Chongqing experienced severe rainstorms and flooding, resulting in significant damage. As of July 10, the city reported 137 deaths, 10 missing, and 432 injured. Large areas of farmland were destroyed, numerous houses collapsed, and transportation and communication in some affected areas were disrupted.

According to the Chongqing City Flood Control and Disaster Relief Command, from July 8 to 10, Chongqing City and its surrounding districts and counties experienced widespread thunderstorms. In particular, Hechuan, Tongnan, Tongliang, and Beibei districts recorded unprecedented rainfall, with some areas receiving up to 316 millimeters. Meanwhile, Suining, Nanchong, and Daxian regions also experienced heavy rainfall ranging from 100 to 400 millimeters, leading to severe flooding in the northern part of the city. Preliminary statistics indicate that over 13,000 houses were damaged, 167 road sections and 35 bridges were destroyed to varying degrees, and communication facilities below the county level were mostly disrupted. Many areas remain surrounded by floodwaters. Hechuan County, the hardest-hit area, has at least 64 confirmed deaths.

Following the disaster, Chongqing City swiftly mobilized resources for flood control and relief efforts. The city has established a Flood Control and Disaster Relief Command to coordinate rescue operations. The mayor, deputy mayors, and various levels of party and government leaders, along with officials and military personnel stationed in Chongqing, have rushed to the front lines of the disaster relief efforts.
