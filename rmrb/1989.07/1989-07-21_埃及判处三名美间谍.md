Egypt Sentences Three American Spies

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 21st - Reporter Lin Jiaoming reports: Egypt's highest national security court yesterday sentenced three American Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) spies to long-term imprisonment and hard labor, punishing those who serve foreign intelligence agencies and harm national interests.

Egyptian doctor Sami and his brother Samir (fugitive) were trained and employed by the CIA to collect Egyptian political and economic intelligence. They were sentenced to 10 years of hard labor and a fine of 10,000 Egyptian pounds. CIA officer Nicholas (fugitive) was sentenced to 5 years of hard labor and a fine of 5,000 Egyptian pounds. The fourth defendant, Sami's wife, was acquitted.

The two Sami brothers received special spy training in the United States and were sent back to Egypt in late 1983 to carry out espionage missions. They regularly provided the CIA with internal political reports on Egypt, including information on religious extremist activities, student unrest, black market exchange rates for the dollar, price increases and their causes, and public opinion trends. CIA officer Nicholas directed their espionage activities and paid each of them a monthly salary of 400 US dollars.

In November 1988, Sami was captured by Egyptian security authorities and confessed to all his espionage activities.
