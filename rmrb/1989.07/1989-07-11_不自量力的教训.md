	On the evening of June 8th, around 9 PM, a six-story building under construction on Dongfeng Street in Yichun City, Jiangxi Province, collapsed due to quality issues. Tragically, many workers were killed or injured. Fortunately, the building was not yet completed and collapsed on the night of the Dragon Boat Festival when there were no pedestrians on the road, so the casualties were relatively minor. This project was undertaken by the Yichun City Housing Construction Company.

	Many medium and small cities have inherently weak construction technologies, and the quality of building materials is difficult to guarantee. Under such conditions, some units blindly pursue the construction of high-rise buildings, and the construction units overreach in undertaking such projects. How could this not lead to problems and bitter consequences!

    不自量力的教训
    六月八日晚九时许，江西宜春市东风大街一幢正在施工的六层楼房因质量问题而倒塌。悲惨的是死伤的民工，幸运的是未竣工的楼房坍塌在端午节的晚上，路上已无行人，伤亡还小一些。这项工程是宜春市房屋住宅公司承建的。
    许多中小城市建筑技术力量本来就十分薄弱，建筑材料的质量又很难得到保证，在这样的条件下，有的单位盲目追求兴建高层建筑，而承建单位不自量力承建这类建筑，这焉能不出漏子，自食苦果！
