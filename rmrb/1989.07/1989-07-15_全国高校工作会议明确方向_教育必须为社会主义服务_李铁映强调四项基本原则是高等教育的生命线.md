The national conference on higher education work was held in Beijing from July 12 to 15. The conference, based on the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the instructions from the Central Committee regarding current higher education work, studied how to learn and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The conference aimed to further unite the broad masses of teachers and students in higher education institutions around the Party Central Committee. It emphasized the need to resolutely carry out the struggle to uphold the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization to the end. The conference also deployed several key tasks for higher education institutions.

Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission, spoke at the closing meeting today. He first, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressed greetings and respect to the higher education institutions' party organizations, cadres, teachers, and the Youth League and student union cadres who have stood firm in the front line of the struggle. He said that they have withstood the test of this severe political struggle, endured hardships, overcome difficulties, and worked hard. He said, "We have achieved decisive victory in this struggle, but we must be soberly aware that the struggle has not ended. There is still a lot of detailed work to be done, especially to deeply reflect on why such a shocking struggle could occur in our higher education institutions? We must seriously summarize the experience and lessons. The foundation and key to doing all this work is to seriously study and resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, further clarify the nature and serious harm of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion."

Li Tieying said, "Education, as a part of the superstructure, is undoubtedly class-based. The question of cultivating whom and how to cultivate is the fundamental issue in the field of education. For a period of time, some people have been unclear about this issue, and even confused. In implementing the educational policy, it is not about the all-around development of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, aesthetics, and labor, nor is it about putting the correct political direction in the first place. Instead, it is about intelligence first. He said that this turmoil should make us aware and clear: education must serve socialism, education must adhere to the socialist direction, and use Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought to educate young students and cultivate successors for the socialist cause. To adhere to the socialist direction of education, it is necessary to strengthen the party's leadership over schools and ensure the leading and core political role of the party organization in educational work."

Li Tieying emphasized that the four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state and also the lifeline of higher education in our country. To uphold the four cardinal principles in higher education institutions, we must use Marxism and Mao Zedong Thought to clearly criticize the bourgeois liberalization trend. We must criticize extreme individualism and anarchist ideas, pointing out that this trend will inevitably lead to opposing socialism politically and worshipping capitalism. We must strengthen legal education to enable students to exercise their democratic rights within the legal framework. We must seriously study and reform the teaching of social sciences, adhere to Marxism as the guiding ideology, and not allow the dissemination of bourgeois liberalization views on the lecterns of socialist universities.

He also pointed out that after achieving decisive victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the party and government's basic policies on developing and reforming our educational cause, and the policy of respecting knowledge and respecting talents will not only not change, but will be further improved. Higher education institutions, as well as the entire educational front, will continue to implement the basic line of "taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up." They will implement the policy of "education serving socialist construction, and socialist construction relying on education."

Participants in this national conference on higher education work included some provincial deputy secretaries or deputy governors in charge of higher education work, some provincial and municipal higher education work committee secretaries, provincial and municipal education commission directors or higher education bureau directors, some departmental education bureau directors, and party committee secretaries or presidents of 100 higher education institutions directly under the central government and local governments. The attendees deeply studied the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Party, further unified and raised their understanding of the nature and significance of this struggle, and analyzed and studied the current situation of higher education institutions.

During the conference, central leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, and Li Tieying had a discussion with some representatives attending the conference.

    全国高校工作会议明确方向
    教育必须为社会主义服务
    李铁映强调四项基本原则是高等教育的生命线
    新华社北京7月15日电  全国高等学校工作会议7月12日至15日在北京召开。会议根据邓小平同志重要讲话精神，根据中央常委对当前高校工作的指示，研究了如何学习、贯彻十三届四中全会精神，进一步把高校广大师生员工紧密团结在党中央的周围，坚决把当前这场坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化的斗争进行到底，并就高等学校当前需要做好的几项工作作了部署。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映在今天的总结会上讲了话。他首先代表党中央、国务院向坚定地站在斗争第一线，经受了这场严峻政治斗争考验，不畏艰苦、不怕困难、努力工作的高校党组织、广大干部教师，以及共青团组织和学生会干部，表示慰问和敬意。他说，我们已经取得了这场斗争的决定性胜利，但必须清醒地看到，斗争还没有结束，还有大量细致的工作要做，特别是还要深刻反思，为什么在我们高等学校里竟会发生这样一场触目惊心的斗争？应当认真总结经验教训。而做好这一切工作的基础和关键，在于认真学习、坚决贯彻四中全会精神，进一步认清这场动乱和反革命暴乱的本质和严重危害。
    李铁映说，教育作为上层建筑的一个领域，无可否认是具有阶级性的。培养什么人，怎么培养的问题，始终是教育领域根本问题。一个时期以来，对这个问题却有些人不那么清楚，甚至糊涂了。在执行教育方针上不是德智体美劳全面发展，更不是把坚定正确的政治方向放在第一位，而是智育高于一切。他说，这场动乱应当使我们警觉起来，明确起来：教育必须为社会主义服务，教育必须坚持社会主义方向，用马列主义毛泽东思想教育青年学生，培养社会主义事业的接班人。而坚持教育的社会主义方向，就必须坚持和加强党对学校的领导，保证党组织在教育工作中的领导和政治核心作用。
    李铁映强调，四项基本原则是立国之本，也是我国高等教育的生命线。在高等学校坚持四项基本原则，就必须运用马克思主义和毛泽东思想，旗帜鲜明地批判资产阶级自由化思潮。要批判极端个人主义和无政府主义思想，指出这种思潮必然导致在政治上反对社会主义，崇拜资本主义。要加强法制教育，使学生学会在法制的轨道上行使自己的民主权利。要认真研究和改革社会科学的教学，坚持以马克思主义为指导，绝不能听任在社会主义大学的讲坛上任意散布资产阶级自由化观点。
    他还指出，在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利以后，党和政府关于发展和改革我国教育事业的基本方针政策，关于尊重知识、尊重人才的知识分子政策不仅不会改变，而且要努力搞得更好。高等学校以至整个教育战线将继续贯彻“以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革、开放”的基本路线，贯彻“教育必须为社会主义建设服务，社会主义建设必须依靠教育”的方针。
    参加这次全国高校工作会议的有一些省主管高校工作的省委副书记或副省长，一些省市的高校工委书记，各省市自治区的教委主任或高教局长，一些部委的教育司局长，中央部委和地方所属的一百个高校的党委书记或校长。与会同志深入学习了党的四中全会精神，进一步统一和提高了对这场斗争的性质和意义的认识，分析研究了当前高等学校的情况。
    会议期间，中央领导同志江泽民、李鹏、李瑞环、李铁映同参加会议的部分代表举行了座谈。
