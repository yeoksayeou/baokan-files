People's Daily, Washington, July 8th - Correspondent Zhang Liang reports: The U.S. State Department announced yesterday that it has approved Boeing's sale of four 757-200 aircraft to China, and Honeywell's export of aircraft navigation equipment to China.

The decision was made by Secretary of State James Baker and coordinated with the White House. A White House spokesman said, "I'm sure he (President Bush) is aware of this matter." A State Department spokesman also said that the State Department's decision is in line with President Bush's intention, which is "not to disrupt non-military commercial trade with the People's Republic of China."

It is reported that since the early 1970s, Boeing has exported commercial aircraft worth $2.35 billion to China. Experts also estimate that China is a potential, vast market for aircraft imports.

    美国务院宣布
    批准波音公司向我出售客机
    本报华盛顿7月8日电  记者张亮报道：美国国务院昨天宣布，批准波音公司向中国出售4架757—200型客机，并批准霍内维尔（Honeywell）公司向中国出口飞机导航设备。
    上述决定是贝克国务卿作出的，并与白宫进行了协调。白宫发言人说，“我肯定他（布什总统）了解此事。”国务院发言人也说，国务院的决定与布什总统的意图是一致的，即“不打断与中华人民共和国的非军事商业性贸易”。
    据报道，从70年代初以来，波音公司已向中国出口了价值23.5亿美元的商业性飞机。专家们还估计，中国是一个潜在的、巨大的飞机进口市场。
