    The industrial production in the first half of the year has remained stable, while structural contradictions remain prominent and economic benefits have declined. Xinhua News Agency reported from Beijing on July 7th: The State Statistical Bureau today released the industrial production rapid report showing that since this year, China's industrial production, while experiencing a slowdown in the high growth rate, has maintained relatively stable development. However, the irrational structure within the industry has not significantly improved, and some new problems have emerged in the process of rectification and regulation, which are mainly reflected in the decline of industrial economic benefits.

    In June, the total industrial output value nationwide reached 11.89 billion yuan, an increase of 8.8% compared to the same period last year. From January to June, the total industrial output value nationwide reached 63.96 billion yuan, an increase of 10.8% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the first quarter saw a growth of 10.4%, and the second quarter saw a growth of 11.1%. The output value of light industry was 32.36 billion yuan, an increase of 11.3%, and the output value of heavy industry was 31.6 billion yuan, an increase of 10.3%. The growth of state-owned industry was 6.1%, with a slight increase in the second quarter compared to the first. The growth of collective-owned industry was 16.6%, with a slight decrease in the second quarter compared to the first. Among them, the growth of township enterprises was the most significant, with a growth of 27.7% in the first quarter and only 18.8% in the second quarter.

    The structural contradictions within the industry remain prominent. This year, various places have focused on the production of energy, raw materials, and basic daily necessities. Among them, the total energy production increased from a growth of 1.5% in the first two months to a cumulative growth of 5.9% in the first half of the year, and most chemical raw materials maintained a growth trend. The production of household appliances such as televisions and refrigerators has maintained a high growth rate. However, the situation of energy and power shortages and raw material shortages has not improved.

    There are many problems with industrial economic benefits. This is mainly reflected in the accumulation of some products, the significant overspending of costs, and the unreasonable distribution of profits.

    In the first five months of this year, the comparable product costs of industrial enterprises within the budget increased by 18% compared to last year, which is the highest in recent years.

    Relevant experts analyzed that the industrial growth rate in the first half of this year has decreased by 6.4 percentage points compared to the same period last year, which indicates that the macro-control measures have played an important role, and it is also the inevitable result of the uncoordinated development within the industry, especially the weakness of the basic industry, the "bottleneck effect" forcing the industrial production speed to slow down. However, it should also be seen that various factors that induce the industrial production speed to rebound still exist, and once relaxed, it may lead to the rebound of the industrial growth rate. In the second half of the year, we must firmly implement the macro-control policy, focus on adjusting the product structure, ensure the production of large and medium-sized enterprises, and actively open up sales channels to further stabilize the market.

    上半年工业生产发展平稳
    结构性矛盾依然突出经济效益下降
    本报北京7月7日电　记者张国荣报道：国家统计局今天发布的工业生产快报显示：今年以来，我国工业在过高增长速度回落的同时，保持了生产较为平稳的发展。但工业内部结构不合理的状况并未明显改善，有的方面还在发展，同时在治理整顿中又出现了一些新问题，突出表现在工业经济效益下降。
    6月份全国共完成工业总产值1189亿元，比去年同期增长8.8％。1至6月累计全国完成工业总产值6396亿元，比去年同期增长10.8％。其中1季度增长10.4％，2季度增长11.1％。轻工业产值3236亿元，增长11.3％，重工业产值3160亿元，增长10.3％。全民所有制工业增长6.1％，2季度比1季度稳中有升。集体所有制工业增长16.6％，2季度比1季度略有回落。其中乡办工业回落最为明显，1季度增长27.7％，2季度只增长18.8％。
    工业内部结构矛盾依然突出。今年以来，各地着重抓了能源、原材料和基本生活用品的生产。其中能源生产总量由头两个月增长1.5％加快到上半年累计增长5.9％，化工原材料多数保持增长势头。电视机、电冰箱等家用电器产量一直保持较高增长速度。但能源电力紧张、原材料短缺局面并未得到改善。
    工业经济效益问题较多。主要表现在部分产品积压、成本大幅度超支和利润分配使用不合理。
    今年头5个月预算内工业可比产品成本比去年上升18％，是近年最高的。
    有关专家分析认为，今年上半年的工业增长速度比去年同期回落了6.4个百分点，这说明从宏观上进行总量控制的措施起了重要作用，同时也是工业内部比例不协调发展的必然结果，特别是基础工业薄弱，“瓶颈效益”迫使工业生产速度回落。但也应看到各种诱发工业生产速度回升的因素依然存在，稍有放松，就可能导致工业增长速度回升。下半年仍要坚定不移地贯彻总量控制方针，重点抓好产品结构调整，保证大中型企业生产，同时积极疏通销售渠道，进一步稳定市场。
