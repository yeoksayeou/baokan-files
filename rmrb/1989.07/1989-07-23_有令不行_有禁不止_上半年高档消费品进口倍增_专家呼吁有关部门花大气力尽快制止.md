Despite repeated government orders to strictly limit the import of high-end consumer goods, the import volume and value of consumer electronics in China have continued to surge in the first half of this year.

In 1987, the state issued strict orders to limit the import of high-end consumer goods. However, the import of some high-end consumer goods has continued to grow rapidly. According to customs statistics, the import of consumer electronics such as color televisions, picture tubes, video recorders, and motorcycles in 1988 increased nearly onefold compared to 1987. Such a large increase last year already made it difficult for China to bear the foreign exchange burden. However, looking at the general trade import situation in the first half of this year, several high-end consumer goods have seen significant increases compared to the same period last year. Among them, the import volume of color televisions increased by 200%, video recorders by 170%, travel cars by 270%, cameras by 99%, and motorcycles by 200%.

Experts believe that the rapid growth in the import of high-end consumer goods is not only detrimental to the development of China's national industries but also that if this uncontrolled situation is not stopped in time, it will have disastrous consequences. Relevant departments should take decisive action, seriously implement national policies, strictly review, and curb this wave of high-end consumer goods imports.

    有令不行　有禁不止
    上半年高档消费品进口倍增
    专家呼吁有关部门花大气力尽快制止
    新华社北京7月23日电  （实习生徐伟）尽管国家三令五申严格限制高档消费品成品的进口，而今年上半年我国消费类机电产品进口的数量和金额仍然猛增不下。
    1987年国家就下令严格限制高档消费品的进口。但是，有些高档消费品进口仍成倍增长。据海关统计，去年彩色电视机、显像管、录（放）像机、摩托车等消费类机电产品的进口比1987年增长近一倍。去年如此大幅度的增长已使我国的外汇难以承受，可是，从今年上半年一般贸易进口情况看，有几种高档消费品进口比去年同期仍有较大幅度增长，其中进口数量彩电增加2倍，录（放）像机增加1.7倍，旅行车增加2.7倍，照像机增加99％，摩托车增加2倍。
    专家们认为，高档消费品进口增长过快，不仅不利于我国民族工业的发展，而且这种失控状况如不尽快制止，将贻害无穷。有关部门该花大力气，切实负起责来，认真执行国家有关政策，从严审查，煞住这股高档消费品的进口热潮。
