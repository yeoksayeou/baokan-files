Currently, more than half of the households in the country have participated in household property insurance. Due to the diverse situations, handling insurance claims often leads to disputes. Below are answers to several commonly asked questions provided by colleagues from the People's Insurance Company of China.

Q: A resident has insured his household property, including one house with an insurance amount of 4000 yuan and clothing, bedding, household items, and electrical appliances worth 6000 yuan, totaling 10000 yuan. A fire caused 6000 yuan in damage to the house and 4000 yuan in damage to other property. However, the insurance company only compensated 8000 yuan. Why is that?

A: The household property insurance policy clearly states that the maximum amount of compensation is limited to the insurance amount specified for each item on the insurance policy, not the total insurance amount. Therefore, although the house was insured for 4000 yuan and the actual loss was 6000 yuan, the insurance company can only compensate 4000 yuan. Adding the actual loss of 4000 yuan for other property, the total compensation is 8000 yuan.

Q: A resident wrote in to say that he insured his household property for 7000 yuan in January last year. In June, due to relocation, he moved to a new address. Shortly after moving, a flood caused over 3000 yuan in damage to his property. However, the insurance company refused to handle the claim and did not provide compensation. He expressed his confusion.

A: The insurance policy states that the insurance company is only responsible for the household property listed on the insurance policy at the specified location. If the location changes, the policyholder must notify the insurance company to update the records. Otherwise, the insurance company will not handle the claim or provide compensation.

Q: A policyholder has participated in household property insurance for several consecutive years. Recently, a fire caused over 10000 yuan in damage, including a gold necklace worth over 3000 yuan and more than 1000 yuan in cash. However, the insurance company excluded the necklace and cash from the compensation. Why is that?

A: The insurance company covers property within a specific range. Currently, the unified household property insurance policy in China specifies the following items as "non-covered property": gold, jewelry, gems, currency, securities, tickets, stamps, antiques, old books, paintings, documents, accounts, technical data, charts, livestock, flowers, trees, fish, birds, potted plants, and other property whose value cannot be determined.

    家庭财产保险理赔问答
    目前，全国有一半以上的家庭参加了家庭财产保险。由于情况各异，处理保险赔案时往往引起争议。现就人们普遍关心的几个问题，请中国人民保险公司的同志解答。
    问：有位居民投保了家庭财产保险，其中1栋房屋保险金额为4000元，衣被、用具、家用电器6000元，共计10000元。一场火灾，使房屋损失6000元，其它财产损失4000元。可是，保险公司只赔8000元不知为什么？
    答：家庭财产保险条款明确规定，保险赔款的最高数额以不超过保险单上列明的分项财产的保险金额为限，不是以总保险金额为限。因此，房屋投保金额为4000元，即使实际损失6000元，保险公司也只能赔4000元，加上其它财产实际损失4000元，共赔8000元。
    问：一位居民来信说，他去年元月份投保了家庭财产7000元，6月份因拆迁原因而搬家。谁知搬到新址不久，一场洪水使家中财产损失了3000多元。可是保险公司却不受理，更不负责赔偿。他表示不理解。
    答：保险条款规定，保险公司只对保险单上所载明地点的家庭财产负保险责任。地点若有变动，需出面通知保险公司办理手续才行，否则，保险公司不能受理，也不能赔偿。
    问：一位保户连续几年都参加了家庭财产保险。最近的一场火灾损失了1万多元，其中一副纯金项链就值3000多元，还烧毁1000多元现金。保险公司理赔时，却剔除了项链和现金。这是为什么？
    答：保险公司承保的财产是有一定范围的。目前，我国统一的家庭财产保险条款上规定的“不保财产”是：金银、首饰、珠宝、货币、有价证券、票证、邮票、古玩、古书、字画、文件、帐册、技术资料、图表、家畜、花、树、鱼、鸟、盆景及其他无法鉴定价值的财产。
