Title: Medical Waste Used as Toys Harms Children

Recently, in many places, there has been a disturbing trend: some people use discarded, used medical infusion tubes from hospitals to weave small items, such as "goldfish" and "lobsters," to give to children as toys. Others give children discarded disposable syringes to play with as water guns. Even more alarmingly, some people weave these discarded items into small objects and sell them to students in schools. Little do they know, this practice poses serious health risks and has long-term consequences.

As far as I know, all used disposable medical supplies should be destroyed. This is a regulation in the medical and health departments. If these items, which have been contaminated with viruses and bacteria, are allowed to enter society, they will cause harm, endanger people's health, and especially harm children's health. This is not an exaggeration. I hope to use this opportunity to appeal through your newspaper: for the sake of children's health, we must strengthen the management of discarded medical supplies and not overlook such "small matters."

    一次性医疗用品作玩具贻害儿童
    近一段时期，许多地方出现了这样的情况：有的人用医院废弃的已使用过的一次性输液皮管编织一些小物件，诸如“小金鱼”、“龙虾”等，用来给小孩玩，或将废弃的一次性注射器给小孩当水枪玩，更有甚者竟用这些废品编织小物件在学校向小学生们出售。殊不知，这种作法贻害人们健康，后患无穷。
    据笔者所知，凡一次性医疗用品使用后都应销毁，这在医疗卫生部门是有规定的。如果让那些被病毒、细菌污染过的废品流入社会，就会给社会带来危害，危害人们的健康，特别是危害孩子们的健康。这绝不是危言耸听。希望借贵报一角呼吁：为了孩子们的健康，应加强废旧医疗物品的管理，切不可忽视这样的“小事”。
