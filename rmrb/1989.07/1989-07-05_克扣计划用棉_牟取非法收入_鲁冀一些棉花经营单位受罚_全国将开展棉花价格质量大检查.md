Recently, the State Price Bureau and the State Bureau of Technical Supervision jointly inspected the implementation of cotton quality standards and price policies in Shandong and Hebei provinces. Several cotton operating units in these provinces were heavily penalized for their serious illegal activities.

The Yucheng Railway Cotton Mill in Dezhou, Shandong Province, openly deducted cotton allocated to planned users. In the three batches of cotton inspected, 1680 bales should have been delivered, but only 1275 bales were actually delivered. The mill also threatened to stop supplies and demanded payment for the full number of bales. Additionally, the mill falsified records to raise the cotton grade and length. From these three batches alone, the mill illegally gained 317,000 yuan. The State Price Bureau and the State Bureau of Technical Supervision decided to confiscate the mill's illegal earnings and impose a fine of 500,000 yuan.

The Lihuza and Zhangxizhuang Cotton Processing Plants in Yongnian County, Hebei Province, mixed over 1 ton of talcum powder into 450 tons of cotton, causing the cotton mill direct economic losses of 150,000 yuan, with even more severe indirect losses. Relevant departments imposed economic penalties on the two plants in accordance with the law. The county Party committee and government also decided to impose disciplinary and administrative penalties on the main responsible persons of these two plants and requested the judicial authorities to pursue their legal responsibilities.

To further rectify and regulate the cotton circulation order, with the approval of the State Council, the State Price Bureau and the State Bureau of Technical Supervision decided to conduct a nationwide industry-wide inspection in the second half of this year.

    克扣计划用棉　牟取非法收入
    鲁冀一些棉花经营单位受罚
    全国将开展棉花价格质量大检查
    本报北京7月5日讯　最近，国家物价局和国家技术监督局联合检查了山东、河北两省执行棉花质量标准和价格政策的情况，对其中几家棉花经营单位的严重违法行为予以重罚。
    山东省德州地区禹城县车站棉厂公开克扣计划用棉单位的棉花。在所检查的三批棉花中，应发1680包，实发1275包，并以停止供货相威胁，要求对方按应发包数结算货款。同时，该厂还弄虚作假，提高棉花品级和长度。仅上述三批棉花就获非法收入31.7万元。国家物价局、国家技术监督局决定，没收该厂非法所得，罚款50万元。
    河北省永年县李胡寨、张西堡棉花加工厂在450吨棉花中掺入1吨多滑石粉，造成棉纺厂直接经济损失15万元，间接损失更为严重。有关部门依法对上述两厂实行了经济处罚。县委、县政府还决定对这两个厂的主要负责人给予党纪及行政处分，并提请司法部门追究其法律责任。
    为了进一步治理、整顿棉花流通秩序，经国务院同意，国家物价局、国家技术监督局决定：今年下半年开展一次全国性的行业大检查。
