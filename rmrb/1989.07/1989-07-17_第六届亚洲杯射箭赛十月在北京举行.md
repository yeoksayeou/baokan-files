The Sixth Asian Cup Archery Competition, originally scheduled for late June in Beijing, has been rescheduled to October 4-7 in Beijing. This decision was made recently by the Asian Archery Federation Council.

The Asian Archery Federation Council held three meetings on July 2, 3, and 7 in Lausanne, Switzerland, to discuss matters related to the Sixth Asian Cup Archery Competition. On July 7, the council unanimously passed a resolution to reschedule the competition, which was originally set for June 22-25 in Beijing, to October 4-7 in Beijing.

The meeting also decided that this competition will trial the elimination system approved by the Asian Archery Federation Council in Seoul last October. The competition will officially award medals for four events: men's and women's individual all-around and men's and women's team events. To encourage Asian athletes to participate actively in this competition, medals will also be awarded to the winners of the men's and women's four distance individual events. The council members present at the July 7 meeting included representatives from China, South Korea, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, and Chinese Taipei. According to the Asian Archery Federation's charter, the presence of five council members constitutes a quorum, making all decisions made at this meeting valid. Representatives from the host country, China Archery Association, as well as representatives from India, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Nepal, which recently joined the International Archery Federation, were invited to attend the meeting and actively participated in the discussions.
