Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, July 13th.

Laos has recently launched a sudden attack on Thailand's policy of "transforming the Indochina battlefield into a market." The Thai government is shocked by this move and suspects that it may have a Vietnamese background.

According to a report by Thailand's _Nation_ newspaper today, the Lao "Voice of the People" radio station recently criticized Thailand's policy of "transforming the Indochina battlefield into a market," accusing it of attempting to subvert Laos through economic means.

Thai government spokesman Suvi Yumani issued a statement on the 12th denying the accusations. He said that the Thai government has been working to strengthen Thai-Lao relations. He also hinted that Laos' sudden "negative" attitude towards Thailand's Indochina policy might be the result of recent visits to Laos by Vietnamese leaders Nguyen Van Linh and Do Muoi.

    老挝攻击泰国印支政策  泰国疑此举有越南背景
    新华社曼谷7月13日电  据泰国《民族报》今天报道，老挝最近突然对泰国的“变印支战场为市场”的政策大肆攻击。泰国政府对此感到震惊，并怀疑此事可能有越南背景。
    报道说，老挝“万象之声”广播电台最近在一篇评论中指责泰国“变印支战场为市场”的政策是企图以经济手段颠覆老挝。
    泰国政府发言人苏维·尤马尼12日发表谈话对此表示否认，他说，泰国政府一直在努力加强泰老关系。他还暗示道，老挝对泰国的印支政策突然持“否定”态度，可能是越南领导人阮文灵和杜梅最近访问老挝的结果。
