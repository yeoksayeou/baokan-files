After crossing a 2,500-meter-long arched sea bridge and then a 2,225-meter-long, flat sea road bridge, one arrives at the southernmost part of Macau, the island of Coloane. Here stands Macau's first heavy industry—Macau Cement Factory. The two towering cement storage silos can be seen from afar. This is quite a sight in Macau, which has traditionally been known for its tourism and light industries.

Early June saw news circulating in Macau: the Macau International Airport decided to commence construction, with work starting within the year. The deep-water port, oil terminal, and warehouse construction have also begun. Looking at the bustling areas of Macau Island, the tallest building in Macau at the moment—the 36-story China Bank Macau Branch—is rising rapidly. A batch of hotels, shopping centers, and malls are also under construction. After the completion of the horse racing track built by Taiwanese investors on Taipa Island, Macau will have both greyhound racing and horse racing. The booming construction and real estate industry in Macau has made cement a hot commodity.

"We can't stop production; Macau's construction projects will be immediately affected," said the general manager of Macau Cement Factory with a touch of pride, and it's not an exaggeration. Cement used in Macau has always been imported; now, 90% is supplied by this factory, and all bagged cement is shipped directly from the factory. In May of this year, the factory supplied an average of 500 tons of bagged cement per day.

How about the quality? The factory manager, hired from a Swiss company, and his Chinese colleagues spoke with a similar sense of pride: "It meets the Chinese mainland's 600-grade standard."

The factory, which started production at the end of 1983, did not have a smooth beginning. Despite having advanced equipment from France, West Germany, and other countries, the factory faced difficulties due to various reasons and incurred losses year after year. The main investor later requested Macau's prominent businessman Ma Wan-ki to recommend the factory to China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC).

Should CITIC invest or not?

"Investing in a loss-making enterprise is not appealing; it might end up being a burden," some said, sparking debates within CITIC.

"However, it is the only new heavy industry in Macau, with potential advantages and a large market," said Rong Yiren, the chairman who has always been interested in real businesses, deciding to fully support the investment.

CITIC gradually increased its stake, and during the factory's financial difficulties, CITIC also provided guarantees for loans. Now, CITIC is the controlling shareholder with a stake of over 75%.

New forces brought new results. After the main investor passed away, CITIC sent personnel to manage the factory, including the position of general manager. After several years of hard work, the factory overcame its difficulties, established its brand, and turned a profit in 1987 and 1988. The annual return on investment for shareholders was 15%.

Currently, the factory produces 60-65 million tons of cement annually, with 30% supplied locally and the rest sold to Hong Kong and coastal cities in Guangdong like Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Shantou. The products are in high demand. The factory manager jokingly said, "We have no choice but to select good customers to sell to."

It seems that CITIC's move was the right one. The current chairman of the board of directors, Ma Wan-ki, who also holds shares, said, "If it weren't for CITIC's foresight and courage, the cement factory might have gone bankrupt at that time."

After touring the cement factory, one can't help but exclaim, "It's so large, and more than half of the land is still undeveloped!" This cement factory is not a full-scale operation; it does not produce clinker but instead processes clinker into cement. They are in talks with cement factories in Guangdong that produce clinker to purchase more clinker nearby, reducing the need for imports. The Macau government attaches great importance to the construction of cement factories. Initially, they allocated 113,800 square meters of land, a prime location. With the support of the governor, all applications made by the factory are smoothly approved. On June 3, the factory manager told reporters, "We just had a board meeting and decided to expand the equipment, increasing the annual production capacity by more than 20 million tons."

The heavy industry in Macau is blooming beautifully on this small island surrounded by the sea.

    中信公司参股百分之七十五以上的澳门水泥厂，产品质量上乘，既满足澳门建筑地产业对水泥的需求，又将有利于推进澳门经济结构的健康发展。请读通讯：
    澳门第一家
    本报记者　计泓赓
    穿过2500米长的拱形跨海桥，再穿过2225米长、平展展的跨海公路桥，便到了澳门最南端的路环岛。澳门第一家重工业——澳门水泥厂就设在这里。那高耸云天的两座水泥贮存罐，远远即可望见。这在一向以旅游、轻手工业为主的澳门来讲，可谓稀罕之物。
    6月初，澳门就传出消息：澳门国际机场决定兴建，年内即将动工。澳门深水港、石油码头和仓库建设也已揭开序幕。再看看澳门本岛繁华地段，一座目前澳门最高建筑物——36层的中国银行澳门分行新厦，正拔地而起；一批酒店、购物中心、商场也在建设中。凼仔岛台商投资的赛马场建成后，澳门跑狗、赛马就齐全了。蓬勃发展的澳门建筑地产业，使得水泥成了俏货、抢手货。
    “我们厂要一停，澳门的建筑工程马上受影响。”澳门水泥厂总裁略带自豪的语气，并非夸张。澳门使用的水泥，一向依赖进口；现在，90％由这个厂供应，散装水泥则全部由厂里就地发货。今年5月份，平均每天供应散装水泥500吨。
    质量如何呢？从瑞士一家公司请来的工厂总经理和他的中国同事们谈起时，同样略带几分自豪感：“相当于中国内地600号以上标准。”
    1983年底建成、投产的这家水泥厂，头三年光景并不理想。尽管有来自法国、联邦德国等一系列比较先进的设备，但由于创业维艰和多种原因，工厂连年亏损，陷入困境。后来，该厂主要投资者要求澳门工商界知名人士马万祺向中国国际信托投资公司推荐。
    参股不参股？
    “亏本企业没啥意思，弄不好会背上包袱。”有人这样说，中信公司内部有争论。
    “它是澳门新建的唯一重工业，工厂有潜在优势，市场潜力也很大呢。”一向对办实业有兴趣的董事长荣毅仁，决定全力支持。
    中信参股逐年增加，工厂资金困难时中信还为其担保还贷。现在中信已是控股股东，参股达75％以上。
    新的力量产生新的效应。那位主要投资者病故后，中信派人到厂担任总裁等职，还从国外聘来了总经理。几经奋斗，水泥厂跳出困难低谷，闯出牌子，1987、1988年连续扭亏为盈。股东的年回报率为15％。
    目前，工厂年产水泥60—65万吨，30％供应本地，其余畅销香港及深圳、珠海、汕头等广东沿海地带。产品供不应求。工厂负责人不无幽默地说：“没办法，我们只能挑好客户卖了。”
    看来，中信公司这步棋走对了。现任厂股东大会主席、参有股份的马万祺说：“要不是中信有远见，有魄力，当时水泥厂可能要垮掉。”
    在水泥厂转上一圈，唷！好大，还有一半多地没有开发呢。这个水泥厂不是全规模的，不搞烧窑，买进粒状熟料加工研磨成水泥。他们正与广东有烧窑的水泥厂联系，打算就近多买些熟料，以减少熟料进口。澳门当局对兴建水泥厂比较重视，当初一下子就批地11.38万平方米，地段又理想，由于总督支持，工厂办什么申请均能顺利通过。6月3日，工厂总裁对记者说：“刚刚开过董事会，准备扩充设备，增加年产量20多万吨。”
    澳门重工业这一枝花，正在碧海围绕的小小岛上盛开怒放。（附图片）
