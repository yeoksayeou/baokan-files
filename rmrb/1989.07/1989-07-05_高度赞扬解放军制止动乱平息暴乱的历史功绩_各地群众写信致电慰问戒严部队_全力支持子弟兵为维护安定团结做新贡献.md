Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th.

Recently, people from all over the country have written letters and sent telegrams to express their concern for the troops enforcing martial law in the capital. They have expressed their love and respect for the People's Liberation Army, highly praised the army's contributions in stopping the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, and expressed their support for the soldiers in maintaining political stability and unity.

Letters and telegrams have been sent by elderly people, youngsters, experts, scholars, students, cadres, workers, peasants, and religious figures, among others. Many letters have highly praised the PLA for resolutely carrying out the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, bravely facing hardships, and sacrificing themselves to quell the counter-revolutionary riot and create historical merits. Some members of the Political Consultative Conference in Hu County, Shaanxi Province, wrote in a letter to the troops enforcing martial law, "You have followed the Party's call, swiftly quashed this riot, defended the Party Central Committee, and defended the People's Republic of China established by revolutionary forerunners with their blood. You are indeed a loyal army to the Party and the people." Workers from the Civil Affairs and Welfare Factory in Bama Yao Autonomous County, Guangxi, wrote in a letter, "Every drop of your blood and sweat is on our hearts. You have used your precious youth to achieve great merits for the people. Everything you have done is in our eyes and engraved in the hearts of the people." Many students have also sent letters of concern, sharing their understanding of the soldiers' spirit of sacrifice. Some students who participated in the Beijing parade and other activities also introduced their changing views on the riot. A student from Peking University wrote in a letter, "I was misled by some bad people and rumors, and said some extreme words and did some excessive things. Now, I feel deeply regretful. Compared to you, my peers, I feel extremely guilty!" A student from Sichuan Foreign Languages Institute wrote in a letter, "Because we are young and impulsive, we believed the rumors in the past. Now, the bloody facts are in front of us, and we feel ashamed. I think we students should reflect on our actions. I believe that all students with conscience and brains can draw the correct conclusion."

Many retired old soldiers, old Eighth Route Army members, and old warriors have also sent letters of concern. They wrote in their letters, "Seeing the new generation carry on the old traditions, we are genuinely happy. Please accept our salute, old soldiers." More than 1,000 retired cadres from a rest home jointly sent a telegram of concern, saying, "Although we are retired, our hearts are always with you. In a word, with you guarding the country, we are at ease, and our country will never change color."

Factories, rural areas, and enterprises across the country have sent letters expressing their determination to do their jobs well, stay at their posts, and carry out production to support the troops enforcing martial law and support the wise decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau introduced in a letter their production situation during the turmoil, expressing their determination to do their work well and ensure the smooth operation of the railway arteries to support the PLA. The leading organs of Huguang County, Shanxi Province, listed in a letter of concern the facts of their insistence on good production since April, and the good situation in the whole county. Some engineering and technical personnel reported in their letters the good news of their technological innovations and inventions. Many faculty and staff of colleges and universities expressed in their letters their determination to do a good job in teaching, strengthen ideological and political education, and cultivate the next generation for the motherland. Many military families have sent letters of concern, filled with tears and emotions. The wife of a soldier wrote in a letter, "Seeing you endure hardships, shed blood, and sacrifice yourselves, we are filled with pain and longing. The country would not be a country without soldiers. Dear ones, do not worry about us at home. Just complete your mission well. We have nothing else to say. We will take on all the things you should do but cannot do temporarily, support you, and be worthy of half of your military medals."
