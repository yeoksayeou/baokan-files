    A Mountain Village with 16 Years of No Unplanned Births
    In Yangjiawu Village of Maoshan Town in our county, there are 5 village groups and 478 residents, living scattered and difficult to manage. Since 1973, the village party branch secretary has changed twice, and the women's director has changed once, but the family planning work has been consistently carried out.
    During the tenure of the old party branch secretary Zhang Jinqu, all unmarried and childbearing-age youth in the village signed late marriage and late childbearing contracts. The second party branch secretary Li Ruifa focused on the leading role of party members. In 1987, the village implemented the party member household responsibility system.
    The current party branch secretary Jia Guodong has been vigorously promoting the propaganda work of improving population quality through better childbearing. To solve the problem of scattered residences and inconvenient propaganda, the village invested in purchasing equipment, and party members voluntarily worked to install 8 high-volume loudspeakers in different areas on July 1st.
    In the family planning work, the women's director of this village played a significant role. The former women's director Yu Aifeng, who managed the family planning work for 12 years, was familiar with the situation of childbearing-age women. She would timely deliver contraceptives to those who ran out...
    The current women's director Su Xiaohua insists on conducting monthly home visits, delivering contraceptives to each household, and organizing a comprehensive examination of childbearing-age women every quarter.
    The cadres of Yangjiawu Village have been diligent in family planning work, focusing on both ideological work and technical guidance, thus achieving significant results. For 16 consecutive years, there have been no unplanned births.

    16年无计划外生育的山村
    我县茅山镇杨家窝铺村有5个村民小组，478口人，居住分散，管理不便。自1973年以来，党支部书记换了两届、妇女主任换了1届，但计划生育工作抓得始终如一。
    老支书张金奎在任时，让村里未婚和育龄青年逐个签订了晚婚晚育合同。二任支书李瑞发重点抓党员的带头作用。1987年全村实行了党员包户制度。
    今年上任的支书贾国栋，大抓优生优育提高人口素质的宣传工作。为解决群众居住分散、宣传不便的实际问题，由村投资购置设备，党员义务出工，按片于7月1日架起了8个高音喇叭。
    在计划生育工作中，这个村的妇女主任发挥了很大作用。管了12年计划生育工作的前村妇女主任于爱风，对育龄妇女情况了如指掌，谁家的避孕药用完了，她准时给送去……
    现任妇女主任苏小华，坚持每月挨户进行月经访视，送药具上门，每季组织一次育龄妇女集中普查。
    杨家窝铺村的干部抓计划生育，既做人的思想工作，又重视技术指导，因而工作很有成效，连续16年无计划外生育。
