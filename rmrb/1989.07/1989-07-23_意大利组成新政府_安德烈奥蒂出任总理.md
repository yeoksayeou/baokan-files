Italy Forms New Government, Andreotti Takes Office as Prime Minister

	BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The 49th government of the Italian Republic, led by Giulio Andreotti as Prime Minister, has been officially formed.

	Yesterday afternoon, after meeting with President Francesco Cossiga, Andreotti announced the new government's lineup to the press. The new government took the oath of office this morning before President Cossiga. The 64-day government crisis has finally been resolved, marking the longest government crisis in Italy's post-war history without leading to early elections.

	The new government is still composed of a coalition of five parties: the Christian Democrats, the Socialist Party, the Republican Party, the Social Democrats, and the Liberal Party. Claudio Martelli, the deputy secretary of the Socialist Party, has been appointed as the deputy prime minister. Among the 30 ministers, the Christian Democrats have 14, the Socialist Party has 9, the Republican Party has 3, the Social Democrats have 2, and the Liberal Party has 2. The former deputy prime minister, Socialist Gianni De Michelis, has been appointed as the foreign minister, while Renato Ruggiero of the Socialist Party continues to serve as the minister of foreign trade. The defense minister is Minio Marti of the Christian Democrats.

	The new government's platform emphasizes the need for Italy to adapt to the goal of the 1992 European Single Market and to continue efforts to improve public finance.

    新政府的纲领强调要使意大利适应1992年欧洲统一大市场的目标，必须继续努力改善公共财政。
