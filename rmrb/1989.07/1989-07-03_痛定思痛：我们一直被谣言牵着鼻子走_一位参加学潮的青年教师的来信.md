We have been led astray by various rumors deliberately manufactured by some masterminds behind the scenes. At critical moments, rumors that could most effectively stir up students' emotions would emerge, leaving students with no choice but to follow the direction desired by the masterminds behind the scenes, believing it to be entirely voluntary. This is our tragic flaw.

In our fervor, we abandoned rational thinking, believing only in our own wishes and feelings, and unknowingly being led astray. For this, we have paid a heavy price.

I am a young teacher. Since the beginning of the student unrest in mid-April, I have been deeply involved. Looking back now, it feels like a nightmare. Regarding many issues that arose during the unrest, especially the widespread rumors, I had never engaged in calm, rational thinking due to being constantly in a state of fervor. Now, as I step out of my personal emotional circle, gain more understanding of the inside story, and return to reality, many previously unclear things have become clear, especially the role of rumors. I must admit that we have been led by the nose by various rumors deliberately manufactured by some masterminds behind the scenes. Over the past two months of twists and turns, at every critical moment, rumors that could most effectively stir up students' emotions would emerge, leaving students with no choice but to follow the direction desired by the masterminds behind the scenes, believing it to be entirely voluntary. This is our tragic flaw. I hope more people can understand these situations and see through the conspiracies of those masterminds behind the scenes.

On April 15, soon after Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away, someone deliberately portrayed Hu Yaobang as a fighter for democracy and freedom, claiming he was driven to death or even poisoned, making it sound as if they had witnessed it with their own eyes. In reality, we knew very little about Hu Yaobang. After being strongly influenced by big-character posters and rumors, our affection and regret for Hu Yaobang quickly turned into a sense of indignation. Soon, we forgot about Hu Yaobang and joined the so-called "democracy and freedom movement." We boarded a dangerous train without knowing its destination, so the unrest from the beginning was a result of some people using rumors to mobilize the masses.

On April 20, rumors spread in the school about the so-called "April 20 massacre," claiming that a female student from Beijing Normal University was run over by a police car, that blood flowed in front of Zhongnanhai, and that some students had their eyes gouged out by the police. These were supposedly witnessed by eyewitnesses, and we had no choice but to believe them. Thus, we were enraged and joined the April 21 evening protest march. Later, I gradually realized that the reason for the two incidents of storming Zhongnanhai was that someone wanted to use this to create a bloody conflict and then use the blood to mobilize the masses to achieve their goal of controlling the masses.

On the morning of April 22, we sat in Tiananmen Square, and someone said that Premier Li Peng had agreed to meet us at 12:45. We were full of hope, but this turned out to be another deception. Someone created this deception to hurt the students' self-respect and trust in the government, directly leading to the class boycott that followed on April 24.

On April 26, the People's Daily published an editorial. At that time, we did not carefully read this editorial. Rumors spread everywhere that the central government had labeled the students as rioters and would settle accounts with them one by one. Thus, we participated in the April 27 protest march, wanting to prove that we were not causing unrest. However, the facts did not develop as we imagined. The subsequent situation was unfortunately predicted by the April 26 editorial.

At this time, the illegal organization "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" was established, providing the masterminds behind the scenes with a frontline commander. From then on, a large number of rumors were fabricated and spread from here, becoming an important means for them to incite students and government opposition, further guiding the unrest to achieve their political goals.

In late April and early May, rumors spread everywhere that the government had no intention of dialogue, that the students who participated in the April 29 dialogue did not include members of the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation," and that the dialogue that day was rehearsed in advance, etc. In fact, Wu'erkaixi received an invitation to participate in the dialogue, but when he arrived at the National Students' Federation, he refused to attend the dialogue and instead made a statement to foreign journalists at the door, saying that the government did not allow him to participate. At that time, I and the people around me all believed this was true, so we were very dissatisfied with the government. The "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" also proposed extremely harsh, non-negotiable, and ultimatum-like dialogue conditions through the so-called dialogue delegation, which no government in any country could accept. Thus, the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" spread rumors everywhere that the government refused to dialogue and said that the peaceful petition method could no longer force the government to comply, and only through more radical hunger strikes could the goal be achieved. Thus, some students believed these lies and joined the hunger strike.

At the beginning of the hunger strike, not many people participated, but the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" said it was only a limited 36-hour hunger strike, but once someone participated, they could not withdraw. During the hunger strike, the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" destroyed the broadcasting facilities in the square and set up their own broadcasting station. They also set up several checkpoints to isolate us from the outside world. Thus, in the square, we had no other source of information except to listen to the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation's" broadcasts. The "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation's" broadcasts continuously spread various rumors, such as the "Twelve Gentlemen" were on a hunger strike with the students, some students had starved to death, some students had become vegetative, 10 million people were supporting them, etc. They also established a propaganda group to write various supportive articles, keeping our emotions constantly high. Some people wanted to withdraw, but they were threatened. Thus, many students were immersed in various rumors and, under various threats, could only endure the hardship in the square.

On the evening of May 19, we received the so-called "People's Daily Extra" in the square, calling for the people to go on strike. The "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" also announced the military's units and routes into the city, saying that the military was going to suppress the students. Therefore, we followed the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation's" orders and went to block the military vehicles. The "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" suddenly announced the end of the hunger strike on the evening of the 19th. Later, we found out that this was also done by the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" in advance, knowing that the government was going to impose martial law. The purpose was to create the impression that martial law was unnecessary and to incite people to resist the government, causing the situation to deteriorate.

From May 20, for several consecutive nights, we heard rumors that the troops were going to enter the square. The "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" spread rumors every night in various schools, inciting students to go to the square. At the same time, they constantly created a tense atmosphere in the square, using bamboo poles to hit paratroopers, using kites to block planes, using towels to prevent tear gas, and so on, constantly stimulating our nerves, making us unable to leave. Moreover, we heard various "absolutely reliable" messages, such as Deng Yingchao had retired from the party, workers from Shougang and Wuhan Iron and Steel had gone on strike, 30 departments including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced their separation from the "fake government," Shanghai had announced independence, etc. We also heard the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" calling for the overthrow of the current government. They claimed to have received reliable information that a new government had been established, with Zhao Ziyang acting as the chairman of the Military Commission, and Li Peng and Yang Shangkun had been removed from their posts. They called on people to fight for the victory of this struggle. It can be said that after martial law, the people's hearts in the square were maintained by the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation's" rumors.

On June 2, an accident occurred at Muxidi, and we did not know what happened. We only heard from the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" that the three unfortunate civilians who died were democratic fighters. They knew in advance that the troops were going to enter the city, and they were hit by a car while blocking the military vehicles. On June 3, the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" carried out counter-revolutionary incitement, stirring up people's hatred towards the government and inciting those who did not know the truth to block military vehicles and attack the troops. I also heard the broadcast in the square teaching people how to make and use Molotov cocktails. It can be said that their activities played a significant role in inciting the riot.

After the troops suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot, someone spread rumors that the "Tiananmen Square massacre" had occurred, saying that more than 3,000 people died in the square, that they saw with their own eyes a tank crushing 13 students from Tsinghua University, that martyr Chui Guozheng was killed because he shot three old women. Later, rumors spread that Comrade Deng Xiaoping had died, and there was infighting among the troops, etc., trying to create a confrontational atmosphere between the people and the government and inciting chaos throughout the country.

Over the past two months, the lessons we have learned are profound. We have always believed that the leadership of the Party and the socialist system is the only realistic choice at present. We only hope that through our actions, the Party and the government can better overcome various negative and corrupt phenomena. However, including the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" and those masterminds behind the scenes, their intentions are completely different from ours. They shout catchy slogans and wave moving flags, but what they do is to overthrow the government. Their main means is to use shameless rumors to fully stir up people's emotions. While we, in this fervor, abandoned rational thinking, believing only in our own wishes and feelings, unknowingly being led astray, and not realizing it at that time, this is how tragic it is. For this, we have paid a heavy price. This price will constantly remind our generation: at any time, do not blindly follow catchy slogans, and at any time, retain the right to judge right and wrong with our own minds.

    痛定思痛：我们一直被谣言牵着鼻子走
    ——一位参加学潮的青年教师的来信
    我们一直是被一些幕后策划者有意制造的种种谣言牵着鼻子走的。每到关键时刻，就会出现最能调动同学情绪的谣言，使同学们除了按照幕后策划者希望的方向走下去之外，别无其他选择，而且认为是完全自愿的，这正是我们的可悲之处。
    我们在狂热的情绪中放弃了理智的思考，只相信自己的愿望和感觉，自觉不自觉地被人引向歧途。为此，我们付出了沉重的代价。
    我是一名青年教师。从4月中旬学潮开始以来，一直置身其中。现在回想起来，如同作了一场噩梦。对于学潮以至动乱中出现的很多问题，特别是对一些广为流传的谣言，由于经常处在狂热的情绪之中，从未做过冷静、理智的思考。现在，当我跳出个人情绪的小圈子，当我对事情的内幕有了更多的了解，当我重新回到现实之中的时候，以前很多不明白的事情就变得清晰起来了，特别是对谣言的作用看得更清楚了。我必须承认，我们一直是被一些幕后策划者有意制造的种种谣言牵着鼻子走的。这两个月的曲曲折折，风风波波，每到关键的时候，就会出现最能调动同学情绪的谣言，使同学们除了按照幕后策划者希望的方向走下去以外，别无其他选择，而且认为是完全自愿的，这正是我们的可悲之处。我希望能有更多的人了解到这些情况，看清那些幕后策划者的阴谋。
    4月15日胡耀邦同志刚一去世，就有人故意把胡耀邦同志渲染成一个民主自由的斗士，并说他是被活活气死的，有的还说他是被毒死的，说得活灵活现，如同亲眼目睹。其实，我们对胡耀邦同志了解并不多。经过那些大字报和谣言的强烈渲染，我们对耀邦同志的好感和惋惜便立刻上升为一种悲愤。很快又忘掉了耀邦，参加到所谓的“民主自由运动”之中。糊里糊涂地搭上了一列只有驾车人才知道目的地的危险的火车，所以，学潮在一开始就是有些人利用谣言动员群众的必然结果。
    4月20日，在学校中盛传发生了所谓的“四·二○”血案，说师大一女同学被警车轧死了，说在新华门前血流遍地，还说有的同学的眼珠被警察打出来了，而且都是目击者亲眼所见，我们不能不信。于是我们被激怒了，再次走进了4月21日晚的游行队伍之中。后来，我才慢慢地明白过来，之所以出现两次冲击新华门的事件，就是有人想借此制造流血冲突，然后以鲜血去动员群众，以达到他们操纵群众的目的。
    4月22日上午，我们在天安门广场静坐，又有人说李鹏总理已答应在12：45出来见我们。我们满怀希望，谁知这又是一个骗局，有人制造这个骗局来伤害同学的自尊心，破坏同学对政府的信任，直接导致了4月24日以后的罢课。
    4月26日，《人民日报》发表了社论，我们当时并没有仔细阅读这篇社论，到处都在传说中央已经把学生定为动乱分子，要逐个算帐，于是我们参加了4月27日的游行，想证明我们不是在搞动乱。可事实的发展并不像我们所想象的那样，后来的事态被4月26日的社论不幸而言中。
    在这个时候，非法组织“高自联”宣布成立，动乱的幕后策划者有了前台总指挥。到此，大量的谣言从这里炮制并抛出，成了他们煽动学生和政府的对立情绪，进一步引导动乱达到他们政治目的的重要手段。
    4月下旬和5月上旬，到处都在宣传所谓政府没有对话诚意的谣言，说是4月29日对话的同学中没有“高自联”的人，那天的对话是经过事先排演的等等。事实上，吾尔开希接到了参加对话会的邀请，到了全国学联又拒绝出席对话会，却向门口的外国记者发表谈话，说政府不让他参加。当时我和我周围的人都相信这是真的，因此对政府非常不满。“高自联”还通过所谓对话代表团提出了苛刻的、毫无妥协余地的、最后通牒式的对话条件，这些条件是在任何一个国家的政府都不能接受的。于是，“高自联”到处宣传政府拒绝对话，并说和平请愿的方式已不能逼政府就范，只有通过更激烈的绝食方式，才能达到目的。于是，一些同学相信了这些谎言，走进了绝食的队伍。
    绝食开始时，并没有很多人参加，但“高自联”说只举行36小时的有限绝食，可只要一参加进去，就谁也不能再退出来了。在绝食期间，“高自联”破坏了广场的播音设施，自己架设了广播站。又设立数道纠察线使我们与外界隔绝。这样，我们在广场上除了收听“高自联”的广播再无其他消息来源。“高自联”的广播连篇累牍地散布各种谣言，什么十二君子与同学一起绝食，什么已有同学饿死，什么已有6个同学成为植物人，什么1000万人声援。他们还成立了一个宣传组，专门编写各种声援的稿件，使得我们的情绪总处在亢奋之中。有的人想退出来，也受到了人身威胁。这样，很多同学沉迷于各种谣言之中，又迫于各种威胁的压力下，只能在广场上苦苦支撑着。
    5月19日晚，我们在广场上得到了所谓的《人民日报》号外，号召群众罢工罢市。“高自联”又公布了军队的番号、进城的路线，说军队要镇压学生，因此我们听从了“高自联”的指挥，都去堵军车。“高自联”又突然在19日晚宣布停止绝食，后来我们才知道，这也是“高自联”在事先知道政府要戒严的情况下故意这么做的，目的就是为了给人们造成政府戒严没有必要的印象，极力煽动人们去反抗政府，促使事态不断恶化。
    从5月20日开始，连续几天晚上我们都听到部队要进入广场的谣言。“高自联”天天晚上到各校造谣，鼓动学生都到广场去。同时，他们又在广场上不断制造紧张空气，又是发竹竿来打空降兵，又是放风筝挡飞机，又是发毛巾防催泪弹，折腾得不亦乐乎，不断刺激着我们的神经，使我们无法离去。而且我们还听到各种“绝对可靠”的消息，说邓颖超已退党，说首钢、武钢工人已罢工，说外交部等30个部委已宣布脱离“伪政府”，说上海市已宣布独立等等。我们还听到“高自联”在号召人们推翻现政府，他们宣称已得到确切消息，说新政府已成立，赵紫阳代理军委主席，李鹏、杨尚昆已下台，号召人们去争取这场斗争的胜利。可以说，戒严以后，广场上的人心都是靠“高自联”的谣言维系的。
    6月2日，在木樨地发生了一起车祸，我们并不知道是怎么回事，只是听“高自联”说不幸遇难的三位市民都是民主战士，他们事先知道了部队进城的意图，为了延缓部队进城时间，拦军车而被撞死的。6月3日，“高自联”大肆进行反革命煽动，极力挑动人们对政府的仇恨，鼓动不明真相的人堵截军车，袭击部队，我还听到广场的广播中教人们如何制造和使用燃烧瓶，可以说他们的活动对于暴乱的发生起了极大的煽动作用。
    在部队镇压了反革命暴乱之后，又有人造谣“血洗了天安门广场”，说广场上死了3000多人，说亲眼看见坦克车轧死13个清华的学生，说崔国政烈士是因为开枪打死三个老太太才被害的。后来又谣传邓小平同志已去世，部队之间发生了火并等，极力制造人民与政府的对抗情绪，而且到全国各地到处煽动，企图通过谣言使全国陷于混乱之中。
    这两个多月来，对我们来说教训太深刻了。我们一直相信党的领导和社会主义制度是当前唯一现实的选择。我们只是希望通过我们的行动促进党和政府更好地克服各种消极腐败现象。可是，包括“高自联”在内的那些幕后策划者与我们想的完全是两回事，他们喊的是动听的口号，举的是动人的旗帜，干的却是颠覆政府的勾当，其主要手段就是通过无耻的谣言，充分调动着人们的情绪，而我们则在这种狂热的情绪中放弃了理智的思考，只相信自己的愿望和感觉，自觉不自觉地被人引向歧路，而且当时还不自知，这是多么可悲。为此，我们付出了沉重的代价。这种代价将会不断地提醒我们这一代人：在任何时候都不要盲从于动听的口号，在任何时候，都要保留用自己的头脑去判断是非的权利。
