	Grain procurement progresses smoothly despite some delays
	Nationwide summer grain procurement is progressing smoothly

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28th (reporter Chen Yun): Vice Minister of the Ministry of Commerce He Jihai reported to the capital's news media today that by July 25th, the nationwide summer grain contract procurement task has been completed by 87.6%. There have been no significant instances of "white receipts" during the procurement process. However, due to heavy rains during the harvest in some regions, some wheat has sprouted, leading to a slower procurement and storage pace compared to last year.

	According to the latest statistics from the Ministry of Commerce today, the state's contracted summer grain procurement has reached 12.043 million tons by July 25th. Among the 13 provinces and municipalities with summer grain contract procurement tasks, Beijing was the first to complete its task, while Hebei, Zhejiang, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces have also exceeded their procurement targets. Shandong and Sichuan provinces have completed over 95% of their tasks, and other provinces are continuing to accelerate their storage progress.

	He Jihai highly praised the patriotic actions of the broad masses of farmers who, despite a significant price difference in the market, have enthusiastically sold grain to the state.

	He said that during this summer grain harvest period, provinces such as Jiangsu, Anhui, and Hubei experienced continuous high temperatures and rain, making it difficult to dry the harvested grain in time. Some wheat has sprouted, affecting the procurement and storage progress.

	To consider the interests of the farmers, these regions have appropriately relaxed the quality requirements for grain procurement, trying to purchase as much as possible.

    入库进度因部分麦子发芽慢于去年
    全国夏粮收购进展顺利
    据新华社北京7月28日电  （记者陈芸）商业部副部长何济海今天向首都新闻界通报说，到7月25日止，全国夏粮合同定购任务已完成87.6％，收购中基本没有出现打
  “白条”现象。但由于部分地区收获时阴雨成灾，部分麦子发芽，丰产未能丰收，使得今年的收购入库进度慢于去年。
    据商业部今天的最新统计，国家合同定购的夏粮到25日已收购入库1204.3万吨。在13个有夏粮合同定购任务的省市中，北京第一个完成了任务，河北、浙江、河南、陕西等省也陆续超额完成定购任务；山东、四川等省已经完成任务的95％以上，其它省也在继续加快入库的进度。
    何济海高度赞扬了广大农民在牌市差价相差1倍的情况下，踊跃向国家交粮的爱国行动。
    他说，今年夏粮收获期间，江苏、安徽、湖北等省持续高温阴雨，收获后的粮食得不到及时晾晒，部分麦子发芽，影响了收购入库进度。
    为照顾农民的利益，这些地区已适当放宽了粮食收购的质量要求，尽量多收一些。
