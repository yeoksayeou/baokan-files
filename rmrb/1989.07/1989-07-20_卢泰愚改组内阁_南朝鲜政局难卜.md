Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 20th.

South Korean President Roh Tae-woo announced a cabinet reshuffle in Seoul on July 19. Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon remains in his post, while six ministers have been replaced.

According to the South Korean Broadcasting System, Roh Tae-woo appointed Prosecutor General Seo Dong-gwon as the head of the National Security Planning Agency, Democratic Justice Party lawmaker Kim Tae-ho as the head of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Housing Corporation president Kwon Yeong-gak as the head of the Ministry of Construction, former Democratic Justice Party lawmaker Kim Jong-in as the head of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, former Korea Telecommunications Corporation president Lee Yu-jin as the head of the Ministry of Communications. Former Minister of Communications Choi Yong-jak has been reassigned as the head of the Ministry of Labor. The position of the First Deputy Prime Minister will be filled by Presidential Policy Advisor Park Jeol-hyeon.

The most notable change in this cabinet reshuffle is the replacement of the head of the National Security Planning Agency. Since March, when South Korean pastor Mun Ik-hwan visited North Korea without authorization, the South Korean authorities have intensified their persecution of those advocating for Korean reunification, drawing attention from various sectors of South Korean society. Recently, after it was revealed that Peace Democratic Party lawmaker Seo Gyeong-won had secretly visited Pyongyang last year, the authorities accused the National Security Planning Agency of negligence. The replacement of the head of the National Security Planning Agency aims to strengthen control over opposition figures visiting the North, eliminate the resulting "social unrest," and achieve a "unified" South-North dialogue led by the authorities.

A spokesman for the Peace Democratic Party believes that Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon's retention and the entry of former President Chun Doo-hwan's supporters into the cabinet make the future of South Korean politics uncertain. A spokesman for the Democratic Party expressed regret that Roh Tae-woo did not replace Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon and hold him accountable for the "failure of economic policies."

### 卢泰愚改组内阁  南朝鲜政局难卜

    卢泰愚改组内阁  南朝鲜政局难卜
    新华社平壤7月20日电  南朝鲜总统卢泰愚7月19日在汉城宣布改组南朝鲜内阁。总理姜英勋留任，有6名部长更换。
    据南朝鲜广播电台报道，卢泰愚任命检察总长徐东权为国家安全企划部长官、民正党国会议员金泰镐为内政部长官、住宅公社社长权宁觉为建设部长官、前民正党议员金钟仁为保健社会部长官、前电气通讯公社社长李佑在为递信部长。原递信部长崔永喆改任劳动部长。第一政部长官由总统政策助理朴哲彦担任。
    南朝鲜此次改组内阁最引人注目的是更换安全企划部长官。今年3月，南朝鲜牧师文益焕未经批准访问朝鲜北方以来，南朝鲜当局加紧了对向往朝鲜和平统一的人士的迫害，引起南朝鲜各界的关注。不久前，平民党国会议员徐敬元去年秘密访问平壤一事见诸报端后，当局指责安全企划部失职。南朝鲜更换安全企划部长官旨在加强控制在野人士访问北方，消除由此产生的“社会环境不安”，实现南北对话由当局主导的“一元化”。
    平民党发言人认为，总理姜英勋留任和前总统全斗焕的支持者进入内阁，使南朝鲜政局前景难卜。民主党发言人对卢泰愚没有撤换总理姜英勋和追究“经济政策的失败”表示遗憾。
