    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10th.

    A favorable situation has emerged in the rule of law for water management, with a batch of water disputes, including those over the Zhang River, being resolved. The Zhang River water dispute, which has persisted for over 30 years, has recently been resolved with a solution approved by the State Council and is being implemented by the provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan. Similar cross-regional water disputes have seen 8 cases resolved or have had resolution plans formulated nationwide since the implementation of the Water Law a year ago.

    Water disputes have long been a major concern for relevant regions and people, often leading to the destruction of water facilities, resulting in unnecessary waste of manpower, material resources, and finances, and even causing fights and brawls. Over the years, through local negotiations, some disputes have been resolved. However, due to the lack of legal basis, some disputes have dragged on for decades without resolution.

    Since the implementation of the Water Law, the situation has improved significantly. The Ministry of Water Resources and local authorities, in accordance with legal provisions, have worked with all parties involved in the disputes to propose resolution plans. Once an agreement is reached, it is firmly executed. After the Zhang River water allocation plan was approved by the State Council, the relevant regions in Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan have taken measures to implement the decisions, shifting from long-term water disputes to water conservation, making the best use of water within their allocated quotas. Areas like Wuxi have long been threatened by floods. Jiangsu Province planned to build a sluice gate at the Niushan mouth of Taihu Lake, but this was delayed for a long time due to concerns about downstream water flow affecting parts of Zhejiang Province. Through negotiations facilitated by the Ministry of Water Resources with relevant departments in both provinces, an agreement to build the sluice gate has now been reached.

    依法治水出现可喜局面
    漳河等一批水事纠纷得到解决
    本报讯　记者肖俊熙报道：延续30余年的漳河水事纠纷，最近经国务院批准了解决方案，正由晋、冀、豫三省实施。像这类跨地区的水事纠纷，自《水法》实施一年来，全国有8起已解决，或已制定出了解决方案。依法治水出现了可喜的局面。
    水事纠纷是困扰有关地区和人民的大事，常常导致水利设施遭破坏，带来不应有的人财物力的巨大浪费，甚至引起打架斗殴。多年来，经各地协商，有些纠纷得到解决，但因无法可依，也有一些纠纷拖延数十年未决。
    《水法》实施后，情况大为改观。水利部和各地主管部门依照法律规定，会同有纠纷的各方提出解决方案，一形成协议就坚定执行。漳河分水方案经国务院批准后，晋、冀、豫三省有关地区采取措施落实各项决定，由长期争水转向节约用水，使各自份额内的水量发挥最佳效益。无锡市等地一直受洪水威胁，江苏省拟在太湖犊山口建闸，因下泄水流危及浙江省部分地区而长期未决。经水利部会同两省有关部门协商，目前已达成建闸协议。
