Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, attended a discussion with all comrades attending the third enlarged meeting of the eleventh National Federation of Trade Unions Chairman's Council this afternoon. He emphasized that we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class and fully utilize the role of trade union organizations.

Millions of people, including Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan, attended the meeting.

New China News Agency, Beijing, July 26th – (Reporter: He Ping) This afternoon, Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, attended a discussion with all comrades attending the third enlarged meeting of the eleventh National Federation of Trade Unions Chairman's Council. He pointed out that the Constitution of our country clearly stipulates: The People's Republic of China is a socialist state under the leadership of the working class and based on the alliance of workers and peasants. Therefore, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class.

Jiang Zemin said that undoubtedly, intellectuals are also part of the working class. We must particularly emphasize the role of industrial workers as the backbone. The facts of this suppression of turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion once again show that the working class is completely reliable.

The meeting was held in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai.

Other leaders attending the discussion included Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, Ding Guangen, and Wen Jiabao.

The discussion was chaired by Nie Rongzhen, the Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions.

At the meeting, Jiang Zemin expressed his views on the role of the working class as masters of the country and on trade union work.

At the meeting, Shang Baokun, Chairman of the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions, Pan Yiqing, Chairman of the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions, Jiang Rong, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, Xue Zhaofu, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Federation of Trade Unions, Li Meifang, Chairman of the Wuhan Federation of Trade Unions, Wang Wenyi, Chairman of the Shenyang Federation of Trade Unions, and Guan Hengcai, Director of the National Defense Federation of Trade Unions, spoke successively.

The seven comrades pointed out in their speeches that the recent reiteration by the Party Central Committee that we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class and give full play to their role as the main force is of great importance. The facts have proven that the working class is not only the main force in construction and reform but also the main force in maintaining stability and unity.

They believed in their speeches that trade union organizations should become a bridge and link between the Party and the government and the broad masses of workers. Under the leadership of the Party, they should independently and autonomously carry out work according to their own nature and characteristics, actively participate in politics and policy-making, and genuinely reflect the feelings, voices, opinions, and demands of the broad masses of workers, playing their due role in the construction of socialist democratic politics.

In their speeches, they also hoped that relevant regulations would be formulated and improved as soon as possible to gradually bring trade union work into the track of legalization.

Jiang Zemin said in discussing trade union work that the Party is the vanguard of the working class, and trade unions are mass organizations of the broad masses of workers. Therefore, trade union organizations must carry out activities under the unified leadership of the Party, but at the same time, they must independently and autonomously carry out work according to the trade union charter, genuinely represent the interests of workers, fully reflect the opinions and voices of workers, actively participate in politics and policy-making, and make trade unions a channel for promoting democracy. Moreover, trade unions should also become a great school of communism for educating the broad masses of workers, vigorously carrying out socialist, patriotic, and hard-working education, and preventing and overcoming the influence of bourgeois liberalization. He hoped that trade union work would continue to implement the series of lines, policies, and principles of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, implement the spirit of the Eleventh Trade Union Congress, and carry out work according to the requirements of this Chairman's Council meeting.

Jiang Zemin also mentioned that the current issue of unfair social distribution is a factor affecting the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers, so this issue must be well resolved. At the same time, we must continue to overcome egalitarianism and truly implement and embody the principle of socialist distribution according to work.

During the discussion, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, and other comrades also made speeches or interjections. (Accompanied by a picture)

    江泽民同出席全总主席团扩大会议同志座谈
    全心全意依靠工人阶级　充分发挥工会组织作用
    万里乔石姚依林宋平李瑞环等领导同志出席
    新华社北京7月26日电　（记者何平）中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在同出席全国总工会十一届三次主席团扩大会议的全体同志座谈时指出，我国宪法中明确规定：中华人民共和国是工人阶级领导的、以工农联盟为基础的人民民主专政的社会主义国家。因此，我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级。
    江泽民说，毫无疑问，知识分子也是工人阶级的一部分。我们尤其要重视发挥产业工人的骨干作用。这次制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的事实再次表明：工人阶级是完全可以信赖的。
    座谈会在中南海怀仁堂举行。
    出席座谈的领导同志还有：万里、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环、丁关根、温家宝。
    座谈会由全国总工会主席倪志福主持。
    会上，江泽民同志就工人阶级的主人翁地位、工会工作等问题发表了意见。
    座谈会上，北京市总工会主席商保坤、天津市总工会主席潘义清、上海市总工会主席江荣、陕西省总工会主席薛昭鋆、武汉市总工会主席李梅芳、沈阳市总工会主席王文毅、中国国防工会主任关恒才先后发了言。
    这七位同志在发言中指出，党中央最近再次重申强调了必须全心全意依靠工人阶级，发挥他们的主力军作用，十分重要，广大职工深受鼓舞。事实证明，工人阶级不仅是建设和改革的主力军，也是维护安定团结的主力军。
    他们在发言中认为，工会组织应成为党和政府联系广大职工群众的桥梁、纽带，在党的领导下根据自身的性质和特点独立自主地开展工作，积极参政议政，切实反映广大职工的情绪、呼声、意见、要求，在社会主义民主政治的建设中发挥应有作用。
    在发言中他们还希望，尽快制定、完善有关的法规，使工会工作逐步纳入法制化轨道。
    江泽民在谈到工会工作时说，党是工人阶级的先锋队，工会是广大职工的群众性组织。因此，工会组织必须在党的统一领导下进行活动，但同时又要按照工会章程，独立自主地开展工作，切实代表工人利益，充分反映工人的意见和呼声，积极参政议政，使工会成为发扬民主的一个渠道。不仅如此，工会还应成为对广大职工进行思想教育的共产主义大学校，大力开展社会主义、爱国主义和艰苦奋斗的教育，阻止和克服资产阶级自由化思潮的影响。他希望工会工作要继续贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的一系列路线、方针、政策，落实工会“十一”大精神，按照这次全总主席团会议提出的要求开展工作。
    江泽民还谈到，当前社会分配不公问题，是影响广大职工群众积极性的一个因素，因此，这个问题一定要很好地加以解决。但同时，我们还要继续克服平均主义，真正贯彻、体现社会主义按劳分配的原则。
    座谈时，乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环等同志，也作了讲话或插话。（附图片）
