The results of the third national forest resource survey, which took five years (1984–1988), show that China currently has 267.43 million hectares of forest land (equivalent to 4.011 billion mu); 124.65 million hectares of forest (equivalent to 1.869 billion mu); a forest coverage rate of 12.98%; a total stock volume of living trees of 10.572 billion cubic meters; and a forest stock volume of 9.141 billion cubic meters.

Compared with the previous survey (1977–1981), the overall trend in forest resources is as follows: the forest area has increased, the forest stock volume has continued to decrease, and the forest quality has declined. The specific situation is as follows:

The national forest area has increased by 5.88 million hectares, and the forest coverage rate has increased by 0.98% compared to the previously published figures. Currently, China has reversed the trend of decreasing forest area, and the area of artificial forests ranks first in the world. At the same time, due to excessive logging and unreasonable consumption, the area of timber forests has decreased by 2.8472 million hectares. Among them, the area of mature and over-mature forests has decreased more significantly, with a total reduction of one-third over 7 years, amounting to 7.69 million hectares.

The forest stock volume continues to decline. In particular, the stock volume of mature and over-mature forests in timber forests has decreased significantly, with one-third of the original stock volume consumed in 7 years. The annual deficit logging is 1.7 billion cubic meters. After deducting Tibet and other areas that are not suitable for development and utilization or are inaccessible, the stock volume of mature and over-mature forests in the existing timber forests is at most 14 billion to 51 billion cubic meters available for logging. If the current consumption level is maintained, it will only be possible to log for 7 to 8 years. At that time, most state-owned forestry enterprises will have no mature or over-mature forests to log.

The materials published by the Ministry of Forestry also analyze the trends in forest resources: the situation of annual consumption exceeding annual production is becoming increasingly serious, especially in timber forests, where the annual consumption exceeds the growth by 0.97 billion cubic meters.

*	Mature and over-mature forest resources are on the verge of exhaustion, and the replenishment resources of near-mature forests are very insufficient. In the future, when there are no mature or over-mature forests to log, it will inevitably be necessary to consume a large amount of near-mature and middle-aged forests, and the trend of slowly increasing forest coverage will be reversed.
*	The stock volume per unit area of forest land continues to decline.
*	Although the area of artificial forests has increased significantly, the survival rate and preservation rate of afforestation are not high.
*	A large amount of forest land has been encroached upon, seriously affecting the protection of forest resources and the development of forestry.

Minister of Forestry Gao Dezhan introduced that this survey, except for the Tibet Autonomous Region, which still uses the data from the previous survey, and Taiwan Province, which uses the data published in 1977, the other 29 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have conducted thorough surveys. More than 150,000 people participated in this work, and the state and local governments provided strong financial support. The survey used the most effective "continuous forest resource survey method" recognized by the international community at the time, that is, based on mathematical statistics principles, using systematic sampling methods, obtaining a large amount of data from more than 255,000 survey sample plots, and processing it through computers to obtain the results of the national forest resource survey. The Ministry of Forestry organized more than ten forestry experts to review the results of this survey. Experts unanimously agreed that the survey method is scientific, the data obtained is reliable, and it has reached the world level of the 1980s.

Gao Dezhan emphasized that this survey shows that China's forest resource crisis is becoming increasingly severe, and it is urgent to address this problem. He called on all sectors of society to further care about, support, and truly achieve the goal of the whole society engaging in forestry, the whole people participating in greening, strengthening management and logging less, raising funds and planting more trees, and quickly reversing the severe situation of China's forest resource crisis.

### 我国第三次森林资源清查结果表明  森林面积增加蓄积量下降  林业部长呼吁全社会办林业尽快扭转资源危机局面

    我国第三次森林资源清查结果表明
    森林面积增加蓄积量下降
    林业部长呼吁全社会办林业尽快扭转资源危机局面
    本报北京7月26日讯　记者吴长生报道：历时5年（1984—1988年）的第三次全国森林资源清查资料表明：我国目前林业用地面积为26743万公顷（折合40.11亿亩）；森林面积为12465万公顷（折合18.69亿亩）；森林覆盖率为12.98％；活立木总蓄积量为105.72亿立方米；森林蓄积量为91.41亿立方米。
    与上次（1977—1981年）清查相比，森林资源变化的总趋势是：森林面积有所增加，森林蓄积量持续减少，森林质量下降，具体情况如下：
    全国森林面积增加588万多公顷，森林覆盖率比上次公布的数字提高0.98％。目前我国已扭转了森林面积下降的趋势，人工林保存面积占世界第一位。与此同时，由于过量采伐和不合理消耗，用材林面积却减少了284.72万公顷。其中成熟林和过熟林面积减少幅度更大，7年多间共减少总量的1／3，计769万公顷。
    森林蓄积量持续下降。尤其是用材林中的成熟林和过熟林蓄积量大幅度下降，7年多时间消耗掉原有量的1／3，年均赤字采伐1.7亿立方米。扣除西藏及其他不宜开发利用和不可及部分，现有用材林中的成过熟林蓄积量最多只有14亿至51亿立方米可供采伐。若按目前的消耗水平推算，只能采伐7至8年，届时，绝大多数国营森工企业将无成过熟林可采。
    林业部公布的材料还分析了森林资源的变化趋势：年消耗量超过年生产量的状况越来越严重，尤其是用材林，年消耗量竟超过生长量0.97亿立方米。
    ——成熟林和过熟林资源濒于枯竭，而近熟林的接续资源又很不充足。将来成过熟林无资源可采后，势必被迫大量消耗近熟林和中龄林，森林覆盖率缓慢上升趋势将发生逆转。
    ——林地单位面积蓄积量持续下降。
    ——人工林面积虽有较多增加，但造林成活率和保存率不高。
    ——大量林地被侵占，已严重影响到森林资源保护和林业发展。
    林业部长高德占介绍，这次清查除西藏自治区仍沿用上次清查的数据，台湾省引用1977年公布的数据外，其他29个省、自治区、直辖市都进行了认真清查。共有1.5万多人参加了这项工作，国家和地方在财力方面给予了大力支持。清查采用当前国际公认最有效的
  “森林资源连续清查方法”，即依据数理统计原理，用系统抽样的方法，从25.5万多个调查样地取得大量数据，通过计算机处理，获得全国森林资源清查成果。林业部组织十多位林业专家对这次清查成果进行评审。专家一致认为这次清查方法是科学的，取得的数据可靠，达到了80年代世界水平。
    高德占强调，这次清查表明，我国森林资源危机日益加剧，下狠心解决这一问题已刻不容缓。他呼吁社会各界进一步关心林业，支持林业，真正做到全社会办林业，全民搞绿化，强化管理少砍树，广筹资金多造林，尽快扭转我国森林资源危机的严峻局面。
