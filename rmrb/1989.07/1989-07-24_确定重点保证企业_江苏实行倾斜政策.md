Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 24th — (Reporters Yang Fudian and Fei Qiang) Jiangsu Province has recently designated 550 industrial and mining enterprises as key enterprises to be prioritized, and will implement preferential policies in terms of resources, funds, and other aspects.

This year, despite the slowing growth rate of industrial production in Jiangsu, the supply of key production factors such as funds, energy, and raw materials remains tight. Particularly, large and medium-sized enterprises are facing significant challenges. To address this, the industrial leadership departments of Jiangsu Province, after conducting investigations, research, and extensive consultations with relevant departments and regions, have categorized 140 major industrial products into four classes: must be guaranteed, priority guaranteed, restricted production, and prohibited production. Enterprises producing must-guarantee and priority-guarantee products, especially large and medium-sized ones, have been designated as key enterprises to be prioritized. It is understood that among the 550 key enterprises that have been designated, approximately two-thirds are large and medium-sized enterprises.

    确定重点保证企业  江苏实行倾斜政策
    据新华社南京7月24日电　（记者杨福田、费强）江苏省新近确定550个工矿企业为重点保证企业，并将在资源、资金等方面对它们实行倾斜政策。
    今年以来，江苏工业生产在增长速度减缓的情况下，资金、能源、原材料等主要生产要素仍然紧张。特别是一些大中型企业困难较大。为此，江苏省工业领导部门在调查研究并与有关部门、地区充分协商的基础上，根据产品的重要程度、生产水平、市场情况和能源、资金、原材料供应能力，把140种主要工业产品划分为必须保证、优先保证、限制生产和禁止生产四类。对生产必保和优先保证产品的企业，特别是其中的大中型企业，确定为重点保证对象。据了解，在已确定的550个重点保证企业中，约2／3是大中型企业。
