The Tianjin Railway Bureau's Technical Development Corporation, following the establishment of the nation's first railway-farmer joint venture storage and transportation yard near Tianjin Port, has subsequently set up six joint railway-enterprise storage and transportation companies in the Bohai Gulf region.

It is understood that these yards handled 1.58 million tons of goods in the first half of this year, generating a profit of over 6.1 million yuan. This has alleviated the problem of insufficient cargo storage and transportation capacity at railways and ports, thereby reducing the burden on the railways.
