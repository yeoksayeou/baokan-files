In recent years, the theft of agricultural power equipment in the rural areas of Huaihua City has been very serious. Since last July, seven townships including Luyang, Huajiao, Xiaping, Niejiacun, Xinjian, Yingkou, and Yuanjia have reported 110 cases of power equipment theft. Among these, 11 cases involved the theft of electric motors, totaling 18 units, with direct economic losses amounting to over 9,800 yuan. Three cases involved the theft of agricultural irrigation electric switches, and 91 cases involved the theft of high-voltage lines, totaling 21,000 meters, with losses reaching 29,400 yuan.

During the drought relief period last year, the irrigation lines in Huangjia Mountain Village, Group 8 of Yingkou Township were stolen twice, damaging 300 mu of rice fields. The lines have not been repaired to this day. In the impoverished mountainous area of Yuanjia Township, the power lines for production and living in Yexing Village were cut by criminals last year, totaling over 1,000 meters. The entire village was without power for more than two months, causing great difficulties for the villagers' production and life. Villagers had to carry grain several kilometers away to be milled, and it was very inconvenient to walk at night. Later, everyone saved money and raised over 2,000 yuan to reinstall the power lines. The Yanziguan Coal Mine in Luyang Township had high-voltage lines stolen four times, totaling over 1,000 meters, causing several coal mines to stop production for a month, resulting in losses of over 100,000 yuan. On March 15 this year, eight electric motors were stolen from the paper mill in Yuanjia Township by criminals, causing direct economic losses of several thousand yuan. The mill has not been able to resume production to this day.

The reasons for the high incidence of such cases are:

First, law enforcement is lax, and crackdowns are ineffective. Many law enforcement officers do not consider these cases as crimes of damaging communication equipment. They only look at the amount of money involved in these cases, which does not meet the threshold for filing a theft case, and often only impose fines. Of the 32 cases solved in our city, only 9 were legally punished, while the rest were dealt with by fines.

Second, the police stations in townships lack manpower and are unable to promptly investigate and solve these theft cases. The Huajiao Township Police Station has only three contract police officers, two of whom are part-time. Since last July, 18 cases of power equipment theft have not been solved.

Third, there is no one specifically in charge of managing the power equipment. In some cases, thefts were not discovered and reported in time, leading to the destruction of the crime scene and difficulties in investigation.

Fourth, scrap collection points lack strict management. The operating departments only pursue economic benefits and accept anything, providing convenience for criminals to sell stolen goods. After the high-voltage lines in four groups of Yan Tou Village, Yingkou Township were stolen, villagers found the stolen high-voltage lines in the Red Star Road Waste Materials Company. When villagers and police from the township police station inquired about the origin of the high-voltage lines, the company manager ignored them.

We believe that these problems should be taken seriously by the relevant departments. The judicial and law enforcement agencies should concentrate their efforts to solve and punish a batch of cases involving the destruction of power equipment and punish criminals. At the same time, the scrap collection industry should be thoroughly rectified, and those who indiscriminately collect scrap should be appropriately punished. Those with serious offenses should be brought to justice.

### 湖南怀化市：  农用电力设备失窃严重

    湖南怀化市：
    农用电力设备失窃严重
    近年来，我市乡镇农用电力设备被盗现象十分严重。去年7月以来，泸阳、花桥镇、下坪、聂家村、新建、盈口、袁家等7个乡镇先后发生盗窃电力设备案110起，其中电动机被盗11起，共18台，直接经济损失达9800多元；农用排灌电动开关被盗3起；高压线被盗91起，总线长2.1万多米，损失金额达2.94万元。
    去年抗旱季节，盈口乡黄家山村八组的排灌线路两次被盗，使300亩稻田受损，线路至今无法修复。地处贫困山区的袁家乡野星村的生产、生活用电线路，去年被不法分子偷割了1000多米，全村停电两个多月，给村民生产、生活造成极大困难，村民只得挑谷到几公里外去碾米，晚上行走十分不便。后来，大家省吃俭用筹集了2000多元，重新架好电线。泸阳镇岩子园煤矿先后4次被盗高压线1000多米，造成几个煤窑停产一月之久，损失上万元。今年3月15日，袁家乡造纸厂被不法分子盗走8台电动机，直接经济损失数千元。这个厂至今未能恢复生产。
    造成这类案件多发的原因是：
    一、执法不严，打击不力。不少执法人员认为，没有把这类案件看成是破坏通信设备犯罪，只从这类案件的犯罪金额达不到盗窃犯罪的立案标准，往往只作罚款处理。我市已破获的32起案件，依法惩处的只有9起，其他的罚款了事。
    二、乡镇公安派出所警力不足，无力及时侦破这类偷盗案件。花桥镇公安派出所仅有3名合同制民警，其中两名是兼职的。去年7月以来，18起电力设备盗案，至今未破。
    三、电力设备无专人管理，有些偷盗案件发生后，未能及时发现报案，使现场受到破坏，给侦破工作带来困难。
    四、废品收购点没有严格的管理制度，经营部门单纯追求经济效益，见物就收，为犯罪分子销赃提供了方便。盈口乡岩头村4个组的高压线被盗后，村民在红星路地区废旧物资公司找到被盗的高压线，当村民和乡公安派出所同志询问高压线来历时，公司经理不予理睬。
    我们认为，这些问题应引起有关部门的重视。政法机关应集中力量，侦破查处一批破坏电力设备的案件，惩治不法分子。同时，应全面整顿废旧品收购行业，对乱收购者应酌情予以处罚，情节严重的应绳之以法。
