	Step-by-Step Implementation Yields Initial Results: Liaoning Actively Executes National Industrial Policies

	Our reporter, Lu Mu, learned from the State Planning Commission that Liaoning Province has adopted a step-by-step approach to implement the national industrial policy, with noticeable effects.

	Liaoning, the largest heavy industrial base in China, has a long-standing industrial structure that is heavily tilted towards heavy industries, with agriculture and light industries being relatively weak. As a result, the province has to import large quantities of grain, oil, meat, eggs, and other agricultural and light industrial products annually. Additionally, due to the high proportion of energy-intensive industries, the energy supply situation has become even more tense, leading to a significant portion of the province's production capacity being idle. Furthermore, there are issues such as outdated industrial technology and irrational regional distribution, all of which constrain the province's economic development. The province believes that all these issues need to be gradually addressed through the implementation of national industrial policies and the adjustment of the industrial structure.

	Since the second quarter, the province has first corrected the previously proposed industrial and product development research opinions based on the national industrial policy and has begun drafting the "Opinions on Adjusting the Industrial and Product Structure" for the entire province. At the same time, in accordance with the national industrial policy orientation, the province has proposed the "Suggestions on the Near-Term Investment Directions," to guide this year's fixed asset investment activities. The "Suggestions" clearly require that investment priorities be placed on industries supported by the national industrial policy.

	From the perspective of adjusting the product structure, the role of the national industrial policy has begun to emerge in Liaoning. In the first quarter, due to power shortages, the growth rate of heavy industry was small, and some products did not meet the national plan, significantly affecting fiscal revenue. Entering the second quarter, according to the national industrial policy, measures were taken to tilt the allocation of electricity and funds, resulting in a rebound in the production of raw material industries. Large enterprises like Anshan Steel reversed the trend of three consecutive months of negative growth. The province's steel product structure has been adjusted, with the proportion of plates, tubes, and strips increasing by 1.36% in the first half of the year compared to the same period last year. Market-tight, short-line products, and agricultural support products grew rapidly, increasing effective supply and promoting currency circulation.

	To fully implement the national industrial policy, Liaoning has drafted the initial implementation measures for the "Decision of the State Council on the Key Points of the Current Industrial Policy." Currently, the Provincial Commission of Economy and Planning is actively coordinating the opinions of various industry management departments and is in close consultation with relevant economic comprehensive management departments to quickly formulate the province's current industrial structure and product structure adjustment opinions.

### 先易后难  分步实施  初见成效  辽宁积极执行国家产业政策

    先易后难  分步实施  初见成效
    辽宁积极执行国家产业政策
    本报北京7月29日讯　记者鲁牧从国家计委了解到：辽宁省采取先易后难、分步实施办法，积极落实国家产业政策，效果不错。
    我国最大的重工业基地辽宁，产业结构向为“重型倾斜”，农业、轻工业相当薄弱。因此，每年要调入大量粮油肉蛋等农副产品和轻纺工业品。又由于高耗能产业占的比重大，加剧了能源供应紧张态势，全省相当一部分生产能力被迫闲置。此外，还存在着产业技术构成落后、地区分布不合理等诸多制约全省经济发展的因素。省里认为，所有这些都需要在实施国家产业政策、调整产业结构中逐步加以解决。
    进入第二季度以来，该省首先根据国家产业政策，校正原来提出的产业、产品发展研究意见，着手制订全省产业、产品结构《调整意见》。同时，遵循国家产业政策导向，提出了《近期资金投向问题的建议》，以指导今年的固定资产投资活动。《建议》明确要求，把投资重点放在国家产业政策支持发展的产业上。
    从调整产品结构方面看，国家产业政策的作用已开始在辽宁显现。首季度由于供电紧张，重工业增长幅度小，一些产品未完成国家计划，财政收入受到较大影响。进入二季度后，按照国家产业政策，在电力、资金分配上采取倾斜措施，结果原材料工业生产出现回升。鞍钢等大型企业扭转了连续3个月负增长局面。全省钢材品种结构有所调整，上半年板管带材比重比去年同期增长1.36％。市场紧俏短线产品、支农产品增长较快，增加了有效供给，促进了货币回笼。
    为全面实施国家产业政策，辽宁已制订出贯彻《国务院关于当前产业政策要点的决定》实施办法初稿。目前，省计经委正在积极协调各行业主管部门的意见，并与有关经济综合管理部门加紧协商，以便尽快制订出全省当前的产业结构、产品结构调整意见。
