    The Difficulty of Redeeming Treasury Bonds Warrants Attention
    Xinhua News Agency reporter Wang Cunli

    Since July 1, Ningxia has begun the process of redeeming part of the treasury bonds issued from 1982 to 1984. In just a few days, the public has expressed numerous complaints about the limited number of redemption points, short operating hours, long queues, and difficulties in redeeming the bonds.

    On the morning of July 6 at 8:10, the reporter arrived at the Construction Bank's Yinchuan Branch and received redemption voucher number 44. Already, more than 20 people had gathered, but the redemption process had not yet begun. A staff member said that redemption would start around 10:30. This redemption point operates for 6.5 hours a day, issuing 50 vouchers in the morning and 50 in the afternoon. Those who receive a voucher are guaranteed redemption. At 8:30, the reporter went to the Agricultural Bank's Gulou Savings Office, where more than 20 people were already queued up. Upon inquiry, it was found that many had not been able to redeem their bonds the previous day and had come early to try again. However, this redemption point does not start until 9:00.

    The reporter visited several other redemption points and found that some only opened the window facing the street, with queues stretching out onto the street; others had limited space, crowded with people, and were uncomfortably hot. Most redemption points operate for only about 7 hours a day, in stark contrast to the full-day operation of savings services. An elderly man who had waited two hours to redeem 120 yuan in treasury bonds angrily said, "When they issued the bonds, they deducted wages without any notice, and now redemption is so difficult. What is the reason for this?"

    According to the Autonomous Region's Treasury Bond Office, Ningxia needs to redeem approximately 20 million yuan in treasury bonds this year. Before the redemption, they formulated some preferential policies to encourage collective redemption by enterprises and institutions, but there were few takers. The enthusiasm of the banks for redemption was also low, with only a few savings offices handling the redemption business. A deputy manager of the Industrial and Commercial Bank's Yinchuan Branch explained the difficulties faced by the savings offices: first, they have to advance the funds, exacerbating the financial strain; second, the redemption volume is large and prone to errors, reducing the staff's enthusiasm; third, it affects savings business; fourth, the redemption handling fee is too low, lacking appeal.

    This issue has attracted the attention of relevant departments in Ningxia. Some banks have added new redemption points, but the problem of difficult redemption has not been solved. Many comrades pointed out that issuing treasury bonds is a serious and important task, and relevant departments must take measures to improve the redemption process as soon as possible.

### 国库券兑付难值得注意

    国库券兑付难值得注意
    新华社记者　王存理
    7月1日以来，宁夏开始进行1982年到1984年部分国库券兑付工作。短短几天，群众对兑付网点少、营业时间短导致兑换排长队、难兑付等问题意见纷纷。
    7月6日早晨8时10分，记者来到建设银行银川市支行，领到44号兑付证。这里已聚集20多人，但兑付工作还没有开始。一位工作人员说，10时半左右才可以兑付。这个兑付点每天营业6个半小时，上下午各发50个号。领到号的保证兑付。8时30分记者来到农业银行鼓楼储蓄所，这里也已排上20多人，一打听不少人是前一天没有兑付，今天又早早赶来排队的。而这个兑付点9点以后才开始兑付。
    记者又转了几个兑付点，但见有的兑付点只打开面街的窗户，兑换者的队伍排到大街上；有的兑付点空间狭小，人群熙攘，燥热难耐。大多数兑付点每天只兑付7个小时左右，这与储蓄业务全天营业形成鲜明对比。一位排了两个小时才将120多元国库券兑付的老大爷气愤地说：“发行时硬扣工资连个招呼也不打，兑付时又这么难，这是什么道理？”
    据自治区国库券办公室介绍，今年宁夏需兑付的国库券约2000万元。兑付前他们制定了一些优惠政策，鼓励企事业单位集体兑付，但应者寥寥。各银行兑付积极性也不高，只有部分储蓄所办理兑付业务。工商银行银川支行的一位副行长道出了储蓄所的苦衷：一是要垫付资金，加剧资金紧张；二是兑付业务量大，且容易出差错，职工没有积极性；三是影响储蓄业务；四是兑付手续费太低，没有吸引力。
    这一问题已引起宁夏有关部门的注意。有的银行新增加了兑付点，但兑付难的问题并没有解决。许多同志指出，发行国库券是一项严肃而重要的工作，有关部门一定要采取措施，尽快改进兑付工作。
