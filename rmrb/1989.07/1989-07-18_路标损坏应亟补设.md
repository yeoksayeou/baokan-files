    Damaged Road Signs Should Be Promptly Replaced

    I took a bus from Mengzi County to Laochang. After the bus entered the Datun Mine area, the roads were steep and winding, making it a nerve-wracking journey. However, there were hardly any intact traffic signs along the way.

    During the trip, I witnessed two traffic accidents. At a sharp bend in Yangba Diba, the driver did not honk, and the bus collided with an oncoming truck, nearly plunging into a deep ravine. At Malu Tang, I saw a truck overturn down the mountain slope while turning on a downhill curve.

    The road from Datun Mine area to Laochang is about 50 kilometers long, with complex terrain and a high risk of accidents. Promptly replacing traffic signs and reminding drivers can greatly enhance road safety. This is especially crucial in mountainous areas.

    路标损坏应亟补设
    我从蒙自县乘车去老厂。车进入大屯矿区后，山高坡陡，路窄弯急，令人提心吊胆。但途中交通路标完好的所剩无几。
    一路上，我目睹两起行车事故。在羊坝坻一急弯处，司机未鸣号，与对面驶来的卡车相撞，险些掉下深沟。在马鹿塘我看到一辆卡车在下坡转弯处翻下山坡。
    从大屯矿区到老厂约50公里，山路地势复杂，容易发生事故。及时补设交通路标，及时提醒司机，对行车安全大有好处。在山区，尤为必要。
