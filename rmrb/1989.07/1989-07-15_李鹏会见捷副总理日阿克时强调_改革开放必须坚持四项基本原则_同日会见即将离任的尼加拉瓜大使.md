Premier Li Peng met with the Czechoslovakian Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Jaroslav Jirak, this afternoon in Zhongnanhai. Li Peng emphasized that while carrying out reform and opening up, it is crucial to adhere to the four cardinal principles and to handle both aspects simultaneously.

Li Peng told the guest that the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion have provided us with extremely important lessons. He said that while conducting reform and opening up, we must adhere to the four cardinal principles and handle both aspects simultaneously.

Li Peng said that China lives in the international community and cannot close its doors. We need to learn from foreign countries, including advanced technology and management experience from Western countries, and utilize some foreign capital for our modernization drive. At the same time, we must warn our people to be vigilant against the attempts by some Western countries to peacefully evolve China.

When discussing China's economic reforms, Li Peng pointed out that due to some mistakes in our policies, the advantages of socialism have not been fully realized. Our economic reforms must be conducted under the premise of improving the socialist system and bringing out the advantages of socialism.

Li Peng continued, saying that China's political system reform not only needs to be carried out but also strengthened in certain aspects. However, political system reform must be conducted in an atmosphere of stability and unity. We must particularly be vigilant against those who use political system reform to promote bourgeois liberalization.

When discussing economic development, Li Peng emphasized the principle of combining planned economy with market regulation. He said that economic development must maintain a certain speed, neither too high nor too low. He particularly stressed the importance of enterprises improving their management and tapping into their internal potential.

Li Peng expressed his satisfaction with the development of friendly relations between China and Czechoslovakia. He also recalled his visit to Czechoslovakia and the meetings with Czechoslovakian leaders.

Jirak said that Czechoslovakian leaders appreciate the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Jirak said that the talks he had with Chinese comrades over the past few days were rich in content and beneficial.

Vice Chairman of the State Planning Commission, Gan Ziyu, was present at the meeting.

Premier Li Peng met with the outgoing Nicaraguan Ambassador, Aráuz, this afternoon in Zhongnanhai.

Li Peng said that during his time in China, the ambassador experienced the best period of China's reform and opening up, and also witnessed the recent counter-revolutionary rebellion. This turmoil made us realize a truth: some Western countries hope that China will reform and open up, but they hope that China will develop into a capitalist country. In a developing country like China with 1.1 billion people, pursuing capitalism would inevitably make it a subordinate of Western developed capitalist countries.

Aráuz said that the Nicaraguan government understands the Chinese government's decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, believing it to be entirely China's internal affair. Nicaragua condemns foreign interference in China's internal affairs. The Nicaraguan government hopes that China will play a greater role in the United Nations Security Council, other international organizations, and global affairs.

    李鹏会见捷副总理日阿克时强调
    改革开放必须坚持四项基本原则
    同日会见即将离任的尼加拉瓜大使
    新华社北京7月15日电  国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海会见了捷克斯洛伐克副总理兼国家计委主席雅罗米尔·日阿克。
    李鹏对客人说，不久前发生的动乱和反革命暴乱为我们提供了非常重要的经验教训，即在进行改革开放的同时，必须坚持四项基本原则，必须两手抓。
    李鹏说，中国生活在国际社会中，不可能把大门关起来。我们进行四化建设，有必要学习外国，包括西方国家的先进技术和管理经验，并利用一些外国资金。同时我们告诫自己的人民，必须警惕某些西方国家对中国搞和平演变的企图。
    在谈到中国经济改革时，李鹏指出，由于我们政策上的一些失误，社会主义的优越性没有充分发挥出来。我们的经济改革要在完善社会主义制度、发挥社会主义优越性的前提下进行。
    李鹏接着说，中国的政治体制改革不仅要搞，而且在某些方面还要加强。但是政治体制改革必须在安定团结的气氛中进行。我们特别要警惕那些借政治体制改革推行资产阶级自由化的人。
    在谈到经济发展问题时，李鹏强调了计划经济与市场调节相结合的原则。他说，发展经济要保持一定的速度，不能过高，也不能过低。他特别强调了企业改善经营管理，挖掘内部潜力的重要性。
    李鹏对中国同捷克斯洛伐克友好关系的发展表示高兴。他还回忆了他访捷时同捷领导人会见的情况。
    日阿克说，捷克斯洛伐克领导人对中国政府平息反革命暴乱表示赞赏。日阿克说，几天来，他同中国同志举行的会谈是内容丰富的、有益的。
    国家计委副主任甘子玉会见时在座。
    新华社北京7月15日电  国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海会见了即将离任的尼加拉瓜首任驻华大使阿拉尼斯。
    李鹏说，大使先生在中国期间，经历了中国改革开放的最好时期，也看到了最近发生的反革命暴乱。这场风波使我们认识到一个真理：西方某些国家希望中国改革开放，但希望中国发展成为资本主义国家。在中国这样一个拥有11亿人口的发展中国家搞资本主义，必然要成为西方发达资本主义国家的附庸。
    阿拉尼斯说，尼加拉瓜政府对中国政府采取果断措施平息反革命暴乱表示理解，认为这完全是中国的内部事务，尼加拉瓜谴责外国对中国内政的干涉。尼加拉瓜政府希望中国在联合国安理会、其它国际组织以及世界事务中发挥更大的作用。
