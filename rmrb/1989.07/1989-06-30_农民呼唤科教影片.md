Recently, while conducting interviews in rural areas, the author discovered that farmers throughout the countryside are eager to see educational and scientific films. Currently, martial arts and romantic films dominate the rural film market, while films related to rice, cotton, tobacco, and livestock breeding have been neglected by film distribution and screening units. When asked for the reasons, it was found that first, fewer educational and scientific films are being produced, and second, distribution and screening units believe that showing educational films is not profitable. Therefore, the author suggests that film distribution departments at all levels should quickly organize some educational and scientific films to be shown in rural areas, providing technical propaganda services to boost agricultural production.

Farmers, we need educational and scientific films!

    农民呼唤科教影片
    最近，笔者下乡采访时发现广大农村都渴望看到科教影片。现在武打、爱情影片占领了整个农村市场，而有关水稻、棉花、烟叶、养殖等科教影片被电影发行放映单位遗忘了。问其原因，一是科教影片摄制少了，二是发行放映单位觉得放科教片不赚钱。因此，笔者建议各级电影发行部门，应尽快组织一些科教影片下乡，为农业生产“升温”做好技术宣传服务。
    科教影片，农民呼唤你！
