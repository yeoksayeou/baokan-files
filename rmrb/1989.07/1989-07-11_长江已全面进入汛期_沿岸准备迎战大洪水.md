The flood season for major rivers in China is gradually approaching. How is the situation for the "father of rivers," the 10,000-li Yangtze River? According to reports from our correspondents along the river, the Yangtze River has fully entered the flood season, and areas along the river are preparing to battle major floods.

The Jingjiang River channel, due to the influence of recent heavy to torrential rains in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, has seen a continuous rise in water levels. By 8 a.m. today, the water level in Shashi reached 40.42 meters, and in Juanli, it reached 33.41 meters, exceeding the defense water level by 0.91 meters. The water level is still rising. The water situation in the Jiangxi section of the Yangtze River is currently stable, but the water level in Poyang Lake is still above the warning level. Since the night of July 7, the water level in the entire section from Anqing to Ma'anshan on the main stream of the Yangtze River has exceeded the warning level. There are 6 dangerous spots along the Yangtze River dikes, and flood control personnel have taken measures to eliminate dangers and reinforce the dikes. The water level in Anqing City reached 16.29 meters when the flood peak passed, exceeding the warning level by 0.21 meters. The water level in Anqing City began to recede at 6 a.m. on the 10th. The water level in the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province has also been rising in recent days, with heavy rainstorms in some areas. At 3 p.m. on the 9th, the high tide water level in Nanjing's Xuanwu District reached 9.02 meters, exceeding the warning line by 0.52 meters. Some riverbanks have collapsed.

Currently, various places are actively organizing forces to strengthen the dikes and are ready to respond to flood control and emergency rescue at any time.

Wang Shouqiang, director of the office of the State Flood Control Headquarters, told reporters today that the current flood situation in the Yangtze River is moderate to severe compared to the same period in previous years. Due to the continuous heavy rainstorms in the upper reaches, the water level in the middle and lower reaches is relatively high. Therefore, all areas along the river must remain vigilant and be prepared to battle major floods.

    长江已全面进入汛期  沿岸准备迎战大洪水
    据新华社北京7月11日电  我国各大江河汛期渐次来临，“江河之首”的万里长江汛情如何？本社综合沿江各省驻地记者今天发来的报道称：长江已全面进入汛期，沿江各地正做好迎战大洪水准备。
    荆江河道，由于受近期长江上游普降大到暴雨的影响，水位持续上涨。到今日上午8时，沙市水位达40.42米，监利水位33.41米，超过设防水位0.91米，目前水位仍在上涨。长江江西江段目前水情平稳，但鄱阳湖水位仍超出警戒水位。7月7日夜以来，长江干流安庆至马鞍山段全线超过警戒水位，长江堤防出现6处险情，防汛人员已采取除险加固措施，洪峰经过安庆市时水位达16.29米，超过警戒水位0.21米。10日上午6时起，安庆市水位回落。江苏境内长江水位近日也不断高涨，局部地区连降大暴雨。9日下午3时，南京下关长江高潮水位已达9.02米，超出警戒线0.52米。局部江滩发生坍塌现象。
    目前各地正积极组织力量，加强堤防，随时准备抗洪抢险。
    国家防汛总指挥部办公室主任王守强今天对记者说，目前长江汛情较往年同期属中等偏重。由于上游目前连降大暴雨，中下游底水较高，因此，沿江各地务必提高警惕，做好迎战大洪水准备。
