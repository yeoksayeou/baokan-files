In the July sun of Moscow, the sky is ablaze. Yet, every day, more than 10,000 people line up under the scorching sun outside Hall 2 of the Exhibition of Achievements of the National Economy of the USSR to visit the Chinese Science and Technology Exhibition.

Inside the exhibition hall, crowds gather in front of the television screens, captivated by the ever-changing, colorful images. The special effects displayed on the screens are mesmerizing. The color film processing equipment from the Shanghai "August 1" Film Machinery Factory can process 2,000 color photographs per hour, yet its price is only 1/3 to 1/2 of similar Western products. For Muscovites who have to forgo five liters of milk to afford a single color photo, this is an irresistible attraction. Women marvel at the elegant porcelain sets, exquisite packaged foods, delicate handicrafts, and vibrant fashion displays from the Ministry of Light Industry. Elderly visitors form long lines in front of the non-invasive cardiovascular blood flow parameter detection device developed by Beijing University of Technology, patiently waiting for their turn to be tested. This magical machine can provide 14 blood flow parameters in just two minutes. Some people have waited in line for two days to finally get their test. Children play with electronic games, watch electronic monkeys somersault, taste dried fruits from Guangxi, and linger, reluctant to leave. Young men crowd around the electronic and mechanical industry department's booth, which features dozens of audio devices, asking for brochures, inquiring about prices and functions. Visitors express their regret, "It's a shame this isn't a sales exhibition; we can only look, not buy!"

Opening the guestbook on the exhibition stand, one sees messages like "Long live China!" "Chinese people are great!" "Amazing exhibits, heroic people!" Several young workers wrote, "We are proud of your achievements, comrades, keep up the good work!" A middle school student studying Chinese, Alyosha, wrote in neat Chinese, "We love China." Spektorovich, who had contact with China in the 1950s, exclaimed, "In the past, I knew that Chinese lanterns and thermos bottles were beautiful. After 20 years apart, I see such outstanding electronic products!"

After visiting the exhibition, Chairman of the USSR State Committee for Science and Technology, Lavrov, told reporters, "Your traditional industries continue to excel, and your emerging industries are rapidly catching up. The close integration of high technology with people's lives is a hallmark of this exhibition."

Not far from the exhibition hall, by the pond, eight Chinese chefs are performing at the Friendship Restaurant, offering more than 20 kinds of snacks daily. The restaurant's daily revenue has doubled in just a few days.

The 27 ministries and 11 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions of China participating in the exhibition are often so busy that they don't have time for lunch. They excitedly say: "Visits, negotiations, and sales are all very active." Soviet enterprises and departments have expressed their desire to exchange Chinese products for foreign currency or goods, to cooperate with China in producing popular consumer goods, or to establish joint ventures. Soviet newspapers reported on the Chinese exhibition under the title "We Have Discovered China." (Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 20)

    我们发现了中国
    盛世良  王南枝
    7月的莫斯科，烈日当空。苏联国民经济成就展览馆2号厅前，却每天都有1万多人在骄阳下排长队，等候参观中国科技展览。
    在展厅里的电视墙前站满了苏联观众，电视屏幕上忽大忽小、忽动忽静的变幻多彩的画面吸引着他们。那些表现中国特技功能的图像更是令人眼花缭乱。上海“八一”电影机械厂的冲印设备每小时能冲印出2000张彩色照片，价格却仅为西方同类产品的1／3至1／2，这对印一张彩照要少喝5升牛奶的莫斯科人来说，具有像磁石般的吸引力。观众中的妇女们在轻工业部展出的高雅的成套瓷器、精美的小包装食品、玲珑剔透的工艺品、绚丽多彩的时装展品前赞叹不已。
    中老年人在北京工大研制的心血管血流参数无损伤探测仪前排成几十人的长队，耐心地等候给自己作一次探测。这架神奇的机器在两分钟内就可提供14个血流参数，有人来这里排了2天队，才如愿以偿。儿童们玩电子游戏机、看电子猴翻跟头，品尝广西的果脯，流连忘返，不愿离去。小伙子们围着机械电子工业部展台上的几十种音响设备，索取说明书，询问价格和功能。观众纷纷表示遗憾，“可惜这不是展销会，只能看，不能购买！”
    打开展台的留言册，只见上面写着“中国万岁！”“中国人是好样的！”“绝妙的展品，英雄的人民！”几名青年工人写道：“为你们的成就而自豪，伙伴们，继续努力！”一位学中文的中学生阿廖沙用工整的中文写道：“我们爱中国。”50年代就同中国有交往的斯佩克托连科感慨地写道：“过去知道中国的宫灯和热水瓶漂亮。相别20年，竟然看到这么出色的电子产品！”
    苏联国家科委主席拉维奥罗夫参观展览后对记者说，“你们的传统产业继续发挥优势，新兴产业也迅速赶上，高技术同人民生活密切结合，是这个展览会的特点。”
    离展厅不远的池塘旁，8位中国厨师在这儿的友谊餐厅献艺，每天提供20多种小吃，餐厅的日营业额几天内翻了两番。
    参展的中国27个部、11个省市自治区的工作人员经常忙得顾不上吃午饭，他们兴奋地说：参观、谈判、买卖3活跃。苏联企业或部门纷纷表示想用外汇或商品交换中国产品，想同中国合作生产畅销消费品或创办合资企业。苏联报纸以《我们发现了中国》为题，报道了这次中国展览。　（新华社莫斯科7月20日电）
