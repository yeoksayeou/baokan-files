The American media has always prided itself on enjoying high levels of press freedom and has consistently boasted about its accuracy in reporting news. However, judging from their coverage of the events leading up to and following the Beijing turmoil, I believe their performance was the worst. As I am currently writing a book titled "A History of the American News Industry," I feel that this incident will become a stain on the history of American journalism.

A large number of American journalists went to Beijing this time, originally to report on the dynamics of Gorbachev's visit to China. However, they encountered student demonstrations and protests, so they stayed there to report on the situation. Following the escalation of the student movement into turmoil, according to their words, they "encountered a rare opportunity" and, of course, did not want to miss this "once-in-a-lifetime chance," so they stayed. They transmitted the chaotic situation on Tiananmen Square to the United States, and apart from the on-site photographic footage, the rest of the reports were almost entirely rumors heard from others, which were then embellished and presented as "analysis" based on intuition and subjective views. Some reporters even made "predictions" like fortune-tellers, thus becoming a dish like the famous "stir-fried pork slices with three extras and tofu" from a small restaurant outside Beijing University in the old days.

It is true that American press freedom includes the "feature" of reporting rumors, and this "feature" is a magical formula for increasing newspaper sales. However, when reporting, one must still indicate the "source of the information." For example, the recently inaugurated Speaker of the U.S. Senate, Thomas Foley, was called a "liberal in the closet" by Mark Goodin, the public relations director of the Republican National Committee. This is not so bad, but the worst part is that he also spread the rumor that "Foley is a homosexual," resulting in losing his job in the face of public outrage. It can be seen that American-style press freedom does not include the freedom to spread rumors.

Strangely, the American media showed a particular interest in rumors during their reporting of the Beijing turmoil. The biggest rumor was "Deng is dead, Yang has fled, Li is injured." Several major television networks, including CNN, CBS, and NBC, had their correspondents in Beijing simultaneously transmit the rumors they heard from Tiananmen Square to the United States. Newspapers then published these rumors on the front page as if they had found a treasure, with some even using large headlines to sensationalize them. The most absurd thing was that some malicious individuals in the Chinese community immediately took coordinated action, using rumors to create local rumors. For example, I received phone calls from friends who had heard local rumors asking, "Is it true that the Chinese Consulate General in San Francisco lowered its flag to half-mast?" I immediately called the acting Consul General, Gao Daozhou, and his response was "Absolutely not!"

Rumors are like snowballs; the more they roll, the bigger they get. However, once they reach the bottom of the mountain, they will shatter into pieces upon impact. Now the truth is clear: the rumor about "Deng is dead, Yang has fled" was spread most vigorously by Hong Kong newspapers with the headline "According to reliable sources from Beijing." The so-called "reliable information" was also heard on Tiananmen Square. This "reliable information" was then transmitted back to Tiananmen Square from Hong Kong, and American journalists transmitted it overseas. The rumor about "Li Peng being assassinated and injured in the leg" was spread by a Chinese student surnamed Huang who returned to Beijing from New York. He stayed in Beijing for only a week before hurriedly flying back to the United States and openly appearing on CNN, not only admitting to spreading the rumor but also smiling and laughing, thinking it was his life's masterpiece. When the radio program host asked him why he created the rumor, he shamelessly replied, "That was imitating the propaganda techniques of the Communist Party of China!" Such a disgraceful performance appearing on national television screens, I believe, would make any Chinese person with a sense of decency feel heartbroken. My personal feeling is that if this rascal had stood in front of me and said these words, I would definitely have slapped him to vent my anger. Because this person's mentality is already miles away from political beliefs, but his character is rotten to the core, exposing the shameless ugliness of "a Chinese person learning the language of a barbarian, still cursing the Chinese people on the city walls."

This time, the American media's spreading of rumors also presented a "unique" feature that is "unprecedented," that is, "transoceanic resonance." Some people quickly transmitted the rumors from Tiananmen Square back to Beijing and Shanghai, of course, with the addition of American and Hong Kong protest footage to boost the momentum. Thus, some American media outlets were pleased with themselves, thinking they had achieved "unexpected results," or in other words, they had achieved the effect of "fanning the flames." This mentality of fearing that the world is not chaotic enough is far from the performance that journalists, who usually boast about the importance of factual reporting and emphasize the word "factual" three times, should have!

In addition to the aforementioned rumors of "Deng is dead, Yang has fled, Li is injured," there was another "shocking" rumor, that is, "the People's Liberation Army of China is split into two factions, one of which does not obey the central command, and civil war is imminent..." Under the reporting of American journalists, China was already in a state of panic, with every rustle of leaves and every movement of grass seeming like an impending disaster. Even when Tiananmen Square returned to its original state and troops were redeployed, they continued to spread rumors, saying things like "This is to protect the capital's construction and cultural relics, so they moved their positions, transferring the battlefield of the civil war to outside the city of Beijing..." and so on.

Now that the truth is clear, the American media, which spread rumors and acted as "prophets," have been embarrassed, so they have adopted another attitude. The front-page headline of the June 13 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle that I have in front of me reads "China Searches for Students," and on the inside page, there is a column article by international editor Russell titled "The Accounts of Eyewitnesses in China Are Being Questioned." The main content of the article is as follows: On June 5, Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po published an account by a 20-year-old Tsinghua University student who claimed to have "witnessed and survived" the events at the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square. He said that on the night of June 3 to the morning of June 4, he saw the "actual situation" there. His words were: "I saw with my own eyes the military opening fire on students sitting in the square." Because the American media considers Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po to be a reputable newspaper, the Washington Post, the New York Times, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the Chinese-language World Journal all published the aforementioned rumors based on the report. However, it is now found that there are doubts about the aforementioned rumors, the reasons being:

1. The student reported in the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po said that there were machine guns installed on the roof of the Museum of Chinese History, but the New York Times reporter Kristof said he saw no such evidence.
2. The student reported in the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po said that the military charged towards the students surrounding the Monument to the People's Heroes and beat them up, but Kristof denied this.
3. The "witness and survivor" student said that students were surrounded by military vehicles in the square and could not escape, but other media reports said that students had no problem leaving the square. Kristof's interviewees all said that at the time, military vehicles did not surround the Monument to the People's Heroes. As for the number of people in the square when the military finally entered, it is also a matter of debate.

Regardless of Russell's motive for writing that article, it is worth reading because it is like "a red spot in a sea of green," beginning to say a few fair words. The truth will continue to be revealed, and perhaps there will still be journalists with a sense of conscience who will speak the truth. However, those who spread rumors are not to be forgiven. As for Hong Kong's Wen Wei Po, which is usually considered patriotic, its performance this time is truly heartbreaking.

    美新闻媒介如此报道北京暴乱
    〔美国〕翁绍裘
    美国新闻媒介一向以享有高度新闻自由而自炫，并且在报道新闻方面一直标榜其正确水平，可是就此次对北京动乱前前后后的报道来看，我认为表现得最为差劲。由于我正在撰写《美国新闻事业史话》一书，我的感觉是这一次美国新闻媒介的表现，将成为美国新闻史上一个污点。
    这一次大批美国新闻工作者到北京去，本来是为了报道戈尔巴乔夫访华动态，但却碰上了学生游行示威事件，于是他们便呆在那里反映情况。接着又因学潮造成动乱，按照他们的说法是“欣逢其盛”，当然不愿错过“千载良机”，留着不走。他们把天安门广场上的纷乱情况向美国传播，除了现场的摄影镜头外，其余的报道则几乎完全是耳朵里所听到的谣言，再予以加油添醋，用直觉和主观的看法当做“分析情况”，有的记者还像预言家一般发出“预言”，于是便成为早年北京大学校园外小菜馆那道名菜“回锅肉片瘦加三样免辣子加豆腐干大大少”。
    一点不错，美国新闻自由是包括可以报道谣言这一“特色”的，这一“特色”也是增加报纸销路的无上法宝，但在报道时仍须说明
  “消息来源”。比如最近刚刚上台的美国国会参议院议长覃姆氏·佛尔里（THOMAS　FOLEY），便被共和党全国委员会的公关主任马克·古律丁（MARK　GOODIN）称为“衣柜里的开明派”，这还算不了什么，最糟的是他还散播“佛尔里是一个同性恋者”的谣者，结果在“众怒难犯”的情况下丢了差使。可见美国式的新闻自由，并没有包涵散播谣言的自由。
    奇怪得很，美国新闻媒介这次在报道北京动乱情况时，对谣言却特别有兴趣，其中最大的谣言是“邓死、杨走、李伤”，几家大电视台，包括CNN、CBS和NBC的驻北京记者均不约而同地把从天安门广场上听到的谣言传播到美国来，于是报纸便如拾至宝般在首页发表，有的还用大字标题予以渲染。最荒谬的是华人社会一些存心不良之辈随即配合行动，利用谣言制造本地的谣言，举例说，我便接到一些听到本地谣言的朋友打电话问道：“听说中国驻旧金山总领事馆下半旗，有没有这件事？”我随即打电话询问代总领事高道周，他的答复是“绝无其事！”
    谣言这东西是像滚雪球一般，越滚越大，可是滚到了山下，仍是要一碰便粉身碎骨的。现在已经真相大白，关于“邓死、杨走”的谣言，是香港报纸以“本报据北京可靠消息”散播得最为起劲的，所谓“可靠消息”，也是在天安门广场上用耳朵听来的。“可靠消息”然后又从香港传回天安门广场，美国记者便越洋传至海外。关于“李鹏被行刺，腿部中了子弹受伤”的谣言，则是一个姓黄的中国留学生从纽约回到北京时散播出来的。他在北京只待了一个星期，便匆匆飞回美国，公开在CNN电视上露相，不仅承认了散播谣言，而且笑逐颜开、喜形于色，自以为是生平得意杰作。当电台节目主持人询问他为什么要制造谣言时，他竟然这样恬不知耻地答道：“那是仿效中共的宣传技术的！”像这样以造谣为荣的丑态出现在全国电视屏幕上，稍有良知的中国人，相信都会由于他丑化中国人的形象而感到痛心疾首的。我个人的感觉是当时如果这浑小子站在我面前说这些话时，我一定会刮他一下巴掌以消心头的愤恨不可。因为这种人的心态，已和政治信仰相去千万里，而是品质糟得透顶，暴露了“汉人学得胡儿语，犹向城头骂汉人”的无耻丑态。
    这一次美国新闻媒介散播谣言还出现一个“史无前例”的“特色”，那便是“越洋的回响”，有人把从天安门广场上传来的谣言，很快地传回北京和上海去，当然也配上美国和香港的游行示威镜头助长声势，于是便有一些美国新闻媒介沾沾自喜，认为是“收获了意想不到的效果”，换句话说，是收获了“煽风浇油”的效果吧。这种唯恐天下不乱的心态，哪里是平素标榜报道新闻要着重确实原则，并且把“确实”这名词叫了三遍的新闻记者应有的表现！
    除了上述“邓死、杨走、李伤”的谣言以外，还有一项“触目惊心”的谣言，那便是“中国人民解放军分裂为两派，其中一派不服从中央的指挥，内战一触即发……”在美国记者的报道下，中国已是风声鹤唳、草木皆兵，天下大乱之势已是无可避免的了。一直到天安门广场恢复原来面目、部队进行调防时，他们仍在散播谣言，说什么“那是为了要保护首都建设和文物，于是转移阵地，把内战战场移到北京城外去……”云云。
    由于现在真相大白，散播谣言兼“预言家”的美国新闻媒介碰了一鼻子灰，于是灰溜溜地摆出另一种姿态了。摆在我面前的6月13日的《旧金山观察家报》首页大号标题是“中国搜索学生”，内页有一篇由国际编辑罗素写的专栏文章，题为《中国目睹者的传闻受到质疑》。文章内容大意是说香港《文汇报》于6月5日发表了自称为在天安门广场中国人民革命英雄纪念碑前“目睹和生还”的20岁清华大学学生的口述，他说他于6月3日夜间至4日早晨7时20分，在那里所看到的“实况”，他的话是这样的：“我亲眼看到军队开枪射击坐在广场上的学生。”由于美国新闻界认为香港《文汇报》是一家有声望的报纸，因此《华盛顿邮报》、《纽约时报》、《旧金山观察家报》和中文《世界日报》均根据该报报道而发表上述传闻，但是现在却发觉上述传闻有可疑之处，理由如下：
    一、香港《文汇报》报道那个学生说历史博物馆屋顶上装置机关枪，《纽约时报》记者克里斯多夫（KRISTOF）的报道则说看不到这样的证据。
    二、香港《文汇报》报道那个学生说军队冲向围绕在人民英雄纪念碑周围的学生，并将他们殴打，克里斯多夫则否认其事。
    三、那个“目睹者和生还”的学生说学生被军队车辆围困在广场内无法逃脱，但是其他新闻媒介的报道则说学生撤离广场根本没有问题，克里斯多夫所采访的人，都说当时军车并没有将人民英雄纪念碑包围起来。至于当军队最后开进广场时，广场上人数的多少，也是一个争论的问题。
    不管罗素写那篇文章的动机如何，总是值得一读的，因为那像“万绿丛中一点红”一般，开始有人说一两句公道话了，真相还会继续大白特白的，或许还会有本着良知的新闻工作者说公道话的，然而对于那些造谣的人却是不容宽恕的，至于一向被视为爱国的香港《文汇报》，这一次的表现却是令人感觉到痛心疾首的。
