	Commissioner of the State Council, Mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong

	Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and Members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress!

	From mid-April to early June 1989, a small number of individuals took advantage of the student movement to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil, which then escalated into a counterrevolutionary rebellion in the capital, Beijing. Their goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. The occurrence and development of this turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion had profound international backgrounds and domestic social foundations. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said: "This turmoil was bound to happen. It was determined by the international climate and China's own climate, and it was inevitable, regardless of people's will." In this struggle concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, Comrade Zhao Ziyang made serious errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party, bearing irrevocable responsibility for the formation and development of the turmoil. In the face of such a grave situation, the Party Central Committee made correct decisions and took a series of resolute measures, which were firmly supported by the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country. The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at their core, played an extremely important role in winning this struggle. The People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers made tremendous contributions to suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals resolutely opposed the turmoil and rebellion, closely united around the Party Central Committee, and demonstrated a high level of political awareness and a sense of responsibility. Now, I am reporting to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, on behalf of the State Council, on the situation of this turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion, especially the situation in Beijing, and the work of suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counterrevolutionary rebellion.

	I. The Brewing and Premeditation of the Turmoil

	Some political forces in the Western world have always attempted to make socialist countries, including China, abandon the socialist path and ultimately fall under the control of international monopolistic capital, integrating into the capitalist system. This has been their long-term fundamental strategy. In recent years, they have intensified this strategy by taking advantage of certain policy mistakes and temporary economic difficulties in socialist countries. In China, a small number of people within and outside the Party who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engage in political intrigue have colluded with these Western countries, forming an internal and external alliance, and working from top to bottom to create turmoil in China, overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, and subvert the socialist People's Republic. Because of this, throughout the process of brewing, planning, and initiating the turmoil, including the use of various means such as creating public opinion, distorting facts, and spreading rumors, there have been clear signs of domestic and foreign, internal and external coordination and collaboration.

	Let me elaborate on the situation since the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. In September last year, the Party Central Committee proposed the policy of rectifying the economic environment, regulating the economic order, and comprehensively deepening reforms. The broad masses and young students supported and endorsed this decision and the various measures taken. The overall social order and political situation were basically stable. This year, the National People's Congress passed the government work report delivered by Comrade Li Peng with an overwhelming majority of votes (only two votes against and four abstentions), which is a good proof. Of course, the people and young students also raised many criticisms regarding some mistakes made by the Party and government in their work, some corrupt practices among state officials, and social inequities in distribution, while also proposing many requirements and suggestions for promoting democracy, improving the legal system, deepening reforms, and overcoming bureaucratism. These are normal phenomena and are issues that the Party and government are currently addressing. However, at that time, there were indeed a small number of people within the Party and society who were closely colluding, openly and secretly engaging in a large number of extremely abnormal activities.

	Particularly noteworthy is that after Comrade Zhao Ziyang met with an "extreme liberal economist" from the United States on September 19 last year, some publications in Hong Kong that were allegedly closely associated with Zhao Ziyang's "think tank" conducted extensive propaganda, revealing political information such as "Beijing using Hong Kong media to overthrow Deng and protect Zhao." The editor-in-chief of the reactionary magazine "The 1990s," Li Yi (alias Qixin), published an article titled "The Patriarch Should Retire" in the Hong Kong "Information Daily," calling for the removal of "the obstacle of superannuated politics" and giving Zhao Ziyang "sufficient power." Another article in "The 1990s" called for Zhao to become a "dictator." The Hong Kong "Liberation" magazine also published a long article stating that some people in Beijing had "clear or obscure, flickering like ghost fire" relationships with certain individuals in the Hong Kong media industry, and that this subtle relationship had a "new case" that was "the recent wave of overthrowing Deng and protecting Zhao," and that "in terms of the hope of the Chinese rightists, they have identified Zhao Ziyang." In line with this "overthrowing Deng and protecting Zhao" trend, the Beijing "Economic Weekly" published a dialogue between Yan Jiaqi (a researcher at the Institute of Political Science, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences) and another person, who were closely associated with Zhao Ziyang's former secretary Bao Tong, attacking the "rectification and adjustment" as leading to "stagnation," and proposing that China's major problem was "not to repeat the non-procedural power succession of Khrushchev and Liu Shaoqi," and that "China no longer allows power changes like the Cultural Revolution through non-procedural means." The core issue of this dialogue was to cover up Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, maintain his position of power, and more brazenly promote bourgeois liberalization by creating public opinion. This dialogue was published in full or in part in multiple domestic and overseas publications such as the Shanghai "World Economic Herald" and the Hong Kong "Mirror."

	At the end of last year and the beginning of this year, the internal and external collusion intensified, and various political gatherings, joint petitions, big and small posters, and other activities with extremely erroneous and even reactionary views began to appear. For example, on December 7 last year, the "Future China and the World" symposium was held by the "Future China and the World" series, with Jin Guantao as the advisor. Jin Guantao said in his speech: "The attempt at socialism and its failure are one of the two major legacies of the 20th century for humanity." Gao Yang, the editor-in-chief of "New Outlook," immediately stood up as the "oldest" with several decades of party membership to "testify" that "Jin Guantao's denial of socialism is not too strong, but rather a bit polite." On January 28 this year, Su Shaozhi (a researcher at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Fang Lizhi, and others held a so-called "New Enlightenment Salon" at the "Dulac Bookstore" in Beijing. In addition to Chinese participants, there were also dozens of American, French, and Italian journalists stationed in Beijing, totaling over 100 people. Fang Lizhi said that this type of gathering took a "completely critical, thoroughly critical" attitude towards the authorities, with a "strong smell of gunpowder," and that "action was needed now," and that "after three meetings, they would go to the streets." In early February, Fang Lizhi, Chen Jun (a member of the reactionary organization "China Democratic League"), and others held a so-called "Celebrity and Scholar New Year Gala" at the Friendship Hotel. Fang Lizhi mainly spoke about the two major issues of "democracy" and "human rights," and Chen Jun compared the "May Fourth Movement" with the "Xidan Democracy Wall." Fang Lizhi said: "I hope that entrepreneurs, as China's new force, will combine with advanced intellectuals to fight for democracy." On February 16, Chen Jun held a press conference for foreign journalists, widely distributing Fang Lizhi's letter to Deng Xiaoping and the letter from Chen Jun and 33 others to the National People's Congress Standing Committee and the Central Committee of the Communist Party, demanding amnesty and the release of serious criminals such as Wei Jingsheng. On February 26, Zhang Xianyang (a researcher at the Institute of Marxism-Leninism, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Li Honglin (a researcher at the Fujian Academy of Social Sciences), Bao Zunxin (a deputy researcher at the Institute of History, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Gao Yang, and 42 others jointly wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party, also demanding the release of so-called "political prisoners." Subsequently, various universities in Beijing began to appear with a large number of big and small posters and gatherings attacking the Communist Party and the socialist system. For example, on March 1, Tsinghua University and Peking University simultaneously posted a big-character poster titled "Proclamation to Overthrow Deng and Letter to the People," claiming that "the politics of the Communist Party is empty talk, strong power, dictatorship, and arbitrariness," and openly demanding "the abolition of parties and the removal of the four cardinal principles." On March 2, Peking University posted a small-character poster titled "A Lament for the Chinese People," calling for the overthrow of "autocracy" and "dictatorship." On March 3, Tsinghua University and other schools posted a letter from the "Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Democratic Youth Patriotic Association" to "all young students," inciting them to "join the 'democracy, freedom, and human rights' torrent under the leadership of the democratic and patriotic fighter Fang Lizhi." On March 29, Peking University and other institutions widely posted Fang Lizhi's article "China's Disappointment and Hope" in the Hong Kong "Ming Pao," claiming that socialism had "completely lost its appeal," and calling for the formation of a political "pressure group" to implement "political democracy and economic freedom reform." What he called "reform" was actually a euphemism for complete Westernization. On April 6, Peking University posted a big-character poster titled "The Call of the Times," raising the questions of "whether socialism still has the rationality to exist" and "whether Marxism-Leninism is suitable for China's national conditions" in a completely negative manner. On April 13, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications and other schools received a letter from the "Student Union of Guangxi University" calling on "all university students to raise the portraits of Hu Yaobang and the banners of 'democracy, freedom, dignity, and rule of law' to commemorate the 'May Fourth' Youth Day." Meanwhile, in some universities in Beijing, so-called "democracy salons," "freedom forums," and various "research societies," "discussion forums," and "lecture halls" began to appear. The "democracy salon" hosted by Peking University student Wang Dan alone held 17 lectures in one year, with very frequent activities. They once invited the leader of the former illegal organization "Human Rights Alliance," Ren Wutong, to discuss "new authoritarianism and democratic politics," spreading many fallacies. They once held a discussion at the statue of Cervantes, openly declaring "to abolish the one-party system, make the Communist Party step down, and overthrow the current regime." They also invited Fang Lizhi's wife, Li Shuhuan, to act as their "military advisor." Li Shuhuan incited, saying: "To make the democracy salon legal," "to hold meetings here frequently," "to abolish Beijing's ten regulations on parades." All of these prepared the ground for the subsequent turmoil in terms of ideology and organization. The Hong Kong "Ming Pao" published an article commenting that: "The elite of Chinese intellectuals initiated a petition and signature movement to fight for human rights, which had a great impact on students. They had been brewing to take large-scale actions to express their dissatisfaction with the authorities on the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement. The sudden death of Hu Yaobang was like throwing a match into a barrel of gunpowder." In short, under the premeditation, organization, and planning of a small number of people, a "storm is coming, the wind is full" political situation had already formed.

	II. The Student Movement Was Exploited from the Beginning

	The death of Comrade Hu Yaobang on April 15 brought forward the long-brewing student movement and turmoil. The broad masses and young students mourned Comrade Hu Yaobang, expressing deep sorrow, and various universities provided conditions for students' mourning activities. However, a small number of people took this opportunity to use "mourning" as an excuse to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. The student movement was manipulated and exploited from the beginning, taking on the nature of political turmoil.

	This turmoil was first manifested in a large number of big and small posters, slogans, banners, leaflets, and couplets that attacked and slandered the Party and government, openly calling for the overthrow of the Communist Party's leadership and the subversion of the current regime. Some big and small posters in Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other institutions maliciously slandered the Communist Party as a "band of traitors," a "group that is about to collapse"; attacked the older generation of revolutionaries as "old fools in power," "dictatorial power concentration"; attacked the central leaders by name, claiming that "those who should not go have gone, and those who should die have not died"; demanded "to dismiss the incompetent government, overthrow the autocratic monarch"; demanded "to abolish the Communist Party, implement a multi-party system," "to abolish the party branches and political workers in all organizations, military, schools, and units"; issued a "Private Property Declaration," calling for "to ring the death knell of public ownership early and welcome the new tomorrow of the republic"; even proposed to "invite the Kuomintang back to the mainland to establish a two-party political system," and so on. Many big and small posters used unprintable language to slander Comrade Deng Xiaoping, shouting "Down with Deng Xiaoping."

	This turmoil, from the beginning, was a sharp confrontation between bourgeois liberalization and the four cardinal principles. The programmatic slogans proposed by the turmoil planners during this period, whether it was the "nine demands" first proposed by the illegal student leader Wang Dan at Tiananmen Square, or the later "seven demands," "ten demands," etc., the most important were two: one was to reassess the merits and demerits of Comrade Hu Yaobang; the other was to completely negate the opposition to bourgeois liberalization and to rehabilitate the so-called "citizens who suffered unjust treatment in the anti-liberalization campaign." The essence of these two points was to achieve absolute freedom in China to oppose the four cardinal principles and realize capitalism. In line with this demand, some so-called "elite" in the intellectual circle, that is, a small number of people who stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois liberalization stance, also organized various seminars during this period, using public opinion platforms to extensively propagate. The most prominent was the seminar held by the "World Economic Herald" and the "New Outlook" magazine on April 19 in Beijing. This seminar was chaired by Gao Yang, with participants including Yan Jiaqi, Su Shaozhi, Chen Ziming (Director of the Beijing Institute of Social and Economic Sciences), Liu Ruishao (Chief of the Beijing Office of the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po), and others. The center of their discussion was also two points: one was to rehabilitate Hu Yaobang, and the other was to overturn the anti-liberalization campaign, and they explicitly expressed their support for the students' parades and demonstrations, saying that they "saw the future and hope of China." Later, when the Shanghai Municipal Committee made the correct decision to rectify the "World Economic Herald," Comrade Zhao Ziyang, who had always indulged in bourgeois liberalization, not only did not support it but criticized the Shanghai Municipal Committee for "making things worse" and "being passive."

	This turmoil was also manifested in the fact that under the instigation and planning of a small number of people, many actions were extremely violent, violating the Constitution, laws, and regulations of the People's Republic of China, and were seriously anti-democratic and anti-legal. They ignored the abolition of the "four big freedoms" by the Constitution, disregarded advice, and plastered big-character posters all over the campus; they ignored the ten regulations on parades by the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee, did not apply for approval, and held large parades day after day; they stormed the Zhongnanhai, the residence of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, in the late nights of April 18 and 19, and shouted the slogan "Down with the Communist Party," which had never happened even during the Cultural Revolution; they violated the management regulations of Tiananmen Square, repeatedly occupied the square, almost causing the funeral of Comrade Hu Yaobang to be unable to proceed normally on April 22; they ignored the relevant regulations of Beijing City, established illegal organizations such as the "United Student Union" (later renamed the "High School Student Self-Governance Federation") without registration, and seized power from the legally elected student unions and graduate student unions; they disregarded discipline and school rules, occupied offices, seized broadcasting stations, and did whatever they wanted, causing serious anarchy on campus.

	Creating a large number of rumors, misleading people, and inciting the masses was another important means used by a small number of turmoil organizers and planners. At the beginning of the student movement, they spread rumors that "Li Peng cursed Hu Yaobang at the Politburo meeting, and Hu died of anger," leading people to direct their anger at Comrade Li Peng. In fact, the Politburo meeting discussed education issues, and when Comrade Li Tieying, a member of the Politburo and State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission, was explaining the relevant documents, Comrade Hu Yaobang suddenly suffered a heart attack and was immediately given emergency treatment on the spot, and after relief, was sent to the hospital. There was no such thing as dying of anger. On the night of April 19, a female student from the Foreign Language Department of Beijing Normal University was injured by a trolleybus on her way back from a concert after participating in a concert, and died despite rescue efforts. Someone spread the rumor that "the military and police of the Communist Party ran over and killed the student," making some students who did not know the truth agitated. In the early morning of April 20, our public security officers forcibly removed the students who stormed and besieged Zhongnanhai and sent them to Peking University by bus. Someone then fabricated the so-called "April 20 massacre," claiming that "the police beat people at Zhongnanhai, not only students but also workers, women, and children," and that "more than a thousand scientific and technological workers fell in a pool of blood," making some people even more indignant. On April 22, after the funeral of Comrade Hu Yaobang ended and the central leaders such as Li Peng left the Great Hall of the People, some people staged a hoax to create a pretext for attacking Comrade Li Peng. They first spread the rumor that "Premier Li Peng promised to come out at 12:45 to meet the students on the square," and then had three students kneel and present a "petition" at the east gate of the Great Hall of the People, and then claimed that "Li Peng changed his mind at the last minute, refused to meet, and deceived the students," inciting the tens of thousands of students on the square to strong dissatisfaction, almost causing a serious incident of storming the Great Hall of the People. Due to the deception and incitement of these rumors, the opposition between young students and the government was greatly intensified. A small number of people took advantage of this sentiment to propose the slogan "peaceful petition, the government does not listen, broadcast to the country, unified strike," causing 60,000 college students in Beijing to go on strike, and many colleges and universities outside Beijing also followed suit, escalating the student movement and expanding the turmoil.

	This turmoil also had the characteristic of no longer being limited to institutions of higher learning and the Beijing area, but spreading to the entire society and all parts of the country. After the funeral of Comrade Hu Yaobang ended, some people went to middle schools, factories, shops, and villages to link up, give speeches on the streets, distribute leaflets, post slogans, raise funds, and do everything possible to expand the situation. Some middle schools appeared with slogans "against the Communist Party of China," some middle schools appeared with big-character posters "strike against exams and strike against classes," and some factories posted leaflets "uniting workers and peasants to overthrow the tyranny." The organizers and planners of the turmoil also proposed the slogan "south to north, east to west," attempting to launch a nationwide link-up. Colleges and universities in Nanjing, Wuhan, Xi'an, Changsha, Shanghai, Harbin, and other places found students coming from Beijing, and students from Tianjin, Hebei, Anhui, Zhejiang, and other places also came to Beijing to participate in parades. In Changsha, Xi'an, and other places, serious criminal activities of beating, smashing, looting, and burning occurred.

	This turmoil, from the beginning, had various political forces from overseas and abroad interfering. Members of the reactionary organization "China Democratic League" such as Hu Ping, Chen Jun, and Liu Xiaobo, who were raised by the Kuomintang, jointly issued an "Open Letter to Chinese University Students" from New York, calling on students participating in the movement to "consolidate the organizational ties established in this activity, strive to act as a strong group effectively," "take the complete negation of the 1987 anti-liberalization movement as a breakthrough," "strengthen ties with various news media," "strengthen ties with other sectors of society," and "seek their support and participation in the movement." Two leaders of the "China Democratic League," Wang Bingzhang and Tang Guangzhong, hurriedly flew from New York to Tokyo, attempting to sneak back to Beijing and directly interfere in this turmoil. Some overseas Chinese intellectuals advocating the implementation of the Western capitalist system in China specially invited Fang Lizhi to lead and sent back the "Declaration on Promoting Democracy in Mainland China" from Columbia University, inciting people to overthrow the Communist Party. A person named "Hongyan" from the United States sent back "Ten Suggestions for Amending the Constitution" via fax, proposing that all representatives of the National People's Congress at all levels and judges of all levels of courts should be "elected from non-partisan candidates," attempting to completely exclude the Communist Party from state power organs and judicial organs. A group of original members of "China Spring" residing in the United States hastily formed the "China Democratic Party" and sent a "Letter to All Fellow Countrymen" to some universities in Beijing, inciting students to "demand that conservative bureaucrats step down," "urge the Communist Party to end its autocratic rule." The reactionary political forces in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United States, and Western countries also intervened through various channels and means. Some Western news agencies showed unusual enthusiasm, especially "Voice of America," which broadcasted three programs for more than ten hours a day, continuously reporting to mainland China, spreading rumors, inciting trouble, and fanning the flames for this turmoil.

	The above facts show that what we are facing is not a general student movement, but a political turmoil with a clear political purpose, deviating from the track of democracy and the rule of law, using vile political means to incite a large number of ignorant masses and students, and deliberately stirring up a turmoil to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. If we do not analyze and understand the problem in this way, we will make a big mistake and be at a great disadvantage in the struggle.

	III. The "April 26" Editorial of the People's Daily Correctly Defined the Turmoil

	From April 15, when Comrade Hu Yaobang died, to April 22, when the funeral ended, Comrade Zhao Ziyang adopted a tolerant and indulgent attitude towards the increasingly obvious signs of turmoil during the mourning activities, which encouraged the formation and development of the turmoil. Facing the increasingly grave situation, many comrades in the Central Committee and the Beijing Municipal Committee felt that the nature of the situation had changed and repeatedly suggested to Comrade Zhao Ziyang that the Central Committee should have a clear policy and strategy to quickly stop the development of the situation, but he always avoided seriously analyzing and discussing the nature of the situation. After the funeral of Comrade Hu Yaobang ended, the comrades in the Central Committee suggested again that he should hold a meeting before his visit to North Korea on April 23, but he not only refused to accept it but went to play golf as if nothing had happened. Due to his adoption of such an attitude, the Party and the government lost the opportunity to stop the turmoil.

	On the afternoon of April 24, the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government reported to Comrade Wan Li. At the suggestion of Comrade Wan Li, that evening, Comrade Li Peng presided over a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Politburo to seriously analyze and study the development of the situation. The meeting unanimously believed that the various situations at that time indicated that under the manipulation and instigation of a small number of people, a planned and organized anti-Party, anti-socialist political struggle had been placed before us. The meeting decided to establish a group to stop the turmoil in the Central Committee and at the same time required the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government to mobilize the masses, win the majority, isolate the minority, and strive to quickly quell the turmoil and stabilize the situation. The next morning, Comrade Deng Xiaoping delivered an important speech, fully agreeing with and supporting the decision of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, and deeply analyzing the nature of the turmoil. He pointed out in a penetrating manner that this was not a general student movement, but a political turmoil to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech greatly enhanced the awareness of the broad cadres, strengthened everyone's confidence and courage to quell the turmoil and stabilize the situation. The editorial of the People's Daily on April 26 embodied the decision of the Standing Committee of the Politburo and the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, clarifying the nature of the turmoil. At the same time, it clearly distinguished the small number of turmoil organizers and planners from the vast majority of young students. The publication of the editorial made the vast majority of cadres feel that they had a clear understanding and direction of action, and could carry out work with clear banners.

	After the publication of the People's Daily editorial, under the direct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party and the Municipal Government successively held various intra-party and extra-party meetings, insisting on principles, unifying thinking; using various forms to clarify rumors, stabilize people's minds; supporting school leaders, party members, and student cadres to work boldly, persuading and guiding students participating in parades and demonstrations; actively carrying out various dialogue activities, striving to win the masses. The dialogue between State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu and students, the dialogue between responsible comrades of relevant departments of the Central Committee and students, and the dialogue between the main leaders of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party and the Municipal Government and students all achieved good results. At the same time, serious work was done in factories, rural areas, shops, middle schools, and neighborhoods to stabilize the situation and prevent the turmoil from spreading to society. Various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also, according to the spirit of the editorial, quickly did a good job in their respective regions to prevent the situation in Beijing from spreading to other places.

	Due to the clear stance of the April 26 editorial, the organizers and planners of the turmoil were forced to make a 180-degree strategic turn. Before the editorial was published, a large number of slogans and banners were against the Communist Party, socialism, and the four cardinal principles; after the editorial was published, on April 26, the illegal organization "Beijing High School Self-Governance Federation" issued the "New Student Federation Order No. 1," requiring a parade to Tiananmen Square on April 27 "under the banner of supporting the Communist Party," with slogans including "supporting the Communist Party," "supporting socialism," "upholding the Constitution," etc., and under the instruction of Fang Lizhi, changed the subversive slogans such as "overthrow the bureaucratic government," "overthrow the corrupt government," and "overthrow the dictatorial rule" to slogans such as "anti-bureaucracy, anti-corruption, anti-privilege" that the general public agreed with. The Jiji Press in Japan sent a report from Beijing titled "Young Officials Form a Group Supporting Democratization," referring to some figures in the so-called "Zhao Ziyang think tank" as "young officials of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the government," saying that they "frequently contacted the representatives of the new self-governance associations of various universities in Beijing participating in the parade, such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University, and Beijing Normal University, giving students advice," and in the parade on the 27th, students held banners such as "supporting socialism" and "supporting the leadership of the Communist Party," which was also in accordance with the instructions of this group. The student movement leaders originally planned to "parade for 100 days and strike indefinitely," but after the editorial was published, this momentum was gone. Compared to the parade on May 4, the number of students decreased from more than 30,000 to less than 20,000, and the number of onlookers also decreased significantly. After the "May Fourth" parade, through the work of party and government leaders of various universities, 80% of the students resumed classes. The situation in various places across the country also quickly stabilized after the publication of the "April 26" editorial of the People's Daily. Obviously, with some more work, this turmoil initiated by a small number of people using the student movement could be quelled. A large number of facts show that the "April 26" editorial of the People's Daily is correct, and it indeed played a role in stabilizing the capital and calming the country.

	IV. Zhao Ziyang's "May Fourth" Speech Was the Turning Point for the Escalation of the Turmoil

	When the turmoil was about to be quelled, Comrade Zhao Ziyang, as the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, adopted an attitude of flip-flopping and inconsistency. Originally, during his visit to North Korea, when the Standing Committee of the Politburo sought his opinion, he sent a telegram clearly stating that he "completely agreed with the decision made by Comrade Xiaoping on how to deal with the current turmoil." After returning to the country on April 30, he also expressed in the Standing Committee of the Politburo meeting that he agreed with Comrade Xiaoping's speech and the definition of the turmoil in the April 26 editorial, believing that the previous handling of the student movement was good. However, after a few days, he delivered a speech that was completely opposed to the decision of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, Comrade Xiaoping's speech, and the spirit of the editorial when he met with the representatives of the Asian Development Bank Annual Meeting on the afternoon of May 4. First, in the face of the already obvious turmoil, he said "China will not have a major turmoil"; second, in the face of a large number of facts that had already proven that the essence of the turmoil was to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system, he still insisted that "they absolutely do not want to oppose our fundamental system, but demand that we change the problems in our work"; third, in the face of various facts that had already shown that a small number of people were using the student movement to instigate the turmoil, he still only said that it was "inevitable" that "someone tried to take advantage of it," completely denying the correct judgment of the Central Committee that a small number of people were already creating the turmoil. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech was drafted in advance by Bao Tong. Bao Tong also requested that the Central People's Broadcasting Station and television station broadcast it immediately that afternoon and broadcast it for three days; he also requested that the People's Daily publish it in a prominent position on the first page the next day and publish a large number of positive reflections from various aspects. For different opinions, not only were they withheld, but they were not even allowed to be published in internal reference materials. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech, after being extensively hyped by the People's Daily and some newspapers, caused serious confusion among the broad cadres and masses, giving the organizers and planners of the turmoil a boost, emboldening them, and encouraging them.

	Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech was completely different from the central policy, which not only caused widespread discussion domestically but was also clearly seen by foreign public opinion. Reuters reported that Zhao's speech "formed a sharp contrast with the harsh condemnation of students a week ago," and was a "major revision of the judgment last week." The French "Le Monde" also pointed out on May 6 that "this party leader (referring to Zhao Ziyang) seemed to have skillfully made the situation develop in his favor." After this speech was thrown out, cadres at all levels, party members, and backbone members of the masses, especially comrades in universities, felt confused and at a loss, and many people expressed opposition. Some said: "The Central Committee has issued two voices, who is right and who is wrong, and who should we follow?" Some said: "We are asked to be consistent with the Central Committee, but which Central Committee should we be consistent with?" Some said: "Ziyang is a good guy upstairs, and we are bad guys downstairs." School cadres and student backbones generally felt "betrayed," and their mood was very heavy, with some crying. The school work was completely passive. At that time, the situation of the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government was very difficult. Clearly knowing that the opinions of the Central Committee were not consistent, they still had to say to the lower levels that they were consistent, only that the "emphasis was different." Many things needed to be reported to the Central Committee, but Comrade Zhao Ziyang, as the General Secretary, delayed the convening of the meeting. Under the strong request of the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government, a meeting was reluctantly held on May 8, but it did not listen to the report of Beijing at all. At the meeting, some comrades reflected that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech on May 4 was inconsistent with the spirit of the April 26 editorial, and he said in a stern voice: "I made a mistake, I will take responsibility." At another meeting, some comrades reflected that the comrades on the front line all said "they were betrayed," and Comrade Zhao Ziyang angrily asked: "Who betrayed you? Only the Cultural Revolution had betrayed people." At that time, many people echoed the Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers, repeatedly attacking the comrades working on the front line such as the Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government, and even the hooligans in the parade shouted: "The Beijing Municipal Committee, false military information, deceiving the Central Committee, the crime is unforgivable." Everyone saw the situation deteriorating, and some measures could not be implemented.

	In contrast to the above situation, the organizers and planners of the turmoil were encouraged by Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech. Yan Jiaqi, Cao Siyuan (Director of the Development Research Institute of Four Communications), and others said: "Now there is a turning point, and we should mobilize the intellectual circle to support Zhao Ziyang." Zhang Xianyang said: "Isn't it said that we should use students? Zhao Ziyang is using them now." Under the incitement of Comrade Zhao Ziyang and the planning of a few people, the leaders of the "self-governance associations" of Peking University and Beijing Normal University immediately announced the resumption of the strike that night, and many schools also followed suit to announce the continuation of the strike, and organized "patrol teams" to prevent students who wanted to resume classes from entering the classrooms. Then, the tide of parades and demonstrations surged again. On May 9, more than 300 journalists from nearly 30 news agencies took to the streets, submitting a petition. More than ten thousand students from Peking University, Tsinghua University, Renmin University, Beijing Normal University, and other universities also took to the streets, demonstrating, supporting journalists, distributing leaflets, and inciting strikes and hunger strikes. From then on, the situation suddenly reversed, and the turmoil returned to its peak. Under the influence of Beijing, the situation that had already stabilized in other places became tense again. Not long after Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech, on May 9 and 10, a large number of students in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, stormed the provincial committee and the provincial government, stormed the ongoing International Economic and Technical Cooperation Negotiations, Import and Export Commodities Fair, and Folk Art Festival, causing very bad effects both domestically and internationally.

	V. Using Hunger Strikes as Blackmail, Further Exacerbating the Turmoil

	Good-hearted people asked, is it because the government does not understand, sympathize, or concede enough to the students that they are causing such a ruckus? The fact is not like that at all. From the beginning of the turmoil, the Party and the government fully affirmed the patriotic enthusiasm and concern for the country of the broad masses of young students, fully affirmed that the demands of the broad masses of young students to promote democracy, deepen reforms, punish corrupt officials, and eliminate corruption were consistent with the wishes of the Party and the government, and hoped to solve problems through democratic and legal normal procedures. However, this goodwill did not receive a positive response. The government proposed to hope to communicate through multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-form dialogues to communicate thoughts and increase understanding, but the illegal student organizations set a high price for the dialogue conditions. They demanded that the dialogue objects must be "members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, Vice Chairmen of the National People's Congress, and Vice Premiers or above," and that each dialogue "must issue a joint statement, signed by both parties," and that the dialogue must be held "by the government and student representatives alternately designating venues." This was not a dialogue at all, but a posture of political negotiation with the Party and the government. Especially after Comrade Zhao Ziyang's "May Fourth" speech, a small number of people took this opportunity to regard the Party and the government's restraint as weakness, demanding higher prices and harsher conditions, making the turmoil constantly escalate. Even in such a situation, the Party and the government still adopted a very tolerant and restrained attitude, hoping to continue to maintain the dialogue channel to educate the masses and win the majority. At 2:00 AM on May 13, the leaders of the "High School Self-Governance Federation" proposed the conditions for the dialogue, and at 4:00 AM, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the General Office of the State Council immediately replied in agreement, but after dawn, they went back on their word and canceled this dialogue. At 10:00 AM on May 13, the General Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the General Office of the State Council, and the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress again notified them that they decided to have a dialogue with the students on the 15th. They agreed on one hand, but on the other hand, they made a big fuss about the number of participants, first proposing a list of 20 people, and after the government agreed, they demanded to increase it to 200, and without fully discussing it, they accused the "government's dialogue lacked sincerity." Only 4 hours after receiving the notice of the dialogue, they hastily threw out the already prepared "Hunger Strike Declaration," launching a hunger strike that lasted for 7 days and involved more than 3,000 people, and from then on, they occupied Tiananmen Square for a long time. The leader of the "High School Self-Governance Federation," Wang Dan, said that the hunger strike began on the 13th, "just in time to pressure them with Gorbachev's visit to China." A small number of organizers and planners of the turmoil used the hunger-striking students as "hostages," gambling with their lives, using extremely vile means to blackmail the government, making the turmoil even more serious.

	During the students' hunger strike, the Party and the government continued to maintain an extremely restrained attitude, doing everything possible to work in various aspects. First, school staff, cadres at all levels, and even Party and state leaders went to Tiananmen Square many times to visit the hunger-striking students and guide them ideologically. Second, they assisted the Red Cross Society to dispatch more than 100 ambulances and hundreds of medical staff to guard the hunger strike site day and night, and mobilized 52 hospitals to vacate nearly 2,000 beds to ensure that students who fell into a coma or became ill due to hunger strikes were rescued and treated in time. Third, they provided various materials to reduce the pain of the hunger-striking students and ensure their safety as much as possible. The Beijing Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government dispatched cadres, workers, and vehicles through the Red Cross Society to transport water to the hunger-striking students day and night, providing salt and sugar; the Environmental Sanitation Bureau dispatched water trucks, prepared basins and towels for the hunger-striking students to wash; the Pharmaceutical Company dispatched sufficient anti-heatstroke, anti-cold, and anti-diarrhea drugs to be distributed by the Red Cross Society; the food department transported a large number of beverages and bread for emergency rescue of students; the commercial department dispatched 6,000 straw hats, and the Beijing Military Region sent 1,000 cotton quilts at the request of Beijing City to keep the hunger-striking students cool during the day and warm at night; to maintain the hygiene of the hunger strike site, temporary flushing toilets were set up, and sanitation workers also cleaned the hunger strike site in the middle of the night; before the heavy rain on the 18th, 78 large buses were dispatched from the Beijing Public Transportation Corporation, and more than 400 thick wooden boards were dispatched from the Materials Bureau to keep the hunger-striking students dry and prevent dampness. During the 7-day hunger strike, there was not a single incident of a student dying from hunger. However, all of these did not receive any positive response. The facts repeatedly educated people that a small number of organizers and planners of the turmoil were determined to oppose us to the end, and no matter how many times we were tolerant and how many steps we retreated, the problem could not be solved.

Title: The Turmoil and Counterrevolutionary Rebellion in the Capital Were Planned, Organized, and Carried Out by a Small Number of People
Author:
Date: 1989-07-06
Edition: 1

It should be particularly noted that in the face of rapidly deteriorating circumstances, Comrade Zhao Ziyang did not do what he should have done. Instead, he incited the media to lead public opinion astray, making an already bad situation even worse. On May 6, Comrade Zhao Ziyang told Hu Qili and Rui Xiaowen, who were then in charge of propaganda and ideological work at the Central Committee, that the reporting on the student movement should be "a bit more open," that the marches should be reported, and that the openness of the news should be increased a bit, saying that the risk was not great. He even said, "Facing the will of the people at home and the progressive tide of the world, we can only guide the situation." Here, he actually referred to the anti-communist and anti-socialist tide as the "will of the people at home" and the "progressive tide of the world." His instructions were transmitted that day to the major news organizations in the capital and were subsequently deployed multiple times. As a result, newspapers like the People's Daily and many other central publications adopted a fully affirmative and supportive attitude towards marches, sit-ins, and hunger strikes, reporting them extensively and even exaggeratingly. Even Hong Kong newspapers expressed surprise at this unusual phenomenon.

Under the misguided influence of public opinion, starting from May 15, the number of people taking to the streets to support the students increased daily, and the scale of the demonstrations grew larger, from tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, to hundreds of thousands. Students from more than 20 provinces across the country also came to show their support. For a time, it seemed that not participating in the marches was "unpatriotic," and not showing support was "not caring about the students' lives." In this situation, the students on hunger strike found themselves in a difficult position and could not stop. Many teachers and parents of students wrote letters and called the leadership and news organizations, asking the newspapers, radio stations, and TV stations not to drive the students on hunger strike to their deaths, asking them to show some mercy, save the children, and stop this "killing propaganda," but to no avail. Due to the students' hunger strike and the citizens' marches, the social order in the capital, Beijing, was in chaos. The much-anticipated high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union was seriously disrupted, and some activities were changed or canceled. Meanwhile, the number of demonstrators in major cities across the country, including all provincial capitals, increased dramatically. Some medium and small cities also saw demonstrations. The scale and severity of the disturbances were unprecedented since the founding of the nation.

To boost the morale of the students and add fuel to the fire of the turmoil, some stubborn advocates of bourgeois liberalization, so-called "elites," took to the stage. On the evening of May 13, Yan Jiaqi, Su Xiaokang, Bao Zunxin, and others posted a big-character poster titled "We Can No Longer Be Silent" at Peking University, mobilizing intellectuals to participate in the march they initiated to support the students' hunger strike. On May 14, Yan Jiaqi, Bao Zunxin, Li Honglin, Dai Qing (a reporter for the Guangming Daily), Yu Haocheng (former director of the Masses Publishing House), Li Zehou (a researcher at the Institute of Philosophy, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), Su Xiaokang (a lecturer at the Beijing Broadcasting Institute), Wen Yuanke (a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China), Liu Zaifu (director of the Institute of Literature, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences), and others issued an "Urgent Appeal on the Current Situation," demanding that the turmoil be declared a "patriotic democratic movement" and that the illegal student organizations be declared legal. They said that if their demands were not met, they would also go on hunger strike. This appeal was published in the Guangming Daily and broadcast on Central Television. These people also frequently went to Tiananmen Square to give speeches and incite the crowd, slandering our government as an "incompetent government," saying that the students' hunger strike showed "the bright future of China." They then formed the illegal "Capital Intellectuals Joint Conference," issuing the "May 16 Declaration," threatening that if the government did not accept the political demands of a few people, "it would likely lead a hopeful China into the depths of real turmoil."

In the face of a situation that was becoming more serious by the day, Comrade Zhao Ziyang took advantage of the opportunity to meet Gorbachev on May 16 to deliberately direct the focus of the struggle towards Comrade Deng Xiaoping, further exacerbating the situation. At the beginning of the meeting, he said, "On the most important issues, we still need Comrade Deng Xiaoping to take the helm. Since the 13th National Congress, whenever we deal with the most major issues, we always report to Comrade Deng Xiaoping and seek his advice." He also said that this was the first time he had publicly revealed this "decision" of the Party. The next day, Yan Jiaqi, Bao Zunxin, and others issued an extremely arrogant and vicious "May 17 Declaration." They cursed, saying, "Because the dictator holds unlimited power, the government has lost its responsibility and humanity," and "The Qing Dynasty has been dead for 76 years, but China still has an emperor without the title, an old and confused dictator." They said without hesitation, "Yesterday afternoon, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang publicly announced that all decisions in China must go through this old dictator." They shouted hysterically, "The era of old men in politics must end! The dictator must step down!" For this extremely reactionary clamor, some newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan also responded in kind. The Hong Kong Fast Report published an article titled "Down with Deng, Down with Li, but Not Down with Zhao" on May 18, saying that Zhao Ziyang's speech was full of implications, and the current chaos in the country was all due to Deng Xiaoping taking the helm. It said, "Now the public is clamoring to overthrow Deng and Li, and the role that Zhao Ziyang is playing is quite clear." It also said, "If the overthrow of Deng is successful and China's reforms can indeed move towards an enlightened and legal path and achieve democracy, this is good news for Hong Kong." Amidst this clamor, slogans and banners calling for the overthrow of Deng Xiaoping and attacking Li Peng were everywhere, some demanding "Deng Xiaoping step down," and others proposing "Li Peng step down, thank you for governing the country." At the same time, slogans and banners such as "Support Zhao Ziyang," "Long live Zhao Ziyang," and "Zhao Ziyang promoted to Chairman of the Military Commission" were rampant in the marching crowds and Tiananmen Square. The instigators of the turmoil attempted to seize power in the chaos. They distributed leaflets, claiming to establish the "Beijing Municipal People's Representatives Conference Preparatory Committee" to replace the Municipal People's Congress, and advocated the establishment of the "Beijing District Government" to replace the legitimate Beijing Municipal People's Government. They attacked the State Council, which was elected by law, as a "fake government," and spread rumors that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and more than ten other ministries had "declared independence," severed ties with the State Council, and that more than 30 countries had severed diplomatic relations with China. They also spread rumors that "Deng Xiaoping has stepped down," so some people carried coffins in procession, burned effigies of Deng Xiaoping, and set off firecrackers to celebrate their "victory."

The situation in the capital became more and more serious, anarchism spread maliciously, and many places were in chaos and white terror. In this situation, if our Party and government did not take decisive and resolute measures, it would again seriously miss the opportunity and cause irreparable damage, which the broad masses of the people would absolutely not allow.

Six, the imposition of martial law in some areas of Beijing was a correct and necessary measure. To ensure the social stability of Beijing, to safeguard the lives and property of citizens, and to ensure that the central state organs and the Beijing Municipal Government can carry out their duties normally, in the face of the severe shortage of police in Beijing, which could no longer maintain normal production, work, and living order, according to the authority granted by Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China, the State Council decided to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing. This was a measure taken out of necessity and a decisive and correct decision.

On May 19, the Central Committee convened a meeting of cadres from the Party, government, and military in the capital, announcing the decision to take further decisive measures to stop the turmoil. Comrade Zhao Ziyang stubbornly insisted on an erroneous stance that opposed the Central Committee's correct decision, refusing to speak at the meeting with Comrade Li Peng, refusing to preside over the meeting, and even refusing to attend the meeting, publicly revealing his split with the Party in front of the entire Party, the country, and the world.

Before this, on May 17, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee discussed the issue of imposing martial law in some areas of Beijing. A few people who held the core secrets of the Party and the state, out of counterrevolutionary political needs, leaked the martial law secret that day. A person working close to Comrade Zhao Ziyang told the leaders of the illegal student organizations that the army was going to "suppress" them, everyone agreed except Zhao Ziyang, and they should be prepared. On the evening of the 17th, Bao Tong convened part of the staff of the Central Political System Reform Research Office, after leaking the martial law secret, gave a "farewell speech," warning the attendees not to leak the conspiracy and planning of the meeting to others, otherwise they would be "traitors," "Judas." On May 19, it was Gao Shan, the deputy director of the Political System Reform Research Office, who rushed to the Economic System Reform Research Institute, conveying the so-called "instructions from above." Subsequently, under the leadership of Chen Yizhi (director of the Economic System Reform Research Institute), using the names of the Economic System Reform Research Institute, the Development Research Center of the State Council, the Beijing Youth Economic Association, and the China International Economic Consultants, Inc., a "Six-Point Statement on the Current Situation" was drafted and broadcast on Tiananmen Square, and widely distributed. The "Statement" demanded the "public disclosure of the decision-making process and differences at the high level," the "convening of a special session of the National People's Congress," and the "convening of a special session of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China." It also instructed the students on Tiananmen Square to "quickly end the hunger strike," hinting that the government would "take extreme measures (martial law)." Subsequently, some people claiming to be from the "Reform Commission" rushed to Tiananmen Square, giving speeches, saying that with "extremely sad and indignant hearts, they announced an absolutely true piece of news, General Secretary Zhao Ziyang has been dismissed," urging the nation to go on strike, go on hunger strike, go on a market strike, and incite the masses to "immediately take action and fight to the death." This speech was quickly printed as a "People's Daily Extra" and widely distributed. That evening, in public places such as Beijing Railway Station Square, leaflets titled "Suggestions on the Strategy of the Student Movement" were found, instructing that "at present, hunger strike negotiations are no longer our means and demands, we should change to peaceful sit-ins, and clearly propose new political demands and slogans, namely: (1) Zhao Ziyang cannot leave; (2) immediately convene a special session of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China; (3) immediately convene a special session of the National People's Congress." It also said, "Do not adopt an anxious and frightened attitude towards the arrival of the army like a startled bird," and "this attitude and method of dealing with the army should be repeatedly explained and propagated to the students before their arrival." Some of the leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation" and the "Workers' Autonomy Federation" who have been arrested and sentenced also confessed that on the afternoon of May 19, around 4:00 PM, someone claiming to be a staff member of a central organ, with a note, went to the "Tiananmen Square Command Center," revealing the imminent imposition of martial law. It was precisely a few people who held the core secrets of the Party and the state who, in close collaboration with the organizers and planners of the turmoil, enabled them to timely adjust their strategies, announce the change from hunger strike to sit-in 45 minutes before the Central Committee convened the meeting of cadres from the Party, government, and military in the capital, creating the illusion that since the students had stopped the hunger strike, the government had no need to impose martial law, to deceive the masses; to timely organize forces, to coerce those who did not know the truth, to set up barricades at major intersections, to intercept military vehicles; to continue to organize public opinion, to confuse and disturb the people's minds. On the one hand, they maliciously cursed the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries, saying, "We do not want the wisdom and experience of Deng Xiaoping," on the other hand, they greatly praised Comrade Zhao Ziyang, saying, "Without Zhao Ziyang, the Party is hopeless, the country is hopeless," calling for "Give us back Zhao Ziyang." They also plotted to gather forces to create greater turmoil, claiming to mobilize 200,000 people to occupy Tiananmen Square, to organize a city-wide general strike on May 20, and to cooperate with Zhao Ziyang's request for sick leave for three days on May 19, threatening that three days later they would establish a "new government."

In this extremely urgent situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission resolutely decided to order the martial law troops stationed around the capital to forcefully enter the city and suppress the counterrevolutionary rebellion. However, due to our decision being known in advance by the organizers and planners of the turmoil, the troops entering the city still encountered great difficulties and obstacles. On the eve of martial law and the first two days after martial law was imposed, all major traffic intersections were blocked, more than 220 buses were hijacked and used as barricades, traffic was paralyzed, and various martial law troops could not enter their designated positions on time. The headquarters of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council continued to be besieged, street incitement speeches were seen everywhere, leaflets spreading rumors were everywhere, and tens of thousands of marches and demonstrations continued uninterrupted, plunging the capital, Beijing, into chaos and terror. In the following days, the martial law troops adopted different methods to gradually enter the city, and the broad ranks of the armed police, public security officers, and the masses organized by various districts and suburban areas, established a group of about 120,000 people to maintain order in the capital, and the suburban counties also mobilized the militia. Through the joint efforts of the military, police, and people, the transportation and production and living order of the capital gradually improved, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. However, the activities of a few people to create turmoil did not stop for a single day, the goal of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party did not change at all, and the situation was developing day by day towards a counterrevolutionary rebellion.

After martial law was imposed, one of the important strategies of the organizers and planners of the turmoil was to continue to occupy Tiananmen Square and not leave. They wanted to use the square as the "center of the student movement and even the entire nation," and if the government made any decision, they would be prepared to react strongly on the square, "to form an anti-government united front." They had long planned to provoke a bloody incident on the square, believing that "as long as they do not withdraw from the square, the government will suppress them," and "blood can awaken the people, causing the government to split and collapse." To support the situation on the square, they relied on financial support from domestic and foreign reactionary forces to continuously improve facilities, equip advanced communication tools, spending more than 100,000 yuan a day, and began to illegally purchase weapons. They relied on the support of the Hong Kong support team to set up tents on the square, establishing the so-called "Freedom Village," opening the so-called "Democracy University," claiming to make it a "new era's Whampoa Military Academy." They also erected a statue of a "Goddess of Freedom" in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, originally called the "Statue of Liberty," later renamed the "Goddess of Democracy," using American democracy and freedom as their spiritual pillar. Liu Xiaobo and other behind-the-scenes planners, fearing that the students sitting in protest would not be able to persist, personally took to the front stage, staging a 48-hour to 72-hour hunger strike farce to cheer on and encourage the young students. They said, "As long as the flag on the square does not fall, we can persist in the struggle, radiate throughout the country, until the government collapses."

The organizers and planners of the turmoil, taking advantage of the government and the troops' continued restraint after martial law was imposed, continued to organize various illegal activities. After the "High Autonomy Federation," "Workers' Autonomy Federation," "Hunger Strike Group," "Tiananmen Square Command Center," and "Capital Intellectuals Joint Conference" and other illegal organizations, they successively established the "Capital All-Circles Patriotic Constitutional Conference" and the "Beijing Citizens' Self-Government Federation" and other illegal organizations. They used the names of the Economic System Reform Research Institute, the Development Research Center of the State Council, the Beijing Youth Economic Association, and others to openly send telegrams to some troops, inciting and subverting. They organized a special propaganda team, set up underground newspapers, and engaged in underground activities to subvert the government. They formed cliques, collectively conducted underground oaths, vowing "never to betray their conscience, never to surrender to autocracy, never to submit to the emperor of the 1980s in China." Wan Runnan, the general manager of the Beijing Starlight Group, convened a meeting with some leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation" at the International Hotel, proposing six conditions for withdrawing from Tiananmen Square, namely, "the army withdraws, martial law is lifted, Li Peng steps down, Deng Xiaoping and Yang Shangkun retire, Zhao Ziyang returns," and preparing to organize the so-called "victorious march at midnight." Especially serious was that they believed that after Comrade Zhao Ziyang left the position of General Secretary due to illness, the hope of solving problems within the Party had become bleak, and they turned to hoping for the convening of an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Yan Jiaqi, Bao Zunxin, and others sent a telegram to the leaders of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, saying, "At present, the Constitution is being trampled upon by a few people, we urgently suggest that an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress be convened immediately to solve the serious problems at hand." With the support and instructions of a certain member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute issued a "Proposal to Immediately Convene an Emergency Meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress," collecting the signatures of some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and also sending urgent telegrams to some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in other places. They used conspiratorial means to send letters and telegrams to some members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, only talking about the suggestion to convene a meeting, but not talking about their real intentions, attempting to deceive some comrades who did not know the truth, and even stealing their names, adding them to their schemes. After doing these things, Yan Jiaqi and Bao Zunxin published "Solving the Current Problems of China on the Track of Democracy and the Rule of Law - A Letter to Li Peng" in the Hong Kong Ming Pao, calling on "every member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, every representative of the National People's Congress, to cast a sacred vote, to abolish the martial law order, and to remove Li Peng from his position as Premier."

The organizers and planners of the turmoil also brazenly incited and organized violent actions. They gathered local hooligans, roaming criminals, and unrehabilitated released criminals, and gathered those who had deep hatred for the Communist Party and the socialist system, forming so-called "suicide squads," "tiger squads," and "volunteer armies" and other terrorist organizations, vowing to kidnap and abduct Party and state leaders, to use the method of "storming the Bastille" to seize power. They distributed leaflets inciting armed counterrevolutionary rebellion, advocating that "a single spark can start a prairie fire," calling for the organization of "armed forces that may be called the people's army," and "uniting all kinds of forces, including the Kuomintang in Taiwan," and "not hesitating to shed blood, clearly opposing the Communist Party and its government." They threatened, "we will settle accounts in the autumn, we must settle accounts with the Party, we must settle accounts with the government," and prepared a list of officials to be suppressed. The Hong Kong Ming Pao also published a dialogue between Liu Xiaobo, one of the organizers and planners of the turmoil, and a so-called "leader of the mainland democracy movement" on June 2, openly shouting, "we hope that Zhao Ziyang will return, and we must organize armed forces among the people."

The activities of the instigators of the turmoil all had substantial financial backing. In addition to the material support of tens of millions of yuan from units such as the Beijing Starlight Group, they also received financial and material support from overseas hostile forces and some organizations and individuals. The United States, Britain, and Hong Kong provided hundreds of thousands of US dollars and tens of millions of Hong Kong dollars. Part of this money was used to sabotage martial law activities. Each person participating in setting up barricades and intercepting military vehicles received 30 yuan per day. At the same time, they offered high prices to buy thugs to burn military vehicles and beat soldiers, promising 3,000 yuan for burning one military vehicle and several thousand yuan for capturing or killing a soldier. A military and political figure in Taiwan initiated the "Send Love to Tiananmen" movement, leading the way with a donation of 100,000 Taiwan dollars. A member of the Kuomintang Central Committee initiated a fundraiser of 100 million Taiwan dollars, establishing the so-called "Fund for Supporting the Democratic Movement on the Mainland." The art and culture circles in Taiwan launched the "Blood Is Thicker Than Water, Support the Democratic Movement on the Mainland." The "High Autonomy Federation" in Beijing sent a letter to "Taiwanese friends in the art and cultural circles," saying, "At this critical moment, we learned that the Taiwanese art and cultural circles stood up," and "provided us with the urgently needed materials and spiritual support, for which we express our heartfelt thanks and respect."

All of this shows that the turmoil planned, organized, and carried out by a small number of people was absolutely not like what kind-hearted people imagined, that as long as the government made some concessions, it could be pacified, or that issuing a martial law order could solve the problem. They were determined to join forces with hostile forces overseas and abroad to fight to the death with us. The longer the time dragged on, the greater the price paid.

Seven, how a small number of people instigated a counterrevolutionary rebellion.

The People's Liberation Army not only bears the sacred mission of "consolidating national defense, resisting aggression, and defending the motherland," but also bears the glorious mission of "protecting the peaceful labor of the people, participating in the construction of the state, and striving to serve the people," which is clearly stipulated in Article 29 of the Constitution. The troops entering the city to maintain social order are precisely carrying out the tasks assigned by the Constitution.

After the announcement of martial law in some areas of the capital on May 20, despite encountering numerous obstacles, the troops still entered the city according to the predetermined plan, adopting different methods to gradually enter the city. The few organizers and planners of the rebellion knew that if the troops executing the martial law mission were all in place according to the plan, then their various illegal activities and counterrevolutionary activities would no longer be able to continue, and their entire conspiracy would soon end in failure. Therefore, they waited for the opportunity, deliberately provoked incidents, and tried to make the turmoil worse, eventually developing into a counterrevolutionary rebellion. On June 1, the public security organs of our country arrested several leaders of the illegal organization "Workers' Autonomy Federation," and they took the opportunity to incite some people to besiege and attack the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and the Ministry of Public Security. On the evening of June 2, Central Television borrowed a jeep from the armed police unit for 10 months, and on the way back to the original unit, due to the car speeding and the road being slippery, it caused an accident, crashing and killing people, but none of them were students. This was originally a traffic accident, and the relevant departments were handling it, but a few people deliberately linked it with the martial law troops entering the city according to the plan, spreading rumors, saying that the martial law troops' advance car deliberately ran over students, inciting those who did not know the truth to seize the corpses and hold a funeral procession. For a time, people's hearts were unsettled, and the atmosphere was tense. After such incitement and noise, the fire of the rebellion was ignited by them.

On the early morning of June 3, when part of the martial law troops were entering the designated positions according to the plan, some people organized some people to block large and small vehicles at Jianwai Gate, Nanhe Street, Xidan, Muzidong, and other intersections, set up barricades, intercept military vehicles, and beat soldiers, seize military supplies. Near Caojia Village, 12 military vehicles were intercepted. Soldiers passing by the front door of the Beijing Hotel were forcibly searched. The military vehicles in front of the Telegraph Building had their tires punctured and were surrounded by isolation piles.

Before dawn, the military vehicles at Yongdingmen Bridge were overturned. The tires of the military vehicles at Muzidong were punctured. More than 400 soldiers entering the city near Chaoyangmen were beaten with stones. At Six Departments and Heng'er Street, military vehicles were intercepted, and soldiers were besieged.

Around 7:00 AM, at Six Departments, some thugs crawled into the besieged military vehicles, seizing machine guns loaded with bullets. From Jianwai Gate to Dongdan, and near Qianmen, the troops entering the city were cut off in small groups and attacked. On Jianwai Gate Flyover, some soldiers' clothes were torn off, and some soldiers were beaten all over. In the afternoon, the troops entering the city at Hufangqiao were attacked, and soldiers were severely beaten. Some of the injured soldiers were intercepted on their way to the hospital, the tires of the ambulance were deflated, and the injured were kidnapped. From Hufang Road to Taoran Park, 21 military vehicles were besieged, and when the soldiers were transferring ammunition, the accompanying police were beaten.

At noon, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who were blocked at Furong Street South, Yizhong Road North, Xuanwu Gate, Hufangqiao, Muzidong, Dongsi, and other intersections were beaten, and their helmets, military caps, raincoats, water bottles, and bags were stolen. At Six Departments, a group of people intercepted a military vehicle loaded with weapons and ammunition. The armed police and public security officers tried to rescue it several times but failed. If the weapons and ammunition on the car were stolen or exploded, the consequences would be unimaginable. To protect the lives and property of the people of the capital, in an extremely urgent situation, the armed police fired tear gas, dispersed the crowd, and rescued the ammunition car.

While intercepting and smashing military vehicles, a group of thugs besieged and attacked state organs and important departments. They stormed the Great Hall of the People, the Propaganda Department, the Broadcasting and Television Department, and the west and south gates of Zhongnanhai. Dozens of armed police and public security officers guarding these organs were injured.

As the situation worsened, the instigators of the rebellion became more and more arrogant. Around 5:00 PM, the leaders of the illegal organizations "High Autonomy Federation" and "Workers' Autonomy Federation" distributed knives, daggers, iron bars, chains, and bamboo spears with points on Tiananmen Square, vowing to "beat the soldiers and police to death if they are caught." The "Workers' Autonomy Federation" broadcasted on the radio, inciting to "take up weapons and overthrow the government." Another group of thugs gathered more than a thousand people, knocked down the wall of a construction site near Xidan, looted a large number of construction tools and steel bars, bricks, and other materials, preparing for street fighting. Their broadcasting station continuously broadcasted how to make and use Molotov cocktails and how to block and burn military vehicles, inciting and provoking. They planned to take advantage of the fact that the next day was a Sunday to incite more people to take to the streets, launch a larger-scale beating, smashing, looting, and burning, creating a situation of mass uprising, and overthrow the government and seize power in one go.

It was precisely at this extremely urgent moment that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission had to make a resolute decision to order the martial law troops stationed around the capital to forcefully enter the city and suppress the counterrevolutionary rebellion.

Eight, how the counterrevolutionary thugs massacred the People's Liberation Army.

Since the imposition of martial law, the troops entering the city according to the central instructions have always maintained a highly restrained attitude, trying to avoid conflicts as much as possible. After the rebellion broke out on June 3, before the troops entered the city, in order to avoid harming the people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Martial Law Command issued an "Emergency Announcement" at 6:30 PM, requiring "all citizens to be vigilant, from now on, please do not go out, do not go to Tiananmen Square. All workers should stay at their posts, citizens should stay at home, to ensure your safety." This "Announcement" was repeatedly broadcasted through radio, television, and various loudspeakers.

Around 10:00 PM on June 3, the various martial law troops entering the city according to orders entered the city. However, at all major intersections, they encountered serious obstacles. Even in this situation, the troops still adopted an extremely restrained attitude. However, the counterrevolutionary thugs, with deep hatred for the People's Liberation Army, took advantage of this restraint to launch a horrifying beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing.

From 10:00 PM to 11:00 PM, from Cuimiyu Road, Gongzhufeng, Muzidong to Xidan, 12 military vehicles were burned. Some people used trucks to transport bricks and stones to beat the soldiers. Some thugs pushed trams to the intersections, set them on fire, and blocked the roads. Some fire trucks rushed to extinguish the fire but were smashed and burned.

Around 11:00 PM, three military vehicles were smashed at Hufangqiao, and one jeep was overturned. The military vehicles at Andingmen Flyover were besieged. A regiment of soldiers at Chengwenmen Street was besieged. Thirty military vehicles at Jianwai Gate Flyover were besieged. More than 300 military vehicles west of Beijing Coal Industry School were besieged. To ensure the military vehicles could move forward, some soldiers and commanders got off the vehicles to do traffic control work, but they were besieged and beaten, and some were forcibly kidnapped, their whereabouts unknown. Some of the injured, including officers and generals, were beaten all over. The military vehicles at Nanquan Gate, which were obstructed, took a detour to the east to avoid conflict, and were again blocked at the south gate of Tian Tan Park. Many military vehicles were smashed and burned. At Zhushikou, a military vehicle was blocked, and a group of people climbed onto the vehicle. A person who looked like an official tried to persuade them to come down but was immediately beaten, and his fate was unknown.

After midnight on June 4, the atrocity of burning military vehicles became more and more serious. At Tian Tan Park East Road, Tian Tan North Gate, the west exit of the subway at Qianmen, Dongsi, Furong Street, Six Departments, Xidan, Fuxingmen, Nanqishilu, Muzidong, Lianhuachi, Chegongzhuang, Donghuamen, Dongzhimen, and in the Dabeiying, Hujiayuan, and Beidouqiaozhuang areas of Chaoyang District, and the old palace of Daxing County, hundreds of military vehicles at dozens of intersections were set on fire by thugs using gasoline, Molotov cocktails, and homemade flamethrowers. The flames soared, and some soldiers were burned to death in the vehicles, while others were beaten to death after jumping out of the vehicles. In some places, several, dozens, or even dozens of military vehicles were burned at the same time, creating a sea of fire. At the intersection of Shuangjing, more than 70 armored vehicles were besieged, and more than 20 machine guns on the vehicles were dismantled by thugs. From the intersection of Jingyuan to the west of the crematorium, more than 30 military vehicles were burned to ashes by thugs, and the scene was filled with thick smoke. Some thugs held iron bars, pushing gasoline drums, blocking intersections, and burning vehicles as they saw them. Many military supply trucks and clothing trucks were hijacked by thugs, and their whereabouts were unknown. A few thugs in the Fuxingmen Flyover area drove a stolen armored vehicle, shooting as they moved. The illegal organization "Workers' Autonomy Federation" also broadcasted on the radio that they had seized a military radio and a codebook.

While smashing and burning military vehicles, some thugs launched attacks on civilian facilities and public buildings. The display windows of shops such as Yanshan in Xicheng District were smashed. The pine wall in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes and the west side of the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall were set on fire. Some public buses, fire trucks, ambulances, and taxis were smashed and burned. Especially vicious was that a group of people drove a public bus filled with gasoline towards Tiananmen City Tower, intending to set the tower on fire, but were intercepted in time by the martial law troops at Jinshui Bridge South.

What was particularly intolerable was that the thugs not only launched a frenzied attack on military vehicles, engaging in beating, smashing, looting, and burning, but also launched a brutal massacre of the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, with extremely cruel and barbaric methods.

On the early morning of June 4, at the intersection of Dongdan, a group of thugs used bottles, bricks, and bicycles to beat and hack at the soldiers, and many soldiers were covered in blood. At Fuxingmen, a military vehicle was intercepted, and the management section chief, management personnel, and cooks of a certain unit, 12 people, were pulled out of the vehicle, forcibly searched, and then beaten, with many seriously injured. At Six Departments, four soldiers were besieged and beaten, and some were killed on the spot. Near Guangqumen, three soldiers were beaten, and only one was rescued by the crowd, while the other two were missing. In the West City District, Xingxing Hutong, more than 20 armed police soldiers were beaten by a group of thugs, and some were seriously injured, while others were missing. At Huguosi, a military vehicle was intercepted, and the soldiers were pulled out and beaten, and then taken hostage, and a batch of submachine guns were stolen. A truck loaded with bricks, driven from Dongjiaominxiang to Tiananmen Square, had people shouting, "Anyone who is Chinese, come up and smash the People's Liberation Army."

After dawn, the atrocity of massacring the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army reached a horrifying level. An ambulance of the Armed Police Regiment, carrying eight injured soldiers to a nearby hospital, was intercepted by a group of thugs, and one soldier was beaten to death on the spot, and they shouted to beat the remaining seven to death. In front of a bicycle shop on Qianmen Street, three soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were beaten to a pulp, and the thugs surrounded them, shouting, "Anyone who dares to save them will be beaten to death." On Chang'an Street, a military vehicle stalled, and more than a hundred thugs rushed up, smashed the driver's compartment, and beat the driver to death. At the intersection of Xichang'an Street, about 30 meters east of Xidan, a soldier was beaten to death, and gasoline was poured on his body and burned. At Chaoyangmen, a soldier was massacred by thugs, and his body was hung on the railing of the flyover. At Chongwenmen, a soldier was thrown down from an overpass by a group of thugs, poured with gasoline, and burned to death, and the thugs shouted, "This is a lantern festival." Near the Capital Cinema on Xichang'an Street, a military officer was beaten to death by thugs, disemboweled, and his eyes gouged out, and his body was hung on a burning public bus.

In the days of the rebellion, more than 1,280 military vehicles, police vehicles, and public buses were smashed, burned, and damaged, including more than 1,000 military vehicles, more than 60 armored vehicles, more than 30 police vehicles, more than 120 public buses, and more than 70 other vehicles. A batch of weapons and ammunition were stolen. More than 6,000 soldiers of the martial law troops, armed police soldiers, and public security officers were injured, and dozens were killed. They sacrificed their blood and even their precious lives to defend the motherland, defend the Constitution, and defend the people. Their merits will be forever remembered by the people.

Such a heavy price most powerfully illustrates the extreme tolerance and restraint of the martial law troops. The People's Liberation Army is a military force led by the Communist Party of China, serving the people wholeheartedly. This military force is ruthless to the enemy and kind to the people, as it has always been. They were able to defeat the 800,000 troops of the Kuomintang armed by American imperialism and the American imperialists armed to the teeth in the war years, effectively defending our country's sacred territory, territorial waters, and airspace. Why, then, did they cause such heavy casualties in suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion? Why did they have weapons in their hands but still get beaten and even killed? As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, "It is because good people and bad people are mixed together, making it difficult for us to take decisive measures." This also shows that the People's Liberation Army loves the people and does not want to harm the people. They endured humiliation and went to their deaths, fully embodying the essence of the people's army. Otherwise, how could such heavy casualties and losses have occurred? Does this not show that our military is willing to sacrifice itself to protect the people? And in the end, to suppress the counterrevolutionary rebellion and avoid greater losses, the martial law troops, in the face of severe injuries, unbearable humiliation, and great difficulty in advancing, after repeated warnings, had no choice but to follow orders to fire into the air to clear the way and counterattack, killing some rampaging thugs. Due to the large number of onlookers, some were hit by cars, trampled by the crowd, some were injured or killed by stray bullets, and some were shot and killed by armed thugs. According to the current situation, more than 3,000 non-military personnel were injured during the rebellion, and more than 200 died, including 36 college students. Among them, there were guilty thugs, innocent bystanders, and medical personnel, neighborhood watch members, and order-maintenance team members who were on duty at the scene. The government will do a good job of handling the aftermath for those who were mistakenly injured and harmed while on duty.

Due to the rumors spread by "Voice of America" and some people deliberately spreading rumors, there was a time when society widely circulated that after the martial law troops entered the city, they "bloodily suppressed Tiananmen Square," and "thousands of people, even tens of thousands of people, were killed in a pool of blood." The actual situation is that after the martial law troops entered the square, at 1:30 AM, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Martial Law Command issued an emergency announcement: "A serious counterrevolutionary rebellion occurred in the capital tonight," and "all citizens and students on Tiananmen Square should immediately leave to ensure the martial law troops can carry out their mission." This emergency announcement was repeatedly broadcasted through loudspeakers for more than three hours. At this time, the young students who were sitting in protest on the square were concentrated in the south end of the square, near the Monument to the People's Heroes. Around 3:00 AM, after internal consultation, they sent representatives to the martial law troops to express their willingness to leave the square voluntarily, and the martial law troops immediately agreed. At 4:30 AM, the broadcast of the Martial Law Command announced, "The clearing of the square will begin now, and the appeal for students to leave the square is agreed to." At the same time, the announcement of the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the Martial Law Command on the rapid restoration of normal order on Tiananmen Square was broadcasted. The thousands of young students who were staying on the square heard the announcement, carrying their flags and banners, and set up a hand-in-hand patrol team on both sides, leaving the square around 5:00 AM. To ensure the safe withdrawal of the students, the martial law troops opened a wide passage on the south side of the east entrance of the square, ensuring that the students left safely and peacefully. At this time, there were still some students who insisted on not leaving, and the martial law troops, according to the requirements of the "Announcement," forcibly removed them from the square. By 5:30 AM, the clearing task was completely finished. The students who were sitting in protest on the square, including those who were forcibly removed, did not have a single death. Some people spread rumors that the square was "a river of blood," and they themselves were "crawling out of a pile of corpses," which was all nonsense.

With the return of Tiananmen Square to the people and the martial law troops fully in place, the counterrevolutionary rebellion in the capital was crushed in one go. In the process of suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the People's Liberation Army, the armed police, and the public security officers fought bravely without fear of sacrifice, creating immortal merits. The people rescued the injured, rescued the besieged soldiers, actively cooperated with and supported the martial law troops, and many moving stories emerged. Due to the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion, Beijing's economy suffered huge losses, and other losses were even more difficult to calculate in terms of money. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals are working hard to make up for the losses suffered. Now, the various orders in the capital have basically returned to normal, and the situation across the country has also quickly stabilized, reflecting that the correct decisions of the Central Committee have been supported by the people of all ethnic groups across the country. However, the turmoil and rebellion have not been completely suppressed, and a few counterrevolutionary rebels, unwilling to perish, are still carrying out various sabotage activities, even dreaming of a comeback.

To achieve a complete victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion, we must mobilize the masses, strengthen people's democratic dictatorship, and carry out the work of investigating and punishing the counterrevolutionary rebels to the end. We must thoroughly expose the conspiracy of the turmoil and rebellion, punish the organizers and planners of the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion according to law, that is, those who have long stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois liberalization stance and engaged in political conspiracies, those who have colluded with hostile forces overseas and abroad, those who have provided the Party and state with core secrets to illegal organizations, and those who have committed criminal acts such as beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing. We must strictly distinguish and correctly handle two different types of contradictions, through resolute, decisive, and painstaking work, concentrate on striking a few ringleaders and unrepentant stubborn elements, and strive to expand the scope of education and unity. On this basis, relying on the broad masses of the people, we will strive to increase production, practice thrift, work hard, and quickly make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion.

Chairman, Vice Chairmen, and Commissioners!

Our country's just struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counterrevolutionary rebellion has been understood and supported by the governments and peoples of many countries in the world. For this, we express our heartfelt thanks. However, there are also some countries in the international community, mainly the United States and some countries in Western Europe, that have distorted the facts, spread rumors and slander, and even imposed various so-called condemnations and sanctions on us, stirring up an anti-China wave and grossly interfering in our internal affairs. For this, we express deep regret. For all external pressures, our country's government and people have never yielded in the past, will not yield now, and will never yield in the future. Rumors will eventually be exposed, and the truth will eventually be revealed to the world. Our country will unswervingly take economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to reform and opening up. Our country will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy, develop friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and continue to make its own contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting world development.

    关于制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的情况报告
    （1989年6月30日）
    国务委员、北京市市长　陈希同
    委员长、各位副委员长和各位委员！
    1989年春夏之交，从4月中旬到6月上旬，极少数人利用学潮，掀起了一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在首都北京发展成了反革命暴乱。他们策动动乱和暴乱的目的，就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。这场动乱和反革命暴乱的发生和发展，有着深刻的国际背景和国内社会基础。正如邓小平同志说的：“这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的”。在这场关系党和国家生死存亡的斗争中，赵紫阳同志犯了支持动乱和分裂党的严重错误，对动乱的形成和发展负有不可推卸的责任。在极其严峻的形势面前，党中央作出了正确的决策，采取了一系列果断措施，得到了全党和全国各族人民的坚决拥护。以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家，为赢得这场斗争的胜利发挥了极其重要的作用。中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警，为制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱作出了巨大的贡献。广大工人、农民、知识分子坚决反对动乱和暴乱，紧密团结在党中央周围，表现了很高的政治觉悟和主人翁责任感。现在，我受国务院委托，就这次动乱和反革命暴乱的情况，主要是发生在北京的一些情况，以及制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的工作，向全国人民代表大会常务委员会作汇报。
    一、动乱的酝酿和预谋由来已久
    西方世界的一些政治势力，总是企图使社会主义各国包括中国都放弃社会主义道路，最终纳入国际垄断资本的统治，纳入资本主义的轨道，这是他们长期的根本战略。这些年来，他们利用社会主义国家政策上的某些失误和经济上的暂时困难，更加紧了这个战略的实施。在我国，党内党外极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场和搞政治阴谋的人，同西方国家的这种战略相呼应，内外勾结，上下串通，为在中国制造动乱，推翻共产党的领导和颠覆社会主义的人民共和国，进行了长达几年的思想、舆论和组织准备。正因为这样，在动乱的酝酿、预谋和发难的整个过程中，包括制造舆论、歪曲真相、造谣惑众等诸多手段的使用，都显示出了国内外、海内外相互策应、相互配合的鲜明特点。
    这里着重讲一讲中国共产党十三届三中全会以来的情况。去年9月，党中央提出了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针，广大群众和青年学生对这个决策和采取的各项措施是支持和拥护的。整个社会秩序和政治形势是基本稳定的。今春全国人民代表大会以绝对多数的赞成票（只两票反对、4票弃权），通过了李鹏同志所作的政府工作报告，就是一个很好的证明。当然，人民群众和青年学生对于党和政府在工作中的一些失误，一些国家公职人员中的腐败现象，以及社会上的分配不公等问题，也提出了许多批评意见，同时在推进民主、健全法制、深化改革、克服官僚主义等方面，还提出了不少的要求和建议，这些都是正常现象，也是党和政府正在采取措施加以解决的问题。但是，当时在党内和社会上的确有极少数人紧密勾结，明里暗里进行了大量极不正常的活动。
    特别引人注目的是，赵紫阳同志去年9月19日会见美国一位“极端自由派经济学家”以后，一些据称与赵紫阳“智囊团”有着密切联系的香港报刊，大肆进行宣传，透露出了“北京利用香港传媒倒邓保赵”的政治信息。反动杂志《九十年代》总编辑李怡（化名齐辛）在香港《信报》发表《大家长该退休了》的文章，叫嚣“排除超级老人政治的障碍”，“使赵紫阳有足够的权力”。《九十年代》的另一篇文章则呼吁赵成为“独裁者”。香港《解放》杂志也刊登长篇论文，说北京一些人同香港传播界某些人士有“或明或暗”、“有如鬼火高低明灭”的关系，这种微妙关系“有了一个最新的个案显示，那就是在最近一个月掀起的倒邓保赵风”，还说什么“就中国走资的希望言，他们看准了赵紫阳”。同这种“倒邓保赵”风相配合，北京《经济学周报》发表了同赵紫阳原秘书鲍彤联系密切的严家其（中国社会科学院政治学所研究员）与另一个人关于时局的对话，攻击“治理整顿”会导致“停滞”，提出中国面临的一大问题“就是不能重蹈赫鲁晓夫、刘少奇那样非程序权力更迭的覆辙”，“中国不再允许像文革那样用非程序化的方式进行权力变动”。这个对话的核心问题，就是为掩盖赵紫阳的错误、保住他的权力地位、以便更加肆无忌惮地推行资产阶级自由化制造舆论。这个对话曾经在上海《世界经济导报》和香港《镜报》等海内外多种报刊全文或摘要刊登。
    去年末今年初，内外勾结进一步加紧，陆续出现了一些观点十分错误乃至反动的政治集会、联名上书、大小字报和其他活动。比如，去年12月7日，由《走向未来丛书》副主编金观涛担任顾问的“北京大学未来学会”，举办了“未来中国与世界”的大型讨论会，金观涛在发言中说：“社会主义的尝试及其失败，是二十世纪人类的两大遗产之一。”《新观察》主编戈扬立即以一个有几十年党龄的“年龄最大”者的身份站出来“作证”说：“金观涛对社会主义的否定不是太厉害了，而是客气了一点。”今年1月28日，苏绍智（中国社会科学院马列所研究员）、方励之等人在北京的“都乐书屋”搞了一个所谓“新启蒙沙龙活动”，参加的除中国人之外，还有一些美国、法国、意大利的驻京记者，共100多人。方励之说，这类集会“对当局采取完全批判、彻底批判的态度”，“火药味很浓”，“现在需要行动”，“连开三次就要上街了”。2月初，方励之、陈军（反动组织“中国民联”成员）等人又在友谊宾馆举行了所谓的“名人名家迎春联谊会”，方励之主要就所谓“民主”和“人权”两大问题发表了演讲，陈军把“五四运动”同“西单民主墙”作了类比。方励之说：“希望企业家作为中国的新生力量，同先进的知识分子结合起来，为争民主而斗争。”2月16日，陈军举行外国记者招待会，广为散发方励之致邓小平的信，以及陈军等33人致全国人大常委和中共中央的信，要求实行大赦，释放严重触犯刑律的魏京生等所谓“政治犯”。2月23日，台湾《联合报》发表《大运动的开端，大冲击！》的文章说：“纽约发宣言，北京公开信，神州春雷动，民主浪潮涌。”2月26日，张显扬（中国社会科学院马列所研究员）、李洪林（福建社会科学院研究员）、包遵信（中国社会科学院历史所副研究员）、戈扬等42人，联名写信给中共中央，也要求释放所谓的“政治犯”。此后，北京一些大学陆续出现攻击共产党和社会主义制度的大量大小字报和集会。比如，3月1日清华大学和北京大学同时出现《讨邓檄文　告全民书》的大字报，胡说什么“共产党的政治就是空谈、强权、独裁、武断”，公然要求“取消党派，解除四项原则”。3月2日北京大学贴出题为《为中国人悲哀》的小字报，叫喊打倒“专制”和“独裁”。3月3日清华大学等院校出现署名“中国民主青年爱国会筹委会”写的《致广大青年学生的一封信》，鼓动“在爱国主义民主战士方励之的领导下，参加到‘民主、自由、人权’的激流中去”。3月29日北京大学等高等院校广为张贴方励之给香港《明报》写的《中国的失望和希望》一文，宣称社会主义已经“彻底丧失了吸引力”，要组成政治上的“压力集团”，去实行“政治民主和经济自由的改革”。他所说的“改革”，实际上就是全盘西化的代名词。4月6日北京大学贴出一份题为《时代的召唤》的大字报，以完全否定的态度提出了“社会主义还有没有存在的合理性”以及“马列主义到底还适合不适合我国的国情”的问题。4月13日北京邮电学院等校收到署名“广西大学学生会”写的《告全国大学生书》，号召“高举胡耀邦的画像和‘民主、自由、尊严、法治’的大旗”，来纪念“五四”青年节。与此同时，在北京的一些高等院校，所谓的“民主沙龙”、“自由论坛”以及各式各样的“研究会”、“讨论会”、“演讲会”纷纷出现，仅北大学生王丹主持的“民主沙龙”一年就搞了17场讲座，活动十分频繁。他们曾经把原非法组织“人权同盟”的头头任畹町请去，围绕所谓“新权威主义与民主政治”，散布了许多谬论。他们曾在塞万提斯像前举办讨论会，公开宣称“要废除一党制，让共产党下台，推翻现政权”。他们还把方励之的妻子李淑娴请去，充当他们的“军师”。李淑娴煽动说：“要使民主沙龙合法化”，“要经常在这里集会”，“要取消北京市关于游行的十条规定”。所有这些，都为后来发生的动乱做了思想和组织上的准备。香港《明报》载文评论说：“中国知识分子精英阶层争取人权而发起的串联与签名运动，已对学生产生极大影响，他们早已在酝酿于‘五四’运动七十周年纪念日采取大规模的行动表达对当局的不满。胡耀邦的猝然去世，则犹如装满火药的桶里扔了一根火柴。”总之，在极少数人的预谋、组织和策划下，当时已经形成了一个“山雨欲来风满楼”的政治形势。
    二、学潮从一开始就被动乱的组织者所利用
    4月15日胡耀邦同志逝世，使酝酿已久的学潮和动乱提前爆发。广大群众和青年学生悼念胡耀邦同志，表达了深切的哀思，各高校也为学生的悼念活动提供了条件。但是，极少数人却利用这个时机，以“悼念”为借口，反对共产党的领导，反对社会主义制度。学潮从一开始就被极少数人所操纵和利用，具有了政治动乱的性质。
    这场动乱，首先表现在大量的大小字报、标语、口号、传单和挽联等，对党和政府进行了肆意的攻击和诋毁，公然号召推翻共产党的领导，颠覆现政权。北京大学、清华大学等院校的一些大小字报，有的谩骂共产党是“一代奸党”，“是个即将溃灭之组织”；有的攻击老一辈革命家是“朽翁听政”、“独裁集权”；有的指名道姓地逐个攻击中央领导同志，胡说什么“不该去的去了，该死的却没死”；有的要求“撤换无能政府，推翻专制君主”；有的要求“取消共产党，实行多党制”，“取消各团体、军队、学校、单位的党支部和政工干部”；有的发表《私有制宣言》，号召“早日敲响公有制的丧钟，去迎接共和国新的明天”；有的还提出要“邀请国民党回大陆，建立两党政治”，等等。许多大小字报用不堪入耳的语言，诬蔑邓小平同志，叫嚷“打倒邓小平”。
    这场动乱，从一开始就表现为资产阶级自由化同四项基本原则的尖锐对立。动乱策划者们这个期间提出的纲领性口号，无论是通过非法学生组织的头头王丹在天安门广场首先提出的“九条要求”，还是后来提出的“七条”、“十条”等等，其中最主要的是两条：一是，重新评价胡耀邦同志的是非功过；二是，彻底否定反对资产阶级自由化，为反自由化中所谓“蒙受不白之冤的公民”平反昭雪。这两条的实质，就是要在中国取得反对四项基本原则、实现资本主义化的绝对自由。同这种要求相配合，一些知识界的所谓“精英”分子，也就是顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的极少数人，在此期间也组织种种座谈会，利用舆论阵地大肆宣传，其中最突出的是《世界经济导报》和《新观察》杂志社4月19日在北京召开的座谈会。这个座谈会由戈扬主持，参加的有严家其、苏绍智、陈子明（北京社会经济科学研究所所长）、刘锐绍（香港文汇报驻北京办事处主任）等人。他们议论的中心也是两个，一是为胡耀邦“平反”，二是为反自由化“翻案”，并且明确表示支持学生的游行示威，说什么由此“看到了中国的前途和希望”。后来，当上海市委作出整顿《世界经济导报》的正确决定之后，一贯纵容资产阶级自由化的赵紫阳同志不仅不予支持，反而指责上海市委把事情“搞糟了”，“搞被动了”。
    这场动乱，还表现为在极少数人的挑唆和策划下，许多行为都是极其粗暴的，是违背中华人民共和国的宪法、法律和法规的，是严重反民主反法制的。他们不顾宪法对“四大”的废除，不听劝阻，在校园内铺天盖地地张贴大字报；他们不顾北京市人大常委会关于游行的十条规定，不经申请批准，连日不断地举行大游行；他们在4月18日和19日深夜接连冲击党中央、国务院所在地新华门，并且呼喊“打倒共产党”的口号，这是“文化大革命”中都未曾发生过的事情；他们违反天安门广场的管理规定，多次强行占据广场，4月22日那一天几乎造成胡耀邦同志追悼会无法正常进行；他们无视北京市的有关法规，不经登记就成立了“团结学生会”（后改名为“高等院校学生自治联合会”）等非法组织，并且向经过民主选举产生的合法的学生会和研究生会“夺权”；他们不顾法纪和校纪，抢占办公室，抢占广播站，想怎么干就怎么干，在校园里造成了严重的无政府状态。
    大量制造谣言，蛊惑人心，煽动群众，是极少数动乱组织者和策划者采用的另一个重要手法。学潮之初，他们就造谣说，“李鹏在政治局会议上大骂胡耀邦，胡是被气死的”，诱导人们把矛头指向李鹏同志。事实上，那次政治局会议讨论的是教育问题，当政治局委员、国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映同志正在就有关文件作说明时，胡耀邦同志突然心脏病暴发，立即就地进行抢救，缓解后被送进医院，根本没有什么生气的事。4月19日夜间，一位师大外语系的女学生在参加晚会后回校途中，被无轨电车撞伤，经抢救无效，不幸身亡，有人就造谣说：“共产党的军警开车轧死了学生”，使一些不明真相的学生情绪激动。4月20日凌晨，我公安干警将冲击、围堵新华门的学生强行带离现场，用公共汽车送到北京大学，又有人造出了所谓“4·20血案”的谣言，说什么“警察在新华门打人，不光打学生，还打了工人、女人和小孩”，“一千多名科技工作者倒在血泊中”，搞得一些人的情绪更加激愤。4月22日，胡耀邦同志追悼大会结束，李鹏等中央领导同志离开人民大会堂之后，有的人为了制造攻击李鹏同志的口实，又精心策划了一场骗局。他们先是造谣说，“李鹏总理答应12点45分出来接见广场上的同学”，接着就由3名学生在人民大会堂东门外台阶上跪递“请愿书”，然后又宣称“李鹏临时变卦，拒不接见，欺骗学生”，煽动起广场上数万学生的强烈不满，几乎造成冲击人民大会堂的严重事件。由于这些谣言的蛊惑和挑唆，大大激化了青年学生同政府的对立情绪。极少数人就利用这种情绪，提出了“和平请愿，政府不理，通电全国，统一罢课”的口号，造成北京6万高校学生罢课的严重局面，许多外地高校也相继罢课，使学潮升级，动乱扩大。
    这场动乱还有一个特点，就是它已经不局限于高等学校，也不局限于北京地区，而是向着全社会和全国各地扩散。胡耀邦同志追悼会结束后，一些人到中学、工厂、商店、农村串联，上街演讲，散发传单，贴标语，搞募捐，千方百计扩大事态。有的中学出现了“反对中国共产党”的标语，有的中学出现了“罢课罢考万岁”的大字报，有的工厂贴出了“联合工农，打倒暴政”的传单。动乱的组织者和策划者还提出了“南下北上，东来西走”的口号，企图发动全国性的大串联。南京、武汉、西安、长沙、上海、哈尔滨等地的高校都发现从北京去的学生，天津、河北、安徽、浙江等地的学生也到北京参加游行。在长沙、西安等地，发生了严重打、砸、抢、烧的违法犯罪活动。
    这场动乱一开始就有海外、国外各种政治势力插手。国民党豢养的反动组织“中国民主联盟”成员胡平、陈军、刘晓波等人，联名从美国纽约发出了《致中国大学生公开信》，要参加学潮的学生注意“巩固在这次活动中建立起来的组织联系，力求以一个坚强的群体进行有效的活动”，“应把彻底否定1987年反自由化运动作为突破口”，“加强与各种新闻媒介的联系”，“加强与社会其他各界的联系”，“在运动中争取他们的支持和参与”。“中国民主联盟”的两个头头王炳章和汤光中还急急忙忙从纽约飞往东京，企图闯回北京，直接插手这场动乱。一些主张在中国实行西方资本主义制度的海外华人知识分子，特邀方励之领衔，从哥伦比亚大学发回了《敦促中国大陆民主政治宣言》，鼓吹“人民必须拥有对执政党的选择权”，煽动人们推翻共产党。一个化名“红岩”的人从美国用传真电话发回“修改宪法的十条意见”，提出全国和各级人大代表以及各级法院的法官，都应“由无党派候选人中选举产生”，企图把共产党从国家权力机关和司法机关中彻底排除出去。一批身居美国的原“中国之春”成员，匆匆忙忙地组成了“中国民主党”，向北京一些大学发出了《告全国同胞书》，煽动学生“要求保守派的官僚们下台”，“促使中共结束其专制统治”。港台、美国和西方国家的一些反动政治势力，也通过各种渠道，采用各种手段，纷纷介入。一些西方通讯社表现了异乎寻常的热心，特别是“美国之音”，每天用三种节目，花十多个小时，向中国大陆进行喋喋不休的报道，造谣惑众，煽风点火，为这场动乱推波助澜。
    以上大量事实说明，出现在我们面前的已经不是一般意义的学潮，而是抱有明确的政治目的，背离了民主和法制的轨道，运用卑劣的政治手段，煽动大批不明真相的群众和学生，有计划、有组织、有预谋地挑起的一场否定共产党的领导、否定社会主义制度的政治动乱。如果不是这样从本质上分析问题和认识问题，我们就会犯极大的错误，就会在斗争中陷于极大的被动。
    三、《人民日报》“四·二六”社论对动乱的定性是正确的
    从4月15日胡耀邦同志逝世到4月22日治丧结束，赵紫阳同志对悼念活动期间出现的日益明显的动乱迹象一直采取容忍和放纵的态度，助长了动乱的形成和发展。面对日益严峻的形势，中央和北京市许多同志都感到事情的性质已经发生变化，多次向赵紫阳同志提出，中央应有明确的方针和对策，以便迅速制止事态的发展，但他始终回避对事情的性质进行认真的分析和讨论。胡耀邦同志追悼会结束后，中央的同志再次建议在他4月23日出访朝鲜前开一次会，但他不仅拒不接受，反而若无其事地打高尔夫球去了。由于他采取这样的态度，使党和政府丧失了制止动乱的时机。
    4月24日下午，北京市委、市人民政府向万里同志作了汇报。在万里同志的建议下，当天晚上由李鹏同志主持，政治局常委对事态的发展进行了认真的分析研究。会议一致认为，当时的种种事态表明，在极少数人的操纵和策动下，一场有计划、有组织的反党、反社会主义的政治斗争已经摆在我们面前。会议决定在中央成立制止动乱小组，同时要求北京市委和市人民政府放手发动群众，争取多数，孤立少数，力争尽快平息动乱，稳定局势。次日上午，邓小平同志发表重要讲话，对中央常委的决定表示完全赞同和支持，对动乱的性质作了深刻分析。他一针见血地指出，这不是一般的学潮，而是一场否定共产党的领导、否定社会主义制度的政治动乱。邓小平同志的讲话，大大地提高了广大干部的认识，增强了大家平息动乱、稳定大局的信心和勇气。《人民日报》4月26日的社论，体现了政治局常委的决定和邓小平同志的讲话精神，指明了动乱的性质。同时，明确地把极少数动乱组织者和策划者同广大青年学生区别了开来。社论的发表，使绝大多数干部感到心里有了底，行动有了方向，可以旗帜鲜明地开展工作了。
    《人民日报》社论发表之后，在中共中央、国务院的直接领导下，中共北京市委和市人民政府接连召开党内外各种会议，坚持原则，统一认识；运用各种形式澄清谣言，安定人心；支持学校领导、党团员和学生骨干大胆工作，对参加游行示威的学生进行劝阻和疏导；积极开展各种对话活动，努力争取群众。国务院发言人袁木等同志同学生的对话，中央有关部门负责人同学生的对话，中共北京市委、市人民政府主要领导同志同学生的对话，都取得了良好的效果。同时，认真做好工厂、农村、商店、中小学和街道的工作，稳住大局，防止动乱向社会蔓延。各省、市、自治区也按照社论精神，抓紧做好本地区的工作，防止北京事态的影响向外地扩散。
    由于4月26日社论旗帜鲜明，使动乱的组织者和策划者被迫在策略上来了一百八十度的大转弯。社论发表前，大量的标语、口号是反对共产党、反对社会主义、反对四项基本原则的；社论发表后，4月26日，非法组织北京“高自联”就发出了改变策略的“新学联一号令”，要求4月27日“在拥护共产党的旗帜下游行到天安门”，规定的口号包括“拥护共产党”、“拥护社会主义”、“维护宪法”等，并且在方励之的授意下，把“打倒官僚政府”、“打倒腐败政府”、“打倒独裁统治”等颠覆性的口号改成了“反官僚、反腐败、反特权”等各界群众赞同的口号。日本时事社这时从北京发出一则题为《年轻官员结成支持民主化集团》的报道，把所谓“赵紫阳智囊团”里的一些人物称之为“中共中央和政府的年轻官员”，说他们“频繁地接触北大、清华、人大、北师大等参加游行的北京市内的各大学的新自治会代表，给学生们出主意”，在27日的大游行中，学生们举着“‘拥护社会主义’、‘拥护共产党的领导’等标语，这也是遵照了这个集团的指示”。学潮的头头们原来打算要“百日游行，无限期罢课”，社论发表后，这个劲头没有了。5月4日同4月27日的游行相比，学生人数由3万多人减少到不足2万人，围观的群众也大为减少。“五四”游行之后，经过各高校党政领导做工作，80％的学生都复了课。全国各地在《人民日报》“4·26”社论发表后，局势也迅速趋向平稳。显然，再做一些工作，这场由极少数人利用学潮引起的动乱就有可能得到平息。大量事实说明，《人民日报》4月26日社论是正确的，它的确起到了稳定首都、安定全国的作用。
    四、赵紫阳同志“五四”讲话是动乱升级的转折点
    在动乱接近平息的时候，作为中国共产党总书记的赵紫阳同志，却采取了出尔反尔、反复无常的态度。本来，在他出访朝鲜期间，政治局常委征求他的意见时，他就打回电报，明确表示“完全同意小平同志就对付当前动乱问题所作出的决策”。4月30日回国之后，他在政治局常委会议上还再次表示，同意小平同志的讲话和4月26日社论对动乱的定性，认为前段对学潮的处理是好的。但是，没过几天，他却在5月4日下午接见亚洲银行年会代表时，发表了一通同政治局常委决定、邓小平同志讲话和社论精神完全对立的意见。第一，在已经出现明显动乱的情况下，他却说“中国不会出现大的动乱”；第二，在大量事实已经证明动乱的实质是否定共产党领导、否定社会主义制度的情况下，他还坚持说“他们绝对不是要反对我们的根本制度，而是要求我们把工作中的弊病改掉”；第三，在已经有种种事实说明极少数人利用学潮策动动乱的情况下，他还只是说“难免”“有人企图利用”，从根本上否定了中央关于极少数人已经在制造动乱的正确判断。赵紫阳同志的这番讲话，是鲍彤事先为他起草好的。鲍彤还要求中央人民广播电台和电视台当天下午就立即广播，并且要连播3天；又要求《人民日报》次日在头版显著地位发表，同时要大量刊登各方面的正面反映。而对不同的意见不仅扣住不发，甚至不许在内部参考读物上发表。赵紫阳同志的这番讲话，经过《人民日报》及某些报纸的大肆渲染，在广大干部、群众中造成了严重的思想混乱，给动乱的组织者和策划者撑了腰，壮了胆，打了气。
    赵紫阳同志的讲话同中央的方针截然不同，这一点不仅在国内引起广泛议论，连国外的舆论都看得清清楚楚。路透社在一篇报道中说，赵的讲话“与一周前对学生们的严厉谴责形成了鲜明对照”，是对“上周的判断的一大修改”。法国《世界报》5月6日也载文指出，“这位党的首脑（指赵紫阳）似乎已出色地使形势的发展变得对他有利了”。这篇讲话抛出之后，各级领导干部、党团员和群众中的骨干，尤其是高校的同志，思想上感到迷惑不解，工作上感到无所适从，许多人都表示反对。有的人说：“中央出了两个声音，谁对谁错，以谁为准？”有的说：
    “要我们同中央保持一致，同哪个中央保持一致？”有的说：“紫阳在上边当好人，我们在下边当恶人。”学校干部和学生骨干普遍认为“被出卖了”，心情十分沉重，有的伤心得流下了眼泪，学校工作完全陷于被动。当时，北京市委、市人民政府的处境非常困难，明知道中央的意见不一致，对下还要违心地说是一致的，只不过是“侧重点不同”。许多事情需要向中央请示，而作为总书记的赵紫阳同志却迟迟不召开会议。在北京市委、市人民政府的强烈要求下，5月8日勉强开了一次会，但根本不听北京市的汇报。会上有的同志反映，赵紫阳同志5月4日的谈话与4月26日的社论精神不一致，他声色俱厉地说：
  “我讲错了我负责任。”在另一次会上，有的同志反映，第一线工作的同志都说“被出卖了”，赵紫阳同志生气地责问：“谁把你们出卖了？只有文化大革命才有人被出卖。”当时，上上下下有不少人同港台报纸相呼应，一而再再而三地攻击北京市委、市人民政府等在第一线工作的同志，连游行的痞子也高呼口号：
  “北京市委，谎报军情，欺骗中央，罪责难逃。”大家眼看着事态越来越恶化，有些措施想办也办不了。
    同上述情况相反，动乱的组织者和策划者却从赵紫阳同志的谈话中受到了鼓舞。严家其、曹思源（四通公司发展研究所所长）等人说：“现在出现了转机，要发动知识界支持赵紫阳。”张显扬说：“不是说要利用学生吗，赵紫阳现在就是要利用一下了。”在赵紫阳同志的鼓动和少数人的策划下，北京大学和师范大学“自治会”的头头当晚就重新宣布罢课，许多学校也相继宣布继续罢课，并且组织了“纠察队”，禁止愿意复课的学生去教室上课。接着，游行示威的浪潮又重新掀起。5月9日，30多家新闻单位的数百名新闻工作者上街游行，递交请愿书。北京大学、清华大学、人民大学、师范大学、政法大学等十多所高校的上万名学生又上了街，示威游行，声援记者，散发传单，鼓动罢课绝食。从此，事态骤然逆转，动乱重新走向高潮。在北京的影响下，外地已经平稳下来的局势又重新紧张起来。赵紫阳同志讲话之后不久，5月9日、10日，山西太原就发生了大批游行示威的学生冲击省委、省政府，冲击当时正在举行的国际经济技术合作洽谈会、进出口商品交易会和民间艺术节的事件，在国内和国际上都造成了非常恶劣的影响。
    五、以绝食相要挟，使动乱更加扩大
    善良的人们提出，学生闹得这么凶，是不是政府对他们理解不够，体谅不够，让步不够？事实完全不是这样。从动乱一开始，党和政府就充分肯定了广大青年学生的爱国热情和忧国忧民之心，充分肯定了广大青年学生提出的促进民主、深化改革、惩治官倒、消除腐败的要求同党和政府的愿望是一致的，并且希望通过民主和法制的正常程序解决问题。但是，这种良好的愿望并没有得到积极的响应。政府提出，希望通过多渠道、多层次、多种形式的对话，来沟通思想，增进理解，而非法学生组织却对对话条件提出了很高的价码。他们要求，对话的对象“必须是中央政治局常委、人大副委员长和国务院副总理以上的人员”，每次对话“必须出具联合公告，由双方共同签字”，对话要由“政府和学生代表分别指定地点轮流举行”。这哪里是什么对话，完全是摆出一副要同党和政府进行政治谈判的架势。特别是赵紫阳同志的“五四”讲话以后，极少数人更是利用这一时机，把党和政府的克制视为软弱可欺，要价更高，条件更苛刻，使动乱不断加温，步步升级。即便在这样的情况下，党和政府仍然采取了十分容忍和克制的态度，希望继续保持对话的渠道，以利于教育群众和争取多数。5月13日凌晨2时，“高自联”的头头提出了对话的要求，凌晨4时，中共中央办公厅和国务院办公厅就答复同意，但天明之后，他们又自食其言，取消了这次对话。5月13日上午，中共中央办公厅、国务院办公厅和全国人大常委会办公厅的信访局再次通知他们，决定于15日同学生进行对话。他们一方面表示同意，一方面又在参加人数上大作文章，先是提出了一个20人的名单，政府同意后，又要求增至200人，还没有等到充分商量，就指责“政府对话毫无诚意”，在接到对话通知仅4小时之后，就急急忙忙抛出早已准备好的《绝食宣言》，发动了一场历时7天、前后有3000多人参加的大绝食，从此长期占据了天安门广场。“高自联”的头头王丹说，选在13日开始绝食，“正好可以借戈尔巴乔夫访华压他们”。极少数动乱的组织者和策划者把绝食学生当“人质”，以他们的生命为赌注，采取极其恶劣的手段要挟政府，使动乱更加严重。
    在学生绝食过程中，党和政府继续保持了极其克制的态度，竭尽全力，在各方面做了力所能及的工作。首先是学校工作人员、各级领导干部直到党和国家领导人，多次到天安门广场看望绝食学生，对他们进行思想疏导。其次是协助红十字会，先后调配了100多辆救护车，抽调了数百名医护人员，昼夜守护在绝食现场，并动员52家医院腾出近2000张病床，保证因绝食休克或致病的学生及时得到救护和治疗。三是提供各种物资，尽可能减少绝食学生的痛苦和保障他们的安全。北京市委、市人民政府抽调干部、工人和车辆，通过红十字会，昼夜为绝食学生运送饮水，提供食盐和食糖；环卫局调出了洒水车，配备了脸盆、毛巾，供绝食学生洗漱；医药公司调来充足的防中暑、防感冒、防腹泻药剂，交由红十字会分发；食品部门运来大量饮料、面包等，以备紧急抢救学生时使用；商业部门调运了6000顶草帽，北京军区应北京市要求送来1000条棉被，供绝食学生白天避暑，晚上御寒；为保持绝食现场的卫生，搭起了临时冲洗厕所，环卫工人还趁深夜进行了绝食现场的大清扫；18日大雨前，又从公共交通总公司抽调78辆大客车，从物资局调来400多块厚木板，供绝食学生避雨、隔潮。在长达7天的绝食期间，没有发生一起学生因绝食而死亡的事件。但是，所有这些，都没有得到任何积极的反响。事实一再教育人们，极少数动乱的组织者和策划者是执意同我们作对到底的，容忍一千遍，退让一万步，也是解决不了问题的。
    这里需要特别指出的是，在事态急剧恶化的情况下，赵紫阳同志不仅没有做他应当做的工作，反而煽动新闻界，进行错误的舆论导向，把已经恶化的局面搞得更加难以收拾。5月6日，赵紫阳同志对当时中央主管宣传和思想工作的胡启立、芮杏文同志说，对学潮的报道“放开了一点，游行作了报道，新闻公开程度增加一点，风险不大”。甚至还说：“面对国内人心所向，面对国际进步潮流，我们只能因势利导”。在这里，他竟把反共反社会主义的逆流称之为“国内人心所向”和“国际进步潮流”。他的这番指示，当天就向首都主要新闻单位作了传达，随后又作了多次部署。这样，《人民日报》等许多中央报刊便对游行、静坐、绝食等采取了充分肯定、积极支持的态度，进行了连篇累牍甚至言过其实的报道，连香港报纸也对这种奇特的现象表示惊讶。
    在舆论的错误引导下，从5月15日开始，上街游行声援学生的群众一天比一天多，声势一天比一天大，从几万人、十几万人发展到几十万人，全国各地还有20多万学生赶来声援。一时间，似乎不参加游行就是“不爱国”，不表示声援就是“不关心学生的死活”。在这种情况下，绝食的学生骑虎难下，欲罢不能。许多教师和学生家长给领导机关和新闻单位写信、打电话，要求报社、电台、电视台不要把绝食的学生逼上死路，要求发发善心，救救孩子，停止这种“杀人舆论”，但没有得到什么效果。由于学生绝食和市民游行，首都北京的社会秩序陷于一片混乱，举世瞩目的中苏高级会晤受到严重干扰，一些活动日程被变更，有的被取消。与此同时，全国各大城市乃至所有省会城市游行的人数急剧增加，一些中小城市也出现了游行，波及面如此之广，骚扰如此之严重，是建国以来没有过的。
    为了给学生撑腰打气，给动乱火上浇油，一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的所谓“精英”，纷纷赤膊上阵，走上前台。5月13日晚，严家其、苏绍智、包遵信等人在北京大学贴出《我们再也不能沉默了》的大字报，动员知识分子参加他们发起的声援学生绝食的大游行。5月14日，严家其、包遵信、李洪林、戴晴（《光明日报》记者）、于浩成（原群众出版社社长）、李泽厚（中国社会科学院哲学所研究员）、苏晓康（北京广播学院讲师）、温元凯（中国科技大学教授）、刘再复（中国社会科学院文学所所长）等12人又发出《我们对今天局势的紧急呼吁》，要求宣布这次动乱是“爱国民主运动”，要求宣布非法的学生组织为合法，说如果不能实现要求，他们也将参加绝食。这个呼吁，在《光明日报》公开发表，在中央电视台公开播出。这些人还多次到天安门广场，发表演说，进行煽动，诬蔑我们的政府是“无能的政府”，说什么由学生绝食“看到了中国的光辉前程”。接着，又组成了非法的“首都知识界联合会”，发表了《5·16声明》，倒打一耙地威胁说，政府如果不接受极少数人的政治要求，“将极可能把一个很有希望的中国引向真正动乱的深渊”。
    在事态一天比一天严重的情况下，赵紫阳同志利用5月16日会见戈尔巴乔夫的机会，有意识地把斗争矛头引向邓小平同志，更使局势进一步恶化。他在会见时，一开头就说：“在最重要的问题上，仍然需要邓小平同志掌舵。十三大以来，我们在处理最重大的问题时，总是向邓小平同志通报，向他请教。”他还说，这是他“第一次”公开透露了中国党的这个“决定”。第二天，严家其、包遵信等人就发表了极其猖狂恶毒的《5·17宣言》。他们咒骂说：“由于独裁者掌握了无限权力，政府丧失了自己的责任，丧失了人性”，“清王朝已经死亡76年了，但是，中国还有一位没有皇帝头衔的皇帝，一位年迈昏庸的独裁者”。他们毫无掩饰地说，“昨天下午，赵紫阳总书记公开宣布，中国的一切决策，都必须经过这位老朽的独裁者”。他们声嘶力竭地叫嚷：“老人政治必须结束！独裁者必须辞职！”对于这种极其反动的叫嚣，港台的一些报刊也遥相呼应。香港的《快报》于5月18日发表《倒邓倒李不倒赵》的文章，说什么“赵紫阳的讲话充满暗示，现时国内的乌烟瘴气，全因邓小平掌舵而起”，“现今群情汹涌要倒邓倒李，而赵紫阳所扮演的角色，可以说是呼之欲出了”。还说，“倘若倒邓成功，而中国的改革确能走上开明法治之途和实现民主，对香港来说，是一则喜讯”。在这一派呼啸声中，咒骂邓小平同志、攻击李鹏同志的标语、口号铺天盖地，有的要求“邓小平滚下台”，有的提出“李鹏下台，谢国安民”。在这同时，“拥护赵紫阳”、“赵紫阳万岁”、“赵紫阳荣升军委主席”等标语口号充斥于游行队伍和天安门广场。动乱策划者们企图借混乱之机，乱中夺权。他们散发传单，宣称成立“北京市各界人民代表会议筹委会”，要取代市人民代表大会，并鼓吹成立“北京区政府”，取代合法的北京市人民政府。他们攻击依法选举产生的国务院是“伪政府”，造谣说已有外交部等十几个部“宣布独立”，脱离国务院，世界上已有30多个国家同我国断交。他们还造谣说，“邓小平已下台”，于是就有人抬着棺材游行，烧毁邓小平同志的模拟像，在天安门广场燃放鞭炮庆祝他们的“胜利”。
    首都的局势越来越严重，无政府主义恶性泛滥，许多地方已陷入一片混乱和白色恐怖之中。在这种情况下，我们的党和政府如果还不采取坚决果断的措施，那么，就会再度严重贻误时机，进一步造成不可挽回的巨大损失，这是广大人民群众绝对不会允许的。
    六、北京部分地区实行戒严是不得已而采取的正确措施为了保证北京市的社会安宁，保障公民的生命财产安全，保障中央国家机关和北京市政府正常执行公务，在北京市警力严重不足，已无法维持正常的生产、工作和生活秩序的情况下，根据《中华人民共和国宪法》第89条第16项授予的权力，国务院决定在北京部分地区实行戒严。这是不得已而采取的措施，也是果断的、正确的决策。
    5月19日，中央召开首都党政军机关干部大会，宣布了进一步采取果断措施制止动乱的决策。赵紫阳同志顽固坚持同中央正确决策相对立的错误立场，既不同意和李鹏同志一道在大会上发表讲话，也不同意主持大会，甚至连出席一下大会都不同意，把他同党闹分裂的态度公开暴露于全党全国和全世界面前。
    在这之前，5月17日中央政治局常委讨论了在北京部分地区实行戒严的问题，极少数掌握党和国家核心机密的人，出于反革命的政治需要，当天就泄漏了戒严的机密。一名在赵紫阳同志身边工作的人对非法学生组织的头头说，现在军队要“镇压”你们，别人都同意，就是赵紫阳反对，你们要做好准备。17日晚，鲍彤召集中央政治体制改革研究室的部分人员，在泄露了即将戒严的机密之后，发表了“告别演说”，警告与会者不得把会上密谋策划的情况透露给别人，否则就是“叛徒”，就是“犹大”。5月19日，就是这个政治体制改革研究室的副局长高山，赶到经济体制改革研究所，向正在开会的人传达了所谓“上边”的指示。随后由陈一谘（经济体制改革研究所所长）主持，用经济体制改革研究所、国务院农研中心发展研究所、中信公司国际问题研究所、北京青年经济学会等4家的名义，起草了《关于时局的6点声明》，在天安门广场进行了广播，并广为散发。《声明》要求，“公开高层领导的决策内幕和分歧”，要求“召开全国人民代表大会特别会议”，“召开中国共产党特别代表大会”，并且授意天安门广场上的学生“要尽快结束绝食”，暗示政府将“采取极端举动（军管）”。接着，自称来自“体改委”的一些人窜到天安门广场，发表演讲，说什么“怀着极为悲痛极为愤慨的心情，公布一个绝对真实的消息，赵紫阳总书记已经被罢免”，呼吁全国罢工、罢课、罢市，煽动群众“立即行动起来，进行决死的斗争”。这个演讲，很快就被印成《人民日报号外》广为散发。当晚，在北京站广场等公共场所还发现题为《关于学运策略的几点建议》的传单，指示“目前绝食对话已不是我们的手段和要求，应当改为和平静坐，并旗帜鲜明地提出新的政治要求和口号，即：（一）紫阳同志不能走；（二）立即召开中国共产党全国代表大会特别会议；（三）立即召开全国人民代表大会特别会议”，还说“对军队的到来不应采取惶惶不安、如惊弓之鸟的态度”，“这种对待军队的态度及方式，要在他们到来之前反复向同学们解释宣传”。最近一些已经被逮捕归案的“高自联”和“工自联”的头头也交待，5月19日下午4时许，有人自称中央某机关工作人员，拿着条子到“天安门广场指挥部”，透露了即将实行戒严的消息。正是极少数掌握党和国家核心机密的人同动乱的组织者和策划者紧密结合，使他们得以及时调整策略，在当天晚上抢在中央召开首都党政军干部大会之前45分钟宣布把绝食变成静坐，造成既然学生已经停止绝食政府就没有必要戒严的假象，以迷惑群众；得以及时组织力量，裹胁不明真相的人，在各主要路口设置路障，堵截军车；得以继续组织舆论，混淆视听，扰乱人心。他们一面恶毒咒骂邓小平同志等老一辈无产阶级革命家，说什么“我们不要邓小平的智慧和经验”，一方面大肆吹捧赵紫阳同志，说什么“党无紫阳，国无指望”，呼唤“还我紫阳”。他们还阴谋集结力量，搞更大的动乱，宣称要动员20万人占领天安门，要在5月20日组织全市性的总罢工，并且同19日赵紫阳同志称病请假3天相配合，扬言3天之后就要成立“新政府”。
    在极端紧急的情况下，中共中央、国务院断然决定于20日上午10时起在首都部分地区实行戒严，以防止事态更加恶化，掌握制止动乱的主动权，给广大反对动乱、渴求安定的人民群众撑腰。但是，由于我们的决策事先被动乱的组织者和策划者所掌握，部队进城仍然遇到了巨大的困难和阻挠。戒严的前夕和戒严后的头两天，所有的主要交通路口都被堵塞，220多辆公共汽车被劫持，当作路障，交通陷于瘫痪，各路戒严部队不能及时按计划进入指定地点。中共中央、国务院的驻地继续被围堵，街头煽动的演讲随处可见，制造谣言的传单比比皆是，数万人的游行示威接连不断，首都北京处于一片混乱和恐怖之中。随后几天，戒严部队采取不同的方式陆续进入城内，广大武警、公安干警排除万难坚持执勤，各城区和近郊区把工人、市民、机关干部组织起来，建立了约12万人的首都群众维持秩序工作队，各远郊县也出动了民兵，依靠军、警、民的协同努力，使首都交通运输和生产、生活秩序逐步有所好转，人心逐渐趋于安定。但是，极少数人制造动乱的活动一天也没有停止，推翻共产党领导的目标丝毫也没有改变，事态正在一天一天地向着反革命暴乱的方向发展。
    戒严之后，动乱的组织者和策划者的一个重要策略，就是继续占据天安门广场不走。他们要把广场作为所谓“学运乃至全民族的一个中枢”，一旦政府做出什么决定，就准备在广场上“作出强烈的反应”，“组成一个反政府的统一战线”。他们早就策划在广场挑起流血事件，认为“只要不撤离广场，政府就会进行镇压”，“鲜血可以促使人民觉醒，使政府分化瓦解”。为了支撑广场的局面，他们依靠海内外反动势力提供的资金，不断改善设施，装备先进的通讯工具，每日耗资10万余元，而且开始非法采购武器。他们依靠香港声援团提供的帐篷，在广场建立了所谓“自由村”，开办了所谓“民主大学”，声称要使它成为“新时代的黄埔军校”。他们还在人民英雄纪念碑前树立了一个什么女神像，原来叫“自由女神”，后来又改名为“民主之神”，把美国的民主、自由作为他们的精神支柱。刘晓波等幕后策划者担心静坐请愿的学生难以坚持，就亲自走到前台，搞了一个4人参加的48小时至72小时的绝食闹剧，为青年学生加油打气。他们说：“只要广场的旗子不倒，就可以坚持斗争，辐射全国，直到政府垮台。”
    动乱的组织者和策划者，利用政府和部队在戒严之后仍然采取的克制态度，继续组织各种非法活动。他们继“高自联”、“工自联”、“绝食团”、“天安门广场指挥部”、“首都知识界联合会”等非法组织之后，又相继建立了“首都各界爱国维宪联席会”、“北京市民自治联合会”等非法组织。他们用经济体制改革研究所、国务院农研中心发展研究所、北京青年经济学会的名义，明目张胆地打电报给一些部队，挑拨离间，进行策反。他们组织专门的舆论班子，筹办地下报纸，从事颠覆政府的地下活动。他们结成死党，集体进行地下宣誓，声称“绝不出卖自己的良知，绝不向专制屈服，绝不向八十年代中国的皇帝称臣”。四通公司总经理万润南在国际饭店召集“高自联”的部分头头开会，提出了退出天安门广场的6个条件，即“军队回去，戒严取消，李鹏下台，邓小平、杨尚昆退休，赵紫阳复出”，并且准备组织所谓“凯旋在子夜的大进军”。特别严重的是，他们认为赵紫阳同志请病假离开总书记的岗位之后，从党内解决问题的希望已经渺茫，转而寄希望于召开全国人大常委会的紧急会议。严家其、包遵信等致电人大常委会领导人，说什么“目前宪法受到少数人的粗暴践踏，我们紧急建议，立即召开全国人大常委会紧急会议，解决当前面临的严重问题”。在某位人大常委委员的支持和授意下，四通社会发展研究所发出《提议立即召开全国人大常委紧急会议》的征询意见函，征集了部分人大常委的签名，并且向外地部分人大常委发了加急电报。他们采取阴谋手段，向一些人大常委发函、发电时，只讲建议开会，而不讲他们真正的主张，企图欺骗一些不明真相的同志，甚至盗用他们的名义，强加于人，以售其奸。在办了这些事情之后，严家其、包遵信就在香港的《明报》上，发表了《在民主与法制的轨道上解决当前中国的问题——兼告李鹏书》，呼吁“每一位全国人大常委会委员，每一位全国人大代表，投下神圣的一票，废除戒严令，罢免李鹏总理职务”。
    动乱的组织者和策划者还肆无忌惮地挑动和组织暴力行动。他们纠集本地的流氓地痞、外地的流窜犯以及未改造好的刑满释放分子，网罗对共产党和社会主义制度刻骨仇恨的人，拼凑所谓“敢死队”、“飞虎队”、“义勇军”等恐怖组织，扬言要软禁、绑架党和国家领导人，要用“攻打巴士底狱”的方式夺取政权。他们散发煽动反革命武装暴乱的传单，鼓吹“星星之火可以燎原”，号召组织“可能被称为人民军的武装力量”，“团结包括台湾国民党在内的各种力量”，“不惜抛头颅洒热血，旗帜鲜明地反对共产党和它的政府”。他们扬言，“秋后算账，非算不可”，要算党的账，算政府的账，并且准备了要镇压的干部名单。香港《明报》还刊登了动乱组织者和策划者之一的刘晓波6月2日同一个所谓“大陆民运领袖”的“对谈”，公然叫嚷“期望赵紫阳复出，我们就必须在人民中组织武装部队”。
    动乱策动者的种种活动，都有雄厚的财力作后盾。除四通公司等单位给予几十万元的物质支援外，还得到海外敌对势力和一些组织与个人的财力物力支援。美国、英国和香港的一些人，给了上百万美元和数千万港币。这笔钱中的一部分，被用于破坏戒严活动，每一个参加设路障、堵军车的人，每天都可以得到30元的报酬。同时，他们还许下高价，收买暴徒，去烧军车和打解放军，许诺烧一辆军车给3000元，抓住或打死一个军人也给几千元。台湾一位军政要员发起了“送爱心到天安门”的运动，带头捐款10万元台币。国民党一个中委发起募捐1亿元台币，设立所谓“支援大陆民主运动基金”。台湾艺术文化界一些人发起“血脉相连声援大陆民主运动”。北京“高自联”致函“台湾艺文界朋友”，说什么“在此关键时刻，得悉台湾艺文界挺身而出”，“给予我们急需的物资和精神支持，我们对此表示由衷的感谢和敬意”。
    所有这些说明，极少数人有计划、有组织、有预谋制造的动乱，绝不像善良的人们想象的那样，只要政府做点让步就可以平息，或者只发布一个戒严令就可以解决问题。他们是横下一条心，要和海外、国外敌对势力联合起来，同我们死战到底的。一切一厢情愿的善良愿望，只会使他们更加放肆地向我们发动进攻。时间拖得越久，付出的代价越大。
    七、极少数人是怎样挑起反革命暴乱的
    中国人民解放军不仅担负着“巩固国防，抵抗侵略，保卫祖国”的神圣职责，而且担负着“保卫人民的和平劳动，参加国家建设事业，努力为人民服务”的崇高义务，这是《宪法》第29条明文规定了的。部队进城维护社会治安，正是执行《宪法》赋予的任务。
    5月20日宣布在首都部分地区实行戒严之后，尽管遇到重重阻拦，部队仍然按照既定计划，采取不同的方式，陆续进入城内，到达一部分警戒部位。极少数暴乱的组织者和策划者深知，如果执行戒严任务的部队全部按计划到位，那么，他们正在从事的种种非法活动和反革命活动就无法再进行下去，他们的全部阴谋就将很快以失败而告终。于是，他们窥测时机，蓄意挑起事端，竭力使动乱加剧，最终发展成为一场反革命暴乱。6月1日，我公安机关收审了非法组织“工自联”的几个头头，他们就借机煽动一些人，包围和冲击了北京市公安局、市委、市政府机关和公安部。6月2日晚，中央电视台借用了10个月的武警部队的一辆吉普车，在返回原单位途中，由于车速过快，路面有水打滑，造成翻车事故，撞死了人，但没有一个是学生。这本来是一起交通事故，有关部门正在处理，而极少数人却有意把它同戒严部队按计划进城的行动联系起来，大造谣言，说是戒严部队的开道车故意轧死学生，鼓动不明真相的人，要抢夺尸体，举行抬棺大游行。一时间，人心浮动，气氛紧张。经过这样的煽动和鼓噪，暴乱的火就被他们点了起来。
    6月3日凌晨，当部分戒严部队按计划进入警戒目标的过程中，就有人有组织地煽动一些人在建国门、南河沿、西单、木樨地等路口阻拦大小车辆，设置路障，拦截军车、殴打战士，抢夺军用物资。曹各庄附近12辆军车被拦。从燕京饭店门前经过的战士被强行搜身。电报大楼前的军车轮胎被扎穿，并被隔离墩围住。
    拂晓前后，永定门桥头的军车被推翻。木樨地军车车胎被扎穿。朝阳门的400多名进城战士被歹徒用石块乱砸。六部口、横二条一带军车被拦截，战士被围困。
    早上7时左右，在六部口，有的歹徒钻进被围困的军车内，抢夺装有子弹的机枪。从建国门到东单，以及天桥附近，进城部队被零星隔断，遭到围攻、殴打。在建国门立交桥上，有些战士的衣服被扒光，有的战士被打得遍体鳞伤。
    上午，虎坊桥一带的进城部队被冲，战士遭痛打，有的被打瞎了眼睛。一些被打伤的战士在送往医院途中遭拦截，急救车车胎被放气，伤员被绑架。虎坊路至陶然亭21辆军车被围，在战士转移弹药时，前往护卫的民警被打伤。
    中午，被拦阻在府右街南口、正义路北口、宣武门、虎坊桥、木樨地、东四等路口的解放军战士，有的被打伤，有的钢盔、军帽、雨衣、水壶、挎包被抢。六部口一伙人截了一辆载有枪支弹药的军车，武警部队和公安干警多次解围均未成功。车上的枪支弹药如被抢走或发生爆炸，后果不堪设想。为了保护首都人民生命财产安全，在万不得已的情况下，武警部队施放了催泪弹，驱散了人群，抢回了弹药车。
    在拦截、砸抢军车的同时，一伙暴徒围堵和冲击国家机关和重要部门。他们冲人民大会堂、冲中宣部、冲广播电视部，冲中南海的西门和南门。保卫这些机关的武警战士和公安干警数十人负伤。
    随着事态的急剧恶化，暴乱的挑动者更加猖狂。下午5时许，非法组织“高自联”和“工自联”的头头，在天安门广场分发了菜刀、匕首、铁棍、铁链子和带尖的竹竿，声言“抓住军警就要往死里打”。“工自联”在广播中大肆叫嚣，要“拿起武器推翻政府”。还有一伙暴徒纠集了上千人，推倒西单附近一个建筑工地的围墙，抢走大批施工工具和钢筋、砖块等，准备打巷战。他们的广播站不断播放如何制造和使用燃烧瓶、如何堵烧军车之类的“知识”，进行教唆和挑动。他们策划利用第二天是星期天的时机，煽动更多的人上街，发动更大规模的打、砸、抢、烧，造成一个群众暴动的态势，一举推翻政府，夺取政权。
    正是在这万分紧急的关头，中共中央、国务院、中央军委不得不下定决心，命令驻守在首都周围的戒严部队，强行开进，平息反革命暴乱。
    八、反革命暴徒是怎样残害解放军的
    自戒严以来，陆续进城的戒严部队根据中央的指示，始终保持高度克制的态度，尽量避免发生冲突。6月3日暴乱发生后，在部队进城前，为了避免伤害群众，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部于晚6时半发出《紧急通告》，要求“全体市民要提高警惕，从现在起，请你们不要上街去，不要到天安门广场去。广大职工要坚守岗位，市民要留在家里，以保证你们的生命安全。”这个《通告》，通过电台、电视台和各种广播器，进行了反复广播。
    6月3日晚10时前后，奉命向城内开进的各路戒严部队先后进入市区。但在各主要路口，都受到严重阻拦。即便在这种情况下，部队仍然采取了极其克制的态度。而反革命暴徒怀着对解放军的刻骨仇恨，却利用这种克制，发动了骇人听闻的打、砸、抢、烧，杀。
    22点至23点，从翠微路、公主坟、木樨地到西单一线，有12辆军车被烧。有些人用卡车运来砖头，向战士猛砸。一些暴徒把无轨电车推到路口，放火焚烧，阻断了道路。有的消防车赶去灭火，也被砸烂、烧毁。
    23点前后，虎坊桥3辆军车被砸，1辆吉普车被推翻。安定门立交桥军车被围堵。崇文门大街一个团的战士被围堵。建国门立交桥30辆军车被围堵。北京煤炭工业学校以西300多辆军车被围堵。为保证军车前进，有的战士和指挥员下车做疏导工作，被围攻殴打，有些被强行绑架，不知去向。被打伤的，有尉官、校官和将军。在南苑三营门受阻的军车，为避免冲突，往东绕行，至天坛南门再次被堵，许多军车被砸、被烧。珠市口一辆军车被堵后，一帮人爬到车上，下边有个干部模样的人劝他们下来，当即被痛打，生死不明。
    6月4日凌晨以后，焚烧军车的暴行愈演愈烈。在天坛东侧路、天坛北门、前门地铁西口、前门东路、府右街、六部口、西单、复兴门、南礼士路、木樨地、莲花池、车公庄、东华门、东直门，以及朝阳区的大北窑、呼家楼、北豆各庄，大兴县旧宫乡等地，数十个路口的数百辆军车，被暴徒用汽油、燃烧瓶和土制喷火器引燃，火光冲天，有的战士在车内被活活烧死，有的跳下车后被活活打死。有的地方，几辆、十几辆，甚至二三十辆军车同时被烧，一片火海。在双井路口，有70余辆装甲车被围，其中20余辆车上的机枪被暴徒拆掉。京原路口至老山骨灰堂以西，30多辆军车被暴徒付之一炬，现场浓烟冲天。有的暴徒手持铁棍，推着汽油桶，在路口堵截，见车就烧。多辆部队运粮车、被服车被暴徒枪劫，不知去向。有几名暴徒在复兴门立交桥一带，开着抢来的装甲车，边行进边开枪。非法组织“工自联”还在广播上宣称，他们缴获了一部军用电台和密码本。
    在砸毁、焚烧军车的同时，一些暴徒对民用设施和公共建筑物发动了攻击。西城区的燕山等商店的橱窗被砸。天安门前和毛主席纪念堂西侧的松树墙被点燃。一些公共电汽车、消防车、救护车、出租汽车被砸毁和烧毁。特别恶毒的是，一伙人驾驶一辆装满汽油的公共汽车驶向天安门城楼，企图放火烧毁城楼，在金水桥南被戒严部队及时截获。
    尤其不能令人容忍的是，暴徒们不仅疯狂攻击军车，大搞打砸抢烧，而且，对解放军战士发动了灭绝人性的残杀，手段极其凶暴野蛮。
    6月4日凌晨，东单路口一伙暴徒用酒瓶、砖头、自行车砸砍战士，许多战士血流满面。复兴门一辆军车被截，车上的某部管理科长、管理员、炊事员等12人被拉下车来，强行搜身，然后痛打，多人受重伤。六部口4名战士被围攻殴打，有的当场死亡。广渠门附近3名战士被痛打，只有一名被群众救出，两名下落不明。在西城区西兴盛胡同，有20余名武警战士被一伙歹徒毒打，有的被打成重伤，有的下落不明。护国寺一辆军车被截，战士被拉下来痛打后当作人质，一批冲锋枪被抢走。一辆装满砖头的汽车，由东交民巷开往天安门广场，车上的人高喊：“是中国人的上来，砸解放军去。”
    拂晓之后，残害解放军战士的暴行达到令人发指的地步。武警一支队的一辆救护车，拉了8名受伤的战士送往附近医院时，被一伙暴徒拦住，当场就打死一名，还叫嚷要把其余的7名一齐打死。在前门大街的一家自行车店门前，有3名解放军战士被打成重伤，暴徒们围住狂叫：“谁敢救他们就打死谁。”在长安街上，一辆军车熄火，一二百名暴徒一拥而上，猛砸驾驶室，将司机活活砸死。西单十字路口以东30米处，一名战士被打死，又在尸体上浇汽油焚烧，在阜成门，一名战士被暴徒残害后，尸体被悬挂在立交桥的栏杆上。在崇文门，一名战士被一伙暴徒从过街天桥上扔下，浇上汽油，活活烧死，暴徒们狂叫，这是“点天灯”。在西长安街首都电影院附近，一名解放军军官被暴徒打死后，剖腹挖眼，把尸体挂在一辆正在燃烧的公共汽车上。
    在几天的暴乱中，被暴徒砸毁、烧毁、损坏的军车、警车和公共电汽车等车辆达1280多辆，其中军用汽车1000多辆，装甲车60多辆，警车30多辆，公共电汽车120多辆，其它机动车70多辆。一批武器、弹药被抢。戒严部队战士、武警战士、公安干警负伤6000多人，死亡数十人。他们为保卫祖国，保卫宪法，保卫人民，付出了鲜血甚至宝贵的生命。对他们的功绩，人民将永远铭记。
    如此惨重的代价，最有力地说明了戒严部队所采取的极大的容忍和克制态度。人民解放军是中国共产党领导的全心全意为人民服务的军队。这支军队对敌人狠，对人民和，历来如此，他们在战争年代能够打败美帝国主义武装起来的国民党800万军队，打败武装到牙齿的美帝国主义，能够有效地保卫我们国家的神圣领土、领海和领空，为什么在平息反革命暴乱中却造成这么大的伤亡呢？为什么他们手中有武器，反而挨了打，甚至被打死呢？正如邓小平同志指出的，“是因为好人和坏人混杂在一起，使我们有些应该采取的断然措施难于出手”。这也正说明了人民解放军是热爱人民的，是不愿意误伤群众的。他们忍辱负重，从容赴死，正是人民军队本质的充分体现。否则，怎么可能造成这么大的伤亡和损失呢？这不正说明我们的军队为了保护人民而不惜牺牲自己吗？而最终为了平息反革命暴乱，避免造成更大的损失，戒严部队在伤亡严重、忍无可忍、让无可让而又很难前进的情况下，经过一再警告，迫不得已奉命对空鸣枪开道，进行反击，击毙了一些肆虐的暴徒。由于围观的人很多，有的被车撞、人挤，有的被流弹误伤，有的被持枪歹徒击伤击毙。据现在掌握的情况，暴乱中有3000多名非军人受伤，200余人死亡，包括36名大学生。这当中，有罪有应得的暴徒，有被误伤的群众，还有正在现场执行任务的医护人员、联防人员和维护秩序工作队员等。对于被误伤的群众和执行任务中受伤害的人员，政府要认真地做好善后工作。
    由于“美国之音”造谣和一些人有意传谣，社会上一度盛传，戒严部队进城之后，“血洗天安门广场”，“有数千人甚至上万人倒在血泊之中”。真实情况是，戒严部队进入广场之后，凌晨1时半，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部发出紧急通告：“首都今晚发生了严重的反革命暴乱”，“凡在天安门广场的公民和学生，应该立即离开，以保证戒严部队执行任务”。这个紧急通告用高音喇叭，进行了反复播放，时间长达3个多钟头。这时，停留在广场上静坐的青年学生集中在广场南端人民英雄纪念碑一带。3时左右，他们经过内部磋商，派出代表向戒严部队表示，愿意自动撤出广场，戒严部队当即表示同意。凌晨4时半，广场上广播了戒严部队指挥部的通知：“现在开始清场，同意同学们撤离广场的呼吁。”同时，广播了北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部关于迅速恢复天安门广场正常秩序的通告。停留在广场上的数千名青年学生听到通告后，打着各自的旗子和横幅等，两边布置了手拉手的纠察队，于5时左右离开广场。为了保证学生们的安全撤离，戒严部队在广场东侧南口开出了一条宽阔的通道，保证学生顺利、平安地离开。这时，还有一些坚持不走的学生，戒严部队按照“通告”要求，强制他们离开了广场。到5时半，清场任务全部完成。广场静坐的学生，包括最后被强制离开的，没有死一个人。有人造谣说，广场“血流成河”，自己是“从死人堆里爬出来的”，完全是胡说八道。
    以天安门广场重新回到人民手中和戒严部队全部到位为标志，首都反革命暴乱被一举粉碎。在平息反革命暴乱的过程中，中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警不怕牺牲，英勇战斗，建立了不朽的功勋。人民群众救护伤员、解救被围困的战士、积极配合和支援戒严部队，涌现出许多动人心弦的好人好事。由于动乱和反革命暴乱，北京市的经济蒙受了巨大的损失，其他方面的损失更难以用金钱来计算。广大工人、农民、知识分子正在为挽回遭受的损失，进行艰苦的劳动。现在，首都各项秩序基本恢复正常，全国局势也较快地趋于平稳，这反映了中央的正确决策得到了全国各族人民的拥护。但是，动乱和暴乱尚未彻底平息，极少数反革命暴乱分子不甘心灭亡，仍在进行种种破坏活动，甚至梦想卷土重来。
    为了取得制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利，我们要放手发动群众，加强人民民主专政，把清查反革命暴乱分子的工作进行到底。要彻底揭露动乱和暴乱的阴谋，依法惩处动乱和反革命暴乱的组织者和策划者，即那些长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场和搞政治阴谋的人，同海外、国外敌对势力相勾结的人，向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人，以及制造打，砸、抢、烧、杀等种种暴行的刑事犯罪分子。要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，通过坚决果断、艰苦细致的工作、集中打击极少数首恶分子和拒不改悔的顽固分子，尽力扩大教育面和团结面。在此基础上，依靠广大群众，努力增产，厉行节约，艰苦奋斗，尽快把动乱和反革命暴乱造成的损失全部夺回来。
    委员长、各位副委员长和委员！
    我国制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的正义斗争，得到了世界上许多国家政府和人民的理解和支持。对此，我们表示衷心的感谢。但是，在国际上也有一些国家，主要是美国和西欧某些国家，歪曲事实真相，进行造谣中伤，甚至对我实行种种的所谓谴责和制裁，掀起反华浪潮，粗暴干涉我国内政。对此，我们深表遗憾。对于一切外来压力，我国政府和人民过去没有屈服过，现在不会屈服，永远也不会屈服。谣言必将破产，真相终将大白于天下。我国将毫不动摇地以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放。我国将一如既往地坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续发展同世界各国的友好关系，为维护世界和平和促进世界发展继续作出自己的贡献。
