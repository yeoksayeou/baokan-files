History will forever remember this day.

On June 3rd and 4th, 1989, during the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, a heroic unit born in the early days of our army undertook the arduous task of advancing to Tiananmen Square and clearing the area. This unit, which has fought bravely across the country in wartime and made significant contributions to defending and building the nation in peacetime, has once again, in this critical moment of turmoil in the capital, followed the orders of higher authorities with a firm belief and clear stance. They have demonstrated the spirit of fearlessness in the face of hardship and sacrifice, advancing to Tiananmen Square on time and completing the clearing mission with brother units. They have once again made great contributions to the Party, the country, and the people.

Advancing through the "Stone Rain," Removing Barriers, and Moving Forward Tenaciously

On June 3rd, in Beijing, the turmoil created by a few individuals had escalated into a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion. The core members of the illegal organizations "High Autonomy Federation" and "Workers' Autonomy Federation," along with a handful of vicious rebels, had cut off transportation, set buildings on fire, smashed military vehicles, seized weapons, and kidnapped, beaten, and killed soldiers of the martial law troops. They openly aimed to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, subvert the People's Republic of China, and their counter-revolutionary arrogance was extremely rampant.

The flag of the Republic will not be defiled by counter-revolutionary rebels! At this critical moment, the People's Liberation Army, with the interests of the country and the people above all else, stepped forward according to the instructions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission.

On the evening of June 3rd, this unit received orders to advance to Tiananmen Square to carry out the clearing mission. At this moment, the ten-mile-long Chang'an Street was filled with a few rebels spreading rumors and inciting chaos. Uninformed crowds blocked the streets, and major intersections were filled with barriers made of concrete separators, iron fences, telephone poles, and various vehicles, causing great difficulties for the unit's advance.

As soon as the unit set out, a group of counter-revolutionary rebels wielding wooden sticks and steel bars attacked from both sides of the road, shouting and beating the officers and soldiers. Many comrades were injured, many car windows were shattered, and the unit's movements were seriously hindered. The unit leaders made a firm decision: We are carrying out the sacred mission entrusted to us by the Constitution to defend the People's Republic of China and the capital. No matter how many difficulties and dangers there are, we must advance without hesitation.

The leaders at all levels of the unit organized the officers and soldiers to propagate to the crowds while commanding everyone to get off the vehicles, form teams on both sides of the vehicles, protect the vehicles with people, and move forward in a coordinated manner. The officers and soldiers sang military songs and shouted slogans, their fearless demeanor and formidable formation advancing like a rolling tide, overwhelming the rebels' arrogance.

At the Fuxingmen Overpass, the rebels placed public buses, trucks, and trailers in three layers across the road, frantically pouring gasoline on the vehicles and setting them on fire. Immediately, thick smoke billowed, and flames roared, scorching people so they couldn't get close. The leaders and advance units of the certain mechanized unit, motorized infantry unit, and artillery unit, who were advancing side by side, were enraged and fearless in the face of the rebels' crazy obstruction. With a command, the officers and soldiers quickly rushed towards the burning vehicles that could explode at any moment. Some pushed with their hands, some pushed with their shoulders, and some used sticks to pry. Many soldiers' clothes were on fire, and their hands, faces, and arms were burned, but they paid no heed, pushing the burning vehicles to the side of the road and continuing to advance.

The loader operator Li Zhen of a certain engineering company, with the cooperation of training officer Wang Shunzhang and deputy driver Lü Zhiyun, drove the loader to clear obstacles for the unit. When they reached an intersection, a group of rebels attacked them crazily. Li Zhen was injured in multiple places on his head and limbs, but he didn't stop to bandage himself and continued to clear the way for the unit. Suddenly, three rebels climbed onto the moving loader, smashing the windshield with stones and attempting to seize the steering wheel. Li Zhen pressed his left hand on the head wound, operated the steering wheel with his right hand, and accelerated towards the obstacles in front, throwing the three rebels to the ground. When he saw that the rear convoy was blocked by new obstacles set up by the rebels, he turned around and returned to clear the obstacles, ensuring the unit's advance.

During the advance, the officers and soldiers bravely protected the weapons and equipment, preventing the rebels from seizing and destroying them. The driver Qi Xinjian of a certain tank company snatched back two submachine guns that had been seized by the rebels while enduring the rebels' tear gas. The political instructor Liu Fuling of the seventh company of a certain regiment saw five rebels carrying a bundle of seized guns slipping away to a dark place and immediately led six soldiers to take back the guns. A truck carrying eight radios of a certain communications battalion suddenly broke down, and a group of rebels came to burn the vehicle with gasoline. Military doctor Wang Qingbao organized the soldiers to form a "human wall" to protect the vehicle, enduring the rebels' beatings and stone-throwing, and pushed the radio truck to a safe area.

A towing vehicle of a certain high-altitude artillery company had just left its base when the oil pipe was smashed by the rebels, making it unable to move. A group of rebels shouted, "Flip it over, burn it!" At this critical moment, should they abandon the vehicle or push it forward? The four officers in charge made a decisive decision: The vehicle stays as long as the people do, and we must not let the rebels destroy it! They divided the tasks: Company Commander Peng Hu led the soldiers to open the way in front, Deputy Company Commander Ma Jufa led part of the soldiers to guard the sides, and Political Instructor Wang Jianzhuang led part of the soldiers to push the vehicle from behind. The nearly 10-ton towing vehicle moved forward with the shout of "One, two!" Forty-plus officers and soldiers were all injured, but not one of them faltered. Seven officers and soldiers collapsed from overwork and severe injuries, and they were carried onto the vehicle to continue advancing. Thus, the layers of obstacles did not stop them, the rebels' siege did not disperse them, and the extreme fatigue did not knock them down. They pushed the towing vehicle loaded with weapons and other military supplies to Tiananmen Square.

In Critical Moments, Leading from the Front, Commanding at the Forefront

In this difficult advance, the leaders at all levels deeply realized the weight of their responsibilities. To complete the task of quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion entrusted by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, they acted with a strong sense of mission, leading from the front and inspiring the unit with their exemplary actions.

The commander of a certain motorized infantry unit led from the front from the start, handling situations as they arose; when a certain artillery unit encountered rebel attacks, the commander personally led the unit to advance tenaciously...

During the forced advance, the chief of staff of a certain unit led the assault team to clear the way from the front. When the unit reached an intersection, the path was blocked by a burning vehicle set on fire by the rebels. He decisively ordered the assault team, "Comrades, push it aside!" As soon as the words were out, he rushed forward, smashed the window, crawled into the driver's seat of a vehicle, and turned the steering wheel, helping the soldiers push the vehicle to the side of the road.

The political director Wang Jianwei of the "Red Army Regiment" braved the assault of bricks and tiles, leading the way to drive away the rebels and clear the obstacles. He held a megaphone, directing and propagating to the crowds. When the megaphone was broken, he shouted loudly; when his hands and feet were injured, he let the soldiers support him and continued to direct.

The commander of a certain artillery battalion, Zheng Jiasen, was injured in 11 places but always led the entire battalion's formation from the front.

A certain artillery regiment was advancing under the "stone rain" when suddenly, the vehicle carrying the officers and soldiers of the fourth company was attacked by the rebels and caught fire. The entire vehicle was engulfed in flames, and the 39 officers and soldiers on the vehicle were in danger. Security officer Wang Qiang saw this scene and voluntarily asked the leadership to stay behind and handle it. He pushed through the crowd, approached the burning vehicle, and helped the fourth company officers direct the evacuation. Due to the large number of onlookers, the stones and bricks thrown by the rebels were flying everywhere, and more than 20 injured soldiers could not be rescued, and other personnel were also in danger. He quickly thought of a plan and shouted, "The car is going to explode!" Immediately, the crowd dispersed. He seized this opportunity, organized the company officers to count the personnel and weapons, and contacted the firefighters to send the seriously injured to the hospital. However, they hadn't gone far when they were intercepted by the rebels and the onlookers. Wang Qiang, with the help of a citizen with a sense of justice, sent the injured to the 301 Hospital. Then, he changed into civilian clothes and walked to catch up with the unit. Along the way, he saw that part of the tanks and armored vehicles of the brother units were blocked by obstacles, and a group of rebels attacked the soldiers inside the vehicles from all sides, injuring many soldiers. Seeing the lives of his comrades in serious danger, he rushed forward and rescued four injured soldiers from under the rebels' stones and sticks. As more and more comrades were injured, he quickly ran to a nearby unit and, with tears, said to the staff, "These soldiers are our comrades and also your children. Please, no matter what, help rescue them." The people present were deeply moved. With the support of the security department and the crowds of that unit, 62 injured officers and soldiers were rescued and sent to a nearby military hospital in time. Later, 69 besieged officers and soldiers were safely transferred.

The officers of the third battalion of a certain regiment proposed: We would rather shed more blood ourselves, but we must protect the safety of the soldiers. When traveling by car, the officers all sat on the outer side of the car, surrounding the soldiers in the middle; when the rebels threw stones at the unit, the officers used their bodies to protect the soldiers.

The officers' actions of leading from the front and caring for the soldiers were silent commands, forming a powerful collective force for the unit.

Facing Complex Situations, Facing Bloodshed and Sacrifice, the Soldiers Made Their Choice

This was an extraordinary difficult advance. Not only were there crisscrossing barriers and rebel attacks, but the rebels were also mixed with many uninformed crowds, making it difficult to distinguish between good and bad, adding great difficulties to the unit's handling of the situation. Facing this situation, the unit leaders were very clear: Although our unit has excellent equipment and a "sweeping thousands of troops like a mat" tough style, in the current situation, we must strictly follow the policies and disciplines, both to severely crack down on a few rebels and resolutely complete the tasks assigned by higher authorities, and to pay attention to protecting the safety of the majority of the people as much as possible. Along the way, more than 1,100 officers and soldiers of this unit were injured, of which 159 officers and soldiers were seriously injured, and 6 comrades sacrificed their lives. More than 100 wheeled vehicles and armored vehicles were burned, and more than 90% of the vehicles had their windows shattered. But the officers and soldiers still endured humiliation and restraint, showing the soldiers' sincere love for the people.

Facing the rebels' crazy attacks, so many young soldiers were injured, but they remembered the Party's teachings, choosing to shed their own blood and sacrifice themselves rather than injuring a single civilian. This is the choice made by the soldiers.

Moreover, when their lives were seriously threatened, the officers and soldiers also bravely protected the safety of the people's lives and property.

During the advance, the deputy company commander Wang Zhicheng of the fifth company of a certain tank regiment was injured by the rebels and in great pain. But when he saw a young woman also injured by the rebels in the chaos, he forgot to bandage his wound, endured the pain, and risked his life to carry the young woman to a relatively safe place 200 meters away.

The company commander Xu Guangen of the third company of a certain regiment organized the soldiers to gather 160 bicycles scattered on the west side of Tiananmen Square, neatly arranged them, and assigned people to guard them. Later, they handed them over to the relevant local departments without losing a single one.

Ask, from ancient times to the present, which army has been so benevolent and magnanimous!

Overcoming numerous difficulties and breaking through layer upon layer of obstacles, this unit finally, with astonishing willpower and tenacious style, advanced to Tiananmen Square in the early morning of June 4th.

The arrival of this heroic unit gave the counter-revolutionary rebels a great shock. However, a few rebels still refused to give up and put up a desperate resistance. They incited uninformed crowds to surge towards Tiananmen Square. To ensure that the students on the square could withdraw quickly and the clearing mission could proceed smoothly, the officers and soldiers, despite their fatigue, quickly sealed off the east and west entrances of the square. The rebels, ignoring the martial law troops' warnings, waved their fists and shouted slogans, continuing to incite the crowds to charge towards the square.

Around 2:00 AM, the secretary-general of the "High Autonomy Federation," Guo Haifeng, led a group of thugs and crazily drove a public bus loaded with gasoline barrels and Molotov cocktails from the northeast side of Tiananmen Square towards Jinshui Bridge, attempting to burn the military vehicles and then set fire to Tiananmen Gate. The unit immediately bravely stopped the vehicle and captured Guo Haifeng and six other rebels.

Around 2:30 AM, there was chaos under the "Goddess of Democracy" statue. A group of rebels mixed among the students shouted, "We will die with the 'Goddess'!" The officers and soldiers witnessed this scene and were extremely angry. Tiananmen Square is a sacred and solemn place, how can this indecent thing defile it! To strike down the rebels' arrogance and destroy their spiritual pillar, Company Commander Zhang Dongxu led eight soldiers, pushed through the crowd, and quickly arrived under the "Goddess" statue. They explained to the crowd: Building the "Goddess" statue on Tiananmen Square not only violates urban planning regulations but also goes against the wishes of the people nationwide, and it must be removed. After propaganda, most students and citizens left. However, a few rebels remained at the base, vowing to defend the "Goddess" statue to the death. The soldiers forcibly drove them away. They then removed the wooden boards at the base of the "Goddess" statue and pushed with all their might. With a loud crash, the 10-meter-high "Goddess" statue, which the "High Autonomy Federation" worshipped as the "savior," was toppled.

At around 4:30 AM, the clearing began. After the students left the square, the officers and soldiers of this unit, along with the brother units, under the unified command of the higher authorities, carefully checked each tent, confirmed that there was no one inside, dismantled the tents, cleaned the square, and removed the garbage. At 5:30 AM, they successfully completed the clearing mission of Tiananmen Square.

After the baptism of the battle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion, a few days later, Tiananmen Square appeared even more solemn and beautiful. The Tiananmen Gate was magnificent and splendid, the Monument to the People's Heroes stood tall and proud, and the wide Chang'an Street was filled with a steady stream of vehicles... The officers and soldiers looked up at the rising sun and the slowly rising five-star red flag, their hearts surged with emotion, and they were filled with excitement. They were proud and contented for their blood and sweat in defeating this counter-revolutionary rebellion and defending the Party Central Committee, the Republic, and the people's peaceful labor.

The Republic will never forget them!

The people will never forget them!

History will record their merits!

    共和国不会忘记他们
    ——戒严部队某部向天安门广场开进执行清场任务纪实
    刘福祥　栗蕲春　魏厚敏　李全茂
    历史，将永远记住这个日子。
    1989年6月3日、4日，在平息首都反革命暴乱的斗争中，有一支诞生于我军初创时期的英雄部队，担负了向天安门广场开进并进行清场的艰巨任务。这支部队在战争年代转战南北，屡建奇功；在和平建设时期又为保卫祖国、建设祖国做出了贡献。今天，在首都发生反革命暴乱的严重时刻，他们遵照上级的命令，以坚定的信念、鲜明的立场，发扬不怕艰难困苦、不怕流血牺牲的精神，按时开进到天安门广场，与兄弟部队一道，圆满完成了清场任务，为党、为祖国、为人民立下了新的功勋。
    冒着“石雨”，排除路障，顽强向前开进
    6月3日，在首都北京，少数人制造的动乱已经发展成为一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。盘踞在天安门广场的非法组织“高自联”、“工自联”的骨干和一小撮凶恶的暴徒，断绝交通，焚烧楼房，砸烧军车，抢夺武器，肆意绑架、殴打、杀害我戒严部队官兵。他们明目张胆地要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆中华人民共和国，反革命气焰极为嚣张。
    共和国的旗帜岂容反革命暴徒玷污！在这危急关头，视祖国和人民利益高于一切的中国人民解放军，按照党中央、国务院、中央军委的指示，挺身而出了。
    6月3日晚，这个部队奉命向天安门广场开进，执行清场任务。此刻，十里长安街上，一小撮暴徒四处造谣煽动，一些不明真相的群众阻塞街头，主要路口布满了用水泥隔离墩、铁栅栏、电线杆和各种车辆设置的层层路障，给部队的开进造成极大困难。
    部队刚一出发，一伙反革命暴徒便挥舞木棒、钢筋，从道路两旁向部队袭来，狂喊谩骂、袭击殴打部队干部战士，许多同志被砸伤，许多汽车玻璃被击碎，部队行动严重受阻。部队首长下定决心：我们担负的是宪法赋予的保卫中华人民共和国、保卫庄严首都的神圣使命，就是有千难万险，也要毫不犹豫地开进。
    部队各级领导一边组织干部战士向群众宣传，一边指挥大家下车，在车辆两侧结队，以人护车，车随人行，首尾相顾，整体开进。干部战士们高唱军歌，高呼口号，那无畏的气概、威武的阵容，犹如滚滚浪潮向前推进，压倒了暴乱分子的嚣张气焰。
    在复兴门立交桥上，暴徒们把公共汽车、卡车、拖车分3层横在路上，气急败坏地往车上浇汽油，放火焚烧。顿时，浓烟滚滚，烈焰腾腾，炙烤得人们不能靠近。正在齐头并进的某机械化部队、摩托化步兵部队和炮兵部队领导及先头分队，面对暴徒的疯狂拦阻，怒火中烧，临危不惧。随着一声令下，干部战士们迅速扑向正在熊熊燃烧、随时都可能爆炸的汽车，有的用手推，有的用肩顶，有的用棍撬。许多战士衣服被烧着，手、脸、胳膊被烧伤，他们全然不顾，把一辆辆燃烧的汽车推到了路边，继续向前开进。
    某工兵连装载机手李振，在作训参谋王顺长、副司机吕志军的配合下，驾驶着装载机，为部队清障开道。当行至一个路口时，一伙暴徒对他们疯狂袭击。李振头部、四肢多处受伤，他顾不上包扎，继续为部队开道。突然，3名暴徒爬上行驶着的装载机，用石块将挡风玻璃砸碎，企图抢夺方向盘。李振左手按住头部伤口，右手操纵方向盘，对着前方的障碍物猛加油门，将3名暴徒甩到地面。当他看到后边车队又被暴徒新设置的障碍物挡住时，又调头返回，清除障碍，保证了部队的开进。
    开进途中，干部战士奋不顾身地保护武器装备，防止暴徒的抢夺和破坏。某坦克连驾驶员齐新建，冒着暴徒施放的催泪瓦斯，夺回两支被暴徒抢走的冲锋枪。某团七连指导员刘富龙，发现5名暴徒抬着一捆抢去的枪支向暗处溜走，立即带领6名战士冲上前去，把枪夺了回来。某通信营一辆载有8部电台的汽车突然发生故障，一伙暴徒抬着汽油前来烧车。军医王庆保组织战士用“人墙”保护车辆，冒着暴徒们的棍打石砸，将电台车推到安全地带。
    某高炮连一辆牵引车刚从驻地开出，油管就被暴徒砸断，无法行驶。一伙暴徒边砸边叫嚷：“掀翻它，放火烧掉它！”在这危急时刻，是弃车而走，还是推车前行？带车的4名干部果断决定：人在车在，决不能让暴徒将车毁掉！他们做了分工：连长彭虎带领战士在前面开路，副连长马居发带领部分战士在两旁护卫，指导员王建庄带领部分战士在后边推车。近10吨重的牵引车，在“一——二——”的号子声中向前移动。40多名干部战士全被打伤，但没有一个人畏缩。7名干部战士因劳累过度，受伤较重，晕倒在地，大家把他们抬上车继续前进。就这样，层层路障没有挡住他们，暴徒的围攻没有冲散他们，极度的疲劳没有累倒他们，他们硬是把这台装载着武器和其它军用物资的牵引车，推到了天安门广场。
    危急关头，身先士卒，到最前边去指挥
    在这次艰难的开进中，各级领导干部深深意识到，自己肩上的担子很重。为了完成党中央、国务院、中央军委交给的平息反革命暴乱的任务，他们以强烈的使命感，身先士卒，以自己的模范行动给部队以强大的感召力。
    某摩托化步兵部队部队长从出发地开始就一直走在部队前面，临机处置情况；某炮兵部队遇到暴徒的袭击，部队长亲自带部队顽强开进……
    在强行开进中，某部参谋长一路率领突击队在前面开道。当部队行至一个路口时，被暴徒点燃的汽车挡住了去路。他果断地命令突击队：“同志们，推开它！”话音刚落，他一个箭步冲上去，砸碎玻璃，钻进一辆汽车的驾驶室，手把方向盘，配合战士把车推到了路边。
    “红军团”政治处主任王建伟顶着砖头、瓦块的袭击，带头驱赶暴徒，排除路障。他手持话筒，边指挥，边向群众宣传。话筒被打坏了，就大声呼喊；手、脚被打伤了，就让战士扶着指挥。
    某炮兵营营长郑家森身上11处受伤，始终冲在全营队伍的前面。
    某炮团正冒着“石雨”前进中，突然，四连官兵乘坐的汽车被暴徒袭击起火，整个车体被大火吞没，车上39名干部战士处于危急之中。保卫干事王强见此情景，主动找领导请求留下处理。他拨开人群，挤近燃烧着的汽车，帮助四连干部指挥人员疏散。由于围观的人多，暴徒砸来的石块、砖头满天飞，20多名受伤的战士救不出去，其他人员也身处险境。他急中生智，高喊一声：“车要爆炸！”顿时，人群向外离散。他抓住这个时机，一边组织连队干部清点人员和武器，一边与消防队员取得联系，把伤势较重的伤员送往医院。但是，他们没走多远，又被暴徒和围观的人群截了回来。王强在一位有正义感的市民的协助下，将伤员送到301医院。然后，他着便装步行追赶部队。途中，他看到兄弟部队部分坦克、装甲车被路障拦阻，一伙暴徒从四周向车内的战士袭击，许多战士被打伤。看到战友生命受到严重威胁，他冲上前去，又从暴徒的石块和棍棒下救出4名受伤的战士。被打伤的战友越来越多，他迅速跑到附近的一个单位，流着泪对工作人员说：“这些战士是我们的战友，也是你们的子弟，请你们无论如何帮助营救。”在场的人很受感动。在该单位保卫处和群众的支援下，又救出62名受伤的官兵，及时送往附近的部队医院。尔后，又将被围困的69名官兵安全转移。
    某团三营全体干部提出：宁可自己多流血，也要保护战士的安全。乘车行进时，干部都坐在车厢外侧，把战士围在中间；当暴徒向部队投掷石块时，干部用自己的身体护住战士。
    干部靠前指挥和关心爱护战士的行动，是无声的命令，使部队形成了强大的整体力量。
    面对复杂局面，面对流血牺牲，子弟兵做出了自己的选择
    这是一次非同寻常的艰难开进。不仅有纵横交错的路障，有暴徒的袭击，更在于暴徒与许多不明真相的群众混杂在一起，良莠难分，给部队处置情况增加了极大的困难。面对这种局面，部队领导十分清醒：尽管我们部队有着优良的装备和“横扫千军如卷席”的过硬作风，但在眼前情况下，必须严格执行政策纪律，既要严厉打击极少数暴乱分子，坚决完成上级赋予的任务，又要注意最大限度地保护广大人民群众的安全。一路上，这个部队有1100多名干部战士被打伤，其中159名干部战士受重伤，有6名同志光荣牺牲，有100多台轮式车辆和装甲车被烧坏，90％以上车辆的玻璃被击碎。但指战员们仍忍辱负重，极力克制，体现了子弟兵对人民群众的一片赤诚之心。
    面对暴徒们的猖狂袭击，那么多年轻战士被残害，他们牢记党的教导，宁可自己流血牺牲，也尽量不误伤一个市民。这就是人民子弟兵做出的选择。
    不仅如此，指战员们在生命受到严重威胁时，还奋不顾身地保护人民群众生命财产的安全。
    开进途中，某坦克团五连副连长王志成被暴徒砸伤，疼痛难忍。但当他看到一名女青年在混乱中也被暴徒打伤时，便顾不得包扎伤口，忍着剧痛，冒着危险，把这位女青年背到200米外一个比较安全的地方。
    某团三连连长徐官根组织战士，把散落在天安门广场西侧的160辆自行车收拢在一起，摆放整齐，并派人看护，尔后，一辆不少地交给地方有关部门。
    试问，古往今来，哪有如此仁义、大度的军队！
    胜利开进广场，清除“脓包”，捣毁“女神”像，为平息反革命暴乱做出贡献
    克服重重困难，冲破道道障碍，这个部队终于以惊人的毅力、顽强的作风，于4日凌晨1时30分，浩浩荡荡开进天安门广场。
    这支英雄部队的到来，给反革命暴徒以极大的震慑。但是还有极少数暴徒仍不甘心，负隅顽抗。他们煽动不明真相的群众向天安门广场涌来。为了让广场上的学生尽快撤出，保证清场任务的顺利进行，指战员们不顾疲劳，迅速封锁广场东西路口。暴徒们不顾戒严部队的警告，挥舞拳头，狂喊口号，继续煽动群众向广场冲击。
    2时左右，“高自联”常委、秘书长郭海峰带领一伙歹徒，疯狂地将一辆装有汽油桶和燃烧瓶的公共汽车，从天安门广场东北侧向金水桥突然开来，妄图烧毁军车，进而焚烧天安门城楼。部队立即奋勇上前将车拦住，一举将郭海峰等6名暴徒全部抓获。
    凌晨2时多，“女神”像下一片混乱，一伙暴徒混在学生中间，叫嚷着“誓与‘女神’共存亡”。指战员们目睹此景，气愤至极。天安门广场是神圣庄严的地方，岂能让这个不伦不类的东西玷污！为了打击暴徒们的嚣张气焰，摧毁他们的精神支柱，连长张东旭带领8名战士，穿过人群，迅速来到“女神”像下，向群众说明：在天安门广场建造“女神”像，既不符合城建规定，又违背全国人民的意愿，必须拆除。经过宣传，大部分学生和市民纷纷离去。但在底座旁还有几个暴徒，声言要誓死保卫“女神”像。战士们强行将他们驱走。随即拆掉“女神”像底座的木板，奋力一推，“轰”的一声，这座高10米，被“高自联”奉为“救世主”的“女神”像被推倒了。
    凌晨4时半，清场开始。广场上的学生撤离之后，这个部队的干部战士和兄弟部队一道，在上级首长统一指挥下，一个帐篷一个帐篷地细细查看，确定里面无人后，拆除帐篷，清扫广场，清除垃圾。5时半，胜利完成了天安门广场的清场任务。
    经过平息反革命暴乱的战斗洗礼，几天之后，天安门广场显得更加庄严、秀丽，天安门城楼雄伟辉煌，人民英雄纪念碑巍峨挺拔，宽阔的长安街车辆川流不息……指战员们仰望着东升的旭日和徐徐升起的五星红旗，心潮澎湃，激情满怀。他们为胜利粉碎这场反革命暴乱，为保卫党中央、保卫共和国、保卫人民的和平劳动付出血汗而感到欣慰和自豪。
    共和国不会忘记他们！
    人民不会忘记他们！
    历史将记下他们的功绩！
