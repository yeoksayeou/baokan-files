Gold miners stranded in the uninhabited Kekexili region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau have run out of food, and their situation is critical. This morning, the air force dispatched helicopters to air-drop food supplies to them.

Since May 25, at least 5,000 gold miners traveling to the gold mines in Kekexili have been stranded. According to incomplete statistics, the number of gold miners who have died from various high-altitude diseases has risen to 36.

Ge'ermu City, which is in charge of organizing the rescue efforts, has since June 21 attempted to use heavy-duty tractors to escort vehicles carrying food supplies into the stranded area, but the attempt failed due to muddy roads.

He Da'an, the mayor of Ge'ermu City and the commander-in-chief of the rescue operation, said that today's airdrop included 8.5 tons of cooked food.

    空军出动飞机投送食品  援救可可西里被困金农
    据新华社西宁7月7日电　（记者党周）身陷青藏高原西北部可可西里无人区的部分淘金农民已断粮，情况危急。今天上午，空军出动直升机向他们投送食品。
    从5月25日到今天，被困在进入可可西里金矿路途的淘金农民至少有5000人。据不完全统计，被困金农因患各种高山疾病死亡的人数已增加到36人。
    负责组织救援的格尔木市，从6月21日以来，试图用大马力拖拉机护送装运食品的车辆强行进入被困地段，但终因道路泥泞开不进去。
    格尔木市市长、救援总指挥何大安说，今天空投的熟食共8.5吨。
