	Beijing Department Store Promotes Sales with Discounts

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10 (Reporter Ní Xiǎolín) Facing the new market situation of fewer out-of-town visitors to Beijing and declining sales, Beijing Department Store has recently taken a series of measures to promote sales with thin profits and benefits for consumers. This has quickly attracted many locals, restoring normal sales. Yesterday, the store's sales reached 1.9 million yuan, setting a new record for the best daily sales.

	Firstly, timely price reductions were implemented for seasonal items with high inventory.

	Secondly, benefits were passed on to consumers. A batch of soap imported from Shanghai, with the price reduced from 2.25 yuan to 1.90 yuan, saw sales increase from a few dozen bars per day to 3,960 bars.

	Thirdly, the role of state-owned commerce in stabilizing prices was played, coordinating with product manufacturers to jointly reduce gross profit and lower selling prices.

    北京百货大楼让利促销
    据新华社北京7月10日电　（记者倪小林）面对外地来京客减少、销售额下降的市场新情况，北京市百货大楼近来采取一系列薄利多销、让利于消费者的措施，很快吸引了许多市民，恢复了正常销售。昨天，这家商场的销售额达190万元，创历史日正常销售最好水平。
    首先，对库存大的时令商品及时削价处理。
    第二，向消费者让利。上海进的一批香皂，售价由2.25元降到1.90元后，销售便由1天销数十块，增加到3960块。
    第三，发挥国营商业平抑物价的作用，与产品生产厂家协调，共同降低毛利，降低销售价格。
