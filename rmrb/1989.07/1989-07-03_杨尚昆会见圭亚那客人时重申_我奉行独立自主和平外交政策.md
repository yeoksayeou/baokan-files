	Yang Shangkun, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, met with a delegation from the Guyanese National Assembly led by Speaker Sassie Narain today. He emphasized that China adheres to a policy of reform and opening up, and pursues an independent and peaceful foreign policy, without aligning itself with any major power or bloc.

	He stated that China's problems should be resolved independently by China itself. Some Western countries exerting pressure on China is, of course, not a good thing, but China is not afraid. Ultimately, China's development relies on its own strength. China is full of confidence and can overcome any difficulties.

	Yang Shangkun believes that some Western countries have adopted emotionally charged and short-sighted approaches. However, with time, they will gradually understand China and change their views.

	Yang Shangkun mentioned that during the recent turmoil and riots, due to the limited reach of Chinese media, it was difficult for foreigners to obtain accurate information about the situation in China. On the other hand, foreign media, including those hostile to China, have dominated the narrative.

	He said that it is natural for foreign friends to be unfamiliar with the situation in China. Many of them have expressed concern about the situation in China and hope for a quick restoration of stability, offering various opinions. This is because they lack understanding of the situation, but their intentions are good.

	Narain stated that the visit of the Guyanese National Assembly delegation at this time shows that they stand with China. Guyana understands the stance taken by the Chinese government during the turmoil.

	Yang Shangkun expressed his gratitude, saying, "Your visit demonstrates sympathy, understanding, and support for China."

	He noted that the turmoil also revealed that China's legal system is not yet perfect. If the legal system were more complete and robust, the riots might not have escalated to such a large scale. The National People's Congress should do a lot of work in legal system construction. He hopes that the two countries' legislatures will strengthen exchanges.

	In discussing bilateral relations, both Yang Shangkun and Narain agreed that China and Guyana are good friends. The two countries will continue to develop cooperation in various fields.

	Yang Shangkun mentioned that cooperation projects in textiles, construction, and other sectors will continue, and new avenues for cooperation will be explored.

	Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Ni Zhifu and others attended the meeting.

	The Guyanese parliamentary delegation is scheduled to depart tomorrow for Nanjing, Wuxi, Shanghai, and other cities for visits and tours.

    杨尚昆会见圭亚那客人时重申
    我奉行独立自主和平外交政策
    新华社北京七月三日电　（记者姜鲁榕）国家主席杨尚昆今天在这里会见由议长萨西·纳拉因率领的圭亚那国民议会代表团时强调，中国坚持改革开放政策，奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，不依附于任何大国或国家集团。
    他说，中国的问题应由中国自己独立自主地解决。一些西方国家对中国施加压力，这当然是不好的事，但中国不怕。因为归根结底，中国的发展还是要靠自己的力量。中国是充满信心的，可以克服遇到的困难。
    杨尚昆认为，现在有些西方国家采取了感情冲动和缺乏长远眼光的作法。但随着时间的推移，他们会逐步了解中国，会改变的。
    杨尚昆说，在最近的动乱和暴乱中，由于中国新闻媒介力量不够，外国很难听到关于中国暴乱的真实情况。而另一方面，外国新闻媒介包括仇视中国的新闻机构的声音却占了主要地位，被广为传播。
    他说，外国朋友不了解中国情况是自然的。他们中不少人对中国局势表示担心，希望中国局势很快平定，并表示了这样或那样的意见。这是因为他们不了解情况，他们的愿望是善良的。
    纳拉因说，圭亚那国民议会代表团这时来中国访问表明他们是同中国站在一起的。圭亚那理解中国政府在动乱中采取的立场。
    杨尚昆对此表示感谢。他说，“你们的来访表明了对中国的同情、理解和支持。”
    他认为，从这次暴乱中也看出中国的法制还不健全。如果法制完备和健全的话，暴乱可能不会发展到这样大的规模。全国人大要在法制建设方面做大量工作。他希望两国议会加强往来。
    在谈到两国关系时，杨尚昆和纳拉因都认为中国和圭亚那是好朋友。两国将继续发展在各个领域的合作关系。
    杨尚昆说两国在纺织、建筑等领域的合作项目将继续下去，并要开辟新的合作渠道。
    全国人大常委会副委员长倪志福等参加了会见。
    圭亚那议会代表团定于明天离京去南京、无锡、上海等地参观访问。
