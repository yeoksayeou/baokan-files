Over 200 experts from China and abroad gathered in Beijing to call for water conservation and source development to balance supply and demand. The International Water Supply and Drainage Conference concluded today.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 15 (reporters Yang ZhaoBo and intern Bao AnJun) The International Water Supply and Drainage Conference concluded today in Beijing. Over 200 Chinese and foreign experts attending the conference unanimously called for water conservation and source development to address the water supply and demand imbalance in many cities in North China and coastal areas.

It is reported that currently, more than 100 cities in China face insufficient water supply, with 40 cities experiencing severe water shortages. Nationwide, the daily water deficit totals over 1,000 tons. Experts believe this is primarily due to China's limited water resources. China's per capita water resources are only one-fourth of the global average, especially in northern cities where water resources are extremely scarce. Another reason is the severe water wastage in Chinese cities, particularly in industrial water use. In North China, three major steel plants consume 25 to 56 tons of water to produce one ton of steel, which is five to ten times the consumption of industrialized nations.

Experts believe that water conservation and source development must be elevated to a strategic level, treated with the same importance as population and food, and regarded as a national policy. To achieve this, corresponding administrative, economic, legal, and technological measures must be implemented to strengthen scientific management and balance water supply and demand.

During the conference, Chinese and foreign experts visited water treatment plants and sewage treatment facilities in Beijing and Tianjin. Experts from the United States, Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Japan highly praised China's water supply and drainage technology. They said, "China is a beautiful country with lush mountains and clear waters. Many scientists have turned polluted water into clean water, which is truly remarkable." Currently, Beijing's social life is normal and orderly, unlike the rumors circulating outside. The Chinese government is sincerely and consistently implementing the policy of reform and opening up. They expressed their desire to visit more of this beautiful country.

    二百多中外专家在京呼吁
    节水开源力求供需平衡
    国际给水排水学术会议闭幕
    据新华社北京7月15日电　（记者杨兆波、实习生包安隽）国际给水排水学术会议今天在北京结束。参加会议的200多名中外专家一致呼吁：要节约用水，开发水源，解决华北和沿海许多城市水资源供需紧张的局面。
    据介绍，目前，我国有100多个城市供水能力不足，其中有40个城市严重缺水，全国总计每天缺水1000多万吨。专家们认为，这主要是因为我国的水资源不足。我国水资源人均值只相当于全世界水资源人均值的1／4，尤其是北方地区城市，水资源相当缺乏。另一个原因是因为我国城市浪费水的现象极为严重，工业用水耗量太大。华北地区三大钢厂，每生产一吨钢就耗水25吨至56吨，为工业发达国家的五至十倍。
    专家认为，必须把节水和开发水源提高到战略地位来认识，与人口、粮食一样，当作国家的国策来对待。要做到这一点，必须采取相应的行政、经济、立法和技术措施，加强科学管理，取得水资源的供需平衡。
    会议期间，中外专家们还参观了北京、天津的水源厂和污水处理装备。美国、英国、法国、苏联、日本等国专家对中国的给水排水技术给予了高度的评价。他们说，中国是个美丽的国家，山青水秀。许多科技工作者用自己的智慧把污水变成了清洁的水，真是了不起啊。目前，北京社会生活正常、秩序井然，不像外边的谣传那样。中国政府是诚心诚意始终如一的执行改革开放政策的。他们表示还要多走一走，多看一看这个美丽的国家。
