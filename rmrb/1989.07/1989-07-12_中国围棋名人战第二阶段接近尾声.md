Reporter Miú Lǔ reports from Tongsha, July 11th: Today, two young masters of the Chinese Weiqi world faced off again to determine the higher ground. Despite falling into a disadvantage early in the game, Moneyu Ping, a 9th dan player, remained calm and ultimately turned the tables, forcing the 8th dan player Yu Bin to concede defeat. Prior to this, both Moneyu and Yu had each secured four wins and one loss, placing them at the top of the standings in the second stage of the Weiqi Masters Tournament (Qiong Lian Cup).

In this match, Moneyu played white. His initial position was already low, and in the right-bottom corner, he missed an opportunity to roll and strike on the 44th move, which allowed Yu to seize the initiative and establish a strong position in the middle of the game. Not long ago, the two had faced off three times in the Weiqi King Tournament, with Yu losing all three matches. At this moment, he seemed unprepared for the sudden shift in momentum, lacking the resolve to quickly finish off his opponent. Instead, he played a slow move. Moneyu seized the opportunity, smiling as he played a series of brilliant moves, gradually turning the tide of the game. By the time Moneyu entered the reading time, the advantage had shifted. When Moneyu placed his 246th stone, blocking a gap in his territory, Yu felt there was little room left for strategic maneuvering and decided not to continue. The game ended in a mid-game victory for Moneyu, but upon closer inspection, the difference was only about one stone.

The results of the other three matches today were as follows: Nie Wei Ping, the Weiqi Saint, playing white, won in the middle game against Yang Hui, a 7th dan player; Ma Xiao Chun, a 9th dan player, playing black, won in the middle game against Cheng Xiao Liu, a 6th dan player; Wang Qun, an 8th dan player, playing white, defeated Yang Jin Hua, a 6th dan player, by one and a quarter stones.

The final round of the second stage will take place the day after tomorrow. At that time, Moneyu's opponent will be Nie Wei Ping, and Ma Xiao Chun, who has the same score as Moneyu, will face Yang Hui. If Moneyu continues his winning streak and defeats Nie, and Ma secures another victory, the right to challenge will be decided by a rapid game between Moneyu and Ma. According to experts, this possibility cannot be ruled out at this moment.

    中国围棋名人战第二阶段接近尾声
    本报通什7月11日电　记者缪鲁报道：今天，中国围棋界的两位“少壮派”高手在此间再次分定高低。开局不久即落下风的钱宇平九段处逆境而不惊，终于反败为胜，最后迫使优势尽丧的俞斌八段推枰认输。在此之前，钱、俞二人均以四胜一负的战绩，在围棋名人战第二阶段（琼联杯）积分表上靠前。
    此役，钱宇平执白，布局时位置本已偏低，在右下角定型中又因第44手该滚打而未滚打吃了大亏，遂使俞斌趁势在中盘走成大模样。不久前，两人曾在棋王战中三度交手，俞斌连败3场。此刻，他显然没有料到天平会一下子倒向自己一方，缺乏尽快将对方完全置于死地的精神准备，无意中走出缓着。钱宇平看准时机，笑吟吟地连出妙手，四下盘剥对方的实空，使盘上形势逐渐改观，至钱率先进入读秒时，双方优劣已互易其位。当钱投下第246手，挡住自家势力范围的一个空隙时，俞斌认为盘上可供斗智的余地已寥寥无几，不足以施展，当下表示不投了。这盘棋以中盘胜而告终，但停钟后细算，双方实际只差一子左右。
    今天其它三盘比赛的结果是：聂棋圣执白中盘胜杨晖七段；马晓春九段黑棋中盘胜程晓流六段；王群八段白棋以一又四分之一子优势力克杨晋华六段。
    第二阶段最后一轮赛事将于后天进行。届时，钱宇平的对手是聂卫平，和钱积分相同的马晓春对杨晖。如钱挟胜攻克雄关，马再下一城，挑战权的归属还须由钱、马加赛快棋决定。据行家分析，目前尚不可排除此种可能性。
