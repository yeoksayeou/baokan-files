Zaire and Belgium, under the mediation of Morocco, signed an agreement today in Rabat to eliminate disputes between the two countries.

According to the agreement, Belgium decided to cancel all debts that Zaire was supposed to repay to Belgium and to restore mutual trust and friendly cooperation between the two countries.

Since last November, when Martens visited Zaire, disputes over debt issues had arisen between Zaire and Belgium, leading to deteriorating relations between the two countries. Under the mediation of King Hassan II, leaders of Zaire and Belgium held multiple meetings and reached a consensus on resolving the existing problems in their bilateral relations, leading to a reconciliation.

    扎比签署消除分歧协定
    新华社拉巴特7月26日电　扎伊尔和比利时在摩洛哥调停下，今天在这里签署一项关于消除两国分歧的协定。
    根据协定，比利时决定取消扎伊尔应偿还给比利时的全部债务，并恢复两国之间相互信任和友好合作关系。
    自去年11月马尔滕斯访扎以来，扎、比两国因债务等问题产生分歧，扎、比关系日趋恶化。在哈桑二世的调停下，扎、比两国领导人进行了多次会晤，并就解决两国关系中存在的问题达成了一致意见，重归和好。
