	Due to recent heavy rainfall, reservoirs in North China have seen a significant increase in water levels. As of 6 AM today, the water storage in major reservoirs has nearly doubled compared to the same period last year, bringing welcome relief to the drought-stricken region. According to information from the Ministry of Water Resources, since July 21, extensive areas in North China have experienced moderate to heavy rain. This has led to an increase of 500 million cubic meters of water in 30 major reservoirs, making this year's water storage the best in recent years for the same period.
