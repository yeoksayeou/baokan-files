Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, July 16th.

A new hybrid rice combination named "Guangyouqing" has been successfully developed by the Guangdong Academy of Agricultural Sciences and will soon be widely promoted.

In 1988, the hybrid rice underwent regional trials at 16 locations across the province, achieving the highest yield and surpassing the current most widely promoted variety, "Shanyou 63," by 12.7% per mu. This year, during the early rice season, nearly 10,000 mu were tested in eastern, western, and central Guangdong, all showing significant increases in yield.

The "Guangyouqing" hybrid rice is characterized by its excellent stem and leaf morphology, large panicles with many grains, ease of seed production, and high yield.
