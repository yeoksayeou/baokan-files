Today afternoon, the Chinese Red Cross Society held a grand ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, presented the Florence Nightingale Medal, the highest honor in the international nursing community, to four nurses: Lin Juying, Lu Yuzhen, Zhou Xuanjun, and Sun Xiulan. He also awarded the gold cup for voluntary blood donation, the highest honor in China for voluntary blood donation, to seven workers: Zhang Guoqiang, Qiu Zhiqing, Wang Boshan, Pan Defu, Liu Guangzhen, Wang Yuqing, and Feng Guoqing, who have each donated over 3400 milliliters of blood.

The four nurses who received the Florence Nightingale Medal have dedicated themselves to the humanitarian cause of the Red Cross for many years, making significant contributions to nursing in China (their stories were published in the May 27 issue of this newspaper, page 5). Since 1983, a total of 11 nurses in China have received this honor, setting an example for the country's 830,000 nursing professionals.

Beijing worker Pan Defu has donated blood 17 times since 1984, totaling 5800 milliliters, making him the person who has donated the most blood voluntarily in the country. Their selfless spirit is particularly moving.

State Councilor Li Tieying and honorary president of the Chinese Red Cross Society Zhao Puji attended the award ceremony. After the ceremony, the capital's artists performed a wonderful art program.
