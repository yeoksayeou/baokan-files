The Communist Party of China Anhui Provincial Committee and the Anhui Provincial People's Government recently made decisions to remove Wen Yuankai, a professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, from his positions as a member of the Party Group of the Anhui Provincial Education Commission and as a deputy director of the Anhui Provincial Education Commission.

In the _Decision_, the Communist Party of China Anhui Provincial Committee and the Anhui Provincial People's Government pointed out that Wen Yuankai has long obstinately adhered to a bourgeois liberalization stance. During this turmoil, he issued so-called "urgent appeals" multiple times and went to Tiananmen Square to give speeches, inciting disturbances. The Communist Party of China Anhui Provincial Committee and the Anhui Provincial People's Government have decided to conduct a thorough investigation into Wen Yuankai's problems during the turmoil and to handle the matter seriously.
