The United States' latest strategic bomber, the B-2 Stealth Bomber, made its maiden flight successfully in California today.

The B-2 Stealth Bomber is primarily constructed from lightweight composite materials, resembling a bat in shape. It has a length of 21 meters and a wingspan of 52 meters. It can carry a payload of 25 tons of nuclear or conventional bombs and can evade radar detection. Even without refueling mid-flight, it can fly 16,000 kilometers. However, the B-2 Stealth Bomber is extremely expensive, costing $5.3 billion per unit, making it a contentious issue domestically. The military believes that despite the high cost, the aircraft is worth it, and the U.S. needs such planes. The Department of Defense has requested that Congress allocate $50 billion over the next 6 to 7 years for production. Meanwhile, congressional members have expressed doubts about the aircraft's performance and high cost. Some legislators advocate for continued funding for research without rushing to purchase the planes in large quantities.

    B—2隐形轰炸机首航成功
    本报华盛顿7月17日电　记者张启昕报道：美国最新式的战略轰炸机——B—2隐形轰炸机今天在加州首航成功。
    这架B—2隐形轰炸机大部分用轻质复合材料制成，形似蝙蝠，机身长21米，机翼跨度52米，可载25吨重的核炸弹或常规炸弹，可以避开雷达而不被发现；即使中途不加油，也能飞行16000公里。但B—2隐形轰炸机造价高昂，每架5.3亿美元，成为国内一个有争议的问题。军方认为，虽然花钱，但很值得，美国需要这种飞机，国防部要求国会在今后6至7年内拨款500亿美元用于生产。而国会人士则认为这种飞机造价太高并对其性能提出疑问。有的议员主张继续拨款研究，而不急于花大笔钱用于采购。
