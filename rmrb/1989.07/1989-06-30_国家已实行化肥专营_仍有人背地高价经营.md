The state's implementation of a monopoly on fertilizers has played a positive role in promoting agricultural production, alleviating the supply-demand imbalance of agricultural production materials, and preventing the resale of fertilizers, price gouging, and the infiltration of substandard products into the market. However, currently, some units and individuals are still involved in the fertilizer business. The Enterprise Office of Shika Town purchased 220 tons of imported urea, with a retail price of 1,580 yuan per ton, which is 40 yuan higher than the supply and marketing cooperative's price. The price control department of our city has stipulated the maximum prices for various materials. For example, the selling price of ammonium bicarbonate per ton should not exceed 460 yuan. However, in the adjacent cities of Yulin and Guiping, the selling price of ammonium bicarbonate per ton is 500 yuan. Therefore, some units and individuals from other counties are rushing to buy ammonium bicarbonate in our city. If this situation continues, the agricultural supply and marketing market will be in chaos again!

    国家已实行化肥专营  仍有人背地高价经营
    化肥实行专营，对发展农业生产，缓解农业生产资料供求矛盾，制止倒买倒卖、哄抬价格和假劣货混入市场起了一定积极作用。但目前仍有个别单位和个人插手经营化肥。石卡乡企业办公室购买进口尿素220吨，每吨零售价1580元，比供销社牌价高40元。我市物价局曾规定了各类物资的最高限价，如碳铵每吨售价不得超过460元。但是，毗邻的玉林市和桂平县每吨碳铵的售价为500元，于是外县一些单位和个人便到我市抢购碳铵。如此下去，农资供销市场岂不又乱了套？！
