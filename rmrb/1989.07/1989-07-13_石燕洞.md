About 12 kilometers northeast of Ciping in Jianping Mountain lies the village of Li Ping. At the village entrance, there is a mountain named Da Qing Shan, which stands at an altitude of over 900 meters and connects to the famous Tongmu Ling outpost. The entire mountain is covered in dense forests and boasts beautiful scenery. Halfway up the mountain, there is a natural limestone cave. Because stone swallows (bats) reside inside, people call it "Stone Swallow Cave."

Stone Swallow Cave is one of the major natural attractions in Jianping Mountain. It takes about half an hour by car from Ciping to reach the cave. The cave entrance is about 3 meters wide. By climbing down the vines, one can enter the cave. The cave is 150 meters deep, and at the bottom, there is a natural underground palace. Inside the cave, there are numerous interconnected passages. Currently, seven large interconnected rock caves have been discovered, with a total length of about 1,000 meters. The largest cave is 60 meters high and 50 meters long, capable of accommodating over a thousand people. The smallest cave is also impressive, standing at 20 meters high and about 30 meters wide and long. These caves feature layered rock formations and peculiar rock shapes. Inside the largest cave, there is a 50-meter-tall stalagmite. Its surface is shiny and smooth, resembling a mirror. Upon closer inspection, the front appears to depict several Buddha statues, faintly visible. To the left, it looks like a lotus seat with a goddess, resembling the Goddess of Mercy, flanked by two attendants standing elegantly. To the right, it seems to depict several lotus flowers with a frosty appearance, as if emitting a subtle fragrance. The cave walls are adorned with numerous stalactites, stalagmites, stone columns, stone pillars, stone flowers, and other natural formations, creating a dazzling array of colors and a breathtaking spectacle. The most remarkable feature inside the cave is the "Pillar of the Sea" and the "Turtle Drumming." A tall stone pillar presses down on a stone turtle, which appears to be resisting with its eyes wide open, making it a lifelike scene. From the large cave, turning right into a smaller cave, on the rugged cliff, stands a stone lion with a mane. It has bright eyes and a majestic posture, overseeing the visitors. On the left side of the stone wall, there is a group of colorful stalactites forming a beautiful peacock image. The peacock seems to be dancing, welcoming the visitors.

Currently, Stone Swallow Cave is one of the main attractions in the Jianping Mountain scenic area. Together with nearby attractions such as the Luofu Reservoir, Shijie, Tongmu Ling, and Jiangnan Village, it forms a complete tourist route, allowing visitors to fully enjoy the scenery.

    石燕洞

    井冈山茨坪东北面约12公里远的梨坪村头，有一座海拔900余米、紧连著名桐木岭哨口的大青山。全山林木深蔚，风景秀丽。半山腰，有一个天然的溶洞。因洞内栖息着石燕（蝙蝠），人们称它为“石燕洞”。
    石燕洞是井冈山的一大天然胜景，从茨坪乘车约半小时就可到达。由3米多宽的洞口，攀藤而下可进入洞内，洞深150米，到了洞底，便见天然的地下宫殿。洞中四通八达，现已探明有7个相连的大岩洞，全长约1000米，最大的洞高60米，长50米，可容纳千余人，最小的也高达20米，长宽各30余米。这些洞岩层积叠，怪石峥嵘。大洞内有一块50米的石乳，表面光彩夺目，好似一面镜子。细细看去，正面像菩萨数尊，若隐若现；左侧如莲花座，座上的女神，俨然观音老母，旁边两神女，婷婷玉立，作侍奉状；右侧似有莲花数朵、冰霜清姿，仿佛散发着幽香。洞厅的岩壁，有许许多多石乳、石柱、石钟、石笋、石花相接而成天然璧画，五光十色，琳琅满目。洞中最奇的景致是
  “定海针”和“神龟击鼓”，一根顶天石柱，紧紧压住神龟，神龟不甘受压，怒目而视，维妙维肖。从大洞拐入右侧的小洞里，在那嶙峋峭壁之上，站着一尊披鬃石狮。它双目炯炯、雄姿勃勃，俯视着游人。在左侧的石壁上，有一群色彩斑斓的钟乳石，组成一幅美丽的孔雀图。这孔雀好似正展屏起舞，欢迎游人。
    现在，石燕洞已列为井冈山风景区主要景点之一，与附近的罗浮水库、石姬、桐木岭、江南村等七个景点形成一个完整的旅览体系，让游人尽兴赏玩。
