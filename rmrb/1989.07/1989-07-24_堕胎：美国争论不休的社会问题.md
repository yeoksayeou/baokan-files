In the United States, the legality of abortion has been a contentious social issue for decades. On July 3, the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court, by a narrow 5-4 majority, upheld a Missouri state law restricting abortion. Although this ruling did not completely overturn the Supreme Court's 1973 decision (which affirmed women's right to abortion), it gave states the freedom to enact laws restricting abortion. Consequently, the ruling reignited the debate between the opposing sides. Opponents hailed the ruling as the first step in repealing the 1973 decision and called for other states to follow Missouri's example by enacting laws banning abortion; proponents, meanwhile, criticized the ruling as malicious and vowed to minimize its impact.

Historically, abortion in the United States was legal. In the mid-19th century, the American Medical Association launched a movement that only prohibited unlicensed physicians from performing abortions, without any written laws restricting abortion. It was not until 1959 that a research group called the American Law Institute drafted an abortion law, stipulating that abortion was legal in only five circumstances, such as when pregnancy threatened a woman's life, seriously endangered her health, or resulted from rape. Based on this, some states enacted certain restrictive laws. From then on, the debate intensified. In 1973, the Supreme Court ruled on an abortion case, affirming women's right to abortion and deciding that states could not restrict women from having abortions within the first three months of pregnancy.

Now, the Supreme Court's ruling upholding Missouri's law, though specific to one state, has had a nationwide impact. According to Missouri's 1986 law, public hospitals are prohibited from performing abortions (unless the pregnant woman's life is in danger), state funds cannot be used for abortion consultations for women, and doctors must perform tests to determine if the fetus can survive before the procedure, among other regulations, making abortion extremely difficult. Commentators on the court's ruling believe that, while this ruling may not have a significant impact on other states in the near term, it has encouraged a trend of states imposing restrictions on abortion.

In the 1980s, approximately 1.5 million abortions were performed annually in the United States. The court's ruling has had a minimal impact on the wealthy, who can afford to travel to other places for the procedure or pay private practitioners, but it poses significant challenges for young people and the poor. For this reason, the court's ruling has sparked a massive response in American society.

    堕胎：美国争论不休的社会问题
    本报记者　张启昕
    在美国，堕胎是否合法，是一个争论了几十年的社会问题。7月3日，美国最高法院的9名最高法官以5对4票的微弱多数作出一项裁决，维护密苏里州限制堕胎的法律。这项裁决虽然没有全盘推翻最高法院1973年的裁决（即妇女有权堕胎），但却给各州以制定限制堕胎法律的自由。因此裁决一经宣布，对立两派的争论再次激化。反对者庆贺裁决是废除1973年决定的第一步，要求各州效法密苏里州，制订禁止堕胎法律；主张者则批评这是个恶意的裁决，誓要缩小裁决的影响。
    从历史上看，堕胎在美国本是合法的。19世纪中叶以后，美国医学协会掀起一个运动，也只是禁止无执照医师进行堕胎手术，并没有成文的法律限制堕胎。直到1959年，一个名为美国法律学会的研究团体起草了一个堕胎法，提出只有在5种情况下堕胎是合法的，例如怀胎威胁妇女生命、严重损害妇女健康，或因强奸而怀孕等。在此基础上，一些州通过了某些限制性法律。从此，争论开始激烈。1973年，最高法院曾对一起堕胎案作出裁决，肯定了妇女的堕胎权利，裁定各州不得限制妇女在怀孕的前3个月堕胎。
    现在，最高法院作出维护密苏里州法律的裁决，虽是对一个州而言的，影响却波及全国。因为根据1986年的密苏里州法律，禁止公共医院作堕胎（除非怀孕妇女生命垂危）手术，禁止使用州经费为妇女作堕胎咨询，并要求医生在手术前必须试验胎儿能否生存等等，这些规定使堕胎十分困难。人们在评论法院裁决时认为，虽然这一裁决在近期内对其它各州影响不大，但助长了各州对堕胎施加限制的趋势。
    在80年代，美国每年大约有150万例堕胎。这次法院的裁决对富有者来说影响微小，他们有钱旅行到别处进行手术，也付得起私人开业医生的费用，但对青年人、贫困者来说，就困难多了。正因为这样，法院的裁决在美国社会激起了巨大的反响。
