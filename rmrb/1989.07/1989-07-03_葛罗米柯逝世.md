	Andrey Gromyko Passes Away

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 3: The famous Soviet diplomat Andrey A. Gromyko passed away on July 2 in Moscow at the age of 80.

	According to TASS, the news of Gromyko's death was announced by Soviet leader Gorbachev at the Soviet Supreme Soviet meeting held today. The attendees immediately stood up to observe a moment of silence for the deceased.

	Gromyko was born on July 18, 1909, in a peasant family in present-day Belarus. He joined the party in 1931 and graduated from Moscow Institute of Economics, Minsk Agricultural Academy, and the graduate class of the All-Union Institute of Agricultural Economics of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. He then served as a senior researcher at the Economic Research Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Since 1939, he has worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, serving as the ambassador to the United States and the United Kingdom, the representative to the United Nations, and the deputy and first deputy minister of foreign affairs. From 1957 to 1985, he served as the foreign minister for 28 years. In July 1985, he was elected as the head of state—the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet.

	During his nearly 50-year diplomatic career, Gromyko personally participated in the resolution of many major international issues in the 20th century. He was the Soviet representative for the preparation of the United Nations and a participant in the negotiations between Stalin and the British and American leaders in Yalta and Potsdam during World War II. After the war, he participated in the resolution of major international issues such as the Soviet-American Caribbean missile crisis. In his later years, he wrote his diplomatic career into a memoir—two-volume "Memoirs," which was published in 1988. In recent years, he has advocated for improving Sino-Soviet relations.

	At the extraordinary plenum of the Central Committee of the CPSU held in March 1985, Gromyko proposed that the youngest Politburo member, Gorbachev, should be appointed as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU. In September 1988, Gromyko resigned from his leadership position and retired "due to health reasons."
