The State Council's leading group for the fourth national population census held a telephone conference today to mobilize and deploy the census work. Li Tieying, State Councilor and head of the State Council's leading group for the fourth national population census, said in his speech that the population census is the largest social mobilization in peacetime, and the task is arduous. From now on, all levels of government must include the population census work in the important agenda, strengthen leadership, and do their best to ensure the completion of the task.

Li Tieying said that the population census is a major investigation of national conditions and national strength. In the nearly 40 years since the founding of the country, China has conducted three national population censuses. The results of these three censuses have played an important role in the development of China's national economy and society. The fourth national population census to be conducted on July 1, 1990, is the basis for formulating China's development strategy and various policies for the end of this century, and is an important scientific basis for formulating the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" and the "Ninth Five-Year Plan."

He said that the population census is a large-scale social system project, involving all aspects of society, and conducting large-scale social investigations into every household requires mobilizing and organizing millions of workers nationwide to participate. The fourth population census faces many difficulties. First, the preparation time for the census, from now until next July 1, is only 11 months, the shortest in history. Second, the work of mobilization and organization is enormous. Third, in recent years, the volume of population migration and mobility has increased significantly, and the social situation is the most complex. Although the census task is arduous, we have the superiority of the socialist system. Relying on the masses and mobilizing social forces to carry out the work is our advantage.

Since last year, the State Council has entrusted the National Bureau of Statistics to do a lot of preparatory work for this census, and many provinces have also done some necessary preparations. We believe that this work can be done well.

    李铁映动员社会各界
    确保完成第四次全国人口普查
    据新华社北京7月25日电　国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组今天召开电话会议动员和部署人口普查工作。国务委员、国务院第四次全国人口普查领导小组组长李铁映在讲话中指出，人口普查是和平时期最大的社会动员，任务很艰巨。从现在起，各级政府都要把人口普查工作列入重要议事日程，切实加强领导，尽心尽力，确保完成任务。
    李铁映说，人口普查是一次重大的国情国力调查。建国近40年来，我国曾经进行过三次全国人口普查。这三次普查工作所取得的成果，都对我国国民经济和社会发展起到了重要的作用。明年7月1日进行的第四次全国人口普查是制定本世纪末我国的发展战略和各项方针政策的基础，是制订“八五”计划、“九五”计划的重要科学依据。
    他说，人口普查是一项庞大的社会系统工程，要涉及到社会各方面、深入各家各户进行大规模社会调查，需要动员和组织全国几百万工作人员参加。第四次人口普查面临的困难很大，一是普查的准备时间，从现在起只有11个月了，是历次时间最短的一次，二是动员和组织方面的工作量大，三是近些年人口迁移流动量大大增加，社会情况最复杂。尽管普查任务相当艰巨，但我们有社会主义制度的优越性，依靠群众，动员社会力量开展工作是我国的优势。
    去年以来，国务院责成国家统计局为这次人口普查做了许多准备工作，许多省也作了一些必要的准备。相信这项工作完全可以搞好。
