“Building a Mature and Combat-Ready Party” is a compilation of two conversations Deng Xiaoping had with a leader of a communist party in Asia on June 14, 1965, and December 27, 1965. In these conversations, Comrade Xiaoping, drawing from the Party’s experience in leading the revolution and construction, deeply summarized the rich experiences in political, ideological, organizational, and work style building, and proposed a series of important thoughts on strengthening the Party’s construction. This is an important document on Party building, with significant practical guidance.

Reform and opening up require our Party to be more mature and combat-ready

“What kind of party to build is not only a problem for our generation but also for the next and the generations to come. The core issue in a country’s revolution is the party. Only with a good party can the revolution be guided to victory. After the revolution’s victory, building socialism also relies on a good party; otherwise, the victory will not be solid.” Comrade Xiaoping’s profound statement tells us that in the period of socialist construction, we still face the question of what kind of party to build. To modernize and carry out reform and opening up, do we still need a party that is armed with Marxism, has a far-reaching goal, a united will, strong combat effectiveness, and leads the country? This should not be a question, but in reality, people’s understanding is not consistent. The practice of reform and opening up in our country has fully proven that to advance socialist modernization construction, we not only need the Party’s leadership but must also strengthen the Party’s leadership. Without or weakening the Party’s leadership, it is not only impossible to achieve victory in socialist construction but will also lead us astray. The key now is that for our Party to grasp this leadership, we must consciously and painstakingly improve ourselves, making the Party truly adapt to the needs of the changing situation, becoming more mature and combat-ready in the process of reform and opening up.

The history of China’s revolution and construction proves that our Party is a mature and combat-ready party. The proposal of the theory of the primary stage of socialism, the establishment of the Thirteenth Congress line, and especially the practice of reform over the past ten years since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, have shown that our Party, after more than 30 years of repeated exploration on both positive and negative sides, has become relatively mature in leading socialist modernization construction. However, just as Comrade Xiaoping analyzed the Party’s maturation process in democratic revolution, the Party also has a process of becoming more mature in leading socialist construction. The basic line of the Party has been proposed, and we need to firmly and better implement it; various issues in the primary stage of socialism also need to be further studied and solved in theory and practice. In fact, in all aspects related to China’s economic and social development, we still have many areas that we have not thoroughly understood. Only when we have thoroughly studied all the basic issues and truly grasped the laws of the primary stage of socialism can we say that we have truly reached a more mature level. We should strive for this.

To better combine Marxism with China’s reality and correctly implement the Party’s political line

A mature and combat-ready party must ensure political correctness and firmness, not only being able to correctly propose tasks and formulate correct lines and strategies but also being able to correctly implement these lines in actual work at different stages of development, formulating and executing a set of correct policies and strategies. To achieve this, drawing from the Party’s entire experience, Comrade Xiaoping clearly pointed out in the article: We must combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practices and actual situations of our country. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Central Committee has done a good job in solving this problem. The Party’s basic line in the primary stage of socialism and Comrade Xiaoping’s clear proposal of the idea of building socialism with Chinese characteristics are both based on China’s actual situation while adhering to the basic spirit of Marxism. However, to truly establish this extremely important guiding ideology throughout the Party is still a formidable task. In this regard, I think that at present, two tendencies must be corrected.

First, in some places and among some comrades, theoretical and policy research lags behind or is detached from the practice of reform. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly said, “Formulating and implementing correct strategies and tactics should be based on the specific situation of the country,” but our research and arguments on the new contradictions and problems that have emerged in the process of reform and opening up are obviously insufficient. Not only is there a lack of necessary forward-looking research and guidance, but even many urgent practical problems are often not researched in a timely manner. Some comrades who engage in actual policy research often overlook China’s specific reality in the current stage. They have read some books, including works on the political and economic systems of Western countries, and have also visited some countries for inspections, which are all good things. The problem is that some people often overlook standing on their own national conditions and instead rely too much on the reasoning of some ready-made theories to construct a blueprint for reform. Such views as abandoning the term “ruling party,” establishing a political system similar to the separation of powers, and denying the principle of “the Party managing cadres” to a certain extent reflect this tendency. Some comrades also study practical problems but only see the obvious surface phenomena, overlooking comprehensive and deeper exploration and research. The methods they propose are bound to encounter difficulties and even conflicts. In view of the above situation, I think it is indeed necessary to emphasize putting the starting point of theoretical and policy research more consciously on China’s national conditions and to be vigilant against tendencies that deviate from reality.

The second tendency is to neglect or even deny the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Some people, although they do not publicly say that Marxism is bad, do not bother to discuss Marxism-Leninism, and even shy away from mentioning it, regarding it as a symbol of rigidity. Some people, although they also acknowledge Marxism, only regard it as one school of thought in academic thought. Some people, seeing that they cannot find ready-made answers to China’s current problems from Marxism-Leninism’s specific discussions, think that Marxism is experiencing a “crisis” or that it has become “outdated.” There are also some comrades who hope to achieve a breakthrough in theory but neither carefully study the original works of Marxism-Leninism and their spiritual essence, especially the scientific stance, views, and methods permeating them, nor intend to study new topics in reality. Instead, they spend more energy on denying some principles and concepts of Marxism-Leninism, thinking that this is innovation and development. This wrong attitude must be firmly opposed. Today, the world is in the midst of a wave of reform. Facing the vivid and rich practice of reform, Marxism must necessarily have great development. This is undoubted. We should also have this ambition and strive for it with solid efforts. However, when we talk about developing Marxism, it is based on adherence, and the two are completely consistent. Focusing on using the scientific worldview and methodology of Marxism to study new problems in reform and construction, seeking law-based understanding, this is the correct direction for expanding and deepening Marxism. As a country that adheres to the direction of socialist development, without this scientific guiding ideology, we will lose our weapon of struggle and direction of advance, and the consequences are unimaginable. In summary, I think that for the entire Party, emphasizing Marxism is not enough but still very insufficient at present. How to better combine the universal truths of Marxism with the specific practices of China’s reform and opening up in the new situation and at a higher level of understanding, and how to raise the level of adhering to and developing Marxism, there is a lot of work to be done now. Only by solving this problem relatively well can our Party take a big step forward in becoming more mature.

To better combine the persistence of communist ideals with the completion of common tasks in the primary stage, and to achieve ideological unity within the Party in the new situation

Implementing reform and opening up and developing socialist commodity production have had the most profound impact on our society, greatly promoting the liberation of thought and the development of production. Now, the thoughts within the Party are indeed more active than before, but it is undeniable that there are also serious confusions. In the new situation, a considerable number of Communist Party members are confused, and some are even disoriented. This is a matter that deserves the high attention of the entire Party. Comrade Xiaoping mentioned that after the Long March, Comrade Mao Zedong focused his main energy on unifying the Party’s ideology. After ten years of effort, he finally achieved the expected goal, making the entire Party mature. I think that now we also need to work hard on this, that is, on the basis of correctly solving the basic theory and basic line, guided by the Thirteenth Congress theory, to systematically study various trends and discussions in society and give correct and convincing answers. Obviously, this work itself is also the process of further maturing and perfecting the Party’s basic theory, and it to a certain extent determines whether the entire Party can truly maintain high unity in action, which is a fundamental issue in Party building at present.

In unifying the Party’s ideology at present, I think we should at least have a relatively clear understanding of some basic points. For example, in the primary stage of socialism, should Communist Party members persist in the ideals and beliefs of communism? What should be their spiritual pillar? What moral behavior norms should be followed in the development of commodity production? etc. It is undeniable that there are different views on all these basic issues within the Party. There is such a view: Since China is still in the primary stage of socialism, we should not talk about the goal and ideals of communism, and even the standards for Party members should be lowered. This is of course wrong. Persisting in the ideals of communism is the essential requirement of the Communist Party, the fundamental guarantee for the Communist Party to have a firm and correct political direction at all times, and the source of the Communist Party’s strength. No matter how distant the realization of communism is, our belief must never be weakened or shaken. Proposing the theory of the primary stage of socialism is only to make the requirements for struggling for communism in this stage more specific and clear, and it is not to blur this goal or even deviate from this development direction. In the primary stage of socialism, Communist Party members must still strictly require themselves as advanced elements of the proletariat, consciously linking the tasks of this stage with the goal of communism, and striving to realize the Four Modernizations and revitalize China. Some people say that now is a pluralistic society, and we should not take communism as the spiritual pillar. Some people even publicly declare that in the primary stage of socialism, “the spiritual pillar is to struggle for personal interests.” Such statements are obviously wrong. If everyone in the whole society struggles for personal interests, how can we talk about inspiring the spirit of the entire nation? How can we talk about building socialism? Comrade Xiaoping pointed out as early as more than two years ago that economic construction has achieved considerable success, and the situation is promising, which is the success of our country. But if the style deteriorates, even if economic construction is successful, what is the meaning? It will deteriorate on the other side and affect the overall economic development, and if it continues, it will form a world where corruption, theft, and bribery are rampant. Comrade Xiaoping’s words are worth every Party member seriously understanding. For Communist Party members, the ideals of communism are forever our source of strength and spiritual pillar. We should raise high the banner of struggling for the ideals of communism for life within the Party and implement it as actual actions in this stage to realize the Four Modernizations and revitalize China. With the spirit of reform and unremitting struggle of Communist Party members and the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, we should firmly establish the belief in communism among the people of the whole country. Some people say that in the current stage of developing commodity production, emphasizing the spirit of dedication of Communist Party members is not appropriate. I think that in the current stage, although we cannot require all social members of different levels to use this spirit, we should require Communist Party members to use it and promote and advocate it among the masses. In the current stage, Communist Party members should of course actively strive to develop socialist commodity economy and also receive the labor remuneration they deserve according to national policies, but they should not commoditize themselves, and even use their power, Party principles, social morality, and personality as commodities for exchange for personal private interests. Communist Party members should take contributing to the Four Modernizations, the country, and the nation as the starting point in all their activities, and realize their personal value in dedication. From this point of view, we can draw a clear line with actions that purely pursue personal interests, correctly handle the relationship between personal interests and the country and the people, adhere to the principle that the interests of the country and the people are above everything else, adhere to selflessness, public before private, others before self, hardships first, and enjoyment later, and in times of need for the country and the people, understand the big picture, consider the overall situation, and willingly take on more responsibilities, endure more hardships, and even make necessary sacrifices.

Now, some comrades criticize that in the past few years, we have talked too much about materialism and too little about spirituality, too much about interests and too little about dedication, to the extent that some moral and ideological concepts that should be advocated have become distorted. This should be highly valued. At present, we need to carry out the work of re-educating Party members and cadres.

In deepening reform, strengthen the construction of democratic centralism within the Party

The Party’s organizational maturity is reflected in many aspects, and Comrade Xiaoping particularly emphasized the issue of democratic centralism in this article. He said: “A party cannot function without centralization. If there is no centralized leadership of the Central Committee and various levels of Party committees, the party will have no combat effectiveness. Such centralization, without a high degree of democracy as its foundation, is false. The whole Party advocates democracy and self-criticism, which can truly unite the will of the whole Party and truly achieve unity.” Comrade Xiaoping’s remarks are very important. As long as the various levels of Party organizations truly, and not just formally, promote democracy and truly concentrate the will of the broad masses of Party members and not just individual will, they can definitely show strong cohesion and become the true leadership core. Some comrades say that the term democratic centralism is not scientific, saying that emphasizing centralization will hinder democracy. I think this is an unscientific view. In fact, any form of democracy as a state form in the world cannot do without centralization; otherwise, it will not be able to form the will of the state and the force to embody this will. The issue is whether it is truly centralized on the basis of democracy and whether it is truly guided and constrained by the collective will. We only oppose the centralized style of one-person rule, including one-person rule with the mere form of democracy, and cannot oppose centralized guidance on the basis of democracy. Comrade Xiaoping clearly emphasized in his meeting with foreign party leaders on October 13, 1978: Democratic centralism is also our advantage, and it is much better than Western democracy, making it easier to unite the people and act quickly. In the new situation of reform and opening up, to strengthen the Party’s leadership and give full play to our political advantages, we must further adhere to and improve democratic centralism. There are many new issues worth studying here, and I will specifically raise three issues below.

First, all levels of leading cadres must consciously adapt to the situation of expanding socialist democracy, learn to use democratic methods and procedures to handle issues, and be good at collecting wisdom from the masses in fully promoting democracy. It must be seen that since the implementation of reform and opening up, the democratic consciousness and participation consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and the people have become increasingly strong, and the legal system has also become increasingly complete. The times have developed to this point, and as leaders, whether you want to or not, you must follow this trend; otherwise, it will be very difficult to carry out work. Some comrades are still not used to making decisions and doing things in a democratic atmosphere, especially after the implementation of the administrative chief responsibility system and the factory director responsibility system, some comrades misunderstand the change in the leadership system as expanding the power of personal dictatorship, opposing efficiency with expanding democracy, and making one-person rule even more serious than before, which is completely wrong. The individual responsibility system is not opposed to the mass line. In the process of reform and opening up, we should still truly promote democracy, encourage and support the masses to express their opinions, and collect wisdom from them. Regardless of the place or department, in formulating every major decision, it should be accustomed to organizing multi-faceted and multi-disciplinary arguments to take the best of both worlds and make the optimal choice.

Second, educate Party cadres to adhere to correct organizational principles in the process of reform. Since the organizational reform, the leading cadres at all levels have basically changed a generation. The new cadres entering the leading cadres, mostly have a strong sense of reform and innovation, but some lack Party life training, are not familiar with the basic knowledge of the Party, and even do not understand the basic rules of the Party. For example, some factory directors actually remove the position of Party committee secretary with administrative orders, and some enterprises even organize the Party committee leadership team in a way similar to forming a cabinet, with the deputy secretary nominated by the secretary and approved by the factory director. Party cadres do not understand the basic organizational principles of the Party, which shows the seriousness of the problem and also puts the task of quickly changing this abnormal situation in front of us. For this, I think that first, when configuring the leading cadres at all levels, we must pay attention to political quality, including the configuration of various administrative leading cadres, which should take understanding the basic knowledge of the Party as the minimum condition. Second, we must resolutely and vigorously train the new cadres entering the leading cadres to make them quickly mature. This matter is related to the healthy growth and development of the leading cadre team of this generation, the next generation, and even generation after generation, and it is not something to be taken lightly.

Third, in the process of reform and opening up and activating the economy, we must strengthen macro-level centralized guidance. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out: Comrade Mao Zedong advocated collective leadership and also advocated that the Party committee should have a leader, and each level of leadership should have a core. “The Central Committee should have a core, the Provincial Committee should have a core, and the County Committee should also have a core. If the core is not strong, it should be cultivated; otherwise, it will become a loose sand.” I think that emphasizing this point is particularly important at present. Implementing reform and opening up, decentralizing power, separating Party and government, and classifying the management of cadres, all require Party organizations at all levels to pay more attention to macro-level guidance and management. This is not only a major form of strengthening leadership in the future but also a basic condition for ensuring the success of these reforms. How to strengthen macro-control? Comrade Xiaoping recently clearly pointed out: “Macro-control should be reflected in the fact that the Central Committee and the State Council can speak and make decisions.” That is, the Party Central Committee and the State Council should have authority, the entire Party must have iron discipline, and the organizational principles of individual submission to the organization, minority submission to the majority, lower levels submission to higher levels, and the entire Party submission to the Central Committee must be seriously implemented. There must be no decentralization, acting on one’s own, and doing things as one pleases. How to ensure necessary centralization and authority while activating things is a new topic. I think we still lack experience and need the collective wisdom of the entire Party to explore and come up with specific and feasible methods. If we can truly solve this problem, the Party’s leadership will be greatly improved and strengthened.

In the new situation, further strengthen the construction of Party style and maintain the purity of the proletarian vanguard

As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech, as a mature party, we have long established a correct party style. Comrade Mao Zedong once summarized it as three major styles. These excellent traditions should be inherited, carried forward, and developed forever. It is noteworthy that in some places and among some comrades, this excellent tradition has gradually faded and been discarded. While many bad styles and corrupt styles have taken the opportunity to spread. Now, there are many discussions about party style within and outside the party. If we do not take this seriously, we will surely lose the hearts of the party and the people. In this sense, strengthening the construction of party style is indeed a matter of the rise and fall of the party’s cause, and it has a special urgency at present. It should be seen that with the deepening of reform and opening up, the construction of the party has already faced a series of new situations and problems, urgently requiring the party to pay more attention to establishing good styles than before. And the position of being in power makes a considerable number of party members and cadres not easily feel the infiltration and harm of corrupt styles. Solving this problem, the key is to put the strengthening of party style construction on the important agenda of party committees at all levels in the process of reform and opening up. At present, first of all, we must loudly call for inheriting and carrying forward the party’s traditional excellent styles, and at the same time, we must also clearly put forward some new requirements according to the problems that have already emerged in reality. Strengthening these two aspects of work involves many problems to be solved. Starting from the current reality, in addition to the previously emphasized problem of combining theory with practice, I think it is very necessary to advocate four styles throughout the party and formulate corresponding normative measures.

First, advocate the style of connecting with the masses and solve the problem of ensuring not to be detached from the masses under the condition of being in power. For Communist Party members, the most dangerous and frightening thing is to be detached from the masses. But now, some party members and party organizations are actually not afraid of being detached from the masses. They always think that they are the ones who manage the masses, and the masses must obey their management; they always emphasize that they are busy with work and have no time to connect with the masses. Now, in some places and units, the relationship between cadres and the masses is already quite tense. The masses do not buy the accounts of such cadres at all, and there is a serious tendency to drift away, which is indeed worrying. This requires our leading organs and Communist Party members to definitely straighten out their relationship with the masses, sincerely connect with the masses, rely on the masses, and equally consult and dialogue with them as their intimate friends. Not only should they lead and organize them to engage in construction and work hard to get rich, but they should also really help them solve difficulties and do good deeds, think about what they think about, and be anxious about what they are anxious about. Only in this way can we widely seek the understanding, support, and participation of the masses in the cause of reform and opening up, truly enhance their sense of responsibility as masters, and inspire their enthusiasm, initiative, and creativity, so as to truly work together with us to overcome the difficulties in the process of advancing and achieve the victory of modernization construction.

Second, advocate the style of criticism and self-criticism. Criticism and self-criticism have always been an important measure for us to timely summarize experience and correct errors, an effective form for the broad masses of party members and cadres to use positive and negative experiences for self-education and improvement, and a prominent feature that distinguishes our party from other political parties. However, for a period of time, some comrades have discarded this weapon, and self-criticism is often lightly described, while criticism is even more difficult to truly carry out. Some people even confuse criticism with persecuting people. To change this situation, we must emphasize maintaining a strong sense of party spirit within the party. Now, the atmosphere of avoiding “ideological struggle,” evading contradictions, not talking about party spirit, and not talking about principles among some party members and cadres is quite serious, which is unacceptable. We Communists have always opposed unprincipled struggles and have always insisted on having a clear party spirit on principle issues. We have indeed suffered too much from the “left” in the past, and in the future, we must never do this again, but we must not go to the other extreme and give up principles and dare not struggle. It should be clear that insisting on criticism and self-criticism is not about beating people with a stick or persecuting people, but about truly caring for and helping people. The purpose of criticism and self-criticism is to “learn from the past and guard against the future, and to cure the sickness to save the patient.” If a comrade has shortcomings or mistakes, criticizing and helping him in a timely manner can make him alert and correct them in time. As long as the motive is correct and the method is appropriate, it is not necessarily offensive or hurtful to people. On the contrary, if one adopts a liberal attitude, being good to each other and harmonious, one may eventually harm this comrade. Therefore, I think that Communist Party members should always take up the weapon of criticism and self-criticism with a clear conscience, insist on carrying out normal and active ideological struggles.

Third, advocate the style of clean governance and solve the problem of preventing corruption under the condition of developing commodity economy. In history, no ruling class has ever jumped out of the cycle from hard work and creation to corruption and destruction. After China transformed from a product economy to vigorously developing a commodity economy, some corrupt phenomena in Party and government organs have intensified, fully demonstrating that in the new situation, the danger of corruption and degeneration of some weak-willed individuals in the position of power is indeed greater than before. To truly maintain the clean governance of the ruling party, it is indeed a big problem. As long as the various levels of Party organizations have a high degree of self-awareness and seriously grasp it, this difficult problem can definitely be gradually solved. The method is what Comrade Xiaoping has repeatedly emphasized: two hands, firmly pushing forward reform and opening up, and unremittingly carrying out the fight against corruption, both grasping education to improve ideological and moral standards and grasping the legal system to strictly enforce Party and state disciplines. For this, first of all, we need to advocate the style of clean governance throughout the Party, and at the same time, seriously promote democracy, strengthen supervision, strictly enforce disciplines, and strengthen the legal system. As long as we do both, we will definitely be able to take a new path of both prospering the economy and maintaining the cleanliness of Party and government organs in the new situation.

Fourth, advocate the style of hard work and struggle and solve the problem of maintaining fighting vitality under the condition of economic prosperity and improved living standards. Hard work and struggle have always been the basic magic weapon of Communist Party members in revolutionary creation, but for a period of time, it was criticized as a small production mentality, and in the minds of some Party members and the masses, it lost its due position. The direct result is that the style of enjoyment, feasting, extravagance and waste, and even decadence and corruption has spread and become rampant, to the extent that it is difficult to stop. The facts have proven that Communist Party members can never abandon the spirit and style of hard work and struggle at any time. The view that economic development should be enjoyed and feasted is wrong, and the view that commodity production should have a “style” is also wrong. Not to mention that China is still very poor and cannot afford half a bit of extravagance and waste, even when it is relatively rich in the future, it is still necessary to be thrifty and hard-working, carry forward the national excellent tradition of “living a rich life like a poor life,” and continue until we achieve the goal for which we are struggling. Communist Party members must not abandon this banner of struggle, otherwise they will be disarmed in ideology and lose the vitality to advance. This is something every comrade should deeply think about.

    坚持党的领导　加强党的建设
    ——读邓小平《建设一个成熟的有战斗力的党》
    陈野苹
    《建设一个成熟的有战斗力的党》是邓小平同志1965年6月14日、12月27日同亚洲一位共产党领导人两次谈话的节录。在谈话中，小平同志结合我们党领导革命和建设的实践，深刻总结了党在政治、思想、组织、作风建设等方面的丰富经验，提出了加强党的建设的一系列重要思想，是党的建设的一篇重要文献，富有现实的指导意义。
    改革开放需要我们党更加成熟，更有战斗力
    “建立一个什么样的党的问题，这不仅是我们这一代的问题，也是下一代、再下一代的问题。一个国家的革命，核心问题是党。有了一个好党才能引导革命走向胜利。革命胜利后，搞社会主义也要靠一个好党，否则胜利就靠不住。”小平同志的这个精辟论断告诉我们，在社会主义建设时期，我们同样面临着建设一个什么样的党的问题。搞现代化，实行改革开放，究竟还需要不需要建设一个像过去为夺取全国政权时那样以马克思主义武装起来的、目标远大、意志统一、战斗力极强、对国家起领导作用的党？这本来不应该成为问题，但实际上人们的认识却并不一致。我国改革开放的实践已经充分证明，推进社会主义现代化建设，不但需要党的领导，而且必须加强党的领导；没有或削弱党的领导，要想取得社会主义建设的胜利不仅不可能，而且会走到邪路上去。现在的关键在于，我们党为着掌握好这种领导权，就必须以高度的自觉和艰苦的努力来改善自己，在改革开放中把党建设得真正适应形势发展的需要，更加成熟，更有战斗力。
    中国革命和建设的历史证明，我们党是一个成熟的有战斗力的党。社会主义初级阶段理论的提出，十三大路线的确立，特别是十一届三中全会以来十年改革的实践，表明我们党经过30多年正反两面几次反复的探索，在领导社会主义现代化建设方面也已经比较成熟了。然而，正像小平同志分析党在民主革命中的成熟历程一样，党在领导社会主义建设中，也还有一个不断走向更加成熟的过程。党的基本路线提出了，有待于我们坚定不移地更好地贯彻；社会主义初级阶段各个方面的问题，也有待于在理论和实践上继续研究解决。事实上，在涉及我国经济社会发展的各个方面，我们都还有许多尚未透彻了解的领域。只有当我们把各个方面的基本问题都探讨清楚了，确实掌握了社会主义初级阶段的规律，才能说真正达到了更加成熟的境界。我们应为此而努力。
    把马克思主义与中国实际更好地结合起来，正确贯彻党的政治路线
    一个成熟的有战斗力的党，必须保证在政治上正确坚定，不仅能正确地提出任务，制定正确的路线和战略，而且能在各个不同发展阶段的实际工作中，正确地贯彻这条路线，制定和执行一整套正确的政策和策略。要做到这一条，集我们党的全部经验，就是小平同志在文章中明确指出的：必须把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同本国的革命实践，本国的实际情况相结合。党的十一届三中全会以来，中央对这个问题解决得非常好。党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，小平同志明确提出的建设有中国特色的社会主义的构想，就是从我国实际情况出发的，同时也坚持了马克思主义的基本精神。但是，在全党真正确立这个极为重要的指导思想，还是一个艰巨的任务。在这方面，我认为当前有两种偏向都必须坚持纠正。
    一是在某些地方、某些同志那里，理论研究、政策研究落后于改革实践，或者游离于这种实践之外。小平同志反复讲，“制定和执行正确的战略和策略要根据本国的具体情况”，可是我们对改革开放中出现的新矛盾和问题，研究和论证显然都很不够。不要说必要的超前研究和引导，就是许多急需解决的实际问题，研究工作也常常跟不上。有的从事实际政策研究的同志，在很大程度上却忽视我国现阶段的具体实际。他们读了一些书，包括西方各国政治、经济体制的一些著作，还跑了一些国家考察，这本来都是好事情，问题在于一些人却往往忽视立足于自己的国情，而过多地凭某些现成学说的推理来构造改革的蓝图。诸如应该摒弃“执政党”的提法，应该建立类似三权分立的政治体制，以及应该否定“党管干部”的原则等等这样一些观点，在一定程度上就反映了这样一种倾向。有的同志也在研究实际问题，却只看到了那些明显的表层的现象，忽视了全面的、更深层次的探索和研究，提出的办法实行起来就难免困难重重，甚至互相打架。鉴于上述情况，在当前提倡更加自觉地把理论、政策研究的立足点放在中国国情上，警惕脱离实际的偏向，我看确实是该强调一下了。
    第二种偏向是忽视甚至否定马列主义、毛泽东思想的指导。有的人虽然并不公开说马克思主义不好，但却不屑谈论马列，甚至耻言马列，认为那不过是僵化的象征。有的人虽然也承认马克思主义，却仅仅把他当作学术思想中的一个流派。有的看到从马列具体论述中找不到当前中国问题的现成答案，就认为马克思主义正在经历着一场“危机”，或者认为它已“过时”。还有一些同志，他们企望在理论上有所突破，但既不精心研习马列原著及其精神实质，特别是贯注其间的科学立场、观点和方法，也无意于研究现实中的新课题，却把精力更多地用在否定马列主义的一些原理和概念上面，还自以为这就是创新和发展。这种错误的态度，是我们必须坚决反对的。当今世界正处于改革的大潮之中，面对生动丰富的改革实践，马克思主义必然会有大的发展。这是毫无疑义的。我们也应该有此雄心壮志，并为此脚踏实地地作出努力。但是，我们讲发展马克思主义，是以坚持为基础的，两者也是完全一致的。集中精力于运用马克思主义的科学世界观和方法论，研究改革和建设中的新问题，寻求规律性的认识，这才是拓展和深化马克思主义的正确方向。作为一个坚持社会主义发展方向的国家，没有这种科学的指导思想，就会失去战斗的武器和前进的方向，后果是不堪设想的。总之，就全党来说，我认为当前强调马克思主义并不是多了，而是还很不够。如何在新的形势下，在更高的认识水平上，把马克思主义的普遍真理同我国改革开放的具体实践更好地结合起来，把坚持和发展马克思主义的水平提高一步，现在是有大量工作该做的。也只有较好地解决了这个问题，我们党才能在更加成熟上迈出一大步。
    把坚持共产主义理想同完成初级阶段的共同任务更好结合起来，在新形势下实现全党的思想统一
    实行改革开放，发展社会主义商品生产，给我国社会最深刻的影响，是大大促进了思想的解放和生产的发展。现在党内思想确实比过去都更加活跃，但不可否认也出现了严重的混乱。在新形势下，确有相当数量的共产党员陷入迷惘，甚至有些晕头转向。这是值得全党高度重视的。小平同志谈到，长征结束后，毛泽东同志把主要精力放在统一党的思想上，经过十年努力，终于达到了预期的目的，使全党变得成熟起来。我认为，现在我们也需要下功夫进行这种工作，就是在正确解决基本理论、基本路线的基础上，以十三大理论为指导，对社会上的各种思潮和议论进行系统的研究，做出正确的有说服力的回答。显然，这一工作本身，同时就是党的基本理论进一步成熟和完善的过程，它在一定程度上决定着全党能否真正保持行动上的高度一致，是当前党的建设的一个根本问题。
    当前在党内统一思想，我以为至少应该在一些基本点上取得比较清楚的认识。比如在社会主义初级阶段，共产党员是否应该坚持共产主义的理想和信念？应该以什么作为自己的精神支柱？在发展商品生产中到底应该遵循什么样的道德行为规范？等等。毋庸讳言，在所有这些基本问题上，党内现在确实是有不同看法的。有这样一种看法：既然我国还处于社会主义初级阶段，就不应该讲什么共产主义目标和理想，甚至党员标准也应该降低了。这当然是不对的。坚持共产主义的理想，是共产党的本质要求，是共产党人无论什么时候都具有坚定正确的政治方向的根本保证，是共产党人前进力量的源泉。不论共产主义的实现有多么遥远，我们的这个信念始终不能有丝毫的淡漠和动摇。提出社会主义初级阶段的理论，只是把现阶段为共产主义奋斗的要求变得更具体更清晰了，决不是要模糊这一目标，甚至背离这一发展方向。在社会主义初级阶段，共产党员仍然必须以无产阶级先进分子的高标准严格要求自己，自觉地把现阶段的任务同共产主义的目标联系起来，立志为实现四化，振兴中华而奋斗。有人说，现在是多元化社会，不应该再把共产主义理想作为精神支柱了。有人就公开宣称：在社会主义初级阶段，“精神支柱就是为个人利益而奋斗”，这种言论显然是错误的。如果全社会每个人都为个人的利益去奋斗了，还怎么谈得上振奋全民族的精神？怎么谈得上建设社会主义呢？小平同志早在两年多前就已经指出：经济建设这一手我们搞得相当有成绩，形势喜人，这是我们国家的成功。但风气如果坏下去，经济搞成功了又有什么意义？会在另一方面变质，反过来影响整个经济发展，发展下去会形成贪污、盗窃、贿赂横行的世界。小平同志的这些话，是值得我们每个党员认真领会的。对于共产党人来说，共产主义理想永远是我们的力量源泉和精神支柱。要在全党高举为共产主义理想而奋斗终生的旗帜，并把它落实为现阶段实现四化，振兴中华的实际行动，以共产党人锐意改革，艰苦卓绝的奋斗精神和全心全意为人民服务的奉献精神，在全国人民中坚定起对共产主义的信仰。有人说，现阶段发展商品生产，讲究价值法则，再强调共产党员的奉献精神不合时宜。我认为，在现阶段，虽然不能用这种精神来要求不同层次的所有社会成员，但却应当用它要求共产党员，并在群众中进行教育、提倡。在现阶段，共产党员当然应当积极努力发展社会主义商品经济，也应当按照国家政策收取应得的劳动报酬，但却不能把自己商品化，甚至为着捞取个人私利而把自己掌握的权力、党的原则、社会道义和人格都当成商品去交换。共产党员在自己的全部活动中，都应当把为四化，为国家，为民族多做贡献作为自己的出发点，在奉献中去实现个人的价值。从这点出发，就能同那种纯粹追逐个人利益的行动划清界线，就能正确处理好个人利益同国家和人民的关系，坚持国家利益、人民利益高于一切，坚持大公无私，先公后私，先人后己，吃苦在前，享受在后，在国家和人民需要时，识大体，顾大局，心甘情愿地多承担一些担子，忍受一些困难，甚至作出必要的牺牲。
    现在有同志批评我们这几年讲物质多了，讲精神少了，讲利益多了，讲奉献少了，以至一些应该提倡的道德思想观念发生了扭曲，这应该引起我们高度的重视。当前，我们对党员、干部需要进行一次重新教育的工作。
    在深化改革中加强党的民主集中制建设
    党在组织上的成熟表现在许多方面，小平同志在这篇文章里特别强调了民主集中制的问题。他说：“一个党不集中不行，如果没有中央和各级党委的集中领导，这个党就没有战斗力。这种集中，如果没有高度的民主作基础，集中也是假的。全党提倡民主、提倡批评与自我批评，就能真正把全党的意志集中起来，真正做到万众一心。”小平同志讲的这段话非常重要，党的各级组织，只要坚持真正地而不是形式地发扬民主，同时真正地集中广大党员的意志而不是单凭个人的意志，就一定可以表现出强大的凝聚力，成为真正的领导核心。有的同志说什么民主集中制的提法不科学，说什么强调集中就会妨碍民主，我看这是一种不科学的看法。事实上，世界上任何作为国家形态的民主制都离不了集中，否则就不可能形成国家的意志和体现这种意志的力量。问题只在于是不是真正在民主基础上的集中，是不是真正的共同意志的指导和约束。我们只反对一言堂式的集中，包括徒有民主形式的一言堂，而不能反对在民主基础上的集中和指导。小平同志1978年10月13日会见外国党领导同志时曾经明确强调：民主集中制也是我们的优越性，它比西方的民主好得多，更容易团结人民，办事迅速。在改革开放的新形势下，为了切实加强党的领导，发挥我们的政治优势，必须进一步坚持和完善民主集中制，这里有许多新问题值得研究，下面特别提出三个问题。
    一是各级领导干部都要自觉适应扩大社会主义民主的形势，学会用民主的方法，按民主的程序处理问题，善于在充分发扬民主中集思广益。必须看到，实行改革开放以来，广大干部群众的民主意识和参与意识日渐强烈，法制也在日趋完备。时代发展到现在，作为领导者，不管你想不想，愿不愿，都必须顺应这种潮流，否则就很难开展工作。有的同志至今还很不习惯在民主的气氛下作决策，办事情，特别是行政首长负责制和厂长负责制推行以后，有的同志把领导体制的这种改变误解为就是要扩大个人专断的权力，把提高效率同扩大民主对立起来，搞一言堂比过去还厉害，这就完全不对了。个人负责制同群众路线不是对立的，在改革开放中，仍然应当切实发扬民主，鼓励和支持群众发表意见，从中集思广益。无论哪个地方哪个部门，制定每一项大的决策，都应习惯于组织多方面、多学科的论证，以便取长补短，作出最优化的选择。
    二是要教育党员干部在改革中坚持正确的组织原则。机构改革以来，各级领导班子基本换了一茬干部。新进领导班子的这些同志，大都具有较强的改革意识和创新精神，但有些却缺乏党内生活锻炼，不熟悉党的基本知识，甚至不懂得党的起码的规矩。比如有的厂长竟以行政命令撤党委书记的职，有的企业组建党委领导班子也搞什么组阁，副书记由书记提名，报厂长审批。党员领导干部如此不懂党的基本组织原则，说明了问题的严重程度，同时也把尽快改变这种不正常状况的任务摆到了我们面前。为此，我看一是在配备各级领导班子时，一定要注意政治质量，包括配备各类行政领导干部，都应当把懂得党的基本知识作为起码的条件。再就是下决心着力培训新进领导班子的同志，使他们尽快成熟起来。这件事关系到这一代、下一代以至代代领导干部队伍的健康成长与发展，是不可掉以轻心的。
    三是在改革开放、搞活经济中一定要加强宏观上的集中指导。小平同志指出：毛泽东同志提倡集体领导，又提倡党委会要有班长，各级领导要有核心。“中央要有核心，省委要有核心，县委也要有核心。如果核心不强，就要培养核心，否则就会成为一盘散沙。”我认为，当前强调这一点尤有重要意义。实行改革开放，下放权力，党政分开，以及分类管理干部等等，要求各级党组织都更加重视宏观指导及管理。这既是今后加强领导的一种主要形式，也是保证这些改革成功的基本条件。怎样才能加强宏观控制呢？小平同志前不久明确指出：“宏观控制要体现在中央能够说话算数。”就是党中央、国务院要有权威，全党必须有铁的纪律，必须认真执行个人服从组织，少数服从多数，下级服从上级，全党服从中央的组织原则，决不能搞分散主义，各自为政，各行其是，有令不行，有禁不止。如何在搞活的同时保证必要的集中和权威，这是一个新课题。我认为我们现在还缺乏经验，很需要全党群策群力进行探索，拿出具体可行的办法来。真要把这个问题解决好了，党的领导就能得到很大改善和加强。
    在新形势下进一步加强党的作风建设，保持无产阶级先锋队的纯洁性
    正如邓小平同志在讲话中指出的那样，作为一个成熟的党，我们党早就树立了一个正确的党风，毛泽东同志曾将它概括为三大作风。这些传统的优良作风，应该永远继承、发扬和光大。值得注意的是，这个优良传统，在一些地方、一些同志那里却逐渐淡化了，丢掉了。而许多不正之风、腐败之风则乘机风行起来。现在党内党外对党风议论很多，再不认真对待，必将使我们失去党心民心。从这个意义上说，加强党风建设，确实事关党的事业兴衰成败，在当前更有特殊的紧迫感。应当看到，随着改革开放的深入，党的建设已经面临着一系列新的情况和问题，迫切要求党比过去更加注意树立好的风气。而执政掌权的地位，又使相当数量的党员和干部不易痛切感到腐败作风的侵袭和危害。解决这个问题，关键是在改革开放中把加强党风建设提上各级党委重要的议事日程。在当前，首先必须大声疾呼继承发扬党的传统的优良作风，同时也要根据现实中已经突出起来的问题，明确提出一些新的要求。加强这两方面的工作，需要解决的问题很多。从当前实际出发，除了前面强调的理论联系实际的问题，我认为很有必要在全党提倡大兴四种作风，并制定相应的规范措施。
    第一，大兴联系群众之风，解决好在执政条件下保证不脱离群众的问题。对共产党人来说，最危险最可怕的事，莫过于脱离群众。可现在有的党员和党组织，刚好就不怕脱离群众，他们总认为自己是管群众的，群众必须服从自己管；总强调自己工作忙，无暇联系群众。现在有的地方和单位干群关系已经相当紧张，群众根本不买这样的干部的帐，存在着严重的离心情绪，确是令人忧虑的。这就要求我们的领导机关和共产党员，一定要摆正自己同群众的关系，真心诚意地联系群众，依靠群众，平等地同他们协商对话，作他们的知心朋友。不仅要带领和组织他们投身建设，勤劳致富，而且要实实在在地帮助他们排忧解难，多办好事，想他们之所想，急他们之所急，不仅要准确了解和掌握他们的脉搏，而且要衷心尊重他们的参政热情和首创精神。只有这样，才能广泛争取群众理解、支持和投入改革开放事业，才能真正提高他们的主人翁责任感，激发起他们的积极性、主动性和创造性，从而真正与我们同心协力克服前进中的困难，夺取现代化建设的胜利。
    第二，大兴批评与自我批评之风。批评与自我批评，历来是我们及时总结经验、修正错误的重要措施，是广大党员、干部运用正面和反面的经验来自我教育、提高的有效形式，是我们党区别于其他政党的一个显著特点。可是，一段时间来，有些同志却丢掉了这个武器，自我批评往往轻描淡写，批评更难于真正开展，有些人甚至把批评和整人混淆起来。改变这种情况，必须强调在党内保持浓厚的党性原则。现在，部分党员干部中，讳言“思想斗争”，回避矛盾，不讲党性，不讲原则的情绪相当严重，这是要不得的。我们共产党历来反对无原则斗争，也历来坚持在原则问题上要有鲜明的党性。我们过去吃“左”的苦头确实太多，今后无论如何不能再搞这一套，但却决不能因此走向另一个极端，放弃原则，不敢斗争。应当明白，坚持批评与自我批评决不是打棍子整人，而是真正的爱护人、关心人。批评与自我批评的目的，是为了“惩前毖后，治病救人”。一个同志有了缺点或错误，及时批评、帮助他，可以使他及早警觉、及时改正。只要动机正确，方法得当，是并不一定引人反感乃至伤害感情的。相反，如果采取自由主义的态度，你好我好，一团和气，最后很可能害了这个同志。所以我认为，我们共产党员永远应该理直气壮地拿起批评与自我批评的武器，坚持开展正常的积极的思想斗争。
    第三，大兴为政清廉之风，解决好在发展商品经济条件下防止腐败的问题。在历史上，历代统治者都没有跳出过从艰苦创业到腐败灭亡的周期率。我国由产品经济转入大力发展商品经济后，党政机关中某些腐败现象加剧起来，充分表明在新的条件下，处于掌权地位的某些意志薄弱者腐化堕落的危险确实比过去更大了，要真正保持执政党的廉洁为政，的确是一个大问题。党的各级组织，只要有了高度的自觉，并认真去抓，这样的难题也是一定能够逐步解决的。办法就是小平同志多次强调的两手抓，既坚定不移地推进改革开放，又坚持不懈地进行反腐败斗争，既抓教育，提高思想品德，又抓法制，严肃党纪国法。为此，首先就需要在全党大兴清廉为政之风，同时认真发扬民主，加强监督，严肃纪律，加强法制。只要这样双管齐下，我们就一定可以在新的形势下，走出一条既繁荣经济，又保持党政机关廉洁的新路。
    第四，大兴艰苦奋斗之风，解决好在经济繁荣、生活提高的条件下永葆战斗活力的问题。艰苦奋斗历来是共产党人革命创业的基本法宝，但在一段时间却被斥为小生产观念，而在部分党员、群众心目中失去了应有的位置。其直接后果，就是享乐风、吃喝风、挥霍浪费之风以至堕落腐败之风滋长蔓延，竟至累禁不止。事实证明，共产党人无论什么时候都不能丢掉艰苦奋斗的精神和作风。那种认为经济发展了就应该尽情吃喝、享乐的观点，那种认为搞商品生产就要“有派头”的观点都是错误的。不要说我国现在还很穷，来不得半点铺张和浪费，就是将来比较富裕了，也还需要勤俭节约，艰苦奋斗，发扬“富日子当穷日子过”的民族优良传统，一直到实现我们为之奋斗的目标为止。共产党人决不可以丢掉这面战斗的旗帜，否则就将在思想上解除武装，丧失进取的活力。这是值得每个同志深思的。
