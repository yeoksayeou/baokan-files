Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently reported to Congress that the Federal Reserve's primary goal will shift from curbing inflation to preventing economic recession. This statement not only reflects his concerns about the U.S. economic outlook but also signals a corresponding change in monetary policy, from tightening to easing.

Greenspan's highly anticipated decision seems to be a "change of course." Generally, the current situation of the U.S. economy is that the growth momentum has significantly weakened, while inflation, though rising, is under control. However, if the deceleration is too rapid, it could lead to a "hard landing"—a recession—rather than the desired "soft landing." Recent official economic indicators, which are mostly negative, have obviously made Greenspan uneasy. In June, industrial production fell by 0.2%, factory operating rates dropped by 0.3 percentage points, the unemployment rate rose to 5.3%, and retail sales decreased by 0.4%; in May, the trade deficit increased by 23.6% compared to the previous month, and the comprehensive leading economic index fell by 1.2%. On the other hand, the economic "cooling down" has eased the pressure on inflation. For example, the producer price index fell by 0.1% in June. It is under these circumstances that Greenspan "changed course," making the prevention of economic recession his top priority.

For the Federal Reserve, the only way to prevent a recession is to ease monetary policy and lower interest rates. In fact, it has already taken some steps in this direction since last month. Although Greenspan did not explicitly state this in his congressional testimony on the 20th, economic circles here generally estimate that the Federal Reserve will further ease monetary policy in the coming period.

However, the degree of easing is likely to be limited, as excessive easing could increase inflationary pressures. Balancing these factors will undoubtedly be a serious challenge for the Federal Reserve. According to its predictions, the U.S. economy will grow by 2% to 2.5% this year and by 1.5% to 2% in 1990, which is lower than the Bush administration's estimates. Although Greenspan believes that there will be no recession in the next two years, he also acknowledges that avoiding both recession and inflation is a "difficult mission," and any policy misstep could lead to a sharp economic downturn. Greenspan even predicted that someday, some event will halt the economic recovery that began at the end of 1982.

Whether Greenspan's "change of course" can prevent the U.S. economy from "running aground" remains to be seen. However, one thing is certain: changes in U.S. monetary policy will have a certain impact on the financial, trade, and economic operations of the West.

### 格林斯潘“见风转舵”

    格林斯潘“见风转舵”
    本报记者　张　亮
    美国联邦储备委员会主席格林斯潘日前向国会作年中经济报告时宣告，联邦储备委员会的首要目标将由遏制通货膨胀转向防止经济衰退。此话不仅表明他对美国经济发展前景的担忧，同时还预示其货币政策将发生相应变化，即从紧缩变为放松。
    格林斯潘的这一众所瞩目的决断似乎可以说是“见风转舵”。总的来看，当前美国经济的运行情况是：增长势头大大减弱，通货膨胀升而有控。但是，如果减速过猛，就可能导致“硬着陆”——衰退，而不是人们所期望的“软着陆”。官方最近公布的一些经济指标凶多吉少，显然使格林斯潘深感不安。6月份工业生产下降0.2％，工厂开工率下降0.3个百分点，失业率升至5.3％，零售额减少0.4％；5月份外贸逆差比前一个月骤升23.6％，经济综合先行指数下降1.2％……另一方面，经济“降温”减缓了对通货膨胀的压力。譬如，6月份批发物价指数下降0.1％。正是在这种情形下，格林斯潘“改变航向”，将防止经济衰退视为当务之急。
    对联邦储备委员会来说，防止经济衰退的办法只能是放松银根、降低利率。事实上，从上个月开始它在这方面就有所动作。格林斯潘20日在国会虽未把话讲明，但此间经济界普遍估计联邦储备委员会在今后一个时期内将进一步放松银根。
    然而，放松的程度恐怕是有限的，因为放得太宽势必加大对通货膨胀的压力。如何掌握平衡，对联邦储备委员会无疑是一个严重的考验。按照它的预测，今年美国经济将增长2％—2.5％，1990年增长1.5％—2％，低于布什政府的估计。尽管格林斯潘认为今明两年内不会发生衰退，但他也承认同时避免经济衰退和通货膨胀是一项非常“棘手的使命”，政策稍有失误就可能导致经济急转直下。格林斯潘甚至还断言，有朝一日，某一事件将会中止自1982年底开始以来的这次经济复苏。
    格林斯潘“见风转舵”能否避免美国经济“触礁”还有待检验。但是有一点可以肯定，美国货币政策的变化将对西方的金融、贸易乃至经济运行情况都将产生一定影响。
