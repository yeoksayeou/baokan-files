A thrilling tennis match unfolded yesterday as veteran American player John McEnroe battled for nearly four hours, ultimately defeating Swedish player Mats Wilander with a score of 3-1 (7-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4) to advance to the semifinals of this year's Wimbledon Championships.

The match between McEnroe and Wilander was a rare spectacle of intense competition. From the start, the score was tightly contested, with neither player able to gain a significant advantage. It was only after Wilander made two forehand errors that McEnroe managed to secure the first set with a 7-6 victory after 73 minutes of fierce play.

Wilander, however, did not falter. He remained composed and effectively countered McEnroe's aggressive tactics, managing to win the second set. In the third and fourth sets, Wilander took the initiative, leading 3-0 and 2-0 respectively. However, McEnroe, the seasoned veteran, maintained his composure and fought back, turning the tables and securing victory. After the match, Wilander admitted, "McEnroe's shots are very difficult to handle. His balls often come straight at my body, making it hard for me to decide whether to use my forehand or backhand."

In the semifinals, McEnroe will face another Swedish star, Stefan Edberg. This will be their first encounter in a major tournament, promising another intense battle.

    扣人心弦的一场网球赛
    网坛老将美国选手约翰·麦肯罗昨天经过近4小时的鏖战，以3∶1（7∶6、3∶6、6∶3、6∶4）战胜瑞典选手维兰德，进入了今年温布尔登网球锦标赛半决赛。
    麦肯罗与维兰德之战是一场少见的激战。比赛一开始，双方比分咬得很紧，难解难分。后来，只是维兰德两个正手击球失误，麦肯罗才在激战73分钟之后，以7∶6拿下第一局。
    维兰德并未气馁，依然沉着应战，使麦肯罗的强攻受到抑制。结果，维兰德扳回第二局。第三、第四局，维兰德先发制人，曾分别以3∶0和2∶0领先。但麦肯罗这位久经沙场的老将控制住自己的情绪，稳扎稳打，终于反败为胜。维兰德在比赛后说：“麦肯罗的球很难对付，球常常直逼我身体，以致我不知是正手还是反手回球好。”
    麦肯罗在半决赛中，将与另一位瑞典名将埃德伯格对阵。他们以前还从未在网坛大赛中相遇过，这肯定又是一场激烈的遭遇战。
