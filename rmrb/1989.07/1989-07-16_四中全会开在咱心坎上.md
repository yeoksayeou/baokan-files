On the eve of July 1st, we visited Huixi Village in Guangshan Township, Dongtai City, Jiangsu Province. The village party branch was organizing a study and discussion session on the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. They were discussing passionately, which immediately drew us in.

Party branch secretary Yu Shaohai was sharing his thoughts: “I think the decisions made by the Central Committee’s plenary session are excellent! In the past, when I talked about following the socialist path and upholding party principles, some people would say I was outdated and out of touch with the times. I just couldn’t understand it! Now I realize that the general secretary of the Central Committee had incorrect ideas.”

Old party member Han Qinglai stood up abruptly, his voice booming like thunder: “A few days ago, I heard on the radio and saw on TV that people in Beijing were shouting slogans to overthrow the Communist Party. How dare they! They’re trying to turn everything upside down! Tell me, without the Communist Party, could we have what we have today? In Huixi Village, what was life like ten years ago, and what is it like now? Everyone knows. We can’t forget the tree that bore the fruit! With a population of 1.1 billion, the country is complex and difficult to manage. Who else but the Communist Party can lead it?”

Female party member Xia Junying, who had been silent until now, opened her mouth: “Some bad elements want to overthrow the Communist Party and create chaos nationwide. That’s too reactionary! Look at those bad elements, attacking the military, gouging out eyes, hanging corpses, and burning them. They’re even more vicious than the Japanese devils from the past! We must strike them down! We all know about the ten years of turmoil during the Cultural Revolution. If things continue to get chaotic, we won’t be able to live good lives! For example, in a family, if everyone is constantly arguing, can they live together?”

The middle-aged party member Luo Jindian took off his glasses and began to speak slowly: “I’ve been thinking, what lessons can we learn from this turmoil? I think that in recent years, the country hasn’t emphasized class struggle, and ideological and political work has been relaxed. Now it seems that as long as you have money, you’re a good person, and doing a hundred good deeds is useless!”

Young party member Zheng Huashan said: “There are many lessons to be learned, but I think that party members not only need to summarize the lessons verbally but more importantly, we need to make up for the losses! The most urgent task now is to lead the masses to boost production!”

“Right!” everyone said in unison: “Produce more grain and cotton, develop the economy, and frustrate those bad elements!”

The discussion became more heated. Ah! What great Communist Party members! With them and the new Central Committee leadership, what do we have to fear?

    “四中全会开在咱心坎上”
    “七一”前夕，我们来到江苏省东台市广山乡胡西村。这个村党支部正在组织党员学习讨论中央十三届四中全会公报，他们谈得热火朝天，一下子就把我们吸引住了。
    党支部书记余韶海正在谈他的体会：“我看中央全会作出的决定太好了！过去我讲走社会主义道路，讲党的原则，就有人说思想老化，跟不上形势。我就想不通！现在才明白，原来中央的总书记思想观念就不端正。”老党员韩庆来“霍”地站起身，声音像打雷似的：“前些日子，我听广播，看电视，北京竟有人呼口号，要打倒共产党。这还了得，简直要翻天了！你说，要不是共产党，能有我们今天吗？我们胡西村，十年前是什么日子，现在是什么日子，大家都清清楚楚，我们不能吃了果子忘了树！十一亿人口的大国，复杂难搞，除了共产党还会有谁领导得下去？”一直没有开口的女党员夏俊英也打开了话匣：“一些坏家伙为了要打倒共产党，想把全国搞乱。太反动了！你看那帮坏家伙打解放军，挖眼珠子，吊尸体烧，简直比过去的日本鬼子还毒！不狠狠打击得了吗？文化大革命十年动乱，我们都知道的，再乱下去，我们就别想过好日子了！比如一个家庭，一家大小天天吵架，还能过日子吗？”坐在一旁看公报的中年党员罗金淦拿下老花眼镜，慢条斯理地讲开了：“我一直在想，这次动乱，教训在哪里？我看啦，这几年国家好像也不提阶级斗争了，思想政治工作放松了，现在是只要抓到钱就是好人，做一百桩好事也没用！”青年党员郑华山说：“教训多的是，但我觉得，我们党员不但要在口头上总结教训，更重要的还是要夺回损失！当前最要紧的是带动群众把生产搞上去！”“对！”大家异口同声地说：“多打粮棉，繁荣经济，气死那些坏蛋！”……
    讨论会越开越热烈。啊！多好的共产党员！有他们在，有新的党中央领导集体来领导，咱们还怕什么呢？　（仇家石）
