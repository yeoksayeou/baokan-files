Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Wang Bingqian recently stressed at the National Fiscal Work Conference that the propositions of "deficit is harmless" and "inflation is beneficial" do not apply to China. China's fiscal work must start from China's national conditions and national strength, adhering to the principle of balancing revenue and expenditure according to capacity.

Wang Bingqian said that in the past 10 years, the state budget had only one year of surplus, while the remaining 9 years had deficits. Of course, in the years when these deficits occurred, some were necessary costs paid for economic adjustment and economic reform, and were unavoidable. But some were due to certain mistakes in macro-decision-making and errors in guiding ideology. Wang Bingqian pointed out that in recent years, some people have proposed that in the initial stage of China's economic take-off, we can follow the practices of Western countries, using fiscal deficits and inflation to stimulate economic development. The facts have proven that such propositions do not apply to China.

Wang Bingqian pointed out that China is a developing socialist country. The main problem at present is commodity shortage, with total social demand exceeding total supply. Therefore, fiscal deficits and inflation can only exacerbate the contradiction between total supply and total demand. Therefore, China's state budget must start from China's actual situation, adhering to the principle of balancing revenue and expenditure according to capacity.

Wang Bingqian emphasized that at present, China's fiscal work is facing serious difficulties. This is the accumulated result of many years of excessive distribution of national income, the manifestation of economic overheating, total supply-demand imbalance, and some mistakes in economic work. The problems in the economy are not solved, and fiscal deficits will be difficult to eliminate in the short term. However, fiscal work must adhere to the effort and development from unbalanced revenue and expenditure to balanced revenue and expenditure. In the future, national production must maintain a reasonable and moderate growth rate on the basis of improving efficiency, and it cannot be too high; basic construction must maintain an appropriate scale on the basis of improving the investment structure, and it cannot be too large; people's lives can only be gradually improved with the development of production, and it cannot be too fast.

Wang Bingqian also proposed that in recent years, due to the excessive dispersion of financial resources, the macro-control ability of the state finance, especially the central finance, has weakened, which has had an adverse impact on the reform and opening up and production construction. Therefore, he stressed that it is necessary to appropriately increase the proportion of fiscal revenue in national income and the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue. In addition, fiscal levers such as taxation, subsidies, and public bonds should be used to guide and regulate micro-economic activities, and to alleviate the problem of unfair social distribution, so as to ensure that various economic activities develop healthily.

    王丙乾谈财政工作方针
    坚持量力而行收支平衡
    “赤字无害论”“通货膨胀有益论”在中国行不通
    新华社北京7月14日电  （记者丁坚铭）国务委员兼财政部部长王丙乾日前在全国财政工作会议上强调，“赤字无害论”和“通货膨胀有益论”的主张在中国是行不通的，中国的财政工作必须从中国国情和国力出发，坚持量力而行、收支平衡的方针。
    王丙乾说，在过去的10年中，国家财政仅有1年是结余的，其余9年都出现了赤字。当然在出现这些赤字的年度中，有些是为经济调整和经济改革而付出的必要代价，是不得已的。但有些则是由于宏观决策上的某些失误和指导思想上的错误造成的。王丙乾指出，最近几年，有人提出在中国经济起飞初期，可以仿效西方国家的做法，用财政赤字和通货膨胀来刺激经济的发展。事实证明，这种主张在中国行不通。
    王丙乾指出，中国是发展中的社会主义国家，中国当前的主要问题是商品短缺，社会需求总量超过总供给，因而财政赤字、通货膨胀只能加剧社会总供给与总需求的矛盾。因此，中国的国家预算必须从中国实情出发，坚持量力而行、收支平衡的原则。
    王丙乾强调，目前我国的财政正面临严重的困难，这是多年来国民收入超分配积累下来的恶果，是经济过热，总供需失衡以及经济工作中的一些失误在财政上的体现。经济上的问题不解决，财政赤字一时也很难消除，但财政工作必须坚持由收支不平衡逐步朝收支平衡的方向努力和发展。今后，国民生产要在提高效益的基础上保持合理的适度的增长速度，不能过高；基本建设要在改善投资结构的基础上保持适当规模，不能过大；人民生活也只能随着生产发展而逐步改善，决不能过快。
    王丙乾还提出，这几年由于财力过于分散，国家财政特别是中央财政的宏观调控能力减弱，这给改革开放和生产建设事业带来了不利影响。为此他强调，必须适当提高财政收入占国民收入的比重，提高中央财政收入占国家财政收入的比重。此外要运用税收、补贴、公债等财政杠杆，引导和调节微观经济活动，并缓解社会分配不公的问题，做到管而不死，活而不乱，以保证国民经济各项活动得到健康发展。
