Jinan municipal leaders have established multiple channels to connect with the masses, including regular visits to the grassroots, thematic investigations, setting up a mayor's hotline, and establishing contact bases. These methods have become four important channels for the Jinan Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government to frequently communicate with the people.

Since 1985, the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government have organized one to two city-wide visits to the grassroots each year, and this has been maintained as a regular practice for five years. During this year's Spring Festival, they focused on issues related to enterprise production and people's livelihood. They organized nearly 10,000 officials from municipal, county, district, and township levels into 642 teams to conduct in-depth investigations. They collected over 4,000 opinions, suggestions, and requests, of which 63% were resolved on the spot. The remaining issues were addressed by relevant departments and have been basically resolved.

The Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government also pay great attention to conducting investigations and research around specific themes to guide work on the ground. Mayor Zhai Yongbo, in response to the severe situation of urban vegetable and sideline product supply, led relevant department heads to visit suburban towns and mobilize the masses to strengthen the construction of sideline product bases, achieving noticeable results. Especially since June, the city's fresh vegetable supply has shown a positive trend with sufficient quantities, diverse varieties, good quality, and stable prices with a downward trend. Statistics show that the vegetable price index in the urban area in June was 20.3% lower than the same period last year.

To open up a smooth channel for party and government leaders to understand the masses' information at any time, the Jinan Municipal Government established the Mayor's Hotline on January 25, 1988. In the past year and a half, they have handled over 16,900 calls from the masses, with 96% of them resolved. To promptly respond to representative opinions from the masses, they also opened a "Mayor's Hotline" column in the "Jinan Daily." As of now, 58 issues have been published with over 160 articles.

To facilitate the guidance of overall work, the Municipal Party Committee's standing committee members and mayors have each established fixed contact bases in one or two units. Since the beginning of this year, Municipal Party Committee Secretary He Guoqiang has taken the First Jinan Cotton Mill as his contact point, frequently visiting the mill to conduct investigations and research, and helping to solve practical problems. Seeing that the mill's party committee focuses on party building and ideological and political work, effectively playing the party's role in the enterprise, he summarized and promoted their experiences, driving the party building work and ideological and political work across the city.

    济南市领导联系群众渠道多
    定期沉底　专项调查　设市长电话　建联系基地
    本报济南电　记者贾建舟报道：定期“沉底”体察下情、围绕专题开展调研、公开设置市长电话、普遍建立联系基点，已经成为济南市委、市政府经常沟通与人民群众关系的4条重要渠道。
    自1985年开始，市委、市政府每年都要开展一至两次全市性的体察下情活动，并作为一项制度坚持了5年之久。今年春节期间，他们针对企业生产和群众生活所存在的问题，组织市县区局以及乡镇近万名干部，分成642个小组，深入调查，共征集各种意见、建议和要求4000多条，其中当场解决的占63％，其余的也由有关部门列入计划，基本上都得到了解决。
    市委、市政府还十分重视围绕一些专题开展调查研究，指导面上的工作。市长翟永波针对城市蔬菜、副食品供应形势严峻的问题，带领有关部门负责同志深入郊区乡镇发动群众加强副食品基地建设，收到了明显成效。特别是进入6月份以来，全市鲜菜供应出现了数量足、品种多、质量好、价格稳中有降的好势头。据统计，6月份市区蔬菜价格指数比去年同期下降20.3％。
    为开辟党政领导随时了解群众信息的畅通沟道，济南市政府于1988年1月25日正式建立了市长公开电话。一年半来，共受理群众电话1.69万多次，已处理的占96％。为及时答复有代表性的群众意见，他们还在《济南日报》开辟了“市长公开电话”专栏，截至目前已刊出58期，发稿160多篇。
    为了便于指导全面工作，市委常委和正副市长分别确定一至两个单位建立了固定的联系基地。市委书记贺国强自今年初把济南第一国棉厂作为自己的联系点后，经常进厂调查研究，帮助解决实际问题。他看到该厂党委以主要精力抓好党的建设和思想政治工作，较好地发挥了党在企业中的作用，就总结推广他们的经验，推动了全市党的建设工作和思想政治工作。
