Xinhua News Agency, Macau, July 2nd.

Macau's Secretary for Works and Housing, Jia Bo Le, pointed out that there are currently no signs indicating that Macau's overall economic development is slowing down. Macau will continue to develop at the pace of recent years in a peaceful and stable environment.

This was stated by Jia Bo Le yesterday during a ceremony when he analyzed the impact of the Beijing events on Macau. He noted that the recent events in China had caused some concern about Macau's future. However, there are no signs that the conditions for Macau's overall economic development will worsen, slow down, or come to a halt. Currently, the construction industry remains one of Macau's best economic indicators, and there are no plans to reduce related development plans in the future.

He emphasized that the governments of China and Portugal have recently reaffirmed their full adherence to the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration, ensuring their commitments to the region.

    贾伯乐谈经济前景时认为
    澳门整体发展不会放慢
    新华社澳门7月2日电  澳门政府工务暨房屋政务司贾伯乐指出，目前没有迹象显示本澳整体经济发展放缓，澳门将在和平安定的气氛下，以近年来的速度继续发展。
    这是贾伯乐昨天在一个仪式上致词时分析北京事件对澳门的影响所说的。他指出，最近在中国发生的事件，曾经使人们对澳门的前景产生忧虑。但是没有迹象显示，澳门整体经济发展的条件会变得较差、放缓甚至停顿。目前，建筑业仍是本澳较佳的经济指标，今后亦不会削减有关发展计划。
    他强调说，中葡两国政府最近已重申完全遵守中葡联合声明，保证对本地区的承诺。
