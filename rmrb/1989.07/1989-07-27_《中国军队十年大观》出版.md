The large-scale photo album "The Great View of the Chinese Army in the Past Ten Years" was published by Sichuan Fine Arts Publishing House and has been released just before the "August 1st" anniversary.

The album realistically and artistically recreates the major events in the history of our army from 1979 to 1988, showcasing the great achievements made in combat, construction, and reform over the past decade.

The author of the album is the familiar military photographer Qiao Tianfu. Over the past ten years, he has persisted in capturing the essence of the people's army. The album's style is to depict the heroic deeds of soldiers, express their lofty aspirations, and highlight their masculine beauty.
