The life of soldiers in the desert is very monotonous and dull. If you haven't experienced it firsthand, it's hard to understand its hardships. However, if you ask in detail any officer or soldier from the unit where Yang Yang served, their descriptions will surely straighten out the question marks in your mind.

In 1985, this unit moved from the ancient city of Xi'an to the edge of the Tengger Desert. Besides regular military training, they also tried to enrich their cultural life. Here is an interesting story.

One Sunday, a few veteran soldiers who had enlisted from the banks of the Ba River went to the desert to relax and entertain themselves. Looking up, they saw a few birds flying in the sky, which inspired them to think of raising pigeons.

Back at the camp, they shared their idea with the leadership, and surprisingly, they received support. Thus, they wrote letters to soldiers on leave to bring pigeons and asked those on business trips to Lanzhou and Xi'an to buy pigeons. In just a few years, the number of pigeons in this unit grew from none to over 400.

I heard that the political instructor of the Anti-Aircraft Gun Company, Fan Ruijie, is the secretary of the Gansu Pigeon Association, so he must be knowledgeable. I decided to interview him.

Unfortunately, he was out on business for a few days. In the company, I chatted with the communication soldier Sun Weiya. To my surprise, he was also an expert in raising pigeons. This soldier from Xinxiang, Henan, who had enlisted the previous year, along with a few friends, raised over 50 pigeons. Sun was quite open and didn't show any shyness typical of a new soldier. He told me that when he first came to the Tengger Desert, he found it a bit hard to adapt and couldn't bear the loneliness. Seeing others raise pigeons, he decided to raise a few pairs himself. It's strange, but after raising pigeons, he no longer felt empty after training. On Sundays, we would get up early, pack some food, and go deep into the desert to release the pigeons. Watching the freely flying pigeons and listening to their clear, pleasant cooing, our hearts were almost intoxicated. We felt a sense of satisfaction and our spirits were greatly uplifted. I never expected him to say so much with such profound meaning.

Not only do the soldiers in this unit raise pigeons, but the officers in the battalion and the leaders in the regiment also raise pigeons. The political instructor of the Artillery Battalion, Zheng Lianlian, raised nearly a hundred pigeons by himself and is also the vice-chairman of the Gansu Pigeon Association. He has a lot of experience in training pigeons and is quite famous among pigeon enthusiasts in Gansu. In the spring of 1987, in the 1000-kilometer pigeon race from Xi'an to Huairou County, Beijing, organized by the Gansu Pigeon Association, his pigeon "Raindrop" won fourth place. Last year, in the Jingtai-Shandan pigeon race, his pigeon "Raindrop" won first place, receiving praise from his peers.

At the beginning of this year, the regiment leaders, to support the soldiers in raising pigeons, decided to invest 5,000 yuan to make a batch of high-quality pigeon cages for everyone. The soldiers were overjoyed and unanimously approved.

Yes, military life in the desert is lonely and monotonous, but the pigeons flying and circling in the sky above the camp, along with their cooing, have added joy to the soldiers' lives and brought vitality to the camp.

These beautiful pigeons are indeed the soldiers' pursuit of their ideals in life!

    大漠鸽哨
    杨战宏
    大漠里的士兵，生活是很枯燥单调的。倘若你不身临其境，很难体会它的艰苦性。然而，当你真正详细询问一下欧阳海生前所在团无论哪个干部战士，他们的描绘定会把你头脑里的问号拉得直直的。
    1985年，这个团从古城西安移防来到腾格里沙漠边沿。他们除了正常的军事训练以外，还想办法丰富业余文化生活。这里讲的是一个有趣的故事。
    一个星期天，几个从灞河岸边入伍的老战士到大漠里解闷散心，抬头望见天空中飞过几只鸟雀，于是触景生情，想出了养鸽子的点子。
    回到军营，他们把想法告诉了领导，没想到竟然得到了支持。于是，他们写信让探亲的战友带鸽子，让出差到兰州、西安的战友买鸽子。短短几年时间，这个团的鸽子从无到有，由少到多，目前竟然发展到了400只之多。
    听说高射机枪连指导员范瑞杰是甘肃省信鸽协会秘书长，想必他肯定是个知情人，我便打定了采访他的主意。
    真不凑巧，他这几天外出办事去了。在连部，我便找通信员孙维亚聊天，没想到他也竟是个养鸽子能手。这个去年才入伍的河南信阳新兵，和几个好友一下子养了50多只鸽子。小孙人挺痛快，谈话时没有一点新兵的羞涩。他告诉我，刚一来到腾格里沙漠，真还有点不习惯，忍受不住这种寂寞。因为看着别人养鸽子，于是自己就养了几对。说来也怪，以前训练搞完后，总觉得心里空荡荡的，打从养了鸽子后，就没有这种感觉了。星期天我们起得早早的，背上干粮，到大漠深处去放鸽子。望着自由飞翔的鸽子，听着那清脆悦耳的鸽哨声，我们的心几乎都要醉了，感到了一种满足，同时也觉得精神充实了许多。真没想到，他竟然一下子说出了这么多寓意不浅的话。
    这个团不仅连队干部战士养鸽子，而且营里干部、团里领导也养鸽子。炮兵营教导员郑炼炼一个人竟养了近百只鸽子，而且还是甘肃省信鸽协会副主席呢。他训养鸽子很有点经验，不仅在全团，就是在甘肃省鸽子迷中间也颇有点名气。1987年春天，在甘肃省信鸽协会组织的西安——北京怀柔县空距1000公里信鸽放飞比赛中，他的信鸽“雨点”获得了第四名。去年，在景泰——山丹信鸽放飞比赛中，他的信鸽“雨点”又一举夺魁，受到了同行们的称赞。
    今年初，团里领导为了支持战士们养鸽子，决定投资5000元，为大伙做一批质量较好的鸽子笼。战士们听到这消息喜上眉梢，无不拍手称好。
    是的，大漠里的军旅生活是孤寂而单调的，然而，军营上空飞翔盘旋的鸽群以及那声声鸽哨，却给战士们的生活增添了乐趣，给军营带来了活力。
    这美丽的鸽子不正是士兵对人生理想的追求吗！
