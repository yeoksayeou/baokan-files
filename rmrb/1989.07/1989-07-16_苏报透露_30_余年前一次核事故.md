    Soviet newspapers have revealed details of a nuclear accident that occurred in the 1950s in the Chelyabinsk region of southern Ural.

    *Komsomolskaya Pravda* reported today that after World War II, the Soviet Union established a facility in the Chelyabinsk region to produce plutonium, the material used in nuclear weapons. The industrial reactor began operation in 1948, and one year later, the first Soviet atomic bomb was produced. To process the fuel for the reactor, a radiochemical plant was also built there. In September 1957, an explosion occurred in the chemical waste, damaging the containers storing radioactive elements, creating a 105-kilometer-long and 8-9-kilometer-wide radioactive belt with a radiation level of 20 million curies. At that time, 10,000 people were relocated from the contaminated area, and another 7,000 people were relocated from the Techa River region. Overcoming the consequences of the accident cost 200 million rubles.

    Western media reported on this accident at the time, but the Soviet Union has remained silent about it for over 30 years.

    苏报透露30余年前一次核事故
    新华社莫斯科7月15日电　苏联报刊披露了50年代南乌拉尔车里雅宾斯克州发生的核事故情况。
    《共青团真理报》今天报道，二次大战后，苏联在车里雅宾斯克州建立起生产核武器的原料钚的企业。1948年工业反应堆开始投产，一年后制成了苏联的第一枚原子弹。为了加工反应堆的燃料，又在这里建立了放射化学工厂。1957年9月化学废料发生爆炸，储存放射元素的容器遭到破坏，形成了长105公里、宽8—9公里的放射带，放射量为200万居里。当时有1万人从污染地区迁走，另有7000人从捷奇河地区迁走。为了克服事故造成的后果耗费了2亿卢布。
    这一事故西方新闻媒介当年曾作了报道，而苏联30多年来一直对此沉默。
