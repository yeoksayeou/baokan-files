The United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Namibia, Martti Ahtisaari, said on July 8 in Luanda that although there have always been some difficulties, the process of Namibia's independence is currently progressing smoothly.

Ahtisaari made the above statement after being received by Angolan President José Eduardo dos Santos. He was invited to attend the 4th meeting of the Angola, Cuba, and South Africa Joint Commission held in Luanda on July 7 and 8.

Ahtisaari expressed the hope that Namibia's elections could be held as scheduled on November 6.

When asked whether members of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) in Namibia are being persecuted by South African troops, Ahtisaari said that the situation is somewhat difficult for those who previously lived abroad, but he does not believe there is a special campaign against anyone.

According to Angolan sources, Angola and Cuba expressed concern at the Angola, Cuba, South Africa Joint Commission meeting about the situation in northern Namibia, particularly the intimidation by the police. It is reported that over 100 Namibians have recently crossed the border into Angola.

    联合国秘书长特别代表说
    纳独立进程进展顺利
    新华社罗安达7月9日电  联合国秘书长驻纳米比亚特别代表马尔蒂·阿赫蒂萨里8日在罗安达表示，虽然始终存在一些困难，但纳米比亚独立进程目前进展顺利。
    阿赫蒂萨里是在安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯接见他之后向各国记者作上述表示的。他应邀参加了7日和8日在罗安达举行的第4次安哥拉、古巴和南非联合委员会会议。
    阿赫蒂萨里表示，希望纳米比亚大选能在11月6日如期举行。
    在被问到西南非洲人民组织成员是否在纳米比亚受到南非军人迫害时，阿赫蒂萨里表示，局势对以前居住在国外的人有些困难，但他不认为存在针对什么人的特别运动。
    据安哥拉人士说，安哥拉和古巴在安、古、南非联合委员会会议上对纳米比亚北部局势，尤其是警察的恐吓行为表示关切。据报道，已经有100多名纳米比亚人近日越过边界进入安哥拉。
