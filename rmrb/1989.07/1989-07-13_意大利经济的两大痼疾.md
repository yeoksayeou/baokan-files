Italy's economic development has its advantages and challenges. Facing intense international competition, Italy's small and medium-sized enterprises have been prosperous and enduring; many large enterprises are well-managed, with increasing profits. The inflation rate is controlled at around 5%, and the economy has been growing steadily for five years. Last year, it grew by 3.6% compared to the previous year, the highest in the past decade, dubbed Italy's "second takeoff," attracting the attention of European and American countries.

Currently, Italy's prominent economic challenges are its massive budget deficit and enormous national debt. Last year's budget deficit reached $89.8 billion, equivalent to 12% of the Gross Domestic Product, the highest among the seven major industrialized nations. The causes of the massive budget deficit are numerous, primarily the rising social welfare expenditures and national debt interest rates, which are difficult to control. The public medical system is poorly managed, inefficient, and wasteful. The government calls for reducing expenditures every year, but expenditures continue to increase. Additionally, the financial subsidies provided by the state to loss-making state-owned enterprises and state-participating enterprises are astonishing. The financial resources of the three-tier local governments (regions, provinces, and municipalities) are tight, and expenditures are increasing rapidly. 40% of local governments are facing budget deficits, and the central government is forced to make up the difference. "Budget deficit" has become a major topic in cabinet meetings. To cover the deficit, the Treasury Department frequently issues bonds with high interest rates to encourage citizens to purchase them. The types of bonds are numerous, with an average interest rate of over 10%, which is rare among major Western countries. By the end of the third quarter last year, the cumulative national debt had reached 1010 trillion lire, which, if calculated at a rate of 1 USD = 1300 lire, amounts to $77.69 billion, equivalent to 94.5% of Italy's annual national income. Compared to the average of the seven major industrialized nations, this is 40.2% higher. High national debt and high interest rates mean that the government's annual expenditure on national debt interest constitutes nearly 80% of the budget deficit. The budget deficit increases year by year, and measures to increase revenue and reduce expenditures are difficult to implement. The government can only issue new bonds to cover the deficit, creating a vicious cycle that is hard to reverse.

For many years, the government, parliament, parties, and labor-management have had heated debates over the issues of the deficit and national debt. Sometimes, these debates even lead to government crises. The Republican Party, which has close ties with major financial groups, advocates for a significant reduction in social expenditures to find a way out. The Italian Communist Party, Socialist Party, and other left-wing parties, along with trade unions, strongly oppose this from the perspective of labor interests and electoral competition. The Liberal Party's main supporters are businessmen, lawyers, doctors, and other professionals. The party is afraid of losing the support of its voters and has always strongly opposed the government's measures to increase taxes on professionals, even threatening to withdraw from the government. Some economists believe that Italy can only truly get out of the quagmire of deficits and national debt through genuine tax reform. Deficits and national debt are not only severe economic problems for Italy but also factors that threaten social stability.

Due to the government's inability to shed the heavy burden of the budget deficit, the country's productive investments and research and development funds are always limited each year. The promotion of Italy's economic sustainable development relies mainly on enterprises' productive investments and research and development funds. However, enterprises, driven by their own interests, act independently. The government, though willing, is unable to coordinate nationwide efforts. Many far-sighted economists point out that if the Italian government cannot change the current situation in the short term, the country's economic development may face serious consequences due to a lack of momentum in the long run.

Looking ahead to the next few years, the situation facing Italy is severe. Some Italian economists believe that after the European Community implements capital freedom, a large-scale outflow of capital from Italy is inevitable. Currently, due to high interest rates and other factors, Italy is the country with the highest savings in the Western world. The government raises a large amount of funds from issuing bonds and massive savings, which to some extent alleviates and masks the severity of the deficit and national debt problems. It seems that year after year, things can still go on. However, countries like West Germany have lower bank interest rates, lower inflation rates, and higher banking service efficiency, making them more attractive. If the government's bonds lose their market, and bank savings decrease, there will be no sufficient funds to cover the budget deficit. Of course, at that time, the Italian government can also use the method of significantly raising interest rates to prevent capital outflow and stimulate citizens to continue purchasing bonds. But the consequence would be that borrowing at high prices to repay old debts, like a snowball, would grow larger and larger, even possibly reaching an uncontrollable level. The impact of the massive budget deficit and national debt on Italy is worth studying.

    意大利经济的两大痼疾
    水亭
    意大利的经济发展有它的优势和难处。面对激烈的国际竞争，意大利的中小企业生财有道，久盛而不衰；不少大企业经营有方，利润增加。通货膨胀率控制在5％左右，经济5年持续发展，去年又比前年增长3.6％，为最近10年来最高数，被称为意大利经济的“第二次腾飞”，已引起欧美国家的注视。
    当前意大利经济突出的难处是庞大的预算赤字和巨额国债。去年的预算赤字高达898亿美元，相当于国内生产总值的12％，居西方七大工业国之首。造成巨额预算赤字的原因很多，主要是社会福利开支和国债利息水涨船高，难以控制。公费医疗制经营不善，效率低、浪费大，政府年年呼喊削减开支，却年年有增无减。此外，国家给亏损的国营企业和国家参与企业的财政补贴也很惊人，大区、省、市镇三级地方政府的财源紧张、开支急增，40％的地方政府出现预算赤字，中央政府被迫贴补。“预算赤字”成了内阁会议一大中心议题。为弥补赤字，国库部频频发行债券，以高利率刺激公民争购。债券名目繁多，平均利率高达10％以上，这在西方主要国家中实为少见。到去年第三季度末，累计国债已达1010万亿里拉，如按一美元等于1300里拉计算，合7769亿美元，相当于意大利一年国民生产总值的94.5％，同西方七个工业国平均数相比，竟高出40.2％。高国债，高利率，政府每年支付的国债利息，构成了近80％的预算赤字。预算赤字年年增加，增收节支措施又难以采取，政府只得发行新债券弥补赤字，造成难以逆转的恶性循环。
    多年来，政府、议会、党派、劳资之间围绕赤字和国债问题争论激烈。有时甚至酿成政府危机。同大财团关系较为密切的共和党主张大幅度削减社会开支，从节流中寻找出路。意共、社会党等左翼党派和工会从劳动者利益与争夺选票出发，竭力反对。自由党的基本选民是商人、律师、医生等自由职业者，该党害怕失去选民的支持，对政府增加自由职业者税收的措施一直表示强烈不满，甚至以退出政府相威胁。一些经济专家认为意大利只有真正推行税收改革，才能从赤字与国债的泥潭中摆脱出来。赤字与国债不仅是意大利的严峻经济问题，而且成了影响社会安定的不稳定因素。
    由于政府难以丢掉预算赤字的沉重包袱，每年国家的生产性投资和科研开发费总是有限。促进意大利经济持续发展的生产性投资和科研开发费主要来自企业。但是，企业为了自身利益，各自为政。政府心有余力不足，难以搞全国一盘棋。许多有远见的经济学家指出，如意大利政府在短期内不能改变现状，久而久之，国家的经济发展将可能因缺乏后劲而产生严重后果。
    展望今后几年，摆在意大利面前的形势是严峻的。意大利一些经济学家认为欧洲共同体内部资本自由流通后，意大利大量资本外流难以避免。当前，由于高利率等因素，意大利是西方世界储蓄额最高的国家。政府从发行债券和巨额储蓄金中大量集资，在一定程度上缓解和掩盖了赤字与国债问题的严重性。好像年复一年，还过得去。但是，西德等国银行利率虽低，通膨率却更低，且银行服务效率高，具有更大的吸引力。意政府兜售的债券一旦失去市场，银行储蓄减少，就找不到足够资金弥补预算赤字。当然，届时意政府也可用大幅度提高利率的办法来防止资本外流，刺激公民继续购买债券。但后果将是，高价借新债，借了新债还旧债，像滚雪球一样，越滚越大，甚至可能达到失控的地步。巨额预算赤字和国债对意大利的影响值得研究。
