The wheel of Afghan national reconciliation has begun to turn. In February, after the complete withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, various parties involved had discussed how to resolve the Afghan issue through political means. At that time, the Soviet Union, Pakistan, Iran, and the Kabul regime; the Soviet Union and the seven-party and eight-party alliances of the resistance forces; Pakistan and Iran; the seven-party and eight-party alliances; and even the Soviet Union and the United States had held negotiations or consultations, attempting to find a path to Afghan national reconciliation. However, with the establishment of the interim government of the seven-party alliance and, in particular, the outbreak of the Battle of Jalalabad on March 6, the process of national reconciliation was stalled.

The Battle of Jalalabad has been protracted, with heavy casualties on both sides and no clear winner, leading the relevant parties to realize that the Afghan issue must be resolved politically, as military means cannot solve the problem. In early June, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's visit to the United States marked the beginning of the Afghan national reconciliation process. Subsequently, several plans and proposals emerged.

The Plan for a Neutral Expert Cabinet: This plan advocates for a comprehensive ceasefire, with the help of the United Nations, forming a "caretaker government" composed of neutral individuals, tribal representatives, and some civil servants from the current Kabul government to transfer power to a new government with a broader base. This plan was not initially proposed by Pakistan. During the signing of the Geneva Accords last year, the then UN special envoy Diego Cordovez had proposed a similar plan. This time, during Bhutto's visit to the United States, she discussed this plan with the UN Secretary-General and suggested that the United Nations propose it, with Pakistan's support. However, Bhutto insisted on two points: first, Najibullah must step down, and second, power should be transferred to the expanded interim government of the Afghan seven-party alliance. Some hardline leaders within the seven-party alliance oppose this plan, believing that the key issue is not the replacement of individual leaders but the entire system. If this plan is implemented, it might "impose a regime on the Afghan people." It is reported that the relevant parties have informed the United States and the Soviet Union about this plan, but both countries have not made public statements. Observers believe that the two countries will definitely have differences on the issue of transferring power to which government.

The Arafat Plan: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat flew from Moscow to Islamabad on June 24 for a short visit to Pakistan. During his stay, he met with the Pakistani president, prime minister, and leaders of the Afghan seven-party alliance. In his speech to the Pakistani parliament, he stated that he had brought a plan to peacefully resolve the Afghan issue and was willing to act as a mediator. His peace plan has three steps: first, the conflicting parties hold talks to achieve a comprehensive ceasefire, with the United States and the Soviet Union simultaneously stopping military aid; then, under the supervision of the United Nations, hold national elections, with all Afghan parties participating equally based on the population they control; and based on the election results, form a government with representatives from all political factions. Arafat said that before coming to Pakistan, he had "in-depth discussions" with Soviet leaders about this plan, indicating that the Soviet Union and Kabul agreed to this plan. Arafat's envoy to Kabul has announced that Najibullah "accepts all proposals" and welcomes them enthusiastically. Whether the Arafat plan can be implemented depends on the attitudes of the Afghan Mujahideen, Pakistan, and the United States.

On July 2, the U.S. envoy to the Afghan seven-party alliance interim government, Ambassador Thomson, said: "In the past, the Palestine Liberation Organization has consistently supported the Soviet Union and Najibullah on the Afghan issue, so I find it difficult to say he is an impartial mediator." Hardline leaders among the Mujahideen also stated that they would absolutely not engage in direct or indirect negotiations with the Najibullah regime. The Pakistani side has not yet made a public statement.

Despite the difficulties, the wheel of Afghan national reconciliation has indeed begun to turn. Although the above plans have not yet gained unanimous agreement from all parties, the need for a peaceful resolution to the Afghan issue has increasingly been acknowledged by the relevant parties. With specific plans in place, there is a basis for negotiations and consultations among all parties.

    阿富汗民族和解车轮开始转动
    本报记者　任毓骏
    今年2月苏军完全撤出阿富汗前后，有关各方曾酝酿过如何通过政治手段解决阿富汗问题。当时，苏联与巴基斯坦、伊朗以及喀布尔政权；苏联与抵抗力量的七党联盟和八党联盟；巴基斯坦和伊朗；七党联盟和八党联盟；甚至苏美之间都举行过谈判或磋商，试图找到阿富汗民族和解的途径。但随着七党联盟临时政府成立，特别是3月6日贾拉拉巴德之战爆发，民族和解的进程搁浅了。
    贾城之战旷日持久，双方伤亡惨重，且又难分胜负，使得有关方面认识到，阿富汗问题还是要走政治解决的路子，靠军事手段不能解决问题。6月上旬巴基斯坦总理贝·布托的美国之行，标志着阿富汗民族和解的车轮开始启动。此后便出现了几个方案与建议。
    成立中立专家内阁方案　这一方案主张首先全面停火，在联合国帮助下，由中立人士、部落代表以及喀布尔现政府的部分文官组成一个“看守政府”，向未来基础广泛的新政府移交权力。这一方案并非巴基斯坦首先提出，去年签署日内瓦协议时，当时的联合国特使科多韦斯就曾提出类似计划。这一次贝·布托访美时，同联合国秘书长讨论了这一方案，并建议由联合国提出，巴基斯坦给予支持。但贝·布托还坚持两点，一是纳吉布拉必须下台，二是权力应移交给经过扩充的阿富汗七党联盟临时政府。七党联盟中的一些强硬派领导人反对这一方案，他们认为，问题的关键不在于更换个别领导人，而在于整个制度，如实施这一计划，很可能“把一个政权强加给阿富汗民族”。据悉，有关方面已把这一方案通知美国和苏联，但两国都未公开表态。有观察家认为，两国在把权力移交给什么样的政府问题上，肯定是有分歧的。
    阿拉法特计划　巴勒斯坦领导人阿拉法特6月24日从莫斯科飞来伊斯兰堡，对巴基斯坦作了暂短访问。其间，他会见了巴基斯坦总统、总理以及阿富汗七党联盟领导人。他在巴基斯坦议会发表演讲时表示，他带来了一个和平解决阿富汗问题的计划，并愿意作调停人。他的和平计划分三步：首先，冲突双方举行谈判，实现全面停火，美苏两国同时停止军援；接着，在联合国监督下举行全国大选，阿富汗各方根据他们所控制的人口数量平等地参加选举；根据选举结果，组成有各派政治力量代表参加的政府。阿拉法特表示，他来巴之前已和苏联领导人“深入地讨论了这一计划”，这表明苏联和喀布尔同意这一计划。阿拉法特派往喀布尔的特使已宣布，纳吉布拉“接受所有建议”，并热烈欢迎。实现其阿拉法特计划是否行得通，关键要看阿富汗游击队、巴基斯坦和美国的态度。
    7月2日，美国最近派往阿富汗七党联盟临时政府的大使级特使汤姆森说：“过去，巴勒斯坦解放组织在阿富汗问题上一直支持苏联和纳吉布拉，所以我很难说他是一个不偏袒的调停者。”游击队领导人中的强硬派也表示，绝对不和纳吉布拉政权举行直接或间接谈判。巴基斯坦方面尚未公开表态。
    尽管困难重重，阿富汗民族和解的车轮毕竟已开始转动。
    上述方案虽然没有取得各方一致意见，但阿富汗问题必须和平解决这一点已越来越得到有关各方承认。有了具体的方案，就有了可供各方谈判和磋商的基础。
