Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 21st - (Reporter Wang Zhiyun) Leaders from a certain group army of the Jinan Military Region, along with representatives of war heroes and outstanding political work cadres, were recently invited to discuss with professors, scholars, political work cadres, and student leaders from Shandong University. Together, they explored effective strategies for cultivating individuals.

How should we view the difficulties in ideological and political work over the past few years? Everyone agreed that the key lies in whether one firmly believes in the power of ideological and political work. Renowned mathematician and university president Pan Chengdong said, "In recent years, the military has also faced many problems, but they have always guarded the ideological education front, firmly believing in the power of ideological and political work. Therefore, from top to bottom, they have bravely faced difficulties, making military ideological and political work effective, vibrant, and full of life despite the challenges."

During the discussion, both sides also explored the issue of political work cadres not being dedicated to their jobs. Everyone agreed that this problem should be addressed through institutional and policy measures. After the military representatives introduced their experiences in building a qualified, motivated, and capable team of political work cadres, Zhang Leying, the deputy secretary of the Shandong University Party Committee and vice president, said, "Shandong University currently has over 80 full-time and part-time counselors, and more than 140 Party Committee, Party Branch, and Party Cell members. In terms of personnel, we also have a strong lineup. If we can establish a system for selecting, training, and utilizing cadres like the military, the issue of political work cadres not being dedicated to their jobs can be effectively resolved, and their role can be fully utilized."

When discussing the principles and combativeness of ideological and political work, Shandong University members generally felt that the military's ideological and political work is clear-cut, unyielding, and uncompromising towards negative elements, which is very worthy of learning. They said, "In recent years, political work in universities has indeed been weak, even tolerating the spread of bourgeois liberalization views on the lecture platform. This lesson is worth remembering."

This discussion further deepened both sides' understanding of the importance of optimizing the micro-environment. Everyone said, "A unit with strong ideological and political work can minimize or avoid interference in the face of the spread of bourgeois liberalization ideologies."

### 山东大学邀某集团军座谈  师生官兵探讨育人良策

    山东大学邀某集团军座谈
    师生官兵探讨育人良策
    据新华社济南7月21日电  （记者王志耘）济南军区某集团军负责同志和战斗英雄、优秀政工干部代表，最近应邀与山东大学的教授、学者、政工干部和学生骨干进行座谈，共同探讨育人的良策。
    如何看待这几年思想政治工作难做的问题？大家一致认为，关键在于对思想政治工作的威力坚信不坚信。著名数学家、校长潘承洞说，这几年部队遇到的问题也很多，但他们始终坚守思想教育阵地，坚信思想政治工作的威力，所以从上到下都迎难而进，使部队思想政治工作在困难中做得富有成效，充满生机和活力。
    双方在座谈中还对政工干部不安心本职工作的问题进行了探讨。大家一致认为对这个问题要从制度、政策上入手加以解决。当部队同志介绍了建立一支合格的、想干的、会干的政工干部队伍的经验后，山东大学党委副书记兼副校长张乐岭说，山大现有专职和兼职的辅导员80多人，党委、党总支、党支部的干部也有140多人，从阵容上看也很可观。只要我们像部队那样形成一套选拔、培养、使用制度，政工干部不安心问题就可以得到有效解决，其作用是可以得到充分发挥的。
    在谈到思想政治工作的原则性和战斗性问题时，山大同志普遍感到部队思想政治工作旗帜鲜明，对消极东西不迁就，不迎合，是很值得学习的。他们说，这几年，高校的政治工作确有其软弱一面，甚至容忍在讲坛上散布资产阶级自由化的观点，教训很值得记取。
    这次座谈会使双方对优化小环境的重要性有了进一步的认识。大家说，一个单位思想政治工作坚强有力，就能在资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的情况下少受干扰或不受干扰。
