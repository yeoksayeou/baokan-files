    In the first half of this year, postal and telecommunications staff across the country overcame numerous difficulties and completed a total postal and telecommunications business volume of 30.6 billion yuan, with postal and telecommunications business income reaching 4.2 billion yuan. Both figures represent completing more than half of the tasks in half the time. Additionally, the profits realized by communication enterprises and the entire industry have seen significant increases compared to the same period last year.

    Ensuring smooth communication under any circumstances is the fundamental task of the postal and telecommunications sector. From mid-April to late June, during the struggle against turmoil and riots, postal and telecommunications staff remained at their posts, addressing the urgent communication needs of party and government leadership, martial law troops, public security, and other departments, and successfully completing communication tasks. The communication hubs of major cities were mostly in the heart of the turmoil, facing severe disruptions. Despite the challenges of interrupted or severely congested transportation, postal and telecommunications staff went to great lengths to ensure timely transportation and delivery of mail. In the first half of the year, the postal and telecommunications sector further improved its management responsibility system, leading to continued improvements in economic benefits.

    克服动乱暴乱干扰
    邮电实现时间过半完成任务过半
    本报讯  今年上半年，全国邮电干部职工克服重重困难，完成邮电业务总量30.6亿元，邮电业务收入42亿元，均实现时间过半完成任务过半。此外，通信企业的实现利润和全行业实现利润比去年同期有较大幅度增长。
    在任何情况下都要确保通信畅通，这是邮电部门的根本任务。4月中旬到6月上旬，在反对动乱和暴乱的斗争中，邮电干部职工坚守岗位，解决了党政领导机关、戒严部队和武警、公安等部门对通信的急需，圆满完成了通信任务。各大城市的通信枢纽，多数处在动乱的中心地带，受到严重干扰。在交通中断或严重阻塞的情况下，邮电干部职工千方百计保证及时运输和投递邮件。上半年，邮电部门进一步完善经营责任制，使经济效益继续提高。
