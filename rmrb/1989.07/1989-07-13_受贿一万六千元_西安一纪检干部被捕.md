Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 13th.

A disciplinary inspection official in Xi'an, Deng Zhiming, who accepted 16,000 yuan in bribes, was recently arrested by the Xincheng District People's Procuratorate of Xi'an.

According to the investigation, on June 25, 1988, two employees from a hotel and a department store in Xi'an approached Deng Zhiming, seeking his help to purchase a batch of 20-inch "Yellow River" brand color televisions. Seeing that they were acquaintances, Deng introduced them to the factory's sales department. After some negotiations, Deng and the sales department head jointly signed an agreement to sell 200 TVs at 2,229 yuan each. The two employees quickly sold these TVs in Xi'an, Shantou, and other places at prices of 2,500 yuan and 2,700 yuan per unit. Subsequently, Deng accepted 10,000 yuan in bribes from the two employees.

The investigation also revealed that Deng had similarly accepted 6,000 yuan in bribes from two units in Gansu and Henan the previous year.

    受贿一万六千元
    西安一纪检干部被捕
    新华社西安7月13日电  （记者姜文瑞、侯嘉荫）西安黄河机器制造厂党委纪检委委员、审计监察处处长邓志明接受贿赂1.6万元，前不久被西安市新城区人民检察院依法逮捕。
    据查，1988年6月25日，西安一家宾馆和商场的两名营业员，找到邓志明，请求帮忙，买一批20英寸“黄河”牌彩色电视机。邓志明见是熟人找上门，便将他们介绍给工厂的销售处。经过一番协商，由邓志明和销售处长共同签字，以每台2229元的价格批售给这两人200台彩电。两名营业员提货后，很快在西安、汕头等地，以每台2500元和2700元的价格将这批彩电销售出去。邓志明事后接受了这两名营业员1万元人民币的贿赂。
    经调查，邓志明还在去年以同样手段接受了甘肃、河南两个单位6000元的贿赂。
