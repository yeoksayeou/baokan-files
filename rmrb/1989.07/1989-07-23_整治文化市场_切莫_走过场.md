On July 19th, on the streets of Taiyuan, which had just been washed by a few showers, a middle-aged intellectual pointed to a bookstall and said to the reporter, "Our province has been rectifying the cultural market for more than ten days, but these bookstalls are still full of 'yellow' content. I sincerely hope that this rectification will not be like the rain that only blows away the dust from the yellow publications. That would be too disappointing."

In early July, the Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and the provincial government began to rectify and clean up the cultural market throughout the province. The focus was on cleaning up obscene, violent, and superstitious books and audio-visual materials, and inspecting and rectifying the operation of dance halls and other cultural entertainment activities. In just over ten days, a large number of obscene, violent, and superstitious publications were cleaned up from the bookstalls on the streets of Taiyuan.

However, after the inspection team left, the bookstalls on the streets of Taiyuan once again displayed obscene and superstitious publications that were hard to look at.

On July 19th, the reporter visited several dozen bookstalls in places such as Bingzhou Road, Wuyi Square, and the railway station in Taiyuan. The result was that almost every bookstall had publications with titles written in various colors and fonts that were enticing, such as "Yellow Women's Army," "Orgy of Lust," "Women's Market," "Great Orgy of Lust," and so on. The covers of the publications also featured almost naked men and women in various poses.

The reporter came to Wuyi Square and asked a few people who had just left the bookstalls for their opinions on the rectification of the cultural market. A woman leading a boy of about ten said, "It's about time. Otherwise, I wouldn't dare let my child browse the bookstalls, fearing he might buy bad books. Look, I had to come out with him." A young man added, "I don't know how they are rectifying it. As soon as the clean-up team leaves, the sellers bring out more bad books from somewhere. This time, the rectification of the cultural market must take effective measures and not just be a formality!"

The reporter also interviewed several other people, and they all hoped that the government would make a firm decision and take strong measures to rectify the cultural market, and not just go through the motions, and not disappoint people!

    整治文化市场  切莫“走过场”
    新华社记者　杜文峰
    七月十九日，在刚经过几阵风雨洗礼的太原街头，一位中年知识分子指着书摊对记者说：“咱省整顿文化市场十多天了，可这些书摊至今仍一片‘黄色’。我真诚希望这次整顿文化市场万万不可像几阵风雨过后那样，只是把黄色书刊上的尘土拂去。那样，就太令人失望了。”
    七月上旬，山西省委、省政府部署开始治理整顿全省的文化市场，重点对淫秽、凶杀、迷信的书刊、音像进行清理，对舞厅、舞会等文化娱乐的经营活动进行检查整顿。十多天来，仅在太原市的街头书摊上，就清理出大批黄色、凶杀、迷信等读物。
    但是，清理整顿检查组一过，太原街头书摊上又重新出现不堪入目的黄色、迷信书刊。
    七月十九日，记者在太原市并州路、五一广场、火车站等处看了几十个书摊，结果几乎每个书摊上都摆着封面上用各种颜色、各种字体书写的诱惑人的书名或篇名的书刊，如《黄色娘子军》、《淫窟肉搏战》、《女人市场》、《黄色大淫乱》等等。书刊的封面上，还印着几乎一丝不挂的女人或男人千姿百态的画像。
    记者来到五一广场，向几个刚离开书摊的人询问对整顿文化市场有什么看法。一位领着一个十多岁男孩的母亲说：“早该整了。不然，孩子上街逛书摊我也不放心，怕他买坏书。这不，我跟着孩子出来了。”一个小伙子接着说：“也不知是咋整顿的。你清理书摊的前脚刚走，那卖书的后脚就不知从哪儿弄来坏书又摆出来。这次整顿文化市场一定要采取有效措施，可别再是走过场了！”
    记者还采访了一些人，他们大都希望政府一定要下大决心，采取强有力的措施，整顿好文化市场，切莫走过场，切莫令人失望！
