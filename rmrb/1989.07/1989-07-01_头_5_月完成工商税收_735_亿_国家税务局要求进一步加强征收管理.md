    The first five months of this year saw the completion of 7.35 billion yuan in industrial and commercial tax revenue, a 15.7% increase over the same period last year, and 41.7% of the annual plan. This achievement comes despite economic challenges faced by some enterprises due to economic restructuring and tight monetary policy, which have led to reduced profits and lower payments of income and regulatory taxes.

    To increase fiscal revenue and promote stable economic development, the State Taxation Administration has called on local tax authorities to thoroughly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum. They are urged to further rectify tax order, plug loopholes, and use every means to boost production and increase revenue. The goal is to ensure the timely and full collection of due taxes and to exceed the annual tax collection target.

    Currently, special emphasis is being placed on strengthening the tax administration of personal income adjustment tax, individual industrial and commercial households, and private enterprises. This effort aims to alleviate the contradictions arising from income disparities among society's members.

    头5月完成工商税收735亿
    国家税务局要求进一步加强征收管理
    本报北京7月1日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：今年以来，由于调整经济结构，紧缩银根，一些企业经济效益差，上交所得税、调节税有所下降。在困难情况下，各级税务机关加强征收管理，大力组织收入，取得较好成绩。今年1月至5月，全国已经完成工商税收735亿元，比去年同期增长15.7％，完成了年计划的41.7％。
    为了增加财政收入，促进经济稳定发展，国家税务局要求各地税务机关认真贯彻四中全会精神，进一步整顿好税收秩序，堵塞漏洞，千方百计促产增收，把应收的税款及时足额收缴入库，确保完成全年税收任务，并力争多收。当前特别要加强对个人收入调节税、个体工商业户和私营企业的税收征管，以缓解社会成员之间分配不公的矛盾。
