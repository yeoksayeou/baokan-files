The Gezhouba Ship Lock Reopens for Vessel Passage

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 15th - (Correspondent Gui Huizhang) Due to the sudden rise in water levels from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, the Gezhouba Ship Lock was forced to close and suspend navigation. Today, it has officially reopened for vessel passage. Thus, the Yangtze River navigation, which had been interrupted for three days, has been fully restored.

With the gradual receding of the water from the upper reaches, by this morning, the inflow and outflow of the Gezhouba Reservoir both reached 58,000 cubic meters per second. This is a reduction of over 2,000 cubic meters per second compared to the flow rate at 22:00 yesterday, and the flow rate now meets the operational standards for the ship lock.

    葛洲坝船闸开闸过船
    新华社武汉7月15日电　（通讯员桂慧樵）受长江上游川水猛涨影响而被迫闭闸封航的葛洲坝船闸今天正式开闸过船。至此，中断3天的长江航运已经全线贯通。
    随着川水的逐渐回落，到今天上午，葛洲坝库区入库和下泄流量均在5.8万立方米／每秒，比昨天22时流量减少2000多立方米每秒，流量已经符合船闸的运行规则。
