Reporter Jing Xianfeng from Xian reports: With the approval of the Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a new entity that closely integrates research and production, the "Xian Aircraft Industrial Company," was recently established here.

The merging parties were originally the Ministry of Aeronautics and Astronautics' state-owned large-scale aircraft manufacturing plant and the aircraft design institute, which is renowned for its talent. Authoritative figures believe that, in terms of the nature of the integration of factories and design institutes, this is a high-level, long-term, and close integration.

    厂所合一的西飞公司成立
    本报西安电　记者景险峰报道：经航空航天工业部批准，一个由科研与生产单位紧密结合的新的实体——“西安飞机工业公司”，日前在此间宣告成立。
    联合的双方，原来分别是航空航天工业部所属的全民所有制的大型飞机制造厂家和人才荟萃的飞机设计所。权威人士认为，就厂所实行的结合性质而言，这是一种高层次、长久、紧密的结合。
