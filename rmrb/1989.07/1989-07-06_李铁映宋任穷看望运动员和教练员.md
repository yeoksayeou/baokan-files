New China News Agency, Beijing, July 5th – (Reporter Liang Jinxiong) Member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and State Councilor Li Tieming, and Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission Song Renqiong, visited the State Sports Commission Training Bureau this afternoon. They met with athletes and coaches from 13 different sports who are currently in training, and highly praised them for passing the political test during the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing in early June.

Li Tieming, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, expressed his greetings to the comrades on the sports front. He said that the sports front had shown a firm stance during this riot and had closely united around the Party Central Committee, showing excellent performance.

He pointed out that there are still 443 days until the Asian Games, and that the athletes and coaches should not only train hard but also achieve excellent results in the Asian Games to dispel international doubts about whether China can successfully host the Games.

Finally, Li Tieming put forward five requirements: 1. Persist in upholding the fine tradition of striving for national glory and daring to fight; 2. Learn from advanced foreign technologies; 3. Continuously summarize experiences and strictly manage the team; 4. Care for the athletes' physical and mental health and their cultural education; 5. Do not disappoint the Party and the country's expectations and strive for higher honors in the Asian Games next year.

Song Renqiong also praised the sports front for passing the political test during the riot. He encouraged everyone to train hard and strive for national glory.

Director of the Training Bureau Li Furong first introduced the team leaders, coaches, and athletes present. He then reported that the athletes and coaches under the Training Bureau had not interrupted their training during the riot and were striving to complete the task of winning about 60 gold medals in the Asian Games next year.

Minister of the State Sports Commission Wu Shaozu demanded that the athletes and coaches speak less and act more to repay the expectations of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the older generation of revolutionaries. Subsequently, Li Tieming and Song Renqiong, accompanied by the responsible persons of the State Sports Commission, observed and inquired about the training situation of the national women's volleyball team and other teams.
