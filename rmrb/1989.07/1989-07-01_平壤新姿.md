Pyongyang is both an ancient city rich in history and culture, and a vibrant, modern metropolis.

Recently, I revisited Pyongyang. On a misty afternoon, accompanied by enthusiastic hosts, I traversed familiar streets and arrived at Kwangbok Street, Chongnyu Street, and the May Day Stadium (formerly known as Ryongmun Island Stadium). I visited a group of newly constructed buildings, which are proudly referred to as "Pyongyang's pride."

As the car drove to the famous junction, I looked around and saw tall buildings lining both sides of the wide streets. The once potholed and overgrown landscape had completely disappeared. According to Kim Pyong-ho, the first deputy minister of the Construction Department and the chief commander of the Kwangbok Street construction project, the entire Kwangbok Street is 6 kilometers long and 100 meters wide, with an additional 100 meters of auxiliary roads. The total construction area is 5.5 million square meters, primarily consisting of residential buildings, totaling 25,000 units. In the 9 residential districts, there are shops, schools, kindergartens, nurseries, and parks. The residential buildings, some of which stand firmly on the ground and others that rise majestically, are painted in soft, pleasing colors that delight the eye. The harmonious and elegant environment is full of charm.

Adjacent to Kwangbok Street is Chongnyu Street, which offers a different scene. With one football field and nine indoor gymnasiums, it naturally earns the name "Sports Village." The total construction area of these 10 sports venues is 150,000 square meters, with a capacity to accommodate more than 50,000 spectators. These venues, with their excellent technical conditions, are fully equipped to simultaneously host 20 events and more than 40 types of international sports competitions. These sports venues were built to host the 13th World Youth Festival, and athletes from various countries will surely be delighted to find that this is an ideal venue to showcase their skills.

The May Day Stadium, located on Ryongmun Island in the Taedong River, is admired for its unique charm. The beautiful scenery of Ryongmun Island has inspired ancient Korean poets to leave behind famous lines such as "There are brocade mountains, and there is Ryongmun Island," which are still recited by later generations. Today, the May Day Stadium stands proudly among the green trees, adding a touch of grandeur to its beauty. According to the construction manager Kim Tae-ho, the entire stadium covers an area of 400,000 square meters, with a construction area of 207,000 square meters. It includes one main stadium for football and track and field events, one auxiliary stadium, and three training fields with natural grass, accommodating 150,000 spectators. This stadium, which cost over $200 million, was completed in just over two years from start to finish. Notably, the design of the main stadium's roof is both innovative and striking. It resembles both a fully inflated parachute and a lotus flower emerging from the water. This excellent design won a gold and silver medal at the Geneva International Invention and New Technology Expo last year.

    平壤新姿
    周必忠
    平壤既是一座古老的历史文化名城，又是一座青春焕发的现代化都市。
    不久前，我重访了平壤。一个烟雨迷蒙的下午，在热情的主人陪同下，我穿过往日熟识的街道，来到光复大街、青春大街、5·1体育场（原名绫罗岛体育场），参观近年来拔地而起的被誉为“平壤的骄傲”的一群群崭新建筑。
    当汽车驶到有名的叉路口时，纵目望去，林立的高层建筑分列在宽敞的大街两旁，往日这一带坑坑洼洼、杂草丛生的景象已经荡然无存。据朝鲜建设部第一副部长、光复大街建设总指挥金奉浩介绍，整个光复大街长6公里，宽100米，外加100米辅助道路。总建筑面积550万平方米，主要是住宅群，共计2.5万套。在9个生活区，都设有商店、学校、幼儿园、托儿所和公园。那一幢幢塔式、屏式、梯式的住宅楼，有的平地而起，沉稳厚重，有的矗立岗头，飘然欲飞，明丽柔和的色调使人赏心悦目，和谐淡雅的环境让人情趣横生。
    与光复大街毗邻的青春大街又是另一番景色。1个足球场、9个室内体育馆的建筑布局很自然地使它赢得“体育村”的美名。总建筑面积15万平方米、可容纳5万多观众的这10个体育场馆，以其良好的技术条件，完全具备同时进行20个项目40多种国际体育比赛的能力。据说这些体育场馆是为举办第13届世界青年联欢节而兴建的，云集平壤的各国运动员定会欣喜地发现，这里正是他们一显身手的理想场地。
    位于大同江中绫罗岛的5·1体育场以其独特的风采受到人们的青睐。绫罗岛的优美景致曾使朝鲜古代诗人留下“既有锦绣山，更见绫罗岛”等为后人传诵的佳句，而今鹤立在绿树丛中的5·1体育场又使它于优美之外平添了几分壮丽。据建设负责人金泰浩介绍，整个体育场占地面积40万平方米，建筑面积20.7万平方米，包括1个进行足球和田径比赛的主赛场，1个辅助赛场和3个有天然草坪的训练场，可容纳15万名观众。这座投资2亿多美元的体育场从开工到落成仅仅用了两年多一点时间。引人注目的是，这个主赛场顶棚的设计，其新颖独到处令人叹为观止。它既像一把鼓满天风的降落伞，又像一朵初露水面的芙蓉。这项设计佳构在去年日内瓦国际发明和新技术博览会上荣膺了金银奖。（附图片）
