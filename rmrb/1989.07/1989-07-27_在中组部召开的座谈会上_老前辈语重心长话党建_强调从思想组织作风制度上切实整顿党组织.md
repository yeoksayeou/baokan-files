Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 27th.

At the symposium on "Commemorating July 1 and Strengthening Party Building" held by the Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China, many senior comrades who joined the revolutionary work before the Anti-Japanese War spoke with deep concern and sincerity. They hoped to seriously summarize the experiences and lessons from the current struggle, and to thoroughly rectify the Party's organizations from the aspects of ideology, organization, work style, and system, thereby strengthening Party building and boosting the morale of all Party members.

**Start from the Central Leadership**

**All Levels of Party Organizations Should Focus on Party Building**

Comrade Chen Pixian said that after Comrade Zhao Ziyang became the General Secretary, he disappointed the Party and the people. People have many criticisms of him, the main one being that the General Secretary does not focus on Party building, does not rely on Party organizations at all levels to work, and does not play the role of the fortress of the grassroots Party organizations. Instead, he downplayed the Party's work and role, which led to a significant decline in the Party's prestige and a serious weakening of its appeal and cohesion among the masses. Party building has reached a point where it must be addressed. Starting from the Central Leadership, all levels of Party organizations must focus on Party building, including ideological, organizational, work style, and disciplinary building. In Party building, we must also calmly reflect on the past, consider the future, seriously address existing problems, restore and carry forward the Party's fine traditions, adapt to the new situation of reform and opening up and socialist modernization, and find a new path.

Comrade Chen Yun reminded the entire Party a few years ago that Party discipline is a matter of life and death for a ruling party. This time, it is even clearer. The reason this turmoil occurred is that the Party's discipline is not strict, and corruption has caused some of the masses to lose confidence in the Party. We have been calling for strict governance of the Party and the fight against corruption for several years, but the results have been limited. This time, we must not miss this good opportunity. We must do a few solid things to boost the morale of the Party and the people, so that the masses truly believe that our Party has the ability to eradicate corruption. This way, we can win the trust of the people, and the Party's prestige will be enhanced.

**Strengthen Party Ideological Building and Organizational Rectification**

Comrade Wang Heshou believes that this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion show that material civilization must be built simultaneously with socialist spiritual civilization. Without spiritual civilization, socialist construction will not succeed. Socialist spiritual civilization begins with the Party's discipline. If the Party's discipline is not strict, there will be no socialist spiritual civilization. The key to Party discipline is to educate Party members to strengthen their Party spirit. What kind of ideological consciousness produces what kind of actions. Now, it is said that laws, systems, and regulations can correct bad practices, which is undoubtedly correct, but these alone cannot fundamentally solve the problem. Many things cannot be controlled by regulations, systems, or even laws. For example, lack of initiative at work, procrastination, shifting responsibilities, and not criticizing or fighting against bad people and bad things, these cannot be controlled by laws and systems, but must be controlled by Party members and cadres' "legislation" in their minds, that is, they must act according to Party spirit. Party members should decide what can be done, what cannot be done, what should be done actively, and what should be fought against according to Party spirit principles. Once Party members have established laws in their minds and strengthened their Party spirit, bad practices will be reduced, and this will drive the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

Comrade Hu Qiaomu said that Party building must be strengthened from the aspects of ideology, morality, and organization. To strengthen Party building from the ideological aspect, serious theoretical thinking is needed. How to evaluate past work, how to assess the current situation, in which direction to move forward, what is socialism's economy, politics, and culture, and what are the fundamental differences with capitalism, why the slogan of "everything for money" is incompatible with socialist principles, etc., all these must be studied seriously by the entire Party and the national intellectual community and explained clearly to the Party, the people, and the youth. The reason why the capitalist liberalization trend has become rampant is that the Party has neglected theoretical work and underestimated the harm of various erroneous trends. To strengthen Party building from the moral aspect, the Communist Party of China must become a symbol of social morality. Party corruption must be resolutely eliminated, but this alone is not enough. The Party must show in its actions that it is indeed a force that has always struggled for social progress and social justice. To strengthen Party building from the organizational aspect, strict standards must be set for Party organizations and Party members. The harsh facts of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion show that even in peacetime, it is not easy to be a steadfast Communist Party member. He must work for the interests of the masses and gain their trust; he must also uphold principles. Sometimes he may be isolated, or even sacrifice his life, like some of the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops. In Party organizational building, there have been some unclear issues in the past, which need to be resolved now. For example, the issue of whether private enterprise owners can join the Party and how township enterprises should hire workers should be clearly regulated.

Comrade Huang Huoqing said that from the day a Party member joins the Party, he should strive for the ideal of communism and the liberation of all mankind. In the past, in the face of the enemy, he was fearless, and even under severe torture, he would not surrender, maintaining his revolutionary integrity. In battle, he would charge forward without fear of sacrifice. In work and study, he would strictly demand of himself according to the Party member's standards, and no matter how great the difficulty, he would grit his teeth and get through it. All this is because of the ideal of communism. Ideal education is indispensable for Communist Party members, but this has been talked about less in recent years. In the new historical conditions, Party ideal education, basic theory, and revolutionary history education must be greatly strengthened.

Comrade Chen Pixian said that the key to Party ideological building is education, especially the education of Party member leaders. Starting from the Central Leadership, starting from the Party leadership organs at all levels, a large-scale study should be carried out among Party member leaders to clarify what socialism is, what capitalism is, why socialism is good, and why capitalism is bad. Now, some people have "capitalism admiration syndrome," talking about capitalism's re-recognition, which is nothing more than overturning the conclusions of Marxist classics on capitalism.

Comrade Wang Shoudao said that this struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion is a test for every Party member. This struggle has exposed many serious problems in our Party's organizations and Party member ranks. Some comrades in the central organs and central state organs also went out to protest. The rectification of the ranks should start from the central organs. Every Party member should study well, reflect, examine his words and deeds, summarize experiences and lessons, improve his understanding, and clarify right from wrong. Those who are not suitable to work in the central organs should be transferred.

Comrade Gong Ping said that the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the rebellion has been a great victory. After the victory, we must clean up the battlefield, as Chairman Mao said, "It is better to pursue the defeated enemy bravely and not to learn from King Xiang Yu by seeking fame." The counter-revolutionary rebels must be thoroughly investigated. The rectification of the Party member ranks must also be carried out in depth.

**Play the Role of Grassroots Party Organizations and Strengthen Ideological and Political Work**

Comrade Kang Sheng said that the Party and government should be correctly understood. The separation of the Party and government refers to the separation of functions, not the separation of the family, which is to improve and strengthen the Party's leadership, not to weaken the Party's leadership. In recent years, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's downplaying of the Party's leadership, many enterprises' Party committees have been sidelined, political work departments have been abolished, and no one is in charge of ideological and political work, which is very dangerous. For enterprises, the enterprise Party committee should not practice the past "one-leadership" system, controlling everything, but should support the factory director in performing his duties. However, the Party should exercise political leadership over the enterprise, and the enterprise Party organization should take responsibility for ideological and political work and play a core role. Ideological and political work is to shape people's souls and worldviews, and its difficulty and complexity are not inferior to engineering technology work and other professional work. Excellent ideological and political workers are engineers of the human soul. In a sense, ideological and political work can also be transformed into productive forces. The material wealth created by enterprises, including technological achievements, is very important, relying on the improvement of people's ideological awareness. Therefore, a strong and effective ideological and political work team should be established, and necessary work institutions should be established. The Party should manage cadres, which is our Party's tradition. Now, in enterprises, deputy factory directors, section chiefs, and directors are all nominated and decided by the factory director, and one person decides everything, using whoever he wants, which is not acceptable. The Party committee should also seriously strengthen the building of grassroots Party branches. The past effective "three meetings and one class" system should be restored, so that Party branches can truly play the role of a fortress.

Comrade Lu Dingyi said that ideological and political work should be done well. In history, after the Xi'an Incident, the Red Army was reorganized into the National Revolutionary Army, and political commissars were changed to deputy positions (deputy commander, deputy division commander, etc.), and the political department was changed to the military training department. In less than a year, militarism emerged, and the Central Leadership decisively restored the political commissars and political departments, ensuring our victory. This time, our weaknesses in work have been exposed. A group of students, under the instigation of a few people with ulterior motives, went on a hunger strike, and every day many organs went to "comfort" and "support" them with flags. There should be a group of "professional revolutionaries" in the Communist Party. In our country's revolution, if we were not "professional revolutionaries," the revolution would not have succeeded. In the construction period, there should also be "professional revolutionaries." This is a very honorable profession, and its importance should be emphasized, and its social status should be universally respected. It is absolutely not acceptable to have the current situation where those who criticize the Communist Party and socialism the most have fame. In addition, there are some theoretical issues that need to be well studied. Now, whether it is Party courses or political courses in schools, there should be new content. Capitalism can no longer rule the world and only retains an economic advantage. The future is bright not for capitalist countries, not for the "free world," but for socialist countries.

Comrade Wu Xiuquan proposed that grassroots Party organizations should care about the lives of the masses and concretely do practical things for the masses, solving their practical problems. When the masses get benefits and see hope, they will be more willing to approach our Party, which is a big deal related to improving the Party's prestige.

### 在中组部召开的座谈会上  老前辈语重心长话党建  强调从思想组织作风制度上切实整顿党组织

    在中组部召开的座谈会上
    老前辈语重心长话党建
    强调从思想组织作风制度上切实整顿党组织
    本报讯　在中共中央组织部召开的“纪念‘七一’大力加强党的建设的座谈会”上，许多抗日战争以前参加革命工作的老同志在发言中语重心长，情深意切，希望认真总结当前这场斗争的经验教训，从思想上、组织上、作风上、制度上，切实整顿党的组织，大力加强党的建设，振奋全党同志的精神。
      从中央开始
  各级党组织都要聚精会神地抓党
  的建设
    陈丕显同志说，赵紫阳同志担任总书记后，辜负了党和人民的希望。人们对他的意见很多，其中主要的一条是，党的总书记不抓党的建设，不依靠各级党组织进行工作，不发挥基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用，而是淡化党的工作、党的作用，致使党的威信明显下降，党在群众中的感召力、凝聚力受到严重削弱。党的建设已经到了非抓不可的地步了。从中央开始，各级党组织都要聚精会神地抓党的建设，包括思想、组织、作风和纪律建设等等。在党的建设上，也要冷静地思考一下过去，考虑一下未来，认真清理存在的问题，恢复和发扬党的优良传统，适应改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的新形势，走出一条新路子。
    陈云同志前些年告诫全党，党风问题是关系到执政党生死存亡的大事。这次看得更清楚了。这场风波之所以发生，党风不正、腐败现象致使一部分群众对党丧失了信心，是一个重要原因。从严治党，克服腐败现象，我们喊了几年，但收效不大。这次千万不要错过了好时机。一定要扎扎实实地做几件振奋党心民心的事情，使群众真正相信我们党是有能力铲除腐败现象的。这样就能取信于民，党的威信就能提高。
  加强党的思想建设，搞好组织整顿
    王鹤寿同志认为，这次动乱和反革命暴乱说明：物质文明建设必须与社会主义精神文明建设同步进行，缺乏精神文明建设，社会主义建设不成。社会主义精神文明，首先是我们党的党风问题。党风不正就不会有社会主义的精神文明。党风建设的关键是教育党员增强党性。什么样的思想意识产生什么样的行动。现在讲，通过法律、制度、规章来纠正歪风，这无疑是正确的，但只有这些还不能从根本上解决问题。有很多事情是规章、制度，甚至法律管不了的。比如，工作不积极、消沉，遇事推诿、敷衍塞责，见了坏人坏事不批评不斗争等等，靠法律、制度管不了，要靠党员、干部思想上“立法”，也就是说要靠党性办事。党员根据党性原则，决定什么事可以做，什么事不可以做，什么事应积极地做，什么事要挺身而出进行斗争。党员在思想上立了法，党性加强了，不正之风就会减少，这就会把社会主义精神文明建设带动起来。
    胡乔木同志说，要从思想上、道义上、组织上加强党的建设。从思想上加强党的建设，要进行认真的理论思维。过去的工作怎样评价，现在的情况怎样估计，今后朝什么方向前进，社会主义的经济、政治、文化究竟是怎样的，与资本主义究竟有什么根本区别，为什么“一切向钱看”的口号与社会主义原则根本不相容等等，必须动员全党和全国思想界认真研究，向党向人民向青年讲清楚。资本主义自由化思潮之所以泛滥成灾，原因之一就是党对理论工作的忽视，对种种错误思潮的危害估计不足。从道义上加强党的建设，要使中国共产党成为社会道义的象征。党内腐败现象必须坚决清除，但仅仅做到这一点是不够的，党必须在行动上表明自己确实是一支永远为社会进步和社会公正而奋斗的力量。从组织上加强党的建设，要对党组织和党员提出严格的标准。动乱和暴乱的严酷事实说明，即使在和平时期，做一个坚定的共产党员也并不容易。他既要为群众谋利益，受群众信任；又要坚持原则。有时也会孤立，甚至作出生命的牺牲，像戒严部队的一些官兵那样。在党的组织建设上，过去有一些不明确的问题，现在要加以解决。例如私营企业主能否入党和乡镇企业如何雇工的问题，应做出明确的规定。
    黄火青同志说，一个党员从入党第一天起，就要为共产主义理想，为全人类的解放奋斗到底。过去在敌人面前无所畏惧，严刑拷打也决不屈服，保持革命气节。战斗中前赴后继，不怕牺牲。工作学习中严格按党员标准要求自己，再大的困难一咬牙也就过去了。这些都是因为有共产主义理想。理想教育对共产党员来讲是不可缺少的，可这些年讲得少了。在新的历史条件下，党的理想教育、基础理论和革命历史教育必须大大加强。
    陈丕显同志说，党的思想建设重要的是抓教育，特别是对党员领导干部的教育。要从中央做起，从各级党的领导机关做起，在党员领导干部中开展一次大学习，弄清什么是社会主义，什么是资本主义，社会主义为什么好，资本主义为什么不好。现在有的人得了“爱资病”，搞什么资本主义的再认识，无非是推翻马克思主义经典著作对资本主义的结论。
    王首道同志说，这场制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争，对每个党员都是一个考验。这场斗争暴露了我们党的组织和党员队伍中存在不少严重问题。中直机关、中央国家机关一些同志也上街游行。清理队伍工作要从中央机关做起。每个党员都要很好地学习、反思，检查自己的言论行动，总结经验教训，提高认识，分清是非。不适合在中央机关工作的，要调离。
    耿飚同志说，制止动乱、平息暴乱，我们打了个大胜仗。战后要打扫战场，如毛主席说的“宜将胜勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”。对反革命暴乱分子必须彻底清查。党员队伍的清理工作也要深入地进行下去。
      发挥党的基层组织的作用，
  加强思想政治工作
    康世恩同志说，要正确认识党政分开。党政分开是指党政职能分开，而不是分家，是为了改善和加强党的领导，而不是削弱党的领导。这几年，由于赵紫阳同志淡化党的领导造成的恶劣影响，不少企业的党委靠边站了，政工部门被取消了，思想政治工作无人管了，这种状况是十分危险的。就企业来说，企业党委不要搞过去那种“一元化”领导，包揽一切，而要支持厂长行使自己的职责。但是，党对企业要实行政治领导，企业党组织在思想政治工作上要负起责任来，发挥核心作用。思想政治工作是塑造人的灵魂，塑造人的世界观的，它的难度和复杂性不亚于工程技术工作和其它业务工作。优秀的思想政治工作者是人类灵魂的工程师。从某种意义上来说，思想政治工作同样可以转化为生产力，企业创造的物质财富，包括科技成果，很重要的一条是依靠人们思想觉悟的提高。所以要建立一支精干的强有力的思想政治工作队伍，建立必要的工作机构。党要管干部，这是我们党历来的传统。现在，企业里的副厂长、科长、主任都由厂长提名、决定，一个人说了算，想用谁就用谁，这不行。党委还要认真加强基层党支部的建设。过去行之有效的“三会一课”制度，应该恢复起来，使党支部真正发挥战斗堡垒作用。
    陆定一同志说，要把思想政治工作做好。历史上西安事变后，红军改编为国民革命军，把政治委员变为副职（副司令、副师长等），政治部变为军训处。不到一年，军阀主义就抬头了，中央当机立断，恢复了政治委员和政治部，保证了我们的胜利。这一次把我们工作的弱点来了个大暴露。一批学生在极少数别有用心的人的煽动下绝食，居然每天有许多机关打着旗子去“慰问”、“支援”。共产党里应有一批“职业革命家”。在我国革命中，我们如果不是“职业革命家”，革命不会胜利。在建设时期也应该有“职业革命家”。这是一种很光荣的职业，其重要性应该得到强调，其社会地位应该得到普遍的尊重。绝对不能像现在那样，谁把共产党和社会主义骂得凶，谁就有名气。另外，还有一些思想理论上的问题，需要很好地进行研究。现在无论党课也好，学校里的政治课也好，应该有新的内容。资本主义早已不能统治世界，只保留着一个经济优势。前途光明的，不是资本主义国家，不是“自由世界”，而是社会主义国家。
    伍修权同志提出，党的基层组织要关心群众的生活，切切实实为群众办实事，解决他们的实际问题。群众得到了实惠，觉得有希望了，才能更加同我们党接近，这是关系到提高党的威望的大事。
