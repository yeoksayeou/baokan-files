Gorbachev Proposes Unilateral Reduction of Short-Range Missiles
Bush Disagrees with Gorbachev's New Proposal

PARIS, July 7 (Xinhua) — Soviet leader Gorbachev yesterday, in a lengthy speech to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, said that if NATO countries are willing to negotiate on the issue of short-range missiles, the Soviet Union will immediately continue to unilaterally reduce short-range missiles in Europe.

Gorbachev said that the path to a "European house" should begin with the reduction of nuclear weapons, which is related to the "house's" security. He reiterated the need to replace "deterrence" with "moderation" and expressed his belief that the Vienna talks could lead to a significant reduction in conventional weapons in Europe over the next two to three years. However, he noted, "On the issue of the final elimination of nuclear weapons, we face a somewhat different path. Europeans can travel this path together without abandoning their respective positions. The Soviet Union can remain true to its ideal of a non-nuclear world, while Western Europe can retain its view of minimal nuclear deterrence."

Gorbachev also proposed, "We support the dissolution of military blocs and are ready to start political dialogue immediately to create an atmosphere of mutual trust." However, he pointed out, "The difficulties on the path to the two Europes are that some in the West believe that overcoming Europe's division means defeating socialism. If this is the case, any unity is impossible to achieve."

The French Foreign Minister said that Gorbachev's speech was "a major step towards Western Europe."

WASHINGTON, July 6 (Xinhua) — President Bush today said he disagrees with Gorbachev's new proposal for early negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons.

Bush made the statement before his upcoming visit to Poland and Hungary, speaking to foreign journalists at the White House. He said that the United States' proposal in May to reduce conventional forces is a "widely supported good plan," and Western countries have indicated that they will not hold negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons until an agreement is reached on reducing conventional forces in Europe. He said he does not see any reason to change NATO's decision on this matter.

The Soviet Union's new proposal was made by Gorbachev on July 6 during his visit to France, when he addressed the European Parliament. Experts here believe that Gorbachev's new proposal is a political challenge to NATO's decision.

    戈氏提出单方裁减短导新建议
    布什不同意戈尔巴乔夫新建议
    本报巴黎7月7日电  记者吕网大报道：苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫昨天在斯特拉斯堡对欧洲委员会发表长篇演讲时表示：如果北约国家愿意就短导问题与我们进行谈判的话，苏联将立即在欧洲继续单方面削减短程导弹。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，通向“欧洲大厦”应从削减核武器开始，这关系到“大厦”的安全。他重申要以“温和”代替“威慑”，并表示相信维也纳谈判可能在今后两三年内使欧洲的常规武器大幅度削减。但是，“在最终全部销毁核武器问题上，我们面前有着一段不尽相同的道路。欧洲人可以在不放弃各自立场的情况下，一起通过这段路程。苏联可以忠实于他的无核世界的理想，而西欧则可保留它的最低核威慑的观点”。
    戈尔巴乔夫还提出“我们赞同解散军事集团，并就此立即进行政治对话，以创造一种相互信任的气氛”。不过，他又指出“两个欧洲接近道路上的困难是，西方有人认为要克服欧洲的分裂就意味着要战胜社会主义，倘若如此，任何联合都是不可能实现的”。
    法国外长认为，戈的讲话是“朝西欧迈出的一大步”。
    本报华盛顿7月6日电 记者张启昕报道：布什总统今天表示，他不同意戈尔巴乔夫提出的尽早举行短程核武器谈判的新建议。
    布什是在他即将去波兰、匈牙利访问前，在白宫向外国新闻记者作出这一表示的。他说，美国在5月间提出的削减常规力量的计划是一个“得到广泛支持的好计划”，西方国家已表明，在达成削减欧洲常规力量协议前，不举行短程核武器谈判。他说，他现在看不出有什么理由要改变北约作出的这一决定。
    苏联的新建议是戈尔巴乔夫6日在访问法国期间向欧洲委员会发表讲话时提出的。此间专家们认为，戈尔巴乔夫的新建议是对北约决定的政治性挑战。
