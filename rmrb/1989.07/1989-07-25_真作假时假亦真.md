Title: When Truth Becomes Falsehood, Falsehood Becomes Truth

Recently, there have been frequent reports of direct talks between Israel and the PLO, but it all seems like a "puzzle."

On the 24th, Chairman Arafat revealed to the Italian newspaper "Il Messaggero" that a member of the PLO Executive Committee had a meeting with a member of the Israeli Likud Central Committee in Vienna, even showing the meeting records. However, Shamir's office spokesperson denied it, saying it was false.

One day later, Arafat disclosed that Shamir himself had met with a representative closely associated with the PLO over the past two weeks, proposing the idea of "semi-independence" for the occupied territories in the future. This time, Israeli officials said it was true.

How interesting. Truth and falsehood intertwine.

Israel's statements of truth and falsehood are akin to the phrase from the Chinese classic "Dream of the Red Chamber," "When falsehood becomes truth, truth becomes falsehood." It can be said, "When truth becomes falsehood, falsehood becomes truth."

There are written records of direct talks between Israel and the PLO, but they insist it is false. One can understand their predicament, perhaps due to the Israeli law used to prosecute people, "Whoever talks with PLO representatives will be sentenced." Or perhaps it is to avoid breaking the repeated thousand times oath, "We will never talk with the PLO."

If it is indeed the case, then why would the direct talks acknowledged as true, and even involving Shamir himself with a Palestinian representative, be any different?

Upon closer examination, it turns out that the Israeli government is playing word games. Pressured by the situation, negotiations cannot be avoided. However, if the negotiating partner bears the "PLO" label, it is denied; otherwise, if they pretend not to know the partner is a "PLO" member, it is acknowledged.

In fact, Israel talking with PLO representatives is no longer a big deal. Israel's old friend, the United States, is already in direct talks with the PLO, and has come up with the self-deprecating tactic of "talking does not mean recognizing." What face does Israel, the little partner of the United States, have to lose?

### “真作假时假亦真”

    “真作假时假亦真”
    近来，以色列与巴解组织直接会谈的消息屡有所闻，却还真象是个“谜”。
    阿拉法特主席24日对意大利《信使报》透露，巴解执委会一名成员在维也纳与以色列利库德集团中央委员会成员举行过会谈，甚至还展示了会谈记录。可是，沙米尔办公室发言人矢口否认，说这是假的。
    一天后，阿拉法特又揭示，沙米尔本人在过去两周内跟一位与巴解组织关系密切的巴勒斯坦人代表会谈过，还提出了所谓被占领区将来实现“半独立”的政治见解。这回，以色列官员又说，这是真的。
    妙哉。真真假假，假假真真。
    以色列的真假之说，酷似中国文学名著《红楼梦》中的那句“假作真时真亦假”的反义派生句，可谓“真作假时假亦真”。
    有白纸黑字记录的以巴直接会谈，硬说是假的。谅其苦衷，恐怕是慑于曾经用来整过人的以色列法规，“谁与巴解代表谈判谁将被判刑”。再不，就是有损于重复过千百次的“绝不与巴解会谈”的誓言。
    真要如此，那么被承认是真的直接会谈，而且是沙米尔本人与巴勒斯坦代表进行的会谈，又作何解释呢？
    仔细琢磨起来，原来以色列政府在玩弄文字游戏。形势所逼，谈判已经挡不住了。而谈判对手挂“PLO（巴解）”字母标志的，一概否认；反之，假装不知道对手是“PLO”成员的，就承认下来。
    其实，以色列与巴解组织代表会谈已经算不上什么大了不起的事了。以色列的老朋友美国，都在与巴解组织直接会谈，而且想出“会谈不等于承认”的自我解嘲高招，美国的小伙伴以色列还有什么抹不开面子的呢？
