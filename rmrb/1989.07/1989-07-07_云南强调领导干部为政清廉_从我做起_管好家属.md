    Yunnan Emphasizes Clean Governance by Leaders
    Start with Myself and Manage Family Members

    Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, July 7th - (Reporter Luo Ping) At the provincial anti-corruption meeting yesterday, the Secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, Pu Chaozhu, said that to govern cleanly and combat corruption, leading cadres must first strictly demand of themselves, start with themselves, and manage their family members and the staff around them.

    This meeting, attended by deputy secretaries and discipline inspection commission secretaries from various prefectures, cities, and party committees, focused on how to overcome obstacles and effectively implement anti-corruption and clean governance work. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee decided that starting from the provincial committee, to the prefectures, cities, and various departments and bureaus, all leading cadres must seriously organize their family members to study "A Letter from Comrade Nie Rongzhen on Requiring Cadres to Educate Their Children Well," and study the Party Central Committee and State Council's regulations on prohibiting party and government agencies and cadres from engaging in business and entrepreneurship, and prohibiting the children and spouses of leading cadres from doing business. They must conduct self-examinations, hold family meetings, and then conduct organizational life activities. Each leading member must actively report the situation of their family's self-examination to the party organization. If there are illegal or disciplinary violations in oneself and one's family, and they are voluntarily reported to the organization, they can be treated leniently; if they are not reported and are found through public reports and verified, they will be dealt with severely. Provincial and department-level cadres will do this first, followed by county and division-level cadres.

    Pu Chaozhu said that to combat corruption, we must strengthen the Party's leadership and establish a powerful organizational coordination mechanism. The Yunnan Provincial Party Committee has established a leading group for anti-corruption and clean governance, with Pu Chaozhu as the head, and Li Xingwang, the chairman of the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Luo Yuntong, the secretary of the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, and Deputy Governor Jin Renqing as deputy heads. Corresponding office organizations have also been established. Prefectures, cities, counties, and provincial departments and bureaus are also required to establish corresponding organizations, with a responsible comrade specifically in charge of this work. We must organize all supervisory departments to form a complete and powerful anti-corruption supervision system.

    Pu Chaozhu also said that to combat corruption and promote clean governance, we must rely on the masses, follow the mass line, and establish and improve the system of mass supervision. All supervisory functional departments must seriously handle the reporting centers, set up more reporting stations, and make it convenient for the masses, so that the masses have a way to report and supervision has a direction.

    云南强调领导干部为政清廉
    从我做起  管好家属
    新华社昆明7月7日电　（记者罗苹）中共云南省委书记普朝柱昨天在全省纪检工作会议上说，为政清廉，惩治腐败，领导干部首先要严格要求自己，从我做起，管好家属，管好身边的工作人员。
    由各地州市委分管纪检工作的副书记和纪委书记参加的这次会议，专门研究如何排除阻力，扎扎实实地把惩治腐败、廉政建设的工作抓出实效来。云南省委决定，从省委开始，到各地州市、各部委办厅局的领导干部，都要严肃认真地组织各自的家庭成员学习《聂荣臻同志关于要求干部教育好子女的一封信》，学习党中央、国务院关于不准党政机关和党政干部经商办企业，不准领导干部的子女、配偶经商等规定，对照检查，开好家庭会。然后过一次组织生活，每个领导成员都要主动把家庭对照检查的情况，向党组织作一次负责的汇报。如果自己和家庭有违法违纪行为，向组织自查自报了，可以从宽处理；如果自己不交待，经过群众举报，查证属实，要从严处理。省委和地厅的干部先搞，然后县处干部搞。
    普朝柱说，惩治腐败，要加强党的领导，成立强有力的组织协调机构。云南省委已成立反对腐败、廉政建设的领导小组，由普朝柱任组长，省顾委主任李兴旺、省纪委书记罗运通、副省长金人庆任副组长，并相应成立了办事机构。地州市县委和省属各厅局也要求成立相应的组织，由一位负责同志专门负责此项工作。要把各个监督部门组织起来，使之形成一个完整的强有力的反腐败的监督体系。
    普朝柱还说，惩治腐败，廉政建设，要依靠群众，走群众路线，建立健全群众监督的制度。各监督职能部门要认真办好举报中心，多设举报站点，方便群众，使群众告状有门，监督有方。
