Prime Minister Uno Sosuke declared yesterday that he will not resign even if the Liberal Democratic Party suffers a crushing defeat in the upcoming House of Councillors election.

According to reports from local newspapers today, Uno summoned the acting secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party, Eto, and the deputy secretary-general, Fukaya, to the Prime Minister's official residence last night to discuss the situation after the election.

Voting for the House of Councillors election is taking place today, and the situation is extremely unfavorable for the Liberal Democratic Party. Local public opinion points out that the Liberal Democratic Party is facing a difficult situation due to multiple unfavorable factors such as the consumption tax, the Recruit scandal, agricultural liberalization policies, and the Prime Minister's personal scandal. The election results are likely to be unfavorable. If the party loses too many seats, Uno will be held responsible.

Uno took office in early June after the resignation of former Prime Minister Takeshita, and his term is set to end in late October. Local public opinion believes that there is still a possibility that Uno will resign before then.

According to reports from local newspapers today, Uno emphasized yesterday that the Japanese government will use all the revenue from the consumption tax for welfare projects.

The consumption tax is a new tax system established by the Japanese government in April this year, which requires a 3% tax to be paid to the state on all consumption transactions, thereby increasing government revenue.

Uno had previously stated that 60% of the consumption tax revenue would be mainly used for welfare, but this is the first time he has mentioned using 100% for welfare.

Local public opinion believes that the Liberal Democratic Party, with Uno as its president, is in a very unfavorable position in today's House of Councillors election due to the consumption tax, the Recruit scandal, agricultural liberalization policies, and Uno's personal scandal. In order to win votes, Uno, in addition to making the above statement, also promised to amend the unpopular consumption tax.

    宇野表示无意辞职
    许诺消费税收入将全部用于福利
    新华社东京7月23日电  日本首相宇野宗佑昨天表示，即便自民党在这次参院选举中遭到惨败，他也不会辞职。
    据此间报纸今天报道，昨天夜里，宇野在首相官邸召见自民党代理干事长江藤、副干事长深谷，就参院选举后的形势进行了会谈。
    日本参院选举今天投票，选举形势对自民党十分不利。此间舆论指出，自民党面临消费税、利库路特贿赂案、农业自由化政策、首相生活丑闻等多种不利因素造成的难堪局面，选举结果凶多吉少。如果它失掉的席位过多，宇野将被追究责任。
    宇野是在前首相竹下引咎辞职后于今年6月初上台的，任期到今年10月底届满。此间舆论认为，宇野在此之前辞职的可能性仍然存在。
    新华社东京7月23日电 据此间报纸今天报道，宇野宗佑首相昨天在这里强调，日本政府将把消费税的收入全部用于福利事业。
    消费税是今年4月日本政府设立的一种新的税制，它规定所有消费环节都要向国家交纳消费额3％的税金，以此增加政府收入。
    宇野先前曾说过将消费税收入的60％主要用于福利方面，而百分之百地用于福利的提法还是首次。
    此间舆论认为，以宇野为总裁的日本自民党因消费税、利库路特贿赂丑闻、农业自由化政策和宇野本人的生活丑闻等，在今天举行投票的参议院选举中处于十分不利的地位。为了争取选票，宇野除了作上述发言外，还许诺将修改为国民普遍不满的消费税。
