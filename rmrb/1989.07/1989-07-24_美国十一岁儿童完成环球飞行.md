Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 22nd.

An 11-year-old boy from Alaska, Tony Ailingena, stepped down from a "Cessna" light aircraft today, landing on the same runway from which he took off 7 weeks ago for his global flight. He has become the youngest person in history to circumnavigate the globe by air.

Tony landed at John Wayne Airport at 2:28 PM, having flown 17,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) and crossed through 7 countries, including the United States and the Soviet Union, making 35 takeoffs and landings.

Tony, who is in the fifth grade, began his global flight on June 5th. The initial 14,000-mile journey was smooth. Tony's father sat beside him, assisting with navigation, weather observation, and communication with ground control.

However, last week, Tony landed in Nome for a short rest. His father, piloting the light aircraft, took him 60 miles away to Golovin for fishing. They used a public road as a runway, but the plane crashed during landing, and Tony sustained minor injuries.

Tony was heartbroken and shed tears because only 3,000 miles remained of his global journey. At this point, a kind-hearted pilot lent Tony his own "Cessna" aircraft, allowing him to complete this historic flight.

During his journey, Tony landed in Moscow and was received by Soviet leader Gorbachev. Tony said he plans to visit the White House soon to present a list to President Bush, signed by 200,000 children expressing their wish for peace.

    美国十一岁儿童完成环球飞行
    新华社华盛顿7月22日电　美国阿拉斯加州11岁的托尼·艾林格纳今天从一架“赛斯纳”轻型飞机上攀扶而下，踏上了7周前起飞作环球飞行的同一条跑道，成为世界历史上最年轻的围绕地球飞行一周的人。
    托尼是在下午2点28分降落到约翰·韦恩机场的，他飞行了1.7万英里（3万公里），穿越了美国、苏联等7个国家，起降35次。
    今年读小学五年级的托尼6月5日开始了他的环球飞行，最初的1.4万英里航程十分顺利。托尼的父亲一直坐在他身边，帮助领航、观测气候、与地面指挥员联系。
    但就在上周，托尼降落在诺姆作短暂休息，他父亲驾驶那架轻型飞机和他到60英里外的戈洛文钓鱼，把一段公路当成了跑道，降落过程中飞机坠毁，托尼受了轻伤。
    托尼伤心地落下了眼泪，因为他的环球旅行只剩下了最后3000英里。此时，一位好心的飞行员把他自己的“赛斯纳”飞机借给了托尼，使他能够完成这次历史性飞行。
    托尼在飞行途中曾经降落在莫斯科，并受到了苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫的接见。托尼说，他计划不久将访问白宫，向布什总统递交一份名册，名册上有20万儿童为表达他们热爱和平的愿望而签下了自己的名字。
