An underwater volcano erupted near Izu Peninsula, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, on the afternoon of July 13th. Some local residents have begun evacuating to safer areas. Relevant authorities believe that there is a possibility of continued eruptions and are taking further preventive measures.

According to Japanese newspapers, around 6:30 PM on July 13th, approximately 3 kilometers off the coast of Ito City, Shizuoka Prefecture, several muffled explosions were heard, followed by a blackish-gray column of smoke rising into the sky. Simultaneously, a water column about 30 meters high and 100 meters in diameter was observed, repeating this phenomenon six times. Light earthquakes were felt in a wide area centered around Ito City. Coastal roads in Ito City were closed to traffic, and some residents began evacuating to safer areas or other locations. As of now, there have been no reported casualties.

Since the end of last month, this region has experienced multiple earthquakes.

The Japan Meteorological Agency is closely monitoring this volcanic activity, believing that there is a possibility of continued eruptions, and has called for heightened vigilance. The relevant regional maritime safety agencies and the Self-Defense Forces have also been put on alert.

    日本一座海底火山爆发
    新华社东京7月14日电　13日下午，日本静冈县伊豆半岛伊东湾附近海底火山爆发，一部分当地居民开始到安全地方避难，有关部门认为今后有可能继续喷火，正在采取进一步的防范措施。
    据日本报纸报道，13日下午6时30分许，离静冈县伊东市海岸3公里附近海面，随着几声沉闷的巨响，一股灰黑色的烟尘冲天而起，同时掀起高30米、直径约100米的高大水柱，这种景色连续出现6次。以伊东市为中心的广大地区发生轻度地震。伊东市内沿海岸道路禁止通行，一部分居民开始到安全地带或外地避难，目前尚无人员伤亡。
    从上月底起，这一地区曾连续发生多次地震。
    日本气象厅对这次火山活动极为关注，认为今后有可能继续喷火，要求各方面提高警惕。有关地区海上保安本部及陆海空自卫队也已进入戒备状态。
