    Jiang Zemin Meets with Azad, Emphasizes China's Unchanged Major Policies

    BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) — CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with the General Secretary of the Indian National Congress (U.K.) Azad in the Zhongnanhai this afternoon.

    Jiang Zemin, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, welcomed Azad's first visit to China. He said, "Azad General Secretary is visiting China after our country has achieved decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. This is also the first time I am receiving a foreign guest since I took office as General Secretary."

    Jiang Zemin praised the Indian National Congress (U.K.) and the Indian government for their stance of non-interference in China's internal affairs regarding the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He said, "China will not change its policies due to this turmoil. China adheres to the Four Cardinal Principles, the policy of reform and opening up, and an independent foreign policy of peace. We will continue to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and develop friendly relations with political parties of various countries on the basis of the Four Principles of Party-to-Party Relations."

    Jiang Zemin pointed out that the Communist Party of China has led the Chinese people for 68 years, and through the sacrifice of tens of millions of people, we have won the socialist People's Republic. Some people in the West are trying every means to change our socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party, but this will not succeed. The Chinese people will never allow it. Some countries want to use economic sanctions to pressure us, but this is in vain. The Chinese people will not yield to any external pressure.

    Jiang Zemin said, "We continue to welcome trade and economic and technological cooperation with countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. During my time in Shanghai, I often told many friends from the business community that our cooperation should be based on mutual understanding, mutual trust, mutual benefit, and long-term considerations. Now, some people in the West are short-sighted, which is not beneficial to both sides, especially to themselves."

    Azad General Secretary expressed that the developments in China are China's internal affairs and should be chosen by the Chinese people themselves. He also conveyed the congratulations from the Chairman of the Indian National Congress (U.K.) Rajiv Gandhi and himself to Jiang Zemin on his appointment as General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee.

    Jiang Zemin, on behalf of Premier Li Peng, asked Azad General Secretary to convey his greetings to Rajiv Gandhi.

    Both sides expressed their desire to further develop friendly relations between the two parties and the two countries.

    Azad General Secretary and his wife arrived in Beijing yesterday after visiting the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for a short visit to China. CPC Central Committee member and Director of the International Liaison Department Zhu Liang held talks with Azad General Secretary. The Indian guests will leave Beijing tomorrow to return home.

    江泽民会见阿扎德时强调
    中国大政方针不变
    本报北京7月6日讯　中共中央总书记江泽民今天下午在中南海会见印度国大党（英）总书记阿扎德。
    江泽民代表中共中央欢迎阿扎德总书记对中国的第一次访问。他说，阿扎德总书记是在我国平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利后来访的，这也是我担任总书记后第一次接待外国客人。
    江泽民赞赏印度国大党（英）和印度政府对我国平息反革命暴乱所采取的不干涉内政的立场。他说，中国不会因这场风波改变自己的政策，中国坚持四项基本原则不变，坚持改革开放政策不变，坚持独立自主的和平外交政策不变，将继续在和平共处五项原则基础上发展同各国的友好关系，在党际关系四项原则基础上发展同各国政党的友好关系。
    江泽民指出，中国共产党领导中国人民奋斗了68年，用几千万人的流血牺牲换来了社会主义的人民共和国。西方国家有些人千方百计想改变我们的社会主义制度和共产党的领导是办不到的，中国人民决不答应。有些国家想用经济制裁来压垮我们也是徒劳的，中国人民是不会屈服于任何外来压力的。
    江泽民说，我们继续欢迎各国在平等互利基础上同我国进行贸易往来和经济技术合作。我在上海工作期间同许多外国企业界的朋友讲过，我们双方之间的合作要坚持互相了解、互相信任、互利和长远考虑。现在西方有些人的做法是短视的，这对双方特别是他们自己不利。
    阿扎德总书记表示，中国事态的发展是中国的内政，应由中国人民选择他们自己的道路和未来。他还转达了国大党（英）主席拉吉夫·甘地总理和他本人对江泽民担任中共中央总书记的祝贺。
    江泽民总书记并代表李鹏总理，请阿扎德总书记转达对拉吉夫·甘地总理的问候。
    宾主双方表达了进一步发展两党两国友好关系的愿望。
    阿扎德总书记和夫人是在访问朝鲜民主主义人民共和国之后于昨天来到北京，对我国进行短暂访问的。中共中央委员、中联部部长朱良与阿扎德总书记进行了会谈。印度客人将于明天离开北京回国。（附图片）
