Chinese Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, who is also the Chairman of the Chinese side of the Sino-Soviet Economic, Trade, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee, and the Chinese delegation he leads, arrived in Moscow by plane on the evening of July 20 to attend the 4th meeting of the Cooperation Committee.

Soviet First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers and Chairman of the Soviet side of the Cooperation Committee Maslyukov and other relevant officials greeted the Chinese delegation at the airport.

Tian Jiyun said in response to a reporter's question that the 4th meeting of the Cooperation Committee is being held after the normalization of relations between the two countries, and the Chinese government attaches great importance to it. The meeting will not only review the achievements of cooperation between the two sides in the past, but also explore new areas for future cooperation and development. He expressed his belief that this meeting will achieve results.

The 3rd meeting of the Sino-Soviet Economic, Trade, and Scientific and Technological Cooperation Committee was held in Beijing last June.

In recent years, economic and trade relations between China and the Soviet Union have developed rapidly. In 1988, the trade volume between the two countries reached 4.1 billion Swiss francs, and this year's trade volume is expected to increase by 17% compared to last year.

The Soviet Union has become China's fifth-largest trading partner.
