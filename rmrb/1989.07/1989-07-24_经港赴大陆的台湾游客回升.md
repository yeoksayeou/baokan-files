Since July, the number of Taiwanese tourists traveling to mainland China via Hong Kong has significantly increased, nearly reaching the same level as last year during the same period.

The head of the Hong Kong branch of the China Travel Service (CTS) told reporters that from July 1 to July 20, over 26,000 Taiwanese tourists traveled to mainland China via Hong Kong for tourism, visiting relatives, or business, approaching last year's figure of 30,000 for the same period. In recent days, more than 2,000 Taiwanese tourists have been traveling to mainland China via Hong Kong each day. It is estimated that the number of Taiwanese tourists traveling to mainland China via Hong Kong in July will reach around 50,000.

The head of CTS mentioned that in serving Taiwanese tourists, they have been continuously summarizing experiences and striving to improve service standards. They are currently planning to launch new tourism routes based on the needs and characteristics of Taiwanese tourists. These routes include the East China (Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou) and Guilin lines, as well as the Fujian Wuyishan line and the Fujian Meizhou line, providing services for Taiwanese tourists to visit the Meizhou Mazu Temple. It is anticipated that early September, which is said to be the day Mazu ascends to heaven, will see a peak in Taiwanese tourists visiting for pilgrimage.
