Title: A Suggestion to Solve the Public Toilet Problem

I read Ai Xiao's article "On the Public Toilets of Beijing" published on the fifth page of the June 3rd issue of the People's Daily and found it very inspiring. In response, I would like to offer a suggestion as a supplement to the article.

I have visited Japan three times and specifically paid attention to whether they have the same "toilet problem" as we do. From what I observed, this problem does not exist in Japan. Their solution is that all shops, including large and small commercial stores and restaurants, as well as other industries, have small toilets for both employees and customers to use. Some of these toilets are so small that only one person can stand inside at a time. In busy streets, public places, and areas with many people, there are, of course, also public toilets (they call them restrooms). With more public toilets, it is less likely to be crowded, and I have never seen people queuing up to use the toilet.

In Japan, as long as there are customers, they consider the convenience of their customers, at least by providing toilets and telephones for customers to use. Moreover, their public toilets are usually equipped with three essentials: toilet paper, hand-washing facilities, and deodorizers. Some even have infrared hand dryers (you just stick your hand out after washing, and it dries without needing a towel). Imagine a customer in a bar or restaurant having a drink or meal, and when they need to use the toilet, they have to leave the place to find a public toilet outside. This is first and foremost disrespectful to the customer and might even cause the loss of a customer.

Most mid-range and below restaurants and shops in Beijing do not have toilets for customers, which is not only a problem in Beijing but also a significant cause of the "public toilet problem" nationwide.

I believe that solving the "public toilet problem" should focus on a policy of private management as the primary approach and public management as a supplementary measure, especially emphasizing the improvement of standards and management. In foreign countries, the three cleanest places are the toilets, bathrooms, and kitchens, while we are the opposite, and people have become accustomed to this.

Currently, our public toilets are not few in number. If we add privately managed toilets, I believe this will alleviate the current tense situation. The bigger problem is hygiene. Some toilets are so dirty that they are unusable. If we only focus on the state building more public toilets without improving management, the result will be that the more we build, the dirtier and more chaotic they become. Some foreign tourists have said that the most troublesome thing when coming to China is finding a usable public toilet. Some foreigners have even vowed never to come to China again because of this.

Toilets may be small, but they are a window to a country's civilization. Should we consider mobilizing all shops that have the capability to build their own toilets to expand and convert them into public toilets within a set period? The specific measures can be discussed by the urban construction, health, and environmental protection departments. I believe that as long as a shop has water and sewage facilities, it should have the conditions to build a toilet. Additionally, the state's focus should be on managing large public toilets. With the supplement of privately managed toilets, there may not be a need to build more large public toilets. The focus can be on management. If this can be done, I believe that the state can fundamentally solve the public toilet problem without increasing significant investment.

    为解决公厕问题献一计
    王玉亭
    读了6月3日《人民日报》第五版艾笑的文章《却说北京的公厕》，很受启发，为此我愿献上一计作为该文的补充。
    我曾三次访问过日本，特别注意过他们的“厕所问题”是否和我们一样存在？据我看到的，这个问题在日本根本不存在。他们的办法是所有店铺包括大小商店和饮食店以及其它各行各业都有供内部职工和顾客共用的小厕所，有的小到只能站立一个人。大街上的繁华区、公共场所和人多的地方当然也都有公共厕所（他们叫洗手所），公厕一多，当然就不会那么拥挤，我从没见到很多人排队上厕所的现象。
    在日本只要有顾客光顾的地方，他们都要为顾客方便着想，至少备有厕所和电话供顾客使用，而且他们的公厕大都是三配套，即备有手纸、洗手设备并且厕内放有除臭剂，有的还配备红外线烘手（洗完手一伸就干了，不用手绢擦）。试想一个顾客在一个酒馆或饭店喝酒或吃饭，中间要大小便时还得离开这里到外边去找公厕，这首先是对顾客的不尊重，说不定还会因此失掉顾客。
    北京市绝大部分中档以下的餐馆和商店都没有供顾客用的厕所，这不仅是北京、恐怕也是全国的“公厕问题”产生的一个重要原因。
    我认为，解决“公厕问题”要着眼于私办为主、公办为辅的方针，特别要注重档次的提高和管理的改善。在国外最卫生的地方有3个，即厕所、浴室、厨房，而我们在这方面却恰好相反，人们也习惯了。
    目前我们的公厕按说数量不算少，如能加上私办的，我认为是会缓解目前的紧张状况的。更大的问题是卫生太差，有的根本没法进去。如果一味追求国家多建公厕而管理又跟不上，其结果是建的越多，脏乱的愈厉害。有的外国旅游者说，到中国来最发愁的是没法进公厕，有的外国人为此甚至发誓永不再来中国。
    厕所虽小，但它是一个国家的文明窗口。是否考虑发动所有具备自设厕所的店铺，限期扩建为公厕，至于具体办法可由城建、卫生、环保等部门来商订。我认为只要有上下水道的店铺，应该说都有建厕的条件。另外，国家的重点是大的公厕管理，有了私办的补充，就不一定要再多建大的公厕，注意力集中于管理就可以了。如能这样，我相信，国家不用增加大的投资就能从根本上解决公厕问题。
