The 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championship opened today in Beijing. Our reporter, Miu Lu, reports: Today, in the first round of the preliminary matches of the 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championship, the host team, China, had an inauspicious start, with both of the young boxers who competed being eliminated. The strong South Korean team had three boxers in action today, all of whom emerged victorious.

In today's matches, the first Chinese boxer to compete was Chen Yuan in the 54-kilogram weight class. His opponent was Chatri Suwanayod from Thailand. The 17-year-old Chen Yuan attacked aggressively from the start, scoring points repeatedly. Unfortunately, he was too aggressive and lacked experience. Just before the end of the first round, his opponent spotted a gap in his defense and landed a right hook, knocking him to the ground. The referee then stopped the match according to the rules.

In the subsequent 57-kilogram weight class preliminary match, China's Zuo Quan faced South Korea's Lee Hun. The 21-year-old Lee Hun had already made a name for himself three years ago, winning multiple international medals, while Zuo Quan had only started boxing two years prior. The difference in their skills was evident, and Zuo Quan lost with a score of 17 to 43. Coach Wang Guoyuan told the reporter that the losses in today's two matches were expected and would not affect the morale of the young Chinese team. He revealed that their breakthrough in this competition would come in the heavier weight classes.

A total of 12 preliminary matches were held today in the 48 to 67 kilogram weight classes. In addition to the South Korean boxers, winners also included boxers from Thailand, North Korea, the Philippines, and Mongolia. Tomorrow, the preliminary matches in these weight classes will continue.

    第14届亚洲拳击锦标赛在京拉开战幕
    本报北京7月23日讯　记者缪鲁报道：今天，在第14届亚洲业余拳击锦标赛首轮预赛中，东道主中国队出师不利，出阵的两名年轻选手均被淘汰。实力雄厚的南朝鲜队有3人亮相，结果全线告捷。
    在今天的比赛中，中国队首先登场的是54公斤级选手陈渊，他的对手是泰国的查特里·苏万纳亚德。17岁的陈渊如初生之犊，一上来就逼近对手频频进攻，连续得点。可惜他勇猛有余，经验不足，在第一局结束前，对手看准他的防守漏洞，一记右摆拳将他击倒在地。裁判遂按规则，宣布中止比赛。
    在随后进行的57公斤级首场预赛中，中国的左权与南朝鲜的李勋打满了三局。21岁的李勋早在3年前就已成名，多次获国际赛事奖牌，而左权两年前才初登拳坛，两人实力相差较大，最后，左权以17点比43点失利。中国队教练王国均告诉记者，首日两场比赛的失利本在预料之中，不会影响年轻的中国队的军心士气，他透露说，在这届比赛中，他们的突破点定在大级别角逐里。
    今天共进行了48至67公斤级的12场预赛，获胜者除南朝鲜选手外，还有泰国、朝鲜、菲律宾和蒙古的拳手。明天将继续进行这几个级别的预赛。
