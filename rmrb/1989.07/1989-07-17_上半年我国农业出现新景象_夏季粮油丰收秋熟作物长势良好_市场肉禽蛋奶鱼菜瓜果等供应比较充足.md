	New scenery has emerged in China's agriculture in the first half of the year. Summer grain and oil crops have been harvested, and autumn crops are growing well. It is estimated that the nationwide grain crop planting area will increase by 15 million mu compared to last year. Livestock and aquaculture production continues to grow, and the supply of meat, poultry, eggs, milk, fish, vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural products in urban and rural markets is relatively abundant. Since the beginning of summer, there have been more natural disasters such as heavy rain and pests. Under the inspiration of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, various levels of leadership have redoubled their efforts to fight against disasters and strive to achieve a bumper harvest for the year, increasing the effective supply to the market.

	During the rectification and adjustment period, various levels of leadership have taken effective measures this year to strengthen agriculture. The support for agriculture by relevant departments has been enhanced, and measures have been strengthened. The state has raised the procurement prices for grain, cotton, and oil, further stimulating farmers' production enthusiasm, increasing investment, and actively adopting advanced agricultural science and technology. The rural economic situation is active and prosperous, which is rare in recent years.

	The production situation for grain, cotton, and oil is promising. The summer grain and oil crops have basically been harvested. According to preliminary statistics, the total production of summer grain, mainly wheat, has increased by 2.5 billion kilograms compared to last year, which may reach a historical high. Oilseed rape has achieved a bumper harvest, increasing by nearly 20% compared to last year. The planting area for early rice, spring-sown, and summer-sown grain crops has increased. Hainan's early rice production has increased by 100 million kilograms, and the summer corn in the Huang-Huai-Hai region and the spring wheat in the northern region, totaling more than 40 million mu, are growing well. The cotton planting area has reached 78 million mu, although it has decreased compared to last year, it has increased compared to the original planned area, and the growth in most places is also good.

	The implementation of the "Vegetable Basket Project" has received great attention from local leaders, especially mayors of large and medium-sized cities, who have invested a lot of manpower, financial resources, and materials, achieving remarkable results. Compared to the same period last year, pork has increased by 4%, mutton by 9%, and fish by 5%. The stock of pork and eggs in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai is ample. The supply of subsidiary food products in urban and rural areas is abundant, the proportion of leafy vegetables has increased, the level of balanced supply has improved, and the supply and sales of fruits are both prosperous. The total fruit production for the year is expected to exceed last year, reaching about 15 million tons.

	Township enterprises are strictly implementing national industrial policies to adjust structures and control development speeds. A batch of enterprises with poor benefits, environmental pollution, and competition with large enterprises for raw materials and energy have been or are being closed or transformed. The growth rate is gradually decreasing in a reasonable manner. Farmers who have returned from cities or been laid off from enterprises are guided to enter enterprises with good benefits, relying on science and technology to adjust industrial and product structures, maintaining a reasonable development momentum for township enterprises, or guiding them towards agricultural regional development and high-yield development.

    上半年我国农业出现新景象
    夏季粮油丰收秋熟作物长势良好
    市场肉禽蛋奶鱼菜瓜果等供应比较充足
    本报北京7月6日讯　记者肖俊熙从农业部获悉：今年上半年，我国农业发展出现了新的景象。夏季粮油丰收；秋熟作物长势良好，预计全国粮食作物播种面积比去年增加1500万亩；畜牧、水产持续增长，城乡市场肉、禽、蛋、奶、鱼、菜、瓜果等农副产品供应比较充足。入夏以来暴雨病虫等自然灾害较多，各级领导在四中全会精神鼓舞下，再接再厉，奋力抗灾，力争夺取全年农业丰收，增加市场的有效供给。
    在治理整顿中，今年各级领导采取有效措施，切实加强农业；有关部门支农观念增强，措施有力；国家提高粮、棉、油收购价格，进一步调动了农民的生产积极性，增加投入，积极采用先进农业科学技术。农村经济形势活跃繁荣，为近年少有。
    粮棉油生产形势喜人。夏季粮油已基本收打完毕，据初步统计，以小麦为主的夏粮总产比上年增产25亿公斤，可创历史最高水平，油菜获得比去年增产近2成的丰收。早稻、春播和夏播粮食作物播种面积增加，海南早稻增产1亿公斤，黄淮海地区1亿亩创高产的夏玉米和北方4000多万亩春小麦长势很好。棉花播种面积达7800万亩，虽比去年减少，但比原预计面积增加，多数地方长势也较好。
    “菜篮子工程”的实施，受到各地领导尤其是大中城市市长的极大重视，投入了较多的人、财、物力，取得十分显著的效果。与去年同期相比，猪肉增长4％，羊肉增长9％、鱼增长5％。京、津、沪三大市的猪肉、禽蛋库存充足。全国城乡副食品供应充足，细菜比重增加，均衡供应水平提高，瓜果供销两旺，全年水果总产量预计将超过去年，达1500万吨左右。
    乡镇企业按照国家产业政策狠抓结构调整和控制发展速度。一批效益差、污染环境和与大企业争原材料、能源的企业已经或正在关停并转；增长速度逐月合理下降。转下来和从城市回乡的农民或被引导转入效益好的企业，依靠科学技术调整产业和产品结构，保持乡镇企业合理发展势头，或被引向农业区域开发和高产开发。
    农业丰收是关系稳定全局的大事，要夺取全年农业丰收，还要做许多扎扎实实的工作。
