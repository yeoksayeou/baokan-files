The British newspaper *The Times* recently published an article discussing the increase in juvenile crime in the United States. The summary is as follows:

If you ask New York Governor Mario Cuomo what the greatest threat to the United States is, he would certainly say, "The lack of imparting values to the young." Cuomo is one of the most influential Democrats. He attributes the increasing violence and ignorance to the fact that families, schools, churches, and the government have not imparted a set of values or standards for distinguishing right from wrong. He said, "This is the cause of drug abuse, crime, teenage pregnancies, and even economic problems."

When figures from President Bush to activist Jesse Jackson are all looking for ways to address what is seen as a potential threat to the survival of the United States as a superpower, this old tune has reached a crescendo.

Now, people increasingly feel that the United States is facing a social crisis. The rate of juvenile violent crimes is rising sharply, and the incidence of rape among boys under fifteen has doubled in two years.

Recent horrific cases have made it clear that the rise in crime rates is not just a product of the most severely afflicted and expanding inner-city communities of black "underclass," but the rate of juvenile violent crimes in white suburban areas is also rising.

Experts believe that this situation is caused by many factors, but most of them blame the weakening of moral values and the lack of self-discipline instilled by parents and schools.

The television and popular music that have a significant impact on American youth now promote materialism in a more explicit form than a generation ago.

For example, an average American child, by the age of sixteen, has witnessed approximately 200,000 acts of violence on television. Slavery, rape, and murder have become themes in popular music.

Seven million teenagers, or one-quarter of American children aged ten to seventeen, are at risk of being influenced by drugs, alcohol, unprotected sex at a young age, and other behaviors.

    美国面临的社会危机
    英国《泰晤士报》最近刊登一篇文章，谈美国青少年犯罪增多问题，摘要如下：
    如果你问纽约州长马里奥·科莫，什么是对美国最大的威胁，他肯定会说：“没有对年轻人传授价值观念。”
    科莫是最有影响的民主党人之一。他把暴力和愚昧行为不断增加归咎于家庭、学校、教会和政府没有传授一套价值观念，或者没有传授辨别是非的标准。他说，这就是“吸毒、犯罪、十来岁的少女怀孕、甚至是经济问题的原因”。
    当从布什总统到杰西·杰克逊牧师这样的活动家，人人都在寻找办法，对付被看作是可能危及美国作为超级大国的生存的故障时，这种老调达到了高潮。
    现在，人们越来越强烈地感到美国正面临着一个社会危机。青少年暴力犯罪率急剧上升，十五岁以下男孩的强奸案发案率两年中增加了一倍。
    最近一些可怖的案件使人们清楚地认识到，犯罪率上升不仅仅是社会病态最严重的、范围不断扩大的内城社区里黑人“下层阶级”的产物，白人居住的郊区的青少年暴力犯罪率也在不断上升。
    专家们认为这种情况的造成，有很多因素，但大部分因素都归咎于道德观念淡薄和家长与学校没有培养一种自我约束的观念。
    对美国青少年有巨大影响的电视和流行音乐现在所宣扬的物质主义的形式比一个世代之前露骨得多。
    例如，一个普通美国儿童长到十六岁时，他已从电视上见过了大约二十万起暴力行为。奴役、强奸和凶杀成了通俗流派流行歌曲的主题。
    七百万青少年，即美国四分之一的十岁至十七岁的儿童处在毒品、酒类、在早龄时期就发生无防护性关系和其他行动的影响的危险之中。
