In February, the *Xinmin Evening News* reported that despite repeated crackdowns, fortune-telling with playing cards had resurfaced on the streets of Shanghai, attracting many passersby. On March 5, the *China Youth Daily* reported that Chengdu had openly established a "fortune-telling street," with graduates from key universities' philosophy departments organizing amateur divination salons. On March 25, the *People's Daily* reported that fortune-tellers in Shenyang had formed a professional organization, with apprenticeship and mentorship practices emerging. On April 1, the *Literary Gazette* reported that many publishers were not willing to be left out of this fortune-telling craze, rushing to publish books on "destiny and physiognomy," truly seeking knowledge in "destiny and physiognomy"! Even more puzzling is that in many places, computers are now openly set up to provide the "most advanced, most scientific" computer fortune-telling services, even boasting the banner of "scientific fortune-telling." Why has this fortune-telling craze been able to spread so rampantly under the current conditions? Why has this phenomenon, which even enlightened individuals in capitalist societies find "incomprehensible," been able to spread so rapidly here?

In reality, whether it is foreign "foreign" diviners or Chinese "native" fortune-tellers, whether it is traditional physiognomy, palmistry, Yi Jing, or today's computer playing cards "scientific fortune-telling," there is not a shred of scientific basis, and they can only resort to some deceptive tricks. The reason they are still so popular is that some people's spiritual world is extremely empty. In order to find a spiritual anchor, they can only turn to the illusory god of fate for blessings. When people lack a strong spiritual pillar in their thoughts, lack a firm belief and dedication to the country and the cause, their gaze will inevitably be fixed on a small area right in front of them, always trying to plan for the good or bad fortune of their future. Once they fall into this vicious cycle of only caring about their own interests, they are particularly susceptible to the nonsense of fortune-tellers, not to mention that "scientific fortune-telling" adds a bit of deceptive "scientific" basis! Therefore, all fortune-tellers throughout history have used every means to make you sink deeper and deeper into the cycle of only caring about personal interests. It is said that Emperor Taizong of the Tang Dynasty once asked Master Yixing about the lifespan of the Tang Dynasty, and Yixing presented the "Leaf Child Pattern." The traditional Chinese character "叶" (leaf) and "子" (child) combined together form "二十世李" (twenty generations of Li), predicting the dynasty's longevity for 20 generations. Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty consulted with Xie Shi, who wrote a "问" (question) character. This Xie Shi was quite cunning, saying something like "right is the ruler, left is the ruler, the sage will reign for ten thousand years." The traditional Chinese character "问" split into two parts can be vaguely seen as two "君" (ruler) characters. Today, those who visit "scientific fortune-telling" may not have the same questions as Emperor Taizong and Emperor Huizong, but in the eyes of the fortune-tellers, the visitors' mindset is no different. This tells us that if, in a society filled with people who do not care about the country, the collective, or the cause but only care about their own fate, it would be a pipe dream to make fortune-tellers unemployed.

Our socialist spiritual civilization construction has been neglected for too long, and our ideological and political work has become too weak! From the spread of "scientific fortune-telling," we see the severe fact that people lack a strong spiritual pillar. Strengthening education in patriotism, socialism, and national pride is urgently needed. It is time to take concrete measures to strengthen ideological and political work!

    “科学算命”的背后
    王向东
    今年2月19日《新民晚报》说，在上海“几经打扫的街头”又冒出了“算命扑克”，“行人争相驻足”；3月5日《中国青年报》说，成都公然出现了“算命一条街”，毕业于重点大学哲学系的学士竟然组织了“业余卜卦沙龙”；3月25日《人民日报》说，沈阳的“算命先生已形成一种行业组织”，“出现招徒拜师现象”；4月1日《文艺报》说，不少出版社在这股算命热中不甘寂寞，竞相出版“命相学”书籍，真是“求知求到‘命相学’”！更令人纳闷的是，不少地方现在公开摆出一台台电脑，开展“最先进的、最科学的”电脑算命服务，竟然打出了“科学算命”的旗号。为什么这股算命热能够在现在的气候条件下如此猖獗地“热”起来？为什么这种连资本主义社会的有识之士也认为是“不可思议的现象”却能够在我们这里如此迅速地蔓延开来？
    其实，无论是外国的“洋”占卜者，还是中国的“土”算命先生，无论是传统的面相手相六爻八卦，还是今天的电脑扑克“科学算命”，都没有丝毫科学依据，都只能是玩弄一些骗人的伎俩。他们所以还十分行时，原因就在于有些人精神世界十分空虚，他们为了寻求一种寄托，只能向虚幻的命运之神乞求保佑。当人们在思想上缺少强大的精神支柱，缺少一种对祖国对事业的坚定信念和献身精神的时候，其眼光必然盯在鼻尖下面的一小块地方，总是千方百计地为自己的前途的吉凶而筹划。一旦跌进这种只关心自己利益的怪圈之中，就特别容易相信算命先生的胡说八道，更何况“科学算命”还多了一点迷惑人的所谓“科学”依据！因而，古往今来所有的算命先生都使出浑身解数，让你在只关心个人利益的怪圈之中越陷越深。传说唐太宗曾向一行禅师问唐朝存国的年数，一行进献了“叶子格”，繁体字的“葉”与“子”分合起来就是“二十世李”，预报了传国20代。宋徽宗向谢石问卜，写了一个“问”字，这个谢石就滑头得很，说什么“右为君，左为君，圣人万岁”。一个繁体字的“问”字左右拆开，勉强可以看作是两个“君”字。今天光顾“科学算命”的人虽然问卜的内容不再与唐太宗宋徽宗雷同，但是，在算命先生眼里，光顾者的心态却并没有什么两样。这就告诉我们，如果在充斥着对祖国、对集体、对事业不关心而只关心自己的命运吉凶的人群里，要使算命先生失业，只能是天方夜谭。
    我们的社会主义精神文明建设被放松得太久了，我们的思想政治工作薄弱到了不能再薄弱的程度了！从“科学算命”的蔓延，我们看到了人们缺少强大的精神支柱的严峻事实。加强爱国主义、社会主义和民族自尊心的教育，确属刻不容缓。采取切切实实加强思想政治工作的措施，是时候了！
