Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 11th.

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation stated today that since its establishment in 1987, the China Working Group of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) has been progressing steadily and normally. At the seventh meeting held in April this year, the review and assessment of China's foreign trade system were completed.

The spokesperson pointed out that the eighth meeting of the working group, originally scheduled for July 11th to 13th, was to begin negotiations and drafting work on the protocol for restoring China's contracting party status. Recently, following the suggestion of the chairman of the working group and after consultations, it was decided to appropriately postpone this meeting. The Chinese side has agreed to this postponement, which is purely a procedural issue.

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation stated that reform and opening up is China's long-term basic state policy. China's participation in the world multilateral trading system is a component of implementing this policy. Restoring China's contracting party status in the GATT at an early date is in the interests of all parties. It is hoped that the eighth meeting of the China Working Group will be held in September this year as suggested in the consultations. The Chinese delegation has made full preparations for this.

    经贸部发言人谈话指出
    恢复我关贸总协定地位工作进展正常
    推迟本月谈判完全是一个程序问题
    本报北京7月11日讯　记者梅洪如报道：经贸部发言人今天发表谈话指出，关贸总协定中国工作组自1987年成立以来，工作一直稳步、正常，在今年4月第七次会议上，已完成对中国外贸制度的审议和评估。
    发言人指出，原定于本月11日至13日召开第八次工作组会议，开始恢复中国缔约国地位议定书的谈判和起草工作，最近根据该工作组主席的建议，经过磋商决定，将这次会议日期适当推迟，对此，我方已同意。这种推迟完全是一个工作程序问题。
    经贸部发言人指出，改革开放是中国长期坚持的基本国策，中国参与世界多边贸易体制是执行这一体制的组成部分，早日恢复中国在关贸总协定的缔约国地位符合各方利益。希望中国工作组第八次会议按磋商中的有关建议于今年9月举行。中国代表团已为此作好充分准备。
