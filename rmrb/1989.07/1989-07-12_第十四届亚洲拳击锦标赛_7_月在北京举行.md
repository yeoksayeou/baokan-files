The 14th Asian Boxing Championship will be held in Beijing from July 23 to July 29. This is the first international sports competition to be held in Beijing since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

This competition is organized by the Chinese Boxing Association on behalf of the International Amateur Boxing Association (AIBA) and is the first official international boxing event to be held in China. Originally scheduled to begin on June 25, the event has been postponed. This competition will play an important role in improving the level of boxing in China, promoting the development of boxing in Asia, and preparing for the Asian Games to be held in Beijing next year. The organizing committee has been established, and preparations are underway.

Currently, 13 countries and regions, including India, Iraq, Japan, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, Nepal, Pakistan, Palestine, the Philippines, Syria, Thailand, and China, have registered to participate. The final participation of Hong Kong, Indonesia, Laos, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Chinese Taipei is yet to be confirmed.

This championship will feature 12 weight classes and will follow the rules set by the AIBA. For the first time, electronic scoring systems will be used for judging.

During the competition, the AIBA Council meeting will be held in Beijing, and an international boxing referee training class will be organized. The AIBA has designated boxing experts from Pakistan and Thailand to conduct assessments from July 18 to July 21. Chairman Chaudhry and other leaders of the AIBA will come to guide and observe the competition.
