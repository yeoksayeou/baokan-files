Farmers in Lanxi City, with high enthusiasm, have developed and utilized 15,000 mu of barren hills and beaches over the past two years, with the newly increased land area equivalent to six times the construction land during the same period. This meaningful change stems from the incentive policy of "who develops, who benefits." Farmers participating in the new land development can all obtain substantial benefits supported by the government.

Such changes, like those in Lanxi City, have become quite common in Zhejiang Province. In just two years, the province has basically controlled the trend of sharp decrease in arable land. The province has newly created 372,000 mu of arable land, gardens, and other agricultural land, excluding construction land, with the newly created land exceeding the used land by 112,400 mu. According to this year's land creation and use plan, another 25,000 mu of agricultural land can be increased.

From 1984 to 1986, the construction land in Zhejiang Province was once out of control, with arable land decreasing by 400,000 mu each year. Starting from 1987, the province mobilized governments at all levels to control construction land with a sense of historical responsibility, effectively increasing the creation of new arable land. They included the suppression of arable land reduction, the increase of land creation area, and the maintenance of the balance of land use and creation in the target management responsibility system of governments at all levels. In 1987, in the non-agricultural construction land occupation plan index issued by the state, Zhejiang Province strictly reviewed and controlled the "pen protection of land," saving 15,000 mu of arable land. In 1988, it saved 27.5% of the planned arable land occupation index.

Zhejiang Province has vigorously developed arable land resources. To raise funds for land reclamation, the province collects land creation fees from land users and subsidizes farmers to create land. After implementing the principle of "creating two mu for every one mu used" nationwide, the province mobilized various places to formulate a series of reasonable preferential policies, including determining land development, use, inheritance, and transfer rights, exempting new arable land from increased grain procurement tasks and agricultural taxes for five years, injecting agricultural development funds, supporting farmers in developing land, prioritizing the supply of land creation materials at planned prices, and providing land creation technology services free of charge. These policies have encouraged collectives and individuals to contract land creation.

### 浙江耕地锐减趋势得控制  新增造地面积超建设用地

    浙江耕地锐减趋势得控制  新增造地面积超建设用地
    本报杭州7月2日电　记者高海浩报道：兰溪市热情高涨的农民，在过去的两年中开发利用荒坡荒滩1.5万亩，新增造地面积相当于同期建设用地的6倍。这种富有意义的变化，源自“谁开发谁受益”的激励政策，参加新造田地的农户均能获得政府扶持的可观收益。
    像兰溪市这样的变化，在浙江省已经较为普遍。在短短两年间，这个省基本控制了耕地锐减的趋势，全省新造耕地、园地等农用地37.2万亩，除去建设用地，造地超过用地11.24万亩。按今年的造地和用地计划，又能新增农用地2.5万亩。
    1984年至1986年间，浙江省建设用地一度失控，每年减少耕地达40万亩。从1987年起，该省动员各级政府以历史的责任感全面控制建设用地，有效增造新造耕地。他们把抑制耕地减少、增加造地面积、保持用地与造地总量平衡列入各级政府目标管理责任制。1987年，在国家下达的非农业建设占用耕地计划指标中，浙江省严格审批把关，“笔下保地”，少占耕地1.5万亩，1988年又节余计划占用耕地指标27.5％。
    浙江省大力开发宜农土地资源。为了筹集土地垦造资金，向用地者收取造地费，补助农民造地，这个省在全国率先实行“用一亩造二亩”的原则之后，动员各地先后制订了包括确定土地开发使用权、继承权和转让权，新造耕地5年内不增加粮食征购任务、免交农业税，投放农业发展基金，扶持农民开发土地，国家优先平价供应造地物资，无偿提供造地技术服务等一系列合理优惠政策，激励集体和个人承包造地。
