    This summer's procurement of agricultural and sideline products has seen a balanced supply of funds, with the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) issuing a total of 55.76 billion yuan in procurement loans from January to June, an increase of 4.99 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. As of now, there have been virtually no instances of issuing "white tickets."

    To secure funds for this year's summer harvest, various levels of the ABC and credit cooperatives, under the leadership of local governments and in collaboration with relevant departments, conducted early investigations, early accounting, and early implementation. They explored multiple channels and vigorously organized deposits. By the end of June, the ABC's savings deposits increased by 12.46 billion yuan, an increase of 3.69 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, surpassing the full-year deposit growth target half a year ahead of schedule. They strictly controlled the indicators for various directive loans within the planned scope. By the end of the first half of the year, the balance of loans to township and village enterprises by the bank and credit cooperatives increased by 4.67 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, a decrease of 9.88 billion yuan compared to the same period last year, thereby increasing the sources of procurement funds.

    Ma Yongwei stated that preliminary estimates indicate that in the second half of this year, due to factors such as increased production and higher procurement prices, the demand for procurement funds will correspondingly increase, and the financial situation remains very severe. Currently, the ABC is working closely with various relevant departments to urgently organize and allocate funds in preparation for the peak autumn harvest season.

    今年夏收基本无“白条”
    秋收资金形势仍很严峻
    本报西宁7月17日电　记者江夏报道：中国农业银行行长马永伟今天在这里对记者说，今年夏季农副产品收购资金供应比较平衡，1—6月，农行累计发放收购贷款557.6亿元，比去年同期多放49.9亿元。到目前为止，基本上没有出现打“白条”现象。
    为了筹集今年的夏收资金，各级农行和信用社在当地政府的领导和有关部门的配合下，早调查、早算帐、早落实，多方设法，大力组织存款。到6月末，农行储蓄存款增加124.6亿元，比去年同期多增加36.9亿元，提前半年超额完成了全年增储计划；把各项指令性贷款指标严格控制在计划内，上半年行、社乡镇企业贷款余额比年初增加46.7亿元，比上年同期少增加98.8亿元，增加了收购资金的来源。
    马永伟说，据初步预测，今年下半年，由于产量增加、收购价格提高等因素的影响，收购资金需相应增加，资金形势仍十分严峻，目前，农行上下正与各有关部门密切配合，为秋收旺季的到来抓紧筹集调度资金。
