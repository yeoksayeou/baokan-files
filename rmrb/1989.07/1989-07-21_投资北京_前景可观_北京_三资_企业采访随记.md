Beijing's doors will open wider. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, Beijing's leaders have repeatedly emphasized: in utilizing foreign capital, we will ensure that contracts are executed without interruption, the construction of approved projects will continue without interruption, and the approval of new projects will continue without interruption. We hope that far-sighted foreign investors will continue to come to Beijing to invest.

In fact, many foreign investors in Beijing share this sentiment. During the days of turmoil in Beijing, letters expressing this wish from foreign investors kept arriving in Beijing.

"From China's ten years of open-door policy, we have felt that this government represents the interests of the vast majority of the Chinese people. Therefore, I can confidently say that the factors of turmoil will not become the mainstream of society." The words of Chen Baohui, general manager of the foreign-funded Three Star Company in Beijing, are quite representative. He clearly stated: not only will the order contracts be executed, but we will also rush to handle them, and the company will invest as much as needed.

Mr. Liang Jing, the foreign director of Beijing Jinding Hotel Co., Ltd., witnessed the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. During those days, the Chinese staff overcame various difficulties to come to work, and not a single person was absent or late. He expressed his heartfelt words: "How can we not work together?"

The Sino-American joint venture Beijing Jeep Automobile Co., Ltd. has created a historical high of producing an average of 140 vehicles per day since resuming production on June 8. This is truly a miracle. Mr. Swann, the American deputy chairman who is currently in the United States, sent a telegram saying: "I am very pleased to hear the news of resuming production, and we will continue to cooperate."

Officials from the Municipal Foreign Economic Commission solemnly told the reporter that as the situation stabilizes, the doubts of some foreign investors who came to Beijing for business negotiations have gradually been dispelled. The once quiet negotiation rooms of various foreign trade companies in Beijing have become lively again, with foreign investors coming and going to discuss business, sign contracts, and inspect goods. A company from the Federal Republic of Germany has already done a business worth more than $1.4 million with the Beijing Garment Import and Export Corporation. More encouragingly, out of the 150 letters and telegrams sent by the Beijing Municipal Foreign Trade Department to overseas, 130 have confirmed their commitment to contracts and continued trade cooperation. Businessmen from Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and the United States have also sent reports applying for expanded investment in projects under construction or already in production.

The capital, Beijing, has unique advantages in developing "three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, jointly-ventured, and cooperatively-operated). In recent years, Beijing has had 498 such enterprises with a total contract value of over $40 billion. From January to May this year, the industrial output value of Beijing's "three types of enterprises" reached 1.229 billion yuan, with a profit of 120 million yuan, which are 2.4 and 2.5 times those of the same period last year, respectively.

In the daily life of the capital's residents today, we can almost always see the results of utilizing foreign capital. However, the more profound significance lies in the change in the production mode of enterprises. The utilization of foreign capital has promoted the modernization of industries such as chemicals, building materials, medicine, food, automobiles, and machinery. It is on this basis that Beijing has formulated a "one-stop" plan for 18 key projects, including refrigerators, color printing machines, jeeps, and engineering plastics, from components, raw materials, key equipment, and technological processes to final products. Due to the smooth progress, the degree of localization of products is continuously improving. Among them, the localization rate of domestic cathode ray tube color televisions has reached 94%, and that of refrigerators has reached 85%. Just for the compressor castings, it saves more than $5 million in foreign exchange each year.

At the Beijing Jeep Automobile Co., Ltd., which was awarded the title of "Top Ten Best Joint Ventures in China," the reporter heard many stories about technological introduction, digestion, and absorption, as well as the transformation of old enterprises. This company is a joint venture between the Beijing Automobile Manufacturing Plant and the American Automobile Company. In the past five years, it has produced 120,000 vehicles and made a profit of 290 million yuan. The Chinese and American shareholders have begun to share the profits. After the turmoil and rebellion, can the joint venture continue? Many Chinese staff were concerned about this. However, the American side promptly approved the project application for the accelerated localization of components sent by the company and clearly proposed to continue the agenda for expanding the joint venture negotiations. Currently, all the American managers in various departments of the company have returned to Beijing. Vice President Ed arrived at the company and immediately went to the workshop to inspect production and understand the progress of the localization of components.

A Japanese businessman told the reporter: "I have been to many places in the world, but in China, I always have a feeling of returning home. Every time I go back to Japan, I don't say 'return,' but 'go'; when I come to China, I don't say 'come,' but 'return'..." This Japanese businessman is Mr. Asano Sadayasu, the general manager of Beijing Nanchang Food Machinery Co., Ltd.

Mr. Asano is very satisfied with his cooperation partners in Beijing. The Chinese side has sent excellent employees to the joint venture company and provided preferential treatment in water and electricity. The company's trial production lasted for two months, and the first batch of products was returned to the Japanese market. In terms of accommodation, considering that his enterprise in Japan is still a medium-sized one, in order to save costs, the Chinese cooperation partner built a guesthouse for experts near the company. Asano Sadayasu said: "The Chinese people are reliable friends."

With the gradual stabilization of the situation in Beijing, in early June, Mr. Zhai Shufen, the chairman of the Setar Grand Building, which provides office and accommodation services for foreign business communities in Beijing, promptly wrote to the business community representatives who had returned to their countries, and two vice managers also called some business community representatives who had temporarily left Beijing to introduce the gradually stabilizing situation in Beijing and hoped they would return soon.

Beijing, after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, is making multi-faceted efforts to develop an outward-looking economy.

    投资北京  前景可观
    ——北京“三资”企业采访随记
    本报记者  赵兴林
    “北京的大门会更敞开。”平息反革命暴乱之后，北京市领导多次重申：利用外资方面做到执行合同不停，已批准项目的建设不停，审批新项目不停。希望有远见的外商继续来北京投资。
    其实，不少来北京投资的外商也是这样想的。在北京发生动乱的日子里，一封封表达这种愿望的外商电函，不断地飞向北京。
      “从中国十年来的对外开放政策中，我们感到这个政权代表了中国绝大多数人的利益。因此，我可以断言，动乱因素不可能成为社会的主流。”外商在京独资企业——三立公司总经理陈白淮的这番话很有代表性。他明确表示：定货合同不仅要执行，而且还要抢时间办理，需要多少钱公司就投资多少。
    北京京鼎大酒店有限公司外方董事长梁敬先生，目睹北京发生反革命暴乱那几天，公司中方人员克服种种困难赶来上班，而且没有一个缺勤、迟到的，他道出了由衷之言：“我们怎能不同舟共济呢？”
    中美合资经营的北京吉普汽车有限公司，自六月八日恢复生产至今，创平均日产一百四十辆汽车的历史最高水平。这真是奇迹。正在美国的美方副董事长斯旺多发来电传说：“我非常高兴地听到重新生产的消息，我们要继续合作下去。”
    市外经委的同志郑重地告诉记者，随着局势的平稳，逐步打消了一些来京洽谈生意的外商疑虑。一度冷清的北京各外贸公司谈判间，又开始红火起来，谈生意、签合同、验货的外商络绎不绝。来自联邦德国的一家公司，已同北京服装进出口公司做成了一笔价值一百四十多万美元的生意。更可喜的是，由北京市外贸部门向海外发出的一百五十多封函电，已有一百三十多家明确回复信守合同，继续发展贸易合作。香港、台湾、日本、南朝鲜和美国的客商，也纷纷传递来扩大在建或已投产项目的投资申请报告。
    首都北京，发展“三资”企业有着得天独厚的优势。这几年，北京市“三资”企业达四百九十八个，协议总金额四十多亿美元。今年一至五月，北京市“三资”企业中工业产值达十二点二九亿元，盈利一点二亿元，分别是去年同期的二点四和二点五倍。
    在今日首都居民的生活中，我们几乎随时随地可以看到利用外资的成果。不过，意义更深远的还是企业生产方式的变化，利用外资促使化工、建材、医疗、食品、汽车、机械等行业，朝着现代化大工业生产迈进。正是在此基础上，北京市重点编制了电冰箱、彩色胶印机、吉普轿车、工程塑料等十八个项目，从零部件、原材料、关键设备和工艺技术，乃至最终产品的“一条龙”消化吸收计划。由于进展比较顺利，产品国产化率不断提高。其中国产显象管的彩色电视机国产化率达到百分之九十四，电冰箱国产化率达到百分之八十五，仅压缩机铸件一项，每年就节约外汇五百多万美元。
    记者在荣获“全国十大最佳合资企业”称号的北京吉普汽车有限公司，听到许多技术引进、消化、吸收，改造老企业的事迹。这个公司是由北京汽车制造厂与美国汽车公司合资经营的企业，五年来已生产十二万辆汽车，盈利二点九亿人民币，中美双方股东已开始分红。经受了动乱、暴乱的考验，合资经营能否继续下去？不少中方人员曾为此担心。但是，美方把公司已送去的加速国产化零部件项目申报计划及时批复回来，并明确提出继续进行扩大合资谈判议程。当前公司各部美方任职经理都陆续返回北京，副总经理艾德先生一到公司，就到车间检查生产，了解落实国产化零部件进展情况。
    一位日本企业家对记者说：“我到过世界很多地方，但是在中国却总有一种归故乡的感觉。我每次回日本，对人从不说‘回’，而是‘去’；来中国不说‘来’，而说‘回’……”。这位日本企业家就是北京南常肉食机械有限公司总经理浅野贞夫。
    浅野先生对北京的合作伙伴甚感满意。中方把优秀的员工输送到合资公司，在水、电等能源上给以优惠。公司试生产两个月，第一批产品就返销日本市场。在食宿方面，考虑到他在日本的企业尚属中小型，为了节省费用，中方合作伙伴就在公司附近修建起专家宿舍。浅野贞夫表示：“中国人民是可以信赖的朋友。”
    随着北京局势的日渐平稳，六月上旬，专门为外国驻京商社提供办公、住宿的赛特大厦公寓董事长翟书汾及时给已回国的商社代表写信，两位副经理也向暂时离京回国的一些商社代表挂电话，介绍北京日渐稳定的局势，希望他们早日归来。
    经过平息反革命暴乱后的北京，正在为发展外向型经济，作出多方面的努力。
