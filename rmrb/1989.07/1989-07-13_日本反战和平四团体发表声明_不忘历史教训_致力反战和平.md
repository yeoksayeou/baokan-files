Four Japanese anti-war and peace organizations recently issued a statement on the 52nd anniversary of the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident, expressing their commitment to remembering historical lessons and continuing to contribute to the cause of anti-war and peace.

The statement said, "The Lugou Bridge Incident is a painful page in Japan's history." From this, people can learn many lessons: aggression is doomed to fail; war brings what kind of disaster to the people; how much sacrifice the nation forces the people to make for war; what should be done for peace, and so on.

The statement pointed out that in Japan, there are still tendencies to not seriously learn from historical lessons, to not admit to invading China, and to glorify that war, which is extremely dangerous.

The four organizations are: the Association of Returnees from China, the Japan-China Peace and Friendship Association, the Japan-China Friendship Association of Former Soldiers, and the No-War Soldiers Association. The basic members of these organizations are former Japanese military personnel who participated in the invasion of China. Over the years, they have made active efforts for the cause of anti-war and peace.

The statement said, "We deeply regret the heavy losses of life and property and the spiritual suffering inflicted on the Chinese people by our invasion of China."

    日本反战和平四团体发表声明
    不忘历史教训　致力反战和平
    新华社东京7月12日电  日本4个反战和平团体最近就“七·七”卢沟桥事变52周年发表声明，表示不忘历史教训，继续为反战和平事业作出贡献。
    声明说，“卢沟桥事变对日本来说，是历史上痛苦的一页。”人们可从中学到许多教训：侵略必败；战争会给国民带来怎样的惨祸；国家因战争迫使国民付出多么大的牺牲；为了和平应当怎样做等等。
    声明指出，在日本，仍存在不认真汲取历史教训、不承认侵略过中国、美化那场战争的动向，这是极其危险的。
    这4个团体是：中国归还者联络会、日中和平友好会、日中友好旧军人会、不战士兵会。这些团体的基本成员均是参加过侵略中国的旧日本军官兵。长年来，他们为反战和平事业作出了积极的努力。
    声明说，“我们对侵略中国给中国人民造成的惨重的生命财产损害和精神痛苦深感抱歉。”
