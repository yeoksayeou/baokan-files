"The Baise Uprising" is a documentary-style revolutionary historical film, produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 60th anniversary of the Baise Uprising. Sixty years ago, Deng Xiaoping, then only 25 years old and in the prime of his life, came to Guangxi. Amidst the complex and changing situation, he displayed great talent and personally led this successful uprising, which created valuable experiences in united front work, military operations, and peasant movements. The film will present a panoramic view of this magnificent revolutionary historical scene, praising the Baise Uprising and the Party.

Some people say I am doing "mandated literature." I say this "mandate" must be followed, willingly! Could China have reached where it is today without the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee? Could it have done so without reform and opening up? No! Comrade Xiaoping is a great revolutionary, with courage, foresight, and a broad vision. I admire him from the bottom of my heart. The scriptwriter has provided us with a good foundation, depicting Comrade Xiaoping's character as a proletarian politician who "assesses the situation, seizes the opportunity, seeks truth from facts, and adapts to changing circumstances." This trait, like a red thread, runs through to this day. Therefore, making "The Baise Uprising" well is not just about reviewing a tumultuous historical period; it also has strong contemporary significance.

Filming historical themes is difficult; filming revolutionary historical themes is even more difficult; filming leaders is difficult; filming living leaders is even more difficult. If it's done poorly, it's not good; if it's done flatly, it's also not good. If the techniques are too new, emphasizing realism, some senior comrades may not accept it. If the techniques are too old, making it traditional and conservative, it will be difficult to meet the new modern aesthetic requirements, lacking the artistic charm to shock people. We must strive to meet the needs of audiences at different levels. We must seek survival in the gap between politics and art, and in the clever combination of history and reality, leaders and the masses, to break through. We must stand at a higher level today to summarize and grasp it. In fact, politically strong themes need to pay more attention to artistry. Only by focusing on art and quality can we demonstrate its political value and make the film more valuable to watch.

The film depicts the cross-section of Chinese history in Guangxi from June to December 1929, a "Qingming Along the River" during the Republic of China, where the Kuomintang (Chiang Kai-shek, Li Zongren's New Guangxi Clique), Yu Zuobai, Li Mingrui, Wang Jingwei's Reorganization Clique, and the Communist Party, five political forces, competed in Guangxi. We must portray this complex background to show Deng Xiaoping, his revolutionary courage and strategy, his pragmatic approach, and his spirit of daring to adapt to changing circumstances, leading the revolution to victory. We must "return the historical content to history" (Engels), making the film feel like it is from the historical period of 1929. The entire film should have a documentary framework, as the scriptwriter proposed: seeking truth and seeking resemblance. Within the 1929 documentary framework, we place a dramatic core, and at the same time, combine it with an epic style. We must shoot from an epic height, opening up in some places, with a grand and sweeping momentum. In other places, we must pay attention to detailed depictions, finely portraying the spiritual state and appearance of the characters. We must have both bold freehand brushwork and delicate fine brushwork. We must make the film concise and to the point, stopping while it's good. The original script is long, in two parts, but we will definitely shoot it as one part, not exceeding 11 reels. We must focus the content and ink on the main characters, using the method of "water receding to reveal the stones" to highlight the main theme.

The pace of the entire film should be fast and tight, with each part connected. The pace is the pulse of the film. In the process and flow, there should be ups and downs, suppressions and elevations, tightly grasping Deng Xiaoping's revolutionary struggle as the main line, making the film full of revolutionary passion. This film has many large scenes, especially the latter half starting from the Yungui Yangguan Wharf transporting weapons, the scenes should pursue grandeur, pursue solemnity, and be majestic. We must shoot the fervent peasant and military movements in Guangxi in 1929, like a long dragon, to better set the stage for the heroic figures. In the film, there are also some large scenes of the Kuomintang side, which is to better display the complex situation at that time. We must shoot large scenes well, for the era, for the characters, not just for the sake of shooting large scenes.

    《百色起义》导演设想
    陈家林
    《百色起义》是一部文献性的革命历史故事片，是为庆祝中华人民共和国成立40周年，纪念百色起义60周年而拍摄的。60年前年仅25岁、风华正茂的邓小平同志来到了广西，在风云突变错综复杂的形势下，雄才大展，亲自领导了这次在统战、兵运和农运方面都创造了宝贵经验的成功的起义。影片就是全景式地再现这幅壮丽的革命历史画卷，歌颂百色起义，歌颂党。
    有人说我搞“遵命文学”，我说此“命”必遵，心甘情愿！中国能走到今天，没有党的十一届三中全会行吗？没有改革开放行吗？不行！小平同志是一位伟大的革命家，他有魄力，有胆识，高瞻远瞩，我由衷敬佩。剧本作者给我们提供了一个较好的基础，写出了小平同志“审时度势，掌握时机，实事求是，随机应变”的无产阶级政治家的品格，一个马克思主义者的博大胸襟和韬略。而这一点像一条红线一直贯穿到了今天。因此，拍好《百色起义》不仅仅是在回顾一段波澜壮阔的历史，更有着强烈的现实意义。
    拍历史题材难，拍革命历史题材更难；拍领袖人物难，拍在世的领袖人物更难。搞过了不行，搞平了也不行。手法过新，比纪实性强，一些老前辈可能接受不了。手法旧，拍得传统保守，又难以满足新的现代审美要求，缺乏震撼人的艺术魅力。我们要力争满足多层次观众的需要，要在政治与艺术的夹缝中去求生存，在历史和现实、领袖人物和群众的巧妙结合上作文章，去突破。必须站在今天更高的角度来概括和把握。事实上，政治性很强的题材更需要注重艺术性，只有狠抓艺术、狠抓质量才能体现出它的政治价值，才能使影片有更高的观赏价值。
    影片表现了1929年6月至12月中国广西历史的横断面，是一幅“清明上河图”，是国民党蒋介石、李宗仁新桂系，俞作柏、李明瑞，汪精卫改组派，再加上共产党五种政治势力在广西的角逐。我们要在表现这个错综复杂的背景上表现邓小平，表现他的革命魄力和韬略，表现他实事求是，敢于随机应变，把革命引向胜利的精神。要把“历史的内容还给历史”（恩格斯语），拍出的影片要让人感到是1929年那个历史时期。整个影片要有一个纪实的框架，像编剧提出的那样：以实求是，以实求似。在1929年纪实框架里放上戏剧性的内核，同时要把它和史诗性的风格结合起来。我们要站在史诗的高度去拍，有的地方要放得开，气势磅礴大江东去，浩浩荡荡一泻千里。有的地方又要注意细节刻画，对人物的精神状态和面貌作细腻的描绘，既要有豪放的写意泼墨，又要有细微的重彩工笔。我们要把影片拍得短小精悍，见好就收。原剧本较长，是上下两集，我们坚决拍成一集，不超过11本。要集中篇幅和笔墨烘托主要人物形象，用“水落石出”的办法，突出主干。
    全片的节奏要快，要紧凑，环环相扣。节奏是影片的脉搏，在进程中，在流动中要有起有伏，有抑有扬，要紧紧把握住邓小平的革命斗争为贯穿线，使影片充满革命的激情。这部影片有不少大场面，尤其是邕江洋关码头运军火开始的后半部，场面要追求大，追求凝重，气势恢宏。要拍出1929年广西农运、兵运如火如荼气贯长虹的声势，更好地烘托这个背景下的英雄人物。在影片中，拍国民党方面也有一些大场面，那是为了更好地展现当时复杂错综的局势。要拍好大场面，这是为了时代，为了人物，而不是为拍大场面而拍大场面。
