Title: On "Hoodlum Attitude"

"Hoodlum attitude" refers to the demeanor of a hoodlum. A hoodlum must have a hoodlum attitude; this is obvious. However, those who exhibit a hoodlum attitude, such as those who like to stir up trouble, wander around aimlessly, and cause disturbances, are not necessarily all hoodlums. But if someone consistently displays a hoodlum attitude, it is hard to say whether they will eventually become a hoodlum.

On the street, if two people suddenly start arguing over something, you will see that within a short time, a crowd will gather, layer upon layer, surrounding the scene. Those with a hoodlum attitude will join in the excitement or take the opportunity to shout; in public places, if something small goes wrong (such as a movie being interrupted or a microphone not working during a performance), there will immediately be loud whistles and jeers. Some people will even use vulgar language, cursing and complaining...

Every time I see such situations, I shake my head in disappointment. I always feel that these people are spiritually empty, as if they have nothing better to do. They seem to feel unfulfilled unless they can stir up some trouble and make a big fuss. I really don't understand the mindset of these people. Do they know how harmful this bad habit is to themselves?

Having a hoodlum attitude involves both personal quality and education, as well as social environment issues. If the social environment is good, even if some people have a hoodlum attitude, it is difficult for it to become widespread. If the social environment has problems, those with a hoodlum attitude will thrive. In May and June of this year, during the turmoil and riots in Beijing, these people became active. They had nothing to do with the situation, nor did they understand what was happening, but they still had to join in the fun. It seemed that if they didn't go out and shout, they wouldn't feel right. Some of those with a full-blown hoodlum attitude were deceived by a few instigators of the turmoil and riots. They followed along, spreading rumors, shouting reactionary slogans, blocking and smashing cars, and thus breaking the law and committing crimes. This is truly a tragic thing. Relevant departments have conducted a survey, and many young people who have turned to crime have done so because of their hoodlum attitude.

It is tragic that some people with a hoodlum attitude do not see it as a shame and do not try to correct it. Instead, they take pride in it, thinking it is a kind of heroic spirit. The saying goes, "It's not scary to make a mistake, but it's scary not to know you've made one." A hoodlum attitude is a sign of extremely poor upbringing and is a manifestation of ignorance and backwardness. If a person is infected with a hoodlum attitude, it is not good for them. Over time, they will truly become hoodlums, committing crimes or making mistakes, and will not gain any benefits from the positive side; if a city or a country has many people with a hoodlum attitude, that city or country will suffer.

A person with ambition, a sense of justice, and national pride, a proud Chinese citizen, will not have a hoodlum attitude. Those who have a hoodlum attitude lack exactly this ambition and sense of pride. I advise those with a hoodlum attitude to learn from the good comrades around them, improve their personal cultivation, and get rid of this bad habit. This will be of great benefit to them for the rest of their lives.

    说“痞气”
    郝湛秋
    “痞气”者，痞子之气也。痞子必有痞气，这是不用说的。但染有痞气者，比如喜欢起哄、乱串、滋事等，也未必都能说是痞子。只是长期有这种痞气的人，是不是会演变成痞子，这就难说了。
    在街上，突然有两个人因为点什么而吵嘴，你看吧，不一会看热闹的人就会里三层外三层地围个水泄不通，一些有痞气的人，就在旁助兴，或者乘机吆喝；在公共场合，如果偶然出点小毛病（或放映电影片子断了，或文艺演出话筒不响了），马上就会出现非常刺耳的口哨声、起哄声，有的口出污言，骂骂咧咧……
    每每见了这些情况，我都摇头唉叹。总觉得这种人精神太空虚了，好像没有什么正经事可干，遇到可以起哄的事由，不哄它一下，把事情哄大就不过瘾，就憋得慌。真不知道这些人是什么心态，他们是否知道这种坏毛病对自己的危害？
    染上痞气，有个人素质和修养问题，也有社会环境问题。社会环境好，尽管有些人有些痞气，也难以形成气候。如果社会环境发生问题，这种患有痞气的人，就会如鱼得水。今年五六月份，在北京发生动乱和暴乱之时，这种人就来劲了。本来没自己什么事，更没弄清是怎么回事，可非要凑个热闹不可，似乎不跟着上街转转，起起哄，心里就不舒服。有个别痞气十足的，正是因为上了少数动乱和暴乱策动者的当，跟着起哄，传谣，喊反动口号，拦车、砸车而触犯了法律，走上了犯罪道路。这实在是一件可悲的事情。有关部门作过一次统计，很多走上犯罪道路的青年，一个重要原因就是由痞气引发的。
    可悲的是，有些痞气患者不把有这种痞气当耻辱，加以改正，反而自以为荣耀，自以为是一种英雄之气。常言讲，不怕有错，就怕不知错。痞气，是一种极没修养的表现，是一种愚昧、落后的行为。一个人沾染了痞气，对自己来说不是一件什么好事，时间久了，真成了痞子，不是犯罪，就是犯错误，总不会从正面得到什么益处；一个城市、一个国家患有痞气的人多了，这个城市、这个国家就要遭灾。
    一个有上进心的人，一个有正义感和民族自尊心的人，一个自豪的中国公民，是不会有这种痞气的。有这种痞气的人，缺乏的也正是这种上进心和自豪感。我劝这些有痞气的人，多学学自己周围那些好同志，加强自身修养，改掉这种坏习惯，这对自己终生都将有极大的益处。
