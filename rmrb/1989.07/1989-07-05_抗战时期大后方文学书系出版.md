Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th.

In just two years, the Chongqing Publishing House has completed the 20-volume, 12-million-word series "Chinese Literature from the Rear Area During the War of Resistance Against Japan." Today, veterans of the former Central South Bureau of the Communist Party of China, along with a group of literary figures, publishers, party historians, and journalists from the capital, gathered to celebrate the publication of this series of anti-Japanese war literature.

This series is a testament to a history of iron and fire, a poetry of blood and tears. It truthfully records the heinous crimes committed by Japanese fascists in China during the War of Resistance Against Japan. It will play an active role in preserving literary materials, promoting the tradition of realistic literature, and educating future generations in patriotism.

The series includes nearly a thousand authors and more than ten thousand works. The entire series is divided into 10 sections and 20 volumes, covering essays and miscellaneous writings, novels, reportage literature, drama, and poetry.
