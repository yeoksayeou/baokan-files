Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, held a press conference this morning to brief domestic and foreign journalists on China's economic development in the first half of the year. He said that although the first half of the year was seriously disrupted by social unrest in some regions and the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, due to the efforts of cadres at all levels, the broad masses of workers and peasants who remained at their posts, worked hard, and seriously implemented the policies of rectification and reform, China's economy maintained a stable development momentum. This is mainly reflected in the following areas:

	— Summer crops achieved a bumper harvest. Preliminary statistics show that the total output of summer grain nationwide will exceed 93 million tons, an increase of over 2 million tons compared to last year, making it another year of bumper harvest. The summer harvest of rapeseed was over 5.5 million tons, an increase of over 500,000 tons compared to last year.

	— Industrial production maintained a relatively appropriate development speed. In the first half of the year, the total industrial output value nationwide reached 639.6 billion yuan, an increase of 10.8% compared to the same period last year, a decrease of 6.4 percentage points in the growth rate. Since March, energy production has rebounded quickly, with the total primary energy consumption in the first half of the year reaching 476.32 million tons, an increase of 5.9% compared to the same period last year. The production of major raw materials has also reversed the significant decline at the beginning of the year, with production gradually increasing. The production of basic daily consumer goods has accelerated month by month, increasing market supply.

	— The scale of fixed asset investment has begun to shrink, and the number of new projects has significantly decreased. In the first five months, the total fixed asset investment completed by state-owned enterprises was 44.2 billion yuan, a decrease of 7.1% compared to the same period last year; the number of new projects with an investment of over 50,000 yuan decreased by 73.6%.

	— The sharp increase in market retail prices has been somewhat curbed, and commodity sales have been relatively stable. Prices of major staple foods such as meat, poultry, eggs, and vegetables have been relatively stable, reversing the sharp increase last year. It is estimated that the total retail sales of social commodities in the first half of the year will reach over 410 billion yuan, an increase of about 20% compared to the same period last year, lower than the 24.6% increase in the same period last year.

	— Foreign economic development continues, and the scale of utilizing foreign capital has further expanded. In the first six months, the total value of imports and exports through customs reached $50.3 billion, an increase of 16.9% compared to the same period last year. The number of newly approved foreign-invested projects nationwide in the first five months was 2,569, an increase of 66.7% compared to the same period last year; the agreed foreign capital was $5.45 billion, an increase of 42%; the actual utilized foreign capital was $3.76 billion, an increase of 32.7%.

	— Urban and rural residents' savings have significantly rebounded, and the scale of credit has been somewhat controlled. In the first half of the year, residents' savings deposits increased significantly, an increase of 64.4 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, with the majority being time deposits, which is beneficial for increasing production and construction funds and reducing pressure on the consumer market. Due to the increase in savings and the control of cash expenditures, the situation of currency withdrawal is better than the same period last year.

Yuan Mu also introduced that although the total social demand has been controlled in the first half of the year, the total social supply has not shown the "stagflation" phenomenon that people are concerned about, and effective supply continues to grow. However, the difficulties and contradictions facing the national economy are still relatively numerous, mainly:

	— Although the inflationary trend has been curbed, more efforts are needed to achieve the goal of a significant reduction in the price increase rate compared to last year. It is estimated that the national retail price level in the first half of the year will increase by 25.5% compared to the same period last year, mainly due to the carry-over effect of last year's prices, with new price increase factors only affecting the overall price level by 7 percentage points.

	— The economic structure is still irrational, enterprise economic benefits are not ideal, national fiscal revenue growth is slow, and expenditures remain high, resulting in reduced surpluses. Compared to the same period last year, in the first five months, the cost of comparable products in budgetary state-owned industrial enterprises exceeded by 18%, and the loss of loss-making enterprises increased by 1.1 times.

The State Council requires that in the second half of the year, all regions and departments must continue to decisively reduce the scale of fixed asset investment, strictly control the rapid growth of consumption funds, adjust the economic structure, and improve the weak links in agriculture, energy, raw materials, transportation, and other areas. It is necessary to increase effective supply and further ease the supply-demand contradiction. It is necessary to carry out in-depth production and savings, income and expenditure reduction movements, save energy, reduce consumption, improve quality, accelerate the turnover of funds, and oppose all wasteful practices. It is necessary to improve economic benefits in all aspects and strive to achieve sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

    袁木召开新闻发布会介绍情况
    上半年经济发展平稳
    控制物价上涨调整经济结构还需努力
    本报北京7月11日讯　国务院发言人袁木今天上午召开新闻发布会，向中外记者介绍了我国上半年经济发展情况。他说，今年上半年虽然受到部分地区社会动乱和北京反革命暴乱的严重干扰，但由于各级干部、广大职工和农民坚守岗位，努力生产，认真贯彻治理整顿和深化改革的方针，中国经济仍保持了平稳发展的势头，主要表现在：
    ——夏收作物获得丰收。据初步统计，全国夏粮总产量将突破9300万吨，比去年增产200多万吨，是历史上又一个丰收年景。夏收油菜籽550多万吨，比去年增产50多万吨。
    ——工业生产保持了比较适当的发展速度。上半年，全国工业总产值完成6396亿元，比去年同期增长10.8％，增长幅度回落6.4个百分点。3月份以后，能源生产回升快，上半年一次能源总量达47632万吨，比去年同期增长5.9％。主要原材料生产也扭转了年初下降较多的局面，产量逐步上升。基本日用消费品生产逐月加快，增加了市场可供货源。
    ——固定资产投资规模开始压缩，新开工项目明显减少。前5个月，全民所有制单位完成固定资产投资442亿元，与去年同期相比，投资规模压缩7.1％；新开工5万元以上投资项目减少73.6％。
    ——市场零售物价猛涨势头有所抑制，商品销售比较平稳。肉、禽、蛋、蔬菜等主要副食品价格比较平稳，扭转了去年猛涨的势头。上半年预计，社会商品零售总额达4100多亿元，比去年同期增长20％左右，低于去年同期增长24.6％的幅度。
    ——对外经济继续发展，利用外资规模进一步扩大。前6个月，海关进出口货物总值达503亿美元，比去年同期增长16.9％。全国新批准利用外资项目前5个月为2569个，比去年同期增长66.7％；协议外资额54.5亿美元，增长42％；实际利用外资37.6亿美元，增长32.7％。
    ——城乡居民储蓄明显回升，信贷规模有所控制。上半年，居民储蓄存款增加较多，比年初增加644亿元，其中大部分为定期储蓄，有利于增加生产建设资金和减轻对消费市场的压力。由于储蓄增加和现金支出有所控制，使货币回笼情况好于去年同期。
    袁木还介绍，虽然上半年社会总需求有所控制，社会总供给没有出现人们担忧的“滞涨”现象，有效供给持续增长，但是，目前我国经济面临的困难和矛盾还比较多，主要有：
    ——通货膨胀势头虽有抑制，但要实现物价上涨幅度明显低于去年的目标还要作更大的努力。预计上半年全国零售物价总水平比去年同期上涨25.5％，主要是去年物价翘尾巴因素影响，新涨价因素只影响物价总水平上升7个百分点。
    ——经济结构还不合理，企业经济效益不理想，国家财政收入增长较慢，支出居高不下，结余减少。和去年同期相比，前5个月，预算内国营工业企业可比产品成本超支18％，亏损企业亏损额增亏1.1倍。
    国务院要求各地区、各部门下半年要继续坚决压缩固定资产投资规模，严格控制消费基金的过快增长，搞好经济结构的调整，把农业、能源、原材料、交通等薄弱环节搞上去，切实增加有效供给，进一步缓解供需矛盾。要深入开展增产节约、增收节支的运动，节约能源，降低消耗，提高质量，加速资金周转，反对一切铺张浪费现象，切实提高各个方面的经济效益，努力实现国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展。
