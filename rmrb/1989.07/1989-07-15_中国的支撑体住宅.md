What is a supportive structure residence? Professor Bào Jiāshēng in his recently published book “Supportive Structure Residences” points out that the framework of a residence is the supportive structure, and the components used to divide the internal space within the residential framework are called “divisible parts” or “filling materials.” In the construction process, dividing these two parts into three stages for implementation is what constitutes a supportive structure residence. Based on this fundamental concept, Nanjing Institute of Technology’s Department of Architecture and Wuxi Housing Bureau constructed 11 experimental supportive structure buildings between 1983 and 1985. Of these, 9 are courtyard stepped-type residential buildings, and 2 are three-story villa-style small buildings. The floor plans of these residences are all composed of the same unit supportive structure. The courtyard’s floor plan dimensions are 10.8 meters square. The number of floors in the residences is generally 2 to 5 layers and 2 to 6 layers, providing the vast majority of households with more than 15 square meters of private outdoor living space. The ground-floor households all have courtyards, and some even have front and back small courtyards. Moreover, every 4 to 5 buildings form a group, surrounding a public outdoor space, which serves as a green area and a “living room” for social interaction.

    中国的支撑体住宅
    什么是支撑体住宅？鲍家声教授在最近出版的《支撑体住宅》一书中指出，住宅的骨架为支撑体，住宅骨架空间内用以分隔内部空间的物质构件，叫作“可分体”或“填充体。”在建造过程中，将这两部分分为三个阶段实施建设的住宅即为支撑体住宅。根据这个基本思路，南京工学院建筑系和无锡房管局于1983～1985年建成11幢支撑体实验性房屋，其中9幢为四合院台阶型住宅楼，两幢为3层别墅式小楼。这些住宅的平面类型都是由同细胞一单元支撑体组合构成的。四合院的平面尺寸为10.8米见方。住宅的层数一般为2～5层和2～6层，为绝大多数住户提供了15平方米以上的私家户外生活空间，底层住户均有院落，有的还有前后小院。而且每4～5幢楼呈一组，围一个公共室外空间，以作绿地、社交的“客厅。”
