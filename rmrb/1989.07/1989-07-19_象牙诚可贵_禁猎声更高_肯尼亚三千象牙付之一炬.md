Xinhua News Agency, Nairobi, July 18th.

Ivory is precious, but the call to ban hunting is louder. Kenya burns 3,000 tons of ivory.

In the afternoon at around 2 PM, approximately 8 kilometers from the center of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, the Kenya National Wildlife Conservation Area was bustling with people. Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, accompanied by military and civilian officials, lit a torch to ignite 12 tons of ivory worth over $3 million.

Before the fire was lit, President Moi stood in front of a pile of ivory resembling a small mountain and delivered a speech, appealing to the world to stop all forms of ivory trading and join Kenya in saving the endangered African elephants.

He said, "Today, we gather to destroy ivory worth a fortune. First, it shows Kenya's determination to protect wildlife. Second, it is to awaken the world to take immediate action to eliminate the increasingly rampant poaching of elephants."

Thousands of Kenyans and over a hundred foreign journalists came to witness the burning of the ivory. In front of the blazing fire, President Moi several times walked over to the journalists to chat with them, thanking them for their presence and hoping they would spread Kenya's call to ban all forms of ivory trading around the world.

The pile of ivory being burned consisted of about 3,000 tusks. Most of them were seized by Kenyan police and security personnel from poachers in the past five years. In early June, the Kenyan government issued a call to ban all forms of ivory trading. On June 22, President Moi ordered the destruction of this stockpiled ivory. He pointed out that relying solely on legal provisions to protect elephants is far from enough. We must eliminate the ivory trading market. We must show the world our determination to ban ivory trading through concrete actions.

As early as 1977, the Kenyan Parliament legislated to ban all forms of elephant hunting within the country. However, due to the existence of legal ivory trading markets around the world and the rising price of ivory (currently over $200 per kilogram), poachers risked breaking the law to hunt elephants, and poaching activities became increasingly rampant. According to Kenyan government statistics, in the past 10 years, the number of elephants in Kenya has sharply decreased from 65,000 to 17,000.

Figures released by the World Wildlife Fund show that in the past 10 years, poaching activities have reduced the number of elephants in Tanzania, Zambia, and Zaire from 203,000, 160,000, and 376,000 to 75,000, 45,000, and 103,000 respectively. The total number of elephants on the African continent has drastically decreased from 1.5 million to 625,000.

Kenya's proposal to ban all forms of ivory trading has been supported by most African countries. The United States, Canada, Switzerland, and European Community countries, as well as Japan and Hong Kong, have agreed to partially ban ivory trading. Currently, Kenya's proposal has been submitted to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. It is expected that the organization will formally announce a complete ban on ivory trading in October this year.

### 象牙诚可贵  禁猎声更高  肯尼亚三千象牙付之一炬

    象牙诚可贵  禁猎声更高
    肯尼亚三千象牙付之一炬
    新华社记者　黄谨
    今日下午2时许，距肯尼亚首都内罗毕市中心8公里的肯尼亚国家自然保护区内人声鼎沸。肯尼亚总统丹尼尔·阿拉普·莫伊在文武官员陪同下，用一支火炬点燃了价值300多万美元的12吨象牙。
    点火前，莫伊总统站在一座似小山的象牙堆前发表讲话，向全世界呼吁停止一切形式的象牙交易，同肯尼亚一道，为拯救濒临灭绝的非洲大象而共同努力。
    他说：“我们今天聚会毁掉价值连城的象牙，一是表示肯尼亚保护野生动物的决心，二是唤起世人立即行动起来，消灭日益疯狂地捕杀大象活动。”
    前来观看焚烧象牙的有数千名肯尼亚人和上百名外国记者。在熊熊燃烧的火堆前，莫伊总统几次走近记者群同他们交谈，感谢他们的光临，并希望他们把肯尼亚要求禁止一切形式象牙交易的呼声传遍世界。
    这堆被焚毁的象牙约3000余根。它们大多是近5年中被肯尼亚警察和保安人员从偷猎者手中缴获的。6月初，肯尼亚政府发出呼吁，禁止一切形式的象牙交易。6月22日，莫伊总统下令烧毁这批库存象牙。他指出，光靠法律条文保护大象，还远远不够，必须消灭象牙交易市场。我们就要以实际行动向世人表明禁止象牙交易的决心。
    早在1977年，肯尼亚议会就立法禁止国内一切形式的猎象活动，但由于世界上存在着合法的象牙交易市场，加之象牙价格与日俱增（目前已高达每公斤200多美元），偷猎者不惜以身试法，捕猎活动日益猖獗。据肯尼亚政府统计，在过去10年中，肯尼亚的大象头数已从6.5万头锐减至1.7万头。
    世界野生动物基金会公布的数字表明，在近10年中，偷猎活动使坦桑尼亚、赞比亚和扎伊尔的大象头数分别从20.3万头、16万头和37.6万头减到7.5万头、4.5万头和10.3万头。整个非洲大陆的大象头数已从150万头急剧下降到62.5万头。
    肯尼亚提出的禁止一切形式的象牙买卖建议已得到了大多数非洲国家的支持。美国、加拿大、瑞士和欧洲共同体国家以及日本和香港亦同意部分禁止象牙交易。目前，肯尼亚的建议已提交濒危野生动植物国际贸易公约组织。预计该组织将于今年10月正式宣布全面禁止象牙交易。
