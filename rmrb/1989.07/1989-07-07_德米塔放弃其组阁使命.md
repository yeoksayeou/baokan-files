Demita, who was tasked with reorganizing the Italian government, met with President Cossiga on the 6th and announced his abandonment of the mission to form a cabinet. After meeting with President Cossiga, Demita made a statement to the press, saying that although he had made every effort, he had not been able to create the political conditions necessary for the reconstruction of a united government. The main obstacle was the Socialist Party's objection to the Republican Party and the Liberal Party's joint candidacy with the Radical Party in the European Parliament elections.

    德米塔放弃其组阁使命
    受命重组意大利政府的德米塔6日会见科西加总统，表示放弃其组阁使命。德米塔会见科西加总统后对记者发表声明说，虽然他作出了一切努力，但并未能造成重建联合政府的政治条件，其主要障碍是社会党对共和党和自由党在欧洲议会选举中与激进党联合竞选提出异议。
