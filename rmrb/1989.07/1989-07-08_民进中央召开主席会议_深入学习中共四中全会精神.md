The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held its 12th Chairman's Meeting today, calling on all members of the League to deeply study the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to align their thoughts with the speech of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, and to strive for the tasks set by the 13th National Congress and the Fourth Plenary Session.

The meeting noted with satisfaction that after the Party Central Committee's wise decision to quell the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, Beijing and other parts of the country have restored normal order. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the masses are working hard to make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and riots. The meeting hopes that the Party Central Committee will promptly formulate specific policies to strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two types of different contradictions, to expand the scope of education and unity, and to ensure the complete victory of this struggle.

The meeting emphasized that decades of practice have proven that the socialist path is the only choice for the Chinese people, and that without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, it is impossible to achieve victory and development in the socialist cause. The meeting urged all local organizations of the China Democratic League to prioritize the implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and to strengthen ideological education among members. They should link this with actual thoughts and work, and seriously implement the education on adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization in all League activities, to contribute more to the four major tasks proposed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting was presided over by Lei Jieqiong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League. Vice-Chairpersons Chen Shungli, Ge Zhicheng, Chu Zhuang, Ye Zhishan, Mei Xiangming, Chen Nanshan, Feng Jicai, and Deng Weizhi attended the meeting.
