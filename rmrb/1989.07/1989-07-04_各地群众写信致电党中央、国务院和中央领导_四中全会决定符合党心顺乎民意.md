Since the publication of the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, people from various places have been writing letters and calling the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the central leaders to express their firm support for the decisions made at the Fourth Plenary Session.

A telegram from Wuhan Boiler Factory and other units to Comrade Jiang Zemin stated that the decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session are in line with the hearts of the Party members and the will of the people. We firmly support these decisions and will respond to the Party's call with practical actions by redoubling our efforts to improve production, make more contributions, and recover the significant losses caused by the turmoil and riots. Chengdu University of Electronic Science and Technology and other institutions of higher learning sent letters and telegrams expressing their commitment to follow the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, take effective measures to strengthen ideological and political work, resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization, and strive to make their schools bastions of building socialist spiritual and material civilization. They also pledged to cultivate professionals who love the country, the people, and socialism. The CPC Committee of Xiangtan, Hunan Province, sent a telegram stating that the 4,000 Party members and tens of thousands of people in Shaoshan declare to the Party: We will definitely study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech seriously and work hard to accomplish the four tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session. The entire contingent of the 56189 unit of the People's Liberation Army of China sent a telegram stating that we will maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee, guard the borders, defend the passes, and protect the southwestern gateway. Some cadres and technical workers from Anhui Province's Ma'anshan Steel Company, Beijing's First Construction Company, and Shandong Construction Hospital sent letters expressing that the Fourth Plenary Session has formed a new central leadership core that adheres to the four cardinal principles and the reform and opening-up policy, and has rich experience in governing the Party and the country. With such a "backbone," we are reassured. Some university students who participated in the protests also sent letters and telegrams expressing their determination to learn from the experience, cherish their precious time in school, and make good use of it.

In the letters and telegrams from the people, there are also sincere hopes and active suggestions on how to implement the four tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session. The main points are: in the process of reform and opening up, we must effectively solve the problem of being "strong on one hand and weak on the other"; we must strengthen people's democratic dictatorship, strengthen anti-corruption efforts, and resolutely eradicate corruption; we must maintain close ties with the people, listen to their opinions widely, and do a few things that the people are satisfied with.

The central leaders of the Party and the State Council attach great importance to these opinions and suggestions. They welcome everyone to contribute their ideas for completing the tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session and welcome people from all walks of life to exercise supervision in accordance with the principles of democracy and the rule of law.
