	Soviet Union's Overseas Loans Exceed 87.5 Billion Rubles

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th - During today's ongoing session of the Supreme Soviet, Kamenev, the candidate for Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers responsible for foreign economic work, revealed that the loans provided by the Soviet Union to foreign countries have so far reached 87.5 billion rubles (approximately 13.5 billion US dollars), of which over 20 billion rubles are freely convertible foreign exchange.

	Kamenev acknowledged that the Soviet Union's foreign trade accounts for only 4% of the world's total foreign trade, while raw materials make up 60% of Soviet exports. In response to representatives' criticisms about the large-scale export of raw materials without considering the country's future interests, he promised that in the coming years, reforms will be made to the foreign trade structure to increase the proportion of finished products in exports to 60%.

    苏对外贷款逾八百亿卢布
    新华社莫斯科6月30日电　在今天继续举行的最高苏维埃会议上，被提名为负责外经工作的苏联部长会议副主席候选人卡缅采夫透露，苏联借给外国的债款迄今已达875亿卢布（约合1350亿美元），其中200多亿卢布是可以自由兑换的外汇。
    卡缅采夫承认，苏联的外贸仅占世界外贸总额的4％，而原料却占苏出口的60％。他针对代表们对不顾国家将来利益大量出口原料的批评，答应今后几年要改革外贸结构，使成品在出口的比重增加到60％。
