The Chinese Embassy's education section in France was attacked again. We have lodged a strong protest with the French government.

New China News Agency, Beijing, July 17th: Today, a responsible official from the Western Europe Division of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the French Ambassador to China to discuss the recent attack on the Chinese Embassy's education section in France.

The official stated that on the evening of July 14th, a group of unidentified young people attacked the Chinese Embassy's education section in France, smashing the glass windows of the second-floor office and stealing the copper plaque from the building.

The official pointed out that the Chinese Embassy's education section in France had previously been forcibly occupied and harassed by a group of people on June 29th. Just 15 days later, the section was subjected to another savage attack. This is another serious incident directed against China, a blatant violation of the diplomatic premises of a sovereign state, and a flagrant disregard for international norms and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It seriously threatens the safety of the Chinese Embassy's premises and personnel in France. On these grounds, he was instructed to lodge a strong protest with the French government, demanding a thorough investigation and punishment of the perpetrators, compensation for the damages incurred by the education section, and guarantees that such incidents will not occur again in the future.

    中国驻法使馆教育处又遭袭击
    我向法国政府提出强烈抗议
    新华社北京7月17日电　中国外交部西欧司负责人今天约见法国驻华大使，就中国驻法国大使馆教育处再次遭袭击事进行交涉。
    西欧司负责人说，7月14日晚，一伙身份不明的青年袭击中国驻法国大使馆教育处，砸碎该处二层办公室玻璃，撬走该处铜牌。
    这位负责人指出，中国驻法国大使馆教育处曾于6月29日被一伙人强行侵占和骚扰。仅仅过了15天，该处又遭到了野蛮袭击，这是又一起矛头针对中国的严重事件，是对一个主权国家的外交代表机构的粗暴侵犯，是对国际关系准则和维也纳外交关系公约的肆意践踏，严重威胁了中国驻法国大使馆馆舍和人员的安全。对此，他奉命向法国政府提出强烈抗议，并坚决要求法国政府侦查并惩处肇事者，赔偿教育处遭受的损失，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
