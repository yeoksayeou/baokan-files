Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 23rd. People's Daily reporter Chen Guoqing, Xinhua News Agency reporter Zhao Yongjin report: "Unify ideological understanding, correctly implement policies, strengthen market management, and do a good job in mobilization work to fully procure all cotton sold by farmers." Minister of Commerce Hu Ping made this requirement at the nationwide cotton procurement work meeting that concluded today.

The nationwide cotton procurement work meeting was held from July 21st to 23rd in Shijiazhuang. The meeting believed that doing a good job in this year's cotton procurement work is both an economic issue and a political issue, with special and important significance. Cotton is a strategic commodity in China's national economy, playing a crucial role in ensuring the production of the textile industry and the supply of cotton textiles in the market, as well as in earning foreign exchange through exports. Fully procuring the cotton that should be procured is vital for stabilizing the economy, maintaining overall stability, and ensuring social stability.

According to reports from representatives at the meeting, this year's cotton growth nationwide is relatively good. If there are no major disasters, the output may exceed last year's. This is the foundation for doing a good job in procurement work. The meeting emphasized that leaders in cotton-producing areas should, like they manage cotton production, focus on cotton procurement. Governments in major cotton-producing areas should have a leader responsible for this work, implementing a leadership responsibility system, with each level taking responsibility and ensuring thorough implementation. Efforts should be made to strengthen ideological and policy education for cotton farmers, ensuring that they do not forget the country in times of abundance, do not argue over grades, and do not argue over prices, fully selling the cotton they should to the state.

The meeting required that all levels of supply and marketing cooperatives concentrate their efforts on doing a good job in cotton procurement. They should adhere to the principles of designated areas, fixed points, and scheduled procurement with certificates (contracts), ensuring that whoever signs the contract procures the cotton. They should strictly implement national policies related to cotton standards, strictly follow cotton inspection procedures, and not engage in grade suppression or grade inflation. Local preferential policies should not be reflected in procurement prices. Banking departments should ensure the allocation of special funds for cotton procurement, and local areas should not misappropriate or divert these funds, avoiding issuing IOUs to farmers. At the same time, they should ensure the timely redemption of reward materials.

The meeting emphasized that cotton should be procured and managed uniformly by supply and marketing cooperatives, without opening the cotton market or implementing a dual-track pricing system. To prevent a "cotton war," the State Council decided to dispatch cotton procurement inspection teams during the cotton procurement season to various major cotton-producing areas for inspections and guidance, and to coordinate and resolve related issues on the spot. Each province should also follow this approach, organizing coordination between regions and counties for procurement.

    全国棉花收购工作会议提出要求
    把农民交售的棉花全收上来
    由供销社统一收购经营不搞价格双轨制
    本报石家庄7月23日电　本报记者陈国琦、新华社记者赵永金报道：“统一思想认识，正确执行政策，加强市场管理，做好动员工作，将农民交售的棉花全部收购上来。”商业部部长胡平在今天结束的全国棉花收购工作会议上，提出了今年棉花收购工作的总要求。
    全国棉花收购工作会议于7月21日至23日在石家庄召开。会议认为，做好今年棉花收购工作，既是一个经济问题，又是一个政治问题，具有特殊重要的意义。棉花在我国国民经济中是具有战略意义的商品，对保证纺织工业生产和市场棉纺织品供应，以及出口换汇，都具有十分重要的作用。把应该收购的棉花全部收上来，对于稳定经济，稳定大局，维护社会安定，至关重要。
    据各地与会代表反映，今年全国棉花长势较好，如不发生大灾，产量可能超过去年。这是做好收购工作的基础。会议强调，各产棉区的领导，要像抓棉花生产那样，下力量抓棉花收购。棉花主产区的政府要有一名领导同志负责这项工作，实行领导干部责任制，层层负责，一抓到底。要对广大棉农加强形势教育和政策教育，做到丰收不忘国家，不争级，不争价，把应出售的棉花全部交售国家。
    会议要求，各级供销社要集中力量，切实抓好棉花收购工作。要坚持划片定点，约时凭证（合同）收购，坚持谁签订合同由谁收购。要严格执行国家有关棉花标准政策，严格按棉花检验规程办事，不得压级压价或抬级抬价。各地自行规定的地方性优惠政策，一律不要体现在收购价格上。银行部门要落实安排好收购棉花的专项资金，各地不得挤占挪用，避免向农民打“白条”。同时还要保证奖发物资的及时兑现。
    会议强调指出，棉花由供销社统一收购、经营，不开放棉花市场，不搞价格双轨制。为防止出现“棉花大战”，国务院决定在棉花收购季节，派出棉花收购巡视团，到各棉花主产地区巡回检查指导，就地协调处理有关问题。各省也要仿照此做法，组织好地区之间、县之间的收购协调。
