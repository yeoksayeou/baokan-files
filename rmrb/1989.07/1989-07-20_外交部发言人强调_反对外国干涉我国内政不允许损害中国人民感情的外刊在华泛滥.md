Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Emphasizes Opposition to Foreign Interference in China's Internal Affairs and Prohibits the Spread of Foreign Publications that Harm Chinese People's Feelings

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 20th - Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Li Jinhua stated at today's afternoon press conference that China opposes interference by foreign governments, organizations, or individuals in China's internal affairs and the harming of the Chinese people's national sentiments.

In response to a reporter's question, she said that China has already lodged strong protests against some countries' blatant interference in China's internal affairs. She also reiterated that China's policy of reform and opening up remains unchanged. China is willing to develop relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and to develop economic and trade exchanges with all countries on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.

In response to a question from a reporter from the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, she said that China does not reject all foreign publications but does not allow foreign publications that contain content interfering in China's internal affairs and harming the Chinese people's national sentiments to spread in China. This is only natural.

    外交部发言人强调
    反对外国干涉我国内政不允许损害中国人民感情的外刊在华泛滥
    新华社北京7月20日电  外交部发言人李金华在今天下午的新闻发布会上说，中国反对外国政府、组织或个人干涉中国的内政，伤害中国人民的民族感情。
    她在回答记者提问时说，对于有些国家粗暴干涉中国内政，中国方面已经提出了强烈抗议。她同时重申，中国的改革开放政策不变。中国愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上同各国发展关系，并在平等互利的基础上同各国发展经济贸易往来。
    她在回答香港《南华早报》记者的问题时说，中国并不拒绝一切外来报刊，而是不允许载有干涉中国内政和损害中国人民民族感情内容的外国报刊在中国泛滥。这是理所当然的。
