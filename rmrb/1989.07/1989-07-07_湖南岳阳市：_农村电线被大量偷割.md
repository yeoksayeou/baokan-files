	Yueyang City, Hunan:
	Rural Power Lines Being Massively Stolen

	Since last winter and this spring, 35 cases of high and low voltage aluminum wire theft have occurred in Lu Kou, Yun Xi, and Lu Cheng townships in our district. A total of 19,620 meters of aluminum wire has been stolen, causing direct economic losses of 25,470 yuan. Sixteen villages and 37 village committees have been without power, seriously affecting spring farming production.

	The reasons for the large-scale theft of rural high and low voltage power lines are:

	Some waste collection departments and small aluminum product processing factories buy aluminum wire at high prices. They do not ask about the source of the aluminum wire and do not require relevant certificates, providing convenience for criminals to sell stolen goods.

	The public lacks awareness of prevention. High and low voltage aluminum wires are all set up outdoors. Criminals often commit crimes at night. Sometimes when the lighting wires are cut, the public thinks it is the power supply department that has stopped the power, and does not report to the relevant departments in a timely manner. Especially the water pump lines in Ji Pu are unmanned during the winter, giving criminals an opportunity to act.

	It is difficult to solve the cases. Due to delayed reporting or because criminals commit crimes while on the move, it increases the difficulty of solving the cases. Of the aforementioned 35 cases of aluminum wire theft, only 9 have been solved so far.

	Relevant departments should take measures to rectify the waste materials market and plug loopholes; at the same time, organize village and team joint defense, strengthen the management of high and low voltage power lines and water pump lines; and punish criminals according to law.

### 湖南岳阳市：  农村电线被大量偷割

    湖南岳阳市：
    农村电线被大量偷割
    去冬今春以来，我区路口、云溪、陆城3个乡镇就发生盗割高低压铝线案件35起，盗割铝线19620米，直接经济损失25470元。有16个村37个村民小组断电，春耕生产受到严重影响。
    农用高低压线被大量盗割的原因是：
    一些废旧收购部门和小铝制品加工厂高价收购铝线。他们既不问铝线来源，又不需有关证明，为不法分子销赃提供方便。
    群众防范意识不强。高低压铝线都架设在野外，不法分子大多在晚上作案，有时照明电线被割，群众还以为是供电部门停电，没有及时向有关部门报告。特别是机埠抽水线路，冬闲无人看管。这给不法分子以可乘之机。
    三、破案难。因报案不及时，或因不法分子流窜作案，给破案增加难度。上述35起盗割铝线案，至今仅破获9起。
    有关部门应采取措施，整顿废旧物资市场，堵塞漏洞；同时，组织村队联防，加强对高低压电线和机埠的管理；依法惩处犯罪分子。
