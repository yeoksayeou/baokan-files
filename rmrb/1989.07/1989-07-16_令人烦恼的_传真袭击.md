    The Annoying "Fax Attack"
    When many Americans walk into their offices every morning, they often find long sheets of paper trailing from their fax machines, most of which are various fax advertisements—travel, haircuts, cosmetics, and gardening tools, etc. This type of "fax attack" that requires time to process and wastes paper has caused many people to be quite troubled.

    In recent years, with the rapid popularization and promotion of fax machines, the fax advertising business has emerged in the United States. Advertisers, in order to make money, do not hesitate to harm others for personal gain, exploiting this new technology to conduct advertising and promote various products. It is said that fax advertising has several advantages: first, fax advertising is just emerging, which has a certain appeal to consumers; second, it is convenient and fast to send, creating a sense of urgency psychologically; third, it is cost-effective. If sent during the cheapest time of the night, one page of advertising only costs fifteen cents, while mailing a printed advertisement costs at least twenty-five cents in postage.

    For many people, fax advertising is equivalent to forcing the recipient to pay for the advertisement. What is even more annoying is that a new roll of paper will be quickly used up by fax advertisements. Therefore, fax machine owners are complaining, and the issue has even reached state legislatures. It is reported that fifteen states in the United States have proposed bills to restrict or prohibit fax advertising without customer consent. The Florida State Legislature proposed a fine of up to $10,000 for violators.

    令人烦恼的“传真袭击”
    当许多美国人每天早上走进自己的办公室时，往往发现他们的传真机上拖着长长的纸张，上面大多是五花八门的传真广告——旅游、理发、化妆品和园艺工具等等。这种既需时间处理，又费纸张的“传真袭击”使不少人大伤脑筋。
    近年来，随着传真机的迅速普及和推广，传真广告业务在美国应运而生。广告商为了赚钱，不惜损人利己，肆意利用这一新技术手段进行广告宣传、推销各种产品。据说，传真广告具有多种优势：一是传真广告还刚刚兴起，对消费者有某种吸引力；二是传送方便、速度快，在心理上给人一种“紧迫感”；三是费用低，如果在晚间电话收费最便宜的时候传送，一页广告只花十五美分，而邮寄一份印刷广告至少要付二十五美分邮费。
    对许多人来说，传真广告等于强迫接收者交付广告费，更令人烦恼的是新换的一卷纸过不了多久就会被传真广告“吃个精光”。因此，传真机拥有者们怨声载道，甚至已闹到各州议会。据悉，美国已有十五个州议会提出议案，要求限制或禁止未经客户许可的传真广告。佛罗里达州议会提出对违者要重罚一万美元。　·张亮·
