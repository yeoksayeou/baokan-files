After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, the capital Beijing reported a bumper harvest of summer grain: the total wheat production exceeded 900 million kilograms, an increase of nearly 10% compared to last year.

The suburbs of Beijing planted over 2.8 million mu of wheat. To increase the yield per unit area, the municipal agricultural department cultivated and promoted high-quality wheat varieties such as Jinghua and Jingshuang. This spring, the area planted with corn in wheat fields was significantly reduced; during the wheat growth period, agricultural experts were invited multiple times to visit the fields, providing timely assistance in controlling aphids that harm wheat, helping farmers master the reasonable ratio of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application, and achieving chemical herbicide application over 1.9 million mu. Due to these measures, the phenomenon of wheat lodging and death significantly decreased this spring, with an increase of one-tenth in the number of ears per mu compared to last year, and the weight of a thousand grains of wheat also increased by more than one gram.

Entering the wheat harvesting stage, the plain areas basically achieved mechanized harvesting as the main method, and the entire harvesting period was shortened by 5 days compared to last year. It is reported that by June 30, the city's wheat storage had reached 1.8 times the planned procurement target, and Shunyi County completed the annual grain procurement task in one season.

    小麦总产比去年增加近一成
    北京超额完成夏粮计划定购任务
    本报北京7月4日讯　平息反革命暴乱后的首都北京传来夏粮丰收的喜讯：小麦总产量逾9亿公斤，比去年增产近一成。
    北京郊区种植小麦280多万亩。为了提高单产，市农业部门培育并推广京华、京双等优良麦种；今春大大减少了在麦田套种玉米的种植面积；小麦生长期间，多次邀请农业专家深入田间，及时帮助解决除治危害小麦的蚜虫，帮助农民掌握使用氮、磷肥调配的合理比例，并实现化学剂除草190多万亩。由于采取了上述措施，今春小麦倒伏、死亡现象大大减少，每亩苗穗比去年增加一成，千粒麦粒也比去年增重一克多。
    进入麦收阶段，平原地区基本上实现了以机械化为主体的联合收割，整个麦收期也比去年缩短了5天。据悉，到6月30日，全市小麦入库已达到计划定购指标的1.8倍，顺义县则实现一季完成全年粮食定购任务。
