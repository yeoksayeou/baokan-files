The People's Daily, Beijing, July 28th - A reporter from the National People's Congress Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee Youth Special Committee learned that the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Protection of Minors" is being actively revised and is striving to be submitted to the National People's Congress for discussion and approval as soon as possible.

Since the first discussion of the draft "Law on the Protection of Minors" was organized in March this year, the National Youth Legislation Office has received nearly 500 opinions from various quarters. Units, consultants, experts, and scholars participating in the youth legislation working conference have all put forward many beneficial insights and actively participated in the revision work. In late June, this office, in combination with the actual situation of China's youth education and protection, effectively absorbed the feedback opinions and made a serious study and revision of this draft.

Today, the National People's Congress Internal and Judicial Affairs Committee Youth Special Committee held its second meeting. The attendees proposed further revision opinions on the revised draft of the "Law on the Protection of Minors." The head of the Youth Special Committee and the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, Liu Yandong, gave a speech titled "Summarizing the Past, Thinking About the Future, and Striving to Cultivate a New Generation of Socialists." The attendees, in conjunction with the study of Deng Xiaoping's recent important talks and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, put forward active suggestions on the youth education issues that have aroused the concern of the whole society. They believe that ideological and political education should be targeted, and the pace of legislation should be accelerated.
