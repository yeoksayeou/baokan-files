The People's Liberation Army has vigorously promoted agricultural science and technology activities. Significant achievements have been made in scientific experiments, technological promotion, scientific management, and talent training. These efforts have driven military agricultural and sideline production to a higher level and achieved good economic benefits.

Since 1987, the entire military has established 13 scientific experiment stations and conducted over 20 scientific experiments and demonstration activities. The marine aquaculture of scallops, sea cucumbers, and abalones at the marine aquaculture farm of a certain garrison regiment in Changshan, Jinan Military Region, has been successful. After the experience was promoted, the number of military marine delicacy aquaculture farms increased to 9, and last year, 1.5 million kilograms of marine products were produced. The Beijing Garrison Command's experiment with net-box fish farming achieved remarkable results. In 4 units, the yield per mu increased from 15,000 kilograms to 55,000 kilograms, paving a new path for the annual development of freshwater aquaculture. The factory-style cultivation of rice seedlings and mechanized rice transplanting were successfully experimented with in the Yimajiahe Farm of the Jilin Military Region and the Baihezhai Farm of the Tianjin Garrison Command, reducing the average cost by 30%.

In recent years, due to strengthened management of agricultural science and technology, the military has won 10 scientific research and promotion awards, and six types of liquor have won military, provincial, and ministerial-level quality product awards.

    广泛开展农业科技活动
    全军农副生产效益良好
    本报北京7月24日讯　人民解放军各部队大力开展农业科技活动，在科学试验、技术推广、科技管理、人才培训等方面取得显著成绩，推动军队农副业生产向高层次发展，并取得较好的经济效益。
    从1987年开始，全军先后成立13个科学试验站，开展了20多项科学试验、示范活动。济南军区内长山某守备师海上养殖场人工养殖扇贝、海参、鲍鱼获得成功。其经验推广后，军队海珍品养殖场发展到9个，去年生产海产品达150多万公斤。北京卫戍区试验网箱养鱼收到显著效果，在4个单位试验、示范，亩产从1.5万公斤提高到5.5万公斤，为全年发展淡水养殖走出了一条新路。水稻工厂化育秧和机械化插秧在吉林省军区饮马河农场、天津警备区柏各庄农场试验成功，使成本平均下降30％。
    近几年，由于加强了对农业科技的管理，全军已有10项科研和推广成果获军队科技奖，六种酒类获军队、省、部级优质产品奖。
