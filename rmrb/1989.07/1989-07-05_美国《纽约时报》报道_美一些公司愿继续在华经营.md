The New York Times reported today that most American companies currently operating in China are optimistic about the country's long-term economic prospects and plan to maintain their business presence there.

Industry representatives in the United States said that due to recent statements from Chinese leaders offering more incentives to foreign investors, some American companies are eager to enter the Chinese market.

An economist from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Mr. Chen, stated that American and other foreign businesspeople view Jiang Zemin's recent appointment as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party as a promising sign. During his time in Shanghai, Jiang Zemin was committed to economic reforms, which are well-known to foreign investors.

Many American company executives who have invested and done business in China said that despite recent turmoil, the country's favorable economic conditions have not fundamentally changed. These conditions include a market of 1 billion consumers, a pressing need for foreign exchange, and low wages that offer significant potential for the development of manufacturing.

Mr. Iger of Rockwell International said that concerns about the current working environment in China are unwarranted. Until recently, his business interactions in China have remained unchanged, with no alterations in the attitudes or working methods of Chinese officials.

Ben Marsh, a spokesperson for the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company, said that in the long term, "the prospects for operating in China are very optimistic. We have no reason to change our views."

Liz Dolan, a spokesperson for Nike, which has been operating in China for 10 years, said that the unrest in Beijing has not affected the company's business activities or plans in China. Dolan emphasized, "Undoubtedly, China is a part of our long-term plans. We believe that China not only has enormous potential as a manufacturing center but also as a vast consumer market. We have no intention of leaving arbitrarily."

The New York Times also reported that some American companies are hesitant to expand their business in China before the political situation clarifies, but they still consider China an attractive place to develop new businesses. These American companies are also concerned that if they reduce their business in China, scale back their development plans, or decide not to enter the market, they will give an advantage to other foreign competitors.

    美国《纽约时报》报道
    美一些公司愿继续在华经营
    本报纽约7月3日电　记者刘开宸报道：据《纽约时报》今天消息，正在中国经营的大多数美国公司对中国长期的经济发展前景表示信任，打算保持在那里的业务。
    美国工业界人士说，由于中国领导人新近表示愿意对外国投资者给予更多优惠，一些美国公司想借此打入中国市场。
    位于旧金山的美国联邦储备银行的一位经济学家陈先生说，美国和其它国家的实业家认为，江泽民在上周末担任中国共产党总书记是一个有希望的迹象，因为他在上海工作期间致力于经济改革，外商较为了解。
    在中国投资和经商的许多美国公司的总经理说，中国最近虽发生动乱，但其有利的经济条件并未发生根本变化，如10亿消费者，急需外汇，工资低廉使制造业有很大的发展潜力等。
    罗克韦尔公司的伊格先生说，有人对中国现在的具体工作环境担心也无必要。直到最近，他在中国的商务接触中，中国有关人士和工作方式无变化。
    美国明尼苏达州矿产和制造公司的发言人本·马尔什先生说，从长远来说，“在中国经营前景是非常乐观的，我们没有理由改变我们的看法”。
    在中国已经营10年的奈克公司的发言人利兹·多兰说，北京的动乱并未影响该公司对中国的业务活动和业务计划。多兰指出，“肯定地说，中国是我们长期计划的一部分。我们认为，中国不仅作为制造业中心有巨大潜力，而且很明显作为一个巨大的消费市场，也有很大潜力。我们无意随意离开。”
    《纽约时报》还报道，有些美国公司对中国政治形势澄清前在中国扩展公司业务尚有犹疑，但仍然认为中国是吸引人们开展新业务的一个地方。这些美国公司也担心，如果它们减少在中国的业务，缩小发展计划，甚至决定不进入这个市场，那就会让其它外国竞争者得利。
