Marriage concepts among Guangdong youth are changing, with an increasing number of couples where the wife is older than the husband. According to survey data, among young couples aged 20 to 24, 32% have wives who are older than their husbands. Among couples aged 25 to 29, 18% have husbands who are younger than their wives. Generally, the wife is 1 to 2 years older than the husband, rarely exceeding 5 years.

Sociologists believe that this phenomenon is due to the fact that women's social status and economic independence have gradually freed them from dependence on men.

People also believe that, given that women's average lifespan is about 5 years longer than men's, having a wife who is slightly older than the husband will be beneficial for old age support, reducing the number of days elderly women have to live independently.

    广东婚姻新趋势——
    “男小女大”
    广东青年婚姻观念发生变化，女方比男方大的夫妇越来越多。据调查资料显示：低龄组20岁至24岁的青年夫妇中，女大于男的达32％；25岁至29岁的夫妇中，丈夫小于妻子的占18％。女方一般大男方1至2岁，很少超过5岁。
    社会学家认为，出现这种现象的原因是当今妇女的社会地位与经济独立能力已逐渐摆脱依从男性地位。
    人们还认为：现实中女性平均寿命比男性约长5岁，夫妇年龄女方略大于男方，将有利于老有所依，缩短老年女性的独立日子。
