Theft of Famous European and American Paintings Becomes Common
Ding Gang

	“It was four years ago on a Sunday morning. The museum had just opened when they rushed in with guns, and in an instant, they stole nine famous paintings. Those robbers were experts in art; after they left, the museum was left with nothing but an empty name.” The owner of the gift shop at the Paris Montmartre Museum often tells visitors this story. Now, the gift shop displays replicas of those nine paintings, the most eye-catching being the oil painting “Impression: Sunrise” by the French Impressionist master Claude Monet. Meanwhile, at an auction, Monet’s works have sold for as much as $14.3 million.

	On one hand, there are increasingly creative and frequent cases of art theft; on the other hand, the art market is booming, and collectors are eager to acquire pieces. On May 9 this year, at a famous Sotheby’s auction, a self-portrait by Picasso sold for $47.9 million. A French police officer responsible for handling art theft cases, DeFoe, said, “This is logical. Anything that can generate money is of interest to criminals.”

	The International Art Research Institute based in New York has been recording cases of art theft and robbery since 1976. By the end of 1979, the number of cases was 1,300, and now it has exceeded 30,000. In January of this year, a fashionable couple pushed a baby carriage into the Madison Avenue Gallery in New York. After they left, the manager discovered that a work by Picasso had vanished. This method of theft is still relatively civilized. In recent years, armed robberies like the one at the Montmartre Museum are not uncommon. Currently, the “art thief” Barnes, who is being tried in the United States, used machine guns to commit his robberies.

	Thieves’ techniques are also becoming more sophisticated. On the night of May 21, 1986, a gang of thieves broke into a heavily guarded estate in Ireland. They cleverly disabled the infrared security system and stole 11 famous paintings, creating one of the largest art thefts in recent years.

	Faced with increasingly rampant art thieves, many museums, despite financial constraints, have to spend large sums of money on installing security facilities. Sometimes, when museums need to hold exhibitions in other cities, they have to be even more careful. Some French museums often transport exhibits separately, sometimes even sending them one by one via train, car, and airplane to the destination.

	The police have discovered that many stolen artworks are transported underground to other countries and then sold legally in art shops or at auctions with complete documentation. Art dealers in some European cities often encounter people selling famous paintings on small streets, but they usually neither want to buy nor dare to report to the police. They know, “Those guys are not to be trifled with.”

	To combat art thieves, countries like France and Italy have established specialized departments. Nevertheless, the crime rate is still rising sharply, and the police are struggling to cope. France’s clearance rate in recent years is less than 30%, and Italy is only around 50%. More telling is that thieves sometimes deliberately commit crimes under the noses of the police. In front of the police headquarters in Italy, which specializes in dealing with art thieves, there is a church that has been robbed four times in four years. The police even estimate that some famous paintings may never be recovered, as thieves might have sold the original paintings in parts.

	Many famous paintings have been stolen for years and have vanished without a trace. If the thieves are not in a hurry for money, they will not easily sell them.

	Everyone knows that famous paintings are like aged wine; the longer they are kept, the more valuable they become. If they eventually fall into the hands of a collector or connoisseur, it will be even harder to return them to their rightful owners.

    欧美名画失窃成风
    丁刚
    “那是4年前的一个星期天的早晨，博物馆刚刚开门，他们就拿着枪冲了进来，一下子就抢走了9幅名画。那些抢劫者们简直是精通艺术的行家，他们离去后，博物馆也就徒有虚名了。”巴黎蒙马丹博物馆礼品店的老板常常会对游客们这样说。如今，礼品店里摆着的就是那9幅名画的复制品，最引人注目的是法国印象派大师莫奈的油画《印象：日出》。与此同时，在拍卖行，莫奈的作品已经卖到了1430万美元。
    一面是艺术品失窃案花样翻新，层出不穷；一面是艺术品市场行情看涨，搜集者趋之若鹜。今年5月9日，在著名的苏斯比拍卖行的一次拍卖中，毕加索的一幅自画像卖到了4790万美元。负责处理艺术品偷盗案的法国警官笛福说：“这很符合逻辑，能产生金钱的东西总是罪犯们感兴趣的东西。”
    设在纽约的国际艺术研究会从1976年开始登记艺术品失窃和抢劫事件，1979年底的数字是1300件，现已超过3万件。今年1月，一对打扮入时的夫妇推着一辆童车光顾了纽约麦迪森大街画廊，他们离去后，管理人员忽然发现毕加索的一幅作品不翼而飞。这种偷法还算是比较文明的。近年来，像蒙马丹博物馆发生的武装抢劫案并非鲜见。目前正在美国接受审判的“艺术大盗”巴尼斯就是使用机关枪进行抢劫的。
    盗贼们的作案技术也越来越高明。1986年5月21日夜，一伙盗贼来到爱尔兰戒备森严的一座庄园，他们巧妙地破坏了红外线防盗装置，偷走了11幅名画，制造了近年来最大的一次艺术品盗窃事件。
    面对日益猖獗的艺术盗贼，不少博物馆尽管存在经费不足的问题，也不得不耗费巨资安装防盗设施。有时，博物馆要到外地办展览，就更得格外小心。法国的一些博物馆往往将展品分开运输，有时甚至是一件一件分别通过火车、汽车和飞机运到目的地。
    警方发现，有不少艺术品被盗后经过地下运输网运到别国，又以手续俱全的面目在艺术品商店里合法出售或在拍卖行里拍卖。艺术商们在欧洲一些城市的小街道上也会碰到有人兜售名画，可他们往往是既不愿买，也不敢报告警方。他们知道，“那些家伙不好惹”。
    为了对付艺术盗贼，法国、意大利等国已设立了专职部门。尽管如此，发案率仍在直线上升，警方难以应付。法国近年来的破案率还不到30％，意大利也不过是接近50％。更能说明问题的是，盗贼们有时会故意在警方眼皮底下作案，在意大利专门对付艺术盗贼的警察总部对面有一所教堂，4年来这所教堂被盗了4次。警方甚至估计，有些名画早已无法完璧归赵，盗贼们可能已将原画分成几部分出售了。
    许多名画被盗多年，杳无踪影。假如盗贼们并不急着用钱的话，他们是不会轻易出手的。
    谁都知道，名画就像陈年的老酒一样，时间越长越值钱。要是它最终落到了一个收藏家或鉴赏家手里，那就更难物归原主了。
