The Taiwan edition of the *Independent Evening News* reported that according to a survey, there are 1,694 surnames among Taiwanese residents, with the 10 most common surnames accounting for more than half of the total population.

These 10 most common surnames are Chen, Lin, Huang, Zhang, Li, Wang, Wu, Liu, Cai, and Yang.

The "Taiwan Provincial Literature Committee" has researched the origins of these 10 surnames and found that most can be traced back to the central plains of mainland China. For example, the Chen surname has clan names such as Yingchuan and Ruyang, which are now part of Henan Province; the Huang surname has clan names such as Jiangxia and Ziyun, which are now part of Hubei Province, and so on.

    台湾姓氏谈
    台《自立晚报》报道说，据调查，台湾居民现有1694个姓氏，其中常见的有10大姓，人员占总人口的半数以上。
    这10大姓为陈、林、黄、张、李、王、吴、刘、蔡、杨。
  “台湾省文献委员会”曾经为这10大姓的堂号考查源流，发现大多数均溯源于大陆中原地区。如陈姓，堂号颖川、汝南等，为现今的河南省；黄姓，堂号江夏、紫云，为现今的湖北省等等。
