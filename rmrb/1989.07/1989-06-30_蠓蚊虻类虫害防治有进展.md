The military medical research institute of the Beijing Military Area Command, with the support of relevant higher authorities, conducted a two-year large-scale systematic investigation and research on the distribution, life habits, blood-sucking characteristics, and nesting behaviors of biting Diptera in the border regions near China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia. Recently, significant scientific research achievements have been made.

The biting flies such as black flies, mosquitoes, and horse flies in the border regions between China, the Soviet Union, and Mongolia not only bite humans and livestock but also spread many diseases. For a long time, the local population has suffered from the lack of effective prevention and control methods, and the pest infestations have caused great harm to the border military and civilians. The researchers at the military medical research institute of the Beijing Military Area Command have finally proposed corresponding prevention and control measures.
