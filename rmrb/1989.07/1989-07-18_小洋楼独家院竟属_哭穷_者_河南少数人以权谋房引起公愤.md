	Recently, while conducting interviews in various prefectures and cities in Henan Province, reporters discovered a peculiar phenomenon: some party and government officials complain bitterly about their salaries, yet when it comes to building private homes and villas, they are extravagant and grand. This stark contrast between income and expenditure among party and government officials who build private homes has sparked strong dissatisfaction among the public.

	In places like Jiaozuo, Zhoukou, and Xinxiang in Henan Province, reporters saw that the private homes and villas built by some party and government officials are mostly small Western-style houses with separate courtyards. The interiors are quite luxurious, equipped with reception rooms, basements, bathrooms, and more.

	In addition to leaders, those who build private homes the most are people with power and influence, as well as those who manage money and materials. This includes officials and staff from public security, taxation, banking, materials, supply and marketing departments, as well as leaders from industrial and mining enterprises.

	According to China's current distribution system, the salaries of party and government officials are relatively low. How is it that a few people can build such luxurious private homes? Some informed officials and masses privately told reporters: The key lies in the word "power." The exchange of power for money and power for goods, these corrupt practices that everyone despises, have almost become an open "secret" in the increasingly prevalent trend of officials building private homes.

	Not long ago, the disciplinary inspection and land departments of Henan Province conducted a survey in Jiaozuo City, which confirmed the public's reports.

	According to incomplete statistics, among the 2,761 households of officials and staff who built private homes in this city over the past three years, most people have, to varying degrees, engaged in behaviors that infringe on state and collective interests.

    小洋楼独家院竟属“哭穷”者 
    河南少数人以权谋房引起公愤
    据新华社郑州7月18日电  （记者郭献文、王耕）记者最近在河南省一些地、市采访时了解到一个怪现象：一些党政干部谈起自己的工资收入时叫苦不迭，建起私房和别墅来却财大气粗，十分气派。这种反映在党政干部大建私房中的日益悬殊的收支反差，已引起群众强烈不满。
    在河南省焦作、周口、新乡等地、市，记者看到一些党政干部盖起的私房和别墅大都是小洋楼、独家院，内部设施也颇为豪华，会客室、地下室、洗浴间等一应俱全。
    除领导干部外，建私房较多的还有有权有势和管钱管物的人，如公安、税务、银行、物资、供销部门的干部职工和工矿企业领导。
    按照我国现行分配制度，党政机关干部的工资收入是偏低的，少数人建起私房来为何这般阔气呢？一些知情的干部群众私下告诉记者：这里面关键是一个“权”字。权钱交易、权物互换，这些为大家切齿痛恨的腐败现象，在愈演愈烈的干部建私房风中几乎已成为公开的“秘密”。
    河南省纪检、土地等部门不久前在焦作市进行的一次摸底调查，证实了群众的反映。
    据不完全统计，在这个市近3年间营建私房的2761户干部职工中，大多数人都不同程度地存在着侵占国家和集体利益的行为。
