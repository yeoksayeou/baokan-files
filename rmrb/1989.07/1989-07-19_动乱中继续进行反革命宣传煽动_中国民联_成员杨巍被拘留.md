	Counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement continued during the turmoil. A member of the "Chinese Alliance for Democracy," Yang Wei, has been detained.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Shanghai on July 18, Yang Wei, a member of the reactionary organization "Chinese Alliance for Democracy" who had previously served time for counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, continued to engage in counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement under the name of "Chinese Alliance for Democracy" during the recent turmoil. He was detained by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau today.

	According to the public security authorities, after being released from prison, Yang Wei worked as a translator in a factory. He showed no signs of repentance and continued to hold his reactionary stance. During the period when his political rights were revoked, he reestablished contact with the "Chinese Alliance for Democracy" and provided information. During the recent student movements and turmoil in Shanghai, Yang Wei infiltrated university campuses and student protest and hunger strike groups, gathering information. He made multiple long-distance calls to report his activities to Hu Ping, the chairman of the "Chinese Alliance for Democracy" in the United States, providing lists of names and contact numbers of the leaders of the illegal organization "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students."

	Yang Wei also advised the leaders of the "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students," inciting them to resist the government.

	Given Yang Wei's illegal and criminal activities, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau detained him for investigation today.

    动乱中继续进行反革命宣传煽动
    “中国民联”成员杨巍被拘留
    据新华社上海7月18日电　（通讯员忻文轲、记者陈毛弟）记者从上海公安机关获悉，曾犯反革命宣传煽动罪的刑满释放人员、反动组织“中国民联”成员杨巍，在动乱期间，继续以“中国民联”名义进行反革命宣传煽动等犯罪活动，今天被上海公安部门依法拘留。
    据公安部门介绍，杨巍刑满释放后，在一家工厂担任翻译，他不思悔改，继续坚持反动立场，在剥夺政治权利期间，又与“中国民联”进行联系，提供情况。在上海最近发生学潮和动乱期间，杨巍混进大学校园和学生游行、绝食队伍中，收集情况，多次通过长途电话，向在美国的“中国民联”主席胡平报告他的活动进展情况，提供非法组织上海“高自联”头头名单和联络电话。杨巍还为上海“高自联”头头出谋划策，唆使他们对抗政府。
    上海公安机关鉴于杨巍的违法犯罪活动，于今天依法将杨巍拘留审查。
