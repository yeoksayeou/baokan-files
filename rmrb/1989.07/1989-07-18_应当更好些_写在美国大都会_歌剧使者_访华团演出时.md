The concert has ended. When the artists from the Metropolitan Opera of the United States were throwing flowers to the audience amidst enthusiastic applause, a friend sitting next to me asked for my evaluation of the concert. I gave my response. I also want to say that this is my personal impression after attending the concert, neither blindly praising nor deliberately belittling. Art, especially opera art, after all, has its value standards recognized by audiences around the world.

The Metropolitan Opera House is not only influential in the United States but is also one of the few world-renowned professional opera performance troupes recognized globally, with a strong lineup and abundant talent. Singers from various countries around the world generally consider it an honor to join the Metropolitan Opera House and sign performance contracts with it. Judging from the few singers who came to China this time, the performance was generally satisfactory; but compared to the reputation that the Metropolitan Opera House enjoys, there are still some regrets.

Without a doubt, the most memorable part of the entire concert was the performance by the soprano Marita Nabi. Her rich, metallic voice, smooth and flexible vocal lines, continuous and fluid breath control, high-level voice control, and dramatic volume contrasts all left a deep impression. All of these were nearly perfectly demonstrated in her rendition of "The Moonlight Serenade."

Equally impressive was Richard Ness. This tall and handsome tenor has a solid and bright voice. His performances of "They Call the Wind Maria" and "If I Had a Song" were complete and moving, full of passion, and exuded an inner artistic charm.

The tenor Frederick Court is also a well-known singer, but he seemed a bit nervous when he first took the stage, with both his voice and body appearing stiff. However, in his subsequent performances, especially in his rendition of "The Music of That Night" from the musical "The Phantom of the Opera," he obviously regained his confidence, proving his artistic prowess with a brilliant voice. The soprano Jane Torren, who performed "The Drinking Song" from "La Traviata" with him, has a pure, sweet, and lyrical voice. Unfortunately, her stage presence and performance were noticeably constrained, which inevitably weakened her artistic appeal. The mezzo-soprano Joan Grillo's passionate and exuberant performance, the baritone Dominique Cosse's rigorous and dignified performance, the bass Mario Bertorino's humorous performance, and their well-trained voices and distinctive performances all added vibrant colors to the concert. What I found unsatisfying was that the performances of these artists seemed to lack a bit of spirit and luster, lacking that magical power to control and conquer the audience.

However, what I found most regrettable about the entire evening was the performance by the pianist Gary DiPasquale. It seems that his performance technique has not yet reached a mature level. Especially in the opening duet "The Drinking Song," his accompaniment was hurried and clumsy. Such roughness appearing in a concert by Metropolitan Opera artists is truly surprising.

For this type of chamber music concert, meticulous craftsmanship and perfect coordination are probably the most basic requirements. I believe this requirement was relatively well met in the quartet from "Rigoletto." The performance of the five artists, including the piano accompaniment, was excellent and moving. The melodic lines of each voice part were clear, the characters were distinct, and the overall musical effect was strong and harmonious, truly bringing out the dramatic content and musical beauty unique to Verdi's famous opera quartet.

Chinese audiences not only love their own music and theater but also appreciate excellent opera works and vocal performances from various countries around the world. Over the past ten years, exchanges and cooperation between Chinese and foreign opera artists have become increasingly frequent. As an audience member, I sincerely hope that such exchanges and cooperation will be further expanded and improved in quality, enriching the spiritual life of Chinese audiences.

    应当更好些
    ——写在美国大都会“歌剧使者”访华团演出时
    欧阳照
    音乐会已经结束。当美国大都会艺术家们在热烈掌声中向观众抛掷鲜花的时候，邻座一位朋友问我对这场音乐会评价如何，我就作了回答。我还要说，这是我个人听完音乐会的真实感受，既不盲目吹捧，也不故意贬损。艺术，尤其是歌剧艺术，毕竟是有其被各国观众认同的价值标准的。
    大都会歌剧院，不仅在美国，即使在全世界也是有影响的公认的少数几个世界专业歌剧表演团体之一，阵容强大，人才济济。世界各国的美声歌唱家大都把能够加盟大都会歌剧院、与它签订演出合同引为骄傲。从这次组团访华的几位歌唱家来看，表演基本上是令人满意的；但与大都会歌剧院所拥有的声誉相比，却或多或少存在着某些遗憾。
    不用说，整场音乐会中最令人难忘的是女高音歌唱家马丽塔·纳比亚的演唱。醇厚的金属般的音色，行腔的委婉自如，气息的贯通与流畅，高难度的声音控制和音量的大幅度对比，都给人以深刻印象。这一切，在她演唱的《月亮颂》中得到了近乎完美的体现。
    与纳比亚并驾齐驱的是理查·尼斯。这位男高音歌唱家形象高大，气质雄健，声音坚实而明亮，他演唱的《他们把那吹来的风叫马丽亚》《如果没有歌声》完整动人、热情洋溢，有一种内在的艺术魅力充溢其间。
    男高音弗莱德里克·考特也是一位有名的歌唱家，但他一开始登台时看来有些紧张，从声音到形体都有些僵硬，但在后来的几轮演唱中，尤其在演唱音乐剧《歌剧印象》选曲《那晚的音乐会》时，他显然恢复了自信，以辉煌的声音证明了自己的艺术实力。与他配对唱《茶花女》的《祝酒歌》的女高音是简·托伦，她的声音纯净、甜美、抒情，可惜台风和表演明显拘谨，这就不能不削弱了她的艺术感染力。女中音歌唱家琼·格里洛的热情奔放、男中音歌唱家多米尼克·科萨的严谨和庄重、男低音歌唱家马里奥·伯托里诺的富于幽默感以及他们训练有素的歌喉、各具特点的演唱，均为音乐会增添了斑斓绚丽的色调。使我感到不满足的是，这几位艺术家的演唱似乎少了点灵气和光采，缺乏那种支配听众、征服听众的神奇的魔力。
    但整台晚会最使我感到遗憾的是钢琴家加里·迪帕斯夸西奥的演奏。看来他的演奏技术尚未达到成熟的境界。尤其在开场二重唱《祝酒歌》中，他的伴奏慌慌张张，跌跌撞撞，这样的粗糙竟然出现在大都会艺术家的音乐会中，实在令人吃惊。
    对于这类室内音乐会，精雕细刻配合默契恐怕是最起码的要求。我认为这个要求得到较完满体现的是《弄臣》四重唱。包括钢琴伴奏在内的五位艺术家的表演是优秀而动人的。各个声部的旋律线条清晰，角色个性鲜明，而综合音乐效果又非常强烈和谐，确实把威尔第这首著名的歌剧四重唱所特有的戏剧内涵和音乐美质较好地揭示出来了。
    中国观众不但热爱本国的音乐戏剧，而且也热爱世界各国的优秀歌剧作品和声乐表演艺术。十年来，中外歌剧艺术家之间的交流与合作日见频繁。作为一名观众，我衷心希望这种交流与合作更加扩大，更加讲究质量，以丰富中国观众的精神生活。
