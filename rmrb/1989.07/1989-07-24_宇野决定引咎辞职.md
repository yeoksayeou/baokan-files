People's Daily, Tokyo, July 24th. Correspondent Yu Qing reports: Japanese Prime Minister Ueno Sozu, who had been in office for only 52 days, announced this morning at an emergency press conference held at the Liberal Democratic Party headquarters that he would resign from his positions as Prime Minister and LDP President to take responsibility for the party's defeat in the House of Councillors election.

Ueno told reporters, "This election was extremely difficult. Issues such as the Recruit scandal, the consumption tax, and criticism of agricultural policies have created a series of challenges." He added, "The people have made their judgment in the election, and we must humbly listen and reflect. The entire responsibility for this election defeat lies with me. Therefore, I have decided to resign from my positions as Prime Minister and President to clearly take responsibility. I will entrust the party to quickly select a new president. I hope the party and the Diet will fully consult and avoid political turmoil. The domestic political process and foreign relations should not change the current policies."

The LDP's crushing defeat in the House of Councillors election has shaken the Japanese political landscape, and the political situation in Japan is once again in turmoil.
