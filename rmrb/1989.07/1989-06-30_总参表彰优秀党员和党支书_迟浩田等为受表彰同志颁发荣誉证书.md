The General Staff Department's units in Beijing and its affiliated units held a grand ceremony to commemorate the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China on the eve of July 1. The ceremony honored 40 outstanding party members and 28 outstanding party branch secretaries. General Staff Chief Xiong Guangkai and other leaders presented certificates of honor to the awardees.

The outstanding party members and party branch secretaries honored by the General Staff Department are representatives of the many outstanding party members and grassroots party workers who have emerged in various fronts of the General Staff Department in recent years, especially during the current struggle against turmoil and the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Lin Yongnian, a researcher at a certain research institute and a model soldier of the entire army, is a scholar who joined the party in the 1950s. After returning from studying abroad, he dedicated several decades to the defense science and technology front, achieving many major scientific research results. Despite being diagnosed with cancer, he continues to fight on the front lines of scientific research. Ding Hongbo, a college student who recently joined the party at a certain military academy, participated in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion during his graduation internship and completed the tasks assigned by the party excellently, writing an outstanding "graduation thesis" with his actions. Guo Xiangjian, the party branch secretary and political instructor of a certain unit's company, led the troops to perform guard duties at New China Gate and other locations. With a resolute determination to defend the Party Central Committee at the cost of their lives, they endured humiliation, stood firm at their posts, and defended the dignity of the Republic with their blood and lives. Their advanced deeds were met with enthusiastic applause from the attendees.

At the commendation meeting, the General Staff Department Party Committee called on all party members to learn from the honorees' strong party spirit, firm revolutionary stance, high political awareness, and unyielding dedication, and to maintain the honorable character of communists. Deputy Chief of the General Staff Xu Huizhi, on behalf of the General Staff Department Party Committee, also proposed specific requirements for implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee and strengthening the party building of the General Staff Department.

Additionally, on June 29, 600 new party members and 1,000 new league members of the General Staff Department held a solemn oath-taking ceremony in the rain at the majestic Tiananmen Square, vowing to strive for communism for life. Deputy Chiefs of the General Staff Xu Xin and Xu Huizhi attended the oath-taking ceremony.
