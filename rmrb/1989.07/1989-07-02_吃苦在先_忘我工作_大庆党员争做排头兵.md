Daqing Municipal Party Committee Secretary Zhang Hong recently said in an interview with reporters: "Now, the more than 50,000 Communist Party members in Daqing's 100-mile oil field are still like they were during the initial campaign, taking the lead in hardships and working selflessly. Last year, 22,000 party members in the entire oil field were rated as advanced individuals at various levels, and it is estimated that this year there will be even more party members who will become advanced individuals at various levels." He said, "The 30-year history of Daqing is actually a history of hard struggle."

In the 30 years since the development and construction of Daqing, the cumulative production of crude oil has reached nearly 1 billion tons, and the amount remitted to the treasury has reached 7.077 billion yuan, equivalent to 22 times the state's investment; the former wasteland has given birth to and nurtured a Chinese enterprise with a total asset value of over 10 billion yuan.

Daqing has now become a bustling oil city, but in the wild production frontline, production and living conditions are still very harsh, with 20,000 party members firmly rooted there like nails. In the past two years, the entire oil field has had more than 240 Communist Party members leave the bustling city center and voluntarily go to the most remote and harsh new areas to participate in development and construction.

In recent years, despite being impacted from various sides, the Daqing Oilfield Party Committee has taken strengthening party organizations and educating party members on hard struggle as the focus of their work. The tradition of "having a party branch in the team and a party member in the class" has been maintained. In just 1987, the Daqing Oilfield Party Committee dispatched more than 5,000 party member cadres from the headquarters to the grassroots level. To comprehensively improve the quality of party members, the oil field's party committees at various levels have also established nearly 100 part-time party schools.

Since April this year, during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the Beijing area, due to the full play of the leading role by party organizations and party members at all levels, the workers resolutely withstood external influences, remained firmly on their posts, and ensured the stability of production, life, and social order. The crude oil production in June basically maintained the production level of the same period last year.

    吃苦在先　忘我工作
    大庆党员争做排头兵
    据新华社哈尔滨7月2日电　（本社记者蒋耀波、顾万明，《黑龙江日报》记者张福宽）大庆市委书记张轰日前在接受记者采访时说：现在，大庆百里油田上的5万多名共产党员依然像会战初期那样，吃苦在先，忘我工作。去年全油田有2.2万名党员被评为各级先进个人，预计今年将有更多党员成为各级先进个人。他说，这一事实雄辩地表明：“大庆30年的历史，实际上就是一部艰苦奋斗的历史。”
    大庆开发建设30年来，累计生产原油已近10亿吨，上缴财政达707.7亿元，相当于国家投资的22倍；昔日的荒原上诞生、壮大了资产总额达上百亿的中国企业之王。
    大庆现已成为一座繁华的石油城，但在野外生产第一线，生产、生活条件仍然十分艰苦，有2万名党员像钉子一样牢牢地钉在那里。近两年，全油田共有240多名共产党员离开繁华的城市中心，主动到最边远、最艰苦的新区参加开发建设。
    近几年，尽管受到来自各方面的冲击，大庆油田党委把健全党组织和对党员进行艰苦奋斗等方面的教育作为工作的重点。“队里有支部，班上有党员”的传统一直坚持。仅1987年，大庆油田党委就从机关抽调了5000多名党员干部下到基层。为了全面提高党员素质，油田各级党委还办起了近百所业余党校。
    今年4月以来，在北京地区发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，由于各级党组织和党员充分发挥带头作用，职工们坚决顶住了外来影响，始终坚守在岗位上，保证了生产、生活和社会秩序的稳定。6月份原油产量基本保持去年同期的生产水平。
