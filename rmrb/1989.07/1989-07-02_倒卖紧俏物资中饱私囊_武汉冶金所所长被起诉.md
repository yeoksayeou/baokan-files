Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 2nd

The director of the Wuhan Metallurgical Institute, Gui Guangqing, has been indicted by the Wuhan Municipal Procuratorate on charges of speculation and bribery. Gui is accused of profiteering from the sale of scarce national resources, amassing over 400,000 yuan for himself.

Gui Guangqing, who serves as the director of the Wuhan Metallurgical Institute, a member of the Wuhan Municipal Political Consultative Conference, and a vice-chairman of the Jianghan District Political Consultative Conference, allowed his greed to cloud his judgment. In July 1988, taking advantage of the domestic market's shortage of nickel plates, Gui, using his position as the director of the Wuhan Metallurgical Institute, bribed a relevant department official by giving the official's child a gold ring, inviting the official on a trip, and hiring the official's wife as a consultant for a monthly salary of 500 yuan. Through these means, Gui obtained a quota for 30 tons of nickel plates allocated by the Ministry of Metallurgy to his institute. He falsely claimed that 5 tons had been approved by relevant Ministry of Metallurgy officials to be transferred to a certain general electrical company in Changsha, keeping the 5 tons of nickel plate quota under his control. He then sold the nickel plates at a high price on two separate occasions. Gui illegally gained 403,110 yuan from this.

Additionally, Gui sold the institute's imported nickel plates, priced at over 40,000 yuan per ton, to Zhou Tianzhen and others at 103,000 yuan per ton. After Zhou Tianzhen and others made a profit, they gave Gui 13,000 yuan. After Zhou Tianzhen and others were caught, Gui returned the money to cover up his own crimes.

During the Wuhan Municipal Procuratorate's investigation into Gui's bribery case, Gui sensed that something was amiss and turned himself in, confessing to his crimes.

Currently, Wuhan's judicial authorities have arrested Gui and recovered 335,000 yuan in illicit funds and two tons of valuable Chinese medicine, Beimu, worth 80,000 yuan. The case is currently being further reviewed by the Wuhan Municipal People's Court.

    倒卖紧俏物资中饱私囊  武汉冶金所所长被起诉
    新华社武汉7月2日电（记者熊金超）倒卖国家紧俏物资牟暴利、将40余万元中饱私囊的桂广庆，最近已被武汉市人民检察院以投机倒把罪、受贿罪向市中级人民法院提起公诉。
    桂广庆系武汉市冶金研究所所长、武汉市政协常委、武汉市江汉区政协副主席。身为共产党员的桂广庆利欲熏心，他于1988年7月，趁国内市场镍板奇缺之机，以武汉市冶金研究所所长的身份，采取向国家有关部门某工作人员子女赠送金戒指、邀请旅游以及以月薪500元聘请这位工作人员的妻子充当顾问等手段，弄到了冶金部下拨给这个所的30吨镍板计划指标。他谎称其中5吨已经冶金部有关人员同意转拨给长沙某通用电器公司，将5吨镍板指标控制在自己手中，先后两次高价倒卖。桂广庆非法获利40.311万元。
    此外，桂广庆还将该所进口的每吨4万余元的镍板以每吨10.3万元的价格，批给周天真等人炒卖，周天真等获利后送给桂广庆1.3万元。周天真等人的案发后，桂广庆便将款退回，以掩盖自己的罪行。
    在武汉市人民检察院就桂广庆受贿案进行调查的过程中，桂广庆感到事情不妙，便向检察机关自首，如实交待了他的罪行。
    目前，武汉市司法机关已将桂广庆依法逮捕，并追回赃款33.5万余元和价值8万元的两吨中药材贝母。此案正由武汉市人民法院进一步审理。
