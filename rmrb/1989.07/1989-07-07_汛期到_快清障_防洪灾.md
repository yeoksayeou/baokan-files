The flood season is approaching, and it is crucial to quickly remove obstacles to prevent flood disasters. Within our city's jurisdiction, along the Yangtze River and Qingjiang River embankments, there are persistent issues of illegal constructions, disorderly piles of items, and obstacles to water flow. These problems hinder the pre-flood season work of clearing obstacles and mitigating risks.

In the jurisdiction of the Zhi Cheng Street Office, the embankments along the river are critical sections for water flow. However, coal is often piled up like mountains on these embankments, forming a "coal embankment." The management department of the wharf only focuses on collecting fees and earning money, ignoring the safety of the embankments, thus creating a major risk of embankment collapse and breaches. The old obstacles at the Qingjiang Bridge head have not been removed, and new ones have been set up. The municipal shipping company has newly constructed five warehouses near this bridge, covering an area of 140 square meters. The urban traffic management station has built a new guardhouse under the 2nd pier. Additionally, two suspension piers have been constructed at the bridge head, and the piles of coal and sand far exceed those of last year, causing two out of the seven spans of the bridge to be severely obstructed by water flow.

Setting up obstacles to water flow directly threatens the safety of national property and people's lives. Relevant departments should take measures to educate those who set up obstacles to understand the bigger picture and prioritize the overall situation, urging them to remove obstacles to water flow within a specified time. For those who repeatedly ignore warnings and continue to set up obstacles, the responsible units and individuals should be punished according to the law to ensure unobstructed water flow and avoid man-made "flood disasters."

    汛期到  快清障  防洪灾
    我市境内长江、清江堤垸上，违章建筑、乱堆乱放东西、设置行洪障碍的现象屡禁不止，影响汛期前的清障排险工作。
    枝城街道办事处辖区内的沿江大堤，本是行洪险段，但堤上原煤经常堆积如山，形成一道“煤堤”。码头管理部门只顾收费要钱，无视堤身安危，造成倒堤溃口的重大隐患。清江大桥桥头旧障未除，又设新障。市轮船公司在这座大桥附近，占滩新建仓库5间，面积140平方米，陆城交通管理站在2号桥墩下新建1间值班房。同时，大桥边还建造了两处吊脚码头，桥头上原煤、砂石堆积量大大超过去年，致使7个孔的大桥有2个孔严重阻洪。
    乱设行洪障碍，直接威胁着国家财产和人民生命的安全。有关部门应采取措施，教育设障者识大体、顾大局，让他们限期清除行洪障碍；对屡教不听、有禁不止、我行我素的设障单位和责任人要依法惩处，以确保行洪无障，避免人为造成“洪灾”。
