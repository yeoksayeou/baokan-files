South Korean authorities have for the first time decided to allow civilians to visit North Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 22nd: According to a broadcast by the South Korean radio station today, the "National Unification Board" of South Korea approved Pastor Lee Dae-jun's visit to North Korea on the 20th. This is the first time South Korean authorities have allowed civilians to visit the North.

Lee Dae-jun is a South Korean resident in Japan. Recently, he applied to the South Korean authorities to visit North Korea for religious activities.

On the 20th, Lee Hong-gu, the director of the "National Unification Board," chaired the 4th meeting of the "Promotion of South-North Exchange and Cooperation Agreement," and decided to allow Lee Dae-jun to visit the North. Lee Dae-jun will depart for Pyongyang on the 25th.

South Korean authorities require all South Koreans visiting the North to obtain approval. In March and April of this year, Pastor Mun Yeong-hwan visited North Korea without approval, and the authorities arrested him on charges of "violating the National Security Law" and put him on trial.

    南朝鲜当局首次决定允许民间人士访北方
    新华社平壤7月22日电  据南朝鲜广播电台今天广播，南朝鲜“国土统一院”20日批准牧师李大俊访问朝鲜北方。这是南朝鲜当局首次允许民间人士访问北方。
    李大俊是旅居日本的南朝鲜人。不久前，他向南朝鲜当局申请到朝鲜北方进行宗教活动。
    南朝鲜“国土统一院”长官李洪九20日主持“促进南北交流合作协议会”第4次会议，作出了允许李大俊访问北方的决定。李大俊将于7月25日前往平壤。
    南朝鲜当局要求所有访问北方的南朝鲜人要经过批准。今年3、4月间，南朝鲜牧师文益焕未经批准访问北方后，当局以“违反《国家保安法》”为由，将他逮捕，并对他进行审判。
