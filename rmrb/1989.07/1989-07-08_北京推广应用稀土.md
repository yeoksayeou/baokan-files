The People's Daily, Beijing, July 8th.

    Beijing's agricultural application of rare earth elements has developed rapidly. Over the past four years, the city has cumulatively promoted the use of rare earth elements in 15 types of crops across 350,000 mu (approximately 23,333 hectares), generating economic benefits of 500 to 700 million yuan.

    Beijing began large-scale promotion of rare earth element applications in 1986. Last year, districts such as Tongxian, Daxing, Fangshan, and Shunyi applied rare earth elements to 125,000 mu of wheat, achieving an average increase of 41.2 kilograms per mu, with the highest increase reaching 55.4 kilograms per mu. The city's total wheat yield increased by 5.15 million kilograms. In Daxing, Tongxian, and Shunyi, the application of rare earth elements to watermelons resulted in a 17% to 18% increase in yield per mu, a 0.5 to 1 degree increase in sugar content, and an earlier harvest by about 10 days.
