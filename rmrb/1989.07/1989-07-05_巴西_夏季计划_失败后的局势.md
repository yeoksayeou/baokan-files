The Brazilian government announced on June 15 that the "Summer Plan" could not be achieved and decided to resume the implementation of the economic indexation policy, with the currency depreciating slightly every day and the prices of most goods being liberalized. Thus, the "Summer Plan," which the Brazilian government had carefully designed, failed just like the two economic adjustment plans in 1986 and 1987.

The "Summer Plan," which began on January 15, was considered the last attempt by the Sarney government to curb inflation and stabilize the economy. The plan froze prices and wages while taking a series of administrative and fiscal measures to reduce the public deficit and ensure market stability. The plan's first two months saw good results, with the government practicing fiscal restraint, reducing expenditures, and lowering the monthly inflation rate from 28% in December of the previous year to below 5%. There was no panic buying in the market.

However, because important measures such as the abolition of some government departments, the reduction of 60,000 civil servants, and the privatization of state-owned enterprises were not approved by the parliament, the entire plan could not be fully implemented. The public deficit continued to grow, and the government had to issue more currency, causing the inflation rate to rise month by month since May. Meanwhile, industrial production continued to decline. Businessmen called for the immediate liberalization of prices, otherwise, they would not be able to maintain production due to high costs. Many goods were in short supply, and even eggs, which were usually abundant, became hard to find. The working class frequently went on strike, demanding wage increases to compensate for the losses caused by price hikes. In April, there were 367 strikes nationwide, involving more than 4 million people. Under these circumstances, the "Summer Plan" could no longer be sustained. Brazil's Finance Minister Danobreka pointed out that the failure of this plan once again proved that without the support and trust of the parliament, businessmen, laborers, and society, any economic plan by the government would not succeed.

After the liberalization of prices, Brazil once again faces the threat of high inflation. Official estimates suggest that the inflation rate for July will exceed 30%. Currently, the monthly interest rate for short-term deposits in the currency market is as high as 44%. In September, Brazil needs to repay nearly $3 billion in foreign debt interest. If an agreement cannot be reached with the International Monetary Fund, the $4.8 billion loan scheduled for Brazil this year will not be realized, and Brazil may again default on its debt payments.

Despite the severe economic situation, the Brazilian government still has the means to prevent price controls. This is because from January to May this year, Brazil's foreign trade exports have continued to grow, foreign exchange reserves are approximately $6 billion, and the fiscal deficit is still within the control target. Additionally, this year's agricultural harvest is bountiful.

Politically, the failure of the "Summer Plan" further weakened public confidence in the government. Some political party candidates pointed out that the current government is no longer capable of solving the country's economic crisis and called for President Sarney to step down early. However, since the current government's term has only nine months left, stepping down early would require amending the constitution. Therefore, unless there is a special situation, the possibility of the current government stepping down early is not high. President Sarney has stated that he will continue until the end of his term.

The Sarney government's attempts to achieve economic success are difficult. However, since all political parties and the broad masses of the people hope for a smooth government transition and the consolidation of the democratic process, coupled with the stability of the military, there will generally not be major disturbances.

### 巴西“夏季计划”失败后的局势

    巴西“夏季计划”失败后的局势
    新华社记者　杨立民
    巴西政府六月十五日宣布“夏季计划”难以实现，决定恢复实行经济指数化政策，货币再度每天小幅度贬值，大部分商品价格放开。至此，巴西政府精心设计的“夏季计划”又像一九八六年和一九八七年的两次经济调整计划一样地失败了。
    今年一月十五日开始实行的“夏季计划”被认为是萨尔内政府为遏制通货膨胀、稳定经济所做的最后一次努力。该计划在冻结物价和工资的同时还采取了一系列削减公共赤字、保证市场稳定的行政和财政措施。计划执行的头两个月效果不错，政府量入为出，开支减少，月通货膨胀率从去年十二月份的百分之二十八下降到百分之五以下，市场上也未出现抢购风。
    但是，由于计划中关于取消一些政府部门、裁减六万名公务员和国营企业私有化等重要措施未获议会通过，整个计划无法全面实施。公共赤字不断增长，政府不得不多发票子，造成五月份以来通货膨胀率逐月回升。与此同时，工业生产连续下降。企业家呼吁尽快放开价格，否则将因成本过高无法维持生产，市场上许多商品缺货，过去一向供应充足的鸡蛋也难以买到。工薪阶层不
  断罢工，要求增加工资，补偿因物价上涨受到的损失。四月份，全国共发生三百六十七次罢工，参加人数达四百多万人。在这种形势下，“夏季计划”已难以为继，巴西财长达诺布雷卡指出，这次计划的失败再次证明，没有议会、企业家、劳动者和社会的支持和信任，政府的任何经济计划都不会成功。
    物价放开以后，巴西再度面临高通货膨胀的威胁。官方预测七月份的通货膨胀率将突破百分之三十。目前货币市场的短期存款月利率已高达百分之四十四。今年九月，巴西需偿付近三十亿美元的外债利息。如果不能与国际货币基金组织达成协议，今年预定给巴西的四十八亿美元贷款就无法兑现，巴西可能会因此再次停付债息。
    尽管经济形势严峻，巴西政府还有把握避免物价失控。因为，今年一至五月份，巴西外贸出口持续增长，外汇储备约为六十亿美元，财政赤字还在控制目标之内。另外，今年农业大丰收。
    在政治方面，“夏季计划”的失败进一步削弱了公众对政府的信心。一些政党的总统候选人指出，现政府已没有能力解决国家的经济危机，要求萨尔内总统提前交权。但是，由于现政府的任期只剩九个月了，提前交权还要修改宪法，所以除非出现特殊情况，否则，现政府提前交权的可能性不大，萨尔内总统已表示要坚持到任期结束。
    萨尔内政府在经济上想有所作为是很难的。但是，由于各政党和广大人民群众都希望顺利完成政府交接、巩固民主进程，加之军队稳定，一般情况下不会发生大的动乱。
