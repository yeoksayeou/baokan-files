Investigation and Reflection

Marriage Pre-examination Should Not Be a Mere Formality

Recently, I conducted an investigation into the pre-marital physical examinations of young couples in my region, and the situation is concerning.

At the outpatient department of the internal medicine ward of the 10th Army Hospital in Wuwei, 22 couples with disabled children were examined, and 3 cases were identified as hereditary diseases. One child with epilepsy, about seven or eight years old, cannot even call his parents. The child's mother said, "When I have an attack, I am worse than my son. My mother also has this disease." When asked if she had a pre-marital examination, she replied, "Someone else filled out the examination form for me." Outside the outpatient room, a young father told others, "I know my wife has a hereditary disease, and the government will not approve a second child, so we hid the family medical history."

Among young couples, very few voluntarily undergo pre-marital examinations. Since the marriage registration department implemented the policy of not issuing certificates without examinations, many people go through the motions, paying someone to get a "Qualified Examination Form" to get by. Some hospitals, after receiving the money, issue "Qualified Examination Forms." More than ten of my classmates obtained their "Marriage Examination Qualification Forms" in this way. As for young people in rural areas getting married, they simply do not have the pre-marital examination procedure.

Many people mistakenly believe that the purpose of pre-marital examinations is mainly to check if young women are virgins. Therefore, some young women who have had sexual experiences dare not go for examinations, while some young men or parents think, "How can a doctor examine my partner's body first!"

In the current situation, to ensure that pre-marital examinations are not just a formality, relevant departments still have much work to do.

    不可让婚前体检流于形式
    最近，我对我地区青年夫妇婚前体格检查情况作了调查，情况令人忧虑。
    武威第十陆军医院门诊部内科，为22对青年夫妇的病残儿进行鉴定，有3例属于遗传病。一个患癫痫的小孩，七八岁了，连爸爸、妈妈都不会叫。这个小孩的母亲说：“我犯起病来比儿子还厉害，我妈也有这个病。”医生问她婚前是否做过体检，她说：“是托人填的体检表。”在门诊室外，一位年轻父亲对别人说：“我知道我妻子患有遗传病，政府不会批准让生二胎，所以我们就把家族病史隐瞒了。”
    在年轻夫妇中，自愿进行婚前体检的极少。自从婚姻登记部门实行不体检不给登记的规定后，不少人走形式，托人交钱开一份《体检合格表》应付了事。有的医院收了钱，就出具《体检合格表》。我的10多个同学都是这样领到《结婚体检合格表》的。至于农村青年结婚，干脆没有婚前体检这一关。
    许多人错误地认为，婚前体检的目的主要是检查女青年是不是处女。因此，一些曾经有过性生活的女青年不敢去检查，而一些男青年或家长认为“怎能让大夫先看了自己对象的身子！”
    在目前情况下，要使婚前体检不流于形式，有关部门还要做许多工作。甘肃武威行署计划生育处
