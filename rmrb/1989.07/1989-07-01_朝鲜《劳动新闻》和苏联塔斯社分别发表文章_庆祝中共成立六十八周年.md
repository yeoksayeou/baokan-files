	Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 1st - Correspondent Xu Baokang reports: The Rodong Sinmun of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today published an article commemorating the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, praising the CCP as a party with a glorious tradition and rich experience. The article states that the CCP has withstood the test of struggle against imperialism and various reactionary forces at home, achieving brilliant victories.

	The article says that under the leadership of the CCP, the Chinese people, through a long and arduous domestic revolutionary war and the War of Resistance Against Japan, finally achieved national victory. For the first time in China's thousands of years of history, a genuine people's state—the People's Republic of China—was established.

	The article says that the CCP has raised the banner of self-reliance and hard struggle, actively organizing the people to invest their revolutionary enthusiasm and creativity into socialist construction, transforming the backward face of China and building a powerful new socialist state on the vast Chinese land.

	The article points out that after the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the CCP has led the Chinese people in a new struggle, achieving tremendous success in building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

	The article says that the CCP has recently led the Chinese people in crushing a counter-revolutionary rebellion, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, deepening reform and opening up, and is actively struggling to implement the resolutions of the Thirteenth National Congress and the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

	The article points out that the CCP is actively working to achieve national reunification under the principle of "one country, two systems." The Chinese party and government adhere to an independent, autonomous, and peaceful foreign policy, making a great contribution to the cause of world peace. China's strength is increasingly growing, and its international status is further enhanced.

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 30th - Tass today published a signed article commemorating the 68th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

	The article quotes the communiqué from the recently concluded Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, stating that the CCP is determined to continue the policies and principles established at the Third Plenum held in December 1978, reaffirming that China's foreign policy remains unchanged. The article points out that China will continue to develop friendly relations with other countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. The article believes that Gorbachev's official visit to China is a major event of the year, and the normalization of relations between the two parties is a significant achievement of this visit. The exchanges between the two parties will help strengthen friendly neighborly relations between the two peoples.

	The article finally emphasizes that both China and the Soviet Union believe that principles such as equality, mutual respect, and non-interference in internal affairs should be the basis for exchanges between the two parties. Exchanging situations and specific experiences in socialist construction will yield beneficial results.
