Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 13th.

The Boston branch of the American Chinese Association recently donated to the China Green Foundation.

In recent years, to support China's greening efforts and improve and protect the global ecological environment, overseas Chinese who love their country and American friendly organizations and individuals who are enthusiastic about China's greening cause have continuously donated to the China Green Foundation. Last year, organizations such as the US-China Friendship Association, the American Chinese Association, and the Washington, D.C. Chinese Community Federation donated green funds to China and launched a "One Person, One Tree" fundraising campaign among Chinese Americans to green the Chinese mainland.

    新华社北京7月13日电　（通讯员王九渊）美国全美华人协会波士顿分会最近向中国绿化基金会捐赠绿化基金。
    近年来，为了支持中国的绿化事业，改善和保护全球生态环境，广大爱国华侨及热心为中国绿化事业尽力的美国友好团体和友好人士不断向中国绿化基金会提供捐赠。去年美中友协、全美华协、美京华人各界联合会等团体就曾向我国捐赠绿化基金，并在美国华人中开展“一人一树”绿化中华大地募捐活动。
