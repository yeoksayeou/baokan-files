Pay Attention to the Phenomenon of Public Funds Bribery

Liu Ning
Dehong County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region

Currently, some individuals, in pursuit of personal gain, engage in extensive bribery. Others exploit their authority to accept bribes. People usually associate bribery with the exchange of private funds. While this practice still exists, the use of public funds for bribery is even more prevalent. Bribers themselves do not spend a penny, yet they achieve better results than those who use private funds.

The funds used for bribery are public, but the beneficiaries are ostensibly certain units, actually a few key figures. For instance, a certain company has used public funds for bribery amounting to four or five hundred thousand yuan over the past two years. The beneficiaries are specific individuals from relevant units. To avoid the pursuit of party discipline and legal consequences, bribers often disguise their actions as legitimate, making the recipients feel justified in accepting the bribes. These bribers use names like red envelopes, cooperation fees, contract bonuses, and sponsorship fees to bribe relevant personnel. For example, during the Spring Festival of 1989, a certain enterprise, in addition to sending nearly ten thousand yuan in red envelopes to the leaders of the county committee, county government, and relevant units, also dispatched a dedicated car to deliver red envelopes, famous wines, and cigarettes to the homes of certain higher-level officials and connections.

Bribers and recipients do not engage in transactions on the spot. The bribers' goal is to gain advantages. The recipients, having received favors, will provide convenience in return. Bribers and recipients understand each other without explicit communication, but they do not rush the deal. When the time is right, the bribers will make their requests to the recipients, obtaining what they desire.

Public funds bribery is a new characteristic of current bribery and illegal criminal activities, with more severe consequences than private funds bribery. The disciplinary inspection, supervision, and judicial departments should take measures to effectively stop the spread of the public funds bribery trend.

    注意公款行贿现象
    广西壮族自治区德保县  柳宁
    时下，一些人为了捞取私利，大肆行贿；一些人便利用权利，收受贿赂。关于行贿、受贿，人们通常还习惯于掏私人腰包的收买与被收买的行为。如今这种情况固然存在，但公款行贿则更盛行。行贿者本身一毛不拔，却可收到比私款行贿更好的效果。
    行贿动用的是公款，获益者表面是某单位，实际上是几个头面人物。如某公司近两年用公款行贿达四五万元，受惠者都是有关单位的个别人。行贿者为逃避党纪、法律的追究，往往给行贿行为披上合法的外衣，又让受贿者心安理得地收受贿赂。这些行贿者以红包、协作费、承包提成金、赞助费等名义向有关人员行贿。例如，1989年春节期间，某企业除了给县委、县政府和有关单位领导人送了近万元红包外，还派专车把红包、名酒名烟等送到上级某些干部和关系户家中。
    行贿者与受贿者并非当场交易。行贿者的目的在于捞到好处。受贿者受人之物，必予人以方便。行贿者与受贿者彼此心照不宣，但他们不急于成交。等到适当的时候，行贿者才会向受贿者提出要求，得到他们想要得到的东西。
    公款行贿是当前贿赂违法犯罪的新特点，其后果比私款行贿更为严重。纪检、监察、政法部门应该采取措施，有效地制止公款行贿风的蔓延。
