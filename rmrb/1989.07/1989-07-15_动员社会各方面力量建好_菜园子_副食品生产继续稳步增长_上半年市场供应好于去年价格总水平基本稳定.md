	Mobilize All Social Forces to Build Good "Vegetable Gardens"
	Secondary Food Production Continues Steady Growth
	Market Supply in the First Half of the Year Better Than Last Year, Overall Price Level Stable

	BEIJING, July 15 (Xinhua) -- According to reports from the national secondary food production work conference, which concluded today, China's secondary food production has continued to grow steadily in the first half of the year. Market supply has been better than last year, but there are also many constraints in secondary food production that cannot be ignored.

	Since the beginning of this year, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and various levels of government and relevant departments have attached great importance to the development of secondary food production. They have formulated and implemented a series of supportive policies, mobilizing all sectors of society to jointly build good "vegetable gardens" to enrich the "basket of vegetables." This has ensured that the overall production of secondary food in the first half of the year has maintained a steady growth trend.

	The overall level of livestock production has improved, and the growth rate of grass-eating livestock has accelerated. According to statistics from 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, it is estimated that by the end of June, the pig inventory was 297.738 million heads, an increase of 1.4% compared to the same period last year. Among them, the number of breeding sows was 21.863 million heads, an increase of 5.2% compared to the same period last year; pork production was 8.571 million tons, an increase of 4.4% compared to the same period last year. Statistical data also show that the inventory of large livestock in the first half of the year was 90.076 million heads, an increase of 2.9% compared to the same period last year; the sheep inventory was 124.342 million heads, an increase of 7.6% compared to the same period last year; beef and mutton production increased by 10.2% and 11.4% respectively compared to the same period last year. Statistics from 22 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions also show that the total egg production in the first half of the year was 3.004 million tons, an increase of 2.9% compared to the same period last year; the poultry inventory was 2.008 billion heads, a decrease of 4.6% compared to the same period last year.

	The aquaculture industry continues to maintain a good development momentum. According to statistics for January to June, the national aquaculture production was 4.221 million tons, an increase of 43.2 million tons compared to the same period last year, a growth of 11.4%. Among them, marine capture production was 2.179 million tons, an increase of 14.1%; marine aquaculture production was 327,000 tons, an increase of 8.7%; freshwater aquaculture production and freshwater capture production increased by 8.5% and 9.1% respectively compared to the same period last year.

	Vegetable production has increased in quantity and variety. Due to factors such as increased vegetable planting area, strengthened management, and good weather, in the first half of this year, most large and medium-sized cities have seen an increase in vegetable yield per unit area and total production.

	From the perspective of market supply, in the first half of the year, the supply of various secondary food products has increased, the product structure has further improved, the overall price level has remained stable, and some products have seen prices stabilize or even decrease. The overall sales situation is significantly better than in previous years.

    动员社会各方面力量建好“菜园子”
    副食品生产继续稳步增长
    上半年市场供应好于去年价格总水平基本稳定
    本报北京7月15日讯  本报记者何加正、新华社记者蒲立业报道：记者从今天结束的全国副食品生产工作座谈会上获悉：今年上半年，我国副食品生产继续稳步增长，市场供应好于去年，但副食品生产目前也存在着许多不容忽视的制约因素。
    今年以来，党中央、国务院和各级政府、各有关部门非常重视发展副食品生产，制定和实行了一些扶持政策，动员社会各方面力量为丰富“菜篮子”而共同建设好“菜园子”，使全国上半年副食品生产基本保持了稳步增长的势头。
    畜牧业生产总水平提高，草食牲畜增长速度加快。据对全国22个省、市、区的统计，预计到6月底，生猪存栏29773.8万头，比去年同期增长1.4％，其中能繁母猪2186.3万头，比去年同期增长5.2％；猪肉产量857.1万吨，比去年同期增长4.4％。统计资料同时表明，上半年大牲畜存栏9007.6万头，比去年同期增长2.9％；羊存栏12434.2万只，比去年同期增长7.6％；牛、羊肉产量分别比去年同期增长10.2％和11.4％。22个省、市、区的统计资料还表明，上半年禽蛋总产量为300.4万吨，比去年同期增长2.9％；家禽存栏20.08亿只，比去年同期下降4.6％。
    水产业继续保持较好的发展势头。据1—6月份统计，全国水产品产量达422.1万吨，比去年同期增加43.2万吨，增长11.4％。其中海洋捕捞产量217.9万吨，增长14.1％；海水养殖产量32.7万吨，增长8.7％；淡水养殖产量和淡水捕捞产量也分别比去年同期增长8.5％和9.1％。
    蔬菜生产产量增长，品种增加。由于蔬菜种植面积增加、管理加强和气候较好等因素，今年上半年多数大中城市蔬菜单产提高，总产增加。
    从市场供应情况看，上半年各种副食品的上市量增加，品种结构有进一步改善，价格总水平基本稳定，有些产品价格稳中有降，整个销售形势明显好于往年。
