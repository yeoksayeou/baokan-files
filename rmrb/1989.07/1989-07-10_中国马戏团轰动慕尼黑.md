The Chinese Circus has been performing in Munich since May 18th, and approximately 100,000 out of Munich's 1 million residents have attended the performances. The number of tickets sold has surpassed the record set by the world-renowned singer Michael Jackson during his performance in Munich last year. On July 1st, the *Munich Daily* published an article titled "Munich Thanks You, You Are Truly Amazing!" to bid farewell to the Chinese Circus. The article expressed the hope that the Chinese Circus would return to Munich in October to celebrate the traditional Oktoberfest with the people of Munich.
