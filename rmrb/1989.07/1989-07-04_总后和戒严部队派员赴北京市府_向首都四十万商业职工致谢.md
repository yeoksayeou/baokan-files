The General Logistics Department of the People's Liberation Army and the Martial Law Command today sent representatives, including the Director of the Military Supply Department, Wang Juxing, to the Beijing Municipal Government to express their gratitude to the over 400,000 commercial workers in the capital for their strong support and enthusiastic assistance to the troops during the Beijing unrest.

It is understood that on the day martial law was declared in parts of Beijing, the city established a leading group to specifically coordinate the supply work for the troops and clearly put forward the slogan, "To be the good logistics support for the martial law troops." So far, the commercial system in Beijing has provided the troops with hundreds of millions of kilograms of food items such as grain, cooking oil, vegetables, fresh eggs, meat, and sugar. In addition, a batch of daily necessities such as soap and matches have also been provided.

    据新华社北京7月4日电（记者阎振国）中国人民解放军总后勤部和戒严部队指挥部今天上午委派总后军需部部长王聚兴等同志前来北京市政府，感谢首都40多万商业职工在北京发生暴乱期间对部队的大力支持和热情帮助。
    据了解，在宣布北京部分地区实行戒严的当天，北京市便成立了领导小组，专门负责协调对部队的供应工作，并明确提出
  “要当好戒严部队好后勤”的口号。到目前为止，北京市商业系统已为部队提供粮食、食油、蔬菜、鲜蛋、肉类、食糖等食品数百万公斤，另外还提供了一批肥皂、火柴等日用工业品。
