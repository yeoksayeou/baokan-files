Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 11th.

    This year, China's social group purchasing power has continued to be controlled, but it has not yet met the State Council's requirement to reduce it by 20%. According to statistics, from January to May, the actual expenditure of social group purchasing power by county-level and above units was 10.78 billion yuan, an increase of 8.2% compared to the same period last year. After deducting the factor of price increases, it decreased by 14.5%. Only Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Fujian, Hunan, Henan, Gansu, Qinghai, and Guizhou have completed the task of reducing by 20%, while two-thirds of the regions have not completed the task, with five regions showing different degrees of increase.

    In recent years, under the influence of the erroneous idea of high consumption, extravagance and waste have been serious. According to statistics, from 1984 to 1988, 266,500 cars, 58,100 refrigerators, 110,600 color TVs, 95,700 air conditioners, 821,200 sofas, and 1156,800 meters of carpets were purchased, totaling 14.5 billion yuan. From 1984 to 1987, the social group purchasing power of county-level and above units increased by more than 20% annually, far exceeding the industrial growth rate during the same period, and in some years, it also exceeded the growth rate of residents' consumption. The rapid expansion of social group purchasing power has increased market pressure, driven up prices, and fostered a culture of extravagance and corruption.

    Currently, the task of controlling purchases is still arduous and complex. Vice Minister of Finance Chi Hǎibīn today at the National Financial Work Conference pointed out that it is necessary to persist in doing a good job of controlling purchases, taking effective measures, focusing on weak links, and ensuring the completion of the State Council's task of reducing purchases by 20% this year. The main focus is to strengthen the management of non-special controlled commodities and collective enterprises, especially township enterprises and urban street enterprises with more than 200 employees, and to take effective control measures to urge relevant units to timely complete the purchase control targets.

    Chi Hǎibīn said that in the second half of this year, control offices at all levels should conduct an inspection of the implementation of purchase control targets for each unit, the completion of reduction tasks, the approval, sales, and fund allocation of special controlled commodities. For units with violations, confiscate what should be confiscated, fine what should be fined, and deal with responsible personnel seriously. Especially for units that knowingly violate regulations, falsify information, and evade control, they must be dealt with severely. For units that violate regulations to purchase cars and other high-end special controlled commodities, generally do not seal them up, but firmly confiscate them, and allocate them to production and operation units or newly established units in urgent need; and impose severe economic sanctions and disciplinary actions on the violating units.

### 社会集团购买力有所控制  仍未达到压缩百分之二十的要求  财政部负责人要求严肃查处违控行为

    社会集团购买力有所控制
    仍未达到压缩百分之二十的要求
    财政部负责人要求严肃查处违控行为
    本报北京7月11日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：今年以来，我国社会集团购买力继续得到控制，但仍未达到国务院要求压缩20％的指标。据统计，1至5月份，县以上单位社会集团购买力实际支出107.8亿元，比去年同期增长8.2％，按扣除物价上涨因素计算，下降14.5％。完成压缩20％任务的，仅有北京、天津、河北、山西、福建、湖南、河南、甘肃、青海、贵州10个省市，有2／3的地区未完成，其中有5个地区还有不同程度增长。
    近年来，在高消费错误思想影响下，铺张浪费现象严重。据统计，1984年至1988年五年间，就购买小汽车26.65万辆、电冰箱5.81万台，彩电11.06万台、空调9.57万台，沙发82.12万个，地毯115.68万米，仅购以上6种商品，就花掉145亿元。1984至1987年，县以上单位社会集团购买力平均每年以20％以上的速度递增，远远超过同期工业增长速度，有些年份也超过居民消费增长速度。社会集团购买力急剧膨胀，增加了市场压力，推动物价上涨，助长了铺张浪费、奢侈腐败风气的蔓延滋长。
    当前，控购工作仍然十分艰巨、复杂。财政部副部长迟海滨今天在全国财政工作会议上指出，必须坚持不懈地抓好控购工作，采取有效措施，抓住薄弱环节，保证完成国务院提出的今年压缩20％的控购任务。主要是对非专控商品和集体企业，特别是职工在200人以上的乡镇企业、城市街道企业的社会集团购买力加强管理，采取有力的控制措施，督促有关单位及时落实控购指标的完成。
    迟海滨说，今年下半年，各级控办要对各单位控购指标落实情况、压缩任务完成情况、专控商品审批、销售、资金划拨情况进行一次检查，对有违控行为的，该没收的没收，该罚款的罚款，对责任人员该处理的要严肃处理。特别是对明知故犯、弄虚作假、逃避控制的单位，必须从严处理。对违纪购买小汽车等高档专控商品，一般不要封存，而是要坚决没收，作价拨给生产经营单位或急需的新建单位；并对违纪单位给予严厉的经济制裁和纪律处分。
