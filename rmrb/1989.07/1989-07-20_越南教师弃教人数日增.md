The Vietnamese newspaper *People's Army* reported on July 18 that during the 1988-1989 academic year, another 8,000 Vietnamese teachers quit teaching and sought other occupations. This brings the total number of teachers who have changed careers in the past two years to over 20,000.

The report attributes this situation to the difficulties teachers face in their lives.

The *People's Army* said that during the 1988-1989 academic year, the quality of education in Vietnam remained poor. The number of students repeating grades increased significantly compared to the previous year, and the crime rate among students also rose.

The newspaper stated that various levels of party organizations and the government generally do not pay enough attention to education.
