	Random Thoughts on the Earth

	[A Wake-Up Call]
	“Once you enter the temple, not everyone is there to burn incense.” This statement reveals a truth that can be seen everywhere. For example, when hundreds or thousands of people rush into a department store, most are there to buy things; a few are just there to look around and have fun; and an extremely small number are focused solely on picking the pockets of others.

	When the student protests first began, the vast majority of students could never have imagined: just like Pandora opening her box, a small number of people representing evil forces all came out at once. Some supported and incited others to overthrow the government and seize power; some participated to create chaos and take advantage of the situation to make a profit, to make a “war profiteer’s” fortune; and some who had been sentenced to prison but repeatedly refused to reform, running around and shouting, were hiding for many years, filled with hatred towards the Communist Party. This time, seizing the “opportunity,” they came to vent their anger all at once.

	[A Cruel Reality]
	Slogans are something that anyone can use. “Patriotism,” isn’t that right? “Patriotic enthusiasm,” shouldn’t that be affirmed? “Patriotic actions,” could they possibly be wrong? We say that the majority of young students are patriotic because they hope our country will be good. However, there are also people who, under the banner of “patriotism,” are engaged in treacherous activities. Some are not hoping for China to be good but hoping for China to be bad, even wanting to “dissolve” China.

	Therefore, when some people shout the “patriotism” slogan until they are hoarse, but their actions are completely different, clear-minded people should seriously look and see who these people are and what they are doing.

    大地漫笔
    〔一句醒世的哲言〕　“进得庙门来，不都是烧香人。”这话所揭示的事实，随处可见。比方，几百几千人一齐涌进百货大楼，大多数是为了买东西；少数人只是看看、玩玩；而极少数人，则一门心思要掏别人的腰包。
    当学潮初起之时，广大同学怕怎么也没有料想到：如同潘多拉打开了魔盒，极少数代表罪恶的渊薮一齐跑了出来。有人支持怂恿，乃是为了他们推翻政府，篡党夺权；有人参与其间，是想把天下搅乱，趁机捞一把，发“国难财”；有的曾被判刑又屡教不改的人奔走呼啸，则属隐匿了多年，对共产党充满仇恨，这次逮着“良机”，于是来个总发泄……
    〔一种残酷的现实〕　口号这个东西，什么人都可以借用。“爱国”，难道不对吗？“爱国热情”，难道不该肯定吗？“爱国行动”，难道还会有错吗？我们说广大青年学生“爱国”，是因为他们希望我们国家好。然而也有人却在“爱国”的旗帜下，干着卖国的勾当，有人不是希望中国好，而是希望中国坏，甚至要“解散”中国。
    所以，当有的人“爱国”口号喊到声嘶力竭的地步，但行动却压根不是那么回事的时候，清醒的人们就应该认真地看一看，他们到底是些什么人，在干着什么事。
