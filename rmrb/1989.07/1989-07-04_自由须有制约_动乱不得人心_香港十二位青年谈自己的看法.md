We are 12 students from the classes of 1966, 1967, and 1968 in mainland China. During the Cultural Revolution, we were fervently involved, and we also participated in the April 1976 Tiananmen Square demonstrations to protest and denounce the Gang of Four. As a result, we were all detained and persecuted. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, we came to Hong Kong to reunite with our parents and siblings. As "veterans" of the past and "observers" of recent events, we would like to share our views on the current situation in mainland China.

Due to our work, we frequently visit major cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and thus have had the opportunity to interact with many people. Initially, we saw through television and various media in Hong Kong that the student movement in Beijing started with the demand for the government to take measures against corruption, which was a good intention and was initially supported by the government and the people. However, as the situation escalated, it gradually turned into a few individuals with obvious political motives inciting innocent students to oppose the government, attempting to overthrow the government (as seen from the slogans, banners, and speeches on the square, as well as the statements distributed abroad). They compared the people's government to the traitor Chiang Kai-shek and Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines, shouting slogans like "Now is the time to bury the most tyrannical and dark dictatorship." It is clear that this is contrary to the wishes and demands of the vast majority of students, intellectuals, and the billion people. These facts indisputably show that a small number of people are using the student movement to create trouble and expand the turmoil.

In mid-May, we witnessed in Xi'an and Wuhan that the turmoil had spread to schools, transportation, factories, and even foreign trade companies, causing concern among people from all walks of life: Would another Cultural Revolution happen? Soon after, incidents such as blocking traffic on the Yangtze River Bridge and besieging the provincial government occurred, followed by acts of beating, smashing, looting, and arson, seriously threatening the normal work and life of the people, severely damaging social order, and openly challenging the constitution and laws.

To prevent the situation from worsening, to protect the country's modernization drive, and to ensure the normal life, work, and study of the people, the government's necessary actions to quell the turmoil are in accordance with the constitution and the fundamental interests of the state. It can be said that any country facing such a worsening situation would take decisive measures.

A few days ago, an American businessman in Hong Kong mentioned the Beijing student movement turning into a riot: "Every citizen must be aware that they are protected by the law and also constrained by the law. Without constraints, things will turn to the opposite." We asked him: If this happened in the United States, how would it be handled? He frankly said, "I can hardly imagine this happening in the United States. If American students and citizens demonstrated, sat in, fasted, or gave speeches on the White House lawn, the government would intervene early, such as dispersing or arresting them. In the United States, any parade, demonstration, or sit-in requires an application, including the purpose, location, and route, and it is only legal after approval." We then asked him: If there were incidents of beating, smashing, looting, and arson, how would the U.S. government handle it? He said, "This is not peaceful petitioning but destroying society and declaring war on the law. Of course, the government will use necessary means to stop and suppress it, and make arrests and prosecutions." We also asked him: If someone erected a statue of Marx across from the White House, what would happen? He humorously said, "Everyone can erect any idol in their private place, note 'private place,' otherwise public and private will go to court to fight." The American businessman also suggested, "The government should have solved this long ago, and things would have been much better."

We believe that the words of this American businessman can be seen as an objective response to some countries that use "human rights" and "democracy" as excuses to interfere in their internal affairs.

Since the announcement of martial law in parts of Beijing, we have seen on Hong Kong television that a small number of people incited uninformed citizens to block the military from entering the city, seize buses to set up barricades, attack, and slander the People's Liberation Army. Subsequently, a small number of rioters set fire to cars, looted weapons, and beat soldiers to death in their cabins with iron bars and stones, openly reaching a lawless state. Is this for democracy? Is this for defending the constitution? We also saw that in Shanghai, a small number of hooligans and rioters burned an entire train of nine carriages, blocking north-south traffic for several days, and spread rumors that the PLA aimed guns at the driver, causing the death of more than 20 students. Some newspapers in Hong Kong also took advantage of the situation. However, the Shanghai citizens have the most say about the facts. Yesterday, two people who returned from Shanghai told us the truth: these were all rumors.

We have seen that in Hong Kong, some "savior" used the excuse of quelling the riot to openly propose abolishing the Sino-British Joint Declaration, seeking de facto independence, inciting a "three-strike" movement, and even providing weapons to a small number of people on the mainland to overthrow the government. We can predict that if Hong Kong has turmoil in the future, these people will be one of the factors causing the turmoil.

In recent times, some newspapers in Hong Kong have fabricated rumors to an incredible extent. Even some newspaper and monthly magazine editors have told us, "Some news is copied from here and there, we ourselves do not believe it, and we do not know the source, so we use phrases like 'according to reports' and 'according to Beijing news,'" and the strangeness can be imagined. One newspaper editor said, "During the clearing of Tiananmen Square, what exactly happened? Currently, it is all hearsay. Some say they were the last batch to leave and saw the PLA charging with tanks and mowing down with machine guns, which is definitely fabricated. Would he be faster than the speed of a tank or the acceleration of machine gun fire? Even stranger is that until now, there is not a single photo to prove that the PLA opened fire on students during the retreat from Tiananmen Square. We believe that the PLA and the people on the scene have the most right to speak the truth." We fully agree with Deng Xiaoping's speech: Summarize the past and create the future.

The achievements of the past decade of reform in mainland China are indisputable. Despite some people not wanting to see or fearing to see, the biggest mistake of the past decade of reform is education. It can be said that first, the consciousness of serving the people among party members and cadres is too weak, or it can be said that their quality is too low. We hope that in summarizing past events, we will add a lesson on the causes and disasters of the Cultural Revolution for young students, a lesson on modern history of how the Chinese people stood up, a lesson on loving the People's Republic of China for the whole nation, and a lesson on understanding the constitution and laws, the relationship between protection and constraint.

We suggest that democratic and legal construction must be strengthened, and corruption, embezzlement, and other phenomena must be severely punished, and the pace of reform must be accelerated.

We believe that the motherland has great hope.

    自由须有制约  动乱不得人心
    ——香港十二位青年谈自己的看法
    我们是12名内地1966、67、68届学生，当年曾狂热投入“文革”，也曾参加了1976年4月天安门的示威活动，抗议、声讨“四人帮”，因而都受到关押、迫害，在70年代后及80年代初到香港和父母、兄弟团聚。作为前一段历史的“过来人”，也作为最近一段历史的“旁观者”，我们谈谈自己对内地当前局势的看法。
    因工作关系常到北京、上海、广州等大城市，因而接触不少人士，前一段在港通过电视及中外报章、杂志等传媒界，看到北京学运开始要求政府采取措施反对官倒，清除腐败的良好愿望，并得到政府和人民的首肯。但随着事态的发展和升级，逐渐演变成极少数人显然有政治目的地唆使纯情学生反对政府，妄图推翻政府（从口号、标语、横幅及广场演说和向外散发的声明看），把人民政府比作当年的卖国贼蒋介石、菲律宾的马科斯，叫嚷：现在是埋葬最专制黑暗独裁时刻等。显而易见，这和广大学生、知识分子及亿万人民本身愿望和要求是背道而驰的。这些事实不可否认地说明，确有一小撮人利用学运制造事端，扩大动乱。
    5月中旬，我们在西安、武汉等地已见到动乱波及和影响到学校、交通、工厂，甚至外贸公司，并引起各界人民的担忧：是否又要来次“文革”？不久，又发生阻拦长江大桥交通、包围省政府等事件，继而又发生了打、砸、抢、烧等现象，严重威胁人民正常的工作、生活，严重损害了社会治安，明目张胆地向宪法和法律挑战。
    为了制止事态进一步恶化，保卫国家四化建设，保障人民的正常生活、工作、学习，政府采取必要行动平息暴乱是符合宪法，符合国家根本利益的。可以讲，任何国家遇到蔓延开来的这类恶化情况，都会采取有力措施的。
    前些天，在港的一位美国大商家在谈到北京学运演变为暴乱时说：“每个公民必须意识到既受法律保护又受法律制约，离开了制约会走向反面。”
    我们问他：如果此事发生在美国会怎么处理？他坦率讲：“我很难想像会发生在美国，如果美国学生、市民在白宫草坪上示威、静坐、绝食、演说，政府早就会干预，例如驱散、拘捕等。在美国任何游行、示威、静坐都要提出申请，包括目的、地点、路线等，待批准方为合法。”我们又问他：如果出现打、砸、抢、烧情况，美国政府会如何呢？他说：“这就不是什么和平请愿，而是破坏社会向法律宣战，当然政府会运用必要手段来阻止、平息，予以拘捕、起诉。”我们还问他：如果有人在白宫对面矗立一座马克思塑像又会怎么样处理？他风趣地说：“每个人可以随意在自己私人地方矗立任何人偶像，请注意‘私人地方’，否则公和私会上法庭打架。”那位美国商人也提出：“政府早就应解决，那样就会好多了。”
    我们认为，这位美国商人的话可以说是对某些惯以“人权、民主”为借口干预他国内政的国家政府的一个客观的回答。
    从北京宣布部分地区实施戒严以来，我们从香港电视上看到一小撮人煽动不明真相民众阻挡军队进城，抢夺巴士作路障，围攻、诬蔑人民军队。继而一小撮暴徒放火烧车，抢夺武器，用铁棒、石块把解放军活活砸死在驾驶室等，公然发展到无法无天的地步。难道这是为了民主，为了捍卫宪法？我们也看到了上海一小撮流氓、暴徒竟烧毁整列九个车厢，阻塞南北交通数天，并造谣说是解放军用枪指着司机开车撞死20多名学生。在港某些报刊也借题发挥。但是，对事实真相最有发言权的是上海市民。昨日有两位在沪办厂人返港告知了究竟是怎么回事，原来，这些都是谣言。
    我们看到，香港也有个别“救世主”借口平息暴乱事件，公然提出废除中英联合声明，搞变相独立，煽动“三罢”，甚至于提出供武器给大陆一小撮人来推翻政府。可以预言，今后香港如有动荡，这个别人是制造动荡因素之一。
    近期，香港某些报刊编造谣言已到了神乎其神的境地，连一些报刊及月刊杂志编辑也对我们说：“一些消息东抄西传，我们自己也不相信，也不明消息来源只好用‘据传’、‘据北京消息’等词句”，其离奇可一想而知。有一位报社编辑就说：“天安门广场清场时候，究竟什么样，目前都是听说的，有人说自己是最后一批离开，又看见解放军用坦克对人群冲，用机枪扫，肯定是编造的，难道他比坦克车速、机枪发射的加速度要快？更奇怪的是至今未有一张照片可证实天安门学生撤退时军队开枪情况。我们相信当时清场解放军和在场人最有资格说明真相”。我们完全赞同邓小平的讲话：总结过去，开创未来。
    内地十年来的改革成果是任何人无法抹煞的。尽管有人不愿看到或怕看到，10年来的改革最大失误是教育，可以这样讲，首先党员干部的为人民服务的意识教育太差，也可以说素质太差。我们希望在总结过往事件要在青年学生中补上“文革”起因及造成灾害一课，补上中国人民是如何站起来的现代史一课。在全民中补上热爱中华人民共和国一课，要补上懂得宪法、法律，保护和制约的关系一课。
    我们建议，必须大力加强民主和法制建设，严厉惩治“官倒”、贪污、腐败等现象，加快改革前进的步伐。
    我们相信，祖国是大有希望的。
    陈真、雷鸣、惠民、龙昌、伟杰等12人于香港
