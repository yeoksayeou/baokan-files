The Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland have all stipulated in their constitutions the principle of guaranteeing citizens' rights to assemble, parade, and demonstrate. They have also enacted specific laws to regulate the exercise of these rights.

I. Constitutional and Legal Principles on Freedom of Assembly, Parade, and Demonstration

The constitutions of the three countries all state that the state guarantees citizens' freedom to assemble, parade, and demonstrate. However, specific laws also impose restrictions on the exercise of this freedom.

The Soviet Constitution states: "To serve the interests of the people and to strengthen and develop the socialist system, the Soviet Union guarantees its citizens freedom of speech, press, assembly, parade, and demonstration." It also states: "Citizens exercising their rights and freedoms must not harm the interests of society and the state, nor the rights of other citizens."

The Hungarian Constitution states: "The Hungarian People's Republic, based on socialist principles and the interests of the people, guarantees freedom of speech, press, and assembly." The Assembly Law further stipulates that the exercise of assembly rights must not lead to or incite criminal activities, nor harm the rights and freedoms of others.

The Polish Constitution states: "The Polish People's Republic guarantees citizens freedom of speech, press, assembly, parade, and demonstration." The Assembly Law further stipulates that assemblies must not violate the Assembly Law or criminal law, nor harm social interests or threaten safety and public order.

II. Administrative Management of Applications for Assemblies, Parades, and Demonstrations

1. Reporting System

The Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland all require citizens to report in advance before holding assemblies, parades, and demonstrations. The differences are: the Soviet Union requires approval before holding such events; Hungary only requires reporting without the need for approval; Poland requires approval for some assemblies and not for others.

2. Qualifications of Applicants (Organizers)

The Soviet Union stipulates that individuals who are 18 years old or older, and are authorized by enterprises, institutions, cooperatives, and other social organizations, social self-governing bodies, and citizen groups, can apply to hold assemblies, parades, and demonstrations.

3. Written Application Items

The Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland all require that the written application include: the purpose of the assembly, parade, or demonstration; the schedule (time, place, route); the number of participants; and the names and addresses of the organizers.

4. Approval Conditions

The Soviet Union and Poland prohibit all illegal assemblies, parades, and demonstrations. They also stipulate that the competent authorities have the right to change the time, place, and methods of the activities.

Hungary, although it does not require approval for assemblies, stipulates that if the competent authorities deem that the assembly activities will seriously harm the normal operations of the people's representative bodies or courts, or seriously disrupt traffic order, they have the right to decide within 48 hours of receiving the report to prohibit the assembly activities.

III. Protective Measures for Assemblies, Parades, and Demonstrations

1. Individuals can appeal the competent authorities' decision to prohibit assemblies, parades, and demonstrations.

2. Protect all legal assemblies, parades, and demonstrations.

The Soviet Union stipulates that state organs, social organizations, public servants, and other citizens have no right to obstruct assemblies, parades, and demonstrations held in accordance with the prescribed procedures.

IV. Management Measures for Assemblies, Parades, and Demonstrations

1. Assemblies, parades, and demonstrations must be conducted in accordance with the reported or approved conditions.

The Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland all stipulate that assemblies, parades, and demonstrations must adhere to the purpose, time, place, and peaceful conduct as stated in the application. It is prohibited to carry weapons or other tools that endanger human life.

2. Ensure order during the activities, and stop any illegal acts.

The Soviet Union, Hungary, and Poland all stipulate that the organizers and participants of the activities must comply with the law and public order.

The Soviet Union stipulates that if assemblies, parades, and demonstrations have any of the following circumstances, the representatives of the power organs have the right to request the competent authorities to disband them, and the relevant personnel shall be held legally responsible: (1) without application; (2) application not approved; (3) not conducted in accordance with the approved conditions (purpose, time, place, etc.); (4) threatening the life and health of citizens; (5) disrupting public order.

Hungary stipulates that if assembly, parade, and demonstration activities lead to or incite criminal activities, harm the rights and freedoms of others, participants carry weapons to the scene, disrupt the order of the activities, or hold activities in defiance of prohibitions, the police have the right to disperse them, but must issue a warning first.

Poland stipulates that the chairman of the assembly has the right to expel from the venue those who obstruct the assembly or attempt to disrupt it. When participants do not heed the chairman's decisions made in the performance of their duties or the assembly's proceedings violate criminal law, the chairman should disband the assembly.

3. Designate areas where assemblies, parades, and demonstrations are prohibited. Hungary stipulates that areas near the Parliament building are prohibited zones for organizing and holding assembly activities.
