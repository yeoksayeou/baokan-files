The national propaganda department heads meeting, which concluded today, emphasized that the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the recent important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping are the guiding principles for the entire propaganda and ideological work. Leaders and cadres at all levels in the propaganda and ideological fields, as well as the broad masses of cadres, must recognize the situation, boost their spirits, and continue to earnestly propagate the basic line of "one center, two basic points" established by the Thirteenth Party Congress. They must conduct in-depth education to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, contributing to the stabilization of the situation, economic development, deepening of reforms, and the fight against corruption. They must also contribute to strengthening party building, spiritual civilization construction, and democratic and legal construction.

The meeting, convened by the Central Propaganda Department, was held in Beijing from July 17 to 21. Propaganda department heads from various provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, as well as leaders from major news, cultural, and publishing units in the capital, attended the meeting. Delegates at the meeting agreed that holding this propaganda department heads meeting right after the historic Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee is very timely. At this critical moment when the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot have been decisively stopped and suppressed, propaganda departments at all levels need to calmly reflect on the past and future, clarify the guiding principles and tasks for propaganda and ideological work, and, in accordance with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, strengthen propaganda and ideological work.

Wang Renshou, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, spoke at the meeting. He said that the two-month-long turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot were shocking and horrifying. Through this incident, we have clearly recognized that bourgeois liberalization is a very dangerous social and political trend that disrupts political stability and undermines our socialist republic. The leadership of the propaganda and public opinion front must be in the hands of Marxists and comrades who implement the party's line. Currently, the fundamental task in the field of propaganda and ideology is to, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, carry out this struggle in the ideological field to the end, eliminate the roots of turmoil in the ideological field, and ensure the genuine implementation of the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

The meeting believed that currently, it is necessary to continue to do a good job in propaganda and education to stop the turmoil, suppress the riot, and stabilize the situation. It is necessary to address the ideological recognition issues of different aspects and levels of the masses, present facts, reason, and use various vivid materials and forms that are easy for the masses to accept to explain that this is a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil. It is necessary to explain that this is the result of the intensification of ideological and political infiltration by anti-communist and anti-socialist forces abroad and the rampant bourgeois liberalization trend at home. It is necessary to make the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the people fully recognize the seriousness of this political struggle concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, recognize the necessity of firmly adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, and recognize the long-term and arduous nature of opposing bourgeois liberalization. Propaganda to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation should be clear-cut and policy-oriented, strictly distinguishing between two different types of contradictions.

The meeting emphasized the need to deeply propagate the correctness of the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, so that people understand that our reform and opening up is a reform and opening up that adheres to the Four Cardinal Principles, and that reform and opening up endows the Four Cardinal Principles with new content. It is absolutely not possible to separate reform and opening up from the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose them.

Delegates at the meeting, based on a serious summary of experiences and lessons, unanimously agreed that it is necessary to strengthen and improve ideological and political work and stabilize and strengthen the political work team. It is necessary to carry out education on patriotism, socialism, independence, self-reliance, hard work, and law-abiding in the broad masses of cadres and the people, oppose extreme individualism, money worship, anarchism, worship of foreign things, and various decadent and corrupt bad tendencies, and truly strengthen socialist spiritual civilization construction. The most important thing in doing ideological and political work is to strengthen the party's ideological construction. It is necessary to propagate the experiences of various levels of party organizations in strengthening party building and the advanced deeds of outstanding Communist Party members on various fronts to enhance the combat effectiveness and cohesion of party organizations.

The meeting proposed to strengthen propaganda on construction, reform, and the fight against corruption. Propaganda departments should timely strengthen the regular propaganda and reporting of various items centered on economic construction. It is necessary to better promote reform and opening up, continue to rectify and regulate, control prices, stabilize and develop the economy. It is necessary to actively and effectively do public opinion support work for the Party and government's established policies and major actions in fighting corruption, so that the people understand the Party's firm stance on fighting corruption and the serious attitude towards correcting mistakes.

The meeting believed that in the future, it is necessary to strengthen theoretical research, propaganda, and education work. To fundamentally solve the problem of bourgeois liberalization, it is necessary to work hard on theoretical research, propaganda, and criticism. It is necessary to seriously sort out and study various erroneous views reflected in the rampant bourgeois liberalization in recent years, and write substantial articles in response to the confused theoretical right and wrong. It is necessary to deeply analyze and refute the various fallacies of beautifying capitalism, denying socialism, opposing party leadership, abolishing people's democratic dictatorship, and defaming Marxism. Theoretical work should adhere to Marxism as a guide, be based on China's reality, and deeply study new problems in reform and opening up and modernization construction. It is necessary to continue to implement the policy of letting a hundred schools of thought contend, encourage emancipation of the mind, bold exploration, propose various views and strategies, allow exploration mistakes and retain different opinions. It is advocated to respect facts, adhere to truth, and promote a style of comradely discussion and debate. On the basis of adhering to the party's basic line, it is necessary to enhance the unity of the theoretical team.

The meeting decided to resolutely and properly rectify the propaganda and public opinion front. News and publishing units, social science research institutions, and literary and artistic groups should, in combination with actual conditions, conduct a thorough and earnest education to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization. Through patient and meticulous work, it is necessary to improve the political and ideological awareness of cadres, rectify bad tendencies, and truly strengthen the construction of news, theoretical, and literary teams. Propaganda departments should, in conjunction with news and publishing management departments, seriously rectify the cultural market, ban reactionary, pornographic publications and audio-visual products, and manage publishing houses and printing plants well.

The meeting also emphasized the need to strengthen external propaganda and safeguard the dignity of socialist China. It is necessary to vigorously propagate that our basic line and basic domestic and foreign policies remain unchanged. It is necessary to propagate from various aspects the policy measures, actual progress, and typical examples of opening up to the outside world, indicating that China sincerely and consistently welcomes equal and mutually beneficial extensive cooperation with all countries.

The meeting emphasized that Party committees at all levels must strengthen their leadership over propaganda and ideological work. Party committees must overcome the phenomenon of being strong in one hand and weak in the other. Party committee secretaries must personally take charge and frequently oversee the work.

Wang Weicheng, Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, summarized the meeting by saying that the Central Committee attaches great importance to this meeting, and the overall spirit is that the whole Party should attach importance to and support propaganda work, truly allowing socialist ideology to occupy the field. We must seriously, comprehensively, and resolutely implement the spirit of this meeting. Comrades in the propaganda front must clarify the direction, work hard, and quickly bring about a new look in propaganda work.

    新华社北京7月21日电　（记者孙本尧）今天闭幕的全国宣传部长会议强调指出，党的十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志最近几次重要讲话，是整个宣传、思想工作的指导方针。宣传、思想战线的各级领导和广大干部要认清形势，振奋精神，继续认真宣传党的十三大确定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，深入进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，为稳定局势、发展经济、深化改革、反对腐败，为加强党的建设、精神文明建设和民主、法制建设作出新的贡献。
    由中宣部召开的这次全国宣传部长会议7月17日至21日在北京举行。各省、自治区、直辖市党委宣传部长和首都主要新闻、文化、出版单位的负责人出席了会议。与会同志认为，在具有历史意义的党的十三届四中全会之后召开这次宣传部长会议，是非常及时的。在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利的时刻，各级宣传部门需要冷静地思考过去和未来，明确今后宣传、思想工作的方针和任务，按照四中全会精神，大力加强宣传、思想工作。
    中宣部部长王忍之在会上讲了话。他说，历时两个月的动乱和反革命暴乱，惊心动魄，骇人听闻。通过这次事件，我们清楚地认识到，资产阶级自由化是破坏安定团结的政治局面，颠覆我们社会主义人民共和国的十分危险的社会政治思潮。宣传舆论阵地的领导权要掌握在马克思主义者手中，要掌握在执行党的路线的同志手中。当前，宣传、意识形态领域工作的根本任务，就是要在党中央的领导下，在意识形态领域中把这场斗争进行到底，在意识形态领域中消除再一次产生动乱的根源，保证真正贯彻执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线。
    会议认为，当前，要继续做好制止动乱、平息暴乱、稳定局势的宣传教育工作。要针对不同方面、不同层次群众的思想认识问题，摆事实，讲道理，运用各种生动的材料和易于为群众接受的形式，说明这是一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，说明这是国际上反共反社会主义势力加紧进行思想、政治渗透和国内资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的恶果。要使广大党员、干部和群众充分认识这场关系党和国家生死存亡的政治斗争的严重性，认识坚定不移地坚持四项基本原则和改革开放的必要性，认识反对资产阶级自由化的长期性、艰巨性。制止动乱、稳定局势的宣传，既要旗帜鲜明，又要讲究政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。
    会议强调，要深入宣传党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策的正确性，使人们了解我们的改革开放是坚持四项基本原则的改革开放，而改革开放又赋予四项基本原则以新的内容，绝不能把改革开放与四项基本原则割裂开来，对立起来。
    与会同志在认真总结经验教训的基础上，一致认为，必须认真加强和改进思想政治工作，稳定、充实政工队伍。要在广大干部群众中，努力开展爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗和遵纪守法的教育，反对极端个人主义、拜金主义、无政府主义、崇洋媚外的思想和各种腐朽、堕落的不良风气，切实加强社会主义精神文明建设。做好思想政治工作，最重要的是加强党的思想建设。要宣传各级党组织抓好党的建设的经验和各条战线上优秀共产党员的先进事迹，以增强党组织的战斗力和凝聚力。
    会议提出，要加强建设、改革和惩治腐败的宣传。各宣传舆论部门要及时加强以经济建设为中心的各项经常性的宣传报道。要更好地推动改革开放，继续进行治理整顿，控制物价，稳定和发展经济。对党和政府在惩治腐败方面既定的政策和采取的重大行动，要积极、有效地做好舆论配合工作，使人民了解我们党反对腐败的坚定方针和纠正失误的严肃态度。
    会议认为，今后应该加强理论研究、理论宣传、理论教育工作。要从深层解决资产阶级自由化的问题，必须在理论研究、理论宣传、理论批判上下功夫。要认真清理、研究几年来资产阶级自由化泛滥中反映出来的各种错误观点，针对被搞乱的理论是非，写出有份量的文章。对美化资本主义、否定社会主义、反对党的领导、取消人民民主专政、诋毁马克思主义的种种谬论，要深入剖析，给予有力批驳。理论工作要坚持以马克思主义为指导，立足中国现实，深入研究改革开放和现代化建设中的新问题。要继续贯彻百家争鸣的方针，鼓励解放思想，大胆探索，提出各种见解和对策，允许探索失误和保留不同意见。提倡尊重事实、服从真理，进行同志式讨论和争论的风气。在坚持党的基本路线的基础上，增进理论队伍的团结。
    会议确定，要坚决、妥善地整顿宣传舆论阵地。新闻出版单位、社会科学研究机构、文艺学术团体要结合实际，普遍、认真地进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，通过耐心、细致的工作，提高干部的政治思想觉悟，纠正不良风气，切实加强新闻、理论、文艺队伍的建设。宣传部门要会同新闻出版管理部门，认真整顿文化市场，取缔反动的、黄色的出版物和音像制品，管好出版社和印刷厂。
    会议还强调指出，要加强对外宣传，维护社会主义中国的尊严。要大力宣传我们的基本路线和基本的对内对外政策不变。要从多方面宣传对外开放的政策措施、实际进展和典型事例，表明中国诚心诚意、始终如一地欢迎与各国进行平等互利的广泛合作。
    会议强调，各级党委要切实加强对宣传、思想工作的领导。党委一定要克服一手硬、一手软的现象。党委书记要亲自抓，经常抓。
    中宣部常务副部长王维澄在会议小结时说，中央对这次会议很重视，总的精神是全党都要重视和支持宣传工作，真正让社会主义思想占领阵地。我们要认真、全面、坚决地贯彻这次会议精神。宣传战线的同志要明确方向，努力工作，尽快使宣传工作出现新的面貌。
