The "God of Wealth" Who Hates Incense
— A Record of the Party Members and Cadres of the Agricultural Bank of Jimo County Refusing Gifts and Bribes

In recent years, the development of the commodity economy in the rural areas of Jimo County, Shandong Province, on the Jiaodong Peninsula, has been rapid, and the Agricultural Bank has played a significant role. Many enterprises and individual farmers have turned to the Agricultural Bank for support in times of financial need and have received enthusiastic assistance. However, these "Gods of Wealth" hate incense and will not lend money even if you offer them bribes for loans that should not be granted, and they will not accept gifts for loans that should be granted.

In recent years, the entire system has refused to accept gifts and bribes more than 1000 times, totaling approximately 100,000 yuan. The bank has been rated as a provincial civilized unit for three consecutive years and has been awarded the title of "Advanced Unit for Enterprise Rectification" by the Agricultural Bank of China.

The following are the stories of a few party members.

A Box of Prawns

One evening, a representative from a county-run enterprise drove to the home of the heads of the Jimo County Agricultural Bank, Han Tianliang and Wang Jianshu, and delivered a box of prawns worth 1000 yuan, saying they were for them to enjoy. Upon hearing this, the two immediately became serious and criticized the person who brought the gift on the spot, ordering them to take the items back. The two gift-bearers, seeing that things were not going well, feared they would not be able to complete the special task given to them by their leader and would not be able to report back, exchanged a glance and fled. By the time Han Tianliang and Wang Jianshu chased them out the door, they had already jumped into the car and left.

"What should we do?" The two leaders discussed it: Uprightness and integrity must start from the leaders. The next day, as soon as they started work, they sent someone to return the prawns unopened.

One Thousand Yuan

Huang Shuyan, the former office director (now the chairman of the union) of the county Agricultural Bank, was in charge of the bank's construction work. One afternoon, an unexpected visitor came to his home. The man introduced himself to Huang's wife as a representative from a construction company. When the visitor saw that there was no one else in the house, he mysteriously took out 1000 yuan from his bag and placed it on the table, saying, "Director Huang introduced us to a subcontracting project, and we have made a lot of money. Today, we specially came to express our gratitude." Then he said he had to catch a train and hurriedly left. By the time Huang's wife chased him out the door, the visitor had disappeared. When Huang returned home from work and heard about the incident, he criticized his wife for keeping the money. The next day, Huang went to the construction company and found the person who had delivered the money, returning it to him in full.

A Color Television

An individual entrepreneur from Wangcun Town, with the support of loans from the Agricultural Bank branch, has seen his business thrive in recent years, earning tens of thousands of yuan annually. To express his gratitude, the entrepreneur brought gifts to the branch manager, Han Zhengda, several times, all of which were refused. Once, he heard that Han was going to buy a color television and quickly bought one and sent it over. Han repeatedly asked him for the delivery note, but he always said, "We'll settle the account later."

"If you don't hand over the delivery note, please take the television back!" Han said angrily.

Seeing that Han had changed his expression, the entrepreneur had no choice but to hand over the delivery note. A few days later, Han returned the money to the entrepreneur who had bought the television according to the amount on the delivery note.

A Box of "Cigarettes"

One day, a shrimp farmer sent his child to deliver a box of high-grade cigarettes to the manager of the Fengcheng Branch, Zhang Zuofang. Old Zhang opened it to find 400 yuan in cash inside. He thought, "I am a Communist Party member, and supporting the people in getting rich is my duty. I cannot accept even a single cent of the gift." He immediately returned the money and explained the reason to the person who had delivered it, deeply moving the farmer.

    厌恶敬香的“财神”
    ——记即墨县农行党员干部拒礼拒贿
    胶东半岛上的山东省即墨县这几年农村商品经济发展迅速，是农行立了大功。许多企业和农民个体户在资金紧缺的紧要关头找到农行的同志，都能得到热情的支持。然而，这些“财神”厌恶“敬香”，不该贷的你给好处也不贷，该贷的你给谢礼也不要。
    近几年来，全系统拒收谢礼和贿赂达1000多次，折合人民币约10万元。该行连续三年被评为省级文明单位，并被中国农业银行授予“企业整顿先进单位”。
    这里记叙的是几位党员的事迹。一箱对虾
    一天晚上，某县办企业派人开车给县农行负责人韩天良、王建淑送来了一箱价值千元的对虾，说是让他俩尝尝鲜。他们一听，顿时严肃起来，当场对送礼的人进行了批评，并让他们把东西带回去。两个送礼人一看不好，怕完不成领导交给的特殊任务，回去不好交差，相互递了个眼色，便拔腿就跑。待韩天良和王建淑追出门去，他们已跳上汽车走了。
    “怎么办？”两个负责人商量了一下：清正廉洁必须从领导做起。第二天一上班，他们便派人把对虾原封不动地退了回去。一千元钱
    县农行原办公室主任（现为工会主席）黄树衍，分管全行的基建工作。有一天下午，他家里来了一位不速之客。那人一进门，便向老黄的爱人作了自我介绍，声称是某建筑公司的，当来人发现屋里没有其他人时，便从提包里神秘地掏出1000元钱，放在桌子上，说“黄主任给我们介绍了一项承包工程，我们收入不少，今日特来表示一点谢意。”尔后说要急着赶车，便急匆匆地走了。待老黄爱人追出门去，来人已不见踪影。老黄下班回家听说这件事，批评爱人不该留下钱，第二天，老黄来到了建筑公司，找到了送款人，当面把钱如数退回。一台彩电
    王村镇一个体户，近几年在农行办事处的贷款扶持下，生意越做越红火，年收入数万元。为表示谢意，这个个体户几次带着礼品到农行办事处主任韩正达家，都被一一拒绝。有一次，他听说老韩要买彩电，很快便买了一台送了去。老韩多次向他要发货票，他总是说，帐以后再算。
    “如你再不交出发货票，请把彩电搬走！”老韩发火道。
    个体户一看老韩变了脸，只好交出了发货票。几天后，老韩按照彩电发货票上的金额把钱还给了买彩电的个体户。一盒“香烟”
    一天，有一个养虾专业户打发孩子给丰城营业所主任张作芳送来一盒高级香烟，老张打开一看，里面装着400元现金。他想，我是一名共产党员，支持群众致富是自己应尽的责任，“谢礼”一文也不能收。于是，他马上把钱退了回去，并向送款人讲明了道理，使这个专业户很受感动。
