The New China News Agency, Beijing, July 27th: The Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping, today signed an order to confer the honorary title of "Guardians of the Republic" on Zhao Youming and four other comrades.

He participated in the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam and was awarded a combat merit. During the enforcement of martial law in the capital and the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, he repeatedly risked his life to gather intelligence and coordinate with the public security department to apprehend rioters. On June 4, 1989, he led a reconnaissance team to raid the "High Autonomy Federation" command center set up under the Monument to the People's Heroes in Tiananmen Square. He commanded decisively and fought bravely, always leading the charge. In just half an hour, he completely destroyed the "High Autonomy Federation" command center, seizing a large amount of communication and propaganda equipment and reactionary propaganda materials, creating conditions for the smooth clearing of Tiananmen Square.

Along the way, the antenna on the armored vehicle was damaged by rioters, losing contact with the following vehicles. He quickly decided to command the vehicles to proceed according to the predetermined plan. To reach the command position on time, he disregarded his personal safety, always standing outside the vehicle, directing the vehicles amidst the rioters' attacks with bricks, stones, and Molotov cocktails. He suffered over ten injuries to his head and his face was burned by sulfuric acid, but with unyielding will, he continued to lead the eight comrades on the vehicle, overcoming numerous difficulties and advancing bravely.

Upon arrival, he actively cleared over forty roadblocks around the square and pushed away over twenty vehicles of various sizes blocking the road, creating conditions for the smooth advance of the main force's armored vehicles.

Wang Qiang: Political protection officer of the political department of an artillery regiment of the capital's martial law troops, from Feidong County, Anhui Province, Han ethnicity, born in November 1965, enlisted in November 1983, joined the party in June 1985, rank of Lieutenant.

At the critical moment, he set an example, fighting bravely. On June 3, 1989, the unit was ordered to advance towards Tiananmen Square. Along the way, they were repeatedly attacked by rioters. Despite being injured multiple times, with eleven bullet wounds to his abdomen and legs, he endured the pain, protecting the safety of the regiment's command post and ensuring the smooth advance of the following vehicles and military command post. When the unit reached the designated location, he collapsed in the vehicle due to excessive blood loss.

Over the past seven years, he has safely driven 50,000 kilometers, been awarded a third-class merit, received six commendations, and been rated as a Red Flag driver every year.

Along the way, he was injured multiple times by rioters but still braved the danger to protect the advancing troops. When they reached the overpass at Caishikou, he saved a comrade, suffering a penetrating injury to his right eye, with the lens dislodged. In this situation, he used astonishing willpower, covering his eye with his hand while letting the injured comrade hold onto his ammunition pouch, dragging the injured towards Tiananmen Square. At dawn on June 4, he led the entire platoon and nine injured comrades, breaking through layer upon layer of obstacles, reaching the designated location, and successfully completing the advance mission.

The order of the Central Military Commission states that Comrades Shen Yuntian and Yu Aijun are outstanding examples that emerged in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital. They are outstanding party members and loyal soldiers of the people. All comrades in the army should learn from their example, seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, and steadfastly maintain unity with the Party Central Committee. They should further carry forward the fine traditions of the people's army, strengthen the overall construction of the troops, and complete various tasks, striving to advance the reform and construction of our country.

The New China News Agency, Beijing, July 27th: The Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping, today signed an order to confer the honorary title of "Guardians of the Republic" on Comrades Zhou Jiazu and You Dehao.

Zhou Jiazu: Battalion commander of the second battalion of a unit of the capital's martial law troops, from Honghu, Hubei Province, Han ethnicity, born in July 1954, enlisted in December 1974, joined the party in March 1977, rank of Major. Since enlisting, he has been awarded the third-class merit twice and commended over ten times. This "July 1st," he was commended by the General Political Department as an outstanding party worker. On June 3, 1989, during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, he voluntarily requested to lead the third echelon vanguard battalion of his unit. He led the entire battalion of officers and soldiers to advance bravely and quickly, marching on foot for nine hours, breaking through eight roadblocks, two firewalls, and the heavy encirclement of the masses who did not understand the truth. Due to strict organization and command, although the entire battalion had injuries, no one fell behind or lost any weapons. They reached Tiananmen Square at dawn on June 4, completing the task of opening the way for the following units and participating in the clearing of Tiananmen Square. Afterwards, he led the entire battalion to assist the local police station in apprehending rioters and seizing a batch of weapons and ammunition.

He always prioritizes the interests of the Party and the state. In the face of his mother's cancer and his wife's hospitalization, he resolutely requested to go to Beijing to execute martial law. On June 3, 1989, during the advance towards Tiananmen Square, he was repeatedly attacked by rioters. When riding in the vehicle, he let the soldiers move inside while he stood at the tail, using his body to block the bricks and bottles thrown by the rioters, protecting the soldiers' safety. When marching on foot, he saw that the soldiers at the rear were at greater risk and more likely to be injured, so he voluntarily requested to take on the rear guard duty. A soldier carrying a 10-kilogram bag of biscuits was tired, so he took the bag and carried it on his shoulder. Despite being injured three times, he braved the danger to rescue two injured new soldiers who had fallen behind from the rioters. To protect his comrades, his head and face were each hit by a three to four centimeter long gash, and two front teeth were knocked out. When he saw a soldier trying to come back to save him, he loudly ordered the soldier, "Don't worry about me, catch up with the unit!" He was then beaten unconscious by the rioters, and the heartless rioters stripped off his clothes and continued to beat him with sticks and stones, causing severe injuries. He was in a coma for seven days and seven nights in the hospital. Under his spiritual encouragement, all soldiers in the platoon fought together, without losing any weapons, equipment, or supplies, and reached the assembly point on time.

The order of the Central Military Commission states that Comrades Zhou Jiazu and You Dehao, in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, stood firm, held high the banner, braved dangers, and were not afraid of sacrificing their lives. They fully demonstrated a Communist Party member's unlimited loyalty to the Party, the country, and socialism, showcasing the new appearance of revolutionary soldiers. They are worthy of being models for all comrades in the army. The order calls on all comrades in the army to learn from their example, seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, and steadfastly maintain unity with the Party Central Committee. They should further carry forward the fine traditions of the people's army, strengthen the overall construction of the troops, and complete various tasks, striving to advance the reform and construction of our country.
