Currently, criminals' methods of committing crimes are more concealed and cunning than ever before. However, "the higher the eaves, the higher the roof." If a criminal encounters Ding Jia Nian, the chief of the Maojian Xiadiba Police Station in Jiangsu Province's Taixing County, even the most cunning "fox" might find it difficult to escape the grasp of this skilled "hunter."

One evening, Ding Jia Nian was conducting a routine inspection at the Jinming Hotel and discovered that a traveler named Su from Lingbao, Henan, had checked in. While chatting, Ding noticed that Su's identity did not match the information on his introduction letter. Ding knew that Lingbao is famous for its gold mines, and with the sensitivity of a public security officer, he became suspicious of the traveler. Later, under questioning, Su could not hold out and finally revealed the truth. Ding immediately found 515 grams of gold on Su and another accomplice, recovering economic losses of over 20,000 yuan for the state.

Last June, a theft occurred at the Huangcun warehouse of the Taixing County Water Conservancy Bureau. Upon receiving the report, Ding Jia Nian and several colleagues rushed to the scene. After analyzing the available clues, he suspected Zhang from Zhongsha Village, Qiaotou Township, had significant involvement. The investigation team adopted his suggestion and immediately headed to Zhang's home. However, Zhang had already fled. Ding deduced that Zhang would not have gone far and might be hiding in the township clinic. When they arrived at the clinic, they indeed found the suspect and the evidence. This case was solved in just 6 hours from the time it was reported.

Ding Jia Nian has always insisted on civilized law enforcement, avoiding torture, coercion, and physical punishment of criminals. Last December, a pickpocket named Yang, who had traveled from Jiangxi to Taixing Bus Station to commit crimes, was caught in the act. At the police station, Yang refused to confess, even refusing to reveal his own name, and secretly swallowed a nail in an attempt to escape punishment by suicide. After the incident, Ding voluntarily sent him to the hospital for surgery and then stayed to nurse him. The other patients in the ward thought Yang was Ding's own son! Ding's actions moved Yang to tears. He finally confessed to Ding the entire truth of his crimes and repented for his actions.

    破案高手丁家年
    时下，犯罪分子作案手段较以往更加隐蔽狡猾。可是“道高一尺，魔高一丈”。作案者要是碰上江苏泰县公安局姜堰下坝派出所所长丁家年，即使是再狡猾的“狐狸”，恐怕也难逃这个好“猎手”的掌心。
    一天晚上，丁家年例行检查来到了金明旅馆，发现这里住进了一个从河南灵宝来的旅客索某。拉家常中，老丁发现这个人与其介绍信上注明的身份不大一致。老丁知道灵宝是著名的黄金之乡，凭着公安干警的敏感，他对来人产生了疑问。后来，此人经不住三盘两问，终于露了馅儿，老丁当场从索某和另一个同伙身上查出黄金515克，为国家挽回经济损失2万多元。
    去年6月的一天，泰县水利局黄村仓库发生一起盗窃案。接到报案后，丁家年和几个老搭档一起赶赴发案现场。经对掌握的线索进行分析，他认为本县桥头乡中沙村的张某有重大嫌疑。侦破组采纳了他的建议，当即直奔张某的家。不料，张已逃之夭夭。老丁断定此人不会走远，可能就藏在乡卫生院里。当大伙赶到卫生院时，果然人赃俱获。此案从案发到侦破，仅用了6个小时。
    丁家年历来坚持文明办案，逼、供、信，打、骂、体罚人犯的事儿与他无缘。去年12月的一天，扒窃犯杨某从江西流窜到泰县汽车站作案，刚下手就被擒获。在派出所，杨某拒不交待，连自己的姓名都不说，还偷偷地吞下一颗铁钉儿，企图用自杀来逃避惩处。事发后老丁主动送他去医院手术。随后，又留在医院护理。同病房的还以为此人是老丁的亲儿子呢！老丁的行动，使杨某感动得涕泪横流。他终于向老丁如实交待了自己作案的全部事实，忏悔了自己的所作所为。　（王向东　顾金鑫）
