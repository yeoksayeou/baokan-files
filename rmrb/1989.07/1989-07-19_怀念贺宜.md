Famous children's literature writer He Yi passed away two years ago, but I still feel as if he is alive, living in my heart...

I was not acquainted with Teacher He Yi. In 1975, I wrote a manuscript reflecting the lives of railway maintenance workers and sent it to a publishing house. He became my responsible editor. At that time, writing and editing books were both difficult tasks. Moreover, I was only a young worker with a primary school education, and my first attempt at writing a novel was a full-length work, which was obviously challenging. However, after reading my manuscript, He Yi believed that the work had a solid foundation in real life and that the main characters were vividly portrayed. He insisted on accepting it. From then on, he devoted all his efforts to nurturing me. Initially, we only communicated through letters, but every time he replied, he wrote very seriously. The shortest letters were five or six pages long, and the longest were more than ten pages. He always tried to explain everything thoroughly and gave specific feedback. Later, when I was invited to the publishing house to revise the manuscript, he worked even harder. During that time, he often discussed the work with me and gave me advice, helping me organize it chapter by chapter. He never acted superior, and whenever we talked, he always adopted a consultative tone. Even when he made changes, he would first ask for my opinion and use a pencil to make the changes before using red ink. At that time, in addition to being directly responsible for my manuscript, he was also the responsible editor for "The Oxherd's Hill." Editing two full-length novels simultaneously was a heavy burden for He Yi, who was already over sixty and suffering from multiple illnesses. Because of this, he often worked on "The Oxherd's Hill" during the day and on my "Railway Outpost" at night. What I will never forget is that after the manuscript was revised, due to the political climate at the time, it was rejected multiple times after being submitted for review. As the author, I found it hard to bear, but he remained calm. Later, when the higher-ups suggested that I rewrite the manuscript into an anti-capitalist work, he bravely refused despite the political pressure. "We cannot violate the laws of literary creation. The author has long lived at the grassroots level and has never been involved in the struggles of the upper echelons of the railway department. How can he write about 'anti-capitalists'?" In this way, he shielded me. After that, he also, despite his advanced age and poor health, traveled to Wuhu and walked along the railway lines I described for many days. Upon his return, he helped me revise the manuscript again. It was not until October 1977 that the book was finally published. Teacher He Yi had devoted so much effort to my debut work!

After 1978, Teacher He Yi not only resumed his leadership role at the publishing house but also began writing for children again. Those years, he was indeed very busy, and his health gradually deteriorated. However, whenever I visited him, he always insisted on chatting with me for a while, asking about my writing and life. He repeatedly told me: "Read more, continuously improve your literary cultivation. Make the foundation of your life solid, even more solid." Whenever I sent him letters, no matter how busy he was, he always replied. Around 1982, I wrote the children's novel "Thirteen Days of Truancy" and often got stuck, so I wrote to him for advice. He, despite being ill, wrote me a long letter, helping me analyze the root cause of my writer's block.

Teacher He Yi not only taught me how to write but also how to be a person. After "Railway Outpost" was published, he had repeatedly advised me: to be humble, truly humble, not the kind of humility that is merely for show. Once, when "Children's Era" held a short story contest, I had directly sent him a manuscript, but it was soon returned to me. In the letter, in addition to giving his opinions on the novel, he frankly told me: "I am a judge, and if I recommend it, it will give people a chance to criticize. I hope you can understand. After revising the work, it is better for you to send it directly to 'Children's Era'." Around 1983, I had repeatedly proposed to write his biography, but he declined. He humbly said: "My life is very ordinary, with almost nothing worth writing about. You should spend your precious time on meaningful creation."

In fact, Teacher He Yi had quietly cultivated the field of children's literature in our country for more than half a century. He left behind several million words of literary masterpieces for children. His humble and sincere virtues, and his serious attitude towards creation, are all worthy of being models for later generations. His teachings and love for me, I will forever cherish in my heart!

    怀念贺宜
    郎澜
    著名儿童文学作家贺宜逝世已两年了，但我仍觉得他还活着，活在我心中……
    我与贺宜老师原不相识。1975年，我写了一部反映铁道养路工人生活的书稿投寄到出版社，他做了我的责任编辑。那年月，写书编书都不易，况且我那会只是个仅有高小文化程度的青年工人，第一次写小说就写了个长篇，显然有难度。然而贺宜看罢书稿，认为作品有深厚的生活基础，主要人物写得都很活，还是坚持着接下来了。打那起，他便倾全力扶植我。起初，我们不过是书信联系，可他每次给我的复信，都写得极认真。少则五六页纸，多则十几页，他总是尽可能地把话说透，意见提得具体。后来我被请到出版社修改，他更是呕心沥血了。那阵儿，他常与我讨论作品，并替我出主意，一章一章地帮我理。他从不摆架子，每每交谈，总持商讨的口气，即便动笔，也是先征询我的意见，先拿铅笔改动，而后再红笔。当时，他除直接负责我的书稿外，还担任着《牵牛岗》的责任编辑。两部长篇同时定稿，这对已过花甲之年且又身患多种疾病的贺宜老师来说，无疑是很沉的压力。为此，他经常白天“牵牛”，晚间“开火车”（“牵牛”是指《牵牛岗》，“开火车”指我的《铁道前哨》）。尤令我难忘的是，书稿改定后，由于那时的政治气候，送审后一次次不能通过，我做为作者都难以承受得住，可他却能始终泰然处之。后来，当上面提出要我把书稿改写成“反走资派”的作品时，他又不顾政治压力，毅然回绝。“我们不能违背文学创作的规律。作者长期生活在基层，他对铁路部门上层的斗争从来没有过接触，你叫他写‘反走资派’，他怎么写得出来？”就这样，算替我扛住了。那以后，他还不顾年高体弱，专程跑到芜湖，沿着我所描写的铁道线走了好多天。返回后，又帮我再易其稿。直到1977年10月，此书才得以出版。贺宜老师为我的处女作，曾付出过多大的心血啊！
    1978年之后，贺宜老师不仅重新担负起出版社的领导职务，同时也开始又为孩子们写作了。那些年，他确实很忙，且身体也渐渐垮了，但只要我去看他，他总是要跟我聊一会的，问问我的创作和生活情况。他一再跟我说：“要多读书，要不断地提高自身的文学修养。要把生活的底子，打得扎实些，再扎实些。”但凡我给他的信件，他不管多忙，也总要作复。1982年间，我写儿童小说《逃学十三天》，不时卡壳，于是写信向他求教。他竟抱病为我写了封长信，帮我分析了卡壳的症结所在。
    贺宜老师不仅教我做文，更教我做人。《铁道前哨》出版后，他曾不止一次地告诫我：要谦虚，真正的谦虚，而不是那种专门为着装门面而做出的“谦虚”。有一次《儿童时代》举办小说征文，我曾直接寄给他一篇稿，可不久即将稿件退还我了。他在信中，除了对那篇小说提出自己的意见，还坦率地告诉我：“我是评委，若是由我推荐出去，会贻人口实的。希望你能谅解。作品改好后，还是你自己直接寄《儿童时代》为好。”1983年前后，我曾多次提出要为他写传的事，可他都谢绝了。他非常谦虚地说：“我这一生很平凡，几乎没什么可写的。你还是把宝贵时间，花在有意义的创作上吧。”
    其实，贺宜老师在我国儿童文学的园地里，默默地辛勤耕耘了半个多世纪，他为孩子们留下了几百万字的文学精品。他谦虚淳厚的美德，严谨的创作态度，都堪为后生楷模。他对我的教诲和厚爱，我将永远铭记在心中！
