Brazil's decision to delay the repayment of part of its debt has raised serious concerns among creditor banks.

	The People's Daily, Brasília, July 7th - Reporter Lán Cái Jī reports: The Brazilian government has decided to postpone the repayment of two installments of debt interest totaling $820 million to the Paris Club, which were due on July 3rd and 6th, until the country's foreign exchange reserves reach a "safe level." Many creditor banks have expressed doubts, fearing that Brazil might once again implement a policy similar to the one in 1987, when it stopped paying its external debts.

	The Brazilian Finance Minister stated that the delay in repaying part of the debt interest is merely a "temporary measure." He also mentioned that this measure is not only directed at the Paris Club but also applies to other international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund, the Japan Export-Import Bank, and the World Bank. When Brazil's foreign exchange reserves fall below a certain standard, the Brazilian government will adopt similar measures for the debts due to these institutions.

	According to figures released by the Brazilian Central Bank, Brazil's current international reserves stand at $5.6 billion, falling below the "safe level" of $6 billion. However, after recently announcing a 12% devaluation of the Brazilian currency against the U.S. dollar and implementing measures such as centralized management and exchange of foreign currency by the Central Bank, as well as restrictions on the remittance of profits and dividends by foreign-invested enterprises, it is expected that the international reserves will see a significant increase in the short term.

	Despite this, many foreign creditor banks remain concerned about Brazil's current economic situation and new debt policies. They believe that after the failure of the "Summer Plan" to control inflation in the first half of the year, inflation has surged, and the fiscal economy is in a state of chaos. With the change of government scheduled for early next year, the current government lacks effective measures to address the situation.

	Brazil has over $2 billion in debt interest due in September. If it is unable to repay this amount and fails to reach a new agreement to reschedule the debt, relations between Brazil and the creditor banks will once again become tense.

    巴西决定延期偿还部分债务
    引起债权银行疑虑重重
    本报巴西利亚7月7日电  记者兰才基报道：巴西政府决定将本月3日和6日到期的所欠巴黎俱乐部8.2亿美元的两笔债息延期到国库外汇储备达到“安全线”以上再付，不少债权银行重重疑虑，担心巴西将再次实行像1987年那样停止支付外债的政策。
    巴西财政部长表示，延付部分债息只是一个“权宜措施”，他还说，上述措施不只针对巴黎俱乐部，对其它国际金融机构，如国际货币基金组织、日本进出口银行以及世界银行等到期债款，在巴西外汇储备低于一定标准时，巴西政府亦将采取同样措施。
    按照巴西中央银行公布的数字，目前巴西的国际储备为56亿美元，降到了“安全线”60亿美元以下，但在最近宣布巴西货币与美元比价贬值12％并由中央银行统一管理和兑汇外汇、限制外资企业汇出利润和红利等一系措施后，国际储备可望短期内获得明显增长。
    尽管如此，不少外国债权银行对巴西目前的经济形势和新的债务政策仍然感到担忧，认为巴西在上半年执行抑制通货膨胀的“夏令计划”遭到失败以后，通胀急剧上升，财政经济处于混乱状态，明年初政权即将更迭，现政府已拿不出有力的治理措施。
    巴西9月将有20多亿美元到期债息需要偿付，如果无力偿付又达不成重新安排这笔债务的新协定，巴西与债权银行的关系将重新出现紧张。
