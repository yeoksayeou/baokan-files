If July comes to Kashgar, when you carry the unique fragrance of figs and cherish the sweet intentions like apricots, walking through the streets and alleys, pausing under the shade of ripening trees, just as you wipe the sweat from your brow, you will be surprised to find: almost every sweet-smelling, shady spot is where a few Uighur villagers are sleeping; some are families, some are alone, all with faces that are particularly sweet and content...

Want to say something to them? Wait a moment. Their lives are filled with countless budding wishes, strings of roasted lamb can no longer satisfy their colorful lives, the little lamb in their dreams is frolicking in the vast center of the Taklamakan Desert...

Want to wake them up? Be careful. Look, a drop of cool tear is silently rolling down from the cheek of a sleeping face. Your heart tightens.

Is it the old man thinking about that piece of Kunlun Mountain land, where his chest is riddled with scars but cannot grow enough to feed his family? Don't worry, that is already a memory the grandfather chews over for his children...

Is it the old woman thinking about that night when her youngest son, unable to snatch a sheep from the wolf's mouth, huddled in the snow and wind, not daring to go home? Don't be sad, that kind of life has long since faded away in the distant, melodious sound of the eagle flute...

If you come to this ancient city, with your head held higher than the local people's horses, treating Xinjiang as a daring adventure; or with the cold, indifferent eyes of an outsider, you disdain the primitive, simple warmth of the workshops in the small alleys; the vast wilderness, you can't find the warm light of the herdsmen's yurts... then, please don't be offended, don't take it to heart.

Even if the little boy wakes from his dream under the tree, he will just roll over and nestle back into his mother's soft, sturdy body.

You can ask, who has seen the unrestrained and passionate dance of Uighur girls and boys, those in the know will tell you, their love is too deep and rich, even the fragrant milk turns into lumps over time, sour and sweet, enjoyed all year round; their small hats, scarves, and clothes are all embroidered with flowers, lively and vivacious, as if they want to speak.

Their love is given with restraint, almost solemnly, but once given, it is as pure as clouds, boiling like milk tea, exceptionally warming to the heart.

Looking at the sleeping faces of the Uighur villagers, your first time out of the pass, your anxious heart should gently return to your chest, revealing your sincere smile, then, all your journeys will become heavy with affection, filled with meaning.

Border July, intoxicating emotions.

The tourist must leave, regretting that they can't take away this July's ripe apricots, lingering and reluctant, stopping and starting, but not knowing that this border city still has the sweet melons of August, the sweet grapes of October.

Friend, when you muster the heart to leave this land where passion has solidified, you can only temporarily put away this sharp, unbreakable knife of emotion. Know that the thick love you take away is just a drop of grape juice, a seed from a just-ripened pomegranate from the ancient city's summer...

    边疆七月情
    孙瑞兰
    七月若来到喀什，当你携着无花果的奇香，怀揣蜜杏般酣甜的情意，穿街绕巷，驻足于一株株成熟的绿荫下，刚想抹一把汗时，你会惊奇地发现：几乎每一片带甜味的阴凉地，都卧睡着几个维吾尔老乡；有的是一家人，有的是独个，神态都格外的甜，格外的惬意……
    想和他们说些什么吗？先等等。他们的生命里骚动着无数个正在发育的愿望，成串的烤羊肉香已调剂不了他们多彩的生活，他们的梦里的小羔羊正撒欢在塔克拉玛干广袤的中心……
    想惊醒他们吗？要小心。你看，有一滴清凉凉的泪正从一个熟睡的脸腮悄然滚落。你的心缩紧了。
    是老大爷想起了那块胸膛被凿得伤痕累累却生长不出温饱的昆仑山地？你别担心，那已是爷爷嚼给孩子们的回忆……
    是老阿娘想起了那个夜，小儿子因从狼嘴里夺不回家里的一只羊，赤脚蜷缩于风雪中不敢回家？不要伤心，那种生活如今已在悠扬的鹰笛声里消逝得很远很远……
    如果你来到这古城，头仰得比当地人骑的马还高，把新疆当作一次冒险的旅行；或是瞪着外乡冷漠的双眼，竟鄙视小巷手工作坊里叮当作响的原始、纯朴的亲切；荒野漠漠，找不到牧民毡房那一点温暖的灯光……那么，请你不要多心，不要见怪。
    就是树荫下的小巴郎醒了梦，他也会翻一个身，再枕进阿娘柔软厚实的身躯。
    你可以去问问，是谁见着了维吾尔姑娘、小伙子奔放多情的舞姿，知情的人可知，他们的情太多太浓，连醇香的牛奶日久都结成了疙瘩，酸酸甜甜，一年四季品尝不尽；他们身上的小帽、围巾、衣物到处都绣满了鲜花，活活泼泼似要张嘴诉说。
    他们的情奉献得很矜持，近乎慎重但只要奉献出了，便是白云般的纯，奶茶般的沸，格外的暖人心。
    看着维吾尔乡亲的睡容，你第一次出塞忐忑的心也该轻轻地放回怀里，露出你坦诚的笑，那么，你所有的旅程就会变得沉甸甸，拾满情，装满意。
    边城七月，醉人的情意。
    游客该走了，只恨带不走这七月杏熟，依依恋恋，走走停停，可不知道这边城还有八月的瓜酣，十月的葡萄甜。
    朋友，当你狠狠心走出这片热情凝结成的土地时，只好暂时收起这锋利无比的英吉莎小刀也割不断的情。要知道，你带走的浓情只是古城夏季的一滴葡萄汁，一颗刚启齿的石榴籽……
