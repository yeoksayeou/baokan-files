The greatest wisdom in the world is to be a good person.

Genuine scholars in China immerse their entire being in their studies, where their scholarship and character become one, as the saying goes, "Scholarship is the person."

Zheng Chaozong, who long served as a professor at Xiamen University, is such a scholar. Although Mr. Zheng has retired from his position as the head of the Chinese Department, he has left behind this slim volume, *Sea Shore Reminiscences*, which contains his reflections on several scholars, his evaluations of old books, and his recollections of past events and old customs. Every line is imbued with his personal integrity and exudes his scholarly demeanor. Rather than calling it a collection of reminiscences, it is better described as a book of moral lessons for young scholars.

"Hearing of many sincere people, I am happy to spend mornings and evenings with them." The scholars in Mr. Zheng's writings are deeply devoted to their studies and work, and what is particularly admirable is that they are sincere in their dealings with others, free from petty concerns, and kind-hearted, with benevolence as their foundation. The first person mentioned is Mr. Yu Qian, who is erudite and skilled in writing, yet does not rush to publish works to gain fame but instead devotes his passion to his teaching, free from worldly ambitions. Mr. Zheng writes about two principals of Xiamen University, Wang Yanan and Sa Bendu, who dedicated themselves to education, persevered, and were eager to guide their students. He writes about Xiong Dekui, who, during the years when the author was considered an "untouchable," still cared for this friend. He writes about Wu Mi's admiration for Chen Yinke's "speaking of Zhang Shi wherever he goes," and how he himself praises his contemporaries without the slightest trace of literary arrogance. He also writes about his close friend, the great scholar Qian Zhongshu, who reads large dictionaries, encyclopedias, and reference books like novels, absorbing them into his mind, and has a lot of "madness" in his scholarship, treating people like books without any prejudice. In 1957, when Mr. Zheng was implicated by his words and suffered for three years, Qian Zhongshu was one of the first to write to express his concern upon hearing the news of his "return to the ranks." He also writes about Lu Xun, who emphasized character and literary ethics, and Li Tuo, who, like his predecessor scholar Deng Zhicheng, would meticulously critique even a compilation of various books...

What particularly moved me was the author's reminiscences of his wife Lin Mingqing in the essay *In Memory of Mingqing* and his remembrance of Peng Boshan in *The Best Testimony of Loyalty and Integrity*. Among the ten million words in this collection of essays, I particularly admire Mr. Zheng's insightful and innovative analysis of Shakespeare's great tragedy *Julius Caesar*, which is often overlooked by many domestic and foreign drama critics, imbued with a strong sense of history, and can be considered the masterpiece of *Sea Shore Reminiscences*.

Mr. Zheng sincerely advises young people to read more and enrich themselves; he uses "friendship with the upright, the honest, and the learned" to enlighten his students; at the same time, he is immersed in the embrace of his motherland's rivers and mountains, bringing poetic beauty to the readers with an aesthetic eye. "Literature is the study of people," this scholar, who has deeply studied both Chinese and Western literature, has reached a realm of personal cultivation, where his character and his works are seamlessly integrated, and their essence is "benevolence" and "goodness."

In Chinese aesthetics, reaching the highest realm of goodness is also reaching the realm of beauty in the most fundamental and broadest sense. Mr. Zheng's *Sea Shore Reminiscences* not only reminiscences about the past but also propagates his philosophy of life, "doing good to others," which is the essence of the wisdom of being a good person.

"The highest is to establish virtue, the next is to establish merit, the next is to establish words. Even if they endure for a long time, they are called immortal." As an upright person, establishing virtue is the most fundamental. Scholars choose the path of scholarship because this way of life best embodies their virtuous nature. Regardless of who you are or what way of life you choose, you must adhere to the will to "do good" and take establishing virtue as your guiding principle. I think this is also the reason why *Sea Shore Reminiscences* touches the heart.

### 立德立言，虽久不废——读郑朝宗《海滨感旧集》

    立德立言，虽久不废
    ——读郑朝宗《海滨感旧集》
    徐怀谦
    世间最大的学问莫过于做人。
    中国的真诚的学者是把他的全部身心都沉浸于学问里，学问和他的人格已融为一体，正所谓的“学问即人”。
    长期执教于厦门大学的郑朝宗先生就是这样一位学者。虽然郑先生从中文系系主任职位上退了下来，但他留下这薄薄的一本《海滨感旧集》，却写了对几位学人的感怀，对旧书的评议，对旧事和旧风物的回想，字里行间充满了他的人品格调，流溢出他的做人的学问。与其称之为感旧散文集，不如说这是一本留给青年学子的喻世明言。
    “闻多素心人，乐与数晨夕”。郑先生笔下的学者对学问、对工作都热爱到了痴迷的程度，尤其可贵的是他们在做人上无机心，少俗虑，与人为善，以仁为本。开篇第一位余謇老先生学识渊博，又善属文，却不忙于写什么著作以流芳千古，而是满腔热情地用在他的特长教学方面，一点没有世俗的功利打算；郑先生写了厦门大学的两任校长王亚南先生和萨本栋先生投身教育，自强不息，乐于诱掖后进。写了熊德基在作者成为“不可接触的人”的年月，仍时刻关心着这位朋友；写了吴宓敬佩陈寅恪先生的“到处逢人说项斯”，他自己更是喜誉同辈，毫无文人相轻之陋习；也写了作者的挚友，一代大师钱钟书先生能把大字典、辞典、百科全书像看小说似的，逐条细读，而且吸入脑海，在做学问上颇多“痴气”，对人也像对书一样不存势利之见的人品，1957年郑先生以言语获咎，困顿三年，钱钟书是听见他“归队”的消息最先来信表示关怀的一个；他还写了讲求人格与文德的鲁迅先生、对前辈学者邓之诚先生一部撮录群书而成的类书也要摘瑕索瘢、毫不宽假的李拓之……他们的人格就像他们的学问风格一样实在、无矫饰、有个性。
    尤其使我感动的是作者追怀自己的妻子林铭清的散文《怀清录》和忆彭柏山的《赤胆贞心的最好见证》。而在这十万字的散文篇什之中，我特别佩服郑先生对莎士比亚被许多国内外剧评家忽视的大悲剧《裘力斯·凯撒》独具慧眼精炼创辟的分析，具有极强的历史感，称得上是《感旧集》中的压卷之作。
    郑先生真诚地劝导青年人多读书，充实自己；他以“友直，友谅，友多闻”来启迪自己的学生；同时他又在祖国的山河的怀抱里陶醉，以审美的眼光给读者带来了诗意。“文学是人学”，这位对中西文学都深有研究的学者人格修养已经达到了一种境界，他的人品和他的作品水乳交融，它的极处便是“仁”和“善”。
    在中国美学中，达到了善的最高境界，也就是在最根本和最广大的意义上达到了美的境界。郑先生的《感旧集》在感旧的同时宣扬了自己“与人为善”的人生哲学，这正是做人的学问的真谛。
    “太上有立德，其次有立功，其次有立言。虽久不废，此之谓不朽”。做为一个正直的人，立德是最根本的。学者之所以选择做学问这条人生之路，是因为这样活着能最好地体现他的立德本质。不管你是个什么样的人，选择了什么生存方式，你都必须坚持“向善”的意志，以立德为宗旨。我想这也是《海滨感旧集》之所以感人情怀的缘故吧。
