To ensure a bumper grain harvest this year, the government of Shitidi Town in our county decided to purchase a batch of high-quality seeds from outside the county and distribute them to the villagers. The seed allocation plan was finalized, but due to the lack of loan sources, the entire town was unable to purchase the seeds, and the sowing season was in jeopardy. Just as the town leaders were at their wits' end, Wang Qingyun, a civilized and law-abiding individual entrepreneur from Shitidi Town, lent the town 10,000 yuan, expressing his willingness to contribute to agricultural production.

Since obtaining his individual business license in 1981, Wang Qingyun has been law-abiding, courteous in service, and fair in transactions, making his business more and more prosperous. He has been commended and rewarded by leaders at all levels every year. After becoming wealthy, he did not forget the country or his fellow villagers. Inspired by Wang Qingyun, all individual entrepreneurs and villagers in the town took action, and within two days, they raised more than 80,000 yuan, promptly purchasing the high-quality seeds. This ensured that all villages and hamlets in the town could sow in time.

    正当买谷种急需资金时
    为了今年粮食大丰收，我县石堤镇政府决定从外地购进一批优良谷种，分配给村民。种子调拨计划落实了，但因无处贷款，全镇的谷种买不回来，眼看将延误播种季节。正当镇里领导人一愁莫展之时，石堤镇文明经营个体户王清云便借给镇里1万元，表示要为农业生产出一份力。
    王清云同志从1981年领取个体经商执照后，遵纪守法，礼貌服务，买卖公平，生意越做越红火，年年受到各级领导的表扬和奖励。他致富后，不忘国家，不忘乡亲。在王清云的带动下，全镇个体户和村民都行动起来，两天内就凑集了8万多元资金，及时购回了优良谷种，使全镇各村寨的农户能够适时播种。
