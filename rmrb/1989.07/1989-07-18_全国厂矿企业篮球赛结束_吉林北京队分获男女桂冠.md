The third National Factory and Enterprise Basketball Tournament concluded after 10 days of intense competition on July 17 in Jilin City. The host team, Jilin Waterworks Company, won the men's championship in their first appearance. Dalian Housing Office and Liaoning Jincity Paper Mill took second and third places, respectively. The women's championship was won by the Beijing Steel Company, with Liaoning Jincity Paper Mill and Anshan Bicycle Factory securing second and third places.

This tournament featured 25 men's and women's teams from 20 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, making it the largest and most technically proficient event of its kind to date. The competition was marked by a high number of young players and frequent three-point shots. However, there was a significant disparity in skill levels among the teams. Those trained through amateur programs struggled against teams composed of retired elite athletes, who in turn found it challenging to compete with teams of current elite athletes.

The call for social and enterprise-led sports development has been ongoing for several years, but effective methods for enterprises to field high-level sports teams have yet to be established. Enterprise teams face numerous challenges in scientific training, strict management, selecting outstanding athletes, nurturing future talent, and improving coaching skills. Without addressing these issues, enterprises will struggle to contribute high-level athletes to the nation.

    全国厂矿企业篮球赛结束
    吉林北京队分获男女桂冠
    本报吉林市7月18日电　第三届全国厂矿企业篮球赛经过10天争夺，17日在这里降下战幕。首次参赛的东道主吉林自来水公司队勇夺男子组桂冠，大连住宅办公室队和辽宁金城造纸厂队分获第2、3名。女子组冠军被首都钢铁公司队夺得，辽宁金城造纸厂队和鞍山自行车厂队列第2、3名。
    本届比赛，共有20个省、市、自治区的25支男女代表队参战。其规模和技术水平均超过前两届，而且各队以年轻队员为主，场上三分球得分屡见不鲜。但各队之间实力相差悬殊，以业余训练成长起来的队伍很难与由退役优秀队员组成的队伍较量，而由退役优秀队员组成的队伍又难以与现役优秀队员组成的队伍匹敌。
    社会办体育、企业办运动队的呼声喊了几年，可至今尚未找到最有效的企业办高水平运动队途径。企业办队在科学化训练与严格管理，优秀运动员的选拔，后备力量培养以及教练员业务能力等方面存在诸多问题需要解决。否则，企业无法真正为国家输送高水平运动员。
