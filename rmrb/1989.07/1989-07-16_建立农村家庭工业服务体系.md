Since 1984, in response to the need for developing a commodity economy in rural areas, our Qinghe County in Hebei Province has chosen to widely develop township enterprises with family industries as the mainstay, based on local conditions. Practice has proven that this is an effective way to promote the development of rural productive forces and achieve rapid poverty alleviation and prosperity.

Located in the southeastern part of Hebei Province, Qinghe County was once one of the 18 poorest counties in the province. With a population of 280,000 and 520,000 mu of arable land, 180,000 mu of which are sandy, barren, and saline-alkali land. Agricultural production has long been low and unstable, with the county relying on a portion of state-subsidized grain each year. County-owned industries are also a weak link. The county's finances have been in deficit, relying on state subsidies each year. Through several years of support and development, family commercial enterprises have reached nearly 20,000, accounting for 94% of the total number of township enterprises. There are 35,000 households engaged in industrial and commercial activities, with a workforce of over 60,000, accounting for more than 60% and 62% of the total, respectively. Four key industries have been formed: automobile parts, motorcycle cables, fine combed wool, and alloy tools, with over 2,600 processed product items. Products are sold to more than 20 provinces and cities nationwide, with some products exported abroad. In 1988, the county's total industrial and agricultural output value was 570 million yuan, of which family industry output value accounted for 410 million yuan. Rural family industries have driven Qinghe County to gradually develop from poverty to prosperity. The county's per capita rural income was 202 yuan in 1983 and reached 641 yuan in 1988. The county's finances have been in surplus since 1986, contributing 1 million yuan to the state in the previous year.

In recent years, one of the important reasons for the rapid development of family industries is that the county's leadership has gradually deepened their understanding of family industries through practical work, consciously guiding and supporting their development, and actively doing related service work.

Firstly, today's family industries, in terms of form, are mostly independent production units based on the family, but they are no longer self-sufficient economies. To obtain funds, raw materials, power, and other basic production elements, they must establish extensive connections with the social market. To obtain necessary technologies and services and continuously improve economic benefits, they need to establish extensive cooperative relationships with the outside world, and such cooperation has gone beyond geographical boundaries, becoming industry-based cooperation.

Secondly, today's family industries are different from traditional family handicrafts and small workshops. Most traditional family handicrafts and small workshops produce final products. Today's family industries produce mostly intermediate products, and in terms of variety, specifications, quantity, technology, etc., they must maintain close connections or joint operations with external entities.

Thirdly, Qinghe County's conditions for industrial development are relatively poor, with inconvenient transportation and no access to mountains, water, railways, or large cities. There are no mineral resources or local specialties. Local development of family industries must rely on both ends being "external."

The above reasons dictate that in Qinghe, relying solely on thousands of households to spontaneously develop family industries has significant difficulties. This has driven our county's relevant departments to place the establishment and development of a family industry service system on an important agenda.

Achieving Socialized, Serialized, and High-Quality Services

The so-called family industry service system is to establish a well-coordinated and orderly operating mechanism through various effective organizations in the internal structure and external environment of family industries. Family industries have many points of operation, many industries, and many products. To adapt to this situation, Qinghe has established multi-level, multi-content, and multi-form socialized service organizations, providing pre-production, in-production, and post-production serialized services. The term "multi-level" means that the state, collectives, and individuals all participate, with rational division of labor and coordinated services. The term "multi-content" means that services are provided in areas such as information, funds, raw materials, technology, transportation, and sales. The term "multi-form" means that there are various forms of service organizations, including service-oriented, business service-oriented, and labor service-oriented. This multi-level, multi-content, and multi-form combined service has formed a network structure throughout the county, penetrating every link of family industries. Whether it is information transmission, raw material supply, product sales, or goods transportation, settlement of accounts, etc., all services related to family industries are available.

To improve socialized serialized services, the county has organically combined the matching services of various functional departments with farmers' "self-service." The county's various functional departments, based on the principle of "providing services where farmers need them," have gradually established a matching service system suitable for the development of family industries. The County Township Enterprise Bureau, based on the needs of managing key industries, has established six specialized service companies for automobile parts, motorcycle cables, alloy tools, fine combed wool, building materials, and local industries. The first five companies are responsible for purchasing raw materials, selling products, providing information, guiding technology, supervising quality, and serving various links in production, supply, and sales for family industries. The local industry company mainly handles contract signing, shipment, collection, invoicing, and settlement procedures. There are 114 such specialized service companies under the jurisdiction of various county-level functional departments.

The so-called "self-service" refers to the emergence of various service organizations run by farmers. Currently, there are 253 such grassroots service organizations in the county. These service organizations are well-coordinated, flexible, and provide thorough and effective services. For example, the 38 grassroots cargo transportation service stations in the county specialize in handling cargo transportation and packaging for industrial and commercial households, responsible for the intermodal transportation business from Qinghe to seven railway stations in Jinan, Dezhou, Xingtai, Handan, Shijiazhuang, and other cities.

In response to the intense economic competition and the fact that various service organizations mostly provide paid services, the county has taken the lead and clearly proposed that services should be high-quality. With the rapid development of family industries, the first challenges encountered were poor market conditions and inconvenient transportation. The county party committee and government, in accordance with the urban construction plan, promptly carried out market environment construction, expanded the operating area of the original 20 markets, and built five specialized markets for wool, motorcycle cables, automobile parts, and alloy tools. They added more than 70 restaurants and hotels, increased more than 20 bus routes, and established 31 railway cargo stations. Various relevant parties have actively taken multiple measures to improve service attitudes and quality. The county postal system, in response to the dramatic increase in postal business, has increased and expanded service outlets, implemented 24-hour telephone and telegram services, directly delivered commercial parcels and commercial telegrams to households, improved postal sorting and dispatching work efficiency, and handled, opened, and loaded parcels up to thousands of items per person per day during peak periods. In 1988, they handled 249,700 commercial parcels, accounting for 3/4 of the total in 16 counties in Xingtai region.

Transforming Functions to Better Serve the Development of Family Industries

In this new historical period, the central task of the entire Party and the country is to carry out economic construction. The county's party committee, government, standing committee of the people's congress, political consultative conference, and disciplinary inspection committee have unified their thinking and believe that currently, supporting family industries and developing a commodity economy in the local area is the concretization of this central task. Each leadership team should start from their specific realities, transform their functions to adapt to the needs of this task, and serve this task.

Based on the actual situation, the county has reformed some functional departments and their work responsibilities in terms of the system. To enable the Township Enterprise Bureau to work more effectively, starting from the spring of 1986, we have decoupled this bureau from the county's finances, with wages and expenses solved through paid services, turning it into a government agency that does not rely on state funding. After taking up the "mud bowl," the pressure has become a driving force, and all 156 people in the bureau, except for 7 people responsible for daily administrative and logistical affairs, have gone to the 6 specialized companies to provide services. At the same time, the institutional system of township governments has also been reformed. Township finances have been established, implementing a responsibility system for revenues and expenditures. The institutions and personnel of 18 county-level departments, including finance, taxation, industry and commerce, statistics, public security, judicial, and civil affairs, have been transferred to the management of township governments. In some townships, the "three-thirds system" has been implemented, where 1/3 of the personnel are responsible for party affairs, administrative affairs, agriculture, and family planning; 1/3 of the personnel organize and mobilize the masses to develop commodity production and provide services for farmers engaged in industrial and commercial activities; and 1/3 of the personnel, in the form of "active decoupling," directly participate in the production and operation activities of township collective enterprises.

In the process of transforming the functions of government agencies, Qinghe County, to adapt to the new situation, has established new functional agencies, mainly two. One is the "Supporting Large Households Office," with leaders from the county party committee, standing committee of the people's congress, county government, and departments such as industry and commerce, taxation, banking, public security, and township enterprises participating. The main task is to do a good job in supporting large family industries, timely solving difficulties they encounter in information, funds, technology, talents, venues, energy, and raw material supply, and promoting the better development of family industries. The other is the market public security management organization. Since 1987, in response to the large number of merchants coming to Qinghe and the disorder in market transactions, personnel have been selected from the public security, transportation, and urban construction departments to establish a comprehensive management office. The main task is to strengthen public security and implement urban and rural safety prevention measures, strengthen the leadership of urban construction and environmental sanitation, plan and adjust commodity markets, and ensure the smooth development of urban and rural commodity economies.

    建立农村家庭工业服务体系

    农村家庭工业需要服务体系支持
    自1984年以来，适应农村发展商品经济的需要，我们河北省清河县从本地实际出发，做出了广泛发展以家庭工业为主体的乡镇企业的选择。实践证明，这是促进农村生产力发展，较快地脱贫致富的一条有效途径。
    位于河北省东南部的清河县，原是全省18个贫困县之一。县内28万人，52万亩耕地，其中沙荒盐碱地占18万亩。农业生产长期产量低而不稳，每年都吃国家一部分返销粮。县办工业更是薄弱环节。县财政入不抵出，年年吃国家一部分补贴。通过近几年的扶持发展，家庭工商企业近两万家，占乡镇企业总数的94％。务工经商户达3.5万多户，劳力达6万多人，分别占总数的60％和62％以上。形成汽车配件、摩托车拉线、精梳羊绒、合金刀具四大骨干行业，加工产品项目2600多种，产品销售到全国20多个省市，有部分产品出口到国外。1988年，全县工农业总产值为5.7亿，其中，家庭工业产值占4.1亿元。农村家庭工业推动清河县逐步沿着由贫到富的方向发展。全县农村人均收入，1983年为202元，1988年达641元。县财政从1986年起变为上交县，去年上交国家100万元。
    这几年，家庭工业之所以有较快发展的一个重要原因，是由于县委、县政府的“一班人”，在工作实践中逐步加深了对家庭工业的认识，能够比较自觉地去引导和扶持其发展，并且积极做好有关服务工作。
    第一，现今的家庭工业，从形式上看，它大多以家庭为独立的生产单位，但已不再是自给自足的经济。为了获得资金、原料、动力等基本生产要素，它不能不与社会市场发生广泛的联系。为了获取必须的技术、劳务，不断提高经济效益，它需要与外界发生大量的合作关系，而这种合作已迈过地缘界限，变为业缘结合。
    第二，现今的家庭工业，与传统的家庭手工业、小作坊也不同。传统的家庭手工业、小作坊，多数制造着最终产品。现今家庭工业的产品大多是中间产品，在品种、规格、数量、技术等方面，必须与外地保持密切的联系或联合联营。
    第三，清河县发展工业的自然条件较差，交通闭塞，不靠山、不靠水、不靠铁路、不靠大城市；没有矿产资源，没有地方特产。当地发展家庭工业，必须两头在“外”。
    以上原因，规定了在清河发展家庭工业，单靠千家万户自发生育发展有很大的困难。这驱使我们县的有关部门把建立和发展家庭工业服务体系放在重要的工作日程上。
    实现服务社会化系列化优质化
    所谓家庭工业服务体系，就是通过多种形式的有效组织，在家庭工业内部结构、外部环境方面，建立起成龙配套、正常有序的运转机制。家庭工业，摊点多，行业多，产品多。为适应这种情况，清河建立了多层次、多内容、多形式的社会化服务组织，提供产前、产中和产后的系列化服务。所谓多层次，就是坚持国家、集体、个人一齐上，合理分工，协同服务。所谓多内容，就是从信息、资金、原料、技术到运输、销售等方面开展系列化服务；所谓多形式，就是有服务型、经营服务型和劳动服务型等各种形式的服务组织。这种多层次、多内容、多形式相互结合的服务，形成了全县星罗棋布和纵横交错的网络结构，把服务工作渗透到家庭工业的每一个环节之中。无论是信息传递，原料供应、产品销售，还是货物外运、款项结算等等，凡是与家庭工业有关的各种服务应有尽有。
    为了搞好社会系列化服务，县里把各职能部门配套服务同农民的“自我服务”有机地结合起来。县属各职能部门本着“农民要求什么服务，就搞什么服务”的原则，逐步建立了适合家庭工业发展的配套服务体系。县乡镇企业局，根据骨干行业管理的需要，分别建立了汽车配件、摩托拉线、合金刀具、精梳羊绒、建筑建材、地方工业等6个专业服务公司。前5个对口为家庭工业采购原料，推销产品，提供信息，指导技术，监督质量，搞好产、供、销各个环节上的服务。地方工业公司主要代签合同和办理发货、托收、开发票、办理结算等手续。像乡镇企业局这样的对口专业服务公司属县直各职能部门管辖的共有114个。
    所谓开展“自我服务”，是指农民自办的各种服务组织应运而生。目前，全县户办和联办的民间服务组织有253个。这些服务组织，成龙配套，机动灵活，服务周到，效能显著。以全县38家民间货运服务站为例，他们专门为务工经商户代办托运、代办包装，负责从清河到济南、德州、邢台、邯郸、石家庄等7个火车站的联运业务。
    针对经济竞争比较激烈，各种服务组织多系有偿服务的情况，县里因势利导，明确提出服务应该优质化。随着家庭工业迅速发展首先遇到了市场条件差、交通不便的困难，县委、县政府按照城镇建设规划，及时进行了市场环境的建设，将原有20个集市扩大了经营场地，新建了羊绒、摩托车拉线、汽车配件、合金刀具等5个专业市场，增添了70多家饭店、旅馆，增加了20余个汽车客运班次，设立了31个火车托运站。各有关方面都积极采取多种措施，尽力改进服务态度，提高服务质量。县邮电系统适应邮电业务剧增的情况，增加和扩建了服务网点，实行电话电报业务昼夜营业，将商包、商情电报直接专送到户，提高邮政分拣封发工作效率，高峰期每天每人封发、开拆、装卸包裹达上千件。1988年他们进出口商包达24.97万件，占邢台地区16个县总量的3／4。
    转变职能，更好地为家庭工业发展服务
    新的历史时期，全党和全国的中心任务就是进行经济建设，在清河县委、政府、人大常委、政协、纪委五套班子统一了思想认识，认为目前在当地扶持家庭工业，发展商品经济，就是进行经济建设这个中心任务的具体化，各套班子都要从自己的具体实际出发，转变职能，以适应这一任务需要，为这一任务服务。
    根据实际情况，县里对一些职能部门及其工作职责，从体制上进行了改革。为了使乡镇企业局更有效地开展工作，从1986年春天开始，我们让这个局跟县财政脱钩，工资费用从有偿服务中解决，变成不吃“皇粮”的政府机关。他们端起“泥饭碗”以后，压力变动力，全局156人中除7人负责日常行政、后勤事务外，其余149人都下到6个专业性公司搞服务。而同时，对乡镇政府机构体制也进行了改革。建立了乡镇财政，实行收支包干。县财政、税务、工商统计、公安、司法、民政等18个县直部门下伸的机构和人员，归属乡镇政府管理。在有的乡镇还实行了干部分工负责的“三三制”，即1／3的人员从事党务、政务、农业、计划生育等日常工作；1／3的人员组织发动群众发展商品生产，为农民务工经商提供服务；1／3的人员以“活脱钩”的形式直接参与乡镇集体企业的生产经营活动。
    在转变机关工作职能的过程中，清河县为了适应新的情况建立了新的职能机构，最主要的是两个。一个是“支持大户办公室”，有县委、人大常委、县政府的领导同志及工商、税务、银行、公安、乡镇企业局等部门的负责人参加。主要任务就是做好支持家庭工业大户的工作，对他们在信息、资金、技术、人才、场地、能源和原材料供应等方面遇到的困难及时给以解决，以利于家庭工业更好地发展。再一个是市场治安管理组织。1987年以来，针对来清河的客商多和市场交易出现混乱的情况，从公安、交通、城建等部门抽调人员，成立了综合治理办公室。主要任务是强化治安和落实城乡安全防范措施，加强对城镇建设和环境卫生的领导，规划和调整集贸市场，以保证城乡商品经济顺利发展。
