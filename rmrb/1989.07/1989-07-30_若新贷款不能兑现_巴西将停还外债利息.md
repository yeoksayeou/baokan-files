Brazil's finance minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, announced on July 25 that if the international creditor banks fail to deliver the new loans promised last year, Brazil will suspend the payment of foreign debt interest due in September.

According to local newspapers on July 27, Zelia Cardoso de Mello stated during a meeting with Brazilian business leaders that the government's decision is not to confront the international creditor banks but to prevent Brazil's economy from further deterioration.

Brazil is the largest debtor nation in the Third World, with a total foreign debt of $120 billion. This September, Brazil needs to repay nearly $3 billion in foreign debt interest. Since the failure of Brazil's economic stabilization "Summer Plan" last month, the inflation rate has been rising steadily. President Sarney recently emphasized that the Brazilian government must now ensure price stability and prevent a decline in foreign exchange reserves.

    若新贷款不能兑现
    巴西将停还外债利息
    新华社里约热内卢7月27日电　巴西财政部长达诺布雷卡25日宣布，如果国际债权银行去年预定给巴西的新贷款不能兑现，巴西将停止偿还9月份到期的外债利息。
    据当地报纸27日报道，达诺布雷卡在同巴西企业界人士会晤时指出，巴西政府作出这一决定不是要同国际债权银行对抗，而是为了防止巴西的经济进一步恶化。
    巴西是第三世界最大债务国，外债总额高达1200亿美元。今年9月，巴西就需要偿还近30亿美元的外债利息。自从巴西稳定经济的“夏季计划”上月宣布失败以后，通货膨胀率不断上升。萨尔内总统最近强调，巴西政府现在必须保证防止物价失控和外汇储备不下降。
