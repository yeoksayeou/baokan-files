The past year was marked by abnormal weather and frequent disasters. The severe droughts that occurred during this period caused significant losses to food production in some countries and regions around the world. Since the beginning of this year, the drought situation has continued to worsen, posing a serious threat to global food production, people's livelihoods, and the ecological environment.

Severe Drought Conditions

Scientists believe that the large-scale release of chlorofluorocarbons in industry, which has led to a continuous decrease in the ozone layer, and the rapid increase in carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of coal, oil, and other fossil fuels, are important factors contributing to the recent rise in temperatures and drought conditions. In particular, 1988 saw the highest average global temperature in over 130 years. Many countries, including the United States, Canada, Argentina, the Soviet Union, and Australia, experienced some of the worst droughts in their history. In the United States, 33 out of 50 states experienced a 50-year drought, affecting 1,500 counties. From New Mexico to Pennsylvania, from Idaho to South Carolina, and from California to Texas, summer temperatures reached 37.8 degrees Celsius. Affected areas saw dried farmlands, cracked soil, and dried-up reservoirs. The Mississippi River, the largest river in the United States, saw a 37% reduction in water flow due to lowered water levels, causing over 3,000 barges and tugboats to run aground. In Missouri, Browning Lake dried up due to the drought, leaving thousands of large fish stranded and dead from lack of oxygen. Since 1989, abnormally high temperatures have caused persistent droughts in Kansas and Texas, two major grain-producing states in the United States, with some winter wheat already dead from the drought.

Since September 1988, Spain's northern regions have experienced rainfall below the average of the past 40 years. By January of this year, the drought in Spain had worsened, with rainfall dropping below the average of the past 50 years. Particularly in the Asturias region, the drought was the worst in over 100 years. From November of last year to January of this year, the total rainfall in England and Wales was only 130 millimeters, just half of the average since 1879. Since December 1988, regions in Southern Europe, North America, and South America have seen only 25% of the normal rainfall, while the Mediterranean coastal regions of Europe have seen almost no rain. In Africa, over 10 million environmental refugees have lost their homes and land due to drought. In South Asia, Bangladesh has experienced a severe drought this spring, the worst in decades.

Significant Reduction in Grain Production

The countries most affected by the droughts are those involved in grain production. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the global grain production in 1988 was approximately 1.734 billion tons, a decrease of 59 million tons or about 8% from 1987. This marks the first time in nearly half a century that global grain production has declined for two consecutive years. The United States, known as the "world's breadbasket," saw an even more severe reduction in grain production. In 1988, the United States produced only 1.9 billion tons of grain, the first time in history that production fell below consumption levels. Adding to the long-term export contract requirements, the United States was short by about 1 billion tons of grain in 1988. In North America, Canada's grain production decreased by over 30% in 1988. In Eastern Europe, grain production in 1988 was about 3% lower than in 1987. The Soviet Union's grain production in 1988 was 16 million tons less than in 1987, making it the worst harvest in three years.

The significant reduction in global grain production has led to a sharp decline in global grain reserves. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization reported that in 1987, global grain reserves were 402 million tons, enough to feed the world's population for 89 days. By the end of 1988 to 1989, global grain reserves had decreased by approximately 30%, or 280 million tons, enough to feed the world's population for only 54 days. This is the lowest level since the global food crisis of the early 1970s and the first time it has fallen below the minimum required to ensure global food security. Experts believe that global grain production must increase by 225 million tons, or 13% compared to 1988, to meet the minimum storage requirements and ensure global food security. However, based on the current situation, it is unlikely that grain production will increase by this much this year.

Water Shortages

Droughts have also led to water shortages, severely restricting industrial and domestic water use. In Spain, the drinking water crisis has forced the government to use tanker trucks to transport water. Reservoir water levels have dropped significantly, with some reservoirs holding only 10% of their original capacity. On the Uruguay River, half of the 14 hydroelectric turbines have stopped operating. In New York City and parts of southern New York State, the water shortage situation is very serious this spring. Reports indicate that the water level in the reservoirs supplying New York City has dropped from the usual 19% to the current 55%. To address this, authorities have implemented strict water-saving measures, such as closing decorative fountains, requiring all businesses to reduce water use by 20%, prohibiting the use of water for washing vehicles, sidewalks, roads, and building exteriors, banning the use of personal swimming pools, and imposing fines of up to $1,500 for violations. Additionally, to effectively utilize water resources, the New York City government has prioritized the renovation of water-saving toilets.

Furthermore, the continuous drought and water shortages have led to frequent forest fires. Since the beginning of this year, the Asturias region in Spain has experienced over 100 forest fires due to dry weather, burning over 1,100 hectares of forest. In March, two forest fires in southern New Jersey destroyed over 4,000 acres of pine forest. On April 11, another forest fire occurred in Florida.

    世界性干旱造成的后果不容忽视
    曲国斌
    过去的一年是气候异常、灾害频发的一年。这一年发生的特大干旱，使世界上一些国家和地区的粮食生产蒙受重大损失。今年以来，旱情仍在继续发展，这对今年的世界粮食生产、人民生活和生态环境构成了严重威胁。
    旱情严重
    科学家们认为，工业上氯氟烃气体的大量排放而引起的臭氧层的不断减少，以及人类大量燃烧煤炭和石油等矿物燃料产生的二氧化碳的急剧增加，是近两年气温升高和气候干旱的重要因素。尤其是1988年世界平均气温出现了130多年来的最高纪录，美国、加拿大、阿根廷、苏联、澳大利亚等许多国家都相继发生了历史上少有的干旱。美国全国50个州中有33个州的1500个县，去年发生了50年不遇的干旱，从新墨西哥州到宾夕法尼亚州，从爱达荷州到南卡罗莱纳州，从加利福尼亚州到得克萨斯州的夏季气温高达37.8摄氏度。受灾地区农田干枯、土地龟裂、水库干涸。美国最大的河流密西西比河，因河道水位下降，流量减少37％，结果使3000余艘拖轮和驳船中途搁浅。密苏里州的布朗宁湖因干旱水位下降，数千条大鱼干搁湖滩，缺氧而死。1989年以来，异常高温又使美国产粮大州堪萨斯州和得克萨斯州持续出现干旱，堪萨斯州的一些冬小麦已经旱死。
    西班牙自1988年9月份以后，其北部地区降雨量低于40多年来的平均值。进入今年1月，西班牙的旱情越发严重，降雨量已低于50多年来的平均值。特别是阿斯图里地区出现的干旱，是西班牙100多年来没有过的。从去年11月至今年1月，英国的英格兰和威尔士的总降雨量只有130毫米，仅相当于1879年以来平均降雨量的一半。自1988年12月以来，南欧、北美和南美等地区的降水量只有正常年份的25％；欧洲地中海沿岸地区几乎滴雨未下。非洲大陆因干旱而失去家园和土地的环境难民，目前已达1000万人以上。南亚的孟加拉国今年开春以来，出现数十年不遇的大旱。
    粮食减产
    遭受旱灾影响最大的是粮食生产。据联合国粮农组织预测，1988年世界粮食产量约为17.34亿吨，比1987年减少5900万吨，减少了8％左右。这是近半个世纪以来世界粮食生产第一次连续两年歉收。号称“世界粮仓”的美国，其粮食减产更为严重。1988年美国粮食产量只有1.9亿吨，是美国历史上粮食产量第一次低于消费量，加上长期出口合同的需要量，1988年美国要缺粮1亿吨左右。北美的加拿大1988年粮食减产30％以上。东欧地区1988年比1987年又减产3％左右。苏联1988年粮食产量比1987年减产1600万吨，是近3年来粮食收成最坏的一年。
    世界粮食产量的大幅度减少，引起了世界粮食贮量的急剧下降。联合国粮农组织说，1987年世界粮食贮量为4.02亿吨，只够全世界人口食用89天；而1988年底至1989年，世界粮食贮量大约减少30％，即减少2.8亿吨，其贮量只够全世界人口食用54天，这是自70年代初世界粮食危机以来的最低水平，并第一次低于保护世界粮食安全所必需的最低值。专家们认为，1989年世界粮食产量必须增加2.25亿吨，即比1988年增产13％，才能满足世界粮食最低限度的贮存和保证世界粮食安全的需要。但根据目前情况估测，今年已不可能增产这么多的粮食。
    水荒迭起
    干旱还引起水荒，使工业用水和生活用水大受限制。西班牙饮用水发生危机，政府不得不动用液罐卡车运水，水库的水位大幅度下降，其贮水量已剩到原贮水量的37％，有的水库已剩到原贮水量的10％。乌拉圭河上的14台水轮发电机有一半已停止运转。美国纽约市和纽约州南部一些地区，今年春季缺水情况非常严重。据报道，向纽约市区供水的蓄水池的水位已由通常的19％减少到现在的55％。为此有关当局不得不采取严厉的节水措施。比如关闭观赏用的喷水池；所有企业必须减少用水20％；不准用水冲洗车辆、人行道、公路和建筑物外壁；禁止向草坪和花园浇水；禁止使用个人游泳池；对于违反节水措施者要处以500美元、有的地区高达1500美元的罚款。除此之外，为了有效地利用水资源，纽约市政当局已将改造抽水马桶，作为一种重要的节水手段。
    此外，干旱缺水不断引起森林火灾。自今年初以来，西班牙阿斯图尔地区因气候干燥，已发生100多起森林火灾，毁林1100多公顷。美国新泽西州南部森林，今年3月17日发生两起森林火灾，使4000多英亩松林化为灰烬。4月11日，佛罗里达州又发生一起森林火灾。
