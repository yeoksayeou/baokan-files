Tianjin has been making sustained efforts to improve its investment environment, eliminating various unfavorable factors, and the momentum of foreign trade and economic development remains unabated.

From January to June this year, the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone added 12 foreign-invested projects, with a total investment of over $50 million. Of this, foreign investment accounted for $35 million, approximately 70%, an increase of 66% compared to the same period last year. Three projects were added in May and June. Several major projects that were delayed due to the turmoil are now resuming contact.

By the end of June, Tianjin's port exports had reached $184 million, completing half of the year's task in half the time. In terms of foreign economic cooperation, the city completed $12 million in foreign labor service contracts in the first half of the year, achieving 98.5% of the annual plan.

Facing the unfavorable factors of economic tightening and political turmoil in the first half of the year, the Tianjin municipal government has made multi-faceted efforts to create a new situation in economic and trade work:

* The mayor and vice-mayors have successively met with foreign businessmen to discuss the situation and listen to their opinions. The development zone has, within its capacity, quickly resolved issues related to household liquefied gas appliances, automobiles, power supply, and some scarce raw materials raised by foreign businessmen.

* The city has upheld its credibility. In the first half of the year, when domestic funds were tight, the Tianjin International Trust and Investment Corporation raised funds from various channels to pay off the principal and interest of foreign loans on time.

* The city has strengthened industrial and commercial cooperation, actively developed new products, and a batch of high-yield, high-foreign-exchange-earning goods have entered the international market. The Tianjin Machinery Import and Export Corporation, after building four cargo ships for Czechoslovakia, signed a contract this year with Bangladesh for 12,300-ton multi-purpose container ships.

    天津持续改善投资环境  外经外贸发展势头不减
    上半年新增外商投资项目12个创汇1.84亿美元
    本报天津7月19日电　记者肖荻报道：天津市在改善投资环境上作出持续努力，多方消除不利因素，外经外贸发展势头不减。
    今年1至6月天津经济技术开发区共增加外商投资项目12个，总投资额5000多万美元，其中外方投资3500万美元，约占70％，比去年同期增长66％，其中5、6月间增加3个项目。有几项因动乱而推迟的大项目，近日正恢复接触。
    截至6月底，天津口岸出口创汇达1.84亿美元，实现时间过半任务过半。在对外经济合作上，上半年全市实现对外劳务承包合同达1200万美元，完成了年计划的98.5％。
    面对今年上半年经济紧缩、政治动乱等不利因素，天津市政府作出多方努力，开创经贸工作新局面：
    ——市长、副市长先后会见外商谈形势、听意见，开发区在力所能及情况下，迅速解决了外商提出的家用液化器、汽车、供电及部分紧缺原材料问题。
    ——恪守信誉。在上半年国内资金紧张情况下，市国际信托投资公司多方筹集资金，如期支付了国外贷款的本息。
    ——加强工贸联合，积极开发新产品，一批效益好、创汇高的商品打入国际市场。市机械进出口公司继为捷克斯洛伐克建4艘货轮后，今年又与孟加拉国签定了12300万吨多用集装箱船的合同。
