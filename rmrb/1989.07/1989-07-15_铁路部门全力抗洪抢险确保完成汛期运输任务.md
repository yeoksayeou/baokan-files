Railway departments nationwide are making every effort to combat floods and ensure the completion of transportation tasks during the flood season.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 15 (Reporter Li Mei) Since July, railways across the country from south to north have entered the flood season. Some main lines have experienced water damage, disrupting transportation. The reporter learned from the Ministry of Railways that railway bureaus across the country are vigilantly monitoring the threats posed by heavy rains and water damage to railways, making every effort to combat floods and repair damage, and using every means possible to complete transportation tasks during the flood season.

According to statistics from early July, the main lines nationwide experienced 32 instances of track interruptions, resulting in 283 hours and 13 minutes of suspended train operations. Compared to the same period last year, the number of track interruptions decreased by 10, but the duration of suspended train operations increased by 69 hours and 3 minutes. Each railway bureau promptly established flood control command organizations, strengthened patrols on key sections, and assigned personnel to monitor dangerous areas to prevent potential hazards. Nationwide, there were 9 instances of stopping or detaining trains in flood-affected areas, accounting for 37.5% of the track interruptions, which prevented potential accidents.

Under difficult conditions, railway bureaus across the country promptly organized a large number of workers to combat floods and repair damaged sections, quickly restoring line operations. At the same time, they actively organized transportation to minimize the impact of disasters. As of early July, the nationwide daily average of loaded cars was 72,863, an increase of 4,947 cars per day compared to the same period last year; the daily average of unloaded cars was 76,898, an increase of 3,390 cars per day compared to the plan. Coal loading increased by 1,286 cars per day compared to the plan and 2,661 cars per day compared to the same period last year. All 12 railway bureaus nationwide completed their coal loading plans. The Harbin, Beijing, and Zhengzhou bureaus jointly organized 379 special coal trains for key users.

    铁路部门全力抗洪抢险确保完成汛期运输任务
    据新华社北京7月15日电  （记者李玫）7月份以来，全国铁路从南至北进入汛期，一些干线相继发生水害，运输中断。记者从铁道部了解，全国各铁路局的职工正在警惕地注视着暴雨、水害给铁路造成的威胁，全力抗洪抢险，千方百计完成汛期的运输任务。
    据7月上旬的统计，全路主要干线共发生断道32次，中断行车283小时13分，与去年同期相比，断道减少10次，中断行车时间增加69小时03分。各铁路局及时成立防洪指挥机构，对重点路段加强巡查，对危险处所随时派人监守，防患于未然。全路先后9次在水害地段拦停或扣发列车，占断道次数的37.5％，防止了可能发生的事故。
    在困难条件下，全国各铁路局及时组织广大职工开展抗洪抢险，修复水害路段，尽快恢复线路通车。同时积极组织运输，减少灾害的影响。截至7月上旬的统计，全路日均装车72863车，比去年同期每天多装4947车；卸车日均完成76898车，比计划每天多卸3390车。煤炭装车每天较计划多1286车，比去年同期每天多装2661车，全路12个铁路局都完成了煤炭装车计划。哈尔滨、北京、郑州三局共组织开行重点用户煤炭专列379列。
