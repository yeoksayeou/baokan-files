	Poem One
	The gunfire of August 1st shook the heavens, and the flames of revolution spread far and wide.
	The brave soldiers of Jinggangshan crossed the Huangyan Pass, and in the Great Marsh and Dongting Lake, they brandished their swords.

	Poem Two
	On July 7th, the nation rose up to drive out the invaders, and a hundred million heroes attacked the imperial court.
	Imperialism fled in disgrace, and from that day forward, China stood tall and unyielding.

	Poem Three
	War drums sounded at the southeastern gate, and the pigs met their end in the flames.
	The spirit of Dulles lingers, but his futile efforts to stir up trouble are in vain.

	Poem Four
	The Great Wall stands firm against all demons, unshaken by change and unarrogant in victory.
	With the suppression of violence and the pacification of the people, its reputation is justified. As the towers rise higher, one can see the waves of clouds.

    诗四首
    魏传统
                  一
    八一枪声震九霄，燎原星火战旗飘。
    井冈勇过黄洋界，大别洪湖各执刀。
                  二
    七七振兴驱敌寇，雄师百万捣王朝。
    殖民主义落荒去，从此中华不折腰。
                  三
    东南门户烽烟起，猪咀到头遇火烧。
    杜勒斯魂今不散，徒劳鼓噪卖风骚。
                  四
    长城屹立镇群妖，处变不惊胜不骄。
    平暴安民誉合格，层楼再上看云涛。
