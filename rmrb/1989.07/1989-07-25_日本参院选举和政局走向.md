The 15th election for Japan's House of Councillors ended with a "defeat" for the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and a "victory" for the Socialist Party. As a result, Prime Minister Uno, who had been in office for less than two months, was forced to announce his resignation from the LDP presidency and the premiership, taking responsibility for the party's electoral failure. Japan's political landscape once again fell into turmoil.

The House of Councillors in Japan changes half of its seats every three years. This time, 126 seats were up for grabs. The LDP aimed to secure at least 54 of these seats to maintain its majority in the House of Councillors. Since its founding, the LDP has always held a majority in the House of Councillors. However, the situation this time was different. Given the recent losses in the Niigata prefectural by-election and the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election, the LDP had a grim outlook before the election. They hoped to secure more than 40 seats to avoid Uno's resignation and to continue governing until the end of his term in October. However, the election results showed that the LDP only won 36 seats, falling short of a majority when combined with their existing seats. This is the first time since the LDP's establishment in 1955 that it has not secured a majority in a House of Councillors election.

The reasons for the LDP's defeat in the House of Councillors election can be summarized as "three major issues and one minor issue." First, the consumption tax law, which was forced through the Diet, has caused widespread dissatisfaction since its implementation. During the campaign, the LDP promised to amend the consumption tax but did not provide specific measures. Second, the Recruit scandal has further fueled public discontent with money politics. Although the LDP has expressed a desire to reform politics and regain public trust, it has not made convincing progress. Third, farmers are dissatisfied with the LDP's agricultural policies, causing the party to lose a significant voting bloc. Fourth, Prime Minister Uno's personal scandal has tarnished the LDP's image. In short, the LDP's defeat is due to a loss of public trust.

Uno's resignation has plunged Japan's political landscape into turmoil once again. The LDP's immediate task is to elect a new president. Currently, the prevailing opinion within the party is to elect a new president through a party-wide vote of Diet members, opposing the practice of the previous president appointing a successor in a "backroom deal." The LDP aims to elect a new president within a month to avoid prolonged political instability. Whether the new president is a transitional figure until the end of October or someone with a long-term vision is also a point of interest. The opposition parties, led by the Socialist Party, are taking advantage of the situation to demand the dissolution of the House of Representatives and a general election to expand their gains and force the LDP to relinquish power.

The results of the House of Councillors election reflect the Japanese public's desire for political change. The opposition parties now hold a majority in the House of Councillors, while the ruling party maintains a majority in the House of Representatives. This marks a new change in Japan's political landscape after 34 years. Although the House of Representatives has the upper hand, if the House of Representatives passes a bill and the House of Councillors makes a different decision, the bill can still become law if the House of Representatives passes it again with a two-thirds majority. The LDP will not easily hand over power to the opposition, but Japan's politics are indeed entering a new era, one of change and uncertainty.

July 24th, after being in office for only 52 days, Japanese Prime Minister Uno Sosuke announced his resignation from the premiership and the LDP presidency at a press conference held at the LDP headquarters in Tokyo, taking responsibility for the party's defeat in the House of Councillors election.

    日本参院选举和政局走向
    本报记者  于青
    日本第15届参议院选举，以自民党的“惨败”与社会党的“大胜”而告终。至此，执政不满两个月的新任首相宇野被迫宣布承担自民党选举失败的责任，并辞去自民党总裁和政府首相职务，日本政局再度陷于混乱。
      日本参院每3年改选半数议席，这次改选126议席。自民党争取获得其中至少54议席，力图继续在参院维持多数议席。自民党建党以来，一直在参院保有多数议席，而这次的形势今非昔比。鉴于不久前的新澙县参议员补选、东京都议会选举失利的结局，选举前，自民党预感形势严峻，奢望不高，以为只要获得40多个议席，就可避免宇野首相辞职，使之执政到10月底任期届满。然而选举结果，自民党仅获36席，加上原有议席，在参议院内不足半数。这是自民党自1955年建党以来在历届参议院选举中未有过的。
    自民党参院选举失利的原因是“三大件加一小件”。一、消费税法案在国会强行通过，实施以来引起普遍不满。竞选中自民党许诺将修改消费税，但没有提出明确的具体措施；二、利库路特事件发生以来，日本国民对金权政治更加不满。自民党虽然表示要进行政治改革，恢复国民信赖，但没有取得令人信服的进展；三、农民对自民党的农业政策不满，使自民党失去固有的这块大票田；四、宇野首相生活不检点的丑闻，使自民党形象受到影响。一言蔽之，自民党失利的原因是失信于民。
    宇野首相辞职使日本政局又处于动荡之中。自民党的当务之急是选出新总裁。目前，党内占主流的意见是主张通过本党国会议员选举出新总裁，反对前任总裁指名新总裁那种“密室政治”。自民党争取一个月之内尽快选出新总裁，力避政局长期动荡。继任新总裁是过渡到10月末的暂定人选，还是立足长期政权的人选也是引人注目之点。以社会党为首的在野党乘势要求解散众院，举行大选，以求扩大战果，迫使自民党交出政权。
    参院选举结果，是日本国民要求改变当今政治的意识折射。参院在野党占多数，众院执政党占多数的局面形成，表明34年以来日本政治格局发生了新变化。虽然参议院与众议院相比，众议院有优先权。众院通过而参议院作出不同决议时，经众院出席议员2／3以上的多数再次通过时，即成法律；自民党也不会轻易把政权拱手让给在野党，但日本政治毕竟将进入一个新时期，一个伴随多变的时期。

    七月二十四日，执政仅五十二天的日本首相宇野宗佑在东京自民党总部举行的记者招待会上宣布辞去内阁首相和自民党总裁的职务，以承担自民党在参院选举中败北的责任。
