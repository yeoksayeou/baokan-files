    Pioneering Leader in Hardship
    —Recalling Laiyang City Labor Reform Brigade Commander and Party Secretary Qiu Lunshan
    Yu Yu, Chen Fu

    Qiu Lunshan is well-known in the Shandong Province labor reform system. When the Laiyang City Labor Reform Brigade was established, it didn't even have a wall. Under extremely difficult conditions, he led over 500 officers and staff, through arduous efforts, completed the task assigned by higher authorities to establish the brigade and detain prisoners within three months. Over the past five years, the brigade has implemented legal, civilized, and scientific management for over 3,700 detainees, maintaining a stable order within the prison. It has been evaluated as a "100-day safety excellent unit" by the Shandong Province Labor Reform Bureau for four consecutive times.

    The heavy machinery factory established by the Laiyang City Labor Reform Brigade has developed from a single mechanical product to three categories: machinery, metallurgy, and casting, with more than 10 products. They have established technical collaborations with more than 10 research institutions and universities, jointly developing 14 new products. Among these, the roll leveling machine set and the H-type steel straightening machine are key national development projects and fill domestic gaps, respectively. They have also collaborated with foreign trade departments and relevant factories to establish the Shandong Province Steel Pipe Joint Venture Company, exporting products such as black welded pipes and galvanized welded pipes to Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, Western Europe, the United States, and the Middle East. Last year, they earned 4.7 million US dollars in export revenue, being evaluated as an advanced unit for mechanical and electrical product export earnings nationwide. They were approved by the State Council's Mechanical and Electrical Export Office as an export expansion enterprise, proudly entering the ranks of provincial-level advanced enterprises.

    Because of the excellent management and production, in 1987, the brigade and Qiu Lunshan were awarded a collective second-class merit and individual second-class merit by the Shandong Province Justice Department; recently, Qiu Lunshan was awarded an individual first-class merit by the Shandong Province Justice Department.

    "To do business, one must prioritize people's hearts," Qiu Lunshan often pays attention to ideological and political work. From the party committee to various branches in this brigade, they have formulated ideological and political work goals, breaking down tasks and assigning them to individuals, making them quantifiable and institutionalized. They closely combine with the ideological issues that arise during the reform, deeply carrying out work. This brigade has introduced a competitive mechanism into the personnel system, promoting those who are capable and demoting those who are not. They have removed 7 mid-level cadres and recruited 16 workers as cadres, which has caused some people to comment and express dissatisfaction. Qiu Lunshan firmly criticizes and fights against wrong thoughts, and together with other party committee members, he talks to individuals, making this reform smoothly continue.

    艰苦创业的带头人
    ——记莱阳市劳改支队队长兼党委书记邱仑山
    于宇　陈浮
    邱仑山在山东省劳改系统小有名气。他所在的莱阳市劳改支队，建队时连围墙都没有。在极其困难的条件下，他带领500多名干警、职工，经过艰苦努力，完成了上级交给的建队3个月后收押犯人的任务。5年来，支队先后对3700多名在押犯人实行了依法、文明和科学管理，使狱内秩序一直很稳定，连续4次被山东省劳改局评为百日安全全优单位。
    莱阳市劳改支队办的重型机械厂，从单一的机械产品发展为机械、冶金、铸造3大类10多个产品；他们与10多个科研单位和大专院校建立了技术联合，共同研制开发了14种新产品，其中卷矫平机组和H型钢矫直机分别属于国家重点开发项目和填补国内空白项目；他们与外贸部门和有关厂家联合成立了山东省钢管联合公司，把厂里生产的黑皮焊管、镀锌焊管等产品远销香港、东南亚、西欧、美国和中东等国家和地区。去年出口创汇470万美元，被评为全国机电产品出口创汇先进单位，被国务院机电出口办公室批准为出口扩权企业，光荣地进入省级先进企业行列。
    因为管教和生产“双优”，1987年，支队和邱仑山就被山东省司法厅记了集体二等功和个人二等功；最近，邱仑山又被山东省司法厅记了个人一等功。
    “干事业以人心为本”，邱仑山经常注意做人的思想政治工作。这个支队从党委到各个支部，都制定了思想政治工作奋斗目标，把任务分解落实到人，使之指标化、制度化，密切结合改革中出现的思想问题深入地开展工作。这个支队把竞争机制引入人事制度，有能者上，无能者下，先后免去7名中层干部，招聘了16名工人当干部，曾引起一些人的议论和不满。邱仑山对错误的思想坚决进行批评和斗争，并和党委其他同志分头找人谈话，使这一改革顺利坚持了下来。
