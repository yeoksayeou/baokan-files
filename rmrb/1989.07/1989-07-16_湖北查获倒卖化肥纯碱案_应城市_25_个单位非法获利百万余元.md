    The Hubei Provincial Audit Bureau recently uncovered a series of cases involving the illegal sale of fertilizer and soda ash. The audit revealed that 25 units in Yingcheng City were involved in these illegal activities, collectively selling 1,240 tons of fertilizer and 3,779 tons of soda ash. These units and individuals illegally earned a total of 1.31 million yuan. The Hubei Provincial Government has taken this matter seriously and has instructed relevant departments and Yingcheng City to thoroughly investigate and handle the cases.

    In 1988, some administrative departments in Yingcheng City obtained quotas for fertilizer and soda ash from the Hubei Chemical Factory, which they then transferred to subordinate units and companies for resale at a higher price. A total of 120 tons of fertilizer and 670 tons of soda ash were involved, generating a profit of 188,000 yuan. The Municipal Economic Commission, for instance, handed over 60 tons of soda ash quotas to the Industrial Technology Consulting Service Company under its jurisdiction. This company sold the soda ash at a price of 440 yuan per ton more than the original price to a certain enterprise, earning a profit of 26,000 yuan.

    Some departments and units in Yingcheng City also obtained quotas for fertilizer and soda ash through various channels and then resold them. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, for example, obtained 50 tons each of fertilizer and soda ash under the pretext of "work needs." They immediately sold these to the Municipal Light Industry Bureau's Material Supply Company. Subsequently, they took 59 pieces of furniture, including sofas and coffee tables, from a certain furniture factory, and the Material Supply Company paid for all of them. They also took 20 cubic meters of fir wood, valued at 16,000 yuan.

    Some individuals in Yingcheng City also used their units' names to obtain quotas and then resold them for personal gain. Some of them divided the resale profits among themselves, while others exchanged the quotas for scarce consumer goods at low prices. It has been confirmed that 25 individuals collectively resold 280 tons of fertilizer and 40 tons of soda ash, earning a profit of 36,000 yuan.

    湖北查获倒卖化肥纯碱案
    应城市25个单位非法获利百万余元
    本报讯　记者张锦力报道：记者从审计署获悉：最近湖北省审计局查出一批倒卖化肥、纯碱案。审计查明，应城市有25个单位参加了倒卖活动，共计倒卖化肥1240吨，纯碱3779吨。单位和个人共获非法收入131万元。湖北省政府对此十分重视，已责成省有关部门和应城市认真查处。
    1988年，应城市一些行政主管部门从省化工厂批到一批化肥和纯碱指标，然后交给下属单位和公司加价倒卖，共计化肥120吨、纯碱670吨，获取差价收入18.8万元。其中，市经委还将60吨纯碱指标交给所属工业技术咨询服务公司经营，该公司将每吨加价440元卖给某企业，获差价2.6万多元。
    应城市还有一些部门、单位将通过各种关系渠道所得化肥和纯碱指标，转手倒卖。市公安局以“工作业务需要”为由，批到化肥、纯碱各50吨，当即转卖给市轻工局物资经销公司，尔后从某家具厂拉走沙发、茶几59件，全部由物资供销公司付款，并从物资供销公司拉走杉木20立方米，共值16000元。
    应城市还有一些人以单位的名义出公函要指标，然后个人倒卖牟利。他们有的将倒卖加价款合伙私分，有的将批条低价换取紧俏消费品。已查清有25人共倒卖化肥280吨，纯碱40吨，获利达36000多元。
