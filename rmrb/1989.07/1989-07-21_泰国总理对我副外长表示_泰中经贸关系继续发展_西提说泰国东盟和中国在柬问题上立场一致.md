	Thai Prime Minister Expresses to Chinese Vice Foreign Minister on Continued Development of Sino-Thai Economic and Trade Relations
	Thai Foreign Minister Says Thailand and ASEAN Hold Consistent Stances with China on the Cambodian Issue

	Bangkok, July 21 (Xinhua) — Reporter Liu Aicheng reports: “Thailand has expressed great concern over the developments in China. Now that we know China has restored normal order, we are pleased. The Thai government has always adopted a very cautious attitude towards this matter. Because the relations between China and Thailand have now reached a peak. Thailand does not want this relationship to be damaged, and most of the Thai people understand this. The economic and trade relations between the two countries will continue to develop, and Thailand has not stopped any delegation from visiting China. Thailand hopes that the situation in China will completely return to normal.” This is what Thai Prime Minister Chatichai said to the visiting Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Liu Shucai today. Vice Minister Liu briefed Chatichai on the recent turmoil in China, including the student protests, riots, and counter-revolutionary rebellion, as well as the necessary and correct measures taken by the Chinese Communist Party and the government.

	Vice Minister Liu expressed gratitude for the correct and friendly attitude adopted by the Thai government. He emphasized that China’s foreign policy and open-door policy have not changed. China will continue to develop friendly relations with Thailand.

	Regarding the Cambodian issue, Prime Minister Chatichai stated that Thailand adheres to two basic principles: Vietnam must truly withdraw its troops, and a four-party coalition government must be established.

	Last night, Vice Minister Liu Shucai also met with Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila, focusing on discussions about the Cambodian issue and exchanging views on the convening of the Paris International Conference. Foreign Minister Siddhi briefed on the situation of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting, pointing out that ASEAN countries unanimously advocate for a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Cambodian issue. This stance of ASEAN has also been supported by all dialogue partners.

	Vice Minister Liu expressed support for the joint communiqué issued by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting, stating that China welcomes the convening of the Paris International Conference and hopes for a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable solution to the Cambodian issue. To achieve this goal, Vietnam must withdraw all its troops from Cambodia by the end of September this year, without leaving any military personnel in any form, and without any pretext for re-entering Cambodia. For this purpose, a strict and effective international supervision mechanism must be established. To maintain peace and stability in Cambodia, prevent civil war, and promote national reconciliation, a four-party coalition government led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk must be established. Only in this way can the Cambodian issue be truly resolved.

	Foreign Minister Siddhi pointed out that the stances of Thailand, ASEAN, and China are consistent, and hopes for full cooperation at the Paris International Conference.

    泰国总理对我副外长表示
    泰中经贸关系继续发展
    西提说泰国东盟和中国在柬问题上立场一致
    本报曼谷7月21日电  记者刘爱成报道，“泰国对中国事态的发展曾经表示很大的担忧，现在知道中国恢复了正常秩序，对此感到高兴。在对待这件事情上，泰国政府一直采取十分慎重态度。因为中泰两国关系现在发展到了一个高峰。泰国不愿使这种关系受到损害，泰国的老百姓大多数是理解的。两国经济贸易关系继续发展，泰国没有阻止任何一个代表团访问中国。泰国希望中国局势完全恢复正常。”这是今天泰国总理差猜对来访的中国外交部副部长刘述卿说这番话的。刘副部长向差猜总理通报了我国最近发生的学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱情况，以及我国党和政府采取必要的正确措施。
    刘副部长对泰国政府采取的上述正确友好态度表示感谢。同时强调中国的外交政策和对外开放政策都没有改变。中国将继续发展同泰国的友好关系。
    在谈到柬埔寨问题时，差猜总理表示，泰国在柬问题上坚持两项基本原则，即：越南必须真正撤军和建立四方联合政府。
    昨天晚上，刘述卿副部长还会见了泰国外长西提，着重讨论了柬埔寨问题，并就召开巴黎国际会议问题交换了意见。西提外长通报了东盟外长会议的情况，指出东盟国家一致主张柬问题应得到全面、持久的解决。东盟的这一立场也得到了所有对话国的支持。
    刘副部长表示支持东盟外长会议发表的联合公报，指出中国欢迎召开巴黎国际会议，希望柬问题得到全面、公正、合理的解决。为了实现这个目标，越南必须在今年9月底以前从柬真正撤走全部军队，不能以任何方式留下军事人员，不能以任何借口重新返回柬埔寨。为此，必须建立严格、有效的国际监督机制。为了维护柬埔寨的和平稳定，避免发生内战，促进民族和解，必须建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方联合政府。只有这样，才能使柬问题获得真正解决。
    西提外长指出，泰国、东盟与中国的立场是一致的，希望在巴黎国际会议上充分合作。
