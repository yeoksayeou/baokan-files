Gorbachev Speaks on Television About the Miners' Strike
Workers Should Not Choose to Strike

MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) — Soviet leader Gorbachev spoke on Soviet Central Television on the evening of the 23rd about the coal miners' strike, saying that a strike is not the path workers should choose. "If the tense situation continues and worsens, it will seriously affect the country's economy."

Since the 10th of this month, miners in the main coal-producing areas of the Soviet Union have gone on strike one after another. The situation has now somewhat eased. Miners in Kuzbass and Karaganda in South Siberia and Kazakhstan have resumed work. The strike committee of the miners in the Donbass region has also reached an agreement with the government committee handling the strike, and some coal mines are expected to resume operations.

Gorbachev said in his television speech that there are indeed many problems that need to be solved immediately in the coal industry. He believes that these problems exist to varying degrees in all economic sectors and in the social lives of the people.

When discussing what lessons and conclusions should be drawn from the strike, Gorbachev said that this first of all shows that "we need reform." He said that the miners support reform and are dissatisfied with the pace of reform. He believes that what is important now is to take decisive measures to remove all obstacles to economic reform.

The strike has had a serious impact on many sectors of the Soviet national economy. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Ryzhkov said in a telegram to the striking workers in the Donbass region on the 22nd: "The situation in some sectors of the national economy is already on the brink of crisis."

    戈尔巴乔夫就矿工罢工发表电视谈话
    工人不应选择罢工
    新华社莫斯科7月23日电　（记者俱孟军）苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫23日晚上就煤矿工人罢工问题在苏联中央电视台发表谈话说，罢工不是工人应当选择的道路，“如果紧张局势进一步持续和恶化，就会严重地影响国家的经济”。
    自本月10日以来，苏联主要产煤区的矿工相继罢工。目前，整个局势有所缓和。南西伯利亚的库兹巴斯和哈萨克卡拉干达产煤区的矿工已经复工。顿巴斯的矿工罢工委员会也与处理罢工问题的政府委员会达成协议，一些煤矿可望复工。
    戈尔巴乔夫在电视谈话中说，采煤业中的确积累了许许多多应当立即解决的问题。他认为，这些问题也不同程度地存在于所有的经济领域和人民的社会生活中。
    在谈到应当从罢工事件中得出什么教训和结论时，戈尔巴乔夫说，这首先表明“我们需要改革”。他表示，矿工们是支持改革的，他们不满的是改革的进程。他认为，现在重要的是坚决采取必要的措施，清除经济改革中的一切障碍。
    罢工已对苏联国民经济的许多部门造成严重影响。戈尔巴乔夫和政府总理雷日科夫22日在给顿巴斯罢工工人的电报中说：“某些国民经济部门的形势已处于危机的边缘”。
