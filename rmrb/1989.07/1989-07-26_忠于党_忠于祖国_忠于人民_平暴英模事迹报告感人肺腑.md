People's Liberation Army General Political Department held a report meeting on the heroic deeds of the capital's martial law troops in quelling the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing today.

Central Military Commission leaders Liu Huaqing, Qin Jiwei, Yang Baibing, and Zhao Nanqi, as well as more than 1,600 officers and soldiers from various large units stationed in Beijing and the martial law troops, attended the meeting. Six heroes introduced their outstanding contributions to defending the Party and the socialist People's Republic in the major political struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riots. They are: Li Lianchun, a representative of a certain reconnaissance battalion who bravely took the lead in quelling the counter-revolutionary riots; Zhang Zhen, a driver who was attacked three times by rioters, suffered twelve injuries all over his body, and refused to let go of the steering wheel even in the face of death; Yu Aijun, a soldier who lost his right eye defending the republic; You De'gao, a platoon leader of a certain unit who sacrificed his family's interests and dedicated his sincere love to the republic; An Weiping, a staff member who bravely and intelligently completed missions alone twenty-one times; and Liu Jianjun, a representative of a certain reconnaissance company who participated in the clearing of Tiananmen Square.

Deputy Director of the General Political Department Zhou Wenyan spoke on behalf of the Military Commission and the three General Departments. He said that during the process of stopping the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary riots, the reason why the army officers and soldiers were loyal to the Party, firm in their stance, clear in their banner, and resolutely followed the commands of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission was that the broad masses of officers and soldiers deeply understood that the interests of the Party and the people are one. Loyalty to the Party is loyalty to the people, and executing the Party's instructions is executing the will of the people. No matter how many rumors spread in society or how perilous the situation became, the army officers and soldiers always maintained a clear mind, firmly believed in the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, resolutely executed the Party's instructions, and followed the Party's commands. They withstood various complex situations, maintained the correct political direction, and overcame all kinds of difficulties.

Zhou Wenyan said that on the occasion of commemorating the 62-year glorious journey of our army, all units should thoroughly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and carry out the learning activities of learning from the martial law troops and the "Guardians of the Republic" more extensively and effectively. They should remember the Party's teachings, maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee, and maintain a firm and correct political direction; they should remember the army's mission, regard the interests of the country and the people as supreme, be willing to sacrifice everything for the interests of the country and the people, and serve the people wholeheartedly; they should remember the army's fine traditions, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and always maintain the political character of selfless dedication and hard work; they should remember the army's functions, be loyal to their duties, strictly observe discipline, advance with the victory, and carry the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riots to the end.
