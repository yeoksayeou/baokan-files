According to officials from the State Land Administration, the actual arable land area in China is larger than the currently available statistics. The primary reason is the inaccurate land statistics reported by various regions.

It is understood that the State Statistical Bureau currently has a figure of 14.36 billion mu for the national arable land area. However, the ongoing national land use status survey (detailed land survey) by the State Land Administration indicates that there are many instances of inaccurate land statistics. By the end of 1988, 316 counties had completed the detailed survey, and the verified arable land area was generally 20% to 30% larger than the original statistics. According to the completed data from Hunan Province, the detailed survey figures were 18% to 94% larger than the 1983 statistics. Even the detailed land survey itself has the risk of data inaccuracies. Some leaders are reluctant to report the survey figures truthfully for fear of increasing agricultural taxes and grain procurement tasks, or fearing that truthful reporting might affect their performance evaluations.

An official from the State Land Administration's Land Registration Bureau said that from the 1988 land annual report analysis, to avoid the levy of arable land occupation tax, the reported statistics for construction land use also have significant discrepancies with the actual situation. It is understood that three provinces and autonomous regions have reported annual construction land use figures that are smaller than the cumulative figures for the first three quarters. During the national statistical summary meeting, some provincial land statistical personnel were hurriedly reducing the figures by one-third according to higher-level instructions.

This official said that the State Council and the State Land Administration have taken a series of measures to ensure the authenticity and reliability of land statistics. Before the completion of the national land detailed survey, land statistics data will not be used as the basis for calculating various burdens. For those who interfere with or obstruct land surveys, and engage in false reporting, concealment, or personal gain in statistical data, they will be dealt with according to party discipline and state laws.

### 各地瞒报耕地情况严重  实际面积大于统计数据

    各地瞒报耕地情况严重
    实际面积大于统计数据
    据新华社北京7月30日电　（中国统计信息报记者李建林、王青萍）据国家土地管理局有关人士透露，我国耕地面积实际上大于目前掌握的数字，各地上报土地统计数据不实是主要原因。
    据了解，目前国家统计局掌握的全国耕地面积为14.36亿亩。但国家土地管理局正在进行的全国土地使用状况调查（土地详查）表明土地统计数字不实情况大量存在。截至1988年底，全国已完成详查的有316个县，查实的耕地面积一般比原统计大20％至30％。据已完成的湖南省资料，详查数比1983年的统计数大18％至94％。就连土地详查本身也有数据失实的危险，一些领导怕增加农业税和粮食征购任务，怕如实上报影响政绩，不愿意上报详查数字。
    国家土地局地籍司负责人说，从1988年的土地年报分析，为了逃避征收耕地占用税，上报的建筑用地统计数字与实际情况也有较大出入。据了解，全国有3个省、区的建设占地年报数比前三季度累计数还小；在全国统计汇总会上，一些省的土地统计人员还在匆忙按上面的指令将数字缩小1／3。
    这位负责人说，国务院和国家土地管理局为保证土地统计数字的真实性和可靠性，已采取一系列措施。在全国土地详查完成以前，土地统计数据不作为核算各种负担的依据。对于干扰、阻挠土地调查，在统计数据上虚报、瞒报和以数谋私的行为，要按党纪国法查处。
