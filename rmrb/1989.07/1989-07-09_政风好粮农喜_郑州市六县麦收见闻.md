Good Government Policies Bring Joy to Farmers – Observations from Wheat Harvest in Six Counties of Zhengzhou

In the fifth year after the summer grain harvest had stagnated for four consecutive years – this year, the counties of Xinzheng, Zhongmou, Xingyang, Mi County, Gong County, Dengfeng, and the six districts of Zhengzhou City in Henan Province achieved a bumper wheat harvest. The total production is expected to increase by more than 20% compared to last year, surpassing the historical highest level. After the farmers harvested and dried the first batch of wheat, they drove tractors, trucks, and carts; mountain farmers pushed wheelbarrows and led donkeys, flocking from all directions to the grain procurement stations. In just half a month, by the end of June, they had completed the procurement tasks.

Farmers who had worked hard for a year and achieved a record-breaking wheat yield could not hide their joy. They spontaneously recited a folk song:

"The weather was good, the government leadership was effective, the double-way contract system was good, and the market was attractive!" Don't underestimate these few words; they reveal the significance of favorable weather, geographical advantages, and harmonious human relations for wheat production.

Starting from June 15th, the grain procurement stations in the six counties of Zhengzhou City became lively. In Pingdi Township of Mi County, the procurement station was filled with the joyful tunes of Henan opera. Farmers completed the procurement tasks in three days. The farmers, with smiles on their faces, received the grain payment and then went to collect the "three-in-one" fertilizers, diesel coupons, and advance payments. The reporter asked a farmer, "Did you not receive any IOUs this year?"

"The county didn't issue any IOUs last year either. This year, the collective levies, agricultural taxes, and various fees were not deducted; we were asked to pay them ourselves. The government's 'three-in-one' policy has been fulfilled, so we willingly pay."

A township official told the reporter that last year, the Zhengzhou Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government, in order to combat drought and sow wheat, stopped the city's electricity. The Party Secretary, Cao Lei, was not at ease and went to Kezhen Township in Gong County to inspect. The township officials reported that there was no electricity for drought relief. Cao Lei went to the fields and asked the farmers if there was electricity for drought relief. The farmers said, "There is, but it was stopped four times in the morning, and we couldn't irrigate!" Cao Lei got angry and called the county leaders: "To combat drought and sow wheat, the city stopped the electricity, but you stopped it!" It was found that the circuit was not connected. Cao Lei said, "Connect it quickly!" The township officials said, "This time, Secretary Cao is serious."

With the wheat harvest, farmers could not contain their joy, and they naturally had more to say. When they summarized the experience of the bumper harvest, they all praised the double-way contract responsibility system.

The double-way contract responsibility system is a refinement and development of the household contract responsibility system by the cadres and farmers of Zhengzhou City. It involves dividing the grain production, procurement tasks, and land area, production, and procurement tasks layer by layer from the county to the township, village, and household, and contracting from the bottom up. While the county, township, and village cadres contract from the top down to supply agricultural materials and provide various production services, and sign contracts, whoever fails to complete the task will be penalized. The reporter heard in Mi County, Gong County, and Xinzheng County that the county government was fined, and the county magistrate paid to buy credibility. At the end of last year, these three counties did not complete the supply of fertilizers to the farmers. The three county magistrates made inspections, apologized, and compensated the farmers. According to the difference between the high-price fertilizers and the low-price fertilizers purchased by the farmers, they issued subsidies: Mi County allocated 83,800 yuan, Gong County allocated 135,000 yuan, and Xinzheng County allocated 90,000 yuan as fines. This incident shocked the farmers in the three counties: "In the past, it was always the government fining the farmers, but now the government fines itself. Such a government, we trust!"

The actions of these three county governments "buying credibility with money" indeed surprised the farmers. Not only did it not lower their authority, but it also won more trust from the farmers. Therefore, when signing the double-way contract for this year, it was completed smoothly from top to bottom.

    政风好粮农喜
    ——郑州市六县麦收见闻
    新华社记者　武成德
    在夏粮连续四年徘徊之后的第五个年头——今年，河南省郑州市新郑、中牟、荥阳、密县、巩县、登封县和6个区，夺取了小麦丰收，预计总产量比去年增加两成以上，超过历史最高水平。广大农民打完晒干头场麦，就开着汽车、拖拉机，拉着架子车；山区农民推着独轮车，赶着小毛驴，从四面八方涌向粮食收购站。仅半个月时间，到6月底就全部完成了定购任务。
    辛苦了一年、使小麦产量突破历史最高水平的农民，掩饰不住内心的喜悦，张口就是一段顺口溜：
  “老天给了好天气，政府领导真得力，双向承包好机制，市场有了吸引力！”别轻看这么几句话，它道出了天时、地利、人和对小麦增产的意义。
    从6月15日起，郑州市六县各粮食收购站热闹起来了。密县平陌乡收购站在欢乐的豫剧乐曲声中，农民三天就完成定购任务。农民笑吟吟地拿着卖粮款，又去取“三挂钩”的化肥、柴油票和预付款。记者问一农民：“今年没有打白条？”
  “俺县去年也没打白条。今年集体提留，农业税和各种款项也没扣，叫俺自己交。政府‘三挂钩’政策都兑现了，俺能不自觉地交？”
    一位乡干部向记者谈到，去年郑州市委、市政府为了抗旱种麦，把城市的电停了。市委书记曹磊不放心，下到巩县芝田乡检查。乡干部反映抗旱没电。曹磊跑到田间问农民，抗旱有没有电？农民说：“有，一上午停了四次，浇不成！”曹磊火了，把县里的头头叫来：“为了抗旱种麦，城里把电压了，你们把电弄哪去了？”经查线路不通。曹磊说：“快快接通！”乡干部说，这回曹书记动真格的了。
    小麦丰收了，农民抑制不住心中的喜悦，农民的话自然也就多起来了。他们总结丰收经验时，都把双向承包责任制赞扬一番。
    双向承包责任制，是郑州市干部、农民对家庭联产承包责任制的完善和发展，即把全县的粮食产量，定购任务，层层分解到乡、村、户，自下而上承包土地面积、产量、定购任务；而县、乡、村干部自上而下承包供应农用物资和提供各种生产服务，并以合同形式定下来，谁完不成罚谁。记者在密县、巩县、新郑县听到县政府受罚、县长掏钱买信誉的新鲜事。去年底，这3个县对农民供应的化肥数量没有完成，三县长向农民作了检查，赔了礼，道了歉。根据农民买高价化肥和平价化肥的差额，发了补贴款：密县拿出8.38万元，巩县拿出13.5万元，新郑县拿出9万元，作为罚款。这件事轰动了三县农民：“从前总是政府罚农民，现在政府自认罚。这样的政府，俺信得过！”
    这三个县政府“掏钱买信誉”的举动，确实出乎农民的意料之外，不仅没有降低威信，反而更加赢得了农民的信赖。所以，在签订今年双向承包合同时，上上下下都很顺当地完成了。
