The Fuzhou New Bookstore in Jiangxi Province is genuinely committed to serving the broad readership and providing quality service. It not only focuses on economic benefits but also emphasizes social benefits.

This large bookstore, responsible for the distribution and sales in 11 counties, always keeps its eyes on finding readers for books and providing quality service. When Nancheng County planted a large number of mandarin oranges, the bookstore immediately sent relevant technical books. During rural markets, they set up stalls with relevant books. When some schools needed to purchase reference books but lacked funds, the bookstore sent the books first and advanced 60,000 yuan on behalf of the schools. During the summer, which is traditionally a slow season for book sales, they opened night markets that operated until 10 PM.

The Fuzhou New Bookstore's emphasis on social benefits and quality service has also led to improved economic performance. Last year, the bookstores in the entire region exceeded their profit plan by 44%, and this year's first half-year also completed the sales and profit plans ahead of schedule, receiving praise from higher authorities.

    对读者负责　为群众服务
    抚州新华书店注重社会效益
    本报讯　记者赵相如报道：江西省抚州地区新华书店诚心实意地对广大读者负责，为广大读者服务，既讲经济效益，更注重社会效益。
    这个负责11个县发行销售的大书店，始终把目光盯在为书找读者和优质服务上边。南城县大量栽培柑桔，他们立即送去有关柑桔方面的科技书籍。农村逢圩遇集，他们带上有关书籍去摆摊设点。有的学校需要添置参考书，一时没有钱，他们先送书去，代学校垫出6万多元钱。夏天历来是购书淡季，他们开设夏夜门市部，营业到22点。
    抚州地区新华书店注重社会效益和优质服务的结果，也使经济效益有了提高。去年全地区书店的利润超计划44％，今年上半年又超额完成销售和利润计划，受到上级的表扬。
