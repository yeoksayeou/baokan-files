Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, July 2nd

Argentina's President-elect Carlos Menem has stated that upon assuming office on July 8th, he will address the country's military issues in accordance with the law.

Menem made this statement on July 1st during a speech in Cordoba Province. Menem emphasized that although he himself had been imprisoned for five years during the military regime, he still hopes for a peaceful society in Argentina. He said, "If people continue to dwell on past grievances, Argentina's future will be bleak."

Since Argentina restored its constitutional government in 1983, the Alfonsín administration had experienced three partial military mutinies. The mutineers demanded that the government halt the trials of military personnel who had committed human rights abuses during the military regime. Although the mutinies were suppressed, the antagonistic sentiment between some military personnel and the government has not been entirely eradicated.

    阿根廷将解决军人问题
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯7月2日电　阿根廷当选总统梅内姆表示，他7月8日就职后，将依法彻底解决国内存在的军人问题。
    梅内姆是7月1日在科尔多瓦省一次讲话中作上述表示的。梅内姆强调说，虽然他本人也曾在军人执政期间被监禁过5年，但他还是希望阿根廷社会恢复安宁。因为，“如果人们继续对过去的恩怨计较不休，阿根廷前途就没有希望”。
    1983年阿根廷恢复宪政后，阿方辛政府曾经历了3次部分军人哗变事件。哗变官兵要求政府停止审判军政府时期曾犯有破坏人权罪的军人。虽然哗变均被平息，但部分军人与政府的对立情绪仍未根除。
