	Severe Repetitive Development in Computer Software
	Leaders of the State Council Emphasize Strengthening Macroeconomic Control

	BEIJING, July 23 (Xinhua) -- It is learned from relevant departments that recently, leaders of the State Council have emphasized the need to strengthen macroeconomic control over the development, circulation, and use of computer software, and to accelerate the process of domestic software production.

	The computer industry in our country is in its infancy, with the total installed capacity already reaching 300,000 units and continuing to increase at a rate of 70,000 units per year. However, the development and circulation of software, which is the "soul" of computers, is in a state of macroeconomic disorder and management chaos. The main manifestations are: irrational division of labor and layout in software development, with serious repetitive development; detachment between research and production, making it difficult to convert developed software achievements into productive forces; a sluggish software market; and the lack of software copyright laws, resulting in no unified regulations in development, management, and use.

	In view of the above phenomena, the China Computer Technology Service Company, the China Software Technology Company, and the Shanghai Microcomputer Application Society, among other units, are, in accordance with the requirements of the State Council, inviting some renowned domestic experts and scholars to review, organize, and summarize the work in the software field in the previous stage. They aim to explore a new path to reverse the chaotic situation.

    计算机软件重复开发严重
    国务院领导强调加强宏观控制
    本报北京7月23日讯　记者刘国胜从有关部门获悉：最近，国务院领导同志强调，要加强对计算机软件开发、流通和使用中的宏观控制，加速软件国产化进程。
    我国计算机事业方兴未艾，现有装机总容量已达30万台，并仍在以每年7万台的速度递增。但是，作为计算机“灵魂”——软件的开发和流通，却存在着宏观失控和管理混乱的局面。其主要表现是：软件开发分工和布局不合理，重复开发现象严重；科研和生产脱离，已开发出的软件成果很难转化成生产力；软件市场萧条；缺少软件版权法，在开发、管理和使用上没有统一法规。
    鉴于上述现象，中国计算机技术服务公司、中国软件技术公司和上海微型电脑应用学会等单位根据国务院的要求，正邀请国内部分著名专家学者对前一阶段软件领域的工作进行一次检验、整理和总结，力争为扭转混乱局面探索出一条新路子。
