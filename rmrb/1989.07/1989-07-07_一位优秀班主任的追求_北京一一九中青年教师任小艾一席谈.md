The young teacher standing before me is almost still a girl, her speech is so fast, and her laughter is so sweet with rosy cheeks. She rides with her students, and it's hard to tell she is their teacher.

She is Ren Xiaoyi, a 31-year-old outstanding young teacher at Beijing No. 119 Middle School, serving as the class advisor and Chinese language teacher for Class 2, Grade 9. She has been teaching for 11 years. She has been awarded the title of Advanced Educator in Beijing twice, Beijing Labor Model, and Beijing Advanced Youth and Children Worker. This year on May 4th Youth Day, she was awarded the title of National New Long March Pioneer and Science and Education New Star by the Communist Youth League Central Committee.

Let Our Education Attract Educators

Interviewer: Currently, some young teachers are not dedicated to their work, and older teachers are worried about having no successors. You not only love your job but have also achieved great results. Please share your thoughts on the teaching profession.

Ren Xiaoyi: We often say, "Let our education attract students." From the perspective of improving education, this is only one aspect of the problem; another aspect is to make our education attractive to educators, which relates to the quality of teachers. Now, many people do not want to be teachers, and those who perform poorly in school go to teacher training colleges. How can those with poor psychological qualities take on the responsibility of educating people? As for making them love their work and dedicate themselves to it, that's even more out of the question. Education urgently needs to turn this vicious cycle into a virtuous one. Some say that teachers' salaries are low, and no one wants to be a teacher. I think that a person's life needs not only material satisfaction but also spiritual fulfillment, needing a full heart.

Interviewer: Now, when teachers gather, they often talk about the impact of societal waves on schools: students are too difficult to teach. In some students, phenomena such as dislike for school, dropping out to do business, early romance, and rebellious attitudes have emerged. Many teachers feel helpless and powerless. You must have encountered these problems, so how do you handle them?

Ren Xiaoyi: As an educator, I think the most important thing right now is to maintain a clear mind and calmly think: do we need to improve our own qualities? If even the "engineers of the human soul" are at a loss in the face of contradictions, how can we enlighten the souls of the new generation? Education is an activity of cultivating people. As the French thinker and educator Rousseau said: "Remember, before daring to take on the task of cultivating a person, one must first cultivate oneself and be a worthy model." Should we blame the students? Think about the education we implement, does it attract the students? Let's consider from the students' perspective: the monotonous and dull school life of two points and a line, the heavy academic burden, the pressure of employment, the tense and disharmonious teacher-student relationship, all of this, how can it not make students develop a dislike for school?

Interviewer: In this regard, I hear you have some new ideas and practices. Please share them specifically.

Ren Xiaoyi: My principle is: "Move their hearts with love, guide their actions with strictness." On the basis of respecting, understanding, and trusting students, I establish a united, democratic, equal, and harmonious new type of teacher-student relationship with students, respecting students' personalities on the basis of treating people equally. In this regard, I have done the "three nos": no reporting during home visits, no asking parents to come to school, and no naming and criticizing students during parent-teacher conferences.

There is a student in the class who has repeated a grade and commits mistakes and does not dare to go home, running to my house at midnight. In his view, as long as the teacher goes to his house, the problem can be solved. I accompanied him back home. The next day, he wrote a diary titled "Midnight Home Visit," in which he wrote: "The teacher accompanied me home at midnight. If I do not correct my mistakes and study hard, I will truly let the teacher down." Later, this student was evaluated as an excellent student. Regarding teachers often asking parents to come, students often think that this is when teachers have no other way but to use the power of parents. Some students say that teachers are like secret police, every day only watching for students' mistakes, then recording them in a small notebook to notify parents. I changed the previous vicious cycle of "teachers ask parents, parents beat children, children hate teachers" into a virtuous cycle of "teachers respect parents, parents understand children, children love teachers."

Cultivating a Good Social Atmosphere for the 21st Century

Interviewer: You are an excellent class advisor. How do you evaluate your class and your students?

Ren Xiaoyi: My goal is to make the class collective a paradise in the hearts of students, with an invisible cohesive force, making students care about the collective, be eager to learn, pursue ideals, and reject bad trends. While cultivating talents needed by society, I also allow students to develop their own personalities and talents. The development of national construction needs talents in all aspects, not just university graduates. Therefore, evaluating a class and the merits and demerits of a teacher cannot be purely based on how many university students are admitted. Every student, after leaving school, can stand firm in society with their own advantages, then our education is successful, and our social appearance will change greatly. In recent years, why is the social atmosphere not very good? I think it is because education has shown a tendency to regress.

Saying that the small climate cannot overcome the big climate is not believing in the social function of education. I think that society is the big climate, schools are the middle climate, and classes are the small climate. If every class is managed well, the social atmosphere will also change. Society is composed of every member, and every member is educated by teachers. If we let things go and cultivate another batch of unqualified citizens, can the country have hope? Therefore, I advocate that teachers should reflect on themselves, find the cause from themselves, start from themselves, and try to cultivate a batch of qualified citizens. Who can influence the social atmosphere of the future country? It depends on us teachers. The members of the 21st-century society are composed of today's students. Only by educating this batch of students well can a good social atmosphere be formed in the future. If every student we cultivate can enter society as an excellent member, then this large organism of society will be healthy.

Interviewer: What qualities should a middle school class advisor have?

Ren Xiaoyi: First, one must love the teaching profession very much. Second, one must have solid professional knowledge and the ability to organize various extracurricular activities. I graduated from No. 119 Middle School in 1978 and later stayed to teach Chinese. Although I have the desire to be a good teacher, I know that my foundation is not enough. I teach during the day and study at night, completing two years of junior college courses. Teachers are the gardeners of education, and class advisors should be even more versatile. I have a wide range of interests and constantly pursue self-improvement. I once participated in three years of swimming training at a sports school, so I dare to take students to Beidaihe to swim. I also participated in the drama team and vocal team organized by the Chaoyang District Cultural Center and performed on stage many times. These qualities are beneficial for me to get close to students and guide students to carry out rich and colorful extracurricular activities. The class I lead is a comprehensive development class, and it is also leading in arts and sports. I strive to shape myself into a class advisor with a broad knowledge base, versatile talents, lively and cheerful, and liked by students, which can also be said to be my pursuit.

Interviewer: After you dedicate all your love to the students, you must have received their respect and affection.

Ren Xiaoyi: When a teacher dedicates all his love to the students, the students' return to the teacher is not something that worldly values can measure, it is a priceless treasure.

Just take my own experience. When my voice became hoarse, the students quietly sent me "throat lozenges." Fearing that I would know who sent them from the handwriting, they wrote with their left hand: "Teacher, hearing your hoarse voice, we feel very sad. Drink all the lozenges, hoping that your clear voice will resonate in the classroom again." When it rains, raincoats and umbrellas will naturally be placed on my desk. One winter, my mother had carbon monoxide poisoning and was rescued. The students heard the news and came to my home to visit, bringing a cassette tape. Everyone recorded their beautiful wishes one by one. Such as "Dear grandmother, you must take good care of yourself, don't let our teacher worry too much. Don't use the stove, buy a heater, electric blanket, hot water bottle, etc.!" Every sentence of deep affection made my mother's eyes well up with tears.

The students' love for me makes me love my work even more. People often use "tomorrow" to describe the future, but "tomorrow" is produced on the basis of "today." After I chose the teaching profession, everything I do is for the future of our motherland.

    一位优秀班主任的追求
    ——北京一一九中青年教师任小艾一席谈
    本报记者　魏玉凤
    站在我面前的几乎还是一位未脱女学生模样的大女孩，说起话来节奏是那么快，笑起来两颊绯红是那么甜。她带着学生一起骑车出去玩，你很难认出她是他们的老师。
    她就是31岁的优秀青年教师任小艾，北京119中学初三（2）班的班主任兼语文教师。算起来她的教龄已经11年了。她曾两次被评为北京市教书育人先进工作者、北京市劳动模范、北京市先进儿童少年工作者等称号。今年“五四”青年节，她被团中央授予全国新长征突击手和科技教育新秀的光荣称号。
    愿我们的教育也能吸引教育者
    记者：目前一些青年教师不安心工作，老教师们担心后继无人。您不仅热爱本职工作，而且作出了成绩，请您谈谈对教师这一工作的看法。
    任小艾：我们常说，“让我们的教育吸引学生”，从办好教育来说，这仅仅是问题的一个方面；另一个方面是应让我们的教育也能吸引教育者，这就关系到教师的素质问题。现在许多人不愿意当教师，一些成绩不好的学生才去考师范。那些心理素质不好的人，怎么能担当得起培养人的工作呢？至于让他们热爱事业并为之献身，就更谈不上了。教育亟待解决的是将这种恶性循环转变成良性循环。有人说，教师待遇低，没人爱当。我认为，一个人活着，不仅仅需要物质上的充实和满足，还需要精神上的，需要有一颗充实的心。
    记者：现在教师们聚在一起时，常常谈到社会的冲击波对学校的影响：学生们太难教了。在一些学生中出现了厌学、弃学经商、早恋、逆反心理等现象。对此，许多老师感到束手无策，无能为力。您肯定也碰到过这些问题，那么您是怎么对待的呢？
    任小艾：作为一名教育工作者，我认为目前最重要的是保持清醒的头脑，冷静地进行思考：我们自身的素质是否需要提高？如果连“人类灵魂的工程师”在矛盾面前都茫然无措，那怎么能去启迪新一代的灵魂？教育是培养人的活动，正像法国思想家、教育家卢梭所说的：“你要记住，在敢于担当培养一个人的任务以前，自己就必须造就一个人，自己就必须是一个值得推崇的模范。”我们该不该埋怨学生？想一想我们所实施的教育是否吸引了学生？让我们站在学生的角度考虑一下：两点一线的枯燥、单调的学校生活，过重的学业负担，升学就业的压力，师生关系的紧张不协调，这一切，怎么可能不使学生产生厌学情绪呢？
    记者：这方面听说您有一些新的观念、新的做法，请您具体谈谈：
    任小艾：我的原则是：“以爱动其心，以严导其行。”在尊重、理解、信任学生的基础上，与学生建立起团结、民主、平等、和谐的朋友式的新型师生关系，在平等待人的基础上，尊重学生的人格。在这方面，我做到了“三不”：家访不告状、不请家长来校、开家长会不点名批评学生。
    班级里有一位留过级的男生，犯了错误就不敢回家，深夜跑到我家里，在他看来，只要老师去他家，问题就可解决，我陪他回了家。第二天他写了一篇“零点家访”的日记，其中写道：“老师深夜陪我回家，我如果再不改正错误，好好学习，真太对不起老师。”后来这位同学被评为三好学生。对于老师动不动就请家长，学生们常常认为这是当老师没有办法了，便动用家长的力量。有的学生说，老师同秘密警察一样，每天只管盯着学生犯了什么错误，然后记在小本本上通知家长。我改变了以往“老师请家长，家长打孩子，孩子恨老师”的恶性循环，成为“老师尊重家长，家长理解孩子，孩子热爱老师”的良性循环。
    塑造21世纪良好的社会风气
    记者：您是一位优秀的班主任，您是如何评价您的班级及您的学生？
    任小艾：我的目标是让班集体成为学生心中的乐园，具有无形的内聚力，使学生产生对集体的关心、对学习的渴望、对理想的追求、对不良思潮的排斥。既注意培养社会所需人才，又允许学生发展自己的个性与特长。国家建设的发展，需要各方面的人才，不都是清一色的大学生。所以评价一个班级，评价一位教师的功过，不能只单纯地看考上了多少个大学生。每一个学生走出校门后都能以自己的优势立足于社会，那我们的教育就是办成功了，我们的社会风貌就会大有改变。这几年为什么社会风气不太好，我认为就是教育出现了倒退的趋势。
    说小气候顶不过大气候，这是不相信教育的社会功能。我觉得，社会是大气候，学校是中气候，班级就是小气候。每一个班都管理好了，社会风气也会变化。社会是由每一个成员构成的，每一个成员又都是从老师那儿教出来的。如果咱们放任自流，再造就一批不合格的公民，那国家能有希望吗？所以我主张，教师要进行自我反思，要从我们自身找原因，要从自身做起，想办法造就出一批合格的公民。谁能影响将来国家的社会风气？要靠我们教师。21世纪的社会成员是由现在的学生构成的，只有把现在这一批学生教育好了，才能形成未来良好的社会风气。如果我们培养的每一个学生都能以优秀一分子进入社会，那么社会这个大机体就是健康的。
    记者：您认为一名中学的班主任应具备什么素质？
    任小艾：首先要十分热爱教师这一职业，其次要有过硬的专业知识及组织各种课外活动的能力。我1978年毕业于119中学，以后留校任语文教师。尽管我具有当好教师的愿望，但深知自己功底不够，我白天当老师，晚上当学生，完成了两年大专班的学业。教师是育人的园丁，班主任尤应多才多艺。我兴趣广泛，并不断追求自我完善。我曾在体校参加过3年游泳训练，因此我敢带学生到北戴河去游泳。我还参加过朝阳区文化馆举办的话剧队、声乐队，并多次登台演出。这些素质就有利于我接近学生，并指导学生开展丰富多彩的课外活动。我带的班是一个全面发展的班，在文艺、体育方面也是领先的。我力图将自己塑造成一个知识面广、多才多艺、活泼开朗、受同学喜欢的班主任形象，这也可以说是我的追求。
    记者：当您把全部爱奉献给学生后，您一定也受到了学生的尊敬与爱戴。
    任小艾：当教师把他全部的爱奉献给学生后，学生回报给教师的不是世俗的价值能够度量的，那是一笔无价的财宝。
    就说我自己的感受吧。我嗓子哑了，学生们悄悄地送上“咽喉冲剂”，怕我从笔迹知道是谁送的，就用左手写上：“老师，听着您那沙哑的声音，我们心里很难过，您把冲剂都喝了，希望您那嘹亮的声音再次回荡在教室里。”下雨了，自然会有雨衣、雨伞放在我桌子上。一年冬天，我母亲煤气中毒，经抢救脱险，学生闻讯后，几十人来到家中慰问，带来了一盘录音带，大家一人一句把自己美好的祝愿录了上去。如“亲爱的奶奶您可千万要多保重，别让我们的老师太费心了。您别生炉子了，买取暖器、电褥子、热水袋吧！”句句深情的话语，听得老母热泪盈眶。
    学生对我的爱使我更加热爱自己的工作。人们常用“明天”来描绘未来，然而，“明天”是在“今天”的基础上产生的。当我选择了教师这个职业后，我所做的一切都是为了祖国的明天。
