The Baoshan Tomb in Jingmen is located on Baoshan Hill in Wangchang Village, Shiliupu Town, Jingmen City, Hubei Province. In late 1986, during the construction of the Jingmen-Shaoyang railway, the tomb was excavated, and a large number of rare Chu artifacts were unearthed.

The Baoshan Tomb mound is hemispherical with a flat top and a diameter of fifty-four meters. The tomb pit is nearly square, with fourteen levels of regular earthen steps from top to bottom. The burial structure consists of one outer coffin and five inner coffins, making it one of the largest Chu tombs in China. According to expert analysis, the tomb was sealed in 292 BC, and the occupant was a male official holding the position of Left Minister, contemporary with Qu Yuan during the reign of King Huai of Chu.

Bamboo Slips: The Baoshan Tomb yielded 444 bamboo slips, of which 282 contain text, totaling approximately 15,000 characters. The content includes three categories: divination and sacrificial records, legal documents, and burial records.

The divination and sacrificial records are divided into more than twenty groups, all of which record the tomb owner's divinations for good fortune and misfortune. The legal documents include records of lawsuits, trade, and wars between Chu and neighboring states. The burial records mainly document the burial items such as carriages, horses, and other artifacts. These provide valuable information for understanding Chu's carriage and horse system, as well as burial and gift-giving practices.

Painted Coffin and Scenic Painting: The exquisite dragon and phoenix painted coffin is the most beautifully decorated and well-preserved lacquered coffin ever discovered. Except for the bottom, all five sides are fully painted. On the lacquered box lid, which is sixty centimeters in circumference and less than five centimeters high, a "Golden Autumn Scenic Painting" is depicted, with vivid images of people, carriages, and horses.

Sword, Spear, and Painted Shield: The bronze spear with a black lacquered shaft has a tip that is a forty-centimeter-long sharp bronze sword. The sword blade is cold and sharp, with an edge that is extraordinarily sharp, clearly a formidable weapon in ancient cavalry battles. What is even more remarkable is that the sword blade also has a scabbard, with the scabbard surface embossed with dragon and phoenix patterns. This is the first time such a discovery has been made in ancient Chinese weapons.

    荆门“包山大墓”
    刘祖信
    楚国古墓——包山大墓位于湖北省荆门市十里铺镇王场村的包山岗上。一九八六年底，荆（门）——沙（市）铁路修建时，对该墓进行了发掘，清理出大量罕见的楚国文物。
    包山大塚封土堆似半球形，顶部圆平，直径五十四米。墓坑近方形，坑壁从上至下呈十四级规则式生土台阶。葬具为一椁五室四重棺，是我国规模较大的楚墓之一。根据专家鉴定，该墓下葬为公元前二九二年，墓主为男性，官居左尹，与屈原同处楚怀王时期。
    竹简。包山大墓共出土楚简四百四十四枚，其中有文字的计二百八十二枚，总字数约一万五千字。内容为卜筮祭祷记录、司法文书、遣策三类。
    卜筮祭祷记录简分为二十余组，其内容皆为墓主占卜吉凶祸福。司法文书简记有狱讼，贸易，楚国与邻国的战争等事。遣策简的主要内容记载随葬的车马器具及其它物品。为我们了解楚国的车马制度及取丧赠物等制度均提供了宝贵的资料。
    彩棺和郊游图。以精美的工艺绘制而成的龙凤彩棺，是迄今出土的纹饰最完美、保存最完好的漆绘彩棺。通体除底面外，其他五面均满幅彩绘。在周长六十厘米，高不足五厘米的漆奁盖圈上描绘了一幅“金秋郊游图”，画面人物、车、马栩栩如生。
    剑矛彩盾。青铜剑形矛为黑色漆杆，矛尖是一柄四十多厘米长的青铜利剑，只见剑身直透寒光，剑尖剑刃锋利异常，大有洞甲削铁之威，在远古的骑战中，定是威震敌胆的攻杀良器。更为特别的是剑身也带剑鞘，鞘面模压而成为龙凤纹图案。这在我国古代兵器中又是首次发现。
