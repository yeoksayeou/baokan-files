	The warships "Chongqing," "Nantong," "Ningbo," "Huangshi," and others, stationed along the vast coastline, have recently received congratulatory messages from their "second hometowns"—the cities after which they are named.

	Since 1986, the Chinese Navy has been naming its large and medium-sized warships after cities, rivers, and mountains in China. The cities take pride in these named warships. Currently, over 50 cities in 22 provinces and autonomous regions have established connections with the named warships. More than 20 cities, including Nanjing, Zunyi, and Wuhu, have passed resolutions through their People's Congress Standing Committees, conferring the title of "Honorary Citizen" on the officers and soldiers of the warships named after their cities. Over 40 cities have had their party and government leaders personally visit the named warships to comfort the sailors. More than 20 cities have designed and made ship emblems for the named warships, expressing the affection of the "hometown" people. Dozens of cities have opened "Named Warship Columns" in their newspapers, regularly reporting on the learning, living, training, and duty situations of the named warship officers and soldiers. Through letter exchanges, mutual visits, and other forms, the cities and warships learn from each other, encourage each other, exchange thoughts, and jointly build and cultivate, achieving good results. The leadership of the Chengdu Red Light Electronic Tube Factory learned that the officers and soldiers of the "Chengdu" warship, returning from a patrol in the South China Sea, had a monotonous cultural life, so they donated several thousand yuan worth of musical instruments. Many cities have provided free training for the military to cultivate dual-purpose talents.

	The named warships regard the cities after which they are named as their "second hometowns" and regularly report their training, learning, and living situations to the cities. The warship units also widely carry out activities such as "Bringing Honor to the Named City" and "Striving to Be Qualified Honorary Citizens."

    架起军民友谊桥梁
   一批军舰以城市命名
    本报北京7月29日讯  “重庆”舰、“南通”舰、“宁波”舰、“黄石”舰等一批驻守在万里海疆的以祖国城市名称命名的军舰，连日来不断收到“第二故乡”——命名城市发来的祝贺节日的电、函。
    自1986年起，海军大中型军舰纷纷以祖国山川、河流、城市名称命名。各城市将命名军舰引为自己的骄傲。目前，已有22个省、区的50多个城市与命名的军舰建立联系。南京、遵义、芜湖等20多个城市的人大常委会通过决议，授予以本市名称命名的军舰官兵为“荣誉市民”；有40多个城市的党政领导亲自到命名舰慰问水兵；有20多个城市为命名舰设计制作了舰徽，表达“故乡”人民的热爱之情；数十个城市的报纸开辟“命名舰专栏”，经常报道命名舰官兵学习、生活、训练、执勤情况。舰市双方通过书信来往、人员互访、顺访“娘家”、定点挂钩等形式，互相学习，互相鼓励，交流思想，共建共育，取得了较好效果。成都红光电子管厂领导了解到从南沙巡逻归来的“成都”舰官兵文化生活较枯燥，便赠送了数千元的乐器。不少城市免费为部队培养两用人才。
    各命名舰把命名城市称为“第二故乡”，定期向城市汇报训练、学习和生活情况。各舰艇部队还普遍开展了“为命名城市增光”、“争当合格荣誉市民”等活动。　（江汝标）
