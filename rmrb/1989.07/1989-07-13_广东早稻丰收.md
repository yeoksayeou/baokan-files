Guangdong has seen a bumper harvest of early rice this year, with an estimated total production of 8.1356 million tons, a 2.5% increase over last year.

Since the beginning of this year, various regions in Guangdong have launched high-yield grain production activities. Leaders at the provincial, municipal, and county levels have all gone down to the fields to address practical issues in agricultural production. By the end of May, the province had delivered 406,800 tons of chemical fertilizer, accounting for 85.2% of the annual pre-sale plan. The province has also promoted the advanced experience of "five unifications" (variety layout, mechanized farming, irrigation and drainage, plant protection, and key measures) from Foshan City. Additionally, the crop planting structure has been adjusted, and the grain planting area has been expanded, making the early rice planting area in the province reach 22.9814 million mu, an increase of 550,400 mu compared to last year.
