The recent turmoil that lasted for several dozen days was a severe test for those of us engaged in ideological and political work in institutions of higher learning. Now that the storm has passed, it is necessary to calm down, reflect deeply, and compare our actions with the insightful speech given by Comrade Deng Xiaoping during his meeting with senior military officers from the capital's martial law troops. It appears that the primary mistake in our ideological and political education over the past few years has been our failure to place the struggle against bourgeois liberalization at the center of our efforts. Objectively speaking, as the Party's 13th Central Committee pointed out, this is naturally related to the overall domestic climate, but from the perspective of our school's work, it is also related to our failure to create a good microclimate within the school. For a long time, we have been facing the infiltration of various bourgeois liberalization ideologies among students, yet our ideological and political work has often been on the sidelines or even powerless. To say that universities have not seriously engaged in ideological and political work would be an injustice to many of our colleagues. Our past efforts in ideological and political work have been tireless, and we have made some reforms in various aspects, which cannot be said to have had no effect. The problem is that we have not focused on this key point (which is also difficult under such a macro environment), and therefore, major problems have arisen. This is precisely a key weakness in our university's ideological and political work.

Today's university students are mostly between 17 and 20 years old. They are eager for knowledge but indiscriminate in their choices; they cannot distinguish between good and bad, yet they are sensitive and active; they read a variety of books and magazines but often do so superficially. In recent years, many books and magazines imported from the West have been translated and published without proper commentary; many information media are mixed with good and bad, and they do not distinguish between right and wrong. As a result, whether in the humanities or sciences, students have been widely influenced by various bourgeois ideas from the West. In the political realm, ideas such as Western democracy, freedom, human rights, and the separation of powers have been particularly fashionable among students. Coupled with the large number of publications and speeches by a few scholars at home that spread bourgeois liberalization thoughts, a cross-infection of macro and micro climates has been formed among students, causing widespread ideological confusion. This situation is naturally susceptible to organization and incitement by those with ulterior motives. Once the conditions are ripe, turmoil and unrest are inevitable, and even bloodshed may be the result. This harsh reality also shows us how fierce and serious the struggle for the next generation is.

Today, as we calmly summarize and reflect, we must start from this reality, grasp the key issues, deepen our understanding, raise our standards, change our thinking, and consciously place the struggle and education against bourgeois liberalization at the center of our overall ideological and political work. Based on this understanding, all ideological and political work in schools, such as Party building, political work team building, improving the political quality of teaching staff, improving and reforming political theory courses, compiling humanities textbooks, reviewing books and magazines, necessary theoretical criticism, work of trade unions, Communist Youth League, and student unions, as well as methods of ideological and political work, should be carefully organized and designed around the center of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. We should adjust our deployments, implement them one by one, and catch up comprehensively. Only in this way can we truly ensure that the school's training objectives are realized in terms of political quality. Now, from the domestic macro climate, under the strong leadership of the Party Central Committee, a good trend and environment for strengthening ideological and political education have emerged, and the school itself should have the confidence to effectively grasp this work.

Specifically, at least the following tasks should be quickly put on the agenda:

1. School leaders must correct the tendency to prioritize talent over virtue in their educational guidelines. In strengthening moral education, they must consciously regard resisting the pollution of bourgeois decadent thoughts as a necessary quality for university students and arrange ideological and political work accordingly. There should be a major transformation in educational policies, teaching content, textbook construction, and teaching methods.

2. Effective measures should be taken to build a strong and dedicated team of political work cadres and theoretical personnel. A certain number of political work cadres and political theory course teachers are indispensable backbone forces for the school's ideological and political work. Their status must be respected, and they must possess comprehensive qualities, including political quality, theoretical literacy, and practical abilities in ideological and political work. They should be good at studying student psychology, understanding social trends, grasping the pulse of thought, and avoiding the shortcomings of simplistic and dogmatic ideological and political work. They should carry out the education of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles in a vivid and profound manner. They should analyze and criticize various erroneous ideas spread by Western bourgeoisie as an important part of political education and theoretical education. They should let students understand the true situation of the Western world and our country's national conditions, clarify the essential differences between bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy, and understand the reasoning behind our country's democratic and legal construction based on its national conditions.

3. Efforts should be made to improve the political quality of teaching staff and enhance their awareness of teaching and educating people, so that they can work together with political work cadres to become an important force in carrying out ideological and political work. This turmoil once received the support of some faculty and staff, and there were more people who sympathized with the students' thoughts. Sometimes, a few wrong words from influential teachers can negate the work of many grassroots political workers. The words of professors with influence have an even greater impact on students. Therefore, the school should clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, first requiring teachers to have a firm stance and clear banner, striving to establish and consolidate the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method. Especially for the cultivation of young teachers, special attention should be paid. Currently, the faculty and staff of Lanzhou University are universally and deeply studying the speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, under the leadership of the Party, raising awareness, unifying thoughts, making preparations, and welcoming the student work after the new semester starts. In the future, teachers should be trained in a planned manner, and daily political theory and Party policies should be organized to continuously improve their political and ideological qualities and their level of opposing bourgeois liberalization, so that they can consciously both teach and educate people. This work is also very difficult and requires perseverance, meticulousness, and many methods.

4. To effectively carry out the education of opposing bourgeois liberalization, the school must clearly criticize various bourgeois liberalization views that are opposed to the Four Cardinal Principles. After the end of the "Cultural Revolution," to avoid repeating the "leftist" errors, no one mentioned class struggle in politics and ideology (although such struggles do exist to a certain extent), and the cultural, educational, and theoretical circles seemed to dare not use the word "criticism." The critical weapons of Marxism seem to have been put away or drowned in the "equal" debates and endless discussions, with the result being the serious spread of bourgeois liberalization thoughts. This should be considered a lesson. I think that Marxism's critical weapons against hostile thoughts must not be abandoned; what should be abandoned is that crude and unreasonable style of argument and the unclear attitude towards the enemy. On this point, the correct attitude should be: while avoiding repeating past "leftist" errors and continuing to adhere to the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, we should, under the precondition of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, dare to raise the banner of Marxist criticism, deeply criticize several representative bourgeois liberalization currents, so that our cadres, teachers, and students can raise their awareness, receive a more profound education, and inherit and develop Marxism in the process of criticism.

    必须抵制资产阶级自由化的侵蚀
    ——分析高校思想政治工作薄弱的一个要害
    兰州大学党委书记　刘众语
    延续数十天的学潮、动乱和暴乱，对于我们在高等学校做思想政治工作的同志真正是一场严酷的考验。现在风波过去，痛定思痛，确需冷静下来，对照邓小平同志接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的精辟讲话，深刻进行反思。
    看起来，这几年高校思想政治教育的主要失误，是在教育中没有把反对资产阶级自由化摆到中心位置。客观地说，正如党的十三届四中全会所指出的，这自然与国内的大气候有关，但从我们学校工作角度来回顾，也与学校没有造成一个良好的小气候有关。长期以来，我们面对着种种资产阶级自由化思潮对学生的侵蚀，思想政治工作却常常处于敲边鼓甚至无能为力的状态。要说高校思想政治工作没有认真去做，高校的许多同志不免感到冤枉。我们过去的思想政治工作辛辛苦苦，若干方面还有所改革，不能说没有效果，问题是由于没有着力抓住这个主要之点（自然在那种大环境下也难），因此，才出了大问题。这正是我们高校思想政治工作薄弱的一个要害。
    现在的大学生小的十七八岁，大的二十岁出头。他们渴望知识，又饥不择食；他们良莠不分，又敏感好动；他们阅读的书刊很杂，而又生吞活剥。这些年来，从西方引进的许多书刊又不加评论地大量翻译出版；好多信息媒介鱼龙混杂，而又是非不分。这样，无论文科还是理科的学生，都比较普遍地受到西方形形色色的资产阶级思想的影响。从政治领域说，特别像西方的民主、自由、人权、三权分立等思想，在学生中一直相当时髦。加上少数学者在国内大量出版的散布资产阶级自由化思想的著述和言论，在学生中就形成了大气候和小气候的交叉感染，造成了弥漫性的思想混乱。这种状况，自然是经不起一些别有用心的人的组织和挑动的。只要火候一到，学潮和动乱势必不可避免，甚至包括被迫付出血的代价。这个严酷事实同时还使我们看到，争夺接班人的斗争是多么激烈和严重。
    我们今天来冷静地总结回顾，就要从这个实际出发，抓住要害，加深认识，提高境界，转变思想，真正自觉地把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争和教育摆到整个思想政治工作的中心位置。据此认识，今后学校各种思想性政治性的工作，如党的建设、政工队伍的建设、任课教师政治素质的提高、政治理论课教学的提高和改进、文科教材的编写、书刊评论、必要的理论批判，工会、共青团和学生会的工作，以及思想政治工作方法等等，都要围绕坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化这个中心，精心组织设计，调整部署，逐个落实，全面赶上来。这样，才能真正保证学校的培养目标从政治素质上落到实处。现在，从国内大气候看，在党中央的坚强领导下，已经出现了加强思想政治教育的极好苗头和环境，学校自身就更应当有信心切实把这项工作抓好。
    具体说来，至少有以下几项工作，应当迅速提到日程上来：
    一、学校领导在办学指导思想上，一定要扭转重才轻德的偏向。在加强德育教育中，自觉地把抵制资产阶级腐朽思想的污染当做大学生必须具备的素质，来安排思想政治工作。要在教育方针、教学内容、教材建设、教学方法上都来一个大转变。
    二、要采取得力措施，精心建设一支又红又专的精干的政工干部队伍和理论队伍。一定数量的政工队伍和政治理论课教师是学校思想政治工作的不可或缺的骨干力量。他们的地位必须受到尊重，同时他们应当具备比较全面的素质，包括政治素质、理论素养和做思想政治工作的实际能力。他们应当善于研究学生心理，了解社会思潮，掌握思想脉搏，注意克服思想政治工作中存在的简单生硬、肤浅教条的毛病，把坚持四项基本原则的教育生动深刻地开展起来。要把分析批判西方资产阶级散布的种种错误观念作为讲授政治课的重要内容，有的放矢地进行政治教育和理论教育。要让同学们了解西方世界的真实情况和我国的国情，搞清资产阶级民主和无产阶级民主的本质区别，弄清我国民主和法制建设必须从中国国情出发的道理。
    三、要切实努力改善授课教师的政治素质，提高他们教书育人的自觉性，使他们和政工干部一起成为开展思想政治工作的重要力量。这次学潮曾一度得到一些教职员的支持，在思想上同情学生的要更多些。有时有影响的教师的几句错话，可以抵销基层政工人员的许多工作。有威望的教授的话，在学生中影响更大。所以要在学校旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，首先要求教师们要立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，力争树立和巩固马克思主义的立场、观点和方法。特别是对青年教师的培养要给予特殊的关注。现在兰州大学的教职工正在普遍、深入地学习邓小平同志的讲话和党的十三届四中全会精神，正在党的领导下，提高认识，统一思想，做好准备，迎接下学期开学后的学生工作。以后还要有计划地培训教师，组织好日常的政治理论和党的方针政策的学习，不断提高他们的政治思想素质和反对资产阶级自由化的思想水平，使他们大多能够做到比较自觉地既教书、又育人。这个工作难度也是很大的，需要坚持不懈，精雕细刻，多想办法。
    四、学校要卓有成效地开展反对资产阶级自由化的教育，还必须旗帜鲜明地批判与四项基本原则相对立的形形色色资产阶级自由化观点。“文化大革命”结束以后，为了避免重犯“左”的错误，大家都不提政治上、思想上的阶级斗争了（而这种斗争事实上在一定范围内是存在的），文化界、教育界、理论界似乎也不敢用“批判”二字了。马克思主义的批判武器似乎被收藏了起来，或者淹没在“平等”的争鸣和无穷的商榷之中，其结果却是资产阶级自由化思潮的严重泛滥。这应该说也是一个教训。我觉得，马克思主义对于敌对思想的批判武器是绝对不能丢的，丢掉的只应是那种立论简单粗暴、不讲道理的学风和敌我界限不清的态度。在这一点上，正确的态度应当是：既要避免重犯过去“左”的错误，继续坚持“双百”方针，又要在坚持四项基本原则的总前提下，敢于高举马克思主义批判的旗帜，深刻批判资产阶级自由化若干代表性思潮，使我们的干部、教师、学生提高觉悟，受到比较深刻的教育，并在批判中继承和发展马克思主义。
