A novel type of watch has attracted many consumers to eagerly purchase it. Not only can it clearly display the time at a glance, but it also allows one to interestingly observe the movement of various internal components.

This is the latest product from the Shanghai Watch Factory—the fully transparent hollow mechanical watch.

Its unique feature is that the back cover is made of clear, transparent organic glass; the various beautiful time symbols on the dial are embedded in a ring shape, with the center of the dial completely hollowed out.
