    Praising the Hongdong Well-Drilling Team

    Our county is located in southern Shanxi Province, with over 900,000 mu of arable land, experiencing droughts nine out of ten years. To improve agricultural production conditions, the county's well-drilling team of over 80 people, regardless of wind or rain, has been fighting on the front lines of agricultural production year-round.

    To drill more wells and irrigate the fields effectively, they have worked to reduce the cost of drilling. Previously, this team used cast iron pipes for drilling, costing 130 yuan per meter. Many villages with poor economic conditions could not afford to drill wells. To solve this problem, in October 1986, they invested 500,000 yuan to establish a cement pipe workshop with an annual production capacity of 10,000 meters, replacing cast iron pipes with cement pipes. The cement pipes they produce are of high quality and low cost, with a selling price of only 17 yuan per meter, significantly reducing the cost of drilling wells. Currently, for every meter of well they drill, they charge 5 yuan less than the provincial regulation.

    They have used every means to shorten the construction period. Previously, drilling a well required 30 to 50 days. Now, this well-drilling team, through comprehensive quality management and improvement of mechanical equipment, has increased efficiency. Generally, they can complete drilling a well in just 3 to 5 days.

    In the past, the well-drilling team only drilled wells and did not handle the follow-up work. Many villages, although the wells were drilled, could not use the water for a long time and could not irrigate the fields. Now, the well-drilling team ensures that for every well they drill, they carefully handle the follow-up service work, allowing the drilled wells to be put into use immediately.

    In the past two years, the Hongdong well-drilling team has drilled 177 wells, repaired over 100 abandoned wells, and improved and expanded the irrigation of nearly 400,000 mu of arable land, saving farmers over 800,000 yuan in drilling costs.

    夸夸洪洞打井队
    我县地处山西南部，共有耕地面积90多万亩，十年九旱。为了改善农业生产条件，县打井队80多人不管刮风下雨，常年战斗在农业生产第一线。
    为了多打井，灌溉好田地，他们努力降低打井成本。这个队过去打井，都用铸铁管，每米需花费130元。不少经济条件差的村打不起井。为了解决这个问题，1986年10月，他们投资5万元，建成了一个年产万米的水泥管车间，用水泥管代替铸铁管。他们生产的水泥管质高价廉，每米售价只有17元，大大降低了打井成本。目前，他们每打1米井，要比省里规定的少收5元。
    他们千方百计缩短工期。过去打一眼井，需要三五十天。现在，这个打井队通过全面质量管理，改进机械设备，提高了效率，一般用三五天就可打成一眼井。
    以前，打井队只管打井，不管配套。不少村庄的井虽然打成了，却长期用不上水，浇不了田。现在，打井队每打一眼井，就认真做好配套服务工作，让打好的井立即投入使用。
    近两年来，洪洞打井队共打井177眼，修复废井100多眼，改善、扩浇了近4万亩耕地，为农民节省了打井费用80多万元。
