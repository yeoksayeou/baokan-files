The bus is calling

In today's severe public security situation, this small space of the "public bus" is filled with urgent social security problems that need to be solved. According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments in a certain city in northern Henan, in 1988 alone, there were over a hundred cases of theft and robbery on city buses, and more than 90 incidents of bus drivers and conductors being insulted and beaten.

When incidents occur on the bus, some passengers blame the bus drivers and conductors: the drivers and conductors only care about making money, but we pay to ride the bus and have no safety guarantee. They turn a blind eye to the thugs on the bus, which is truly negligent.

The bus drivers and conductors are also full of complaints: with dozens of people on the bus, no one dares to step forward, and we have to pass through here every day. Who can we afford to offend? Moreover, who is responsible for our personal safety?

They can easily give examples of this: Old driver Duan, with over 30 years of service, is a kind and honest person who works hard and has been recognized as an advanced worker by the company for many years. Once, because he stopped a thug's illegal behavior on the bus, he was beaten into a concussion and had several ribs broken. The thug only paid a thousand yuan in medical expenses and the case was closed.

From this, public transportation workers lament that our legal system is not perfect. This phenomenon of having laws but not enforcing them, and enforcing them but not strictly, cannot be said to be an important reason for the rampant behavior of thugs.

If we blame the public security organs for this, it seems unfair. In recent years, the contradiction between heavy tasks and insufficient police force has become increasingly prominent. Public buses are highly mobile, have long lines, and public security work is very difficult. In most cases, after an incident occurs, not only do the public not actively hand over the criminal to the public security organs, but even after the public security organs have gone to great lengths to catch the criminal, many people are often unwilling to testify, fearing that it will bring trouble to themselves. This undoubtedly makes the handling of the case difficult. Pickpocketing on public buses is a prominent problem. Thieves in groups of three or five blend in with the passengers, openly stealing and creating panic. When the police get on the bus, the thieves disappear; as soon as the police leave, they get back on the bus. If concentrated efforts are made to crack down on them, they will be subdued for a while; if the pressure is relaxed, they will become rampant again. Even if they are caught, at most they can only be detained, fined, or sent to labor camps. Once they are out, they will return to their old ways.

From the perspective of the entire social mechanism, although we have vigorously promoted heroes of righteousness, our society lacks the necessary legal mechanisms to promote righteousness. As a result, some heroes of righteousness and their families fall into various unfortunate predicaments. Here is an example. Once, coal miner Li was taking a public bus home when he saw a thief stealing a passenger's wallet. He pointed out the thief, but was attacked by the other three accomplices, who beat him up and stabbed him several times with a knife before fleeing. After Li was injured, instead of receiving the due honor, the mine deducted all his bonuses because the public security bureau did not solve the case and the case was still unresolved. The physical pain made Li toss and turn, and the spiritual blow made his heart bleed.

Why do incidents keep happening on public buses, and why do thugs dare to act in broad daylight?

On the 100 million kilometers of roads across the country, tens of millions of public buses roll on. They leave people with a series of sighs, rows of thoughts, and a series of calls...

### 公共汽车在呼唤

    公共汽车在呼唤
    在社会治安形势严峻的今天，“公共汽车”这块小小的空间满贮着亟待解决的社会治安问题。据豫北某市有关部门不完全统计，1988年仅发生在市区公共汽车内的盗窃、抢劫案就达百余起，司乘人员被辱骂殴打90余人次。
    案件发生在公共汽车上，一些乘客便埋怨起司乘人员来：司机、售票员只管挣钱，我们掏钱乘车却无安全保障。他们对车上的歹徒熟视无睹，实在是失职。
    司乘人员更是牢骚满腹：车里几十口大活人谁都不敢上前，我们每天跑车得路过这里，惹得起谁呢？况且我们的人身安全又由谁来管？
    这方面的例子他们可以随口举出：有30多年工龄的老司机段师傅，为人忠厚老实，工作踏实勤恳，历年被单位评为先进工作者，一次因制止上车歹徒的不法行为，被打成脑震荡，肋骨被踢断好几根。歹徒只赔偿千余元医疗费便结了案。
    由此，公交职工感叹我们的法制不健全。这种有法不依，执法不严的现象不能说不是歹徒横行无忌的一个重要原因。
    如果就此去一味责怪公安机关，似乎也失于公允。近年来，任务重，警力不足的矛盾日益突出。公共汽车流动性强，战线长，治安工作非常难做。多数情况是，发生案件之后，不要说群众主动将罪犯扭送公安部门了，就是公安部门费尽艰辛将罪犯抓获后，取证时许多人往往不愿作证，生怕给自己带来麻烦，这无疑给处理工作造成困难。在公共汽车上扒窃是比较突出的问题。窃贼三五成群混入乘客之中，明抢暗偷，闹得人心惶惶。公安人员一上车，窃贼匿迹；警察前脚走，他们后脚又上了车。集中力量打击一下，他们会收敛一下；稍松一松便再度猖獗。就是抓到了，充其量只能拘留、罚款、劳教，出来后他们便“重操旧业”。
    就整个社会机制来看，虽然我们也曾大张旗鼓地宣扬过见义勇为的英雄人物，但是，我们的社会却缺乏弘扬正气的必要法律机制。结果，使一些见义勇为者以及他们的亲人陷入种种不幸的窘境之中。这里有一例证。一次，煤矿工人李某乘公共汽车回家，途中发现一窃贼正在偷一乘客的钱包，他上前指责窃贼时，遭其他3名同伙的疯狂报复，他们对李大打出手，并凶狠地用匕首连刺李数刀，尔后扬长而去。李受伤后，非但没有得到应有的荣誉，因不能上班，矿上还扣发了他的全部奖金。理由是公安机关没有破案，案件尚无结论。皮肉的伤痛使李某辗转反侧，精神上的打击更使他的心在滴血。
    为什么公共汽车上案件不断，众目睽睽之下歹徒竟能逞凶？
    在全国100万公里的公路上，数十万辆公共汽车车轮滚滚。它留给人们一串串感叹，一行行思索，一声声呼唤……
