    Marriage Registration Without Proof: A 16-Year-Old Girl as a Bride

    On the morning of April 12, a girl under the age of 16 from our village hurried to the village committee of Wanquanshi in Fengtai District, presenting a marriage certificate stamped with the official seal of the Marriage Registration Office of Anping County, Hebei Province. She requested a letter of introduction to transfer her household registration. The officials were taken aback: everyone in the village knew that this girl was not yet 16 years old. The girl's work unit had not issued a marriage registration letter, so how did she obtain a "legal" marriage certificate? This girl was born on April 13, 1973, but the certificate listed her birthdate as February 1, 1968.

    结婚登记不要证明十六岁少女当新娘
    四月十二日上午，我乡一不满十六岁的姑娘匆匆来到丰台区万泉寺村村公所，掏出了盖有河北安平县人民政府婚姻登记专用章的结婚证书，要求开介绍信迁户口。干部们不禁一楞：村里人都知道，这个姑娘还不满十六周岁。女方单位没开过婚姻登记介绍信，她是怎么获得“合法”的结婚证书的呢？这位姑娘本是一九七三年四月十三日出生，但结婚证上填的竟是一九六八年二月一日出生。
