From afar, I gaze at you, at your contemplative eyes. My heart is also silent. I dare not disturb you, fearing that I might awaken your sweet dreams.

Leaning against a tree, lost in thought, I can do it, I can stand as still as a tree. Believe me, please believe me, even if you leave one day without saying a word of farewell, I understand, I understand your heart.

To rest in the embrace of the mountains is a pursuit, to be still under the green shade of young trees is a pursuit. To hold hands with the blue sky in the deep mountains is not a pursuit? To cuddle with the grass at the horizon is not a pursuit?

In my lonely heart, hatred will not grow. Your pure and blue beauty will not arouse my jealousy. Believe me, please believe me. For your stunning beauty that shocks the world, I will only bless you. For your fresh and yearning spirit, I will only bless you.

From afar, I gaze at you, at your contemplative eyes. My heart is also silent.

In the Altai Primitive Forest

In a place where few people tread, I heard the clamor again, the clamor of a stadium; I smelled the gunpowder again, the gunpowder of an ancient battlefield.

What has passed remains cherished in my heart, but what should be mine is slow to reveal itself.

Entwined vines cannot stop the branches from reaching for the sunlight; dense layers of leaves cannot block the young shoots from drinking the dew.

Every sturdy tree is striving to display its new leaves; every fragile life is struggling to play the symphony of youth.

The sunlight, too, is moved by this passionate invitation, casting golden rays across the sky and earth.

In a place where few people tread, I saw the competition again, a fierce competition that unfolds silently. To obtain every inch of sunlight, the lives here choose only one way of survival—

Stand tall, reach up, upward.

    静静向你走来
    筱园
    新疆喀纳斯湖
    远远的，我望着你，望着你沉思的明眸。我的心，也在沉默。我不忍打扰，生怕惊醒了你甜美的梦。
    倚树而立，神思天外，我会的，我会站成一棵树的。相信我，请相信我，纵然你走的那一天，没有向我道一声珍重，我理解，理解你的心。
    安卧在山峦的怀抱里，也是一种追求，静化在幼林的绿荫下，也是一种追求。和蓝天相握在深山，不也是一种追求？和小草依偎在天边，不也是一种追求？
    我孤独的心中不会生长仇恨，你碧蓝纯净的美，不会引起我的嫉妒，相信，请相信我。为你惊世骇俗的俏丽，我只会祝福，为你清新欲滴的神往，我只会祝福。
    远远的，我望着你，望着你沉思的明眸，我的心，也在沉默。
    阿尔泰原始森林
    在罕无人迹的地方，我又听到了喧嚣，一种竞技场中的喧嚣；又闻到了硝烟，一种古战场上的硝烟。
    已逝去的依然在我心中珍存，该得到的却迟迟不肯露出芳容。
    千缠百绕的藤萝无法阻止向上伸去的枝蔓寻找阳光；密密层层的枝叶无法阻挡破土萌生的幼芽畅饮甘露。
    每一棵茁壮的树木都在竭力展示新生的绿叶；每一个弱小的生命都在拚力奏响青春的乐章。
    阳光也被这热情的相邀感动了，在天地间洒片片金光。
    在罕无人迹的地方，我又看到了竞争，一种无声无息中展开的激烈的竞争。为了得到每一寸阳光，这里的生命都只选择一种生存方式——
    高高地挺立，向上，向上。
