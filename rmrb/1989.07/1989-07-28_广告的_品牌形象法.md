Advertising contains profound cultural and artistic elements, and its methods of expression are numerous. The "brand image method" is one of them.

In the early days, products from various countries did not have brand names or logos. Therefore, wholesalers could control manufacturers to produce any kind of product, dominating the market flow of goods. Later, some manufacturers wanted to distinguish their products from competitors, and thus the product logo—the brand—appeared. A brand refers to the personality of a product composed of its name, packaging, price, texture, color, and advertising form. The famous British advertising master David Ogilvy believed: "Every product is a long-term investment in a comprehensive understanding of its brand image."

Ogilvy himself designed many advertisements that could establish a brand image. For example, the well-known "Marlboro" cigarette advertisement showcased the rugged, masculine image of a man, attracting many male customers. He also designed a unique advertisement for Shadwell shirts. In the advertisement, a male actor wearing a Shadwell shirt with an eye patch over his right eye left a deep impression on viewers. Once a product establishes a distinct and unique image, becoming a well-known brand in people's minds, it will bring long-term benefits to the enterprise.

Experts who study consumer behavior believe that people's needs arise from physiological and psychological motives. However, interests generated on the basis of psychological needs are more enduring. Consumers will not lose interest or have their interest fade away due to some satisfaction in the consumption process. On the contrary, it can generate a stronger and more intense interest. The brand image method precisely utilizes this regularity. In advertisements, it uses deeply moving images, language (and music) to repeatedly influence consumers, creating a strong impression of a certain brand, making them desire to purchase it for a long time.

Today, the masterpieces produced by the brand image method have reached a socially recognized high artistic level. People can call Coca-Cola advertisements masterpieces of photography, or they can call them excellent works of advertising creativity. Brand image advertising was born with the emergence of commodity economy and, in turn, has injected strong vitality into increasing the cultural and artistic qualities of advertising.

    广告的“品牌形象法”
    黄宇翔
    广告包含深刻的文化和艺术，其表现手法很多，“品牌形象法”就是其中之一。
    早年，世界各国的产品并无牌号、标志。因此，批发商可以操纵厂商生产任何一种产品，控制了市场货物流通。后来，有些厂商想使自己的产品与竞争者的产品区分开来，产品的标志——品牌就出现了。所谓品牌就是指每一商品的名称、包装、价格、质地、色彩、广告形式等组成的商品个性。英国著名广告大师戴维·奥格威认为：“每个产品都是对它的品牌形象全面认识的长期投资。”
    奥格威自己就设计了不少能够树立品牌形象的最佳广告。像众人皆知的“万宝路”香烟广告，向人们展示了男子汉那粗犷、豪放的形象，吸引了许许多多男性顾客。他还为夏达威衬衫做了独特的设计。在广告中，一位男演员身穿夏达威条衫，右眼套只护眼罩，给人深刻的印象。产品一旦建立鲜明独特的形象，成为人们心中的名牌，就会为企业带来长期的效益。
    研究消费者行为的专家们认为：人们的需要产生于生理性和心理性动机。而在心理性需要基础上产生的兴趣比较持久，消费者在消费过程中不会因为某种满足而导致兴趣的减弱与消失。相反，还可以产生更强烈、更浓厚的兴趣。品牌形象法正是利用了这种规律性。在广告中采用感人至深的画面、语言
  （还有音乐），去反复感染消费者，以造成对某种品牌的强烈印象，使他们产生长期购买的欲望。
    今天，品牌形象法产生的佳作已经达到了社会公认的高艺术水准。人们可以称可口可乐等广告是摄影的杰作，也可称之为广告创意的佳品。品牌形象广告随着商品经济的产生而产生，又为增加广告的文化、艺术性注入了强有力的生命。
