The chairman of the South Commission, Julius Nyerere, sent a letter on July 12 to the leaders of the seven major Western countries, urging them to hold a joint meeting with the leaders of the heavily indebted third-world countries. The aim is to make a political decision to stop the flow of capital from the third world to developed countries.

Nyerere stated in the letter that in 1988, 17 of the most heavily indebted countries had a net outflow of $31 billion to their creditors.

Nyerere appealed to the leaders of the seven countries to give "the most urgent and sincere consideration" to the issue of unjustified capital flows from poor countries to rich countries, and to the ineffectiveness of economic growth and development in debtor countries as a result.

The leaders of the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Japan, Canada, and Italy will hold their 15th summit meeting in Paris on July 14.

    尼雷尔致函西方七国首脑
    呼吁制止资金倒流
    新华社日内瓦7月12日电  总部设在日内瓦的南方委员会主席朱利叶斯·尼雷尔12日致函西方七大国领导人，呼吁他们与第三世界债务国领导人举行一次联席会议，为制止资金从第三世界流失到发达国家作出一项政治决定。
    尼雷尔在信中说，1988年，17个负债最多的债务国净流向其债权人的资金就达310亿美元。
    尼雷尔呼吁七国领导人对由贫国向富国不公正的资金倒流以及债务国的经济增长和发展因此而变得无效的问题给予“最迫切而最诚挚的考虑”。
    美国、英国、法国、西德、日本、加拿大和意大利等七国领导人将于14日在巴黎举行第十五届七国首脑会议。
