	Henan Deals Firmly with Violators of Tobacco Leaf Procurement Regulations to Prevent a Repeat of the "Tobacco Leaf War"
	Shoot the First Bird to Prevent the "Tobacco Leaf War" from Happening Again
	Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 22nd – Reporter Li Erliang reports: The golden tobacco leaves are ripe across the central plains of Henan in July. In a recent provincial telephone conference on tobacco leaf procurement, Henan strictly dealt with the leaders and procurement personnel of three counties who violated regulations, to prevent the recurring "tobacco leaf war."

	At the beginning of this spring, the Henan provincial government took strict measures to rectify the order of tobacco leaf procurement. Since the procurement scales were opened on July 15th, the vast majority of places have strictly implemented national policies, procured according to contracts, and strictly controlled the quality, with a qualified rate of over 80%, effectively curbing the outbreak of the "war." However, there are still a few places that, for local interests, disregarded the overall situation and disrupted the procurement order. Among them, Xuchang County, Weishi County, and Xinzheng County were particularly prominent. They either did not procure according to the contract, or even did not sign a contract with the tobacco farmers at all, and arbitrarily procured tobacco leaves from other places; or they raised the procurement price and lowered the procurement grade standards, resulting in poor quality of the procured tobacco leaves, with some having a qualified rate of only 4%.

	For these blatant violators, the relevant provincial departments immediately took serious measures. The managers and deputy managers of the tobacco companies in Xuchang County and Weishi County were demoted, given serious demerits, and reprimands; the station heads directly responsible for the problems in the three counties' tobacco leaf procurement stations were removed from their posts; the weighers were suspended from work, and each was fined 100 yuan; the tobacco tax for procuring tobacco leaves from other places was fully recovered, and a double fine was imposed. The heads of the tobacco departments in the cities and counties to which the three counties belong were ordered to reflect.

    河南处理烟叶收购违纪者毫不含糊
    防止“烟叶大战”重演  就是要“枪打出头鸟”
    本报郑州7月22日电　记者李而亮报道：7月的中原大地，烟叶泛金，丰收旺季已临。河南省在日前的全省烟叶收购电话会议上，严肃处理了违章收购的3个县的有关领导和收购人员，以防止屡禁不止的“烟叶大战”重演。
    今春伊始，河南省政府就狠抓整顿烟叶收购秩序的工作。7月15日烟叶收购开秤以来，绝大多数地方认真执行国家政策，按合同收购，严把质量关，收购等级合格率达80％以上，抑制了“大战”的发生。但仍有少数地方，为了地方利益，不顾大局，破坏收购秩序。其中比较突出的是许昌县、尉氏县、新郑县。他们或是不按合同收购，甚至根本就没跟烟农签订合同，擅自收购外地烟叶；或是提高收购价格、降低收购等级标准，使收购的烟叶质量低劣，有的合格率仅有4％。
    对这些公然违纪的“出头鸟”，省有关部门立即进行了严肃处理。许昌县、尉氏县烟草公司经理、副经理分别受到了撤职、行政记大过、记过的处分；上述3个县直接出现问题的烟叶收购站长都被撤销了职务；司磅人员被停止工作，每人罚款100元；收购外地烟叶多得的烟叶税除全部收回外，还处以两倍的罚款。三个县所属地市烟草部门负责人被责令检讨。
