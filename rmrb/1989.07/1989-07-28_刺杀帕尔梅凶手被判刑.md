Our correspondent in Stockholm, Guo Yaoming, reports: The Stockholm District Court today ruled that Christer Pettersson is the murderer of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, sentencing him to life imprisonment.

During the trial, 33 witnesses, including Palme's widow, testified. The prosecutor, based on the testimony of most witnesses, accused the 42-year-old unemployed Swede, Christer Pettersson, of murdering Palme. On the evening of February 28, 1986, while waiting for a drug dealer outside the Grand Cinema in Stockholm, he saw Palme and his wife entering the cinema. He then retrieved a handgun from the drug dealer's residence. As the movie ended, he followed Palme and his wife, shooting and killing Palme.

According to reports, the court was divided on the verdict that Pettersson is the murderer of Palme. Two judges believed there was no physical evidence and no eyewitnesses at the scene. Six jurors, based on the testimonies, especially that of Palme's wife, concluded that Pettersson could be convicted as the murderer. The verdict was passed by a majority vote.

After the court's decision, the defendant immediately appealed.

    刺杀帕尔梅凶手被判刑
    本报斯德哥尔摩7月27日电　记者顾耀铭报道：瑞典斯德哥尔摩地方法院今天裁决彼特松为刺杀瑞典前首相帕尔梅的凶手，被判处终身监禁。
    在审讯过程中共有包括帕尔梅遗孀在内的33名证人出庭作证。检察官根据大多数证人的证词指控42岁的瑞典失业男子克里斯特·彼特松是刺杀帕尔梅的凶手。1986年2月28日晚，他在斯德哥尔摩格兰德电影院外面等候一名毒品贩子时，看到帕尔梅夫妇走进了电影院。他随即从那名毒品贩子住处拿到一支手枪。在电影院散场时，他尾随帕尔梅夫妇，开枪打死帕尔梅。
    据报道，法庭对判处彼特松为刺杀帕尔梅的凶手意见不一致。两名法官认为，没有物证，也没有现场目击者作人证。6名陪审员依据证词特别是帕尔梅夫人的作证，认为可以判决彼特松为凶手，结果以多数通过裁决。
    在法庭作出裁决后，被告不服，立即提出上诉。
