	Industrial and Commercial Bank Sees Significant Deposit Growth
	Half-Year Increase Hits Record High

	BEIJING, July 25 (Xinhua) -- Reporter Shi Mingshen reports: In the first half of this year, the Industrial and Commercial Bank introduced new savings products such as value-preserving savings, salary disbursement, housing savings, and deposits for individual businesses. Additionally, starting from February 1, the bank raised deposit interest rates. These measures led to a significant increase in savings deposits, with the bank recording an increase of 25.8 billion yuan from January to June. This is 9.8 billion yuan more than the same period last year, marking a 61% increase. The increase in deposits surpassed the total for the entire previous year, setting a new record high.

	In accordance with the national policy of tightening monetary policy, the Industrial and Commercial Bank has strictly controlled the scale of credit and tightened loan issuance. In the first half of the year, loans increased by 11.6 billion yuan, staying within the national approved credit scale, and the allocation of funds was also relatively reasonable.

    工商银行存款增幅大
    上半年增加额为历年最高
    本报北京7月25日讯　记者施明慎报道：今年上半年，工商银行开办保值储蓄、代发工资、住房储蓄、个体户存款等新储种，加之从2月1日起提高了存款利率，使该行1至6月储蓄存款增加258亿元，比去年同期多增98亿元，增幅达61％。增加额超过去年全年水平，为历年最高。
    根据国家抽紧银根的方针，工商银行严格控制信贷规模，从紧发放贷款。上半年贷款增加116亿元，控制在国家核定的信贷规模之内，并且资金投向也比较合理。
