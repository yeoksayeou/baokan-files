The Associated Press published a news analysis on June 19, examining the reasons behind the Conservative Party's defeat in the European Parliament elections:

Mrs. Thatcher has been fighting for a decade to eliminate strikes, inflation, and high-interest rates, but these economic ills are once again plaguing Britain. Now, her Conservative Party has suffered a defeat in the European Parliament elections.

The opposition Labour Party, which won its first nationwide victory since 1974, is jubilant. In the 78 constituencies in the UK, the Labour Party won 45 seats, while the Conservatives secured 32, reversing the results of the 1984 European Parliament elections, where the Conservatives led with 45 to 32.

To increase its appeal, the Labour Party has modified some of its left-wing policies. The party's foreign policy chief, Gerald Kaufman, said, "Since the beginning of this year, we have been making continuous progress."

Former Prime Minister Heath, a critic of Mrs. Thatcher within the Conservative Party, believes she is in serious trouble. He said, "If after ten years in power, nearly two million people are still unemployed, there is a trade deficit of 15 billion pounds (equivalent to 23 billion dollars), interest rates are at 14%, and inflation is at 8% and rising, the people will definitely say... is this what we want to see?"

Energy Minister Parkinson said, "We admit all of this. We do not deny that inflation is a major problem. We are trying to solve it."

It is generally believed that the inflation problem is a result of the success of Thatcherism in restoring the economy through measures such as tax cuts, reduced government intervention, the sale of nationalized enterprises, the abolition of foreign exchange controls, and the restriction of trade union rights.

The result is a nationwide consumption boom, a sharp increase in the trade deficit, demands for larger wage increases, and higher interest rates.

The spiral of wages and inflation is a terrifying prospect for any government. However, for Mrs. Thatcher's plans, there are even more troubles ahead. These plans include: a thorough reform of the judicial, educational, and health systems, her widely opposed property tax reform, and her insistence on privatizing the national water and electricity industries.

Another reason for voters turning away from her might be her combative stance towards the European Economic Community. Heath said, "I think the public is tired of constantly attacking Europe."

Despite the numerous difficulties facing Thatcherism, no neutral observer is ready to dismiss Thatcher's significance.

### 欧洲议会选举给撒切尔主义敲了警钟

    欧洲议会选举给撒切尔主义敲了警钟
    美联社六月十九日发表新闻分析，分析英保守党在欧洲议会选举中失利的原因：
    撒切尔夫人为消除罢工、通货膨胀和高利率这些经济弊病奋斗了十年，如今这些弊病再度困扰英国。现在，她的保守党又在欧洲议会选举中吃了败仗。
    赢得了自一九七四年以来首次全国性胜利的反对党工党兴高采烈。在英国本土的七十八个选区中，工党赢得四十五席，保守党获三十二席，正好把一九八四年欧洲议会选举的情况倒了过来。那次选举中保守党以四十五对三十二领先。
    为了增加吸引力，工党修改了它的一些过左的政策。该党外交政策首脑杰拉尔德·考夫曼说，该党“自今年年初以来一直在不断取得进展”。
    前首相希思是撒切尔夫人在保守党内的反对者。他认为她已陷入严重的麻烦。他说：“如果在你执政十年之后仍有近二百万人失业，贸易等方面总共有一百五十亿英镑（合二百三十亿美元）的赤字，利率高达百分之十四，通货膨胀高达百分之八并且还在上升，那人民就一定会说……这难道是我们希望出现的情形吗？”
    能源大臣帕金森说：“所有这一切我们都承认。我们也不否认通货膨胀是一大祸害。我们正在设法解决嘛。”
    人们普遍认为，通货膨胀问题是由于撒切尔主义通过减税、减少政府干预、出售国有化企业、取消外汇管制和限制工会权利等措施来恢复经济方面取得成功而造成的。
    其结果是全国范围内的消费热、贸易赤字急剧增加、要求更大幅度地增加工资以及利率升得更高。
    工资和通货膨胀的螺旋式上升对于任何政府都是极可怕的事情。但是就撒切尔夫人的一些计划而言，还有更多的麻烦在等待着她。这些计划是：彻底改革司法、教育和卫生体系，她的遭到人们普遍反对的财产税改革，她坚持要对国有的供水和供电工业实行私有化。
    使选民们背离她的另一个原因也许是她对欧洲经济共同体采取好斗态度。希思说：“我认为老百姓对于整天抨击欧洲已经感到腻烦了。”
    尽管撒切尔主义遇到重重困难，但没有哪一位中立的观察家打算抹煞撒切尔的重要性。
