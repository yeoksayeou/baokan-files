	Shanxi Province, which ranks among the top in the country for its open policy to the outside world, is facing difficulties such as multiple social levies, multiple approval procedures, and the impact of previous turmoil on the tourism industry. To address these issues, the province has introduced three preferential measures to promote the smooth development of "three resources" enterprises.

	Yesterday morning, the Shaanxi Provincial People's Government held a symposium with foreign experts and representatives of foreign-invested enterprises in Shaanxi. Governor Hou Zongbin announced to the 46 representatives from Canada, the Soviet Union, Japan, the United States, and other ten countries and regions that all previously formulated preferential policies would remain unchanged. He also proposed three improvement measures:

	1. Reduce intermediate links. Personnel of foreign-invested enterprises no longer need to go through higher-level units and competent departments for approval to travel abroad. They can directly go to the provincial foreign affairs office to handle the relevant procedures.

	2. Establish a coordination leading group for "three resources" enterprises to rectify the乱摊派 (disorderly levies) and unreasonable charges, as well as the practices of eating, drinking, taking, and demanding. Foreign personnel can report any issues in this regard to this group at any time. In the future, violators will be seriously dealt with according to relevant anti-corruption regulations.

	3. For tourism enterprises, overdue loans can be deferred; for tourism enterprises in urgent need of loans and working capital, banks will do their best to help solve the problem; for tourism enterprises that need to maintain power supply, the power department will ensure the supply; for power fund-raising fees that are difficult to pay on time this year, payment can be deferred; for the land use fees levied on foreign-invested enterprises, the lowest standard can be applied this year.

	Deputy Mayor Zhao Yuhua of Xi'an supplemented on the spot: For Sino-foreign joint ventures and cooperative tourism hotels and restaurants, the municipal government has issued a notice that property tax and vehicle and vessel usage tax will be exempted this year.

	The governor also expressed at the symposium that the province will further establish and improve the management system for foreign-invested enterprises, increase the transparency of policies and laws, and open the door of reform and opening up wider to create a good investment environment for foreign friends to cooperate in Shaanxi.

    陕西省长宣布三条新措施
    推动“三资”企业顺利发展
    本报西安七月十二日电  记者景险峰报道：我国内陆省份对外开放名列前茅的陕西省，面对“三资”企业遇到社会摊派多、报批环节多，特别由于前期动乱影响造成旅游业经营困难的处境，推出三项优惠措施，推动“三资”企业的顺利发展。
    昨日上午，陕西省人民政府召集在陕外国专家、“三资”企业外方人员代表座谈。省长侯宗宾对来自加拿大、苏联、日本、美国等十个国家和地区的四十六名朋友当场宣布，以前制定的各项优惠政策保持不变，并提出三条改进措施：——减少中间环节。外商投资企业人员，出国不需要再经过上级单位及主管部门审批，直接到省外事办公室办理有关手续。
    ——成立“三资”企业协调领导小组，清理整顿对外商投资企业乱摊派和不合理收费以及吃、喝、拿、要等不正之风。外方人员对这方面的情况，可以随时向这个小组反映。今后若有违反者，按反腐败的有关规定严肃处理。
    ——旅游企业的到逾期贷款可以缓还；旅游企业急需解决的贷款和流动资金，确属困难的银行尽力帮助解决；旅游企业需要维持的电源，电力部门给予保证；电力集资费今年按期交纳有困难的，可以缓交；对外资企业所征收的土地使用费，今年内可按最低标准征收。
    西安市副市长赵毓华当场补充：对中外合资、合作的旅游宾馆、饭店，市政府已经发出通知，今年内免征房地产税和车船使用牌照税。
    省长在座谈会上还表示，将进一步建立健全外资企业管理制度，提高政策和法律的透明度，使改革开放的大门更加敞开，为外国朋友来陕合作创造良好的投资环境。
