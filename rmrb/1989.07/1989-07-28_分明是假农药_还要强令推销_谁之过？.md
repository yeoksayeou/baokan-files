Clearly Fake Pesticides Still Forced to be Sold - Who is to Blame?

Last July, the director of the agricultural technology station in Shizi Township, Zizhong County, Sichuan Province, Ye Yong, received two individuals who carried an introduction letter from Yunmeng Agricultural Chemical Factory in Xuanhan County. These individuals were promoting "Lekafu Milk Oil" pesticide, priced at 4.50 yuan per bottle, with a rebate of 0.10 yuan per bottle for the buyer. In order to receive the rebate, Ye Yong borrowed 5040 yuan from the township government's development fund to purchase 1120 bottles, collecting a rebate of 112 yuan.

After Ye Yong purchased this batch of pesticides in the name of the agricultural technology station, he sold 400 bottles. Farmers reported poor results after using the pesticides, but Ye Yong ignored their complaints.

After the problems with this batch of pesticides were exposed, sales became difficult. Ye Yong was unable to repay the money borrowed from the township. At this point, the township Party Committee Secretary, Ye Huafu, seeing his son Ye Yong in a difficult situation, brought up the matter of selling this batch of pesticides at a township Party Committee meeting. The Party Committee decided that farmers purchasing 50 kilograms of grain seeds would be given 7 bottles of the pesticide. The families of township cadres were exempt from this requirement. Thus, the remaining 700-plus bottles of "Lekafu Milk Oil" were quickly sold.

The Yinshan Police Station and the Yinshan Industrial and Commercial Bureau sent personnel to investigate this case. Ye Huafu, the father of Ye Yong and the township Party Committee Secretary, told the investigating officers, "The decision to bundle this batch of pesticides was collectively researched by our Party Committee. We collectively take responsibility. After all, the policy of the Communist Party is not to strike down a large number of people."

    分明是假农药　还要强令推销
    谁之过？
    去年7月，我省资中县狮子乡农技站站长叶勇，接待了两位持宣汉县云蒙农用化工厂介绍信的来人。来人推销“乐果乳油”农药，每瓶4.50元，买方可按每瓶0.10元收取回扣。为了吃回扣，叶勇在乡政府发展资金中借了5040元，购买了1120瓶，收回扣费112元。
    叶勇以农技站名义买下这批农药后，先后出售了400瓶，农户使用后反应不好。叶勇置之不理。
    这批农药问题暴露后，销售就困难了。叶勇借乡里的钱无法归还。这时，乡党委书记叶华富见儿子叶勇处境不妙，就把这批农药出售的事提到乡党委会上研究，乡党委决定，农民购买50公斤谷种搭配7瓶。乡干部家里买谷种例外。于是，剩下的700多瓶“乐果乳油”很快销售完。
    资中县银山派出所、银山工商所派人对此案作了调查。叶勇的父亲、乡党委书记叶华富对办案人员说：“搭配这批农药是我们党委集体研究的，我们集体负责。反正共产党的政策是不打击一大片。”
