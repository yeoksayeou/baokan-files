Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, July 25th.

African leaders today, at the 25th summit of the Organization of African Unity, expressed their concerns over the situation in Southern Africa and called for peace and stability on the African continent.

Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda pointed out that the process of Namibian independence, as well as the peace talks between Angola and Mozambique and their respective anti-government groups, have brought peace, unity, and harmony to the African continent. This has also strengthened the revolutionary momentum to dismantle the apartheid system. He stated that under increasing international pressure, the South African authorities might be willing to resolve the apartheid issue through negotiations; for this, the "Organization of African Unity should be prepared."

He said that the unique position of the current chairman of the OAU, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, would enable him to build a bridge of unity between Africa and the Arab world.

Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi accused the South African authorities of obstructing the process of Namibian independence and manipulating elections. He demanded that the United Nations increase the number of troops in the Transitional Assistance Group from 4,650 to the originally planned 7,500.

Sudanese Prime Minister Omar al-Bashir called on the member states of the OAU to unite and strive for the complete liberation of the African continent and the total abolition of the apartheid system.

Other African leaders who spoke at today's meeting included those from Burkina Faso and Sierra Leone.

    非洲国家领导人呼吁实现非洲和平稳定
    新华社亚的斯亚贝巴7月25日电　非洲国家领导人今天在非洲统一组织第25届首脑会议上发言时，纷纷表示对南部非洲局势的关注，呼吁非洲大陆实现和平与稳定。
    赞比亚总统卡翁达指出，纳米比亚的独立进程以及安哥拉和莫桑比克与其反政府组织的和谈给非洲大陆带来了和平、团结与和睦，同时也加强了摧毁种族隔离制度的革命动力。他表示，南非当局在国际压力日趋强烈的情况下，可能会愿意通过谈判解决种族隔离制度问题；对此，“非洲统一组织应当作好准备”。
    他说，非统组织现任主席、埃及总统穆巴拉克的独特地位将使他能在非洲和阿拉伯世界之间架起一座团结携手的桥梁。
    肯尼亚总统莫伊指责南非当局阻挠纳米比亚的独立进程，操纵选举，要求联合国将过渡时期援助团的部队从4650 名增至原来规定的7500名。
    苏丹新总理巴希尔呼吁非统组织成员国团结一致，争取非洲大陆的彻底解放和完全废除种族隔离制度。
