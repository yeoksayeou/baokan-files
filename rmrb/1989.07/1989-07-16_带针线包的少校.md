Zhang Renzhong, the deputy commander of the maintenance squadron of a certain aviation regiment in the Guangzhou Air Force, is a burly man from Shandong, a formidable and imposing Air Force lieutenant colonel. However, he carries a sewing kit around like an old lady, often sitting cross-legged on the airfield, sewing diligently. He often tells the soldiers, "We who work in maintenance must have a fondness for our planes and not let them wear tattered clothes."

To ensure the planes are well-maintained, after each flight, Zhang Renzhong is the last to leave the field. He inspects every plane that lands, making sure every piece of fabric cover is securely fastened before he feels at ease. Especially the cover on the vertical stabilizer of the plane, which is particularly difficult to cover and remove, so many squadrons do not cover it. But Zhang Renzhong insists on covering it, and if it's not covered, he will call you back to do it. He says, "Although this is not a critical part, covering it for a day or two won't cause any problems, but over time, the drive shaft will rust, making it less responsive and affecting flight safety." One night when he was the squadron commander, a sudden storm hit with heavy rain. He jumped out of bed, grabbed a flashlight, and called two new soldiers to rush to the airfield, saying he wanted to check the covers. The two new soldiers asked in surprise, "The covers are already secured, aren't they?" Zhang Renzhong said, "With such strong winds, the covers might get blown off, so we should check to be safe." After securing all the covers, he realized he had forgotten to wear a raincoat in his haste and was soaked to the skin. These two soldiers later found out that whenever there was a sudden storm at night, Zhang Renzhong would rush to the airfield to check, so much so that several officers and soldiers living near the squadron headquarters would get up and put on their raincoats and boots in advance.

Officers and soldiers say that Zhang Renzhong loves planes like he loves his 35-year-old daughter. He is now 38 years old and has worked in ground support for 20 years, serving as the squadron commander for 6 years. By all rights, his skills should be quite proficient, but to better maintain the planes, he still reviews his manuals and writes notes after returning from the airfield. He has recorded 5 large volumes of aircraft faults and their elimination methods. As a result, although he only attended four years of elementary school, he became the only aviation engineer in the regiment and was praised by everyone as the "troubleshooting king," resolving over 440 complex faults.

Under Zhang Renzhong's influence, the second squadron, which he once commanded, has dozens of sewing kits and a group of "troubleshooting experts." Among the three external field maintenance squadrons in the regiment, the second squadron has maintained the highest flight readiness and quality rates for six consecutive years. Pilots say, "The planes from the second squadron are the most reliable to fly."

Recently, Zhang Renzhong was promoted to deputy squadron commander, but he still carries his sewing kit. He said, "I want to use this opportunity to get everyone in the squadron to develop the habit of carrying a sewing kit, so that all the planes in the squadron are reliable for the pilots to fly."

    带针线包的少校
    广州空军航空兵某团机务副大队长张仁忠，是一个五大三粗的山东大汉，一个慓悍威武的空军少校，但他偏偏却像个老太太似的，老带着个针线包，经常在机场上盘腿一坐，飞针走线。他常对战士们说：“咱们搞机务的，要对自己的飞机有感情，不能让飞机穿破衣服。”
    为了给飞机“穿”好衣服，每次飞行结束，张仁忠都最后一个退场，要把最后落地的飞机都检查一遍，把每一块蒙布都盖好捆紧才放心。特别是飞机垂直尾翼上的那块，盖起来爬上爬下特别费劲，第二天脱蒙布又费事，所以不少中队都不给垂直尾翼盖蒙布。可张仁忠却非要盖上不可，走了也将把你叫回来盖上。他说这里虽然不是主要部位，一天两天不盖也确实没事，但时间长了传动轴就会长锈，操纵起来就不灵活，影响飞行安全。还是在张仁忠当中队长时的一天夜里，突然狂风大作，大雨瓢泼，他一骨碌爬起来，抓起手电筒叫了两个新战士就往机场跑，说要去看看蒙布。两个新战士奇怪地问：蒙布不是盖好了吗？张仁忠说：“这么大的风，蒙布说不定会掀开，还是去看看保险。”等把所有的蒙布重新盖严捆牢时，他才发现自己身上没盖“蒙布”——出门时心急忘了穿雨衣，大雨把全身都浇透了。这两个战士后来发现，夜里只要突然刮风下雨，张仁忠都要往机场跑一趟，以致住在中队部附近的几个干部战士，每到这个时候干脆先起来穿好雨衣水靴等着。
    干部战士们说，张仁忠爱飞机，就像爱他那35岁才得来的宝贝女儿。他今年38岁了，吃了20年的地勤饭，光机务中队长就当了6年，按理说业务已经相当熟练了，可他为了更好地维护飞机，现在每次从机场回来还要翻翻业务书，写写心得体会，有关的飞机故障及排除方法就记了5大本。结果，他虽然只念过4年小学，却成为全团唯一的航空工程师，被大家誉为“排故大王”，先后排除各种疑难故障440多起。
    在张仁忠的带动下，他当过中队长的二中队有了几十个针线包，出现了一批“排故小王”。在全团三个外场机务中队里，二中队连续6年飞机出勤率、优质率最高。飞行员们说：“二中队的飞机飞起来最放心。”
    不久前，张仁忠当了副大队长，但他的针线包还是没有放下，他说：“我要趁这个机会使全大队的人都养成带针线包的习惯，使全大队的飞机都让飞行员飞起来放心。”
