    There is a saying in China's symphony orchestra circles: "Composers earn less than copyists." This, of course, refers to income.
    It is said that from the end of last December to the beginning of March this year, the Central Symphony Orchestra voluntarily stopped all rehearsals and performances. This has never happened in the 30-plus years since the orchestra was founded. Orchestra leader Chen Rutan said, "In the six years I have been the leader, this is the fifth time I have felt the orchestra is at a low ebb, but this time it seems we have hit rock bottom."
    The irrational system and economic scarcity, influencing each other, have caused the symphony orchestra to sink into a baffling low point from which it cannot escape.
    Various problems within arts organizations are almost all present in the Central Symphony Orchestra. For example, there is an unwieldy bureaucracy, and the "iron rice bowl" system, which makes one shake one's head in dismay. The Central Symphony Orchestra manages the symphony orchestra, chorus, chamber music ensemble, and composition group, among other units. These units of different natures have been tied together for a long time without flexibility. The entire orchestra has 500 people, but nearly 1/5 of them are idle. There are also a large number of "level five cadres" who only receive salaries without doing any work, causing great difficulties for the orchestra's management. Moreover, the orchestra itself lacks personnel authority, financial authority, and external authority, making this unwieldy organization inevitably inconvenient to operate.
    The state's annual financial allocation to the Central Symphony Orchestra, with 70% going to salaries, leaves barely enough for office expenses. By the first two months of this year, the Central Symphony Orchestra's financial deficit had already become quite large.
    To get out of the economic predicament, they have struggled. In 1988, the symphony orchestra established a recording company. But these artists are really not good at business, and the recording company failed after half a year. They also sought corporate sponsorship, and some companies agreed to sponsor them, but they could not accept the additional conditions because they did not want the Central Symphony Orchestra to change its name.
    The financial director of the Central Symphony Orchestra complained, "We feel bad when we don't perform, but the more we perform, the more we lose money."
    A famous conductor in the orchestra said, "We need to improve ourselves on one hand and work hard on the other. I also need to give lectures, teach, and do work to popularize symphonic music, to gain the attention of leaders for symphonic music, and to let more people understand and love symphonic music." However, the symphony orchestra does not have the conditions to popularize symphonic music. They have no place to rehearse, cannot afford the necessary instruments, have no money for popular performances, and cannot deliver services to the doorstep.
    In the face of art and money, the members can only choose the latter. Since the symphony orchestra cannot provide them with the conditions to fulfill their artistic mission, the phenomenon of freelancing has become a dispersing force for the symphony orchestra.
    How to get out of this low point? Everyone is waiting, with some expectations. Although everyone is confused, they are not very afraid. Some people have prepared for the worst: "At most, the orchestra will be disbanded."
    How to deal with this situation? It is worth pondering.

    中央乐团交响乐队为何走向谷底
    ——调查手记
    王前海
    中国交响乐界流行着这样一句话：作曲的不如抄谱的。这当然是指经济收入而言。
    据说，从去年12月底至今年3月初，中央乐团交响乐队自动停止了一切排练和演出。这是建队30余年以来从来没有过的事。乐队队长陈汝棠先生说，“我担任队长六年以来，已经是第五次感觉到乐队走向低谷，但这一次恐怕是走向谷底了。”
    不合理的体制和经济的匮乏，两方面相互影响，使交响乐队陷入令人困惑的谷底而不能自拔。
    文艺团体中的各种弊病，在中央乐团内几乎应有尽有。譬如机构臃肿，譬如大锅饭，谈起来叫人摇头不已。中央乐团下辖交响乐队、合唱队、室内音乐队、创作组等单位，这些不同性质的单位长期被捆绑在一起，没有灵活性。全团500人，而闲散人员却将近1／5。更有大量的“五号干部”，只领工资不干事，给乐团管理带来极大的困难。更何况，乐团本身就缺乏人事权、财权和对外权，这个臃肿的机构难免行动不便。
    国家每年给中央乐团的财政拨款，工资占去70％，余下的连办公费也不够维持。今年头两个月，中央乐团财政赤字已经相当大了。
    为摆脱经济困境，他们奋斗过。1988年，交响乐队办起了录音公司。但这些艺术家实在不善经商，录音公司半年之后便流产了。他们也曾争取企业赞助，而且有一些公司答应赞助他们，只是他们不能接受附加条件，因为他们不愿意中央乐团改变名称。
    中央乐团财会科科长抱怨说：“我们不演出，心里过意不去，可越演出越赔钱。”
    乐团一位著名指挥家说，“我们一方面要自我完善，一方面要去实干。我还要去做报告，讲学，去做普及交响乐的工作，争取领导对交响乐的关心，让更多的人理解、热爱交响乐。”但是交响乐队没有普及交响乐的条件。他们没有地方排练，买不起所需要的乐器，没有钱去普及演出，送货上门。
    在艺术与金钱面前，队员们只能选择后者。交响乐队既然不能给他们完成艺术使命的条件，走穴现象已成为交响乐队涣散的力量。
    究竟怎样走出谷底？大家都在那里耗着，有所期待。虽然都很惶惑，但并不怎么害怕。有些人作好了最坏打算：“最多不过乐队解散而已。”
    这种状况怎么办？值得深思。
