In the afternoon of July 23, a mid-sized van drove straight to Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation. The passengers were General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Jiang Zemin, Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee Guan Guangfu, and Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee Zheng Yunfei.

Jiang Zemin first visited the No. 1 Steel Plant's open-hearth furnace workshop. The furnace roared with flames, and the heat was intense. Workers sweated profusely, battling fiercely in front of the furnace. According to a factory leader, the temperature outside the workshop reached 40 degrees Celsius, while inside it was 50 to 60 degrees. Jiang Zemin walked forward, shook hands with the workers, and thanked them for their hard work in the high temperatures. Workers at Furnace No. 1 and Furnace No. 3 recognized Jiang Zemin and firmly shook his hand, exchanging greetings with the General Secretary.

At the cold-rolled sheet plant, Jiang Zemin carefully inspected the 1.7-meter cold-rolling mill and inquired in detail about its condition.

In a meeting room, Jiang Zemin held a discussion with the company's leaders and some workers and technicians. The company leaders reported to Jiang Zemin on the company's rapid development since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and its adherence to party building. The company leader said that during the recent turmoil, a few bad elements deceived students and blocked the roads to the factory, but the entire company did not stop production for a single day. Many workers lived far away, and to get to work, they took water routes when land routes were blocked, rode bicycles when they couldn't take buses, and walked when they couldn't ride bicycles. To ensure production did not stop, many workers stayed in the factory day and night. Despite the difficulties, the company maintained high production in the first half of the year and completed its production tasks well.

Jiang Zemin said after listening, "The working class is the most organized and disciplined, and is the main force in socialist construction. To achieve the Four Modernizations, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class and fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers. During the turmoil, Wuhan Steel not only did not stop production but also maintained high production, which is remarkable and reflects the high political awareness and sense of ownership of the working class."

During the discussion, some comrades mentioned that large and medium-sized enterprises currently face many difficulties. Jiang Zemin said, "Large and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of the socialist economy. The state should help large and medium-sized enterprises overcome difficulties and enhance their vitality. Large and medium-sized enterprises should also further promote reform and opening up and contribute more to the country."

Jiang Zemin emphasized in the discussion that party leadership and ideological and political work must be strengthened in enterprises. Large and medium-sized enterprises should have a lean ideological and political work team and necessary party work functional departments. Party branches should play the role of a combat fortress, and Communist Party members should play a vanguard and exemplary role.

A comrade who had recently graduated from a university and started working at Wuhan Steel said during the discussion, "The recent turmoil has many causes, but in recent years, materialism has indeed been emphasized more, while spirituality has been emphasized less, leading to confusion in people's thoughts. This is also a cause. People still need some spiritual guidance." Jiang Zemin nodded in agreement as he listened. Jiang Zemin said, "As soon as I entered the Wuhan Steel gate, I saw the Wuhan Steel spirit—'hard work, unity, strictness, and innovation.' Our country is still not rich, and we indeed need hard work and self-improvement, preparing to tighten our belts for a few years. In the future, college students should truly experience some practical work. Workers in steel and iron plants work in temperatures of 50 to 60 degrees. If college students go to these places to experience the hard work of workers and understand the thoughts and feelings of workers, it will definitely be beneficial to their growth."

At the end of the discussion, the General Secretary and the accompanying Minister of Water Resources Yang Zhenhuai and Minister of Agriculture He Kang shook hands and said goodbye to the comrades who participated in the discussion. Jiang Zemin asked the comrades who participated in the discussion to convey his greetings to the 140,000 employees of Wuhan Steel.

    总书记视察武钢
    新华社记者　陈乃进
    7月23日下午，一辆中型面包车直驶武汉钢铁公司。车上下来的是中共中央总书记江泽民、湖北省委书记关广富和武汉市委书记郑云飞一行。
    江泽民同志首先来到第一炼钢厂平炉车间。车间里的炼钢炉火光熊熊，热浪炙人，工人同志挥洒汗水，紧张战斗在炉前。据厂里的一位领导同志介绍，车间外最高气温达四十摄氏度，车间内温度有五六十度。江泽民同志走上前去，同工人握手，感谢工人同志在高温下坚持工作。一号炉、三号炉前的工人认出了江泽民同志，他们紧紧握住总书记的手，同总书记互致问候。
    在公司冷轧板厂，江泽民同志仔细地察看了一米七冷轧机，详细询问了冷轧机的情况。
    在一个会议室里，江泽民同志同公司的领导和部分工人、技术人员座谈。公司领导向江泽民同志汇报了公司自十一届三中全会以来迅速发展的情况和坚持党的建设的情况。公司领导同志说，在前一段的动乱中，少数坏人蒙蔽学生堵塞了通向工厂的道路，但整个公司没有停一天产。许多职工家住很远，为了赶到工厂上班，旱路不通，就走水路；乘不了汽车，就骑自行车；自行车也骑不了，就步行上班。为了不使生产中断，许多职工日夜吃住在厂里。在非常困难的情况下，公司上半年仍保持了高产，较好地完成了生产任务。
    江泽民同志听后说，工人阶级最富于组织性纪律性，是社会主义建设的主力军。要把四个现代化搞好，必须全心全意依靠工人阶级，充分发挥广大工人群众的积极性。在动乱期间，武钢不仅没有停产，而且还保持了高产，是很了不起的，体现了工人阶级的高度的政治觉悟和主人翁精神。
    在座谈中一些同志谈到，现在大中型企业面临不少困难。江泽民同志说，大中型企业是社会主义经济的骨干力量。国家要帮助大中型企业克服困难，增强大中型企业的活力。大中型企业也要进一步搞好改革开放，为国家多做贡献。
    江泽民同志在座谈中强调指出，在企业中要加强党的领导，加强思想政治工作。大中型企业要有一支精干的思想政治工作队伍和必要的党的工作职能部门。党支部要发挥战斗堡垒作用，共产党员要发挥先锋模范作用。
    一位从高校毕业到武钢工作不久的同志在座谈中说，这次动乱有多种原因，但近年来，确实讲物质多了，讲精神少了，人们思想混乱了，这也是一个原因。人还是要讲一点精神的。江泽民同志一边听，一边点头。江泽民同志说，一进武钢大门就看到了武钢精神——“艰苦奋斗，团结协作，从严求实，改革创新”。现在，我们的国家还不富裕，确实需要艰苦奋斗，奋发图强，准备过几年紧日子。今后大学生还是应该真正接触一点实践。炼钢厂、炼铁厂的工人在五六十度的高温下工作，大学生到这些地方体验工人的辛勤劳动，体验工人的思想感情，一定会对他们的成长有好处。
    座谈结束时，总书记和随同来厂的水利部长杨振怀、农业部长何康同参加座谈的同志握手道别。江泽民同志请参加座谈的同志转达他对武钢14万职工的问候。
