		Trade Volume Exceeds Last Year's

Recently, the China Northeast Region and Inner Mongolia Export Commodities Fair was held in Dalian. This was the largest foreign economic and trade activity held nationwide since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, and it naturally attracted much attention.

The fair was held at the Dalian Exhibition Center. At 9 AM on July 1st, we entered the exhibition hall with thousands of Chinese and foreign businessmen. The exhibition booths were bustling with activity; some were examining samples and discussing, others were haggling over prices, and those without seats stood to negotiate.

Before the fair opened, people were uncertain: Would this fair be successful? Would foreign businessmen come?

On the first day, 690 foreign businessmen attended, which was a bit surprising and unprecedented in the previous two fairs. The expected trading peak, which was anticipated to occur on the seventh day, actually appeared on the third day. From the fourth day onwards, the daily trading volume increased at a rate of 40 million, 50 million, and 60 million US dollars.

The second Northeast Region and Inner Mongolia Export Commodities Fair held here last year had a trading volume of 3.4 billion US dollars. Despite facing many difficulties and interferences, this fair's trading volume exceeded 4.9 billion US dollars.

The fair signed 37 joint venture and cooperation projects, with a contract amount of 83.56 million US dollars, significantly surpassing the previous fair. A responsible official from Liaoning Province happily told us that they had signed 15 joint venture and cooperation projects and 4 contracts for utilizing foreign loans to introduce equipment, with a total amount of 52.4 million US dollars.

Other provinces and municipalities also achieved unexpected good results.

Although this regional fair only lasted 10 days, it reflected, from one aspect, China's broad participation in international exchange and division of labor, an open trend that no one can stop.

		Determination and Confidence to Step onto the International Stage

The organizers of this fair, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia, and the cities of Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, and Dalian, are important foreign exchange earning regions in China. They have vast territories, rich export resources, close ties with Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and foreign countries, and each has its own advantages in developing foreign economies. They regard this fair as an opportunity to further step onto the international stage. As Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin said at the opening ceremony, holding this large-scale export commodities fair will, with facts, inform the international community that China's insistence on reform and opening up is unwavering. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade organized 10 professional companies' business elites to guide and coordinate the fair. The organizers, including provincial and municipal leaders, also personally attended the fair to deploy and inspect the work.

We entered the Jilin Province negotiation room and saw many foreign businessmen flipping through a bilingual booklet on utilizing foreign investment projects. In this 30-page material, 92 economic and technological cooperation projects, from content to production scale and cooperation methods, were clearly written and easy to understand. A business staff member said: These projects are very economically beneficial, and many foreign businessmen have already entered substantive negotiations with them.

We saw that these regions' attractiveness to foreign businessmen lies not only in their possession of a vast potential market but also in their sincere intention to maintain openness. As a window, Dalian City created a good environment for all guests, with upper and lower levels doing a good job of reception and service. The negotiation rooms added more than 20 telephones, telex, and fax machines.

		China's Open Policy Has Not Changed

Foreign businessmen participating in the fair not only saw with their own eyes that China's situation is stable but also witnessed that China's reform and opening-up policy has not changed.

The representative of the Beijing office of BASF from the Federal Republic of Germany said that this time the company sent him to Dalian just to see the situation and did not plan to do business. When he saw the lively atmosphere at the opening ceremony and the reception, with more foreign businessmen than last year, he felt that China's open policy has indeed not changed. The chairman of the board of directors of Criders Inc. from California, USA, Li Xiangrun, said that before coming to Dalian, his friends could not understand him, but he brought his wife and his old friends as scheduled. He said, upon arriving here, he found the social order stable, very free, and very convenient.

Foreign businessmen participating in the fair threw themselves into negotiations. The president of Nichi-Chu Corporation signed a cooperation project with the New Gold County, Pulan Town in Dalian City to invest hundreds of millions of US dollars in developing tidal flats for shrimp farming and cold storage processing. He said: From the fair, I felt that China will not close the door to opening up. Those who come here early will have more opportunities.

    不可阻挡的趋势
    ——东北地区暨内蒙古出口商品交易会侧记
    沙秀敏　陆振华
            成交额超过去年同期
    最近在大连举行了中国东北地区暨内蒙古出口商品交易会，这是在北京平息反革命暴乱之后全国首次举行的最大的对外经贸活动，自然引人注目。
    交易会设在大连博览中心。7月1日上午9点，我们随着上千名中外客商步入交易会大厅，只见展谈间一派繁忙，有的在看样洽谈，有的在讨价还价，没地方坐的干脆站着谈开了。
    交易会揭幕之前，人们心中并无把握：这届交易会能开成功吗？外商会来吗？
    第一天到会的外商达到690多人，有点出乎意料，也是前两届没有过的。预计7天后才会有的成交高潮，结果第三天便出现了，从第四天起，每天则以4000万、5000万、6000万美元的成交速度发展。
    去年同期在这里举行的第二届东北地区暨内蒙古出口商品交易会，成交额为3.4亿美元。这届交易会虽面临着许多困难和干扰，成交额却超过了4.9亿美元。
    交易会上签订了37个合资合作项目，合同金额达8356万美元，大大超过了上届交易会。辽宁省负责同志高兴地对我们说，他们已签订了15个合资合作项目和4项利用国外贷款引进设备的合同，总金额5240万美元。
    其他各省区市交易团也都取得了意想不到的好成绩。
    这次区域性交易会虽只举行了10天，但它从一个侧面反映了我国广泛参与国际交换和分工的开放大趋势，是任何人也阻挡不了的。
        走向国际舞台的决心和信心
    主办这次交易会的辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、内蒙古和沈阳、长春、哈尔滨、大连三省一区四市，是我国重要的出口创汇地区，地域辽阔，有丰富的出口资源，同港、澳、台和国外的联系密切，各自拥有自己的发展对外经济的优势。他们把这次交易会作为进一步走向国际舞台的良机。正如经贸部部长郑拓彬在开幕式上说的，举办这次具有相当规模的出口商品交易会，以事实向国际社会表明，中国继续坚持改革开放是坚定不移的。经贸部组织10个专业总公司业务骨干到会指导协调。主办单位的省长、市长也都亲临交易会部署检查工作。
    我们走进吉林省洽谈间，看到许多外商翻阅一本中英文对照的利用外资项目的小册子。在这本30页的材料里，92个经济技术合作项目从内容、生产规模到合作方式等，写得清清楚楚，一目了然。一位业务人员说：这些项目都是很有经济效益的，不少外商已同他们进入到实质性谈判阶段。
    我们看到，这些地区对外商的吸引力，不仅在于它们拥有巨大的潜在市场，而且在于都有坚持开放的诚意。作为窗口的大连市为各路来宾创造了良好的环境，上上下下，做好接待服务，展谈间增设了20多部电话和电传、传真。
      中国的开放政策没有变
    参加交易会的外商不仅亲眼见到我国局势稳定，也目睹了我国改革开放的政策没有变。
    联邦德国巴斯夫公司驻北京办事处代表说，这次公司派我来大连，原只是想看看形势，没准备谈生意。当看到开幕式和酒会气氛热烈，出席的外商比去年还多时，感到中国开放政策真没有变。美国加利福尼亚州克瑞帝维有限公司董事长李相润说，临来大连之前，他的朋友不能理解他，可他携同太太和他的老朋友如期来了。他说，来到这里一看，社会秩序安定，很自由，很方便。
    参加交易会的外商，一头扎到谈判桌上。日中实业株式会社社长同大连市新金县普兰店镇谈成了投资上百万美元的开发滩涂养虾和冷藏加工的合作项目。他说：从交易会上，我感受到了中国不会关上对外开放的大门。谁要早来这里，谁就能更多地抓住机会。
