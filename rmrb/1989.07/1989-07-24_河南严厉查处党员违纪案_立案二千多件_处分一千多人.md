	Henan Province has recently investigated and punished four serious disciplinary violations by city and county-level leaders.

	Ding Runming, a member of the An Yang Municipal Committee and deputy mayor, abused his power to demand 8,000 yuan from the Pingyuan Pharmaceutical Factory in August 1987 to fund his son's "self-financed" university education, seriously violating party discipline. Ding Runming has been removed from his positions as a member of the An Yang Municipal Committee and a member of the Municipal Committee.

	From 1986 to 1988, the Luoyang Public Security Bureau misappropriated confiscated funds to purchase a large number of vehicles in violation of regulations. Song Wenxue, a member of the Luoyang Municipal Committee, head of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee, and director of the Public Security Bureau, was primarily responsible for this. With his approval, the Public Security Bureau sold three vehicles, earning 195,000 yuan. Consequently, the Luoyang Municipal Committee and the Municipal People's Congress have removed him from his positions as head of the Political and Legal Affairs Committee and director of the Public Security Bureau. Recently, with the approval of the Provincial Committee, it was decided to remove him from his position as a member of the Luoyang Municipal Committee.

	Zhang Taiyi, the Party Secretary and President of the Luoyang Intermediate People's Court, without funds, state plans, purchase permits, or transport permits, conspired with three vice-presidents to misappropriate execution funds and construction funds allocated by higher authorities for a total of 1.91 million yuan from June to October 1988. He sent people to Shenzhen to purchase 12 smuggled sedans. After research by the Luoyang Municipal Committee and approval by the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, it was decided to give him a serious warning within the party.

	Teng Hongze, an alternate member of the Kaifeng Municipal Committee and the Party Secretary and President of the People's Bank of Kaifeng, took advantage of his position to engage in multiple instances of sexual misconduct from July to October 1988. Teng has been removed from his positions as an alternate member of the Municipal Committee and Party Secretary of the People's Bank of Kaifeng. Relevant departments have suggested removing him from his position as President of the People's Bank of Kaifeng.

	From January to May this year, the discipline inspection system in Henan Province investigated and punished 2,150 cases of party members violating discipline, disciplining 1,183 party members, including 13 at the county level and above. The Provincial Committee has decided that in the second half of the year, starting from the leading cadres, it will continue to resolutely investigate and punish cases of embezzlement and bribery, power abuse and extortion, extravagance and corruption, squandering state and collective assets, leading cadres in the allocation of personnel, funds, and materials for personal gain and accepting bribes, as well as using their positions to sell state-planned scarce goods in "official speculation" and other cases.
