	Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch Deputy Director Zhang Junseng announced at the expanded meeting of the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po editorial committee yesterday that the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch has decided to stop retaining Hong Kong Wen Wei Po Chairman Li Ziyong.

	Zhang Junseng said at the expanded meeting of the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po editorial committee that Wen Wei Po is a mainland-funded enterprise, and the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch is entrusted to manage it. He introduced that Mr. Li Ziyong had applied for retirement to the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch as early as the end of 1985, which has been approved, and he has received all his retirement benefits. At that time, considering the specific circumstances, the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch requested Li Ziyong to continue serving as the chairman for a period of time, with his salary remaining unchanged.

	Zhang Junseng said that the appointment and dismissal of internal cadres of Wen Wei Po have a normal procedure. Today, Li Ziyong took abnormal measures to dismiss the position of Deputy Director Chen Bojian, which we deeply regret. Now, the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch has no choice but to decide to stop retaining Li Ziyong. The position of the chairman of Wen Wei Po will be appointed by the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch in the future.

    新华社香港分社停止留用香港《文汇报》社长李子诵
    新华社香港7月15日电  新华社香港分社副社长张浚生昨天在香港《文汇报》社社务委员会扩大会议上宣布，新华社香港分社决定停止对香港《文汇报》社社长李子诵的留用。
    张浚生在香港《文汇报》社社务委员会扩大会议上说，《文汇报》是一个中资企业，新华社香港分社受委托代为管理。他介绍说，李子诵先生早于1985年底即向新华社香港分社申请退休，已获批准，并领取了全部退休金。当时照顾到具体情况，新华社香港分社请李子诵留任社长一段时间，工资照发。
    张浚生说，《文汇报》内部干部的任免，有一个正常的手续。今天李子诵采取不正常的手段，解聘副社长陈伯坚的职务，对此，我们深感遗憾。现在新华社香港分社不得已，只能决定停止对李子诵的留用。《文汇报》社社长之职，新华社香港分社日后将另行委派。
