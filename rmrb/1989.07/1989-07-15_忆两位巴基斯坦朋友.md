The beautiful country of Pakistan, a land of courtesy in West Asia, is home to a simple, kind, and friendly people who leave a lasting impression on all who visit.

Older Brother Sediqua

I spent a year in the city of Kamra, where I welcomed the sunrise with the birdsong and bid farewell to the setting sun with the sound of camel bells.

At the Kamra Aircraft Repair Factory, I met a tall, slender air force lieutenant. He spoke fluent Chinese and had a good sense of humor: "I am Sediqua—'qua' is the same as 'collapse' in Chinese, with the 'earth' radical. If I have the 'earth' radical, I will collapse!" Hearing Chinese in a foreign land, of course, made me feel especially close to him.

"We are from the same hometown. I graduated from the Northeastern Institute of Technology, Mechanical Engineering Department. I rode a bicycle all over Shenyang." He was truly my "hometown brother," and his Chinese even had a Shenyang accent, and he could say "very good."

Sediqua was only 25 years old and still unmarried. He said it was the result of learning about late marriage from China.

While studying in China, he once had no food coupons and was turned away at a restaurant, so when we met, he immediately asked me, "Can you eat without food coupons?" When I said it was no problem, he laughed, genuinely laughed.

He missed the time he spent in China.

"I also held a little flag and shouted, 'Down with Jiang Qing! Down with Wang Hongwen!' I walked all day and wasn't tired at all. The bread and eggs given to me, I ate them all." He laughed heartily, and his expression was touching.

During the time we spent together, older brother Sediqua served as our liaison officer, taking care of us in every way. To this day, we still miss this Muslim brother.

Friendship at the Market

The Friday Market in Islamabad operates according to Muslim customs, opening once a week. It has everything from general goods, miscellaneous items, furniture, and clothing to vegetables, fish, fruits, and poultry. Halid's fish stall is one of them.

After my first encounter with him, Halid prepared fresh fish for us every Friday. Sometimes, if we couldn't make it to his stall on Friday, he would sell the good fish he had prepared for us only in the evening to other people. When he found out we liked eel, Halid went all the way to Karachi, hundreds of kilometers away, to get it, then cut off the head and tail, froze the fish, and sold it to us. During our stay, he always treated us this way.

Before we were about to return to our country, he repeatedly reminded me to tell him when our departure date was confirmed, so he could get the best-tasting fish from Karachi for us one last time. Later, I felt it was not convenient to bother him anymore, so I did not contact him. To this day, I still feel sorry for not saying goodbye to Halid, this Pakistani brother who opened his heart to us!

Halid once said, "The Chinese are brothers." I hope he knows that I also miss him, this Pakistani brother!

    忆两位巴基斯坦朋友
    李霞晨
    美丽的巴基斯坦，西亚大陆上的礼仪之邦，那里朴实、善良而友好的人民，使到过那里的人都终生难忘。
    老弟塞迪夸
    我羁旅在卡姆拉城一年，与这小城在百鸟啾鸣声里共迎日出，又在驼铃声中同送夕阳落山。
    在卡姆拉飞机大修厂，我结识了一个细高个空军中尉。他操着熟练的汉语，很有幽默感：“我叫塞迪夸——夸就是垮台的垮去土字，有土旁我就垮台了！”在异邦能听到汉语，当然格外让人感到亲切。
    “咱们是老乡，我毕业于东北工学院机械系。沈阳我骑自行车跑遍了。”他真的是我“老乡”，连他讲的汉语里也夹着沈阳腔，还能说“贼好”呢。
    塞迪夸年方25岁，尚未结婚，他说是学习中国晚婚的结果。
    在我国留学时，他曾因没粮票而在饭店碰壁，所以这次一见面就问我，吃饭没粮票行不？当我说没问题时，他笑了，由衷地笑了。
    他怀念在中国度过的岁月。
    “我也拿着小旗子，高喊打倒江青！打倒王洪文！走了一天一点也不累。发给我的面包、鸡蛋都吃了。”他哈哈大笑，脸上的表情是感人的。
    在我们相处的日子里，老弟塞迪夸当我们的联络官，对我们的照顾无微不至。时至今日，我们仍然怀念这位穆斯林兄弟。
    市场上的友谊
    伊斯兰堡星期五市场，是按穆斯林规矩营业的，每星期五开业一次，从百货、杂品、家具、衣服到蔬菜、鱼肉、水果、蛋禽，应有尽有。哈立德鱼摊就是其中之一。
    我和他第一次接触之后，他每个星期五都为我们准备好鲜鱼。有时我们因事没能在星期五上他的鱼摊，他为我们准备的好鱼也要到晚上才出售给其他人。当得知我们喜欢带鱼时，哈立德专门到几百公里外的卡拉奇去进货，然后斩头去尾，将鱼冻好再卖给我们。在我们居住那儿的时日里，他总是这样对待我们。
    在我们快要回国前，他一再叮嘱我，在行期确定后告诉他，他要最后一次为我们从卡拉奇弄来最好吃的鱼。后来我觉得不便再给他添麻烦，就没有与他联系。直到现在我心中总觉得未向哈立德这位向我们敞开心扉的朋友告别而感到抱歉呢！
    哈立德说过，“中国人是兄弟”。但愿他能知道，我也怀念他这位巴基斯坦兄弟呢！
