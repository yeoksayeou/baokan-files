    Breakthrough in Mexico's Debt Problem
    Commercial Banks Reduce Mexico's Public Debt by 35%

    Our reporter Guo Weicheng reports from Mexico City on July 23: The Mexican government today reached a historic agreement with international commercial banks to solve the debt problem. The agreement reduces Mexico's $54 billion public debt by 35% and lowers the debt interest rate, fixing it at 6.25%. U.S. Treasury Secretary Brady said that the agreement between Mexico and the creditor banks is the beginning of his plan and a good start for a comprehensive solution to the debt problems of developing countries.

    Mexican President Salinas announced the above agreement to the nation this evening at the National Palace.

    The agreement reduces the principal of the entire public debt by 35%, equivalent to reducing the total debt interest by 40%. It not only fixes the interest rate of the remaining debt at the low level of 6.25%, but also the international commercial banks will provide Mexico with approximately $3 billion in new loans each year for the next four years to help Mexico repay the debt and increase domestic production investment. President Salinas pointed out that this is the "first time in financial history that creditor banks have made such a large concession to a debtor country." "Moreover, what has been achieved is an agreement between a government and 500 different banks on debt." "Mexico is the first debtor country to reach an agreement with creditor banks, setting an example for other countries in debt negotiations."

    墨债务问题有突破
    债务银行削减墨公共债务的35％
    本报墨西哥城7月23日电　记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥政府今天与国际商业银行达成解决债务问题的历史性协议；一举削减墨西哥政府所欠540亿美元公共债务的35％，并把债务利率降低，固定在6.25％。美国财政部长布雷迪说，墨西哥与债权银行达成的协议是他的计划的开始，是全面解决发展中国家的债务问题的良好开端。
    墨西哥总统萨利纳斯今天晚间在国民宫向全国人民宣布了上述协议。
    该协议削减了全部公共债务本金的35％，相当于缩减全部债务利息的40％，不仅把剩余债务的利息率固定在6.25％的低水平上，而且国际商业银行还将在今后4年内每年连续向墨西哥提供约30亿美元的新贷款，帮助墨西哥偿还债务，增加国内生产投资。萨利纳斯总统指出，在世界金融史上，这是“第一次由债权银行向债务国作出这样大的让步”。“而且争取到的是一个政府与500家不同银行之间达成的债务协议”。“墨西哥是世界上债务国中间第一个与债权银行达成协议的国家，这为其它国家进行债务谈判作出了榜样。”
