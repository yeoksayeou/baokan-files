The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army has ordered all military units, especially those stationed in major river basins, to take immediate action and actively participate in flood relief efforts.

The General Political Department issued this directive while forwarding a report on flood relief efforts from a unit stationed in the Jin Hua region of Zhejiang Province. The department emphasized that actively participating in and supporting the people in flood relief efforts is a fundamental characteristic of our army, a duty that the people's military cannot shirk, and a test of the army's construction. Winning the battle against floods is crucial for ensuring a bumper harvest this year, consolidating and developing the achievements of stopping turmoil and suppressing riots, and stabilizing the overall situation.

The General Political Department requires all military units to maintain close contact with local governments, stay informed about flood conditions, and make thorough preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and materials. They must implement all flood relief measures and be ready to rush to the front lines of disaster relief at any moment. Units already engaged in flood relief efforts must take the protection of state property and people's safety as their responsibility, learn from the capital's martial law troops and the "Guardians of the Republic," carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits," overcome all difficulties, and resolutely complete all tasks assigned by their superiors.

    总政要求各部队立即行动
    支援地方抗洪救灾
    据新华社北京7月18日电  解放军总政治部要求全军各部队特别是驻几大水系地区的部队立即行动起来，积极投入抗洪救灾战斗。
    总政治部是在转发驻浙江金华地区某部的抗洪救灾情况报告时提出这个要求的。总政治部指出，积极参加和支援人民群众抗洪救灾，是我军本质的体现，是人民子弟兵义不容辞的责任，是对部队建设的考验。夺取抗洪斗争的胜利，对于保证今年农业生产的全面丰收，对于巩固和发展制止动乱、平息暴乱所取得的胜利成果，稳定大局，具有重要意义。
    总政治部要求各部队同当地政府保持密切联系，及时掌握汛情，做好充分的思想准备、组织准备和物质准备，落实抗洪救灾的各项措施，做到一旦有汛情，立即奔赴救灾第一线。已经投入抗洪的部队，要以保卫国家财产和人民安危为己任，以首都戒严部队和“共和国卫士”为榜样，发扬“五种革命精神”，克服一切困难，坚决完成上级交给的各项任务。
