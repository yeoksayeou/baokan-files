    The Cuban State Council, headed by Castro, unanimously approved the death sentence for four soldiers involved in a drug trafficking case on Sunday evening.

    The official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, Granma, reported yesterday that the 29 members of the State Council unanimously supported the verdict reviewed by the Military Court of the Supreme People's Court.

    The death sentence for Ochoa and the other three soldiers involved in drug trafficking activities was handed down last Friday by a special military court in Cuba. Along with this verdict, 10 other soldiers were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from 10 to 30 years.

    It is believed that after the State Council, chaired by Cuba's top leader Fidel Castro, approves the verdict, Ochoa and the others will be executed by firing squad in the near future.

    本报加拉加斯7月11日电　记者朱满庭报道：以卡斯特罗为首的古巴国务委员会星期日晚上一致批准了对卷入贩毒案件的4名军人的死刑判决。
    古巴共产党中央机关报《格拉玛》昨天报道说，国务委员会的29名成员一致支持最高人民法院军事法庭审核的判决。
    对从事贩毒活动的奥乔亚等4名军人的死刑判决是上星期五由古巴特别军事法庭作出的。与这项判决同时宣判的，还有对另外10名军人监禁10至30年的判决。
