The book "A History of Modern Chinese Economy" authored by Dong Changzhi and Li Fan has been published by Northeast Normal University Press. The authors examine the development of China's social economy from the May Fourth Movement in 1919 to the founding of New China in 1949. The book is divided into six chapters, which respectively discuss:

1. The intensified economic aggression by imperialists against China and the decline of China's social economy from 1919 to 1927.
2. The tortuous development of the social economy during the early period of the Nationalist government.
3. The colonial economy in the areas occupied by Japan.
4. The development and construction of the economy in the rear areas during the War of Resistance.
5. The expansion of bureaucratic capital and the total collapse of the financial economy during the final years of the Nationalist government.
6. The emergence, development, and ultimate victory of the new democratic economy.

The authors focus their investigation on the historical process and level of development of China's capitalist economy during the period of Nationalist rule. I believe that this arrangement is in line with objective facts.

In terms of specific arguments, the book's success lies in its adherence to the spirit of seeking truth from facts and in its presentation of new insights on several issues. Below, I will highlight a few key points.

Regarding the class nature of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang capitalist group and its relationship with the Nanjing Nationalist government, the authors do not consider the Jiangsu-Zhejiang capitalist group to be comprador bourgeoisie. The authors argue that determining whether their representatives belong to the comprador bourgeoisie or the national bourgeoisie cannot be based solely on their background as compradors, but also on their business activities. After analyzing several representative figures, the authors conclude: "The situation of the capitalists in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang capitalist group is quite complex, but from the analysis of several key representatives, it can be generally said: before 1927, they were not comprador bourgeoisie, but upper-class national bourgeoisie. The economy they operated belonged to private capitalism."

Regarding the relationship between this group and the Nanjing Nationalist government, there are different views both domestically and internationally. The authors, on the one hand, based on a large amount of materials, explain that the establishment and consolidation of Chiang Kai-shek's Nanjing government could not have been achieved without the human and material support provided by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang capitalist group. On the other hand, based on sufficient materials, they also explain that the Nanjing government's insatiable demands after its establishment were a source of dissatisfaction for the Jiangsu-Zhejiang capitalist group. The contradictions between the Jiangsu-Zhejiang capitalist group and the Nanjing Nationalist government were developing. The book also analyzes the two-pronged strategy adopted by the Nanjing Nationalist government in dealing with the Jiangsu-Zhejiang bourgeoisie: "On the one hand, it used the super-economic power of the state to suppress; on the other hand, it used small favors to give some benefits."

In summarizing the development of the national economy from 1927 to 1936, the authors use figures to show: "Agricultural economy achieved slow development, and industries, mining, and transportation all saw development." They also point out: "1936 was the peak of economic development in old China." In studying the economic development of these ten years, the authors particularly analyze the Nanjing Nationalist government's efforts to achieve "tariff autonomy." The authors point out both its limitations and the fact that: "The implementation of the tariff autonomy policy not only increased the government's fiscal revenue but also protected China's national market, promoting the development of China's agriculture, industry, and commerce, which has progressive significance and a positive role in the history of China's social and economic development." The authors also devote considerable space to analyzing the fiat currency policy implemented by the Nanjing Nationalist government, pointing out: "The implementation of the fiat currency policy is a major event in the history of modern Chinese currency, with significant meaning and impact." The authors believe: "After the establishment of the Nationalist government, due to the realization of the tariff autonomy policy and the reform of the tax system, due to the abolition of the silver standard and the implementation of the fiat currency policy, the national economy saw significant development." This argument is refreshing and provides valuable insights into understanding the economic situation of that decade.

The authors devote considerable effort to analyzing the economic development of the southwestern and northwestern regions during the War of Resistance. This is a relatively weak area in the field of economic history research. The authors point out: "The state-owned mining and industrial sector in the rear areas developed from almost nothing to 491 enterprises, and the privately-owned mining and industrial sector increased from 237 to 4,319 enterprises." In agriculture, from 1937 to 1942, the average annual growth rates in Sichuan, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou were 36.6% for grain, 15.4% for wheat, and 54.6% for cotton. The significant increase in grain and cotton production ensured the supply for military and civilian needs. The authors also point out: "After 1944, there was a noticeable decline in agriculture in the rear areas."

Another noteworthy aspect of the book is its analysis of China's social economy from 1945 to 1949. For a long time, research on the social economy of these years has been weak, often only focusing on the expansion of bureaucratic capitalism and the total economic collapse. Based on sufficient materials, the authors conclude: "Statistics show that from 1945 to 1949, China's capitalist economy indeed saw significant development." Its characteristics include not only the rapid expansion of bureaucratic capital but also the rapid expansion of private capital. The authors believe that "during this period, China's capitalist economy developed in two directions: bureaucratic capital developed towards monopoly, and private capital developed towards universality. Both aspects saw significant development, and private capital grew faster than bureaucratic capital." "The proportion of capitalist production in the total value of agricultural and industrial production also continued to rise, reaching 23% by 1949."

The book also has some shortcomings, such as the lack of discussion on the economic policies of the Beiyang government and the development of private capital during this period. There is also a lack of analysis of the plundering and mergers of private capital by bureaucratic capital from the end of the War of Resistance to 1949. These shortcomings are hoped to be further revised and supplemented in future editions.

    读《中国现代经济史》
    茅家琦
    董长芝、李帆同志撰著的《中国现代经济史》已由东北师范大学出版社出版。该书作者考察了从1919年五四运动到1949年新中国成立这一段时期中国社会经济发展的过程。全书分为六章，分别叙述：（1）1919年到1927年帝国主义重新加紧对中国的经济侵略和中国社会经济的衰退；（2）国民政府初期社会经济的曲折发展；（3）日本武装占领区的殖民地经济；（4）抗战时期大后方经济的开发和建设；（5）国民政府统治末期官僚资本的膨胀和财政经济的总崩溃；（6）新民主主义经济的产生、发展及其在全国的胜利。作者把考察重点放在国民党统治时期中国资本主义经济发展的历史过程和水平上。我想，这种安排是符合客观事实的。
    从具体论点看，本书的成功之处是贯彻了实事求是的精神，在若干问题上提出新的见解。下面重点介绍几个问题。
    关于江浙资本集团的阶级属性和它与南京国民政府的关系问题。本书作者不认为江浙资本集团属于买办资产阶级。作者认为确定它的代表人物属于买办资产阶级还是民族资产阶级，不能只看他们当过买办的出身，而且要看他们的经营活动。作者在具体分析若干代表人物以后作出判断：“江浙资本集团资本家的情况是相当复杂的，但从几个主要代表人物分析，基本上可以说：1927年前，他们不是大买办资产阶级，而是上层民族资产阶级。他们所经营的经济属于民营资本主义”。
    关于这个集团与国民党南京政权的关系，海内外存在不同的看法。本书作者，一方面根据大量的资料，说明蒋介石南京政府的建立和巩固与江浙资本集团给予的人力和物力支持分不开；同时，又根据充分的资料，说明南京政府成立后，江浙资本集团对它的贪得无厌的索取又是不满的。江浙资本集团和南京国民政府的矛盾在发展。本书又分析南京
  国民政府对付江浙资产阶级所采取的两手策略：“一方面利用国家政权的超经济力量压服；另一方面利用小恩小惠给点好处”。
    作者在总结1927—1936年十年间国民经济发展时用数字表明：“农业经济得到缓慢发展、工矿交通运输业均有发展”，并且指出：“1936年是旧中国经济发展的最高峰”。在研究这十年经济发展时，作者特别分析了南京国民政府争取“关税自主”的努力。作者既指出它的局限性，也指出：“关税自主政策的实施不仅增加了政府的财政收入，而且保护了中国的民族市场，促进了中国农工商业的发展，在中国社会经济发展史上具有进步意义和积极作用”。作者还用较多篇幅分析了南京国民政府实施的法币政策，指出：“实施法币政策是中国近代货币史上一件大事，其意义和影响是重大的”。作者认为：“国民政府成立后，由于实现了关税自主政策和税收制度的改革，由于废两改元和法币政策的实施，国民经济得到了很大发展”。这种论点，令读者耳目一新，对认识这十年的经济状况是很有启发的。
    作者用很大力量分析抗战时期西南、西北地区经济的发展。在经济史研究领域内，这是一个比较薄弱的方面。作者指出：“大后方的国营工矿业几乎从无到有，发展到491家，民营工矿业，从237家增加到4319家”。在农业方面，从1937年到1942年的五年中，川、桂、滇、黔四省，每年平均增长率，谷为36.6％，麦为15.4％，棉为54.6％。粮棉产量的大幅度增长为供应军需民用提供了保证。作者同时也指出：1944年以后，大后方农业有明显的衰退。
    本书另一个引人注意的地方是对1945—1949年间中国社会经济的分析。在很长的一个时期以内，人们对这几年社会经济的研究也是薄弱的，往往只看到官僚资本主义的膨胀、经济的总崩溃。作者根据充分的资料得出下列结论：“据统计，1945—1949年间，中国的资本主义经济确实获得了大发展”。其特点不仅是官僚资本急剧膨胀，而且包括民营资本迅速扩展”。作者认为，“这个期间，中国的资本主义向两个方向发展，官僚资本向垄断方面发展，民营资本向普及方面发展，这两个方面都获得了大发展，而且是民营资本快于官僚资本”；“资本主义生产在工农业生产总值中所占的比重也不断提高，到1949年已达23％”。
    本书也有缺点，例如，对北洋政府的经济政策以及这一时期民营资本的发展缺少论述；对抗战末期到1949年官僚资本对民营资本的掠夺和兼并也缺少分析。这些缺点希望在再版时能得到进一步修改和补充。
