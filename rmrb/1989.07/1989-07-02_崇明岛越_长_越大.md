Chongming Island, located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, is China's third-largest island. Over the past 40 years, it has expanded by 495 square kilometers, growing at an average rate of 12.4 square kilometers per year.

Currently, there are approximately 420,000 acres of tidal flats on Chongming Island that have not yet been reclaimed. The Yangtze River continues to carry about 500 million cubic meters of silt annually. As these tidal flats continue to accumulate sediment, the area of Chongming Island will continue to expand year by year.

    崇明岛越“长”越大
    新华社上海电　（记者陆国元）位于长江入海口的我国第三大岛崇明岛，近40年新增面积495平方公里，平均每年“长”出12.4平方公里。
    崇明岛现在约有42万亩滩涂尚未围垦，长江每年仍挟带大约5亿立方米泥沙滔滔而来。随着这些滩涂的不断淤积，崇明岛的面积还将逐年扩大。
