	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 28th.

	The National Research Council, a U.S. private research institution, released a lengthy report titled "Blacks and American Society" yesterday. The report points out that while the conditions of African Americans have improved significantly over the past 50 years, they still lag far behind whites in various aspects of social life. Therefore, eliminating these serious inequalities remains an "unfinished agenda" and a challenge for the United States.

	The report states that since the 1970s, the economic status of African Americans has not improved and has even declined. The poverty rate among African Americans is 2 to 3 times higher than that of whites. The unemployment rate is twice as high, and the proportion of low-income African American families with annual incomes below $10,000 increased from 26% in 1970 to 30% in 1980. The average wages of African Americans are significantly lower than those of whites.

	The report notes that African Americans do not have equal opportunities to receive education. In schools predominantly attended by African American students, the quality of teachers and facilities is often inferior. Since the mid-1970s, the proportion of African Americans attending college has decreased, and the high school dropout rate is twice that of whites. In primary and secondary schools, racial segregation and discrimination against African American students are prevalent.

	The report states that the mortality and morbidity rates among African Americans are higher than those of whites, and the infant mortality rate is twice as high. Among those under 65, 22% of African Americans lack medical insurance, compared to 14% of whites.

	The report believes that African Americans face varying degrees of discrimination in employment, education, housing, and other areas. In large cities, African American neighborhoods are distinctly separate from white neighborhoods. In 1988, there were 6,800 African American elected officials at the federal, state, and local levels, accounting for only 1.5% of the total number of elected officials nationwide, which is clearly disproportionate to the African American population. These racial discriminations are the main obstacles to further improving the conditions of African Americans. The report predicts that "in the foreseeable future, it will be impossible to fully integrate African Americans into a 'color-blind society' (a society without racial discrimination)."

	This research report has been published and is 608 pages long. It was written by 22 researchers from the National Research Council and 18 other experts after several years of in-depth investigation and research. It is highly authoritative and has received attention from sociologists in the United States.

### 美全国研究委员会报告指出  美国黑人境况依然窘迫

    美全国研究委员会报告指出
    美国黑人境况依然窘迫
    本报华盛顿7月28日电　记者张亮报道：美国一家民间研究机构——“全国研究委员会”昨天发表一份题为《黑人与美国社会》的长篇研究报告指出，美国黑人的境况在过去50年中有很大改善，但是在社会生活的各个方面仍然与白人相差甚远。因此，如何消除这些严重的不平等是美国面临的一个“尚未完成的议事日程”和挑战。
    报告说，70年代以来黑人的经济地位没有改善甚至下降了。黑人贫困率是白人的2倍至3倍，失业率是白人的2倍，年收入在1万美元以下的低收入黑人家庭的比例从1970年的26％上升到1980年的30％。黑人的平均工资大大低于白人。
    报告指出，黑人与白人享受教育的机会不平等。在以黑人学生为主的学校里，师资质量及设备往往较差。70年代中期以来，黑人上大学的比例下降，高中生辍学率是白人的2倍，在中小学校，种族隔离和对黑人学生另眼相看的现象普遍存在。
    据告说，黑人的死亡率和发病率高于白人，婴儿死亡率是白人的2倍。65岁以下的人中，22％的黑人没有医疗保险，而白人的比例则为14％。
    报告认为，黑人在就业、教育、住房等问题上也受到不同程度的歧视。在大城市，黑人区与白人区截然分离。1988年联邦、州和地方各级政府的当选官员中有6800名黑人，只占全国当选官员总数的1.5％，显然与黑人人口的比例极不相称。这些种族歧视正是进一步改善黑人境况的主要障碍。报告预测，“在可预见的将来，不可能把黑人完全同化在一个‘色盲社会’（即没有种族歧视的社会）。”
    这份研究报告已出版，全书长达608页。是由“全国研究委员会”的22名研究员和另外18名专家在经过几年深入调查研究的基础上撰写的，具有很大权威性，并受到了此间社会学家的重视。
