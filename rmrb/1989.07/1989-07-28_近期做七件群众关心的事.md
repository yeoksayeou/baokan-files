The Political Bureau of the Central Committee held a plenary meeting in Beijing on July 27 and 28, discussing and approving the "Decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on Addressing Several Matters of Concern to the Public in the Near Future" and the "Notice by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Propaganda and Ideological Work."

The meeting noted that since the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the overall situation in the country has further stabilized, and the four major tasks proposed by the plenary session are being implemented. Currently, it is urgent to address several matters that the public is generally concerned about. Resolutely combating corruption, leading by example in being clean and diligent, and working hard are matters that the public is generally concerned about. The Central Committee and the State Council have decided to address seven matters in this regard in the near future; requirements for leading cadres will first be applied to the leading comrades of the Central Committee and the State Council. This is of great significance for boosting morale and ensuring that our Party and the cause of reform, opening up, and modernization led by our Party remain invincible.

The seven matters that the Central Committee and the State Council have decided to address in the near future are:

1. Further cleaning up and rectifying companies. The focus is on eliminating the excessive and rampant companies in the circulation sector that engage in commercial, foreign trade, and material supply activities, as well as financial companies. The cleanup and rectification work will start with companies under the State Council. It has been decided to dissolve the Kanghua Development Corporation and the China Industrial and Commercial Development Corporation, with some of their businesses transferred to relevant departments for handling; the China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation will be merged into the National Agricultural Investment Corporation. The audit results of these companies, as well as the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and the Bright China Industrial Corporation, will be promptly disclosed to the public.

2. Resolutely stopping the children of high-ranking officials from engaging in business. This will start with the members of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and the members of the Standing Committee of the State Council. Their spouses, children, and their spouses are not allowed to engage in business activities in the circulation sector; they are not allowed to hold positions or part-time positions in companies in the circulation sector, and those who do must resign by September 1, 1989, and be reassigned to other jobs. Leading comrades are not allowed to use their power to provide any convenient conditions for their relatives to engage in business.

3. Canceling the "special supply" of a small amount of food for leading comrades. All food items at fixed supply points will be supplied at market prices and in the same quantities as for the general public; prices and business operations will be supervised by the price and industrial and commercial departments.

4. Strictly adhering to regulations for vehicle allocation and strictly prohibiting the import of passenger cars (except for government-to-government long-term trade agreements already signed and national-approved technology trade contracts). Members of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and the members of the Standing Committee of the State Council will use domestically produced cars. Other leading comrades will, as far as possible, continue to use their existing vehicles and avoid creating new waste.

5. Strictly prohibiting banquets and gifts. Members of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee, and the members of the Standing Committee of the State Council are not allowed to use public funds to entertain domestic guests; when visiting subordinate units and grassroots levels, they must eat working meals, and the standards for working meals must be strictly regulated and enforced, and they must not accept gifts of local specialties and other items.

6. Strictly controlling the overseas trips of leading cadres. Strictly enforce all regulations regarding overseas trips. Provincial and ministerial-level leading cadres going on visits must be for the performance of their official duties or work visits, and they are not allowed to accept invitations from foreign businesses and overseas Chinese-funded enterprises to visit, nor are they allowed to use the pretext of inspection to visit places that are not necessary for their official duties or that are not commensurate with their rank and status.

7. Seriously and thoroughly investigating and dealing with cases of embezzlement, bribery, speculation, and profiteering, especially focusing on major cases. The principle of equality before the law must be upheld, and anyone who deserves punishment according to the law, regardless of who they are, must be punished. Currently, to give those who have committed acts of embezzlement, bribery, and speculation and profiteering a chance to repent and reform, and to more effectively combat serious economic crimes, it is necessary to set a unified deadline. Within this deadline, those who confess and voluntarily return the ill-gotten gains will be punished lightly, reduced in sentence, or exempted from punishment according to the law; otherwise, they will be severely punished according to the law. It is suggested that the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate issue specific judicial interpretations based on relevant laws. Those who intervene, cover up, and protect during the investigation process will be publicly exposed and seriously dealt with.

Some of the above seven matters will be implemented immediately; others will be entrusted to relevant departments to promptly formulate implementation rules, which will be executed after approval by the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau or the State Council. The meeting requires that all regions and departments, based on the spirit of the above "Decision" by the Central Committee, formulate specific regulations in combination with their actual situations.

The meeting also discussed the "Notice by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Strengthening Propaganda and Ideological Work." This document was produced after multiple discussions and revisions based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The guiding principles, fundamental tasks, and work arrangements for propaganda and ideological work proposed in the "Notice" should be seriously implemented by party committees at all levels in combination with actual situations. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership over propaganda and ideological work, resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization, and truly occupy the ideological front with socialist ideology, making positive contributions to stabilizing the situation, developing the economy, and promoting other work across the board.

13 members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee and 1 alternate member attended the meeting. 1 member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee was absent due to official duties. 10 vice chairmen of the Central Advisory Commission, members of the Secretariat of the Central Committee, members of the Standing Committee of the State Council, and responsible comrades from relevant departments attended the meeting as non-voting participants.

The meeting was presided over by Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee.

The meeting called on all party members, especially leading cadres at all levels, to strive to carry forward the fine traditions and style of the Party, regard the cause of the Party as their own responsibility, and with their practical actions, strengthen the ties between the Party and the people, and continue to complete the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and work hard for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

    新华社北京7月28日电　中共中央政治局于7月27日和28日在北京举行全体会议，讨论并通过了《中共中央、国务院关于近期做几件群众关心的事的决定》和《中共中央关于加强宣传、思想工作的通知》。
    会议认为，党的十三届四中全会以来，全国形势进一步稳定，全会提出的四件大事正在抓紧落实。当前，迫切需要做好几件人民群众普遍关心的事情。坚决惩治腐败，带头廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗，就是人民群众普遍关心的事情。党中央、国务院决定，近期在这方面先做七件事；涉及对领导干部的要求，首先从党中央和国务院的领导同志做起。这对于振奋党心民心，保证我们的党和党所领导的改革开放与现代化建设事业立于不败之地，具有重要的意义。
    党中央、国务院决定近期要做的七件事是：
    一、进一步清理整顿公司。重点是砍掉流通领域中过多、过滥的从事商业、外贸、物资供应的公司和金融性公司。清理整顿工作，首先从国务院所属公司做起，决定撤销康华发展总公司和中国工商经济开发公司，其中有的业务移交有关部门处理；中国农村信托投资公司并入国家农业投资公司。对这几家公司以及中国国际信托投资公司、光大实业公司的审计情况，将尽快向社会公布。
    二、坚决制止高干子女经商。这件事首先从中央政治局、书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员做起，实行回避政策，他们的配偶、子女及其配偶，不得从事流通领域的经营活动；不得在流通领域的公司任职、兼职，凡有任职、兼职的，必须限期于1989年9月1日前退出，另行安排工作。领导同志不得利用职权为其亲友经商提供任何方便条件。
    三、取消对领导同志少量食品的“特供”。固定供应点的所有食品一律按市价和市民定量供应；价格及经营业务接受物价、工商部门的监督。
    四、严格按规定配车，严格禁止进口小轿车（执行政府间已签订的长期贸易协定和国家批准的技术贸易合同除外）。中央政治局、书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员，一律使用国产车。其他领导人根据实际情况尽可能仍使用现有车辆，不要造成新的浪费。
    五、严格禁止请客送礼。中央政治局、书记处成员和国务院常务会议组成人员，不准用公款宴请内客；到下级单位和基层，一律吃工作餐，工作餐的标准要严格规定并严格执行，不得接受馈赠的土特产品及其它物品。
    六、严格控制领导干部出国。严格执行关于出国的各项规定。省、部以上领导干部出访，必须是为执行其主管公务的国事或工作访问，不得接受外商和境外中资企业的邀请出访，不得以考察为名进行非其主管公务所必须的、与其职级身份不相称的出访。
    七、严肃认真地查处贪污、受贿、投机倒把等犯罪案件，特别要抓紧查处大案要案。必须坚持公民在法律面前一律平等的原则，凡依法该受惩罚的，不管是谁，一律受惩罚。当前，为了给犯有贪污、受贿、投机倒把行为的人一个悔过自新的机会，更有力地打击严重经济犯罪活动，有必要规定统一的期限，在这个期限内坦白自首、积极退赃者，依法从轻、减轻或免于处罚；否则，依法从严惩处。建议由最高人民法院和最高人民检察院根据有关法律，发布具体司法解释。对办案过程中说情袒护、徇私包庇者，要公开揭露，严肃处理。
    以上七件事，有的立即照此执行；有的责成有关部门尽快制订实施细则，报政治局常委会或国务院批准后执行。会议要求，各地区、各部门应根据中央上述《决定》的精神，结合自己的实际情况，确定要做好的事情并作出具体规定。
    会议还对《中共中央关于加强宣传、思想工作的通知》作了讨论。这个文件是根据十三届四中全会精神，经过多次讨论、修改的基础上产生的。《通知》提出的宣传、思想工作的指导方针、根本任务和工作部署，各级党委要结合实际情况认真贯彻执行。要大力加强对宣传、思想工作的领导，切实反对资产阶级自由化，真正让社会主义思想占领意识形态阵地，为稳定局势、发展经济和推动全局其它工作作出积极贡献。
    中共中央政治局委员13人、中央政治局候补委员1人出席了会议，中央政治局委员1人因公缺席。中共中央顾问委员会副主任、中共中央书记处成员、国务院常务会议组成人员及有关方面负责同志10人列席了会议。
    中共中央总书记江泽民主持了会议。
    会议号召，全党同志特别是各级领导干部，要努力发扬党的优良传统和作风，以党的事业为己任，用自己的实际行动密切党群关系，继续为完成十三届四中全会提出的各项任务，为建设有中国特色的社会主义而艰苦奋斗。（附图片）
