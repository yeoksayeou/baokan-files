Taipei News: A delegation from the Taiwanese computer industry will depart for Beijing on July 29th to discuss the unification of Chinese language computers with mainland computer industry representatives. This will facilitate information exchange between the two sides.

In early April of this year, Taiwanese computer industry representatives met with their mainland counterparts in Hong Kong for the first time. They decided to establish a joint technical working group, which includes four sub-groups focusing on the unification of Chinese computer character codes, Chinese fonts, Chinese input methods, and Chinese computer terminology. These efforts aim to promote the unification of Chinese language computers.

The Taiwanese computer industry representatives will also observe the mainland's Chinese font editing operations and demonstrate the mainland's Chinese input methods. They are expected to stay in Beijing for one week.
