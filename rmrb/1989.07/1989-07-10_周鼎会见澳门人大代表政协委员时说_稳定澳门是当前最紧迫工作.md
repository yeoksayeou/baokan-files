Zhou Ding, head of the Xinhua News Agency's Macau branch, pointed out that adhering to the principle of "one country, two systems" and maintaining normal relations between Macau and the mainland is in the common interest of Macau compatriots and the people of the entire country. The most urgent task at present is to stabilize Macau and seek development in stability.

Zhou Ding made these remarks this afternoon during a meeting with national and provincial people's congress deputies and CPPCC members from Macau.

At the meeting, Deputy Head Hu Chucheng briefed the attendees on recent speeches by Deng Xiaoping and other central leaders. These speeches analyzed the situation, nature, and causes of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, and outlined the party and government's future policies and guidelines.

In his speech, Zhou Ding stated, "The 'one country, two systems' policy was personally initiated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and formulated by the Chinese government, and has been confirmed through the solemn international agreement of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration. The Chinese government will definitely uphold the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration and will not change Macau's capitalist system, nor will it turn 'two systems' into 'one system.'"

He said, "Although we may have different views on some issues, we have a fundamental common point, which is that we all love our country and love Macau, and we all hope that Macau can achieve long-term stability, development, and prosperity."

Zhou Ding believes that an important factor in stabilizing Macau is stabilizing its economy. He said that Macau's current economic situation is good, and the difficulties encountered in some areas are temporary and can be overcome. As long as several major construction projects proceed smoothly, the investment environment is further improved, existing economic potential is tapped, cooperation between Macau and the mainland is strengthened, and Hong Kong, Taiwanese, and foreign capital are actively introduced, efforts are made to develop real industries, Macau's economy will show new vitality.

    周鼎会见澳门人大代表政协委员时说
    稳定澳门是当前最紧迫工作
    新华社澳门7月10日电　新华社澳门分社社长周鼎指出，坚持“一国两制”，维护澳门与内地的正常关系，是澳门同胞和全国人民的共同利益。当前最紧迫的工作是稳定澳门，并在稳定中求发展。
    周鼎是今天下午同澳门地区的全国和省人大代表、政协委员进行座谈时说这番话的。
    在座谈会上，副社长胡厚诚向与会的人大代表、政协委员通报了邓小平等中央领导人最近的几次讲话。这些讲话对北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的情况、性质和原因作了分析，并阐明了党和政府今后的方针政策。
    周鼎在讲话中表示，“一国两制”是邓小平同志亲自倡导、由中国政府制定的国策，并经过《中葡联合声明》这一庄严的国际协议予以确认。中国政府一定会信守《中葡联合声明》，决不会改变澳门的资本主义制度，决不会把“两制”变成“一制”。
    他说，尽管大家对一些问题有这样那样的不同看法，但我们有一个根本的共同点，就是大家都热爱祖国、热爱澳门，大家都希望澳门能够长期稳定、发展和繁荣。
    周鼎认为，稳定澳门的一个重要因素是稳定澳门的经济。他说，目前澳门的经济情况是好的，某些方面遇到的困难是暂时的，是可以克服的。只要几项大型工程建设顺利进行，进一步改善投资环境，挖掘现有的经济潜力，继续加强澳门同内地的经济合作，积极引进港资、台资和外资，努力发展实业，澳门的经济就会出现新的活力。
