In October 1980, during the golden autumn of northern China, at the National Light Industry Products Ordering Conference held in Handan, Hebei, a young man dressed modestly with a slight accent from Guanzhong, quickly opened bags of milk powder, made cups of fragrant hot milk, and respectfully handed them to the customers: "Please try the Lintong Terracotta Warrior brand full-fat milk powder. If you like it, place an order. If not, that's fine too. We welcome your feedback!" The customers, tasting the rich and delicious milk, couldn't help but praise: "This milk powder tastes great!" On the spot, they signed a supply contract for 180 tons.

This humble young man is Liu Huaiguo, a member of the Communist Party and the current director of the factory.

Liu Huaiguo returned to Lintong countryside from the army in 1979. At that time, he saw his fellow villagers raising sheep but struggling to sell fresh milk. "Sheep milk sustains the people's daily needs!" Liu Huaiguo decided to create a path to prosperity for his fellow villagers by developing the sheep dairy industry.

After conducting surveys, Liu Huaiguo decided to establish a sheep milk processing factory first. The local leaders supported him, allocating 2,000 yuan and five mu of land. He and his partners started construction while mobilizing farmers to raise more sheep. By the time of production, he had secured a milk source from over 5,000 sheep. Liu Huaiguo pressed on, purchasing vacuum and concentration equipment to build a spray-drying workshop. In the spring of 1980, the factory produced its first batch of milk powder. To further expand the milk supply, he decided to develop dairy cows.

Everything is difficult at the beginning. The villagers, who had never seen a dairy cow, who would dare to spend a thousand or two yuan on such a "risky" venture? Liu Huaiguo decided to start with the "experts." He found the shrewd old accountant Sun Shihua and proactively lent him 1,000 yuan from the factory to raise a dairy cow in Xiangqiao Village, a pioneering effort.

Sun Shihua succeeded. Raising dairy cows was much more profitable than raising dairy sheep. The villagers were envious. Liu Huaiguo, seizing the opportunity, borrowed 120 million yuan from the bank to purchase over 1,500 high-quality dairy cows, which were then raised by the villagers, quickly forming a dairy cow base and promoting the enterprise to "deep roots and lush leaves."

In 1986, Liu Huaiguo officially became the director of Xiangqiao Dairy Factory. To motivate the enthusiasm of the enterprise's employees, he signed contract management agreements with multiple departments within the factory. High-quality management resulted in high-quality products. In 1987, their "Terracotta Warrior" full-fat sweetened cow and sheep milk powder won the National Agricultural and Pastoral Fishery Department's Excellent Product Award. This year, they "reached new heights": the Terracotta Warrior full-fat sheep milk powder won a gold medal at the first China Food Expo, and the Terracotta Warrior full-fat cow milk powder won the gold award for the first China High-Quality Health Products! The products are not only sold in 24 provinces and cities across the country but are also exported to Eastern European countries.

    根深叶茂
    ——记临潼相桥乳品厂厂长刘华国
    本报记者  孟西安
    一九八○年十月，北国的金秋季节，在河北邯郸举行的全国轻工产品订货会上，一位着装朴素，带着几分关中口音的青年人，敏捷地打开奶粉袋，冲下一杯杯香喷喷的热奶，恭恭敬敬地递给客户们：“请尝尝临潼秦俑牌全脂奶粉，好了订货，不合口味，不订也没啥，欢迎提意见！”客户们品尝着浓香可口的奶汁，不禁连连夸奖：“这奶粉味道不错！”当下，大家签了一百八十吨的供货合同。
    这位憨厚的年轻人，就是共产党员，现任厂长刘华国。
    刘华国是一九七九年从部队复员回到临潼农村的。当时，他看到乡亲们纷纷养羊，但又为交鲜奶发愁。“羊奶维系着群众的油盐酱醋啊！”刘华国决心为乡亲们创出发“羊财”的致富之路。
    经过走访调查，刘华国决定先办一个羊奶炼乳厂。当时的乡领导支持他，拨给他二千元并划了五亩地。他和伙伴们一边搞基建，一边动员农民发展山羊。到投产那天，他已拥有了五千多只羊的奶源基地。刘华国一鼓作气，购回真空、浓缩设备，建起了喷粉车间。一九八○年春，该厂终于生产出第一批奶粉。为充实奶源，他决定发展奶牛。
    万事开头难。连奶牛都没有见过的乡亲们，谁敢掏一两千元买“风险”？刘华国决定先从“能人”身上打开缺口。他找到精明的老会计孙世华，并主动从厂里给其贷款一千元，在相桥农村，破天荒地养了一头奶牛。
    孙世华成功了。养奶牛比养奶山羊收益高得多。乡亲们“眼馋”了。刘华国雪中送炭，从银行贷款一百二十多万元，先后买回一千五百多头良种奶牛，交群众饲养，迅速形成奶牛基地，促使企业“根深叶茂”。
    一九八六年，刘华国正式担任了相桥乳品厂厂长。为了调动企业职工的积极性，他与厂内多个部门签订了承包合同；高质量的管理换来高质量的产品。一九八七年，他们生产的“秦俑牌”全脂加糖牛羊奶粉荣获了国家农牧渔业部优质产品奖。今年“更上一层楼”，秦俑牌全脂羊奶粉荣获首届中国食品博览会一枚金牌，秦俑牌全脂牛奶粉获首届中国优质保健产品金奖！产品不仅销售到国内二十四个省市，而且远销东欧各国。
