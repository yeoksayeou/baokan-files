Baron Elected President of the European Parliament

Our reporter Wei Wei reports from Brussels: On the 25th, the European Parliament in Strasbourg elected a new president. Enrique Baron, a 45-year-old member of the Spanish Socialist Party, was elected unopposed in the first round of voting.

Out of 518 members, 475 participated in the voting, with Baron receiving 301 votes. According to local media reports, among the six candidates, Baron easily won due to a pre-election deal between the two largest parliamentary groups, the Christian Democratic Party and the Socialist Party. This time, the former supported the latter; in two and a half years, after the Socialist has completed their term, the latter will support the former's candidacy. The two groups have 121 and 180 seats respectively. Therefore, their combined efforts ensure a stable victory.

In his brief speech after the election, Baron pledged to dedicate himself to European construction, stating that a "unified, democratic Europe should be an open Europe to the world." Regarding strengthening European construction, according to local media reports, he advocates for enhancing the power of the European Parliament and increasing its ability to constrain the European Council and the Commission. By "open to the world," he primarily means using "parliamentary democracy" to influence changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, as well as using "human rights" to address global issues.

    巴龙当选欧洲议会议长
    本报布鲁塞尔7月26日电  记者魏崴报道：25日欧洲议会于斯特拉斯堡选出新议长。现年45岁、属西班牙社会党的恩里克·巴龙在首轮投票中顺利当选。
    总数为518名议员中，参加投票的共475人，巴龙得301票。据此间新闻界透露，在6名竞选者中他能轻易夺魁，是因为欧洲议会中的两个最大党团，基督教民主党和社会党于选举前作了交易。这回选举，前者支持后者；待两年半后，即社会党人当了议长满任后，后者再支持前者竞选。这两个党团的议席分别为121和180。因而，它们联手，可稳操胜券。
    在选举之后发表的简短致词中，巴龙表示将致力于欧洲建设，声称一个“统一的、民主的欧洲应当是对世界开放的欧洲”。关于加强欧洲建设，据此间舆论界报道，他主张加强欧洲议会的权力，对欧共体理事会和委员会增加制约能力；所谓“对世界开放”，他指的主要是用“议会民主”去影响苏联和东欧的变化，以及用“人权”去过问世界事务。
