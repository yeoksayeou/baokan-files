Title: Analyzing "I Have Responsibility"

It was reported that a classroom in a certain school collapsed, resulting in the tragic deaths of more than a dozen students. The head of the education bureau in charge merely said, "I have responsibility," and that was considered an explanation.

Looking around, this phenomenon is not uncommon. Whenever there are mistakes in work or serious problems arise, some leaders often say, "Such problems have occurred, and I have responsibility." "I have responsibility" — is this taking responsibility or seeking to evade it?

Every job requires clear responsibilities. Once a mistake occurs, holding someone accountable is only natural. Since the leader has responsibility, can we straightforwardly hold the leader accountable? Hold on! "I bear the responsibility of leadership," "I bear the responsibility of education," "I bear the responsibility of..." — each phrase shifts the blame to the lightest possible interpretation, until major issues are reduced to minor ones, and minor issues are dismissed. You can no longer hold the leader accountable. It seems that leaders can only abstractly, not concretely, bear responsibility. If we pierce the window paper, "I have responsibility" becomes a synonym for "I have no responsibility."

In the current rectification and cleanup efforts, this phenomenon is undoubtedly also being addressed. I hope that "I have responsibility" can be given real substance and not become an empty phrase to avoid any responsibility, thus disappointing the people.

    “我有责任”析疑
    伊恒
    报载：某校教室倒塌，十几名学生无辜丧生，主管教育的局领导说声“我有责任”就算交代了。
    环顾四周，这种现象并非少见。每当工作出现失误或发生严重问题，一些领导总爱说：“出现这样的问题我有责任。”“我有责任”，是引咎自责，还是寻求解脱？
    干什么工作都要责任分明。一旦出现纰漏，追究责任，理所当然。既然领导有责任，能不能理直气壮地追究领导的责任？且慢！“我负有领导的责任”、“我负有教育的责任”、“我负有……”句句往最轻处说，直到大事化小，小事化了，你还追究领导什么呢？看来，领导只能抽象而不能具体地承担责任。把窗户纸戳透，“我有责任”成了“我没责任”的同义语。
    在当前的治理整顿中，这种现象想必也在整顿之列。但愿“我有责任”能够赋予它以实质性内容，千万不要成为不负任何责任的口头禅，以泄了百姓的气。
