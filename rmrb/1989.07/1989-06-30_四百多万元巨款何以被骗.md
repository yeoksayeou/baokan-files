44 million yuan was swindled, and this is no small amount. However, because this large sum of money belonged to the state, in the eyes of some people, it seemed to lose its value. Consider the following case that occurred in Changsha, Hunan Province.

**Signing Contracts Without a Source of Goods**

In May 1988, the Sanhe Company, which was affiliated with the Hunan Provincial Economic Development Promotion Association, officially opened for business. This company, which had only 15 employees, immediately displayed unusual activities. Some people went out on business, not only using the name of a provincial-level organization but also invoking the names of relevant leaders, actively networking. Inside the company, management was chaotic, and some people could freely withdraw cash and set up private accounts. The company's chairman and manager received daily subsidies of 50 yuan each when traveling within the province and 100 yuan each when traveling outside the province. Within four to five months of its establishment, the Sanhe Company had spent over 30 million yuan on various expenses, including 5.2 million yuan on travel expenses and 20 million yuan on personal misuse of funds.

In July 1988, Sanhe Company Chairman Quan Shouyan suddenly called Hunan Provincial Commercial and Trade Company Manager Yang Jiancheng, asking him to help sell 5,000 tons of aluminum ingots. Aluminum ingots were in high demand in the domestic market at the time, so Yang Jiancheng was happy to oblige. He immediately informed the relevant personnel of the Hunan Electric Equipment Industry Company, who were eager to obtain aluminum ingots. However, the other party was concerned that Sanhe Company might be fraudulent and did not want to do business directly with Sanhe Company. Therefore, Yang Jiancheng decided to act as a "middleman."

On July 25, the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company signed a joint venture agreement with Sanhe Company for 5,000 tons of aluminum ingots. The agreement stated: Sanhe Company would organize the supply of goods, and the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company would be responsible for sales.

In reality, there was no source of goods.

**The Swindler Baits, and the Victims Take the Hook**

On July 26, the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company signed a contract with the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company to sell 5,000 tons of aluminum ingots to the Electric Company at a price of 11,000 yuan per ton.

On July 28, the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company resold 3,000 tons of aluminum ingots to the Hunan Provincial Metallurgical Industry Corporation's Business Development Department at a price of 11,800 yuan per ton, and both parties signed a contract. Subsequently, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Corporation's Business Development Department sold 1,000 tons of aluminum ingots from the contract to the Hunan Branch of the China Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corporation. Both parties also signed a contract.

By the end of July, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Corporation's Business Development Department and another unit remitted 44 million yuan to the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company for the goods.

A few days later, the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company received this large sum of money. According to the agreement, they retained 5.3 million yuan for their own use and transferred the remaining 38.7 million yuan to Sanhe Company. After receiving this money, Sanhe Company used part of it for their own purposes, part to repay debts, pay compensation, and part to do business.

After the 44 million yuan was remitted to Sanhe Company and the Hunan Provincial Commercial and Trade Company, the 5,000 tons of aluminum ingots were nowhere to be found. Therefore, the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Corporation's Business Development Department urged the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company for the aluminum ingots, the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company urged the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company for the goods, and the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company urged Sanhe Company for the goods. After much urging, most people realized they had been deceived by Sanhe Company. The demand for goods then turned into a demand for the money. However, Sanhe Company had almost spent all of the money.

**Eagerness for Profit Leads to Loss of Vigilance**

The companies that were deceived had all made rosy calculations: if this easy aluminum ingot deal went through, the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company could make a profit of 5 million yuan, the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company could make a profit of over 200 million yuan, and the Provincial Metallurgical Industry Corporation's Business Development Department could also make a profit of 20 million yuan. Therefore, these few purchasing units did not verify the source of the goods but blindly signed the contracts and paid the large sum of money. Why did a single phone call from Sanhe Company cause several units to be deceived? When asked this question, the response was surprisingly consistent: "The other party is a provincial-level company with a big company's reputation, we believe them." Some people even said, "The contract clearly states the relevant clauses, so we were at ease." The person in charge of the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company had written two letters to the company's leaders, stating that if there were any problems with the aluminum ingot contract, he would take full responsibility. Now, what responsibility should he take?

The desire for profit made some people dizzy, and even if there were flaws in the aluminum ingot contract, and the swindlers showed their tails, it did not alert the relevant personnel. For example, after the Provincial Commercial and Trade Company signed the agreement with Sanhe Company, two colleagues advised Yang Jiancheng not to do this business. They believed that the price of this batch of aluminum ingots was much lower than the market price at that time, which was very suspicious; Sanhe Company Chairman Quan Shouyan said the supplier was in Shenzhen, but many units in Shenzhen needed aluminum ingots, so why would the Shenzhen supplier promote aluminum ingots to Hunan? To this, Yang Jiancheng not only did not think calmly but also wanted to expel these two colleagues from the company.

After Sanhe Company swindled 38.7 million yuan, in August 1988, Liang Baiquan and others from the Provincial Electric Equipment Industry Company made an appointment with Sanhe Company Chairman Quan Shouyan to go to Qiqihar, Heilongjiang Province, to inspect the goods. Liang Baiquan and others waited there for more than 20 days without seeing Quan Shouyan, let alone inspecting the goods. At this point, someone with a bit of vigilance could see the problem. Surprisingly, Liang Baiquan and others still insisted on getting the aluminum ingots because the price of aluminum ingots had risen again. What lessons should people learn from this case of a large sum of money being swindled?

Currently, the Changsha Municipal People's Procuratorate is investigating this case of swindling a large sum of money.

### 四百多万元巨款何以被骗

    四百多万元巨款何以被骗
    本报记者　董纪新
    440万元被骗，这可不是一个小数目。然而，由于这笔巨款是属于国家的，在某些人的眼里它却变得不那么值钱了。请看发生在湖南长沙市的这起骗案。
    签订合同　没有货源
    1988年5月，挂靠在湖南省经济建设促进会的三和公司正式开业了。这家只有15个工作人员的公司一出台，就显示出不同寻常的举动。有的人外出做生意，不仅打出湖南省级机关的牌子，还打出有关领导人的旗号，四处活动。在公司内部，管理十分混乱，一些人可以随便支取现金、私设帐号。公司董事长和经理出差时，省内每天每人补助50元，省外每天每人补助100元。三和公司成立四五个月后，各种费用开支达30多万元，其中旅差费达5.2万元，私人随意占用的资金达20万元。
    1988年7月，三和公司董事长全寿延突然打电话给湖南省商贸公司经理杨建成，让杨建成帮忙推销5000吨铝锭。铝锭是当今国内市场上的紧俏货，杨建成当然乐意效劳。他当即将这一信息通知给急于搞到铝锭的湖南电气设备工业公司的有关人员。然而，对方担心三和公司有诈，不愿意直接同三和公司做铝锭生意，杨建成便决定充当“中间人”。
    7月25日，省商贸公司与三和公司签订了5000吨铝锭的联营协议。协议书规定：三和公司组织货源，省商贸公司负责销售。
    其实，根本没有货源。
    骗者下饵　愿者上钩
    7月26日，省商贸公司同省电气设备工业公司签订了一份合同，将5000吨铝锭出售给电气公司，每吨售价1.1万元。
    7月28日，省电气设备工业公司转手将其中的3000吨铝锭卖给湖南省冶金工业总公司经营开发部。每吨售价1.18万元，双方签订了合同。接着，省冶金工业总公司经营开发部将合同内的1000吨铝锭卖给中国五矿总公司湖南分公司联合贸易公司。双方也签订了合同。
    7月底，省冶金工业总公司经营开发部和另一家单位汇给省电气设备工业公司货款440万元。
    几天之后，省商贸公司收到了这笔巨款。按照协议的规定，他们截留了其中的53万元留作自用，而将其余的387万元转给了三和公司。三和公司接到这笔款子后，一部分被他们留用，一部分用于归还货款，支付赔偿费，一部分用来做生意。
    440万元巨款汇到了三和公司和湖南省商贸公司的名下后，5000吨铝锭却迟迟不见踪影。于是，省冶金工业总公司经营开发部向省电气设备工业公司催要铝锭，省电气设备工业公司又向省商贸公司催要货物，省商贸公司再向三和公司催货。催来催去，大多数人才发觉上了三和公司的当。接着，催货又变成了追款。但是，三和公司已经将这笔巨款花得差不多了。
    赚钱心切　失去警觉
    受骗的几家公司原先都打着如意算盘：这笔毫不费劲的铝锭买卖做成了，省商贸公司转转手，从中就可获利50万元，省电气设备工业公司从中可获利200多万元，省冶金总公司经营开发部也可分肥20万元。因此，这几家定货单位竟不审查货源，就盲目地签订了合同，支付了巨额货款。为什么三和公司一个电话，竟使几家单位上当受骗呢？当记者提出这一问题时，回答竟是如此的一致：“对方是省级公司，有大公司的招牌，我们信服。”有些人还说：“合同书上已经将有关条款写得明明白白，我们也就放心了”省电气设备工业公司的经办人曾两次向公司领导人写了如果铝锭合同发生问题，他愿承担一切责任的担保书。现在，他应承担什么责任呢？
    赚钱的欲望使一些人眼花缭乱，即便这个铝锭合同出现了破绽，骗钱者露出了尾巴，也没有能引起有关经办人员的注意。例如，省商贸公司与三和公司签定协议后，有两位同志曾劝阻杨建成不要做这笔生意。他们认为：这批铝锭的价格远远低于当时市场上的价格，这很值得怀疑；三和公司董事长全寿延说供货方在深圳，而深圳不少单位急需铝锭，为什么深圳的货主要向湖南推销铝锭呢？对此，杨建成不但不做冷静的思考，反而要将这两位同志开除出公司。
    三和公司将387万元骗到手后，1988年8月，省电气设备工业公司梁百泉等人与三和公司董事长全寿延约好，到黑龙江齐齐哈尔市看货。梁百泉等人在那里等了20多天，没有发现全寿延的影子，更不要说看货了。此时，稍有警惕性的人都能从中看出问题。令人不解的是，梁百泉等人仍一味地要铝锭，因为那时的铝锭价格又上涨了。人们应该从这起巨款被骗案中，吸取哪些教训呢？
    目前，长沙市人民检察院正在侦查这起巨款骗案。
