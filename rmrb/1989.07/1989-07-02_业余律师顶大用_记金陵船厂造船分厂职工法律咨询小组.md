When it comes to addressing the concerns of workers, people naturally think of housing, children, and the basket of goods. However, at the Jinling Shipyard Shipbuilding Sub-factory in Nanjing, there is an additional item: legal cases. The factory has organized a group of workers who have passed the legal self-study examination or graduated from the legal major of the radio and television university to form a workers' legal consultation group. They use their spare time to provide legal consultation services for all the workers in the factory. Over the past two years, they have handled more than 70 legal consultations, covering criminal litigation, property disputes, marriage, and inheritance issues. Workers say, “Part-time lawyers are very useful!”

A worker bought a Hitachi refrigerator, but due to poor quality, it broke down after just over a month. The worker went to the store, but the store sent him to the supplier. Over several months, he made multiple trips, and finally, the store reluctantly agreed to repair it once, stating that any future issues would not be their responsibility. Helpless, the worker sought help from the consultation group. The group members accompanied him to the municipal consumer association and copied relevant documents from the national departments regarding the “three guarantees” for domestic appliances. The worker then went back to the store and argued based on the regulations. The store had no choice but to agree to repair the refrigerator according to the regulations. The worker sighed, “If I had come to the legal consultation group earlier, I wouldn’t have had to run around so much and suffer so much humiliation!”

The consultation group provides legal consultations for workers, adhering to the law without favoritism. A worker’s wife filed for divorce in court, and the worker secretly transferred part of the family’s property. After the court made the divorce ruling, he still refused to hand over the part of the property awarded to his wife. The members of the consultation group promptly explained to him: the court’s ruling represents the state, and once it takes legal effect, the relevant parties must execute it; otherwise, the people’s court has the right to enforce it. Those who refuse to execute it may face criminal charges. This explanation changed the worker’s attitude, and he voluntarily handed over the part of the property awarded to his wife.

The consultation group not only warmly receives workers who come to ask questions but sometimes also proactively provides door-to-door services. A young worker in the factory had a dispute with a neighbor, who threatened him with a knife. After being stopped by onlookers, the neighbor hit the worker on the head with a brick, requiring three stitches. The doctor diagnosed it as a moderate concussion. The young man couldn’t swallow his anger and was prepared to retaliate. The consultation group heard about the incident, went to the scene to understand the situation, and believed that the neighbor had committed the crime of intentional injury and could be sued in court to pursue criminal responsibility. They also helped the worker write a lawsuit and provided legal assistance in court twice. In the end, the court sentenced the defendant to one month of detention and compensated the victim for economic losses, thus avoiding a potential serious violent incident.

Actions speak louder than words. Two years ago, when the workers' legal consultation group was just established, there were still some rumors. But now, the workers have a new respect for them. Not only do they come for their own matters, but they also come for their children’s and fellow villagers’ issues. Even workers from other units come to seek help. One day, a worker from the Nanjing Knitwear Factory came to the consultation group, complaining that a construction team working next to his house had caused severe damage to his residence, with doors and windows deformed and unable to open, and multiple cracks on the walls. The Municipal Engineering Society confirmed that the damage was indeed caused by the construction. For more than a year, he had been running around for repairs and compensation, from the construction unit to the relevant authorities, and had spent a lot of effort. The news media had also advocated for him, but the problem remained unsolved. The members of the consultation group provided him with relevant legal basis from the “General Principles of Civil Law.” They suggested that he sue in court, and the worker went to court and finally won the case, obtaining more than 5,000 yuan in compensation. He was very grateful and insisted on giving 100 yuan as a reward, which was naturally declined by the members of the consultation group.

    “业余律师顶大用”
    ——记金陵船厂造船分厂职工法律咨询小组
    本报记者　龚永泉
    说到解决职工的后顾之忧，人们自然联想起房子、孩子、篮子的事，不过，在南京金陵船厂造船分厂还多一项，就是案子。这个厂把几位通过法律自学考试或电大法律专业毕业的职工组织起来，成立了职工法律咨询小组，利用业余时间为全厂职工提供法律咨询服务。两年来共接受法律咨询70多次，涉及刑事诉讼、房产纠纷、婚姻、财产继承等方面。职工们说：“业余律师顶大用！”
    一位职工购回一台日芝牌电冰箱，由于质量低劣，仅用一个多月就坏了。这位职工找到商场，商场又打发他到供货单位。几个月中，他往返跑了多次，最后商场只勉强答应给予一次性维修，以后再出故障概不负责。无奈，这位职工求援于咨询小组。小组的同志陪他找到市消费者协会，复印了国家有关部门关于国产家电“三包”规定的文件。这位职工再次来到商场，据理力争，商场不得不同意按规定给予保修。这位职工深有感触地说：“要是早一点找法律咨询小组，也用不着跑这么多冤枉路，受这么多窝囊气了！”
    咨询小组为职工提供法律咨询，不搞胳膊肘朝里弯，而是依法办事。厂里有位职工的妻子向法院提出离婚，这位职工擅自将部分家庭财产转移。法院作出离婚判决以后，他仍不肯交出判给对方的那部分财产。咨询小组的成员及时向他说明：法院判决是代表国家作出的，一旦发生法律效力，有关当事人必须执行，否则，人民法院有权强制执行。拒不执行情节严重者，还将构成刑事犯罪。一番剖析使这位职工转变了态度，主动将对方的部分财产如数交出。
    咨询小组不仅热心接待职工登门询问，有时还主动上门服务。厂里一年轻职工同邻居发生纠纷，对方竟持刀进行威胁，被围观的群众劝阻后，又用砖块击中这位职工头部，缝了三针，医生诊断为中型脑震荡。小伙子咽不下这口气，准备以牙还牙，拚它一场。咨询小组闻讯后，赶到现场了解经过，认为对方已构成故意伤害罪，可以向法院起诉，追究其刑事责任。并帮助这位职工写了起诉状，又两次到庭提供法律帮助。最后，法院依法判处被告人一个月拘役，并赔偿被害人的经济损失，避免了一场可能发生的恶性流血事件。
    桃李不言，下自成蹊。两年前，当职工法律咨询小组刚成立时，还有人风言风语，但如今职工们已经刮目相看，不仅关于自己的事，连子女、老乡的事也来咨询，甚至外单位也有职工慕名前来。一天，南京针织内衣厂一职工找到咨询小组，诉说一工程队紧靠他家施工，致使住房严重损坏，门窗变形，开启受阻，墙壁上出现多道裂纹。经市土木工程学会鉴定，确系建筑施工所致。一年多来，他为维修和索赔，从施工单位找到有关主管部门，不知跑了多少路，耗费了多少精力，新闻单位也曾为其呼吁，但问题始终没有得到解决。咨询小组的同志向他提供了《民法通则》中的有关法律依据。建议他向法院起诉，这位职工走上法庭，终于打赢了这场官司，得到了5000多元赔偿费。他非常感激，一定要拿出100元钱作为酬谢，自然是被咨询小组的同志谢绝了。
