On June 9, reporters went to Changying Town in Taikang County, Henan Province, for an interview. They happened to meet County Party Secretary Wang Qingfeng there inspecting work. It was time for dinner, and Secretary Wang and the township officials took their bowls, chopsticks, and meal tickets to the cafeteria to line up for food. The cook served him a bowl of braised tofu, along with two steamed buns and a bowl of congee.

In early June 1987, the town party committee made a decision to "not treat superiors to meals, not accept invitations from subordinates, and use big bowl meals to entertain guests." Since then, they have resolutely stopped hosting banquets. "They were determined to create a small atmosphere of clean governance." Coincidentally, just after the town party committee made this decision, on July 1, the municipal party committee secretary, Zhu Deqin, came to Changying Town to inspect work. A county leader specially reminded them: "You should treat him to a six-dish-one-soup meal with canned beer." However, Party Secretary Lao Zhu and Town Mayor Wan Jinceng firmly decided: "We will still treat Secretary Zhu to a big bowl meal." Unexpectedly, after the meal, they received high praise from Secretary Zhu. Later, when the director of the provincial agricultural commission, the deputy secretary of the provincial discipline inspection commission, and the vice governor came, they also ate big bowl meals. Various administrative villages and township-level agencies followed suit. The town saved more than 100,000 yuan per month just on entertainment expenses.

Using "big bowl meals" to entertain guests also stirred up some trouble. In December 1987, the entire county organized a unified water conservancy project, and Changying Town completed the task early and with good quality. However, because the inspection team still ate "big bowl meals" when they came to Changying Town, the town was ranked lower and did not receive the bonus. In 1988, under the target responsibility system, Changying Town completed the task at the forefront. However, the cadre reward promotion indicators were not given to Changying Town. Towns that completed the task poorly still received promotions. However, the town party committee remained steadfast in using big bowl meals to entertain guests. Over the past two years, they have not hosted a single banquet and have not used public funds to entertain guests even once.

    太康“大碗菜”
    郭伟亭　王友恭
    6月9日，记者到河南省太康县常营镇采访，正遇上县委书记王庆丰到这里检查工作。该吃晚饭了，王书记和乡干部一起拿了碗、筷和餐票到食堂里排队就餐。炊事员给他盛了一碗烧豆腐，又递给他两个馒头一碗粥。
    1987年6月初，镇党委做出了“对上不请吃，对下不吃请，用大碗菜招待客人的决定”。从那以后，他们硬着头皮不再摆宴席。“决心创造一个为政清廉的小气候”。事也凑巧，就在镇党委做出决定不久的7月1日，地委书记朱德勤到常营镇检查工作。县委的一位领导特意叮嘱他们：“要用六菜一汤，铁盒啤酒招待”。可是，党委书记老朱和镇长万进城毅然商定：“仍然用大碗菜招待朱书记”。没想到，饭后受到朱书记的高度赞扬。后来，省农委主任、省纪检会副书记、副省长来时也是吃的大碗菜。各行政村和镇直机关纷纷效法，仅招待费一项，全镇每月节约万元以上。
    用“大碗菜”招待客人，也招惹了一些风波。1987年12月全县统一组织水利工程，常营镇任务完成早，质量好。然而由于检查到常营镇时，仍然吃的“大碗菜”。名次排列靠后站，应得奖金未拿到手。1988年实行目标管理责任制，常营镇任务完成名列前茅。可是干部的奖励升级指标未给常营镇一个。任务完成不好的乡照常升级。可镇党委一班人，用大碗菜招待客人坚定不移。两年来，没有摆过一次宴席，没有用公款招待一次酒。
