Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 19th.

The first "Zhong Jiaqing Mathematics Award," established to honor outstanding young mathematicians, was recently announced in Beijing. Liu Kefeng, Xia Qi, Wong Lim, and Song Binheng were the four recipients of this year's award.

Zhong Jiaqing made significant contributions to the development of modern mathematics in China, particularly in the fields of several complex variables and differential geometry. He passed away on April 12, 1987, due to overwork while working at Columbia University in the United States. To commemorate this young scientist, renowned mathematicians and scholars from both home and abroad spontaneously raised funds to establish the "Zhong Jiaqing Mathematics Award." The award is given annually based on outstanding mathematical papers, recognizing master's and doctoral students who have made creative contributions in pure and applied mathematics.

This year's selection process was overseen by the "Zhong Jiaqing Fund Executive Committee," composed of distinguished mathematicians Yang Le, Gong Sheng, Xiao Shutie, and Zhang Gongqing.

    首届钟家庆数学奖揭晓
    四位青年获殊荣
    新华社北京7月19日电  （通讯员范建）为奖励优秀青年数学家而设立的“钟家庆数学奖”首届评奖活动最近在北京揭晓：刘克峰、夏琪、翁林、宋斌恒等4人获奖。
    钟家庆是对我国现代数学发展有重大贡献的数学家，在多复变函数与微分几何方面成就卓著。他于1987年4月12日在美国哥伦比亚大学工作期间因劳累过度病逝。为纪念这位中年科学家，海内外著名数学家和有识之士自发募集、设立了“钟家庆数学奖”。每年以优秀数学论文为依据评奖一次，奖励我国在纯数学和应用数学方面具有创造性研究的硕士和博士研究生。
    这次评选活动是由著名数学家杨乐、龚升、萧树铁、张恭庆组成的“钟家庆基金执行委员会”主持进行的。
