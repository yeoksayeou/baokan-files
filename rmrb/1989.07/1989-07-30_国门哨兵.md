Zhāngmù Port is the gateway to Tibet. The second platoon of a certain unit under the Dayêzê Military Sub-district, which has been stationed there year-round, has repeatedly distinguished itself in the struggle against infiltration, preventing escapes, and cracking down on smuggling. They are renowned as reliable "guardians of the border."

	High Alert to Capture "Wolves"

On October 26th of last year, in the afternoon, soldier Yang Wenquan of the second platoon was on duty when he noticed someone approaching from the border. The person stopped at the bridgehead and did not proceed to the checkpoint for inspection. Instead, they paced back and forth, looking around. Yang Wenquan immediately became alert and reported the situation to Platoon Leader Pan Zhencheng. Based on his experience, Pan judged, "There's a fox trail ahead. There must be wolves following behind," and he meticulously planned an ambush for that night.

In late October on the Tibetan Plateau, the snow season had already begun. Soldiers Yang Wenquan and Li Zaifeng of the second platoon, who were executing the ambush mission, did not wear padded clothes to ensure quick and convenient movement. They shivered from the cold, but they still focused all their attention on the road ahead. At 1:30 AM, through the darkness, they saw four figures emerge from the roadside bushes and leap to either side of the road, crouching as they stealthily approached the bridgehead. Just as they were about to cross the bridgehead, two sudden shouts rang out: "Don't move!" "Stand still for inspection!" This unexpected command made the four illegal border-crossers stand still without daring to move. When the illegal border-crossers realized that there were only two soldiers in front of them, they attempted to force their way through the checkpoint. However, upon receiving Li Zaifeng's signal, Platoon Leader Pan and Platoon Leader Li Zhifeng promptly arrived at the bridgehead and successfully apprehended the four illegal "uninvited guests."

Upon interrogation by relevant authorities, it was revealed that these four illegal border-crossers had been sent in to attempt to split the motherland, engage in subversive activities, and cause destruction.

	Diligent Efforts to Intercept Smuggling

The second platoon's base is just a bridge away from the Zāngmù Customs. All the soldiers in the platoon regard assisting the customs in cracking down on smuggling and private trading as their duty.

On the morning of Chinese New Year's Eve, Tibetan soldier Bianba was on duty. Suddenly, he spotted two people climbing up the mountain opposite. Due to the steep slope and dense forest, the figures appeared and disappeared. He judged that these two individuals, who chose the dangerous path instead of the safe one, were definitely up to no good! After reporting to the platoon leader, he immediately set out with another Tibetan soldier named Laba, carrying submachine guns, to head towards the opposite mountain. The two men, seeing someone chasing them from below, fled in panic, running faster and faster. Driven by a strong sense of responsibility, Bianba and Laba, despite the steep mountain, dense thorns, and the risk of falling, climbed relentlessly. They ignored the cuts on their hands, the torn clothes, and the slips. After a tense struggle of strength and willpower, the two men finally gave up, hurriedly hiding their items, and then pretending to be woodcutters, refusing to confess. Bianba and Laba carefully searched and found two cloth bags hidden among the rocks, containing 778 silver dollars. Faced with the ironclad evidence, the two smugglers had no choice but to lower their heads. They then followed Bianba and Laba to the customs for processing. Later, their superiors awarded Bianba and Laba each a third-class merit citation.

	Dedicated to Duty in Preventing Escapes

Some people, after committing crimes and attempting to evade legal punishment, or due to engaging in activities to split the motherland, place their hopes of fleeing the country on the bridge guarded by the second platoon. Since the unrest in Lhasa last year, such incidents have occurred frequently here, but none of the adventurers' plots have succeeded.

One night, half past midnight, sentry Wu Ping, with his keen hearing, faintly heard some noise in the night wind and followed the sound to investigate. He shone his flashlight towards the source of the noise and saw four people attempting to cross the mountain to escape abroad. Wu Ping shouted, "Who's there?" and simultaneously pulled the bolt of his gun with a clatter. The four people tumbled and crawled back into the deep ravine in fear. Although he did not catch the would-be escapees due to the darkness, he effectively prevented an escape incident from occurring.

Another time, Deputy Platoon Leader Xiong Wenjun was on duty when he spotted someone on the opposite hillside, using the morning mist and tree cover to crouch and stand, walk and stop, attempting to cross the mountain to escape. Xiong Wenjun ordered him to come down immediately for inspection, or else he would shoot. Seeing that he could not escape, the man came to Deputy Platoon Leader Xiong. With a smirk, he took out 50 yuan from his waist and, using a mix of Tibetan and Mandarin, said, "Comrade, you are all bodhisattvas. Please do me a favor and let me pass. Helping others is helping yourself, right!" Xiong Wenjun sternly refused and immediately escorted the man to the Zāngmù Border Inspection Station. Upon questioning, it was discovered that this person was a fugitive wanted by the public security authorities.

    国门哨兵
    刘晓军
    樟木口岸是西藏的门户。常年驻守在这里的日喀则军分区某部二班，在反派遣、防外逃和抓走私等斗争中屡建功勋，被誉为信得过的“国门哨兵”。
          高度警惕逮“野狼”
    去年10月26日下午二班战士杨文权站哨时，见从境外方向走来一人，快到桥头时停住了脚步。既不过关接受检查，又不马上返回，只是一边来回走动，一边四下观望。杨文权立即警觉起来，将情况向排长攀振成作了报告。攀排长根据经验判断：“前面有狐狸踏道。后边肯定有野狼跟随”，便周密安排了一个深夜设伏的计划。
    西藏高原10月底，早已进入雪季。执行设伏任务的二班战士杨文权和李再文为了动作方便迅速，都没有穿棉衣，两人冻得浑身发抖，但他们依然把全部注意力集中在前方公路上。凌晨1时30分，透过夜暗，他们看到4个黑影从路边树丛中窜出，跃到公路两侧，猫着腰悄悄向桥头摸来。正当他们准备爬过桥头的时候，突然两声怒吼：“不许动！”“老实接受检查！”这突如其来的喝令，使4个非法越境者乖乖地站在原地不敢动。当非法越境者发现眼前只有两个解放军时，企图强行闯关入境，得到李再文暗号报告的攀排长和二班长李治奉及时赶到桥头，一举将4个非法“不速之客”逮获。
    经有关部门审讯，这4个非法入境者都是被派进来企图进行分裂祖国、搞颠覆和破坏活动的。
            一丝不苟截走私
    二班驻地与樟木海关只一桥之隔。全班战士都把配合海关打击走私、贩私活动，做为义不容辞的责任。
    大年三十早上，藏族战士边巴站哨。突然，他发现对面的大山上爬过来两个人。由于坡陡林密，人影时隐时现。他判断，这两个家伙好路不走走险路，一定不是好人！他向班长请示后，立即和另一名叫拉巴的藏族战士带着冲锋枪迎头向对面山上爬去。那两人见山下有人追来，慌忙逃窜，越跑越快。高度的责任心驱使着边巴和拉巴不顾山高坡陡，荆棘丛生，顽强地向上攀登。手划破了不管，衣挂坏了不理，滑下来再爬。经过一番体力和毅力的紧张较量，那两个家伙终于败下阵来，匆忙把东西藏好，然后装做砍柴人，死不交代。边巴和拉巴仔细搜索，从石头缝里找出两个布口袋，里面装有778块银元。在铁的事实面前，那两个走私者只好低下头。跟着边巴和拉巴来到海关接受处理。事后，上级给边巴和拉巴各记三等功一次。
            忠于职守挡外逃
    有的人因犯罪后企图逃避法律制裁，亦或出于从事分裂祖国活动的需要，把叛国出逃的希望，盯在二班守卫的桥上。自去年拉萨发生骚乱事件以来，这里不断出现此类事件，但是没有一个冒险者的阴谋得逞。
    一天后半夜，哨兵伍平凭着敏锐的听力，从夜风中隐约听见有响动，便循声过去察看。他用手电筒向有动静的地方一照。见有4人正想翻山越境外逃。伍平大喊一声“什么人”，同时哗啦一声拉响枪机。吓得那4个人连滚带爬滑回深沟。虽然因夜暗没抓住几个企图出逃者，却有效地挡住了一起外逃事件的发生。
    还有一次，副班长熊文俊站岗的时候，发现对面山坡上有个人，借着晨雾和树林的掩护，时蹲时站，时走时停，企图翻山越境。熊文俊严令他立即下来接受检查，否则就开枪。那个家伙见已无法逃脱，便来到熊副班长面前。嘻皮笑脸地从腰里掏出50元钱，用半藏半汉的话说：“金珠玛米个个都是菩萨心肠，你就行行好，放我过去吧。与人方便与己也方便嘛！”熊文俊严词拒绝，当即将这个人押送到樟木边防检查站。经查问得知，此人正是公安机关正在通缉的一名逃犯。
