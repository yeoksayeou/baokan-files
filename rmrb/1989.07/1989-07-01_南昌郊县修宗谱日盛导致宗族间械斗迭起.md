The practice of compiling genealogies in some townships and villages in the suburbs of Nanchang is becoming increasingly serious, leading to frequent clan fights.

According to statistics from relevant departments, tens of thousands of farmers in the suburbs of Nanchang are involved in the practice of compiling genealogies. In some places, the influence of village heads is overshadowed by that of "clan leaders," and the authority of courts is undermined by "clan tribunals." Due to the incitement of clan forces, in some villages of Jinxian County, minor disputes over house foundations and water usage often escalate into clan conflicts between different surnames and lineages. Some of these conflicts even develop into armed clashes. After compiling genealogies, many villages openly obstruct and sabotage the implementation of family planning policies. Officials in various suburban counties of Nanchang strongly demand that this trend be curbed.

    南昌郊县修宗谱日盛导致宗族间械斗迭起
    本报南昌7月1日电  南昌市郊县一些乡、村修宗谱活动日益严重，导致宗族之间械斗迭起。
    据有关部门统计，南昌郊县涉及修宗谱的农民达数十万人，一些地方出现了村长不如“族长”、法庭不如“公堂”的现象。由于宗族势力的煽动，进贤县一些村落为盖房地基、用水等小事，常常酿成为姓氏、房股之间的宗族纠纷，有的甚至发展到械斗。不少乡村修了宗谱后公然阻碍和破坏计划生育的推行。南昌各郊县干部强烈要求遏制这股歪风。
