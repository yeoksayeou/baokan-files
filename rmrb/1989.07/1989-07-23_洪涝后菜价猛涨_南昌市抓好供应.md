Nanchang City is taking active measures to restore vegetable production and ensure market supply.

Since late June, more than 30,000 mu of vegetable fields in Nanchang City have been affected by floods, with some experiencing wilting and rotting, and others suffering from root decay and dead vines. Among these, 9,000 mu of vegetables have been completely destroyed, leading to a significant reduction in vegetable supply and a sharp increase in prices.

To alleviate the tension in the vegetable market, the Nanchang City government has taken the following effective measures:

First, it organized the replanting of 5,139 mu of quick-growing, fast-maturing vegetables. Second, the vegetable company dispatched personnel to purchase vegetables from outside, bringing in a total of 197,000 jin of vegetables to ensure that the vegetable company supplies at least 150,000 jin of vegetables daily. Third, it implemented preferential policies to encourage out-of-town merchants to sell vegetables in Nanchang, ensuring smooth entry for vegetable trucks without any fees, and providing a minimum protection price for the sale of certain varieties such as chili peppers. Fourth, it held a large-scale vegetable bidding and procurement meeting, with a total of 2,049,000 jin of vegetables contracted, covering 26 varieties.

Currently, the prices of some vegetables with higher price increases in Nanchang City have started to decline.

    洪涝后菜价猛涨  南昌市抓好供应
    新华社南昌7月23日电  （记者杨健）南昌市积极采取措施，恢复蔬菜生产，搞好市场供应。
    6月下旬以来，南昌市有3万多亩菜地遭受洪涝灾害，有的落花烂果，有的糜根死藤，其中有9000亩蔬菜全部被毁，蔬菜上市量大减，菜价猛涨。
    为了缓和蔬菜市场的紧张局面，南昌市政府采取了有力措施：
    一是组织抢种、补种生产周期短、上市快的蔬菜5139亩。二是蔬菜公司及时派人外出采购蔬菜，先后调进蔬菜197万公斤，保证蔬菜公司每天蔬菜供应量不少于15万公斤。三是采取优惠政策，鼓励外地客商来南昌卖菜，菜车进城畅通无阻，免收费用，并对辣椒等品种的销售实行最低保护价。四是举办大型蔬菜招标订货会，成交2049万公斤，品种达26个。
    目前，南昌市涨幅较高的部分藤果菜的价格开始回落。
