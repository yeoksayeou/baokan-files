    Ma'anshan Resolutely Punishes Corruption
    Mayor Welcomes "Citizens Suing Officials"

    People's Daily, Ma'anshan — Reporter Zhang Zhen Guo reports: Recently, at a meeting of county-level and above cadres in Ma'anshan, Anhui, Mayor Zhou Yude listed six types of corrupt behaviors that the people detest and abhor, and clearly stated his welcome of "citizens suing officials."

    He pointed out six types of corrupt behaviors: using power for personal gain, embezzlement and bribery, official profiteering, bureaucratism, extravagance and waste, and indulging children and relatives. He angrily said, some people who manage money, materials, and personnel, take the opportunity to extort and blackmail; a steel or fertilizer allocation note, after being passed around in a hotel, its price "snowballs"; some officials, once in power, become arrogant towards the people; some cadres not only live in oversized houses themselves, but also fight for and occupy houses for their children; the trend of extravagant banquets is spreading like a plague.

    Regarding these behaviors, he announced the measures of the Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government to punish them, and mobilized the masses to report and expose them. For those found to be true, they will be exposed in newspapers, on the radio, and on television, making them publicly accountable. Those who voluntarily confess and admit their wrongdoings by the end of August will be treated leniently, otherwise, they will be severely punished. The extravagant banquet trend will be severely curbed, extending from municipal-level agencies to enterprises, leaving no "special zones." Members of the Municipal Party Committee will be responsible for investigating and handling a number of major cases, and making them public.

    马鞍山坚决惩治腐败
    市长欢迎“民告官”
    本报马鞍山电　记者张振国报道：安徽马鞍山市市长周玉德日前在全市县以上干部会上，历数群众深恶痛绝的6种腐败行为后，明确表示欢迎“民告官”。
    他指出6种腐败行为是：以权谋私、贪污受贿、官倒私倒、官僚主义、挥霍浪费、放纵子女和亲属。他气愤地说，一些管钱、管物、管人的人，借机敲诈勒索；一张钢材、化肥批条，在旅馆里转了一圈，价格“滚雪球”，一些人当了官，就对人民群众横眉竖眼；一些干部不仅自己超标准住房，还为子女争房、占房；吃喝风蔓延成灾。
    对这些行为，他宣布了市委、市府的惩治措施，发动群众检举揭发。凡是查实的，要登报、广播、上电视，让其亮相。8月底以前主动坦白交待的，从宽处理，否则从严惩处。狠刹吃喝风，从市级机关延伸到企业，不留“特区”。市委常委分工负责，抓紧查处一批大案要案，公布于众。
