    Reflections on the Land  	[An Idea That Needs Analysis] 	“Protecting Young Students.”

    Indeed, young students need protection. However, how should we protect them? Just as we protect our own children, when they make mistakes, true protection should be to criticize and educate them sternly. To indulge in mistakes, or to see young students heading towards a precipice and not make any criticism, not even a warning, is that still protection?

    Young students (and others as well) often have a fixed mindset: those who agree with their thoughts and support their actions are considered protective and are readily accepted; otherwise, they resist and do not accept. The danger lies here: those with ulterior motives will very much agree with you and very much support you, aiming to use your momentary passion and inevitable impulsiveness to incite you to rush forward, using you as a pawn to take chestnuts out of the fire. Where is the “protection” here? It is only harm!

    The phrase “protecting young students” is incorrect because young students are diverse. A general statement of “protection” actually harms the majority of students. I remember Mr. Lu Xun saying that he had always believed in the theory of evolution, thinking that young people would definitely surpass the old, “but later I realized that I was wrong,” “In Guangdong, I witnessed young people divided into two major camps, some writing letters to inform on others, some helping the officials to arrest people!” My thinking was thus shattered, and later I often looked at young people with a skeptical eye, no longer unconditionally respecting them.

    How can one unconditionally “protect” “young students”?

    [A Serious Truth] 	Truth can turn into error with just one step; quantitative change leads to qualitative change.

    Life tells us: there is no great wall between non-crime and crime. For example: holding a knife and threatening someone with a knife are different, and stabbing someone with a knife or killing someone with a knife are even more different. The nature and handling of these actions are different. There is no room for hesitation here.

    Patriotism, of course, is good; to rationally promote the resolution of problems through democratic and legal channels for the sake of patriotism is not only not a crime but should be encouraged; but if one creates endless trouble, obstructs traffic, and disrupts the normal order of social life, even if the slogan is still “patriotism,” it has already become illegal; if one causes chaos, seeking to overthrow the people's government and its leaders, even colluding with hostile forces at home and abroad, engaging in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing, then it has nothing to do with “patriotism” at all, and it is completely unrelated. That is a serious crime.

    Determining guilt and non-guilt is based on facts and the standard is the law. The sword of the law is merciless, and in its presence, all are equal.

    大地漫笔 　 〔一个需要分析的提法〕　“爱护青年学生”。
    不错，青年学生是要爱护的。然而，怎么个爱护法呢？如同爱护自己的子女，当他们做了错事，真正的爱护应当是严厉地进行批评教育一样，姑息错误，甚至明明看到青年学生走向悬崖峭壁，一点批评不做，连提醒一下也没进行，难道还是爱护吗？
    青年学生（其他的人们也不免）常常有一种思维定式：顺着自己想法的，支持自己行动的，就认为是爱护，非常好接受；反之就抵触，就不接受。危险恰恰在这里：别有用心的人，非常地顺着你、非常地支持你，目的在于利用你一时的激情、难免的冲动，煽动你往前冲，把你当成手为他们火中取栗。此处哪有什么“爱护”，唯坑害耳！
    “爱护青年学生”这个提法之所以不确，还因为青年学生是可分的，笼统地提“爱护”反倒害了学生中的大多数。记得鲁迅先生说过，他一向相信进化论，认为青年必胜于老年人，“后来我明白我倒是错了”，“我在广东，就目睹了同是青年，而分成两大阵营，或则投书告密，或则助官捕人的事实！我的思路因此轰毁，后来便时常用了怀疑的眼光去看青年，不再无条件的敬畏了”。
    无条件地“爱护”“青年学生”，怎么可以？
    〔一条严肃的真理〕　真理走过了一步就可能变成谬误，量变到质变。
    生活告诉人们：非罪与罪没有隔着万里长城。比方：手里拿着刀和用刀威胁他人不同，和用刀刺伤他人、用刀杀死他人更不同，性质不同处理也不同。这里没有游移的余地。
    爱国，当然是好的；为爱国而理智地通过民主与法制的轨道促使问题的解决，不仅无罪，还应当提倡；可闹个没完没了，阻碍交通，影响社会生活的正常秩序，尽管口号仍是“爱国”，也已属非法；闹到天翻地覆，必欲置人民政权和政府领导人于死地，以至同社会上和国外的敌对势力相呼应勾结，打、砸、抢、烧、杀，那就同“爱国”风马牛不相及，完全扯不上了，那就犯了重罪。
    判定罪与非罪，依据是事实，准绳是法律。法律之剑无情，在它面前，人人平等。
