The newly appointed Argentine Minister of Economy, Miguel Roig, announced the long-awaited economic stabilization plan to the nation this evening via television and radio.

One of the key components of the plan is to control the rampant price increases to reduce the inflation rate. It stipulates that the recent price hikes of essential goods must be corrected, and the government will set the maximum selling prices for these items. Excessive prices must be lowered. For example, the price of bread must be reduced by half from the current level, and the prices of non-essential goods will be rolled back to the levels of July 3rd.

Inflation is currently the most pressing issue in Argentina, with the inflation rate reaching 114.5% in June.

To increase government revenue, the fees for public services operated by the state will be significantly raised. However, preferential treatment will be given to low-income, low-consumption groups.

Regarding wages, negotiations to adjust wages will be conducted on the principle that increased income will not be passed on to prices. Additionally, a one-time emergency subsidy of 8000 Australes (approximately $12) will be issued to all salaried workers next week.

Another crucial part of the plan is to significantly reduce public expenditures to decrease the fiscal deficit. At the same time, public utilities currently operated by the state (excluding those related to national security) will be transferred to private management. Furthermore, the tax system will be reformed, tax evasion will be severely punished, and preferential treatments and subsidies provided by the state to private enterprises will be canceled or temporarily suspended.

To encourage and attract foreign capital, the existing foreign investment law will be amended to ensure that foreign capital enjoys the same treatment as domestic capital.

    阿根廷新政府宣布稳定经济计划
    降低通货膨胀  压缩公共开支
    据新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯7月9日电  （记者可大安）新上任的阿根廷经济部长米格尔·罗伊格今晚通过电视广播讲话向全国宣布了人们期望已久的稳定经济计划。
    计划的重要内容之一是控制物价的疯狂上涨，以降低通货膨胀率。它规定，最近几天主要生活必需品乱涨价的情况必须纠正，对这些商品将由政府规定最高售价，超过者必须降价。例如，面包要比目前的价格降低一半，其他非必需品的价格也要降到7月3日的水平。
    通货膨胀是阿根廷目前最令人忧虑的问题，6月份通货膨胀率达到114.5％。
    为了增加国库收入，由国家经营的公共服务事业收费标准要大幅度提高，但是对于低收入、低消费阶层将给予优惠待遇。
    关于工资，将在增加的收入不转嫁到价格上的原则下，进行调整工资的谈判。此外，下星期将向所有工薪阶层发放一次性紧急补助，数目是8000奥斯特拉尔（约合12美元）。
    计划的另一重要部分是大力压缩公共开支，以减少财政赤字，同时要把目前由国家经营的公用事业（涉及国家安全的除外）转交私人经营。另外还要改革税收制度，严惩逃税现象，取消或暂时停止国家向私人企业提供的优惠待遇和补贴。
    为了鼓励和吸引外国资本，将修改现行的外国投资法，力求使外资享受同本国资本相同的待遇。
