Today's cross-country race focused on the top three individual positions. The military pentathlon cross-country race is 8 kilometers long, with a base score of 1000 points for a time of 28 minutes. Each second ahead or behind this time adds or subtracts one point, respectively. Athletes start individually at one-minute intervals, with the highest scorers starting last. Thus, the last three starters were Yang Chunyi, Bandela, and Liang Xifen. Among them, Yang Chunyi had the best cross-country performance, while Bandela and Liang Xifen were neck and neck. However, Yang Chunyi's score was 44.1 points behind Bandela, and Liang Xifen was only 2.8 points ahead of Bandela, making the outcome uncertain.

During the race, Yang Chunyi fought fiercely to widen the gap with Bandela, finishing in 26 minutes and 51 seconds, significantly faster than Bandela's 27 minutes and 27 seconds. However, his total score was still 6.7 points behind, placing him third. Liang Xifen, on the other hand, gritted her teeth and closely followed Bandela, ultimately finishing with a time of 27 minutes and 25 seconds, 4 seconds faster than Bandela. She won with a total score difference of 6.8 points. As Liang Xifen crossed the finish line last, the crowd erupted in cheers. "China has won!" Friendly military athletes pulled Liang Xifen and other Chinese team members for group photos. The Venezuelan girl, Rivelo, who led the Chinese team in the opening ceremony, enthusiastically told the reporter, "These days, everyone has been talking about the Chinese team. Their performance is excellent. They not only have good results but also good conduct, strict discipline, and I am proud of them." After the competition, Rivelo specially visited the Chinese team's camp, giving each team member a small souvenir.

After the race, Major General Wang Zhitong, the head of the Chinese delegation, said, "Our team, after a long journey to a foreign land, has achieved such results, proving that the athletes have passed the test. This is inseparable from the military pentathlon team's usual emphasis on ideological and political work, strict management, scientific training, and internal unity."

    一鼓作气　勇猛争先
    ——记梁锡芬和队友争夺军体五项冠军
    今天越野赛中的焦点是个人前三名的争夺。军事5项的越野赛程为8公里，成绩以28分钟定为1000分为基准。运动员每提前或落后1秒，增减1分，运动员按积分顺序，每隔1分钟单个起跑，积分高者后跑。这样，最后起跑的3名选手便依次为杨春义、班得拉和梁锡芬。他们之中杨春义越野成绩最好，班得拉和梁锡芬旗鼓相当。但杨春义的积分落后班得拉44.1分，而梁锡芬仅比班得拉领先2.8分，因此鹿死谁手就难以预料了。比赛中，杨春义奋勇争先，极力拉开与班得拉的距离，跑出26分51秒的成绩，比班得拉的27分27秒快得多，但总成绩还差6.7分，只好屈居第3。梁锡芬则咬紧牙关，紧盯班得拉不放，终于一鼓作气挺了下来，并以27分25秒的成绩超过班得拉4秒，总积分以6.8分之差战胜了对手。当梁锡芬最后一个冲过终点线后，人们立即喝起彩来，中国人赢了！不少友军选手拉梁锡芬和其它中国队员一起合影留念。在入场式中担任中国队前导的委内瑞拉姑娘里维罗热情地对记者说：“这几天，大家都在谈论中国队，他们的表现好极了，他们不但成绩好，而且作风好，纪律严明，我为他们感到骄傲。”比赛结束后，里维罗姑娘特意来到中国队驻地，送给每个队员一件小纪念品。
    赛后，中国代表团团长王志忠大校说：“我队劳师远征，在人生地不熟的情况下取得这样的成绩，说明运动员经受住了考验，这和军事5项队平时注意思想政治工作，严格管理，科学训练，内部团结是分不开的。”
