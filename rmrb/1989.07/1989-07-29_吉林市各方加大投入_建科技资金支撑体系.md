Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 29th.

Jilin City, Jilin Province, has mobilized various sectors to increase investment in science and technology, establishing a scientific and technological funding support system. Last year, the city proposed mobilizing all social forces to increase investment in science and technology, establishing a scientific and technological development fund of over 5.6 million yuan in one go, achieving good results.

The scientific and technological development fund established by Jilin City, with the support of the Jilin Provincial Science and Technology Commission, follows a 1:2 matching ratio for provincial, municipal, or county-level funds. For those who do not adhere to the matching principle, the funds will be recalled, and they will not be given projects for five years or will be criticized and exposed. Many enterprises in Jilin City have also allocated funds from their own resources, tax exemptions for new product development, and post-tax profits to set up enterprise development funds. This has formed a multi-channel, multi-level, and multi-dimensional scientific and technological funding support system in the city, including fiscal appropriations for scientific and technological three-item expenses, scientific and technological loans, scientific and technological business expenses, and social donations.

In July of this year, Jilin City further strengthened the scientific and technological funding support system by stipulating that the three-item expenses for scientific research, new product development, and intermediate trials should each account for more than 1% of the municipal fiscal normal expenditure annually. The scientific research fund should increase annually at a rate of 3% to 5% higher than the fiscal revenue.

    吉林市各方加大投入
    建科技资金支撑体系
    据新华社长春7月29日电  （通讯员钱曙林）吉林省吉林市为确保科技投入的资金，去年提出动员社会各方力量加大科技投入，建立了科技资金支撑体系，并一次性建立科技发展基金560多万元，取得了很好的效果。
    吉林市建立的科技发展资金，在吉林省科委的支持下，按照省、市或县1∶2的比例匹配，对不执行匹配原则者，将给予收回资金、5年内不给项目或通报批评的处理。吉林市许多企业还从自有资金、开发新产品减免税、税后留利中提出资金，设立了企业开发基金，从而在全市形成了包括财政拨款的科技三项费用、科技贷款、科技事业费及社会捐款在内的多渠道、多层次、多方位的科技资金支撑体系。
    今年7月，吉林市为进一步强化科技资金支撑体系，又规定科研、新产品开发、中间试验等三项费用，每年要达到市级财政正常支出的1％以上；科研费每年要按高出财政收入3％到5％的速度递增。
