Indian ancient scientists once calculated that in 1989, our planet was 1,972,949,008 years old.

Recently, with the aid of modern technology and the latest methods for studying the Earth's geological structure, these conclusions have been completely verified. This was announced by the director of the Indian Ancient Botany Research Institute, Venkatachar. He pointed out that this is not the only proof of the correctness of the conclusions of Indian ancient scientists. Their theories about the origin of the universe have also been completely verified. For example, ancient scientists believed that initially, there was no universe, only a primordial particle. Due to its extremely high density, 15 billion years ago, the particle exploded. The result of the explosion was the formation of the universe. Of course, to this day, no one can explain how they uncovered the secrets of the universe's origin and obtained the correct answers to many questions.

    地球约二十亿岁
    印度古代科学家曾计算出，一九八九年我们的星球满十九亿七千二百九十四万九千零八岁。
    不久前，借助现代技术和使用研究地球地质结构的最新方法进行的计算，完全证实了它们的结论。这是印度古植物学研究所所长文卡塔查尔宣布的。他指出，这不是对印度古代科学家结论正确性的唯一证明。他们关于宇宙产生的理论也完全得到证实。例如，古代科学家认为，起初不存在宇宙，只存在某个原始粒子，由于它的超密实度，一百五十亿年以前粒子爆炸。爆炸结果形成宇宙。当然，至今谁也不能解释，他们是用什么方法揭开宇宙产生秘密和得出许多问题的正确答案的。
