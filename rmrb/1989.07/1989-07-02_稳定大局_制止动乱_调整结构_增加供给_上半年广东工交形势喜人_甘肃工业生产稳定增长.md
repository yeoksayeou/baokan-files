	This year, Guangdong Province's industrial and commercial enterprises have adhered to reform and opening up, and in accordance with the provincial party committee's deployment at the end of April to prevent turmoil and stabilize the overall situation, they have ensured a balanced and stable development trend in industrial and commercial production.

	According to statistics, in the first half of this year, the province's total industrial output value increased by more than 25% compared to the same period last year. In the first five months of this year, the cumulative budgetary internal state-owned industrial profits and taxes, and the profits and taxes handed over, increased by 26.62% and 31.49% respectively compared to the same period last year. The total retail sales of social commodities exceeded 29.6 billion yuan, an increase of 28% compared to the same period last year, playing an important role in stabilizing public sentiment and the overall situation in the province.

	The People's Daily, Lanzhou, July 2nd: Correspondent Zhang Shusheng reported: Gansu Province has implemented the policy of rectification and comprehensive deepening of reform, vigorously adjusted the industrial and product structure, and increased effective supply, maintaining stable growth in industrial and commercial production in the first half of the year.

	This year, the Northwest power grid has abundant electricity, and domestic raw material supply is tight, providing new development opportunities for Gansu's industry, which is known for its raw material industry advantages. The provincial party committee and government seized this favorable opportunity, sending a large number of cadres to the grassroots level to coordinate services, and to the greatest extent possible, solving various practical problems for enterprises. When turmoil occurred in the Lanzhou area and some enterprises' production was affected, they promptly educated the majority of workers to overcome difficulties, stick to their posts, and continue production, ensuring normal production order.
