Xinhua News Agency, Lusaka, July 23rd.

SWAPO Chairman Sam Nujoma today expressed optimism that his organization will secure an overwhelming victory in the upcoming November elections in Namibia.

In a televised address on Zambian television this morning, he stated that South Africa remains the sole threat to the conduct of free and fair elections in Namibia.

He said that South Africa is currently employing its "assassination squads and brutal police forces" to disrupt Namibia's independence process. However, he asserted that such intimidation will not prevent SWAPO from achieving victory in the forthcoming elections.

Nujoma recently visited the United Kingdom and France, two permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. He mentioned that he had requested both countries to help strengthen the United Nations Transition Assistance Group in Namibia.

He also pointed out that the current situation in Namibia is deteriorating, urgently necessitating the disbandment of South Africa's police forces in Namibia and the withdrawal of South African troops to their barracks in accordance with UN Resolution 435.

Nujoma concluded his one-week visit to Zambia and departed for Ethiopia to attend the summit of the Organization of African Unity.

    努乔马有信心在大选中获胜
    指出南非是纳米比亚自由公正选举的唯一威胁
    新华社卢萨卡7月23日电　西南非洲人民组织主席努乔马今天说，他对该组织今年11月在纳米比亚大选中以绝对优势获胜持乐观态度。
    他在今天上午在赞比亚电视台发表的电视讲话中说，南非仍然是对纳米比亚举行自由、公平选举的唯一威胁。
    他说，最近南非正利用它的“暗杀队和残忍的警察部队”破坏纳米比亚的独立进程，但是这种恫吓是阻止不住西南非洲人民组织取得即将来临的大选胜利的。
    努乔马最近曾出访联合国安理会常任理事国中的英、法两国。他说，他已要求两国设法确保联合国派驻纳米比亚的过渡时期援助团加强力量。
    他还指出，纳米比亚目前的形势正在恶化，迫切需要解散南非在纳米比亚的警察部队，并且让南非在那里的军队按联合国435号决议退入军营。
    努乔马今天结束对赞比亚的一周访问前往埃塞俄比亚出席非洲统一组织首脑会议。
