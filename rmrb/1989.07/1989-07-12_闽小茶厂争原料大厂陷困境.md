Small tea factories in Fujian's jasmine tea production areas are competing with large factories for raw materials, causing 12 state-owned large tea factories in the province to face difficulties.

Fujian's 12 state-owned tea factories have an annual processing capacity of 500,000 to 600,000 piculs of jasmine tea. Last year, due to a shortage of raw materials, they only processed 190,000 piculs. In contrast, rural small tea factories processed 380,000 piculs, more than double that of the state-owned factories. The largest tea factory in the country, the Fuzhou Tea Factory, has an annual processing capacity of 120,000 piculs, but last year it only produced 40,000 piculs. The Xiapu Tea Factory in Mindong also incurred a loss of 350,000 yuan last year due to a shortage of raw materials. This is unprecedented in Fujian's history.

It is understood that hundreds of small tea factories, operating under the guise of "township enterprises," are actually privately owned or jointly operated by a few individuals. These small tea factories drive up prices to compete for raw materials, and some produce shoddy goods, passing off inferior products as high-quality ones to make excessive profits.

    闽小茶厂争原料大厂陷困境
    新华社福州7月12日电　（记者孙静）福建省茉莉花茶产区一些农村小茶厂与大厂争原料，使全省12个国营大茶厂陷入困境。
    福建省12个国营茶厂的年加工能力为50至60万担茉莉花茶，去年由于原料不足，只加工了19万担；而农村小茶厂却加工了38万担，超过国营茶厂的一倍。全国规模最大的福州茶厂年加工能力12万担，去年只生产了4万多担，闽东的霞浦茶厂去年因原料不足而亏损35万元。国营茶厂亏损在福建历史上是没有过的。
    据了解，六七百家打着“乡镇企业”牌子的茶厂，实际上是个人或几个人合资经营的私营小茶厂。这些小茶厂抬价争购原料，有的粗制滥造，以次充好，谋取暴利。
