The Cuban Communist Party Central Committee Plenum Calls for Strict Party Discipline and Anti-Corruption
Three Senior Officials Removed or Expelled from Party

HAVANA, June 30 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Cuban Communist Party's official newspaper Granma, the Cuban Communist Party Central Committee held its 9th special plenary session on June 29. The session decided to expel former Major General Arnaldo Ochoa, who was involved in smuggling and drug trafficking, and former Minister of Transport Ulises Rosales, who was guilty of moral degradation.

Fidel Castro, the First Secretary of the Cuban Communist Party, presided over the meeting.

The resolution issued after the meeting stated that the illegal activities of Ochoa and Rosales seriously harmed the interests of the party, the state, and the people.

The resolution also called on the 500,000 members of the Cuban Communist Party to take action, strictly enforce party discipline, and thoroughly eliminate corruption to ensure the steady development of the revolutionary and construction cause.

CARACAS, June 30 (Reporter Zhu Manting) — The Cuban Communist Party Central Political Bureau issued a statement yesterday signed by Castro, announcing the removal of Minister of the Interior Jose Abrantes and appointing Coronel Ibarra as the new Minister of the Interior.

The statement said: "This personnel change is due to 'considering the serious errors committed by the leadership of the Interior Ministry, in which some officers engaged in drug trafficking for two and a half years without being detected and went unpunished. This is a great insult to the trust and confidence the people have placed in this department.' The new Minister of the Interior 'should take all measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors.'"

    古巴共产党中央全会号召
    严明党纪　清除腐败
    三名高级官员被撤职或开除党籍
    新华社哈瓦那6月30日电  据古巴共产党机关报《格拉玛报》报道，古巴共产党中央委员会29日举行第9次特别全会，决定把参与走私贩毒的前陆军中将奥乔亚和生活腐化堕落的前运输部长托拉尔瓦开除出党。
    古巴共产党第一书记菲德尔·卡斯特罗主持了这次会议。
    会后发表的决议指出，奥乔亚和托拉尔瓦的非法行为严重损害了党、国家和人民利益。
    决议还号召古巴50万共产党员行动起来，严明党的纪律，深入清除腐败，以保证革命和建设事业稳步发展。
    本报加拉加斯6月30日电记者朱满庭报道：古巴共产党中央政治局昨天发表一项由卡斯特罗签署的公报，决定撤销内务部长何塞·阿普兰特斯少将的职务，并任命科罗梅·伊巴拉为新的内务部长。
    公报说：这一人事变动是由于“考虑到内务部领导犯有严重错误，在两年半的时间内，（这个部门的）一些军官进行贩毒活动一直未被察觉而逍遥法外。这是对人民给予这个部门的信誉和信任的极大亵渎。”新任内务部长“应采取一切措施避免这种错误的重犯”。
