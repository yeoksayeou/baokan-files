The use of leeches to drain blood and successfully reattach severed fingers has been achieved by the orthopedic department of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Hubei Medical College. Experts believe that this method is a world first.

In 1987, the hospital treated a female patient whose eight fingers were completely severed for six hours. After the orthopedic doctors performed surgery to reattach the fingers, they boldly used leeches to draw out the accumulated blood, resulting in the survival of all eight severed fingers. To date, the hospital has used the leech therapy to save 13 patients' 14 severed fingers and 5 patients' transplanted skin flaps, with excellent results.

    湖北用蚂蝗吸血再植断指获成功
    据新华社武汉7月18日电　（记者罗辉、通讯员周凌）用蚂蝗吸血法救活再植断指，由湖北医学院附属第二医院骨科研究成功。有关专家认为，这种方法在国际上还属首创。
    1987年，湖医二院收治了一位8个手指完全断离6小时的女患者，骨科医生给她做了手术缝合后，大胆采用蚂蝗吸取淤血，使患者8个断指全部存活。到目前为止，这家医院用蚂蝗吸血法共救活了13例病人的14个断指和5例病人的移植皮瓣，效果非常好。
