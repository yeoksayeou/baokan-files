The letter of comfort states that as we celebrate the decisive victory in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital and as the people of the nation deeply study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, we are welcoming the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army. At this significant moment, we extend our sincere greetings and highest respect to you! We also convey the deep concern and warm regards of the Party, the government, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

The letter praises the Chinese People's Liberation Army as a force that serves the people wholeheartedly. It has made indelible historical contributions in the armed struggle to seize power and establish New China. In the struggle against aggression, defending the motherland, and building socialism, it has made tremendous new contributions. Especially during the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital on June 3rd and 4th, you did not let down the trust of the Party and the people, and swiftly quashed the riot. Practice has once again proven that you are indeed the loyal guardians of the republic.

The letter also states that the close relationship between the military and the government, and the military and the people, where they are as close as fish and water, and stand together in life and death, is an important guarantee for us to overcome all difficulties. The Ministry of Civil Affairs and all levels of civil affairs departments will continue to cherish and support the soldiers, and do a better job in supporting military families and veterans.
