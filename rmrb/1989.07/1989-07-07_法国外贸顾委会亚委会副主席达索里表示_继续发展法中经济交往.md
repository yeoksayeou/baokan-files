	French Foreign Trade Advisory Committee's Asia Subcommittee Vice Chairman André Dassault emphasized the importance of maintaining economic and trade relations with China, aiming to continuously enhance economic and cultural exchanges between the two peoples.

	Dassault made these remarks on June 27 at a seminar on "Chinese Patents and Inventions" held in Paris. He said that it was a pleasure to participate in today's activities and discuss China's economic legal issues at a time when the situation in China is complex. Dassault noted that a recent document issued by the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade indicates that China's economic policies will not change. It aligns with the policies announced at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, which stated that all of China's external economic and trade activities will be maintained and further expanded and developed. Recently, Deng Xiaoping also pointed out that the economic reform and opening-up policy proposed at the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee in 1978 is correct, and China will continue to adhere to it firmly.

	Dassault added that, according to information provided by the Franco-Chinese Committee's offices in various parts of China, especially from the French and Chinese Ministries of Foreign Economic Trade, all contracts signed between China and foreign countries will continue to be executed.

	Dassault mentioned that the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade continues to send patent and trademark delegations to participate in the annual meetings of the International Licensing Executives Society and the International Association for the Protection of Industrial Property held in Sweden and the Netherlands. They also held seminars in the UK and France to discuss investment, patent, and trademark issues with foreign counterparts. This demonstrates China's willingness to continue opening up to the outside world. French experts in economic law also participated in the seminar, indicating the French business and legal communities' goodwill towards developing economic and cultural relations with the Chinese people.

	In conclusion, Dassault said, we hope to maintain economic exchanges with China, continuously developing economic relations between the French and Chinese peoples. We do not interfere in China's internal affairs. We ask today's participants to continue to be enthusiastic about Franco-Chinese cooperation. China and the Chinese people need this cooperation. We should not adopt an ostrich policy.

    法国外贸顾委会亚委会副主席达索里表示
    继续发展法中经济交往
    本报巴黎七月五日电　据七月初在巴黎出版的《欧洲时报》报道，法国全国外贸顾问委员会亚洲委员会副主席安德烈·达索里强调，希望维持与中国的经济贸易关系，使两国人民之间的经济文化交往得到不断提高和发展。
    达索里是六月二十七日在巴黎举行“中国专利与发明”研讨会上说上述这一番话的。他说，在目前中国形势多事之时，能参加今天的活动并讨论中国的经济法律问题，我感到十分高兴。达索里说，中国贸促会最近发布的一个文件表明，中国的经济政策将不会改变。它也符合中国共产党十三届四中全会所宣布的政策：其中提到中国所有对外经济与贸易活动都将维持，而且还将不断扩大和发展。最近，邓小平也指出：一九七八年召开的十一届三中全会提出的经济改革与对外开放政策是正确的，中国将一如既往，坚定不移地进行下去。
    达索里接着说，根据法中委员会在中国各地代表处提供的信息，特别是从法国与中国的对外经济贸易部来的信息，中国与外国所签订的一切合同，都将继续执行。
    达索里说，中国贸促会继续派出专利与商标代表团，参加了在瑞典、荷兰举行的国际许可证执行人协会、国际保护工业产权协会两个国际会议年会，并到英国和法国举行专题报告会，与外国同行洽谈投资、专利、商标问题，这证明了中国是愿意继续对外开放的。法国的经济法学专家也参加研讨会，这表明了法国企业界、司法界对与中国人民发展经济、文化关系的良好愿望。
    达索里副主席最后说，总之，我们是希望维持与中国的经济交往，使法中两国人民之间的经济关系不断发展。我们不干涉中国内政。请今天的与会者继续热心于法中合作，中国、中国人民需要这种合作。我们不应该采取一种“驼鸟”政策。
