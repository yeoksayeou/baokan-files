Title: Focusing on the Market for Production

In commodity production, efforts to improve the local environment are like artificial rain in a drought-stricken area, often effective for small-scale economic development. This has been proven by practices in places like Luoyuan Village in Guannan County. However, commodity production ultimately cannot do without the broader market. Improvements in the local environment must be closely linked to the broader market; otherwise, not only will benefits not be gained, but losses may also be incurred.

As the saying goes, "Every ten miles, the sky changes." The market is vast, far exceeding ten or even a hundred miles, and it is inevitable that there will be "unexpected changes." The local environment must adapt to the changes in the market. In other words, one must respond to change with change, rather than remaining static in the face of constant change. When unexpected situations arise in the market, one must remain calm and composed, not panic. One must identify the root cause and then apply the appropriate remedy. If the issue is with raw materials, efforts must be made to tap into resource potential; if the issue is with product quality, management must be tightened; if the issue is with sales channels, efforts must be made to smooth out the channels of circulation. Regardless of the storms, one must remain steadfast, planning ahead and ensuring that the local environment aligns with the broader market.

How can individual farmers cope with the vast market? Relying on individual efforts is not enough; even with three heads and six arms, a single household cannot manage all aspects of production, circulation, storage, transportation, and processing. The solution is to form alliances on a voluntary and mutually beneficial basis. If the collective economy is strong, then villages and townships should establish and improve service systems; if the process of specialized development is rapid, then various enterprises should establish series service organizations. These organizations can also engage in cross-regional cooperation. With their own organizations, farmers can connect production with the market, keeping an eye on all directions and ears open to all sides, with stronger capabilities and more methods, naturally reducing the losses caused by market fluctuations.

Efforts to improve the local environment are not about making one's own region or unit self-sufficient in all respects. Only by leveraging strengths and avoiding weaknesses can steady progress be made; self-isolation will only result in doubled efforts and halved results. Take the development of livestock and poultry production as an example. Rural areas have the advantage of solving feed issues, while large and medium-sized cities have the advantage of opening up sales channels. If both sides divide labor and complement each other, they can develop together; if both sides emphasize self-sufficiency, they may end up harming each other. One of the main reasons for the decline in poultry and egg production in the first half of this year was that some cities overemphasized "self-sufficiency," causing the region to disconnect from the broader market, ultimately affecting production. This lesson is worth remembering.

    盯着市场搞生产
    万兴
    在商品生产中努力改善局部环境，正如老天爷久旱无雨，局部地区搞一次或几次人工降雨一样，对小范围的经济发展往往很起作用。这已为灌云县罗圩村这样一些单位的实践所证明。但是，商品生产终归离不开大市场，局部环境的改善，必须注意与大市场紧密相连，如果二者脱节，那就不光得不到好处，还可能要吃大亏哩。
    俗语说：十里不同天。市场之大，岂止十里、百里，免不了常有“不测风云”。局部环境一定要适应市场的风云变化。也就是说要以“变”应“变”，不能以不变应万变。每当市场出现意想不到的情况时，要沉着冷静，不能自己先乱了锣鼓点。要看准了病因再对症下药。是原料问题，就下力气挖掘资源潜力；是产品质量问题，就认真抓管理；是销路阻滞，就想办法疏导流通渠道。任凭风浪起，稳坐钓鱼台，走一步看两步，小环境自然能与大市场合拍。
    单枪匹马的农户怎样应付茫茫的市场？靠单打独拚不行，一家一户就是有三头六臂，也照应不了生产、流通、储运、加工等方方面面。出路就是在自愿互利的前提下搞联合，集体经济实力雄厚，就以村、乡为单位建立健全服务体系；专业化发展进程较快，就以各种企业为单位建立系列服务组织。这些组织还可以搞跨地区的合作。农民有了自己的组织，生产与市场就接通了，眼观六路，耳听八方，力量强，办法多，自然可以有效地减少市场波动带来的损失。
    努力改善局部环境，绝非是把本地区、本单位搞成一个万事不求人的“小而全”。扬长避短，方能稳步向前；自我封闭只能事倍功半。就以发展畜禽生产为例，广大乡村有解决饲料的优势，大中城市郊区有开拓销路的优势，如果二者各有分工、互补互济，就能共同发展；倘若都强调以我为主，恐怕就要两败俱伤。今年上半年禽蛋生产滑坡，其中重要原因之一就是有的城市过分强调了“自给”，使本地区与大市场脱了节，反倒影响了生产。这个教训值得记取。
