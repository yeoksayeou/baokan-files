    Guizhou Establishes a Four-Tier Maternal and Child Health Network
    Our reporter Wang Nemei reports: Since 1985, Guizhou Province has implemented target management for maternal and child health across the province. Through four years of unremitting efforts, a four-tier maternal and child health network at the provincial, county, township, and village levels has been initially established. In 1987, the rate of deliveries attended by trained personnel reached 74.57%. For the first time in 20 years, several counties have achieved universal trained delivery services. The systematic management registration rate for urban pregnant and postpartum women has reached 76%, and the hospital delivery rate in the urban areas of Guiyang, Zunyi, and Duyun is 99.8%. The perinatal mortality rate is 15.9‰.

    The systematic management rate for children aged 0-7 in the urban areas of Guiyang has reached 90%, and the neonatal mortality rate has decreased to 7.32‰.
