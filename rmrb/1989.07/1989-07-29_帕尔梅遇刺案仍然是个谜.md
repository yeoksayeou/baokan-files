The assassination of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, which shocked the world, has been nearly three and a half years. After the Stockholm District Court sentenced 42-year-old Christer Pettersson to life imprisonment, a significant portion of Swedes did not find solace in the capture of the prime minister's assassin. Instead, they fell into new confusion due to doubts about the court's verdict.

The court passed the verdict with a 6-2 majority. Six non-professional jurors and two professional judges had differing opinions. The former relied on the testimonies of over 30 witnesses, particularly Palme's widow confirming that Pettersson was a few steps away when the gunshot was heard, concluding that Pettersson was the culprit. The latter, however, believed that the current evidence was circumstantial, lacking physical evidence, and that no witness saw Pettersson firing or holding a gun. They argued that Palme's wife's testimony was given in a state of extreme panic and that memories after three years could not be a crucial basis for the verdict. They advocated for Pettersson's acquittal. The significant discrepancy between the professional judges and the jurors surprised everyone here.

Last night, Swedish television received over 3,000 calls, with more than 2,000 people not believing that Pettersson was the real assassin. Swedish radio reporters conducted street interviews, and most people expressed doubts about the court's verdict. Pettersson has appealed the decision.

Since the number of professional judges in the higher court exceeds that of non-professional jurors, some legal experts hope that the district court's verdict will be overturned by the higher court.

This case leaves many questions unanswered. Pettersson has an unappealing appearance, has committed murder before, and has been imprisoned three times. However, this cannot be used as evidence to judge that he assassinated Palme. Some accuse him of being mentally unstable, but according to medical examinations, he is mentally sound and quite talkative. During the trial, he appeared calm, listened attentively, and occasionally took notes. In court, he repeatedly stated that he was not the killer. If he had assassinated Palme, what would his motive be? According to police investigations, he had no personal grudges with Palme, always voted for Palme's Social Democratic Party in elections, and no links were found between him and any political organizations or foreign groups. The prosecutor could not provide a convincing motive for the murder in court, and the court's verdict also avoided this issue.

Since the assassination of Palme, the Swedish judicial authorities, despite deploying a large number of personnel (up to over 300 people) and financial resources (over 100 million kronor, approximately $16 million), have faced significant difficulties in the investigation due to the lack of effective measures at the time of the incident. Reports indicate that police arrived at the scene 6 minutes after Palme was shot; the crime scene protection perimeter was too small, and two bullets were picked up by pedestrians outside the perimeter; two subway trains passed through the scene without being checked; the border was not immediately sealed; the police chief continued his ski vacation in the mountains the day after the incident, etc. Subsequently, the police exerted considerable effort in the investigation, and the public provided numerous leads, but those arrested were all released due to insufficient evidence. The former Swedish Minister of Justice, Police Chief, and District Prosecutor were dismissed for mishandling or improper methods in dealing with this case.

Now, everyone is awaiting the verdict from the higher court.

    帕尔梅遇刺案仍然是个谜
    本报记者　顾耀铭
    震惊世界的瑞典前首相帕尔梅遇刺案已历时近3年半，当斯德哥尔摩地方法院宣布判处42岁的彼特松终身监禁后，相当一部分瑞典人并没有因为杀害首相的刺客被擒而宽慰，相反由于对法庭的裁决产生怀疑而陷入新的困惑。
    法院是以6∶2通过了这项裁决。6名非专职的陪审官与2名专职法官意见相左。前者依据30多名证人的证词，特别是帕尔梅遗孀确认彼特松是在枪声响后离她几步远的人，断定彼特松是凶手。后者却认为目前所获都是情况证据，缺乏物证，所有证人中无人看到彼特松开枪或持枪，帕尔梅夫人的证言是极度惊慌中所见，并且时隔3年的记忆，不能作为裁决的重要依据，主张给予彼特松无罪释放。专职法官与陪审官之间意见悬殊如此之大，使这里的人们都感到惊讶。
    昨天晚上，瑞典电视台接到3000多人的电话，其中2000多人不认为彼特松是真正的凶手。瑞典电台记者到街头采访，大多数人对法院裁决表示怀疑。彼特松已提出上诉。
    由于上级法院专职法官的人数超过非专职的陪审官，因此，一些法学界人士期待着地方法院的裁决将被上级法院否决。
    此案留下疑问颇多。彼特松相貌不善，曾犯过杀人罪，坐了3次牢，但是这不能作为判断他谋杀帕尔梅的依据。有人指控他精神不正常，但据法医检查，他反应正常，很善谈。在审判过程中，他表现得比较沉着，认真地听，不时记笔记。在法庭上他一再表示他不是凶手。如果是他刺杀帕尔梅，其杀人动机是什么？据警方调查，他同帕尔梅没有任何私人恩怨，历次选举他都向帕尔梅所属的社民党投赞成票，也没有发现他同任何政治组织或外国集团有联系。在法庭上检察官对他提不出有说服力的杀人动机，法院的裁决书也回避了这个问题。
    帕尔梅遇刺案发生以来，瑞典司法部门虽然动用了大量人力（最多时300多人），财力（1亿多克朗约合1600万美元）去侦查，但是由于案发之时未采取有效措施，给侦破工作带来很大困难。据报道，帕尔梅被刺6分钟后警察才赶到出事点；现场保护圈划得很小，两颗弹头还是行人在保护圈外拣到的；两列地铁先后未受检查从出事点附近通过；边界也未立即封锁；警察署长在出事后第二天继续在山上滑雪度假，等等。事后，警方下了很大力量侦查，群众也纷纷提供线索，逮捕的一些人均因证据不足而被一一释放。瑞典前任司法部长、警察署长、地方检察长因处理此案不力或方法不当而被解职。
    现在，人们都在期待着上级法院的裁决。
