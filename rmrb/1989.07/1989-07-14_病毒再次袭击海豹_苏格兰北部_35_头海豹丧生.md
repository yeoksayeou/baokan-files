A new environmental disaster is wreaking havoc around the Orkney Islands in Britain. By around July 4, a contagious virus among animals continues to threaten the lives of thousands of British seals.

This virus rampaged along the eastern coast of Britain last year, claiming the lives of 600 to 700 common seals in the region. This year, animal rescuers fear that the virus has returned, targeting the newborn offspring of the surviving seals.

Their fears have been realized. At the beginning of the breeding season, in the two weeks from the end of June to the beginning of July, 35 seals in the Orkney Islands of northern Scotland have already been infected and died. Thus, the hope that the seals that survived last year's disaster might have developed immunity to this virus has been dashed.

    病毒再次袭击海豹
    苏格兰北部35头海豹丧生
    本报伦敦7月13日电　一种新的环境灾难又在英国奥克尼群岛周围肆虐。到7月4日前后，一种兽类传染性病毒仍对成千英国海豹生命构成着威胁。
    这种病毒去年曾横行英国东海岸，夺去了这一地区600头至700头普通海豹的生命。今年，动物救护人员担心这种病毒又卷土重来，侵袭那些幸存海豹的新生儿。
    他们的担心终于发生了。在产仔季节一开始，苏格兰北部奥克尼群岛一带，在6月底到7月上旬两周内，就已有35头海豹受感染而丧生。这样，经过去年灾难而幸存的海豹可能已具备对这种病毒的免疫力的希望破灭了。
