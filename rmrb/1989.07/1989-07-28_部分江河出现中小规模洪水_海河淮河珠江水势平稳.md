Some major rivers in China have recently experienced medium to small-scale floods, but the water levels in the Haihe, Huaihe, and Zhujiang rivers remain stable.

According to information provided today by the office of the National Flood Control Headquarters, several major rivers in China have recently seen medium to small-scale floods. However, the water levels in the Haihe, Huaihe, and Zhujiang rivers are stable.

In the western part of Sichuan, which is located upstream of the Yangtze River, heavy rains have been falling for several days. By 12:00 on July 27th, the Minjiang River, a tributary of the Yangtze, experienced a flood peak with a flow rate of 28,500 cubic meters per second. According to analysis, after the Minjiang River's floodwater converges with the floodwaters from tributaries such as the Jinsha River and the Jialing River, the Yangtze River's main channel at the Yichang station is expected to experience the second flood peak of the year on July 30th, with a flow rate of approximately 50,000 cubic meters per second. This is slightly less than the flow rate of the first flood of the year.

The second flood peak of the Yellow River passed through the Luokou station in Jinan at 11:00 on July 27th, with a peak flow rate of 5,000 cubic meters per second, which is classified as a medium to small flood. No major hazards have been reported in the lower reaches of the Yellow River.

Due to continuous rainfall in the Xinganling region, the flow rate at the Tongliao station on the Nenjiang River's main channel reached 7,650 cubic meters per second at 3:00 on July 28th, approaching the peak flow rate. It is expected that this will form the third-largest flood since the founding of the nation. The flood peak is expected to reach Qiqihar on July 30th, at which time the water level is expected to be approximately 0.5 meters lower than last year.

The flood peak of the Liaohe River passed through the Tieling station at 9:00 on July 27th, with a peak flow rate of 1,890 cubic meters per second, which is less than the flood flow rate in 1986.

    部分江河出现中小规模洪水
    海河淮河珠江水势平稳
    新华社北京7月28日电　（记者赵鹏、通讯员袁建军）据国家防汛总指挥部办公室今天提供消息，我国几条主要江河近日出现中小规模洪水，但海河、淮河、珠江水势平稳。
    位于长江上游的四川西部地区近日连降暴雨，27日12时，长江支流岷江出现流量为28500立方米每秒的洪峰。据分析，岷江的洪水同金沙江、嘉陵江等支流的洪水汇合后，长江干流宜昌站将在30日出现今年长江的第二次洪峰，流量约为5万立方米每秒，小于今年第一次洪水流量。
    黄河今年第二次洪峰已于27日11时通过济南市洛口站，洪峰流量为5000立方米每秒，属黄河中小洪水，黄河下游未出现重大险情。
    由于兴安岭地区连日降雨，嫩江干流同盟站28日3时流量涨至7650立方米每秒，已接近形成洪峰流量，预计将形成建国以来第三位洪水。洪峰将于30日到达齐齐哈尔，届时水位约比去年低0.5米左右。
    辽河洪峰已于27日9时通过铁岭站，洪峰流量为1890立方米每秒，小于1986年洪水流量。
