Jilin Province, based on its accumulated experience, has decided to address the shortcomings of current contracting methods by piloting a new approach: full-employee asset contracting. This initiative aims to explore new forms of public ownership.

Full-employee asset contracting begins with the formation of a contracting organization by the state-owned asset management department and the enterprise's supervisory department. This organization evaluates the enterprise's assets and, in reference to the average fixed asset profit rate of similar enterprises in the same industry, determines the contracting base. Considering the production and operational status of the pilot enterprise, the organization sets operational goals, which are then discussed and voted on by the workers' congress. The workers' congress selects a resource contracting working committee to represent the workers in signing the first phase of the contracting agreement with the contracting party. If a majority of the worker representatives disagree with the terms, the state-owned asset contracting department will be responsible for re-contracting the enterprise through asset or equity transfer, implementing enterprise-to-enterprise contracting or mergers.

Once the first phase of the contracting agreement is signed, the resource contracting working committee hires an operator. The workers' congress then votes to confirm the successful candidate.

Under this contracting method, workers pay a fixed asset occupancy mortgage fee at a certain percentage of the fixed assets. The operator pays an operational risk mortgage fee equivalent to the highest reward amount. The enterprise also sets aside an enterprise risk fund from its retained profits annually.

Most enterprises in Jilin Province will reach the end of their current contracting period by next year. The province plans to make full-employee asset contracting a key part of its efforts to improve and reform the contracting system, implementing it steadily across various regions and departments.

### 探索全民所有制新形式  吉林试行全员资产承包

    探索全民所有制新形式
    吉林试行全员资产承包
    本报讯　吉林省在总结经验的基础上，针对当前承包办法的缺陷，决定进行新的承包方式——全员资产承包的试点，探索全民所有制新形式。
    全员资产承包，首先由国有资产管理部门和企业主管部门组成发包组织，对企业资产进行评估，并参照同行业、同类企业平均固定资产利润率确定承包基数，结合试点企业的生产经营状况，确定经营目标，提交职工代表大会讨论、表决，然后由职代会选出的资产承包工作委员会代表职工与发包方签订第一段承包合同。如果大多数职工代表不同意接标，则以经营权或产权转让的形式，由国有资产发包部门负责向社会另行发包，实行企业包企业或兼并。第一段承包合同签订后，再由资产承包工作委员会招聘经营者，经职代会表决，确定中标人。
    实行这种承包，职工要按固定资产的一定比例，均等交纳资产占用抵押金；经营者交纳与最高奖励数额大体对等的经营风险抵押金；企业还从留利中逐年提取企业风险基金。
    吉林省大部分企业明年到承包期限后，省里将把全员资产承包试点作为完善和改造承包制的一项重要工作，在各地、各部门中稳妥进行。
