Romania has enacted laws to protect farmland from being used for industrial and urban residential construction. The laws stipulate that land must be used efficiently and that new farmland must be developed to compensate for any farmland that is lost.

As early as 1974, the Great National Assembly of Romania passed the Land Law, which stipulated that construction units must convert an equal area of swampy land, barren land, or unused roads into new farmland when they occupy farmland. This ensures that the area of cultivated land does not decrease.

However, there have been instances where these regulations were violated. Since 1975, the total area of cultivated land in Romania has decreased by nearly 300,000 hectares. The Political Executive Committee of the Romanian Communist Party held a meeting on May 19 of this year to severely criticize the phenomenon of excessive occupation of farmland. Romania plans to increase its cultivated land area by 500,000 hectares during the current five-year plan period (1986-1990).

    罗马尼亚为保护农田制订法律
    罗马尼亚为工业和城乡住宅建设占用农田制订法律，规定节约用地并通过开发新农田，以弥补被占农田的损失。
    早在1974年罗大国民议会通过了土地法，规定基建单位在占用农田的同时必须把相同面积的沼泽地、贫瘠土地或无用道路等改造为新农田，从而使耕种土地的面积不因此减少。
    然而，违反上述规定的现象却时有发生。自1975年以来，罗全国耕地面积已减少了近30万公顷。罗共中央政治执委会于今年5月19日开会对滥占耕地的现象给予严厉批评。罗计划在本五年计划期间（1986—1990年）使耕地面积扩大50万公顷。　（新华社）
