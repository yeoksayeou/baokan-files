Summer is the season of the great ocean, and it is also the season of prosperity for the bay.

Maluan Bay, which has been quiet for a winter and a spring, is starting to buzz with activity again. By eight or nine in the morning, the semi-circular parking lot behind the bay is already filled with tour buses and private cars. The heat from the scorching asphalt road diminishes as you turn into the bay entrance. Stepping onto the sandy beach, the view suddenly opens up, and the heart feels expansive. Behind you is a lush green belt of casuarina trees, and in front of you is a semi-circular bay. The hazy horizon where the sea meets the sky is the Taiwan Strait, and the misty peaks are one of Dongshan's scenic spots: "Sufeng Arching Jade." This place is only two kilometers from Dongshan's city center, with a beach that is 2,500 meters long and 60 meters wide. Especially the sand under your feet, which is as fine as powder and as white as snow, seems to shimmer with rainbow hues under the sunlight. Add to that the blue sky, green water, dense forest, beautiful waves, strange reefs, and bizarre rocks, and the scenery is exceptionally charming. No wonder visitors to Dongshan Island, including returning overseas Chinese and foreign guests, are eager to visit here. It seems that if you don't go to Maluan Bay, you haven't truly been to Dongshan Island. As for the locals in Dongshan's city center, they are truly "near the water and the moon first."

The development of Maluan Bay is a recent endeavor. There is a legend about it. It is said that during the late Southern Song Dynasty, Emperor Zhao Bing rode his horse past here. One evening, he saw a strange sight of flames rising in the distance. His horse suddenly stopped and refused to move. At that moment, an elder from the village came out to welcome him and asked for a name for the village. Zhao Bing thought for a moment and said, "My horse stopped here, perhaps it is fond of this place. You can name your village 'Malian'." Later, people found the word "lian" too vulgar, and since the imperial carriage had passed through, they changed the village name to "Maluan Village." Maluan Bay thus got its name.

However, for a long time, Maluan Bay did not attract much attention. Because in Dongshan, there are seven large bays like this, and dozens of smaller ones. Although it is close to the city center, it is a secluded place, unknown to many. The locals used to gather and rest at Nanmen Beach. During the summer, the streets and alleys of Wahuai were sweltering, and people liked to go to Nanmen Beach to enjoy the moonlight, feel the sea breeze, or even secretly dip into the sea for half a day. After 1985, with the acceleration of the reform and opening-up process, people's horizons expanded, and they finally discovered that Maluan Bay is a great place for tourism, sightseeing, and summer vacations. From that time on, Maluan Bay was listed as one of the key tourist areas for development in Fujian Province. Now, tens of millions of yuan have been invested, and water, electricity, transportation, and other tourism facilities have been fully equipped. There are parking lots, cold drink stalls, seafood restaurants, shower rooms, libraries, dance halls, seaside guest rooms, meeting rooms, tent areas, beach baths, movie theaters, and sea entertainment rental services.

From eight or nine in the morning, people start going into the water, and the number of beachgoers keeps increasing. Splash, splash, the swimmers are like dumplings falling into a pot. You can hear the bright blue laughter from the water and see the waves rolling open like Persian lilies. The sunlight shining on the waves brightens the chests of the girls and the broad shoulders of the young men. On the soft sand, there are already groups of beachgoers resting under the dappled shadows of the casuarina trees. Umbrellas are like bird nests, hatching sweeter first loves than watermelons or soda. The fun continues until the sun sets in the west. At night, Maluan Bay takes on another scene. Some people rent tents and enjoy the wild fun of camping; the dance hall lights flash, and to the sound of the waves, disco music plays, and young men and women rarely get the chance to dance lightly here to delight their bodies and minds. The couples in love in the city center are even more eager to make Maluan Bay their perfect place for romance. In the past, it was "meeting at dusk," but now it is "meeting at Maluan Bay." From the beach forest, you can occasionally hear the girl's coquettish laughter, the man's hearty laughter, and more often, the sweet whispers. The bay under the moonlight is shrouded in a mysterious color, vague and indistinct, with a charming hazy beauty.

What is even more distinctive here is that the entertainment rental service not only rents air mattresses, swimsuits, life rings, and water balls but also rents boats. During the day, tourists can take a boat to the small islands in the sea to sightsee, fish, pick snails, have picnics, and barbecue. Cooking utensils, fishing gear, and fishing equipment can be brought or rented. In the evening, if you are interested, the entertainment service can also provide fishing nets and arrange for fishermen to guide you to fish in Maluan Bay. From casting the net to pulling it in, it only takes half an hour. Lucky ones can catch hundreds of pounds of fish each time, and the fish caught are all for the tourists to barbecue and enjoy. This project is particularly attractive to foreigners. Once, it rained a little, and a blonde foreign woman imitated the Chinese fishermen, wearing a raincoat and a rain hat, standing at the bow of the boat with the fishermen casting and pulling the net, playing happily and not afraid to get her body wet. Now, people from more than ten countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Australia, India, Jordan, Peru, and Sri Lanka, have visited Maluan Bay. The sand at Maluan Bay beach is clean and white, and the sea water is clear and refreshing... There are no large sharks here, so tourists do not need to be afraid.

I have been to Maluan Bay several times, and each time I was warmly received. The water here is good, and so are the people; the scenery is beautiful, and so are the hearts of the people. When I was swimming in the bay, the island's fisherman poet took a few color photos of me. One of them is of me swimming in the deep blue sea, and I specially enlarged it and framed it in a glass frame. Every time I look at it, I can't help but think, "Hello, Maluan Bay!"

    马銮湾之夏
    陈文和
    夏是大海的季节，也是海湾繁茂的季节。
    寂静了一个冬春的马銮湾，又开始喧闹起来了。上午八九点以后，湾后那个半月形的停车场，已经排列着游览的旅行车和小轿车。从热得滚烫的柏油路拐进湾口，热气顿减了好多。步入沙滩，视野顿时为之开阔，胸襟也为之旷达。背后是苍绿的木麻黄林带，前面是半月形的海湾，那迷蒙的一望无际的海天交接处，是台湾海峡，那云雾缭绕的是东山的胜景之一：“苏峰拱秀”。这里距东山城关才二公里，沙滩长2500米，宽60米，特别是那脚下的沙子，细如粉末，白得似雪，在阳光下似乎闪着一道道虹光。再加上天蓝、水绿、林密、浪美、礁奇、石怪，风光分外旎旖秀丽。难怪到东山岛的外地客人，包括归国华侨和外宾，都乐意到此一游，似乎不到海銮湾就不算到东山岛。至于东山城关本地人，更是“近水楼台先得月”了。
    马銮湾的开发是近几年的事。它曾有这么一个传说，相传南宋末年，宋帝昺曾骑马路过这里，那天正当黄昏，不远处忽地发现有火光升腾的奇景，他胯下的马竟停蹄不前。这时恰好村内长者出来迎驾，并请赐村名。赵昺寻思片刻说：“我的马在此停足，想必是留恋此地，你们的村名就叫马恋可也。”后来，人们嫌“恋”字落俗，加上皇帝銮驾到此，便改村名为“马銮村”。马銮湾也因此而得名。
    但是长期以来，马銮湾并没有引起人们的注目。因为在东山，像这样大的海湾就有七个，小海湾则有几十个。这里虽靠近城关，却是个偏僻去处，默默无闻。城关人过去聚集休憩的地点是南门沙滩。每当暑天，瓦屋街巷，热浪逼人，人们都喜欢就近到南门沙滩赏赏月色，吹吹海风，甚或偷偷浸到海里去泡它半天。1985年后，随着改革开放步伐的加速，人们的视线也扩大了，终于发现马銮湾是个旅游观光、避暑度假的胜地。从那时候起，马銮湾便被列为福建省重点开发的旅游区之一。现已投资几十万元，水电、交通及其他旅游设施均已配套，设有停车场、冷饮厅、海味餐馆、冲浴室、图书室、舞厅、滨海客房、会议室、帐篷区、海浴场、录像放映场、海上游乐出租处等。
    从上午八九时过后，海湾就开始有人下水了，而且海浴的人越来越多。扑嗵，扑嗵，入浴者真有如落锅的元宵。听水里时时绽出蓝亮的笑声，看浪涛深处卷发绽开如波斯菊。踏浪而来的阳光镀亮了少女的胸脯，也镀亮了小伙子们的宽肩。而松软的沙滩上，已有三三两两的浴者，憩息在木麻黄下斑驳的树影里。阳伞有如鸟巢，孵着比西瓜、汽水还要甜蜜的初恋。游嬉持续到太阳落西为止。到了夜晚，马銮湾又有另一番景象。有人租来帐篷，过着野趣横生的露宿生活；舞厅灯光闪烁，和着涛声，奏起了迪斯科舞曲，青年男女难得在这里踏起轻盈的舞步，以娱悦身心。城关那些处在热恋中的对对情侣，更是把海銮湾当为谈情说爱的绝好去处。过去是“人约黄昏后”，现在是“人约马銮湾”。从海滩密林里，偶尔会传出少女的娇嗔，男性的阔笑，更多的是甜蜜的窃窃私语。月光下的海湾蒙上一层神秘的色彩，模模糊糊，隐隐约约，具有一种迷人的朦胧美。
    这里更加别开生面的是：游乐出租处除出租气垫床、游泳衣裤、救生圈、水球外，还有游艇出租。白天，旅客乘着游艇可到海中小岛屿去观光、钓鱼、摸螺、野炊、烧烤，炊具、钓具和渔具可自带也可租用。傍晚，如果你有兴趣，游乐处还可提供渔网，派渔民专门指导，让游客在马銮湾乘船打鱼，从撒网到拉网只需半个小时，幸运者每次可捕鱼上百斤，打来的鱼全归游客自己烧烤品尝。这个项目特别吸引了外宾。有一回下了小雨，一位金发碧眼的外国女郎，学着中国渔民的样子，戴斗笠、披蓑衣，站在船头随同渔民撒网拉网，玩得津津有味，也不怕把身子弄湿了。现在到过马銮湾的已有美国、英国、法国、澳大利亚、印度、约旦、秘鲁、斯里兰卡等十多个国家的友人。马銮湾沙滩浴场的沙子洁净细白，海水清冽……这里没有大鲨鱼出没，游客不用担惊受怕。
    我已数次到过马銮湾，每次到来都受到热情的接待。这里水情好，人情也好；风景美，人心也美。当我在湾里游泳时，岛上渔民诗人曾给我拍了几张彩照，其中一张是我在湛蓝的大海里划水的姿态，我特地把它放大，镶在玻璃镜框里。每当我抬头看它时，在心底里都不由得涌出一句话：“你好，马銮湾！”
