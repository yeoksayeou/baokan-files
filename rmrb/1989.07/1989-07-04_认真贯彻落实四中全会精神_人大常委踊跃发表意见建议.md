The eighth meeting of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress was held this afternoon, where members spoke freely about their understanding of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and offered suggestions on how to implement its decisions.

Vice Chairman Hab Comin said, "The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee was convened at a critical moment when our party and country faced life and death. It was held after we achieved a decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot. It is a significant meeting in the history of our party. It will not only play a crucial role in stabilizing the national situation but also ensure the continuity of the line, principles, and policies adopted since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. I firmly support all the decisions made by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, firmly support the central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, fully agree with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's three speeches, and fully agree with Comrade Li Peng's report to the Fourth Plenary Session on behalf of the Political Bureau regarding Comrade Zhao Ziyang's errors during the anti-party and anti-socialist turmoil."

Hab Comin said, "In the future, we must earnestly adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, seriously oppose bourgeois liberalization, and integrate them into all our work. We must persist in this for a long time. While focusing on the construction of socialist material civilization, we must also focus on the construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Reform and opening up must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles because our goal is to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, strengthen the party's leadership, consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, strengthen the guidance of Marxist theory in practice, and frustrate the international capitalist strategy of 'peaceful evolution' and 'victory without war.' Otherwise, we will go astray, which is absolutely unacceptable to the party and the people. The four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session are practical and in line with the people's wishes. We should summarize the experience of the People's Congress, study how to improve the People's Congress system under the party's leadership and in accordance with the Constitution. This is an important issue in the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law. We should make achievements and live up to the people's trust and expectations."

Vice Chairman Saifuding Aizizi said, "The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of our country. Without the Four Cardinal Principles, bourgeois liberalization will inevitably spread. Without emphasizing ideological and political work, the Four Cardinal Principles will be weakened, and the ideological battlefield will be ceded to bourgeois liberalization. Currently, the awareness of class struggle has weakened. Those who truly uphold Marxism are labeled as conservative, ultra-left, and rigid, while those who vigorously promote bourgeois liberalization, such as Fang Lizhi, are praised as heroes and elites leading the new trend. This has led to chaos in the theoretical, literary, and ideological fronts. Some people, under the guise of theoretical research, propose changing the formulation of the Four Cardinal Principles. For many years, the trend of non-theory, non-society, and non-morality has been rampant in the literary circles. Books are published without considering the social benefits of the proletariat. Street bookstalls have become platforms for promoting bourgeois liberalization. Low-level and vulgar books and magazines are flooding the stalls, seriously poisoning our youth. Books and films that denigrate, defame, and insult minorities are also appearing, seriously hurting national feelings, weakening national unity, and bringing serious consequences to the party's cause."

He said, "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all ethnic groups within the country are the basic guarantees for our cause to be victorious. Forty years of practice has proven that Chairman Mao's words are an unshakable truth. We must constantly maintain the good situation of stability and unity and always safeguard the unity of the motherland. We must fully understand and seriously implement the party's policies on ethnic minorities and religion. We must further develop a new type of socialist ethnic relations based on equality, unity, and mutual assistance, and jointly counter the plots and sabotage of all enemies at home and abroad."

He said, "Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are the basic guarantees for us to move from victory to new victories. Only socialism can save China. Those who oppose the Communist Party of China, who oppose Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and who oppose socialism, we will fight them to the end."

Commissioner Li Gui pointed out that the great significance of the Fourth Plenary Session is the removal of Zhao Ziyang from all his party positions and the formation of the central leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary. This ensures that our party can stand firm in adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and in carrying out reform and opening up to build socialism. The Fourth Plenary Session communiqué proposed four tasks to be solved, and Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that solving the issues that the masses are most concerned about, especially the issue of corruption within the party, is a crucial issue that relates to the prestige and life and death of the party. We must resolutely implement it. The Fourth Plenary Session emphasized that the line, principles, and policies decided by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee remain unchanged, and the policy of reform and opening up remains unchanged. This is the most popular policy. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the country, and reform and opening up are the path to strength. We must persist to the end.

Commissioner Yao Guang pointed out that promoting bourgeois liberalization in our country and opposing the Four Cardinal Principles is a violation of the Constitution and is not allowed by socialist legal system. As early as the 1954 Constitution, these Four Cardinal Principles had been affirmed. As the General Secretary of the Party, Comrade Zhao Ziyang did not lead by example in observing the Constitution and the Party Charter; he seriously betrayed the Four Cardinal Principles and incited and promoted the spread of bourgeois liberalization. Therefore, during the period when he was in charge of the central work, bourgeois liberalization was not only not stopped but became more rampant, eventually leading to this shocking counter-revolutionary riot, causing huge losses to the party and the state. Once the line, principles, and policies of our party are elevated to laws, all organizations and individuals, including party and state leaders, must consciously and strictly observe them; any behavior that violates the law must be punished according to the law.

Commissioner Yang Jike, in his speech, proposed his own suggestions on the development strategy and planning research for the most important economic zone in our country—the "Suzhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shanghai" economic zone, focusing on transportation, energy, and raw material industry construction.

Commissioner Li Guiying said, "In recent years, ideological and political work has indeed been relaxed and weakened, especially the issue of what kind of young generation to cultivate. If the proletariat does not occupy this position, the bourgeoisie will. This issue should be highly valued. The profound lessons of this political struggle prove that at any time, focusing only on the economy and not on politics is not acceptable."

Commissioner Tao Aiying said, "The reform and opening up we are adhering to is a reform and opening up in the socialist direction, not the capitalist reform and opening up advocated by some people. We should seriously summarize the experience of reform and opening up since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and deepen the reform and opening up."

Commissioner Yang Lifeng said, "Comrade Zhao Ziyang has long advocated and promoted many wrong viewpoints in his actual work, such as the 'inevitability of corruption.' Due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's advocacy of this viewpoint, it first numbed the minds of the entire party, disarmed the fight against corruption and the resistance to corruption, relaxed party discipline, administrative discipline, and legal discipline, and relaxed public security management. Therefore, corruption has become more rampant, seriously damaging social ethics, corrupting the body of the party and the government, causing dissatisfaction among the people towards the party and the government, and causing serious harm in politics and economics. He suggested a thorough criticism of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's 'inevitability of corruption' and the elimination of its influence. We must earnestly follow Comrade Xiaoping's instructions, truly fight against corruption, achieve results, and win the trust of the people."

Commissioner He Ying pointed out that combating corruption is an urgent task. Although corrupt elements are only a small number, their harm is great, and they are unpopular. To regain and enhance the prestige of the party and the government among the people, we must make a firm decision, remove obstacles, start from within the party, from the leadership, and from major cases to achieve breakthrough progress. In severely punishing corruption and promoting clean governance, the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee must strengthen legal and work supervision, arrange for the State Council to report to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on the situation of rectifying companies and punishing corruption in a timely manner, and play our supervisory role.

Commissioner Li Jianbai said, "This turmoil is a serious destruction of socialist legal system. A few people with ulterior motives, on the one hand, shouted the slogan of solving problems through democratic and legal means, but on the other hand, they acted without restraint, destroying the legal system, lawless, violating the Constitution and laws, becoming 'special citizens' who are not bound by any law, can do whatever they want, violate laws and regulations, destroy social order and state property, and interfere with the actions and freedom of others at will. This is not only a destruction of the legal system but also a trampling of democracy. The legal system is the guarantee of democracy. If even normal social order is not maintained, where can democracy be found? Democracy without the legal system can only be anarchism and will ultimately lead to the opposite of democracy. For the long-term stability and prosperity of the country, we must strengthen the construction of the legal system."

    认真贯彻落实四中全会精神  人大常委踊跃发表意见建议
    新华社北京七月四日电  七届全国人大常委会第八次会议今天下午举行大会发言，畅谈学习党的十三届四中全会精神的体会，并就如何贯彻落实全会精神发表意见和建议。
    习仲勋副委员长说，党的十三届四中全会是在我们党和国家面临生死存亡的关键时刻召开的，是在我们取得了粉碎反革命暴乱决定性胜利的形势下召开的，是我们党的历史发展上的一次重要的会议。它不仅对于当前进一步稳定全国局势具有重大作用，而且对于保证十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策的连续性，必将产生深远的影响。我坚决拥护党的十三届四中全会作出的各项决定，坚决拥护以江泽民同志为核心的中央领导集体，完全同意邓小平同志的三次讲话，完全同意李鹏同志代表中央政治局向四中全会提出的关于赵紫阳同志在反党反社会主义动乱中所犯错误的报告。
    习仲勋说，今后我们要扎扎实实地坚持四项基本原则，认认真真地反对资产阶级自由化，贯穿到各项工作中去，长期坚持不懈。在抓紧社会主义物质文明建设的同时，要抓紧社会主义精神文明建设。改革开放必须坚持四项基本原则，因为我们的目的是建设有中国特色的社会主义，加强党的领导，巩固人民民主专政，加强马克思主义理论对实践的指导，粉碎国际资本主义的“和平演变”、“不战而胜”的战略妄想。否则，就会走到邪路上去，这是党和人民绝对不能允许的。四中全会提出的当前要特别注意抓好的四件大事是切合实际，顺乎民心的。我们应当认真总结人大工作的经验，好好研究一下如何在党的领导下，按照宪法规定的职权，进一步完善人民代表大会制度，这是社会主义民主和法制建设的一个重要课题，我们应当有所建树，有所作为，决不辜负人民的重托和期望。
    赛福鼎·艾则孜副委员长说，四项基本原则是我国的立国之本。不讲四项基本原则，资产阶级自由化思潮就必然泛滥；不重视思想政治工作，必然要削弱四项基本原则，为资产阶级自由化腾让思想阵地。现在的情况是，阶级斗争的观念淡薄了。真正坚持马克思主义的同志被斥之为保守、极左、僵化，一些起劲鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，如方励之之流却被吹捧为领导新潮流的“英雄”、“精英”，以至于在理论战线，文艺战线，思想战线，出现了混乱局面。有人以研究理论为名，提出四项基本原则内容的提法应改变。多年来在文艺界非理论，非社会，非道德的思潮泛滥成灾，出书不讲无产阶级的社会效益。街上的书摊成了宣扬资产阶级自由化的阵地。一些低级、庸俗的书报充斥书摊，严重地毒害着我们的青少年。还不断出现了贬低、丑化，污辱少数民族的书籍、影片，严重地伤害了民族感情，削弱了民族团结，给党的事业带来严重后果。
    他说，“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”四十年来的实践证明，毛主席的这句话是一条颠扑不破的真理。我们要不断地维护安定团结的大好形势，要时刻维护祖国的统一。全面理解、认真贯彻执行党的民族政策和宗教政策。进一步发展平等、团结、互助的新型的社会主义民族关系，共同对付国内外一切敌人的阴谋破坏。
    他说，马列主义、毛泽东思想是指导我们从胜利走向新的胜利的基本保证。只有社会主义才能救中国。谁反对中国共产党，谁反对马列主义、毛泽东思想，谁反对社会主义，我们将同他斗争到底。
    李贵委员指出，四中全会伟大意义是撤销了赵紫阳的党内一切职务，产生了以江泽民同志为总书记的党中央的领导集体，这就保证了我们党在坚持四项基本原则基础上坚持改革开放、建设社会主义能够立于不败之地。四中全会公报中提出要解决的四件事，小平同志指出要解决群众最关心的事，特别是消除党内的腐败问题是至关重要的问题，也是关系到党的威信和生死存亡的事。我们必须坚决地贯彻执行。四中全会强调了十一届三中全会决定的路线、方针、政策不变，改革开放的政策不变这是最得人心的。四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，我们一定要坚持到底。
    姚广委员指出，在我国搞资产阶级自由化，反对四项基本原则，是违犯宪法的，是我国社会主义法制所不允许的。早在一九五四年宪法中，这四项基本原则，实际上已得到确认。身为党的总书记的赵紫阳同志，既不带头遵守宪法、按宪法办事，也不遵守党章；他严重背弃四项基本原则，怂恿并助长资产阶级自由化的泛滥，因而，在他主持中央工作这段时期，资产阶级自由化不仅未得到制止，反而愈演愈烈，以致酿成这场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱，给党和国家造成了巨大损失。我们党的路线、方针、政策一旦上升为法律，任何组织和个人、包括党和国家领导人在内，都必须自觉地严格遵守；任何违反法律的行为，都必须绳之以法，依法惩处。
    杨纪珂委员在发言中就我国最重要的经济区——“苏浙皖赣沪”上海经济区的交通、能源、原材料工业建设的发展战略和规划研究提出了自己的建议。
    李桂英委员说，近几年来，的确是放松和削弱了思想政治工作，特别是培养什么样的年轻一代的问题，无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就要去占领，这个问题应当引起我们高度的重视。这场政治斗争的深刻教训证明，任何时候只抓经济不抓政治是不行的。
    陶爱英委员说，我们所坚持的改革开放，是坚持社会主义方向的改革开放，绝不是某些人搞的资本主义化的改革开放。我们要认真总结十一届三中全会以来进行改革开放的经验，更好地深化改革，深化开放。
    杨立功委员说，赵紫阳同志长期以来在实际工作中提倡鼓吹了许多错误论点，如“腐败难免论”。由于赵紫阳同志鼓吹这个观点，首先麻痹了全党的思想，解除了反腐败拒腐蚀的武装，松弛了党纪、政纪、法纪，松弛了治安管理，因此腐败现象越演越烈，严重地败坏了社会风气，腐蚀了党和政府的肌体，引起了群众对党和政府的不满，在政治上、经济上都造成了严重的危害。他建议彻底批判赵紫阳同志的“腐败难免论”，肃清影响。要扎扎实实按小平同志说的办，真正反对腐败，作出成效，取信于民。
    何英委员指出，惩治腐败是当务之急。腐败分子虽只占极少数，但危害很大，民愤很大，不得人心。为了取信于民，恢复和提高党和政府在人民中的声望，要狠下决心，排除阻力，从党内，从领导层，从大案抓起，取得突破性进展。在严惩腐败，促进廉政建设等方面，我们人大及其常委会务必加强法律和工作监督，适时安排国务院向人大常委会在整顿公司、惩治腐败情况的汇报，起到我们的监督作用。
    李剑白委员说，这次动乱是对社会主义法制的严重破坏，极少数别有用心的人一方面喊出用民主和法制的办法解决问题的口号，另一方面他们在行动上却肆无忌惮地破坏法制，无法无天，违背宪法和法律，成了不受任何法律约束的“特殊公民”，可以为所欲为，违法乱纪破坏社会秩序和国家财产，随意干涉他人的行动和自由，这既是对法制的破坏，也是对民主的践踏。法制是民主的保障，如果连正常的社会秩序都没有，哪里会有民主可言。没有法制的民主只能是无政府主义，最终一定会走到民主的反面。为了国家的长治久安，我们必须加强法制建设。
