	One turn, two turns, three turns...
	I am drenched in sweat, my head is spinning, I am exhausted.
	It seems like it will never end.
	I stand on my tiptoes and stretch my head to see how much wheat is left in the hopper on the other side of the millstone. It's not yet dawn, and I am short, so I can't see clearly. I anxiously ask, "Mom, how much is left?"
	Mother angrily replies, "Boy, I wish we could grind day and night, always have something to grind. Why are you in such a hurry?"
	I want to use going to the bathroom as an excuse to escape. Mom says, "You want to 'run away to pee' again? Grind!"
	Dawn breaks. In almost despair, the stone mill finally stops. I jump out like a prisoner who has been pardoned, running towards the blue sky, the small river, the magpie's nest, the bees, frogs, and my picture books!
	But the next morning, in a drowsy state, I hear my mother calling us to grind wheat again.
	I am like a young calf, too early to be yoked to the plow. I hate that thing made of two round stones! It has crushed so many of my interesting plans, ground away my golden childhood! I wish I could never do this boring and miserable job again!
	My wish soon comes true— the production brigade sets up a communal canteen. Steaming rice, thick rice porridge, everything is ready, just grab a bowl and fill your stomach. Our family's stone mill is left idle in the corner of the house, and I laugh at it happily.
	However, the communal canteen has no magic treasure, and the good days don't last long. Steamed rice disappears, and even the thin porridge is only two small spoonfuls per person per meal. Every time Mother brings back the porridge from the canteen, she adds a lot of vegetables, radish sprouts, or taro and endless water, boiling it into a pot that smells strongly of pig feed, to be distributed according to our needs. This "drink" may contain a lot of "chlorophyll," but unfortunately, it stays in the stomach for too short a time, and by evening, often "the quilt is not yet warm, and the chamber pot is full." After a few months of this, everyone's face is full of "chlorophyll."
	It is only at this time, only at this time, that I understand the depth of meaning in Mother's words, "I wish we could grind day and night without stopping!"
	It is only at this time, only at this time, that I feel how lovable the stone mill in our house is! But it lies quietly in the corner, as if smiling at me for not knowing "the bitterness of life" when I was young!
	Finally, there is a glimmer of hope: my brother and I sneak past the brigade leader's eyes and pick up some wheat ears from the harvested fields. The whole family is overjoyed, and we stay up all night to thresh the wheat by hand and set up the stone mill to grind quickly. This time, I forget to count the turns, feeling only that it is not enough. The dim yellow light of the small oil lamp shines on Mother's face, with beads of water, bright and shiny, are they tears or sweat? Joy or sorrow? I can't tell.
	The next morning, we eat a bowl of dumplings without "chlorophyll," feeling that we have never eaten such good food in our lives.
	So, we go to steal wheat again, and at night, we grind like crazy. That thing made of stones from who knows which dynasty, accompanies me through my teenage years—a rare period of great famine.
	Later, I go out to study and gradually shed my "rural" ways, also gradually forgetting the love and hate I had for that stone mill. The last time I returned to my hometown with my wife and children, my eighty-year-old mother talked about how I used to grind and how I would "run away to pee" to avoid work, how I would count the turns, and so on, and the whole family laughed until they fell over. The son who grew up in the city didn't know what a stone mill was or what grinding was, so he asked, "Do you still grind now?"
	Mother smiled and said, "Now who needs to grind? Rice or flour, the village's grain processing factory uses machines to do it all, no need to worry about it!"
	The old lady paused and then said sadly, "Now farming relies entirely on chemical fertilizer. If we keep going like this, one day we will want to grind but won't have anything to grind— I am afraid of hunger!"
	I can't help but feel a pang in my heart, and then ask about the whereabouts of the stone mill at home. The family doesn't know where it went.

    系在石磨上的憎爱
    张晏斌
    一……转、二……转、三……转……
    我大汗淋漓，我头昏脑胀，我精疲力竭。
    好象永远没有完。
    我踮起脚尖来，伸头看磨盘那边的芭斗里还剩多少麦子，天还没有大亮，我个子又矮，看不大清楚，便焦急地问：“妈，还有多少？”
    母亲愠怒地说：“相公，我巴不得一天到晚磨不停，天天有磨的，你急什么？”
    我想借口撒尿趁机逃跑。妈说：“又要‘借尿遁’啊？磨！”
    天大亮了。在几乎绝望中，石磨终于停了。我像死囚遇上了大赦，蹦跳着奔了出去。啊，我的蓝天，我的小河，我的喜鹊窝，我的蜜蜂、青蛙和小人书们！
    可是第二天清晨，在睡意朦胧中，我又听到母亲来喊我们磨麦子。
    我像一头稚嫩的牛犊，过早地被套上了犁耙。我恨透了那两片圆形石头造成的家伙，心里头以最恶意的语言诅咒它！它磨碎了我多少有趣的计划，磨去了我的金色童年！我巴不得永远不再干这枯躁无味的倒霉的营生！
    我的愿望不久竟真的实现了——生产队里办起了公共食堂，香喷喷的大米饭、稠得吸不动的大米粥，一切都是现成的，到时候拿碗尽肚子装。我家的石磨被闲置在屋角里，我冲着它开心地笑了。
    然而，公共食堂里没有聚宝盆，好日子没过几天，大米饭就不见了，连“鼻风吹起两道沟”的薄粥，也只是每人每顿两小勺。母亲每次把粥从食堂里打回来，总要加上许多青菜或萝卜英子或苕子和取之不尽的水，熬成散发着浓郁猪食味的一大锅，供我们“按需分配”。这种“饮料”虽然含有相当丰富的“叶绿素”，无奈在胃肠里停留的时间太短，到了晚上往往是“被子还没焐得暖，尿壶就要满”。几个月灌下来，人人满脸都是“叶绿素”。
    这时候，只有在这时候，我才体会到母亲所说的“巴不得一天到晚磨不停”这句话里，含有多深的意蕴！
    这时候，只有在这时候，我才觉得家中的石磨多么可爱！但它静静地躺在屋角，似在无言地笑我“少时不识愁滋味”！
    终于有一点转机了：我和弟弟躲过生产队长的眼睛，在收割后的大田里拾回一些麦穗，一家人欢天喜地，连夜用手脱麦，连夜架起石磨风快地磨起来。这回我忘记了计算转数，只是觉得不过瘾，小油灯昏黄的灯光，照见母亲脸上的水珠点点，亮晶晶的，是泪还是汗？是喜还是悲？我说不清楚。
    第二天早上，我们吃了一顿不含“叶绿素”的面疙瘩，觉得平生第一次吃这么好的东西。
    于是再去做贼似地拾麦，夜里再发疯似地磨麦。那个不知哪朝哪代传下来的石头家伙，居然就这样伴我度过了少年时代——一个罕见的大饥馑时期。
    后来我外出上学，逐渐地脱了“土气”，也逐渐地把对那盘石磨的爱和恨都给淡忘了，上次挈妇携子回故乡，八十高龄的老母亲说起我小时候磨磨怎样“借尿遁”躲懒、怎样不停地计算转数等等丑态，一家人笑的前仰后合，城里长大的儿子竟不知石磨为何物、磨磨为何事，因问“现在还磨不？”
    母亲笑道：“如今哪里还用得着磨磨哟！米也好，面也罢，村里的粮食加工厂都用机器弄的好好的，用不着操这份心了！”
    老人家顿一顿，又忧郁地说：“如今种田，全靠化肥当家，照这样弄下去，总有一天想磨没的磨——我是饿怕了！”
    我不由的心里一沉，旋即询问家里那盘石磨何在，一家人竟不知它的去向。
