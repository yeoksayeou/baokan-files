Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, July 23rd - (Reporter Chen Yunzhen) Some party and government leaders in Zhenning Buyi and Miao Autonomous County have used deceptive methods to illegally occupy prime farmland to build private houses, sparking public outrage. The disciplinary and supervisory departments of Guizhou Province are urgently investigating and handling the cases to rectify the party's style of work.

Zhenning County is the famous scenic area of Huangguoshu Waterfall. Since March last year, the county's Party Secretary Lu Shengfu, Deputy County Magistrate Liang Daorong, Deputy Director of the County Party Committee Office Zhou Zushu and Xi Benkang, Deputy Director of the County Education Bureau Lin Yuan, and the well-known local contractor Wang Longhu, have taken advantage of the state's expansion of the Guiyang to Huangguoshu scenic area expressway and the county's planned construction of the Guihuang Road street, to be the first to occupy land and build houses. They used the tactic of "acting first and reporting later," selecting ideal housing sites in Beiguan Village near the expansion project, and reaching land use agreements with local farmers beforehand. They then used various excuses and the names of their children or siblings to submit land use applications to the land management department. Party Secretary Lu Shengfu's entire family of four lives in a six-room house with a kitchen and courtyards front and back, but in the application, he claimed "housing is crowded." The Deputy Director of the County Education Bureau, Lin Yuan, has a family of five living in a three-room house with a kitchen, but falsely claimed to have "13 people living together." Deputy Director of the County Party Committee Office, Zhou Zushu, sold his inherited five-and-a-half-room property in 1985, but now his family of ten lives in a four-room government-hostel with a kitchen, using the name of his son, who has already moved his household registration to another province, to obtain a piece of land for building a house.

The building sites of Lu Shengfu, Liang Daorong, Zhou Zushu, and contractor Wang Longhu are all adjacent to the planned Guihuang Road street. Their applied land use is 1.1 mu, but the actual occupied area exceeds 1.5 mu.

    镇宁县部分领导干部非法占用好地建私房
    贵州省纪检、监察部门正在抓紧查处
    据新华社贵阳7月23日电　（记者陈云珍）贵州镇宁布依族苗族自治县部分党政领导干部采用欺骗手段，非法占用良田好地建私房，激起公愤。贵州省纪检、监察部门正抓紧查处，以正党风。
    镇宁县是著名风景区黄果树瀑布所在地。去年3月以来，这个县的县委书记卢盛福，副县长梁道荣，县委办公室副主任周祖述、席本康，县教育局副局长林远以及当地有名的包工头王龙虎，利用国家扩建贵阳至黄果树风景区旅游高速公路和县里规划建贵黄公路一条街的机会，率先占地建房。他们采取先斩后奏的手段，到靠近扩建工程的北关村选定了理想的建房地点，并事先和农户达成了用地协议，然后才以种种借口和用子女、兄弟的名义向土地管理部门提出用地申请。县委书记卢盛福全家4口，住6室1厨、前后有院的房子，在申请中却借口“住房拥挤”。县教育局副局长林远全家5口，已有3室1厨住房，竟谎称“有13人同住”。县委办副主任周祖述曾在1985年把继承的5间半房产转卖他人，现全家10口住县政府4室1厨的宿舍，也用户口早已迁往省外的儿子名义，要到了一份建房用地。
    卢盛福、梁道荣、周祖述及包工头王龙虎的建房地点，紧靠规划的贵黄公路一条街，他们的申请用地为1.1亩，而实际占地面积又超过1.5亩。
