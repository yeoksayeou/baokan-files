A nationwide conference on the theory of rural grassroots political construction, which concluded today, provided a survey indicating that while the overall situation of village-level organizations is good, approximately 20% are in a state of disarray.

Most of the village-level organizations in disarray are concentrated in impoverished areas, particularly where collective economies are weak. The main reasons for this disarray include: weak collective economies, which undermine the cohesion of village-level organizations; incomplete rural policies and imperfect laws, which increase the difficulties faced by village cadres; and the relatively low quality of some village cadres, whose work styles and methods are not suited to the new situation after reforms.

According to a sample analysis of 137 villages, many village cadres often find themselves in a dilemma of "old methods no longer work, new methods not yet mastered," and thus need to continuously improve their qualifications.

Minister of Civil Affairs, Cui Naifu, said at the meeting that in the coming period, the construction of rural township governments should focus on streamlining administration, increasing transparency, rationalizing relationships, and appropriately setting up institutions. Village committees should center on implementing the Organic Law of Village Committees to change the situation where grassroots organizations are paralyzed or semi-paralyzed.

    我国农村基层组织20％处于涣散状态
    新华社北京7月12日电  今天结束的全国农村基层政权建设理论研讨会提供的一份调查材料表明：目前全国村级组织建设的主流是好的，但仍有20％左右处于涣散状态。
    处于涣散状态的村级组织大部分集中在贫困地区，特别是集体经济薄弱的地方。造成涣散的主要原因是：集体经济薄弱，削弱了村级组织的凝聚力；农村政策不配套、法律不完善，增加了村干部的工作难度；部分村干部素质较差，工作作风和工作方法不适应改革后的新形势。
    据对137个村抽样分析，不少村干部往往陷于“老法不行，新法不会”的困境，需要不断提高素质。
    民政部部长崔乃夫今天在会上说，今后一个时期，农村乡镇政权建设要以简政放权、增加办事透明度、理顺关系，合理设置机构为重点；村委会要以贯彻村民委员会组织法为中心，改变基层组织瘫痪、半瘫痪状态。
