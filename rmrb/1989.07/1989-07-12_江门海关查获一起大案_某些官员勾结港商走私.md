Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 12th.

Jiangmen Customs has recently uncovered a major smuggling case. Several key officials from the Party Committee of Douhu Town in Taishan County, Guangdong Province, colluded with Hong Kong merchants to smuggle 2,500 cases of foreign cigarettes, valued at 5.24 million yuan, and illegally profited 1.4 million yuan.

In early January, Hong Kong merchant Ma Xixian proposed to the Deputy Secretary of the Douhu Town Party Committee, Guan Weizhe and Li Yuping, to jointly smuggle foreign cigarettes. The Town Party Committee Secretary, Guo Yingxiao, fully supported this.

In mid-March, the smuggling activities began. Within just two weeks, this group carried out four smuggling operations, bringing in 2,000 cases of foreign cigarettes. The sale of these smuggled goods yielded 3.37 million Hong Kong dollars and 840,000 yuan. Of this, 1.27 million Hong Kong dollars were smuggled out of the country in two separate instances. On the evening of April 16, 500 cases of foreign cigarettes being smuggled into the country were intercepted by Jiangmen Customs during unloading. Currently, the five individuals involved in the above smuggling crimes have been handed over to the public security authorities.
