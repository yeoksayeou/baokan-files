Indian opposition party members of the lower house submitted their resignations one by one to the speaker yesterday, protesting the government's corrupt behavior and demanding that Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi resign.

The mass resignation of Indian opposition party members in the parliament is unprecedented since India's independence. The trigger for this event was a report submitted by an auditor general on July 18. The report revealed loopholes in a 1986 transaction where the Indian government spent $1.3 billion to purchase cannons from a Swedish arms company. This transaction was approved by the finance minister, Singh, of the Rajiv Gandhi cabinet.

Leaders of the opposition parties also demanded the immediate dissolution of the lower house and the holding of early elections. Observers here believe that the lower house has 544 seats, with the opposition holding only 104. Therefore, the resignation of opposition party members will not affect the normal operation of the lower house. The government will proceed with its plans to pass bills related to local autonomy and employment programs in the lower house as originally scheduled.

    抗议政府腐败行为
    印反对党议员辞职
    新华社新德里7月25日电  印度下议院12个反对党的所有104名议员昨天逐个向议长提交了辞职书，以抗议政府的腐败行为，并要求拉吉夫·甘地总理引咎辞职。
    印度反对党议员采取全体辞职行动，在印度独立后议会史上是第一次，它的起因是18日一位审计长提交的一份报告。该报告指出，印度政府1986年用13亿美元向一家瑞典军火公司购买大炮的交易中有漏洞，而这笔交易当时是由拉·甘地内阁的财政部长辛格批准的。
    反对党领导人还要求立即解散下议院，并提前举行大选。此间观察家认为，印度下议院共有544个席位，反对党只占104个席位。因此反对党议员的辞职将不会影响下议院的正常的运转。政府将按原计划使其有关地方自治和就业计划的法案在下议院获得通过。
