    This year, in the first half of the year, China implemented a series of effective measures, resulting in a 5.11% increase in gold production compared to the same period last year, setting a new historical high for the same period.

    Over the past decade, the state has paid great attention to the development of gold production, implementing a series of preferential policies that have led to a year-on-year increase in gold production. However, due to the rampant individual gold mining, poor management, and severe damage to the country's precious gold resources, the production of state-owned key gold mines has been disrupted, hindering the significant growth of gold production.

    To address these issues, the State Council approved the establishment of the State Gold Administration Bureau in May last year, strengthening industry leadership, and issued Document No. 75 (1988), explicitly banning individual gold mining. To motivate county governments to focus on gold production, the state has also stipulated that for every tael of gold produced and sold to the state, the state will provide a subsidy of 70 yuan in addition to the price.

    上半年黄金产量创纪录
    本报讯　今年上半年，我国采取了一系列有效措施，使黄金产量比去年同期增长百分之五点一一，创历史同期的最高水平。
    近十年来，国家对发展黄金生产很重视，制定了一系列优惠政策，使黄金产量逐年提高。但是由于个体采金泛滥，管理不力，严重地破坏了国家宝贵的黄金资源，干扰了国营骨干黄金矿山的生产，阻碍了黄金生产的大幅度增长。
    针对这些问题，国务院于去年五月批准成立国家黄金管理局，强化了行业领导，并且发布了（一九八八）七十五号文件，明令取缔个体采金。为了调动县政府抓黄金生产积极性，国家还规定，县里每产出、交售给国家一两黄金，国家给予七十元价外补贴的倾斜政策。
