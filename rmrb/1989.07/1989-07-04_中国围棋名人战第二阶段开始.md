The second stage of the second Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament (Qiong Lian Cup) began today at the Taihua Hotel in Haikou.

Interestingly, all four matches ended with the black player, who had the first move, winning in the middle game.

Although Master Nie finished his match the earliest, he faced strong resistance from Yang Jinhua, a 6th dan player, and did not win easily. The most thrilling match of the day was between Wang Qun, an 8th dan player, and Cheng Xiaoliu, a 6th dan player. Both players had large dragons on the board, and it was a battle to the death. In the end, Cheng Xiaoliu, who had insufficient material for the ko, saw his dragon captured by Wang Qun.

Yu Bin, a 9th dan player, and Qian Yuping, a 9th dan player, both won their matches against Ma Xiaochun, a 9th dan player, and Yang Hui, a 7th dan player, respectively, while holding a significant advantage.

This afternoon, hundreds of chess enthusiasts in Haikou listened to Huayi Jiang, an 8th dan player, and Wang Runnan, an 8th dan player, give an entertaining and insightful lecture on the game.

This is the first time the Chinese Weiqi team has come to Hainan Province for a competition. Their arrival has sparked a wave of interest in Weiqi in Hainan.

The second stage of the Chinese Weiqi Masters Tournament in Hainan Province will continue for four more rounds. The player with the highest points will earn the right to challenge the reigning master, Liu Xiaoguang, a 9th dan player.

Today, a responsible comrade from the Hainan Provincial Committee met with the participating players and representatives from the People's Daily (Overseas Edition).

    中国围棋名人战第二阶段开始
    本报海口7月4日电　记者陈昭报道：第二届中国围棋名人战（琼联杯）第二阶段的比赛今日在海口泰华酒店落子。
    有趣的是，4盘棋的结果都是执黑先行的棋手中盘获胜。
    聂棋圣虽然最早结束战斗，但面对杨晋华六段的顽强抵抗，胜得不太轻松，王群八段与程晓流六段的厮杀可谓今日4盘对局中最惊心动魄的了。双方两条大龙均处于不是你死便是我亡的境地。在打劫中，程晓流由于劫材不够，终被对方将大龙吃掉。
    俞斌九段和钱宇平九段均在占有较大优势的情形下分别战胜马晓春九段和杨晖七段。
    今天下午，海口市数百名棋迷听了华以刚八段和王汝南八段妙趣横生的大盘讲解。
    中国围棋队是第一次到海南省进行比赛，他们的到来，在海南掀起了一股围棋热。
    中国围棋名人战第二阶段的比赛在海南省还要进行四轮赛事，积分最高者将取得向上届名人刘小光九段的挑战权。
    今天，海南省省委负责同志会见了参赛棋手和主办单位人民日报（海外版）的同志。
