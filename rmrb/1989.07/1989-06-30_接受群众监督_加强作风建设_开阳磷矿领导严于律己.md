The leading Party members of the Guizhou Province Guyang Phosphorus Mine Bureau have voluntarily accepted public supervision, earnestly eliminated corruption, and set an example for creating a good image of Communist Party members among the people.

Guyang Phosphorus Mine is one of China's three major phosphorus mines, with nearly 10,000 employees and over 1,400 Party members. In the past two years, the Bureau Party Committee has taken the construction of the work style of Party member leaders seriously, combining it with the actual situation of the mine. They started by addressing issues that the public is most sensitive to and generally concerned about, setting strict requirements for Party member leaders. The Bureau's staff congress discussed and agreed that the living standards of the Bureau's leaders could be better than those of the workers, but they have consistently adhered to the principle that the living standards of leaders should be the same as those of the workers.

The leaders at various levels of this Bureau also pay special attention to voluntarily accepting supervision from the workers. The Party Committee clearly stipulates that if the relatives or children of deputy-section-level and above cadres are to be transferred to work in the Bureau or promoted to deputy-section-level and above positions, it must be approved by the collective discussion of the Bureau Party Committee.

Because the Party member leaders have set an example, the prestige of Party members among the people has gradually increased, and the Party's cohesion and appeal have significantly strengthened. Currently, more than 500 workers in the entire Bureau have applied to join the Party organization.

    本报贵阳6月30日电　记者潘帝都报道：贵州省开阳磷矿矿务局党员领导干部自觉接受群众监督，认真清除腐败现象，为在群众中树立共产党员的良好形象做出表率。
    开阳磷矿是我国的三大磷矿之一，有职工近万名，党员1400多名。近两年来，矿务局党委切实把党员领导干部的思想作风建设，放在重要位置上抓紧抓好，他们结合本矿实际，首先从群众最敏感和普遍关心的问题入手，对党员领导干部提出了严格要求。矿务局职代会讨论同意，矿务局领导住房可比职工宽，但他们一直坚持住房标准与职工群众一样。
    这个矿务局的各级领导干部还特别注意自觉接受职工群众的监督。局党委明确规定，副处级以上干部的亲属子女，要调进局机关工作，或提拔为副科级以上职务，必须经局党委集体讨论同意。
    由于党员领导干部做出了表率，党员在群众中的威信逐渐提高，党的凝聚力、感召力明显增强，全局现已有500多名职工向党组织提出了入党申请。
