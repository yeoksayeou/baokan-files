Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 18th.

The State Council held a telephone conference in Beijing this evening to commend units that achieved high yields in summer grain and oil production in 1989. Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, on behalf of the State Council, extended congratulations and thanks to the units that met the standards, and urged all regions to strengthen leadership, continue their efforts, and do everything possible to achieve a bumper harvest in the autumn agricultural season.

The commendation meeting was presided over by State Councilor Chen Junsheng. Minister of Agriculture He Kang read out the list of units that met the standards (the full list will be published in the fifth edition of this newspaper tomorrow). There are 16 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, 62 prefecture-level cities, and 358 county-level units that met the standards. These units, in the nationwide summer grain and oil high-yield campaign this year, achieved either grain or oil yield per unit area, or total grain and oil yield, or both, making outstanding contributions to the summer grain and oil harvest.

Tian Jiyun said at the commendation meeting that the summer grain and oil production has achieved the first victory, which is of great significance. It not only helps to ease the current supply-demand contradiction in the market, stabilize prices, stabilize the situation, and calm people's minds, but also lays a good foundation in thought and material for achieving an overall bumper harvest in agriculture this year and for completely defeating the counter-revolutionary riots. The facts once again prove that China's 800 million farmers and the vast number of cadres love the Communist Party and support the socialist system, and that the rural socialist front is solid.

Tian Jiyun put forward six requirements for achieving an overall bumper harvest in agriculture this year:

1. Fully recognize the arduousness of achieving a bumper harvest in the autumn agricultural season. We must not be blindly optimistic or relax our efforts due to the summer grain and oil harvest. We must persist and tighten each link to strive for an overall bumper harvest throughout the year.

2. Effectively carry out the summer grain and oil procurement work. The grain departments must strictly implement the relevant national procurement policies and ensure timely fulfillment of the contracted materials and related policies. All levels of government should actively organize banks, finance, commerce, and other departments to raise funds through multiple channels to prevent procurement from issuing "blank checks," but procurement should not be passive due to tight funds. After completing the summer grain and oil contract procurement tasks at the county level, all regions should immediately open the grain and oil market, implement multi-channel operations, prevent regional blockades and checkpoints, prevent price hikes, and prevent multiple purchases.

3. Do everything possible to expand the area of replanting. All regions must make use of every opportunity and adapt to local conditions to improve the replanting index and strive to plant more.

4. Seriously promote advanced agricultural technologies. To complete this year's production increase plan, while ensuring the sowing area, we must seriously implement the "harvest plan" and promote the popularization of various production increase and income increase measures to strive to increase the yield per unit area.

5. Actively increase the production of agricultural production materials, improve specialized operations, and ensure supply.

6. Seriously do a good job in various disaster prevention and mitigation work. The current flood season has arrived, and relevant regions must do a good job in flood control and disaster relief. It is necessary to ensure that major rivers such as the Yangtze, Yellow, and Huai Rivers do not have major problems. The governments at all levels in other places must not be complacent and must seriously organize relevant departments to strengthen the forecasting and monitoring of various disasters, actively prepare for disaster prevention, and implement disaster prevention and mitigation measures.

    国务院召开电话会议
    表彰夏季粮油创高产达标单位
    田纪云提出六项要求勉励各地再夺秋季农业丰收
    本报北京7月18日讯　本报记者何加正、新华社记者蒲立业报道：国务院今晚在京召开电话会议，表彰1989年夏季粮油创高产达标单位。田纪云副总理代表国务院向达标单位表示祝贺和感谢，并要求各地加强领导，再接再厉，千方百计夺取秋季农业丰产丰收。
    表彰大会由国务委员陈俊生主持。农业部部长何康在会上宣读了达标单位名单（全部名单将于明日刊登在本报第五版），有16个省、市、自治区，和62个地（市），以及358个县（市、区）级单位，分别达标。这些单位在今年开展的全国夏季粮油创高产活动中，有的粮、油单产达到标准，有的粮、油总产达到标准，还有的粮、油单总产双双达标，都在夺取夏季粮油丰收方面，做出了突出贡献。
    田纪云在表彰会上说，夏季粮油生产首战告捷，意义重大。它不仅有利于缓解当前市场供给与需求的矛盾，稳定物价，稳定局势，安定人心，而且为夺取今年的农业全面丰收，为平息反革命暴乱并取得彻底胜利，奠定了较好的思想和物质基础。事实再次说明，我国8亿农民和广大干部是热爱共产党、拥护社会主义制度的，农村这一社会主义阵地是巩固的。
    田纪云就如何夺取今年农业全面丰收，向各地提出六项要求：一、要充分认识夺取秋季农业丰收的艰巨性。决不能由于夏季粮油丰收而盲目乐观、松劲麻痹，必须坚持不懈，环环扣紧，力争全年全面丰收。二、切实抓好夏季粮油收购工作。粮食部门一定要严格执行国家有关收购政策，保证及时兑现挂钩物资和有关政策。各级政府要积极组织各级银行、财政、商业等部门，多渠道筹措资金，防止收购打“白条”，但不能因为资金紧而不积极收购。各地在以县为单位完成夏季粮油合同定购任务以后，要立即放开粮油市场，实行多渠道经营，防止地区封锁和层层设卡，防止哄抬价格，多家抢购。三、千方百计扩大复种面积。各地一定要见缝插针，因地制宜地提高复种指数，力争多种一些。四、认真推广农业先进技术。要完成今年的增产计划，在确保播种面积的同时，必须认真落实“丰收计划”，推动各项增产增收措施的普及，努力提高单产。五、积极增加农用生产资料生产，改进专营工作，搞好供应。六、认真做好各项防灾抗灾工作。当前汛期已到，有关地区要认真搞好抗洪救灾工作，必须确保长江、黄河、淮河等大江大河不出大的问题。其他地方的各级人民政府决不能麻痹，要认真组织有关部门，加强各种灾害的预报和监测，积极做好抗灾准备，把防灾抗灾落到实处。
    国务院秘书长罗干、副秘书长李昌安和国务院有关部门的负责同志出席了会议。
