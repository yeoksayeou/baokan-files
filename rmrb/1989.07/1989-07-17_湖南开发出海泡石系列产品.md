Hunan Develops Sea Foam Stone Series Products

XINHUA, Changsha, July 17 — Reporter Du Ruoyuan reports: Hunan Province has successively developed a series of sea foam stone products, demonstrating new progress in this field domestically.

Sea foam stone mud powder, which plays an important role in petroleum drilling, has been successfully developed by Yonghe Mining Area in Liuyang County. After appraisal and testing, it has been proven to meet international standards. Mineral feed additives made primarily from sea foam stone have superior chemical and physical properties compared to other additives and have a significant effect on the growth of chickens and pigs.

Other developed products include sea foam stone coatings, desiccants, cleaning milk, and refrigerator deodorizers.

Sea foam stone is a rare mineral resource. It is reported that the world's current proven reserves are approximately 30 million tons. Hunan's proven reserves are 12 million tons, ranking first in the country.
