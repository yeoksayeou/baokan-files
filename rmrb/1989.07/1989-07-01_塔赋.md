The tower is known as the "Twin Towers," standing tall in the bustling city center. From the outside, the two towers stand side by side, but their internal structures are connected, much like conjoined twins. It is said to be built on the site where the warlord Wu Peifu massacred striking railway workers, serving as a reminder to future generations not to forget history, and to commemorate and honor the heroic spirits!

As a symbol of the city, it is magnificent. Today's tourists may not all know the history it embodies, but history is indeed gloriously inscribed there. Half a century of ups and downs, how many historical records have been written? No one can say for sure, but many people are asking questions.

I am also asking questions. 35 years ago, in that summer, how did I develop such a strong desire to learn? Wearing a red scarf, carrying a bag of steamed buns made by my mother, I traveled from the north bank of the Yellow River to this city on the south bank to take an exam. With no relatives or friends, I and my group of young companions slept in the very place where the towers now stand. There was a patch of wild grass, enclosed by a wooden fence, with a few wooden sticks crossed and a lantern hanging from them, which someone always lit, casting a dim, flickering light in the evening. I came for the green patch, not knowing the sanctity of the wild grass garden. For seven nights, I had beautiful dreams each night. Two months later, when I became an official citizen of this city, I don't know what prompted me to pay my first and most sincere tribute to the wild grass garden and the lantern that still cast its dim light. I even noticed that many people hurried through the colorful commercial street, came to the grassy area, and then slowed their pace and lowered their voices, as if searching for something, asking something, or pondering something. If this city truly has a soul, I think that soul lingers in that patch of green wild grass, which I read from the sacred looks in many people's eyes!

Time generously flows by, and everything changes, rising and falling. However, no matter how much darkness or bloodshed there is, the soul that serves as the flag of the city will not disperse. Its unique call and cohesion will support the passage of time. Surrounding that sacred green, I have, with the memories of 35 years ago, searched the streets today many times. Searching for what? I am not sure. Hearing the train's whistle, I think of the thatched waiting room of the old station; a car speeds past me, and I remember that this wide road was once a muddy ditch. The towering buildings block my view, but through the walls, I see the outlines and directions of the old alleys, the dirty streets, and the low houses; a prominent commercial advertisement brings back memories of the old appearances of a few, a dozen, or even several dozen shops; a breeze blows by, and I see the unforgettable sandstorms of the past...

In my search, I have climbed the tower three times to look far and wide. The base of the tower is where the lantern once hung, and the vast square is no longer covered in wild grass. Surrounding the tower are pine trees, cypresses, and a sea of flowers. Red lights flash on the tall iron poles at the top of the tower, and within the brilliant halo, does the light of that dim, flickering lantern still shine? Seeing so much, thinking of so much, I can't help but blend myself into this city, because its blood carries the aspirations of my youth and early adulthood, and now it carries my middle-aged body, sharing the burden of the times with it. In fact, 35 years is not all roses and wine. When my pursuits, my struggles, and my efforts intertwine with this city, everything before my eyes suddenly becomes a "Chronicle of the Years." If we divide the 35 years into several historical periods, it is in the 10 years closest to today that the vivid colors of the times have diluted various colorful hues, seeking harmony in disharmony, seeking clarity in ambiguity, making the "Chronicle of the Years" show its most dazzling brilliance. The Twin Towers standing in the bustling city center are the indelible heart of this picture?

    塔赋
    卞卡
    那座塔被称为“双塔”，矗立在闹市区。从外观审视，两塔并立，内部结构则相通，很像连体婴儿。据说就建在当年军阀吴佩孚屠杀大罢工铁路健儿的地方，为的是昭示后来者不忘历史，也为彪炳与垂悼雄风赫然的英魂！
    作为一座城市的象征，它是辉煌的。今日的游人虽不可能全都知道它所包容的那段历史，但历史毕竟辉煌地写在那里。半个多世纪的风风雨雨，历史的碑帖写出了多少？没有人说得清楚，却有许多人在发问。
    我也在发问。35年前的那个夏季，我怎么萌生了那么大的求知欲？戴着红领巾，背着娘为我打的烧饼，从黄河北岸，来到黄河南岸这座城市里应试；无亲无故，我同我的一群小伙伴露宿的地方正是而今建塔的所在。那里有一片荒草，被木栅栏圈着，草丛中几根木棍交叉拢起，上挂一盏风灯，总有人点燃，晚间发出昏黄的、摇曳的光。我只是扑着那片绿来的，还不知道那荒草园子的神圣。7个夜晚，每晚都有美丽的梦。两个月后，当我成为这座城市的正式公民时，不知出于怎样的心理，我第一次极其虔诚地凭吊了那荒草园子，还有那盏依然散出昏黄光亮的风灯。我甚至发现，许多人步履匆匆，穿过那条花花绿绿的商业街，来到那片草地旁，然后放慢脚步，然后放低声音，仿佛在寻找什么，叩问什么，思索什么。这座城市如果真的有魂魄的话，我倒觉得那魂魄就萦系在那片绿色的荒草园子，这是我从许多人的目光流露出的圣洁里读到的！
    时光慷慨地流逝着，一切在变化中升降沉浮。然而，不管怎样的阴霾四布，也不管怎样的腥风血雨，作为一座城市的旗帜的魂魄是不会离散的。它那独特的号召力和凝聚力，将支撑住时代的嬗递。围绕那片神圣的绿，我曾带着35年前的记忆，多次在今日的街头寻觅。寻觅什么？我不清楚。听到火车的鸣笛声，我会想起曾经有过的芦席搭就的车站候车室；一辆汽车从我身边疾驰而过，我会记起面前这条宽阔的马路不就是原先的那条泥沟吗？那拔地而起的大厦挡住了我的视线，但透过大厦的墙壁，我却看到了昔日几条小巷的轮廓和走向，还有那肮脏的街面，低矮的房舍；一幅醒目的商业广告，呼出了我对几家、十几家甚至几十家店铺旧貌的记忆；一阵清风吹过，眼前浮现的竟是忘不了的昔日风沙弥漫时的昏天黑地……
    寻寻觅觅中我三次登塔望远。塔基正是当年悬挂风灯之处，偌大的广场不见了荒草，簇拥塔身的是苍松翠柏和花卉的海洋。有红灯在塔顶高耸的铁柱上闪烁，灿灿光环里可曾糅进那盏昏黄而摇曳的风灯的光明？看到许许多多，想到许许多多，我便情不自禁地把自己溶进了这座城市里，因为它的血脉里也涌流着我少年、青年的憧憬，而今又载着我中年的躯体同它一起承受住时代的重荷。其实，35年岁月对一个人来说并不意味着都是鲜花和美酒。当我的追求，我的奋进，我的拚搏与我所在的这座城市交织在一起的时候，我眼前的一切顿时变成了一幅《岁月图》。如果把35年划分若干历史阶段，正是贴近今天的10年间，时代的重彩才稀释了这样那样多彩的色块，在不协调中求协调，在不明朗中求明朗，使得这《岁月图》显示出它的最夺目的光彩，而矗立于闹市区的双塔，便是这幅画图的不可泯灭的心了？
