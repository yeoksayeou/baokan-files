Scientific socialism theorists recently held a meeting in Jilin City, proposing that "the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the nation and also the foundation of scientific socialism theory."

Vice President Wang Zhen sent a congratulatory message to the conference, hoping that the attendees would "theoretically explore and study how to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to the correct direction of reform and opening up under socialism, and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization."

The meeting believed that due to Zhao Ziyang's passive attitude towards upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and his public advocacy of the idea that "socialism is unclear," the result was chaos and harm to scientific socialism theory work. On one hand, it gave the green light to those advocating bourgeois liberalization, allowing them to attack socialism and promote bourgeois liberalization under the cover of "uncertainty." On the other hand, it severely damaged the research, propaganda, and education work of scientific socialism theory, reduced research institutions, almost completely eliminated scientific socialism teaching in universities, and severely weakened the popularization of scientific socialism education. This is one of the important reasons for the "crisis of faith in socialism" in recent years.

The meeting believed that the proposal of scientific socialism theory is a great contribution by Marx and Engels. It deeply reveals the laws of social development. From a general and fundamental perspective, the qualitative characteristics of socialism are clear. Its non-fundamental and non-essential characteristics change with the different stages and practices of socialism. Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is both the essential characteristic of socialism in the current stage and the fundamental guarantee for the continuous self-improvement of scientific socialism theory.

The meeting pointed out that since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the research on scientific socialism theory has seen significant development and painful lessons. One of the important tasks in the current ideological and theoretical circles is to rectify and clarify the scientific socialism theory issues that have been confused by bourgeois liberalization in recent years. The attendees believed that in economic development, it is necessary to adhere to the public ownership system; in the ideological field, it is necessary to adhere to Marxism as the guiding ideology; in the choice of the modernization development path, it is necessary to adhere to the socialist direction; in political system reform, it is necessary to adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party. These are unshakable principles.

The seminar was jointly held by the China Scientific Socialism Society and the Jilin Provincial Federation of Social Sciences in Jilin City. More than 50 theorists participated in the meeting.

    科学社会主义理论工作者在吉林市开会提出
    四项基本原则是立论之本
    王震祝辞希望探讨如何坚持四项基本原则
    新华社长春7月29日电　（记者杜晓明）最近召开的中国社会主义40年理论研讨会提出：“四项基本原则是立国之本，也是科学社会主义理论工作的立论之本。”
    国家副主席王震给会议发来了祝辞，他希望与会同志“从理论上探讨、研究好如何坚持四项基本原则，坚持社会主义正确方向的改革开放，切实反对资产阶级自由化”。
    会议认为，由于赵紫阳同志消极对待坚持四项基本原则，公开宣扬社会主义“讲不清楚”，结果给科学社会主义理论工作造成了混乱、带来了危害：一方面为搞资产阶级自由化的人开了绿灯，使他们可以在“讲不清楚”的掩护下放肆地攻击社会主义、鼓吹资产阶级自由化；另一方面使科学社会主义理论的研究、宣传和教育工作遭到极大的破坏，研究机构被大量缩减，高校科学社会主义教学几乎完全被取消，群众性的科学社会主义普及教育被严重削弱。这是造成近几年社会主义“信仰危机”的重要原因之一。
    会议认为，科学社会主义理论的提出是马克思和恩格斯的一个巨大贡献，它深刻地揭示了社会发展的规律；从总的方面、基本方面来讲，社会主义的质的规定性是清楚的，它的非基本方面、非本质特征则随着社会主义不同阶段和实践的发展而不同。坚持四项基本原则既是现阶段社会主义发展的本质特征，也是科学社会主义理论不断自我完善的根本保障。
    会议指出，十一届三中全会以来，科学社会主义理论研究既有重大发展，又有沉痛教训。当前思想理论界的重要任务之一就是要对近几年被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的科学社会主义理论问题进行正本清源。与会同志认为，在经济发展上坚持以公有制为主体；在意识形态领域中坚持以马克思主义为指导；在现代化发展道路的选择上坚持社会主义方向；在政治体制改革中坚持共产党领导下的多党合作制，这是不可动摇的原则。
    研讨会是由中国科学社会主义学会和吉林省社联联合在吉林市召开的。50多位理论工作者参加了会议。
