The Polish government has decided to freeze prices and wages nationwide starting from July 1.

This decision was made at a meeting of the Council of Ministers today. The meeting noted that Poland is currently facing severe inflation, deteriorating market supply, and worsening fiscal conditions.

To quickly halt the current economic decline, the Council of Ministers passed a resolution outlining economic planning principles until 1992. It also stipulated that from now on, no new special-funded projects will be initiated, and no new tax exemptions or reductions will be implemented. The Council of Ministers also decided to propose to various trade union organizations and the newly formed parliament, which will soon begin work, to liberalize food prices starting from August 1 and fully implement food marketization. To prevent market panic before this, it was decided to freeze all retail and wholesale prices, state subsidies, and workers' wages starting from tomorrow until the food market is opened.

In the past month, Poland's economic situation has significantly deteriorated, with production declining and market supply becoming increasingly tight. To ease market pressure, the Polish government has successively raised the prices of some food and daily necessities. This has sparked widespread social discontent.

According to Polish officials, Poland's inflation rate has reached three digits. The government's efforts to secure Western loans have also not met expectations.

    波兰政府通过决议
    在全国冻结物价和工资
    新华社华沙6月30日电（记者董福生）波兰政府决定从7月1日起在全国冻结物价和工资。
    这是波兰部长会议在今天举行的会议上作出的决定。会议认为，波兰当前通货膨胀加剧，市场供应进一步恶化，国家财政状况更加拮据。
    为了尽快制止当前的经济滑坡现象，部长会议通过决议，提出了直到1992年的经济计划原则，并规定从现在起禁止开工新的专项拨资项目和禁止实施新的减免税的措施。部长会议还决定，向各工会组织以及即将开始工作的新的议会提出建议，建议从8月1日起放开食品价格，充分实行食品经济市场化。为了防止在此之前发生市场恐慌，决定从明天起冻结一切零售和批发价格，冻结国家补贴，冻结职工工资，直到开放食品市场时为止。
    最近一个多月来，波兰的经济形势明显恶化，生产下降，市场供应日趋紧张。为了缓和市场压力，波兰政府先后提高了一些食品和日用工业品的价格。这引起了社会的广泛不满。
    据波兰官方人士透露，波兰通货膨胀指数已达到3位数字。政府谋求西方贷款的努力也未达到预期目的。
