	Surveying Troops Measure Water and Mountains, Achieving Remarkable Results in Supporting Construction

	People's Daily reports: In recent years, the surveying troops of the People's Liberation Army have made significant contributions to supporting China's modernization.

	It is understood that the surveying soldiers have provided accurate measurement data for every scientific exploration and technical test of artificial earth satellites launched by China. The marine surveying troops have traversed the Bohai Sea, Yellow Sea, East China Sea, and South China Sea in recent years, conducting surveys of coastal topography, water depth, and the detection of navigation obstacles. They have also re-surveyed the water areas of more than ten coastal ports, compiling and publishing various nautical charts and navigation guides, which have facilitated maritime exchanges between China and other countries. When national key projects and mineral exploration urgently need surveying support, the surveying troops have dispatched a large number of soldiers with good political awareness, excellent skills, and strong work ethic to provide assistance. In the past two years, the surveying soldiers have used gravimetric measurement methods to support oil exploration in the eastern part of the Ordos Basin and the old revolutionary base areas of northern Shaanxi; they have provided relevant surveying data and materials for the Shengli Oilfield, Dalian's Biliuhe Project, Zibo Ethylene Project, Kumalike River Hydropower Station in Xinjiang, Gezhouba Water Conservancy Hub, Longyangxia High-Voltage Transmission Line, and Asian Games projects.

	To accurately determine the current areas of cultivated land, forests, grasslands, wasteland, and land use in various cities in China, relevant national departments, in accordance with the deployment of the State Council, have carried out a nationwide land survey. The surveying soldiers have tenaciously tackled key problems and developed a digital cadastral surveying system, providing partial automation for the land survey.

    测绘部队测水量山  支援建设成绩斐然
    本报讯　近年来，人民解放军测绘部队为支援国家现代化建设作出了显著成绩。
    据了解，测绘兵为我国每次发射科学探测和技术试验人造地球卫星都提供了准确的测量数据。海测部队近几年踏遍渤海、黄海、东海和南海，对各个航道进行了海岸地形、水深等测量，以及航行障碍物的探测，还重新普查了沿海十多个港口的水域情况，编制出版了各种海图和航路指南，为我国与各国进行海路交往提供了方便。在国家重点工程和矿产勘探急需测绘保障时，测绘部队派出了大量思想好、技术精、作风硬的官兵进行支援。近两年来，测绘兵用重力测量手段支援了鄂尔多斯盆地东部和陕北老区的石油勘探工作；为胜利油田、大连碧流河工程、淄博乙烯工程、新疆库玛里克河水电站、葛洲坝水利枢纽、龙羊峡高压输电线路、亚运会工程等提供了有关测绘数据和资料。
    为准确弄清我国目前耕地、森林、草原、荒地面积和各城市土地利用情况，国家有关部门根据国务院的部署开展了全国性的国土调查，测绘兵顽强攻关，研制了数字地籍测量系统，为国土调查提供了部分自动化手段。
