The Agricultural Information Center of the Ministry of Agriculture recently conducted a survey of the market prices of 46 agricultural and sideline products in 24 major and medium-sized cities across the country. The survey indicates that in the first half of this year, urban residents have found that farmers' markets have an adequate supply of goods, and the price increases are significantly lower than last year. The prices of meat and vegetable sideline products have remained stable or even decreased compared to the same period last year. Although the prices of grain and oil products have risen, the increase is much lower than last year. The price differences between northern and southern cities have become more pronounced due to market mechanisms.

In the first half of this year, although the consumption of pork and eggs in major and medium-sized cities increased during the Spring Festival, leading to a temporary price increase in the markets, the increase was minimal due to sufficient supply from state-owned commercial outlets. Since March, prices have remained stable. By the end of June, pork prices were only 5% higher than the same period last year, with most cities maintaining a price of around 6 yuan per kilogram. Egg prices have decreased by 15.5% compared to December of last year, showing a significant drop. Starting in May and June, vegetable prices have fallen sharply. After a drop in the fourth quarter of last year, aquatic product prices have rebounded this year, with freshwater fish prices up by 7% compared to the same period last year.

It is worth noting that although the market prices of grain and oil products in the first half of this year have increased significantly less than last year (20-30%), they are still about 50% higher than the same period last year. In particular, the prices of corn and glutinous rice in southern cities have risen sharply. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain grain production, ensure a sufficient supply of feed, and stabilize the development of animal husbandry to secure the supply of agricultural and sideline products in major and medium-sized cities in the future.

Another issue worth noting is the significant increase in vegetable prices in southern cities. Even in southern cities, where vegetable prices are traditionally low, residents are feeling the pressure of rising vegetable prices.

    全国二十四城市统计表明
    集贸市场货源充足  价格涨势低于去年
    本报北京7月15日讯  农业部信息中心最近对全国24个大中城市的46种农副产品集市价格的统计表明：今年上半年，城市居民感到集贸市场货源充足，价格涨势明显低于去年。肉菜类副食品价格较去年同时期稳中有降。粮油类虽然有所上涨，但涨势明显低于去年。南北方城市的地区价格差异受市场机制的作用明显拉开。
    今年上半年，大中城市的猪肉、禽蛋消费量虽然在春节期间增加，集市价格一度上涨，但因国营商业供应量充足，涨幅很小。3月份以来，价格一直平稳。6月下旬，猪肉价格与去年同期相比只上涨5％，绝大多数城市的猪肉价格稳定在每公斤6元左右。鲜蛋价格比去年12月下降15.5％，明显回落。进入5、6月份以来，蔬菜价格大幅度回落。水产品价格在去年第4季度一度下跌后，今年又有回升，其中，淡水鱼与去年同期比较，上涨了7％。
    值得注意的是，粮油类产品今年上半年集市价格上涨幅度虽然明显低于去年20—30％，但仍高于去年同期50％左右。特别是南方城市玉米、粳米价格上涨幅度大。因此，不放松粮食生产，保证充足的饲料供应，稳住畜牧业发展态势是今后保证大中城市农副产品供应的主要任务。
    另一个值得注意的问题是，南方城市蔬菜价格大幅度上涨。在一向以蔬菜价格低廉的南方城市，居民也感到蔬菜价格的压力。
