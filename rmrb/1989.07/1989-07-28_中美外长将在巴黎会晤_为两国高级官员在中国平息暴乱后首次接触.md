Chinese and U.S. Foreign Ministers to Meet in Paris

For the First High-Level Contact Between the Two Countries Since the Suppression of the Riots in China

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 27 (Reporter Huai Chengbo) – State Department spokesman Richard Boucher today said at a press conference that U.S. Secretary of State James Baker will meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen in Paris on the 30th. The two sides will discuss the events in China and the Cambodian issue.

Baker's meeting with Qian will be the first high-level contact between the two countries since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. The Bush administration announced the suspension of high-level contacts between the two countries shortly after the Beijing incident.

Baker and Qian will attend the international conference on the Cambodian issue, which is scheduled to open on Sunday in Paris.

Boucher said today in response to a reporter's question that the French side is responsible for the seating arrangements of the attendees, and Baker and Qian will have adjacent seats in the conference hall; therefore, "it would be absurd if they do not meet each other."

She added, "As to whether a formal bilateral meeting has been arranged, I cannot answer."

At yesterday's White House press conference, when a reporter asked about the policy of stopping ministerial-level exchanges between the two countries, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "Secretary Baker formulated this policy, and he can also change this policy."

    中美外长将在巴黎会晤
    为两国高级官员在中国平息暴乱后首次接触
    新华社华盛顿7月27日电　（记者怀成波）国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天在新闻发布会上说，美国国务卿贝克将于30日在巴黎会见中国外长钱其琛，双方将讨论在中国发生的事件以及柬埔寨问题。
    贝克同钱其琛的会晤将是中国平息反革命暴乱以来两国高级官员的第一次会见。布什政府在北京事件后不久宣布停止两国高级官员的接触。
    贝克和钱其琛将参加定于星期日在巴黎开幕的关于柬埔寨问题国际会议。
    塔特怀勒今天在回答记者提问时说，法国方面负责与会者的座次安排，贝克同钱其琛在会议厅内的座位相邻；因此，“如果他们不互相见面，是荒唐的”。
    她接着说，“至于是否安排了正式双边会谈，我无法回答”。
    在昨天举行的白宫新闻发布会上，当有记者问到有关美中两国停止部长一级来往的政策是否仍然有效时，白宫发言人库珀说，“贝克国务卿制订了这一政策，他也可以改变这一政策”。
