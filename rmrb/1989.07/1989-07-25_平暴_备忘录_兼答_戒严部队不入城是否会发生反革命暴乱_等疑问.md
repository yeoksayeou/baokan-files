From mid-April's student movement to the suppression of the counterrevolutionary riot, the entire process lasted about two months. This heart-wrenching two months saw the ebb and flow of events, and countless people experienced the emotional seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, as well as the baptism of blood and fire in their souls. The People's Liberation Army, in this special and severe political struggle, "passed the test" and used blood and life to defend the leadership of the Party and the socialist system. The young republic once again recorded the great victory of defending sovereignty and crushing subversion in its annals.

This turmoil was bound to come, determined by the international climate and China's own microclimate, and was not subject to human will. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's judgment was far-sighted and insightful, clearly explaining the inevitability of this struggle.

Just as observing a mountain range requires standing at the peak to see its direction, recognizing complex historical events also requires standing at the height that the times allow, to understand its inevitable trend of occurrence and development.

Since the suppression of the riot, some people have occasionally made various speculations, such as: If Beijing did not impose martial law or if martial law troops did not enter the city, would there have been a counterrevolutionary riot? Some people even raised the accusation that "martial law in Beijing came first, the turmoil came later, the military entered the city first, and the riot came later." Good-hearted people, either temporarily unable to accept such harsh facts, or as bystanders not understanding the full truth of the situation, produce some doubts that are understandable. Some people are deeply involved, their thoughts and emotions temporarily unable to turn around, looking for some reasons to either balance their conflicting psychology or to defend their own mistakes, which is also understandable. It seems that to reach a correct consensus, we need to transcend our own limitations, abandon personal grudges, and stand at the height of safeguarding national interests and security, expanding the vision of observing the entire situation, to make a wise judgment on the inevitability of this struggle. As for a few people with ulterior motives, raising various accusations to confuse the public, facts will give a stern refutation.

From Dulles' prediction to the "Voice of America" rumors

The prediction by Dulles, the U.S. Secretary of State in the 1950s, that the hope of peaceful evolution would be placed on the third and fourth generations of the Chinese Communist Party is unfamiliar to young people in their twenties today. After entering the 1980s, peace and development gradually became the theme of the contemporary world. Years of peaceful life made many people lose vigilance against the danger of "peaceful evolution." In fact, in the past decade, the reactionary forces of international capitalism believed that utilizing the temporary difficulties and reforms of socialist countries was the best opportunity to implement the strategy of "victory without war" and "peaceful evolution." Therefore, they intensified political and ideological infiltration and subversion from within.

They used "democracy, freedom, and human rights" as a banner to peddle capitalist parliamentary and multi-party systems. They took advantage of the twists and turns in the international communist movement to widely propagandize that "communism is dead" and proposed to encourage the "liberalization trend of socialist countries," support "all strikes, student movements, and ethnic conflicts that weaken the leadership of the Communist Party," provide political asylum for "dissidents," and strongly support "opposition parties."

They took advantage of China's opening up to spread capitalist individualistic values and decadent lifestyles through various media, seeking to implement "soft landing" in ideological and cultural concepts and corrupt the spiritual pillar of communism.

The "Voice of America" in recent times has reached the level of delusion in its anti-China performance. It extended the broadcasting time to China, increased the frequency of broadcasts, spread rumors, and incited trouble, fully exposing the desperate and enraged face of their failed attempt to subvert the socialist system. It can be said that without the incitement and support of the "Voice of America" and other international reactionary mouthpieces, this turmoil and counterrevolutionary riot would not have developed to such a serious extent. The West, led by the United States, played a crucial role in the rapid deterioration of the situation.

From "military counterattack" to "political landing"

For the past 40 years since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan have always dreamed of counterattacking the mainland. With the changes in the international situation and the consolidation of the socialist system, the "military counterattack" is no longer feasible. They ignored the calls for national reunification from all walks of life and gradually shifted their strategy to so-called "political landing," carrying out "soft attacks," and never gave up planned and organized psychological warfare and subversion activities.

In recent times, they have accelerated the pace of "political landing" in coordination with the international anti-China wave of so-called "democratic freedom movements" and the liberalization trend of the mainland bourgeoisie. Especially since last year, the reactionary forces in Taiwan and Hong Kong have been vigorously advocating for the "democratization and liberalization of the mainland as soon as possible," directing their attacks at the older generation of revolutionaries, attacking the leadership of the Communist Party of China, attacking the socialist system, and advocating the so-called "Taiwan experience," attempting to influence the mainland to develop in a direction favorable to "liberalization."

In April and May, the Kuomintang Central Standing Committee and the "Executive Yuan" held multiple meetings to discuss the mainland's student movement, proposing to "more actively and proactively support the democratic freedom movement on the mainland." The Kuomintang's propaganda machine also worked at full capacity, conducting large-scale rumor-mongering, slander, and incitement.

In this farce, a certain key figure in the "National Security Council" initiated the "Send Love to Tiananmen" activity, leading the donation of 100,000 New Taiwan dollars and establishing the "Support Mainland Democratic Movement Fund" by the "Economic Department Investment Office." Some people from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and the United States and Britain, whose identities were unclear, carried large sums of money into Beijing to support the "High Autonomy Federation" and "Workers' Autonomy Federation," allowing these illegal organizations to buy thugs to burn military vehicles, seize weapons, and kidnap and harm soldiers.

The "Mainland Work Guidance Group" of Taiwan believed that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for "political landing," sending a large number of spies to the mainland to carry out activities, directly intervening in the turmoil and riot. The Taiwan special agency ordered spies in various places, "This time the Communist Party is really going to collapse," to "coordinate with the situation in the region, secretly instigate student movements."

The reactionary forces in Taiwan and Hong Kong and illegal political organizations such as the "Chinese Democratic Alliance" abroad, along with a few people who have long been stubbornly holding liberalization positions and providing the Party and state's core secrets to illegal organizations, have long established a subtle connection. When the situation is unfavorable, their response is either clear or vague, like ghost fires flickering high and low; when the situation is favorable, they openly collude, joining forces in evil. In this student movement, turmoil, and riot, they coordinated very well. This is something that many good-hearted people cannot imagine.

From "Beijing Spring" to "Beijing Riot"

The bourgeois liberalization trend began shortly after the end of the Cultural Revolution. It has had about three high tides so far. Insisting on the four cardinal principles and promoting bourgeois liberalization has always been the focus of the struggle.

The first was the so-called "Beijing Spring" movement in 1979. At that time, the leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation" were still children around 10 years old. The Party was then leading the people to correct mistakes and rectify the situation. Some people, taking advantage of the Party's setbacks during the "Cultural Revolution" and the social problems left over from the Lin Biao and the "Gang of Four" period, colluded with political forces in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and abroad, using the "great democracy" method of the "Cultural Revolution," inciting trouble, and advocating that "the root of all evil is the dictatorship of the proletariat" and that "the Chinese Communist Party must be thoroughly criticized." They believed that the current issue in China was not about modernizing the four aspects but should be about carrying out capitalist-style social reforms. To prevent the reform and opening-up from deviating from the correct direction, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly proposed to insist on the four cardinal principles, repelling this reverse current.

The second high tide appeared at the end of 1986. Unlike the previous one, after experiencing the student movements of 1985 and 1986, those promoting liberalization put forward figures like Fang Lizhi, Wang Ruowang, and Liu Binyan, clearly proposing slogans against the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist path, advocating "complete Westernization," and bringing the capitalist system to China. Because the instigators of the liberalization trend were some famous people, they had great deceptive and inciting power among young students. The Party organization resolutely expelled these few key figures. Comrade Deng Xiaoping once again solemnly warned the entire Party that in the process of reform and opening-up, it is necessary to strengthen the education of the four cardinal principles and to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization.

This time, it was the pinnacle. A few people had begun to brew and plan as early as the end of last year. They proposed to accept the lessons of previous "democratic movements," "definitely to have organization, planning, and a program to proceed," "to gain broad sympathy and support from the international community," "to mobilize all sectors of society to form collective pressure on the government," "to go all the way and not give up halfway."

They used so-called "democratic salons," "freedom forums," and various reports and seminars, both inside and outside universities, large and small wall posters and speeches, Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers, to create public opinion. The fundamental slogans remained two: overthrow the Communist Party and overthrow the socialist system. They formed a relatively systematic set of theoretical views against the four cardinal principles, such as: "Socialism is a disease, privatization and privatization are the only way out"; "the leadership of the Communist Party is an obstacle to democratic politics"; "from the freedom of association to new party leadership, democracy has global commonality"; "Marxism has died in China, we must thoroughly negate Mao Zedong Thought"; "the goal of reform is to move towards developed societies like the United States, Western Europe, and Japan," etc. They peddled these political proposals everywhere; some were naked expressions, while others were disguised as reform theory explorations. It is not difficult to see that their ultimate goal is to establish a completely Western-dependent bourgeois republic.

They learned a lesson from the previous two "failures": relying on a few "Xidan Wall members" in the "Beijing Spring" movement and a few key figures in the "second high tide" to incite students would not create a big situation and would be easily exposed by the masses. This time, Fang Lizhi and others who have long been stubbornly holding liberalization positions, colluding with overseas and foreign hostile forces, providing the Party and state's core secrets to illegal organizations, joined forces, forming the so-called "core of the movement." Some of them were already "three-term elders" of the liberalization movement, cunning and experienced. They organized and planned behind the scenes, while cunningly pushing students to the forefront, even not hesitating to use students as hostages, inciting the masses' antagonism towards the Party and the government.

They secretly instructed the leaders of the student movement: "First, we need to smear the Youth League and the Student Union, so the government won't have any help"; "If all colleges and universities establish joint organizations, they can immediately replace the All-China Federation of Students. In the Communist Party system, establishing the first spontaneous student federation will have a great impact on the entire political situation of China. Once it starts, it will be a million-strong army." Their goal was clear: they wanted to establish an opposition party through this activity and engage in long-term struggle. On April 26, the "Beijing College Students' Self-Government Federation" (i.e., "High Autonomy Federation") was officially established. Initially, it was called the "United Student Union," intending to make it like the Polish Solidarity Union, but later felt that this name exposed the intention to establish an opposition party too obviously, so it was changed to "High Autonomy Federation." Subsequently, Beijing and various places across the country saw the emergence of a large number of illegal organizations.

On April 21, when the turmoil was just forming, Peking University and Renmin University posted a revealing material titled "It Turns Out to Be a Conspiracy," signed by "A Waker from Peking University." It said: "A key figure in the action said that the most emotional thing in front of Zhongnanhai is to provoke the police. As long as the police move, there is an excuse to expand the matter." "It turns out that the action was pre-arranged. The first step is to use the mourning of Hu Yaobang to conveniently propose political demands. Li (Shuxian) teacher said that Hu's rehabilitation should be placed first, so the government would have nothing to say. The second demand should not be about rehabilitating those who were suppressed for liberalization, as that would be too detached from the masses and easily cause misunderstandings. The rehabilitation of Fang (Lizhi) teacher should be hidden in the background. Moreover, the masses hate corruption, so use this point to attack them. The second step is to sit in front of Zhongnanhai, and if necessary, push inside. As long as the police dare to intervene, it is beating people, thus arousing the sympathy of students, especially female students. The third step is to demand to participate in the funeral, many people have this mentality, thus making the matter even bigger and pushing it nationwide." This awakened student said at the beginning: "I experienced a painful reflection yesterday, but I still put my conscience first and told the truth to everyone based on facts, so that we would not become the sacrificial lambs of the conspirators." Unfortunately, there were too few such "awakeners" at that time! From the revealed facts, from the student movement to the turmoil, and finally to the sudden outbreak of the riot, it was all under the meticulous direction of the conspirators. They used such cunning means to implement their reactionary political program. From the above, it can be seen that they were determined this time, not to give up until their goal was achieved.

"Clear banner" and "unclear banner"

The old generation of revolutionaries who led the Chinese people to liberation and established the cause of reform and opening-up have always been highly vigilant against the danger of the People's Republic being subverted and have always maintained the sovereignty of the People's Republic. At the 12th National Congress of the Party, Comrade Deng Xiaoping solemnly declared: "No foreign country should expect China to be their vassal, nor should they expect China to swallow the bitter fruit that harms our interests." To the domestic liberalization trend that is attached to the international reactionary tide, the old generation of revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as the representative, have always clearly and resolutely resisted, preventing political turmoil.

As early as ten years ago, Comrade Deng Xiaoping reminded the entire Party that the plots of those who engage in political conspiracies, those so-called "democratic freedom factions," those anarchists and extreme individualists, etc., "although these few types of people have different natures, they can completely unite under certain conditions and become a destructive force, causing considerable turmoil and losses. This situation occurred last year and may occur in the future." In recent years, he repeatedly warned the entire Party: opposing bourgeois liberalization is not only something that needs to be talked about now but also something that needs to be talked about for a long time, throughout the entire modernization process. On how to prevent the spread of liberalization trends and the resulting evil consequences, he repeatedly emphasized, "the leadership must have a clear banner, and the masses will be able to see clearly," "wherever there is turmoil, it is because the leadership's attitude is not firm and the banner is not clear."

However, over the years, these important thoughts and policies have not been consistently implemented well within our Party; some leaders have not been clear about insisting on the four cardinal principles and have not carried out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization to the end. The student unrest in 1986 was the result of not being clear and firm in opposing liberalization. At that time, General Secretary Hu Yaobang made a serious mistake on this issue. The outbreak of this turmoil was also due to the fact that after Comrade Zhao Ziyang took over as General Secretary, he did not consistently carry out the struggle against liberalization, passively dealing with the insistence on the four cardinal principles, encouraging and exacerbating the spread of liberalization trends, resulting in extremely serious consequences.

When the capitalist world overcame the post-war crisis and regained rapid development in science and technology and production, some people were surprised and confused. At the same time, socialism encountered twists and turns in its development, failing to fully demonstrate its superiority, affecting its image in people's minds. Reform and opening-up brought new vitality to socialism. After the "ten years of chaos," the people, who deeply felt the backwardness of China's economy and culture, had a stronger desire for development and reform than ever before. If the leaders were not clear-headed, while insisting on economic construction as the center and accelerating reform and opening-up, they did not clearly insist on the four cardinal principles, relaxed spiritual civilization construction and ideological and political work, not only would social productivity not develop, but it would also lead to the weakening of the Party's cohesion, causing social unrest. This would inevitably lead to historical mistakes, bringing great disasters to the country and the people.

If...

Looking at the international and domestic climates, we can see that the outbreak of this turmoil is not surprising. It is the result of the long-term infiltration and subversion of international capitalist reactionary forces, the long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization trends in China, and the connection with international anti-China trends. It is also the inevitable result of some people within the Party resonating with liberalization trends and the Party's leaders not consistently insisting on the four cardinal principles. This is not an isolated, accidental event. It is not the "through dialogue, mutual concessions, and giving face" that good-hearted people imagine, nor is it "forced out by improper government measures." Instead, it is the result of the interaction of large and small climates, long-term planning, and inevitable occurrence, not subject to human will.

When people lack a deep understanding of the inevitability of a historical event, they often propose various assumptions. After the suppression of the riot, many people, reflecting on the development and outcome of the situation, inevitably had many "ifs" in their minds.

Any complex historical event contains both necessary and accidental factors. The necessary factors determine the irreversible development trend of things, while the accidental factors manifest the necessity through the specific process of things' development.

If Comrade Hu Yaobang had not died on April 15, the turmoil would still have been incited on the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, etc.

If the government had agreed to their political conditions through dialogue during the students' hunger strike, denied the "April 26" editorial, and recognized their illegal organizations, they would not have given up and would still have continued to create incidents and expand the situation with other excuses; they would still have established an opposition party after the legalization of illegal organizations and engaged in long-term struggle.

If martial law had not been imposed on parts of Beijing on May 20, and the martial law troops had not forcibly entered the city on June 3, they would still have continued to escalate the turmoil and riot, expanding it nationwide, forcing the government to step down, or using the so-called "storming of the Bastille" to overthrow the socialist republic.

Similarly, if on the evening of June 2, the People's Liberation Army's jeep borrowed by the Central Television Station had not caused a traffic accident, they would still have found other excuses to launch a counterrevolutionary riot. Such despicable tricks, haven't people learned enough in the past 60-plus days?

There are many such accidental "ifs." No matter how many "ifs," they cannot escape the constraints of necessity.

From the cause of this turmoil, there is such a necessary "if," that is: if the Party and the government had made further concessions and not decisively used state power to restore order, then we would have to pay a higher price, and the great achievements of ten years of reform would be destroyed in an instant, and the People's Republic might be doomed.

The spirit of the army in the crucible

"Humiliation is a punishment more difficult to bear than death... What a cruel spiritual torture! If one does not have a heart that loves the people, it is impossible to do this. Therefore, I can say that the great Chinese soldiers, you have created a miracle for all of humanity." - A reporter from Liaoning Daily

Originally, from the publication of the "April 26" editorial to the "May Fourth" speech, the situation had eased. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's "May Fourth" speech was the turning point for the escalation of the turmoil. Beijing was increasingly falling into a state of serious anarchy. The turmoil in Beijing was spreading nationwide. In the face of the insufficient strength of the public security system in Beijing and the ineffectiveness of administrative measures to solve problems, and in the face of the urgent situation of nationwide chaos, quickly stabilizing the situation in the capital had become the key to stabilizing the entire country.

The Party and the government, with no choice but to follow the constitutional provisions, ordered the State Council to impose martial law on parts of Beijing. Before the martial law order was announced, a few people who had access to the Party and state's core secrets immediately informed the illegal organizations. The organizers of the turmoil immediately changed from hunger strikes to sit-ins, spreading political rumors, organizing the purchase of thugs, and inciting the uninformed masses to set up roadblocks and block military vehicles everywhere, exacerbating the turmoil. It can be seen that the saying "martial law first, turmoil later" is purely baseless.

To handle such a complex situation with unclear lines and intertwined contradictions, the maximum avoidance of conflict and bloodshed requires sufficient deterrent force. The greater the deterrent force, the less likely conflict and bloodshed will be. In the face of the uninformed masses who were temporarily unable to awaken and the blind passion stirred up by the turmoil for several dozen days, to gradually win over the masses and avoid injuring good people, it was necessary to maintain the maximum restraint and tolerance.

From May 20, most of the martial law troops were blocked in the suburbs of Beijing. Some were besieged for three to five days, while others were besieged for as long as a week. During these days, the soldiers could only stand on the vehicles, unable to eat, drink, or sleep. Supplies of food and water were difficult to obtain. Some small vendors took the opportunity to raise prices, selling a bottle of soda to a soldier for 10 yuan and an ice cream for 7 jiao. Some soldiers, after using the toilet, still had a few students following them. The soldiers were hungry, thirsty, and tired, with nosebleeds, diarrhea, and fever, even fainting... Many kind-hearted citizens shed tears, changing their attitudes and actively sending water and food, and nearby units also rushed to make large quantities of food and send it to the military vehicles.

A few thugs and hooligans mixed in the crowd, using all kinds of obscene language to insult the soldiers. Some people used loudspeakers to scream at the soldiers' ears, some physically assaulted the soldiers' dignity, and some indecent women performed obscene acts in front of the soldiers. Some even stood on the overpass and urinated and spat on the soldiers' heads... Our young soldiers were full of blood and could not tolerate the insult to their dignity. But for the needs of the martial law situation, they endured humiliation. Many soldiers, to control their indignant emotions, wrote the word "endure" on their bags and arms.

As early as the first day of martial law, the beating of soldiers and the destruction of military vehicles began. On the evening of May 20, a certain regiment was attacked by thugs near Princess Tomb when it arrived at the assembly point, injuring 7 officers and 12 soldiers. On the second day of martial law, in the Fengtai area, a certain regiment had 116 soldiers injured, 29 seriously injured, and one in critical condition. During this period, many commanders, with tears in their eyes, ordered the soldiers: "Do not retaliate when insulted, do not retaliate when beaten." A young soldier, when chased and beaten by thugs with stones, picked up a stone to prepare to retaliate, but was stopped by an officer on the spot, and he turned his face and cried in humiliation... In front of a martial law troop's camp, there was a couplet:

Drive away the Japanese, fight the Kuomintang, resist America, punish Vietnam, our old man, how can we not be firm?
Protect the capital, love the people, with guns, endure beatings, the soldiers, do not retaliate with a single punch.

The horizontal scroll reads: Awaken the people with blood.

It was during these days that some newspapers reported that Beijing had "good order." It was under this "good order" that Beijing was shrouded in absurd and bizarre political rumors, from campuses to streets, "the bells and drums are destroyed, the pots and pans are clanging," the thugs and "rebels" used all the vicious language from the "Cultural Revolution" such as "burning" and "frying" to curse the leaders of the Party, the state, and the military without restraint, wanting to overthrow whoever they wanted to overthrow. The once magnificent and magnificent Tiananmen Square was trampled into a "junk market and porridge stall," and Zhongnanhai was in chaos day and night, losing its dignity... The "guardians of the republic" were bleeding in their hearts!

The martial law troops did not enter the city for more than ten days, not because they lacked the ability. If it were a purely military operation, would there be any obstacles that could not be broken through? It was precisely because the people standing in front of us were mostly uninformed masses, and it was difficult to distinguish between good and bad people in the short term. The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission fully considered this, requiring the troops not to enter the city temporarily, to propagate the necessity of martial law and the purpose of the army to the people of Beijing, and to do good deeds for the masses as usual.

Where in the world is there such an army! Only our army, the people's children, can do this. Those who still think that the riot was caused by the martial law troops, in the face of the blood-stained spirit of the army, should their souls not be purified?

The arrow is on the string

The martial law troops' attitude of restraint and tolerance and their reasonable, advantageous, and restrained struggle strategy made a few conspirators extremely panicked. They were afraid that the longer the time was dragged out, the more people they would lose, and their evil conspiracy would ultimately fail. Therefore, they hurriedly planned to launch a counterrevolutionary riot. The basic strategy was to seize the opportunity to provoke conflicts between the masses and the martial law troops and create bloody incidents. They said that as long as Tiananmen Square shed blood, the country would be in chaos, and the government would collapse.

They prepared for both success and failure. For success, they drafted a list of members for the new government and listed the officials to be suppressed. If they failed, they would disperse, hide, and flee abroad, and for launching the counterrevolutionary riot, they made preparations in three aspects:

Public opinion preparation. They posted and distributed large and small wall posters and leaflets inciting armed riots, shouting "take up arms, overthrow the government," "not hesitating to sacrifice our heads and shed blood, clearly opposing the Communist Party and its government," "unite all forces, including the Kuomintang in Taiwan, to fight." One of the organizers, Liu Xiaobo, said on June 2, "We hope that Zhao Ziyang will return to power, and we must organize armed forces among the people."

Organizational preparation. The "High Autonomy Federation" and "Workers' Autonomy Federation" recruited a large number of thugs at high prices, forming various "suicide squads," "volunteer armies," and "Black Panther Strike Forces," intending to seize power in the manner of "kidnapping, abducting Party and state leaders, and storming the Bastille." They promised that each person participating in setting up roadblocks and blocking military vehicles could receive 30 yuan per day, burning a military vehicle would give 3,000 yuan, and capturing or killing a soldier would also give several thousand yuan.

Preparation of riot weapons and materials. They began to illegally purchase weapons, secretly stockpile guns, ammunition, and barrels of gasoline, and other riot tools, and made a large number of Molotov cocktails, wolf-tooth clubs, and daggers, and looted a large number of steel spikes and wooden sticks for large-scale smashing, looting, arson, and killing.

At the turn of May and June, a confrontation between revolution and counterrevolution was inevitable, and the situation was tense, ready to explode at any moment.

On the evening of June 2, a traffic accident occurred involving a jeep borrowed by the Central Television Station from the People's Armed Police. A few people took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that the martial law troops' advance car deliberately ran over students, inciting the uninformed to seize the corpse and parade with the coffin, igniting the riot.

At that time, some martial law troops, to avoid conflicts with the masses, continued to adopt the method of dispersing and entering multiple routes, wearing military summer uniforms or civilian clothes, and gradually entering important positions. From the evening of June 2, the troops entering the city were attacked by thugs, and by the afternoon of June 3, the counterrevolutionary riot had developed to a very serious extent. During this period, the crazy thugs smashed and burned military vehicles, beat and killed soldiers, and seized weapons and ammunition; some thugs began to attack the Great Hall of the People, the Propaganda Department, the Broadcasting Film and Television Department, Zhongnanhai, and other key national departments. They saw that the riot had started, and they further planned to use the opportunity that the next day was a Sunday to launch a larger-scale smashing, looting, arson, and killing, creating the situation of a popular uprising.

In the extremely urgent moment when the counterrevolutionary riot had already occurred, the originally planned martial law plan had to be changed. The Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission made a decisive decision, ordering the martial law troops around the capital to immediately suppress the counterrevolutionary riot. At 6:30 PM, the Beijing Municipal Government and the Martial Law Command issued an "Emergency Notice," requiring "all citizens to be vigilant, from now on, please do not go out, do not go to Tiananmen Square, ... to ensure your safety." This "Notice" was repeatedly broadcasted through television stations, radio stations, and martial law troop broadcast cars, and then, various martial law troops entered the city in more than ten routes.

The facts are clear: the martial law troops entered the city after the counterrevolutionary riot had already occurred, taking decisive action, and not "entering the city first, riot later."

To awaken the people with blood

"If I can awaken the people with blood, I am willing to shed all my blood; if I can awaken the people with my life, I am willing to die bravely." This is the oath of the martial law troops.

At this time, they were facing thugs who were armed with weapons and crazy, a test of life and death. They had to suppress the arrogance of the counterrevolutionary thugs and protect the uninformed masses; they had to clear the "source of turmoil" at Tiananmen Square and ensure that there would be no conflict with the tens of thousands of students who were coerced and incited onto the square. They were facing such a special struggle.

With the firm belief of defending the dignity of the constitution, defending the sacred People's Republic, and defending the solemn capital, they set out. Although before and after martial law, a few conspirators carried out a large number of subversion activities against the army, sending letters and telegrams to military units across the country, mailing reactionary propaganda materials, organizing "propaganda teams" to give non-stop speeches to the besieged martial law troops day and night, viciously inciting the army to "come over" or "remain neutral," all failed. Even their so-called "elite" had to admit, "the army is an impregnable fortress." Those who did propaganda on the front line said that the besieged martial law troops were "officers stubborn and soldiers silent." Our soldiers, without the elegant rhetoric of "equality, freedom, and love," always used their flesh and blood to defend the people's democracy, used their sacrifices to exchange for the people's peaceful and free labor life, and used their heroic deeds of rescue and self-sacrifice to express their love for the people. They had the red heart of loyalty to the Party, loyalty to the people, and loyalty to the People's Republic.

As soon as the troops set out, they were attacked by thugs. The "High Autonomy Federation" and "Workers' Autonomy Federation" had already set up positions on some high-rise buildings along the main roads to Tiananmen, organizing thugs to set up layer upon layer of roadblocks, and going through alleys and lanes to incite citizens to come out and watch and make trouble. The thugs mixed in the crowd, throwing Molotov cocktails, stones, and steel spikes, and using machetes, wolf-tooth clubs, and daggers to attack the disembarking officers and soldiers. Some thugs hid in high-rise buildings or bushes, using hunting rifles, small-caliber rifles, and homemade guns to shoot at the troops. Vehicle after vehicle was smashed and burned, soldier after soldier was killed and injured, and some wounded soldiers were still attacked by thugs on their way to the hospital. Some soldiers were kidnapped, and some weapons were looted...

As night fell, the troops' advance was still difficult, and the number of wounded increased, many of whom were shot. A staff officer was shot in the knee by a thug, and a company commander's arm was shot through... While the thugs became more and more rampant, they not only shot at the troops but also rushed forward to stab the driver's cabin with steel spikes, lift concrete blocks onto the vehicles, and even use homemade guns to shoot through the car windows. At this time, the troops still maintained high restraint and did not fire warning shots. A regiment, after being killed and injured by thugs more than 50 times, more than 30 soldiers surrounded the regiment commander and political commissar, and some even knelt down and begged, "These guys are too cruel, please order to retaliate!" The regiment commander and political commissar, with tears in their eyes, helped the soldiers up one by one, "We are the people's children, now good and bad people are mixed together, let us shed blood first!" A soldier named Yu Aimin, unable to defend himself and retaliate, was beaten blind in the right eye by thugs. He said, I do not blame the inciting crowd, I am willing to use my sacrifice to awaken the crowd!

However, after this, the thugs saw the troops' restraint and tolerance as weakness and bullying, becoming more and more unrestrained in their torture and killing of the troops, and the counterrevolutionary riot became more and more intense. To resolutely suppress the counterrevolutionary riot and avoid greater losses, some martial law troops, in the face of severe casualties, unbearable situations, and no more tolerance, and after all warnings were ineffective, had to reluctantly follow orders to fire warning shots. Later, for a few thugs who ignored the warning shots and continued to kill soldiers, the troops had to retaliate. Some people say that it was the martial law troops who fired warning shots first, and the thugs who committed crimes later. Can the iron facts be arbitrarily altered?

During this period, due to the large number of onlookers, some were crushed by various vehicles, some were trampled by the crowd, and some were injured or killed by armed thugs; some were also injured or killed by stray bullets. Although some people did not listen to the requirements of the "Emergency Notice" and insisted on going out to watch, being injured or killed was still very regrettable.

At 1:30 AM on June 4, the troops began to enter Tiananmen Square. After more than three hours of repeated broadcasts, they advised those remaining on the square to leave quickly. At 5:30 AM, the clearing task was completed, and not a single person was killed among those who were sitting on the square, including those who were forcibly removed. Thus, the counterrevolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing was crushed in one fell swoop.

In the suppression of the counterrevolutionary riot, thousands of martial law troops from generals to soldiers were injured, and dozens of soldiers were killed. The vicious and brutal counterrevolutionaries not only killed our children but also poured gasoline on them to burn their bodies, left them to rot in the streets, and even disemboweled them! They vented their extreme hatred of the Party, the people, and the People's Republic on the bodies of the martyrs. The "guardians of the republic," they also had weapons in their hands, but to avoid injuring the masses, they gave up their right to self-defense. It was with such a heroic sacrifice that they expressed the soldiers' love for the people and hatred for the enemy; they fulfilled their oath: to awaken millions of people with the young lives and blood.

Our children, they did not complain about the onlookers who hindered the troops from attacking the thugs. They were grateful to the people who rescued them. An 18-year-old soldier, Chen Zhigang, was severely injured by thugs and wrote a will with great difficulty after regaining consciousness:

"Parents:

This is a critical moment of life and death. The uncles, aunts, and grandmothers from the China Bookstore saved me with all their might. If I am no more, please do not be sad, take care of yourselves, your son died for the country, sacrificed for the people, and died with no regrets. There is only one condition, please, no matter what, thank these benefactors..."

Those who, after the soldiers were brutally killed, still wanted to pour the filth of "killing old ladies and female college students" on them, in the presence of the spirits of the martyrs, do your souls not tremble?

Reflecting on the past to guide the future – The blood of the "guardians of the republic" will not be in vain

As the foundation of the state, the four cardinal principles must be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people and must be consistently propagated and educated as the main theme of political thought. History has proven that for a country as large as China, there is no other choice but the four cardinal principles to unite and concentrate the thoughts, will, and actions of the entire nation. In the past few years, the education of the four cardinal principles has not been consistently carried out, resulting in a scattered public sentiment. This lesson should be seriously learned. Of course, to make political and ideological education more deeply rooted in people's hearts and to forge a more united and powerful spiritual pillar, we must abandon simple and rigid, and metaphysical things, and create new experiences and methods under new historical conditions.

This turmoil, with so many people incited by a few conspirators, was both unexpected and understandable. Social stability has never been a natural accompaniment to economic development. On the contrary, economic development has always fallen short of people's expectations. In the process of reform and opening-up, full of difficulties and twists and turns, the greatest satisfaction of the masses is that the Party can continue to share weal and woe with the people. Therefore, acts of seeking personal gain and breaking the law often become the most sensitive and detested issues. The serious corruption among some Party members and cadres, especially a few leading cadres, has made people lose trust in the Party and the government. If the Party and the government cannot correct themselves in time, people's "dissatisfaction" will be vented through various opportunities, triggering social instability. This is also an important reason why many people were drawn into this turmoil. The Party is aware of this. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee has clearly proposed to take practical actions to combat corruption and do a few things that will make the hearts of the Party and the people rejoice. Every Party member and every cadre must not stop at lip service in combating corruption. This is not just about ensuring that individuals or their children do not make mistakes but is a matter of life and death for the Party.

A long-term stable society is always built on a sound legal system. Today's China, democratic and legal construction must complement each other, but in the reality of an imperfect legal system and the widespread phenomenon of "laws not being enforced," strengthening legal construction is particularly important. This is not about putting a "tight rein" on democracy and freedom, but rather, it is to more effectively ensure that officials at all levels are under the effective supervision of the people, to ensure that citizens enjoy broader democracy and freedom within the scope that does not harm national and individual interests. We must avoid disasters like the "Cultural Revolution" and prevent the repetition of this tragedy by using the method of strengthening the legal system to regulate and constrain social life, and must establish the concept of national security and stability above all else in the entire population. This is a fundamental measure, a profound enlightenment after this turmoil.

Theoretical ambiguity inevitably leads to confusion in thought and action. In recent years, some people promoting bourgeois liberalization have distorted many theoretical right and wrong issues by talking about reform, and the poison has spread widely, while we lack a powerful theoretical resistance and clarification. Therefore, on some fundamental and major theoretical issues, the entire Party's understanding must be unified. For example: when exploring the system model and operating mechanism, the fundamental principles of socialism must not be ignored; economic reform emphasizes the development of various ownership components, but the thousands of state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises must not be ignored as the basic force and core part of China's modernization; when emphasizing the role of entrepreneurs or managers, the master position of the working class must not be ignored; promoting the concept of commodity economy in a general and one-sided manner will weaken the construction of spiritual civilization and ideological and political work, etc. Our theoretical workers have a heavy responsibility!

The loss of national spirit is particularly evident in some young people involved in the turmoil. In recent years, the backward and decadent things brought in by opening up to the outside world, coupled with the long-term lack of consistent opposition to bourgeois liberalization, have fostered a blind admiration for foreigners and a self-deprecating attitude among some young people. This sentiment makes some young people place the future and hope of the country on the capitalist system of the West, rather than linking the destiny and future of the motherland with the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. This is very dangerous. The challenges faced by any developing country in the world today are not only from the new technological revolution but also from the challenge of national spirit. Blindly admiring foreigners will only result in being at the mercy of others. Strengthening patriotism education and promoting national spirit is the only way for socialist China to develop into a truly modernized and powerful country. Every young person who aspires to rejuvenate China should make a choice worthy of the times on this issue.

In summary, let us all reflect on the past and look to the future. The blood of the "guardians of the republic" will not be in vain, and the development of socialist China is full of hope for victory.

    平暴“备忘录”
    ——兼答“戒严部队不入城是否会发生反革命暴乱”等疑问
    解犀　施路
    1　写在开篇的结论
    从4月中旬的学潮到反革命暴乱基本平息，整个过程差不多经历了两个月的时间。这惊心动魄的两个月，事态的发展起伏跌宕，许许多多的人经历了感情上的春夏秋冬和灵魂上血与火的洗礼。人民解放军在这场特殊而严峻的政治斗争中“考试合格”，用鲜血和生命捍卫了党的领导和社会主义制度，年轻的共和国又一次将捍卫主权、粉碎颠覆的伟大胜利载入史册。
    这场风波迟早要来，这是国际大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是不以人的意志为转移的。邓小平同志的这个论断，高瞻远瞩，精辟地阐明了这场斗争的必然性。
    如同观察一座山脉，必须站到山巅之上才能看清它的走向；认识复杂的历史事件，也应尽量站到时代所能给予的高度，才能洞悉它产生和发展的必然趋势。
    暴乱平息至今，不少人有时还作种种设想，如：北京不戒严或戒严部队不入城，是否会发生反革命暴乱？有人甚至还提出“北京戒严在前，动乱在后，军队进城在前、暴乱在后”这种倒因为果的责难，等等。善良的人们，或是一时难以接受如此严酷的事实，或是作为旁观者不了解事态的全部真相，产生一些疑问是可以理解的；也有一些人陷得比较深，思想感情一时转不过弯来，想找出某些理由，或平衡自己矛盾的心理，或为自己的过失辩护，这尚在情理之中。看来，我们要获得正确的共识，很需要超越自身的局限，抛弃个人的恩怨，站到维护国家利益与安全的高度，拓展观察整个事态演变的视野，以得出对这场斗争必然性的明智判断。至于极少数别有用心的人，提出种种责难来混淆视听，事实将作出严正的驳斥。
    2　从杜勒斯的预言到“美国之
        音”的谣言
    对50年代美国国务卿杜勒斯要把和平演变的希望寄托在中国党的第三代第四代身上的预言，现在20多岁的年青人是陌生的。进入80年代后，和平与发展逐渐成为当今世界的主题，多年的和平生活，使许多人对这种“和平演变”的危险丧失了警觉。事实上，近十年来，国际资本主义的反动势力认为，利用社会主义国家的暂时困难和改革开放，是实行“不战而胜”、“和平演变”战略的最佳时机，因而加紧进行政治、思想上的渗透和从内部的颠覆。
    他们以“民主、自由、人权”为旗号，兜售资本主义的议会制和多党制。他们利用国际共产主义运动出现的曲折，大肆宣传“共产主义已经死亡”，提出要鼓励“社会主义国家的自由化趋势”，支持“一切削弱共产党领导的工潮、学潮和民族纠纷”，对“持不同政见者”进行政治庇护，大力扶植“反对派”。
    他们利用我国扩大开放的时机，通过各种传播媒介，宣扬资本主义的个人主义价值观念和腐朽没落的生活方式，以求在思想文化观念上实行“软着陆”，腐蚀共产主义的精神支柱。
    而“美国之音”在近一个时期内的反华表演达到了利令智昏的程度。又是延长对华广播时间，又是增加播放频率，大肆造谣惑众，煽风点火，把颠覆社会主义制度的企图和希望破灭后气急败坏的嘴脸暴露无遗。可以说，没有“美国之音”等国际反动势力喉舌的鼓噪和支持，这场动乱和反革命暴乱是不会发展到如此严重地步的；以美国为代表的西方资本主义国家的推波助澜，是事态急剧恶化的重要外部原因。
    3　从“军事反攻”到“政治登陆”
    中华人民共和国成立40年来，台湾国民党当局一直梦想反攻大陆。随着国际形势的变化和社会主义制度的巩固，“军事反攻”势已难成，他们不顾各界爱国人士要求祖国统一的呼声，逐步将策略转向所谓的“政治登陆”，搞“柔性攻势”，从未放弃有计划、有组织的心战策反活动。
    近一个时期，他们配合国际上利用所谓“民主自由运动”掀起的反华浪潮，以及大陆资产阶级自由化的思潮，加快了“政治登陆”的步伐。特别是去年以来，台、港反动势力大肆鼓吹要“使大陆早日民主化与自由化”，把攻击的矛头直接指向老一辈革命家，攻击中国共产党的领导，攻击社会主义制度，宣扬所谓的“台湾经验”，企图影响大陆使其向有利于“自由化”的方向发展。
    4、5月份，国民党中常会、“行政院”多次召开会议讨论大陆学潮，提出“要更积极、更主动地支持大陆的自由民主运动”。国民党的宣传机器也开足马力，进行声势浩大的造谣、诬谄和煽动。
    在这场闹剧中，“国安会”某要人发起了“送爱心到天安门”的活动，带头捐款10万新台币，并由“经济部”投资处设立“支援大陆民主运动基金”。一些台、港以及美、英等不明身份的人，携带巨款潜入北京，为“高自联”、“工自联”提供资助，让这些非法组织收买暴徒，去烧军车、抢夺武器、绑架残害军人。
    而台湾“大陆工作指导小组”则认为，目前是进行“政治登陆”千载难逢的机会，派遣大量特务到大陆进行活动，直接插手动乱和暴乱。台特机关指令在各地的特务，“这次共产党真要垮台了”，要“配合区内形势，秘密策动学潮”。
    台、港反动势力以及“中国民主联盟”等在国外的非法政治组织，与极少数长期顽固坚持自由化立场的人、向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人，早就建立了一种微妙的联系。当形势不利时，他们的呼应或明或暗，有如鬼火高低明灭；当形势有利时，他们就明目张胆地勾结在一起，狼狈为奸。在这次学潮、动乱和暴乱中，他们就配合得相当默契。这是许多善良的人们所想象不到的。
    4　从“北京之春”到
        “北京暴乱”
    资产阶级自由化思潮始于“文化大革命”结束之后不久。发展至今，差不多有三次高潮。坚持四项基本原则和搞资产阶级自由化始终是斗争的焦点。
    第一次是1979年的所谓“北京之春”运动。那时候，“高自联”的头头们还只是10岁左右的娃娃。当时党正领导人民进行拨乱反正。一些人借解放思想，打着“民主、人权”的幌子，利用党在“文革”中的挫折，利用林彪、“四人帮”时期遗留下来的一些社会问题，同台、港以及国外政治势力相勾结，采用“文革”中“大民主”的方式，鼓动闹事，鼓吹“万恶之源是无产阶级专政”，“要坚决彻底批判中国共产党”。他们认为中国现在不是搞四个现代化的问题，而是应该搞资本主义式的社会改革。为了防止正要展开的改革开放大业偏离正确方向，邓小平同志旗帜鲜明地提出了要坚持四项基本原则，击退了这股逆流。
    第二次出现在1986年底。与上次不同的是，经历了八五、八六年两次学潮，搞自由化的人推出了方励之、王若望、刘宾雁等头面人物，明确地提出了反对共产党的领导、反对社会主义道路的口号，主张“全盘西化”，把资本主义制度搬到中国来。由于鼓动自由化思潮的是一些名人。在青年学生中具有很大的欺骗性和煽动性，党组织坚决把这几个头面人物开除出党。邓小平同志又一次郑重地告诫全党，在改革开放中要加强四项基本原则的教育，旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。
    这一次可谓是登峰造极。极少数人早在去年年底就开始了酝酿和策划。他们提出，要接受历次“民主运动”的教训，“一定要有组织，有计划，有纲领地进行”，“要广泛获得国际社会的同情和支持，”“要发动社会各界形成对政府的集团压力”，
  “要干到底，决不能半途而废”。
    ——他们通过所谓的“民主沙龙”、“自由论坛”以及各式各样的报告会、研讨会，高校内外的大、小字报和演讲，港台报刊，大造思想舆论。根本的口号仍然是两个：打倒共产党，推翻社会主义制度。并形成了反对四项基本原则的一套比较系统的理论观点，比如：“社会主义是个病，私有化、民营化是唯一出路”；“共产党领导是民主政治的障碍”；“从结社自由到新的政党领导，民主具有世界共同性”；“马克思主义在中国已经死亡”，“要彻底否定毛泽东思想”；“改革的目标是走向如美国、西欧、日本这些公认的发达社会”，等等。他们四处兜售的这些政治主张，许多都是赤裸裸的表白；也有一些是打着改革理论探索的旗号以售其奸。不难看出，他们的最终目的就是要建立一个完全西方附庸化的资产阶级共和国。
    ——他们从前两次“失败”中得出一个教训：单靠“北京之春”运动中那样几个“西单墙分子”、“二次高潮”中那样几个头面人物出面去鼓噪学生，成不了大气候，也容易为群众识破。这一次，方励之等长期顽固坚持自由化立场的人、同海外国外敌对势力相勾结的人、向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人，沆瀣一气，纠合在一起，组成所谓“运动中坚”，其中一些人，已是自由化运动的“三朝元老”，可谓老谋深算。他们组织策划于幕后，而极其阴险地把学生推到前台，甚至不惜把学生作为人质，煽动群众同党和政府的对立情绪。
    ——他们密授学潮的头头：“先要搞臭团委、学生会，这样政府就没帮手了”；“如果各地高校都成立联合组织，一下子就可以把全国学联替代了。在共产党体制下建立第一个自发的学生联合组织，将对整个中国的政局有很大影响。折腾起来，一下子就是百万大军”。他们的目的很明确，就是想通过这次活动建立反对党，长期进行斗争。4月26日，“北京高校学生自治联合会”（即“高自联”）正式成立。起初叫“团结学生会”，想搞成同波兰团结工会一样，后觉得这个名字把建立反对党的意图暴露得太明显，又改成了“高自联”。此后，北京和全国各地相继出现了一大批非法组织。
    ——4月21日，正是动乱初步形成的时候，北大、人大贴出一张题为《原来是个阴谋》的揭露材料，署名“北大一醒者”。其中说：“一位行动的中坚人物说，新华门前最来情绪的就是拱起警察的火，只要警察一动手，就有借口把事情扩大。”“原来行动早有安排。第一步借悼念胡耀邦，顺便提出政治要求。李
  （淑娴）老师说，要把为胡平反放在第一位，这样政府就不好说什么了。第二条要求也别提为自由化受挫的人平反，那样太脱离群众，也易引起误会，为方（励之）老师平反要藏在背后。再有，群众恨腐败，就用这一点攻他们。第二步，到新华门静坐，必要时往里挤，只要警察敢管，就是打人，这样才能唤起同学的同情心，特别是女同学。第三步，要求参加追悼会，很多人有这种心理，这样事情就更大了，还能推向全国。”这位醒悟的学生一开头就说：“我昨天经历了一段痛苦的思索，还是以我的良心为重，依据事实把真相告诉大家，为了我们别再做阴谋家的牺牲品”。可惜，当时这样的“醒者”太少了！从揭露的大量事实看，从学潮到动乱，直至暴乱的猝发，无不是在阴谋家的精心导演之下。他们就是以这样阴险的手段，把反动的政治纲领付诸行动的。从以上可以看出，他们这一次是横下一条心，不达目的绝不罢休的。
    5　“旗帜鲜明”与“旗帜不鲜明”
    领导中国人民翻身解放和创立改革开放大业的老一辈革命家，对人民共和国被颠覆的危险始终保持着高度的警惕，时刻维护着人民共和国的主权。邓小平同志在党的十二大上郑重宣告：“任何外国不要指望中国做他们的附庸，不要指望中国会吞下损害我国利益的苦果”。对附庸于国际反动潮流的国内自由化思潮，以邓小平为代表的老一辈革命家，始终旗帜鲜明地坚决抵制，防止酿成政治动乱。
    早在十年前，邓小平同志就提醒全党，决不能低估那些搞政治阴谋的人，那些所谓“民主自由派”，那些无政府主义分子和极端个人主义分子等等，“尽管这几种人的性质不同，但是在一定的情况下，他们完全可以纠合在一起，成为一股破坏势力，可以造成不小的动乱和损失。这种情况去年就发生过，今后还可能发生。”近几年，他反复告诫全党：反对资产阶级自由化不仅现在要讲，而且要长期讲，整个现代化过程都存在一个反对自由化的问题。对如何防止自由化思潮的泛滥和由此产生的恶果，他反复强调，“领导要旗帜鲜明，群众才能擦亮眼睛”，“凡是闹得起来的地方，都是因为那里的领导态度不坚决，旗帜不鲜明”。
    但是，许多年来，在我们党内，这些重要的思想和方针没有能够始终得到很好贯彻；一些领导人对坚持四项基本原则旗帜不鲜明，没有把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争一贯到底。1986年学生闹事，就是反对自由化旗帜不鲜明、态度不坚决的结果。当时的总书记胡耀邦同志在这个问题上有重大失误。这次风波的产生，也是由于赵紫阳同志担任总书记以后，没有把反对自由化的斗争始终如一地贯彻下去，消极地对待坚持四项基本原则，怂恿助长了自由化思潮的泛滥，酿成了极为严重的后果。
    当资本主义世界渡过战后危机，重新获得科学技术和生产的迅速发展时，一些人感到意外而产生困惑；同时，社会主义在发展过程中遇到了曲折，使自身的优越性未能充分发挥出来，影响到它在人们心目中的形象。改革开放给社会主义带来新的生机，经过“十年内乱”，深感我国经济、文化落后的人民群众对发展和改革的愿望比任何时候都更为强烈。对此，如果领导者的头脑不清醒，在坚持经济建设为中心、加速改革开放的同时，不旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，放松精神文明建设和思想政治工作，不仅社会生产力发展不起来，而且会导致党的凝聚力的削弱，造成社会动荡，这就难免犯历史性的错误，给国家和人民带来巨大的灾难。6　如果……
    纵观国际大气候和国内小气候，我们再回过头来看这场风波的产生，就不会感到奇怪了。它是国际资本主义的反动势力长期对我国进行渗透和颠覆，是国内资产阶级自由化思潮长期泛滥并与国际反华潮流相勾联，是我们党内一些人与自由化思潮产生共鸣、党的某些领导人坚持四项基本原则不一贯的必然结果。这决不是一件孤立的、偶发性事件。绝不是善良人所想象的“通过对话、双方让步、给台阶就可以解决的”，更不是“政府措施不当逼出来的”，而是大小气候遥相呼应、蓄意已久、迟早必然要发生的，是不以人的意志为转移的。
    当人们对一个历史事件发生的必然性还缺乏深刻认识的时候，往往会提出多种假设。暴乱平息后，许多人围绕事态的演变和结局，在反思时头脑里就难免出现了许多“如果”。
    任何一个复杂的历史事件，都包含必然性和偶然性的因素。必然性的因素决定了事物的不可逆转的发展趋势；而偶然性因素则通过事物发展具体进程表现其必然性。
    如果胡耀邦同志不是在4月15日逝世，那么风波也会在纪念“五四”运动70周年、法国大革命200周年等时机被挑起。
    如果在学生绝食时政府以对话的方式答应他们的政治条件，否定“4·26”社论，承认他们的非法组织，他们也不会善罢甘休，也仍然会以其他借口继续制造事端，扩大事态；也仍然会在非法组织合法化后，进而建立反对党，进行长期斗争。
    如果5月20日不采取对北京部分地区实行戒严的措施，6月3日戒严部队不强行入城，他们还是要继续使动乱和暴乱升级，进而扩大到全国，逼迫政府下台，或以所谓“攻打巴士底狱”的方式推翻社会主义共和国。
    同样，如果6月2日晚，中央电视台借用了10个月的武警部队的吉普车不是发生一起交通事故，他们也会寻找别的借口发动反革命暴乱。这种卑劣的伎俩，在60多天里，人们领教得还少吗？
    这类偶然性的“如果”是很多的。无论怎样“如果”，都无法摆脱必然性的制约。
    从这场风波的起因看，有这样一种必然性的“如果”，那就是：如果党和政府再作退让，不果断地动用国家机器强制恢复秩序，那么我们就将要付出更高的代价，十年改革的巨大成果就要毁于一旦，人民共和国就可能被葬送。
    7　炼狱中的军魂
      “委屈是比死更难受的刑罚。……这是何等残酷的精神折磨呀！如果没有一颗爱人民的心灵，无论如何也是做不到这一点的。因此，我可以说，伟大的中国军人啊，你们在这一点上创造了整个人类的奇迹。”——《辽宁日报》一记者
    本来，人民日报发表4·26社论到“五·四”前，事态有所缓和。赵紫阳同志的“五·四”讲话，是动乱升级的转折点。北京越来越陷入严重的无政府状态。北京的动乱不断向全国蔓延。在北京治安系统力量不足、行政手段解决问题无效的情况下，在面临全国大乱的危急时刻，迅速稳定首都的局势已成为稳定全国的关键。
    党和政府迫不得已，决定按照宪法的规定由国务院下令对北京部分地区实行戒严。戒严令还未公布，极少数掌握党和国家核心机密的人就向非法组织通风报信。动乱的组织者马上改绝食为静坐，大肆散布政治谣言，组织收买歹徒，煽动不明真相的群众到处设置路障，拦堵军车，加剧了动乱。由此可见，所谓“戒严在前、动乱在后”的说法纯属无稽之谈。
    处理如此阵线不清、矛盾交织的复杂情况，要最大限度地避免冲突和流血，就要有足够的威慑力量。威慑力量越大，冲突和流血的可能性就越少。而在不明真相的群众一时难以醒悟、几十天动乱所鼓噪起的盲目激情一时难以平静的情况下，为了逐步争取群众、避免误伤好人，就必须最大限度地保持克制和忍让。
    从5月20日起，各路戒严部队大都在北京郊区受阻。有的被围堵三五天，有的长达一周。在这些日子里，官兵们只能站在车上，吃不上饭，喝不上水，睡不成觉。部队食品难以供应，饮水难以补充。有的小商小贩乘机抬高物价，卖给战士一瓶汽水要十元钱，一根冰棍要7角钱。有的战士上厕所后面还有几个学生跟着。官兵们饿了、渴了、困了，口鼻流血，腹泻发烧，甚至晕倒了……许多善良的市民流泪了，他们转变了态度，主动送水送饭，附近的地方单位也赶制了大批食品送上军车。
    少数流氓、地痞混杂在人群中，用种种不堪入耳的下流语言辱骂战士。有的人用电喇叭对着战士的耳朵狂叫，有的动手动脚侮辱战士的人格，还有一些不三不四的女人在官兵面前做下流动作，还有人甚至站在立交桥上向战士头上撒尿、吐痰……我们的年轻战士血气方刚，难容人格侮辱。但他们为了戒严大局的需要，忍辱负重。许多战士为了控制自己激愤的情绪，在挎包上、胳膊上写下了一个个醒目的“忍”字。
    早在戒严第一天，殴打官兵、破坏军车的暴行就开始了。5月20日晚，某师在公主坟附近进驻集合点时就被歹徒打伤军官7名、战士12名。戒严第二天，在丰台一带，某师被打伤官兵达116人，重伤29人，一人生命垂危。这段时间，许多指挥员含着眼泪命令战士：骂不还口，打不还手。有一个小战士，在歹徒用石块追打他时，捡起石头准备回打，被干部当场制止，他转过脸委屈地哭了……一支戒严部队驻地前贴着这样一副对联：
    驱日寇打蒋匪抗美惩越老子我何坚不摧
    卫首都爱人民荷枪挨打子弟兵一拳不还
    横批是：以血醒民
    正是在这几天，有的报刊还报道北京有“良好的秩序”。正是在这种“良好的秩序”下，北京被荒诞离奇的政治谣言所笼罩，从院校到街头，“黄钟毁弃，瓦釜雷鸣”，歹徒和“造反派”们用尽“文革”中“火烧”、“油煎”等等恶毒语言肆无忌惮地咒骂党、国家和军队的领导人，想打倒谁就打倒谁；昔日雄伟壮丽的天安门广场被糟踏成了“破烂市粥棚”，新华门前昼夜喧嚣，失去了仪门之威……“共和国卫士”们心里在流血！
    戒严部队十多天没有入城，决不是没有能力。如果是单纯的军事行动，哪有突不破的障碍？就是因为站在我们面前的大多是不明真相的群众，好人和坏人一时难以分清。党中央、国务院、中央军委充分考虑到这一点，要求部队暂不入城，向北京市民宣传戒严的必要性和我军宗旨，像往常一样尽力多为群众做好事。
    世界上哪有这样的军队！只有我们的军队——人民的子弟兵才能这样做。那些至今还认为暴乱是戒严部队引起的人，在这丹心如血的军魂面前，心灵难道不应得一些净化吗？
    8　箭在弦上
    戒严部队克制忍让的态度和有理有利有节的斗争策略，使极少数搞阴谋的人感到万分恐慌。他们害怕拖延的时间越长，失去的群众越多，罪恶阴谋终难得逞。因此他们加紧策划发动反革命暴乱。基本策略是寻机挑起群众与戒严部队的冲突，制造流血事件。他们说，只要天安门广场一流血，全国就会大乱，政府就要垮台。
    他们为成功和失败作了准备。为成功拟定了新政府的组成人员名单，列出了要镇压的干部。如失败，他们就分散隐蔽、逃亡国外，并为发动反革命暴乱进行了三个方面的准备：
    舆论准备。他们张贴、散发煽动武装暴乱的大小字报和传单，叫嚣“要拿起武器，推翻政府”，“不惜抛头颅、洒热血，旗帜鲜明地反对共产党和他的政府”，“团结包括台湾国民党在内的各种力量进行斗争。”组织策划者之一的刘晓波6月2日说，“期望赵紫阳复出，我们就必须在人民中组织武装部队。”
    组织准备。“高自联”、“工自联”许下高价收买了一大批暴徒，组成各种“敢死队”、“义勇军”、“黑豹突击队”，要用“软禁、绑架党和国家领导人、攻打巴士底狱的方式”夺取政权。他们许诺每个参加设路障、堵军车的人每天都可以得到30元的报酬，烧一辆军车给3000元，抓住或打死一个军人也给几千元。
    暴乱武器、物资的准备。他们开始非法采购武器，秘密储备枪枝弹药及成桶的汽油等暴乱工具，自制了大批燃烧瓶、狼牙棒、匕首等凶器，并抢劫了大批钢钎、木棒，以供大规模的打砸抢烧杀之用。
    五六月之交，一场革命与反革命的必然较量，已是箭在弦上，一触即发。
    6月2日晚，中央电视台借用武警部队的一辆吉普车发生一起交通事故。极少数人借机大造谣言，说戒严部队开道车故意轧死学生，鼓动不明真相的人抢夺尸体、抬棺大游行，点燃了暴乱之火。
    当时，部分戒严部队为避免与群众的冲突，正继续采取分散多路方式，着军夏装或便装陆续进入重要警戒位置。从6月2日晚开始，进城指战员遭到了暴徒的疯狂袭击，至3日下午，反革命暴乱已发展到很严重的程度。在这期间，疯狂的暴徒见军车就砸、就烧，见军人就打，并抢夺武器弹药；一些暴徒开始冲击人民大会堂、中宣部、广播电影电视部、中南海等国家要害部门。他们见暴乱已经发起，又进一步策划利用第二天是星期日的时机，发动更大规模的打砸抢冲烧杀，造成群众暴动的态势。
    在反革命暴乱已经发生的万分紧急时刻，原定戒严方案不得不被迫改变。中共中央、国务院、中央军委果断作出决定，命令在首都周围的戒严部队，立即平息反革命暴乱。下午6时半，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部发出《紧急通告》，要求“全体市民要提高警惕，从现在起，请你们不要上街去，不要到天安门广场去，……以保证你们的生命安全。”这个《通告》，通过电视台、电台和戒严部队广播车进行了反复广播，尔后，各戒严部队分十几路向市区开进。
    事实很清楚，戒严部队进城是在反革命暴乱已经发生之后采取的果断行动，决不是什么“进城在前，暴乱在后。”
    9　慷慨赴死以血醒民
    “如果能以血醒民，我愿把血流干；如果能以命醒民，我愿慷慨赴死。”这就是戒严部队官兵的誓言。
    此时，他们面对的已经是手持凶器、丧心病狂的暴徒，是一场生死考验。既要打击反革命暴徒的嚣张气焰，又要保护不明真相的群众；既要清理天安门广场这个“动乱源”，又要保证不与被煽动和胁迫在广场上成千上万的学生发生冲突。他们面临的是这样一场特殊的斗争。
    他们怀着捍卫宪法尊严、捍卫神圣的人民共和国、捍卫庄严的首都的坚定信念出发了。尽管戒严前后，极少数搞阴谋的人对军队进行了大量的策反活动，又是向各地驻军单位致信致电，邮寄反动宣传品，又是组织“宣传队”向被堵截的戒严部队昼夜不停地蛊惑演讲，恶毒地煽动军队“站过来”或“保持中立”，但统统都失败了。连他们的所谓“精英人物”们也不得不承认，“军队是攻不破的堡垒”。在第一线做蛊惑宣传的人，称被围困的戒严部队是“军官顽固不化，士兵一言不发”。我们士兵，没有满嘴“平等、自由、博爱”的华丽词藻，他们总是用自己的血肉之躯捍卫着人民的民主，用自己的牺牲去换取人民和平自由的劳动生活，用抢险救灾、舍生忘死的壮举去表达对人民的爱。他们有的是忠于党、忠于人民、忠于人民共和国的赤子丹心。
    部队刚刚出发，就遭到了暴徒的疯狂袭击。“高自联”、“工自联”已经在通向天安门的一些主要路段的高层建筑上设点，组织暴徒设置重重路障，并串大街走小巷煽动市民出来围观、起哄。暴徒们混在人群中，投掷燃烧瓶、石块和钢钎，对下车护卫的官兵用砍刀、狼牙棒、匕首等凶器疯狂施暴，还有一些暴徒躲在高层建筑上或树丛中，用猎枪、小口径步枪和土制火枪向部队射击。一辆辆军车被砸、被烧，一个个官兵被杀伤、倒下，一些伤员在送往医院的途中仍遭暴徒的残害，一些官兵被绑架，一些武器被抢劫……
    入夜，部队前进仍很困难，伤员大量增多，许多是受了枪伤。一名参谋被暴徒用枪打伤了膝盖，一名连长胳膊被子弹打穿……而暴徒越来越猖獗，他们不仅开枪射击，还冲上前去用钢钎往驾驶室里戳，抬起水泥墩往车上砸，甚至用火枪伸进车窗里打。此时，部队仍以高度的克制，没有鸣枪。有一个团在被暴徒杀伤50多人的情况下，30多名战士围着团长政委，有的还跪了下来请求说，“这帮家伙太残忍了，快下命令还击吧！”团长政委含着眼泪把战士一个个扶起来，“我们是人民的子弟兵，现在好人坏人混在一起，宁可我们自己流血！”一个叫余爱民的战士因无法自卫还击被暴徒打瞎了右眼，他说，我不怪起哄的群众，我愿用自己的牺牲换来群众的觉醒！
    可是，在这之后，暴徒们视部队的克制忍让为软弱可欺，更加肆无忌惮地摧残、杀害部队官兵，反革命暴乱愈演愈烈。为了坚决平息反革命暴乱，避免更大的损失，一些戒严部队在伤亡严重、忍无可忍、让无可让、一切警告均无效的情况下，迫不得已奉命对空鸣枪开道。尔后，对少数不顾对空鸣枪警告、仍然残杀军人的暴徒，部队不得不予以反击。有人说，是戒严部队鸣枪在前，暴徒行凶在后，铁的事实难道可以任意篡改吗！
    在此期间，由于围观的人多，有的被各种车辆撞挤，有的被人群冲撞，而造成伤亡；还有的被持枪暴徒打伤打死；也有一些被流弹误伤误亡。尽管一些人不听《紧急通告》的要求，执意上街围观，但被误伤误亡，仍是令人十分痛惜的。
    4日凌晨一时半，部队开始进入天安门广场。经反复三个多小时的广播，劝告留在广场的人尽快离开。5时半，清场任务完成，在广场静坐的学生、包括最后被强制离开的，没有死一个人。至此，北京发生的反革命暴乱被一举粉碎。
    在平息反革命暴乱中，戒严部队从将军到士兵几千人负伤，几十名官兵牺牲。凶恶残暴的反革命分子是那样地屠杀我们的子弟兵，活活打死还不够，还要浇上汽油焚尸，还要暴尸街头，还要剖腹掏肠！他们把对党对人民对人民共和国的极端仇恨发泄在烈士身上。“共和国卫士”们，他们有的手里也有武器，但为了避免误伤群众，放弃了开枪自卫的正当权利。他们正是以如此壮烈的牺牲表达了战士对人民的爱、对敌人的恨；实现了自己的誓言：用年轻的生命和热血唤醒千万人。
    我们的子弟兵，对妨碍了部队打击暴徒的围观群众，没有抱怨。他们对抢救了自己的群众感激不尽。18岁的战士陈志强被暴徒打成重伤，昏迷醒来后艰难地写下了一份遗书：
      “父母：
    这是生死存亡的紧急关头，中国书店的叔叔、伯伯、婶婶、大娘、大姐拚命相救。如果我不行了，请不要悲伤，多保重，儿为国捐躯，为民献身，死而无憾。只有一个条件，求你们无论怎样也要感谢这些恩人……”
    那些在战士惨遭杀害后，还要把“打死老太太，女大学生”的污水泼在他们身上的人，在烈士的英灵面前，你们的灵魂难道不发抖吗？
      10　思索过去告诉未来——
    “共和国卫士”的血不会白流
    ——作为立国之本的四项基本原则，要深深植根于人民的心中，必须始终如一地把它作为政治思想的主题来进行灌输和教育。历史证明，对于中国这样一个大国，能够把全民族的思想意志和行动统一起来、凝聚起来，除了四项基本原则以外，别无任何选择。在过去几年，四项基本原则的教育未能一贯到底，造成了人心涣散。这种教训应当认真吸取。当然，政治思想教育要能更加深入人心，锻铸也更为统一、强大的精神支柱，必须抛弃简单生硬和形而上学的东西，在新的历史条件下创造出新的经验和做法。
    ——这次动乱这么多人被极少数阴谋分子煽动起来，既出乎意料，又不难理解。社会稳定从来就不是经济发展的自然伴随物。相反，经济发展始终赶不上人们的期望值。在充满了困难和曲折的改革开放过程中，群众最大的满足就是党能一如既往地与人民同甘共苦。于是，以权谋私、知法犯法等腐败行为往往就成了人们最敏感、最厌恶的问题。一些党员干部、特别是极少数领导干部中存在的严重腐败现象，使人们对党和政府产生了一种不信任感。如果党和政府不能及时匡正自身，人们的“不满足情绪”就会通过各种机会渲泄出来，触发社会的不稳定。这也是这次风波中很多人被裹挟进去的一个重要原因。对这一点，党是清醒的。十三届四中全会已明确提出要拿出惩治腐败的实际行动来，办几件使党心民心为之振奋的事情。每个党员、每位干部对清除腐败都不能停留在口头上，这决不仅仅是保证个人或子女不犯错误的问题，而是关系到党的生死存亡的大事。
    ——一个长治久安的社会，总是建立在健全的法制基础之上的。当今的中国，民主与法制建设必须相辅相成，但在法制体系尚不完备、有法不依现象还普遍存在的现实情况下，加强法制建设显得尤为重要。这样来认识问题决不是给民主自由加上“紧箍咒”，恰恰相反，是为了更有效地保证各级干部置于人民群众的有效监督之下，以保证公民在不损害国家和他人利益的范围内享有更广泛的民主自由。我们要避免类似“文化大革命”那样的灾难，要避免这次悲剧的重演，就必须用加强法制的方法来调节和制约社会生活，必须在全民中确立国家安全和稳定至上的观念。这是固本之举，是这次风波之后真正深邃的启示。
    ——理论上的含混不清必然带来思想行动上的混乱。近几年，一些搞资产阶级自由化的人借谈改革把许多理论是非搞颠倒了，而且流毒甚广，而我们在理论上也缺乏有力的抵制和廓清。因此，在一些带根本性的重大理论问题上，必须把全党的认识统一起来。譬如：在探索体制模式和运行机制时，绝不能忽视社会主义的根本原则；经济改革重视发展多种所有制成分，绝不能忽视上千个国营大中型企业是我国现代化生产的基本力量和核心部分；在重视发挥企业家或经营者的作用时，绝不能忽视工人阶级的主人翁地位；笼统地片面地宣传“商品经济观念”，会造成精神文明建设和政治思想工作的削弱，等等。我们的理论工作者，任重道远啊！
  ——民族精神的失落，在一些卷入动乱中的青年人的身上表现得极为突出。近几年，对外开放所挟裹进来的落后腐朽的东西，再加上长期以来反对资产阶级自由化不够一贯，在一些青年中滋长了一种对外盲目崇拜，对己妄自菲薄的情绪。这种情绪使得某些青年人把国家的前途和希望寄托在西方的资本主义制度上，而不是把祖国的命运和前途同中国共产党的领导、社会主义制度紧密联系在一起。这是很危险的。当今世界的任何一个发展中国家所面临的挑战，不单是来自新的技术革命，也是民族精神的挑战。一味地崇洋媚外，结果只能仰人鼻息。加强爱国主义教育，弘扬民族精神，社会主义中国才能发展成为一个名副其实的现代化的世界强国。每一个有志振兴中华的青年都应在这个问题上作出无愧于时代的选择。
    总之，大家都来思索过去，展望未来，“共和国卫士”的血就不会白流，社会主义中国的发展充满着胜利的希望。
