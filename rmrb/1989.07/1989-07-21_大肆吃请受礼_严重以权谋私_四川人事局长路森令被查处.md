People's Daily, Chengdu, July 20th - Reporter Chen Hua reports: Lu Senling, Director of the Sichuan Provincial Personnel Bureau, has been investigated for extravagant banquets, receiving gifts, and using his position for personal gain.

Originally the Secretary of the Luzhou Municipal Committee, Lu Senling was transferred to the position of Director of the Sichuan Provincial Personnel Bureau in September of last year. Based on reports from the public, the results of a joint investigation by the National Supervision Department and the Sichuan Provincial Supervision Bureau and other relevant departments indicate that from October 3 to November 5, 1988, within just 33 days, Lu Senling, under the pretext of resigning, accepted banquets from 67 units in five counties and one district in Luzhou City. On five of these occasions, his wife and children also attended, costing over 7,500 yuan in public funds. At the same time, Lu Senling also received more than 20 kinds of gifts, including high-end cigarettes, liquor, quartz clocks, and wool fabrics, from more than 10 units, with the value of the gifts initially confirmed to be over 2,000 yuan. During his "farewell" period, Lu Senling also drove over 250 kilometers to Gulin County, where the per capita income was less than 200 yuan, to accept gifts of liquor and other items, totaling 2,699 yuan in eating and drinking expenses.

The supervision department's investigation revealed that Lu Senling also used his authority to seek personal and familial benefits. In mid-to-late October 1988, Lu Senling had relevant units in Luzhou City renovate his accommodation at the Sichuan Provincial Personnel Bureau, costing over 6,000 yuan, without paying a single cent. Additionally, before leaving Luzhou, Lu Senling commissioned the head of the Municipal Committee's office to make a set of furniture worth approximately 2,100 yuan to take with him, paying only 310 yuan in processing fees to the factory.

During Lu Senling's tenure as Secretary of the Luzhou Municipal Committee, he used his authority to violate policies and arrange for his son to take the civil service exam and attend school. At that time, his family's household registration was not transferred to Luzhou, and according to regulations, his children did not qualify to take the civil service exam or attend school in Luzhou. However, Lu Senling used his authority to arrange for his son to obtain a temporary household registration in Luzhou City, and his son was recruited as a cadre in the Luzhou City Industrial and Commercial Bank. In early 1988, Lu Senling also instructed the leadership of the Luzhou City Industrial and Commercial Bank to fund 3,000 yuan for his son to study at the Southwest University of Finance and Economics.

Given that Lu Senling's actions seriously violated party discipline and government regulations, causing a negative impact among the public, the Sichuan Provincial Government has decided to suspend Lu Senling from his position as Director of the Sichuan Provincial Personnel Bureau. Currently, relevant departments are further investigating Lu Senling's serious abuse of power.

    大肆吃请受礼　严重以权谋私
    四川人事局长路森令被查处
    本报成都7月20日电　记者陈华报道：四川省人事局局长路森令，因大肆吃请受礼和利用职务为个人谋取私利，最近受到查处。
    原泸州市委书记路森令去年9月调任省人事局局长。根据群众的举报，国家监察部和四川省监察厅等有关部门的联合调查结果表明，在1988年10月3日至11月5日短短的33天里，路森令以辞行为名，到泸州市五县一区接受了67个单位的宴请，其中5次宴请还有他的妻子和子女参加，耗费公款7500余元。与此同时，路森令还收受了10多个单位用公款送的名烟、名酒、石英钟、毛料等20余种礼品，初步核实礼物价值达2千余元。路森令“辞行”期间还驱车250多公里，来到人均收入不足200元的古蔺县，收受名酒和其它礼物，加上吃喝共花费2699元。
    监察部门的调查表明，路森令还利用职权为个人和子女谋取私利。1988年10月中旬到下旬，路森令让泸州市的有关单位为其分配在省人事局的宿舍进行装修，费用高达6000余元，路森令分文未付。另外，路森令在离泸州前还委托市委办公室负责人做了一套价值约2100余元的家具带走，仅付给厂家310元加工费。
    在路森令担任泸州市委书记期间，他还利用职权违反政策安排儿子考干、上学。当时，其家属的户口均未迁到泸州，按政策规定，子女不具备在泸州考干、上学的资格。但是，路森令却利用职权，为儿子在泸州市办了临时户口，其子被录取为泸州市工商银行干部。1988年初，路森令又叫市工商银行领导出资3000元，让其子到西南财经大学读书。
    鉴于路森令的所作所为严重违反了党纪和政纪，在群众中造成了恶劣的影响，四川省政府已作出停止路森令四川省人事局局长职务的决定。目前，有关部门对路森令严重以权谋私问题正在作进一步查处。
