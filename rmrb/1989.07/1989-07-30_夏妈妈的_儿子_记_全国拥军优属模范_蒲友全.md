He, Communist Party member and disabled soldier Pu Youquan, has been taking care of a blind widow of a martyr for ten years. People praise him, the government commends him, and the General Political Department and the Ministry of Civil Affairs have bestowed upon him the honorable title of "National Model for Supporting the Military and Caring for Dependents."

In the army, Pu Youquan was a model soldier like Lei Feng, receiving multiple commendations and awards from the unit, and eventually becoming a squad leader and joining the Party. In January 1976, Pu Youquan unfortunately sustained an injury on duty. Two years later, he returned to his hometown of Dingshi Village, Hanbei Township, Sichuan Province, with a disabled soldier certificate.

Dingshi Village has a Summer Mother, named Xia Xuefen. Summer Mother's son sacrificed his life on the battlefield in Korea. In 1961, her husband passed away due to illness. From then on, she lived alone...

One afternoon, Pu Youquan saw Summer Mother struggling to carry a bucket of water, so he quickly went over to help her back home and fetched a full bucket of water for her. That night, Pu Youquan couldn't sleep: Summer Mother's thin, aged, and struggling figure kept appearing in his mind. What a good mother! If her son hadn't sacrificed himself, how could she end up like this? Summer Mother is already 74 years old, how can she live without anyone to take care of her? As a Communist Party member and a demobilized soldier, how can I stand idly by? From the next day on, Pu Youquan took on the responsibility of caring for Summer Mother. He fetched water and firewood for her, bought salt and oil for her, and took her to see doctors... People said, "Pu Youquan is like Summer Mother's own son."

At the end of 1978, Pu Youquan got married. His wife, Yang Yefang, is also a kind-hearted person. Usually, she and her husband together wash and mend clothes for Summer Mother, doing this and that. During festivals and family gatherings, they also invite Summer Mother to their home to share the joy. People said, "Yang Yefang is truly like Summer Mother's own daughter."

Unfortunately, something bad happened. On December 11, 1983, Summer Mother was heating her home when she accidentally started a fire. Suddenly, thick smoke rolled in, and flames roared. Pu Youquan rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, and single-handedly carried the unconscious Summer Mother out of the burning house. His clothes, hair, and eyebrows were burned, and his face, hands, and feet were covered in blisters.

The fire almost burned down all of Summer Mother's belongings. Pu Youquan then brought the old woman to his home to live. Not long after Summer Mother moved in, she completely lost her sight. Pu Youquan and his wife were afraid of neglecting the old woman, so every day when they went out early and returned late, they would go to the old woman's side and affectionately call out, "Mom." The children also called her "Grandma." In the summer, the children would fan and drive away mosquitoes for Grandma. When it got cold, Yang Yefang would always warm up the old woman's quilt with a heating basket first; during the coldest days, she would even sleep with the old woman to warm her feet. Grandma was old and her teeth were not good, so Pu Youquan and his wife Yang Yefang would cook the rice until it was very soft and stew the meat until it was very tender.

Summer Mother was old and weak, often falling ill. To ensure the old woman's health and longevity, Pu Youquan also learned massage therapy and injection techniques to provide general treatment for Summer Mother. Sometimes, when the old woman's condition was serious, no matter how much money was spent on medical treatment, he would not hesitate. In the winter of 1987, Summer Mother caught a severe cold and was bedridden. Pu Youquan carried the old woman to the township clinic for treatment. In the hospital, Yang Yefang stayed by the bedside day and night, helping the old woman with urination and defecation, cooking meals, and administering medicine. Summer Mother stayed in the hospital for eight days, spending over 300 yuan on medical expenses. Pu Youquan did not ask the government for a single cent of subsidy. To help the old woman recover quickly, Pu Youquan and his wife Yang Yefang tried their best to increase the old woman's nutrition. Once, Pu Youquan heard that there were fish balls for sale on the street, so he specially went to buy two catties and one ounce of fish balls to nourish Summer Mother. The elderly neighbors next door saw this and said enviously, "Xia Xuefen is truly blessed." Summer Mother said, "If I am blessed, it is all thanks to Youquan and Yefang; without them, my old bones would have been buried long ago!"

    夏妈妈的“儿子”
    ——记“全国拥军优属模范”蒲友全
    谢纲富　王太平
    他，共产党员、伤残军人蒲友全，十年如一日地赡养一位双目失明的烈士老妈妈。人们赞扬他，政府表彰他，总政治部和民政部授予他“全国拥军优属模范”的光荣称号。
    在部队，蒲友全是位雷锋式的好战士，多次受到部队的表扬和奖励，并且当了班长，入了党。一九七六年一月，蒲友全不幸因公受伤；两年后，带着一张伤残军人证书，退伍回到了自己的家乡——四川渠县汉碑乡丁字村。
    丁字村有位夏妈妈，叫夏学芬。夏妈妈的儿子在朝鲜战场为国捐躯。一九六一年，丈夫又因病去世。从此，她孤身一人……
    一天下午，蒲友全见夏妈妈用罐子艰难地提水，忙上前把老人搀回了家，并给她挑了满满一缸水。夜里，蒲友全睡不着了：夏妈妈那消瘦、苍老、艰难行走的身影一直浮现在他脑海里。多好的一位妈妈呀！儿子要不牺牲，怎会落得这般情景？夏妈妈已经七十四岁高龄，无人照顾怎么行呢？我作为一个共产党员、退伍军人，又怎能袖手旁观呢？从第二天起，蒲友全就承担起了照顾夏妈妈的义务。他为老人担水拿柴，为老人称盐打油，为老人请医看病……人们都说：“蒲友全就像夏妈妈的亲儿子。”
    一九七八年年底，蒲友全结婚了。他的妻子杨业芳也是一位心地善良的人。平时，她和丈夫一起为夏妈妈洗刷缝补，做这做那；逢年过节、亲朋欢聚时，还把夏妈妈请到家里，同享欢乐。人们又说：“杨业芳真像夏妈妈的亲闺女。”
    不幸的事情发生了。一九八三年十二月十一日，夏妈妈在家生火取暖，不慎失火，霎时浓烟滚滚，烈火熊熊。蒲友全闻讯赶到，只身冲进火海把昏迷过去的夏妈妈背了出来。他的衣服、头发眉毛烧焦了，脸上、手上、脚上烧起泡了。
    大火几乎烧光了夏妈妈的全部财产。蒲友全就把老人接到家里养老。夏妈妈到他家不久双目完全失明了。蒲友全和妻子生怕怠慢了老人，每天早出晚归都要到老人跟前亲切地叫一声
  “妈”；孩子也一口一声“婆婆”。夏天，孩子们为婆婆打扇驱赶蚊子。天冷了，杨业芳总是先用烘笼把老人的被子烤得热乎乎的；三九严寒，干脆跟老人一起睡，给老人煨脚。大妈年纪大，牙齿不中用，蒲友全和爱人杨业芳就把饭煮得熟熟的，把肉炖得烂烂的。
    夏妈妈年高体弱，经常患病，为了让老人健康长寿，蒲友全还学会了按摩疗法和打针技术，为夏妈妈进行一般的治疗。有时老人病情严重，花再多的钱医，他也在所不惜。一九八七年冬天，夏妈妈患了重感冒，卧床不起。蒲友全就把老人背到乡卫生院治疗。在医院里，杨业芳日夜守候在病床前，为老人接尿倒屎、煮饭喂药。夏妈妈住院八天，花去医药费三百多元，蒲友全没有伸手向政府申请一分钱的补助。为了使老人早日康复，蒲友全和妻子杨业芳尽量为老人增加营养。有一次，蒲友全听说街上有团鱼卖，便专程赶去为夏妈妈买了二斤一两团鱼补身子。隔壁邻舍的老人们见了，羡慕地说：“夏学芬真有福气。”夏妈妈说：“要说我有福，也是全托友全和业芳的福；要不是他俩，我这把老骨头早就入土了！”
