According to the State Administration for Religious Affairs' Policy and Law Department, various national-level religious organizations and sects in China have recently held meetings or issued statements expressing their firm support for the spirit of the CPC's 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session.

The China Christian Council and the Three-Self Patriotic Movement Committee of the Protestant Churches in China issued a statement, calling on all Christians and believers across the country to study under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the important speech by Chairman Deng Xiaoping to the senior military leaders of the Beijing martial law troops, and various important documents at present, to raise their patriotism and socialist awareness, and to strive together with the broad masses of the people to build a prosperous and strong motherland.

The Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, the Catholic Church Affairs Commission, and the Catholic Bishops' Conference of China held a meeting of chairpersons, vice-chairpersons in Beijing, standing committee members, and committee members. The attendees believed that the Fourth Plenary Session had rescued socialism and China, and that it had great significance in ensuring that our country and people continue to advance along the path of reform and opening up.

The Buddhist Association of China held a meeting of vice-presidents and standing committee members in Beijing. The attendees said that the Communist Party of China not only led the people to overthrow the three mountains and establish New China, but also defended the victory achievements, proving that the Communist Party of China is great and strong. They believed that the Party would definitely lead the people of the whole country to build a socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The Islamic Association of China held a meeting of the president, vice-presidents in Beijing, standing committee members, and committee members. The attendees expressed their satisfaction that nearly a thousand pilgrims who had gathered in Beijing after the suppression of the riot could depart on schedule for the pilgrimage, and they expressed their heartfelt thanks to the Party and the government. They said that General Secretary Jiang Zemin had clearly stated that the religious policy would not change, which had reassured the Islamic community and the broad masses of Muslims, and increased the confidence of the religious circles.

The Taoist Association of China has organized its staff in Beijing to study the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session and hold discussions over the past few days. They said that only by adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system could the four modernizations be realized, and only then could religious freedom be truly achieved.
