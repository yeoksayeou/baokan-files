	Finding Ways to Stabilize Prices
	—An Investigation in Taiyuan City
	Li Baoshi, Lei Wukui, Xiang Yanxiang

	Since the end of last year, Taiyuan City in Shanxi Province has launched a mass campaign to stabilize prices, achieving noticeable results. After February this year, the rate of price increases in the city has slowed down. By June, prices had started to decline, with the retail price index dropping by 3.8% compared to the previous month. The following are some of their methods.

	Launching a Mass Campaign to Stabilize Prices

	The Taiyuan City People's Price Stabilization Promotion Association was established on December 26, 1988. It currently has 508 member units, with 64% being state-owned, 30.2% collectively owned, and 5.2% individually owned. The association's mission is to actively promote price policies, assist the government in stabilizing prices, stabilizing the market, and promoting economic prosperity.

	The Price Stabilization Promotion Association organizes the supply of goods through joint purchasing and distribution, and split purchasing and joint sales, reducing circulation links and costs, and ensuring that the retail prices of member stores' goods are always at the lowest level in the city. Joint purchasing and distribution means that the Price Stabilization Promotion Association organizes the supply of goods to member units, selling at the lowest price of similar goods in Taiyuan City. Split purchasing and joint sales mean that a member unit organizes the supply of goods for other member units to sell together. The association also frequently organizes key industrial and commercial enterprises' factory directors and managers to hold dialogues, promoting production and sales. Member units also pool funds to invest in detergent factories and monosodium glutamate factories that are short of funds; while for daily necessities such as soap, detergent, candy, and beverages, factories directly supply member units for fixed-point price-controlled sales.

	Member units follow a common set of activity rules and implement open supervision and public evaluation. Member stores issue "Price Credit Cards" to customers. If the price of goods purchased from them is higher than that of other stores, customers can go to the original purchasing store to get the price difference refunded. They also set up a "Price Supervision Desk" in the Taiyuan Daily, distributing ballots in the newspaper to let citizens evaluate the satisfaction and dissatisfaction of price-stabilizing stores. After three large state-owned stores were evaluated as unsatisfactory, they took effective measures to improve their work and regained the trust of the public. The 600-plus price supervision staff organized by the trade unions of member units also actively cooperate with government price management agencies, timely reporting market price information. These practices have formed a city-wide price supervision network, greatly enhancing the government's ability to manage prices.

	The Taiyuan City People's Price Stabilization Promotion Association was gradually formed in the process of the city's commercial workers voluntarily initiating the "Stabilize Prices and Benefit the People" activity. It embodies the high level of public participation and the spirit of sharing the nation's burdens, reminding us that to rectify, regulate, and stabilize prices, we need not only macro-control measures taken by various levels of government departments but also the conscious actions of the broad masses. We should combine these two aspects to establish a new market order.

	Playing the Main Channel Role of the Wholesale Industry

	Taiyuan City's commercial system separates wholesale and retail. There are currently 10 types of wholesale companies, which were established in 1984 after the commercial wholesale system reform, merging the provincial second-level stations and municipal third-level stations. Over the past five years, these wholesale institutions have transformed their business ideas and, in terms of business methods, promoted the practice of direct production and sales, that is, directly purchasing goods from the first-level station for out-of-town products and directly from the factory for local products. This reduces circulation links and plays the main channel role of the commercial wholesale industry in stabilizing prices. Specific practices are as follows:

	Commercial support for industry, adhering to the principle of "industry over commerce" in profit distribution, wholesale actively gives concessions to industry, and industry organizes production according to demand. Aluminum products, soap, and batteries are among the goods whose production factories are on the brink of shutdown due to losses. The Taiyuan City Department Store Wholesale Company actively gave up 7% of the difference to the factory. Last year, it alone incurred a loss of 340,000 yuan in the operation of matches. This year, in the face of a shortage of cotton textiles, it again allocated 800,000 bales of cotton for processing orders. This ensured the normal production of enterprises, stabilized prices, and increased effective supply.

	Adopting joint sales and prepayment methods for cooperation, ensuring the supply of goods. Taiyuan City's self-sufficiency rate for household electrical appliances is low. The Taiyuan City Hardware and Electrical Appliances Wholesale Company adopts joint sales and prepayment methods to cooperate with Shanghai, Tianjin, and Dalian, ensuring the market supply of color TVs and bicycles. The Taiyuan City Sugar, Liquor, and Food Wholesale Company has fixed business relations with second-level stations in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country, as well as with third-level stations within the province. After the centralized wholesale of famous wines, the price of Fen wine fell by 41.7% in the first quarter.

	The Taiyuan City Poultry Company implements production and sales integration, and state-owned commerce and food factories can directly purchase from the production area. The Taiyuan City Vegetable Company's sales volume accounts for more than 50% of the city's residents' demand, and some large and medium-sized vegetable markets have established production and sales direct connection points with the production area, making the prices of meat, poultry, eggs, and vegetables, which are indispensable to people's lives, no longer fluctuate greatly due to supply issues, enriching residents' vegetable baskets.

	The Problem of Too Many Circulation Links Needs to Be Solved

	The number of circulation channels should be appropriate for the level of commodity production. In recent years, due to differing understandings, wholesale institutions have been overlapping, and the more scarce the goods, the more circulation links there are. First, there is layer-upon-layer wholesale, with the province establishing a trade company and then establishing a trade group, essentially restoring the functions of the provincial second-level station. From the province to the county, there are five levels of wholesale institutions, all vying for goods, causing goods to rise in price, accumulate, and funds to be delayed. Second, there is no distinction between wholesale and retail, with state-owned units, collectives, and individuals all engaging in wholesale. Taiyuan City has 658 stores selling sugar, liquor, and food wholesale, and no one knows how many units across the province are engaged in various wholesale businesses. Third, factories engage in wholesale. The Shanxi Cotton Textile Factory sells its products through the supply and marketing department to the factory labor service company, which then sells to the Taiyuan City Department Store Wholesale Company, with the price increasing with each link from production to supply.

	If too many intermediate links are not cut off, then the highest limit price and state-guided price will not work, and prices will continue to rise, making it difficult to stabilize prices. Therefore, to rectify the economic environment, fundamental measures must be taken to comprehensively rectify the wholesale links.

	First, define the scope of wholesale operations, limiting important production materials and living necessities to be operated only by state-owned commercial enterprises, separating wholesale and retail, and individuals not engaging in wholesale. The supply and marketing difference rate of industrial enterprise products should be narrowed. Second, play the role of the commodity distribution center in central cities, and do not set up overlapping wholesale institutions within the same city. Third, the industrial and commercial administrative departments and commercial management departments should jointly approve and issue business licenses, and at the same time, adjust bank loans to commerce. Sufficient funds should be allocated to state-owned wholesale commerce.

    多想办法平抑物价
    ——太原市的调查
    李宝实　雷武科　向艳祥
    从去年底开始，山西省太原市开展了群众性平抑物价活动，取得了明显效果。今年2月份以后，全市物价上涨幅度趋缓，到6月份，物价有所下降，零售物价指数比上月回落3.8％。这里介绍的是他们的一些做法。
            开展群众性平抑物价活动
    太原市人民群众平抑物价促进会是1988年12月26日成立的，现有会员单位508家，其中国营占64％，集体占30.2％，个体占5.2％。该会的宗旨是积极宣传物价政策，协助政府平抑物价，稳定市场，繁荣经济。
    平抑物价促进会采取联购分销、分购联销的形式组织货源，以减少流通环节和费用，保证会员商店的商品零售价格始终处于全市最低水平。联购分销，即由平抑物价促进会统一组织货源供应会员单位，以太原市同类商品最低价设点销售。分购联销，即由某一家会员单位组织货源供其它会员单位联合销售。促进会还经常组织一些重点工商企业的厂长、经理协商对话，促进产销见面。会员单位还集资向资金短缺的洗涤剂厂、味精厂投资；而对人民生活必需品，如肥皂、洗衣粉、糖果、饮料等，则由工厂直供会员单位，定点控价销售。
    会员单位执行共同的活动规则，并实行公开监督，群众评议。会员商店向顾客发放“物价信誉卡”，顾客从他们那里购买的商品，若价格高于其他商店，可以到原购货商店领回差价款。他们还在《太原日报》设了“物价监督台”，在报纸上发放选票，让市民评选平抑物价满意与不满意商店。有3家大型国营商店被评为不满意的商店后，采取了行之有效的措施，改进了工作，重新取得了群众的信赖。由会员单位工会组织的600余名职工物价监督员，也与政府物价管理机构积极配合，及时通报市场物价信息。这些作法形成了全市的物价监督网络，使政府管理物价的能力大大增强。
    太原市人民群众平抑物价促进会，是在市商界职工自觉地发起“平抑物价、让利于民”活动中逐步形成的。它体现了人民群众的高度参与意识和为国分忧的精神，给我们的启示是，治理、整顿，稳定物价，既要靠各级政府部门采取宏观调控措施，也要靠广大群众的自觉行动，将这两者结合起来，建立市场新秩序。
          发挥批发行业的主渠道作用
    太原市商贸系统批发与零售分设。现有各类批发公司10个，是1984年实行商业批发体制改革，由省二级站和市三级站合并后组建的。5年来，这些批发机构转变经营思想，在经营方式上推行产销直挂的办法，即外地产品直接从一级站进货，本地产品直接从工厂进货。这样做减少了流通环节，发挥了商贸批发行业在平抑物价中的主渠道作用。具体做法是：
    商业扶持工业，坚持“工大于商”的利润分配原则，批发主动向工业让利，工业按需求组织生产。铝制品、肥皂、电池等商品，因生产厂家亏损，濒临停产。市百货批发公司主动把7％的差额全部让给工厂，去年仅经营火柴一项就赔本34万元，今年在棉纺织品紧缺的情况下，又拿出80万担棉花加工订货。保证了企业正常生产，稳住了物价，增加了有效供给。
    采取联销、预付货款的方式联营，保证了货源。太原市家电工业品自产率低，市五金交电批发公司采取联销和预付款方式与上海、天津、大连联营，保证了市场彩电、自行车的供应。市糖酒副食品批发公司与全国29个省市区的二级站及省内的三级站都有固定的业务往来，名优酒统一归口批发后，一季度汾酒价格下浮了41.7％。
    市家禽公司推行产销一体化，国营商业、食品厂可以直接从产地进货。市蔬菜公司经销量占全市市民需求量的50％以上，部分大中蔬菜市场与产地确定了产销直挂点，使与群众生活不可缺少的肉、禽、蛋、蔬菜的价格不再因货源问题而大起大落，丰富了居民的菜篮子。
    流通环节过多的问题尚需解决
    流通渠道的多寡应与商品生产的发达程度相适应。近几年，由于认识不统一，批发机构重叠，越是紧俏的商品，流通环节越多。一是层层搞批发，省里成立了贸易公司，又要成立贸易集团，实际上是要恢复省二级站职能，从省到县有五级批发机构，大家都抓货源，造成商品涨价、积压，资金滞流。二是批零不分，国营单位、集体、个体都搞批发，太原市经营糖酒和副食品批发的商店就有658家，全省各类经营批发业务的单位有多少谁也说不清楚。三是工厂搞批发，山西棉纺厂将产品由供销科批发给厂劳动服务公司，再由厂劳动服务公司批发给市百货批发公司，由产到供经过三道环节，而且价格一次比一次高。
    如果过多的中间环节不砍掉，那么最高限价、国家指导价都将不起作用，轮番涨价，物价难以稳定。因此，治理经济环境必须采取根本性的措施，对批发环节进行全面整顿。
    首先要划定批发经营权限，限定重要生产资料和生活资料只能由国营商业企业经营，批零分设，个体不得经营批发，工业企业产品自销要缩小供销和批零差率。其次要发挥中心城市商品集散中心的作用，同城不设重叠批发机构。第三，由工商行政管理部门和商业主管部门共同审批核发经营执照，同时调整银行对商业的贷款，对国营批发商业要拨足资金。
