People's Daily, Hangzhou, July 4th — Reports by People's Daily reporter Gao Haihao and Xinhua News Agency reporter Yu Yun Da: Heavy rain has been falling in western Zhejiang, causing floods and severe damage. The provincial party committee and government held an emergency meeting last night and this morning to further deploy anti-flood and disaster relief efforts, calling on all levels of leadership to go to the front lines of disaster relief to minimize losses.

Since June 27, western Zhejiang has experienced continuous heavy rain and torrential downpours, with cumulative rainfall reaching 300 to 500 millimeters. The upstream rivers of Qiantangjiang, including Qujiang, Jinhua River, Lanjiang, and Fuchunjiang, have either reached or exceeded dangerous water levels, causing major floods. Several flood control dikes have breached, large areas of farmland have been flooded, houses have collapsed, and there have been casualties. According to incomplete statistics from the provincial flood control headquarters on July 4, 25 counties (cities) and 215 townships across the province have been affected by heavy rain, with 2.05 million people affected, 31 deaths, 73 serious injuries, 312 villages flooded, and nearly 40,000 people surrounded by floodwaters. The disaster has also caused nearly 10,000 houses to collapse, 26,000 houses to be damaged, and more than 1.5 million acres of farmland to be flooded, with 680,000 acres suffering a reduction in yield of more than 30%.

After the disaster, more than 500 soldiers from local military units, equipped with rubber boats and speedboats, rushed to the hardest-hit areas of Lanxi City to rescue and relocate more than 30,000 people who had been surrounded by floodwaters for two days and nights. Leaders from the provincial government also rushed to the disaster area to direct operations on the spot.

At the time of this report, a large-scale rain cloud system still lingered over Zhejiang.

    6月27日以来，浙江西部地区连降暴雨和大暴雨，累计降雨量已达300至500毫米。钱塘江上游的衢江、金华江、兰江和富春江先后接近或突破危急水位，发生了大洪水，一批防洪堤坝决口，大批农田受淹，民房倒塌，人员伤亡。据省防汛指挥部7月4日的不完全统计，全省遭受暴雨灾害的有25个县（市）、215个乡镇，受灾人数达205万，死亡31人，重伤73人，受淹村庄312个，近4万群众被洪水围困。灾害还使近万间民房倒塌，2.6万间民房受损，受淹农田达150余万亩，其中减产三成以上的成灾面积68万亩。
    灾情发生后，当地驻军500多官兵随带橡皮艇、冲锋艇等救生器材奔赴受灾最严重的兰溪市，救援转移已被洪水围困两昼夜的3万多灾民，省政府有关领导也赶赴灾区，现场指挥。
    到记者发稿时止，较大范围的降雨云系仍盘踞在浙江上空。
