Lanhuaping is a scenic spot in the Ciping Scenic Area of Jinggangshan, located in the mountains to the southeast of Ciping. It is named "Lanhuaping" because of the abundance of various orchids, particularly the Jinggangshan orchid. The land in Lanhuaping is fertile, the climate is mild, ancient trees tower into the sky, and evergreens thrive year-round. It also retains large areas of ancient osmanthus trees, hence it is also known as "Guihuaping."

Jinggangshan is a mountain of flowers, situated in the middle section of the Luoxiao Mountains. Surrounded by high mountains that block cold winds, it enjoys a mild climate year-round, along with abundant rainfall. This creates an excellent environment for the growth of various plants and flowers, resulting in a high forest coverage rate and ever-blooming flowers and trees. Both subtropical and warm-temperate flora thrive here. Among the numerous flowers, the orchid stands out, particularly the "Jinggangshan orchid." In March 1962, when Comrade Zhu De revisited Jinggangshan, he specially came to Lanhuaping to appreciate the flowers and enjoy tea. Before leaving Jinggangshan, Zhu De returned to Lanhuaping and personally dug up some "Jinggangshan orchids" to take back to Zhongnanhai for planting. Nowadays, besides Lanhuaping, the "Jinggangshan orchid" can be seen throughout the 500-li expanse of Jinggangshan. The people of Jinggangshan widely recount the story of "Comrade Zhu planting orchids, spreading fragrance across the borders of Hunan and Jiangxi for 800 li." There is a red folk song that goes: "Comrade Zhu brought water from the Xiangjiang River, watering the Jinggangshan orchids to bloom..."

Jinggangshan is home to a variety of orchids, the most famous being the four-season orchids: spring orchids, summer orchids, autumn orchids, and winter orchids. They are graceful and colorful, some blooming across the mountains, others competing in beauty within the garden city.

    井冈兰花坪
    薛锦  善广
    兰花坪是井冈山茨坪景区的一胜景，位于茨坪东南面的山间。因那里盛产各种兰花，尤其是井冈兰，故称“兰花坪”。兰花坪土地肥沃，气候温和，古木参天，四季长青，还保留成片的集生古桂，故又称为“桂花坪”。
    井冈山是一座花山，它座落在罗霄山脉中段，四面高山阻挡着寒流，一年四季气候温和，加之充沛的雨量，给各种植物花草生长造成了优越的环境，所以森林覆盖率高，花木四季不凋，亚热带和温热带的花木都长得郁郁葱葱。兰花在这里众多的花卉中要称为佼佼者，尤其是“井冈兰”。1962年3月，朱德同志重上井冈山时，特意来到兰花坪赏花品茶，离开井冈山之时，朱德又到兰花坪，亲手挖了“井冈兰”，带回中南海去栽种。如今，除兰花坪有“井冈兰”外，五百里井冈都能看到那白中透黄、香味馥郁的“井冈兰”。井冈山群众中广传着“当年朱军长引种兰花，香飘湘赣边界八百里”的美谈。有一首红色歌谣唱着：“朱军长挑来湘江水、浇得井冈兰花放……”
    井冈山的兰花品种繁多，最有名的是四季兰：春兰、夏兰、秋兰、冬兰，绰约多姿、五彩缤纷，有的开放在漫山遍野，有的斗艳在花园城中。
