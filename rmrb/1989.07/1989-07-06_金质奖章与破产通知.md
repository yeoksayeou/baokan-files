Recently, the "Soviet Sixty Years" collective farm in Krasnoyshchokovsk district of the Altai Territory received two notices almost simultaneously: one from Moscow, awarding it a gold medal at the Soviet National Economic Achievement Exhibition for being the leading farm in the district and one of the top farms in the territory; the other from the local branch of the Agricultural Industrial Bank, notifying it of bankruptcy.

This fact is hard to accept, but it is in accordance with the law.

The story goes back to 1972. At that time, this collective farm was one of the poorest and most backward in the district. After Ivan Abramovich Tyebeykin was elected chairman of the collective farm that year, he decided to lead the farmers to change the farm's appearance. Soon, the farm began to shake off poverty and had some surplus. Tyebeykin wanted to change the "poor" image of the farm, planning to build 250 new houses in the village, a new commercial center, hotel, bakery, cultural palace, and new roads. So many projects, the farm's own funds were not enough, so Tyebeykin repeatedly sought loans from the bank, and the bank repeatedly granted them, and the higher authorities also supported Tyebeykin's "cause."

In recent years, the reform wind has blown to Altai, and many economic units have begun to implement full economic accounting and self-raising funds, but the "Soviet Sixty Years" collective farm still operates according to the old rules, and when there is no money, it asks the state for loans.

In 1986, the bank sounded the alarm for the first time, refusing to grant loans to the farm, but Tyebeykin did not care, he went to the district leadership to run around, and the higher authorities immediately intervened, and the bank had to give in. The next year, the same thing happened again.

However, the bank finally acted according to the law of the cooperative society and stopped granting loans to it. After investigation, it was found that the farm had no payment ability as early as July last year, and in recent years, the farm's basic construction was also entirely dependent on bank loans. The farm accumulated a debt of 14 million rubles to the bank, of which 1.7 million rubles had long overdue. January of this year was the deadline set by the bank for the repayment of this 1.7 million rubles. But the farm was completely unable to repay it. The district and the territory had begun to look for ways to help it half a year ago, and some neighbors had proposed some good-hearted suggestions. For example, the chairman of the Kalinin collective farm in the same district, Yuyugin, said that his farm could repay the debt for his neighbor, and in return, he hoped to temporarily use the "Soviet Sixty Years" collective farm's pig farm until he earned back the 1.7 million rubles he had paid. The Slavgorod Agricultural Industrial Company also said it could lend money to the "Soviet Sixty Years," on the condition that it temporarily use part of the farm's land.

These two plans were not accepted by the members of the "Soviet Sixty Years" farm. They still hoped that the state would "turn a blind eye."

At the end of last year, the "Soviet Sixty Years" collective farm held a meeting to discuss the farm's future, and the members deeply regretted that they had built so many buildings at once.

Public opinion believes that the "Soviet Sixty Years" collective farm has not fundamentally changed its thinking in the new situation. If the farm cannot properly assess its economic capabilities and live within its means, then any assistance will be of no avail and will not prevent it from going bankrupt.

    金质奖章与破产通知
    许宏治
    不久前，苏联阿尔泰边疆区克拉斯诺晓科夫斯克区的“苏联六十年”集体农庄几乎同时收到两份通知：一份来自莫斯科，授予它苏联国民经济成就展览会金质奖章，以表彰这个各项指标在全区名列第一、在全边疆区也居于前列的“先进农庄”；另一份来自农工银行地方分行，通知它破产。
    这一事实令人难以接受，但却合乎规律。
    事情要从一九七二年说起。当时，这个集体农庄是全区最贫穷落后的集体农庄之一。伊万·阿布拉莫维奇·季别伊金于这一年当选集体农庄主席以后，决心率领庄员改变农庄面貌。没多久，农庄开始摆脱贫困，有了一些盈余。季别伊金想变一变农庄的“穷酸”样，计划在村里建二百五十栋新住宅，盖新的商业中心、宾馆、烤面包房、文化宫，以及铺设新的道路。这么多工程，光靠农庄自己的资金是不够的，于是季别伊金一再向银行求助，银行也一再给以贷款，而且上级机关也支持季别伊金的这项“事业”。
    近年来，改革之风吹到了阿尔泰，许多经济单位开始实行完全经济核算和自筹资金，但“苏联六十年”集体农庄仍按老规矩办事，没有钱就向国家要贷款。
    一九八六年，银行第一次敲响了警钟，拒绝向农庄发放贷款，但季别伊金并不在意，他到区领导机关奔走一番，上级即出面说情，银行只好让步。第二年，这样的事情又重复了一次。
    但是，银行终于按合作社法办事，停止给它发放贷款。经调查，去年七月该农庄就没有了支付能力，而且近几年农庄的基本建设也是全靠银行贷款。农庄累计积欠银行贷款一千四百万卢布，其中一百七十万卢布早已逾期。今年一月是银行规定的这一百七十万卢布的最后偿还期限。但农庄根本无力偿还。区和边疆区半年前已开始想方设法为它寻找出路，一些左邻右舍倒是提出了一些好心的建议。例如，同区的加里宁集体农庄主席尤尤金表示，他的农庄可以替邻居偿还债务，作为补偿，希望暂时使用“苏联六十年”集体农庄的养猪场，直到挣回垫付的一百七十万卢布。斯拉夫戈罗德农工联合公司也表示可以借钱给“苏联六十年”，条件是暂时使用这个农庄的部分土地。
    这两个方案没有被“苏联六十年”的庄员们接受。他们仍寄希望于国家“高抬贵手”。
    去年年底，“苏联六十年”集体农庄开会讨论农庄的出路，庄员们十分后悔，当初一下盖那么多的建筑物。
    舆论认为，“苏联六十年”集体农庄在新形势下，思想认识没有发生根本变化，如果农庄不能很好地估计自己的经济能力，量入为出，那么任何援助都将无济于事，不能使它避免破产。
