Fujian Province has started, from July 1, to implement a statutory old-age insurance system for employees in collective and private enterprises across the province.

The old-age insurance for collective enterprise employees in Fujian is implemented through a "dual-layer combined" approach. This means that enterprises contribute 6% to 8% of the total wage bill for social pooling, which serves as the base for employees' old-age pensions upon retirement. Supplementary old-age insurance is jointly contributed by enterprises and employees on a monthly basis, accumulated individually, and old-age pensions are paid based on the length of contribution and the amount contributed. Both basic and supplementary old-age insurances are statutory, and neither can be omitted.

The old-age insurance for private enterprise employees is basically the same as that for collective enterprises.

    福建集体私营企业职工开始享受法定养老保险
    据新华社福州7月14日电　（记者张瑞三）福建省从7月1日开始，对全省集体、私营企业职工实行法定养老保险制度。
    福建省制定的集体企业职工养老保险是实行“双层结合式”的办法。即由企业按工资总额的6％至8％进行社会统筹，作为职工退休后领取养老金的基数；补充养老保险是由企业和在职职工每月共同缴纳的按人储存积累的保险，并按缴纳年限长短和金额多少付给养老金。基本和补充两种养老保险均为法定养老保险，两者缺一不可。
    私营企业职工的养老保险，基本上与集体企业相同。
