How to effectively conduct political situation education and address the hot and difficult questions raised by the masses? The "Military Camp and Society—Perspective, Hot Topics, Difficult Issues" topic and answer activity organized by the Political Department of the Navy, the Propaganda Department of the Air Force, and the People's Navy newspaper has achieved remarkable results.

This activity began in February of this year. The organizers seized on hot topics, encouraging the broad masses of soldiers to use the Four Cardinal Principles and their personal experiences to educate themselves. They focused on addressing views and trends prevalent in society, such as the "devaluation of spiritual rewards," "obsolete hard work," and "political faith is idealism," and opened up topic and answer discussions. Over the past five months, soldiers have enthusiastically participated in asking and answering questions, submitting nearly two thousand articles. This has transformed the previous one-way indoctrination of situation education into a multi-directional exchange, effectively achieving the goals of "broadening horizons, guiding thoughts, understanding the situation, and firming beliefs."

    《人民海军》辟新栏  “征题征答”收效好
    本报讯　抓好政治形势教育，如何解答群众提出的一些热点、难点问题？海军政治部、空军宣传部和《人民海军》报社组织的《军营与社会——视角·热点·难题》征题征答活动，收效显著。
    这项活动是今年2月开始进行的。组织者抓住热门话题，让广大官兵用四项基本原则和亲身经历，自己教育自己。针对社会上流行的“精神奖励贬值论”、“艰苦奋斗过时论”、“政治信仰唯心论”等观点和思潮，展开征题征答讨论。5个月来，官兵们踊跃提问征答，来稿近二千篇，变以往形势教育的“单项灌输”为“多向交流”，较好地达到了“开阔视野、疏导思路、认清形势、坚定信念”的目的。
