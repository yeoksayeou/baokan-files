Nicaragua ordered the expulsion of an American-Nicaraguan citizen, Antonio Ivara, on the evening of the 6th for engaging in illegal activities in Nicaragua.

The official Nicaraguan newspaper, *Barricada*, reported on the 7th that Ivara entered Managua under the guise of a "businessman." However, relevant authorities discovered that after obtaining a press pass, he falsely claimed to be a foreign political observer to the Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Court. Furthermore, Ivara attempted to remain in Nicaragua as a representative of the U.S. "Freedom House."

The newspaper stated that, given Ivara's activities that did not match his stated identity, the government ordered him to leave the country within 48 hours.

    尼驱逐一美国人
    新华社马那瓜7月7日电  尼加拉瓜6日晚下令将在尼加拉瓜从事非法活动的美籍尼加拉瓜人安东尼奥·伊瓦拉驱逐出境。
    尼加拉瓜官方的《街垒报》7日报道，伊瓦拉是以“商人”身份进入马那瓜的。但有关当局发现他在获取了记者证后，又向尼最高选举法庭谎称是外国政治观察员。此外，伊瓦拉还试图以美国“自由之家”代表的身份留在尼加拉瓜。
    该报说，鉴于伊瓦拉进行了与其身份不相符的活动，政府限令其在48小时内离境。
