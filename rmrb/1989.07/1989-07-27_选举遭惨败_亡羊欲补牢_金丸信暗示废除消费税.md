The Liberal Democratic Party's largest faction, the Takeshita faction, held a full meeting today. Chairman Kinmura Shin hinted that the consumption tax, which is widely opposed by the public, should be abolished.

In his speech, he said that the true reason for the Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in the House of Councillors election was the consumption tax. The tax has been resisted by the public. If a town mayor or village chief faces resistance from his constituents, he must resign. Therefore, the consumption tax issue must be seriously addressed; otherwise, the Liberal Democratic Party may face another defeat in the upcoming House of Representatives election.

The consumption tax is a large indirect tax introduced by the Japanese government in April to increase government revenue. Both before and after its implementation, it has faced widespread public opposition. The opposition Socialist Party, which won in the House of Councillors election, is now collaborating with other opposition parties to prepare a bill to abolish this new tax in the Diet.

For the Liberal Democratic Party, this issue has put it in a difficult position. Continuing with the tax will not change the confrontational stance between the public and the Liberal Democratic Party government. If it is abolished, the Liberal Democratic Party government's political prestige will be damaged. Currently, Prime Minister Uno and others have promised to amend the tax system.

Kinmura Shin has previously held the position of Deputy Prime Minister. When the Diet passed the consumption tax, he served as the chairman of the House of Representatives Taxation Special Committee, making him the "midwife" of the consumption tax. This influential figure within both the Liberal Democratic Party and the government will significantly impact the fate of the consumption tax.

### 选举遭惨败　亡羊欲补牢  金丸信暗示废除消费税

    选举遭惨败　亡羊欲补牢
    金丸信暗示废除消费税
    新华社东京7月27日讯　（记者王大军）据时事社报道，日本自民党内最大派系竹下派会长金丸信今天在该派举行的全体会议上暗示，应当废除为国民普遍反对的消费税。
    他在会上发表讲话时说，自民党在参院选举中失败的真正原因，主要就是消费税。消费税遭到国民的抵制。町长、村长如果遭到町民、村民抵制，他必须辞职。因此，必须认真对待消费税问题，否则在今后的众院选举中自民党又可能失败。
    消费税是日本政府为增加政府收入于今年4月引进的一种大型间接税。实行前后，均遭到国民的普遍反对。在野的社会党在参院选举中胜利后，正联合其他在野党准备向国会提出废除这一新税的法案。
    对自民党来说，它在这一问题上正处于进退维谷的境地。坚持实行下去，将改变不了国民与自民党政府对立的局面。如果取消，则有失自民党政府的政治威信。目前，宇野首相等已许诺修改这一税制。
    金丸信曾任过政府副首相要职。在国会通过消费税时，他担任众院税制特别委员会委员长，可以说是消费税的“接生婆”。这位在自民党和政府内均具很强实力的人物的表态，将给消费税的命运带来很大影响。
