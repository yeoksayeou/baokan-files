It was reported that: “Students in Tanluo, a suburb of Nanning, attend classes amidst graves.” “Old graves as classrooms, ancestors accompany the living.” Both teachers and students feel deeply that the environment is poor, oppressive, and stifling.

According to a report by the Guangxi Daily on April 17th: A classroom in Taotang Primary School, Teng County, was forcibly demolished by several dozen Li-surname villagers and rebuilt into a tall and large grave. After the new grave was built, many villagers came to the school to burn paper and set off firecrackers to pay their respects, causing disturbances and making it impossible to have normal classes.

For years, allowing “ancestors to accompany the living” and having the dead act as “supervisors,” making teachers and students live in a state of constant unease amidst graves, is not only harmful to the physical and mental health of teachers and students, but also hinders the quality of education. Moreover, if the ancestors knew, they would not rest in peace.

Generally, those with foresight, whether officials or the public, would not let their ancestors accompany students in their studies, nor would they do the foolish thing of demolishing classrooms to build ancestral graves. Li Zucai, a professor at Central South Industrial University and a native of Teng County, Guangxi, wrote in a letter to his hometown relatives when the conflict between the ancestral graves and the school arose: “Graves are private matters, schools are public affairs, and the so-called auspicious sites should be left for the schools.” Such words and deeds are truly exemplary.

It is reported that, due to the government's intervention and the cooperation of relevant departments, detailed work has been done, and the graves in the schoolyards of Tanluo Primary School and Taotang Primary School have been relocated from the school grounds. Teachers no longer have to teach in front of rows of graves, and students are no longer supervised by their ancestors while studying. It seems that people can be educated, and with effort, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. As long as we are determined to tackle it, the cause of education will have hope.

### 坟墓和学校

    坟墓和学校
    报载：“南宁市郊坛洛小学生在坟丛中上课”。“老坟蹲学堂，先人伴后人”。老师和学生都深感环境恶劣，令人沉闷窒息。
    又据广西日报四月十七日报道：藤县陶塘小学的一间教室被附近村里的几十名李姓群众强行拆毁，并被修建成一座又高又大的坟墓。新墓建成后，很多群众又纷纷到校内烧纸燃炮拜坟，闹得不得安宁，无法正常上课。
    长年累月让“先人伴后人”、死人当“监学”，使老师和莘莘学子们成天生活在坟丛墓地中，坐立不安地度日，不仅有害于老师和学生的身心健康，妨碍教学质量，而且倘若先人地下有知，也是不得安息的。
    大凡有识之士，无论干部或民众，是不会让先祖陪伴学子们读书的，也不会去干拆毁教室修建祖坟的蠢事的。祖籍广西藤县、现在中南工业大学当教授的李祖材老师，在祖坟与学校发生矛盾时，毅然在给家乡亲人的信中写道：“坟墓是私人小事，学校是公家大事，应该把所谓风水宝地让给学校。”如此言行，不愧为人之师表。
    据悉，由于政府出面和有关部门配合，作过细工作，坛洛小学和陶塘小学校园内的坟墓已从校内迁走，教师们不再面对座座坟墓教学，学子们也不再被先祖监督着读书了。看来，人是可教育的，事在人为。只要我们下决心抓，就没有克服不了的困难，教育事业就会有希望。
