In just over thirty days, the 15th Summer World University Games will grandly open. This international comprehensive sports event, known as the "Little Olympics," has become increasingly popular over the past decade, with each edition surpassing the previous one in both scale and level. However, this year's University Games has faced numerous obstacles and nearly "fizzled out."

Several years ago, this event was scheduled to be held in São Paulo, Brazil's largest city, which had been diligently preparing for it. However, by the end of last year, São Paulo suddenly announced that due to financial and other issues, it would withdraw from hosting the event. At that time, there were only about six months left until the opening ceremony, which greatly worried the International University Sports Federation led by Prudentio de Oliveira. They urgently sought alternative venues. As time passed, no one was willing to take on the responsibility, not even Seoul, which had just hosted the Olympics and had all the necessary facilities.

In a critical moment, Juan Antonio Samaranch, the President of the International Olympic Committee, stepped in to help. By the end of March, Duisburg, a city in West Germany with a population of only 400,000, extended a helping hand and agreed to host the event, ensuring it would be held on schedule. Duisburg is a small city located on the Rhine River. One of the main reasons it agreed to host the event was to leave a good impression on the international sports community and create conditions for the Ruhr region to bid for the 2000 or 2004 Olympics.

The World University Games typically include 10 or 11 competitive events. Due to the short preparation time of only four months for this edition, the number of events had to be reduced to four (basketball, athletics, rowing, and fencing). Despite this, the scale of the games remains substantial. Recently, Prudentio de Oliveira announced that 81 countries and regions have registered to participate, with an estimated 2,000 to 2,500 athletes. A group of world-class athletes will compete, and the level of basketball competition is likely to be the highest in the history of the games.

Since most of the United States' top athletes are university students, the U.S. university sports delegation will not be much weaker than the Olympic team. Additionally, after losing to the Soviet Union and East Germany in the 1988 Olympics, the Americans are eager to redeem themselves. This University Games will be an opportunity for them to regain their momentum.

The organizing committee for this edition is working hard to overcome difficulties and is systematically preparing for the event. All competition venues will utilize existing facilities. The venue conditions are acceptable. However, accommodating several thousand athletes for food and lodging will be a significant challenge. Duisburg is a small city with few large hotels, and most athletes will be scattered around the surrounding areas, which will also create transportation issues. As for funding, in addition to the federal government's pledge of 30 million Marks, the rest will mainly be raised from the Ruhr region. The organizing committee's total budget is 100 million Marks, which is clearly insufficient. For comparison, the budget for the next World University Games in Sheffield, England, in 1991, is approximately 230 million Marks.

It seems that the wealthy Germans will certainly be very thrifty in organizing this event, making every penny count.

### “起死回生”的世界大学生运动会

    “起死回生”的世界大学生运动会
    再过三十几天，第15届夏季世界大学生运动会将隆重开幕。这项有“小奥运会”之称的国际综合运动会，近10年越办越红火，无论规模和水平都一届超过一届。然而，本届大学生运动会却历经坎坷，差一点“泡汤”了。
    这届运动会几年前就选定在巴西第一大城圣保罗举行，该市也一直努力筹备着。可是到了去年年底，圣保罗市突然提出因经费等问题，放弃主办权。当时距离开幕之日只剩半年多时间，这可急坏了以内比奥罗为首的国际大学生体联，他们四处联系接办运动会的地点。时间一天一天过去，谁都不愿接，连设施齐全、刚办完奥运会的汉城也不接。
    国际奥委会主席萨马兰奇在关键时刻出马帮助做工作。到了3月底，西德杜伊斯堡市终于伸出援助之手，同意接办这届运动会，并如期举行。杜伊斯堡是个只有40万人口的小城，位于莱茵河畔。该市之所以肯接办，据说重要原因之一是，给国际体育界留下好印象，为杜伊斯堡所在的鲁尔地区争办2000年或2004年奥运会创造条件。
    世界大学生运动会通常有10个或11个竞赛项目。本届大学生运动会仅有4个多月的筹备时间，比赛项目不得不减为4个（篮球、田径、赛艇、击剑）。尽管如此，运动会规模仍不小。最近内比奥罗宣布，已有81个国家和地区报名参加，估计运动员人数达2000—2500人左右。有一批世界级好手将会参赛，篮球比赛水平很可能是历届最高的。
    由于美国多数优秀运动员均属于大学，因此美国大学生体育代表团比奥运会选手团水平不会差多少。加上去年奥运会输给苏联和民主德国后，美国人很不甘心。本届运动会将是他们重振雄风的一个机会。
    本届运动会组委会正在克服困难，有条不紊地展开筹备工作。比赛赛场全部利用原有场馆。场地条件还算可以。但几千人的食宿将是个大问题。杜伊斯堡城市小、大旅馆少，多数运动员将分散住在该城周围，这又将带来交通问题。至于经费，除联邦政府答应提供300万马克外，其余主要靠从鲁尔地区筹集。组委会的总预算为1000万马克，这点钱显然太少了，要知道1991年英国设菲尔德下一届世界大学生运动会的预算约为二亿三千万马克。
    看来，富裕的德国人在办这届运动会时肯定将精打细算，一分钱掰成两半花。
