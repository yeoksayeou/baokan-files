After suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing and stopping the turmoil in other places, under the call of the Party's policy and the deterrence of national laws, many criminals have surrendered themselves. Some have also exposed and reported on other criminals. Their expressions of guilt and repentance, as well as their efforts to redeem themselves, will or have already been given lenient treatment by the judicial authorities.

Punishment combined with leniency is the basic policy of our Party and state in handling all criminal offenders. Currently, in dealing with counter-revolutionary elements and other criminal offenders involved in the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots according to law, we must firmly adhere to this policy. On one hand, those who planned, organized, and directed the riots and turmoil, the core members of various illegal organizations, and those who engaged in serious acts of beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing, which severely endangered social order, and other serious criminal offenders, must be promptly and severely punished according to law. On the other hand, those who voluntarily surrender themselves, truthfully confess their illegal and criminal acts, and have the legal circumstances of lenient or mitigated punishment, such as exposing and reporting on other criminals, must be given lenient treatment according to law.

By "surrendering," it is meant that the criminal must do three things: first, voluntarily surrender; second, actively confess the crimes; third, accept the investigation and judgment. These three points are indispensable. Some criminals, although they voluntarily surrendered, avoided the serious aspects when confessing their crimes, or hid major crimes, or adopted tactics of stubborn resistance when being investigated, and were unwilling to confess their accomplices. Such so-called "surrendering" is actually out of helplessness and not a genuine desire to confess.

By "confessing," it is generally meant that after committing a crime, the criminal's illegal acts have been suspected or detected by the political and legal authorities or the organization of the unit. When the public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs summon or detain them, or when the unit organization summons them, they truthfully confess their crimes, especially those crimes that the public security and judicial organs did not previously have in their possession. The difference between confessing and surrendering lies in the fact that confessing does not have the circumstances of voluntarily surrendering, actively confessing crimes, and voluntarily accepting punishment, and the degree of guilt and repentance is different. Confessing and admitting also have strict distinctions. After a criminal is arrested, when faced with conclusive evidence, they are forced to admit and confess their crimes, which is an admission, not a confession.

When criminals surrender themselves and truthfully confess their crimes, and also expose and report on the major crimes of other criminals, which, after verification, are proven to be true, thus helping to solve other major cases, or assisting the public security and judicial organs in apprehending other criminals, this is considered meritorious.

Currently, some criminals do not fully understand the Party's policies and national laws, and are still hesitating, observing, and wavering, without the resolve to confess and surrender. They may doubt whether they can receive lenient treatment because they committed serious crimes, or because they have been detained, re-educated through labor, or imprisoned before, or they regret not surrendering earlier, and now wonder if it is too late to confess. These doubts are unnecessary and harmful. As mentioned above, punishment combined with leniency, or "confess and be lenient, resist and be strict, redeem through merit, and be rewarded for great merit," is the consistent policy of the Party and state in handling all criminal offenders, and is not only applicable to those who commit general crimes, but also to those who commit serious crimes; it is not only applicable to new crimes, but also to crimes that have occurred a long time ago. The Party and government will give all redeemable criminals the opportunity to confess and surrender. If criminals know that their crimes are serious and that hiding them cannot last, they should make a firm decision, act promptly, and confess and surrender as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will miss the opportunity, make repeated mistakes, and suffer the consequences.

Surrendering, thoroughly confessing, exposing and reporting on crimes, and striving for lenient treatment is the only way out for all criminal offenders. Those who still have doubts and have not yet confessed and surrendered should make a quick decision and take this path of repentance and reform.

    坦白自首是犯罪分子的唯一出路
    刘恩启
    在平息北京的反革命暴乱、制止其他一些地方的动乱之后，在党的政策感召和国家法律的威慑下，不少犯罪分子投案自首，有的还揭发检举了其他犯罪分子。他们这种认罪悔罪、立功自赎的表现，必将或已经获得司法机关的从宽处理。
    惩办与宽大相结合，是我们党和国家处理一切刑事犯罪分子的基本政策。当前，在依法处理动乱和反革命暴乱中的反革命分子及其他刑事犯罪分子时，仍然要坚决贯彻这一政策。一方面，对那些制造暴乱、动乱的策划者、组织者和幕后指挥者，各种非法组织的骨干分子和进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀等严重危害社会治安的反革命分子和其他严重刑事犯罪分子，要及时依法从严惩处；另一方面，对于那些自动投案自首、坦白交代违法犯罪行为、有检举立功表现等法定从轻、减轻处罚情节的犯罪分子，则必须依法从宽处理。
    所谓自首，是指犯罪分子必须做到三点：第一，自动投案；第二，主动交代罪行；第三，接受审查和裁判。这三点缺一不可。有些犯罪分子虽然主动投案了，但交代罪行时避重就轻，或隐匿重大罪行，或对审查采取软磨硬顶的办法，不肯交代犯罪同伙。这些人的所谓“自首”，实际上是出于无奈，并非真的想主动认罪。
    所谓坦白，通常是指犯罪分子作案后，其犯罪行为已被政法机关或单位组织怀疑、察觉，在公检法机关对其传询、拘留，或单位组织找其传话后，如实交代了自己的罪行，尤其是交代了公安司法机关事先没有掌握的罪行。坦白和自首的区别，在于坦白不具备自动投案、主动交代罪行、自愿接受处理等自首情节，在认罪悔罪程度上不同。坦白和供认也有严格的区别，罪犯被逮捕以后，在确凿的证据面前，被迫承认并交代了自己罪行的，属于供认，不是坦白。
    犯罪分子在投案自首以后和坦白交代的过程中，不仅如实交代了自己的罪行，而且揭发检举了其他犯罪分子的重大罪行，经查证属实，从而得以侦破其他重大案件，或者协助公安司法机关缉捕其他罪犯的，属于立功。
    现在，还有一些犯罪分子对党的政策和国家法律不甚了解，还在犹豫、观望、徘徊，没有下决心坦白自首。他们或者因为自己犯罪较重，或者因为过去曾被拘留、劳教、劳改过，而怀疑能否得到宽大处理；或者懊悔未能及早出来自首，现在坦白交代是否为时已晚。这些疑虑都是多余的和有害的。如上所述，惩办与宽大相结合，或曰“坦白从宽，抗拒从严，立功赎罪，立大功受奖”，是党和国家受理一切刑事犯罪分子的一贯政策，并不是只有对一般罪行的犯罪分子适用，对罪恶重大的犯罪分子就不适用；也不是只对新的犯罪适用，对时过已久的犯罪就不适用。党和政府是会给一切可挽救的犯罪分子以坦白自首的机会的。犯罪分子既然知道自己罪恶深重，知道隐瞒总是不能持久，就更应该痛下决心，当机立断，及早坦白自首。否则，就是坐失良机，一误再误，自食恶果。
    投案自首，彻底坦白、检举立功，争取从宽处理，是一切刑事犯罪分子的唯一出路。还在心存疑虑、尚未坦白自首的犯罪分子，都应迅速抉择，走这条悔改自新之道路。
