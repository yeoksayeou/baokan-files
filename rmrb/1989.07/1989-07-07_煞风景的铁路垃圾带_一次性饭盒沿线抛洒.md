Title: The Unsightly Railway Garbage Belt: Disposable Foam Boxes Scattered Along the Tracks

    During the operation of trains, passengers often throw away melon rinds, fruit shells, cigarette packs, bottles, and various food bags and packaging paper out of the windows. Even if they throw them on the floor of the car, they are still swept out by the attendants to the sides of the railway. Over time, a garbage belt has formed on both sides of the railway.

    In recent years, this garbage belt has added a new member: disposable foam plastic lunch boxes used on trains.

    Recently, the author conducted a random survey on the railway section of Pudian Village, Weiting Town, Wuxian County, Suzhou. In an area approximately 9 meters wide (including the protective forest belt and ditch) and 110 meters long (146 steps), there were a total of 1035 foam lunch boxes, with a density of about one box per square meter. Among them, the density in the protective forest was higher than in the ditch. In the approximately 5-meter-wide forest belt, there were 700 lunch boxes. Because the material of these lunch boxes does not decompose easily, they do not "renew" like melon rinds and fruit shells, but only accumulate day by day. Moreover, due to their white and eye-catching color, and their ability to float on water, they cause the railway sides and water surfaces to appear dirty and messy.

    Currently, the use of foam lunch boxes on trains is on the rise. If this continues, the density of lunch boxes in the garbage belt will continue to increase, and one day, a white garbage belt will form on both sides of the railway.

    To protect the sanitation of the railway sides, the author appeals to the railway department to take this as a warning. First, they should promote and discourage passengers from throwing garbage out of the windows, encouraging civilized travel; second, train attendants should not directly sweep the garbage onto the railway, but should clean it up and collect it in garbage bags, and then throw it into the garbage bins at the station when the train arrives; in addition, relevant departments should also start paying attention to the collection and recycling of old and waste materials.

    In summary, the station should work closely with the train to jointly promote civilized travel and maintain the sanitation of the railway environment.

### 煞风景的铁路垃圾带  一次性饭盒沿线抛洒

    煞风景的铁路垃圾带
    一次性饭盒沿线抛洒
    列车运行途中，旅客常将瓜皮、果壳、烟盒、酒瓶以及各种食品袋、包装纸等废品直接抛向窗外，即使丢在车厢地板上，也还是被乘务员在清理时从车厢门口扫向铁路两旁。久而久之，铁路两侧已形成一条废品垃圾带。
    近几年，这个垃圾带上又增加了一个新成员，即列车上用餐的一次性泡沫塑料饭盒。
    笔者最近偶然在苏州吴县唯亭镇浦田村铁路段做了一个抽样调查，在宽约9米（防护林带加水沟），长约110米（146步）的地带上，共计有1035只泡沫饭盒，密度已达到每平方米一只。其中，防护林中的密度比水沟高，在约5米宽的林带内，分布有700只饭盒。由于这种饭盒的材料不易腐烂，因而不像瓜皮、果壳等其他废品那样“新陈代谢”，而只能是日益积累。并且由于其颜色雪白显眼，加上其浮水的特点，造成了铁路两侧地带及水面的脏乱环境。
    目前，泡沫饭盒在列车上使用方兴未艾，这样下去，垃圾带上饭盒的密度将不断增加，终有一天将在铁路两侧，形成白色的垃圾带。
    为保护铁路两侧的环境卫生，笔者呼吁铁路部门引以为戒，首先要宣传、劝阻旅客不要向窗外乱扔废物，文明乘车；其次，列车员也不应将垃圾直接扫向铁路，而应打扫集中，装入垃圾袋，当列车进站后，再丢入车站的垃圾箱；此外，有关部门也应开始重视收旧利废工作。
    总之，车站应与列车密切配合，共同为促进文明乘车、维护铁路环境卫生而努力。
