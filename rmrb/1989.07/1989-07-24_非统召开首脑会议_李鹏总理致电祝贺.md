The Non-Aligned Movement's 25th Summit of Heads of State and Government was held. Premier Li Peng sent a telegram to congratulate the summit. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

Addis Ababa
Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity:

On the occasion of the 25th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, I extend, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, warm congratulations to the summit.

We are pleased to see that since the last summit of the OAU, the overall situation in Africa has continued to be conducive to peace and development in Africa. The independence of Namibia is in sight, and the day when the entire continent of Africa will be completely liberated is not far off. This is the result of the long-term joint struggle of the African countries and peoples and the OAU. A united, cooperative, and continuously developing Africa will certainly make increasingly important contributions to promoting world peace and the progress of mankind.

China and African countries have always sympathized with, understood, and supported each other, whether in joint struggle or in times of difficulty. The deep friendship and close cooperative relationship that already exist between China and Africa have withstood the test of storms. I wish to reaffirm here that the Chinese government will continue to adhere to the established policy of strengthening solidarity and cooperation with African countries. As always, we will resolutely support the African countries' just struggle to maintain national independence and legitimate rights and to oppose the apartheid system. We will also resolutely support the efforts of the OAU to promote South-South cooperation and North-South dialogue.

I believe that this summit will surely fulfill the mission entrusted to it by the African countries and peoples, and make new contributions to further strengthening the unity of African countries and promoting the political and economic situation in Africa in a more favorable direction.

Li Peng
Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China

    非统召开首脑会议
    李鹏总理致电祝贺
    新华社北京7月24日电　国务院总理李鹏今天打电报给非洲统一组织第25届国家元首和政府首脑会议，热烈祝贺会议的召开。电报全文如下：亚的斯亚贝巴非洲统一组织国家元首和政府首脑会议：
    在非洲统一组织第二十五届国家元首和政府首脑会议召开之际，我谨代表中国政府和人民向会议致以热烈的祝贺。
    我们高兴地看到，自上届非统首脑会议以来，非洲大陆总的形势继续有利于非洲的和平与发展。纳米比亚独立在望，整个非洲获得彻底解放的日子已为期不远了。这是非洲国家和人民以及非统组织长期共同斗争的结果。一个团结、合作和不断发展的非洲必将为促进世界和平和人类进步事业做出日益重要的贡献。
    中国和非洲国家不论是在共同斗争中还是在遇到困难时，总是互相同情、互相理解和互相支持。中国和非洲业已存在的深厚友谊和密切的合作关系是经得起风浪考验的。我愿在此重申，中国政府将继续遵循不断加强同非洲国家的团结与合作的既定政策，一如既往地坚决支持非洲国家维护民族独立和国家合法权益以及反对种族隔离制度的正义斗争，坚决支持非统组织为推动南南合作和南北对话而做出的努力。
    我相信，本届首脑会议一定能够胜利完成非洲国家和人民赋予它的使命，为进一步加强非洲各国的团结、推动非洲政治、经济形势向着更有利的方向发展做出新的贡献。
    中华人民共和国国务院总理　李　鹏
