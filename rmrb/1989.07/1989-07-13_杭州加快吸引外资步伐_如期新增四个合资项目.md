In the past month and a half, Zhejiang Province's Hangzhou City has signed four joint venture projects with foreign investors as scheduled, with a total investment of $8.13 million. This is an increase of 1.5 times compared to the total amount of joint venture projects signed in the first five months of last year.

Due to the impact of unrest and riots in some parts of the country, foreign managers and technical personnel of some "three-resource" enterprises in Hangzhou have successively returned to their home countries, and some foreign-invested projects that were about to be negotiated and signed have been suspended due to issues on the foreign side. During this period, Hangzhou City held several symposiums for Chinese and foreign managers of "three-resource" enterprises, with the mayor directly engaging in dialogue with representatives of "three-resource" enterprises to dispel doubts. To promptly address the difficulties faced by "three-resource" enterprises in terms of energy, raw materials, and funds, the Hangzhou Foreign Investment Enterprise Association actively facilitated connections, with the Municipal Cooperation Office responsible for providing over 40 urgently needed materials.

    杭州加快吸引外资步伐
    如期新增四个合资项目
    本报杭州电　记者高海浩报道：在过去的一个多月里，浙江省杭州市又与外商如期签订了4个合资项目，总投资达813万美元，比去年1至5月签约的合资项目总额增加1.5倍。
    由于受到国内部分地区动乱和暴乱的影响，杭州市有关“三资”企业的外方管理和技术人员相继回国，有些准备洽谈签约的外资项目也因外方原因被迫中止。在此期间，杭州市先后召开“三资”企业中方和外方经理座谈会，由市长直接与“三资”企业代表对话，消除疑虑，为了及时解决“三资”企业面临的能源、原材料和资金等困难，杭州市外商投资企业公会积极牵线搭桥，由市协作办负责提供急需的40多种物资。
