Have you read the poem by the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso? “The green cuckoo, when will you fly to Menyuan? I want to send three messages to the beautiful girl.” Menyuan is his hometown, and he calls it the place where the ducks fly. On the map, Menyuan is west of Bhutan and north of India, the main settlement area of the Menba people in Tibet. It is located on the southern edge of the subtropical zone, with dense forests and a warm, humid climate. Therefore, forestry has become the main pillar of the local economy, and bamboo and wood culture have become a major local characteristic.

It was May, the month of blooming rhododendrons, but it snowed several times here, blocking the mountain passes and roads. We bit the bullet and crossed the Pola Snow Mountain, which is nearly 5,000 meters above sea level, to reach the northern part of Menyuan, Lubu. “Lubu” in Menba language means “the remaining people.” It is said that in the old days, the old government missed this area when counting the Menba population and making administrative divisions, so it was called “Lubu.”

The Niyang River flows from north to south through Lubu, rushing towards the Indian Ocean without stopping. Most of the villages in the four townships of Lubu are scattered in the river valley and forests on the west bank. On the plateau, barley and wheat have sprouted; on the slopes, brown yaks silently lick the tender grass. The winding road winds through the mountains, bringing in food and daily necessities, and taking out various forest products. The output and input of culture make this place no longer a closed-off paradise.

Color (belonging to Gongri Township) is the first Menba village we visited, and it is the hometown of my friend, Deputy Director of the Autonomous Region's Ethnic and Religious Affairs Commission, Cuomu. This makes me feel particularly close to everything in the village. The township party secretary, Gesang, proudly told us: The Menba people of Lubu have crossed the end of the primitive society and entered the socialist era. Advanced production methods have replaced primitive and backward production methods, and “slash-and-burn agriculture” has become history. This township produces enough grain to be self-sufficient, and the state allocates some adjustment grain every year; livestock and forest products are self-sufficient and surplus, and are the main commodities that villagers take to the market for exchange. The annual Zadang and Cona commodity exchange fairs are the most popular. Last year, the per capita net income of the township was 760 yuan.

Gesang is 44 years old and has 15 years of party membership. He participated in the 1962 Sino-Indian border self-defense counterattack. Unexpectedly, his late father was a famous lama in this area, and he himself learned scriptures from his father when he was young, but later changed his beliefs and became a communist warrior. Not long ago, someone advised him to change his allegiance and continue his father's business, but he did not waver. Interestingly, although the father and son have different beliefs, they are both local “spiritual leaders.” Gesang's third son, Doji, is the successor to his father's business. He is the township's youth league secretary and is leading a group of league members and young people to run night schools to eliminate illiteracy. He said: “We feel that the construction of our hometown cannot do without cultural knowledge, so we do this.”

A qualitative change is quietly spreading. This makes me think of another father and son. It was a twilight, and we strolled on the main road in the south of the village. The evening breeze was cool but not cold. We unknowingly entered a house, and the room was clean and tidy. The style of the furniture was also rare in the local area, a combination of Tibetan and Han styles, which we had not seen in the more than ten Menba families we had visited.

Butter tea was served. Since we entered the Lubu Valley, we have been drinking butter tea every day, but the most fragrant was this time. This made us notice the extraordinary host. He is called Guchu, 33 years old, with a handsome face. He is the first batch of students trained by Lubu District Primary School after liberation. He was excellent in both academics and conduct in school, but unfortunately, he did not have the opportunity to continue his studies after graduation. As introduced by others, we learned that he is the township head, and also the accountant and clerk of the township, the local intellectual. It is said that he only graduated from primary school. But those who are truly intellectuals, once they fly out of the small valley, it is not easy for them to return.

Guchu's father, Jiangbailuo, is a 70-year-old illiterate cultural figure—a famous folk singer and heir to Menba opera. He was invited to sing a song, “Sama”: “The sun in the blue sky shines on the earth, illuminating the world, wishing the sun to warm forever. The snow lion stands on the high peak and looks at the world, wishing the lion to be healthy and long-lived…”

“Sama” is a folk song widely spread in the Menba area, and it is said to be on the verge of extinction. Jiangbailuo sang in a low and then high voice. A force deeply moved us. The song stopped abruptly, and the old man seemed to remember a distant era. He raised his head and said: “Singing for friends is meaningful. This song is now only sung by me in the local area.” He said that in the past, the village would sing and dance for every celebration, but now Guchu's generation no longer knows these traditional skills, and instead, there are radios, tape recorders, VCRs, and movies.

These words are shocking and have made me think for a long time. It is undeniable that new cultures, such as agricultural machinery, electric lights, glass windows, pressure cookers, thermos bottles, etc., have been enthusiastically accepted, symbolizing civilization and progress. However, while developing civilization, how to protect the individuality of national culture and how to prevent neglecting one aspect while focusing on another? It seems that there are too few people who pay attention to studying this problem.

Le Village is adjacent to the McMahon Line. There is a humorous forest ranger in Le Village, 63-year-old Guchu Cidan. At a time when environmental issues are becoming increasingly prominent around the world, he also performs his duties in his own way, although he does not understand much ecological theory. He sent all his children to school, and for those parents who let their children drop out of school to farm, he disdainfully called them “short-sighted.”

When leaving Le Village, I felt the weather was particularly pleasant, and I couldn't help but think of the Sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso's poem again. The scene of “ducks flying” seemed to appear before my eyes.

    门隅之北
    本报记者　卢小飞
    不知你是否读过六世达赖仓央嘉措的这首诗？“翠绿的布谷鸟，何时要去门隅？我要给美丽的姑娘，捎去三个讯息。”门隅是他的故乡，他在诗中称那儿是“杜鹃飞来的地方”。
    从地图上看，门隅西毗不丹，北邻印度，是我国西藏境内门巴族的主要聚居区。那里地处亚热带南缘，森林茂密，气候暖湿，于是林业成了当地经济的主要支柱，竹木文化遂成为一大地方特色。
    正是满山杜鹃的5月，这里却连下几场大雪，封住了山口和公路。我们一咬牙，靠两条腿翻过了海拔近5000米的波拉雪山，抵达门隅之北勒布。“勒布”，门巴语为“余下的人”。据说，早年间旧政府在统计门巴人口并进行区划时，漏掉了门隅之北，遂称“勒布”。
    娘曲江从北向南纵穿勒布，不停息地奔向印度洋。勒布区门巴四乡的大部分村子散落于西岸的河谷丛林之中。台地上，青稞、小麦已吐青穗；山坡上，棕色的犏牛默默地舔着嫩草。弯弯曲曲的公路盘山而过，运进来食品和日用百货，带出去各种林产品。文化的输出、输入使这里不再是封闭的世外田园。
    色目（属贡日乡）是我们采访的第一个门巴村，是我的朋友、自治区民族宗教事务委员会副主任措姆的家乡，这使我对村里的一切都感到格外亲切。乡党支书格桑不无自豪地告诉我们：勒布门巴已经渡过了原始社会末期，进入社会主义时代。先进的生产方式已经替代了原始、落后的生产方式，“刀耕火种”已成为历史。这个乡产的粮食可以自给，国家每年还拨给一些调剂粮；畜产品和林产品自给有余，是村民们拿到市场参与交换的主要商品，一年一度的泽当、错那物交会上，来自勒布的竹木器最受欢迎。去年，全乡人均纯收入760元。
    格桑今年44岁，有15年党龄，参加过1962年中印边境自卫反击战。出乎意料，他已故的父亲曾是这一带有名望的喇嘛，他本人小时候从父习经，但后来改变了信仰，成为共产主义战士。前不久，有人劝他改换门庭继承父业，他没有动摇。有意思的是，父子俩尽管信仰不同，却都是地方上的“精神领袖”。格桑的三儿子多吉是继承了父业的，他是乡团支书，正领着一群团员、青年办扫盲夜校。他说：“我们是感受到家乡建设离不了文化知识才这样做的。”
    一种质的变异在悄悄地延伸。这使我想起另一对父子。那是一个黄昏，我们漫步在村南的大路上，晚风清凉而无寒意。我们不觉走入一户人家，室内清雅而整洁，家具式样也是当地所少见的藏、汉风格，这在我们采访的十几户门巴人家里还没有遇见过。
    酥油茶端上来了。进入勒布沟，我们天天喝酥油茶，但最香的要数这一次了。这使我们注意到不同凡响的主人。他叫古如，33岁，眉清目秀，是解放后勒布区小学自己培养的第一批学生。在学校他品学兼优，可惜毕业后没有机会继续深造。听别人介绍，我们才知道他是乡长，兼着乡上会计和文书，是当地的大知识分子。说起来，他才小学毕业。可那些真正的大知识分子，一旦飞出小山沟，便不大可能回来了。
    古如的阿爸、70岁的江白罗追是不识字的文化人——远近闻名的民歌手、门巴戏的传人。他应邀唱了一首《萨玛》：“蓝天上的太阳普照大地，照亮了人间，祈愿太阳永远温暖。雪山狮子站在高峰远望世界，祈愿狮子健康长寿……”
    《萨玛》是门巴地区广为流传的一种民歌曲调，据说已濒临绝迹。江白罗追时而低沉时而高亢。一种力量深深地打动了我们。歌声戛然而止，老人似乎想起了久远的年代。他抬起头说：“给朋友唱歌是有意义的。这种歌现在当地只有我会唱了。”他说，过去村里逢喜庆都要载歌载舞，而现在古如这一代已没有人会这些传统的玩艺儿了，取而代之的是收音机、录音机、录相机、电影。
    这些话令人震惊，引起我长久的思考。不可否认，新的文化，诸如农业机械、电灯、玻璃窗、高压锅、暖水瓶等等已被欣然接受，标志着文明、进步，但在发展文明的同时如何保护民族文化的个性，如何防止顾此失彼？重视研究这个问题的似乎太少了。
    勒村紧靠麦克马洪线。勒村有位风趣的护林员，是63岁的古如次丹。当环境问题在全球日渐突出的时候，他也以其特有的方式恪尽职守，尽管他并不懂多少生态理论。他把孩子一个个都送去读书，对那些让孩子辍学务农的家长，他不屑地称其为“鼠目寸光”。
    离开勒村时，我觉得天气格外怡人，不禁又想起六世达赖仓央嘉措的那首诗，眼前似乎出现了“杜鹃飞来”的如画诗境。
