The "Mayor's Environmental Target Responsibility System" has brought government leaders to the forefront. At the conclusion of the third environmental protection conference in Guizhou Province today, the heads of the governments of Guiyang, Liupan, Zunyi, and Anshun signed environmental protection target responsibility letters with Governor Wang Chaowen and Deputy Governor Liu Yulin, pledging to achieve environmental goals during their terms in office.

The responsibility letters specifically outline the environmental protection goals and tasks for the mayors during their terms, and these will be included as part of their performance evaluations. Rewards and punishments will be given based on the completion of these goals. This system clearly establishes that environmental protection is the responsibility of government leaders at all levels, thereby emphasizing the spirit that governors, mayors, and county magistrates are responsible for the environment in their respective regions.

"In the military, there are no empty words; we are willing to sign military orders." The four mayors expressed at the signing ceremony that after signing the orders, they will accept evaluations and will not disappoint the people. One mayor said: For the 20 evaluation indicators specified, we will treat them as seriously as controlling the rise in the price index. Upon returning, we will work to coordinate the relationships between various departments in environmental protection, ensuring that the task of improving environmental quality is implemented at all levels.

This signing of responsibility letters by mayors to the governor is an important part of the provincial government's efforts to establish a new order for environmental protection work in Guizhou. Next year, this will be extended to all cities and counties in the province, gradually making environmental comprehensive treatment target-oriented, quantitative, and institutionalized, fundamentally solving the increasingly serious problem of environmental pollution.

    环保非小事　军中无戏言
    贵州四市长立“军令状”
    保证任期内达到环保目标决不失信于民
    本报贵阳7月22日电　记者胡跃平报道：“市长环境目标责任制”把政府负责人推向了前台。在今天结束的贵州省第三次环保会上，贵阳、六盘水、遵义和安顺4城市政府负责人分别与省长王朝文、副省长刘玉林签订了市长任期内的环境保护目标责任书。
    责任书具体规定了市长在任期内的环保目标和任务，并作为政绩考核内容之一，根据完成的情况给予奖惩。这项制度明确了保护环境不是哪个部门的责任，而是各级政府负责人的责任，从而体现了省长、市长、县长要对本地区环境负责的精神。
    “军中无戏言，愿立军令状”。4位市长在签字仪式上表示，立下军令状后，就要接受考核，决不失信于民。一位市长说：对所规定的20项考核指标，要像控制物价指数上涨那样来认真对待。回去后，着手理顺各个部门在保护环境方面的关系，使改善环境质量的任务得到层层落实。
    这次市长向省长签订责任书，是省政府作为建立贵州环境保护工作新秩序的一个重要内容，明年将推向全省各市、县，逐步使环境综合整治做到目标化、定量化和制度化，从根本上解决日趋严重的环境污染问题。
