	Beijing's Infectious Disease Incidence Rate Declines

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 22nd - (Reporter ZHU Yu) A responsible person from the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau recently announced that Beijing's infectious disease incidence rate is stable and showing a downward trend, but the potential factors for outbreaks have not been completely eliminated.

	As of mid-June, the cumulative total number of reported infectious disease cases in Beijing has decreased by 21.85% compared to the same period last year. Among these, cases of dysentery have decreased by 34.6%, hepatitis by 21%, and measles, typhus, and meningitis have also decreased compared to the same period last year.

	During the period of turmoil and riots in Beijing, epidemic prevention work was seriously disrupted. To ensure the health of residents and troops enforcing martial law, the Beijing Municipal Epidemic Prevention System strengthened supervision of food hygiene, disinfection of drinking water, and treatment and isolation of infectious disease patients. Currently, epidemic prevention personnel are closely monitoring the occurrence of infectious diseases.

    北京传染病发病率下降
    新华社北京7月22日电　（记者朱玉）北京市卫生局负责人日前宣布，北京传染病发病率稳中有降，但发生疫情的潜在因素仍未彻底消除。
    截至6月中旬，北京市传染病累积总发病报告数比去年同期下降21.85％，其中痢疾下降34.6％，肝炎下降21％，麻疹、斑疹伤寒、流脑也比去年同期减少。
    北京发生动乱和暴乱期间，卫生防疫工作受到严重干扰。为了保证居民与戒严部队官兵的健康，北京市卫生防疫系统加强了对食品卫生的监督、对饮用水的消毒和对传染病患者的治疗与隔离。目前，防疫人员正密切注视着传染病的发生情况。
