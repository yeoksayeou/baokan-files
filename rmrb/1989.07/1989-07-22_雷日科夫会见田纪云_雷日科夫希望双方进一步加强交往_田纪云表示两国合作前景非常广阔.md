Ryzhkov Meets Tian Jiyun
Ryzhkov Hopes for Further Strengthening of Exchanges
Tian Jiyun Says Cooperation Prospects Are Very Broad

MOSCOW, July 22 (Xinhua) — Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov met with Chinese Vice Premier Tian Jiyun at the Kremlin today. The two sides exchanged views on further developing economic and technological cooperation between the two countries.

Ryzhkov said at the meeting that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is a major event in the relations between the two countries. As neighbors and major powers, economic cooperation between the two countries should have a certain scale. The basis for cooperation should be mutual benefit and reasonableness. He hoped that the two sides would further strengthen friendly exchanges.

Tian Jiyun said that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations is of great significance not only to the two countries but also to the overall international situation. In recent years, bilateral relations in the fields of economy, trade, and technology have developed significantly, but there is still much potential to be tapped, and the prospects for cooperation are very broad. He suggested that the two sides focus on several key issues for specific discussions in the future, with areas of cooperation including agriculture, energy, transportation, machinery, light industry, textiles, and labor services.

Tian Jiyun led a Chinese delegation to Moscow on July 20 to attend the fourth meeting of the Sino-Soviet Economic, Trade, and Technological Cooperation Committee.

Soviet Deputy Premier and head of the Soviet delegation to the cooperation committee, Maslyukov, and Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yu Hongliang attended the meeting.

MOSCOW, July 21 (Xinhua) — Soviet Deputy Premier and head of the Soviet side of the Sino-Soviet Economic, Trade, and Technological Cooperation Committee, Maslyukov, hosted a banquet at the Kremlin on the evening of July 21 to welcome Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and the Chinese delegation he led.

Maslyukov said in his speech at the banquet that the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations and the resumption of party-to-party relations are in the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and are conducive to consolidating the positive trends in the current international situation. He emphasized the importance of this meeting and introduced the important resolutions made by the first Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union on developing society. He believed that the Soviet Union has only taken the first step on the road to reform.

Maslyukov pointed out that there is great potential for economic cooperation between the two countries. At present, the two sides are exploring the most promising forms and methods of cooperation and improving the structure of the cooperation committee itself.

Tian Jiyun said in his speech that the recent high-level meeting between the leaders of the two countries undoubtedly gave a new and powerful boost to the development of cooperation in the fields of economy, trade, and technology.

When talking about China's current domestic and foreign policies, he said: "The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government will continue to adhere to the socialist path, implement the policy of reform and opening up, and strive to achieve the four modernizations in our country."

The Chinese delegation led by Tian Jiyun arrived in Moscow on July 20 to attend the fourth meeting of the Sino-Soviet Economic, Trade, and Technological Cooperation Committee. The two sides held their first plenary session this afternoon.
