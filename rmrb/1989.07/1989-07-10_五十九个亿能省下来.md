On December 17 of last year, the People's Daily published an article in the "Today's Talk" column titled "Can 59 Billion Yuan Be Saved?" The article posed a thought-provoking question: Among the 2.5 million freight trucks in the country, 1.6 million are frequently used for long-distance transportation, with an empty run rate of 47.9%. Each year, the losses caused by empty runs amount to 59 billion yuan. This figure is shocking! Half a year later, on June 13, the *Xinhua Daily* reported on page two that the Nan Tong Automobile Transportation Company achieved a loading rate of 95% for both long and short-distance trucks, leading the nation. This report provided a positive answer to whether the losses caused by empty runs can be saved.

The Nan Tong Automobile Transportation Company in Jiangsu Province, with over 280 trucks, previously had a loading rate of only around 70%. A large amount of gasoline and diesel was wasted due to empty runs. Last year, with the increase in fuel prices, the company focused on improving the loading rate of vehicles as a key measure for increasing production and saving resources. They broke away from the single route of running back and forth between two points and formed a large circulation network covering East China, North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. This significantly improved the average loading rate of long and short-distance trucks, saving hundreds of thousands of yuan in gasoline and diesel annually.

The author did some calculations: The trucks owned by the Nan Tong Automobile Transportation Company account for only 0.00175% of the 1.6 million long-distance freight trucks in the country. If all long-distance freight transportation units across the country can learn from the advanced Nan Tong Automobile Transportation Company and increase the loading rate from 52.1% to 80%, an increase of about 27%, then 59 billion yuan can be saved. If the loading rate reaches 95%, an additional 39 billion yuan can be saved, totaling 98 billion yuan.

The author believes that as long as the governments, functional departments, and transportation units at all levels in the country have a sense of urgency and mission, and take concrete actions, they can definitely improve the loading rate of long-distance freight trucks and reduce the empty run rate. This way, not only can significant economic benefits be achieved, but it can also alleviate the tension in transportation and energy, promoting the development of the national economy.

    五十九个亿能省下来
    沈伟民
    去年12月17日，人民日报一版《今日谈》栏目刊登一篇文章：《59个亿能省下来吗？》文章提出一个发人深思的问题：全国250万辆货运汽车中，经常参加长途运输的有160万辆，其中空驶率为47.9％，每年因空驶造成的损失达59亿元。这个数字触目惊心！半年后的6月13日，《新华日报》二版报道：南通汽运公司长短途货车实载率高达95％，在全国领先。这篇报道对汽车空驶造成的损失能否省下来，作出了肯定的回答。
    拥有280多辆货车的江苏省南通市汽车运输公司，以往的实载率只有70％左右，大量的汽油、柴油因车辆放空白白烧掉。去年燃油涨价，这个公司把提高车辆实载率作为增产节约的主要途径来抓，跳出甲乙两地单行往返的线路运输，组成贯穿华东、华北及东北、西北的运力交叉大循环网络，使短、长途货车平均实载率大幅度地提高，全年节约的汽油柴油价值上百万元。
  笔者算了一笔帐：南通汽运公司拥有的货车，仅占全国经常参加长途运输的160万辆货车的万分之一点七五。如果全国长途货运单位都能向先进的南通汽运公司看齐，使货车实载率从52.1％提高到80％，即提高27％左右，59个亿就能省下来；如果实载率都达到95％，则可再节约39亿元，达到98亿元。
    笔者认为，只要全国各省、市、县的政府、职能部门、运输单位，都像南通汽车运输公司这样，多一点紧迫感、使命感，来一点真的、实的，动脑子，抓落实，就一定能够提高长途货运汽车实载率，降低空驶率。这样，不仅能够产生巨大的经济效益，而且可以缓和交通、能源紧张状况，促进国民经济的发展。
