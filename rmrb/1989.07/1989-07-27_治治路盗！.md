    Crack Down on Highway Robberies!

    Since last year, the theft of goods transported by rail in the commercial system of Gansu Province has become increasingly severe. According to a survey by the Commercial Bureau of 20 major units in the system, the value of stolen goods in 1988 reached 1.68 million yuan. In the first quarter of this year, the value of stolen goods has already exceeded 800,000 yuan, more than double the same period last year. The statistics for the second quarter have not yet been compiled, but from the feedback of many units, the theft situation is worsening.

    Materials provided by relevant parties indicate that in recent years, criminals have been increasingly rampant on the railways. They often operate in groups, with upper and lower connections, stealing on a large scale, and even brazenly looting goods. The extent of the damage and the economic losses caused are unprecedented since the founding of the country. According to statistics from these 20 units, out of the 1,163 whole cars shipped in the first quarter of this year, 887 had theft incidents, and even containers were not spared. Stolen goods range from small items like sewing needles and lighters to large items like televisions, refrigerators, whole boxes of bicycles, and whole rolls of fabric. Just one instance, the Lanzhou Power Supply Station, has been robbed five times since last October: 10 boxes of audio tapes sent from Guangzhou were stolen in October; one box (6 units) of bicycles sent from Yulin was stolen in November; one Sharp refrigerator was stolen from a shipment of household appliances sent from Foshan in February; 2 boxes of bicycles sent from Tianjin were stolen in March; and 5 "Jiali" color TVs were stolen in July.

    治治路盗！
    去年以来，甘肃省商业系统经铁路运输的商品被盗情况日趋严重。据商业厅对本系统20个大单位的调查，1988年被盗商品价值达168万元，今年第一季度被盗商品价值已达80余万元，比去年同期上升两倍多。第二季度商品被盗数字尚未统计，但从许多单位反映的情况看，被盗现象有增无减。
    有关方面提供的材料表明，近年来，不法分子在铁路线上进行犯罪活动日益猖獗。他们经常成群结伙，上下接应，大肆盗窃，甚至明目张胆哄抢商品。其祸害面之广，造成的经济损失之大，是建国以来少有的。据这20个单位统计，今年第一季度调入的1163个整车中，有887个发生被盗事故，甚至集装箱也未能幸免。被盗商品，小到缝衣针、打火机，大到电视机、电冰箱、整箱自行车、整件布料。仅兰州交电站一家，去年10月以来已五受盗害：去年10月由广州发来的录音带被盗10箱；11月由玉林发来的自行车被盗一箱（6辆）；今年2月由佛山发来的家电商品，一台夏普电冰箱被盗；3月份由天津发来的自行车有2箱被盗；7月份又有5台“佳丽牌”彩电被盗。交电站的经理们被折腾得焦头烂额。
    路盗不除，祸国殃民。甘肃省商业系统的经理们强烈呼吁各级政府和有关部门采取坚决措施，严厉打击铁路盗贼，保证经济建设的大动脉免受其害。
