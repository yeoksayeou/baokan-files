The Finnish Ministry of Finance recently released an economic situation report emphasizing that the fiscal deficit remains the main problem in Finland's economy. To avoid serious disruptions, Finland must continue to implement economic austerity policies and curb the growth rate of domestic consumption.

Statistics show that in the first half of this year, Finland's private consumption and purchasing power have rapidly increased, particularly in durable consumer goods and housing investments, which have grown too rapidly. Therefore, curbing the growth of consumption has become a key measure to tighten the economy.

Experts believe that the government will also use measures such as increasing indirect taxes like business taxes, reducing public expenditures, and raising interest rates to curb consumption and reduce the deficit.

    芬兰政府强调紧缩经济
    新华社赫尔辛基7月20日电　芬兰财政部最近公布的经济形势报告强调，财政收支逆差仍然是芬兰经济中存在的主要问题。为了避免出现严重干扰，芬兰必须继续实行经济紧缩政策，抑制国内消费的增长速度。
    据统计，今年上半年芬兰私人消费和购买能力迅速上升，特别是耐用消费品和建房投资增长过于迅猛。因而，抑制消费增长成为压缩经济的主要措施。
    专家们认为，政府还将通过增加诸如营业税等间接税收、压缩公费开支和提高利率等手段抑制消费和缩小逆差。
