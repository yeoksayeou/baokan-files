Xinhua News Agency, Mogadishu, July 16th.

According to the latest figures released by Somali police, 23 people were killed and 59 injured in clashes between Muslim protesters and police in the capital Mogadishu on July 14th. This number is double the figure initially released by the Ministry of the Interior two days earlier.

The Somali National News Agency reported today that the police have called on local residents to be vigilant against troublemakers and to support the police in ensuring security.

Somali President Siad Barre has called on the Somali people to maintain peace and avoid actions that harm peace.

Reports indicate that Mogadishu has largely returned to normal today, with only sporadic gunfire. However, the curfew that began on July 14th remains in effect. Diplomatic sources say that approximately 40 Italians, fearing for their safety, have left the city on a military aircraft.
