After Siao Chia-yun was elected as the mayor of Mudanjiang City in Heilongjiang Province, the first "prohibition" he issued was: "Anyone coming with gifts will not be received." Recently, a unit where Siao Chia-yun used to work sent someone to deliver a sack of rice to him. He not only adhered to the "prohibition" himself but also firmly refused to let the person in. He also required his secretary and family members to strictly follow this rule.

Some time ago, the management department of the municipal government sold 5 pounds of fish to each staff member. The leaders of the management department saw that Siao Chia-yun was very busy, so they sent someone to deliver the fish to his doorstep. When Siao Chia-yun's wife saw the person carrying the fish, she quickly closed the door and did not open it.

Some units sent him commemorative items after award ceremonies and celebrations, which were all returned by his secretary. When he went to other counties and grassroots levels to inspect work, he had his secretary pay the meal fees after meals. For commemorative items and gifts from friendly cities and foreign friends, he handed them over to the office for processing. Last autumn, Siao Chia-yun led a municipal government delegation to visit the Soviet Union. The Soviet side presented him with a refrigerator. After returning to the country, he donated this refrigerator to the municipal government kindergarten.

Siao Chia-yun often said: "Our power comes from the people, and we must do our best to serve the people and never abuse our power to do things against the will of the people." He has worked in Mudanjiang for nearly 40 years, and there are many old colleagues, superiors, and subordinates. Some people, after he became mayor, wrote notes, or brought gifts directly to his door, asking him to help solve housing and children's employment issues. Whenever he encountered such situations, he would patiently explain, not sign the notes, and not open the back door. In the more than a year since he became mayor, he has never placed a single person in the government or enterprises. Once, an old colleague who had worked with him for many years came to find him, asking him to help arrange his son in a certain bureau. He asked the person to take the gift away and then patiently said: "I am now the mayor, and speaking or writing notes to get things done has the nature of a command. Others will have difficulties saying no. I often say in meetings that leaders must lead by example in honesty and break the network of relationships. If I am not consistent, what will I say to others in the future?" The person had to give up the original plan.

Recently, the "Beifengyang" refrigerators produced by Mudanjiang Refrigerator Factory are very popular in the market. Some people familiar with Siao Chia-yun came to him, hoping he would write a note to buy a factory price refrigerator. But he always patiently persuaded the visitors and never wrote a single note.

"Contentment with poverty and dedication to the cause is the true nature of a Communist." Siao Chia-yun said. His family of three generations still lives in a two-and-a-half-room house. Last year and this year, the municipal government built houses twice, and according to the conditions, he should be allocated a new house. The housing management department and relevant leaders also did their best to let him move, but he declined. This spring, the leaders of Deyang City, Sichuan Province, visited Mudanjiang and, after learning about Siao Chia-yun's housing situation, said with emotion: "Mayor Siao is truly a man of integrity!"

### 对送礼者概不接待——记牡丹江市市长刁家运

    对送礼者概不接待
    ——记牡丹江市市长刁家运
    刁家运当选为黑龙江省牡丹江市市长后，颁布的第一条“禁令”是“提着礼物来的人概不接待”。不久前，刁家运原来工作过的一个单位，派人给他送去一麻袋大米，他不仅自己遵守“禁令”，硬是把来人拒之门外。他还要求秘书、家属子女协助他严格遵守。
    前些时，市政府机关事务管理局卖给每个职工5斤鱼，管理局的领导看刁家运很忙，就派人把鱼送到他家门口。刁家运的爱人一看来人提着鱼，赶紧又关上大门，硬是没给开门。
    一些单位在奖励会、庆祝会后送给他的纪念品，也都让秘书挡回去了。他到外县和基层检查工作，饭后都让秘书主动交饭费。对友好城市、外国友人赠送的纪念品和礼品，他都交给办公室处理。去年秋天，刁家运率市政府代表团到苏联访问，苏方赠送他一台电冰箱。他回国后，把这台冰箱送给了市政府机关幼儿园。
    刁家运同志常说：“我们的权力是人民给的，要尽全力为人民办事情，绝不能滥用职权干违背民意的事。”他在牡丹江工作近40年，老同事、老上级、老部下很多。一些人在他当市长后，有的写条子，有的直接带礼品找上门来，要求他帮助解决住房和子女的工作等问题。每当遇到这种情况，他都耐心地解释，不批条子，不开后门。他当市长一年多来，从未往机关或企业安插一个人。一次，一位与他共事过多年的老同志来找他，要他帮忙到某局疏通一下，把自己的儿子安排到那里。他让来人先把礼品带走，然后耐心地说：“我现在是市长，说话写条子让人家办事带有命令的性质，人家有困难也不好说。我常在会上讲领导要带头廉洁，要打破关系网，如果表里不一，以后还怎么说别人。”来人只好放弃了原来的打算。
    前段时间，牡丹江电冰箱厂生产的“北冰洋”电冰箱在市场上很受消费者欢迎。一些与刁家运熟悉的人纷纷找他，想让他批个条子，到冰箱厂买个出厂价。但他总是耐心地说服来者，从未批一张条子。
    “安贫乐道，是共产党人的本色。”刁家运这样说。他一家老少三辈至今还住一套两室半的厢房。去年和今年，市政府机关两次盖房，按条件他应分配新房，房管部门和有关领导也做工作让他迁居，可都被谢绝了。今年春天，四川省德阳市的领导到牡丹江访问，了解到刁家运同志的住房情况后，感动地说：“刁市长真是两袖清风！”　（简轩）
