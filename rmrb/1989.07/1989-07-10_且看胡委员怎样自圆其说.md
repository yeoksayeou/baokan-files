Title: Let's See How Hu Jiewu Will Justify Himself

The newspaper reported that during the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress, some committee members criticized Hu Jiewu, a member of the Standing Committee, for entrusting the Four Communications Social Development Research Institute to collect signatures to convene an emergency session of the Standing Committee during the turmoil. This has drawn our great attention. However, after reading Hu Jiewu's "Explanation on the Signature Issue" submitted to the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee on July 3, we felt very disappointed. This "explanation" is actually a defense of his own actions.

However, the defense reveals flaws. From the content of the "explanation," it gives a strong impression that this "explanation" is full of contradictions and cannot justify itself. It seems that without this "explanation," the matter would be clearer, but the more it is "explained," the more confusing it becomes. If you don't believe it, look at the following examples.

In the "explanation," Hu Jiewu complains, "At that time, I did not go out and could not see any situation. I did not know about the posters on the streets or the broadcasts at Tiananmen Square..." It is possible that Hu Jiewu did not go out much during that time, but saying he "knew nothing" about the situation seems not to be the truth. Because in the same "explanation," Hu Jiewu also said, "On the 20th, martial law was declared, and the situation became more severe. I saw students persist in Tiananmen Square, and after the martial law troops entered the city, there was a high possibility of unfortunate incidents. Therefore, I was extremely anxious and worried." If he claims to know "nothing," then from where does his "anxiety and worry" come? This is the first example.

The second example: When explaining why he entrusted the Four Communications Research Institute instead of the Standing Committee's Office to handle the signature collection, Hu Jiewu's reason is that he had a "good impression" of the institute and thought it would be "ideal" to entrust it. Here, the author recalls that earlier, in a "solemn statement" published in the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po, he said, "The Four Communications Social Development Research Institute is a research institution in our country with rich research results." No wonder Hu Jiewu trusted it so much and favored it.

However, a problem arises: Who has ever seen this institute, which has been officially opened for less than half a year and has only five people, produce any decent "research results" (let alone "rich" ones)? Why does Hu Jiewu work so hard to praise this institute in front of the Chinese people and the world? What is the purpose behind this?

The third example: When explaining the reason for entrusting the Four Communications Research Institute to collect signatures, Hu Jiewu also said, "Moreover, at that time, traffic was disrupted, and our office was really unable to carry out the signature collection work." This also raises questions: Since his office was unable to go out due to traffic disruptions, how could the Four Communications Research Institute not be affected? The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is the highest authority in the country. Its office is unable to operate due to traffic disruptions, but a small private research institute has such great power to complete such a large task in that extremely difficult situation? What is the relationship between this institute and the people who caused the traffic disruptions at that time? How did Hu Jiewu know about their tacit understanding and cooperation, and intentionally use it?

The fourth example: On June 26, during the discussion of the relevant signature issue at the vice-chairman's office meeting of the Education, Science, Culture, and Health Committee of the Standing Committee, some committee members mentioned that the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po's "correction" on May 31 buried a nail, saying that the agenda to remove Li Peng was based on the opinions of some standing committee members, which is slandering the committee members. Regarding this, Hu Jiewu refuted, "Perhaps some committee members want to remove Li Peng." Everyone knows that Hu Jiewu is a person with decades of experience in news work. He should not forget the serious criticism of "empty talk" during the Yan'an Rectification Movement. How can he use "perhaps" as the basis for news? If the truthfulness of news can allow so-called "reasonable imagination" or "arbitrary addition," what is the difference between this and the "fabricated" method? What secret does Hu Jiewu have here that we believe will be clarified through investigation.

Repairing the east wall to patch the west wall, but before the west wall's hole is plugged, a new gap appears on the east wall. The Chinese people hope that Hu Jiewu will respect the facts and speak according to the true nature of the matter. This is the only correct attitude of a materialist.

    且看胡委员怎样自圆其说
    孙理
    报纸登载，七届全国人大常委会第八次会议的一些委员在发言中，对人大常委会委员胡绩伟同志在动乱过程中委托四通社会发展研究所征集签名，要求召开人大常委会紧急会议一事，提出了严肃批评，引起我们很大的关注。可是，我们读了见诸报端的胡绩伟同志7月3日向人大常委会第八次会议送交的“关于签名问题的说明”，却感到很失望。这个“说明”，实际上是在为自己的行为作辩解。
    然而，辩解中却露出了破绽。从“说明”的内容看，给人留下了这样的强烈印象：这份“说明”多有自相矛盾、不能自圆其说之处，当真是不加这番“说明”，事情倒还明白一些，越“说明”反而越不明白了。谓予不信，且看下列几例。
    在“说明”中，胡委员叫苦说：“当时我没有出门，也看不到任何情况，对当时街上贴的传单和天安门的广播都不知道……”胡委员那段时间较少出门可能是事实，但说对什么情况他“都不知道”，怕就不是实情了。因为就在同一个“说明”里，胡委员又说：“20日宣布戒严，形势更为严峻，我见学生在天安门坚持不退，戒严部队入城以后，很可能发生不幸事件，因而，我焦急万分，忧心如焚。”既云一切“都不知道”，“忧心如焚”也者，所为何来，从何谈起？此为例一。
    例二：在说明为什么委托四通研究所而不委托人大常委办公厅来办理征集签名时，胡委员的理由是，他对该研究所的“印象是比较好的”，因而认为委托它“比较理想”。这里，笔者记起了早些时候，他在香港《文汇报》发表的“郑重声明”说过的一句话：“四通社会发展研究所是我国一个富有研究成果的机构”。这就无怪胡委员对它如此信任、倍加青睐了。
    但是紧跟着却来了一个麻烦：有谁曾经在哪里见到这家正式开张不过半年的只有5个人的研究所有过哪一点点像样的“研究成果”来着（更不要说“富有”）？胡委员硬要这般起劲为它捧场叫好，为何不拿出一两条根据来呢？以胡委员的理论素养而论，应该是不至于闹到好歹、多寡莫辨的地步的。胡委员这般花气力在国人、世人面前为这家研究所抹涂脂粉，又究竟是为了什么？
    例三：在说明委托四通研究所征集签名的缘由时，胡委员还说：“再说当时交通受阻，我们办公室实在无法进行签名的征集工作。”这也叫人纳闷：既然他的办公室外出交通受阻，四通研究所为什么竟能不受阻？人大常委会是国家最高权力机关，它的办事机构办事交通受阻，一个小小的民办研究所却为何有那样大的神通，能在当时那种非常情况下高速度办成那样大的事？这家研究所同当时使交通受阻的那伙人究竟是什么关系呢？胡委员又是怎样知晓了他们之间的默契、配合关系，并且有意加以利用的呢？
    例四：6月26日，人大常委会教科文卫委员会副主任办公会议讨论有关签名问题时，有的委员谈到，香港《文汇报》在5月31日的“更正”中埋下钉子，说罢免李鹏的议程是根据部分常委意见，这是给委员栽赃。对此，胡委员反驳说：“也许确有部分委员要罢免李鹏呢。”大家知道，胡委员是一位有几十年新闻工作经验的人，他当然不会不知道新闻只能以事实为依据，不至于忘记延安整风时期对“客里空”的严肃批评，他怎么能把“也许”的猜测作为新闻的根据呢？新闻真实性如果能够容许所谓“合理想象”或者“任意添加”，那同“莫须有”的手法又有什么两样？胡绩伟委员在这里有什么隐秘难言之处，我们相信经过调查是一定会搞清楚的。
    拆了东墙补西墙，西墙的窟窿还没有堵住，东墙上又露出了新的漏洞。国人期望着胡绩伟委员能够尊重事实，按照事情的本来面貌讲话。这是唯物主义者唯一正确的态度。
