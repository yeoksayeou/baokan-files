Forest fires have broken out in four locations in France, with thousands of hectares of forest reduced to ashes. Our correspondent Zhang Qi Hua reports from Paris: After a forest fire near Bordeaux in southwestern France, similar disasters have occurred in central and southern regions. So far, approximately 8,000 hectares of forest have been destroyed by the fires.

The forest fires began on July 18th.

Over the past few days, with the efforts of firefighters and police, the main areas affected have seen the fires brought under control. However, some forest fires are still spreading. The authorities have deployed seven fire-fighting aircraft, but the fire department has complained that some of their equipment is outdated and needs to be updated.

    这次森林火灾是7月18日开始的。
