Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, July 15th.

Pan Shi County in Jilin Province has implemented a near-relative avoidance system in its county-level government agencies. Since this year, 57 individuals who should have been avoided have been reassigned.

In recent years, some family circles have gradually emerged within the county-level government agencies in Pan Shi County. In some cases, three family members work in the same unit, and in some bureaus, there are as many as 21 officials with familial relationships. This has allowed for the easy spread of improper practices.

This year, Pan Shi County decided to establish a near-relative avoidance system for officials while formulating anti-corruption measures. The regulations stipulate that officials with spousal relationships, parent-child relationships, in-law relationships, and other close familial relationships cannot work in the same department. The adjustment principles are: lower-ranking officials defer to higher-ranking officials, non-specialized officials defer to specialized officials, and those who can be easily replaced defer to those who cannot be easily replaced.

    磐石县实行近亲回避制度
    新华社长春7月15日电  （通讯员钱曙林）吉林省磐石县在县直属机关实行近亲回避制度。今年以来已有57名应回避对象被调整了工作。
    前些年，磐石县直属机关内逐渐出现了一些亲属圈。有的一家3口在一个单位工作，有的局的干部中，相互有亲属关系的多达21人。这使得不正之风容易滋长。
    磐石县今年在制定廉政措施时，决定建立干部近亲回避制度，规定凡是有夫妻关系、儿女姻亲关系及其他近亲关系的干部，双方不能在同一部门工作。调整原则是：低职务的服从高职务的，专业不对口的服从对口的，调整后易补充的服从不易补充的。
