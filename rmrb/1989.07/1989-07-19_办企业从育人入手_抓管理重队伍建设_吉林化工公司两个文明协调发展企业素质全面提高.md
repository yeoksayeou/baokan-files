In the recent turmoil, one of the country's top ten enterprises, Jilin Chemical Industry Company, with 117,000 employees, maintained an attendance rate of over 97%. No one took to the streets to protest; among the ten production plants and several thousand workstations, not a single one stopped production. The 38 schools did not have a single class suspended, and the production and living order in the chemical city remained stable. In the first half of this year, despite the turmoil and difficulties in raw materials, funds, electricity, and transportation, the company achieved a production value of 1.64 billion yuan, a 2.4% increase over the same period last year, and realized a profit and tax of 728 million yuan, a 10.94% increase.

Why is Jilin Chemical's situation so good? At a recent meeting held by the Jilin Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government to learn from Jilin Chemical's experience, attendees believed that Jilin Chemical's basic experience is its long-term adherence to the simultaneous development of the two civilizations, starting from ideological work to comprehensively improve the enterprise's quality, and striving to build a modernized socialist enterprise with Chinese characteristics through hard work.

Focusing on ideological work is key to consistency. Over the years, Jilin Chemical has combined reform with education, enterprise management with team building, and carried out these efforts simultaneously. Since 1985, the Jilin Chemical Company Party Committee has, in line with the enterprise's development tasks at different times and the actual situation of the employees, determined a theme for ideological education and carried out "main melody" ideological education activities. In 1986, the company launched the "I Love Jilin Chemical" education campaign, guiding employees to summarize and practice the enterprise spirit of "unity, progress, and hard work" and the Jilin Chemical style of "strict, meticulous, practical, and fast." This year's "Carrying Forward the Jilin Chemical Spirit, Deepening Reform, and Being the Master" activity uses the party's basic line to unify thinking and further establish the employees' sense of ownership in the reform. The "main melody" ideological education activities over the past five years have formed a "five-part series" for cultivating Jilin Chemical people, maintaining the continuity of ideological work, and improving the employees' spiritual outlook year by year.

Jilin Chemical pays attention to implementing effective ideological work, guiding employees to focus on their jobs, master first-class skills, and create first-class results. The quality of work at the sewage treatment plant directly affects the health of the people living downstream of the Songhua River. Through discussions on the topic "What if I lived downstream of the Songhua River," they enhanced their sense of social responsibility, thinking of the downstream while living upstream, and doing everything possible to improve the quality of sewage treatment, which was praised by the downstream government and people. Over the years, Jilin Chemical has summarized and established over 1,600 advanced examples of ideological work that are both strong in thought and action. These examples have become living textbooks for ideological work, forming "Youth Achievement Report Teams," "Women Workers' Typical Achievement Report Teams," and "Jilin Chemical Spirit Lecture Teams," which have given over 60 performances throughout the company, with an audience of over 40,000.

The leaders at all levels of Jilin Chemical pay attention to setting an example, consciously placing themselves under the supervision of the masses, acting with authority, speaking with influence, and effectively carrying out ideological work. Over the years, Jilin Chemical's leaders at all levels have insisted on "five opennesses" and "three strictnesses," that is, openness in housing allocation, promotion, recruitment, bonus distribution, and school enrollment; strictness in requirements, supervision, and discipline. The staff representatives once conducted a survey of the housing conditions of over 300 leaders at the factory and department levels, and the results showed that 85% of them were below the standard, with none exceeding the standard. Jilin Chemical's economic benefits have grown rapidly in recent years, realizing a profit and tax of about 10 billion yuan each year. The profit and tax paid in the previous two years increased by 19.2% each year, far exceeding the contract target, but the actual income of the company's leaders was only about one to two times the average income of workers.

    办企业从育人入手  抓管理重队伍建设
    吉林化工公司两个文明协调发展企业素质全面提高
    本报讯　记者李安达报道：在前段时间的动乱中，全国十大企业之一、有11.7万职工的吉林化学工业公司出勤率都在97％以上，没有人上街游行；十几个生产厂，几千个岗位没一个岗位停产；38所学校没有一个班级停课，化工城的生产生活秩序井然。今年上半年，广大职工排除动乱干扰，克服原材料、资金、电力、运输等多方面困难，全公司产值16.4亿元，比去年同期增长2.4％，实现利税7.28亿元，增长10.94％。
    吉化的形势为什么这样好？在最近吉林省委、省政府召开的学习吉化经验现场会上，到会的同志认为，吉化的基本经验是多年来自觉一贯地坚持两个文明一起抓，从抓思想工作入手全面提高企业素质，艰苦奋斗，努力建设具有中国特色的社会主义现代化企业。
    抓思想工作，贵在坚持一贯。几年来，吉化把改革和育人、抓企业管理和抓职工队伍建设结合起来同步进行。1985年以来，吉化公司党委围绕不同时期企业发展中心任务，结合职工思想实际，确定一个思想教育的主题，开展“主旋律”思想教育活动。1986年，开展了“我爱吉化”的教育，引导职工总结和实践“团结、进取、实干”的企业精神和“严、细、实、快”的吉化作风。今年的“弘扬吉化精神，深化改革做主人”活动，用党的基本路线统一思想，在改革中进一步树立职工的主人翁意识。五年来的“主旋律”思想教育活动，构成了培养吉化人的“五部曲”，形成了思想工作的连贯性，职工的精神风貌一年一个新台阶。
    吉化注意把有效的思想工作落实，引导职工立足本职工作，练就第一流的本领，创造第一流的成绩。污水处理厂工作质量的好坏，直接关系到松花江下游人民的身体健康。他们通过开展“假如我住在松花江下游”的讨论，增强了社会责任感，身居上游，想着下游，千方百计提高污水处理质量，受到了下游政府和人民的好评。几年来吉化总结、树立思想工作双过硬的先进典型1600多名。这些典型成了思想工作的活教材，先后组成了“青年事迹报告团”、“女工典型事迹报告团”、“吉化精神讲演报告团”，在全公司巡回演讲60余场，听众达4万多人次。
    吉化各级领导干部注意以身作则，自觉地把自己置于群众监督之下，办事有威信，说话有力量，思想工作也有效。几年来，吉化各级干部都坚持做到“五公开”、“三从严”，即住房分配、晋职晋级、招工聘干、奖金发放、招生就学实行公开；要求从严、监督从严、执纪从严。职工代表曾对公司300多名厂、处级以上领导干部的住房进行过一次调查，结果有85％的人低于规定标准，没有一个超标准。吉化的经济效益这几年增长较快，每年实现利税10亿元左右。前年和去年上缴利税都以每年递增19.2％速度上升，大大超过承包指标，但公司一级领导干部的实际收入只超过工人平均收入一倍左右。
