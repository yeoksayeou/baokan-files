Liu Ri, the Secretary of the Wuxi County Committee in Hebei Province, is known for his integrity, diligence, and love for the people, and is highly regarded throughout the county.

"I Need to Be Vigilant When Alone"

One winter evening in 1987, Liu Ri was at home seeing off two visiting officials. Suddenly, he noticed several baskets in the shady corner of the courtyard. Upon opening them, he found five baskets of oranges, apples, and pears, along with a box of wine and five packs of cigarettes. It was clear that these items were left by the officials who had just visited.

Liu Ri has always refused to accept gifts, and this time was no exception. The next day, he sent a message to one of the officials: "The items are still in their original place. Please come and take them away." However, a week passed without anyone coming to retrieve them. By then, the oranges had started to rot, so Liu Ri took out 100 yuan to cover the cost of the oranges and had his driver take the items back to the official's home. The official, seeing this, reluctantly accepted 50 yuan according to the market price.

Before the Spring Festival, a former beggar, dressed neatly, came to the county committee to see Liu Ri. Holding Liu Ri's hand tightly, he said excitedly, "It was you who approved the loan for me, a beggar, and now I am a millionaire. I can't be ungrateful." He then took out a wad of money: "This 1,000 yuan is my way of repaying you." Liu Ri quickly stopped him: "No need for that. Supporting you was the right thing to do." The beggar became anxious: "If you don't accept it, you're looking down on me!" He then threw the money on the ground and ran out the door. Liu Ri immediately called the Party Committee Secretary of the office and had the money returned unopened.

Over the past few years, Liu Ri has encountered many instances of people coming to his home to give gifts. Some wanted him to help with job transfers and sent money; others wanted him to help with matters and sent blankets, watches, quartz clocks; still others wanted him to take care of things and sent liquor, roasted duck, large carp... The people involved were colleagues, subordinates, fellow villagers, and classmates, but all were turned away by him and his family. Some people criticized him for not understanding human relationships, but he paid no heed: "The Communist Party doesn't do things this way. I need to be vigilant when alone."

"The Communist Party Seeks to Do Real Work"

Wuxi County is an agricultural county. After Liu Ri took office at the end of 1985, his first task was to plant fruit trees on the riverbank. Some advised him, "Peaches in three years, apricots in four, pears in five. Planting fruit trees takes too long to see results. It's better to focus on some quick and effective projects to show results." He did not heed the advice but instead criticized them: "We cannot, for the sake of short-term glory and excitement, engage in short-sighted behavior. The Communist Party seeks to do real work. As for achievements, the people will have their say."

Liu Ri worked tirelessly to draw up a grand plan to transform the wasteland into an orchard. He visited all 20 townships and over 50 villages in the county, holding meetings at every level, and invited experts from the provincial and municipal forestry bureaus and fruit research institutes to conduct feasibility studies. Everyone worked together, and in one year, 50,000 mu of orchards were established. Fortunately, the weather cooperated with three timely rains, and the fruit tree survival rate reached 90%. The initial victory boosted Liu Ri's confidence and also made the people see that this county committee secretary was not a "Flying Pigeon" (a brand of bicycle known for its durability and reliability).

To explore new paths to prosperity through agriculture, Liu Ri made trip after trip to the provincial capital, inviting experts and technicians from the provincial agricultural academy and agricultural colleges, and went deep into the fields to summarize the "three savings, three highs, six matching" cultivation techniques for wheat and summer corn. Last year, the county's large-scale demonstration of wheat and summer corn yielded 900 jin per mu, increasing the per mu income by 40 yuan. He also vigorously supported the production of greenhouse vegetables, with the county's solar greenhouses reaching over 500 mu, with per mu income exceeding 10,000 yuan. A group of farmers thus escaped poverty and became prosperous.

"One Must Have the People in Mind"

One afternoon, while returning to the county seat, Liu Ri saw a woman with disheveled hair on a bicycle, being held down by someone. He stopped the car and asked, "Hey, fellow villager, what's going on?" "My husband and I had a fight, and she couldn't take it, so she drank some DDT!" "Quick, get on the car and go to the hospital!" Liu Ri got out of the car and helped the woman into the car. "This..." "No problem, saving people is urgent!"

In the emergency room, the doctor mistook Liu Ri for a family member of the patient, calling him to fetch water and get medicine, keeping him busy. Later, someone said to him, "You, as a county committee secretary, should consider your position more. Such small matters don't need your attention." He immediately became angry: "How can the life of the people be a small matter? If you talk about position, we are all Chinese people."

The people of Wuxi County say that Liu Ri is a "people's official." Indeed, he has a special affection for the common people. Before the Spring Festival of 1987, Liu Ri learned from a report that in Su Village, there were three elderly bachelors, all over sixty, who shared one old quilt and had only two bowls of gruel a day.

The next day, despite the strong wind, he personally delivered three quilts to the elderly and called the township and village officials, instructing them, "You must take good care of them, send someone to cook for them, and remember to take them to the doctor." The three elderly men were so moved that they cried and kowtowed to Liu Ri.

A village cadre privately set up a court and beat a villager, causing fractures and concussions, but because some county leaders protected him, the result was that the militia who beat him was arrested, while the village cadre who commanded and personally beat him remained free. Liu Ri heard about this and was furious: "This won't do, the responsibility must be clarified!" Someone tried to stop him: "For one person, it's not worth offending the people in the leadership." Liu Ri slammed his fist on the table: "Does the Communist Party still seek justice?" With his support, the judicial authorities handled the case according to law, sentencing the village cadre to one year in prison.

    严守共产党人的大节
    ——记无极县委书记刘日
    本报记者　杨振武　陈国琦
    河北省无极县委书记刘日，清廉、实干、爱民，在全县有口皆碑。
    “我需要慎独”
    1987年初冬的一个晚上，刘日在家中送走两位来访的干部，突然发现院子背阴处多了几个筐子。打开一看，有桔子、苹果、梨共5筐和一箱酒、5条烟。不用说，是刚才来的人送的。
    刘日从来不收礼，这次也不例外。第二天，他给其中的一位干部捎信：“东西还在原地放着，请赶快拉走。”谁知过了一个星期，也不见有人来拉。这时桔子已开始腐烂，刘日干脆掏出100元顶桔子钱，让司机拉上东西，一同送到那位干部家里。那位干部见状，只好按市价收下50元钱。
    春节前，一位过去有名的流浪汉，穿戴整齐地来到县委看刘日。他紧紧握着刘日的手，激动地说：“当初是您批准给俺这个叫花子贷款，如今俺成了万元户，不能没有良心。”说着从怀里掏出一叠钱：“这1000元是俺报答您的。”刘日慌忙拦住：“快别这样，当初支持你也是应该的。”流浪汉急了：“你不收就是瞧不起俺！”说完，扔下钱就跑出了门。刘日马上叫来机关党委书记，把钱原封退了回去。
    这几年，刘日曾多次遇到过上门送礼的事。有的想托他调动工作，送过钱；有的想求他办事，送过毛毯、手表、石英钟；有的想请他关照，送过名酒、烤鸭、大鲤鱼……出面的人，有的是同事、部下，有的是老乡、同学，但统统被他和家人挡了回去。有人怪他不懂人情事理，他听了却不以为然：“共产党不兴这一套，我需要慎独。”
    “共产党要的是干实事”
    无极县是农业大县，刘日1985年底上任后的第一件事，就是在河滩地上栽果树。有人劝他：“桃三杏四梨五年，栽果树见效太慢，不如抓些短平快的项目，好出成绩。”他没听劝告，反倒一顿批评：“我们不能为了一时的红火热闹，就搞急功近利的短期行为。共产党要的是干实事，至于政绩不政绩，老百姓会有公论。”
    刘日为绘制荒滩变果园的宏图可没少操心。他跑遍全县20个乡，50多个村，层层召开座谈会，又请来省地林业局、果树研究所的专家进行可行性论证，上下一齐动手，一年就建成了5万亩果园。又赶上老天帮忙，三降喜雨，果树成活率竟高达90％。初战告捷，刘日信心倍增，同时也使老百姓看清了：这个县委书记不是“飞鸽牌”的。
    为了探索靠农业致富的新路子，刘日一趟一趟地跑省城，请来省农科院和农业院校的专家、技术人员，又深入田间地头，总结出小麦、夏玉米的“三省三高六配套”栽培技术。去年，全县大面积示范的小麦、夏玉米两茬亩产达到900公斤，亩增效益40元。他还大力扶持温室大棚菜生产，全县日光温室已达500多亩，亩收入在万元以上。一批农民由此而脱贫致富。
    “心里要有老百姓”
    一天下午，刘日在返回县城的途中，见到一辆自行车上带着个披头散发的女人，还被人按着头，停车便问：“哎，老乡，怎么回事？”“俺两口子生气，她想不开，喝滴滴畏了！”“赶紧上车送医院！”刘日跳下来把病人扶进车里，“这……”，“没关系，救人要紧！”
    在医院急诊室，医生误以为刘日是病人的家属，一会儿喊他打水，一会儿又叫他去取药，忙得团团转。事后，有人说他：“你这县委书记太不考虑身份了，这种小事大可不必去管。”他一下子火了：“老百姓的性命怎么能是小事？要说身份，我们都是中国的老百姓。”
    无极县的群众说，刘日当的是“百姓官”。也确实，他对平民百姓别有一番情意。1987年春节前，刘日在听汇报中得知，苏村有父子仨，都是年过花甲的老光棍，三人盖一条破棉被，一天只煮两顿粥喝。
    第二天，他就顶着大风，亲自给老人送去三床被褥，并叫来乡村干部嘱咐道：“一定要照顾好他们，派人给他们做饭，记着给他们看病。”三位老人感动得老泪纵横，直给刘日叩头。
    有个村干部私设公堂，把一个村民吊打成骨折、脑震荡，因为县里有的领导干部庇护，结果，打人的民兵被抓，指挥并亲自打人的村干部却逍遥法外。刘日听说这件事，怒不可遏：“不行，一定要把责任分清！”有人劝阻他：“为一个老百姓，划不着得罪班子里的人。”刘日拍案而起：“共产党还要不要真理？”在他的支持下，司法机关依法办事，判了那位村干部一年徒刑。
