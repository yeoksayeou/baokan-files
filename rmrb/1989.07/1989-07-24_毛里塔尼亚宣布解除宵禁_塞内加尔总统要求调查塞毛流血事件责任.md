Xinhua News Agency, Nouakchott, July 23rd.

According to a statement from the Mauritanian Ministry of the Interior, the curfew in the capital, Nouakchott, has been lifted starting from this morning.

Nouakchott has been under curfew since April 25th this year. Since the beginning of this year, tensions between Mauritania and Senegal have escalated due to conflicts between citizens of the two countries along their borders. This has led to bloody riots where citizens of each country have attacked and expelled the other's residents. Both countries declared curfews or martial law in their respective capitals by the end of April.

Since the deterioration of relations between Mauritania and Senegal, the Organization of African Unity and many African countries have actively mediated. The two countries' ministers of the interior have held multiple talks in a third country, and relations between the two countries have somewhat eased. After Senegal announced the lifting of the curfew, the Mauritanian authorities shortened the curfew time in the capital on June 24th.

The lifting of the curfews by both countries is just the first step towards normalizing relations. Currently, there are still significant disagreements between the two countries regarding the repatriation of each other's citizens, border demarcation, and compensation for property losses. Both sides still need to make efforts and show understanding to restore the traditional friendly and neighborly relations between the two countries.

Xinhua News Agency, Dakar, July 23rd.

Senegalese President Abdou Diouf on July 22nd expressed his hope that the Organization of African Unity would form an investigative committee to visit Senegal and Mauritania to determine the responsibility for the bloody incidents that occurred in April this year. According to information from Libreville, the capital of Gabon, Diouf made this request during a brief visit to Libreville on the 22nd. He was en route to Ethiopia to attend the 25th Summit of the Organization of African Unity.

Diouf said that if the Organization of African Unity cannot form this investigative committee, Senegal will formally request the United Nations to form an international investigative committee.

In April of this year, border conflicts between Senegal and Mauritania led to the expulsion of each other's citizens, causing tensions between the two countries.

### 毛里塔尼亚宣布解除宵禁  塞内加尔总统要求调查塞毛流血事件责任

    毛里塔尼亚宣布解除宵禁
    塞内加尔总统要求调查塞毛流血事件责任
    新华社努瓦克肖特7月23日电　根据毛里塔尼亚内政部的一项公报，首都努瓦克肖特从今天凌晨起解除宵禁。
    努瓦克肖特是从今年4月25日开始实行宵禁的。今年初以来，毛里塔尼亚和塞内加尔由于两国边民冲突，关系渐趋紧张，引发两国部分群众殴打和驱赶对方侨民的流血骚乱事件。毛、塞两国政府于4月底先后宣布在各自首都实行宵禁或戒严。
    毛、塞两国关系恶化后，非洲统一组织和许多非洲国家积极进行调解，两国内政部长在第三国举行了多次会谈，两国关系有所缓和。在塞内加尔宣布取消宵禁后，毛当局也于上月24日缩短了首都的宵禁时间。
    毛、塞先后宣布解除宵禁，只是两国实现关系正常化的第一步。目前，两国在遣返对方侨民、边界划分和赔偿侨民财产损失等问题上仍有很大分歧，要恢复两国间的传统友好睦邻关系，双方仍需作出努力和谅解。
    新华社达喀尔7月23日电 塞内加尔总统阿卜杜·迪乌夫22日希望非洲统一组织组成一个调查委员会赴塞内加尔和毛里塔尼亚调查，以确定今年4月发生的塞、毛两国流血事件的责任。据来自加蓬首都利伯维尔的消息说，迪乌夫总统是在22日晚在利伯维尔提出这一要求的。他在前往埃塞俄比亚出席第25届非统组织首脑会议途中对加蓬进行了短暂访问。
    迪乌夫说，如果非统组织不能组成这个调查委员会，塞内加尔将正式要求联合国组成一个国际调查委员会。
    今年4月，塞、毛两国发生边境冲突，导致两国互相驱赶侨民，致使两国关系紧张。
