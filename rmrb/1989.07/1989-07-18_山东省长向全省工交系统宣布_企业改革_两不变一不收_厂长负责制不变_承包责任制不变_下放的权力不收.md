The governor of Shandong Province, Zhao Zhihua, announced at a recent provincial industrial and transportation work conference that the current factory director responsibility system and the contract responsibility system in enterprises must not be changed, and the powers that have been delegated to enterprises must not be withdrawn.

Zhao Zhihua pointed out that the current task is to study and establish a system of checks and balances on the basis of not changing or withdrawing these reforms, so that these reforms can be further coordinated, improved, and developed.

Shandong Province's proposal of "two unchanged, one not withdrawn" is due to the fact that some places and enterprises have doubts and wavered over the factory director responsibility system and the contract responsibility system while rectifying the errors of Zhao Ziyang.

Deputy Governor Li Chunting said at the meeting that implementing the factory director responsibility system is a major reform of the enterprise leadership system, and the 13th Party Congress and the Enterprise Law have made clear provisions; implementing the contract responsibility system is the most realistic choice for activating enterprises. The practice of more than two years has shown that it has played an important role in developing production, improving efficiency, increasing fiscal revenue, and enhancing the enterprise's momentum.

In order to further coordinate and improve these two reforms, the Shandong industrial and transportation work conference studied and formulated some principles and measures.

In terms of the factory director responsibility system, the main focus is to quickly establish a new system of ideological and political work where the factory director is fully responsible, and the Party, government, trade union, and Communist Youth League work closely together, giving full play to the role of ideological and political work in guaranteeing all aspects of the enterprise's work. In the work, we should insist on combining ideological and political work with production and operation, combining democratic management with rule-based management, combining material incentives with spiritual incentives, and combining responsibility, power, and benefits; Party organizations should, according to the scope of powers stipulated in the Enterprise Law, support the factory director in exercising his powers in accordance with the law, actively do ideological and political work, and focus on Party building, giving full play to the role of the Party organization as a fortress and the vanguard and model role of Party members; trade unions should earnestly carry out their own organizational and institutional construction, and better organize workers to participate in the enterprise's democratic management and supervision.

In terms of the contract responsibility system, the focus is on improving the contract content, doing a good job in benefit distribution, and improving the assessment methods in three aspects, comprehensively using the competition mechanism, benefit mechanism, constraint mechanism, and supervision mechanism. This includes: enterprises whose contract period expires this year can extend the contract period to 1990; actively promote full staff contracting; reasonably use the enterprise's retained profits, strictly implement the distribution ratio of the originally approved production development fund, staff welfare fund, and reward fund, etc.

    山东省长向全省工交系统宣布
    企业改革“两不变一不收”
    厂长负责制不变　承包责任制不变　下放的权力不收
    新华社济南7月18日电  （记者张绥文）山东省省长赵志浩在日前召开的全省工交工作会议上宣布：当前，在企业中实行的厂长负责制不能变，承包经营责任制不能变；已经下放给企业的权力不能收。
    赵志浩指出，现在的问题是，要在不变、不收的基础上，研究建立制衡机制，使这些改革进一步配套、完善和发展。
    山东省提出“两不变一不收”，是因当前一些地方和企业在清理赵紫阳同志的错误时，对厂长负责制、承包经营责任制产生了一些怀疑和动摇。
    副省长李春亭在会上说，实行厂长负责制是企业领导体制的一项重大改革，党的十三大和《企业法》都做了明确规定；实行承包经营责任制是搞活企业最现实的选择，两年多的实践表明，它对发展生产，提高效益，增加财政收入，增强企业后劲，都发挥了重要作用。
    为了使这两项改革进一步配套、完善，山东工交工作会议研究拟定了一些原则和措施。
    在厂长负责制方面，主要是尽快建立起厂长全面负责，党、政、工、团密切配合的思想政治工作新体制，充分发挥思想政治工作对企业各项工作的保证作用。工作中要坚持思想政治工作与生产经营相结合，民主管理与依法治厂相结合，物质鼓励与精神鼓励相结合，责、权、利相结合；党组织要按照《企业法》规定的职权范围，支持厂长依法行使职权，主动做好思想政治工作，全力抓好党的建设，充分发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用；工会要切实搞好自身的组织建设和制度建设，更好地组织职工参加企业的民主管理和民主监督。
    在承包经营责任制方面，重点放在完善承包内容、搞好利益分配、健全考核办法3个方面，综合运用竞争机制、利益机制、约束机制和监督机制。其中包括：今年承包期满的企业可将承包期延长到1990年；积极推行全员承包；合理使用企业留利，严格执行原核定的生产发展基金、职工福利基金和奖励基金的分配比例等。
