Since the reform and opening up, rural cultural rooms and township cultural stations with "four-in-one" activity content have emerged like bamboo shoots after a rain in Guangdong Province. Statistics show that at present, the province has established more than 12,000 rural cultural rooms and 1,750 township cultural stations. Their distinctive feature is to integrate four social functions: conducting ideological education, organizing cultural and sports activities, popularizing scientific and technological knowledge, and transmitting economic information. Locally, they are known as "four-in-one."

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Gaoyao County in western Guangdong, based on the new situation in rural areas, first established cultural rooms (stations) known as "four-in-one." They were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of farmers and grassroots organizations and quickly spread across the province, now covering the entire region. They play an important role in promoting the construction of both material and spiritual civilization in rural areas.
