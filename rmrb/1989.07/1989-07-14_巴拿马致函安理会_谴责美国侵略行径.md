People's Daily, United Nations, July 13th - Correspondent Liú Kāichén reports: Today, Panama's permanent representative to the United Nations, Leonardo Cam, wrote to the President of the United Nations Security Council, "condemning the recent military actions taken by the United States, which violated Panama's sovereignty and territorial integrity."

Cam mentioned that on the morning of July 8th, U.S. military forces stationed in Panama, riding in 31 armored vehicles and protected by 3 helicopters, invaded the Amador region of Panama and occupied it for several hours. A few days earlier, U.S. military forces had also temporarily occupied the surrounding areas of Gamboa Town in Panama.

Cam emphasized that the recent military actions by the United States are part of a plan to militarily intervene in Panama.

Cam concluded by appealing to the U.S. government through the President of the Security Council to correct its erroneous policy of aggression against Panama, and pointed out, "If the U.S. aggression against Panama disrupts peace and security in the region, the responsibility lies entirely with the United States."

    巴拿马致函安理会
    谴责美国侵略行径
    本报联合国7月13日电  记者刘开宸报道：巴拿马常驻联合国代表伦纳多·卡姆今天致函联合国安理会主席，“谴责美国最近采取军事行动，侵犯巴拿马主权和领土完整”。
    卡姆谈到，7月8日晨，驻扎在巴拿马的美国军队乘坐31辆装甲车，在3架直升飞机的掩护下，侵入巴拿马的阿马多尔地区，并占领了数小时。几天前，美国军队还曾一度占领巴拿马的甘博阿镇周围地区。
    卡姆强调，美国最近的军事行为是美国军事干涉巴拿马计划的一个步骤。
    卡姆最后通过安理会主席呼吁美国政府改正其侵略巴拿马政策的错误行径，并指出，“如果美国侵略巴拿马行为破坏了该地区的和平与安全，其罪责完全在于美国”。
