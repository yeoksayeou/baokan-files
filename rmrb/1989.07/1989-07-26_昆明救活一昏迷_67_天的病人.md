Kunming Revives a Patient Who Was in a Coma for 67 Days

According to Xinhua News Agency in Kunming on July 26, (reporter Zhou Dongdi) Kunming Yan'an Hospital anesthesiologist Shen Kun, together with obstetricians and nurses, successfully resuscitated a female patient who had been in a coma for 67 days.

On April 2 this year, 31-year-old Liu Li, an accountant from the Second Machinery Factory in Kunming, underwent a successful cesarean section at Yan'an Hospital and gave birth to a baby girl. Twenty-two hours later, she suddenly experienced severe convulsions, followed by loss of consciousness, and her heartbeat and breathing stopped for 11 minutes. After resuscitation, her heartbeat and breathing resumed, but she remained unconscious. Young anesthesiologist Shen Kun participated in the rescue. Using a simple ventilator, he employed artificial bag ventilation, oxygen supply, blood pressure monitoring, and pulse auscultation to make timely responses and treatments, thus saving the patient's life.
