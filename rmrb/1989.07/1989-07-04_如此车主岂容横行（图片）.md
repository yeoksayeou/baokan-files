Title: Such Drivers Should Not Be Allowed to Run Rampant

There are a significant number of unlicensed passenger tricycles operating in Nanjing. These vehicles are not only in poor condition, but many of the drivers have not received the necessary technical training, and some have poor moral conduct. Look at these drivers (upper photo), they gather in groups, compete for passengers, raise prices, and even fight each other (lower photo), without regard for social order. When they drive, they overload, speed, and recklessly dash through the streets, causing pedestrians to be terrified and try to avoid them at all costs.

Building a civilized city requires service personnel who are law-abiding and civilized. These drivers who run rampant through the streets and alleys need to be managed more strictly.

    如此车主岂容横行
    南京市无营业执照的客运机动三轮车为数不少。这些车辆不仅车况不佳，驾驶车的人员许多没有经过应有的技术培训，有的道德作风不佳。你看，这些车主麇聚一处（上图），争乘客，抬车价，甚至互相大打出手（下图），哪管什么社会秩序。他们驾起车来，超载超速，横冲直闯，路人惊骇，唯恐避之不及。
    建设文明城市，需要有遵纪守法、文明服务的服务人员。对这些横行大街小巷的车主，还是要加强管理。
