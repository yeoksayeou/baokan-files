Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 8th. (Intern Bao Anjun, Reporter Tang Hong) The Chinese Association for Science and Technology held its third session of the thirteenth standing committee today to study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The attendees unanimously supported all the decisions of the plenary session and proposed to strengthen ideological and political education, promote the spirit of "dedication, innovation, pragmatism, and cooperation," and advance the construction of spiritual civilization in the scientific and technological community.

Chairman Qian Xuesen of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. He proposed that in the near future, efforts should be made to organize senior scientists and outstanding middle-aged scientific and technological personnel to use their personal experiences and insights to educate young scientific and technological personnel and students on patriotism and socialism.

The attending standing committee members believed that China has a good scientific and technological team. They said that science and technology are the primary productive forces and also a powerful driving force for the construction of socialist material and spiritual civilization. The vast majority of China's scientific and technological workers are patriotic and adhere to the socialist path. In the growth process of New China, they have formed a relationship of shared hardships and joys with the Party, and therefore are reliable.

At the meeting, the standing committee members also put forward requirements for the specific work of the Association in the future, including continuing to carry out the "Speak of Ideals, Compare Contributions" competition among engineering and technical personnel in large and medium-sized enterprises to promote energy conservation, reduce consumption, and improve product quality; emphasizing academic democracy and resisting the bad academic style of falsification; continuing to strengthen domestic and international academic exchanges among the people, as well as science popularization work.

The third session of the thirteenth standing committee of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology also issued an appeal to all national academic societies, local science and technology associations, and the broad scientific and technological community today, calling on them to stand at the forefront of the construction of socialist material civilization and spiritual civilization, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and strive for socialist modernization.

    中国科协三届十三次常委会强调
    加强科技界思想政治教育
    据新华社北京7月8日电（实习生包安隽、记者唐虹）中国科协今天召开三届十三次常委会，学习、贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神。与会同志一致拥护全会的各项决定，提出要把加强思想政治教育，发扬“献身、创新、求实、协作”的科学精神，来促进科技界的精神文明建设。
    中国科协主席钱学森主持会议并讲了话。他提出，近期内要着重组织老一辈的科学家和优秀中年科技人员，用自己的切身经历和体会，对青年科技人员和广大学生进行爱国主义、社会主义的教育。
    与会常委认为我国有一支很好科技队伍。他们说，科学技术是第一生产力，也是社会主义两个文明建设的强大推动力。我国的绝大多数科技工作者是爱国的，是坚持社会主义道路的，在新中国的成长过程中，他们与党结成了患难与共的关系，因此是可以信赖的。
    会上，常委们还对科协今后的具体工作提出要求，要继续在大中型企业工程技术人员中开展“讲理想、比贡献”的竞赛活动，推动节能降耗、提高产品质量；注意发扬学术民主，抵制弄虚作假的不良学风；继续强化国内外的民间学术交流，以及科学普及工作。
    中国科协三届十三次常委会，今天还向各全国性学会、各级科协组织和广大科技工作者发出倡议，号召他们要站在社会主义物质文明和社会主义精神文明建设的前列，坚持四项基本原则，为社会主义现代化建设做出努力。
