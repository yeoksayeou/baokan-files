The province of Fujian, known as "Min" (八闽), is the southeastern bulwark of the Republic. Over the past decade of reform and opening up, Fujian's gross national product, national income, and total social output value have all more than doubled.

During the war years, Fujian was a famous "Soviet area," and after liberation, it became the frontline of anti-enemy struggles. Throughout the long period of revolutionary war and socialist revolution and construction, the military and the people have forged deep bonds of blood and flesh. Leaders such as Yang Shangkun, Li Xiannian, Wang Zhen, and Yang Baibing, who have inspected work in Fujian, have all praised the military-civilian relations in Fujian.

What makes these relations good? Through interviews, the authors found that the most profound impression is the people's support for the military.

    Always Carefully Support Military Construction

The leadership of the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government frequently emphasize this concept to their subordinates: "We cannot only think of the people's army when facing foreign invasions, natural disasters, social unrest, or threats to people's lives and property. We also cannot only visit the troops during New Year, Spring Festival, or August 1st. We must think of the military in all matters and care for the military at all times."

They say, "The military is a major national affair that cannot be overlooked. The people's army is the strong pillar of the Republic. The recent suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital once again revealed this simple yet profound truth. In times of peace and construction, maintaining the military is also a matter of a thousand days. Because the military is not only the defender of economic construction but also a supporter and participant in economic construction. Only by keeping the military strong in peacetime can it charge forward without hesitation in critical moments."

Provincial Committee Secretary Chen Guangyi and Governor Wang Zhao'guo told the authors in an unquestionable tone: "Loving or not loving the people's army, supporting or not supporting military construction, is not a trivial matter, but a major political principle."

In April and May of this year, a turmoil aimed at denying the Party's leadership and socialism spread across China. Even in such a critical period, the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government did not forget to take care of military affairs.

Here is a segment of their work schedule:

On May 17th, Provincial Committee Secretary Chen Guangyi published an article in the Fujian Daily, calling on all the people of the province to support military construction with practical actions.

On June 4th, after the suppression of the Beijing counter-revolutionary riot, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government immediately required all levels of Party and government in the province to publicize the military's significant contributions in stopping the turmoil, suppressing the riot, and in socialist construction and reform and opening up, inspiring the people of the province to love the troops.

On June 11th, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government held a special office meeting, proposing requirements for further improving support for the military.

On June 13th, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government held a conference to summarize and commend the development of sideline food production and operations by troops stationed in Fujian, further clarifying the new tasks of supporting military construction.

    Considering Both Local Difficulties and the Troops' Hardships

During our interviews, we met with some officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Fujian. Many comrades told us that the people of Fujian support the military, and the most precious thing is their sincerity, practical actions, and consistency.

In mid-June of this year, the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government held a commendation meeting. The recipients of the commendation were not local residents but 14 advanced units of the troops stationed in Fujian that had developed sideline food production and operations. The awards were also quite unique: not fashionable items like refrigerators, color TVs, or tape recorders, but feed grains—corn—for promoting the troops' pig-raising industry. These 320 tons of corn were purchased from the Northeast, thousands of miles away, with 10 million yuan from the province. The first prize was 30 tons, and the second prize was 20 tons. The provincial committee secretary and governor personally presented the awards.

The troops' development of production and operations has achievements, and the local government actually rewards them with tens of millions of yuan. As the provincial leaders said, the troops' development of production and operations is not only the troops' business but also the local government's business. Military and civilians are one family!

The leaders of the Fujian Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government always think of the military's hardships when discussing local difficulties. Therefore, the difficulties in military construction are the hotspots and focal points of their support for the military.

When the prices of sideline food in Fujian were liberalized, the Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government immediately thought of a problem: prices have risen, but military funding has not increased, and the living standards of officers and soldiers will decline. To solve this prominent problem, they decided to enrich the troops' "vegetable basket." In the past few years, the provincial government allocated more than 10 million yuan as living and sideline food production subsidies for the troops stationed in Fujian. In the past two years, despite the province's financial difficulties, the province allocated another 7.5 million yuan to support the troops' production development. Of this, 5.5 million yuan was provided as a grant, and 2 million yuan was an interest-free loan.

Last year, Fujian Province was hit by a strong typhoon, and vegetable production along the coast was seriously affected, resulting in a shortage and high prices of vegetables. When the province considered providing vegetable price subsidies to some coastal cities, it also thought of the soldiers' "difficulty in eating vegetables." Therefore, when providing 700,000 yuan in subsidies to the coastal cities of Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Putian, it also provided 500,000 yuan in subsidies to the troops. This spring festival, Fuzhou City allocated 170,000 jin of vegetables free of charge to support the troops when arranging vegetable supplies for residents.

Fujian is a mountainous province with limited grain production, and every year it has to import a considerable amount of rice from outside the province. To ensure that the troops eat good grain, the grain department has had the "three priorities" and "three preferences" regulations since liberation. The three priorities are: prioritize the military over local areas, prioritize the frontline over the rear, and prioritize high mountains and islands over the mainland; the three preferences are: prioritize supply, prioritize ordering, and prioritize delivery to the troops. Many places give their high-quality grain to the troops.

During our visit to the provincial government, we saw a report from Zhang Hua, the head of the Provincial Economic Commission: "Governor: As per your instructions, we have studied with the Provincial Military Region. The main difficulties for the island troops are water and electricity. Solving all problems requires 2.3 million yuan."

When mentioning Zhang Hua's name, almost all officers and soldiers of the troops stationed in Fujian are familiar with him. He is the deputy head of the Provincial Economic Commission and the head of the Provincial Support Commission. He understands the hardships of the coastal island troops and is a warm-hearted person who is willing to help the troops solve problems. No one can remember how many times he has gone deep into the small island troops, but they know he is an "old islander and old grassroots soldier without a military uniform." Even the governor mentioned in introducing related situations, "Zhang Hua knows the specific situation better than me. Please go and find Zhang Hua."

A few days after seeing Zhang Hua's report, we were pleased to learn: The Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government made a decision at a joint office meeting: stop some local construction projects and allocate 2.38 million yuan to solve the water and electricity problems of the main coastal island troops by the end of this year. This is another good news for the island military and civilians.

    Establish and Formulate Necessary Systems, Regulations, and Policies

At the beginning of this year, Governor Wang Zhao'guo led a delegation of 18 provincial and municipal bureau leaders to visit 15 companies and 3 sentry posts in coastal, mountainous, and island areas. During the visit, they saw that the officers and soldiers had difficulties with water and electricity. The leaders of the water conservancy, power, and planning commissions immediately decided to allocate 100 tons of cement and 40 tons of steel to the troops. The leaders of the civil affairs department found that the places where the officers and soldiers lived were quite damp and immediately issued 15,000 medium-sized cotton towels to them, and planned to issue one electric blanket or quilt to each island soldier this year.

To gradually bring support for military families and veterans onto the track of the rule of law, since 1986, Fujian Province has formulated local regulations such as the "Measures for the Care of Families of Martyrs, Soldiers, and Disabled Veterans in Rural Areas of Fujian Province," the "Trial Measures for the Care of Families of Soldiers in Urban Areas of Fujian Province," and the "Implementation Details of the Regulations on the Placement of Demobilized Soldiers in Fujian Province" based on relevant national laws.

The Party and government leaders of Fujian Province believe that the more the military endures, the more the people should love them. Love is not just about giving money and goods; it is more important to give policies to promote the development of the troops' production and operations. Last June, the provincial government formulated 17 preferential policies for the troops stationed in Fujian based on the opinions of various departments.

"The troops have difficulties, go to the Support Office," is a sentence often said in the troops stationed in Fujian.

The "Support Office" is a specialized institution with Fujian coastal support characteristics that directly serves the troops. It was born in 1956, and its main tasks in peacetime are to help the troops develop production and operations, ensure logistics services, and solve aftercare concerns.

The "Support Office" is actually the "Military Work Office" of the local government, a bridge and bond between the military and local areas, and an organizational guarantee for Fujian Province's enduring support for the military.

    The Flower of Support for the Military is Rooted in the Fertile Soil of Society

In recent years, the coverage of national defense education in Fujian Province has reached 70.1% in county-level organizations, 90.6% in towns and townships, 82.2% in enterprise units, and 68.9% in various schools.

Leaders at all levels of the Party and government in the province take the lead in strengthening national defense awareness. The leaders of the Xiamen Municipal Government often visit coastal islands, talk with the officers and soldiers of the garrison troops, and sometimes even move the municipal government's standing committee meeting to the Xiamen Garrison Command to have military leaders give military lessons.

The national defense education of the whole people and the exemplary role of the leaders have strongly enhanced the people's patriotic and supportive thoughts for the military, forming a strong atmosphere of caring for and supporting military construction.

Zhanzhou City, known as the "Hometown of Flowers and Fruits," is located in the southern Fujian Golden Triangle. The locals reclaim land to plant economic crops such as bananas, pineapples, and lychees, with high returns. In August last year, a certain unit of the garrison troops conducted military exercises, and the locals' eucalyptus, pineapple, and lychee trees suffered some losses. The troops calculated and compensated 100,000 yuan, but the locals did not want to increase the troops' burden and only accepted 10,000 yuan. They said, "Why are you exercising? Isn't it to defend the motherland and protect us common people?"

The famous civilized city of Sanming has a Bai Lie District Department Store where the service staff voluntarily and long-term insist on sending goods to the air force's certain radar station, which is 1,500 meters above sea level, to bring smiles and warmth to the soldiers.

In Xiamen City, there is a grain and oil military supply store that says, "Rather than bother ourselves a thousand times, we will not let the troops feel inconvenienced even a little." As soon as you enter, you see sacks of grain piled up like small mountains. On the wall of the office, there are red banners, one of which reads: "Awarded to the Xiamen City Grain and Oil Supply Company Military Supply Store: Advanced Unit in Military Grain Supply," signed by the Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China and the General Logistics Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The date is September 1986.

The 16 employees of this store are responsible for the grain supply of more than 100 catering units and industrial and commercial units of the troops stationed in Xiamen. In the past, they waited for customers in the store. Starting in 1985, they launched the "Convenience for the Troops" campaign, setting up "Grain Delivery Points" in military hospitals and garrison areas, delivering grain to the doorstep without any remuneration, and regularly delivering grain to the doorstep every month. In early 1986, when they learned that the troops would set up 4 retirement points for retired cadres, they actively contacted the municipal civil affairs bureau and voluntarily took on the task of delivering goods to these 4 points. Currently, this store voluntarily undertakes the task of 9 regular grain delivery points. Over the past five years, they have delivered more than 100,000 jin of grain to the doorstep.

The famous overseas Chinese hometown of Shishi City's Shatou Village has a "Women's Support Group" composed of 23 women who have voluntarily carried out support activities for the troops for 23 years, doing some services within their abilities for the officers and soldiers. Now, these women are old, some over seventy, weak and sick, but they still participate in support activities. The soldiers affectionately call them "Overseas Chinese Support Mothers." Last year, this support group was rated as an advanced unit for supporting the military by the General Political Department and the Ministry of Civil Affairs.

According to statistics from relevant provincial departments, in recent years, Fujian has established more than 20,000 support and veteran service organizations, with a total of 160,000 people, active in the cities and countryside of Min, helping the troops and military families solve difficulties.

    拥军之花常开不败
    ——福建省关心支持军队建设纪事
    蔡圣广  郑茂生  陈宝安
    素有“八闽”之称的福建省，是共和国的东南屏障。十年改革开放，使福建的国民生产总值、国民收入、社会总产值都翻了一番以上。
    战争年代，福建是著名的“苏区”，解放后又是对敌斗争的前哨，在长期的革命战争与社会主义革命和建设中，军队与人民结下了血肉深情。先后到福建视察工作的杨尚昆、李先念、王震、杨白冰等领导同志，都交口称赞福建的军政、军民关系好。
    好在哪里？笔者通过采访，感触最深的，是这里人民的拥军之情。
          必须时刻关心支持军队建设
    福建省委、省政府领导，经常向部下强化这样一个观念：
  “我们不能只是在抵御外敌入侵、抢险救灾、社会动乱或人民生命财产受到威胁之时才想到人民军队，也不能只是在元旦、春节、‘八一’到来时才走访部队，应当事事想到军队，时时关心军队。”
    他们说，兵者，国之大事，不可不察。人民军队是共和国的坚强柱石，这次平息首都反革命暴乱又一次揭示了这个简单而又深刻的真理。在和平建设时期，养兵千日用兵也是千日，因为军队不仅是经济建设的捍卫者，也是经济建设的支持者和参加者。平时使军队兵强马壮，关键时刻才能一往无前。
    省委书记陈光毅、省长王兆国用不容置疑的口吻告诉笔者：热爱不热爱人民的军队，支持不支持军队建设，不是个一般的问题，而是个重大的政治原则问题。
    今年4、5月间，一场旨在否定党的领导，否定社会主义的社会动乱，在中国大地上蔓延。就在这样非常时期，福建省委和省政府依然没有忘记把军队的事办好。
    请看他们的一段工作日程——
    5月17日，省委书记陈光毅在福建日报上发表文章，号召全省人民以实际行动关心支持军队建设。
    6月4日，平息北京反革命暴乱后，省委、省政府立即要求全省各级党和政府，宣传军队在制止动乱、平息暴乱以及在社会主义建设和改革开放中的重大贡献，激发全省人民对子弟兵的热爱。
    6月11日，省委、省政府专门召开办公会，提出进一步搞好拥军工作的要求。
    6月13日，省委、省政府召开驻闽部队发展副食品生产经营总结表彰大会，进一步明确支持部队建设的新任务。
    既想地方困难也想部队的苦衷
    我们在采访中接触了一些驻闽部队指战员，许多同志告诉笔者，福建人民拥军，最可贵的是动真情，办实事，坚持一贯。
    今年6月中旬，福建省委、省政府召开了一个表彰会，受表彰的不是地方群众，而是驻闽部队14个发展副食品生产经营的先进单位。拿到的奖品也挺新鲜：不是时髦的冰箱、彩电、录音机等消费品，而是为促进部队养猪事业发展的饲料粮——玉米。这些玉米，是省里拿出100万元不远数千里，从东北买来的，共320吨。一等奖30吨，二等奖20吨。省委书记、省长亲自发奖。
    部队搞生产经营有成绩，地方政府竟拿出百万巨款进行奖励，按省领导的话说，部队搞生产经营，既是部队的事，也是地方的事，军民一家嘛！
    福建省委、省政府领导每当议论地方的困难时，也想到军队的苦衷。所以，部队建设中的难点，就是他们拥军的热点和重点。
    在福建省副食品价格放开时，省委、省政府马上联想到一个问题：物价上涨了，而军费却没有增加，官兵的生活水平就要下降。为了解决这一突出问题，他们决定给部队的“菜篮子”充实内容。前几年，省政府拨款1000多万元作为驻闽部队的生活补贴和副食品生产补贴。近两年，在省财政收入比较困难的情况下，省里又拨出专款750万元支持部队发展生产。其中550万元无偿支援，200万元为无息贷款。
    去年福建省受到强台风袭击，沿海的蔬菜生产受到严重影响，蔬菜少，价格高。省里在考虑给一些沿海城市居民蔬菜价格补贴时，也想到了子弟兵同样有“吃菜难”的问题。于是，在给福州、泉州、莆田3个沿海城市补贴70万元时，也给部队补贴了50万元。今年春节，福州市在给居民安排蔬菜供应时，也拨了170万斤蔬菜无偿支援部队。
    福建是个多山的省份，粮食产量有限，每年都要从省外调进相当数量的大米。为了让部队吃到好粮，粮食部门从解放以来一直就有“三先”、“三优”的规定。三先是：先军队后地方，先前线后后方，先高山海岛后陆地；三优是：对部队优先供应，优先开单，优先发货。许多地方将自己生产的优质粮让给部队。
    我们在省政府采访时，看到了省经委负责人张华的一份报告：“省长：按你的交代，同省军区研究，现在海岛驻军的主要困难是吃水和用电问题，全部解决要230万元。”
    提到张华的名字，驻闽部队的官兵几乎没有不熟悉的。他
  是省经委副主任、省支前委员会主任。他了解沿海岛屿部队的苦衷，是个乐于为部队排忧解难的热心人。他究竟深入小岛部队多少回，人们记不清了，只晓得他是个“不穿军装的老海岛、老基层”。连省长在给我们介绍有关情况中也不时地说：“这个问题具体情况张华比我清楚，请你们去找张华。”
    看到张华的报告没几天，我们就欣然获悉：省委、省政府联合办公会作出一项决定：停建地方一些建设项目，挤出238万元，限期今年全部解决沿海主要岛屿驻军的用水、用电问题。这对海岛军民来说，又是一个福音。
    建立和制定必要的制度、法规和政策
    今年初，省长王兆国率领省、市18个厅局领导组成的慰问团，走访了沿海、山区、岛屿的15个连队、3个哨所。走访中，他们看到官兵用水、用电有困难，水利、电力、计委等部门领导，当即拍板，拨出100吨水泥、40吨钢材给部队。民政部门领导发现官兵住的地方比较潮湿，立即为他们发放1.5万条中型棉毛巾，并拟定今年再为海岛部队每人配发一床电热毯或毛毯。
    为了使拥军优属工作逐步走上法制轨道，1986年以来，福建省根据国家的有关法律，分别制定了《福建省农村优待烈士家属、义务兵家属、残疾军人办法》、《福建省城镇义务兵家属优待试行办法》、《福建省〈退伍义务兵安置条例〉实施细则》等地方性法规。
    福建省的党政领导认为，军队越是忍耐，人民越要疼爱。疼爱，光给钱给物是有限的，更重要的是给政策，促进部队发展生产经营。去年6月，省政府根据各部门提出的70多条意见，综合制定出《支持驻闽部队发展生产经营的有关规定》，给驻闽三军和武警部队17条优惠政策。
    “部队有困难，去找支前办”，这是驻闽部队中经常说的一句话。
    “支前办”是一个具有福建沿海拥军特色的、直接为部队服务的专门机构。它诞生于1956年，其具体任务平时主要是帮助部队发展生产经营，保障后勤服务，解决后顾之忧。
    “支前办”实际上是地方政府的“军队工作处”，是军地之间的桥梁和纽带，是福建省拥军工作经久不衰的一个组织保证。
  拥军之花根植于社会的沃土之中
    近年来，福建全省国防教育开课面，县级机关达70.1％，乡镇达90.6％，企业单位达82.2％，各类学校达68.9％。
    全省各级党政领导带头增强国防观念。厦门市政府领导经常到沿海岛屿走一走，看一看，同守岛部队官兵谈一谈。邹尔均市长有时干脆把市政府常务会搬到厦门警备区机关去开，请军事首脑们讲军事课。
    全民性的国防教育和领导的表率作用，有力地强化了人民群众的爱国拥军思想，形成了关心支持军队建设的强烈氛围。
    素有“花果之乡”殊荣的漳州市，地处闽南金三角，群众拓荒垦地种植香蕉、菠萝、荔枝等经济作物，收益很高。去年8月，驻军某部进行军事演习，群众的桉树、菠萝、荔枝树等受到一些损失，部队经核算赔偿1万元，但是群众不愿增加部队负担，只收1000元。他们说，你们演习为了什么？还不是为了保卫祖国，保卫我们老百姓嘛！
    著名的文明城市三明市有个梅列区百货商场，服务人员自愿长期坚持把商品送上海拔1500多米的空军某雷达站，给战士们送去微笑，送去温暖。
    在厦门市有个“宁肯自己麻烦千遍，不让部队稍感不便”的粮油军供门市部。一进门就看到一麻袋一麻袋的粮食堆得像小山似的。办公室的墙上挂着一面面鲜红的锦旗，其中有一面锦旗上写着“授予厦门市粮油供应公司军供门市部：军粮供应工作先进单位”，落款是中华人民共和国商业部，中国人民解放军总后勤部印。时间是：1986年9月。
    这个门市部16名职工，担负着驻厦部队100多个伙食单位和工商行业用粮供应。过去他们守店待买。1985年开始他们开展“为部队送方便”活动，在部队医院、驻地设立“送粮上门供应点”，不计任何报酬，每月定期送粮上门。1986年初，当他们了解到部队将增设4个离休干部安置点后，就积极与市民政局联系，主动要求承担这4个安置点送货上门的任务。目前，这个门市部义务承担9个定期送粮上门供应点的任务。5年来，共送粮上门100多万公斤。
    著名侨乡石狮市沙堤村，有一个由23名妇女自发组成的
  “三八妇女拥军组”，23年如一日开展拥军活动，为指战员们做一些力所能及的服务工作。如今，这些妇女都老了，有的年过七旬，体弱多病，照样参加拥军活动。战士们亲切地称她们是
  “侨乡拥军妈”。去年，这个拥军小组被总政治部、民政部评为拥军先进单位。
    据省有关部门统计，近几年来，福建各地相继建立了2万多个拥军优属层服务组织，共16万多人，活跃在八闽城乡，为部队和军烈属排忧解难。
