Mozambican President Chissano today called for negotiations between the opposing Mozambican National Resistance and the government to achieve national peace.

He made this appeal this afternoon during a meeting with visiting Kenyan President Moi. He also called for international assistance to help Mozambique resolve its problems.

President Moi had previously expressed his willingness to mediate, stating that his visit was aimed at helping the Mozambican people achieve peace.

Moi revealed that the Kenyan government has been in contact with those opposing the Mozambican government to persuade them to see the light.

He said that dialogue is better than war, and the resistance movement also hopes for peace and is willing to participate in negotiations with the government. He expressed great optimism about this.

Mozambican President Chissano today announced that Kenyan President Moi has accepted his invitation to act as a mediator between the Mozambican government and the Mozambican opposition group, the National Resistance.

Moi concluded his two-day visit to Mozambique today and returned to Nairobi.

Chissano said he and Moi plan to first form a group of African heads of state, including Zimbabwean President Mugabe, to advance the peace process in Mozambique. He indicated that the group will later include other African heads of state, especially those from frontline states.

Moi stated that the Kenyan government has long advised the Mozambican National Resistance to make rational decisions, and that the movement also hopes for peace in Mozambique rather than endless civil war. The civil war in Mozambique has lasted for 14 years. Moi expressed optimism about the prospects for peace in Mozambique.

    新华社马普托7月22日电 莫桑比克总统希萨诺今天宣布，肯尼亚总统莫伊已接受他的邀请，在莫桑比克政府和莫反政府组织——全国抵抗运动之间充当调解人。
    莫伊结束对莫桑比克的两天访问之后今天回到内罗毕。
    希萨诺说，他和莫伊准备首先和津巴布韦总统穆加贝一起组成一个非洲国家首脑小组，把莫桑比克的和平进程向前推进。他表示，将来该小组还要吸收其他非洲国家元首、特别是前线国家的元首参加。
    莫伊表示，肯尼亚政府早已规劝过莫桑比克全国抵抗运动要采取理智的决策，而该运动也希望莫桑比克恢复和平而不是一味地陷入无休止的内战。莫桑比克的内战已延续了14年之久。莫伊对莫桑比克的和平前景表示乐观。
