The "Silk Road Art Exhibition" opened on July 13 at the National Art Museum of China. In the summer and autumn of 1989, more than 60 artists from over a dozen provinces, including Taiwan and Hong Kong, set out from Urumqi, traveling along the Silk Road. Over the course of two months and a journey of more than 20,000 miles, they conducted research and created artworks. The artists drew inspiration from the magnificent scenery of the Silk Road, particularly the rich and diverse local customs and traditions, to produce a vibrant collection of works. More than 200 outstanding pieces were selected from submissions across the nation.

Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress, Xi Zhongxun, and Saifuddin Azizi attended the opening ceremony.
