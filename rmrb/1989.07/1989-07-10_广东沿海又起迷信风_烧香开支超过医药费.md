Recently, the statistics bureau of Jieyang County conducted a sample survey in 8 villages across 4 towns, covering 80 households. The results showed that in the first half of this year, the average expenditure per person on burning incense, candles, paper money, and other superstitious items during rituals amounted to 7.31 yuan, a 45% increase compared to the same period last year, equivalent to the expenditure for the entire year of 1987. This expenditure is 2.5% higher than the cost of medical treatment. In the first half of this year, Jieyang County spent a total of 8.735 million yuan on burning incense, candles, and paper money during rituals to worship gods and ghosts.

The types of superstitious items in the coastal areas of Guangdong are diverse and varied. In addition to the traditional incense, candles, paper money, and funeral clothes, new items have emerged, such as high-quality paper printed with beautiful designs named "Heavenly Bank" notes, as well as houses, cars, and household appliances made from bamboo strips, wooden sticks, and paper. Some units and individuals have turned the production of superstitious items into a lucrative business. In some places, markets specializing in the sale of superstitious items have even appeared.

    广东沿海又起迷信风  烧香开支超过医药费
    新华社广州7月10日电　（记者李沪）广东沿海农村封建迷信活动日益严重，不少地方拜神祭鬼时焚烧香烛、纸钱的开支，超过了治病吃药的费用。
    揭阳县统计局最近在4个镇的8个村抽样调查80户农民，结果表明：今年上半年平均每人用于拜祭鬼神时焚烧掉的香烛、纸钱等迷信品的费用竟达7.31元，比去年同期增加45％，相当前年一年的开支。这笔开支比治病吃药的费用多2.5％。揭阳县今年上半年用于拜神祭鬼而焚烧掉的香烛、纸钱的费用高达人民币873.5万元。
    广东沿海各地的迷信品种类繁多，式样五花八门。除以往的香烛、纸钱、冥衣外，新近还发现选用高档纸张，印制精美取名为“天国银行”的冥币，以及用竹片木条和纸张糊搭编制的房屋、汽车、家用电器等。一些单位和个人把生产迷信品作为发财致富的门路，在一些地方甚至出现了专门销售迷信品的市场。
