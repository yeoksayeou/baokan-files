Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, June 28th.

    The ecological zone in Mexico's southeastern state of Quintana Roo has been declared in a state of emergency. A forest fire that has been burning for over 40 days has already consumed 100,000 hectares of primeval forest and is continuing to spread at a rate of 2,700 hectares per day. Efforts to extinguish the fire have so far been ineffective.

    Due to the extensive burning of the tropical rainforest, the local microclimate has changed, and even the "Caribbean paradise" of Cancun has felt the heat. The ancient ruins of Tulum, dating back to the 5th century, are also under threat from the encroaching flames. Within the "Sian Ka'an" biosphere reserve, where the Maya civilization was born, over 1,200 precious species of flora and fauna are facing unprecedented destruction. Local agricultural authorities estimate that the value of the burned pine and mahogany alone exceeds 10 billion pesos, with the total forestry loss estimated at 80 billion pesos (approximately $320 million). The burned tropical rainforest will take at least 20 years to recover.

    墨西哥金塔纳罗生态区罹难
    本报墨西哥城6月28日电　记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥东南部金塔纳罗州生态区宣告处于紧急状态：持续40余日的森林火灾已经吞噬10万公顷原始林木，还在以每天烧毁2700公顷的速度蔓延。迄今为止进行的扑火努力基本无效。
    由于大面积热带雨林过火造成当地小气候的变化，连“加勒比天堂”坎昆也感到了烈焰的炙烤。座落在生态区内公元5世纪的图伦古迹也处在烈火可能造成的威胁下。在诞生了玛雅文明的“希安康”世界级生物圈内，1200余种珍贵的动植物资源正遭受着前所未有的劫难。当地农村部门估计，仅仅烧毁的雪松木与桃花心木就价值100亿比索以上，整个林业损失估计已达8000亿比索（约合3.2亿美元）。已经过火的热带雨林将需要20年时间才能恢复。
