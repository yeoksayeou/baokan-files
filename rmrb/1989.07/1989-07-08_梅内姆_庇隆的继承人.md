On July 8th, Argentina's elected president, Carlos Saul Menem, took the oath of office, taking over the blue and white sash and staff symbolizing the highest authority five months ahead of schedule, beginning his arduous journey of governing this South American country.

Menem was born on July 2nd, 1930 in the town of Anillaco to a Syrian merchant family that had immigrated to Argentina. He attended primary and secondary school there. Later, he and his brother Munir went to the renowned University of Córdoba to study. Menem was intelligent and diligent, completing the four-year law program in three years and earning a law degree. His father, Saoud, was proud of his son's achievements and bought a brand-new office as a gift, which Menem used to establish his law firm.

While in university, Menem began participating in political activities and joined the University Student Union. In 1953, during the Eva Cup basketball tournament, the University of Córdoba team won the championship, and General Perón, the President of the Republic, personally presented the trophy. The young Menem, as a team member, was honored to meet the general. After the Perón government was overthrown, many members of the Justice Party were persecuted by the military government. Menem, as a lawyer, provided legal defense for the victims. Soon after, he became the chairman of the Peronist Youth Movement and in the 1960s, he led the Justice Party's work in the province of La Rioja.

In October 1964, Menem visited his ancestral home in Syria and stopped in Madrid on his way, where he met General Perón, who was in exile. The 69-year-old leader of the Justice Party told him, "In politics, one must learn to soar like an eagle, not crawl like a snake on the ground." Menem took this advice to heart and, through years of political practice, developed his own style, steadily rising in political status. Over the past decade, he has been elected governor of La Rioja province three times. After the military coup in 1976, a patrol of soldiers took him from the governor's mansion, and it was not until five years later that he regained his freedom.

After Perón's death, the Justice Party was long divided, and its strength and influence waned. In recent years, Menem has raised the banner of reform within the party, summarized lessons, unified the party's thinking, and maintained party unity. Last year, when the Justice Party formed a new national leadership committee, Menem was elected as the first vice-chairman. Later, he was nominated as the presidential candidate.

During the several months of intense campaigning, Menem, dressed modestly and approachable, tirelessly traveled the country three times, passionately promoting the Justice Party's election platform, which he believed would meet the demands of the broad masses. He advocated for a "production revolution" as a cure for the severe economic crisis, cracking down on financial speculation, and significantly increasing wages to stimulate domestic production, increase employment, improve the lives of the people, and stabilize the economic situation. He believed that the government, business sector, and unions should reach a "social contract" to save the country, each doing their part. Menem's platform won the support of the broad masses of middle and lower-class voters who had long suffered from the economic crisis. Additionally, the Justice Party had 4 million members and the support of powerful unions, which paved the way for him to the Pink House (the presidential palace).

Menem is energetic and affable. He has a distinctive goatee, loves horse riding, racing, and playing soccer, and works tirelessly, all of which leave a good impression. The day before the election, to relax, the 59-year-old Menem wore a yellow sports outfit, tied a white headband, and ran on the green field for over an hour. Afterwards, he played two games of tennis with his nephew. On the morning of May 14th, after voting, Menem personally flew a single-engine plane from the provincial capital of La Rioja to his hometown of Anillaco, spending an unforgettable time with his family and fellow townspeople. His wife, Sulema Fatima Yoma, is also Syrian, and their son and daughter have both grown up.

Argentina's history has turned a new page. President Menem, tasked with the country's difficulties, faces a stern challenge. People hope that this "successor of Perón" will achieve new feats on the journey to revive the republic.

    梅内姆——
    庇隆的继承人
    7月8日，阿根廷当选总统卡洛斯·萨乌尔·梅内姆宣誓就职，提前5个月接过象征最高权力的蓝白绶带和权杖，开始了治理这个南美国家的艰难历程。
    梅内姆1930年7月2日出生于阿尼利亚科镇一个移居阿根廷的叙利亚商人家庭。梅内姆在这里上小学和中学。后来，他和弟弟穆尼尔一起到有名的科尔多瓦大学读书。梅内姆聪明勤奋，用3年时间修完了法律系4年的课程，获得律师学位。父亲萨乌德为儿子的成绩感到自豪，买下一间全新的办公室作为礼物，赠给梅内姆开设律师事务所。
    在大学里，梅内姆就开始参与政治活动，加入了大学生总联合会。1953年在埃娃杯篮球锦标赛中，科尔多瓦大学队获得冠军，共和国总统庇隆将军亲自颁发奖杯。年轻的梅内姆身为队员，为能认识将军感到荣幸。庇隆政府被推翻后，许多正义党人受到军政府迫害，梅内姆律师为受害者进行法律辩护。不久，他出任庇隆主义青年运动主席，60年代主持正义党在拉里奥哈省的工作。
    1964年10月，梅内姆去叙利亚老家探亲途经马德里时，拜访了流亡中的庇隆将军。这位年已69岁的正义党领袖对他说，“在政治上必须学会像鹰那样飞翔，而不要学蛇在地上爬行。”梅内姆牢记这一忠告，在长期的从政实践中形成了自己的风格，政治地位稳步上升。10多年来，他3次被选为拉里奥哈省的省长。1976年发生军事政变后，一支军人巡逻队把他从省长官邸抓走，5年之后才恢复自由。
    庇隆去世之后，正义党长期不团结，党的力量和影响下降。近几年来，梅内姆在正义党内打起革新的旗帜，总结教训，统一全党认识，维护党的团结。去年，正义党组成新的全国领导委员会时，梅内姆被选为第一副主席。后来，他获得了总统候选人的提名。
    在几个月喧腾的竞选运动中，衣着朴素、平易近人的梅内姆不辞辛劳，3次周游各地，热情宣讲正义党顺应广大群众要求所提出的竞选纲领。他主张以“生产革命”作为克服严重经济危机的药方，打击金融投机，以大幅度提高工资来刺激国内生产，增加就业，改善群众生活，稳定经济形势。他认为应由政府、企业界和工会达成“社会契约”，为拯救国家各尽其力。梅内姆的纲领得到了多年来深受经济危机打击之苦的广大中下层选民的拥护。加上正义党拥有400万党员，又有势力强大的工会的支持，他终于打通了走向玫瑰宫（总统府所在地）的道路。
    梅内姆精力充沛，举止随和。他长着特殊的连鬓胡，喜爱骑马、赛车、踢球，不知疲倦地工作，这些给人留下良好的印象。大选前一天，为了松弛一下，59岁的梅内姆身着黄色运动衣，头扎白带，在绿茵场上奔跑了一个多小时。随后，又和他的侄子打了两场网球。5月14日选举日上午，梅内姆投票之后，亲自驾驶单引擎飞机，从省会拉里奥哈飞往故乡阿尼利亚科，与家人和乡亲们度过令人难忘的时刻。他的妻子苏莱玛·法蒂玛·约马也是叙利亚人，他们的一子一女都已长大。
    阿根廷历史掀开了新的一页。梅内姆总统受命于危难之机，面临着严峻的挑战。人们希望这位“庇隆的继承人”在重振共和国的征途中有新的建树。　·管彦忠·
