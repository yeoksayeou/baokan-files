The six regions in Southwest China, adhering to the principle of equality and mutual benefit, have been striving to develop a comprehensive, multi-level, and multi-form economic cooperation network. Over the past five years, they have gradually formed a new pattern of horizontal economic cooperation aimed at common development and prosperity. This was learned by the reporter at the recent economic coordination meeting of the five provinces and one region.

The Southwest region is vast, populous, and rich in resources, making it one of the regions with the greatest economic development potential in China. In 1984, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Chongqing took the lead in breaking regional barriers and established the four provinces and one region five-party economic coordination meeting. In 1986, Tibet joined. A new pattern of horizontal economic cooperation focusing on agriculture, energy, and transportation, with commodity circulation as the breakthrough, capital flow as the bond, central cities as the support, and enterprise cooperation as the foundation, has taken shape in the Southwest. The horizontal links among the five provinces and one region have broken through the economic realm and have been widely carried out in culture, education, health, and politics.

So far, the number of industry cooperation organizations in the Southwest region has increased to 76, and there are more than 30 enterprise groups and enterprise clusters. The scope of cooperation almost covers all industries, including production, product development, export earnings, scientific research, and information, all of which have gradually formed a Southwest network, realizing a one-stop service for capital, talent, production, and sales in the Southwest region. Administrative divisions and enterprises have developed from "singing across the mountains" to "performing together." Over the past five years, the Southwest region has reached more than 150 cooperation projects in the joint development of mineral and biological resources, with a total investment of 190 million yuan. According to incomplete statistics, there are more than 20 investment projects with an investment of over 100,000 yuan each. The five provinces and one region have established 74 capital circulation markets of different sizes, and have also carried out extensive horizontal contacts with regions outside the Southwest, raising more than 10 billion yuan for the Southwest region, easing the capital shortage in the Southwest region.

    多方联合　扬长避短　互利互惠
    西南五省区六方共求发展
    本报拉萨6月28日电　记者刘伟报道：西南五省区六方本着平等互利原则，努力发展全方位、多层次、多形式的经济协作网络，5年来，已逐步形成以共同发展、共同繁荣为目标的横向经济联合新格局。这是记者在近日召开的五省区六方经济协调会上获悉的。
    西南地区地广人多资源丰富，是我国经济发展潜力最大的地区之一。1984年，川、滇、桂、黔、渝率先打破地区界限，成立了四省区五方经济协调会，1986年，西藏加盟。一个以农业、能源、交通为重点，商品流通为突破口，资金融通为纽带，中心城市为依托，企业间联合为基础，多层次、多形式、多渠道、全方位的横向经济联合协作新格局已在西南形成。五省六方的横向联系，已冲破经济范畴，在文化、教育、卫生、政治等方面广泛开展起来。
    到目前为止，西南地区行业协作组织已发展到76个，企业集团和企业群体发展到30多个。协作领域几乎遍布各个行业，生产、产品开发、出口创汇、科研、信息，都逐步形成西南网络，使西南地区联合协作实现了资金、人才、生产、销售一条龙，行政区划之间、企业与企业之间，从“隔山对歌”发展到“联合唱戏”。5年来，西南地区在联合开发矿产、生物方面达成了150多项协作项目，资金达1.9亿元。据不完全统计，投资项目在10万元以上的就有20多个。五省区六方已有不同规模的资金融通市场74个，还广泛开展了与西南区外的横向联系，为西南地区协进资金百亿多元，缓和了西南地区的资金短缺状况。
