In poverty alleviation work, we must combine it with the party and government's anti-corruption efforts, and seriously investigate and handle all cases of embezzlement, misappropriation, withholding, and private division of poverty alleviation funds, as well as the illegal sale of poverty alleviation materials." This was emphasized by Chen Junsheng, State Councilor and Director of the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas, at the eighth meeting of the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poor Areas held today.

The meeting mainly discussed two issues: how to fully utilize the benefits of poverty alleviation funds and materials, and how to combine poverty alleviation work with family planning.

Chen Junsheng said that in recent years of poverty alleviation work, the broad cadre in poor areas have adhered to and carried forward the party's fine tradition of sharing weal and woe with the people and striving hard together. Some places have clearly put forward the slogan of "the people will not be lifted out of poverty, and the county government building will not be built," which is very commendable and worthy of promotion. However, there are indeed a few places that ignore the people's hunger and cold, withhold, misappropriate, and occupy poverty alleviation funds, and even use poverty alleviation funds to build office buildings. Even worse, some departments, units, and cadres blatantly violate party discipline and state laws, privately divide and embezzle poverty alleviation funds, and illegally sell poverty alleviation materials. Although the proportion of such phenomena is not large, they have a very bad influence and seriously damage the reputation of the party and the government. Therefore, it is necessary to take further effective measures to stop such phenomena.

First, all illegal and disciplinary violations must be seriously investigated and handled. No matter who it is, no matter what background they have, all illegal and disciplinary cases must be investigated. Especially those who use their power to seek personal gain, the so-called "official speculators," must be severely punished. Not only should disciplinary actions be taken according to the nature and severity of the problem, but also legal responsibilities should be pursued. All illegal gains must be confiscated. It is necessary to firmly resist all kinds of so-called instructions, notes, or calls that do not conform to the regulations, and resist various kinds of intercession winds.

Second, the management responsibility system for poverty alleviation funds and materials must be further improved. The application, issuance, use, and recovery of poverty alleviation funds and materials must have stricter procedures and effective rules. Once illegal and disciplinary violations are found, not only should the responsibility of the project implementation unit be pursued, but also the responsibility of the approval unit. For units that have such problems but do not handle them seriously, the responsibility of negligence and dereliction of duty should be investigated. At the same time, economic penalties should be taken, such as deducting or not investing new poverty alleviation funds and materials.

Third, the transparency of the allocation and management of poverty alleviation funds and materials must be improved. Regardless of which department or unit manages the funds and materials, they must implement "three publicizations and one supervision." That is, the standards, methods, and amounts of fund and material allocation must be publicized; the projects and their types and contents for development must be publicized; and the poor households covered by each project and the expected results must also be publicized. Only by fully publicizing can we achieve fairness and cleanliness and prevent fraud. Therefore, we must publicize to society and let all sectors of society, especially news organizations, supervise our work.

Fourth, a system for inspecting and supervising poverty alleviation funds and materials must be established as soon as possible and gradually brought under legal regulation. Each poor county and provinces, autonomous regions, prefectures, and cities with large areas of poverty should use existing reporting centers, publicize reporting systems, encourage and welcome the masses to expose and report problems in this area. Each department should cooperate with each other to form a multi-level and multi-faceted effective supervision and inspection system on this basis. At the same time, the poverty alleviation and development departments and audit and supervision departments of each province and autonomous region should jointly formulate specific management methods to bring inspection and supervision under legal regulation.

Chen Junsheng also emphasized that poverty alleviation work must be combined with family planning work. On the one hand, we must accelerate the pace of economic development, and on the other hand, we must emphasize planned population growth, reduce the rapid increase in consumption caused by excessive population growth, and quickly change the situation of "the poorer, the more children, the more children, the poorer," "the more children, the more aid, the more aid, the more children." We must strive to achieve coordination between population growth and economic development.

    贪污挪用扶贫钱物现象严重
    陈俊生强调加强廉政建设改善扶贫工作
    本报北京6月30日讯　本报记者吴长生、新华社记者蒲立业报道：“在扶贫工作中要结合我们党和政府的廉政建设，严肃查处一切贪污、挪用、截留、私分扶贫资金和倒卖扶贫物资的事件。”这是国务委员、国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组组长陈俊生在今天召开的国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组第八次会议上提出的。
    这次会议主要研究如何充分发挥扶贫资金、物资的效益和如何将扶贫工作与计划生育工作结合起来两个问题。
    陈俊生说，在近几年的扶贫工作中，贫困地区的广大干部坚持和发扬了我们党与人民同甘苦、艰苦奋斗的优良作风，有的地方明确提出“群众不脱贫，不盖县衙门”的口号，这种精神和做法很值得提倡和推广。但也确有少数地区置群众饥寒而不顾，截留、挪用、挤占扶贫资金，甚至用扶贫资金营造楼堂馆所。更有甚者，个别部门、单位和干部无视党纪国法，私分、贪污扶贫资金，倒卖扶贫物资。这些现象所占比重虽不大，但却影响恶劣，严重地败坏了党和政府的声誉。因此必须进一步采取有力措施制止此类现象发生。
    一、要坚决严肃查处一切违法乱纪的事件。对一切违法乱纪的案件，不管是什么人，什么背景，都要查处。尤其是那些利用权力谋取私利的“官倒”，更要从严惩治。不仅要根据问题性质的情节轻重给予纪律处分直至追究法律责任，而且要没收其全部非法所得。要坚决顶住各种不符合规定的所谓批示、条子或者招呼，顶住各种各样的说情风。
    二、要进一步完善扶贫资金、物资管理责任制。扶贫资金、物资的申请、发放、使用和回收要有更严格的程序和有效的规则。一旦发现违法乱纪事件，不仅要追究项目执行单位的责任，而且要追究审批单位的责任，对于存在此类问题而又查处不力的单位，要追查失察和渎职责任。同时，要采取经济上的惩罚措施，扣减或不再投入新的扶贫资金和物资。
    三、要提高扶贫资金、物资分配管理的透明度。不管是哪个部门、哪个单位管理的资金、物资，都要实行“三公开、一监督”。即分配资金、物资的标准、方法和数额要公开；资金、物资用于开发的项目及其类型和内容要公开；每个项目覆盖的贫困户、应取得的效果也要公开。只有彻底公开才能公正廉洁，才能防止舞弊。因此，要向社会公开，让社会各界尤其是新闻单位来监督我们的工作。
    四、要尽快形成对扶贫资金、物资的检查监督制度，并逐步纳入法制轨道。各贫困县和贫困面较大的省、区、地、市，要利用现有的举报中心，公布举报制度，鼓励和欢迎群众揭发和检举这方面的问题。各部门要互相配合，在此基础上，形成多层次、多方面的有效的监督检查体系。同时，各省、区扶贫开发部门和审计、监察部门要联合制定具体的管理办法，把检查监督纳入法制轨道。
    陈俊生还强调，扶贫工作一定要和计划生育工作结合起来，一方面要加快经济开发的进程，另一方面要强调人口的有计划增长，减少由于人口过度增长带来的急剧增长的消费，尽快改变“越穷越生、越生越穷”、“越生越扶、越扶越生”的状况，努力做到使人口增长和经济发展相互协调。
