Gypsies are a people known for their singing and dancing, rich in romantic charm, and also a people who wander the world, making a living through fortune-telling and trickery. In recent years, Gypsies in the United States have been seen as a people who steal money and cause harm.

According to investigations by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service, there are now over 750,000 Gypsies in the United States, the vast majority of whom are illegal immigrants or overstaying visa holders. In recent years, some Gypsies have formed criminal gangs ranging from 6 to 30 people. Their networks span the entire country, using airplanes, cars, and other means of transportation to rob homes and stores, primarily targeting jewelry, silverware, antique rugs, and valuable furs, often committing crimes worth millions of dollars.

Gypsy theft gangs are elusive, often leaving the police empty-handed. A lawyer in Los Angeles said, "This is a well-organized, highly skilled, and financially powerful criminal gang." According to the FBI, in the first three months of last year, Gypsy gangs stole from 150 homes. The American Antique Rug Retailers Association reported that since 1980, approximately $20 million worth of antique rugs have been stolen by Gypsy gangs. A spokesperson for a legal organization believes that Gypsy gangs are involved in many theft cases.

Theft gangs are most active in southern California. From the end of 1987 to the beginning of 1988, they stole $10 million worth of jewelry and silverware in that state. Two of the most notorious gangs operate in New York and Chicago, one specializing in home robberies and the other in retail store thefts.

The gangs often collaborate, sharing common hideouts. When a gang member is caught, these "clients" provide bail and lawyers for them.

The theft gangs also include women. New York State police officer Delbert George said: Gypsy women are talented actresses. During interrogations, they either cry and scream, pretend not to understand English, or beg pitifully or close their eyes and remain silent.

Gypsy theft gangs use multiple fake names to deceive the police, hiding their past records. A woman named Maria used 46 different names during her criminal career.

The theft gangs have substantial funds. When their members are caught, they can provide large sums of bail. In Maine, three Gypsies were jailed for suspected theft, and four hours later, $112,000 in bail was delivered, allowing the three suspects to be released immediately.

Gypsy theft gangs have become a major headache for the police, who have taken a series of countermeasures. For example, the police have formed a Gypsy crime expert team; Baltimore City organized over 30 study classes on this topic; courts have increased the bail for Gypsy suspects, with California demanding $500,000 per person for those suspected of theft.

A leader of a Gypsy gang defended himself, saying: Their crimes are due to economic hardship and racial discrimination. Most Gypsies in the United States live below the poverty line, have no jobs, and receive no education. He said, "Gypsies need to feed their families, and theft is a last resort." The plight of the Gypsies reflects some of the social problems in the United States.

    美国的吉普赛犯罪团伙
    吉普赛是一个能歌善舞，富于浪漫色彩的民族，同时也是一个浪迹天涯，靠算命、骗术糊口的命运悲惨的民族。近年来，吉普赛在美国又被看成一个盗窃钱财为害一方的民族。
    据美国移民局的调查，现在美国的吉普赛人已超过75万，其中绝大多数是非法入境者，或超过护照居住期的非法逗留者。近年来，一部分吉普赛人组成了人数6至30人不等的犯罪团伙。他们的网络遍布全美，动用飞机、汽车等交通工具，抢劫民宅和商店，主要掠取珠宝、银器、古地毯和珍贵毛皮，常常做下百万美元以上的大案。
    吉普赛盗窃团伙神出鬼没，经常让警方望风捕影，无功而返。洛杉矶一位律师说：“这是一个组织严密、手段高超、资金雄厚的犯罪团伙。”根据联邦调查局的统计，去年头3个月，吉普赛团伙偷窃了150家。据美国古地毯零售商协会反映，自1980年以来，价值约2000万美元的古地毯从吉普赛盗窃团伙手中流入市场。一个律师组织发言人认为吉普赛团伙在许多盗窃案中涉嫌。
    盗窃团伙在加利福尼亚州南部活动最为猖獗，1987年底至1988年初，他们就在该州盗窃了价值1000万美元的珠宝和银器。两个声名最为显赫的团伙分别活动在纽约和芝加哥，一个的“兴趣”是盗窃民宅，另一个“主营”零售商店。
    各团伙之间经常往来，他们有着共同的窝赃点。当团伙有人落网后，这些“关系户”还负责为他们提供保释金和律师。
    盗窃团伙中还不乏女性。纽约州警官戴尔伯特·乔治说：吉普赛女人是天才的演员。在审讯中，她们或是哭闹，或是装作不懂英语，要不就苦苦哀求或闭目垂首，一言不发。
    吉普赛盗窃团伙靠反复更换假名蒙骗警方，以掩饰以往被捕的劣迹。一个名叫玛丽亚的妇女在做贼生涯中，共换了46个名字。
    盗窃团伙有雄厚的资金，当他们的成员落网后可为他们提供巨额保释金。缅因州有3个吉普赛人因涉嫌一起盗窃案而入狱，4小时后有人送来11.2万美元的保释金，3名嫌疑犯当即获释。
    吉普赛盗窃团伙已成为警方的心腹大患，他们采取了一系列应对措施。例如，警方已组成了吉普赛犯罪专家组；巴尔的摩市就此专题组织了30多个研究班；法庭提高了吉普赛嫌疑犯的保释金，加利福尼亚州对涉嫌一起盗窃案的吉普赛人，每人索取的保释金高达50万美元。
    一位吉普赛团伙领导人申辩说：他们的犯罪是因经济窘迫和种族歧视所致。在美国的吉普赛人多数生活在贫困线以下，没有工作，得不到教育。他说：“吉普赛人需要养家糊口，偷窃是不得已而为之。”吉普赛人的境遇从一个侧面反映了美国的社会问题。
