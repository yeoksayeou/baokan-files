The voluntary economic cooperation among 18 cities in Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces in the Nanjing region has achieved remarkable results over the past three years, becoming an important link in the "Yangtze River Economic Chain."

Since 18 cities began regional economic cooperation in 1986, three years of practice have broadened the scope of economic and technological cooperation among enterprises. According to preliminary statistics for the third year, enterprises within the region signed 520 economic and technological cooperation projects, of which 390 were implemented. Through horizontal cooperation, new production value increased by 8.32 billion yuan, a 90% increase over the previous year. New tax revenues and profits amounted to 1.5 billion yuan, a 145% increase over the previous year. The implementation of several major cooperative projects and the dissemination, matching, and key technology breakthroughs of famous, new, and special export-oriented products have significantly promoted the economic development of the cities and the entire region.

The development of new enterprise groups has further optimized the regional industrial structure, product structure, and the layout of productive forces. In the past year, the number of various enterprise groups within the region has increased from 56 to 85. Enterprise groups and clusters have evolved from single-product processing cooperation to a multi-faceted integrated structure involving material bases, processing enterprises, sales channels, and scientific research, education, and financial sectors. This has optimized the combination of various production factors within the region and coordinated the production and circulation links. The number of enterprises participating in the "Panda" electronics group has increased from 116 to 164, with the group's production value reaching 800 million yuan.

The four major markets of commodities, materials, finance, and technology are active, providing good services for regional economic development. In the past year, the commodity circulation and sales volume within the region reached over 40 billion yuan, playing an important role in easing regional market supply, balancing prices, and stabilizing market order.

Leveraging the preferential policies and ports of Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Yangzhou, the regional economy has developed local export-oriented economies in areas such as utilizing foreign capital, labor exports, "three comes one compensates," foreign exchange, adjustment, agency, and transit trade. This has expanded export earnings. The famous Zhenjiang vinegar, known worldwide, has established the "China Zhenjiang Hengshun Group" to expand exports. Nine enterprises from Yangzhou and Huainan have joined the group, cooperating to increase the export volume of Zhenjiang vinegar.

    苏皖赣十八地市横向经济联合
    南京区域合作效益显著
    本报南京7月12日电　记者孙健报道：苏皖赣3省18个地市自愿组成的南京区域经济合作3年来取得显著成果，成为“长江流域经济链”重要一环。
    自1986年18地市开始区域经济合作以来，经过3年的实践，企业之间经济技术合作领域更加广泛。据第3年度的初步统计，区域内企业之间共签订经济技术协作项目520项，其中实施390项；通过横向联合新增产值8.32亿元，比上年增长90％；新增税利1.5亿元，比上年增长145％。一批较大联合项目的实施和区域内的名、新、特以及出口创汇产品的扩散、配套，关键技术上的联合攻关，对于项目所在地市乃至整个区域经济的发展起了很大推动作用。
    企业集团的新发展，使区域产业、产品结构和生产力的布局进一步优化。近一年来，区域内各类企业集团由过去的56个发展到85个。企业集团和群体由过去单一同类产品的加工联合，发展为原有材料基地、加工企业、销售渠道和科研、教育、金融界参加的多元型一体化的新格局，使区域内各种生产要素得到优化组合，生产、流通环节趋向协调运转。参加“熊猫”电子集团的企业由过去的116家，增加到164家，集团产值已达8亿元。
    商品、物资、金融、科技四大市场活跃，为区域经济发展提供了良好的服务。一年来区域内商品流通经销额达40多亿元，对缓解区域市场供应，平衡物价，稳定市场秩序起了重要作用。
    依托南京、镇江、扬州的优惠政策和港口，区域经济在利用外资、劳务输出、“三来一补”、外汇、调剂、委托、代理、转口贸易等方面，发展了本地市的外向型经济，扩大了出口创汇。驰名中外的镇江香醋为扩大出口，组建了“中国镇江恒顺集团”，扬州、淮南等地9家企业参加集团，开展协作，扩大了镇江香醋产量的出口量。
