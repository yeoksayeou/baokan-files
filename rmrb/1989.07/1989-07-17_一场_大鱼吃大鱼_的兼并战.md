A "Big Fish Eats Big Fish" Merger Battle

	By Zhang Liang, Correspondent

	Recently, the merger and counter-merger battle between Time Inc. and Paramount Communications has intensified, becoming a hot topic in American newspapers. This is because the battle is taking place within the media industry and involves over $100 billion. If the merger succeeds, the new company will occupy a monopolistic position in the industry.

	This merger battle has a bit of a dramatic twist. In today's merger frenzy in the United States, not only do "big fish eat small fish," but often "big fish eat big fish." No wonder many companies are always on edge, fearing they might be "eaten" by unfriendly competitors. Even Time Inc., with $9 billion in assets, has such concerns. Earlier this year, Time Inc. heard rumors that it had become a target for acquisition. So, it took the initiative and reached a friendly merger agreement with Warner Communications in March, attempting to make itself an "unbiteable hard bone." According to U.S. laws, merging with another company requires approval from the company's shareholders. However, in the eyes of Time Inc.'s senior management, this deal was almost certain, and the shareholders' vote was merely a formality. Unexpectedly, just two weeks before Time Inc.'s shareholders were to formally vote, Paramount Communications suddenly launched a surprise attack, offering $10.7 billion to acquire Time Inc. Time Inc. naturally refused, stating it had never intended to be auctioned off. Subsequently, Time Inc. immediately changed its strategy and announced on June 16 that it would acquire Warner Communications for $14 billion instead of merging with it, changing from a merger to an acquisition, mainly for legal procedural reasons. Because when acquiring another company, the buyer generally does not need shareholder approval. On June 23, Paramount Communications raised its offer from $10.7 billion to $12.2 billion, but Time Inc. still refused to agree.

	Unable to settle privately, they turned to the courts. Paramount Communications sued Time Inc. for not fully disclosing the legal issues involved in acquiring Warner Communications and for not providing sufficient reasons for determining the value of Warner Communications' shares. Time Inc. retaliated, accusing Paramount Communications of fabricating various misleading situations when proposing to acquire Time Inc. In short, both companies, unable to swallow each other, are trying to defeat their opponents through the courts.

	Why has this merger and counter-merger battle become so intense? According to Time Inc., if acquired by Paramount Communications, the independence and quality of its publications would be compromised. Paramount Communications claims that acquiring Time Inc. is for competitive reasons. However, many people believe these statements are merely surface-level. The real intention of the senior management of both companies is to maintain their respective vested interests. It is revealed that the annual salaries and bonuses of the CEOs and chairmen of both companies are over $1 million each. If acquired by the other, their positions and incomes would plummet overnight.

	This "life-and-death" merger battle is still ongoing, and the final outcome is hard to predict. However, people seem to have seen an important reason behind the frequent merger waves in the United States in recent years. At the same time, it indicates that a clear trend in the development of U.S. companies is that their scales are becoming increasingly larger.

### 一场“大鱼吃大鱼”的兼并战

    一场“大鱼吃大鱼”的兼并战
    本报记者　张亮
    近来，时代公司与帕拉芒特传播公司之间的兼并与反兼并之战愈演愈烈，成了美国报刊的热门话题。这是因为，一是发生在传播媒介内部，二是牵动100多亿美元巨款，如果兼并成功，新的公司在同行中将占据某种垄断地位。
    这场兼并战颇有点戏剧性。在当今兼并风潮盛行的美国，不仅“大鱼吃小鱼”，而且还常常出现“大鱼吃大鱼”的局面，难怪许多公司总是紧张不安，生怕被不友好的竞争对手“吃掉”。连拥有90亿美元资产的时代公司也有这种担心。今年早些时候，时代公司就听到风声，它已成为兼并对象。于是它来了个先声夺人，于3月间同沃纳传播公司达成友好合并协议，试图使自己成为一根“啃不动的硬骨头”。根据美国有关法律，与另一公司合并，需获得本公司股东的批准。然而，在时代公司的高层管理人员看来，这笔交易已十拿九稳，股东的表决无非是一种形式。不料，就在时代公司的股东们准备正式投票表决的前两个星期，帕拉芒特传播公司突然袭击，提出要出价107亿美元购买时代公司。时代公司当然不干，声称它从未想拍卖，随后时代公司立即改变战略，于6月16日宣布以140亿美元购买沃纳公司，而不是同它合并，由合并变成购买，主要是出于法律程序上的考虑。因为购买另一家公司时，买主一般不需获得股东的批准。6月23日，帕拉芒特公司出价加码，由107亿升至122亿美元，但时代公司当然还是拒不同意。
    私了不成，便上诉法院。帕拉芒特公司控告时代公司未详细说明购买沃纳公司涉及的有关法律问题，也没有说明确定沃纳公司股票每股金额的充足理由。而时代公司则针锋相对，指控帕拉芒特公司在提出购买时代公司时编造了各种迷惑人的假情况。总之，两家在吞并对方不成的情况下，都想通过法院挫败对手。
    这场兼并与反兼并之战为何闹得如此不可开交呢？按照时代公司的说法，如果被帕拉芒特公司兼并，其出版物的“言论独立性和质量就会受到损害”。帕拉芒特公司则声称，兼并时代公司是出于竞争力的考虑。但是，许多人认为上述说法都不过是表面文章，两家公司高层管理人员的真正目的是试图维护他们各自的既得利益。据透露，这两家公司的总裁和董事长的年薪加奖金都在100万美元以上。如果被对方兼并，其地位和收入就会在一夜之间急转直下。
    这场“你死我活”的兼并战仍在进行，最后结局也尚难预料，但人们似乎已从中看出了美国近年来兼并风潮迭起的一个重要原因。同时，它还表明，美国公司的一个明显发展趋势是规模越来越大。
