From Tokyo, driving southwest along the expressway for 16 hours, one enters the Fukuoka Prefecture in the Kyushu region of Japan. To familiarize myself with the route, I bought a map of Fukuoka Prefecture. Flipping to the index, I saw on the second line, "The Gateway to the Chinese Mainland," which stirred my heart.

Fukuoka was formerly known as Hakata. Its latitude is similar to that of Lianyungang in China, and it faces the mainland across the Yellow Sea. Due to its geographical location, Fukuoka has had extensive historical interactions with China. It was the departure point for the Tensho Envoys, and the Honglu Hall within the city was a reception hall built during the Nara period to welcome envoys from the Tang Dynasty. During my visit, many Japanese friends mentioned that Shiga Island Gold Seal Park is worth visiting.

Shiga Island is located in the Hakata Bay to the west of Fukuoka, covering an area of approximately 12 square kilometers and connected by modern roads. Following the coastal road around the island to its eastern side, I saw a nearly 10-meter-high white stone monument by the seaside. The monument is inscribed with the words "The Place Where the Han Dynasty Gold Seal of the King of Na Shou Shuo Shines." Next to the monument is a wooden sign that reads, "This is the site where the gold seal, bestowed by Emperor Guangwu of the Later Han Dynasty (present-day China) to the envoy of the Na Kingdom (present-day Fukuoka and its surrounding regions), was discovered. It is also an important historical site in our country. The seal has been passed down for over 1,900 years and is now displayed here. From this vantage point, one can overlook Hakata Bay and Genkai Bay, and reflect on the exchanges between Japan and the Chinese mainland in ancient times, evoking new sentiments within us."

The back of the monument is covered with inscriptions detailing how the gold seal was unearthed: On February 23, 1784, during the fourth year of the Tenmei era, a farmer on Shiga Island was digging an irrigation canal when he accidentally discovered the gold seal. This confirmed a passage in the "Book of the Later Han": "In the second year of Jianwu, the king of Wa sent envoys to pay tribute and congratulate the court, and the envoys called themselves 'Taifu.' Wa is the southernmost region of the country. Emperor Guangwu bestowed upon them a seal and a ribbon."

Following the path beside the monument up the steps, I reached the first platform. Looking around, apart from the green mountains, lush trees, and vibrant flowers, there were three inscriptions to read. One explained the gold seal itself: It is inscribed with the words "Han Committee Slave King," where "Han" refers to the Han Dynasty of China, "Committee" is an old term for Japanese people, and "Slave" is the name of a small kingdom centered around Fukuoka in ancient times. The seal is 2.3 centimeters on each side, 0.8 centimeters thick, square-shaped, weighs 108 grams of pure gold, and has a snake-shaped handle. It is now housed in the Fukuoka Art Museum.

Yesterday, at the Fukuoka Expo, I saw another gold seal, sent from the Nanjing Museum for exhibition. It is similar in size and thickness to the Fukuoka gold seal, weighs 85 grams of pure gold, has a turtle-shaped handle, and is inscribed with "Seal of the Prince of Guangling." According to research, both seals were made during the Later Han Dynasty in China and are likely to have been crafted in the same workshop in Luoyang, making them "brother seals." After being separated for nearly 2,000 years, they met again in a foreign land, and people could not help but wish them well.

Turning around, I saw two stone monuments. One reads, "Water flows between the two cities, friendship endures forever," signed by Yang Shangkun in March 1980. Fukuoka and Guangzhou are sister cities, and the inscription was likely written at the time of their friendship agreement. The other monument features a seven-character poem written by Guo Moruo: "Since the war, songs of friendship have been frequently heard, the sounds of Beijing seem like the Milky Way. The sea and mountains gather clouds and mist in the morning, and the city lights shine brightly at night. Cherishing old friendships, the exchanges are as solid as stone. Meeting people, one can only feel choked with emotion. This wood, what harvest will it bring? May we never again raise arms within our homes." Signed: Written in Fukuoka during a visit to Japan in 1955, and now it has been 18 years since then, winter of 1974, Guo Moruo.

Continuing up the path to the second platform, known as the "Directional Viewing Platform," I saw a large stone surrounded by many smaller stones arranged irregularly. After examining them for a while, I understood the mystery between the stones. The designer used the large stone as the base of the Gold Seal Park, indicating to visitors the directions and distances of several places related to this site. On the east side of the large stone, a small stone is inscribed with "Tokyo, 900 kilometers." On the west side of the large stone, three small stones in different directions are inscribed with "Beijing, 1400 kilometers," "Luoyang, 1600 kilometers," and "Guangzhou, 2020 kilometers."

Descending the steps slowly, I couldn't help but wonder who had ingeniously designed such a small and exquisite park, blending historical artifacts and stories from 2,000 years ago with the directions and distances of several cities. Perhaps the designer's intention was to use this clever combination to imply that the friendly exchanges between different nations, tested by time and space, grow stronger with each passing day and will endure forever.

    志贺岛金印公园
    于青
    出东京，沿高速公路，向西南方向驱车16个小时，进入日本九州地区的福冈县境内。为熟悉路径买了本福冈县地图，翻至目录，只见第二行上写着“通往中国大陆的门户”，心头不觉一动。
    福冈古称博岛，纬度相当于中国的连云港市，隔黄海与大陆相望，由于地理关系，福冈在历史上与中国交往甚多。这里曾是遣唐使出发之地，市内的鸿胪馆是奈良时代专门接待唐朝来日使者的迎宾馆。采访期间所遇日本朋友都说起志贺岛金印公园值得一看。
    志贺岛位于福冈以西海面的博岛湾上，面积约12平方公里，有现代化的公路相通。沿环岛公路行至志贺岛东侧，临海的公路边，立着一块高近10米的白色石碑，上刻“汉委奴国王金印发光之处”数字。石碑旁有一块木牌，写着“此处是发现后汉（现在的中国）光武帝授予奴国（现在以福冈为中心地区）使者金印之地，也是我国历史上重要之地。印绶传来至今，历时1900余年。现在立于此地，眺望博岛湾和玄界湾，遥想当年和中国大陆之交流，不由唤起我们新的感慨。”
    碑身后面刻满了字，大意是介绍金印如何出土：天明4年（公元1784年）2月23日，志贺岛上一农夫修田间水渠时，偶然挖出金印。由此证实了《后汉书》中的一段记载：“建武中元二年倭奴中奉贡朝贺，使人自称大夫，倭国之极南界也。光武帝赐以印绶。”
    顺石碑旁山路拾级而上，登至第一平台，环顾四周，除青山绿树鲜花之外，有三处字迹可看。一处详解金印本身：上刻“汉委奴国王”五字，“汉”是中国汉朝，“委”是对日本人的旧称，“奴”是以福冈为中心的当年一小国家名称。金印边长2.3厘米、厚0.8厘米、正方形、重108克纯金、印柄为蛇，现藏于福冈美术馆。
    联想起昨日在福冈博览会上见到的另一颗金印，是南京博物馆送来参展的，大小厚薄与福冈出土金印相似，重85克纯金，印柄为龟，铭文是“广陵王玺”。据考证，两颗金印均制于中国后汉年间，极有可能是出于当时洛阳城内同一工房的“兄弟印”。兄弟分手约2000年后，异国相见，人们无不为之祝福。
    转过身来看两块石碑。一块上写“带水横陈两市　相望友谊永恒”，落款：杨尚昆　1980年3月。福冈市和广州市是友好城市，铭文许是写于缔结之时。另一块碑文是郭沫若手迹的七绝，诗曰：“战后频传友谊歌，北京声浪似银河。海山云雾朝相集，市井霓虹入夜多。怀旧幸坚交似石，逢人但见哽生窝。此木收获将何以，永不重操室内戈。”落款：一九五五年访问日本归还　在福冈作　转瞬已十八
            年矣一九七四年冬　郭沫若。
    再顺山路登上第二平台，此处名为“方位广场展望所”。地面上，围绕一块大石块，四周不规则摆放着许多小石块。端详许久，才明白石块间的奥妙。设计者是把大石块作为金印公园，以此为基地，告知游人一些与此地关系密切地方的方向和距离。在大石块的东侧，一个小石块刻着“东京900公里”。在大石块的西侧不同方位的3个小石块上分别刻着：北京1400公里，洛阳1600公里，广州2020公里。
    沿着石阶缓缓下行，情不自禁地揣测，是谁匠心独运地设计出这样一个小巧别致的公园，把2000年历史中的文物、佳话，同若干城市的方位、距离揉为一体。设计者的构思或许在于以这种巧妙的结合暗喻：不同民族的友好交流，经过时间和空间的考验，与日俱增、与世长存。
