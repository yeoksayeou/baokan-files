    Money Corrupts the American College Sports World

    Early this year, the American University of Oklahoma football team, which had won the national championship several times, experienced a series of violent and other illegal incidents.

    On January 13, a player drew a gun over a dispute about the ownership of a tape recorder, resulting in a former athlete being seriously injured. A week later, three players of the same team gang-raped a 20-year-old woman in their dormitory. On February 10, the team's manager was arrested by the FBI for selling drugs.

    Similar incidents have occurred at other universities. A new player on the basketball team at the University of Texas-San Antonio was sued for attempted murder after raping a female employee in a hotel. A football player at Clemson University was sued for fighting, and a football player at the University of Notre Dame was sued for fleeing after causing an accident.

    A women's basketball coach in New York believes that within the highest level of college sports, a structure that leads to crime has formed.

    High-level football or basketball games, broadcast by major television networks, bring in large sums of money for universities. For example, events during the New Year period can bring a school hundreds of thousands of dollars. Some universities, in order to gain such huge revenues, spare no expense in recruiting promising athletes from high schools. Thus, athletes ranked in the top ten of a state will have more than ten universities competing for them. These universities often violate the rules of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, buying high-end cars for high school students and promising high scholarships.

    The fierce competition among universities and the high material inducements make these young athletes, who have just graduated from high school, lose their minds. Their individualistic psychology becomes extremely inflated, leading them to do as they please and eventually to commit crimes such as rape and murder.

    Faced with the increasing number of criminal cases in the college sports world, some American universities are hastily taking remedial measures, such as considering a rule that prohibits athletes from training during their first year of enrollment to allow them to focus on their studies, and closing the high-end apartments for athletes, which are known as "crime breeding grounds."

    However, people doubt whether these ideas can be implemented. A coach believes that if athletes are prohibited from training during their first year, universities will not be able to cultivate excellent players.

    People see that the materialism in the American college sports world has corrupted the ideal that "athletes should be sound in both spirit and body."

    金钱腐蚀美国大学体育界
    村夫
    今年初，曾数次荣获全美冠军的美国俄克拉荷马大学美式足球队不断发生暴力或其他违法案件。
    一月十三日，一名选手仅为一台录音机所有权的争议，就拔枪射击，致使一名老运动员身负重伤。一星期后，该队的三个运动员竟在宿舍中轮奸了一名二十岁的女青年。二月十日，该队负责人又因私售毒品罪被美国联邦调查局逮捕。
    此类事件在其它大学也频频出现。得克萨斯—圣安东尼奥大学篮球队的新选手，因在饭店中强奸女营业员、杀人未遂被起诉。克雷姆森大学足球队员因殴斗、圣母大学足球队员因肇事后逃走被起诉。
    纽约的一位大学女子篮球队教练认为，在大学最高水平的体育圈内，已经形成了一种引发犯罪的结构。
    高水平的足球赛或篮球赛，因主要电视网竞相转播，给大学带来大量的收入。譬如新年期间的赛事，会使一所学校获得数百万美元。一些大学为了获得庞大的收入，不惜重金招募高中生里有希望的运动员。这样，属于一个州前十名的运动员，就会有十所以上的大学竞相争取。这些大学常常破坏全美大学运动协会的规定，给高中生买高级轿车、许诺发给高额奖学金。
    各大学竞相争夺和高额物质引诱，使那些刚从高中毕业的年轻选手昏了头，他们个人主义心理极度膨胀，为所欲为，最后走向强奸、杀人的犯罪道路。
    美国一些大学面对校园体育界日益增多的犯罪案件，急忙采取补救措施，如考虑规定入学第一年禁止运动员练习，以便使其专心学习，关闭被称为“犯罪温床”的运动员专用高级公寓。
    但是，人们却怀疑这种想法是否能付诸实施。一位教练认为，如果禁止运动员入学第一年训练，大学就不能培养优秀的选手。
    人们看到，美国大学体育界的拜金主义已腐蚀了“运动员不论在精神上还是在肉体上都应是健全的”这种理想。
