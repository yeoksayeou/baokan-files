In Southern Fujian, when young women get married, they traditionally cry and sing "wedding lament songs."

In the past, a girl's marriage was often decided by her parents and matchmakers. The girl knew nothing about her future husband's appearance, character, or family situation, so she naturally worried and cried. Thus, in the shackles of feudal arranged marriages, a girl's marriage was often unhappy. "Wedding lament" was a genuine expression of her feelings, and over time, it evolved into a form of singing with fixed tunes and rhythms. Additionally, when a girl cried and expressed her reluctance to marry, she would often curse the matchmaker in her lament songs. Through these sad songs, she expressed her pain at leaving her family, with lyrics such as "crying for parents," "crying for brothers and sisters," and so on. Whenever these sad words of parting from parents and family were heard, the mother would often sing a "persuasion song" to comfort her: "Grandma, grandma, I don't want to marry. Golden girl, you should marry. Hard work will feed you, and the red envelope with money will come to marry you. New pillow, no grease, new mosquito net, no mosquitoes buzzing, new quilt, no bedbugs, new table and cabinet, dragging along." In this way, mothers, sisters, aunts, and nieces would take turns crying, each crying and weeping, filling the room with sobs, known as "full-room crying." Whether the crying was truly sad or contained joy, it needed to be savored slowly. Over time, people in Southern Fujian came to regard whether a woman could cry at her wedding as a measure of her intelligence and virtue.

Even today, the ancient custom of "wedding lament" still exists in the countryside of Southern Fujian.

### 闽南民间哭嫁

    闽南民间哭嫁
    闽南民间的少女出嫁时要长哭当笑，并唱“哭嫁歌”。
    原来，旧时姑娘的婚事大都是“父母之命，媒妁之言”决定的。姑娘对夫君的容貌、为人、家况一无所知，不免担心流泪。所以在封建买卖婚姻的桎梏中，姑娘的婚事不如意，
  “哭嫁”发自心声也是人之常情。于是哭嫁成为妇女发泄内心感情的独特表达形式，相沿成习，演化成有一定调式和韵律的哭调。此外少女每当哭到不愿嫁时，自然要通过哭嫁歌把媒婆骂个狗血喷头。借一曲悲歌，抒发离别亲人的痛苦心情，内容有“哭父母”、“哭兄弟姐妹”……每当听到这种惜别父母、家庭的伤感哭词，为母的往往要唱《劝嫁歌》慰藉：“阿奶阿奶我不嫁，金囡命囡你应嫁，苦工饲你大，红包钱银要来娶，新枕头，无油九（油垢），新蚊帐，无蚊吼，新被无胶蚤（跳蚤），新桌柜，拖着啦啦走。”如此者，母女、姐妹、姑嫂轮番而哭，你哭我泣，满堂大哭起来，是谓“满堂哭”。至于哭得果真伤悲，泪中可含喜悦，还需慢慢回味。久而久之，闽南人把是否会哭嫁，竟作为衡量女子才智和贤德的标准。
    闽南乡间至今仍遗存着古老的“哭嫁”奇俗。
