The Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council send a letter of condolence to the military and civilians in the disaster-stricken areas of Sichuan. The central condolence delegation arrived in Chongqing yesterday.

New China News Agency, Beijing, July 22 - Condolence Letter

To the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, the Provincial People's Government, Chengdu Military Region, Sichuan Provincial Military Region, and to the Party Committees and People's Governments of the cities and counties affected by the severe floods, as well as to the broad cadres, masses, People's Liberation Army soldiers, and armed police officers:

Since late June this year, parts of Fujian, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei provinces have experienced continuous heavy rains, resulting in floods and waterlogging disasters, causing significant losses. The situation on the Yangtze and Huai Rivers was once critical. The Central Committee and the State Council have been deeply concerned about this. Recently, the eastern part of Sichuan experienced unprecedented heavy rains, leading to landslides, mudslides, and rapid water surges. Nanchong, Dazhou, Wanxian, Fuling, and Chongqing have suffered severe disasters. So far, more than 800 people have died, and state and people's property have suffered enormous losses. The Central Committee has decided to send a condolence delegation to express heartfelt condolences to the cadres, masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and armed police who are fighting on the front lines of flood control and rescue.

After the disaster, the Sichuan Provincial Committee, the Provincial People's Government, the Chengdu Military Region, the Sichuan Provincial Military Region, and leaders of various levels of party, government, and military organizations have personally directed the flood control and disaster relief efforts in the affected areas. The broad cadres, masses, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and armed police officers, especially the Communist Party members, have carried forward the glorious traditions of our party and army, fearlessly rushing to the front lines of flood control and rescue, saving many people and a large amount of state and people's property. At the same time, they have promptly arranged for the living conditions of the people, organized production and self-recovery, achieving significant results and greatly reducing the losses caused by the floods. This once again proves that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, as long as the broad cadres and masses unite closely, share weal and woe, and fight together, any difficulties and obstacles can be overcome. It also powerfully demonstrates that our party organizations and people's army at all levels can withstand any severe tests and are indeed the vanguard of the proletariat and the faithful defenders of the people's interests.

The Central Committee and the State Council hope that the broad cadres, Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and the masses, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and armed police officers in the disaster-stricken areas will, under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and under the leadership of the party committees and governments at all levels, continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and indomitable courage. They should strive to quickly restore production, rebuild homes, and achieve greater victories in the anti-disaster struggle.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
The State Council

    中央慰问团昨天抵达重庆
    新华社北京7月22日电  慰问信
    中共四川省委、省人民政府，成都军区，四川省军区，并转遭受严重水灾的各地、市、县党委、人民政府和广大干部、群众、人民解放军指战员及武警官兵：
    今年6月下旬以来，福建、江西、浙江、安徽、湖南、湖北等省部分地区连降暴雨，先后发生洪涝灾害，遭受了较大损失，长江、淮河汛情曾一度告急，中央和国务院对此十分关心。最近，川东地区又发生了历史上罕见的特大暴雨，造成山体滑坡，泥石流暴发，洪水猛涨，南充、达县、万县、涪陵及重庆等地市遭受了严重灾害。目前已死亡800余人，国家和人民的财产受到巨大损失。中央决定派出慰问团，向灾区的广大干部群众和奋战在抗洪抢险第一线的各级干部、人民解放军指战员、武警官兵表示亲切的慰问。
    灾害发生后，四川省委、省人民政府、成都军区、四川省军区以及各级党政军领导同志，亲临灾区指挥抗洪救灾；广大干部群众、人民解放军指战员、武警官兵，特别是共产党员发扬了我党、我军的光荣传统，奋不顾身，立即投入抗洪抢险，抢救出许多群众及大量国家和人民财产。同时，及时安排群众生活，组织生产自救，取得了很大成绩，大大减轻了水灾损失。这又一次证明，在中国共产党领导下，只要广大干部和群众紧密团结，同甘共苦，共同战斗，任何艰难险阻都是可以克服的。同时也雄辩地证明，我们的各级党组织和人民军队是经得起任何严峻形势考验的，不愧为无产阶级的先锋队和人民利益的忠实捍卫者。
    党中央、国务院希望灾区广大干部、共产党员、共青团员和人民群众、解放军指战员、武警官兵同志们，在党的十三届四中全会精神指引下，在各级党委和政府领导下，继续发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗、英勇顽强的革命精神，再接再厉，千方百计地尽快恢复生产，重建家园，夺取抗灾斗争的更大胜利。
