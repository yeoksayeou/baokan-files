Title: "Opening the Floodgates" and "Building Dams" Sprouting

The phrases "opening the floodgates" and "building dams" are metaphorical expressions used to describe certain individuals' approaches to problem-solving. While their forms of expression differ, both are equally harmful and cannot be overlooked.

The author knows a former leader who, shortly after retiring, was known as "Old Principle," commanding respect. However, towards the end of his tenure, he used his so-called "twilight power" to promote unqualified officials and approve inappropriate favors, believing that by opening the "floodgates" today, he could secure his future. Unfortunately, he found that those who benefited showed no gratitude; worse, he left his successor with a difficult situation. Whenever this topic is discussed, the person regrets his actions but only feels the coldness of society and the fickleness of human nature, failing to delve deeper into his thoughts.

There is another individual still in office but nearing retirement. This person is the opposite of the former: when an activist meets the basic conditions for joining the party, if it does not align with his personal will, he delays it with an "etcetera, etcetera"; in the use of cadres and professional title evaluations, anything that does not meet his wishes is blocked with the "building dams" method. As for whether the "dam" can hold or how long it can hold, he does not care, the important thing is to show his power.

Whether it is "opening the floodgates" or "building dams," it seems to be related to "vulgar relationship theory." These individuals cultivate their own people, appointing based on personal connections, all stemming from personal interests, naturally not considering the revolutionary cause. Through these two examples, I think of: such irrational and unreasonable incidents can spread unchecked, and people become accustomed to them, which is related to the flaws in our social life and the feudal thoughts in the minds of some cadres. The issues of "opening the floodgates" and "building dams" are not only matters that the party's ideological construction should pay attention to, but also serious enough for the party's disciplinary inspection departments and administrative supervision departments to address. I believe that by frequently doing some "closing the floodgates" and "opening the dams" work, we can timely prevent some mistakes and avoid small flaws turning into big errors.

### “开闸门”与“打坝子”草萌

    “开闸门”与“打坝子”草萌
    所谓“开闸门”与“打坝子”，是对某些人处理问题的形象化说法。一开一堵，表现形式尽管有别，但都危害匪浅，不容忽视。
    笔者认识一位从领导岗位退下来不久的书记，先前雅号“老原则”，令人敬畏。可在离休前夕，他利用所谓“黄昏权”，把不该提拔的干部“拔”起来了，对不该办的“好事”也开了“绿灯”，还以为今日大开“闸门”，可为自己日后留下后路，殊不知，摆在这位权倾势去者面前的事实竟是：得到实惠的，毫无感戴之意；更糟的是给继任者留下了难题。每谈及此，那人追悔莫及，但只是感到世态炎凉，人情如纸，未能向思想深层开掘。
    还有一位尚在任上，但也处在将退未退“临界点”上，此人与前者正好相反：有积极分子要求入党，条件基本具备，然不合“孤意”，对不住，“等等再说”；在干部使用和业务职称评定上，凡属不顺心遂意的，统统以“打坝子”手法待之。至于那“坝子”能否“打”得住，“打”多久，尽可不计较，快事只在让你知道本人厉害。
    无论是“开闸门”，还是“打坝子”，似乎都与“庸俗关系学”有关。这些人培植知己，任人唯亲，是从私利出发的，当然不会想到革命事业。透过正反两事儿，我进而想到：此类违情悖理的怪事，所以能够畅行无阻，人们见怪不怪，与我们社会生活中的弊端和部分干部头脑中的封建思想大有干系。“开闸门”、“打坝子”这类问题，不光是党的思想建设应该注意，严重的还要由党内纪检部门和行政监察部门过问。我认为，常常做点“堵闸门”、“开坝子”工作，可以及时防止一些失误，避免积小疵成大错。
