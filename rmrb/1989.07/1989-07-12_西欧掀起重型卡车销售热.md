In recent years, the volume of road freight transport in Western European countries has been steadily increasing. Taking West Germany as an example, the long-distance road freight volume in 1969 was 39.9 billion ton-kilometers, which increased to 78.7 billion ton-kilometers in 1979. It is estimated that by 1989, this figure will reach 108.8 billion ton-kilometers, nearly doubling the volume from 20 years ago. The situation in other countries is quite similar.

Consequently, the demand for heavy-duty freight trucks (hereafter referred to as "freight trucks") has also been steadily increasing. Last year, manufacturers sold 188,000 trucks with a load capacity of over 11.6 tons, which is 9% more than the record high in 1979. At the same time, the sales of smaller trucks have also been good. West Germany produced 120,249 medium-sized trucks last year, an increase of 12% from the previous year. Among the various trucks produced in Western Europe, those with a load capacity of over 16 tons have the best sales, with a 15% increase. People refer to heavy-duty trucks as "the most economical and flexible transport tools." Currently, automobile manufacturers have a full order book.

According to experts, the thriving business of freight trucks in Western Europe has its reasons. Firstly, modern business strategies aim for quick production, quick sales, and no inventory, which can reduce storage costs and accelerate capital turnover. Therefore, road transport is increasingly valued. Secondly, the European Community is about to achieve internal market integration. After the full opening of borders within the Community, it is expected that by the year 2000, the volume of road freight will increase by 40% compared to now.

However, "every advantage has its disadvantage." Due to the thousands of heavy-duty trucks speeding along Western European highways every day, the exhaust fumes they emit seriously pollute the air, and the noise from the vehicles also greatly disturbs the environment. This "public nuisance" phenomenon has increasingly drawn the attention and concern of the Western European public, who demand that relevant authorities take appropriate measures.

    西欧掀起重型卡车销售热
    士芳
    近几年，西欧国家的公路货运量持续增长。以西德为例，1969年的长途公路货运量达399亿吨／公里，1979年增至787亿吨／公里，预计1989年将增至1088亿吨／公里，比20年前增加近两倍。其它国家的情况也大同小异。
  于是，人们对重型运货卡车（以下简称“货卡”）的需求量也不断增长，去年制造商共卖出载重11.6吨以上的货卡188000辆，比1979年时的创记录水平还多9％。同时，型号较小的货卡的销路也很好。西德去年就生产中型货卡120249辆，比前年增加12％。在西欧制造的各种货卡中，载重16吨以上的销路最好，增长15％。人们称重型货卡“是最经济、最灵活的运输工具”。目前，汽车制造商手头上的订单是满满的。
    据有关专家分析，西欧货卡生意兴旺是有其原因的。首先，现代商业战略旨在快生产、快销售、不积压，这样，既可减少储藏费用又能加速资金周转，所以，公路运输日渐受到重视。其次，共同体即将实现内部市场的一体化。共同体内部全面实现开放边境后，预计到2000年，公路货运量将比现在增长40％。
    但是，“有其利必有其弊”。由于每天成千上万辆重型货卡风驰电掣于西欧高速公路上，排出的废气严重污染空气，而行车噪音也对环境造成很大干扰。这种“公害”现象已愈益引起西欧公众的关切和重视，他们要求有关方面采取相应的措施。
