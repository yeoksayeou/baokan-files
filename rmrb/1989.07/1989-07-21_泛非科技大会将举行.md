The deputy secretary-general of the Organization of African Unity, Mapuranga, said today to reporters that the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity has decided that the first conference of representatives of the Pan-African Science and Technology Union will be held in November this year in Accra, the capital of Ghana.

He said that this conference of representatives will approve the budget, action program, and regulations of the Pan-African Science and Technology Union.

The idea of establishing the Pan-African Science and Technology Union was proposed by the Organization of African Unity in 1987, with the aim of promoting scientific and technological cooperation among African countries.

Mapuranga said that the Council of Ministers also suggested establishing a special fund for African health development, proposed declaring the 1990s as the decade for children's survival, and called for convening the highest-level international conference to discuss children's issues.
