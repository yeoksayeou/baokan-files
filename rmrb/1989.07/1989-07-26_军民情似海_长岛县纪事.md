The Bond Between Soldiers and Civilians is as Deep as the Sea – Chronicles of Changdao County

On the eve of this year's Army Day, the Shandong Provincial Committee and the Provincial Government awarded Changdao County the title of "Model County for Supporting the Military and Caring for Veterans." At the same time, the Jinan Military Region called on its subordinate troops to learn from the deeds of the Changdao garrison in supporting the government and loving the people.

Military and Local Leaders Lead in Weaving Emotional Bonds

Early this year, the second platoon stationed in Beihuicheng Township, Shanhuan Village, Changdao County, had more than ten veteran soldiers retiring. The women of the village were busy selecting souvenirs for the retiring soldiers, and each family took turns inviting the veterans to dinner. The village party branch secretary, Gu Benjian, invited Li Fuhai, the cook who had served on the island for six years. After drinking three cups of farewell wine, Gu Benjian said, "Brother, you've been on the island for six years. I know your family situation. I've prepared 400 yuan for you here. When you go home, use it as capital to start a small restaurant with your culinary skills, maybe your family situation will improve." Li Fuhai heard this and immediately shed two tears. Gu Benjian then instructed him, "If it's still not going well when you get home, come back, and big brother will think of another way for you."

This is just one of many stories of Changdao County's people loving and caring for the soldiers. But what force makes the people of Changdao County so fond of the People's Liberation Army? County Party Secretary and County Governor Song Xiugong said: There is no love without reason. The island is like a boat, and the military and local authorities are like the two oars on this boat. Without either, the ideal shore cannot be reached.

Forty years ago, the troops arrived on the island with the mission of building the Changshan Archipelago into an "unbreakable, indestructible sea fortress." Since then, the slogan "Building the Sea Fortress Together, Building a Happy Life Together" has resonated among the military and local leaders.

In recent years, the Changshan Archipelago has remained a place where military and civilians "share one heart to guard the island and one family to build the island." From small tasks like providing water and electricity, pushing and pulling boats, to large-scale military construction and island economic development plans, they always put each other's needs first.

After the Party's work focus shifted, the military implemented streamlining and reorganization, reducing military expenditures. Meanwhile, Changdao County, with the implementation of the Party's policies of opening up to the outside world and activating the domestic economy, enjoyed preferential policies such as priority in technological development, talent introduction, material supply, and seafood price adjustments, and its economy developed rapidly. The island truly became rich, with an annual per capita income of over 1,700 yuan. Seven economic indicators, including per capita output and per capita profit, ranked first among the 12 island counties in the country. One side reduced military expenditures, while the other side became rapidly wealthy. Facing the economic disparity, the leaders of the Changdao County Party Committee and County Government could not sit still.

They proposed at a meeting that the County Party Committee and County Government should lead the call for the slogan "Rich Island People, Never Forget the Island Guardians," and decided to plan a thousand-acre seafood breeding area for the island-defending troops. Considering that the Jinan Military Region has more soldiers and greater difficulties, they also allocated 10,000 acres to the Jinan Military Region. As soon as the meeting ended, the main leaders of the County Party Committee and County Government went together to the military leadership headquarters to study and implement these plans.

Rich Island, Strong Soldiers is the Common Wish of Military and Local Comrades

The brotherly affection between the military and civilians of Changdao lies in their ability to put the fundamental interests of enriching the island and strengthening the soldiers above all else, taking each other's development as their own responsibility. Fishermen say: Enrich the island first to serve the country, serve the country by supporting the military; soldiers say: Love for the people is not deep, unworthy of being a border guard.

With the development of Changdao County's economy, electricity shortages became their biggest obstacle. The county government decided to lay four 11-kilometer, 70-millimeter-diameter oil-immersed submarine power cables across the Pengchang Strait (from Penglai to Changdao) to draw electricity from the provincial grid, solving the urgent need for industrial, agricultural, and fishing production on the island. The county sent people to find experts and professional departments, but they all refused due to the high difficulty of the project and the rapid water flow in the strait.

Just as the government was in a dilemma, the military leadership decided to take on this task. Deputy Chief of Staff Huang Yun organized a technical guidance team for laying the cables, first reviewing a large amount of domestic and foreign submarine power cable laying materials, and conducting multiple on-site surveys of the sea area to design construction plans. They also converted a 500-ton barge into a cable-laying ship; concentrated the forces of the unit responsible for submarine telephone cables and the shipping team to complete the laying task.

Strong electricity flowed continuously to the island, and the island's industrial, agricultural, and fishing production was boosted. The total output value the following year doubled compared to the previous year.

Soldiers strive to revitalize the island, and the people of Changdao also cheer for the military's martial arts and strengthening. The famous patriotic and military-supporting model of Leyuan Village, Cai Dayu, was the first to shout the slogan "Rich coastal people, do not forget the border guards." He heard that the reconnaissance platoon's annual office expenses were not enough for a table of island fishermen's banquet money, so he suggested that the village invest 4,000 yuan to raise 3 acres of scallops for the platoon, increasing the platoon's annual income by more than 10,000 yuan. He saw that the platoon of more than a hundred people were watching a small black-and-white TV, and there was a lack of a decent entertainment venue, so he discussed with the villagers to buy a large color TV for the platoon. This color TV has been collected as the first "military-supporting color TV" in the entire army and is now on display at the Military Museum in Beijing. By 1987, the production income of each platoon in the island garrison had exceeded 10,000 yuan.

The "military-supporting fund" on Daoji Island's Zhongcun has donations from village-owned enterprises, economic cooperatives, and the public, totaling more than 5,000 yuan. They used 1,000 yuan of this to help the platoon build an entertainment room and used part of it to help soldiers solve family difficulties.

Military training is usually a routine matter. But the people of Changdao consider it a big deal. The party committee secretary of Nanhuicheng Township, where the troops are stationed, personally took charge of the telephone line maintenance team during the artillery live-fire shooting, ensuring the smooth conduct of the shooting. Last July, the higher authorities went to Daqin Island to inspect the military training of the garrison platoon. The villagers heard that it was an inspection of their village's troops, so they moved the seaweed that was drying and cleared the area for the artillery.

The people of Changdao have thought of many ways to make officers and soldiers enthusiastic about loving the military and practicing martial arts, and to make them devoted to defending the country. The party committee and branch secretaries of towns and villages all serve as part-time platoon and company political instructors. In September 1986, a retired worker from Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, named Du, received a visit from a stranger who asked, "Are you Du Chuanqiang's father?" After receiving an affirmative answer, the stranger introduced himself, "I am Gu Benjian from Changdao County, Shandong Province. Your son is serving in our island. I am his part-time political instructor. This time, I came to Dalian on business and specially took a detour to find you."

He told Du that Chuanqiang had been doing well at work. But because you and your wife divorced and abandoned him when he was young, he has never forgotten his hatred towards you, and he doesn't work hard in the platoon. I came this time to invite you to the island together to do Chuanqiang's work, so that he can devote himself to being a soldier and defending the island. These words moved Du, and the two came to the island together. In Gu Benjian's home, the father hugged his son and cried. Gu Benjian spoke to this one and comforted that one, and the son's hatred disappeared. Du pulled Gu Benjian's hand and said in shame: Even I am not as good as you! Du Chuanqiang also changed and became an active and progressive soldier in the platoon. Other part-time political instructors also said, "We should bear half of the military's responsibility."

The Unshakable Tradition of Mutual Support

On a winter night in 1987, the sea was foggy, and a cable ship of the garrison deviated from its course and crashed into the aquaculture area of Lin Chunhou, a member of the aquaculture cooperative and individual aquaculture farmer in the 9th team of Leyuan Village, Nanchangshan Town, damaging the scallop aquaculture racks. Compensation for the damages was only natural. Aquaculture on the sea is complex, and the calculation of economic benefits has a large range of flexibility. The next day, the officials of Leyuan Village went to the military and said frankly, "This matter is up to us!" Later, the village officials also found the head of the cooperative, Wang Deyi, and the individual aquaculture farmer, Lin Chunhou, and instructed, "In the matter of compensation, we cannot treat the military as the Monk Tang, cutting it however we like." Wang Deyi and Lin Chunhou said, "We will definitely not take advantage of the military!" The village, after careful calculation, found that the loss was at least 300,000 yuan. They considered the military's financial difficulties and only asked the military to compensate 8,000 yuan, and allocated another 240,000 yuan from the village's public accumulation to subsidize the two affected households.

In the same year, Changdao County decided to lay a power cable from Nanchangshan to Daoji Island. The near-shore area of Daoji Island is full of the public's aquatic aquaculture farms, including a sea aquaculture area of the military. When determining the landing position of the cable, the military considered that wherever the cable passed, there would be losses. They decided to let the cable pass through their own aquaculture area, preserving the public's interests from being affected.

In some grassroots cadres of Changdao County, one often hears such words: Supporting the military is an old rule passed down by the elders, and whoever does not support the military, the people will not even vote for them.

The garrison officers and soldiers see the people supporting the military so much, and thus see the value of soldiers, the glory of soldiers, and are even more devoted to their service.

    军民情似海
    ——长岛县纪事
    王武　陈丹华　宋熙文　谭吉安
    今年建军节前夕，山东省委、省人民政府授予长岛县“拥军优属模范县”称号。与此同时，济南军区号召所属部队学习长岛驻军拥政爱民事迹。
        军地领导带头编织感情纽带
    今年初，驻长岛县北隍城乡山前村的二连有十几名老战士要退伍。村里的妇女们忙着为退伍战士选购纪念品，而且这家请，那家拉，争相请老战士吃饭。村党支部书记顾本健请来的是在岛上服役6个年头的炊事班长李福海。李福海家住贫穷地区。喝了3杯离别酒之后，顾本健说：“兄弟，你在岛上6年，你的家境我知道。我这里给你准备了400元钱。回家用它作本钱，用你的厨师手艺办个小饭店，也许家境会有转机。”李福海听到这里，立时流下两行热泪。顾本健又嘱咐他：“到家后如果还不行，你再回来，大哥另给你想办法。”
    这只不过是长岛县人民许许多多热爱关心子弟兵故事中的一个。那么，是什么力量使长岛县人民如此厚爱解放军呢？县委书记、县长宋修武说过：世界上没有无缘无故的爱。海岛好比一条船，军地好比这条船上的两支桨，离开了谁，都达不到理想的彼岸。
    40年前部队进驻海岛，任务是把长山列岛建成摧不垮、打不烂的“海上堡垒”。从那时起，“同筑海上堡垒，共建生活乐园”的口号便在军地双方领导干部中叫响。
    近几年，长山列岛依然是军民“守岛一条心，建岛一家人”，小至让水送电，推船拉船；大至部队建设、海岛经济发展规划，总是互把对方想在前面。
    党的工作重点转移后，军队实行精简整编，压缩军费；与此同时，长岛县则随着党的对外开放、对内搞活的政策落实，享受技术开发优先，人才引进优先，物资供应优先以及海产品价格上调等优惠政策，经济迅速发展，海岛真的富了，年人均分配1700多元；人均产值、人均创利等7项经济指标，列全国12个海岛县的榜首。一方压缩军费，一方迅速富裕。面对经济上的反差，长岛县委、县政府的领导同志坐不住了。
    他们开会提出，县委、县政府要带头叫响“富了海岛人，不忘守岛人”的口号，决定为守岛部队规划一个千亩海珍品养殖区。考虑到济南军区养兵更多，困难更大，再划给济南军区1万亩。会议一结束，县委、县政府主要负责人一齐来到驻军领导机关，研究落实他们提出的这些方案。
      富岛强兵是军地同志的共同心愿
    长岛军民的兄弟情谊，就在于他们能够在富岛强兵这个根本利益下，互相把对方的发展当成自己的责任。渔民们说：富岛先报国，报国必拥军；指战员们说：爱民情不深，愧当戍边人。
    随着长岛县经济的发展，电力不足成了他们的最大障碍。县政府决定在蓬长（蓬莱至长岛）海峡敷设4条各长11公里、直径70毫米的油浸式海底电力电缆，从省网引电，以解岛上工农渔业生产的燃眉之急。县里派人找行家和专业部门，都因为工程难度太大、海峡水流太急，无力承担而拒绝。
    就在政府为难之际，驻军领导决定把这个任务揽过来。副参谋长黄云组织了敷设技术指导小组，首先查阅了大量中外敷设电力电缆的资料，又多次进行海域实地勘察，设计施工方案。还把一艘500吨的驳船改装为敷船；把部队专营海底电话电缆的水线连和船运大队的力量集中起来，完成了敷设任务。
    强大的电流源源不断地通向海岛，岛上的工农渔业生产如虎添翼，第二年总产值比头年翻了一番。
    指战员们为振兴海岛努力，长岛人民也在为军队尚武强兵“加油”。乐园村著名的爱国拥军模范蔡大禹第一个喊出了“富了海边的，不忘守边的”口号。他听说特务连一年的办公费还不够岛上渔民一桌酒席钱，就建议村里投入4000元，为连队代养3亩扇贝，使连队每年收入增加1万多元。他看到连队百十号人围着一台小黑白电视机，又缺少一间像样的娱乐场所，便和村民商量，给连队买了一台大彩电。这台彩电已作为全军第一台“拥军彩电”，被征集到北京军事博物馆。到1987年，驻岛部队各连生产收入都突破万元。
    砣矶岛的中村有个“拥军基金会”，由村办企业、经济联合体和群众捐款，目前已达5000多元。他们用其中的1000元帮助连队建起了娱乐室，用一部分帮助战士解决家庭特殊困难。
    部队军事训练，本来很平常。但长岛人民却看成是一件大事。南隍城乡驻军进行炮兵实弹射击，乡党委书记亲任电话线路维护队长，保证射击顺利进行。去年7月，上级要到大钦岛守备一连考核军事训练，村民们听说是考核自己村的部队，便搬走了正在晾晒的海带，给部队腾出架炮场地。
    长岛人民为了能使干部战士热心爱军习武，安心保国，想了许多办法。乡（镇）、村党委、支部书记都兼职营连教导员、指导员。1986年9月，黑龙江省哈尔滨市的一位姓杜的退休工人家来了一位陌生人，问：你是不是有个儿子叫杜传勇？当对方作了肯定地回答后，陌生人自我介绍说：“我叫顾本健，山东长岛县的。你儿子在我们岛上当兵，我是他们连的兼职指导员。这次到大连办事，特意转道来找你。”
    他告诉杜师傅，传勇本来工作不错。但因为你们夫妻离异，从小抛弃了他，他对你们的憎恨一直不忘，在连队工作也不好好干。我这次就是来约你一起到岛上，做传勇的工作。使他安心当兵，保卫海岛。一席话打动了杜师傅，二人一起来到海岛。在顾本健的家里，父亲内疚地抱住儿子失声大哭。顾本健说了这个，又开导那个，儿子的憎恨消除了。杜师傅拉着顾本健的手惭愧地说：我这个当爹的连你都不如！杜传勇也变了，成了连队积极上进的战士。其他连队的兼职指导员也说，军队的责任，我们要担着一半。
        巨浪大潮冲不动的双拥传统
    1987年冬天的一个夜晚，雾海茫茫，驻军的一艘海缆船偏离了航线，冲进了南长山镇乐园村9队养殖联合体和个体养殖户林春厚的养殖区，挂破了扇贝养殖架，赔偿损失理所当然。海上养殖情况复杂，计算经济效益伸缩性很大。第二天，乐园村的干部到了部队，爽快地说：“这事就交给我们吧！”尔后，村干部又找到联合体负责人王德义和个体户林春厚，嘱咐说，在赔偿问题上咱们不能把部队当成唐僧肉，想咋割就咋割。王德义和林春厚表示：“绝不从部队身上揩油！”村里经过仔细核算，损失至少在3万元以上。他们考虑部队经费紧张，只让部队赔偿8000元，另外从村公共积累中拨出2.4万元，对两家受损户进行了补贴。
    就在同一年，长岛县决定从南长山敷设一条通向砣矶岛的电力电缆。砣矶岛的近海到处布满了群众的水上养殖场，其中也有部队的一块海上养殖区。在确定电缆的登岛位置时，部队考虑电缆通过哪里，哪里都会受损失。他们决定让电缆通过自己的养殖区，保住群众的利益不受损失。
    在长岛县的一些基层干部中，经常可以听到这样的话：拥军是老辈传下的规矩，谁不拥军，群众连选票都不投你。
    驻岛官兵看到人民群众这样支持军队，从而更看到了军人的价值，军人的光荣，也更加安心服役。（附图片）
