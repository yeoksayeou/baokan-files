With the rumbling of carriages and the crisp sound of whips, you break free from the icy shackles of winter, revealing a fresh smile. The blue sky moistens this pleasant moment with large clusters of white jasmine tears.

Footsteps tread upon the damp yellow earth, leaving a row of faltering footprints. Behind you, the land opens page after page of its glossy black book, allowing the gentle rain to read. The stubborn stones are softened by the wind, turning into a puddle of spring mud, splashing onto your trousers.

The children are the first to emerge from the sunny slope, waving green, downy flags. This is the land's earliest poetry.

The magpies convey the sentiments between people and the land with auspicious words, carrying the last shard of ice to the radiant sunlight, making spring even more vibrant.

From the pale yellow thoughts, embark on the path of life...

		Sowing Life

Oh, there's no need to chatter endlessly in a long pipe, taking out the hearts that have endured the harsh winter, asking the sunlight to carefully sift through them, and then soaking them in the warm spring breeze... You cup the sun with a moist heart, striding towards the fields. The wind waits for you under the large willow tree at the village entrance, kissing your rough fingertips, releasing a fragrant philosophy. Your heart opens the small window, floating out of the heart chamber, landing on your palm, emitting a pleasant sound. Holding a wisp of pale green morning mist, you solemnly raise your arm. A golden arc flows from your hand. The land opens its arms to embrace this sacred moment.

    走向田野（外一章）
    刘春雨
    以隆隆的车马和清脆的响鞭，挣脱了冬天的冰枷，你露出了清新的微笑。蓝天用大朵白玉兰的泪水滋润这惬意的时刻。
    步履在湿润的黄土地踩下一行趔趄的足迹。身后，土地打开一页页油黑的书，让喃呢小雨阅读。僵硬的顽石被风说软了心肠，化作一汪儿春泥，溅在你的裤管上。
    孩子们最先从向阳的小坡上走来，晃动着绿茸茸的小旗。这是土地最早的诗歌。
    喜鹊以吉祥的语言传递着人与土地的情感，把最后一丝冰碴儿衔给亮丽的阳光，使春天更加精神抖擞。
    从鹅黄色的念头开始，走上生命之路……
            播种生命
    哦，不需要在长长的烟袋锅儿里絮叨，把熬过严冬的心一颗颗拿出，请阳光仔细筛选，然后，浸泡在和煦的春风里……你用太阳掬着湿润的心，大步向田野走去。风在村头的大柳树下等着你，在你粗糙的指尖上亲吻，散发出芳香的哲思，你的心撞开小窗，飘然走出心房，落在手掌上，发出一种悦耳的声音。挽着一缕淡绿色的晨雾，你庄严地扬起了手臂。一道金色的虹从手中泻出。土地张开手臂拥抱这神圣的时刻。
