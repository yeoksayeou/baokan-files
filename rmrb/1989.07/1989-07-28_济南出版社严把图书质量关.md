Jinan Publishing House puts social benefits first. Since its establishment in September of last year, none of the 67 books it has published have had inferior content.

At the beginning of this year, the book market saw a surge in "human body heat" and "physiognomy books." Someone offered to purchase a minimum of 200,000 copies of a "physiognomy" book, attempting to sign a publishing agreement with the house. They firmly rejected this offer. They also resisted the "sexual love" craze, turning down more than 20 books, including "Four Mistresses" and "Wanton Women," that were offered with substantial financial incentives.

    济南出版社严把图书质量关
    本报讯  济南出版社把社会效益放在第一位，自去年九月份成立以来，这个出版社发排的六十七种图书没有一种是内容低劣的。
    今年初，书刊市场上出现了一股“人体热”、“相书热”。有人以最少包销二十万册书为条件，要与这个出版社签订出版一本“相”书的协议。他们断然予以拒绝。他们还顶住“性爱”热，对找上门来以重金相诱要求出版的《四个情妇》、《荡妇》等二十余种书，统统拒之于门外。
