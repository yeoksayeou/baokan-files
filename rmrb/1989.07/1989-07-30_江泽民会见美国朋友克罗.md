Jiang Zemin Meets American Friend Crowe

New China News Agency, Beijing, July 30 (Reporters Zhou Cixiu and Zhou Shuchun) — CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin met with Mr. Crowe, Chairman of the Crowe Company of the United States, and his wife this morning in Zhongnanhai.

Mr. Crowe came to China this time to discuss the construction of an international trade goods exhibition center in the Hongqiao Economic and Technological Development Zone in Shanghai and signed a memorandum of understanding with the Shanghai Hongqiao Joint Development Co., Ltd. on July 29.

During the meeting, Jiang Zemin commended Mr. Crowe for coming to China to sign an economic cooperation memorandum soon after the suppression of the riots. He said, "Although the social systems of China and the United States are different, this does not affect the development of economic cooperation and friendly exchanges between the two countries. China has always advocated developing friendly cooperative relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence."

Mr. Crowe is an old friend of Jiang Zemin. During the meeting, they happily recalled their past gatherings in Beijing and Dallas. Mr. Crowe congratulated Jiang Zemin on his election as the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee and thanked him for taking the time to meet with him. Jiang Zemin said, "Not forgetting old friends is a good tradition of the Chinese people."

At noon, Zhang Jinfu, Chairman of the China International Talent Exchange Association, met and hosted a banquet for the Crowe couple. He thanked Mr. Crowe for his long-term efforts in promoting talent exchanges between China and the United States.

    新华社北京七月三十日电　（记者周慈朴  周树春）中共中央总书记江泽民今天上午在中南海会见了美国克罗公司董事长克罗先生和夫人一行。
    克罗先生这次前来中国商谈在上海虹桥经济技术开发区建造国际贸易商品展销中心，并于七月二十九日与上海虹桥联合发展有限公司签署了意向书。

    克罗先生是江泽民的老朋友。会见时，他们愉快地回忆曾在北京和达拉斯相聚的情景。克罗先生祝贺江泽民当选为中共中央总书记，并感谢他抽空会见他。江泽民说：“不忘老朋友，是中国人的一个好传统。”
    中午，中国国际人才交流协会主席张劲夫会见并宴请克罗夫妇一行。他感谢克罗先生多年来在促进中美人才交流方面所作出的努力。
