North and South Korean youth students issued a joint declaration in Pyongyang on July 7, pledging to strive for the elimination of war dangers on the Korean Peninsula, the easing of tensions, the withdrawal of U.S. troops, and the realization of national reunification through the efforts of the Korean people themselves.

The declaration stated that under the principles of independence, peace, and national unity, North and South Korean students are determined to fight for the transformation of the Korean Armistice Agreement into a peace treaty and the signing of a non-aggression declaration between the North and the South.

The declaration also pointed out that North and South Korean youth students firmly oppose policies aimed at creating "two Koreas," such as "cross-recognition" and "simultaneous admission to the United Nations."

The declaration advocates that to achieve early reunification of Korea, while conducting inter-Korean government talks, civilian dialogues should also be promoted.

There should be multi-channel exchanges, contacts, and cooperation between North and South youth and students.

This joint declaration was signed by Kim Chang-rong, Chairman of the Korean Students' Committee, and Lin Siu-kyung, representative of the National University Student Representatives' Council of South Korea.
