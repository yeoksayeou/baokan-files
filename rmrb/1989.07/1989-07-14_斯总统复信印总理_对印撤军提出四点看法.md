Sri Lankan President Premadasa yesterday replied to Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's letter, outlining four points as the basis for discussions on the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka.

In his letter, President Premadasa noted that, first, the Indian armed forces entered Sri Lanka at the invitation of the Sri Lankan President with the aim of assisting in resolving the ethnic conflict and ensuring and restoring peace. Second, the agreement to deploy Indian troops in Sri Lanka is between the governments of Sri Lanka and India, with no involvement from any other parties. Third, the transfer of power from the Sri Lankan Parliament to the Provincial Councils is an internal matter. Any claim that Indian troops should remain in Sri Lanka until the power transfer is completed is not only incorrect but also impractical. Fourth, the Indian government has guaranteed that no one will be allowed to engage in activities against the unity, integrity, and security of Sri Lanka from Indian territory.

Premadasa stated that now, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have agreed to resolve the issue through negotiations. The continued use of force by the Indian troops is not only unnecessary but also detrimental to the resolution of the issue through negotiations.

    斯总统复信印总理
    对印撤军提出四点看法
    据新华社科伦坡7月14日电　斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨昨天在答复印度总理拉·甘地的信中提出了4点看法，作为两国讨论印度军队撤离斯里兰卡的基础。
    普雷马达萨总统在信中指出，首先，印度武装部队是应斯里兰卡总统的邀请进入斯里兰卡，旨在协助解决民族冲突、保证和恢复和平。其次，关于向斯里兰卡派驻印度军队协议是斯印两国政府之间的协议，没有任何其他方面的介入。第三，斯里兰卡议会向省委员会移交权力，纯系内政。任何关于印军应继续留在斯里兰卡，直到斯完成权力移交的主张，不但是错误的，而且是不现实的。第四，印度政府曾保证不许任何人在印度领土上从事反对斯里兰卡统一、完整和安全的活动。
    普雷马达萨在信中说，现在，泰米尔猛虎解放组织已同意通过谈判解决问题。印军继续使用武力不但是多余的，而且不利于问题的谈判解决。
