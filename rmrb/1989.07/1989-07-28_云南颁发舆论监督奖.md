Yunnan Province today awarded its first-ever Media Supervision Prize. Provincial Party Committee Deputy Secretary Nie Ronggui and other leaders presented certificates and awards to 32 winning units and individuals.

Early this year, 25 supervisory departments and leading organs in Yunnan Province jointly raised funds to establish a Media Supervision Award Fund for the "Yunnan Daily." The fund committee decided to hold an awards ceremony every half year.

A batch of letters from retired comrades suggesting that the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government take strict measures to stop the trend of indiscriminate felling of trees, as well as the reader's letter column "Why Does the Trend of Indiscriminate Felling Persist Despite Prohibitions?" after its publication, caused a significant response. The Provincial Government promptly convened an executive meeting to discuss forestry issues and proposed a series of measures. This set of letters won the first prize for media supervision.

    新华社昆明7月27日电　（记者鱼世昌）云南省今天首次颁发舆论监督奖。省委副书记聂荣贵等领导人向32个获奖单位和个人颁发了获奖证书和奖品。
    今年初，云南省的25个监督部门和领导机关共同筹资，为《云南日报》设立了舆论监督奖励基金，基金会决定每半年进行一次评奖活动。
    一批离休老同志建议省委、省政府采取严厉措施制止乱砍滥伐歪风的来信，以及读者来信专栏《乱砍滥伐风为何禁而不止？》发表后，引起较大反响，省政府迅速召开常务会，专题研究林业问题，提出了一系列措施。这组来信获舆论监督一等奖。
