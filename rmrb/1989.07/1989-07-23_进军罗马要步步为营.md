Winning at home and losing narrowly away, this is a relatively ideal outcome for the China-Iran football match from a macro perspective, and fans should be satisfied.

Currently, in the fifth sub-group of the Asian qualifying round for the World Cup, China has won four matches and lost one, while Iran has won five and lost one. Due to having more goals scored, China only needs to win against Thailand in the last match, regardless of the score, to qualify. This situation is very favorable for us because Thailand does not have the strength to stop China's advance.

There is no reason to demand more from the Chinese football team than they can deliver. Their level is still not high. Facing a strong team like Iran, the wish to win both matches and qualify early is something the Chinese team cannot achieve. In fact, the Chinese team has never defeated Iran in previous major tournaments, let alone winning in Tehran. This does not mean that the Chinese team's performance in the two matches against Iran, especially in the second leg on July 22, was perfect or that they have completed their predetermined strategic plan, which means there is no need to point out any flaws.

Firstly, after losing in Shenyang, the Iranian team was able to adjust their lineup and bring in new players just a week later, which proved effective. In contrast, the Chinese team's selection and tactics were insufficient, and the substitutions of Wu Qunli and Xu Shengqiao in the second half had little effect.

Secondly, after the Iranian team strengthened their defense on the wings, the Chinese team's offensive power was weakened. The absence of Xie Yuxin in midfield made the offensive tactics less flexible. Although the attacks on both wings were still threatening and resulted in two goals, they were not as sharp as in Shenyang.

Thirdly, in a match where the strength of both teams is relatively equal, allowing the opponent to score three goals in a row is a mistake that cannot be forgiven. It is known that a 0-3 deficit is usually irrecoverable in major competitions. Defending against long shots and set pieces has been a weak point in the Chinese team's defense, and this weakness has been exposed again when facing a strong opponent. The defensive issues need to be addressed further.

The Chinese football team is on the verge of qualifying for the group stage, but judging from the situation in several matches, the difficulties in marching to Rome are still great. The opponents after the group stage are not weaker than Iran, and some are even stronger. The Chinese team should still aim to play freely, travel lightly, and proceed step by step. Otherwise, even against Thailand, if the team starts the match as awkwardly as they did against Iran, a sure thing might not happen, and the victory might not be as sweet.

    进军罗马要步步为营
    本报记者　汪大昭
    主场得胜，客场小负，宏观地说这是中伊之战中国足球队较理想的结局，球迷们应当满意了。
    目前，世界杯外围赛亚洲区第五小组，中国队四胜一负，伊朗队五胜一负。由于净胜球多，中国队最后一场只要赢了泰国队，无论比分多少，都将出线。这一形势于我十分有利，因为泰国队没有实力阻止中国队前进。
    人们没有理由向中国足球队提出超出实际的要求，他们的水平毕竟还不高。面对伊朗这样的劲旅，两战全胜、提前出线的愿望也是中国队难以达到的。事实上，中国队在以往历届重大赛事中从未战胜过伊朗队，更不用说跑到德黑兰去打胜仗了。这不等于说中国队两战伊朗，特别是7月22日第二回合交锋中的表现已经尽善尽美，完成了预定的战略计划也不意味着无需再挑毛病。
    首先，伊朗队兵败沈阳后，时隔一周，竟能调整兵将，遣出新人，且上场生效。相比之下，中国队的人选和招数都显得不足，下半时换上吴群立和徐胜桥，作用不大。
    其次，伊朗队加强了边路封锁之后，中国队的火力难以发射，中场谢育新的缺席，攻势的调度变通不够。虽然两翼的攻击还是有威胁的，并导致了两次破门，但已没有在沈阳那场锐利。
    再次，在实力相差不大的较量中，被对手一下子连灌三球，应该说防守上的失误是不能原谅的。须知，0∶3落后的被动局面，在重大比赛中通常是无法挽回的。防远射和防定位球，过去曾是中国队防守中的薄弱环节，一旦碰上强硬的对手，这一不足又暴露出来。防守上的问题还要再下功夫解决。
    中国足球队小组出线在望，但是，从小组赛中几场球的情况说，进军罗马困难还很大，小组出线后的对手哪个也不比伊朗队差多少，有的还明显强于伊朗队。中国队仍应以放开手脚，轻装上阵，步步为营为旨要。不然，就是对泰国队，如果也像两战伊朗队开局的表现那样别扭，煮熟的鸭子就是不飞，吃起来也未必那么有味道。
