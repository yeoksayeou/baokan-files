Hunan Import and Export Corporation and 15 other units were found to have falsified documents and illegally purchased cars, and have been severely punished by the Changsha West District Administration for Industry and Commerce.

From September last year to March this year, Hunan Import and Export Corporation, Hunan Chemical Import and Export Group Corporation, and 14 other units purchased a total of 18 small cars, including Shanghai Santanas and Toyota 12-seater vans, valued at over 3 million yuan, from Hunan Import and Export Corporation's subsidiary, Xiangde Limited Company, and Hainan Huangya Industrial Company. These units, fully aware that small cars are strictly controlled items, colluded with the supplying units to sign false leasing agreements, use loans, or internal settlement methods to pay for the cars, thereby illegally purchasing the vehicles under the guise of leasing.

The Changsha West District Administration for Industry and Commerce reported this case to the Hunan Provincial Office for Controlling the Purchasing Power of Social Groups and obtained approval. They fined Hunan Import and Export Corporation and the 15 other units between 400,000 and 1 million yuan each, totaling over 9 million yuan. The administration also suggested that relevant departments hold the responsible individuals accountable for their serious falsification. The actions of Xiangde Limited Company and Hainan Huangya Company in violating national policies and providing controlled cars will be handled in separate cases.

    工商部门建议追究上述单位负责人的责任
    本报长沙电　湖南省进出口总公司等16个单位弄虚作假，违控争相购买小汽车，受到长沙市西区工商局的严肃查处。
    去年9月至今年3月，湖南省进出口总公司、湖南省化工进出口集团公司等16个单位，先后从湖南省进出口总公司所属湘得有限公司、海南皇亚实业公司弄进上海桑塔纳、丰田12座面包等小汽车18辆，总价值300多万元。这些单位明知小汽车是国家严格控制购买的商品，却与供车单位串通一气，采取签订假租赁协议、以借款形式或内部结算方式付购车款，名为租赁实为购买的手段，违控购买小汽车。
    长沙市西区工商局将上述违控购置小汽车的事件向湖南省控制社会集团购买力办公室汇报并得到批准，分别对湖南省进出口总公司等16个单位罚款4至10万元，共罚款90多万元。该局还建议有关部门对那些弄虚作假情节严重的负责人追究责任。对湘得有限公司和海南皇亚公司违反国家政策规定、提供违控汽车的行为，将另案处理。
