Recently, India and Sri Lanka have had a dispute over the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka. On July 14, the Sri Lankan Foreign Minister stated that Sri Lanka insists on July 29 as the final deadline for the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka; otherwise, the Indian troops will be considered an occupying force.

The Indian Peacekeeping Force entered Sri Lanka based on the peace agreement signed on July 29, 1987, between Sri Lankan President J.R. Jayewardene and Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. The agreement stipulated that the Indian troops' mission was to supervise the ceasefire between the Sri Lankan government forces and the Tamil armed groups, help disarm the Tamils, and maintain peace in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka.

Since July 1983, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) have been violently opposing the Sri Lankan government, demanding the establishment of an independent Tamil state in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, where Tamils are concentrated. The Sri Lankan government has launched several large-scale military operations against the Tamil armed groups but to no avail. The government's proposal to negotiate with the Tamil armed groups for provincial autonomy was also rejected. Under these circumstances, President Jayewardene sought help from India and signed a peace agreement with Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to end the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka.

After the agreement was signed, the LTTE initially agreed to hand over their weapons but soon resumed military operations. The Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka launched fierce attacks on the LTTE, capturing their stronghold of Jaffna and forcing the Tamil armed groups to retreat to the jungle areas in the north and east. Over the past two years, the Tamil armed groups, using the vast jungle areas as their base, have waged guerrilla warfare, causing significant losses to both the Indian troops and Sri Lanka. Reports indicate that over 800 Indian soldiers have been killed in the past two years. Nearly 5,000 civilians have died in the northern and eastern regions of Sri Lanka, and many public buildings have been destroyed. During this period, the number of Indian troops increased from an initial few thousand to 75,000.

The Sri Lankan government currently demands the withdrawal of Indian troops, and the reasons are analyzed as follows: First, the Indian troops stationed in Sri Lanka have failed to bring peace and security to the country. There is widespread dissatisfaction among the Sri Lankan people, and the calls for the early withdrawal of Indian troops are growing. The Sri Lankan government has clearly stated that the Indian troops have been in Sri Lanka for two years, "The Indian troops have not brought peace to the Sri Lankan people but have instead caused new chaos and hatred in Sri Lanka, making the problem worse." Therefore, the Indian troops are no longer necessary in Sri Lanka. Second, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit was originally scheduled to be held in Sri Lanka at the end of the year. As a sovereign country, Sri Lanka does not want to host the conference with foreign troops stationed in the country. Third, the Sri Lankan government has recently held talks with the Tamil armed groups and reached an initial agreement, believing that it has the ability to solve its domestic problems.

Facing Sri Lanka's demand for withdrawal, India believes that the agreement between the two countries has not been fully implemented, and the security of the eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka is still not guaranteed. The timing for withdrawal is not ripe. Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi stated that India is responsible for the safety of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka, "The agreement between the two countries has not been fully implemented until the Sri Lankan government has completely transferred power in the eastern and northern regions to the local government." He also said that the Sri Lankan government's demand for the withdrawal of Indian troops is hasty. India emphasizes that the withdrawal date should not be decided unilaterally by Sri Lanka but should be decided through consultations between the two governments.

In response to India's statement, the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry issued a news release in mid-June stating, "The invitation for Indian troops to enter Sri Lanka and the request for their withdrawal can only be decided by the Sri Lankan President." Sri Lankan President Ranasinghe Premadasa said in a speech in early June, "India has repeatedly assured us that they will withdraw their troops whenever the Sri Lankan President requests it." Sri Lankan Minister of State for Information Ranasinghe said on June 29 that if the Indian troops attempt to stay, Sri Lanka will fight them and drive them out. Sri Lanka also boycotted the SAARC Foreign Ministers' meeting originally scheduled to be held in Pakistan in early July to protest India's refusal to withdraw its troops.

The stalemate over India's withdrawal issue has cast a shadow over Sri Lanka-India relations. People are closely watching the developments in South Asia and eagerly hope for the early realization of peace in Sri Lanka.

    印军进驻斯里兰卡两年
    归通昌
    最近，印度和斯里兰卡围绕印度军队从斯里兰卡撤出的问题发生争执。7月14日，斯里兰卡外交部长说，斯里兰卡坚持7月29日为印度军队从斯撤出的最后期限，否则，印度军队将被看作是占领军。
    印度维持和平部队是根据1987年7月29日斯里兰卡总统贾亚瓦德纳和印度总理拉·甘地签署的和平协议进驻斯里兰卡的。协议规定，印军的任务是监督斯政府军和泰米尔武装之间的停火，帮助解除泰米尔人的武装，维持斯里兰卡北部和东部的和平。
    自1983年7月以来，泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织一直以暴力反对斯里兰卡政府，要求在泰米尔人聚居的北方省和东方省成立独立的泰米尔国。斯里兰卡政府多次向泰米尔武装发动大规模军事清剿：但未奏效；而它提议与泰米尔武装就实行省级自治举行谈判，也遭到拒绝。在这种情况下，贾亚瓦德纳总统求助于印度，与拉·甘地总理签署了关于结束斯种族冲突的和平协议。
    协议签署后，泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织曾一度答应交出武器，但接着又恢复了军事行动。驻斯印军向泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎组织发动猛烈进攻，并攻占其据点贾夫纳市，迫使泰米尔武装转移到北部和东部的丛林地区。两年来，泰米尔武装以辽阔的丛林地带为依托开展游击战，使印军和斯里兰卡都遭到很大损失。据报道，两年来，已有800多名印军士兵丧生。斯北部和东部地区有近5000平民死亡，许多公共建筑物被毁坏。这期间，印军由开始的数千人，增加到7.5万人。
    斯里兰卡政府目前提出印军限期撤走，据分析有以下原因：一、由于驻斯印军未能给斯里兰卡带来和平与安全，斯各界人士普遍表示强烈不满，要求印军早日撤走的呼声日益高涨。斯里兰卡政府明确表示，印军进驻斯里兰卡两年，“印军不但没给斯里兰卡人民带来和平，反而在斯里兰卡引起了新的混乱和仇恨”，“使问题更加恶化了”。因此，印军在斯里兰卡已无必要。二、南亚合作联盟七国首脑会议原定年底在斯里兰卡举行，作为一个主权国家，斯里兰卡不愿意在有外国驻军的情况下作会议东道主。三、斯里兰卡政府最近与泰米尔武装进行了对话，并达成了初步协议，认为自己有能力解决国内的问题。
    面对斯里兰卡的撤军要求，印度则认为两国协议未完全履行，斯里兰卡东部和北部的安全还得不到保障，撤军时机未成熟。印度总理拉·甘地称，印度“对斯里兰卡的泰米尔人的安全负责”，“在斯里兰卡政府没有完全将东部和北部的权力移交给地方政府之前，两国的协议就未完全得到履行。”他还说，斯政府要求印度撤军是草率的。印度强调，撤军日期不应由斯里兰卡单方面决定，而应当由两国政府通过协商作出决定。
    针对印度的上述声明，斯里兰卡外交部6月中旬在一份新闻公报中指出，“邀请印度军队进驻斯里兰卡和请求印度撤走军队只能以斯总统的决定为准”。斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨6月初的一次讲话中说：“印度反复向我们保证过，斯里兰卡总统在什么时候提出要求，他们就会在什么时候将部队撤回”。斯里兰卡新闻国务部长拉纳辛格6月29日说，如果印度军队企图赖在这里不走，斯里兰卡就将同他们进行战斗，把他们赶出去。斯里兰卡还抵制原定于7月初在巴基斯坦举行的南亚区域合作联盟外长会议，以示抗议印度拒绝撤军。
    印度的撤军问题陷入僵局使斯印关系蒙上了一层阴影。人们正密切注视着南亚局势的发展，并热切希望斯里兰卡的和平早日实现。
