The aerospace industry's work guidelines will not change, and the industry will further expand exchanges and cooperation with other countries—this was emphasized by Lin Zongtang, Minister of the Aerospace Industry, at today's press conference for the inaugural issue of the *China Aerospace News*. He also stated that China's aerospace industry will continue to follow the path of "military to civilian, domestic to international, self-reliance as the mainstay, and actively introducing advanced foreign technology."

Lin Zongtang further mentioned that in the first half of this year, the aerospace industry has overcome various obstacles and worked diligently to achieve "half the time, half the task completed." The industry's total industrial output value and realized profits have both seen significant increases compared to the same period last year. Major tasks are proceeding according to plan. Among these, the total industrial output value has already completed 51.2% of the annual plan, an increase of 18.4% compared to the same period last year.
