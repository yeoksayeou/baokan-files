Over the past month or so, Hong Kong's tourism industry has experienced significant fluctuations due to various factors. Many previously popular tourist routes have suddenly cooled down, while some less popular routes have quickly gained traction. Some travel agencies have encountered difficulties not seen in nearly a decade.

Facing these challenges, what are tourism industry professionals thinking and doing? The reporter visited several travel agencies and found the following:

Forced to Change Course

Hong Kong has over 1,000 registered travel agencies. Among them, about 200 to 300 mainly operate Chinese tourist group services. These travel agencies offer routes that extend from South China and East China to Central China, North China, and Southwest China. In essence, wherever there is an open region, there are Hong Kong travel agencies operating tourist routes.

In the past, with the arrival of June, Hong Kong's primary, secondary, and tertiary schools begin their summer vacations, marking the start of the year's longest business peak for travel agencies. However, this June, all tourist routes to mainland China, from east to west and from south to north, have almost come to a standstill.

Business is ruthless and cannot afford delays. Many travel agencies have had to urgently shift their focus.

First, they intensified promotions for medium and short-term travel routes to Southeast Asia, such as Thailand, the Philippines, and Singapore, all at once.

Second, they accelerated the development of some less popular tourist routes to add novelty, such as tours to Bangladesh and Nepal.

Third, they organized long-term tours targeting some residents' desire to travel abroad, such as trips to the United States, Canada, and Australia.

How effective were these measures? Huang Shixin, the owner of the well-known Kantai Travel Agency, which operates overseas tourism routes, sees it this way: changing course is a way to adapt, but it is not easy. It's like someone who has always been a journalist suddenly switching to being a technician, which may not go smoothly.

Not Waiting, Not Losing Heart

The facts prove that this shift is indeed not easy, with numerous difficulties. Tourism industry professionals analyze:

The recent decline in Hong Kong tourists to mainland China is largely influenced by emotional and psychological factors. However, mainland China's tourism resources are abundant, a fact that no one can deny. After ten years of opening up, hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong residents and overseas tourists have visited the mainland. With numerous tourist attractions and relatively low costs, it is very attractive. Compared to these two factors, the emotional influence is ultimately short-term and will gradually improve over time as people gain a better understanding of the mainland. In contrast, the attraction of mainland tourism resources is long-term and more fundamental.

The reporter observed that despite the recent slowdown in tourism from Hong Kong and Macau to mainland China, in large and small travel agency business outlets, promotional brochures for "China Tours" are still stacked high, attracting the attention of tourists. Many people cannot help but pick them up and flip through them.

Recently, tourism bureaus from Beijing, Guilin, Guangdong, and other places have sent invitations to their counterparts here, asking them to visit, observe, and discuss. Industry insiders here have already taken this as a signal, passing it along to each other. Some industry experts also hope that mainland tourism departments will genuinely advance tourism business.

The Hong Kong China Travel Service, which has a 60-year history and focuses on developing Chinese tourism, sent a group of business elites at the end of June, led by the main person in charge, to directly inspect the actual situation of various tourist spots in East China, Fujian, Guangdong, Guilin, and other places. This action has attracted much attention and is considered by peers to have "set a precedent."

Hoping for Stability

The development of tourism, like the development of other economic endeavors, requires a stable environment and a harmonious atmosphere.

A veteran in the tourism industry said: Over the years, Hong Kong has been called the "Pearl of the Orient" by overseas tourists, not only because it is a "shopping paradise" and a "food paradise," but also because it is relatively stable. In early June, there was unrest in Kowloon's Mong Kok, and some tourists from Southeast Asia who were originally planning to come to Hong Kong canceled their trips at the last minute. He sincerely hopes that both Hong Kong and mainland China can maintain a stable and good tourism environment.

"The China tourism route is absolutely indispensable," said Xiaojingxin, Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourism Industry Council. "Objectively, every year, many people go to the mainland, either to visit relatives, do business, or sightsee. In addition, there are a large number of foreign tourists going to China via Hong Kong. Their comings and goings bring considerable benefits to Hong Kong's hotels, restaurants, transportation, banking, and department stores. Although China tourism is currently sluggish, it will take some time to recover, but it will definitely recover and develop."

Yang Baohua, who works at the Hong Kong Great Wall Travel Agency, advises mainland China's tourism department: seize the opportunity, summarize, and improve. He believes that currently, the mainland tourism department has too many bureaucratic procedures and lacks effective coordination. For example, last year's ticket price adjustment by China Civil Aviation was not done well. According to flight distance, the adjusted price is still cheaper than foreign airlines, but due to insufficient prior publicity and lack of notification, the adjustment was quite large, leaving travel agencies helpless and their enthusiasm greatly affected. He believes that as long as China's political situation remains stable and the established open policy does not change, and the tourism department takes appropriate measures, the future of China tourism should be promising. His words are worth considering for our tourism industry.

A broad perspective is needed for the long term. The China tourism route is indispensable. Hong Kong is the closest to the water and sees the moon first. The Hong Kong tourism industry should not only have immediate adaptive strategies but also a long-term, comprehensive plan.

### 风物长宜放眼量——香港旅游业巡礼

    风物长宜放眼量
    ——香港旅游业巡礼
    本报记者  黄幸群
    最近一个多月来，香港旅游界的业务，在多种因素影响下，出现了很大波动。好些原来十分热闹的旅游线，骤然冷却；一些原来不是太旺的旅游线，迅速升温；部分旅行社的经营，碰到了近十年来未见到的困难。
    面对这一切，旅游界人士在想什么？做什么？记者走访了多家旅行社，了解到这样的景况：
    被迫转向
    香港有1000多家登记注册的旅行社。其中，主要经营中国旅游团队业务的有二三百家。由这些旅行社经营的中国旅游线路，从华南、华东伸展到华中、华北和西南。可以说，凡是开放的区域，就有香港旅行社经营的旅游线路。
    以往，6月来临，香港的大、中、小学陆续放暑假，对旅行社来说，也就意味着踏入全年最长的业务旺季。但今年的6月，所有中国大陆的旅游线，从东到西，从南到北，几乎陷入停滞了。
    生意场上岂容拖捱？许多旅行社业务紧急转向。
    第一招，加强对东南亚的中、短旅行线的宣传，像泰国线、菲律宾线、新加坡线，一齐上；
    第二招，加快开辟一些冷门的旅游线，增添新鲜感，如孟加拉游、尼泊尔游；
    第三招，针对部分市民意欲向海外远游的心态，组织一些长线的旅游，如去美国、加拿大、澳大利亚等。
    效果怎样？在香港经营海外旅游线颇有名气的康泰旅行社老板黄士心这样看：转向，是一种应变的办法，但并不易为。就像一个人一直当记者，突然转行当技工，未必就很顺。
    不等待  不灰心
    事实证明，这个转向的确不易为，困难相当多。旅游界人士分析：
    近月香港到内地旅游的少了，相当程度上受情绪、心理因素影响。但是，内地旅游资源丰富，是任何人也抹煞不了的事实。开放十年，已有数以百万计的香港市民、海外游客曾经到大陆去过。旅游景点多、费用较少，很具吸引力。两种因素相比之下，情绪性的影响终究是短暂性的，它会随时间的推移，随着对内地真情认识的增多而逐渐好转。而内地旅游资源的吸引，却是长期起作用的，更带根本性的因素。
    记者观察到，尽管这一段港澳地区到大陆旅游的生意少了，但在大大小小的旅行社营业门市部，“中国游”的宣传小册子仍然一叠叠地摆放着，吸引着旅客的视线，不少人不禁拿起来翻阅。
    最近，北京、桂林、广东等地的旅游局向这里的同行发出了访问邀请，请行家们到内地走走、看看、谈谈。此间业内人士已经把这当作一个讯息，相互传递。一些行家也希望内地旅游部门能切实推进旅游业务。
    有着60年历史、着力发展中国旅游的香港中国旅行社，在6月底便派出了一批业务骨干，由主要负责人带队，分赴华东、福建、广东、桂林等地，直接考察各旅游点的实况。他们的这一动作，引人瞩目，被同行认为是“带了个头”。
    寄望安定
    发展旅游和发展其他经济事业一样，需要有一个安定的环境与祥和的气氛。
    一位资深的旅游业人士说：这些年来，香港被海外游客称为“东方之珠”，除了它是“购物天堂”、“饮食天堂”之外，还在于它比较稳定。6月上旬，九龙旺角发生了骚动，东南亚的一些游客原准备来香港的，临时就取消了。他衷心希望香港和中国大陆都能保持一个安定良好的旅游环境。
    “中国旅游这一条线是绝对不可忽视的。”香港旅游业议会执行总干事萧儆新谈了这样的看法：“客观上，每年都有很多人到大陆去，或探亲，或经商，或观光。此外，还有大量的外国游客到中国去，取道香港。他们进进出出，给香港的酒店、饮食、交通、银行、百货等，带来相当多好处。眼前，中国线旅游虽然淡了，要再旺起来，需要一定的时间，但它终究是要恢复和发展的。”
    任职香港大关旅行社的杨宝骅先生寄语中国大陆旅游部门：抓紧时机，好好总结和改进。他认为，目前内地旅游部门管事的门道太多，缺乏有力的协调统筹。例如，去年中国民航调整票价的工作就没有做好，按飞行里程算，民航调整后的价格仍然比外国航空公司的便宜，但由于事前没有足够的宣传，没有打招呼，调整的幅度又相当大，令旅行社束手无策，积极性大受影响。他认为，只要中国政局稳定，既定的开放政策不变，旅游部门措施得当，中国旅游的前景应该是看好的。他的话很值得我们旅游行业思考。
    风物长宜放眼量。中国这条旅游线少不了。香港是近水楼台，得月最先。香港旅游界不仅要有眼前应变之计，还应有一个长远、全面的安排。
