Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 25th.

The Soviet Supreme Soviet issued an open letter to the Soviet people on July 25th, expressing understanding for the workers' determination to carry out reforms and eliminate bureaucratism. However, it believes that strikes and ethnic conflicts will only exacerbate the economic crisis and hinder reforms.

The open letter points out that recent strikes and ethnic conflicts in various parts of the Soviet Union indicate that the country's reforms are facing difficulties. The losses caused by the miners' strike have already reached hundreds of millions of rubles.

In response, the open letter calls on the governments of the various republics to immediately focus their efforts on solving urgent problems in food, transportation, commerce, healthcare, and housing.

The open letter states that the Soviet Supreme Soviet will pass a series of laws to guarantee the autonomy and self-management rights of labor collectives, allowing the republics to enjoy sovereignty and economic accounting rights, and creating conditions for the people to democratically elect power organs.

The open letter emphasizes that in order to fundamentally change the Soviet economy and people's lives, time, as well as persistent and honest labor, is needed.

    苏联议会发布告人民书
    罢工冲突只会加剧危机
    新华社莫斯科7月25日电  苏联最高苏维埃25日发布告苏联人民书，对劳动人民的坚决进行改革和消除官僚主义的愿望表示理解，但认为罢工和民族冲突只会加剧经济危机，阻碍改革。
    告人民书指出，最近苏联各地发生的罢工和民族冲突表明，苏联的改革正处在困难时期。矿工罢工造成的损失已达数亿卢布。
    对此，告人民书呼吁各加盟共和国政府立即集中力量，解决食品、交通、商业、保健和住房等方面的紧迫问题。
    告人民书说，苏联最高苏维埃将通过一系列法律，保障劳动集体的自主权和自我管理权，使加盟共和国享有主权和经济核算权，为劳动人民民主选举权力机构创造条件。
    告人民书强调，为了使苏联经济和人民生活发生根本变革，需要时间以及顽强而诚实的劳动。
