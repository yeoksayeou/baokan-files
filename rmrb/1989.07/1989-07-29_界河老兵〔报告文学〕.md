Three rivers converge, a 1276-kilometer border river.

The riverbank has young and lush white birch forests, misty marshes, dense reeds, and many huts made of pine poles and wormwood, which house the soldiers patrolling the river during the clear water season. Who knows why Zhang Weixiang, a soldier from Anshan, still remembered to bring his slingshot to the army after enlisting. He tirelessly asked the old soldiers about the birds, including their nests, eggs, droppings, and their mating habits. Among the dozens of boat patrol points along the river, he found the most charming to be Fuyuan, where there is a "Bird Island" in the middle of the river. The birds swarm like ants, and their droppings turn the treetops white. Unfortunately, this small piece of land, which once belonged to China, was taken by the Russians a hundred years ago. For this, he was very dissatisfied with the Qing emperors.

On a beautiful morning in late April, Zhang Weixiang and his comrades saluted the general and set off down the river, beginning their six-month clear water season patrol. In their spare time, he would hold his slingshot and roam the bushes along the shore, hunting birds and beasts. He would dig out turtle eggs from the sandbank, tuck them under his armpits, and declare that in ten days, two small turtles would crawl out from under his arms. His slingshot was always tucked in his waist, but he lost the bullets for his assault rifle, first five, which he found; then one more, which he didn't find. The platoon leader scolded him, saying he was a coward and would send him home after two years of service.

At that time, the border river was shrouded in the cold war's shadow. One day, in a desolate and silent bay, two gunboats from the opposite shore surrounded their small boat. The boat captain—a veteran with small eyes, a bald forehead, and four worn-out uniforms—glared at him and ordered them to prepare for battle. Bullets were loaded into the magazine and then into the chamber. In the terrifying silence, Zhang Weixiang heard the national flag with one large star and four small stars making a creaking sound like metal plates being bent. A sense of sacred greatness and selfless mission surged and jumped in his young heart. He stared at a man on the enemy gunboat's deck who was taking photos, thinking, if a fight breaks out, I'll make his belly split open first.

From then on, he developed a sacred love for the border river. He confessed to me, "I can't do anything bad here. This is the border river. If something goes wrong, it could cause an international incident. Do you think this is a joke?"

In the summer of 1982, Zhang Weixiang became the platoon leader. It was a not-so-pleasant big "home." As soon as he took office, eight or nine soldiers insisted on being discharged. Their limbs, bitten by mosquitoes and flies, had turned into yellow sores oozing pus; their knees, shoulders, and backs were covered with rheumatism plasters, allegedly due to arthritis affecting even their hearts. They could not bear the loneliness of the wilderness, saying that the birds calling at night were all unpleasant, especially the screech owl's cry like a funeral wail, and the thrush's cry like a drowning ghost. There was also a bird whose call sounded like "gurgle gurgle," as if saying "go home, go home." They sang songs in front of Zhang Weixiang with strange tones, said provocative vulgarities, or deliberately knocked things over, all with the same goal—to provoke Zhang Weixiang. In the vast wilderness where there was no cinema or television, finding a matching opponent to fight with was not a bad pastime.

Zhang Weixiang hid his temper and launched an emotional "attack" on the soldiers. During the vegetable off-season, he personally rowed to the downstream of the Ussuri River to catch fish. In the chilly autumn, the river wind was biting, and for several days, he spent the nights in the burrows dug by badgers and wild boars on the deserted islands in the middle of the river. When he returned, the soldiers cheered for the salmon, carp, and pike, but suddenly found Zhang Weixiang lying unconscious in the cabin, looking like a corpse. His feet, soaked white by the river water, had new cracks like fish mouths, with the old ones gone.

He deliberately told his bitter love story: a neighbor girl frequently expressed her admiration for him, but unfortunately, she always found spelling errors in his letters. The girl gradually became intolerant, and her letters became stiff, finally ending this awkward love. His elder brother-like personal experience moved the soldiers, and someone suggested, "Why not start a cultural night school on each boat?" Thus, a wave of learning cultural knowledge swept across the border river.

He saved money from traveling on "bouncing poor" and "horse-drawn carriages" to buy cultural supplies for the soldiers; he used soft noodle soup to make sick soldiers feel the warmth of home. He often used his almost clumsy mouth to tell stories to the soldiers. On hot nights when mosquitoes drove everyone into their mosquito nets but couldn't sleep, loneliness and solitude hung over their lively hearts like a cloudy sky without rain. So, he would beg pitifully, "Let me tell you a story?" He didn't know how to tell stories, often leaving a story unfinished, with snoring all around. He would swallow the second half of the story, tuck in the mosquito nets for some, cover others with blankets, and then quietly go to sleep.

No one could say how the collective changed to be at the forefront. Anyway, after each annual commendation meeting, Zhang Weixiang always brought back several certificates.

Since a certain day in 1979, on the hard bed in the barracks, he completed his happy union with a woman named Sun Lijuan. He had been looking forward to the birth of a child. On the eve of the baby's birth, he was so happy that he almost forgot himself. He bought food that a two-year-old could chew, clothes for a three-year-old to wear, and intelligence pictures for a four or five-year-old to appreciate. He also prepared nearly a full company of male citizen names for the child whose gender was not yet clear. He took the riverboat, rode the horse carriage, drove the car, and chased the train, day and night, rushing southward. However, what awaited him was news that would make any man feel painful, embarrassed, and unbearable: his wife was "imprisoned" for "occupying" an uninhabited earthquake shelter in the factory; the baby, who was about to be born in ten days, was also "imprisoned." "The occupation is not false, the baby is about to be born, and we need to find a 'nest,'" the mother-in-law cried, "The factory sent people, the small door was bricked up, the big door was locked, poor my daughter, with a big belly, three meals a day were sent through the window, eating and defecating in the same place, like a prisoner..."

As a husband, he felt like a pathetic man, unable to fulfill the basic duty of finding a place for the young life to stay.

On that windy winter night, he climbed over a wall more than a meter high and met his wife, who was in her final stages of pregnancy. After crying, his wife told him that the worker who was ordered by the official to brick up the door was a good-hearted person. He bricked outside, and she cried inside. He asked her where her husband was stationed, and she said it was very far away on the border. He asked what job he did, and she said he was a soldier, driving a boat. He asked if he drove the boat to catch fish? She said no, it was a patrol boat, with guns, cannons, and telescopes. The worker exclaimed, threw down the bricks, and refused to brick up, "I am an old fool, I am doing evil, committing sins! Whoever wants to brick, let them brick, I won't brick anymore!" Zhang Weixiang's broken heart was thus comforted a little; the common people were still reasonable! He submitted a mild "protest" to the factory leadership and then mobilized his family to repair the earthquake shelter like a first-class combat readiness project, working twenty-four hours a day, demolishing walls, building walls, digging kangs, plastering roofs, and windows, and connecting water and electricity. Finally, they rushed to turn the four-walled earthquake shelter into a temporary "home" before the baby was born. He wrote in his diary: "Dear baby, I name you Zhang Jian. I have no high expectations for you, I only hope that when I dream of you, you will always be healthy. Please forgive me, the country is poor, and I can only let you live in an earthquake shelter for now, but there will be bread, believe me."

Was he considering demobilization?

In the winter of 1984, he visited his family again. It was still in that earthquake shelter, the kettle was hissing with hot water, and his son was snoring healthily in the quilt. He held a magazine and flipped through it casually, savoring the warmth of the family atmosphere. Suddenly, he felt a bit uncomfortable. He saw his wife rummaging through a wooden box, taking out one by one the window curtains, door curtains, tablecloths, and covers for the television and sewing machine that she had crocheted with needles. Each piece of fabric was embroidered with exquisite patterns. Six years ago, when he first saw these items from Sun Lijuan, who was still a girl, he had generously promised, "I will definitely let you live a happy life." However, six years later, he found himself a "liar," except for the pitiful salary he sent home every month after deducting money for cigarettes and meals, he had made almost no contribution to this family. His wife's white decorations, which she had woven as a girl, had turned yellow and old and were still useless. He felt very uncomfortable.

"Don't rummage, go to sleep!"
"No, if you don't, they will get damp over the summer, I'll dry them tomorrow."
"That's your skirt? You still wear skirts?"
"Why can't I wear skirts? Are you crazy!"

Zhang Weixiang smiled bitterly. Every six months of clear water season patrol and duty life, he couldn't take leave to visit his family, and his wife couldn't come to the team. Meetings were only in the depths of winter. He really wanted to see what his wife looked like in a skirt. His wife's figure could be said to be quite good. Clever Sun Lijuan suddenly understood her husband's thoughts and immediately took off her cotton clothes, put on a skirt, and walked around in the cool room; then changed into another one and walked around; then changed into another one and walked around. Suddenly, she threw herself into her husband's arms and cried. "Demobilize, even if you don't consider me, you should consider our son!"

Zhang Weixiang really got angry, wanting to use the opportunity of streamlining and reorganization to end his military career. He had a strong body nourished by the salmon, carp, and pike of the Ussuri River. His brain was not only not stupid but could even be said to be very smart. His leadership experience had accumulated rich management and interpersonal relationship experience. You say what to do, he was not afraid of anything! However, when he returned to the border river, where the sky was like a tent and the earth was vast, a sacred and grand thing infected him, attracted him, inspired him, and oppressed him. The thought of demobilization dared not show its face like a thief. Thus, he patrolled the border river year after year.

This old soldier, who had spent nearly twenty years on the border river, had a subtle and complex emotional entanglement with that piece of land. He cursed it as a "devil's place," accusing it of stealing the beautiful things that originally belonged to him. For example, his eyelids were originally thin and beautiful, but because of the reflection of sunlight on the river, he had to squint, resulting in thick, drooping eyelids. He also cherished it, protected it, and even did not want to hear others expose its flaws. He told me about the border river with the devotion of a girl:

The spring of the border river—The messenger of spring is the ice floes. The sound of ice layers cracking from far to near, like coming from the earth's core. When the ice mountains surge, the cold light flashes across the sky, ice blocks fly in all directions, and the thunderous roar shakes the earth. In this instant, a great excitement arises, as if nature has injected something into the earth. After the ice floes disappear, the first batch of early spring plants quickly bloom, red like a girl's lips, yellow like stars in the cold night. At this time, he and the soldiers would pick large bunches of flowers every day, putting them in various containers, turning the small patrol boats into flower caves.

The summer of the border river—Many evenings with glorious sunsets, they would wear hats made of wormwood to protect against mosquitoes, sitting on the gently swaying deck, watching various small animals foraging. Red foxes like spies chase after golden hamsters; small fish floating in water puddles, once losing vigilance, will be snatched away by crows like thieves; "neck-retracting waiters" like humans, stepping in the muddy water puddles, searching for small frogs, small fish, or grass roots, or slowly swallowing them, or finding something wrong, and then throwing them back into the water puddle with a strange expression. Nearby, the sweet songs of Hezhe girls might be heard, so they often argued: was she tall or short, beautiful or not? The argument usually had no result because they could not go over to see for themselves.

The autumn of the border river—When the maple leaves on the mountain turn from yellow to red, the birch leaves from green to yellow, and the autumn needles become even greener, the local farmers would remind each other in a joyful tone: "Five-color mountain! Five-color mountain!" Thus, in a few days, hundreds or thousands of fishing boats would appear on the vast river, and at night, the fishing lights would shine, almost like a city on the water. At this time, going out to patrol, the soldiers would surge with a sense of consciously linking their existence with beautiful things. In the hot and lively days of autumn, the soldiers would become more conservative and profound. Every movement and sound on the other side would not escape their vision and hearing. Sometimes, they even hoped for a small dispute on the main channel, so they could have a chance to show their loyalty.

He did not talk about the winter of the border river. After the beautiful autumn, the fleet would return to the inland river to "hibernate." At this time, everyone would suddenly find that the border river had tortured their bodies like a demon, so they would curse the border river with the roughest language. But soon, everyone would miss the border river like missing a lover, eager to open the river and fly to the border river like birds.

On that sleepless night, Zhang Weixiang told me a lot. He wanted to tell me this: Undoubtedly, he and his soldiers deeply loved the border river, and because only half of the border river was on Chinese territory, their love was even more special and careful. From the day they enlisted, they breathed the air of the border river, sucked the essence of the border river, and bathed in the scenery of the border river. The border river, with its entire rough and stern, primitive and ancient beauty, posture, and countless changes in color and demeanor, endowed them with spirituality and tempered their character. In fact, the border river had already merged into their lives. They could not leave the border river, and the border river could not leave them.

Salute, the old soldier on the border river!

    界河老兵〔报告文学〕
    中夙
    三江交汇，1276公里的界河。
    河岸上有年轻葱俊的白桦林，水雾弥漫的沼泽地，密不透风的针茅草，还有许多用松木杆、水艾蒿搭成的草棚，明水期住着界河上巡逻的水兵。
    鬼知道鞍山人张维祥当兵之后为什么还念念不忘地把弹弓子带到部队。他不厌其烦的向老兵询问鸟儿们的情况，包括它们的窝巢、卵蛋、粪便以及它们的性爱。沿江十几个船艇巡逻点，他认为最有魅力的是抚远，那儿的江心有个“鸟岛”，鸟群如蚁群，粪便把树冠染成白花花一片。遗憾的是这小块曾经属于中国的领土一百年前被俄国人占去了，为此他对清朝的皇帝们很不满意。
    4月下旬那个美妙的清晨，张维祥和他的伙伴们向将军敬过庄严的军礼，驾船沿江而下，开始为期6个月的明水期江上巡逻生活。闲暇时光，他手执弹弓驰骋在岸边的树丛里，射猎飞禽走兽；他从沙滩上掘出甲鱼蛋，挟在腋窝里，宣告10天后他的两腋会爬出两只小甲鱼。他的弹弓时刻别在腰里却把冲锋枪的子弹丢了，先丢了五粒，找到了；又丢了一粒，没找到。分队长兜头一顿批评，说他是孬兵，干满两年就送他回家。
    那会儿，界河上空笼罩着冷战的阴云。一天，在一处阴森死寂的江湾里，对岸的两艘炮艇把他们小艇包围了。艇长——一位小眼秃眉穿坏了四身军装的老兵瞪了他一眼，命令做好战斗准备。子弹压进弹仓，又从弹仓跳进枪膛，他选了一处最佳射击位置。可怕的静寂中，张维祥听见缀有一颗大星四颗小星的国旗发出嘎嘎嚓嚓的犹如金属板折裂的响声，一种神圣伟大的尊严感，一种忘我的使命感，在他年轻的心脏里滚跳升腾。他盯着对方炮艇甲板上一个举着照相机啪啪拍照的家伙，想，打起来，先叫他的肚皮开裂。
    他从此对界河产生了神圣的爱。他向我表白说：“我没法往坏干，这儿是界河，搞不好就出国际问题，你以为闹着玩吗？”
    1982年夏天，张维祥当上了分队长。那是一个不太美妙的破大“家”，他刚到任，就有八、九个战士硬要复员。他们的四肢被蚊蚋叮咬的地方已经演变成蓇朵般的黄疮，流着腐水；他们的膝盖、肩头、脊背贴满了风湿膏，据说由于关节炎的祸害连心脏都发生了故障。他们尤其不能忍受荒野上的寂寞，说夜间叫唤的鸟儿全是怪难听的，碜人猫头鹰的叫声如同嚎丧，麻鹇的叫声好似溺死鬼。还有一种鸟叫起来是“咕嘎咕嘎”，好像说“回家回家”。他们在张维祥面前阴阳怪气地唱歌，说一些挑衅的粗话，要不就故意把什么掀翻，所有这一切都是一个目的——惹怒张维祥。在电影看不到电视收不着的荒滩野原上，找个匹配的敌手打一仗不失为一种乐趣。
    张维祥藏起自己的火性，向士兵们发起了感情“进攻”。蔬菜淡季，他亲自摇橹去乌苏里江下游捕鱼。瑟瑟寒秋，江风刺骨，一连数日，他每夜投宿在江心荒岛上的獾和野猪掘就的土穴里。归来时，士兵们向鲑鱼、鲤鱼、狗鱼高声欢呼，却突然发现张维祥死尸样昏睡在舱室。被江水泡成白色的脚掌，原有的皲裂不见了，突现着一条条新的创伤，状如鱼嘴。
    他别有用心的讲述自己酸涩的恋爱史：一位邻家姑娘频频向他表示爱慕之心，令人生憾的是，姑娘总能在他的回信里发现几处错别字。姑娘渐渐不能容忍，信里的语句也生硬起来，终于使这尴尬的爱情夭折。他的老大哥式的现身说法使士兵们颇为感动，有人提议，每条艇都办一所文化夜校吧，于是一股学习文化知识的热潮席卷界河。
    他出差搭乘“蹦跶穷”、“马嘟噜”，省下路费给战士们买文化用品；他用香软的汤面，使患病的战士感受到家庭的温情。他还经常用他那张几乎算得上笨拙的嘴为士兵们讲故事。暑热久久不散的夜晚，大家早早被蚊虫驱赶进蚊帐，又睡不着，寂寞和孤独如密云不雨的天空笼罩着活泼泼的心，于是他便可怜巴巴地乞求：“我来讲故事给你们听吧？”他哪里会讲什么故事呵，常常一个故事没讲完，周围鼾声四起，他便咽下故事的另一半，为这个掖掖蚊帐，给那个盖盖被子，尔后再悄悄睡下。
    谁也说不清那个集体是怎样变化到先进行列中来的，反正每年表彰大会过后，张维祥总能捧回几张奖状。
    自从1979年的某一天，在部队那张硬板床上，完成了他和一位叫孙丽娟的女人的幸福结合，他一直期待着孩子问世。在婴儿降生前夕，他高兴得几乎忘乎所以。他给孩子买了两岁时才能咬动的食物，三岁时才能穿的衣服和四五岁才能欣赏的智力图片。他还给性别尚待分明的孩子准备了差不多一个建制排的男性公民的名字。乘江轮，搭马车，赶汽车，追火车，他昼夜不停地向南奔突，然而等待他的是一个无论放在哪个男人身上都会感到痛苦、难堪、无法忍受的消息：妻子因为“强占”了工厂的一间无人居住的地震棚，被“囚禁”了；同时“囚禁”的还有他的只需十几天就哇哇坠地的孩子。“占房不假，眼看孩子就落地了，总得找个‘窝儿’呀！”岳母哭述说，“工厂去人，小门砌上了，大门锁上了，苦了我那女儿，挺个大肚子，三顿饭从窗口送，窝吃窝拉，犯人一样……”作为丈夫，他感到自己是一个窝窝囊囊的男人形象，连为幼小生命找个存身场所这样一个起码的义务都不能承担。
    在那个风儿呼嚎的冬夜，他翻过一米多高的门墙，和已经进入临产期的妻子见了面。妻子哭过之后告诉他，那个被当官的吆喝来砌墙封门的老师傅心眼挺好。他在外面砌，她在里面哭。他问她男人在哪儿当差，她说在很远很远的边界。他说什么差事，她说是当兵的，开船。他问开船打鱼吗？她说不是不是，是巡逻船，船上有枪有炮还有望远的镜子。老师傅啊了一声，扔下砖头不砌了，“我这个老糊涂，我这是做损呢，造孽呢！谁愿砌谁砌，我不砌了！”张维祥破碎的心因此得到一点抚慰，老百姓还是知情达理的啊！他向厂领导提出了措词温和的“抗议”，尔后发动家人如同抢修一级战备工事一样，每天二十四小时作业，拆墙砌墙，挖炕修炕，糊棚糊窗，接水接电，终于抢在孩子落生前把四壁透风的地震棚修整成暂时栖身的“家”。他在日记中写道：“亲爱的宝贝，爸爸为你起名张健。我对你没有太高的奢望，只希望梦到你时，你总是一副健壮的样子。还请你原谅爸爸，家穷国穷，只能让你暂时住在地震棚里，不过面包总会有的，请相信。”
    他在打转业的主意吗？
    1984年的冬天，他又一次探家了。还是在那间地震棚里，水壶嗞嗞地冒着热气，儿子在被窝里奏着健壮的鼾音，他捧着一本杂志胡乱地翻看，用心品味着温馨的家庭气息，忽然地，他觉得有点难受。他看见妻子从木箱里翻捣出一件件手针勾织的窗帘、门帘、台布和电视机、缝纫机的蒙布，每一件织物上都缕绣着精美的图案。六年前，当他第一次从还是女儿家的孙丽娟那里看到这些物件时，曾慷慨地许诺：“一定让你生活得幸福。”然而六年后的今天，他发现自己是个“骗子”，除了每月寄家的扣除烟钱、伙食费的可怜的工资，他对这个家庭几乎没有任何贡献，以至妻子当姑娘时织就的雪白饰物发黄变旧仍旧派不上用场。他难受极了。
      “别捣弄了，睡觉！”
      “不吗，过了夏，都发潮了，明儿个晒晒。”
      “那是你的裙子？你还穿裙子？”
      “我怎么就不穿裙子啊？冒傻气！”
    张维祥酸涩地笑笑。每年六个月的明水期巡逻执勤生活，既不能请假探家，妻子也不能来队，聚会都是在隆冬时节，他真想看一眼妻子穿裙服是个什么样子，妻子的体型可以说很不赖。聪明的孙丽娟忽然领悟到丈夫的心思，当即脱下棉装，套上一件裙子，在阴凉的屋子里走了一圈；又换了一件，又走了一圈；又换了一件，又走了一圈。突然地，她扑到丈夫怀里哭了。“转业吧，即使不考虑我也应当考虑咱们的儿子！”
    张维祥真的发狠了，想借着精简整编的时机结束军人的生涯。他有一副被乌苏里江的鲑鱼鲤鱼狗鱼滋养出来的好体格，他的脑子不但不笨甚至可以说很聪明，他的领导经历为他积累了管理和人际关系方面的丰富经验，你说干什么吧，干什么都不怕！可是，当他回到天似穹庐、地连旷野、充满一派浩浩大气的界河，一种神圣而宏大的东西便感染他、吸引他、鼓动他、压迫他，转业的念头竟像贼一样不敢露面。就这样，他年复一年地巡逻在界河上。
    这个在界河上度过将近二十个春秋的老兵同那块土地有着微妙、复杂的感情纠葛。他骂它
  “鬼地方”，诅咒它窃走了本来属于他的美好的东西。比方，他的眼皮原本很薄很美丽，因为江面阳光返照，不得不眯眯眼，结果眼皮厚搭搭的坠下来。他又眷恋它，袒护它，以至不愿听到别人揭露它的缺点。他用少女般的痴情向我讲述界河：
    界河的春天——为春天传报信息的是冰排。由远及近的嘎叭嘎叭的冰层爆裂声，仿佛来自地核。冰山涌来时，寒光闪烁天际，冰块四处飞溅，轰隆的巨响把大地震得怵怵发抖。这瞬间会骤起大兴奋，仿佛大自然把什么东西注入到大地体内。冰排消逝后，第一批早春植物很快迸出花朵，红的像少女的嘴唇，黄的像寒夜的星星。这时候，他和士兵们每天都把大把大把的花儿抱上船，插在各种各样的器皿里，小小的巡逻艇有如花窖。
    界河的夏天——许多个晚霞绚烂的黄昏，他们头戴用艾蒿扎成的防蚊帽，坐在轻轻飘摇的甲板上，观赏各种觅食的小动物。红如炭火的小狐狸像侦探一样追踪金花鼠；浮游在水洼里的小鱼一旦丧失警惕，就会被贼一样的乌鸦一口叼走；“缩脖老等”像人一样，在泥泞的水洼里啪嗒啪嗒的踩着，从草洼里搜出小青蛙、小鱼或草根什么的，或者慢条斯理地吞进去，或者觉得哪儿不对劲儿，又阴阳怪气地用长嘴把它们掷进水洼。附近有时会传来赫哲族少女甜润的歌声，为此他们时常争论：她个子是高是矮，长得漂亮不漂亮？争论通常是没有结果的，因为他们不能跑过去看个究竟。
    界河的秋天——当山上的枫叶由黄变红、桦树叶由绿变黄、秋针更加翠绿的时节，当地的农民会用欢悦的语调互相提醒：“五花山啦！五花山啦！”于是过不了几天，宽阔的江面会出现成百上千的渔船，夜晚渔火闪烁，几同水上城市。这个时候出航巡逻，士兵们会涌出一种自觉地把自身存在同美好事物联在一起的情思。在秋季那些个热热闹闹的日子里，战士们反而变得古板深沉，彼岸上每一点动静都逃不过他们的视觉和听觉，有时甚至企盼主航道上发生一点不大不小的争端，好让他们的拳拳之心有个表现的机会。
    他没讲界河的冬天，度过了美丽的秋天，船队就浩浩荡荡地开回内河“冬眠”。这时候大家会突然发现界河竟同恶魔一般把他们的身体折磨得一团糟，因此用最粗野的语言诅咒界河。可是过不了多久，大家就像思念情人一样思念界河，巴不得立即开江，像鸟儿一样飞往界河。
    在那个不眠的夜晚，张维祥向我讲了许多许多。他想告诉我这样的意思：毫无疑问，他和他的士兵们深深地爱着界河，而且因为界河只有1／2印在中国的版图上，他们的爱显得更特别更仔细。从入伍那天起，他们就呼吸界河的空气，吮吸界河的精华，沐浴在界河的景色之中。界河以它全部粗犷而严峻、原始而古朴的美姿、色彩、仪态万千的变化，赋予他们以灵性，锻造了他们的性格。事实上，界河已经溶入了他们的生命，他们离不开界河，界河也离不开他们。
    敬礼，界河上的老兵！
