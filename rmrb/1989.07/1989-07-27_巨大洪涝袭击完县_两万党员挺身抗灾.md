On the night of July 21st, a 31-hour-long torrential rainstorm struck Wanzhou County, a poverty-stricken county in Hebei Province. This was the most severe flood disaster the county had experienced since its establishment. Over 20,000 Communist Party members stood at the forefront of the disaster relief efforts.

By the next morning, all 25 townships in the county had been affected by the floods. Out of 400,000 mu of grain fields, 190,000 mu were completely destroyed, and over 10,000 mu were washed away. Among the 270,000 residents, 50,000 were trapped, 25 people died, and over 500 were seriously injured. On the morning of the 22nd, amidst the vast floodwaters, the county's Party and government officials urgently assembled. County Party Secretary Wang Chengqun and County Magistrate Yao Guozhen immediately formed a command center. All members of the "five major departments" who were resting at home were called to duty. Deputy County Magistrate Yang Xinjian, who had been hospitalized for over two months with a heart condition and was still receiving intravenous treatment, heard about the disaster and resolutely got out of bed to join the relief efforts. Party members from various departments did not flee home but instead headed towards the hardest-hit areas. At various levels, Party organizations, despite communication disruptions, mobilized Party members and cadres to form the backbone of the people.

On the 22nd, the township head of Beibao Township, Yao Wanfu, led over a hundred residents on a patrol and discovered that a section of the dyke connecting Baoding had a breach of five to six meters. The floodwaters and rain formed a massive current, making it impossible to stop the flow with sandbags or straw mats. In this critical moment, Yao Wanfu, disregarding his own life, jumped into the floodwaters. Following him, dozens of Communist Party members also dove into the flood, forming a human barrier to prevent the water from flooding Baoding City. In Zicheng Village, Ding Township, the Party branch secretary, Han Ruixing, had his house completely washed away, but he did not hesitate to jump into the floodwaters to organize the evacuation of the villagers, saving the elderly, the weak, and the sick. The deputy branch secretary, Wang Jufen, whose husband was half-paralyzed, was urged by her husband to organize the villagers to save people and property. Under the leadership and influence of the Communist Party members, a spirit of "unity and mutual aid" spread throughout the disaster-stricken areas.

Currently, all trapped residents in Wanzhou County have been relocated, and large quantities of relief supplies have been delivered to the county, which was once submerged in floodwaters. The County Party Committee has called on Communist Party members to continue playing a leading role in the subsequent disaster relief and reconstruction efforts.

    巨大洪涝袭击完县
    两万党员挺身抗灾
    本报保定7月27日电　7月21日夜，一场长达31个小时的暴雨，狂袭河北贫困县完县。这是该县建国以来遭受的最大涝灾。全县两万多共产党员冲在抗灾第一线。
    一夜下来，全县25个乡镇都遭受洪涝灾害。40万亩粮田中已有19万亩形成绝收，上万亩完全被毁；27万人中有5万被困，25人死亡，500多人重伤。22日上午，在汪洋之中，县委县政府机关干部紧急集合。县委书记王成群、县长姚国珍立即组成指挥部，“五大班子”在家休养的干部全部到位。副县长杨新建患心脏病，已住院两个多月，还在输液。听到灾情，他毅然从病床上爬起，赶到县委要求上阵。各机关的共产党员没有人往家里跑，而是分头往重灾区；各级党组织在通讯断绝的情况下，组织起党员和干部，形成群众的“主心骨”。
    22日北堡乡乡长姚万福带领百余群众巡逻时发现，连接保定的界河堤一处决口，已达五六米。洪水与暴雨形成巨流，填土、扔麻包已无法阻挡。危急中，姚万福置生命于不顾，跃入洪流；跟着他，几十名共产党员纷纷扑进洪流中，组成人墙，避免了水困保定城的灾难。亭乡子城村党支部书记韩瑞兴家几间房被全部冲塌，他来不及照顾，就扑到洪水中组织群众转移，救出老弱病残；副支书王菊芬的老伴半身不遂，老伴却要她组织群众救人救物。在共产党员的带领和影响下，“团结互助”在灾区形成风气。
    目前，完县被困群众已全部得到安置，曾经是一片汪洋的县城里已运到大批救灾物资。县委号召共产党员在下步的抢险救灾和重建家园中继续发挥先锋模范作用。
