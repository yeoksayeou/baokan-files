Egypt Agrees to Help Sudan End Civil War

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Khartoum on July 23, Egyptian President Mubarak stopped in Khartoum on his way to the African Union summit and held talks with Sudan's new Prime Minister Bashir. He expressed that he would, on the premise of not interfering in Sudan's internal affairs, do his best to help the Sudanese government end the 6-year-long civil war in southern Sudan.

	Since Bashir overthrew the previous Sudanese government in a bloodless coup on June 30, Mubarak is the first foreign head of state to visit Sudan.

	In 1983, the Sudan People's Liberation Army took up arms in southern Sudan against the government, demanding broad autonomy and economic and administrative reforms, leading to the outbreak of the civil war.

    埃及答应帮苏丹结束内战
    据新华社喀土穆7月23日电　埃及总统穆巴拉克今天在赴非洲统一组织首脑会议途中在喀土穆逗留，同苏丹新总理巴谢尔举行会谈，表示他将在不干涉苏丹内政的前提下，尽力帮助苏丹政府结束苏丹南部历时6年的内战。
    自巴谢尔在6月30日未流血政变中推翻苏丹前政府以来，穆巴拉克是第一位访问苏丹的外国元首。
    1983年，苏丹人民解放军在苏丹南部，拿起武器反对政府，要求广泛区域自治和经济与行政改革，内战随之而起。
