	Steel Production Reaches 29.2 Million Tons in the First Half of the Year
	Beijing, July 1 (Xinhua) — Reporter Liu Xieyang reports: In the first half of this year, Chinese steel workers overcame difficulties and worked hard to achieve good results. Preliminary statistics show that from January to June, 29.2 million tons of steel, 27.44 million tons of pig iron, 23.09 million tons of steel products, and 79.38 million tons of iron ore were produced. The production of various types of steel in short supply, such as thin plates, seamless steel pipes, strip steel, and light rails, has all increased to varying degrees.

	In the first two months of this year, steel production was 880,000 tons less than the same period last year. Under the care of the State Council and the support of relevant departments and local governments, steel workers worked hard. In March, production increased steadily, and in April, the average daily steel production reached 1.704 million tons, setting a historical high. In May and June, workers continued to produce, with May's average daily steel production reaching 1.675 million tons and June's reaching 1.65 million tons, both exceeding the national plan.
