    According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 2nd: A message from Brunei's Bandar Seri Begawan reports that Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the Cambodian resistance forces, told the leaders of ASEAN countries that he will insist on achieving a "dignified" peace in Cambodia based on a multi-party system.

    This message was announced by Sihanouk's son, Norodom Naradiphong, in Bandar Seri Begawan, the capital of Brunei, yesterday. Naradiphong flew there to hold talks with ASEAN officials. He said that in the future, Cambodia will not have any single faction playing a "leading role," nor will it have any special relationship with Vietnam.

    西哈努克坚持多党制的和平
    据新华社北京7月2日电　文莱斯里巴加湾港消息：柬埔寨抵抗力量领导人诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王告诉东盟国家领导人，他将坚持在柬埔寨实现以多党制为基础的“体面”和平。
    这一信息是西哈努克亲王的儿子那拉列于昨天在文莱首都斯里巴加湾港宣布的。那拉列飞往那里同东盟官员举行会谈。他说，未来的柬埔寨将不会有任何一派起“领导作用”，也不会与越南有特殊关系。
