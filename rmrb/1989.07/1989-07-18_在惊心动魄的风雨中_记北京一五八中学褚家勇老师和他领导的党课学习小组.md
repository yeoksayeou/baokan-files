In the midst of the tumultuous events of 1989, Beijing was a city in turmoil. Rumors spread like wildfire, and hearts were unsettled. The waves of student protests and hunger strikes from universities were sweeping through middle schools and even elementary schools in the city. In this complex struggle, where some young students might lose their way, a group of high school students from a regular middle school in Beijing stood firm and calm. At this critical moment, they once again submitted their applications to join the Party.

Four Unusual Applications

These are excerpts from the applications of several high school students from Class 2 of Beijing No. 158 Middle School who applied to join the Party during the turmoil in Beijing:

“In my opinion, the student demonstrations are easily manipulated and are untimely and impulsive. Those participating in the demonstrations can be divided into three categories: the first are those who delight in chaos, and it is from them that various rumors and incitements originate; the second are the majority of students who, seeing some corrupt practices, want the government to correct them immediately, often leading to good intentions but wrong actions; the third are the citizens who often look at issues from their narrow self-interests. Among them, there are often some social dregs.

Wang Ge, April 24, 1989”

“I do not agree with the demonstrations by the capital's universities. During the mourning activities for Comrade Hu Yaobang, when the national leaders were busy with funeral affairs, students made various demands and even threatened. This is really inappropriate. In the large-scale student movements, a few people took the opportunity to spread rumors, attack Party and state leaders by name, and even shouted slogans to overthrow the Communist Party of China. This shows that a few people took advantage of this opportunity to carry out a planned conspiracy to disrupt the country and sabotage stability and unity.

Deng Yajing, May 27, 1989”

“There is still a crisis of trust. Some students who previously requested to attend Party classes have wavered. However, it is worth noting that those who remain are even more resolute. I believe that, especially at this time, when some people doubt the Party and society is in turmoil, it is even more necessary to establish the Party in high schools. This is more practical than any supportive activities. In these days, some people have gone out to demonstrate, raise funds, and boycott classes. I think these actions cannot solve practical problems. Joining the Party's ranks and using one's actions to establish the Party's prestige is the most effective and practical approach.

Shi Qun, May 18, 1989”

“Currently, students from some universities across the country are demonstrating and petitioning on the streets. Students in Beijing have even gone on hunger strikes to petition. Their initial intention was to help the Party and government promote reforms. However, a few people are using young students to achieve goals that they cannot achieve through legitimate means. They want to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, which is absolutely not allowed.

Wang Jing, May 27, 1989”

Between April and May 1989, Beijing was in chaos. Rumors spread, and hearts were unsettled. The waves of student protests and hunger strikes from universities were sweeping through middle schools and even elementary schools in the city. In this complex struggle, where some young students might lose their way, a group of high school students from a regular middle school in Beijing stood firm and calm. At this critical moment, they once again submitted their applications to join the Party.

What Excellent Teachers and Students!

This Party class study group is led and organized by the school's young teacher and Communist Party member, Chu Jia-Yong. Excellent students come from excellent teachers. Here is an excerpt from a letter written by the school's principal, Wen Ze, to the leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council on June 24. From the letter, one can see that the stability of the school first requires the stability of the teachers, and the political quality of the teachers has a significant impact on young students.

“I am a non-Party intellectual and the principal of an ordinary middle school in Beijing. During the days from the student unrest to the riot, the ordinary Party members, ordinary teachers, and even ordinary middle school students around me educated me, making me firm in my belief in China's future.

“On May 18, under various pressures, I allowed some students to go out and demonstrate. Young teacher and Party member Chu Jia-Yong heard this and immediately came to ask me, 'Is this the decision of the branch?' I explained that this was a necessary measure to guide the students and stabilize the school. Before I finished speaking, he burst into tears and said, 'I would rather be expelled from the Party than support the students' actions!' Then, he cried and poured out his worries about the severe reality to the Party branch secretary and me, explaining his principled opposition to the student unrest. In fact, as early as the beginning of the student unrest, he had expressed his criticism of the student unrest from the perspective of completely wrong thinking methods in the school's national situation analysis meeting. After the counter-revolutionary riot occurred, he not only insisted on normal teaching but also actively did ideological work for the students. In the tensest days, he, despite being ill and coughing up blood, insisted on walking more than 10 miles every day to return to class. After class, he also talked to the students. He said, 'At this time, I cannot take leave!'

“Under his influence, the 12 members of the high school second-year Party class study group he organized had 11 who consistently and clearly opposed the unrest, and 4 students submitted their applications to join the Party during the peak of the unrest.

“There are many such moving examples in our school: for example, two of our teachers live in the centers of unrest at Renmin University and Beijing Normal University. They not only never spread the endless rumors from there in the school but also often refuted various rumors with what they had heard and seen, helping people see the true face of the organizers of the student movement. Another example is a class teacher from our school who lives in the northern suburbs. After the counter-revolutionary riot occurred, he insisted on full attendance every day, traveling more than 30 miles. From June 5 to 7, he conducted home visits for graduating students in the Xidan area, dispelling people's fear with his actions and doing ideological work for the graduating students and their parents. Therefore, when we started classes on the 8th, the attendance rate in his class reached 100%, playing a driving role in stabilizing the school.”

Educating the Next Generation is Hopeful

Chu Jia-Yong is 36 years old and a young intellectual educated by New China. When he graduated from junior high school, he happened to experience the "Cultural Revolution," personally experiencing the decade-long political turmoil that swept the nation. Having suffered from the

    在惊心动魄的风雨中
    ——记北京一五八中学褚家勇老师和他领导的党课学习小组

    四份不寻常的入党申请书
    这是北京158中学高二年级几名要求申请入党的同学在北京发生动乱期间写的入党申请书的摘录：
    “我认为大学生游行是容易被他人利用的不合时宜的盲动。参加游行的有三种人，一种是唯恐天下不乱的人，某些蛊惑人心的煽动性谣言便出自他们之口；另一种人是广大学生，他们看到一些腐败现象，便想让政府立竿见影地改正，他们往往是好心办错事；再一种人就是市民，他们往往从自己狭隘的利益出发看问题。他们中间往往掺杂着一些社会渣滓。
    王戈　1989年4月24日”
    “我不同意首都高校学生的游行行动，在悼念胡耀邦同志的活动中，在国家领导人处于繁忙的丧事活动中，大学生提出各种各样的要求，甚至予以要挟，实在是不应该。在学生的大规模运动中，有极少数人借机制造谣言，指名攻击党和国家领导人，甚至还有人喊出打倒中国共产党的口号。这表明极少数人利用了这一机会，进行着一次搞乱全国、破坏安定团结的有计划的阴谋。
  邓亚京　1989年5月27日”
    信任危机仍然存在，以前要求参加党课的部分同学已经有所动摇。而值得重视的是留下来的更加坚决了。我认为，特别是在今天，有人对党产生怀疑，社会动荡，更有必要在高中建党。这比搞任何声援活动更实际。这几天有人游行、募捐、罢课，我看这都不可能解决实际问题。加入到党的队伍中来，以自己的行动来树立党的威信，这才是最有效的，最实际的。
    时群　1989年5月18日”
    “目前，全国的一些高校学生上街游行请愿，北京的大学生甚至绝食请愿，他们的初衷是为了帮助党和政府推动改革。但是有少数人利用青年学生想要达到他们无法通过正当的手段而达到的目标，他们想要推翻中国共产党的领导，这是绝对不允许的。
              王静　1989年5月27日”
    1989年4、5月间，北京处于动乱之中，谣言四起，人心浮动，高校学生游行、绝食的浪潮正在冲击着北京市的一些中学、甚至小学。在斗争相当复杂、一些青年学生容易迷失方向的时刻，北京的一所普通中学的高二年级的党课学习小组的同学却表现得十分坚定、冷静，在这关键时刻，他们又一次向党组织提出了入党申请。
    多好的教师多好的同学啊
    这个党课学习小组是由该校青年教师、共产党员褚家勇领导组织的。优秀的学生来自优秀的教师。这里再摘录该校校长文喆同志6月24日给中共中央、国务院领导同志的一封信。从信中可以看到，学校稳定，首先要教师稳定，教师的政治素质对青年学生的影响极大。
    “我是一名非党知识分子，是北京一所普通中学的校长。在从学潮到暴乱的日子里，我周围的普通党员、普通教师乃至普通中学生教育了我，使我坚定了对中国未来的信心。
    “5月18日，迫于各种压力，我允许部分学生上街游行。青年教师、共产党员褚家勇刚一听说，就急匆匆地找到我问：‘这是不是支部的决定？’我解释说这是为了疏导学生、稳定学校而不得已采取的措施。没等我说完他就声泪俱下地说：‘我宁肯被开除党籍，也不赞成学生的行动！’接着，他边哭边向党支书和我倾诉了他对严峻的现实的忧虑，说明了他对学潮的原则的反对立场。其实，早在学潮初起时，他就曾在学校举行的国情分析会上，从思维方法完全错误这一角度，表示过他对学潮的批评意见。而在反革命暴乱发生之后，他不但坚持正常教学工作，而且主动做学生思想工作。在形势最紧张的日子里，他不顾自己得病咯血，坚持每天走10多里路来复课，课后又找学生谈心。他说：‘在这种时候，我不能请假！’
    “在他的影响下，他所组织的高二党课学习小组12名成员，有11名自始至终旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，有4名同学在动乱高潮中提出了入党申请。
    像褚家勇老师和他的学生这样感人的事例，我校还有不少：例如我校有两位老师分别住动乱的中心师大与人大，她们不但从来不在学校传播那里每天层出不穷的谣言，反而经常用自己耳闻目见的事实驳斥各种谣言，帮助人们认清学运组织者的真实面目。又如我校一位班主任家住北郊，在发生反革命暴乱后，他每天往返30多里坚持全勤，在6月5日—7日这几天里，他在西单一带进行毕业生家访，以行动驱散人们的恐惧心理，做毕业生及其家长的思想工作。所以当我们8日开始复课时，他所在的班出勤率即达100％，为稳定学校起到推动作用。”
    教育好下一代是有希望的
    褚家勇今年36岁，是新中国培养的青年知识分子。他初中毕业时，正赶上“文化大革命”，亲身经历了那场长达十年、波及全国的政治动乱。饱尝动乱之苦的他，再也不希望看到中国大地上发生动乱。1969年至1975年，他先后在黑龙江生产建设兵团和山西农村插队劳动，在实践中经受了锻炼和考验。1975年，他进入北京师范大学学习，系统地学习马克思主义的经典著作。他原在西城区教育局机关工作，但一直向往着投身火热的教学第一线。在他的一再要求下，他被分配到北京158中担任政治课教师。
    动乱刚开始，褚家勇感到肩负的担子分外重，在政治斗争的风浪中，怎样使党交给自己培育的幼苗免受病虫害袭击，这是他最最焦虑的问题。他坚持上好政治课，党课学习由平时的一周一次增加到一周两次。在交通阻塞的日子里，他不辞辛苦，进行家访、个别谈心，尽量争取把更多的同学引上正确的方向。
    5月17、18日，上街游行的人越来越多，党课小组的中学生看到许多记者、教授、机关干部都上街了，有点沉不住气了，他们向老师提出了疑问：“游行是错还是对？”褚家勇理直气壮地对同学说：“判断事情的是与非、对与错，不应以参加的人多少、头衔高低来定，而是要透过现象看实质，看它是不是符合真理。这场动乱危害我们党和国家，就要坚决反对。”
    在褚老师的引导下，党课小组的同学在动乱中不仅自己立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，而且积极去扩大影响，使更多的同学保持冷静的头脑，不上大街去声援。
