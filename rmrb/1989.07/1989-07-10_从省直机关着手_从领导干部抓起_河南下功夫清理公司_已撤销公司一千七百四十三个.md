Henan Province has taken decisive action to clean up and rectify companies, starting with provincial government agencies and focusing on leaders. This effort has yielded significant results.

So far, the province has revoked 1,743 companies that do not meet the necessary conditions. Among these, 745 companies were set up by party and government agencies, with 434 of them being revoked and the remaining 311 companies completely decoupled from the agencies. In 294 companies where government and enterprise functions were not clearly separated, 79 were revoked and the rest have returned their administrative functions to the government. Additionally, 162 companies that enjoyed special tax exemptions have had their preferential treatment canceled. Out of 1,724 party and government cadres, as well as retired cadres, who held concurrent positions in companies (enterprises), 98.6% have resigned from their company positions.

The provincial leading group for cleaning up and rectifying companies, based on a thorough investigation and verification of 274 companies under provincial agencies and 49 bureaus, held a press conference. They announced that 71 provincial government officials (including 37 at the provincial and bureau levels) have resigned from their concurrent positions. They also revoked and deregistered 38 provincial companies that did not comply with policies, did not serve a useful function, or engaged in serious illegal business activities. Furthermore, they publicly handled 7 companies with serious illegal activities. Meanwhile, Zhengzhou City has also revoked or suspended the operations of 17 companies.

To prevent the cleanup from being just a formality, Henan Province has also focused on spot checks and key rectifications during the company cleanup. For the cases of illegal activities that have been investigated, in addition to confiscating all illegal gains, appropriate actions have been taken against the individuals and relevant leaders involved. Currently, there are still 86 major economic illegal cases under investigation in the province.

Recently, the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies in Henan Province has entered the registration stage. To clarify the scope of the reform and deepen the cleanup work, Henan Province, in combination with its actual situation, has formulated 5 supporting documents, including "Notice on Cleaning Up Various Companies' Tax Exemptions," and "Company Cleanup and Rectification Acceptance Standards," to provide policy basis for ensuring a thorough cleanup and rectification of companies.

    河南下功夫清理公司
    已撤销公司一千七百四十三个
    本报郑州7月10日电　记者李杰报道：河南省清理整顿公司，从省直机关着手，从领导干部抓起，态度坚决，措施得力，抓出了成效。
    到目前为止，全省已撤销不具备条件的公司1743个，其中，在党政机关办的745个公司中，有434个被撤销，其余的311个公司也全部与机关脱钩；在294个政企不分的公司中，79个被撤销，其余已将行政职能还权于政；162个享受特批减免税的公司也全部取消了“优惠”待遇；在公司（企业）兼职、任职的1724名党政干部和退（离）休干部中，98.6％的人已辞去一头的职务。
    省清理整顿公司领导小组在对省直274个公司，抓紧摸底排队和对49个厅局调查核实的基础上，召开新闻发布会，宣布71名省直机关干部（其中省级和厅局级干部37人）辞去兼任的职务，撤销、注销38家不符合政策、不起服务作用和有严重违法经营行为的省直公司，并对7家有严重违法行为的公司进行了公开处理。与此同时，郑州市也吊销、停办了17家公司。
    为防止清查走过场，河南省在清理整顿公司中还认真抓好抽查和重点整顿，对查处的违法案件，除没收其全部非法所得外，对当事人和有关领导也作了适当处理。目前，全省还有86件重大经济违法案件正在查处之中。
    近日，河南省清理整顿公司工作已进入登记注册阶段。为明确改革界限、把清理整顿工作引向深入，河南省还结合本省实际，制定了“关于清理各类公司减免税收的通知”等5个配套文件和“清理整顿公司验收标准”，为保证清理整顿公司进行彻底提供政策依据。
