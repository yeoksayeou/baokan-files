Jiangxi Pioneers Old-Age Insurance for Households with Only Daughters

    The Jiangxi Provincial Insurance Company has pioneered a rural old-age insurance scheme for households with only daughters, effectively promoting the implementation of the family planning policy.

    This insurance scheme stipulates that rural families who have fewer children and only daughters, and whose parents have undergone sterilization, will have their county, township, and village governments jointly contribute (in some places, this also includes a portion of funds raised from the community) to pay the insurance premiums to the insurance company. Once the insured individuals reach the age of 55 or 60, both husband and wife can receive old-age insurance benefits equivalent to the local standard of living, as well as funeral expenses and bereavement allowances upon their death.

    The old-age insurance for households with only daughters was established in 1987 and has since been promoted in regions such as Ganzhou.

    江西首创纯女户养老保险
    本报讯　记者梅洪如报道：江西省保险公司在全国首创农村纯女户养老保险，有效地推动了计划生育政策的落实。
    这项险种规定，农村少生且只生女孩的父母，凡做了绝育手术的，便由县、乡、村财政共同出资（有的地方还包括向群众集资的一部分），向保险公司缴纳保险费，等被保险人年满55岁或60岁以后，夫、妇均可向保险公司领取相当于当地一般生活水平的养老保险金，以及故世后的丧葬费和抚恤金。
    纯女户养老保险是1987年创办的，现已在赣州等地区推广。
