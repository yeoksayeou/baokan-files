If you want to know the plains, choose the days after autumn. Do not take the bus, nor ride a bicycle. It is best to walk barefoot along the ridges like a pulse.

At this time, the plains have no concealment, every corner is exposed. The girl named Autumn hides behind the golden grain stacks in the courtyard, peeking out to make faces at you...

The warm wind licks your face, and you will recall the touch of your mother's hand when you were a child.

The kind red dragonflies fly around you, without any malice...

The old cow's mooing is very affectionate...

Groups of three or five people walk towards the direction of the smoke from the kitchen...

At this time, you will feel that the plains are as rich and deep as a father.

So, you want to do a few somersaults in the fields, you want to shout at the top of your lungs, or sing a song...

    你若想认识平原
    宛凝
    你若想认识平原，那就选择秋后的日子来。不要坐汽车，也不要骑自行车，最好是沿着脉搏般的田埂赤足走来。
    这时候的平原没有掩饰，每个角落都袒露无遗。那个叫秋儿的女孩儿，躲在场院上的金谷垛后面探头探脑向你扮鬼脸儿呢……
    暖融融的风，舔舐你的面庞，你会回味起儿时妈妈的抚摸。
    善良的红蜻蜓，绕着你飞来飞去，没有丝毫恶意……
    老牛的叫声很亲昵……
    三五成群的人儿朝着炊烟的方向走去……
    这时候你会觉得平原醇厚如父亲。
    于是，你想在田野上翻几个跟斗，你想扯开嗓子大喊几声，或唱个歌儿……
