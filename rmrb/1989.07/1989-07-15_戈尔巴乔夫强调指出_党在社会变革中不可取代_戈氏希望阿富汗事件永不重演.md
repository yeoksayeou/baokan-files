Gorbachev Emphasizes the Indispensable Role of the Party in Social Transformation

Gorbachev Hopes the Afghan Incident Will Never Repeat

Soviet leader Gorbachev emphasized that the party, as a political force uniting society, should be active in all areas of social life. The role of the party should not be weakened now; instead, it should become an indispensable factor in social revolutionary changes.

Gorbachev made these remarks yesterday at the plenary session of the Leningrad Oblast Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Tonight, Tass released his speech. The plenary session also saw the replacement of the first secretary of the Leningrad Oblast Committee.

In his speech, Gorbachev said that the party and the state are currently in a complex, perhaps the most complex, stage of history. He noted that conservatives are holding us back, using scare tactics like "chaos will ensue immediately" and "the state will collapse." Extremists and political adventurers, on the other hand, want to achieve their goals in one step. These people exploit existing problems and difficulties for personal gain, unwilling to engage in constructive work to alleviate tensions, correct mistakes, and advance reforms. He called on everyone to resolutely overcome egalitarianism and dependency, otherwise, "it will be impossible to carry out the expected genuine reforms."

When discussing the social and political tensions caused by market supply difficulties, particularly food shortages, Gorbachev said that the people understand that large-scale, profound reforms require time, effort, and resources. However, people cannot tolerate the failure to solve simple everyday problems. He stressed the need to resolutely address important personal issues such as food, goods, and housing, allowing people to quickly feel the results. To achieve this, it is necessary to fundamentally change the economic and production relations in industry and agriculture.

This Soviet leader also pointed out that in a tense social situation, there will inevitably be forces deliberately undermining the party's prestige. Unfortunately, these forces have not received the necessary counterattack. At the same time, Gorbachev emphasized that the party itself should quickly reform to adapt to the new situation in society.

Soviet leader Gorbachev said that every effort should be made to ensure that the Afghan incident related to the Soviet Union will never happen again.

He made this statement on the 14th during a meeting with the delegation to rescue Soviet prisoners of war in Afghanistan at the Kremlin.

This delegation recently visited Pakistan and will soon fly to Afghanistan to continue efforts to rescue prisoners of war.

Gorbachev said that the consequences of the Afghan war are severe: many people have been killed, some have been disabled, some have gone missing, and some have been captured.

He said that the Soviet Union's position is to rescue the captured young soldiers through various channels, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Arab countries, the United States, and the United Nations.

It is reported that more than 200 Soviet prisoners of war have not been released.

    戈尔巴乔夫强调指出
    党在社会变革中不可取代
    戈氏希望阿富汗事件永不重演
    新华社莫斯科7月13日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫强调指出，党作为团结社会的政治力量应该在社会生活的一切领域活动，党的作用现在不仅不能削弱，而且应成为社会革命变革中的不可取代的因素。
    戈尔巴乔夫是昨天在苏共列宁格勒州委全体会议上说这番话的，今晚塔斯社播发了他的讲话。在昨天举行的会议上更换了列宁格勒州委的第一书记。
    戈尔巴乔夫在讲话中说，党和国家正处在历史上复杂的，也许是最复杂的阶段。他说，保守分子在拖我们后腿，用“马上会发生混乱”和“国家要崩溃”来吓人；超极端分子和政治冒险分子则想一步就达到目的。这些人利用存在的问题和困难进行投机，不愿以建设性的工作来消除紧张、纠正错误和把改革向前推进。他号召大家坚决克服平均主义和依赖心理，否则“就不能进行预期的真正的改革”。
    在谈到由于市场供应困难，首先是食品短缺而造成的社会政治紧张时，戈尔巴乔夫说，人民非常理解，大规模的、深刻的改革需要时间、努力和资源，但人们不能容忍不解决日常生活中简单的问题。他强调，应该坚决解决食品、商品和住房等重要的切身问题，让人们迅速感觉到成果，为此必须根本改变工业和农业的经济关系和生产关系。
    这位苏联领导人还指出，在社会紧张的情况下，不可能不出现有意识破坏党的威信的势力，遗憾的是这些势力并没有得到应有的反击。与此同时，戈尔巴乔夫强调党自身应迅速进行改革，来适应社会上出现的新形势。
    新华社莫斯科7月14日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，要竭尽一切努力使同苏联有关的阿富汗事件永远不再重演。
    他14日在克里姆林宫会见拯救苏联在阿富汗战俘代表团时作了上述表示。
    这个代表团最近访问了巴基斯坦，日内将飞往阿富汗继续为拯救战俘进行努力。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，阿富汗战争的后果很严重：许多人牺牲，有人成了残疾，有人失踪，也有人被俘。
    他说，苏联的立场是通过巴基斯坦、阿富汗、阿拉伯国家、美国和联合国等各种渠道拯救被俘的青年战士。
    据悉，尚有200多名苏联被俘军人未获释。
