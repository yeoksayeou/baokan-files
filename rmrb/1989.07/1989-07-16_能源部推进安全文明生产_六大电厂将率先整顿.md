Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 16th

The Ministry of Energy's national power generation work conference concluded yesterday in Hohhot. According to information provided at the conference, from January to June this year, the broad masses of workers in China's power system overcame various difficulties and completed a total of 279.88 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, a 6% increase over the same period last year. During the turmoil in some places, the power generation and supply departments did not experience any major production accidents. However, some enterprises have lax labor discipline, and the "safety first" mindset has relaxed. There are many equipment defects in large thermal power units. Therefore, the Ministry of Energy has decided to focus on rectifying the Xiongyue, Yaomeng, Shentou, Datong, Jinzhou, and Qinling six major power plants. The goal is to first quickly make these power plants achieve stable and full power generation, and then strive towards the goal of "safe and civilized production to create a new level."

    能源部推进安全文明生产
    六大电厂将率先整顿
    新华社呼和浩特7月16日电　（记者翟振业）能源部召开的全国电力生产工作会议昨天在呼和浩特闭幕。根据会议提供的情况，今年1—6月份，我国电力系统广大职工克服种种困难，共完成发电量2798.8亿千瓦时，比去年同期增长6％。在一些地方发生动乱期间，发电、供电部门没有发生重大生产事故。但是，部分企业劳动纪律松弛，“安全第一”的思想有所松懈，火电大机组的设备缺陷很多。为此，能源部决定重点抓谏壁、姚孟、神头、大同、锦州、秦岭六大电厂的整顿工作，先要尽快使这些电厂达到稳发满发，然后再向“安全、文明生产创水平”的目标努力。
