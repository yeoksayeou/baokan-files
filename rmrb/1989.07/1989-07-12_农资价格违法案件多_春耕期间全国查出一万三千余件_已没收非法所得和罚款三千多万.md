According to materials provided by the State Price Bureau, the nationwide inspection of agricultural production material prices during the 1989 spring plowing season yielded good results. From March 1 to May 31, a total of 13,788 cases of price law violations were discovered nationwide, with illegal gains amounting to 86.84 million yuan.

Among these cases, 95% involved operating entities, while only 5% involved production entities. This indicates that illegal activities primarily occur in the circulation stage. Currently, 76% of the price law violation cases have been processed. The total amount of confiscated illegal gains and fines is 34.6575 million yuan, of which 23.794 million yuan has been remitted to the treasury, and 5.2145 million yuan has been returned to users.

In terms of the inspected items, the most prominent issue was the illegal pricing of fertilizers, with 7,725 cases, accounting for 56% of the total. This was followed by illegal pricing cases involving agricultural oil, agricultural film, pesticides, and seeds.

    春耕期间全国查出一万三千余件  已没收非法所得和罚款三千多万
    新华社北京7月12日电  据国家物价局提供的材料，1989年全国春耕期间开展的农用生产资料价格大检查收到了较好效果。从3月1日至5月31日，全国共查出价格违法案件13788件，非法所得8684万元。
    在上述案件中，经营单位的价格违法案件占总件数的95％，生产单位只占5％。这说明违法行为多发生在流通环节。目前，已对76％的价格违法案件作了处理，没收非法所得和罚款的总金额为3465.75万元，其中上缴财政2379.40万元，退还用户521.45万元。
