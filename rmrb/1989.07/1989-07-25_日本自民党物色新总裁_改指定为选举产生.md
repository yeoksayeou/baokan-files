Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 25th.

After Uno announced yesterday that he would resign from his posts as President of the Liberal Democratic Party and Prime Minister, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan has begun the process of selecting a new president.

According to reports, factions within the Liberal Democratic Party, including those led by Takeshita, Abe, former Nakasone, Miyazawa, and Kawamoto, have all started moving. Each faction is considering and nominating candidates for the new president based on their own interests, and they are also vying for the dominant role in mediation. The candidates being considered by various factions include Kinmochi Sakamoto, Ichiro Ozawa, Ryutaro Hashimoto, Toshio Kawamoto, Yoshio Sakurauchi, Michio Watanabe, Takeshi Fukuda, and Tadashi Ito.

This morning, the Liberal Democratic Party held consecutive meetings of its executive committee and general affairs committee. They decided to learn from the lessons of the previous instance where Takeshita designated his successor, and this time the new president will be elected. Due to time constraints, it is not possible to hold a vote among all party members, so it was decided to hold the vote among the Liberal Democratic Party's Diet members. For this purpose, it was decided to establish the Liberal Democratic Party President Election Management Committee, with Seiryu Onishi as the chairman.

It is estimated that the Liberal Democratic Party will not be able to elect a new president until mid-August.

    日本自民党物色新总裁
    改指定为选举产生
    新华社东京7月25日电　（记者王大军）在宇野昨天宣布将辞去自民党总裁和内阁首相职务后，日本自民党内又开始了物色新总裁的活动。
    据报道，自民党党内的竹下、安倍、旧中曾根、宫泽、河本等各派都已行动起来，纷纷从本派利益出发，酝酿和推举新总裁候选人，并争夺调停的主导权。各派欲推举的候选人有：金丸信、小泽一郎、桥本龙太郎、河本敏夫、樱内义雄、渡边美智雄、福田赳夫、伊东正义等。
    今天上午，自民党相继召开了干部会和总务会，决定吸取上次竹下指定继承人的教训，这次新总裁由选举产生。由于从时间上考虑，在全体党员中举行投票已不可能，决定在自民党国会议员中举行投票。为此，决定成立自民党总裁选举管理委员会，由奥野诚亮任委员长。
    据估计，自民党将到8月中旬以后才能推举出新总裁。
