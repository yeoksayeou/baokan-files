From educational investment to farmer training, from improving school conditions to enhancing the skills of returned educated youth, a series of specific and clear educational evaluation indicators have made various levels of leadership in Hunan Province realize that emphasizing education cannot just be a slogan but must be put into action.

In this year's pilot supervision, the Hunan Provincial Department of Education organized a team of experts to carefully formulate evaluation guidelines and methods, conducting strict supervision and inspection of local governments.

The economic development of Chen County is at the middle to lower level in the province, but the county's party and government leaders place great importance on education. The county "does not buy cars or build buildings, but is willing to spend money on education," raising more than 27 million yuan from various channels in recent years to develop the education cause. The county has built and renovated school buildings covering 270,000 square meters, with no dangerous buildings in any school. After the supervision and evaluation, the Provincial Department of Education decided to award Chen County 50,000 yuan in bonuses, with 20,000 yuan awarded to county and township leaders and school principals who have contributed to education, and 2,000 yuan each directly awarded to the county party secretary and county magistrate.

The initial implementation of educational supervision and evaluation has effectively promoted the integration of education and the economy in Hunan, prompting government departments and all sectors of society to pay attention to and support education. Liling City has rapid economic development, but insufficient investment in education, poor conditions in rural primary and secondary schools, and a large area of dangerous buildings. The supervision and evaluation results show that Liling City's education work lags behind its economic development, and it has been criticized by the Provincial Department of Education. Subsequently, the city immediately decided to address the dangerous buildings as a breakthrough, raising the awareness of the city's party and government leaders and all sectors of society about the strategic position of education. The municipal government allocated 1.62 million yuan as subsidies and rewards for renovating dangerous buildings and signed responsibility statements with various townships; the county people's congress resolved to start reviewing the financial expenditures of townships this year, ensuring that the proportion used for education is not less than 30%; the municipal committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference decided to expand the reward objects of their established education reward foundation to township party and government cadres.

To strengthen the authority of the educational supervision department, Hunan Province has decided to mainly base the supervision and evaluation conclusions to implement an educational veto on the performance of various levels of party and government leaders and government work.

At the same time, Hunan is also conducting a pilot supervision and evaluation of ordinary middle schools and, on this basis, has issued the provincial middle school education evaluation plan.

    督导检查政府部门  促进社会各界支教
    湖南推行教育督导评估
    本报长沙7月28日电　记者杜若原报道：从教育的投入到农民的培训，从办学条件的改善到回乡知青的提高，一系列具体、明晰的教育评估指标，使湖南省各级领导意识到重视教育不能喊在嘴上，而必须付诸行动。
    在今年的督导试点中，湖南省教委组织一批专家，认真制订了评估细则和评估方法，对地方政府进行严格的督导检查。
    郴县的经济发展状况位居全省中下水平，但这个县的党政领导十分重视教育。县里“不买小车不盖楼，舍得花钱办教育”，近年多渠道筹措2700多万元发展教育事业。全县新建和改建校舍面积27万平方米，所有学校无一级危房。经过督导评估，省教委决定发给郴县5万元奖金，其中2万元奖给办教育有功的县乡领导、学校校长，直接奖给县委书记、县长每人2000元。
    开始推行的教育督导评估，较好地促进了湖南教育和经济的结合，促使政府部门和全社会重视、支持教育。醴陵市经济发展快，但教育投入不足，农村中小学办学条件差，危房面积大。督导评估结果表明，醴陵市教育工作与经济发展差距很大，受到省教委的批评。此后，市里立即决定以解决危房为突破口，提高全市党政领导和全社会对教育战略地位的认识。市政府拿出162万元作为改造危房的补贴和奖励，并与各乡镇签订责任状；县人大决议从今年起审议乡镇财政开支情况，保证用于教育的比例不低于30％；市政协确定将他们筹建的教育奖励基金会的奖励对象，扩大到乡镇党政干部。
    为了强化教育督导部门的权威，湖南省已决定主要依据督导评估结论，对各级党政领导的业绩及政府工作实施教育一票否决。
    与此同时，湖南还进行普通中学督导评估的试点，在此基础上颁发了全省中学教育评价方案。
