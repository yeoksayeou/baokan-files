The first flood peak of the Dongliao River has safely entered Liaoning Province from Jilin Province, but the receding process is slow. The Beijing-Harbin, Changtu, and Pingqi railway lines, which were temporarily suspended due to flood damage, have resumed limited-speed operations.

With the efforts of railway workers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army working day and night, the Beijing-Harbin railway's middle and long sections, and the railway from Siping to Qiqihar have resumed full-line limited-speed operations at 6:55 AM and 5:52 AM today, respectively. The water-damaged section of the Changchun-Tumen railway has resumed limited-speed operations at 5 kilometers per hour.
