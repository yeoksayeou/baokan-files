Cucumbers generally grow best in warm environments. However, recently in the high-cold region of Vyatlagsky District in the Soviet Union, from sowing to the marketable cucumber, it only took 49 days. The person who created this miracle is a veteran Communist Party member from Fuyuan County, Heilongjiang Province, China—Jiang Kaichang.

In early 1989, Fuyuan County and Vyatlagsky District in the Soviet Union signed the first Sino-Soviet agricultural technology cooperation project. This project required an experienced vegetable cultivation agronomist. The leadership was worried about finding the right person. In 1987, the veteran Communist Party member Jiang Kaichang, who had retired to the second line, volunteered to take on the task.

On February 27, 1989, Jiang Kaichang bid farewell to his hometown and his ailing wife and came to a foreign land. The local area experiences drought for ten years out of nine, and the temperature in May and June often drops below zero. Cultivating vegetables here is more challenging than in China. Jiang Kaichang, who had won multiple provincial and municipal awards for vegetable cultivation research achievements, carefully investigated and analyzed the local climate, soil, and water sources. He proposed measures such as short seedling cultivation (transplanting 22 days after sowing), temperature control without water control (due to the dry soil in the Soviet Union), and strict temperature adjustment to ensure the normal growth of cucumbers. In three months, Jiang Kaichang slept less than 4 hours a day and lost 8.5 kilograms!

On May 9, 1989, during the nationwide celebration of the victory over fascism in the Soviet Union, the Vyatlagsky District of the Far Eastern city of Khabarovsk Region in the Soviet Union, for the first time in history, had fresh cucumbers on the market in May. The Soviet newspaper *Pacific Star* was the first to report this news. Reporters from the Soviet *Labor Newspaper*, *Far Eastern Newspaper*, and *Moscow Newspaper* flocked to the scene. If they had not seen it with their own eyes and tasted it with their own mouths, they would not have believed it was true.

    中国黄瓜大师在苏联
    陈林
    黄瓜，一般在温暖环境下才能生长。而最近在苏联高寒地区维亚捷姆斯基区，从播种到商品瓜上市，只用了49天，创造这一奇迹的，是我国黑龙江抚远县一位老共产党员——姜开昌。
    今年初，抚远县和苏联维亚捷姆斯基区签定了第一个中苏农业技术合作项目。这个项目需要一名有丰富实践经验的蔬菜栽培农艺师。领导正在为物色这一人物发愁。1987年退居二线的老共产党员姜开昌自告奋勇报了名。
    1989年2月27日，姜开昌离别了故乡和多病的老伴，来到了异国他乡。当地十年九旱，五六月里气温还常降至零度以下。在这里搞蔬菜栽培，比国内有更多的困难，曾经获得省市级蔬菜栽培科研成果多项奖励的姜开昌，仔细考察分析了当地的气候、土质和水源，拟定了短苗龄育植（即播种22天就移植）、控温不控水（因苏土壤干旱）、严格调整温度等措施，确保了黄瓜的正常生长。在3个月里，姜开昌每天睡眠不足4小时，体重掉了8.5公斤！
    1989年5月9日，在苏联举国上下庆祝反法西斯斗争胜利的节日里，苏联远东城市哈巴罗夫斯克边区维亚捷姆斯基区，有史以来第一次在5月吃到了上市的鲜嫩黄瓜。苏联《太平洋星球日报》第一家发布了这条新闻。苏联《劳动报》、《远东日报》、《莫斯科日报》的记者接踵而至，要不是亲眼看到、亲口吃到，他们怎么也不会相信这是真的……
