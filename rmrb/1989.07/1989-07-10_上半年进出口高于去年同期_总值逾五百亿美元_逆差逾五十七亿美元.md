	China's First-Half Imports and Exports Exceed Last Year's Figures
	Total Value Surpasses $500 Billion, Deficit Exceeds $57 Billion

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10 - (Reporter Lí Lúbō) According to the latest statistics from the General Administration of Customs, China's total import and export value for the first half of the year reached $503 billion, with a deficit of $57.85 billion, significantly higher than the same period last year.

	The total import and export value for the first half of the year increased by 16.8% compared to the same period last year. Exports rose by 6.5%, reaching $222.58 billion, while imports increased by 26.7%, reaching $284.43 billion.

	In the various indicators reported by the customs, although most imports and exports are relatively balanced, in the general trade using foreign exchange, imports increased by 24.9% while exports decreased by 8.5%, resulting in a trade surplus of over $3.5 billion.

	Analysts here believe that the imbalance in imports and exports, which is causing the deficit, is becoming increasingly pronounced. The annual deficit may exceed $100 billion, reaching the levels of 1985 or 1987.

	From January to June, there were 13 types of commodities with export values exceeding $2 billion. Apart from aquatic products, canned goods, medicines, cotton cloth, polyester-cotton fabric, real silk, and garments, the export of six types of products, including grain, cotton, coal, crude oil, refined oil, and cotton yarn, all saw varying degrees of decline. In the same period, there were 11 types of commodities with import values exceeding $2 billion. Apart from logs and wool, the imports of grain, sugar, pulp, synthetic fibers for textiles, refined oil, compound fertilizers, paper and paperboard, steel, metal processing machinery, television picture tubes, and automobiles and automobile chassis all saw significant increases.

    上半年进出口高于去年同期
    总值逾五百亿美元　逆差逾五十七亿美元
    新华社北京7月10日电  （记者黎鲁波）据海关总署的最新统计，上半年中国的进出口总值已达503亿美元，逆差也高居57.85亿美元，大大高于去年上半年的水平。
    上半年进出口总值比去年同期增长16.8％，出口增6.5％，达到222.58亿美元；进口则上升26.7％，达到284.43亿美元。
    在海关统计的各种指标中，虽然大部分进出口相对均衡，但在使用现汇的一般贸易中，进口增加24.9％而出口却减少8.5％，两者相抵入超达35亿多美元。
    此间分析家认为，导致逆差的进出口不平衡正在日益扩大，全年的逆差有可能突破百亿大关，达到1985年或1987年的水平。
    1至6月出口金额超过2亿美元的商品有13种，除水海产品、罐头、医药品、棉布、涤棉布、真丝绸缎和服装外，粮食、棉花、煤、原油、成品油和棉纱等六种产品的出口都有不同程度的减少。而在同期进口金额超过2亿美元的商品中，除原木和羊毛外，粮食、食糖、纸浆、纺织用合成纤维、成品油、制成肥料、纸及纸板、钢材、金属加工机床、电视显像管和汽车及汽车底盘等11类产品的进口，均有较大幅度增加。
