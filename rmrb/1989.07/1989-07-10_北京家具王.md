The furniture king of Beijing

By Zhang Shuzheng, reporter for this newspaper

Just before the completion of the Beijing Western Central Color TV Center, the logistics staff of China Central Television frequently visited several well-known furniture factories in Beijing. After "comparing three options," the complete set of furniture from the Luzhou Timber Factory was selected! These pieces of furniture are stylish and unique, with a lacquer finish that is truly a masterpiece. Each piece of furniture is like a work of art, with a surface that is smooth as water, shiny as a mirror, clean as jade, and beautiful as a painting.

The Luzhou Timber Factory has gained fame, and so has its factory director, Sun Xu. Hundreds of furniture factories in Beijing have taken notice of this director from a township enterprise.

Joint Venture with Hong Kong Furniture Merchant

In a room at the Beijing Hotel, on one day in late 1987, Hong Kong merchant Wang Naiqing stopped pacing and picked up the telephone.

"Hello! Is this Director Sun Xu of the Luzhou Timber Factory?"

"I have decided to enter into a joint venture negotiation with you. Please come tomorrow."

Wang Naiqing is the owner of Hong Kong's Qinfahang Furniture. His products are distributed in Hong Kong, Macau, Kowloon, the United States, and many other countries. He has business dealings with furniture merchants from many countries around the world. The policy of reform and opening up on the mainland attracted him, and he was eager to find a furniture enterprise to jointly establish a factory. He had several interactions with Sun Xu and found that Sun Xu had many advantages: he was skilled in design, production, and management; he was ambitious and did not want to just maintain the status quo; he had a team of ten talented advisors and executives; the enterprise had good economic benefits and development potential; the factory was located in Fan Zhuang Village North, Tong County, Beijing, with convenient transportation, not far from Beijing Station, the Capital Airport, and Tianjin New Port.

After two years of careful consideration, Wang Naiqing chose Sun Xu as his joint venture partner.

From the start of negotiations to the completion of the joint venture procedures, it took only two months. In May 1988, a new sign was hung at the entrance of the Luzhou Timber Factory: "Beijing High-End Furniture Co., Ltd." Sun Xu served as the chairman and general manager of the company, while Wang Naiqing served as the vice chairman and vice general manager.

Advancing Product Grades Through Technological Progress

Sun and Wang adopted a joint venture in the form of a shareholding system, with investment ratios of 70% and 30% respectively. The projects were divided into three phases. The first phase involved updating equipment, renovating the factory, and producing mid-to-high-end mattresses, sofas, and various types of wooden furniture, achieving an annual production capacity of 10 million yuan. The second phase involved jointly establishing a foam product factory to produce foam products and furniture such as sofas and mattresses made from foam. The third phase involved using the world's most advanced "plastic coating" technology to produce spring corner hinges, plastic hidden latches, surface decorations, and other small hardware for furniture; and to produce bedding decorations such as spring and autumn quilts.

Now, the first phase of the project has been completed and production has begun. The entire company is in high spirits, and the production situation is promising.

Sun Xu excitedly announced at a staff meeting: "We have upgraded our equipment!" He happily showed the reporter the imported equipment, the high-efficiency assembly line, and the new furniture products with advanced technology.

The high-speed particleboard machine, automatic spring machine, automatic needle machine, and other main and auxiliary equipment are all imported from the United States, Switzerland, and Italy, and are at the world's advanced level. The products have begun to enter the international market.

From "Carpenter" to "Furniture King"

Sun Xu is of average height and appears sharp and capable. He is a middle-aged man who grew up with the Republic. From a village boy to a furniture entrepreneur, he has his own joys and strategies.

At the age of 17, Sun Xu apprenticed with a carpenter from his village. By the age of 23, he could lead a team to make furniture. When the township established the Luzhou Timber Factory, he was selected as the business manager and performed excellently. Soon, the factory incurred losses and was on the verge of bankruptcy. At the age of 34, Sun Xu was appointed as the factory director to save the factory. He did not disappoint the expectations, turning the factory around in just seven months.

Until the joint venture with the Hong Kong merchant six years ago, Sun Xu led the employees from producing ordinary wooden furniture to producing upholstered wooden furniture, from producing civilian furniture to producing mid-to-high-end hotel room furniture, from producing "custom orders" to producing "market furniture." The enterprise's development went through three milestones, and the business and reputation grew larger. More than 200 types of products are sold in Beijing, Northeast, South China, and Northwest regions. In 1988, the factory paid 2.7 million yuan in taxes and profits, and this year it is expected to reach 5 million yuan.

From "carpenter" to "furniture king," Sun Xu has left a shining footprint. We wish Sun Xu's furniture business even greater success!

    北京家具王
    本报记者　张书政
    京西中央彩电中心大楼告竣前夕，中央电视台后勤人员在北京几个有名的家具厂频频出入，经过“货比三家”，潞州木材厂的整套家具被选中了！这些家具，款式大方、别致，“擦漆”工艺堪称绝活，件件家具犹如工艺品，其外观柔如水，光如镜，洁如玉，美如画。
    潞州木材厂出了名，该厂厂长孙旭出了名。全北京几百家家具厂对这位乡镇企业的厂长刮目相看了。
    与香港家具商合资
    北京饭店一个房间里。1987年底的一天，港商王乃清停止踱步，拿起电话话筒。
    “喂！您是潞州木材厂厂长孙旭吗？”
    “我决定和您进行合资谈判，请您明天就来。”
    王乃清，香港勤发行家具商。其产品或转手家具行销香港、澳门、九龙、美国等地，他与世界上不少国家的家具商有业务往来。大陆改革开放的政策吸引了他，他有心找家家具企业合资办厂。他和孙旭有过几次接触，发现孙旭优点颇多，设计、制作、经营管理皆通；有抱负，不愿守摊吃饭；手下有称为“十大金刚”的智囊和干才；企业经济效益好，有发展潜力；厂址位于北京市通县城北范庄村南，交通便利，距北京站、首都机场、天津新港都不远。
    两年的深思熟虑，王乃清选定了孙旭这个合资对象。
    从谈判到办完合资手续，只用两个月。1988年5月，潞州木材厂大门口，挂出一块崭新的厂牌——“北京高级家具有限公司”。孙旭任公司董事长兼总经理，王乃清任副董事长、副总经理。
    靠技术进步上产品等级
    孙、王以股份制形式搞合资，投资比例分别占70％和30％，上的项目分三期进行。第一期是更新设备，改造厂房，投产中、高档席梦思床垫、沙发和各式木器家具，形成1000万元的年生产能力。第二期，合办海绵制品厂，生产海绵制品和以海绵为原料的沙发、床垫等家具。第三期，采用世界上最先进的“镀塑”工艺，生产弹簧门角、塑料暗锁、表面装饰等家具小五金；再配套生产春秋被等床上装饰品。
    现在，一期项目告竣，开机投产。全公司群情振奋，生产气象喜人。
    孙旭在职工大会上激动地宣布：“我们已经鸟枪换炮了！”他高兴地带着记者看进口设备，看高效率的流水生产线，看工艺先进的新家具产品。
    飞转着的高速刨花机，自动弹簧机、自动穿胆机等主要设备和辅助设备，都是从美国、瑞士、意大利引进的，具有世界先进水平。产品开始跻身于国际市场。
    从“小木匠”到“家具王”
    孙旭个子不高，看上去精明强干。他是个与共和国同龄的中年人。他从一个农村孩子成长为家具企业家，自有他的甘苦和韬略。
    孙旭17岁跟同村袁木匠学徒，23岁能够带班打家具。乡里办起潞州木材厂，选他作业务员，干得很出色。不久，该厂亏损，濒临倒闭，34岁的孙旭受命出任厂长，挽救该厂。他不负众望，7个月扭亏为盈。
    直到与港商合资前的6年间，孙旭带领职工从生产普通木器到生产软包木器，从生产民用家具到生产中、高档饭店客房家具，从生产“定货”到上“市场家具”，企业发展经历三个里程牌，家业和名气越来越大。200多种产品行销北京、东北、华南、西北等地区。1988年上缴利税270万元，今年可望达到500万元。
    从“小木匠”到“家具王”，留下了孙旭闪光的足迹。祝福孙旭的家具事业取得更大的成功！
