While the eastern coastal regions are vigorously developing export-oriented economies by establishing economic special zones, China's western regions are also actively leveraging their own advantages to open up a new pathway to the outside world.

This new pathway to opening up, known as the "Western Corridor," involves the western regions utilizing their relations with the Muslim regions of the northwest to develop economic and cultural cooperation with the Arab countries of the Middle East and the broader Islamic world. It also involves actively promoting border trade in the western regions to develop economic and technological exchanges with the Soviet Union and other countries in Eastern and Western Europe.

During a visit to some provinces in the western regions, reporters learned that in recent years, economic and cultural relations between the northwestern regions and the Arab countries of the Middle East have progressed from mutual visits and understanding to a new stage of cooperation. Border trade between the western border provinces and neighboring countries has also grown rapidly year by year. The previous "mutual visit boom" between officials and religious leaders in the northwestern regions and the Middle East has now expanded to include economic, financial, commercial, and civilian sectors. Products and services from the northwest have entered the Middle Eastern market and gained a good reputation, while Middle Eastern "petrodollars" have begun to invest in China. In the border ports of the western regions, local foreign trade is also thriving. According to the State Statistics Bureau, China's border trade with neighboring countries such as the Soviet Union, Mongolia, and Pakistan reached $653 million in 1988, an increase of 1.37 times compared to 1987. This trend has continued to grow in the first five months of this year. These signs indicate that China's western "Silk Road," which has been dormant for centuries, is quietly reviving.

Some economic experts believe that China's western regions are rich in resources and have great potential for development. Agriculture and animal husbandry are relatively developed, and various industrial sectors have taken shape, particularly halal food and light industrial products that are highly regarded in the Middle East and the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. As early as over 2,000 years ago, the "Silk Road" connected the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, establishing a historical tradition of opening up to the outside world. Therefore, the opening of this corridor in the western regions today and the restoration of the "Silk Road" are historical necessities. Its opening has brought new vitality to the development of this region.

Currently, the western regions, with their various advantages, are increasingly attracting the attention of foreign investors. Preliminary statistics show that the five provinces and autonomous regions in the northwest have already established over 120 joint ventures and utilized nearly $400 million in foreign investment. In 1988, the export earnings of these five provinces and regions reached over $900 million.

Border trade in the western regions is also developing rapidly. In the famous border ports of Horgos and Torgut in Xinjiang on the Sino-Soviet border, trucks transporting goods between the two countries are constantly on the move. The main exports to the Soviet Union are agricultural and sideline products and light textiles, while the imports from the Soviet Union are heavy industrial products such as steel, timber, cement, and fertilizers that are urgently needed for western construction. It is reported that Xinjiang's local trade with the Soviet Union in 1988 amounted to 180 million Swiss francs, nearly six times the amount in 1987. This year's growth trend remains unabated. Inner Mongolia's border trade with the Soviet Union also reached over 130 million Swiss francs in 1988, an increase of 82.7% over the previous year. Its border trade with Mongolia also reached 14.05 million Swiss francs, an increase of 2.5 times over the previous year.

A noteworthy trend is that western border local trade has extended to various forms and regions, including engineering contracting, joint ventures, processing with supplied materials, labor cooperation, and technological exchanges. Xinjiang has already carried out more than 10 scientific and technological cooperation projects with the Central Asian region of the Soviet Union, covering mineral, oil and natural gas development, earthquake research, energy utilization, and other fields. Recently, the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic alone has proposed 51 scientific and technological cooperation projects to Xinjiang. These cooperations are also extending through the border to the interior of China and the Soviet Union. Provinces such as Shaanxi, Ningxia, Gansu, Sichuan, Henan, and Liaoning in China have also joined the ranks of local trade with the Soviet Union and other countries through border provinces.

The state actively supports the opening up of the western regions and has provided many preferential policies. The western regions are also full of confidence, actively improving the investment environment, and seeking greater development. Some provinces in the northwest are actively building a number of railways and airports, purchasing aircraft to improve transportation. Among them, the construction of the Northern Xinjiang Railway is progressing smoothly and is expected to connect with the Soviet Union next year, becoming a "land bridge" connecting the two continents of Europe and Asia. At the same time, some provinces in the west are also building a number of industrial and agricultural export product bases suitable for the Middle East and Eastern Europe, and are linking with some inland provinces to expand the economic influence of opening up to the west.

### 一条对外开放新途径  我国开辟“西部通道”  西北地区与中东加强合作西部边境贸易成倍增长

    一条对外开放新途径
    我国开辟“西部通道”
    西北地区与中东加强合作西部边境贸易成倍增长
    据新华社银川7月10日电　（记者吴国清）在东部沿海地区兴建经济特区大力发展外向型经济的同时，我国西部地区也积极从自身的优势出发，正在开辟另一条对外开放的通道。
    这条被称为“西部通道”的对外开放新途径，是指西部地区利用西北穆斯林地区的关系，发展同中东阿拉伯国家、乃至伊斯兰世界的经济文化合作关系；大力开展西部边境贸易，发展同苏联等国，乃至东、西欧国家的经济技术交流。
    记者在西部一些省区采访中了解到，近年来，西北地区与中东阿拉伯国家间的经济文化关系，已由相互间的考察了解进入携手合作新阶段；西部边境诸省区与邻国的边境贸易逐年成倍地迅速增长。西北地区与中东阿拉伯国家间前几年的那种官方和宗教界的“互访热”，现在已发展到经济、金融、工商和民间各界；西北的商品、劳务进入了中东市场，并赢得信誉，同时，中东的“石油美元”开始向我国投资。而在西部边境诸口岸，地方对外贸易也呈现出一派繁荣景象。据国家统计局透露，去年中国同苏联、蒙古、巴基斯坦等邻国的边境贸易额达6.53亿美元，比1987年增长1.37倍。今年前5个月均又有更大的发展。这种种迹象表明，我国西部沉寂了不少世纪的“丝绸之路”，正在悄然复苏。
    对此，一些经济研究专家认为，我国西部地区地大物博，资源丰富，是块富有魅力的待开发宝地；这里农牧业较为发达，各工业门类初具规模，尤其是清真食品和轻工产品为中东和苏联及东欧所瞩目；早在2000多年前，就曾有“丝绸之路”沟通欧、亚、非大陆，有对外开放的历史传统。所以，今天西部地区开辟这条通道，重修“丝绸之路”，是历史的必然。它的开辟，为这一地区的开发带来了新的活力。
    目前，西部地区以其种种优势而越来越引起外商的瞩目。据初步统计，目前仅西北五省区就已办起“三资企业”120多家，利用外资近4亿美元；去年这五省区的出口创汇额已达9亿多美元。
    西部地区的边境贸易也发展迅速。在新疆境内中苏边境著名的霍尔果斯和吐尔戈特两个口岸，来往于两国运输货物的汽车络绎不绝。运往苏联的主要是农副产品和轻纺产品，而从苏联换回的则是西部建设急需的钢材、木材、水泥、化肥等重化工产品。据介绍，新疆1988年对苏地方贸易进出口成交额达1.8亿瑞士法郎，比1987年增长近6倍。今年的增长势头仍不减。内蒙古去年对苏边境贸易额也达1.3亿多瑞士法郎，比上年增长82.7％。其对蒙古的边境贸易额去年也达1405万瑞士法郎，比上年增长2.5倍。
    值得重视的迹象是，西部边境地方贸易已向工程承包、合资经营、来料加工、劳务合作、科技交流等多方面、多形式、多区域延伸发展。新疆与苏联中亚地区已开展了10多项科技合作，内容涉及矿产、石油天然气开发、地震研究、能源利用等。最近，仅苏联哈萨克斯坦共和国便一次向新疆提出了51项科技合作建议。这些合作也正在透过边境向中苏内地延伸。我国陕西、宁夏、甘肃、四川、河南、辽宁等省区都通过边境省区加入了对苏联等国的地方贸易行列。
    国家积极支持西部地区对外开放，并给予了许多优惠政策。西部地区也信心十足，在积极改善投资环境，谋求更大发展。西北一些省区正在积极建设一批铁路、机场，购置飞机，以改善交通。其中，北疆铁路的修建进展顺利，预期将在明年与苏联接轨，将成为沟通欧、亚两大洲的“大陆桥”。同时，西部一些省区还在兴建一批对中东和东欧适销的工农业出口商品基地，并联系内地一些省份扩大向西开放的经济势力。
