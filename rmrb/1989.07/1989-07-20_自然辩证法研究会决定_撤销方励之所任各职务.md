Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 20th. The Chinese Natural Dialectics Research Association recently, in accordance with the democratic procedures stipulated in its charter, decided to remove Fang Lizhi from his positions as vice-president, executive vice-president, and council member.

In light of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau's decision on June 10, 1989, to issue a warrant for Fang Lizhi on charges of "counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement," and based on the suggestions made by some of the standing committee members of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology who are in Beijing, the Chinese Natural Dialectics Research Association held its third session of the second council meeting on June 27.

The meeting decided, in accordance with the charter, to use the method of a postal ballot by all council members to remove Fang Lizhi from his positions as vice-president, executive vice-president, standing council member, and council member. The result of the postal ballot passed this decision.
