People's Daily, Beijing, July 24th - Correspondent Wen Zijiang reports: The second day of the Asian Amateur Boxing Championships saw intense competition. Chinese, North Korean, and Mongolian athletes all advanced to the next round.

In the evening, in the 60-kilogram class first round, 20-year-old Yang Xiaqiang from the People's Armed Police fought tenaciously for three rounds and defeated Thailand's Duta Sae. Yang Xiaqiang fought bravely and intelligently tonight. In the first round, neither fighter showed their full strength. In the second round, they engaged in a fierce exchange, and Yang Xiaqiang gradually gained the upper hand amidst the cheers of the crowd.

The other two Chinese athletes who competed today both suffered defeats. Xu Huilong, in the 48-kilogram class, although fierce, was technically inferior and lost to India's Yadav. In the 71-kilogram class, Chen Limin was knocked down in the first round of his match against South Korea's Liu Zhanghui and was unable to recover after the referee's count, resulting in a loss.

North Korean athlete Kim De Nam showed medal-winning potential today. After defeating an Iraqi opponent yesterday, he fought fiercely today and defeated the Philippines' Serantes. This match was one of the most intense and exciting of the day, with both fighters throwing punches like a storm, often landing simultaneous jabs to each other's faces. In the end, Kim De Nam's wave-like combination punches overwhelmed his opponent.

Mongolian athletes began to show their strength today, with three out of four competitors winning and securing their place as strong contenders for medals.

Four weight classes of preliminary matches were held tonight at the Capital Gymnasium, and the preliminaries will continue tomorrow.

    亚洲拳击锦标赛第二天争夺激烈
    中国、朝鲜、蒙古等选手分别进入下一轮
    本报北京7月24日讯　记者温子建报道：亚洲业余拳击锦标赛进行到第二天，中国选手终于取得了第一场胜利，在今晚进行的60公斤级第一轮比赛中，来自武警部队20岁的杨晓强经过三个回合的顽强拚搏，战胜泰国选手多塔飒。
    杨晓强今晚打得勇猛而机敏。第一回合两人均未施展出全部本领，第二回合他们展开对攻，杨晓强在观众的呼喊声中逐渐占了上风。
    今天出场的另外两名中国选手均遭败绩。48公斤级徐惠龙虽然勇猛，技术却稍逊一筹，他负于印度的亚达夫。71公斤级阚利民在同南朝鲜的柳彰铉比赛中，第一回合被击倒，裁判计数后未能恢复常态，因此被判负。
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国选手金德男今天表现了夺牌实力，他在昨天战胜伊拉克选手后，今天又在激烈的对攻中打败了菲律宾的赛兰蒂斯。这场比赛可以说是今昨最激烈而精彩的一番拚斗，两人出拳如急风暴雨，经常互以直拳同时击中对方面部。龙争虎斗之中，金德男终于以波浪般的组合拳进攻压倒了对手。
    蒙古选手今天开始显示了实力，出场的四名选手中有三人获得了胜利，他们将肯定成为奖牌的有力争夺者。
    今晚在首都体育馆共进行了四个级别的预赛，明天将继续进行预赛。
