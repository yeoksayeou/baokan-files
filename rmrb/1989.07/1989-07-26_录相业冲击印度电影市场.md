The video industry is shaking up the Indian film market. India is known as the film kingdom of the East, with over 800 new films released each year. However, in recent years, with the quiet rise of the video industry, this film kingdom is facing a severe challenge.

In the past, Indian film stars were always busy, but now they have to find films to shoot. Some big stars, unable to find work, have to go abroad on vacation. In the first quarter of this year, out of 39 Hindi films released, only 4 managed to break even. Dozens of other films had to stop distribution, and some films in production were forced to halt. The cause of this series of disastrous blows is the rapid spread of VCRs.

VCRs entered the Indian market six years ago. At that time, film producers did not realize that this seemingly insignificant industry would later become their main competitor. In just a few years, the video industry has developed rapidly, and VCRs have become a necessity for middle-income families. In more affluent regions, VCRs are quite common. Currently, there are approximately 100,000 stores nationwide that sell VCRs and video tapes, and video rental points are scattered throughout India, causing movie theater attendance to plummet sharply. These rental points operate for more than a dozen hours a day, showing the latest released films on video. Operators continuously convert newly released films into video tapes for public sale or rental to VCR owners. Some films, after being released for less than a week, already appear on store shelves. Most of these video tapes are illegally recorded, seriously infringing on film copyrights. However, relevant government departments seem to turn a blind eye to this, allowing it to develop unchecked. Even a few hours after a new film is released, it is already being sold on the black market as a video tape.

The rapid spread of VCRs has made the once-thriving film industry a thing of the past. The long lines in front of movie theaters are gone, and it is now quiet and deserted. Only a few films can barely maintain continuous screenings for two weeks. Last year, approximately 12,000 movie theaters nationwide closed due to low attendance and could not maintain normal operations.

Recently, some prominent figures in the Indian film industry have established the "Anti-Piracy Action Committee" to try to change the current passive situation of the film industry.

Indian Film Association Chairman Anand recently called for measures to strengthen legal protection of film copyrights, urging producers to reduce film costs, lower the salaries of big stars, and find new ways in film production to enhance competitiveness and regain the audience.

    录相业冲击印度电影市场
    印度堪称东方电影王国，以往每年上映800多部新影片。但是，近年来随着录相业的悄然兴起，这个电影王国正面临严峻挑战。
    往年，印度的电影明星们应接不暇，而今却反要找片子拍。一些大明星苦于无片可拍，只好到国外度假。今年第一季度上映的39部印地语影片中，只有4部刚刚不亏本。另有数十部影片不得不停止发行，一些拍摄中的影片也被迫停机。造成这一系列灾难性打击的原因是录相机的迅速普及。
    录相机于6年前开始进入印度市场。那时，电影制片商们并未意识到这不起眼的行业后来竟成为他们的主要竞争对手。短短的几年，录相业迅速发展，录相机成为中等收入家庭的必需品。在较富裕的地区，录相机已相当普及。目前，印度全国大约有10万个经营录相机和录相带的商店，录相放映点遍及印度各地，导致电影院上座率急剧下降。这些放映点每天营业十几个小时，放映最新上映的电影录相。经营者们不断地将市场上公映的新影片制成录相带公开出售，或出租给录相机拥有者。有些影片上映不到一星期，录相带就已出现在商店的柜台上。这些录相带大多属于非法录制，严重侵犯了电影版权。然而，政府有关部门对此似乎不闻不问，任其发展。甚至新影片发行才几小时，就被制成录相带，在黑市上出售。
    录相机的迅速普及，使昔日电影业的繁荣景象一去不复返。电影院前的长龙也不见了，显得冷冷清清。只有少数几部影片勉强维持连续放映两个星期。去年，全国大约1.2万家电影院因上座率低，无法维持正常营业而关闭。
    最近，印度电影界一些头面人物成立了“反侵权行动委员会”，力图改变电影业目前的被动局面。
    印度电影协会主席安纳德最近呼吁采取措施，加强对电影版权的法律保护，要求制片商削减电影成本，降低大明星的片酬，在影片制作方面创出新路子，以增强竞争能力，重新赢得观众。
