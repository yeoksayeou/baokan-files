"Nübu" Yabang washed her hands clean, draped herself in a crimson wool robe, and stood barefoot on a wooden plank. She chanted incantations and quickly entered another realm.

Following the slight opening of her eyes, a cluster of wooden poles adorned with white prayer flags could be seen on the slope of the Jiangga Mountain, which is a frequent haunt of mountain spirits.

"Nübu" is the most vibrant and god-like shaman among the Luoba people.

We went to Nanyi Luoba Township for an interview and happened to witness "Nübu" Yabang performing a ritual to drive away ghosts, sacrifice a chicken, and divine the future by examining the chicken's liver.

The Luoba people of Tibet live in the southeastern Himalayan mountains. Before 1959, they were still in a slave society, using slash-and-burn agriculture, and recording events with knots and notches on wood. They have a language but no written script. The Luoba people believe in an animistic religion, where they worship gods and drive away ghosts or sacrifice chickens to divine good and bad omens for birth, old age, sickness, death, marriage, building houses, hunting, farming, and harvests.

Last autumn, I watched a dance performance in Lhasa, where the duet "Ancient Theme" won the second prize in the Tibet Dance Competition. The dance, choreographed and performed by the Luoba actress Yai, left a deep impression on me. Yai explained that the dance vocabulary was mostly derived from her mother Yabang's movements of worshipping gods and driving away ghosts.

Outside the village of Nanyi, on a grassy hill, there were a few Luoba households. In front of Yabang's house, a dead eagle was hung high on a tree branch.

Throughout the divination ritual, Yabang continuously chanted incantations. Two bamboo sticks were stuck in the ground in an arch shape, with six thin bamboo sticks placed on top, representing the spirits of the six nearby mountains. The sick woman seeking a good omen also washed her face and hands, sitting next to Yabang.

Yabang took the small chicken killed by the sick woman, dripped its blood and feathers on the bamboo sticks, and chanted incantations over each of the six sticks. She then skillfully dissected the chicken's abdomen to take out the liver and examine its patterns.

The translator, Dagga, the township head, said: "Yabang, in the guise of a god, summons the spirits and asks them not to haunt the sick person, inquiring if the spirits want pigs or cows. The first chicken liver pattern was inauspicious, so a second chicken was killed, and this continued until a chicken liver with a good pattern appeared."

The sick woman, Yama, was 42 years old and lived 3 kilometers away in the new Luoba village. In February, she was bedridden with waist and leg pain. She invited Yabang to divine, sacrificing 50 small chickens to examine their livers. After her condition improved, she sacrificed 2 dogs, 3 cows, and 6 small pigs to the spirits. By the end of April, Yama's ankle became swollen and inflamed, so she carried a chicken coop to specially invite "Nübu" Yabang for divination.

That day, we saw Yabang take 4 hours to divine, sacrificing 8 small chickens. As for how many livestock to promise to the spirits, Yabang said she had not yet seen a satisfactory chicken liver pattern.

I asked, "Every year, just for divination and driving away ghosts, a large number of livestock are sacrificed. Does this affect the villagers' production and life?"

Dagga, the township head, smiled bitterly: "Of course. Some people even go bankrupt for divination. Now, livestock has been distributed to households."

While Yabang was sacrificing chickens and examining their livers to divine good and bad omens for the sick person, her daughter Yai was thousands of miles away in Lhasa, training in a spacious rehearsal room. Yai would soon perform abroad with the art troupe.

Talking about her mother, Yai's face was filled with pride: "My mother is extraordinary. Whether it's worshipping gods or divining, she is fully devoted. Unfortunately, the Luoba people have no written language, so we cannot record my mother's experiences in the spirit world. If my mother represents the Luoba people's beliefs and reflects the Luoba people's understanding of the world, then my father represents the Luoba people. He is a hunter, has hunted Himalayan tigers, can do carpentry, and weave bamboo products. The livestock and farmland at home are also taken care of by my father."

Yai was recruited by the Tibet Song and Dance Troupe at the age of 13 and sent to the Beijing Dance Academy to study for 5 years. She graduated and returned to Tibet in 1982. Besides dancing, she loves the works of Taiwanese writer Sanmao and writes some small poems herself. Just back from Beijing to visit her family, the stark contrast shocked her, especially at night when she witnessed her mother's ecstatic god-worshipping dance. Yai recalled that since then, her dormant ethnic consciousness was awakened, and for the first time, she felt a sense of responsibility and a goal: to introduce Luoba culture using modern dance art.

"Ancient Theme' portrays the bloodthirsty Luoba ancestor Abadani, who, under the call of the Sun Mother, regains his humanity, puts down his sword, and welcomes peace. It also expresses my hopes for my own people: to bid farewell to ignorance and walk towards enlightenment."

Yabang said she could enter the spirit world from a young age and became a "Nübu" at 11, sucking out two small dogs, each the length of two fingers, from the wound of a person bitten by a mad dog. Even now, at 63, Yabang has only been to the county town of Milin, a few kilometers away. She sighed, saying that now, the Luoba people who believe in "Nübu" are mostly middle-aged and elderly. Young people with minor illnesses go to the county hospital.

Yai has been married for half a year. Her husband, Gama, is a Tibetan from Garze, Sichuan, and studied English in India for 5 years. He is now a tour guide for the Lhasa Tourism Company. Yai offered me coffee, smiling: "In the past, it was impossible for Luoba people to marry outsiders. Now it's different. The important thing is that we have a good relationship and similar ideas."

Not long ago, Yai returned home to visit her parents. Her mother told her daughter: "You have been away for many years, and it's time to return to Nanyi. I will give you a few cows." Yai just smiled, because she had already decided to dedicate herself to dance art.

Interviewing Yabang and her daughter, I seemed to experience the long journey of social development in an instant.

### “纽布”亚崩和她的女儿

    “纽布”亚崩和她的女儿
    本报记者　刘伟
    “纽布”亚崩洗净双手，披上绛红色毡袍，赤脚立于木板上。她默诵咒经，很快进入另一境界。
    随她微张的眼看去，密林覆盖的江嘎山山腰有一丛挂白色经幡的木杆，那是山鬼常来往之地。
      “纽布”是珞巴族中最具活力、亦人亦神的大巫师。
    我们到南伊珞巴乡采访，巧遇“纽布”亚崩念咒驱鬼、杀鸡看肝纹占卜仪式。
    西藏的珞巴族生活在喜马拉雅东南山区，1959年以前还处于奴隶制社会，生产方式是刀耕火种，结绳刻木记事，有语言无文字。珞巴族信仰“万物有灵”的原始宗教，逢上生、老、病、丧、婚和盖房、出猎、耕种、收成，都要祭神跳鬼或杀鸡看肝纹占卜凶吉。
    去年秋天，我在拉萨观看了一台歌舞节目，其中获西藏舞蹈比赛创作二等奖的双人舞《古老的主题》，给我印象极深。编舞并主演的珞巴族演员亚依解释说，该舞蹈的语汇，大都取材于她母亲亚崩祭神驱鬼的跳巫动作。
    南伊村外草坡上，有几户珞巴族居民，亚崩家门前，树枝上高挑着一只死鹰。
    在整个占卜仪式中，亚崩不停念咒。两根竹棍呈弓形插在地，上面并置六根代表附近六座山山鬼的细竹签。求凶吉的病妇亦净面净手，坐在亚崩身旁。
    亚崩接过病妇杀死的小鸡，在竹签上，滴鸡血沾鸡毛，六根竹签逐一念咒，然后熟练地剖开鸡膛取肝，观其纹路。
    给我们当翻译的达嘎乡长说：“亚崩以神的身份召鬼，请鬼不要缠住病人，问鬼是否要猪或牛，第一个鸡肝纹路不吉，再杀第二只鸡，直到鸡肝呈现吉纹。”
    病妇叫亚嫫，42岁，是3公里外才召珞巴新村居民。今年2月，她腰腿疼卧床不起，请亚崩占卜，杀了50只小鸡看肝纹，病情好转后，杀了2只狗、3头牛、6头小猪送鬼。到4月底，亚嫫脚踝发烧肿大起来，她又背着鸡笼专程来请“纽布”亚崩占卦。
    那天我们看到，亚崩占卜用了4个钟头，杀了8只小鸡，至于许愿多少牲畜送鬼，亚崩说还没看到满意的鸡肝纹。
    我问：“每年仅是占卜跳巫，就要宰杀大批牲畜，对乡民生产生活有影响吗？”
    达嘎乡长苦笑一下：“当然。甚至有人为占卜倾家荡产。现在牲畜分到户了嘛”。
    就在亚崩杀鸡看肝纹为病人占卜凶吉之时，远在千里的拉萨，她的女儿亚依正在宽敞的练功房集训，亚依不久将随艺术团出国演出。
    谈起她母亲，亚依脸上充满自豪：“母亲非常了不起，无论跳神还是占卜，都是全身心投入。可惜珞巴族没有文字，不能记载母亲置身幽灵世界的感受。如果说我母亲是珞巴族信仰的代表，体现了珞巴族对世界的认识程度，那么我父亲则是珞巴人的代表。他是猎人，曾猎过喜马拉雅虎，会木工活儿，也会编织竹器，家里的牲口和耕地也是父亲照料。”
    亚依13岁被西藏歌舞团招生，送到北京中国舞蹈学校学习5年。1982年毕业回到西藏。除了跳舞，她最喜欢台湾女作家三毛的作品，平时自己也写点小诗。刚从北京回家探亲，强烈的反差使她震惊，尤其晚上目睹了母亲如醉如痴的跳神。亚依回忆说，从那以后她淡忘的民族意识复苏了，第一次有了责任感，有了目标，那就是用现代舞蹈艺术形式介绍珞巴族文化。
    “《古老的主题》表现嗜杀成性的珞巴族祖先阿巴达尼在太阳母亲召唤下，人性复苏，放下战刀，迎接和平。同时也表达我对本民族的期望：告别愚昧走向光明。”
    亚崩说她从小就可进入鬼神世界，11岁做“纽布”，从一狂犬咬伤病人的伤口吸出两只手指长小狗。直到现在，63岁的亚崩仅去过数公里远的米林县城。她感伤地说，现在信“纽布”的珞巴人多是中老年，年青人稍有小病便去县里的医院。
    亚依刚结婚半年，丈夫嘎玛是四川甘孜藏族，曾在印度学习5年英语，现在是拉萨旅游公司导游。亚依请我喝咖啡，笑着说：“要在过去，珞巴人和外人结婚是绝不可能的。现在当然不同了，重要的是我们感情很好，观念相近。”
    不久前，亚依回家探望父母，母亲对女儿说：“你在外面许多年，也该回南伊了，我给你几头牛。”亚依只是笑，因为她早已下决心献身舞蹈艺术。
    采访亚崩母女，我似乎瞬间经历了社会发展的漫长路程。
