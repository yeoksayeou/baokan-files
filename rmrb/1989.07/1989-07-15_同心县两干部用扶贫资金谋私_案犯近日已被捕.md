Two officials in Tongxin County, Ningxia, used poverty alleviation funds for personal gain. The culprits have recently been arrested.

Our reporter Huang Yiming reports from Yinchuan: The director of the Rural Construction Office of Tongxin County, Ma Zongguo, and the deputy director, Ma Yingdi, have been arrested by the public security authorities for misusing poverty alleviation funds to build personal residences and for selling poverty alleviation materials for profit.

In July 1988, Ma Zongguo and Ma Yingdi took advantage of the construction of auxiliary facilities for the county's agricultural technical training center to build two rows of brick and wood structures totaling 8 rooms in the county seat, with a total construction cost of 45,551 yuan. After the houses were completed, the two divided the back four rooms into two, turning public housing into private residences. Additionally, last year, the higher authorities allocated 860 cubic meters of timber to Tongxin County. Ma Zongguo and Ma Yingdi allocated 320 cubic meters of this to others for high-price resale, earning illegal profits.

This incident, after being exposed by the media, caused a great stir in society. The Secretary of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region Party Committee, Shen Daren, instructed: "This matter must be thoroughly investigated to the end. No matter who is involved, it must be dealt with seriously according to relevant laws and policies." Relevant departments overcame various obstacles and resolutely handled this case.

Currently, the case is still under further investigation.

    同心县两干部用扶贫资金谋私
    案犯近日已被捕
    本报银川7月14日电  记者黄翊明报道：动用扶贫资金为自己营造“安乐窝”和倒卖扶贫物资的宁夏同心县农村建设办公室主任马宗国、副主任马英迪，近日已被公安机关逮捕。
    1988年7月，马宗国、马英迪借建造县农业技术培训中心附属设施之机，在县城建造两排共8间砖木结构瓦房，总造价为45551元。房子建成后，两人将后排4间一分为二，把公房变成了私人住宅。另外，去年上级下拨给同心县860立方米木材指标，马宗国、马英迪将其中的320立方米拨给他人高价倒卖，牟取暴利。
    这一事件经新闻媒介披露后，在社会上引起了极大的反响。宁夏回族自治区党委书记沈达人批示：“这件事一定要彻底查清查到底，不管涉及谁，都要按有关法律和政策严肃处理。”有关部门排除种种阻力，对此案进行了坚决的查处。
    目前，此案正在进一步审理之中。
