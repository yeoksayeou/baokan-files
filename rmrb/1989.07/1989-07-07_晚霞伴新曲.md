The composer Wang Luobin, who is 77 years old, may not be very familiar to many people. However, his widely acclaimed songs such as "Grassland Love Song," "Alamu Khan," "Ma Yila," and "Under the Tall White Poplar Tree" have long been popular across the country. Unfortunately, due to historical misunderstandings, he was wrongfully imprisoned for 15 years, and his works were quietly attributed to "Xinjiang Folk Songs," "Qinghai Folk Songs," or "Anonymous," deliberately omitting his real name.

His life has been tumultuous, but his unwavering pursuit of songwriting has never changed. The waters of the Ili River, which have accompanied him through decades, are like an endless source of inspiration for his creations. During his 50 years in Xinjiang, he created, compiled, and adapted over 700 songs. After the fall of the "Gang of Four," his case was rectified, and he regained his artistic vigor. Not only did he compose numerous songs, but he also wrote several operas and song cycles. Recently, he composed a new song, "You Bring Happiness to Me," with lyrics by Tang Yu.

"You Bring Happiness to Me" is a light and lyrical song. The lyrics are clear and easy to understand, with a fresh and vigorous tone, vivid imagery, and a strong folk language characteristic. The lyricist skillfully uses metaphors commonly found in folk songs, comparing "you" to a blazing torch, full of passion; and to a mountain bird, fearless and determined, expressing the deep love between young men and women. The composer integrates musical elements from Xinjiang and Qinghai folk songs. The entire piece is permeated with a unique rhythm reminiscent of the hand-drum dance from Xinjiang, and seamlessly incorporates rock rhythms. Through techniques such as upper and lower modal progressions and repetitive variations, the melody flows clearly and smoothly, like a pair of lovers riding a swift horse and sweeping through the wind.

This song, with its concise and elegant structure and simple yet flowing melody, embodies a broad and deep, pure and bright emotion. It is indeed a fine work that combines both national characteristics and contemporary spirit.

    晚霞伴新曲
    苏元济
    王洛宾这位年届77高龄的作曲家，也许人们不很熟悉。然而他那脍炙人口的《草原情歌》、《阿拉木汗》、《玛依拉》、《高高的白杨树下》等一系列具有浓郁民族风格的艺术作品，早已在全国各地流传。遗憾的是，由于历史的误会，他曾含冤入狱15年，这些艺术作品也被悄悄地改为“新疆民歌”、“青海民歌”或“佚名”等字眼，而把他的真名实姓故意隐去了。
    他一生虽坎坷不平，但对歌曲创作的执著追求却从未改变过。伴随他度过几十个春秋的伊犁河的水流，如同他的创作源泉，取之不尽。在新疆生活50年中，创作、整理和改编了700多首歌曲。“四人帮”垮台后，他的冤案得到平反昭雪，又重新焕发了艺术青春。不但创作了大量的歌曲，而且还写出了几部歌剧和组歌。最近，他又谱写了由唐瑜作词的新曲《是你把幸福带给我》。
    《是你把幸福带给我》是一首轻松抒情的歌曲。歌词写得辞意明澈易懂，格调刚健清新，形象鲜明动人，具有强烈的民歌语言特色。词作者运用民歌常用的比喻手法，巧妙地把“你”比作熊熊的火炬，激情灼热；把“你”比作高山翠鸟，一往无前，表现了青年男女真挚的爱情。曲作者综合运用了新疆和青海民歌的音乐素材。全曲贯穿着新疆特有的类似手鼓舞的节奏型，并有机地把摇滚节奏糅合在一起。通过上、下模进和重复变奏等变化手法衍生发展而成。清晰流畅、一气呵成的旋律，犹如一对恋人驾驭着骏马飞卷出一阵风。
    这首歌在简洁精致的结构和质朴流畅的旋律中，融注了一种宽广深挚、纯洁明快的感情。确实不失为一首既有民族特色又具时代气息的佳作。
