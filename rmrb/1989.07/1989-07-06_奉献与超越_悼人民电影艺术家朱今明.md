In the afternoon of June 10th, the phone brought the sad news: Jinming had a sudden heart attack and passed away. My head buzzed, what? Jinming, you left so suddenly? You didn't even leave a word for your old friend.

For more than ten days, I couldn't eat or sleep well. I had quit smoking, but now I found myself lighting one cigarette after another. Jinming's image kept appearing before my eyes. We had been friends for over half a century, from being roommates in Shanghai's small apartments to performing anti-Japanese and anti-fascist shows across the country; from our internship in the Soviet Union to the days and nights we spent together pioneering the film industry of New China... Jinming, didn't you say you still had a lot to do? Now you rest peacefully among the flowers, silently accepting the condolences of your friends. I have lost a dear friend, and the people have lost a film artist.

In 1935, I met Jinming at the Mingxing Film Company. He was exactly 20 years old then, a year older than me. I knew he had been involved in theatrical activities with the "Left League" in 1933 and had joined Mingxing Company to work in cinematography in 1934. At that time, he was diligent and hardworking, doing every job he could and excelling in each one. I respected him and liked him, often visiting him. During that time, he also frequently went to the "Shanghai Amateur Drama Association" under the leadership of the "Left-Wing Drama Alliance" to work on stage lighting, earning the title of "Stage Lighting Artisan." In 1938, we parted ways by the Jialing River. I went to Yan'an, and he, along with Zhao Dan, Xu Tao, and Wang Wei, was introduced by Zhou Tiaofen to New Xinjiang to promote anti-Japanese progressive theater activities. We promised to meet in Yan'an, but it was ten years before we saw each other again. In 1940, Sheng Shicai orchestrated the "Du Zhongwei Incident," and Jinming and others were arrested and imprisoned. It was not until 1945, when Sheng Shicai was overthrown, that they were rescued from prison through various efforts.

In July 1949, at the first National Congress of Literature and Art, we reunited. We had been apart for more than ten years but were reunited. At that time, Jinming had already produced films like "One River of Spring Water Flows East," "Thousands of Lights," "Hope in the World," and "Sanmao's Wanderings" that shook the film industry. Jinming had collaborated with renowned Chinese film artists such as Cai Chusheng, Zheng Junli, Zhao Dan, and Shen Fu, learning from and working with the first generation of film artists to push Chinese film art to new heights of realism. I admired him, was shocked, and also felt proud for my old friend.

In the early days of liberation, Jinming shot excellent films such as "Shangrao Concentration Camp" directed by Shamon and "North and South Campaigns" directed by Cheng Yin.

Jinming was famous in the film industry for his mastery of shooting large-scale battle scenes and complex social activities, but his film language was also delicate and profound. He insisted on perfection in every shot. In 1976, when Jinming and Shui Hua went to Hainan Island to shoot a film, he was already 61 years old, working tirelessly with the young people every day.

Later, he directed films such as "Butterflies in Flight," "Spring," "Cai Wenji," and "The Peacock Princess," which only partially realized his ambitions. "The Peacock Princess" was beautifully shot, and many foreign friends wrote to praise it. In 1983, it won the Special Award at the Second Manila International Film Festival, the "Crystal Butterfly Cup" for the best children's film at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in Czechoslovakia, and the Golden Rooster Award for Special Effects Photography in China.

Recently, many friends have proposed holding a seminar on Jinming's film art, and I fully support this. His exploration of film language reflects his historical awareness and the strength of his thoughts, which are the qualities of a great artist. In 1964, when shooting "Eternal Life in Flames," color films had already become popular in China, but Jinming, who was one of the first to successfully use color film in China, proposed shooting a black-and-white film to express the party's arduous struggle with a deep tone. Shui Hua (the director of the film) and I agreed, and the result was indeed ideal, not just a historical reenactment.

In 1959, Jinming's contribution to bringing the play "Storm" to the screen was significant. It is not easy to successfully adapt a stage play into a film, but Jinming was familiar with both fields. Therefore, Jin Shan (the director of the film, who also played the role of Lawyer Shi Yang) recommended Jinming to me. I was immediately reassured and handed the task over to him without worry. There is a scene where Lawyer Shi Yang argues at the station, requiring the camera to move through 10 positions to show Shi Yang's eloquence. The shot, lasting 340 feet, was completed in one take by Jinming. It was called "a masterpiece of Chinese film" by the cinematography community. Due to the continuous movement of the camera, Jin Shan's performance reached its peak.

In the 1940s, he read Gorky's original work "The Mother" in a Russian dictionary while in Sheng Shicai's prison, made a two-stringed fiddle from a broken can to entertain himself, and learned weaving and embroidery with a few broken needles. He always remained optimistic about life. Seeing the achievements of the younger generation, he was genuinely happy; seeing problems in the film industry, he was anxious, distressed, and heartbroken. At the beginning of this year, he was critically ill with a cerebral hemorrhage and hospitalized. We went to visit him, and he still couldn't forget the Chinese film industry to which he had dedicated his life.

Those who have worked with him or had contact with him all say that in life, he was a kind and benevolent old man, but at work, he was "unforgiving to relatives"; for the sake of China's film industry, he devoted himself entirely, never seeking anything for himself. His artistic integrity was not just a matter of being a good person; he had completely transcended himself.

Jinming's life was one of dedication to the people and to art.

Rest in peace, Jinming!

    奉献与超越
    ——悼人民电影艺术家朱今明
    汪洋
    6月10日下午，电话里传来噩耗：今明心脏病突发猝然辞世。我脑袋“嗡”的一下，怎么？今明，你就这样走了？竟没有给老朋友留下一句话。
    十几天里，我吃不香睡不熟，已停掉的烟重又一支支燃在手中，眼前总是今明的影子。半个多世纪的交情哦，从上海亭子间的小伙伴，到转战南北的抗日救亡演出；从苏联的实习生活，到为开拓新中国电影事业共同度过的日日夜夜……今明，你不是对我说还有许多事要做么？如今你安详地睡在鲜花丛中，默默地接受朋友们的哀悼。我失去了一位挚友，人民失去了一位电影艺术家。
    1935年我和今明在明星影片公司相识。他那时整20岁，比我大一岁，我知道他1933年在“左联”从事戏剧活动，1934年到明星公司搞摄影。那时，他由于踏实、肯钻，什么活都干，几乎干一行专一行。我敬重他，喜欢他，没事就到他那里去。那段时间，他也常去“左翼剧联”领导下的“上海业余剧协”搞舞台照明，被誉为舞台照明美术家。1938年，我们在嘉陵江边分手。我去了延安，他和赵丹、徐韬、王为一经邹韬奋介绍要到新疆开展抗日进步戏剧活动。我们相约在延安会合，不料，一别就是10年。1940年，盛世才制造“杜重远事件”，今明等先后被捕入狱。直到1945年盛世才倒台，才经多方营救出狱。
    1949年7月，在全国第一届文代会上我们重逢。我们分开了十余年又汇合在一起。那时候，今明已拍摄出《一江春水向东流》、《万家灯火》、《希望在人间》、《三毛流浪记》等轰动影坛的片子。今明先后与我国著名电影艺术家蔡楚生、郑君里、赵丹、沈浮等合作，耳濡目染，与第一代电影艺术家们共同把我国电影艺术推向现实主义新高峰。我叹服，震惊，也为老朋友感到自豪。
    解放初期，今明先后拍摄了沙蒙导演的《上饶集中营》和成荫导演的《南征北战》等优秀影片。
    今明以擅长拍千军万马的场面和复杂的社会活动而著称影坛，但他的电影语言也不乏细腻、隽永。他拍的东西，讲究每一个镜头都精益求精。1976年今明和水华到海南岛拍片时已是61岁的人了，整天和年轻人一起苦干。
    以后陆续导演的《彩蝶纷飞》、《春天》、《蔡文姬》和《孔雀公主》只是部分地实现了他的抱负。《孔雀公主》拍得美极了，很多外国朋友来信赞誉它。1983年获第二届马尼拉国际电影节特别奖，捷克“卡罗维发利国际电影节”儿童故事片首奖“水晶蝴蝶杯”奖，并在国内获特技摄影金鸡奖。
    最近，有许多朋友提议开今明电影艺术研讨会，我非常赞成。他在电影语言方面的探索反映了他的历史感和思想的力量，这正是一个大艺术家所具有的素质。1964年拍《烈火中永生》时，彩色片已在国内流行，而最先在国内成功地试用彩色片的今明却提出拍黑白片，用深沉的基调来表现我党那段艰苦卓绝的斗争。我和水华（该片导演）都同意了，拍出来果然极为理想，已不单纯是历史的再现。
    1959年把话剧《风暴》搬上银幕是今明一大贡献。舞台戏改电影不易成功，今明恰恰熟悉这两个领域。所以，金山（该片导演，并在其中饰演施洋律师）向我点朱今明的将。我一听就放心了，把事交给他没有不成的。有一场施洋律师车站说理的戏，要表现施洋的雄辩口才，摄影机先后移动了10个镜位，长达340英尺的镜头，今明一气呵成。被摄影界称为“中国电影史上的造型绝句”。由于镜头运动的连贯，金山的表演情绪层层激昂及至进入最佳状态。
    40年代，他在盛世才的监狱里靠一本俄文辞典读完了高尔基的原著《母亲》，用破罐头制成二胡自娱，靠几根破针学会了编织、刺绣，他始终对生活充满了信心。看到年轻一代取得了成就，他由衷地高兴；看到电影事业出现问题，他焦虑不安、痛心疾首。今年初，他小脑出血病危住院，我们去医院看他，他念念不忘的依然是他为之献身的中国电影事业。
    与他共事过、接触过的人都说，生活里他是位和蔼、慈祥的老者，但工作中却“六亲不认”；为了中国的电影事业，他全部的奉献了自己，却从不为个人索取一点一滴。他艺德高尚，不光是个做人的问题，他已经完全超越了自我。
    今明的一生是无愧于人民、无愧于艺术的一生。
    安息吧，今明！（附图片）
