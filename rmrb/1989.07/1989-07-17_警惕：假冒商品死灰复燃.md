Beware: Counterfeit Goods Resurge

People's Daily reporter Pan Gang

Information from various sources indicates that the trend of counterfeit and substandard goods, which has been "severely cracked down" multiple times, is resurging. The main signs are the influx of counterfeit liquor, fake pesticides, fake daily necessities, and substandard electrical appliances into the market. In the first quarter of this year, the China Consumer Association and 20 provincial, autonomous region, and municipal consumer associations received a total of 29,000 consumer complaints, a 55.1% increase over the same period last year. Among these, 71.2% were quality-related complaints, and complaints about counterfeit goods and trademark infringements increased by 361.1% compared to the same period last year.

Before and after the Spring Festival, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision conducted spot checks in 10 major cities and found that low-quality and counterfeit goods were quite serious. Among them, white liquor was the most prevalent. The Xi'an Municipal Bureau of Standard Metrology inspected four department stores selling Xifeng liquor and found that all were counterfeit. Officials from the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Standard Metrology randomly entered a business department in Haizhu District and discovered 10 boxes of counterfeit Wuliangye.

From January to May this year, relevant departments in Shandong Province tested 480 pesticides from Dezhou and Huimin, and found that 360 of them were substandard or counterfeit, with 26% of the pesticides having zero effective ingredients.

In Zhejiang Province, a major fish meal production area, relevant departments inspected 18 fish meal factories in a certain township and found that none of them were up to standard. Among them, 11 batches of products contained harmful bacteria and were unsuitable for livestock consumption.

After the Spring Festival, the Chinese Institute for Drug Control inspected four medicinal material distribution centers in Zhangshu, Bozhou, Yuxian, and Baiquan and found that counterfeit and substandard medicinal materials were rampant: counterfeit Shan Zhu Yu included jujube skin and cassia bark; counterfeit Shan Yao was cassava; counterfeit Chan Su lacked the characteristic prickly sensation...

The National Fiber Testing Bureau's inspection team visited Sichuan and found that some woolen mills and blanket factories in Chengdu, Chongqing, and Leshan had purchased wool from Hebei Province containing a large amount of dolomite powder and quartz powder, resulting in direct economic losses of over a million yuan for these enterprises.

Recently, in Jilin, Heilongjiang, Guangxi, Guizhou, Gansu, and Xinjiang, a large number of "shoes" made from artificial leather instead of cow or sheep leather, and "tourist shoes" with horse manure paper lining and sawdust soles were discovered.

Notably, the proliferation of counterfeit and substandard goods has even affected exports. Before the Spring Festival, the Shanghai Entry-Examination and Inspection Bureau inspected sesame from Jiangxi Changdu, Jiujiang, and Jingdezhen and found that the impurities were 10.72%, 13.42%, and 21.98%, respectively. The Shanghai Grain and Oil Import and Export Corporation inspected sesame purchased from Anhui and Henan and found that out of 37 batches, 36 were substandard, with the highest impurity content reaching 23.6%. The national standard for sesame impurity content is not to exceed 3%, and the foreign trade standard is not to exceed 2%.

According to an analysis, the resurgence of counterfeit and substandard goods is due to some lawless elements taking advantage of the shortage of certain goods in the market, driven by greed to adulterate products. However, the main reason is that some state-owned commercial departments, including a significant number of "official speculators," are only concerned with making money, operating blindly, and engaging in deception, thereby aiding and abetting the problem. Additionally, the financial system of "eating from separate stoves" and the "block-by-block" responsibility system in cadre management have led some law enforcement agencies to go through the motions in "strict enforcement."

On January 7th of this year, the Guiyang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's Market Inspection Team seized 1,800 bottles of fake Maotai liquor, 1,900 sets of fake Maotai liquor labels, and over 1,900 empty bottles of fake Maotai liquor at the service department of the Guiyang Command of the Second Railway Bureau. However, the relevant personnel remained unrepentant, attempted to bribe the investigating officers with 10,000 yuan the next day (which was rejected), and continued to hide a large amount of fake liquor. On April 4th of this year, the Guiyang Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce's Inspection Team received a tip from the public and seized over 5,700 bottles of counterfeit liquor at the same service department.

Some lawless elements severely adulterate products, and relevant departments fail to enforce the law, causing many people to develop a sense of luck, comparison, and revenge. "If you do it, I'll do it too," "If you don't adulterate, you'll lose out." Someone asked a farmer who was adulterating grain, and the farmer said, "I bought 300 pounds of phosphate fertilizer, but the crops didn't yield more and instead ruined the land. When I had it checked, it turned out to be some crushed stone. Those who get the short end of the stick, you sell fakes and cheat me, so I'll let you taste the bitterness of fakes too!"

Relevant officials pointed out that the General Office of the State Council recently forwarded the State Bureau of Technical Supervision's "Opinions on Severely Punishing Those Responsible for Selling Counterfeit and Substandard Goods," which will undoubtedly play a role in suppressing the circulation of counterfeit and substandard goods. However, to comprehensively stop the trend of counterfeit and substandard goods, it is necessary for various departments and regions to take measures, cooperate with each other, and work together to comprehensively address the issue.

### 警惕：假冒商品死灰复燃

    警惕：假冒商品死灰复燃
    本报记者　潘岗
    来自各方面的信息表明，几经“严厉查处”的假冒、伪劣商品风，近来又呈“死灰复燃”之势。主要标志是假酒、假农药、假日用品、劣质电器等商品不断冲击市场。今年一季度，中国消费者协会和20个省、自治区、直辖市消费者协会共受理消费者投诉2.9万余件，比去年同期增长55.1％，其中投诉质量问题的占71.2％，而假冒商品、仿冒商标投诉比去年同期增长361.1％。
    春节前后，国家技术监督局在10大城市抽查发现，低劣、假冒商品相当严重。其中尤以白酒为最。西安市标准计量局对4个百货商场销售的西凤酒进行抽查检验，发现全是假货；广州市标准计量局的同志随意走进海珠区某营业部，便查出10箱假冒五粮液。
    山东省有关部门今年1—5月化验德州、惠民等地送检农药480个，不合格的假劣农药达360个，其中26％的农药有效成份为零。
    在鱼粉主要产区浙江省，有关部门抽查了某乡18家鱼粉厂生产的鱼粉，无一家合格。其中有11批次的产品含有害菌种，根本不能供家畜食用。
    中国药品生物制品检定所春节后对樟树、亳州、禹县、百泉4个中药材集散地进行调查，发现在那里伪劣药材比比皆是：山茱萸的伪品有大枣皮、山桂皮等；山药伪品为木薯；蟾酥伪品无刺麻舌感……
    国家纤维检测局调查组去四川了解到，成都、重庆、乐山等地一些毛纺厂、毛毯厂，因去年从河北威省购进了掺有大量白云石粉、石英粉的羊毛，使这些企业直接经济损失达上百万元。
    近来在吉林、黑龙江、广西、贵州、甘肃新疆等地，还发现了大量用人造革冒充牛、羊皮的“皮鞋”，用马粪纸作衬、锯沫垫底的“旅游鞋”。
    值得注意的是，假冒伪劣商品泛滥成灾，有的已危及出口。上海进出口商品检验局年前对来自江西昌都、九江、景德镇的芝麻进行检验，杂质分别为10.72％、13.42％和21.98％；上海粮油进出口公司验收从安徽、河南收购来的芝麻，抽验37批，36批不合格，杂质最高的一批为23.6％。而国家规定芝麻杂质含量不得超过3％，外贸规定不得超过2％。
    据分析，假冒商品、伪劣商品再度泛滥，除一些不法分子趁市场某些商品紧缺之机，利欲熏心掺假外，主要是一些国营商业部门，包括为数不少的“官倒”，只顾赚钱，盲目经营，弄虚作假，助纣为虐。另外，财政上的分灶吃饭和干部管理上的“块块”负责，也使得一些执法机关在“严肃查处”上“走了过场”。
    今年元月7日，贵阳市工商局市场检查大队在铁二局贵阳指挥部服务部查获假茅台酒1800瓶，假茅台酒商标标识1900套、假茅台酒空瓶1900多个。但有关人士执迷不悟，次日用一万元公款向办案人员行贿（被拒绝），并继续隐藏大量假酒。今年4月4日，贵阳市工商局检查大队接到群众举报，又在该服务部查获冒牌酒5700多瓶。
    少数不法分子严重掺假，有关部门查处不力，使相当多的人产生侥幸、攀比和报复心理，你做初一，我做初二，“不掺白吃亏”。有人问过一位正在往粮食里掺杂的农民，这位农民称：“俺买的300斤磷肥上到地里，庄稼没多收，反把地弄坏了，找人一看，原来是一些粉碎的石头面子。挨刀子的，你卖假的坑俺，俺也叫你尝尝假的滋味！”
    有关人士指出，国务院办公厅日前转发了国家技术监督局《关于严厉惩处经销伪劣商品责任者的意见》，对流通环节经销假劣商品无疑会起到抑制作用。但要全面制止假、劣商品风，还需要各部门、各地区采取措施，相互配合，下大气力综合治理。
