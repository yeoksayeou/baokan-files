Since the prices of imported cigarettes were raised last July, cigarette smuggling in Guangdong Province has become increasingly rampant. The Guangdong Provincial Anti-Smuggling Department has seized 56,000 cases of smuggled cigarettes in 1988, which is 2.8 times the amount seized in 1987. In the first half of this year, 70,000 cases have been seized, which is 1.25 times the amount seized in all of last year. Calculating at a tariff of 1,500 yuan per case, the losses to national tax revenue for last year and the first half of this year are estimated to be over 300 million yuan and 225 million yuan, respectively.
