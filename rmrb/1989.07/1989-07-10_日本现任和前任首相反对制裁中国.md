Former Prime Minister Nakasone said that Japan is geographically closest to China and has close economic ties, so Japan should express its own stance based on its unique situation.

Former Prime Minister Suzuki advised Uno to adopt a stance of refusal regarding collective sanctions against China at the summit of developed countries.

Former Prime Minister Takeshita expressed approval of the Japanese government's recent policy towards China and urged Uno to adopt a cautious attitude towards the China issue at the summit of developed countries.
