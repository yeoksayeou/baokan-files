    Disaster-Affected Areas Safely Navigate Spring Hunger Period
    No Large-Scale Population Migration or Abnormal Situations Occurred

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28th - Reporter Wang Jinhu reports: Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Commerce, He Jihai, revealed today that although various regions in China were severely affected by disasters last year, causing difficulties for the people's lives and production in the disaster areas, under the leadership of various levels of Party committees and governments, and through the efforts of the grain departments and other departments, arrangements have been made to ensure the food supply for the people in the disaster areas. In the first half of this year, there has been no large-scale population migration or other abnormal situations due to a lack of grain, and the spring hunger period has been safely navigated.

    It is reported that to ensure the organization and transportation of grain to disaster areas and grain-deficient regions, the State Council established a leading group for the organization and transportation of grain sources in the fourth quarter of last year. Local grain departments have considered the overall situation, followed the arrangements, and actively organized the transportation of grain. By the end of June this year, 2.64 million tons of grain had been transported to severely affected and grain-deficient regions such as Guangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Hainan. Temporary emergency grain had been transported to provinces such as Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, totaling 1.34 million tons. During the transportation process, the railway and transportation departments provided strong support, prioritizing the transportation of grain to disaster areas. The People's Liberation Army actively cooperated, dispatching ships and vehicles to assist in emergency grain transportation. The grain departments fully utilized the advantages of state-owned commerce, helping disaster victims to engage in production self-rescue, and effectively supporting production.

    He Jihai also told the reporter that although this year's summer grain harvest was abundant in China, due to regional imbalances, some regions experienced heavy rain during the harvest, resulting in abundant production but not abundant harvests. Some places still face summer hunger problems, and arrangements need to be continued to ensure the lives of disaster victims.

    受灾区安度春荒
    未发生人口大量外流等不正常情况
    本报北京7月28日讯　记者王锦鹄报道：商业部副部长何济海今天透露，尽管去年我国各地受灾严重，给灾区人民生活和生产带来困难，但在各级党委和政府领导下，经过粮食部门和其它部门努力，已对灾区群众口粮作了妥善安排。今年上半年，全国没有因缺粮而发生人口大量外流及其它不正常情况，安全度过春荒。
    据介绍，为了做好灾区和缺粮地区粮食的组织调运，去年第四季度，国务院专门成立了粮源组织和调运领导小组。各地粮食部门顾全大局，服从调度，积极组织调运。到今年6月底，给广西、贵州、云南、海南等重灾缺粮地区调进粮食264万吨，给浙江、江西、湖南、湖北、四川等省临时救急调粮134万吨。在调运中，铁路、交通部门给予大力支持，优先安排灾区粮食运输。人民解放军积极配合，出动舰船、车辆协助应急调粮。粮食部门充分发挥国营商业的优势，帮助灾民开展生产自救，有力地支援了生产。
    何济海还告诉记者，今年我国夏粮丰产，但由于地区之间不平衡，部分地区收获时阴雨成灾，造成丰产未能丰收，有些地方还存在夏荒问题，要继续安排好灾民的生活。
