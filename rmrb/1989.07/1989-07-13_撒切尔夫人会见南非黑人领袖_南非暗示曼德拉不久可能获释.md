British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today met with South African anti-apartheid movement leader Albertina Sisulu and discussed the issue of ending South Africa's apartheid system, but failed to reach a consensus.

This was the first time Thatcher had received a delegation from the South African anti-apartheid movement. During the meeting, both sides agreed that South Africa must abolish the apartheid system, but they held differing views on whether to impose comprehensive economic sanctions on South Africa. Thatcher's opposition to comprehensive economic sanctions has been widely criticized internationally.

Xinhua News Agency, Gaborone, July 12th.

South African Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee today hinted that imprisoned African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela might be released soon.

Coetsee said today during an interview with the South African newspaper "Citizen" that Nelson Mandela, who has spent 26 years in prison, is prepared to make a special contribution to South Africa's peace.

Political analysts in Cape Town believe that the South African Minister of Justice's remarks are a signal that the South African government might release this nationalist leader.

Coetsee also attended the meeting between South African President P.W. Botha and Mandela on July 5th.

    新华社伦敦7月12日电  英国首相撒切尔夫人今天会见了南非黑人反种族隔离运动著名女领导人艾伯蒂娜·西苏鲁，同她就结束南非种族隔离制度问题进行了讨论，但未能取得一致意见。
    这是撒切尔夫人首次接见南非反种族隔离运动的代表团。会见中，双方一致认为南非必须取消种族隔离制度，但在是否应对南非实行全面经济制裁的问题上仍各执己见。撒切尔夫人反对实行全面经济制裁的立场在国际上受到了广泛批评。
    新华社哈博罗内7月12日电　南非司法部长库切今天暗示，被监禁的南非非洲人国民大会领导人纳尔逊·曼德拉不久可能获释。
    库切今天在接见南非《公民报》记者时说，在监狱里度过了26年的纳尔逊·曼德拉准备对南非的和平作出特殊的贡献。
    在开普敦的政治分析家认为，南非司法部长的这番讲话是南非政府可能释放这位民族主义领导人的一个信号。
    库切也参加了7月5日南非总统博塔和曼德拉的会晤。
