The Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Science of China has been registered with the Ministry of Civil Affairs and has recently been established in Beijing.

The foundation's mission is to raise funds both domestically and internationally to contribute to the development of the country's education, science, and culture.

The foundation plans to provide scholarships for domestic science and technology professionals and outstanding young and middle-aged individuals to study abroad. It will also reward scientists and technologists who have made significant research achievements, inventions, or outstanding contributions in the fields of applied science, agricultural science, life science, and medical science, especially in the introduction of advanced foreign scientific and technological achievements. The foundation will also invite foreign experts and scholars to come to China for lectures, support domestic scholars to participate in international academic conferences, and promote scientific and technological exchanges. Additionally, it will support the research and development of applied sciences and the history of overseas Chinese and Chinese people, and assist in the development of scientific and technological achievements.

This foundation was initiated by overseas compatriots who voluntarily donated funds and have a deep concern for their motherland. The foresight and wisdom of these overseas patriotic compatriots have been praised and supported by the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, the State Education Commission, the State Science and Technology Commission, the Bank of China Headquarters, and the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese.
