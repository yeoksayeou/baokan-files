Researchers at the University of Cornwall in the United Kingdom have reached the following conclusion: narrow collars and tightly tied neckties can harm a person's eyesight. This is because narrow collars and tightly tied neckties compress the carotid artery, thereby obstructing the smooth flow of blood to the brain and eyes, leading to a decrease in visual acuity. Moreover, even after removing these "nooses" from the neck, the reduced visual acuity does not immediately return to normal levels. The harmful effects caused by wearing narrow-collared clothing and tying neckties too tightly can be particularly dangerous for car drivers and aircraft pilots.

    衣领与视力
    英国科尔涅勒大学的研究人员得出了如下这样一个研究结论：狭窄的衣领和系得太紧的领带会给人们的视力带来危害。因为狭窄的衣领和系得太紧的领带压迫住了颈动脉，所以便直接地妨碍了血液向大脑和眼睛的顺畅流动，从而导致了人们视敏度的降低。而且，即使去掉了脖子上的上述那些“绳套”，已经降低了的视敏度也难以立即恢复到正常水平。这种因穿用窄衣领衣服和把领带系得太紧而造成的有害影响，对汽车司机和飞机驾驶员来说则会带来尤其危险的后果。
