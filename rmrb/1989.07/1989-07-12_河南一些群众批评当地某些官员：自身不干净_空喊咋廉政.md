Title: Some Henan Residents Criticize Local Officials: Personal Corruption Undermines Anti-Corruption Efforts

Recently, during an investigation in some parts of Henan Province, reporters found that people have little confidence in the anti-corruption campaign. One major reason is that too many officials are involved, so anti-corruption efforts often end up being all talk and no action.

According to incomplete statistics, in the past three years, 2,252 officials in Jiaozuo City have built private villas and houses illegally. Among them, 43 are city or county-level officials, and 484 are section-level officials. In particular, some leading officials and powerful figures have taken advantage of the opportunity to build houses, illegally occupying arable land and recklessly encroaching on state and collective interests, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among officials and the public.

For this reason, last year, relevant departments in the city conducted an investigation and submitted a proposal to the municipal party committee and government to rectify the illegal occupation of land and the construction of private villas. However, after the proposal was submitted, it was suppressed by the city leaders. The reason given was: too many leading officials are involved, and taking action might cause trouble and affect work. At the beginning of this year, a provincial party committee investigation team came to the city and suggested that the municipal party committee take immediate measures to stop the situation. Therefore, relevant departments in the city drafted another emergency notice similar in content to the previous proposal and submitted it to the municipal party committee and government. Although the notice was revised many times, the tone changed from "steel whip" to "soft noodle," but it still could not be issued.

Some leading officials are shouting about anti-corruption on one hand, while using their power for personal gain and engaging in extravagant corruption on the other.

Taking the trend of large-scale private house construction as an example, in many places in Henan, county-level, and even municipal-level leading officials are living in spacious public housing while leading the construction of private residences. In Qinyang County, which considers itself to have done well in anti-corruption, almost all the leading officials of the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference have built private houses, with 60% of deputy county-level and above officials building private villas. Some officials have built houses in multiple places, and the area of land occupied far exceeds the upper-level regulations. The standard of the houses built is far beyond what ordinary people can afford. But strangely, when the county party committee's responsible comrades talk about this issue, they say that so far, the county party committee has not found any major problems in officials building private houses.

In Meng County, specific regulations on the construction of private houses by officials were made several years ago. But these regulations do not apply to the "county magistrates." A few county-level leading officials, taking advantage of their power, illegally approve and build private houses more seriously than ordinary officials, and relevant supervisory departments in the county dare not ask about it.

Due to the lack of relatively independent supervision and handling authority and corresponding supervision and investigation means, many comrades in the discipline inspection and supervision departments feel helpless. A responsible comrade from the discipline inspection commission of Jiaozuo City complained: "Now, many problems, although we know they should be investigated and handled, we are afraid that after the case is filed, it cannot be investigated clearly, and it cannot be handled, but instead, it will legalize the illegal things, so we dare not investigate and handle them boldly."

### 河南一些群众批评当地某些官员：自身不干净　空喊咋廉政

    河南一些群众批评当地某些官员：
    自身不干净　空喊咋廉政
    记者最近在河南省一些地方采访时感到，人们对廉政建设感到信心不足，其中一个很重要的原因是涉及干部太多，因此反腐败、治官倒往往有雷无雨。
    据不完全统计，焦作市近3年间乱建私宅和别墅的干部多达2252人，其中市、县级干部43人，科级干部484人，尤其是一些领导干部和实权人物利用建房之机，乱占耕地，肆意侵占国家和集体利益，引起干部群众的强烈不满。
    为此，去年市有关部门经过调查，曾向市委、市政府提出了关于坚决纠正非法占地、乱建私宅的意见。但意见上交后却被市领导压下了，理由是：涉及领导干部太多，一动容易出乱子，影响工作。今年初，省委调查组到这个市调查后建议市委尽快采取制止措施，为此，市有关部门再次起草了一份与上次意见内容类似的紧急通知，提交市委、市政府。虽然通知改了一遍又一遍，口气由“钢筋棍”已变成了“软面条”，可就是出不了台。
    有些领导干部一边大喊廉政建设，一边带头以权谋私，搞奢侈腐化。
    还以大建私房风为例，在河南不少地方，县级、甚至市级领导干部一边住着宽敞的公房，一边又带头兴建私人住宅。在廉政建设上“自我感觉还可以”的沁阳县，人大、政协的领导干部差不多都建起了私房，副县级以上干部建私宅多达60％。有的干部一人建房多处，有的占地面积严重超过上级规定，所建住房标准之高，内外装修之豪华，远非一般群众所能为。但奇怪的是，县委负责同志在谈及这一问题时介绍说，直到目前，县委还未发现干部建私房中有什么大问题。
    孟县早在几年前，对干部建私房中的一系列问题作出了明确具体的规定。但这些规定对“县太爷”却不起作用。少数县级领导干部，利用职权乱批乱建私房现象比一般干部严重得多，县有关监督部门却无人敢问。
    由于缺乏相对独立的监督处理权和相应的监督办案手段，许多纪检、监察部门的同志感到有苦难言。焦作市一位纪委负责同志诉苦道：“现在许多问题，明知应该立案查处，可担心立案后查不清，处理不了，反而把不合法的东西变成合法化，所以不敢理直气壮去查处。”
