The State Council Office recently issued an emergency notice on speeding up the summer grain and oil procurement work, urging all localities to spare no effort to ensure the completion of the summer grain and oil procurement tasks.

The emergency notice from the State Council said that at present, the summer grain and oil procurement work is still in full swing. Various levels of government and relevant departments have attached great importance to it and have done a lot of work to complete the summer grain and oil procurement tasks. The broad masses of farmers, in support of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, have actively delivered the contracted grain, especially many large grain producers who have enthusiastically sold good grain and oil to the state, setting a good example. By July 10, Beijing Municipality and Zhejiang Province had completed their summer grain procurement tasks, while Hebei and Henan Provinces had completed more than 90%. For rapeseed procurement, Zhejiang Province has overfulfilled its task, while Shanghai, Sichuan, and Hubei Provinces and Municipalities have completed more than 70%. Other provinces and autonomous regions, due to bad weather, have had more sprouted and diseased wheat, but also due to poor management, the grain and oil storage progress has been slower than the same period last year. Now, the early and middle rice procurement is about to begin. If the summer grain and oil procurement tasks are not completed in a timely manner, it will cause great difficulties for future work.

The State Council therefore requires:

1. All localities should concentrate their efforts for a period of time to ensure the completion of the summer grain and oil procurement tasks. They should mobilize farmers to dry and deliver the grain and oil promptly. In areas with more sprouted and diseased wheat, they should study and formulate feasible standards based on local conditions to solve current problems. They should strive to complete the summer grain and oil procurement tasks before the early and middle rice starts to be stored.

2. They should actively procure negotiated-priced grain and oil. After completing the contracted grain and oil tasks, all levels of grain departments should find ways to procure more negotiated-priced grain and oil, striving to secure more sources. In the previous procurement of contracted grain and oil, various localities have done their utmost to raise funds, basically ensuring that the procurement is not done on credit, which is beneficial to supporting the next season's production. This is very good. All localities should continue to make efforts. In addition to ensuring the funds for contracted grain and oil, they should also actively raise funds for negotiated-priced grain and oil to ensure supply and must not stop or reduce the procurement of grain and oil due to lack of funds.

3. All levels of government should immediately conduct a comprehensive inspection of the summer grain and oil procurement and storage situation. Those who have done a good job in procurement and completed the tasks should be commended; those with slow storage progress should be seriously urged, and help should be provided to solve practical problems to promote the completion of the contracted tasks.

    国务院办公厅紧急通知
    抓紧夏季粮油收购
    力争在早中稻入库前完成任务
    新华社北京7月21日电　国务院办公厅最近发出关于抓紧夏季粮油收购工作的紧急通知，要求各地全力以赴抓好夏季粮油的收购工作。
    国务院的紧急通知说，当前，夏季粮油收购工作仍在紧张进行，各级政府和有关部门十分重视，为完成夏季粮油定购任务做了大量工作；广大农民群众为了支持平息反革命暴乱，积极交售定购粮，特别是许多种粮大户，踊跃把好粮油卖给国家，起了很好的带头作用。到7月10日止，夏粮定购完成任务的有北京市、浙江省，完成90％以上的有河北、河南省；油菜籽定购，浙江省已超额完成任务，完成70％以上的有上海、四川、湖北三省、市。其他省、自治区由于天气不好，芽麦、病麦较多，但也有工作抓得不紧等原因，粮油入库进度较上年同期慢。现在，早、中稻收购即将开始，如不抓紧时机完成夏季粮油收购任务，将给今后的工作造成很大被动。
    国务院为此要求：
    一、各地目前都要集中一段时间全力以赴抓夏季粮油定购入库工作。要动员农民抓紧晾晒，积极交售；芽麦、病麦较多的地区，要根据当地情况，研究制定切实可行的标准，解决现在的实际问题。要力争在早、中稻开始入库之前，如数完成夏季粮油的定购任务。
    二、要积极收购议价粮、油。定购粮油任务完成之后，各级粮食部门要想办法多收购议价粮、油，努力多掌握一些货源。前段收购定购粮油中，各地千方百计筹措资金，基本做到了收购不打“白条”，这对支持下季生产有利，是很好的。各地要继续努力，除定购粮、油资金一定要保证外，对议购粮、油的资金也要积极筹措，保证供应，决不能因没有资金而停止或少收购粮油。
    三、各级政府要立即全面检查夏季粮油的收购入库情况，对收购抓得紧、任务完成好的予以表彰；对入库进度慢的要认真督促，并帮助解决实际问题，促其尽快完成定购任务。
