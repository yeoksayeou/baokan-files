The folding of letters and their meanings:

1. Folding official letters: Fold the letter paper lengthwise, then fold the crease inward by 1 to 2 centimeters, and finally fold it crosswise. This method is also suitable for people with cultural refinement and intellectuals.

2. Folding love letters: First, fold the letter paper crosswise, then fold one corner into a triangle, and finally fold it lengthwise and crosswise into a rectangle.

3. Folding to show respect: Make an effort to expose the part of the letter that addresses the recipient warmly, so that it is easily seen when opened.

4. Folding to show humility: Fold the letter paper lengthwise into three equal parts, and when folding it crosswise, intentionally make the two ends of the paper one high and one low, with the lower end representing oneself, to express humility.

5. Folding to show affection: Fold the letter paper into the shape of an airplane, with the edges cleverly interlocked, wrapped from top to bottom, to symbolize deep affection.

    信函的叠法与意义
    1、公函的叠法：将信纸纵向对折，然后将折线处再往里卷折一到二厘米宽，最后横向对折。此法也适用于有文化修养、知识阶层的人。
    2、情书的叠法：先将信纸横向对折，然后在任意一角做三角对折再纵、横向交折成长方形。
    3、尊重的叠法：设法将对收信人亲切的称呼部分露在外面，便于打开时一目了然。
    4、谦让的叠法：将信纸纵向三等份折叠，在横向折叠时有意让信纸两端一高一低，以低示己，表达谦意。
    5、情意的叠法：将信纸折成飞机式，让信纸边角巧妙地对插起来，上缠下绕，以示情意缠绵之意。
