Since 1982, under the leadership of Hua Luogeng and Su Buqing as chief editors, and with the collaboration of 49 mathematicians, the editorial committee of the Chinese Encyclopedia's Mathematics Volume and the editorial department of the Chinese Encyclopedia have worked together. With the attention of renowned scholars such as Chen Xingshen and Yang Zhenning, and the contributions of over 300 mathematicians who wrote the entries, along with the hard work of the editorial staff, the "Mathematics" volume has finally been published. This is a collective achievement of the Chinese mathematical community.

This comprehensive mathematical reference work, compiled by Chinese experts and scholars, contains 869 entries, 1.8 million words, and 738 illustrations, including 162 color illustrations. While referencing foreign counterparts, the book also emphasizes Chinese characteristics. This is evident in the detailed and objective presentation and evaluation of China's contributions to mathematics from the past to the present. In this regard, in addition to the long entry on "Chinese Mathematical History" and various medium and short entries, Professor Wu Wenjun's overview article "Mathematics" provides a profound perspective on China's achievements and characteristics in mathematics, covering both ancient and modern times and looking at the global landscape. This is very meaningful.

In such a large-scale mathematical reference work, the "Classification Index" at the beginning of the text reflects the overall framework of the knowledge system and classification system, showcasing the organic composition, arrangement, and connection of entries at various levels. This is very important. For the selection and arrangement of entries, the book referenced multiple encyclopedias, such as the "Cihai" list of mathematical terms, the 15th edition of the "Encyclopædia Britannica" list of mathematical entries, the "Iwanami Mathematics Dictionary" classification list from Japan, and the "Mathematical Reviews" classification list of mathematical subjects (revised in 1980 and 1985). In addition to the overview article "Mathematics," the book includes general entries for various branches of mathematics and historical overviews, such as "Mathematical Logic," "Number Theory," "Algebra," "Geometry," "Topology," "Analysis," "Differential Equations," "Computational Mathematics," "Probability Theory," "Mathematical Statistics," and "Operations Research." Additionally, it includes separate entries for "Combinatorics" and "Algebraic Geometry." For example, differential equations, which are part of analysis, are listed separately as a branch due to their wide applications and extensive content. Similarly, algebraic geometry, which has become increasingly important in mathematics over the years, is a multifaceted field that can be studied from various aspects such as number theory, geometry, function theory, computational algebra, and mathematics. Therefore, it is also listed as a branch. Mathematics has many such branches, and each branch has many sub-branches. The relationships between branches and sub-branches are often interwoven and interconnected, making it difficult to provide a completely definitive order. Instead, a general arrangement is given, with cross-references through "See also" to supplement each other.

Due to various reasons, the entry "Mathematics of the 20th Century" was not included, and the "Chronological Table of Major Events in Mathematics" only goes up to 1900. These are regrettable omissions. Because the compilation took a long time and mathematics is developing rapidly, some content already needs to be revised and supplemented by the time of publication. These issues will have to be addressed in the second edition.

    介绍《中国大百科全书·数学》卷
    段学复
    自1982年以来，在以华罗庚、苏步青为主任的由49位数学家组成的中国大百科全书数学卷编辑委员会和中国大百科全书编辑部的共同努力下，在著名学者陈省身、杨振宁等人的关注下，通过300多位数学家的撰写条目，加上编辑部有关工作同志的辛勤劳动，《数学》卷终于出版了。这是我国数学界集体智慧的成果。
    这部由我国专家、学者编写的大型的综合性的数学工具书，共有条目869个，180万字，插图738幅，其中彩色插图162幅。在编写时，自然要参考外国的同类书，但又要有我国的特色。这首先表现在，要对过去到现在我国在数学方面的贡献给予较详尽的阐述和充分肯定，并作出实事求是的评价。在这方面，除《中国数学史》长条和一些中短条目外，吴文俊先生在所写的概观性文章《数学》中，用不大的篇幅，纵观古今，放眼世界，对中国在数学上的成就和特点提出深入的看法，是很有意义的。
    在这样一本大型的数学工具书中，正文前的《条目分类目录》体现出知识体系和分类系统的总安排的框架，表现了各个层次条目的有机的组成、安排和联系，这是非常重要的。对于条目的选择和安排，本书参考了多种百科全书，例如：《辞海》数学词目表、《不列颠百科全书》第15版数学部分目录、日本《岩波数学辞典》分类辞目表，还有《数学评论》数学课题分类表（1980、1985修订）。除概观性文章《数学》外，本书设置了通常的各分支学科和数学史方面的概述性条目，如《数理逻辑》、《数论》、《代数学》、《几何学》、《拓扑学》、《分析学》、《微分方程》、《计算数学》、《概率论》、《数理统计学》、《运筹学》等。此外又分别设置了《组合论》、《代数几何学》等。这里提到的微分方程，本是分析学的一部分，由于应用广泛、内容庞大，所以从分析学中分出，单独列为分支学科。又如代数几何学，一些年来它在数学中占有日益重要的地位，而且它是一个具有多方面性的数学领域，可以从数论、几何学、函数论以至计算代数学、数学等方面来研究，所以书中也把它列为分支学科。数学有很多这样的分支学科，每一分支学科又有许多小分支学科。分支、小分支之间又多交叉、渗透，因此很难给出一个完全确定的顺序，而只能给出一个大致的安排，交叉关系通过“参见”互相补充。
    出于种种原因，《二十世纪的数学》条目最后未列入，《数学大事年表》截至1900年为止，这些都是令人感到有缺陷的。由于编纂时间延续较久，又由于数学的发展迅速，在出版的今天已经感到有的内容需要修饰增补。这些都只有留待第二版去弥补了。
