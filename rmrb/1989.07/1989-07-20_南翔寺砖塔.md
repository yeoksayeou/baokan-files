The Brick Pagoda of Nanxiang Temple has been praised by the renowned architectural expert Mr. Chen Congzhou as a national treasure for three reasons: first, it was built during the Five Dynasties to the early Northern Song Dynasty, making it historically significant; second, all its components are made of bricks, with not a single piece of wood or stone; third, the pagoda is a pair, ancient, elegant, and exquisite, with extremely high aesthetic and artistic value.

The Brick Pagoda of Nanxiang Temple is located in Nanxiang Town, on the outskirts of Shanghai. The pagoda has seven levels and eight sides, with each level featuring a niche gate. The entire structure resembles a wooden pavilion-style pagoda from the Jiangnan region. The flame-shaped niche gates, simple straight-lattice windows, intricate dougong brackets, delicate balustrades, and elegant finial all exhibit a strong Tang and Song architectural style.

Originally, the Brick Pagoda of Nanxiang Temple stood inside the mountain gate of the Baihe Nanxiang Temple. In the 31st year of the Qing Dynasty's Qianlong reign (1766 AD), a great fire destroyed the ancient temple, leaving only the brick pagoda standing. Over the centuries, the pagoda has endured countless winds and rains, and its appearance has become weathered and worn. The base of the pagoda is submerged one meter below the ground, the surface bricks have crumbled to dust, the dougong brackets and waist eaves are nearly gone, and the finial and wheels have disappeared without a trace.

In late 1983, professionals from the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Relics Bureau and the Jiading County Museum conducted arduous surveying work on the pagoda. They examined every fragment of brick and tile on the pagoda, based on the remaining scattered components and artifacts unearthed from the ground, referenced a large amount of literature, and after careful study and repeated revisions, finally drew up a restoration plan for the ancient pagoda. In late 1985, the restoration project of the Nanxiang Brick Pagoda began. After more than two years of effort and an investment of over 200,000 yuan, the ancient brick pagoda of Nanxiang was restored to its former glory in 1987. Today, countless tourists visiting the ancient town of Nanxiang always linger in front of the ancient brick pagoda, eager to catch a glimpse of this rare gem of Chinese brick pagodas!

    南翔寺砖塔
  　赵春华
    南翔寺砖塔被古建筑专家陈从周先生赞誉为国宝，理由有三：一是建于五代至北宋初年，历史久远；二是全部构件为砖制，无一木一石；三是砖塔成双，古朴秀巧，有极高的观赏和艺术价值。
    南翔寺砖塔坐落在上海市郊南翔镇上，塔形七级八面，每级有壶门，整个塔身酷似江南木结构楼阁式宝塔。火焰形的壶门，简朴的直棂窗，精巧的斗拱，细腻的栏板和秀挺的塔刹，无不显露出浓郁的唐宋建筑风格。
    南翔寺砖塔原峙立于白鹤南翔寺山门内侧，清乾隆三十一年（公元一七六六年）一场大火将古寺烧得荡然无存，唯独砖塔劫后余生。千百年来，砖塔饱经风雨剥蚀，已是面目疮痍。塔基淹没于地面一米深处，塔身面砖酥成粉末，斗拱、腰檐等所剩无几，塔刹相轮已无踪影。
    一九八三年底，上海市文管会与嘉定县博物馆专业人员对砖塔进行了艰苦的测绘工作。他们摸遍了塔上的每一片残砖碎瓦，根据尚存的零星构件以及从地下发掘出来的点滴实物，参考了大量的文献资料，经过精心研究，反复修改，终于构画出了古塔的复原方案。一九八五年底，开始了南翔砖塔修复工程。经过二年多的努力，耗资二十余万元，于一九八七年南翔古砖塔重展雄姿。如今，络绎不绝的游人到南翔古镇游览，总要在古砖塔前流连徜徉，以一睹我国砖塔中的珍品为快！
