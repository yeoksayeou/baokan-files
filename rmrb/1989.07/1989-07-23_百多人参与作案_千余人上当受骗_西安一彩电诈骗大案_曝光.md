Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 22nd

The New City District Public Security Bureau of Xi'an today morning exposed to the media a highly publicized case involving the fraudulent sale of color TVs by Wang Helin, who was arrested yesterday in accordance with the law. Starting today, the public security authorities will begin returning the 410,000 yuan of recovered illicit funds to the defrauded victims.

Last November, some news organizations reported on this major case involving high-ranking officials' children, police escorts, and the illegal sale of color TVs for huge profits, which drew significant public attention. The leaders of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City paid great attention to this case, repeatedly instructing that it should be handled strictly in accordance with the law, without any interference, and that regardless of who is involved, legal action must be taken. Over the past 10 months, the investigators have visited more than 60 units in related provinces and cities, collected over 500 pieces of evidence, received more than 50 victims, and handled over 200 reports. They have basically clarified this major case involving 11 provinces and cities and 42 districts and counties, with over 100 units involved.

It has been confirmed that from October 1987 to October 1988, Wang Helin, along with some relatives and friends, engaged in the illegal sale of color TVs. He initially gained the trust of the public who were eager to buy color TVs by using tactics such as buying high and selling low. After gaining some influence in society, he began to engage in large-scale color TV business, using tactics such as overcharging and not delivering the goods to defraud money. After obtaining a large sum of cash, Wang Helin disappeared from public view, staying in various large hotels, eating and drinking extravagantly, engaging in prostitution, and spending money recklessly. A total of 1,052 customers were defrauded. Statistics show that Wang Helin and others illegally sold 3,738 color TVs, defrauding a total of 3.8 million yuan from the public for the purchase of color TVs.

During the investigation and trial of this case, a thought-provoking issue was discovered: while Wang Helin was defrauding money through "illegal sales," more than 100 people followed him, participating in the resale of color TVs and engaging in middleman profiteering. Among them, there were two children of former provincial and ministerial-level cadres, dozens of party members or officials, as well as teachers and personnel from public security, courts, judicial, tax, and military units. These 100 people made a total profit of 900,000 yuan, with 29 people earning more than 100,000 yuan illegally. The driver of the Shaanxi Provincial Judicial Bureau Reform Bureau, Zhao, drove the bureau's police car to transport color TVs for Wang without authorization to obtain low-priced color TVs; the deputy director of the Lanchou Military Rest Home, Yang Jianxiang, used his authority to commandeer military vehicles to transport color TVs for Wang; the platoon leader, Party, and soldier, Lü, of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, dressed in military uniforms to transport color TVs and escort money for Wang. Currently, 9 people have been detained for investigation, 13 people have been released on bail pending trial, and the rest will also be dealt with according to their circumstances, with party discipline, administrative discipline, and legal action.

    百多人参与作案　千余人上当受骗
    西安一彩电诈骗大案“曝光”
    新华社西安7月22日电　（通讯员刘毅、记者华年轮）西安市新城公安分局今天上午将公众十分关注的仵何林倒卖彩电诈骗巨款一案向新闻界“曝光”。诈骗犯仵何林于昨天被依法逮捕。从今日起，公安机关开始将已经追回的41万元赃款陆续发还给受骗群众。
    去年11月，一些新闻单位披露了这起有高干子弟参与、警车为其开道的倒卖彩电牟取暴利的大案后，引起社会的极大关注。陕西省和西安市领导对此案极为重视，多次批示要“严格依法办案，不受任何干扰”“不论涉及何人，都要依法处治”。近10个月来办案人员走访了有关省市60多个单位，取回旁证材料500多份，接待受害群众50多名，报案材料200余份，基本查清了这个涉及11个省市、42个区县的百余单位的重大案件。
    现已查实，仵何林自1987年10月至次年10月间，与一些亲友结伙倒卖彩电。他先是以高价买进低价卖出等手段骗取急欲购买彩电的群众的信任，待其在社会上取得一定影响后，便开始经营大宗彩电生意，采取多收费少交货、不交货等手段骗取钱财。仵犯骗得大笔现金后便不再露面，出没于各大宾馆大吃大喝，嫖宿，挥金如土，共有1052名顾客上当受骗。据统计，仵犯等人共倒卖彩电3738台，诈骗群众购买彩电款计380余万元。
    在此案调查审理中发现的一个令人深思的问题是，在仵犯通过“倒卖”大肆诈骗时，竟有百余人追随其后，参与转手倒卖，大搞中间盘剥。据查其中有原省厅局级干部子女两名，有党员或干部数十名。还有教师和公安、法院、司法、税务、军队干部。这百余人共牟利90万元，其中29人非法所得在万元以上。省司法厅劳改局司机赵某为了谋取低价彩电，私自驾驶该局警车为仵犯拉运彩电；兰空干休所副所长杨建祥利用职权动用军车为仵拉运彩电；解放军某部排长党某、战士吕某身着军装为仵拉运彩电、提送现款保镖押车。现已有9人被拘留审查，13人取保候审，其余亦将按其情节分别给予党纪、政纪、法纪处理。
