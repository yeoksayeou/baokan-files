Individual household operators' earnings have become a significant manifestation of social income inequality, which is one of the issues that the public is most dissatisfied with. Recently, we conducted an investigation into the income of individual household operators in urban and rural areas of Beijing, focusing on this issue. Below is a record of what we have learned.

How much do individual household operators really earn?

Apart from knowing their own earnings, it is difficult for others to ascertain the exact figures. However, the "wealth gap" between individual household operators and other social strata is already quite pronounced:

* Radios worth thousands of yuan, purchased mainly by individual household operators;
* Some female operators of individual household businesses wear high-end clothing costing thousands of yuan per set and wear not one but several gold rings;
* Private cars on the streets are most commonly owned by individual household operators and celebrities.

A large number of floating population has brought substantial income to individual household operators engaged in urban service industries. Among urban individual household operators (those with licenses), the highest earners are in the catering industry, with an average reported net income of 1022 yuan per household per month; followed by the transportation industry, primarily passenger transport, with an average reported net income of 935 yuan per household per month; and then the construction industry, with an average reported net income of 548 yuan per household per month.

In rural individual household operators, industries with closer ties to urban production and life have higher incomes. The highest reported net income is in the construction industry, with an average of 1084 yuan per household per month; followed by the transportation industry, primarily freight transport, with an average of 828 yuan per household per month; and then the handicraft industry, with an average of 485 yuan per household per month.

It should be noted that the reported net income of individual household operators is largely "hidden." The higher the income, the more it is concealed. According to typical investigations by tax and industrial and commercial departments, the actual income of rural individual household operators is at least 20% higher than their reported income; the actual income of urban individual household operators is at least double their reported income.

The Beijing Municipal Government Research Office estimates that last year, among the 100,000 urban and rural individual household operators in the city, approximately one-third had a monthly net income of less than 300 yuan; about one-tenth had a high income of more than 1000 yuan per month; and approximately 3‰ to 4‰ had an ultra-high income of more than 10,000 yuan per month. This means that there are about 10,000 individual household operators in the city with an annual income of more than 10,000 yuan; 300 to 400 individual household operators with an annual income of more than 100,000 yuan; and some individual household operators earning tens of thousands of yuan annually, becoming "millionaires" in a few years.

How significant is the unreasonable income of individual household operators?

According to the investigation and estimation, the actual income of urban and rural individual household operators in Beijing last year was approximately 7548 yuan per household, which is 3.77 times the average income of 2000 yuan for employees of state-owned, collective, and joint-venture enterprises in the city.

The income gap between individual household operators and employees is even more pronounced in some industries. The average annual income of individual household operators in the catering industry is 1536.1 yuan, which is 7.2 times the annual wage income of employees in the same industry in the city; the average annual income of individual household operators in the construction industry is 15254 yuan, which is 7.5 times the annual wage income of employees in the same industry in the city; the average annual wage income of cadres in municipal and district party and government organs is 1696 yuan, which is only about one-tenth of the average annual income of individual household operators in the catering industry.

It should be acknowledged that a portion of the high income of individual household operators is reasonable:

* Individual household operators do not enjoy the medical, pension, housing, and other labor insurance benefits that employees have, so their income should be higher than that of employees. According to this standard, this portion of the reasonable income of individual household operators is approximately 2000 yuan.
* Individual household operators invest a portion of their funds in operations. This portion of the funds should also yield returns. According to statistics from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, last year the average amount of self-owned funds invested in operations by individual household operators in the city was 2481 yuan per household. Calculated at an annual interest rate of 20%, the average return on funds per household is approximately 500 yuan.
* Many individual household operators work more than 8 hours a day.
* The income of individual household operators should also include management and technical returns.

Considering the above factors, the reasonable income of individual household operators should be approximately 4500 yuan per year, which is 2.3 times the average annual income of employees in the city. If calculated this way, in the actual annual income of 7548 yuan for individual household operators in the city, approximately 40% is unreasonable income.

Where does the unreasonable income come from?

Why can some individual household operators make a lot of money? The main reasons are that the state's management has not kept up, there are policy loopholes, and there are management gaps.

Tax evasion is a "trick" used by many individual household operators to make big money. An investigation of 46 individual household operators in Xuanwu District found that 45 of them were evading taxes.

The tax authorities once checked the tax payment situation of four individual household operators in Dazhalan District for the first half of 1987 and found that they had evaded a total of 48641 yuan in taxes in half a year, with the most evading 16021 yuan and the least evading 5086 yuan.

The owner of "Li's White Sheep Head" shop, who often sponsors social welfare activities, became a "model individual household operator" widely publicized in the newspapers and received many honorary titles. However, the tax authorities found last year that he had evaded 30,000 yuan in taxes.

How much tax do individual household operators actually evade? Since 94.5% of individual household operators do not have business accounts to check, no one can be sure.

A clothing individual household operator who was rated as an advanced worker admitted that the reported business volume was only 60% of the actual amount.

Some individual household operators in Haidian District admitted that their reported business volume was less than half of the actual business volume.

Some estimate that the tax collected from individual household operators is only one-third to one-half of the actual tax payable. The Beijing Municipal Government Research Office believes that last year, individual household operators in the city paid 100 million yuan in taxes, but the amount of tax evaded was not less than 50 million yuan.

Shortchanging, strong-arm selling, and cheating consumers are another way some individual household operators make big money.

A gold chain sold by an individual household operator for 32 yuan turned out to be a fake worth only 0.8 yuan.

A clothing individual household operator admitted that a suit sold for 1800 yuan had a cost price of only 900 yuan; a skirt bought for 40 yuan from Guangzhou was resold for 160 yuan.

Fruit-selling individual household operators often make money by tampering with the scales. You see that the bananas they sell are cheaper than those in state-run stores, but when you take them home and weigh them, a pound only weighs seven or eight ounces.

The saying "To get rich, you have to hire" circulating among individual household operators indicates that exploiting the surplus labor of hired workers is another important source of high income for individual household operators.

In urban individual household operators in Beijing, 22% hire workers. The highest-earning catering industry has 88% of individual restaurants hiring workers, with an average of 4 workers per household, and some hiring more than a dozen. A large number of migrant workers, especially young women from rural areas outside Beijing, have provided the cheapest labor force for individual household operator employers.

According to an investigation by the Beijing Municipal Government Research Office in 1987, the average monthly income of workers in individual restaurants in the city was 113.3 yuan; while the individual restaurant owners reported an average net income of 1007.62 yuan per household per month, which is 8.9 times that of the workers.

The differential income brought by good business locations has also exacerbated the sudden wealth of some individual household operators. Individual restaurants in areas with a high concentration of floating population, such as Wangfujing and Dazhalan, earn much more than those in remote areas. Some "golden" locations of individual stores rent out a meter-long counter for 2000 yuan per month. Some store owners rent out part or all of the counter and collect tens of thousands of yuan in rent per month.

The unreasonable income of individual household operators comes from multiple sources. To reduce the unreasonable income of individual household operators, policies should be improved and management strengthened from multiple aspects.

    个体户到底赚多少钱
    ——北京城乡个体户收入采访录
    新华社记者  夏俊生  新华社通讯员 史政言
    分配不公，已成为群众最不满意的社会问题之一；而个体户赚大钱，又是社会分配不公的重要表现。最近，我们带着这个问题，对北京市城乡个体户的收入情况作了一些调查，现将了解到的情况记录如下。个体户收入知多少？
    个体户的收入到底有多少？除了他们自己心里有数以外，其他人是很难弄清楚的。但他们与其他阶层的“财富反差”已经十分强烈：
    几千元一块的雷达表，购买者多是个体户；
    有的个体户老板娘穿的是上千元一套的高级服装，手上戴着不是一个而是几个金戒指；
    大街上跑的私人小轿车，个体户和文艺“明星”的最多。
    大量流动人口为从事城镇服务性行业的个体户带来丰厚收入。北京城镇个体户（有执照的，下同）主中，收入最多的是饮食业，自报纯收入平均每户每月1022元；其次是客运为主的交通运输业，自报纯收入平均每户每月935元；再次是房修业，自报纯收入平均每户每月548元。
    在农村个体户主中，与城市生产生活联系较多的行业收入高。自报纯收入最高的是房修业，平均每户每月1084元；其次是以货运为主的交通运输业，平均每户每月828元；再次是手工业，平均每户每月485元。
    应当说明的是，个体户自报的纯收入，绝大多数都打了
  “埋伏”，收入越高隐瞒越多。据税务、工商部门的典型调查，农村个体户的实际收入，至少高于其自报收入的20％；城镇个体户的实际收入，至少高于其自报收入的一倍。
    北京市政府研究室据此推算，去年全市10万城乡个体户中，每月纯收入在300元以下的，约占1／3；每月纯收入在1000元以上的高收入户约占1／10；每月纯收入在万元以上的特高收入户约占3‰到4‰。也就是说，全市约有1万户个体户年收入在万元以上；有300户到400户个体户年收入在10万元以上；有的个体户一年收入几十万元，几年就是“百万富翁”。个体户的不合理收入有多大？
    据调查推算，北京城乡个体户主去年的实际收入约为户均7548元，是全市全民、集体和合营企事业单位职工人均收入2000元的3.77倍。
    个体户与职工的收入差距，在一些行业更为悬殊。饮食业个体户平均年收入1536.1元，是全市同行业职工年工资性收入的7.2倍；房修业个体户平均年收入15254元，是全市同行业职工年工资性收入的7.5倍；全市党政机关干部年均工资性收入1696元，只是饮食业个体户平均年收入的1／10强。
    应当承认，个体户的高收入中有一部分是合理的：
    ——个体户没有职工所享受的医疗、养老、住房等劳保福利，收入应当高于职工。照此标准，个体户的这部分合理收入约为2000元。
    ——个体户把一部分资金投入经营。这部分资金也应有收益。据市工商局统计，去年全市个体户投入经营的自有资金平均每户为2481元。按年息20％计算，户均资金收益约500元。
    不少个体户每天的工作时间超过8小时。
    个体户的收入中还应有管理和技术收益。
    考虑到以上情况，个体户主的合理收入应为年均4500元左右，是全市职工平均年收入的2.3倍。如果按此计算，在全市个体户照主年均实际收入的7548元中，不合理收入约占40％。不合理收入从何而来？
    一些个体户为什么能够发大财？主要是国家的管理跟不上，政策上的空白，和管理上的漏洞。
    偷税漏税，是许多个体户挣大钱的“诀窍”。宣武区对46户个体户进行调查，发现45户偷税漏税。连一些被树为“先进”的个体户也不例外。
    税务部门曾对大栅栏地区4户个体户1987年上半年的纳税情况进行检查，发现他们半年内共偷税漏税48641元，最多的一户偷漏16021元，最少的一户也偷漏5086元。
    “李记白水羊头”店主，因时常赞助社会公益事业，成为报纸广为宣传的“先进个体户”，还取得不少荣誉头衔。但去年税务部门发现，他偷税漏税3万多元。
    个体户偷漏的税款到底有多少？由于94.5％的个体户没有经营帐目可查，谁也说不准。
    有位被评为先进的服装个体户，自报的营业额在同等规模的个体服装店中是最高的。但她承认，自报的营业额只有实际的60％。
    海淀区有的个体户承认，他们自报的营业额不到实际营业额的一半。
    有人估计，现在收上来的个体户税款，只是实际应纳税款的1／3到1／2。北京市政府研究室认为，去年全市个体户纳税1亿元，偷漏的税款却不下5000万元。
    缺斤短两，强买强卖，坑蒙拐骗消费者，是一些个体户赚大钱的另一个途径。
    有的个体户以32元价格出售的“金项链”，竟是只值8角钱的假货。
    一家服装个体户承认，他卖的标价1800元一套的西服，进价只有900元；40元从广州批发来的裙子，转手便卖160元。
    卖水果的个体户赚钱之术常在“捣鬼秤”上。你看到他卖的香蕉比国营商店还便宜，可是买回去一称，一斤只有七八两。
    “要想富，就要雇”。流传在个体户中的这句顺口溜，说明占有雇工的剩余劳动，是个体户高收入的又一重要来源。
    北京市城镇个体户主中，有22％雇工。收入最高的个体饮食业，88％的个体饭馆都有雇工，平均每户雇工4人，多的雇工十几人。大量涌入北京的外地农民特别是外地农村女青年，为个体户雇主们提供了最廉价的劳动力。
    据北京市政府研究室1987年的调查，全市个体饭馆的雇工平均月收入113.3元；而个体饭馆的雇主们，自报的纯收入平均每户每月就达1007.62元，是雇工的8.9倍。
    经营位置好带来的级差收入，也加剧了一些个体户的暴发。王府井、大栅栏等流动人口多的地区的个体饭馆，要比偏僻地区的个体饭馆收入多得多。一些“黄金”地段的个体门店，出租一米长的柜台一月就进2000元。有的店主仅出租部分或全部柜台，一月就坐收租金上万元。
    个体户的不合理收入来自多个方面，要减少个体户的不合理收入，应该从多方面完善政策和加强管理。
