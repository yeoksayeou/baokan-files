Since March and April, various types of tutoring classes, training classes, and crash courses have been springing up all over society. Nowadays, advertisements for such classes can be seen everywhere in newspapers, at the gates of primary and secondary schools, and on street corners. The institutions offering these classes include public primary and secondary schools, private part-time schools and kindergartens, educational institutions, non-educational institutions, collective-run schools, and privately-run schools. Some even use school classrooms or collective venues to operate. The types of classes are numerous: there are college entrance exam guidance classes, promotion enhancement classes, high school diploma certification classes, foreign language supplementary classes, and so on.

Social education has made up for some deficiencies in our country's educational system, meeting the needs of some people and gaining the approval of the masses. However, some institutions and individuals have encountered problems in the process of running schools, which have had negative impacts. For this reason, the Information Research Office of the Beijing Xicheng District Price Bureau investigated more than 20 social education institutions and individuals, revealing some situations that deserve the attention of relevant departments.

	• Weak management. Some schools or educational institutions, in order to increase the school's income, rent out classrooms to external units or individuals, allowing them to use the school's name for advertisements or to post recruitment notices. The school only collects the agreed fee and does not interfere with anything else.

	• Inadequate teaching resources. Some units lack teaching conditions and do not have the corresponding teaching staff, forcing them to run classes and not taking responsibility for the students. A certain primary school's college entrance exam tutoring class and vocational school certification class, for example, all have external teachers. Some of these teachers have been retired for many years, and some have not taught high school for many years and are not familiar with the college entrance exam. They also do not prepare lessons seriously. Some teachers are self-recommended, and the school does not conduct background checks. They teach for 2 hours and leave after receiving payment, taking no other responsibilities. Students have many complaints.

	• Lack of standardized fees. Each institution sets its own fees, resulting in significant differences. For example, a certain cultural palace's makeup class costs 30 yuan, while a vocational school's similar class costs 120 yuan. A television repair class at a school near Xizhimen costs 70 yuan for 120 hours of black-and-white TV repair, while another school charges 240 yuan for the same duration of color TV repair.

    社会办学中的不良倾向
    三四月份以来，社会上各式辅导班、培训班、速成班等纷纷招生。现在报刊上、大中小学门口、街头巷尾此类招生广告到处可见。办学的单位有公办大中小学，有民办各类业余学校与幼儿园，有教育单位也有非教育单位，有集体办学也有私人办学，也有借学校教室或集体的场所开办的。办班的名目繁多：有高考指导班、升学强化班、高中文凭取证班、外语补习班等等。
    社会办学弥补了我国教育体制上的某些不足，解决了一部分人的需要，受到群众的欢迎。但部分单位和个人在办学过程中也出现了一些问题，造成了不良影响，为此，北京西城区物价局信息调研科调查了20多个社会办学的单位和个人，反映的一些情况值得有关部门重视。
    ——管理不力。部分学校或教育单位，为了给学校增加些收入，把教室出租给外单位或个人，让其利用学校名义登广告或张贴招生启示。学校除按商量好的价格收费外，其余不管。
    ——教学力量薄弱。一些单位不具备教学条件，没有相应的师资力量，勉强办班，对学生不负责任。某小学办的高考辅导班、技校取证班等教师全部外请，其中有些人退休多年，有些人多年未教高中，对高考并不了解，备课又不认真。有些教师靠毛遂自荐，办学单位又不摸底，上课侃2小时，下课拿钱走人，其他概不负责，学生意见很大。
    ——收费无统一标准。各行其是，差距悬殊。某文化宫办的化妆班收费30元，而相同时间的某职业学校收费为120元。修理电视班西直门某校彩电120课时收费70元，另一学校黑白电视机120课时收费达240元。（6月19日《中国消费者报》）
