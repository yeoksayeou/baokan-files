Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 14th.

Premier Li Peng recently stressed that the National Quality Award activities must not decline. We must continuously improve and make the award evaluation work better.

According to reporters Zhang Guorong and Wang Xingzeng, Vice Minister of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision, Li Baoguo, recently stated at a meeting with representatives of award-winning enterprises that Premier Li Peng recently instructed that, due to organizational changes, the National Quality Award activities must not decline. We must work hard to ensure that they do not decline. We must also do better. As the overall situation of reform and opening up progresses, we must continuously improve our work.

Over the past 10 years of reform and opening up, China has achieved remarkable results in selecting high-quality products, awarding a total of 4,155 items of various national quality awards. The evaluation and promotion activities have played an important role in encouraging enterprises to strengthen their quality awareness and improve product quality.

However, there are also many problems in the evaluation work. In particular, over the past two years, many evaluators have engaged in evaluation activities for profit, which not only increases the burden on enterprises, deceives consumers, but also seriously damages the reputation of high-quality products, leading to a situation where "evaluation everywhere, worries everywhere."

According to relevant departments, in the future, national evaluation work will be planned, approved, and awarded by the state. The specific evaluation work will mainly be carried out by industry associations. The basis for evaluation will be the testing data provided by industry quality inspection institutions and user evaluations, to improve the scientificity, fairness, and authority of the evaluation work.

    李鹏总理最近指出
    国家质量奖活动不能衰退
    要不断改进使评优工作做得更好
    本报北京7月14日讯　记者张国荣、王行增报道：国家技术监督局副局长李保国日前在获奖企业负责人座谈会上说，国务院总理李鹏最近批示，由于机构变动，不要使国家质量奖活动衰退下去，我们要努力工作，无论如何也不能衰退下去。我们还要做得更好，随着改革开放总形势的进展，我们要不断改进工作。
    改革开放10年来，我国评选优质产品取得可喜成绩，共评出各类国家质量奖4155项。评优创优活动对鼓励企业增强质量意识，提高产品质量起了重要作用。
    但评优工作中存在的问题也不少。特别是近两年来出现了许多以营利为目的的评优者，这不仅加重了企业负担，欺骗了消费者，也严重败坏了优质产品的信誉，“处处评优处处忧”。
    据有关部门透露，今后国家评优工作要实行由国家规划、审定、发奖。具体评选工作主要依靠各行业协会负责。评选的依据是各行业质量检测机构提供的检测数据和用户评价，以提高评优工作的科学性、公正性和权威性。
