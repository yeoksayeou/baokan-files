Bank Manager Chen Jinchao, who led in watching obscene videos and raped a young girl, was recently expelled from the Communist Party by the Shangqiu County Committee. The public is outraged by the protection given to Chen by certain leaders and demands that the case be thoroughly investigated.

Chen Jinchao, 36, has been sexually assaulting and raping a 16-year-old girl since August 1988, causing her severe physical and mental harm. On the evening of April 20 this year, he and the director of the county branch of the People's Bank of China watched obscene videos. Later, driven by his bestial desires, he sexually assaulted and raped the girl for over an hour before being discovered and reported by the public.

On April 23, the county public security bureau accepted the case but encountered numerous obstacles. Certain leaders even argued that Chen's actions did not constitute rape, imposing only a 15-day administrative detention and a fine of 500 yuan. They also arranged for the county finance committee director to secretly take Chen away from the detention center in a car seven days early, under the cover of night. After the media exposed this case, they fabricated lies to confuse the public and evade higher-level investigations. Recently, under public scrutiny, the Shangqiu County Committee twice overturned the county branch's decision to give Chen a serious party warning, ultimately expelling him from the party. However, the public is still discussing whether the relevant authorities should pursue Chen's criminal behavior and how to handle those who protected him.

    行长陈进超奸污少女受庇护
    商丘群众强烈要求依法惩处
    新华社郑州7月17日电  （通讯员商恭纪）带头看淫秽录像、奸污少女的商丘县人大代表、县人民银行行长陈进超，日前被河南省商丘县委开除党籍后，广大群众对某些领导干部包庇陈进超愤愤不平，纷纷要求将此案查到底。
    今年36岁的陈进超，自1988年8月以来，对1名16岁的少女进行玩弄和奸污，使女孩身心受到严重损害。今年4月20日晚上，他和县人行办公室主任等人看淫秽录像。后来，他兽性大发，又对这个女孩进行玩弄、奸污达一个多小时，被群众发现告发。
    4月23日，县公安机关受理此案后，受到重重干扰。某些领导干部竟以陈进超奸污少女构不成强奸罪为由，只对他作了行政拘留15天、罚款500元的治安处罚，而且还让县财委主任等人出面，提前7天，在夜里偷偷把陈进超从拘留所用小汽车接走。有关新闻单位公开披露这一案件后，他们又编造谎言，妄图混淆视听，摆脱上级的追查。最近，在社会舆论的监督下，商丘县委先后两次否定了县行支部关于对陈进超党内严重警告的处理意见，作出了开除他的党籍的处分决定。然而，人们议论的话题是：有关单位是否应该依法追究陈进超的流氓犯罪行为？对那些庇护陈进超的人怎么办？
