The recently concluded fifteenth summit of the Western Seven Nations issued an "Economic Declaration" and several other political statements, reflecting the consensus among the leaders on issues such as East-West relations, environmental protection, and the debt of developing countries. This was not surprising. However, before the summit, some had hoped that the meeting of the seven leaders with over 20 leaders from developing countries for France's national day celebrations would include topics for North-South dialogue, but this did not happen.

In today's world, "developing countries need the help of developed countries, and similarly, the future of developed countries greatly depends on developing countries." (French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas) A large amount of evidence shows that dialogue, exchange, and cooperation between the North and the South are irreplaceable. On the eve of this summit, tens of thousands of people gathered and marched in Paris, and discussions were held for seven poor countries. In particular, the leaders of India, Egypt, Senegal, and Venezuela issued a joint statement in Paris, calling for the early convening of regular consultations for North-South conferences. However, none of this received the necessary attention at this summit. The lengthy declaration did not mention the North-South conference. Since the Cancun Conference proposed this issue, it has been eight years, and the wishes of poor countries have not been realized. This cannot but be said to be a major regret of the Western leaders' summit.

On the other hand, this summit made great efforts to elevate the status of East-West relations. In the context of the détente between the United States and the Soviet Union and the increasing rapprochement between Eastern and Western Europe, the summit emphasized Western relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe from various aspects, especially with Poland and Hungary. The summit tasked the European Community Commission to take measures to convene a meeting with 18 Western countries to specifically implement aid to Eastern Europe. From this, one can easily see that this was a summit that prioritized East-West relations over North-South dialogue.

The reason why this summit of the Seven Nations prioritized East-West relations over North-South dialogue is related to the attitude of the United States. On the eve of the summit, senior U.S. officials explicitly stated that efforts on environmental protection and debt issues should not be diluted by North-South dialogue. The United States also said that North-South dialogue is a "technical" issue and should not be "politicized." The host country of the summit, France, had expressed support for the initiative of the leaders of India, Egypt, Senegal, and Venezuela to convene regular consultations for a North-South conference, but the United States insisted on placing the common Western stance against the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the forefront of the summit.

Of course, in opposing the communist system and promoting freedom, democracy, and human rights, Western Europe shares many commonalities with the United States. Western Europe also hopes to develop East-West European relations from the perspective of its own security and economic interests. Therefore, in this summit, although some countries expressed enthusiasm for North-South dialogue, this did not prevent them from quickly reaching an agreement on East-West relations. If there is any difference, it is that the United States views the Soviet Union as a competitor, while Western Europe only requires that it not be threatened by a powerful neighbor.

French public opinion paid great attention to the consensus reached at this summit on East-West relations, and was also quite sensitive to the fact that the summit did not mention the North-South conference. Someone wrote: "This summit has lost its direction."

    重“东西”轻“南北”
    ——谈第十五届西方七国首脑会议
    本报记者　张启华
    本届西方七国首脑会议刚刚闭幕，会议发表的《经济宣言》以及其它几项政治声明，反映了各国领导人在东西关系、环境保护和第三世界债务等问题上取得了一致的看法，这并不出人预料。但会前，原来有人认为，七国首脑同20多位来自发展中国家的领导人一起参加法国国庆，想必会有南北对话的议题，却没有成为事实。
    当今世界，“发展中国家需要发达国家的帮助，同样的，发达国家的前途很大程度也取决于发展中国家。”（法国迪马外长语）大量事实证明，南北间的对话、交流与合作是无可替代的。此次会议前夕，巴黎成千上万群众集会游行，还组织了七个贫穷国家的讨论会，特别是印度、埃及、塞内加尔、委内瑞拉四国领导人在巴黎发表联合声明，呼吁尽快召开定期磋商的南北会议。但所有这些都没有引起此次会议必要的重视，洋洋万言的宣言没有南北会议的字眼。从坎昆会议提出这个问题迄今已经8年了，贫穷国家的愿望始终未能实现，这不能不说是西方首脑会议的一大憾事。
    事情的另一面是，此次会议竭力提高东西关系的地位。在美苏实现缓和、东西欧两部分日趋接近情况下，会议从各个方面突出西方与苏联、东欧的关系，特别是与波兰、匈牙利的关系。会议委托欧洲共同体委员会采取措施，召集一次有18个西方国家参加的会议，具体落实对东欧援助。人们由此很容易看出这是一次重东西、轻南北的会议。
    这届七国首脑会议之所以重东西、轻南北，同美国的态度有关。会议前夕，美国高级官员还明确表示，不应被南北对话冲淡目前在环保、债务问题所作出的努力。美国还说，南北对话是一个“技术性”问题，不应使它“政治化”。会议的东道国法国领导人曾表示支持印、埃、塞、委4国领导人发出的召开定期磋商的南北会议的倡议，但美国还是坚持要把西方共同对付苏联、东欧的立场放在会议的首位。
    当然，在反对共产主义制度、推行自由、民主、人权等方面，西欧同美国有许多共同之处。西欧从其自身的安全和经济利益出发也盼望发展东西欧关系。因此，在此次会议中，尽管有的国家对南北对话表示热情，但这并不影响它们迅速地就东西关系达成协议。要说有什么不同的话，那就是美国是把苏联当成竞争对手，而西欧却只要求不受强大邻居的威胁就行了。
    法国舆论十分重视此次会议在东西方关系达成的一致协议，同时对会议没有提到南北会议也相当敏感。有人写道：此次会议“迷失了方向”。
