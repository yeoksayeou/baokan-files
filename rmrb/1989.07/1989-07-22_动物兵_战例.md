On the battlefields of ancient China, humans and horses engaged in fierce combat, which is well-known. However, the involvement of birds and beasts in battles, leading to unexpected victories, is less known. Here are a few examples to share with the readers.

"The Fire Oxen Formation": In 279 BC, the state of Yan besieged the state of Qi. The Qi general Tian Dan gathered a thousand strong oxen, dressing them in red and green coats and tying sharp blades to their horns. He also tied oil-soaked hemp ropes to their tails. At night, the soldiers lit the hemp ropes on fire, causing the oxen to charge in pain towards the enemy camp. Following them, five thousand soldiers wielded swords and slaughtered the enemy, successfully defeating the Yan army.

"The Fire Chicken Formation": During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, General Jiang Tong was ordered to eliminate the Qiang troops. He instructed his soldiers to purchase five hundred roosters and tie them together with ropes. He then attached sulfur and other flammable materials to their tails. When the attack began, he lit the sulfur, causing the roosters to scatter in panic towards the enemy camp. The flapping of their wings and the blazing fire created chaos among the Qiang troops. As the enemy camp caught fire, Jiang Tong led his troops to attack, achieving a great victory.

"The Monkey Formation": During the Ming Dynasty, the famous anti-Japanese general Qi Jiguang noticed that monkeys on the mountain imitated soldiers by swinging sticks and brandishing spears. Qi Jiguang had an idea and ordered hunters to capture several hundred monkeys. He then trained them. After training, Qi Jiguang had his soldiers give each monkey a torch. The monkeys, with their torches lit, charged towards the enemy camp, setting it ablaze. The Japanese invaders were terrified, screaming and fleeing. Many were killed or injured. Qi Jiguang then led his troops to attack, achieving a decisive victory.

During the Qing Dynasty, Zhang Xianzhong's subordinate Liu Wenxiu's "Elephant Formation" and Guizhou military commander Yang Tianzong's subordinate He Jingwen's "Goat Formation" are also interesting examples of animals participating in battles.

    “动物兵”战例
    在我国古战场上，人马征战，激烈拚杀，尽人皆知。但飞禽走兽参战，并能出奇制胜的趣事，却知者不多。今录几例，与读者共赏。
      “火牛阵”：公元前279年，燕国围攻齐国，齐国将领田单搜罗壮牛千头，牛身皆披红绿褂子，牛角上捆两把尖刀，牛尾上系着浸透油的麻绳。深夜，士兵们一齐点燃牛尾油绳，千头被烧痛的壮牛拚命向前狂奔，直冲敌人营帐，后随五千壮士挥刀砍杀，一举把燕军击溃。
      “火鸡阵”：东晋将领江同奉命灭羌兵，他令士兵买公鸡五百只，用绳子把鸡一只只连住，后又把硫磺等引火之物系在鸡尾上。出击时，点燃硫磺，鸡群受惊，直冲敌营，加之翅膀拍打，火光熊熊。羌兵不知何物，吓得乱作一团。待羌营纷纷起火时，江同率部掩杀，大获全胜。
    “猴子阵”：明代抗倭名将戚继光，在操练兵士时，发现山上的猴子也学着舞棒弄枪。戚继光若有所悟，即命猎人上山捉猴。将捉来的数百只猴子进行驯练。驯成后，戚继光令军士给每个猴子一只火把，点着后直冲敌营，烧得倭寇哭爹喊娘，死的死，伤的伤，戚继光此时挥军冲杀，一举取胜。
    清代张献忠部下刘文秀的“大象阵”、贵州提督杨天宗部下何经文的“山羊阵”都是“动物兵”参战的有趣战例。
