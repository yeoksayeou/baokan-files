The State Supervision Bureau, in conjunction with the Chemical Industry Ministry, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, and the Supervision Bureaus of Hunan Province and Yueyang City, recently investigated and handled a case involving the production and sale of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals in Miluo City, Hunan Province. Miluo City Mayor Tang Zhenqiu was removed from his post due to serious dereliction of duty and negligence, and other responsible individuals also received disciplinary actions.

According to the investigation by the State Supervision Bureau, in recent years, the scale of production of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals in Miluo City has been expanding. By 1987, the city had 18 agricultural chemical factories, most of which did not meet the conditions for producing agricultural chemicals, as assessed by technical supervision and agricultural chemical inspection departments. To pursue excessive profits, these factories used substandard materials and counterfeit products, producing a large quantity of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals. These products were sold to 131 counties in 17 provinces and autonomous regions, including Hubei, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Sichuan, causing serious damage to agricultural production in those areas.

Since July 1987, the former Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fisheries, in collaboration with relevant departments, conducted two inspections of agricultural chemical production in Miluo City. They shut down 13 agricultural chemical factories and banned two unlicensed production facilities, while ordering other factories to cease production and undergo rectification. Tang Zhenqiu, who served as both the mayor of Miluo City and the head of the city's agricultural chemical production rectification leading group, knew that the rectification work was not fully completed. Without the approval of the relevant chemical industry departments and agricultural chemical quality inspection departments, he issued multiple directives in January and April 1988, instructing the city's Industry and Commerce Bureau to issue new business licenses to the Chemical Agricultural Chemical Factory, Chemical and Agricultural Chemical Factory, and the Dazhong Agricultural Chemical Factory. He also directed the issuance of a construction permit to the Xiangbei Agricultural Chemical Factory. These factories, along with five others that resumed production, did not comply with relevant regulations to obtain "registration certificates" and "production permits." In 1988, they continued to produce 5,773 tons of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals.

In December 1988, a joint investigation team led by the State Supervision Bureau inspected two agricultural chemical factories in Miluo City and found serious issues: 60% of the products from the Luocheng Agricultural Chemical Factory were fake and substandard; the Chemical Agricultural Chemical Factory produced 813.7 tons of fake chemicals and 628.6 tons of substandard chemicals. The joint investigation team requested that the Miluo City government send personnel to inspect other agricultural chemical factories, but Mayor Tang Zhenqiu was not resolute in his actions and did not effectively address the issue of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals.

Given Tang Zhenqiu's serious dereliction of duty and negligence in the production, sale, and prohibition of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals in Miluo City, the Hunan Provincial People's Government decided to remove him from his position as mayor and hand him over to judicial authorities for criminal investigation. The Miluo City government also took appropriate disciplinary actions against other responsible individuals. Additionally, relevant authorities in Miluo City have detained eight individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of fake and substandard agricultural chemicals, imposing fines and confiscating illegal gains.

    为生产销售假劣农药洞开方便之门
    汨罗市长唐镇球被撤职
    八名不法分子被收审　其他责任者受政纪处理
    本报北京7月29日讯　记者舒瑜报道：国家监察部会同化工部、农业部、商业部、国家工商行政管理局以及湖南省监察厅、岳阳市监察局，近日查处了湖南省汨罗市生产销售假劣农药案。汨罗市市长唐镇球因严重失职、渎职受到处理，其他责任人也受到政纪处分。
    据监察部调查，近年来汨罗市生产假劣农药的规模不断扩大。到1987年，全市农药厂发展到18家，经技术监督、农药检定部门鉴定，这些农药厂大多数不具备生产农药的条件。为了牟取暴利，这些厂采取以次充好、以假充真的手段，生产大量的假劣农药，先后销往湖北、江西、浙江、四川等17个省区131个县，给上述地区的农业生产造成了严重损害。
    1987年7月以来，原农牧渔业部曾会同有关部门，先后两次对汨罗市农药生产进行了检查，关闭了13家农药厂，取缔了两家无照生产厂，并对其它厂进行停产整顿。汨罗市长兼市整顿农药生产领导小组组长唐镇球，明知整顿工作没有完全做好，在未经化工主管部门和农药质量检测部门验收认可的情况下，分别于1988年1月、4月多次“批示”，让市工商局给化学农药厂、化工农药厂、大众农药厂颁发新的营业执照，并批示发给湘北农药厂筹建执照。这些厂以及后来趁势自行恢复生产的5家农药厂均未按有关规定办理农药“登记证”和“准产证”，1988年继续生产假劣农药5773吨。
    1988年12月，由监察部牵头的联合调查组在汨罗抽查了两个农药厂的生产情况，发现问题严重：罗城农药厂生产的假劣农药占该厂当年总产量的60％；化学农药厂的产品中假药813.7吨，劣药628.6吨。为此，联合调查组要求汨罗市政府派人对其它农药厂进行检查，但市长唐镇球态度不坚决，措施不得力，没有查清假劣农药的问题。
    鉴于唐镇球在汨罗市生产、销售、查禁假劣农药问题上严重失职、渎职，湖南省人民政府决定，给予唐镇球撤销市长职务的行政处分，并移送司法机关追究刑事责任。汨罗市政府对该市其他责任人进行了相应的政纪处理。另外，汨罗市有关机关已收审了8名制造销售假劣农药的厂长和不法分子，并给予了罚款、没收非法所得等处罚。
