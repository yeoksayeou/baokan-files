With a heavy heart and a desperate plea to save the destroyed farmland, he came to the unfamiliar city of Beijing, running between the National Land Management Bureau and various news agencies in the capital.

His name is Li Dechang, a farmer from Douzhuang Village, Xinanmen Town, Dangshan County, Anhui Province. On May 17, this elderly farmer, his hair turned white with age, spoke to reporters with tears in his eyes, "Save our village's land, it is the lifeblood of farmers." He recounted the events with deep concern.

In May 1985, after the State Council issued the "Regulations on the Management of Land for Village and Town Construction" and the "Regulations on the Acquisition of Land for State Construction," the officials of Douzhuang Village in Dangshan County seized 126 mu of farmland without any procedures, building a large brick kiln with more than 20 furnaces.

Douzhuang Village, with over 400 people, originally had only about 600 mu of farmland. Once the kiln was built, the land became even scarcer. Li Dechang could not tolerate such lawless behavior and began a long journey of appeals, pleading everywhere for the "demolition of the kiln and return of the land."

However, while Li Dechang was filing complaints, a few people in Douzhuang Village continued to illegally occupy land, becoming bolder and bolder.

In May 1988, while the old kiln had not been demolished, two new kilns were built. Under the direction of the village officials, another 100 mu of land was destroyed. At this time, the "Land Management Law of the People's Republic of China" had been in effect for over a year.

Despite the Dangshan County Land Management Bureau receiving reports from Li Dechang and others, repeatedly calling the Xinanmen Town to stop the construction of new kilns, and despite the bureau's staff repeatedly going to the construction site to persuade and explain the consequences, the land destroyers in Douzhuang Village paid no heed and continued their work.

To save the destroyed land, Li Dechang and his wife Xu Suzhen traveled to the county and province, enduring hardships and appealing for justice. He even sold his family's cows, pigs, sheep, and even hens that were laying eggs.

To prevent Li Dechang from appealing, some of the land destroyers once beat up this elderly "land guardian."

Several news agencies have exposed this serious case of illegal land seizure. In November 1988, the county party committee's newspaper, "Dawn News," published Li Dechang's letter. On March 23, 1989, "Economic News" published a reporter's investigation report titled "Why is the Land Law ineffective here?" Twenty days later, "Anhui Daily" prominently reprinted this investigation report with an editor's note. On April 30, 1989, "China Land News" also published an article titled "Those who deliberately do not enforce the Land Management Law should not be indulged."

Unfortunately, the media's supervision seemed to have no effect on the land destroyers, with some even publicly saying, "Let them keep publishing, we'll do what we want!"

In January of this year, the Dangshan County Land Bureau issued three documents in succession, requiring Douzhuang Village to stop production and stop building new kilns, but no one complied.

Also in early this year, led by the Dangshan County People's Congress Standing Committee, a joint investigation team was formed, including the county's Land Management Bureau, Forestry Bureau, Agriculture Bureau, Water Conservancy Bureau, and Township Enterprise Committee. After an on-site investigation, they confirmed that Douzhuang Village's illegal land seizure not only violated the Land Law but also violated the Forest Law (building kilns destroyed hundreds of trees), damaged farmland water sources, and agricultural production.

Based on this, on April 8, 1989, the Dangshan County People's Government issued a "Notice on the Illegal Land Seizure and Stoppage of Production of Three Kilns in Douzhuang Village, Xinanmen Town." However, to this day, two months after the notice was issued, the three kilns are still operating.

Li Dechang anxiously and painfully told the reporter: I have been complaining for several years now, is there really no one who can stop this illegal activity?

Editor's Note: After hearing Li Dechang's account, we consecutively called the county magistrate and the responsible comrades of the Dangshan County Land Management Bureau. They all agreed that the situation Li reported was basically true. The magistrate explained two specific situations about Douzhuang Village: first, the village is located in the old course of the Yellow River, and second, the location of the brick kilns is several meters higher than the surrounding area.

During the phone call, the magistrate also told the reporter that considering the significant investment made by Douzhuang Village in building the kilns, the county allowed them to continue producing for a period after fines were imposed, with the kilns to be demolished and the land returned by the end of 1990.

The relevant land management departments believe that while acknowledging that Douzhuang Village's illegal land seizure is a violation of the law, they also tacitly allow this illegal activity to continue, which is incorrect.

If officials and the masses have a weak understanding of the Land Law, there will be phenomena of violating the Land Law, ultimately leading to the bitter fruit of farmland being continuously illegally seized.

When this case will be resolved, people are waiting to see.

### “救救俺村的土地吧！”——砀山县豆寨村农民李德昌的诉说

    “救救俺村的土地吧！”
    ——砀山县豆寨村农民李德昌的诉说
    陈秋中
    带着辛酸，带着被毁耕地的呼救，他来到了陌生的北京，奔走于国家土地管理局和首都多家新闻单位之间。
    他叫李德昌，是安徽省砀山县西南门镇豆寨村农民。5月17日，这位头发花白、年过花甲的老农民见到记者时，声泪俱下地说：“救救俺村的土地吧，土地是俺农民的命根子。”他怀着深深的忧虑，诉说了事情的原委。
    1985年5月，国务院发布《村镇建房用地管理条例》和《国家建设征用土地条例》以后，砀山县豆寨村的干部却不办理任何手续，滥占耕地126亩，建起了一座20多门的烧砖瓦大轮窑。
    400多人的豆寨村，原来仅有600多亩耕地，一建窑，地就更少了。李德昌容不得这种无法无天的行为，开始了漫长的上访历程，四处哀告，请求“拆窑还地！”
    可是，就在李德昌告状的同时，豆寨村少数人依旧有恃无恐地违法占地，而且胆子越来越大。
    1988年5月，这里旧窑未拆，两座新窑又起，在村干部的指挥下，村里又毁地100多亩。而此时，《中华人民共和国土地管理法》已颁布实施了一年有余。
    尽管县土地管理局在接到李德昌等人的报告后，多次打电话给西南门镇，要求停建新窑，尽管土地管理局的同志多次到建窑现场进行劝阻，陈述利害关系，但豆寨村的毁地者置若罔闻，照干不误。
    为了挽救被毁的土地，李德昌和老伴许素真赴县进省，风餐露宿，上访告状。他还卖掉了家中的牛、猪、羊，甚至正在下蛋的鸡。
    为了阻止李德昌上访，一些毁地者曾毒打这位年迈的“土地卫士”。
    对这一起严重的滥占耕地事件，多家新闻单位先后予以揭露。1988年11月，宿县地委机关报《拂晓报》刊登了李德昌的来信。1989年3月23日，《经济新闻报》刊登了记者的调查报告《〈土地法〉为何在这里不灵？》。20天之后，《安徽日报》在显著位置转载了这篇调查报告并加了编者按。1989年4月30日，《中国土地报》也刊出了反映这一问题的文章《对蓄意不执行〈土地管理法〉者不应姑息》。
    可叹的是，新闻舆论的监督，似乎对毁地者毫无触动，有的人甚至公开说：“他们有劲让他们天天去登，我们干我们的！”
    今年元月，砀山县土地局连续下发了三个文件，要求豆寨村停止生产、停建新窑，但没人执行。
    也是在今年初，由砀山县人大常委会牵头，成立了有县土地管理局、林业局、农业局、水利局、乡镇企业委员会参加的联合调查组。实地调查之后，他们确认，豆寨村滥占耕地不仅违犯了《土地法》，而且违犯了《森林法》（建窑毁树数百株），破坏了农田水源和农业生产。
    据此，1989年4月8日，砀山县人民政府下发了《关于西南门镇豆寨村三座轮窑违法占地停产待处理的通知》。可是，时至今日，离下文时间已经两个月了，三座窑场依旧升火烧砖。
    李德昌焦急而又痛心地对记者说：我已经告了几年了，难道这种违法的事就没人能管吗？
    编者附记：听过李德昌的诉说后，我们相继与砀山县县长、县土地管理局负责同志通了长途电话。他们都认为李反映的情况基本属实。县长说明了豆寨村的两点具体情况：一是该村地处黄河故道，二是砖窑所在地比周围地高出数米。
    在电话中，县长还告诉记者，考虑到豆寨村建窑时投资较多，因此在罚款之后，允许他们继续取土生产一段时间，到1990年底拆窑还地。
    有关土地管理部门则认为，一面确认豆寨村滥占耕地属于违法行为，另一面又默认这种违法行为可以继续进行下去，这种态度是不对的。
    既然干部与群众土地法观念淡薄，就会有违反土地法的现象，最后必然结出耕地不断被滥占的苦果。
    此案何时了结，人们拭目以待。
