    EEC Countries to Ban High-Noise Aircraft Landings
    African Aviation in Crisis

    ABIDJAN, July 14 (Xinhua) — According to a recent report by the local newspaper "L'Aube," due to an International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) decision to ban high-noise aircraft from landing in EEC countries, which will soon come into effect, the majority of aircraft operated by African airlines will be barred from landing at West European airports.

    The decision was made by ICAO in 1980. Due to opposition from African countries and the African Civil Aviation Commission's arguments, the effective date was postponed to January 1, 1990. The first batch of aircraft to be banned includes the Boeing 707, DC-8, DC-9 (first generation), and the earliest models of the Boeing 727 and 737. Out of the more than 300 aircraft used by African countries, two-thirds belong to these models. According to the decision, starting from 1993, DC-10 and the first-generation Boeing 747 will also be included in the ban. By then, there will be very few African aircraft allowed to land in Western Europe.

    This decision has already plunged African civil aviation into a crisis. Re-equipping their fleets and replacing outdated engines will require at least $20 billion in funds. This is an impossible task for African countries that are facing increasing economic difficulties.

    To overcome this challenge, African aviation ministers held a two-day meeting in Yamoussoukro, the political capital of Côte d'Ivoire, last October. They proposed strengthening regional cooperation and unity. Since then, Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia in West Africa have formed the Mano Air Company, North African countries have established the Maghreb Air Company, and East African and Central African countries have signed agreements for cooperation in civil aviation. The African Development Bank will also provide assistance in this area.

### 欧共体国家将禁止高噪声飞机着陆  非洲民航陷入困境

    欧共体国家将禁止高噪声飞机着陆
    非洲民航陷入困境
    本报阿比让7月14日电  记者杨汝生报道：据此地《博爱晨报》最近报道，由于国际民用航空组织的一项禁止高噪声飞机在欧共体国家着陆的决定不久就要生效，非洲国家航空公司的绝大多数飞机将被西欧国家的机场拒之门外。
    这项决定是该组织1980年通过的。由于非洲国家的反对和非洲民用航空组织的据理力争，其生效期才推迟到1990年的1月1日。首批被禁止的飞机型号是波音707、DC8、DC9（第一代）以及最早生产的波音727、737。非洲国家使用的300余架飞机中的2／3属于这些型号。根据这项决定，自1993年起，DC10和波音747（第一代）也将进入禁止之列。届时，非洲国家的飞机能在西欧降落的已所剩无几了。
    此项决定已使非洲民用航空事业陷入困境。重新装备自己的机群和更换过时的发动机，至少需要200亿美元的资金。这对经济日益困难的非洲国家来说是不可能做到的。
    为了渡过难关，非洲国家的民用航空部长于去年10月在科特迪瓦政治首都亚穆苏克罗举行了两天的会议，提出加强地区合作与联合的倡议。自那以后，西非的几内亚、塞拉利昂和利比里亚三国组成了马诺航空公司，北非国家成立了马格里布航空公司，东非国家和中非国家也签署了在民用航空方面联合的协议。非洲开发银行也将在这方面给予资助。
