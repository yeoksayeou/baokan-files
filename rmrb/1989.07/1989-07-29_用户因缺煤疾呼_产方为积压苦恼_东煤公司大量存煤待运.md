In a situation where coal is generally in short supply nationwide, the Northeast Inner Mongolia Coal Industry Corporation is facing the opposite problem: an excess of stored coal. By the beginning of July, the 19 mining bureaus under this corporation had accumulated 48.6 million tons of coal, equivalent to the annual output of a large mining area.

According to the Ministry of Energy, the Northeast Inner Mongolia Coal Industry Corporation is responsible for one-quarter of the country's coal production. This year, the corporation's million workers have worked tirelessly, leading to a significant increase in coal production. The monthly coal output in May and June set a new record for the highest monthly production since the corporation's establishment six years ago. Unfortunately, due to severe shortages in transportation capacity, the more coal produced, the more coal is stored, leading to an abnormal situation. Just in the four major mining bureaus of Heilongjiang—Jixi, Qitaihe, Hegang, and Shuangyashan—the stored coal has reached over 30.9 million tons. As the temperature continues to rise, there have been over 30 incidents of spontaneous combustion and fires in the stored coal, burning nearly 500,000 tons of coal and causing direct economic losses of 2.45 million yuan. The accumulated coal has resulted in idle funds amounting to over 300 million yuan, making the financial situation of the mines even more tense.

    用户因缺煤疾呼　产方为积压苦恼
    东煤公司大量存煤待运
    新华社北京7月29日电  （记者赵明亮）在全国煤炭普遍告紧的情况下，东北内蒙古煤炭工业联合公司却因存煤过多而苦恼。截至7月上旬，这个公司19个矿务局的存煤多达486万多吨，相当于一个大型矿区全年的煤炭产量。
    据能源部介绍，东北内蒙古煤炭工业联合公司担负着全国1／4的煤炭产量。今年以来，全公司的百万矿工努力奋斗，促使煤炭产量大幅度上升，5、6月份原煤产量创公司成立6年来月产量最高纪录。但遗憾的是，由于运力严重不足，造成出煤越多、存煤越多的反常现象。仅据黑龙江的鸡西、七台河、鹤岗和双鸭山四大矿务局统计，存煤已达309万多吨。而且随着气温不断升高，已发生存煤自燃发火30多次，烧掉原煤近5万吨，直接经济损失245万元。这些积压的煤炭造成的死滞资金高达3亿多元，使各矿资金更加紧张。
