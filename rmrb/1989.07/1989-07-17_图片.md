    The director of the 16th Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Railways, Zhong Yibiao, has placed great emphasis on supporting the upgrading of enterprise archives management. In the bureau, 6 units have been established with archives, and all have been recognized as advanced enterprises in archives management at the provincial and municipal levels. Among them, the headquarters, and the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Engineering Divisions have been the first in the national railway construction system to be promoted to the second level of national archives management. The completion documents for the first phase of the Daqin Railway were handed over and were praised by the Ministry of Railways and the Beijing Railway Bureau Archives Office as being of the highest standard in the entire railway system. By fully utilizing archives, economic losses were reduced by 370,000 yuan, and economic benefits of nearly one million yuan were created.
