    Menem Sworn In as Argentine President, Calls for Joint Efforts to Save the Nation
    Buenos Aires, July 8 (Xinhua) — Argentine Republic's 42nd President Saúl Menem was sworn in this morning. This is the first time since 1952 that a democratically elected president has succeeded another. The 32 million people of Argentina are celebrating the smooth continuation of the democratic system while hoping that the new government will take decisive measures to help the country out of its most severe economic and social crisis in history. The new president called on the people to join forces to save and revive the nation.

    Before Menem was sworn in, the National Congress formally accepted the resignation of outgoing President Raúl Alfonsín. Alfonsín decided to end his term five months early due to his inability to resolve the economic and social crisis. Therefore, Menem began his presidency during a critical period. This year, cumulative inflation has reached 613%, the treasury is empty, unable to repay foreign and domestic debts, with overdue foreign debt interest amounting to $4.5 billion. Foreign banks and international financial organizations have stopped lending to Argentina, and the country's foreign exchange reserves are only enough to cover 15 days of imports. Rapidly rising inflation has quickly eroded wage purchasing power, causing production to stagnate, with about 4 million people living in poverty, and social unrest breaking out in some major cities. The socio-economic situation is extremely dire.

    In his inaugural address to Congress, Menem called on all Argentines, regardless of party affiliation, to join forces to save the nation. He said that the new government will not perform magic to change the situation, and the only thing it can offer the people is three words: sacrifice, work, and hope. The new president announced that he will implement extremely strict economic adjustment measures.

    As the president of the Justice Party, Menem included some non-partisan figures, businessmen, and economists in his cabinet. The government's goal is to seek a social contract involving all sectors of society to cope with the current crisis.

    Regarding foreign policy, Menem emphasized that Argentina will develop relations with other countries regardless of ideology, strictly adhering to the principles of independence, self-reliance, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.

    Representatives from 77 countries, including China's special envoy Qi Yuanjing, attended today's inauguration ceremony.

    梅内姆宣誓就任阿总统呼吁共同努力拯救国家
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯7月8日电　记者李志明报道：阿根廷共和国第42任总统萨乌尔·梅内姆今天上午宣誓就职。这是1952年以来，第一次一位民选总统接替另一位民选总统。3200万阿根廷人民在庆祝民主体制顺利延续的同时，期待着新政府采取果断有力的措施使这个南美国家摆脱历史上最严重的经济社会危机。新总统呼吁人民共同努力拯救、复兴国家。
    今天，在梅内姆总统宣誓就职之前，国会首先正式接受了离任总统阿方辛的辞呈。阿方辛是在无力解决经济社会危机之后决定提前5个月结束任期的。因此，梅内姆开始执政时，国家正经历着一个非常时期。今年以来，通货膨胀累计达613％，国库空虚，无力偿还外债、内债，拖欠外债利息已达45亿美元，外国银行和国际金融组织均停止给阿新贷款，而国家外汇储备仅够支付15天的进口。急剧上升的通货膨胀迅速吞噬工资实际购买力，同时使生产停滞，约400万人处于贫困状态，一些大城市爆发了社会动乱。社会经济形势十分严峻。
    梅内姆总统在议会发表的就职演说中，号召全体阿根廷人民不分党派共同努力以拯救国家。他说，新政府不会施魔法来改变形势，唯一能够奉献给人民的是三个词：牺牲、工作和希望。新总统宣布将实行非常严厉的经济调整措施。
    作为正义党总统，梅内姆在组阁时吸收了一些党外人士、企业家、经济学家参加政府。政府的目的是寻求一个社会各阶层都参加的社会契约，以应付当前的危机。
    关于外交政策，梅内姆强调将不分意识形态地发展对外关系，严守独立自主、不干涉别国内政的原则。
    包括中国政府特使戚元靖在内的77个国家的代表出席了今天的就职仪式。
