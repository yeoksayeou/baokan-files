Zhuhai's Development Blueprint Welcomes Surge in Foreign Investment

According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhuhai, July 16th — (Reporter Zhang Yusheng) Mayor Liang Guodai recently accepted an interview from Hong Kong and Macau journalists, saying that Zhuhai's current situation is very good. This not only reflects the achievements of China's reform and opening up but also further proves that the policy of reform and opening up is correct and is the path to national strength. He predicted that the wave of foreign investment in Zhuhai will soon arrive, and Zhuhai's economic construction will have greater development.

Liang Guodai said that although a counter-revolutionary riot occurred in Beijing this year, and the situation across the country is severe, Zhuhai has not seen phenomena such as strikes, work stoppages, market closures, looting, or bank runs. Society is stable, production and work are running normally, and the economy has remained relatively stable. Compared to the same period last year, industrial output value increased by 77.1%, retail sales of social commodities increased by 9.8%, fiscal revenue increased by 59%, bank deposits increased by 7.5%, and urban and rural residents' savings increased by 20%. The total number of tourists received has decreased, but the number of foreign tourists and overseas Chinese received is the same as last year. He introduced that in terms of introducing foreign capital, 21 contracts were signed in the first half of the year, an increase of 60%, the total investment agreed upon increased by 60%, and actual utilization of foreign capital increased by 68%. In June, 81 investment contracts and letters of intent were signed with foreigners, plus "three comes one compensation" and other projects, with an investment amount of more than $32 million. In addition, projects such as shipbuilding bases, petrochemical bases, and 600,000-kilowatt power plants are being negotiated. Many multinational corporations, conglomerates, and Taiwanese businessmen continue to flock in.

Liang Guodai said that to welcome the arrival of the reform and opening up high tide, Zhuhai is thinking about and planning the future development prospects. It is planned to build large ports and energy, raw material, chemical bases, as well as high-speed roads in the western region of Zhuhai. Railway engineering is also being planned. It is planned to build large warehousing areas, bonded areas, and supply areas on the islands adjacent to Hong Kong and Macau in the eastern region of Zhuhai, and to build large petrochemical and shipbuilding bases. Some projects have already started implementation. He said that many foreign investors have come to inspect and negotiate investments, and the development prospects are very promising.

    珠海规划发展蓝图迎接外商投资高潮
    据新华社珠海7月16日电　（记者张愈升）珠海市市长梁广大日前接受港澳记者采访时说，珠海当前整个形势很好，这不但反映了我国改革开放的成就，而且进一步证明改革开放的政策是正确的，是强国之路。他预言外商在珠海投资的高潮必将很快到来，珠海的经济建设将有一个更大的发展。
    梁广大说，今年上半年，虽然北京发生了反革命暴乱，全国出现严峻的形势，但珠海没有出现罢课、罢工、罢市、抢购、挤提钱款等现象，社会安定，生产、工作运转正常，经济一直比较稳定。与去年同期相比，工业产值增长77.1％，社会商品零售额增长9.8％，财政收入增长59％，银行存款额增长7.5％，城乡居民储蓄增长20％。接待旅游客人总数虽然减少，但接待外国旅客和华侨与去年持平。他介绍说，在引进外资方面，上半年共签订合同21项，增长60％，协议投资总额增长60％，实际利用外资增长68％。6月份与外商签订投资合同、意向书81项，加之“三来一补”等项目，投资额达3200多万美元。另外，造船基地、石油化工基地，60万千瓦电厂等项目正在洽谈。一些跨国公司、财团及台商依然纷至沓来。
    梁广大说，珠海为了迎接改革开放高潮的到来，正在思考和规划未来的发展前景。现已计划在珠海西部地区兴建大型港口和能源、原材料、化工基地以及高速马路。铁路工程也正在规划。珠海东部地区计划把紧靠港澳的岛屿建成大型的仓储区、保税区和补给区，建成大型的石化、造船基地，有的项目已开始付诸实施。他说，已有不少外商前来考察和洽谈投资，发展前景十分美好。
