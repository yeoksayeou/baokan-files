Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th.

CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin today met in Zhongnanhai with Ma Wan-qi, Tang Xiangqian, and other Hong Kong and Macau figures who came to Beijing to attend the eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress and the seventh session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference.

At the meeting, Jiang Zemin reiterated that China's policies and principles towards Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, formulated on the basis of "one country, two systems," will not change.

Jiang Zemin briefed the guests on the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. He said that the lessons from this incident are clear: for many years, the Four Cardinal Principles have not been consistently upheld, leading to the spread of bourgeois liberalization. For some time, there has been little talk of socialism and communism, and even patriotism has been rarely mentioned. Some people have even lost the most basic sense of national dignity.

Jiang Zemin said: In the future, we must strengthen political and ideological education and address erroneous trends in their infancy. He expressed that the Party and the government are determined to solve existing problems, eliminate corruption, overcome unfair distribution, and boost the economy.

He hoped that all friends and the people of the entire nation would work together to revitalize China and prosper Hong Kong and Macau.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Hab Comin, Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office Ji Pengfei, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Wang Renhe, and Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Director of the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee Yan Mingfu attended the meeting.

    江泽民会见马万祺等朋友
    重申对港澳台方针政策不变
    党和政府有决心消除腐败克服分配不公把经济搞上去
    新华社北京7月7日电  中共中央总书记江泽民今天在中南海会见了来京参加七届全国人大常委会第八次会议和七届全国政协常委会第七次会议的马万祺、唐翔千等港澳人士。
    会见时，江泽民重申中国按照“一国两制”的原则制定的对香港、澳门和台湾的方针、政策不会改变。
    江泽民向客人介绍了最近内地发生的学潮、动乱和北京平息反革命暴乱的情况。他在谈到这次事件的教训时说，多年来，由于没有一贯坚持四项基本原则，导致资产阶级自由化蔓延。一段时间以来，不但很少讲社会主义、共产主义，连爱国主义也讲得很少，有些人连起码的民族气节也丧失了。
    江泽民说：今后，我们要加强政治思想教育，对错误思潮要在其萌芽状态时就加以解决。他表示，党和政府有决心解决存在的问题，消除腐败，克服分配不公，同时要把经济搞上去。
    他希望各位朋友和全国人民一道，齐心协力，为振兴中华、繁荣港澳作出努力。
    全国人大常委会副委员长习仲勋，国务院港澳办主任姬鹏飞，全国政协副主席王任重和全国政协副主席、中共中央统战部部长阎明复等参加了会见。
