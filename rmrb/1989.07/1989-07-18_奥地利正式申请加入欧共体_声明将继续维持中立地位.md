People's Daily, Brussels, July 18th. Correspondent Wei Wei reports: On July 17th, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock handed over Austria's application to join the European Community to the current chairman of the Council of Ministers of the European Community, French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas.

The Austrian government stated in the application that after joining the European Community, "Austria will be able to fulfill the legal obligations of a member state and continue to implement a neutral policy that makes a special contribution to maintaining European peace and security."

That afternoon, at the General Affairs Council of the European Community, 11 member states agreed to immediately begin the review process for Austria's application. However, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens suggested that the European Community should arrange a "thinking period" to study the political issues arising from Austria's membership.

The Austrian National Council passed a constitutional law in 1955 declaring Austria's permanent neutrality. While applying to join the European Community, Austria declared that it would continue to maintain its neutral position. Belgium believes that Austria's neutral status is incompatible with the European Community's goal of establishing a European political union, and therefore advocates caution.

Austria has close relations with the member states of the European Community. Two-thirds of its foreign trade exports go to the European Community. According to statistics from the European Community, in 1988, Austria exported 167 million European Currency Units to the European Community and imported 224 million European Currency Units from the European Community. One of the reasons for Austria's application to join the European Community is the fear that its interests will be harmed after the completion of the European Community's single market.

The European Community has already declared that it will not accept new members before the completion of the single market in 1992. Therefore, even if Austria can become the 13th member state of the European Community, it will be a matter for the 1990s.

### 奥地利正式申请加入欧共体  声明将继续维持中立地位

    奥地利正式申请加入欧共体
    声明将继续维持中立地位
    本报布鲁塞尔7月18日电  记者魏崴报道：17日奥地利外交部长阿洛伊斯·莫克在这里向欧共体部长理事会现任主席、法国外长迪马递交了奥地利要求加入欧共体的申请书。
    奥政府在申请书中表示，奥加入欧共体后，“将能履行一个成员国的法律义务，并继续执行对维护欧洲和平与安全作出特别贡献的中立政策。”
    当日下午，在欧共体总务理事会上，11个成员国赞成就奥地利的申请立即开始审查程序，但是比利时外交大臣伊斯更斯建议欧共体应安排一个“思考时期”，以研究奥的加入所带来的政治问题。
    奥地利国民议会曾于1955年通过一宪法性法律，宣布奥永久中立，奥申请加入欧共体的同时，声明仍将继续维持其中立地位。比利时认为奥的中立地位与欧共体建立欧洲政治联盟的目的是不相容的，所以主张谨慎从事。
    奥地利与欧共体诸国关系密切。它的2／3的外贸出口是向欧共体的。据欧共体统计，1988年奥向欧共体的出口1670万欧洲货币单位，从欧共体进口达2240万欧洲货币单位。奥申请加入欧共体的原因之一是害怕欧共体大市场建成后，自己的利益受到损害。
    欧共体早已声明，在1992年大市场建成前，不接纳新成员。因此，即使奥地利能够成为第13个欧共体成员国，也是90年代的事。
