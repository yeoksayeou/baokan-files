	The Tree Brace
	Fang Xiangdong

	Born in splendor, dying in decay, both humans and trees follow this cycle.

	When I first arrived at the "Green Treasury" to work in the countryside, the old village secretary led me and a few comrades up the mountain to enjoy the fresh air, pick chestnuts, dig bamboo shoots, and gather wildflowers. The mountain was densely covered with trees, the air was damp, and the wild beauty was intoxicating. On the mountain, I discovered a strange phenomenon: every sturdy, straight pine tree had a large vine wrapped tightly around its trunk.

	What was the meaning of this? I asked the old village secretary, Zhang Rongsheng.

	The old secretary replied, "This is an old custom passed down through generations here. Whenever a family has a child, they go up the mountain to find a good tree, ask a geomancer to bless it, and then wrap a vine around it. This tree will be the child's coffin tree when they die."

	People start preparing for death as soon as they are born. At that time, I didn't think much about it, as it seemed like a natural thing. The old secretary, however, punched a large, vine-wrapped tree with his fist and sighed, "What a pity! Ah, what a pity..."

	While I was in the countryside, I heard that a young person from another village had chopped down a vine-wrapped tree before being transferred back to the city. As a result, the villagers broke his legs!

	The vine brace was indeed tightly wrapped.

	The reason the old secretary was called the "old secretary" was not just because of his age, but also because he was the first village secretary after liberation. He had been removed from his position because he refused to allow trees to be cut down for steel production. But what good did it do? Not to mention ordinary pine trees, even the "pine king" trees, which had grown for hundreds of years and had a trunk diameter of over a meter, were mostly doomed! Zhang Rongsheng cried. He sat on the felled tree, smoking his pipe and shedding tears like a wronged child. Later, the township asked him to come out and be the secretary again, but he refused, insisting on being a forest ranger until his death. After all, a forest ranger only needs to look after the forests within his jurisdiction, which is not a bad job. However, the old secretary could not sit still. He loved planting trees, and many barren hills were planted with new saplings. A few years later, our "Green Treasury" was named a national advanced unit for forest protection, and Chairman Zhou wrote in his own handwriting: "Evergreen mountains, sustainable use." It should be said that the old secretary had made great contributions.

	In 1979, I was transferred back to the city. That year, Old Zhang was elected as a county people's congress representative. At the meeting, he talked about nothing but trees, or in a more modern way, forest protection. Later, he died. Before his death, he made a request to the township head: he did not want the tree that his parents had wrapped for him, but only asked the township to send a car to take his body to the county for cremation, and then bury his ashes under the tree that was wrapped when he was born, to fertilize the tree.

	This action was not understood by many villagers, and some even said that the tree he buried his ashes under was a "ghost tree."

	At that time, the county was carrying out forest protection activities. Residents of the county who burned firewood were all changed to burning coal, with irregular inspections. If caught burning firewood, they would be heavily fined! The newly appointed county magistrate was moved by Old Zhang's last wish and issued two orders: one was to ask the township to erect a monument for Old Secretary Zhang (this monument was a bit out of place. From the front, it looked like a martyr's tomb, with "Zhang Rongsheng's Tomb" written on it; from the back, it looked like a propaganda board, with "Love and Protect Trees, Everyone's Responsibility" carved on it). The second was that from then on, the deceased in the suburbs of various townships would not use coffin trees, but the government would provide cars and money to send them to the crematorium for cremation. If they were secretly buried, they would be dug up. This measure seemed a bit extreme and had indeed dug up a few coffins. At first, some people cursed, but gradually they got used to it. After a few years of habituation, the county added a crematorium and arranged for a few more people to be employed.

	Recently, I returned to my "second hometown" and discovered a major change, which made me very happy: in the past, whenever a child was born in the village, a grand feast would be held for the whole village on the full moon day, and then the whole village would widen the original village road, meaning "a wide road leads to officialdom," implying that this newborn might also become an official. Now, there is a cement road leading to the village, and perhaps because there is no road to widen, this custom has also been "reformed." The feast is still necessary, but after the meal, instead of widening the road, they plant trees. The whole village plants one pine tree per person. If it is not the tree-planting season? That's fine, drink the wine first and plant the tree later. The mountain people are simple and never break their promises.

	I asked the villagers: "Don't wrap the trees anymore?"

	They replied: "No, we don't."

    树箍
    房向东
    生而荣死而枯，人和树都是如此。
    我刚刚到“绿色金库”插队时，老支书当向导，和几个伙伴们到山上玩新鲜，拣榛，挖笋，采野花。那山，密匝匝的树，空气湿漉漉，野趣盎然，好不醉人。在山上，我发现了一个怪现象，凡是长得粗壮、笔挺的杉木树身上必有一根吃进皮里的大藤箍着。
    这是怎么回事呢？我问老支书章荣生。
    老支书答说：这是我们这里世世代代的老习惯了。哪家生了孩子，就到山上找一株好树，请风水先生看看，行了，箍上一条藤，这树便是孩子死后的寿木了。
    人一生下来就筹备死。当时，我也没有多想什么，似乎这是顺理成章的事。老支书却用拳头在一株好大的上了箍的树上擂了一拳，叹曰：“可惜！唉，可惜可惜……”
    在乡下时，我听说有一位别村的知青，上调前砍了一株上箍的树，结果被村民们打断了腿！
    这树箍，还箍得真紧啊。
    老支书之所以被称为“老支书”，不只是年纪大的意思，还因为他是解放后第一任村支书。他曾被免了职，原因是不让砍树炼钢铁。不让又有什么用呢？不要讲一般的杉木，即便长了几百年、胸径足有1米宽的“杉木王”，也多是在劫难逃！章荣生哭了，他坐在被砍倒的树上，边“叭哒”着旱烟边流泪，像受了大委屈的小孩子。后来，乡里又请他出来当支书，他不干了，就是要当护林员，一直当到死。本来嘛，护林员看看管辖范围内的森林即可，也不失为美差。然而，老支书却闲不住，爱种树，很多荒山都被插上了新苗。几年后，我们“绿色金库”被评为全国保护森林的先进单位，周总理亲笔题字：“青山常在，永续利用”。应该说，其间，老支书是立了汗马功劳的。
    1979年我上调回城。那年，老章被选上了县人大代表。在会上，他讲来讲去，讲的都是木头，洋一点说，就是保护森林。后来，他死了。死前他对乡长提了一个要求，他不用父母为他箍的那株树，只求乡里派车把遗体送到县里火化算了，骨灰吆，埋在他出生时箍的那株树下，肥树。
    这一举动，村人多不理解，有的人还说他埋骨灰的那株树是“鬼树”。
    是时，该县正在开展保护森林的活动，县城居民烧柴的，一律改为烧煤，不定期检查，要是烧柴而被查到，重罚！新上任的县长听了老章的遗愿，大为感动，下了两道命令：一是请乡里为老支书立个碑（这碑有点不伦不类。正面看，像烈士墓碑，上面写着“章荣生之墓”；后面看，像一块宣传栏，刻着“爱护树木，人人有责”。）二是以后郊区各乡死人，一律不用寿木，由公家出车出钱，送到火葬场火化。如果偷偷埋下的也要挖起。这一措施似乎偏激了一点，也曾真的挖起了几口棺材。开头也有人骂，慢慢也就习惯了，习惯成自然，施行三五年，该县新添了一家火葬场，也多安排了几个人就业。
    最近，我又回了一趟“第二故乡”，发现了一个大变化，十分欣喜：先前，村里凡生了孩子的，满月时必定要宴请全村人大吃一餐，然后全村人都去把原有的村路开大一些，意思是“路大好出仕”，意味着这新生儿没准也能当上“父母官”。现在，已有水泥马路通到村里，大约是由于无路可开了吧，这一风俗也进行了“改革”，宴请一餐是少不了的，但吃罢不是开路，改为种树。全村人一人种一株杉木。如果不是种树时节呢？那好办，酒先喝，到时补树。山里人纯朴，绝不食言。
    我问乡亲：不箍树了?？
    答曰：不箍了。
