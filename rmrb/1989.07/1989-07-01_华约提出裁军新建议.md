	Warsaw Pact Proposes New Disarmament Suggestions

	Xinhua News Agency, Vienna, June 29th — The Warsaw Pact today proposed a new suggestion regarding the division of European disarmament regions during the European conventional arms negotiations in Vienna.

	The suggestion, proposed by the Czechoslovakian delegation on behalf of the Warsaw Pact, divides the European disarmament regions into four areas: Central Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, and the Rear Area. The Central European region includes the Baltic Military District, the Carpathian Military District, and the Belarus Military District in the western part of the Soviet Union. France and the United Kingdom are also included in the Central European region.

	The NATO side has repeatedly demanded that the above three military districts in the western part of the Soviet Union be included in the Central European disarmament region. The Warsaw Pact's new suggestion is obviously a concession to NATO's demands. In exchange, the Warsaw Pact side demands that NATO make concessions on the issue of reducing stored equipment. NATO has so far refused to include the reduction of stored equipment in the negotiations.

	It is reported that the Warsaw Pact's new suggestion also proposed the maximum limits of armaments in each region.

    华约提出裁军新建议
    新华社维也纳6月29日电　华沙条约组织今天在维也纳欧洲常规军备谈判中提出一项关于划分欧洲裁军区域的新建议。
    由捷克斯洛伐克代表团代表华约提出的这项建议把欧洲裁军区域划分为中欧、北欧、南欧和后方区4个区域，其中的中欧区域包括苏联西部的波罗的海沿岸军区、喀尔巴阡军区和白俄罗斯军区。法国和英国也划入中欧区域。
    北约方面一再要求把苏联西部的上述3个军区划入中欧裁军区域，华约的新建议显然是对北约要求作出了让步。作为交换条件，华约方面要求北约在裁减库存装备问题上作出让步。北约迄今拒绝把裁减库存装备纳入谈判。
    据透露，华约新建议还提出了各个区域军备的最高限额。
