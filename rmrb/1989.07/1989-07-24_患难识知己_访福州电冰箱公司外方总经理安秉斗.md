In the days when the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing spread to some of our cities and caused unrest in many places, many foreign businessmen who run enterprises in China stayed at their posts. An Bingdou, the foreign director of the Fujian Refrigerator Company, is one of them.

The energetic An Bingdou is dressed in a light blue short-sleeved shirt like a worker, with a pair of glasses on his tanned face, and a serious and confident expression. When talking about the recent events, Mr. An remained calm. "I am not without any concerns," he said. "My family called several times a day, and the company I am in also called frequently to inquire about the situation. Some foreign businessmen in Fujian have left. I am aware of these situations. However, I believe that China's reform and opening-up policy will not be easily changed. I think the Chinese government is a strong government that can manage the country well. This has been proven by the increasingly stable social order."

After the translator finished translating this passage, he added: "There is a Chinese saying, 'Trials reveal true friends.' When a friend is in trouble, leaving is not being a true friend. A true friend is someone who shares the difficulties when a friend is in trouble. It is for these reasons that I decided to stay and carry out normal work, completing daily business."

The reporter wanted to delve into Mr. An's thoughts, why he was so confident in China's reform and opening-up policy?

"I was attracted by China's reform and opening-up policy," said Mr. An, nodding to me with a smile, understanding the question I raised. He talked about the thoughts of his company, Daewoo Group, when it first contacted Fujian a few years ago. He believed that the development of the world economy requires countries to complement each other, optimizing the allocation of capital, technology, labor, and other production factors to stand firm in competition. In this context, China's reform and opening-up policy follows this global trend. Our Daewoo Company chose Fujian as a partner precisely because this place is one of the earliest regions in China to implement reform and opening-up. Moreover, China has introduced foreign advanced technology and capital to reform old enterprises, improving efficiency and living standards, and the people are satisfied. These are what I have seen with my own eyes. How can such a good policy change?"

Mr. An talked about the Fujian Refrigerator Company, which he manages. It was established in January 1987 with a joint investment of 12.55 million US dollars by Chinese and foreign parties. The product has 20% returned sales, and the annual output value can reach 450 million yuan. Since its official production on June 13 last year, it has produced more than 30,000 refrigerators. To ensure the quality of the "Queen" brand refrigerators, they destroyed some second-grade refrigerators, "For the 'Emperor' (customers), we smashed the unqualified 'Queen'." This became a popular saying in Fujian at the time.

Facing the new situation in the domestic and international markets, Mr. An said they are making efforts to create excellence and innovation, and open up the market. This year's plan to export 10,000 units can be completed, with 7,000 orders already in the first half of the year. To increase exports and earnings, and improve efficiency, the company is speeding up the process of nationalization. With a consistent open policy and support from all sides, Mr. An Bingdou is full of confidence in the future of the enterprise.

    患难识知己
    ——访福州电冰箱公司外方总经理安秉斗
    本报记者　张铭清
    在北京发生的反革命暴乱波及我国的一些城市、不少地方产生动乱的日子里，许多在我国办企业的外商坚守岗位。中外合资企业——福州电冰箱有限公司外方总经理安秉斗先生就是其中的一位。
    年富力强的安总穿着和工人一样的浅蓝色短袖衫，黝黑的脸上架着眼镜，严肃认真的表情透着自信、坚定和真诚。
    谈到前些日子发生的事情，安先生神态自若。“我也不是一点顾虑也没有，家里人一天几次电话，我所在的公司也不断来电问情况，福州也有些外商离开了。这些情况我是知道的。但是，我更相信，中国的改革开放政策是不会轻易改变的。我认为，中国政府是一个可以管理好国家的强有力的政府。这一点，已经为日趋稳定的社会秩序所证实。”
    等翻译把这段话译毕，他又补充道：中国有句话，叫做“患难识知己”。在朋友遇到困难的时候离开，不是真正的朋友。真正的朋友，是在朋友有困难的时候，分担他的困难。正是由于以上考虑，我才坚决留下来，开展正常工作，完成日常业务。
    记者想探究一下安先生的思想底蕴，他何以会对中国的改革开放政策深信不疑呢？
    “我是被中国的改革开放政策吸引来的。”安总经理微笑着向我点点头，对我提的问题表示理解。他谈到几年前，他所在的大宇集团公司开始和福建方面接触时的想法。他认为，世界经济的发展，要求国际间取长补短，使资金、技术、人力等诸生产要素得到最佳配置，才能在竞争中站稳脚跟。在这种情况下，中国的改革开放政策顺应了这一世界潮流，我们大宇公司把福建选为合作伙伴，正是因为这个地方是中国最早实行改革开放的地区之一。而且中国引进了外国的先进技术和资金改造老企业，提高了效益，改善了人民生活，人民也满意。这些，都是我亲眼看到的。这种好政策，怎么会改变呢？
    安总经理谈到，他管理的福州电冰箱有限公司是1987年1月由中外合资1255万美元兴建的，产品20％返销，年产值可达到4.5亿元。从去年6月13日正式投产以来，已生产电冰箱3万多台。为了确保“皇后”牌电冰箱的质量，他们把一些二等品冰箱砸毁，“为了‘皇帝’（顾客），砸了不合格‘皇后’”在福州成为流传一时的佳话。
    面临国内外市场的新形势，安先生说，他们正在进行创优创新，开拓市场的努力。今年出口一万台的计划可以完成，上半年已有7000台订单。为了多出口创汇，提高效益，公司正在加快推进国产化的工作，有一以贯之的开放政策，有各方面支持，安秉斗总经理对企业的前途充满信心。
