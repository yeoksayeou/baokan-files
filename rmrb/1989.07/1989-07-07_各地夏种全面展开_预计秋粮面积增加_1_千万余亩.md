Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 7th.

Summer planting has begun across the country. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the northeastern provinces, Inner Mongolia, Qinghai, and Tibet have completed their planting. It is estimated that this year's autumn grain planting area will exceed 10 billion mu, an increase of over 100 million mu compared to last year.

Information from various regions indicates that there are many favorable factors for autumn grain production this year. Firstly, many local party and government departments have started to focus more on agriculture, and farmers' production inputs this year are significantly better than in previous years. Secondly, the area planted with corn, which accounts for a large portion of autumn grain production, is also expanding. According to statistics from Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning provinces, the corn planting area has increased by over 200 million mu compared to last year. Thirdly, the area using improved production technologies has expanded. According to statistics, the area planted with hybrid corn this year has increased by 100 million mu compared to last year.

Experts point out that ensuring a good autumn grain harvest is crucial for achieving a bumper grain harvest for the entire year. Local authorities must not relax their efforts just because of the good summer grain harvest. They must promptly implement various agricultural production measures and strive to achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest this year.

    各地夏种全面展开
    预计秋粮面积增加1千万余亩
    据新华社北京7月7日电（记者蒲立业、李文茹）全国夏种工作已在各地全面展开。据农业部提供的情况，东北三省、内蒙古、青海、西藏现已播种结束，预计今年全国秋粮种植面积10亿多亩，可比去年增加1000万亩以上。
    各地传来的信息表明，今年秋粮生产有许多有利因素。首先，许多地区党政部门的工作重点开始向农业倾斜，各地农民生产投入明显好于往年。其次，占秋粮生产大头的玉米面积也呈扩大趋势。据黑龙江、吉林、辽宁三省统计，玉米种植面积比去年增加200多万亩。第三，增产技术开发应用面积扩大。据统计，今年杂交玉米面积比去年增加1000万亩。
    有关专家指出，抓好秋粮生产对夺取全年粮食丰收至关重要。各地绝不可因夏粮丰收而有丝毫懈怠，必须及早落实好各项农业生产措施，千方百计夺取今年农业的全面丰收。
