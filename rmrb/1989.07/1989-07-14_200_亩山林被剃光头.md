The 200 mu of forest in Baidu Tang Mountain in Tongmu Dui Village, Zhongxia Township, Lupu County, Hunan Province, includes 20 mu of collectively owned forest and the remaining 180 mu of responsibility forest owned by 51 households. In late February of this year, dozens of people from neighboring Honghua Yuan Village and Yan Ying Ping Village came to the mountain to steal trees. Tongmu Dui Village sent people to seek help from relevant departments, but to no avail. Therefore, Tongmu Dui Village organized more than 20 people to go up the mountain and cut down trees for two days, completely deforesting the 20 mu of collective forest. At the same time, the 51 households also cut down trees in their responsibility forests. Within 10 days, the 200 mu of forest became a barren hill.

On April 16, we saw in the village that every household had piles of dozens or even hundreds of small pine trees in front of their doors, some of which had no use and were only used as firewood.

It is understood that the state-owned Leifeng Mountain Forest Farm adjacent to Tongmu Dui Village also has a serious problem of stolen timber. From late March to early April, about 500 cubic meters of timber were stolen by surrounding villagers.

### 200亩山林被剃光头

    200亩山林被剃光头
    湖南溆浦县仲夏乡桐木坨村的白土堂山林面积有近200亩，其中20亩是村里集体所有，其余的是这个村51户农民的责任山。今年2月下旬，邻近的红花园村、岩鹰坪村有几十人上山偷树。桐木坨村派人向有关部门求助，但毫无结果。于是，桐木坨村便组织了20多人，上山伐树两天，把村里所有的20亩山林一砍而光。同时，51户村民也都在自己的责任山上砍伐林木。10天内，200亩山林变成了秃岭。
    4月16日，我们在村里看到，农民家家户户门前堆放着砍伐来的几十根或上百根小松树，有些小松树无使用价值只有当柴禾。
    据了解，紧靠桐木坨村的国营雷峰山林场，林木被盗伐的情况也十分严重，从3月下旬到4月上旬，这个林场被周围农民盗伐林木约500立方米。
