Every Thursday, the Beijing Blood Center receives individual blood donors. A villager from a certain place in Hebei Province is seen here holding a large bowl of water. As the blood center staff begins to call out names, the previously noisy crowd falls silent. Those whose names are called smile, while those who are not called look dejected, as they are those who failed the physical examination.

Usually, the blood center accepts voluntary blood donors from various units. Compared to the farmers, city dwellers seem more pampered. Each unit brings along beverages and snacks for the donors. When the examination results come out, some people who hear their names called are taken aback: "Really, they are going to draw my blood!" Before a single drop of blood is drawn, their faces turn pale.

Blood, an essential part of human life, is now seen by some as too sacred to share even a drop with others; at the same time, it is seen by another group as a money tree, and this sacred blood becomes contaminated and muddled.

Voluntary Blood Donation – A Heavy Burden for Various Units

With the development of medicine, the demand for blood in China is increasing by 10% each year. However, the main source of blood in China – voluntary blood donation by citizens – is facing difficulties.

Statistics show that if 5% of the population donates blood, the supply would be sufficient. However, even in Beijing, where the blood donation task is relatively well-completed, only 1.4% of the population donates blood. Over the past few years, the living standards of the Chinese people have improved significantly, and diseases related to overnutrition, such as hypertension and coronary heart disease, have increased in incidence and mortality rates, similar to those in developed countries. Obesity, caused by overnutrition, is also a widespread concern in society. However, these favorable external conditions have not helped voluntary blood donation out of its predicament. A few years ago, a certain village in Haidian District was an advanced unit for blood donation, with every household donating blood each year. In recent years, as the living standards of this village have improved significantly, it has since "said goodbye" to blood donation. Some people say this is because they have contracted "affluenza."

As people become wealthier, blood becomes more precious. In recent years, units mobilizing employees to donate blood have had to pay increasingly high costs. In addition to the blood center providing about 50 yuan in nutritional subsidies, the unit has to subsidize at least 200 yuan, with some even reaching 800 yuan. Additionally, there are various forms of leave, travel, and even lottery tickets for televisions and bicycles.

The conditions are becoming increasingly demanding, yet mobilizing qualified citizens to donate blood remains a daunting task. In desperation, medical personnel from various units flock to the blood donation centers to plead their cases.

The public security department says: Currently, we are in the midst of a severe crackdown on criminal activities, and we request a deferral of blood donation. Police officers are under constant high-pressure work, so please consider reducing the number of donors by half.

News agencies say: Reporters are often out on assignments, working hard, and printing plant workers are exposed to lead types, so we request a reduction in the number of donors.

Factories say: Our factory is an old one with many elderly workers engaged in high-temperature, high-intensity work, so we request a reduction in the donation quota...

There are too many special units, and it is hard to find any that are not special.

One donor said: The higher the price, the more precious the blood seems, and the less willing people are to donate. Voluntary blood donation has become "high-price donation."

Individual Blood Donation and Blood Brokers

In addition to voluntary blood donation by citizens, each city has a team of individual blood donors who, after registration, generally donate blood every four months. Currently, the subsidies for voluntary blood donation by various units are becoming increasingly high, yet there are still many people who are unwilling to donate. Some individual blood donors see an opportunity to take advantage of this.

Some people see that a certain unit cannot meet the quota of donors and come to impersonate others. These people have poor blood quality and use someone else's qualified health certificate, leading to serious consequences. A certain blood center discovered an Australian antigen-positive individual impersonating someone else to donate blood. Fortunately, it was discovered in time, averting an accident. Due to the large number of impersonators, the blood center also requires that, in addition to a qualified health certificate, donors must also have a work certificate, and both certificates must match before blood can be drawn. Some unit leaders, in order to meet the blood donation quota, even issue work certificates to these impersonators. Last year, the Shanghai Blood Center found that 15 people from a certain factory came to impersonate others to donate blood. On April 6 this year, when they came to donate blood, the blood center staff immediately recognized several familiar faces and asked the unit leader in charge: "Are there any impersonators this year?" The response was straightforward: "No." However, it was found that six or seven "old customers" were impersonating others, presenting work certificates from the same factory. From last June to now, Shanghai has discovered 80 units doing this.

Some units take an irresponsible attitude towards the blood donation task, and blood brokers emerge in response. They control a group of people who make a living by selling blood, giving half of the subsidy from the unit to the farmers who come to donate blood, and pocketing the other half themselves. These are genuine "bloodsuckers."

Voluntary Blood Donation – The Ideal Blood Source

In 1948, the International Red Cross Society called for the promotion of voluntary blood donation worldwide, and many countries responded enthusiastically. Our neighboring country, Japan, has a voluntary blood donation rate of around 7%, which is also advanced in the world. When Japan began implementing the voluntary blood donation system in 1964, its national economic conditions were similar to China's today. Due to the strong desire of the people to change the blood-selling system, after 20 years of effort, they finally reached today's level. There are still many countries in the world where blood donation has not even gone through the stage of providing nutritional subsidies.

The Soviet Union has a population of only over 200 million, but the number of people donating blood is 12.3 million; China has a population of 1.1 billion, but the number of people donating blood is only 6 million. The number of people donating blood reflects not only a country's economic and cultural level but also its moral level.

The reason for China's backwardness in blood donation is that the Chinese people have a mystical view of blood, believing that "blood is given by parents, and drawing some blood will deplete one's vitality." When the American blood delegation visited China, they introduced that the United States is a developed country where blood donation is very common. However, relatively speaking, in this country, people of Chinese descent are relatively indifferent to blood donation. Is this not influenced by traditional culture?

To eliminate the fear of blood donation and promote voluntary blood donation by citizens is the only way to change the tight blood supply in China. Under the advocacy of some enlightened individuals, the voluntary blood donation team in China is growing year by year. In Beijing, the number of voluntary blood donors increased from 1,093 in 1986 to 6,668 in 1988. In Shanghai, the number increased from 475 in 1986 to 5,031 in 1988. Xuzhou City began implementing voluntary blood donation in 1988, and that year, 2,700 people extended their arms.

Even countries like Tanzania, Mauritania, and Nepal, which are third-world poor countries, have universally implemented voluntary blood donation and have already surpassed China.

A comrade from the Chinese Red Cross Society said that a social custom of voluntary blood donation should be established. Many leaders have set an example in this regard, but it is far from enough. If China's 48 million Communist Party members can take the lead in extending their arms, China will become the world's largest blood source.

    公民，请伸出你的胳膊
    ——献血站的呼吁
    本报记者　蒋涵箴　艾　笑
    北京市血液中心，每周四接待个体献血人员。来自河北某农村的老乡在此捧着大碗喝水，血站人员开始点名，吵吵嚷嚷的人群顷刻安静下来。凡听到点了名者，脸上露出了笑容，凡没有点到名的，一个个垂头丧气，那都是体格检查不合格者。
    平时，血站接受各单位的公民义务献血者。比起老农民来，城里人显得那么娇惯，各单位都随车捎来了供献血员吃喝的饮料、点心。体检单下来了，有人听到了自己的名字，顿时傻了眼：“真的要抽我的血！”血尚未抽一滴，脸吓白了。
    血液，人的生命不可缺少的东西，现在被一些人看得过分神圣，神圣到一滴也不肯为别人贡献；同时它又被另一部分人当作发财的摇钱树，神圣的血被污染了，它变得混沌了。
    公民义务献血——各单
        位的沉重负担
    随着医学的发展，我国用血量每年以10％的速度递增。然而，作为我国血液来源的主要渠道——公民义务献血却步履维艰。
    据统计，我国如果有5％的人献血，血液就足够了，事实上就拿献血任务完成得较好的北京市来说，也只有1.4％的人口献血。我国人民这几年的生活水平有了很大提高，与营养过剩有关的疾病，如高血压、冠心病等发病率、死亡率与发达国家相似，因营养过剩而形成的肥胖症更是社会普遍关注的问题。可是这些优越的外部条件并没有使公民义务献血走出困境。北京海淀区某村前几年是献血的先进单位，全村200户，每年家家都有人献血。这几年这个村生活水平大大提高，从此就与献血“永别了”，有人说，这是得了富贵病。
    人富了，血也宝贵了。这几年，单位动员职工去义务献血，付出的代价越来越大，除了血站付出50元左右的营养费之外，单位至少要补贴200元，有的高达800元，此外还有各种名堂的休假、旅游，甚至发彩电票、自行车票。
    条件越来越高，可动员合格的公民出来献血仍然是困难重重，在无可奈何的情况下，单位的医务人员纷纷到献血站说情。
    公安部门说：目前处于严厉打击刑事犯罪的高潮中，要求缓期献血。干警长期处于紧张工作状态，请考虑缩减一半献血人数。
    新闻单位说：记者常年在外采访，工作辛苦，印刷厂工人接触铅字，要求缩减人数。
    工厂说：本厂是老厂，老工人多，从事高温、高强度作业，要求缩减任务……
    特殊的单位太多了，几乎没有不特殊的单位。
    一位献血者说：价儿给得越高，就越显得血宝贵，也就越不愿意献血。公民义务献血成了“高价献血”。
      个体献血与无空不
        入的血贩子
    除了公民义务献血，各城市都有一支个体献血队伍，他们经过登记，一般每4个月献一次血。目前各单位对公民义务献血的补贴越来越高，尚且还有许多人不愿意献，某些个体献血者就来钻空子。
    有的人看到某单位凑不满献血的人数，就上你单位来冒名顶替，这些人血液质量极低，他们冒用别人的合格体检证，带来了严重的后果。某血站发现一名澳抗阳性者顶替别人来献血，幸亏及时发现，才避免了一次事故。由于顶替者甚多，血站又规定公民义务献血除了有体检合格证外，同时还要有工作证，两证相符才能抽血。有的单位负责人为了应付献血指标，竟然还给这些人发工作证。去年上海血站发现某工厂有15人来冒名献血，今年4月6日来献血时，血站工作人员一眼就看到好几张熟悉面孔，问该厂带队人：“今年有冒名的吗？”回答很干脆：“没有”。结果查出六七个冒名的“老户头”，亮出的却是该厂的工作证。从去年6月到现在，上海市发现有80个单位干了这种事。
    一些单位对献血任务采取不负责任的态度，血贩子们应运而生，他们掌握一批常年靠卖血为生的人，把单位给的补贴一半给来献血的农民，另一半自己捞进了腰包，这是一批名副其实的“吸血鬼”。
    无偿献血——理想的血源
    1948年，国际红十字会在全世界呼吁推广无偿献血，很多国家积极响应，东邻日本无偿献血率在7％左右，这在世界上也是先进的。日本在1964年开始实行无偿献血制度时的国民经济状况同我国今天的情况基本类似。由于国民要求改变卖血制度的愿望非常强烈，经过20年的努力，终于达到了今天这样的水平。世界上还有许多国家献血都没有经过发给营养费的阶段。
    苏联人口只有2亿多，而采血人数为1230万；中国有11亿人口，采血人数只有600万。采血人数的高低，不仅反映了一个国家的经济文化水平，也反映了社会的道德水平。
    中国献血落后，原因之一是炎黄子孙对血有一种神秘感，“血是父母所给，抽掉一些血就会丧了元气”。美国的血液代表团访问中国时曾介绍说，美国是一个发达国家，献血非常普遍，可是相对来说，在这个国家的华裔人对献血就比较冷漠，这难道不是受传统文化的影响吗？
    破除对献血的恐怖感，提倡公民无偿献血，这是改变我国血源紧张的唯一出路。在一些有识之士的倡导下，我国的无偿献血队伍正在年年增大。北京1986年无偿献血1093人，1988年达到6668人，上海1986年无偿献血475人，1988年达到5031人。徐州市1988年开始实行无偿献血，当年就有2700人伸出胳膊。
    像坦桑尼亚、毛里塔尼亚、尼泊尔这样的第三世界穷国，也都普遍实行了无偿献血，他们已经走在中国的前面。
    中国红十字会的同志说，应该创立一个无偿献血的社会风尚，许多领导在这方面作了表率，但远远不够。中国4800多万共产党员能带头伸出胳膊，我国就将成为世界上最大的血源。
