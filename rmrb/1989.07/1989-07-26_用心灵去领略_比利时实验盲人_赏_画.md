Blind people can now "appreciate" paintings, a novel development that has recently taken place in Belgium.

Not long ago, a small art gallery in Brussels held an unusual exhibition. The works on display were more than 80 pieces by some famous modern Belgian artists. Each piece had two versions: the original and a replica. The originals were hung on the walls as usual, while the replicas were laid flat on tables, specifically for blind people to "appreciate."

The replicas closely resembled the originals, but upon close inspection, one could see that the surfaces of the replicas were uneven, allowing blind people to "appreciate" the works by touching them with their hands. The organizers of the exhibition, the Deckerings, said that allowing blind people to appreciate artworks was a first in the world. They believed that excluding blind people from the enjoyment of art was unreasonable. "Appreciating art is a right for everyone, not just a privilege for a few," they said.

Above one of the works, there was a quote from the French writer De Saint-Exupéry: "Only with your soul can you truly appreciate. The eye cannot see the essence."

Mr. Deckerings is a professor at a university in Brussels and is passionate about the education of the disabled. To make this exhibition a success, he found a special type of double-layered paper coated with resin. When heated, the printed images or lines on this paper would rise above the surface. The Deckerings used this method to create the replicas.

The reactions of the blind people to the exhibition were varied. "It's difficult to understand what the artists want to express. For example, this piece, I just can't figure it out," said Bernard, who has been blind since childhood, as he slowly touched a modernist work with a complex pattern of circles and shadows.

Another blind person, Wanzegert, was very interested in a piece featuring the well-known cartoon character Tintin and his dog. She said, "I've heard so many stories about them and often imagined what they looked like. Today, I finally have a clear picture in my mind. This is a real discovery."

The exhibition included works that depicted everyday life, cityscapes, and rural landscapes with simple lines, as well as modernist pieces composed of geometric shapes. Mrs. Deckerings said, "It's hard to say whether we have overestimated the ability of blind people to recognize things through touch. This is just a technical exploration of possibilities."

### 用心灵去领略——比利时实验盲人“赏”画

    用心灵去领略
    ——比利时实验盲人“赏”画
    盲人们也可以“欣赏”绘画作品了，这是最近在比利时出现的一件新鲜事。
    不久前，布鲁塞尔的一座小画廊举办了一次别开生面的画展，参展的是比利时一些著名现代画家的八十多幅作品，每幅作品都有两件，一件原作，一件复制品。原作像往常一样挂在墙上，复制品则平放在桌上，专供盲人们“欣赏”。
    复制品和原作十分相似，只有贴近去看，才能发现复制品的画面凸凹不平，盲人们可以通过用手触摸而“欣赏”作品。画展的主办人戴克宁科夫妇说，让盲人们来“欣赏”艺术作品，这在世界上还是第一次。他们认为，盲人们被排除在艺术欣赏的大门之外是毫无理由的，“欣赏艺术品是所有人的权利，而不只是某一部分人的特权。”
    在一幅作品的上方，人们可以看到法国作家德·圣依科斯伯利的语录：“只有用你的心灵才能真正领略。肉眼是看不见精华所在的。”
    戴克宁科先生是布鲁塞尔一所大学的教授，热衷于残疾人教育事业。为了办好这个画展，他费尽心机找到了一种特殊的涂有树脂的双层复印纸。这种纸加热后，复印的画面或线条就会凸出。戴克宁科夫妇用这种方法制成了复制品。
    盲人们对展览的反应是复杂的。“要理解艺术家们想说些什么是困难的。比方说这一幅画，就叫我怎么也捉摸不透。”自小失明的比尔纳德一边说，一边慢慢用手触摸着一幅画面是一套复杂的圆圈和阴影的现代派作品。
    另一位盲人万兹格特对画着家喻户晓的卡通人物丁丁及其爱狗的作品很感兴趣。她说：“我听到的有关他们的故事太多了，过去也常常想象他们两个的模样，直到今天才心中有数。这是一次真正的发现。”
    这次展出的作品既有反映人们日常生活、城市建筑和田园风光的线条简单的速写，也有一些由几何体组成画面的现代派作品。戴克宁科夫人说：“很难说我们是不是过高估计了盲人们通过感觉认识事物的能力。这只是一次从技术上探索可能性的实验。”
