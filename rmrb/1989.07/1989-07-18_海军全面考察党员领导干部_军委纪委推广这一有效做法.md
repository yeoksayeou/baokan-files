Currently, the Navy is conducting a comprehensive examination of the party nature, party discipline, and party ethics of party member leaders at the regiment level and above. After conducting a pilot examination in the Navy, the Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission forwarded their experiences to the entire military, pointing out that this approach is an effective measure for strictly managing party member leaders, especially high-ranking officials.

This examination began as a pilot project in the first half of last year. After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Navy Party Committee and Discipline Inspection Commission focused on political discipline and corruption issues, examining the party nature, party discipline, and party ethics of party member leaders at the regiment level and above.

During the examination process, the Discipline Inspection Commission teams visited units at the regiment level and above, using multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form methods, particularly emphasizing the democratic appraisal of cadres and the masses. They examined whether party member leaders could firmly align with the Party Central Committee politically, uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, and oppose bourgeois liberalization. The examination teams first listened to the regiment-level Party Committee secretaries' evaluative introductions regarding the party nature, party discipline, and party ethics of the Party Committee and its standing committee members. They then conducted individual interviews with standing committee members, department heads, and retired senior cadres, and held various types of sit-down meetings with the participation of the masses. They listened to the self-evaluations and mutual evaluations of standing committee members, and to the democratic appraisals of the cadres and masses regarding the party discipline of the regiment-level Party Committees and party member leaders. They also conducted on-site examinations in the troops to verify whether the actual situations reported orally by the regiment-level Party Committee leaders and written in documents were consistent. Subsequently, the examination teams presented the examination results to the regiment-level Party Committees, ensuring that each standing committee member could hear the opinions of the masses and the results of public opinion polls. The regiment-level Party Committees and party member leaders studied and formulated specific rectification measures for the issues that the masses were most dissatisfied with during the examination, particularly the issues of corruption and malpractices.

So far, the various levels of the Navy Party Committees and Discipline Inspection Commissions have examined the party nature, party discipline, and party ethics of over 3,000 party member leaders at the regiment level and above. Through the examination, over 200 regiment-level party member leaders who were honest and diligent were commended. A small number of party member leaders who were not honest were severely criticized and educated. Twenty-two military and division-level party member leaders involved in corruption issues were seriously investigated, with two military-level, four division-level, and twenty-eight regiment-level party member leaders receiving disciplinary actions. This has significantly improved party discipline and ethics, and has brought about a new situation in the construction of clean government in units at the regiment level and above.

    海军全面考察党员领导干部  军委纪委推广这一有效做法
    新华社北京7月18日电　（记者黄彩虹）目前，海军正全面开展对团以上党员领导干部党性党风党纪的考察。中央军委纪委在海军进行考察试点后向全军转发了他们的经验，指出这一做法是对党员领导干部特别是高级干部实行严格管理的一个有效措施。
    这次考察是从去年上半年开始试点的。党的十三届四中全会召开后，海军党委和纪委又以政治纪律和廉洁问题为重点，考察团以上党员领导干部的党性党风党纪。
    在考察过程中，纪委考察组深入到团以上单位，采用多层次、多渠道、多种形式，尤其重视听取干部群众的民主评鉴，考察党员领导干部能否坚定地同党中央在政治上保持一致，能否坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。考察组首先听取团以上党委书记对党委和常委成员党性党风党纪情况的评鉴性介绍，接着找常委成员、机关和部队的干部及离退休老干部个别谈话，并召开有群众参加的各种类型座谈会，听取常委成员自我评鉴和相互评鉴，听取干部群众对团以上党委和党员领导干部党风情况的民主评鉴；还深入到部队基层作实地考察，验证团以上党委领导口头汇报和文件上写的实际情况是否一致。然后，考察组把考察结果同团以上党委逐一见面，让每个常委都能听到群众意见和民意测验结果。团以上党委和党员领导干部对考察中群众反映最不满意的不正之风及腐败问题，研究制定具体的整改措施。
    到现在为止，海军各级党委和纪委已对3000多名团以上党员领导干部进行了党性党风党纪的考察。通过考察，表彰了200多名廉洁奉公、艰苦奋斗的团以上党员领导干部，对少数不廉洁的党员领导干部进行了严肃的批评教育，对22名涉及腐败问题的军师级党员领导干部作了认真查处，其中对2名军职、4名师职和28名团职党员领导干部作了党纪处分，从而促进了党风党纪的明显好转，使团以上单位的廉政建设出现了新局面。
