The capital's press and media held a symposium today to study Deng Xiaoping's speech and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

After carefully studying the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee and related documents, some responsible comrades from the press and media units present proposed that news work must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, that news reform must not deviate from the fundamental direction, and that the press and media should seriously summarize experiences and lessons.

The capital's press and media, after experiencing this turmoil, are reflecting calmly on the past and the future. Li Yan, deputy minister of the Propaganda Department, who presided over the symposium, said that reviewing the work of newspapers and periodicals over the past two months, there are profound experiences and lessons to be summarized. At the critical moment, some newspapers and periodicals' guidance of public opinion committed serious errors. Over the years, major debates in news theory and viewpoints have almost all been reflected in this historical turning point and have undergone the test of social practice.

Shao Huaze, editor-in-chief of the People's Daily, said that the core issue of reflection is that news reform must adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles. The Party, the government, and the people all hope that we will do a good job in reform, but the key issue is what ideology will guide news reform. There has been a serious disagreement on this point in the press and media. For a while, it has been the fashion to regard those who advocate adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles in news reform as rigid and conservative, even as opposing reform, making it difficult for people to speak out. Some people's notion of news reform is to change according to the bourgeois model, making our newspapers free from the Party's leadership. He believes that adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles will not hinder or limit news reform but will be beneficial to carrying out such reform.

Fan Jingyi, editor-in-chief of the Economic Daily, said in his speech that due to the relaxation or abandonment of the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, the news team has undergone many changes that we do not want to see. In recent years, the Party's leadership over news work has been forgotten, and it is rarely heard that Party newspapers, Party nature, the role of the mouthpiece, hard work, honesty, and a solid style of work are emphasized. Ugly phenomena such as deception have emerged in the news team. He believes that the news reform carried out in recent years has achieved great results, changing the old models and methods of expression in the past, but for a period of time, news reform has been distorted, and some people have advocated so-called objectivity, fairness, and weakening the function of newspapers as the Party's mouthpiece. He proposed that we should carry out news reform under the guidance of the Four Cardinal Principles.

He said that after this turmoil, we have awakened from a dream and, with pain in our hearts, should seize this opportunity to carry out a rectification of ideology, style, and organization in the news team, building a team that consciously adheres to the Four Cardinal Principles and consciously resists bourgeois liberalization.

Yang Weiguang, deputy director of the Central Television Station, said that the guidance of public opinion has had problems in the past period, and the news community itself also has deep-seated reasons. The main problem is that during the reform and opening up, the Four Cardinal Principles have not been adhered to, and various bourgeois news viewpoints from the West have been spread, especially in news education and theoretical research, where some correct viewpoints have been confused. Absolute news freedom is emphasized, discipline is not mentioned, and one side is emphasized while the other side is denied. Our television news team is still relatively young and needs to strengthen the education of Marxist-Leninist journalism.

Ma Qingxiong, deputy minister of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, emphasized that radio and television are the Party's propaganda tools. He suggested that the news community should undergo re-education in Marxist-Leninist journalism; the education of journalism in schools should be reformed; and efforts should be made to strengthen external propaganda, as our voice is weak compared to the rumors and slanders against us from abroad.

Xu Xinhua, deputy editor-in-chief of Xinhua News Agency, said in his speech that through this turmoil, he deeply felt that news workers have a heavy responsibility. Whether reporters, editors, or other staff, they should all work diligently. An important lesson for news workers in this turmoil is how to adhere to the correct political direction and how to adhere to the correct guidance of public opinion. Without political direction, simply emphasizing so-called "objectivity," what is the purpose of this "objectivity"? News work cannot be separated from political direction. The facts have shown that only by standing on the side of the Party, the state, and the people can we adhere to the correct guidance of public opinion. Everything has phenomena and essences, but how to choose is a kind of guidance. Only by choosing those things that truly reflect the essence of things can it be called objective.

Liu Hushan, editor-in-chief of the Beijing Daily, felt in his practice of running a newspaper that to adhere to the correct direction of the newspaper, one must talk about Party nature and Party discipline. He said that our newspaper is the Party's mouthpiece. For a period, the Party nature principle could not be talked about, and there were readers who reflected: "The Communist Party runs a newspaper against the Communist Party, what is this about?" He said that during the turmoil, our newspaper did some beneficial work. Those days were full of rumors, and we promptly reported the true facts, dared to publish the correct voices of the people, and our "People's Voice" column has published nearly 20 issues. After the masses understand the truth, they immediately became enlightened.

The symposium was organized and convened by the Propaganda Department's Press Bureau. Wang Renzhi, minister of the Propaganda Department, spoke on how the news community should propagate and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Deng Xiaoping's speech.

Participants in today's symposium also included responsible comrades or representatives from the Central People's Broadcasting Station, Liberation Army Daily, Guangming Daily, Workers' Daily, Farmers' Daily, Legal Daily, Beijing Television Station, Beijing Radio and Television Bureau, and the All-China Journalists Association.

### 中宣部新闻局召开座谈会  新闻界要认真总结经验教训

    中宣部新闻局召开座谈会
    新闻界要认真总结经验教训
    新华社北京6月30日电　首都新闻界今天举行学习邓小平同志讲话，贯彻四中全会精神座谈会。
    在认真学习了党的十三届四中全会公报和有关文件后，与会的一些新闻单位负责同志提出，新闻工作必须坚持四项基本原则，新闻改革不能偏离根本方向，新闻界应该认真总结经验教训。
    经历了这场风波后的首都新闻界正在冷静地思考过去和未来。主持座谈会的中宣部副部长李彦说，回顾这两个月的报刊工作，有很深刻的经验教训值得总结，关键时刻有一部分报刊的舆论导向出现了严重错误。这些年来在新闻理论、观点上的重大争论，在这一历史关键时期几乎都有所表现，都经受了社会实践的检验。
    人民日报总编辑邵华泽说，反思的核心问题是新闻改革必须坚持四项基本原则。党、政府和人民都寄希望于我们搞好改革，关键的问题是用什么思想来指导新闻改革，在这一点上新闻界有着严重分歧。前一阵子形成这样一种气候：谈新闻改革要坚持四项基本原则，就被人视作僵化、保守，甚至有反对改革之嫌，使人不好讲话。有些人所讲的新闻改革是按资产阶级模式改，让我们的报纸摆脱党的领导。他认为，坚持四项基本原则绝不是也不会妨碍、限制新闻改革，而是有利于搞好这种改革。
    经济日报总编辑范敬宜在发言中谈到，由于放松或放弃了对资产阶级自由化的斗争，新闻队伍发生不少我们不希望见到的变化。这几年，党对新闻工作的领导被淡忘了，很少听到讲党报、党性，讲喉舌作用，讲艰苦奋斗，讲廉洁奉公，讲扎扎实实的作风。新闻队伍中出现了弄虚作假等丑恶现象。他认为，这几年进行的新闻改革取得了很大成效，改变了过去的陈旧模式和表现方法，但一段时间内，新闻改革遭到歪曲，有些人鼓吹所谓客观、公正、削弱新闻作为党的喉舌的功能。他提出，我们要在四项基本原则指导下进一步搞好新闻改革。
    他说，经过这场暴乱，如梦方醒，痛定思痛，要抓住这个机会对新闻队伍进行一次思想、作风、组织整顿，建设一支自觉坚持四项基本原则，自觉抵制资产阶级自由化的队伍。
    中央电视台副台长杨伟光说，前一段舆论导向出现问题，新闻界本身也有深刻原因，主要是在改革开放中，没有坚持四项基本原则，传播了西方形形色色的资产阶级新闻观点，特别在新闻教育和理论研究中把一些正确观点搞乱了，强调绝对的新闻自由，不讲纪律，片面强调一面而否定另一面。我们的电视新闻工作队伍还比较年轻，更须加强马列主义新闻学的教育。
    广播电影电视部副部长马庆雄强调，广播、电视是党的宣传工具。他建议：新闻界要进行马列主义新闻学的再教育；学校的新闻学教育要作些改造；要加强对外宣传，与外边对我国的造谣、诬蔑相比，我们的声音显得薄弱。
    新华社副总编辑徐心华在发言中说，通过这场风波，深感新闻工作者责任重大，无论记者、编辑，还是其他工作人员，都应兢兢业业地把工作做好。在这次风波中，新闻工作者要记取的一个重要教训就是如何坚持正确的政治方向，如何坚持正确的舆论导向。不讲政治方向，单纯地强调所谓“客观”，这个“客观”要达到什么目的呢？新闻工作不可能脱离政治方向。事实表明：只有站在党、国家和人民的立场上，才能坚持正确的舆论导向。任何事物都有现象、本质之分，但如何选择就是一种导向，只有选择那些真正反映事物本质的东西，才称得上客观。
    北京日报总编辑刘虎山在办报实践中体会到：要坚持报纸的正确方向，必须要讲党性、党纪。他说，我们的报纸是党的喉舌。一个时期党性原则不能讲，有读者反映：“共产党办报反共产党，这是怎么回事？”他说，在动乱中，我们报纸作了些有益工作。那些日子谣言很多，我们及时报道事实真相，敢于发表人民中的正确声音，我们的“人民之声”专栏已发表了近20期，群众了解真情后一下子就觉悟了。
    座谈会由中宣部新闻局组织召开。中宣部部长王忍之就新闻界如何宣传、贯彻四中全会和邓小平同志讲话精神等问题讲了话。
    参加今天座谈会的还有中央人民广播电台、解放军报、光明日报、工人日报、农民日报、法制日报、北京电视台、北京广播电视局、全国记协的负责人或代表。
