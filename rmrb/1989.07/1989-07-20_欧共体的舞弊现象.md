Every year, 8% to 10% of the European Community's budget, amounting to $4 billion to $5 billion, disappears due to fraud. People jokingly refer to this as the work of "white-collar criminals."

Fraud is prevalent in all sectors, but it is most severe in the areas of agricultural subsidies and export subsidies. For example, Sicily in Italy falsely reported having 210,000 dairy cows, and the European Community Commission paid the corresponding subsidies for three consecutive years. However, the Italian government later published statistics showing that the island actually had only 35,000 dairy cows. Another example is a German company that imported 360 tons of butter from Luxembourg, claiming it would be processed and shipped to Sudan. As a result, the Community paid the company over $100,000 in subsidies, but the butter was actually shipped to Belgium. Additionally, from 1982 to 1987, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, and West Germany violated the Community's regulations by purchasing large quantities of a type of full-fat butter called "Nizo" from producers, processing it into butter and skimmed milk, and storing it, earning at least several hundred million dollars in the process.

The inadequate management of the budget and the excessive decentralization of power are significant factors contributing to the prevalence of fraud. In theory, the European Community Commission controls the use of the budget, but in practice, the budget is managed by the governments of the member states. When a member state learns of illegal activities by one of its enterprises, it often turns a blind eye, reasoning that "the money is not flowing to outsiders," so why not take advantage? Furthermore, if the state reports the truth to the Commission, it might face financial penalties from the Commission. As a result, each country adopts a laissez-faire or even protective attitude toward fraud within its own borders.

Additionally, the complexity of budget management regulations provides opportunities for fraud. There are over 4,000 regulations for agricultural products and 932 for processed foods. Too many regulations can backfire, making it easier to exploit loopholes.

According to statistics, the European Court of Auditors handled 5 fraud cases in 1984, which increased to 79 cases by 1988. Recently, the European Council, Commission, Parliament, and Court of Justice have all recognized the seriousness of fraud, which "directly threatens the Community's financial resources." Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, stated, "Our policy reforms, especially the management of the Common Agricultural Policy, may be affected as a result."

Currently, the European Community is considering various measures to address and prevent fraud, such as strengthening coordination among member states to control fraudulent behavior, simplifying regulations, enhancing supervision of import and export ports, effectively and correctly controlling the financial management of this economic entity, implementing a common customs law to control the Community's own financial resources, increasing the number of officials responsible for the budget, and strengthening the organization and personnel of anti-fraud institutions. In the past, each official was responsible for approximately $2 billion in the budget, which was an excessive burden. Additionally, establishing a fine and late penalty system, and strengthening cooperation among European Community member states in criminal law are also being considered.

However, even after implementing these measures, will the European Community be able to completely eliminate fraud? At least, Jacques Delors, the President of the European Commission, is not very optimistic. He believes that action should be taken first, and "if there is no significant progress after two years, then other measures will be considered." It seems that this anti-fraud battle will be a long and arduous one.

    欧共体的舞弊现象
    王淑娟
    每年，欧洲共同体预算的8％至10％，即高达40亿至50亿美元因舞弊而不翼而飞。人们戏谑地称之为“白领犯罪分子”干的勾当。
    舞弊现象遍及所有部门，尤数在共同农业政策补贴和出口补贴方面最为严重。例如意大利西西里岛谎报它养着21万头奶牛，欧共体委员会曾连继3年拨给相应的补贴金。但是，意大利政府后来公布的统计数字表明，该岛实际上只有3.5万头奶牛。又如，西德有家企业从卢森堡进口360吨黄油，说是加工后运往苏丹，于是共同体拨给这家企业10多万美元的补贴金，但黄油却从卢森堡运到了比利时。再如，自1982年至1987年，荷兰、法国、比利时和西德4国违反欧共体有关条例，擅自从生产者那里大批量购进一种名为“尼佐”的全脂黄油，再加工成奶油和脱脂奶储存起来，从中至少获利几十亿美元。
    欧共体管理预算的机构不完善和权力过于分散，是滋生舞弊现象的重要根源。理论上欧共体委员会控制预算的使用，但实际上预算分别掌握在成员国政府手中。而成员国了解到本国某企业有“不法行为”时，又往往装聋作哑，反正是“肥水未流外人田”，何乐而不为？再说，若向委员会如实通报，反而“有可能导致委员会的财政制裁”，结果酿成各国皆对本国的舞弊现象采取漠然置之，甚至“护短”的态度。
    此外，管理预算的法规过于繁琐，也使舞弊者有机可乘。仅农产品法就有4000多项，加工食品法也多达932条。法规太滥了，反而适得其反，易被钻空子。
    据统计，1984年，欧洲审计法院受理舞弊案件5起，到1988年已增至79起。日前，欧共体理事会、委员会、欧洲议会及欧洲法庭均已意识到舞弊的严重性，已“直接危及共同体的财源”。欧共体委员会主席德洛尔说：“我们改革政策的生命力，特别是对共同农业政策的治理，都可能因此而受到损害。”
    目前，欧共体正在酝酿采取一些整治与防范措施，诸如成员国之间加强协调，控制舞弊行为；简化规章条例；加强对进出口岸的监察；有效、正确地控制这个经济实体的财政收支；通过共同关税法，控制共同体的自身财源；增加负责预算的官员。过去，每人平均负责约20亿美元的预算，负担过重；从组织、人员上强化反舞弊机构；建立罚款和逾期罚款制度；加强欧共体各成员国之间在刑事法规方面的合作等等。
    然而，欧共体在实施上述一系列的措施后，果真能杜绝舞弊现象吗？至少，欧共体委员会主席德洛尔就不太乐观。他认为，先干起来再说，“两年后如成效不丰，再当别论。”看来，这场反舞弊斗争，是长期而又十分艰难的。
