    The first high-level export processing zone in China has taken shape on the shores of Dapeng Bay in Shenzhen. Established according to international practices, this bonded industrial zone, with its more open, flexible, and preferential policies compared to the economic special zones, is dubbed by domestic and foreign businesspeople as a "little Hong Kong" on Chinese soil.

    The Shatoujiao Bonded Industrial Zone was approved by the Shenzhen municipal government at the end of 1987. As an experimental point for the continued reform and opening-up of the economic special zones, this industrial zone, upon its establishment, has been dedicated to leveraging the unique geographical advantages of being adjacent to Hong Kong, referencing the relatively successful models of the third-generation export processing zones worldwide, actively introducing and developing technology and capital-intensive industries, providing preferential conditions such as duty-free and inspection-free entry of overseas raw materials into the industrial zone, exploring new systems that operate according to international practices, and new paths for efficiently attracting foreign investment.

    Over the past year and a half, the bonded industrial zone has boldly carried out forward-looking reforms, striving to establish an efficient management system. The bonded zone has set up a management committee that internally manages all affairs within the zone and externally performs the functions of a government agency. Foreign investors coming here to invest, from application to project approval, to completing all relevant registration procedures such as industrial and commercial administration, taxation, and customs, takes no more than two weeks. Investors handling import and export procedures, foreign exchange deposits, withdrawals, remittances, and visa applications can all be completed within 24 hours.

    Developing high-efficiency processing and export is one of the characteristics of the bonded industrial zone. Since the announcement of its establishment, over 400 foreign investors have come to discuss investment opportunities. After screening, 20 projects with good market prospects have been introduced. These projects are mostly high-tech industries such as electronics, textiles, instruments, meters, apparel, and fine chemicals. Some projects have achieved the goal of planning, investment, and return within the same year. The first Sino-foreign joint venture in the zone, Shenzhen Fuhua Industrial Co., Ltd., has recovered all its investments in just five months since it started production in November last year, earning a profit of over 500 ten-thousand yuan. Such investment returns are rare even in overseas processing zones.

    Currently, new factory buildings are springing up in the Shatoujiao Bonded Industrial Zone, and investors are flocking to seek investment opportunities. According to Wang Mulong, the director of the industrial zone management committee, the zone will further improve the investment environment to make overseas investors feel as convenient as they would abroad.

### 经济特区继续改革开放新实验  沙头角保税工业区初具规模

    经济特区继续改革开放新实验
    沙头角保税工业区初具规模
    本报讯　记者孔晓宁报道：我国第一个高层次出口加工区，已在深圳市大鹏湾畔展现雏形。按照国际惯例创办起的这个保税工业区，因奉行比经济特区更加开放、更加灵活、更加优惠的政策，被中外企业家称之为“在中国大地上建造的‘小香港’”。
    沙头角保税工业区是1987年末由深圳市政府批准成立的。作为经济特区继续改革开放的实验点，这个工业区一建立，即致力于发挥沙头角毗邻香港的独特地理优势，参照比较成功的世界第三代出口加工区的模式，积极引进与兴办技术、资金密集型的产业，提供境外原料入工业区免税免检等优惠条件，探索按国际惯例办事的新体制，以及高效率引进外资的新路子。
    一年半来，保税工业区大胆进行超前改革，努力建立起一套高效率的管理体制。保税区专门设立一个管理委员会，对内统管区里一切事务，对外履行政府一级职能。外商到这里投资，从申请到项目审批，直至办妥工商、税务、海关等有关登记手续，不超过两个星期。投资者办理进出口手续、外汇存取汇出及签证等，均在24小时内完成。
    开展高效益的加工出口，是保税工业区的特色之一。保税区宣告成立后，陆续前来洽谈投资的外商有400多家，经过筛选，已引进20个市场前景良好的项目。它们多为电子、纺织、仪器、仪表、服装、精细化工等技术档次较高的项目。其中有的项目做到了当年规划，当年投产，当年收回投资。区内第一个中外合资企业深圳富华实业有限公司，自去年11月正式投产，头5个月即赢利500余万元，收回全部投资。这样的投资效益在海外同类加工区也属罕见。
    目前，沙头角保税工业区内，一座座新厂房正拔地而起，前来寻求投资的客商络绎不绝。据工业区管委会主任王木龙介绍，工业区还将进一步改善投资环境，以使海外投资者到此感到如同海外一样方便。
