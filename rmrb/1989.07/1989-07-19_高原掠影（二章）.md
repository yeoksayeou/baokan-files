	Desert Camel Herders

	You sit, savoring the leisure of the camel herd.
	Beside you is the ancient symbol of a leather pouch, filled with desert dust; and camel grass, growing nearby, adds a few green strokes to your pose.
	And you, merely gaze into the distance for a long time, as if thinking about something, yet clearly thinking of nothing; your pose does not change, nor does your mind. The camel herd is neither too far nor too close, everything seems neither too far nor too close, just like the past, as if it will always be the same.
	Finally, you reach into that pouch, taking out food (perhaps also taking out yearnings and aspirations), and then the Erdos white wine you pull out makes your spirits rise, and the colors of the desert ferment with it—it’s the wind, blowing again.
	You, still chewing, until you chew out the intensity of the sunset, only then do you glance at the camel herd, ready to return with them, and with the sunset.

	Morning in the Desert

	When the morning mist approaches the camel pen, the herd carries the dawn light of the desert (there are also very small camels in there).
	The legs of the young camels are weak, and their humps are still tender, while the melody of the morning light and the thoughts rising with the sun in the distance strike the heart; the desire to venture out with the mother, is stirring.
	Thus, on the morning scene of the desert, a few rows of tender and a few rows of tenacious will be added to this group.
	The desert awakens, truly awakens on the raised heads of the young camels.

    高原掠影（二章）

    大漠牧驼人
    你坐着，品味驼群的安闲。
    身边是那只古老象征的羊皮口袋，盛满大漠风尘；还有骆驼草，丛生在身旁，为你的姿势添几笔绿的色调。
    而你，只是久久地望着远方，似乎在想什么，又分明什么都没想；姿势没有变换，心思亦没有变换，驼群离你不远不近，一切都仿佛离你不远不近，如过去一样，仿佛永远都一样。
    终于，你把手伸到那只口袋里，摸出食物（也许还摸出了憧憬和向往吧），随后掏出的鄂尔多斯白酒，更让你的兴致发酵，大漠的色彩随之发酵——是风，又刮起来了。
    你，依然咀嚼，直到嚼出夕照的浓烈，你这才看一眼驼群，要和它们，和夕阳，一起归去。
    大漠之晨
    当清晨的雾气，袭向骆驼圈的时候，驼群就把大漠的晨光驮起来了（那里面也有很小的骆驼呢）。
    小骆驼的腿孱弱，骆峰也显稚嫩，而晨光曲的旋律，及远方随朝阳逐渐升起的意念，撞击心房；那随母体外出寻觅的欲望，在躁动。
    于是，在大漠清晨的画面上，就要增加这个群体中几行稚嫩，几行顽强。
    大漠醒来了，在小骆驼昂起的头上，真的醒来了。
