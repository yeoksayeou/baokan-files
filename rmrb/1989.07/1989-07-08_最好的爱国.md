Two graduate students from the Archaeology Department of Peking University were conducting archaeological research in the eastern part of Henan Province during the turmoil in Beijing. Their classmates in the university sent them five consecutive letters, urging them to stop their research and return to Beijing to participate in the demonstrations. They replied that as archaeology students, completing their archaeological research project was the best form of patriotism. They remained steadfast and continued their work, ultimately helping to excavate a batch of precious cultural relics from the Shang Dynasty and the Yueshi culture with relevant authorities.

The achievements of these two graduate students are commendable, and their spirit of not following the crowd is even more admirable. During those days of escalating turmoil, a certain atmosphere prevailed, suggesting that students should only participate in demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes to show their patriotism. Anyone who focused on completing the learning tasks assigned by the Party and the people was suspected of not being patriotic. In such circumstances, it was truly rare and precious for these students to propose that archaeology students completing their archaeological research projects was the best form of patriotism and to put this into action.

As descendants of the Yellow Emperor, loving our China is a natural duty. Young people with passionate blood, expressing their patriotism more strongly, is also very natural. But different times call for different forms of patriotism; different positions require different expressions of patriotism. Currently, working diligently and persevering on one's own post to achieve the Four Modernizations and revitalize China is the true and best form of patriotism. If workers do not work, farmers do not produce, and students do not study, what good will shouting "patriotism" do for our country? None at all.

    “最好的爱国”
    黎光
    北京大学考古系两位研究生在北京发生动乱期间正在豫东进行考古研究，在校的同学连续寄去5封信，要他们停止研究，迅速回京参加游行。他们回信表示，我们是考古研究生，完成考古研究课题是最好的爱国。他们毫不动摇，坚持工作，终于同有关方面一起发掘出一批商代文化和岳石文化的珍贵文物。
    这两位研究生取得的成果是可喜的，他们不随波逐流的精神更令人赞佩。在那动乱愈演愈烈的日子里，形成了一种空气，似乎莘莘学子只有参加游行、静坐、绝食才是爱国，谁要是专心致志于完成党和人民交给的学习任务反而有不爱国之嫌。在这种情况下，敢于提出考古研究生完成考古研究课题就是最好的爱国，并且见之于行动，确实是难能可贵的。
    炎黄子孙，爱我中华，天经地义。热血青年，爱国之情表达得更强烈，也很自然。但时代不同，爱国的内容有不同；岗位有别，爱国的表现亦有别。当前，在各自的岗位上为实现四化，振兴中华而扎扎实实、艰苦奋斗才是真正的爱国、最好的爱国。如果工人不做工，农民不生产，学生不学习，“爱国”两字喊得再响，对祖国又有什么好处呢？一点儿也没有。
