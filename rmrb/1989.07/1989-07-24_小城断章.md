	I tread upon the deep alleys of Gunshu Bay from yesterday
	Back then, green dreams grew on the green-tiled roofs
	Today, the distant alleys hide in the folds of memory
	Making me count the years in search
	Before, there were many sorrows
	Flowing from your dreams
	Like charcoal embers burning over time
	Igniting the unnoticed heat in the corners of my eyes
	Now, all the dreams have become landscapes
	The small town begins to hold back

	2
	In my childhood, I drew your round face
	I don’t know how many starry nights I drew
	From the gentle rain of the small town
	You stood up, Fujiang Bridge
	Finally connecting two pairs of hands
	History is not far away
	Grasping the glorious flowers blooming from the soil of both banks
	Already filled with rich and nourishing fruits
	Narrating the moving stories of the small town

	3
	Once again, I am engulfed in the twilight silence of Heyang Town
	The thoughts of Heyang Town
	Follow a few falling leaves, rising and falling
	Slowly dissolving into the evening breeze
	Which leaf should I pick up?
	The entire town is like a vast expanse of autumn water
	Everywhere there are legends of harvest
	The twilight in the depths of Fujiang
	Soaks the body with moonlight
	Contemplating by the water, pointing at the moon as if it were wine
	Heyang Town is like a finger
	Stirring in the sweet wine

    小城断章
    陈显涪
    1
    我踩着枸树湾昨天的深巷而来
    那时　青瓦屋脊长满绿色梦幻
    今天　远巷却藏入记忆的衣襟
    叫我数着岁月找寻
    从前，有许多幽怨
    自你梦中流溢出来
    是久烘着时间的炭火
    点燃眼角那滴不觉中的灼热
    如今，所有的梦都站成了风景
    小城开始有了含蓄
    2
    儿时画你圆圆的面庞
    不知画倦了几多星夜
    从小城柔婉的风雨里
    你站立起来，涪江大桥
    终于联结起两双大手
    历史并不遥远
    攫住两岸泥土开出的绚烂花朵
    已结满了丰实滋润的果
    叙述着小城动人的故事
    3
    再次陷入合阳镇黄昏的静默
    合阳镇的心事
    随几张落叶起伏
    徐徐稀释为晚风
    拾起哪一枚树叶呢
    整个小镇如一片泱泱的秋水
    到处都有收获的传说
    暮色在涪江的深处
    用月光汩汩浸透身体
    临水而悟　指月为酒
    合阳镇如一根手指
    在甜美的酒中搅动
