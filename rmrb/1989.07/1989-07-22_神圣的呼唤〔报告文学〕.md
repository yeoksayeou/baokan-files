Friends, you are fortunate, aren't you? With your companions on a green meadow, by a clear lake, under a canopy of green, in front of a cluster of flowers, looking up, squinting your eyes, seeing a patch of blue sky, a white cloud, a bird...

Yes, you are fortunate. Fortunate to hear the first cry of a newborn; fortunate to receive the first embrace of a lover; fortunate to walk to your post; fortunate to pursue your career... All of this is because your feet are on a piece of land, you have a good environment. The desire to manifest all that makes people happy in a good environment is a wish that has existed since the beginning of humanity. But people often forget everything around them when they are living well. For example, what has happened to the piece of land under our feet now?

Many environmental experts are almost uniformly worried and ask the same question: "How much longer can the Earth survive? How many more generations can humanity continue on this planet?"

Humanity has never been as concerned about the state of this planet as it is now.

"We are all travelers who cannot leave the Earth, all relying on the thin and fragile screen of air and water on the Earth to sustain life, and constantly using and reusing the very limited natural resources of the Earth. Now, every place on Earth that can be inhabited is occupied by humans, and the careful maintenance of the Earth has become an indispensable condition for the continued survival of humanity and the creation of a comfortable life for all the people of the world..."

Beijing. Building Department Guesthouse Room 216. A tall Chinese man paces back and forth in the room. After understanding my purpose, he excitedly told me the above words.

"Now, China's environmental problems have attracted the attention of many writers, which is a fortunate thing," he continued, "For many years, writings, newspapers, and magazines about environmental issues have only been circulated among environmental departments, and the people do not know. The ignorance and indifference of the Chinese people towards the environment have reached a heart-wrenching level. If through literary works, the environmental awareness and good environmental behavior of the entire nation can be awakened, that would truly be fortunate for the Earth and humanity."

He brewed me a cup of tea, but I found that the water was warm, and the tea leaves were all floating on top; he let me peel the apples myself, but I found that the few dried apples had shriveled into wilted lumps. The hurried and laborious research work had made him neglect his life. He was working day and night to write the several hundred thousand words of "Contemporary Chinese Environmental History" and draft the reform plan for the State Environmental Protection Administration.

He is Yanliu.

Yanliu is 56 years old. The 16 years of his life that are the youngest, most charming, and most deeply devoted are the last 16 years, the 16 years he has been involved with China's environment. What are the worries of China's environment? What are the difficulties? What is the way out? He wants to write these questions deeply and thoroughly in "Contemporary Chinese Environmental History," and wants to complete this work of over a hundred thousand words before retirement, otherwise, he feels guilty towards this land. He said he has no great ambitions; he only hopes that when he leaves this world, he can leave a piece of advice for his descendants: We each have two countries, one is our own motherland, and the other is this planet Earth. We only have one Earth, let's cherish our home!

In the 16 years of working on environmental protection, Yanliu has fallen heavily into environmental worries. Global atmospheric pollution has caused global warming, and the ozone layer above the South Pole has holes. If atmospheric pollution ultimately destroys the ozone layers of the North and South Poles, causing the average global temperature to rise by 1-2 degrees Celsius, the ice caps at the poles will begin to melt and flow, and the sea level will rise. At that time, all coastal cities in the world will face annihilation; deserts are devouring the Earth at a rate of 10 hectares per minute! Every year, 6 million hectares of land on Earth turn into deserts. If this is not controlled, by the end of the 21st century, one-third of the world's land will be barren. And China is also leading the world in the rate of land desertification at 10 million mu per year; today, the pressure of population has descended upon the Earth, the world's population will reach 7 billion by the year 2000! Another billion will be reached in less than 7 years. And the atmosphere that can support human survival is being polluted, the water is being polluted, and resources are severely depleted. It is calculated that all iron ore will be mined out by the mid-21st century; copper is also listed in the list of resources to be depleted, as well as oil, and so on... The resources on Earth are very limited, while human demands are unlimited. China's population has already exceeded 1.1 billion, and by 2050, that is, in another 60 years, China's population will reach 1.8 billion. And China's 9.6 million square kilometers of land can accommodate a population of 1.6 billion at most. What to do? The disasters caused by the wrong population policy of the 1950s have fallen not only on every Chinese person but also on every inch of China's land, rivers, forests, grasslands, and sky. Population growth leading to environmental degradation exists globally, but it is even more severe in China. The increase of a large number of uneducated, low-quality population further aggravates environmental degradation. Hundreds of millions of people are carelessly polluting the Yangtze River, the Pearl River, and more rivers, dumping garbage, sewage, coal ash, industrial waste, toxic substances, and large and small feces into the rivers.

Whether the Chinese people are careless about their living environment or make mistakes carelessly, the world is advancing in big strides! On June 6, 1972, after the Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment, the awakened world began to care for and protect this small planet in an unprecedented way. People no longer stubbornly and arrogantly think of themselves as the masters of the Earth; on the contrary, we are just like other living beings, merely relying on the Earth's rich and nourishing biosphere to settle on the Earth. Learning to intelligently manage the Earth has become an urgent task. At the same time, people began to understand what to do to maintain the Earth not only as a place suitable for human habitation now but also for future generations. Like all enlightened people in the world, Yanliu has clearly seen that the biosphere inherited by humanity and the technosphere created by it have lost balance and are in deep conflict. Therefore, he has been calling out with deep concern and enthusiasm, trying to awaken the Chinese people to protect the living environment and save the suffering Earth.

Like a towering rock, he is tall and generous. He is a son of Changbai Mountain and the son of the Keerqin Grassland. He came from the north. He loves the land, the forest, and the thick green grassland that gave birth to and nurtured him. However, once upon a time, the grass on the grassland could not cover the ground, and Keerqin was rapidly desertifying and salinizing; once upon a time, the thousand-mile Changbai Forest Sea, where wild deer, sables, tigers, bears, vipers, frogs, swallows, ginseng, and hundreds of beasts vied for supremacy, was reduced to almost nothing in just over a hundred years. The ancient Changbai Mountain forest, which took thousands of years to form, has lost 90%, and now it is being cut down at a rate of over 6 million cubic meters per year. Once the focus of the United Nations' "Man and Biosphere" protection area, Changbai Mountain is now facing a life-and-death crisis. A nation that has cut down all its trees is also a nation lacking in wisdom; a nation that has lost its trees is also a nation that has lost its civilization. And a nation without culture and low quality is further deteriorating its living environment. The Japanese do not cut down their own trees, and the Koreans do not cut down their own trees. They are willing to import wood at high prices. Once burned into a wasteland by war, Korea now has a forest coverage rate of 80%. The Chinese, however, have been cutting down trees generation after generation; the Koreans raise chickens in the mountains and release them into the forest, while the Chinese hunt chickens for meat and hunt tigers for bravery. Thus, the Northeast tiger has become extinct, and many rare animals in Changbai Mountain have become extinct. As the vice director of the Chinese Environmental Society and the vice director of the Jilin Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau, Yanliu, facing the 16 peaks of Changbai Mountain that have been ravaged, has painstakingly written the seven-part television report script "The Ghosts of the Strange Kingdom," severely criticizing the ignorance and greed of some people.

In 1983, at the Second National Environmental Protection Conference, Yanliu also wrote the film documentary "Protect the Environment, Benefit the People" with deep feelings for the Earth's environment. When the announcer broadcasted the opening words "Our great motherland is rich in resources and has beautiful mountains and rivers, and it nurtures the Chinese nation with its unique environmental advantages" with an extremely heavy heart, Yanliu, who was sitting in the audience, had tears streaming down his face. For this land that suffers like a mother, Yanliu is full of a son's guilt. Yanliu was only 9 months old when he lost his father, and his mother remained a widow for life, raising him and his older brother, Yanshi, with great hardship. In the difficult years without a father, they survived on the grassland and blue sky of Keerqin and the clear springs and flowing waters at the foot of Changbai Mountain. Yanliu loves this land as deeply as he loves his mother. Yanliu, who has dedicated himself to the cause of environmental protection, faces this land that has been sucked dry like his mother, where does his heart go, where does his love go?

Who is the mother of the Chinese people? It is the environment! The cause of environmental protection in China started in 1973 and has a history of 16 years. In these 16 years of hard work, China's environmental problems have encountered unexpected difficulties. "This is China's fate!" Yanliu said. What fate? First, the country has a large population; second, the foundation is weak; third, there is no money; fourth, there is no technology; fifth, some government officials and the people lack environmental awareness. In the past 16 years, these "five difficulties" have formed the psychological inertia of those working on environmental issues in China: China's environment has been made like this, and it is not easy. Let's build first and then protect the environment! The Chinese people have not yet solved the problem of food and clothing, so how can they talk about the environment!

Yanliu does not think this way.

In 1972, Yanliu joined the environmental protection front and became one of China's first environmental warriors. At that time, "environmental protection" was not called "environmental protection," but "three wastes" office, and Yanliu was the deputy director. Those years, he was wholeheartedly thinking about the comprehensive utilization of resources. The Chinese people used to boast about "rich resources and vast territory," and now they are self-deprecating about "little per capita." The essence is not here! How did the Japanese, who have no resources, develop into a world economic power? This needs to be studied! Yanliu of that era did not have a deep environmental awareness. The "highest directive" on the environment and resources only had one sentence: "Comprehensive utilization, there is a lot of room for improvement." This was the only "imperial edict" for those working on environmental protection at that time. Yanliu studied every day, but he was still facing difficulties every day, and the work could not be carried out.

When a person is seriously ill and does not realize it, but instead mocks other sick people, this is very sad. The recognition of environmental pollution and destruction in our country is also similar. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, when we were somewhat arrogant in commenting that environmental pollution in the Western world was "incurable," environmental pollution and destruction were rapidly developing and spreading in our country, but we did not realize it. According to the extreme leftist line of the time, the socialist system could not produce pollution, and whoever said there was pollution was "blackening socialism." Only praise was allowed, and criticism was not allowed. The songs of environmental cleanliness and beauty were blown so that people were tipsy.

Later, the Jilin Provincial Environmental Protection Bureau was established, and Yanliu became the vice director. Standing in this position, Yanliu always thought about doing a few practical things for the people of Jilin Province. In 1982, he overcame numerous difficulties and founded the "China Environmental Management" magazine, and unhesitatingly became the editor-in-chief. From then on, Yanliu, who wanted to do something significant in everything he did, began to study China's environmental theoretical problems!

The second Songhua River, which originates from the Tianchi of Changbai Mountain, is seriously polluted. If no measures are taken, it will be completely destroyed by the end of the 1990s. The rapidly developing industrial city of Jilin City discharges 360 million tons of industrial wastewater into the river every year, a total of over 10 billion tons a year! The toxic pollutants discharged into the river reach 360 kinds, including 26 kinds of carcinogenic compounds. There are already 200 tons of mercury deposited in the water, which will be converted into highly toxic methylmercury under the long-term action of microorganisms, forming a huge disaster for future generations! The fish and shrimp in the second Songhua River are almost extinct. The surviving fish and shrimp and the birds living on both banks of the river have all been found to contain mercury, phenol, cyanide, and other residues. The fishermen along the river have symptoms of methylmercury poisoning. The toxic river water flows to Harbin in 7 days and 7 nights, and the 3 million people of Harbin all drink this river water. Harbin is in a state of emergency! The deterioration of the water quality of the second Songhua River causes economic losses of over 100 million yuan every year to the industry, agriculture, fisheries, and navigation of Jilin City! As the vice director of the provincial environmental protection bureau, Yanliu was extremely anxious. He found the chemical industry company that discharged 70% of the toxic pollutants in Jilin City and angrily said, "Why are you destroying this river like this?" "We pay the state three billion yuan every year!" The company's responsible person said with a clear conscience. "What's three billion? The Songhua River is not for sale even at 300 billion!" Yanliu was indignant and wrote down "The Painful Lesson of Self-Destruction of the Foundation of Survival."

The Chinese people shout "Plant Trees" every year, and later they even formulated a "Tree Planting Day." If we add up all the tree-planting areas reported nationwide in recent years, there would be trees on the roofs of the cities in China, but the actual progress is not optimistic. In recent years, Yanliu has been painstakingly looking for a way to get rid of China's environmental troubles. Where is the way? He finally found that the fundamental reason for the deterioration of China's environment is the system problem, the problem of the quality of the whole nation, not just the lack of money! The imperfect economic system always sacrifices the environment: mining does not cost money, using river water does not cost money, polluting river water does not cost money, land does not cost money, everything is "public." Although our country has formulated a series of environmental protection policies, principles, and regulations, they are not seriously implemented, and the established environmental protection agencies at all levels cannot play their due roles. The Chinese people are used to treating the environmental protection department as dispensable. "Whoever pollutes, whoever treats it" is an important principle of China's environmental management, but it has not been implemented in practice for many years. The superiors of the enterprise, the "mothers-in-law" of the enterprise, and the enterprise itself all eat in the same "big pot," and their responsibilities, rights, and interests are confused. The responsibility for polluting the environment is traced to this place, and it often has to stop and sigh, especially when the government leaders in charge of comprehensive departments are also in charge of environmental protection, it is even easier to "public vs. public, nothing."

The Chinese people like to use "spring" to describe the good political climate. In 1984, it was another spring for China's reforms. In October of that year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the "Decision on Economic System Reform." In the sixth part of the "Decision," there is a sentence: "Urban governments should concentrate their efforts on urban planning, construction, and management, strengthen the construction of various public facilities, and carry out comprehensive environmental improvement..." In the tens of thousands of words of the "Decision," Yanliu was shocked by the above paragraph. He drew line after line under it, excited and restless. He felt that the spring of environmental protection had come! For many years, he was frustrated by the lack of political motivation and the lack of an "imperial edict." Now it's good, the "imperial edict" is here, and he can roll up his sleeves and work! Yanliu knew very well that in China, without an "imperial edict," nothing could be done. He grasped the above paragraph of the "Decision" and talked about it over and over again.

The State Environmental Protection Administration determined that among the 32 cities in the country (municipalities directly under the central government, provincial capitals, and tourist cities), only Haikou City's air pollution did not exceed the standard, and the rest all exceeded the standard value (65-90 micrograms/cubic meter) set by the World Health Organization by 11-17 times. The capital Beijing was the most polluted, and it even exceeded the highest scale of the imported pollution measuring instrument. The United Nations Environment Programme exclaimed: Due to air pollution and industrial dust coverage, Benxi City in China has disappeared from satellite images. The people of Benxi shouted loudly: "Whoever can treat the environmental pollution of Benxi, we will elect him as the mayor!"

Two-thirds of the cities in the country are surrounded by garbage. 455 tons of industrial solid waste surround Beijing, occupying 1.9 million square meters of land, and the garbage mountain of 7900 mu between the Third Ring Road and the Fourth Ring Road can be seen from the satellite!

Facing the serious pollution of China's urban environment, in May 1985, the "China Environmental Management" magazine took the lead in holding the "Urban Environmental Comprehensive Improvement Research Conference" in Xiamen. As the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Yanliu invited more than 20 environmental experts and scholars from all over the country. At the meeting, Yanliu spoke passionately: "In the past, we dreamed of solving environmental problems but had no way. Now the central government has pointed out the way, we should make use of the 'Decision' to do great things! We should immediately get on this train. If we do not participate and miss this opportunity, it will be our sin as environmental protection warriors..."

The Xiamen meeting ended, and Yanliu returned to Beijing. It happened to be the time when the China Environmental Management Economic and Legal Society was holding its annual meeting in Beijing to study the annual scientific research plan. As a standing member of the society, Yanliu proposed the topic of "Urban Environmental Comprehensive Improvement Research" and requested to personally undertake the research of this topic. The society agreed to his request, and the State Environmental Protection Administration supported this topic and allocated 200,000 yuan. Yanliu took on the heavy responsibility and went to the seriously polluted Jilin City for fieldwork! A year later, the State Council held the National Urban Environmental Protection Conference in Luoyang, and Yanliu was ordered to go to Luoyang three times to prepare for it. After the meeting, he directed and personally wrote the commentary for the documentary film "The Dawn of the City," which recorded this historic turning point.

The following year, the "Jilin City Urban Environmental Comprehensive Improvement" project won the second prize for scientific and technological achievements in Jilin Province, and in 1988, the project won the third prize for national scientific and technological progress. With the improvement of Jilin City and the second Songhua River pollution, Yanliu's one article after another on environmental research theory came out: "China's Environmental Protection is Facing a Historic Great Change," "Implementing the Overall Policy of Environmental Improvement Makes China's Economy and Environment Gradually Move Towards a Coordinated Development Track," "On the Strategic Thinking and Theoretical Basis of Comprehensive Environmental Improvement," "On the Major Trends Facing China's Environmental Management"... In just three years, Yanliu published more than ten articles on environmental research theory. The voice of a warrior who is loyal to China's environmental protection cause and sincerely protects this planet is shouting and thinking in these ink-scented texts, calling for the revival of national civilization. Yanliu is sincerely contributing his wisdom to the construction of China's environmental theory.

In June 1988, the director of the State Environmental Protection Administration, Qu Ge Ping, went to Britain for a visit. Before his departure, Yanliu hurriedly handed him a "Urban Environmental Comprehensive Improvement Assessment Method." He hoped to get the approval of this loyal warrior. Qu Ge Ping carefully read the document and then handed it to the deputy director of the Policy and Law Department of the State Environmental Protection Administration, Hu Baolin: "Old Yan's material has his own views, this is a very thoughtful thing, it has directionality, let him polish it a bit more." Two months later, the State Council issued the "Decision on Urban Environmental Comprehensive Improvement." In January 1989, the State Council solemnly issued the "Decision on the Quantitative Assessment of Urban Environmental Comprehensive Improvement."

At the environmental management meeting of 7 provinces and cities in Beijing, Qu Ge Ping said: "The assessment method for urban environmental comprehensive improvement has been issued, you do your best, and we will supplement the imperfections. The original designer of this design is here!" Qu Ge Ping pointed to Yanliu sitting next to him. From then on, the environmental awareness of the governors and mayors of China and their responsibility for environmental quality will no longer be a castle in the air! The excellence of urban environmental management will be included in their performance appraisal and the resulting rewards and punishments, as well as appointments and dismissals, making them, while focusing on economic construction, have to consider how to do a few solid things for the people in the environment, and have to consider how to take some responsibility for maintaining the safety of the Earth.

Lunchtime had passed, and Yanliu invited me to have lunch with him—scallions boiled with instant noodles. He peeled the scallions and clumsily cut them with a paper cutter on the glass top of the coffee table. Seeing this, sympathy and emotion surged in my heart: "Is he living like this?" On the third day of the Spring Festival, without finishing the Spring Festival, he rushed back to Beijing from the distant Changchun. He could have stayed at home for a while longer to accompany his wife and hug his lovely grandson. He had the right to enjoy family happiness. However, he couldn't stay! In the past few months, he had been secluded and rarely went out, working day and night in the guesthouse, writing one article after another. The State Council decided to establish the "China Environmental Strategy Research Center" of the State Environmental Protection Administration and appointed Yanliu as the person in charge of the "Research Center." Before taking office, he had to think about many things: the predicament, future, and way out of China's environment; the national strength and social comprehensive power of China's environmental protection cause, etc.

"We need to re-examine human survival methods and change this way of survival. At present, this primitive way of survival, which plunders the Earth, ultimately pays the price of destroying the environment. Our country has formulated many environmental protection regulations, but in principle, they are defined, but people do not know and do not understand. How many people know that environmental protection is a basic national policy of our country? Why is it defined as a policy? Many problems need to be explained clearly in theory and practice, and need to be repeatedly and loudly propagated. I write articles to awaken a kind of consciousness, a kind of spirit. I am a small person, and my voice is weak. Many people cannot hear it. But it is still a sincere wish."

While saying the above words to me, he sometimes sank heavily into the sofa, and sometimes looked out the window with shining eyes. Looking at his tall figure, I felt a heavy worry, a sacred revelation.

    神圣的呼唤〔报告文学〕
    梅洁
    一
    朋友，你很幸福，是吗？和你的伙伴在一片绿草地，一泓明湖畔，一盖绿荫下，一丛鲜花前，仰起头，眯起眼，看一片蓝天，一朵白云，一只鸟……
    是的，很幸福。幸福地聆听第一声婴儿的啼唤；幸福地接受恋人的第一次拥爱；幸福地走向你的岗位；幸福地奋求你的事业……这一切，都因为你的脚下有一块土地，你有一个好环境。力图在好环境里体现人幸福的一切，这是自有人类以来就有的愿望。但人往往在过好日子的时候会忘却周围的一切，比如我们脚下这块土地，现在到底变得怎样了？
    许多环境研究专家几乎都忧心忡忡地提出同样的问题：“地球还能生存多久？人类在这颗行星上还能繁衍多少代子孙？”
    人类从来没有像现在这样对我们这个行星的现状表示出极大的忧虑。
    “我们都是离不开地球的一群旅行者，都以地球上薄薄而脆弱围屏里的空气和水来维持生命，并且不断使用和再使用地球上非常有限的自然资源。现在地球上凡是能住人的地方都为人占有，对于地球的细心维护已成为人类继续生存和为全世界人民创造舒适生活必不可少的条件……”
    北京。建设部招待所216房间。一位高大的中国男性公民在室内来回踱步。当他明白了我的来意之后，便激动难安地对我说了上面的话。
    “如今，中国环境问题已引起了许多作家的关注，这是一件幸事，”他接着说，“许多年来，关于环境问题的著述、报纸、杂志仅仅只在搞环境的部门中间传播，国民不知道。中国人环境意识的淡薄和无知已到了令人焚心的地步。倘若能通过文艺作品唤醒全民族的环境意识和良好的环境行为，那真是地球的幸事，人类的幸事。”
    他为我沏好一杯茶，但我发现，水是温的，茶叶全漂在上面；他让我自己削苹果吃，但我发现，那几只风干的苹果已皱成了一个个蔫团。匆忙而辛劳的研究工作已使他不注意生活。他正日以继夜地赶写几十万字的《当代中国环境史话》和草拟国家环境保护局体制改革方案。
    他就是岩流。
    二
    岩流今年56岁。56岁的生命中最年轻、最富有魅力、最一往情深的是后16年，后16年他和中国的环境干上了。中国环境的忧患是什么？困境是什么？出路何在？他要在《当代中国环境史话》里把这些问题写深写透，要赶在离休前把这上百万字的东西交给后代，否则，他觉着愧对这块土地。他说他没有大的奢望，他只望在他离开这个世界时，留给子孙们一句忠言：我们每个人都有两个国家，一个是自己的祖国，一个是地球这颗行星。我们只有一个地球，爱护我们的家园吧！
    从事环境保护工作16年来，岩流已沉重地跌入环境忧患之中。世界性的大气污染已使全球出现气候回暖，南极上空的臭氧层已出现空洞。倘若大气污染最终破坏了南北两极的臭氧层，使世界平均气温上升摄氏1—2度，两极的冰帽开始融化涌动，海洋面即要上升，那时，世界所有沿海城市都将面临灭顶之灾；沙漠正以每分钟10公顷的速度吞噬着地球！地球每年有600万公顷的土地变为沙漠，倘若得不到控制，到21世纪末，全世界将有三分之一的土地荒芜。而中国也正以每年1000万亩的土地沙化速度居世界领先地位；当今，人口的压力已降临给地球，世界人口到2000年将达到70亿！另一个10亿不用7年就可达到。而可供人类生存的大气在污染，水在污染，资源在严重匮乏。据计算，全部铁矿石将在21世纪中叶采光；铜也被列在将消耗完毕的清单里，还有石油，还有……地球上的资源是非常有限的，而人类的索取是无限的。中国的人口现已超过11亿，2050年，也就是再过60年，中国人口将达到18亿。而中国960万平方公里的土地容纳人口的极限是16亿，怎么办？由五十年代错误的人口政策造成的灾难不仅落在每一个中国人身上，也落在每一寸中国的土地、河流、森林、草原、天空上。人口激增而导致的环境恶化在全球都存在，中国则更甚。大量增加的无知识、低素质的人口，更加剧着环境的恶化。几亿人在漫不经心地污染长江、珠江和更多的河流，垃圾、废水、煤灰、工业废渣、有毒物质、大小粪便纷纷倒入江河。
    无论中国人对生存环境漫不经心也好，不断地随意性犯错误也好，世界是在大踏步前进了！1972年6月6日，斯德哥尔摩人类环境会议之后，觉醒的世界开始对我们这个小小的行星进行前所未有的关怀和维护了。人们不再顽固而高傲地只认为自己是地球的主人，恰恰相反，我们只是同其它生物一样，仅仅是依赖地球上丰厚泽润的生物圈在地球上定居的，学会明智管理地球已成为一项紧迫的任务。同时人们开始懂得，应该干些什么才能保持地球不仅成为现在适合于人类生活的场所，而且将来也适合子孙后代居住。像世界所有的有识之士一样，岩流已清醒地看到，人类所继承的生物圈和所创造的技术圈已失去了平衡，正处于深刻的矛盾之中。于是，他以深刻的忧患和热忱奔走呼号，力图唤醒国人，保护生存环境，拯救受难的地球。
    三
    像突兀耸立的岩石，他很高，很豪爽坦荡。他是长白山的儿子，科尔沁草原的儿子。他从北方来。他爱生他养他的那方土地、那方森林、那方厚厚的绿草地。然而，曾几何时，草原的草遮不住地皮，科尔沁在大踏步地沙化碱化；曾经是野鹿紫貂、虎熊出没、蝮蛇吸蛙、雨燕飞天、山蔘红艳、百兽争雄的千里长白林海，仅仅一百多年的历史，几百亿立方米的原始森林在一片斧钺声中砍伐殆尽，千古形成的长白山原始森林，丧失了90％，眼下，仍以每年600多万立方米的速度被砍伐着。曾经成为联合国“人与人物圈”的重点保护区的长白山，正在经历一个生死存亡的危难时刻。一个把树木砍伐殆尽的民族，也是一个缺乏智慧的民族；一个树木凋敝的民族，文明也在凋敝。而一个没有文化的低素质民族，又在日趋恶化着生存环境。日本人不砍自己的树，朝鲜人也不砍自己的树，他们宁愿出高价进口木材。曾经被战争烧成一片焦土的朝鲜，如今森林覆盖率已达到80％。中国人却在世世代代“砍砍伐檀兮”；朝鲜人养山鸡放回森林，中国人打山鸡吃肉，打虎逞雄。于是，东北虎在绝迹，长白山里许多珍奇动物在绝迹。作为中国环境学会理事、吉林省环境保护局副局长的岩流，面对遭劫的长白山16座山峰，他苦心编写了七集电视报告文学脚本《特异王国的幽灵》，对一些人的无知、贪婪进行无情的鞭挞。
    1983年，全国第二次环境保护会议上，岩流又以对地球环境深厚的感情，编写了《保护环境，造福人民》的电影纪录片。当播音员用无比沉重的心情播出片首语“我们伟大的祖国资源丰富、山川秀丽，以她得天独厚的环境优势养育着中华民族”时，坐在观众席上的岩流，眼泪夺眶而出。对于这块母亲般受难的土地，岩流充满着一种儿子的负疚。岩流生下9个月便失去父亲，母亲终生守寡，含辛茹苦拉扯他和哥哥岩石。在没有父亲的苦难岁月，他们母子三人靠科尔沁的草地和蓝天，靠长白山脚下的清泉和流水活了过来。岩流像深爱母亲一样深爱这块土地。献身于环境保护事业的岩流，面对着像被吮干了血的母亲一样的土地，他心往何寄，情往何依？
    四
    中国人的母亲到底是谁？是环境！中国的环境保护事业从1973年起，已有16年的历史。16年磋砣岁月，中国的环境问题遇到了意想不到的困难。“中国就是这个命！”岩流说。什么命？第一，国家大人口多；第二，底子薄；第三，没有钱；第四，没有技术；第五，一些政府官员和国民缺少环境意识。16年来，这“五难”形成了中国搞环境问题的人的心理惰性：中国的环境搞成这样就不容易了，先建设再搞环保吧！中国人温饱还没解决，谈得上什么环境！
    岩流不这么想。
    1972年，岩流到了环保战线，成为我国第一批环境战士。那时的“环保”不叫“环保”，叫“三废”办公室，岩流做办公室副主任。那些年，他一心一意想着资源的综合利用。中国人过去总爱自吹自擂“地大物博”，现在又很自卑“人均少”。本质不在这儿！日本人没有资源怎么发展成世界经济强国的？得研究这个！那个年代的岩流，并没有多深的环境意识，“最高指示”对环境，对资源只有一句话：“综合利用，大有文章可做”。这就是那个时期搞环保工作的唯一的“尚方宝剑”。岩流天天研究，但仍天天困难，工作无法开展。
    当一个人患了重病，自己没有觉察，反而讥笑其他患病的人，这是很可悲的。对我国环境污染和破坏的认识，也有着类似的情形。60年代末、70年代初，在我们颇有些自负地评论西方世界环境公害是“不治之症”的时候，环境污染和破坏正在我国急剧地发展和蔓延，但我们并未察觉。按照当时极左路线的理论，社会主义制度是不可能产生污染的，谁要说污染，谁就是“给社会主义抹黑”。只准颂扬，不准批评，环境清洁优美的颂歌，吹得人们醺醺欲醉。
    后来成立省环境保护局，岩流当了吉林省环保局副局长。站在这个位置上，岩流总想着为吉林省人民实实在在办几件事情。1982年，他克服重重困难，创办了《中国环境管理》杂志，并义无反顾地当了总编。从那时起，干什么都想干出个名堂的岩流开始潜心研究中国环境理论问题了！
    发源于长白山天池的第二松花江在严重污染，若不采取措施，到90年代末，即被彻底摧毁。高速发展着的工业城市吉林市排入江中工业废水360多万吨，一年多达10亿多吨！排入江中的有毒污染物达360多种，其中致癌化合物达26种。水体中已沉积200多吨汞，在微生物的长期作用下将转化为巨毒甲基汞，形成危害子孙后代的巨大祸患！第二松花江鱼虾几乎绝迹，幸存的鱼虾和栖息在江两岸的鸟类体内均检出了汞、酚、氰等残毒，沿江渔民已有甲基汞中毒症状。有毒的江水7天7夜后就流到了哈尔滨，哈尔滨300万人民都吃这江中的水，哈尔滨连连告急！第二松花江水质恶化，给吉林市工农业、渔业、航运业造成的经济损失每年达1亿多元！作为省环保局副局长，岩流焦急万分。他找到排放污染物占吉林市全部有毒污染物总量70％的某化学工业公司气愤地说：“你们为什么这样糟踏这条江呢？”“我们每年向国家交三个亿”！公司负责人心安理得。“三个亿算什么？松花江300个亿也不卖”！岩流义愤填膺，沉重写下《自毁生存根基的沉痛教训》。
    中国人年年喊植树，后来还制定了“植树节。”若把全国这些年上报的植树面积加起来，中国城市的房顶上都有树了，实际进展却不容乐观。几年来，岩流一直在苦苦寻找一条摆脱中国环境困扰的路，路在何方？他终于发现，中国环境恶化的根本原因是体制问题，是全民素质问题，不完全是缺钱！不完善的经济体制总是以牺牲环境为代价：开采矿山不要钱，用江河水不要钱，污染江河水不罚钱，土地不要钱，一切姓“公”。虽然我国制定了一系列环保方针、政策和法规，但得不到认真贯彻执行，已经建立的各级环保机构不能发挥应有的职能。中国人习惯把环保部门看得可有可无。“谁污染谁治理”是我国环境管理的一条重要方针，但多年来，在实践中得不到执行。企业的上级主管，企业的所有“婆婆”和企业本身，都在一个“大锅”里就餐，他们之间的责权利混乱，污染环境的责任追到此地，往往只好止步兴叹，尤其是遇到分管综合部门的政府领导人恰恰又分管环保工作，就更容易“公对公，一场空。”

    中国人喜欢用“春天”来形容政治上出现的好气候。1984年，是中国改革的又一个春天。这一年的10月，中共中央《关于经济体制改革的决定》颁布了。《决定》的第六部分中有句话：“城市政府应该集中力量做好城市的规划、建设和管理，加强各种公用设施的建设，进行环境的综合整治……”在洋洋数万言的《决定》中，岩流竟然被上面这段话给震动了。他在下面划了一杠又一杠，激动难安。他感到环保的春天来到了！多少年来，他苦于政治上没有动力，没有“尚方宝剑”。现在好了，“尚方宝剑”有了，可以挥开膀子干了！岩流深知，在中国要办成一件事，没有“尚方宝剑”不行，他抓住《决定》中的那段话大讲特讲。
    国家环保局测定：全国32个城市（直辖市、省会和旅游城市）只有海口一个城市的大气中污染物没有超标，其余全部为世界卫生组织规定标准值（65—90微克／立方米）的11—17倍。首都北京为大气污染之最，居然超过进口测污仪表最高刻度。联合国环境署惊呼：由于大气污染，工业粉尘的覆盖，中国的本溪市已从卫星图片上消失。本溪人大声疾呼：“谁能治理本溪的环境污染，我们就选谁当市长！”
    全国2／3的城市陷入垃圾重围。455吨工业固体废物包围着北京，占去了北京190万平方米的土地，卫星上已看到北京三环路、四环路之间7900亩的垃圾山！
    面对中国城市环境严重污染的现状，1985年5月，《中国环境管理》杂志率先在厦门召开“城市环境综合整治研究会”。作为该杂志总编的岩流，从全国各地邀来了20多名环境专家和学者。会上，岩流慷慨激昂：“我们过去梦寐以求解决环境问题，没路可走。现在中央指出了路，我们应该利用《决定》大作文章！我们应该立即搭上这班车，倘若我们再不参与，错过这个时机，这将是我们环保战士的罪过……”
    厦门会散，岩流回到北京，正值中国环境管理经济与法学学会在京召开年会，研究年度科研计划。作为该会常务理事的岩流提出了“城市环境综合整治研究”的课题，并要求亲自担任该课题的研究。学会同意了他的要求，国家环保局支持这个课题，拨款2万元。岩流身负重任，到污染十分严重的吉林市蹲点！一年后，国务院在洛阳召开全国城市环保会议，岩流奉命三下洛阳进行筹备。会后他编导并亲自撰写解说词的电影纪录片《城市的曙光》记下了这次历史性的转折。
    次年，“吉林市城市环境综合整治”课题获吉林省科研成果二等奖，1988年，该课题获国家科研进步三等奖。随着吉林市和第二松花江污染的被治理，岩流一篇接一篇的关于环境研究的理论文章相继问世：《中国环境保护面临着历史性的大变革》、《实行综合整治环境的总政策使中国的经济与环境逐步走向协调发展轨道》、《论综合整治环境的战略思想及其理论基础》、《论中国环境管理面临的大趋势》……仅仅3年时间，岩流接连发表了十几万字的理论文章。一个忠诚于中国环境保护事业、真诚维护我们这颗行星的战士的心声在这散发着墨香的文字中呐喊着、深思着，声声呼唤民族文明的复兴。岩流在建树中国环境理论上真诚地贡献着他的心智。
    1988年6月，国家环保局局长曲格平去英国考察，临行之前，岩流匆匆将一份《城市环境综合整治考核办法》交给这位中国环境保护的创业人，他希望能得到这位忠诚的战士的首肯。曲格平认真看完此件，然后将它批给国家环保局政策法规司副司长胡宝林：“老岩这个材料有自己的观点，这是个很有思路的东西，带有方向性，让他再好好整整。”两个月后，国务院《关于城市环境综合整治的决定》颁布了。1989年1月，国务院又郑重颁布了《关于城市环境综合整治定量考核的决定》。
    北京，7省市环境管理会议上，曲格平说：“城市环境综合整治的考核办法已出台了，你们尽量去做，不完善的大家补充。这个设计的最初发明者在这儿！”曲格平指着坐在他旁边的岩流。至此，中国的省长和市长们的环境意识以及他们对环境质量的负责制便不再是空中楼阁！城市环境管理的优劣将纳入他们的政绩考核以及由此而产生的奖罚和任免，使他们在抓经济建设的同时，不得不去考虑怎样在环境方面为老百姓扎扎实实办几件事，不得不去考虑怎样为维护地球的安全尽一些责任了。

    中午已过，岩流请我和他一起吃午饭——大葱煮方便面。他剥好葱，在茶几的玻璃板上用裁纸刀笨拙地切着。见此，同情和感动一起涌上我心头：“他就这样生活？”大年初三，没过完春节，他就从遥远的长春赶回了北京，本可以在家多陪一段妻子，抱抱可爱的小孙子，他有权享受天伦之乐。然而，他呆不下去啊！几个月来，他深居简出，在招待所里日夜伏案，一篇接一篇地著书立说。国务院决定国家环保局成立“中国环境战略研究中心”，任命岩流做“研究中心”的负责人。上任之前，他要思考许多事情：中国环境的困境、前途和出路；中国环境保护事业的国力潜能和社会综合动力等等。
      “我们需要重新认识人类的生存方式，要改变这种生存方式。目前，这种原始的对地球采取掠夺性撷取的生存方式最终是以摧毁环境为代价。我们国家规定了不少环境保护法规，但原则上定了，人们不知道，不明白。有多少人知道环境保护是我国的基本国策？为什么定为国策？许多问题都需要从理论和实践上阐述清楚，并要反复地大张旗鼓地宣传。我写文章旨在唤醒一种意识，一种精神。我是小人物，我的声音很弱，许多人听不到。但总归是一个虔诚的心愿吧。”
    对我说着上面的话，他时而沉重地跌坐在沙发里，时而两眼炯炯地望着窗外，望着他高大的身躯，我感到了一种沉重的忧患，一种神圣的昭示。
