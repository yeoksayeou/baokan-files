According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 29th: Liaohai Oilfield has carried forward the fine tradition of hard work and self-reliance, tapping into internal potential, and striving for increased production and savings. Over four years, it has saved the state 500 million yuan.

Faced with this situation, Liaohai Oilfield has vigorously promoted the repair and reuse of old and damaged equipment, saving every penny for the state. Over the past four years, it has repaired and reused over 3,000 sets of discarded or damaged transformers and electric motors. It has also unearthed over 200,000 meters of old pipelines from the ground, and after processing, these have been put back into use.
