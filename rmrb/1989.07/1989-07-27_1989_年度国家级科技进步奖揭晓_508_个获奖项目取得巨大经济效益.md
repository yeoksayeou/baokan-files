The 1989 National Science and Technology Progress Awards have been announced. A total of 508 projects have won awards, including 3 special prizes, 35 first prizes, 154 second prizes, and 316 third prizes, which require approval from the State Council.

The first feature of these award-winning projects is that the vast number of Chinese scientists and technologists have addressed the country's needs, conducted cross-industry and multi-disciplinary collaborative research, solved a series of major scientific and technological problems, created enormous economic benefits, and played a significant role in promoting China's economic development. Among the 25 special and first prize projects, preliminary statistics show that 16 projects have generated a total of 6.2 billion yuan in increased revenue and savings, with 4 projects earning 520 million US dollars in foreign exchange. For example, the special prize project "Comprehensive Utilization of Resources in Jinchuan" involved Jinchuan Company collaborating with over 50 units and tens of thousands of experts and scholars nationwide to form a cross-industry, multi-disciplinary, and multi-level research team. They tackled numerous complex technical issues in the mine, mining, and metal recovery aspects of this large-scale polymetallic sulfide deposit, conducting 408 specialized studies and achieving 99 major scientific research results. Of these, 78 have been applied in production, changing the long-term reliance on imports for nickel and cobalt precious metals in China and promoting the development of related industries such as national raw materials, defense, and light industry.

The second feature of these award-winning projects is that Chinese scientists and technologists dare to aim at the advanced level of contemporary world science and technology, uphold the spirit of practical innovation, persevere, and strive unremittingly. They have overcome numerous challenges, making a large number of projects reach the world's advanced level. For instance, the special prize project "Development of a 100-Million-Ton-Level Large-Scale Open-Pit Mine Complete Set of Equipment" took advanced foreign models as the target, overcoming many difficulties. The main mining equipment, such as the 250mm-tooth wheel drill with high rock-breaking capability, 10-cubic-meter excavator, and 108-ton electric self-dumping truck, have reached international advanced levels. The successful development of this set of equipment not only ended China's complete reliance on imports for large-scale open-pit mine equipment but also made China the second country in the world capable of producing a complete set of such equipment.

The third feature of this year's award-winning projects is their broad scope and large quantity. There are 46 award-winning projects in the fields of agriculture and forestry, which have made outstanding contributions to promoting technological progress in China's agricultural production, promoting variety updates, improving quality and yield, especially grain production.

It is also worth noting that a considerable number of outstanding national defense science and technology achievements are included in this year's award-winning projects.

According to the person in charge, the results of the 1989 National Science and Technology Progress Awards will be published in the July 28 editions of "Guangming Daily," "Science and Technology Daily," and "China Technology Market News."

    1989年度国家级科技进步奖揭晓
    508个获奖项目取得巨大经济效益
    本报北京7月27日讯　记者何黄彪报道：经国家科技进步奖评委会第四次评审会议审批、核准、推荐，1989年度国家级科技进步奖共有508项，其中需报国务院批准的特等奖3项，一等奖35项，二等奖154项，三等奖316项。
    这批获奖项目的第一个特点是我国广大科技人员急国家之所需，跨行业、多学科协作攻关，解决了一系列重大科学技术难题，创造了巨大的经济效益，为推动我国经济发展起到了重大的作用。民口的特、一等奖25项中16个项目的初步统计，增收节支总额达62亿元，其中有4项还创外汇5.2亿美元。例如特等奖项目“金川资源综合利用”，就是金川公司联合全国50多个单位的数万名专家、学者组成跨行业、多学科、多层次的科研队伍，针对这个大型多金属共生硫化矿在矿床、采矿、金属回收方面存在的许多复杂技术问题，进行了408项专题研究，取得了99项重大科研成果，其中78项已用于生产实际，从而改变了我国长期以来镍、钴贵金属主要依靠进口的状况，促进了国家原材料工业、国防工业和轻工业等有关行业的发展。
    这批获奖项目的第二个特点是我国科技人员敢于瞄准当代世界先进科学技术水平，发扬求实创新的精神，百折不挠，锲而不舍，终于闯过一道道难关，使一大批项目达到了世界水平。如特等奖项目“一千万吨级大型露天矿成套设备研制”，就是以国外先进机型为目标，攻克了许多难关，其中的高破岩能力的250毫米牙轮钻机、10立方米挖掘机和108吨电动自卸汽车等主采设备技术水平，达到国际先进水平。这套设备的研制成功，不仅结束了我国大型露天矿设备完全依靠进口的历史，而且使我国成为世界上能够生产全套设备的第二个国家。
    这次获奖项目的第三个特点是面广量大。农林方面获奖的高达46项，这对于促进我国农业生产的技术进步，促进品种更新换代，提高品质和产量，尤其是粮食生产做出了突出的贡献。
    还要特别指出的是，在这次获奖项目中，还有数量可观的国防优秀科技成果。
    据发布人介绍，1989年度国家级科技进步奖评审结果在7月28日《光明日报》、《科技日报》、《中国技术市场报》上公布。
