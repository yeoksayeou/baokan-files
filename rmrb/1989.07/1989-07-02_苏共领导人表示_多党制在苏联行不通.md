Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 1st.

Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo member Vorotnikov clearly stated on July 1st that a multi-party system is unworkable in the Soviet Union. The only path forward, he said, is to consolidate the position of the Communist Party and improve the party's role as the vanguard of society.

Vorotnikov made these remarks during a meeting with local officials in Chelyabinsk, in the southern Ural region of the Soviet Union.

When asked if there were any other political forces in the Soviet Union that could ensure the normal development of society, coordinate the entire political process, and maintain the unity of a multi-ethnic nation, Vorotnikov responded that "there is no such force other than the Communist Party."

Vorotnikov pointed out that there are currently some individuals in the Soviet Union who verbally support reforms but in reality seek to abandon socialist principles. Some of them disguise their true intentions, while others openly declare their struggle for power. Vorotnikov believes that the influence of these anti-socialist forces on social climate and public sentiment should not be underestimated. He emphasized the need to strengthen the party's work in all aspects.

    苏共领导人表示
    多党制在苏联行不通
    新华社莫斯科7月1日电  苏共中央政治局委员沃罗特尼科夫1日明确表示，在苏联实行多党制是行不通的，摆在面前的只有一条路，那就是巩固共产党的地位，完善党这个社会政治先锋队的活动方式。
    沃罗特尼科夫是在苏联南乌拉尔地区车里雅宾斯克会见当地干部时作这一表示的。
    有人问：在苏联有没有另外的政治力量能够保障社会的正常发展，保障整个社会政治进程的协调一致，保障多民族国家的团结？沃罗特尼科夫回答说，除共产党外“这种力量是没有的”。
    沃罗特尼科夫指出，苏联现在有一些人口头上支持改革，实际上是要放弃社会主义原则，他们有的掩盖起真正意图，有的则公然表示要为夺取权力而斗争。沃罗特尼科夫认为，不能低估这些反社会主义势力对社会气候和人们情绪的影响，应当坚决加强党的各方面的工作。
