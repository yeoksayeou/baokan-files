Cold Creek River, you flow from the heart of the Daba Mountains.

Every green leaf gives you a drop of crystal, every spring eye offers you a string of purity. Thus, you have a river of jade purity and ice-clear water.

The mountains are reluctant to let you go, holding hands to send you off, leaning down to kiss you. Thus, you have the grandeur of the banks and the depth of the shadows.

Gently, you ask: Would you like to take a piece of flowing crystal?

Softly, I reply: Where can one find a knife or an axe to cut water? Oh, the Cold Creek River, so beautiful that it makes one's heart tremble, you flow from the heart of the Daba Mountains.

In the depths of the Daba Mountains, I first met you, Cold Creek River.

So pure, so simple, so profound, so tender, Cold Creek River!

Slowly and tenderly, you sing a song not too long ago: "Remember the chrysanthemums, Huang Jie sent the Red Army up the mountain ridge..." Before the song ends, another begins: "Rhinoceros gazing at the moon..."

Gazing, gazing at the crows crying blood year after year;

Gazing, gazing at the broken not only the autumn water of the Daba Mountains?

The heart is tired of gazing, the eyes are weary of looking, and then this cold stream seeps out?

Eternal mountain moon, you bear witness.

The mountain moon is bright, still singing the song: Chrysanthemums are yellow...

Cold Creek River, I know you, in the sacred depths of the Daba Mountains.

    寒溪河
    陆政英
    寒溪河，你是从大巴山心窝窝淌出来的。
    每片绿叶都赠你一粒晶莹，每个泉眼都给你一串纯净。你便有了一河玉洁冰清。
    山们舍不得你，手拉着手送你，争相俯身亲你。你便有了岸的厷峙与幽深。
    款款地你问：想截一片流动的水晶去么？
    轻轻地我答：哪里去寻能断水的刀斧呢？美得令人心颤的寒溪河呵，你是大巴山心窝窝里淌出来的。
    在大巴山的腹地，我初识你，寒溪河呵。
    那么清淳，那么朴质，那么深邃，那么柔情的寒溪河哟！
    缓缓而深情，你吟唱那曲年辰并不久远的歌：“记得那年菊花，黄姐送红军上山梁……”一曲未终，又一曲：“犀牛望月……”
    望呵，望杜鹃岁岁啼血；
    望呵，望断的岂止是巴山秋水？
    心望累了，眼望穿了，才沁出这一泓冷冷的溪流么？
    不老的山月啊，你作证吧。
    山月朗朗，仍唱那曲：菊花黄……
    寒溪河呵，我认识你，是在大巴山圣洁的腹地。
