The State Council Office recently transmitted to the people's governments of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as various ministries and commissions under the State Council, and directly affiliated institutions, the views of the State Bureau of Technical Supervision on severely punishing those responsible for selling fake and substandard goods.

The notice states that the State Council has tasked the State Bureau of Technical Supervision with organizing and coordinating the supervision of commodity quality nationwide. In accordance with the current laws and regulations of the state, the Bureau is to take measures to quickly reverse the current situation where fake and substandard goods are rampant in production and circulation.

In the views on severely punishing those responsible for selling fake and substandard goods, the State Bureau of Technical Supervision points out that currently, there are many quality issues with commodities in the market. Fake liquor, fake pesticides, fake seeds, substandard fertilizers, and low-quality electrical appliances are constantly flooding the market, causing serious harm. Serious accidents due to quality issues frequently occur, causing significant losses to national construction and the lives and property of the people. The broad masses of users and consumers are extremely dissatisfied with the quality problems of market commodities and have strong reactions. The severe harm caused by fake and substandard goods has become a factor of social instability.

To curb the circulation of fake and substandard goods, protect the legitimate rights and interests of users and consumers, and encourage trading enterprises to actively resist the entry of fake and substandard goods into the market, the views on severely punishing those responsible for selling fake and substandard goods stipulate that traders must be responsible for the quality of the goods they trade. They must strictly implement the inspection and acceptance system for incoming goods and have the right to inspect the quality of the goods. It is strictly forbidden to trade in the following fake and substandard goods: expired or deteriorated goods; goods that endanger safety and personal health; goods whose stated indicators do not match the actual ones; goods that falsely use high-quality or certified marks and forged permit marks; goods that are adulterated, counterfeit, or pass off old goods as new; goods that are prohibited from being produced or sold by relevant laws and regulations of the state.

The following goods, if pointed out and not corrected, are also considered fake and substandard goods: goods without a certificate of inspection or proof of sale from relevant units; goods without Chinese labels indicating the commodity name, producer, and place of origin (important industrial products without factory addresses); goods with limited use periods but without expiration dates; goods subject to production (manufacturing) permit management but without permit numbers and validity periods; goods that should have Chinese labels indicating specifications, grades, main technical indicators, or components and contents but do not; high-end durable consumer goods without Chinese usage instructions; goods that are classified as processed items (including seconds and rejects) but do not have the word "processed" clearly marked on the goods or packaging; dangerous goods such as highly toxic, flammable, and explosive items without relevant markings and usage instructions.

Those responsible for trading in fake and substandard goods, as well as those who condone or shield such activities, must be severely punished in accordance with relevant laws and regulations of the state. Economic penalties must be heavy to deter them from engaging in such illegal activities.

In cases where the trading of fake and substandard goods results in personal injury, major property damage, serious circumstances, and criminal offenses, they must be handed over to judicial authorities for criminal prosecution. Those who condone or shield the trading of fake and substandard goods should also be held criminally responsible.

    国务院办公厅转发技术监督局意见
    严惩经销伪劣商品责任者
    经济上要从重处罚触犯刑律者追究刑事责任
    据新华社北京7月7日电  国务院办公厅近日向各省、市、自治区人民政府，国务院各部委、各直属机构，转发了国家技术监督局《关于严厉惩处经销伪劣商品责任者的意见》的通知。
    通知说，国务院责成国家技术监督局负责组织协调全国商品质量的监督工作，按照国家现行法律和法规所规定的职能与权限，采取措施，使当前生产、流通领域伪劣商品屡禁不止的状况迅速得到扭转。
    国家技术监督局《关于严厉惩处经销伪劣商品责任者的意见》中指出，当前，市场的商品质量问题较多，特别是假酒、假农药、假种子、伪劣化肥、劣质电器等商品不断冲击市场。愈演愈烈；因质量问题引起的恶性事故屡有发生，给国家建设和人民生命财产造成了很大的损失；广大用户和消费者对市场商品质量存在的问题极为不满，反映强烈；伪劣商品造成的严重危害已构成社会不安定因素。
    为了遏制伪劣商品的流通，保护用户和消费者的合法权益，促使经销企业自觉抵制伪劣商品流入市场，《关于严厉惩处经销伪劣商品责任者的意见》中规定，商品的经销者必须对其经销的商品质量负责，严格执行进货检查验收制度，有权对商品质量进行检验。严禁经销下列伪劣商品：失效、变质的；危及安全和人身健康的；所标明的指标与实际不符的；冒用优质或认证标志和伪造许可证标志的；掺杂使假、以假充真或以旧充新的；国家有关法律、法规明令禁止生产、销售的。
    经销下列商品，经指出不予改正的，即视为经销伪劣商品：无检验合格证或无有关单位允许销售证明的；未用中文标明商品名称、生产者和产地（重要工业品未标明厂址）的；限时使用而未标明失效时间的；实施生产（制造）许可证管理而未标明许可证编号和有效期的；按有关规定应用中文标明规格、等级、主要技术指标或成分、含量等而未标明的；高档耐用消费品无中文使用说明的；属处理品（含次品、等外品）而未在商品或包装的显著部位标明“处理品”字样的；剧毒、易燃、易爆等危险品而未标明有关标识和使用说明的。
    对经销伪劣商品的责任者，以及对经销伪劣商品的纵容者、包庇者，要按照国家有关法律、法规的规定，给予严厉制裁，经济上要从重处罚，使其不敢从事此类违法活动。
    凡经销的伪劣商品造成人身伤亡、重大财产损失、情节严重、触犯刑律的，要移送司法部门依法追究其刑事责任；对经销伪劣商品的纵容者、包庇者，也应追究其刑事责任。
