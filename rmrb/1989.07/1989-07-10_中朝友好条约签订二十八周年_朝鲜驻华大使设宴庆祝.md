North Korean Ambassador to China Ju Chang-jun hosted a banquet at the embassy this evening to celebrate the 28th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between China and North Korea.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Peng Chong, along with officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the International Liaison Department of the Communist Party of China, the General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army, and the China-North Korea Friendship Association, were invited to attend.

Peng Chong, in his toast at the banquet, said that over the 28 years since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between China and North Korea, the friendly cooperative relations between the two countries have developed comprehensively through the joint efforts of both sides. This not only consolidates the traditional friendship between the peoples of the two countries, forged in blood, but also makes an important contribution to the development of the socialist construction of the two countries, to easing the situation on the Korean Peninsula, and to maintaining peace in Asia.

Peng Chong said, "Not long ago, the Chinese government successfully suppressed a riot in the capital Beijing, thwarting the counter-revolutionary plot of a very few people who attempted to overthrow the Communist Party of China and subvert the People's Republic of China. At this critical moment concerning China's destiny, we received the understanding and support of the Party, government, and people of North Korea, for which we express our heartfelt gratitude. We firmly believe that, no matter what storms may arise in the world, the traditional friendship between China and North Korea, forged by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, will be passed down from generation to generation forever."

Ambassador Ju Chang-jun said that the great friendship between the peoples of the two countries is a living example of proletarian internationalism. He said, "In the 28 years since the signing of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance between China and North Korea, the peoples of the two countries have closely united and cooperated in all fields, including politics, economy, culture, and military affairs."

    中朝友好条约签订二十八周年
    朝鲜驻华大使设宴庆祝
    新华社北京7月10日电　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻华大使朱昌骏今晚在使馆举行宴会，庆祝朝中友好互助条约签订28周年。
    全国人大常委会副委员长彭冲，外交部、中联部、中国人民解放军总参谋部、中朝友协等单位的负责人应邀出席。
    彭冲在宴会祝酒时说，中朝友好合作互助条约签订28年来，在双方的共同努力下，中朝两国的友好合作关系，得到了全面发展。这不仅巩固了两国人民之间用鲜血凝成的传统友谊，而且为两国社会主义建设事业的发展、为缓和朝鲜半岛局势、维护亚洲和平做出了重要的贡献。
    彭冲说，“不久前，中国政府在首都北京胜利地平息了一场暴乱，粉碎了极少数人企图推翻中国共产党、颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国的反革命阴谋。在关系中国命运的关键时刻，我们得到了朝鲜党、政府和人民的理解和支持，对此表示衷心的感谢。我们坚信，无论世界上发生什么惊涛骇浪，由两国老一辈无产阶级革命家缔造的传统的中朝友谊一定会一代接一代永远传下去。”
    朱昌骏大使说，朝中两国人民之间的伟大友谊，是无产阶级国际主义的活生生的榜样。他说，“朝中友好合作互助条约签订后的28年期间，两国人民在政治、经济、文化、军事等所有领域紧密团结，密切合作。”
