The Chinese men's basketball team defeated the visiting Soviet national second team 92-73 tonight at the Capital Gymnasium. This was the fourth match between the two teams in nine days, with each team winning two games. The combined score of the four matches shows that the Chinese team leads by just one point.

The newly adjusted Chinese men's basketball team made their debut in front of Beijing fans, facing the Soviet second team from a world basketball powerhouse. However, the match did not attract many spectators. Within two and a half minutes of the start, the home team was already leading by more than 10 points. After that, the Chinese team went several minutes without scoring. Meanwhile, the Soviet team, given this opportunity, did not have a strong offensive and slowly narrowed the gap. By the end of the first half, the Soviet second team led 41-38.

In the second half, the Soviet players became impatient and their actions roughened. Two players were fouled out after committing five fouls each, leaving the Soviet team with only four players on the court to face the Chinese team's five. This rare "four-on-five" situation in basketball occurred because several key players from the Soviet team were unable to join due to domestic competitions, and this visit was made with only eight players, two of whom were injured. Thus, the Chinese team easily pulled ahead in the score, leading by 19 points at the final whistle.

Although the entire match was played at a rather slow pace, people were more focused on the Chinese team's lineup, which included young, tall players like Shuān Tāo, Gǒng Xiǎobīn, and Mǎ Jiàn. Due to the inexperience of these new players in terms of technique, awareness, and experience, there are still doubts about whether this team can win the Asian Men's Basketball Championship this autumn.

    中苏男篮在京较技
    中国男篮胜苏国家二队
    本报北京7月9日讯　记者汪大昭报道：中国男子篮球队今晚在首都体育馆以92∶73战胜来访的苏联国家二队。这是两队9天之内的第四次交锋，双方各胜两场，四场角逐比分加在一起，中国队比客队只多1分。
    调整后的中国男篮首次在北京球迷面前亮相，迎战来自世界篮球强国的苏联二队，但是并没有吸引多少观众。比赛开始两分多钟，主队便领先了10分之多。此后，中国队竟好几分钟不曾进球。而苏联队在这种好机会里，也没有出色的攻势，只是慢慢腾腾地把比分追平。上半时结束时，苏联二队以41∶38领先。
    下半时，苏联球员情绪急躁，动作粗放，两名队员先后五次犯规被罚下场，一度居然只有四名队员在场上同中国队五个人周旋，演出篮球场上罕见的“四打五”。原来客队几名主力因国内赛事难以抽身，此次只以八人组队访华，又出了两员伤号。于是，中国队并不费劲地拉开比分，至终场时净胜对手19分。
    虽然整场比赛双方打得相当疲沓，不过，人们更注目的是由单涛、巩晓彬、马健等年轻高大队员组成的中国队内线，由于几名新人的技术、意识和经验都显嫩，这支队伍今秋能否拿下亚洲男篮锦标，人们尚有疑存。
