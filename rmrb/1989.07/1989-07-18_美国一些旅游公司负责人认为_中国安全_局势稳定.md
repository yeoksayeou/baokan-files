The U.S. State Department issued a warning earlier this month advising against travel to China for safety reasons, causing many Americans planning to visit China to change their plans. However, some U.S. travel companies are actively organizing trips to China. The reporter interviewed two of them.

Aivita McIntosh, president of McIntosh Travel in Dallas, Texas, told the reporter over the phone that her company will organize at least two trips to China in the second half of this year. The first group is scheduled to depart on September 17, led by her personally, and will stay in China for 14 days. This lady, who studied Chinese at Yale University, believes that the current situation in China is stable and that her business in China will return to normal in a few months. She hopes the U.S. State Department will lift the travel warning next month.

McIntosh has visited China 42 times, covering numerous places. Her most recent visit was in April this year. She said that since she began her China tourism business 10 years ago, she has witnessed the development and changes in China's tourism industry, and more and more inland cities have opened up to foreign tourists. She excitedly said that last year at this time, she led a group of American teachers to tour the ancient "Silk Road," traveling as far as Tianshui in Gansu and Kashgar in Xinjiang. "Even though we spent three weeks, it still felt too short, and there were many things we didn't have time to see!"

Lindblad Travel, located in Westport, Connecticut, has a vice president, Mr. Sitterville, who told the reporter that although the State Department's warning has not been lifted, many people still want to go to China. He said, "I believe it is safe to go to China, and the situation there is calm." The company is organizing two groups totaling about 60 tourists to visit China this fall. He also told the reporter that the Chinese tourism authorities have notified them that there is currently an 80% discount for traveling to Beijing. He estimates that China's tourism industry will return to normal by early next year.

Lindblad Travel began organizing trips to China as early as 1978 and was one of the first U.S. companies to do so. "Our company has always maintained a friendly relationship with the Chinese side," Sitterville said. Since 1978, they have organized tens of thousands of American tourists to visit China, with 2,000 people alone last year. He visited Guilin in Guangxi last October and not only admired its beauty but was also pleased with the improvements in the airport facilities. This vice president has visited China about 10 times and particularly loves Chengdu in Sichuan.

When talking about the attractiveness of China, he said that compared to going to some place in Europe or the Caribbean, going to China is a "high-quality" tourism experience because Americans can experience a culture that is vastly different from Europe and America. From a business perspective, he believes that China is the largest tourism market for the United States.

It is reported that about 300,000 Americans visited China last year. Currently, companies such as Pacific International Travel and Kammel Travel are also actively organizing trips to China.

    美国一些旅游公司负责人认为
    中国安全　局势稳定
    本报记者　仓立德
    美国国务院上月初曾发出警告，为安全计最好暂勿前往中国，这使不少想去中国旅游的美国人改变了原定计划。但事实上目前仍有一些美国旅游公司正在积极筹划访华团，记者采访了其中两家。
    得克萨斯州达拉斯市麦金托什旅游公司总裁艾维塔·麦金托什通过电话告诉记者，她的公司今年下半年将至少组织两个团访问中国，首批定于9月17日启程，由她亲自带队，预计在华停留14天。这位在耶鲁大学研究过中文的女士说，她认为目前中国局势是稳定的，几个月后她的中国业务会恢复正常。她希望美国国务院在下月取消对前往中国的“警告”。
    麦金托什已先后42次访华，去的地方之多简直数不清，最近一次是今年4月。她表示，自10年前开始从事中国旅游业务以来，她目睹了中国旅游业的发展、变化，对外国游客开放的内地城镇也越来越多。她以兴奋的语调说，去年此时她带领一批美国教师游历了古代“丝绸之路”，行踪远达甘肃天水、新疆喀什等地，“尽管我们用了3个星期，还觉得太短，有许多东西还没来得及看呢！”
    林德布拉德旅游公司在东部康涅狄格州威斯波特市。公司副总裁西特维尔先生对记者表示，虽然国务院的“警告”还未撤销，但仍有许多人想去中国。他说，“我相信去中国是安全的，那里的局势是平静的”，公司组织的两批约60位游客将于今秋访华。他还告诉记者，该公司已接到中国旅游当局的通告，现在去北京可享受八折优惠。他估计明年初中国的旅游业将恢复正常。
    林德布拉德公司早在1978年即开始组团访华，是美国最先开始中国旅游业务的公司之一。“我们公司一直同中国方面保持着友好关系”，西特维尔说，1978年以来他们已组织了成千上万名美国游客前往中国，仅去年便有2000人。他去年10月游了广西桂林，不但赞赏它的优美，更为那里的机场设施得到改善而感到高兴。这位副总裁至今已访华约10次，尤其钟爱四川成都。
    在谈到中国的吸引力时，他说，比较去欧洲某地或加勒比群岛，去中国是一项“高质量”旅游，因为美国人可以领略一种与欧美迥然相异的悠久文化。从生意角度而言，他认为中国是美国最大的旅游市场。
    据悉，去年共有约30万美国人访问了中国。目前，太平洋际国际旅游公司、凯莫伦旅游公司等都在积极筹划访华团组。　　　（本报华盛顿7月17日电）
