A new type of school jointly operated by an enterprise and the government—Shenyang Woodlan School—has recently been established in Shenyang.

This school is funded by Shenyang Woodlan Electronics Company and is based on the former Shenyang No. 84 Middle School. Both parties have agreed to jointly operate the school for a period of 15 years. In the first three years, the company will invest 1 million yuan to improve the school's teaching facilities. The district education commission will continue to provide educational funds for the former No. 84 Middle School and its affiliated vocational high school. The school will be managed under a board of directors with the principal taking responsibility for daily operations.

It is reported that the company's investment in education is aimed at helping the government alleviate some of its burdens.
