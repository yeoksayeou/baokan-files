    Group Personal Accident Insurance for Primary and Secondary School Students
    Q: In recent years, many places have started offering group personal accident insurance for primary and secondary school students. However, some parents are not clear on how to purchase this insurance. Can you explain?
    A: All students attending various primary and secondary schools in urban and rural areas can participate in this insurance. Unlike other insurance types, the school must collectively purchase the insurance for all students. Individual students cannot purchase the insurance alone.

    Q: How much is the insurance premium?
    A: The annual premium for each primary school student is approximately 2 yuan, and for each secondary school student, it is approximately 3 yuan. The insurance term is one year. Upon the expiration of the one-year term, the school can renew the insurance for everyone.

    Q: What responsibilities does the insurance company bear?
    A: During the insurance period, whether inside or outside the school, at home or elsewhere, any accidental injuries caused by explosions, collisions, electric shocks, burns, poisoning, heatstroke, drowning, suffocation, vehicle, ship, or airplane accidents, animal attacks, or injuries sustained during labor, can be compensated according to the regulations.

    Q: How is the insurance payout determined?
    A: After an accidental injury occurs, medical treatment fees and medication costs can be reimbursed. In the unfortunate event of disability, the appropriate disability insurance payout can be received based on the severity. The maximum insurance payout does not exceed 1000 times the premium paid. For example, if 2 yuan is paid, the insurance company will pay a maximum of 2000 yuan in insurance benefits.

    Q: What situations are not covered by the insurance?
    A: This insurance covers accidental injuries, but it does not cover medical expenses for illnesses, injuries from fights, or costs for fitting artificial teeth, limbs, eyes, or glasses.
