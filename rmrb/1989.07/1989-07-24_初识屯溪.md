Tunxi is not a large place.

Tunxi owes its fame to a mountain, Huangshan, which stands several thousand meters high beside it. This must be a source of pride for the people of Tunxi for generations to come.

After a solitary journey, I arrived in Tunxi at midnight. Knowing only the destination but not the way there was indeed a miserable experience. The stars were not helpful that night, and there was no moonlight.

Blindly searching for a vehicle, I found only more blindness. If it were someone else, I would have laughed heartily at them, but this was me.

“Hey, get on the car,” a fellow traveler on the bus called out to me. I knew this was part of the all-inclusive service to Huangshan, but at that moment, a genuine smile was enough to satisfy me. I complied. Boarding the car aimlessly, the night was pitch black, and I was a bit scared. Knowing the destination but not what lay ahead, and yet rushing forward, it was quite an experience.

Upon reaching the guesthouse, the people of Tunxi said the place I wanted to go required a detour. It was better to stay the night, and the tour bus would take me in the morning. These words were soothing to the ears, and I felt as if I had not traveled eight thousand miles, hearing instead the gurgling sound of the water from Changbai Mountain. The next day, as promised, the driver and the female service staff treated me like family, and I could not express my gratitude enough.

It was the sun that led me to the quite pleasant Jiangxinzhou Hotel. As soon as I checked in, I felt like a long-term guest.

The service staff knew how to communicate with smiles and kindness, which was not easy and made me feel much more comfortable. In places outside Tunxi, there were few opportunities to experience this feeling. The shop assistants here were the same. One day, a few of us went to buy net-like women's clothing. She could have simply taken it from the shelf and thrown it on the counter, but she carefully helped us check for any flaws. The men were all moved.

They are proud to have Huangshan, and Huangshan is proud to have these people, I thought.

As the writers' conference was about to end, people went to climb Huangshan. The hotel sent a guide, a handsome man around 22 years old. He interacted with everyone like a brother, tirelessly and enthusiastically. In two days, he made many friends, and that was us. The most unforgettable moment was during the farewell party when everyone performed enthusiastically. When it was the handsome young man's turn, his rendition of "Meeting and Parting" brought tears to everyone's eyes.

Men and women alike were silent.

People are indeed emotional beings!

Oh, this is Tunxi, these are the people of Tunxi. This made me think of that traveler and the person who led me from darkness to dawn. Remembering the etiquette of the pedestrians on the street, there was no hatred or grievance among them. Life flowed like the Xin'an River, clear and transparent, reflecting the sun's gentle and scattered rays, beautiful enough to make one lost in thought.

Is this the essence of Huangshan? Then I pray that the towering thousand peaks are all enveloped in the mist of Huangshan…

    初识屯溪
    潘　烽
    屯溪这地方不大。
    屯溪沾了一座山的光而有了名气。那就是黄山，几千米高的山站在它的身旁。这该是屯溪人三生也自豪不完的事。
    经历了孤独的旅行，抵达屯溪已是子夜。只知道要去的地方而不知其所行的路的确是苦不堪言。星星不够朋友，那晚没有月光。
    盲目地寻找车子，而找到的还是盲目。倘若是别人我会狠狠地笑他，而这是我自己。
      “喂，上车吧。”车上相识的一位旅游家在唤我。明知这是去黄山一条龙服务的，不过在这个时候能得到一个真诚的笑也够满足的了。我依了他。漫无目的登车，夜漆黑，我有些害怕。知其目的是什么却不知道前方是个啥样子，偏偏还往前冲，想来也够味。
    到了招待所，屯溪人说我要去的地方需要打折路，莫如先住下，早晨旅游车送你。这话柔柔入耳，我似乎没有走出八千里路，听到的是长白山淙淙流水声。翌日果然如此，司机和女服务员像对自家人一样热情，我千恩万谢还没表完心意。
    还是太阳够交情，它把我领进了相当不错的江心州宾馆，一落脚就感到自己好像是个久住的客人。
    服务员会用笑和情说话，这不易，使你陡增不少舒服的感觉。而在这屯溪以外的地方几乎没有给你产生这种感受的机会。这里商店营业员也如此，一日我们几位老兄去买网状的女人装，她完全可以从架子上拿下来，扔在柜子上你爱要不要，但却是细细地帮你抻拽寻找纰漏。男人们都受到感动。
    她们为拥有黄山而自豪，而黄山也在为有这些人们而骄傲，我想。
    笔会将结束的时候，人们去攀黄山。宾馆派出了导游员，那人很帅，22岁左右。他和大家相处如亲兄弟，不辞辛苦，热情周到。两日间他获得了好些朋友，那就是我们。最难忘的是临别的联欢晚会上，人们兴高采烈地出节目，轮到这帅小子的时候，一曲《相见又分手》把人唱得泪在眼里直转。
    男的女的都不笑了。
    人，真是个有情物！
    噢，这就是屯溪，这就是屯溪人。这不能不使我又想起那位旅游家和把我从黑暗送至黎明的人。再忆街上行人的礼仪，相互间没有憎恨和某些不平，生活像那条新安江一样潺潺流动而又那样清澈透明，映着太阳万道温柔错落的霞光，美得叫人痴迷。
    这是黄山的灵气吗？那么我祈祷巍巍千座山峰，都弥漫黄山的云雾……
