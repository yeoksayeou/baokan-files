The first volume of French writer Marcel Proust's masterpiece, "In Search of Lost Time," titled "Swann's Way," has been published by Yilin Press. Reading it, one feels that the author seems to be endlessly recounting his childhood, his family members, his first love, and a person named Swann. One could say there is no plot to speak of.

Perhaps I am ignorant, but I have never seen another writer who can reminisce about their past with such a calm demeanor, such a leisurely mood, and such delicate strokes, endlessly and unceasingly. He seems to be thoroughly enjoying the years that have passed.

He had a fondness for a type of pastry called "Madeleines" since he was young. This memory is not unusual, but what is remarkable is that he could draw so many associations from this pastry and preserve them in his memory.

So, what profound thoughts would he draw from themes as significant to humanity as love and friendship? No wonder the first volume is over three hundred thousand words long. Readers might feel bewildered and not grasp the essence, but the author is full of vigor and seems to have more to say. The second volume, which writes about Swann's love, is even more extraordinary. The author does not insert any intricate or dramatic plot twists, nor does he analyze the emotional journey of the lovers, nor does he use various artistic means to embellish it. Instead, he uses a hundred thousand words to repeatedly describe the inner "love" of a person, achieving a moving and powerful effect. I tried to excerpt a few passages to show the readers, but I couldn't. These hundred thousand words seem scattered but are an indivisible whole. The author expresses a mood, a train of thought, and if one cannot feel its entirety, it would be meaningless.

Generally, a work of literature recognized worldwide is often adapted into a script and performed on stage or screen. Since the first volume of "In Search of Lost Time," "Swann's Love," is the most "visible and tangible" among the seven volumes, German director Volker Schlöndorff set his sights high and used all his skills to adapt this volume into a film. The result was a widespread dissatisfaction among the audience and a failure. The reason is that this magnum opus reflects the author's stream of consciousness, a spiritual phenomenon. If it is transformed into tangible images moving in time and space, it would desecrate the original work's essence and the author's intention. I have often heard people say, "In Search of Lost Time' is untranslatable." Now, I dare to add a sentence: "This work is also impossible to successfully adapt for the screen."

Proust was frail from a young age and only lived to be 51, but he was a spiritual giant. With rare tenacity, he spent over a decade of his life, leisurely and meticulously weaving this masterpiece of over two million words. Naturally, there were specific conditions for this. He grew up in an upper-class intellectual family in France, received a good education from a young age, read a large number of books, and studied the thoughts and creative methods of classical great writers. During his childhood, he would go to a small town in the Bois region with his family every year for vacation. The people he encountered, apart from his parents and numerous relatives, were the Parisian social circle, his classmates, his father's friends, and a few women. His experiences were simple, his social circle narrow, and his knowledge and observations limited. Therefore, he did not delve into his "mine" in breadth but in depth. He was extraordinarily sensitive from a young age, to the point of being neurotic. He suffered from severe asthma at a young age. Initially, he would have a specific time each year to write in seclusion, but later he stopped going out altogether, as the famous French writer André Maurois said, "This seclusion helped him transform life into art." We can imagine that it was loneliness, the torment of illness, extensive knowledge, and extraordinary sensitivity that shaped Proust. Conversely, we cannot imagine that a person bound by fame and wealth, with an impatient mood, busy and hurried, eager to gain fame and fortune, could write such a magnificent and ethereal great work as "In Search of Lost Time."

Some of our newspapers and magazines have introduced Proust in bits and pieces and translated some chapters of this work. Regarding Proust's influence and contributions in the world of literature, the characteristics and value of this representative work, although it has been established in the world of literature for a long time, our readers are still unfamiliar with it. Only when this magnum opus is fully revealed and experts and scholars take an interest in this field and conduct in-depth research, can we say that our country's research on Proust has truly taken the first step.

### 普鲁斯特的巨著

    普鲁斯特的巨著
    韩沪麟
    法国作家普鲁斯特的名著《追忆似水年华》的第一部《在斯万家那边》已经由译林出版社出版了。读之，感到作者似乎在喋喋不休地叙述他的童年生活、家庭成员、初恋，还有那个名叫斯万的人，可以说没有故事情节可言。
    也许我本人孤陋寡闻吧，我确乎未曾见过世上有第二位作家能以如此平静的心境，如此闲逸的情调，如此细腻的笔触，无休无止、不绝如缕地追忆他的过去；他似乎总是在尽情地享受着已逝的年华。
    他从小喜欢吃一种叫“玛德莱娜”的甜点心，这类记忆并不出奇，难能可贵的是他从这种甜点心上能生出如此之多的联想，并在记忆之中保存了下来。
    如此，那么对爱情、友谊等等人类重大的主题，他又会从中引出多少感想呢。难怪第一部书洋洋洒洒三十余万言，读者读后也许惶惶然不得其要领，但作者却劲头十足，意犹未尽哩。本部第二卷写斯万的爱情就更绝了。作者没有在书中穿插曲折离奇、悲欢离合的情节，没有对恋爱者的感情历程加以分析，更没有借助多种艺术手段加以渲染，但竟以十万字的篇幅，反来覆去写其人内心的一个“爱”字，而且达到了动人而强烈的效果。我曾试图摘录其中的几段以示读者，但是办不到。这十万字的内容貌似松散，但又是不可分隔的整体，作者抒发的是一种情调，一种思绪，如不能感受到它的全部，便是毫无意义的了。
    大凡一部举世公认的佳作，每每会被改编成剧本搬上舞台或银幕，既然在《追忆似水年华》的七部之中，第一部的第二卷《斯万之恋》尚属最“看得见摸得着”的，于是德国著名导演施朗道夫便立下雄心，使出浑身解数，把这一卷改编拍成电影，结果引起观众普遍不满，惨遭失败。原因是这部巨著反映作者意识的流动历程，是一种精神现象，如把它改变成有形的形象活动在时空之中，就会亵渎原著的真谛和作者的本意了。我多次听人说过“《追忆似水年华》是不可翻译的”，那么现在我斗胆再补充一句：“这部作品也是不可能在银幕上成功的。”
    普鲁斯特从小体质虚弱，仅活了51岁，但他却是精神上的强者，他能以罕见的韧劲，积十数年之心血，悠悠闲闲、丝丝缕缕地编织出这部长达二百余万言的精品，自然有其特定的条件。他生长在法国上层知识分子家庭里，从小接受过良好的教育，阅读了大量的书，研究过古典大作家的思想及其创作方法。童年时代他每年都要随家人到博斯地区一个小镇度假，他接触的人除父母与众多的亲戚外，就是巴黎社交圈子、中学的同学、父亲的朋友和几个女人；他经历简单，交际面不广，所见所闻有限，所以他不是从广度，而是从深度开掘他的“矿藏”的。他从小就敏感过人，达到神经质的程度。他年纪轻轻就患有严重的哮喘病。起始，他每年都有一定时间闭门写作，后来干脆足不出户了，正如法国著名作家莫洛亚说的，“这种隐居有助于他把生活转化为艺术”。我们可以设想，是寂寞、病体的折磨、渊博的知识、过人的敏感造就了普鲁斯特。反之，我们也不能设想，一个为名缰利索所束缚，情绪急躁，忙忙碌碌，急于成名成家的人能写出像《追忆似水年华》那么恢宏博大，空蒙灵秀的伟大作品来。
    我国的一些报刊对普鲁斯特已作过零星的介绍，也译介过这部作品的部分章节；关于普鲁斯特在世界文学史上的影响与贡献，他的这部代表作的特色与价值等等，虽在世界文坛早有定评，但我国读者还很陌生。只有该巨著全貌问世，有专家学者对这一个领域发生兴趣，进行步步深入探讨时，我们才能说，我国对普鲁斯特的研究才真正迈开第一步。
