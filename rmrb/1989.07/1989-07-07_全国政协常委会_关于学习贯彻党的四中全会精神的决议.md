The Standing Committee of the Seventh National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, at its Seventh Session, studied and discussed the "Communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" and other related documents. It listened to and discussed the report by State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, Comrade Chen Xitong, on the situation regarding the suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. The meeting held that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, held after the decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, was a very important meeting. This meeting is of great practical significance and far-reaching historical importance for further stabilizing the national situation, upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China, maintaining the unity of the whole Party and the Party with the people of all nationalities, and continuing to steadfastly implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

The meeting endorsed the report by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, "On the Errors Committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Turmoil," and endorsed the decision of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to remove Comrade Zhao Ziyang from all his Party positions and to continue his investigation. The meeting supported the adjustments made by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to some members of the central leadership, and supported the new leadership collective of the CPC Central Committee headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin. The meeting firmly believed that this leadership collective would be able to unite and lead the people of all nationalities across the country to continue to advance steadily along the road of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The meeting pointed out that the political turmoil that had occurred recently in Beijing and some other places, and the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, aimed to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. The delegates at the meeting expressed great indignation at the reactionary plots and counter-revolutionary actions of a very few people, and great outrage at Comrade Zhao Ziyang's support for the turmoil and the split in the Party at a critical moment. The meeting held that the decisions and major measures taken by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council in this serious political struggle were necessary and correct, and were supported by the people of all nationalities across the country. In the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police made great contributions. They are truly the iron wall of the socialist People's Republic of China and the strong pillar of people's democratic dictatorship.

The meeting highly praised the major role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in this struggle. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's recent important speeches are the most powerful ideological weapons for understanding this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, and are programmatic documents on the current situation and our country's future tasks. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's proposal to maintain the consistency of our country's development strategy and the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is very necessary and correct. We must continue to take economic construction as the center, consistently adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles as the foundation of the state, and steadfastly follow the path of reform and opening up to build a strong country.

The meeting strongly condemned the anti-China wave instigated by certain reactionary forces in the West. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and we will not allow any country to interfere in our internal affairs. The Chinese people will never yield to any external pressure. Our country will continue to adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace and an open policy, and on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, continue to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world and contribute to the maintenance of world peace.

The meeting required that all levels of the People's Political Consultative Conference and its members should, in light of the severe facts of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, seriously study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches, and unite their thoughts with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches. They should fully utilize the advantage of the People's Political Consultative Conference in widely connecting with people from all walks of life at home and abroad, unite all forces that can be united, and assist the Party and the government in doing well the following four major tasks: thoroughly stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, strictly distinguishing between the two different types of contradictions, and further stabilizing the national political situation; continuing to do a good job in rectification, reform and opening up, and promoting sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development; earnestly strengthening ideological and political work, and striving to carry out education on patriotism, socialism, independence, self-reliance, hard struggle, thrift, and building the country, and resolutely opposing bourgeois liberalization; and vigorously strengthening the construction of democracy and the legal system, resolutely punishing corruption, and resolutely punishing official malfeasance. They should continue to hold high the banner of socialism and patriotism, adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, adhere to the principle of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," "sharing weal and woe," and "sharing joys and sorrows," and unite as one, actively carry out political consultation and democratic supervision, and do a good job in all aspects of work to make new contributions to the rejuvenation of China and the unification of the motherland.

    会议赞同李鹏同志代表中共中央政治局提出的《关于赵紫阳同志在反党反社会主义的动乱中所犯错误的报告》，赞同中共十三届四中全会关于撤销赵紫阳同志党内一切职务，并对他继续进行审查的决定；会议拥护中共十三届四中全会对中央领导机构的部分成员进行的调整，拥护以江泽民同志为总书记的中共中央新的领导集体。会议坚信，这个领导集体一定能够团结和带领全国各族人民，坚定地沿着建设有中国特色的社会主义道路继续前进。
    会议指出，最近以来在北京和一些地方发生的政治动乱以及在北京发生的反革命暴乱，其目的是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。与会委员对于极少数人的这种反动图谋和反革命行径表示极大的愤慨，对于赵紫阳同志在关键时刻支持动乱和分裂党的行为表示极大的义愤。会议认为，中共中央和国务院在这场严肃的政治斗争中作出的决策和采取的一系列重大措施，都是必要的和正确的，得到了全国各族人民的拥护。在平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警作出了巨大贡献，他们不愧为社会主义的中华人民共和国的钢铁长城，不愧为人民民主专政的坚强柱石。
    会议高度评价了以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家在这场斗争中所发挥的重大作用。邓小平同志最近的几次重要讲话，是认识这场动乱和反革命暴乱的最有力的思想武器，是关于目前形势和我们国家今后任务的纲领性文件。邓小平同志提出的保持我们国家的发展战略和中共十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策的一贯性，是非常必要和正确的。我们要继续以经济建设为中心，始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则这个立国之本，坚定不移地走好改革开放的强国之路。
    会议强烈谴责西方某些反动势力挑起的反华浪潮。我们不干涉任何国家的内政，也决不允许任何国家干涉我国的内政。中国人民决不会屈服于任何外来的压力。我们国家将始终不渝地坚持独立自主的和平外交政策和对外开放政策，在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续同世界各国发展友好关系，为维护世界和平做出贡献。
    会议要求，人民政协的各级组织和政协委员，要联系动乱和反革命暴乱的严峻事实，认真学习中共十三届四中全会的文件和邓小平同志的重要讲话，把思想统一到中共十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志重要讲话上来。要充分发挥人民政协广泛联系海内外各方面群众和各界人士的优势，团结一切可以团结的力量，协助党和政府做好当前的四件大事：彻底制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，进一步稳定全国政治局势；继续搞好治理整顿、改革开放和促进经济持续、稳定、协调的发展；认真加强思想政治工作，努力开展爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、自力更生、艰苦奋斗、勤俭建国的教育，坚决反对资产阶级自由化；大力加强民主法制建设，坚决惩治腐败，坚决惩治官倒。要继续高举社会主义和爱国主义的旗帜，坚持共产党领导的多党合作和政治协商制度，坚持共产党与各民主党派“长期共存、互相监督”，“肝胆相照、荣辱与共”的方针，振奋精神，团结一致，积极开展政治协商和民主监督，做好各项工作，为振兴中华、统一祖国作出新的贡献。
