"The Creation of 'Sing a Mountain Song for the Party to Hear'"

"Sing a Mountain Song for the Party to Hear" is a miner's poem that Lei Feng copied into his diary as a reminder of the hardships of the old society, to remember the Party's kindness, and to spur himself on to greater efforts. In 1963, Lei Feng unfortunately died in the line of duty. That same year, the Shanghai musician Zhu Jian'er discovered this poem in "Lei Feng's Diary" and set it to music. It quickly spread throughout the country and became a beloved song of the people.

This folk song was created in the spring of 1958 by Yao Xiaozhou, who was then working at the Jiaoping Coal Mine in the Tongchuan Mining Bureau in Shaanxi. During a miners' discussion comparing past and present, he heard a miner sing: "The brightest is the sun in the sky, the dearest are one's own parents; the sun's light doesn't reach down to our mine, parents' love can't stop the beatings and scoldings. The mine is home, the Party is mother; in the old society, I suffered endless hardships, but the Party came and I laughed heartily." This deeply moved the young Yao Xiaozhou. He immediately rewrote it into a folk song. The initial draft included the line "In the old society, we suffered hardships, and our mothers could only shed tears," which was not easy to recite and the meaning was unclear. He took the lyrics to the miners for their opinions. An old miner suggested changing it to "In the old society, the whip lashed my body, and my mother could only shed tears." Yao Xiaozhou was inspired by this suggestion. He adopted the old miner's advice, revised the draft, and titled it "Sing a Mountain Song for the Party to Hear," expressing the sentiments of millions of people. The work was first published in the 1960 issue of "Shaanxi Literature," under the pseudonym Jiaoping. In 1962, this work was included in "Three Hundred New Folk Songs" by Chunfeng Literature and Arts Publishing House. In 1964, Zhu Jian'er wrote a letter to the Party Secretary of the Jiaoping Coal Mine in Tongchuan Mining Bureau, asking him to forward the letter to Jiaoping. However, the Party Secretary did not know who Jiaoping was, so he held a meeting to find him. After several twists and turns, the letter finally reached Yao Xiaozhou. Thus, starting from 1964, the song "Sing a Mountain Song for the Party to Hear" finally had the author's real name.

    《唱支山歌给党听》创作始末
    《唱支山歌给党听》是一首矿工诗，雷锋曾把它抄在日记里，作为不忘旧社会的苦难，牢记党的恩情，鞭策自己奋勇前进的座右铭。1963年，雷锋不幸因公牺牲，同年，上海音乐家朱践耳从《雷锋日记》中发现这首诗，便为它谱成曲，很快在全国流传开来，成为亿万人民喜爱的歌。
    这首民歌，是在1958年春由姚晓舟创作的，当时他在陕西铜川矿务局焦坪煤矿工作。在一次矿工今昔对比座谈会上，他听到一个矿工唱出：“最亮的是天上的太阳，最亲的是自己的爹娘；太阳亮照不到咱井下，爹娘亲免不了挨打骂。矿是家，党是妈；旧社会我受尽苦和难，党来了我才笑哈哈。”这使年轻的姚晓舟深受感动。因此，他立即把它改写成一首民歌。初稿出来后，其中有“旧社会我们受苦难，母亲只会泪淋淋”，念起来既不顺口，含意又不明确，他把歌词拿到矿工中去征求意见。有个老矿工建议改成“旧社会鞭子抽我身，母亲只会泪淋淋”。姚晓舟听后，深受启迪。于是，就采用了老矿工的意见，将稿子作了修改，并题名为《唱支山歌给党听》，唱出了亿万人民的心声。作品最初发表在1960年《陕西文艺》上，署名蕉萍。1962年此作品被春风文艺出版社收入《新民歌三百首》。1964年朱践耳写信给蕉萍所在铜川矿务局焦坪煤矿党委书记，请他将信转交给蕉萍，可是党委书记也不知道蕉萍是谁，便召开大会寻找。几经周折，那封信才转到姚晓舟的手里。于是，从1964年起，《唱支山歌给党听》这首歌曲才注上了作者的真名实姓。
