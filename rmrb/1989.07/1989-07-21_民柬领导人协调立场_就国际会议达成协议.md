	Khmer Rouge leaders coordinate positions to reach agreement on international conference

	Paris, July 21 (Xinhua) — Prince Sihanouk held a press conference in Paris today, representing the three leaders of the Cambodian resistance movement and the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, to deliver an important speech regarding the upcoming international conference on the Cambodian issue.

	Prince Sihanouk said that he recently met with Deputy Prime Minister of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, Khieu Samphan, and Prime Minister Son Sann in Paris. The three parties reached agreements on several issues related to the Paris International Conference on Cambodia through discussions. At today's press conference, several documents jointly signed by Sihanouk, Son Sann, and Khieu Samphan were distributed. These documents include the principles of the draft constitution of Cambodia, the issue of Cambodia's temporary status, and several views on the memorandum proposed by France for the Paris International Conference on Cambodia.

	The three leaders believe that the essence of the Cambodian issue is the invasion and occupation by Vietnam. The Paris International Conference should aim to achieve the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and all military forces under various names under the supervision of the United Nations, in order to maintain Cambodia's peace, independence, sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law. The Paris International Conference should study and mobilize the international community to guarantee the fundamental resolution of the Cambodian issue from all aspects. The three leaders also pointed out that they hold reservations regarding the so-called "unanimously adopted" resolutions of the previous Jakarta meeting. They reiterated that the five-point proposal recently put forward by Prince Sihanouk is the only correct principle for resolving the Cambodian issue.

	In response to a reporter's question, Sihanouk said that he would meet with Hun Sen of the Phnom Penh regime in Paris on July 24, followed by a round-table conference of the four Cambodian parties.

	The International Conference on Cambodia is scheduled to be held in Paris from July 30 to September 5.

    民柬领导人协调立场
    就国际会议达成协议
    本报巴黎7月21日电　记者吕网大、张启华报道：西哈努克亲王今天在巴黎举行记者招待会，代表柬埔寨抵抗运动和民柬联合政府三方领导人就即将召开的柬埔寨问题国际会议发表了重要讲话。
    西哈努克亲王说，他最近在巴黎会见了民柬政府副主席乔森潘、政府总理宋双，三方通过讨论就有关柬埔寨巴黎国际会议涉及的几个问题达成了协议。在今天的记者招待会上，散发了由西哈努克、宋双、乔森潘联合签名的几项文件，即关于柬埔寨宪法草案的原则；柬埔寨临时地位的问题；关于法国提出的柬埔寨巴黎国际会议备忘录的几点看法。
    三位领导人认为，柬埔寨问题的实质是越南的入侵和占领。巴黎国际会议应实现在联合国监督下，撤出越南军队以及在各种名义下存在的越南军事力量的目的，以便在遵守联合国宪章和国际法的基础上，维护柬埔寨的和平、独立、主权、中立和领土的完整。巴黎国际会议应从各方面研究，动员国际社会作出保证，从根本上解决柬埔寨问题。三位领导人还指出，他们对上次雅加达会议达成的所谓“一致通过”的决议持保留态度。他们重申，西哈努克亲王不久前提出的五点建议是解决柬埔寨问题唯一正确的原则。
    西哈努克在回答记者提问时说，他将于本月24日在巴黎会见金边政权的洪森，然后举行柬埔寨四方圆桌会议。
  柬埔寨问题国际会议定于7月30日至9月5日在巴黎举行。
