Afghan Forces Engage in Rocket Warfare; Rebels Attack Presidential Palace and Soviet Embassy
U.S. Envoy Urges Soviet Union to Halt Military Aid to Afghanistan

ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) — According to local newspapers and foreign news agencies, following the recent battle for Jalalabad, Afghan rebel forces have frequently launched rocket attacks on Kabul. The Kabul government troops have retaliated with rocket fire.

Reports indicate that in recent days, the seven-party alliance of Afghan rebels has fired nearly 100 rockets at Kabul. On July 10 alone, Kabul was hit by 19 rockets, resulting in approximately 30 deaths and many injuries. A government ammunition depot was also set ablaze. This day saw the highest number of casualties in months and marked the first time a military target had been hit in a long time.

Additionally, it was reported that on July 6, Afghan rebels attacked the presidential office in Kabul, known as the Darulaman Palace, and the Soviet Embassy. Sources indicate that 22 officials of the Kabul regime and 8 Soviet embassy staff members were killed in the attack.

The Kabul government troops have also launched rocket counterattacks against the rebels. In recent days, the targets of the government's rocket fire have been twofold: the rebel bases and the offices of the seven-party alliance's provisional government within Afghan territory.

ISLAMABAD, July 11 (Xinhua) — U.S. Special Envoy to the Afghan Resistance Forces, Tomson, on July 10 called on the Soviet Union to halt military aid to the Kabul regime.

Experts from the U.S. and the Soviet Union will hold talks in Stockholm on July 31 to discuss the resolution of the Afghan issue.
