	The New Square in Hohhot Has Become a Large Gambling Den
	When Will the Relevant Authorities Take Action?

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 23rd — (Reporter Tang Ji) In recent days, the reporter observed over 100 gambling stalls in the New Square of Hohhot at night, attracting tens of thousands of people to watch and participate in various gambling activities. This venue, which is supposed to host large-scale gatherings and celebrations, has unfortunately turned into a massive gambling den.

	The gambling activities here are diverse. Some use glass marbles and playing cards, while others bet on billiards. Most participants are young people in their twenties, with stakes ranging from one yuan to tens of yuan per game. The stall owners take a commission of one yuan per game, regardless of the bet amount. The reporter estimated that there are dozens of billiard gambling spots alone in the square.

	The most eye-catching gambling activity involves using cigarettes, rings, and ceramics as bait. Participants stand about two meters away and use bamboo rings to try and hook the items. Each bamboo ring costs one jiao, and whatever is hooked can be taken away. Most participants in this game are children. At that moment, the reporter saw a young man arguing with the stall owner. The young man had thrown 10 bamboo rings, with one ring partially covering a wine jug. He claimed he had hooked it, but the stall owner disagreed. The young man asked, "Why doesn't it count?" The stall owner replied, "I set the rules when I run the stall." The young man attempted to take the wine jug by force, but the stall owner called over three accomplices, who beat the young man until his face was bruised and swollen.

	Seeing this vibrant and lively square, once adorned with fountains, now desecrated by mass gambling activities, many people lamented: Why don't the relevant authorities come and take action?

    呼市新华广场成了大赌场
    有关部门啥时来管一管
    据新华社呼和浩特7月23日电　（记者汤计）几天来，记者在夜幕下的呼和浩特新华广场，看到100多个赌摊，吸引着上万人观看和参与各种赌博活动。这个举行大型集会和庆祝活动的场所，竟成了大赌场。
  这里的赌博活动花样繁多。有的用玻璃球、扑克牌赌博。有的打台球赌博。参加这种赌博活动的多是20岁左右的青年，一次输赢一元至十几元不等。摊主不管赌方赌资多少，每次抽一元彩头。记者粗略统计，广场上仅用台球搞赌博的就有几十处。
    最能障人眼目的赌博活动，是以香烟、戒指、瓷器等物为诱饵，让人站在2米多远的地方用竹圈套，每个竹圈一角钱，套住什么就拿走什么。玩这种赌博游戏的多是儿童。就在这时，记者看到一个青年同摊主争吵起来，这个青年扔了10个竹圈，有一个竹圈大半部分压在一把酒壶上。他说套上了，摊主说不算。青年说：“为什么不算？”摊主说：“我摆摊，规矩由我定。”那个青年想强行拿走酒壶，摊主一声招呼，叫来三个同伙，一顿拳打脚踢，把这个青年打得鼻青脸肿。
    看到这花团锦簇、泉水喷涌的广场，被聚众赌博活动糟踏成这样，不少人感慨地说：有关部门为啥不来管一管呢？
