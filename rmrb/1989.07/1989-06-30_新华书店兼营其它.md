	New Bookstores Also Sell Other Items

	In Wuhan City, several New Bookstores have signs from related factories or advertisements for other products in front of their doors. Some sell general goods, some sell medicine, some sell sports equipment, and some even sell fruit, making it unclear whether these are bookstores or general stores.

	The New Bookstores on Wuchang Avenue and Jianghan Road in Hankou, as well as the New Bookstore on Simenkou in Wuchang and the Foreign Language Bookstore next to the newly built Zhongnan Commercial Building, are all like this (see picture).

	As a socialist cultural propaganda enterprise, New Bookstores should prioritize social benefits. If economic benefits are not good, efforts should be focused on improving management levels and serving readers in every possible way, rather than diverting attention to operating other businesses.

    新华书店兼营其它
    武汉市有几家新华书店，门前挂起有关厂家的牌子或张贴经营商品的广告。有兼营百货的，医药的，有兼营体育用品的，还有兼营水果的，叫人弄不清这里究竟是书店，还是综合商店。
    汉口武圣路、江汉路新华书店是这样，武昌司门口新华书店和新建的中南商业大楼旁的外文书店也是这样（见图）。
    新华书店作为社会主义的文化宣传企业，首先要重视社会效益。如果经济效益不景气，就应在提高经营管理水平、千方百计为读者服务上下功夫，不应把心思用到兼营其它业务上。
