Premier Li Meets with Prince Sihanouk

Premier Li Peng Expresses China's Continued Support for the Just Cause of the Khmer Resistance Against Vietnam

Prince Sihanouk Emphasizes the Need for a Four-Party Coalition Government and the Complete Withdrawal of Vietnamese Troops from Cambodia

BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) — Reporter Wen Xian: Premier Li Peng met with Prince Norodom Sihanouk, Chairman of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK), and his wife this afternoon at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse. Both sides had an in-depth exchange of views on the Cambodian issue.

Prince Sihanouk first emphasized that the international supervision mechanism for the Cambodian issue should not be established by an international conference but should be organized by the United Nations, with the United Nations dispatching an international peacekeeping force. Otherwise, there would be no guarantee.

Sihanouk said that after Vietnam withdraws its troops from Cambodia in September this year, it will still leave 30,000 Vietnamese soldiers in the Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) forces led by Son Sann, and there will still be 100,000 Vietnamese soldiers mixed in the local militias. In addition, there are 1 million Vietnamese immigrants in Cambodia. After Vietnam withdraws its troops, if a war breaks out in Cambodia, it will not be a civil war but a continuation of the struggle against Vietnam. The withdrawal of Vietnamese troops does not mean the resolution of the Cambodian issue.

He said that some countries propose to establish governments for both Sihanouk and Hun Sen, but I disagree. A four-party coalition government must be established, with both the government and the military consisting of four parties. The military of each party should not exceed 10,000. Hun Sen has only made superficial changes to the constitution of the Phnom Penh regime, and the entire system remains unchanged, still controlled by Hun Sen's party. Asking me to serve as the head of state would essentially mean being under their control, which I cannot accept. I cannot use my good reputation to serve them. He emphasized that the governments of the CGDK and Phnom Penh must be dissolved simultaneously to establish a four-party coalition government. I cannot give up my ideals. Cambodia must achieve 100% independence. Vietnamese troops must truly withdraw from Cambodia. We will continue to fight until Vietnam stops its aggression against Cambodia.

Premier Li Peng stated that China's stance in supporting the three factions of the CGDK in resisting Vietnamese aggression will not change. Although we are currently facing temporary difficulties, China will continue to support the just cause of the Khmer resistance against Vietnam. The core of the Cambodian issue remains that Vietnam must truly withdraw all its armed forces from Cambodia under strict, effective, and fair international supervision. The prince's proposal for the United Nations to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops is reasonable. China agrees with the prince's analysis that the Vietnamese army is staying in Cambodia in disguise, which is a trick played by Vietnam. This move by Vietnam will be a significant threat to peace in Cambodia. We support the prince's principled stance on this issue and hope that the international community will expose this problem.

Li Peng said that currently, there are attempts internationally to form a coalition of Sihanouk and Hun Sen. I fully support the prince's stance against forming a two-party coalition. A two-party coalition would be a false coalition, not a true one, and its essence would be the one-party rule of Vietnam and Hun Sen. China continues to support the establishment of a four-party provisional coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk, that is, the national unity government proposed by the prince, and then hold elections under international supervision. We believe this is the only way to resolve the Cambodian issue.

    李总理会见西哈努克亲王
    李鹏表示中国仍将一如既往地支持民柬抗越的正义事业
    西哈努克强调建立四方联合政府越军必须真正从柬撤走
    本报北京7月5日讯　记者温宪报道：国务院总理李鹏今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆会见了民柬主席西哈努克亲王和夫人，双方就柬埔寨问题深入地交换了意见。
    西哈努克亲王首先强调说，关于柬埔寨问题的国际监督机制，不能由国际会议来建立，而应由联合国来组织，由联合国派遣国际维持和平部队，否则就没有保证。
    西哈努克说，越南今年9月从柬埔寨撤军后，它还将在韩桑林的军队中留下3万名越南士兵，在韩桑林的民兵中还将混有10万名越南士兵。此外，还有100万越南移民在柬埔寨。越南撤军以后，柬埔寨如果发生战争，那将不是内战，而是抗越斗争的继续。越南撤军并不意味着柬埔寨问题的解决。
    他说，有些国家提出要建立西哈努克、洪森两方政府，我不同意。必须建立四方联合政府，政府和军队都应是四方。各方的军队不能超出10000人。洪森对金边政权的宪法只做了一些表面的修改，整个制度没有改变，仍然是由洪森的党控制。让我去当元首，实质上仍受他们的控制，对此我不能接受。我不能用我的好名声来为他们服务。他强调说，必须同时解散民柬政府和金边政府，建立四方联合政府。我不能放弃理想。柬埔寨必须获得百分之百的独立。越南军队必须真正从柬埔寨撤出。我们将一直斗争到越南停止侵略柬埔寨为止。
    李鹏总理表示，中国支持民柬三方抵抗越南侵略的立场不会改变。尽管目前我们遇到了暂时的困难，中国仍将一如既往地支持民柬抗越的正义事业。柬埔寨问题的核心仍然是越南必须在严格、有效、公正的国际监督下真正地从柬埔寨撤出一切武装力量。亲王提出由联合国来监督越南撤军，这是合理的。中国同意亲王刚才分析的越南军队在变相地留在柬埔寨，这是越南在玩弄花招。越南此举对柬埔寨的和平将是很大的隐患。我们支持亲王在这个问题上的原则立场，希望国际社会揭露这个问题。
    李鹏说，目前，国际上有人企图搞西哈努克、洪森两方联合。我非常赞成亲王反对搞两方联合的立场。两方联合将是假联合，不是真联合，其实质是越南、洪森搞一方统治。中国继续支持建立以西哈努克亲王为首的四方临时联合政府，也就是亲王提出的民族团结政府，然后在国际监督下进行大选。我们认为这是解决柬埔寨问题的唯一出路。
