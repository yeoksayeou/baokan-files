To the Editor,

I am a student who studied at Tsinghua University for eight years and am now studying at the University of Cambridge in the UK. The recent turmoil in China has drawn my considerable attention. My colleagues and friends in the UK all believe that this turmoil has destroyed our country's investment environment and international image, causing great losses to the nation and its people. For such a serious incident, I believe it is essential to investigate its root causes to eliminate potential future problems.

Through my eight years of study at Tsinghua University, I have some understanding of the current thoughts of university students. I believe that the fundamental cause of this turmoil lies in the rampant spread of bourgeois liberalization and the plotting and incitement by a small group of anti-party and anti-socialist elements. We have criticized bourgeois liberalization in the past, but our criticism was not thorough enough, allowing it to continue to spread. By comparing the ideological state of students in the early 1980s with that of the later 1980s, as well as some phenomena within the campus, one can see this clearly.

When I first entered Tsinghua in 1980, we had two political study sessions every week, organized by the Party branch and the Communist Youth League branch respectively. Additionally, current events and speeches by revolutionary leaders were often included as compulsory courses. But now, who pays attention to political study? Who organizes these activities? Back then, each class had a dedicated instructor for political and ideological education, who would frequently communicate with students, promptly addressing our ideological confusion and difficulties. But now, who can still see these instructors?

In the past, our clothing was always proper and dignified, befitting students. Men did not expose their chests, and women did not show their knees. But now, students think it's open-minded to dress more revealingly. Skirts are getting shorter, and tops are getting lower. In the past, it was rare to see couples holding hands in Tsinghua's campus. Those who were in love would go to secluded places. But now, couples openly embrace in broad daylight. Many students start dating as soon as they enter college, seeking emotional comfort. How many people still focus on their studies? How many people still talk about the great ideals and aspirations of communism?

In the past, we often organized voluntary labor. Students cultivated a love for the working people through labor, striving to overcome petty-bourgeois ideas in their minds. But now, when labor is mentioned, money is demanded. Money has become the sole pursuit of many students.

There are too many such examples, and these cannot be said to have no relation to today's turmoil. This is the result of our neglect of ideological education work. I remember when we were young, we all thought that life in a socialist society was very happy. Now that living standards have improved, people are dissatisfied. Isn't this a reflection of our improper propaganda and education? Now, many students blindly admire Western material civilization. In fact, there are many poor people in the West. Propaganda should be comprehensive and have a correct purpose. In the future, people should also be able to understand the suffering and misery of the poor in the West.

I believe that in our country, after the elimination of the exploiting class, class struggle still exists to a certain extent. There are still a small number of class enemies who attempt to overthrow the Party and the government. Vicious bourgeois ideas from the West are also corrupting some of our weak-willed individuals. In this era of reform and opening up, we must not abandon the concept of class struggle and must adhere to the four cardinal principles.

Finally, I would like to say that our Party is the Party of the people, and our government is the government of the people. The Party Central Committee's decision to focus on modernizing the economy is a wise decision. As a large country like ours, only with a prosperous economy and political independence can we truly stand tall in the world. Therefore, our most fundamental task at present is, under the leadership of the Party and the government, in a stable and united environment, to focus on economic construction with one heart and one mind. We must believe that the Party and the government will surely overcome various corrupt phenomena on the road ahead and continuously promote the process of democratization. Our Party has so many old comrades who have gone through the Long March, and they are still working day and night to better grasp the direction of the country's development. What are they striving for? We young people should truly reflect on this.

Yours sincerely,
Wei Min
Chinese Student at the University of Cambridge

### 剑桥大学一名中国留学生的来信

    剑桥大学一名中国留学生的来信编辑同志：
    我是一个在清华大学学习了八年的学生，现在英国剑桥大学学习。前一段时间，国内发生的动乱引起了我极大的关注。我同英国的同事、朋友都认为，这次动乱毁坏了我国的投资环境和国际形象，给国家和人民带来了极大的损失。对于如此严重的事件，我认为一定要深究其根源，以消除后患。
    通过在清华大学学习的八年，我觉得对现在大学生的思想是有些了解的。这次动乱的根本原因在于资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，在于一小撮反党反社会主义的人在背后策划、煽动。对于资产阶级自由化，过去我们批判过，但很不彻底，导致了其继续泛滥。简单比较一下80年代初期和后期学生的思想状况和校园内的一些现象，可以发现这一点。
    1980年我刚进清华时，每周都有两次政治学习，由党支部和团支部分别组织。此外，还常把时事政治、革命前辈的讲话等当必修课来学习。可现在的学生还有谁理睬政治学习呢？还有谁组织这些活动呢？那时每个班都设有专门负责政治思想教育的辅导员，经常和同学们交流思想，及时解决我们思想上的困惑和难题，可现在谁还能见到这些辅导员的面呢？
    过去我们的衣着都严肃得体，符合学生的身份，男不露胸，女不显膝。可现在的学生认为开放了，女生的胸开得越来越低，裙幅越来越短。过去清华校园很少看到男女生手拉手散步的，谈恋爱的极少，即便有也是到不显眼的角落。可现在光天化日之下，男女生就搂搂抱抱，很多学生一进校就谈恋爱，以寻求感情上的寄托。还有多少人专心读书，有多少人讲远大的共产主义理想和抱负呢？
    过去我们常组织些义务劳动，学生们通过参加劳动培养热爱劳动人民的思想和作风，注意克服头脑中的小资产阶级思想。可现在一提劳动就要钱，钱成了不少学生追求的唯一目标。
    诸如这样的事例太多了，这些都不能说与今天的动乱毫无关系。这是我们轻视思想教育工作的结果。记得小时候，我们都认为生活在社会主义中很幸福。现在生活水平提高了，大家反而不满了。这不正是我们的宣传教育不得当的反映吗？现在，不少学生盲目地崇拜西方的物质文明，其实西方的穷人也很多。宣传应是全面的，有正确目的的，今后应让人们也能了解西方的穷人阶层的痛苦和不幸。
    我认为，在我国，剥削阶级作为阶级消灭以后，阶级斗争还在一定范围内长期存在。现在仍有一小撮妄图推翻党和政府的阶级敌人，西方的资产阶级腐朽思想也正在侵蚀着我们的一些意志薄弱者。在对外开放搞活的今天，尤其不能放弃阶级斗争观念，更应坚持四项基本原则。
    最后我要说，我们的党是人民的党，我们的政府是人民的政府。把现阶段的主要任务定为进行现代化经济建设，是党中央的英明决策。作为我们这样一个大国，只有经济繁荣昌盛，政治独立自主，才能真正地屹立于世界之林。所以，我们目前最根本的任务，是在党和政府的领导下，在安定团结的环境下，一心一意、同心同德搞好经济建设。我们要相信党和政府定会克服眼前前进道路中出现的各种腐败现象，不断地推进民主化进程的。我们党有那么多长征过的老同志，为了更好地把握国家发展的方向，仍在日夜操劳着。他们图的是什么呢？我们这些年轻人真应该好好地反思啊。
