Since late June, the hometown of the three "Guardians of the Republic" — Wang Qifu, Li Dongguo, and Xu Rujun — in Jiashan County, Anhui Province, has extensively launched activities to "learn from, love, and support the People's Liberation Army." The county has been actively working on supporting military families and dependents.

The county's Civil Affairs Bureau and Zilaqiao Township allocated a special fund, while township party members and cadres led the way by donating over 3,000 yuan. They purchased daily necessities for the family of martyr Wang Qifu and are preparing to build three new rooms for his family. Additionally, ten core militia members from the village volunteered to do farm work for Wang Qifu's family. The county's Civil Affairs Bureau and the People's Armed Forces Department learned that over 200 local soldiers were on duty in Beijing for martial law enforcement. They organized 353 "Supporting Soldiers" and "Sending Warmth" teams to assist the families of these soldiers with summer harvesting, planting, and drought relief.

    嘉山掀起拥军热
    本报讯　六月下旬以来，王其富、李栋国、徐如军三位“共和国卫士”的家乡——安徽省嘉山县，广泛开展“学习、热爱、支持解放军”活动，切实做好拥军优属工作。
    县民政局和自来桥乡专门拿出一笔经费，区乡党员干部又带头捐款三千多元，为烈士王其富家添制了生活用品，并准备为他家盖三间新房；村里十名基干民兵还义务为王其富家做农活。县民政局和人民武装部了解到有二百多名本县籍官兵在北京执行戒严任务，组织了三百五十三个“帮战友”、“送温暖”小组，帮助官兵家庭夏收夏种，抗旱保苗。
