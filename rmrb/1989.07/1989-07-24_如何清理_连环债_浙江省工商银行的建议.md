With the tightening of bank credit, the problem of enterprise cash shortages has become more pronounced. Many enterprises either owe each other for goods or have long-term overdue bank loans that they cannot repay, forming "chain debts." Since the beginning of this year, to help enterprises get out of their cash difficulties and reduce "chain debts," banks have done a lot of work and achieved some results, but there are still many problems.

Some financial experts predict that in the coming period, the macroeconomic tightening policy will continue to be implemented, and the contradiction of insufficient social funds will remain prominent. If effective measures are not taken, enterprises' overdue loans will cause a chain reaction, which will have adverse effects on the national economy. Recently, the author interviewed colleagues from the Zhejiang Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, who suggested the following measures for clearing debts.

Banks should actively assist enterprises in collecting public funds. Banks have a wide range of contacts and are relatively familiar with the financial situation and advantages of enterprises. Credit officers assisting enterprises in collecting overdue payments can be effective. A credit officer in Hangzhou once went north to Lanzhou and south to Fuzhou with colleagues from the Hangzhou Oxygen Machine Factory, using various methods, including legal means, to recover nearly 10 million yuan in overdue loans, easing the enterprise's cash shortage.

Launch a nationwide debt clearing campaign. Overdue loans involve provinces, both within and outside the system. Only by taking joint action nationwide, breaking regional and sectoral boundaries, and gradually clearing debts from easy to difficult, can we achieve results. For cross-system overdue loans, the central bank must take the lead.

The state should allocate a portion of special "start-up" funds. In a situation where credit is tight, various specialized banks often lack funds to solve even normal procurement funds and production loans for people's livelihood necessities, let alone allocate additional funds for clearing overdue loans. With "start-up" funds, some chain debts can be alleviated, and the debt crisis can be eased. Using the method of watering the roots of a tree, providing necessary funds to "downstream" industries, and using their output to relieve "upstream" enterprises. Clear one, solve a series.

Credit funds should be supplied according to the state's industrial policy requirements, in order of priority, with a focus on support, and not a "one-size-fits-all" approach. Large and medium-sized enterprises with good economic benefits should not be the focus of tightening. Tightening should force inferior enterprises to go bankrupt, freeing up funds to solve the difficulties of advantageous enterprises, and having to give up in order to keep.

Accelerate settlement reforms, promote various types of bill business, and make enterprise commercial credit bills. At the same time, settlement discipline must be strengthened. No bank should accumulate settlement vouchers. It is necessary to ensure timely remittance and payment, ensure smooth settlement, and accelerate fund turnover.

    如何清理“连环债”
    ——浙江省工商银行的建议
    陈志红
    随着银行信贷的紧缩，企业资金短缺问题更加突出。不少企业或相互拖欠货款，或长期占压银行贷款无力偿还，形成“连环债”。今年初以来，为了帮助企业摆脱资金困境，减少“连环债”，银行做了大量工作，取得了一定成效，但目前仍存在不少问题。
    一些金融界人士预测，今后一段时期，宏观紧缩政策将会继续贯彻下去，社会资金供不应求的矛盾依然突出。若不采取积极有效的措施，企业拖欠贷款形成连锁反应，将给国民经济带来不利影响。前不久，笔者采访了浙江省工商银行的同志，他们认为可以考虑以下清理措施。
    银行主动协助企业催讨公款。银行具有接触面广，对企业财务情况和优势比较了解，由信贷员协助企业一起催讨欠款，收效较好。杭州市一信贷员，曾多次与杭州制氧机厂的同志一起北上兰州、南下福州，采用多种办法，甚至法律手段，收回拖欠贷款近千万元，缓解了企业资金紧缺的局面。
    开展全国性的清欠工作。拖欠贷款涉及到省内、省外，系统内、系统外，只有在全国范围联合行动，打破地区、块块界线、打破工、商贷款规模界线，先易后难，逐步清理，才能收效。对跨系统的拖欠，必须由中央银行牵头才行。
    国家应拨出一部分专项“启动”资金。在银根抽紧的情况下，各专业银行资金紧缺往往连正常的收购资金、人民生活必需品的生产贷款也解决不了，更谈不上另外拿出一块资金用于清理拖欠。有了“启动”资金，则可疏通部分连环债，缓解债务危机。采用浇树浇根法，给“下游”产业以必要的资金支持，以其产出松解“上游”企业。清理一点，解决一串。
    信贷资金供应按照国家产业政策要求，依次排队，重点支持，不搞“一刀切”。经济效益好的大中型企业不应成为紧缩的重点。紧缩应迫使劣等企业破产，腾出资金解决优势企业的困难，有所舍才能有所保。
    加快结算改革，广泛推广各种票据业务，使企业的商业信用票据化。同时要加强结算纪律，任何银行不得积压结算凭证，要保证汇款及时解付，保证结算畅通，以期加快资金周转。
