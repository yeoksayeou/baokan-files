Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 10th.

The State Council issued a notice today, requiring all regions to focus on the prevention and control of autumn grain and cotton crop pests and diseases to ensure a bumper harvest for the year.

The notice states that this year, China's summer grain and oil crops have seen a bumper harvest, marking a good start for the year's agricultural production. Nationwide, the autumn grain and cotton production is crucial. According to relevant departments, it is predicted that this autumn, grain and cotton pests and diseases will occur at a moderate to high level. The pests and diseases affecting cotton and rice will come early and be severe, and must be given high attention.

Therefore, the notice points out that all levels of people's governments must continue to strengthen leadership in agricultural production and ensure effective measures are implemented. The agricultural production materials coordination leading groups at all levels must, under the leadership of the respective governments, actively coordinate and seriously implement the plans for the production, import, supply, and transfer of pesticides. Efforts must be made to promote the integration of agricultural technology services with pesticide use, reduce waste, and improve efficiency. Regions with pesticide transfer tasks must adopt a national perspective, prioritize the execution of plans for pesticides as disaster relief materials, and support other regions.

The notice requires that all levels of agricultural supply departments must fully utilize existing inventory and imported pesticides that have already arrived, ensuring timely supply to regions affected by pests and diseases. They must further implement the decision to specialize in pesticide sales, strengthen management, and strictly control price increases. Strict measures must be taken to crack down on the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard pesticides, protecting farmers' interests. Typical cases must be selected and publicly handled seriously.

The notice also requires pesticide production enterprises to strengthen management, reduce consumption, and improve product quality. Efforts must be made to produce marketable products, with a current focus on the production of organophosphorus insecticides. All levels of government must organize relevant departments to ensure the supply of raw materials and electricity for pesticide production.

    国务院发出通知要求各地
    防治秋季粮棉作物病虫害
    各级农资经营部门要及时供应农药
    新华社北京7月10日电　国务院今天发出通知，要求各地抓好秋季粮棉作物病虫害防治，夺取全年农业丰收。
    通知说，今年我国夏季粮油均获丰收，是夺取全年农业丰收的良好开端。从全国来看，秋季粮棉生产举足轻重。据有关部门预测，今年秋季粮棉病虫害中等偏重发生。棉花和水稻的病虫害来得早，来得猛，应引起高度重视。
    为此，通知指出，各级人民政府要继续加强对农业生产的领导，把工作做到实处。各级农业生产资料协调领导小组要在各级政府的领导下，积极进行协调，认真落实农药生产、进口、供应和调出调入计划。要大力推广农技服务与农药使用挂钩的科学用药经验，减少浪费，提高使用效率。有农药调出任务的地区，要树立全国一盘棋的思想，把农药当作救灾物资优先执行计划，支援其他地区。
    通知要求，各级农资经营部门要充分利用现有库存和已经到货的进口农药，不误农时地把农药供应到发生病虫害的地区；要进一步贯彻专营的决定，加强农药销售管理，严格控制价格上涨。一定要严厉打击制造和销售假劣农药的犯罪活动，保护农民利益。要选择一些典型案例，公开严肃处理。
    通知要求农药生产企业要加强管理，降低消耗，提高产品质量。要努力多生产适销对路的产品，当前特别要抓好有机磷杀虫剂的生产。各级政府要组织有关部门确保农药生产的原料、电力供应。
