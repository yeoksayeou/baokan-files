According to statistics, during the 1988-1989 sugar milling season, Xinjiang produced 118,000 tons of sugar, setting a historic high and ranking third among sugar beet production areas nationwide.

It is reported that during this sugar milling season, Xinjiang's sugar industry paid more than twice the amount of taxes compared to the previous season, reaching 50 million yuan. The tax rate per ton of sugar is among the highest in the country's sugar beet production areas.

Xinjiang is one of China's six major sugar beet production areas. The region has long hours of sunshine, fewer pests and diseases, and high sugar content in sugar beets.
