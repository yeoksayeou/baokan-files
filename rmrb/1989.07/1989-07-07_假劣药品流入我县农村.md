On April 14th, our bureau discovered 15 types of counterfeit drugs in the health clinic of Hanjia Village, Madian Township in our county, with a total value of over 8,300 yuan. Among them were commonly used injectable drugs such as Gentamicin, Kanamycin, Lincomycin, Terramycin, Compound Sulfonamides, Prednisone, and Dexamethasone.

It has been learned that since this spring, a group of counterfeit drug peddlers have been active in rural areas of places like Weifang. Many rural health clinics are using counterfeit drugs sold cheaply by these peddlers. These counterfeit drugs are generally indistinguishable from genuine ones in appearance and are often made from starch or other substitute foods. Although they do not harm patients, they often delay treatment.

It is suggested that relevant departments investigate and crack down on the production and sale of counterfeit drugs to ensure the health of the people.

    假劣药品流入我县农村
    4月14日，我局在我县马店乡韩家村卫生室查获15种假药，价值8300多元。其中，有针剂庆大霉素、卡那霉素、林可霉素、土霉素、复方新诺明、强的松、地塞米松等常用药品。
    据了解，春季以来，一批假药贩子在潍坊等地的一些农村活动猖獗，不少农村卫生室使用着假药贩子低价兜售的伪劣药品。这些假药从外观上一般难以分辨，多用淀粉或其它代用食品制成，虽然对病人无毒害作用，但往往使病人贻误治疗。
    建议有关部门查处和打击制售假冒药品活动，以保证人民群众的身体健康。
