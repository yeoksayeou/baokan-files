Among the staff and workers of the Zhuzhou City Water Supply Company in Hunan, Manager Yu Xici has a unique skill: chatting. It may sound strange, but many difficulties can be resolved when he chats with the masses. Over 60% of the company's 870 employees have had a chat with him. He can understand the concerns of his employees, whether it's about their children's education or other personal issues. He is like a magnet, attracting many employees to work happily, making the company's economic and technical indicators rank among the best in the nation.

When Yu took over as manager, the demand for water was overwhelming: citizens were waiting for water to cook, factories needed water for production; there were disputes and fights everywhere. He was at a loss on how to handle everything.

"Three people walking together must have a teacher among them." Yu went to the water tanks and machinery, seeking advice from workers and technical and management personnel. Everyone started discussing:

"Manager, you have to eat one bite at a time and handle one thing at a time. I think we should focus on water first; only with water can we have benefits!" suggested an old worker.

"Industrial water usage should be funded by the industries themselves. I think this is a good way to solve the city's water supply problem," suggested the former manager who had been transferred.

"To improve water supply, we need to raise the quality of our workforce. We should focus on training!" said Technical Director Zhu.

A relatively complete and practical plan for managing the company was "chatted" out. After that, he rushed to over a hundred factories to raise 10 million yuan. He urgently mobilized resources to lay 10 large pipelines, solving the water supply issues for over 2,000 households and enterprises, achieving a water supply rate of over 99%. The company's annual profit reached over 10 million yuan. At the same time, the company spent a large sum of money to send over 20 employees to university and invested 200,000 yuan to build a staff school, offering courses in plumbing, electrical work, and other fields, thus improving the company's technical and management levels.

On one New Year's Eve, a loud argument erupted from a staff dormitory. This was a three-generation family, and the living space was too cramped. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law argued over moving a bed, and even broke dishes. Yu heard about this and felt like his heart was being torn apart. The company had many households with similar living conditions. He talked to over 400 employees, realizing that 400 households needed better housing, 150 children needed kindergarten, and it would cost millions of yuan. There were also over 100 employees whose children needed jobs, and this couldn't be solved overnight. He discussed with everyone how to gradually solve these problems. Some suggested doing it themselves.

Soon, all the employees built five kindergartens on their own. As the company's economic conditions improved, some employees moved into new two-bedroom apartments. The employment and education issues of 158 children of employees were also gradually resolved. They also solved the problem of over 20 couples living apart. The employees also engaged in various sideline businesses like fishing, raising chickens, pigs, planting trees, and growing fruit. Seeing all this, everyone smiled, and Yu's heart felt relieved.

The average age of the company's employees is under 30, with over 70% being young people. Some of them were hired through connections, and a few had criminal records. Some of them spent their days in tea houses, drunk, with a "whatever happens, happens" attitude. Yu quietly observed them and decided to use his warm heart to warm these young people with twisted souls.

There was a young worker who had been in jail for two years and felt that his life was ruined. Yu chatted with him repeatedly, sincerely advising him, "Falling down is not the end. Get up and look forward, walk towards the bright future, and you will have great hope."

His words were sincere and heartfelt, like sweet dew and clear spring water, flowing into the young worker's heart. One summer day, a mentally ill person slashed a child multiple times and fled. Many bystanders watched, but no one stepped forward. However, he carried the severely injured child to the hospital, helped with registration, medication, and injections. When the injured child was out of danger, he quietly left. The child's family found him through radio and newspapers. Soon, a red plaque of gratitude was brought into the company's gate, but he stood in the back, crying loudly. The company awarded him a second-class merit citation.

    别小看了聊天
    ——记株洲市自来水公司经理于希慈
    钟斌光　罗勇
    在湖南株洲市自来水公司干部和工人的心目中，经理于希慈有一个独特的本领，就是聊天。说来也怪，一些困难，只要他到群众中去聊一聊，大都能找出正确的解决办法。全公司870多名职工，有60％以上的职工他都“聊”过。谁有什么思想包袱，谁的子女能升学……他都能说出个八九不离十。他像一块磁铁，把众多的职工吸引在自己的身旁，心情舒畅地工作，使整个公司的各项经济技术指标在全国同行业中名列前茅。
    老于上任当经理那阵子，需要水的声浪一浪高一浪：市民等水下锅，工厂等水生产；这里扯皮，那里打架，……一堆堆乱糟糟的问题，弄得他懵头转向。
    “三人行，必有我师”。老于来到水池边、机器旁，向工人求教，向技术、管理人员讨策。大家七嘴八舌地议论开了：
      “经理呀！饭要一口一口地吃，事情要一件一件地办，我看首先要抓水，有了水才有效益呀！”一位老工人这样建议。
    “企业用水由企业投资，我看这是个解决城市供水的好法子。”已调走的老经理想出了绝招。
    “要把水抓上去，公司职工素质低不适应，要抓紧培训！”技术科长老朱对此很有研究。
    一个比较完整的切合实际的治厂方案“聊”出来了。此后，他抓紧实施“以水为本”的方案：他一连跑了上百家工厂，集资1000多万元；他紧急调兵遣将，架通了10多条大管道，解决了2000多户居民和企业用水难的问题，通水率达到99％以上，公司年创利润达1000万元以上。与此同时，公司花重金送了20多名职工上大学，又花20多万元建起了职工学校，开办了管工、电工等7个专业班，促进了公司技术和管理水平的提高。
    一个除夕之夜，从家属宿舍里，传来了阵阵吵架声。这是个三代同堂的家庭，住房太挤，婆媳间为搬动床铺吵起架来，连锅碗瓢盆都砸烂了。老于知道后，心里像刀绞一样，公司像这样的居住条件户还不少。他找了400多名职工谈心，400多户职工住房要解决，150多名儿童要入托，得花上千万元资金呀！还有上百名职工子女的就业问题，不是一下子可以解决的。他和大家商量如何逐步解决。有的提议自己动手干。
    不久，全体职工自力更生建起了五栋幼儿园。随着公司经济条件的好转，一些职工先后搬进了二室一厅的新居。158名职工子女的就业和90多名子女的升学问题也逐步得到了解决。还解决了20多对夫妻两地分居的问题。职工们还开展养鱼、养鸡、养猪、造林种果树等多种经营，看着这一切，大家笑了，老于心头也舒展了。
    这个公司职工平均年龄不到30岁，年轻人占70％以上。其中有一部分是招生考不上，招工不愿要，靠“顶职”进厂的，还有个别曾经失过足，服过刑的。他们中的有些人成天蹲茶馆、喝醉酒，抱着破罐子破摔的思想……老于静静地观察着，决心用自己炽热的情怀去温暖这一颗颗心灵被扭曲的年轻人。
    有一位青工蹲了2年“班房”回来后，心灰意冷，认为这一辈子全完了。老于一次又一次地找他聊天，苦口婆心地劝导他，诚恳地告诫他：“摔了跤，爬起来，朝前看，向着光明的道路走，会大有希望的。”
    语句真切，情挚缘槛，似甘露，似清泉，汩汩地流入了这个青工的心田。盛夏的一天，一个精神病人将一个儿童砍了数刀后扬长而去，当时围观者不少，可是没有人挺身而出，而他却背起血肉模糊的儿童，跑进医院，帮着挂号、取药、打针。待伤者转危为安时，他却悄悄离去。伤者的亲人通过广播、报纸才找到。不久，一块感激的红色大匾抬进了公司的大门，他却站在人群后面的角落里，放声地恸哭起来。公司为这位青工记了二等功。
