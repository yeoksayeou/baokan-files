Title: The Highland "Luthier"

In the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, a poet likened the 4,000-mile national defense communication line to "strings in the sky." Nearly a thousand male and female soldiers of the People's Liberation Army guard this line day and night, acting as faithful "luthiers" who pluck the strings.

	Sacred Land of Youth Dedication

Large clouds drift slowly overhead; rolling hills, jagged rocks, and deep ravines stretch out before you—this is the Tanggula Mountains at an altitude of 5,300 meters. The Logistics Department of the General Staff's Qinghai-Tibet Supply Corps' Wenquan Maintenance Station is set up by the icy river at the foot of the mountain. Along the line, there are 10 stations from Dachaidam in the north to Lhasa in the south, with an average altitude of over 4,000 meters.

	"Twenty-one years," the deputy commander of the First Independent Communication Regiment, Comrade Tu, blurted out: "We, generation after generation of soldiers, have been fighting against the high-altitude, cold, and oxygen-deficient conditions that threaten our lives. For over 700,000 days and nights, nearly a million messages have been transmitted, connecting Tibet, Qinghai, and Beijing."

The communication soldiers on the icy mountains selflessly dedicate their youth to the highlands. Internal line technician Huang Haibo, known as the "night owl" for troubleshooting, had his life's flame extinguished at the age of 26 at the source of the river; the station chief of the Tuotuo River Maintenance Station, Guan Maofu, lost his father and soon after his mother was diagnosed with cancer. His brother and sister-in-law urged him to return home, and his comrades urged him to leave, but he insisted on patrolling the lines with everyone. In the end, he shed tears over his parents' urns; female platoon leader Han Huichun, along with her female comrades who came and went, studied and demobilized, remained with batch after batch of female soldiers. She was awarded the title of "Advanced Female Individual of the entire army"...

	Accompanied by the Main Melody's Offbeat Notes

The Naqitai Maintenance Station is adjacent to a clear spring of the Kunlun Mountains. Naqitai is named after the golden statue of Sakyamuni Buddha that Princess Wencheng stored here. The spring water gushes from the depths of the Kunlun Mountains. Four captains from Yuanping County in Shanxi—Han Junli, Yin Haifei, Wang Yuncai, and Bai Meide—gathered by the spring, their hearts pouring out like the spring: "A year on the highlands is equivalent to five years in the interior. Soldiers endure three to five years before returning home, and we officers also need to change our environment."

Yin Haifei's face is yellow, his teeth are sparse and black, and his body is weak—this is the sculpture of 12 years on the Tanggula Mountains. Last year, he was taken care of and became the company commander of Ge'ermu Station. He smiled bitterly: "We enlisted at 17 or 18, got married at 27 or 28, and became fathers at 30. The highlands and the interior are far apart, and communication is slow. A year of leave to find a partner, and you haven't even remembered their appearance before it's over." The three comrades laughed and revealed: he had met 17 or 18 girls, and as soon as they heard about the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, they ran away. The daughter of a demobilized soldier, Wu Lan, just threw out the "ball," and he quickly cut through the chaos and married her. Their son is already two years old.

Han Junli, who became the deputy political instructor of the battalion, said: "The soldiers on the border and islands have their families in the interior receive housing and kindergarten admissions as dual-income households. What about the highland soldiers? 'I live at the source of the river, my wife lives at the end of the river,' money is thrown on the road, the family cannot be taken care of, visiting relatives, men spend a night at their wives' place, women spend a night at their husbands' place, there is no nest, always feeling inferior to others."

	The Price of "Second Employment"

	"Wudaoliang gets sick, Tanggula takes your life"; "Only those without fathers and mothers go to Tanggula." Highland soldiers are not afraid of hardship, but they like to joke about their environment.

After serving 10 years, their lips turn blue, their faces turn purple, their nails are concave, and they suffer from stomach problems and arthritis. Everyone looks forward to demobilization and transfer to a good position to seek psychological balance. For this, many people "follow the trend": treat guests, give gifts, find connections. Even after throwing out money and goods, there are still those who hit a wall. This year, because they couldn't find a suitable position, several officers returned to the unit.

To find a way out, they need to borrow the double wings of culture and technology. The cultural facilities here have improved, flattening the mountains to lay out a ball court, buying televisions and tape recorders, being able to read a bundle of "hugged paper" a month, and being able to have a movie "banquet" for several consecutive films, which is much more interesting than the past "soldiers watch soldiers during the day and stars at night." Today, they are even more eager to obtain "diplomas" in the army and learn a few practical skills, but they face more layers of difficulties than others. In the barracks, you often see someone studying, but when asked about the effect, the external line soldier Wen Zeng and female switchboard operator Li Jun also complained: "The highlands lack oxygen, always feeling dizzy and brain-swollen, intelligence declines, and you have to study hard."

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is vast and boundless. From the offbeat notes of the highland "luthiers," I heard the outpouring of the hearts of tens of thousands of officers and soldiers here. I believe that the Republic will not forget them.

    高原“琴师”
    本报记者　郅振璞
    在青藏高原上，有位诗人把4000里国防通信干线比喻为“天上的琴弦”。人民解放军近千名男女官兵日夜守护在这里，是拨响琴弦的忠实的“琴师”。
          奉献青春的圣地
    大朵大朵的流云，缓缓掠过头顶；丘陵起伏，石山嶙峋，沟壑纵横。——这就是海拔5300米的唐古拉山。总后青藏兵站部温泉机务站，就设在山麓冰河旁。沿线北起大柴旦、南达拉萨10个站，平均海拔4000米以上。
    “21年了”，第一独立通信营涂副营长脱口说道：“我们一代一代军人，同威胁生命的高寒缺氧作战，7000多个日日夜夜，近百万个讯息，沟通了西藏、青海和北京。”
    冰天雪岭的通信兵，无私地把青春年华献给高原。内线技师黄海波，人称排故障的“夜猫子”，26岁的生命之火熄在江河源头；沱沱河机务站长关茂福，父亲去世不久，母亲又患癌症告危，兄嫂催归，战友催行，他坚持和大家一起巡线，末了，把眼泪洒在父母骨灰盒上；女排长韩慧春，同来的女伴，上学、复员都走了，她仍和一茬一茬女兵滚在一起，被授予“全军妇女先进个人”称号……
        伴随着主旋律的弦外音
    纳赤台机务站，邻近有一汪清澈的昆仑泉。纳赤台，因当年文成公主在此存放释迦牟尼的金佛像而得名。泉水从昆仑山深处汩汩翻涌，来自山西原平县的4个上尉——韩俊礼、尹海飞、王运才、白美德，围在泉旁心声如泉：“高原的一年，等于内地5年。战士熬三五年回家了，我们干部也需要换换环境。”
    尹海飞面色腊黄、牙齿黑稀、身板瘦弱，这是唐古拉山12年的雕塑。去年照顾他当了格尔木站连长。他苦笑道：“我们十七八岁当兵，二十七八岁结婚，30岁当上爹。高原和内地，路远通信慢，一年探亲找个对象，还没记住相貌就吹了。”3个战友笑着揭了底：他见过十七八个姑娘，一听说青藏高原就吓跑了。退伍军人的女儿吴兰刚抛出“彩球”，他就快刀斩乱麻地和她成了家，儿子也两岁了。
    当了营副教导员的韩俊礼说：“边疆、海岛的军人，内地家属在分房、孩子入托上学能按双职工待遇，高原兵呢，‘我住江河头，妻居江河尾’，钱扔在路上，家治不上，探亲男家一晚、女家一宿，没个窝儿，总觉低人一等。”
  “第二次就业”的代价
    “五道梁得了病，唐古拉要了命”；“没有爹和妈，才上唐古拉”。高原兵并不怕苦，但喜欢戏称所处的环境。
    当10年兵，唇青、脸紫、指甲凹，胃病、关节炎缠身，谁都盼复员转业有个好去处，以求心理平衡。为此，有不少人“赶时髦”：请客、送礼、找关系。抛出钱和物，仍有碰壁的。今年因找不到合适的岗位，返部队就有好几个干部。
    为找出路，他们要借文化和技术的双翼。这里文化设施已有改善，平了山头铺球场，买了电视、收录机，能看一月抱一捆的“抱纸”，能过连续几个片的电影“会餐”，比过去“白天兵看兵，夜晚看星星”有趣多了。今天，他们更渴望在部队拿到“文凭”，学几手实用技术，然而却比别人多层困难。军营里时常见到有人伏案学习，问到效果时，智商较高的外线兵温增、女话务兵李军也抱怨：“高原缺氧，总是头昏脑胀，智力减退，拚命苦钻呗。”
    青藏高原广袤无垠，记者从高原“琴师”的弦外音里，听到这里数万官兵心声的流泻。我想，共和国不会忘记他们。
