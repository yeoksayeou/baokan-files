Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 19th.

The two largest and most challenging new sports venues for the Asian Games—the Northern Suburbs Swimming Stadium and the Northern Suburbs Comprehensive Sports Stadium—have recently completed the installation of their roof panels, marking the end of their structural construction. Large-scale interior renovations are now being expedited.

Both stadiums employ a bridge-style cable-stayed truss structure, with the roofs assembled from imported colored steel panels. This is the first time that cable-stayed technology and roof panel materials have been applied to building construction in the country.

According to the construction site command department, the most difficult phase of construction for these two stadiums has been completed. Although the remaining work is still substantial, there is confidence in completing the project on schedule.

    亚运会工程加紧进行
    难度最大两馆完成结构施工
    新华社北京7月19日电　（通讯员裴季壮）亚运会新建体育场馆中最大和最难的两个体育馆——北郊游泳馆和北郊综合体育馆，于近日装完了屋面板，结构施工宣告完成，大面积装修正在加紧进行。
    这两座体育馆均采用了桥式斜拉索人字形钢网架结构，屋面由进口彩色钢板拼装而成。这是国内首次将斜拉索技术和屋面板材料应用于房屋建筑。
    据工地指挥部测算，这两座体育馆最难的施工阶段已经过去，余下的工作量尽管还相当可观，但如期竣工是有把握的。
