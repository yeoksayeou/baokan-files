Among the Nordic countries, Sweden was the first to utilize nuclear power for electricity generation following the oil crisis of the 1970s. Currently, the country operates 12 nuclear reactors, which supply 50% of Sweden's total electricity.

Following the incidents at the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear power plants, as in many other parts of the world, there is a widespread fear of nuclear energy here. In the early 1980s, Sweden held a public referendum on nuclear energy, concluding that all nuclear power plants should be shut down by the year 2010. Last October, the government, in response to the wishes of the majority of voters, announced that it would close two nuclear power plants ahead of schedule. However, nuclear energy is the cheapest source of electricity in the world. Therefore, whether to stop using nuclear power plants remains a contentious issue in Sweden.

Recently, the reporter visited the Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant in southern Sweden to discuss nuclear power safety. According to the regulations, the reporter changed into protective clothing and hat, wore a radiation detector, and accompanied the plant engineer, Yorgson, into the work area. Above a blue pool stood a high gantry crane, with two workers operating it to move nuclear fuel 40 meters underwater. At the other end of the pool, one could see the green dome of the reactor's top underwater.

Yorgson pointed to the clear underwater fuel rods containing nuclear fuel and said, "People often view nuclear power plants as terrifying as nuclear weapons. In fact, a nuclear power plant cannot explode like an atomic bomb. Because a nuclear explosion requires at least 20% enriched uranium, but in Sweden's reactors, the nuclear fuel contains only 2% to 3% enriched uranium. Of course, if a nuclear power plant has an accident, the threat to human life, property, and the environment is not to be underestimated. Therefore, Sweden has always placed great emphasis on the safety control of nuclear power plants, ensuring that the 12 reactors are in a good state of safety."

The Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant uses two light-water reactors, which are safer than graphite-type reactors and have a structure similar to some Western light-water reactors. Yorgson said that to prevent nuclear leaks, they have created five barriers. The final barrier is the explosion-proof layer outside the reactor, consisting of a 1-meter-thick concrete wall, a 1-centimeter-thick steel plate, and a layer of inert gas. He believes that if the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant had such a thick explosion-proof layer, it would not have caused the casualties it did.

After the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant accident in the United States in 1979, the Swedish government established the Nuclear Reactor Safety Committee to strengthen the safety management of nuclear power plants. The committee regularly inspects the safety conditions of various nuclear power plants and deducts a portion from their profits for nuclear energy safety research. Yorgson pointed to a nearby cylindrical building about 40 meters high and said that this was an additional barrier designed by Swedish nuclear experts after the Three Mile Island accident to prevent nuclear leaks. Inside, there are numerous small stones about 3 centimeters in diameter, forming a special filter. If the explosion-proof layer cannot stop high-temperature cesium, strontium, and iodine and other radioactive gases, they will be directed through release pipes into the filter, where they will collide with the stones, gradually cool down, and eventually settle and adhere to the stones. According to the design, this filter can absorb 99.9% of the radioactive substances in the air. It is reported that this filter is a world first.

Accompanying Yorgson, the reporter passed through the noisy generator room and entered the observation deck of the central control room. All activities of the power plant are controlled by computers, and this control room has three people on duty around the clock. Yorgson said, "Don't be fooled by their seemingly relaxed work. These people have all undergone special training to handle various accidents." Yorgson said that to effectively train nuclear power plant technicians, Sweden built the first computer-simulated nuclear power plant in Europe, designing various nuclear power plant accident programs. All control room staff and technicians must undergo 42 days of simulated training there. They must also return there for a 7-day refresher course every year.

After the Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, the Barsebäck Nuclear Power Plant, as a precaution, collaborated with local administrative authorities to develop an emergency plan, dividing the 50-kilometer area around the nuclear power plant into two emergency zones. Normally, there are people monitoring the radiation levels. Each household has an emergency manual detailing how to avoid nuclear radiation. If an accident occurs, all residents will be quickly organized by the emergency team to evacuate.

When asked how they handle nuclear waste, Yorgson replied, "For medium and low-level nuclear waste, we remove or evaporate the water content, and the remaining solid radioactive substances are placed in asphalt and sealed in metal cans, which are then stored in an underground repository. For high-intensity nuclear waste, most of it is placed in sealed containers and transported by special ships to Forsmark in eastern Sweden, where the Swedish Nuclear Waste Management Company buries it in pools 500 meters deep in the rock. The Swedish government's requirement for this work is to leave no problems for future generations."

    瑞典的核电安全管理
    本报记者　顾耀铭
    在北欧国家中，瑞典是在70年代石油危机之后首先应用核能发电的国家。目前，全国共有12个核反应堆被利用发电，供电量已占瑞典总发电量的50％。
    随着三里岛核电站和切尔诺贝利核电站事故的发生，同世界上许多地方一样，这里也普遍产生了惧怕核能的心理。80年代初，瑞典曾就核能举行过公民投票，结论是在2010年以前停止使用所有的核电站。去年10月，政府顺应多数选民的愿望，表示将提前关闭两个核电站。然而，核能是世界上最廉价的电力燃料。因此，是否停止使用核电站在瑞典仍有争议。
    最近，记者就核电安全问题采访了位于瑞典南端的巴塞贝克核电站。按照这里的规定，记者换上防护衣帽，佩戴原子能辐射计，随同电站工程师约格松进入工作区。在一个蔚蓝色的水池上垮立着一台高架龙门起重机，上面有两名工作人员正在操纵移动40米水下的核燃料。在水池的另一端可以看到水下绿色的大圆顶，那就是反应堆的顶部。
    约格松指着水下清晰可见、装有核燃料的蕊管说：“人们常常把核电站看得与核武器一样可怕。事实上核电站不可能像原子弹那样爆炸。因为，核爆炸至少要有20％的可裂变铀，但是，在瑞典的反应堆里，核燃料只含有2％—3％的可裂变铀。当然，核电站如发生事故，对人的生命、财产和环境造成的威胁是不可忽视的。因此，瑞典从一开始就十分重视核电站的安全控制，使12个反应堆一直处于良好的安全状态。”
    巴塞贝克核电站使用的是两个轻水反应堆，安全性要比石墨型反应堆强，其结构同一些西方国家的轻水反应堆基本相似。约格松说，他们为防止核泄漏制造了5道障碍，最后一道障碍是反应堆外面的防爆层。它由1米厚的混凝土墙、1厘米厚的钢板以及一层惰性气体构成。他认为切尔诺贝利核电站如果有这样坚厚的防爆层就不可能造成工作人员伤亡事故。
    在1979年美国三里岛核电站事故后，瑞典政府成立了核反应堆安全委员会，负责加强对核电站的安全管理。委员会定期派人检查各核电站的安全情况，并从各站的赢利中提成作为核能安全研究费用。约格松指着同工作区邻近的一座约40米高的圆柱型建筑说，这是在三里岛事故后，瑞典核能专家为了防止核泄漏而设计增加的又一道障碍。里面装着大量直径3厘米左右的小石子，是一座特殊的过滤器。如果防爆层不能阻挡高温的铯、锶和碘等放射性气态物质，它们将通过释放管道被引入滤器，同石子撞击后，将逐渐冷却，最后沉降依附在石子上。按设计考虑，这座滤器能吸收空气中99.9％的放射物质。据介绍，这座滤器在世界上属首创。
    记者随同约格松经过轰鸣的发电机房，进入中央控制室的观察台。电站的所有活动都是由电脑控制，这座控制室有3人昼夜值班。约格松说：“你别看他们工作似乎很轻松。这些人都经过了处理各种事故的特殊训练。”约格松说，为了有效地训练核电站技术人员，瑞典建立了欧洲第一座计算机模拟核电站，设计了各种核电站事故程序。所有控制室的工作人员和技术人员必须在里面接受为期42天的模拟训练。每年还要回到那里进行7天的复习。
    在切尔诺贝利核电站事故发生后，巴塞贝克核电站为了防止万一，他们同周围地区的行政当局联合制定了应急计划，将核电站周围50公里范围划分为两个应急区。平时有专人监测核辐射量。每户居民都有一本应急手册，详细介绍如何避免核辐射。如果事故发生，所有居民将会由应急小组迅速组织撤离。
    当记者问及他们怎样处理核废料时，约格松回答说：“对中低度核废料，我们采取将其中的水分净化或蒸发，剩下的固态放射物质装入沥青内，然后封存在金属筒里，集中放在一个地下贮藏库。对于高强度核废料，大部分被装入密封仓，用专门的船只运往瑞典东部的福斯马克，由瑞典核废料处理公司集中埋在500米深石头下的水池中。瑞典政府对这项工作的要求是不要给后代留下任何后患。”
