The China Association for Science and Technology recently held its Third Council's Thirteenth Meeting and issued a call to action to scientists and technologists across the country. The call urges them to boost their spirits and fully leverage the crucial role of science and technology in national economic development and social progress. It encourages unity and hard work, instilling confidence to continue pushing forward the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening up.

The call to action urges scientists and technologists to thoroughly study the documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. It emphasizes the need to fully understand and correctly handle the dialectical relationship between upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up. It calls for a review of the work done since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, reflecting on the past and planning for the future. It stresses the importance of maintaining a firm belief in the victory of socialism and enhancing the awareness of implementing the basic line of "one center, two basic points."

The call to action points out that scientists and technologists should contribute to the transformation of traditional industries and catching up with the world's new technological revolution. They should strive to overcome technological challenges and promote practical technologies to urban and rural enterprises, providing technical services. In today's world, where science and technology are rapidly advancing and open, scientists and technologists should take the lead in opening up to the outside world. They should integrate the spirit of independent self-reliance, hard work, and learning from all useful foreign science and technology. The goal of introducing advanced foreign technologies is to accelerate scientific and technological progress. Through digestion, absorption, and innovation, the self-development capabilities of China's economy and science and technology should be enhanced.

The call to action urges the scientific community to adhere to the simultaneous development of the two civilizations, contributing to the strengthening of ideological and political education and socialist spiritual civilization construction. It advocates for the scientific spirit of "dedication, innovation, pragmatism, and cooperation" and the scientific ethics of "upholding truth, honest labor, cherishing talents, and close cooperation" among scientific personnel. It calls for the promotion of academic democracy and the resolute opposition to and elimination of fraud in scientific work.

The call to action emphasizes the need to focus on several key tasks for the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening up. It calls for the continuous and in-depth promotion of the "Ideal Competition, Contribution Comparison" campaign among engineering and technical personnel in factories and mines nationwide, in conjunction with the "Double Increase, Double Reduction" movement, to save energy, reduce consumption, and improve product quality. It stresses the importance of continuing to strengthen science popularization work in urban and rural areas, establishing rural professional technical research associations, and promoting a batch of practical technologies such as improved seeds, water-saving agriculture, and courtyard economy to contribute to the bumper harvests of the next two years. It calls for increased efforts to work in ethnic minority areas. It emphasizes the need to continue to organize domestic and international academic exchange activities, fully utilizing the role of civilian channels, actively promoting international civilian scientific and technological exchanges, and doing more propaganda and explanatory work to various countries and overseas scientific and technological personnel. This will promote the further development of friendly exchanges and cooperation.
