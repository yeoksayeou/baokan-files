The Karst forest in Maolan, located in Libo County, Guizhou, is the only remaining pristine forest at the same latitude in the world today. From the perspectives of archaeology, scientific research, and tourism, it is truly a "world's unique." Last June, the State Council designated this pristine forest as a national-level nature reserve.

However, this reserve is now being severely damaged. Villagers from Guizhou and Guangxi take turns burning the mountains to clear land for farming every year, resulting in vast areas of pristine forest being reduced to ashes. In late April this year, I accompanied four experts from the Southwest Garden Research Institute and other units to visit the Xiaoqikong site in this reserve. We witnessed three large mountains simultaneously on fire. Despite their old age and frail bodies, the experts, along with local forestry bureau officials and staff, fought tirelessly to extinguish the fire. However, more than ten local villagers stood by, mocking and playing, refusing to help put out the fire.

Additionally, the villagers around this reserve have never stopped illegally logging. Currently, large areas of pristine forest on the edge of the reserve have been completely cut down, and the axe of evil is now reaching into the depths of the pristine forest. Every time we enter the reserve, we hear the sound of logging deep in the forest. When I and the experts were fighting the forest fire, we discovered a lumber processing plant deep in the dense forest. Trees over ten meters long had been sawn into planks and piled up on the ground. The experts looked at all this and shed tears of sorrow.

### 罪恶之斧砍向“世界一绝”

    罪恶之斧砍向“世界一绝”
    地处贵州荔波县境内的茂兰喀斯特森林，是当今世界同纬度上唯一保留的原始森林，从考古、科研和旅游的角度都堪称“世界一绝”。去年6月，国务院将这一原始森林确定为国家级自然保护区。
    然而，这个保护区正惨遭毁坏。居住在这里的贵州、广西两地的村民年年轮番放火烧山种地，致使大片大片原始森林毁于一炬。今年4月下旬，我随西南园林科研处等单位的4位专家到这个保护区小七孔点参观，目睹3座大山同时起火。专家们不顾年老体弱，同当地林业局干部职工奋力灭火，但10多名当地村民在一旁讥笑玩乐，不肯上前灭火。
    另外，这个保护区周围的村民偷伐林木的行为从未间断过。目前，保护区边缘的大片原始森林已被砍光，罪恶之斧正伸向原始森林的深处。我们每次到保护区内，总听到森林深处的伐木声。当我和专家们扑救林火时，竟发现密林深处有一个木材加工场，10多米长的树木被锯成板材，堆了一地。专家们看着这一切，心疼地流下眼泪。
