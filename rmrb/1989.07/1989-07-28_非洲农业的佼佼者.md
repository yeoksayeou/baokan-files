Zimbabwe, known as the "breadbasket of Africa" and the "tobacco kingdom," is one of the countries that has successfully diversified its agriculture. It produces wheat, sorghum, soybeans, peanuts, cotton, coffee, sugarcane, and tea, all of which have export potential. Therefore, interviewing Zimbabwe's agriculture, one of the three pillars of its economy, was a topic of great interest for the reporter during his recent trip to Africa.

Upon arriving in the capital, Harare, the hosts informed us that to honor President Mugabe's outstanding contributions to agricultural development, the International Anti-Hunger Organization awarded him a prize in September of last year. Among the entourage accompanying Mugabe to the United States to receive the award was Gary Magats, the chairman of the Black Commercial Farmers' Association, who is responsible for coordinating over 10,000 black commercial farms and is also a highly successful farmer himself. He invited us to visit his farm.

On the appointed day, Mr. Gary personally drove to pick us up. His farm is located in the central province, about 70 kilometers from Harare. Along the way, this shrewd and cheerful farmer chatted with the reporter as he drove. He mentioned that he had worked as an agricultural technician for many years and had also worked in a fertilizer factory. In 1983, he began managing his own farm.

Upon arriving at his farm, he led us on a tour. Although this farm is not as large or mechanized as the typical white-owned farms, it is quite representative among black commercial farms. He has 978 hectares of land, where he grows corn and cotton, and also raises 100 head of beef cattle and 7 dairy cows. He owns 6 tractors and a large truck. Next to the house, surrounded by flowers and trees, there is a large warehouse about 50 meters long and 20 meters wide, as well as a grain mill and a storage shed for large agricultural tools and tractors. Usually, 60 workers are responsible for field management, and during the busy farming season, over 300 seasonal workers are hired. While touring the fields, the reporter noticed that although some of the land is not very fertile, water from the Harare River is continuously brought in through a 3-kilometer-long irrigation canal, making the crops grow lush and green, which was very pleasing to see.

When he drove us to a large field by the hills, it happened to be raining lightly. The cotton fields had been neatly cleaned up. The green corn leaves were adorned with sparkling raindrops. The host told us that last year's cotton harvest was bountiful, and this year, the corn that stretched as far as the eye could see would also yield a good harvest.

Mr. Gary is truly an "excellent farmer." He not only manages his own farm meticulously but also has a comprehensive understanding of the overall development of Zimbabwe's agriculture. He believes that Zimbabwe's agriculture has become a leader in Africa due to President Mugabe and his government's special emphasis on agriculture. Mugabe, who comes from a farming family, saw that before independence, the vast majority of black people were forced to farm on barren land using backward production methods, toiling all year round without enough to eat. He vowed to change Zimbabwe's agricultural situation. After independence, he guided the broad masses of black farmers from self-sufficient agriculture to commercial agricultural networks. Now, on Zimbabwe's vast lands, four groups of agricultural forces are active:

First, there are white commercial farmers. Their farms are large, highly modernized, and have high yields. Due to Mugabe's government's policy of promoting harmony between blacks and whites and protecting the legitimate interests of whites after independence, many white farmers stayed on to continue managing their farms, and some who left have returned. Currently, Zimbabwe has 4,500 white commercial farms, which cultivate 40% of the country's arable land. Government leaders often discuss and help solve agricultural development problems with the leaders of their organizations, greatly motivating white farmers' production enthusiasm. The average production growth rate of white commercial farms is 9%, and their output value is increasing year by year.

Second, there are communal farmers. This group is the largest in number and is basically traditional small farmers with backward production methods in the past. Due to the government's emphasis on developing the economy of communal farmers, sending large numbers of agricultural technicians to guide them, issuing agricultural loans, raising the purchase prices of agricultural products, and helping them organize cooperatives, communal agriculture has quickly developed. For example, in 1988, the national cotton production totaled 320,000 tons, of which communal farmers' production accounted for 50%.

Third, there are refugees who have rebuilt their homes with government help. During the independence war, large numbers of farmers left their homes and fled to neighboring countries. After independence, the government purchased 5 million hectares of land to resettle refugees and help them restore production. Now they can also sell a considerable amount of agricultural and pastoral products to the state.

Fourth, there are black commercial farmers. Before independence, there were very few black-operated commercial farms. After independence, the government encouraged and supported the development of black commercial farms. Those with management capabilities can apply for government loans to purchase land abandoned by whites to establish farms. They have also established their own organization, the "Black Commercial Farmers' Association." Last year, the government purchased 1.1 million tons of corn, of which 64% was produced by black commercial farms, while before independence, it could only provide 8% of agricultural products. It is worth noting that the development of black commercial farms has contributed to solving Zimbabwe's employment problem. Mr. Gary said that black-operated farms are more in line with the current national conditions of Zimbabwe. Because they use fewer machines and employ more people, over 10,000 black farms can solve a significant part of the employment problem for the government.

These four groups of agricultural forces each have their own characteristics and have all contributed to the development of Zimbabwe's agriculture, making Zimbabwe's agriculture vibrant. In 1988, Zimbabwe's national economic growth rate was 6%, which is closely related to its good agricultural policies and development situation.

### 非洲农业的佼佼者

    非洲农业的佼佼者
    本报记者　徐德文
    被誉为“非洲粮仓”和“烟草王国”的津巴布韦，是农业多样化搞得较好的国家之一。它所生产的小麦、高粱、大豆、花生、棉花、咖啡、甘蔗和茶叶等，都具有创汇能力。因而，对津巴布韦三大经济支柱之一的农业进行采访，是记者最近非洲之行颇感兴趣的问题。
  一到首都哈拉雷，主人就告诉我们，为了表彰穆加贝总统在发展农业方面作出的杰出贡献，去年9月，国际反饥饿组织已向穆加贝颁奖。与穆加贝总统一起赴美领奖的随行人员中，有位叫加里·马加茨的黑人商业农场协会主席，他负责1万多个黑人商业农场的协调工作，又是一位很有成就的农场主，他邀请我们去参观他的农场。
    到了约定那一天，加里先生亲自驾车来接我们。他的农场在中部省，离哈拉雷70公里。途中，这位精明能干、性格开朗的农场主边驾车边同记者聊天。他说，他当过多年的农业技术员，也在化肥厂工作过，1983年开始自己经营农场。
    车到他的农场，他带领我们参观。这个农场虽不如一般白人经营的农场规模大、机械化程度高，但在黑人商业农场中颇有代表性。他共有978公顷土地，除种玉米外，也种棉花，还饲养了100头肉牛、7头奶牛；拥有6台拖拉机和一辆大卡车。在花木围绕的住宅旁边，有一个约长50米、宽20米的大仓库，还有粉碎机房和放置大农具、拖拉机等的库房。平时有60名工人负责田间管理，农忙时则雇佣300多名季节工。在田头参观时，记者看到有的土地虽不太肥沃，但通过3公里长的小水渠源源引来哈拉雷河的水进行灌溉，因而作物长的绿油油的，十分喜人。
    当他驾车把我们带到依傍岗峦的一大片田地时，恰遇阴雨丝丝。棉田已收拾得干干净净。绿油油的玉米叶上晶莹的雨露滚动。主人告诉我们，去年棉花获得丰收，今年，那一眼望不到头的玉米又将获得好收成。
    加里先生不愧为“优秀的农场主”，他不仅把自己的农场管理得井井有条，而且对整个津巴布韦农业的发展情况了如指掌。他认为，津巴布韦的农业所以在非洲成为佼佼者，与穆加贝总统及他领导的政府特别重视农业有关。穆加贝出身于农民家庭，他看到独立前的广大黑人被迫在贫瘠的土地上，以落后的生产方式进行耕种，终年辛勤劳动而不得温饱，他立志要改变津巴布韦的农业状况。独立后，他指引广大黑人农民从自耕自给的农业走向商业农业网络方向。如今，在津巴布韦广阔的土地上活跃着4个方面的农业大军：
    一是白人商业农场主。他们经营的农场规模大、现代化程度高、产量大。由于独立后穆加贝政府实行黑人与白人和睦相处的民族团结政策，保护白人的合法利益，很多白人农场主留下来继续经营农场，有的离开后重又回来。现在津巴布韦共有4500个白人商业农场，所耕种的土地占全国耕地面积的40％。政府有关领导人经常与他们所成立的组织的领导人一起探讨并帮助解决农业发展中遇到的问题，因而大大调动了白人农场主的生产积极性。白人商业农场平均生产增长率为9％，产值也逐年增加。
    二是村社农民。这支队伍人数最多，基本上是传统的小农，过去生产方式落后。由于政府重视发展村社农民经济，派出大批农业技术人员对他们进行指导，发放农业贷款，提高农产品收购价格，帮助他们组织合作社，从而使村社农业很快发展。例如，1988年全国棉花总产量为32万吨，其中村社农民的产量占50％。
    三是在政府帮助下重建家园的难民。独立战争期间，大批农民背井离乡，逃亡邻国。独立后，政府收购了500万公顷土地安置难民，帮助他们重建家园，恢复生产。现在他们也能向国家交售相当数量的农牧产品。
    四是黑人商业农场主。独立前黑人经营商业农场的为数很少。独立后，政府鼓励并支持黑人商业农场的发展。有经营能力的人可向政府贷款以购买白人弃置的土地开设农场。他们也建立了自己的组织“黑人商业农场协会”。去年政府收购玉米110万吨，黑人商业农场生产的占64％，而在独立前，它只能提供8％的农产品。尤应指出，黑人商业农场的发展对津巴布韦就业问题的解决作出了贡献。加里先生说，黑人经营的农场更符合目前津巴布韦的国情。因它机械少，用人相对多，1万多个黑人农场能为政府解决颇大一部分人的就业问题。
    以上四个方面的农业大军各有特点，都为津巴布韦农业的发展作出贡献，使津巴布韦农业呈现一派生机。1988年津巴布韦国民经济增长率为6％，就与较好的农业政策和发展形势密切相关。
