This summer's grain harvest has been a success, with an estimated total production increase of 30 billion kilograms compared to last year, surpassing the highest historical yield. This is the result of the hard work of hundreds of millions of farmers, the emphasis and strengthening of agriculture from the central to local levels, and the favorable conditions provided by nature and the market. We hope that the broad masses of cadres and people on the agricultural front will continue to persevere and press forward, quickly shifting the focus of work to summer planting and management, and sparing no effort to ensure a good autumn harvest. We must take every possible measure to overcome natural disasters and achieve a full harvest in agriculture. This is an important task proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Completing this task is of special importance for stabilizing urban and rural markets and the overall economy.

The success of this summer's grain harvest once again demonstrates that Chinese agriculture has the potential for increased production, and the strategic vision proposed by the Party Central Committee and the State Council for grain production to reach a new level is based on reality. In recent years, Chinese agriculture, especially grain production, has been stagnant, mainly because the foundational position of agriculture has been weakened to varying degrees, and various levels and regions have relaxed their leadership over agriculture. Since last year, the Party Central Committee and the State Council, from the perspective of the overall national economy, have proposed the policy of rectification and deepening reform, and formulated a series of policies that favor agriculture, rapidly "revitalizing" agriculture. Various levels of leadership have shifted their thinking and actions from the previous years of relaxing and neglecting agriculture, universally strengthening the organization and leadership of agriculture. Undoubtedly, this is an important prerequisite for achieving this summer's grain harvest. The facts have proven that whether agriculture is valued or not makes a big difference. Only when leaders truly prioritize agriculture in their minds and take concrete measures to ensure it, can agriculture develop sustainably and steadily.

We are still a country with a relatively low level of production, and the output level of agriculture compared to developed countries still has a considerable gap. This gap itself is a tremendous potential. Who will tap into this potential? The hundreds of millions of farmers. Chinese farmers have a strong desire to increase production and produce more grain. They love the land, work diligently, and especially since the reform and opening up, their commercial awareness and market concepts have been strengthened, and the level of scientific farming has generally improved. We must cherish this enthusiasm of the farmers, protect and guide it with correct policies, and strive to improve various production and technical services, making it a great force to promote agricultural development. This summer's grain harvest not only laid a foundation for the entire year's increased production but, more importantly, showed us the hope of relying on the broad masses of farmers to increase material and technological inputs, pushing agriculture out of its stagnant situation. Seizing this new opportunity, with better policies and more practical measures, organizing farmers, we can turn this hope into a starting point for climbing to a new level.

Achieving a full harvest in agriculture for the entire year requires real effort. Because, in terms of grain, summer grain in China is only a small part, the main part is in the autumn harvest, and autumn production still faces various difficulties. For example, although the foundational position of agriculture has been recognized by more and more people this year, there is still a gap in actual actions, and it is not balanced; the various measures formulated by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to increase agricultural investment have not been fully implemented in many places; the idea of serving agriculture and farmers has not been firmly established in some departments, and incidents of exploiting farmers still occur; recently, some places in the south have been hit by heavy rains, and some places in the north have experienced drought, and many places have severe pest and disease outbreaks. These unfavorable factors may all affect the autumn harvest. The most prominent and urgent problem is the shortage of production materials such as fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, and machinery. Regarding this, various levels of leadership and departments must take it seriously, come up with practical measures, and prioritize the most urgent needs of farmers, solving one issue at a time. Currently, the first task is to ensure the production and supply of production materials. This work involves many departments and requires everyone to work together in unity. This year, after some important production materials were put under monopoly management, the chaotic situation in the circulation process was to some extent curbed, and it was welcomed by farmers. However, due to various reasons, new problems such as price increases, reduced channels, and untimely supply that affect agricultural production have also emerged. We hope that all relevant departments will prioritize the overall situation, prioritize the interests of farmers and the development of agriculture, quickly study the new problems, come up with improvement measures, and effectively implement the monopoly management work.

China is a country with 1.1 billion people, and the issue of agriculture and food must never be neglected at any time. Since the reform and opening up, a prominent feature of China's rural areas is the comprehensive development and prosperity of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fisheries, and township enterprises. Achieving a full harvest this year includes all aspects of the rural economy, but the focus of leadership work should be on grain production. The simple truth is that "without agriculture, there is no stability, and without grain, there is chaos." This simple truth should still be remembered. Let us unite as one, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, earnestly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and strive to lay a solid foundation for agriculture, achieve a full harvest in agriculture this year, persevere, and work hard.

    再接再厉夺取今年农业全面丰收
    本报评论员
    今年夏粮丰收，总产量预计比去年增加30亿公斤，可超过历史最高年份。这是亿万农民辛勤劳动的结果，是从中央到地方重视和加强农业的结果，也是与“老天帮忙”、“市场拉动”的作用分不开的。希望农业战线的广大干部群众再接再厉、乘胜前进，尽快把工作重点转向夏种、夏管，全力以赴搞好秋季生产，千方百计战胜自然灾害，夺取农业的全面丰收。这是党的十三届四中全会提出的一项重要任务。完成这一任务，对稳定城乡市场、稳定经济全局具有特殊的重要意义。
    夏粮丰收的事实再次表明，我国农业是存在增产潜力的，党中央、国务院提出的关于粮食生产要上新台阶的战略构想是有现实基础的。前几年我国农业尤其是粮食生产之所以陷入徘徊困境，主要是因为农业的基础地位遭到了不同程度的削弱，各级和各地放松了对农业的领导。去年以来，党中央、国务院从国民经济大局出发，提出了治理整顿、深化改革的方针，并制定了一系列向农业倾斜的政策，推动农业迅速“升温”。各级领导从思想到行动扭转了前几年放松和忽视农业的倾向，普遍加强了对农业的组织、领导。毫无疑问，这是夺得今年夏粮丰收的一个重要前提。事实证明，重视不重视大不一样，只有领导从思想上真正把农业摆正位置，并采取切实措施予以保证，农业才能持续、稳步发展。
    我们还是一个生产水平较低的国家，农业的产出水平与发达国家相比还有相当大的差距。这本身就是一种巨大潜力。靠谁来挖掘潜力？靠亿万农民群众。我国亿万农民有增加生产、多打粮食的强烈愿望。他们热爱土地，勤恳耐劳，特别是改革开放以来，商品意识和市场观念有所加强，科学种田的水平普遍提高。我们要珍视农民的这种积极性，用正确的政策加以保护和引导，努力搞好各项生产技术服务，使之成为推动农业发展的巨大力量。今年夏粮丰收，不仅为全年增产打下了一个基础，更重要的是使我们看到了依靠广大农民增加物质和科技投入，推动农业走出徘徊局面的希望。抓住这一新的景象，用更好的政策、更实的措施，组织农民，就能够把这种希望变成攀登新台阶的起点。
    夺取全年农业丰收，需要实实在在的努力。因为就粮食而言，夏粮在我国只是一个小头，大头还在秋收，而秋季生产还面临着种种困难。例如，今年以来，农业的基础地位虽然已为越来越多的人所认识，但真正在行动上体现出来还有差距，还不平衡；党中央、国务院制定的有关增加农业投入的各项措施，在许多地方还没有完全落实；为农业服务，为农民服务的思想在一些部门也没有牢固确立，坑农的事件时有发生；最近，南方一些地方暴雨成灾，北方局部地方出现旱情，不少地方病虫害严重。这些不利因素都可能影响秋季丰收。最为突出和紧迫的问题是化肥、农药、柴油、机械等生产资料短缺。对此，各级领导和各个部门务必认真对待，拿出实实在在的措施来，分别轻重缓急，一件一件地把农民最迫切解决的事情抓紧办好。当前，首先要抓好生产资料的生产、供应工作。这项工作牵涉到众多部门，需要大家齐心协力、通力合作。今年部分重要生产资料实行专营以后，一定程度制止了流通过程中的混乱现象，受到农民欢迎。但由于种种原因，也确实出现了价格上涨、渠道减少、供应不及时等影响农业生产的新问题。希望各有关部门都以大局为重，以农民的利益、农业的发展为重，尽快研究新问题，拿出改进办法，把专营工作切实搞好。
    我国是11亿人口的大国，农业问题，吃饭问题，任何时候都不能有任何的忽视。改革开放以来，我国农村一个最显著特点是农、林、牧、副、渔、乡村工业全面发展，全面繁荣。夺取今年全面丰收，包括农村经济的各个方面，但领导工作的重点，要放在抓粮食生产上。“无农不稳，无粮则乱”，这个朴素的道理还是应该牢记的。让我们同心同德，在党中央、国务院领导下，认真贯彻十三届四中全会精神，为打好农业这个基础，夺取今年农业全面丰收，再接再厉，努力奋斗。
