The campaign to "focus on production and improve service skills" is currently underway at China International Airlines.

The company is responsible for 32 international routes and 44 domestic trunk routes. Although the company only celebrated its first anniversary on July 1, it has already shown signs of vitality: in 1988, it completed nearly 10 billion ton-kilometers of transport turnover and achieved a profit of 580 million yuan. With the development of flight operations, the company has purchased one Boeing 767 aircraft and has signed a contract with foreign companies to purchase three more Boeing 747 aircraft.

From January to April this year, the company's various production indicators have maintained a good upward trend. However, since May, due to the impact of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, production and operations have suffered significant losses. In response to the current situation of fewer passengers, the company has promptly adjusted the number of domestic flights and organized flight personnel to the simulation training center for intensive on-site operations and rescue training. It has also distributed the company's own edited "Civil Aviation Passenger Ground Service Dialogue (English-Chinese)" to every employee. Additionally, the company has widely promoted the domestic situation to foreign friends and taken on the responsibility of organizing passenger sources.

    中国国际航空公司采取措施
    治理内部环境  提高服务技能
    本报北京七月三日讯　记者赵兴林报道：“一手抓生产，一手抓提高服务技能”的增收节支活动，目前正在中国国际航空公司展开。
    这个公司担负着三十二条国际航线和国内四十四条干线的飞行任务，虽说到今年七月一日公司才满一周岁，然而已显示出生机：一九八八年，完成运输总周转量近十亿吨公里，实现利润五点八亿元。随着飞行业务的发展，这个公司已购进一架波音七六七客机，还同外商签订再购买三架波音七四七客机合同。
    今年一至四月，这个公司各项生产指标均保持上升的好势头。进入五月以来，因受动乱和反革命暴乱的影响，生产经营受到较大损失。针对当前客源少的状况，公司及时调整国内飞行航班班次，组织飞行人员到模拟机培训中心加强实地操作、救护训练，并把本公司负责编写的《民航客运地面服务会话（英汉对照）》发给每个职工。此外，还广泛向外国朋友宣传我国内形势，担负起组织客源的重担。
