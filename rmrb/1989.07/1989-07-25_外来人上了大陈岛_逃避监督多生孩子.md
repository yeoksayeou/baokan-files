Dachen Island is located on the continental shelf in the central coastal area of Zhejiang Province. During the fishing season, the floating population on the island reaches tens of thousands. Among them, many people come to evade family planning policies. Some people get off the boat and onto the island, either building sheds or borrowing empty rooms to stay in. Men go out to sea, and women stay on the island to give birth and raise children. We saw a fisherman from Wenzhou at Zhongzui Pier; his wife has already given birth to three girls, and recently gave birth to a boy on Dachen Island. Dachen Town Party Committee Secretary Chen Xiaofa told us: The town has repeatedly mobilized outsiders on the island to voluntarily take family planning measures, but with little effect.

    外来人上了大陈岛
    逃避监督多生孩子
    大陈岛位于浙江中部沿海大陆架上，渔汛季节，岛上的流动人口达两三万人。其中不少人是为了逃避计划生育而来的。有些人下船上岛，或搭棚筑屋，或借宿空闲房中，男人出海，女人在岛上生儿育女。我们在中咀码头见到一个温州渔民，他妻子已生有3个女孩，最近在大陈岛又生了个男孩。大陈镇党委书记陈小法告诉我们：镇上曾几次动员岛上外来人自觉采取计划生育措施，但成效不大。
