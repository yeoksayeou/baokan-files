The vast desert, picturesque fields, and bustling life... The exhibition "The Charm of Western Frontier Agricultural Reclamation" opened today at the Beijing Art Museum, showcasing to the capital's audience a series of vivid and authentic scenes from the northwestern frontier and the vibrant life of the agricultural reclamation workers.

This exhibition, jointly organized by the China Photographers Association, the China Agricultural Reclamation Photographers Association, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, features 100 photographs taken by the hardworking agricultural reclamation builders. The images vividly depict the spirit of the corps soldiers in "settling and guarding the frontier" and the construction of two civilizations. The works reflect the unique feelings of the producers towards life and art, with diverse styles and fresh tones, embodying the fusion of art and life.

The Production and Construction Corps was established by the demobilized troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army that entered Xinjiang. Over the past 40 years, it has developed into a large-scale agricultural reclamation enterprise with 172 state-owned farms, 190 industrial and commercial enterprises, and 139 commercial enterprises in the Tian Shan region. Last year, the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 5.3 billion yuan. This photography exhibition is a gift from the corps to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.

Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Hab Comber, Saifuding Aizizi, and Liu Jiang, Wu Yinxiang, Chen Bo, and Yuan Yiping, along with more than 200 people from various circles in the capital, attended the opening ceremony today.

    《西域农垦风采》在京展示
    本报七月二十二日讯　广袤的沙海，如画如诗的条田，如火如荼的生活……今天在北京美术馆揭幕的西域农垦风采展览，向首都观众展示了一幅幅西北边陲瑰丽真切的画面和农垦人火热的生活。
    这次由中国摄影家协会、中国农垦摄影协会和新疆生产建设兵团联合主办的展览，一百幅照片都出于艰苦奋斗的农垦建设者之手。图片较充分地体现了兵团战士在“屯垦戍边”和两个文明建设中的风采。作品中融进了生产者们对于生活和艺术的独特感受，风格多样，格调清新，是艺术与生活的结晶。
    生产建设兵团是由原中国人民解放军进疆部队转业组建的，四十年来在天山南北已发展成为拥有一百七十二个国营农场，一百九十个工交企业，一百三十九个商业企业的大型农垦企业，去年工农业总产值达五十三亿元。这次摄影展览，是兵团人献给建国四十周年的礼物。
    全国人大常委会副委员长习仲勋、赛福鼎·艾则孜和刘江、吴印咸、陈勃、袁毅平等首都各界人士二百多人出席了今天的开幕式。
