The plan for the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and torch relay of the 11th Asian Games has been finalized after multiple revisions by relevant parties. The organizing committee, responsible for these activities, introduced the aforementioned plan to the media this afternoon in Beijing.

It is understood that the opening ceremony of the 1990 Beijing Asian Games will be held at 5 PM on September 22 at the Beijing Workers' Stadium. According to the regulations of the Asian Games Federation, the opening ceremony will consist of three parts: the parade, flag-raising and torch lighting, and group gymnastics. Before the parade, there will be a 40-minute performance featuring a military band procession, a demonstration of Tai Chi by Chinese and Japanese practitioners, and a parachute show.

The Asian Games torch will be lit on August 22, 1990, at Tiananmen Square and then transported by airplane to four endpoint cities in China: Harbin, Urumqi, Lhasa, and Haikou. From there, it will be relayed through 30 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, arriving in Beijing on September 20. The organizing committee will arrange for athletes from each participating team to carry the torch for the final leg, reaching the main venue of the Asian Games on September 22.

Since April of last year, experts in gymnastics, dance, and music from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Wuhan, and other places have been working diligently to complete the choreography for most of the group gymnastics performances. This one-hour-long large-scale group gymnastics performance is divided into six acts, including celebratory drumming, martial arts, children's gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, and acrobatics, with a total of 20,000 participants, including the backdrop stage. This autumn, the performers will begin full-scale rehearsals with costumes and props.

The closing ceremony of the Asian Games will be a grand celebration. Amidst a sea of joy with thousands of people, renowned Chinese artists and folk performers will present dozens of dazzling and unique performances, bringing the Asian sports festival to a climax. The closing ceremony will be held at 7 PM on October 7.

Relevant officials from the organizing committee stated that the design principles of these plans are to embody the spirit of unity, friendship, and progress, striving to achieve a lively yet simple atmosphere, with distinct Chinese characteristics and a contemporary feel.

    第十一届亚运会大型活动方案已定
    本报北京7月26日讯　记者汪大昭报道：第十一届亚运会开幕式、闭幕式及火炬传递方案，经有关方面多次修改，已于近日确定。组委会负责这些工作的大型活动部今天下午在京向新闻界介绍了上述方案。
    据了解，1990年北京亚运会开幕式将于9月22日下午5时在北京工人体育场举行。根据亚奥理事会章程的规定，开幕式将由入场式、升旗点火和团体操3部分组成。入场式前，将安排40分钟的军乐行进演奏、中日太极拳表演和跳伞表演。
    亚运会圣火将于明年8月22日在天安门广场点燃，用飞机传送至我国4个端点城市哈尔滨、乌鲁木齐、拉萨和海口。经30个省、市、区分路分段接力传递，于9月20日送到北京。组委会将安排各参赛代表团的选手作最后传递，22日抵达亚运会主会场。
    从去年4月开始，来自北京、上海、广东、武汉等地的体操、舞蹈、音乐等方面的专家，经过辛勤的创造，已完成团体操大部分场次的编排。这个长达1小时的大型团体操共分6场，包括欢庆锣鼓、武术、儿童操、韵律操、技巧等内容，连同背景台一起，参加表演者共有2万人。今年秋季，参演人员将全面开始服装、道具等的试用和动作训练。
    亚运会闭幕式将是一场盛大的联欢。在数千人汇成欢乐的海洋中，我国著名文艺工作者和民间艺人将以令人眼花缭乱而又独具特色的几十个节目，使亚洲体坛的盛会在高潮中落幕。闭幕式将于10月7日晚7点举行。
    组委会有关人士说，这些方案的设计原则是要体现团结、友谊、进步的精神，力争达到热烈而又简朴，具有中国特色和时代气息。
