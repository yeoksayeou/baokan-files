Hunan Province's Bureau of Geology and Mineral Resources recently discovered a lierite clay deposit in the Loudi area. After testing, the lierite content was found to be between 20% and 70%.

Lierite clay is a rare and economically valuable new type of clay mineral. It can be used as a highly efficient catalyst in the petroleum industry. It is also an excellent drilling mud material and can replace imported clay as a sizing agent for straw mats.

Currently, there are only three known lierite clay deposits in China. There are also few known lierite deposits abroad. The newly discovered lierite clay mineral belt in Hunan, stretching from Xinhua to Xiangtan, is over 100 kilometers long.

    湖南发现累托石粘土矿
    据新华社长沙7月29日电　（通讯员李刚、夏卫平）湖南省地质矿产局最近在娄底地区发现一处累托石粘土矿床，经测试，累托石含量达20％至70％。
    累托石粘土矿是目前稀缺和具有重要经济价值的新型粘土矿产，可用作急缺的石油高效催化剂。它也是一种优良泥浆材料，还可代替进口粘土作席草浆染的浆料。
    据了解，我国目前累托石粘土矿产地仅有3处。国外发现的累托石产地也不多。湖南发现的这条新化至湘乡累托石粘土成矿带长达百余公里。
