	Some West German Media Spread Rumors, Chinese Embassy Issues Statement to Refute

	BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Germany today issued a statement refuting rumors spread by some West German media.

	The statement said that Chinese students and visiting scholars are naturally concerned about the situation in their home country. The Chinese government has already expressed its tolerant attitude towards their signing petitions, holding meetings, and participating in demonstrations, as well as some of their more extreme actions, without seeking retribution. However, in recent times, some news media in the Federal Republic of Germany have spread rumors claiming that "fifty spies" have been sent to the Federal Republic of Germany to monitor Chinese students, threatening their safety; that photos and video recordings of their participation in demonstrations have been sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, causing them to fear persecution upon their return to China; and that a certain sinologist has fabricated claims that the Chinese Embassy is exerting pressure on "some students" by forcing them to renew their passports, among other things. In response, the Chinese Embassy solemnly declares the following: The Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Germany have never organized or engaged in any activities aimed at monitoring and threatening our own students studying abroad, such as conversations, surveillance, photography, or videotaping, among others. The reports by some news media in the Federal Republic of Germany regarding the above are groundless and constitute malicious slander and defamation against the Chinese government and the embassy.

	The statement said that the country and the people have high hopes for the students studying abroad. The Chinese Embassy hopes that Chinese students studying abroad will not believe the rumors and will discern right from wrong through in-depth understanding of the situation. The embassy hopes that the students will focus on their studies, return to China after completing their studies, and contribute their talents to the modernization of their homeland.

    西德某些新闻媒介散布谣言
    我大使馆发表声明予以驳斥
    本报波恩7月24日电　记者江建国报道：中国驻西德大使馆今天就西德某些新闻媒介散布谣言发表了一份声明。
    声明说，中国留学生和访问学者对国内形势的发展感到关切是完全正常的，对他们在不了解事实真相的情况下参加的签名、集会和游行等活动以及一些过激的言行，中国政府业已表明将采取宽容态度，不予追究。但是，一个时期以来，联邦德国的某些新闻媒介散布谣言说，已有“五十名奸细”派来联邦德国监视中国留学人员，留学人员的安全受到威胁；已将他们参加游行示威活动的照片、录像资料送往国内外交部，使他们担心回国后将受到迫害；某位汉学家竟无中生有地说，中国大使馆正通过强制更换新护照对“一些学生施加压力”；等等。对此，中国大使馆特郑重声明如下：中国政府和中国驻联邦德国大使馆从未组织或从事过以监视和威胁本国留学人员为目的的谈话、跟踪、拍照、录像等活动以及其他活动，联邦德国某些新闻媒介有关上述的报道是毫无根据的，是对中国政府和大使馆恶意中伤和污蔑。
    声明说，国家和人民对留学人员抱有殷切的希望，中国大使馆希望中国留学人员不要听信谣言，通过深入了解情况明辨是非。希望留学人员安心学习，学成后回国为祖国的现代化建设贡献自己的才智。
