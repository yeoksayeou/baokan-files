Xinhua News Agency, Lanzhou, July 29th.

The Lanzhou Military Region recently held a grand ceremony to commend 180 individuals who have dedicated themselves to building a strong foundation in the grassroots, highlands, and border areas. Leaders of the military region awarded them medals and called on all officers and soldiers in the region to learn from their example, dedicate themselves to national defense, and steadfastly guard the borders under harsh conditions.

The initiative to award medals to "old grassroots," "old highlands," and "old border" personnel is a measure taken by the Lanzhou Military Region to inspire soldiers to maintain their spirit of hard work and strengthen the construction of grassroots units. The troops of the Lanzhou Military Region are mostly stationed in the vast border regions of the wind-swept highlands and deserts, where the natural environment is harsh and living conditions are difficult. In recent years, various units have been conducting education campaigns focused on loving the country, the border, the people of all ethnic groups, and the vast northwest region. This has guided a large number of officers and soldiers to voluntarily carry forward the spirit of hard work and self-sacrifice, excel in their duties, and achieve outstanding results. Those who have been commended this time are representatives of these outstanding individuals.
