Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Youdao and People's Daily reporter Jia Jianzhou report from Jinan: The Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has focused on handling major and typical cases to concentrate efforts on combating corruption, conducting a thorough rectification of the Party's style from top to bottom.

In recent times, Shandong Province has made some progress in investigating and dealing with cases of disciplinary and legal violations, cleaning up and rectifying companies, and strengthening the construction of clean government. By the first half of this year, the province had uncovered more than 6,000 cases of disciplinary and legal violations, with over 4,000 cases already concluded. The province has dealt with 669 companies where government and enterprise functions were not separated, with 61% of them either dissolved or separated. Out of 1,210 Party and government officials holding concurrent positions in companies, 96.6% have resigned from one of their posts.

The Shandong Provincial Committee has implemented the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, listing the fight against corruption as an important part of strengthening Party building. Focusing on issues such as embezzlement, bribery, illegal business operations, wasteful spending, illegal construction, tax evasion, and the manufacture and sale of counterfeit and substandard goods, the province has handled a number of cases. At today's Provincial Committee meeting, the Provincial Committee specifically discussed the issue of combating corruption. Provincial Committee Secretary Jiang Chunquan emphasized that cases that have been investigated should be handled promptly and publicly; cases currently under investigation must be thoroughly investigated; and cases reported by the masses must be immediately investigated. Provincial Committee leaders must take the lead and carry out the anti-corruption struggle from top to bottom.

    从抓典型大案入手
    山东省惩治腐败
    本报济南7月5日电　中央人民广播电台记者李有道、本报记者贾建舟报道：中共山东省委从抓典型大案要案入手，集中力量向腐败现象开刀，自上而下认认真真地整顿党的作风。
    前一段，山东省在查处违纪违法案件、清理整顿公司、加强廉政建设等方面取得了一定成效。截至今年上半年，全省共查出违纪违法案件6000多件，其中已结案4000多件；查处政企不分的公司669家，其中已撤销和分开的占61％，在公司兼职的1210名党政干部有96.6％辞去了一头职务。
    山东省委贯彻十三届四中全会精神，把惩治腐败列入加强党的建设的一项重要内容，围绕贪污受贿、倒买倒卖、违法经营、挥霍浪费、乱建私房、偷税漏税、制造贩卖伪冒假劣商品等方面的问题，查处了一批案件。在今天召开的省委会议上，省委专门研究了惩治腐败的问题。省委书记姜春云强调指出，对已经查清的案件，要大张旗鼓地抓紧处理；对正在清查的案件，一定要查个水落石出；对群众举报揭发出来的案件，要立即组织力量清查。省委领导成员都要出征挂帅，自上而下地把反腐败斗争进行到底。
