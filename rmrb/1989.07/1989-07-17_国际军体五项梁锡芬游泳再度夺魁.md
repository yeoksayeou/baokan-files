The halfway point of the International Military Pentathlon was reached today. China's Xiang Xifen, who had already secured first place in the shooting event, once again emerged victorious in the obstacle swimming event with a time of 25.9 seconds. The Chinese team continues to lead the overall standings by a significant margin.

The swimming event in the military pentathlon covers 50 meters and includes obstacles such as wooden bars, platforms, and rafts. This is one of Xiang Xifen's strong suits, as he has often surpassed the world record of 25.5 seconds in his training. In today's competition, he performed exceptionally well in the first half but was affected in the second half, ultimately failing to break the record.

So far, Xiang Xifen and Yang Chunyi of the Chinese team have secured the first and second places in individual standings, respectively.
