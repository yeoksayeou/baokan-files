Prime Minister Shrestha emphasized that in the face of difficulties imposed by India on trade and transit issues, Nepal needs to redouble its efforts to achieve self-reliance and comprehensive national development.

Shrestha said at a meeting of the Nepal Chamber of Commerce that this sudden difficulty has set obstacles for the Nepalese people in meeting their basic needs by the end of this century.

He said, "We should learn from this difficulty and determine the direction of our economic development efforts according to our needs."

He said that overcoming the current difficulties requires coordination and understanding between the government and various non-governmental sectors. It is important at present to ensure the continuous supply of essential goods, control prices, reduce difficulties, and implement independent economic policies to achieve self-sufficiency and maintain national dignity.

Prime Minister Shrestha called on private enterprises to play their role, pool their strengths, expand the production of export products, and explore new markets.

    什雷斯塔首相强调
    尼泊尔要努力实现自力更生
    新华社加德满都7月25日电　尼泊尔首相什雷斯塔昨天强调说，面对印度在贸易和过境问题上给尼泊尔造成的困难，尼泊尔需要加倍努力来实现自力更生和国家全面发展的目标。
    什雷斯塔在尼泊尔工商联合会会议上说，这一突如其来的困难给尼泊尔人民在本世纪末满足基本需求设置了障碍。
    他说：“我们应该从这次困难中吸取教训，根据我们的需求来决定我们经济发展的努力方向。”
    他说，克服眼前的困难，需要政府与各非政府部门相互协调和理解。目前重要的是保持必需品的供应不断，控制物价，减少困难及实行独立的经济政策，以实现自给和维护民族尊严。
    什雷斯塔首相号召私营机构发挥作用，群策群力，扩大出口产品生产，开拓新市场。
