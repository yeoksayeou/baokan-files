From the Streets to the Grand Stage
– Written Before the Opening of the Third World Games

Have you ever seen a basketball court without a backboard?

Have you ever seen a soccer ball kicked with a bicycle?

Have you ever seen an ice hockey game not played on ice?

Can you imagine that tug-of-war and somersaults can also be part of a world championship?

The answer might be no. But if you are fortunate enough to come to Karlsruhe, West Germany, on July 20th, you will be amazed and delighted in just 10 days.

In Karlsruhe, from July 20th to 30th, the Third World Games will be held. The aforementioned items are just a small part of the 21 official competitions to be held at this World Games. Here, you can also appreciate the developed muscles of bodybuilders, the elegant style of water skiers, the power of karate and taekwondo, and the thrill of acrobatic cycling and figure skating. When male and female athletes compete in a "basketball match," you might find it amusing. If you are interested, you can also join the "athletes" and try your hand, because there are 25 projects for spectators to participate in.

This is the World Games.

The World Games, also known as the "Non-Olympic World Championships," are self-explanatory. All competitions held at the World Games are excluded from the Olympic Games and are not included in many traditional international competitions.

The World Games have only been around for 8 years. The first World Games were held in 1981 in Santa Clara, California, USA. In 1985, the second World Games were held in the British capital, London. Until today, the concept of the "World Games" may still be unfamiliar to many readers and viewers. Even for some professional reporters who have been engaged in sports reporting for many years, the competition projects and rules of the World Games may not be completely familiar. However, the World Games, as a "bridge" for promoting folk sports to the world, as a "compendium" of new mass sports projects, and as a necessary supplement to the Olympics, have already secured an indispensable place in the international sports arena in a short period of time.

This World Games has added new projects such as acrobatic cycling and bicycle ball. The number of people who have registered to participate in this World Games has reached more than 4,000, and the number of participating countries has increased to 60. It is worth mentioning that the World Games have been officially recognized by the International Olympic Committee. The International Olympic Committee will start to protect the World Games from this year, and Chairman Samaranch will preside over the opening ceremony in Karlsruhe. The World Games, this new member of the international sports arena, is becoming more and more significant.

    从街头巷尾到大雅之堂
    ——写在第三届世界运动会开幕之前
    你见过没有篮板的篮球场吗？
    你见过用自行车“踢”的足球吗？
    你见过不在冰上进行的冰球赛吗？
    你能想到，拔河和翻跟头也能参加世界大赛吗？
    回答也许是否定的。那么，如果你有幸于7月20日前来联邦德国的卡尔斯鲁厄的话，在10天时间里，你将大开眼界，大饱眼福。
    在卡尔斯鲁厄，7月20日至30日将举行第三届世界运动会，上述各项，只是本届世界运动会上将要进行的21项正式比赛中的一小部分。在这里，你还能欣赏到健美运动员的发达肌肉，滑水运动员的潇洒风采，你能领略到空手道和跆拳道的厉害，花样自行车和花样溜冰的惊险；而当男女运动员同场进行“篮球赛”时，你也许会忍俊不禁。如果有兴趣，你也可以加入到“运动员”队伍中去一试身手，因为这里还有25个项目是供观众亲自投身其中的。
    这就是世界运动会。
    世界运动会，又称“非奥运会项目世界比赛”。不言而喻，世界运动会上进行的所有比赛，都是被排除在奥运会的赛场之外的，也是诸多传统的国际性比赛所不包括的。
    世界运动会诞生才8年。第一届世界运动会是1981年在美国加利福尼亚州的圣克拉拉举行的。1985年，英国首都伦敦主办了第二届。直到今天，“世界运动会”这一概念在许多读者和观众的印象中可能仍很陌生，即使对一些多年从事体育报道的专业记者来说，世界运动会的部分比赛项目和规则也不一定完全熟悉。但是，世界运动会作为推动民间体育走向世界的“桥梁”，作为新兴大众性运动项目的“集大成者”，作为奥运会的必要补充，它已经在短短的时间内在国际体坛上争得了不可或缺的一席之地。
    本届世界运动会增加了花样自行车和自行车球等新项目。报名参加本届运动会比赛的人数达到了4000多人，国家发展到60个。值得一提的是，世运会已经得到了国际奥委会的正式承认。国际奥委会将从今年起施行对世界运动会的庇护，主席萨马兰奇将到卡尔斯鲁厄主持开幕式。世界运动会这一国际体坛的新生儿，正在越来越具规模。
