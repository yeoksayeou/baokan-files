Since January, the communication lines of a certain military airfield in Guangdong have been stolen five times. Fortunately, the backup communication antenna was not stolen at the same time, preventing a major disaster. The culprits were six students, aged 12 to 15, from a certain middle school. According to incomplete statistics from the First Communications Headquarters of the Guangzhou Military Region, from November 16, 1988, to April 3, 1989, military communication lines in Guangdong were stolen 33 times, totaling over 14,000 meters, causing significant economic losses and severely disrupting the normal operations of the troops.

The units responsible for maintaining the lines have taken various measures, such as setting up more guard posts and increasing patrols. However, due to the limited number of personnel and the extensive length of the lines, these efforts have had little effect. The relevant departments of the military have also requested assistance from the local county and city governments and public security authorities. Each time the lines are stolen, the military promptly reports the incident to the local public security authorities and requests investigation and punishment, but with little success. Once, after the coastal defense communication lines in a certain county were stolen, the military leadership personally invited the county magistrate and the head of the county public security bureau to inspect the scene. However, more than three months have passed, and there has been no news.

It is understood that the perpetrators are mostly transient criminals and local residents, with only a few being students. Many of the crime scenes are in densely populated areas, and some even occur in bustling commercial districts. Some crimes are committed in broad daylight. The stolen items are often openly sold to factories and scrap collection stations that need scarce raw materials.

We appeal to the relevant local authorities to take measures to promptly apprehend and punish those who steal military communication lines. At the same time, we hope that local party and government agencies, schools, and parents will strengthen education on national defense and legal awareness among the public, students, and children, and actively maintain the military communication lines and fight against illegal activities.

### 广东境内：  国防通信线路多次被盗

    广东境内：
    国防通信线路多次被盗
    1月以来，广东境内的某军用机场通信线路接连5次被盗，幸亏备用通信天线没有同时被盗，才未酿成大祸。盗线的团伙竟是某中学的6名12岁至15岁的学生。据广州军区第一通信总站不完全统计，去年11月16日至今年4月3日，广东境内国防通信线路共被盗33起，长达1.4万多米，造成了重大的经济损失，严重干扰了部队的正常工作。
    维护线路的部队采取了许多措施，如增设岗哨、加强巡逻，但因人少、点多、线长，收效甚微。部队有关部门也曾要求驻地县、市政府和公安机关协助；每次线路被盗，部队都及时向当地公安机关报案，请求查处，可是收效不大。一次，某县海防通信线路被盗后，部队领导专门请这个县的县长和县公安局负责同志察看了现场。但时过3个多月，仍无音讯。
    据了解，作案者除少数学生外，大部分是流窜犯和驻地居民。许多作案地点都发生在居民密集的地方，甚至发生在繁华闹市。有的竟然在光天化日之下作案。他们盗窃的赃物大都明目张胆地就地卖给一些需要紧缺原材料的工厂和废品收购站。
    呼吁地方有关部门采取措施，及时查获，依法惩处那些盗窃国防通信线路的不法分子。同时，希望地方党政机关、学校以及家长，加强对群众、学生、子女的国防观念教育和法制教育，自觉维护国防通信线路，积极同不法行为作斗争。
