Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 20th — (Reporter Xú Jīngyuè) Today marks exactly two months since martial law was declared in parts of Beijing. Life in Beijing is stable, and the martial law troops have effectively carried out their duties. The military and civilians understand each other.

At dawn, elderly people come to the streets and parks to exercise—some walk their birds, others practice swordplay, martial arts, or even old-style disco dancing, all in a relaxed manner. At intersections, soldiers in helmets and armed with rifles stand guard.

The road from Gōngzhǔfēn to Bāwángfēn, which was severely damaged during the turmoil, has been largely repaired. On this major east-west thoroughfare, tens of thousands of pedestrians pass by the soldiers calmly, often smiling at them.

The reporter observed that during the hottest days of summer in Beijing, many workers in factories, shops, and offices are putting in extra hours. In the bustling commercial district of Qianmen Dazhalan, red banners advertising "Summer Discount Week" attract throngs of customers. At the entrances of some well-known shops, salespeople call out to customers, and business is booming.

Today, the China International Exhibition Center is flying the flags of 24 countries and regions, including Denmark and Canada, as it hosts the first Beijing International Expo.

The world-famous Tiananmen Square has regained its solemn and dignified atmosphere. Under the 33-degree Celsius heat, the concrete tiles of the square radiate waves of heat, and the soldiers on duty are drenched in sweat. Here, both domestic and foreign tourists are undeterred, eagerly taking photos to remember the moment. Since its organized opening on July 1st, the square has welcomed tens of thousands of visitors.

It is understood that social order in Beijing is gradually stabilizing. After the suppression of the turmoil, criminal cases in Beijing have significantly decreased. Most of the scattered military weapons have also been recovered. Officials say that the stabilization of social order is largely due to the deterrent effect of the martial law troops standing guard day and night. Now, the number of troops in the city is gradually decreasing. Many residents are reluctant to see the soldiers leave.

    北京戒严两个月
    据新华社北京7月20日电　（记者徐京跃）今天，北京部分地区宣布戒严已整整两个月。北京市民生活安定，戒严部队有效地履行戒严职责，军民相互理解。
    黎明，老人来到街头草坪，溜鸟的，舞剑的，打拳的，跳老年迪斯科的，悠然自得。路口，头戴钢盔、手握钢枪的士兵肃立执勤。
    暴乱中路面受损最严重的公主坟至八王坟道路已基本修补完毕。这条横贯北京东西的要道上，成千上万的行人神色安详地从士兵面前通过，他们不时向士兵报以友善的微笑。
    记者观察，三伏天的北京，不少工厂、商店、机关的职工加班加点地工作。在繁华的前门大栅栏商业街，一条条“消夏让利周”的红色横幅吸引来摩肩接踵的顾客。一些老字号店铺门口，售货员挥汗吆喝，生意兴隆。
    今天，中国国际展览中心飘扬着丹麦、加拿大等24个国家和地区的旗帜，这里正举办首届北京国际博览会。
    世人瞩目的天安门广场早已恢复庄严肃穆。33摄氏度的高温下，广场水泥方砖腾起热浪，执勤的士兵汗透衣服。这里，中外游客兴致不减，竞相摄影留念。自从7月1日有组织开放以来，已接待数万人。
    据了解，北京市的社会秩序也趋于安定。平息暴乱后，北京市刑事案件大幅度下降。目前，部队失散的枪支大部分也已经收缴。有关人士称，社会秩序日趋安定的重要原因，是戒严部队官兵日夜执勤起了震慑作用。现在，市区部队日渐减少。许多群众对撤离的官兵依依不舍。
