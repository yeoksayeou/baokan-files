Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, July 4th — Jiangxi Province boasts a rich abundance of ancient tree resources. In recent years, the Jiangxi Provincial Forestry Department has organized a team of experts, scholars, and forestry workers to conduct a survey of the province's ancient trees. Their findings and research have been compiled into a book titled "Ancient Trees of Jiangxi," which is soon to be published.

The book includes 33 species, 65 genera, and 79 types of ancient trees, totaling 1045 individual trees. Among these, several have ages exceeding a thousand years. For instance, a ancient camphor tree in Yantian Township, Anfu County, is over 2000 years old. The Provincial Forestry Department has established records and protective measures for all the ancient trees surveyed.
