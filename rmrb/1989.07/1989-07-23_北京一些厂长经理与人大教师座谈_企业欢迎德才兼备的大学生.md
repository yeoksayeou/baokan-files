Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 23rd.

	"Enterprises welcome university graduates who are both morally and intellectually excellent, but do not welcome those who are talented but lack moral integrity." This was the opinion expressed by some enterprise leaders at a symposium recently held jointly by the Beijing Enterprise Managers Club and Peking University.

	The president of Peking University and advisor to the Beijing Enterprise Managers Club, Yuán Bǎohuá, presided over the symposium. He said that even in a university with a revolutionary tradition and strong party work like Peking University, various problems emerged during this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot. Some young students, graduate students, and a portion of young teachers had severe bourgeois liberalization thoughts, which exposed serious problems in our educational work.

	Li Dàlín, the director of the Beijing Construction Engineering Machinery Factory, said that the educational front should seriously reflect on this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot. What kind of people should higher education institutions cultivate? In the past, some university graduates, when assigned to a unit, did not ask about the work first but asked how much salary they would get and whether they could go abroad for further studies. Some university students also severely lacked a sense of labor and the spirit of hard struggle. He believed that from primary school onwards, education should emphasize communist ideals, respect for teachers, love of labor, and the spirit of hard struggle; it should not only emphasize intellectual education but also moral education.

	Zhèng Huánmíng, the general manager of the Beijing Automobile Industry Corporation, said that enterprises need talent because talent is the future of enterprises. However, what kind of talent do enterprises need? First, these talents must have a firm and correct political direction. Otherwise, no matter how talented a person is, if they do not work for socialism, it is as good as having no use. Secondly, they must be able to connect theory with practice. Some university students lack practical experience but have a high self-assessment. Some, upon arriving at a factory, demand several assistants, but they themselves may not even qualify as assistants.

	Wáng Yùyīng, the party secretary of the Chemical Plant No. 3 of the Yan Mountain Petrochemical Company, said that enterprises welcome university graduates with a strong sense of social responsibility and dedication. Some university students are unwilling to work at the grassroots level, and in recent years, the number of university students coming to factories has been decreasing. Some, even if they come, cannot endure hardships.

	Teachers from Peking University who participated in the symposium expressed their sincere hope that all sectors of society would care about the healthy growth of university students from various aspects.

	The State Council leader emphasized strengthening macro-control over computer software development, circulation, and use

	Beijing, July 23rd. According to information from relevant departments, recently, a State Council leader emphasized that it is necessary to strengthen macro-control over the development, circulation, and use of computer software and accelerate the process of software localization.

	China's computer industry is in its infancy, with a total installed capacity of 300,000 units, and it is still increasing at a rate of 70,000 units per year. However, the development and circulation of software, as the "soul" of computers, is in a state of macro-control failure and management chaos. The main manifestations are: unreasonable division of labor and layout in software development, with serious duplication; research and production are detached, and it is difficult to transform the developed software results into productive forces; the software market is sluggish; there is a lack of software copyright law, and there are no unified regulations in development, management, and use.

	In view of the above phenomena, the China Computer Technology Service Company, China Software Technology Company, and the Shanghai Microcomputer Application Society, among others, are inviting some famous experts and scholars in the country to review, sort out, and summarize the work in the software field in the previous stage according to the requirements of the State Council, striving to explore a new path to reverse the chaotic situation.

    北京一些厂长经理与人大教师座谈
    企业欢迎德才兼备的大学生
    新华社北京7月23日电  （记者夏俊生）“企业欢迎德才兼备的大学毕业生，而不欢迎有才无德的人。”这是一些企业负责人最近在首都企业家俱乐部与中国人民大学联合召开的座谈会上发表的意见。
    中国人民大学校长、首都企业家俱乐部顾问袁宝华主持了座谈会。他说，像人民大学这样具有革命传统、党的工作比较强的学校，在这次动乱和暴乱中还出现了各式各样的问题，一些青年学生、研究生和一部分青年教师资产阶级自由化思想严重，这暴露出我们教育工作存在着严重问题。
    北京建筑工程机械厂厂长李大林说，教育战线应当通过这场动乱和反革命暴乱认真反思，高等学校到底培养什么样的人。过去一些大学毕业生分配到单位不问工作如何，首先问的是拿多少钱，出国留学让不让走？一些大学生还严重缺乏劳动观念和艰苦奋斗的观念。他认为从小学起就应当加强对学生进行共产主义理想、尊重师长、热爱劳动、艰苦奋斗的教育；不能只重视智育，不重视德育。
    北京市汽车工业联合公司总经理郑焕明说，企业需要人才，因为人才是企业的未来。但是，企业需要什么样的人才呢？首先这些人才要有坚定正确的政治方向。不然，培养的人再有才干，不给社会主义干事，也等于没用，其次是能够理论联系实际。一些大学生缺乏实践经验，却对自己估计很高，有的一到工厂就要求给他配几个助手，其实他自己当助手还不一定合格。
    燕山石油化工公司化工三厂党委书记王玉英说，企业欢迎有强烈社会责任感和事业心的大学生。一些大学生不愿到基层工作，这几年到工厂的大学生越来越少了，有的即使来了也吃不得苦。
    参加座谈的中国人民大学的教师们，在发言中殷切希望社会各界从多方面关心大学生的健康成长。计算机软件重复开发严重国务院领导强调加强宏观控制
    本报北京7月23日讯　记者刘国胜从有关部门获悉：最近，国务院领导同志强调，要加强对计算机软件开发、流通和使用中的宏观控制，加速软件国产化进程。
    我国计算机事业方兴未艾，现有装机总容量已达30万台，并仍在以每年7万台的速度递增。但是，作为计算机“灵魂”——软件的开发和流通，却存在着宏观失控和管理混乱的局面。其主要表现是：软件开发分工和布局不合理，重复开发现象严重；科研和生产脱离，已开发出的软件成果很难转化成生产力；软件市场萧条；缺少软件版权法，在开发、管理和使用上没有统一法规。
    鉴于上述现象，中国计算机技术服务公司、中国软件技术公司和上海微型电脑应用学会等单位根据国务院的要求，正邀请国内部分著名专家学者对前一阶段软件领域的工作进行一次检验、整理和总结，力争为扭转混乱局面探索出一条新路子。
