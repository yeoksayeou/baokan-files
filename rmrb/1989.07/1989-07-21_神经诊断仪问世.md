A new clinical diagnostic device capable of precisely locating damage to the nervous system—the NDI Nervous System Diagnostic Instrument—has been put into clinical use at the Second Military Medical University's affiliated Longhai Hospital and the Shanghai Medical University's affiliated Children's Hospital, yielding satisfactory results. Shanghai medical experts have given this achievement high praise.

This nervous system diagnostic instrument was successfully developed by the Naval Medical Research Institute. It can perform multiple tasks including electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and visual, auditory, and somatosensory evoked potentials, recording and computer analyzing to determine the functional status of the peripheral neuromuscular system and central nervous system, as well as suspected lesions.
