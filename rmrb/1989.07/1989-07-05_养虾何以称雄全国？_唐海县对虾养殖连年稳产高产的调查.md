In recent years, marine aquaculture has surged like a tide along China's thousands of miles of coastline. Numerous "star" aquaculture operations have emerged in several coastal provinces. However, the most notable is Tanghai County in Hebei Province.

In 1987, the county achieved the top spot in the nation for shrimp yield per unit area, size, and economic benefits; in 1988, it again led the nation in yield per unit area, total yield, size, economic benefits, and foreign exchange earnings, earning $40 million in foreign exchange.

In just four years, what has driven Tanghai's aquaculture industry to such remarkable achievements?

From the top down, there is planned macro guidance; from the bottom up, there is the stimulation of producers' work enthusiasm.

Tanghai County is located on the Bohai Gulf and was formerly known as Bai Gezhuang Farm. During the reform process, Tanghai County, based on the characteristics of state-owned farms, has carefully explored and gradually perfected the "state development, individual contracting, mandatory unification, appropriate division, and unified management" operating system.

"Division" means that the state-developed 51,000 mu of shrimp ponds are contracted out to more than 2,000 workers, with two or three people per pond, and the contractors are responsible for managing the entire process from stocking, measuring, feeding, changing water, preventing disease, guarding, to harvesting. Economic benefits are linked to personal interests.

"Unification" means that on the basis of implementing the "three fixes" (fixed contract area, fixed size standards, fixed cost), the "five unifications" are implemented: unified production and supply of seedlings; unified management of water and electricity; unified formulation and processing of compound feed; unified formulation of technical measures and procedures according to standards; unified collection, transportation, storage, and sales of products. During the unification process, the county has newly built and expanded 19 aquaculture service organizations, strengthening the service.

The unified and divided operating system successfully embodies the state's planned guidance for shrimp farming, combining the micro-dispersed "cells" into a scientifically managed operating entity, and improving the overall benefits of shrimp farming for export and foreign exchange earnings.

After establishing the dual-layer management system, the county government strictly adheres to the value law, insisting on the principle of distribution according to labor, more labor, more pay, and formulating the "guaranteed profit, tiered progressive bonus" distribution policy, closely linking the production volume and size of the contractors with their personal income. Under the guarantee that the state gets the lion's share, the enterprise gets the middle share, and the individual gets the small share, the higher the benefits, the greater the proportion of workers' distribution, and the workers' high income also ensures the enterprise's high benefits. In 1988, the average yield per mu of the county's 51,000 mu of shrimp ponds increased by 26.5 kilograms compared to the previous year.

Not a moment is spared for science and technology, and attention is paid to popularizing it to everyone.

Tanghai County attaches importance to scientific and technological investment, specially establishing the Coastal Development Company, and each shrimp farm sets up a production technology office. Each production team is equipped with a technical personnel, and there are technical demonstration ponds in the farming process, forming a three-level scientific and technological service network at the county, farm, and team levels.

Initially, these technical personnel had low technical levels and lacked management experience. Among the more than 2,000 shrimp farming workers in the county, only 1% had obtained aquaculture professional titles. In recent years, they have invited experts and scholars from aquaculture colleges and research institutions to teach management cadres and technical personnel scientific and technological knowledge, helping to overcome difficulties in production. They also sent talented individuals with knowledge, brains, and a love for shrimp farming to various colleges and universities for further study, reserving technical strength. They have now trained 51 professional technical personnel. Shrimp farming workers have also universally received full technical training, making everyone understand the basic technical issues in shrimp farming production and become "mini-experts."

The popularization of technology has enabled Tanghai's shrimp farming industry to innovate in seedling cultivation, farming technology, and other aspects, forming many unique experiences and methods. For example, in seedling cultivation, they adopted the technical scheme of "processing water, raising temperature, satisfying feed, and promoting metamorphosis," bringing the seedling technology to a new level.

Shrimp farming has high technical requirements, and they have planned to tackle key technical issues such as black gill and rotten gill disease. Under the guidance of Sun Xiuqin, a physician and associate researcher at the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao Medical College, they successfully researched and developed a compound feed with antibacterial, antifungal, and growth-promoting effects, with satisfactory therapeutic effects.

Shrimp farming requires high investment, and in this regard, state-owned farms have played a role in their large scale and strong capabilities.

Increasing material input is another important reason for Tanghai County's high returns in shrimp farming. Since 1985, a total of more than 100 million yuan has been invested, achieving the matching construction of breeding, farming, water supply, cold storage, and road transportation. In 1988 alone, the county's 8 farms built 311 new shrimp ponds, increasing the area of farm and county-operated shrimp ponds to 51,000 mu, an increase of 16,000 mu from the previous year, and also contracted shrimp ponds across provinces and counties totaling 5,600 mu.

The supporting facilities for shrimp farming have also become more complete. In 1988, the county and farm levels invested a total of 40 million yuan, increasing the number of hatcheries from 3 to 6, breeding 18.8 billion shrimp seedlings, an increase of 5 billion from the previous year. They also built 5 advanced cold storage plants, increasing the daily freezing capacity from 72 tons to 185 tons.

In the shrimp farming stage, the investment of circulating funds is particularly astonishing. The county's 51,000 mu of intensive shrimp ponds, during the peak feeding period, invest 10 million yuan worth of natural feed such as razor clams and brine shrimp, and compound feed every day. In this regard, they have played the role of collective scheduling. High investment, high output, high benefits. In 1988, the county's total shrimp production was 11.15 million kilograms, and the export value of finished shrimp reached more than 200 million yuan, accounting for approximately 40% of the county's total industrial and agricultural output value. Shrimp farming has truly become an important pillar of Tanghai County's economy.

    养虾何以称雄全国？
    ——唐海县对虾养殖连年稳产高产的调查
    李景祥　丁俊杰　么志远
    近年，海水养殖像一股大潮在我国千里海疆悄然涌动。沿海数省出现无数养殖“明星”。然而，最引人注目的要数河北省唐海县。
    1987年，该县夺得对虾单产、规格和效益3个全国第一；1988年在全国又荣获单产、总产、规格、效益、创汇5项第一，创汇4000万美元。
    4年，仅仅4年，是什么促使唐海养殖业取得如此效果？
    上，能有计划进行宏观指导；下，能激发生产者的劳动热情
    唐海县地处渤海湾，前身是柏各庄农场。在改革中，唐海县根据国营农场的特点，认真探索，逐步完善了“国家开发，个人承包，需统必统，宜分则分，统分结合”的经营体制。
    分，即把国家开发的5.1万亩虾池承包给2000多名工人，二或三人一池，分池承包。承包者负责管理从放苗、测苗、投饵、换水、防病、看管到出虾的整个养成过程。经济效益与个人利益挂钩。
    统，即在实行“三定”（定承包面积、定规格标准、定成本费用）的基础上，实行“五个统一”，即统一生产和供应苗种；统一管理水电；统一配制、加工合成饵料；按规范统一制定技术措施和规程；统一收、运、贮、销产品。在统的过程中，全县新建、扩建了19个养殖服务组织，强化了服务。
    统分结合的经营体制，成功地体现了国家对养虾的计划指导，把微观分散的“细胞”结合成管理科学的经营整体，提高了养虾出口创汇的整体效益。
    双层经营体制确立以后，县政府严格按价值规律办事，坚持按劳分配、多劳多得的原则，制定了“保本分档累进提成”的分配政策，把产量高低、规格大小与承包者个人的收入紧密挂钩。在保证国家得大头，企业得中头，个人得小头的情况下，效益越高，职工分配比重越大，而职工高收入又保证了企业高效益。1988年全县5.1万亩虾池平均亩产比上年增加了26.5公斤。
    一时一刻也不放松科学技术，并注意普及到每一个人
    唐海县重视科技投入，专门设立了沿海开发公司，各养虾场设生产技术办公室，每个生产队配一名技术员，养成中有技术典型示范池，全县形成县、场、队三级科技服务网络。
    起初，这些科技人员技术水平较低，缺乏管理经验。全县2000多名养虾职工，取得水产专业职称的仅占1％。近几年他们请来水产大专院校、科研单位的专家、学者，为管理干部、技术人员讲授科技知识，帮助攻克生产中的难关。还选派有知识、有头脑、热爱养虾事业的人才到各大专院校进修学习，储备技术力量。现已培养专业技术人员51名。养虾职工也普遍接受了全员技术培训，使每一个人都懂得养虾生产中的基本技术问题，成为“小专家”。
    技术的普及，使唐海的养虾业在育苗、养成技术等方面都有创新，形成了许多独特的经验和方法。如育苗中，他们采取了“处理水，提高温，满足饵，促变态”的技术方案，使育苗技术达到了一个新的水平。
    对虾养殖技术性要求较高，他们有计划地对黑腮、烂腮病等难治之症，开展了科技攻关。在青岛医学院附属医院医师、副研究员孙修勤指导下，研究成功具有抗细菌、抗真菌、促生长的中西合成药饵，疗效颇令人满意。
    养虾需要高投入，在此，国营农场发挥了规模大、实力强的作用
    增加物质投入是唐海县养虾夺得高效益的又一个重要原因。1985年以来，累计投入1亿多元，实现了育种、养成、供水、冷储和公路运输的配套建设。仅1988年，全县8个农场兴建虾池311个，使场办、县办虾场面积达到5.1万亩，比上年增加1.6万亩，还跨省、跨县承包虾池5600亩。
    养虾配套工程也更趋完善，1988年县、场两级共投资4000万元，使育苗室由3座增加到6座，繁育虾苗18.8亿尾，比上年增加5亿尾。他们还新建了5座设备先进的冷冻厂，日速冻能力由72吨增加到185吨。
    在对虾养成阶段，流动资金投入十分惊人，全县的5.1万亩精养对虾池，在投喂的高峰期，一天就投入价值100万元的兰蛤、卤虫等天然饵料和合成饵料。在此，他们发挥了集体调度能力。高投入，换回高产出、高效益。1988年，全县养虾总产1115万公斤，出口成品虾创汇产值达2亿多元，约占全县工农业总产值的40％。养虾业真正成了唐海县经济的重要支柱。
