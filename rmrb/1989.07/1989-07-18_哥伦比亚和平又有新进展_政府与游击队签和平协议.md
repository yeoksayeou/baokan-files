Colombia's government and the guerrilla organization "April 19 Movement" yesterday signed a new peace agreement regarding the disarmament of this guerrilla force.

The agreement stipulates the establishment of a committee composed of representatives from both the guerrilla group and the government. This committee will be responsible for studying the specific steps to disarm the guerrillas and transform them into a legal political organization. These steps include: legal and political guarantees for the guerrillas to reintegrate into civilian life, as well as security measures for their future political activities; technical details for the demilitarization of the guerrillas; conditions and deadlines for amnesty; and support for the "April 19 Movement" to form a political party after laying down their arms, among other things.

The leader of the "April 19 Movement," Pizarro, issued a statement from his base, reaffirming the guerrilla group's support for the domestic peace process.

Colombia's peace process has made new progress in recent times. In addition to the negotiations between the government and the "April 19 Movement" coming to a close, the government has decided to engage in direct talks with several other guerrilla groups, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. Currently, only the National Liberation Army is insisting on armed struggle and unwilling to participate in the peace process.

    哥伦比亚和平又有新进展  政府与游击队签和平协议
    本报加拉加斯7月18日电　记者朱满庭报道：哥伦比亚政府和游击队组织“四·一九运动”昨天签署了一项关于解除这支游击队武装问题的一项新和平协议。
    协议规定建立一个由游击队和政府双方代表组成的委员会，负责研究使游击队放下武器，变为一支合法的政治组织的具体步骤。这些步骤是：对游击队加入平民生活的司法和政治保障以及游击队成员今后从事政治活动的安全措施；游击队非军事化的技术细节；大赦的条件与期限以及对“四·一九运动”放下武器后组织政党的支持等等。
    签署这一协议的“四·一九运动”领导人皮萨罗在其驻地同时发表声明，重申了这支游击队支持国内和平进程的立场。
    哥伦比亚和平进程近期又有了新的进展。除了政府与“四·一九运动”之间的谈判已告一段落外，政府已决定同哥伦比亚武装部队等另外几支游击队进行直接谈判。目前坚持武装斗争，不愿参加和平进程的只有民族解放军一支游击队了。
