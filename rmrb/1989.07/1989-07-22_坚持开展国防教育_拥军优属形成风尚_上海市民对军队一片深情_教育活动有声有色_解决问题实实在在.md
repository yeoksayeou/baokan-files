Shanghai residents, who 40 years ago welcomed the People's Liberation Army into the city with unprecedented enthusiasm, still hold deep affection for the military today. Shanghai persists in conducting national defense education as a fundamental project of urban ideological construction and as an important topic for improving the quality of its citizens. It distinguishes different levels and uses various forms to carry out rich and colorful national defense education among the people, forming a good tradition of "loving the military and respecting soldiers" across the city. On the eve of Army Day, the city made new arrangements for supporting the military and favorably treating military families.

The tradition of military-civilian unity in Shanghai dates back to Comrade Chen Yi's tenure as mayor. In recent years, the Municipal Party Committee has often educated Party members and the people to see Shanghai's important role in national economic construction and its equally important role in national defense construction. They understand the principle that "though the world is at peace, the country cannot be without defense for a single day," and carry forward the good tradition left by Comrade Chen. The Municipal Party Committee's leading cadre actively participate in national defense education activities. Whenever there are significant military activities, the city's top leaders always make time to participate in person. In the past year alone, Secretary Jiang Zemin and Mayor Zhu Rongji participated in military activities and national defense education activities more than 10 times. The Municipal Party Committee also decided that every July, the Standing Committee would collectively listen to a comprehensive report on the military work of the Garrison Command. The Municipal Party Committee, in response to the actual changes in the structure of leading cadres, has organized city-level and above cadres to participate in "One Day in the Military Camp" activities in garrison units, allowing leading cadres to have discussions with soldiers and participate in shooting exercises, helping them to understand the military and care about national defense. They also often use report meetings, lectures, and cadre training opportunities to carry out national defense education activities. In the past two years, more than 7,000 county and department-level cadres have participated in various national defense education activities.

To strengthen national defense education throughout the city, Shanghai has successively opened more than 800 national defense education sites, including "National Defense Park," "Youth Military Camp," and "Youth Military School." The National Defense Park located in Tianzifeng Park in Shanghai is the first park in China that integrates sightseeing and leisure with national defense education. In less than two years since its opening, it has already received 840,000 visitors. In Shanghai's main streets, parks, youth palaces, and other public places, there are lifelike revolutionary hero statues and fixed national defense galleries and display windows. Shanghai's newspapers, radio stations, and television stations have opened columns and special programs such as "National Defense World" and "Contemporary Soldiers." Every year on Army Day, National Day, and the Spring Festival, Shanghai holds city-wide national defense education activities, integrating national defense education into the work, life, and entertainment of its citizens.

In-depth and solid national defense education activities have formed a good tradition of "loving the military and caring about national defense" in Shanghai. The Municipal Party Committee pays great attention to the scientific and cultural education of garrison soldiers. Various sectors of the city have carried out intellectual support for the military, with more than 900 units establishing long-term and stable joint construction and cultivation relationships with the garrison. Nearly a thousand experts, scholars, and senior technical personnel regularly teach knowledge and technology in the military camp. Shanghai also adopts the method of "providing policies, technology, and projects" to help the garrison develop production and operations, and cares about the "vegetable basket" project of the units. In Shanghai, "soldiers first" and "military families first" have become a principle that citizens consciously follow in their daily lives. Whether it is at stations, docks, or stores, you can see signs such as "soldiers' ticket windows," "soldiers' waiting rooms," and "soldiers' special counters" everywhere. Famous cultural activity venues such as the Shanghai Daguangming Cinema have, for 40 years since liberation, always had reserved tickets for soldiers. Some restaurants on Nanjing Road have specially set up "soldiers' special tables" to facilitate the dining of passing soldiers. The city's more than 4,900 support-the-military and favorably-treat-military-families service networks, composed of various industries, are spread throughout the streets and alleys, helping more than 50,000 military families solve difficulties. On the eve of Army Day, Shanghai organized a special team to visit the homes of Shanghai soldiers participating in the capital's martial law enforcement, with leaders personally solving practical problems, allowing these soldiers to be free from worries at home.

    坚持开展国防教育　拥军优属形成风尚
    上海市民对军队一片深情
    教育活动有声有色　解决问题实实在在
    本报讯　40年前曾以空前的热情欢迎人民解放军入城的上海人，今天对军队依然是一片深情。上海坚持把国防教育作为城市思想建设的一项基础工程，作为提高市民素质的一个重要课题，区别不同层次，运用多种形式，在人民群众中开展丰富多彩的国防教育，使全市各界形成了“热爱军队、尊重军人”的良好风尚。建军节前夕，该市对拥军优属工作又作出了新的安排。
    上海的军民团结从陈毅同志在上海担任市长起一直有个好传统。近年来，市委经常教育党员和人民既要看到上海在国家经济建设中的重要地位，又要看到上海在国防建设中的重要作用，懂得“天下虽安、国不可一日无防”的道理，把陈老总留下的好传统发扬光大。市委一班人带头参加国防教育活动。凡是比较大的军事活动，市主要领导总是挤出时间亲自参加，仅去年以来，江泽民书记、朱熔基市长参加军事活动和国防教育活动就达10余次。市委还确定，每年7月，常委集体听取警备区军事工作的全面汇报。市委还针对领导干部结构变化的实际，有计划地组织全市局级以上干部到驻军连队参加“军营一日活动”，让领导干部们和士兵座谈、参加打靶，使他们理解军队、关心国防。他们还经常利用报告会、讲座、干部培训等机会开展国防教育活动，两年来，全市参加各类国防教育活动县、处级干部达7000余名。
    为了加强全市的国防教育，上海先后开辟了“国防园”、“青少年军事营地”、“少年军校”等800多处国防教育的场所。位于上海天山公园内的国防园是我国第一个把游赏小憩与国防教育相融一体的园地，开园不到两年，就已接待了84万人次。在上海的主要街道、公园、少年宫等公共场所，还设有栩栩如生的革命英雄塑像和固定的国防画廊、橱窗。上海的报纸、电台、电视台开辟了“国防天地”、“当代军人”等专栏和专题节目。每逢建军节、国庆节、春节，上海都要举办全市规模的国防教育活动，使国防教育相融于市民的工作、生活和娱乐之中。
    深入扎实的国防教育活动，使上海蔚然形成了“热爱军队、关心国防”的良好风尚。市委非常关心驻军官兵的科学文化教育，全市各界开展智力拥军，有900多家单位与驻军建立了长期稳固的共建共育关系，近千名专家、学者和高中级技术人员常年在军营传授知识和技术。上海还采取“给政策、给技术、给项目”的办法，帮助驻军发展生产经营，关心连队的“菜篮子”工程。在上海，“军人优先”、“军属优先”已是市民在日常生活中自觉遵循的一条准则。无论是车站、码头，还是商店，到处都可以看到“军人售票窗口”、“军人候车室”、“军人专柜”等醒目牌子。著名的上海大光明电影院等一批文化活动场所解放40年来，一直设有军人保留票。南京路上的一些饭店，为了方便过往军人的就餐，专门开设了“军人专桌”。全市4900多个由各行各业组成的拥军优属服务网点遍布大街小巷，为5万余户烈军属排忧解难。建军节前夕，上海又组织专门力量，逐户了解参加首都戒严的上海籍官兵的家庭困难，领导亲自上门解决实际问题，使这些官兵解除了后顾之忧。
