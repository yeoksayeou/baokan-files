From October 1987 to October 1988, the City North Township in our county spent 14,250.73 yuan on feasts and entertainment alone, totaling 365 instances. Township officials almost drank alcohol every day, with 75 instances of them treating themselves. In the records of feasts and entertainment, reasons included celebrating the New Year, celebrating victory over drought, mediating a couple's dispute, and learning to catch soft-shelled turtles. There was an unwritten rule: officials who did not participate in group feasts would receive a 5 yuan subsidy each time. The township party committee secretary even explicitly stated that officials returning late from fieldwork could use public funds to eat at restaurants. When they went to administrative villages, they demanded food without hesitation. Some village officials helplessly said, "Township officials come just to eat. They come in groups, not just one or two, and set up several tables of banquets, making people headache!"

The 14,000-plus yuan spent on feasts and entertainment by City North Township in a year was almost entirely against policy, collected from the people by adding extra charges. In the first quarter of 1988, the suburban district allocated 316 pigs for purchase to this township, but they actually distributed 340 pigs to various administrative villages. When they collected 172 pigs, the higher authorities no longer demanded more. The remaining 168 pigs they continued to demand from the people, and they wanted money instead of pigs. They collected 80 yuan per pig for the price difference, totaling 9,117 yuan, which was not handed over to the township finance. In December 1987, this township did not complete the autumn grain storage task, and the higher authorities required funds to make up the price difference between the planned price and the market price, setting a standard. They did not follow the higher authorities' regulations but took the opportunity to add extra charges, resulting in an additional collection of over 2,000 yuan. The extra amount was not handed over to the finance but was used as the township's own funds. In collecting property insurance fees and levying over-quota birth control fees, they also used this method of adding extra charges to collect more. In 1988, the railway department built 4 level crossings in the City North Township area, allocating 5,281 yuan for earthwork to this township. They actually used 4,100 yuan, but the remaining funds were not only withheld but also levied 2,190 yuan from the people, all used for feasts and entertainment. Using this method of adding extra charges, City North Township collected over 17,000 yuan from the people in the first half of 1988 alone. It is understood that the per capita income of this township last year was only 279 yuan, while the per capita burden was 299 yuan. A farmer who participated in the construction of the railway level crossings angrily said, "In winter, I eat cold flatbread while working on the earth, but the money that should be given to me is not only not given, but I am also asked to pay out. What they eat and drink is the blood and sweat of the common people!"

The township's civil affairs income, public security fines, and extra property insurance fees were all managed by individual officials, actually becoming "small treasuries." During collective approvals, party committee members could take out their own expense vouchers and sign and stamp them. All 7 party committee members forgot their principles for personal gain and privately divided 2,450 yuan of public funds under the pretext of buying coats and electric fans. The party committee also stipulated that township officials could keep 10% of the funds collected from livestock and family planning as personal bonuses. Last year, in the first half of the year, just the two items of family planning and livestock collection took out 4,612 yuan and distributed it to individuals. These behaviors of spreading, commissioning, and embezzling public funds and public property, which violate the party's policies and principles, were not opposed or refused by any party committee member. It is understood that for those who could not pay on time or could not pay, township officials did not do ideological work but used strong measures such as pulling pigs and sheep, carrying tables, and pushing bicycles, seriously damaging the relationship between the party and the people, and causing the people to have an opposing attitude towards the party and the government.

Based on the above errors, the county party committee decided: to reorganize the City North Township Party Committee, remove Ruan Xingjie from the position of township party committee secretary, and reduce his salary by two levels; remove Hou Zhiguo from the position of township party committee deputy secretary, and all township party committee members' positions were removed. At the same time, the county government decided to remove Hou Zhiguo from the position of township head and reduce his salary by two levels. The county discipline inspection commission has reported the handling of this case to all levels of party organizations in the county.

    贪口福  城北乡党委四处刮钱
    惩腐败  太和县党委严肃查处
    1987年10月至1988年10月，我县城北乡仅用于吃喝招待的公款就达14250.73元，共365次。乡干部几乎天天都有酒喝，其中75次是自己招待自己。在吃喝招待统计表里，吃喝的原因有：庆祝元旦、庆祝抗旱胜利、为某某夫妻劝架、学捉老鳖，等等。他们有一个不成文的规定：凡没有参加集体吃喝的干部，每人每次补助5元。乡党委书记还明确宣布：干部下乡回来晚了，可以用公款到饭馆吃饭。他们下到行政村，也毫无顾忌地要着吃。有的村干部无可奈何地说：“乡干部就是为了吃才来的。一来就不是一个两个人，一摆就是几桌酒席，真叫人头疼！”
    城北乡一年吃喝的14000多元几乎都是违背政策，从群众身上加码征收来的。1988年第一季度，城郊区分给这个乡316头生猪收购任务，他们实际上向各行政村分配340头。当他们征购到172头猪时，上级不再追要了。剩下的168头猪他们继续向群众追要，并且要钱不要猪。每头猪收平价与议价的差价款80元，共收取了9117元，未上交乡财政。1987年12月，这个乡秋粮入库任务没完成，上级要求用款补齐平价与议价之间的价差，并规定了标准。他们不按上级的规定，趁机加码，结果多收了2000多元，多收部分也不上交财政，而作为乡的自有资金。在收家产保险费和征收超计划生育抚育费等工作中，他们也都采用这种加码手段多收多要。1988年，铁路部门在城北乡境内建4个平交道口，拨给这个乡土方款5281元。他们实际上使用4100元，剩余款项不仅扣留了，而且还向群众摊派2190元，全部用以吃喝招待了。就是用这种加码的办法，仅1988年上半年，城北乡就从群众身上多征了17000元。据了解，这个乡去年人均收入只有279元，而人均负担达299元。一位参加过修铁路平交道口的农民气愤地说：“冬天，俺啃着凉馍拉土干活，该给俺的钱不但不给，还叫俺往外掏钱。他们吃的、喝的都是俺老百姓的血汗！”
    这个乡的民政收入、治安罚没款、多收的家产保险费等款项，都分散在干部个人手里保管，实际上成了一个个“小金库”。每逢集体审批时，党委成员可以拿出自己经手开支的单据互相签报，盖章了事。7名党委成员全都见利忘义，他们以买大衣、买电风扇为名，私分公款2450元。党委还规定，乡里的干部在生猪、计划生育等收款工作中，谁收的款，可以将收款的10％作为个人奖金留下。去年上半年，仅计划生育和生猪两项收款，就提取了4612元兑现给个人。这些违反党的方针政策的摊派、提成和侵吞公款公物行为，党委成员中竟无一人拒绝或反对。据了解，对不能及时交款和交不起款的群众，乡干部不去做思想工作，而是采取牵猪牵羊、抬桌子、推自行车等强硬措施，严重败坏了党群关系，造成了群众对党和政府的对立情绪。
    根据以上错误事实，我县县委决定：改组中共城北乡委员会，撤销王心敬乡党委书记职务、降两级工资；撤销侯治国乡党委副书记职务，全体乡党委委员职务均被免除。同时，县政府决定撤销侯治国的乡长职务，降两级工资。县纪委已将此案处理情况通报到全县各级党组织。
