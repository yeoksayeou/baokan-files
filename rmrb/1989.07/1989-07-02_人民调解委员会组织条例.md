Article 1: To strengthen the construction of People's Mediation Committees, to promptly mediate civil disputes, to promote unity among the people, to maintain social stability, and to facilitate the modernization of socialism, these regulations are formulated.

Article 2: People's Mediation Committees are mass organizations under the Village Committees and Resident Committees for mediating civil disputes, and they operate under the guidance of grassroots people's governments and grassroots people's courts.

The daily work of People's Mediation Committees is guided by the legal assistants of the grassroots people's governments and their dispatched agencies.

Article 3: People's Mediation Committees consist of 3 to 9 members, with one chairperson, and a vice-chairperson may be appointed if necessary.

Members of People's Mediation Committees, except those who are also members of Village Committees or Resident Committees, are elected by the masses and are elected every three years, with the possibility of re-election.

In multi-ethnic residential areas, People's Mediation Committees should include members from ethnic minorities with smaller populations.

If a member of a People's Mediation Committee is unable to serve, a replacement should be elected by the original election unit.

Members of People's Mediation Committees who are seriously derelict in their duties or engage in illegal activities should be replaced by the original election unit.

Article 4: Adult citizens who are fair, have good relations with the masses, are dedicated to mediation work, and have a certain level of legal knowledge and policy understanding can be elected as members of People's Mediation Committees.

Article 5: The tasks of People's Mediation Committees are to mediate civil disputes and, through mediation work, to propagate laws, regulations, rules, and policies, to educate citizens to observe laws and regulations, and to respect social ethics.

People's Mediation Committees should report the situation of civil disputes and mediation work to the Village Committees or Resident Committees.

Article 6: The mediation work of People's Mediation Committees should adhere to the following principles:

(1) Mediation should be conducted in accordance with laws, regulations, rules, and policies. If laws, regulations, rules, and policies do not have clear provisions, mediation should be conducted in accordance with social ethics;

(2) Mediation should be conducted on the basis of voluntary and equal participation by both parties;

(3) The litigation rights of the parties should be respected, and parties should not be prevented from suing in the people's courts because they have not undergone mediation or because mediation has failed.

Article 7: People's Mediation Committees should promptly mediate disputes upon the request of the parties; if the parties do not request mediation, they can also take the initiative to mediate.

People's Mediation Committees can mediate disputes by one or more members; disputes involving multiple regions or units can be jointly mediated by the relevant mediation organizations.

People's Mediation Committees can invite relevant units and individuals to participate in the mediation of disputes. The invited units and individuals should provide support.

Article 8: People's Mediation Committees should mediate disputes on the basis of investigating the facts and clarifying the issues, fully explaining the reasons, patiently guiding, removing misunderstandings, and helping the parties to reach an agreement.

Dispute mediation should be recorded, and a record should be made. If necessary or at the request of the parties, a mediation agreement can be made. The mediation agreement should be signed by both parties and the mediators and stamped with the seal of the People's Mediation Committee.

Article 9: The mediation agreement reached under the auspices of the People's Mediation Committee should be performed by the parties.

If the parties do not reach an agreement after mediation or if they reach an agreement but later change their minds, either party can request the grassroots people's government to handle the matter or sue in the people's court.

Article 10: Grassroots people's governments should support mediation agreements reached under the auspices of People's Mediation Committees that comply with laws, regulations, rules, and policies; those that violate laws, regulations, rules, and policies should be corrected.

Article 11: People's Mediation Committees do not charge fees for mediating civil disputes.
