Rajiv Gandhi Visits Pakistan

Meets with Pakistani Prime Minister and President

Our correspondent Ren Yujun reports from Islamabad, July 16: Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi arrived in Islamabad today for a one-day visit to Pakistan, where he held talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and met with President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.

Rajiv Gandhi's visit to Pakistan follows his participation in the 200th-anniversary celebrations of the French Revolution and a one-day working visit to Moscow. During his talks with Benazir Bhutto, the two leaders primarily discussed bilateral relations between India and Pakistan and issues related to South Asia. After the talks, Benazir Bhutto hosted a banquet in honor of Rajiv Gandhi. Pakistani President Ghulam Ishaq Khan also met with Rajiv Gandhi.

This meeting between Rajiv Gandhi and Benazir Bhutto is the second significant encounter between the two leaders since the end of last year, when they met at the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit in Islamabad. Following that summit, India and Pakistan signed three agreements: the "Agreement on Non-Attack on Each Other's Nuclear Installations," the "Avoidance of Double Taxation on Trade Between the Two Countries," and the "Enhancement of Cultural Exchanges Between the Two Countries."
