Recently, a sulfuric acid plant was built in the densely populated area of Yueyang River in our township. The surrounding areas have been severely polluted. The harmful gases emitted by the plant cause headaches for the residents. A primary school less than 100 meters away from the plant cannot conduct classes normally. The factory's wastewater has caused the fish and shrimp in the Yueyang River to disappear. This plant is only a few kilometers away from the Yellow River, and the polluted water flows into the Yellow River, causing concern for its pollution. We hope that the environmental protection department will dispatch personnel to investigate and handle the pollution issue of this plant.

    大峪沟硫酸厂污染周围地区
    最近，我乡在岳杨河人口稠密地区建了一个硫酸厂，周围地区受到严重污染。这个厂排放的有害气体，使人们感到头疼，离厂不足百米的小学不能正常上课。工厂排放的废水使岳杨河里的鱼虾绝迹。这个厂离黄河只有几公里，排放的污水流入黄河，使黄河也受到污染，后果令人担忧。希望环保部门快来人调查处理这个厂的污染问题。
