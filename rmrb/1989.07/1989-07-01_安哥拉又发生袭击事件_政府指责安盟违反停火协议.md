New China News Agency, Luanda, June 30th.

According to a report by the Angolan National News Agency today, an Angolan government official stated on June 29th that members of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) sabotaged the high-voltage power lines supplying electricity to the capital, causing several days of power outages in Luanda this week. This action seriously violated the ceasefire agreement reached between the government and UNITA on June 24th.

The government official pointed out that the sabotage occurred about 6 kilometers east of Kalomboloka in the neighboring province of Bengo. On June 27th, UNITA members also ambushed three vehicles on a road in the province of Bie, injuring 10 civilians. UNITA simultaneously destroyed one vehicle and damaged a high-voltage tower.

The Angolan government official emphasized that these ceasefire violations occurred while government and UNITA representatives were discussing a peace plan in Kinshasa.

The government official stated that the Angolan people should thwart the enemies of peace and do their utmost to adhere to the ceasefire agreement.
