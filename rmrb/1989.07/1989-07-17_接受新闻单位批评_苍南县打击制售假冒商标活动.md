The criticism from news organizations regarding the counterfeit trademark issue in Cangnan County, published on May 8 in the *People's Daily*, *Market News*, and broadcast by the Central People's Radio, caused a significant stir in Cangnan County. The Cangnan County Committee and the County People's Government regarded the criticism from the news organizations as well-intentioned. They resolved to redouble their efforts to rectify the situation and launched a special campaign to crack down on counterfeit and fraudulent activities.

First, a dedicated organization was established to strengthen leadership. The County Committee and the County People's Government formed a leading group to combat counterfeit and fraudulent activities, with the County Mayor as the head. The group included leaders from 11 functional departments, such as the public security, procuratorate, courts, procuratorate, and industry and commerce.

Second, legal measures were employed to thoroughly investigate and punish violations. The County People's Congress Standing Committee passed a resolution on "Further Implementing the Trademark Law and Resolutely Investigating and Punishing the Production and Sale of Counterfeit Trademarks." The County People's Government issued a notice on "Cracking Down on the Production and Sale of Counterfeit Trademarks," emphasizing the need to severely and swiftly punish counterfeit and fraudulent activities and to overcome the tendency to treat violations lightly with mere fines.

Third, a comprehensive approach was adopted. The County Committee and the County Government dispatched 216 government officials to form teams to combat counterfeit and fraudulent activities. These teams were sent to key areas to conduct propaganda, thoroughly investigate, and clean up and rectify the printing industry.

Fourth, the campaign to investigate and punish counterfeit and fraudulent activities was included in the performance evaluation system for officials.

To date, the county has dispatched 647 personnel to conduct surprise inspections of 901 enterprises and individual businesses. A total of 71 cases of violations have been uncovered, including 30 major cases. The inspections seized 1,030 meters of counterfeit clothing trademarks and 908,250 other trademark labels, as well as 195,000 bribery letters. Additionally, six cases, including the distribution of bribery letters by the Quanshan Science and Technology Factory to solicit orders for party member handbooks and the unauthorized printing of 1989 national college entrance examination political science prediction questions by the Jiangnan Craft Factory, were severely dealt with. Currently, the special campaign to combat counterfeit and fraudulent activities in Cangnan County is continuing to deepen.
