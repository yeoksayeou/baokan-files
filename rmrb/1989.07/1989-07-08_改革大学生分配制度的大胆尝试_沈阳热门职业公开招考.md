In Shenyang, many graduating university students who aspire to secure their ideal jobs no longer need to complain about not having connections. Shenyang City has begun to publicly recruit for some popular professions as a bold attempt to reform the university student allocation system.

On July 6th, the *Shenyang Daily* published a recruitment notice: 18 companies under the Shenyang Foreign Trade and Economic Commission plan to recruit 50 foreign trade business personnel, all of whom will be selected through examinations.

The recruitment notice fully discloses the recruitment conditions, number of positions, required specialties, and examination content to the public. The personnel department of the Foreign Trade and Economic Commission received more than 20 inquiries in just one morning, from eager university students and anxious parents.

Director Yang Jie of the personnel department of the Foreign Trade and Economic Commission said: "Last year, during student allocation, we received over 200 requests internally, which was truly a headache. This year, with public recruitment, we have been freed from the pile of requests and have truly gained the power to select talent."

Deputy Director Song Haisheng of the Shenyang Municipal Personnel Bureau said: "For the allocation of university graduates, the Foreign Trade and Economic Commission is just the first to implement public recruitment. The municipal government has decided that all government agencies will recruit graduating students through public examinations this year. This way, everyone will have the opportunity for equal competition, truly achieving the selection of the best from the best and making the most of everyone's talents."

    改革大学生分配制度的大胆尝试
    沈阳热门职业公开招考
    新华社沈阳7月8日电　（记者刘欣欣、张非非）在沈阳，许多想得到理想职业的应届大学毕业生不必再为自己没有后门而抱怨不公了。沈阳市今年开始对一些热门职业实行公开招考，作为改革大学生计划分配制度的一次大胆尝试。
    7月6日，《沈阳日报》刊登一则招考简章——沈阳市外经贸委所属18家公司拟招收的50名外贸业务人员，将全部通过考试择优录用。
    在简章中，招考条件、人数、专业和考试内容向社会全面公开。经贸委人事处一上午就接到20多个问询电话，有跃跃欲试的大学生，也有忧喜交织的学生家长。
    经贸委人事处处长杨杰说：去年学生分配时，我们内部就收到200多个条子，真是让人大伤脑筋。今年实行了公开招考，不仅使我们从条子堆里解脱出来，也让我们真正得到了选择人才的权力。
    沈阳市人事局宋海盛副局长说：“对分配大学生实行公开招聘，经贸委只是开个头，市政府决定所有机关今年录用应届毕业生都要实行公开招考。这样每个人都能得到平等竞争的机会，真正做到优中选优，人尽其才。”
