A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army is stationed in a county that is a national model for supporting the front. Recently, this unit was ordered to enter Beijing to carry out martial law. The women from six townships in the county, totaling over 670, organized themselves and, on July 8th, spent a day weeding 250 mu of farmland for the unit's farm. This action strengthened the military-civilian relationship and was praised by both the military and the civilians.

    解放军某部驻地是个全国支前模范县。不久前这个部队奉命进京执行戒严任务。驻地六个乡的670多名妇女组织起来，于7月8日用一天时间，为部队农场250亩农田锄草。密切了军民关系，受到军民称赞。
