On the eve of the "August 1" Army Day, more than 10 retired old generals and old experts from the National Defense Science and Technology Commission held a symposium with young scientific and technological personnel, young political work cadres, and soldier representatives. They used the glorious course of the national defense science and technology industry over the past 30-plus years to educate the young generation about the glorious traditions of the Party and the army.

Among these retired old generals and old experts, some had long served as leaders of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, while others were old commanders and old political commissars of China's rocket test base, nuclear test base, and conventional weapons test base. In today's symposium, they spoke earnestly to the young comrades: Over the past 30-plus years, China's national defense science and technology industry has developed from nothing to something, from small to large, and from weak to strong, achieving remarkable achievements that have attracted worldwide attention. At the same time, based on inheriting and carrying forward the fine traditions and styles of the people's army, a revolutionary spirit and fine style with the characteristics of the national defense science and technology front have gradually formed. These are the spirit of self-reliance and hard work; the spirit of selfless struggle and silent dedication; the spirit of respecting science and seeking truth from facts; the spirit of considering the overall situation and cooperating harmoniously; the spirit of seriousness and meticulousness. These revolutionary spirits and fine styles have inspired the broad masses of scientific and technological personnel and test troops to work tirelessly for decades, making outstanding contributions to the development of national defense science and technology and the promotion of national defense modernization. Today, as we thoroughly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, thoroughly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and oppose bourgeois liberalization, we must never forget and discard the glorious traditions.

During the symposium, the young scientific and technological personnel, young political work cadres, and soldier representatives, in connection with the actual situation from the student movement to the turmoil and then to the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, expressed their determination to strengthen political learning and carry forward the glorious revolutionary traditions.
