Today morning, the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch held a talk with NPC and CPPCC members in Hong Kong. Deputy Director Zheng Hua reported on the recent speeches by Deng Xiaoping and other central leaders, and Director Xu Jiatun spoke on Hong Kong issues.

In his speech titled "Unity and Effort to Stabilize Hong Kong," Xu Jiatun said, "Regarding the recent events in Beijing, if friends still have some different views, with the passage of time, everyone will understand the truth more, and the gap in understanding will narrow, and the common points will increase."

Xu Jiatun said, "The recent events in Beijing have gone through a process of gradual evolution. The vast majority of Hong Kong compatriots, out of concern for national affairs, support for the reform and opening-up policy, and attention to anti-corruption, clean governance, and democratic legal construction, have expressed their views. Their intentions are good. Due to not understanding or not fully understanding the true situation, some misunderstandings and actions have arisen, which are understandable. The Party and the government will not dwell on this. Hong Kong compatriots are members of the national family. In the future, they can still, as usual, go to the mainland to visit relatives, travel, do business, and engage in various exchanges. As long as they abide by the laws of the mainland, there will be no trouble. This is our attitude towards Hong Kong compatriots, and it is the same for the staff of our institutions and enterprises in Hong Kong. Staff who have participated in marches and signatures due to temporary misunderstanding will not be pursued by the leadership. Of course, during this event, some people in Hong Kong have done things in the mainland that violate national laws, which is not allowed in the mainland. In fact, causing chaos in the mainland is not only detrimental to the modernization of the motherland but will ultimately harm the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, which is harmful and not beneficial to Hong Kong compatriots."

When talking about the "One Country, Two Systems" issue, Xu Jiatun pointed out that the Chinese leadership has solemnly declared that the series of policies formulated by the Chinese government according to the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" regarding the Hong Kong issue will not change. After "1997," the mainland will adhere to the socialist system, while Hong Kong will retain the capitalist system, which will remain unchanged for at least fifty years. This is the need for China's socialist modernization cause and the need for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. He said, "One Country, Two Systems" is a national policy formulated by the Chinese government and confirmed by the solemn international agreement of the "Sino-British Joint Declaration." The Chinese government will not change Hong Kong's capitalist system and will not change "Two Systems" into "One System"; similarly, some people in Hong Kong should not attempt to use today's capitalist system in Hong Kong to change the socialist system in the mainland and turn the future of the mainland into capitalism. The reform in the mainland is the self-improvement of the socialist system, not the negation of the socialist system itself. Whether during the transitional period or after "1997," people from the mainland coming to Hong Kong should respect Hong Kong's social system and laws; similarly, people from Hong Kong going to the mainland should also respect the social system and laws of the mainland and should not engage in activities that violate the laws of the mainland. Opposing the relationship between Hong Kong and the mainland will inevitably harm the overall interests of the Chinese nation and will inevitably harm the interests of Hong Kong compatriots, which should be avoided.

Xu Jiatun said that the most urgent task at present is to work hard to stabilize Hong Kong. Although we have different views on some issues, we have a fundamental common point, that is, everyone loves the motherland and loves Hong Kong, and everyone hopes that Hong Kong can be prosperous and stable for a long time. With the policy of "One Country, Two Systems" and the "Sino-British Joint Declaration," and by doing a good job in drafting the "Basic Law," we have the political foundation for the great unity of Hong Kong compatriots and the people of the motherland, and an important guarantee for maintaining Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability. It is worth noting that recently some people have proposed some views that are not in line with the spirit of the "Sino-British Joint Declaration," which is not feasible and is not conducive to stabilizing Hong Kong and enhancing the confidence of Hong Kong people.

Xu Jiatun further pointed out that the most fundamental thing to stabilize Hong Kong is to stabilize Hong Kong's economy. Over the past few decades, especially since the signing of the "Sino-British Joint Declaration," Hong Kong's economy has maintained continuous growth and achieved remarkable results. These achievements have improved Hong Kong's status, won the admiration of the world, and also won the respect of the people of the motherland. Today, the difficulties faced by Hong Kong's economy are temporary, while the objective factors that guarantee Hong Kong's economy to continue to prosper and stabilize in the future will be long-term. We are still full of confidence in Hong Kong's future.

Under the current circumstances, Xu Jiatun believes that more than ever, we need to think calmly and rationally, to see the temporary factors and long-term factors, to see the secondary factors and the leading factors, to be self-reliant and confident, to strive forward, to unite and work together to stabilize Hong Kong. The future of Hong Kong, first of all, depends on the efforts of the Hong Kong people themselves, depends on the Hong Kong people fully recognizing the status and value of Hong Kong, fully utilizing the advantages of Hong Kong, seeking long-term stability of society, and seeking continuous prosperity of the economy.

    新华社香港分社与在港人大代表政协委员座谈
    许家屯就香港问题发表讲话
    强调齐心协力稳定香港
    新华社香港7月8日电  今天上午，新华社香港分社召开了在港的全国和各省、市、区人大代表、政协委员座谈会。副社长郑华通报了邓小平等中央领导人最近的几次讲话精神，社长许家屯就香港问题发表了讲话。
    在题为《齐心合力，稳定香港》的讲话中，许家屯说，对这次北京事件，如果朋友们还有一些不同的看法，随着时间的推移，大家对事情的真相会了解得更多，相信在认识上的距离会缩小，共同点会越来越多。
    许家屯说，这次北京事件，有一个逐步演变的过程。绝大多数香港同胞，出于对国事的关心，对改革开放政策的支持，对肃贪廉政、民主法制建设的关注，表示自己的见解，本意是好的。由于不了解或者不完全了解真实情况，产生某些误会和行动，是可以理解的。对此，党和政府是不会计较的。香港同胞是祖国大家庭的成员，今后仍可以像往常一样，到内地去探亲、旅游、做生意和进行各种交流活动。只要遵守内地的法律，不会有麻烦。我们对香港同胞是如此，对我驻港机构和中资企业的职工也是这样。由于一时不明真相而参加过游行、签名等活动的职工，领导上不予追究。当然，在这次事件中，香港某些人到内地去做了一些有违国家法律的事，这在内地是不能容许的。其实，搞乱了内地，不仅不利于祖国的现代化建设，而且最终必然会损害香港的繁荣和稳定，对香港同胞是有害无利的。
    讲到“一国两制”问题时，许家屯指出，我国领导人已经郑重声明，中国政府按照“一国两制”的构想所制定的关于香港问题的一系列方针政策是不会改变的。在“九七”以后，内地坚持社会主义制度，香港保留资本主义制度，至少五十年不变，这是我国社会主义现代化建设事业的需要，也是香港长期繁荣和稳定的需要。他说，“一国两制”是中国政府制定的国策，并经过《中英联合声明》这一庄严的国际协议予以确认。中国政府决不会改变香港的资本主义制度，决不会把“两制”改成“一制”；同样香港的某些人也不要想用今天香港的资本主义制度去改变内地的社会主义制度，把内地的明天变成资本主义。内地的改革，是社会主义制度的自我完善，而不是否定社会主义制度本身。不论是过渡期内还是“九七”以后，内地人到香港来，要尊重香港的社会制度与法律；同样，香港人到内地去，也要尊重内地的社会制度和法律，不要进行有违内地法律的活动。把香港与内地的相互关系对立起来，其结果必然会使中华民族的整体利益受到损害，也必然会使香港同胞的利益受到损害，这是应当努力避免的。
    许家屯说，当前最紧迫的工作，是要为稳定香港而努力。尽管我们对一些问题有这样那样的不同看法，但我们有一个根本的共同点，就是大家都爱祖国，爱香港，大家都希望香港能够长期繁荣和稳定。有了“一国两制”的方针，有了《中英联合声明》，再把制订《基本法》的工作做好，我们就有了实现香港同胞和祖国人民大团结的政治基础，就有了维护香港长期繁荣稳定的重要保证。值得注意的是，最近有人提出了一些与《中英联合声明》精神不符的主张，这是行不通的，也是不利于稳定香港和增强港人信心的。
    许家屯进一步指出，稳定香港，最根本的是稳定香港的经济。几十年来，尤其是《中英联合声明》签署以来，香港经济持续增长，取得了骄人的成就。这些成就，提高了香港的地位，赢得了世人的赞誉，也赢得了祖国人民的尊重。今天香港经济遇到的困难是暂时的，而保证今后香港经济持续繁荣稳定的客观因素将是长期起作用的。我们对香港的前途依然充满信心。
    在目前的境况下，许家屯认为，比以往任何时候更需要冷静地理性地思考，看清暂时因素与长远因素，看清次要因素与主导因素，自强自信，奋发进取，齐心合力，稳定香港。香港的未来，首先取决于港人自身的努力，取决于港人充分认识香港的地位和价值，充分发挥香港的优势，谋求社会的长期稳定，谋求经济的持续繁荣。
