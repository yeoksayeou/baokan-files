Hainan Special Economic Zone Focuses on Infrastructure Development
Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, and Communications See Significant Progress

According to Xinhua News Agency, Haikou, July 13th (Reporter Chen Jiang) The Hainan Special Economic Zone, despite facing national financial constraints, material shortages, and difficulties in securing funds, has been diligently working on infrastructure development. This has led to the overall stable development of the special economic zone.

Hainan is a province that lacks grain and has to import approximately 300 million kilograms of grain from mainland China and abroad each year. The provincial party committee and government recognize that agriculture is the foundation of Hainan's development and construction. The grain issue is crucial to the stability and development speed of the special economic zone, and efforts must be made to address it. Last winter and this spring, over 2,600 officials from various cities and counties went to the countryside to strengthen spring agricultural production. In the first half of the year alone, 60 million yuan was invested in grain production, resulting in a bumper harvest of early rice. The total grain production reached 1.59 billion kilograms, second only to the historical high of 1.974 billion kilograms in summer grain production.

Another key aspect of Hainan's infrastructure development is the continued focus on energy, transportation, communications, and water supply projects. This year, Hainan has started or continued 18 major infrastructure and raw material production projects with a total investment of 3 billion yuan. The development of electricity, as a key focus, has yielded positive results. Building on the two 50,000-kilowatt generators that came online at the end of last year, two more 100,000-kilowatt generators were added in the first half of this year. This increased the province's total installed power capacity to 560,000 kilowatts, thereby promoting industrial production. In the first half of the year, the province's total industrial output value reached 1.09 billion yuan, an 18.4% increase over the same period last year. State-owned industrial enterprises under the budget completed an output value of 802 million yuan, a 58% increase over the same period last year. Product sales revenue reached 839 million yuan, a 74% increase over the same period last year, with a total profit of 90.87 million yuan, a 2.5-fold increase over the same period last year.

Due to the continuous improvement of the investment environment, Hainan's utilization of foreign capital continues to grow, and cooperation with the mainland economy is further strengthened. In the first half of this year, the total amount of foreign capital utilized continued to grow. By the end of June, 234 foreign-invested enterprises had been approved by the provincial economic cooperation department, with a total foreign exchange investment of 259 million US dollars. There were 800 mainland-invested enterprises, with a total investment of 460 million yuan. The infrastructure development of the Yangpu, Basuo, and Machuan development zones is actively underway.

    海南特区抓紧基础建设
    农业和能源交通通信等获长足发展
    据新华社海口7月13日电  （记者陈江）海南经济特区在国家收紧银根，资金困难，原材料供应不足的情况下，扎扎实实搞好基础建设工作，使特区经济获得全面稳步发展。
    海南是一个缺粮省份，每年都要从内地和国外购进3亿公斤左右的粮食。省委、省政府认识到，农业是海南开发建设的基础，粮食问题关系到特区的稳定和发展速度，必须下苦功夫经营。去冬今春，全省各市县共有2600多名干部下乡，加强春耕生产，仅上半年投入粮食生产的资金就达6000万元，从而取得早稻大丰收，粮食总产量达15.9亿斤，仅次于历史最高水平的1974年夏粮产量。
    海南加强基础建设的另一项重要内容是，继续抓好能源、交通、通信和供水工程的建设。今年，海南动工兴建和续建的基础设施和原材料生产重点工程项目18个，总投资30亿元。以发展电力为重点的能源建设，成绩可喜，在去年底新增两台共5万千瓦发电机组的基础上，今年上半年又增加了两台共10万千瓦的发电机组，使全省电力装机容量达到56万千瓦，由此促进了工业生产。全省上半年共完成工业总产值10.9亿元，比去年同期增长18.4％，其中预算内国营工业企业完成产值8.02亿元，比去年同期增长58％，产品销售收入8.39亿元，比去年同期增长74％，实现利润总额9087万元，比去年同期增长2.5倍。
    由于投资环境不断改善，海南利用外资继续增长，与内地经济联营协作进一步增强。今年上半年利用外资总数继续增长，到6月底，经省经济合作厅审批的外商投资企业有234家，项目外汇投资2.59亿美元，内地投资企业800家，项目投资额为4.6亿元人民币。洋浦、八所、马村等开发区的基础建设正积极进行。
