Castro Denounces U.S. Anti-Cuba Actions

HAVANA, July 12 (Xinhua) — Cuban Council of State Chairman Fidel Castro recently strongly condemned the repeated incursions of U.S. military aircraft into Cuban airspace.

According to a report by Cuban radio this morning, Castro said at a meeting of the Cuban Council of State on July 9 that U.S. military aircraft would not be allowed to violate Cuban airspace and that intruding U.S. aircraft must be struck down.

At the July 9 meeting, Castro also criticized the U.S. government and media for defaming and slandering the Cuban government over the alleged involvement of several Cuban military officers in drug trafficking. He pointed out that since Washington had long been aware of the information regarding the involvement of several Cuban military officers in drug trafficking, it should have promptly informed the Cuban government. However, Washington did not do so but waited for the opportunity to use the drug trafficking incident to launch a campaign against and defame the Cuban government. Castro said that the Cuban government began investigating the drug trafficking incident based on information provided by Colombians.

On July 7, 14 military officers, including former Cuban Army Commander in Angola General Ochoa, were sentenced to death or imprisonment by a Cuban special military court for involvement in drug trafficking.

Castro also revealed that Cuban intelligence agencies had informed the Washington authorities of a plot to assassinate former U.S. President Reagan.

    卡斯特罗发表讲话谴责美国反古行径
    新华社哈瓦那7月12日电  古巴国务委员会主席卡斯特罗近日强烈谴责美国军用飞机不断侵犯古巴领空的行径。
    据古巴电台今晨报道，卡斯特罗在9日举行的古巴国务委员会会议上指出，决不允许美军飞机侵犯古巴的领空，对入侵的美军飞机必须予以打击。
    在9日的会议上，卡斯特罗主席还抨击了美国政府和舆论就数名古巴军官参与贩毒一事对古巴政府进行诽谤和造谣中伤的行径。他指出，既然华盛顿早就掌握了有关数名古巴军官参与贩毒的情报，它应该及时向古巴政府通报。但华盛顿并没有这样做，而是等待时机，利用贩毒事件掀起一场反对和中伤古巴政府的运动。卡斯特罗说，古巴政府是根据哥伦比亚人提供的线索，开始对贩毒事件进行调查的。
    7月7日，前古巴驻安哥拉陆军司令奥乔亚中将为首的14名军官因参与贩毒，被古巴特别军事法庭判处死刑或有期徒刑。
    卡斯特罗还透露，古巴情报机构曾向华盛顿当局通报过一起有人企图暗杀美前总统里根的阴谋。
