The book "The True Face of Fang Lizhi," edited by the Office of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, has recently been published by the Law Press. It is reported that the book compiles Fang Lizhi's reactionary speeches opposing the Four Cardinal Principles and advocating bourgeois liberalization, as well as articles from newspapers and magazines that discuss Fang Lizhi's incitement, planning, and organization of turmoil and riots. Relevant authorities believe that this book is of great reference value in enhancing the understanding of the essence of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in the capital, and in exposing the ugly faces of a few instigators, planners, and organizers.
