Oil Spill Severely Pollutes Beach; U.S. Uses Microorganisms to Aid Cleanup

	WASHINGTON, July 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal environmental officials said on July 7 that recent efforts to use "oil-eating" microorganisms to clean up oil-polluted beaches have shown promising initial results, making it possible to use biological treatment methods to clean up some of the beaches polluted by the oil spill from the Exxon Valdez.

	The Exxon Valdez, a large oil tanker owned by the U.S. Exxon Oil Company, ran aground in Prince William Sound, Alaska, on March 24, spilling a large amount of crude oil that polluted a vast area of the bay and beaches. Cleanup work has been ongoing. Scientists, in an effort to cultivate oil-eating microorganisms, used special nutrients on a rocky beach covered with oil. A few days later, the surface of the experimental site was noticeably cleaner than other areas. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator William K. Reilly said this is potentially good news for the bay and could be used on a larger scale.

	Since the oil spill, the cleanup of the beaches has been very labor-intensive. Workers have used high-pressure hoses, steam to wash the beaches, and even scrubbed rocks by hand. If the biological method can be adopted, it will save money and labor and be more effective. Exxon Oil Company has already spent $3.1 million on biological experiments. If the experiments are further successful, then manual cleanup can be concentrated on the 80-kilometer stretch of beach most severely polluted.

    石油泄漏严重污染海滩  美国借微生物帮助清理
    本报华盛顿7月8日电　据美国联邦环保官员7月7日称，近期有关方面利用“食油”微生物清理油污海滩，试验取得可喜的初步效果，因而有可能以生物处理方式清理一部分被“瓦尔德兹”号油轮漏油污染的海滩。
    美国埃克森石油公司所属的大型油轮“瓦尔德兹”号是今年3月24日在阿拉斯加州威廉太子湾触礁的，大量泄漏的原油污染了大面积的海湾海面和海滩，清理工作一直在进行。据称，科学家为培育食油微生物，曾在一片油污卵石海滩上使用了特别的培养剂，几天后，试验场所的表层明显比其他地方干净。环保局长赖利说，这对海湾是个潜在的好消息，可能在大范围加以使用。
    自从漏油事件以来，海滩的清理工作十分费力，工人使用高压水龙、蒸汽冲洗海滩，甚至用双手刷洗岩石。如果生物方法能以采用，则可省钱省力，也更有效。埃克森石油公司为进行生物试验，已经支出310万美元，如试验进一步成功，那么人工清理可以集中在污染最严重的80公里长的海滩上。
