On June 7th, a female student from Jiajiang Middle School, Zhou Yunxia, was riding her bicycle through the Shifan Dike at the Guniu Stone area. Due to the narrow road, she fell into a three-meter-deep dike and drowned, becoming the 36th victim of this dike since its construction 21 years ago.

Originally, there was a 4.5-meter-wide road next to the Shifan Dike. In 1958, when the dike was being built, some people destroyed over 5,000 meters of this road, turning the once smooth and safe road into a narrow and dangerous path along the dike. Many people have to take risks to pass through. According to an investigation, from the Wuma Bridge to the Qianfo Rock Ferry, there are 12 dangerous sections on this road, which is heavily trafficked. If one is not careful, there is a risk of falling into the dike.

    宽阔公路人为变窄  伤亡不断无人过问
    六月七日，我县夹江中学女生周云霞，骑车途经石面堰的牯牛石处时，由于道路狭窄，摔入三米深的堰中，溺水身亡，成为这条堰建成二十一年来的第三十六位殉难者。
    石面堰旁原有一条四米半宽的公路，一九五八年修堰时，有些人将这条公路毁坏五千多米，使平坦安全的公路变成了又窄又险的堰边小道，不少人只好冒险通行。据调查，石面堰五马桥至千佛岩渡口这段路，有险段十二处，行人最多，稍不注意，就有掉入堰内的危险。
