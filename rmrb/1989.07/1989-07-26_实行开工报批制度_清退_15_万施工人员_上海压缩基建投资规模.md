Shanghai 26th July, Reporter Xiao Guan Gen reports: To reduce the high investment scale, the Shanghai Municipal Government announced two measures yesterday: All new construction projects must be approved by the "Shanghai Construction Project Start-Up Approval Group" jointly formed by the Municipal Planning Commission and the Municipal Construction Commission before they can commence; and to rectify the construction market, 150,000 excess construction workers will be dismissed this year.

At the beginning of this year, Shanghai had taken various measures to reduce the investment scale and rectify the construction market, dismissing construction teams, but these efforts did not achieve the expected results. From January to June, the total fixed asset investment in the city increased by 21.4% compared to the same period last year. The 20,000 outsourced workers that local construction enterprises in Shanghai dismissed before the Spring Festival returned, and most of the construction teams whose permits were revoked remained in Shanghai.

To reduce the investment scale, it is necessary to "address both issues simultaneously," stopping and delaying projects while resolutely dismissing construction teams. To this end, Shanghai plans to take the following measures:

	—Strictly enforce bidding and contract management. Projects that do not comply with bidding regulations, even if they have already started construction, will be immediately stopped, and banks will suspend payments, pending processing by the Municipal Bidding Office. Projects that have gone through bidding and signed contracts but have not started construction will also need to go through the start-up approval process before they can commence.

	—To control the influx of outsiders into Shanghai's construction market, except for municipal, district, and county-affiliated construction enterprises, and central government enterprises in Shanghai, only city construction, municipal key projects, real projects, and "three-in-one" projects are allowed to use certified outsiders. Starting from September 1st, other ongoing projects will not be allowed to use outsiders.

	—By September 1st, all construction enterprises of ongoing projects in the city must submit their construction and installation investment indicators issued by the construction unit and the upper-level management bureau, and the bank account opening certificate issued by the construction unit's bank, to the Municipal Construction Engineering Management Bureau for verification of the project construction permit. Those who fail to submit the verification and continue construction will be investigated, and municipal enterprises will be disqualified from bidding for one year, while outsider enterprises will be dismissed.

	—Approved construction enterprises from other provinces and municipalities in Shanghai will immediately dismiss surplus personnel. Starting from September 1st, municipal, district, and county construction management departments will organize inspections. If discrepancies are found or surplus personnel are not dismissed, the enterprise's permit to enter Shanghai will be revoked.

	—Starting from September 1st, the Municipal Construction Bank will issue living expenses to outsider construction enterprises in Shanghai based on the approved number of personnel.

The Shanghai Municipal Government requires relevant departments to inspect all ongoing construction projects in the city according to their respective management scopes starting from September 1st and report the situation monthly.

### 实行开工报批制度　清退15万施工人员  上海压缩基建投资规模

    实行开工报批制度　清退15万施工人员
    上海压缩基建投资规模
    本报上海7月26日电　记者萧关根报道：为压缩居高不下的投资规模，上海市政府昨天宣布两项措施：所有新开工的单位工程均需报市计委、市建委联合组成的“上海市建设工程开工审批小组”批准后才能开工；整顿建筑市场，年内清退15万多余施工人员。
    今年初，上海市曾采取多种措施压缩投资规模和整顿建筑市场，清退施工队伍，但都未能达到预期目标。1至6月，全市固定资产投资完成额比去年同期增加21.4％，全市地方建筑企业在今年春节前清退的2万外地包工又回来了，已经吊销许可证的施工队伍大部分仍然留在上海。
    要压缩投资规模，一定要“双管齐下”，在停、缓建项目的同时，下决心清退施工队伍。为此，上海准备采取以下几个办法：
    ——严格招投标和合同管理，今年以来不符合招投标规定、即使已经施工的，也要立即停下来，银行中止付款，听候市招投标办公室处理。虽经招标并已签合同、但工程尚未开工的，也应在办理开工报批手续后才能开工。
    ——为控制上海建筑市场的外地劳力，凡市、区、县所属施工企业，及中央在沪施工企业，除城建、市重点、实事工程以及“三资”工程允许使用有证外地劳务人员外，自9月1日起，其它在建项目原则上不准使用外地劳力。
    ——9月1日前，全市所有在建施工项目的施工企业必须持建设单位、上级主管局出具的该项目建设安装投资指标及建设单位的开户银行出具的资金落实证明，向市建筑工程管理局交验项目施工许可证，逾期未交验而继续施工者一经查实，市内企业停止投标资格一年，外地企业清退。
    ——经核准在上海施工的外省市建筑企业，将超编人员立即清退。9月1日起，市、区、县建筑主管部门，将组织力量核查，发现与自报不符或超编人员未清退的，即吊销该企业进沪许可证。
    ——自9月1日起，市建设银行将按核定人数向外地在沪施工企业，发放生活费用。
    上海市政府要求市各有关部门按照各自所管理的范围，从9月1日起按上述规定对全市在建施工项目进行检查，每月汇报情况。
