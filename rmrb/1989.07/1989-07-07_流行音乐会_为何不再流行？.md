Once popular pop music concerts, which primarily feature pop songs, have now become unpopular in the cities and countryside of northern Jiangsu. In the first three months of this year, the average attendance rate for pop music concerts held at our theater was only 40.5%, a decrease of 25.8% compared to last year.

What are the reasons for this?

Firstly, the performing troupes are often hastily assembled, and the performers' skills are not high. From the performances at our theater, less than 1/4 are formal song and dance troupes. Some, although formal troupes, often send small teams to represent the entire troupe, resulting in weak performance capabilities and an inability to present exquisite artworks. The composition of other non-formal troupes is even more complex. Some are "reassigned troupes." Members of professional troupes originally engaged in opera, acrobatics, and folk arts have all rushed into the wave of pop music concerts. Some are "itinerant troupes," relying on one or two singers with some fame or movie stars to temporarily form a troupe. Others are composed of individuals with some singing talent. Since the members of these troupes come from all directions, the quality of their performances is difficult to guarantee. Many troupes have very rudimentary performance equipment. Some troupes have only four or five musicians, some rely on renting instruments and equipment to maintain performances, and others use recorded music. These troupes often charge high ticket prices and move from place to place, performing for a day or two in one location, making some money, and then moving on.

Secondly, the content is repetitive, and the forms are monotonous and similar. From the performance content, more than 70% of the programs are the same among the troupes, with songs like "Yellow Earth Plateau" and "Nothing to My Name" almost becoming mandatory performances for every troupe. The performance styles of the troupes are also quite similar, lacking innovation.

Thirdly, the stage presence is not serious, and the performances are not taken seriously. Some make inappropriate jokes with the audience, damaging the stage atmosphere.

The audience for pop music concerts is mostly young people, and young people have a strong desire for novelty and innovation. When the frequency of pop music concerts is too high, it inevitably makes the audience "sick of it." Additionally, new entertainment venues like dance halls are gradually emerging in the cities and countryside of northern Jiangsu, providing them with new entertainment options, and the interest of some young people has shifted from theaters to dance halls.

In summary, the reasons why pop music concerts are no longer popular are due to both performance and appreciation factors, but the problems with the performance entities are the main reasons.

    “流行音乐会”为何不再流行？
    江苏东台市人民剧场　范宁生　郑静波
    曾经风靡一时，以流行歌曲为主体的音乐会，如今在苏北城乡已流行不起来了。我剧场今年1至3月，举办的“流行音乐会”，平均上座率只有40.5％，比去年的平均上座率下降25.8％。
    这是什么原因呢？
    首先，剧团是拼凑的，演员水平不高。从在我剧场演出的情况看，正式的歌舞团体不足1／4。有的虽然是正式剧团，但往往以小分队充大剧团，演出力量薄弱，难以表现精湛的艺术作品。其他的非正式剧团成分更为复杂，有的是“改嫁”班子。一些原来从事戏曲、杂技、曲艺的专业剧团的人员，纷纷卷入“流行音乐会”的大潮之中。有的是“走穴班子”，凭借一两个有一定知名度的歌唱演员或电影明星，临时搭班，有的则是由一些略有演唱特长的人员组成。由于这些剧团的成员来自四方，因此，演出的质量难以保证。不少剧团的演出设备非常简陋。有的剧团乐队只有四五人，有的乐队靠租乐器、设备维持演出，还有的乐队靠放录音。这些剧团往往是票价昂贵，而且打一枪换一个地方，在一个地方演一两天，赚上一笔钱立即转移。
    其次，内容千篇一律，形式单调雷同。从演出的节目内容看，剧团之间有70％以上的节目是相同的，“黄土高坡”、“一无所有”等歌曲，几乎成了每个剧团的必演节目。各剧团的表现方式也基本上相似，缺少新意。
    再次，台风不够严肃，演出极不认真。有的与观众开一些不太文明的玩笑，败坏台风。
    “流行音乐会”的观众多为青年，而青年又有强烈求异、求新的意识。当“流行音乐会”举办频率过高之后，必然会令观众“倒胃口”。此外，舞厅等新的娱乐阵地在苏北城乡逐渐兴起，也为他们提供了新的娱乐天地，部分青年人的兴趣从剧场转向舞厅。
    总之，“流行音乐会”不再流行的原因，是由演出和欣赏两个因素构成，但演出主体存在的问题，乃是主要原因。
