The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Politburo announced with deep sorrow to the entire party and the nation that Comrade János Kádár, who had served as the top leader of Hungary for over 30 years, passed away due to illness this morning. He was 77 years old.

Kádár was born in 1912. After the events of October 1956, he served as the First Secretary of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, leading Hungary back to a path of stability and development. For the next 33 years, he remained the principal leader of Hungary. In May 1988, the National Party Congress removed Kádár from his position as General Secretary and elected him as the Chairman of the Party. This year in May, the Central Committee of the Hungarian Party, citing health reasons, also removed him from his positions as Chairman of the Party and member of the Central Committee.

The joint obituary issued by the Hungarian Party Central Committee, the National Assembly, the Presidential Council, and the Council of Ministers highly praised Kádár's life.

Comrade Kádár attached great importance to developing friendly relations and cooperation between the two parties, two countries, and the peoples of China and Hungary. He had visited China multiple times, with his last visit occurring in 1987.
