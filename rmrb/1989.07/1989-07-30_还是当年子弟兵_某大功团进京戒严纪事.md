Still the Soldiers of Yesteryears
— A Record of a Model Regiment's Mission in Beijing

It is quite a coincidence that 50 years ago, this regiment was born in Haidian District, Beijing, and this time they were ordered to return to Haidian District to carry out martial law.

On the eve of August 1st, the first regiment commander Ji Tingxie, the first political commissar of the political department Wang Jianzhong, and the first platoon leader of the model fifth platoon Shi Jinqian returned to the old unit to visit the officers and soldiers. They vividly recounted the process of the regiment's establishment: After the Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, the Japanese invaders occupied Beijing. Facing national crisis, Ji Tingxie, Shi Jinqian, and others rallied more than 30 young patriots, using a few old guns to break into the Beijing Second Prison, rescuing more than 60 people including Jiao Ruogu, seizing more than 30 guns, establishing the Salvation Anti-Japanese Army, making military flags, promulgating regulations, and setting up a military-political committee. Later, they officially formed a regiment with part of the Red Army units.

Over the decades, this regiment has fought across the country to seize power. During the War of Liberation, it was awarded the title of Model Regiment, and it produced famous advanced units and individuals such as the "Model Platoon for Supporting the Government and Loving the People" and the "Model for Respecting Leaders, Loving Soldiers, and Loving the People" Lyu Shunbao.

The current regiment commander Cao Shuanze and political commissar Wang Yongcun truthfully reported to the old leaders about the regiment's performance in carrying out martial law, defending the interests of the republic and the people, and their deeds such as being besieged in the ancient city for three days, risking their lives to rescue an ammunition truck, and the "Three Loves." Ji Tingxie happily said, "Good, the spirit of our Model Regiment from back then is still here. Seeing you pass the test in the complex political storms, we are at ease." Shi Jinqian wrote: "Steel Wall of the People's Army, Glorious Deeds of Heroes."

After the Model Regiment entered Haidian District, they clearly stated: "Fifty years ago, the people of Haidian nurtured and protected our troops. Today, we must repay the people of Haidian with actual actions and let the people of Haidian be at ease." They not only maintained a formidable image of the troops day and night but also served the people with a civilized image. In a street where seven ethnic minorities reside, due to the failure of the sewer system, rainwater accumulated, making life extremely inconvenient for the residents. More than 100 soldiers of the Model Regiment crawled into the sewer, using basins to carry out 28 cubic meters of mud, bricks, and miscellaneous items, clearing 1,500 meters of sewer, and taking away all the garbage. The regiment's base had a fried dough stick stall that supplied breakfast for the residents. Political Commissar Wang discovered that some platoons also bought fried dough sticks here, affecting the residents' lives, so he made a "special regulation": Do not compete with residents for fried dough sticks. Platoons buying fried dough sticks here must make a reservation and send two soldiers who know how to fry dough sticks to serve voluntarily. To ensure the vegetable supply for residents, the Model Regiment sent cars to the suburbs every day to buy vegetables and actively helped the vegetable shops pull in vegetables; to ensure residents' normal rest, the entire regiment did not sing songs in the morning during physical training, regular classes, and after 10 PM; to ensure the normal working order of government agencies and factories, they did not chat or make phone calls in offices or workshops. To deepen understanding and foster feelings with the residents, they established seven propaganda teams to propagate the party's policies and guidelines. Political Commissar Wang also led the office staff to visit 10 residential committees, 16 factories, 7 government agencies, and 3 shops, introducing the combat history of the Model Regiment and sharing their experiences from studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

The actions and deeds of the Model Regiment deeply moved the residents. An old man with white hair and a cane came to the regiment and said, "When Ji Tingxie and others attacked the second prison, they held a meeting right on my kang. After you came to Haidian, I had an extra thought, to see if you were like the old troops. Now, I see clearly, it is still the style of the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, and this makes me at ease." Some residents, seeing that the soldiers could not watch TV, donated 7 TV sets; some, seeing that the troops had no newspapers, insisted on delivering two copies every day; some, seeing that the soldiers had to walk far to use the toilet, built a simple toilet nearby; some, seeing that the soldiers were standing in the scorching sun and intense heat on duty, sent 15 sun umbrellas. Some also helped to modify the faucets and arranged for the officers to take a bath once a week. In a month, 26 units and more than 300 individuals in Haidian District came to the regiment to do practical things and send warmth; the entire district also sent 47 letters of condolence and 6 banners. One banner read: "Still the Soldiers of Yesteryears, Still the Fish-Water Affection of Yesteryears."

    还是当年子弟兵
    ——某大功团进京戒严纪事
    范印华　刘鑫　陈万军
    说来真巧，50年前这个团诞生在北京海淀区，这次他们又奉命进驻海淀区执行戒严任务。
     八一前夕，第一任团长纪亭谢、第一任政治部主任王建忠、第一任特功五连指导员史进前回老部队看望指战员时，如数家珍地讲述了这个团诞生的过程：1937年芦沟桥事变后，日寇攻占北京。面对民族危亡，纪亭谢、史进前等人联络了30多名热血青年，靠几支老套筒打开北京第二监狱，营救了焦若愚等60多名人士，缴获了30多条枪，成立了救国抗日军，制作了军旗，颁布了纪律，建立了军政委员会，后来和部分红军连队正式建团。
    几十年来，这个团为夺取政权转战南北，在解放战争中荣获大功团称号，涌现出了“拥政爱民模范连”、“尊干爱兵爱民模范吕顺保”等全军闻名的先进单位和个人。
    现任团长曹栓泽、政委王永存如实地向老首长汇报了全团指战员执行戒严任务以来，为捍卫共和国和人民利益，在古城受围攻3天、冒死抢救弹药车以及“三热爱”等事迹。纪亭谢高兴地说：“好，有我们大功团当年那股劲儿。看到你们在复杂的政治风浪中经受住了考验，我们放心了。”史进前挥笔疾书：“钢铁长城子弟兵，英雄业绩光荣史”。
    大功团进驻海淀区以后，明确指出：“50年前海淀人民养育了我们部队，掩护了我们部队。今天我们要以实际行动回报海淀人民，让海淀人民放心。”他们不但以威武之师的形象昼夜执勤，还以文明之师的形象服务于民。有一条7个少数民族居住的街道，因下水道失修，下雨积水，居民生活极其不便。大功团的100多名官兵钻进下水道，用脸盆端上来28立方米污泥、砖瓦、杂物，将1500多米的下水道疏通，并把垃圾全部运走。大功团驻地有一个油条铺，供应居民早点。王政委发现一些连队也到这里购买油条，影响居民生活，便作出一项“特殊规定”：不准和居民抢购油条。连队到这里购买油条要预订，并要派出两名会炸油条的战士义务服务。为了保证居民的蔬菜供应，大功团每天派车到市郊购买，并且主动为菜店拉菜；为了保证居民正常休息，全团人员早晨出操、正课时间和晚上10点以后不唱歌；为了保证机关和厂矿企业的正常工作秩序，他们不到办公室、车间聊天、打电话。为了同居民加深理解，增进感情，他们成立了7个宣传小组，宣传党的方针政策。王政委还带着机关干部走访了10个居委会、16个工厂企业、7个党政机关和3家商店，向群众介绍大功团的战斗历程，交流学习党的十三届四中全会精神的心得体会。
    大功团的一言一行、一举一动，使居民们极为感动。一位白发苍苍的老大爷拄着拐棍到部队说：“当年纪亭谢他们打二监狱，就是在我的炕头开的会。你们到海淀以后，我还多了个心眼，看你们像不像那支老部队的样子。现在，我看清了，还是老红军、老八路的作风，这我就放心了。”有的居民见战士们看不上电视，主动送来7台电视机；有的人看到部队没有报纸，就坚持每天送两份；有的人见战士上厕所要跑很远的路，就主动在附近垒了简易厕所；有的人见战士顶烈日、冒酷暑执勤，就送来15顶太阳伞。有的人还帮助改装水龙头，安排官兵每周洗一次澡。一个月来，海淀区有26个单位和300多名个人到部队办实事、送温暖；全区还送来了47封慰问信和6面锦旗。有一面锦旗上写着：“还是当年子弟兵，还是当年鱼水情”。
