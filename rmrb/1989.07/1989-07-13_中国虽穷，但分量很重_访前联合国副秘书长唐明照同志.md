Editor's Note: The article "China, Though Poor, Carries Great Weight" published in the *China Youth Daily* offers valuable insights. Our newspaper is pleased to reprint it for our readers.

Beijing's crackdown on the counter-revolutionary rebellion has set Washington ablaze. Western calls for sanctions are rife. Carrying the doubts of ordinary Chinese people, the reporter braved the rain on the morning of July 4 to visit a quiet courtyard in Beijing, interviewing Tang Mingzhao, who had lived in the United States for over 30 years and served as the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General.

In U.S. Policy Toward China, American Interests Come First

At 79, Tang Mingzhao moved from Guangdong to San Francisco in 1920, where he completed his elementary and middle school education. In 1927, he returned to Tianjin to study at Nankai Middle School. After the September 18th Incident, he joined the Chinese Communist Party, interrupted his studies in the Department of Politics at Tsinghua University, and entered the Department of History at the University of California, Berkeley, to study modern Western history. After graduating, he worked as an English secretary for the Chinese Laundry Workers Union in New York. In 1940, he founded the famous *Chinese Daily News* in America and served as its first president. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he worked in the U.S. government. After the war, he returned to the *Chinese Daily News* as the editor-in-chief. During the Korean War, to avoid McCarthy's persecution, he secretly returned to his homeland. In 1971, he represented New China and returned to the other shore with unyielding spirit. In 1972, he was appointed as the United Nations Deputy Secretary-General in charge of political affairs, decolonization, and trust territories, serving for seven years. With half a lifetime spent in the United States, he is well-versed in the intricacies of American society.

"This past few months, I've been very anxious and very angry. This is not just because some people advocate 'complete Westernization' and American incitement, but also because I am concerned that many of our young people do not see through the conspiracy behind this internal and external pressure. From my observations, some people who have been to America do not truly understand America because they mainly go in and out of universities and government agencies. They may have some sense of the lifestyle and democratic enjoyment of the American middle and upper classes, but they do not understand the life of the American underclass, let alone the bitter history of racial discrimination we experienced under the Chinese Exclusion Act. America is a great country, but it is also the country with the most contradictions in the world. The *Declaration of Independence* talks about equality, but in reality, racial discrimination exists everywhere. Democracy and freedom are class-based. When dealing with the American government, if one forgets the duality and pragmatism of America, one will only be deceived.

"You all know Stanford University. In the past, Stanford boldly hired Chinese workers to build the American transcontinental railroad, but when the 'Black Friday' economic crisis hit, Stanford became an expert in anti-Chinese sentiment. During the Anti-Japanese War, General Stilwell, to quickly defeat Japan, advocated simultaneously aiding the armies of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, for which he was later removed from his post. During the War of Liberation, Truman bet on Chiang Kai-shek, resulting in the defeat of the Kuomintang. The Americans also suffered a defeat in the Korean War. Dulles and others thus believed that America had 'lost China.' This is indeed strange. China belongs to the Chinese people, not to America; if there was any loss, it was America's loss of its strategic interest in dominating the world. Military force could not suppress New China, so the then Secretary of State Dulles proposed the strategy of 'peaceful evolution,' blockading China for more than 20 years. When Nixon became president, the anti-communist Nixon came to Beijing to break the deadlock. This was to cope with the political, economic, and social crises at home caused by the Vietnam War (Nixon had declared a 'national state of emergency' twice), and also to compete with the Soviet Union. During his visit to China, he told Chairman Mao, 'I am here for the interests of America.' Chairman Mao praised Nixon for telling the truth. Carter established diplomatic relations with China, but Congress passed the *Taiwan Relations Act*, pragmatically seeking strategic interests. Now, does America's support for the student movement truly aim for China's democracy? In the end, the most fundamental goal of America's policy toward China is to always strive to control China. Fang Lizhi, using foreigners to gain importance, is indeed helping America. In October 1971, when the UN General Assembly discussed restoring China's lawful seat in the United Nations, the then American representative, now President Bush, was instructed to use every means to obstruct it. Friendship and enmity, heaven and earth, east and west of the river, are all facts, all for the interests of America."

Tang's recounting of a history of Sino-American relations made one acutely aware of the tortuous path and harsh realities of his half-life dedicated to Sino-American exchanges.

"Does the U.S. House of Representatives' unanimous vote against sanctions on China concern you?" the reporter asked.

"Fear what? As long as we recognize the basic purpose of America's policy toward China and are prepared, that's enough. Besides, we live on the same planet and cannot avoid interactions. We need technology, and they need the market. Using the market to exchange technology, we may suffer some losses temporarily, but ultimately, it will make China open up and become strong. In the past, America blockaded us for so long, but we developed the atomic bomb. The key is that we must be stable internally and not chaotic. We can resolve our own disputes. The sky won't fall, and no one can control us."

The West Will Not Abandon the Vast Chinese Market

When discussing some countries' criticisms of our suppression of the rebellion, Old Tang sipped his tea and analyzed, "Firstly, this is because they do not understand the true situation. Secondly, there is also the issue of pressure from America. I remember in the 1970s when I was working at the UN headquarters, I once joked with my foreign colleagues that the Secretary-General's skill is to burn incense in various temples. From its inception, the UN has been controlled by America due to its financial sources. Now, America's contribution to the UN budget has decreased to a quarter, and it is difficult for America to control the UN on the surface, but it can still use financial issues to pressure the UN into submission. For us, there is an 'ear problem'; we must be clear-headed about others' criticisms. Some countries criticize China and threaten to stop economic exchanges, which is interference in China's internal affairs. I believe that as China's situation stabilizes, foreign friends and countries that criticize us will eventually understand the truth and continue to trade with us. We only decide our internal and external policies based on our specific situation. As long as we insist on independence and self-reliance, we can seize the initiative. The question is whether we ourselves are up to the task."

Regarding the issue of foreign countries withdrawing funds, Old Tang put on his glasses, opened an English version of the *American Almanac*, and smiled, saying, "America's federal debt has now reached 2 trillion dollars, and the federal government has to borrow nearly 300 million dollars a day just to get by. Since Smith's *The Wealth of Nations*, except for Keynes proposing government intervention in the economy and increasing expenditure to maintain production, Western economists have not published a complete analysis of contemporary capitalism and proposed practical measures. Of course, socialist economics also face many new problems. Now, the biggest headache for Western countries is overproduction. Since the market is already full, it is difficult to make a profit by investing in factories, so they all want to engage in financial speculation. As long as we insist on independent and self-reliant reform and opening up, the vast market of 1.1 billion people will eventually bring them back to China."

There Is No One More Loving of Their Country Than the Chinese People

"In the end, we must first solve our internal issues," Old Tang said, drinking the medicine his wife brought him, and continued speaking.

He said, "I am the first 'millionaire' on the Chinese mainland. When I first went to work for the UN, my annual salary was over $40,000, and when I left, it was $87,000. Working for seven years, I only hired a Chinese driver and used the necessary money, and the surplus, I gave to the country 260,000 dollars. Why? Because the Communist Party serves the public and requires a spirit of dedication. In recent years, the people are dissatisfied mainly because corruption has emerged within the party and the government, and the spirit of hard work has been lost. Corruption must be eradicated. First, start with the princes and nobles, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, whoever it is, do not be lenient. In recent years, I have seen many things I dislike and have been upset. For example, high consumption is advocated in countries with overproduction, while we have insufficient production. Comparing wealth with them, can we compete? The streets are filled with Japanese cars, and the shops are full of Coca-Cola; the film *The Last Emperor* won an Oscar, mainly relying on violating regulations to shoot scenes in the Forbidden City to boost its reputation. After earning a few billion dollars, they only gave us a few million, and some people in the country were still pleased, falling into the trap. A nation without self-respect has no right to exist. From a young age, I knew about Yue Fei, Shi Kefa, and Wen Tianxiang. Today's youth should indeed study Chinese history well. From my life's experiences, although we have made many mistakes in the past 40 years, these 40 years are undoubtedly the 40 years that have changed China's history the most, the 40 years when the Chinese people held their heads high, and also the most stable 40 years in China's modern history.

Leaning back on the sofa, this weathered old man was still not finished. He added, "The most important thing at present is to strengthen national self-confidence and promote a spirit of hard work, be practical, do first and talk later, and avoid empty talk. Only by accomplishing a few real things can we invigorate the national spirit, and patriotism will be put into practice. 'In Asia, except for Japan, China has the strongest scientific and technological forces. This is our great achievement. I advise young friends to believe that although our China is poor, it carries great weight, and that is why others do not dare to underestimate us. As long as we seriously correct various mistakes, carry forward the excellent cultural traditions of the Chinese nation, respect ourselves, and work together, there is no difficulty we cannot overcome. We must have self-respect and self-esteem!'”

    中国虽穷，但分量很重
    ——访前联合国副秘书长唐明照同志
    姚铮
    本报编者按：《中国青年报》刊载的《中国虽穷，但分量很重》这篇报道中，唐明照同志的一番见解很好。本报特予转载，向广大读者推荐。
    北京镇压反革命暴乱，隔岸的华盛顿如同火上了自己的房，西方要制裁的舆论也沸沸扬扬。带着许多普通中国人的疑惑，7月4日上午，记者冒雨来到北京一所幽静的四合院，采访了曾在美国前后生活30多年、担任过联合国副秘书长的唐明照同志。
    在美对华政策中美国的利益高于一切
    今年79岁的唐明照同志，早在1920年即随家从广东迁居美国旧金山，在那里读完小学和初中。1927年回到天津就读于南开中学。“九·一八”后他加入中国共产党，此后中断了在清华大学政治系的学习，进入美国加州大学历史系研读西方近代史，毕业后在纽约社会的最底层当了华侨洗衣馆联合会英文干事。1940年创办了著名的美洲《华侨日报》，任第一任社长。太平洋战争爆发后，他在美政府中任职，战后又回到《华侨日报》任总编辑。朝鲜战争爆发后，为避免受麦卡锡迫害而秘密返回祖国。1971年，他代表新中国，正气凛然地重返彼岸。1972年又出任负责政治事务、非殖民化、托管地工作的联合国副秘书长，一干就是7年。积半生在美国的经历，他对美国社会的三教九流可谓了如指掌。
    “这几个月我很着急，也很生气。这倒不只是因为有人主张‘全盘西化’和美国的煽动，而是担心我们许多年轻人看不透这种内外压力背后的阴谋。据我观察，有些到过美国的人并不真正了解美国，因为他们到美国主要是出入一些大学和政府机构，对美国中上阶层的生活和享受的民主可能有些感受，但不了解美国社会底层生活，更谈不上了解像我们当年受排华法种族歧视度过的辛酸历史。美国是一个了不起的国家，但美国又是一个世界上矛盾最多的国家。《独立宣言》上讲人生而平等，实际上美国无处不存在种族歧视。民主和自由是有阶级性的。同美国政府打交道，谁要是忘记美国的这种矛盾的两面性及其实用主义，谁就只能上当受骗。
　　“你们都知道斯坦福大学。当年斯坦福靠大胆雇用华工修成美国大铁路，但‘黑色星期五’经济危机一来，斯坦福又变成排华专家。抗日战争，史迪威将军为尽快打败日本，主张同时援助国民党和共产党的军队，为此后来被撤了职。解放战争，杜鲁门把死宝押在了蒋介石身上，结果国民党被打败。朝鲜战场美国也吃了败仗。杜勒斯等人由此认为美国‘丢了中国’。这实在奇怪。中国是中国人的，不属于美国；要说丢，那就是美国失去了称霸世界的战略利益。武力无法扼杀新中国，当时任国务卿的杜氏乃提出‘和平演变’的战略，对中国封锁了20多年。到了尼克松当总统，一向反共的尼克松来北京打破僵局。那是为了应付由于越南战争导致国内出现的政治、经济、社会危机（尼克松曾罕见地两次宣布“全国处于紧急状态”），也为了与苏联争霸。他在访华时对毛主席说‘我是为美国的利益而来的’。毛主席称赞尼克松讲了句实话。卡特同中国建交，但国会又搞了个《与台湾关系法》，实用主义地谋取战略利益。现在美国支持学潮能是真为中国的民主么？说到底，美国对华政策的一个最根本目标，就是始终竭力控制中国。方励之挟洋人以自重，正是帮了美国的忙。1971年10月联大讨论恢复中国在联合国的合法席位，那时的美国代表、现任总统布什奉命费尽九牛二虎之力阻挠。友好和不友好，天上地下，河东河西，都是事实，都是为美国的利益。”
    唐老勾略的一部中美关系史，令人清醒地感受到他大半生从事中美交往的曲折轨迹和严酷事实。
    “美国众议院刚以零票反对通过制裁中国的决议，您对此担心吗？”记者问。
    “怕什么？只要认清美国对华政策的基本目的，做到心中有数就行了。除此之外，我们生活在一个地球上，不能不来往。我们需要技术，他们需要市场。用市场换技术，我们暂时吃点亏，但终究使中国走向开放，走向富强。过去美国封锁我们那么久，但我们搞出了原子弹。关键是我们内部要稳定，自己不能乱，有争论自己解决。天塌不下来，谁也别想控制我们。”
    西方不会放弃巨大的中国市场
    谈到一些国家对我们镇压暴乱的指责，唐老呷了一口茶，分析说：“首先，这是因为他们并不了解事情真相。其次也有一个受美国的压力问题。记得70年代我在联合国总部任职时，有一天我同当时的外国同事开玩笑说，秘书长的本事就是会八面玲珑地去各个庙烧香。联合国从创始起，就因财政来源而受到美国控制。现在美国支付的钱减少到联合国预算的四分之一，表面上已难控制联合国，但仍然可以用经费问题压联合国就范。对我们来说有个‘耳根子’问题，对别人的指责要头脑清醒。一些国家指责中国并威胁停止经济交往，这是对中国内政的干涉。我相信，随着中国局势的稳定，国外的朋友和指责我们的国家早晚会了解事情的真相并继续同我们进行贸易。我们只根据自己的具体情况决定内外政策。只要坚持独立自主，就能掌握主动权。问题在于我们自己争不争气。”
    针对外国要抽走资金一说，唐老带上花镜，翻开一本英文版《美国年鉴》，笑着说，美国现在的联邦债务达2万亿美元，联邦政府每天要借不到300亿美元就过不了关。自史密斯的《原富》一书后，除了凯恩斯提出政府干预经济和增加支出维持生产外，西方经济学家还没有出版过一本完整地分析当代资本主义并提出切合实际的措施的经济学著作。当然，社会主义经济学也面临许多新问题。现在西方国家的一个最头痛问题是生产过剩，由于市场早已占满，投资开工厂获利难，所以都想搞金融投机。只要我们坚持独立自主、自力更生地改革和开放，11亿人口的巨大市场，早晚会使他们回到中国来的。
    没有比中国人更爱自己的祖国
    “说来说去，还是得先把我们内部的事解决好。”唐老喝下夫人送来的中药，依旧侃侃而谈。
    他说，我是中国大陆第一个“万元户”。刚去联合国工作时年薪4万多美元，临走时年薪8.7万。任职7年，我除了雇一个华侨司机和需要用的钱外，多余的钱，交给国家26万多美元，为什么？因为共产党天下为公，要有献身精神。这几年老百姓之所以不满，主要就是因为党和政府内滋生出腐败现象，艰苦奋斗的精神丢了。清除腐败。首先要从公子王孙开始，像小平同志讲的，碰到谁就是谁，决不能手软。这几年好多事我看不惯，生闷气。例如高消费，那原是生产过剩的国家提倡的，而我们是生产不足。跟人家比阔，比得起吗？把民族自尊心全比没了。大街上到处是日本车，商店里摆满可口可乐；电影《末代皇帝》得了奥斯卡奖，主要靠的就是违反规定在故宫内拍景壮了声势。人家赚了几亿美元后只给我们几十万元，国内有人为此还美滋滋，不打自倒。一个没有自尊心的民族是没有权利生存的民族。我从小就知道岳飞、史可法、文天祥，现在的青年确实应当好好学习中国历史。积我一生坎坷经验，尽管建国40年我们犯了不少错误，但这40年无疑是改变中国历史最大的40年，是中国人扬眉吐气的40年，也是中国近代最稳定的40年。
    靠在沙发上，这位饱经风霜的老人意犹未尽。他补充说，当前最重要的是坚定民族自信心和发扬实干精神，讲究实际，干了再说，不好大喜功，只有做出几件实事，才能振奋起民族精神，爱国主义才落到实处。“在亚洲，除日本外，中国的科技力量最强，这是我们了不起的成就。我劝青年朋友们相信，我们中国虽然穷，但分量很重，正因此别人才不敢小视我们。只要我们认真纠正种种失误，发扬中华民族的优秀文化传统，自己看得起自己，上下戮力同心，就没有克服不了的困难。千万要自尊和自重啊！”　（原载7月13日《中国青年报》）
