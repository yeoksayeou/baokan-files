The newly constructed Green Snail Park on the Beidaihe coast has recently begun welcoming visitors.

The Green Snail Park is located on Xiaodongshan in the eastern part of the coast, surrounded by the sea on three sides. This is the best spot for viewing sunrises and the sea. The park's main attraction, the Green Snail Tower, is modeled after a sea snail. The tower is 21 meters high, with seven levels and a rotating elevator. Inside the park, there are more than ten large murals, a large wooden sculpture of the "Sea Snail Fairy," and another of the "Sea Clam Girl." Additionally, there is a large standing screen depicting the story of "Liu Yi Sends a Letter."
