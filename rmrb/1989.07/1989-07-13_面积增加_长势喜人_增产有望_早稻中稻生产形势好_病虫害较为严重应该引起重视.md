Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 13th. — According to recent information from the grain procurement and sales coordination meeting of 14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions in southern China, which concluded in Chengdu, the area planted with early and medium-season rice has increased this year, and the growth is vigorous, with prospects for increased production.

This year, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hainan, totaling 14 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, planted 288.81 million mu of early and medium-season rice, an increase of 26 million mu compared to last year. Currently, the growth of rice is generally better than last year. It is estimated that the total production of early and medium-season rice can reach 107.6 billion kilograms, an increase of 2.5% compared to last year.

The issue that needs attention at present is that rice pests and diseases are relatively severe in the rice-producing areas. The meeting called on all localities to strive to do a good job in pest control and disease prevention, and to strive for a bumper harvest of rice this year.

    面积增加　长势喜人　增产有望
    早稻中稻生产形势好
    病虫害较为严重应该引起重视
    新华社成都7月13日电　（通讯员张先介）据最近在成都结束的南方14个省、市、自治区粮食购销联系会议提供的消息，今年我国早稻中稻播种面积增加，长势喜人，增产有望。
    今年，江苏、安徽、上海、浙江、福建、江西、广东、广西、湖南、湖北、四川、云南、贵州、海南等14省、市、自治区共栽早稻中稻28881万亩，比去年增加260万亩。目前，水稻生长情况普遍好于去年，预计早稻和中稻总产量可达1076亿公斤，比去年增产2.5％。
    当前值得注意的问题是，水稻产区病虫害较为严重。会议要求各地要努力做好灭虫防病工作，力争夺取今年水稻丰收。
