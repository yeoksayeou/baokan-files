A group of writers, including Wang Shixing, Wang Zongren, Su Fangxue, and Ji Peng, are currently braving the scorching summer heat to visit and experience life in the martial law troops in the capital. They are preparing to create reportage literature that reflects the heroic deeds of the officers and soldiers in the martial law troops.

This creative activity by the military writers is organized by the People's Liberation Army Press. They plan to publish a collection of reportage literature about the heroic deeds of the martial law troops as quickly as possible.

Deputy Director of the General Political Department, Zhou Keyu, praised this as a good initiative. He said that publicizing the heroic deeds of the martial law troops through reportage literature is beneficial for better informing our cadres, soldiers, youth, and the masses about the truth of the events. It is also beneficial for further strengthening military-civilian relations, restoring the image of our party and army, and better understanding and implementing the important speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee.
