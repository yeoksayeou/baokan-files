The All-China Federation of Trade Unions' 11th Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee expanded meeting today passed a resolution on mobilizing workers nationwide to deeply carry out the "double increase and double saving" campaign. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

The historic and significant Party's 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session has marked the decisive victory in our country's struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion. In this serious political struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the state, the Chinese working class has undergone a severe test and demonstrated great strength. Our current task is to respond to the call of the Party's 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, to further stabilize the situation and develop the economy, to make new contributions, and to achieve a thorough victory in stopping the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The current economic situation is quite severe. Workers of all ethnic groups across the country must further mobilize, deeply carry out the "double increase and double saving" campaign, prevent economic decline, and ensure the continuous, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

We must earnestly study the spirit of the Party's 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, raise political awareness, unify thinking, and march in step. We must use practical actions to counter the various interferences, sabotage, and rude interventions by anti-communist and anti-socialist forces at home and abroad. We must firmly uphold the four cardinal principles, resolutely resist the bourgeois liberalization trend and various decadent thoughts, oppose corruption, and use the advanced thoughts and spirit of the working class to influence the entire society.

We must, with the high sense of social responsibility of the working class, adjust the industrial and product structures, strive to produce marketable and export-oriented products, continuously improve product quality, complete the plan with quality and quantity, ensure supply, serve the people, enhance national strength, and bring glory to the country!

We must carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and thrift of the Chinese working class, starting from each worker's own post, strive to accelerate the construction of basic industries such as energy, transportation, and raw materials, produce more daily necessities by all means, save electricity, oil, coal, water, and raw materials, save all possible materials and funds, increase state fiscal revenue, prosper the enterprise, and improve working and living conditions, creating and accumulating all possible wealth.

We must carry forward the spirit of self-reliance and self-strengthening of the Chinese working class, fully tap into our wisdom, overcome various difficulties, and withstand various pressures. We must strive to improve the digestion and absorption capacity of introduced projects, better play the role of introduced projects, continuously improve the degree of localization, and diligently learn and master advanced world science and technology and management experience. We must further strengthen international economic and technological cooperation and exchanges, and strive for greater development in opening up to the outside world.

We must carry forward the spirit of dedication and creativity of the Chinese working class, and on a larger scale and in a solid manner, carry out various forms of mass technological innovation activities such as invention, technological cooperation, technological innovation, technological training, and rationalization suggestions. We must use our wisdom and strength to create new technologies, new processes, new methods, and new experiences, solve key production problems, and achieve the requirements of the "double increase and double saving."

We must carry forward the spirit of the working class as the master of the enterprise, strengthen scientific and democratic management of the enterprise, and seek benefits from management. Each worker must strictly observe labor discipline, uphold professional ethics, and maintain normal production and work order. We must actively participate in the democratic management of the enterprise, offer suggestions in enterprise decision-making, be the master, and especially play a greater role in revitalizing state-owned large and medium-sized key enterprises. Each enterprise should establish a fair and reasonable distribution system, improve the enterprise management mechanism, promote the deepening of enterprise reform, cultivate distinctive enterprise spirits, and build a good enterprise community of interests.

All levels of trade unions must earnestly publicize the spirit of the Party's 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, conduct education on the Party's basic line and the spirit of the working class as the master of the enterprise, so that the "double increase and double saving" campaign has strong ideological impetus. We must fully reflect the will and demands of the masses, actively cooperate with the government and enterprise administrations, formulate targets and measures for the "double increase and double saving," organize workers to carry out various forms of labor competitions, work solidly, and seek real results. In punishing corruption, solving social inequities in distribution, and strengthening price supervision, we must better play the role of trade unions in democratic participation and social supervision. We must care about the sufferings of the people, assist the government and administration in actively solving various difficulties in workers' labor and life, and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of workers. We must especially pay attention to production safety, strengthen labor protection, do a good job in safety supervision, and mobilize and protect the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers.

Workers of all ethnic groups across the country must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, actively respond to the call of the Party's 13th Central Committee's Fourth Plenary Session, take economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state, and walk the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country. With outstanding achievements, we will welcome the convening of the National Labor Model and Advanced Worker Commendation Conference and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation. We will strive to complete and overfulfill the national economic and social development plan for this year, and work hard for the cause of socialist modernization in our country!
