A certain army corps stationed in Heilongjiang Province in northern China has, over the years, adhered to the Party's literary and artistic policies, inherited and carried forward the fine traditions of the military's mass cultural work, and actively cultivated new literary talents, promoting amateur creation. It has become an advanced unit in cultural work within the Shenyang Military Region.

This army corps has a glorious historical tradition, being the successor to the New Fourth Army's Third Column. In those days, the commander organized the publication of the "Battlefield News" to enliven the cultural activities within the troops. Over the decades, although personnel have changed repeatedly, the various levels of party committees and leaders have consistently regarded the promotion of mass cultural activities as an indispensable important aspect of strengthening the construction of the troops.

In recent years, they have, through various forms, striven to discover and cultivate new literary talents, further promoting amateur creation. They have adopted the approach of "inviting in" and "going out" for short-term training, periodically holding amateur creation cadre guidance classes, inviting writers and literary editors from within and outside the military to give lectures and revise works. For those with certain writing abilities and development prospects, they are sent to academies or newspaper and magazine editorial departments for training, establishing a cadre team with a certain level of creation. Currently, a considerable number of leaders at various levels within this army corps are amateur creation cadre members. Leadership taking the lead and setting an example is an important factor in promoting and advancing military amateur literary creation. The current main leaders of the army corps have personally participated in editing the "Dictionary of Party Affairs of the Communist Party of China," with the title written by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Some have researched and revised works with amateur authors, discussing literary and artistic creation issues. Various levels of party committees and leaders also pay attention to discovering and supporting new literary talents. According to statistics, more than 20 kinds of novels, essays, and reportage collections have been published and distributed; over 2,000 officers and soldiers, after demobilization and retirement, have been recruited by local news and cultural units as editors, reporters, and cultural cadres. Famous writer and screenwriter of the film "The Story of Liupu," Hu Shiyan, was originally from this army corps. The deputy director of the Propaganda Section of the Political Department of the army corps, Zhang Hongshun, had his short story "Party Committee Resolution" selected as a textbook by a middle school; the director of the Reconnaissance Section of the Command Department, Huang Deyuan, has, in recent years, consecutively published two film literary scripts, one of which, "Mao Zedong and Chiang Kai-shek in Chongqing," is currently being filmed. The director of the Logistics Department's War Support Section, Du Shoulin, has, in the past three years, consecutively published two novellas and one reportage in "Liberation Army Literature" and "Kunlun." Among them, the reportage "Thin Tiger's Spirit" was published in the second issue of "Kunlun" this year and received high praise from the literary criticism circles in the capital, being hailed as "a distinctive work about the construction and production of our army," "a good teaching material for educating the troops on the tradition of hard struggle." Recently, the PLA Literature and Art Publishing House and the Cultural Department of the Political Department of the Shenyang Military Region jointly held a work discussion meeting in Harbin.

    部队业余文学人才的一个摇篮
    吴金明
    驻守在祖国北疆黑龙江省的某集团军，多年来，贯彻党的文艺路线、方针政策，继承和发扬我军群众文化工作的优良传统，积极培养文学新人，繁荣业余创作，成为沈阳军区文化工作的先进单位。
    这个集团军是一支具有光荣历史传统的部队，她的前身是新四军第三纵队。当年的司令员为了活跃部队文化工作，组织办起了《战地报》。几十年来，尽管人员换了一茬又一茬，但各级党委和领导始终不渝地把开展群众性的文化工作，看作是加强部队建设不可缺少的一个重要方面。
    这些年来，他们通过各种形式，努力发现和培养文学新人，进一步繁荣业余创作。采取“请进来，走出去”进行短期培训，不定期地举办业余创作骨干辅导班，请军内外的作家和文学编辑讲课，修改作品。对于有一定写作能力和发展前途的骨干，送到院校或报纸杂志社进行培养，建立了一支具有一定水平的创作骨干队伍。现在，这个集团军内有相当一部分各级领导干部，都是业余创作骨干分子。领导带头，身体力行，是推动和促进部队业余文学创作的一个重要因素。现任集团军的主要领导有的亲自参与主编由邓小平同志题写书名的《中国共产党党务工作大辞典》，有的和业余作者一起研究修改作品，探讨文艺创作问题。各级党委和领导也注意发现和扶持文学新人。据统计，目前已出版发行小说、散文、报告文学作品集20余种，《在这片热土上》出版后受到好评；2000多名干部战士转业退伍后，被地方新闻和文艺单位录用为编辑、记者和文化干部。著名作家、电影《柳堡的故事》编剧胡石言原先就是这个集团军的。集团军政治部宣传处副处长张洪舜的短篇小说《党委决议》，被一所中学选入教材；司令部侦察处长黄德元，近几年连续发表了两部电影文学剧本，其中《毛泽东和蒋介石在重庆》现正在拍摄中。后勤部战勤处长杜守林，3年来先后在《解放军文艺》、《昆仑》上发表两部中篇小说和一篇报告文学。其中报告文学《瘦虎雄风》在今年第二期《昆仑》上发表后，得到首都文学评论界的好评，被誉为“写我军生产建设的一篇有特色的作品”，“是对部队进行艰苦奋斗传统教育的好教材”。最近，解放军文艺出版社和沈阳军区政治部文化部联合在哈尔滨召开了作品讨论会。
