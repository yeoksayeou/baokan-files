	Multinational Corporations Accelerate "Marriage Strategy"

	With the development and expansion of regional economic cooperation and trade exchanges, multinational corporations, while strengthening and expanding their subsidiaries, are also accelerating the implementation of the so-called "marriage strategy," establishing various forms of cooperation and links with local companies to prevent regional protectionist measures from increasing their restrictions and influence.

	The gross national product and import-export trade volume of North America, Western Europe, and East Asia all hold important positions in the world economy and trade. With the gradual formation of the North American Free Trade Area, the unified internal market of the European Community, and the East Asian economic circle, the influence of these three regions on the development of the world economy and trade will become increasingly significant. Especially in the near term, this will first aid the development of the economy and trade within the region, but it will have a certain degree of protective and exclusive nature towards the outside. Therefore, multinational corporations mainly implement the "marriage strategy" within these three regions. The recent issue of Japan's "21st Century" magazine, when discussing the impact of the European Community's internal unified market to be completed by the end of 1992, said that what the Japanese are most concerned about is that such a unified market is "free" within the European Community, but "closed" to the outside. Therefore, "the Japanese must further expand and strengthen their operational bases within the European Community through cooperation with local enterprises and other forms, and strive to establish a foothold within the European Community."

	Multinational corporations implement the "marriage strategy" mainly in the following two forms:

	First, they acquire local companies and enterprises. Due to the increasing dispersion of shareholders, multinational corporations can now control another company by purchasing 15% or less of its shares.

	In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in corporate mergers and acquisitions. In 1975, the total value of mergers and acquisitions by U.S. companies was $11.8 billion. Since 1984, the value of mergers and acquisitions by U.S. companies has exceeded $100 billion each year. In 1988, the number of mergers and acquisitions by U.S. companies reached a record high of 3,310, involving $282.4 billion. Among these, foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies reached 325, with the transaction amount increasing by 30% from $42.3 billion in 1987 to $54.8 billion.

	In 1988, British companies' investments in acquiring U.S. companies reached $20.7 billion, ranking first. Capital-rich Japanese companies launched a strong offensive to acquire U.S. companies, with investments in acquisitions increasing tenfold to $10.4 billion, the largest of which was Bridgestone Tire Company of Japan acquiring Firestone Tire Company of the U.S. for $2.6 billion.

	Last year, U.S. companies' investments in acquiring European enterprises increased from $1.3 billion in 1987 to $3.6 billion. Financial experts predict that this year, U.S. companies' investments in acquiring European enterprises may reach $5 billion.

	Second, they invest in local enterprises and develop joint ventures. General Electric Company, ranked fifth in the U.S. by sales, has already established a joint venture with the largest electronics company in the UK for major household appliances and electronic equipment; American Telephone and Telegraph Company has agreed to establish a joint venture with the Italian Telephone Equipment Company to participate in a $25 billion plan aimed at improving the Italian telecommunications system; this January, the U.S. company Whirlpool reached an agreement with the Dutch electronics giant Philips to establish a joint venture.

	It is estimated that last year, 31% of U.S. companies' overseas investments were used for joint ventures, and by the end of this year, such investments may account for 40%.

	Multinational corporations expanding cooperation and links with overseas enterprises have driven the rapid increase in cross-border direct investment. According to statistics from the Japan External Trade Organization, by the end of 1987, the cumulative total of cross-border direct investment had reached $962.8 billion, an increase of 26.1% from the previous year. By mid-1988, the cumulative total of cross-border direct investment had exceeded $1 trillion.

	Multinational corporations expanding cooperation and links with overseas enterprises, expanding overseas production and sales networks, aim to pursue high profits, but objectively, this will promote the world economy to be more interdependent and gradually realize integration.

### 跨国公司加快“联姻战略”

    跨国公司加快“联姻战略”
    新华社记者　李长久
    随着区域性经济合作和贸易交往的发展和扩大，跨国公司在加强和扩大其子公司的过程中，还在加快推行所谓“联姻战略”，与当地公司建立各种形式的合作和联系，以防区域性保护主义措施增加对它们的限制和影响。
    北美、西欧和东亚的国民生产总值和进出口贸易额都在世界经济和贸易中占有重要地位，随着北美自由贸易区、欧洲共同体内部统一大市场和东亚经济圈的逐步形成，这三个地区对世界经济、贸易发展的影响将越来越大。特别在近期内，这首先有助于本地区内的经济和贸易的发展，而对外则具有一定程度的保护性和排他性。因此，跨国公司主要在这三个地区内推行“联姻战略”。日本《21世纪》月刊最近一期在谈到欧洲共同体将于1992年底建成内部统一大市场的影响时说，日本人普遍担心的是，这样的统一大市场在欧洲共同体内部是“自由的”，而对外则是“封闭的”。因此，“日本人必须通过与当地企业进行合作等形式进一步扩大和加强在欧洲共同体内部的活动据点，尽量在欧洲共同体内站稳脚跟。”
    跨国公司推行“联姻战略”，主要采取以下两种形式：
    第一，兼并当地的公司、企业。
    由于持股者日益分散，现在跨国公司购买另一家公司百分之十五或者低于这个比重的股份，前者便能够控制后者。
    近几年来，企业兼并事件急剧增加。1975年美国企业兼并总额为118亿美元，从1984年起美国企业兼并额每年都超过1000亿美元，1988年美国企业兼并事件达到创纪录的3310起，涉及金额达2824亿美元。其中：外国兼并美国企业达325起，交易额比1987年增加30％，从423亿美元增加到548亿美元。
    1988年英国公司兼并美国企业的投资达207亿美元，居第一位。资本雄厚的日本公司发起了兼并美国企业的强大攻势，1988年兼并美国企业的投资增加了10倍，达104亿美元，其中最大的一项交易是日本的布里奇斯通轮胎公司以26亿美元收购了美国的费尔斯通轮胎公司。
    去年美国公司在西欧兼并企业的投资从1987年的13亿美元增加到36亿美元，金融界人士预计，今年美国公司用于兼并西欧企业的投资可能达到50亿美元。
    第二，向当地企业投资，发展合资企业。
    按销售额排为美国第5大公司的通用电气公司已同英国最大的电子产品公司建立了主要家用电器和电子设备的合资企业；美国电话电报公司已同意与意大利电话设备公司建立合资企业，参加一项耗资250亿美元、旨在改进意大利电信系统的计划；今年1月美国惠尔普尔公司同荷兰的大型电子产品公司飞利浦有限公司达成了一项关于兴办合资企业的协议。
    据估计，去年美国企业国外投资中的31％用于合资企业，到今年底这种投资可能占40％。
    跨国公司扩大同海外企业的合作和联系，推动了跨国直接投资的急剧增加，据日本贸易振兴会统计，到1987年底，跨国直接投资累计总额已达9628亿美元，比上年增加了26.1％。到1988年中，跨国直接投资累计总额已突破1万亿美元。
    跨国公司扩大同海外企业的合作和联系，扩大海外生产和销售网络，目的是追求高额利润，但在客观上，将推动世界经济更加相互依存、逐步实现一体化。
