When talking about the contributions of carpentry expert Wu Yuanfu to the construction of the Asian Games, people cannot help but praise him. Wu Yuanfu is 63 years old this year. As early as the 1950s, he dedicated himself to the construction of major projects in the capital, participating in one important project after another, mastering a set of exquisite carpentry skills. Wu Yuanfu is a representative of the Fourth and Fifth National People's Congress. Chairman Mao and Premier Zhou have received him multiple times, giving him great encouragement and strength. Wu Yuanfu said, "Although I am old and not in good health, the Asian Games project is related to the country's honor. No matter who comes to find me, I will do my best to fulfill my duty."

It is with this belief that Wu Yuanfu has once again made significant contributions to the construction of the Asian Games.

One day, colleagues from Hebei Construction Company came to Wu Yuanfu, saying that the wooden floor of the sports hall they were building was not well laid, and they asked him to help. Wu Yuanfu was shocked when he saw the hall: the wooden floor, which had already been painted, was wavy and uneven in color, presenting a serious problem. After discussing with the site leaders, he decided to completely redo the work and resurface the floor.

Wu Yuanfu brought his self-designed and manufactured planing machine, which has eight functions including planing and grinding, into the hall. With the help of the workers, he first used the machine to remove all the paint, and after half a month, the wood showed its original color. Then, they worked tirelessly for another month and a half, re-planing the wooden floors of the competition, training, and artistic gymnastics halls, covering a total of over 4,000 square meters. This finally solved the problem, meeting the technical standards and receiving praise from the design, planning, and construction units.

Over the course of more than a year, Wu Yuanfu spent several months inviting him to Shijingshan, the Sports Institute, Yuetan, and Hongqiao Sports Gymnasiums to share his skills. Many long-time carpentry workers who saw his work praised him highly.

Currently, Wu Yuanfu is working on the wooden floor of the Hongqiao Gymnasium. Every Sunday, he goes to the construction site to personally teach six workers from the Third Division of the Second Construction Company of China State Construction Engineering Corporation, and he also gave them a set of planing machine drawings worth several thousand yuan. His dedication is greatly inspiring the enthusiasm of the workers on the site.

    亚运会工地上的一员老将——吴元福
    提起木工专家吴元福对亚运会工程建设的贡献，人们无不赞扬。吴元福今年63岁，早在50年代初，他就投身首都的建筑工程，参加了一个又一个重要工程的建设，练就了一手精湛的木工活。吴元福是全国第四、五届人大代表，毛主席、周总理曾多次接见他，给了他极大的鼓舞和力量。吴元福说：“我年龄虽大了，身体又不好，但亚运会工程关系国家荣誉，不管是谁来找，我都千方百计去尽义务。”
    吴元福正是抱着这种信念，又为亚运会工程建设立了新功。
    一天，河北一建的同志找到吴元福，说他们承建的体院体育馆木地板铺得不好，请他去帮忙。吴元福到馆内心头一惊：已经上了油漆的木地板波浪式起伏，颜色深浅不一，问题相当严重。他同工地领导商量后，决定大返工，重新刨面。
    吴元福把自己设计制造的具有刨、磨等8种功能的刨光机带进馆内，在工人们的协助下，先用机器把油漆全部磨掉，半个月后木质露出本色。接着，他们一鼓作气又干了半个多月，将比赛、训练、艺术体操馆的共4000多平方米的木地板重新刨了一遍，这才解决了问题，达到技术指标要求，受到设计、筹建和施工单位的好评。
    在一年多时间里，吴元福抽出几个月时间，应邀到石景山、体院、月坛和木樨园体育馆献技，一些长期从事木工的同志看了他的活赞不绝口。
    现在，吴元福正为木樨园馆的木地板操劳。他每个星期天都到工地手把手地给中建二局一公司三处的6名工人传授技术，还给他们赠送了一套价值几千元的刨光机图纸。他的奉献正大大激发着工地上工人的干劲。　震宇
