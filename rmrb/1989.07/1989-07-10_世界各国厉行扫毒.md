The current global proliferation of drugs has become increasingly rampant, posing serious threats to the social, economic, and public security of many countries and drawing widespread concern. In response, the 42nd United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution in the previous year, designating June 26 as the "International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking." Currently, curbing the spread of drugs and launching anti-drug campaigns have become a common task for the entire world.

In recent years, drug production has surged rapidly. The infamous "Golden Triangle" region (the border area of Thailand, Myanmar, and Laos) saw its opium production increase from 650 tons in 1986 to 925-1,230 tons in 1987, with last year being another "bountiful year." The "Golden Crescent" region (Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan) saw even faster growth in drug production, surpassing the Golden Triangle, with opium production reaching 735-1,360 tons in 1987. The Andes Mountains to the Amazon River valley in Latin America is also a major drug-producing area, with 162,000-214,000 tons of cocaine produced in 1987.

As drug production increases, drug trafficking activities have become more active, with drug trafficking "becoming the fastest-growing industry in the world today." The illegal drug trade has risen from $200 billion in 1978 to $300 billion in 1987, accounting for 9% of the world's total trade volume. In the United States alone, the annual trade volume exceeds $100 billion. In 1987, the U.S. seized 37.5 tons of cocaine, estimated to be only one-tenth of the actual smuggled amount. In Europe, the amount of cocaine seized in 1987 was 40 tons, with an estimated 60 tons in 1988.

The "militarization" of drug gangs and the "drug trafficking" of armed groups are another important feature of current drug trafficking activities. To counter government anti-drug efforts, some drug gangs have recruited and armed themselves, organizing armed protection. Western criminal organizations and armed groups have also engaged in large-scale drug trafficking for profit.

Due to the increasing spread of drugs, the number of drug users is also rising. It is estimated that there are currently 48 million drug users worldwide. The United States alone has 23 million "addicts," accounting for nearly half of the world's total drug users. The number of drug users in Western European countries is also increasing. In the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, the number of drug users is on the rise. In developing countries, drug use is spreading rapidly.

Faced with the increasing spread and threat of drugs, governments around the world are taking various measures to crack down on drug traffickers and users.

Enhancing laws and imposing strict penalties. The U.S. "Anti-Drug Abuse Act" stipulates that those who kill with drugs will be sentenced to death; penalties for drug possession and use have been increased. Spain has increased penalties for drug traffickers, with imprisonment increased to 14-23 years.

Strengthening international cooperation to jointly combat drugs. Currently, drug activities have crossed national and continental borders, making it difficult for a single country to effectively combat drugs. In recent years, many countries have strengthened bilateral or multilateral cooperation to jointly combat drug activities, achieving certain results. At the end of last year, representatives from more than 100 countries in Vienna adopted a new international convention on the prohibition of illicit drug trafficking, emphasizing the establishment of a new international anti-drug cooperation mechanism to jointly combat drug activities.

Forcefully eradicating illegally planted drug crops and promoting the cultivation of alternative crops. Many countries have made the elimination of illegal drug cultivation a primary goal in their anti-drug efforts.

Western criminal organizations, in addition to engaging in crimes such as robbery, assassination, extortion, gambling, and prostitution, also make drug trafficking one of their main activities. Severely cracking down on these criminal organizations is an important part of anti-drug efforts.

Due to the efforts of various countries to strengthen anti-drug measures, the spread of drugs has been somewhat controlled. However, the proliferation of drugs has deep social and economic roots and is a reflection of "social comprehensive syndrome," related to various social contradictions. Given that many countries will find it difficult to solve a host of social problems in the short term, a long-term, arduous effort will be required to ultimately win the war against drugs.

    世界各国厉行扫毒
    李国福
    当前，世界性毒品泛滥日益猖獗，已给许多国家的社会、经济、治安带来严重危害，引起各国普遍关注。为此，去年第四十二届联大通过决议，确定每年的六月二十四日为“反对麻醉品乱用和非法贩毒国际日”。目前，遏制毒品泛滥、开展反毒斗争已成为全世界面临的共同任务。
    这些年来，毒品生产迅速增长。著名的“金三角”地区（泰国、缅甸、老挝三国交界地带）的鸦片产量从一九八六年的六百五十吨增至一九八七年的九百二十五—一千二百三十吨，去年“又是丰收年”。“金新月”地区（阿富汗、伊朗，巴基斯坦）的毒品生产增长更快，产量已超过“金三角”，一九八七年鸦片产量达七百三十五—一千三百六十吨。拉美安第斯山脉至亚马逊河河谷也是毒品重要产区，一九八七年共产可卡因十六点二万—二十一点四万吨。
    随着毒品产量的增加，贩毒活动也日趋活跃，贩毒“已成为当今世界上发展最快的行业”。非法毒品交易额已由一九七八年的二千亿美元上升到一九八七年的三千亿美元，相当于世界贸易总额的百分之九。仅美国一国，每年交易额就超过一千亿美元。一九八七年美国缴获可卡因三十七点五吨，估计这只是实际走私量的十分之一。欧洲古柯碱的缴获量一九八七年为四十吨，估计一九八八年达六十吨。
    毒品集团“武装化”，武装集团“贩毒化”，是当今贩毒活动又一重要特点。为对抗各国政府扫毒，一些毒品集团招兵买马，组织武装保护。西方各种黑社会组织、武装团伙为牟取暴利大肆贩毒。
    由于毒品的日益泛滥，吸毒人数也不断增加。据估计，目前全世界吸毒人数已达四千八百万。仅美国就有“瘾君子”二千三百万，占世界吸毒总数近二分之一。西欧各国的吸毒者也越来越多。在苏联、东欧，吸毒者人数呈上升趋势。在发展中国家，吸毒也迅速蔓延。
    面对毒品的日益泛滥和威协，各国政府正在采取各种措施，打击贩毒吸毒分子。
    完善法律，从严制裁。美国的“毒品乱用取缔法”规定，因毒品杀人者处以死刑；对毒品持有者和使用者加重处罚。西班牙加重对贩毒分子的惩处，监禁增加到十四—二十三年。
    加强国际合作，共同反毒。当前毒品活动已跨越国界、洲界，单独一个国家反毒是难以奏效的。近年来许多国家加强双边或多边合作，联合打击毒品活动，取得一定效果。去年底一百多个国家的代表在维也纳通过了新的关于禁止非法贩毒国际公约，强调建立国际反毒合作新体制，共同打击毒品活动。
    强行铲除非法种植的毒品作物，推行种植替代农作物计划。许多国家把消灭非法种植毒品作为扫毒的首要目标。
    西方的各种黑社会组织除从事抢劫、暗杀、勒索、聚赌、营娼等犯罪活动外，贩毒也是它们的主要行当之一。严厉打击这些黑社会势力也是扫毒的重要一环。
    由于各国纷纷采取措施，强化扫毒，毒品泛滥的形势已有所控制。但毒品泛滥有其深刻的社会、经济根源，是“社会综合症”的反映，与社会各种矛盾相关联。鉴于许多国家短期内还难以解决成堆的社会问题，要彻底打赢反毒这场战争还须长期艰苦的努力。
