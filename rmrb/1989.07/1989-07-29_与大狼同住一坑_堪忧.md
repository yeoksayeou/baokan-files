Currently, the number of errors in books and newspapers has reached an astonishing level. One newspaper mistakenly wrote "Hunan Luoyang City" instead of "Henan Luoyang City," and wrote "Jiangxi Fourth Cotton Mill" as "Jiangxi Mao Fourth Cotton Mill." Even more astonishing, a set of books published by the Guangzhou New Century Publishing House mistakenly wrote "World War II" as "World War III," and "mail-order bride" as "mail-order mother." Due to the sheer number of errors, the books were sent to be pulped before they could even be published.

Needless to say, some of these errors have caused unnecessary losses and led to many bitter laughs. It is said that during the war between Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yuxiang, and Yan Xishan, a subordinate of General Feng Yuxiang mistakenly confused the names of two counties in Henan—Qinyang and Miyang (which are hundreds of miles apart)—leading to the loss of soldiers and a defeat. For this, General Feng was particularly angry and even executed a high-ranking officer.

In the 1950s and 1960s, we often saw articles by scholars like Ye Shengtao and Lü Shuxiang discussing errors and awkward sentences in books and newspapers. In recent years, errors in books and newspapers have become rampant, but on the other hand, articles discussing these errors have become extremely rare. This situation seems to have become so common that people no longer find it unusual.

During the "Gang of Four" era, it was rumored that a sent-down youth wrote a letter home saying he was living in the countryside with a "big wolf (mother)" in the same "pit (kang)." He also wrote that his father had been "hanged" (called back) from the cadre school, causing a false alarm. Who can say that we are not cultivating illiterate scholars now?

### “与大狼同住一坑”堪忧

    “与大狼同住一坑”堪忧
    目前，书报上错误之多，达到了惊人的程度。某报把“河南洛阳市”错成“湖南洛阳市”，将“九江第四棉纺厂”写作“九江茅四棉纺厂”。更有甚者，广州新世纪出版社出版的一套书中，竟能把“二次世界大战”错成“三次世界大战”，“邮购新娘”错成“邮购亲娘”，因错误太多，以致书还没有出版，就被送去化浆了。
    不用说，一些错误给人们造成了不应有的损失，闹出了许多令人酸楚的笑话，据传，当年蒋、冯、阎大战，由于冯玉祥将军部下一个人把河南的两个县名——沁阳和泌阳（两者相距几百里）弄错，以致损兵折将，吃了败仗；为此，冯将军特别生气，还处决了一位高级军官。
    记得在五六十年代，我们经常可以从报刊上看到叶圣陶、吕叔湘等诸先生谈书报上错别字及病句的文章。近几年，书报上的错别字大量出现，而另一方面，谈论这些错别字的文章却又特别稀少。这种状况，似乎大家都习以为常，不足为怪了。
    “四人帮”统治时期，曾经传说，有位知青给家里写信，说他在乡下与“大狼（娘）”住在一个“坑（炕）”里；把父亲由干校上调写成“上吊”，闹了一场虚惊。谁敢说我们现在这样，不是在培养白字先生呢。
