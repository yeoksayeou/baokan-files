"Education first" is a consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government. To ensure that all school-age children receive education, the national constitution stipulates that children and adolescents aged 5 to 17 can enjoy one year of compulsory pre-school education and a 10-year compulsory high school education. To this end, the government has built more than 50,000 kindergartens and over 9,500 primary and secondary schools. Currently, out of Korea's population of over 18 million, more than 5 million people are receiving compulsory education.

In creating good learning conditions for students, the state has taken measures to facilitate students' commute: urban students do not need to cross roads to go to school; rural students do not need to traverse mountains and valleys to attend school nearby. In the mountainous region of Rangan County in northern Korea, to enable more than 20 students in a deep valley to attend school, the state specially allocated funds to build a "school commuting railway." Korea has numerous islands, and to solve the problem of island children attending school, the state established branch schools on more than 1,500 islands, accounting for about one-third of the total number of primary schools in the country. There is a small island called "Water Transport Island" on the west coast, with only 3 children, and a branch school has been established there. Gwon Sun-bok, Director of the General Education Department of the Korean Education Commission, told reporters: "Korea has achieved the goal of enrolling all school-age children. Students not only receive free compulsory education in schools, but all extracurricular education, including field trips and summer camps, is also free."

In implementing the 11-year compulsory education system, especially in the compulsory middle school stage, Korea places great emphasis on the combination of theory and practice. They believe that only by organically combining the two can they cultivate the talents needed by the state. As early as 1975, Korea clearly proposed that all middle school students must master one or more technologies related to the modernization of the national economy. To achieve this goal, the following two measures were mainly taken: 1. Increase basic courses such as electricity and mechanics, and set up laboratories and school-run factories for cars, tractors, etc. Under the guidance of teachers, students personally practice and operate. 2. Link extracurricular activities with technical education. The youth palaces scattered in major cities are the main bases for students to broaden their horizons, enrich their knowledge, and develop their skills. The Pyongyang Youth Palace, with a total construction area of 50,000 square meters, has set up more than 200 activity rooms for cars, tractors, television, medicine, mechanical manufacturing, electronic computers, etc., with nearly 10,000 students participating in practical activities every day. Recently, another youth palace has been built on Kwangbok Street, with a construction area of 87,000 square meters.

Since the implementation of compulsory education nationwide, a large number of outstanding students have been sent to universities and various departments of the national economy. Since the war, the more than one million intellectuals trained by Korea themselves have become the backbone of socialist construction.

    朝鲜义务教育在发展
    本报记者　徐宝康
    “教育先行”是朝鲜劳动党和政府的一贯方针。为了让学龄儿童全部受到教育，国家宪法规定：凡5岁至17岁的儿童和少年都可享受学前1年义务教育和10年制高中义务教育。为此，政府兴建了5万多所幼儿园和9500多所小学和中学。目前，在朝鲜1800多万人口中，享受义务教育的人数达500多万。
    在创造学生良好就学条件方面，国家采取了一条列方便学生的措施：城市学生上学不必横穿马路；农村学生不用翻山越岭便可就近读书。位于朝鲜北部丛山峻岭的狼林郡，为了让20多名深山沟里的学生能够上学，国家专门拨款修建一条“通学铁路”。朝鲜岛屿众多，为解决岛屿儿童上学难的问题，国家在1500多个岛屿上设立了分校，相当于全国小学总数的1／3。西海岸有一个名叫“水运岛”的弹丸小岛，岛上只有3名儿童，也办了一所分校。朝鲜教育委员会普通教育部权顺福局长对记者说：“朝鲜已实现了学龄儿童一个不漏地全部入学。学生不仅在学校受到免费义务教育，而且所有课外教育，包括参观、夏令营等也都一律免费。”
    朝鲜在实行11年义务教育中，尤其是中学义务教育阶段十分强调理论与实践相结合。他们认为，只有两者有机地结合起来，才能培养出国家需要的有用人才。早在1975年朝鲜就明确提出，所有中学生必须掌握一种以上同国民经济现代化有关的技术。为达到这一目标，主要采取了以下两点措施：1、增加电气、机械等基础知识课程，并开办汽车、拖拉机等实验室和校办工厂。在教员的指导下，由学生亲自动手实习和操作。2、课外活动与技术教育挂钩。遍布于各主要城市的学生少年宫，是学生开阔眼界、丰富知识、练就本领的主要基地。总建筑面积5万平方米的平壤学生少年宫开设了汽车、拖拉机、电视、医药、机械制造、电子计算机等200多个活动室，每天有近万名学生到这里参加实践活动。最近又在光复大街新建起了一座学生少年宫，建筑面积达8.7万平方米。
    全国实行义务教育以来，大批优秀学生被输送到大学和国民经济各部门。战后，朝鲜自己培养起来的上百万人的知识分子大军已成为社会主义建设的中坚力量。
