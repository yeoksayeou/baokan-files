Reporters recently visited various bookstalls on the streets of the capital and found that the once prevalent obscene publications have been cleared out, making the shelves of "spiritual food" look much cleaner. This is a notable result of Beijing's efforts to rectify the book market.

According to statistics from the Municipal Press and Publication Bureau, in the half-month period from July 10 to 25, the city confiscated over 55,800 books and magazines that fall within the prohibited range, and seized 130,000 illegal publications in the wholesale sector. The business licenses of more than 20 individual book vendors who violated the ban and continued to sell illegal publications were revoked.

    北京大力整顿书刊市场
    精神食粮“卫生”多了
    据新华社北京7月29日电　（记者邱永生、李京华）记者近日逛首都街头的众多书摊，发现一度充斥的黄色书刊被扫地出门，“精神食粮”的货架显得“卫生”多了。这是北京市大力整顿书刊市场取得的显著效果。
    据市新闻出版局日前统计，在7月10日到25日的半个月时间内，全市共收缴属查禁范围的书刊55800多册，在批发环节查处违法书刊13万册；吊销20多家违反禁令、继续兜售违法书刊的个体书商营业执照。
