The Hengyang Branch of the Bank of China smuggled and sold gold jewelry worth over 100 million yuan from a gold shop in the British-controlled area of Shatoujiao, Shenzhen, and was investigated by the Hengyang City Suburban District Administration for Industry and Commerce.

According to preliminary investigations by the Hengyang City Suburban District Administration for Industry and Commerce, the Hengyang Branch of the Bank of China, without customs approval, smuggled gold jewelry on four occasions from July 15, 1988, to November 20, 1988. A total of 5,084 pieces of gold jewelry, weighing 27,709.163 grams, were purchased from a gold shop in the British-controlled area of Shatoujiao, Shenzhen. Subsequently, the branch marked up the prices for so-called deposit mobilization and illegally sold 27,635.603 grams of gold jewelry, totaling over 3.4 million yuan, with a profit margin of over 480,000 yuan. The remaining 73.56 grams of gold jewelry were seized by the industry and commerce authorities during an illegal processing operation in March of this year.

To evade customs supervision, the Hengyang Branch of the Bank of China, on the first three occasions, purchased 15,963.038 grams of gold jewelry, which were smuggled into the country in small quantities by the branch manager Xiao Guohua and the office director Zhao Xiuping, among others. On the fourth occasion, 11,736.125 grams of gold jewelry were purchased at a price higher than the market rate, and the Hong Kong merchants were allowed to deliver the jewelry to the Furen Hotel in Shenzhen after negotiations with Xiao Guohua.

The price per gram of the gold jewelry purchased was over 60 yuan higher than the state's import price for gold jewelry. This batch of gold jewelry cost an additional 17 million yuan. Simultaneously, the state lost 13.8 million yuan in import tariffs from Hong Kong merchants and over 2.2 million yuan in value-added tax.

In the process of purchasing and selling this batch of gold jewelry, the Hengyang Branch of the Bank of China also seriously violated state regulations by not keeping formal accounts and only maintaining off-book accounts, leading to chaotic expenditures. The branch's responsible parties and handling personnel also engaged in other serious acts of using their positions for personal gain. On August 20 of last year, during a trip to Shatoujiao to purchase gold jewelry, branch manager Xiao Guohua brought his wife and daughter, and Zhao Xiuping brought his husband for sightseeing, with all expenses covered by public funds.

The case is currently under further investigation.

    衡阳支行走私贩卖黄金首饰
    造成国家经济损失百余万元  主要责任者正受查处
    本报长沙7月16日电　记者吴兴华报道：中国银行衡阳支行从深圳沙头角中英街港属金店走私贩私价值达百余万元的黄金首饰，受到湖南省衡阳市郊区工商管理局查处。
    据衡阳市郊区工商局初步查证：中国银行衡阳支行未经海关批准，于1988年7月15日至11月20日，先后4次走私，从深圳沙头角中英街港属金店购进黄金首饰5084件，计27709.163克。尔后加价进行所谓揽储，用去和非法销售黄金首饰27635.603克，计金额340.7万多元，进销差价4.8万多元，余下的黄金首饰73.56克于今年3月在该行非法加工时，被工商部门现场查获。
    中国银行衡阳支行走私贩私黄金，为了逃避海关监督，前3次购买的15963.038克黄金首饰，由行长肖国和及该行办公室主任赵秀平等数人，采取化整为零的办法，分散带入境内的。第4次购买的11736.125克黄金首饰，是行长肖国和与港商协商好后，以高于当时市场挂牌价格，让港商送到深圳芙蓉宾馆的。
    他们购买的黄金首饰价格每克比国家进口黄金首饰的价格高60多元。这批黄金首饰共多花人民币170多万元，同时，使国家少收港商进口关税138万余元、增值税22万多元。
    在购销这批黄金首饰中，中国银行衡阳支行还严重违反国家有关规定，没有正式记帐，只作帐外帐，乱开支。该行负责人和经办人还有其他严重以权谋私行为。去年8月20日去沙头角购买黄金首饰时，行长肖国和带自己的妻子、女儿，赵秀平带自己的丈夫去游玩，一切开支由公费开销。
    目前，此案正在继续查处中。
