Heilongjiang Province is tackling hot issues to promote clean government. The province has implemented a policy of openness in four key areas of college graduate allocation to strengthen constraints and prevent corruption. The allocation work is currently proceeding smoothly according to this principle.

This year, Heilongjiang Province has over 16,000 college graduates. According to relevant departments, the allocation of graduates is facing a situation where supply exceeds demand for the first time. In response to these new circumstances, the Heilongjiang Provincial Government believes that it is necessary to implement openness throughout the allocation process to strengthen students' and society's supervision of the allocation work and promote clean government. The four key areas of openness are as follows:

First, in the school stage, the national allocation policies, principles, and requirements for employment units, as well as the allocation plans, must be made public. The academic performance, political ideology, and comprehensive moral evaluation rankings of graduates, as well as the conditions and reasons for those who need special consideration, must also be made public. The allocation results must be publicly announced. All of the above information must be promptly posted for all graduates to supervise.

Second, in the provincial-level planning and allocation stage, supervision must be strengthened. Any requests to adjust the allocation of graduates through notes or connections must not be processed by the planning and allocation departments. Those who repeatedly interfere with the normal allocation process will be criticized and stopped, or publicly exposed. The conditions, principles, and procedures for transfers must be made public. The staff of the planning and allocation departments must be strict with themselves, and any improper behavior will be punished.

Third, in the municipal-level allocation stage, openness must be ensured. The list of graduates for secondary allocation, their majors, academic performance, specific employment units, and allocation results must all be made public.

Fourth, in the employment unit stage, openness must be ensured. Any graduates recommended or introduced by individuals or through certain connections must be publicly disclosed by the employment unit in an appropriate setting, stating who recommended or introduced them. Then, based on actual needs, the leadership team will collectively decide whether to accept them.

    黑龙江抓热点问题促廉政
    高校毕业生分配四公开
    从需求信息到分配结果一律张榜公布接受监督
    据新华社哈尔滨7月16日电  （通讯员孔令学、记者徐江善）黑龙江省在毕业生分配工作中，对4个关键环节实行公开，强化约束机制，避免腐败现象。目前，分配工作正按这一原则顺利进行。
    黑龙江省今年共有高校毕业生16000多人。据有关部门统计预测，毕业生分配首次出现供大于求局面。针对这些新情况，黑龙江省政府认为，必须在整个分配过程中实行公开化，切实加强学生和社会对分配工作的监督，促进廉政建设。公开的4个关键环节是：
    一、在学校环节，国家分配方针、政策、原则公开，用人单位需求信息和分配计划公开，毕业生学习成绩、政治思想和品德综合测评名次公开，需要照顾的毕业生条件和理由公开，分配结果公开。上述内容要及时张榜公布，让全体毕业生实行监督。
    二、省级计划调配环节要加强监督。任何人写条子、通过关系说情，要求给毕业生调整分配的，计划、调配部门一律不予办理。对多次纠缠、干扰正常分配的，要批评制止，或公开“曝光”。要把改派的条件、原则和办理程序公开。计划、调配部门的工作人员要严于律己，如有不端行为，将给予惩处。
    三、地市调配环节公开。做到毕业生二次分配的名单、所学专业、学习成绩、具体用人单位名单及分配结果全部公开。
    四、用人单位环节公开。凡个人或通过某种关系推荐和介绍来的毕业生，用人单位要在一定场合把谁推荐的、谁介绍的进行公开，然后根据实际需要由领导班子集体决定是否接收。
