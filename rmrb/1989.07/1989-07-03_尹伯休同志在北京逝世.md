The farewell ceremony for the late Comrade Yin Boqiu, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a veteran revolutionary, and the former director of the preservation department of the Chinese History Museum, was held on June 27 at the Baobai Mountain Revolutionary Cemetery in Beijing.

Comrades Chu Tunan and Yang Hanqing, as well as the Ministry of Culture, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, and other departments, sent wreaths.

Yin Boqiu passed away in Beijing on June 4 at the age of 90.

Yin Boqiu was from Renshou County, Sichuan. In 1925, he entered the Whampoa Military Academy and joined the Communist Party of China the same year. After the Northern Expedition began, he was assigned by the party to work in the Political Department of the Whampoa Military Academy, where he did a great deal of work to promote the party's line, policies, and the New Three Principles of the People. After the failure of the Great Revolution, he was sent by Comrade Zhou Enlai to Wuhan and served as the chief of the propaganda section of the Political Department of the Eighth Army. Later that year, he went to Moscow to study military science.

Upon his return to China, he actively participated in the left-wing cultural movement and anti-Japanese propaganda activities and was elected as a member of the National Film Industry Anti-Japanese Association. During the War of Liberation, he was approved by the organization to work undercover as the chief of the science department of the Sichuan Provincial Puppet Government, engaging in military subversion work and contributing to the cause of the people's liberation.

Over the course of more than 60 years, Yin Boqiu experienced many hardships and tribulations, but he remained loyal to the party and the people's cause. After liberation, he served as the director of the office of the Cultural and Educational Commission of the Southwest Military and Political Commission and the director of the office of the Central Committee for the Elimination of Illiteracy. Even after his retirement, he wrote a large number of historical materials about the party while battling illness.
