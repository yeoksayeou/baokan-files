The Ministry of Railways began implementing the summer passenger train schedule today.

Currently, all scheduled trains that were suspended in June due to decreased passenger flow have resumed operation. As of July, railway passenger traffic has rapidly increased. By mid-July, the daily average number of passengers sent by the railway was 3,378,000, with a peak of 3,509,000 on July 17. Major passenger stations in Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai, Zhengzhou, and other cities have all seen passenger volumes exceed those of the same period last year.

The Ministry of Railways plans to add 14 pairs of passenger trains during this summer vacation period. So far, 10 pairs have already started operating, including routes such as Kunming to Guangzhou, Wuhan to Zhengzhou to Shanghai, Wuhan to Guangzhou, and Shenyang to Beijing.
