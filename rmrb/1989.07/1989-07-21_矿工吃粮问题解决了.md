Your newspaper published a letter from a reader on April 8, page six, titled "Unable to Receive State-Allocated Grain, Over 2,000 Coal Miners Are Anxious." The letter criticized the Tenzhou City Grain Bureau for the delayed supply of grain and oil to the Jiangzhuang Coal Mine, which affected coal production.

Regarding this issue, our bureau contacted the Tenzhou City Grain Bureau to discuss and find a solution: before the mine establishes a grain and oil distribution point, temporarily handle grain supply procedures at the nearest grain shop in Cai Li. The city flour mill and government grain shop will supply grain and oil to address the workers' dining needs. The Jiangzhuang Coal Mine expressed satisfaction with the grain department's cooperative attitude. The Tenzhou City Grain Bureau is urging the Jiangzhuang Coal Mine to expedite the construction of a grain shop to ensure the proper supply of grain and oil to the coal miners.

    矿工吃粮问题解决了
    你报4月8日第六版刊登了《吃不上国家计划供应粮，2000多名矿工惶惶不安》的读者来信，批评滕州市粮食局对蒋庄煤矿粮油供应不及时，使煤炭生产受到影响的问题。
    对此，我局与滕州市粮食局联系，研究出了解决办法：在矿上未建粮油网点之前，暂从距矿最近的柴里粮店办理供粮手续，由市面粉厂、机关粮店供应粮油，以解决职工吃饭问题。蒋庄煤矿对粮食部门的积极合作态度表示满意。滕州市粮食局督促蒋庄煤矿抓紧建设粮店，以便安排好煤矿工人的粮油供应。
