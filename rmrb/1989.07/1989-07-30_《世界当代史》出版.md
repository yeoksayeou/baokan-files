Edition: 6

The book "World Contemporary History" has been published. It is edited by Wang Sidi and Qian Hong from East China Normal University, with contributions from professors from Shandong Normal University, South China Normal University, Tianjin Normal University, and other institutions. The authors strive to elucidate the dynamics and laws of world contemporary history over the past forty-plus years. The book divides the post-World War II history into two stages, using the late 1960s to early 1970s as the dividing line, while some historical events are described with overlapping timelines. Notably, the authors extend the historical lens to the mid-to-late 1980s, covering major global events of 1988. This book represents a new attempt in the construction of university-level history textbooks. The book has been published by Higher Education Press.

    《世界当代史》出版
    本书由华东师大王斯德、钱洪主编，山东师大、华南师大、天津师大等校部分教授参加编写。作者力求阐述四十多年来世界当代史的运动过程及其规律。该书以六十年代末到七十年代初为标界，将二次大战后世界史分为两个阶段，而对一些历史事件的叙述又有所交错。可贵的是，作者把历史镜头推向八十年代中后期，一九八八年的世界重大事件亦已涉及。该书是高校历史教材建设的新尝试。本书已由高等教育出版社出版。　（王方宪）
