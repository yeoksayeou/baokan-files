Today, the vice chairman of the Gansu Provincial Price Commission, Wang Yuntian, was expelled from the Party and removed from his administrative post; the vice secretary of the Provincial Government, Wang Xinxiang, was ordered to stop work for investigation. The decision was announced by the provincial Party committee and government at the ongoing seventh plenary session of the second provincial Party committee, and was made public through local media. This news has caused a sensation in the provincial capital, Lanzhou. The general reaction is one of approval. People say, "The Party and government are serious about eliminating corruption and punishing official malfeasance."

The decision was announced by Li Zichi, the provincial Party secretary, and Jia Zhijie, the provincial governor. According to reports, during his tenure as deputy head of the Wuwei Regional Administration, Wang Yuntian, under the pretext of raising funds for enterprises, violated national regulations, abused his power, and transferred 1,000 tons of white sugar from the Huangyang Town Sugar Factory to sell at high prices to some companies in the region, reaping illegal profits of 630,000 yuan, for which he bears leadership responsibility. He also allocated 13 tons of white sugar to an individual in Lanzhou City to sell at high prices, seriously disrupting the market. He transferred 4 tons of white sugar from the factory without compensation, and the whereabouts are unknown. He also refused to explain. The vice secretary of the Provincial Government, Wang Xinxiang, is implicated in a major case being investigated by relevant departments, and his errors are serious.

At the same time as announcing the above decisions, Li Zichi and Jia Zhijie also publicly exposed the misdeeds of some leading officials in key positions who have engaged in corrupt behavior. For example, a prefecture-level official, under the pretext of going to Hong Kong for study and inspection, arbitrarily increased the number of people going to Hong Kong, raised more than 300,000 yuan, and was cheated in Hong Kong, causing serious economic losses. Another deputy prefecture-level official used his power to support and shield his old colleague, embezzling public funds to buy a house for himself. A county magistrate used public funds to treat a family member who did not receive public medical care, spending thousands of yuan, and then sold the unused medicine, using the opportunity to raise funds for his wife. After his wife's death, he held a grand funeral, which had a very bad influence. The provincial Party committee and government require that such cases be investigated and seriously dealt with by relevant departments and units.

    甘肃查处有腐败行为的领导干部
    省物价委员会副主任王运天被开除党籍撤销职务
    省府副秘书长王信祥与一大案有牵连被停职检查
    本报兰州7月9日电　记者张述圣报道：今天，甘肃省物价委员会副主任王运天被开除党籍、撤销行政职务；省政府副秘书长王信祥被责令停职检查，省委的这个决定通过当地新闻媒介公开披露后，在省城兰州引起轰动。此间普遍的反应是赞赏。人们说，党和政府清除腐败、惩治官倒“动真格的”。
    这个决定，是省委书记李子奇、省长贾志杰在目前正在举行的省委七届二次全委扩大会议上宣布的。据了解，省物价委员会副主任王运天在担任武威地区行署副专员期间，借口为企业集资，违反国家规定，利用职权，从黄羊镇糖厂调出白糖1000吨，给地区的一些公司高价出售牟取暴利63万元，负有领导责任；将13吨白糖批给兰州市的一个个体户高价出售，严重扰乱市场；从糖厂无偿调出白糖4吨，下落不明，本人又拒不交待。省政府副秘书长王信祥同有关部门查处的一起大案有牵连，错误严重。
    李子奇、贾志杰在宣布上述决定的同时，还对一些身居要职有腐败行为的领导干部的劣迹公开“曝光”。例如，有一个地级干部借口到香港学习考察，擅自增加赴港人员，摊派集资30多万元，在港被骗，造成严重经济损失。还有个副地级干部，利用职权，支持、袒护他的老同事，骗取公款，为自己购买住房。有一个县长用公款给不享受公费医疗的家属治病，花销几千元，并把没有用完的药品转手倒卖，还借机为老婆募捐，老婆死后又大办丧事，影响极坏。省委、省政府要求，诸如此类的案件，各有关部门和单位，一定要抓紧查证，严肃处理。
