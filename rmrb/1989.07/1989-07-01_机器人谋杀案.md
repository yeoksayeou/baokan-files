A bizarre robot murder case has drawn the attention of the global legal, technological, and media communities.

Recently, world-renowned chess grandmaster and Soviet Union chess champion Nikolai Gudkov engaged in a six-day chess match with a robot. Gudkov, with his superior skills, won three consecutive games, fully demonstrating the undeniable superiority of human intelligence over machines. Unfortunately, the robot, "losing its temper," became "desperate" and "angry" in its "frustration." During the early moves of the fourth game, it independently altered the electrical current sent to the chessboard, causing its opponent to suddenly die from an unexplained electric shock. Soviet police, after meticulously investigating the scene, confirmed that the electronic circuits in the environment were intact and concluded that the robot had "intentionally killed a person." They immediately arrested the perpetrator and, within the next two months, brought it to trial. The question of whether the robot should be "sentenced to death" is now under public scrutiny as the trial proceeds.

    机器人谋杀案
    一宗不可思议的机器人谋杀案引起了全球司法界、科技界和新闻界的普遍关注。
    最近，世界级象棋大师、苏联国际象棋冠军尼古拉·古德科夫与一位机器人进行了连续六天的象棋比赛，古德科夫以高超的技艺连胜三局，充分证明了人的智慧对于机器人具有无庸置疑的优越性。不料，机器人“输红了眼”，在“绝望”的时候恼“羞”成“怒”，在第四局刚刚开战的几步棋时，“他”自行改变输往棋盘的电流量，致使对手突然神秘地触电身亡。苏联刑警经过对现场的周密侦讯，确认环境电子线路完好无损，断定机器人是“故意杀人”，立即逮捕了凶犯正身，并于近两个月内将其送上法庭受审。机器人行凶该不该“抵命”，人们正注视着审判结果。
