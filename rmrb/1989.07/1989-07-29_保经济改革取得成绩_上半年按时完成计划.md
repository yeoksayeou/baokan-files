People's Daily, Belgrade, July 28th. Reporter Yan Zheng reports: According to recent data released by the Central Statistical Office in Sofia, Bulgaria has completed its economic development plan for the first half of this year on schedule. Compared to the same period last year, labor productivity has increased by 9.1%, wages have risen by 2.4%, and agricultural production has also shown significant growth.

Particularly noteworthy is the 10% increase in the production of goods for the domestic market and a 7% increase in retail trade. This marks another satisfactory achievement for Bulgaria in its economic development following last year's successes.

The newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" believes that these achievements are due to the "Law on Economic Activity" issued by the Bulgarian State Council at the beginning of this year, which has mobilized the enormous enthusiasm and creativity of various labor collectives. This, along with the so-called "Order No. 56," further promoted the economic reforms declared at the solemn meeting of the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party in July 1987. The reforms stipulate that Bulgarian residents can establish private enterprises with up to 10 employees, allow the establishment of various joint-stock companies, and insist on attracting more foreign investment into joint ventures (i.e., joint-stock companies).

    保经济改革取得成绩
    上半年按时完成计划
    本报贝尔格莱德7月28日电　记者严正报道：据不久前索非亚中央统计局公布的资料，今年上半年保加利亚按时完成了经济发展计划，与去年同期相比，劳动生产率增长9.1％，工资增长2.4％，农业生产也有明显增长。
    特别引人注目的是国内市场商品的生产增长10％，零售商业约增长7％。这是继去年之后，保加利亚在发展经济方面又取得了满意的成绩。
    《工人事业报》认为，上述成绩的取得是由于今年年初保加利亚国务委员会颁布的《经济活动法则》调动了各劳动集体巨大的积极性和创造性。这与被称为“第56号法令”的文件进一步推动了1987年7月保共中央全会庄重宣布的经济改革，它规定保加利亚居民可以建立最多能雇佣10名工人的私有企业，允许建立各种股份公司，坚持更大规模地吸引外资向混合企业（即合资企业）投资等。
