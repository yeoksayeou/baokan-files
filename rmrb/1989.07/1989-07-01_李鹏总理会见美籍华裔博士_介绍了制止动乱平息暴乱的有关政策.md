Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 1st.

Premier Li Peng met with American citizen of Chinese descent Dr. Huang Jinbo today at the Zhongnanhai Purple Light Pavilion. Li Peng introduced relevant policies on stopping turmoil and quelling the riots.

The 47-year-old Dr. Huang Jinbo has served as the mayor of Sherrytown, USA, twice and has been elected to the city council three times. At his request, Li Peng emphasized the policies of the Chinese Communist Party and government in stopping turmoil and quelling the riots.

Li Peng said, "We will strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions. We will strike and punish those who planned and directed the turmoil and riots both openly and secretly; those who colluded with anti-China forces abroad to plot the overthrow of China's socialist system; those who engaged in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing; especially those who, after serving their sentences, continue to commit crimes. We will handle these people according to law, representing the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, and this is China's internal affair."

Li Peng said, the Chinese Communist Party and government have repeatedly stated that for those students who participated in marches, sit-ins, hunger strikes, and even had extreme behavior, although we do not approve of their actions, as long as they have not violated criminal law, we will adopt a lenient policy. However, we hope they will reflect seriously and learn from their mistakes.

When discussing the issue of overseas Chinese students having engaged in extreme behavior, Li Peng pointed out that this was due to their being misled by public opinion and not knowing the facts. Li Peng believes that once they understand the truth, they will gradually change their views. He said, the Party and government, as in the past, look forward to their returning to the motherland after completing their studies to contribute to the country's modernization drive.

Li Peng said, some people abroad do not understand or even criticize China's quelling of the riots. Apart from some people having biases, most are deceived by public opinion and know very little about China's national conditions. "I believe this situation will gradually change."

Li Peng finally pointed out: "China is a country with 1.1 billion people. As long as the political situation is stable, the economy is developing, and the Party's leadership is united, our country has a great future."

The Director of the State Council's Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, Liao Hui, attended the meeting.

On June 29th, Vice Premier Wu Xueqian had met with Dr. Huang Jinbo and had a friendly conversation with him.

    介绍了制止动乱平息暴乱的有关政策
    新华社北京7月1日电  李鹏总理今天在中南海紫光阁会见了华裔美国人黄锦波医学博士。
    47岁的黄锦波博士曾两度担任美国舍瑞图市市长，三度当选市议员。应他的要求，李鹏着重向他介绍了中国党和政府制止动乱、平息暴乱的有关政策。
    李鹏说：“我们将严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。我们打击和惩处的是那些在幕前和幕后策划和指挥动乱和暴乱的人；是那些同国外反华势力相勾结，蓄谋颠覆我国社会主义制度的人；是那些进行打砸抢烧杀的人；特别是那些刑满释放、继续作恶的人。我们依法处理这些人，代表了中国人民的根本利益，是中国的内政。”
    李鹏说，中国党和政府多次讲过，对那些参加过游行示威、静坐、绝食，甚至有过过激言行的学生，尽管我们不赞成他们的做法，但只要他们没有触犯刑律，我们是会采取宽容政策的。但是我们希望他们认真反思，吸取教训。
    李鹏在谈到中国在国外的留学人员有过这样或那样的过激言行问题时指出，这是由于他们受了舆论的蒙蔽，不了解事实真相。李鹏相信当他们一旦了解了事实的真相，是会逐步改变看法的。他说，党和政府像过去一样，期待着他们学成回国，为祖国的四化建设贡献力量。
    李鹏说，国外有人对中国平息暴乱不理解，甚至指责，除了确有一些人存在偏见外，多数人是受了舆论的欺骗，加上对中国的国情很不了解。“我相信，这种情况是会逐步改变的。”
    李鹏最后指出：“中国是一个有11亿人口的国家。只要政局是稳定的，经济是发展的，党的领导核心是团结的，我们的国家就大有希望。”
    国务院侨办主任廖晖参加了会见。
    6月29日，吴学谦副总理曾会见了黄锦波博士，同他进行了友好的交谈。
