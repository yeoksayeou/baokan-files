The Japanese representative attending the dialogue meeting with South Pacific Forum member countries in Tarawa, the capital of the South Pacific island nation of Kiribati, stated yesterday that at least until next March, Japan will not consider reducing the size of its drift net fishing fleet.

According to local newspaper reports today, the Japanese representative said that the claim that Japan and Taiwan, if they continue to use drift nets in the South Pacific region, will destroy the region's tuna resources within two years is "highly exaggerated" and that the Japanese government finds it difficult to accept.

In a declaration issued on July 11, the South Pacific Forum nations called on Japan and Taiwan to immediately stop using drift nets in the South Pacific region to protect fishery resources. The Japanese representative's remarks indicate that Japan has not responded to this appeal.

The Japanese representative also stated that Japan will not expand its drift net fishing fleet, strengthen the management of fishing vessels and their operations, and further study the issue of whether drift net fishing will destroy tuna resources.

The Western industrialized countries participating in this dialogue with the South Pacific Forum nations, in addition to Japan, include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and France.

    日拒绝南太平洋论坛国家首脑会议呼吁
    将坚持在该海域漂网捕鱼
    新华社惠灵顿7月15日电  正在南太平洋岛国基里巴斯首都塔拉瓦参加与南太平洋论坛成员国对话会议的日本代表昨天表示，至少到明年3月为止，日本不会考虑缩小其漂网船队的规模。
    据此间报纸今天报道，日本代表说，关于日本和台湾如果继续在南太平洋地区使用漂网捕鱼在两年内毁坏该地区金枪鱼资源的说法，“非常夸张”，日本政府难以接受。
    南太平洋论坛国家首脑会议在7月11日发表的一份宣言中，呼吁日本、台湾立即停止在南太平洋地区使用漂网捕鱼，以保护渔业资源。日本代表的讲话表明，日本没有响应这一呼吁。
    日本代表又表示，日本将不再扩大漂网船队，加强对渔船及其作业情况的管理，并进一步研究漂网捕鱼是否会毁坏金枪鱼资源问题。
    这次参加与南太平洋论坛国家对话的西方主要工业国家除日本外，还有美国、加拿大、英国和法国。
