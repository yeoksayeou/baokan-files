The tax system in Jilin Province has increased transparency in tax collection, reducing instances of arbitrary taxation and penalties.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Changchun on July 23rd, since Jilin Province implemented open tax collection, instances of "personal favors" and arbitrary taxation and penalties have decreased.

Jilin Province Tax Bureau began implementing a limited scope of open tax collection in grassroots tax departments as early as 1986. Measures included public evaluation of individual business households' tax quotas, publicizing the disciplines that tax officials must adhere to, and publicly handling tax officials who violate regulations and laws. These measures were well-received by taxpayers. The bureau then implemented the "five open" system in all grassroots tax units across the province at the beginning of last year. This system includes open tax policies, open management, open tax exemptions, open disciplines, and open penalties.

Since the implementation of open tax collection across the province, the transparency of tax work in Jilin has significantly improved. Previously, some enterprises, due to a lack of understanding of tax exemption policies, often viewed tax exemptions approved by tax departments as personal favors from individual tax officials. As a result, there were frequent instances of enterprises thanking tax officials after receiving tax exemptions. Now, enterprises understand that these exemptions are decisions made by the collective leadership of the tax authorities and represent the state's support for the enterprises. This has greatly reduced the practice of entertaining and gifting in exchange for tax exemptions.

### 税务系统增加办税透明度  吉林乱征滥罚现象减少

    税务系统增加办税透明度
    吉林乱征滥罚现象减少
    据新华社长春7月23日电　（通讯员夏福才、记者张开欣）吉林省税务系统实行公开办税后，减少了“人情税”以及乱征滥罚现象。
    吉林省税务局早在1986年即在基层税务部门实行了一定范围的公开办税，如公开评议个体工商业户纳税定额、公开税务干部应遵守的纪律以及公开处理违纪违法税务干部。这样做，受到纳税人的欢迎。这个税务局于去年初在全省基层税务单位普遍实行了办税“五公开”制度，即税收政策公开、征管公开、减免税公开、纪律公开以及处罚公开。
    全省税务系统实行公开办税后，大大提高了全省税务工作的透明度。过去，有些企业由于不了解减免税政策，往往把税务部门批准的减免税看成是某个税务干部的个人照顾，事后答谢税务干部的现象常有发生。现在企业清楚了这是由税务机关领导集体决定的，是国家对企业的照顾，从而大大减少了在减免税方面请客送礼的不正之风。
