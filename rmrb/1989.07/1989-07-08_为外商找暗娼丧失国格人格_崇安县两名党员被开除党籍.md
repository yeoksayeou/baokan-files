    Two Communist Party members from Chong'an County in Fujian Province, who adhered to the principle of "as long as money can be made, anything can be done," were recently expelled from the Party for introducing prostitutes to foreign businessmen during foreign economic activities. Other related individuals also received disciplinary actions.

    Last November, the Chong'an County Old Revolutionary Base Economic Development Company, while negotiating business with foreign businessmen, accommodated the foreign businessmen's request for female companionship for the night. Under the persuasion of Li Yuming, a hired employee of the company and a Communist Party member (whose organizational relationship is in Pucheng), the company's deputy manager, Fan Zhilian (a non-Party member), arranged for two Communist Party members, Li Xiangren (a worker at the Chongcheng Town Economic Liaison Commission) and Zhou Youyuan (a driver at the county truck fleet), to search for prostitutes with the help of Zhang Shuilong, a Communist Party member who runs a hotel, and others. Some people in the company believed that as long as the deal could be made, anything was acceptable. They disregarded shame and worked tirelessly, finally finding a prostitute and a vagrant woman to accompany the foreign businessmen for the night.

    When Pan Qingjun, the director of the county's Old Revolutionary Base Office, learned of the incident, he tried to persuade them but did not firmly stop it. The office director, Qiu Bingyou, who was on duty at the hotel, initially refused the request to find women, but when the two women were brought into the hotel to accompany the foreign businessmen, he did not stop them. It was only the next day that he reported the incident.

    To uphold Party discipline, the Chong'an County Committee and the County Discipline Inspection Commission decided to give Pan Qingjun a two-year probationary period within the Party and recommended that he be removed from his position as director of the county's Old Revolutionary Base Office. Li Xiangren and Zhang Shuilong were expelled from the Party; Zhou Youyuan was given a one-year probationary period within the Party; Qiu Bingyou received a Party internal criticism; it was recommended that Fan Zhilian be removed from his position as deputy manager of the Chong'an County Old Revolutionary Base Economic Development Company and that his on-the-job substitute salary be canceled; it was recommended that the Pucheng County Party organization expel Li Yuming from the Party.

    为外商找暗娼丧失国格人格  崇安县两名党员被开除党籍
    本报福州电　记者张铭清报道：奉行“只要能赚钱，什么事都可以干”的福建省崇安县两个共产党员，在涉外经济活动中为外商介绍暗娼陪宿，最近被开除党籍。其他有关人员也分别受到党纪处分。
    去年11月，崇安县老区经济开发公司在与外商洽谈业务时，迎合外商提出的要女人陪宿的要求，在公司聘用干部、共产党员李裕明（组织关系在浦城）的劝说下，公司副经理范志联（非党员）安排两个共产党员李祥仁（崇城镇经联委职工）、周有元（县货车队驾驶员），通过开旅社的共产党员张水龙等人，连夜出动四处寻找暗娼。公司的某些人认为，只要能做成生意就行。他们不顾廉耻，卖力奔波，终于找到一个暗娼和一个外流女人，供外商陪宿。
    县老区办主任潘庆军得知此事后，虽有劝说，但没有坚决阻止。在宾馆值班的办公室主任邱炳友虽拒绝过要他找女人的要求，但当两个女人被带进宾馆陪宿时，阻止不力，直到第二天才报告。
    为严肃党纪，崇安县委、县纪委决定，给予潘庆军留党察看二年的处分，并建议行政上撤销其县老区办主任职务。开除李祥仁、张水龙的党籍；给予周有元留党察看一年处分；给予邱炳友党内通报批评；建议行政上撤销范志联县老区经济开发公司副经理职务，取消其以工代干待遇；建议浦城县党组织开除李裕明的党籍。
