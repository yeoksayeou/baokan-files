People refer to Changzhou Dongfang Dyeing Factory as the "Eastern Tweed King." It has an annual production capacity of over 100 million meters, making it a renowned enterprise in China's textile industry.

This factory is located in the ancient city of Changzhou. It is situated to the east of Lake Tai, north of the Yangtze River, and west of Maoshan. The ancient Grand Canal flows gently by its side. The factory was established in 1944. The older generation knows that in old China, there was a dyeing factory called Changzhou Yifengchang, which was its predecessor.

Tweed is not very popular in China, but it is extremely fashionable abroad, becoming one of the most trendy high-end textiles. It has vibrant colors, clear patterns, a thick texture, and is comfortable to wear. Whether it is a Parisian woman or a British gentleman, wearing a piece of Chinese Eastern tweed makes them very happy. It is precisely by catering to the psychology of Westerners that Changzhou Dongfang Dyeing Factory, under the guidance of the policy of opening up to the outside world and reforming internally, has inherited the traditional technology of the older generation and absorbed advanced foreign technology, continuously creating new varieties.

Here, there is tweed with a strong nap, three-dimensional tweed, flame-retardant tweed, and vibrant printed tweed... The variety is dazzling. It is reported that the factory produces over 50 varieties and more than 3,000 color numbers of tweed. Among them, "Shuiyue" brand colored yarn tweed and "Lion King" brand polyester-cotton tweed are national silver award products. "Minle" brand mixed yarn tweed and mixed yarn half-tweed are high-quality products of the Ministry of Textile Industry. "Hailong" brand mixed yarn tweed is a high-quality product of Jiangsu Province... These high-quality tweeds are not only popular in the domestic market but are also in high demand in more than 80 countries and regions, including the United States, Canada, Japan, and Australia. Last year, exports reached 50.46 million meters, earning 40.25 million US dollars, making it the top exporter and foreign exchange earner in the country for similar products.

Many foreign businessmen love the tweed from Dongfang Dyeing Factory. After visiting the factory, French dyeing expert Du Tel said, "I think it has reached the level of a 'champion,' no matter where in the world." Once, a foreign businessman wanted to process 1.2 million meters of military green tweed. At that time, he only brought a bag of soil from his country as a color sample. The factory adjusted the color according to the soil brought by the foreign businessman, adjusting several dozen formulas and changing the process more than 10 times in half a month, quickly producing the military green tweed he needed and was satisfied with. When picking up the goods, the foreign businessman repeatedly expressed his admiration for Dongfang Factory's quality and timely delivery. The following year, he came back to the factory to order another 2 million meters.

To further expand production and improve quality, the factory used the earned foreign exchange to purchase pre-shrinking machines and heat-setting machines from the Federal Republic of Germany, enhancing its pre- and post-processing capabilities. It also used loans to introduce a synthetic fiber production line, building the factory, installing equipment, and starting production all in the same year, recovering the entire investment. The factory also added equipment for printing varieties, forming a printing production line, renovated the 180-centimeter wide dyeing production line, built a 4,500-kilowatt waste heat power generation unit and a relatively advanced sewage treatment plant with a daily processing capacity of 5,000 tons, as well as a river water purification device with a capacity of 500 tons per hour, etc., ensuring that production is not affected by water, electricity, gas, and environmental conditions. Technological transformation has made this 45-year-old factory full of youthful vigor.

In recent years, international market competition has become increasingly fierce. To enhance the competitiveness of its products, Changzhou Dongfang Dyeing Factory has actively developed horizontal alliances, gradually forming a group advantage. In April 1985, a "Dongfang Shuiyue Textile Dyeing Tweed Export Group (Company)" was established with the factory as the main body. Now, 22 textile and dyeing enterprises, research institutions, and universities from all over the country have become members of the group, forming an optimal combination of production factors among the member units, and continuously expanding production capacity. The group has also carried out multi-port operations. By next year, the group's foreign exchange earnings will reach 80 million US dollars. Dongfang Dyeing Factory, a "tweed king" with competitive and adaptive capabilities, will truly appear in the East!

    东方咔叽王
    ——记常州东方印染厂
    匡启健　刘燮阳
    人们把常州东方印染厂称为“东方咔叽王”，拥有年产1亿米以上的能力，是中国纺织行业的著名企业。
    这座工厂坐落在古城常州。它东濒太湖，北靠长江，西倚茅山，京杭古运河从它身边轻轻流过。工厂创建于1944年，老一代的人都知道，旧中国有个常州益丰昌染厂，就是它的前身。
    咔叽，在中国并不时兴，而在国外却风靡一时，成为最时髦的一种高档纺织品。它色泽鲜艳，纹路清晰，手感厚实，穿着舒适，无论是法国的巴黎女郎，还是英国的绅士，只要能穿上一件中国的东方咔叽，感到十分高兴。正是迎合西方人的心理，常州东方印染厂这几年在对外搞开放，对内搞活的方针指引下，继承老一代的传统技术，并吸收国外的先进技术，不断创造新品种。
    这里有毛感很强的磨毛咔叽，富有立体感的起花咔叽，能防火的阻燃咔叽，色泽艳丽的印花咔叽……琳琅满目。据介绍，这个厂生产的咔叽已有50多个品种3000多种色号。其中“水月”牌色纱咔、“狮王”牌涤棉咔叽是国家银质奖产品，“民乐”牌杂色纱咔和杂色半咔是纺工部优质产品，“海狮”牌杂色纱咔是江苏省优质产品……这些优质咔叽，目前除在国内畅销不衰外，在美国、加拿大、日本、澳大利亚等80多个国家和地区也是抢手货。去年出口达到5046万米，创汇4025万美元，在全国同类产品中出口量和创汇量均为第一。
    许多外商喜爱东方印染厂的咔叽，法国印染专家杜特尔参观该厂后说：“我认为已达到‘冠军’的地步，不管在世界任何地方来说都是这样。”有一次，一个外商要加工120万米的军绿咔叽，当时他只带来了该国的一袋泥土作为色样，厂里照这个外商带来的泥土的颜色，用半个月时间，调整了几十只配方，更改了10多次工艺，很快生产出了他需要和满意的军绿咔叽。在提货时，外商对东方厂保质保量提前履约连连表示敬佩。第二年他又来该厂订购200万米。
    为了进一步扩大生产，提高质量，工厂通过创收的外汇，添置了从联邦德国进口的预缩机和热定型机，增强了前、后处理的能力，还利用贷款引进了一条化纤流水线，当年建厂房，当年安装，当年投产并收回了全部投资。工厂还增加了印花品种的设备，形成了印花生产线，改造了180厘米辊幅的阔幅漂染生产线，新建了4500千瓦余热发电机组和较先进的日处理为5000吨的污水处理站，以及每小时500吨的河水净化设备等等，使生产不致因水、电、汽和环境条件的制约而受影响。技术改造使这个具有45年历史的老厂充满了青春的活力。
    这些年来，国际市场竞争日趋激烈，为了提高产品竞争力，常州东方印染厂积极发展横向联合，逐步形成了群体优势。1985年4月，以该厂为主体组建了“东方水月纺织印染咔叽出口集团（公司）”。现在，全国各地已有22家纺织、印染企业和科研机构、高等院校成为该集团的成员，形成了各成员单位之间生产要素的优化组合，生产能力不断扩大。集团还开展了多口岸的工作。到明年集团创汇将达8000万美元。东方印染厂，一个有竞争能力和应变能力的“咔叽王”，将名副其实地出现在世界的东方！
