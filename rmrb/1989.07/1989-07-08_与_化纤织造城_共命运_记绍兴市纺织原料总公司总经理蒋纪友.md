If there is a "Synthetic Fiber Textile City," it is Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province. In one year, it produces over 400 million meters of synthetic fiber fabric. In 1988 alone, the polyester yarn consumed by the production of synthetic fiber fabric accounted for one-third of the national demand.

The main force behind this "Synthetic Fiber Textile City" is the township enterprises that have risen rapidly with the rural economic reforms. In the process of their development and growth, almost all of these enterprises have had a crucial figure—Jiang Jiyou.

Jiang Jiyou is the general manager of the Shaoxing Textile Raw Materials Company. His fate is closely tied to synthetic fiber textiles.

One day last year, the manager of a township silk weaving factory rushed to see Jiang Jiyou.

"Manager Jiang, we've run out of supplies. Please help us out..." The manager's bloodshot eyes pleaded.

It turned out that the factory was facing a double crisis: tight credit had led to a shortage of working capital, and the market was short of raw materials, making it difficult to buy even at high prices. As a result, the entire factory was in a state of panic. Jiang Jiyou listened to the manager's plea and felt heavy-hearted. This general manager, who had served in the army for 11 years, paced back and forth before decisively saying, "Your difficulties are our difficulties. I'll send someone to find a solution right away!"

That day, Jiang Jiyou selected a few capable businessmen to set out. Soon, a train car full of polyester yarn arrived at the silk weaving factory. The machines, which had been idle for days, started humming again, and the workers' faces lit up with smiles.

This deal brought no economic benefit to the company. But Jiang Jiyou felt no sense of loss. From the first day he took office as general manager, he clearly told the employees: the company pursues a combination of economic benefits and social benefits; the purpose of running the company is to be the "logistics department" for township enterprises; the company must tie its fate to that of the production enterprises. Even at the height of the "money-first" trend, they never forgot their responsibilities.

This year, Shaoxing's textile industry, like many other regions in the country, is not doing well. Nearly 2,000 township enterprises engaged in light textile production in the city are facing unprecedented challenges. Jiang Jiyou deeply feels the weight of his responsibilities. He knows what it would mean for Shaoxing's economy if these enterprises collapse. Therefore, under the premise of complying with the state's industrial structure policy, Jiang Jiyou proposed a "three-preference policy" to protect township enterprises: "preference" (priority supply of raw materials to enterprises with greater difficulties), "preferential" (preferential supply for new product development), and "preferential support" (advance payment, deferred settlement), to support the development of advantageous enterprises.

One township enterprise, in order to develop a new product called "tree bark wrinkle," came to see Jiang Jiyou, hoping to quickly obtain a new type of raw material.

Jiang Jiyou agreed immediately and dispatched businessmen to collect information across the country. He himself, like a "hawk," kept a keen eye on the domestic and international markets.

Soon, Jiang Jiyou delivered a new type of raw material called "polyester stretch yarn" to the textile factory.

The factory was overjoyed. The "tree bark wrinkle" fabric produced from this raw material had more advantages than the "tree bark wrinkle" produced by other factories using polyester yarn as the raw material.

Jiang Jiyou became famous, naturally attracting people who wanted to curry favor.

One evening after work, a man on a bicycle approached him. "Manager Jiang, I've been waiting for you here for three days!" The man got off his bike and smiled, "The package here has two pounds of daylilies, sent by our factory director."

"Daylilies? Let me see!" Jiang Jiyou took the package and started to open it.

"Don't open it now... There's an envelope inside with..." Before the man could finish, Jiang Jiyou's face changed color: "I don't want the things. Go back and tell your factory director that if you really need raw materials, I'll provide them; but if you want to do something not quite right, you won't get a single thread!"

The man stood there, staring at Jiang Jiyou's retreating figure.

Old Jiang said, it's not easy for an enterprise to successfully shape its image, and it's even more difficult to manage an enterprise. However, as long as we take practical actions that stand the test of time, we can definitely change the public's perception of enterprise management.

    与“化纤织造城”共命运
    ——记绍兴市纺织原料总公司总经理蒋纪友
    邹建中　董建华
    如果说有座“化纤织造城”，它就是浙江省绍兴市。一年，它产化纤布4亿多米，仅1988年生产化纤布消耗的涤纶丝就占全国需求量的1／3。
    这座“化纤织造城”的主力军便是随着农村经济改革而异军突起的乡镇企业。而这些企业在发展壮大的过程中，几乎都少不了一个至关重要的人物——蒋纪友。
    蒋纪友，市纺织原料总公司总经理。他的命运几乎是和化纤织造紧密相联的。
    去年的一天，有家乡办丝织厂厂长匆匆来找蒋纪友。
    “蒋总，我们断顿了，拉一把吧……”厂长布满血丝的眼睛露出了乞求之光。
    原来，这家厂面临着双重困境：银根抽紧后，流动资金短缺；市场上原料供不应求，用高价也难以买到。为此，全厂上下急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。蒋纪友听完厂长的“诉说”，心情十分沉重。这位当过11年兵的总经理来回走了几步后果断地说：“你们的困难，就是我们的困难，我马上派人去想办法！”
    当天，蒋纪友挑选精明能干的业务员出发了。没多久，一车皮涤纶丝运到了那家丝织厂。停了多日的织机重又唱起了欢歌，工人们脸上露出了笑容。
    这笔生意，对公司来说，经济效益等于零。但蒋纪友竟无吃亏之感。他从当总经理的第一天起就明确告诉职工：公司追求的是经济效益和社会效益的结合；办公司，宗旨是当好乡镇企业的“后勤部”；公司必须把自己的命运和生产厂家的命运绑在一起。即使在“金钱至上”之风最盛行时，他们也始终未忘自己的职责。
    今年，绍兴的纺织行业和全国一些地区的同行一样不太景气。全市近2000家从事轻纺织造的乡镇企业面临着前所未有的严峻挑战。蒋纪友深感肩头的责任重大。他深知，这些企业一旦垮下，对绍兴的经济将意味着什么？为此，在符合国家产业结构政策的前提下，蒋纪友提出了保护乡镇企业的“三优政策”，即“优先”（企业困难较大的优先供应原料）、“优惠”（只要是用于新产品开发的优惠供应）、“优扶”（先提货，后付款），以此来扶植优势企业的发展。
    有一家乡镇企业，为了开发一种叫“树皮皱”的新产品，来找老蒋，希望尽快提供一种新型原料。
    蒋纪友一口答应，立即派出业务员到全国各地去收集信息，他本人也像一只“猎鹰”，警觉地注意着国内外市场。
    没过多久，蒋纪友便把一种叫“多元脂伸缩丝”的新型原料送到了这家纺织厂。
    厂家欣喜不已。这种原料生产出的“树皮皱”织物比其他厂家用涤纶丝作原料的“树皮皱”具有更多的优点。
    蒋纪友名气大了，自然有人来“讨好巴结”。
    一次下班回家，一个骑自行车的人迎了上来。“蒋总经理，我在这里等了您3天！”那人下了车，笑嘻嘻地说，“这包里有两斤黄花菜，是我们厂长让我送给你的。”
    “黄花菜？我看看！”蒋纪友接过包就要翻。
    “现在别翻……里面还有一信封，有……”
    还没等那人说完，蒋纪友就变了脸色：“东西我不要。回去告诉你们厂长，真需要原料，我给；如想弄点去搞不光明正大的事，一两丝也没有！”
    那人愣愣地看着蒋纪友远去的背影。
    老蒋说，一个企业要成功地塑造自己很不容易，经营企业就更加困难。但是只要我们拿出过得硬的实际行动，就一定能够改变经营企业在公众中的形象。
