    Treat Farmers with Sincerity
    Meng Qingqian

    “The procurement of summer grain is difficult to say, but it is also not difficult. The key is how to treat farmers.” This is the experience of Lu Xiumin, the Party Secretary of Lingyang Township in Juxian County, Shandong Province.

    It is known that Lingyang Township's annual summer grain procurement quota is over 2 million kilograms, making it one of the largest grain-procuring townships in Juxian County. In 1987, it took 9 days to complete the quota, and last year it took only 5 days, both in terms of speed and quantity, leading the county.

    During the wheat harvest season, the author interviewed the township's Party Secretary.

    Regarding the contract procurement, he said: “This issue, if neglected, can easily become a one-sided grain collection notice. In the past two years, we have paid special attention to this point. Every time grain and oil are procured, instead of standing high and shouting or pressing hard, we organize propaganda on the Economic Contract Law, explain to farmers the seriousness of fulfilling contracts, and guide them to establish a sense of contribution. The township publicly commends and rewards more than 4,000 farmers who deliver good and more grain, creating an atmosphere of honor for those who deliver more. The facts have proven that as long as the work is done well, farmers are reasonable.”

    This Party Secretary also talked about the issue of exchanging hearts. He said: “Farmers work hard to grow a little grain, which is really not easy. During cultivation, weeding, and management, you don't care or ask, but when it comes to grain collection, you come to urge, and naturally, they have their opinions. In the past two years, we usually divide the cadres into each village to specifically help farmers solve problems related to pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation, and good seeds. When farmers have a good harvest, they naturally remember the benefits given by the state and the help from the cadres, and naturally think of delivering more and better grain.”

    “In the past, farmers had to push carts and carry poles in line at the grain management office. Those close to the township were fine, but those far away had to wait overnight. In the past two years, we have changed this grain collection method. Every time, the township spends money to rent nearly 300 tractors from the entire township and goes to the villages to procure. Farmers see that the cadres are in their hearts, and they are more enthusiastic about delivering grain.”

    “There is also the issue of linking and fulfilling contracts.” This Party Secretary said: “Sometimes the state cannot fully supply fertilizers and diesel. Regarding this, we educate and guide farmers to understand the state's difficulties, not to quibble, but to establish a sense of the overall situation and share the country's worries together. For the part of the contracted materials that is lacking, the township does its best to make up the difference. In the past two years, we have organized the supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural service stations to purchase planned fertilizers and diesel from outside the province in advance each year.

    拿出真心待农民
    孟庆谦
    “夏粮收购说难很难，说不难也不难，关键是怎样对待农民。”这是山东省莒县陵阳乡党委书记卢绪敏的体会。
    据悉，陵阳乡每年夏粮定购任务在200万公斤以上，称得上是莒县的交粮大户。这么大的数量，1987年用了9天，去年仅用了5天就完成了，无论是速度还是数量均在全县前茅。
    麦收时节，笔者采访了这个乡的党委书记。
    关于合同定购，他说：“这个问题一疏忽，很容易成了单方面的催粮通知书。这两年，我们特别注意了这点，每到收购粮油，不是站在高处空喊硬压，而是组织宣传经济合同法，向农民阐明履行合同的严肃性，还引导他们树立一种奉献精神。乡里对4000多个交好粮、多交粮的农户，大张旗鼓地进行表彰奖励，形成一种多交光荣的气氛。事实证明，只要工作到家、农民是通情达理的。”
    这位党委书记还谈了以心换心问题，他说：“农民种点粮食辛辛苦苦，实在不易。耕种锄管时您不管不问，收粮了你来催，他自然有看法。近两年，我们平常都是把干部分包到每个村，具体帮助农民解决农药、化肥、浇水、良种等一系列问题，农民丰收了，自然忘不了国家给的好处和干部的帮助，自然而然想到多交粮交好粮。”
    “过去农民交粮，要推车挑担在粮管所门前排队，距乡近的好说，远的挨不上号还要过夜。近两年，我们改变了这种收粮方式，每到这时，乡里出钱把全乡近300台拖拉机租来，开到村里收购。农民见干部与他们一条心，交粮更有积极性了。”
    “还有挂钩兑现问题。”这位党委书记说：“化肥、柴油国家有时不能一次兑付。对此，我们教育引导农民理解国家的难处，不要斤斤计较、要树立全局观念，共同为国分忧。对于兑现物资欠缺部分，乡里尽最大努力进行补差。近两年，我们每年事先组织供销社和农经服务站，到外地购进计划外化肥、柴油。
