Strengthening Ideological Education for Middle School Students

Recently, we conducted a survey on the ideological state of over 400 middle school students in several schools across the county. We also held discussions with dozens of school leaders, teachers, and students. We found that the ideological education work in some middle schools is quite weak and urgently needs improvement and strengthening.

The surveyed 400 middle school students have broad interests, active thoughts, and a keen concern for national affairs. They understand reform, with 94% of the students having a good grasp of domestic and international events. They abhor evil and have a strong sense of justice. In the section "What do you hate most in society?", 58.3% of the students wrote "hate corrupt party officials," and 28.7% wrote "poor social order." Many students aspire to become fair judges to severely punish social miscreants. However, many of the students' responses are thought-provoking and worrying.

First, some students are experiencing a crisis of faith. Among the surveyed students, 55.8% have no faith, 42.9% believe in Marxism-Leninism, and 1.3% believe in religion. Many students say, "The purpose of studying politics is to get into college." 52% of the students find political classes "uninteresting" or think they are "deceiving people."

Second, there is a lack of lofty ideals. During the discussions, some students talked about their plans after graduation: some rural students said, "to get a government job"; some urban students said, "to graduate and find a job"; some simply replied, "haven't thought about it." Teachers reflected that a considerable number of high school students feel they have seen through the world, thinking there is nothing to strive for, and their spirits are waning before their time.

Third, early romantic relationships are increasing. Among the surveyed students, 91.4% said, "there are students dating in our school and class"; 45.5% of the students think "dating is acceptable." Teachers said that students who are in relationships do not strive for academic progress, do not seek political progress, have poor discipline, and disrupt the normal order of the school.

The causes of this situation include the influence of various erroneous ideologies and unhealthy publications in society, which have led to some confusion and unclear right and wrong among students. Additionally, there are the following main reasons:

School ideological and political education work has been relaxed. In recent years, school leaders have been busy with teaching work and have paid less attention to ideological education. Schools only emphasize producing talents quickly, neglecting the question of what kind of talents to produce. Moreover, now there is too little common language between teachers and students, making it difficult for them to understand each other, resulting in a disconnect between ideological education and students' actual thoughts. Teachers complain: "Ideological work is hard to do now. Old methods don't work, and new methods don't either. Political ideological work always misses the mark."

The negative influence of social trends. In recent years, corruption within the party and unhealthy trends in society have gradually seeped into schools. 38.4% of the students believe that phenomena such as pulling strings and using connections in recruitment have a very bad influence on students. Some students also learn to tell lies, such as when some senior high school students fill out registration forms, some classes have as many as 20 "class monitors" and "branch secretaries."

Lack of family education. Some parents, despite wanting to educate their children well, often achieve little due to improper methods. Some parents, eager for their children to succeed, frequently scold and beat them, causing the children to develop opposing attitudes. Some parents living in rural areas think that once their children enter middle school, their knowledge level is higher than theirs, so they no longer pay attention to educating their children on how to be a good person. Some parents lack social ethics, fearing that their children will be taken advantage of outside, and often instill harmful ideas of harming others for personal gain.

So, how can we strengthen and improve ideological education in middle schools?

We believe that local leaders, school teachers, and student parents should work together. Use diverse and rich forms to strengthen ideological and political work within the school; at the same time, take effective measures to create a good social environment for the healthy growth of children.

### 加强对中学生的思想教育工作

    加强对中学生的思想教育工作
    最近，我们在全县部分中学400多名中学生中，作了一次思想状况问卷调查，并找学校领导、教师、学生数十人进行了座谈，发现目前一些中学的思想教育工作非常薄弱，亟待改进和加强。
    被调查的400名中学生兴趣广泛，思想活跃，关心国事，理解改革，94％的学生对国内外时事把握准确。他们嫉恶如仇，正义感强，在“您对社会上最痛恨的现象”的选择栏中，58.3％的学生填写“痛恨党风不正”，28.7％的学生填写社会治安太差。许多学生的理想是当一名公正法官，严惩社会败类。但是，许多学生的回答发人深思，令人担忧。
    一是一些学生存在信仰危机。被调查的学生中，没有信仰的学生占55.8％，信仰马列主义的占42.9％，信仰宗教的占1.3％。许多学生说：“学习政治的目的是为了升学。”52％的学生对政治课“不感兴趣”或觉得是“糊弄人”。
    二是缺乏远大理想。座谈中一些学生谈了毕业后的打算：有些农村学生说，“吃上国库粮”；有些城镇学生说，“混到毕业，找个工作了事”；有的干脆回答说，“没考虑”。老师们反映，有相当一部分高中学生认为自己看破了“红尘”，觉得没啥奔头，人未老，志先衰。
    三是早恋现象增多。被调查的学生中，91.4％的学生说，“本校和本班内有谈恋爱的”；45.5％的学生认为恋爱“可以谈”。老师们说，谈恋爱的学生学业上不求进取，政治上不求进步，纪律涣散，影响了学校的正常秩序。
    造成这种状况，有一个重要原因，是社会上各种错误思潮的影响，各种不健康书刊的影响，使学生中出现了某些思想混乱，是非不清的现象。此外，还有如下主要原因：
    学校思想政治教育工作放松了。这些年，学校领导忙教学工作多，抓思想教育少。学校只强调多出人才，快出人才，忽视了出什么样人才的问题。另外，现在教师和学生之间共同语言太少，不能相互理解，造成思想教育和学生的实际思想相脱离的现象。老师抱怨：“现在的学生思想工作难做，老办法不管用，新办法不顶用，政治思想工作总做不到点子上。”
    社会风气的消极影响。近年来，党内出现的腐败现象和社会上的不正之风已逐渐渗透到学校。38.4％的学生认为，招工招干中出现的拉关系、走后门等现象，在学生中造成极坏影响。有的学生也学着说假话，如有些高三学生填写考生登记表时，有的班级竟出现20多个“班长”、“团支书”。
    家庭教育落后。一些家长尽管想教育好孩子，但由于方法不当，往往事倍功半。有的家长望子成龙心切，动辄训斥打骂，使孩子产生对立情绪。有的生活在农村的家长认为孩子考上了中学，知识水平比自己高，也就不再注意教育孩子如何做人。有的家长缺乏社会公德，生怕孩子在外吃亏，竟经常向孩子灌输一些损人利己的思想。
    那么，如何加强和改进中学的思想教育工作呢？
    我们认为：地方领导、学校教师、学生家长要互相配合。采用丰富多采的形式，加强学校内部的思想政治工作；与此同时，还应采取有力措施，为孩子们的健康成长创造良好的社会环境。
