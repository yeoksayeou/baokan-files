The State Council Office recently forwarded the Ministry of Civil Affairs' report on further deepening civil affairs work reform and fully playing the role of stabilizing mechanisms in a notice. The notice requires that all provincial, autonomous region, and municipal governments, as well as various departments and agencies under the State Council, refer to and implement the report.

The Ministry of Civil Affairs' report summarizes the basic situation of civil affairs work over the past five years and outlines the central tasks for civil affairs departments at all levels over the next five years: using the basic line of the Party in the primary stage of socialism as a guide, deepening reforms, consolidating achievements, strengthening self-construction, fully playing the role of stabilizing mechanisms, and striving to work for socialist modernization.

The report points out that the main problems that need to be addressed in current civil affairs work are:

	(1) The relationship in the construction of grassroots political power has not been fully straightened out. In some regions, the daily work of constructing grassroots political power in urban and rural areas has not been handed over to the civil affairs departments, while in other regions, although tasks have been assigned, corresponding personnel have not been allocated. It is hoped that all levels of government will pay high attention to this and help solve some practical problems.

	(2) The allocation of grassroots civil affairs cadres does not match the tasks. It is hoped that various places will seriously address this issue as local institutions and cadre systems are reformed.

	(3) Insufficient funds. Over the past few years, all levels of government have paid great attention to the development of civil affairs, and various funds have increased to different degrees. However, due to price increases, the original standards have become relatively low, especially for the living conditions of social relief recipients, which are quite difficult. Some welfare and relief institutions have old and dilapidated buildings and outdated equipment. In addition, due to increased tasks such as association registration, place name management, grassroots political power construction, and border dispute mediation, business funds have not been secured. It is hoped that according to the current fiscal system, funds under central management will be arranged by the central budget, and funds under local management will be resolved by the local governments.

    国办转发民政部报告
    民政改革应进一步深化
    新华社北京7月21日电  国务院办公厅最近在转发民政部关于进一步深化民政工作改革充分发挥稳定机制作用报告的通知中，要求各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府，国务院各部委、各直属机构参照执行。
    民政部的这个报告总结了过去五年民政工作的基本情况，提出了今后五年各级民政部门的中心任务：以党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线为指针，深化改革，巩固成果，加强自身建设，充分发挥稳定机制作用，为社会主义现代化建设努力工作。
    报告指出，当前民政工作亟待解决的问题主要有：
      （一）基层政权建设的关系没有完全理顺。有的地区没有把城乡基层政权建设的日常工作交给民政部门，有的地区交了任务但没有相应配备人员。希望各级政府给予高度重视，并切实帮助解决一些实际问题。
      （二）基层民政干部配备与任务不相适应。希望各地随着地方机构和干部制度的改革认真加以解决。
      （三）经费不足。几年来，各级政府对民政事业的发展是十分重视的，各项经费均有不同程度的增长。但由于物价上涨，原有标准就相对偏低了，尤其是社会救济对象生活相当困难，有些优抚、救济事业单位房屋年久失修，设备陈旧。此外，由于任务增加，如社团登记、地名管理、基层政权建设、边界调处等工作，业务经费也没有落实。希望按照现行财政体制，属于中央管的，由中央预算予以安排；属于地方管的，请各级政府予以解决。
