    Always Fresh and Full of Life—A Sketch of Dancer Li Xiaoyun
    Ling Yaozhong

    The heavens often bestow peculiarities upon artists, which then become topics of curiosity for the world. One such peculiarity of Li Xiaoyun, a first-class choreographer at the Shanghai Dance Troupe, is her unique speaking speed. Once you have the fortune to converse with her, if the conversation happens to be engaging, you will immediately feel that you have been deprived of the chance to speak.

    Li Xiaoyun is also a dancer who cherishes tranquility and is inclined towards daydreaming. She spent her childhood and youth in a small town near Dalian in the 1940s, where traditional Chinese folk arts enriched her imagination. For example, her hometown's dragon dances, stilts, temple performances, and lantern dances, especially the vibrant and colorful vitality of folk dances, deeply moved her. After entering the Beijing Dance Academy, fate shaped her according to a set of standardized dance languages. She danced in "The Four Swans," "Ordos," and was particularly captivated by "Romeo and Juliet," which gave her wings to soar.

    In the eyes of the public, choreographers are always linked with their works, which is a scientific way of association. Li Xiaoyun's choreographed dances "High Mountains and Flowing Waters" and "Fishing Boat at Dusk" are two fresh doses of color injected into the audience's vision. These two works won first prizes in two consecutive East China Dance Competitions, thereby gradually establishing her new vision in the field of dance expression. For a considerable period, she read poetry, traveled extensively, and sought the aesthetic trajectory of contemporary dance transformation. In Nanxian, she was amazed by the exquisite and layered scenery, which reminded her of the techniques of Chinese ink painting. She lamented the poverty of dance forms and saw an old man in the rain, wearing a raincoat and fishing alone by the river, which inspired the dance imagery of "Fishing Boat at Dusk." Li Xiaoyun rejects the utilitarianism in dance creation and advocates for dance to return to nature, be close to nature, and express nature. In her artistic vision, she is more inclined towards a delicate and free dance expression style, pursuing simplicity and authenticity, and calling for an artistic realm. Li Xiaoyun has had many achievements, such as "Long March Suite," "Heroic Sisters of the Grasslands," "Thunder in the Miao Mountains," "Rose," "Ten Faces Buried," and "Golden Dance, Silver Ornaments." In recent years, Li Xiaoyun has paid more attention to the aesthetic changes in contemporary dance. Her collaboration with five other choreographers in the large-scale dance costume exhibition "Golden Dance, Silver Ornaments" showcased the five-thousand-year-old clothing culture of ancient China, a dance peripheral product rich in cultural connotations. "Golden Dance, Silver Ornaments" has attracted widespread attention from the domestic and international art circles.

    总有新鲜道风流
    ——舞蹈家李晓筠剪影
    凌耀忠
    上苍赋于艺术家许多怪癖并转移给好奇的世人们以作谈资，这已不算新闻。上海舞剧院的一级编导李晓筠一项奇癖，就是她那种独到的语速。一俟你有幸与她对话，倘若这对话又多少显得投机，你马上会觉得自己被剥夺了可能发言的机会。
    李晓筠也是一位崇尚宁静、偏于遐想的舞蹈家。在四十年代大连附近的一个小城镇渡过了童年少年生涯，中国民间的传统艺术从小给予她丰富的想象，比如家乡的秧歌、高跷、庙戏、灯舞，其中民间舞蹈的那种蓬勃斑斓的原始生命力使得她一往情深。当她考入北京舞蹈学校后，命运之神便按照一整套规范的舞蹈语言去塑造她。她跳过《四小天鹅》、《鄂尔多斯》，极其迷恋《罗密欧》，使她插上腾飞的翅膀。
    在公众的眼里，总把编导家和他的作品联系在一起，这是一种科学的联系法。李晓筠创作的舞蹈《高山流水》、《渔舟唱晚》，是注入观众视听的两剂新鲜的颜料，这两部作品在两届华东舞蹈比赛中都荣膺一等奖，由此也使得她逐步建构了在舞蹈表现领域里的一种新的设想。在相当一个时期内，她读诗吟赋，寄情山水，旅游四方，发古之幽情，寻当代舞蹈嬗变的审美轨迹。在南雁荡山，她惊羡于景色的绮丽而又极富层次感，联想到国画的表现手法，感叹舞蹈造型的贫乏，她看见雨中老翁，身披蓑衣，临江独钓，由此生发出《渔舟唱晚》的舞蹈意境。李晓筠厌弃舞蹈创作上单纯的、应时的艺术功利主义，主张舞蹈回归自然，贴近自然，表现自然。在她的艺术观方面，更移情于纤柔写意的舞蹈表现风格，追求返朴归真，呼唤一种艺术境界。李晓筠收获颇丰，如：《长征组舞》、《草原英雄小姐妹》、《苗岭风雷》、《玫瑰》、《十面埋伏》、《金舞银饰》等。李晓筠近年更注目于当代舞蹈的审美流变，她与其他五位编导合作的大型舞蹈服饰展演《金舞银饰》，一展中华古国五千年的衣冠文化，是一种饱含文化内涵的舞蹈边缘品种，《金舞银饰》引起中外艺术界的广泛重视。
