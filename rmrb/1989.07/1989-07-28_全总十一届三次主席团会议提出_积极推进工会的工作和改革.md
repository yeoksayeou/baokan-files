Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 28th.

The third plenary session (enlarged) of the 11th All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) concluded today. During the session, representatives focused on the four major tasks set by the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, concentrating their efforts on significant issues and maintaining a broad perspective. They reached a consensus on major issues. The session proposed to strive to implement the thought of wholeheartedly relying on the working class and actively promote trade union work and reform.

The session fully affirmed the role of the working class in stabilizing the situation during the recent turmoil and riot, stressing the need to clearly establish the thought of wholeheartedly relying on the working class. Wholeheartedly relying on the working class includes relying on intellectuals, but the core is relying on industrial workers.

The session believed that the documents of the 11th Trade Union Congress and the "Basic Ideas for Trade Union Reform" are in line with the spirit of the 13th Party Congress and should continue to be implemented and improved. Trade unions are mass organizations of the working class, and all levels of trade unions, including enterprise trade unions, must work under the leadership of the Party to ensure the correct political direction. However, trade unions should not be equated with a department of the Party committee. Trade unions should have relative independence and autonomy in their work, and they should safeguard the interests of the workers. Representatives said that trade unions sometimes have different views from managers on certain issues, which is not a bad thing. Trade unions should become a democratic channel to reflect workers' opinions. Specific conflicts should be resolved through democratic consultation. Some representatives suggested establishing a joint conference system between the government and trade unions.

The session emphasized that China can only have one trade union and will not allow the establishment of a trade union of an anti-Party nature. If such a tendency emerges, trade union organizations must clearly oppose it.

The session proposed that it is important to eliminate the influence of bourgeois liberalization. The influence of bourgeois liberalization on the working class, especially young workers, should not be underestimated. All levels of trade unions should strengthen their educational functions, making trade unions a school of communism and a school of management. Currently, it is necessary to strengthen education on patriotism, the basic line, and the spirit of the working class as masters of the country. Our country has achieved significant results in the past decade, but there are also some underlying problems. The economic situation is severe. It is necessary to educate and mobilize workers to recognize the problems, rally their spirits, and overcome difficulties.

Representatives said during the discussion that during the session, several central leaders had discussions with the attendees, listened carefully to the opinions of local trade union comrades, and gave important speeches addressing the issues raised. This is the first time in many years. This shows that after the suppression of the turmoil and riot, the new central leadership attaches great importance to the role of the working class as the main force and the role of trade unions, making the direction of trade union reform and work clearer, and our hearts more confident.

Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Zhu Houze, spoke at the closing session today. The session also passed a resolution on mobilizing all workers nationwide to carry out the "Double Increase and Double Save" campaign, calling on workers of all ethnic groups to embody the spirit of the working class as masters of the country and the spirit of self-reliance and hard work. They are urged to make contributions to exceeding the national economic and social development plan for this year and ensuring the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

### 全总十一届三次主席团会议提出  积极推进工会的工作和改革

    全总十一届三次主席团会议提出
    积极推进工会的工作和改革
    本报北京7月28日讯  本报记者张国荣、新华社记者朱幼棣报道：全总十一届三次主席团（扩大）会议今天闭幕。会议期间，代表们围绕党的十三届四中全会确定的四件大事，集中精力，想大事，议大事，顾大局，在重大问题上取得了思想一致。会议提出，要努力贯彻全心全意依靠工人阶级的思想，积极推进工会工作和工会改革。
    会议充分肯定了工人阶级在这次动乱和暴乱中发挥了稳定大局的作用，强调必须明确树立全心全意依靠工人阶级的思想。全心全意依靠工人阶级包括了依靠知识分子，但核心是依靠产业工人。
    会议认为，工会十一大文件和《工会改革的基本设想》是符合十三大精神的，应该继续贯彻执行，不断总结完善。工会是工人阶级的群众组织，各级工会包括企业工会都必须在党的领导下工作，才能够保证自己正确的政治方向。但是，决不能把工会等同于党委的一个部门。工会要有相对的独立性，要独立自主地开展工作，要维护职工群众的利益。代表们说，工会有时候会跟厂长在有些问题上看法不一致，这并不是什么坏事。工会应该成为一个民主渠道，通过这个渠道把工人的意见反映出来。确有具体矛盾要通过民主协商方式来解决。一些代表建议建立政府跟工会的联席会议制度。
    会议强调，中国只能搞一个工会，不能搞两个工会，决不允许成立反对党性质的工会。一有这种动向露头，工会组织必须旗帜鲜明地与之斗争。
    会议提出，肃清资产阶级自由化思潮的影响，要积极在工人阶级队伍中进行教育，这是一个非常重要的问题。资产阶级自由化对工人队伍特别是青年工人的影响不可低估。各级工会要加强教育职能，使工会成为共产主义大学校、学习管理的学校。在当前要切实加强对职工的爱国主义、基本路线和工人阶级主人翁精神的教育。我们国家十年来取得很大的成绩，但也潜伏着若干问题。经济形势是严峻的。要教育、动员职工认清问题，鼓足干劲、克服困难。
    代表们在讨论中说，会议期间，多位中央领导同志同与会同志一起座谈，认真听取地方工会同志的意见，针对大家提出的问题作了重要讲话，多年来还是第一次。这说明制止动乱和平息暴乱以后，新的中央领导班子对发挥工人阶级主力军作用和发挥工会作用的高度重视，使工会今后的改革和工作，方向更明了，我们心里踏实了，信心更足了。
    全国总工会副主席朱厚泽在今天的闭幕会议上讲了话。会议还通过了关于动员全国职工深入开展“双增双节”运动的决议，号召全国各族职工发扬工人阶级主人翁精神和奋发图强、自力更生的精神，为超额完成今年的国民经济和社会发展计划，保证国民经济的持续、稳定、协调发展作出贡献。
