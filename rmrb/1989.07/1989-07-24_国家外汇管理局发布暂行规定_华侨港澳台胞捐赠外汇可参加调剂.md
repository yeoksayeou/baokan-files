Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24th.

The State Administration of Foreign Exchange has recently issued interim regulations, approved by the State Council, regarding the participation of overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots' foreign currency donations in foreign exchange allocation.

The regulations state that if the recipient unit requests to include the received foreign currency donations in foreign exchange allocation, they must apply to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or the local branch. Various levels of government accepting foreign currency donations from overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots for disaster relief in their respective regions are allowed to participate in the allocation. The recipient units must use the RMB funds obtained from the allocation of foreign currency in accordance with the purpose specified in the donor's donation intent statement and may not divert them for other uses. Those who use the pretext of foreign currency donations to participate in foreign exchange allocation will be dealt with according to the "Implementation Details of Penalties for Violations of Foreign Exchange Management" once discovered.

At a press conference held today by the Administration for this regulation, an authoritative source explained that previously, only 40% of donated foreign currency was allowed to participate in foreign exchange allocation. After the implementation of the new interim regulations, the amount of donated foreign currency allowed to participate in foreign exchange allocation has significantly increased. This will help protect the patriotic enthusiasm of overseas Chinese, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan compatriots and assist them in realizing their wish to support the construction of their motherland in monetary form.

    国家外汇管理局发布暂行规定
    华侨港澳台胞捐赠外汇可参加调剂
    本报北京7月24日讯　记者施明慎报道：最近，经国务院批准，国家外汇管理局发布了关于华侨、港澳台同胞捐赠外汇参加外汇调剂的暂行规定。
    规定指出，受赠单位如要求将接受的捐赠外汇参加外汇调剂，须向国家外汇管理局或当地分局提出申请。各级政府接受华侨、港澳台同胞为支援本地区救灾捐赠的外汇，允许参加调剂。受赠单位调剂外汇所得人民币款项，必须按捐赠人的捐赠意愿书规定的用途使用，不得挪作它用。对借捐赠外汇为名，参加外汇调剂的，一经查实，将按《违反外汇管理处罚实施细则》论处。
    在该局今天为此规定举行的新闻发布会上，权威人士介绍说，过去捐赠外汇仅有40％被允许参加外汇调剂。实施新的暂行规定后，允许参与外汇调剂的捐赠外汇大大增加，将有助于保护华侨、港澳台同胞的爱国热情，有助于他们实现以货币形式支援祖国建设的愿望。
