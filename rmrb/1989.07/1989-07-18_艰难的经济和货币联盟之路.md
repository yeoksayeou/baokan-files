The 12 member states of the European Economic Community (EEC) held a summit in Madrid at the end of June, where after intense negotiations, they surprisingly reached a compromise on the issue of economic and monetary union. This progress, though "not significant," marks the EEC's entry into the arduous path of economic and monetary union after many twists and turns.

Achieving economic and monetary union is a necessary step for the EEC to consolidate the common market and realize full economic integration. The EEC member states have been working towards this goal for many years. As early as December 1969, the then six member states of the EEC formally proposed the goal of establishing a complete economic and monetary union at a summit in The Hague. However, due to the complexity of the issues involved and the need for member states to transfer part of their national sovereignty, implementation has been fraught with difficulties. Moreover, in the mid-1970s, the financial markets of the Western capitalist world experienced severe turmoil, and the EEC member states faced the most serious economic crisis since the war. Each major country was preoccupied with its own problems, and the plan to establish an economic and monetary union had to be shelved.

In March 1979, the EEC established the European Monetary System to create a stable currency area within the member states and mitigate the impact of dollar price fluctuations. Over the past decade, the European Monetary System has developed steadily. The European Currency Unit, as the core of this system, has played an important role in stabilizing Western European currencies and has gradually improved its position in the international financial market, becoming a rising star in the financial world.

However, the European Currency Unit is still a "basket currency" with monetary substance but no issued banknotes. How to turn it into a tangible currency as soon as possible has become the wish of more and more people in the EEC.

At the end of 1985, the EEC summit adopted the "European Integration Document," legally establishing the goal of achieving economic and monetary union. Last June's summit in Hanover further discussed this issue and entrusted the EEC Commission President Delors to form a committee consisting of central bank governors and experts from various member states to conduct a special study. In April of this year, the EEC published the committee's report on the establishment of an economic and monetary union (known as the Delors Report). The report proposed a three-step plan for achieving the union: first, starting from July 1990, the currencies of the 12 member states will all be included in the European Monetary System, strengthening the coordination of economic and monetary policies among the countries; second, establishing the European Central Bank system; third, establishing a unified European currency.

At this Madrid summit, Britain, under pressure from other member states, changed its previous hardline stance and agreed to the first phase of the Delors Report, agreeing to include the pound in the European Monetary System, thus avoiding the failure of the summit. However, Mrs. Thatcher proposed two preconditions for this: first, Britain's inflation rate must drop from the current 8.3% to below 5%; second, other countries must lift controls on exchange rates before the pound can join the European Monetary System. Therefore, EEC officials believe that while the summit has cleared the immediate obstacles, there are still differences between Britain and other member states on the fundamental points of the economic and monetary union (i.e., what kind of Europe to build). Mrs. Thatcher particularly emphasized that the Delors Report does not have the issue of automatically transitioning from the first phase to the next. This has laid the groundwork for future disputes.

It can be seen that the EEC will still face many difficulties in achieving economic and monetary union, and implementing the agreement reached at the Madrid summit will not be easy. France, which took over the presidency of the EEC on July 1, has expressed its determination to fully implement the agreement and propose further suggestions for the development of economic and monetary union. However, whether the "Iron Lady" Margaret Thatcher will change her attitude towards opposing the second and third phases of the Delors Report, and whether the economic and monetary union of the EEC will face reversals in the future, these are still questions.

    艰难的经济和货币联盟之路
    姚立
    欧洲共同体12国在6月底的马德里首脑会议上，经过激烈的讨价还价，出人意料地就经济和货币联盟问题达成了一项妥协，使欧共体在实现全面一体化的过程中取得了进展。这一进展尽管“不大”，但却标志着欧共体在经历了颇多周折后，最终踏上了艰难的经济和货币联盟之路。
    实现经济和货币联盟是欧共体巩固共同市场、实现全面经济联盟的必由之路，欧共体各国已为此进行了多年的努力。早在1969年12月，欧共体当时的6个成员国便在海牙举行的首脑会议上，正式提出了建立完整的经济和货币联盟的目标。由于这个目标所涉及的问题远比关税同盟和共同农业政策复杂，且关系到成员国要转让部分国家主权问题，因此，实施起来困难重重。加之，70年代中期，西方资本主义世界金融市场剧烈动荡，欧共体成员国发生了战后最严重的经济危机。各主要国家自顾不暇，建立经济和货币联盟的计划不得不搁置起来。
    1979年3月，欧共体为在成员国范围内建立一个稳定的货币区，缓和由于美元价格波动带来的冲击，创建了欧洲货币体系。10年来，欧洲货币体系得到了稳固的发展，作为该体系核心的欧洲货币单位在稳定西欧货币方面发挥了重要作用，在国际金融市场上的地位也不断提高，成为金融市场的一支后起之秀。
    但是，欧洲货币单位毕竟只是一种有货币之实、但不发行钞票的“篮子货币”。如何尽早将其变为看得见、摸得着的钞票，已成为欧共体越来越多人的愿望。
    1985年底，欧共体首脑会议通过了《欧洲一体化文件》，以法律形式确立了实现经济和货币联盟的目标。去年6月的汉诺威首脑会议进一步讨论了这一问题，并委托欧共体委员会主席德洛尔组成一个由各成员国中央银行行长和专家参加的委员会，专门对此进行研究。今年4月，欧共体公布了委员会关于建立经济和货币联盟的研究报告（简称德洛尔报告）。报告针对建立联盟的目标提出了三部曲：第一，自1990年7月1日起，12个成员国的货币全部纳入欧洲货币体系，加强各国经济和货币政策的协调；第二，建立欧洲中央银行体系；第三，建立统一的欧洲货币。
    在此次马德里首脑会议上，英国迫于其它成员国的压力，改变了原来的强硬立场，同意了德洛尔报告第一阶段的设想，答应将英镑纳入欧洲货币体系，使首脑会议避免了失败。但撒切尔夫人却为此提出了两个先决条件，即要待英国的通货膨胀率从目前的8.3％下降到5％以下，各国也取消了对汇率的控制后，英镑方能加入欧洲货币体系。因此，欧共体官员认为，会议虽扫清了眼前的障碍，但在经济和货币联盟的基本点（即建设一个什么样的欧洲）上，英国和其它成员国的分歧依旧。撒切尔夫人特别强调，德洛尔报告不存在由第一阶段“自动”转入下一阶段的问题。这就为今后的论争埋下了一个伏笔。
    由此可见，欧共体在实现经济和货币联盟的道路上仍将遇到重重困难，要执行马德里首脑会议达成的协议也决非易事。7月1日起担任欧共体执行主席国的法国已表示竭尽全力落实协议内容，同时为经济和货币联盟进一步的发展提出建议。但是，以“铁夫人”著称的玛·撒切尔首相能否改变反对德洛尔报告第二、三阶段的态度，欧共体的经济和货币联盟今后会不会出现反复，这些都还是个问号。
