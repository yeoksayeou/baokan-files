A recent lecture that caught widespread attention featured 10 Uyghur women who passionately spoke about the benefits of family planning for ethnic minorities.

Last July, Xinjiang issued a temporary regulation on family planning for ethnic minorities, allowing couples to have three children. Before this, the birth rate in Urumqi was 37.50‰ for Han people and 79.28‰ for ethnic minorities. Over the past year, 9,151 married couples in the city have received certificates for ethnic minority family planning, with 1,521 couples voluntarily choosing to have only one child. This year, the contraception rate among ethnic minorities reached 78.02%, and the late marriage rate was 85.67%, both higher than the rates for Han people.

    乌市少数民族节育率提高
    本报乌鲁木齐7月15日电  记者曾坤报道：一个令人耳目一新的演讲会，近日在这里引起普遍关注——10位对计划生育倾注极大热情的维吾尔族姐妹，以现身说法演讲少数民族实行计划生育的好处。
    新疆去年7月颁布的少数民族计划生育暂行规定，允许少数民族夫妇可生三个孩子。在这之前，乌鲁木齐市汉族生育率为37.50‰，少数民族为79.28‰，一年来，全市已领少数民族计划生育光荣证的已婚夫妇达9151对，其中自愿领取独生子女证的达1521对。今年上半年少数民族节育率达78.02％，晚婚率达85.67％，高于汉族晚婚率。
