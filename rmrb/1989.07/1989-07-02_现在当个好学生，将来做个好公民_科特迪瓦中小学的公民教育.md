Ivory Coast has introduced civic education courses in its primary and secondary schools as well as technical schools. Teachers not only pay attention to students' intellectual development but also place great emphasis on their moral education.

In discussing the necessity of civic education, *L'Amour Semaine* of Ivory Coast states that the country has been independent for twenty-eight years. Although it has achieved remarkable progress in the economic, social, and cultural spheres, it cannot be overlooked that during this period, some young people and adults have engaged in immoral behavior, traditional moral values have weakened, and there is a tendency to worship money and engage in corruption. They lack national spirit and patriotism, do not understand or do not value the duties of being an Ivorian, and know little about the state system, party organizations, and activities. The article states, "It is impossible to build a society where people are educated and economically prosperous but lack morality and patriotism."

During a visit to the central city of Bouaké, the reporter had the opportunity to visit a typical rural primary school. The school offers one civic education class per week for both the lower and upper primary grades. The school principal told the reporter that civic education classes have a moral enlightenment role for students and are crucial for their healthy growth. Teachers prepare carefully before class and use a method of teaching from small to large, from near to far, and from concrete to abstract. When explaining the state mechanism, they start from the village institutions and gradually expand to the district, county, province, and region, up to the national level. When teaching the lesson on "taxation," the teacher uses explanations and physical objects to help students understand the principle that "every citizen should pay taxes according to their property." They also organize students to visit the town hall, provincial party headquarters, tax bureau, and invite relevant personnel to the school for discussions with the students. Raising the national flag and singing the national anthem are indispensable daily activities. Through these diverse activities, students gradually establish concepts of the nation, government, and citizenship in their young minds, and basic knowledge and principles gradually combine. They regard the school as a small society, making students aware of their position and duties within this collective. Even in physical education activities, they embody the standards of civic virtues. At the end of the visit, the principal emphasized:

"The purpose of civic education classes is to firmly establish social behavioral moral norms in students, making them understand and abide by the various laws of our country. We educate these children to be good students now and good citizens in the future."

    “现在当个好学生，将来做个好公民”
    ——科特迪瓦中小学的公民教育
    本报记者　杨汝生
    科特迪瓦在全国的中小学和技术学校开设了公民教育课，教师不仅十分关心学生的智育，同时也很重视学生的德育。
    科特迪瓦《博爱周刊》在谈到公民教育的必要性时说，国家独立已经二十八年了，尽管在经济、社会和文化方面取得了卓越的成就，但不能不看到，在此期间，一些青年人和成年人有伤风化，传统道德价值淡薄，崇尚金钱，贪污受贿……，他们缺乏民族气节和爱国主义，不了解或不重视做为一个科特迪瓦人所应尽的义务，对国家体制、党的机构和活动也知之甚少。文章说，“建立一个人们受过教育、经济富足、但没有道德和爱国心的社会是不可能的。”
    在科特迪瓦中部城市布瓦凯采访时，记者曾有幸参观了一所普通的农村小学。该校在小学初级班和中级班每周都设立了一节公民教育课。学校负责人对记者说，公民教育课对学生来说带有道德启蒙的性质，它对儿童的健康成长至关重要。教师课前都经过认真的准备，课堂上则采取由小到大、由近及远、由具体到抽象的办法讲授。在讲解国家机制时，他们从本村的机构再逐步扩大到乡、县、省和大区，一直到国家。当讲到“纳税”一课时，教师通过讲解和实物，使学生明白“每个公民都应根据其财产缴纳税金”的道理。他们还组织学生参观市政厅、省党部、税务局等，还请有关的人士来校与学生座谈。升国旗，唱国歌更是每天不可缺少的。通过这些形式多样的活动，使学生在幼小的心灵里逐渐建立起国家、政府、公民等概念，使基础知识与基本原则逐渐结合起来。他们把学校比作一个小社会，让学生意识到自己在这个集体中的地位和应尽的义务，即使在文体活动中，也都蕴涵着公民的美德标准。参观结束时，这位负责人强调说：
  “公民教育课的目的是使学生牢固树立起社会行为的道德规范，使他们通晓并遵守我们国家的各种法规。教育这些孩子现在当个好学生，将来做个好公民。”
