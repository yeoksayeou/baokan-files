	“I Just Have the Entrepreneurial Itch!”
	—A Profile of Former Beijing Businessman Zhou Guohao
	By People's Daily Reporter Pi Shuyi

	Not fat, not thin, with a kind and benevolent face, Zhou Guohao presents the image of a loyal and honest elder. Upon first meeting Zhou Guohao, one might wonder: Is this the capitalist of old? For a considerable period, some works of art had shaped a "standard image" of capitalists in people's minds. This image is hard to reconcile with the former businessman who is still on the front lines of economic activity today.

	Calling him a capitalist, in fact, his capital was meager. At the time of liberation, Zhou Guohao was 25 years old, one of the youngest private entrepreneurs in Beijing. Although he started doing business at the age of 15, it was not until 1947 that he established his own factory—Zhongxing Hat Factory, with a capital of only 4,000 yuan, which belonged to the four brothers of the Zhou family.

	Zhou Guohao was energetic! In 1953, he joined forces with 16 other hat factories to establish the Jian Guo Joint Venture Hat Factory. In 1956, he responded to the call for public-private cooperation, and the joint venture factory became the Beijing Hat Factory. This hat factory is still the largest in Beijing today.

	At that time, Zhou Guohao served as the deputy director of the Beijing Hat Factory, naturally representing the "private sector." During the Cultural Revolution, he was inevitably caught up in the turmoil. Zhou Guohao was criticized and struggled against, sent to work in the workshop, until 1980 when policies were rectified, he resumed his position as deputy director, but he did not serve for long before reaching retirement age.

	After so many years of turmoil, his heart finally settled, but with nothing to do, Zhou Guohao could not stay idle. In his own words, "I just have the entrepreneurial itch!" From private enterprises to state-owned enterprises, Zhou Guohao accumulated rich experience in enterprise management. In the era of reform and opening up, he was eager to show his skills.

	It was fortunate that the Chaoyang District's Shiliupukou Township invited him to help with township enterprises. In 1984, he led 100 people who had split from the township garment factory to establish the Beijing Chaoyang District Changcheng Hat Factory. In 1987, he established the Beijing Chaoyang District Changcheng Fur Products Welfare Factory, providing jobs for a group of disabled people. At over 60 years old, Zhou Guohao held two positions, serving as the director of both factories.

	"People call goods a thousand times, but goods call people without a word." This is a phrase Zhou Guohao often says. Running a business means producing goods that attract people. The hat industry is highly competitive, and Zhou Guohao is strict with quality management! Each team has quality inspectors, and from semi-finished products to finished products, they go through multiple inspections. There is also a monthly quality competition. This competition is a surprise inspection. At any time, products can be taken directly from the production line for inspection and evaluation. Teams and individuals with poor quality will have their bonuses deducted, without any leniency. Of course, those with good quality are also rewarded. Strict quality management, combined with technical training, turned farmers who were used to dealing with soil into producers of high-quality hats. Changcheng fur hats have been exported abroad. In 1987, the Beijing municipal quality competition for township and town shoe and hat industries, Changcheng Hat Factory came in first. Last year, the Changcheng brand "Da Qianjin" hat was rated as a Beijing municipal excellent product. Recently, they just held the autumn and winter product order meeting for this year, and immediately secured 5 million yuan worth of orders.

	Zhou Guohao and the leaders and masses of Shiliupukou Township get along very harmoniously. They trust Zhou Guohao, and Zhou Guohao also brings all his skills to the table. Every morning at seven o'clock, he comes from a distant place to the factory and works all day.

	Zhou Guohao is actually a social activist! He serves as a member of the Chongwen District Political Consultative Conference and the branch director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, actively participating in social and political activities. From him, one can feel the attraction and cohesion of the socialist cause.

	At this age, what is he still striving for? To this question, Zhou Guohao replied: "First, to contribute to economic development. In the old society, it was difficult to do small businesses, and after liberation, there was the 'leftist' approach. Now, with the reform and opening up, the party's policies are good, and it is the time to do things. Second, to guide the young people. Township enterprises are an important path to rural prosperity. I want to pass on my commercial economic knowledge to the farmers. Now, some people still have a wrong 'merchant' concept, thinking that doing commercial economy relies on speculation and trickery, which is very one-sided. Running a business, there is a lot of knowledge in it!"

	These words are indeed true.

    “我就有搞企业的瘾！”
    ——记北京市原工商业者周国浩
    本报记者　皮树义
    不胖不瘦，慈眉善目，一副忠厚长者的形象。初见周国浩，心里嘀咕：这就是当年的资本家？过去一个相当长的时间，一些文艺作品曾经给人们塑造出了资本家的“标准形象”。这形象与这位至今仍在经济生活第一线上奋斗着的原工商业者很难对上号了。
    说他是资本家，其实资本少得可怜。解放之初，周国浩25岁，是北京市最年轻的私人企业主之一。虽然他从15岁就开始学做买卖，可直到1947年才办起了个自己的工厂——中兴帽厂，资本才4000元，还属于周家4个兄弟。
    周国浩积极着呢！1953年，他联合16家帽厂，办起了建国联营帽厂。1956年，他又响应公私合营的号召，联营帽厂变成了北京帽厂。这家帽厂，现在仍然是北京市最大的帽厂。
    那时，周国浩担任了北京帽厂的副厂长，当然是代表“私方”的副厂长。到了“文革”，自然是在劫难逃。周国浩被批来斗去，下放车间劳动，直到1980年落实政策，才重任副厂长，可没干几年，又到了退休的年龄。
    折腾了这么多年，揪着的心才放下了，却闲来无事，周国浩哪能呆得住。用他自己的话说，我就有搞企业的瘾！从私营企业到国营企业，周国浩积累了丰富的企业管理经验，在改革开放的年代里他愿大显身手。
    也巧，朝阳区十八里店乡请他帮着办乡镇企业。1984年，他领着从乡办服装厂分出的100人，办起了北京市朝阳区长城制帽厂。1987年，他又办起了北京市朝阳区长城皮毛制品福利厂，安置了一批残疾人。60多岁的周国浩一身二任，当着两个厂的厂长。
    “人叫货千声不语，货叫人不招即来”。这是周国浩常说的一句话。办企业就是要生产出能招人的货来。帽子行业竞争激烈，周国浩抓质量管理也严着呢！班组都有质量检验员，从半成品到成品，要经过多道检验。每月还有质量评比。这评比是突然袭击式的。不定什么时候，直接从生产线上拿下产品检验评比，质量差的班组、个人要扣奖金，一点也不含糊。当然，质量好的也给予奖励。严格的质量管理，再加上技术培训，与土坷垃打交道的农民生产出了质量优良的帽子。长城皮帽已出口国外。1987年北京市乡镇鞋帽行业质量评比，长城帽厂得了第一。去年，长城牌大前进帽被评为北京市优产品。前些日子，他们刚开了今年的秋冬季产品订货会，一下子就订出了500万元的货。
    周国浩和十八里店乡的领导、群众合作和相处得很融洽。他们信任周国浩，周国浩也把自己的全副本事都使出来。每天早晨七点多钟，他就从很远的地方来到工厂，一忙就是一天。
    周国浩其实还是个社会活动家哩！他担任了崇文区政协委员、民主建国会的基层支部主任等职务，是社会政治活动的积极分子。从他的身上，使人感到了社会主义事业的吸引力和凝聚力。
    这么大岁数了还图个啥？对这个问题，周国浩回答：“一是为发展经济发挥余热。旧社会小本买卖难做，解放后又遇到‘左’的一套，如今改革开放，党的政策好，正是干事的时候。二是带带年轻人。乡镇企业是农村致富的重要道路。我要把自己的商品经济知识传授给农民。现在，还有人有一种错误的‘奸商’的观念，认为搞商品经济要靠投机取巧，这是非常片面的。搞企业，这里面有的是学问！”
    这话说得实在。
