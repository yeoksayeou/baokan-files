Today, optical wave technology is transforming global communication systems. People refer to this series of major technological revolutions since the advent of electronic computers as the second wave of the information age.

More than 100 years ago, American scientist Alexander Graham Bell conducted an experiment, using a beam of sunlight as a carrier to transmit telephone signals over 200 meters. Although his optical telephone was never commercially produced, his idea of using light to transmit data has evolved into today's optical communication. About 10 years ago, scientists invented optical fibers. These transparent glass fibers, thinner than a hair, are now, along with microelectronics and software, recognized as three major technologies.

Due to the rapid development of lasers, light-emitting diodes, receivers, and digital converters, today's optical fibers can transmit several billion bits of information per second, which is 1000 times the capacity of ordinary wires. Optical fibers are gradually supplementing and replacing traditional copper wires, bringing about a revolution in information technology. They can improve the efficiency of long-distance telephone companies, and since there are no delays or echoes in signals when using optical fibers for calls, and electromagnetic interference is eliminated, they also provide users with high-quality communication. Optical fibers will facilitate the establishment of a new global communication network, allowing people around the world to exchange vast amounts of voice, fax, and computer information. Spain has laid optical fiber cables to meet the large communication needs of the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and the Seville World Expo. The Paris Metro uses optical fiber cables for internal traffic signals and calls, and broadcasts entertainment programs inside the carriages. The American home shopping network uses optical fibers to transmit 100,000 phone calls daily, allowing customers to see the displayed products on cable TV screens and then place orders by phone.

Since 1980, approximately 13 million kilometers of optical fiber cables have been laid in Europe, North America, and Asia. By 1992, this number will double. In April of this year, a consortium of 30 major companies from the United States and Japan laid a 13,000-kilometer-long Pacific seabed optical fiber cable connecting the United States, Hawaii, Guam, and Japan. This cable, as thick as a rubber hose, can simultaneously transmit 40,000 international long-distance calls, whereas the original transoceanic copper cables and satellites could only transmit 6,000 calls. In December last year, an optical fiber cable was laid between Europe and North America across the Atlantic. In the next few years, several more seabed optical fiber cables will be laid, allowing 60,000 to 80,000 international long-distance calls to be made simultaneously around the world.

Because optical fibers can act as extremely small and accurate sensors, they will also open up new fields in medicine, industry, and defense technology.

In the next 10 years, the primary use of optical fibers will still be in telecommunications. However, the combination of optical fibers with microelectronics and software will greatly advance broadband technology. With optical fibers transmitting information, microelectronics managing it, and software linking the two, broadband technology will be able to provide countless channels and transmit any voice, audio-visual, and data, connecting the entire world.

As part of the European Eureka research program, 14 automobile manufacturers and 50 research institutes are developing new types of cars and aircraft using optical fibers to replace ordinary wires. These vehicles can be controlled by computers for braking, refueling, or other purposes. The U.S. Navy is developing aircraft that fly using light. Due to the replacement of ordinary wires and mechanical control devices with optical fibers, the weight is reduced and stability is increased. Coupled with the ability of optical fibers to resist electrical interference, these aircraft can be used as airborne radar stations. The U.S. Department of Defense is also researching the use of optical fibers to improve the functionality of underwater listening devices for submarine detection.

Currently, the cost of optical fibers is 3 to 5 times higher than that of ordinary wires or coaxial cables. However, with continuous development, the cost of optical fibers will gradually decrease. By the end of this century, as the use of optical fibers becomes more widespread, people will also update many of their concepts about communication and connectivity.

    光技术改变世界通讯系统
    梁丽
    今天，光波技术正在改变全世界的通讯系统。人们把电子计算机问世以来的这一系列重大技术革命称作是信息时代的第二次浪潮。
    100多年前，美国科学家亚历山大·贝尔曾作过试验，以一束阳光为载波，将电话讯号传送了200米。他的光线电话机虽然从未进行商业性生产，但他的用光传递数据的想法已发展为今天的光学通讯。大约在10年前，科学家发明了光学纤维。这些比头发丝还细的透明玻璃纤维束今天已与微电子和软件一起，并列为3项重大技术。
    由于激光、发光二极管、接收器及数字转换器这些方面的迅速发展，今天的光学纤维已能每秒钟传导几十亿比特的信息，比普通电线的负载量大上1000倍。光纤正在逐步补充和取代传统的铜制电线，带来信息技术的一场革命。它能提高长途电话公司的效率，而且由于用光纤打电话时信号不会有停顿或回声，也排除了电磁干扰，所以它也为使用者提供高质量的通话。光纤将促成世界范围的新通讯网，各地人们能彼此交换极大量的声音、传真和计算机的信息。西班牙已为1992年巴塞罗那奥林匹克运动会和塞维尔世界博览会的大量通讯需要敷设光纤电线。巴黎地铁用光纤电线来进行内部交通讯号及通话，在地铁车厢内广播文娱节目。美国的家庭购物网用光纤来传导每天的10万个电话，使顾客能从电缆电视屏幕上看到展销的商品，然后打电话购买。
    自从1980年以来，在欧洲、北美和亚洲已敷设了约1300万公里的光纤电线。到1992年还将增加1倍。今年4月，美国、日本30家大公司组成的康采恩敷设了连接美国、夏威夷、关岛和日本的长1.3万公里的太平洋海底光纤电缆。这个橡皮水管粗细的电缆能同时传送4万路国际长途电话，而原来的越洋铜线电缆和卫星只能传送6000路电话。去年12月，欧洲、北美之间已敷设了横跨大西洋光纤电缆。今后几年还将敷设几条海底光纤电缆，届时世界各地将能同时有6万到8万路国际长途电话通话。
    由于光纤能作为极细小而又准确的传感器，它也将开拓医学、工业和国防科技的新领域。
    今后10年，光纤的最大用途仍是电话方面。但是，光纤与微电子、软件相结合，将大大发展宽频技术。由光纤传递信息、微电子加以管理，软件将二者相联系，广频技术将能提供无数频道和传送任何声音、音像和数据，将整个世界联为一体。
    作为欧洲国家尤里卡科研计划的一部分，14个汽车厂和50个研究所正用光纤代替普通电线研制新型汽车和飞机，它们能用计算机控制制动器、加油或作其他用途。美国海军正在研制用光飞行的飞船，由于用光纤代替普通电线和机械控制装置，减轻了重量和增加了稳定性。加上光纤能抗电干涉，这种飞船可以用作空中雷达站。美国国防部也在研究用光纤来改进水听器侦察潜艇的功能。
    目前，光纤的成本比普通电线或双轴电线要贵3至5倍。但是由于不断发展，光纤的成本将逐步下降。到本世纪末，随着光纤使用的普及，人们也将更新对通讯联络的许多概念。
