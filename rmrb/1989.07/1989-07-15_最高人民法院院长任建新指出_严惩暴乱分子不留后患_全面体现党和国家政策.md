Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 15th.

The recent nationwide turmoil and the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing have been a severe test for everyone. The vast majority of comrades in the judicial system across the country have passed this test, and the vast majority of judicial personnel in Beijing have handed in a qualified answer sheet in this unannounced exam.

Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, made these remarks today at the commendation meeting for the advanced deeds of the Beijing judicial system in stopping the turmoil and quelling the riot.

Ren Jianxin pointed out: At present, we must press on and fully mobilize and rely on the masses to thoroughly investigate and bring to justice those who plotted, organized, and directed the turmoil and riot, those who participated in the riot as counter-revolutionaries, and those who committed various serious criminal acts of beating, smashing, looting, arson, and murder. We must eliminate any lingering threats to further stabilize the national situation.

Given that the judicial organs in Beijing bear the heavy responsibility of trying counter-revolutionary riot cases, Ren Jianxin emphasized, "In view of the complexity of this struggle, the people's courts must pay attention to correctly implementing policies and strictly proceeding in accordance with the law in their judicial work. They must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions; strictly distinguish between criminal and non-criminal offenses; and strictly distinguish between counter-revolutionary crimes and ordinary criminal offenses. In determining the charges for such cases, we must be practical and concrete, analyzing each specific case and determining the charges according to the provisions of the criminal law. We must earnestly implement the policy of combining punishment with leniency, being lenient to those who confess and strict to those who resist. We must be strict when we need to be strict and lenient when we need to be lenient, fully reflecting the policies of the Party and the state."

Ren Jianxin called for actively launching

    最高人民法院院长任建新指出
    严惩暴乱分子不留后患  全面体现党和国家政策
    本报北京7月15日讯  “这次发生的全国性动乱和北京反革命暴乱，对每一个人都是一次极其严峻的考验。全国法院系统绝大多数同志都经受住了考验，北京市法院系统绝大多数干警在这场不考试的考试中向党向人民交了合格的答卷。”这番话是最高人民法院院长任建新今天在北京市法院系统制止动乱、平息暴乱先进事迹表彰会上所说的。
    任建新指出：当前，要乘胜前进，充分发动和依靠群众，把那些策划、组织、指挥动乱和暴乱的阴谋分子，参与暴乱的反革命分子和进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀的各种严重刑事犯罪分子，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地清查出来，依法严惩，不留后患，以进一步稳定全国局势。
    由于北京市审判机关直接负有审判反革命暴乱案件的重担，任建新特别强调，“鉴于这场斗争的复杂性，人民法院在审判工作中，必须注意正确执行政策，严格依法办事，做到严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾；严格区分罪与非罪的界限；严格区分反革命犯罪与普通刑事犯罪的界限。对这类案件如何定罪，应当实事求是，具体案件，具体分析，依照刑法规定，构成什么罪，就定什么罪。要认真贯彻惩办与宽大相结合，坦白从宽、抗拒从严的政策，该严的一定要严，该宽的一定要宽，以全面体现党和国家的政策。”
    任建新要求积极开展严厉打击流窜犯和其他严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子的专项斗争，依法严惩各种严重刑事犯罪分子。
    针对惩治腐败问题，任建新提出，各级法院要坚定不移地同贪污、受贿的犯罪行为作斗争，坚决惩治投机倒把，特别是“官倒”，继续依法严厉打击严重经济犯罪活动。
