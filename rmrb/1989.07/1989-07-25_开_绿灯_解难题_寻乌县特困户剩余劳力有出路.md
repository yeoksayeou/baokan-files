Xunwu County, located in the old revolutionary base area of southern Jiangxi Province, has relied on the strength of the entire society over the past two years. By adopting scientific guidance, unified planning, and local absorption methods, the county has earnestly addressed the issue of surplus labor in poor households facing difficulties in finding employment. According to statistics, more than 6,000 surplus laborers have been placed in jobs, accounting for two-thirds of the total labor force in poor households, achieving an income of over 5 million yuan, with an average of nearly 1,000 yuan per person.

The issue of surplus labor in poor households facing difficulties in finding employment has long been a pressing problem in Xunwu County's poverty alleviation work. Since last year, the county's Party committee and government have placed this issue on the agenda for government work. They have held multiple meetings with relevant departments to jointly analyze the current situation of labor in poor households and have called on the entire society to open the "green light" for solving their employment problems. The focus is mainly on agricultural development and establishing green enterprises in the mountains. The county has specially organized 10 training sessions on practical skills for surplus labor in poor households, providing effective services for their employment and solving their employment issues.

    开“绿灯”  解难题
    寻乌县特困户剩余劳力有出路
    本报讯　地处赣南老区的江西省寻乌县近两年依靠全社会力量，采取科学引导、统一安排、就地消化等方式，认真解决特困户剩余劳力“出路难”问题。据统计，目前全县已有6000多名剩余劳力得到安置，占特困户劳力总数的2／3，实现收入500多万元，人均近千元。
    特困户剩余劳力多、出路难，一直是寻乌县老区扶贫工作急待解决的矛盾。县委、县政府从去年开始，把这一问题摆上政府工作的议事日程，多次召开有关职能部门会议，共同分析特困户劳力的现状，要求全社会都来为解决他们的出路开“绿灯”。重点主要放在农业开发、上山办绿色企业。县里专门为特困户主办了10期剩余劳力实用技术培训班，为他们安排就业、解决出路提供有效服务。（陈吉昌）
