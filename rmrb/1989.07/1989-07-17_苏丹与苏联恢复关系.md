Sudan and the Soviet Union Resume Relations

Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, July 16 — Chairman of the Sudanese Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation and Prime Minister Omar al-Bashir has stated that he is determined to restore Sudan's relations with the Soviet Union, which have been deteriorating since the 1980 coup.

According to the Kuwaiti newspaper *Al-Siyassah*, Bashir has requested the Soviet Union's chargé d'affaires in Sudan to convey his intention to the Soviet leadership. The new Sudanese leader also expressed his hope that the Soviet Union will assist in the repair of factories built with Soviet aid.

Sudan once had good relations with the Soviet Union until 1980, when a coup, allegedly backed by the Soviet Union, attempted to overthrow former Sudanese President Jaafar Nimeiry. Since General Bashir's coup on June 30 this year, which overthrew former Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi, relations between the two countries have begun to improve.

    苏丹与苏联恢复关系
    新华社科威特7月16日电　苏丹救国革命指挥委员会主席、政府总理巴希尔表示，他决心恢复自1980年政变以来一直处于滑坡的苏丹同苏联关系。
    据科威特《政治报》报道说，巴希尔已经要求苏联驻苏丹临时代办向苏联领导人转达他的这一意愿。这位苏丹新领导人还表示希望苏联帮助检修苏联援建的工厂。
    苏丹曾同苏联有着良好的关系，直到1980年苏丹发生了一起据称受到苏联支持的企图推翻苏丹前总统尼迈里的政变为止。自巴希尔将军于今年6月30日发动政变推翻前总理迈赫迪以来，两国关系开始好转。
