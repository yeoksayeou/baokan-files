Gawking, in China, has a "long history" and can be considered one of China's great "national treasures."

In ancient novels and miscellaneous books, we often see scenes of crowds gathering at street corners and alleyways, with spectators jam-packed. Among these, there are those who gather to watch street performers and monkey shows, those who gather to watch fights and brawls, and those who gather to watch public executions and beheadings. Among the gawkers, their attitudes vary: some seek spiritual stimulation, some hunt for street gossip, some cheer for street dramas, and others simply join in the fun.

Today, although Chinese society has entered the late 1980s, the tradition of gawking remains unchanged. On streets and alleys, it is common to see crowds gathering like ants, creating a chaotic scene. Whether it's a traffic accident or a verbal dispute between pedestrians, it can attract a large crowd of onlookers. Someone joked that one person watching an ant climb a tree can attract dozens of people to gawk. This is not an exaggeration.

In recent student protests, many compatriots, with patriotic fervor or curiosity and a desire to watch the spectacle, flocked to the streets to gawk. I believe that the vast majority of gawkers are blameless. However, the effects cannot be ignored. For example, at one point, some students mistakenly believed that shouting slogans made them "representatives of the people" and "proud children of the times," leading to heated blood and clouded judgment, unable to control themselves. When the military entered the city to enforce martial law, some gawkers became shields for a few rioters, allowing them to run amok, committing heinous crimes, causing great sacrifices for the military, significant losses to state property, and making it difficult to implement necessary measures. Even in such circumstances, some gawkers inevitably paid the price for not heeding government announcements. This painful lesson is worth deep reflection by the Chinese people.

According to psychology, gawkers have a herd mentality. Many of those who join in the fun are driven by this mentality. However, the herd mentality is not always healthy. Under this mentality, people often easily make mistakes of blindly following and acting rashly, often losing their reason and doing things that cause pain to loved ones and pleasure to enemies. In the turmoil and riots in Beijing, many who blocked military vehicles and threw stones and bricks at the troops were likely driven by this mentality.

The phenomenon of gawking is a product of a closed society and a slow-paced life. When people live in a closed and slow-paced environment for too long, they often feel bored or unfulfilled, leading to numbness of the nerves. At this point, any small incident can excite the nearly numb soul and stir up passionate emotions. Thus, through gawking and joining in the fun, they seek psychological compensation and satisfy their emotional curiosity. In Chinese history, reformers like Wu Qi were killed and their bodies exposed in the streets, Shang Yang was executed by being torn apart by chariots and his body left in the market, Tan Sitong's failed reform led to his beheading in Beijing's Caishikou market, and even Ah Q was wrongly accused, paraded through the streets, and shot. These are all great tragedies in history. What beauty or interest is there in them? Yet, the people were enthusiastic, gathering to watch, bustling and lively. This is a tragic and numb curiosity.

In some highly tense and fast-paced countries, gawking is rare. Even if a few nude dancers appear on the street, aside from police intervention, people at most glance a few times and then continue on their way, doing their own things.

Gawking may excite the nerves, but its essence is still numbness. Like in ancient times, when Han Xin was humiliated by a bully and no one in the market stood up for him, where was the sense of justice?

In today's society, there are sometimes individuals who commit crimes in broad daylight, and the onlookers stand by, indifferent. This numbness is chilling. In the past, when Lu Xun saw a group of strong but numb-looking compatriots watching the beheading of a fellow countryman, his heart was filled with sadness and anger, leading him to abandon medicine and take up literature, determined to "change the spirit of the nation" and "dedicate my blood to the Yellow Emperor." This spirit of concern for the country and the people is still worth promoting today.

    说围观
    杨洪立
    围观，在中国是有“悠久历史”的，也可称得上是中国的一大“国粹”吧。
    我们看古代小说杂书，常可见到街头巷尾人头攒动，观者如堵的场景。其中，有围观卖艺、耍猴的，有围观打架斗殴、泼皮相骂的，也有围观游街示众、行刑问斩的等等。在围观者中间，其心态也大凡各异：有的寻求精神刺激，有的猎取市井新闻，有的为街头闹剧呐喊助威，还有的则纯属在一旁凑热闹。
    今天，中国社会虽然进到了二十世纪八十年代末叶，但嗜好围观的“传统”仍没失传。街肆路旁，常见有人群如蚁、嘈杂万状的情景。不论是发生交通事故，还是路人争吵几句，都能引来大批人的围观。有人揶揄道：一人于街上看蚂蚁上树可以引来几十人围观。这决非戏言。
    在前不久一些大学生上街游行时，许多同胞怀着爱国热情或怀着好奇、看热闹种种心态，纷纷走上街头围观。我以为绝大多数围观者是无可指责的。但效果却不能不作些分析。比如一时间，使学生中的某些人自以为乱喊口号也成了人民群众的“代表”，成了时代潮流的“骄子”，以至于热血沸腾，头脑发昏，不能自已起来。在部队执行戒严任务开进市区时，有的围观的同胞又成了极少数暴徒的保护伞，使他们得以肆意逞凶，犯下了累累罪行，使部队付出了很大牺牲，国家财产受到很大损失，许多应该出手的措施难以实行。即便在这种情况下，有的围观者仍不可避免地为自己不听政府公告，因而付出了代价。这个惨痛的教训，是值得引起国人的深思的。
    按心理学说，围观者中有一种从众心理。许多凑热闹者，就是此种心理在起作用。不过，从众心理并非都是健康心理。因为，在这种心理下，人们往往很容易犯轻信盲从而致于盲动的错误，往往极易失掉理智而做出亲者痛、仇者快的事情。在北京发生的动乱和暴乱中，许许多多跟着拦阻军车，向部队扔石头砖头的人，恐怕就是受这种心理驱使的。
    围观现象乃封闭社会的畸形心理，是慢节奏生活的衍生物。当人们在封闭状态和慢节奏中生活久了，常常会感到闲得无聊或活得没滋没味，以至于会引起神经的麻痹。这时，任何一点小事，都可以兴奋几近麻木的心灵，激起狂热的感情。于是，便通过围观、凑热闹，求得心理的补偿，满足其情感上少见多怪的需求。我国历史上的改革家吴起伏尸宫闱又曝尸街头，商鞅遭车裂之刑血淋淋地弃尸于市，谭嗣同变法失败被斩首于京都菜市口，乃至阿Q先生蒙冤被游街示众后吃了枪子，等等，这都是历史的大悲剧，其间有何美感，有何趣味？可是国人们却兴致盎然，围之观之，熙熙攘攘，起劲得很。这是可悲的麻木的好奇心。
    在一些生活高度紧张和快节奏的国家，很少发生围观现象。即便有几位天体女郎上街，除了警察干预外，人们至多瞄上几眼，尔后照走自己的路，照干自己的事。
    围观，似可兴奋神经，但其本质仍是麻木。像在两千多年前，韩信被恶少所欺，受辱胯下时，围观的“一市人皆笑”，竟无一人站出来打抱不平。这哪里还有什么正义感？
    今日社会中，常有个别歹徒于光天化日之下，行凶作恶时，围者竟作壁上观，其麻木不仁也令人齿冷。当年，鲁迅先生看到一伙体格强壮而神情麻木的国人，在围观将被枭首示众的同胞时，他心中的悲凉气愤是何等强烈，以至要弃医从文，立志“改变国民的精神”，要“我以我血荐轩辕”。这种忧国忧民的精神，今天仍是值得发扬光大的。
