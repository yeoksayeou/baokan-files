Anhui has honored a group of "clean officials" while severely punishing a group of "corrupt officials."

Our reporter Zhang Zhen Guo reports from Hefei: In the first half of this year, various levels of supervisory organs in Anhui received 9,217 letters and visits, investigated 1,116 cases, concluded 687 cases, and transferred 16 cases to judicial organs for handling. A total of 150 people received warnings, demerits, demotions, dismissals, and expulsions. Among them, 17 were county-level and department-level cadres. Economic losses totaling 7.95 million yuan were recovered. The director of the Traffic Police Brigade in Suzhou City, He Yan, accepted large bribes while handling private car registrations and has been transferred to the procuratorate for handling. The main responsible person of the Wangjiang County Government sold 1,000 tons of planned urea to the county agricultural materials company at a higher price and has been investigated and dealt with.

While cracking down on corruption and investigating illegal and disciplinary cases, Anhui's supervisory organs at all levels have paid great attention to promoting clean governance by officials. In the first half of this year, 50 administrative personnel at various levels were commended through internal publications and newspapers, radio, and other means, which promoted integrity and promoted the construction of clean governance.
