The vibrant cultural life of Mexico City is adorned with a blossoming Eastern art. Fuentes, who has managed a circus for half a century, told the reporter, "Mexicans have fallen in love with Chinese acrobatics." He explained to the packed audience at every show, "The Chinese are paragons of diligence and wisdom. Only acrobatics from Beijing are truly thrilling art."

The "Beijing acrobatics" mentioned by Fuentes, the founder of the United Circus of Mexico, actually refers to the Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe from China. In 1987, the Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe first responded to the invitation of the United Circus to perform commercially in Mexico. Over 10 months, they performed 541 shows, each one a full house, making a resounding success. Subsequently, the Guiyang, Zigong, and Hunan Acrobatic Troupes from China also came to Mexico to collaborate with the United Circus in commercial performances. Each troupe consisted of about 10 to 20 people. They performed in more than 20 states across Mexico. The Hunan Acrobatic Troupe, which has been performing in Mexico for 5 months, is still touring in Morelos State. The Yunnan Acrobatic Troupe, which returned to China over a year ago, was invited back to Mexico City last week with a new lineup and new skills, once again winning the admiration of the Mexican people. The "Chinese acrobatics fever" has been enduring and has become a popular topic among Mexicans.

Over the past two years, Chinese acrobatics have brought unexpected economic and political benefits to Mexico through commercial performances. Each troupe earned more than $200,000 in foreign exchange during their 10 to 11 months of performances; at the same time, through the performance of traditional Chinese acrobatics, they showcased Chinese culture and the spirit of the Chinese people to the Mexican people.

    中国杂技饮誉墨西哥
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥城多彩的文化生活中盛开着一枝东方艺术的奇葩。经营了半个世纪马戏团的富恩特斯先生对记者说：“墨西哥人迷上了中国杂技。”他向场场爆满的观众解释节目时说：“中国人是勤劳与智慧的典范，只有北京来的杂技才是真正惊险的艺术。”
    墨西哥联合马戏团创始人富恩特斯所说的“北京来的杂技”，其实是中国云南杂技团。1987年，云南杂技团首先应联合马戏团邀请到墨西哥进行商业演出，10个月上演541场，场场爆满，一炮打响。之后，中国贵阳、自贡、湖南杂技团也先后来到墨西哥与联合马戏团进行商业合作演出。每个团十几二十余人不等。足迹遍及墨西哥20多个州。已经在墨西哥演出了5个月的湖南杂技团还在莫雷洛州巡回，回国才一年多的云南杂技团又应邀于上周再次来到墨西哥城，以新的面目、新的技艺再次赢得墨西哥人的赞誉。“中国杂技热”持久不衰，成为墨西哥人津津乐道的话题。
    中国杂技到墨西哥进行商业演出的两年多来，收到了意想不到的经济与政治效益。每个团在10到11个月的演出中都为国家创汇20余万美元；同时，通过中国传统杂技艺术表演，向墨西哥人民展示了中国文化与中国人民的精神风貌。（本报墨西哥城7月12日电）
