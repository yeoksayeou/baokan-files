The national-level scenic spot Mirror Lake has seen the most magnificent waterfall in 25 years. The waterfall is over 100 meters wide, with a flow rate of 1,800 cubic meters per second.

Since this spring, the upstream and lake areas of Mirror Lake have experienced severe drought, exposing the lakebed in many areas, an event described as a once-in-a-century occurrence. Entering mid-July, the Mirror Lake basin received heavy rainfall, causing the lake water to rise rapidly.
