Propaganda windows in cities are platforms for educating the public on the current situation and propagating the party's policies and guidelines, enriching the spiritual lives of the masses. However, some cities' propaganda windows are either left unused for long periods, or they do not pay attention to coordinating with the current central tasks, failing to update the propaganda content in a timely manner. Some are occupied by vendors during the "commercial fever," cluttering the windows with stalls, which affects the city's appearance and prevents the propaganda windows from fulfilling their intended roles.

The propaganda windows opposite the park in the center of our county town are a case in point. How to effectively manage propaganda windows is something that city authorities should pay close attention to.

    宣传橱窗的效用
    城市宣传橱窗，是进行形势教育和宣传党的方针政策、丰富群众精神生活的阵地。可是，有些城市的宣传橱窗，有的长期废而不用，有的不注意配合当前中心任务，及时更换宣传内容，有的在“经商热”中被生意人在橱窗前摆满了摊点，影响了市容，使宣传橱窗不能发挥应有的作用。
    我县县城街心公园对面的一排宣传橱窗和窗前的景况就是一个实例。如何搞好宣传橱窗，很值得城市有关部门重视。
