Soviet leader Gorbachev today pointed out that anti-socialist forces are attempting to exploit the current national situation, and this must be met with a cool head but not with indifference.

Gorbachev made these remarks while reporting to the Supreme Soviet on the situation of the miners' strike.

Gorbachev believes that the situation in the two major coal-producing regions of Kuzbass and Donbass is "very tense." He said that many of the issues raised by the miners have been resolved or decided to be resolved, but the strike continues; in Kuzbass, the strike committee has expressed a willingness to return to work, but people are still gathering; the disagreements involve some issues that cannot be resolved quickly. In addition, there are calls for railway workers to start a strike on August 1.

Gorbachev said that the state may be in a situation where it has to consider what forms to take to avoid losing control of the situation.

He emphasized that the working class is the main force in Soviet society, and in the current situation, it is necessary to rely on the organizational capacity, sense of responsibility, and loyalty to socialism and reform of the working class.

The Supreme Soviet of the USSR discussed the issue of the miners' strike, calling on the strikers to show reason and urging all workers in the country to show a high sense of responsibility during the turning point of reform.

Since July 10, miners in Kuzbass and Donbass have held large-scale strikes, demanding improvements to their "harsh living conditions." A government committee led by Politburo member and Central Committee Secretary Slyunikov is currently in Kuzbass handling the strike incident.

    戈尔巴乔夫谈矿工罢工问题
    对反动势力不能无动于衷
    新华社莫斯科7月19日电　苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天指出，反社会主义的势力企图利用目前国家的局势，对此必须保持冷静的头脑，但不能无动于衷。
    戈尔巴乔夫是在向最高苏维埃会议通报矿工罢工情况时说这番话的。
    戈尔巴乔夫认为，在库兹巴斯和顿巴斯这两个主要产煤区，形势“非常紧张”。他说，矿工提出的许多问题已经解决或决定要解决，但罢工还在继续；在库兹巴斯，罢工委员会表示复工，但人们仍在集会；分歧涉及一些无法尽快解决的问题。此外，有人还呼吁铁路工人从8月1日起开始罢工。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，国家可能处于这样一种形势，即不得不考虑采取何种形式来避免让局势失去控制。
    他强调说，工人阶级是苏联社会的主要力量，在当前形势下需要依靠工人阶级的组织性、责任心以及对社会主义和改革事业的忠诚。
    苏联最高苏维埃会议讨论了矿工罢工问题，呼吁罢工者表现出理智，号召全国的劳动者在改革的转折阶段表现出高度的责任感。
    从本月10日以来，库兹巴斯和顿巴斯的矿工举行了大规模罢工，要求改善“恶劣的生活条件”。一个由苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记斯柳尼科夫为首的政府委员会目前正在库兹巴斯处理罢工事件。
