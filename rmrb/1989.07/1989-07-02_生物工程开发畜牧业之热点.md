The cultivation of lean meat livestock has become a key development project for many developed countries, and many developing countries also attach great importance to it. This is due to the improvement of living standards and the pursuit of health and longevity.

In 1987, Cornell University in the United States began using a growth hormone to cultivate lean meat pigs, achieving success. These pigs grow 15% to 18% faster than ordinary pigs. Due to the improved feed conversion rate, feed costs are reduced by 24%. The growth hormone used by the university is produced from the pituitary gland of pigs. By 1988, the United States had developed a new method to make livestock produce lean meat. Scientists manipulate the hormones of livestock to change their characteristics, producing meat and dairy products that are cheaper and more nutritious. This hormone is produced through genetic engineering technology. Producing it this way is much cheaper than directly extracting it from the pituitary glands of livestock. The New York Times reported that by manipulating the natural hormones of livestock and controlling other chemical substances in the body that regulate growth, it is actually possible to change the characteristics of livestock overnight, rather than taking decades of genetic selection and crossbreeding as in the past.

A professor of animal nutrition at the University of Pennsylvania said that injecting pigs with natural growth hormones can accelerate their growth, increase the proportion of muscle tissue, and reduce the proportion of fat, while reducing the amount of feed used. In the research led by this professor, experts applied growth hormones for 77 days, doubling the lean meat in the pig's loin and reducing fat by 70%. It is estimated that using growth hormones in the United States alone can save $10-30 billion in feed costs per year.

Another method is to bypass the hormone system and directly use a substance called a beta-adrenergic agonist (β-agonist) to affect muscle and fat cells. This substance can mimic the actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline. When β-agonists inhibit the transformation of fat cells, these cells stop synthesizing fat and also break down fat. However, in muscle cells, β-agonists activate β-variants, which may inhibit protein synthesis and cause the cells to produce more protein.

Another approach is to use gene transplantation. In April 1988, a research team in Australia successfully bred a transgenic pig. The researchers injected a gene with an exogenous growth hormone into the pig's body. This transgenic pig reaches market weight 7 weeks earlier than ordinary pigs and converts feed into meat 30% more efficiently. They began breeding in 1985 and produced the 7th generation of pigs in 1988. Another research team also used this technology to breed transgenic sheep, which grow 30% faster than ordinary sheep. They have applied for animal patents.

Improving Milk Quality is Within Reach

In 1981, a team of American scientists successfully bred mice containing rabbit genes for the first time, marking significant progress in animal gene transplantation. Notably, in November 1987, British researchers used genetic engineering technology to express the β-lactoglobulin (BLG) gene of sheep in transgenic mice, altering the quality of the mice's milk.

The milk of mice contains a large amount of protein, with several proteins synthesized in the mammary glands being the main components. BLG is the main protein in the milk of ruminants such as cows and sheep, but it is not present in the milk of rodents (like mice). Genetic engineers injected the sheep BLG gene into the fertilized eggs of mice, which were then transplanted into the uterus of a mother mouse to continue development, resulting in transgenic mice carrying the sheep BLG gene. In these mice, the gene is fully expressed in the mammary glands during lactation, leading to significant changes in the composition of the milk. This gene can also be inherited through normal sexual reproduction to the next generation of mice and expressed.

Experts say that this experimental result shows that gene transplantation technology can be applied to mammals to improve milk quality, making it more suitable for dairy processing needs.

Enticing "Gene Feed"

The selection and control of feed are closely related to the development of livestock farming. Cultivating new types of feed is also a direction of genetic engineering efforts. For example, in 1988, Australian scientists successfully obtained the first genetically engineered plant—new type alfalfa. Feeding sheep with this alfalfa can promote wool growth.

This alfalfa is the most widely distributed sheep feed crop in Australia. Australian researchers conducted a decade-long exploration. Initially, they transferred a gene containing abundant protein (pea albumin) from pea seeds into the leaves of tobacco plants. Then, they transferred this gene into the leaves of alfalfa. This gene contains the genetic code for producing sulfur-containing amino acids, and the growth of sheep is generally limited by the supply of sulfur-containing amino acids in the feed. At the same time, pea albumin, unlike most other proteins, is not decomposed by the enzymes in the sheep's stomach and can enter the sheep's metabolic sequence intact, so almost all the nutrients are absorbed by the sheep and used to synthesize keratin, the component of wool.

This research result will increase wool production by 5%, adding 300 million Australian dollars to Australia's annual wool clipping total. Australian researchers are further studying to make this new type of alfalfa comply with the environmental release standards recently formulated by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) and plan to conduct comprehensive field experiments by early 1990, aiming to bring it to market as soon as possible.

    生物工程开发畜牧业之热点
    卢继传
    培育瘦肉型牲畜有法
    随着人类生活水平的提高以及对健康长寿的追求，培育瘦肉型牲畜的研究，几乎成了发达国家的重点开发项目，不少发展中国家也十分重视。
    1987年美国康奈尔大学就开始用一种生长激素培育瘦肉型的猪，并取得成功。这种猪的生长速度比普通猪快15％到18％。由于饲料转换率提高，饲料开支节省24％。这所大学所用的生长激素是用猪的脑垂体生产的。到1988年，美国探求出使牲畜产生瘦肉的新方法。科学家通过操纵牲畜激素来改变牲畜的性状，以生产价格较低廉和营养较高的肉与乳制品。这种激素是通过基因工程技术生产的。用这种技术生产要比直接从家畜脑垂体中提取的费用少得多。《纽约时报》报道，通过操纵家畜天然激素和控制生长的体内其他化学物质，实际上能够在一夜之间就改变牲畜的性状，而不像以往那样要经过数十载辛勤的遗传选择和杂交才能使牲畜发生性状的变化。
    宾夕法尼亚大学的一位动物营养教授说，给猪注射天然生长激素会使猪的生长加快，使肌肉组织占较大比例，脂肪占较小比例，而所用的饲料则减少。在这位教授领导的研究中，专家们施用生长激素77天以后，就使猪腰部的肉增加了一倍的瘦肉，减少了70％的脂肪。据统计，仅在美国使用生长激素一年，就可以节省饲料费10—30亿美元。
    另一种方法是撇开激素系统，直接使用一种称之为β—肾上腺素兴奋剂（简称β—兴奋剂）的物质来影响肌肉和脂肪细胞。这种物质能模拟肾上腺素和去甲肾上腺素这两种激素的作用。当β—兴奋剂抑制脂肪细胞变体时，该细胞就停止合成脂肪，同时还会分解脂肪。然而，在肌肉细胞中，由β—兴奋剂激活β变体，很可能通过抑制蛋白质而使该细胞生成更多的蛋白质。
    还有一种方法是采用基因移植。澳大利亚的一个研究小组1988年4月育成一头转移基因猪。研究人员把一种具有外来的生长激素基因注入这种猪体内。这种基因猪比普通猪提早7个星期上市，它把饲料转化成肉的效率比普通猪提高30％。他们从1985年开始培育，1988年育出了第7代猪。另一个研究小组也用这项技术培育转移基因绵羊，它比普通绵羊生长快30％。他们都申请了动物专利。
    改变乳汁品质可望成功
    1981年，美国一个科学家小组首次成功培育出含有带有兔子基因的老鼠之后，动物基因移植取得了长足的进步。其中，比较引人注目的是，1987年11月英国研究人员利用基因工程技术，使羊的β—乳球蛋白（BLG）基因在转化小鼠中表达，改变了小鼠乳汁的品质。
    小鼠乳汁中含有大量蛋白质，其主要组分是在乳腺中合成的几种蛋白质。BLG是牛羊等反刍动物乳汁中的主要蛋白，啮齿类动物（如鼠）的乳汁中不含这种蛋白。遗传工程师将羊BLG基因注射进小鼠的受精卵中，再将受精卵移植到母鼠子宫内继续发育，得到了携带羊BLG基因的转化小鼠。在这只鼠中，该基因于哺乳期乳腺充分表达，导致了乳汁成分的显著改变。该基因还可以通过正常的有性生殖，遗传给下一代小鼠并得到表达。
    有关专家说，这项实验成果表明可以将基因移植技术应用于哺乳动物，改良乳汁品质，使其更适于乳品加工的需要。
    诱人的“基因饲料”
    饲料的选择与控制与畜牧业发展关系很大。培育新型饲料也是遗传工程的努力方向。如1988年澳大利亚科学家成功获得第一种用遗传工程技术培育的植物——新型苜蓿，用这种苜蓿喂羊，能促进羊毛生长。
    这种苜蓿是澳大利亚分布最广的喂羊用的牧草作物。澳大利亚研究人员进行了长达10年之久的探索。开始时，他们把豌豆种子的一种含丰富的蛋白质（豌豆朊蛋白质）的基因转移到烟草作物的叶子中。然后，他们把这种基因转移到苜蓿的叶子里。这种基因含有制造富硫氨基酸的遗传密码，而羊的生长一般受饲草中硫氨基酸供应量的限制。同时，豌豆朊蛋白质同大多数其他蛋白质不同，它们不会被绵羊胃中的酶所分解，能完整地进入绵羊的代谢序列，所以，几乎所有的营养成分都被羊吸收，并用来合成角蛋白即羊毛的组分。
    这项研究成果将使羊毛产量提高5％，这使澳大利亚的年剪毛总产量增加3亿澳元。澳大利亚研究人员正在进一步研究，使这种新型苜蓿符合澳大利亚遗传操纵咨询委员会（GMAC）新近制定的环境投放准则，并打算在1990年年初进行全面的野外实验，并使其早日成为商品出售。
