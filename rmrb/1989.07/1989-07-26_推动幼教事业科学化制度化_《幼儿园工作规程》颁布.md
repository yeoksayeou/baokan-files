People's Daily, Beijing, July 26th - Reporter Wei Yufeng reports: The State Education Commission has issued the country's first relatively complete "Kindergarten Work Regulations," which will be implemented nationwide starting next February 1st.

A relevant official from the State Education Commission said at today's press conference that for a long time, while adhering to the policy of establishing kindergartens under local people's governments, various sectors of society have been mobilized and relied upon to establish kindergartens through multiple channels and forms. As a result, China's early childhood education has seen significant development. By the end of last year, there were 171,000 kindergartens of various levels and types nationwide, with 18.54 million children enrolled. However, whether in terms of the number of kindergartens or their quality, they still do not meet the requirements of socialist modernization for improving the quality of laborers and the entire nation.

The "Kindergarten Work Regulations" issued this time include a general provision and supplementary provisions, divided into 10 chapters.

In addition to expounding on the nature, tasks, and main goals of kindergartens in terms of childcare and education, the "Regulations" also provide specific provisions for kindergarten enrollment, class formation, health care, education, facilities, equipment, staff, funding, the relationship between kindergartens and families, and kindergarten management work.

This regulation is an important administrative rule for kindergarten management. Its issuance and implementation will promote kindergarten management work to gradually move towards scientific and institutionalized tracks.

    推动幼教事业科学化制度化
    《幼儿园工作规程》颁布
    本报北京7月26日讯　记者魏玉凤报道：国家教委颁布我国首部较完整的《幼儿园工作规程》，将于明年2月1日开始在全国试行。
    国家教委有关负责人在今天的新闻发布会上介绍说，长期以来，由于坚持在地方人民政府举办幼儿园的同时，动员和依靠社会各方面的力量多渠道、多形式办园的方针，我国的幼儿教育事业有很大发展。到去年底，全国共有各级各类幼儿园17.1万所，在园幼儿1854万人。但是，无论是幼儿园的数量还是质量，同社会主义现代化对提高劳动者和整个民族素质的要求还不相适应。
    这次颁布的《幼儿园工作规程》包括总则和附则，共分10章。
      《规程》除了对幼儿园的性质、任务，及保育、教育的主要目标进行了阐述外，还对幼儿园的招生、编班，卫生保健、教育、园舍、设备、工作人员、经费、幼儿园与家庭，幼儿园的管理工作等作了具体规定。
    这个规程是幼儿园管理的一项重要行政法规。它的颁布和实施，将促使幼儿园管理工作逐步走上科学化、制度化的轨道。
