Beijing's Liuyin Street military and civilian residents have been deeply engaged in joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization. Under the influence of the "New Breeze of Liuyin," people's ideological and moral standards have continuously improved. During the turmoil and riots in the capital, not a single resident, student, or wayward youth from this area participated. Marshal Xu praised, saying that the experience of Liuyin Street's military-civilian joint construction work is typical and demonstrates that as long as ideological and political work is strengthened in peacetime, it will show its power in critical moments.

Liuyin Street is a residential street in the Gangqiao area of Beijing's Xicheng District, with a population of 3,750. Under the warm care of Marshal Xu and with the help of the Beijing Garrison's certain regiment and local leaders, Liuyin Street's joint construction activities have always focused on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and doing good ideological work as the main line, propagating and educating the masses, and striving to improve people's political quality.

The military-civilian joint construction point in Liuyin Street has done a good job of ideological work among university students and wayward youths. Liuyin Street has 34 university students, of whom 13 are in Beijing colleges and universities, 1 is in an out-of-town college, and 20 are commuting students from other places who are temporarily staying in Liuyin Street. There are also 25 wayward youths. To prevent them from being drawn into the turmoil and riots, the joint construction leadership group visited each student's home, had family members persuade and educate them, and also met with each student individually, educating them to cherish their hard-earned learning opportunities and to repay the country with practical actions. In addition, letters were used to guide and educate students studying in other places. To prevent youths with past misdeeds from relapsing, the military-civilian joint construction leadership group held two meetings attended by school teachers, street officials, community police, resident representatives, and party cadres from various units, strengthening the remedial education team. They adopted methods of dividing by school and area, assigning responsibilities, and home visits to form a remedial education network. Due to the meticulous and solid ideological work, all 34 university students in the street did not participate in any parades, hunger strikes, sit-ins, or riots, and none of the 25 wayward youths participated in any disturbances or acts of vandalism.

    “柳荫新风”培育新一代
    徐帅赞扬军民共建活动在关键时刻显了威力
    本报讯　北京市柳荫街军民深入开展共建社会主义精神文明活动。在“柳荫新风”的熏陶下，人们的思想水平和道德水平不断提高。在首都发生学潮、动乱以至暴乱期间，这里所有居民、大学生和失足青年没有一个参与的。徐帅赞扬说，柳荫街军民共建工作的经验具有典型意义，它有力地说明了只要平时加强思想政治工作，关键时刻就会显示威力。
    柳荫街是北京市西城区厂桥地区的一条居民街，共有居民3750人。在徐帅的亲切关怀下，在北京卫戍区某团和地方领导的帮助下，柳荫街共建活动始终把坚持四项基本原则，做好思想工作，作为一条主线，宣传群众，教育群众，着力提高人的政治素质。
    柳荫街军民共建点认真做好大学生和失足青年的思想工作。柳荫街共有34名大学生，其中13名在北京市高校，1名在外地高校，还有20名是外地在柳荫街借宿的走读生。失足青年有25名。为防止他们裹入动乱和暴乱之中，共建领导小组对在本街道的大学生除一一进行家访、让家长做好说服教育外，还同大学生本人一一见了面，教育他们珍惜来之不易的学习机会，用实际行动报效祖国。此外，还利用书信，对在外地就学的大学生进行劝导和教育。为防止有过劣迹的青年旧病复发，军民共建领导小组先后两次召开了由学校老师、街道干部、管片民警、居民代表和连队领导等方面党员骨干参加的情况分析会，充实帮教队伍，采取分院划片、分头包干、入户教育的方法，形成帮教网络。由于思想工作细致、扎实，全街道34名大学生不仅没有一个参加游行、绝食、静坐和暴乱的，而且25名失足青年也没有一个参与闹事和打、砸、抢、烧的。
