The August First Film Studio has meticulously produced the revolutionary war historical epic "Great Kunlun," which will be released to the public on July 1st this year. This film is grand in scale and vividly recreates the historical scenes of Mao Zedong leading the Party Central Committee to voluntarily withdraw from Yan'an and fight in Shaanxi, defeating the Kuomintang's concentrated attacks. In terms of ideology, art, and other aspects, it has achieved considerable success, and there have been breakthroughs in the portrayal of revolutionary leaders. It is a film with new ideas and unique characteristics in the genre of major revolutionary historical themes. For this reason, it is an excellent film for educating the public on revolutionary history and tradition, providing contemporary Chinese citizens and youth with extremely valuable ideological enlightenment.

Epic – Grasping History from a Macro Perspective

As a visual textbook for Party history or for educating youth on revolutionary traditions, this film undoubtedly has its significance and role. However, as a movie and as a work of art, it should not be confined to a natural depiction of history but should stand at a higher historical vantage point to grasp history, examine events, and portray characters from a macro perspective. The creators of the film embraced this spirit in their production and indeed achieved this effect.

From March 1947 to March 1948, under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, the Party Central Committee withdrew from Yan'an and fought in Shaanxi, leading the nation's battlefields to continuously thwart the Kuomintang's rampant attacks, shifting the Liberation War from strategic defense to strategic offense. This arduous and glorious chapter of the Party's struggle is the film's central content. The film not only needs to depict major historical events and showcase the unique typical environment of characters' activities but also needs to fully portray and depict the creators of history. This is an epic film, with history and poetry. History needs no elaboration; poetry is not about small bridges, flowing water, or pastoral idylls but should be a reflection on history, a solemn, solemn, stirring, and tragic symphony, a lyrical and meaningful prose poem. Given the significance of the historical theme, it is appropriate to use a realistic narrative style. Within the principle of not deviating from the overall historical truth, the film made some artistic embellishments to present history more vividly to contemporary audiences.

The film's prelude is a lively conversation between Chairman Mao and Anna Louise Strong, which comprehensively summarizes the great significance and inevitable victory of the people's war, setting the tone for the entire film. This is a masterful approach. Subsequently, the film unfolds a grand and meticulous portrayal of that historical period. Vertically, the film clearly and undulatingly describes the battles of Qinglianggang, Yangmahe, Panlong, and Shajiadian, depicting the Kunlun Column's several encounters with danger but ultimately turning danger into opportunity and marching towards victory. Horizontally, the film, with the Party Central Committee's fighting in Shaanxi as the center, radiates outward to depict the coordination of battlefields across the country with the Northwest battlefield, showcasing the grand war that changed the fate of the Chinese people in a broader perspective. In addition to the leaders of the Central Political Bureau, the images of Peng Dehuai and Wang Zhen from the Northwest battlefield, Liu Bocheng and Deng Xiaoping advancing into the central plains, Chen Yi from the Shandong battlefield, as well as other military leaders such as He Long and Chen Geng, also appear on the screen. These precise treatments all reflect the filmmakers' macro grasp of history.

Without heavy depictions of war, it cannot be called a military epic. Therefore, the film pays special attention to the portrayal of the scale and atmosphere of the war, excelling in domestic films in this aspect. With the assistance of tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians, the film, whether in highlighting the momentum of large-scale battles or in depicting the atmosphere of local battlefields, has achieved good visual effects. For example, the ambush at Qinglianggang and the assault at Panlong are both shot with great momentum.

Characters – Making Leader Figures Vivid and Fleshed-Out

War-themed films must also focus on character development, a principle proven by countless creative practices. Films depicting major revolutionary historical themes must strive to portray leader figures well. Compared to past films like "Xi'an Incident," "Storm Over the Bell Tower," and "Four Crossings of the Red Water," "Great Kunlun" has reached a new height in portraying characters, especially the leaders of the Party and the military.

Although this film mainly depicts events, the creative focus is always on characters, especially the main character Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong's image has appeared multiple times on stage, screen, and television, and the idol-like image of universal adoration has become a thing of the past. Now, there is a need to portray characters at a deeper level, making them more vivid and lifelike. This requires not only life material but also a change in the creator's subjective consciousness, including the problem of directors and actors' ideological liberation, as there were many constraints in the portrayal of leader figures in the past. In reality, great men and ordinary people should be unified and coordinated, with no insurmountable chasm between them. In the film, the directors did not avoid this apparent contradiction. For example, in the film's prelude, Mao Zedong's dialogue with Strong showcases Chairman Mao's strategic vision: far-sighted, fearless in danger, magnanimous, and calm and confident. Correspondingly, in the film's epilogue, Mao Zedong, along with Zhou Enlai and Ren Bishi, stands atop the snow-capped Wutai Mountain, overlooking the mountains, foreshadowing the war's entry into a new phase and the opening of a new chapter in history, with the day of the People's Liberation Army drinking from the Yangtze River not far off. These all depict the leader's side as a great man, politician, and strategist. On the other hand, the leader as an ordinary person, with blood, flesh, and emotions, also inevitably reveals himself. When the Kunlun Column shook off the pursuers, and the national strategic situation underwent a fundamental turn in favor of the Party, Mao Zedong, overjoyed, hummed the Shaanxi folk song "Walking to the West" on horseback; facing the elderly and their grandchildren who offered a bowl of noodles made from seed grain for the war, Mao Zedong was overcome with emotion and tears; the film also depicts him running to the kitchen to find alcohol for the frontline's victory, his fond farewell to Mao Anying by the Yellow River, his issuing commands to his mount while on the march... These emotional changes and expressions of sentiment, these "trivial matters," make Mao Zedong, as a leader, more vivid and lifelike, bringing him closer to the people.

Worth mentioning is that in "Great Kunlun," Deng Xiaoping's image appears on the screen for the first time, drawing much attention. Although there are only two scenes where he decides to advance into Dabie Mountain with Liu Bocheng and leads his troops across the Huanghe floodplain, it still showcases Comrade Xiaoping's decisive and resolute decision-making.

The film focuses its main scenes on the Central Five, namely Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, and Ren Bishi. In addition to highlighting their outstanding military and political talents, it also depicts their comradeship, their disagreements, and debates. On the Kuomintang side, it focuses on Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, Gu Zutong, and Hu Zongnan. In portraying these upper-echelon antagonists, it strives to avoid superficiality and caricature, seeking to restore their historical true selves.

The actor Zhang Keyao, who plays Mao Zedong, has a good overall grasp of the role, with a sense of proportion and life. The actor Sun Feihu, who plays Chiang Kai-shek, portrays Chiang as a bourgeois politician, with a fairly accurate and believable depiction. The directors and actors focus on portraying characters based on historical truth and character traits, generally achieving a reasonable and true portrayal without arbitrary beautification or vilification. The film's experience in this aspect is worth summarizing and promoting.

Textbook – Let History Speak to the Future

The overall director of "Great Kunlun," Comrade He Guang, when discussing their filming intentions, said: Such a significant historical theme, he is deeply aware of the great difficulty in filming, but responsibility and duty make him duty-bound. He believes that if this film can evoke people's nostalgia for the past, cherish the present, and maintain and ignite the spirit of the war years while reviewing history; if it can make those who have not experienced that history understand and recognize the past, learn from the pioneering spirit of the older generation, and achieve something in today's reform tide, then their purpose in filming this film will be achieved.

Will people still be interested in a film reflecting the war history of 40 years ago? The answer should be affirmative. This film, of course, cannot directly provide answers to the political and social problems we face today, but it influences people's thinking and responses to current issues with a traditional force.

For example: Why do Deng Xiaoping and other old-generation revolutionaries repeatedly emphasize that adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles is the foundation of the state, and why do the vast majority of workers, peasants, and intellectuals across the country support this fundamental policy for building the country? Obviously, this requires a review of China's modern revolutionary war history, a review of how the Communist Party of China and the People's Liberation Army, with their sacrifices and struggles, won the birth of the People's Republic of China with the support of the masses. In the extremely arduous years of revolutionary war, it was Chairman Mao who issued the prophecy that "darkness is about to pass, and dawn is just ahead," and with extraordinary strategic talent, commanded and led the People's Liberation Army and the broad masses to win this people's liberation war. The Communist Party of China's loyalty to the motherland and its ability to lead the revolution to victory have been acknowledged by the nation through severe historical tests. "Great Kunlun" is an artistic and convincing portrayal of the above history and great truth, and it will certainly be welcomed by today's audience and gain the appropriate enlightenment from it.

In the film, Chairman Mao's inscription "Light Ahead" for the Yan'an orphanage shows a great revolutionary leader's foresight and firm grasp of the overall war situation. Our country and people now need leaders who can point out the direction for us in the midst of endless turmoil and firmly steer the ship of the republic towards victory. Facts have proven and will continue to prove that this leader is no one else but the long-tested Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and its leaders. We should still, like the military and civilians of the liberated areas 40 years ago, unite around the Party Central Committee, under the guidance of the spirit of the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee, strive for the bright future of socialist China.

    历史巨片　形象教材
    ——评影片《巍巍昆仑》
    宋君颖
    八一电影制片厂精心拍摄制作的革命战争历史巨片《巍巍昆仑》，于今年七一与广大观众见面。这部影片气势恢宏，真实地再现了毛泽东同志率领党中央主动撤离延安转战陕北，粉碎蒋军重点进攻的历史画面；在思想、艺术等方面都取得了相当可观成就，对革命领袖人物的塑造也有所突破，是一部很有新意和特色的重大革命历史题材影片。正由于此，它是一部进行革命历史、革命传统教育的好影片，它向当代中国公民及中国青年提供了极为宝贵的思想启示。
    史诗——从宏观上把握历史
    作为党史或者是对青年进行革命传统教育的形象教材，这部影片自有它无可置疑的意义与作用，但作为电影，作为艺术品，它又不能囿于对历史的自然写照，而应站在历史的更高角度，从宏观上把握历史、审视事件、表现人物。影片创作者正是抱着这种精神来拍摄影片的，他们也确实收到了这样的效果。
    1947年3月至1948年3月，以毛泽东主席为首的党中央撤离延安转战陕北，并领导全国各战场不断粉碎国民党的猖狂进攻，把解放战争由战略防御引入战略进攻。党中央艰难而光辉的这一段斗争史，是影片的中心内容。影片既要表现主要历史事件、展示人物活动的特殊的典型环境，还要充分塑造和描绘创造历史的人。这是一部史诗式的影片，有史，也要有诗。史，不必多说；诗，也不是什么小桥流水、田园牧歌，而应该是对历史的沉思，是一首庄严、凝重、激奋、悲壮的交响乐，一首富有情致、充满韵味的散文诗。由于是重大历史题材，所以适宜用现实主义的叙事性表现手法。影片在不违背总的历史真实的原则下，作了一些艺术虚构，使历史更为生动地展示在今人面前。
    影片的序幕，是毛主席与安娜·路易斯·斯特朗一段谈笑风生的谈话，高瞻远瞩地概括了人民战争的伟大意义和必胜前途，为整部影片提纲挈领，是大手笔的写法。此后，影片便展开了对那一段历史的大笔挥洒和精心刻画。从纵向上来说，影片相当清晰而起伏有致地描写了青化砭、羊马河、蟠龙、沙家店等战役，描写了昆仑纵队在与敌人的周旋中几经遇险但又都化险为夷，终于走向胜利的过程；从横向上来看，影片以转战陕北的党中央为中心，同时辐射式地展开表现全国各个战场对西北战场的配合，在更为宽广的视野上展示了那场转变中国人民命运的宏大战争。除中央政治局的领袖外，西北战场上的彭德怀、王震，挺进中原的刘伯承、邓小平，山东战场的陈毅，还有贺龙、陈赓等我军将领的形象，也跃然于银幕之上。这些精当的处理，都体现了编导者宏观地把握历史的匠心。
    离开了对战争的重笔描写就不能称为军事巨片。所以，影片特别注意了对战争规模气势的表现和战场气氛的渲染，在这方面，堪称国产影片之最。在成千上万名战士和群众的协助下，影片不论是在突出大兵团作战的气势下，还是在表现局部战场的气氛上，都收到了良好的视觉效果。如青化砭伏击战、蟠龙攻坚战等，都拍得很有气势。
    人物——让领袖形象血肉丰满
    战争题材影片也要注重写人，这个道理已为无数创作实践所证明。描写重大革命历史题材的影片，更要着力塑造好领袖人物。与过去拍摄的《西安事变》、《风雨下钟山》、《四渡赤水》等影片相比，《巍巍昆仑》在塑造人物特别是我党我军领袖人物方面，迈上了一个新的高度。
    这部影片虽然主要表现事件，但创作着眼点时刻对准了人物，尤其是对准主要人物毛泽东。毛泽东的形象以前在舞台上、银幕上、荧屏上多次出现过，那种万民崇拜的偶像式形象已成为过去，现在需要在更深层次上塑造人物，使之更生动、更生活化。这不仅需要有生活素材，还需要创造者主体意识的改变，其中包括导演和演员思想解放的问题，因为对领袖人物的塑造以前是有不少框框的。其实，伟人与常人应该是统一的，协调的，是没有一条不可逾越的鸿沟的。在影片中，编导者没有回避这一貌似矛盾的问题。如在影片的序幕，毛泽东与斯特朗的对话，表现了毛主席战略家的气派：高瞻远瞩、临危不惧、举止大度、冷静自信。与之相呼应的是影片的尾声，毛泽东与周恩来、任弼时登上白雪皑皑的五台山，毛泽东居高临下，俯视群山，预示战争将进入新阶段，历史将揭开新的一页，我军饮马长江的日子不远了。这都表现了领袖作为伟人、政治家和战略家的一面。而另一方面，领袖作为常人，作为有血有肉有感情的普通人，也难免有时会流露出来。昆仑纵队甩掉了追兵，全国战略形势发生了有利于我的根本转变，毛泽东高兴地情不自禁在马上哼起了陕北民歌《走西口》；面对为战争献出老伴与儿子的老妇幼孙和他们捧上的一碗用种籽粮做成的白面条，毛泽东悲感交集，潸然泪下；影片中还写他为前方的胜利高兴，自己跑到厨房找酒喝，写他黄河边与毛岸英惜别时的依依父子情，写他行军途中对着坐骑传口令……这些情绪的变化，感情的流露，这些“凡人小事”，使作为领袖的毛泽东更加血肉丰满，与群众靠得更近。
    值得一提的是，在《巍巍昆仑》中，邓小平同志的形象第一次出现在故事片银幕上，十分引人注目。虽然只有与刘伯承同志一起决定挺进大别山和率领部队过黄泛区两场戏，但仍然表现出小平同志决策的果断和坚毅。
    影片把主要画面集中在中央五书记，即毛泽东、周恩来、朱德、刘少奇、任弼时身上。在着力表现他们杰出的军事、政治才干之外，也写了他们之间的同志之情，写他们之间的分歧、争论。国民党方面则集中写了蒋介石、宋美龄、顾祝同、胡宗南等。在表现这些上层反面人物时力求克服表面化、脸谱化，务求恢复其历史的真实面目。
    扮演毛泽东的演员张克瑶对角色总体把握准确，既有分寸感，又有生活。扮演蒋介石的孙飞虎把蒋介石，作为一个资产阶级政治家来表现，刻画也比较准确，真实可信。编导和演员注重从历史真实及角色性格出发来表现人物，基本上做到了合理真实而不随意美化或丑化。影片在这方面的经验，值得总结并发扬。
    教材——让历史告诉未来
    《巍巍昆仑》的总导演郝光同志在谈到他们的拍摄意图时说：这样重大的历史题材，他深知拍摄难度很大，但责任和义务又使他义不容辞。他认为，如果这部影片能唤起人们对过去的怀念，对今天的珍惜，在重温历史的过程中保持和焕发战争年代的某种精神；能使未经历过那段历史的人了解和认识过去，学习老一辈的创业精神，在今天的改革大潮中有所作为，那么，他们拍摄这部影片的目的也就达到了。
    当前，人们还会对一部反映40年前的战争历史的影片感到兴趣吗？答复应该是肯定的。这部影片当然不可能为我们当前所面对的那些政治和社会问题提供直接的答案，但是它却以一种传统的力量影响着人们对当前问题的思考和答复。
    比如：为什么邓小平等老一代革命家要一而再、再而三地强调坚持四项基本原则是立国之本，而全国绝大多数的工人、农民、知识分子也拥护这个建设国家的根本方针呢？显然，这就需要追述一下中国的近代现代革命战争的历史，需要回顾一下中国共产党和中国人民解放军是怎样用自己的牺牲奋斗在人民群众的支援下赢得了中华人民共和国的诞生的。在非常艰苦的革命战争年代，是毛泽东主席发出了“黑暗即将过去，曙光即在前头”的预言，并用非凡的战略雄才指挥统率人民解放军和广大人民赢得了这场人民解放战争。中国共产党对祖国人民的忠诚及领导革命走向胜利的能力就是经历了严峻的历史考验而赢得全国人民的承认的。《巍巍昆仑》这部影片正是对于上述历史的结论和伟大的真理的艺术化的表现和令人信服的描述，当然会受到今天的观众的欢迎，并从中获得应有的启示。
    在影片中，毛泽东主席为保育院题字“光明在前”，表现出一位伟大的革命领导人对于形势发展的远见和对于整个战争局势的坚强把握能力。我们的祖国和人民现在多么需要能在纷扰不已的动乱形势下为我们指出方向并切实掌握共和国的航船向着胜利的航向前进的领导者啊！事实已经证明并将继续证明，这个领导者不是别人，还是久经考验的中国共产党中央及其领袖。我们仍然应该像40年前解放区的军民一样，团结在党中央的周围，在党的十三届四中全会精神的指引下，为争取社会主义祖国的光明前途而努力奋斗。（附图片）
