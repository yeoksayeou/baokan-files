Xinhua News Agency, Addis Ababa, July 26th.

The 25th Summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) concluded here tonight. The summit elected Tanzania's Vice President Salim as the new Secretary-General of the OAU and adopted several resolutions, including a declaration on the situation in Namibia, the establishment of an African Economic Community, and the resolution of Africa's debt problems.

The declaration on Namibia calls on the United Nations to take measures to ensure that free and fair elections are held in Namibia in early November. The declaration states that reducing the UN peacekeeping force from the originally planned 7,500 to 4,650 is insufficient to guarantee the minimum conditions required for holding free and fair elections.

The declaration condemns the South African authorities for incorporating their riot police stationed in Namibia into the Southwest African Police Organization and directing them to intimidate and use violence against members of the Southwest African People's Organization. It demands that the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative in Namibia immediately disband the riot police.

Regarding the establishment of the African Economic Community, the resolution calls for accelerating the creation of the proposed African Economic Community to achieve collective self-reliance in Africa's economic and social development. The resolution reaffirms the principles and goals of promoting and strengthening cooperation and economic integration among African countries and calls for the reimplementation of the Lagos Plan of Action for the Development of Africa, adopted in 1980.

The resolution urges the OAU Secretariat, the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, and the African Development Bank to coordinate their human and financial resources to promote the process of establishing an African Common Market. The resolution also calls on African countries to coordinate and streamline the activities of regional economic cooperation organizations in Africa to contribute to the eventual establishment of the African Economic Community.

The new Chairman of the OAU, Egyptian President Mubarak, praised the participants for completing their mission with a "sense of responsibility" at the closing meeting. He said that the world is going through a serious period, and Africa will participate in the process of change according to its own principles and interests.

He said that this summit agreed to take action to resolve Africa's political problems. Leaders of some African countries will soon meet in Harare to discuss the issue of apartheid. The summit agreed to closely monitor the developments in Namibia. He said that the OAU will redouble its efforts to resolve the conflict between Chad and Libya in a peaceful and just manner. The OAU will form a committee led by the OAU Chairman to mediate the disputes between Mauritania and Senegal.

He hopes that Morocco will soon return to the OAU. The newly elected Secretary-General of the OAU, Salim, has taken the oath of office.

    非统组织首脑会议闭幕
    会议通过关于纳米比亚形势宣言
    谋求建立非共体和解决债务问题
    据新华社亚的斯亚贝巴7月26日电　非洲统一组织第25届首脑会议今晚在这里闭幕。会议选举坦桑尼亚副总理萨利姆为非统组织秘书长，并通过了关于纳米比亚形势的宣言、建立非洲经济共同体、解决非洲债务问题等多项决议。
    关于纳米比亚的宣言，要求联合国采取措施以确保纳米比亚11月上旬举行自由公正的选举。
    宣言认为，联合国维持和平部队从原来规定的7500人减少到4650人不足以保证举行自由公正选举所需要的最低条件。
    宣言谴责南非当局把其驻纳的防暴警察部队归入西南非洲警察组织并指使他们对西南非洲人民组织成员采取恐吓和暴力的行径，要求联合国秘书长驻纳米比亚特别代表立即解散防暴警察部队。
    关于建立非洲经济共同体的决议要求加快建立拟议中的非洲经济共同体，实现非洲经济、社会发展方面集体自立更生的目标。
    决议说，与会首脑重申了促进和加强非洲国家间合作和经济一体化的原则和目标，要求重新执行1980年通过的关于非洲经济发展的拉各斯行动计划。
    决议要求非统组织秘书处、联合国非洲经济委员会和非洲开发银行协调它们的人力和财力，以促进建立非洲共同市场的进程。
    决议还呼吁非洲各国协调和理顺非洲地区性经济合作组织的活动，以便为最终建立非洲经济共同体作出贡献。
    非统组织新任主席、埃及总统穆巴拉克在闭幕会议上赞扬与会者以“承担义务的精神”完成了他们的使命。
    他说，世界正经历着一个严峻的时期，非洲将根据自己的原则和利益参与变革的进程。
    他说，本届首脑会议同意采取行动解决非洲的政治问题。一些非洲国家领导人不久将在哈拉雷开会，讨论种族隔离制度问题。首脑会议同意密切注视纳米比亚局势的发展。
    他说，非统组织将加紧努力，以和平和公正的方式解决乍得和利比亚冲突。非统组织将组成以非统组织主席为领导的委员会，调解毛里塔尼亚和塞内加尔之间的矛盾。
    他希望摩洛哥不久将返回非统组织。
    新当选的非统组织秘书长萨利姆已宣誓就职。
