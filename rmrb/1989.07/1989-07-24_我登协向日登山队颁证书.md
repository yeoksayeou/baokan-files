The Chinese Mountaineering Association held a reception in the Anhui Hall of the Great Hall of the People this evening to celebrate the success of the Kyoto Prefecture Karakoram Club Public Peak Climbing Team in reaching the summit. The association also awarded certificates to the climbing team and the summit climbers.

The nine members of the Japanese Kyoto Public Peak Climbing Team successfully scaled the 7,719-meter Public Peak from the north slope in two groups on July 11. This was the first time humans had conquered Public Peak from the north slope.

From June to August 1981, the Japanese Kyoto Public Peak Climbing Team first attempted to climb Public Peak from the north slope but failed, and three team members went missing. After that, they prepared for eight years.

After expressing warm congratulations to the Japanese Kyoto Climbing Team, Chairman Shi Zhanchun of the Chinese Mountaineering Association presented the summit success certificate to the Japanese Kyoto Public Peak Climbing Team on behalf of the Chinese Mountaineering Association. Huang Zhong, Vice Chairman of the All-China Sports Federation, also presented summit certificates to the summit climbers.
