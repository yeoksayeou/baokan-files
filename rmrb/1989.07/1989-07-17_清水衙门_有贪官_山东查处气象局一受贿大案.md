    Corruption in the "Clean Department": Shandong Investigates a Major Bribery Case in the Meteorological Bureau
    Our reporter Jiā Jiànzhōu reports: The Tianqiao District People's Procuratorate in Jinan uncovered a serious economic crime case from the Shandong Provincial Meteorological Bureau, which is often seen as a "clean department." The criminals Liu De Xiang, Shen Tao, and Ye Kunying have been arrested according to law.

    In mid-May of this year, while investigating the case of Gao Shudong, an accountant from the Financial and Planning Department of the Shandong Provincial Meteorological Bureau, for misappropriating public funds, the Tianqiao District People's Procuratorate discovered that the department head, Liu De Xiang, had accepted bribes. They then organized a team to conduct a thorough investigation and discovered that this group of criminals had, since 1986, sold over 100 tons of steel materials, allocated by the state to the Shandong Provincial Meteorological Bureau, to illegal elements in society, embezzling and accepting bribes totaling over 100,000 yuan. According to preliminary investigations, Liu De Xiang, who joined the revolution in 1946 and the party in 1950, and is the head of the Financial and Planning Department of the Meteorological Bureau, accepted bribes totaling over 5,000 yuan; the deputy section chief, Shen Tao, accepted bribes totaling over 12,000 yuan; the section chief and warehouse keeper, Ye Kunying, embezzled and accepted bribes totaling over 11,000 yuan; the party member and administrative staff, Wang Jian Guo, accepted bribes totaling over 5,300 yuan.
