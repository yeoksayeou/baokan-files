The director of the National Cancer Center of Japan, Takashi Sugimura, believes that by the 21st century, due to the restriction of known chemical carcinogens, occupational cancers such as lung cancer caused by asbestos and liver cancer caused by polyvinyl chloride resin will be the first to disappear. Additionally, the incidence of lung cancer caused by tobacco will decrease as the number of smokers decreases. Therefore, the incidence of cancer in the 21st century will be reduced by one-third.

At that time, diagnostic technology will have made significant progress. Five years ago, people were already able to use ultrasound to detect cancer nests with a diameter of one centimeter. In the future, it is planned to further develop nuclear magnetic resonance microscopes to accurately distinguish between small cancer cells and normal cells.

In terms of surgical progress, there will be radiation therapy for cancer patients, and to prevent cancer metastasis or recurrence, long-acting, slow-release anti-cancer drugs will be implanted in the body. Additionally, new therapies will be tried, such as preserving one's own bone marrow stem cells for autologous transplantation and culturing the patient's T cells with killing power outside the body. In the near future, organ transplantation will definitely be a boon for patients with primary liver cancer.

On the other hand, in the study of cancer genes that cause cancer, in addition to the more than 40 types already discovered, new anti-cancer genes have been extracted. However, the current issue is that cancer genes do not individually transform normal cells into cancer cells, but rather multiple cancer genes work together to cause changes. This research will make significant progress in the next ten years.

The two main problems that need to be solved in the future are cancer metastasis and the resistance of cancer cells to multiple drugs. It is generally believed that understanding the structure of colorectal cancer transforming into liver cancer and the genes involved in metastasis will take about ten years, followed by solving the problem of drug resistance to cancer changes, that is, resistance to multiple drugs. Recent research has shown that cancer cells have proteins that act like pumps to expel drugs. Thus, the study of cancer gene structures has taken another step forward.

    何时才能攻克癌症
    日本国立癌症研究中心总长杉村隆认为，到二十一世纪，由于已知的化学致癌物质的使用受到限制，因职业引发的癌症，如由于石棉引起的肺癌、氯乙烯树脂引起的肝癌等将首先消失。还有，由烟草引起的肺癌患病率将因吸烟者减少而降低。因此二十一世纪癌症发病率将会减少三分之一。
    那时有关诊断技术将相当进步。五年前人们已能够用超声波来检查直径一厘米的癌巢，今后计划进一步开发出核磁共振显微镜，达到正确分辨出微小的癌细胞与正常细胞。
    手术方面的进步有对癌症患者进行放射性治疗，为防止癌转移或再发生而在体内埋植长效、慢释放性抗癌剂等。还有试运用新疗法，保存自己骨髓干细胞进行自体移植和体外繁殖患者的具有杀伤力的T细胞。不远的将来，内脏器官移植一定会成为原发性肝癌患者的福音。
    另一方面，在探明癌化结构的癌基因研究中，除目前已发现四十余种外，还提取出了新的抗癌基因。可是现在的课题为癌基因不是单独将正常细胞癌化，而是由复数癌基因联合后发生变化的。这项研究在今后十年会有相当进展。
    今后需要解决的难题主要有两个：一是癌转移，另一为癌细胞对多种药物的耐性。一般认为，弄清从大肠癌转变为肝癌的结构以及转移的基因似乎也要十年时间，然后是解决投放药物对癌病变无效，即对多种药物的耐性问题。最近的研究表明：癌细胞中具有象抽水泵那样把药剂汲出的蛋白质。这样对癌基因构造的研究又前进了一步。
