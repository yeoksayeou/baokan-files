Hunan Prosecutors Severely Punish Corruption and Bribery
Over 1,400 Cases Investigated in Half a Year

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 23rd - Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: Hunan Province's prosecutors have been severely cracking down on economic crimes, particularly focusing on corruption and bribery. In the first half of this year, they have investigated over 2,000 economic crime cases, including more than 1,400 cases of corruption and bribery, recovering economic losses amounting to 10.06 million yuan.

This year, Hunan's prosecutors have strengthened their reporting mechanisms and coordinated with various departments, including the disciplinary inspection commissions, supervision, commerce, and taxation departments, to ensure that channels for reporting corruption and bribery are open. This has helped to break through previous blind spots in the fight against economic crimes. Party and government agencies, as well as large enterprises, which had been weak links in the fight against economic crimes in the past few years, have seen significant progress. The financial and supply systems, which had not been deeply affected, have also seen improvements. The Xiangjiang Cement Factory, one of the 98 large enterprises in the country, has been evaluated as an advanced unit at the provincial and municipal levels for many years. In March, based on public reports, the prosecutors of Xiangtan City and Xiangxiang City led a team of 12 officials to the factory to investigate. By the end of June, they had uncovered 7 cases of bribery, including 4 major cases involving 4 individuals with amounts over 10,000 yuan each. In the first half of this year, the provincial prosecutors investigated 515 major and significant cases involving county-level and above officials, accounting for 25% of the total cases. Among these, 35 cases involved county-level and above officials accused of major corruption and bribery.

In February, the Bantang District Prosecutor's Office in Xiangtan City discovered that some officials in a certain military factory within their jurisdiction were using their positions to sell steel at high prices and embezzle public funds. The leadership of the prosecutor's office personally handled the case, tracing it back to its source, and uncovered 23 criminals in the factory. They found that the amount of embezzlement and bribery totaled over 200,000 yuan. Among these criminals, there were 2 deputy ministerial-level officials, 4 division-level officials, and 6 section-level officials.

    湖南检察机关严惩贪污受贿
    半年立案侦查一千四百多起
    本报长沙7月23日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省各级检察机关严惩以贪污、受贿为重点的经济犯罪活动，今年上半年，已立案侦查各类经济罪案2000多件，其中贪污、受贿案件1400多起，挽回经济损失1006万元。
    今年以来湖南各级检察机关通过加强举报工作和与各级纪委、监察、工商、税务等部门的通气联络工作，确保了反贪污、反受贿案源渠道畅通，突破过去一段时期来打击经济犯罪的“死角”、“死面”。党政机关、大型企业，过去几年一直是湖南打击经济犯罪中的薄弱环节；金融系统、供销系统触动的程度也不深。这些“死角”、“死面”都有不同程度的突破。湘乡水泥厂，是全国98个大型企业之一，历年都被评为省、市先进单位。今年3月根据群众的举报，湘潭市和湘乡市检察院的检察长带领12名干部驻厂办案，到6月底，已立受贿案7件，其中万元以上的大案4件4人。今年上半年，全省检察机关立案侦查的万元以上和县处级以上干部犯罪的大案、要案515件，占立案总数的25％。其中立案查处县处级以上干部贪污、受贿要案35件35人。今年2月，湘潭市板塘区检察院发现辖区内的某部队工厂一些负责干部利用职务之便，高价倒卖平价钢材、私分公款等。该院领导亲自动手，顺藤摸瓜，在这个厂挖出犯罪分子23名，查出贪污、索贿受贿金额共20多万元。这些犯罪分子中，有副厅级干部2人，处级干部4人，科级干部6人。
