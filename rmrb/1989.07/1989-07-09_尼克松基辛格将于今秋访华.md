People's Daily, Washington, July 8th - Reporter Cang Lide reports: In the early 1970s, former U.S. President Nixon and former Secretary of State Kissinger will visit China this fall. According to reports from here, this will be the first visit by prominent Americans to China since the recent turmoil.

Nixon is expected to visit China in September, which will be his fifth trip to China since he resigned as President in 1974. On June 25, Nixon published an article in the Los Angeles Times opposing U.S. sanctions against China and suggesting that the authorities "use unofficial channels" to convey a message to Chinese leaders to "exercise restraint." However, he did not specify whether he himself hopes to serve as this "unofficial channel."

Dr. Kissinger, in a telephone interview with American journalists, said he is considering visiting China in early October to attend an investment organization conference initiated by the Chinese government. If that does not work out, he may go to China in November. Kissinger expressed his opposition to the recent House of Representatives' resolution to impose economic sanctions on China.

On June 20, President Bush ordered a halt to visits by high-level U.S. officials to China, but this only applies to government administrative officials.

    尼克松基辛格将于今秋访华
    本报华盛顿7月8日电  记者仓立德报道：70年代初为美国叩开中国大门的美国前总统尼克松及前国务卿基辛格将于今秋分别访问中国。据此间报道，这将是中国最近发生动乱后首批访华的美国著名人士。
    尼克松预计于9月访华，这将是他1974年辞去总统职务后第五次前往中国。6月25日尼克松曾在《洛杉矶时报》发表文章，反对美国制裁中国，并建议当局“通过非官方渠道”转达请中国领导人“表现克制”的信息。但他未说明自己是否希望充当这一“非官方渠道”。
    基辛格博士在接受美国记者的电话采访时表示，他考虑在10月上旬访华，以便参加由中国政府发起的投资组织会议。如果不能成行，他可能于11月前往中国。基辛格表示反对众议院最近通过的经济制裁中国的决议。
    布什总统6月20日下令停止美国高级官员访问中国，但只限于政府的行政官员。
