The Three Kingdoms Romance Dictionary is a comprehensive dictionary centered around the novel "The Three Kingdoms." The book contains over 4,800 entries and 960,000 characters, divided into seven main sections:

1. **Origins and Content**: This section includes "Origins" (which introduces various aspects related to the creation of "The Three Kingdoms"), "Characters," and "Plotlines." The "Characters" section not only introduces all the characters in "The Three Kingdoms" but also provides brief verifications for many of them. For example, it clarifies that the Eastern Wu official Qiao Guolao is not the same person as the Eastern Han official Qiao Xuan; the name of Sun Quan's wife is not Sun Shangxiang. Regarding "Plotlines," the book also offers many discussions, such as: "Whipping the Supervisor" was actually done by Liu Bei, "Capturing and Releasing Cao Cao" has nothing to do with Chen Gong, "Beheading Hua Xiong" was originally the deed of Sun Jian, and "Passing Through Five Passes and Slaying Six Generals" is purely a work of artistic fiction. Understanding these points can help better grasp the artistic features of "The Three Kingdoms."

2. **Historical Knowledge**: This section introduces various anecdotes, official titles, geography, astronomy, weapons, and etiquette mentioned in "The Three Kingdoms."

    《三国演义辞典》
    《三国演义辞典》是一部以《三国演义》为中心的综合性辞典。全书共收4800多个辞条、96万字，分为渊源与内容等7大部分：
    渊源与内容。包括“渊源”
  （介绍与《三国演义》成书过程有关的各种内容）、“人物”、“情节”三个部分。“人物”部分不仅介绍了《三国演义》中的所有人物，而且对许多人物作了简要的考证。如东吴乔国老与东汉太尉桥玄并非一人；孙夫人的名字也不是孙尚香……对于“情节”，本书也作了不少考辨，例如：“鞭督邮”本系刘备所为，“捉放曹”与陈宫无关，“斩华雄”原为孙坚之功，“过五关斩六将”纯属艺术虚构……了解这些，自可更好地把握《三国演义》的艺术特点。
    历史常识。介绍《三国演义》所涉及的典故、职官、地理、天文、兵器、礼仪等。
    改编与再创作。介绍根据《三国演义》改编或受其影响而创作的各种文艺作品。
