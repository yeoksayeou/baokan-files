Do rural people not know "every grain is the result of hard work"? Those who raise this question probably think that the poem "Treat the Fields with Respect" from the Tang Dynasty in China is only meaningful to urban dwellers who do not farm. This understanding is obviously one-sided.

Knowledge comes from practice. If you do not "work in the fields under the scorching sun" and personally experience the sweat dripping onto the soil, even if you know where the food on your plate comes from, you may not deeply understand the meaning of "every grain is the result of hard work." This is not an exaggeration. In some rural areas of China, where mechanization is relatively advanced, farmers have been freed from heavy physical labor and rarely need to weed or loosen the soil for crops. In some places, township enterprises have emerged, and a large number of laborers have left the land and even their hometowns. Many rural youths, upon graduating from school, enter factories and barely come into contact with heavy labor like weeding. In a sense, they are no different from urban dwellers who do not farm and need to receive the education of "who knows where the food on the plate comes from, every grain is the result of hard work."

In contrast, the older generation of farmers, who have long been engaged in arduous agricultural labor, have experienced the contrast between the old and new societies. They understand that every grain of food is hard-earned and have a personal understanding of "every grain is the result of hard work." Of course, understanding needs to be deepened through continuous practice. As production develops, should we continue to insist on meticulous harvesting and storing every grain? As living standards improve, should we still live frugally and save and cherish food? With prices not yet rationalized, is grain not valuable in the market? Does this change its status as a precious resource in a country like ours with a large population and limited land?... Seriously considering these questions has practical significance for every Chinese person today, whether they live in the city or the countryside.

Understanding "every grain is the result of hard work" in one's heart, but not practicing it by cherishing food and even wasting it without realizing it; for example, an old lady feeding chickens by scattering grains in handfuls, this is a fairly common phenomenon in life. To save food, in addition to persistent and detailed ideological education, we also need to popularize scientific knowledge and promote advanced technology.

The problem of grain waste in rural areas, as seen from the materials of Shengshui County, is mainly due to the lack of modern scientific and technological knowledge and the lack of more advanced processing and management technologies and equipment. This poses a new task for the vast number of rural workers: how to accelerate technological progress in rural areas, including grain production, processing, and management. We must effectively promote the use of wasteland and slopes, vigorously develop energy-saving livestock and poultry industries, and at the same time promote the use of compound feed and feed additives to solve the long-standing habit of feeding livestock and poultry with raw grains; help farmers master the technical skills of grain processing and storage, and reduce grain losses as much as possible.

### 乡下人不知“粒粒皆辛苦”？

    乡下人不知“粒粒皆辛苦”？
    万兴
    难道乡下人也不知“粒粒皆辛苦”？提出这样疑问的同志，大概以为我国唐代那篇题为《悯农》的诗篇，仅仅对不种田的城里人有着教育意义。这样理解显然是片面的。
    认识来源于实践。你不“锄禾日当午”，亲身经历一番“汗滴禾下土”，即使知道“盘中餐”哪里来的，也未免能深切体会到“粒粒皆辛苦”的滋味。这并非夸大之词。在我国农村，少数机械化比较发达的地区，农民已从笨重的体力劳动中解脱出来，很少为禾苗锄草松土了；一些地方乡镇企业异军突起，大批劳动力离土甚至离乡，不少农家子弟刚离学校门就进了工厂门，基本上不接触“锄禾”一类的繁重劳动。某种意义上讲，他们跟不种田的城里人没有什么区别，很有必要接受“谁知盘中餐，粒粒皆辛苦”的节俭教育。
    相比之下，老一辈农民长期从事艰苦的农业劳动，曾经历过新旧两种社会的对比，他们懂得每一粒粮食来之不易，对“粒粒皆辛苦”有着切身的感受。当然，认识有待于在不断的实践中深化。生产发展了，精收细打、颗粒归仓要不要坚持？生活改善了，是不是还得从紧过日子，节约和珍惜粮食？物价暂时没有理顺，粮食在市场上不值钱，这是否就改变了它在我们这样一个人多地少的国家中所应处的宝中之宝的地位？……认真思考这些问题，对于我们今天每一个中国人，无论他生活在城里还是乡下，都有着现实意义。
    心里明白“粒粒皆辛苦”，实践中却不去珍惜粮食、甚至仍在大量浪费还不觉得；例如老太太喂鸡，大把大把地撒米，这在生活中已是相当普遍存在的现象。节约粮食，除坚持深入细致的思想教育之外，我们还要靠普及科学知识，推广先进技术。
    农村粮食浪费问题，从响水县的材料看，其中很主要的原因，是缺乏现代科学技术知识，缺乏较为进步的加工和管理技术和设备所致。这就为广大的农村工作者提出新的工作任务：如何加快农村的技术进步，包括粮食生产、加工和管理。要切实抓好利用荒滩、荒坡，大力发展节能型畜禽业，同时推广使用配合饲料和饲料添加剂，解决长期形成的用原粮喂养畜禽的旧习惯；帮助农民掌握粮食加工、贮存等方面的技术要领，尽量减少粮食损耗。
