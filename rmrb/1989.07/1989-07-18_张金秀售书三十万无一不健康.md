Zhang Jinxiu, a retired teacher from Mawei Primary School in Muyuan Township, Mengcheng County, Anhui Province, has been employed as a book distributor since 1985. He has sold over 350,000 books to factories, rural areas, schools, military camps, and neighborhoods, ensuring that not a single unhealthy book was sold. He is renowned as a dedicated promoter of spiritual civilization.

The 64-year-old Zhang Jinxiu believes that book distribution is a crucial task in spreading socialist spiritual civilization. Therefore, he strictly refuses to sell books containing pornographic, obscene, or violent content, as well as other illegal publications.

Once, a young man from out of town, who was on a business trip, asked Zhang Jinxiu to help him buy a few stimulating erotic novels to satisfy his curiosity. The young man even offered to pay more money and promised to keep it a secret, assuring Zhang Jinxiu that no one would know he sold the books.

Zhang Jinxiu not only refused to help but also sternly criticized the young man, saying, "Reading such books is not good for young people; it is detrimental to their physical and mental health!" He then recommended a selection of healthy and beneficial books for the young man to choose from. With Zhang Jinxiu's help, the young man ended up purchasing books such as "Public Relations" and "Psychology of Love."

    张金秀售书三十万无一不健康
    新华社合肥7月18日电  （通讯员马在民）安徽省蒙城县移村乡马圩小学离休教师张金秀，自1985年被聘为图书发行员以来，到工厂、农村、学校、军营、街道先后售书35万余册，没有一本不健康的书，被誉为传播精神文明的热心人。
    今年64岁的张金秀认为，图书发行是一项传播社会主义精神文明的工作，因此对有色情、淫秽、暴力等不健康内容的书和其他非法出版物，坚持一本也不出售。
    一次，一个从外地出差来的年轻人，要他帮买几本有刺激性的看了过瘾的黄色故事书，并称“你要多少钱，给多少钱，还给你保密，不说是你卖的。”
    张金秀不仅不帮买，还严肃地批评那青年说，年轻人看那种书不好，不利于身心健康！并推荐一批健康有益的图书给这个年轻人挑选。那年轻人在他的帮助下，选购了《公共关系学》和《爱情心理学》等书。
