In May of this year, at the grand gathering of the "National Revival of Evaluation Drama Exchange Performance," Zhao Deping, director of the Dacang County Evaluation Drama Troupe in Hebei Province and a peasant playwright, won the "Excellent Scriptwriter Award."

Over the past five years, Zhao Deping has produced one new play each year, each with new tricks, each attracting audiences, and each adapted for film and television. Like a diligent bee, he continually strives and pursues: seeking realism in materials, innovation in ideas, clarity in atmosphere, refinement in writing, and strangeness in imagination. Finally, Zhao Deping has carved out a truly unique space for himself on China's stage.

This space is free from the noise of big cities, the pollution of heavy industry, the dazzling colors, the profound and mysterious philosophy, and the traditional style of classical theater. Instead, it offers a gentle breeze, a pair of green willows, the love between a husband and wife in a garden, and the tears of a young girl in the wilderness.

However, in his artistic world, there lives a group of true farmers. These ordinary people are not perfect, nor are they strong. They bear the marks of the old era and old ideas, but they yearn for change, seek new life, and strongly resist the status quo. These characters were originally Zhao Deping's friends, neighbors, or fellow villagers, but they were brought to life by the playwright's humorous and witty pen, infused with spirit and charm, and finally stepped onto the stage to have heart-to-heart conversations with the audience. They seem to have a magical power that binds Zhao Deping, the evaluation drama, and the villagers together. For over five years, the Dacang Evaluation Drama Troupe has continuously performed five modern plays by Zhao Deping, with over a thousand performances, attracting over a million viewers, and generating over 500,000 yuan in pure income.

From a local youth with only a junior high school education to today's first-class scriptwriter, member of the Chinese Dramatists Association, and vice-chairman of the Hebei Dramatists Association, Zhao Deping has walked a tough and arduous path. At the ages of 16 and 17, his parents passed away, forcing him to drop out of school and take up the hoe. However, his rough fate did not make him abandon his pursuit of art. He devoted all his energy to amateur literary creation in the countryside. Eventually, the vibrant cultural life in his hometown caught the attention of the county cultural center, and Zhao Deping was temporarily assigned to the creation group of the county cultural center as a temporary worker. In 1982, Zhao Deping took over as the director of the county evaluation drama troupe. He made three major changes: organizing and reforming management, strictly enforcing rules and regulations, and running the troupe with vigor, which also provided him with a valuable experimental base for his creation.

Dacang has produced a Zhao Deping. He not only writes plays but also has his own unique style. His career is like the evaluation drama troupe's "big wagon" driving towards the vast green fields, carrying hope and light, because it is deeply rooted in the hearts of the villagers.

    戏戏出新招
    ——记河北大厂县评剧团团长赵德平
    韩冬　张玉华
    今年5月，在群星荟萃的“全国振兴评剧交流演出”的盛会上，河北省大厂回族自治县评剧团团长、农民剧作家赵德平荣获了“优秀编剧奖”。
    5年来，赵德平一年一出戏，戏戏出新招，戏戏有观众，戏戏上影视。他像一只勤劳的蜜蜂似地不断进取，不断追求：素材求实，构思求新，意境求明，笔触求细，想象求奇……终于，赵德平在中国的剧坛上开拓出了一片真正属于他自己的绿油油的土地。
    这片土地没有大城市的喧嚣，没有大工业的污染，没有五光十色眩目的色彩，没有高深莫测玄秘的哲理，没有袍带笏板传统戏的风范。有的只是一丝清风，两行绿柳，瓜田李下夫妻情，荒郊陌野少女泪……
    然而，在他的艺术天地里却生活着一群真正的庄稼汉。那些普普通通的人物，不是完人，也不是强者，他们的身上有旧时代旧观念的烙印；但他们企盼着变革，渴求着新生，强烈地不安于现状。这些人物，原本是赵德平的朋友、邻居或乡亲，但他们被剧作家那支幽默、调侃的笔画出了灵气，画出了神韵，终于走上了舞台，和观众们推心置腹，促膝谈心。他们仿佛有一股神奇的力量，把赵德平、评剧、乡亲们紧紧地联系在一起。5年多了，大厂评剧团连续上演了赵德平的五出现代戏，演出场次超千场，观众人次过百万，经济纯收入50多万元。
    从一个土生土长，只有初中文化程度的农村青年，到今天的一级编剧、中国剧协理事、河北省剧协副主席，赵德平走过了一段艰苦奋斗的道路。他16、17岁时，父母相继去逝，不得不含泪辍学握起了锄把子。然而，坎坷的命运并没有使他放弃对艺术的顽强追求，他把自己全部精力投入到农村业余文艺创作事业中。终于，家乡红红火火的文化生活引起了县文化馆的注意，赵德平以临时工名义借调到县文化馆创作组。1982年，赵德平出任县评剧团团长，他上台三把火，组织整顿、改革经营管理，严格规章制度，把剧团办得虎虎有生气，也使得自己的创作有了宝贵的实验基地。
    大厂出了个赵德平，他不仅自己写戏，自身也有戏，他的事业，有如那正在驶向茫茫绿野的评剧团的“大篷车”一般，载着希望，载着光明，因为它紧贴在乡亲们的心窝里。（附图片）
