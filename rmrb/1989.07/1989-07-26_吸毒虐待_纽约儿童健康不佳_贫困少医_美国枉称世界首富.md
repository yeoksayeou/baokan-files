    Drug Abuse and Abuse: New York Children's Health in Danger
    Poverty and Lack of Medical Care: The United States, Supposedly the World's Richest Country

    Our reporter in Washington, July 24th: According to a report on children's health in New York City, the health of New York City's children is poor, and a series of medical and social problems are threatening the future of an entire generation of impoverished children. New York City has 2 million children, approximately one-quarter of whom have no medical insurance, and 60% of whom live in poverty or near-poverty households. This report, compiled by a special committee of 21 experts over more than two years, states that currently, child abuse, drug-induced birth defects, and pediatric AIDS have become major causes of death among impoverished children. The report believes that the root of health problems lies in poverty. The report acknowledges that medical services cannot cure the social conditions affecting children's health, but the lack of a comprehensive child healthcare system is a very serious problem.

    吸毒虐待　纽约儿童健康不佳
    贫困少医　美国枉称世界首富
    本报华盛顿7月24日电　据纽约市一份有关儿童健康的调查报告，纽约市儿童健康状况不佳，一系列医疗和社会问题威胁着整个一代贫困儿童的未来。纽约全市有200万儿童，约1／4的儿童无医疗保险，60％的儿童生活在贫困或近于贫困的家庭。这份由21名专家组成的专门小组经过两年多时间写成的报告称，目前，儿童受虐待、吸毒引起的婴儿后遗症以及儿科艾滋病成了贫困孩子死亡的重要原因。报告认为，健康问题的根源在于贫困。报告承认医疗服务无法医治影响儿童健康的社会条件，但儿童保健体系不健全是个极严重的问题。
