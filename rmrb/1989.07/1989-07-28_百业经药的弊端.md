According to incomplete statistics from our bureau, the province currently has 9,932 drug trading units. Among these, 1,500 are medical and pharmaceutical system commercial outlets, accounting for only 15%; 3,898 are other state-owned and collective units engaged in drug trading; and 4,534 are privately and individually operated drug trading units. There are 920 units engaged in pharmaceutical wholesale in the province, nearly 50% of which are outside the pharmaceutical industry. Shaoyang City has 243 pharmaceutical wholesale units, with only 20% belonging to the pharmaceutical industry. In Liantang Town, Shaodong County, there are fewer than 500 households, but there are 265 units engaged in the trade of medicinal materials, 261 of which are individual operators. These individual drug stores do not have pharmaceutical technicians, and their operating sites and storage facilities do not meet the requirements. Some do not have permits, and some do not have certificates of qualification.

The universal trade in medicines and the multiple entities engaged in pharmaceutical wholesale have led to the loss of control over drug circulation. This is mainly manifested in the following ways:

First, counterfeit and substandard drugs have entered the market. For example, the number of fake drugs discovered in the Yiyang region market increased from 28 types last year to 66 types the previous year. Some use cow bones to impersonate tiger bones, and some use sweet potatoes to substitute for yam.

Second, drug prices are chaotic. The Yueyang City Pharmaceutical General Company, in collaboration with the price department, inspected 14 pharmaceutical trading units outside the pharmaceutical industry and found more than 80 types of drugs with incorrect prices.

Third, illegal operations are rampant. Among the 290 individual drug stores in Xiangtan County, 145 do not have business permits. The health system in Liuyang County is engaged in pharmaceutical wholesale, evading and underreporting the state's wholesale price-added tax by more than 100,000 yuan annually. In Liantang Town, Shaodong County, 9 individual drug stores violate regulations by trading in toxic drugs.

Fourth, most drug stores purchase drugs based on profitability, ignoring market shortages and the urgent need for drugs in disaster-stricken and epidemic areas.

    百业经药的弊端
    据我局不完全统计，全省现有药品经营单位9932家。其中，医药系统商业网点1500家，仅占15％；其他国营、集体单位经营药品的有3898家，私营和个体经营药品的4534家。全省从事医药批发的有920家，其中近50％属医药行业以外的。邵阳市有医药批发单位243家，医药行业仅占20％。邵东县廉桥镇居民不到500户，但经营药材的却多达265家，其中261家是个体户。这些个体药店都没有药学技术人员，经营场地和仓储也不符合要求，有的没有许可证，有的没有合格证。
    百业经药，多头搞医药批发，致使药品流通失控。主要表现为：
    一是伪劣药品流入市场。如益阳地区市场上发现的假药由前年的28种增至去年的66种，有的用牛骨冒充虎骨，有的用白薯代淮山药。
    二是药品价格混乱。岳阳市医药总公司会同物价部门抽查了医药行业外的14家医药经营单位，共查出药品错价80多种。
    三是非法经营严重。湘潭县290家个体药店中，有145家没有经营许可证。浏阳县卫生系统从事医药批发，每年偷漏国家批发差价税10多万元。邵东县廉桥镇有9家个体药店违反规定，经营毒性药品。
    四是大部分药店看哪种药能赚钱，就购进哪种药，对市场上脱销和灾区、疫区急需药品不闻不问。
