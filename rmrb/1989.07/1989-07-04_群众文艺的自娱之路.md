The "Red May" workers' art festival in a certain city underwent layer upon layer of selections and took over half a year to prepare; the stage sets and costumes were quite expensive. During the official performance, the audience was sparse, and the applause was sparse, making it quite desolate!

Meanwhile, in some regions, "Everyone's Joy" self-recommended singing performances and "Karaoke" music halls where anyone can volunteer to go on stage are becoming increasingly popular with the masses.

This contrast has led us to reflect on the future of mass art. It seems that the path of mass art, which follows in the footsteps of professional art troupes and stands on the stage, isolated from the masses, is becoming narrower and narrower. For today's masses (not just the youth, but also the elderly), it is better to sing out loud in front of everyone than to sit quietly in the theater, and it is better to express oneself actively than to merely enjoy with one's eyes and ears as a passive observer—it is better to fish in the pond than to admire the fish from the shore?

Tracing back to ancient China, where poetry, dance, and music were integrated, and collective singing and dancing were the main forms, mass art, as a primitive and nationwide cultural form, originally had no distinction between audience and performer, and no stage to separate the two. Even during the time of Confucius, he taught students with rituals, music, poetry, and books, advocating the importance of the "Six Arts" (rituals, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics). It was only later, with the development of feudal society, that art became separated from the common people, entering the palace from the folk, and folk art began to wither, leaving only some self-entertainment in the market and folk customs. The educational policy also changed from "harmony of rituals and music" to "knowledge and reason," eliminating the position of "music." This situation was particularly pronounced in the Han nationality, while minorities like the Mongol, Uyghur, and Korean ethnic groups, who were far from the emperor, still largely continued the cultural tradition of singing and dancing. Several thousand years of feudal society and its backward economic foundation, coupled with the spiritual shackles of feudal etiquette that prohibited seeing, hearing, speaking, and moving, made it impossible for the flowers of mass art to bloom on such barren land.

History has entered the modern era, and whether it is economic development or cultural prosperity, it is time to return mass art to the masses themselves, both in need and in possibility. The aesthetic taste for stage art is increasingly refined, and the masses are quite demanding; this is not only true for amateur performances but also for professional art troupes. Haven't we seen the situation of the nationally watched Spring Festival Gala hosted by CCTV, which is like walking on thin ice? Therefore, it is better to let mass art take the path of self-entertainment, meeting the masses' desire for participation and self-expression, rather than the path of "professionalization," which is laborious and unpopular, pursuing stage performance effects. The latter is where the advantage of mass art lies; breaking down the boundary between audience and performer is exactly a way to leverage strengths and avoid weaknesses—because the essence of mass art lies in its mass nature.

    群众文艺的自娱之路
    张半解
    某市红五月职工文艺汇演，层层选拔、旷时逾半载；舞美服装，耗资颇可观。正式演出时，台下坐不盈场，且掌声稀落，好不冷清！
    与此同时，一些地区的“大家乐”自荐演唱会、自报奋勇即可登台的“卡拉OK”音乐厅，正大受群众欢迎红火起来。
    这一冷一热，引起我们对群众文艺前途的思考。看来，步专业文艺团体后尘高踞于舞台隔离于群众的“群众文艺”之路是愈走愈窄了。对今日群众（不仅是青年也包括老年）而言，与其屏息端坐于剧场台下，何如引吭放歌于广众之中，与其仅娱之耳目做客体观赏，何如手之舞之足之蹈之呈主体表现——临渊羡渔，何如退而结网？
    追溯远古华夏，集诗歌、舞蹈、音乐为一体，以集体歌舞为主要形式的群众文艺，作为一种原始的、全民的文化形态，原是没有观众与演员的区别，也没有舞台把二者隔开的。及至孔夫子，仍是以礼乐诗书教学生，主张“六艺”（礼乐射御书数）并重。只是后来，随着封建社会的发展，文艺才与百姓隔离，从民间进入宫廷，民间文艺随之萎缩，仅在市井民俗中，还留有些群众自娱的余地；教育方针也由“礼乐相济”改为“知书达理”，取消了“乐”的地位。这种情况，汉民族尤甚；而“天高皇帝远”的少数民族如蒙族、维吾尔族、朝鲜族等还较多地延续着能歌善舞的文化传统。几千年封建社会及其落后的经济基础，再加上非礼勿视勿听勿言勿动的封建礼教的精神枷锁，在这样一片瘠薄土地上，群众文艺之花是断难盛开的。
    历史跨入现代，无论是经济的发展还是文化的发达，都到了还群众文艺于群众自身的时候了，不仅需要而且可能。对舞台艺术的审美口味日高，群众相当挑剔；此不独对业余演出，对专业文艺团体也是很苛刻的。君不见举国瞩目如履薄冰的中央电视台主办的春节联欢会的境遇？因此，与其使群众文艺走费力而不讨好的“专业化”之路，追求舞台演出效果，何如走自娱之路，适群众的参与意识与自我表现的需求？后者才是群众文艺的优势所在；打破了观与演的界限恰为扬长避短——因为群众文艺之要，正在群众性上。
