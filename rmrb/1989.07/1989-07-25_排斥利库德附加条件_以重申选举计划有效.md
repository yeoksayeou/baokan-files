Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 23rd. According to reports from Jerusalem, the Israeli government, ignoring the Likud bloc's attempt to impose harsh conditions, reaffirmed today its plan to hold elections in the occupied territories.

Ministers in a four-hour cabinet meeting voted 21 to 4 in favor of reaffirming the plan.

A statement today said the government and parliament-approved peace plan remains valid, with no changes or amendments. This statement was drafted by Israeli Prime Minister Shamir and Deputy Prime Minister Peres.

After the cabinet meeting, Peres told reporters, "This is the decision we can accept." He said, "If this peace plan is the government's sole guiding principle, we will stay in the government."

The Labor Party, after its central committee meeting earlier this month, which endorsed a hardline stance by the Likud bloc on the election plan, threatened to withdraw from the coalition government.

The plan to hold elections in the occupied territories was proposed by Shamir in April and approved by the cabinet in May. The plan calls for approximately 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect representatives to negotiate temporary autonomy with Israel, and then seek a final solution to the occupied territories issue.

    排斥利库德附加条件
    以重申选举计划有效
    新华社开罗7月23日电  据来自耶路撒冷的报道，以色列政府无视利库德集团试图附加的苛刻条件，今天重申了政府有关在被占领土举行选举的计划。
    部长们在4小时的内阁会议上，以21票赞成、4票反对，批准重申这项计划。
    声明今天说，政府和议会通过的和平计划依然有效，没有任何改变和修正。这项声明是由以色列总理沙米尔和副总理佩雷斯起草的。
    内阁会议后，佩雷斯对记者说，这是“我们所能够接受的决定”。他说：“如果这项和平计划是政府的唯一指导路线，我们将呆在政府里。”
    工党在利库德集团有关选举计划的强硬路线在其本月初召开的中央委员会会议上获得成功后，扬言要退出联合政府。
    这项在被占领土举行选举的计划是由沙米尔在4月提出、内阁5月通过的。这项计划要求约旦河西岸和加沙地带的大约170万巴勒斯坦人选出代表同以色列就临时自治问题进行谈判，然后寻求最终解决被占领土问题。
