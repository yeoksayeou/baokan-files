During my visit to the United States in 1979, I first came into contact with Taiwanese literature and was surprised to discover that during the 1960s and 1970s, while the mainland was deeply engrossed in class struggles and the eight model operas dominated the stage, the island had produced some remarkable literary works. Upon my return, I called for the study of Taiwanese literature.

In recent years, Taiwanese literature has become quite popular. Many works by Taiwanese authors have become bestsellers, and some are almost household names. The widespread publication of Taiwanese works has broadened our literary horizons and deepened our understanding of the other side of the Taiwan Strait.

However, the research on Taiwanese literature has lagged far behind the publication of these works. This is not conducive to the exchange of literature between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait or to a deeper understanding of Taiwanese literature. This "Dictionary of Taiwan's New Literature (1919–1986)" not only introduces works and authors but also summarizes the trends and debates in the Taiwanese literary world. It will certainly help promote a deeper understanding of Taiwanese literature.

Reference books are fundamental to cultural endeavors. It is not possible to expect readers to first complete a study of Taiwanese literary history before engaging with the works. A dictionary is like a knowledgeable consultant, available for readers to consult at any time and flip through at will, without needing to read from cover to cover. Those with an interest may even be led from casual browsing to systematic research.

Therefore, I believe that this dictionary, published by Sichuan People's Publishing House, will be of great benefit in popularizing and deepening the understanding of Taiwanese literature.

    认识台湾新文学
    ——介绍《台湾新文学辞典》
    萧乾
    1979年访美时，我初次接触到台湾文学，猛然发觉六、七十年代，当大陆在大搞阶级斗争，八个样板戏逞强称霸，诗神处于五花大绑状态时，那座宝岛上却结出了一些引人注目的果实。归来，我曾为开展台湾文学的研究而大声疾呼。
    近年来，台湾文学风行一时了。许多台湾作家的作品成为畅销书，有的几乎家喻户晓了。台湾作品的大量出版，开阔了我们的文学视野，增进了对海峡彼岸的了解。
    美中不足的是：台湾文学研究的开展远远落后于作品的印行。对海峡两岸文学交往以及深入了解台湾文学来说，这是不利的。这部《台湾新文学辞典》（ 1919—1986）除了介绍作品及作家，也概述了台湾文艺界的思潮及论争，肯定会有助于推动对台湾文学作进一步的了解。
    工具书是文化事业的基本建设。不可能要求读者先把台湾文学史读完，再去接触作品。辞典像位学识渊博的顾问，可供读者随时咨询，随手翻阅，而不必从头到尾去读。有心人士也可能从偶然翻阅进而导致有系统的研究。
    因此，我认为这部由四川人民出版社出版的辞典对于普及并加深对台湾文学的认识，是大有裨益的。
