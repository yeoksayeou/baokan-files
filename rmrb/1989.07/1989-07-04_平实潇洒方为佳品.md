The collection of essays "Dream, Bodhisattva, the Moon on the Fifteenth Night" is the fourth book written by the veteran literary editor He Qitong, and it is his first collection of essays. Just from the title, one can tell that the content is quite colorful and varied.

I have always believed that if a person has a rich life experience, they have a duty to write about it and share it with others. Moreover, I believe that an excellent editor should, in their spare time, also write some works of their own. Writing personally can deepen one's understanding of the subtle nuances of literary language. Of course, if an editor neglects a large number of manuscripts and instead busies themselves with writing their own works, that is not commendable. However, if they complete their duties and also write occasionally, I think it is worth encouraging. In casual conversations, I felt that He Qitong's literary cultivation is quite good, and I was surprised to learn that he had worked in Qinghai and Tibet and was quite familiar with the customs and scenery of Tibet. Later, due to his editorial work, he traveled to many provinces across the country. I remember in the late 1970s, I repeatedly expressed this view to Qitong, hoping that he would write more articles in the future, not to waste his honed penmanship and rich life experiences. At that time, he expressed strong agreement with this view.

I have read most of the articles in this book, which is soon to be published by Lijiang Publishing House. The entire manuscript consists of 24 essays, totaling approximately 170,000 words. The book is divided into four sections. Some essays describe the borderlands and the customs of ethnic minorities, while others lament life and express personal feelings. There are also a few essays that commemorate and remember senior writers in the literary world. The last section consists of three pieces of reportage, each describing a literary critic, a natural scientist, and the process of publishing the new edition of "The Complete Works of Lu Xun." I find them all quite readable. Literary works should have a certain degree of literary merit and unique content to attract readers. As a veteran literary editor, Qitong naturally understands these nuances.

Using concise language to vividly capture and describe the subject, making it feel tangible, is a characteristic of many chapters in this book. For example, in "Notes on the Potala Palace," the author describes:

"Upon reaching the foot of the mountain and looking up at the Potala Palace, one feels even more awe-inspired by its grandeur and majesty. The palace walls are built with beautiful granite, very sturdy. Its white lower half and the upper half, which is the color of pomegranate red, are clearly connected, as if embodying sanctity and dignity. Its countless windows seem like friendly, shining eyes, welcoming visitors to come up and visit..."

Such descriptions are quite vivid. Similarly, in "Visiting Bing Xin When the Plum Blossoms Bloom," he describes this elder sister of the literary world:

"Bing Xin has gray and white hair with some spots, and her face naturally has some age spots, but her forehead is full, her skin is slightly red, and her complexion is good. Her eyes are still very spirited. Her attire is quite simple: a light blue and light yellow checkered Chinese-style top, black pants, and black cloth shoes, giving a sense of simplicity and warmth..."

Though it is just a few words, one can see the author's keen observation and skill with the pen. Having both "substance" and "style" naturally makes this collection of essays reach a certain level of excellence.

Of course, everyone's taste in writing style may not be the same. If one were to be more critical, I would say: the author's writing is quite solid in its simplicity. If it could be more elegant, it would be even better. Steady and solid writing is like a dish with too little sauce, seeming a bit thick. If there were more lyrical elements, more colloquial language, and more humor and wit, I think its fluency and liveliness could be improved. However, this is just a casual suggestion of mine.

    平实潇洒方为佳品
    秦牧
    《梦·菩萨·十五的月亮》这本散文集子，是文学老编辑何启治同志写的第四本书，也是他的第一本散文集子。单看书名也可以知道，它所含的内容是相当多彩多姿的。
    我一向认为：一个人如果有丰富的阅历，就有把它写出来让大家知道的义务。而且，我还认为一个优秀的编辑，最好在工作之余，自己也经常写点作品。因为亲自动笔，对于文学语言的细致微妙之处，可以体会更深。自然，一个编辑如果对大量的来稿搁置不理，却忙着去撰写自己的作品，那是殊无足取的；但是如果在完成了本职工作之后，也经常动笔，我觉得却是值得提倡的事。在闲谈中，我除了感到何启治的学养颇好外，还惊异地知道，原来他曾在青海、西藏工作过，颇熟悉西藏的人情风物，又因后来从事编辑工作的关系，到过国内许多省区。记得在70年代末，我曾再三向启治表达了这点见解，希望他将来经常写点文章，不辜负自己练就的一套笔墨和经历过的丰富生活。当时他对这一点是表示很有同感的。
    我翻阅过这本即将由漓江出版社出版的书中文章的大部分，全部书稿计24篇，约17万字。全书分四辑，或写边塞，兄弟民族风情，或咏叹人生，直抒胸臆，还有几篇纪念、怀念文坛前辈作家的文字，最后一辑则是三篇报告文学，分别写文艺评论家、自然科学家和介绍新版《鲁迅全集》诞生的历程，觉得它们都有相当的可读性。文学作品，总应该有一定的文采和独特的内容，才会吸引读者。作为一位文学老编辑，启治自然深知个中三昧。
    用简练的笔墨一下子就攫住了对象，把它描绘出来，令人有可触可摸的感受。这是本书许多篇章的特色。例如，在《布达拉宫散记》中，作者这样描写道：
    “来到山脚下，仰望布达拉宫，更觉巍峨雄伟，气势磅礴。宫墙是用美丽的花岗石叠砌而成的，十分坚固，它那洁白的下半身和石榴红的上半部，界线分明地连接在一起，仿佛是圣洁和庄重的化身。它那千百个窗户，宛若一双双闪灼的眼睛友善地看着游人，仿佛在招呼我们快点上去作客……”
    这样的描绘，是颇够形象的。又如，在《迎春花开访冰心》一文中，他这样描绘了文学界的这位老大姊：
    “冰心，头上是灰黄斑白的头发，脸上当然已有些许老人斑了，但天庭饱满，皮肤微红，气色很好，那双眼睛也还很有神采。她的穿着可就十分素雅了：藕荷色带浅黄方格的中式上衣，蓝黑色裤子，黑面布鞋，朴素中给人一种亲切感……”
    虽是寥寥数语，但从中很可以想见作者观察的细致和笔墨的功夫。有“质”又有“文”，自然就使这本散文集子达到了一定的可观的水平。
    自然，每个人对于文笔的爱好未必是很一致的。如果挑剔一点来说，我觉得：作者的文字，在平实方面，是很够功力的。如果能够更潇洒一些，那就更好了。稳重扎实的文字，有些像水少料多的食物，似嫌稠了一点，如有更多的抒情，更多的口语，更多的幽默风趣掺杂其间，我想，它的流畅生动的程度，还可以更提高一步。不过，这只是我顺便提出的一点期待罢了。
