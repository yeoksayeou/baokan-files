Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 1st — (Reporters Chen Maodi, Correspondent Lu Zhengyi) Yesterday, the Xuhui District People's Court in Shanghai handed down a first-instance verdict in Shanghai's first administrative litigation case involving an appeal against a drug management administrative penalty: upholding the Xuhui District Health Bureau's administrative penalty against Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company for illegal drug production.

According to the Xuhui District Court, Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company signed a contract in September 1986 with the Heqiao Hospital in Wuxi, Jiangsu, to jointly produce a type of interferon. After the contract was signed, Heqiao Hospital orally sought approval from the Wuxi City Health Bureau, which explicitly responded that production was not permitted. However, Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company and Heqiao Hospital ignored the health administration's opinion and proceeded to produce the interferon. By the time they were ordered to stop production by the Wuxi City Health Bureau in February of the following year, they had produced 25 batches, totaling over 23,700 bottles. More seriously, the company's chief engineer, taking advantage of his position as a consultant at a certain central hospital in Shanghai, conducted trials on five healthy individuals without approval, followed by illegal clinical trials, and sold the drugs through the hospital and other units. Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company profited over 51,000 yuan from this.

After receiving a recommendation from the Wuxi City Health Bureau to investigate the matter in October of last year, the Xuhui District Health Bureau and the District Administration for Industry and Commerce conducted an investigation and made a decision: ordering Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company to stop producing this interferon, and confiscating and destroying the seized drugs. Additionally, the company's illegal earnings of over 51,000 yuan were confiscated, and a fine of over 356,000 yuan was imposed.

Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company appealed the penalty and filed a lawsuit with the Xuhui District People's Court. After reviewing the case, the court ruled in the first instance to uphold the Xuhui District Health Bureau's administrative penalty notice against Shanghai Global Biological Engineering Company; to revoke the Xuhui District Administration for Industry and Commerce's subject qualification in the administrative penalty notice, and to transfer the fine to the Xuhui District Health Bureau.

The issues with Heqiao Hospital are being handled by relevant departments in Wuxi City.

    维护行政机关职权  加强药品生产管理
    上海审理一起行政诉讼案
    新华社上海7月1日电　（记者陈毛弟、通讯员陆正一）上海市徐汇区人民法院昨天对上海市第一起不服药品管理行政处罚的行政诉讼案作出一审判决：维持徐汇区卫生局对非法生产药品的上海环球生物工程公司的行政处罚。
    据徐汇区法院介绍，上海环球生物工程公司1986年9月与江苏无锡市和桥医院签订了联合试制一种干扰素的合同。合同签订后，和桥医院曾口头向无锡市卫生局请示，无锡市卫生局明确答复不准生产。但环球生物工程公司与和桥医院无视卫生行政部门的意见，仍擅自生产，至去年2月被无锡市卫生局责令停产时止，共生产这种干扰素25批、23700多瓶。更严重的，这家公司聘用的总工程师，利用兼任上海某中心医院顾问的便利条件，未经批准，将药物用在5名正常人身上进行试验，继而又非法进行临床试验，同时通过医院和另一些单位非法销售这批药物。上海环球生物工程公司从中获利51000余元。
    上海市徐汇区卫生局、区工商行政管理局去年10月接到无锡市卫生局查处此事的建议后，经调查，作出决定：责令环球生物工程公司停止生产这种干扰素，同时，没收、销毁查获的药品，没收这家公司非法所得的51000余元和对其罚款356000余元。
      上海环球生物工程公司对处罚不服，向徐汇区人民法院提起诉讼。区法院经过审理，一审判决维持徐汇区卫生局对上海环球生物工程公司的行政处罚通知书；撤销徐汇区工商行政管理局在行政处罚通知书中的主体资格，罚款改交给徐汇区卫生局。
    和桥医院的问题由无锡市有关部门处理。
