The premiere of the television documentary "Flying High, the Flag of the Republic" and the opening ceremony of the large-scale photography exhibition "Suppressing the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion, Defending the People's Republic" were held today at the National Art Museum of China. Li Ruihuan, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and Yang Baibing, Director of the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, respectively cut the ribbons for the premiere and the opening ceremony.

The television documentary "Flying High, the Flag of the Republic" and the photography exhibition "Suppressing the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion, Defending the People's Republic" use authentic on-site footage and rich photographic materials to reenact the entire process of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, from its inception and development to its suppression. They reveal the international background and domestic social foundations of this turmoil, expose the conspiracy of a few people against the Party and socialism, and the criminal acts of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. They reflect the spirit of struggle of the capital's military and civilians, who, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, united as one and fought bravely. The television documentary "Flying High, the Flag of the Republic" is divided into four parts: "Storm Surge," "Turmoil Tide," "Rebellion Truth," and "Everlasting Glory," with a total length of one hundred and five minutes. The photography exhibition "Suppressing the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion, Defending the People's Republic" collects more than three hundred works, divided into ten parts: "Beijing in Turmoil," "Correct Decision," "Rebellion Truth," "Marching Towards Tiananmen Square," "Clearing Tiananmen Square," and so on.

Before the ribbon-cutting ceremony, Zhou Keyi, Deputy Director of the General Political Department, said in his speech that these photographic works and video footage are valuable historical evidence taken by many comrades at the risk of their lives. They help the people further clarify the facts, deeply understand the recent important speeches by Chairman Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, enhance their awareness and determination to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, and unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, working together for the realization of the Four Modernizations and the revitalization of China.

Those who attended the premiere and the opening ceremony included Ding Guanggen, Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, Chi Haotian, Zhao Nanqi, and responsible comrades from the three general departments of the military, the General Office of the Central Military Commission, the Party Central Committee and state organs, the Beijing Municipal Committee, and the capital's news units.
