A certain artillery regiment, stationed in the capital to carry out martial law, has strict discipline and provides convenient services to the people, earning praise from the local residents.

After moving into a certain commercial building, the manager of the shopping mall saw the officers and soldiers working day and night. He approached the leadership and offered to provide the officers and soldiers with a batch of color televisions, refrigerators, and name-brand cigarettes, alcohol, and cameras at a discount. The regiment's leaders and staff strictly adhered to discipline, declined the manager's kindness, and resolutely refused to purchase scarce and controlled goods. Since the army frequently changes locations, it is inconvenient to transport the leaders' belongings. Someone in the headquarters suggested buying a few suitcases for several leaders in the regiment to hold their work and living items. Upon hearing this, the regiment commander and political commissar firmly stopped it.

During their one-month stay in Beijing, the regiment assisted with the construction of the arrow tower at Zhengyangmen, helped the Beijing Municipal Floriculture Company set up the flower beds at Tiananmen Square, and aided the Chongwen District Telecommunications Bureau in laying cables. They received praise from local party and government agencies and the people.

    某炮团遵纪爱民受称赞
    本报讯　在首都执行戒严任务的某炮团，严明纪律，开展便民服务，受到驻地群众的称赞。
    这支部队驻进某商业大厦后，商场经理见干部战士日夜操劳，便找到领导，要优惠供应给干部战士一批彩电、冰箱和名烟、酒、照相机。团领导和机关的同志严守纪律，谢绝了经理的好意，坚决不购买紧俏和专控商品。部队经常调换地方，领导的东西装运不方便，机关有人建议给团里几位首长购买一个皮箱，盛放工作和生活用具。团长、政委得知后，坚决制止了。在京一个月，部队帮助正阳门箭楼施工、协助北京市花木公司摆设天安门花坛，帮助崇文区电讯局架设电缆，受到当地党政机关和人民群众的称赞。　（刘选启）
