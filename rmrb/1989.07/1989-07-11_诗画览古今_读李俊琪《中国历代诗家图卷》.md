	Poetry and painting are a survey of the ages
	—Reading Li Junqi's "Scroll of Chinese Poets Through the Ages"
	Sūn Měilán

	Li Junqi, a painter from Heilongjiang, exhibited his monumental work, "Scroll of Chinese Poets Through the Ages," at the National Art Museum of China. The painting, created over three and a half years and a decade of dedication, spans 170 meters in length and 2 meters in height. It includes 510 poets from the pre-Qin period to the near modern era, covering the Han, Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, Sui, Tang, Five Dynasties, Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties.

	The scroll adopts the traditional Chinese long scroll format, using simple line drawings and freehand ink painting to depict the figures. It lightly applies colors, capturing characteristic backgrounds, props, and natural environments to evoke the atmosphere of the times and highlight the theme. The artist's solid foundation in calligraphy and form establishes the structure of the entire work. He incorporates literary, historical, philosophical, and aesthetic considerations to achieve a transcendent, panoramic artistic composition that surpasses specific time and space.

	Since his youth, the artist has admired national patriotic poets and attempted to paint their portraits. Over the years, he has accumulated a deep understanding of the lives of important poets throughout history and has read their works extensively. He is committed to promoting the spirit and character of the Chinese nation, creating portraits of outstanding poets, thinkers, and innovators. He has created thousands of sketches over the years. In depicting the psychological activities of modern poets, he uses a strong sense of crisis, dramatic conflicts, and the tension between the inner self and form to create a climax in the entire work. The unyielding spirit of Tan Sitong in prison, the heroic and tragic atmosphere of Qiu Jin, and the tragic and heroic melody of sacrificing one's life are all vividly expressed.

	The artist's creative vision is undoubtedly a bold move: First, from philosophical, historical, literary, and aesthetic perspectives, there have always been points of contention from Laozi, Zhuangzi, Confucius, and Mencius to Wang Guowei and Su Manshu. Second, today's art world tends towards pure painting, reversing the heavy burden of thought content. Third, famous poets are widely acclaimed, and readers have their own ideal images, making it difficult to conceptualize and capture. Now, turning to visual language to achieve a perfect form, the difficulty is doubled. As the saying goes, poets have two "images" in the realm of plastic arts: one is the image evoked by their poetry, and the other is the poet's own image. These two images sometimes coincide and sometimes diverge, presenting a great challenge to the plastic artist. Fourth, in terms of the temperament of Chinese poets throughout history, they can generally be divided into two types: repressed and unrestrained. It is easier for the painter to succeed if their temperament matches, and it is easier to fail if it does not. Li Junqi's depictions of Wen Tingyun, Li Shangyin, and Li Qingzhao seem more successful than those of Yue Fei, Wen Tianxiang, Cao Pi, and Cao Zhi, perhaps because of the divine language of certain psychological temperaments.

	Li Junqi, with his courage, completed a monumental poem-painting scroll, knocking on the door of traditional cultural psychology. Its successes and failures are yet to be evaluated by the viewers.

    诗画览古今
    ——读李俊琪《中国历代诗家图卷》
    孙美兰
    黑龙江画家李俊琪，在中国美术馆展出他以3年半时间、10年心血创制的巨幅人物画——《中国历代诗家图卷》。全画长170米，高2米，包括自先秦始，历经两汉、魏晋、南北朝、隋唐五代、宋、辽金、元明清直到近代的诗家510人。
    图卷取中国传统绘画长卷形式，用简约的线描兼以写意泼墨塑造人物，略施丹彩，撷取富特征性的背景、道具、自然环境点染时代氛围，烘托主题。画家以他坚实的书法功底、造型奠定全画的构架基础，融入文学、史学、哲学和美学多侧面的思考，实现超越具体时空的纵览宏观式艺术构成。
    画家少年时代即崇仰民族爱国诗人，尝试画像。多年来日积月累，深研历代重要诗家生平、精读其诗作，立志于中华民族精神、浩荡品格的弘扬，为杰出诗人、思想家、革新家造像，先后作素描草图凡千百数。在处理近代诗家心理活动时，以强烈的忧患意识、戏剧性冲突、内心和形式的张力，掀起了全画高潮。谭嗣同狱中题壁的刚正铁骨，秋瑾苍凉的侠义雄风，以生命为祭的悲壮激越旋律，得到酣畅的抒发表现。
    画家的创作构想的实现，无疑是一步险棋：其一，无论从哲学、史学角度，还是文学、美学角度，远自老庄孔孟，近至王国维、苏曼殊，历来存在着争论的歧异点。其二，今日画坛，趋向着纯绘画性，一反思想内容负荷过重。其三，名诗家众口皆碑，读者各有其理想之心像，难以思议和捕捉，今转而以视觉语言求造型的完满实现，难度倍增。明鉴者言，诗人对造型艺术来说，有两“象”存在，一是其诗文唤起的对诗人向往中的形象，二是诗人本身的形象。两种形象时而统一，时而分离，给造型艺术家带来巨大难度。其四，以我国历代诗家气质而论，大体上分抑郁型和豪放型两类，作画人气质与之暗合者易胜，不合者易殆。李俊琪笔下的温庭筠、李商隐，李清照之“像”似胜于岳飞、文天祥、曹丕、曹植之“像”，在于某些心理气质的语言通神吧。
    李俊琪以其胆识，完成一部诗画巨卷，扣响了传统文化心理的门扉，其成败得失之处，尚有待观赏者评点。
