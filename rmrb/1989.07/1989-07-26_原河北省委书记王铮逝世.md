The farewell ceremony for the late Wang Zheng, former Secretary of the CPC Hebei Provincial Committee and Director of the Preparatory Group of the Hebei Provincial Advisory Committee, was held in Shijiazhuang yesterday.

Wang Zheng passed away on July 16 due to illness at the age of 74.

Wang Zheng was born in Yixian County, Liaoning Province. During his studies at Northeast University in Beijing in 1935, he joined the Communist Youth League. In the spring of 1936, he became a member of the Communist Party of China and participated in the famous December 9th Movement. In 1937, he went to the anti-Japanese base in the Taihang Mountains. In 1945, he participated in the great struggle to liberate all of Northeast China. After the founding of New China, he held various positions, including Deputy Secretary of the Liaodong Provincial Committee and Second Secretary of the Liaoning Provincial Committee. Wang Zheng was an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal communist warrior tested by time, and a revolutionary of the proletariat. He had a strong party spirit, clear distinctions between right and wrong, a simple style, a pragmatic approach, and close ties with the masses. He was open and upright, strict with himself, and lenient with others. He studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought diligently. Even in his final moments, he remained concerned about the affairs of the party and the state, firmly supporting the resolutions made at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.
