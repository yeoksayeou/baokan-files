A student named Zhou Xiaomei, aged 10, from the employee children's school of our factory, went missing on the evening of March 7. Ten days have passed, and Xiaomei's whereabouts are still unknown.

It turns out that on that day, Xiaomei, after school, got into a petty argument and refused to go home. She went to the Qinglongshan train station and boarded the 403 train (from Fuyang to Xuzhou) to Xuzhou, Jiangsu. By the time she reached the terminal station, it was already 11 PM. She got off the train and exited the station, feeling cold and hungry, and began to miss home.

At dawn on the 8th, she boarded the 131 train without a clear destination. In the afternoon, she got off at the Luoyang station in Henan and found herself in a strange place. She couldn't help but burst into tears. At this moment, an elderly woman named Sun Yulan asked about her situation. After hearing her story, Sun Yulan took her to eat and then went to the station police office to explain the situation.

This elderly woman had come to Luoyang to visit her son. Xiaomei was warmly received at Sun Yulan's son's home. The next day, the old woman and the young girl took a bus back to Sun Yulan's home in Shangguicun, Xingyang County, Henan.

Sun Yulan and her husband Zhang Mingli treated Xiaomei like their own granddaughter, playing with her, cooking her delicious meals, supervising her studies, and even buying her a new set of clothes. More than ten days passed, and the old couple were still worried: Where is this child's home? Xiaomei only knew that her home was in Qinglongshan but couldn't describe where Qinglongshan was. Finally, Sun Yulan found a work order with "Huainan Coal Selection Plant" written on it in Xiaomei's pocket. Only then did they realize where Xiaomei lived. The couple decided to send the child back home.

On the 20th, Xiaomei reluctantly said goodbye to "Grandpa" and was escorted home by Sun Yulan. On the 21st, Xiaomei safely returned home. Seeing the child they hadn't seen for over a month and hearing about her ordeal, Xiaomei's parents were moved to tears. The factory presented the elderly couple with a "Helping Others" honor plaque.

    小姑娘赌气误走洛阳  孙大娘热情护送回家
    我厂职工子弟学校学生、10岁的周晓梅于3月7日晚走失了。10天过去了，晓梅还是下落不明。
    原来，那天晓梅放学后，为一件小事赌气不回家，来到青龙山车站，乘上了403次（阜阳至徐州）列车到达终点站江苏徐州时，已是深夜11点了。她下车出站感到寒冷、饥饿，便想家了。
    8日凌晨，她盲目乘上131次列车，下午1点在河南洛阳站下车，发现已身在他乡，忍不住哭了起来。这时，有位叫孙玉兰的老大娘问清原委后，带她吃了饭，然后到车站派出所说明情况。
    这位老大娘是来洛阳看儿子的。晓梅在孙大娘的儿子家受到了热情接待。次日，一老一小乘汽车回到河南荥阳县下果乡上街村孙大娘的家里。
    孙大娘和老伴张明礼待晓梅就像亲孙女，陪她玩，给她做好吃的，督促她学习，还给她添了一身新衣服。一晃10多天过去了，老两口心里一直在犯愁：这孩子的家到底在哪里？晓梅只知道家在青龙山，却说不清青龙山在什么地方。最后，孙大娘从晓梅内衣口袋里翻出一张有“淮北选煤厂”字样的领料单，才弄清楚晓梅的居住地。老两口商量，决定送孩子回家。
    20日，晓梅恋恋不舍地告别了“爷爷”，由孙大娘专程送她返家。21日，晓梅平安到家了。看到分别半个多月的孩子，听了这段曲折的经历，晓梅的父母感动地流下了眼泪。厂里为此赠给老人一块“助人为乐”光荣匾。
