The car navigated through the undulating hills of the Loess Plateau, suddenly coming to a halt at the peak of one of the ridges.

He stepped out of the car, stood still, and gazed into the distance.

Everything before his eyes was yellow.

The sky was like a vast blue iron pot, inside which countless steamed buns were being cooked. Gradually, steam rose from the buns, growing larger and spreading throughout the sky and earth.

"Here comes the dust again!" he muttered to himself.

A vast, hazy yellow covered everything. The yellow was so intense that it made one's heart race and left one breathless. He longed to see some other color. Suddenly, he noticed a few red dots moving between the hills. Ah, those must be girls and wives taking shelter from the dust storm. Slowly, the red dots disappeared, blending into the hills, vanishing into thin air. Right, there were a few rows of small earthen houses in the valley. In an instant, the wind and dust engulfed them. Sigh, the women in the mountains didn't know how to dress up. Why didn't they wear green clothes? Even a hint of green in this vast yellow world would bring immense joy—it is the original color of life!

The wind carried dust, swirling around his feet and body. He quickly wrapped himself tighter in his tweed overcoat, wondering why he too was wearing a yellowish-brown coat. Then he thought about his own appearance: a dark, round face, short, straight hair, bright eyes, and a muscular body like a black iron tower! He was a genuine farmer from the Loess Plateau, born and bred in the yellow earth.

He sang his favorite song, "Yellow Earth Plateau":

    My home is on the Yellow Earth Plateau,
    The wind blows over the plateau.
    Whether it's the northwest wind or the southeast wind,
    It's all my song, my song...

As he sang, he danced, performing a disco.

He had just returned from studying abroad. On January 8th of this year, as the first batch of peasant entrepreneurs from Gansu Province, he visited Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong at his own expense. Upon his return to Beijing, he held a press conference and was received by the Vice Minister of Agriculture. In Lanzhou, he reported to the provincial and municipal leaders. By the time he returned to Linxia, it was just before the Spring Festival of 1989.

At this moment, the son of the Loess Plateau had a surge of green waves in his heart. He thought, if the green kingdom of Thailand could be transplanted to the Loess Plateau, how beautiful it would be! At that moment, his ideal seemed to have become a reality. But for now, the wind and dust tightly surrounded him, and he could only twist and turn within it.

"Comrade Ma, come in quickly!"

Someone called out to him. His name was Ma Zhanlin. As the founder of six key enterprises in Linxia, he also served as the deputy director of the Economic Commission of Huangniwan Township and the party branch secretary of two villages. Moreover, he was the chairman of seven mosque management committees—holding political, economic, and religious power in one region.

But more vividly, he was a fierce warrior of the "Hui Minority Brigade" on the Loess Plateau!

The car continued to weave through the winding mountains and valleys.

Ma Zhanlin's thoughts also swirled.

Just before his trip abroad, he was in great distress. After the rectification and tightening of credit, his enterprises suddenly faced a cash flow crisis. Especially the Social Welfare Wool Factory, which had raised 3.18 million yuan and started production in September of the previous year, had only been operating for two months before hitting a red light. So, how would the more than 1,000 employees of the six enterprises make a living? Especially the disabled workers in the welfare factory, who had just found jobs, could they be allowed to be unemployed again? He couldn't understand it. In the past, temples held charity events, distributing porridge for only three days a year, which could only help a few poor people. Even if the emperor opened the granaries for relief, how many disaster-stricken people could be saved? While his welfare factory, in one go, provided lifelong support for so many disabled people, allowing them to support their families, which greatly reduced the burden on the state! However, now that there was not a penny of loan available, the enterprise was at a standstill, and he had no choice but to go to Lanzhou to find a way out.

He drowned his sorrows in alcohol, drinking cup after cup; he smoked to relieve his boredom, one cigarette after another. He wandered to the Yellow River, singing his favorite song with deep emotion:

    No matter how many years have passed,
    My ancestors left me here.
    Left me to sing songs across the boundless land,
    With the Yellow River by my side.

Looking at the rolling waves of the Yellow River, he felt both heartache and relief as he reminisced about the past.

He was born 17 days before the founding of the Republic, in a poor peasant family in Huangniwan, Linxia County.

Ancient Linxia, known as Hezhou, is located at the junction of the Loess Plateau and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, and is a transitional zone between the Han agricultural area and the minority nomadic area. The Silk Road and the ancient Tang-Tibet Road both pass through here. The historical tea-horse trade and the 24 trade passes still have remnants today. The Hui people, who were born and raised here, have a long-standing tradition of commerce. However, due to long-term closure and isolation, the Hui people, who had been engaged in commerce for generations, were also confined to the barren Loess Plateau for a long time.

He only attended four years of primary school. During the three years of difficulty, he was forced to drop out of school.

In 1969, he managed to enter the Agricultural Machinery School. After graduation, he worked at the commune's agricultural machinery station and started the first factory in Linxia with nothing. He used his relationship with the sent-down youth to seek help from several large factories in Lanzhou for machinery and various materials, engaging in simple mechanical processing and woodwork. However, the extreme leftist line still tightly bound his hands and feet. By the Daxia River, he stood for a long time, gazing at the Tuomen Pass in silence. This pass is located at the junction of Linxia and Xunhua County. To the south of the pass are rocky mountains, and to the north are loess mountains. The water of the Daxia River to the south is clear and sparkling, while the water to the north is muddy and yellow. Could this be the junction of the two great plateaus? Did the ancient tea-horse trade take place here? Yes, it must have. At that time, the sound of camel bells, the neighing of horses, the bustling crowd, and the noise of people—how lively and prosperous it was! Now, the Tuomen Pass is silent, the road is deserted, and only the water of the Daxia River flows slowly northward... The water can flow, but can living people not move? Does socialism mean poverty and backwardness? Will we always be stuck in this yellow earth, living in poverty for the rest of our lives? He could not forget the days when a worker earned only 14 cents, nor the days when children went bare-bottomed in the winter, and girls wore tattered clothes. He longed to break free from the confinement of the Loess Plateau and let his fellow villagers live a prosperous and comfortable life!

The Republic reached its prime at the age of 30, albeit a bit late. The spring breeze of reform and opening up blew over the Loess Plateau, and the Hui people of Linxia were the first to embark on the Silk Road and the ancient Tang-Tibet Road, beginning their journey to prosperity.

The "Hui Minority Brigade" of Huangniwan set out in full gear.

The wind howled, and the Xiahe River roared. Amidst the crows' cries, Huangniwan sent off the heroes. Ma Zhanlin led his subordinates and solemnly swore to the elders and fellow villagers: "To cut off the roots of poverty, to never be destitute again, we swear to bring back a golden baby with our hardworking hands!"

The "Hui Minority Brigade" was active on the Qinghai-Tibet, Gannan, and Loess Plateaus, opening mountains, building bridges, paving roads, and rescuing disasters. They drank bitter water, ate dry rations, and did the hardest and most tiring work. Later, they went to Maqu to build a fishery and a military horse farm, and to build houses. Afterwards, they divided into four small teams to undertake construction projects in various places.

Most of them were illiterate, and when they started construction, they became blind. Ma Zhanlin bought several hundred yuan worth of books and, together with cultured people like Ma Guoliang and Xiao Jianzhong, studied them together, gradually learning to read drawings, estimate costs, and design projects. These seeds were then passed on to teach others, starting from one, two, three, four, slowly "eradicating illiteracy."

Ma Zhanlin's team marched onto the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, setting up tents in the desolate mountains. There was no grass or trees, only bare, white mountains. Their lives were truly hard! Every day, they went up the mountain to collect stones, carrying large stones down from a 50-degree slope, one wrong step and they would roll down the valley. They worked from dawn to dusk, earning only three yuan a day. Unfortunately, an accident happened, a young man was crushed to death by a rolling stone, and Ma Zhanlin hugged his comrade's corpse, crying uncontrollably... But he and his brigade were not deterred by death and setbacks. They buried their comrade according to Islamic rituals, wiped their tears, and continued to advance. They came to the rescue of the Liujiaxia to Xigu highway, where the mountain had collapsed, blocking the road. With no village in front and no shop behind, they had to live in damp and dark cave dwellings. However, due to changes in the budget, they were idle for 34 days, eating a truckload of flour for free, and losing over 10,000 yuan. Later, when they started work, they worked day and night. After a shift, their bodies felt like they had fallen apart. Ma Zhanlin lay against the wall, his legs severely affected by rheumatism, the pain piercing his heart, making it difficult for him to even sit up.

After several years of construction, the members of Ma Zhanlin's Hui Brigade had all saved some money, but the construction team had lost 52,000 yuan. He did not let everyone contribute, taking full responsibility himself. Then, he led everyone to start a business. The years of traveling tens of thousands of miles, going south and north, made them familiar with the market conditions everywhere, and they ran the business smoothly.

Ma Zhanlin's first venture was a success. He bought more than 40 mares from the Hequ Military Horse Farm and chartered three train cars to transport them to Guanzhong. Just as the Guanzhong farmers had started the responsibility system, they saw his Hequ horses, which were well-proportioned, strong, and durable, suitable for both pulling and riding, a famous breed. They were quickly snapped up. Ma Zhanlin keenly saw that with the opening up and revitalization of the inland economy, Linxia would become a major distribution center for fur in China. He then established the Rich People Inn in Nanlong Township, Gadingjia, Linxia City, to accommodate traveling merchants, make friends, and collect information; and established a livestock product purchasing and marketing station, acting as both a traveling merchant and a stationary merchant. His business grew bigger and more prosperous. He paid off the construction team's debt of 52,000 yuan in one go. The bank's handling staff asked in surprise, "Why are you paying off the debt of several hundred people?" He smiled, "Because I am the team leader, because I am a Communist Party member!"

His subordinates heard about this and sighed deeply, unable to contain their emotions. They all knew that Ma Zhanlin's money was hard-earned. On the first day of the second lunar month in 1984, he drove a truck loaded with sheepskins from Maqu to Linxia. Along the way, a sudden strong wind and heavy snow blew, the temperature dropping to minus 30 degrees. At this moment, the truck's oil pipe suddenly froze and cracked. He and the driver immediately repaired it, using rope to bind it, busy for three hours, both frozen stiff. Fortunately, a Tibetan family saved them, preventing them from dying.

After narrowly escaping death, he became wealthy.

In the face of a large sum of money, Ma Zhanlin did not become arrogant. He did not indulge in extravagance, nor did he hoard gold and silver for his descendants. He thought about how to benefit the people. From his ten years of running commune and brigade enterprises, he understood the truth that "without industry, there is no prosperity." He led the construction team out and later engaged in commerce, all for the day when he could establish large enterprises. "Three hearts as one, turning yellow earth into gold." Now they had 33 iron brothers, and they could unfold a grand blueprint. In a few years, they raised funds to establish a leather factory, a wool mill, and a development company, quickly lifting hundreds of farmers out of poverty.

However, he was not satisfied. He remembered the human tragedies he had witnessed during his business travels: many disabled people had no jobs, forced by poverty to beg on the streets, moaning in pain at the bottom of society; there were also many impoverished households suffering from hunger and cold, with no way to get rich; and the demobilized soldiers who had fought on the old mountain frontlines also needed jobs when they returned home... Every time he thought of this, he felt anxious, and a sense of sacred social responsibility surged within him. A solemn voice echoed in his ears: "You, Ma Zhanlin, should help your poor brothers!" He discussed with his companions and decided to establish a social welfare wool factory. This idea was also supported by the provincial and municipal civil affairs bureaus.

Thus, more than 170 disabled people joyfully entered the factory, doing work within their abilities, receiving a monthly salary of 126 yuan, and living in apartments with good health care. The rest of the hundreds of workers were mostly demobilized soldiers and children of impoverished households. But they all had a high school education after strict examinations. This was Ma Zhanlin's unique insight. He wanted to establish a modern factory. He deeply understood that advanced enterprise management plus high-quality employees equals high-quality products. He recruited workers with high cultural standards, implemented a competitive mechanism within the enterprise, which could promote the emergence of talents. At the same time, he enforced strict discipline in the factory. "To turn free-spirited farmers into disciplined industrial workers, an iron hand is necessary!" This was his mantra. Ma Zhanlin also understood the value of knowledge. As soon as the factory started operations, he hired several engineers from outside at high salaries and spent tens of millions of yuan to purchase a patent. Other factories in Linxia laughed at Ma Zhanlin for being foolish and wasting money. Ma Zhanlin retorted, "Product competition ultimately boils down to scientific and technological competition. Disrespecting knowledge is ignorance." Although it had only been a few months since the factory started operations, his technological advantage had already emerged. Just take the selection of wool, for example. Other factories could only select one or two types, at most three types, while his factory could select eight types, each with its own use and price, with much higher benefits.

Ma Zhanlin was no longer a low-level peasant entrepreneur; he was a reformer with modern consciousness, a proud son of the Loess Plateau. He had rolled on the Loess Plateau for 20 years—spending 10 years in township enterprises and 10 years in the reform tide, and when the Republic reached the age of 40, he had become a "hero."

The car drove up Nanyang Mountain, and Ma Zhanlin's thoughts continued to swirl. Yes, he had been away from home for more than a month, and although the scenery abroad was beautiful, he still missed the grandeur of the Loess Plateau the most. The more advanced others were, the more he longed for his hometown's backwardness. He deeply missed the unforgettable scene before his trip abroad. Hearing that he was going abroad, relatives from all directions came to see him off. Not only were there people from his hometown and county, but also people from other counties and minorities. Zaxi Ma from Luchu said, "Brother, you are the pride of our minority. An eagle cannot always hover over the Loess Plateau; fly to the blue sea and take a look." Old man Wang Youlin from the Dongxiang ethnic group said, "Child, you are representing us to study abroad. Bring back the good experiences of others, and our old yellow dragon should take off too..." Now, finally, he had returned. As soon as he got off the plane, he was stunned. His hometown had sent representatives to welcome him. As the car drove up Nanyang Mountain, the endless firecrackers shook the heavens, and the small hill was densely packed with people. Girls, children, old imams, old elders, and brothers eagerly presented him with red silk flowers. Yes, the children of the Loess Plateau had crossed the ocean and seen the world. Nearly 40 years had passed, and the people of the Loess Plateau had paid a heavy price to break free from isolation and take a historic step.

He shared his experiences abroad with his fellow villagers, reported his observations to the county committee and government leaders, and at the same time proposed his ideas for deepening agricultural reforms, dissolving the administrative structure of two villages and establishing two companies. One is an agricultural company, which will take over all the land, be responsible for cultivation, water conservancy, electricity, roads, fertilizers, pesticides, seeds, and animal husbandry, and at the same time plant grass and trees to green all the barren mountains, creating a "green kingdom"; the other is an enterprise company, which will utilize local resources to develop commerce, processing, and breeding industries. All labor will be reorganized, and township enterprises will invest to push agriculture onto a modern track, so that 30% of the households can quickly get rid of poverty. He also suggested that while greening the barren mountains and beaches, every household in the county should raise sheep and weave carpets, forming a production and sales chain, and striking out with a united fist!

Ma Zhanlin's plan was strongly supported by the county committee and government. They acted quickly, and the two villages under his jurisdiction took immediate action.

When Ma Zhanlin was happy, he sang his favorite song, "Yellow Earth Plateau":

    My home is on the Yellow Earth Plateau,
    The wind blows over the plateau in all four seasons,
    After the northwest wind comes the southeast wind,
    There is no slope in life that cannot be crossed.
    As long as you keep the people in your heart,
    You can overcome all difficulties and hardships.

However, the last two lines were his own composition.

    高原“回民支队”〔报告文学〕
    王雁元
    汽车在黄土高原的“波”峰“浪”谷间游弋，突然，停在一座波峰的顶巅。
    他从车里出来，伫立、远望。
    满眼皆是黄色。
    天空犹如一口硕大无朋的蓝色大铁锅，锅里蒸着无数个山馒头。渐渐地，馒头冒气了，越冒越大，在天地之间弥漫开去。
    “又下土了”！他自语。
    铺天盖地迷蒙蒙一片浑黄。黄得使人心焦，黄的令人窒息。他多么想看到一点别的颜色呵。突然，他发现在一群山包之间，有几个小红点在移动。噢，那可能是姑娘媳妇家在“躲土雨”。慢慢地，小红点一个个闪失了，与山合为一体，钻到哪儿去了？对了，山凹里有几排小土房子。一忽儿，风土将它淹没了。唉，山里女子不会打扮，为什么不穿绿衣绿裤呢？在浑浑沌沌的黄天黄地之中，绿色，哪怕是一点绿色，也能给人以极大的愉悦——那是生命的原色啊！
    风挟着土向上飞旋，旋到他的脚下，旋到他的身上。他急忙裹紧了克罗丁呢大衣，兀自奇怪，为什么自己也穿了一件灰黄色大衣呢？再想想自家的尊容，黝黑的长圆脸，根根直竖的短发，晶亮的眼睛，一身铁疙瘩似的肌肉，活像一座黑铁塔！咱不就是黄土高坡土生土长实实在在的庄稼人么！
    他唱起了他最心爱的歌儿《黄土高坡》：
    我家住在黄土高坡，
    大风从坡上刮过。
    不管是西北风还是东南风，
     都是我的歌我的歌。……
    边唱边舞，他又跳起了迪斯科。
    他刚刚“留洋”回来。今年元月八日，作为甘肃省首批农民企业家考察团团员，他自费访问了泰国、新加坡、香港。回国后在京举行记者招待会，受到农业部副部长的接见；到兰州又向省委省政府领导作了汇报。待他返回临夏时，已是1989年的春节前夕了。
    此刻，这个黄土高原的儿子的胸中，正涌动着绿色的波涛。他想如果把泰国的绿色王国移植到黄土高原该多美啊！那时他的理想，骤然间仿佛变成了现实。可眼下风土却紧紧环绕着他，他只得在风土中腾挪旋转。
    “马厂长，快进来！”
    有人喊他。他的名字叫马占林。作为临夏六家举足轻重的企业的创办者，他还兼任黄泥湾乡经委副主任，两个村的党总支书记哩，而且还是七个清真寺管委会的主任——集一方政治、经济、宗教大权于一身。
    但更形象地说，他可是黄土高原“回民支队”的一员猛将呢！
    汽车继续在千山万壑回旋。
    马占林的思绪同样在回旋。
    就在出国前夕，他陷入极大的苦闷之中，治理整顿，抽紧银根之后，他所创办的企业一下子周转不灵了。特别是社会福利绒毛厂，集资318万元，去年9月才建成投产，刚红火了两个月，就碰上了红灯。那么，六家企业的1000余名职工何以为生呢？尤其是福利厂的残疾人，好不容易进了工厂，难道能让他们再度“待业”？他总想不通，过去寺庙里举办慈善事业，一年不过舍粥三日，那能救济几个穷人？即使皇帝开仓赈灾，又能解救多少灾民？而他创办的福利厂，一次就使那么多残疾人终身有靠，且能养家糊口，这为国家减轻了多少负担！然而，现在眼看一分钱贷款也没有了，企业寸步难行，他也只得跑到兰州找出路去了。
    他以酒浇愁，一杯又一杯；他用烟解闷，一支接一支。他信步来到黄河边、深情地唱着他所喜爱的歌儿：
    不管过去了多少岁月，
    祖祖辈辈留下我。
    留下我一望无际唱着歌，
    还有身边这条黄河。
    望着波涛滚滚的黄河回首往事，他既感到心酸，又感到欣慰。
    他比共和国早诞生17天，生于临夏县黄泥湾一户贫穷的农民家里。
    临夏古称河州，处于黄土、青藏两大高原交汇处，又是汉族农业区向少数民族游牧区的过渡地带，丝绸之路、唐蕃古道皆从这里穿过，历史上的茶马互市，24道贸易关口的遗址至今尚存。生于斯长于斯的回族同胞，向来就有经商的传统。只是因为长期的闭关锁国，使得世代经商的回民也被长期禁锢在贫瘠的黄土高原上。
    他只读了四年小学。在三年困难时期，被迫辍学了。
    1969年，他好不容易进了农机学校。毕业后到公社农机站工作，“白手起家”办起了临夏第一个工厂。他利用下乡知青的关系，从兰州几家大厂求援了一批机器设备和各种原料，搞一些简单的机械加工和木器制作。然而，极左路线仍死死地捆住了他的手脚。他在大夏河边，久久地凝望着土门关无语沉思。这道土门关位于临夏与夏河县交界处，关之南是石头山，关之北为黄土山，关南的大夏河水清清凌凌，关北的大夏河水则浑黄浑黄，莫非这就是两大高原的接合部？古代的茶马互市是否就在这里进行？对，一定是的，那时候，驼铃叮咚，烈马嘶鸣，万头攒动，人声鼎沸，何等的热闹，何等的繁荣！如今，土门关沉默了，公路上人少车稀，只有大夏河水缓缓北去……河水尚且可以流通，难道活人就不能流动？难道社会主义等于一穷二白？难道我们永远守着一抔黄土潦倒终生？他忘不了一个工值一毛四分钱的日子，他忘不了三九天光屁股的娃娃，衣不遮体的姑娘。他多么想冲破这黄土高原的封闭，让父老乡亲过上富裕舒坦的日子呵！
    共和国到了而立之年成熟了，尽管太晚了一点。改革开放的春风一漫上黄土高坡，临夏的回民便率先踏上了丝绸之路、唐蕃古道，开始了致富的远征。
    黄泥湾的“回民支队”整装出发了。
    大风萧萧，夏河滔滔，在喜鹊欢叫声中，黄泥湾为壮士们送行。马占林率领他的部下庄严地向父老乡亲宣誓：“为了斩断穷根，为了不再一无所有，我们发誓用勤劳的双手抱个金娃娃回来！”
      “回民支队”活跃在青藏、甘南、黄土三大高原上，开山、修桥、铺路、抢险。他们喝着苦水，啃着干粮，干着最苦最累的活；以后到玛曲修渔场，修军马场，起楼房；再往后，分成四个小分队，到各地承包土木工程。
    他们中的多数是文盲，一干起土木工程来便成了睁眼瞎。马占林买了几百元的书，和马国良、肖建中等有文化的人共同研读，逐步学会了识图、预算、概算，以及工程设计。这些种子又去教其他人，从人口手刀一二三四开始，使之慢慢“脱盲”。
    马占林的队伍开上青藏高原，在荒凉的大山里架起帐篷。那里没有草没有树，只有光秃秃、白晃晃的高山峻岭。他们的日子过得真艰苦！每天上山采石，从50度的陡坡背着大石头下来，一步不慎便会滚下谷底。他们起早贪黑地干，一天才挣三元钱。不幸的事终于发生了，一个小伙子被滚石砸死，马占林抱住战友的尸体哭得死去活来……但是，他和他的支队并没有被死亡与挫折吓倒。他们按照伊斯兰教的礼仪埋葬了战友，擦干了眼泪，又继续前进了，他们来到刘家峡至西固的公路抢险，那里的山体滑坡，阻塞了公路。前不着村后不着店，只得住在潮湿阴暗的破窑洞里。但是，由于变更预算，误工34天，他们白吃了一卡车面粉，亏损1万多。以后开工了，不分昼夜突击。一班干下来，浑身像散了架子。马占林面壁而卧，双腿染上了严重的风湿关节炎，痛得钻心，连起坐都十分困难。
    几年工程下来，马占林回民支队的队员们个个小有积蓄，但是工程队却亏了5.2万元。他没有让大伙掏腰包，自己全认了，然后领着大伙儿跑开了买卖。前几年的万里奔波，走南闯北，使他们对各地的行情了如指掌，跑起来倒也十分顺溜。
    马占林旗开得胜。他从河曲军马场买了40多匹母马，包了三个车皮运到关中。刚刚包产到组的关中农民正缺大牲畜，一看他的河曲马，体态匀称健美，持久力强，挽乘兼用，为一代名马，很快被抢购一空。马占林敏锐地看到，随着内地经济开放搞活，临夏势将成为中国一大皮毛集散地。他于是在临夏市南龙乡尕丁家办起了富民旅社，接待来往客商，广交朋友，收集信息；又办了畜产品购销站，既当行商又当坐商。他的买卖越做越大越做越红火。他把工程队欠债5.2万元一次还清了。银行经办人员吃惊地问：“几百人欠的钱为什么你一人还？”他笑笑：“因为我是队长，因为我是共产党员！”
    他的部下闻说此事，感叹良久不能自已。他们都知道马占林的钱来之不易，是苦挣下的。1984年二九的第一天，他押了一车羊皮从玛曲向临夏开车，途中，骤然刮起大风，下了大雪，气温降到零下30多度。这时，卡车的输油管偏偏冻裂了。他和司机立时抢修，用麻绳捆扎，忙乎了三个小时，两人都冻僵了。幸亏一户藏民救助，使他们免于一死。
    大难不死，必有洪福。马占林富了。
    在巨额金钱面前，马占林没有飘飘然，他不像有人那样穷奢极欲吃喝玩乐，也不像有人那样储备金银留给儿孙。他想的是如何造福于民。他从十年办社队企业中明白了无工不富的道理，他领工程队外出以至后来经商，就是为了有朝一日大办企业。“三人一条心，黄土变成金”。现在他们有33个铁杆弟兄，就能大展宏图了。几年之内，他们集资办了皮革厂、毛纺厂、开发公司，使数百农民迅速脱贫。
    然而，他并不满足，他想起在他的商旅生涯中目睹的人间悲剧：许多残疾人就业无着，迫于生计而沿街行乞，在社会的最底层痛苦地呻吟；还有不少特困户啼饥号寒，找不到致富门路；而那些曾在老山前线浴血奋战的复员军人，回到家乡后也要就业……每念及此他就惶惶不安，一股神圣的社会责任感油然而生。一个庄严的声音在他耳畔轰响：“你，马占林，应当帮助贫苦的兄弟！”他与同伴们核计，决心办一个社会福利绒毛厂。这个设想还得到省、州民政局的支持。
    就这样，170多名残疾人欢天喜地进厂了，干力所能及的工作，月工资开126元，而且住上了公寓，得到良好的卫生保健。其余的数百工人多为复员军人和特困户子女。但都经过严格考核，具有高中毕业文化。这是马占林独具慧眼之处。他要办的是现代化工厂。他深深懂得：高明的企业管理加高度的职工素质等于高超的产品质量。他招进文化素质高的工人，在企业内部实行竞争机制，就能促进人才脱颖而出。同时他在工厂实行了铁的纪律。“要把自由散漫的农民，改造成为训练有素的产业工人，非有铁的手腕不可！这是他的口头禅。马占林更懂得知识的价值。工厂开工伊始，他就从外地高薪聘请了几位工程师，不惜花数十万重金，购买一项专利。临夏其他工厂笑马占林冒傻气花冤枉钱。马占林回敬道：“产品竞争，归根结底是科学技术竞争。不尊重知识才是无知。”虽然仅仅开工数月，他的技术优势便显示出来了。就拿选毛来说，别的厂一般只能选一两种、最多三种，他的厂能选出八种，各有各的用途，各有各的价格，效益高出了许多。
    马占林已不是低层次的农民企业家了，他是具有现代化意识的改革家，黄土高原的一代骄子。他在黄土高坡上滚了20年——在乡镇企业熬炼了10年，又在改革大潮中搏击了10年，当共和国进入不惑之年，他已经成了“人杰”了。
    汽车开上了南阳山，马占林的思绪仍在回旋。是呵，离开家乡一个多月了，在国外浏览花花世界，风光尽管旖旎，但他还是最怀恋黄土高原的壮美。人家越是先进，他越发挂念家乡的落后。他无限深情地想起了出国前那难忘的一幕。听说他要出国，四面八方的乡亲都赶来送行。不仅有本乡本土的人，还有外乡外县的少数民族。碌曲的藏胞扎西玛说：“兄弟，你是我们少数民族的光荣，雄鹰不能总在黄土高原上头盘旋，飞到蓝色的大海去看看吧。”东乡族老人王有林说：
  “孩子，你是代表我们去留洋的，把别人的好经验取回来，咱们这条老黄龙也该起飞了”……现在，终于回来了，一下飞机他愣住了，家乡派了代表来欢迎他。车上南阳山，经久不息的鞭炮惊天动地，小坡上密密麻麻站满了人，姑娘们，孩子们，老阿訇，老太爷，弟兄们争相给他献上绸子大红花。是啊，黄土高坡的孩子飘洋过海，见了大世面回来了。将近40年啊，黄土高原的人付出了多么沉重的代价，才冲破了封闭，迈出了历史性的一步。
    他向乡亲们讲了国外的见闻，他向县委县府领导汇报了自己的观感，同时提出了深化农业改革的设想，将两个村的建制撤销，成立两个公司，一个是农业公司，对全部土地总承包，统一负责耕种、水利、电力、道路、化肥、农药、种子、畜牧，同时种草种树，绿化所有荒山，搞它一个“绿色王国”；另一个是企业公司，利用当地资源，发展商业、加工业、养殖业，所有劳力重新组合，乡镇企业进行投资，把农业推向现代轨道，使30％的农户尽快脱贫。他还建议，在绿化荒山荒滩的同时，全县千家万户养羊，千家万户织地毯，形成产销一条龙，攥成一个拳头向外打！
    马占林的设想得到县委县政府的大力支持。说干就干，他所管辖的两个村迅速行动起来了。
    马占林高兴的时候，又唱起了那首《黄土高坡》：
      我家住在黄土高坡，
      四季风从坡上刮过，
      西北风过了就来东南风，
      人生没有过不去的坡。
      只要你心中记挂着人民，
      千难万险也能闯过。
      不过，后边的那两句词儿，是他自个编的。
