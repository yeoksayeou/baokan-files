    In Longli County, Guizhou Province, this year marks the fourth consecutive year of severe drought. In the face of this drought, the county, in addition to planting 100,000 mu of rice as planned, has also dispatched tobacco technology experts from the county, district, and township tobacco departments to the tobacco-growing areas. These experts are helping farmers combat the drought by cultivating seedlings and standardizing the transplantation of high-quality tobacco varieties such as "K326" and "North Carolina 82" over 30,000 mu. The image shows young farmers at the Pingxi New Reclamation Tobacco Field applying fertilizer to the tobacco seedlings on high beds.
