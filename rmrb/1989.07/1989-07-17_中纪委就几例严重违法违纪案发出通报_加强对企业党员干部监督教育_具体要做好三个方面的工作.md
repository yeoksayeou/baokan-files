**Notice from the Central Discipline Inspection Commission: Strengthening Supervision and Education of Party Members and Cadres in Enterprises**

In recent years, a small number of party members and cadres, including some leading cadres in enterprises, have repeatedly violated party discipline. Some have even blatantly disregarded party and state laws, seeking personal gain at the expense of public interests, engaging in embezzlement, bribery, and extortion, and degenerating into corrupt elements. Several cases are reported here to serve as a warning to all party members, especially those in enterprises.

Former Deputy Director of the Daqing Petrochemical General Plant and Vice Chairman of the Daqing Petrochemical General Plant Enterprise Management Consulting Committee, Guan Wenbin, between May and August 1988, used his position to help others purchase petrochemical products four times and received bribes totaling 27,000 yuan from the buyers. The Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee has decided to expel him from the party and recommends that the administrative department revoke his deputy ministerial-level position, and the judicial authorities will handle him according to law. Former Director and Party Secretary of Kunming Third Textile Factory, Zhang Shizhong, during his tenure, took advantage of the shortage of cloth and yarn in the market and the price "dual-track" system. He colluded with outsiders to buy and sell 99,840 meters of cloth and 77.5 tons of yarn, extorting 49,000 yuan. Additionally, 38 pieces of gold and silver jewelry were found in his home. The Kunming Municipal Party Committee has decided to expel Zhang Shizhong from the party, and the judicial authorities have arrested him according to law.

Former Party Member and Vice General Manager of the Chinese side of the Shanghai Shanhong Construction Engineering Co., Ltd., Dong Fujin, from the end of 1986 to October 1988, used his power to allocate construction projects to receive bribes totaling 105,000 yuan. The Shanghai Construction Bureau Party Committee has expelled him from the party, and the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court has sentenced him to life imprisonment.

Former Manager of the Qingdao Zhongye Commodity Housing Company, Zhang Xinran, used his position to assign the demolition of old buildings to a construction team composed of his relatives from his hometown. He provided the construction team with the bank account of the Qingdao Hua'an Company's Taidong Branch Wood Processing Factory and used various means to transfer a large sum of money from the Zhongye Commodity Housing Company to this bank account. He then used fake payrolls to withdraw the public funds and share them privately, with Zhang receiving 120,000 yuan. During this period, Zhang Xinran also extorted and accepted bribes totaling 90,000 yuan. The relevant party organizations in Qingdao have expelled Zhang Xinran from the party, and the Qingdao Procuratorate, after investigation and prosecution, has filed a lawsuit with the Qingdao Intermediate People's Court.

The above violations of discipline and law not only severely corrupt the party's body, pollute party and social ethics, but also damage the image of socialist enterprises, tarnish the reputation of reform, disrupt the economic environment, and hinder the smooth progress of reform. The relevant party organizations and departments have given them severe punishments, which is entirely correct and necessary.

The serious violations of law and discipline by some party members and cadres in enterprises are not accidental. People like Guan Wenbin and Zhang Shizhong were not inherently bad. They had made some achievements in enterprise reform and were even considered "star" figures with many accolades. However, they relaxed their ideological transformation while making achievements and contributing to their careers. They failed in the face of the test of governance and reform and opening up, and in the struggle against corruption and anti-corruption. There are profound lessons here that we must deeply reflect on and learn from. We must seriously implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, adhere to the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and unswervingly promote reform and opening up. While promoting the construction of socialist material civilization, we must also focus on the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

1. **Strengthen ideological and political work in enterprises.** In a certain period, party ideological and political work has been weakened. In some enterprises, only economic benefits are emphasized, and ideological benefits are ignored. The phenomenon of "only chasing money, not minds" is particularly prominent. Some enterprise party organizations are "party not managing the party," existing in name only, weak and dispersed, resulting in some party members, including party leader cadres, not receiving proper ideological and political education for a long time. Their faith has shaken, their ideals have faded, the great goal of communism has become smaller, and personal small calculations have become larger, eventually leading to degeneration and falling into the abyss of crime. Guan Wenbin, Zhang Shizhong, Dong Fujin, and Zhang Xinran are typical examples. On one hand, they did some beneficial things in the tide of reform and opening up, but on the other hand, due to the relaxation of ideological and political education, the pursuit of enjoyment, and the idea of "everything for money" began to grow in them. Faced with the colorful material world and the temptation of money after the development of commodity economy, their personalism became malignant, and the wrong ideas of "not grabbing is a loss" and "power not used is wasted" rapidly increased. They started from enjoying life, pursuing luxury, eating and drinking, and accepting gifts, to taking advantage of reform loopholes, exchanging power for money, engaging in power-money transactions, and extorting and accepting bribes on a large scale, embezzling public funds, and eventually going further and further down the path of crime. The painful lessons tell us that ideological and political work is an important guarantee for strengthening the construction of the party in enterprises and promoting enterprise reform. It must not be neglected at any time or under any circumstances. Otherwise, the ideological and political field will be lost, and various non-proletarian thoughts will inevitably take advantage of the situation, corrupting our ranks, ruining a batch of party cadres, and causing losses to the party's cause. Therefore, under the conditions of reform and opening up and the development of socialist commodity economy, the party organizations and discipline inspection agencies in enterprises must seriously implement the "two-handed" policy, overcome the situation of one hand being strong and the other being weak. They must attach great importance to ideological and political work, strengthen the education of party style and discipline for party members, improve the ideological and political quality of party cadres, and enhance their ability to resist corruption and degeneration.

2. **Fully play the supervisory and guarantee role of enterprise party organizations.** After the implementation of the factory director responsibility system, some enterprises' party organizations have weak combat effectiveness and have not been able to fully play their supervisory and guarantee roles. They lack a set of strong education, management, and supervision systems and measures for party members and cadres. Zhang Xinran was investigated by the procuratorate for economic issues as early as 1982, but was appointed as the manager because of his work ability and courage. After the company was established, a party branch was not established for a long time, and later, a party branch was established separately, with Zhang Xinran serving as the secretary. The party organization was weak and dispersed, and there was no question of supervision. The higher-level party committee did not study the party's work, spiritual civilization construction, and ideological and political work in the Zhongye Commodity Housing Company for a long time, relaxed leadership, and did not seriously warn Zhang about the problems reported by the masses, resulting in the lack of supervision and restraint, and eventually falling back into crime and unable to extricate himself. The facts once again show that power without supervision and restraint will lead to corruption. No matter who it is, without the supervision of the party organization and the masses, mistakes will be made, and even crimes will be committed. Therefore, in the process of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively, all levels of party committees must attach great importance to strengthening the construction of the party in enterprises, and work hard to study and solve new situations and problems encountered in party building, and improve the combat effectiveness of enterprise party organizations. A supervisory mechanism should be gradually established and improved within the enterprise party organization, and a set of effective measures should be formulated to ensure that every party member and cadre is truly under the supervision of the party and the masses, constantly cleanse themselves of impurities, maintain the purity of communists, and withstand the test of governance and reform and opening up.

3. **Strengthen the institutional construction of enterprises to ensure the cleanliness of party members and cadres.** The degeneration of Guan Wenbin and others reminds us from the opposite side that maintaining cleanliness is not only a requirement for party members and cadres in party and government organs but also a common requirement for all communists on all fronts and at all work posts. As long as one is a communist, one must be clean and upright. Whether in party and government organs or in enterprises and institutions, the atmosphere of hard work, fighting corruption, and advocating cleanliness must be established. With the development of reform and socialist commodity economy, the power of enterprises has relatively expanded, and the directors and managers hold the power over personnel, finance, materials, and production, supply, and sales. This requires the establishment of a corresponding set of rules and regulations to supervise and restrain enterprise party members and cadres in the correct exercise of their power and to prevent corruption and violations of law and discipline. The party organizations and discipline inspection agencies in enterprises must strengthen the study of relevant rules and regulations for maintaining cleanliness, and once formulated, they must seriously implement them. Broad masses of enterprise party members and cadres, especially leading cadres, must model the observance of party discipline and state laws and regulations, model the observance of various rules and regulations, and voluntarily accept the supervision of the party and the masses, and make new contributions to the construction of party style and discipline in enterprises and the smooth progress of reform and opening up.

    中纪委就几例严重违法违纪案发出通报
    加强对企业党员干部监督教育
    具体要做好三个方面的工作
    新华社北京7月17日电　中纪委通报：必须加强对企业党员干部的监督和教育
    近些年来，企业里的极少数党员干部甚至领导干部，违反党的纪律的现象不断发生。有的竟然无视党纪国法，见利忘义，损公肥私，贪污受贿索贿，堕落成腐败分子。现通报几例，以使全党同志，特别是企业里的广大党员干部引为戒训。
    原大庆石化总厂副厂长、大庆石化总厂企业管理咨询委员会副主任关文彬，于1988年5月至8月间利用职务之便，先后4次帮助他人购买石化产品，5次收受买主贿赂共2.7万元。黑龙江省委已决定开除其党籍，建议行政主管部门撤销其副厅级职务，由司法机关依法处理。原云南省昆明市第三纺织厂厂长兼党委书记张实忠，在任职期间，趁市场棉布、棉纱紧缺之机，钻价格“双轨制”的空子，利用职权，内外勾结，倒买倒卖棉布99840米、棉纱77.5吨，从中索贿4.9万余元，还依法从他家搜出各种金银戒指、项链、手链等达38件之多。昆明市委已决定开除张实忠的党籍，司法机关依法将其逮捕。
    原上海市建筑工程管理局申港建筑工程有限公司中方党员副总经理董福金，自1986年底至1988年10月，在承建漕河泾住宅区等工程中，利用工程发包权，收受承包人贿赂10.5万元。上海市建工局党委已将其开除党籍，市中级人民法院依法判处其无期徒刑。
    原山东省青岛市振业商品房经营公司经理张新让，利用职务之便，将该公司拆除旧房的工程，交给一支由其原籍亲戚组成的民工施工队，并为施工队非法提供青岛市华安公司台东分公司木材加工厂的银行帐号，以各种手段把振业商品房经营公司的大笔款项转入该银行帐户，再利用制作假工资表的手段，将公款提出合伙私分，张从中分得赃款12万余元。其间，张新让还索贿受贿9万元之巨。青岛市有关党的组织已开除了张新让的党籍，青岛市检察院侦审后已向市中级人民法院提起公诉。
    上述违纪违法行为，不仅严重腐蚀党的肌体，污染党风和社会风气，而且损害了社会主义企业的形象，败坏了改革的声誉，破坏经济环境，扰乱经济秩序，阻碍了改革的顺利进行。有关党的组织和部门对他们的问题给予严厉惩处，是完全正确的、必要的。
    企业里的某些党员干部如此严重地违法乱纪，堕落成腐败分子，不是偶然的。像关文彬、张实忠等这样的人，原来并不是本质很坏的人，他们也曾在企业的改革中做出过一些成绩，有的还是得到不少桂冠的“明星人物”。然而，他们却在工作上做出成绩、事业上作出贡献的同时放松了思想改造，在执政和改革开放的考验面前、在腐蚀与反腐蚀斗争的较量中败下阵来。这里有着非常深刻的教训值得我们深思和汲取。我们一定要认真贯彻党的十三届四中全会的精神，坚持党的“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线，坚定不移地搞好改革开放，在促进社会主义物质文明建设的同时，抓好社会主义的精神文明建设。
    一、必须大力加强企业里的思想政治工作。一个时期以来，党的思想政治工作受到削弱。在一些企业里，只讲经济效益，不讲思想效益，“只抓票子，不抓脑子”的现象尤为突出。甚至有的企业的党组织“党不管党”，形同虚设，软弱涣散，致使一些党员、包括党员领导干部，长期得不到应有的思想政治教育，信仰动摇了，理想淡薄了，共产主义大目标越来越小，个人主义小算盘越打越大，直至蜕化变质，跌入犯罪的泥潭。关文彬、张实忠、董福金、张新让就是这样的典型。一方面他们在改革开放大潮的裹挟下做了一些有益的事情，另一方面由于放松了思想政治教育，追求享受，“一切向钱看”的思想在他们身上开始滋长。面对发展商品经济后五光十色的物质世界和金钱的诱惑，个人主义恶性膨胀，“不捞白不捞”，“有权不用，过期作废”的错误思想急剧增长。他们从贪图享受，追求奢侈，吃吃喝喝，收受礼品开始，到钻改革的空子，以权换钱，搞权钱交易，大肆索贿受贿、侵吞公款，以致在犯罪的道路上越走越远。沉痛的教训告诉我们，思想政治工作是加强企业党的建设，搞好企业改革的重要保证，任何时候、任何情况下都不能忽视。否则，就会丢掉思想政治领域的阵地，各种非无产阶级思想就必然乘虚而入，侵蚀我们的队伍，就会毁掉一批党员干部，使党的事业遭受损失。所以，在改革开放、发展社会主义商品经济的条件下，企业里的党的组织和纪检机关必须认真贯彻“两手抓”的方针，克服一手硬、一手软的状况。要高度重视思想政治工作，加强对党员的党风党纪教育，提高党员干部的思想政治素质，增强防腐拒变的能力。
    二、充分发挥企业党组织的监督保证作用。实行厂长负责制后，一些企业的党组织战斗力不强，没有能充分发挥出应有的监督保证作用，对党员干部缺乏一套强有力的教育、管理和监督制度及措施。张新让早在1982年就曾因经济问题被检察机关审查过，但却因他工作有能力、有魄力而被任命为经理。公司成立后，长时间没有建立党支部，以后单独成立党支部，又由张新让兼任书记，党组织处于软弱涣散状态，根本谈不上监督。上一级党委对振业商品房经营公司党的工作、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，很少研究，放松了领导，对群众反映张的问题更没有严肃地向其敲警钟，使其失去了监督制约，以致故态复萌，陷入犯罪的深渊而不能自拔。事实再次说明，失去监督和制约的权力，就会导致腐败。不管是谁，离开党组织和人民群众的监督，就会犯错误，甚至犯罪。因此，在治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革中，各级党委必须切实重视加强企业党的建设，下功夫研究和解决党的建设中遇到的新情况、新问题，提高企业党组织的战斗力。要逐步建立和完善企业党组织内的监督机制，制定一套行之有效的办法，使每一个党员和党员干部真正置于党和人民群众的监督之下，不断清除自己身上的污垢，保持共产党人的纯洁性，经受住执政和改革开放的考验。
    三、加强企业的制度建设，保证党员干部的廉洁。关文彬等人的堕落从反面提醒我们，保持廉洁，决不仅仅是对党政机关党员干部的要求，而且是对各条战线、各个工作岗位上的所有共产党员的共同要求。只要是共产党员，都必须做到廉洁奉公。不论是党政机关，还是企事业单位，都要树立起艰苦奋斗、肃贪倡廉的风气。随着改革和社会主义商品经济的发展，企业的权力相对扩大，厂长、经理手中掌握着人、财、物和产、供、销的权力，这就需要建立一套相应的规章制度，以监督和制约企业党员干部正确行使自己的权力，防止腐败现象和违法乱纪问题的发生。企业里的党组织和纪检机关要切实加强对保持廉洁有关规章制度的研究，一经制定要认真抓好落实。广大企业党员干部特别是领导干部要模范地遵守党的纪律和国家的法律、法令，模范地遵守各项规章制度，自觉地接受党和人民群众的监督，为搞好企业的党风党纪建设，保证改革开放的顺利进行作出新的贡献。
