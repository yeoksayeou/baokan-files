From the 13th issue of 1989, "Satire and Humor" magazine, by Wāng Jiāmíng.

The image accompanying this article is a satirical cartoon depicting a contemporary scene that draws a parallel to the historical event of the "Burning of Scholars" (坑儒), where scholars were persecuted. The cartoon likely uses exaggerated and humorous elements to critique a specific event or situation from 1989, reflecting the societal and political climate of the time. The exact details of the cartoon are not provided, but the title suggests a critique of the treatment of intellectuals or scholars in a modern context, possibly during the political turmoil of 1989 in China.
