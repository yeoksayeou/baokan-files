	Grenada announced on July 19 that it would establish so-called "diplomatic relations" with China's Taiwan, thereby undermining the basis and principles established in the 1985 Sino-Grenada Joint Communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations. This has created a serious situation of so-called "dual recognition," which cannot but arouse our serious concern.

	The so-called "establishment of diplomatic relations" between Grenada and Taiwan is a serious step taken by the Taiwan authorities, who disregard the strong wish of the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for the peaceful reunification of the motherland and vigorously promote their so-called "flexible diplomacy."

	In recent times, the so-called "flexible diplomacy" and "dual recognition" have been rampant in Taiwan. Some people have openly declared that they want to establish official relations with certain countries that have diplomatic relations with us. This so-called "flexible diplomacy" is actually a means for the Taiwan authorities to escape their extremely isolated situation internationally. Their goal is to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," while "dual recognition" is one of the actual methods of implementing "flexible diplomacy." Although the Taiwan authorities repeatedly claim to adhere to the principle of "one China," they are willing to sacrifice national interests and undermine China's unity for their own private gains, attempting to create a situation of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" internationally. In this regard, they rely on their economic strength, attempting to use it as bait to achieve their ulterior motives. The actions of the Taiwan authorities are firmly opposed by all Chinese people at home and abroad who support the cause of China's peaceful reunification. People must not allow such attempts to split China to succeed.

	The Chinese government's position on the Taiwan issue is very clear: there is only one China, and the Government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China, while Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. An important principle for China to establish formal diplomatic relations with other countries is that the other party recognizes China's position on the Taiwan issue. Therefore, any country that establishes diplomatic relations with China and violates this principle is undermining the basis for the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries, leading to a serious situation of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan," which is a serious infringement on China's sovereignty and is firmly opposed by the Chinese people. We are pleased to see that the vast majority of countries that have established diplomatic relations with us understand, respect, and support China's solemn position on the Taiwan issue. We appreciate this. The Chinese people will ultimately achieve the great cause of national reunification, which is an irresistible trend that no force can stop. There is a Chinese saying: "Those who know the times are heroes." We hope that the Grenadian government will cherish the friendship between the peoples of China and Grenada, consider the long-term interests of the two countries' relations, and correct the mistake of "establishing diplomatic relations" with Taiwan as soon as possible.

	We believe that the world can see clearly the plot of the Taiwan authorities and Grenada to engage in "dual recognition diplomacy." The attempt of the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" through this will not succeed. On the Taiwan issue, we advocate seeking "peaceful reunification" and implementing "one country, two systems." We do not object to Taiwan engaging in economic and trade exchanges of a civilian nature with countries that have established diplomatic relations with us, but we firmly oppose Taiwan establishing official relations or diplomatic relations with these countries. Because doing so will not only harm the friendly relations between China and the countries with which it has established diplomatic relations but will also have adverse effects on world peace and stability. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will consider the interests and overall situation of the Chinese nation and stop activities that are not conducive to national reunification, and work with us to achieve the peaceful reunification of China.

    决不能让“双重承认”的图谋得逞
    本报评论员
    格林纳达于7月19日宣布与中国的台湾建立所谓“外交关系”，从而破坏了1985年中格两国建交公报所确定的基础和原则，造成了一个所谓“双重承认”的严重事态，不能不引起我们的严重关注。
    格台所谓“建交”是台湾当局无视海峡两岸中国人民要求和平统一祖国的强烈愿望、竭力推行其大肆宣扬的所谓“弹性外交”的一个严重步骤。
    近期以来，所谓“弹性外交”、“双重承认”之说在台湾甚嚣尘上，一些人士公然声称要同某些与我建交的国家“发生官方关系”。这种所谓“弹性外交”，实际上是台湾当局为了摆脱在国际上极端孤立困境的一个手段，目的是制造“两个中国”或“一中一台”，而“双重承认”则是“弹性外交”的实际运用手法之一。尽管台湾当局口头上一再声称“坚持一个中国”的原则，但他们为了达到自己的私利，不惜损害民族利益，破坏中国的统一，企图在国际上造成“两个中国”、“一中一台”的局面。在这方面，他们自恃有经济力量，企图以此为诱饵，以达到其不可告人的目的。台湾当局的这种行径，是海内外一切拥护中国和平统一大业的中国人所坚决反对的。对于这种分裂中国的企图，人们决不能让它得逞。
    中国政府在台湾问题上的立场是十分明确的，这就是：只有一个中国，中华人民共和国政府是代表全中国的唯一合法政府，而台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。中国同各国建立正式外交关系的一个重要原则就是对方确认中国在台湾问题上的这一立场。因此，任何同中国建立外交关系的国家如果违背这一原则，就是破坏了两国建交的基础，就会导致“两个中国”或“一中一台”的严重局面，都是对中国主权的严重侵犯，是中国人民坚决反对的。我们高兴地看到，世界上已同我建交的绝大多数国家，都能理解、尊重和支持中国在台湾问题上的严正立场。我们对此表示赞赏。中国人民终究要实现祖国的统一大业，这是大势所趋，是任何力量都阻挡不了的。中国有句俗话说：识时务者为俊杰。我们希望格林纳达政府能以中格两国人民的友谊为重，能从两国关系的长远利益考虑，尽早改正与台湾“建交”的错误。
    我们相信，对于台湾当局与格林纳达搞什么“双重承认外交”，世人是能够看得清楚的。台湾当局想以此来制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”的图谋是不可能得逞的。在台湾问题上，我们主张争取“和平统一”，实行“一国两制”。我们对于台湾地区同与我建交的国家进行民间性质的经济贸易往来不持异议，而对于台湾同这些国家建立官方关系、外交关系，我们则是坚决反对的。因为那样做不仅会损害中国同建交国间的友好关系，还将给世界和平与稳定带来不利影响。我们希望台湾当局能以中华民族的利益和大局为重，停止不利于祖国统一的活动，并进而同我们一起为实现中国的和平统一做出努力。
