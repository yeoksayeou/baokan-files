The Central Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission has issued a circular to the entire military, commending the Party Committee of a certain corps in the Nanjing Military Region for strengthening self-discipline mechanisms and maintaining a spirit of hard work and thrift.

The Party Committee of this corps is known for its strong spirit of hard work and self-reliance. In their personal lives, they adhere to a low standard of living, taking pride in simplicity and refraining from purchasing luxury cars or building grand buildings. They do not seek special treatment in their daily lives. In their work, they maintain high standards, always focusing on the Party's cause and the construction of the military. In recent years, each member of the committee has spent an average of over three months per year in the field, with last year reaching 149 days, including an average of two months of on-site inspections per person, ensuring they eat and live in the units. Currently, the corps' units are stable, with criminal cases and administrative responsibility-related fatalities at an all-time low. For five consecutive years, the rate of administrative responsibility-related fatalities has been below the limit set by the headquarters, and the soldiers praise them as a committee that considers the big picture, upholds discipline, promotes integrity, and works hard.

The Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission, in forwarding the experiences of this corps' Party Committee, pointed out that hard work is a cherished tradition of our Party and our military. It must never be abandoned, and in the new situation of reform and opening up, this revolutionary spirit must be vigorously carried forward.

The circular requires that all levels of Party organizations, especially mid-to-high-level leaders, during the process of studying and implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and Deng Xiaoping's recent important speeches, should closely link theory with practice, learn from the experiences of the Party Committee of this corps, and examine their own and their units' hard work and anti-corruption efforts. They should praise acts of honesty and integrity, take concrete measures to seriously address any existing issues of dishonesty.

    某军党委艰苦奋斗受到表彰
    新华社北京7月13日电  中央军委纪委向全军通报表彰了南京军区某集团军党委常委强化自我约束机制，保持艰苦奋斗、勤俭创业精神的事迹。
    这个集团军党委常委是一个艰苦创业精神比较好的班子。他们在生活上坚持低标准，以俭朴为荣，高级轿车不买，楼堂馆所不盖，生活不搞特殊。在工作上坚持高标准，一心想着党的事业和部队建设。近几年，常委成员每年人均下部队都在3个月以上，去年达到149天，其中每人平均蹲点2个月左右，做到吃住在连队。目前，集团军部队稳定，刑事案件和行政责任亡人事故降到历史最低点，连续5年行政责任事故亡人率低于总部限定的比例，官兵赞扬他们是一个顾大局，守纪律，讲廉洁，干事业的班子。
    军委纪委在转发这个集团军党委常委的经验时指出，艰苦奋斗，是我党我军的传家宝。任何时候都不能丢掉，在坚持改革开放的新形势下，更要大力发扬这种革命精神。
    通报要求各级党组织，特别是中高级领导干部，在学习贯彻十三届四中全会精神和邓小平同志最近几次重要讲话过程中，应密切联系实际，参考某集团军党委常委的经验，检查一下自己和本单位艰苦创业、惩治腐败的情况。表扬廉洁奉公的好人好事，采取切实措施，把已经发生的不廉洁现象认真加以解决。
