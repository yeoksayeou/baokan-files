Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, July 10th.

Military delegations from India and Pakistan held talks today to discuss the territorial dispute over Siachen.

The talks will last for two days, with the main agenda being the establishment of a joint military committee to demarcate the boundaries of the two countries' forces in the Siachen Glacier, aiming to prevent armed conflicts.

The Siachen Glacier is located in the northern part of Kashmir, covering an area of 3,000 square kilometers. Both India and Pakistan claim sovereignty over this region. Since 1984, armed conflicts have frequently occurred between the two sides in this area. So far, five rounds of defense secretary-level talks have been held between the two countries regarding this dispute.

    新华社新德里7月10日电  印度和巴基斯坦两国军事代表团今天在此举行会谈，以讨论锡亚琴领土争端问题。
    会谈将举行两天，主要议题是，讨论设立一个联合军事委员会，为在锡亚琴冰川的两国军队划定界线，以避免武装冲突。
    锡亚琴冰川位于克什米尔北部，面积为3000平方公里，印巴双方都声称对这一地区拥有主权。自1984年起，印巴双方在这个地区经常发生武装冲突。迄今为止，双方就该地区争端问题举行了5轮国防秘书级会谈。
