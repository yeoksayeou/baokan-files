People's Daily reporter Mei Hongru reports: Vice Premier Wu Xueqian on July 13 at the sixth meeting of the National Tourism Commission pointed out: We should have full confidence to overcome the temporary difficulties faced by the tourism industry.

He said: The struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion has already achieved decisive victory; the Chinese government has clearly stated that the policies and guidelines formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee remain unchanged, and we will continue to move forward on the path of reform and opening up. As the truth about the counter-revolutionary rebellion becomes known to the public, the influence of rumors and reactionary propaganda spread by foreign news media will gradually be eliminated. Comrades in the tourism sector should build confidence, do more work, and strive to gradually change the difficult situation caused by the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the tourism industry.

Wu Xueqian pointed out that we should seize the current opportunity to seriously rectify the tourism industry. During this rectification, we must seriously eliminate corruption and unhealthy tendencies. We should combine theory with practice, strengthen ideological and political education and professional training for the vast number of tourism workers, and improve service quality and management level. For some tourism enterprises with chaotic management and poor economic benefits, we must urgently rectify them to help them quickly change their appearance.

Wu Xueqian also mentioned that we should think of more ways and open up more channels. We can implement temporary preferential prices; develop more different tourism routes for tourists to choose from; open up more overseas tourist sources, and so on.

Director Liu Yi of the National Tourism Administration reported at the meeting on the losses suffered by China's tourism industry due to the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, as well as the measures and plans taken by the National Tourism Administration to revitalize the tourism industry. Li Chang'an and Hao Jianxiu also attended the meeting.
