Title: Beware of Falling Through Yourself

In his essay "Transparent," Lu Xun criticized a kind of "transparent" theory. For example, "previously, opposing the literature of moral guardianship was to say that the cannibalistic 'way' should not be defended, but some people want to be transparent, saying that no 'way' should be defended"; to oppose the eight-legged essay, so "one must know that the earth is round, and everyone must travel around the earth once; those who want to make steam engines must first sit in front of a boiling kettle to investigate things." Lu Xun believed that this kind of theory "is not necessarily brilliant," because this kind of "transparent" theory is "transparent," unfortunately, it also "leaks" its own propositions, leaving only a bottomless pit.

I feel that some of our literary theories and critical articles have a lot of this "transparent" spirit, and thus "leak" through "transparency." Below are some examples, hoping to draw attention, so that we do not "leak" ourselves (this "ourselves" of course includes myself).

Someone says: "Never read 'literary theory.'"

I think: "Never read 'literary theory,'" this itself is literary theory. Those who truly advocate "never read 'literary theory'" should not say a single word of literary theory, nor write a single literary theory article. If they do say or write, it means they want others to listen or read. Could it be that only their own literary theory is the real literary theory that should be read, while other "literary theories" (especially Marxist literary theory) are all fake "literary theories" that should not be read? Is this really so arrogant?

Someone says: "Writers should first think of a theme before writing, which does not conform to the law of creation."

I think: "First think of a theme before writing," such creation, indeed many have failed (especially when completing the current direct political tasks), but there are also successes. In China, there is "Midnight" (and not just "Midnight"), and abroad, there is "Destruction" (and not just "Destruction"). Therefore, if it is not someone else "demanding," but the writer themselves "first thinking of a theme" in the process of life and creation practice, and then writing, such creation should not be classified as "another category."

Someone says: "I don't believe that a film can reform the audience. Proposing such a function is imposing too heavy a burden on art, which is unscientific, against the law, and not conducive to the development of film art."

I think: Yes, I don't believe it either. I believe that those with a bit of literary knowledge hardly believe it. However, it is best to specify who, where, and when said that "a film can reform the audience," and how it was said. Otherwise, it will also be seen as raising one's own "stone." This is one. Two, a film can indeed have different aspects (such as thought, emotion, morality, will, temperament, interest, cultural education, etc.) on the audience, to a greater or lesser extent, drop by drop, in varying degrees, this is subtle influence; if it is not like this, completely denying the effect of each film, it is also a complete denial of the entire film art, in this way, this film thing, is it worth spending so much money on? Which theory is "not conducive to the development of film art"?

Someone says: "Literature and people are always connected. Without people, there is no literature. Therefore, the development of literature and people's self-discovery are inseparable."

I think: Without people, can there be anthropology, psychology, medicine, sociology, history? Without people—as the subject of study, can there be astronomy, mineralogy, physics, and chemistry? It is best to prove that without people, there can be such and such "science," otherwise, "without people, there is no literature," it seems empty, as if nothing is said, it does not count as a theory.

Someone says: "Never hope for absolute truth."

I think: I don't know if this "never hope for absolute truth" is "absolute truth." If it is, then "absolute truth" is already here, no need to "hope"; if it is not, then we do not need to follow it, it is still better to "hope" a bit, "hope" that humanity in the process of "practice—cognition—practice" infinite repetition, gradually recognizes the components of absolute truth, and thus gradually approaches absolute truth.

Someone says: "I doubt that any view can attract me now."

I think: This is good. However, I do not doubt that this literary theorist was attracted by the "view" of "no view can attract me" when making this judgment.

Someone says: "No ideological theory is beyond doubt."

I think: Completely correct, with only a tiny addition: it is best to include the theory of "no ideological theory is beyond doubt" within this. Only then is it complete, only then is it thorough.

Someone says: "When I hear people talking about summarizing the literature of the new era, I seem to have a worried feeling. Because in the face of various literary phenomena, almost every summary is at the expense of other angles, other aspects of observation, or at the expense of other facts. If a good theoretical article summarizes the characteristics of fifty out of a hundred novels, then it is at the expense of the other fifty novels. If a good article summarizes the most important achievements and shortcomings of a writer's work, then it often sacrifices the writer's less important, but not necessarily unimportant, sometimes perhaps more important aspects." "Theorists are a bit naive."

I think: To regard this passage as a kind of "summary" is probably not wrong. Then, what is this "summary" at the expense of? It seems that with this "summary," there is no need and it is not possible to make any theoretical summary of the literature of the new era. "Sacrificing" all other theoretical summaries of the literature of the new era is the "cost" of this "summary." This "cost" is indeed not small! "Summarizing" the characteristics of fifty out of a hundred novels is at the expense of the other fifty. Then, if there are two thousand writers in the country, "summarizing" one thousand is at the expense of the other thousand, "summarizing" novels is at the expense of poetry, "summarizing" literature is to "sacrifice" perhaps more important art; you "summarize" the earth, maybe you "sacrifice" the moon, "summarize" the earth and the moon, and "sacrifice" the more important sun! How can this be! "Theorists are a bit naive." Yes. The person who made the above "summary" is what kind of person, is he also a bit "naive"? What kind of "naive"? How much? I can't think of it, nor can I be sure.

Someone says: "There is nothing that is beyond doubt."

I think: I don't know if the existence of a planet called Earth in the universe in January 1989 is also a "thing" that can be "doubted," I don't know if the fact that the Earth orbits the Sun is also a "thing" that can be "doubted." To oppose the eight-legged essay and prove that the Earth is round, it is indeed troublesome to have everyone travel around the Earth once, but if after traveling around and coming back, one still "doubts" whether the Earth is round, how can one live?

Speaking and writing articles, one should not talk recklessly without regard to facts, nor should one go to extremes, or jump from one extreme to another. We have suffered great losses from this kind of thinking and method. With this kind of thinking and method, one can argue that a thing (or a writer, a work) is utterly evil, or that it (he) is perfect. People are used to calling this kind of thinking and method subjectivism and metaphysics.

With subjective arbitrariness, treating things one-sidedly, it is only satisfying to speak, and it may even produce a temporary "sensation," but it cannot explore the truth, nor can it solve any problems. Moreover, it is often full of loopholes, and one cannot even defend oneself, let alone convince others?

It is still better to use materialist dialectics, still better to be practical. Speaking should have factual basis, should accept the test of reality, and at the same time should strive to be comprehensive (saying "strive to be comprehensive" is because one-sidedness is inevitable). Only by adopting this kind of thinking and method can one discover and develop the truth in the process of exploration.

    当心自己也漏下去
    马畏安
    （一）
    鲁迅在《透底》一文中，批评过一种“透底”的理论。比如，“从前反对卫道文学，原是说那样吃人的‘道’不应该卫，而有人要透底，就说什么道也不卫”；要反对八股，于是乎“要知道地球是圆的，人人都要环游地球一周；要制造汽机的，也要先坐在开水壶前格物”。鲁迅认为，这种理论“不见得高明”，因为这种理论“透底”是“透底”了，可惜连它的主张本身也“漏掉”了，“只剩得一个无底洞”。
    我觉得我们的一些文学理论和评论文章，“透底”气不少，也就由“透”而“漏”了。下面举一些例子，希望引起注意，别连自己（这“自己”当然也包括我自己）也漏下去。
    （二）
    有人说：“千万不要读‘文学理论’。”
    我想：“千万不要读‘文学理论’”，这本身就是文学理论。真正主张“千万不要读‘文学理论’”，就应当一句文学理论的话也不说，一篇文学理论的文章也不写。说了，就是让人听；写了，就是要人读的。莫非只有自己这一家的文学理论才是不带引号的文学理论，应该读；其他的“文学理论”（尤其是马克思主义文学理论），都是带引号的伪“文学理论”，都不能读？真有这么霸道吗？
    有人说：“要作家事先想好一个主题才写，不符合创作规律。”
    我想：“事先想好一个主题才写”，这样的创作，失败的的确不少（尤其是在为了完成当前的直接政治任务的时候），然而，也有成功的，中国的就有《子夜》（而且绝非仅仅一部《子夜》），外国的也有《毁灭》（也绝非仅仅一部《毁灭》）。因此，假如不是别人“要”，而是作家在生活和创作实践过程中自己“事先想好一个主题”，然后才写，这样的创作，最好不要打入“另册”。
    有人说：“说通过一部影片能改造观众，我不信。提出这样的功能，就是对艺术施加了过重的负担，是不科学的，违反规律的，不利于电影艺术的发展。”
    我想：是的，我也不信。我相信稍有一点文艺常识的人没有几个相信。不过，最好也标明是谁、在什么地方、什么时候，“说”过“通过一部影片能改造观众”这样的话，怎么“说”的。不然的话，也要被看作是垫高自己的“石头”。这是一。二，一部影片，还真的能在不同方面（如思想、感情、道德、意志、情操、旨趣、文化教养，等等），对观众起着多多少少的、点点滴滴的、程度不同的作用，这就是潜移默化；倘不是这样，完全不承认一部部影片的作用，也就彻底否定了整个电影艺术的作用，这样一来，电影这劳什子，哪值得花那么多钱去搞？究竟哪一种理论“不利于电影艺术的发展”呢？
    有人说：“文学和人总是联系在一起的。没有人，也就无所谓文学。因此，文学的发展进程和人对自身的发现是密不可分的。”
    我想：没有人，难道可以有人类学、心理学、医学、社会学、历史学？没有人——作为研究主体的人，难道可以有天文学、矿物学、物理学和化学？最好证明一下，没有人可以有上述这样那样的“学”，不然，“没有人，也就无所谓文学”，就显得空空洞洞，等于没说，算不上什么理论。
    有人说：“永远不奢望绝对真理。”
    我想：不知道这“永远不奢望绝对真理”是不是“绝对真理”。如果是的，那么，“绝对真理”便已经站在这里了，用不着“奢望”；如果不是，那么，我们就不必服膺，还是不妨“奢望”一下好，“奢望”人类在“实践——认识——实践”无限反复的过程中，不断认识绝对真理的某些成分，从而逐渐接近绝对真理。
    有人说：“我怀疑现在还有什么见解还能吸引我。”
    我想：这很好。不过，我倒不怀疑这位文学理论家在下这个断语的时候，已经被“没有什么见解能吸引我”这个“见解”吸引住了。
    有人说：“没有任何一种意识形态理论是毋庸置疑的。”
    我想：完全正确，要补充的只有一丁点儿：最好把“没有任何一种意识形态理论是毋庸置疑的”这个理论也包括在内。这样才完全，才彻底。
    有人说：“听到人们要概括新时期的文学的时候，似乎有一种忧心忡忡的情绪。因为在多种多样的文学现象面前，几乎每一种概括都是以牺牲其它角度、其它侧面的观察，或是牺牲其它事实为代价的。如果一篇很好的理论文章概括了一百篇小说里的五十篇的特点，那么，也是以牺牲另外五十篇小说为代价的。如果一篇很好的文章概括了一个作家的一篇作品里边的最主要的成就和缺陷，那么，也常常是以牺牲这个作家的虽然次要、但不见得不重要、有时也许更重要的那些方面为代价的。”“理论家未免带几分呆气。”
    我想：把这段话也看作是一种“概括”，大概是不会错的。那么，这个“概括”是以“牺牲”什么为“代价”的呢？看来，有了这个“概括”，就没有必要、也不可能对新时期文学作任何理论概括了。“牺牲”对新时期文学的其它一切理论概括，就是这个“概括”的“代价”。这个“代价”着实不小啊！“概括”了一百篇小说中五十篇的特点，就“牺牲”了另外五十篇。那么，如果全国有两千个作家，“概括”了这一千个，就“牺牲”了另一千个，“概括”了小说，就“牺牲”了诗歌，“概括”了文学，就要“牺牲”“也许更重要的”艺术；你就是“概括”了地球，也许就“牺牲”了月亮，“概括”了地球和月亮，又
  “牺牲”了“更重要的”太阳！这怎么得了！“理论家未免带几分呆气”。是的。作出上面这一大段“概括”的什么什么家，是不是也带“几分”什么“气”呢？什么“气”？有“几分”？一时还想不清，也说不准。
    有人说：“没有什么事物是毋庸置疑的。”
    我想：不知道1989年1月，宇宙中存在着一个叫做地球的行星这件“事物”是不是也可以“置疑”，不知道地球是围绕太阳旋转的这件“事物”是不是也可以“置疑”。为了反对八股，论证地球是圆的，就要人人都环游地球一周，这固然烦难，倘若绕了一周回来以后，对地球究竟是不是圆的，还要“置疑”，那日子可怎么过？
    （三）
    说话写文章，最好不要不顾事实地信口开河，也不要走极端，或者从一个极端跳到另一个极端。我们吃过这种思想和方法的大亏。用这种思想和方法，可以论证一件事物（或一个作家、一部作品）十恶不赦，也可以论证它（他）完美无缺。人们习惯称这种思想和方法为主观主义和形而上学。
    凭着主观随意性，用片面性对待事物，不过说的时候痛快罢了，也许还能产生一时的“轰动效应”，但是却探索不到真理，也不能解决任何问题。不仅如此，还常常漏洞百出，连自己都不能自圆其说，又怎么能说服人呢？
    还是唯物辩证法好，还是实事求是好。说话要有事实根据，要接受实际的检验，同时也要力求全面（说“力求全面”，是因为片面性在所难免）。只有采取这样的思想和方法，才能在探索中发现和发展真理。
