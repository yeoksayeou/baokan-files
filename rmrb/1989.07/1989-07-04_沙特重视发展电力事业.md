Saudi Arabia is vast in territory but sparse in population, with significant differences between urban and rural areas. With the continuous increase in oil revenues, various construction projects are thriving. How to meet the electricity needs of urban and rural residents and construction projects is an important task facing the Saudi government.

The Saudi government attaches great importance to the development of the electric power industry. After years of unremitting efforts, it has achieved fruitful results. Saudi Arabia's electricity generation and consumption have both increased manifold, forming a nationwide power grid. According to official figures from Saudi Arabia, in 1988, the total electricity generation capacity in Saudi Arabia was approximately 1.15 billion kilowatts, twelve times the national electricity generation capacity in 1975. All regions in the country have access to electricity, with a total of 2,154,000 users. In 1988, industrial electricity consumption accounted for 25.4% of the total electricity generation, five times higher than in 1975.

Saudi Arabia has the following characteristics in the development of the electric power industry:

	(1) **Large State Investment.** The government has allocated a total of 66 billion riyals (1 US dollar equals 3.75 riyals) for this purpose. In the capital and other regions, large-scale power projects have been built, with many power stations equipped with advanced technology and facilities of world-class standards.

	(2) **Combining State-Owned and Private Enterprises, Emphasizing the Role of Private Enterprises.** In terms of investment, most power companies are state-owned, but after the projects are completed, the state hands over these enterprises to private management to improve operational efficiency. At the same time, the state strongly encourages private enterprises to develop the electric power industry.

	(3) **Providing Convenience for Users.** The Saudi government stipulates that electricity will be supplied wherever industrial and mining enterprises are built and wherever residents move. The government has also decided to provide users with cheap electricity, with electricity prices lower than the cost of generation. To this end, the government provides large subsidies and loans to various power companies, totaling 28 billion riyals in various forms of assistance and subsidies, and 38 billion riyals in loans.

	(4) **Continuously Updating Power Generation Equipment.** According to the Saudi government's plan, since the implementation of the third five-year plan in 1980, various power companies have successively updated their power generation equipment. Currently, 40% of the large power generation units have been replaced with high-capacity steam power generation units. The government has also stipulated that in the future, all new power plants or power stations will be equipped with these new steam power generation units.

	(5) **Strengthening Management.** On the one hand, relevant departments are responsible for organizing efforts to popularize electricity knowledge nationwide and calling on users to save electricity; on the other hand, the Saudi Ministry of Industrial Electricity has established a professional electric power team, actively cultivating local electric power experts and technicians to manage, maintain, and supply electricity to users. The Ministry of Industrial Electricity has also built many repair and manufacturing plants nationwide to process and manufacture various components needed by electric power companies.

The Saudi government, according to the blueprint for the development of the electric power industry, will continue to make efforts on the basis of the achievements already made.

In the next ten to fifteen years, Saudi Arabia will build a unified national grid. In addition, Saudi Arabia will build a large-scale power transmission network in the eastern region, not only to improve the power supply conditions in the region but also to extend this large-scale power transmission network to Kuwait and Bahrain.

    沙特重视发展电力事业
    时延春
    沙特阿拉伯幅员辽阔，人烟稀少，城乡跨度很大。随着石油收入的不断增加，各项建设事业蓬勃发展起来。如何满足城乡居民和建设事业对用电的需求，是沙特政府面临的一项重要任务。
    沙特政府高度重视发展电力事业，经过多年的不懈努力，已取得丰硕成果。沙特的发电量和用电量都在成倍增加，已形成一个横贯全国的电力网。据沙特官方公布，一九八八年，沙特全国总发电能力约一点一五亿千瓦，为一九七五年全国发电能力的十二倍，全国各地都用上了电，用户共达二百一十五万四千户。一九八八年工业用电占总发电量的百分之二十五点四，比一九七五年增加了五倍。
    沙特在发展电力事业方面有以下几个特点：
    （一）国家投资大。政府在这方面共拨款六百六十亿里亚尔（一美元合三点七五里亚尔），在首都和其它地区都兴建了大型电力工程项目，有很多发电站技术设备先进，具有世界第一流水平。（二）国营与私营相结合，重视私营的作用。在投资方面，大部分电力公司属国营，但项目建成后，国家便将这些企业交私营管理，以提高经营效益。与此同时，国家大力鼓励私营企业发展电力事业。（三）为用户提供方便。沙特政府规定，工矿企业建在哪里，住户搬到哪里，电就送到哪里。政府还决定，向用户提供廉价电，电费低于发电成本。为此，政府向各发电公司提供巨额补贴和贷款，已向各电力公司提供各种资助和补贴二百八十亿里亚尔，提供贷款三百八十亿里亚尔。（四）不断更新发电设备。根据沙特政府的规划，自一九八零年执行第三个五年计划以来，各电力公司陆续更新发电设备。目前，百分之四十的大型发电机组已改为功率大的蒸汽发电机组。政府还规定，今后凡新建发电厂或发电站，一律装配这种新式的蒸汽发电机组。（五）加强管理。一方面，有关部门负责组织力量，在全国普及用电常识，号召用户节约用电；另一方面，沙特工业电力部建立了一支专业电力队伍，大力培养本国电力专家和技术人员，负责电力设备的管理，维修及用户的供电工作。工业电力部还在全国各地修建了许多修配厂，负责加工制造各电力公司所需的零配件。
    沙特政府按照发展电力事业的蓝图，将在已取得成就的基础上，继续做出努力。
    在今后十至十五年内，沙特将建成联结全国的统一电网。此外，沙特将在东部地区修建一个大型输电网，不仅为进一步改善该地区的供电条件服务，还将把这一大型输电网延伸到科威特和巴林。
