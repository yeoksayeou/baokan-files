The Chinese Disabled Artists' Troupe held its farewell performance at the "Expression and Gesture Theatre" in Moscow tonight, receiving a warm welcome from the audience.

The Chinese Disabled Artists' Troupe arrived in Moscow on June 26 and performed 10 shows in the Soviet capital, Rostov-on-Don, and Leningrad. Nearly 5,000 spectators enjoyed the dances, solos, instrumental solos, and sign language poetry performed by Chinese deaf-mute, blind, and physically disabled artists.

During the two-week period, the troupe won the admiration of Soviet disabled people and other spectators with its extraordinary performances. Soviet audiences expressed their friendship and affection for the Chinese disabled artists with applause, cheers, flowers, and gifts. After each performance, the audience lingered, waiting to have the performers sign autographs after they had changed out of their costumes.

A responsible official from the Soviet Ministry of Culture said after the performance: "We have never seen such wonderful performances before. Through the performances, we have seen the great potential and possibilities of disabled people." He expressed congratulations and thanks to the Chinese disabled performers on behalf of the people of Moscow.

    我残疾人艺术团访苏受欢迎
    新华社莫斯科7月9日电　（记者唐修哲）中国残疾人艺术团今晚在这里的“表情和手势剧院”举行访苏告别演出，受到观众的热烈欢迎。
    中国残疾人艺术团于6月26日抵达莫斯科，先后在苏联首都、顿河罗斯托夫和列宁格勒演出10场。近5000名观众欣赏了中国聋哑人、盲人和肢残人演出的舞蹈、独唱、器乐独奏和手语诗等精彩节目。
    两周期间，艺术团以不寻常的演出赢得了苏联残疾人和其他观众的赞赏。苏联观众用掌声、喝彩声、鲜花和礼品向中国残疾艺人表达了友谊和热爱。每场演出结束后，观众都久久不愿离去，等待着演员卸装后签名留念。
    苏联文化部的一位负责官员在演出结束后说：如此精彩的演出我们过去从未见到过，通过演出我们看到了残疾人有多么大的潜力和可能。他代表莫斯科人向中国残疾演员们表示祝贺和谢意。
