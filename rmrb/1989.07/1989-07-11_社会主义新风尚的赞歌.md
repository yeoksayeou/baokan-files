The long-form reportage "Unfinished Symphony" by Wu Deming has recently been published by Yunnan People's Publishing House. The book describes the touching story of people from Yunnan Province and across the country extending a helping hand to rescue a critically ill female high school student, vividly showcasing the pure, kind, and beautiful hearts of many ordinary people. It is a symphony of love, an ode to the new socialist ethos. At the same time, it sketches various social attitudes and human emotions surrounding this rescue effort, revealing different values, ethical views, and ways of thinking in the process of developing a commodity economy. The book also uses sharp criticism to address social issues, such as the imbalance between the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and material civilization, and certain contradictions in the relationship between officials and the masses. The author, in the face of the coexistence and confrontation of good and evil, beauty and ugliness in real life, calls out loudly: This symphony full of love is unfinished.

The work is rich in contemporary relevance, often flashing with passionate poetry, and has distinctive structural features. It borrows the composition format of a symphony, organizing the complex characters and events, and the colorful "musical images" according to a certain logical and artistic logic. Apart from the "Overture" and the "Not Quite the Finale," the entire book is divided into four "movements."

It is worth mentioning that the life materials of this work are mostly facts that the author has personally experienced and witnessed; he did not participate in the rescue activity as a writer or reporter for post-event interviews and investigations, but was himself an integral part of the rescue effort, like a note in the symphony. Therefore, the text is filled with genuine feelings and deep emotions.

    社会主义新风尚的赞歌
    洪军
    吴德铭创作的长篇报告文学《未完成的交响乐》，新近由云南人民出版社出版。书中描述了云南省乃至全国各地群众伸出友爱的手，自发援救一名病危女中学生的感人事迹，生动地展示了许多普通人纯真、善良、美好的心灵。它是一部爱的交响乐，是一曲社会主义新风尚的赞歌。同时，它围绕这场救援活动，勾画了当今社会的种种世态人情，揭示了发展商品经济过程中人们不同的价值观、伦理道德观和思维方式。本书还以犀利的笔锋针砭时弊，提出一些发人深省的社会问题，如社会主义精神文明和物质文明建设的失衡，干群关系方面出现的某些矛盾等。作者针对现实生活中大量并存对峙的善与恶、美与丑，大声疾呼：这部充满爱的旋律的交响乐是未完成的。
    该作品内容时代感强，不时闪现激越的诗情，在结构上也有特点。它借鉴交响乐曲的创作格式，将纷繁的人物事件和多色彩的“音乐形象”，按照一定的思想层次和艺术逻辑组合起来。除了“序曲”和“并非终曲的尾声”外，全书共分四个“乐章”。
    值得一提的是，这部作品的生活素材，大多是作者亲身经历和耳闻目睹的事实；他不是以作家和记者的身份去作事后的采访、调查，而自身就始终参加了这场救援活动，宛如交响乐中的一个音符。因此，字里行间流动着真切的感受和深挚的情思。
