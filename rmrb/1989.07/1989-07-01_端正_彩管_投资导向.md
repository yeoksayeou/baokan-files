China International Engineering Consulting Corporation recently provided information indicating that the "color TV boom" has triggered a "color tube boom." During the rectification and cleanup, many places are vying to start color cathode ray tube (CRT) and glass bulb projects, and the investment enthusiasm is not only not decreasing but is continuing to rise.

Projects in Qingdao, Dongguan, Changsha, and others, which have been included in the plan but not yet evaluated, are currently undergoing preliminary work. Projects outside the plan, such as the color CRT project in Foshan, Guangdong, are trying to secure approval for construction.

Under the guise of "self-sufficiency," the glass bulbs needed for Beijing's color CRTs, which could be supplied by Anyang (short-term) and Shijiazhuang (long-term), are being produced again. Anyang, which already has glass bulbs, is now proposing to produce color CRTs.

The development of this "color tube" investment boom not only does not comply with the current rectification and cleanup requirements but will also impact and disrupt the overall layout planning.

Current Situation: Rapid Development of Color TV Production and Severe Shortage of Color Tubes

In the past decade, China's color TV production has developed rapidly. In 1979, the production volume was less than 10,000 units, in 1984 it exceeded 1 million units, and in 1988 it exceeded 10 million units, far exceeding the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" target of 8 million units, with an average annual growth rate of 117%.

From 1984 to 1986, 100 color TV assembly production lines were launched nationwide. Although the Ministry of Electronics conducted technical and quality inspections and adjustments during this period, the production capacity of color TVs remained excessive. Due to the rapid development, the main component needed for assembling color TVs, the color CRT, was in severe shortage.

China's color CRT production began in 1982, with a production volume of only 580,000 units in 1983. To date, the annual production capacity is only around 2 million units, which is obviously insufficient to meet the needs of the existing color TV production lines. Last year, 10.28 million color TVs were produced, with the color CRTs mainly imported, and only 14.6% using domestically produced color CRTs.

Under normal circumstances, assembling 100 color TVs requires 104 color CRTs. By the end of the "Eighth Five-Year Plan," how many color CRTs will be needed to meet the needs of color TV production?

Forecast: By 1995, the annual demand for color CRTs will be 12 to 13 million units

By the end of 1988, China's urban and rural TV ownership had reached 135 million units, a 20% increase from the previous year's 112 million units; among them, color TV ownership was 32 million units, a 45% increase from the previous year's 22 million units. The market response was still "ticket-based purchasing, supply not meeting demand."

It is worth noting that behind the "tight supply of color TVs," there are factors of overconsumption, and the market response does not fully reflect the domestic social purchasing power. Last year, relevant authorities conducted a survey in Tianjin, which showed that among 1,000 color TV buyers, 25% had borrowed money to purchase them. At the beginning of this year, due to price increases and other factors, the sales volume of color TVs in some places dropped sharply. According to reports, in Guangdong, the last week of January saw the sale of more than 1,000 domestically produced color TVs, while the sales volume in the first half of February was only over 100 units. The Guangzhou Radio Equipment Factory, which used to produce 20,000 color TVs per month and could not meet demand, now has half the production volume, but inventory is piling up.

Relevant authorities used various methods to estimate that by 1995, urban and rural households will reach 268 million. Among them, 54 million are urban households, and 214 million are rural households. If the color TV penetration rate is calculated at 90% for urban areas and 35% for rural areas, approximately 90 million color TVs will still be needed. The domestic market demand is approximately 13 million units per year. This estimated total may still be high.

If the annual demand is at the level of 10 million units, adding the needs for export and maintenance, the actual demand for color CRTs can be estimated. That is, by 1995, the annual production capacity of color CRTs can be controlled between 12 million and 13 million units.

However, from the production capacity of color CRT projects that have been included in the preliminary planning, it has already exceeded 17 million units, far exceeding the experts' forecast of 12 million to 13 million units.

Constraints: Difficulty in Raising Funds and Limited Foreign Exchange Capacity

If all the projects outside the plan are allowed to start construction, the production capacity of color CRTs by 1995 could reach more than 20 million units. This will not only continue to expand the planned construction scale but also lead to the dispersion of the country's limited financial and material resources, seriously affecting the timely completion and operation of projects within the plan.

Investment and technology-intensive are the obvious characteristics of the color CRT industry. The China International Engineering Consulting Corporation's analysis of the color CRT projects in Beijing, Nanjing, and Shanghai shows that the investment per tube is approximately 400 to 700 yuan. If the production capacity of 10 million color CRTs is increased, at least 5 billion yuan will be needed, making it difficult to raise funds.

Foreign exchange payments are even more difficult to bear. The color CRT production lines introduced during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" and "Seventh Five-Year Plan" have product specifications of more than ten types, and the production processes and technologies are not uniform, increasing the difficulty of localization. Relying on the import of components to assemble color CRTs, each color CRT requires approximately $70 in foreign exchange. In the total color TV production last year, the use of imported color CRTs and a small number of matching components amounted to a total foreign exchange expenditure of $800 million.

The foreign exchange expenditure after the project is put into operation is also significant. After the Beijing plant is put into operation, the evaluation predicts that it will use $30 to $40 million in foreign exchange for production each year for four years; after the Shanghai plant reaches full capacity, it will use $8 to $9 million in foreign exchange for production each year. It is understood that the production of 10 million color CRTs per year requires the import of raw materials, matching components, molds, and spare parts, with a total foreign exchange expenditure of approximately $150 million.

Guidance: Shift Investment Focus to Domestic Production and Enhance New Technology Development Capabilities

The above situation shows that the current investment orientation of China's color CRT industry urgently needs to be rectified. That is, it is not advisable to continue to expand the production capacity scale, but it is urgent to reduce and strictly control the construction scale and speed of the color CRT production lines, and shift the investment focus to the domestic production of raw materials and matching components needed for color CRT production. This should be done mainly through the technical renovation and expansion of old factories, enhancing the development capabilities of new products and new technologies, so that the color CRT industry can develop in a coordinated manner towards economies of scale.

This is because the construction speed of China's color CRT production capacity is already not low; only by striving to achieve the domestic production of raw materials and matching components needed for color CRTs can we get rid of dependence on foreign countries and significantly reduce imports and save foreign exchange.

Moreover, converting black-and-white tube production lines to color tube production lines requires less money and is technically feasible. Currently, in economically developed countries, the production of black-and-white tubes accounts for only 10% to 2

    端正“彩管”投资导向
    本报记者　鲁牧
    中国国际工程咨询公司最近提供的情况表明，
  “彩电热”引发了“彩管热”。在治理、整顿中，不少地方争上彩色显像管与玻壳项目，投资热度不仅不减，相反还在继续升温。
    已列规划而尚未评估论证的青岛、东莞、长沙等“彩管”项目，正在进行前期工作；规划外的广东佛山等“彩管”项目在想方设法争取建设。
    在“自我配套”名义下，北京“彩管”所需玻壳，本可由安阳（近期）、石家庄（远期）供应，却要再上玻壳；安阳有了玻壳，又提出上“彩管”。
    这股“彩管”投资热的发展，既不符合当前治理、整顿要求，又将使宏观布点规划遭受冲击，甚至被打乱。
    现状：彩电生产发展迅速彩管供应严重短缺
    近10年，我国彩电生产发展迅速。1979年产量还不到1万台，1984年突破百万台，1988年又突破千万台大关，远远超过“七五”计划800万台指标，平均年增长率高达117％。
    1984至1986年间，全国百条电视机装配生产线先后上马。尽管当时电子工业部在技术、质量考核检查的基础上进行了调减，但电视机生产能力仍然偏大。由于发展过快，组装整机所需的主要部件彩色显像管严重短缺。
    我国“彩管”生产是从1982年开始的，1983年产量只有58万只。到目前为止，年生产能力也不过200多万只，显然不能满足现有彩电生产线的装机需要。去年生产1028万台彩电，所需“彩管”主要依靠进口，采用国产“彩管”的仅占14.6％。
    在通常情况下，组装100台彩电，需要“彩管”104只。到“八五”期末需要多少“彩管”才能适应彩电生产的需要？
    预测：到1995年，“彩管”年需求量1200万至1300万只
    1988年底，我国城乡电视机拥有量已达1.35亿台，比上年1.12亿台增长20％；其中，彩电拥有量为3200万台，比上年2200万台增长45％。市场反映仍为“凭票购买，供不应求”。
    值得注意的是，在“彩电供应紧俏”背后，隐藏着超前消费的因素，市场反映并不完全真实体现国内社会购买力水平。去年，有关方面在天津调查的结果表明，在1000台彩电买主中，有25％是借钱购置的。今年初，由于价格上涨和其他因素，有的地方彩电销售量急剧下降。据报载，广东1月份最后一周国产彩电售出1000多台，而2月上半月销售量仅为100多台。广州广播设备厂过去每月生产2万台彩电供不应求，如今产量减少一半，库存却大量积压。
    有关方面采用多种方法测算，到1995年，城乡居民将达2.68亿户。其中，城市0.54亿户，农村2.14亿户。如按彩电普及率城市为90％、农村为35％计算，尚需彩电9000万台左右。国内市场需求量每年约1300万台。这个预测总量可能还是偏高的。
    若按年需求量1000万台水平，加上出口和维修需要可以推算出对“彩管”的实际需要。即：到1995年“彩管”年生产能力可控制在1200万至1300万只之间。
    但是，从各地纳入初步规划建设的“彩管”项目生产能力来看，已经不下1700多万只，大大超越了专家们预测的1200万至1300万只的水平线。
    制约：资金筹措难度大外汇承受能力差
    如果一路绿灯，使规划外的“彩管”项目一一动工兴建，那末到1995年“彩管”生产能力有可能达到2000万只以上。这不仅会使规划建设规模继续膨胀，而且导致国家有限财力物力分散使用，严重影响规划内项目如期竣工投产。
    投资、技术双密集型是“彩管”产业的明显特点。中国国际工程咨询公司对京、宁、沪3个“彩管”项目进行分析结果，单管投资额约为400至700元。如果新增1000万只“彩管”的生产能力，至少需要投资50多亿元，资金筹措难度甚大。
    外汇支付更难以承受。“六五”、“七五”引进的
  “彩管”生产线，产品规格多达十几种，生产工艺技术不一，增加了国产化难度。而依靠进口散件组装“彩管”，每只“彩管”用汇约需70美元。在去年生产的彩电总量中，采用进口“彩管”以及少量配套件，总用汇额达8亿美元之巨。
    项目投产后的用汇量也不小。北京厂投产后，评估预测4年间每年生产用汇三四千万美元；上海厂达产后，每年生产用汇也要八九百万美元。据了解，年产1000万只“彩管”，所需进口原材料、配套件、工模具和备品备件，总用汇额约为1.5亿美元。
    导向：投资重点移到国产化增强新技术开发实力
    上述概况显示，当前我国“彩管”投资导向亟待端正。也就是说，不宜继续扩大生产能力规模，而是迫切需要调减和严控“彩管”生产线的建设规模和速度，将投资重点移到生产“彩管”所需的原料材料、配套件的国产化工程上来。并以老厂技术改造、扩大生产为主，增强新产品、新技术开发实力，以使“彩管”产业得以协调地向规模经济发展。
    这是因为，我国“彩管”生产能力建设速度已经不低；只有努力实现“彩管”所需的原材料、配套件的国产化，才能摆脱对国外的依赖，大幅地减少进口、节省外汇。
    还因为，将黑白管生产线改为彩色管生产线，花钱不多，技术易行。目前，经济发达国家黑白管产量仅为彩管产量的10％—20％，而我国现有黑白管年生产能力比彩色管产量高出五六倍。有计划地实行部分老厂技术改造，可使现有黑白管生产线得到充分利用，节省大量投资。
    再说，我国已经引进的“彩管”生产线均属80年代初、中期水平，缺乏新品开发技术手段。当今国际上正以“提高彩色电视图像质量”为目标，大力开发彩电新技术。有的国家已经完成了“高清晰度电视”的一系列完整技术和设备研制，将作为“第三代电视”问世。我们如不及早考虑安排新产品、新技术开发，比如建立一两个研究开发中心，那末若干年后很有可能使一大批“彩管”生产线再度依靠引进来进行技术改造。
