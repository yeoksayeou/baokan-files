Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 1st.

A new bridge, the Duoqiu Bridge, is currently under construction on the Yarlung Zangbo River, the highest river in the world. This is the twelfth large bridge to be built on this river since 1965. Before 1965, there were no road bridges across the Yarlung Zangbo River, and only a few simple wooden bridges were built over some of its tributaries. People and livestock had to rely on ferries, rafts, small wooden boats, or zip lines to cross the river.

The Duoqiu Bridge, currently under construction, is located at the junction of Nimu County and Renbu County in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River. It is 207 meters long.

    雅鲁藏布江又架一座新桥
    据新华社拉萨七月一日电　（记者柴怀吉）在世界海拔最高的河流雅鲁藏布江上，最近又动工兴建一座新桥——妥峡大桥。这是自一九六五年以来这条大河上出现的第十二座大型桥梁。一九六五年以前，雅鲁藏布江上没有一座公路桥梁，只在个别支流上有简易木桥，行人和牛马全靠摆渡牛皮筏、小木船或溜索。正在动工兴建中的妥峡大桥，位于雅鲁藏布江中游的尼木县和仁布县交界处，全长二百零七米。
