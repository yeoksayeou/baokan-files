I will never see Old Sun again.

Old Sun was originally a janitor for the office building. Even after retirement, he still came to the factory every day to eat and take a shower. He lived alone with no family, so he resided in the single-person dormitory across from the factory, truly making the factory his home.

Every time he saw me, Old Sun would always show a happy expression. From far away, he would raise his hand above his head and wave. As he got closer, he would greet me warmly and then encourage me, "Little Zhao, good comrade, good youth." His words and actions had the air of a leader. I thus often received inexplicable praise. After a while, I became accustomed to it, vaguely feeling that I was indeed "good."

The cold north wind began to blow, and Old Sun's asthma flared up again. This time it was serious, and he was hospitalized. Suddenly, everyone in the building remembered his past kindnesses and discussed sending a representative to visit him. Thinking of the many times I had received verbal praise, I volunteered eagerly, even to the point where my colleagues were secretly puzzled.

Old Sun was indeed very ill, looking emaciated. In his own words, "I've become a shriveled date." This was vivid; his face had once been ruddy, plump, and shiny, like a fresh, ripe date turning red, but now it had changed.

The visiting representatives thought of various things to say to comfort him, each person taking a turn, but the words seemed ineffective. Old Sun listened intently and nodded, but he spoke very little. The "representatives" were about to leave, and he silently shook hands with each person, as if saying goodbye. Everyone's hearts suddenly felt heavy.

Finally, it was my turn. Old Sun tightly gripped my hand and spoke with difficulty, "Little Zhao, I really want to thank you. Those two red towels, I've been using them all along. I thank you." Old Sun looked up at me, and his eyes were filled with tears.

Red towels?

"You've forgotten? How could you forget? They were those discounted towels, the cheap ones. A very large one with a hole in the middle, I cut it into two, one large and one small. You helped me hem the edges. Just then, your sewing machine was broken, so you sewed them by hand, stitch by stitch." Old Sun struggled to help me remember.

I finally recalled it. I suddenly realized, and then felt ashamed.

That was already two years ago. A discounted towel with a hole in it, which Old Sun had cut into two, and I had helped hem the edges. To me, it was just a small favor. I remember at the time I had even secretly laughed at Old Sun for being too frugal, thinking it was nothing much. I never imagined that he had been using those two red towels all this time, nor that he had kept this trivial matter—perhaps the only thing I had done for him—in his heart until today, until his death. That night, he quietly left the world, unable to catch his breath.

The next morning, the sun was shining brightly. In the spacious hallway of the office building, I heard the news of Old Sun's passing. I couldn't help but shed tears. I accepted his thanks, but I didn't have the chance to do something good for him, truly do something good. I regret it so much! Doing a good deed is not difficult, but why do we become increasingly lazy about doing good deeds?

    红毛巾
    赵每
    再也见不到老孙了。
    老孙原是清扫办公楼的勤杂工。退休以后，还天天来厂吃饭、洗澡。他孤身一人没有家，就住在工厂对面的单身宿舍里，真是以厂为家了。
    每次见到我，老孙总露出高兴的神色，老远就把手举过头挥着，走近了，亲切地问候，然后就是鼓励：“小赵，好同志，好青年。”言行颇具首长的风度。我于是常常莫名其妙地受到表扬。次数一多，便也心安理得，恍惚自己真是“好”了。
    寒冷的北风吹起来，老孙哮喘又发了。这回挺危险，住进了医院。大楼里的人一下子都想起他往日的种种好处来，商量着推派代表去探望他。想到多次受到的口头表扬，我自告奋勇，积极争取，以至同事们暗暗纳闷。
    老孙确实病得厉害，形容憔悴，用他自己的话说，“成了一颗干瘪枣子”。这很形象，他的脸膛曾是红润饱满亮光光的，像一只由青刚转红的新鲜大枣，现在变了。
    探病代表想出种种话来安慰他，你一句我一句，说的人自己也觉得无效。老孙喘着粗气认真地听，认真地点头，却很少说话。“代表们”要走了，他默默地与每个人握手，俨然是告别。大家心里忽然都很难过。
    最后轮到我。老孙紧紧地握住我的手，吃力地说了话：“小赵，我真要谢谢你呢。那两条红毛巾，我一直在用。我谢谢你。”老孙仰脸望着我，眼里竟然含着泪。
    红毛巾？
    “你忘了？你怎么忘了？就是那条处理品，我买的便宜货。很大的一条，中间有个洞，我一剪为两，一条大，一条小，是你帮我缝的边。刚巧你家缝纫机坏了，你是用手一针一针缝的。”老孙使劲地帮我回忆。
    我终于想起来了。我恍然大悟，继而羞愧难言。
    那已经是两年前的事了。一条有洞的处理品毛巾，被老孙剪成了两条，是我帮助缝的边。那在我不过是举手之劳。记得当时我还曾暗笑老孙过于精打细算，颇不以为然。没想到那两条红毛巾他一直在用，更没想到他把这区区小事——也许是我为他做的唯一的事——一直记在心里，直到今天，直至去世。那天深夜，一口气没接上，老孙悄悄地离开了人世。
    第二天早晨阳光灿烂。在办公楼宽敞的走廊上，我听到了老孙去世的消息。我忍不住流下了眼泪。我接受了他的感谢，却来不及去为他做一点好事了，真正地去做一点好事。我多么后悔！一个人做点好事并不难，可是为什么我们越来越懒得去做好事了呢？
    红毛巾！我想我永远不会忘记那两条红毛巾了，一条大，一条小。
