Khieu Samphan, Deputy Chairman of the Democratic Kampuchea, stated this morning in Paris that the success of the upcoming international conference on the Cambodian issue will entirely depend on whether Vietnam changes its rigid stance.

Khieu Samphan, who came to Paris to attend the international conference, told reporters in his hotel: Vietnam has consistently opposed the five-point plan proposed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, representing the three resistance forces, for a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue. Its aim is to maintain the continued existence of the Phnom Penh regime, which it has supported, and to prolong its occupation of Cambodia.

Khieu Samphan pointed out that Hanoi's refusal to seek a comprehensive solution to the Cambodian issue and its division of the issue into "international" and "domestic" parts will inevitably lead the resolution of the Cambodian issue into a dead end.

He said, the international conference on the Cambodian issue is significant because many major countries are participating. It will exert greater pressure on Vietnam and push for a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable resolution to the Cambodian issue.

Emphasizing the role of the United Nations in resolving the Cambodian issue, Khieu Samphan said: "Vietnam must withdraw all its troops under international supervision, and the United Nations is the most appropriate organization to monitor Vietnam's withdrawal."

He added: The Phnom Penh regime, which was set up by the Vietnamese invaders, should be dissolved. "However, to express our desire for a resolution to the Cambodian issue, we are even willing to establish a four-party joint government, including the Phnom Penh regime, to achieve national reconciliation."

Khieu Samphan made these remarks during a meeting with more than 10 reporters from China, Thailand, France, West Germany, and other countries.

    乔森潘谈柬埔寨问题国际会议
    会议成败取决越南立场
    新华社巴黎7月29日电　（记者杨木、沈孝泉）民柬副主席乔森潘今天上午在巴黎指出，即将举行的柬埔寨问题国际会议能否获得积极成果，将完全取决于越南是否改变其顽固立场。
    前来参加巴黎国际会议的乔森潘在他下榻的旅馆里对记者说：越南一直反对由西哈努克亲王代表抵抗力量三方所阐述的关于全面解决柬埔寨问题的五点计划，其目的在于维护由它扶植起来的金边政权的继续存在，并长期占领柬埔寨。
    乔森潘指出，河内拒绝柬埔寨问题的全面解决而把这个问题分为“国际部分”和“国内部分”，这必将使柬埔寨问题的解决走进死胡同。
    他说，柬埔寨问题国际会议有重要意义，因为有许多有关的大国参加。它将会对越南施加更大的压力，推动柬埔寨问题得到全面、公正、合理的解决。
    乔森潘在强调联合国在解决柬埔寨问题中的作用时说：“越南必须在国际监督下全部撤军，而联合国是对越南撤军实施监督最合适的机构。”
    他说：由越南侵略者扶植起来的金边政权应当予以解散。“但是，为了表达寻求柬埔寨问题的愿望，我们甚至同意建立包括金边政权在内的四方联合政府，以实现民族和解。”
    乔森潘是在同来自中国、泰国、法国、西德等国的10多位记者会见时发表上述看法的。
