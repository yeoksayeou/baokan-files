Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, July 23rd.

According to reports from Jerusalem, approximately one million Israeli workers began a two-hour strike at 11 AM today to protest the severe unemployment trend in Israel.

This is the most serious strike in Israel in the past two years. Participants included civil servants, bank employees, airport staff, and workers. The strike caused hundreds of banks and government departments to cease operations and offices to close, and Ben Gurion Airport was temporarily in chaos. More than 2,000 workers gathered around the Prime Minister's Office, hoping that the cabinet would propose new measures to expand employment opportunities.

Israel currently has 140,000 unemployed workers.
