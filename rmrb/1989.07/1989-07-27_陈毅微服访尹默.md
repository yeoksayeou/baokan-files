Chen Yi in Disguise Visits Yin Mo

In May 1949, Shanghai was liberated, and Chen Yi took office as the first mayor of Shanghai. Amidst his busy schedule, he often visited alleys and met with scholars to understand public opinion. In mid-June of that year, Mayor Chen, dressed in plain clothes and accompanied by Military Commissioner Li Yanan, visited the famous scholar Shen Yinmo in Hongkou, Shanghai. That year, Mr. Shen was 67 years old and lived in a wooden structure on the second floor of a building. That morning, Mr. Shen was in his study writing poetry. Upon learning of the mayor's visit, he quickly put on a French hat, wiped his 2000-degree glasses, and descended the old-style staircase to greet the guests. However, Chen Yi had already ascended to the second floor. Mr. Shen and the two old friends were overjoyed, shaking hands and laughing with wrinkles spreading across their faces. His wife also hurried over to welcome the distinguished guest into the "Qiuming Study." After exchanging greetings, Chen Yi, speaking in his Sichuan accent, discussed the current situation in Shanghai and praised the intellectuals who remained in Shanghai. He said frankly, "You are reliable friends of the Communist Party. The Communist Party welcomes you and needs your help for the revolutionary cause." He added, "Shanghai has just been liberated, and the masses are not yet clear about the policies, which is inevitable. You can go to Beijing to see for yourselves and then help Shanghai with some propaganda upon your return." Mr. Shen nodded in agreement, looking very pleased. Mr. Shen had previously praised the liberation of Shanghai with the lines, "Autumn hair unharmed, taking the city; Big guns proudly silent; Dawn awakens the residents, Red Army stays till daybreak." At this point, Li Yanan said, "Comrade Chen Yi is visiting Shanghai intellectuals, and you, Mr. Shen, are the first." Mr. Shen happily expressed his thanks. Chen Yi then asked Mr. Shen, "Where is Mr. Li Shizeng (former president of Sino-French University)? You are old friends; can you invite him back to discuss important matters? I, Chen Yi, have no reservations in Shanghai; I am his student after all!" Mr. Yinmo smiled and said, "Good, good! He might be in France. I will write a letter to convey your message." The general was full of laughter and enthusiasm, and as they parted, he frequently turned back to wave goodbye.

    陈毅微服访尹默
    江东
    1949年5月上海解放，陈毅出任第一任上海市长，他在日理万机之余，还深入里弄，访问贤达，探求民意。就在这年6月中旬，陈市长便装简从，由军政委李亚农陪同到上海虹口私访著名学者沈尹默。那年，沈先生已67岁，住在一座木结构的楼房的楼上。那天上午，先生正在书房作诗，得知市长驾访，即匆匆戴上法兰西帽，擦了擦2000度的眼镜，摸着老式楼梯，正要下楼迎接，哪知陈毅已昂首健步登上二楼。先生与两位故友重逢，高兴得双手握上前去，脸上笑起道道鱼鳞纹，其夫人也赶上前一起将贵宾迎入“秋明书室”。四人互作问候后，陈毅操着川音畅谈了上海现况，赞扬留在上海的知识分子。他爽朗地说：“你们是共产党的可靠朋友，共产党欢迎你们，还要借重你们，为革命大业共同工作。”他又说：“上海刚解放，群众对政策还不清楚，这是难免的。你们可以到北京去看看，回来可帮上海作些宣传。”沈先生听了连连点头，显得十分愉快。先生赞扬上海解放，早有“秋毫无犯取名城，大炮昂然未许鸣；晓起居民始惊动，红军街宿到天明。”之句。这时，李亚农接着说：“陈毅同志访问上海知识分子，您沈先生是第一人。”先生高兴地表示感谢。陈毅又向沈先生问道：“李石曾先生（前中法大学校长）现在哪里？你们是老朋友，能否请他回国共商大事。我陈毅在上海就不用顾虑，我是他的学生呀！”尹默先生笑道：“好，好！他可能在法国，我就写信去，转达您的意思。”将军谈笑风生，热情溢于言表，临别时，犹频频回首致意。
