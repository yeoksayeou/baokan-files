The Zhengzhou Paper Mill, with an annual profit of just over 100 million yuan, had a secret fund of over 100 million yuan. After half a year of investigation, the Zhengzhou Zhongyuan District Procuratorate overcame interference and uncovered the criminal fact of tax evasion amounting to 64 million yuan. Recently, the mill director, Liu Xinmin, was arrested.

According to the investigation by the Zhengzhou Zhongyuan District Procuratorate, since 1984, under the direction of the mill director Liu Xinmin, the Zhengzhou Paper Mill used methods such as falsifying employee lists, altering fake material requisition forms, not recording income, and concealing construction projects to embezzle profits, inflate costs, and divert 127 million yuan into the mill's secret fund. This money was then distributed among 11 departments to evade scrutiny, resulting in the evasion of 64 million yuan in taxes and the non-payment of 27.9 million yuan in taxes. With this secret fund, Director Liu Xinmin could freely distribute money. Over four years, he arbitrarily awarded bonuses totaling over 30 million yuan, spent 16 million yuan on banquets and gifts, and spent 17 million yuan alone on the mill's anniversary celebration last year. By the time the procuratorate investigated, the 127 million yuan in the secret fund had been almost entirely spent. The secret fund was distributed among various departments, providing opportunities for some officials to embezzle. For example, Wu Chengbin from the director's office used the secret fund he managed to divide 35 million yuan into 98 fixed-term deposit certificates, depositing them in 8 savings institutions under personal names, and embezzled over 8,000 yuan in interest.

The facts of tax evasion by the Zhengzhou Paper Mill are clear and conclusive, but during the investigation, significant interference and obstacles were encountered. Since the procuratorate filed the case, numerous people have come to intercede, totaling 97 instances so far.

The leadership of the Zhongyuan District Procuratorate stated: "We had to use more than half of our efforts to resist interference and overcome obstacles."

    郑州纸厂偷漏税款私立小金库
    检察机关依法查办力排说情风
    本报郑州7月1日电　本报记者李而亮、郑州晚报记者史家民报道：年利润不过100多万元的郑州市造纸厂，却有一个百万多元的小金库。郑州市中原区检察院经过半年多努力，排除干扰终于查清了这个小金库中偷税64万元的犯罪事实。日前厂长刘新民被逮捕。
    据郑州市中原区检察院调查：郑州市造纸厂自1984年以来，在厂长刘新民的支使下，采取虚列在册职工名单，填改假领料单和收入不入帐以及瞒报土建工程等手段，截留利润，扩大成本，将获取的127万元巨款挪入厂内小金库，并把这些钱存放在11个科室中，逃避检查，从中偷税64万元，漏税27.9万元。有了这个小金库，厂长刘新民便可随意支付。四年来，滥发奖金30多万元，请客送礼花去16万元，去年光是厂庆就花去17万元。检察机关调查时，127万元的小金库花得已所剩无几。小金库分散各科室保管，给一些干部从中贪污提供了方便。如厂长办公室武承斌利用他保管的小金库，将35万元分为98个定期存款单，以个人名义分别存入8个储蓄所，从中贪污利息8000余元。
    郑州市造纸厂偷税的事实证据确凿，性质清楚，可在查处过程中，却遇到很大的干扰和阻力。自检察院立案后，说情者便纷至沓来，到目前为止已达97人次。
    中原区检察院领导说：“我们不得不以一半以上的精力来抗干扰、排阻力。”
