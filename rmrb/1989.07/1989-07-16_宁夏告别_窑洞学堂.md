Recently, several hundred Hui ethnic minority students in Pengyang County, located in the southern part of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, have bid farewell to the narrow and dim cave schoolhouses and moved into spacious and bright classrooms made of brick and wood with glass doors and windows. Thus, Ningxia has bid farewell to the era of cave schoolhouses.

Cave schoolhouses have a history of several hundred years in Ningxia. In the 1950s, there were thousands of such schoolhouses, most of which were located in remote mountainous villages. A single cave could only accommodate one desk, and the further inside the cave, the darker it became. Often, while the sun was shining brightly outside, students had to read by lamplight inside. After liberation, with the help of the state, most students gradually moved out of the caves. However, the cave classrooms in remote mountainous areas have persisted until now. Last year, the regional government and people of all ethnic groups invested 38 million yuan, turning over 400 cave classrooms into history.

    宁夏告别“窑洞学堂”
    新华社银川七月十六日电　（记者秦凤桐）近日，宁夏回族自治区南端的彭阳县孟塬、草庙等乡村的数百名回族小学生，纷纷告别狭窄、灰暗的黄土窑洞课堂，搬进了宽敞明亮的砖木结构、玻璃门窗教室。自此，宁夏结束了窑洞学堂的历史。
    窑洞学堂，在宁夏已有数百年历史，五十年代统计有千孔之多，大部分分布在山大沟深的乡村。一孔窑洞横向只能摆一张课桌，愈往窑里，光线愈暗，常常是窑外红日当空，窑里点灯看书。解放后，在国家大力帮助下，大部分学生相继迁出了窑洞，但偏僻山乡的窑洞教室一直延续到现在。去年，区政府和各族干部群众投资三千八百多万元，使四百多孔窑洞教室成为历史。
