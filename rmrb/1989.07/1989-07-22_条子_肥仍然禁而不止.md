In early June, reporters visited the Zijiang Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory in Lengshuijiang City, Hunan Province. Workers at the factory told reporters that despite the implementation of the specialized management of chemical fertilizers this year, the practice of obtaining "ticket" fertilizer through backdoor connections remains rampant.

The Zijiang Nitrogen Fertilizer Factory is one of the largest nitrogen fertilizer producers in Hunan. In previous years, numerous requests for urea purchases came from various channels. Even after the implementation of specialized management this year, the situation with "ticket" fertilizer has not significantly improved. According to reports, the factory received over 900 requests for urea outside the specialized management plan from January to May this year. The quantities requested varied, with some as little as 50 or 100 kilograms and others as much as several dozen tons or over 100 tons. From January to April, the factory sold over 600 tons of urea through these "tickets." Most of the requesters were leaders or influential figures from departments and units related to the factory's business, work, or daily life, such as commerce, banking, taxation, public security, railways, grain, propaganda, united front, energy, food supply stations, and subsidiary food supply stores, as well as power plants. The factory leadership told reporters that while few leaders or leading cadres from administrative organs now write requests for fertilizer, many office staff do. These individuals are seen as "deities" within their units, and it is difficult to offend them. For example, if you offend someone from the railway department, you will immediately face problems with loading, unloading, and dispatching, which will affect production and cause the enterprise to suffer losses. Therefore, the factory established a special committee to review "ticket" fertilizer requests, consuming a significant amount of the leadership's energy.

The factory leadership told reporters that workers have strong opinions about the "ticket" fertilizer issue. They say that these "ticket" fertilizers promote favoritism, damaging party-group relations and leader-group relations. Those with power can obtain fertilizer, while ordinary farmers without connections cannot, which is bound to cause resentment. Secondly, it is detrimental to the rectification of the economic order. After these "ticket" fertilizers leave the factory, they go through multiple hands. Who can guarantee that they won't be resold illegally for profit? Currently, workers are demanding that the factory publicly post information about "ticket" fertilizers. However, the factory leadership dare not do so, as it would offend many "deities." This issue leaves us, as factory leaders, in a difficult position.

The factory leadership appeals to society at large to truly understand the necessity and importance of the specialized management of chemical fertilizers, to strictly adhere to relevant regulations, and to also understand their difficulties as factory leaders. They hope that people will stop writing requests for fertilizer.

    “条子”肥仍然禁而不止
    6月上旬，记者到湖南省冷水江市的资江氮肥厂采访。该厂职工向记者反映：今年化肥实行专营后，走“后门”的“条子”肥仍然禁而不止。
    资江氮肥厂是湖南有数的几个大氮肥厂之一。前两年，从各种渠道来的购买尿素的条子数不胜数。今年化肥实行专营后，该厂“条子”肥状况没有明显的改变。据了解，该厂今年1至5月份接到专营计划外的要尿素的条子多达900多张。这些条子要尿素的数量不等，少的50公斤、100公斤，多的达数十吨、100多吨。今年1至4月该厂销“条子”尿素600多吨。写条子的，大多是与企业业务、工作、生活有联系的领导机关、部门或单位的领导干部或有实权的办事人员，如工商、银行、税务、公安、铁路、粮食、宣传、统战、能源等部门和食品站、副食品供应店、电厂等单位。该厂领导告诉记者，现在，有些领导机关，领导干部写条子来要化肥的很少，甚至没有，倒是一些办事人员写的条子多，他们是这些单位的“菩萨”，实在得罪不起。如铁路部门，你只要得罪了他，装车、卸车、发车的麻烦马上就会来，生产马上受影响，企业就要吃亏。为此，该厂成立了一个专门审批“条子”肥的小组，耗去厂领导不少精力。
    该厂领导告诉记者，厂里的工人们对“条子”肥问题很有意见，说，这些“条子”肥，一是搞特殊化，影响党群关系、干群关系，手中有权的人就能搞到化肥，无背景、无关系的农民搞不到肥，怎么会没有意见？二是不利于整顿经济秩序。这些条子肥出厂后，几经辗转，这中间，谁能保证不会有人将
  “条子”肥倒卖，非法牟利？现在，工人们要求张榜公布“条子”肥。我们厂领导不敢公布，一公布就要得罪不少“菩萨”。这件事，叫我们当厂领导的左右为难。
    该厂领导呼吁，社会各界要真正认识当前化肥实行专营的必要性、重要性，严格遵守专营的有关规定，也充分理解他们当厂领导的难处，不要再写条子来要化肥了。
