The prospects for comprehensive utilization of wood are broad

Summary: The comprehensive utilization of wood is thriving in our country. It aims to save resources and improve efficiency, including the reuse of waste wood, wood substitutes, and multiple uses of wood, among others. It can be used in various ways. Recently, the National Wood Utilization Exchange and Trade Fair held in Suzhou showcased new technologies and products in wood processing and utilization in our country over the past few years. The facts show that the comprehensive utilization of wood has a broad development prospect.

Forestry is a weak link in our national economy. As an industry, it is responsible for the important task of providing wood for economic construction. However, due to resource scarcity, the supply of wood is seriously insufficient. According to statistics, the current per capita wood consumption in our country is only 0.05 cubic meters, equivalent to 1/30 of the Soviet Union, 1/35 of the United States, and 1/20 of Japan. With the development of economic construction, by the year 2000, our country's demand for wood will reach 267 million cubic meters, while the maximum production can only reach 211 million cubic meters, with a shortfall of 56 million cubic meters. This indicates that the severe shortage of wood will constrain economic development, which is a very worrying problem.

Forest resources cannot increase significantly in a short period. So, how to solve the supply-demand contradiction? There are three methods: First, excessive logging, which will lead to ecological imbalance and is not feasible; second, increasing imports, which requires a large amount of foreign exchange and is also not feasible under the current conditions; third, developing wood substitutes and comprehensive utilization, achieving multiple uses of wood, which is an important way to solve the supply-demand contradiction of wood.

In fact, our country has placed the comprehensive utilization of wood in a very important position, listing it as a key development and support project, and has achieved initial results. From the National Wood Utilization Exchange and Trade Fair in Suzhou, it can be seen that the comprehensive utilization of wood has been thriving in various places.

The organizers of the exchange told the reporter that at present, the annual production of three types of boards (plywood, fiberboard, and particleboard) in our country has reached more than 28 million cubic meters. Except for plywood, fiberboard and particleboard produced from the remaining materials and waste from wood logging and processing have an annual production of 20 million cubic meters. Calculating by 2.5 cubic meters of resources to produce one cubic meter of raw wood, and 1 cubic meter of raw wood to produce 70% of board materials, the two types of waste products, fiberboard and particleboard, can save 7 million cubic meters of forest resources. In addition, our country has mastered dozens of new wood waste processing technologies.

The key to the comprehensive utilization of wood lies in precision processing. Providing high-quality and excellent technical equipment is the foundation for the development of the comprehensive utilization of wood. The forestry machinery industry, which was once obscure, has found its place to play to the fullest, adapting to the needs of the situation, and has become the vanguard of the comprehensive utilization and processing of wood. Forestry machinery factories in Changzhou, Suzhou, and Zhenjiang, as well as the Shanghai Artificial Board Equipment Factory and the Xinxiang Woodworking Machinery Factory, have provided a large number of new technologies and equipment for the comprehensive utilization of wood in recent years, becoming one of the fastest-growing industries.

The Suzhou Forestry Machinery Factory is a manufacturer that provides large-scale equipment for plywood production, producing more than 120 dryers annually, accounting for 1/3 of the national production. They achieve the production of one generation and the research and development of the next generation. Last year, they also developed and produced bamboo plywood equipment. Using new technology to produce bamboo plywood, the material is harder than wood plywood, and the product cost is lower. Many factories have placed orders for it. The Nanjing Automobile Manufacturing Factory and the Second Automobile Works both use this type of plywood for car floor panels.

The application of new technologies has put a large number of discarded bamboo and wood materials to good use. At this exchange, we saw not only various types of particleboard, fiberboard, and decorative board, but also various wood substitutes. Using cotton stalks, corn stalks, hemp stalks, reeds, rice husks, mulberry branches, and bamboo as raw materials, and processing them into board materials, they can also replace wood and the effect is not bad.

In the past, fiberboard was used to make furniture, but it could only be used on the back of the furniture and was called a "material that cannot be seen." The Guangzhou Yuzhu Wood Factory has developed a stainless steel relief plate technology, which can carve various patterns on the fiberboard according to the user's needs. After such processing, the black appearance of the fiberboard is changed, and it is grand and beautiful when used as a decorative material.

Our country has 50 million mu of bamboo forest, with a total weight of 70 million tons. The development of bamboo instead of wood has a promising future. Chuanxian County in Sichuan Province has developed two new types of artificial boards using miscellaneous bamboo and corn stalks as raw materials, which can be widely used in building materials, furniture, packaging, and the decoration of trains and ships, and are not inferior to wood boards. A small factory producing 2,000 cubic meters of this type of artificial board annually can save 7,200 cubic meters of raw wood. If there are 300 such factories nationwide, 600,000 cubic meters of board materials can be produced annually, saving 2.16 million cubic meters of raw wood.

The comprehensive utilization of wood in our country is just starting and needs to be developed in breadth and depth. To meet the needs of development, relevant departments have initiated and organized the establishment of the National Wood Utilization Information Horizontal Cooperation Network. This cross-regional, cross-industry, and cross-departmental organization is oriented towards production, widely exchanges information, carries out technical consultations, and promotes and improves the economic and social benefits of the comprehensive utilization of wood.

    我国林业资源严重不足，供需矛盾突出，怎么办？
    发展木材综合利用前景广阔
    本报记者　高保生
    提要：木材综合利用正在我国蓬勃发展。它以节约资源和提高效益为目的，包括废木利用、木材代用、一木多用等等，可以做出多样文章。不久前在苏州举办的全国木材综合利用交流交易会，展示了我国近年来木材加工利用的新技术和新产品。事实说明，木材综合利用有着广阔的发展前景。
    林业，是我国国民经济的一个薄弱环节。作为一项产业，它担负着为经济建设提供木材的重要任务。然而，由于资源紧缺，导致木材供应严重不足。据统计，目前我国木材的人均消费量仅为0.05立方米，仅相当于苏联的1／30，美国的1／35，日本的1／20。随着经济建设的发展，到2000年，我国木材需要量将达2.67亿立方米，而产量最多只能达到2.11亿立方米，有5600万立方米的缺口。这说明，木材的严重不足将制约经济的发展，是一个令人十分担忧的问题。
    林木资源短时间内不可能有较大增长，那么，怎样解决供需矛盾呢？有三个办法：一是过量采伐，这将以破坏生态平衡为代价，实不可取；二是扩大进口，这要花大量外汇，限于条件，也不足取；第三靠发展木材代用和综合利用，实现一木多用，这是解决木材供需矛盾的一个重要出路。
    事实上，我国已经把木材综合利用放到十分重要的位置，列为重点开发和扶植项目，取得初步的成果。从苏州木材综合利用交流交易会上可以看到，木材综合利用已经在各地蓬勃发展起来。
    交流会主办者告诉记者，目前我国三板（胶合板、纤维板、刨花板）的年产量已达280多万立方米，除胶合板外，利用木材采伐和加工的剩余物和废弃物而生产的纤维板和刨花板，年产达200万立方米。按2.5立方米资源出一方原木，1立方米原木出70％板材计算，仅纤维板和刨花板两种利废产品，就可节约森林资源700多万立方米。除此之外，我国还掌握了数十种木材利废加工新技术。
    木材综合利用，贵在精加工。提供优质精良的技术设备，是发展木材综合利用的基础。过去一直默默无闻的林业机械行业，适应形势需要，有了用武之地，成了木材综合利用和加工的先锋。常州、苏州、镇江等地的林业机械厂，以及上海人造板设备厂，新乡木工机械厂，近年为木材综合利用提供了大量新的技术和设备，成为发展较快的工业行业。
    苏州林业机械厂是为胶合板生产提供大型设备的厂家，年产120多台干燥机，占全国产量的1／3。他们做到生产一代，研制一代，去年又开发生产了以竹代木胶合板设备。用新技术生产竹胶合板，比木制胶合板质地更坚硬，产品成本低，不少厂家纷纷订购。南京汽车制造厂和二汽都采用了这种胶合板做为车厢地板。
    新技术的应用，使被废弃的大批竹木料派上了用场。在这次交流会上，我们看到不仅有各式各样的刨花板、纤维板、装饰板，还有各种木材代用品，利用棉秆、玉米秆、麻秆、芦苇、稻壳、桑条、毛竹等农副产品秆茎及植物纤维加工成板材，也可代替木材使用，并且效果不差。
    过去用纤维板做家具，只能用在家具的背面，被称为“见不得人的材料”。广州鱼珠木材厂研制出一种浮雕不锈钢板技术，可根据用户需要，在纤维板上刻制出各种花纹。这样一处理，改变了纤维板黑黝黝的面孔，做装饰材料，大方美观。
    我国有5000万亩竹林面积，总重量达7000万吨。发展以竹代木，前景诱人。四川省开县研制出利用杂竹和玉米秆为原料的两种新型人造板，可广泛应用于建材、家具、包装及火车、轮船装修，比木制板一点也不逊色。一个年产2000立方米的这种人造板小厂，每年可节约原木7200立方米。如全国发展300个这样的厂家，每年则可生产板材60万立方米，节约原木216万立方米。
    木材综合利用在我国还刚刚起步，有待向广度和深度发展。为适应发展的需要，有关部门发起并组织成立了全国木材综合利用情报横向联合网络。这个跨地区、跨行业、跨部门的联合组织，面向生产，广泛交流信息，开展技术咨询，促进和提高木材综合利用的经济效益和社会效益。
