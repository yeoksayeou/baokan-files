Colombia's Barco government cabinet has undergone changes, with 13 ministers submitting their resignations to allow President Barco to reorganize the cabinet. This was revealed yesterday by the Minister of Mines and Energy.

So far, the reasons for the resignations of the Colombian government ministers are not clear.

Minister of Mines and Energy Oscar Mejía denied that this is a cabinet crisis, stating that the fate of the ministers is entirely up to the president to decide. The presidential spokesman also refused to comment on the matter. The opposition newspaper "El Siglo" in Colombia reported that President Barco plans to reorganize the cabinet before the parliament's Thursday meeting to discuss constitutional amendments, but it is unclear whether this is the reason for the ministers' resignations.
