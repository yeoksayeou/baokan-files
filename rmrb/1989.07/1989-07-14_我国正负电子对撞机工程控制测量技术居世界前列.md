China's positron-electron collider engineering control measurement technology was successfully appraised in Xi'an yesterday. The precision of the control network has reached the advanced level of similar projects worldwide.

Discovering new fundamental particles through positron-electron collisions is an advanced technique in contemporary high-tech fields, currently achievable by only a few developed countries. After the establishment of China's positron-electron collider laboratory, it was found that accurately fixing the position of each of the 370-plus electromagnetic iron blocks, each weighing several tons, and other precise components is crucial. If the radial error between adjacent points exceeds 0.2 millimeters, it will affect the collision of positrons and electrons.

The First Surveying and Mapping Brigade of the General Staff Department, tasked with control measurement, has, after more than a year of effort, selected the optimal scheme, reducing the horizontal control network error to just 0.05 millimeters. This precision far exceeds the control standard and has earned the brigade a national commendation from Premier Li Peng.

Experts from both military and civilian sectors attending the appraisal meeting agreed that the positron-electron collider engineering control measurement technology developed by the First Surveying and Mapping Brigade of the General Staff Department through practice has significant reference value for providing precise surveying and mapping guarantees for key projects in China's modernization drive.

    我国正负电子对撞机工程控制测量技术居世界前列
    新华社西安7月14日电　（中央人民广播电台记者王友齐、新华社记者胡年秋）我国正负电子对撞机工程控制测量技术，昨天在西安通过技术鉴定。控制网精度达到了世界同类工程的先进水平。
    通过正负电子对撞发现新的基本粒子，是当代高科技领域的一种先进手段，现今只有为数不多的几个发达国家才能办到。我国正负电子对撞实验室建立以后，在安装每块足有几吨重的370多块电磁铁和其它精密部件时，发现准确固定电磁铁的位置至关重要，相邻两点的径向误差如超过0.2毫米，就会影响正负电子的对撞。
    肩负控制测量任务的总参第一测绘大队经过一年多时间的努力，选出最佳方案，使水平控制网误差只有0.05毫米，精度大大高于控制标准，荣获李鹏总理颁发的国家嘉奖。
    参加鉴定会的军内外专家认为，总参第一测绘大队在实践中摸索出的这套正负电子对撞机工程控制测量技术，对于今后为我国现代化建设中的重点工程提供精确的测绘保障，有重大的借鉴价值。
