The Central Organization Department held a symposium on strengthening party building to commemorate July 1st in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, said at the meeting that without the Communist Party, there would be no increasingly powerful, reforming and opening-up socialist New China. The struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot has once again proved that our party is indeed a great, glorious, and correct party.

The symposium was chaired by Song Ping, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Minister of the Central Organization Department. Bo Yibo, Song Renqiong, and more than 50 old party members who joined the revolution before the War of Resistance Against Japan attended the symposium. Most of these old party members are standing committee members and members of the Central Advisory Commission, and there are also old comrades from other sectors.

Song Ping said that the struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital has achieved decisive victory, but the struggle is not over. All levels of party organizations must sum up the experience and lessons of this struggle and seriously rectify the party's ideology, organization, style of work, and system. Party members and cadres must also seriously examine their thoughts and actions during this turmoil. Through rectification, not only ideological problems must be solved, but organizational measures must also be taken according to different situations. The recently concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed the task of strengthening party building, and now we must seriously carry it out.

Song Ping said that in the past few years, ideological and political work has been weakened in the midst of repeated calls for "strengthening." Now, the Thirteenth Central Committee has clarified many major issues, and we must seriously carry out ideological and political work. We must study how to strengthen party building, improve party style, strengthen party organizations, and invigorate the spirit of the whole party.

Kang Shien, Wang Huishou, Chen Pishan, Wu Xiuquan, Hu Qiaomu, Huang Huoqing, Lu Dingyi, Geng Biao, Wang Shoudao, and other comrades spoke at the meeting. They proposed opinions and suggestions on learning and propagating Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, opposing bourgeois liberalization, carrying forward the party's fine traditions, strengthening ideological and political work, assessing party members and cadres, playing the role of enterprise party organizations, and strengthening the party's ideological and theoretical construction.

Jiang Zemin said in his concluding remarks that in the past two months, our party has undergone a life-and-death test. The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as their representative, played an important role in the critical moment of quelling the counter-revolutionary riot and stopping the turmoil. Today, the old comrades and old soldiers of our party are present. You have made great contributions to the founding and construction of New China. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, I express my high respect and cordial greetings to the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries and to all the old comrades present.

He said that many old comrades have just made good suggestions and proposals on strengthening party building. I hope that the old comrades will, as before, support and help us. We will strive to learn and apply the rich experience you have accumulated in long-term revolutionary struggle and construction practice in governing the party, the country, and the army, and draw wisdom and strength from it.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that the Communist Party of China is the unshakable leadership core of the cause of socialist modernization in China. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. This has been proven by modern and revolutionary history in China. Without the Communist Party, there would be no increasingly powerful, reforming and opening-up socialist New China. This has also been proven by the 40-year development history of the People's Republic of China. This struggle to stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot has once again proved that our party is powerful. This turmoil, from student movements to counter-revolutionary riots, was unprecedented in its rapid onset, complexity, seriousness, and harm in the history of our republic. At this critical moment concerning the fate of the party and the state, party organizations and the majority of party members, in general, have performed well and passed the test. Our party is invincible by any hostile forces.

Jiang Zemin said that we must be determined to carry out a serious rectification of party organizations from ideology to organization. He said that this struggle has also exposed many problems in our party organizations and party member ranks, some of which are quite serious. We must sum up the experience and lessons of this struggle, calmly review and think about the party's work, strengthen party building, and strengthen ideological and political work. Improving the quality of party members, strengthening the party's fighting capacity, this task has been prominently put before all party comrades.

He emphasized that we must adhere to the policy of "two hands" advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. The party must govern the party. Comrade Zhao Ziyang seriously neglected party building, and the combat effectiveness of party organizations has been weakened to varying degrees, with serious consequences. From now on, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee must adhere to the policy of "two hands" and change the situation of "one hand hard and one hand soft." Provincial, municipal, and county party committees, as well as grassroots party organizations in factories, rural areas, institutions, schools, and units, must focus on strengthening the party's own construction. Party organizations in enterprises and schools must strengthen ideological and political work and play a core role in this regard. A lean and professional team dedicated to ideological and political work must be built. Special attention must be paid to strengthening the party's ideological, style, organizational, and institutional construction in the process of reform and opening up.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that ideological rectification must be carried out seriously to improve the political quality of party members. Currently, the focus of ideological rectification is to study Comrade Xiaoping's important speeches and other documents, compare one's own thoughts and actions during this turmoil, sum up experiences and lessons, and unify one's understanding with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. We must persistently and seriously carry out three educations: first, education on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization; second, education on hard work; and third, education on discipline. On the basis of ideological rectification, serious organizational rectification must be carried out.

He emphasized that party leaders at all levels must take the lead and actually do a few things that will invigorate the hearts of the party and the people. He said that although we have achieved decisive victory in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, to truly win the trust of the people and strengthen party-mass relations, we must actually and seriously do a few things that the people care about.

Jiang Zemin said that our socialist cause has achieved great success and also faces many difficulties. We must not be complacent about the difficulties; we should rather be more cautious. With this mental preparation, our work will be more proactive. We must honestly tell the people about the existing difficulties and seek their understanding and support. The more difficulties there are, the more the country will prosper. The whole party and the people of the whole country must strive for self-improvement, work hard, and strive for self-reliance.

Jiang Zemin said that our new central leadership collective has just been formed, with a heavy responsibility and a long way to go. We must seriously implement the principle of democratic centralism, rely on the wisdom and strength of the central leadership collective, rely on the support of all party comrades and the people, and seriously and concretely do a good job. We will practice what we preach in executing party resolutions, observing party discipline, maintaining party unity, and strengthening party building; in adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up; and in hard work and opposing corruption. We sincerely accept the supervision of all party comrades and the people of the whole country. We firmly believe that the socialist cause opened up by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries will surely achieve new victories.

    ▲要下决心对各级党的组织从思想上到组织上进行一次认真的整顿

    新华社北京7月1日电（记者李尚志）中共中央组织部今天下午在中南海怀仁堂举行纪念“七一”大力加强党的建设座谈会。中共中央总书记江泽民在会上说，没有共产党就没有日益强大的、改革开放的社会主义新中国；这次制止动乱和平息暴乱的事实再一次雄辩地证明，我们的党不愧为伟大的党、光荣的党、正确的党。
    座谈会由中共中央政治局常委、中组部部长宋平主持。中顾委副主任薄一波、宋任穷和50多位抗日战争以前参加革命工作的老党员参加了座谈会。这些老党员大部分是中顾委的常委和委员，也有其他方面的老同志。
    宋平说，现在制止动乱、平息首都发生的反革命暴乱的斗争已经取得了决定性胜利，但斗争并没有结束。各级党组织都要很好地总结这场斗争的经验教训，把我们党从思想上、组织上、作风上、制度上认真整顿一下。党员干部也要认真检查自己在这场动乱中的思想和行动。通过整顿，不仅要解决思想问题，而且要分别情况，作出组织处理。刚刚闭幕的十三届四中全会，提出了大力加强党的建设的任务，现在就要认真抓起来。
    宋平说，前几年，思想政治工作在一片空喊“加强”声中被削弱了，党的建设放松了。现在，党的十三届四中全会对许多大的问题都明确了，我们要切切实实地把思想政治工作抓起来，要研究如何加强党的建设，把我们的党风搞好，把党的组织健全起来，把全党的精神振奋起来。
    康世恩、王鹤寿、陈丕显、伍修权、胡乔木、黄火青、陆定一、耿飚、王首道等同志，先后在会上发了言。他们就学习、宣传马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化，发扬党的优良传统，加强思想政治工作，考核党员干部，发挥企业党组织作用，加强党的思想理论建设等方面，提出了意见和建议。
    江泽民最后讲话说，近两个月来，我们党经历了一场生死存亡的考验。以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家，在平息反革命暴乱和制止动乱的关键时刻，力挽狂澜，发挥了重要的作用。今天到会的是我们党的老同志、老战士。你们为缔造和建设新中国做出了巨大贡献；我代表党中央，向老一辈无产阶级革命家，向在座的全体老同志，致以崇高的敬意和亲切的问候。
    他说，刚才许多老同志就加强党的建设发表了很好的意见和建议。希望老同志们一如既往，支持和帮助我们。我们将努力学习和运用你们在长期革命斗争和建设实践中积累起来的治党、治国和治军的丰富经验，从中汲取智慧和力量。
    江泽民强调指出，中国共产党是中国社会主义现代化建设事业不可动摇的领导核心。没有共产党，就没有新中国。这是为中国近代史和中国革命史所证明了的。没有共产党，就没有日益强大的、改革开放的社会主义新中国。这也是40年来中华人民共和国的发展史所证明了的。这次制止动乱和平息暴乱的斗争再次证明，我们党是有力量的。这次由学潮到动乱到反革命暴乱，其来势之迅猛，情况之复杂，性质之严重，危害之剧烈，在我们共和国的历史上是少有的。在这场关系到党和国家前途和命运的关键时刻，各级党组织和广大党员从总体上说，表现是好的，经受住了考验，我们的党是任何敌对势力也搞不垮的。
    江泽民说，要下决心对各级党的组织从思想上到组织上进行一次认真的整顿。他说，这场斗争也暴露了我们党的组织、党员队伍中存在着不少问题，有的还相当严重。我们要总结这场斗争的经验教训，冷静地回顾和思考党的工作，加强党的建设，加强思想政治工作。提高党员素质，加强党的战斗力，这个任务已经突出地摆到全党同志的面前。
    他强调，要坚持邓小平同志一贯倡导的两手抓的方针，党要管党。赵紫阳同志严重忽视党的建设，党组织的战斗力不同程度地受到削弱，造成的后果是极为严重的。我们中央政治局常委从现在起，就要坚持两手抓，切实改变一手硬一手软的状况。省、地、县党委，直至工厂、农村、机关、学校、连队等基层党组织，都要聚精会神抓好党的自身建设。企业和学校的党组织要切实加强思想政治工作，在这方面，发挥核心作用，要建设一支精干的专门从事思想政治工作的队伍。特别要注意在改革开放中加强党的思想、作风、组织和制度建设。
    江泽民指出，要认真进行思想整顿，提高党员政治素质。当前，思想整顿的重点，首先是通过学习小平同志的重要讲话等文件，对照自己在这场动乱中的思想和行动，总结经验教训，把认识统一到十三届四中全会的精神上来。要坚持不懈地认真抓好三个教育：一是抓好坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，二是抓好艰苦奋斗的教育，三是抓好纪律教育。在思想整顿的基础上认真进行组织整顿。
    他强调指出，党内各级领导干部一定要带头，切实办好几件党心民心为之振奋的事情。他说，我们虽然取得了平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利，但要真正取信于民，密切党群关系，还必须扎扎实实、严肃认真地办好几件人民群众普遍关心的事情。
    江泽民说，我国社会主义事业，已经取得了巨大的成就，也面临着许多困难。对困难，我们不能掉以轻心，宁可看得重一点。有了这个思想准备，我们的工作就会主动一些。我们要把存在的困难如实地告诉人民群众，取得人民群众的理解和支持。多难兴邦。全党和全国人民要励精图治，艰苦奋斗，自强不息。
    江泽民说，我们新的中央领导集体刚刚组成，任重道远。我们一定要认真贯彻民主集中制的原则，依靠中央领导集体的智慧和力量，依靠全党同志和人民群众的支持，认真切实地做好工作。我们将身体力行，在执行党的决议、遵守党的纪律、维护党的团结、加强党的建设方面做表率；在坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放方面做表率；在艰苦创业、反对腐败方面做表率。我们真心诚意地接受全党同志的监督，接受全国人民的监督。我们坚定地相信，老一辈无产阶级革命家开创的社会主义事业，一定会不断地取得新的胜利。
