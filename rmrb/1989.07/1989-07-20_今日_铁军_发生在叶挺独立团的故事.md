Xinhua News Agency, July 20th

The new generation of the Leaf Independent Regiment, which was renowned as the "Iron Army" during the Northern Expedition, has carried on the "Iron Army" spirit during this mission to Beijing to enforce martial law, adding a new chapter to the regiment's history.

A Persian Cat

In mid-June, the Leaf Independent Regiment was stationed in Tian Tan Park. Perhaps out of curiosity about the military camp, a Persian cat sneaked out of its owner's home and quietly made its way to a military vehicle parked under an ancient cypress tree.

The appearance of the little cat brought a bit of joy to the soldiers. However, it caused quite a stir for the cat's owner, Mr. Zhou, and the political instructor of the 4th Company, Sang Ximing, was also worried for the owner. As soon as it got dark, Sang, the political instructor, had the soldiers split into several groups to search door-to-door for the owner.

When Mr. Zhou took the little cat back from the soldiers, he repeatedly thanked them. The Persian cat also meowed at the soldiers, as if saying, "Hello" and "Thank you."

Two Public Cups

On June 20th, under an ancient cypress tree in Tian Tan Park, a worker shook hands with Major Ma Shuanghai, deputy chief of staff of the Leaf Independent Regiment, saying, "The People's Liberation Army is truly disciplined."

It turned out that after the Leaf Independent Regiment withdrew from Tian Tan Park and moved to a new location, the regiment's security guard discovered two extra teacups while checking the items. Upon closer inspection, they realized these were public teacups from Tian Tan Park. The security guard felt he had made a mistake and immediately reported to the regiment's political commissar, Zhang Wenbin, and conducted a self-criticism.

Zhang Wenbin listened and looked at his watch: "It's late today. Tomorrow morning, you and Deputy Chief of Staff Ma return the teacups and apologize to them."

The next day, Major Ma Shuanghai led the security guard to Tian Tan Park to return the teacups, which led to the scene described above.

Descendants of the Iron Army

In the early hours of June 4th, this regiment arrived at the south gate of the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall on the east side of Zhengyang Gate, ahead of all the surrounding martial law enforcement units.

At this time, the soldiers were starving and exhausted. Suddenly, the small stalls in front of the memorial hall caught the soldiers' eyes. Upon closer inspection, they saw canned goods, pastries, and soft drinks on the shelves. However, the stalls were unattended. The soldiers gathered around the stalls and started discussing:

"Saving people is the priority, who cares if there's someone here or not!"

"Or we can take whatever we want from the stalls, leave the money, or leave a note."

At this moment, He Chun, the cultural work officer of the regiment's political department, reminded everyone, "Comrades, you all have good points, but we must not forget that we are the descendants of the Iron Army!"

These words immediately garnered a chorus of agreement: "Right, we can't let the Iron Army's reputation be tarnished by us!"

Thus, everyone endured the torture of hunger and pain, holding out for a full 30 hours. Thirteen soldiers fainted from hunger and exhaustion, but not a single person touched any of the food in the stalls.

    今日“铁军”
    ——发生在叶挺独立团的故事
    新华社记者　陈焱　曹国强
    北伐时期曾以“铁军”著称于世的叶挺独立团的新一代，在这次进京执行戒严任务中，发扬“铁军”精神，为团史增添了新的篇章。
        一只波斯猫
    六月中旬，叶挺独立团进驻天坛公园。也许是出于对军营的好奇，有只波斯猫竟瞒着主人，悄悄溜出家们，蹑手蹑脚地来到一棵古柏旁停的军用汽车底下。
    小花猫的出现，给战士们添了一丝欢乐。然而，可把猫的主人周师傅急坏了，四连指导员桑西明也在替失主着急。天刚擦黑，桑指导员便让战士们兵分几路，挨门挨户寻失主。
    当周师傅从战士手中接过小花猫时，连声道谢。波斯猫也冲着战士们“咪——咪”地叫了两声，好像在说：“你好”、“谢谢”。
        两只公用杯
    六月二十日，天坛公园一棵古柏下，一位工作人员握着叶挺独立团副参谋长马双海少校的手说：“还是解放军纪律严明。”
    原来，叶挺独立团撤出天坛公园进驻新的驻地后，团部警卫员在清点物品时，发现多了两只茶杯。仔细一瞧，才知道这两只茶杯是天坛公园的公用杯。警卫员感到自己出了错，立即向团政委张文品报告，并做了自我批评。
    张文品听后看看表：“今天不早了。明天一早，你和马副参谋长把茶杯送回，向人家赔礼道歉。”
    第二天，马双海少校带领警卫员，专程驱车来到天坛公园还茶杯，这才有了开头那一幕。
        铁军的后代
    六月四日凌晨，这个团先于所有外围戒严部队抵达正阳门东侧的毛主席纪念堂南门。
    这时，官兵们一个个饥肠辘辘，又饿又累。突然，纪念堂前的一个个小商亭映入战士们的眼帘，大家走近一瞧，货架上有罐头，有糕点，有汽水饮料。可是，商亭无人看管。大家围着商亭议论开了：
      “现在救人要紧，管它有人无人！”
      “要不然，我们拿商亭多少东西，按价把钱留下，或者留个字条也行呀。”
    这时，团政治处群工干事何淳提醒大家说：“同志们说得都有道理，可我们不能忘了，我们是铁军的后代！”
    一句话，立即引起一片赞同声：“对，铁军的牌子决不能砸在我们手里！”
    就这样，大家忍受着饥饿的煎熬和伤痛的折磨，整整坚持了三十小时，十三名战士因饥累交加昏迷过去，但没一人动商亭里的任何食物。
