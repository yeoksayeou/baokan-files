Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, July 26th.

The North Korean newspaper *Rodong Sinmun* today commented on South Korea's claim of being prepared to "join the United Nations alone," stating that North and South Korea can only join the United Nations under a single country name after achieving a federal system. Otherwise, it will only solidify the division of Korea.

South Korean Foreign Minister Choi Ho-jung, who is currently visiting the United States, said in a speech at the World Cultural Association in San Francisco on the 22nd that South Korea has made preparations to "join the United Nations alone." South Korean public opinion believes that Choi Ho-jung's advocacy for South Korea to "join the United Nations alone" indicates that South Korea's policy of demanding that North and South Korea "join the United Nations simultaneously" has changed.

    朝鲜报纸谈加入联合国
    北南方应使用一个国号
    新华社平壤7月26日电  朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天就南朝鲜宣称准备“单独加入联合国”发表评论指出，朝鲜南北方只能在实现联邦制后以一个国号加入联合国，否则只会固定朝鲜的分裂局面。
    正在美国访问的南朝鲜外务部长官崔浩中22日在旧金山世界文化协会发表的演说中说，南朝鲜已做好了“单独加入联合国”的准备。南朝鲜舆论认为，崔浩中宣扬南方“单独加入联合国”一事表明，南朝鲜历来要求南北方“同时加入联合国”的政策发生了变化。
