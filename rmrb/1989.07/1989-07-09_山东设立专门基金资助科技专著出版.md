Shandong Establishes Special Fund to Support the Publication of Scientific and Technological Monographs

    Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Chen Shurong reports: Amidst the complaints of many academic works being unable to be published due to insufficient funds from publishers, several academic works have been successfully published with the help of publication funds. On July 8th, when Shandong Science and Technology Press presented "Integrated Transportation System Engineering," "History of Thermodynamics," "Pollution of Ion Exchange Resins," and "Abstract Space Ordinary Differential Equations" and other works to the public, President Wang Weizhen announced the commencement of the release ceremony for the first batch of monographs subsidized by the 1988 "Taishan Science and Technology Monograph Publication Fund."

    Last June, Shandong Science and Technology Press established a 500,000 yuan publication fund for the first time in the domestic publishing industry, launching a nationwide call for outstanding scientific and technological monographs. The review committee collectively selected more than 30 topics, with 15 monographs included in the annual publication plan, basically achieving the goal of publishing a book within 4 months after the author completes the manuscript.

    山东设立专门基金资助科技专著出版
    本报讯　记者陈树荣报道：在许多学术著作因出版社资金不足而告难产的怨声中，却有几部受惠出版基金的学术著作顺产了。7月8日，当山东科学技术出版社把《综合运输系统工程》、《热力学史》、《离子交换树脂的污染》、《抽象空间常微分方程》等著作一一摆放在众人面前时，王为珍社长宣布1988年度“泰山科技专著出版基金”补贴出版的第一批专著发行仪式开始。
    山东科技出版社去年6月在国内出版界首次设立了50万元的出版基金，开展了全国性的征集优秀科技专著活动，评审委员会集体评选出30多个选题，15部专著列入年度出版计划，基本实现了作者脱稿后4个月出书的要求。
