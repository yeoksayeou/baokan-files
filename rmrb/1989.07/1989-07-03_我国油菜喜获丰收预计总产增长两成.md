Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 3rd.

This year, China's rapeseed harvest is expected to be bountiful, with a projected total production increase of 20% compared to 1988.

Last autumn, most of China's rapeseed-producing regions had sufficient moisture for sowing, which facilitated timely planting. The mild winter temperatures were beneficial for rapeseed growth. Additionally, several timely rains during the winter and spring seasons resulted in better growth conditions compared to the previous year, leading to higher podding rates and increased seed weight per thousand seeds.

According to statistics from 21 summer rapeseed-producing regions, including Jiangsu and Henan, the total rapeseed planting area in China reached 75.07 million mu, an increase of 5 million mu compared to the previous year. The projected total rapeseed production is 16.69 million dan, an increase of 20.7% compared to the previous year.

    我国油菜喜获丰收预计总产增长两成
    新华社北京7月3日电　（记者余富棠）今年我国油菜喜获丰收，预计油菜籽总产量比1988年增产两成。
    去年秋天，我国大部分油菜产区播种墒情足，利于适时播种，冬季气温偏暖，对油菜生长有利；加上冬春以来连降几场及时雨，使油菜长势好于去年，结荚率高，千籽重增加。
    据江苏、河南等21个夏季油菜籽产区统计，全国油菜播种面积达7507万亩，比上年扩大500万亩，预计油菜籽总产量可达1669万担，比上年增产20.7％。
