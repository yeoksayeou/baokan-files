According to the latest data provided by the State Statistical Bureau, the growth of the workforce in China has slowed down in the first half of this year. By the end of June, the total number of workers in the country was 134.99 million, a decrease of 1.09 million compared to the end of last year. This is the first time in nearly a decade that such a decrease has occurred. However, due to the need to place college graduates and other factors in the second half of the year, controlling the total number of workers will be challenging.

In the first quarter of this year, due to the retirement of a large number of older workers, the dismissal of non-planned workers, and the expiration of contracts for some contract workers, the number of workers decreased significantly. By the end of March, the number of workers had decreased by 1.75 million compared to the end of last year, marking the lowest point of the year. Starting in April, the number of workers began to increase again. Currently, in state-owned enterprises, except for college graduates and demobilized soldiers allocated by the state, almost all new workers are hired under contract. The proportion of contract workers in state-owned enterprises has increased from 4% three years ago to 10.5%.

The industry with the most significant decrease in the number of workers in the first half of the year is urban construction. In addition to hundreds of thousands of rural construction teams returning to the countryside, the urban construction industry has reduced its workforce by 275,000 compared to the end of last year.

    全国职工半年减少百万
    下半年增员因素多  控制总人数难度大
    本报北京7月19日讯　记者张国荣报道：据国家统计局提供的最新材料，今年上半年我国职工人数回增缓慢，截至6月底，全国职工人数为13499万，比上年底减少109万，这是近10年来仅有的。但下半年因要安置统一分配的大中专毕业生等增人因素很多，要实现今年国家控制职工人数增加的计划难度仍较大。
    今年第1季度，由于大批老职工离退休，计划外用工被清退，部分合同制职工合同到期未能续订，职工人数大量减少。3月底比上年底减少175万人，是今年职工人数最低点。自4月份起职工人数开始回增。目前全民所有制单位除国家统一分配的大中专学校毕业生和退伍军人外，新增职工几乎全部实行了合同制，占全民单位全部职工的比重已由3年前的4％上升到10.5％。
    上半年职工人数减少最多的是城市建筑业，除数百万农民建筑队返回农村外，城市建筑业比上年底减少职工27.5万。
