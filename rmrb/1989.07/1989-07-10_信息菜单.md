Recently, in some restaurants and hotels in Japan, a new type of "information menu" has become popular. This new menu not only lists the names and prices of dishes like traditional menus, but also provides detailed information about each dish. This includes the caloric content, salt levels, and cholesterol content, as well as the origin of the meat and vegetables used, the cultivation methods, and the seasonings employed.

The creator of the "information menu" capitalized on the growing public concern for health, the fear of overeating leading to obesity and "affluent diseases." They believed that for consumers in the information age, a menu should not merely be a price list, but an important medium for providing dietary information.

Since its introduction, the "information menu" has been widely welcomed by many customers. However, it has also faced opposition from some. "Originally, I just wanted to enjoy a good meal, but seeing the 'information menu' reminded me of the dietary restrictions given by doctors in hospitals. My appetite was immediately dampened."

    信息菜单
    最近，在日本的一些餐馆、饭店开始流行一种“信息菜单”。这种新型菜单不仅像以往的菜单那样标明菜的名称和价钱，而且还向就餐者提供每个菜的各种信息，从这个菜所含的热量、盐分、胆固醇到菜中使用的肉类、蔬菜的产地、栽培的方法和使用的作料等非常详细。
    “信息菜单”的发明者抓住了大众对健康关心的程度普遍提高，担心过量的饮食会使身体发胖，易得“富贵病”的心理，认为对于信息时代的消费者，菜单不应该是单纯的价格表，而应成为能够提供“饮食信息”的重要媒介。
    “信息菜单”一问世，即受到广大顾客的普遍欢迎，但也遭到一部分人的反对，“本来想痛痛快快地享受一下美味佳肴，可见了‘信息菜单’，就想起了医院里医生给病人规定的饮食，挺旺盛的食欲一下子就减退了。”　　宋朝晖
