This year, more than 2,100 party members in the rural areas of Xiangyuan County, Shanxi Province, have emerged as leaders in helping farmers achieve prosperity. They have been dedicated to serving the people, undertaking practical initiatives, and becoming the backbone of rural economic development.

Xiangyuan County, located in the Taihang Mountains, has 6,500 party members in its rural areas. In recent years, the county committee has repeatedly used party schools and other platforms to educate these members on how to serve the people by doing good deeds and leading farmers to shared prosperity. Statistics show that party members in the county have helped 1,321 impoverished households to initially escape poverty. They have contributed 112,000 man-days of labor to rural public welfare projects and donated 890,000 yuan in funds and materials.

Chang Jinfang, the party branch secretary of Taoyuan Village in Chengguan Town, established a small coal mine with an annual output of 40,000 tons to help more than 300 farming households escape poverty. The mine generated over 200,000 yuan in revenue, but Chang only took a monthly subsidy of 45 yuan. Until his death in June, his family had no decent furniture, and they had only 20 yuan in cash. The villagers were so moved that they wept uncontrollably. Man Shouping, a party member from Ande Village in Yuanzhuang Township, voluntarily took over a nearly ruined apple orchard. After reviving the orchard, he transferred the management of the fruiting orchard to others. He also founded a family-run apple technology school at his own expense, training 40 technical personnel. Last year, the township's per capita income from apples alone reached 250 yuan. Man Shouping said, "Helping fellow villagers achieve prosperity is the duty of a Communist Party member."

    襄垣县党员争当排头兵
    为群众办实事　领大伙走富路
    本报太原电　记者王艾生报道：今年以来，山西省襄垣县农村涌现出2100余名带领农民致富的好党员，他们为群众办实事，办好事，成为发展农村经济的骨干。
    地处太行山区的襄垣农村有6500名党员。近几年，县委利用党校等阵地反复教育他们为群众办好事办实事，带领农民共同致富。据统计，全县党员扶持、帮助贫困户初步脱贫的1321户，为农村社会公益事业投工11.2万个，集资捐款89万余元。
    城关镇桃村党支部书记常金芳，为使300多户农民脱贫，他办了一个年产4万吨的小煤矿，收入20余万元，而他每月只拿45元补助金。直到6月他去世，家里没有像样的家具，全家只有20元现金。村民们感动得痛哭不已。原庄乡安德村党员满守平，主动承包了一个濒于破败的苹果园，当果园起死回生后，他却把挂果的果园转让给别人去承包。他还自费创办家庭苹果技术学校，已培养出技术人员40名。去年该乡仅苹果收入人均就达250元。满守平说：“帮助乡亲们致富，是共产党员的本分。”
