The National Football First Division League has seen intense matches in four regions in recent days, sparking a wave of "football fever."

In the A group, the match on July 1st in Qingdao between Liaoning and Shanghai was fiercely contested in a packed stadium. Liaoning maintained a strong offensive throughout the game. In the 11th minute of the second half, goalkeeper Fu Yubin kicked off a swift attack with a long ball, and No. 20 Huang Chong made a solo run, breaking through Shanghai's defense to score. Liaoning won 1-0.

In the Dalian region, two teams from southern China faced off in a brotherly contest. Guangdong had no advantage and was quite passive at times, eventually winning 1-0 against Guangzhou. The National Second Team struggled against Shandong's intense pressure, with tall strikers Zhai Chao and Hu Wei failing to score with their headers. It wasn't until the final minutes that No. 12 Li Bing scored in the chaos, tying the game at 1-1.

So far, after just two rounds in the A group, no team has remained undefeated. The B group matches will resume on July 2nd. In the Zhengzhou region, Dalian won 1-0 against Tianjin Tianrong with a penalty kick. Hubei scored four goals in the second half, winning 4-2 against Hebei. Jiangsu drew 0-0 with Hunan. In the Changsha region, heavy rain turned the field into a muddy quagmire. Henan won a hard-fought 2-1 victory against Beijing, with three players from each team receiving yellow cards. The Shenyang Military Region team, after conceding two goals, saw their players blame each other, unable to turn the game around, losing 0-2 to the Beijing Military Region team. Shenyang won 2-0 against Tianjin Port Team.

    全国足球甲级联赛四赛区激战正酣
    本报综合消息　全国足球甲级队联赛连日来在4个赛区掀起一阵“足球热”。
  A组7月1日在青岛进行的一场比赛，辽宁队和上海队在座无虚席的体育场里踢得相当卖劲。辽宁队自始至终保持较强的攻势。下半时第11分钟，门将傅玉斌大脚开球发动急攻，20号黄崇单骑突击，攻破上海队大门，辽宁队以1∶0获胜。
    大连赛区，来自南国的两支球队展开兄弟之争，广东队并无优势，一度相当被动，最后仅以1∶0小胜广州队。国家二队在山东队的逼抢下，进攻不大顺手，身高1米90的高中锋翟飚和胡伟头球不占便宜，直至终场前，才由12号黎兵在乱军丛中破门，扳成1平。
    至此，刚刚开始两轮的A组比赛，便无一队保持全胜。B组的比赛7月2日再战。郑州赛区，大连队罚点球1∶0胜天津天荣队。湖北队下半时连进四球，4∶2胜河北队。江苏队0∶0平湖南队。长沙赛区，连日大雨使球场变成泥沼。河南队2∶1战胜北京队的一场恶战，双方各有三人被罚黄牌。沈阳军区队在连失两球后，自家球员互相埋怨，以致无法挽回局面，以0∶2负于北京军区队。沈阳队2∶0胜天津港集队。
