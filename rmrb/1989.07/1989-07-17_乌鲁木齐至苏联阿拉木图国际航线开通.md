From the People's Daily, Urumqi

A Tupolev Tu-154 aircraft from the Civil Aviation Administration of the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic recently arrived here. Its arrival marks the formal opening of the international air route between these two cities.

The reporter learned from a news conference held by Xinjiang Airlines that on July 28th, a Tu-154 aircraft from Xinjiang Airlines will also make its maiden flight to Almaty, Soviet Union. This route is 980 kilometers long, and both Chinese and Soviet aircraft will fly one round trip every Tuesday and Friday. This route significantly shortens the distance between Europe and Asia.
