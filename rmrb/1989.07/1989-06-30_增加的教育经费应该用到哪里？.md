This year, the state has decided to increase educational funds. This is undoubtedly good news for the educational sector. However, there are also concerns. Will the educational funds allocated by the state be used entirely for educational purposes? This is indeed a matter of great concern. In the past, some newspapers reported that many schools in certain places have a large number of dilapidated buildings and poor teaching equipment, but the educational funds have been squeezed or misappropriated by relevant departments. Some educational funds have been used to build cadre dormitories and directors' residences, while others have been used to purchase luxury cars. Recently, according to a report by a certain newspaper, the relevant state departments audited the use of educational funds in more than 8,000 schools, and the total amount of funds that were squeezed or misappropriated reached over 420 million yuan. This indicates that in many places, some leaders do not take the educational cause seriously, or they believe that education is flexible and that squeezing out some funds is not a big deal.

I suggest that the state should have a clear and detailed regulation on the use of educational funds and formulate a law on the use of educational funds. Anyone who misappropriates or squeezes educational funds should be punished. Only in this way can those who arbitrarily misappropriate or squeeze educational funds be deterred. If this is not done, then no matter how much the educational funds are increased, they will still be intercepted and misappropriated along the way, and the prosperity and development of China's educational sector may remain an empty promise.

    增加的教育经费应该用到哪里？
    上海　池文
    今年国家决定增加教育经费。这对于教育事业来说，无疑是个喜讯。然而，人们也有担忧的地方。国家下拨的教育经费，是不是都用于教育事业？这实在是个令人关注的问题。过去一些报纸报道，说某些地方的学校危房甚多，教学设备极差，但教育经费却被有关部门挤占、挪用。有的教育经费被用来建造干部宿舍、局长住宅，有的被用来购买豪华小轿车，等等。前不久，据某报报道，国家有关部门审计了8000多所学校教育经费的使用情况，教育经费被挤占、挪用的总数竟达4.2亿多元。这说明，在不少地方，有的领导同志根本不把教育事业放在眼里，或者认为办教育是有伸缩性的，挤掉点经费无关大局。
    我建议，国家应对教育经费的使用，有一个明确而详尽的规定，制订一种对教育经费使用的法律。谁挪用、挤占了教育经费，就要受到制裁。只有这样，才能使那些随便挤占、挪用教育经费的人有所收敛和害怕。如果不这样做，那么教育经费增加再多，也会被半途截走和挤占、挪用，我国教育事业的兴旺发达仍可能是一句空话。
