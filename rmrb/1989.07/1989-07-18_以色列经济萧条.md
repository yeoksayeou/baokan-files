	Israel's Finance Minister Peres recently admitted in a televised speech that Israel's economy has experienced a downturn this year, and the situation is more severe than expected.

	According to recent data released by Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics, due to the uprising by Palestinians, Arab workers from the West Bank and Gaza Strip have stopped coming to Israel for work, leading to a sharp decrease in Israel's exports to the West Bank and Gaza. Both domestic and foreign investments have significantly decreased, while military spending has increased substantially. In the first four months of this year, Israel's economy experienced stagflation, with industrial and agricultural production declining. The construction industry was the hardest hit, with production value dropping by 25% this year. The agricultural sector was also severely affected, with the national debt of farms exceeding $1.1 billion.

	Israel's tourism industry, a significant economic source, has also seen a sharp decline, with tourists decreasing by half compared to previous years. Hotels and restaurants are operating at half capacity. The downturn in tourism has affected Israel's national airline, which has had to reduce flights, lease or sell some of its planes, and lay off a large number of employees.

	The report from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics also revealed that Israel's foreign trade exports have decreased sharply, and the trade deficit has increased. The inflation rate has reached 16%, and the unemployment rate has risen from 7% last year to 8.2%. The average wage income of workers has decreased by 7.4%. Israeli leaders have acknowledged that the nearly 20-month-long Palestinian uprising has caused Israel approximately $1 billion in economic losses.

    以色列经济萧条
    以色列财政部长佩雷斯最近在一次电视讲话中承认，今年以来，以色列经济出现萧条，情况比预料的还严重。
    据以色列中央统计局最近公布的材料，由于巴勒斯坦人的起义斗争，约旦河西岸和加沙地带的阿拉伯廉价劳动力停止前往以色列做工，以色列对西岸和加沙的出口锐减。国内外的投资显著减少。而国防开支则大幅度增长。今年头4个月，以经济发生滞涨，工农业生产出现滑坡，其中建筑业受到的损失最为突出，今年以来产值下降了25％。农业部门也受到严重影响，以全国农场的债务已超过11亿美元。
    作为以色列重要经济来源的旅游业也显得冷冷清清，游客比往年减少一半，旅馆和饭店也处于半停业状态。旅游业不景气，影响到以色列航空公司的业务，不得不减少班机，出租或出售其部分飞机，并大量裁减人员。
    以色列中央统计局的报告还透露，以色列的外贸出口锐减，贸易赤字增加。通货膨胀率达16％，失业率由去年的7％上升到8.2％，职工平均工资收入下降了7.4％。以色列领导人承认，近20个月的巴勒斯坦人的起义斗争已使以经济损失约十亿美元。
