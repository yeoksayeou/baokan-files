Don't Make a Scene on the Highway!

I heard that on the road from Chang (Nanchang) to Gan (Ganzhou), some individual operators of passenger cars were unhappy with the national-operated buses picking up passengers at small stops along the way, so they looked for trouble and stirred up incidents. I was skeptical. Each does their own business, and if everyone adheres to professional ethics, shouldn't everything be fine?

On June 19th, I took a national-operated passenger car (Jiangxi 33—00544) from Xingan County to Nanchang City. When we passed through the Yongtai section of Zhangshu City, I saw this scene: an individual-operated passenger car driver drove a 130 passenger car to block the middle of the road, and another driver threw stones at the national-operated bus's taillight, claiming that the other side had taken their business. Their attitude was so arrogant that it was hard to describe. Look at the second person from the right in the photo, he truly has the look of someone making a scene.

According to the national-operated bus driver and passengers, similar incidents have occurred in other sections, but they are more frequent on the Yongtai section. To maintain traffic order and convenience for passengers, relevant departments should strengthen the management of individual-operated passenger cars.

    别在公路上撒泼！
    听说（南）昌赣（州）路上，有些客运车个体户对国营客车中途小站载客不满，便寻衅找事，挑起事端。我将信将疑。你干你的，他干他的，大家都讲职业道德，不是平安无事吗？
    六月十九日，我乘新干县开往南昌市的国营客车（江西三三—○○五四四），路经樟树市永泰路段时，却见这般情景，一个体户客车司机驾一辆一三○客运小汽车横阻在路中央，另一司机用石块击国营客车尾灯，说对方抢了他们的生意，态度之蛮横，难以言状。瞧瞧照片上车侧右起第二人那神情，真是副撒泼像。
    据国营客车司机和乘客反映：类似事件，其它地段也有发生，只是这永泰路段较为频繁而已。为了维护交通秩序，方便乘客，有关部门应加强对客运车个体户的管理。
