Our Xiangfan Station is a hub for the Xiangyu and Jiao-Zhi lines, with a high volume of passengers. Although each of our shifts has dozens of service staff serving tens of thousands of passengers daily, the workload is immense. We still strive to do our service work better. More than 90% of our service staff are women, many of whom have families to support. Whenever we see passengers struggling with large bags or traveling with children, we feel sympathetic. For the safety of the passengers, we have to pull those who are hanging onto the doors or windows off the train. However, these passengers do not understand us; they either punch us or use foul language. Some passengers buy substandard food and take out their frustration on us. After the train starts moving, some people spit on us, throw bottles, flick cigarette butts, and even say obscene things, making some unmarried female attendants cry. These incidents have become common for us.

According to railway regulations, service personnel must clear the station. However, this has become one of our most challenging tasks. Facing thousands of people on the platform, we almost have to beg them to leave, and our voices go hoarse, often with little effect. Especially during the spring transportation season, we are so busy that we don't even have time to eat. When we encounter passengers with bad tempers, we are even more unfortunate. Our station master and director are most afraid that we will argue with passengers. If we curse at passengers, we have to write self-criticisms and have our bonuses deducted. But if passengers curse at us? They just curse and that's it.

Now, our greatest wish is that passengers can understand the difficulties of railway passenger service work.

### 请理解铁路客运服务工作

专栏：心里话

    请理解铁路客运服务工作
    我们襄樊车站，交汇了襄渝、焦枝两条干线，客流量大。尽管我们每个班几十名服务员每天要为几万名旅客服务，劳动强度很大。但我们还是想把服务工作做得好一些。我们服务员90％以上都是女同志，许多人有老有小。每当看到旅客们携着大包小包或拖儿带女上不去车的情景，我们也很同情。为了旅客的安全，我们不得不把那些扒在车门、车窗上的旅客拉下车来。可是，这些旅客对我们不理解，对我们不是挥拳头，就是骂脏话。有的旅客买了伪劣食品，也把气出在我们身上。每当列车开动后，有的人往我们身上吐口水，扔酒瓶，弹烟头，有的还说下流话，气得一些没结婚的女乘务员直哭。这些事，对我们来说已是司空见惯了。
    按照铁路规章，服务人员要清站。可是这又成为我们最头疼的一项工作。面对站台上成百上千的人群，我们几乎是求爹爹告奶奶地请他们走，嗓子都喊哑了，往往收效甚微。尤其是铁路春运期间，我们忙得连吃饭的功夫都没有，遇上个别脾气大的旅客，我们更倒霉。我们站长、主任最怕我们跟旅客吵架，要是我们骂旅客，又是写检查，又是扣奖金。可是，旅客骂我们呢？骂了不就骂了。
    现在，我们最大的愿望，是希望乘客理解铁路客运服务工作的苦衷就行了。
