    Shadow Cabinet

    In Western countries, the opposition party in parliament, as a party out of power, in order to adapt to the struggle with the ruling party, forms a preparatory cabinet within its parliamentary group according to the organizational form of the cabinet. This group is called the "shadow cabinet," also known as the "preparatory cabinet" or "opposition cabinet." During parliamentary policy debates, the "ministers" of the shadow cabinet each speak on their respective areas, proposing their views and suggestions. In 1907, the British Conservative Party established the world's first shadow cabinet.

    影子内阁
    在西方国家中，作为议会反对派的在野政党，为适应同执政党进行斗争的需要，在其议会党团内按照内阁的组织形式组成一个准备上台执政的班子，这个班子被称为“影子内阁”，又称“预备内阁”、“在野内阁”。在议会进行政策辩论时，影子内阁的“部长”们各自就有关方面发言，提出其主张和建议。1907年英国保守党设立了世界上最早的影子内阁。·晋标·
