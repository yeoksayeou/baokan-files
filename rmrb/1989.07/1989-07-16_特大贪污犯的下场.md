On June 27th, the Intermediate People's Court of Huaihua Region in Hunan Province publicly tried a major embezzlement and misappropriation case involving over 380,000 yuan at the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Xinxiang County. The court sentenced two defendants, Hu and Wu, to death and stripped them of their political rights for life.

The main culprit, Hu Qilin, a 23-year-old male, was formerly an employee of the Xinxiang County branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. The other main culprit, Wu Wenbo, a 22-year-old male, was formerly an employee of the Shizishan Power Station in Xinxiang County. They colluded with each other, using their positions to embezzle 23 transactions totaling over 380,000 yuan from 20 enterprises, including the Xinxiang Cigarette Factory. They forged transfer vouchers 15 times, falsely using the names of six units, including the Xinxiang Timber Company, to transfer over 280,000 yuan to Guangzhou, Huaihua, and other places. They also misappropriated over 100,000 yuan to cover part of the embezzled funds, attempting to conceal their crimes. After the case was exposed, the county committee and county government quickly formed a special investigation team led by the county prosecutor's office and allocated a jeep and necessary fuel to the team. With the assistance of various local party and government departments, prosecutors, public security agencies, and relevant units, the case was solved in just over two months, and the two defendants were apprehended. By the time of the court's verdict, nearly 180,000 yuan in economic losses had been recovered. The other six individuals involved in the case have also been dealt with in separate cases.

    特大贪污犯的下场
    6月27日，湖南省怀化地区中级人民法院在新晃侗族自治县公开审理了该县工商银行发生的38万多元的特大贪污、挪用案，依法判处胡、吴二犯死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
    主犯胡启林，男，23岁，原是中国工商银行新晃县支行干部。主犯吴文波，男，22岁，原是新晃县狮子岩电站职工。他们狼狈为奸，利用职务上的便利，共同窃取新晃卷烟厂等20家企业在县工商银行的23笔货款，共计38万多元，先后15次伪造转款凭证，假冒新晃木材公司等6个单位的名义，将其中的28万多元汇往广州、怀化等地领取，并挪用十万多元填充作案窃取的部分货款，以掩饰罪行。案发后，县委、县政府很快组成以县检察院为主体的专案小组，并挤出一台吉普车和必需的油料给检察院专案组用。在各地党政部门、检察机关、公安机关和有关单位的大力协助下，只用了二个多月时间就侦破此案，将胡、吴二犯抓获。到法庭判决之时，此案已经追回经济损失近18万元。涉及此案的其他6名违法犯罪人员也已作另案处理。
