Thirty-six soldiers who were separated from their unit found themselves surrounded. In the midst of danger, eight party members stepped forward—here is the story of a "temporary party branch."

In the ranks of advanced party branches commended by the Party Committee of a certain unit of the martial law troops, there is a party branch that no longer exists in fact but was specially commended. This is the party branch temporarily established on June 3 by 36 soldiers (including 8 party members) who were separated from their unit and surrounded when the unit was ordered to enter the city. Although this temporary party branch existed for only two days, its deeds have had a very good impact among the soldiers of this unit.

On June 3, the unit, upon orders from the Central Military Commission, marched into the city. During their march, the unit encountered obstacles, beatings, and attacks, and many soldiers were separated from their unit. At around 1 a.m. on June 4, at the North Gate of Tian Tan Park, 36 soldiers who had been separated and regrouped were surrounded by tens of thousands of people. Stones and bottles rained down on the soldiers, leaving them injured and in a dire situation. Because their radios and walkie-talkies were destroyed, communication with their superiors was cut off, and they could not receive orders.

In this critical moment, the soldiers spontaneously thought of relying on the party organization. At the request of the soldiers, the eight party members gathered together and held an emergency party meeting, establishing a temporary party branch. They elected the deputy chief of staff, Zhu Yonghe, as the branch secretary, and the organizational staff officer, Liu Qicai, and the security officer, Yang Xiangliang, as deputy secretaries. Two company commanders and two staff officers were elected as branch committee members. The temporary party branch carefully analyzed the current situation and determined a plan of action in the absence of superior orders. They established working groups under the leadership of the temporary party branch for command, propaganda, mass work, internal mobilization, and medical aid, and actively carried out their work. The Communist Party member and deputy chief of staff, Zhu Yonghe, had his head and waist injured by stones, but he endured the pain and convened a branch committee meeting to analyze the situation and study the plan of action, staying awake for two whole days. The Communist Party member and organizational staff officer, Wang Li, was seriously injured in the head by a large stone during the march and was in critical condition by the time they reached Tian Tan Park. His pupils were dilated, and his life was in danger. After the medical aid group worked tirelessly to persuade the crowd to find a doctor for emergency treatment, he was saved. Upon regaining consciousness, the first thing he did was to pick up a megaphone to do propaganda work. He told the deputy chief of staff, Zhu, who advised him to rest, "I am a propagandist, and this is the time for me to play my role. How can I lie down?" Their actions moved some of the crowd to voluntarily protect the soldiers. A young worker named Pan Gen led them into the park and finally got the park to open its gates, allowing the soldiers to enter the park and escape the danger of being attacked and beaten. The Communist Party member and organizational staff officer, Liu Qicai, endured unbearable hunger and thirst and gave his water and rations to the soldiers. During the two days they were surrounded in the park, the temporary party branch became the mainstay of the 36 surrounded soldiers.

The soldiers drew spiritual strength from the temporary party branch and the party members, and everyone united as one, persevering in their work. After two days of hard work, with the support of the unit, they finally broke through the siege and returned to the main unit victoriously.

　　三十六名被冲散的官兵陷入围困。
    危急中，八名党员挺身而出——
    这里有“临时党支部”
    在戒严部队某部党委表彰的先进党支部行列中，有一个事实上已不存在了的党支部特别受到表彰。她就是这个部队6月3日奉命进京时，被冲散的36名官兵（其中8名党员），在同大部队失去联系，陷入围困时，临时成立的党支部。这个临时党支部，虽然仅仅存在两天，但她的事迹在这个部队官兵中产生了很好的反响。
    6月3日，部队奉中央军委命令，向城区开进，徒步行进中，部队一路受到拦阻、殴打、冲击，许多官兵被冲散。6月4日凌晨一时许，在天坛公园北门，有36名被冲散而聚集到一起的官兵，被成千上万的人群团团困住，石块、酒瓶雨点般地向部队砸来，官兵们一个个伤痕累累，情势十分危急。由于电台和步话机被砸坏，同上级的联络中断，听不到上级指示。
    危难之际，官兵们不约而同地想到了依靠党组织。根据官兵们的要求，8名党员聚到一起，开了一个紧急党员会，成立了临时党支部，推举团参谋长朱永和为支部书记，组织股长刘启才、保卫干事杨想亮为副书记，两名连长，两名参谋为支委。临时党支部认真分析了眼前的形势，确定了在失去上级指示的情况下的工作方案，成立了在临时党支部领导下指挥、宣传、群工、内部动员、救护等工作小组，积极开展工作。共产党员，团参谋长朱永和头部，腰部多处被石头击伤，他忍着疼痛，召开支委会，分析形势，研究行动方案，整整两天没合眼。共产党员、组织干事王黎行进中头部被大石击成重伤，至天坛公园时已瞳孔放大，生命垂危，经救护组苦口婆心做工作，在群众中找来医生抢救，才脱离了生命危险。他醒来后第一件事就是拿起喇叭做宣传。他对让他休息的朱参谋长说，我是宣传员，现在正是发挥我作用的时候，我怎么能躺下。他们的行为感动了一些群众主动前来护卫解放军，一位名叫潘根的青年工人领着他们上公园联系，终于使公园打开了大门，让部队进入公园，摆脱了冲击、挨打的险境。共产党员、组织股长刘启才，忍着难熬的饥渴，把背带的水和干粮让给战士们吃。在公园被围困的两天时间里，临时党支部成了36名被围困官兵的主心骨。
    官兵们从临时党支部和党员们的身上汲取了精神力量，大家团结一致，坚持不懈地开展工作。经过两天的艰苦工作，在部队的接应下，他们终于突破了围困，胜利回归大部队。
