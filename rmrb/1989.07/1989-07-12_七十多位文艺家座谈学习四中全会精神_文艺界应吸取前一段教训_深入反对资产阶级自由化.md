Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 12th.

The Yan'an Literary and Art Circle, the Marxist Literary Theory Research Institute, and the editorial boards of "Literary Theory and Criticism" and "Works and Controversy" held a symposium on July 11th and 12th, inviting literary and art figures in Beijing to discuss how to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee and combat bourgeois liberalization. Over 70 artists participated in the symposium.

Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, Song Renqiong, visited the meeting today and spoke. He said, "The Yan'an spirit and the spirit of hard struggle should be upheld for a hundred years. The more we reform and open up, the more we need to strive for hard work. How do we educate the youth today? Do we arm them with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, or do we educate them with patriotism, socialism, and communism, or do we allow bourgeois liberalization to corrupt them? This is a matter of life and death for socialist China, and it is also a major issue for the literary and art community." Song Renqiong hopes that literary and art workers will create more healthy and beneficial works and make more contributions to the education of the youth.

The participants reviewed the period when bourgeois liberalization spread in the literary and art community. Especially, the midway failure of the anti-spiritual pollution campaign in 1983 and the anti-bourgeois liberalization struggle in 1987 greatly emboldened some people to promote bourgeois liberalization, making the literary and art community a major battleground for bourgeois liberalization. The TV series "Heshang" was produced in this context. This work denies national cultural traditions, distorts the history of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction, and advocates for wholesale Westernization, playing a prominent role in confusing national thoughts.

Why did the bourgeois liberalization trend become more intense in the literary and art community? This is inseparable from the protection, encouragement, and support of some leaders in the Party. The participants pointed out that Zhao Ziyang was the biggest protector of bourgeois liberalization in the literary and art community. Zhao Ziyang repeatedly emphasized that the Party should "interfere less and intervene less" in literature and art, which means abolishing the Party's leadership in literary and art work. The speaker continued, "The so-called 'interfere less and intervene less' is very hypocritical. For those who promote bourgeois liberalization, Zhao Ziyang asks people to interfere less and not to criticize. For those who adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and dare to fight against wrong tendencies, Zhao Ziyang has repeatedly intervened arbitrarily, suppressing, striking, slandering, and defaming them. Summarizing historical experience: leadership is key. To ensure that literature and art reform and innovate in a socialist direction, we must first strengthen the leadership teams at all levels in literature and art. Relying on those who are incompatible with the Four Cardinal Principles to implement the Party's literary and art policies can only be counterproductive. This has been proven by numerous facts."

Some participants pointed out that due to the mistakes of Zhao Ziyang and others, the literary and art community has seen a reversal of right and wrong. Those who promote bourgeois liberalization are regarded as heroes of reform and opening up, while those who adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles are labeled as conservative and rigid. The opposition between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization is portrayed as the opposition between conservatism and reform and opening up. Some people and events have been wrongly treated. In response to this situation, we should carefully distinguish right from wrong and draw profound lessons.

The participants had a heated discussion on the anti-corruption issue, unanimously agreeing that the literary and art community should contribute to the national anti-corruption campaign and also seriously address the corruption within itself. The proliferation of "erotic literature," the prevalence of "performing outside of one's official duties," the deterioration of ideological trends, and the frequent occurrence of lawless and disorderly behavior all indicate that the corruption in the literary and art community is shocking. Some participants pointed out that bourgeois liberalization is one of the ideological roots of corruption. Some people advocate for money worship, sexual liberation, anti-rationalism, anti-morality, and unscrupulous competition. These are not directly contributing to the corruption? Liu Xiaobo openly shouted that the driving force of literature is money and lust. It is clear that corruption and bourgeois liberalization are closely linked. We should closely combine adhering to the socialist direction with encouraging artistic innovation and promoting a hundred schools of thought contending.

Some participants suggested launching a new literary and art rectification movement: studying Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the Party's basic line, criticizing bourgeois liberalization, suppressing evil and promoting good, and significantly improving the ideological and moral level of literary and art workers.

    七十多位文艺家座谈学习四中全会精神
    文艺界应吸取前一段教训  深入反对资产阶级自由化
    新华社北京7月12日电　延安文艺学会、马克思主义文艺理论研究所、《文艺理论与批评》和《作品与争鸣》编辑部，7月11日和12日邀请在京文艺界人士举行座谈会，学习十三届四中全会公报和邓小平同志重要讲话，就如何在文艺领域贯彻四中全会精神，反对资产阶级自由化问题交换意见。70余位文艺家参加了座谈。
    中顾委副主任宋任穷今天到会看望大家并讲了话。他说，延安精神、艰苦奋斗的精神，一百年都要讲。越是改革开放，越要艰苦创业。今天我们如何教育青年？是用马列主义、毛泽东思想去武装他们，是用爱国主义、社会主义和共产主义思想去教育他们，还是听任资产阶级自由化思想去腐蚀他们？这是关系到社会主义中国的生死存亡的大事，当然这也是文艺界的大事。宋任穷希望广大的文艺工作者创作出更多健康有益的作品，在青年的教育工作中多作贡献。
    与会同志回顾了一个时期以来资产阶级自由化思潮在文艺领域发展泛滥的过程。特别是1983年清除精神污染、1987年反对资产阶级自由化斗争的中途夭折，极大地助长了一些人搞资产阶级自由化的气焰，以至近几年文艺界成为资产阶级自由化的重灾区。电视片《河殇》就产生于文艺界。这部作品否定民族文化传统，丑化中国革命和社会主义建设的历史，鼓吹全盘西化，在搞乱全国思想中起了突出的作用。
    为什么资产阶级自由化思潮在文艺界愈演愈烈？这和党的领导层中一些人的庇护、怂恿、支持是分不开的。与会者指出，赵紫阳同志是文艺界资产阶级自由化思潮最大的保护伞。赵紫阳一再强调，党对文艺要“少干预、少介入”，这意味着取消党对文艺工作的领导。发言者继续指出，所谓“少干预、少介入”，是十分虚伪的。对于搞资产阶级自由化，赵紫阳同志要求人们少干预，不要去批评。对于坚持四项基本原则、敢于同错误倾向进行斗争的同志，赵紫阳同志则多次蛮横地进行干预，使他们受到压制、打击、污蔑、中伤。总结历史经验：领导是关键。为保障文艺沿着社会主义方向改革创新，首先要健全文艺各级领导班子。信用和依靠那些对四项基本原则格格不入的人来贯彻党的文艺方针，只能是南辕北辙。这是为无数事实所证明了的。
    有同志指出，由于赵紫阳等同志的错误，造成了文艺界的是非颠倒。搞资产阶级自由化的人被当成坚持改革开放的功臣，而坚持四项基本原则的人则被说成保守僵化，四项基本原则和资产阶级自由化的对立，被说成是保守僵化和改革开放的对立，一些人和事受到错误的处置。针对这种状况，应当认真地分清是非，吸取深刻的教训。
    与会同志就反腐败问题进行了热烈的讨论，一致认为文艺界应当为全国的反腐败斗争贡献力量，同时也要认真地克服本身存在的腐败现象。“性文学”的泛滥、“走穴”的盛行、思想风气的败坏、违法乱纪现象的频繁出现等等，都说明了文艺界的腐败现象也是令人触目惊心的。有同志指出，资产阶级自由化思想是腐败现象的思想根源之一。一些人宣扬金钱拜物教，宣扬性解放，宣扬反理性、反道德，宣扬不择手段的自由竞争，这些难道不是直接给腐败现象推波助澜吗？刘晓波就公开叫嚷，文艺的动力就是金钱和肉欲。可见腐败现象和资产阶级自由化思潮是密切相联的。应当把坚持社会主义方向和鼓励艺术创新、开展百家争鸣紧密地结合起来。
    有的与会同志建议进行一次新的文艺整风：学习马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想、学习党的基本路线，批判资产阶级自由化，打击邪气树立正气，使文艺工作者的思想道德水平有一个显著的提高。
