The Arctic has been polluted. The contemporary world faces severe environmental pollution, even in the remote and uninhabited Arctic. Canadian scholars examined skin and liver samples from 140 polar bears and found them containing many toxic substances. Similar substances were also found in seals and fish. Scholars believe these pollutants originate from continents thousands of kilometers away.

The Mississippi River is facing disaster. An American institution, after two years of investigation, concluded that from an ecological perspective, the Mississippi River is on the brink of disaster. If ship navigation is not restricted and numerous dams are not constructed, within fifty years, many of its tributaries and small bays will turn into marshes. To save this crucial waterway, relevant departments have proposed building thirteen hydroelectric projects.

Seaweed plagues the North Sea and Baltic Sea. In the Kattegat, Skagerrak, and Great Belt straits, there is a continuous growth of seaweed stretching for several kilometers. This rapidly growing seaweed, driven by tides and winds, releases toxic substances that harm fish and other marine life. Experts are at a loss for how to address this ecological disaster in the eastern North Sea. They can only determine the scale of the disaster and its causes, which are the dumping of large amounts of industrial and agricultural waste by countries along the North Sea and Baltic Sea. Currently, these seaweeds are spreading and advancing towards the Baltic Sea.

The Panama River is becoming shallower. Over the past forty years, Panama's forests have decreased by one-third, and the rivers supplying water to reservoirs and the canal are gradually becoming shallower. In the past eight years, the amount of freshwater flowing into the canal has decreased by five percent. The Panama Canal's capacity has been reduced, preventing ships with deep drafts from passing through. Scholars predict that if this situation continues, by the year 2000, the Panama Canal's capacity will be reduced by forty percent.

Terrible toxic fog. Up until now, acid rain has been considered the culprit behind the destruction of forests. Recently, American scholars discovered a toxic fog over some farms in Maryland and California. This fog contains chemical substances several thousand times more concentrated than previously thought, including large amounts of pesticides and industrial waste, particularly byproducts from burning plastic. Scholars believe this toxic fog is the true culprit behind the destruction of forests.

Harmful acid clouds. American scholars studying clouds from Alaska to the Puerto Rico islands found that the acid content in the water is three to seven times higher than in rainwater. The clouds over Mount Mohehnke have an acid content higher than vinegar. In high mountain areas, clouds pose a greater threat to agricultural land and forests than acid rain.

    环境污染点滴
    北极已遭污染 当今世界环境污染十分严重，连渺无人烟的北极也在劫难逃。加拿大学者检验了一百四十只白熊的皮肤与肝脏标本，发现里面含有许多有毒物质，在海豹和鱼类体内也发现同样的物质。学者们认为，这些污染物来自几千公里外的大陆。
    密西西比河面临灾难 美国一家专门机构经过两年的考察得出结论：从生态观点来看，密西西比河已面临灾难。如果不限制船舶航行，不建造许多拦河坝，五十年内，它的诸多支流与小河湾将变成沼泽。为拯救这条作为交通枢纽的河流，有关部门已建议修建十三个水力工程。
    北海、波罗的海海草成患 在卡特加特、斯卡格洛克、大贝尔特海峡，生长着一种连绵数公里的海草“云”。这种生长极快的细草在潮流和风的作用下移动，它们分泌出的有毒物质使鱼和其他海洋生物遭灾。专家们对北海东部出现的这场生态灾难束手无策，他们只能确定灾难的规模和导致这场灾难的原因，即北海、波罗的海沿岸国向海中倾倒大量工农业废物。目前，这些海草正滋长蔓延，涌向波罗的海。
    巴拿马河变浅 近四十年来，巴拿马共和国森林减少了三分之一，供应水库和运河水的河流逐渐变浅，近八年来，流入运河的淡水量减少了百分之五。巴拿马运河的容纳能力降低，吃水量较大的船只不能通过。学者们预计，如果这种状况持续下去，到二○○○年，巴拿马运河的容纳能力将降低百分之四十。
    可怕的毒雾 迄今为止，酸雨一直被认为是毁灭森林的肇事者。前不久，美国学者在马里兰州和加利福尼亚州的一些农场上空发现一种毒雾，它所含的化学物质比以前认为的多几千倍，其中有大量杀虫剂与工业垃圾，尤其是塑料燃烧的副产物。学者们认为，这种毒雾是毁灭森林的元凶。
    有害的酸云 美国学者在研究从阿拉斯加到波多黎各群岛上空的云雾发现，其水分中含酸量比雨水高三至七倍，莫赫恩克山上的云雾含酸量高于食醋。在高山地区，云雾对农业耕地和森林的危害甚于酸雨。
