The total income of China's rural economy has for the first time surpassed 100 billion yuan. This achievement is a result of the vitality injected into the rural economy by household management and the tremendous fruits of a decade of reform.

Statistics from the Economic Management Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture show that in 1988, the growth rate of China's rural economy total income was one of the highest in recent years. Excluding Tibet, according to incomplete statistics from 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, the total income of China's rural economy (including county and township-level enterprises) from agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, industry, transportation, construction, commerce and catering, and services reached 1046.76 billion yuan, an increase of 31% over 1987. Notably, household management has become the primary component of rural economic income, amounting to 600.81 billion yuan, which accounts for 57.4% of the total rural economic income nationwide.

The main reasons for the rapid growth of China's rural economy total income are as follows: adjusting the rural industrial structure and rapidly developing the secondary and tertiary industries. In 1988, the income from China's rural secondary and tertiary industries reached 567.62 billion yuan, an increase of 184.62 billion yuan over the previous year, accounting for 58.2% of the total increase in rural economic income for the year. Among the non-agricultural industries, various regions mainly developed rural industries, with the increase in their income accounting for 46.3% of the total increase in rural economic income.

Additionally, the purchase and market prices of major agricultural products have been raised. In 1988, due to the appropriate increase in the prices of agricultural products, the income from planting increased by 15.1% over the previous year, with the income from grain crops increasing by 11.8%. It is estimated that nationwide, grain crops increased income by 10.26 billion yuan due to price adjustments, with an average increase of about 12 yuan per farmer.

    农村经济长足发展年总收入突破万亿
    新华社北京7月1日电（记者余富棠）我国农村经济年总收入首次突破万亿元大关。这是家庭经营给农村经济增添了活力，是10年改革带来的巨大成果。
    农业部经济管理总站提供的资料表明，1988年我国农村经济总收入的增长幅度，是近几年增长幅度较大的一年。除西藏外，据29个省、直辖市、自治区的不完全统计，全国的种植业、林业、牧业、副业、渔业、工业、交通运输业、建筑业、商业饮食业、服务业等农村经济的年总收入（含乡村两级企业），共计达10467.6亿元，比1987年增长31％。引人注目的是，农户家庭经营成为农村经济收入的主要成份，达6008.1亿元，占全国农村经济总收入的57.4％。
    我国农村经济总收入增长较快的主要原因是：调整农村产业结构，非农产业得到迅速发展。1988年，我国农村二、三产业的收入达5676.2亿元，比上年增加1846.2亿元，占全国农村经济当年总收入增加额的58.2％。在非农产业中，各地主要发展了农村工业，其收入的增加额已占全国农村经济总收入增加额的46.3％。
    其次是提高了主要农产品的收购价格和市场价格。1988年，由于适当地提高了农产品的价格，使种植业的收入比上年增长15.1％，其中粮食作物收入增长11.8％。据匡算，全国粮食作物因调价比上年增收102.6亿元，平均每个农民增收12元左右。
