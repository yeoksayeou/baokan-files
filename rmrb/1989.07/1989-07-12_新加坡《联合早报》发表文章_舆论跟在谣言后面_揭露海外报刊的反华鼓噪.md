The Singaporean newspaper *Lianhe Zaobao* has published articles in its "Reader's Forum" column, exposing and criticizing the anti-China propaganda launched by some overseas publications following the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing.

On June 14, the column published an article titled "Opinions Follow Rumors," which stated: "As soon as the Tiananmen incident occurred, the emotional overseas public opinion directed its criticism at the Chinese leadership, and it was one-sided. There was only emotional abuse, no rational analysis. Everyone was fanning the flames, with no one trying to calm things down. Thus, it fueled the students' arrogance."

"The Chinese leadership believes: this was an unavoidable action to maintain public order, a struggle against counter-revolutionaries. The one-sided public opinion believes this was a 'bloody suppression' of the democratic movement. It was a 'massacre,' Beijing was a 'city of slaughter'... In fact, these abuses are exaggerated, some are completely groundless."

"In fact, the public opinion from the beginning has been deceived by rumors, always following behind them; and those spreading the rumors hoped China would be in chaos, the more chaotic the better."

On June 19, the column published another article titled "Hoping China Continues Economic and Political Reforms," which agreed with the previous article and provided further analysis. The article said, "Chinese students took advantage of the mourning for Hu Yaobang to hold demonstrations and marches, demanding various reforms from the government, such as eliminating corrupt officials, and demanding democracy and freedom, all of which were patriotic expressions with good intentions and are commendable."

"But as the situation developed, students from various provinces responded and joined in, later occupying Tiananmen Square as a base, calling for workers to go on strike and join the demonstrations, causing traffic disruptions and production stoppages in cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Many unemployed and criminal elements joined in, causing Beijing's public order and social stability to fall into chaos for a time."

The article pointed out, "From the beginning of the student movement, the United States, which has always been meddlesome, quickly got involved, not only providing continuous support but also urging the Chinese government to seriously handle the student movement issue." Subsequently, "the U.S. government immediately announced a ban on selling weapons and transferring technology to China." The article also said, "Some news agencies continuously fabricated and reported news from China, such as 300,000 troops occupying Beijing, civil war breaking out at any moment, and China being in a state of chaos with no one in charge, etc. What are their intentions?"

"The confusion is that local mass media, when reporting and commenting on this incident, always directed their criticism at the Chinese government, exaggerating the Tiananmen incident, and condemning. From that time on, almost every day, one could read news unfavorable to China's situation. The sources of the news, apart from Western news agencies, were magazines and commentaries from Hong Kong and Taiwan. What benefits did this bring except to stir up unrest among the local Chinese community?"

The article concluded, "As a Chinese person living in Southeast Asia, although we have no direct relationship with China, China's turmoil somewhat affects the mood of overseas Chinese. China's stability and strength also make us overseas Chinese proud. We hope that after the Tiananmen incident, China can quickly recover and continue economic and political reforms with open and enlightened policies."

### 新加坡《联合早报》发表文章  舆论跟在谣言后面  揭露海外报刊的反华鼓噪

    新加坡《联合早报》发表文章
    舆论跟在谣言后面
    揭露海外报刊的反华鼓噪
    本报讯　新加坡《联合早报》在《读者话题》专栏连续发表文章，对北京平息反革命暴乱以来海外一些报刊掀起的反华鼓噪，进行了揭露与批评。
    6月14日，该专栏发表《舆论跟在谣言后面》一文写道：“天安门事件发生伊始，中国国外的情绪化舆论就把矛头指向中国领导，并且是一面倒。只有感性的谩骂，没有理性的分析。一窝蜂煽风点火，没有劝解。“于是，助长了学生的气焰。”
    “中国领导认为：这是一次无可避免的维护法纪行动，是对反革命的斗争。一面倒的舆论认为，这是一次对民主运动的‘血腥镇压’。是‘大屠杀’，北京是‘屠城’……其实这些谩骂是言过其实的，有些是毫无根据的。
    “其实这一次的舆论从开始便被谣言愚弄了，一直跟在谣言的后头；而散布谣言的人惟恐中国不乱，越乱越好。”
    6月19日，该栏又发表《盼中国继续进行经政改革》一文，对上述文章表示赞同，并作进一步分析。文章说，“中国学生趁追悼胡耀邦而举行游行示威，要求政府进行各种改革，如肃清贪官污吏，要求民主自由等，动机都十分良好，是无可厚非的爱国表现。
    “但局势发展下去，各省学生的响应及加入，后来更占据天安门广场作为基地，号召工人罢工参与示威，使北京、上海等城市交通受阻，生产停顿，许多无业流氓，不良分子的掺入，使北京的治安、社会秩序一时陷入混乱。”
    文章指出，“而在学潮展开以来，一向好管闲事的美国，忙不迭地插上一手，除不断声援外，还促中国政府认真处理学潮问题。”随后，“美国政府马上宣布禁止售卖武器及转移科技给中国”。文章还说，“一些通讯社不断制造及报道中国方面的新闻，如30万军队盘踞北京，内战随时爆发，中国不知谁在领导等等，使外人以为中国正处在一个极为动乱的无政府状态中，其居心何在？
    “令人感到迷惑的是，本地大众传播媒体在报道及评述该项事件时，矛头总是对准中国政府，对天安门事件大事渲染，谴责。”“从那时候起，几乎天天都可以读到不利中国局势的新闻，新闻的来源除西方通讯社外，就是香港、台湾的杂志评论。其结果除了掀起本地华人社会的不安外，又有什么益处呢？”
    文章最后说，“作为一个处身在东南亚的华人，和中国虽没有直接关系，但中国的动乱，多少影响了海外华人的心境，中国的安定和强大，也多少使我们海外华人自豪的。愿天安门事件后，中国能迅速回复过来，以开放、开明的政策进行经济、政治上的改革”。
