    The Four-Party Round Table Conference on Cambodia to Resume
    Focus on Discussing the Issue of Four-Party Delegation

    Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 26th. Correspondents Zhang Qihua and Lü Wangda report: Prince Sihanouk held a press conference this morning at his hotel, announcing that the suspended four-party round table conference will resume on the morning of the 27th.

    Sihanouk said that after the round table conference deadlocked yesterday morning, French foreign ministry officials consulted with the Cambodian parties in the afternoon and decided to continue the four-party round table conference at the Château de la Celle-Saint-Cloud. The agenda of the conference will seek a solution acceptable to all parties on the urgent issue of Cambodia's seat and delegation at the Paris International Conference. It is understood that the resistance organizations believe that, strictly speaking, the Hun Sen regime can only be attached to the Vietnamese delegation. The three-party leaders proposed the formation of a four-party joint delegation, named "Cambodia," but were rejected by Hun Sen. Hun Sen designated his delegation as the national delegation, proposing two delegations, namely the Phnom Penh regime and Sihanouk, and refused to allow the three-party resistance organizations to participate in the international conference together.

    Prince Sihanouk emphasized that the main contradiction among the four parties in Cambodia is between the resistance movement and the Hun Sen regime in Phnom Penh. In essence, it is a contradiction between the Cambodian people and the Vietnamese, because Hun Sen represents the Vietnamese colonialists.

    柬埔寨四方圆桌会议将复会
    集中讨论四方组团问题
    本报巴黎7月26日电　记者张启华、吕网大报道：西哈努克亲王今天上午在他下榻的旅馆举行记者招待会，宣布中断了的四方圆桌会议将于27日上午复会。
    西哈努克说，昨天上午的圆桌会议陷入僵局后，下午，法国外交部官员与柬埔寨各方磋商后，决定四方圆桌会议继续在拉塞勒—圣克卢镇城堡举行，会议的议题将就参加巴黎国际会议的柬埔寨席位和组团这一紧迫的问题寻找各方可以接受的方案。据悉，抵抗组织认为，严格说来洪森政权只能依附于越南代表团；三方领导人建议组成四方联合代表团，名称为“柬埔寨”，但遭洪森拒绝。洪森自封他的代表团为国家代表团，提出两个代表团，即金边政权和西哈努克，拒绝三方抵抗组织一起参加国际会议。
    西哈努克亲王强调说，柬埔寨四方之间矛盾，主要是抵抗运动与金边洪森政权之间的矛盾，实质上是柬埔寨人与越南人之间的矛盾，因为洪森代表的是越南殖民主义者。
