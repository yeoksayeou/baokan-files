Last year, the farmers in Weishan Island Township of our county used net cages to raise fish, covering an area of 610 mu. However, by this year, a quarter of the fish farmers in the entire township have stopped raising fish. The reason is that some lawless elements frequently damage the fish farmers' net cages, releasing large quantities of fish. In July of last year, a villager from Lv Meng Village had his fish-raising net cage cut, resulting in a loss of 100,000 yuan.

    不法分子割网破坏  养鱼农户含泪停产
    去年，我县微山岛乡的农民用网箱养鱼，面积达六百一十亩。可是，到了今年全乡已有四分之一的养鱼户不再养鱼。原因是一些不法分子经常破坏养鱼户的网箱，大批鱼被放掉。去年七月，吕蒙村一村民养鱼网箱被割，损失万元。
