A batch of agricultural enterprises dubbed "smokeless factories" have emerged in Wuchang County, Hubei Province. The county has established 1,400 such enterprises.

Situated on the outskirts of Wuhan City, Wuchang County has seen rapid development in its township enterprises in recent years. However, it has also faced challenges such as shortages of raw materials, funding, and sales channels. The county committee drew inspiration from the experiences of some townships that achieved prosperity through agricultural development. In 1986, it made a decision to encourage farmers to invest in barren mountains, waters, and wastelands, establishing forest farms, tea plantations, fisheries, orchards, and livestock farms. These smokeless and pollution-free agricultural enterprises were immediately favored by the farmers.

Farmers accumulate wealth through their own labor, pool resources to invest in stocks, and do not need to build factories or purchase equipment. Surplus labor does not need to move to the city, and even the mud on their feet does not need to be washed off; they can step out of the rice fields and enter resource development. Farmer Li Jiyang developed 68 acres of barren land to plant Chinese fir trees, earning an additional 14,000 yuan annually. His success inspired his fellow villagers, and the area of Chinese fir plantations in his township reached 9,000 acres.

    立足乡村　另辟蹊径
    武昌县农业企业兴起
    本报武汉电　记者龚达发报道：一批被称为“无烟工厂”的农业企业，在湖北省武昌县兴起。全县已办起1400家这类企业。
    位于武汉市郊的武昌县，近几年乡镇企业发展迅速，却也为原料、资金、销路等难题所困扰。县委从一些乡镇搞农业开发致富的经验中得到启示，1986年作出决策，鼓励农民向荒山、荒水、荒滩投资，兴办林场、茶场、渔场、果园、畜牧场。这些无烟、无污染的农业企业一出现就受到农民的青睐。农民们靠自己的劳动积累，集资入股，不要建厂房、买设备，富余劳动力不需要进城，甚至不需要洗去脚上的泥巴，走出稻田就可转入资源开发。农民李继旺开发68亩荒山植杉树，每年可增值1.4万元。他的成功带动了乡亲，他所在乡植杉面积达到9000亩。
