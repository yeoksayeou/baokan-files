The full name of the "Gaozi Lian" is the "Beijing College Student Autonomous Federation." In the entire process of the disturbances, turmoil, and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in Beijing, "Gaozi Lian" played a particularly important role. Due to the complexity of the struggle, many well-intentioned people do not fully understand the true nature of "Gaozi Lian." Now, as the counter-revolutionary riots have been suppressed and the truth about how a few individuals and various forces manufactured, manipulated, and exploited the disturbances is gradually being revealed, the counter-revolutionary true face of "Gaozi Lian" is also gradually being exposed to the world.

	I. The Background and Organizational Structure of "Gaozi Lian"

	Since the second half of last year, some people in certain colleges and universities have begun organized activities, spreading various bourgeois liberalization views among students. By the end of last year, these people started creating public opinion, intending to use the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, and the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation as opportunities to make a big move. By February and March of this year, they became even more active, frequently organizing various salons, forums, and signature drives, claiming to launch a democratic movement on May Fourth, with the agenda being political pluralism and economic privatization. On April 15, Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away, and they saw this as an excellent opportunity to incite public sentiment, so they moved up their planned actions from May Fourth.

	Starting in May of last year, someone organized the "Democracy Salon." They held activities every week, inviting prominent figures of bourgeois liberalization like Fang Lizhi to propagate their ideas. On April 19 of this year, under the leadership of Wang Dan, the 16th meeting of the "Democracy Salon" at Peking University established the "Peking University United Student Association Preparatory Committee" to lead their so-called student movement. This "Preparatory Committee" consisted of seven people: Ding Xiaoping, Wang Dan, Yang Tao, Yang Dantao, Xiong Yan, Feng Congde, and Chang Jin. "Gaozi Lian" developed from this foundation.

	As the disturbances evolved into turmoil, they believed the time to attack the Party and the government had ripened. Based on the lessons of past failures, they hurriedly established their own organizational system. On April 20, under the leadership of Ding Xiaoping, they convened a meeting of over 300 students from various schools to announce the establishment of the "Beijing College Student Federation," directly organizing the April 22 mass student petition at Tiananmen Square. On April 23, "representatives" from 21 schools met at the Summer Palace to establish the precursor to "Gaozi Lian," the "Beijing College Temporary Committee," also known as the Beijing College Temporary Student Federation. Zhou Yongjun from the College of Political Science and Law was elected as the first chairman, with members including Wang Dan, Wu'erkaixi, Ma Shaofang, and Zang Kai. On April 28, the "Temporary Student Federation" met at the College of Political Science and Law, removed Zhou Yongjun from his position, and appointed Wu'erkaixi as the new chairman. Simultaneously, the "Temporary Student Federation" was renamed the "Beijing College Student Autonomous Federation," marking the official establishment of "Gaozi Lian."

	After its establishment, "Gaozi Lian" had two notable characteristics: frequent personnel changes but consistent core members; and frequent name changes and numerous subsidiary organizations. For example, on May 2, the "Negotiation Delegation" was established, on May 13, the "Hunger Strike Group" was formed, on May 22, the "Tiananmen Square Temporary Command Center" was set up, and on May 26, it was renamed the "Defense of Tiananmen Square Command Center." The reasons for these characteristics are mainly: first, the so-called "struggle needs." In reality, they did this to better conceal themselves. However, core members like Wang Dan, Wu'erkaixi, Chai Ling, Feng Congde, and Guo Haifeng remained active in various organizations; second, there were frequent disagreements within "Gaozi Lian," leading to internal strife over power and interests, causing the organization to split repeatedly.

	II. The True Face of "Gaozi Lian"

	From its inception to its establishment and all subsequent activities, "Gaozi Lian" had a clear agenda. Its fundamental goal was to overthrow the Communist Party's leadership, overthrow the socialist system, and completely abolish the Four Cardinal Principles. Its slogans and specific goals were adjusted according to the evolving situation. At the beginning of the turmoil, they relentlessly attacked the Party, the government, and national leaders, demanding the negation of the anti-bourgeois liberalization campaign and the campaign to eliminate spiritual pollution, and calling for the rehabilitation of prominent figures of bourgeois liberalization. During the mid-phase of the turmoil, in the negotiation process, they demanded that the central government completely negate the April 26 editorial, acknowledge this as a patriotic democratic movement, and recognize "Gaozi Lian" as a legal organization. In the late phase of the turmoil, they openly called for the overthrow of [specific leaders], openly inciting the overthrow of the government. Their ultimate goal, as stated by Wang Dan in an article published on May 17 in the American "World Journal," was to "establish a Westernized political system," implement private ownership in the economy, and a multi-party system in politics.

	"Gaozi Lian" was also the direct organizer of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. From its establishment, it directly participated in creating the turmoil. It organized the April 22 illegal petition at Tiananmen Square, started the citywide college strike on April 24, and organized the May 4 and subsequent marches. Especially taking advantage of Gorbachev's visit to China, a major state event, they organized the hunger strike starting on May 13, using the lives of fellow students as political leverage to pressure the Party and the government. Starting on May 19, "Gaozi Lian" learned through backdoor channels that the capital would implement martial law, spreading numerous rumors. They said the troops entering the city were there to suppress the students, disclosing the troop numbers and march routes, inciting students and citizens to block military vehicles and attack the troops. On May 25, "Gaozi Lian" held a meeting, drafting two plans to launch the most intense attack on the government. They sent out five propaganda teams to various parts of the country to coordinate nationwide actions. On June 2, they held a so-called "trophy exhibition" at the Monument to the People's Heroes, mainly displaying illegally seized military items. Simultaneously, in the "Gaozi Lian" broadcasts on the square, they taught people how to make and use Molotov cocktails. They held a joint meeting with the "Workers' Autonomous Federation," planning nationwide looting, arson, and establishing assassination squads, becoming the direct organizers of the riots.

	"Gaozi Lian" was also a treasonous organization colluding with foreign forces, modern-day traitors. It maintained close ties with foreign reactionary forces, directly receiving their funding. According to their own estimates, maintaining activities on the square required at least 100,000 yuan per day. Such a large sum could not be collected through street donations. One of their deputy commanders claimed they had 10 million yuan in funds, including 3 million yuan in cash. Foreign funds came from the United States, France, and others. In Hong Kong, someone booked rooms at the Beijing Hotel to provide funds to the square at any time. When the "Gaozi Lian" leaders fled, each carried tens of thousands to tens of millions of yuan. "Gaozi Lian" also, through foreign forces, arranged passports for its 40 core members, preparing to flee abroad if the situation worsened. They provided large amounts of state secrets and information to Western media, using foreign public opinion to deceive and incite domestic crowds.

	"Gaozi Lian" shouted "democracy and freedom" on the surface but was a gang of political hooligans in reality. Their logic was "a lie repeated a hundred times becomes the truth." They created numerous rumors to incite the emotions of the masses and students, achieving their goal of manipulating the turmoil. After Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing, they said Yaobang was poisoned, using this to stir up the disturbances. Later, they fabricated the rumors of the "Beijing Normal University female student being run over by a police car" and the "April 20 New China Gate massacre," deceiving students who were unaware of the truth, organizing the April 21 evening march. On April 22, they created the lie that Premier Li Peng agreed to meet with the students, escalating the students' antagonism towards the government. On May 13, they used the lie that the government refused to negotiate to incite students to hunger strike, claiming it would only be a 30-hour limited hunger strike. In reality, once students entered the hunger strike circle, they were not allowed to leave, while the organizers feasted. After May 20, for four consecutive days, they created various rumors on the square about the military taking repressive actions, calling on the masses to defend the square, further creating conflicts between the masses and the government. On the evening of June 2, they turned a random traffic accident where three civilians unfortunately lost their lives into a story of "democratic fighters" dying while blocking military vehicles, using this as an excuse to instigate the counter-revolutionary riots. On June 4, they spread the rumor of "the military massacring Tiananmen Square, thousands dead," inciting the masses to oppose the government. Therefore, from the inception of the disturbances to their escalation into turmoil and finally the counter-revolutionary riots, "Gaozi Lian" used rumors to deceive the masses, incite public sentiment, achieving their sinister goals.

	From the various performances of "Gaozi Lian," we can see that it is a counter-revolutionary organization established after long-term planning, with clear political agendas and goals. They used creating rumors as their main means of inciting the masses, exploiting the goodwill of the masses, actively participating in creating turmoil and riots using college students as carriers. Their true face will be recognized by more and more people. (Originally published in the July 4, 1989 issue of the Beijing Youth Daily)

    请看“北京高校自治联合会”的真面目
    严实
    “高自联”的全称是“北京高校学生自治联合会”。在这次北京发生的学潮、动乱以至反革命暴乱整个过程中，“高自联”始终扮演了一个十分重要的角色。由于斗争的复杂性，许多善良的人们并不很了解“高自联”的真实面目，现在，随着反革命暴乱被平息，随着少数人和各种势力制造、操纵和利用学潮的真相被逐渐揭露，“高自联”的反革命真面目也正在逐渐暴露于世人面前。
    一、“高自联”产生的背景和组织体系
    自去年上半年以来，一些高校中就有些人开始进行了有组织的活动，他们在学生中大肆宣扬各种资产阶级自由化的观点。至去年底开始，这些人又开始制造舆论，要利用今年五四运动70周年、法国大革命200周年和建国40周年时机大干一场。到今年二、三月份，他们更加活跃，不断组织各种沙龙、研讨会、搞征集签名，声言要在五四掀起一场民主运动，其纲领就是在政治上实行多党制、在经济上搞产权私有化。4月15日，胡耀邦同志去世，他们认为这是一个煽动群众情绪的极好机会，便把原计划在五四的行动提前进行。
    自去年5月开始，有人就组织了“民主沙龙”。每周活动一次，邀请搞资产阶级自由化的头面人物如方励之等人宣扬他们的思想。今年4月19日，由王丹主持，在北大“民主沙龙”第16次会议上成立了“北大团结学生会筹委会”，来领导他们所谓的学生运动。这个“筹委会”由7人组成：丁小平、王丹、杨涛、杨丹涛、熊炎、封从德、常劲。“高自联”就是在这个基础上发展起来的。
    随着学潮发展为动乱，他们自认为向党和政府进攻的时机已成熟，基于过去学潮失败的教训，他们迫不及待地要成立自己的组织系统。4月20日，由丁小平主持，召集各校300余名学生开会，宣布成立“北京高校学生联合会”，直接组织了4月22日数万学生在天安门广场的请愿活动。4月23日，21个学校的“代表”在圆明园开会，成立“高自联”前身“北京高校临时委员会”，即北京高校临时学联，选举政法大学周勇军为第一任主席，成员有王丹、吾尔开希、马少芳、臧凯等。4月28日，“临时学联”在政法大学开会，撤销周勇军的主席职务，由吾尔开希接任。同时，“临时学联”改名为“北京高校自治联合会”，“高自联”由此正式成立。
    “高自联”成立以后，有两个比较明显的特点：一是人员变化快，但骨干分子一直没有变；二是名称变化多，衍生组织多。如5月2日成立“对话代表团”，5月13日成立“绝食团”，5月22日成立“天安门广场临时指挥部”，5月26日又改称“保卫天安门广场指挥部”。之所以有这些特点，主要原因一是所谓的“斗争需要”。其实他们这样做是为了更好地掩护自己。但其骨干王丹、吾尔开希、柴玲、封从德、郭海峰等一直活跃在各个组织之中；二是“高自联”内部经常意见分歧，为争权夺利而发生内讧，也使得其组织不断分化。
    二、“高自联”的真实面目
    “高自联”从开始酝酿到成立，以至所有的活动，它的纲领是十分明确的。根本目的就是要推翻共产党领导，推翻社会主义制度，彻底取消四项基本原则。其口号和具体目标根据形势发展不断调整。在动乱开始，他们就拚命攻击党和政府及国家领导人，提出要否定反对资产阶级自由化运动和消除精神污染运动，并为搞资产阶级自由化的头面人物平反。在动乱中期对话过程中，提出要中央彻底否定4.26社论，承认这是一场爱国民主运动，承认“高自联”为合法组织。动乱后期，他们公开提出打倒×××、打倒××，公开鼓动颠覆政府，其最终目的就是王丹5月17日在美国《世界导报》上发表的一篇文章中所表述的那样，“建立西方化的政治体制”，在经济上实行私有制，在政治上实行多党制。
    “高自联”也是策划动乱和反革命暴乱的直接组织者。从它的成立伊始，就直接参与了制造动乱的活动。它组织了4月22日天安门广场的非法请愿，24日开始组织全市高校罢课，组织了5月4日及其以后的各次游行。特别是趁戈尔巴乔夫访华这一重大国事活动之机，组织了5月13日开始的绝食行动，以广大同学的生命为政治砝码，向党和政府施加压力。5月19日开始，“高自联”通过幕后渠道得知首都将实行戒严的部署后，制造了大批谣言。说部队进京是来镇压学生的。公布了戒严部队的番号和进军路线，煽动学生和市民堵截军车、围攻部队。5月25日，“高自联”开会，制定了两套方案，决定用最激烈的方式向政府发起进攻，他们派出了5个宣传团到全国各地串联，在全国搞统一的行动。6月2日，他们在纪念碑前举办了所谓“战利品”展览，主要是违法抢夺的军用物品。同时在广场的“高自联”广播中教人们如何制造和使用燃烧瓶。他们与“工自联”召开联席会，制定了在全国搞打砸抢烧的计划，并准备成立暗杀团，成为制造暴乱的直接组织者。
    “高自联”还是里通外国的卖国组织，是当代的卖国贼汉奸。它一直与外国的反动势力保持密切的联系，直接接受他们的资助。据他们自己估计，要维持广场的活动，每天至少需要10万元，这样庞大的费用只靠街头募捐是不可能收集起来的。他们的一位副总指挥称他们有1000万元经费，其中现金300万元。国外的资金来自于美国、法国等，香港还有人在北京饭店包下房间，专门向广场随时提供各种费用。“高自联”头头最后潜逃时，每人身上都带着数万以至十几万的经费。“高自联”还通过外国势力给它的40名骨干每人办好了一份护照，准备一旦形势不妙就逃往国外。他们还向西方的新闻工具提供了大量的国家机密和消息，再通过国外舆论来欺骗煽动国内群众。
    “高自联”表面高喊民主自由，实际是一个十足的政治流氓团伙。其逻辑就是“谎言重复百遍就是真理”。他们制造了大量的谣言，以此来煽动群众和学生的情绪，以达到操纵动乱的目的。在胡耀邦同志去世后，他们说耀邦是被毒死的，以此挑动学潮。而后，他们又制造了“师大女学生被警车撞死”和“4·20新华门惨案”的谣言，欺骗不明真相的学生，组织了4月21日晚的游行。4月22日又制造了李鹏总理答应接见学生的骗局，加剧了学生与政府的对立情绪。5月13日又以政府拒绝对话的谎言煽动同学绝食，并说只进行30小时有限绝食，实际上只要学生一进入绝食圈子就不允许再退出，而绝食的组织者却大吃大喝。5月20日后，连续4天在广场制造各种军队要采取镇压行动的谣言，号召群众保卫广场，进一步制造群众与政府的矛盾。6月2日晚，又把一起偶然的交通事故中不幸遇难的三位市民说成是民主战士，是拦军车而死的，并以此为借口，策动了反革命暴乱。6月4日，他们又造谣“军队血洗天安门广场，死亡几千人”，挑动群众与政府对抗。所以，从学潮的产生，以至发展成动乱，最后发生反革命暴乱，都是“高自联”通过谣言来欺骗群众，煽动群众情绪，以达到他们不可告人的目的。
    从“高自联”的种种表演我们可以看出，“高自联”是经过长期策划成立的，有明确的政治纲领和目标的反革命组织。他们以制造谣言为煽动群众的主要手段，利用群众的善良愿望，以大学生为载体，积极参与制造了动乱和暴乱，他们的真正面目必将被越来越多的人们所认识。（原载7月4日《北京青年报》）
