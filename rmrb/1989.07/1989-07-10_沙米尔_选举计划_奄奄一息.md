In the 40-year history of the Middle East conflict, numerous "solutions" and "plans" have come and gone like fleeting clouds. The "election plan" proposed by Shamir, which has been in existence for just three months, seems to be meeting its end, another short-lived effort.

This plan was flawed from the start. With 20 clauses, it appeared comprehensive, including both a "temporary agreement" period and negotiations for a "permanent solution." However, it was vague on key issues. At the time, many people doubted whether such a plan could resolve the sharp and complex regional disputes in the Middle East.

The PLO and relevant Arab countries, with the intention of peacefully resolving the Middle East issue, did not entirely reject Shamir's "election plan." They did not oppose the political solution of holding elections for Palestinians in the occupied territories, but they clearly demanded international supervision and guarantees for Israeli withdrawal. International opinion held that the Arab side had made the maximum concessions, agreeing to use the election plan as part of a comprehensive solution to the Middle East problem, but hoping that the Israeli government would clarify the details of the plan...

However, the modified election plan passed by the Likud bloc in Israel on July 5th not only failed to satisfactorily address the Arab side's questions but also significantly retreated from its original position. Shamir repeatedly emphasized that he would not engage in direct negotiations with the PLO, would not allow the establishment of a Palestinian state, and would continue to build Jewish settlements. Even more, Shamir clarified the ambiguous parts of the original plan: residents of East Jerusalem would not be allowed to vote, and elections could not be held until the uprising was quelled. This effectively shut down the Middle East peace process, which had previously shown some hope. It is no wonder that the PLO commented that Shamir had "closed the door to Middle East peace."

The changes to Shamir's "election plan" also caught the U.S. State Department off guard. Initially, the State Department had high hopes for the "election plan," aiming to expand it as the basis for Arab-Israeli negotiations and, at the very least, to use it to temporarily ease the pressure to convene an international conference. However, it was Israel that once again put the White House in an awkward position.

An American high-level official accompanying Secretary of State Baker on his visit to Oman said, "We still need to see if the election plan can make progress." These words were merely meant to comfort themselves, but his next statement drew significant attention from international opinion: "If it fails, the United States may turn to support an international conference in the Middle East." Is this true? International opinion seems reluctant to believe it.

The United States has had many setbacks in the Middle East. The Bush administration has become more cautious, but its first step in the Middle East dance was to bet on the election plan, which may have been another miscalculation?

### 沙米尔“选举计划”奄奄一息

    沙米尔“选举计划”奄奄一息
    本报记者　林皎明
    40载中东争端历史中，多少解决“方案”、“计划”如过眼烟云，一晃而过。问世不过3个月的沙米尔“选举计划”，看来气数已尽，也是个短命鬼。
    这份计划先天不足。20项条款，洋洋大观，既有“暂时协议”期限，又有“永久解决”谈判。但偏偏在关键问题上含糊不清。当时，许多人怀疑，中东如此尖锐复杂的地区争端靠这么一份计划能解决得了吗？
    巴解组织和有关阿拉伯国家出于和平解决中东问题的诚意，没有全部拒绝沙米尔“选举计划”。它们不反对在被占领土进行巴勒斯坦人选举的政治解决形式，同时，明确要求国际监督和以色列撤军的保证。国际舆论认为，阿拉伯一方已经作了最大限度的让步，同意将选举计划作为中东问题全面解决的一部分，但希望以色列政府把计划的细节解释清楚……
    然而，7月5日以色列利库德集团通过的经过修改的选举计划，不但不对阿拉伯一方的质疑作出让人满意的解答，反而从原来的立场上大大地倒退了。沙米尔一再重申，绝不同巴解组织直接谈判，绝不允许建立巴勒斯坦国，继续建立犹太人定居点。更有甚者，沙米尔还将原计划“含糊不清”之处加以澄清：东耶路撒冷居民无权参加选举，起义不平息就不能实施选举。这就把原来还有一线希望的中东和平进程堵死了。难怪巴解组织评价说，沙米尔“把中东和平大门关死”。
    沙米尔“选举计划”的变更，也给美国国务院一个措手不及。想当初，美国国务院对“选举计划”独有所钟，一心指望把它扩展为阿以谈判的基础，至少想暂时用它来减缓召开国际会议的压力。殊不知，恰恰又是以色列，使白宫又一次陷于窘境。
    随国务卿贝克出访阿曼的一位美国高级官员称，“我们还要看选举计划能否取得进展”。这话无非聊以自慰，不过，他的下一句话颇引起国际舆论的关注：“如若不成，美国可能转而支持中东国际会议”。此话当真？国际舆论似乎不敢轻信。
    美国在中东碰钉子的次数实在不少了。布什政府学得谨慎起来，可它在中东跳小步舞的第一步就把宝压在选举计划上，是不是又失算了？
