Xinhua News Agency, Damascus, July 8th.

Lebanon's Muslim Shiite factions, the "Amal" Movement and the "Hezbollah," have agreed to a ceasefire under the mediation of Syria and Iran. The leaders of these two organizations issued a joint statement in Damascus today, pledging to adhere to and implement the agreement they signed six months ago, thereby halting the mutual killings.

Following an expanded meeting with Hezbollah leader Musa Sadr, Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa, and Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, the statement emphasized that all necessary measures will be taken to prevent further armed clashes between the two factions. They also committed to eliminating the root causes of these conflicts and strengthening unity and cooperation between the two sides.

The statement also mentioned that Amal and Hezbollah will establish a joint body to investigate the clashes that occurred over the past week and to severely punish those responsible. Yesterday, the Syrian-backed Amal Movement and the Iranian-backed Hezbollah engaged in nearly six hours of gun battles in West Beirut, resulting in two deaths and 12 injuries. Sporadic fighting continued until early this morning.
