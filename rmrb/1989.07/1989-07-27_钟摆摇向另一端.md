Currently, the prisons in various states of the United States are holding 2,200 death row inmates. According to statistics, among them, there are more than 700 who are either minors or have mental disabilities. Whether these people should be executed has recently become a topic of discussion here.

For a long time, it has been difficult to sentence someone to death in the United States. Three years ago, a young man in his early twenties in Oregon raped a young woman with a gun, then shot and killed her, and robbed her of her belongings. During the final trial, because one member of the jury opposed it, the judge had to sentence him to life imprisonment. At that time, people calculated that if this person lived for another fifty years, his prison life would cost taxpayers about one million dollars. Someone once angrily questioned: Does the law punish criminals and protect the innocent, or is it the opposite?

It is even more difficult to sentence minors and those with mental disabilities to death. The United States has thirteen states that have abolished the death penalty, and fifteen states explicitly prohibit the execution of minors aged eighteen or seventeen and below. The criminal who attempted to assassinate President Reagan in Washington with a handgun, Hinckley, was released by the court on the grounds of "mental illness."

However, "the pendulum is swinging to the other side." With the increasing prevalence of violent crimes in the United States in recent years, the number of juvenile killers is on the rise, and the social demand for severe crackdowns and harsh sentences for criminals is growing stronger. A recent public opinion poll showed that 75% of respondents support the execution of serious criminals, and 57% support the execution of sixteen- and seventeen-year-old juvenile criminals. Some people even loudly proclaim, "Warn the young: the solution to crime is beheading." Meanwhile, the U.S. government has intensified its crackdown on criminal activities. After the murder rate in the capital, Washington, D.C., ranked first in the nation last year, the authorities decided this year to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars to build more prisons to hold criminals; California took the lead in announcing the "Law to Stop and Prevent Street Terrorism," even stipulating that parents who fail to 'reasonably care for, supervise, protect, and control' their children should be sentenced and fined; some states and cities are debating the restoration of the death penalty; President Bush recently demanded the death penalty for those who use firearms and other violent means to kill law enforcement officers...

What is particularly noteworthy is that the U.S. Supreme Court, which holds the power to interpret the law, recently voted 5-4 to pass a ruling: executing certain juvenile criminals and mentally disabled individuals "is constitutional." A decision drafted by Justices Scalia and O'Connor, and supported by the Chief Justice, pointed out that the Constitution's prohibition against "cruel and unusual punishment" does not prevent the execution of sixteen- and seventeen-year-old juvenile criminals or the imposition of the death penalty on mentally disabled individuals. According to this interpretation, many similar criminals in the future may not escape being executed. Although some people believe that the Supreme Court's ruling goes against the principle of "natural rights" in the U.S. Constitution, there are many supporters. A person in charge of a charitable organization in New York said, "These teenagers who commit premeditated murder have reached the age of intellectual maturity and can distinguish right from wrong. They should bear full responsibility." A famous legal figure in Washington believes that the Supreme Court's harsh ruling indicates that "the days of using technicalities to exonerate criminals are over."

    钟摆摇向另一端
    本报记者　仓立德
    目前美国各州监狱共囚禁着二千二百名死刑犯，据统计，他们之中，未成年者或精神障碍者多达七百余名。对这些人该不该执行死刑，近来成了此间人们议论的问题之一。
    长期以来，在美国判处某人死刑相当难。三年前，俄勒冈州一名二十岁出头的青年持枪将一位女郎强奸，然后射杀了她，并劫掠了她的财物。在终审时，只因陪审团中一人反对，法官不得不判他终生监禁。当时人们算过一笔账：如果此人再活五十年，那末其牢中余生要耗掉纳税人大约一百万美元。有人曾气愤地质问：法律到底是惩罚罪犯、保护无辜，还是相反？
    判死刑不易，对未成年犯及精神障碍者判刑则更难。美国有十三个州废除死刑，有十五个州明确禁止处死十八岁或十七岁以下的少年犯。当年在华盛顿用手枪刺杀里根总统的凶犯欣克利，就是以“精神原因”被法庭无罪开释的。
    然而，“钟摆在向另一端摇晃”。随着近年美国暴力犯罪活动日益猖獗，青少年杀人犯不断增多，要求严厉打击、从重判决罪犯的社会舆论亦愈来愈强烈。最近的
  一项民意调查结果显示，赞成处死重犯的人已达到百分之七十五；赞成处死十六七岁少年犯的人已上升到百分之五十七。甚至有人大声疾呼“正告年轻人：解决犯罪的方法便是杀头”。与此同时，美国政府加紧了对犯罪活动的镇压。首都华盛顿去年凶杀率跃居全国第一后，当局今年决定拨款上亿美元大兴监牢以关押犯人；加利福尼亚州率先公布了《制止和预防街头恐怖活动法》，甚至规定要对未能“合理照料、监督、保护及管制”子女的家长判刑并罚款；一些州市正在辩论恢复死刑问题；布什总统不久前要求对那些用枪械等暴力手段杀害执法人员的犯人处于极刑……
    尤为引人注目的是，执掌解释法律大权的美国最高法院数日前以五比四表决通过裁决：处死某些少年犯及智力迟钝者“合乎宪法”。由斯卡利亚、奥康纳两位大法官起草并得到首席大法官支持的一项决定指出，宪法对“残酷及异常刑罚”的禁止既不会妨碍对十六、七岁少年犯执行死刑，也不会阻止对智力迟钝者判处死刑。根据这一解释，许多类似罪犯今后恐怕都难逃被处决的惩罚。尽管有人认为最高法院的裁决有悖于美国宪法的“天赋人权”原则，但支持者为数众多。纽约一位慈善机构负责人说，“这些犯下蓄意凶杀罪行的十几岁的人已达到智力成熟的年纪，能分辨是非。他们应当承担全部后果。”华盛顿一位著名法律界人士认为，最高法院的严厉裁决说明，“利用技术细节使罪犯开脱的日子已一去不复返了”。
