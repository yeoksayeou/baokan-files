Currently, the global oil market is stabilizing, and oil prices are firming up. One of the key reasons is the continuous increase in oil demand in the Western world.

The latest statistics from the International Energy Agency show that after a sharp decline in the early 1980s, oil consumption in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries began to rise in 1984, increasing by an average of 2.5% annually. By the fourth quarter of 1988, the growth in oil demand reached about 5%. In the first quarter of this year, the daily oil demand in OECD countries was 38 million barrels, an increase of 1.6% compared to the same period last year.

According to the Secretary-General of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Subroto, the daily oil demand in Western countries is expected to reach 49.7 million barrels this year, 55 million barrels in 1995, and 58 million barrels by the end of the century.

The United States is the world's largest oil-consuming country. In 1988, its daily demand was 17 million barrels, an increase of 3% compared to 1987. This year's demand is expected to rise by 2%, reaching 17.464 million barrels per day. This is the highest level since 1979.

Japan's oil demand, including crude oil and petroleum products, has been on an upward trend in recent years. According to the fiscal year, it increased by 2% in 1986, 4.7% in 1987, and 7% in 1988.

The increase in oil demand in the Western world has eased the long-standing supply-demand imbalance in the global oil market, shifting it towards a supply-demand balance. Especially since this year, OPEC's actual production has continued to exceed its quota by approximately 1 million barrels per day, but the excess production has been absorbed by the market. This has provided market conditions for OPEC to increase its production quota for the second half of this year from 18.5 million barrels per day in the first half to 19.5 million barrels per day.

The increase in oil demand in the Western world is mainly due to two reasons: low oil prices and the sustained economic growth of Western industrialized countries.

After the "oil price war" in 1986, which caused oil prices to plummet, oil prices have remained unstable, fluctuating but not reaching OPEC's target of $18 per barrel by the beginning of this year. In October last year, oil prices once fell below $10 per barrel. Low oil prices have stimulated the increase in oil demand in Western countries. According to the National Energy Agency, in recent years, oil consumption has increased by 1 million barrels per day annually, partly due to the stimulus of low oil prices.

The sustained economic growth of Western industrialized countries is the main reason for the increase in oil demand. According to a report by the OECD, the average economic growth rate of the 24 member countries in 1988 was 4%, with Japan having the highest growth rate at 5%. Therefore, its oil demand growth was also the highest. According to the British publication "Petroleum Economist," in the first half of the 1988 fiscal year, Japan's oil demand increased by 6.4% compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year, reaching 3.0776 million barrels per day, which was 4.1% higher than planned.

According to the OECD's forecast, the economies of Western industrialized countries are expected to grow by 3.5% this year. Under normal circumstances, the increase in oil demand in these countries is synchronized with their economic growth. It is estimated that the oil demand in these countries will increase by about 3.2% this year.

    西方世界石油需求量上升
    新华社记者　强玉才
    目前，世界石油市场趋于平稳、油价趋于坚挺，重要原因之一是西方世界石油需求量的不断上升。
    国际能源机构最新统计数字表明，经济合作与发展组织（经合组织）国家的石油消费量在80年代初期急剧下降后，从1984年开始回升，每年平均递增2.5％，到1988年第4季度，石油需求量的增长达到5％左右。今年第1季度，经合组织的石油日需求量为3800万桶，比去年同期增加1.6％。
    据石油输出国组织（欧佩克）秘书长苏布罗托估计，西方国家对石油的日需求量今年将达到4970万桶，1995年达到5500万桶，本世纪末达到5800万桶。
    美国是世界石油消费大国，1988年其日均需求量达1700万桶，比1987年增3％，今年的需求量将上升2％，达每天1746.4万桶。这是自1979年以来的最高水平。
    日本的石油需求，包括原油和石油产品，近几年一直呈上升趋势。按财政年度计算，1986年度上升2％，1987年度上升4.7％，1988年度上升7％。
    西方世界石油需求量的上升，缓解了世界石油市场多年存在的供需矛盾，使供需失衡趋向供需平衡。特别是今年以来，欧佩克实际生产量仍每天约超过其定额100万余桶，但超产部分被市场吸收，从而为欧佩克在今年6月份将今年下半年的日产量由上半年的日产1850万桶提高到1950万桶提供了市场条件。
    西方世界石油需求量上升主要有两个原因，一是油价偏低，二是西方工业化国家经济持续增长。
    1986年“油价战”引起油价暴跌后，油价一直处于不稳定状态，虽有升有降，但截至今年初，始终没有达到欧佩克所追求的每桶18美元的目标。去年10月份，油价曾一度跌至每桶10美元以下。低油价刺激了西方国家石油需求量的膨胀。据国家能源机构说，近几年石油消费每年以每天100万桶的速度增加，部分是低油价的刺激造成的。
    西方工业化国家的经济持续增长是石油需求量上升的主要原因。据经合组织在一份报告中说，1988年经合组织24个成员国的平均经济增长率达4％，其中日本的经济增长率最高，达到5％。因此，它的石油需求量增长也最多。据英国《石油经济学家》报道，1988财政年度上半年，日本石油需求量比上一财政年度同期猛增6.4％，达每天307.76万桶，比原计划高4.1％。
    据经合组织预测，西方工业化国家的经济今年仍将增长3.5％。在一般情况下，西方国家的石油需求量的上升同其经济增长是同步的。预计今年这些国家的石油需求量将上升3.2％左右。
