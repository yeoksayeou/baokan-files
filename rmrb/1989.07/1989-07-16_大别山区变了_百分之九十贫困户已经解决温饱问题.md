The Dabie Mountains Have Changed: 90% of Poor Households Have Solved Their Food and Clothing Needs

Newspaper: Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 16th - (Reporters Luohui, Correspondent Zhaigang) News from the National Commission of Science and Technology's recent meeting in Ying Mountain County, Hubei Province, on the exchange of poverty alleviation experiences in four provinces indicates that scientific and technological poverty alleviation in the Dabie Mountains has achieved significant results. So far, 90% of the households in this region that were previously unable to meet their basic food and clothing needs have crossed the poverty line.

The Dabie Mountains include 18 counties that are key targets for poverty alleviation by the National Commission of Science and Technology. The focus of poverty alleviation work in the Dabie Mountains is to use science and technology as a pillar to vigorously develop the commodity economy. After the National Commission of Science and Technology sent scientific and technological poverty alleviation liaison groups to Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, each province selected scientific and technological deputy county magistrates for all poverty-stricken counties to strengthen leadership. Starting from 1986, each poverty-stricken county successively established a number of economic entities that combine science, technology, agriculture, industry, and commerce, with significant effects on poverty alleviation. According to statistics from Hubei and Anhui provinces, by October 1988, 345,000 households and 1,794,000 people in 11 key poverty-stricken counties had solved their food and clothing needs. Anhui Province's Jinzhai County successfully completed the development of 100,000 mu of tea gardens, 200,000 mu of mulberry gardens, and 300,000 mu of chestnut orchards. This county with a population of over 500,000, in just five years, will see per capita income from chestnuts alone reach 1,000 yuan.

    大别山区有18个县属于国家科委的重点扶贫对象。大别山区的扶贫工作重点是，以科技为支柱，大力发展商品经济。在国家科委给河南、安徽、湖北三省分别派了科技扶贫联络组后，各省又给所有的贫困县选派了科技副县长，强化领导。从1986年开始，各贫困县相继建立了一批科技、农、工、贸相结合的经济实体，脱贫效果显著。据湖北、安徽两省统计，到1988年10月，11个重点贫困县中，已有34.5万户、179.4万人的温饱问题得到了解决。安徽省金寨县胜利完成10万亩茶园、20万亩桑园和30万亩板栗的开发任务。这个50多万人口的贫困县，再过5年，仅板栗一项人均收入就可达1000元。
