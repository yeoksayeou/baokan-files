On the way back from visiting the Stone Forest, Xiaomei said, “Wait to see the essay written by Teacher Sun.”

“Everyone has already written about it, I dare not write, nor is it necessary,” I replied.

“If you were to write, it would only be a prose poem. There’s no need to write the usual descriptive and emotional texts,” I added.

“Why not write? Is there such a thing as writing too much?” Xiaoli picked up the topic. “Everyone is different. If I were to write, I would have four angles to choose from.”

Several people turned to look at Xiaoli with interest.

“This is a place of exposure, where the body and emotions are all nakedly exposed to people and the world, free, unrestrained, natural, a high level, a high realm. How about that? That’s one;

“This is like another world, a Dante-like hellish world, deep, profound, thick, in short, it’s a different world from ours. How about that? That’s two;

“This is a group full of anticipation, all waiting for the infusion of life, needing the breath of people, the comfort of people’s emotions, each rock and each piece like an artistic life. That’s three, right.

“As for the fourth, I can’t quite explain it. I don’t like to find specific symbols; I only have a general sense. What sense? It’s rich, but I can’t put it into words. It’s probably the power of nature!”

“You should write,” my wife, who never writes articles, also chimed in, influenced by Xiaoli, “Here it’s like a stone forest, like a stone sea, like a patch of mushrooms that grow well.”

Xiaomei smiled at the corners of her mouth: “Xiaomei must have a good article!” I teased her, and she wouldn’t speak unless teased.

“I can’t write. I just feel that this is a good place to write articles. If you lived here to read and write, it would definitely be very good, everywhere can inspire your inspiration, especially when your thoughts are dry and you can’t write. Just stand here and look, inspiration will burst out.”

“That’s right. When you come to the Stone Forest, your heart won’t be at peace,” I said.

“Look, have you thought it out?” Xiaomei provoked me again.

I really wanted to say something.

This is my second time coming to the Stone Forest. The first time, I hurriedly looked, climbed, and exclaimed, but I was looking at the scenery, the myriad postures of the strange and grotesque, unseen before, like when a young man sees a beautiful girl and his thoughts freeze. That time, I only left an impression: Stone Forest, perhaps the words “Stone Forest” locked my thoughts. This tyrannical language, this man-made shackle.

This time, it’s like meeting an old friend after a long separation, the heart is hot and clear, as if walking into a world of poetry.

This poem is not written in words, it is non-cultural, but it is true poetry. Its group of images should be how rich, abrupt, magnificent, and strange! Read it, its rhythm, its sentiment, its rhythm, staggered and uneven, coming and going, twisting and turning, beyond expectation. Various landscapes of nature, various members of the biological world, various behaviors of humans, all solidified into a poem, published in this place. Read it, read it! Gallop your power of observation, especially your imagination! The longer you read, the more you gain! The longer you read, the more you can’t finish! Its indeterminacy, multiplicity, vagueness, ambiguity, symbolism, all converge to its richness, it will completely let you fall into the madness of poetry. Especially, if you don’t understand modernist poetry, then please come here to read, you will not only gain the joy of interpretation, but also the joy of creation. The ancient humans or other creators created this piece of poetic code, please come to decipher it.

This is also a philosophical debate classroom.

Just like scholars from all over the country and even the world gather in Yunnan to discuss a certain academic issue, the Stone Forest is also holding a meeting.

Representatives of various aspects of the universe—you recognize them, they have all come.

This meeting has been going on for so long, the sea has become land, the land has become sea, who knows how many changes? The stone lotus blooms once every ten thousand years, who knows how many times it has bloomed? The sword peaks have been honed for how many million years to be so sharp? After a crustal movement, the sea water erodes the hard rocks into one city gate after another, the sea water surges around the attendees, the waistlines are eroded into grooves, the necks are eroded into hollows, they all do not care, Alishan has been calling them for so long, they still do not disperse, the lovers on the Waiting-for-Husband Rock have been longing for so long, they do not even turn their heads.

They have been arguing, arguing about questions they will never be able to resolve. These people are also like humans, always thinking about what the universe is, what humans are. Human life compared to the age of the universe is just a blink of an eye, how can you prove what happened in the billions of years? How can you predict what will happen in the billions of years to come? What is your essence, where do you come from, where do you go, how can you jump out of your shell to be a clear observer? Perhaps the more unclear it is, the more interesting it becomes, the more you want to think, the more you want to say, the more you want to argue. Just like this, they have been arguing for billions of years, until today, humans have been infected and are also arguing about the same questions, this is both respectable and frightening obsession and persistence!

I expressed these strange thoughts.

I felt a sense of relief. I felt like I had walked out of the labyrinth of poetry and philosophy, away from the heavy Stone Forest.

I said again.

    诗与哲学的迷宫
    ——石林解读
    孙荪
    游石林回来的路上，小梅说：“等着看孙老师写的散文吧。”
    “都叫人家写尽了，不敢写，也无需写了。”我回答。
    “要写也只能写散文诗，通常的描景抒情文字，不必写了。”我又说。
    “不敢写，为什么？难道文章还有写尽的吗？”小李接了话题，“一人一个样。我要写就有四种角度可供选择。”
    几个人都转过脸来，有兴致地看了看小李。
    “这是一个裸露的所在，身体、感情，全都赤裸裸地暴露在人的面前，世界的面前，自由，自在，自然，一个高层次，高境界。怎么样？这是一；
    “这像另一个世界，但丁的地狱式的世界，深刻，深沉，深厚，总之，这是不同于我们这个世界的另一个世界。怎么样，此其二；
    “这是充满期待的群体，它们全都等待着生命之气的贯注，它需要人的生气吹拂，人的感情抚慰，每一座每一片都像一个艺术生命。这是第三了吧。
    “第四嘛，我还讲不大清楚，我不喜欢找出什么具体的象征，我只有总体的感悟。感悟什么，很丰富，却说不出来。大概是自然的伟力吧！”
    “应该写”，从不写文章的妻受了小李的感染也插了话，“这里像石林，又像石海，又像一片长得喜人的蘑菇。”
    小梅嘴角挂着笑：“小梅一定有好文章了！”我逗她，她不逗是不说话的。
    “我不会写。我只是觉得这里是写文章的好地方。要是住在这里读书写文章一定是极好的，处处都能激发人的灵感，尤其是文思枯竭写不下去的时候。往这里一站一看，灵感就会迸发出来。”
    “不错。到了石林，你的心里是不会安生的。”我说。
    “看，想好了吧。”小梅又激将。
    我真的想说点什么。
    我这是第二次来石林。第一次来，匆忙地看呀，爬呀，感叹呀，但看的是景，是千姿百态的奇形怪状的见所未见的景，好象青年时见到漂亮姑娘时思路凝住一样。那一次只留下一片印象：石林，也许是“石林”两个字把我的思路框住了。这专制的语言，人造的枷锁。
    这次来，极像会见久别的朋友，心境热烈而澄净，仿佛走进诗的世界。
    这诗不用文字写成，是非文化的，但是真正的诗，它的意象群该是何等丰富、突兀、瑰丽、诡怪！你读吧，它的韵味，它的情致，它的节奏，错落参差，往还曲折，出人意表。自然界的各种景色，生物界的各种成员，人类的各种行为，都凝定为一种诗，在这一块地方发表出来。你读吧，读吧！驰骋你的观察力尤其是你的想象力吧！你读多久就有多少收获！你读多久都读不完！它的不确定性、多义性、朦胧性、模糊性、象征性，汇聚成它的丰富性，它会整个地让你陷入诗的迷狂之中。特别是，你要是不懂现代派的诗，那就请来这里一读，你将不只获得解读的快乐，还将获得创作的快乐。远古的人类或别的造物主造的这一片诗的密码，请你来破译吧。
    这还是一片哲学的争鸣课堂。
    就像来自全国以至世界各地的学者云集云南就某个学术问题展开争鸣，石林也在举行一个会议。
    宇宙的各方面代表——你辨认吧，都来了。
    这个会议开得这样久，沧海桑田，桑田沧海，不知几多变化？石莲花一万年开一次，也不知开了多少次？剑峰的峰刃也不知磨砺了多少万年才如此锋利？一次地壳变动以后，海水把坚硬的岩石冲成一个个城门洞府，海水在与会者的周身冲来荡去，腰围被冲成带痕，脖颈被冲成凹窝，他们全不理会，阿诗玛呼唤了他们那么久，他们仍不散场，望夫石上的情人翘盼了那样久，他们头也不回。
    一直在争论，争论他们永远也争论不清的问题。这群人也像人类一样颟顸，总在思考宇宙是怎么回事，人是怎么回事。人的生命同宇宙年龄相比，只是一眨一瞬，你怎么能证实亿万斯年间发生过的事情？你怎么能预知亿万斯年后将要发生的变化？你的本体是什么，从何处来，到何处去，你怎么能够跳出你的躯壳去作清醒的旁观者？大概愈是说不清楚愈有兴趣，愈要想，愈要说，愈要争。就这样争论了亿万斯年，以至今天的人类受了传染也在争论同样的问题，这可敬而又可怕的痴迷与执著！
    我说出了这些古怪的想法。
    我感到一阵轻松。我好像是走出了诗与哲学的迷宫，离开了沉重的石林。
    我又说。
