The approximation of the value of π can be calculated to how many decimal places? The mathematician Zu Chongzhi from the Northern and Southern Dynasties of China was the first to calculate π = 3.1415… During the present time, Japanese scholars have used computers to calculate π to 5.3 billion decimal places, which is the highest number to date.

Calculating the value of π is often used as a means to verify the performance of electronic computers and computer software. Since 1981, Professor Kanji Kaneda from Tokyo University has been using electronic computers to calculate the value of π. At that time, he had calculated it to 2 million decimal places. Since then, the calculation records have been continuously updated. In March of last year, Kaneda used a Hitachi supercomputer to calculate it to 201 million decimal places. In June of this year, a calculation group from Columbia University in the United States pushed the approximation to 4.8 billion decimal places. This time, Kaneda challenged the new record again. He used a supercomputer for 67 hours and 13 minutes to calculate it to 536,870,000 decimal places. It is said that if an ordinary computer were used, it would take 5 to 6 years or more. According to reports, Kaneda will continue to challenge the record of 1 billion decimal places in the future.

    日本学者计算π值创新纪录
    已算到小数点后五·三亿位
    本报讯　圆周率近似值可以算到多少位？我国南北朝时代的数学家祖冲之最早算出的π＝3.1415……的圆周率，目前日本学者运用计算机已算到小数点以下5.3亿位，这是迄今最高的数字。
    计算圆周率，常被利用来验证电子计算机和计算机软件性能的一种手段。日本东京大学副教授金田康正从1981年起就开始运用电子计算机计算圆周率，当时曾至200万位。此后，计算记录不断更新。去年3月，金田使用日立公司的巨型计算机算至2.01亿位；今年6月，美国哥伦比亚大学的计算小组又将近似值推向4.8亿位。这次金田又向新记录挑战，他使用巨型机用67小时13分钟的时间算至5.3687亿位，据说如用普通计算机计算需要5、6年以上。据报道，金田今后还将向小数点以下10亿位的记录挑战。
