South Korean authorities have summoned Kim Dae-jung, the chairman of the country's largest opposition party, the Democratic Party. The relationship between the Democratic Party and the authorities has become increasingly tense.

The South Korean Agency for National Security Planning summoned Kim Dae-jung in connection with a secret visit to Pyongyang by Democratic Party lawmaker Seo Jeong-yeol last August. After Kim Dae-jung refused the first summons, the agency issued a second summons on the afternoon of the 14th, demanding that he appear at the agency on the morning of the 15th to be questioned about Seo Jeong-yeol's visit to Pyongyang.

The Democratic Party held a meeting on the 14th, condemning the authorities' summons of Kim Dae-jung as an attempt to pressure the party and dissolve it. The meeting decided to establish an emergency committee to deal with the situation and to strongly resist the authorities' actions. The meeting also decided to hold a nationwide rally and launch a campaign of no-confidence in President Roh Tae-woo.

The Agency for National Security Planning announced that it will release the results of its investigation into the Seo Jeong-yeol case on the 17th and hand the case over to the prosecution for further action.

    南朝鲜当局传讯金大中
    平民党与当局关系日趋紧张
    新华社平壤7月15日电  汉城消息：南朝鲜第一大在野党平民党总裁金大中受到安全企划部的传讯，金大中拒绝接受传讯后，平民党与当局的关系日趋紧张。
    南朝鲜安全企划部因平民党议员徐敬元于去年8月秘密访问平壤而传讯金大中遭到拒绝后，14日下午又向金大中发出第二次传讯通知。要求在15日上午到安企部接受有关徐敬元访问平壤的调查。
    平民党14日召开会议，指责当局传讯金大中是向平民党施加压力和企图瓦解该党，要求当局立即停止这一行动。会议决定成立非常班子来应付这一事件，与当局进行强力抗争。会议还决定召开全国性集会，开展对卢泰愚的不信任运动。
    安企部决定于17日公布对徐敬元案件的调查结果，并移交检查厅处理。
