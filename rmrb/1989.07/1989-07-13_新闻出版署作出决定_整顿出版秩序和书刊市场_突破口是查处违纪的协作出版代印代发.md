The Press and Publication Administration has studied the important documents of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party, summarized the experiences and lessons of the publishing work in recent years, and decided to take resolute and decisive measures to rectify the order of publication and the book market.

In recent years, some publishing houses have pursued economic benefits solely, abandoned principles, and disregarded the physical and mental health of future generations. Pornographic, violent, and vulgar publications have flooded the book market, corrupting people's souls. It is particularly noteworthy that many of the so-called "street literature" that is full of filth often enters the book market under the guise of cooperative publishing. Although campaigns such as "strike hard" have been launched, the measures have not been effective enough, and the problem has not been fundamentally solved.

To cure the disease, one must treat the root cause. The improvement of the book market cannot rely solely on repeated "bans." After careful analysis and consideration, the Press and Publication Administration recently decided to take cooperative publishing and proxy printing and distribution as the breakthrough point to fundamentally change the chaotic situation of the book market.

Cooperative publishing is a new method that emerged during the publishing reform. Since it was piloted in 1984, it has played a certain positive role in alleviating the difficulty of publishing academic works, but it has also brought about many problems.

Although relevant departments have clear regulations on the scope of cooperative publishing and the objects of cooperation, many publishing houses have to varying degrees violated these regulations, causing serious chaos in publishing.

According to the spokesperson of the Press and Publication Administration, Liang Heng, this rectification of cooperative publishing and proxy printing and distribution is an important measure for the publishing department to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee and a continuation of the policy of rectification and order. In addition to continuing to strengthen administrative measures, economic sanctions will also be implemented.

The Press and Publication Administration stated in the issued document that this rectification mainly targets the violations that occurred since the "Several Opinions on the Current Reform of Publishing Houses" was jointly issued by the Propaganda Department and the Press and Publication Administration in May 1988.

The document stipulates: For books (including those that violate the scope of cooperative publishing, the objects of cooperative publishing, those that have not undergone final proofreading and final editing, and those that are published with book numbers) that violate the regulations on cooperative publishing and proxy printing and distribution, the profits of both parties involved in the cooperation will be confiscated and handed over to the local financial department; for such violations that occurred after the "Supplementary Regulations" were issued in February 1989, heavier penalties will be imposed, with the fine amount being more than five times the profit; for the other party involved in the cooperation with the publishing house that changes the content or increases the print run in violation of the contract, in addition to confiscating the profit, a fine of more than five times the profit will also be imposed; for those that clearly sell book numbers or sell book numbers in disguise, in addition to confiscating the profit from selling book numbers and imposing heavier fines, the publishing house will also be subject to suspension of business or revocation of registration, and the responsibility of the leaders of the publishing house will be investigated.

Inspection and rectification of the book market have become urgent. The Press and Publication Administration has issued an emergency notice, specifying the scope of inspection and rectification: For publications that involve planning and organizing counter-revolutionary riots and advocating bourgeois liberalization, for pornographic and obscene publications, for publications that have been notified to stop selling and for illegal publications, strict measures will be taken according to relevant regulations; for publications that advocate feudal superstition, murder, violence, and contain obscene and pornographic content, they will be confiscated and destroyed.

The Press and Publication Administration has ordered the press and publication bureaus of all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to take immediate action to quickly reverse the situation of the book market.

It is reported that the Press and Publication Administration will also take effective measures to rectify collective and individual book distribution points.

    新闻出版署作出决定
    整顿出版秩序和书刊市场
    突破口是查处违纪的协作出版代印代发
    新华社北京7月13日电  新闻出版署认真学习党的十三届四中全会重要文件，总结近年来出版工作的经验教训，决定采取坚决果断措施，整顿出版秩序和书刊市场。
    这几年，一些出版社单纯追求经济效益，放弃原则，不顾后代身心健康，色情淫秽、暴力凶杀等低级庸俗出版物充斥图书市场，腐蚀着人们的灵魂。尤其值得注意的是，一些被称作“地摊文学”的污七八糟的东西大多是打着协作出版的旗号进入图书市场的。尽管开展过“严打”等活动，终因措施不得力，未能从根本上解决问题。
    治表更须治本。图书市场的改观，不能仅靠一次次“查禁”。经过冷静的分析思考，新闻出版署近日作出决定：以整顿协作出版和代印代发为突破口，从根本上改变图书市场的混乱状况。
    协作出版是出版改革中出现的一种新作法。自1984年试行以来，对缓解学术著作出版难起了一定的积极作用，但也出现了不少问题。
    尽管有关部门对协作出书范围、协作的对象等都有明文规定，但许多出版社不同程度地违反有关规定，造成出版方面的严重混乱。
    据新闻出版署新闻发言人梁衡介绍，这次整顿协作出版、代印代发是出版部门贯彻十三届四中全会精神的重要措施，也是贯彻治理整顿方针的继续，除继续加强行政措施以外，还要实行经济制裁。
    新闻出版署在下发的文件中说，这次主要整顿从1988年5月中宣部、新闻出版署联合发布《关于当前出版社改革的若干意见》以来的违纪活动。
    文件规定：凡违反协作出版、代印代发规定的图书（包括违反协作出书范围、协作出版对象、未经终审终校及以书号出刊等问题），协作双方利润一律没收，上交当地财政部门；此类违纪图书在1989年2月《补充规定》下发以后出版的，要从重处罚，罚款数额要在所得利润的5倍以上；与出版社协作的对方违背合同更改内容或增加印数的，除没收利润外，还要加处利润5倍以上的罚款；确属卖书号或变相卖书号的，除没收卖书号所得利润和从重罚款以外，对出版社还要给以停业整顿或撤销登记的处分，同时追究出版社领导者的责任。
    检查、整顿书刊市场已成当务之急。新闻出版署为此下发了紧急通知，规定了检查、整顿的范围：对涉及策划、组织反革命暴乱和宣扬资产阶级自由化的书刊，对淫秽、色情出版物，对已通知停售的书刊和非法出版物，要严格按照有关规定查处；对宣扬封建迷信、凶杀暴力和夹杂淫秽色情内容的出版物一律收缴销毁。
    新闻出版署已责成各省、市、自治区新闻出版局迅速采取行动，尽快扭转图书市场的局面。
    据介绍，新闻出版署还将采取有力措施，整顿集体、个体图书发行点。
