On May 4, 1988, when Peking University was celebrating its 90th anniversary, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian jumped out and gave a stirring performance. On that very afternoon, Fang, Li, and Liu Gang (one of the wanted leaders of the "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation") organized a chaotic "Democracy Salon." Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian took the stage first. Fang ranted about how he "disagreed with the proposal to build socialism with Chinese characteristics," because "modernization has no borders." Li Shuxian fanned the flames, talking about "China's Bruno," and shouting, "I am willing to be a grain of sand, paving a path to freedom for future generations." Some even thought Fang Lizhi's strategy of "intellectuals joining the party to change the party's color" was not radical enough, and proposed "laying a new railway, building a new train." The "Democracy Salon" started with a strong political tone and a heavy atmosphere of gunpowder.

From that day until May 12, 1989, a total of 17 "Democracy Salons" were held, mainly organized by Wang Dan and others, with Fang and Li as advisors. From the materials available, it is clear that Fang Lizhi, Li Shuxian, Wang Dan, and others were so eager to hold the "Democracy Salon" to create public opinion, recruit followers, and prepare for the turmoil to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system.

(I)

The "Democracy Salon" was not really about democracy. This can be seen from the standards they set for inviting participants.

Wang Dan openly demanded that the school provide them with "freedom to invite famous scholars," and "guarantee that anyone except those deprived of political rights can be invited." Li Shuxian echoed Wang Dan, saying, "A scholar, a person, as long as they have not been deprived of political rights, they should have the freedom to speak. They are Chinese citizens and should have the right to be invited." However, another organizer of the "Salon" said, "Someone suggested inviting people like Qu Xiao here, we think it's unnecessary."

So, who did they want to invite? Wang Dan bluntly said, "We are discussing political issues, so we need to find some scholars with insights." Over the past year, they invited speakers such as the infamous Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, as well as prominent figures like Bao Zhenxin, Ren Wencheng, Dai Qing, Wu Zuguang, and Xu Liangying who advocated for bourgeois liberalization. They even invited the ambassador and his wife from a certain country without proper diplomatic procedures.

These people in the "Salon" shamelessly peddled bourgeois liberalization, attacking the four cardinal principles from political, economic, and cultural angles.

When talking about the leadership of the Communist Party, Wang Dan arrogantly shouted, "We probably need to touch the tiger's ass." Someone even boldly called for "establishing an opposition party." They maliciously attacked Marxism, saying it is "an anti-modernization theory." They shouted, "To achieve democracy, the key is to change China's environment." They slandered "China's leaders do not respect human rights" and openly defended the counter-revolutionary Wei Jingsheng, saying he is "a young man with potential, a talent, and should be cherished." They vigorously advocated for freedom of speech, press, and publication against the four cardinal principles, claiming to "publish their own newspapers and magazines to spread democratic ideas." They attacked the party's news policy, saying, "Today's newspaper censorship exceeds that of the Kuomintang era." When it came to eliminating spiritual pollution and opposing bourgeois liberalization, these people gnashed their teeth. A prominent figure in the salon snarled, "These two things are obviously absurd." They also chattered on about how "intellectuals should become an independent political force," "a leading class, playing a dominant role."

Lu Xun once said: "Those who plot must have their tricks." This bunch of hypocritical intellectuals, after years of meticulous planning, finally sensed some unusual political air and eagerly joined the fray. They tore off their last veil, brazenly advocating for bourgeois liberalization. Their so-called "academic discussions" were false; opposing the four cardinal principles was true. Their shouted "democracy" was false; their attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, the socialist system, and the People's Republic was true. They were not "cultural people" or "elites," but a bunch of vanguards advocating for bourgeois liberalization. The "Democracy Salon" became their base for attacking the party and socialism.

(II)

The organizers of the "Democracy Salon" knew that to achieve their goals, merely creating public opinion and ideological mobilization was not enough. Thus, they frequently engaged in organizational activities.

On April 5 of this year, Wang Dan incited at the "Salon," "All intellectuals feel that something will happen this year. I hope everyone unites at this moment." He also said, "If everyone is more active, the process will advance." Li Shuxian further explained, "As long as everyone has this attitude, it's fine."

In fact, their organizational activities began with the launch of the "Salon." As soon as the "Salon" opened, Wang Dan became a frequent guest of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian. Fang and Li highly praised Wang, even mentioning him in interviews with Hong Kong reporters. Wang Dan, in turn, always referred to "Teacher Fang" and "Teacher Li."

Of course, their organizational activities were not limited to a few leaders. To build a broader organization, they schemed and played many tricks.

In the latter half of last year, Wang Dan and others prepared to establish the "Contemporary Chinese National Conditions Research Association," demanding "independent activity freedom" from the school, which was naturally not approved. At the end of the year, Wang Dan again used the banner of a certain student organization to establish the "Contemporary Social Problems Department" of this organization, inviting Zhang Xianyang, Yu Haocheng, Xu Liangying, Wu Zuguang, Dai Qing, and 22 others as advisors, pulling out the big flag and using the tiger's skin, but was again rejected by the school. The school also sent people to talk to Wang Dan multiple times, pointing out that his activities violated school regulations. However, he ignored the school's help and education, becoming even more arrogant in his activities.

In early April of this year, to make the "Democracy Salon" a legal organization, Wang Dan launched a signature campaign among students. On April 3, Wang Dan posted a letter with 56 student signatures in the Sanjiao area of Peking University to the school leadership and relevant departments, demanding that the school support the "Democracy Salon," provide a venue for the "Salon" activities, and even notified some Hong Kong and Macau reporters in advance, attempting to use overseas media to pressure the school.

The school still did not agree. Wang Dan and others were angry and held a special "Salon" for this. Wang Dan fiercely incited more teachers and students to support them through signatures. Li Shuxian also jumped to the stage again, clearly stating her "strong support for this matter," expressing "great respect" for the signing students, and even personally visiting the school leaders to make the "Democracy Salon" legal.

On April 19, the student movement had already begun. That night, they held another "Democracy Salon," focusing on the establishment of the organization, and on the spot elected Wang Dan, Feng Congde, Xiong Yan, and 4 others to form the "Peking University Autonomous Student Union Preparatory Committee," attempting to replace the legally elected school student union and graduate student union.

After such intense activities, they indeed gathered a team. The organizers and active participants of the "Democracy Salon," such as Wang Dan, Liu Gang, Feng Congde, Yang Tao, Xiong Yan, Guo Haifeng, and others, all became the leaders and core members of the illegal organization "Beijing Autonomous Students Federation" during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion.

(III)

The organizers of the "Democracy Salon" and the prominent figures of bourgeois liberalization were in cahoots, constantly looking for opportunities to strike. On April 15, Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away. They thought the time had come, so they intensified their incitement and plotting, finally creating a shocking turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion.

After the incident, they encouraged each other, frequently contacting each other. Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian constantly instructed Wang Dan and others, while Bao Zhenxin, Chen Mingyuan, Ren Wencheng, and others gave multiple lectures at Peking University.

On May 12, during the so-called "low tide" of the student movement, they held the 17th "Democracy Salon." Bao Zhenxin in the "Salon" ranted, saying, "The date of April 27 will be prominently recorded in the history of the People's Republic of China," "its scale and far-reaching impact have surpassed May Fourth," clearly proposing that "the April 26 editorial should be overturned." He also incited, saying that when he heard students marching to Tiananmen Square, "he was immediately excited." To encourage students, he also said, "April 27 is worth commemorating in Chinese history," saying that the significance of "April 27" lies in "marking the end of long-term feudal patriarchal autocratic rule in China."

At that time, many young students began to lose interest in the turmoil, feeling confused and tired. Bao Zhenxin's nonsense undoubtedly played a role in fanning the flames.

That afternoon, Wang Dan and 2 others posted an "Absolute Hunger Strike Declaration" in Peking University. The next day, hundreds of students in Beijing began a hunger strike. Yan Jiya, Bao Zhenxin, Su Shaoji, and others staged a farce of a grand march of the capital's intellectuals to support the hunger-striking students. It can be seen that the organizers of the "Democracy Salon" and the prominent figures of bourgeois liberalization were perfectly coordinated!

Good people are hard to foresee the conspiracy of this small group of counter-revolutionaries. But the facts make us sober: we must firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles, and clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, otherwise the country will have no peace. At the same time, we must never relax our vigilance against counter-revolutionaries, because they are never asleep and will use various forms to attack us at any opportunity. In this sense, we should thank the "Democracy Salon" for providing us with an excellent negative example.

    一个制造动乱的“沙龙”
    郑彦
    1988年5月4日，正当北京大学师生欢度校庆90周年之际，方励之、李淑娴跳将出来，作了一番淋漓尽致的表演。就在这天下午，由方、李和刘刚（被通缉的“高自联”头目之一）一手策划的“民主沙龙”乱哄哄地开了场。方励之、李淑娴首先登台。方胡说什么“不同意建设有中国特色的社会主义现代化的提法”，因为“现代化不分国界”；李淑娴则尽其煽风点火之能事，大谈“中国的布鲁诺”，叫嚣“甘愿作一粒沙子，为后人铺就一条自由之路”。还有人认为方励之提出的“知识分子要入党，要改变党的颜色”这个反对中国共产党的策略不够劲，索性提出“要重铺一条铁路，重造一列火车”。“民主沙龙”一开场，就充满了政治色彩，火药味十足。
    从这天起到1989年5月12日，一共举办了17次“民主沙龙”，主要由王丹等人主持，方、李充当军师。从已掌握的材料可以清楚地看出，方励之、李淑娴、王丹等人如此卖力地举办“民主沙龙”，就是要为日后制造动乱，推翻中国共产党的领导和社会主义制度，制造舆论，网罗人马，进行思想和组织的准备。
    （一）
    名为“民主沙龙”，其实并非真是为了民主。这从他们邀请参加者的标准可见端倪。
    王丹公开要求学校给他们“邀请著名学者参加的自由”，“保证除被剥夺政治权利者外一律准许被邀请”。李淑娴也与王丹一唱一和，说什么“一个学者，一个人，只要没有被剥夺政治权利，他就有演讲的自由。他是中国公民，就应该有权利被邀请。”可是“沙龙”的另一名组织者却说：“有人提出请曲啸那种人来这里，我们认为没必要。”
    那末，他们究竟要请哪些先生呢？王丹直言不讳地说：“我们讨论的本来就是政治问题，当然要找一些有思想、有创见的先生来。”一年来，他们请的主讲人，除了臭名昭著的方励之、李淑娴夫妇外，还有包遵信、任畹町、戴晴、吴祖光、许良英等鼓吹资产阶级自由化的头面人物，甚至未经正式外交程序，就邀请了某国驻华大使和夫人。
    这些人在“沙龙”里肆无忌惮地兜售资产阶级自由化的货色，从政治、经济、文化等各个角度，全面攻击四项基本原则。
    谈到共产党领导时，王丹狂妄地叫嚷：“大概要摸摸老虎屁股了。”更有人公然喊出：“应该成立反对党”。他们肆意攻击马克思主义“是一种反现代化的理论”。狂叫：“要实现民主，关键问题在于改变中国的环境。”他们诬蔑“中国的领导人不讲人权”，公然为反革命分子魏京生鸣冤叫屈，说他“是有为的年青人，是人才，应当爱护。”他们极力鼓吹反对四项基本原则的言论自由、出版自由、新闻自由，声言要“办自己的报纸、杂志，传播民主思想。”他们攻击党的新闻政策，胡说什么“今天报纸的审查制度超过国民党统治的时候。”提到清除精神污染和反对资产阶级自由化，这些人更是咬牙切齿。参加这个沙龙的一个头面人物恶狠狠地说：“这两件事，一望而知，荒谬绝伦。”这些人还喋喋不休地叫嚷：“知识分子应该成为独立的政治力量”，“是领导阶级，起主导作用”。
    鲁迅说过：既捣鬼，就有术。这伙道貌岸然的文化人，经过几年来紧锣密鼓地筹划，终于嗅出了一点异常的政治空气，迫不及待地赤膊上阵了。他们撕去仅有的一点遮盖面纱，猖狂鼓吹资产阶级自由化。他们宣扬的“学术讨论”是假，反对四项基本原则是真；他们高喊的“民主”是假，妄图推翻共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，颠覆人民共和国是真。他们哪里是什么“文化人”、“精英”，分明是一伙鼓吹资产阶级自由化的急先锋。而“民主沙龙”则成为他们向党向社会主义发起进攻的阵地。
                        （二）
      “民主沙龙”的组织者深知，要达到某种目的，仅仅满足于“制造舆论”，进行“思想发动”是不够的，于是，他们又频繁进行了筹建组织的活动。
    今年4月5日，王丹在“沙龙”蛊惑说：“所有知识界，都感到今年要有事情发生。我希望在目前这个时机，大家都团结起来。”还说：“如果大家都窜腾得比较欢，这个进程就推进了。”李淑娴进一步说明：“大家都是这个态度，也就没关系了。”
    其实，他们的组织活动是伴随着“沙龙”的出笼而开始的。“沙龙”一开张，王丹就成为方励之、李淑娴的座上客。方、李对王十分赞赏，甚至在香港接受记者采访时也不忘吹捧王丹几句。而王丹则言必称“方老师”、“李老师”如何如何。
    当然，他们的组织活动绝不仅限于少数头头之间的来往。为了建立更广泛的组织，他们处心积虑，耍了不少花招儿。
    去年下半年，王丹等人筹备成立“当代中国国情研究会”，要求学校给予他们“独立活动的自由”，理所当然地未被批准。年底，王丹又打出某一学生社团的旗号，要成立这个社团的“当代社会问题部”，聘请张显扬、于浩成、许良英、吴祖光、戴晴等25人为顾问，拉大旗，作虎皮，又遭学校拒绝。学校还多次派人找王丹谈话，指出他的活动违反校规。但他对学校的帮助教育置若罔闻，更加猖狂地活动。
    今年4月初，为争取“民主沙龙”成为合法组织，王丹在学生中掀起一场签名运动。4月3日，王丹在北大三角地贴出有56个学生签名的给学校领导和有关部门的一封信，要求学校支持“民主沙龙”，开辟“沙龙”活动地点，并且事先通知一些港澳记者，企图借海外传媒给学校施加压力。
    对此，学校仍未同意。王丹等人恼羞成怒，专门为此举办了一次“沙龙”。王丹气势汹汹地鼓动更多的师生用签名的方式支持他们。李淑娴也再次跳到前台，明确表示她“很支持这件事”。对签名的学生表示“非常地尊敬”，并要亲自出马，“登门拜访校领导”使“民主沙龙”合法化。
    4月19日，学潮已经发生。这天晚上，他们又举行了一次“民主沙龙”，重点讨论成立组织的事情，当场推选出由王丹、封从德、熊焱等7人组成的“北大自治学生会筹委会”，企图取代合法产生的校学生会和研究生会。
    经过这样一番紧张的活动，他们确也拉起一支队伍。“民主沙龙”的组织者和积极参加者，如王丹、刘刚、封从德、杨涛、熊焱、郭海峰等在动乱和反革命暴乱中都成为非法组织“高自联”的头目和骨干分子。
                    （三）
      “民主沙龙”的组织者和资产阶级自由化头面人物沆瀣一气，无时无刻不在伺机发难。4月15日，胡耀邦同志逝世。他们以为时机已到，便加紧煽动、策划，终于制造了一场触目惊心的动乱和反革命暴乱。
    事发后，他们互相打气，互相呼应，接触愈加频繁。方励之、李淑娴不断给王丹等人耳提面命，包遵信、陈明远、任畹町等更是多次到北大讲演。
    5月12日，所谓“学运低潮”时期，他们又举行了第17次“民主沙龙”。包遵信在“沙龙”大放厥词，说什么“4·27这个日子在中华人民共和国的历史上将会大书特书”，“它的规模和深远影响都超过了五四”，明确提出“4·26社论应该推翻”。他还煽动说，一听到学生上天安门游行，“当时就特别兴奋起来”。为了给学生打气，他还胡说：“4·27”在中国历史上“值得纪念”，说“4·27”的意义在于“标志长期以来封建家长制的专制统治在中国应该结束了。”
    当时不少青年学生对动乱开始失去兴趣，感到迷惑、疲惫，包遵信的这一派胡言无疑起到了推波助澜的作用。
    当天下午，王丹等3人在北大贴出“绝食声明”。次日，北京几百名学生开始绝食。严家其、包遵信、苏绍智等人又导演一出首都知识界大游行的闹剧，声援绝食学生。可以看出，“民主沙龙”的组织者和资产阶级自由化的头面人物配合得是何等默契！
    善良的人们是很难预料这一小撮反革命分子的阴谋的。但事实却使我们清醒：必须坚定不移地坚持四项基本原则，必须旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，否则将国无宁日。同时，须臾不能放松对反革命分子的警惕，因为他们一刻都没有睡觉，还会利用各种形式，伺机向我们进攻。从这个意义上讲，我们倒是应该感谢“民主沙龙”给我们提供了一个绝好的反面教材。
