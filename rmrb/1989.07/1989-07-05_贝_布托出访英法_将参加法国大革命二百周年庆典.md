Benazir Bhutto Visits England and France
Will Participate in the 200th Anniversary Celebration of the French Revolution

	BEIJING, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto departed this morning for London on an official eight-day visit to Britain. She will then proceed to Paris to participate in the 200th anniversary celebration of the French Revolution. This is Bhutto's first visit to Western European countries since taking office.

	Because Bhutto studied in Britain and became the leader of an elected government, she will receive a high-level welcome. Bhutto will hold formal talks with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at 10 Downing Street on July 7, marking the first meeting between the two female government leaders. Their talks will focus on economic relations between Britain and Pakistan, Pakistan's return to the Commonwealth, and the political resolution of the Afghan issue. On July 10, Queen Elizabeth II will host a banquet for Bhutto at Buckingham Palace. To show special friendship, the Queen will invite Bhutto to travel to Paris on her special plane to participate in the 200th anniversary celebration of the French Revolution.

	During her stay in France, Bhutto will hold talks with the French President and Prime Minister. She will also meet with other national and government leaders attending the celebration.
