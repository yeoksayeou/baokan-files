	Seven hundred veterans of the original Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Border Column of the Chinese People's Liberation Army held a song and dance evening in Kunming on the eve of the "August 1" Army Day to enthusiastically sing the praises of the glorious achievements of the People's Liberation Army and local armed forces of various ethnic groups under the Party's leadership in their heroic struggles.

	The Yunnan-Guizhou-Guangxi Border Column was formed in 1949 by consolidating the main guerrilla forces from all ethnic groups in Yunnan Province into a Party-led local armed force. It had 12 brigades and two independent regiments, established 12 contiguous guerrilla base areas, and pinned down nearly 200,000 Nationalist troops. It made significant contributions to the liberation of Southwest China in coordination with the People's Liberation Army.
