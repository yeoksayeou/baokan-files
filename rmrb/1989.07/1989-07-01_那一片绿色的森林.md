This year, on Qingming Festival, I returned to my hometown, Jinganli, to present a belated wreath to Tree Root Uncle, who had never been related to my family for eight generations. On that day, it was drizzling lightly, and I ventured out in the rain to Tree Root Uncle's resting place...

Tree Root Uncle was not from Jinganli. He had fled to our village during a famine, and Wu Fafa, seeing his plight, took him in. At that time, Tree Root Uncle was only about ten years old. It is said that his original name was not Tree Root; this name was given to him by Wu Fafa, symbolizing the deep roots that would keep him forever in Jinganli.

However, Tree Root's life in Jinganli was quite difficult.

To this day, I still vividly remember Tree Root Uncle telling us kids, "I came to Jinganli at your age. I have nothing else to repay this land with, except to protect the forest on this land..." As if we were his confidants, he eagerly showed us the awards he had received for his forest protection efforts from the province, city, and county. Of course, we could not forget the frequent curses directed at Tree Root Uncle in Jinganli. The language was crude and unpleasant, with insults like "stray dog," "barren seed," "wretched soul" piled onto him. Tree Root Uncle never retaliated; if he did respond, it was only with, "I, Tree Root, am upright and honest, and the mountains and forests on both sides of Jinganli can bear witness!" His wife, however, was truly heartless. Unable to bear the humiliation, she left their five or six-year-old son and the man she had lived with for seven or eight years, abandoning Jinganli without a backward glance.

The wife left. Tree Root Uncle, however, continued to guard the forest day and night without hesitation. The son, having lost his mother, often followed his father into the mountains, enduring hardships at such a young age.

The most unforgettable was that Mid-Autumn night. According to tradition, it is a night for family reunions. That night, Tree Root Uncle broke his usual routine and did not go up the mountain. Did he realize he owed something to his son? Tree Root Uncle even bought 1 jin of mooncakes, staying home with his son to enjoy the moon. Perhaps, Tree Root Uncle later recalled that night? The moon was uniquely his—unique in its roundness, unique in its fragrance? Or was it uniquely pale, uniquely desolate?

But fate should not have been so cruel to Tree Root Uncle!

That night, as father and son were enjoying the sweet mooncakes and the clear moonlight, suddenly a strange sound drifted over from the back mountain. His long experience in forest protection made Tree Root Uncle sensitive to the sounds of the forest. He sprang up abruptly, hastily instructing his son, "Wait for me, I'll be back soon." He grabbed his forest protection machete and followed the sound up the mountain.

It turned out that someone was stealing trees. The thief was experienced, not using an axe to chop but lying sideways to saw with a saw, "sand sand sand," the sound was very faint, hard to hear. Alas, Tree Root Uncle, if only you had been less sensitive to the sounds of the forest; if only your ears had been a bit deaf... Just as Tree Root Uncle was tracking the tree thief, his son, seeing his father not returning for a long time, left home alone to look for him. Unexpectedly, he fell into the well behind their house, and a lively life was drowned on that night of family reunion. In his hand, he still tightly grasped half a mooncake. Perhaps the son wanted to find his father and personally offer him the mooncake.

From then on, Tree Root Uncle's body and spirit began to decline. But he still insisted on going to the mountains to protect the forest.

Every time before entering the mountain, Tree Root Uncle would always stand by the graves of his adoptive father and his deceased son for a long time. He must have wanted to tell the old and young relatives something, but he remained silent; if he did not want to say anything, he would still shed tears. A few years later, Tree Root Uncle also passed away. He died in the lush, green forest.

To this day, I still do not understand why human nature can shrink to such an extent—Tree Root Uncle's wife left home; his son fell into the well and died; weren't these all because Tree Root Uncle was devoted to protecting the green forest in Jinganli? Yet, when he died, some people opposed providing him with a coffin, and spoke coldly: "He, Tree Root, loves trees, he must also want to start with himself..."

I shivered. Not only at that time, but even today, more than ten years later, I still tremble!

The rain is misty. Arriving at Tree Root Uncle's grave, I was somewhat puzzled—had I come to the wrong grave? Tree Root Uncle had no descendants, and no relatives in Jinganli, so who added new soil to his grave, and who erected a tombstone for him? Moreover, it was so considerate, with young pine trees planted around the grave. In the gentle breeze, the small pines trembled, perhaps feeling a bit lonely?

Standing at Tree Root Uncle's grave, facing the once lush and green, but later barren mountains due to lack of care, perhaps someone has shed tears of shame—how can we explain this to our descendants?! I think: if the deceased knew, Tree Root Uncle, who has been gone for more than ten years, might have felt some comfort? Perhaps he would be filled with gratitude and say, "You... finally understood!"

The rain continues to fall, lightly. This soul-wrenching Qingming rain!

    那一片绿色的森林
    廖静仁
    今年清明，我回到了老家井湾里，给八辈子也未与我家沾上过亲戚的树根伯，送上一个迟献的花圈。这一天，淅淅地下着微雨，我冒雨去树根伯安息的墓地……
    树根伯不是我们井湾里人。他是逃荒来我们井湾里的，五发公看他可怜，就把他收留下来。那时，树根伯还只有十来岁年纪。听说并不叫树根，这名字是五发公给他取的，含有那种如树根般扎在井湾里，永不离开这块地的意思。
    只是，树根在井湾里却生存得很苦。
    我至今还清楚地记得，树根伯曾对我们伢儿说过：“我是你们这个年纪来井湾里的，我没有别的报答这块土地，只有护好这块土地上的森林……”似乎我们是他的知音，他津津乐道地把他自己护林获得的省、地、县颁发的奖状给我们看。当然了，也忘记不了常听到井湾里有人当着面呼天喊地诅咒树根伯。那言辞，粗野得难听，什么“野狗子哪”、“绝代种哪”、“讨不得好死哪”……把那些龌龊话都堆到了树根伯身上。树根伯从不对骂，倘是回话，也只那一句，“我树根自己光明磊落，井湾里两面的山林可以作证！”他婆娘却真是心狠，受不了这份气，竟丢下五六岁的儿子和共同生活了七八年的男人，甩手离开了井湾里，头也不回。
    婆娘走了。树根伯仍然是义无返顾白昼不分地守护在树林里。儿子没有了母亲，就常随父亲在身旁，那么小的年纪，跟父亲风餐露宿，自然是吃尽了苦头。
    最难忘是那年中秋的夜晚。按照传统习俗，那是一个月团圆人也团圆的节日。那一夜，树根伯破例没有上山去。是不是意识到欠下了儿子什么呢？树根伯还特意买了1斤月饼，陪着儿子在家里一起赏月。兴许，树根伯后来也曾作过那一夜的回忆罢？那月原来是他自家独有的一轮——是独有的团圞，独有的芳馨呢？还是独有的苍白，独有的凄清？
    只是命运不应该对树根伯那样的无情哦！
    那夜，父子俩正品着甜甜的月饼，赏着清清的月华的时候，忽然有一丝异样的声音从后山林子里飘了过来。长期的护林生涯，使树根伯对树林中的声音特别敏感，他倏地弹了起来，匆忙地吩咐儿子：“你等着我罢，我很快就回来的。”摸过那把护林砍刀，便循声上山去了。
    原来是有人去偷树。那偷树贼很有经验，他不是用斧子砍伐，而是把身子斜躺着用锯子锯，“沙沙沙”，声音极细，是不易被人听见的。唉，树根伯，要是你对树林里的声音没有这么敏感就好了；要是你的耳朵有一点背就好了……就在树根伯去追踪偷树贼的时候，儿子见父亲久久不回，便独个儿莽莽撞撞地离家去寻找父亲。不期，竟失足掉进了自家屋后的那口水井中，活蹦乱跳的一条生命，就在那一个月团圆人也团圆的夜晚被淹死了。他的手中，还紧捏着半边月饼。兴许，儿子是想寻找到父亲后，亲手把那月饼献给父亲吃的罢。
    从那以后，树根伯的身体和精神便垮了许多。但他还是坚持着去山中护林。
    每每进山之前，树根伯都总要在自己的养父和早夭的儿子的坟前伫立许久。他自然是想要告诉一老一少两位亲人些什么的，却又不语；若是不告诉什么，却又老泪纵横。没几年树根伯也死了。死在葱郁苍翠的树林里。
    我至今也不明白，人性的萎缩有时为什么会到如此地步——树根伯的婆娘离家出走了；儿子落井丧命了；不都是因为树根伯执著于井湾里那一片绿色森林的卫护吗？然而，他死了，却有人反对为他打打棺材，并且不阴不阳地讲出风凉话来：他树根爱树，他一定也愿意从自我做起的……
    我一阵寒颤。不仅在当时，就是十多年的今天也颤栗了！
    雨意空蒙。来到树根伯的墓前，竟有些疑惑——我是不是认错坟墓了？树根伯没有了后人，也无亲人在井湾里，是谁为他的坟上添了新土，是谁在他的墓前竖了墓碑？并且，那样地解人意，坟墓的四周，还栽种了翠嫩的小松树，微风拂拂中，小松树瑟瑟地抖着身子，是不是感觉得太孤独了些？
    伫立在树根伯的墓前，面对着这曾经苍翠碧绿过，而又因无人看管一度被砍伐得光秃秃了的群山，也许有人曾淌过羞愧的眼泪罢——我们如何向子孙后代交待啊？！我想：倘若死者有知，业已去世了十多年的树根伯，也许该感到了些许慰藉？或许，还会充满感激地说：“你们……终于认识到了！”
      雨仍然在下，淅淅地。这断魂的清明雨！
