The torch for the Second National Youth Games of the People's Republic of China was lit in a ceremony held this evening at the Northeast Liberation Monument in front of Peace Square in Shenyang. Key leaders from the State Sports Commission and Liaoning Province, along with 200 representatives from 36 delegations participating in the games, attended the ceremony.

Tonight, the Northeast Liberation Monument was surrounded by flowers and banners. The square was filled with the sound of drums and music, and thousands of spectators enthusiastically watched the torch lighting ceremony. At 18:20, Vice Governor Wang Wenyan of Liaoning Province announced the start of the Youth Games torch lighting ceremony. The military band played the Youth Games anthem, which is full of the spirit of the times and youthful vitality. Wu Shaozu, the Director of the State Sports Commission, lit the torch symbolizing friendship, unity, and victory, and raised it high to greet the cheering crowd, which erupted in applause. He then passed the torch to Li Changchun, the Governor of Liaoning Province, who in turn passed it to Wu Disheng, the Mayor of Shenyang. Finally, Wang Chuntang, a representative of the Shenyang marathon team and coach of the Shenyang race walking team, solemnly received the torch from Mayor Wu.

At 18:35, Dai Suli, the Chairman of the Liaoning Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, gave the signal, and the Youth Games torch relay marathon began. In Shenyang, over 600 athletes lined up under the blue Youth Games flag and torch, running through several major bustling streets in the city, covering a distance of about 5 kilometers, and escorting the torch to the city government. Along the route, tens of thousands of citizens orderly watched the marathon event.

Tomorrow, the Youth Games torch will be relayed by a designated person from Shenyang to Jinzhou. According to the schedule, the torch relay will also pass through Liaoyang, Anshan, Yingkou, Dalian, Dandong, Fushun, and Tieling. On September 6, during the opening ceremony of the Youth Games, the torch, which has been relayed for dozens of days, will ignite the main stadium of the Youth Games—Shenyang Wulihe Sports Center.
