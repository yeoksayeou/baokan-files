I cannot sing, but I love listening to songs. The melodious and soaring rendition of "Bird Wings" by the renowned singer Cloud Sparrow, and the tranquil and gentle "Night at the Military Port," have all given me moments of aesthetic pleasure.

However, the song that burns like fire in my heart, giving me strength and inspiration, and making a lasting impression on me, is not a famous song performed by a renowned singer, nor is it a new song by a rising star. Instead, it is a song sung by a revered elder, an old Red Army soldier with white hair, using his rugged voice to sing the songs of Jinggangshan...

?Ya lei, ei—
The good work style of workers and peasants,
Wearing straw shoes to work...

That robust voice is like a flame, always burning in my heart...

In 1981, I attended the Military Academy's accelerated training class. At that time, I was merely a deputy division-level officer who had served as a deputy military attaché, while the classmates in the accelerated training class were all military and division-level leaders with extensive battle experience, including famous war heroes from the Korean War. I naturally felt honored to study with them. What moved me even more was the leadership of the academy: Xiao Ke, He Changgong, Duan Suquan... These legendary figures in the history of the Party and the military were so kind and humble in front of us students. I silently told myself: This must be the style of Jinggangshan or Yan'an.

That year, on July 1st, it was the 60th anniversary of the Party's founding. The academy held a celebration, with Vice President He Changgong delivering a speech. This old Red Army soldier with white hair and a youthful appearance, dressed in a green military uniform, sat on the stage with a spirited demeanor, speaking in his Hunan accent about the long and arduous journey of the Party. The joys of victory, the lessons of failure, combined with the many legendary experiences of Old He, were full of ups and downs and yet easy to understand. He had no script and did not need one, because his personal experiences were so closely tied to the history of the Party and the military; because for decades, he had dedicated his entire youth, blood, and life to our great revolutionary cause, sharing the same breath and destiny with the Party, the country, and the people. In his own words, he was willing to be a "lifelong laborer" for the revolution...

Below the stage, the military personnel sat in neat rows, including high-ranking officials with silver hair, middle and high-level officials in their prime, and young and energetic junior commanders. All in green military uniforms, like a vast forest...

After Old He finished speaking, he still showed no signs of fatigue and enthusiastically sang the mountain songs from the early days of the Jinggangshan revolutionary base:

?Ya lei, ei—
The good work style of workers and peasants,
Wearing straw shoes to work...

Ah, how pure and natural, how smooth, like the wind and springs of Jinggangshan, each word entering the heart and soul.

I seemed to see, after the Autumn Harvest Uprising, under the orders of Comrade Mao Zedong, Old He, wearing straw shoes, risking his life, traveling between Hunan, Guangdong, and Jiangxi, searching for the troops of the Nanchang Uprising, finally meeting with Comrade Zhu De, and playing a crucial role in the merger of the two earliest worker-peasant armed forces in China at Jinggangshan; I seemed to see him being tasked with reforming the Wang Zuo army occupying Jinggangshan, turning this peasant army into a worker-peasant revolutionary force under the Party's leadership; I seemed to see him, during the battles of Qixi Ridge and Longyuan Pass, commanding the 28th Division of the Red Fourth Army with Wang Erzhu, achieving continuous victories, and defending the Jinggangshan revolutionary base; I seemed to see the Jinggangshan people, in the harsh environment of "scraping salt from the walls and cooking wild herbs for food" and the white terror of "grass must be burned, stones must be cut, and people must be transformed," still remaining steadfast; I seemed to see...

After the song ended, the venue erupted. The quiet green forest suddenly resonated with thunderous applause, like the rolling pine waves...

Old He was full of vigor, singing one song after another. Perhaps he felt that singing while sitting was not enough to express his feelings, so he stood up.

Finally, Old He proposed that everyone sing "The Internationale." Immediately, the green forest echoed with the powerful, majestic, and heart-stirring waves. I saw many military and division-level leaders, who had never shed tears easily, with tears in their eyes, just like me...

Many years have passed, but Old He's singing still echoes in my heart, inspiring and strengthening me.

Last year, when I heard the news of Old He's passing on the radio, I was deeply saddened. I was unable to attend Old He's farewell ceremony, but when the television broadcast the news program, I stood in my military uniform in front of the screen, where Old He lay among the flowers, that selfless, unassuming, frank, and generous old Red Army soldier who was loyal to the people and the Party, and paid his respects with a military salute.

Old He has passed away, but his singing and his spirit will forever remain in our hearts.

    永不消逝的歌声
    彭龄
    我不会唱歌，却爱听歌。歌唱家云雀样婉转高亢的《鸟翅》，还有那秋水般恬淡轻柔的《军港之夜》，都给过我美的享受。
    然而，火似的燃烧着我的心胸，给我力量，给我鼓舞，令我久久不能忘怀的，却不是那些久负盛名的歌唱家唱的名曲，也不是那些初露头角的新秀们唱的新歌，而是一位令人景仰的长者，一位白发苍苍的老红军，用他粗犷的嗓音唱的井冈山歌……
    ?呀嘞，哎——
    工农干部好作风，
    脚蹬草鞋来办公……
    那苍劲的歌声，就像一团火，时时燃烧在我的心中……
    1981年，我到军事学院高级速成班学习，当时，我仅是一名刚刚担任过一任副武官的副团职干部，而速成班的学员都是身经百战的军、师两级领导，其中还有抗美援朝时著名的战斗英雄，能和他们一起学习，我自然感到荣幸。更使我感动的是，学院的领导：肖克、何长工、段苏权……这些在党史、军史上赫赫有名的人物，在我们学员们面前，那样和蔼、朴实。我默默地对自己说：这大概就是井冈山或延安的作风吧？
    那年七·一，是党成立60周年，学院举行庆祝会，由何长工副院长作报告。这位鹤发童颜的老红军，穿一身绿军装，精神矍铄地坐在主席台上，用他带着湖南乡音的语调，从从容容地讲起党走过的漫长而艰苦的历程。胜利的喜悦，失败的教训，结合着何老本人那许许多多传奇似的经历，跌宕起伏，而又深入浅出。他没有稿子，也无需稿子，因为他本人的经历和我们党史、军史是那样贴切；因为他几十年如一日，把他全部的青春、热血、年华以至生命统统融进了我们伟大的革命事业，同党、同国家、同人民，同呼吸、共命运。用他自己的话说，是愿为革命“当一辈子长工”……
    台下，军容严整，坐满各系、各队的教、学员，他们中间，有两鬓飞雪的首长，有年富力强的中高级干部，也有来学习参谋业务的朝气勃勃的初级指挥员。一色绿军装，像一座壮阔的森林……
    何老讲完了，仍毫无倦容，竟兴致勃勃地唱起井冈山革命根据地初创时期的山歌来：
    ?呀嘞，哎——
    工农干部好作风，
    脚蹬草鞋来办公……
    啊，多么纯朴，多么流畅，像井冈清风，像井冈飞泉，一句句，扑入胸怀，沁入心中。
    我仿佛看见，秋收起义后，受毛泽东同志的派遣，何老脚蹬草鞋，冒着生命危险，奔走于湘、粤、赣之间，寻找南昌起义的部队，终于与朱德同志接上头，为中国最早的两支工农武装会师井冈立下了不朽功绩；仿佛看见他受命去改造占据井冈山的王佐部队，使这支农民武装变为党领导下的工农革命队伍；仿佛看见在七溪岭和龙源口战斗中，他和王尔琢同志一起，指挥红四军二十八团，连连告捷，保卫了井冈山革命根据地；仿佛看见井冈军民在“熬墙上硝土当盐，煮山中百草当饭”的艰苦环境中和“草要过火，石要过刀，人要换种”的白色恐怖下，依旧矢志不移；仿佛看见……
    一曲唱罢，会场沸腾了。静悄悄的绿色森林里突然响起震耳欲聋的掌声，就像那滚滚松涛……
    何老意气风发，一曲接一曲。大概他老人家觉得坐着唱不足以唱出他的情怀，竟至站了起来。
    最后，何老提议，全体高唱《国际歌》。于是，绿色的森林中，立即轰响起那浑厚、雄壮、慑人心魄的涛声。我看见许多身经百战从不轻弹泪珠的军师首长们的眼里，也像我一样，饱含着泪花……
    多少年过去了，何老的歌声却一直在我心中回旋，给我鼓舞，给我力量。
    前年年底，当我从广播中听到何老病故的消息时，心中十分悲痛。我未能参加何老告别仪式，但电视台播放新闻节目时，我军容严整地对着电视屏幕上那安卧在鲜花丛中的何老，那不居功，不擅权，豪爽刚直，豁达大度，为人民、为党忠心耿耿，当了一辈子“长工”的老红军，恭恭敬敬地行了一个军礼。
    何老故去了，但他的歌声和他的精神一样，却永远留在我们心中。
