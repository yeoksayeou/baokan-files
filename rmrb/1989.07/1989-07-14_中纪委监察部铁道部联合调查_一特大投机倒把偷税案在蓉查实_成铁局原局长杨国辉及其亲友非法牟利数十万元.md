Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, July 14th - Recently, a joint investigation team consisting of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, the Supervision Department, and the Ministry of Railways uncovered a major case of speculation and tax evasion in Chengdu. The Chengdu Railway Bureau's former director, Yang Guohui, and his associates, through the Chengdu Four Communications Daily Chemical Trading Department, illegally profited from the resale of state-controlled materials, including phosphate ore, earning tens of thousands of yuan.

Yang Guohui joined the revolution in 1937 and the Communist Party in 1938. He served as the director of the Chengdu Railway Bureau from 1979 until his retirement in 1985.

According to the investigation, in October 1987, with Yang Guohui's involvement, his wife, in-laws, cousin, niece, nephew, and former subordinates established the Chengdu Four Communications Daily Chemical Trading Department.

From February to August 1988, the Chengdu Four Communications Daily Chemical Trading Department, utilizing Yang Guohui's connections, obtained 191 scarce rail cars without any cost. They shipped 11,412 tons of phosphate ore to the Laiwu Sulfuric Acid Plant in Shandong, with a total transaction amount of 1,038,000 yuan, earning an illegal profit of 195,600 yuan. After deducting expenses such as salaries, rent, and taxes, they made a net profit of 168,100 yuan. Most of this money was distributed among the department's members, with only 628 yuan remaining in the account. Yang Guohui, although not a registered member of the company, directly participated in the operations. He made phone calls and wrote letters to his former subordinates and associates, arranged for rail cars, assisted with transportation, and facilitated cross-provincial transportation channels. Therefore, he received a salary of over 1,000 yuan under his former name, Yang Jian Sheng, and shared in the profits amounting to 120,000 yuan. His wife, Wang Yun (former deputy director of the Chengdu Railway Bureau's Trade Union Organization Department and deputy manager of the trading department), although not the legal representative of the company, held significant power and directed operations. This time, in addition to receiving a salary of over 1,000 yuan, she also shared in the profits amounting to 260,000 yuan. Yang Guohui's mother-in-law, Party Zongtao, also received 6,500 yuan.

While illegally profiting, the Chengdu Four Communications Daily Chemical Trading Department also employed various means to evade taxes. According to regulations, the trading department should have paid 21,149 yuan in business tax and 70,408 yuan in income tax for the phosphate ore. They submitted a falsified loss report and paid only 2,587 yuan in taxes, evading 88,970 yuan in taxes.

With the active assistance of the Chengdu Railway Bureau and relevant departments such as the Sichuan Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Supervision Bureau, and Industrial and Commercial Bureau, the joint investigation team, after more than four months of efforts, has basically clarified the case and handed it over to the Chengdu People's Procuratorate. Currently, various sectors in Chengdu are awaiting the outcome of this case.

    中纪委监察部铁道部联合调查
    一特大投机倒把偷税案在蓉查实
    成铁局原局长杨国辉及其亲友非法牟利数十万元
    据新华社成都7月14日电　（记者李南玲、成建）最近，由中纪委、监察部、铁道部组成的联合调查组在成都查实一起特大投机倒把、偷税案。成都铁路局原局长杨国辉及其亲友组成的成都市四通日用化工经营部，非法倒卖磷矿石等国家严格控制的物资，仅倒卖磷矿石一项就非法牟利19.56万余元。
    杨国辉是1937年参加革命、1938年入党的老干部，1979年任成都铁路局长，1985年离休。
    据调查，1987年10月，在杨国辉的参与下，他的爱人、亲家、堂弟、外甥女、侄儿、老部下等8人组建了四通日用化工经营部。
    1988年2月至8月，四通日用化工经营部利用杨国辉的各种关系，不花分文搞来紧缺的191个车皮，向山东莱芜硫酸厂发运磷矿石11412吨，总经营额为103.8万元，牟利19.56余万元，除开支工资、房租、税金等费用外，获纯利16.81余万元。这笔钱除去3.8万元用于行贿外，其余绝大部分被经营部人员分光，账上仅余628元。杨国辉虽不是公司注册人员，但他直接参与了经营活动。他给老部下、老关系打电话、写条子，并联系车皮、协助运输，疏通跨省运输渠道。因此，他也以他的曾用名杨建生从经营部实领工资1000多元，分得盈利1.2万元。他的妻子王蕴（成都铁路局工会组织部原副部长、经营部副经理）虽不是公司法人代表，但实权在握，坐镇指挥。这次除领取1000多元工资外，还分得盈利2.6万元。杨国辉的亲家母党宗桃也分得6500元。
    在非法牟利的同时，四通日用化工经营部还千方百计偷税。按照规定，经营部经营的磷矿石应缴纳营业税21149元、所得税70408元。他们采取出具伪造亏损报告等手段，仅缴纳税金2587元，偷税88970元。
    联合调查组在成都铁路局和四川省纪委、监察厅、工商局等有关部门的积极协助下，经过4个多月的努力，此案已基本查清，并已移交成都市人民检察院。目前，成都各界对此案如何处理正拭目以待。
