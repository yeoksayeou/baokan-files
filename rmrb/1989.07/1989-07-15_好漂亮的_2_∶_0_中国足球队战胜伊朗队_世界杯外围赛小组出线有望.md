A Beautiful 2:0 Victory: China's Football Team Defeats Iran
World Cup Qualifying Group Stage Exit in Sight

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 15th - Reporter Wang Dazhao reports: China's football team won a beautiful 2:0 victory over Iran, giving the Shenyang fans, who had been holding their breath for so many days, a pleasant surprise.

After thorough preparation, China's football team, despite some initial chaos, gradually stabilized and organized a series of threatening attacks. In the 30th minute of the first half, Iran's number 13, Kolmani, headed the ball off the post. China quickly counterattacked, with Ma Lin, Wang Baoshan, Tang Yaodong, and Jia Xiuquan taking turns shooting, opening up the situation. In the 29th minute of the second half, China, which had been in control of the game, finally scored. Number 2, Zhu Bo, assisted from the baseline and crossed the ball. Number 9, Liu Haiguang, in a header duel with the opponent's tall defender, headed the ball into the net off the post. A few minutes later, Zhu Bo repeated his trick, and number 15, Zhang Xiaowen, rushed from the left side, flying in with a header to score another goal.

On July 22nd, the two teams will face off in Tehran for the second round. Since China still has one more match against the weak Thai team, they have taken the initiative in the fight for the World Cup qualifying group stage exit.

    好漂亮的2∶0
    中国足球队战胜伊朗队
    世界杯外围赛小组出线有望
    本报沈阳7月15日电  记者汪大昭报道：中国足球队2∶0战胜伊朗队，打了个漂亮仗，连憋了多少天的沈阳球迷们也没想到赢得如此痛快。
    经过充分准备的中国足球队在开场一阵忙乱后，逐渐站稳阵脚，组织起颇具威胁的进攻。上半时第30分钟左右，伊朗队13号科尔马尼一记头攻从门柱上弹出。中国队迅即反击，马林、王宝山、唐尧东、贾秀全轮番攻门，将局面打开。下半时第29分钟，一直掌握着场上主动权的中国队终于有了收获，2号朱波助攻到底线后传中，9号柳海光在门前同对方高大后卫“空战”中，将球顶到门柱上折入网内。几分钟后，朱波故伎重施，15号张小文从左侧赶上，飞身头攻，再得1分。
    7月22日，中伊两队将在德黑兰作第二回合较量。由于中国队还有最后迎战缺乏实力的泰国队一场垫底，在争夺世界杯外围赛小组出线权中取得了主动。
