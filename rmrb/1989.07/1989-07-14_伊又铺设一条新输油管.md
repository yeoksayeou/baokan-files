Iraq has completed the construction of another new oil pipeline, which will soon enter the trial operation phase and is expected to be officially put into use in September this year. This pipeline runs from Iraq through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea, with a daily oil transport capacity of 800,000 barrels. The use of the new pipeline will further increase Iraq's oil export volume.

    伊拉克又一条新输油管道已铺设完成，近期内将投入试运行，预计今年9月正式使用。这条管道由伊拉克经沙特通往红海，日输油量为80万桶。新油管的使用进一步提高了伊拉克的石油出口量。
