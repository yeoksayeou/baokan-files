Xinhua News Agency, Kuwait, July 14th.

Sudan's Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation issued a special statement today, denying rumors that the council's chairman and prime minister, Omar al-Bashir, had agreed to allow South Sudan to secede in order to end the six-year civil war.

The council's spokesperson issued the special statement to the Saudi Arabian newspaper *Al-Yawm*. The statement, published on July 14th, said that these rumors are "groundless and do not reflect the facts." The statement emphasized that the new Sudanese government has consistently advocated for "national unity and a comprehensive solution to the South Sudan issue."

The United Arab Emirates' *Gulf News* reported on July 13th that the new Sudanese leadership had stated that if the residents of South Sudan decided to secede, the government would not object.

The statement also said that the new Sudanese government has its own views on how to peacefully resolve the South Sudan issue. Neither the council's chairman nor any other members of the council would agree to the country's division. Currently, the new Sudanese government leaders' contacts with the opposition forces' representatives "are aimed at achieving a fundamental solution, not discussing how to make the South secede."

    苏丹新政府声明
    否认同意南部与国家脱离
    新华社科威特7月14日电  苏丹救国革命指挥委员会今天发表特别声明，否认关于该委员会主席兼总理巴希尔允许苏丹南部脱离国家，以结束6年内战的传闻。
    革命指挥委员会发言人对沙特阿拉伯《今天》日报发表了特别声明。该报14日刊载的这项声明说，这些传闻是“没有根据的和不符合事实的”。声明指出，苏丹新政权一直坚持争取“国家团结和南部苏丹问题的广泛解决”。
    阿拉伯联合酋长国的《海湾日报》13日曾报道说，苏丹新领导人表示，如果苏丹南部的居民决定脱离国家，政府将不予反对。
    这项声明还说，苏丹新政府对如何和平解决南部苏丹问题有自己的看法，无论是委员会主席还是委员会的其他成员都不会同意国家的分裂。目前，苏丹新政府领导人同反政府军代表的接触“是为了取得问题的根本解决，而不是商量如何使南部脱离国家”。
