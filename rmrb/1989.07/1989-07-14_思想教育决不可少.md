While carrying out the construction of material civilization, why is it necessary to focus on the construction of spiritual civilization? The tragedy of Luojiaslope Village after it became wealthy shows that neglecting ideological education is absolutely unacceptable.

Looking at the fact that Luojiaslope Village has transformed from poverty to wealth over the past decade, one indeed feels happy. This shows how wise and correct the Party's reform and opening-up policies are, and we must steadfastly follow this path.

If one only sees the wealthy households in Luojiaslope Village, living in affluence and prosperity, everyone would nod in approval. After all, the ultimate goal of building socialism is to improve people's lives.

However, when one looks at the spiritual state of the wealthy people in Luojiaslope Village, it is heartbreaking. For the sake of money, they resort to any means necessary: once they have money, they indulge in extravagance and waste it recklessly; when society needs help for the needy and encouragement for good deeds, they cling to their wealth and refuse to give even a penny. Their greatest tragedy is that they have become slaves to money.

Socialist construction includes both material civilization and spiritual civilization, and the two are inseparable. To build material civilization well, one must also focus on building spiritual civilization, which means adapting to the needs of the Four Modernizations, improving people's quality, and cultivating socialist citizens who have ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. People with lofty ideals and aspirations will have self-respect and self-confidence, be able to consider the bigger picture and the overall situation rather than being shortsighted and petty; with good moral standards, they can develop new interpersonal relationships in collective life and benefit others rather than harming them; with a strong sense of policy and law, they can uphold the law, work diligently to get rich, rather than being unscrupulous and lawless.

The key issue now is that to ensure the implementation of the reform and opening-up policies, we must focus on ideological education. If one becomes wealthy economically but forgets the Party's reform and opening-up policies and deviates from the Party's leadership, one will deviate from the socialist direction and go astray.

### 思想教育决不可少

    思想教育决不可少
    在进行物质文明建设的同时，为什么必须抓好精神文明建设？罗家坡村致富后的悲剧说明，忽视思想教育工作是绝对不行的。
    看看罗家坡村十年间由穷变富的事实，确实令人高兴。它说明，党的改革开放方针政策是多么的英明正确，我们必须沿着这条路坚定不移地走下去。
    如果只看罗家坡村富裕户财大气粗、日子过得红火牛气劲，谁都会点头称道。因为，我们搞社会主义建设的最终目的还是要人们生活得更好。
    然而，再看看罗家坡村腰缠万贯人的精神面貌，不能不令人痛心。他们为了钱，可以不择手段：他们手里有了钱，便花天酒地，胡花乱用；当社会需要扶危济困、助人为乐时，他们却爱财如命，分文不舍。他们的最大悲剧，就是成了金钱的奴隶。社会主义建设，包含着物质文明建设和精神文明建设，二者是不可分离的。要搞好物质文明的建设，必须同时抓好精神文明建设，也就是说要适应四化建设的需要，提高人的素质，培养有理想、有道德、有文化、有纪律的社会主义公民。人们有了远大的理想和抱负，就有了自尊心和自信心，就能胸怀全局、顾全大局而不是鼠目寸光、斤斤计较；有了良好的道德风尚，就能在共同生活中发展新型的人际关系，造福于人而不是祸害于人；有了较强的政策法制观念，就能奉公守法、勤劳致富，而不是见利忘义、违法乱纪。
    现在的重要问题是，要保证改革开放方针政策的实行，必须抓好人的思想教育工作，如果经济上富裕了，忘了党的改革开放方针政策，离开党的领导，就会偏离社会主义方向，走到错误的道路上去。
