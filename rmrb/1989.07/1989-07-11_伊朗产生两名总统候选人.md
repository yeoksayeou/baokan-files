Iran's presidential election will be held on July 28. In addition to Speaker Rafsanjani, there is currently one other qualified presidential candidate.

The Islamic Republic News Agency of Iran quoted Yazdi, the head of the Iranian Presidential Election Committee, as saying on July 10 that the other 77 presidential candidates do not have the qualifications to run.

Rafsanjani's challenger is named Abbas Shabani, who is 58 years old. He is a doctor trained in France and is currently a member of parliament.

Analysts believe that Shabani does not pose a threat to Rafsanjani, who had been the only presidential candidate before this.

    新华社德黑兰7月10日电　伊朗总统选举将在28日举行，除议长拉夫桑贾尼外，目前还有1名合格的总统候选人。
    伊朗伊斯兰共和国通讯社10日援引伊朗总统选举委员会负责人亚兹迪的话说，另外77名总统候选人没有竞选的资格。
    拉夫桑贾尼的这位挑战者名叫阿巴斯·沙巴尼，今年58岁。他是法国培养的医生，目前是议会议员。
    分析家认为，沙巴尼对在此之前一直是唯一总统候选人的拉夫桑贾尼不构成威胁。
