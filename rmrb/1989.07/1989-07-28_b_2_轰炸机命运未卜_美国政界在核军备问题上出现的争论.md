Recently, the United States' latest strategic bomber, the B-2 Stealth Bomber, successfully completed a two-and-a-half-hour test flight in California. While the maiden flight appeared successful, the U.S. Congress sparked heated debates over the 1990 budget allocation for the B-2 bomber. The future of the Pentagon's B-2 bomber production plan remains uncertain.

The reasons for the controversy surrounding the B-2 bomber can be summarized as follows: Firstly, the cost is too high. According to the Department of Defense, the U.S. plans to establish a strategic force consisting of 132 B-2 bombers, but the cost is enormous, totaling $70 billion. In the first 10 years, the military spent over $20 billion on the development of this aircraft. The next 7 years are planned to allocate $50 billion for procurement, making each B-2 bomber cost $5.3 billion. Such a high cost is unprecedented, and people are greatly surprised. However, the Bush administration, in order to promote this plan, advocates starting procurement from the 1990 fiscal year and proposes allocating $47 billion for it. The government's proposal immediately faced criticism in Congress. The Senate and the House of Representatives recently passed resolutions to reduce this budget, with the House of Representatives proposing to reduce the B-2 bomber's budget for the next fiscal year from $47 billion to $37 billion and limit the government to purchasing no more than 2 aircraft next year.

Secondly, Congress is uncertain about the performance of the B-2 bomber. The B-2 bomber was developed under high secrecy, and its performance is little known. Although the air force personnel in charge of the development repeatedly lobbied, claiming that the B-2 bomber has the ability to penetrate high-altitude air defenses, avoid radar, and enter enemy territory, and can execute nuclear retaliation missions if necessary, "it can maintain effective strategic capabilities." However, this alone is not enough to convince the members of Congress. The resolutions passed by both houses of Congress require continued testing of the B-2 bomber, and only when it is proven to have good performance and can fulfill its mission can it be procured.

Thirdly, there are differing opinions on the production scale of the B-2 bomber. The government's stance is that, to maintain the modernization of the U.S. strategic deterrent force, a new strategic bomber force needs to be built in the 1990s, and its quantity cannot be small. However, Congress's intention is to reduce spending as much as possible and shrink the production scale. Some members believe that other weapons can also complete the tasks of the B-2 bomber and advocate reducing the number of B-2 bombers from the government's original plan to 60.

The debate surrounding the B-2 bomber is far from over, and it is unlikely that there will be a clear conclusion in the short term. However, it seems that the government's plan is unlikely to proceed smoothly as originally planned. While Congress has raised objections on budget, performance, and production scale, it does not mean that it completely rejects the B-2 plan. Strategic bombers are a part of the U.S.'s triad nuclear strategic force. Maintaining the modernization of the strategic force remains a fundamental policy for the U.S. to maintain its military strength, and this point has not changed due to the current debate. However, this debate indicates that, as U.S.-Soviet relations improve, nuclear talks are underway, and the U.S. faces financial constraints and relatively reduced military spending, differing views and proposals on arms issues in the U.S. political arena are inevitable. This will, to some extent, affect future U.S. military decision-making.

    B—2轰炸机命运未卜
    ——美国政界在核军备问题上出现的争论
    本报记者　张启昕
    不久前，美国最新式的战略轰炸机B—2隐形轰炸机在加利福尼亚州试飞两个半小时，首航似已成功，但美国国会在本周辩论1990年度B—2轰炸机预算拨款时，却引起了激烈的争论。五角大楼制订的B—2轰炸机生产计划未来的命运如何，目前尚难预料。
    B—2轰炸机引起争论的原因，概括起来有三：一是造价太高。按照国防部的计划，美国打算建立一支拥有132架B—2轰炸机的战略力量，但耗资巨大，总共需要700亿美元。前10年，军方为研制这种飞机花费200多亿美元，今后7年则计划拨款500亿美元进行采购，因此每架B—2轰炸机造价高达5.3亿美元。这样高的造价前所未有，人们大为惊讶。但布什政府为推行这一计划，力主从1990财政年度开始陆续采购，并提出下一年度为之拨款47亿美元。政府提出的要求立即在国会遭到非议，参议院、众议院近日分别通过决议，对此预算进行削减，其中众议院主张把下年度B—2轰炸机的经费从47亿美元减少到37亿美元，并限制政府明年至多采购2架。
    二是国会对B—2轰炸机的性能如何难以肯定。B—2轰炸机是在高度保密的情况下研制出来的，其性能鲜为人知。虽然主持研制的空军人士一再游说，B—2轰炸机具有高度穿透空防的能力，能够避开雷达，深入对方境内，一旦需要可以执行向对方进行核报复的任务，“能够保持有效的战略作用”。但仅此难以使议员们信服，国会两院通过的决议都要求继续对B—2轰炸机进行试验，只有在确实证明其性能良好，能够胜任其使命时才能采购。
    三是对B—2轰炸机的生产规模意见不一。政府方面的主张是，为了保持美国战略威慑力量现代化，需要在90年代新建一支战略轰炸机力量，其数量不能少，而国会的意向是尽量减少开支，缩小生产规模。有的议员则认为其他武器同样能完成B—2轰炸机的任务，主张把B—2轰炸机的数量从政府的原计划减少到60架。
    目前围绕B—2轰炸机的争论远未结束，预计在短期内也不会有明确结论。但看来，政府的计划不大可能顺利地按照原样进行，而国会虽然在经费、性能和生产规模上提出异议，却并不说明它全盘否定B—2计划。战略轰炸机是美国三位一体战略核力量的组成部分，保持战略力量现代化仍是美国保持军事实力所遵循的基本方针，这点并未因当前的争论而有改变。然而这场争论表明，在美苏关系有所改善、核谈判正在进行以及在美国财政开支拮据、军费相对减少的情况下，美国政界在军备问题上出现不同看法和主张又是不可避免的。这在一定程度将会影响到今后美国的军事决策。
