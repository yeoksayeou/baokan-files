    Rectifying the Market for Petroleum Products

    In recent years, the management and circulation of petroleum products have been chaotic. Some units and individuals have blindly opened gas stations.

    Along the roads from Zhengzhou to Xuchang, there are at least dozens of gas stations. Particularly between Zhengzhou and Xinzhen County, many villages and towns can be described as having "gas stations everywhere." Currently, petroleum products are in short supply, but these gas stations have ample supplies of gasoline and diesel. I have seen that the storage conditions of many gas stations are quite primitive. A small wooden shed with a few oil drums is all it takes for the oil boss to start his business. Some gas stations are just a wall away from restaurants, lacking both safety facilities and fire prevention equipment, posing a serious threat to the social safety of villages and towns. I suggest that relevant departments take measures to seriously rectify the existing petroleum markets in various places.

### 整顿石油成品油市场

    整顿石油成品油市场
    近几年来，石油成品油销售管理和流通环节混乱，一些单位和个人盲目开办加油站。
    郑州至许昌的道路两旁，至少有几十家加油站，尤其是郑州至新郑县之间，不少村镇可以说是加油站“林立”。目前，石油成品油十分紧缺，但是，这些加油站汽油、柴油却很充足。我看见不少加油站的储备条件十分简陋。一间小木房，放上几只油桶，油老板就开始经营了。有的加油站与饭店仅一墙之隔，既无安全设施，又无防火设备，严重危及村镇的社会安全。建议有关部门采取措施，认真整顿各地现有石油市场。
