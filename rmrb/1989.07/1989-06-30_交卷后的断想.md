I participated in the Liberation War that decided China's fate. The three-plus years of combat life seemed so long, yet it passed so quickly. I miss that period of combat life. I miss the revolutionary spirit of my comrades-in-arms, who fearlessly charged forward, endured hardships, and were willing to sacrifice themselves; I miss the democratic style of the officers and soldiers who were united as one; I miss their exemplary actions of putting hardships first and enjoyment last, and their fine traditions of hard work and simplicity; I miss the enthusiasm of the people in the old revolutionary base areas who "pushed victory forward with small carts" and the deep bond of kinship between the military and the people, sharing life and death together.

Today, although we have completed the film "Perpetual Kunlun," I still feel that the historical mission has not been fully accomplished. I am not someone who indulges in nostalgia for the past. However, as we enter a new historical period today, what spirit will we use to build the Four Modernizations? And what is the purpose of building the Four Modernizations? If this film can inspire viewers—old comrades who have gone through the war and young friends—to think about something, it would be my sincere wish.

Recently, when discussing the Peking opera "Borrowing Arrows with a Straw Boat" with a friend, I was once again impressed by the vivid and lively portrayal of the characters Zhu Geliang, Zhou Yu, and Lu Su. The brilliance lies in the author's ability to depict these three characters with such distinct and vivid personalities. Many Chinese operas have achieved success and been passed down through the generations because they have created characters with distinct personalities.

I believe that in inheriting our nation's excellent cultural traditions, we must learn from the ancient masters' skill in portraying characters.

In the film "Perpetual Kunlun," we devoted a great deal of effort to portraying the artistic images of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, and other revolutionary leaders of the older generation. They are not only great figures who command respect, but also ordinary people with joys, sorrows, loves, and hates. Our goal is to portray these great figures as real people.

I sincerely hope that the audience will acknowledge the film when it is released, although there are still some regrets that can serve as lessons.

1988 was the year of entertainment films. Their waves have surged into this year. Among the filmmakers, there are such words: making entertainment films is to restore the entertainment function of films; making entertainment films is to solve the problem of financial difficulties, otherwise the studios will find it hard to survive...

I support the production of high-quality, healthy entertainment films. They are a flower in the garden of arts. The audience enjoys watching entertainment films.

With the rise of entertainment films, will serious art films be neglected?

The film "Perpetual Kunlun" has been previewed among audiences of different cultural backgrounds.

The first screening had more than 80% of the audience consisting of old comrades. At the beginning, when they heard that the film would be nearly three hours long, some were concerned about whether they could watch it to the end. However, they did watch it to the end and said: "These three hours passed so quickly."

The second screening had more than 80% of the audience consisting of young people. This time, I was a bit worried about whether they could watch it to the end. I sat in the last row of the theater, ready to leave with the majority if they decided to. However, I stayed with the audience until the end. Although there were a few who left, it was a very small number.

The film "Perpetual Kunlun" stirred the hearts of the old comrades and touched the hearts of the young friends. From this, I deeply understand that art must truly reflect life; art must also portray real people.

    交卷后的断想
    电影《巍巍昆仑》总导演　郝光
    我参加过决定中国命运的解放战争。三年多的战斗生活，是那么漫长，又是那么迅疾的走过来了。
    我怀念那段战斗生活。怀念战友们前赴后继，不怕疲劳，不怕牺牲的革命精神；怀念指战员与战士打成一片的民主作风以及他们吃苦在前、享受在后的模范行动和艰苦朴素的优良传统；怀念老区乡亲们“用小车把胜利推出来”的支前热情和军民团结、生死与共的骨肉之情……。
    今天，虽然拍摄了《巍巍昆仑》，但总感到历史的使命尚未很好的完成。
    我不是沉湎过去的怀旧者。然而，在跨入一个新的历史时期的今天，我们用什么精神建设四化？建设四化又是为了什么？如果能引起看过这部影片的观众——从战争走过来的老同志和青年朋友们联想点什么，将是我的良好愿望。
    近来与友人谈起京剧《草船借箭》时，又一次被剧中塑造的诸葛亮、周瑜、鲁肃三个艺术形象所折服。使人叫绝之处是作者把这三个人物的性格刻画得那么鲜明、生动。中国的戏曲有很多剧目是由于塑造了有性格的人物而取得成功，流传今世。
    我想，在继承民族的优秀文化传统中，古人刻划人物性格的一绝应是必学之课。
    影片《巍巍昆仑》在塑造毛泽东、周恩来、任弼时等老一辈革命家的艺术形象时，花了很大气力。他们既是叱咤风云的伟大人物，又是与普通人一样有喜怒哀乐和爱憎好恶活生生的人。我们的追求就是把这些伟人塑造成真实的人。
    我热诚地希望影片放映时会得到观众的承认。虽然还有引为教训的遗憾之笔。
    1988年是娱乐片大潮。她掀起的波涛已涌向今年。在弄潮中有这样的话语：拍娱乐片是为了使电影的娱乐功能回归；拍娱乐片是为了解决囊中匮乏，否则制片厂将难生活……
    我赞成拍高尚、健康的娱乐片。她是百花园中的一朵。观众喜欢看娱乐片。
    娱乐片的兴起，严肃的艺术片会不会被冷落？
    《巍》片曾分别在两种不同文化层次的观众中试映过。
    第一场，80％以上的观众是老同志。开始当他们听到影片要放映近三个小时，有的人担心能否看到底。结果他们看到底了，并且说：这三个小时过的真快。
    第二场，80％以上的观众是青年人。这次，我有些担心他们能否看到底？我坐在剧场最后一排，准备随时跟着多数人退场。然而我陪着观众看到底了。虽然也有走的，那是极少数。
    《巍》片搅动了老同志的心，也拨动了青年朋友的心。由此深知，艺术必须真实地反映生活；艺术也必须塑造真实的人。
