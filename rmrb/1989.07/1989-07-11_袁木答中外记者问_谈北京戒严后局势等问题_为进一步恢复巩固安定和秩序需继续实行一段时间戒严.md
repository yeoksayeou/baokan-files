Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 11th.

At a press conference held by the Chinese Journalists Association today, Yuan Mu, the spokesperson for the State Council, reported on China's economic situation in the first half of the year and answered several questions from domestic and foreign journalists.

**American Wall Street Journal Reporter:** Continuing martial law in Beijing will definitely affect foreign economic relations and scare away foreigners. Why does the Chinese government impose martial law in Beijing, and when will it be lifted?

**Yuan Mu:** The Chinese government had to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing because of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots that occurred there. Although we have achieved a decisive victory in suppressing the riots, this struggle is not yet over. A few counter-revolutionary rioters are unwilling to accept their defeat, and some weapons and ammunition that were stolen are still scattered in society, which could cause problems at any time and affect social stability. Continuing martial law is to further maintain and restore the stability of the capital, ensure the safety of citizens' lives and property, ensure that government agencies can perform their duties normally, and also ensure the safety of foreign friends who come to China and Beijing to do business, establish enterprises, conduct economic and technological exchanges, and engage in friendly visits and tourism. They can carry out various business activities normally. I believe that as people gradually understand the truth about the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the doubts of foreign friends who had various doubts will gradually decrease. Continuing martial law in certain areas of Beijing for a period of time will be beneficial to the further stabilization of social order, beneficial to expanding opening up to the outside world, and beneficial to the recovery of the tourism industry and the development of foreign trade, rather than the opposite.

I would like to explain again that China's imposition of martial law in certain areas of the capital means implementing special security measures in some key departments and transportation routes. This is different from "martial law" and does not mean that China has lost control of the situation. The martial law troops, under the command of the State Council, work together with the armed police and public security personnel to perform two main tasks: one is to further suppress the turmoil and riots; the other is to do everything possible to maintain normal social order. I believe that as people's fear gradually subsides, the misunderstanding of martial law will also disappear.

**Xinhua News Agency Reporter:** Currently, foreign investors have a lot of capital, and China's import and export deficit is expanding. What impact will this have on the peak of foreign debt repayment in the 1990s? Also, last time you said that during the suppression of the riots, the number of deaths among soldiers and civilians was roughly equal, but Chen Xitong recently said in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress that the number of soldiers killed was in the tens. Which number is accurate?

**Yuan Mu:** Regarding the first question, in the second half of this year and in the coming years, China will resolutely take measures to achieve a rough balance in import and export trade. The situation of excessive imports needs to be controlled. We have fully considered the issue of the peak of foreign debt repayment in our economic decision-making. The State Council will take necessary measures to deal with this situation. I would also like to point out that China's current foreign debt has not exceeded our ability to repay it. China repays foreign debt with integrity.

Regarding the number of deaths during the riots, my statement was made shortly after the counter-revolutionary riots occurred, and at that time, some situations had not been and could not be fully clarified. The number of deaths reported by Comrade Chen Xitong on June 30th was based on further investigation and understanding and is a more accurate figure.

**American Cable News Network Reporter:** What will the government do if farmers are unwilling to sell grain to the government at the prices set by the government?

**Yuan Mu:** Regarding this issue, my assessment of the extent may differ from yours. Indeed, due to the existence of two grain prices, selling grain and other agricultural products to the state at the contract purchase price will reduce some income for farmers, so some farmers may be reluctant, but this situation only occurs in a very small number of people. The fact is that the grain contract procurement tasks we require to complete each year are still completed on time. The summer harvest situation is good this year, and there will not be a situation where a large number of farmers are unwilling to deliver grain according to the contract. On the contrary, farmers across the country are enthusiastically delivering summer grain to the state. For the very few farmers who are unwilling to deliver grain at the contract price, through strengthening education and persuasion, they can also accept it. Our country's farmers have a tradition of enthusiastically delivering patriotic grain to the state, and they will act in the interests of the state as a whole. In addition to educating farmers on their duty to the state, the state also provides economic measures such as allocating subsidized fertilizers, pesticides, and other agricultural production materials to make them realize that they should adopt the correct attitude of delivering agricultural products according to the contract in the relationship between farmers and the state.

**Associated Press Reporter:** The Chinese government has repeatedly told foreign investors and tourists that imposing martial law in Beijing is to ensure their safety. Now there is a contradiction: on the one hand, it is said that everything in Beijing has returned to normal, and on the other hand, it is said that rioters have guns and may cause problems at any time. Which statement is correct?

**Yuan Mu:** I don't think your question is contradictory. Because of the turmoil and riots that occurred in Beijing, we have to impose martial law in certain areas. If we don't do this, then the counter-revolutionary rioters will overthrow our state power and put the capital in a state of white terror. Where would there be normal order? Where would there be the safety of people's lives and property? Where would there be opening up to the outside world? Where would there be the safety of foreign institutions in Beijing? It is precisely because of this that we impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing. Because this riot has been brewing for a long time, there are still remnants, so martial law cannot be lifted for the time being. Therefore, it is not lifted, and the purpose is precisely to further restore and consolidate the stability and normal order of the capital.

**Federal Republic of Germany Television Reporter:** In the Federal Republic of Germany, many companies and investors have made the decision: they will not come to China to conduct trade and investment until the martial law in Beijing is lifted. Because they think that only without martial law is safe. When will the martial law be lifted?

**Yuan Mu:** First of all, I would like to ask this reporter to convey to those who made such a decision to reconsider whether this is wise. I personally think that this is not very wise. Because after the imposition of martial law, the order in Beijing is gradually returning to normal. Of course, the continuation of martial law is for a limited period, but when it will be lifted depends on the development of the situation. If all aspects of the order are completely restored to normal and all problems that need to be solved are solved, then the martial law will be lifted, but it cannot be announced now.

Here, I would like to add that all governments, individuals, and various groups that want to maintain friendly relations with China, carry out economic and trade exchanges, and develop tourism between us should not use whether certain areas of Beijing are under martial law as a prerequisite for continuing to deal with China.

**Agence France-Presse Reporter:** I also have a contradictory question. The student movement once proposed slogans to overthrow Li Peng and Deng Xiaoping, but they did not mention overthrowing Zhao Ziyang. However, Zhao Ziyang was overthrown, while Li Peng and Deng Xiaoping were not. This is a contradiction. So in my view, this contradiction actually exists within the party, within the government, rather than within the people.

**Yuan Mu:** Comrade Zhao Ziyang committed serious errors in supporting turmoil and splitting the party in the highest leadership of our party, and therefore, through our party's legal and democratic procedures, his position was removed. This is not the same concept as what you said or what people generally say "overthrow." He committed serious errors and was removed from his position by our party. Students in the process of the student movement were used by a few plotters who created turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots to propose overthrowing this and that, and in the process of turmoil and riots, they wanted to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and overthrow the socialist system. This is completely different from the students' initial demands in the student movement to hope that the party and the government would correct their mistakes and shortcomings, promote democracy, promote the rule of law, and deepen reforms, etc. The facts have proven that the majority of students may not have thought that they would be used by a few people to go to the opposite of their initial wishes when they started the student movement.

**Vietnam News Agency Reporter:** Will Zhao Ziyang be held legally responsible? How many leaders of "Beida Autonomous Federation" and "Workers' Autonomous Federation" have been arrested so far?

**Yuan Mu:** The issue of Comrade Zhao Ziyang is currently being handled as a party matter. His case is still under investigation. The errors he committed are party matters, supporting turmoil and splitting the party. It is first handled within the party by removing his position. After further investigation, what kind of problem it is will be handled according to the principle of seeking truth from facts and adhering to the law.

Some leaders of the illegal organizations "Beida Autonomous Federation" and "Workers' Autonomous Federation" that instigated turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots have been arrested, and some have fled. Regarding some people, certain forces, including some foreigners and certain foreign forces, helping them to flee, they have done some things that we are not happy with. I express regret about this. As for how many people have been arrested and how many have fled abroad, I'm sorry, I cannot provide you with accurate figures at the moment.

**China Daily Reporter:** What impact will economic sanctions by the United States, Western Europe, and other countries have on China?

**Yuan Mu:** From a short-term perspective, the so-called "sanctions" imposed by the United States and a few Western European countries on China's economy will bring us some temporary troubles. However, the Chinese people will not yield to these so-called "sanctions" because of these troubles. On the contrary, from a long-term perspective, their actions will further stimulate the Chinese people's spirit of hard work and self-reliance. I think this spirit will be more beneficial to the development of China's economy in the fundamental sense. Of course, after saying the above, it is still necessary to make it clear that the Chinese government and the Chinese people will not change China's policy of reform and opening up because some countries have adopted some short-sighted policies towards our country. We will continue to implement reform and opening up. This opening up includes the Western world, socialist countries, developing countries, and the Third World. In short, it is opening up to all countries in the world. This policy will not change.

**American Reporter:** Recently, the crackdown on corruption is consistent with the students' initial demands. Is it to respond to their demands? Second question, please explain why there are so many corruption cases within the Chinese government and the Communist Party?

**Yuan Mu:** The Communist Party of China and the Chinese government will always firmly overcome some existing corruption within itself, and this is not because students raised the issue. Before the students raised the issue, the party and the government have been advocating this. Of course, the students and other sectors of society raised this issue in the early stages of the student movement, which made us more calmly realize that the masses are indeed very dissatisfied with this problem of the party and the government. Therefore, we need to accelerate the process of cracking down on some corruption within the party and the government, and the measures need to be more decisive, and the process needs to be further accelerated. The Chinese party is a party that serves the people wholeheartedly, and the Chinese government is also a government that serves the people wholeheartedly. In general, I do not agree with the view that the Chinese party and government have become so corrupt that they cannot be rectified, but the problem is quite serious. If you ask this reporter what caused some corruption, it is not something that can be explained in this short meeting. But one point, I would like to take this opportunity to say. The reason why our previous anti-corruption efforts were not so effective is inseparable from the errors committed by our former General Secretary Comrade Zhao Ziyang on this issue. He publicly advocated the view that corruption is inevitable in the initial stage of developing a commodity economy. Therefore, he relaxed party building, relaxed ideological education, and relaxed the requirements for party members and government officials. This made us not achieve the expected results in the work of cracking down on corruption, and this is also an important aspect of his errors.

    袁木答中外记者问
    谈北京戒严后局势等问题
    为进一步恢复巩固安定和秩序需继续实行一段时间戒严
    新华社北京7月11日电　在中国记协今天举行的记者招待会上，国务院发言人袁木在通报了我国上半年的经济情况后，回答了中外记者提出的一些问题。
    美国华尔街日报记者：在北京继续实行戒严肯定会影响对外经济联系，把外国人吓跑。请问中国政府为什么要在北京实行戒严，什么时候取消？
    袁木：中国政府之所以不得不在北京部分地区实行戒严，是因为北京发生了动乱和反革命暴乱。现在我们虽然已经取得了平息暴乱的决定性胜利，但这场斗争还没有结束。极少数反革命暴徒还不甘心他们的失败，一些被抢的枪支弹药还散失在社会上，随时还有可能出现这样那样的问题，影响社会稳定。继续实行戒严是为了进一步维护和恢复首都的安定，保障公民的生命财产安全，保障政府机关正常地执行公务，也包括保障到中国、到北京来做买卖、办企业、开展经济技术交流和进行友好访问和旅游的外国朋友的安全，保障他们能够正常地开展各种业务活动。我想，在人们越来越弄清楚北京反革命暴乱的真相以后，原来有这样那样疑虑的外国朋友，他们的疑虑也会逐步减少。在北京部分地区继续实行一段时间的戒严，会有利于社会秩序的进一步稳定，有利于扩大对外开放，也有利于恢复旅游事业和对外贸易的发展，而不是相反。
    我还要再次在这里解释一下，中国在首都部分地区实行戒严，其含义就是对一些要害部门和交通要道实行一种特殊的警戒措施，这同“军管”是两个不同的概念，决不意味着中国对局势已失去了控制能力。戒严部队是根据国务院的命令协同武警部队和公安干警执行任务，主要的是两条：一是进一步平息动乱和暴乱；二是尽一切努力保障社会的正常秩序。我想，随着人们恐惧心理的逐步消除，大家对戒严的误解也会消除。
    新华社记者：现在外国投资者蓄资很多，中国进出口差额扩大，这对90年代外债偿还高峰有何影响？还有，上次你说，在平息暴乱中，军人和群众死亡人数大体各占一半，而陈希同最近在人大常委会上说军人死亡数十人，究竟哪个数字准确？
    袁木：关于第一个问题，今年下半年乃至今后若干年内，我国要坚决采取努力实现进出口贸易大体平衡的政策，进口过多的情况要加以控制。我们在经济决策中已经充分考虑到了外债还债高峰问题，国务院将采取必要的各种措施来应付这种局面。我还想说明的是，目前中国所负外债还没有超过我们能够偿还外债的能力。中国偿还外债是讲信用的。
    关于暴乱中死亡人数问题，我的讲话是在反革命暴乱刚刚发生后不久讲的，当时有些情况还没有也不可能完全弄清楚。陈希同同志6月30日讲的死亡数字，经过了进一步的调查和了解，是比较接近实际的数字。
    美国有线广播网记者：对于农民不愿意按政府所规定的价格把粮食出售给政府，政府将怎么办？
    袁木：关于这个问题，我对它在程度上的估计可能和你有所不同。确实，由于存在两种粮食价格，农民按合同收购价格把粮食等农产品卖给国家，在经济上会减少一些收入，因此会有些农民不怎么愿意，但这种情况只发生在很少数人的身上。事实是，每年我们要求完成的粮食合同订购任务还是按时完成的。今年夏收情况不错，不致于发生大批农民不愿按订购合同交售粮食的情况。相反地，各地广大农民正在踊跃向国家交售夏粮。对很少数不愿按合同价格交售粮食的农民，通过加强教育说服工作，他们也是可以接受的。我们国家的广大农民历来有踊跃向国家交售爱国粮的传统，他们是会从国家的大局出发的。另外，除了对农民进行为国家尽义务的思想教育外，国家还通过拨给平价化肥、农药和其他农业生产资料等经济手段，使他们感到在农民与国家的关系上应该采取按合同交售农产品的正确态度。
  　合众国际社记者：中国政府不断地对外国投资者、旅游者说，在北京实行戒严是为了保障他们的安全，现在有一种矛盾：一方面说北京一切秩序都恢复正常，另一方面又说暴乱分子手中有枪，随时可能发生一些问题，这两种说法哪个正确？
    袁木：我觉得你提的问题并不矛盾。由于北京发生了动乱和暴乱，所以我们要在部分地区实行戒严。如果不这样，那么反革命暴乱分子就要颠覆我们的国家政权，使首都处于白色恐怖之中，我们哪里还有什么正常的秩序，哪里还有什么人民生命财产的安全，哪里还有对外开放，哪里还有驻京外国机构的安全。正因为从这一点出发，我们才在北京部分地区实行戒严。还因为这场暴乱的发生已经酝酿了很久，现在还有残余分子，所以戒严一时还不能取消。所以不取消，目的也正是为了进一步恢复和巩固首都的安定和正常秩序。
    联邦德国电视台记者：在联邦德国有很多公司、投资者已经作出这样的决定：在北京戒严令解除之前，他们不再来中国进行贸易和投资。因为他们认为在没有戒严令的情况下，才是安全的。请问戒严令还要持续多久？
    袁木：我首先想请这位记者女士转告作出这样决定的朋友们再考虑一下，这样做是否明智。我个人认为，这样做未必十分明智。因为戒严以后，北京的秩序正在逐步恢复正常。当然，继续实行戒严是有限期的，但什么时候取消，还要看情况的发展。如果各方面秩序完全恢复正常，需要解决的事情都解决了，那戒严令是会取消的，但现在还不能宣布。
    这里我还想再说一句，一切想同中国保持友好关系、开展经济贸易往来和互相间开展旅游事业的政府、民间人士和各种群众团体，都不要以北京部分地区是否戒严作为同中国继续往来的先决条件。
    安莎社记者：我也有一个矛盾的问题，学生运动曾经提出过口号，打倒李鹏、打倒邓小平，但他们没有提到要打倒赵紫阳。但是赵紫阳反而被打倒了，李鹏、邓小平却没有，这是一个矛盾。所以在我看来，这个矛盾实际是存在在党内，存在在政府内，而不是存在在人民群众中的矛盾。
    袁木：赵紫阳同志在我们党的最高领导层当中犯了支持动乱和分裂党的严重错误，因此经过我们党的合法程序、民主的程序，撤销了他的职务，这和你所说的或一般人们所说的“打倒”不是一个概念。他是犯了严重的错误，被我们党撤销了他的职务。学生在闹学潮的过程中，被少数制造动乱以至反革命暴乱的极少数阴谋分子所利用，提出打倒这个打倒那个，以至于在动乱和暴乱的过程当中要颠覆中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度，这和学生在学潮的初期提出希望党和政府改正自己的缺点错误，推进民主，推进法制建设，深化改革等等，完全是不同的两回事。事实证明，广大的学生可能完全没有想到，他们会被少数人利用而走向了他们开始闹学潮时的愿望的反面。
    越南通讯社记者：赵紫阳是否会被追究法律责任？目前已有多少“高自联”、“工自联”的头头被逮捕？
    袁木：赵紫阳同志的问题，目前是按党内问题处理。他的问题还在继续审查。他现在犯的错误属于在党内支持动乱和分裂党的错误，是党内问题，先在党内撤销了他的职务。继续审查以后，究竟是什么性质的问题，要按以事实为依据、以法律为准绳的原则进行处理。
    策动动乱乃至反革命暴乱的非法组织“高自联”、“工自联”的一些头头，有的被逮捕了，有的跑掉了。对于有一些人、某些势力，包括某些外国人、某些外国势力，在帮助他们跑掉的事情上，做了一些我们不高兴他们做的事情，对此我表示遗憾。究竟有多少人被捕了，有多少人跑了出去，很抱歉，现在我还无法向你提供准确的数字。
    中国日报记者：美国、西欧等一些国家对中国采取经济制裁会给中国带来什么影响？
    袁木：从短期的观点看问题，美国和西欧少数国家，对中国经济上实行的所谓“制裁”是会给我们带来一些暂时的麻烦的。但是中国人民不会由于这种麻烦而屈服于这种所谓的“制裁”。相反地，从长远的观点看问题，他们这样做会更加激发起中国人民艰苦奋斗、自力更生的精神。我想这种精神对中国经济的发展，从根本上说，可能是更有利的。当然，在说了上面的话之后，还是要非常明确的说明一点，中国政府和中国人民决不会因为某些国家对我们国家采取了一些短视的政策，而改变中国实行改革开放的总方针。我们仍然要继续实行改革开放。这种开放，包括对西方世界，包括对社会主义国家，包括对发展中国家，包括对第三世界，总之是向世界一切国家开放。这个方针不会变。
    美国记者：最近的惩治腐败和学生一开始提出的要求是一致的，是不是为了响应他们的要求而这么做的。第二个问题，请你解释为什么中国政府内、共产党内会有那么多腐败现象？
    袁木：中国共产党和中国政府将始终坚定不移地克服自身存在的某些腐败现象，这并不是因为学生提出来才这样做的。学生没有提出之前，党和政府就是这样主张的。当然学生和其他各界群众在学潮初期提出这样的问题，使我们更冷静地看到群众对党和政府存在的这种问题的确很不满意。因此，我们有必要加快惩治党和政府内存在的某些腐败现象的进程，措施要更坚决，进程要进一步加快。中国的党是全心全意为人民服务的党，中国的政府也是要全心全意为人民服务的政府，就总体上说，说中国的党和政府已经腐败到了无法整治的程度，我不赞成这个观点，但问题也是相当严重的。如果说到这位记者先生问的到底是什么原因造成了某些腐败现象，那不是在这个简短的会上可以说清楚的。但有一点，我愿趁这个机会说一说。我们前一段之所以惩治腐败的效果不那么显著，和我们原来的总书记赵紫阳同志在这个问题上所犯的错误是分不开的。他就公开宣传过一种观点，说是在发展商品经济的初期，腐败是不可避免的。因此，就放松了党的建设，放松了思想教育，放松了对党员和政府工作人员的要求。这就使得我们在惩治腐败的工作中没有取得应有的效果，这也是他犯错误的一个重要方面。
