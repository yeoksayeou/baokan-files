Central leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Li Ruihuan, and Li Tieying held a symposium with some representatives of the National Conference on Higher Education Work this afternoon in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai. General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin stressed at the meeting that the leadership of higher education institutions should in the future clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization, firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, and strengthen ideological and political education for young students.

Jiang Zemin said, "The process from the student unrest to the turmoil, and then to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, was indeed shocking. This is a bad thing, but it has made us more alert. Comrade Deng Xiaoping said that our biggest mistake in recent years is in education. Initially, we did not fully realize this, but through this incident, we have come to a deeper understanding."

He said, "Many young people have been greatly influenced by Western culture and ideology in recent years, while we have relaxed our positive ideological education for them, leading to some erroneous views. They lack the necessary mental preparation for the arduous and complex nature of socialist construction and reform. Now, two fundamental issues have not been well resolved among many young people: whether socialism is better than capitalism, and why China should adhere to the leadership of the Communist Party. We must strengthen Marxist-Leninist education, both in theory and in practice, to make them truly understand that only by adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist path can our country prosper."

He emphasized the need to establish a competent ideological and political work team. Jiang Zemin also discussed how to view the issue of intellectuals in our country. He pointed out that intellectuals are part of the working class. They have worked selflessly and devoted themselves to the cause of socialist construction and reform on various fronts, truly becoming the elite of the nation. The construction of the Four Modernizations relies on them, and this cannot be shaken. The handful of people like Fang Lizhi do not represent China's intellectuals; instead, they are the dregs of Chinese intellectuals. Of course, intellectuals may have shortcomings, and we must strengthen their education and learning to improve their ideological awareness, enabling them to play a greater role in the construction of the Four Modernizations.

He pointed out that in recent years, some schools have had a serious tendency to prioritize money. Some fundraising activities are unrelated to teaching and research, and if left unchecked, they will harm the cause of education. He said that the education sector must not prioritize money. Of course, schools engaging in work-study programs and paid services related to research projects should be supported.

Jiang Zemin also pointed out that in education, we must not be self-satisfied and close ourselves off. Instead, we should boldly learn from and absorb all valuable elements from ancient and foreign education, but not in an uncritical or indiscriminate manner.

Li Peng said in his speech, "The success or failure of our schools should be measured by what standard? What is the most important thing? I think it is a firm and correct political direction, to cultivate students' love for the motherland and socialism. If we cultivate people who have good professional knowledge but do not support the socialist system and are alienated from the people, that would be a failure in our education."

He pointed out that this turmoil and rebellion have been a severe test for everyone, and everyone has shown their true colors. The Party committees of universities should seize this opportunity to build and improve the teams of cadres and activists. He said that the leadership teams of most of our universities are good, with firm stances, and only a few are unqualified. Through learning and implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, we can clarify right and wrong, raise awareness, and truly rectify the leadership teams of universities.

Li Peng said that for the problems existing among the broad masses of young students, we must strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions and focus on education, helping them to improve their understanding.

Li Ruihuan said, "The losses caused by this turmoil and rebellion are severe, and the problems left behind are many, bringing us a heavy task. We should deeply reflect on this."

He said, "To achieve the Four Modernizations, we must undoubtedly rely on science and technology and intellectuals. Universities are places where intellectuals are concentrated, and in the future, we will rely on them to cultivate talents. In this sense, how we handle the issue of universities is also an issue of how we handle the country and the future. Generally speaking, the teams of our universities are good, but we cannot deny that there are indeed many problems worth paying attention to. The two disturbances caused by bourgeois liberalization both originated from universities, which poses a question to us: how should we handle university work? We need to study this question well. Many problems that were unclear in the past may now be clearer."

Before the central leaders spoke, the responsible comrades of the State Education Commission and some responsible comrades of the provinces and university party secretaries participating in the National Conference on Higher Education Work put forward many good opinions on how to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and strengthen the ideological and political work of higher education institutions.

### 江泽民李鹏李瑞环等同高校工作会议代表座谈  对青年学生加强思想政治教育  切实整顿好高校领导班子建立一支精干的政工队伍

    江泽民李鹏李瑞环等同高校工作会议代表座谈
    对青年学生加强思想政治教育
    切实整顿好高校领导班子建立一支精干的政工队伍
    新华社北京7月14日电　中央领导同志江泽民、李鹏、李瑞环、李铁映，今天下午在中南海怀仁堂同参加全国高等学校工作会议的部分同志座谈。中共中央总书记江泽民在会上要求高等学校的领导今后要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，要理直气壮地坚持四项基本原则，对青年学生加强思想政治教育。
    江泽民说，这次由学潮到动乱，再由动乱发展到反革命暴乱的过程，可以说是惊心动魄的。这本身是件坏事，也促使我们清醒起来。他说，邓小平同志讲这几年我们最大的失误是教育，开始我们还认识不深，通过这个事件，我们进一步认识清楚了。
    他说，不少青年这几年受西方文化思想的影响很大，而我们又放松了对他们正面的思想教育，致使他们产生一些错误看法，对社会主义建设和改革的艰巨性、复杂性缺乏应有的思想准备。现在，有两个根本问题在许多青年中还没有很好解决，一个是究竟社会主义好还是资本主义好，另一个是为什么在中国要坚持共产党领导。对此，我们必须加强马列主义教育，既要讲理论，又要摆事实，使他们真正认识到，只有坚持共产党的领导，只有坚持走社会主义道路，我们的国家才能兴旺发达。要做到这一点，必须建立一支精干的思想政治工作队伍。
    江泽民还谈到了如何看待我国知识分子这支队伍的问题。他指出，知识分子是工人阶级的一部分，他们在社会主义建设和改革的各条战线忘我工作，无私奉献，真正是民族的精英。进行四化建设要依靠他们，这一点不能发生动摇。方励之一伙总是极少数，他们不能代表中国的知识分子，而恰恰是中国知识分子的败类。当然，知识分子也会存在缺点，要通过加强教育和学习，提高他们的思想认识，使他们在四化建设中发挥更大的作用。
    他指出，这几年一些学校一切向钱看的倾向是严重的。有些创收活动与教学、科研毫不相干，任其发展，必将贻误教育大业。他说，教育部门决不能搞一切向钱看，当然，学校开展勤工俭学，结合科研课题搞有偿服务，那是应该得到支持的。
    江泽民还指出，我们在教育上决不能固步自封，把自己封闭起来，相反要大胆地学习和吸取古代教育、外国教育中一切有价值的东西，当然不是无批判的学习，也不是无鉴别的“拿来”。
    李鹏在讲话中说，我们的学校办得好坏究竟以什么为标准，什么是第一位的，我认为是坚定正确的政治方向，要培养学生热爱祖国，热爱社会主义。如果我们培养的人，专业知识学得不错，但不拥护社会主义制度，与人民群众感情格格不入，那就是我们教育的失败。
    他指出，这次动乱、暴乱对每个人都是个严峻考验，每个人都有自己的表现。高校党委要抓住这个机会，建立健全干部和积极分子队伍。他说，我们高等学校的领导班子绝大多数都是好的，立场是坚定的，不合格的只是少数，要通过学习、贯彻四中全会的精神，分清是非，提高觉悟，把高校的领导班子切实整顿好。
    李鹏说，对广大青年学生中存在的问题，要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，重在教育，帮助他们提高认识。
    李瑞环说，这次动乱、暴乱造成的损失是严重的，遗留下来的问题是很多的，给我们带来的任务是很重的。对此，我们应该深入地思考。
    他说，我们要实现四个现代化，毫无疑问，必须依靠科学技术，依靠知识分子。大学是知识分子密集的地方，就未来而讲要靠他们培养人才。从这个意义上说，如何对待大学的问题，也是一个如何对待国家和未来的问题。他说，就总体来讲，我们的高等学校的队伍还是好的，但也不能否认确实存在着许多值得重视的问题。两次由于资产阶级自由化引起的动乱都来自大学，这就向我们提出一个问题，即大学工作到底怎么搞的问题。我们要好好研究这个问题。许多问题过去说不清，现在可能容易说清。
    中央领导同志讲话之前，国家教委负责同志和参加全国高等学校工作会议的一些省的负责同志和大学党委书记，就如何贯彻十三届四中全会精神，加强高等学校思想政治工作提出了许多很好的意见。
