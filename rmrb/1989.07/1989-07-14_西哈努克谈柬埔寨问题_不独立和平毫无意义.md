	Norodom Sihanouk on the Cambodian Issue: Peace Without Independence Is Meaningless

	Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, July 12th - According to today's report by the "Geneva Daily," Prince Norodom Sihanouk recently stated in an interview with the newspaper's reporter that "peace without independence is meaningless."

	Norodom Sihanouk is currently visiting France. He said that the purpose of his visit to France is to closely cooperate with the French government to make the upcoming international conference on the Cambodian issue in Paris as successful as possible. He emphasized, "As a Cambodian, a patriot, and a leader of the resistance movement, I hope my country can achieve peace, but peace without independence is meaningless."

	The prince warned Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the Phnom Penh regime not to attempt to impose an "unreasonable solution" on the Cambodian people. He said, "I know the Vietnamese and the Phnom Penh authorities. I know their stance. They are trying to prevent Cambodia from becoming an independent, neutral, and free country."

	Norodom Sihanouk also criticized Vietnam's lack of sincerity in the issue of withdrawing troops by the end of September. He pointed out that Vietnam's promise to withdraw troops is insincere because, in addition to the openly deployed Vietnamese troops, there are about 30,000 disguised Vietnamese soldiers serving in Hun Sen's army. Furthermore, there are 60,000 Vietnamese disguised as Cambodians active in various parts of Cambodia. He stressed that all these Vietnamese must withdraw from Cambodia.

	Regarding the future Cambodian government, Norodom Sihanouk criticized Hun Sen's insistence on excluding the Khmer Rouge. He emphasized that a quadripartite coalition government, including the Khmer Rouge, should be formed.

    西哈努克谈柬埔寨问题
    不独立和平毫无意义
    新华社日内瓦7月12日电　据《日内瓦报》今天报道，西哈努克亲王最近在接受该报记者采访时指出：没有独立的和平是毫无意义的。
    西哈努克目前正在法国访问。他说，他来法国的目的是要与法国政府密切合作，尽可能使即将在巴黎召开的柬埔寨问题国际会议获得成功。他强调说：“作为一名柬埔寨人，一个爱国者和抵抗运动的领袖，我希望我的国家能得到和平，但是没有独立的和平是毫无意义的”。
    这位亲王警告越南、苏联和金边政权不要试图让柬埔寨人接受一项“不合理的解决方法”。他说：“我是了解越南人和金边当局的。我知道他们的立场。他们企图阻止柬埔寨成为一个独立、中立和自由的国家。”
    西哈努克还谴责越南在今年9月底撤军问题上缺乏诚意。他指出，越南人的撤军许诺是不真诚的，因为除了公开的越南部队外，还有约3万名伪装的越南军人在洪森的军队中任职。此外，还有6万越南人伪装成柬埔寨人在柬埔寨各地活动。他强调，所有这些越南人都必须撤离柬埔寨。
    在谈到未来的柬埔寨政府时，西哈努克批评洪森坚持要排斥红色高棉。他强调应该组成一个包括红色高棉在内的四方联合政府。
