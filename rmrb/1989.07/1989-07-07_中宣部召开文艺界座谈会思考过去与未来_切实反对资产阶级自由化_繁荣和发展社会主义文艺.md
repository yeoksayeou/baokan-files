	The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee held a symposium with artists in Beijing on July 6 and 7 to discuss how to study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Deng Xiaoping's recent important speeches.

	At the symposium organized by the Propaganda Department, participants reviewed and reflected on the situation in the arts community in the previous period. They unanimously agreed that to flourish and develop socialist arts, it is necessary to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization.

	Wang Weiqing, Vice Minister of the Propaganda Department, who presided over the meeting, said: Our comrades in the arts community must seriously study the documents of the Fourth Plenum and Comrade Xiaoping's speeches, calmly reflect on the past, and calmly think about the future. The vast majority of comrades in the arts community support the Party and support socialism. Over the past decade, the broad masses of artists have done a great deal of work and achieved significant results. However, a small number of people in the arts community who insist on a bourgeois liberalization stance have spread various fallacies, causing great confusion. The bourgeois liberalization trend in the arts community is very serious and prominent, and there are profound lessons to be learned.

	Famous writer Liu Baiyu said: From the turmoil to the counter-revolutionary riot, the bloody lessons left behind are very profound. The role played by those in the arts community who insist on bourgeois liberalization in this incident is very clear. From this incident, bourgeois liberalization has the following characteristics: First, it stubbornly opposes the Four Cardinal Principles; second, it denies the revolutionary and progressive artistic traditions; third, it completely imitates Western bourgeois culture; fourth, it occupies the artistic front, using it to advocate bourgeois liberalization; fifth, it pollutes the people's spirit and corrupts the people's soul. In essence, it is to negate socialism and lead to capitalism, using ideological changes to achieve political changes.

	Famous art theorist Lin Moxuan said: The losses caused by this counter-revolutionary riot are enormous, and the lessons are very profound. Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, Comrade Xiaoping has timely put forward many important opinions on the work of theory, education, arts, and the entire ideological front, especially emphasizing the need to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization. He pointed out that the core of the Four Cardinal Principles is the Party's leadership and the socialist road. The core of bourgeois liberalization, on the other hand, is to oppose the Party's leadership and the socialist road. They are diametrically opposed. Some people in the arts community, however, resist opposing bourgeois liberalization; some of them even actively support, incite, and participate in the planning of this political turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, which is not surprising.

	Famous writer Malaxifu said: Over the years, the development of bourgeois liberalization trends in our country and the serious harm they have caused are all related to Comrade Zhao Ziyang. After Zhao Ziyang took office as the acting General Secretary, the first thing he did was to suppress the struggle against bourgeois liberalization that was then being carried out successfully and healthily across the country. He set limits and restrictions on the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, using the excuse that it was a "long-term task" to bring this serious political struggle to a halt, thus "long-term" shelving it.

	Li Xifan, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Arts and famous art critic, said: One of the main manifestations of the bourgeois liberalization trend in the arts is to almost completely negate the arts from the May Fourth Movement to the left-wing, to the Yan'an era, to the seventeen years after liberation, and even including thousands of years of tradition, advocating for complete Westernization. In recent years, how many works have reflected the socialist spirit or patriotism? We classify works into harmful, harmless, and beneficial, but writers should have a sense of mission and should not pursue harmlessness as their creative goal. The "two for" direction and the "hundred flowers" policy, of course, the "two for" direction is the guiding principle, and arts can only implement the "hundred flowers" policy under the "two for" direction. To call everything dirty, smelly, reactionary, and backward a beautiful flower is a misinterpretation of "hundred flowers blossoming."

	Wu Yuanmei, a researcher at the Institute of Foreign Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: In recent years, there have been several serious problems in the arts field: First, the non-ideological nature of arts, advocating for arts to detach from the times, reality, and history, and refusing to acknowledge that life is the source of arts. Second, the abstraction and generalization of human nature, humanism, and human value. Third, cultural nationalism and complete Westernization. Fourth, the denial of the social, directional, class, ideological, and party nature of arts.

	Liu Housheng, Vice Chairman of the Chinese Dramatists Association, linked his own process of raising ideological awareness during the turmoil and riot to discuss the correctness of the central decision and the necessity of opposing bourgeois liberalization. He said: Over the past few decades, the central leadership has always been very concerned about and cherished the development of our socialist drama industry. However, during the period when Zhao Ziyang served as the General Secretary, this concern was not seen.

	Zhang Jiong, a researcher at the Institute of Literature of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said: Since the new period, our arts have achieved considerable results, but over the years, due to the failure to seriously and consistently adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, the socialist arts front has been increasingly weakened, values are confused, right and wrong are not distinguished, and the bourgeois liberalization trend is increasingly rampant. To consolidate and develop the socialist arts front, the following aspects of work should be strengthened: First, in arts planning and investment policies, there should be some bias, and arts production should not be completely subject to market control. Second, arts creation, publishing, editing personnel and departments should, with a high sense of social responsibility and historical mission, strictly control quality. Third, Marxist arts criticism and theoretical construction should be vigorously developed.

	Meng Weizhai, President of the People's Fine Arts Publishing House, said: For a long time, there has been a big problem in the arts community: Is there a bourgeois liberalization problem in the arts community? Comrades who adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and Marxism affirm: There is; while those who oppose the Four Cardinal Principles and stubbornly adhere to and spread bourgeois liberalization ideas deny it, saying: There is not. Now, through the struggle to quell this counter-revolutionary riot, this debate has been conclusively answered by irrefutable facts. Arts are meant to educate people. Artists are educators, but educators must first be educated. For a period of time, those in the arts community who pursued bourgeois liberalization did not think they needed to receive any education. Without a Marxist worldview and arts view, how can one educate others? This lesson is profound.

	Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, attended the symposium and spoke. He said: Although the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot has achieved decisive victory, the struggle has not ended, and the tasks ahead are still arduous. The proletarian arts front must be occupied; otherwise, the bourgeoisie will inevitably occupy it. In recent years, the proletarian arts front has not expanded but shrunk. This situation is not satisfactory to both Party and non-Party cadres and the masses. This situation must be changed. We must resolutely carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization, reclaim the lost ground, and make socialist arts truly the main melody. The struggle against bourgeois liberalization must be clear-cut and decisive, while paying great attention to policy. We must unite and rely on the vast majority of people in the arts community to truly flourish socialist arts. The current priority in the arts community is to study the documents of the Fourth Plenum and Comrade Xiaoping's speeches, and on the basis of clarifying major issues, achieve a unified understanding.

	Participants in the symposium and speakers also included Wei Wei, Cheng Daixi, Zhu Ziqi, Guan Huad, Shao Yu, Jia Zuoguang, Du Gao, Shi Fangyu, Wang Xiaotang, Yu Lan, Li Xingye, Cai Ruohong, Luo Yang, Zhao Tiexin, and others. Cai Ruohong, Luo Yang, and Zhao Tiexin made written speeches.

    中宣部召开文艺界座谈会思考过去与未来
    切实反对资产阶级自由化  繁荣和发展社会主义文艺
    新华社北京7月7日电　首都部分文艺工作者7月6日、7日连续举行座谈会，座谈在文艺界如何学习、贯彻好四中全会精神和邓小平同志最近的几次重要讲话。
    在中宣部召开的文艺界座谈会上，与会同志对文艺界前一时期的状况进行了回顾与反思，一致认为要繁荣和发展社会主义文艺，必须坚持四项基本原则，切实反对资产阶级自由化。
    在座谈会上，主持会议的中宣部副部长王维澄说：我们文艺界的同志，要认真学习四中全会的文件和小平同志的讲话，冷静地思考过去，冷静地思考未来。文艺界绝大多数同志是拥护党、拥护社会主义的，十年来广大文艺工作者做了大量工作，取得了很大成绩。但是文艺界极少数坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人，散布了种种谬论，造成了很大的混乱，资产阶级自由化思潮在文艺界很严重很突出，有很深刻的经验教训值得总结。
    著名作家刘白羽说：从动乱到暴乱，所留下的血的教训是十分深刻的。文艺界坚持资产阶级自由化的人在这一事件中所扮演的角色十分明显。从这一事件来看，资产阶级自由化有这么几个特点：一是顽固地反对四项基本原则；二是否定革命的、进步的文艺传统；三是全盘照搬西方资产阶级文化；四是占领文艺阵地，借以鼓吹资产阶级自由化；五是污染人民的精神，腐蚀人民的灵魂。归根一点就是否定社会主义，导向资本主义，从意识形态的演变达到政治上的演变。
    著名文艺理论家林默涵说：这次反革命暴乱给我们造成的损失是巨大的，而教训也是十分深刻的。十一届三中全会以来，小平同志对理论、教育、文艺和整个思想战线的工作及时提出了许多重要意见，特别强调要坚持四项基本原则，要反对资产阶级自由化，指出四项基本原则的核心，是党的领导和社会主义道路。资产阶级自由化的核心恰恰就是反对党的领导，反对社会主义道路。它们是针锋相对的。而文艺界有些人，却抵制反对资产阶级自由化；其中有的人，极力支持、煽动，并且参加策划这次政治动乱和反革命暴乱，也就不奇怪了。
    著名作家玛拉沁夫说：多年来，资产阶级自由化思潮在我国的发展乃至造成严重危害，都与赵紫阳同志有关系。赵紫阳同志担任代总书记后，干的头一件事就是下手扼杀当时正在全国胜利而健康地开展的反对资产阶级自由化的斗争。他给反对资产阶级自由化的斗争划框框，下限制，进行“降温”和扭转方向。他借口反对资产阶级自由化斗争是“长期任务”，而使这场严肃的政治斗争刹车，从而“长期”地搁置起来。
    中国艺术研究院副院长、著名文艺评论家李希凡说：资产阶级自由化思潮在文艺上的一个主要表现是：把从五四到左翼、到延安时代的文艺、到解放后十七年，甚至包括几千年的传统，几乎全盘否定，主张全盘西化。近几年来，究竟有多少作品反映了社会主义精神或者爱国主义精神？我们把作品划分为有害、无害、有益，但作家应有使命感，不应以追求无害为自己的创作目的。为人民服务、为社会主义服务的“二为”方向和“双百”方针，当然是“二为”方向是主导，文艺只能在“二为”方向下贯彻“双百”方针，把什么脏的、臭的、反动的、落后的都美其名为香花，那是对“百花齐放”的谬解。
    中国社科院外国文学研究所研究员吴元迈说：这几年文艺领域存在几个严重问题：一、文艺的非意识形态化，鼓吹文艺脱离时代、现实、历史，拒绝承认生活是文艺的源泉。二、把人性、人道主义、人的价值抽象化和普遍化。三、文化上的民族虚无主义与全盘西化。四、否定文艺的社会性、倾向性、阶级性、思想性、党性。
    中国戏剧家协会副主席刘厚生联系自己在动乱和暴乱过程中思想认识转变提高的过程，谈到中央决策的正确性和反对资产阶级自由化的必要性。他说：在过去几十年中，党中央领导人一直是非常关心和爱护我国社会主义戏剧事业发展的。但是在赵紫阳同志担任总书记时期，这种关心看不到了。
    中国社科院文学所研究员张炯说：新时期以来，我们的文艺取得了较大的成绩，但多年来由于没有认真地、一贯地坚持四项基本原则，社会主义文艺阵地被削弱的情况越来越严重，价值取向混乱，是非不分，资产阶级自由化思潮日益泛滥。要巩固和发展社会主义文艺阵地，应该加强以下几方面的工作：一、文艺规划与投资政策上应有所倾斜，不能让文艺生产完全听从市场的支配。二、文艺创作、出版、编辑人员和部门都要以高度的社会责任感和历史使命感把好质量关。三、要大力发展马克思主义的文艺批评和理论建设。
    人民美术出版社社长孟伟哉说：长时间来，文艺界一直存在着一个大问题，就是文艺界有没有资产阶级自由化问题？坚持四项基本原则、坚持马克思主义的同志认定：有；而反对四项基本原则、顽固坚持和散布资产阶级自由化思想的人，却绝口否认说：没有。现在，通过平息这场反革命暴乱的斗争，这个争论已经由无可辩驳的事实作了结论。文艺是要教育人的，文艺家是教育者，但教育者必须首先受教育，而一段时间以来，文艺界搞资产阶级自由化的人，不认为自己需要接受任何教育。没有马克思主义的世界观和文艺观，怎么去教育别人。这个教训是深刻的。
    中宣部部长王忍之同志参加了座谈会并讲了话。他说：平息反革命暴乱虽然已经取得了决定性胜利，但斗争并没有结束，我们面临的任务还很艰巨。文艺阵地无产阶级不去占领，资产阶级就必然去占领。这几年无产阶级的文艺阵地不是壮大了，而是缩小了。这一点党内党外干部群众都不满意。这种状况一定要改变，我们要切实开展反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，把失去的阵地夺回来，使社会主义文艺真正成为主旋律。反对资产阶级自由化要旗帜鲜明，态度坚决，同时又要十分注意政策。要团结依靠文艺界绝大多数人，真正把社会主义文艺繁荣起来。当前文艺界首要的是学习四中全会文件和邓小平同志的讲话，在分清大是大非的基础上取得统一的认识。
    参加座谈会并发言的还有魏巍、程代熙、朱子奇、管桦、邵宇、贾作光、杜高、石方禹、王晓棠、于蓝、李兴叶等同志，蔡若虹、罗扬、赵铁信等同志作了书面发言。
