In the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing, the fight against corruption was a very prominent slogan. The vast majority of students and the masses were indignant about the phenomenon of corruption, while a few individuals with ulterior motives used the banner of fighting corruption to engage in anti-party and anti-socialist conspiracies. Their voices were louder than anyone else's, as if only by following them could China eliminate the phenomenon of corruption. This raises the question: who is the leading force in fighting corruption?

A large amount of evidence proves that the leading force in fighting corruption can only be the Communist Party of China, which serves the interests of the vast majority of the people, rather than a few individuals who promote bourgeois liberalization and create turmoil.

Everyone remembers that as early as when the Party was about to seize national power, Comrade Mao Zedong proposed at the Second Plenary Session of the Seventh Central Committee: "We must ensure that our comrades continue to maintain a humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried style of work, and we must ensure that our comrades continue to maintain the style of hard work and self-reliance." After taking power, the Party has long adhered to the education of the whole Party to resist corruption and hard work, enabling the vast majority of Party members to resist the infiltration of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets. Many old comrades still maintain the traditional style of the war years and have become models of integrity and anti-corruption. In the new situation of reform and opening up, many leading comrades of the Party Central Committee have keenly realized the phenomenon of corruption that has emerged in the process of reform and opening up, pointing out that the Party will face new severe tests, and have made a series of important instructions. In March 1979, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "In the current historical transition period, problems are piled up like mountains, and there are countless tasks to be accomplished. Strengthening the Party's leadership and rectifying the Party's style of work are of decisive significance." Soon after, Comrade Chen Yun sternly pointed out in 1980: "The issue of the Party's style of work is a matter of life and death for the Party. Therefore, the issue of the Party's style of work must be addressed and must be addressed permanently." It can be said that this instruction is shocking. Faced with economic crimes such as embezzlement and bribery that have emerged in the process of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping timely proposed the strategy of "two hands." He pointed out: "With the hand of cracking down on economic crimes, we can open up to the outside world and activate the economy in the correct direction." At the same time, Comrade Chen Yun clearly pointed out: reform and opening up, but discipline cannot be relaxed. At the 13th National Congress of the Party, the Party Central Committee, on the basis of summing up experience, concentrated on proposing that the Party must undergo the dual tests of ruling the country and reform and opening up, believing that "this is the most important issue that the Party must solve in the new era." After the 13th National Congress, the Party Central Committee issued a special notice, clearly proposing: "Reform and opening up, prosperity of the economy, must be unwavering; maintaining integrity and preventing corruption, must also be unwavering." These are enough to show that the Party and the government have always attached importance to the issue of fighting corruption. Some individuals with ulterior motives ignore these facts, placing the Party and the government in a position of not fighting corruption, and their purpose is obviously to incite the masses to turn against the Party, using the name of fighting corruption to engage in anti-Party and anti-socialist system activities.

Our Party not only attaches importance to the issue of fighting corruption but also takes various positive measures to fight against the phenomenon of corruption. Anyone who respects history and facts will remember the large-scale "Three Anti" and "Five Anti" campaigns and other series of anti-corruption campaigns launched and led by our Party in the 1950s and 1960s. In these campaigns, our Party expelled batch after batch of corrupt and degenerate elements from the Party, and those like Liu Qing Shan and Zhang Zi Shan, who were severely involved in corruption, were also subject to legal sanctions. Entering the era of reform and opening up, while actively rectifying the Party's style of work, the Party has also launched a large-scale campaign to crack down on economic crimes. According to statistics from relevant departments, from February 1982 to June 1986, more than 67,600 Party members were disciplined for economic issues, of whom 25,598 were expelled from the Party. According to the needs of the anti-corruption campaign, the Party Central Committee, the National People's Congress, and the State Council have also taken a series of measures in organizational setup and legislation, successively restoring and establishing disciplinary inspection, supervision, audit, and procuratorial organs, and promulgating several laws and regulations to strengthen Party discipline, government discipline, and the rule of law. Since 1987, the disciplinary inspection organs have handled more than 100,000 disciplinary cases of Party members each year. In 1988, the procuratorial organs accepted 21,100 cases of embezzlement and bribery, of which more than 3,700 Party and government officials were subject to legal sanctions. In the past year, the Party Central Committee has also implemented the "two opennesses and one supervision" and the public reporting system nationwide. Last year alone, the procuratorial organs accepted more than 147,000 reports. Of the more than 52,000 reports within the scope of the procuratorial organs' work, 241 involved bureau-level officials and 19 involved provincial and ministerial-level officials. Regarding the punishment of speculation and profiteering, especially official speculation, those who respect facts will also admit that since 1982, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have never stopped, shutting down numerous "briefcase companies," and conducting several rounds of concentrated rectification and cleanup of Party and government agencies and Party and government officials engaging in business and entrepreneurship. Especially in the second half of last year, the State Council made necessary adjustments in policies and regulations, stopping the trend of government agencies engaging in business. On the basis of cleaning up and rectifying companies, this year it was also required to start from investigating the flow of scarce commodities and important production materials to resolutely investigate and deal with the problems of speculation and profiteering that occurred in the past. It must be admitted that this work is very complex, with great resistance, and it is not possible to achieve results in a short period of time.

It is undeniable that in this new historical turning point, some Party members, especially some leading Party members, have not withstood the test and have taken the road of corruption and power-for-money exchange, tarnishing the image of the Party and the government. But it must be seen that the corrupt elements within the Party are after all in the minority, and the majority of Party members are honest and upright, and many comrades have written countless songs of resisting corruption and upholding integrity with their selfless and fearless actions. Their actions have ensured that the Party has withstood the two tests as a whole. In this regard, the behavior of Party members and cadres in the disciplinary inspection, supervision, and procuratorial lines may be more representative. In order to punish corrupt elements and maintain the dignity of Party and state laws, they do not calculate personal gains and losses, do not shy away from hard work, are not afraid of being attacked and framed, and strictly enforce discipline and law. In a few years, they have made tens of thousands of lawbreakers and disorderly elements receive the appropriate Party discipline, government discipline, and legal sanctions. In the process, their work has received the active support of Party and government leaders and the broad masses. Whenever they encounter great resistance, the leaders always help to remove it in a timely manner. In contrast, those who are keen on promoting bourgeois liberalization attack and curse the anti-corruption work. They say that punishing corrupt elements is "suppressing 'reformers,'" and strictly enforcing discipline is "restricting the hands and feet of 'pioneers'..." From these two aspects, people can clearly see that the majority of Party members and cadres are not only not corrupt but also actively and resolutely in the rectification of corruption. Those who promote bourgeois liberalization and conspire to create turmoil are not the leading force in fighting corruption but are protecting corrupt elements. From the performance of people like Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian in selling out the country for personal gain, they themselves are thorough corrupt elements. Regarding their evil purpose of attempting to "overthrow the government" and "kill 47 million Communist Party members" under the pretext of fighting corruption, the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the people of the whole country will never agree.

Modern history proves that in China, apart from the Communist Party, no other party or organization can lead the fight against corruption and achieve the goal of eliminating corruption. As the representative of the class, the Communist Party of China is the most advanced and most combat-effective vanguard of the proletariat; as a party, we are dedicated to serving the people, most willing to accept the supervision of the masses, with the strictest discipline, and most daring to expose and seriously clean up the problems of Party members' lack of integrity. It is for this reason that our Party has won the trust of the people of the whole country. After long-term arduous and bloody struggles, it overthrew the corrupt autocratic rule, eliminated the corrupt system of exploitation, and established a republic where the people are the masters. Therefore, the current phenomenon of corruption is not inherent in the proletarian party and the socialist system, but is a problem in the process of advancing towards modernization, a problem in development, and a problem that can be overcome and eliminated.

So, why is the effectiveness of the fight against corruption not as expected? I think there are two main reasons: on the one hand, eliminating the phenomenon of corruption is a very complex and long-term struggle that runs through the entire process of reform and opening up and even the primary stage of socialism. From the causes of the emergence of corruption, there are both subjective aspects of the behavior of individuals and complex economic, political, and social aspects. These problems are not formed in a short period of time and cannot be completely solved in a short period of time. They must be done with a large amount of painstaking and meticulous work and require long-term efforts. It is not effective to just complain and shout slogans. Because handling illegal and disorderly issues must have sufficient evidence and cannot be handled based on hearsay or certain phenomena about a unit or individual. Otherwise, it often leads to the wrongful convictions that people do not want to see. At the same time, reform and opening up, the development of the commodity economy have brought about many new situations and problems. Although the Party Central Committee has actively taken some measures, it must be admitted that we still lack experience in preventing some corrupt phenomena. The measures to solve problems from being ineffective to being effective need a process of exploration and practice. On the other hand, it must be admitted that some mistakes in the work of the Party and the government, especially the serious neglect of Party building, spiritual civilization construction, and ideological and political work during the period when Comrade Zhao Ziyang presided over the central work, directly affected the effectiveness of the fight against corruption. The key to the dissatisfaction of the masses may be here. However, it must be seen that our Party is able to quickly correct its own mistakes. The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee not only adjusted the central leading cadre group but also deployed the strengthening of ideological and political work and Party building, and the punishment of corruption as important work at present. The broad masses can completely believe that the new central leading cadre group, while clearly opposing the turmoil and rebellion, will continue to clearly oppose corruption, take more effective measures, improve the effectiveness of the fight against corruption, and will not disappoint the people's expectations.

    我们党是反腐败的主导力量
    武洪威
    在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱中，反腐败是一个很响亮的口号。绝大多数学生和群众对腐败现象义愤填膺，极少数别有用心的人则利用反腐败的旗号进行反党反社会主义的阴谋活动，他们的调子唱得比谁都高，好像只有依了他们，中国才能清除腐败现象。这就提出了一个问题，究竟谁是反腐败的主导力量？
    大量事实证明，反腐败的主导力量只能是为绝大多数人民谋利益的中国共产党，而不是极少数搞资产阶级自由化、制造动乱的人。
    人们都会记得，早在党即将夺取全国政权的时候，毛泽东同志就在党的七届二中全会上提出：“务必使同志们继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风，务必使同志们继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”执政以后，党长期坚持了对全党的反对腐败、艰苦奋斗的教育，使绝大多数党员抵制了资产阶级糖衣炮弹的侵袭，许多老同志至今保持着战争年代的传统作风，成为反腐倡廉的楷模。在改革开放的新形势下，党中央许多领导同志敏锐地意识到改革开放中出现的腐败现象，指出党将面临新的严峻考验，做了一系列重要指示。1979年3月，邓小平同志就指出：“在目前的历史转变时期，问题堆积如山，工作百端待举，加强党的领导，端正党的作风具有决定意义。”紧接着，陈云同志于1980年严肃指出：“执政党的党风问题是有关党的生死存亡的问题。因此，党风问题必须抓紧搞、永远搞。”应当说，这一指示是震聋发聩的。面对改革开放中出现的贪污、受贿等经济犯罪行为，邓小平同志及时提出了“两手抓”的对策。他指出：“有了打击经济犯罪这一手，对外开放、对内搞活经济就可以沿着正确的方向走。”与此同时，陈云同志明确指出：改革开放，纪律不能松绑。在党的十三大上，党中央在总结经验的基础上，集中地提出了党要经受执政和改革开放的双重经验，认为
  “这是新时期党的建设必然解决的最重大的课题。”十三大之后党中央专门发出通知，明确提出：“改革开放，繁荣经济，要坚定不移；保持廉洁，防止腐败，也要坚定不移”。这些足以说明，党和政府历来是重视反腐败问题的。一些别有用心的人无视这些事实，置党和政府于不反腐败的地位，其目的显然是在挑拨人民群众与党的关系，以反腐败之名行反党反社会主义制度之实。
    我们党不仅重视反腐败问题，而且采取各种积极措施同腐败现象进行了斗争。任何一个尊重历史、尊重事实的人，都会记得五、六十年代我们党发动和领导的大规模的“三反”、“五反”等一系列反腐败斗争。在这些斗争中，我们党将一批又一批腐化堕落分子清除出党，像刘青山、张子善那样的严重贪赃枉法者还受到了法律制裁。进入改革开放年代，党在积极端正党风的同时，及时开展了大规模的打击经济犯罪斗争。据有关部门统计，1982年2月至1986年6月，全国有67600多名党员因为经济问题受到党纪处分，其中25598人被开除出党。根据反腐败斗争的需要，党中央、全国人大、国务院还在机构设置、立法等方面采取了一系列措施，先后恢复、建立了纪检、监察、审计、检察机关，颁布了若干法律、法规，加强了党纪、政纪、法制建设。1987年以来，纪检机关每年查处违纪党员都在10万人以上。1988年，检察机关受理贪污、受贿案件达21100多件，其中受到法律制裁的党员干部有3700多人。去年以来，党中央还在全国范围内推行了“两公开、一监督”和群众举报制度，仅检察机关去年就受理各种举报147000多件。在属于检察院工作范围的52000多件举报中，涉及司局级干部241人，省部级干部19人。对于惩治投机倒把特别是官倒，尊重事实的人也会承认，1982年以来党中央、国务院一直没有间断，取缔了众多的“皮包公司”，先后几次对党政机关和党政干部经商办企业问题进行集中清理整顿。特别是去年下半年，国务院在政策、法规上进行了必要调整，刹住了机关经商歪风。在清理整顿公司的基础上，今年又要求从清查紧俏商品、重要生产资料流向入手，坚决查处过去发生的投机谋利、中饱私囊的问题。必须承认，这项工作十分复杂，阻力很大，不可能在很短时间就能奏效。
    无庸讳言，在新的历史转折时期，确有一些党员特别是一些党员领导干部没能经受住考验，走上了以权谋私、权钱交易的腐败道路，败坏了党和政府的形象。但必须看到，党内的腐败分子终究是少数，多数党员是清正廉洁的，其中很多同志以自己无私无畏的行动谱写了无数的抵制腐蚀、弘扬正气的廉洁之歌。他们的行动，保证了党在整体上经受住了两个考验。在这方面，纪检、监察、检察战线的党员干部的行为也许更有代表性。为了惩处腐败分子，维护党纪国法的尊严，他们不计名利，不辞劳苦，不怕打击陷害，严肃执纪执法，几年时间内就使几十万名违法乱纪者受到了应有的党纪、政纪、法律的惩处。这中间，他们的工作得到了党政领导和广大群众的积极支持。每当遇到大的阻力，总是领导及时帮助排除。与此相反，那些热衷于搞资产阶级自由化的人，对反腐败工作却极力进行攻击和谩骂。他们说惩处腐败分子是“打击‘改革者’”，严肃执行纪律是“束缚‘开拓者’手脚”……。从这两个侧面，人们可以清楚看出，大多数党员、干部不仅没有腐败，而且在整治腐败现象中表现是积极的，坚决的。那些搞资产阶级自由化、阴谋制造动乱者不是反腐败的主导力量，而是在保护腐败分子。从方励之、李淑娴等人卖国求荣的表现看，他们自己就是十足的腐败分子。对于他们以反腐败为借口，企图“推翻政府”、“杀死四千七百万共产党党徒”的罪恶目的，广大党员、干部和全国人民是绝不会答应的。
    近代历史证明，在中国，除了共产党，没有任何政党和组织能够领导反腐败斗争，并实现消除腐败现象的目标。作为阶级的代表，中国共产党是最先进、最有战斗力的无产阶级先锋队；作为政党，我们是以为人民服务为宗旨，最乐于接受群众监督，纪律最严明，最敢于揭露并认真清除党内不廉洁问题的政党。正因为如此，我们党才赢得了全国人民的信赖，经过长期艰苦卓绝的浴血奋斗，推翻了腐朽的专制独裁统治，铲除了腐败的剥削制度，建立了人民当家做主的共和国。所以，目前出现的腐败现象，不是无产阶级政党和社会主义制度所固有的，而是向现代化迈进中的问题，是发展中的问题，是可以克服和消除的。
    那么，为什么反腐败的成效不尽如人意呢？我认为，主要是两方面原因：一方面，消除腐败现象是十分复杂、贯穿改革开放乃至社会主义初级阶段全过程的长期斗争。从腐败现象产生的原因看，既有行为者个人主观意识方面的原因，也有复杂的经济、政治、社会方面的原因，这些问题都不是短期内形成的，也不可能在短期内彻底解决，必须做大量艰苦细致的工作，经过长期的努力。绝不是发牢骚、喊口号所能奏效的。因为处理违法乱纪问题必须有充分证据，绝不能只凭道听途说或某些现象就处理哪一个单位和个人。否则，往往会造成人们不愿意看到的冤假错案。同时，改革开放、发展商品经济出现了许多新情况、新问题，党中央虽然积极采取了一些措施，但必须承认我们在防止某些腐败现象上还缺乏经验。解决问题的措施由效果不明显到成效显著，需要有一个探索实践过程。另一方面，必须承认，党和政府工作上的某些失误，特别是赵紫阳同志主持中央工作期间严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，直接影响了反腐败斗争的成效。人民群众不满意的关键也许就在这里。但是，必须看到我们党是能够迅速改正自己的错误的。党的十三届四中全会不仅调整了中央领导班子，会议还把加强思想政治工作和党的建设、惩治腐败作为当前重要工作进行了部署。广大群众完全可以相信，新的中央领导班子在旗帜鲜明地反对动乱和暴乱的同时，将继续旗帜鲜明地反对腐败，采取更有力的措施，提高反腐败的成效，绝不会辜负
  人民的希望。
