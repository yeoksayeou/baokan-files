    Abandoned Air-Raid Shelters Need Proper Handling

    For a period, various units dug different types of air-raid shelters in their courtyards and residential areas. Now, some sturdy shelters have been converted into underground warehouses; others, after renovation and decoration, have been turned into underground markets or hotels. However, there are still many poorly constructed and unmanaged shelters. Some have no covers or doors, and the interiors are filled with sewage, posing potential hazards if left unattended.

    In the courtyard of the Jinhua Quilt Factory dormitory in our city, there is an air-raid shelter that is over 10 meters deep. After the shelter's cover was stolen, it remained uncovered for many days. A child playing near the opening accidentally fell in and died on the spot. In another incident in the Taojia Mountain residential area, a family had dug an air-raid shelter in their home. Due to the long-term accumulation of water in the shelter, the ground suddenly collapsed and the wall fell last year, leaving the family in deep regret.

    It is hoped that the relevant departments will take early action to properly handle the air-raid shelters.

    废防空洞需妥善处理
    在一个时期里，一些单位的大院和住宅区里，挖了各式各样的防空洞。如今，有些坚固的防空洞成了地下仓库；有的经过修整装饰后，改为地下商场或旅店；还有许多建筑粗糙无人管的防空洞，有的洞口无盖无门，洞内污水漫顶，长此下去，将成为事故隐患。
    我市锦华被单厂职工宿舍大院里，有一个防空洞洞深10多米，洞盖被人盗走后，多日无遮无栏。有一个小孩在洞口边玩耍时不慎掉入洞里，当即死亡。另在陶家山居民区，有一户居民当年曾在家里挖了一个防空洞。由于洞内长年积水未有处理，结果去年突然地陷墙倒，家人后悔莫及。希望有关部门尽早对防空洞妥善处理。
