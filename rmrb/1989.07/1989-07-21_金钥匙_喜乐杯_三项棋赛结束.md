The nationwide youth palace system "Jin Yaoshi Xile Cup" three-board game competition, after 5 days of intense competition with 343 games, concluded successfully on July 21st at the Beijing Youth Palace.

This competition saw the team championships in international chess, Go, and Chinese chess won by the second team of the Beijing Youth Palace, the Xi'an Youth Palace, and the first team of the Beijing Youth Palace, respectively. The moral excellence award went to the first team of the Beijing Youth Palace and the Jinzhou Youth Palace of Liaoning Province.

The individual champions in international chess were Zhu Jiaqi from Tianjin and Shi Binbin from Shenyang. The individual champions in Go were Jia Jizhou from Xi'an and Wong Yuen-ping from Beijing. The individual champions in Chinese chess were Feng Lei from Beijing and Shang Zhi-hua from Tianjin.

A notable feature of this competition was the close level of play and intense competition. The young players showed great tenacity, with the final rankings only determined in the last round. The number of participants in each event differed from previous years, with more participants in Go than in international chess, and more in international chess than in Chinese chess. This indicates that Go and international chess have been widely popularized nationwide. This competition has promoted the development of chess activities in youth palaces across the country.

Today, at the closing ceremony, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Fang Yi, Vice Chairman of the China Rosong Qingling Foundation Rong Gaotang, and chess grandmaster Nie Weiping presented awards to the winning units and individuals. Liu Yushun, a student from North Korea, spoke on behalf of foreign students from Mali and Congo studying in Beijing, expressing the hope for more opportunities to exchange chess skills with Chinese children and strengthen unity.
