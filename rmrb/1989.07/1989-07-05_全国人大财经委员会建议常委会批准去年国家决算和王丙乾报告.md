Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Financial and Economic Affairs Committee recommended that the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress approve the 1988 state budget and the report by Wang Binqian, the State Councilor and Minister of Finance, on behalf of the State Council, on the 1988 state budget.

Li Peng, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Financial and Economic Affairs Committee, said today in the report on the review of the 1988 state budget by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Financial and Economic Affairs Committee that the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee recommends that the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress approve the 1988 state budget and the report by Wang Binqian, the State Councilor and Minister of Finance, on behalf of the State Council, on the 1988 state budget.

Li Peng said that the Seventh National People's Congress, First Session, approved the 1988 state budget, which has been achieved through the efforts of all levels of government. In 1988, expenditures on key construction projects such as energy, transportation, agriculture, and education increased compared to the previous year, improving the expenditure structure. However, local governments allocated more funds for basic construction than budgeted (the excess has been deducted in the final budget), and administrative management expenses exceeded the budget significantly. At the same time, there was significant leakage in fiscal revenue and waste in expenditures, which need to be improved with effective measures in the future.

Li Peng said that the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee believes that due to consecutive years of fiscal deficits, the national finances are in considerable difficulty. The recent political turmoil in Beijing and some other places, which escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, has further exacerbated the financial difficulties. Currently, we must earnestly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, continue to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, continue with reform and opening up. We must continue to carry out rectification and adjustment, promote sustained, stable, and coordinated economic development. All regions and departments must strive to increase production and savings, increase revenue and control expenditures, and make up for the economic losses caused by the turmoil and riot.

Regarding the implementation of the 1989 state budget, Li Peng said that the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee proposed six opinions when reviewing the 1989 budget draft. Now, based on the problems reflected in the first five months of budget execution, the following recommendations are made: (1) Expedite the implementation of various revenue-increasing measures to make up for the shortfall as much as possible. (2) Strengthen tax collection and management, clear and recover overdue taxes and profits. Those who evade taxes or refuse to pay taxes should be dealt with according to law. (3) State-owned enterprises should strive to improve economic efficiency and contribute more to the state. Those with operating losses should strive to reduce or eliminate the losses. (4) Adhere to the spirit of hard work and frugality, and uphold the glorious tradition of thrift in all endeavors. All expenditures must be carefully calculated, and wasteful spending must be opposed. Leaders, especially high-level officials, must lead by example, be honest and upright, and practice thrift. For corruption in party and government organs, effective measures must be taken to resolutely investigate and punish those who violate the law. In summary, all regions and departments must work hard to achieve this year's state budget.

    全国人大财经委员会建议常委会批准去年国家决算和王丙乾报告
    新华社北京7月5日电　全国人大财经委员会副主任委员李朋今天在作全国人民代表大会财政经济委员会关于1988年国家决算的审查报告时说，财经委员会建议全国人民代表大会常务委员会第八次会议，批准1988年国家决算，批准国务委员兼财政部部长王丙乾代表国务院所作的关于1988年国家决算的报告。
    李朋说，第七届全国人民代表大会第一次会议批准的1988年国家预算，经过各级政府努力，已经实现。1988年，能源、交通、农业和教育等重点建设方面的支出比上年增加，使支出的结构有所改进。但是，地方用机动财力安排的基本建设支出超过了预算（超过的部分已在决算中扣除），行政管理费支出超过预算的幅度较大，同时财政收入中的流失和支出中的浪费严重，这些都需要今后采取有力的措施加以改进。
    李朋说，财政经济委员会认为，由于几年来连年有财政赤字，国家财政相当困难，最近两个月来，北京和一些地方发生政治动乱进而在北京发展为反革命暴乱，又加剧了财政困难。当前，要认真贯彻中共十三届四中全会的精神，继续坚持四项基本原则，继续坚持改革、开放。要继续搞好治理整顿，促进经济持续、稳定、协调地发展。各地区、各部门要努力增产节约、增收节支，抓紧收入，控制支出，挽回动乱和暴乱所造成的经济损失。
    关于实现1989年国家预算，李朋说，财经委员会在审查1989年预算草案时曾提出六点意见，现在根据1至5月预算执行中反映出来的问题，建议：（一）抓紧落实各项增收措施，使预计可能短收的部分尽量予以弥补。（二）要大力加强税收的征管工作，清理收回被占压、拖欠的税款和利润。对偷税漏税的，抗税不交的，应依法处理。（三）国营企业要努力提高经济效益，向国家多做贡献。有经营性亏损的，要努力减少以至消除亏损。（四）要坚持艰苦创业的精神和发扬勤俭办一切事业的光荣传统。一切开支都要精打细算，反对铺张浪费。领导干部，特别是高级干部，要以身作则，廉洁奉公，厉行节约。对于党政机关中的腐败现象，要采取有力的措施，坚决予以查处，触犯刑律的要依法惩办。总之，各地区、各部门要抓紧工作，为实现今年的国家预算而奋斗。
