Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 4th.

"Voice of America" broadcasted another distorted report on July 3rd, which has aroused strong dissatisfaction and indignation among people here.

"Voice of America" on July 3rd quoted an official from the U.S. Embassy in China as saying that "evidence has been gathered proving that the Chinese military intentionally fired at the 'Diplomatic Apartments' where foreigners reside in Beijing last month," claiming that it was a "carefully planned" action, rather than an "impulsive action by the military" as China has stated.

Relevant officials here say, "Voice of America" is spreading rumors. The truth is, around 10 a.m. on June 7th, when a martial law unit was moving westwards through the Jianguo Gate overpass, they were fired upon from both the Jianguo Gate Diplomatic Apartments and the south side of the road. One soldier was killed and three were injured. The unit was forced to retaliate and briefly surrounded the Diplomatic Apartments and other buildings before quickly withdrawing. News agencies in China reported this on the same day.

Relevant officials here pointed out that it is clear that someone from the Diplomatic Apartments and the buildings across the street simultaneously fired at the advancing Chinese troops, which shows that they were deliberately and carefully planned. This raises a sharp question: why would someone from the Diplomatic Apartments fire at the Chinese military carrying out martial law duties? It is not difficult to judge that these people are either residents of the Diplomatic Apartments or criminals hiding there. Clearly, it was they who shot and injured the PLA soldiers, but "Voice of America" avoids mentioning this and especially avoids discussing the fact that someone from the Diplomatic Apartments fired at the Chinese military. Isn't this just evidence of their guilt? "Voice of America" also claims that this incident was "carefully planned" by the Chinese military and that "evidence has been gathered." Why don't you present this "evidence"? The martial law unit was unexpectedly ambushed and suffered casualties, so they have the right to retaliate in self-defense. The Chinese side has never said that this was a "military impulsive action."

Relevant officials here say, we must warn "Voice of America," China is no longer a vassal of anyone. China is a sovereign state and does not accept your hegemonic politics. In the past few months, your interference in China's internal affairs has gone too far and it is time for you to rein it in.

### “美国之音”又在颠倒黑白

    “美国之音”又在颠倒黑白
    新华社北京7月4日电　“美国之音”3日广播了又一则颠倒黑白的报道，引起此间人士强烈的不满和愤慨。
    “美国之音”3日援引美国驻华大使馆官员的话说什么“已经搜集到证据证明中国军队上个月向北京外国人居住的‘外交公寓’开枪是蓄意的”，“精心策划的，而不是像中国所说的是军队的一种冲动行动”。
    此间有关人士说，“美国之音”又在造谣。事实的真相是，6月7日上午10时左右，当我一支戒严部队自东向西开进，经建国门立交桥附近时，遭到来自建国门外交公寓和路南两个方向的枪击，部队官兵当场死亡一人伤三人。该支部队被迫回击，并一度包围了外交公寓等建筑物，随即迅速撤离。关于这方面的情况，中国新闻机构当天即已作了报道。
    此间有关人士指出，明明是有人从这所外交公寓和马路对面的建筑物内同时向行进中的中国部队打冷枪，配合得那么默契，正好说明是他们蓄意精心策划的。这里存在一个尖锐的问题，为什么竟然有人从外交公寓向执行戒严任务的中国军队射击？不难判断，这种人要么是住在外交公寓里的人，要么是被窝藏在外交公寓的歹徒。明明是他们开枪打死打伤了解放军战士，“美国之音”却避而不谈，而且特别讳言外交公寓里有人向中国军队开枪的事实，这不是正好说明它的心虚吗？“美国之音”还说什么这个事件是中国军队“精心策划”的，还说“搜集到了证据”，为什么你们不把这种“证据”拿出来！？戒严部队遭到意外狙击并有伤亡，当然有权向开冷枪方向进行自卫还击，中国方面从来没有人说过这是什么“军人的一种冲动行为”。
    此间有关人士说，我们要正告“美国之音”，中国早已不是谁的什么附庸，中国是主权国家，不吃你们那一套强权政治，近几个月来，你们干涉中国内政做得太过分了，也该有所收敛了。
