    The Policy of Establishing Economic Special Zones Will Not Change; Shenzhen Will Accelerate Reform and Opening-Up
    Xinhua News Agency, Shenzhen, July 8th - (Reporter Jiang Shunchang) Shenzhen Mayor Li Huo announced on the 7th that the central government attaches great importance to the status and role of the Shenzhen Special Zone, requiring the Shenzhen Special Zone to fully utilize foreign capital, introduce technology, accelerate development, and better play the role of reform and opening-up. To convey and implement the spirit of the 4th Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the Shenzhen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a three-day expanded meeting of the Standing Committee, and Li Huo made a summary speech at the end of this meeting.

    Li Huo said, will the policy of the Party and the state regarding the establishment of economic special zones change? Some people have some concerns. Here, I can clearly tell everyone that the policy of reform and opening-up in the special zone will not change. If there is any change, it will only be more open and more in line with international practices; democracy and the rule of law will be more complete, and foreign investment will be more secure.

    Mayor Li said, according to the recent requirements of the central government for the Shenzhen Special Zone, we need to further open up the special zone, formulate key policies and development strategies as major research topics. From this, it can be seen that the prospects for the Shenzhen Special Zone are bright.

    Li Huo expressed that in the second half of the year, Shenzhen will continue to deepen reforms. First, we must focus on improving the enterprise contract responsibility system. Second, we will promote democratic political construction, improve the special zone's democratic consultation and supervision mechanism, and expedite the establishment of democratic consultation and supervision institutions. Before the Municipal People's Congress is established, we must open up more channels for democratic consultation and supervision to satisfy the desire of people from all walks of life to participate in politics and create the necessary conditions for the people to fully exercise their democratic supervision rights. In the future, the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government will widely solicit opinions from all sides when promoting major reform projects, formulating new policies, regulations, and systems, and implementing construction and development plans that have an impact on the special zone. Third, we will expedite the preparatory work for the establishment of the Municipal People's Congress. The Municipal Committee, after repeated research, has submitted a plan to the province, and once approved, the work of establishing the Municipal People's Congress will be fully launched.

    办经济特区的政策不会变  深圳将加快改革开放步伐
    新华社深圳7月8日电　（记者蒋顺章）深圳市市长李灏7日宣布，中央十分重视深圳特区的地位和作用，要求深圳特区放手利用外资，引进技术，加快发展，更好地发挥改革、开放的作用。为传达贯彻党的13届4中全会精神，中共深圳市委召开了为期三天的常委扩大会议，李灏在这次会议结束时作了总结发言。
    李灏说，党和国家关于办经济特区的政策会不会变呢？有些人有一些担心。在这里，我可以明确地告诉大家，特区的改革开放政策不会变。如果有变，只会变得更加开放，更加符合国际惯例；民主与法制更加健全，外商投资更有保障。
    李市长说，根据最近中央对深圳特区的要求，我们要把特区进一步开放，制定重点政策和发展战略，作为重大研究课题。由此可见，深圳特区的前景是光明的。
    李灏表示，在下半年深圳要继续深化改革。第一要突出抓好完善企业承包经营责任制。第二推进民主政治建设，完善特区的民主咨询监督机制，抓紧建立民主咨询监督的机构，在市人大未建立之前，要多开辟一些民主、咨询、监督的渠道，尽可能地满足各阶层人士参政议政的愿望，为人民群众充分行使民主监督权利创造必要的条件。今后，市委和市政府在推行重大的改革项目，制定新的政策、规定、制度，实施特区有影响的建设发展规划之前，都将广泛听取各方面的意见，接受群众监督。第三要抓紧成立市人大的各项筹备工作。市委经过反复研究，已向省里提出了方案，一经批准，成立市人大的各项工作就要全面展开。
