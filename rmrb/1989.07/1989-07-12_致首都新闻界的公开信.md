Title: An Open Letter to the Capital's Journalists

Edition: 4

The editors of the Beijing Daily note: Gao Sheng's letter was written on May 23. We are now publishing it, believing it will help some of our comrades reflect. To some of our colleagues and friends in the news industry:

On the afternoon of May 22, intellectuals, journalists, and cultural figures in the capital took to the streets in what was called a "grand procession." I do not know if this procession was organized by the leaders of the cultural sector or if it was spontaneous. I also do not know if these marchers represented the wishes of the entire cultural sector, including journalists, or only the wishes of those who participated. Here, I only want to express my differing views with you, the journalists and other cultural figures who participated in yesterday's procession.

Please allow me to quote some of the slogans from your "grand procession":

"Troops are approaching, the capital is in danger! The country is in danger! The people are in danger! Once the troops enter the city, the 10 million people of the capital will live under the bayonets!"

"Against order under the bayonet!"

"Chinese people will no longer be slaves!"

...and so on.

Gentlemen, don't you find these slogans alarmist?

Undoubtedly, in your view, the entry of the People's Liberation Army into the city is not to maintain social order or to protect the broad masses of the people, including students, and public property. Instead, it is to suppress the people. I ask these gentlemen, what is the basis for your judgment (or conclusion)?

For more than a month, the students' petition activities have indeed won some sympathy from the masses. I myself am also sympathetic. However, I do not support the students' use of hunger strikes as a means of petitioning, nor do I support hunger strikes in Tiananmen Square. Because this method essentially treats the People's Government under the leadership of the Communist Party as an opposing force or as an "opponent." Moreover, hunger strikes in Tiananmen Square disrupted some important activities during Gorbachev's visit to China, to some extent damaging the country's image. This is something that has never happened in Beijing in the 40 years since liberation. The Party and state leaders have repeatedly said that the students' desire for democracy and opposition to corruption is in line with the central government's wishes, hoping to solve these problems through democratic and legal channels, and guaranteeing a willingness to engage in multi-level dialogues with the students, even begging the students to stop their hunger strikes and withdraw from the square. However, the students, having the opportunity to step down, refused to eat and refused to withdraw from the square. Can this be called rational?

Since the students began their hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, I have been to the square every day, witnessing and hearing some people of unknown identity, under the banner of supporting the student movement, either inciting madness in the crowd or maliciously slandering and cursing the Party and the government, or creating and spreading rumors. For example, on the afternoon of the 17th, a man in his 50s claiming to be a worker from Qingdao climbed onto the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes on the south side, inciting people to smash the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, "overthrow the tyrannical rule." He was stopped by the students present and driven away. On the 16th at noon, a man in his 40s on the west side of the monument told the students that the Communist Party is the most reactionary, inciting the students to form a new political party. That evening at around 10 o'clock, a middle-aged woman in the crowd said without any basis that the central leaders have tens of billions of personal savings abroad. She also said that a certain unit "sold cars for a year and spent 13 billion yuan." (Anyone with a little common sense knows how many billions our country's national production value is in a year.) On the evening of the 17th, outside the east gate of the Great Hall of the People, a few people incited the crowd gathered there to storm the Great Hall. A woman in her 20s shouted, "Come on, guys, charge!" On the night of the 17th (or 18th), under a flag marked "Broadcasting Academy" on the north side of the square, a group of people sat around, supposedly holding a free forum. People gave speeches one after another. Among the speakers, some talked about how bad the Communist Party is, some advocated for a multi-party system. A man claiming to be a worker incited, "The Communist Party has been in power for 40 years, a dark 40 years, isn't it?"

The above situations show that before the government issued the martial law, some people were already engaged in premeditated activities.

After the government issued the martial law, some people, under the banner of protecting students and the capital, engaged in even more brazen incitement, continuing to create and spread rumors such as "the PLA entering the city is to suppress students and the people," "there will be a massacre soon," and so on. Some even maliciously attacked the Communist Party, the socialist system, and the people's government. For example, around 10 PM on the 21st, a man claiming to be a reporter from a certain women's newspaper (I called the women's newspaper the next evening to inquire, and was told there was no such reporter) in the crowd said, "Every country ruled by the Communist Party is a failure, only when the Communist Party steps down will the people have democracy and freedom." At 11 PM, on a bus used as a barricade at Chongwenmen, a woman spread the rumor that the PLA, once entering the city, would massacre unarmed civilians, inciting people to "resist the tyranny."

Now, let's take a look at some of the members of the so-called "citizen death squads" and motorcycle teams that have been roaming Tiananmen Square and Chang'an Avenue every day. On the evening of the 21st, when a "death squad" stopped a truck on the road at Liujia Bridge, a squad member shouted, "We can't let the army enter the city, otherwise we will all go to prison!" Another squad member shouted, "I've been in prison twice already." On the same night, when the motorcycle team was slowly moving through Tiananmen Square, a bystander cheered them on, and a motorcyclist said, "I've been in prison for eight years, I'm not afraid, it's all or nothing, either they die or we live." On the same night, a group of people with the banner of the "death squad" marched around the square, shouting the slogan "Invincible, fight to the end." A squad member cursed, "Fuck her mother! I've had deep grudges against them for a long time."

The above are just a few of the situations I have witnessed and heard that are contrary to the students' wishes. But these situations are enough to show that there are indeed people who want to take advantage of the students' patriotic enthusiasm to achieve goals that are usually unattainable. This goal is to create disturbances, create chaos, and overthrow the Communist Party and the people's government it leads. In such a serious situation, the Party and the government have taken decisive measures and issued martial law, which is completely necessary. Any country facing such turmoil in Beijing would take measures such as martial law or curfew. Other countries can implement martial law, but our country cannot? Implementing it means "bloody rule"? Means "order under the bayonet"? Gentlemen, your slogans from yesterday's procession are strikingly similar to the statements made by those conspirators in society.

In theory, colleagues in the news industry should keep in step with the Party and the government, and clearly oppose and stop the chaos that has occurred. However, you participated in the so-called "grand procession of Chinese intellectuals," shouting alarmist slogans. Isn't this pouring oil on the fire?

I, an ordinary citizen, can still distinguish right from wrong, but the thoughts of the journalists who are called "cultural figures" are so confused, which is truly heartbreaking.

By the way, my desire for press freedom is no less than yours. But I believe that press freedom is not arbitrary freedom. Press freedom must, under the premise of being conducive to maintaining the socialist system and maintaining stability and unity, objectively, truly, and freely report. I think the journalists and friends in the news industry understand this more than I do, so do I need to repeat this here?

Journalists who participated in the "grand procession," since you demand "press freedom, lift media bans," and demand objective, fair, and true reporting, then the situations I mentioned earlier of some people inciting and spreading rumors, I believe you have also heard and seen, why are they not seen or rarely seen in your newspapers? Many people support the government's issuance of martial law. Some people temporarily do not support it because they believe the rumors, but once the rumors are dispelled, they will support it. However, the fact that this part of the people supports the PLA entering the city, except for a few newspapers in the capital, most newspapers do not report it. I ask, gentlemen, is this the "freedom" you pursue that is objective, fair, and true?

Finally, I sincerely hope that the journalists and friends in the news industry will not do things that cause pain to friends and joy to enemies. Keep in step with the Central Committee of the Party, this is the expectation of the people for the news industry and other intellectuals.

### 致首都新闻界的公开信

    致首都新闻界的公开信
    《北京日报》编者按　高声同志的这封来信写于5月23日，现在我们将它公开发表，相信会有助于我们一些同志的反思。部分新闻界的先生们、朋友们：
    5月22日下午，首都知识界、新闻界、文化界人士上街游行，据称是“大游行”。我不知道这次游行是各文化界领导组织的呢，还是自发组织的？也不知道这些游行的人是代表全部文化界包括新闻界人士意愿，还是只代表参加游行人的意愿？这里，我只想发表一下与你们新闻界还有其它各界参加昨日游行的文化人不同的看法。
    请先允许我把你们“大游行”呼的口号摘录若干：
    “大军压境，首都危急！祖国危急！人民危急！一旦大军进城，首都一千万人民将生活在刺刀之下！”
    “反对刺刀下的秩序！”
    “中国人不再做奴隶！”
    “……”
    先生们，这些口号你们不觉得耸人听闻吗？
    无疑，在你们看来，解放军进城不是来维护社会秩序，不是来保护包括学生在内的广大人民群众和公共财产的，而是来镇压人民的。我请问这些先生们，你们的判断（或曰结论）是根据什么得出来的呢？
    一个多月来，学生们的请愿活动确实赢得了一些群众的同情。我本人也是很同情的。但是，我不赞成学生采取绝食请愿的办法，更不赞成在天安门广场绝食请愿。因为这种办法实质上是把中国共产党领导下的人民政府当作对立面或曰当作“对手”来看待的，更不要说在天安门广场绝食干扰了戈氏访华的一些重要活动，在一定程度上确实损害了国家的形象。这是解放40年来北京不曾有过的事情。党和国家领导人一再地说学生要求民主、反对腐败的愿望是和中央的意愿是一致的，希望通过民主与法制的渠道去解决这些问题，并保证愿意与学生进行多层次的对话，甚至是请求学生们停止绝食、撤出广场。然而，学生们却有台阶而不下，拒绝进食、拒绝撤出广场，这能说明是理智的吗？
    自学生在天安门广场绝食以来，我每天都要到广场来，亲眼看到也亲耳听到一些身份不明的人打着支持学生运动的旗号，在人群中或是疯狂地煽动，或是对党和政府肆意地诋毁和谩骂，或是制造和传播谣言。如17日下午，一50余岁自称是青岛工人的人爬上人民英雄纪念碑南面的基座上煽动人们去砸毛主席纪念堂，“推翻暴君统治”。后被在场的学生制止并被哄了下来。16日中午一40多岁的男子在纪念碑西侧向学生胡说共产党是最反动的，煽动学生要组建新政党。是日晚10时左右一中年妇女在广场人群中毫无根据地说中央领导人在国外都有几十亿的私人存款。又说某单位“倒卖汽车一年就花了1300亿”。（稍有常识的人都会清楚我国一年国民生产值才有多少亿。）17日晚大会堂东门外少数人煽动聚集在这里的人们冲击大会堂，一20余岁的妇女大声疾呼“小伙子们，冲啊！”17日（或18日）夜间在广场北侧一杆标有广播学院的旗帜下围坐着一群人，据说这里是自由讲坛。一些人纷纷发表演讲。在演讲人中有的说共产党如何如何不好，有的鼓吹多党制。一个自称是工人的人煽动说“共产党在位40年是黑暗的40年，你们说是不是？”
    以上这些情况说明，在政府发布戒严令之前就有人在进行预谋的活动了。
    政府发布戒严令之后，一些人打着保卫学生、保卫首都的旗号进行更加猖狂地煽动，继续制造和传播谣言，什么“解放军进城是来镇压学生和人民的”、“就要大流血了”等等谣言四起。更有一些人恶毒攻击共产党，攻击社会主义制度和人民政府。如21日晚10时左右在天安门东面一自称是某妇女报的男性记者（次日晚我给某妇女报打电话质询，回电称无此记者）在人群中胡说“凡是共产党统治的国家都搞不好，只有共产党下台人民才有民主和自由。”晚23时，在崇文门用做路障的公共汽车上，一位女性散布说，解放军一旦进城就会屠杀手无寸铁的市民，煽动人们起来“抗暴”。
    再让我们看看那些整日穿行在天安门广场和长安大街上的所谓“市民敢死队”和摩托车队其中的一些成员是些什么人吧。21日晚当一“敢死队”乘一辆卡车停在六部口路上时，一敢死队员大声叫道：“不能让军队进城，否则我们都得进监狱！”另一队员喊道：“我他妈的进过两回了。”也是这天晚上，当摩托车队在天安门广场缓缓行进时，一围观者给他们打气，一摩托车手说：“八年大狱都过来了，老子怕什么，反正是豁出去啦，不是他们死就是我们活。”还是这天晚上，一伙人打着敢死队的旗子在广场四周游行，狂呼“刀枪不入，血战到底”的口号。一队员骂道“我×她妈！我对他们早就有深仇大恨了。”
    以上所举不过是笔者耳闻目睹的与学生愿望相反情况的一小部分。但笔者随手拈来的这些情况足以说明确实有人借学生的爱国热情想达到通常情况下达不到的目的。这目的就是要制造事端、制造混乱，推翻共产党和她领导下的人民政府。在这样一种严峻形势下，党和政府果断地采取措施，发布戒严令是完全必要的。任何一个国家出现如北京动乱都会采取戒严或宵禁一类措施的。别的国家可以实行戒严，我们国家就不能实施吗？！实施了就是“血腥统治”？就是“刺刀下的秩序”？先生们，你们昨天游行所呼的口号与社会上那些阴谋分子所散布的言论是何其的相似。
    按理说，新闻界的同志们应当与党和政府的步调保持一致，旗帜鲜明地反对和制止已经发生的动乱，然而你们却参加所谓“中国知识界大游行”，喊出耸人听闻的口号，这不是在火上浇油吗！
    我，一个普通老百姓，尚且能够分辨是非，而冠以“文化人”的新闻界的先生们思想却是如此混乱，这不能不让人痛心疾首。
    顺便说一点，敝人要求新闻自由的愿望不亚于你们。但敝人以为，新闻自由，绝不是任意的自由。新闻自由，必须在有利于维护社会主义制度、有利于维护安定团结这个大前提下去客观、如实、自由地报道的。我想这个道理新闻界的先生们、朋友们比我懂得多，还需我在这里老生常谈吗？
    参加“大游行”的记者先生们，既然你们要求“新闻自由、开放报禁”，要求客观公正如实地采访和报道，那么我前面提到的一些人进行煽动和造谣的情况，想必先生们也已耳闻目睹，为什么不见或少见诸你们的报端呢？对于政府发布戒严令很多群众是拥护的。还有一些群众一时相信谣传暂时不拥护，谣言一破他们也会拥护的。但是这部分群众拥护解放军进城的事实在首都除两三家报纸予以报道外，大部报纸却不见报道。请问先生们，这就是你们所追求的客观公正如实的“自由”吗？
    最后，我真诚地希望，新闻界的先生们、朋友们，不要再做亲者痛、仇者快的事情了。与党中央的步调保持一致，这就是人民群众对新闻界还有其它知识界的期望。
                                一个普通群众　高声
