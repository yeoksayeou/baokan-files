To enhance the combat effectiveness and cohesion of grassroots party organizations in rural areas, our county has adopted three methods—dispatching, selecting, and electing—to ensure that each village party branch secretary is well-suited for the role.

For villages where the overall quality of party members is low, and despite frequent changes in the branch secretary, the situation remains unchanged, leading to a loss of confidence among party members in transforming the backward face, we adopt the method of dispatching full-time cadres back to the village to take up posts. In the dispatch process, the county party committee insists on the principle of "mutual selection and satisfaction on four fronts." This means: the full-time cadre has the desire to change the backward face of the village, the majority of party members in the village have trust in the cadre returning to the village to take up the post, after being assessed by the county party committee's organization department, it is confirmed that the dispatched cadre has a high sense of party principles and certain work capabilities, and then obtains the agreement of the township party committee, signs a target responsibility book. After the dispatched cadre enters the village, they undergo a period of examination by the masses, and are elected by the branch party congress to become the branch secretary, achieving satisfaction from the county, township, village, and the full-time cadre themselves. To encourage party and government cadres to return to the village to take up posts, the county party committee has formulated corresponding policies.

For villages with relatively stable leadership but lacking in pioneering and enterprising spirit, and slow development of productive forces, we select party members with strong party principles, strong commodity economy awareness, certain production channels and technology, and the idea of leading the masses to get rich together, and who have a good mass foundation to serve as branch secretaries.

For villages where there is a struggle for power and profit, those on the stage do not do things properly, those off the stage sabotage, and cadres are frequently replaced, leading to a situation of rotating leadership, we adopt the method of election to produce branch secretaries. Candidates first publicly register, make policy speeches, and then the branch party congress votes to decide.

Over the past two years, the entire county has used these three methods to adjust 20 branch leadership teams, with significant results:

First, it has broadened the channels for selecting personnel, updated the standards for selecting personnel, and reformed and improved the mechanism for selecting and using rural cadres. The method of "three selections in parallel" has broken away from the past practice of "drawing lines and taking materials locally" for rural cadres, adopting multi-form and multi-position methods to select branch secretaries suitable for the village situation. Over the past two years, the entire county has had 10 leadership teams with county full-time cadres returning to the village to serve as branch secretaries, 9 villages have selected "team leaders" from wealthy individuals, and one village has democratically elected a branch "leader," effectively promoting the overall improvement of backward branches.

Second, it has enhanced the combat effectiveness, cohesion, and appeal of the branch leadership teams, making the work of the entire village lively. Last year, a cadre from the county propaganda department returned to Mujiazhuang Village to serve as the branch secretary. With the cooperation and support of cadres and the masses, he started from the most pressing problems that the masses care about, tackling the most difficult issues recognized by all. In less than half a year, he solved long-standing problems in procurement, levies, family planning, and village land, transforming this notorious "third-class village" into an advanced village.

Third, it has explored a new path to integrate organizational construction with economic construction. Last year, the newly elected party branch secretary of Zhirhe Store Village in Guozhuang Town was originally a wealthy individual. After taking office, he not only focused on implementing various party policies but also led the masses to get rich together, helping more than 50 households out of poverty in just one year.

    怎样配个好书记？
    我县为增强农村基层党组织的战斗力、凝聚力，区别情况，采用选派、选拔、竞选3种方式，尽量配好各村党支部书记。
    对党员整体素质差，党支部书记虽多次更换，但面貌依旧，党员对改变后进面貌失去信心的村，采取选派脱产干部回村任职的办法。在选派中，县委坚持“双向选择、四方满意”的原则。即：脱产干部有改变本村落后面貌的愿望，村里多数党员对回村任职的干部有信任感，经县委组织部考核，确认被选派的干部有较高的党性原则和一定的工作能力，而后征得所在乡镇党委同意，签订目标责任书。被选派的干部进村后，经过群众考察，党支部大会选举，担任支部书记，达到县、乡、村和脱产干部本人满意。为了鼓励党政机关干部回村任职，县委制定了相应的政策。
    对班子比较稳定，但缺乏开拓进取精神，生产力发展缓慢的村，选拔党性原则强，商品经济意识强，有一定的生产门路和技术，有带领群众共同致富的思想，有较好群众基础的党员担任支部书记。
    对争权夺利，台上的不正干，台下的拆台，干部更换频繁，轮流执政的村，采取竞选的办法产生支部书记。候选人先公开报名，发表施政演说，然后由党支部大会投票表决。
    两年来，全县采用这3种方式，调整了20个党支部班子，很有收效：
    一、拓宽了用人渠道，更新了用人标准，变革和完善了农村干部的选用机制。“三选并用”的办法打破了过去农村干部“划地为牢，就地取材”的办法，针对不同情况采取多形式、多方位的方法选择适合村情的支部书记。两年来，全县已有10个班子由县脱产干部回村任了支部书记，9个村从致富能人中选拔了“班长”，一个村民主竞选出了支部“带头人”，有效地促进了后进支部的总体改观。
    二、增强了支部班子的战斗力、凝聚力和感召力，使整个村的工作活了起来。县委宣传部一位干事去年回穆家庄村任支部书记后，在干部群众的配合支持下，从群众最关心、要求最迫切的问题入手，从公认的难点开刀，不到半年时间，就解决了征购、提留、计划生育、庄基地等方面多年的遗留问题，使这有名的“三类村”一跃成为先进村。
    三、探索出了一条把组织建设同经济建设结合起来的新路子。郭庄镇滋河店村去年新当选的党支部书记，原来就是致富能手，上任后，一方面抓党的各项方针政策的落实，一方面带领群众共同致富，一年就帮助50多户脱了贫。
