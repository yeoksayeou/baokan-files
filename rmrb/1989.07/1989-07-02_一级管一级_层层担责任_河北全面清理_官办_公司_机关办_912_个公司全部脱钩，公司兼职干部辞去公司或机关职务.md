Each level oversees one level, layer by layer taking responsibility
Hebei comprehensively cleans up "government-run" companies
All 912 companies run by government agencies have been decoupled, and cadres holding concurrent positions in companies have resigned from either the company or the government agency

Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 2nd. Reporter Chen Guoqi reports: Hebei Province is seriously cleaning up the issue of party and government officials holding concurrent positions in enterprises and companies. All 912 companies run by government agencies have been decoupled from the agencies; out of the 1298 government officials holding concurrent positions in companies, 1237 have resigned from their company positions, and the rest have resigned from their government positions to work full-time in the companies; all 275 retired officials involved in business have withdrawn, including 44 at the provincial and departmental level and 51 at the county and bureau level.

To prevent the company cleanup work from being superficial, Hebei Province organized the departments of industrial and commercial administration, organization and personnel, and discipline inspection to conduct a thorough and detailed investigation into the situation of party and government officials engaging in business and running enterprises, as well as holding concurrent positions in companies. Based on this, each level oversees one level, implementing a responsibility system layer by layer. The province established a leading group for cleanup and rectification, and provincial departments and various cities and counties have also generally established responsibility systems, clearly stipulating that if there are any oversights, the leaders of that level will be held responsible. Various levels of leaders have pressure and a sense of responsibility, making the company cleanup work in the entire province quite thorough.

    一级管一级　层层担责任
    河北全面清理“官办”公司
    机关办912个公司全部脱钩，公司兼职干部辞去公司或机关职务
    本报石家庄7月2日电  记者陈国琦报道：河北省认真清理党政机关干部在企业公司兼职问题。机关所办912个公司，已全部与机关脱钩；在公司兼职的1298名机关干部，已有1237名辞去公司职务，其余人辞去机关职务到公司任职；参与经商的275名离退休干部全部退出，其中地、厅级干部44人，县处级51人。
    为避免清理公司工作走过场，河北省组织工商行政管理、组织人事、纪检等部门，对全省党政机关干部经商办企业及在公司兼职情况进行了认真、细致的调查，分别不同情况分类研究。在此基础上，一级抓一级，层层搞责任制，省成立清理整顿领导小组，省直各部门，各地、市、县也普遍建立了责任制，明确规定：哪里出现疏漏，由哪里的领导负责。各级领导有压力、有责任感，全省清理公司工作搞得较彻底。
