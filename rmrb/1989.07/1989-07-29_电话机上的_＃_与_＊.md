When you have dialed a number and want to discuss something unrelated to the person you are calling with someone else by the phone, you only need to press the "*" key to temporarily disconnect the call. When you are ready to resume the conversation, simply release the "*" key.

There is also the "#" key. After dialing a number and hearing a busy signal, you can hang up and wait for a while. Then, press and release the "#" key. If the indicator light flashes a few times, it means the system will automatically try to connect the call for you. If you still hear a busy signal when you pick up the receiver, wait a bit longer and press the "#" key again until the call is connected.

    电话机上的“＃”与“＊”
    当你打通电话时，要同电话机旁的人谈及与受话人无关的事情时，你只须按下“＊”键，即可与对方暂时“切”断通话，当你重新与对方通话时，手指离开“＊”键就可以了。
    还有一个是“＃”键。当你拿起电话按齐对方电话号码后，听到占线忙音时，你可以放下电话等一阵，把“＃”键一按一放，见到那指示灯眨几下，表明已自动为你接通所需要的电话号码。如果拿起听筒还是“忙音”，可再等一阵，重新按一下“＃”键，直至接通。
