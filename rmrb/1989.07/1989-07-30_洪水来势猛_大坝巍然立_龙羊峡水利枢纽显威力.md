The Yellow River's upper reaches have experienced heavy rainfall for over a month. How has the Longyangxia Hydropower Project fared? Reporters Zheng Binpo and Zhang Mingqing visited Longyangxia and found that the dam has withstood the once-in-a-century flood peak of the Yellow River without any issues.

This year, the flood season in the upper reaches of the Yellow River arrived earlier and with greater intensity than in previous years. Starting from June 20th, the inflow into the Longyangxia Reservoir has been over 2,000 cubic meters per second daily, peaking at 3,560 cubic meters per second, and has remained high ever since. The reservoir's water storage has reached 13.077 billion cubic meters, an increase of 8 billion cubic meters compared to last year. Due to the main dam's elevation of 2,065.73 meters above sea level, along with the auxiliary dam, gravity piers, spillway, and other facilities, the project has far exceeded the design standards for defending against a 500-year flood peak. This has ensured the flood control and discharge in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River, guaranteed the construction of the Lijiaxia Hydropower Project, and secured the safety of the river regulation and land reclamation projects covering tens of thousands of acres in Guide and Jianzha counties in Qinghai Province.

During the flood peak period, the four generating units of the Longyangxia Hydropower Station operated under high water levels and heavy loads, all generating electricity. Over nearly seven months, they have generated 2.026 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, providing strong support for industrial and agricultural production.

    洪水来势猛　大坝巍然立
    龙羊峡水利枢纽显威力
    本报龙羊峡7月30日电  记者郅振璞、张铭清报道：黄河上游月余暴雨，龙羊峡水利枢纽工程状况如何？记者在龙羊峡看到，经受百年一遇黄河洪峰考验，大坝安然无恙。
    今年黄河上游汛期比往年来得早、来势猛。6月20日起，龙羊峡水库每日入库流量2000立方米／秒以上，最高达3560立方米／秒，且至今居高不下。水库蓄水达130.77亿立方米，比去年增加80亿立方米。由于这里主坝海拔高程达2065.73米，加上副坝、重力墩、溢洪道等设施，已远超出防御500年一遇洪峰的高程要求，因而确保了黄河中、上游防洪、排洪，保证了李家峡水电工程的施工及青海省贵德、尖扎等县数万亩治河造田工程的安全。
    在洪峰到来期间，龙羊峡水力发电厂4台机组，承受高水位、高负荷考验，全部发电，近7个月共发电20.26亿千瓦小时，有力地支援了工农业生产。
