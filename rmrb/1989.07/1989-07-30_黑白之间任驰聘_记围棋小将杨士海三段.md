In the world of Go, a young talent is rising. His name is Yang Shihai, and he is only 18 years old.

He made his mark during the fifth round of the China-Japan Go match when he emerged as the first player. In this match, he miraculously defeated Japan's Go star, Yida Jiki, a seventh-degree player. Yida is known for creating miracles; in the previous round of the China-Japan Go match, he consecutively defeated six Chinese masters, including Ma Xiaochun and Liu Xiaoguang, pushing the main commander Nie Weiping to the limit.

On May 16, Yang Shihai entered the match lightly equipped, using a small target and a carefree corner to lay a solid foundation. Yida Jiki, true to his reputation as a master, maintained an advantage from the beginning to the afternoon continuation. However, he had already clearly felt the strength of this unknown young player. As the game entered the endgame, Yang Shihai made a series of brilliant moves, turning the situation around. The audience, including Nie Weiping, Lin Haifeng, and Dai Takeo, were extremely surprised. After careful calculation, Yang Shihai was in a favorable position, possibly winning by one point or half a point. The two sides continued to fight until 6:40 PM when the referee announced that Yang Shihai won by half a point. Yida was quite surprised. The bewildered Yida Jiki asked familiar Chinese and Japanese players after the match: "Where did Yang Shihai come from?"

Yang Shihai was born into a family of Go enthusiasts in Leqing County, Zhejiang Province. His father and three elder brothers all enjoy playing Go. At the age of eight, he also became one of them. Family matches honed his skills. In just a few years, he "rose to prominence," becoming the top player in his family. In the spring of 1983, during the Chinese New Year, the 12-year-old Yang Shihai made his debut, winning first place in the Zhejiang Province Youth Go Tournament. Coach Jiang Guozhen of the provincial Go team discovered his talent, noticing his intuitive understanding of the game and his keen sense of local strategies, and took him under his wing for personal instruction.

In 1985, he participated in the National Youth Go Tournament as the third-place finisher and was invited to participate in the National Individual Tournament, unexpectedly defeating masters like Hua Yijang, an eighth-degree player. That year, he was still a non-ranked player. Afterward, Yang Shihai devoted himself to studying the game, seeking out matches with senior players like Ma Xiaochun and Yu Bin, and his skills improved day by day.

This year, Yang Shihai's performance is even more impressive. In the preliminary round of the 11th "New Sports Cup," he consecutively defeated Wang Qun, an eighth-degree player, and Yang Hui, a seventh-degree player, topping the group. In the second stage, he played white and won mid-game against the powerful Qian Yuping, a ninth-degree player. Yang Shihai said this was the game he played most satisfactorily.

Yang Shihai has been on a roll in recent years. This taciturn Go player has shown everyone with his every move: "I will soar between black and white."

### 黑白之间任驰聘——记围棋小将杨士海三段

    黑白之间任驰聘
    ——记围棋小将杨士海三段
    在围棋这个“黑白世界”里，有个年轻后生正在“走红”。他叫杨士海，今年才18岁。
    他是在出任第五届中日围棋擂台赛先锋时脱颖而出的。这次他且奇迹般地挫败了日本棋界“希望之星”依田纪基七段。依田七段是个创造奇迹的人，他在上届中日围棋擂台赛上连胜中方马晓春、刘晓光等六名高手，直逼主帅聂卫平棋圣。
    5月16日，杨士海轻装上阵，以小目和无忧角坚实布局。依田纪基不愧是高手，棋势从开始到下午续盘后都占优势，但他已明显地感觉到了眼前这位无名小将的力量，进入收官阶段，杨士海连施妙手，形势急转直下，对局室的聂卫平、林海峰、大竹英雄极为惊讶，细算结果，杨士海占优，可能胜一目或半目，双方一直杀到傍晚6点40分，裁判宣布杨士海以半目获胜，依田颇感意外。输得莫明其妙的依田纪基，在赛后连声问熟悉的中日棋手：杨士海究竟是从哪里冒出来的？
    杨士海出生于浙江省乐清县一个棋迷之家。他父亲及三个哥哥都爱在棋盘上搏杀。八岁时，他也成了其中的一员。家庭“对垒”使他棋艺大长。没几年，他“异军突起”，成了家里的头号种子选手。1983年春节，12岁的杨士海初出茅庐，夺得浙江省少儿围棋赛第一名。省围棋队的姜国震教练发现他下棋有灵气，局部感觉敏锐，把他招至军中，悉心指教。
    1985年，他以全国少年围棋赛第三名的身份被邀参加全国个人赛，出人意料地战胜了华以刚八段等高手。这年，他还是无段选手。此后，杨士海潜心钻研，找马晓春、俞斌等师兄对擂，棋艺日渐提高。
    今年，杨士海的战绩更令人刮目相看。在第11届“新体育杯”预赛中，他连胜王群八段、杨晖七段，名列小组榜首。第二阶段，他执白中盘战胜了实力雄厚的钱宇平九段，这盘棋杨士海自称是他下得最得意的一盘。
    杨士海近年来势头很猛，这位不善言谈的棋手，用自己的一招一式告诉人们：我要驰骋黑白间。
