Last March, we visited the Department of Science and Technology of the Indian government in New Delhi, and gained a lot of insights.

In recent years, the Indian government has increasingly recognized the importance of scientific and technological development to the country. In January 1983, it issued a policy statement to this effect. The basic goal of the statement is to promote India's own technological development while improving the absorption and efficiency of imported technology. To this end, the Indian government has established or improved several departments to promote scientific and technological development: the Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources was established in 1982; the Bureau of Biotechnology was upgraded to the Department of Biotechnology, and the Bureau of Environment was upgraded to the Department of Environment and Forests in 1986.

During the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1985-1990), the guiding principles for scientific and technological development were to help the national economy achieve sustained growth, self-reliance, and increased labor productivity. The focus was on accelerating food production, increasing employment opportunities, and improving labor productivity.

To strengthen the scientific and technological foundation, India will implement a "two-pronged strategy" for basic science development. This involves, on the one hand, strengthening the technological capabilities of strategic sectors such as energy, space, communications, agriculture, family planning, and defense. On the other hand, it involves conducting research and development in frontier disciplines to play a significant role in the future global technology market.

India's research and development expenditure as a percentage of GDP was 0.23% in the 1958-1959 fiscal year, rising to 0.85% in the 1982-1983 fiscal year, and further to 0.96% in the 1984-1985 fiscal year. About 85-90% of research and development funds come from direct or indirect support from the central and local governments, while about 15% comes from private investment. Currently, India has 150 universities and 3 million scientific and technological personnel. Each year, it can train approximately 200,000 scientific and technological personnel, including over 3,000 PhDs. India publishes about 3% of the world's research reports annually. In the 1985-1986 fiscal year, India registered 3,593 patents.

India's scientific and technological management institutions are divided into several levels. Above the cabinet, there is the Prime Minister's Science Advisory Council, which serves as the decision-making advisory body for the Prime Minister. The council was upgraded from the Cabinet Science Advisory Committee in 1986 and includes 18 independent science and technology experts. Its main tasks are to formulate science and technology policies and determine science and technology development tasks in collaboration with various science and technology departments. In 1986, the position of Prime Minister's Science Advisor was also established, who is directly responsible to the Prime Minister and is responsible for reviewing reports from the Prime Minister's Science Advisory Council and providing policy recommendations directly to the Prime Minister.

At the central level, there are 8 departments and 3 councils under the cabinet that are related to science and technology. These 8 departments are the Department of Science and Technology, the Department of Atomic Energy, the Department of Space, the Department of Electronics, the Department of Environment, the Department of Ocean Development, the Department of Non-Conventional Energy Sources, and the Department of Biotechnology. The 3 councils are the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the Council of Agricultural Research, and the Council of Medical Research. Each council has several dozen research laboratories. It can be seen that these departments fall into two types: one type is departments that have both research and management functions, such as the Department of Science and Technology and the Department of Ocean Development; the other type is departments that mainly conduct research, such as the Department of Atomic Energy and the Department of Space.

In addition, there is the Indian National Science Academy, whose main functions are to represent the government in participating in international science and technology organizations and to conduct academic and scholar exchanges.

Indian universities have some research organizations that perform both teaching and research functions and are under the jurisdiction of the University Grants Commission. There are also private research institutions, which also receive some government funding.

    印度科技发展政策和管理体制
    李大立
    去年3月，我们在印度新德里访问了印度政府科学技术部，颇多收获。
    近几年来，印度政府更加深刻地认识到科学技术的发展对国家的重要作用，并于1983年1月就此发布了政策声明。声明的基本目标是促进印度自己的技术开发，同时注意提高引进技术的吸收消化比例和效率。为此，印度政府先后设立或完善了若干促进科技发展的部门：1982年设立非常规能源部；1986年将生物技术局改为生物技术部，将环境局改为环境和森林部。
    在1985年到1990年的第七个五年计划中，科学技术发展的指导原则是帮助国家经济持续增长，自力更生，提高劳动生产率。重点项目将集中在加速食品生产、增加就业机会和提高劳动生产率等方面。
    印度为加强科学技术基础，将实行被称为“双叉战略”的基础科学发展政策，即一方面加强能源、空间、通信、农业、计划生育和国防等战略部门的技术能力，另一方面开展前沿学科的研究和发展工作，以便在未来的世界技术市场上起显著作用。
    印度研究和发展费用在国民生产总值中所占比例，1958—1959年度为0.23％，1982—1983年度上升到0.85％，1984—1985年度再次升到0.96％。研究发展费用的85—90％来自中央和地方政府的直接或间接支持，15％左右来自私人投资。目前印度有大学150所、科技人员300万人。每年能培养科技人员约20万人，其中包括博士3000多人。印度每年出版的研究报告，占世界年出版量的3％。1985—1986年度印度登记专利3593份。
    印度的科学技术管理机构分为若干层次。在内阁之上设有总理科学顾问理事会，作为总理的决策咨询机构。理事会1986年由内阁科学顾问委员会升级而成，其成员包括18名独立的科技专家，主要任务是与各科技部门一起，制定科技政策和确定科技发展任务。1986年还设立了直接对总理负责的总理科学顾问，负责鉴定总理科学顾问理事会提出的报告，并可直接向总理提出政策建议。
    中央级的机构包括设在内阁之下的8个与科技有关的部和3个理事会。这8个部分别是科学技术部、核能部、空间部、电子部、环境部、海洋开发部、非常规能源部和生物技术部。3个理事会是科学和工业研究理事会、农业研究理事会和医学研究理事会。每个理事会各有几十个研究实验室。可以看出，这些部门分属两种类型：一种是兼有研究和管理职能的部门，如科学技术部、海洋开发部等；另一种是主要从事研究的部门，如核能部、空间部等。
    此外还有印度国家科学院，它的职能主要是代表政府参加国际科技组织的活动和进行学术和学者的交流等。
    印度各大学有一些研究组织，它们执行教学和研究双重任务，并受大学基金委员会管辖。还有私人研究机构，它们也得到政府一些资助。
