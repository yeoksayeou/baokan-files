Beijing Solar Energy Research Institute invented this ceramic-type electric heating film, which can be directly sprayed or printed onto the surface of glass, ceramics, or enamel vessels, replacing conventional electric heating wires. Dongfang Energy-Saving Appliance Factory has developed electric shower heaters using this technology.
