Guanyin Cave is a secluded spot in the old revolutionary base area of Fan Kuai, Bai Li Xia in Sichuan Province. It is a place of beauty hidden deep in the mountains, unknown to many. The cave is located about 20 li (approximately 10 kilometers) from the mouth of the gorge on the southern slope of the mountain. The cave entrance faces a steep cliff, as if it might collapse at any moment and block the cave entrance. The sheer danger and treacherous appearance of the scene leave visitors in awe.

Inside the cave, there are large and small, hanging and standing, strange and varied stalactites and stalagmites. They resemble flying eaves and turning pillars, pavilions and terraces, colorful pavilions and soaring cranes, ancient temples and monasteries. The cave is a marvel of natural beauty, with a bewildering array of colors and shapes that create a fascinating underground palace.

Outside the cave, one can look up and see the vast sky and rolling hills; look straight ahead and see the intricate patterns of the rocks on the opposite cliffs; look down and admire the rolling waves of the river, which create a mist like snowflakes. It is truly a masterpiece of nature, a testament to the ingenuity of the natural world.

Entering the cave, one first comes to the front chamber, which is shaped like a crescent moon. The upper part of the cave entrance protrudes like the brim of a hat, and in the center, there is a stalactite that resembles a curved dragon, standing tall and seemingly ready to fly away at any moment. To the left, one can hear the sound of a wooden fish being struck. Legend has it that Guanyin, the Bodhisattva of Mercy, ordered a small monk to strike the wooden fish continuously, but in reality, it is a misty pool of water, like a steaming pot with its lid lifted. Water droplets fall from the cave walls onto the surface of the pool, creating a clear and monotonous dripping sound. Following the stone steps up from the front chamber, one reaches the middle chamber, which is spacious and can accommodate a thousand people. The ceiling is adorned with many large stalactites that resemble beautiful chandeliers, shaped like lotuses, lilies, azaleas, canopies, and peacocks. Among them, there is a tall and slender stalactite pillar that resembles the ancient Greek statue of Venus de Milo, pure white and smooth, and shrouded in a transparent veil of mist from the cave's water pool, giving a strong sense of beauty. The back chamber has a wide exit, allowing sunlight to pour in, revealing the clouds and water inside the cave. To the side, there sits a plump and lifelike statue of "Guanyin Bodhisattva," formed by the natural erosion of limestone. The statue has a complete set of features, sitting upright and lifelike. Throughout history, countless devotees have come here to burn incense and pray, leaving behind remnants of paper and ash that are still visible today. Not far from "Guanyin," there is a "bottomless pit," filled with mist, becoming colder the deeper one goes. To this day, no one has reached the bottom.

    观音洞
    陈显涪
    观音洞，是四川宣汉老区樊哙百里峡的一个“美在深山无人问”的去处。此洞位于峡口约20华里的南山腰，洞口面临陡峭的高岩，仿佛随时会倒下来封住洞涧，其势之恶，其态之险，令人惊叹不止。
    洞内，长满大大小小，或悬或立，千奇百怪，刚柔肥瘦的钟乳石，如飞檐转柱，似楼榭亭台，若彩阁飞鹤，像古庙寺刹，光怪陆离，相映成趣，宛如一座精心构筑的地下宫殿。
    洞外，仰视可见苍茫的天穹下起伏之峰峦；平视可经数对面的危岩下壁布的石纹；俯视可观赏江涛中滚翻的团团雪雾，实乃自然神韵，天工巧成。
    进得洞内，便是呈月牙形的前洞。洞口上端如帽舌探出，正中长有一形似曲虬的钟乳，翘首凌空，仿佛随时可飘飘欲去。往左探身，可闻敲击木鱼之声响。传说洞中观音令一小和尚终日不停敲打，却原是一如烟如岚的水潭，如掀盖的蒸笼一般，洞壁水珠滴落潭面，发出的清脆而单调的叮咚声。沿前洞石梯拾级而上，便来到中洞，这里宽畅空旷，可落座千人。洞顶许多硕大的石钟乳似美丽的吊灯，其状如莲、如百合、如杜鹃、如华盖、如孔雀。其间，还有一修长纤巧的钟乳石柱，颇似欧洲古代的断臂维纳斯，通体雪白如膏，加之洞内水潭气雾，像裹着一件透明的素纱，给人以强烈的美感。后洞有一阔大的出口，阳光从这里注入，洞内云容水态一览无余。洞侧，坐立一形象富态的“观音菩萨”，它是石灰岩溶液经大自然精心“浇铸”而成，五官俱全，正襟危坐，栩栩如生。古往今来，曾有无计其数的善男信女来此烧香拜佛，纸香残烬，历历可辨。离“观音”不远处，还有一“无底洞”，雾气蒙蒙，愈进愈寒，至今无人穷极。
