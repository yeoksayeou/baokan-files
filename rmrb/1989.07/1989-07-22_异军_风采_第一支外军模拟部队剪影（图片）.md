The roar of tanks and the smell of gunpowder fill the air. Laser electronic countermeasures are frequently launched, hitting their targets. Remote-controlled reconnaissance aircraft stand by, ready for action. A "blue army" dressed in camouflage uniforms is engaged in a fierce battle with the "red army." More than ten cameras and video recorders are simultaneously capturing the thrilling battle scenes, transmitting them to the wide screens in the training center's command room. Commanders are strategizing, issuing battle orders continuously. The computer records the victories and defeats of both the "red" and "blue" sides impartially. This is a scene from a drill at a certain training center of the People's Liberation Army. The "blue army" participating in the drill is the first foreign army simulation unit newly formed by our army. It engages with the "red army" using foreign military tactics and combat methods, changing the previous outcome of drills where the "red" always wins and the "blue" always loses. Its appearance has provided the troops with high-level, combat-oriented training.

    “异军”风采
    ——第一支外军模拟部队剪影
    铁甲隆隆，硝烟滚滚，激光电子对抗机频频发射击中目标，遥控侦察机整装待命，一支身着花斑迷彩戎装的“蓝军”正与“红军”打得难分难解。十多台摄像和录像机同时开动，把扣人心弦的战斗场面送到训练中心指挥部一排排宽敞的电视屏幕上。指挥员们运筹帷幄，不断下达战斗指令。电子计算机铁面无私地把“红”“蓝”双方的成败得失记录在案。这是解放军某训练中心的一次演习场面。参战的“蓝军”是我军新组编的第一支外军模拟部队。它以外军的战术思想、作战方法与“红军”较量，改变了以往演习一厢情愿的总是“红”胜“蓝”败的结局。它的出现，使部队受到了高水平的实战化训练。
