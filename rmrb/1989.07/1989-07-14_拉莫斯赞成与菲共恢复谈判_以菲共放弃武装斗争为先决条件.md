Ramos Supports Resumption of Talks with the CPP
With CPP's Abandonment of Armed Struggle as Prerequisite

	MANILA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos today expressed his support for the resumption of peace talks between the Philippine government and the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) and its political arm, the National Democratic Front (NDF). He emphasized, however, that the talks must be predicated on the CPP's abandonment of armed struggle.

	According to a report by the Philippine News Agency today, Jose Maria Sison, the CPP leader in exile, stated that the NDF is ready to hold "exploratory" talks with the government at any time. However, he rejected the precondition of laying down arms as a condition for resuming talks with the government.
