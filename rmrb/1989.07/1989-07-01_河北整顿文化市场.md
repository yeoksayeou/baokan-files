Hebei Province recently held a meeting to decide on further rectification and management of the cultural market.

Hebei Province demands that the cultural and publishing sectors genuinely prioritize social benefits, providing the people with healthy and beneficial spiritual products, and strictly managing the cultural market. If problems are found, not only will the responsible units be held accountable, but the relevant functional departments will also be dealt with. Products that inspire progress will be supported economically; those with low taste that are allowed to exist will have increased taxes and be restricted; those with serious issues such as obscenity and vulgarity will be rectified and punished economically in addition to being dealt with.

    河北整顿文化市场
    本报石家庄电　记者陈国琦报道：河北省最近召开会议，决定进一步整顿管理文化市场。
    河北省要求文化、出版界要真正把社会效益放在第一位，为人民提供健康有益的精神产品，严格文化市场管理。发现问题，不仅要追究有关单位的责任，还要对有关职能部门进行处理。对催人奋进的产品在经济上给予支持；对格调不高又允许存在的，增加税收，加以限制；对淫秽下流等问题严重的，除进行整顿处理外，要给以经济处罚。
