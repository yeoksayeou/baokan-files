Your newspaper's March 29, 6th edition published a letter to the editor titled "Bicycles Occupying Airplane Seats," which accurately reflected the issue. On January 22, there were 24 empty seats on the 3397th chartered flight. Among the passengers on that day's 3397th chartered flight were 16 former contract flight attendants from our bureau who are from Henan. They were dismissed and returned to Zhengzhou upon the expiration of their contracts, and their luggage and cargo were quite bulky. Since the cargo hold could not accommodate their 4 bicycles, they were placed in the empty seats at the rear of the cabin.

The occurrence of this issue indicates that our bureau still has weaknesses in production organization and management, as well as in adhering to strict regulations. We sincerely accept the criticism.

    民航广州管理局接受批评
    你报3月29日第六版刊登的《自行车占飞机座位》的读者来信，反映的问题属实。1月22日，3397次加班飞机上出现24个空位。乘坐当天3397次加班的旅客中，有16名原在我局工作的河南籍合同制空中服务员。她们因合同期满被辞退回郑州，所带的行李货物较多。她们的4辆自行车，因货舱装不下，便放到客舱后排空座位上。
    出现这一问题，说明我局在生产的组织管理和坚持严格的规章制度等方面还存在着薄弱环节。我们诚恳地接受批评。　民航广州管理局
