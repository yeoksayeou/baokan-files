The Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal is bustling with ships, presenting a lively scene of production. As one travels along the river, one will notice people carrying buckets, tightly following the ship convoys. What are they doing? Observe: some exchange goods for oil, some hand over cash to purchase oil from the engine room crew, and others steal oil when no one is looking. These people have formed a team, known as the "scraping oil teams." They roam among the ship convoys all day, refining the oil they scrape from the ships and then reselling it to individual boat owners, making substantial profits. Just in the upstream area of the Huai'an ship lock, there are more than a dozen wooden boats that make a living by scraping oil. According to reports, each boat can scrape 5 to 7 barrels of oil per day (each barrel is approximately 150 kilograms), and even the least can scrape 2 to 3 barrels. It is easy to imagine how much of our state-owned and collective ship convoys' oil supplies flow into this illicit channel every year. It is hoped that the relevant authorities and waterway management personnel will pay attention to this issue and not take it lightly.

### 京杭大运河上的“刮油队”

    京杭大运河上的“刮油队”
    京杭大运河上，船舶如梭，呈现出一派繁忙的生产景象。顺河而行，人们会发现在船闸上下游处一些人提着桶，死死缠住船队不放。他们在干什么？看吧：有的以物“换油”，有的递上现金从轮机师手中搭勾买油，有的则乘人不备偷油。这些人已形成一支队伍，人们称之为“刮油队”。他们整天游弋船队之间，把从轮船上刮来的油加工后转手倒卖给个体挂机船民，从中大获其利。仅淮安船闸上游处，就有以刮油为生的木船十几条。据反映，每条船每天刮油多则5至7桶（每桶约150公斤），少的也有2至3桶。可想而知，我们的一些国营、集体船队中的油料，一年有多少流入这条邪渠。希望有关主管部门和水运管理人员对此能引起重视，不可掉以轻心。
