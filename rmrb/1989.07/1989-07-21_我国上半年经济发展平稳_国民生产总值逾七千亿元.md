China's economy maintained stability in the first half of the year, with the national income exceeding 70 billion yuan.

Beijing, July 21 (Xinhua) -- A news release from the State Statistical Bureau today on the national economic performance in the first half of the year indicates that China's economy has developed relatively steadily. This is mainly reflected in the following areas:

Social effective supply has seen steady growth. Preliminary estimates show that the national income for the first half of the year surpassed 70 billion yuan, with a 5.7% increase over the same period last year when calculated at comparable prices. National income reached over 58 billion yuan, a 6% increase over the same period last year. The gap between agricultural and industrial growth has steadily narrowed. Summer grain and oil crops have seen a bumper harvest, with a total summer grain production of 93.55 million tons, an increase of 2.6 million tons over the highest level recorded in 1986. Market commodity sales have remained relatively stable. The total retail sales of social commodities for the first half of the year amounted to 41.6 billion yuan, an 18.3% increase over the same period last year. Price increases have shown signs of stabilization. The national retail price level for the first half of the year increased by 25.5% compared to the same period last year, mainly due to the carryover effect from last year. New price increases have only contributed to a 7 percentage point rise in the overall price level. Bank credit has seen a steady contraction. By the end of June, the difference between bank deposits and loans had decreased by 1.84 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year. In the first half of the year, the net withdrawal of currency amounted to 530 million yuan, whereas the same period last year saw a net injection of 880 million yuan.

Due to the short implementation period of the rectification and adjustment measures, the actual operations have mainly adopted administrative "short-term" measures, with fewer "fundamental" measures. Additionally, social unrest in some regions and the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing have affected the implementation of some policies, making it difficult to achieve the year's goals of controlling prices and reducing investment. Furthermore, the imbalances in social supply and demand, economic structural problems, poor industrial economic efficiency, and weak agricultural foundations that have accumulated over the past few years are difficult to reverse in the short term. The national economy has yet to emerge from its difficulties.

### 我国上半年经济发展平稳  国民生产总值逾七千亿元

    我国上半年经济发展平稳
    国民生产总值逾七千亿元
    本报北京7月21日讯　记者张国荣报道：国家统计局今天发布的上半年国民经济运行情况新闻公报表明：上半年我国经济发展相对平稳，主要表现在：
    社会有效供给稳步增长。初步测算，上半年国民生产总值突破7000亿元，按可比价格计算比去年同期增长5.7％；国民收入5800多亿元，比去年同期增长6％；农业与工业“温差”稳步缩小。夏收粮油作物喜获丰收，夏粮总产9355万吨，比历史最高水平的1986年增产26万吨；市场商品销售比较稳定。上半年社会商品零售总额4160亿元，比去年同期增长18.3％；物价涨势趋稳。上半年全国零售物价总水平比去年同期上涨25.5％，主要是翘尾巴因素的影响，新涨价因素只影响物价总水平上升7个百分点；银行信贷稳步紧缩。6月底，银行存贷差比年初减少184亿元。上半年，货币净回笼53亿元，而去年同期净投放88亿元。
    由于治理整顿实施的时间不长，实际操作中采取行政性的“治标”措施多，“治本”措施较少，加上部分地区社会动乱和北京反革命暴乱影响了一些政策效应的发挥，要实现今年控制物价、压缩投资的目标难度还很大。此外，前几年形成的社会供需不平衡、经济结构失调、工业经济效益差、农业基础脆弱等问题短期内也难以扭转，国民经济仍未走出困境。
