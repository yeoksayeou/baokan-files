    Hebei Establishes Eight Rules to Promote Integrity and Combat Corruption, Hunan Courts Strengthen Supervision

    Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, July 3rd. Correspondent Chen Guoqing reports: "To seriously rectify the party organization, restore the party's authority, we must genuinely combat corruption." This was a hot topic at the recent Hebei Provincial Party Committee's expanded meeting. Many attendees immediately pledged: first, to manage oneself and maintain integrity; second, to manage family members, children, and staff around them; third, to relentlessly fight against various forms of corruption.

    After repeated discussions, based on Hebei's actual situation, the meeting proposed eight regulations to stop and correct dishonest behavior and prevent the spread of corruption: county-level and above leaders, including retired cadres, and their spouses and children, are not allowed to engage in any form of business or enterprise, using their influence to buy and sell goods; party and government agencies are not allowed to purchase non-planned or planned imported luxury cars, nor are they allowed to rent cars for long periods; party members and cadres are not allowed to occupy public funds and goods in cities and towns, build private houses arbitrarily, or exceed the standard for housing; it is strictly forbidden to issue bonuses and gifts indiscriminately; party affairs agencies within the province do not entertain or dine with each other; leaders must strictly implement "two openness and one supervision," not arbitrarily approve requests, send favors, or open backdoors; it is strictly forbidden to give gifts and bribes to buy "official" positions or to receive gifts and bribes to sell "official" positions; the promotion and transfer of cadres must be handled by the organization and personnel departments according to policies and procedures; it is strictly forbidden for party members and cadres to accept gifts for weddings, funerals, and other events, use public vehicles for transportation, or hold large-scale ceremonies.

    The Hebei Provincial Party Committee emphasized that the fight against corruption must start from the leadership, implement a strict responsibility system, mobilize the masses to supervise and report, and severely punish those who violate the regulations, without leniency or mercy.

    Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, July 3rd. In Hunan, various levels of courts have strengthened their supervision mechanisms, promoting the construction of integrity. Last year, judicial personnel in the province resisted 10,937 instances of intervention, refused 7,111 invitations to dine, and rejected bribes and gifts totaling over 440,000 yuan in cash and goods. Of the 170,000-plus cases handled, the provincial People's Congress Standing Committee's law enforcement inspection determined that 98% were handled correctly or basically correctly.

    In recent years, various levels of people's courts in Hunan have mainly taken the following five measures to strengthen the supervision of judicial personnel's integrity:

    Posting integrity announcements, courts have publicized regulations on integrity from higher courts and their own, making them known to the public; appointing image supervisors for judicial personnel, who closely monitor the thoughts, work, discipline, and style of judicial personnel; selecting discipline liaison officers, who are democratically elected by party members and cadres in the courts, chambers, and people's courts to report disciplinary information at any time; conducting case follow-up investigations, where courts send opinion forms to plaintiffs, defendants, defense attorneys, and agents in some concluded key cases, seeking their opinions on the enforcement situation and work style of the handling personnel; maintaining the court president's open day, listening to the public's opinions and demands regarding judicial personnel.

    河北约法八章倡廉反腐  湖南各级法院强化监督
    本报石家庄7月3日电　记者陈国琦报道：“认真整顿党组织，重振党威，就要实打实地反腐败。”这是最近召开的河北省委全委扩大会的一个热门话题。不少与会者当场立下“军令状”：一要管好自己，洁身自好；二要管好家属子女及身边工作人员；三要敢于同各种腐败现象作不懈斗争。
    经过反复讨论，从河北实际情况出发，会议提出8条制止和纠正不廉洁行为、杜绝腐败现象滋生和蔓延的规定：县以上领导干部包括离退休干部的配偶和子女，不准个人以任何形式经商办企业，利用领导干部的影响倒买倒卖；党政机关不准购买计划外或计划分配的进口豪华型小汽车，不准长期租用小汽车；党员干部不准在城镇贪占公众款物，乱建私房，不得超标准多占住房；严禁滥发奖金实物；省内党务机关工作往来不搞宴请、不陪餐；领导干部要严格执行“两公开一监督”，不得滥批条子，送人情，开后门；严格禁止送礼行贿买“官”及收礼受贿卖“官”，干部提拔调配由组织人事部门按政策和程序进行；严禁党员、干部婚丧嫁娶收受财礼、用公车迎送，大操大办。
    河北省委强调，反腐败要从领导做起，实行严格的责任制，要发动群众，监督举报，对违犯规定者要从严惩处，不姑息，不手软。
    本报长沙7月3日电　湖南省各级法院强化监督机制，促进了廉政建设。去年，全省法院干警抵制说情10937人次，拒绝请吃7111人次，拒贿拒礼的现金和实物折款共44万多元。审理的17万多起案件，经省人大常委会组织的执法大检查认定，办理正确或基本正确的在98％以上。
    近年来，湖南省各级人民法院，主要采取了5个方面的措施，强化对干警的廉政监督：
    张贴廉政公告，法院把上级法院和自身制定的有关廉政的规定，公布于众；聘请干警形象监督员，对法院干警的思想、工作、纪律和作风认真监督；选任纪检联络员，在法院庭、室和人民法庭民主选举一名党员干部担任纪检联络员，随时反映违纪信息；开展案件跟踪调查，对部分办结的重点案件，法院向案件的原告、被告、辩护人、代理人同时发出征求意见函，征求对办案人员执法情况和工作作风的意见；坚持院长接待日，听取人民群众对法院干警的意见和要求。
