Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 23rd.

The reporter learned today from the Youth Games delegation leaders' meeting that the State Sports Commission has decided: the Second National Youth Games, to be held in Shenyang on September 6, will not organize a government-funded observation team. This is another major reform following the decision not to hold a large-scale group gymnastics performance at the opening ceremony of the Youth Games and not to set up a presidium.

In the past, inviting relevant leaders or personnel to observe major comprehensive sports events at public expense has become a common practice.

When discussing this issue, Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, pointed out: "This reform is a measure for the clean governance of party and government agencies."

Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, July 23rd.

"The Second National Youth Games will not calculate the total points and medal rankings." This was announced today by Wu Shaozu, the director of the State Sports Commission, at the Youth Games delegation leaders' meeting. He said that the important purpose of holding the Youth Games is to cultivate and discover sports reserve talents and promote the improvement of China's sports level, and the rankings of the competitions are not the sole standard for measuring the sports level of each region.

    第二届青运会将进行多项重大改革
    不计团体总分和金牌名次，不搞公费参观团
    新华社沈阳7月23日电  （记者王健民）记者今天从青运会代表团团长会议上获悉，国家体委决定：9月6日在沈阳召开的第二届全国青少年运动会将不搞公费参观团。这是继青运会开幕式不搞大型团体操，不设主席团之后的又一项重要改革。
    过去大型综合运动会邀请有关领导或人员公费参观已成惯例。
    谈到这个问题时，国家体委主任伍绍祖指出：“这一改革是党政机关廉政建设的一项措施。”
