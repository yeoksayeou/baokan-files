Mosques were known as "Gongtang" during the Tang Dynasty and "Gongbaotang" during the Song Dynasty. Starting from the Yuan Dynasty, they were named "Qingjiaosi," "Zhenjiaosi," and "Qingtang" according to the meaning of "Qingzhen." By the Ming and Qing Dynasties, "Qingzhen Temple" had become the common term for Islamic places of worship. The names of mosques often include the name of the location to distinguish them, such as the Id Kah Mosque in Kashgar, Xinjiang, the Cangzhou Mosque, and the Tongxin Mosque.

China places great emphasis on the architecture of mosques. Generally, there are two main styles: one is the Arab style, characterized by round-arched prayer halls and pointed minarets. Examples include the Huaisheng Mosque on Guangta Road in Guangzhou, which was built during the Tang Dynasty by the Arab Wangan. The mosque consists of a light tower and a temple. Another example is the Nanguan Mosque in Yinchuan, which is also built in the Arab architectural style. The other style is the Chinese palace style, characterized by courtyard-style prayer halls and pagoda-style minarets. A notable example is the Huajue Temple in Xi'an. This temple is vast and grand, with five courtyards and buildings such as the main hall, lecture hall, and bathhouse. The main buildings include the front and rear halls, Shengxin Tower, Fenghuang Pavilion, and Chaoyang Hall, collectively known as the "Five Phoenixes Facing the Sun Hall." The Niujie Mosque in Beijing is said to have been established by Nasruddin during the early Northern Song Dynasty. Other notable mosques include the Xianhe Temple in Yangzhou and the Qingjing Temple in Quanzhou, Fujian Province.

Mosques with Arab architectural styles are particularly striking for their domes, as Islam reveres the color green. The domes and their decorations are all green. The number of domes in a mosque, based on its size and scale, can be one, three, or five, but never an even number. The largest dome has a crescent moon symbol at its highest point.

Most mosques are built in beautiful environments, surrounded by flowers, trees, and greenery, creating a serene, spacious, and bright atmosphere, as well as a solemn and reverent ambiance.

    清真寺小考
    清真寺在唐代称“礼堂”，宋代称“礼拜堂”。从元代开始，按“清真”之意，取名为“清教寺”、“真教寺”、“清真堂”等。到明清时期，“清真寺”已成为伊斯兰教寺院的通称了。只不过把地名加在清真寺前面以示区别，如新疆喀什艾提卡尔清真寺、沧州清真寺、同心清真寺等。
    我国对清真寺的建筑非常讲究，从建筑样式上大体可分为两种：一种是阿拉伯的风格，其表现形式是圆形拱顶的礼拜殿和尖顶的宣礼楼，如广州市光塔路的怀圣寺，它始建于唐代，为阿拉伯人宛尕斯所建，由光塔和寺院组成。还有银川南关清真寺，其样式也是按阿拉伯建筑风格修建的。另一种是中国宫殿式的风格，其表现形式是庭堂式的礼拜堂和楼阁式的宣礼塔，如著名的西安化觉寺。其寺规模宏大，殿宇雄伟，全寺分五进院落，有大殿、讲堂、浴室等建筑物。主体建筑为前后大殿、省心楼、凤凰亭、朝阳殿，合称为“五凤朝阳殿”。北京牛街清真寺，相传北宋初年由纳速鲁丁创建。另外还有扬州仙鹤寺、福建省泉州市清净寺等。
    富有阿拉伯建筑风格的清真寺，特别引人注目的是它的穹顶，因为伊斯兰教崇尚绿色，而穹顶和其装饰都为绿色。清真寺的穹顶根据寺的大小规模而分为一、三、五个单数，而忌双数。其中最大的一个穹顶高处装有月牙形标志。
    清真寺大都是建筑在环境比较优美的地方，周围有花草树木，清净幽雅，宽敞明亮，庄严肃穆。
