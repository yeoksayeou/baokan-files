	Senior Diplomat Accused of Espionage Case: FBI Begins Investigation

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 22 — The United States senior career diplomat Felix Bloch is under investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation for allegedly providing secret intelligence to the Soviet Union.

	The news of Bloch's investigation was revealed last night by American media, and the U.S. State Department subsequently confirmed the information.

	According to reports, Bloch had handed over a briefcase to a Soviet intelligence officer in Vienna, and his actions were recorded by American intelligence personnel. The FBI suspects Bloch of being a Soviet spy.

	The 54-year-old Bloch has been engaged in diplomatic work for 30 years and is currently the director of the Political and Economic Affairs Office of the European and Canadian Affairs Bureau of the State Department. He began contact with Soviet intelligence officers three years ago.

	Bloch has been suspended from duty, and his State Department access credentials were confiscated a month ago.
