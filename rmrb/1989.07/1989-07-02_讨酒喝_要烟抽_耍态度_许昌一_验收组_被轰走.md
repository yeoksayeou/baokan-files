Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 2nd

A "verification team" from the Xuchang City Health Bureau in Henan Province, which demanded drinks and cigarettes at every meal, was driven away by the verified unit, the Changge County Health Bureau.

On May 2nd, a team of five from the Xuchang City Health Bureau's "Verification Team for the Implementation of the New Accounting System" arrived in Changge. During lunch, one member of the team saw that the table was set with eight cold dishes and beer, and complained, "Bring some spicy liquor, beer is like tea!" Another said, "Go get some cigarettes!" The county health bureau's office director, Li Haijiang, who was in charge of the reception, had no choice but to follow the instructions and buy two bottles of high-quality Baofeng liquor and a pack of Grade A Zhongyuan cigarettes. After the team members had a good drink, six more hot dishes were served, and they continued drinking until around 2:30 PM. They then visited the Zengfusi Township Health Clinic and returned to the county seat around 4 PM.

When the team members saw that dinner was a simple meal, they were again dissatisfied and said, "Bring more alcohol, we didn't drink enough at lunch." They also said, "It doesn't matter if I drink or not, but the driver should have a good drink." When they learned that the county health bureau had a rule that only one meal could be provided for visitors from higher levels, the team's driver went to the counter, took two bottles of spicy liquor, and used his teeth to open the bottle caps. He poured a large cup for each person, scowled, and said angrily, "We'll buy our own alcohol to drink, we don't need their hospitality!" That night, the five team members drank from 6:30 PM until after 10 PM.

County Health Bureau Director Chen Yiqing learned about the team's behavior and immediately stated, "We do not welcome such a verification team that demands food and drink. We would rather be ranked last than welcome them. Notify them to leave in the morning." On the morning of May 3rd, after sending the verification team away, they also wrote a letter to the city health bureau. The letter said: "The work style of the New Accounting System Verification Team goes against the principle of clean governance and damages the reputation of the city bureau. We in Changge do not welcome such a verification team. We request that the verification team members be adjusted and then come to verify our work."

    讨酒喝　要烟抽　耍态度
    许昌一“验收组”被轰走
    新华社郑州7月2日电（通讯员宏伟、春生、君健）顿顿讨酒喝要烟抽的河南省许昌市卫生局的一个“验收组”，被验收单位——长葛县卫生局轰走。
    今年5月2日，许昌市卫生局“新会计制度执行情况验收组”一行5人驱车来到长葛。中午吃饭时，验收组中的一人见餐桌上摆的是8个凉盘和啤酒，不满地说：“来点辣酒，啤酒当茶喝！”另一位说：“再去拿条烟！”负责接待工作的县卫生局办公室主任李海江，只得按吩咐又买了两瓶优质宝丰酒和一条甲级中原烟。验收组的人“六六大顺”一阵后，又上了6个“热盘”，一直喝到下午两点多。随后，他们到增福庙乡卫生院转了一圈，下午4点来钟就回到了县城。
    验收组的同志见晚饭为他们安排的是一顿便饭，又十分不满地说：“再弄点酒，中午都没喝好。”又说：“俺喝不喝没啥，得叫司机喝得劲。”当他们得知县卫生局有规定，上级来人只破例招待一顿，其余都是便饭时，验收组的司机转身到柜台前拿了两瓶辣酒，用牙撬开瓶盖，每人跟前倒了一大杯，板着脸生气地说：“咱自己买酒喝，不用人家招待！”这天晚上，验收组的5个人从6点半一直喝到10点多钟。
    县卫生局长陈义卿了解到这个验收组的所作所为后，当即表态：“像这样要吃要喝的验收组，我们宁可落个倒数第一名，也不欢迎他们。明天早上就通知他们走。”5月3日一早，他们把验收组的人打发走后，同时给市卫生局写了一封信。信中说：“新会计制度验收组的作风违背了为政清廉的宗旨，损坏了市局的声誉。这样的验收组我们长葛不欢迎。我们请求对验收组人员进行调整后，再对我县工作进行验收。”
