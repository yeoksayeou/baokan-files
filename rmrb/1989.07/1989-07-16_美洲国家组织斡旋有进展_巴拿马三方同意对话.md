The Organization of American States (OAS) mediation team, which is on its third visit to Panama to seek a solution to the crisis, announced yesterday that the Panamanian military, pro-government parties, and opposition parties have agreed to unconditional dialogue. The dialogue is set to begin this afternoon.

Since the Panamanian authorities declared the May elections invalid, the OAS has been engaged in political mediation efforts. The delegation, composed of the foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, and Trinidad and Tobago, as well as the OAS Secretary-General, is currently on its third visit to Panama. In a statement issued yesterday, the delegation announced that all three sides in Panama have confirmed their acceptance of the proposal for dialogue. The dialogue will have no predetermined agenda, no preconditions, and will not exclude any topics.

While the OAS is conducting its mediation efforts, the United States and some Latin American countries are also engaged in intense negotiations regarding the Panama crisis. Some Latin American countries hope to reach an agreement on Noriega's relinquishment of power, as failure of the OAS mediation could lead to direct U.S. military intervention in Panama.

    美洲国家组织斡旋有进展
    巴拿马三方同意对话
    本报加拉加斯7月16日电  记者朱满庭报道：为寻求解决巴拿马危机进行第三次斡旋活动的美洲国家组织代表团昨天宣布，巴拿马军方、亲政府政党和反对派政党3方已就进行无条件对话达成协议，对话将于今天下午开始举行。
    自巴拿马当局宣布5月份的大选无效后，美洲国家组织一直在进行政治斡旋活动，由厄瓜多尔、危地马拉和特立尼达和多巴哥3国外长以及美洲国家组织秘书长组成的代表团现在正对巴拿马进行第3次访问。在昨天发表的一项公报中，代表团宣布巴拿马3方都已确认接受对话的建议，对话无预定日程，无先决条件，不排除任何议题。
    在美洲国家组织进行斡旋活动的同时，美国和一些拉美国家也围绕着巴拿马危机进行着紧张的斡旋，一些拉美国家希望就诺列加放弃权力一事达成协议，因为如果美洲国家组织的斡旋失败，巴拿马可能面临美国进行直接军事干涉的危险。
