The Second National Chess King Tournament opened today in Harbin. Jiangsu chess player Xu Tianhong, smiling, maneuvered his pieces to surround the Black Dragon River province's Zhao Guorong, capturing his main general and successfully overcoming a difficult challenge.

Xu Tianhong opened with a central cannon, to which Zhao Guorong responded with a "screening horse." After about 10 moves, Zhao Guorong's cannon on the 7th file attacked the opponent's bottom advisor, appearing fierce but lacking a killing move. Xu Tianhong seized the opportunity, using his 8th file chariot to block the "elephant's eye," transforming the initial cannon into a double cannon on the 7th file. The horse on the left side then crossed the river to capture the central elephant, forming a strong offensive with chariots, horses, and double cannons. Zhao Guorong's camp had horses, cannons, and a bottom elephant all within the range of the opponent's big cannon. Zhao Guorong was forced to abandon his horse and flee with his general, but lacking any rescue troops, he had no choice but to surrender.

Hebei's Li Laiqun played against Singapore's Zheng Xiangfu, resulting in a double advisor, double soldier, chariot, and cannon versus a single advisor, double soldier, chariot, and horse. Refusing to draw, Li Laiqun exploited the opponent's weakness of missing an elephant, first capturing the opponent's small soldier, then crossing the river with his troops, directly advancing to the nine palaces. After 61 moves, the chariot, cannon, and soldiers formed a checkmate. Hu Ronghua waited patiently for challengers.

    第二届象棋棋王赛开盘
    本报哈尔滨7月1日电  江苏棋手徐天红面带笑容，挥车跃马将黑龙江赵国荣城池团团围住，将其主将生擒，从而顺利闯过险关。第二届象棋棋王赛是今天下午在这里揭幕的。
    徐天红先架中炮，赵国荣应以“屏风马”。战至10余回合时，赵国荣7路炮打对方底相，貌似凶狠却无杀招。徐天红抓住时机，过河的8路车堵“象眼”，继而当头炮演变为7路叠炮，左路马乘虚跃河踏中象，形成车马双炮归边的强大攻势。赵国荣营内马炮底象都在对方大炮射程之内，赵国荣被迫弃马逃将，但是苦于无救驾之兵，只好俯首称臣。
    河北李来群与新加坡郑祥福战至双相双士车炮对单相双士车马，不肯做和，抓住对方少一只象的弱点，先谋去对方小卒，然后挥兵渡河，直逼九宫，战至61回合，车炮兵构成绝杀。胡荣华以逸待劳，静候挑战者。　（梁学增）
