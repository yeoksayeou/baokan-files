Soviet Marshal at U.S. House Hearing Says U.S. Should Adopt Reconciliatory Stance on Arms Control

The former Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Union and high-level military advisor to Gorbachev, Marshal Akhromeyev, today attended a hearing of the U.S. House Armed Services Committee. He urged the United States to adopt a more reconciliatory stance on arms control.

He told the legislators that if the United States does not adopt a more reconciliatory stance on some key issues of concern to the Soviet Union, the prospects for breakthroughs in arms control will be bleak.

Akhromeyev is the highest-ranking Soviet official to attend a U.S. congressional meeting. During the more than four-hour hearing, he said the Soviet Union has significantly reduced tank production, producing only 1,700 tanks this year. By the end of 1990, the scale of Soviet tank production will be reduced by 40%. He emphasized to the U.S. legislators that if the United States continues to establish a space-based anti-missile defense system, it would be inappropriate to conclude a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons.

    苏联元帅在美众院听证会上说
    美在军备控制上应有和解立场
    本报华盛顿7月21日电  苏联前总参谋长、戈尔巴乔夫的高级军事顾问阿赫罗梅耶夫元帅今天出席美国众议院军事委员会的听证会，要求美国在军备控制方面采取更为和解的立场。
    他对议员们说，如果美国在苏联所关心的一些关键问题上不采取更和解的立场，那么军备控制要取得突破的前景将是渺茫的。
    阿赫罗梅耶夫是苏联出席美国国会会议的最高级别官员。他在4个多小时的听证会上说，苏联已大大削减了坦克生产，今年只生产1700辆。到1990年底，苏联坦克生产的规模将减少40％。他向美国议员会强调，如果美国继续建立以宇宙为基地的反导弹防御系统，那么缔结一项削减远程核武器的条约将是不适合的。
