Recently, I received a book by Mr. Kong Shoushan titled "The Aesthetics of Clothing" (published by Shanghai Science and Technology Press), which sparked some thoughts in me.

I went to Shanghai and saw many sweaters on the market with intricate embroidery and beads on the chest, which were quite elaborate. The area these decorations occupied was not appropriate. Either the entire front was embroidered, making it very luxurious, or three-quarters or four-fifths were removed, leaving a bit as an accent. Both would be beautiful. This is an issue of formal beauty, and I deeply regret the low level of the designers. However, this problem has persisted in the Shanghai sweater market for a long time. So, I couldn't help but ask an informed person, "Why don't you remind the designers to pay attention to the rhythm of the decorations on the clothing?" The response was, "A large number of Shanghai's clothing is sold to people from other regions, and they like these styles. If the embroidery is less, it will affect sales. The demand for these styles is high, so factories will naturally produce them in batches!"

Who creates clothing culture? Many people would answer without hesitation, "The clothing designers, of course!" Now, it seems this conclusion is quite dubious!

Clothing designers only create new styles and matching schemes, guiding the clothing culture but not completing it. Consumers, based on their own cultural standards, selectively accept and recreate in their own dressing, thus completing it in a group form. The level of Chinese clothing culture is not high, and the responsibility cannot be solely placed on the designers; the more important aspect lies with the consumers.

For the works of designers, the primary issue is whether they can be noticed by consumers and whether they can adapt to the consumers' aesthetic tastes. If consumers can accept them, designers can play a guiding role. If consumers do not buy, the designers' work would be meaningless. If the consumer group's quality is low, substandard (culturally) products will have a market. As long as they sell well and make a profit, factories will continue to produce them. Thus, substandard products will always exist, and the improvement of China's clothing culture level will be severely hindered. Conversely, if the consumer group's quality is high and substandard products are not wanted, then factories will have to seek help from excellent designers to maintain the enterprise's survival. In this sense, consumers also influence and guide enterprises and designers.

Paris can lead the world in fashion trends, with many comprehensive factors, and the overall cultural quality of Parisians is an important factor. A few years ago, when the Arc de Triomphe was under repair and scaffolding was erected, the construction department could not tolerate the scaffolding ruining Paris's cityscape, so they covered it neatly with white cloth and had an artist paint a large painting on it. Thus, during the construction period, pedestrians temporarily could not see the Arc de Triomphe but enjoyed a piece of art. This not only maintained the beauty of the square but also added new artistic atmosphere to Paris. Such examples are common in Paris. Parisians are constantly immersed in a rich artistic atmosphere, influenced by what they see and hear, gradually improving their aesthetic tastes. Facing such a consumer group, substandard products would have no market. It can be said without hesitation that it is the overall cultural environment of France that determines Paris's leading position in fashion worldwide.

Therefore, I believe that to improve China's clothing culture level, we should start from two aspects: On one hand, designers should thoroughly study the aesthetic psychology of various consumers, or more precisely, the aesthetic models. On the premise of basically meeting their needs, gradually improve their cultural level. The most important thing to note is the extent of the improvement. If the extent is too large, consumers will not accept it. Taking sweaters as an example, if consumers like heavy embroidery, then the embroidery pattern can be made more unified, even developing towards fully embroidering the front. There are many such compromise solutions. It should be said that the basic skill of clothing designers lies in this, neither fully expressing their individuality nor fully catering to consumers' tastes, but rather a method of "two accommodations." This "two accommodations" design method should be strongly advocated in today's China. On the other hand, various media should popularize the principles and knowledge of clothing aesthetics, gradually making more consumers understand and master aesthetics, thereby beautifying themselves.

I believe that Mr. Kong's "The Aesthetics of Clothing" is different from purely theoretical aesthetics books and does not limit itself to discussing how to dress. It seeks to delve into and simplify the aesthetics of clothing, making it a good book for both clothing designers and consumers to read. Publishing such a book is naturally more laborious than designing a piece of clothing, but it is also more meaningful.

    民族素质与服饰文化
    聂昌硕
    最近收到了孔寿山先生著的一本谈穿着艺术与科学的书《服装美学》（上海科学技术出版社出版），产生了一点联想。
    我去上海，看到市场上销售的许多毛衫，胸前绣了许多花和珠片，很繁琐，而这些装饰所占的面积是很不恰当的。要么前胸整个绣满，显得十分富丽；要么去掉3／4或4／5，留一点做为点缀，两者都将是美的。这是一个形式美中的问题，我深怪设计师的水平低下。可是，这个问题在上海毛衫市场上持续已久，于是，我忍不住询问了一位知情者：“你们为什么不提醒设计师，注意一下服装上的饰物节奏问题呢？”得到的答复是：“上海的服装很大的数量是销给外地人的，他们喜欢这样的款式，花绣少了会影响销量的。这类款式的需求量很大，厂家当然要成批地投产喽！”
    服饰文化是谁创造的？许多人会不假思索地回答：“是服装设计师啊！”现在看来这个结论很值得怀疑了！
    服装设计师只创造了新颖的款式与搭配方案，对服饰文化只做了引导工作，而没有完成。消费者依据自己的文化水准，有选择地接受，在自己的穿着打扮中，经过再创造，才以群体的形式完成的。中国服饰文化的水准不高，不能仅由设计师一方承担责任，更重要的方面还在消费者那里。
    对于设计师的作品，首要的问题是能否被消费者看中，能否适应消费者的审美口味。消费者能够接受，设计师才能起到引导作用。如若消费者不买，设计师的工作就无社会意义了。消费群体的素质较低，那么劣质（指文化）产品就会有市场。只要好销，能够盈利，厂家就会永远生产下去。于是，欠美产品就会永远存在，中国服饰文化水平的提高将严重受阻。反之，若消费群体的素质较高，欠美产品没人要，那么厂家就不得不寻求优秀设计师的帮助，以维持企业的生存。从这个意义上说，消费者也影响引导着企业和设计师。
    巴黎能够领导世界的时装潮流，有着众多的综合因素，巴黎人的整体文化素质颇高是重要的因素之一。前几年，凯旋门维修时支起了脚手架，建筑部门不能容忍脚手架破坏了巴黎的市容，用白布将它整齐地遮盖起来，请一位装饰画家在布上作了一幅巨大的画，于是在施工期间，行人暂时看不到凯旋门了，却欣赏到了一幅艺术作品。这样做，不但保持了广场的美观，同时又为巴黎增添了新的艺术气氛。这类事例在巴黎常可见到。巴黎人就是这样常年地沉浸在浓郁的艺术气氛中，耳濡目染，潜移默化，大大提高了审美情趣。面对这样的消费群体，劣质产品就不会有市场了。可以毫不含糊地说，是法国整体文化环境决定了巴黎时装在世界上的领先地位的。
    因此，我以为要提高中国的服饰文化水平应从两方面着手：一方面，设计师应好好地研究各类消费者的审美心理，准确地说是审美模式，在基本上满足他们的需求的前提下，逐步地提高其文化层次。最需注意的是提高的幅度问题，幅度过大，消费者就接受不了了。以毛衫为例，如果消费者喜欢重绣，那么可使绣花花型更整体，甚至向绣满前胸的方向发展。这类折中方案是很多的。应该说，服装设计师的基本功就在于此，既不能完全表现自己的个性，也不能完全迎合消费者的口味，而是兼顾双方的“两就就”方法。这种“两就就”设计法在当今中国应该大力提倡。另一方面，各种传播媒介应当普及服饰美的原理和知识，逐步使更多的消费者了解美学，掌握美学，以此来美化自己。
    我以为，孔先生的《服装美学》既不同于纯理论的美学书，又不限于具体地谈如何穿着，力求深入浅出地探讨服装的美学问题，对于服装设计师和消费者，都不失之为可以读的好书。出这样一本书要比设计一件服装自然费力得多，但也有意义得多。
