	Li Zongxiu, a farmer from Luohua Village, Heshan Township, Rizhao County, Shandong Province, is the first generation of rural experts who developed the "New Red Star," a semi-dwarf, high-quality apple variety that has been the "queen" of apples for over 30 years.

	One autumn night in 1984, Li Zongxiu squatted on the southeast hill of Luohua Village, silently smoking a cigarette. That morning, at a village party members' meeting, he was elected as the branch secretary. The situation before him was grim:

	The village party branch had changed leadership twice in one year, and the village cadres had low prestige among the villagers. Land had been contracted to households, and agricultural production materials had been allocated to households at a discounted price, but there was still a collective debt of 780,000 yuan from previous years. The villagers, each with 2.3 mu of land, were struggling to make a living...

	This man, approaching 40, felt the weight of his responsibilities. As soon as the meeting ended, he found himself on this hill.

	Twenty-one years earlier, on a similar night, on this barren hill, Li Zongxiu had made up his mind to study orchard technology. During his 20-plus years as an orchard technician, this farmer who grew up eating sweet potatoes carried dried sweet potatoes and pancakes, visiting all the major fruit research institutes and experimental bases in the province, and traveling to the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Fruit Research Institute and fruit research institutes in Liaoning and Hebei provinces to learn and seek advice. He formed deep teacher-student relationships with many famous fruit experts, accumulating a wealth of fruit management technology and experience. Li Zongxiu had long realized that the way to break free from the poverty of a remote and backward mountainous area was to develop the mountainous fruit industry.

	Thinking of the fruit industry, Li Zongxiu immediately thought of his "New Red Star."

	In the autumn of 1982, while studying at the Qingdao Agricultural Science Institute, Li Zongxiu learned about the "New Red Star." He immediately went to the Taishan Fruit Experimental Base, but the experimental site did not allow visitors. This did not deter Li Zongxiu. Every morning at dawn, he would squat on the hillside outside the garden, watching the workers manage the fruit trees. When hungry, he would eat a pancake, and when thirsty, he would drink some cold water. After seven days, he moved the "Gods." The experimental site made an exception and allowed him to enter the lush "New Red Star" experimental garden, giving him two tree cuttings to take back for observation and experimentation. That night, Li Zongxiu, carrying the two "New Red Star" tree cuttings given to him by the workers, rushed back to Luohua, grafting the hope onto the old fruit trees.

	1984 was a year of great change in rural reform. That winter, Li Zongxiu organized the villagers to visit and learn from other places several times. The village cadres came to know the "New Red Star," and the villagers also came to know the "New Red Star." In the spring of 1985, at a village meeting, Luohua Village decided to develop a "New Red Star" orchard on the barren hills in the southeast of the village.

	Before the frost had completely melted, a battle to transform the barren hills began on the southeast hills of Luohua Village. Li Zongxiu took the lead in taking on the most difficult land plot and completed the task first. The men of the village joined the battle, as did the women and the elderly, along with relatives and friends invited from other villages. In just one month, they cleared 220 mu of standard farmland. That winter, they planted 10 mu of fruit seedlings in the east of the village. In the spring of 1986, Li Zongxiu acquired 10,000 half-grown "New Red Star" seedlings through various channels and planted them on this 220 mu of hopeful land.

	An orchard does not yield results immediately. The villagers understood this, and they shouldered the burden with the branch secretary.

	The wages for transforming the hills were owed, but they had no complaints.

	The wages for managing the orchard were also owed, but they still had no complaints.

	In 1987, Li Zongxiu led the villagers to develop another 200 mu of "New Red Star," using their own seedlings.

	The young orchard needed investment, but how to solve the funding problem? They adopted the method of investing in seedling cultivation to ensure the orchard. In 1986, the income from seedling cultivation was 600,000 yuan; in 1987, the income from seedling cultivation was 2 million yuan. This money, after clearing the long-overdue debts, was all invested in developing the orchard.

	Over the years, Li Zongxiu poured all his heart into the "New Red Star." Where were his contracted fields and vegetable garden? He couldn't say. The first time he went to pick vegetables as his wife pointed, he accidentally pulled up someone else's radish. All the farm work and housework were left to his wife.

	In the autumn of 1988, when the golden wind blew, the "New Red Star" development orchard in Luohua Village was laden with fruits, shining like stars. The first batch of trees planted only two and a half years ago yielded 5,000 kilograms of fruit. The fruits were fully red, each weighing over 200 grams, with the largest exceeding 600 grams.

	In October of that year, several experts from the Chinese Academy of Sciences conducted a comprehensive inspection of the Luohua Village orchard. The inspection results showed that all indicators reached the national first-class level. On December 12, at the national "New Red Star" development conference held in Beijing, the Luohua Village orchard was listed by the Ministry of Agriculture as a key development base for the "New Red Star" and was designated as a national model orchard for the "New Red Star."

	In mid-May, we arrived at the "New Red Star" development orchard in Luohua Village. We saw that the entire mountain was densely planted with low, dwarf fruit trees. The branches, as thin as a finger, were laden with tender green apples.

	In our conversation with Li Zongxiu, we learned that this year, the orchard could yield 75,000 kilograms of apples. Currently, they are busy preparing for the export of apples. Next, they plan to focus on mechanizing the management of the orchard, striving to build this orchard into a modern apple orchard.

	The "New Red Star" has just risen here; tomorrow, it will shine with even brighter splendor.

    李宗秀和“新红星”
    朱世国
    “新红星”，这个半矮化的优良品种，30多年一直占居着苹果“皇后”的宝座。李宗秀，山东省日照县河山乡萝花一村农民，我国第一代开发“新红星”的乡村能人。
    1984年深秋的一个夜晚，李宗秀蹲在萝花一村东南岭上，默默地吸着烟。上午，在村党员大会上，李宗秀被推到了支部书记的位置上。摆在他面前的是这样的一个摊子：
    党支部一年换了两届，村干部在群众中的威信不高；土地承包到户，农用生产资料折价分配到户，只有历年积欠的7.8万元债务还占在集体的帐页上：山民们每人守着2亩3分地，艰难地劳作着……这个年近不惑之年的汉子，深感肩上担子的沉重。会议一结束，他就不由自主地来到这片山岭上。
    21年前，也是这样的一个夜晚，在这片山岭薄地上，李宗秀立下了钻研果林技术的志向。在20多年的果树技术员生涯中，这个吃地瓜干长大的庄稼汉，背着瓜干煎饼，访遍了省内各大果树研究所和试验基地，并多次前往中国科学院果树研究所及辽宁、河北等省的果树研究所学习取经，与许多著名果树专家结下了深厚的师生之谊，学习积累了丰富的果树管理技术和经验。李宗秀很早就认识到，摆脱边远落后山区的贫困面貌，发展山区林果业是一条可行的好路子。
    想到林果，李宗秀马上又想到了他的“新红星”。
    1982年秋，李宗秀在青岛农科所学习时，了解到“新红星”。他立即到泰山果树试验基地，但试验场地是不允许参观的。这难不倒李宗秀。每天天一亮，他就蹲在园外的山坡上看工人们管理果树，饿了啃口煎饼，渴了喝几口冷水。7天过去了，他感动了“上帝”。试验场破例让他进入了硕果累累的新红星试验园，并送给他两根树条，让他回去进行观察试验。当天晚上，李宗秀带着工人剪给他的两根新红星树条，兴冲冲地赶回萝花，把希望高接在老果树上。
    1984年，是农村改革大潮涌动的一年。这年冬，李宗秀先后数次组织村里人前往外地参观学习。村干部认识了“新红星”，村民也认识了“新红星”。1985年春，在村民大会上，萝花一村制定出在村东南的山岭薄地上开发新红星果园的决定。
    寒霜未尽，在萝花一村东南的山岭上，一场改造荒山的战役打响了。李宗秀带头承担了最难整的地块，并首先完成了任务。村里的汉子们上阵了，妇女老人也上阵了，还带来了从外村请来的亲戚朋友。短短一个月的时间，他们就整出了220亩标准园田。这年冬，在村东繁育了10亩果苗。1986年春，李宗秀又通过各种渠道购来1万棵“新红星”半成苗，栽种在这220亩希望的土地上。
    果园，不是一时就可以见到收益的。村民们理解，他们和支部书记一起肩起了这付重担。
    改造山岭的工钱欠着，他们没有怨言。
    管理果园的工钱也欠着，他们还是没有怨言。
    1987年，李宗秀带领村民又开发新红星200亩，全部使用自己的苗木。
    幼果园需要投入，资金问题怎么解决？他们采取了以育苗投入保果园的办法，1986年育苗收入6万元；1987年育苗收入20万元。这些钱除清还了历年陈欠外，全部投入了开发园。
    几年里，李宗秀把全部心血都倾注在“新红星”身上。家里的责任田、菜园在哪里？他说不清。第一次按妻子的指向去摘菜，竟把人家的萝卜拔了回来。全部农活和家务都压在了妻子的肩上。
    1988年金风送爽的时候，萝花一村新红星开发园硕果累累，繁星点点，第一批栽下的仅两年半树龄的果树结果5000公斤，果实全面浓红，均重200多克，最大的超过600克。
    这年10月，中科院派来数名专家，对萝花一村果园进行全面考察。考察结果，各项指数均达到全国一类水平。12月12日，在北京召开的全国“新红星”开发会议上，萝花一村果园被农业部列入新红星开发重点基点园，并被指定为全国新红星样板园。
    5月中旬，我们来到萝花一村新红星开发园。只见漫山遍野密植着低矮的果树，仅有食指粗的树枝上，结满了嫩绿的小苹果。
    在与李宗秀的交谈中我们了解到：今年，这片果园可结果7.5万公斤。目前，他们正忙于准备苹果的出口事项。下一步，他们打算在果园机械化管理上下功夫，争取把这片果园建成现代化的苹果园。
    新红星，刚刚从这里升起；明天，她会闪现出更加灿烂的光辉。
