Wan Li Meets Guyanese Delegation

Emphasizes that Counter-Revolutionary Riots Go Against the Tide and Lack Popular Support

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 1 (Reporter: Jiang Luyan) — Tonight, Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, met with a delegation from the Guyanese National Assembly led by Speaker Sassier Narine. He said that China's situation has basically returned to normal, and the Chinese government is stable.

He said that in the previous period, a counter-revolutionary riot occurred in Beijing. Its purpose was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert socialist China. This counter-revolutionary riot, which goes against the historical trend, lacks popular support and was quickly suppressed.

He said that after a long period of revolutionary struggle, the Chinese people have chosen the socialist path. In the 40 years since the founding of the country, China has achieved great success in economic construction, and the living standards of the people have improved.

However, he said, China is a large country with complex situations. Due to lack of experience, mistakes and areas of dissatisfaction have appeared in the work, such as uneven economic development, unfair distribution, lax party discipline, and the emergence of corruption. The Party and the government will summarize experiences and improve work.

He reiterated that China will continue to implement the policy of reform and opening up.

Sassier Narine said that they are very pleased to see that the situation here has returned to normal.

He said that the Chinese government can make correct judgments about domestic affairs and act in the interests of the state and the people.

Wan Li said that the relationship between China and Guyana is solid, and the friendly cooperative relationship between the two countries' parliaments, peoples, and in various fields will further develop.

After the meeting, Wan Li hosted a banquet to welcome the delegation.

Narine and his delegation are the first Guyanese parliamentary delegation to visit China since the two countries established diplomatic relations in 1972. The delegation arrived in Beijing last night at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress.

This afternoon, Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Ni Zhifu held talks with Sassier Narine in the Great Hall of the People. Both sides exchanged views on developing exchanges between the two countries' parliaments and promoting friendly cooperation between the two countries.

    强调反革命暴乱逆潮流而动不得人心
    新华社北京7月1日电　（记者姜鲁榕）全国人大常委会委员长万里今晚在这里会见由议长萨西·纳拉因率领的圭亚那国民议会代表团时说，中国的局势已基本恢复正常，中国政府是稳定的。
    他说，前一段时间，北京出现了反革命暴乱，其目的是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义中国。这种逆历史潮流而动的反革命暴乱是不得人心的，很快得到了平息。
    他说，经过长期的革命斗争，中国人民选择了社会主义道路。建国40年来，中国的经济建设取得了很大成绩，人民生活水平得到了提高。
    但是他说，中国是大国，情况复杂。由于经验不足，工作中也出现了失误和人民不满意的地方，如经济发展不平衡，分配不公，党的纪律不严，出现了腐败现象，对此，党和政府将总结经验，改进工作。
    他重申了中国将继续执行改革开放政策。
    萨西·纳拉因说，他们非常高兴地看到，这里的局势已恢复了正常。
    他说，中国政府能对国内事务作出正确的判断，并以国家和人民的利益行事。
    万里说，中圭两国关系是牢固的，两国议会、人民和两国在各个领域的友好合作关系将进一步发展。
    会见后，万里设宴欢迎代表团。
    纳拉因议长一行是中圭两国自1972年建交后来访的第一个圭亚那议会代表团。代表团应全国人大常委会邀请于昨晚抵京。
    今天下午，全国人大常委会副委员长倪志福和萨西·纳拉因议长在人民大会堂举行了会谈。双方就发展两国议会的交往和两国友好合作关系等问题交换了意见。
