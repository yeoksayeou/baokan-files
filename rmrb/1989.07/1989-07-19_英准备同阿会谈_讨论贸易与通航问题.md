Xinhua News Agency, London, 18th July

The British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 18th that the UK is prepared to hold talks with the new Argentine government on specific issues such as trade and transportation.

He said that the UK is "very interested" in Argentine President Menem's recent call for negotiations to restore diplomatic relations between the two countries. Menem stated that Argentina is willing to resume normalization talks with the UK without discussing the sovereignty of the Malvinas Islands.

The spokesman emphasized that the UK is prepared to make progress on specific issues such as finance, trade, transportation, and fishing to gradually normalize relations between the two countries.

He said: "If the Argentine government intends to gradually normalize relations between the two countries while not discussing sovereignty issues, then we welcome this."

He pointed out that it is still too early to discuss the resumption of diplomatic relations, and both sides first need to rebuild trust.

The two countries severed diplomatic relations due to the Malvinas War in 1982.

    英准备同阿会谈
    讨论贸易与通航问题
    新华社伦敦7月18日电  英国外交部发言人18日说，英国准备同阿根廷新政府就贸易和通航等具体问题举行会谈。
    他说，英国对阿根廷新总统梅内姆最近呼吁就恢复两国外交关系举行谈判“很感兴趣”。梅内姆说，阿根廷准备在不讨论马岛主权问题的条件下，恢复两国关系正常化谈判。
    这位发言人强调指出，英国准备在诸如金融、贸易、通航和捕鱼等具体问题上取得进展，以使两国关系逐步正常化。
    他说：“如果阿根廷政府打算使两国关系逐步正常化，同时不谈（马岛）主权问题，那么我们是欢迎的。”
    他指出，目前讨论复交还为时尚早，双方首先需要恢复信任。
    英阿两国因1982年爆发马岛战争而断绝了外交关系。
