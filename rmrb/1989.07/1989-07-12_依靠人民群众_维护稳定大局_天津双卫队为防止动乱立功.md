During the period of turmoil and counter-revolutionary rioting in Beijing, Tianjin, which is only about 100 kilometers away, remained relatively stable, with no incidents of beating, smashing, looting, or arson occurring throughout the city. One of the key reasons for this stability is that Tianjin has a powerful force led by the municipal Party committee and government to protect the people and Tianjin—the Double Protection Squads.

After the counter-revolutionary rioting in Beijing, a small number of individuals conspired to "open a new battlefield" in Tianjin and create chaos. Faced with this severe situation, the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee promptly issued a call for the entire city to "organize and prevent turmoil, protect the people, and protect Tianjin." Within just three days, Double Protection Squads were established in government agencies, organizations, enterprises, institutions, and districts, streets, and townships, totaling 80 teams with 250,000 members. The squad is primarily composed of Party members, League members, cadres, and veteran workers, with the main leaders of various levels of Party and government serving as political commissars and team leaders.

After the establishment of the Double Protection Squads, they actively cooperated with public security officers and armed police to conduct three city-wide searches and arrests, capturing 76 rioters who had infiltrated from Beijing and more than 300 other lawbreakers. They dismantled the illegal organizations "Tianjin Patriotic Workers' Federation" and "Tianjin Patriotic National Self-Government Association," shut down illegally set up radio stations, and assisted sanitation workers in cleaning up large and small posters and slogans. The suburban Double Protection Squads set up checkpoints at key transportation routes, strengthened inspections of passing vehicles and personnel, guarded Tianjin's gates, and prevented rioters from infiltrating. The Double Protection Squads in the three coastal areas of Tanggu, Hangang, and Dagang strengthened the protection of ports and docks and organized sea patrols to prevent rioters from escaping by boat or hijacking fishing boats. While conducting city-wide actions, the Double Protection Squads in various factories and government agencies also actively ensured the safety and security of their respective units, promptly eliminated accident hazards, prevented sabotage, and ensured the safety of key and vital departments. From June 1 to June 20 this year, the city's criminal case occurrence rate decreased by 20.3% compared to the same period last year. The market has a rich supply of goods, prices are stable and slightly decreasing, industrial and agricultural production is normal, and no major disasters have occurred.

    依靠人民群众　维护稳定大局
    天津双卫队为防止动乱立功
    本报天津7月12日电　记者梁小琴报道：在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，与北京仅距100多公里的天津却比较平稳，全市没有发生一起打、砸、抢、烧事件。一个重要原因，就是天津有一支由市委、市政府领导的保卫人民、保卫天津的强大力量——双卫队。
    北京发生反革命暴乱之后，极少数人阴谋在天津“开辟新的战场”，把天津搞乱。面对严峻的局势，天津市委及时发出号召，要求全市人民“组织起来，防止动乱，保卫人民，保卫天津”。仅3天时间，一支支双卫队就在机关、团体、企事业单位以及区、街、乡镇相继建立，共有80个支队，25万队员，以党团员、干部和老工人为主体，由各级党政主要负责人担任政委和队长。
    双卫队成立后，积极配合公安干警、武警部队进行了3次全市性的清查和缉捕，捕获76名从北京窜来的暴乱分子和300多名各类违法犯罪分子，摧毁了非法组织“天津爱国工人联合会”和“天津爱国民族自治会”，取缔了非法设置的广播站，并协助环卫工人洗刷了大小字报和标语。郊县的双卫队在交通要道设卡，加强对过往车辆和人员的检查，把好天津大门，严防暴乱分子窜入。塘沽、汉沽、大港3个滨海区的双卫队加强对港口码头的保卫，并组织了海上巡逻队，防止暴乱分子搭乘或劫持渔船外逃。在全市集中行动的同时，各工厂、机关的双卫队，还积极搞好本单位内部的安全保卫工作，及时消除事故隐患，防止破坏事件发生，确保重点要害部门的安全。今年6月1日至20日，全市刑事案件发案率比去年同期下降20.3％，市场商品丰富、物价稳中有降，全市工农业生产正常，没有发生重大灾害性事故。
