A bird caused a Soviet "Mig" 29 fighter jet to crash during an international air show in France in early June. The cause of the accident has been identified: the fighter jet collided with a bird, damaging the right engine blades and leading to the crash.

This conclusion was reached by the Soviet-French joint investigation committee on June 27 in Moscow. Today's "Socialist Industry News" provided a detailed report on the investigation results.
