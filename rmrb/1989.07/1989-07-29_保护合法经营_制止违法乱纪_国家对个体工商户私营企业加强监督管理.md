Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 29th.

To protect legal operations, stop illegal activities, and promote the healthy development of individual and private enterprises, the state will soon conduct a cleanup and inspection of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises.

Gan Guoping, deputy director of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said at a press conference today that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy has led to rapid development of individual industrial and commercial activities and private enterprises. By 1988, the number of people engaged in these sectors reached over 23 million, with more than 40,000 private enterprises. They have played an active role in promoting production, activating circulation, revitalizing the economy, facilitating people's lives, expanding employment, and increasing state revenue, becoming an important force in China's economic life. Most individual industrial and commercial households and private entrepreneurs are law-abiding, but some lack professional ethics and engage in illegal operations. Therefore, local industry and commerce administrative departments will work with relevant departments to conduct a comprehensive cleanup and inspection of individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises.

The deputy director said that the inspection and handling of illegal operations will mainly include the following: (1) those engaging in illegal operations of important production materials and scarce durable consumer goods; (2) those manufacturing and selling counterfeit and harmful goods, damaging consumer interests; (3) those engaging in forced sales, monopolistic practices, and price gouging; (4) those involved in smuggling and private trading; (5) those printing and selling reactionary, obscene publications, images, and audio-visual products; (6) those profiting from illegal activities such as prostitution and gambling; (7) those exceeding their scope of business and changing their business methods without authorization; (8) those engaging in adulteration, shoddy work, and causing serious consequences. Problems discovered during the cleanup and inspection will be handled according to the law, including criticism and education, fines, confiscation of property, suspension of business, and revocation of licenses. Those who violate criminal laws will be handed over to judicial authorities for punishment.

Gan Guoping emphasized that during the cleanup and inspection, it is necessary to distinguish the nature of ownership and strictly follow the regulations to separate individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises that are disguised as collective enterprises, and register them according to their true situation. Unlicensed operations will be cleaned up and inspected, and different situations will be handled differently. For those in employment engaging in unlicensed operations, strict measures will be taken to stop them; for those unemployed engaging in unlicensed operations, some will be stopped after inspection, and some can be issued licenses. Farmers selling agricultural and sideline products in the city should enter the market.

Gan Guoping also pointed out that the industry and commerce departments should actively cooperate with the tax authorities to do a good job in tax collection and management for individual industrial and commercial households and private enterprises, educate individual industrial and commercial operators and private entrepreneurs to pay taxes according to the law, and stop tax evasion, tax avoidance, and tax resistance.

    保护合法经营  制止违法乱纪
    国家对个体工商户私营企业加强监督管理
    新华社北京7月29日电　（实习生徐伟）为保护合法经营，制止违法经营，促进个体工商业和私营经济的健康发展，国家将于近期对个体工商户和私营企业进行清理检查。
    国家工商行政管理局甘国屏副局长在今天的新闻发布会上说，党的十一届三中全会以来，由于贯彻改革开放的方针，个体工商业和私营企业有较快发展，1988年从业人员达2300多万人，私营企业达4万多户。他们在促进生产、活跃流通、繁荣经济、方便人民生活、扩大劳动就业、增加国家收入等方面发挥了积极的作用，已经成为我国经济生活中一支重要的力量。在广大个体工商户和私营者当中，大多数人是守法经营的，但一部分人缺乏职业道德，从事违法经营活动。为此，各地工商行政管理机关将会同有关部门对个体工商户和私营企业进行一次全面的清理和检查。
    这位副局长说，检查处理违法经营活动的内容主要包括：（1）非法经营重要生产资料和紧俏耐用消费品的；（2）制造、销售假冒商品和有毒有害物品损害消费者利益的；（3）强买强卖、欺行霸市、哄抬物价的；（4）走私贩私的；
  （5）印制、销售反动、淫秽书刊、图片、音像制品的；（6）利用卖淫、赌博等非法手段牟利的；（7）擅自超越经营范围和改变经营方式的；（8）掺杂使假、偷工减料造成严重后果的。对清理检查中发现的问题，将根据情节依法进行处理，包括批评教育、罚款、没收财物、停业整顿、吊销执照等，触犯刑律的送交司法机关惩办。
    甘国屏强调，在清理检查中，必须划清所有制性质，严格按照规定把挂着集体企业招牌的个体工商户、私营企业划分出来，按其真实情况进行登记注册；对无证经营进行清理检查，区别不同情况处理。对在职人员从事无证经营的要严格取缔；待业人员从事无证经营的，经清查有的应当取缔，有的可以发照。农民进城出售农副产品，应当进入集贸市场。
    甘国屏还指出，工商部门应积极配合税务部门做好对个体工商户和私营企业的税收征管工作，教育个体工商业者和私营企业者依法纳税，制止偷税、漏税、抗税的行为。
