Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 2nd.

The fifth leg of the International Amateur Athletics Federation Grand Prix was held in Oslo, Norway, on July 1st, with athletes from various countries setting seven best marks of the year.

Former world record holder, American Carl Lewis, finished second with a time of 10.11 seconds, while his compatriot, Leroy Burrell, won the gold with 10.05 seconds.

Norwegian long-distance runner Ingrid Kristiansen set the best mark of the year in the women's 10,000 meters with a time of 30:48.51. Kristiansen currently holds the world records for both the 10,000 meters and 5,000 meters, but her performance this time was far from her personal best.

Kenyan athlete Yobes Ondieki, aged 28, set the world's best mark of the year in the men's 5,000 meters with a time of 13:04.24. Ethiopian long-distance runner, Paul Tergat, won the 3,000 meters with a time of 7:34.79, setting the best mark of the year, but this was still 2.23 seconds slower than Kenya's Moses Kiptanui's world record set in 1987.

American Johnny Gray, who failed to win a medal in the 1988 Olympics, won the men's 800 meters with a time of 1:43.39, setting the best mark of the year.

Kenyan athlete Julius Kariuki, the gold medalist in the 3,000-meter steeplechase at the 1988 Olympics, won the event with a time of 8:14.39, setting the best mark of the year.

Other athletes who set the best marks of the year include Soviet pole vaulter Sergey Bubka, who cleared 5.90 meters, and East German shot putter Ulf Timmermann, who threw 21.93 meters to win the gold.
