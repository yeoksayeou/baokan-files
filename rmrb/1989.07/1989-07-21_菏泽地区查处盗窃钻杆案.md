Edition: 6

On February 4, your newspaper's fifth edition published a reader's letter titled "Drill Pipes Turned into Anti-Shock Beds, Heze Abounds with Resale Points." Following this, we instructed the regional Bureau of Industry and Commerce to organize the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in Heze, Juancun, and Dongming counties and cities to conduct an investigation. The investigation revealed that there are currently 39 anti-shock bed processing points in the three counties and cities. The drill pipes used to make these anti-shock beds all originate from the Zhongyuan Oilfield, but these processing points do not have purchase receipts. In response, we have taken the following measures:

1. The Zhongyuan Oilfield will issue certificates and receipts for the sale of discarded drill pipes. Meanwhile, relevant departments in our region will regularly inspect anti-shock bed processing points. Those without purchase certificates and receipts will be sealed off, dealt with, and ultimately closed down.

2. Strengthen the management of second-hand markets, and seriously handle those who engage in the illegal buying and selling of drill pipes without proper procedures.

3. Require the Bureau of Industry and Commerce in each county and city to take measures to stop the illegal trading of drill pipes and seriously investigate and deal with those who misuse and damage state property.

    菏泽地区查处盗窃钻杆案
    2月4日你报第五版刊登《钻杆做成防震床，菏泽遍布销赃点》的读者来信后，我们责成地区工商局组织菏泽、鄄城、东明3县、市工商局作了查处。据查，三县、市现有防震床加工点39处。他们制作防震床的钻杆，都是出自中原油田，而加工点都没有购货发票。为此，我们采取了如下措施。
    一、中原油田对废旧钻杆的销售一律出具证明和单据；同时我区有关单位定期检查防震床加工点，对没有购料证明和单据的加工点一律封存、处理，直至关闭。
    二、加强对废旧市场的管理，对没有正式手续从事购销钻杆的不法分子严肃处理。
    三、要求各县、市工商局采取措施，制止钻杆的非法交易，认真查处动用和破坏国家财产的不法分子。
