**The "Cocaine Queen" of Colombia is Assassinated**

Bogota – Colombia's notorious "Cocaine Queen," Veronica Rivera, was assassinated on the night of June 30.

According to local police, the 45-year-old Rivera was shot and killed by two motorcyclists in the northwestern suburbs of the capital, Bogota. Police who arrived at the scene exchanged fire with the assailants, killing one and allowing the other to escape.

Police said Rivera had once been a street vendor and had become a key figure in Bogota's cocaine trafficking network in the late 1970s. She owned several drug processing facilities and was not only the head of the cocaine trafficking network but also a leader of an organized crime syndicate. She had been involved in numerous criminal activities. In 1983, she was arrested by the police but was released soon after. Despite being wanted by the police, her whereabouts remained unknown.

    哥“可卡因皇后”被杀
    新华社北京7月2日电　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚全国臭名远扬的“可卡因皇后”贝罗尼卡·里韦拉6月30日晚被人暗杀。
    据当地警方报道，现年45岁的里韦拉是在首都波哥大城西北郊遭到2名摩托车骑手枪击后身亡的。闻讯而至的警察在与杀手交火时，击毙其中一名，另外一名逃走。
    警方说，里韦拉早年曾当过街头小贩，70年代后期变成了波哥大可卡因贩毒网的首要人物，拥有若干个毒品加工基地。她不但是可卡因贩毒网的头子，而且也是有组织的犯罪集团的头目，曾涉嫌多次刑事犯罪活动。1983年她被警方抓获，但不久就被释放。此后，虽然警方四处通缉，但始终未能发现其下落。
