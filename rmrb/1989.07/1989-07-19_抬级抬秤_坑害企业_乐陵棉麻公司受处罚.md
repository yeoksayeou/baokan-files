The illegal price behavior of Leling City Cotton and Hemp Company in the cotton allocation was recently investigated and punished by the State Price Bureau. The company and its three affiliated cottonseed oil processing plants were fined 115.5 million yuan for illegal gains and an additional 116 million yuan in penalties.

From November to December last year, Leling City Cotton and Hemp Company sent 12 batches of cotton to three cotton mills in Yantai City, all of which involved illegal acts of inflating grades and lengths. The company's First Cottonseed Oil Processing Plant sent 8 batches of cotton to a certain cotton mill in Yantai City, totaling 7,976 piculs. Originally verified as first-grade cotton, upon re-inspection by the relevant technical supervision departments, 5 batches were found to be fifth-grade cotton, and 3 batches were sixth-grade cotton. Additionally, the weight was short by 610 piculs, resulting in an overcharge of more than 760,000 yuan.

The illegal acts of inflating grades and weights by Leling City Cotton and Hemp Company led to increased costs and reduced profits for the three cotton mills, even resulting in losses. The product quality was low and unstable, causing great distress to the factories. In March, the State Price Bureau and the State Technical Supervision Bureau formed a joint investigation team to handle this case over two months. The decision was made to return the illegally overcharged amount to the cotton-using units and to order the company to conduct a self-inspection of the quality standards and price policies of other batches of cotton sent out. Any violations of regulations must be immediately corrected.

    抬级抬秤　坑害企业
    乐陵棉麻公司受处罚
    本报讯　山东省乐陵市棉麻公司在棉花调拨中价格违法行为日前被国家物价局查处，没收棉麻公司及下属3个油棉加工厂非法所得115.5万元，并罚款116万元。
    乐陵市棉麻公司去年11月至12月间，调往烟台市3家棉纺厂12批棉花均有抬高品级、长度等违法行为。这个公司所属第一油棉加工厂调往烟台市某棉纺厂的8批棉花，共计7976担，原验为一级棉，经有关技术监督部门复验，其中5批为5级棉，3批为6级棉，而且亏重610担，共多收货款76万多元。
    乐陵市棉麻公司抬级抬秤行为，导致3家棉纺厂成本上升，利润减少，甚至亏损，产品质量低而不稳，工厂苦不堪言。今年3月，国家物价局和国家技术监督局组成联合调查组，对此进行了历时两个月的查处，决定将没收的非法多收货款归还用棉单位，并令该公司对调出的其它批次棉花质量标准和价格政策执行情况进行自查，违反规定的要立即纠正。
