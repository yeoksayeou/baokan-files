Every time we open the "Directory of Generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" and see the familiar faces of so many old comrades, we are reminded of our old leader and comrade from the 115th Division, Comrade Chen Guang. This year marks the 35th anniversary of Comrade Chen Guang's unfortunate passing. We deeply miss him and feel a responsibility to introduce the life achievements of this senior general who made significant contributions to the Chinese revolution to the people.

Chen Guang was born in 1906 in a poor peasant family in Yizhang, Hunan. His father worked as a laborer for a landlord for over forty years, and his mother sold milk for six years to make ends meet. Out of twelve children, only two survived. Chen Guang attended private school for only three years and started working in agriculture at the age of fourteen.

During the Great Revolution of 1926, Chen Guang joined the Farmers' Association and served as a committee member and commander of the Red Guards. In May 1927, after the "May 30th Incident," Chen Guang was pursued by reactionary forces and was forced to flee. That winter, amidst the bloody white terror, Chen Guang joined the Communist Party of China. In early 1928, the troops led by Zhu De and Chen Yi, which had survived the Nanchang Uprising, entered Chen Guang's hometown, mobilized the peasants, and prepared for an uprising. Following the party's instructions, Chen Guang retrieved twelve guns hidden during the Great Revolution and participated in the Hunan Uprising. Later, he followed Zhu De and Chen Yi to Jinggangshan. During the Second Revolutionary Civil War, Chen Guang served in various positions, including platoon leader, company commander, regiment commander, division chief of staff, division commander, and acting commander of the First Army Corps. In the frequent battles to establish the Jinggangshan base and counter the encirclement and suppression, he firmly executed orders, led from the front, and displayed wisdom and bravery, earning numerous merits. In the October 1929 battle of Meixian, he led a regiment to tenaciously resist the enemy's repeated attacks by four regiments, covering the main force of the Fourth Red Army's safe retreat. In the February 1930 battles of Shuinan and Zhuxia, he risked his life to save Lin Biao. In these intense battles, Chen Guang was wounded ten times and was twice commended by the Fourth Red Army. At the First National Congress of the Chinese Soviet Republic in November 1931, he was awarded the Second Class Red Star Medal. Chen Guang, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong's military thought of people's war, transformed from an ordinary peasant into a revolutionary, joined the Red Army, and gradually grew into an outstanding Red Army senior commander through the frequent battles of the Chinese revolutionary armed struggle.

During the famous Long March, Chen Guang shone with his brightest light, brilliantly completing a series of major combat missions crucial to the revolution. In the early stages of the Long March in October 1934, during the fierce battle to break through the fourth line of blockade by the Nationalist Party at the Xiang River, Chen Guang, as the commander of the Second Division, did not disappoint the expectations of the Central Military Commission and firmly completed the mission of blocking the enemy, covering the Central Military Commission's crossing of the Xiang River. On December 30, the Second Division, with its fierce fighting spirit, quickly reached the Wu River and was the first to break through the Wu River barrier, ensuring the safe crossing of the Central Military Commission's troops. Later, the Sixth Regiment of the Second Division cleverly captured Zunyi, the Fourth Regiment captured Luoshan Pass, opened the city of Tongzi, and occupied Niulang Pass; in Xinzhou, they annihilated two enemy regiments, captured Songkan, and disrupted the enemy's pursuit and blockade plans. Subsequently, the Second Division guarded the northwest direction and, together with other units, ensured the successful convening of the Zunyi Conference. After the Zunyi Conference, in the Four Crossings of the Red Army, which Mao Zedong called his "masterpiece," the Second Division brilliantly executed the military commission's strategy of large-scale mobile warfare, feigned an attack on Guiyang, drew out the Yunnan Army, threatened Kunming, and enabled our army to cleverly cross the Jinsha River, breaking free from the encirclement and pursuit of tens of thousands of enemy troops. In late May, the vanguard of the Red Army arrived at the banks of the Dadu River. This area was once the battlefield where the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's Prince Yi, Shi Dakai, met his tragic end. The 17 brave soldiers of the First Regiment of the First Division successfully crossed the Dadu River at Anshun. Later, the Second Division was ordered to raid Luding. On May 29, the Second Division marched 240 miles day and night, fought three battles along the way, broke through three enemy lines, and arrived at Luding on time. At dusk, they launched a fierce assault. The 22 brave soldiers of the Second Company of the Fourth Regiment bravely climbed the iron chain under enemy fire and surging waves, advancing through fire and water, and fought a thrilling and heroic battle in the history of warfare, finally capturing the Luding Bridge and shattering Chiang Kai-shek's plan to make the Red Army repeat Shi Dakai's fate. In June, Chen Guang led the Second Division as the vanguard to cross the rarely trodden Jiajin Mountain and successfully met with the Fourth Front Army. In August, the units led by the Second Division successfully crossed the vast, uninhabited grasslands. On September 16, the Red Army arrived at the final barrier of the Long March, Lazi Pass. At the critical moment when the Fourth Regiment of the Second Division failed to capture the pass after a whole day of frontal assault, Chen Guang personally led part of the troops to climb the cliff at night, suddenly appearing behind the enemy like gods from the sky, and cooperated with the Fourth Regiment to capture Lazi Pass, ensuring the Red Army's final crossing of the dangerous terrain. Chen Guang, this loyal son of the people, from the bloody battle of the Xiang River to breaking through the dangerous Lazi Pass, did not disappoint the trust of the Central Military Commission and the army corps leaders. He led the Second Division, breaking through obstacles and capturing passes, successfully completing every mission given by the party, making an indelible contribution to the Chinese revolutionary cause. Chen Guang's loyalty to the revolutionary cause, the party, and the people, his fearlessness and self-sacrifice, his heroic spirit of daring to overcome all enemies, and his daring and fearless spirit won the respect and trust of the broad masses of soldiers and officers.

In August 1937, the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army was reorganized into the Eighth Route Army, and Chen Guang was appointed commander of the 343rd Brigade of the 115th Division. Xiao Hua was appointed political commissar. On September 25, under the command of Lin Biao and Nie Rongzhen, he led the 685th and 686th Regiments to undertake the main combat tasks in the Battle of Pingxing Pass, bravely fighting the enemy and annihilating the elite Hokushin Division of the Japanese invaders, achieving the first major victory of annihilation in the national war of resistance, striking the arrogant attitude of the Japanese invaders, and boosting the confidence of the Chinese people in defeating Japanese fascism. On November 4, Chen Guang again led his troops to participate in the Guangyang Ambush Battle, annihilating nearly a thousand Japanese troops. In early March 1938, after Lin Biao was injured by friendly fire and left the troops, the Central Military Commission appointed Chen Guang as the acting commander of the 115th Division. In September of the same year, he and Luo Ronghuan together commanded the troops to achieve three consecutive victories in the Fenli Highway battles.

In late 1938, Chen Guang and Luo Ronghuan were ordered to lead the main force of the 115th Division from western Shanxi, crossing the Tongpu and Pinghan railways, and advancing into the enemy-occupied areas of Shandong. On March 3, 1939, they won their first battle at Fanba, annihilating more than 800 enemy troops and, in cooperation with local party organizations, opening up the situation for our army to establish a base in western Shandong. The advance of the 115th Division into Shandong caused great panic among the Japanese invaders. In May, the Japanese army mobilized heavy troops and a large number of vehicles and artillery from Jinan, Taian, Feicheng, and Wenshang, dividing into nine routes to encircle and "sweep" the Taixi region, attempting to annihilate the main force of our 115th Division in one go. At that time, our army had more than 3,000 people, including a part of the combat troops and the headquarters of the 115th Division, the Communist Party of China's West Shandong Area Committee, and other party and government personnel. On May 11, they were surrounded by the Japanese army in the area of Luofang, southeast of Feicheng. Luo Ronghuan was not at the division headquarters as he was inspecting the East Wenshang Detachment. The responsibility of breaking out fell entirely on Chen Guang. Facing this severe test, Chen Guang analyzed the enemy situation and immediately decided to defend the division headquarters in the mountainous area around Luofang, utilizing our army's strength in mountain warfare, controlling the high points west of Luofang, including Feizhu Mountain, Jian Mountain, and Fenghuang Mountain. He ordered the 686th Regiment to defend the position at all costs. The soldiers of the 686th Regiment and the Jinpu Detachment bravely repelled the enemy's repeated attacks. During the intense battle, Chen Guang personally commanded the frontline trenches and continued until dusk. After nightfall, Chen Guang ordered a nighttime breakout, jumping out of the encirclement through the gaps in the enemy lines and safely reaching the southeastern region of Dongping. In the Battle of Luofang, although our army suffered more than 300 casualties, it killed and wounded nearly a thousand Japanese troops, including a major general and his regiment. After the breakout from Luofang, Luo Ronghuan returned to the division headquarters and convened a cadre meeting, praising the brave and tenacious fighting spirit of all soldiers and officers, highly evaluating the victory of the breakout from Luofang, and preserving a large number of outstanding cadres since the establishment of the Red Army, which was of great significance for developing revolutionary forces and continuing the war of resistance in the enemy-occupied areas. Chen Guang also spoke at the meeting. After the meeting, he designated Zhang Renchang, the commander of the regiment, and the leaders of the special committee to go to the Luofang area to take care of the wounded and sick.

Soon after the Battle of Luofang, Chen Guang and Luo Ronghuan commanded the Battle of Liangshan, which the Eighth Route Army headquarters called a "model of annihilation," completely annihilating a Japanese battalion of more than 300 people, capturing 13 officers and soldiers, seizing two field guns, and killing the Japanese lieutenant colonel Longtian Jian. This heavily struck the morale of the Japanese invaders. The relevant Japanese departments even specially compiled a booklet titled "Study of Chen Guang's Operations" and distributed it to their troops for reference. In 1940, Chen Guang commanded the battles of Baiyan and Tianbaoshan in southern Shandong, annihilating the local bandits and traitors who colluded with the enemy, connecting the central and southern regions of Shandong. In March 1941, Chen Guang personally led his troops to attack the enemy stronghold of Qingkou in the coastal area, eliminating more than ten enemy strongholds around it, further expanding our base. In December 1942, Chen Guang personally commanded the Battle of Jiazi Mountain. In January 1943, Chen Guang led the Second Teaching Brigade to attack the Japanese stronghold of Tancheng, completely annihilating the defending enemy and, taking advantage of the victory, eliminating 18 enemy strongholds around Tancheng. From 1938 to the spring of 1943, in the first five years of the War of Resistance, Chen Guang, under the party's cultivation and the tempering of the war environment, gained relatively comprehensive and rich combat experience, displaying his outstanding command talents and making significant contributions to the opening up and establishment of the Shandong anti-Japanese base.

In the spring of 1943, Chen Guang was ordered to go to Yan'an and attended the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China. After Japan's surrender, he was ordered to return to Shandong with Lin Biao but received a central order to go to Northeast China and participate in the creation of the Northeast base. In Northeast China, during the War of Liberation, Chen Guang successively served as the deputy commander of the East Manchuria Military Region, the deputy commander of the Liaoning-Jilin Military Region, the commander of the Sixth Column, the commander of the Songjiang Military Region, and the commander of the garrison of Harbin City, making due contributions to the opening up of the Northeast base and the victory of the Northeast battlefield. In April 1946, after the Soviet Red Army withdrew from Changchun, Chen Guang led the troops of the Liaoning-Jilin Military Region to quickly approach Changchun and immediately launched an attack on the "Iron and Stone Army" (elite troops of the puppet Manchukuo) inside the city. After three days of fierce fighting, they annihilated more than 20,000 defending enemies, liberating Changchun for the first time and achieving an important victory in the Battle of Siping. In May, after our army withdrew from Changchun and Jilin, the 88th Division of the Nationalist Party, with an enhanced regiment, followed to the Xinzhou-Lafa line and continued to invade the liberated areas. To stop the enemy's attack and connect our army in North Manchuria and East Manchuria, Chen Guang actually commanded the original Shandong troops, the First and Second Divisions, to annihilate the defending enemies of five battalions using night and close combat.

In the spring of 1949, the Fourth Field Army marched south, and Chen Guang was appointed deputy chief of staff of the Fourth Field Army. Soon after, he was appointed deputy commander of the Guangdong Military Region and commander of the Guangzhou Garrison. Chen Guang, from a poor peasant, grew into a senior general of our army, experiencing all stages of the Chinese revolution. He dedicated his entire life to the great cause of communism and the liberation of the Chinese people. He was loyal and fearless for the party and the people, dedicating his talents and blood in the arduous years of war. As a senior cadre, he always maintained the glorious tradition of hard work and simplicity, keeping the original nature of the working people. He also diligently studied Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the party's policies. He paid great attention to conducting investigations and research in practice. He was upright and unyielding. No one is perfect, and gold is not pure. Chen Guang also had his shortcomings and mistakes, which belonged to internal contradictions among the people but were subjected to unjust accusations and attacks, leading to Chen Guang's wrongful death in June 1954.

In 1987, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the Organization Department, the General Political Department, and the Military Commission's Discipline Inspection Commission jointly investigated the case of Chen Guang and reported to the Central Committee. In April 1988, with the approval of the Central Committee, Chen Guang's reputation was restored, the original conclusion of him being "anti-party" was revoked, and Chen Guang's party membership was officially restored. More than 30 years have passed, and his name is rarely known to the younger generation. His achievements are also rarely mentioned in the reminiscences after the founding of the nation, but history is fair, and the party's policies are just. In the glorious chapters of our army's past wars, people will not forget this loyal old warrior who made important contributions to the Chinese revolutionary war, and we will not forget this outstanding general of our army. We will always remember him.

    历史不会忘记
    ——怀念陈光同志
    陈沂  苏静　林月琴　王宗槐
    每当我们翻开《中国人民解放军将帅名录》看到那么多老战友的熟悉面孔时，就会想起我们一一五师的老领导，老战友陈光同志。今年是陈光同志不幸去世35周年，我们深切地怀念他，同时感到有责任将这位对中国革命作出重要贡献的高级将领一生的业绩介绍给人们。
    1906年陈光出生在湖南宜章的一个贫苦农民家里，父亲给地主当长工四十余年，母亲迫于生计卖奶六年，所生养的十二个子女只活下两个。陈光童年只读过三年私塾，十四岁起就从事繁重的农业劳动。
    1926年的大革命中，陈光参加了农民协会，任农会委员，赤卫队长。1927年5月“马日事变”后，陈光同志遭反动派通缉，被迫逃亡。这年冬天，在血雨腥风的白色恐怖中，陈光加入了中国共产党。1928年初朱德陈毅同志率领的南昌起义保存下来的队伍，开进陈光家乡，发动农民，准备暴动。陈光遵照党的指示，挖出大革命中藏的十二条枪，参加了湘南暴动。此后，随朱德、陈毅上了井冈山。在第二次国内革命战争时期，陈光先后担任过排长、连长、支队长、师参谋长、师长、代理一军团军团长等职务。在创建井冈山根据地和反围剿的频繁战斗中，他坚决执行命令，身先士卒，机智勇敢，屡建功勋。1929年10月梅县战斗中，他率领一个营顽强阻击敌人四个团的轮番进攻，掩护红四军主力安全撤退。1930年2月在水南、值夏战役中，他冒着牺牲自己的危险，救过林彪的性命。在这些激烈的战斗中，陈光同志光荣负伤达十次之多，他的英雄事迹曾两次受到红四军传令嘉奖。在1931年11月召开的第一届中华苏维埃代表大会上，他被授予二级红星奖章。陈光同志在枪林弹雨的战场上，在同敌人生死搏斗中，在中国革命武装斗争的频繁战斗中，在毛泽东人民战争军事思想的哺育下，从一个普通农民走向革命，参加红军，逐步锻炼成长，成为优秀的红军高级指挥员。
    在举世闻名的二万五千里长征中，陈光迸发出他生命中最灿烂的火花，出色地完成了党给予的一系列关系革命成败的重大作战任务。1934年10月长征初期，在突破国民党第四道封锁线湘江的激战中，担任红二师师长的陈光，没有辜负中央军委的期望，坚决完成了阻击任务，掩护中央军委纵队渡过湘江。12月30日，二师发扬猛打猛追的作风，神速进抵乌江，并在江界首先突破乌江天险，又一次保证军委纵队顺利过江。此后，二师六团智取遵义，四团攻占娄山关，打开桐梓城，占领牛栏关；在新站击溃敌两个团占领松坎，打乱敌人追剿堵击的部署。随后二师向西北方向警戒，与兄弟部队一道保证了遵义会议的胜利召开。遵义会议后，在被毛泽东同志称为“得意之笔”的四渡赤水战役中，红二师出色地执行军委大踏步机动作战的方针，佯攻贵阳，调出滇军，威逼昆明，使我军得以巧渡金沙江，跳出几十万敌军的围追堵截，重重包围。5月下旬，红军先头部队来到大渡河畔。这一带曾是太平天国翼王石达开当年为全军覆没而抱恨终天的古战场。红一师一团十七勇士在安顺场强渡大渡河成功。之后，二师又受命奔袭泸定，5月29日，二师昼夜兼程二百四十里，沿途打了三仗，打垮敌军三道防线，按预定时间到达泸定，于黄昏前发起强攻，四团二连的22个勇士冒着敌人炮火的熊熊烈焰和涛天恶浪勇攀铁索，蹈火前进，进行了中外战争史上一场惊心动魄的壮烈战斗，终于取得了强夺泸定桥的胜利，彻底粉碎了蒋介石让红军重蹈石达开覆辙的命运。6月陈光率二师为先导部队翻越人迹罕见的夹金山，与四方面军胜利会师。8月以二师为前卫的部队又胜利穿越了渺无人烟的茫茫草地。9月16日红军来到长征途中的最后一道天险腊子口。在二师四团正面强攻一整天未能攻下的紧要关头，陈光亲率部分战士半夜里自绝壁攀岩而上，突然出现在敌后，有如神兵天将，配合正面四团夺取了腊子口，保证红军最后渡过险境。陈光这位人民忠贞的儿子，自血战湘江到突破天险腊子口，他没有辜负中央军委及军团领导的重托，率领着红二师，一路披荆斩棘，抢关夺隘，胜利地完成了党交给他的每个任务，对中国革命事业作出了不可磨灭的贡献。陈光在长征中表现出的对革命事业对党和人民的赤胆忠心，奋不顾身，勇于牺牲的大无畏精神，敢于压倒一切敌人的革命英雄主义气概，赢得了广大指战员的钦敬与信任。
    1937年8月中国工农红军改编为八路军，陈光任115师343旅旅长，肖华同志任政委。9月25日在平型关战役中，在林彪、聂荣臻的指挥下，他率685、686两团担负主要作战任务，奋勇杀敌，歼灭了日寇精锐板垣师团一个后尾联队，取得了全国抗战以来第一个歼灭战的重大胜利，打击了日本侵略军的嚣张气焰，鼓舞了中国军民战胜日本法西斯的信心。11月4日，陈光同志又率部参加了广阳伏击战歼灭日军近千人。1938年3月初林彪被友军误伤离开部队后，中央军委任命陈光同志为115师代理师长。同年9月，他又和罗荣桓同志一起指挥部队作战，取得了汾离公路三战三捷的胜利。
    1938年底陈光罗荣桓奉命率115师主力由晋西出发，跨越同蒲、平汉铁路，挺进山东敌后。1939年3月3日，首战樊坝消灭伪军800余人，配合地方党打开了我军在鲁西建立根据地的局面。115师挺进山东引起了日本侵略者的极大恐慌。5月，日军从济南、泰安、肥城、汶上等地调集重兵及大量汽车、火炮，分九路合围“扫荡”泰西地区，妄图一举歼灭我115师主力。当时我军有3000余人，除了一部分战斗部队外，还有师直机关，中共鲁西区党委等党政机关人员，5月11日被日军包围于肥城东南陆房一带。罗荣桓同志因去泰西东汶支队视察不在师部，突围的重担全部落在陈光肩上。在这严峻的考验面前，陈光分析了敌情后，当即决定师部依托陆房周围山地发挥我军山地作战的特长，控制陆房以西肥猪山、岈山及凤凰山等制高点，命令686团不惜一切代价，坚守阵地。我686团及津浦支队的指战员们打退敌人一次又一次的冲锋，战斗激烈时陈光亲临前沿阵地指挥，一直坚持到黄昏。夜幕降临后，陈光下令连夜突围，从敌人间隙中跳出了包围圈，安全到达东平东南地区。我军在陆房战斗中虽伤亡300余人，但毙伤日军大佐联队长以下近千人。陆房突围后罗荣桓同志回到师部召开了干部会议，表扬了全体指战员英勇顽强的战斗精神，高度评价了陆房突围的胜利，保存了红军建军以来的一大批优秀骨干，对发展革命力量坚持敌后抗日战争，具有重大意义。陈光也在会上讲了话，会后他还指定了张仁初团长和特委领导同志去陆房一带安置伤病人员。
    陆房战斗后不久，陈光罗荣桓又指挥了被八路军总部称之为“歼灭战的典范”的梁山战斗，全歼日军一个大队300余人，俘虏了13名官兵，缴获了两门野炮，击毙日本长田敏江少佐，沉重打击了日本侵略军的气焰。为此，日军有关部门专门撰写了“陈光部作战研究”的小册子发至部队，供其作战使用。1940年陈光在鲁南指挥了白彦、天宝山等战斗，消灭了勾结敌伪的土顽分子和叛匪，使鲁中鲁南联成一片。1941年3月陈光曾亲自率部攻入滨海区青口敌人据点，拔掉周围敌伪据点10余处，进一步扩大了我根据地。1942年12月，陈光又亲临前线指挥甲子山战斗，1943年1月，陈光率教二旅，攻打日寇据点郯城，一举攻克郯城全歼守敌，并乘胜拔除郯城周围敌伪据点18处之多。自1938年至1943年春在抗日战争的头5年多时间里，陈光同志在党的培养和战争环境的锻炼中，取得了比较全面而丰富的战斗经验，发挥了他杰出的指挥才能，对开辟和建立山东抗日根据地作出了重大贡献。
    1943年春陈光奉调赴延安，出席了党的第七次代表大会。日本投降后，他奉命随林彪回山东工作，途中又接到中央命令转赴东北，参加东北根据地的创建工作。在东北，解放战争时期，陈光先后担任东满军区副司令员，辽吉军区副司令员，第六纵队司令员，松江军区司令员兼哈尔滨市卫戍司令员，为开辟东北根据地和夺取东北战场的胜利做出了应有的贡献。1946年4月，苏联红军撤离长春，陈光率领辽吉军区部队迅速抵近长春，即日向城内伪满“铁石部队”（伪满精锐部队）发起攻击，经过3天的激烈战斗，全歼守敌2万余人，第一次解放了长春，取得了四平会战中的一个重要胜利。5月，我军从长春、吉林撤退后，国民党88师一个加强团跟进到新站拉法一线，继续对解放区进犯。为了阻止敌人的进攻。沟通我军北满与东满的联系，陈光实际指挥原山东部队1师2师用夜战和近战全歼守敌5个营。
    1949年春第四野战军南下，陈光被任命为四野副参谋长，不久又被任命为广东军区副司令员兼广州市警备司令员，陈光同志从一个贫苦农民成长为我军的一位高级将领，经历了中国革命战斗的各个历史阶段，他把自己的全部生命都奉献给伟大的共产主义事业和中国人民解放事业。他对党和人民忠心耿耿奋不顾身，在艰苦的战争年代他奉献了自己才能和鲜血，他身为高级干部，始终保持了艰苦朴素的光荣传统，联系群众的劳动人民本色。他还十分勤奋地学习马列主义理论、毛泽东思想和党的方针政策。他十分重视深入实际进行调查研究。他秉性耿直，刚正不阿。人无完人，金无足赤，陈光同志也有他的缺点、失误，陈光的缺点、失误属于人民内部矛盾，却遭到不应有的诬陷和打击，致使陈光同志1954年6月含冤逝世。
    1987年，中纪委、中组部、总政治部和军委纪委曾联合调查陈光同志案情后呈报中央，1988年4月经中央批准，恢复了陈光同志的名誉。撤销原定他“反党”的结论，正式恢复了陈光同志的党籍。时间已过去了30多年，他的名字现在的年轻的人很少知道，他的业绩在建国后的回忆文章中也绝少提及，但历史是公正的，党的政策是公允的，在我军过去的战争年代的光辉篇章中人们不会忘记在中国革命战争中作出重要贡献的这位忠诚的共产主义老战士，我们也不会忘记我军的这位杰出将领，我们永远记着他。
