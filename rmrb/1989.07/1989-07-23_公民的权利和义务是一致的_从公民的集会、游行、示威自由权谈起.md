The right to assemble, parade, and demonstrate is a right granted by the constitution, but during this spring and summer, a small number of people have used illegal assemblies, parades, and demonstrations as a means to create political turmoil. This issue is worth pondering. To understand this issue, it seems necessary to first clarify what the relationship between citizens' rights and obligations is, and where the line is between exercising rights in accordance with the law and abusing power.

The consistency of citizens' rights and obligations is a fundamental principle of our country's laws. Our socialist system guarantees that our citizens enjoy extensive and genuine freedom and rights, both legally and in practice. However, there has never been absolute, unrestricted freedom and rights. Any citizen, while enjoying the rights granted by the constitution and laws, must also fulfill the obligations stipulated by the constitution and laws. Taking the right to assemble, parade, and demonstrate as an example, the constitution stipulates that citizens have the freedom to assemble, parade, and demonstrate, but at the same time, it stipulates that while exercising these rights, one must not harm the interests of the state, society, collective, or the lawful freedom and rights of other citizens. The two are unified and cannot be neglected. The consistency of rights and obligations is the fundamental guideline and constraint for citizens' behavior.

Rights and obligations are complementary and mutually promoting. Fulfilling obligations is a guarantee for citizens to fully exercise their rights and is also a necessary constraint on the exercise of rights. The recent turmoil over the past two months has shown that if one only talks about the rights to assemble, parade, and demonstrate, without mentioning the corresponding obligations, and without adhering to relevant laws and regulations, thousands of people constantly parade and demonstrate, whoever wants to come out does, and whoever wants to occupy a place does, even blocking major traffic routes, interfering with government work, disrupting major state affairs, affecting factory production, and disturbing residents' lives, making it difficult even to go to work or school. This not only seriously harms the interests of the state and society but also, in fact, deprives the majority of citizens of their lawful rights.

Some people envy and romanticize the democracy of Western countries, exaggerating the "freedom of expression" there, where one can freely assemble, parade, and demonstrate, and the government "cannot impose any restrictions on this." In reality, Western countries impose very strict restrictions on citizens' exercise of rights to maintain their political system and social order. For example, they stipulate in their laws that parades and demonstrations must not use threatening, abusive, or insulting language, must not have incitement to riot or provocative speech and behavior, must not block traffic, must not illegally occupy public buildings and public places, must not obstruct official business, affect government work and party activities, and even stipulate that parades and demonstrations must not be held at night, affecting others' rest, etc. This shows that Western countries do not have unrestricted democracy and freedom that violate the laws of the state.

From the history of human civilization, the relationship between rights and obligations has undergone a process from separation to consistency. In slave and feudal societies, rights and obligations are openly separated. In capitalist societies, the bourgeoisie advocates equality before the law, and rights and obligations seem to be consistent in form, but due to the economic inequality between capitalists and workers, it is impossible for them to be equal in the exercise of rights. In a socialist society, with an economic system based on public ownership and a political system of people's democratic dictatorship, the interests of the state and the people, and the interests of the vast majority of citizens, are fundamentally consistent. This consistency of interests determines the consistency of citizens' rights and obligations. Only at this time can Marx's saying that there are no rights without obligations and no obligations without rights be basically realized. Of course, it is only when entering a communist society that rights and obligations can truly achieve a high degree of consistency.

Some young students and the masses have proposed that we assemble, parade, and demonstrate to overthrow corruption, eliminate corruption, and promote democracy, which is a patriotic act. "Patriotism is not a crime," do patriotic acts still need approval and various restrictions? This idea that as long as one has good intentions, one does not need to follow the country's laws is harmful. Citizens must follow the legal procedures to exercise their rights. Procedures are the guarantee of democracy, and if one does not act according to legal procedures, democratic rights cannot be realized. Acting according to legal procedures is both the exercise of rights and the fulfillment of obligations. Some provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have promulgated regulations on assemblies, parades, and demonstrations based on the constitution, stipulating the specific procedures for parades and demonstrations. For example, parades and demonstrations must be reported and approved, and must be conducted according to the approved time, place, route, and number of people, and must not be held in certain specific areas. The relevant laws of some Western countries are even stricter and more specific than ours. For example, it is stipulated that when applying for a parade, one must state in advance the number of participating vehicles, the number and decibels of loudspeakers, the length and width of banners and slogans, and must obtain the approval of the competent authorities; it is also stipulated that parades must not be held around the parliament, courts, military and quasi-military organizations, hospitals, residential areas, and certain specific areas. Some countries only allow parades on Saturday after 7:30 PM, or on Sundays and public holidays. It can be seen that citizens of any country exercise their rights according to legal procedures and cannot do as they please.

Some young students and the masses know that their behavior is illegal, but they think that "the law does not punish the crowd," and as long as there are many people, the law cannot do anything. The constitution of our country stipulates that all are equal before the law, and anyone who violates the law must be punished by the law. Our laws concentrate the fundamental interests of the people. Anyone who violates the law and abuses rights not only tramples on the authority and dignity of the law but also directly harms the interests of the state and the people. The idea that "the law does not punish the crowd" is at least a wrong notion of disregarding the law, and if it is allowed to spread, it will inevitably lead to a state of anarchy and even social turmoil.

Our country has initially formed a socialist legal system with the constitution as the basis, and various aspects of social life already have laws to follow, rather than no laws to follow. The prominent problem at present is that there are laws but they are not followed, laws are not strictly enforced, and lawbreakers are not punished. Therefore, for the few who violate criminal laws, they must be punished according to the law. For those with general illegal behavior, some should be given administrative penalties or administrative punishments, while for the majority, they should be educated through criticism to strengthen their legal awareness and consciously exercise their democratic rights according to the law.

The principle of the consistency of rights and obligations applies to everyone, whether it is national leaders, workers, peasants, intellectuals, or students, without exception. In our country, there are absolutely no "special citizens," and no privileges are recognized. Only talking about rights and not obligations, separating rights and obligations, and opposing them, doing whatever one wants, can only lead to extreme democratization and a state of anarchy, and be used by a few people to promote bourgeois liberalization. This is a profound lesson that should be remembered.

    公民的权利和义务是一致的
    ——从公民的集会、游行、示威自由权谈起
    王宁
    集会、游行、示威是宪法规定的公民权利，但在今年春夏之交，举行非法的集会、游行、示威却一直被极少数人用来作为制造政治动乱的主要手段。这个问题很值得深思。要弄清这个问题，看来有必要先弄清公民的权利和义务的关系是什么，依法行使权利和滥用权力的界线在哪里？
    公民的权利和义务相一致，是我国法律的一个基本原则。我们的社会主义制度从法律上和事实上保证我国公民享有广泛的、真实的自由和权利。但是，从来没有绝对的、不受任何限制的自由和权利。任何公民在享受宪法和法律规定的权利的同时，必须履行宪法和法律规定的义务。以集会、游行、示威为例，宪法规定公民有集会、游行、示威的自由，同时规定在行使这些权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利。两者是统一的，不能偏废。权利和义务的一致性，是指导和约束公民行为的根本准则。
    权利和义务是相辅相成、相互促进的。履行义务是公民充分行使权利的保障，也是对公民行使权利的必要制约。近两个月来的风波表明，只讲集会、游行、示威的权利，不讲相应的义务，不遵守有关的法律和法规，成千上万的人老是游行、示威，谁想出来就出来，谁想占什么地方就占什么地方，甚至阻塞交通要道，干扰政府工作，妨碍重大国务活动，影响工厂生产，扰乱居民生活，连上班、上学都成了问题，这不但严重地损害了国家和社会的利益，而且在事实上剥夺了广大公民依法享有的正当权利。
    有些人羡慕、美化西方国家的民主，渲染那里有随便集会、游行、示威的“表现自由”，政府“不能对这个采取什么限制”。其实，西方国家为维护本国的政治制度、稳定社会秩序，对公民行使权利的限制是非常严格的。例如，他们在法律中规定，举行游行、示威不得使用恫吓、谩骂或侮辱性语言，不得有煽动暴乱的挑衅性言论行为，不得堵塞交通，不得非法占据公共建筑物和公共场所，不得妨碍公务、影响政府工作和政党活动，甚至规定不得在深夜举行影响他人休息的游行、示威，等等。这就说明，西方国家也不存在什么不受限制的、违反国家法律所规定的民主、自由。
    从人类文明史看，权利和义务的关系，经历了一个从分离到一致的发展过程。在奴隶社会和封建社会，权利和义务表现为公开的分离。在资本主义社会，资产阶级标榜的法律面前人人平等，权利和义务在形式上似乎是一致的，但由于资本家与工人在经济上的不平等，决定了他们在行使权利上不可能是平等的。在社会主义社会，实行以公有制为基础的经济制度和人民民主专政的政治制度，国家和人民之间的利益、绝大多数公民之间的利益，从根本上是一致的。这种利益上的一致性，决定了公民权利和义务的一致性。只有在这个时候，才基本实现了马克思所说的，既没有无义务的权利，也没有无权利的义务。当然，只有在进入共产主义社会，才能真正实现权利和义务的高度一致。
    一些青年学生和群众提出，我们集会、游行、示威是为了打倒官倒、清除腐败、推进民主，是爱国行为。“爱国无罪”，难道爱国行为还要经过批准，受各种限制吗？这种以为只要有良好愿望就可以不遵守国家法律的想法是有害的。公民要行使权利，就必须遵守法律规定的程序。程序是实行民主的保障，不按照法定程序办事，民主权利就无法实现。按照法定程序行事，既是行使权利，也是履行义务。我国一些省、自治区、直辖市根据宪法相继颁布了关于集会、游行、示威的法规，规定了举行游行、示威的具体程序。如举行游行、示威要经过申报批准，要按照批准的时间、地点、路线、人数等进行，不得在某些特定的区域内举行游行、示威。一些西方国家的有关法律比我国规定的更严格、更具体。如规定在申请游行时，必须事先说明参加车辆的多少，广播喇叭的数目和分贝的大小，标语、横幅的长度和宽度，并要得到主管机关的批准；还规定在议会、法院、军事和准军事机关、医院、居民区周围及某些特定的区域不得举行游行。有些国家只准在星期六下午七点半，或者星期日和公共假日游行。由此可见，任何一个国家的公民都是依照法定程序行使权利的，而不能为所欲为。
    有些青年学生和群众明明知道自己的行为是违法的，但以为“法不责众”，只要人多势众，法律就奈何不得。我国宪法规定，法律面前人人平等，任何人违反法律都要受到法律制裁。我们的法律集中体现了人民的根本利益。任何人违反法律，滥用权利，不仅是对法律权威和尊严的践踏，而且直接损害了国家和人民的利益。那种认为“法不责众”的想法，起码是一种无视法律的错误观念，如果任其泛滥，必然导致无政府状态甚至社会动乱。
    我国已经初步形成了以宪法为基础的社会主义法律体系，社会生活的各方面已经有法可依，而不是无法可依。当前突出的问题是有法不依、执法不严、违法不究。因此，对于极少数触犯刑律的人，一定要依法惩处。对有一般违法行为的，有的要给予行政处分或行政处罚，而对大多数人则要通过批评教育，使他们增强法制观念，自觉地按照法律规定行使自己的民主权利。
    权利和义务一致性的原则，对每个人都是适用的，无论是国家领导人，无论是工人、农民、知识分子、学生，概莫能外。在我国，绝不允许有“特殊公民”，不承认有任何特权。只讲权利，不讲义务，把权利和义务割裂开来、对立起来，想怎么干就怎么干，只能导致极端民主化和无政府状态，为极少数搞资产阶级自由化的人所利用。这是一个应当铭记的深刻教训。
