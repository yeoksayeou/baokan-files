Waves are the daughters of the sea. Daughters love the sea.

    - For the joy of the sea, she blooms in all four seasons; for the sea's resounding voice, she sings with abandon; for the sea's beauty, she embeds her maidenly grace along the sea's edge...

    - She is a lovable angel, day and night following the diligent ships; she is a sensitive messenger, promptly reporting news of storms; she is also a science enthusiast, with her intricate conch shells and seashells, presenting them as her masterpieces to the tides...

The little island is the son of the sea. Sons also love the sea.

    - For the dignity of the sea, he is like a green rivet, firmly fastened between the land and the vast ocean; for the sea's tranquility, he keeps a watchful eye on the waves, never relaxing his vigilance; for the sea's instructions, he is like a giant shield, protecting a fleet of ships in the storm...

    - He has the tenacity of rocks, even if the tides submerge him a thousand times, he never leaves the sea's embrace; he has the ambition of a continent, believing that one day he will grow into a vast oasis; he has countless seeds of emotion, the lush coconut trees and palm trees are his everlasting memories planted for the vast sea...

The aged sea is overjoyed to have these two beloved children. Those waves are its uncontrollable smiles...

    浪花·小岛
    陶玉明
    浪花是海的女儿。女儿是爱海的。
    ——为了海的欢乐，她四季开放；为了海的嘹亮，她纵情歌唱；为了海的美丽，她把她少女的窈窕，嵌在海的边缘……
    ——她是可爱的天使，昼夜追随殷勤的船儿；她是敏感的信鸽，及时报告风雨的讯息；她还是一位科学迷，精巧的螺号与贝壳，是她奉给海潮的杰作……
    小岛是海的儿子，儿子也是爱海的。
   ——为了海的尊严，他像一枚绿色的铆钉，紧紧铆在陆地与大海之间；为了海的宁静，他眼盯四海的波涛，一刻也不放松警惕；为了海的嘱咐，他如一张诺大的盾，庇护着一片风雨中的帆影……
    ——他有礁石般的执著，纵使海潮千百次淹没，也不曾离开海的怀间；他有大陆样的抱负，深信总会有一天，长成了广袤的绿洲；他有无数情感的种子，茂密的椰子树和棕榈，是他为大海精心种植的永不褪色的思念……
    苍老的大海，为有这两个可爱的孩子感到无比的高兴。那一道道海浪，是它抑制不住的笑靥……
