    The World's Concern
    Global warming has already attracted the attention of the entire world.

    The Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme, Tolba, pointed out that the alarm of climate change has been sounded for everyone. The warming of the atmosphere caused by greenhouse gases has become a global problem. In 1988, the 43rd session of the United Nations discussed Malta's proposal that "climate is a part of the common wealth of mankind" and adopted the "Resolution on Human Protection of the Global Climate."

    Recently, United Nations environmental officials said that if the trend of rising global temperatures is not reversed by the end of this century, it will lead to a continuous rise in sea levels, resulting in coastal flooding, crop failures, food shortages, the outflow of "ecological refugees," and "disastrous" impacts.

    The World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme jointly convened the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, deciding to establish three working groups on scientific assessment, impact assessment, and policy recommendations to comprehensively study the problem of global warming. The second World Climate Conference, themed "Climate Change and the Modern World," will be held in 1990. It is reported that an international treaty to address global warming may be ready within three years.

    Developed countries have allocated special funds to study climate warming and ozone layer issues and have adopted new energy policies to improve their national air quality. The United States is pushing for legislation on clean air, granting more power and autonomy to environmental officials in the federal government. British Prime Minister Thatcher believes that only with environmental protection can the world achieve stable prosperity. Soviet leader Gorbachev called for global attention to environmental issues, mentioning environmental and climate protection issues more than 20 times in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on December 8, 1988. The Japanese government has also established a special research team to protect the climate and environment. Some developing countries have also made commendable progress in environmental protection.

    Why the Warming Trend?
    Over the past century, the global average surface temperature has experienced two fluctuations of cooling and warming, but the overall trend is upward. Since the 1980s, the global temperature has risen again significantly. In the 9 years from 1980 to 1988, 6 years saw an increase in temperature, with the annual average temperatures in 1980, 1983, 1987, and 1988 all far exceeding the warm years of the 1930s and 1940s, breaking historical records. The temperature in 1988 was 0.34°C higher than the 30-year average from 1949 to 1979, making it the warmest year in more than a century, which shows the intensity of the warming trend in the 1980s.

    Generally speaking, the solar radiation heat received by the Earth and the long-wave radiation heat lost by the Earth will eventually balance out, thus maintaining the Earth's temperature at a certain level, forming the Earth's equilibrium temperature. However, this balance is disrupted by the "greenhouse effect." For a long time, human society has been recklessly emitting various greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to increase at an alarming rate. Carbon dioxide is the most abundant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. Before industrialization, in the first half of the 19th century, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was about 270 PPM. By 1988, it had risen to 350 PPM, an increase of nearly 30% in a century, which is a very alarming rate. Human activities causing atmospheric pollution may change the nature of the Earth's atmosphere, disrupt the balance of factors forming the Earth's climate, and lead to global warming.

    Preventing Warming
    To prevent climate warming and control the rapid increase of greenhouse gases, countries around the world have proposed various strategies.

    Adjusting energy strategies. The continuous development of the global economy and society has led to an increasing demand for energy, putting pressure on energy needs. Currently, the primary energy consumption structure of all countries in the world is dominated by mineral fuels, with global mineral fuel consumption accounting for 87% of the total primary energy consumption. The burning of mineral fuels releases about 5 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, increasing at an average annual rate of 0.4%. By the end of this century, the global demand for oil will increase by 8%, and the demand for coal will increase by 40%. Therefore, it is necessary to control the use of mineral fuels and improve their utilization efficiency. At the same time, developing nuclear energy, solar energy, wind energy, and biomass energy is also an important way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

    Protecting forests and vegetation. The photosynthesis of forests and vegetation can absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide and release oxygen, playing an important role in regulating the global climate. From the perspective of preventing and treating climate warming, the severe destruction of forests will also be a far-reaching disaster. Therefore, stopping large-scale deforestation has also been widely recognized by countries around the world as a global climate strategy.

    Controlling population. Population growth leads to increased emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, and other pollutants into the atmosphere, which inevitably increases air pollution. Excessive population growth will also inevitably lead to deforestation, agricultural land conversion, and forest destruction for housing and fuel, resulting in the degradation of forest resources and the weakening of carbon dioxide absorption capacity. Therefore, global warming is closely related to the population issue.

    Preventing environmental pollution and being vigilant against global warming, in general, is consistent with economic and social development. Global atmospheric environmental protection requires human awakening, international cooperation, and global action.

    世界气候趋暖及其治理对策
    高振刚　赵喜晨　骆建华
        举世关注
    全球气候变暖已经引起了全世界的普遍关注。
    联合国环境规划署执行主任托尔巴指出，气候改变的警钟已向我们每个人敲响，温室气体引起的大气增温已成为全球性问题。1988年，联合国第43届大会讨论了马耳他关于“气候是人类共同财富的一部分”的提案，通过了“人类保护全球气候的决议”。
    最近，联合国环保官员说，如果到本世纪末不扭转全球气温上升趋势，会导致海平面持续上升，其结果是，沿海地区被淹，农业歉收，粮食减产，“生态难民”外流，产生“灾难性”影响。
    世界气象组织和联合国环境规划署联合召开政府间气候变化专业委员会，决定成立科学评价、影响评价、对策建议三个工作组，全面研究全球气候变暖问题。1990年将召开以“气候变化与现代世界”为主题的第二次世界气候大会。据报道，一项对付全球变暖的国际条约可能在三年内准备就绪。
    发达国家拨专款研究气候变暖和臭氧层问题，并采取一些新的能源政策，以求改善本国的大气质量。美国为通过有关清洁大气的法案，赋予联邦政府中的环保官员以更大的权力和自主权。英国首相撒切尔夫人认为，只有环境得到保护，全世界才会出现稳定的繁荣景象。苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫呼吁全球关注环境问题，他在1988年12月8日的联大发言中，有20多处提到环境和气候的保护问题。日本政府为保护气候和环境也成立了专门研讨班子。有些发展中国家在环保方面也取得了可喜的进展。为何趋暖
    近一百多年来全球平均地面气温经历了冷暖两次波动，但总趋势是上升。进入80年代以来，全球气温再次明显上升。在1980—1988年9年中有6个年度增暖，其中，1980年、1983年、1987年和1988年的年平均气温都远高于本世纪30—40年代的暖年，打破历史纪录，而1988年的气温比1949年—1979年30年的年平均气温高0.34℃，成为近一百多年来的最暖年，足见80年代变暖趋势之激烈。
    一般来讲，地球接受到的太阳辐射热量和地球散失的长波辐射热量最终会收支平衡，因而地球上的气温就会维持在某个水平上，从而形成地球上的平衡温度。然而，这种平衡却受到“温室效应”的冲击。长期以来，人类社会一直在肆无忌惮地向大气中排放各种温室气体，致使大气中的温室气体以惊人的速度急剧增多。二氧化碳是大气中含量最多的温室气体。在工业化以前，即19世纪的前半叶，大气中二氧化碳的浓度大约为270PPM，到1988年则上升到了350PPM。一百多年增长了将近30％，这种增长速度是十分惊人的。人类活动造成的大气污染可能改变地球大气的性质，打破形成地球气候诸因素之间的平衡，引起全球气候变暖。
            防止变暖
    为了防止气候变暖，控制温室气体剧增，世界各国纷纷提出了对策。
    调整能源战略。全球社会经济不断发展，能源消费量与日俱增，给能源需求带来压力。当今世界各国一次能源消费结构无不以矿物燃料为主，全球矿物燃料消费量占一次能源消费总量的87％。燃烧矿物燃料每年排入大气中的二氧化碳多达50亿吨，并以年平均0.4％的速度递增。到本世纪末，全世界石油需求量将增加8％，煤炭需求量将增加40％。因此，必须对矿物燃料的使用实行控制，并提高其有效利用率。同时，开发核能、太阳能、风能、生物能等新能源，也是减少温室气体排放的重要途径。
    保护森林和植被。森林植被的光合作用可以吸收大量二氧化碳，放出氧气，对全球气候起着重要的调节作用。从防治气候变暖的角度考虑，森林的严重破坏也将是一场影响深远的灾难。因此，制止大规模砍伐森林，也已作为全球气候战略而受到世界各国的普遍关注。
    控制人口。人口的膨胀，呼吸、燃烧和工业发展，导致排入大气的二氧化碳、氮氧化物、硫氧化物等增加，这势必增加对大气的污染。人口过分增长还势必毁林耕地、毁林盖房、毁林取薪，结果破坏森林资源，削弱吸收二氧化碳的能力。所以，世界气候变暖与人口问题密切相关。
    防治环境污染，警惕全球变暖，总的来说是与经济、社会发展相一致的。全球大气环境保护需要人类觉醒，国际合作，全球行动。
