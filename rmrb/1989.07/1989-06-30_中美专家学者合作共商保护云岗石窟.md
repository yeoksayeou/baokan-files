Chinese and American experts and scholars are collaborating to study and protect the Yungang Grottoes, which have recently been included in the "World Cultural Heritage List."

The Yungang Grottoes, located in the vicinity of Datong City, Shanxi Province, have suffered varying degrees of damage over the past 1500 years due to weathering and other factors.

Since liberation, the state has invested over 2.4 million yuan in protecting the grottoes, effectively preventing large-scale collapses. However, the problem of weathering has not been completely resolved.

Upon recommendation by the UNESCO representative in Beijing, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage invited experts from the Getty Research Institute of the United States to conduct multiple inspections of the grottoes. Both parties have signed an agreement to study and protect the grottoes.

According to the agreement, the Yungang Grottoes will undergo site waterproofing and drainage treatment, environmental monitoring, cave eave design, as well as the use of rock reinforcement and salt removal to prevent further weathering.

Recently, relevant personnel from China have traveled to the United States to discuss specific issues related to the study and protection of the grottoes with American experts.

    中美专家学者合作  共商保护云岗石窟
    新华社太原6月29日电　堪称石雕艺术不朽之作的云岗石窟，最近被列入《世界文化遗产清单》，中美双方组成的专家组，将共同对它展开研究与保护。
    位于山西省大同市境内的云岗石窟，1500年来由于风化等多种原因，受到了不同程度的损坏。
    解放以后，国家曾陆续投资240余万元用于保护石窟，虽有效地防止了石窟大面积坍塌，但其风化问题仍未能得到彻底解决。
    经联合国教科文组织研究，联合国驻京代表推荐，国家文物局邀请美国约翰·保罗·盖蒂基金会研究所的专家学者，多次对石窟进行了考察，双方还签订了研究保护石窟项目协议书。
    根据协议将对云岗石窟进行遗址防渗排水治理、环境监测、窟檐设计以及使用岩石加固和盐类的清除，以达到防止石窟风化的目的。
    日前，我国有关人员已赴美国，同美专家就研究保护石窟的具体问题进行磋商。
