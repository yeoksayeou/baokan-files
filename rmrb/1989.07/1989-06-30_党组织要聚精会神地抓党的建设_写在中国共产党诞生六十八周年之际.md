The Chinese Communist Party has traversed a journey of more than half a century, marked by both twists and triumphs. At this historic moment, when the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital has achieved decisive victory and the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has concluded successfully, we celebrate the Party's 68th birthday. Our hearts are filled with complex emotions. The Party has grown from small to large, from weak to strong, and after 28 years of arduous struggle, established New China. Over the past 40 years of hard work, we have finally built China into an independent, self-reliant, and initially prosperous socialist country. Especially in the past decade of construction and reform, the achievements have been immense and widely recognized, making it one of the best periods in the history of our nation. The people genuinely feel that these ten years have been the most comfortable. We have every reason to joyfully celebrate the Party's 68th birthday. However, the recent turmoil in the capital and some other places, which escalated into a horrifying counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, has cast a lingering shadow over the hearts of the people. The victory in the struggle and the enormous cost intertwine, the joy of victory and the profound lessons coexist, prompting us to engage in deeper reflection. One of the important conclusions drawn from this reflection is that Party organizations must seriously focus on Party building.

The occurrence and development of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot were determined by both the international climate and China's own domestic situation; it was inevitable and not subject to human will. This storm has awakened us to the fact that there are indeed hostile forces both domestically and internationally that fervently oppose us. However, it has also made us reflect deeply: the occurrence of this storm is closely related to the dispersed state of our Party. For a period, the Party's main leaders "downplayed" the Party's role, passively approached the policy of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, severely neglected Party building, spiritual civilization building, and ideological and political work, did not rely on Party organizations at all levels to carry out work, and did not emphasize the role of grassroots Party organizations as fortresses and the exemplary role of Party members. This not only greatly weakened the Party's cohesion and combat effectiveness but also caused significant damage to the Party's image and prestige. Facts have taught us, and the broad masses of Party members and the people demand, that we must exert great effort to quickly reverse this situation and cannot allow the serious impurities in the Party's ideology, organization, and style to continue. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently told the leading comrades of the Central Committee:

"Comrades of the Standing Committee must focus on Party building. The Party must be strengthened, and it cannot be delayed any longer." This is to the point and profound in meaning.

The Chinese Communist Party is the core leadership of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. As long as the Party is strong and powerful, no matter what storms, difficulties, or obstacles we encounter, they will not hinder our brave advancement. The fundamental issue is to build a strong Party. In the future, the most important and urgent task for Party organizations at all levels is to focus on strengthening the Party itself, and through Party building, strengthen political and ideological leadership over all work.

The most fundamental aspect of Party building is ideological construction. The core content of Party ideological construction is to consistently and unwaveringly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization. Bourgeois liberalization is opposed to the Four Cardinal Principles and is also opposed to the basic program of our Party. In the face of major issues, we must not be the least bit vague or waver. If we are vague or waver, we will lose our direction and cause great harm to the socialist cause. On this issue, we must always be very clear, very firm, and very resolute. The Party's propaganda tools must strengthen the propaganda of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. The education of Party members in Marxism, the Party's purpose and tasks, and Party spirit must be greatly strengthened. The study of Marxist theory by Party leaders must be earnestly grasped. On the premise of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles, we will continue to advocate the spirit of emancipating the mind, seeking truth from facts, daring to explore, and innovating boldly. The ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts determined by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is completely correct and must be adhered to. Without this ideological line, it would not have been possible to break free from the rigid frameworks, create so many new experiences in the past ten years, and thereby greatly enrich Marxist theory, especially the theory of building socialism. In the future, we will continue to strive to advance the socialist cause and Marxist theory based on new situations and new practices. But this does not mean that we can deviate from, let alone abandon, the basic principles that our Party has always adhered to.

To better play the role of a fortress, the Party must strengthen organizational construction. In this struggle to oppose the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, the vast majority of Party organizations have been strong and combat-effective, standing up to the test. They have, in extremely difficult and even extremely dangerous situations, remained steadfast in their high unity with the Party Central Committee and have done a great deal of work to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot. However, there are indeed some places and units where Party organizations are weak and dispersed and have not played the role of a fortress. This is a result of long-term neglect of Party organizational construction. We must deeply learn from this lesson and make real improvements. Party organizational construction is a long-term task, a foundational task, and it must be done solidly and persistently to stand up to the test in critical moments. The Party must manage the ideology and organizational discipline of its members. This turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot is a serious political struggle, and it is a severe test for every Party member. We must strictly examine the performance of Party members in the struggle, praise those who deserve praise, criticize and educate those who need criticism and education, and handle those who need to be handled with necessary organizational measures. The strength and role of the Communist Party lie not in the number of Party members but in the quality of the Party members. Therefore, we must adhere to the standards for Party members, set strict requirements for Party members, uphold Party discipline, and maintain the purity of the Party.

Party style construction is a matter of life and death for our Party. On this issue, we must not be complacent. Wholeheartedly serving the people is the purpose of our Party and also an excellent tradition that our Party has formed over many years. However, for a period, some Party members have forgotten the Party's purpose and abandoned the Party's excellent traditions. Some have become officials and lords, indifferent to the people's hardships; some have become slaves to money, pursuing everything for money; some have used their power for personal gain, desperately seeking benefits for themselves; some have even broken the law and discipline, become corrupt and degenerate, and turned into criminals of the people. Although such Party members and cadres are extremely few in number, their influence is extremely bad and has seriously damaged the Party's prestige. One of the reasons for such a big mess this time is the spread of corruption, which has caused a part of the masses to lose confidence in the Party and the government. While domestic and foreign enemies seize on this point, exaggerate it, and maliciously try to deny the Party's leadership and overthrow the socialist system. We must keep the alarm bells ringing. Currently, we must seriously handle a batch of major cases, take swift and decisive action, and punish them strictly according to Party discipline and state laws, and make them public. On the issue of combating corruption, as long as we truly do this, we will definitely gain the trust and support of the people.

The recently concluded Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has important historical significance. The plenary session seriously analyzed and summarized the experience and lessons from the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, made necessary adjustments to some members of the Central Leadership, and established a new Central Leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary. The people are happy about this. We believe that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, after this storm and through the joint efforts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, we will turn the experience and lessons into a powerful driving force for advancing history. Our Party has great hope, and our country has great hope. All Party comrades must be spirited, united as one, rally the masses, work hard, and with full confidence, continue to advance the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening up!

    党组织要聚精会神地抓党的建设
    ——写在中国共产党诞生六十八周年之际
    中国共产党走过了半个多世纪曲折而光荣的历程。在平息发生在首都的反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利、党的十三届四中全会圆满闭幕的历史时刻，我们迎来了党的68岁生日。此时此刻，我们的心情是很复杂的。我们的党从小到大，由弱到强，经过28年艰苦卓绝的斗争，创建了新中国；又经过40年的艰苦奋斗，终于把中国建设成一个独立自主、初步繁荣强盛的社会主义国家。特别是十年建设和改革，成就巨大，举世公认，是建国以来最好的历史时期之一。人民群众由衷地感到，这十年的日子是最舒心的。我们有理由高高兴兴地度过党的68岁生日。但是，不久前首都和一些地方发生动乱，直至在北京演变成一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱，在人民的内心投下一时拂之不去的阴影。斗争的胜利和巨大的代价交织，胜利的喜悦和深刻的教训并存，促使我们要进行更深层次的反思。党的组织要认真抓好党的建设，这是从反思中获得的重要结论之一。
    这次动乱和反革命暴乱的发生和发展，是国际大气候和中国自己的小气候决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的。这场风波的到来，使我们警醒：国内外确有敌对势力疯狂地反对我们；但同时也使我们深思，这场风波的发生，同我们党的涣散状况有很大关系。一个时期以来，党的主要领导人“淡化”党的作用，消极对待坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，不依靠党的各级组织进行工作，不强调发挥基层党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。这不仅大大削弱了党的凝聚力和战斗力，而且使党的形象、党的威信蒙受很大损失。事实教育我们，广大党员和人民群众要求我们，必须花大气力迅速扭转这种局面，不能再任党的思想、组织、作风严重不纯的现象继续下去了。邓小平同志在不久前对中央的领导同志说：
  “常委的同志要聚精会神地抓党的建设，这个党该抓了，不抓不行了。”这是切中要害，意义深长的。
    中国共产党是中国各族人民的领导核心。只要党是坚强有力的，在我们面前，无论遇到任何狂风巨浪、艰难险阻，都不能妨碍我们奋勇前进。根本的问题，是要把党建设好。今后各级党组织一项最为重要紧迫的任务，是聚精会神地把党的自身建设好，通过加强党的建设，加强对各项工作的政治思想领导。
    党的建设，最根本的是思想建设。党的思想建设的中心内容，是要旗帜鲜明地、始终一贯地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。资产阶级自由化是和四项基本原则相对立，也是和我们党的基本纲领相对立的。在大是大非面前，我们决不能有任何的含糊和动摇。含糊了，动摇了，就会迷失方向，就会给社会主义事业造成极大的损害。在这个问题上，任何时候都必须十分清醒，十分明确，十分坚定。党的舆论工具要切实加强对坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的宣传。对党员的马克思主义教育，党的宗旨和任务的教育，党性教育，要大力加强。党的领导干部的马克思主义理论学习，要切实抓紧。在坚持四项基本原则的前提下，我们要一如既往地提倡解放思想，实事求是，勇于探索，大胆创新的精神。党的十一届三中全会所确定的解放思想、实事求是的思想路线，是完全正确的，必须坚持。如果没有这条思想路线，就不可能从僵化的条条框框中解放出来，创造十年来这么许多新鲜的经验，从而大大丰富了马克思主义的理论特别是关于建设社会主义的理论。今后，我们仍将根据新的情况、新的实践，努力把社会主义事业推向前进，努力把马克思主义理论推向前进。但这决不是可以偏离，更不允许放弃我们党所一贯遵循的基本原则。
    党要更好地发挥战斗堡垒作用，就必须大力加强组织建设。在这场反对动乱和平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，绝大多数党组织是坚强的、有战斗力的，是经得起考验的。他们在极端困难甚至是极度危险的情况下，坚定地和党中央保持高度一致，为制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱作了大量的工作。但是确有一些地方和单位的党组织，软弱涣散，没能发挥战斗堡垒作用。这是长期以来忽视党的组织建设的一个恶果。我们要深深记取这个教训，切实加以改进。党的组织建设是一项长期的工作，打基础的工作，要扎扎实实，常抓不懈，才能在关键时刻经得起考验。党要管党员的思想，管党员的组织纪律。这次动乱和反革命暴乱，是一场严重的政治斗争，对每一个党员都是严峻的考验。要严格考察党员在斗争中的表现，该表扬的要表扬，该批评教育的要批评教育，该处理的要作必要的组织处理。共产党的力量和作用，主要不在于党员的数量，而在于党员的素质。所以，必须坚持党员的标准，对党员提出严格的要求，严肃党的纪律，保持党的纯洁性。
    党风建设是关系到我们这个党生死存亡的一件大事。在这个问题上我们决不能掉以轻心。全心全意为人民服务，是我们党的宗旨，也是我们党多年来形成的一个优良传统。但是，一个时期以来，一些党员忘记了党的宗旨，丢掉了党的优良传统。有的人当官作老爷，对人民疾苦漠不关心；有的人“一切向钱看”，成了金钱的奴隶；有的人以权谋私，拚命为自己捞取好处；有的人甚至违法乱纪、腐化堕落，成了人民的罪人。这样的党员和党员干部虽然为数极少，但影响极坏，严重地损害了党的威信。这次出这样大的乱子，其中一个原因，是由于腐败现象的滋生，使一部分群众对党和政府丧失了信心。而国内外的敌人则抓住这一点加以利用，渲染夸大，妄图否定党的领导，推翻社会主义制度。对此，我们要警钟长鸣。当前要认真抓一批大案要案，雷厉风行地抓，按照党纪国法严加惩处，并公之于众。在惩治腐败的问题上，只要真正这样做了，一定会得到人民的信赖和拥护。
    具有重要历史意义的十三届四中全会不久前圆满结束了。全会认真分析和总结了制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱斗争中的经验教训，对中央领导机构的部分成员进行了必要的调整，确定了以江泽民同志为总书记的新的中央领导集体，对此，人民是高兴的。我们相信，在党中央的领导下，经过这次风浪的考验，经过全党和全国人民共同努力，把经验教训变成推动历史前进的强大动力，我们的党大有希望，我们的国家大有希望。全党同志要振奋精神，同心同德，团结群众，艰苦奋斗，满怀信心地把我们的社会主义现代化建设事业和改革开放事业继续推向前进！
