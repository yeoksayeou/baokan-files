People's Daily, Nanning, July 12th - Reporter Zheng Shengfeng reports: Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has tightened its net against corruption. Chen Huiguang, Secretary of the Regional Party Committee, sternly pointed out at a meeting of regional government leaders that the investigation of major cases must be pushed forward to advance the cause of clean governance.

Liu Mingzu, Deputy Secretary of the Regional Party Committee, listed several cases that highlight the severity of the problem and the urgency of combating corruption: In Lubei County, 10 officials from the Land Management Bureau collectively embezzled 100,000 yuan of public funds; Huang Lianfu, an alternate member of the Sixth Liuszhou Municipal Committee, a representative of the Eighth Liuszhou People's Congress, and deputy manager of the Liuszhou Electrical Appliances Company, used his position to accept 60,900 yuan in bribes; The Guangxi Autonomous Region Agricultural, Livestock, and Fisheries Bureau's Thrift and Self-Reliance Development Service Company was involved in smuggling goods worth over 20 million yuan, a case that implicated the former head of the bureau and more than 10 companies in Guangdong, Hainan, and Hong Kong.

Since last July, the regional disciplinary inspection agencies have investigated 1,106 cases of party member misconduct, including 7 cases involving provincial and department-level officials and 124 cases involving county and bureau-level officials. The regional supervision system has investigated 1,292 cases of various misconducts, resulting in 1,108 individuals being directly or recommended for disciplinary action. The regional procuratorial system has initiated investigations into 1,017 economic cases, with the number of cases investigated in the first half of this year increasing by 79.8% compared to the same period last year. The Guangxi Regional Party Committee and the Regional People's Government have decided to focus on investigating 18 major cases of embezzlement, bribery, smuggling, and profiteering in the near future.
