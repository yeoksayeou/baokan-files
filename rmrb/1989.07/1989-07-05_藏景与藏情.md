Scenery has its skilled and unskilled aspects, emotions have their depths and shallows.

Those who create scenery with skill and elegance often prefer to hide it, so that visitors may unexpectedly enter a secluded realm, and travelers may encounter profound scenery in an open setting. This method of creation reflects the creator's ability to expand the spatial atmosphere, intensify spatial harmony, strengthen spatial power, and enrich the beauty of space. It contrasts with the natural beauty of openness, vastness, and clarity (this is not to say that nature lacks secluded realms).

Those who love deeply often prefer to hide their emotions, so that the recipient may sense the depth of the lover's feelings in limited comfort, and the beloved may reflect on the inner meaning of praise in objective admiration. Genuine, tangible love is not merely the outward expression of emotions or the spoken words, but also relies on the depth of feelings and the echoes of the soul. Believable, precious love is not a phenomenon that can be replaced by artistic exaggeration or logical force, but rather a beautiful hope and emotional state that is inseparable from the system of human values.

Hiding emotions is not the same as being reserved. Being reserved is a trampling of true feelings; hiding emotions, on the other hand, is a beneficial accumulation of emotions. Hiding emotions in reason often allows emotions and reason to ferment, becoming more mellow. It is a special preservative for the long-term freshness and purity of emotions and reason. Those with excellent emotional cultivation often show the most restraint in their deepest love, but in reality, they love more appropriately and reasonably, maintaining the enduring nature and vitality of their emotions.

    藏景与藏情
    景有巧、拙之分，情有深、浅之别。
    造景巧丽者，多喜藏景，以令游人于不意中踏入幽境，以诱旅客于豁然中偶遇景深。这种营造法式，体现着造景人拓展空间意境，浓化空间谐趣，强化空间力度，丰富空间美的容量的造诣和艺术气质，它和自然的豁朗之美、辽阔之美、鲜明之美恰成对照（这不是说自然界没有幽境）。
    爱之深沉者，多喜藏情，以教收受者于有限的抚慰中体察爱者之深蕴，以诱发被爱者于客观的赞美中追思内涵之意趣。真实、可感的爱，不只是具象的情态、具声的言辞，更有赖于情感的内蕴、心灵深处的回音。可信、可贵的爱，不是艺术的夸张和逻辑的力量可以取代的情感现象，而是与人生价值体系不可分离的美好希冀和情绪态势。
    藏情，不是矜持。矜持，是对真情的蹂躏；而藏情，则是对情感的有益的积淀。藏情于理，往往可以使情理发酵，变得更加醇美，是情感与义理长期保鲜、保洁的特效剂。情感修养佼佼者，对于越是爱之至深的人，往往越是表现得爱的“吝啬”，而实际上，则是爱得越近情近理，恰如其分，以维系其情的悠远性和生命力。
