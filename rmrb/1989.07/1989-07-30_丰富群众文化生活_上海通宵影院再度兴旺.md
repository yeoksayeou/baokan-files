Since the summer, all-night movie screenings in Shanghai have become popular again. Last night alone, nearly 30,000 citizens spent their weekend nights in cinemas.

Some viewers believe that all-night movies not only help to diversify life but also allow them to see new films earlier. Generally, the films shown at these all-night screenings are released about half a month earlier than those shown during the day.

Shanghai started all-night cinema screenings in 1987. Currently, Shanghai has four cinemas with excellent facilities that screen all-night movies every day. More than 40 cinemas offer all-night screenings on weekends, and about 20 cinemas do so during holidays.

    丰富群众文化生活
    上海通宵影院再度兴旺
    据新华社上海7月30日电　（记者赵兰英）入夏以来，上海的通宵电影放映再度兴旺起来，仅昨晚就有近3万市民在影院度过周末之夜。
    一些观众认为，通宵电影不仅可以调节生活，也可以先睹为快，这里的影片一般比白天放映的要早半个月。
    上海自1987年起开办通宵影院，目前，上海已有4家设施上乘的影院天天放通宵影片，有40余家影院开办周末通宵电影场，还有20来家在节假日开办。
