    Madagascar's Minister of Information, Simon Pierre, announced this morning on the radio that the government of Madagascar has thwarted a coup attempt. The situation in the capital is currently calm.

    According to the minister, at 6 a.m. today, a group of armed civilians occupied the national radio station and read out a proclamation signed by Joama Ernest, announcing the formation of a new government to replace the government of Ratsiraka. After reading the proclamation, the group quickly fled the radio station. The true identity of Ernest, the leader of the failed coup, is still unclear.

    Pierre called on the nation to remain calm and stated that a public investigation into the incident will be conducted. President Ratsiraka, who had just participated in the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, is currently in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, attending the summit of the Organization of African Unity.

    马达加斯加发生未遂政变
    新华社塔那那利佛7月24日电　马达加斯加新闻部长西蒙·皮埃尔今晨在电台宣布，马达加斯加政府挫败了一起政变阴谋，目前首都局势平静。
    据这位部长说，今晨6点，一股武装平民占领了国家电台，宣读了一项由乔马·埃奈斯特签署的成立新政府、取代拉齐拉卡政府的公报。这伙人在宣读完公报后，很快逃离了电台。目前尚不清楚未遂政变领导人埃奈斯特的真实身份。
    皮埃尔要求全国人民保持镇静，并说将对此事件进行公开调查。拉齐拉卡总统在参加完法国革命200周年庆祝活动后，目前正在埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴参加非洲统一组织首脑会议。
