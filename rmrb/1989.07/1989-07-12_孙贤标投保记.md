Sun Xianbiao, a young farmer from Dayuan Village in Chenqiao Township, Jinhu County, Jiangsu Province, is a young man praised by everyone in the village. On October 25th of last year, Sun sold a fat pig to the township food station for 398 yuan. On his way home, he encountered township insurance agent Wan Hongli. Wan Hongli persuaded him to participate in a prize-winning personal accident insurance with a return of the principal. This type of insurance has both personal insurance and prize-saving characteristics. Sun found it novel and immediately used 350 yuan from the pig sale to purchase 7 prize-winning insurance policies, each with a coverage amount of 600 yuan, totaling 4200 yuan. The insurance term is 3 years, with a draw held each year.

Time flew by, and more than three months passed. One evening, after a hard day's work, Sun wanted to haul a few more carts of soil to expand his pigpen. However, he did not expect that while starting the hand-tractor, the crank handle slipped from his hand. The spinning crank handle mercilessly struck Sun on the head, immediately causing blood to flow. Sun quickly lost consciousness. Although he was later rescued by the hospital, his left eye lost its sight.

What a good young man! The entire village mourned his accident. Fortunately, that day on the road, Sun used the money from selling the pig to purchase 7 prize-winning personal insurance policies. Now, the insurance policies came into effect. After investigation and verification by the county insurance company, according to the regulation of paying 50% of the total insurance amount for the loss of one eye, Sun was paid 2100 yuan in insurance money.

    江苏省金湖县陈桥乡大元村青年农民孙贤标，是村上人人都夸奖的好小伙子，去年10月25日，小孙卖给乡食品站一头肥猪，得款398元，在回家的途中，小孙遇到乡保险代办员万洪礼。万洪礼动员他参加有奖人身意外伤害还本保险，这一险种，具有人身保险和有奖储蓄双重性质。小孙感到新奇，当即用卖猪款350元购买下了7张有奖保险单，每张单保险金额600元，累计保险金额4200元。保险期限3年，每年开奖一次。
    时间一晃，3个多月过去了。一天晚上，劳累了一天的小孙，还想再拖运几车土扩建猪圈。谁知平风起巨浪，小孙万万没有想到，在启动手扶拖拉机时，不慎摇把滑手。飞旋的摇把无情地砸在小孙头上，顿时鲜血直流，小孙很快就昏厥过去。后来，虽经医院抢救，小孙的左眼还是失去了光明。
    多好的一个小伙子啊，发生意外事故，全村人为他痛惜。所幸的是那天在路上小孙用卖猪款购买了7张有奖人身保险单。这下保险单开口说话了。县保险公司经过调查核实，按照一目失明赔付全部保险金50％的规定，付给小孙保险金2100元。
