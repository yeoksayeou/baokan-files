The Communist Party of China's Guizhou Provincial Committee has decided to conduct a thorough inspection of the implementation of personnel discipline by county-level and above party committees, party groups, and personnel departments within this year.

The inspection will focus on the following areas: whether the selection and appointment of cadres strictly follow the prescribed procedures, fully adhere to the mass line, undergo examination by personnel departments, and are decided collectively by party committees and party groups; whether actions are strictly taken in accordance with the law; whether cadres are appointed according to organizational regulations and the specified number of positions, and whether there are any irregular job titles; whether there are any improper practices in the work of cadre assignments and salaries; and the situation regarding the cadre appointment filing system and confidentiality work.

The Guizhou Provincial Committee's Organizational Department issued a _Notice_ emphasizing that the inspection work should not be merely formalistic or a mere formality. The situation of the inspection work, especially the serious violations of personnel discipline discovered during the inspection and the opinions and suggestions for resolving them, should be seriously reported to the party committees and party groups. After the inspection work is completed, a summary report should be promptly submitted to the higher-level organizational departments. Local and unit party committees and party groups should, in conjunction with the inspection of the implementation of personnel discipline, conduct a democratic life review and genuinely improve their work.

    贵州检查人事纪律执行情况
    本报讯　中共贵州省委决定，今年内对县以上党委、党组和组织人事部门执行干部人事纪律的情况，进行一次认真检查。
    检查内容重点是：在选拔任用干部中是否严格按照规定的程序办事，充分走群众路线，经过组织人事部门考察，由党委、党组集体讨论决定；是否严格依法办事；是否按机构规格和规定的职数配备干部，有无乱设职务名称；在干部调配、工资等工作中是否有不正之风；以及干部任用备案制度、保密工作等方面的情况。
    贵州省委组织部为此发出的《通知》强调，检查工作不能搞形式，走过场。对检查工作的情况，特别是检查中发现的严重违反干部人事纪律的问题及解决的意见、建议，要认真向党委、党组汇报。检查工作结束后，要及时向上级组织部门写出总结报告。各地、各单位党委、党组要结合检查干部人事纪律的执行情况，过一次民主生活，切实改进工作。
