The People's Daily reports: "Under any circumstances, we cannot accept the people's things for free." Since June 20, a certain unit of the martial law troops has dispatched 8 "search and return teams." After a month of efforts, they have found all 46 units and 420 individuals who, during difficult times, spontaneously supported and visited the troops without leaving their names, and have returned items and money totaling 7,386 yuan.

During the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riot, this unit has made significant contributions to the country and the people. Amidst widespread praise, the unit maintains strict discipline, seriously reflects on its shortcomings, and builds its execution of discipline on a highly conscious foundation. The unit's party committee decided that they must find a way to locate the units and individuals who, during the unit's initial entry into the city and when it was besieged at the Great Hall of the People, spontaneously supported and visited the troops, and return the items they used and consumed at their original prices.

Due to the complex situation at the time, many of the people who spontaneously supported and visited the troops did not want to leave their unit names, adding difficulty to the search. When the unit first entered the city and was besieged, a research institute sent a meal of steamed buns to the troops, but they only knew it was a research institute without knowing which one. To find this unit, they almost searched every large and small research institute in Beijing. Finally, they identified it as the Beijing Municipal Urban Planning and Design Institute and returned 115 yuan for the meal. When the unit was besieged at the Great Hall of the People, a unit under the Ministry of Energy continuously sent four meals of steamed buns to the troops. During the search, they inquired from the Ministry of Energy headquarters to every subordinate unit in Beijing, repeatedly searching several times, and finally found the Second Thermal Power Plant that sent the meals. Once, an elderly-looking person sent water to the troops, and a soldier accidentally broke two of the elderly person's cups. At the time, they did not have the chance to compensate before the unit hurried into the city. During the return process, they went to the vicinity of where the water was sent and conducted a thorough search based on the recorded facial features. When they returned new cups to the elderly person, he was moved and said, "Iron Army! Truly an iron army that does not take even a needle!"

    群众慰问戒严部队不留姓名
    人民卫士清还物品踏破铁鞋
    本报讯　“不论什么情况下都不能白吃白拿群众的东西。”戒严部队某部从6月20日起，派出8个“查找清还小组”，经过一个月的努力，全部找到困难时期支援慰问他们而未留名的46个单位和420名群众，还清物品折款7386元。
    在平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，这个部队为国家为人民立了功，在一片赞誉声中，部队从严要求，认真查找不足，把执行纪律建立在高度自觉的基础上。部队党委做出决定，一定要想办法查找到在部队初次进城被围困和人民大会堂被围困的困难时期自发地支援慰问部队的单位和群众，对所食所用物品按价清还。
    由于当时情况比较复杂，自发支援慰问的群众很多不愿留下单位姓名，给查找工作增加了困难。部队初次进城被围时，一家研究所给部队送了一顿馒头，但他们只知道是研究所，而不知道是什么研究所。为了找到这家单位，他们几乎找遍了北京市所有的大小研究所，最后搞清是北京市市政设计院研究所，按价清还了115元钱的饭款。部队在人民大会堂被围时，能源部下属一个单位连续给部队送了四顿馒头。查找中，他们从能源部机关到下属驻京单位一个单位一个单位打听，反复找了好几遍，终于找到了给部队送饭的第二热电厂。有一次，一位老干部模样的人给部队送水时，一名战士不小心打坏了老同志两只杯子，当时未来得及赔偿部队就匆忙进城了。清还中，他们来到当时送水的地方附近根据记下的相貌特征进行了认真查找。当他们将新杯子还给这位老同志时，他感动地说：“铁军！真是秋毫无犯的铁军！”（张怀恩　白小平）
