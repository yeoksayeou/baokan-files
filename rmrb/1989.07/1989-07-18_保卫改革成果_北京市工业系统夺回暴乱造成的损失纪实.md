    Defending the Fruits of Reform
    – Beijing's Industrial System Recovers Losses from the Riots
    By Zhang Shuzheng, People's Daily Reporter

    In late spring of 1989, Beijing was in turmoil.

    The riots and counter-revolutionary rebellion instigated by a small number of people caused significant losses to Beijing's industrial production. In May and the first half of June alone, production value decreased by over 700 million yuan, and tax revenue decreased by nearly 200 million yuan. From June 4th to 9th, the attendance rate of most enterprises was only 20-40%, and production was either halted or severely disrupted. Around the 10 train stations in Beijing, cargo yards were piled high with goods. Raw materials could not be transported out, and industrial products could not be shipped out...

    Time was of the essence; industrial production could not be allowed to remain paralyzed. After the counter-revolutionary rebellion was suppressed, under the urgent mobilization of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, the entire city's industrial system launched a fierce struggle to defend the fruits of reform and recover the losses from the riots.

    Factory Managers' "Exceptional" Management

    At the steel structure workshop of Beijing Hoisting Machinery Factory in Guangqumenwai, factory manager Song Pingxuan and the deputy manager in charge of production, Liu Hongyi, and the chief engineer, Ji Guoli, were on-site inspecting and directing operations. Manager Song instructed the workshop staff, "We must produce both the 16-ton and 20-ton truck cranes! Neither can be delayed! We must deliver on schedule as per the contract. The uneven supply of materials before and after the riots has caused some production bottlenecks, which we must resolve through 'overtime work'!"

    Old Song lives in "Hepingli," but for over a month, he has been staying at the factory to direct operations on-site.

    Thousands of factory managers across Beijing, like Song Pingxuan, have broken the rules and adopted "exceptional" management methods to direct production.

    The Shunyi County Meat Processing Plant, responsible for supplying fresh meat to over 1,500 government supply points and 153 grocery stores in Dongcheng District, investigated the traffic situation and mapped out detour routes under the guidance of the factory manager, Wang En. Since mid-April, this plant has not missed a single day of fresh meat supply. In the first half of June, despite the greatest difficulties in processing and transporting fresh meat, the daily supply increased from the usual 50,000 kilograms to 100,000 kilograms.

    Beijing Internal Combustion Engine Factory, which implemented the contract responsibility system early on, has always had good economic performance. However, the turmoil and rebellion caused the factory to lose production of 10,000 engines, resulting in a loss of 200 million yuan in production value and 50 million yuan in profits. In June, it was difficult to pay the wages of the 20,000 employees. At this time, factory manager Huang Jixin paid more attention to ideological and political work, saying everywhere in the factory, "To get paid, we must protect the fruits of reform, complete the contract targets, and recover the losses caused by the rebellion!" Huang's ideological work took effect. Several deputy managers of the 492Q gasoline engine factory led the way, jumping into the foul-smelling oil return pool, and shoveling out the dirty and smelly sediment. The repair of the test oil depot was completed ahead of schedule. The entire factory worked tirelessly, producing 300 engines on June 12th, 400 on the 13th, and reaching 640 on the 16th, setting a new record for daily assembly.

    The Workers' Enthusiasm is Astonishing

    Fengtai West Station is a key hub for the transportation lines of the North China region and the Beijing Railway Bureau, and the main channel for transporting coal from Shanxi. Since mid-June, all station staff have implemented the city's emergency deployment, striving to handle more trains, more disassembly, more grouping, and more departures, achieving outstanding results of daily disassembly of 80-90 trains and grouping of 70-80 trains. They supported the transportation of open-top cars on the Fengsha line with an average of over 2,000 cars per day, providing strong support for the transportation of coal from Shanxi by the Datong Division.

    The piles of goods around the 10 railway cargo yards in Beijing gradually disappeared. The goods that should be unloaded and loaded were gradually able to be handled on time. By June 21st, the number of freight cars transporting industrial products from Beijing to other places had reached 2,775.

    Postal workers across the city worked hard to restore communication services. By June 11th, all 113 postal and telecommunications sub-bureaus in the city had reopened, and all 89 mail routes were operational. The backlog of 136,000 telegrams was all delivered.

    By June 12th, all public buses and trams in the urban and suburban areas had resumed operations.

    By June 20th, all 5,000-plus municipal enterprises had resumed production, and the attendance rate of workers had returned to normal.

    The workers of Beijing Printing Plant No. 3, responsible for printing and binding textbooks for colleges, universities, and primary and secondary schools, worked continuously, completing two shifts' worth of work in one day. The 41 types of textbooks delivered by the Higher Education Press, the 27 types delivered by Peking University, and 840,000 textbooks for colleges and universities, as well as several million primary and secondary school textbooks, were all printed and bound on time.

    Hundreds of thousands of workers from the municipal pharmaceutical, chemical, light, and textile industries did not waste time at work and did not rest on "factory holidays," making up for lost time and completing some important production tasks assigned by the state.

    Initial Victory

    Report after report, like victory bulletins, flew to the compound of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government, and to the red building of the Municipal Economic Commission.

    The Municipal Electronics Industry Office had the best economic performance in the first half of the year among the 18 industrial bureaus and companies in the city. In their report, they stated: "From January to June, a production value of 1.79 billion yuan was completed, achieving a nearly 10% increase in both production value and profits compared to the same period last year."

    The Textile Industry Corporation is the industry with the most difficulties in production within the industrial system, but they reported on behalf of all 107 enterprises in the corporation, "In the first half of the year, a production value of 1.508 billion yuan was created, 522 million yuan in profits were handed over, and 4.7 billion yuan in export delivery value was achieved, all exceeding the planned targets."

    The Municipal Bureau of Statistics reported: "The main economic indicators of industrial production in the city in the first half of the year all exceeded the planned targets. Among them, the total production value increased by 8.7% compared to the same period last year, and the economic benefits maintained synchronized growth."

    The mayor and the director of the Municipal Economic Commission reviewed the reports, feeling both joy and bitterness. From the turmoil to the rebellion, spanning three months, and yet the industrial production of the entire city basically achieved "half the time, half the task." How difficult it was! "The people have the power to turn things around," and practice once again demonstrated the strength of the working class with a high sense of responsibility.

    保卫改革成果
    ——北京市工业系统夺回暴乱造成的损失纪实
    本报记者　张书政
    己巳春夏之交，动荡不安的北京。
    极少数人制造的动乱和反革命暴乱，给北京工业生产造成巨大损失，仅5月份和6月上旬，就减少产值7亿多元，减少利税近2亿元。6月4日至9日，大多数企业职工出勤率只有20～40％，处于停产、半停产状态。围绕北京城区10个站的铁路货场，站站堆积如山，运进的原材料取不走，应发的工业品送不出去……
    刻不容缓，工业生产不能再瘫痪下去了。平息反革命暴乱之后，在北京市委、市政府的紧急动员下，全市工业系统开始了一场保卫改革成果，夺回暴乱损失的奋力拚搏。
    厂长们的“超常式”管理
    广渠门外北京起重机器厂的钢结构车间，厂长宋屏轩和主管生产的副厂长刘宏仪、总工程师纪国立正在现场检查指挥。宋厂长对车间干部工人布置说：“16吨和20吨两种汽车吊车都要生产，哪种也不能丢！都要按合同期限交货。暴乱前后进料不均衡，造成一些工序矛盾，要用‘加班加点’来解决！”
    老宋家住“和平里”，一个多月吃、住在厂坚持现场指挥。
    北京各工业企业数千名厂长，都像宋屏轩这样，打破常规，采用“超常式”管理，指挥生产。
    担负东城区1500多个机关供应点、153个副食店鲜肉供应的顺义县肉类加工厂，在交通受阻情况下，厂长王恩带人踏查，了解市区交通受阻情况和划定绕行路线图。4月中旬以来，这个厂鲜肉上市一天也未间断。6月上半月，加工鲜肉和运肉的困难最大，可是，日上市量由平时的5万公斤上升到10万公斤。
    实行承包制较早的北京内燃机总厂，经济效益一直很好。但动乱和暴乱使该厂减少1万台发动机产量，企业损失2000万元产值和500万元利润，6月份全厂2万名职工的工资难于发放。这时，厂长黄技新比平时更加注重思想政治工作，他在厂里到处讲：“要想开工资，必须保住改革成果，完成承包指标，把暴乱造成的损失夺回来！”黄厂长的思想工作起了作用。492Q汽油机分厂几位副厂长带头跳下臭气熏天的回油池，一桶桶地打捞着又脏又臭的沉淀物，抢修试车油库的工程提前竣工了。全厂上下拚命干，6月12日，“北内”生产发动机300台，13日达到400台，到16日，实现640台，创日装配量历史最高纪录。
    工人的干劲令人惊叹
    丰台西站，是华北地区和北京铁路局运输干线的枢纽，也是晋煤外运的主要通道。6月中旬以来，全站职工落实市里的紧急部署，努力多接车、多解体、多编组、多开车，创造日均解体80至90列、编组70至80列的优异成绩，向丰沙线运输空敞车日均2000多车，为大同分局晋煤外运以有力支援。
    围绕北京城区10个车站的铁路货场，堆积如山的货物逐渐消失了。应该卸车的和应该装车的，渐渐能够按时“吞、吐”了。到6月21日，从北京发往外地的运输工业产品的列车，已达2775节车皮。
    全市邮政职工努力恢复通信生产，到6月11日，全市113个邮电支局全部开门营业，89条邮路条条通邮，积压的13.6万封电报全部投送。
    到6月12日，城区和市郊所有线路的公共电、汽车全部恢复营运。
    到6月20日，市属5000多家企业全部恢复生产，职工出勤率达到正常水平。
    担负印刷、装订大专院校教材和中、小学生课本任务的市印刷三厂，职工们连续作战，一天干两个班的活，高等教育出版社交付的41种教材、北京大学等交付的27种、84万册教材和几百万册中、小学课本，全部按期印、订完毕。
    市医药、化工、一轻、二轻等工业总公司所属的几十万名职工，上班不浪费工时，“厂休日”不休息，抢回了时间，完成了国家交付的一些重要生产任务。
    初战告捷
    一份份报表，像一张张捷报，飞向市委、市政府大院，飞向市经委红楼。
    市电子工业办公室在全市18个工业局、总公司中上半年经济效益最好，他们在报表中报告：1至6月份完成产值17.9亿元，与去年同期比，实现产值、利润同步增长近10％。
    纺织工业总公司是工业系统生产中困难最多的行业，但他们代表全公司107家企业报告“上半年创产值15.08亿元，上交利润5220万元，出口交货值4.7亿元，均超额完成计划。
    市统计局报告：全市上半年工业生产主要经济指标均超额完成计划。其中，总产值比去年同期增长8.7％，经济效益保持同步增长。
    市长和市经委主任看过一张张报表，心头掠过喜悦，也掠过酸楚。从动乱到暴乱，前后3个月，而全市工业生产基本实现了“时间过半，完成任务过半”，多么不容易啊！“人民自有回天力”，实践再次显示了具有高度主人翁责任感的工人阶级的力量。
