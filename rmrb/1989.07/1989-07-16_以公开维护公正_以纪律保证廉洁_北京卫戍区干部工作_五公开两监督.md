The Beijing Garrison Party Committee and political department have taken the lead in their own work, using transparency to uphold justice and discipline to ensure integrity. They have adopted the “five opens and two supervisions” method in selecting cadets for school and promoting and using cadres, effectively promoting party conduct and anti-corruption efforts.

In recent years, the Beijing Garrison Party Committee and political department have insisted on eliminating corruption as a key task. After the selection of cadets began this year, to prevent potential irregularities, the Standing Committee of the Party Committee held a special meeting to formulate measures for fair competition. They stipulated that regardless of whose relatives or children are involved, if they do not meet the conditions, no one can intervene, and anyone who violates the regulations will be subject to party discipline.

Recently, the Military Commission decided to directly promote outstanding soldier cadres who performed well in enforcing martial law and to send them to school. For this, the Garrison Party Committee and political department changed the previous method of having the personnel department alone conduct investigations and provide opinions for promoting cadres and selecting students. They adopted the method of having the personnel department work with the discipline inspection commission to conduct investigations and provide opinions together. To facilitate public supervision, they also adopted the “five opens,” namely, open policies and regulations, open selection criteria, open selection procedures, open selection candidates, and open selection results. Because the Garrison Party Committee and political department are resolute and the measures are effective, since the promotion work began, there have been no instances of calling the personnel department to intervene or sending notes.

    以公开维护公正　以纪律保证廉洁
    北京卫戍区干部工作“五公开两监督”
    本报讯　北京卫戍区党委和政治机关从自身抓起，以公开维护公正，以纪律保证廉洁，在选拔学员进校和提拔使用干部等方面采取“五公开两监督”的方法，有效地促进了党风和廉政建设。
    近几年来，北京卫戍区党委和政治机关坚持把清除腐败作为一项重要工作来抓。今年选拔学员的工作开始后，为避免可能出现的不正之风，党委常委专门召开会议，制订了平等竞争的措施，并规定不论谁的亲属子女，不符合条件谁说情也不行，谁违犯规定以党纪论处。
    最近，军委决定从执行戒严任务的部队中表现突出的优秀士兵骨干直接提干和保送入学。对此，卫戍区党委和政治机关改变了过去提升干部和选拔学员由干部部门一家考察拿意见的方法，采取了干部部门会同纪委一起考察，一起拿意见。为了便于群众监督，他们还采取了“五公开”，即有关政策规定公开，选拔条件公开，选拔程序公开，选拔对象公开，选定结果公开。由于卫戍区党委和政治机关决心坚决，措施得力，目前这项提干工作开展以来，还没发现有向干部部门打说情电话、递条子的。
