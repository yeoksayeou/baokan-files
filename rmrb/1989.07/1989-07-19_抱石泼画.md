The renowned Chinese painter Fu Baoshi once returned to his hometown to visit relatives. One day, he went to visit his friend Fu Guangzu. After some casual conversation, Fu Guangzu asked him to paint a picture as a memento. Fu Baoshi agreed readily. The next day, Fu Guangzu bought the cloth, ground the ink, and prepared the brushes; Fu Baoshi arrived on time as promised. After exchanging a few pleasantries, Fu Baoshi asked his friend to move the table and the cloth and ink outside. After a long time, Fu Baoshi still did not start painting but instead looked up at the sky, searching left and right. Suddenly, a majestic eagle flew by in the distance. Fu Baoshi picked up the ink slab and splashed the ink onto the white cloth, instantly leaving black stains all over it. Fu Guangzu was shocked and scolded, “Oh my, if you don’t want to paint, that’s fine, but why did you ruin this good white cloth like this!” Fu Baoshi smiled and said, “Don’t worry, don’t worry. It takes more than one hoe to dig a pond.” He put down the ink slab, picked up the brush, and started painting on the cloth, one stroke here, one stroke there. In the blink of an eye, a vivid painting of a pine tree and an eagle appeared on the white cloth. Fu Guangzu looked and saw that the pine tree was indeed the one in front of his door! The eagle? He looked up at the sky, and the eagle was still circling. Fu Guangzu suddenly realized and couldn’t help but clap his hands in admiration.

    抱石泼画
    竹间
    国画大师傅抱石早年回故乡探亲时，有一天去拜访朋友傅光族。闲谈之后，傅光族请他作一幅画，留个纪念。傅抱石欣然允诺。次日，傅光族买好布，磨好墨，备好笔；傅抱石也准时赴约。两人寒暄几句，傅抱石叫朋友把桌子和布、墨移到屋外。过了好久，傅抱石仍迟迟不动笔作画，却仰首天空左右搜寻。一会儿，远处飞来一只雄鹰，傅抱石端起墨砚就把墨汁往铺好的白竹布上一泼，顿时洁白的布上墨渍斑斑。傅光族大吃一惊责怪说：“喔哟哟，你不画不要紧，怎么把好端端的白竹布弄成这个样子！”傅抱石笑笑说：“不要慌，不要慌，一镐难挖一口塘。”他把砚台一放，提起笔在布上一笔来一笔去，一笔东一笔西。眨眼工夫，白竹布上出现了一幅栩栩如生的松鹰图。傅光族一看，这松不就是门前那棵松吗！这鹰？他抬头往天空一看，雄鹰还在盘旋。傅光族猛然醒悟过来，不禁拍手叫绝。
