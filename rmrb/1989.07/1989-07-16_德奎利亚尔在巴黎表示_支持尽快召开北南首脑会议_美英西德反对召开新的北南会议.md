UN Secretary-General Perez de Cuellar, who is in Paris to attend the 200th anniversary celebrations of the French Revolution, said today that he supports the proposal by the leaders of Senegal and three other countries to hold a summit of North-South leaders as soon as possible to discuss the global debt issue.

De Cuellar told Agence France-Presse that in the current situation of global economic crisis, the debt issue should be fully resolved as soon as possible. He also stressed that solving the debt problem requires respecting the independence of both rich and poor countries while emphasizing their unity.

The Secretary-General announced that the next session of the UN General Assembly will focus mainly on the debt issue. The UN will also hold a special conference on economic development next February. The United States, Britain, and West Germany have expressed opposition to holding a new North-South summit.
