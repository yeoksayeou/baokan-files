The Arab League Secretary-General, Shazly Khalib, has called on all warring factions in Lebanon to recognize their national responsibilities, cease hostilities, and pave the way for the Arab Three-Party Committee to assist in resolving the Lebanese issue.

Khalib emphasized that national reconciliation in Lebanon cannot be built on a foundation of hostility and violence.

The Arab Three-Party Committee, consisting of Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and Algeria, was established at the Arab Summit in Casablanca, Morocco, in May this year. It has been tasked with finding a solution to end Lebanon's 14-year civil war by November.

The foreign ministers of the three countries will meet in Rabat, Morocco, on July 29 to discuss plans to ease the current tense situation in Lebanon.

Meanwhile, reports from Lebanon indicate that since Thursday evening, Christian militias and Syrian forces have been engaged in continuous attacks on each other's bases, resulting in 13 deaths and 65 injuries. The situation in the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has become even more tense today.

    阿盟呼吁黎交战各方停火
    新华社突尼斯7月28日电　据突尼斯电台今天广播，阿拉伯联盟秘书长沙兹利·卡利比呼吁黎巴嫩交战各方认清各自肩负的民族责任，停止枪战，从而为阿拉伯三方委员会协助处置黎巴嫩问题铺平道路。
    卡利比指出，黎巴嫩的全国和解是不可能建立在各方敌对和发生暴力的基础上的。
    由摩洛哥、沙特阿拉伯和阿尔及利亚组成的阿拉伯三方委员会是今年5月在摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡举行的阿拉伯首脑会议上成立的。它接受委托在11月以前找出结束黎巴嫩14年内战的方案。
    该委员会的三方外长29日将在摩洛哥首都拉巴特会晤，商讨消除黎巴嫩现时紧张局势的计划。
    另据来自黎巴嫩的消息，自星期四晚间以来，基督教派和叙利亚武装不断互相袭击对方的营地，已有13人死亡、65人受伤。黎巴嫩首都贝鲁特的局势今天更趋紧张。
