Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 1st

The eighth session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee was held yesterday afternoon and today in groups to continue studying and discussing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the report by State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing, Chen Xitong, on behalf of the State Council, regarding the situation of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot.

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee has great historical significance

Commissioner He Ying said, after the decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, the Party Central Committee promptly convened the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. This meeting is a historic and far-reaching meeting in the history of our Party. This is mainly reflected in the following three aspects: First, the meeting quickly and smoothly resolved the serious errors of Comrade Zhao Ziyang. This is a great victory for this meeting, fully demonstrating that our Party and the Party Central Committee are powerful. Zhao Ziyang's problem is not a general problem within the Party, but a struggle related to the fate and future of the Party and the country. At a critical moment when the Party and the country were at stake, he did not stand with the Party but supported the turmoil and the split within the Party. If his proposals were followed, our Party and the socialist system would be overthrown, and a second or third-rate bourgeois satellite republic would appear on the map of China. By resolving Zhao Ziyang's problem, our Party has eliminated a major hidden danger. This is a fortunate thing for the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and a glorious achievement of this meeting. Second, the formation of the new Central Leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core is very inspiring and encouraging. This new leadership collective is an ideal one, relatively satisfactory to the older generation of revolutionaries, and trustworthy to the people. It is a collective with great aspirations and a spirit of self-improvement. This is another glorious achievement of this meeting. Third, the Public Report of the Plenum and the subsequent multiple decisions have played a role in governing the country and stabilizing the people. People see that the problem of Zhao Ziyang has been resolved, and the new leadership with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core has been formed, but the major policies of China have not changed, the foreign policy has not changed, and China will continue to advance along the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, with one central task and two basic points. This is of great significance for consolidating and developing the achievements of suppressing the riot, further stabilizing the situation, stabilizing the hearts of the Party and the people, enhancing the cohesion and centripetal force of all ethnic groups, and is generally recognized both domestically and internationally. This is another glorious achievement of the Plenum.

Commissioner Song Rucui said, Zhao Ziyang has long deviated from the four cardinal principles, indulged in and encouraged the spread of bourgeois liberalization, attacked comrades who adhere to the four cardinal principles, and promoted and appointed people who engage in bourgeois liberalization. At a critical moment when the Party and the country were in danger, he deserted and became a lackey, putting the Central Committee in a situation of being attacked from both front and rear, causing serious disasters to the Party and the country. The Central Committee's decision to revoke all his posts while continuing to investigate his problems is very necessary. It is suggested that a force should be organized to thoroughly investigate and make it public to the people, to seriously enforce Party discipline and eliminate hidden dangers.

The facts of the counter-revolutionary riot are indisputable

Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Yunnan Provincial People's Congress, Yang Yitang, who attended the meeting, said that the numerous vivid facts listed in Comrade Chen Xitong's report have indisputably proven that this is a nationwide political turmoil planned, organized, and premeditated by a very small number of people, which then developed into a counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, Beijing. Is it a turmoil or a "patriotic democratic movement"? Should martial law be imposed? The facts are now clear and clear, and there is nothing to argue about. This is indeed a heart-wrenching class struggle, a serious political struggle related to the life and death of the Party and the People's Republic. The faces of those who plotted behind the scenes have been fully exposed. They stubbornly insist on promoting bourgeois liberalization, collude with foreign reactionary forces, and leak the core secrets of the Central Committee to illegal organizations. They use young and innocent students to make the solemn Tiananmen Square look unpresentable and turn the once peaceful capital into a place of fighting, looting, arson, and killing. Isn't this an attempt to overthrow the Communist Party and subvert the People's Republic of China? They are the most vicious enemies, they are guilty, they are traitors to the Republic, and they are traitors to the Communist Party. They must be investigated to the end. Zhao Ziyang's problem should also be investigated in connection with their problems. Of course, we must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and implement the policy of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist.

Firmly oppose bourgeois liberalization

Commissioner Xie Tielei said, in recent years, there have been many things that have confused people. When Comrade Xiaoping emphasized the four upholds or proposed the slogan of opposing bourgeois liberalization, someone within the Party quickly came out to "reduce the temperature" and change the direction. On our ideological front, various bourgeois ideologies and isms can be widely propagated, advocating "if you don't seek for yourself, you will be punished by heaven and earth," shouting "long live private ownership"; but propagating communist ideology, propagating selflessness and hard work, will be ridiculed and resisted. They completely deny the Chinese traditional culture of several thousand years, deny the struggle of the Chinese people from the Opium War to the present, deny the People's Liberation War led by the Communist Party of China, advocate "accepting invasion," and believe that if they do not resist the invasion of the United States and Japan, China might have been rich today. This is a thorough and through traitor philosophy and nationalism. In the literary and film circles, bourgeois ideology is also rampant, everything is money-oriented, only economic benefits are pursued, and social benefits are not pursued. Unhealthy and even reactionary fighting, killing, and pornographic films are temporarily flooding the market. Even some compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao, and overseas Chinese find it unbearable, thinking that we have gone too far and are too close to Western decadent culture. For such bad phenomena, no one can criticize, once criticized, it is said to be "ideological rigidity" and hinder "creative freedom." Why in our socialist country, allow the freedom to propagate bourgeois ideology, but restrict the freedom to propagate Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought? After suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and convening the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the truth has finally been revealed. I firmly believe that the new core leadership of the Party Central Committee will continue to implement the Party's consistent policy towards intellectuals, respect knowledge, and cherish talents; in literary work, will continue to implement the "two for" direction and the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy, fully mobilize the socialist initiative of literary and artistic workers. However, for those who insist on errors and continue to engage in bourgeois liberalization, serious criticism and struggle should be conducted.

Seriously summarize the lessons of this riot

Commissioner Cao Longhao said, this time in Beijing, the beginning was a student movement and turmoil, and then a counter-revolutionary riot. From the perspective of reflection, there are many lessons worth seriously summarizing. Comrade Xiaoping said that this turmoil would come sooner or later. Why did a counter-revolutionary riot occur in our great socialist motherland's capital after 40 years of socialist revolution and construction? I think, in addition to the international background and domestic social roots, from our work, the lessons are: (1) Since the focus on economic construction and reform and opening up, the whole Party has indeed neglected the ideological education work of adhering to the four cardinal principles, from the central to the local, there is a universal problem, that is, not talking about the four cardinal principles, especially not talking about class struggle. Building socialism, not talking about political direction, not talking about the dictatorship of the proletariat, not talking about Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, makes people lack the necessary spiritual pillar, and the Party appears "money worship." This is inseparable from the leadership errors of the Central Leadership, especially Comrade Zhao Ziyang. (2) In the reform of the economic system, how to closely combine it with the reform of the political system. We have not handled the phenomenon of serious decoupling between the reform of the economic system and the reform of the political system well. Now our political system is not progressing but regressing. For example, various institutions are becoming more and more bloated. The role of the Party's leadership and political and ideological work is also not properly positioned. In addition, in the process of various theoretical discussions, various thoughts are very active, but our positive guidance is not keeping up, making people's thoughts quite confused, so in the face of political turmoil, some people cannot withstand the test and cannot distinguish right from wrong. (3) From this riot, we deeply realize that in the future, how to strengthen the rule of law, and how to strengthen the rule of law education from cadres to the masses, is a major issue. This time, the student movement in many places is seriously illegal, why not handle it according to law. The fundamental problem is the weak awareness of the rule of law. In the future, we must take effective measures to strengthen the rule of law education for the whole Party and the people, and strive to achieve the rule of law. (4) Beijing has won the victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, but we must not relax the punishment of officials' corruption and corruption, and overcome the negative phenomena within the Party and the government. The harm caused by officials' corruption and corruption is serious, we cannot relax, we must grasp it to the end. We should start from the central state organs, once the top is cut, the work below will be easier to do.

Commissioner Pingcuo Wangjie said, in the past few years, we have indeed relaxed ideological and political work, relaxed the struggle to adhere to the four cardinal principles, resulting in the spread of bourgeois liberalization and the formation of a reactionary political climate for this turmoil. This lesson is particularly profound. Due to the spread of bourgeois liberalization, in the previous period, works and publications that insulted ethnic minorities appeared one after another, seriously affecting national unity. The "Xing Fengsu" incident that occurred simultaneously with the Beijing turmoil and affected many regions across the country is a prominent example. If it were not for the decisive and resolute measures taken by the Central Committee and relevant provinces and cities, and the extensive guidance work done, it might have developed into social turmoil and ethnic conflicts. Here, there is a need to strengthen the education of Marxism-Leninism on national issues and the Party's national policies among all ethnic groups across the country.

Determined to correct mistakes

Commissioner Qu Tangliang said, the experience and lessons of this incident are profound, and we must be determined to correct mistakes and errors. Comrade Xiaoping repeatedly said that we must gain the trust of the people. This requires taking actual actions and seriously solving some problems. So many people were involved in this incident, not because they were dissatisfied with the lack of democracy, but because problems such as corruption have not been solved. Punishing corruption, actions must be fast, and key cases must be handled. Leaders must set an example. Now we can confidently carry out the education of the four cardinal principles from an earlier period, starting from primary school, so that it can be deeply rooted in people's hearts. We must also strengthen patriotic education and education on hard work and self-reliance. In terms of improving the legal system, we must not only formulate economic regulations but also accelerate the formulation of political regulations, such as regulations on associations and registration of people's organizations, and the Civil Servant Law should also be formulated, and it should be stipulated that government officials are not allowed to participate in political marches or anti-government activities.

Commissioner Yuan Xuefen said, Comrade Xiaoping said that the arrival of this turmoil is determined by the international climate and the domestic climate. I think, it takes three feet of ice to freeze. I remember during the Fifth and Sixth National People's Congress Standing Committee, I once loudly called out in the meeting that only focusing on economic construction and not on ideological and cultural construction would be punished. It is precisely because we ourselves have abandoned the position, allowing liberalism and anarchism to spread like a plague. This bloody lesson is how profound! Two general secretaries of the Party did not grasp ideological construction, which is a big joke and a historical tragedy! The international climate is the objective condition of the existence of those who want to destroy us, but the subjective factor of the small climate that the Communist Party forgets to transform is also very important, and this tragedy must be remembered forever. This time, so many people were involved, wasn't it because of the slogans of overthrowing officials and severely punishing corruption? In the past, we only heard the slogan of thunder without rain, and the punishment of corruption was not effective. In the future, we must seriously grasp this problem, starting from the central leadership, and check ourselves and our children and relatives. If we cannot correct ourselves, how can we correct others!

Corruption must be eliminated to gain the trust of the people

Commissioner Zhang Youjun said, why did so many people get involved in the beginning of this student movement? One of the reasons is that our Party and government have made mistakes, and the people are dissatisfied. That is to say, our mistakes have been utilized by bad people, and our Party indeed has such problems. If we do not actually improve these mistakes, eliminate the phenomenon of officials' corruption, we cannot gain the trust of the people, and mobilize the broad masses of the people to further smoothly carry out the Four Modernizations. The reason why we have not done a good job in eliminating the phenomenon of corruption in the past is that, as Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, it may be because a group of high-level cadres' children have been involved. In the future, we must take effective measures to solve this problem. Bourgeois liberalization, social bad tendencies, and official corruption have a great impact on students, and students do not believe in the political courses we teach. Without eliminating corruption and paying attention to ideological education, we will lose our direction.

Commissioner Pan Yan said, what the people hope to do and urgently care about is to rectify officials' corruption and corruption. We should start from Beijing, and once Beijing is rectified, the rest will follow. This problem requires great determination. Corruption and corruption are the easiest to lose the hearts of the people. I think the new central leadership will do a good job. The use of cadres should be fair. We should appoint cadres who are both virtuous and talented, and not use those who blow their own horns and flatter others.

Commissioner Ding Guangxun said, Comrade Deng Xiaoping emphasized that the opposition to corruption should not be lenient, and we must do practical things. The banner of opposing corruption should not be allowed to be held by others. I hope that our news media, in addition to introducing the propaganda of suppressing the riot, will also propagate that the Party and the government are vigorously opposing corruption. In this way, people will be satisfied and supportive.

Commissioner Ma Wanqi said, this meeting listened to the relevant documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the report made by State Councilor Chen Xitong on behalf of the State Council to the meeting. After learning and discussing, I have a deep understanding of the current domestic situation, and cleared up many worries. Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have always been concerned about and loved the motherland. This time, the event that started from the student movement and led to the riot, most of the masses did not understand the truth and had some misunderstandings, which is understandable. As for me, it was not until June 9th that Chairman Deng Xiaoping spoke publicly that I had a clearer understanding of the true situation of this incident. We originally hoped that the matter could be resolved satisfactorily and avoid national losses, and we also hoped to find some ways to coordinate and solve the problem. After in-depth learning and discussion, we have understood the serious nature of this incident. Fortunately, the incident has now been suppressed. The Fourth Plenary Session proposed to continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and to continue to resolutely implement the basic line of one central task and two basic points determined by the Thirteenth National Congress of the Party. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of the country and must be adhered to unswervingly and consistently. Reform and opening up is the road to strengthening the country and must be firmly and consistently implemented, and will not return to the old path of closing the door to the outside world. At present, we must especially focus on four major tasks, which are completely in line with China's national conditions and the common aspirations of all ethnic groups in the country. I, like everyone else, am pleased with the achievements of the Fourth Plenary Session and express my heartfelt support, and I am full of confidence in China's socialist modernization. The most important issue at present is to quickly restore the normal order of society. Only stability can promote the development of production, transportation, trade, tourism, and other undertakings, and develop China's economy, culture, science, and education.

Hong Kong and Macao, whether historically, geographically, or in terms of the composition of residents, are closely related to the motherland. Only when the motherland is strong, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots will have a position, and only when the motherland is prosperous and thriving, the economy of Hong Kong and Macao can develop. What Hong Kong and Macao compatriots expect is the prosperity and strength of the motherland. Therefore, it is hoped that in dealing with such incidents, the two types of different contradictions should be strictly distinguished, and the scope of strikes should be minimized and the scope of unity should be expanded to help stabilize the overall situation as soon as possible.

Strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions

Commissioner Hao Yipu said, the counter-revolutionary riot has been suppressed, and Comrade Xiaoping said that we must strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions. The vast majority of students are patriotic, but they do not know how to be patriotic and are influenced by Western bourgeois ideology. We should help young students more. We should correctly carry forward the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speech. For the majority of students who are not bad leaders, we should mainly carry out positive education. The construction of spiritual civilization should be long-term and persistent, and the education of young students should be closely combined with normal education, especially with basic education.

Further strengthen and improve the work of the People's Congress

Deputy Director of the Standing Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Congress, Butegesi, who attended the meeting, said that the People's Congress should firmly uphold the four cardinal principles. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of our country. Our legislative, supervisory, and decision-making on major issues must be further upheld. Guided by this ideological line, we must further uphold socialist democracy and the rule of law, improve and perfect the legal system, and must further uphold and improve the fundamental system of the People's Congress. A few people, on the one hand, act lawlessly and trample on the Constitution and laws, and on the other hand, plot to further sabotage socialist democracy and the rule of law to achieve their evil purposes. This should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with.

Commissioner Wang Wei said, in this turmoil and riot, the fundamental system of the People's Congress has become an important part of the political struggle. We must summarize experience, carry forward achievements, overcome shortcomings, solve problems, unite the people, and continue to advance. I think, at least there are the following four points: (1) The system of the People's Congress is beneficial to the people's power led by our Party to implement the three-step strategic deployment in a stable political environment, implement one central task and two basic points, and make the socialist cause develop steadily and solidly. (2) The practice of the Constitution and laws has proven that it has achieved good social effects in consolidating and developing socialism, uniting the people, fighting against the enemy, and adhering to one central task and two basic points. (3) The People's Congress has broad representativeness, and the political enthusiasm of the representatives is high. (4) Problems are solved relatively quickly, without being dragged on. This is determined by the characteristic that the government's interests are consistent with the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people. In short, the system of the People's Congress has played an active role in building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and it is suitable for China's national conditions. However, in legislation and supervision, there are still many problems and much work to be done. The people are urgently demanding that the Standing Committee of the People's Congress improve its work. Some people advocate parliamentary democracy and pluralism, which can only cause chaos and disrupt the stability and unity of society, obstructing the construction of socialism and reform. Of course, we must admit that we still have many shortcomings and problems. But these are problems that need to be gradually improved in an orderly manner, not fundamentally changing our system of the People's Congress. The problems of anti-corruption, promoting democracy, etc., raised by young students and the masses this time, are mostly problems that the people's representatives have raised many times, but have not been paid attention to. We should respect the opinions of the people's representatives, fully reflect the opinions of the people's representatives, and supervise the relevant departments to seriously implement the resolutions of the People's Congress and all the correct opinions of the people's representatives. Only in this way can the political role of the people's representatives be displayed. We should quickly formulate supervision procedures, strengthen supervision, especially pay attention to the supervision of the government's implementation of the Constitution, to improve the quality of the work of the People's Congress. We should strengthen legislation, especially legislation on reform and opening up, legislation against bourgeois liberalization, and legislation to safeguard the rights of the people. We should ensure quality and speed up the process. We should respond to Comrade Xiaoping's call, do a few things that satisfy the people, achieve results, and gain the trust of the people. In short, we should continue to give full play to the advantages of the People's Congress and do a good job in all aspects of work.

    认真总结教训　努力改进工作
    全国人大常委会分组讨论四中全会精神和陈希同报告
    新华社北京7月1日电　七届全国人大常委会第八次会议昨天下午和今天连续举行分组会，继续学习讨论党的十三届四中全会精神，讨论国务委员、北京市市长陈希同受国务院委托所作的关于制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱情况的报告。
    十三届四中全会有重大历史意义
    何英委员说，在平息反革命暴乱取得决定性的胜利之后，党中央及时地召开了十三届中央委员会第四次全体会议。这次会议是我党历史上一次具有重大历史意义和深远影响的会议。主要表现在：第一，会议迅速而顺利地解决了赵紫阳同志的严重错误问题，这是这次会议的一个很大的胜利，充分说明我们的党和党中央这个集体是强有力的。赵紫阳同志的问题不是党内一般性的问题，同他的斗争是关系党和国家命运前途的斗争。他在党和国家处于生死存亡的关键时刻，不同党站在一起，而是支持动乱和分裂党。如按照他的主张行事，我们的党和社会主义制度将被颠覆，一个二三流的资产阶级附庸共和国将在中国的版图上出现。处理了赵紫阳同志的问题，使我们党消除了一大隐患。这是全党全国人民值得庆幸的，是这次会议一个光辉的成就。第二，以江泽民总书记为核心的新的中央领导集体的形成是很鼓舞人心、鼓舞士气的。这个新的领导集体是一个比较理想、老一代革命家比较满意、人民群众可以信赖，是大有作为、有奋发图强精神的集体。这是这次会议另一个光辉的成就。第三，全会公报和会后的多项决定，起到了治国安民的作用，人们看到赵紫阳同志的问题解决了，以江泽民同志为核心的新领导集体形成了，但中国的大政方针不变，对外政策不变，中国将继续沿着十一届三中全会的路线、一个中心两个基本点前进。这对巩固和发展平息暴乱的成果，进一步稳定形势，安定党心、民心，增强各族人民的向心力和凝聚力，均具有重大意义。国内外也普遍认为中国的大局已定。这是全会的另一个光辉成就。
    宋汝棼委员说，赵紫阳同志背离四项基本原则，纵容和助长资产阶级自由化的泛滥，打击坚持四项基本原则的同志，重用提拔搞资产阶级自由化的人，由来已久。在党和国家处于危难的关头，他临阵倒戈，为虎作伥，置中央于腹背受敌之地，给党和国家造成严重灾难。中央决定在撤销他的一切职务的同时，对他的问题继续进行审查，是十分必要的，建议一定要组织力量彻底清查，公之于众，以严肃党纪，杜绝后患。
    反革命暴乱的事实无可辩驳
    列席会议的云南省人大常委会副主任杨一堂说，陈希同同志报告中列举的大量活生生的事实已无可辩驳地证明这是一场极少数人策划的有计划、有组织、有预谋的全国性的政治动乱，进而在首都北京发展成反革命暴乱。是动乱还是“爱国民主运动”？是否应当采取戒严的措施？事实已经清清楚楚、明明白白地摆在那里，没有什么可争论的了。这确实是一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争，是关系到党和人民共和国生死存亡的严重政治斗争。那些在幕后策划者的嘴脸已经暴露无遗，他们顽固坚持搞资产阶级自由化，与国外反动势力相勾结，把中央的核心机密捅给非法组织的人。他们利用年轻善良的学生把庄严的天安门广场搞得不像样子，把个好端端的首都搞成打、砸、抢、烧、杀的场所。这难道还不是要推翻共产党、颠覆中华人民共和国吗？他们是最险恶的敌人，他们有罪，他们是共和国的罪人，是共产党的叛逆。对他们要追查到底。对赵紫阳的问题也要和这些人的问题联系起来审查清楚。当然要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，实行坦白从宽，抗拒从严的政策。
    坚决反对资产阶级自由化
    谢铁骊委员说，这几年，常常有些事情使人迷惑不解。当小平同志强调四个坚持或提出反对资产阶级自由化的口号时，党内很快就有人出来“降温”，转移方向。在我们的思想阵地上，可以大肆宣传资产阶级的多种思潮、各种主义，鼓吹“人不为己，天诛地灭”，高喊“私有制万岁”；但宣传共产主义思想，宣传大公无私、艰苦奋斗，却要遭到嘲弄和抵制。他们全盘否定几千年来的中国传统文化，否定鸦片战争以来的中国人民前赴后继的斗争，否定中国共产党领导的人民解放战争，主张“接受侵略”，认为若不抵抗美国、日本的侵略，中国今天也许已经富裕起来了。这真是彻头彻尾的汉奸哲学、卖国主义。在文艺界、电影界，也同样是资产阶级思潮泛滥，一切向钱看，只抓经济效益，不抓社会效益，内容不健康的、甚至是反动的打斗片、凶杀片、黄色片，一时充斥市场，连一些台、港、澳同胞，海外侨胞，都看不惯，认为我们走得太远了，太靠近西方的腐朽文化了。对这种不良现象，谁也批评不得，一批评，就说是“思想僵化”，妨碍“创作自由”。为什么在我们社会主义国家里，允许宣传资产阶级思潮的自由，倒限制宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想的自由呢？经过这次平息反革命暴乱，经过党的十三届四中全会的召开，真相终于大白了。我坚信党中央新的领导核心，会继续实行党对知识分子的一贯政策，尊重知识，爱护人才；在文艺工作中，会继续贯彻“二为”方向和“双百”方针，充分调动文艺工作者的社会主义积极性。但是，对于那些坚持错误、继续搞资产阶级自由化的人，应进行严肃的批评和斗争。
    认真总结这次暴乱的教训
    曹龙浩委员说，这次北京发生的开始是学潮、动乱，直至反革命暴乱，我们从反思的角度有很多教训值得认真地总结。小平同志讲这场风波迟早要来，为什么在社会主义革命和建设40年后的今天，在我们伟大的社会主义祖国的首都发生反革命暴乱呢？我认为，除有国际的背景和国内的社会根源外，从我们工作中检查起来，其教训是：（1）以经济建设为中心，改革开放以来，全党的的确确忽视了坚持四项基本原则的思想教育工作，从中央到地方带有一个普遍的问题，是不讲四项基本原则，特别是不讲阶级斗争。建设社会主义，不讲政治方向，不讲无产阶级专政，不讲马克思主义、毛泽东思想，使人们缺乏应有的精神支柱，党出现“拜金”主义。这是与中央领导，特别是赵紫阳的领导错误分不开的。（2）在经济体制改革中，怎样与政治体制改革紧密结合。我们没有处理好经济体制改革与政治体制改革严重脱节的现象。现在我们的政治体制不是前进，而是倒退了。例如，目前各种机构越来越庞大。党的领导作用、政治思想工作的地位也摆不正，加上进行各项理论研讨中，各种思想很活跃，但我们的正面引导跟不上，使人们的思想比较混乱，所以在出现政治动乱面前，一些人经不起考验，分不清大是大非。（3）从这次暴乱中我们深深认识到，今后如何加强法制，从干部到群众如何加强法制教育，是一个大课题。这次闹学潮，好多地方是严重违法的，为什么不依法办事。根本的问题是法制观念淡薄。今后必须采取有力措施，对全党和全民加强守法教育，努力做到有法必依，执法必严，做到依法治国。（4）北京平息反革命暴乱取得了胜利，但决不能放松惩治官倒和腐败，克服党和政府中的消极现象。官倒和腐败给我们带来的危害是严重的，我们不能放松，要抓到底。要从中央国家机关开始，上面开了刀，下面的工作就好作了。
    平措汪杰委员说，在过去几年中，我们确实放松了思想政治工作，放松了坚持四项基本原则的斗争，以致于资产阶级自由化泛滥，形成了这次动乱的反动的政治气候。这个教训尤为深刻。由于资产阶级自由化泛滥，前一时期侮辱少数民族的文艺作品和出版物接连不断，严重影响了民族团结。与北京的动乱同期出现的波及全国许多地区的“《性风俗》事件”就是突出的例子，若不是中央和有关省市采取了坚决果断的处理措施，做了大量疏导工作，很可能发展成为社会动乱和民族冲突。这里就有一个要在全国各族人民中加强马列主义民族观和党的民族政策教育的问题。
    痛下决心纠正失误
    区棠亮委员说，这次事件的经验教训是深刻的，确实要痛下决心纠正错误、失误。小平同志一再讲要取信于民。这要采取实际行动，认真解决一些问题。那么多的人卷入这次事件，就是因为不满意腐败等问题没有得到解决，而不是什么争取民主。惩治腐败，行动要快，要抓要案，领导要做表率。现在比过去一个时期可以理直气壮地进行四项基本原则教育，要从小学抓起，使它深入人心。还要加强爱国主义教育、艰苦奋斗的教育。在健全法制方面，不仅要制定经济法规，还要加快政治法规的制定，如有关结社、人民团体登记的法规，公务员法也要制定，应规定政府工作人员不得参加政治游行或反政府的活动。
    袁雪芬委员说，小平同志讲这场风波的到来是由国际上的大气候和国内的小气候决定的。我认为，冰冻三尺决非一日之寒。记得在五、六届人大常委会期间，我曾在会上大声疾呼，光抓经济建设，不抓思想文化建设是要受惩罚的。正因为我们自己放弃了阵地，让自由主义、无政府主义泛滥成灾。这个血的教训何等深刻！两届党的总书记都不抓思想建设，真是天大的笑话、历史的悲剧！大气候是亡我之心不死的客观条件的存在，但共产党人忘记改造主观世界为主要内因的小气候也很重要，这个悲剧要永远记取。这次所以有如此众多的人被卷入，还不是被打倒官倒、严惩腐败的口号激起来的吗？过去只听到雷声大雨点小的口号，惩治腐败不力，今后应认认真真抓一抓这个问题，从中央领导开始，自身查一查子女亲属的问题，如果不能正己，如何正人呢！！
    不消除腐败不能取信于民
    张有隽委员说，这次学潮开始为什么这么多群众都卷进去了，原因之一就是我们党和政府有失误，群众不满。就是说我们的失误被坏人利用，而我们党确实存在这样一些问题，不切实改进这些失误，清除官倒，消除腐败现象，我们就不能取信于民，动员广大人民进一步顺利进行四个现代化建设。我们清除腐败现象过去之所以搞得不好，正如邓小平同志所指出的，可能是由于我们有一批高级干部子弟陷进去了，今后一定要采取有效措施加以解决。资产阶级自由化、社会不良风气、官员腐败给学生产生极大影响，学生不相信我们讲的政治课。不消除腐败，不重视思想教育，我们就会迷失方向。
    潘焱委员说，人民希望办的事，急迫关心的是整官倒，整腐败。要从北京整起，北京整好了，下面就会跟着搞好。这个问题要下大决心。贪污、腐败最容易失去民心。我想中央新的领导班子一定会搞好。使用干部要公道。要起用德才兼备的干部，不要用那些吹牛拍马的干部。
    丁光训委员说，邓小平同志强调，反对腐败决不要心慈手软，要做出实事来。反腐败旗帜不要让别人去高举。我希望，我们的新闻媒介在介绍反暴乱宣传之外，要宣传党和政府正在大力反腐败。这样人们会满意、拥护。
    邓小平同志的讲话消除了港澳同胞的疑虑马万祺委员说，这次会议听取了中国共产党十三届四中全会的有关文件和陈希同国务委员代表国务院向大会所作的报告。经过学习和讨论，使我对当前国内的基本情况有深刻的认识，澄清了不少忧虑。港澳同胞历来关心祖国、热爱祖国。此次国内从学潮而引致暴乱的事件，大部分群众多未明真相，很不理解，产生了某些误会是可以理解的。就我个人来说，对此次事件的真实情况也是到6月9日邓小平主席公开讲了话才较为清楚。我们本来希望事情能够得到圆满解决，避免国家遭受损失，也曾希望通过一些办法来协调解决问题。经过深入学习和讨论，我们才了解到这次事件的严重性质。目前事件幸已平息。四中全会提出要继续坚决执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线方针和政策，继续坚决执行党的十三大确定的一个中心两个基本点的基本路线。四项基本原则是立国之本，必须毫不动摇始终一贯地加以坚持。改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。当前要特别抓好四件大事，这是完全符合我国国情的，是全国各族人民的共同愿望。我和大家一样，对四中全会的成就感到欣慰和表示衷心拥护，对我国进行社会主义四个现代化充满信心。而当前最重要的问题是需要迅速把社会的秩序恢复正常。只有稳定才能将生产、运输、贸易、旅游等事业搞上去，把我国的经济、文化、科学、教育等发展起来。
    港澳两地无论从历史上地理上居民成份上和祖国都息息相关，只有祖国的强大，港澳同胞才有地位，只有祖国繁荣兴盛，港澳经济方能发展起来。港澳同胞所盼望的是祖国的繁荣富强。因而希望在处理此次性质的事件中要严格区分两类不同矛盾，尽量缩小打击面和扩大团结范围，以利于早日稳定大局。
    严格区分两类不同性质矛盾
    郝诒纯委员说，反革命暴乱被平息了，小平同志讲要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。绝大多数学生是爱国的，但不知道应该怎么爱，受了西方资产阶级思想的影响，我们对青年学生应该多帮助。要把小平同志的讲话精神正确贯彻下去。对多数并非坏头头的学生要以正面教育为主。精神文明建设应该细水长流，对青年学生教育要与正常教育、尤其是与基础教育密切结合进行。
    进一步加强和改进人大工作
    列席会议的内蒙古自治区人大常委会副主任布特格其说，人大要旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则。四项基本原则是我们的立国之本，我们的立法、监督、决定重大事项等工作，都必须进一步坚持。以此为指导思想，必须进一步坚持社会主义民主与法制，健全和完善法律制度，必须进一步坚持和完善人民代表大会这一根本制度。极少数人一面无法无天，践踏宪法和法律，一面阴谋进一步破坏社会主义民主与法制，企图达到他们的罪恶目的，对此，应彻底查处。
    王伟委员说，在这次动乱、暴乱过程中，人民代表大会这一根本制度，成为政治斗争的重要内容之一。我们必须总结经验，发扬成绩，克服缺点，解决问题，团结人民，继续前进。我认为，至少有以下四点：（一）人民代表大会制度有利于我们党领导下的人民政权，在稳定的政治环境中，实施三大步的战略部署，实施一个中心两个基本点，使社会主义事业稳定地巩固地向前发展。（二）宪法和法律的实践证明，它在巩固和发展社会主义过程中，在团结人民，打击敌人方面，在坚持一个中心，两个基本点方面，取得好的社会效益。（三）人民代表大会，有广泛的代表性，代表们的政治积极性是高的。（四）解决问题比较快，没有牵扯。这是由于政府同广大人民根本利益一致这一特性所决定的。总之，人民代表大会制度在建设有中国特色的社会主义过程中发挥了积极作用，它适合中国的国情。但是，在立法和实施监督等方面，还有不少问题，还有许多工作要做。人民是迫切要求人大常委改进工作的。有人鼓吹议会民主，搞多元化，那只能闹个乱哄哄，破坏安定团结，阻碍社会主义建设和改革的进行。当然，我们一定要承认我们还有许多缺点和问题。但那是要有领导有秩序逐步去完善的问题，而不是根本改变我们人民代表大会制度。这次青年学生和群众中提出的反腐败、促进民主等问题，大都是人民代表多次提过的问题，但没被重视起来。要尊重人民代表的意见，要全面反映人民代表意见，监督有关部门认真执行人大决议和人民代表的一切正确意见。只有这样，人民代表的政治作用才能显示出来。要迅速制定监督程序，加强监督，特别注意对政府执行宪法方面的监督，以提高人大工作质量。要加强立法，特别是关于改革开放的立法、反对资产阶级自由化的立法、保障人民权利的立法。要保证质量，加快进行。我们要响应小平同志的号召，要做几件使人民满意的事情，干出实绩，取信于民。总之，我们要继续发挥人大的优势，做好各项工作。
