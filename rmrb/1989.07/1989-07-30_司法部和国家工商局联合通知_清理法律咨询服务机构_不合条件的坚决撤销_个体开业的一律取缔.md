The Ministry of Justice and the State Administration for Industry and Commerce recently issued a joint notice addressing the current situation where many places have numerous legal service agencies with chaotic market order. The notice clearly stipulates the conditions for establishing legal consultation service agencies, their scope of business, approval, and registration procedures, and will conduct a comprehensive cleanup and rectification of the legal service market in the near future.

In recent times, some local government departments, law enforcement agencies, and other units and individuals have established commercial legal service agencies without approval from the judicial administrative departments. These agencies are attached to various functional departments, and their staff, except for a few retired and seconded personnel, are mainly full-time staff from the sponsoring units. They charge fees arbitrarily, handle various legal matters indiscriminately, and provide incorrect legal advice, damaging the Party and government's prestige among the people and disrupting legal order.

The _Notice_ specifically proposes the following opinions for cleanup and rectification: Those that do not meet the establishment conditions will be resolutely revoked, and individual legal service agencies will be completely shut down; those that meet the establishment conditions will be re-approved and registered by the judicial administrative and industrial and commercial administrative departments; the names of legal consultation service agencies should be strictly limited within the prescribed scope. Names such as "debt collection companies" and "legal affairs offices" should be changed.

    司法部和国家工商局联合通知
    清理法律咨询服务机构
    不合条件的坚决撤销　个体开业的一律取缔
    本报北京7月30日讯　针对当前不少地方法律服务机构名目繁多、法律服务市场秩序混乱的状况，司法部、国家工商行政管理局近日联合发出通知，对法律咨询服务机构的成立条件、业务范围、审批及登记等事项作出明确规定，并于近期对法律服务市场进行一次全面的清理整顿。
    一个时期以来，一些地方的政府部门、执法机关及其他单位和个人不经司法行政部门批准，自行成立了营业性的法律服务机构。这些机构依附于各职能部门，从业人员中除少数为离退休干部和停薪留职人员外，其余均由主办单位在职干部兼任。他们有的乱收费，任意办理各种法律事务，错误解答法律问题，损害了党和政府在人民群众中的威信，妨碍了法律秩序。
    《通知》具体提出了清理整顿的意见：凡不符合成立条件的，坚决予以撤销，个体开业的法律服务机构一律予以取缔；凡符合成立条件的，由司法行政机关和工商行政管理机关重新办理审批、登记手续；法律咨询服务机构的名称应严格限制在规定范围内，对于“讨债公司”、“法律事务所”等名称，应予变更。
