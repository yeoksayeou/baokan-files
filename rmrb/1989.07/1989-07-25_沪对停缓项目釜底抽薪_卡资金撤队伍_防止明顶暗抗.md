	Shanghai is taking decisive steps to halt and delay construction projects by cutting off supplies and funds, and withdrawing construction teams to prevent open resistance and covert defiance.

	The Shanghai municipal government announced today at a citywide meeting to reduce construction scale and withdraw construction teams that "for construction projects listed for halt and delay, supplies and funds will be immediately stopped, and construction teams will be withdrawn to firmly bring down the high construction scale."

	Since last year, Shanghai has decided to halt or delay 1,612 projects and reduce investment by 510 million yuan. However, some units have openly resisted and covertly defied these decisions in their implementation.

    沪对停缓项目釜底抽薪
    卡资金撤队伍　防止明顶暗抗
    新华社上海7月25日电　（通讯员沈志芳、记者季进成）“对列入停缓建的建设项目，立即停止供料、供资金，并撤走施工队伍，坚决把居高不下的建设规模压下来。”这是上海市政府负责人在今天召开的全市压缩基建规模、清退施工队伍大会上宣布的。
    去年下半年以来，上海市先后决定停缓建1612项工程，压缩投资51亿元。但部分单位在执行中明顶暗抗。
