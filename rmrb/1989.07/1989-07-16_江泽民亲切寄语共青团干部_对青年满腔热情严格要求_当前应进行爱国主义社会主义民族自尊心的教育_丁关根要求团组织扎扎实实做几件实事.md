Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 16th.

Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, and Ding Guanggen, a member of the Politburo and Secretary of the Secretariat, met with all the representatives attending the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai this afternoon and had a cordial discussion with them.

Jiang Zemin said that over the past two months, during the struggle against turmoil and the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, the various levels of the Youth League organizations, as assistants to the Party, have undergone a severe test and tempering. The storm reveals the strong grass, and the fire tests the true gold. Generally speaking, the majority of the Youth League cadres working on the front line have done a lot of work and should be fully affirmed.

Jiang Zemin said that every Party organization, Youth League organization, Party member, Youth League member, and state cadre should reflect deeply on this struggle. There are many experiences and lessons worth summarizing. Our Party and Youth League organizations at all levels must, after this struggle, firmly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization.

He said that we should have full enthusiasm and strict requirements for our young generation. They are the future of the country. Currently, we should educate the young generation on patriotism, socialism, and national self-respect. We should conduct ideological education on worldview and communism for Party members and Youth League members. We should be targeted and prescriptive, so that they understand the national conditions. The whole society should care about youth work and the growth of young people.

Ding Guanggen, in his speech, fully affirmed the active role played by the Youth League organizations in this struggle. He said that the work of the Youth League is first to enhance its attractiveness and second to improve the political quality of Youth League members and young people. The various levels of the Youth League organizations should do a few solid things to win the trust of the Youth League members and young people. He hoped that the Youth League organizations would seriously reflect on the past, explore the future, and carry out youth work in a more targeted manner.

At the beginning of the discussion, Song Defu, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, reported on the situation of the enlarged meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, the current focus of youth work, and the tasks of the Youth League work in the future. He said that Jiang Zemin, as the General Secretary, had a short time to discuss with Ding Guanggen and the Youth League cadres, which showed the attention and concern of the central leadership for the work of the Youth League and the healthy growth of the young generation. It also greatly encouraged the broad masses of Youth League cadres working on the front line.

During the discussion, some responsible comrades from the Youth League organizations of provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, and the People's Liberation Army, such as Huang Yuejin, Qiang Wei, Luo Baoming, Pu Changcheng, Xu Changzhong, Wang Rulin, Mao Lingsheng, Luosang Jiangcun, Ding Yaomin, Liu Peng, Chen Qixian, and Bai Hetiyale, successively spoke. They reflected the current ideological state of young people, the problems existing in youth work, and hoped that the Party organizations would pay more attention to and care about the work of the Youth League in the future. They expressed that they would seriously summarize the experiences and lessons from this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, better play the role of the Party's assistant, actively carry out ideological education for young people, closely unite the broad masses of Youth League members and young people around the Party, and play a role in the Party's cause and the construction of the country.
