The second enlarged meeting of the 10th Central Committee of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party was held in Beijing from July 8 to 11.

The meeting pointed out that the 60-year history of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party, filled with hardships and progress, clearly shows that "without the Communist Party, there would be no new China"; "only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China." These are irrefutable truths. The Four Cardinal Principles are not only the foundation of the state but also the foundation of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party. They must be adhered to without wavering and consistently.

The meeting required that all levels of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party organizations must seriously study the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, unify their thoughts with the spirit of the plenary session and Deng Xiaoping's speech. They must strengthen ideological and political work to promote the construction of the party. They must carry out education on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization; grasp the education of independence and self-reliance, hard work and self-improvement; and conduct education on patriotism, socialism, democracy, and the rule of law. All levels of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party organizations and the broad membership must actively participate in the rectification, regulation, and deepening of reforms, continuing to play their roles in political consultation and democratic supervision.

The meeting adopted the "Resolution of the Second Enlarged Meeting of the 10th Central Committee of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party."

Lu Jiaxi, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League of China and China Zhi Gong Party, presided over the meeting. Vice-Chairmen Fang Rongxin, Yao Jun, Zhang Shiming, Tian Guangtao, Yang Lieyu, Guang Renhong, Jian Tiancong, Chen Huozhu, Chairman of the Central Advisory and Supervisory Committee Shen Qizhen, and Vice-Chairman Guo Xiuyi attended the meeting.
