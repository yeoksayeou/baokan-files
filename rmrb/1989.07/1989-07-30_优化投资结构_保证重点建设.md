Since the founding of the People's Republic, under the Party's leadership, the nation has adhered to the principle of "hard work and thrift in building the country." The state has concentrated the necessary financial and material resources to complete many key projects, laying the foundation for China's industrialization. After 40 years of effort, although China's economy is still relatively backward, the country has basically established a relatively complete national economic system. Especially in the past 10 years of reform and opening up, China has achieved significant progress, which is evident to all. In the future, we must continue to advance on this basis and must firmly implement the strategic guidelines for China's economic development proposed by the Twelfth Party Congress and reiterated by the Thirteenth Party Congress, focusing on key projects.

However, from the actual implementation over the past few years, due to insufficient central financial resources, the policy of focusing on key areas has not been ideal, and some tendencies unfavorable to strengthening key projects have emerged. Since the second half of 1982, the scale of fixed asset investment in the entire society has been on an upward trend, increasing from 96.1 billion yuan in 1981 to 431.4 billion yuan in 1988, with a total construction scale reaching 1.3 trillion yuan, far exceeding the country's capacity. Non-budgetary state investment has expanded abnormally, while the proportion of budgetary state investment has been decreasing year by year, dropping from 66.4% in 1978 to 13.1% in 1987, resulting in fewer funds for national key projects. Although the state has invested heavily in energy, transportation, and raw material industries, due to insufficient funds, it is difficult to achieve faster development, failing to meet the needs of production and people's lives. Currently, the tight situation in energy and transportation has become a prominent weak link in the national economy. To accelerate key projects, in addition to appropriately concentrating funds, optimizing the investment structure, and improving investment efficiency, it is most important to adhere to the Party's established development strategy and major policies, and strengthen the central government's macro-control capabilities.

1. Adhere to the principle of long-term stable development. Our country has a large population, limited per capita resources, underdeveloped economy, and insufficient funds. Achieving socialist modernization will take a considerable amount of time. Historical experience shows that whenever the country adheres to the principle of acting within its means, concentrating financial and material resources, and carrying out key projects in a planned and step-by-step manner, it can have a significant impact on the entire national economy and produce far-reaching effects, achieving twice the result with half the effort. Conversely, whenever there is a rush for quick results and a one-sided pursuit of high speed, it inevitably leads to large fluctuations in basic construction, causing significant losses to the country and the people. According to estimates from relevant parties, several past upheavals in China have resulted in losses of several hundred billion yuan. Statistics show that after decades of hard work, by 1986, the original value of fixed assets formed by state-owned enterprises nationwide was only around 900 billion yuan, with a net value of just over 600 billion yuan. Therefore, in addition to having a stable and united environment, adhering to the principle of long-term stable development is crucial for China's economic construction.

2. Formulate industrial policies and strengthen planning management. Key projects in energy, transportation, and raw material industries require large investments and long construction periods, necessitating a stable medium- and long-term plan. Strengthening planning management first requires formulating and strengthening industrial structure policies that adapt to key projects. In conjunction with industrial policies, it is also necessary to formulate and issue industry development plans and technical policies. Domestic and international historical experiences show that adjusting industrial structures through spontaneous regulation is difficult, while using industrial policies for planned regulation is more effective. Using industrial policies to adjust industrial structures should include the use of necessary administrative measures. For example, small distilleries, small tobacco factories, small cotton mills, and small wool mills that compete with large enterprises for raw materials should be strictly prohibited to thoroughly solve the problem of "small squeezing big" and "inferior squeezing superior."

3. Appropriately concentrate the approval management power for construction projects. In recent years, the demand for investment has continued to expand, and the scale of investment has been seriously out of control, which is closely related to the decentralization of approval authority for construction projects. Due to excessive decentralization of approval authority, basic construction work has become chaotic. Currently, it is difficult for central authorities, let alone provincial, municipal, and autonomous region authorities, to grasp how many projects have been approved and what kinds of projects have been approved. To avoid losses, it is advisable to concentrate the approval authority for large- and medium-sized construction projects at the central and provincial, municipal, and autonomous region levels. Especially during the current period of rectification and adjustment, it is better to concentrate the approval authority for construction projects to better control the rapid expansion of investment demand and the adjustment of industrial structure. In this regard, Beijing has provided a good example. The approval work for construction projects in the entire city is managed by the municipal planning commission, especially for basic construction within the urban planning area, which is strictly controlled. For construction projects in remote suburbs that involve new land acquisition, they must also be approved by the municipal planning commission. For collective investment projects (such as township enterprises), they are unified into the investment plan by districts and counties for control. For individual investments, districts and counties control the land allocation, stipulating that each household can build no more than 1.2 mu of land. This controls the total scale of social investment in the entire city.

4. Increase tax revenue and strengthen the central government's macro-control capabilities to appropriately concentrate funds for key projects. After China adopted the "separate kitchen" fiscal system, central fiscal revenue decreased, and macro-control capabilities were weak. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually and appropriately increase the proportion of national fiscal revenue in national income from the current level of less than 20% to 28-30%; among which, the proportion of central fiscal revenue in national fiscal revenue should be increased from the current level of less than 50% to 60-70%. To enhance the central government's macro-control capabilities, the fiscal contract system of local governments should gradually transition to a tax-sharing system, concentrating major tax categories under central control. During the transition period, the central government can levy new tax categories and retain part of the benefits from price increases to make up for the central fiscal deficit. As the proportion of central fiscal revenue gradually increases, more funds should be concentrated for key projects. At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the collection of funds for key projects in energy and transportation, ensuring that they are fully collected and remitted.

5. Fully leverage the role of banks in improving the investment structure. Banks should provide loans according to the industrial policies formulated by the state, investing more in industries that the state prioritizes for development, less in general industries, and not at all in "long-term" industries. Currently, for buildings, conference halls, and high-end hotels, even with high-interest rates, loans should not be provided. At the same time, policy-based loans and commercial loans should be separated, managed by two different banking systems. Policy-based loans should be subsidized by the fiscal department to ensure the funding needs for infrastructure, basic industries, emerging industries, and important social undertakings.

6. Promote thrift and encourage residents' savings and develop old-age insurance to accumulate funds for the country's modernization. Our country's economy is underdeveloped, and per capita national income is low, making it inevitable to encounter funding shortages in economic construction. We should strive to raise funds from all aspects. For utilizing foreign capital, especially low-interest loans from foreign governments, we should adopt a positive attitude. However, considering that China will enter a peak repayment period in the early 1990s, relying more on foreign capital will be constrained by repayment capabilities. Therefore, we must advocate for thrift, hard work, and encourage residents' savings to accumulate funds for the country's modernization. China has significant potential to increase residents' savings. Currently, the savings rate for urban and rural residents is below 10%, and the current 38 billion yuan in savings is not much and can be significantly increased. Whether from the perspective of circulating currency, balancing demand, or increasing funds and developing production and construction, increasing residents' savings is a major measure. It is of great significance for the current rectification of the economic environment, curbing inflation, and the long-term stable development of the economy in the future. In addition to savings, developing old-age insurance is also an important way to turn consumption funds into development funds. To do a good job in residents' savings and old-age insurance, corresponding measures need to be taken: first, continue to advocate for the fine tradition of "hard work and thrift in building the country," mobilizing urban and rural residents to actively participate in patriotic savings and old-age insurance; second, it is necessary to increase savings interest rates, achieve savings appreciation, and improve old-age insurance methods to ensure that depositors and insured parties do not suffer losses.

7. Strengthen the management of basic construction and strive to improve the investment efficiency of key projects. Key projects have large investments and long construction periods. Only by strengthening the management of each link in basic construction can the use of investment be effectively improved. Improving investment efficiency should be reflected in shortening the construction period and reducing engineering costs. The following aspects of work should be done: (1) Control the total investment scale, which is an important prerequisite for improving investment efficiency. Currently, it is necessary to strictly follow the deployment of the State Council and do a good job in project rectification, stopping those "long-term" projects and projects that do not meet national regulations, making the total investment scale compatible with national strength, easing the supply and demand contradiction of materials and resources, ensuring key projects, reducing the consumption of materials and funds, and improving social benefits. (2) Seriously do a good job in the preliminary work of key construction projects. Projects that have not completed feasibility studies and preliminary design approval should not be listed as construction projects. (3) Design units should start from the overall interests of the state, strictly control design standards, carefully design, and strive to improve design quality to create conditions for reducing the cost of key projects. (4) Construction units should improve operational management, perfect the method of fixed wages per 100 yuan of output value, and genuinely improve labor efficiency and engineering quality to contribute to shortening the construction period and reducing the cost of key projects.

In summary, to build China into a developed socialist power, it requires arduous efforts. Construction funds mainly rely on domestic accumulation. It is necessary to appropriately concentrate funds and use them carefully. It is necessary to prevent excessive demand expansion and high consumption tendencies. It is necessary to adhere to the principle of long-term stable development and do a good job in national key projects. It is necessary to revitalize education, respect knowledge, respect talents, lead technological progress, accelerate economic development, and strive to gradually narrow the gap with developed countries in the fierce global economic competition.

    优化投资结构　保证重点建设
    杨振家
    建国以来，由于全国人民在党的领导下贯彻执行“艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国”的方针，国家集中了必要的财力和物力，先后建成了许多重要骨干项目，为我国奠定了工业化的基础。经过40年的努力，虽然我国经济仍然比较落后，但我国已经基本建成一个比较完整的国民经济体系。特别是改革开放10年来，我国已经取得了很大的成就，这是有目共睹的。今后我们要在这个基础上继续前进，就必须坚定不移地贯彻落实党的十二大提出、十三大继续强调的关于我国经济发展的战略方针，搞好重点建设。
    但是，从这几年的实际执行情况来看，由于中央财力不足，重点倾斜政策贯彻并不理想，而且出现了一些不利于加强重点建设的倾向。自1982年下半年来，我国全社会固定资产投资规模膨胀的势头一直居高不下，从1981年的961亿元膨胀到1988年的4314亿元，在建总规模已达1.3万亿元，大大超过了国家的承受能力。国家预算外投资畸形膨胀，而国家预算内投资的比重却逐年缩小，据统计，已由1978年的66.4％降到1987年的13.1％，致使国家重点建设资金来源越来越少。虽然国家在能源、交通运输、原材料工业建设方面花了很大力气，但终因资金不足，难以得到更快的发展，不能适应生产建设和人民生活的需要。当前，能源、交通运输紧张的状况已成为国民经济发展中突出的薄弱环节。为了加快重点建设，除要适当集中资金、优化投资结构、提高投资效益外，最为重要的是必须坚持党的既定发展战略和重大方针，并加强中央的宏观调控能力。
    一、坚持长期稳定发展的方针。我们国家人口多，人均资源少，经济不发达，资金短缺，实现社会主义现代化需要相当长的时间。历史经验证明，凡是国家坚持量力而行，集中财力物力，有计划有步骤地进行重点骨干项目的建设，就能对整个国民经济发生重大作用和产生深远影响，收到事半功倍的效果；凡是急于求成，片面追求高速度，就必然遭致基本建设的大起大落，给国家和人民造成重大损失。根据有关方面估计，我国历史上的几次折腾，损失了几千亿元。据统计，经过几十年的艰苦建设，到1986年，全国国营企业形成的固定资产原值也不过9000亿元左右，而净值仅为6000多亿元。因此，我国的经济建设除了要有一个安定团结的环境以外，坚持长期稳定发展的方针是十分重要的。
    二、制定产业政策，加强计划管理。能源、交通运输、原材料工业等重点建设项目投资大、建设周期长，必须有一个稳定的中、长期计划。而加强计划管理，首先就要制定与加强重点建设相适应的产业结构政策。与产业政策相配套，还应当制定、颁布行业发展规划和技术政策。国内外的历史经验证明，产业结构的调整靠自发调节较难，靠产业政策进行计划调节见效快得多。运用产业政策调整产业结构，应当包括采用必要的行政手段在内。比如，对于那些与大企业争原料的小酒厂、小烟厂、小棉纺厂、小毛纺厂等应当明令禁止，以彻底解决“以小挤大、以劣挤优”的问题。
    三、要适当集中建设项目的审批管理权。这几年，投资需求不断膨胀、投资规模严重失控，与基建项目的审批权限层层下放密切有关。由于审批权限下放过多，给基本建设工作造成了混乱。现在，各地究竟上了多少项目、什么项目，恐怕不仅中央主管部门弄不清楚，就是省、市、自治区的主管部门也难以掌握。看来，为了避免损失，大中型基建项目的审批权以集中到中央和省、市、自治区两级管理为宜。特别是在当前治理整顿期间，基建项目的审批权限更宜集中一些为好，以利于控制投资需求的急剧膨胀和产业结构的调整。在这方面，北京市提供了很好的经验。全市基建项目的审批工作，统由市计委归口管理，尤其对城市规划区内的基本建设管得很严。对于远郊区凡涉及新征土地的建设项目，也要报市计委审批。对于集体投资项目（如乡镇企业）由区、县统一纳入投资计划加以控制。对于个体投资，由区、县掌握批地，规定每户盖房不得超过1.2分土地。这样就控制了全市的社会投资总规模。
    四、增加税收，加强中央宏观调控能力，以利适当集中资金用于重点建设。我国实行财政“分灶吃饭”的体制以后，中央财政收入减少，宏观调控能力很弱。为此，要逐步地适当提高国家财政收入在国民收入中所占的比重，由目前的20％以下提高到28～30％；其中中央财政收入占国家财政收入的比重，应由现在的50％以下提高到60～70％。为了增强中央宏观调控的能力，地方政府财政包干体制应逐步向分税制过渡，把主要税种收归中央。在过渡阶段，中央可以开征新税种，并把涨价所得的好处收回一部分，以弥补中央财政不足。随着中央财政收入所占比重的逐步提高，要集中更多的资金用于重点建设。同时，要加强能源交通重点建设资金的征集，确保如数应征上缴。
    五、要充分发挥银行在改善投资结构方面的重要作用。银行要按照国家制定的产业政策进行贷款，对于国家重点发展的产业部门要多投，对于一般产业部门要少投，对于“长线”产业部门不投。当前，对于楼堂馆所、高级宾馆，即使利率再高，也不予以贷款。同时，银行的政策性贷款和经营性贷款要分开，由两套不同职能的银行体系分别进行管理。政策性贷款，由财政负责贴息，以保证基础设施、基础工业、新兴产业和重要社会事业发展的资金需要。
    六、提倡勤俭节约，鼓励居民储蓄，发展养老保险，为国家四化建设积累资金。我们国家经济不发达、人均国民生产总值少，在经济建设中遇到资金短缺的困难是必然的。我们应当想方设法从各方面筹措建设资金。对利用外资特别是外国政府的低息贷款，应持积极态度。但是，鉴于我国90年代初将进入还债高峰时期，更多地利用外资将受到偿还能力的制约。所以，我们必须提倡勤俭节约、艰苦奋斗，鼓励居民储蓄，为国家四化建设积累资金。我国增加居民储蓄还有很大潜力，目前城乡居民储蓄率在10％以下，目前3800亿元储蓄不算多，还可大大增加。无论从回笼货币、平衡需求或是从增加资金、发展生产建设来说，增加居民储蓄是一项重大措施，对当前治理经济环境、抑制通货膨胀和今后经济的长期稳定发展来说，都有十分重要的意义。除了储蓄之外，开展养老保险也是变消费基金为生产发展基金的一条重要途径。为了搞好居民储蓄和养老保险工作，需要采取相应的措施：一是提倡继续发扬“艰苦奋斗，勤俭建国”的优良传统，动员城乡广大居民积极参加爱国储蓄和养老保险；二是要提高储蓄利率，必须实现储蓄的保值、增值，同时要完善养老保险的办法，以保证储户和投保者不吃亏。
    七、加强基本建设管理，努力提高重点建设的投资效益。重点建设项目投资大、建设周期长，只有加强基本建设各个环节的管理，才能有效地提高投资的使用效果。提高投资效益，要体现在缩短工期、降低工程成本上，应当做好以下几方面的工作：（一）搞好投资总规模的控制，是提高投资效益的重要前提。当前，要坚决按照国务院的部署，认真做好项目的清理工作，把那些“长线”项目和不符合国家规定要求的项目坚决停下来，使投资的总规模与国力相适应，以利于缓和材料、物资的供需矛盾，确保重点建设，减少物资和资金的消耗，提高社会效益。（二）认真做好重点建设项目的前期工作。凡未做好项目可行性研究和未批准初步设计的项目，均不得列为开工项目。
  （三）设计单位要从国家全局利益出发，严格掌握设计标准，精打细算，精心设计，努力提高设计质量，为降低重点工程的成本，创造条件。（四）施工单位要改善经营管理，完善百元产值工资含量包干的办法，切实提高劳动效率和工程质量，为缩短重点工程的工期和降低工程的成本作出贡献。
    总的说来，要把我国建设成为世界上发达的社会主义强国需要艰苦努力，建设资金主要靠国内积累。要适当集中资金，并精打细算用好资金。要防止需求过度膨胀和高消费倾向。要坚持长期稳定发展的方针，搞好国家的重点建设。要振兴教育，尊重知识，尊重人才，领先科技进步，加速经济发展，力争在激烈的世界经济竞争中逐步缩短与发达国家的差距。
