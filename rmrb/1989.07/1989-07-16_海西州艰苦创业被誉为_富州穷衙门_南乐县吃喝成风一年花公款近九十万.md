Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 16th - (Reporter Wang Yuncai) For over 30 years, the leaders and ordinary officials of Hainan Mongolian-Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture have lived in low, dilapidated flat-roofed houses. Most officials still live in the flat-roofed houses built 35 years ago when the prefecture was established. The People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference of the prefecture still do not have a single office building, earning it the title of "Rich Prefecture, Poor Government."

Hainan Prefecture is located in the Qaidam Basin, which is rich in mineral resources. When the prefecture was established, there was almost no industry. After more than 30 years of development, it now has a relatively complete industrial system, including salt mining, salt chemical industry, oil extraction and smelting, and asbestos mining. The total industrial output value of the region has reached over 400 million yuan, increasing more than 1000 times compared to the early days of the prefecture's establishment, making it an important industrial base in Qinghai Province. Among the 31 ethnic autonomous prefectures in the country, Hainan Prefecture ranks first in per capita social total output value, per capita national income, and per capita local fiscal revenue.

The economy has developed, but Hainan Prefecture has not improved the living facilities of the party and government organs. Instead, it has invested the funds in productive development. Last year, relevant departments approved the construction of office buildings for the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference of the prefecture, as well as dormitories for the People's Congress. However, upon learning that the prefecture needed funds to build several factories, the People's Congress and the Political Consultative Conference of the prefecture gave up the plan to build the buildings. The Standing Committee of the People's Congress of the prefecture continues to work in cramped rooms. It is understood that there is not a single official above the level of deputy prefecture in Hainan Prefecture who has used their power to build private houses.

Our reporter, Li Jie, Li Erliang, July 16th - On one hand, advocating for clean governance, on the other hand, public feasting does not stop. In just one year, Nanle County spent nearly 900,000 yuan on public feasting and gift-giving. The leaders of Henan Province seized this typical case to sound the alarm again to all officials in the province.

Nanle County is a poor county in northern Henan, with a total fiscal revenue of only 8.45 million yuan last year. In April, after receiving letters from the public about the serious public feasting in the county, Governor Cheng Weigao immediately instructed the provincial audit and financial departments to organize a joint investigation team to conduct an investigation. The investigation results showed: Nanle County spent 897,400 yuan on public feasting and gift-giving last year, of which 863,400 yuan was spent on banquets and 34,000 yuan on gifts. From the county-level administrative and public institutions to the grassroots villages, except for a few units, all had expenses for public feasting, ranging from a few hundred yuan to tens of thousands of yuan. The methods of reimbursement and accounting were varied, and the sources of funds were diverse. Administrative and public institutions used administrative and public funds; institutions with revenue sources, such as government-enterprise combined units, used various fees for feasting; at the village level, where there were no other funds, the levy paid by farmers was squandered. The reasons for feasting were also varied: visits from superiors, friendly exchanges, work inspections, issuing ID cards, etc., were all opportunities for public feasting.

Governor Cheng Weigao of Henan Province emphasized again to all levels of officials, in the construction of clean governance, to focus on the "implementation" of the two words.

    海西州艰苦创业被誉为“富州穷衙门”
    南乐县吃喝成风一年花公款近九十万
    新华社西宁7月16日电　（记者王运才）青海省海西蒙古族藏族自治州从州级领导到一般干部30多年来一直住在低矮、简陋的平房里，大多数干部住的都是35年前建州时建起的平房，州人大、州政协至今还没有一栋办公楼，被称为“富州穷衙门”。
    海西州地处矿产资源丰富的柴达木盆地，建州时几乎没有什么工业，经过30多年的发展，现已拥有采盐、盐化工、石油采掘及冶炼、石棉开采等门类比较齐全的工业体系，全区工业产值达到4亿多元，比建州初期增长了1000多倍，成为青海省重要的工业基地。在全国31个民族自治州中，海西州的人均社会总产值、人均国民收入、人均地方财政收入均居全国第一位。
    经济发展了，但海西州并没有改善党政机关生活设施，而是把资金用在开发性的生产上。去年，有关部门批准建州人大、政协办公楼和州人大宿舍楼，可知道州里要建几座工厂缺乏资金后，州人大和州政协便放弃了盖楼的打算，州人大常委会依旧在拥挤的房里办公。据了解，海西州处级以上干部没有一个利用职权建私房的。
    本报郑州7月16日电　记者李杰、李而亮报道：一面倡导为政清廉，一面公费吃喝不止。南乐县公费吃喝送礼一年竟花去近90万元。河南省领导抓住这个典型，向全省干部再次敲响了警钟。
    南乐县是豫北穷县，去年全县财政收入只有845万元。今年4月，河南省长程维高接到群众反映该县公费吃喝严重的来信后，当即批示，由省审计、财政部门组织联合调查组前往核查。调查结果表明：南乐县去年公费吃喝送礼金额89.74万元，其中请客招待吃喝86.34万元，送礼3.4万元。从县委、县政府一级行政事业单位到最基层的村，除个别单位外，都有用公款吃喝的开支，少的几百元，多的几万元。报销入帐方法五花八门，资金来源各显神通。行政事业单位动用行政事业经费；有收费来源的政企合一单位，则把各项收费用于吃喝；村一级没其它资金，就把农民所交的提留款肆意挥霍。吃喝名目更是多样：上级来人、友邻往来、检查工作、办身份证等，都是公费吃喝的机会。
    河南省长程维高就南乐县这个典型再次向各级干部强调，在廉政建设上，要在“落实”二字上狠下功夫。
