	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 20th - (Correspondent Wu Zao Wen) Books that recount the revolutionary journeys of Deng Xiaoping and Luo Ronghuan, titled "Twenty-Eight Years—From Political Commissar to General Secretary" and "Memoirs of Marshal Luo Ronghuan," have recently been published in Shanghai.

	"The Twenty-Eight Years—From Political Commissar to General Secretary" is written by some of Deng Xiaoping's former subordinates. They vividly depict Deng Xiaoping's appearance, mannerisms, and deeds during his struggles from 1939 to 1965, making the reader feel both familiar and respectful.

	"The Memoirs of Marshal Luo Ronghuan" is authored by the veteran writer Bai Ren. In 1939, Bai Ren traveled thousands of miles to the enemy's rear, working alongside Luo Ronghuan. Starting from his most familiar experiences, Bai Ren wrote about Luo Ronghuan's arduous struggles, his resistance against Lin Biao's rightist thoughts during the Liaoshen Campaign, and after the founding of the nation, with the support of General Secretary Deng Xiaoping, Luo Ronghuan's stand against Lin Biao's fallacies.

	These two works are part of the large series "Biographies and Memoirs of Commanders" published by Shanghai Literature and Art Publishing House. This series has already published works such as "Memoirs of Liu Bocheng" and "Biography of General Xu Haidong."

    记叙邓小平罗荣桓革命业绩
    《二十八年间》等书出版
    新华社上海7月20日电　（通讯员吴早文）记叙邓小平和罗荣桓同志战斗历程的《二十八年间——从师政委到总书记》和《罗荣桓元帅纪事》新近在上海出版。
    《二十八年间——从师政委到总书记》的撰写者是当年邓小平部下的一些老同志。他们围绕邓小平同志1939年至1965年间的斗争生活的丰功伟绩，形象地描绘了邓小平同志的音容笑貌、言谈举止等等，读来可亲可敬。
    《罗荣桓元帅纪事》的作者是老作家白刃。1939年，白刃不远千里来到敌后，在罗荣桓同志身边工作。他从自己最熟悉的生活出发，写下了罗荣桓艰苦奋战的业绩，写下了罗荣桓在辽沈战役中与林彪右倾思想进行斗争，以及建国后在邓小平总书记的支持下，挺身而出，对林彪的谬论作批判的事实。
    这两部著作是上海文艺出版社大型丛书《将帅传记、回忆录》中的两部。这套丛书目前已出版了《刘伯承回忆录》、《徐海东将军传》等。
