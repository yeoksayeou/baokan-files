The New York-based Chinese-language newspaper *Zhongbao* published an editorial on July 26 titled "Human Rights or Human Rights?—Becoming a Tool to Attack Other Countries and People." The editorial criticizes the United States and some other Western countries for their criticisms of China on "human rights" issues. The following is a summary of the editorial:

During the Tiananmen Square incident, some intellectuals and students on the mainland shouted various slogans, including "fighting for human rights." During and after this period, some people in the United States, France, and other Western countries also made a lot of noise, blaming the mainland for having too few human rights. "Human rights" is an old issue. In particular, some officials in the United States often assume the dual roles of international police and world saviors, criticizing this or that country for violating human rights, with socialist countries often being their targets.

The term "human rights" became popular during the Enlightenment in Europe. At that time, the concept of "human rights" was proposed to oppose "divine rights." The so-called "natural rights" emphasized that people are born equal and that basic human rights should be guaranteed. This interpretation, in its literal sense, is naturally just and reasonable, and no one would object. However, under this slogan, many phenomena of human exploitation and oppression are often concealed.

For example, the United States, which shouts the loudest about human rights, frequently experiences incidents of racial discrimination. Although the authorities have legislated against it, inequality caused by racial discrimination is often seen. In South Africa, the human rights of blacks are trampled upon, but some big bosses in the United States still do big business with the white rulers there. Going back further, the U.S. military used biological weapons in the Korean War and defoliants in the Vietnam War, not even caring about the lives of civilians, let alone human rights! It is clear that those who shout the loudest about human rights are themselves ignoring human rights.

The United Nations has passed documents related to the protection of human rights, meaning that if a country has serious human rights violations, the international community should or can pay attention. However, the definition of human rights violations needs to be strictly explained and cannot be arbitrary, used to achieve certain purposes, or to arbitrarily label others. A country's actions against illegal behavior should not be immediately labeled as human rights violations; otherwise, it can be easily accused by those with ulterior motives.

In the "Universal Declaration of Human Rights" adopted and proclaimed by the United Nations on December 10, 1948, the second paragraph of Article 29 clearly states: "In the exercise of his rights and freedoms, everyone shall be subject only to such limitations as are determined by law solely for the purpose of securing due recognition and respect for the rights and freedoms of others and of meeting the just requirements of morality, public order and the general welfare in a democratic society." This means that the enjoyment of individual human rights must be subject to legal restrictions and must not interfere with the human rights of others, public order, and general welfare. Consider this time when Tiananmen Square was occupied for 7 weeks: did it exceed legal restrictions? Did it interfere with the human rights of others? Did it affect social welfare? This logic is very simple, so why can't those American officials who attack the Chinese government see it?

Last year, in a park in New York, some nearby residents gathered there to play after the park's nighttime closure rules were not followed, resulting in them being dispersed by the police and many being arrested. Although this incident was not very large, it was still an example of not violating the rule of law. From this small example, it can be seen that the Beijing authorities' clearing of Tiananmen Square was also justified. Why do some Americans insist on using double standards to look at problems?

Human rights or human rights, have become a tool for some people with ulterior motives to attack other countries and people, which is certainly not the original intention of the European Enlightenment thinkers. Some American politicians have played too many tricks on the issue of human rights.

### 《中报》批评西方借“人权”干涉别国内政  人权不应成为攻击他国之工具

    《中报》批评西方借“人权”干涉别国内政
    人权不应成为攻击他国之工具
    本报讯　美国纽约《中报》7月26日发表题为《人权乎人权——竟成攻击他国他人之工具》的社论，批评美国等一些西方国家在“人权”问题上对中国的责难，现摘要如下：
    在天安门学潮期间，大陆知识界及学生中的部分人士叫了不少口号，其中也有“争人权”的口号。在该期间及之后的这段时间里，美国、法国等西方国家的一些人，亦大肆鼓噪，责备大陆的人权太少了。“人权”是个老问题，尤其是美国的一些当权者，往往以国际警察和世界救星双重身份自居，指责这个或那个国家违反人权，而社会主义国家则多半是他们攻击的目标。
    “人权”二字是在欧洲启蒙运动中流行起来的。当时提出“人权”，是要与“神权”对立。所谓“天赋人权”，即是强调人生来便是平等的，并且要保证人的基本权利。这种解释，就字面上的意义来讲，自然是天经地义，谁也不会反对。然而，在这种口号之下，人剥削人、人压迫人的不少现象往往被掩盖。
    譬如叫人权叫得最响的美国，种族歧视的事件常常发生，当局虽然立法禁止，但由种族歧视所造成的不平等状况屡见不鲜。在南非，黑人的人权被践踏，但美国的一些大老板仍与那里的白人统治者大做生意。再追溯得远一些，美军曾在朝鲜战争时使用细菌武器，在越南战争时动用脱叶剂，连平民的生命也不管了，还顾什么人权！可见叫人权叫得震天价响的人，自己在罔顾人权。
    联合国曾通过有关维护人权的文件，也就是说一个国家如有严重违反人权的行为，国际社会应该或可以引起关注。唯对违反人权的定义，需要作严格的解释，不可随心所欲，为达到某种目的而乱戴帽子。一个国家对违法的行为采取行动，不可动辄称其为违反人权，否则的话，便随时可被别有用心者借故加以攻讦了。
    在联合国于1948年12月10日通过并宣布的“世界人权宣言”中，其第二十九条第二款明白地写着：“人人在行使他的权利和自由时，只受法律所制定的限制，确定此种限制的唯一目的在于保证对旁人权利和自由给予应有的承认和尊重，并在一个民主的社会中适应道德、公共秩序和普遍福利的正当需要。”就是说，个人人权的享有须受到法律的限制，且不能妨碍他人的人权、公共的秩序和普遍的福利。试观此次天安门广场被占领7个星期，是否越出了法律的限制？是否妨碍了他人的人权？是否影响了社会的福祉？这种道理很浅显，为什么美国那些攻击中国政府的人士看不到？
    去年在纽约一处公园内，附近一些居民在不得使用该园的夜间时间规定之后，仍聚集在那里玩耍，结果遭警方驱散，并有多人被捕。此事件规模虽不很大，但亦是不容破坏法制之案例。以小观大，北京当局在天安门清场亦无可厚非。为什么一些美国人偏要用双重标准来看问题？
    人权乎人权，竟然成了一些别有用心者攻击他国和他人之工具，此决非昔日欧洲启蒙家之初衷。美国某些政客在人权问题上玩的花样太多了。
