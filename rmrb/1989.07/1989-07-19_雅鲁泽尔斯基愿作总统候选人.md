Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 18th

Polish leader Jaruzelski on July 18th clearly stated that he is willing to be a presidential candidate.

He made this announcement in a statement during a meeting of the party's deputies.

In the statement, he said he was abandoning his June 30th decision not to run for the presidency. This change came after the deputies of the Polish United Workers' Party urged him to reconsider his decision. Additionally, recent developments have seen the highest leadership bodies of other parties in the ruling coalition— the United Peasants' Party, the Democratic Party, the Pax Association, the Christian Social Union, and the Catholic Social Union—all expressing support for Jaruzelski's candidacy.

He mentioned that his decision was also influenced by the need to ensure the continuity and stability of the state's operations. After considering these factors, he felt a sense of responsibility and decided to accept the suggestion from the coalition deputies to run as a candidate for the presidency of the republic.

The Polish presidential election is scheduled for July 19th.

    雅鲁泽尔斯基愿作总统候选人
    据新华社华沙7月18日电　（记者马云亮）波兰领导人雅鲁泽尔斯基18日明确表示他将愿作总统候选人。
    他是在该党议员团举行的会议上发表的一项声明中宣布这一决定的。
    他在声明中说，他放弃6月30日提出的不当总统候选人的立场。因为波统一工人党议员团当时要求他重新考虑这一决定。另外，最近又出现了一些新的情况：执政联盟派中的其他党团——统一农民党、民主党、帕克斯协会、基督教社会联盟和天主教社会联合会的最高领导机构都纷纷表示支持雅鲁泽尔斯基作为总统候选人资格的建议。
    他说，促使他改变以前决定的还有这样一些情况，即需要保障国家运转的连续性、稳定性。他对这些情况进行考虑后认为，“本着一种责任感”，他便决定接受联盟派各议员团的建议，同意作共和国总统候选人。
    波兰总统选举将于19日举行。
