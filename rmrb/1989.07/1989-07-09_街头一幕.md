A Street Scene

I once witnessed a scene like this: a heavy snowfall with flakes dancing in the air, countless children, dressed in red, green, and various other colorful snowsuits and down jackets, poured out of the school gates like penguins from the South Pole, covering the entire road. Vehicles passing by stopped one by one, forming two long lines of cars; the bustling city suddenly fell silent. At the same time, it seemed as if countless car horns were blaring in unison, singing a heartfelt salute to the future citizens of this republic.

Years have passed, and today, during the twilight of a deep autumn when leaves fall, I encountered an even more spectacular scene.

Four female teachers pulled two long ropes adorned with red and white flags, swiftly crossing the street to create a safe passage. A surging tide of young lives, children wearing red scarves on their chests, once again poured out of the school gates, passing through this harbor of love, playing a dazzling and glorious homecoming melody. Two long lines of cars and two rows of bicycles suddenly came to a halt, forming a loving and profound backdrop.

In the center of the tide, there was a thin, bespectacled female teacher who seemed like a child herself. With the composure and efficiency of a military commander, she directed her vast army. She ordered those who needed to turn left to turn left, those who needed to turn right to turn right, those who needed to slow down to slow down, and those who fell behind to catch up. The entire scene was filled with only her crisp commands. It was her orders that directed all the traffic and pedestrians, directing the entire city.

A young man beside me, perhaps truly having some urgent matter, looked at his watch and finally couldn't wait any longer. He reached out to lift the colorful rope, attempting to force his way through. Almost simultaneously, the female teacher's high heels tapped urgently, firmly gripping his handlebars, using all her strength to push him and his bike back. She sincerely and excitedly said, "Wait a moment, don't rush, it will be over soon. Just the other day, a child was run over, such a smart child!"

In that instant, I felt that this teacher, who was not particularly beautiful, was the most beautiful girl in the world; she, who appeared so frail, was actually the embodiment of the strongest force. Her still-youthful heart already held boundless love for her students and motherly affection! Looking at her passionate gaze behind her glasses, I wanted to say: Little teacher, you are truly beautiful! However, suppressing a strong urge, what came out was: Friend, wait a moment, this is the greatest treasure of many families, and you will have it too in the future.

The tide receded, and the children dispersed. The teachers on the opposite side quickly let go, and the two on this side hurriedly pulled the ropes back. However, the tide of bicycles began to surge forward. Watching those two colorful ropes being trampled under wheels and feet, I felt quite uncomfortable. The only way I could express my attitude was to wait quietly. I felt that those were not ordinary ropes, but something very sacred.

    街头一幕
    雪耕
    曾经目睹过这样的一幕，鹅毛大雪漫天飞舞着，无法数计的孩子们，那些穿着红红绿绿各式各样的滑雪衫和鸭绒服的孩子们，南极企鹅般地从小学的大门口涌出，覆盖了整个公路。来往的车辆一辆辆悄没声儿地自动停住，排起两列长龙般的车队；正值热闹高峰的城市，陡地静穆。同时，又仿佛有亿万支车笛亿万种声音，在胸腔内齐声鸣唱，向这共和国未来的公民热烈致礼。
    时间过去了很久，不想，今日黄昏，深秋叶落之际，又遇上更加壮观的一幕。
    四位女教师拉着两根缀满红白两色小旗的长绳，疾迅地横穿马路，挡出一个安全港般的通道。汹涌稚嫩的生命之潮，那些胸前佩带着红领巾的孩子们，再度从学校的大门涌出，经由这爱的安全港，奏起眩耀而又辉煌的归家乐章。两列长长的车队，和两排宽宽的自行车潮顿然静伫，形成慈爱而深厚的背景。
    潮的中央，有一位瘦弱的戴着眼镜的女教师，她还是个孩子呢！如三军指挥般镇定而利索地指挥着她庞大的军队。让向左的左拐，向右的右转，走快的慢点，掉队的跟上。整个场上，只有她清脆的号令声。而也正是她的号令，指挥了所有的车队和行人，指挥了整座城市。
    我身边的一个小伙子，也许真有什么急事，抬腕看看表，终于耐不住性子了，就伸手撩起彩绳，想强行穿越。几乎同时，女教师的高跟鞋已急急地敲过来，紧紧攥住他的车把，使出全身的劲儿，硬是把他连人带车推了回去。她诚恳而又激动地说：“等等，别急，马上就完了，前两天才轧死一个孩子，多聪明的一个孩子哪！”
    一刹那，我感到这位根本不漂亮的女教师，是天下最美的女孩；看上去弱不禁风的她，其实是最强大的力量的化身。她那尚属稚嫩的胸怀，已蕴含了无限的师爱和母爱啊！看着她镜片后面热烈的目光，我想说：小老师，您真美！然而，忍住一阵强烈的冲动，说出来的却是：朋友，等一下吧，这是好多个家庭无上的财富啊，将来，你也会有的。
    潮落了，孩子们散尽了，对面的女教师便赶紧撒手，这边的两位也急急地将绳往回拉。然而，自行车潮开始冲淹了。看着那两根彩绳，在轮下、脚下被肆意地践踏，我心里很不是滋味儿。我唯一的表明自己态度的办法，就是静静地等待。我觉得，那不是普通的绳子，而是很神圣的什么。
