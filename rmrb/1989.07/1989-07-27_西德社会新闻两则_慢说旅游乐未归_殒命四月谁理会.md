    Two Pieces of Social News from West Germany
    Slow to Return from Holiday, Death Unnoticed for Four Months

    According to a report by the DPA, a tenant in a Bremen apartment in West Germany had not paid rent, water, electricity, and telephone bills for four months. The mailbox was filled with letters and newspapers. The landlord assumed that the 63-year-old single tenant had gone on a holiday and forgotten to return, so he ordered a locksmith to open the door. It was then discovered that the elderly woman had died in her bedroom, her body already stiff. There was a shopping receipt on her table dated early March.

    A privately-run nursing home in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, West Germany, was recently ordered to close, and its director was arrested. Witnesses said the nursing home had been abusing the elderly, tying them up with ropes and forcing them to take sedatives. When the police were about to investigate the abuse of three elderly residents, they suddenly all died. Autopsies showed that they had been treated very poorly before their deaths, but no signs of unnatural death were found.

    养老院非疯人院　捆绑逼迫为哪般
    西德加米施—帕滕基兴一私人开办的养老院最近被勒令关闭，院长被捕。据证人说，这家养老院肆意虐待老人，用绳子捆绑他们，强迫服用镇定剂，当警察正准备调查其中3位老人受虐待的情况时，她们却突然全部死去。尸检证明，她们生前所受待遇极差，但却找不到任何非自然死亡痕迹。
