In the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, all communication personnel of the martial law troops firmly executed orders. Facing a dire and severe situation and extremely complex circumstances, they adapted to the unfamiliar geographical environment, frequent changes in deployment, and frequent adjustments in communication organization. They sent and received several million telegrams and handled hundreds of thousands of phone calls accurately and promptly. They ensured that wherever the troops went, the phone lines followed, earning praise from the military leadership.

During this counter-revolutionary rebellion, the rioters targeted communications as their primary objective for sabotage. Some of them shouted, "Destroy their radio stations, cut off their communications, and suffocate them here!" They also incited uninformed masses to throw bricks at communication vehicles. To avoid harming the people, the broad masses of communication personnel could not use firearms to protect their communication equipment. Instead, they used their blood and flesh, and their young lives to protect it.

Bo Ge, a telegraphist from the Beijing Military Region Communication Regiment, faced the rioters bravely. He protected the radio, communication documents, and codebooks with his life. Even after being severely injured and falling unconscious, he still held the documents tightly to his chest. During the surgery, he clung to the documents and only let go after handing them over to the visiting military leaders.

A group of rioters climbed onto the roof of a communication vehicle from a certain army group, shouting and smashing. The switchboard operator, Wang Zhenhou, led his team to throw themselves onto the switchboard, using their bodies to protect the machines. Many comrades were injured in multiple places. When the rioters smashed the radio vehicle's windows and threw bricks inside, the radio station chief, Wang Hongbo, and the telegraphist, Wang Guangwei, fearlessly used their bodies to shield the radio. They covered the radio with their blankets, while their own bodies were bruised and battered. Some were stabbed with knives, and their clothes were burned by cigarettes, but they bravely protected the radio.

The 285 communication personnel from a certain regiment, tasked with clearing Tiananmen Square, held the firm belief of "rushing into the square, not falling behind, and ensuring the completion of the communication mission." They broke through the rioters' blockades multiple times and all reached the square. A soldier from the regiment's wireless company, Chen Lijun, carried the radio motor and its accessories. His arm was fractured by the rioters, but he fearlessly pressed the motor tightly under his body, thus saving the equipment. The wireless squad leader, Xu Jie, hugged the radio to protect it from damage. His head was severely injured by bricks, and blood covered his face, but he still hugged the radio and rushed forward, arriving at the square on time.

The broad masses of communication personnel acted bravely and intelligently, ensuring the smooth execution of the martial law mission. The troops' railway transportation, motorized advance, assembly, training, capture of criminals, and defense of important targets all had uninterrupted communication. The forward command of a certain army group moved seven times, but communication remained uninterrupted.

Communication soldiers are the eyes and ears of the commanders and the nerves of the army. Over half a century, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our communication soldiers have walked a glorious yet arduous path. The vast lands of our motherland are marked by the footsteps of communication soldiers; the annals of the people's revolution record the glorious chapters written by communication soldiers. In this victory to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, they have added a new page.

    用青春铸就钢铁的神经
    ——记平息反革命暴乱斗争中的通信兵
    张东文
    在平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，戒严部队全体通信官兵，坚决执行命令，面对险恶严峻的形势和极端复杂的情况，努力适应地理环境不熟、部署多变、通信组织调整频繁等特点，先后收发电报几百万组，接转电话上百万件，准确及时，做到了部队开到哪里，电话就通到哪里，受到军委领导的表扬。
    这次反革命暴乱，暴徒把通信作为主要破坏目标，他们中有人狂喊：“砸毁他们的电台，不让他们联络，把他们都闷死在这里！”他们还煽动不明真相的群众用砖头向通信车袭击。为了不误伤群众，广大通信官兵不能用枪弹来保护通信装备，而是用自己的血与肉，用年轻的生命来保护。
    北京军区通信团报务员葛明军，遭暴徒袭击时，临危不惧，奋力保护电台、联络文件和密语表。被打成重伤昏迷后，他仍把文件紧紧护在胸前。在手术中他也牢牢地抓住文件不放，直到亲手交给前来看望他的部队领导才放心。
    一批暴徒冲上某集团军通信车顶狂喊乱砸，守机班长王振厚带领全班扑在总机台子上，用身体保护机器，许多同志身上多处负伤。在暴徒砸碎电台车玻璃、用砖头向车内袭击时，电台台长王洪波、报务员王光伟奋不顾身用身体掩护电台，并把自己的被子盖在电台上，而自己身上却被砸成青一块紫一块。有的身上被刀子捅破，衣服被烟头烧坏，始终英勇地保护了电台。
    执行天安门广场清场任务的某师285名通信官兵，抱着“冲进广场，决不掉队，人在机器在，一定要保证通信任务的完成”的坚强信念，冲过了暴徒的一次次封锁，全部到达广场。该师无线连战士陈立军背着电台马达及其附件，胳膊被暴徒打成骨折，但他毫无惧色，用身体将马达死死地压在身下，从而保住了设备。无线班长徐杰，为了保护电台免遭损坏，把电台抱在怀里，头部被砖块砸成重伤，血流满面，他仍抱着电台向前冲，按时到达广场。
    广大通信官兵英勇机智，出色地保障了戒严任务的顺利执行。部队铁路输送、摩托化开进、集结、驻训、抓歹徒、守卫重要目标，通信始终顺畅。某集团军前指7次转移，通信联络保持不中断。
    通信兵是首长的耳目，军队的神经。半个多世纪以来，我军通信兵在中国共产党的领导下，走过了艰苦曲折的光荣历程。祖国的万水千山无处不铭刻着通信战士前进的足迹；人民革命的史册，无处不记载着通信战士书写的光辉篇章。在这次胜利平息反革命暴乱中，他们又书写了新的一页。
