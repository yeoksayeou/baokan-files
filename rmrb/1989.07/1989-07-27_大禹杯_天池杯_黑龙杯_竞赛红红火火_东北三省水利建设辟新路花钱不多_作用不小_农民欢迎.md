The "Great Yu Cup," "Tianchi Cup," and "Black Dragon Cup" competitions, centered around agricultural water conservancy projects, have been vigorously carried out in the rural areas of China's three northeastern provinces in recent years. Vice Minister of Water Resources Hou Jie recently inspected flood control work in Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces and praised this activity as having opened up a new path for improving agricultural water conservancy projects.

Hou Jie said that this activity has effectively mobilized the farmers. It has ensured that the main body of increased agricultural investment—the farmers—actually invests. It has also mobilized the enthusiasm of leaders and various sectors at all levels, making the best use of the limited state funds for agricultural water conservancy projects, turning idle money into active money, and making one yuan into two yuan. It costs little but achieves a lot.

The "Three Cups" agricultural water conservancy competitions refer to the "Great Yu Cup" competition initiated by Liaoning Province in 1987 and the "Tianchi Cup" and "Black Dragon Cup" competitions launched by Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces at the beginning of this year. According to reports, each province has made specific regulations regarding the content, standards, rewards, and leadership methods of the competitions. Through the competitive format, the enthusiasm of a wide range of cadres and farmers to self-reliantly develop agricultural water conservancy projects has been mobilized, as well as the enthusiasm of various sectors to support agricultural construction, with remarkable effects. In just one year from 1987 to 1988, Liaoning Province completed 380 million cubic meters of earthwork, equivalent to the total amount completed during the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" period. The entire province worked an average of 24 labor days, raising 220 million yuan, equivalent to five times the annual agricultural water conservancy subsidy the state gives to this province. Currently, the earthwork project for the main stream of the Liao River has been basically completed, reaching the national flood control standards. Drainage, land reclamation, water and soil conservation, and the transformation of low-yield fields have all achieved very significant results. This spring, Liaoning Province experienced a rare drought in history, but due to the large-scale water conservancy projects carried out in recent years, the irrigated area has been expanded. 900,000 mu of paddy fields have all been transplanted and watered, and now the seedlings are full and strong, growing vigorously.

Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces have learned from Liaoning's experience. Jilin Province conducted a pilot project this year and has already seen results. Since Heilongjiang Province launched the "Black Dragon Cup" competition in March this year, the province has completed more than 70 million cubic meters of earthwork so far, equivalent to 2.5 times the amount of the same period last year, and has increased the irrigated area by 101.8 million mu.

    “大禹杯”“天池杯”“黑龙杯”竞赛红红火火
    东北三省水利建设辟新路花钱不多　作用不小　农民欢迎
    据新华社哈尔滨7月27日电　（记者张广远、通讯员王志民）以农田水利建设为中心的“三杯竞赛”活动，近几年在我国东北三省农村蓬勃展开。水利部副部长侯捷最近在辽宁、吉林、黑龙江三省检查防汛工作时，评价这一活动为搞好农田水利建设开辟了一条新路。
    侯捷说，它有效地把农民组织了起来。它使增加农业投入的主体——农民投入，落到了实处。它还调动了各级领导干部和各行各业的积极性，把国家有限的农田水利建设资金用活了，死钱变活钱，一个钱变两个钱，花钱不多，作用不小。
    “三杯”农田水利竞赛即辽宁省1987年率先开始的“大禹杯”竞赛和今年初吉林、黑龙江分别开展的“天池杯”、
  “黑龙杯”竞赛。据介绍，各省对竞赛的内容、达标标准、奖励办法、领导方法等都作了具体规定。通过竞赛的形式调动广大干部和农民自力更生开展农田水利建设的热情和各行各业支援农田建设的积极性，其效果十分明显。辽宁省仅1987年到1988年的1年间，就完成土方3.8亿立方米，相当于这个省“六五”期间完成量的总和；全省劳均24个工日，共集资2.2亿元，相当于国家每年给这个省的农田水利补助费的5倍。目前辽河干流治理土方工程已基本完成，达到国家规定的防洪标准。治涝、治洼、治山，水土保持，改造低产田，都取得了十分显著的效果。今年春季，辽宁省遭到了历史上少见的旱灾，但由于这几年大力兴修水利，扩大了灌溉面积，900万亩水田全部插上秧浇上水，现在苗全苗壮，长势喜人。
    黑龙江、吉林两省学习辽宁的经验，吉林省今年进行了试点，已见成效。黑龙江省今年3月开展“黑龙杯”竞赛以来，到目前为止，全省共完成土方7000多万立方米，相当于去年同期的2倍半，新增灌溉面积101.8万亩。
