Shanghai's tax and prosecution authorities have recently cracked down on 22 major tax evasion cases involving private entrepreneurs, with a total evaded tax amounting to over 2.76 million yuan. The Shanghai Procuratorate will file criminal charges against these individuals.

Among these 22 major cases, 11 involved tax evasion exceeding 100,000 yuan, with several being the largest tax evasion cases in Shanghai's history. One notable case involves "Sofa King" Lu Yundu, a prominent figure in Shanghai's private furniture industry. Lu used his individually operated enterprise to falsify production costs and conceal substantial sales revenue, evading national taxes amounting to over 310,000 yuan. In an attempt to evade legal punishment, Lu obtained a passport and visa, but was apprehended by the procuratorate just before he was about to leave the country.

The arrest of these "tax evasion kings" has caused a significant stir among private entrepreneurs in the same industry in Shanghai. Dozens of tax evasion criminals have voluntarily surrendered to the tax and prosecution authorities. The tax and prosecution authorities in various districts and counties of Shanghai are currently expediting the handling of over a hundred tax evasion cases involving private entrepreneurs. Additionally, 13 private entrepreneurs have already been sentenced for tax evasion crimes.

    上海侦破22起个体户特大偷税案
    偷税总额276万多元　13名偷税犯被判刑
    本报上海7月8日电　上海市税务、检察机关最近先后侦破了22起5万元以上的个体户特大偷税案，偷税数额达276万多元。上海检察机关将向法院提起公诉，追究他们的刑事责任。
    这22起特大个体户偷税案中，偷税数额超过10万元的有11起，不少案件都是上海建国以来罕见的个体户偷税大案。在上海个体家具行业中有名的“沙发大王”吕云度，利用个人承包企业经营，虚列生产成本，隐瞒巨额销售款，偷逃国税达31万多元。吕云度为了逃避法律的制裁，办了出国护照和签证，在他即将出国之际被我检察机关追捕归案。
    这些“偷税大王”被逮捕后，在上海同行业个体户中引起较大的震动，已有数十名偷税犯罪分子到税务、检察机关投案自首。上海各区县的税务、检察机关正在抓紧办理已经破获的百余起个体户偷税犯罪案件。此外，已有13名个体户偷税罪犯被依法判刑。
