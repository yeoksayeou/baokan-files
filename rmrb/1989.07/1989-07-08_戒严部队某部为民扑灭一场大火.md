More than 100 soldiers from the Second and Third Platoons of a certain unit of the martial law troops in Beijing rushed to extinguish a fire that broke out in the threshing ground of Xuxin Village, where they are stationed. Their bravery was praised by the local government and the people.

At around 11 PM on July 7, a sentry at the vehicle yard noticed that the threshing ground in Xuxin Village was ablaze, with flames lighting up half the sky. The troops quickly assembled and rushed to the threshing ground, which was about a mile away. The fire raged through the dry wheat straw, engulfing a 300-square-meter area and threatening to spread to nearby houses just 10 meters away. The high-voltage power lines overhead were also in danger.

The soldiers fought fiercely against the flames. Sergeant Ma Liangjun rushed forward and decisively used a shovel to break the lock and cut off the power. Lieutenant Zhao Linfeng led a group of soldiers to create a 3-meter-wide firebreak.

With the cooperation of nearby units, the troops extinguished the fire after two and a half hours of intense battle.

    戒严部队某部为民扑灭一场大火
    本报北京7月8日讯　首都戒严部队某部司训二连、三连的百余名官兵，在驻地徐辛庄村打麦场发生火灾时，奋勇扑灭烈火，受到当地政府和人民群众的称赞。
    7月7日夜间11时许，车场哨兵发现徐辛庄打麦场上，火光映红了半个天空。很快地，部队就集合起来，直奔一里路外的打麦场。火舌在干透了的麦秸上疯狂肆虐，300平方米地面上的麦秸垛烈焰腾腾，正向10米外的民房蔓延，凌空的高压输电线岌岌可危。
    官兵们与烈火展开了激烈搏斗。马良军上士冲上去，果断地用锹把砸开锁，拉闸断电；赵林峰中尉带领一部分战士打出了一条3米宽的隔离道。
    在闻讯赶来的兄弟部队的配合下，这支部队经过两个半小时的奋战，一场大火被扑灭了。（于稚鸿　尹守新）
