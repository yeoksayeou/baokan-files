France's "Europe Times" published an editorial on July 7 titled "Calmly and Objectively Reviewing the Beijing Incident." The editorial pointed out that it is unreasonable to blame the Chinese government for its measures to quell the riots. The following is a summary of the editorial:

In May and June of this year, due to the escalating student movements in Beijing and their spread to various parts of the country, different degrees of turmoil occurred. At that time, the situation on the Chinese mainland was extremely severe. Overseas Chinese, Chinese people, and students were all deeply concerned about the developments.

Fortunately, the Chinese mainland did not descend into complete chaos. By July, the situation across the country had generally stabilized, and social life had returned to normal. The speed at which the student movement evolved and the speed at which the riots were suppressed were both unexpected. Although people still have different views on this, one fact is clear: the Chinese government ultimately had the ability to control the situation. Contrary to the predictions of some soothsayers, the Chinese government did not collapse, and China did not plunge into full-scale civil war.

Now, let us calmly and impartially observe and comment on the Beijing incident. Many issues have become clearer.

Initially, the student movement raised reasonable demands such as "punishing corrupt officials," "eliminating corruption," and "promoting democratic politics." However, these good intentions were quickly exploited by some individuals to overthrow the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government. The subsequent developments made it clear that, due to the involvement of foreign forces and the premeditated actions of a small number of people, the students' actions could no longer be controlled by themselves. The slogans escalated, and the prolonged occupation of Tiananmen Square led to riots.

However, well-meaning people might think that, regardless of the circumstances, blood was shed and lives were lost in the process of suppressing the riots. Bloodshed and loss of life are not what anyone wants. However, the causes of the bloodshed and loss of life in this incident are quite complex. The top leadership of the Communist Party, including Zhao Ziyang, adopted a two-faced attitude towards the student movement, which allowed it to escalate into riots, and bears an irresponsible responsibility. People with common sense can see that, at the time, the turmoil caused Beijing to be almost paralyzed. It was difficult to restore order without deploying military and police forces. If it were not for the instigation of a small number of individuals, the spread of rumors, and the obstruction of the military's entry into the city, there would not have been bloodshed and loss of life. In the entire incident, if, as some news media reported, the military shot at anyone they saw, how could there be over 1,000 military and civilian vehicles burned? Even in a medium-sized battle, the military would not suffer such losses of vehicles and tanks. Regarding the clearing of Tiananmen Square, some news media insist that the military killed thousands of students and that tanks rolled back and forth through the crowd, but to this day, they have not provided any evidence, not even a single photograph or video clip.

Such a large-scale riot, occurring in any country, would not be allowed to continue unchecked by the government. Even in a country like the United States, conflicts between the military and civilians, resulting in bloodshed and loss of life, are often reported. It is unreasonable to blame the Chinese government for its measures to suppress the riots.

The Beijing incident has caused such a strong global reaction, partly due to the misinformation spread by some news media. Some media that claim to be objective and fair are themselves not objective or fair. In some cases, they lack the seriousness required for news reporting. For example, today they report that someone died, and tomorrow they say the person is alive; today they report that one military unit is fighting another, and tomorrow there is no trace of it. Later, these rumors proved to be false. They know that such reporting and sensationalism cannot be believed, but they still do it, leading people to suspect their motives.

Now, the situation in Beijing and across the country has returned to normal, but for the Communist Party and the Chinese government, the matter is not over. The upcoming tasks are more arduous. The most urgent task is to regain the trust of the people and restore the Party's authority. The top leadership must take concrete measures and achieve real results in punishing corrupt officials, eliminating corruption, promoting democratic politics, and stabilizing the economy.

Overseas Chinese, Chinese people, and students are genuinely concerned about the situation in China, hoping for its healthy development. The Communist Party and the Chinese government should learn from this experience, accelerate the promotion of democratic politics on the path of the rule of law, resolutely eliminate corruption among officials, continue with reform and opening up, and improve the economy and people's livelihood. Then, China will have great hope.

A country with 1.1 billion people will not yield to certain foreign forces. China's affairs must be handled by the Chinese people themselves, and China's path must be walked by the Chinese people themselves!

### 法国《欧洲时报》发表社论  冷静客观地回顾北京事件

    法国《欧洲时报》发表社论
    冷静客观地回顾北京事件
    本报讯　法国《欧洲时报》7月7日发表题为《冷静客观地回顾北京事件》的社论。社论指出，片面指责中国政府对平息暴乱所采取的措施没有道理。现摘要发表如下：
    今年五、六月份，由于北京的学潮愈演愈烈，而且波及全国各地，造成不同程度上的动乱。当时，中国大陆的局势是十分严峻的。海外广大华侨、华人和留学生无不忧心忡忡，关注着事态发展。
    所称幸的是，中国大陆最后没有发展到天下大乱。到了7月份，全国形势已趋向全面稳定，社会生活恢复正常。学潮演变之速出人意料，平定动乱之迅速同样出人意料。尽管人们至今对此有不同看法，但一个事实是：中国政府最终有能力控制局面。并没有像一些预言家所预测的那样，中国政府要垮台，中国要走向全面内战。
    现在，我们回过头来冷静地、公正地观察和评论北京事件，很多问题已看得清楚。
    学潮初起，广大学生提出了“惩办官倒”、“清除腐败”、“推进民主政治”等合情合理的要求。但是很快，这个良好的愿望被某些人利用来推翻中国共产党和中国政府。后来的事态发展不难看出，由于外国的势力和极少数人早有预谋，学生行动已不能由自己左右，欲罢不能，口号逐级升高，长期占领天安门广场，最后导致暴乱。
    但善良的人们可能认为，不管怎么说，在平息暴乱过程中，毕竟流了血，死了人。流血和死人，都不是人们所希望的。但是，所以造成这次事件的流血和死人，原因是十分复杂的。中共最高层赵紫阳等人对学潮采取两面的态度，使学潮演变成暴乱，负有不可推卸的责任。有常识的人都会看到，当时动乱造成整个北京几乎处于瘫痪状态，不出动军警是难以收拾局面的。如果不是极少数人挑动，制造谣言，阻止军队进城，也就不会发生流血和死人。在整个事件中，如果如一些新闻媒介说的那样，军队见人就开枪，怎么能够有1000多辆军车和公车被烧？就是一场中型的战役，军队也不会损失这么多的军车和坦克。关于天安门广场清场，一些新闻媒介坚持说军队杀死了几千学生，坦克在人群中碾来碾去，但至今拿不出这方面的证明，那怕是一幅照片或一个录像镜头。
    一次这样大的动乱，发生在任何国家，政府当局都不会听之任之。就连美国这样的国家，军警与民众冲突，发生流血和死人的事也常见之于报端。片面指责中国政府对平息暴乱所采取的措施是没有道理的。
    这次北京事件造成全球性这样强烈的反响，与某些新闻媒介的误导也不无关系。一些标榜客观、公正的新闻媒介，本身就欠客观、公正。在一些问题上，更缺乏新闻报道的严肃性。比如今天说这个人死了，明天又活了；今天说这支军队打那支军队，明天却无影无踪，等等，后来事实证明这些谣言不攻自破。他们明知道如此报道、渲染不能信服于人，而又偏要这样做，人们不得不怀疑他们的目的何在？
    现在，北京及全国的局势已恢复正常，但对中共和中国政府来说，事情并没有结束。今后的任务更艰巨。最紧迫的任务是要在人民中重树威信，取得人民的信任。最高领导层必须切切实实地在惩办官倒、清除腐败、推进民主政治、稳定经济等方面拿出办法和做出实绩来。
    海外华侨、华人和留学生对中国时局的关心，出于一片真心，其目的是希望中国健康发展。中共和中国政府应该很好地总结经验教训，在法制的轨道上加速推进民主政治，坚决肃清官员中的腐败现象，继续实行改革开放，把经济搞上去，人民生活得到改善，则中国是大有希望的。
    有11亿人口的中国不会屈服于某些外国势力。中国的事，还要靠中国人自己来做，中国的路，还要靠中国人自己来走！
