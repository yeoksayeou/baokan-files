Xingguo County, located in the mountainous region of Jiangxi's southern Gan area, has integrated mountain rehabilitation, afforestation, and the greening of barren hills with efforts to alleviate poverty and revitalize the old revolutionary base area, resulting in a significant transformation of the rural landscape.

Xingguo County is a revolutionary old base area. Before the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, due to indiscriminate logging, the forest vegetation was severely damaged. By 1980, the area affected by soil erosion accounted for 84% of the county's arable land, and the people's living conditions were extremely poor. This situation prompted county leaders to realize that to alleviate poverty and achieve prosperity, they must focus on mountain rehabilitation and afforestation. Over the past nine years, the county has developed and rehabilitated 166,000 hectares of mountainous land, which is half of the county's total mountainous area. Additionally, 41 million trees have been planted along roadsides and rivers, and 170,000 hectares of land have been closed off for forest regeneration each year, transforming vast barren hills into lush green landscapes.

Today, Xingguo County's forest coverage has increased from 22% in 1980 to 38%, and the area affected by soil erosion has been reduced by half.

    兴国县治穷先治山
    植树造林使老区面貌改观
    本报讯　记者赵相如报道：地处江西赣南山区的兴国县，把治山造林、绿化荒山、开发宜林山地与治穷致富、振兴老区结合起来，使山乡面貌改观。
    兴国县是革命老区。十一届三中全会前，由于乱砍滥伐，森林植被遭到严重破坏，到1980年时，全县水土流失面积占全县耕地84％，人民生活十分贫困。这一情况促使县领导警醒，认识到要治穷致富，必须治山造林。9年来，全县共开发治理山地166万亩，占全县山地面积的一半，并完成四旁植树410万株，年封山育林面积170万亩，使大片荒山披上了绿装。
    如今兴国县，森林覆盖率已由1980年的22％增加到38％，水土流失面积减少了一半。
