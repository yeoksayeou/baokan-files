Under the new historical conditions of reform and opening up, China's literary and artistic undertakings have developed significantly in scale. Whether in literature, drama, film, or other artistic genres, remarkable achievements have been made. However, it is undeniable that due to the lack of serious and comprehensive implementation of the correct line and policies regarding literature and arts established by the Party, serious issues have arisen in this field in recent years, with the spread of bourgeois liberalization trends. Currently, all fronts are reflecting seriously on the future, and the literary and artistic circles are no exception.

There have been differing opinions on whether bourgeois liberalization trends and tendencies exist in the literary and artistic circles. However, it is now difficult to deny their existence. First, in the turmoil and rebellion aimed at overthrowing the Communist Party and socialism, the literary and artistic circles were not without individuals deeply involved. Their speeches and actions during the few dozen days fully exposed their faces of promoting bourgeois liberalization. Second, in recent literary and artistic works and theoretical works, there are also many that propagate bourgeois ideological concepts and value orientations that are opposed to socialism. Among them, revolutionary traditions and revolutionary literature are denigrated, and socialist and communist moral ethics are criticized, while bourgeois abstract humanism and individualism, hedonism, and personal values are advocated. "Sexual arts" and "violent arts" that spread decadent ideas are rampant in the literary and artistic market, corrupting people's aesthetic tastes and souls. Today, people only need to look at the bookstalls on the streets to sigh that they have indeed gone too far.

The emergence of this situation is, of course, due to deep-seated reasons. First, under the historical conditions of opening up to the world in all directions, the infiltration of bourgeois ideological trends from abroad is inevitable. Since the Renaissance in Western Europe, bourgeois thought and culture have a history of several hundred years. The development of contemporary bourgeois economy and science and technology has given this thought and culture a broad advantage and possibility for dissemination. Second, China is still in the primary stage of socialism. The social structure of this stage, where multiple forms of ownership coexist, also makes it easier for certain strata to be influenced by bourgeois ideological and cultural concepts. However, from a macro perspective, what is more thought-provoking is the mistakes in our work, which resulted in the failure to prevent and correct erroneous tendencies that could have been prevented and corrected. Instead, due to the unprincipled support and indulgence, they have spread even more. I believe that these mistakes in literary and artistic work mainly include the following aspects:

First, there is a one-sided understanding of "creative freedom" and "critical freedom." Freedom is never absolute. There is no freedom in the world that is purely based on subjective will and unrestrained. In the field of literature and arts, Lenin once sharply exposed the hypocrisy of bourgeois literary freedom, pointing out that it is merely a freedom dependent on the bourgeois "pocketbook," "purchase," and "domestication." He said, "Living in society but being free from society is impossible." Indeed, Lenin expected socialist literature to be "free literature," because he believed that this literature "is not greed or ambition, but socialist thought and sympathy for the working people will gather a new force into its ranks," and "it will not serve the well-fed ladies, not serve the bored and fat 'tens of thousands of upper-class people,' but serve the millions of working people...." It can be seen that the freedom of socialist literature must be based on serving the people and serving socialism. The Party's guidance of literature and arts is necessary because the Party's purpose is to wholeheartedly serve the people and strive for the cause of socialism and communism. Only the Party's leadership, especially the Party's strong ideological leadership, can ensure that literature and arts serve the people and socialism. Forgetting this point, misinterpreting the "creative freedom" and "critical freedom" of literature and arts as the freedom to do as one pleases, and even using literary works and treatises to achieve the goal of denying the Party's leadership and the socialist system, is not a thorough promotion of bourgeois liberalization? How can there be any socialist literature if one understands "creative freedom" and "critical freedom" in this way? Yes, literary creation and criticism, as creative spiritual labor, require the freedom of the soul. But this freedom is also based on their grasp of necessity and a deep understanding of the laws of socialist literature and arts. Serving the people and socialism is the most essential law of socialist literature and arts. What writers, artists, and critics write and how they write, although they should not be subjected to arbitrary interference, does not mean that their writing is not subject to their own socialist conscience; at the same time, it does not mean that the Party can therefore abandon the leadership of literature and arts, especially ideological leadership, nor does it mean that the Party can ignore the direction of literature and arts. It is precisely the biased understanding of this issue and the resulting work mistakes that have allowed bourgeois liberalization trends to spread in the field of literature and arts. Isn't this a lesson to be learned?

Second, there is a one-sided understanding of the policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," "using the past to serve the present and using foreign things to serve China," and "innovating." When Mao Zedong proposed these policies, the purpose was to promote the prosperity of science and art in the socialist era, promote the development of Marxism, and promote the proletariat to occupy the ideological and cultural front. He pointed out, "Not criticizing and letting erroneous thoughts spread everywhere, allowing them to occupy the market, is of course not acceptable." He also proposed the standards for distinguishing between fragrant flowers and poisonous weeds, pointing out that among these standards, "the most important are the socialist road and the Party's leadership." However, these have gradually been forgotten in recent years. Works and treatises with erroneous tendencies, and even those that oppose and defame the Party's leadership and distort the socialist road, are often ignored, as if anything new is good, even if it is just a new way of selling old antiques or peddling new Western bourgeois decadent goods. Whoever dares to criticize is immediately accused of "beating people with a stick" and labeled as "destructive thinking." There is a tendency to allow one side to set fire and not allow the other side to light a lamp. For the development model of socialist literature and arts, of course, we should advocate a multi-element pattern of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," rather than a "single flower blooming and a single school contending." To promote the prosperity of literature and arts, we should advocate the diversification of creative themes, subjects, forms, and styles, and advocate the contention of different opinions and schools. We should learn from and draw on the good things of the ancients and foreigners. Socialist literature and arts should surpass the ancients and capitalist literature and arts, and should learn more and draw on more. Innovation is one of the essential trends of literature and arts, and should not be neglected. But we should not distinguish between the essence and dross of the "ancient" and "foreign," and multi-element should not be without advocacy and leadership, and should not abandon the responsibility of Marxist literary and artistic theory and criticism. On the contrary, the Party and state's literary and artistic leadership departments and media departments should never forget this responsibility. If truth, goodness, and beauty do not compete and compete to defeat falsehood, evil, and ugliness, and if multi-element is seen as liberalization, distinguishing between good and bad, right and wrong, and even confusing right and wrong, black and white, and allowing bourgeois liberalization trends to occupy the literary and artistic market, what will the consequences be?

Third, there is a one-sided understanding of the value of literary and artistic products. The beauty of literary and artistic products comes from reality and may be higher than reality. As a spiritual creation of humanity, literary works are no less than the crystallization of beauty and the flowers of wisdom. Excellent literary works are priceless treasures, and their spiritual influence may last forever. Therefore, even today, when literary and artistic products have the attributes of commodities, we should not simply regard them as ordinary commodities. Socialist literature and arts are part of socialist spiritual civilization, and should promote the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the consolidation and development of the socialist economic base. Lu Xun once compared literature and arts to "the guiding light of the nation's spiritual future." Excellent literary works often shape the souls of not just one generation and enlighten the wisdom of many readers. Therefore, it is both one-sided and short-sighted to measure the benefits and value of literary works solely by market prices and profits. Using this as the sole basis for literary planning and investment is even more absurd. It should be seen that compared to the capitalist spiritual civilization with a history of several hundred years, the socialist spiritual civilization with communism as its goal is still very young. The historical task of creating such a civilization is extremely arduous. If a socialist country does not make the necessary investment in this regard, and treats the construction of socialist spiritual civilization and the cause of socialist literature and arts as the same as the production of material products, requiring literary departments and literary publications to make money and be self-sufficient, without adopting policies that are considerate and tilted in business planning and investment, the consequences will be very serious. In fact, even the production of material products, the state also has priorities in planning and investment. Products that are slow to yield but are needed for the national economy and people's livelihood must also be invested in. The economic benefits and social benefits of literary and artistic products are not always consistent. Good economic benefits and poor social benefits are common. In the long run, the social benefits of literary and artistic products improve and transform the overall cultural quality and spiritual outlook of the nation through subtle influence. Measuring the value of literary works by the box office value and book sales price for a short period is not only one-sided in recognition but also harmful in practice. It should be known that socialist ideology needs to be instilled, not spontaneously generated from the masses, even in the working class. This was pointed out by the revolutionary leaders long ago. In a country like China with a large number of small producers, the reality of the soil is more likely to spontaneously produce thoughts tending towards capitalism and even feudalism. The readers and audience of literature and arts need guidance, not to be left to vulgar tastes. Therefore, it is necessary to invest in and support works with a clear socialist tendency, deeply reflecting the people's lives and struggles, and providing broad readers and audiences with beautiful enjoyment and sublime spiritual sublimation, as well as artistic treatises with true insights, so that they can be disseminated through relevant media. In recent years, serious books have been on the verge of collapse due to not being able to make money, and have even been rejected by some publishing departments. The publication of valuable artistic treatises is even rarer, while harmful books that promote obscenity and theft are popular, often printing tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of copies. If this abnormal situation is not changed, then the development of socialist literature and arts and the construction of socialist spiritual civilization will inevitably become empty talk.

The reflection on literature and arts can be summarized in one sentence: do not forget the socialist direction, and do not forget the difference between socialist literature and arts and capitalist and feudal literature and arts. Serving the people and serving socialism is the direction. Socialist ideology should be the spiritual pillar of uniting and inspiring the people and promoting historical progress in the current stage. The multi-element of literature and arts should not allow works and treatises that poison the people's spirit, dissolve and disperse the people's fighting spirit, and make the broad readers and audience lose the correct political direction to spread freely. Otherwise, it will cause the degeneration of people's spiritual realm and cause historical retrogression!

Based on historical practice, China, as a socialist country, has no way out without reform and opening up. In the new historical conditions, adhering to the old ways and closing the door will only lead to backwardness and being beaten. The essence of reform and opening up is to seek and explore the optimization of the socialist development model and to make the most of the advantages and avoid the disadvantages. Chinese socialist literature and arts have had brilliant achievements and also gone through serious setbacks. Due to the continuous development of vulgar sociology and leftist dogmatism, our literature and arts have gradually deviated from the active, open, and multi-element pattern of the early days of the founding of the country to a closed and rigid one-element pattern, resulting in the ten-year literary and artistic desert of the "Cultural Revolution." Since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, under the guidance of the Party's line, it has once again returned to an active, open, and diversified pattern, but the problem of bourgeois liberalization trends has emerged. In reflecting on historical lessons and embarking on the future journey, we should both adhere to the four cardinal principles and adhere to reform and opening up, firmly believing that the vast majority of comrades in the literary and artistic circles support the Party's leadership and are willing to serve the people and socialism. Even if some comrades have been confused or have unclear understandings on certain issues, they will definitely be able to quickly improve their understanding through serious reflection. People will also be convinced that as long as the vast number of literary and artistic workers in China unite and firmly advance along the socialist direction, the healthy development and further prosperity of literature and arts will definitely be achieved.

    坚定社会主义文艺方向
    张炯
    在改革、开放的新的历史条件下，我国文艺事业的规模有很大发展，无论文学、戏剧、电影或其他艺术门类都取得显著的成绩。但不容否认，由于没有能够认真地全面地执行党所制定的正确路线和有关文艺的方针政策，近几年这个领域也出现了资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的严重情况。当前各条战线着眼未来都在进行认真的反思，文艺界自不例外。
    对于资产阶级自由化思潮与倾向在文艺界是否存在，曾有过不同意见。但今天要否定这种存在已是很困难了。因为，第一，在利用学潮搞动乱，策划推翻共产党和社会主义的暴乱中，文艺界并非没有人深深地卷入，在几十天的历史表现中，他们的言论和行动都已充分地暴露出自己推行资产阶级自由化的面目；第二，在近年的文艺作品与理论著作中，也不乏宣扬与社会主义相对立的资产阶级思想观念与价值取向之作，其中，革命传统和革命文艺受到贬斥，社会主义、共产主义道德伦理受到批判，而资产阶级的抽象人性论和个人至上、享乐第一的人生观、价值观受到鼓吹，传播腐朽观念的“性文艺”与“暴力文艺”更充斥文艺市场，败坏人们的审美趣味，腐蚀人们的心灵世界。于今，人们只要看看各地街头的书摊，便不能不嗟叹它们实在走得太远了。
    出现这种状况当然有着深刻的原因。一是在对世界各国全方位开放的历史条件下，国际资产阶级思潮的渗透不可避免。自西欧文艺复兴，资产阶级思想文化的兴起已有数百年的历史，当代资产阶级经济和科学技术的发展，更给这种思想文化以广泛传播的巨大优势和可能。二是我国尚处于社会主义初级阶段，这阶段多种经济所有制并存的社会结构，也使某些阶层比较容易接受资产阶级思想文化观念的影响。不过，从全局上看，更为发人深思的还是我们工作中的失误，以致本来可以防止和纠正的错误倾向没有得到有力的防止与纠正，甚至因无原则的扶植与放纵，更加泛滥开来。我以为这些失误在文艺工作中主要有如下方面：
    第一，片面理解“创作自由”和“评论自由”。自由从来不是绝对的。世界上不存在纯凭主观意志，不受制约的自由。在文艺方面，列宁曾尖锐地揭露资产阶级文学自由的虚伪性，指出那不过是依赖于资产阶级“钱袋”、“收买”和“豢养”的自由罢了。他说，“生活在社会中却要离开社会而自由，这是不可能的”。的确，列宁期待社会主义文学“将是自由的文学”，那是因为列宁认为这种文学“不是贪欲也不是野心，而是社会主义思想和对劳动人民的同情将招集一批又一批新的力量到它的队伍里来”，并且“它将不是服务于饱食终日的贵妇人，不是服务于百无聊赖和胖得发愁的‘几万上等人’，而是服务于千千万万的劳动人民，……”。可见，社会主义文艺的自由必须以为人民服务、为社会主义服务作为前提。共产党对于文艺的引导之所以必要，因为共产党的宗旨就是全心全意为人民服务，为实现社会主义、共产主义事业而奋斗，只有共产党的领导、特别是党的强有力的思想领导，才能够保证文艺为人民、为社会主义服务的方向。忘记了这一点，把文艺的“创作自由”与“评论自由”曲解为可以随心所欲的自由，乃至是可以利用文艺作品与论著来达到否定共产党的领导、否定社会主义制度为目的的自由，那不是地地道道的推行资产阶级自由化吗？这样去理解“创作自由”与“评论自由”，还有什么社会主义文艺可言呢？是的，文艺创作与评论作为创造性的精神劳动，作家、艺术家和评论家都需要有心灵的自由。但这种自由也基于他们对于必然的把握，对社会主义文艺规律的深刻认识。为人民、为社会主义服务就是社会主义文艺的最本质的规律。作家、艺术家、评论家写什么和怎样写，虽然不应受到蛮横无理的干预，但这并不说明他们的写作可以不受自身的社会主义良知的制约；同时也并不说明党因此就可以放弃对文艺的领导，特别是思想的领导，更不意味着党对文艺方向可以不闻不问。正是对这一问题认识的偏颇和由此而产生的工作失误。才使资产阶级自由化思潮在文艺领域泛滥起来，这难道不是发人深省的吗？
    第二，片面理解“百花齐放、百家争鸣”，“古为今用、洋为中用”，“推陈出新”的方针。毛泽东同志当年提出这些方针，目的在于促进社会主义时代科学与艺术的繁荣，促进马克思主义的发展，促进无产阶级去占领思想文化阵地。他指出，“不加批评，看着错误思想到处泛滥，任凭它们去占领市场，当然不行”。他还提出区别香花、毒草的标准，指出这些标准中，“最重要是社会主义道路和党的领导两条”。而近几年，这些都似乎被渐渐淡忘了。具有错误倾向的文艺作品和论著，乃至反对和丑化共产党的领导，歪曲社会主义道路的作品，也往往视而不见，似乎只要是新的就是好的，哪怕只是变着花样兜售陈年老古董或贩卖新趸来的西方资产阶级的腐朽货色。谁要是敢提出批评，立即便被诬为“打棍子”，斥为“破坏性思维”。大有只许一方放火，不许另一方点灯之势。对于社会主义文艺的发展模式来说，当然我们应该提倡“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的多元格局，而不应该搞“一花独放，一家独鸣”。为了文艺的繁荣，应该提倡创作题材、主题、形式、风格的多样化，提倡不同意见、不同学派的争鸣。对于古人和外国的好东西一定要学习和借鉴，社会主义文艺要超越于前人，超越于资本主义文艺，就更要多方学习和广泛借鉴。创新是文艺的本质趋向之一，更不应忽视。但对“古”与“洋”都不应不分精华与糟粕，多元化也不应没有倡导和主导，更不应放弃马克思主义文艺理论批评的责任，相反，党和国家的文艺领导部门和传播媒介部门，都应该时刻不忘记这方面的责任。要知道如果真、善、美不在竞赛和竞争中去战胜假、恶、丑，而把多元化看成是自由化，香臭不分，良莠不辨，甚至是非混淆、黑白颠倒，听任资产阶级自由化的思潮去占领文艺市场，那岂非后果不堪设想吗？
    第三，片面理解文艺产品的价值。文艺产品的美虽然源于现实，又可能高于现实。作为人类的精神创造物，文艺作品不啻是美的结晶，心灵智慧的花朵。优秀的文艺作品乃是无价之宝，其精神影响甚至久传不朽。因而，在今天，即使文艺产品具有商品的属性，我们也不应简单地把它看成是一般的商品。社会主义文艺是社会主义精神文明的一部分，并且理应促进社会主义精神文明的建设，促进社会主义经济基础的巩固与发展。鲁迅曾把文艺比作“引导国民精神前途的灯火”。优秀的文艺作品常常能够塑造不止一代人的心灵，启悟许多读者的智慧。所以，仅仅以市场价格、以赚钱与否来衡量文艺作品的效益和价值，无疑既片面又短视，以此作为文艺规划与投资的唯一根据，尤属荒谬。要看到，比之已有数百年历史的资本主义精神文明，以共产主义为目标的社会主义精神文明还十分年轻，缔造这样的文明的历史任务是极其艰巨的。社会主义国家如果不在这方面作出应有的投资，把社会主义精神文明的建设，把社会主义文艺事业也等同于物质产品的企业，要求文艺部门、文艺书刊一律赚钱，一律自负盈亏，而不在事业规划与投资上采取有所照顾和倾斜的政策，那后果就会极其严重。事实上就是物质产品的生产，国家在规划和投资上也是有轻重缓急的。收益慢、投资大但确为国计民生所需要的产品，国家也不能不投资。文艺产品的经济效益与社会效益并非都一致。经济效益好与社会效益不好是常有的。从长远说，文艺产品的社会效益在潜移默化中提高和改造国民的整个文化素质与精神面貌。以一时的票房价值和售书价码去衡量文艺作品的价值，不仅认识上是片面的，而且实践上是有害的。需知社会主义思想需要灌输，而非自发从群众中产生，即使在工人阶级中也如此。这是革命导师早就指出过的。在中国这样拥有大量小生产者的国度里，现实土壤倒容易自发地产生倾向于资本主义乃至封建主义的思想。文艺的读者和观众需要引导，而非听凭庸俗欣赏趣味去支配。因此，在投资上扶植和赞助具有鲜明社会主义倾向，深刻反映人民生活斗争，给广大读者和观众以美的愉悦和崇高精神升华的作品，以及具有真知灼见的文艺论著，使之通过有关媒介得以传播，是十分必要的。近年文艺市场上，严肃的书刊因不能赚钱而朝不保夕，甚至被有的出版部门拒之门外。有价值的文艺论著的出版更为凤毛麟角，而有害的诲淫诲盗的书刊却得以风行，动辄印刷几十万、上百万册，这种不正常的局面如不改变，那么，我们发展社会主义文艺，建设社会主义精神文明，就势必要流为一句空话。
    对于文艺的反思，归结起来恐怕就是一条，即不可忘记社会主义方向，不可忘记社会主义文艺与资本主义、封建主义文艺的区别。为人民服务、为社会主义服务，就是方向。社会主义思想应该是现阶段我国文艺团结人民，鼓舞人民，推动历史前进的精神支柱。文艺的多元化决不应让那种毒害人民精神，瓦解和涣散人民斗志，使广大读者和观众迷失正确政治方向的文艺作品和论著自由泛滥。否则就会造成人们精神境界的沦落，就会造成历史的倒退！
    基于历史的实践，我国作为社会主义国家，不改革、开放是没有出路的。在新的历史条件下墨守成规、固步自封只能落后挨打。而改革、开放的实质就在于寻求和探索社会主义发展模式的优化选择，尽可能扬长避短。我国社会主义文艺有过光辉的成就，也有过严重的曲折。由于庸俗社会学和左倾教条主义的不断发展，我们的文艺曾从建国初期欣欣向荣的活跃、开放的多元格局逐渐走向封闭、僵硬的一元格局，出现了“文化大革命”十年的文艺荒漠。新时期以来，在党的十一届三中全会路线引导下，才重又走向了活跃、开放的多样化局面，而问题又在出现了资产阶级自由化的思潮。在反思历史教训，踏上未来征途时，我们应当既坚持四项基本原则，又坚持改革、开放，深信文艺界的绝大多数同志都是拥护党的领导，愿意为人民服务、为社会主义服务的。有的同志即使一时在某些问题上有过迷误或认识不清，也一定能够通过认真的反思而迅速提高认识的。人们也会确信，只要我国广大文艺工作者团结起来，坚定地沿着社会主义的方向前进，那么，文艺的健康发展和进一步繁荣，也是一定能够实现的。
