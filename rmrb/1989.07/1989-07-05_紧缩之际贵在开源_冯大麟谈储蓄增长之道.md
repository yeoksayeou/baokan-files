	In Times of Austerity, the Key is to Increase Revenue
	—Feng Dalin on the Path to Increasing Savings
	By Dong Huanliang, People's Daily Reporter

	“To solve the problem of funding for social development, should we rely on issuing more currency or on attracting more social savings? Clearly, the latter is the correct choice.” Professor Feng Dalin, who is nearing his seventies and has white hair at his temples, spoke frankly and analytically about the path to increasing savings.

	Professor Feng, who once served as the president of Shaanxi University of Finance and Economics, has been engaged in teaching and research for nearly forty years. He said that international experience shows that in developing countries, due to the underdeveloped financial markets, savings are the main channel for absorbing social funds and the primary source of bank credit funds. Currently, the total savings of urban and rural individuals in China amount to over 410 billion yuan, accounting for 40% of the total bank credit. Including government and enterprise deposits in banks, various types of deposits account for about 70% of the total credit. Because savings are so significant, in recent years, the People's Bank of China and various specialized banks have all regarded attracting savings as a top priority, “eight immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own abilities.”

	“Currently, in implementing the policy of rectification and adjustment, financial work should pay more attention to increasing revenue and saving, ‘saving’ means using good steel where it is most needed, while ‘increasing revenue’ is an important aspect, which is to find every possible way to increase savings.” The reporter asked the old professor for his opinion, and he firmly answered, “Yes!”

	Feng Dalin pointed out that to further increase savings today, it is necessary to take some practical and effective measures:

	Firstly, reform the low-interest rate policy and implement a floating interest rate. Developing countries, in order to protect the development of their national industries, generally implement a low-interest rate loan policy. However, the results often have two negative effects: one is that the deposit interest rate must also be low, which is not attractive to national savings; the other is that the national industries cultivated in a greenhouse lack international market competitiveness and cannot withstand storms. The situation in China is similar. The low-interest rate on loans is equivalent to the state providing financial subsidies to enterprises, and the total amount may be more than any fiscal subsidy. In this case, if enterprises obtain cheap money—loans, buy raw materials, and store them in the warehouse without producing, they can still make a profit without loss. Moreover, during times of significant price increases, the obviously low deposit interest rate becomes a deep-seated cause of panic buying. Since the 1970s, to combat inflation, the leveraging effect of floating interest rates on savings has been widely recognized by governments around the world.

	Secondly, expand the application scope of value-preserving savings. Last year, the government promptly implemented a 3-year value-preserving savings measure, which played a significant role in mobilizing the enthusiasm of urban and rural individuals for savings. For this reason, and because prices have gradually stabilized, in the first quarter of this year, the country's net withdrawal of currency was 350 million yuan. Recently, many bank employees have called for expanding the application scope of value preservation to one-year and two-year savings. Short-term value preservation is an internationally recognized method for attracting savings. Moreover, the Chinese people have always advocated thrift. As long as the currency does not depreciate unexpectedly, people are unwilling to spend the money they have worked hard to earn casually. Not long ago, the Kunming Bank issued short-term floating interest rate financial bonds, and buyers flocked to purchase them, which is proof of this.

	Thirdly, gradually adopt various measures to attract long-term savings. For example, implementing a retirement security fund system for workers. In the future, a certain proportion of labor insurance funds should be gradually set aside for young and middle-aged workers each year, accumulated by insurance companies and financial institutions, and used to grant loans to enterprises, serving as a security for workers' retirement. Obviously, developing this type of long-term savings is beneficial to both the country and the people. Another example is establishing a higher education savings fund for minors. Each child can gradually save a sum of money before going to college, to be used when they go to college, which also belongs to long-term savings (for those who, for various reasons, cannot receive higher education, the principal and interest can be returned).

	Professor Feng Dalin spoke eloquently and with interest. The reporter asked him to discuss his views on deepening internal reforms within banks to increase savings. He believed that the most fundamental reform for banks is to further promote corporate management, reasonably introduce a competitive mechanism, and improve service attitudes and quality. The current problem is that the system still regards banks at all levels as administrative and public institutions. The business volume has expanded, but the total wage cannot be increased, and the principle of “distribution according to work” cannot be truly reflected, making it difficult to fully mobilize enthusiasm. Feng Dalin talked about the lively situation in the financial sector in recent years—Industrial and Commercial Bank “going to the countryside,” Agricultural Bank “entering the city,” Construction Bank “breaking down walls,” Bank of China “going ashore,” and Communications Bank “connecting everywhere.” The current problem is that there must be a perfect set of competition rules, and no more “interest rate wars” should be fought. Through financial reform, the role of various “treasure pots” in attracting savings should be fully played.

### 紧缩之际贵在开源——冯大麟谈储蓄增长之道

    紧缩之际贵在开源
    ——冯大麟谈储蓄增长之道
    本报记者　董焕亮
    “解决社会建设所需要的资金问题，是靠增发票子，还是靠多吸收社会储蓄。显然，后者是正确的抉择。”年近古稀、鬓发皆白的冯大麟教授快人快语，条分缕析地说明了储蓄增长之道。
    曾任陕西财经学院院长的冯教授，从事教学、科研工作已近四十载。他说，国际经验表明，发展中国家由于金融市场尚不发达，因而储蓄是吸收社会资金的主要渠道，是银行信贷资金的主要来源。我国目前城乡个人储蓄额达4100多亿元，占银行信贷总额的40％；加上政府和企事业单位在银行的存款，各类存款占信贷总额的70％左右。正因为储蓄所占份量如此之重，近年来中央银行、各专业银行都把吸收储蓄作为头等重要的工作，“八仙过海，各显其能。”
    “当前，贯彻实施治理、整顿的方针，看来金融工作更应重视开源节流，‘节流’就是要把好钢用在刀刃上，而‘开源’的一个重要方面，就是要千方百计地增加储蓄。”记者这样向老教授请教，他肯定地答道：“对”！
    冯大麟指出，现今要让储蓄更上一层楼，有必要采取一些切实有效的具体措施：
    首先，要改革低利率政策，实行浮动利率。发展中国家为保护民族工业的发展，一般实行低利率贷款的政策，但执行的结果往往有两方面的副作用：一是存款的利率必然也低，对国民储蓄的吸引力不大；二是温室中培养起来的民族工业缺乏国际市场的竞争力，经不起风雨。我国情况也是如此，贷款的低利率等于国家向企业提供一笔金融补贴，其总额可能比任何一项财政补贴都多。在这种情况下，设若企业争得廉价货币——贷款，买了原材料，放进仓库不生产，也能干赚不赔。而在物价增幅较大时，存款的明显低利率又成为诱发抢购风的深刻原因。自70年代起，为了对付通货膨胀，浮动利率对储蓄的杠杆撬动作用已得到各国政府普遍重视。
    其次，要扩大保值储蓄的应用范围。去年政府及时采取了3年储蓄保值的措施，对调动城乡个人储蓄的积极性起到相当大的作用。由于这个原因，也由于物价渐趋较平稳，今年1季度全国净回笼货币35亿元。最近，很多银行的工作人员呼吁把保值的应用范围扩大到一年、两年储蓄上。短期保值是国际通用的吸纳储蓄的好办法。更何况中华民族历来崇尚勤俭，只要货币不发生意想不到的贬值，人们是不愿把辛苦挣来的钱随随便便花掉的。前不久，昆明市银行发行短期浮动利率金融债券，购者如堵，就是证明。
    再者，可逐步采用多种吸收长期储蓄的措施。比如，实行劳动者退休保障基金制。今后，对青、壮年职工即应逐年提留一定比例的劳动保险基金，由保险公司和金融机构积累起来，转用于向企业发放信贷，并作为劳动者退休后养老的保障。显然，发展这种长期储蓄，既利国，又利民。又如，建立未成年人高等教育储蓄基金。每个孩子上大学前逐年储一笔钱，供上大学时使用，也属于长期储蓄（对因种种原因不能接受高等教育者，可连本带利返还）。
    冯大麟教授侃侃道来，饶有兴味。记者请他再谈谈为增加储蓄，对银行内部深化改革的看法。他认为银行改革最根本的是要进一步企业化经营，合理引进竞争机制，以期改进服务态度，改善服务质量。现在的问题是体制上依然将各级银行视同行政事业单位，业务量扩展了，工资总额不能增加，不能真正体现“按劳分配”的原则，积极性自然难以极大地调动起来。冯大麟谈到金融界近年来出现的活跃局面——工商银行“下乡”，农业银行“进城”，建设银行“拆墙”，中国银行“上岸”，交通银行“四通八达。”现在的问题是必须有一个完善的竞争规则，不可再搞什么“利率大战”，通过金融改革，全面发挥多种“聚宝盆”的吸纳储蓄作用。
