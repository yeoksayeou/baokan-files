    Salvador Guerrillas Refuse to Engage in Dialogue with Government
    Xinhua News Agency, Mexico City, July 2: San Salvador - The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) of El Salvador issued a statement on July 1, refusing to engage in dialogue with a committee proposed by the government.

    Recently, Salvadoran President Cristiani proposed the formation of a committee consisting of government officials, opposition leaders, and other social figures to engage in dialogue with the guerrillas, aiming to explore political solutions to the domestic conflict in El Salvador.

    The guerrilla statement pointed out that since President Cristiani took office on June 1, 67 people have been killed, 80 arrested, and 10 missing, which is sufficient evidence that the government is implementing a reign of terror and has no sincere intention to resolve the domestic conflict peacefully.

    The guerrilla statement said that the dialogue committee proposed by Cristiani is "just a superficial game," "lacking authority, and its members do not represent the government or their respective parties." The statement also revealed that "this game is only to beautify the authorities' repression policies and achieve their propaganda purposes."

    萨游击队拒绝同政府对话
    新华社墨西哥城7月2日电　圣萨尔瓦多消息：萨尔瓦多游击队法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线1日发表声明，拒绝同政府准备成立的委员会进行对话。
    不久前，萨尔瓦多总统克里斯蒂亚尼曾提出，由政府官员、反对党领袖和其他社会人士组成一个委员会来同游击队对话，以探讨政治解决萨尔瓦多国内冲突问题。
    游击队声明指出，自从克里斯蒂亚尼总统6月1日上台以来，全国已有67人遇害，80人被捕，10人失踪，这足以说明政府正在实施恐怖统治，丝毫没有和平解决国内冲突的诚意。
    游击队的声明说，克里斯蒂亚尼要成立的对话委员会“只不过是一种表面游戏”，“没有权威，其成员既不代表政府，也不代表各自的政党”。声明还揭露说，“这种游戏只是为了美化当局的镇压政策和实现其宣传目的而已”。
