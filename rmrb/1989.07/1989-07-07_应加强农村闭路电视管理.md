With the rapid development of socialist commodity economy, people's material living standards are continuously improving, and their spiritual and cultural needs are developing towards higher levels and greater diversity. Many mountainous rural areas, towns, villages, and enterprises and institutions in mountainous rural areas have raised funds to set up antennas and establish small ground receiving stations, operating closed-circuit television systems. This has played an important role in enriching people's cultural life and promoting the development of the education sector. However, due to the lack of a perfect management system for closed-circuit television systems in mountainous rural areas, there are also many problems.

According to the author's knowledge, there are cases where closed-circuit television is used to broadcast low-brow erotic films and fight scenes; there are cases where low-brow entertainment videos are broadcast to attract tourists; there are cases where videos are continuously broadcast until late at night, around 2 or 3 a.m. It has also been discovered that someone stole video tapes and inserted over 10 minutes of sexual scenes, then returned the tapes, and the broadcasting personnel, without checking, broadcasted them on closed-circuit television, causing great surprise and extremely negative effects.

The existence of these problems in self-operated closed-circuit television systems not only negates its role in enriching the cultural life of the masses and spreading socialist spiritual civilization but also affects work and pollutes social customs. It is suggested that relevant departments strengthen management to prevent similar incidents from happening.

    应加强农村闭路电视管理
    随着社会主义商品经济的迅速发展，人们的物质生活水平不断提高，精神文化需求也向高层次、多样化发展。不少山区农村的乡、镇、村和在山区农村的企事业单位筹集资金，架设天线，设立小型地面接收站，办起了闭路电视系统。这对于活跃人们的文化生活、促进教育事业的发展发挥了重要作用。但是由于山区农村的闭路电视系统没有完善的管理制度，存在的问题也不少。
    据笔者所知，利用闭路电视播放格调低下的色情片、打斗片的有之；以播放低级趣味录像来招徕旅客的有之；连续播放录像片至深夜二三时的有之。还发现有人盗走录像片，在片子中翻录了长达10多分钟性动作的镜头，尔后“物归原主”，播放人员未经审查，便在闭路电视中播放，众皆愕然，造成极其不良的影响。
    自办闭路电视系统存在的这些方面的问题不仅失去了它活跃群众文化生活、传播社会主义精神文明的作用，而且影响了工作，污染了社会风气。建议有关部门加强管理，杜绝类似现象发生。　福建省顺昌县公安局　林永祥
