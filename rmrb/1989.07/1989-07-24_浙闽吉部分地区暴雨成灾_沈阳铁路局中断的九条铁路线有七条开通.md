Heavy rain causes flooding in parts of Zhejiang and Fujian

	According to the National Flood Control Headquarters Office, heavy rains have affected parts of Zhejiang and Fujian provinces due to the impact of the 9th typhoon this year. Some areas have already been severely affected.

	It is reported that from July 20th to 23rd, the central, eastern, and southern parts of Zhejiang, as well as the northern part of Fujian, experienced heavy rainfall. Currently, 14 counties in Zhejiang have 1.3 million acres of farmland submerged, 28 people have died, 21 are missing, and nearly 50,000 houses have been damaged. The water level of the Songxi River, a tributary of the Minjiang River in Fujian, has exceeded the danger level. The main leaders of both provinces have rushed to the disaster areas to direct flood control and rescue efforts.

Heavy rain continues to batter Jilin, causing severe flooding

	According to Xinhua News Agency, heavy rain and storms continue to hit most parts of Jilin Province, causing floods that have resulted in at least 63 deaths and 15 missing in Jiahe, Shulan, Gongzhuling, and Yitong counties and cities. The Laba and Changtu railways remain closed; the Jingha Railway, which had been running at a limited speed after emergency repairs, was forced to suspend operations again at 12:15 due to rising floodwaters exceeding the track bed. According to incomplete statistics from the provincial flood control headquarters at 14:00 today for the eight severely affected counties and cities, the number of affected people has risen to 1.23 million, 4.15 million acres of farmland have been affected, 74 villages and towns are surrounded by water, and more than 11,000 houses have collapsed.

	The severe water damage suffered by the Shenyang Railway Bureau is the second of its kind since 1959. On July 8th, the Dandong Branch in Fengcheng City received 242 millimeters of rain in 24 hours, causing the Shenyang-Dandong line to be suspended; on the 19th, the Tonghua Branch in Lianjiang City experienced a landslide due to heavy rain, with a large amount of mud and rocks burying the tracks, causing the Yayan-Dazhizi line to be suspended; on the 22nd, the public station of the Changda main line was submerged, with water depths exceeding the track surface by 800 millimeters, causing train operations to be suspended.

    浙闽吉部分地区暴雨成灾
    沈阳铁路局中断的九条铁路线有七条开通
    新华社北京7月24日电　（通讯员袁建军）据国家防汛总指挥部办公室今天提供的情况，受今年第9号台风影响，浙江、福建两省部分地区近日连降暴雨，局部地区已经成灾。
    据介绍，7月20日至23日，浙江的中部、东部、南部以及福建的北部地区普降暴雨。浙江省有14个县目前已有130万亩农田受淹，死亡28人，失踪21人，损坏房屋近5万间。福建省闽江支流松溪水位超出危险水位。目前两省主要领导同志均已赶赴灾区，指挥抗洪抢险。
    据新华社长春7月24日18时电　（记者周长庆）大雨暴雨继续袭击吉林省大部分地区，水灾已使蛟河、舒兰、公主岭、伊通等8个县市至少有63人死亡，15人失踪。拉滨、长图铁路仍未开通；京哈铁路经抢修维持一段时间的限速运行后，又因洪水上涨超过路基，被迫于12时15分中断运行。据省防汛指挥部今天14时对8个重灾县市的不完全统计，受灾人口增至123万，受灾农田415万多亩，被水围困村屯74个，倒塌房屋11000多间。
    新华社沈阳7月24日电　（通讯员孟军、高文江）沈阳铁路局近日因暴雨灾害而中断的9条铁路线，到今天中午已有7条全部开通。
    沈阳铁路局遭受的这次特大水害，是自1959年以来的第二次。7月8日，丹东分局凤凰城地区24小时之内降雨达242毫米，致使沈阳丹东线中断；19日，通化分局临江地区因降暴雨，发生山体滑坡，大量泥石流淹没线路，造成鸭园——大栗子铁路线中断；22日，长大干线的公主岭车站一片汪洋，水深高出轨面800毫米，造成行车中断，沈阳铁路局和长春、吉林、丹东、通化等分局领导立即赶赴现场指挥抢险。
