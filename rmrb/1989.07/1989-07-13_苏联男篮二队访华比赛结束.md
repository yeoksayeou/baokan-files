Tonight, the Chinese youth team played exceptionally well, especially in the first half when they dominated for the first twelve minutes, trailing by only 38 to 43 at halftime. In the second half, the Chinese youth team continued to play aggressively, tying the score at 50, 60, and 62 within the first seven minutes.

    苏联男篮二队访华比赛结束
    新华社北京七月十二日电　（记者王道源）苏联国家男篮二队今晚在北京大学生体育馆，以九十比七十六胜中国青年男篮。这是客队最后一场访华比赛。客队自六月二十九日访华以来，先后在唐山、呼和浩特、北京同中国国家队、青年队共进行八场友谊比赛，战绩为五胜三负。
    今晚中国青年队打得极为出色，尤其在上半时前十二分钟内，几乎一直压着对方，上半时结束时仅以三十八比四十三落后。下半时一开始，中国青年队仍打得虎虎有生气，七分钟内先后把比分追成五十平、六十平和六十二平。
