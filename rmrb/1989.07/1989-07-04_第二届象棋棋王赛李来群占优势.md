The renowned chess player from Hebei, Li Laiqun, defeated Zhao Ruquan from Hong Kong using the "Giant Python Coiling Technique," maintaining his lead with 7 points after the first four rounds of the Second Chess King Tournament. Xu Tianhong from Jiangsu is closely following with 2 points behind.

Local experts believe that as the Second Chess King Tournament reaches its halfway point, the situation is becoming clearer. Li Laiqun (7 points), Xu Tianhong (5 points), and Wu Guilin (4 points) are likely to secure the right to challenge the previous year's champion. Among them, Li Laiqun has the highest hopes, needing only one win and one draw in the remaining three rounds to achieve his goal. Xu Tianhong and Wu Guilin, however, have two tough matches ahead: either facing Li and Wu or Xu and Zhao. Experts also anticipate that the remaining three rounds will be even more intense, possibly leading to a "chain reaction" scenario.

    第二届象棋棋王赛李来群占优势
    本报哈尔滨7月4日电  河北名将李来群以巨蟒缠身术战胜香港赵汝权，从而在第二届象棋棋王赛前4轮较量中，以积7分的优势继续保持领先地位，江苏徐天红以2分之差紧追不舍。
    此间行家认为：第二届象棋棋王赛赛程过半，形势日趋明朗。李来群（7分）、徐天红（5分）和吴贵临（4分）有望夺得向上届棋王挑战权。其中李来群希望最大，他只要在后3轮比赛中取得一胜一和成绩即可如愿。而徐天红和吴贵临都有两场硬仗：过李吴关卡或徐赵关隘。行家们也估计到后3轮比赛会更趋激烈，可能出现“连环套”局面。
