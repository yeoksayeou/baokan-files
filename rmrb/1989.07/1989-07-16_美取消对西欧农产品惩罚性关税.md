The U.S. cancels punitive tariffs on Western European agricultural products

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 14

	The U.S. has decided to cancel the punitive tariffs it imposed on ham and other agricultural products exported from Western Europe, following a limited resumption of trade between the U.S. and Western Europe this month.

	U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter announced this decision today, stating that the trade dispute between the U.S. and the European Community over hormone-treated meat earlier this year has created opportunities for the resumption of trade between the two sides.

	At the beginning of this year, the U.S. retaliated against the European Community's decision to ban the import of all American meat products containing hormones by imposing a 100 percent tariff on ham, beef, instant coffee, and animal feed exported from the European Community to the U.S.

	In May, both sides reached a temporary agreement: the U.S. could export some hormone-free meat products to Western Europe, and in return, the European Community would reduce tariffs on products exported to the U.S. in proportion to the amount of meat exported.

	U.S. officials emphasized that the growth hormones used in the U.S. pose no danger to human health, and that the European Community's accusations lack scientific evidence.

	Yeutter said that continued discussions on this issue would enable both sides to fully resume trade.

    美取消对西欧农产品惩罚性关税
    新华社华盛顿7月14日电  由于美国和西欧本月有限度地恢复了双方的贸易，美国决定取消对西欧出口的火腿和其他农产品实行的惩罚性关税。
    美国贸易代表希尔斯今天在宣布这一决定时说，美国与欧洲共同体今年初就含荷尔蒙的肉类进行的贸易争论为恢复双方贸易创造了机会。
    今年年初，美国曾对欧共体决定禁止进口美国任何含有荷尔蒙的肉类产品实行报复，对欧共体向美国出口的火腿、牛肉、速溶咖啡和动物食品等征收百分之百的关税。
    今年5月，双方曾达成一项临时性计划：美国可向西欧出口一些不含荷尔蒙的肉类产品，同时按照上述肉类出口量的比例减少西欧对美出口产品的关税。
    美国官员强调，美国使用的生长性荷尔蒙对人体没有危险；欧共体的指责缺少科学证据。
    希尔斯说，双方继续就这一问题进行讨论，将能使双方的贸易得以全面恢复。
