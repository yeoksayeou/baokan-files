People's Daily, Changsha, July 20th, Reporter Wu Xinghua reports: Vice Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and Governor Chen Bangzhu today severely criticized corruption in provincial departments at a meeting of provincial department cadres. He said that corruption exists to varying degrees in some units of provincial departments, and some problems are quite serious, even showing a trend of development. A small number of people have already degenerated into corrupt elements.

Chen Bangzhu enumerated various manifestations of corruption:

First, public funds are used for banquets and gifts, resulting in severe waste. Some people use necessary receptions and hospitality as an excuse to squander public funds on lavish feasts, often costing hundreds or even thousands of yuan per meal. The phenomenon of using public funds to give gifts is also widespread. The Provincial Taxation Bureau, during the evaluation of intermediate technical titles, had Deputy Directors Yang Baqiu and Li Li lead a team to "work on-site" in 13 cities and prefectures. The 16-person team squandered 840,000 yuan of public funds along the way. They stayed in high-end hotels, with the highest accommodation fee reaching 300 yuan per night for one person, and even stayed in hotels in Changsha, with daily accommodation fees reaching 180 yuan. They almost always accepted banquets, sometimes drinking Maotai wine that costs hundreds of yuan per bottle, and smoking imported cigarettes that cost over 70 yuan per pack. The food and reception fees alone amounted to over 400,000 yuan, and they also accepted gifts worth nearly 100,000 yuan, including blankets and wool fabrics, from various places.

Second, there are serious violations of financial discipline. The Provincial Audit Bureau has audited 78 units over the past year, uncovering various types of disciplinary violations totaling 12.93 million yuan. The Provincial Audit Bureau sampled 20 units, finding that 1.01 million yuan in cash and goods were improperly distributed. The Provincial Water Resources and Electric Power Department illegally used 300,000 yuan in special funds last October to build a director's dormitory.

Third, some party and government agencies are engaged in business and running companies. Some companies use their power and connections to demand scarce materials from enterprises for resale, while others use the pretext of donations from overseas Chinese to obtain import permits for scarce materials, reselling the permits for profit. In reality, they collude with Hong Kong merchants to evade customs supervision and engage in smuggling.

Last year, the Changsha Customs intercepted 9 such cases of fake donations and real smuggling, with illegal profits from reselling permits totaling 3.138 million yuan. Some engage in buying and selling nothing, indulging in extravagance and waste, causing significant losses to the state.

Fourth, using their power, some engage in power-for-money exchanges; some openly accept or demand cash and even gold jewelry and other valuable items. The procuratorial organs have investigated and prosecuted 53 economic crime cases in provincial departments over the past year, including 28 cases of soliciting and accepting bribes. Seven officials from the Provincial Press and Publication Bureau used their supervisory or construction management roles to accept bribes totaling over 130,000 yuan. Li Jun, an accountant from the Provincial Construction Bank's Financial Department, used his position to lend money to enterprises and individuals, soliciting and accepting bribes totaling 16,000 yuan. Yi Mingqin, a responsible person from the Provincial Three Electric Office, used his power to allocate electricity and accepted 5,000 Hong Kong dollars from a certain factory.

Chen Bangzhu, on behalf of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, announced at the meeting that immediate action should be taken to launch an anti-corruption campaign in provincial departments.

    省长陈邦柱在干部会上强调
    湖南反腐败从省直抓起
    本报长沙7月20日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省委副书记、省长陈邦柱今天在省直机关干部会上严厉批评省直机关腐败现象。他说，腐败现象在省直机关的一些单位不同程度地存在，有的问题相当严重，甚至还有发展的趋势，极少数人已经堕落成腐败分子。
    陈邦柱历数腐败现象种种表现：
    一是公款请客送礼，挥霍浪费严重。少数人以必要的招待应酬为借口，用公款大吃大喝，动不动几百元、甚至上千元一席。用公款送礼物的现象也带有普遍性。省税务局在评审中级技术职称中，由副局长杨保秋、李立带队，到13个地市“现场办公”。一行16人，一路挥霍公款8.4万元。他们住高级宾馆，住宿费最高的一人竟达300元一晚，甚至在长沙也住宾馆，每天住宿费高达180元。几乎天天接受宴请，有时喝上百元一瓶的茅台酒，抽70多元一条的进口香烟，伙食费和招待费就花了4万多元，还接受了各地价值近万元的毛毯、毛料等礼品。
    二是严重违反财经纪律。省审计局去年以来审计了78个单位，查出各类违纪金额1293万元。省审计局抽查20个单位，滥发钱物达101万元。省水利水电厅去年10月擅自动用专项经费30万元，修建处长宿舍。
    三是有些党政机关经商、办公司。有的公司利用权力和关系，向企业索要紧俏物资转手倒卖，有的以华侨捐赠为名，骗取紧俏物资的进口许可证，倒卖批文，从中牟利，实际上是勾结港商，逃避海关监督，进行走私。
    去年，长沙海关查获这样的假捐赠真走私的批文9起，倒卖批文非法牟利313.8万元。还有的买空卖空，奢侈挥霍，使国家遭受重大损失。
    四是利用手中权力，大搞权钱交易；有的公然接受、索要现金以至金首饰等贵重物品。检察部门去年以来立案查处了省直机关经济犯罪案件53件，其中索贿受贿案件28件。省新闻出版局7名干部，利用主管或经营基建之便，受贿索贿金额达13万多元。省建设银行财务处会计李军，利用职权，为企业、个体户贷款，索贿受贿1.6万元。省三电办负责人易明钦利用手中分配电力的职权，接受某厂的港币5000元。
    陈邦柱同志代表省委、省政府在会上宣布，立即行动起来，在省直机关开展一场反腐败的斗争。
