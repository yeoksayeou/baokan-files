Title: Elephants to Disappear from the "Ivory Coast"

The Ivory Coast, formerly known as Côte d'Ivoire, got its name from French explorers who found thousands of elephant skeletons in a cave and made a fortune from the ivory. This West African nation has since been closely associated with elephants: the national emblem features an elephant, the most luxurious hotel in the capital, Abidjan, is called the "Ivory Hotel," the only evening newspaper is named the "Ivory Evening News," and even the national football team is called the "Elephants."

Unfortunately, the elephants that Côte d'Ivoire has long taken pride in are now facing extinction. The environmental protection department has issued a warning: "By 1995, Côte d'Ivoire may have no elephants left!"

According to a recent report by the "Humanité Matin," there were over 100,000 elephants in Côte d'Ivoire in 1950. Due to rampant poaching, the number had dropped to 5,000 by 1980, and now it is less than 1,500. If the current rate of decline continues, elephants will soon disappear from this region. At that point, children will only be able to see elephants in zoos or recognize them from photographs and television. The main reasons for the drastic decline in the elephant population are the shrinking of the dense, humid tropical forests they depend on for survival and the large-scale poaching by hunters. To raise public awareness about protecting this precious animal, environmental organizations have launched a nationwide "Pardon the Elephants" campaign.

There are still about one million African elephants, but approximately 100,000 are killed each year. The annual export of ivory is about 800 tons, mostly illegally smuggled to Europe, Asia, and the United States. Recently, countries like France, the United States, West Germany, and Japan have all made decisions to ban the import of ivory. However, the ivory trade remains active, and poaching activities are on the rise. It seems that the plight of African elephants is difficult to avoid.

### 大象将从“象牙海岸”消失

    大象将从“象牙海岸”消失
    本报记者　杨汝生
    科特迪瓦以前的国名叫“象牙海岸”。据说，当年法国探险家在此地登陆，从一座洞穴中发现了成千具大象尸骨而发了大财，遂将该地称为“象牙海岸”。从此，这个西非国家便与大象结下了不解之缘：国徽上的主要标志是大象，首都阿比让最豪华的宾馆叫“象牙旅馆”，当地唯一的晚报叫《象牙晚报》，连国家的足球队也叫“大象队”……
    可惜，科特迪瓦人长期引以为荣的大象现在却正面临灭顶之灾。环境保护部门已经发出警告：“到一九九五年，科特迪瓦可能就没有大象了！”
    据《博爱晨报》最近报道，一九五○年科全国还有大象十万余头，由于滥肆捕杀，到了一九八○年只剩下五千头，现在则不到一千五百头了。若是照目前的速度继续减少下去，用不了几年，这里的大象就会绝迹。到那时，孩子们只能到动物园里，或只能从照片上和电视里去辨认这种庞然大物了。大象急剧减少的主要原因是，这种动物赖以生存的茂密潮湿的热带森林日趋缩小和偷猎者大量捕杀。为了唤起民众保护这种珍贵动物，环保组织再次在全国范围内发起了“赦免大象”的运动。
    非洲大象现在还有一百万头，每年约有十万头被杀，象牙年出口量约计八百吨，主要被非法贩运到欧洲、亚洲和美国。最近，法国、美国、西德和日本等虽都相继作出禁止象牙进口的决定，但是，象牙贸易仍很活跃，偷猎活动有增无减。看来，非洲大象的厄运很难避免。
