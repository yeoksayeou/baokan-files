Heilongjiang punishes 7 provincial-level officials, 4 arrested for bribery and speculation

BEIJING, July 8 -- The Heilongjiang Provincial Committee and Government have taken concrete actions to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, cracking down on party discipline and government conduct. On July 8, they held a public meeting to handle seven provincial-level officials who had violated laws and disciplines.

These seven provincial-level officials either abused their power for personal gain, took bribes, embezzled public funds, engaged in corruption, or exploited loopholes in the reform and dual-pricing system to speculate and defraud.

Yao Zhiyu, Deputy Director of the Basic Construction Bureau of the Northeast Inner Mongolia Coal Industry Corporation, took advantage of his position to receive kickbacks from construction contractors twice, totaling 20,000 yuan, and was expelled from the Party, removed from his position, and handed over to judicial authorities for legal punishment.

Guan Wenbin, Deputy Director of the Enterprise Management Consulting Committee and Manager of the Senior Citizens Service Company of the Daqing Petrochemical Company, formerly Deputy Director of the Daqing Petrochemical Company, took advantage of his position to help others purchase benzene, high-pressure polyethylene, and petroleum coke from May to August 1988, and received bribes totaling 27,000 yuan. He was expelled from the Party, removed from his vice-ministerial position, and handed over to judicial authorities for legal punishment.

The public handling of these seven law-breaking and discipline-violating provincial-level officials has boosted the morale of the Party and the people.

    黑龙江惩处7名厅局级干部
    其中4人因倒卖受贿被依法逮捕
    本报哈尔滨7月8日电  黑龙江省委、省政府以实际行动认真贯彻十三届四中全会精神，狠抓党风、政风建设，于7月8日召开公开处理七名违法乱纪的厅局级干部大会。
    这七名厅局级干部有的以权谋私、索贿受贿，有的贪赃枉法、腐化堕落，还有的钻改革和两种价格的空子，投机诈骗，倒买倒卖。
    东北内蒙古煤炭工业联合公司基本建设局副局长姚志武，利用主管基建工作之便，先后两次收受基建工程承包单位“回扣费”2万元，中饱私囊，被开除党籍，撤销副局长职务，交司法机关依法惩处。
    大庆石油化工总厂企业管理咨询委员会副主任、老年人服务公司经理、原大庆石油化工总厂副厂长关文彬，利用职务之便，于1988年5月至8月间，帮助他人购买纯苯、高压聚乙烯、石油焦等石化产品，供他人投机倒把，先后5次收受索取贿赂2.7万元，被开除党籍、撤销副厅级职务，交司法机关依法惩处。
    公开处理七名违法乱纪厅局级干部，党心民心为之振奋。
