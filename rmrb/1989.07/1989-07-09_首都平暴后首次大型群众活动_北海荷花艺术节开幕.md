The first major public event in the capital after the crackdown, the Lotus Art Festival at Beihai Park, opened today.

The Lotus Art Festival at Beihai Park is jointly organized by relevant departments of Beijing, the China Floriculture Association, and the Lantern Festival Office of Chengdu, Sichuan. The dazzling lanterns from Chengdu are rich in local flavor and folk charm. The entire exhibition area covers 68 hectares and is divided into five lantern zones, each with relatively independent content but all mutually complementary and enhancing each other.

At night, as visitors stroll through Beihai Park, they see a rainbow arching over Yong'an Bridge, the front of Jiongdong Island ablaze with lights, and the "White Pagoda Lotus Platform" elevated high, with colorful lights shining in all directions, majestic and grand. The water is dotted with lights, and the "Rising China" lantern soars into the clouds, leaving visitors in awe. The "Golden Dragon" emerges from the water, dancing around the "White Pagoda Lotus Platform," giving the impression of soaring through the clouds. Truly, the entire park is filled with lights and people, the sky and water blending together, and laughter fills the air.

According to a responsible comrade from the Lotus Art Festival Command Center, this year's festival is the first large-scale public event organized in Beijing after the suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and it will conclude on August 31.

At night, visitors stroll through Beihai Park, enjoying the cool breeze, viewing the lanterns, appreciating the flowers, and cooling off, feeling refreshed and at ease.

    首都平暴后首次大型群众活动
    北海荷花艺术节开幕
    本报北京7月9日讯　记者徐建中报道：“北海荷花艺术节”今天拉开了序幕。
    北海荷花艺术节是由北京市有关部门、中国花卉协会和四川成都市灯会办公室共同举办的。这些来自成都的璀璨彩灯具有浓郁的地方色彩和民间乡土气息。整个展区共占地68公顷，分5个灯区，每个灯区的内容都相对独立，但又相互呼应，相互烘托。
    入夜，观众漫步北海公园，只见永安桥上彩虹飞跨，琼岛正面灯火辉煌，“白塔莲台”被高高托起，彩光四射，雄伟壮观。水中灯光粼粼，“中华腾飞”高耸入云，令人赞叹。“金龙”出水，“龙飞凤舞”，围绕“白塔莲台”旋转，又给人以腾云缥缈之感。真可谓满园灯光满园游人，天水紧相连，一片欢笑声。
    据北海荷花艺术节指挥部负责同志介绍，本届荷花艺术节是制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱后在北京第一次组织的大型群众性活动，将在8月31日结束。（附图片）
    入夜，游人漫步北海公园，迎着习习凉风，观灯、赏花、纳凉，不禁心旷神怡。
