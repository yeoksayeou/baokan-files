The usual bustle and noise of Cairo are absent during the Feast of Sacrifice. Instead, it is a time for sheep and children to take over the city.

Before the 10th day of the Islamic month of Dhu al-Hijjah (July 13 this year), flocks of sheep begin to pour into the city. A makeshift market can be set up at any street corner with a feeding trough. The sheep owners busy themselves grooming their animals, washing the wool clean with water and a brush, and marking the hindquarters with a bright red stamp. Children gather around these docile "friends," pulling, riding, and playing with them.

As the name suggests, the Feast of Sacrifice involves the ritual slaughter of sheep. Cairo, known as the "City of a Thousand Minarets," starts to stir at around 4:30 AM. Families gather at open spaces in front of mosques for morning prayers as the sky begins to lighten. The sight is awe-inspiring, with thousands of people participating.

Children, however, are more interested in watching the sheep being slaughtered and riding decorated carriages.

The ritual of slaughtering the sheep is quite elaborate. A canopy is set up around the slaughtering area, and basins and pots for cleaning the offal are neatly arranged. The butcher must be skilled; he gives the sheep a drink of water, then swiftly cuts its throat with a sharp knife. In an instant, the sheep's head falls to the ground. Onlookers recite verses from the Quran or pray for a bountiful year.

The meat from the Feast of Sacrifice is always fresh and tender, as it is slaughtered and eaten on the same day. However, not everyone can afford to buy a sheep. This morning, the reporter visited several sheep markets. A small sheep costs around 250 Egyptian pounds (approximately 380 Chinese yuan), while a slightly larger one costs at least 350 Egyptian pounds. For middle and lower-income families with a monthly income of 80 Egyptian pounds, buying a whole sheep is out of reach. Children might get to taste a piece (1 kilogram for 12 Egyptian pounds, approximately 20 Chinese yuan).

The Cairo municipal government acknowledges that sheep prices have been rising in recent years. Statistics show that per capita meat consumption in Egypt has decreased from 11 kilograms in 1984 to 9 kilograms. However, according to Islamic tradition, wealthy people who slaughter sheep are expected to share the meat with poor relatives and neighbors. This custom still prevails, ensuring that more people get to taste sheep meat during the festival.

After eating the sheep meat, half of the festival is over. The remaining three days of public holiday are essentially "Children's Days." Children dress in new clothes, visit parks, swing, ride in carriages, and eat ice cream. In Cairo, children particularly enjoy riding small bicycles decorated with colorful paper flowers, known as "flower bikes." In Egypt, bicycles are not typically used as a means of transportation, but on this day, they become the children's favorite playthings. Watching the fast-moving bikes weave in and out of traffic is both exciting and nerve-wracking, but the children are overjoyed.

Near the Tahrir Mosque, in one of Cairo's older districts where many middle and lower-income families live, flower bikes are less common. A reporter's friend asked a 12-year-old boy, "What is your wish for the festival?" The boy replied, "I want to deliver more newspapers so I can earn enough money to buy my sister some candy for the festival." The boy's innocent words stirred many thoughts...

This morning, the reporter called an elderly Chinese immigrant in Cairo to wish him a happy festival. The old gentleman enthusiastically recounted the festival's origins. "Long ago, Allah tested Ibrahim's faith by dreaming that he should sacrifice his son. Ibrahim was truly about to kill his eldest son, Ismail. The first strike of the knife, the blade bent; the second strike, the blade bent again. Allah decided to replace the child with a sheep as the sacrifice..."

It turns out that the Feast of Sacrifice has been associated with sheep and children since ancient times.

### 开罗宰牲节

    开罗宰牲节
    本报记者　林皎明
    不见平日恼人的繁杂，不闻寻常市井的喧嚣，宰牲节的开罗是绵羊和孩子们的天下。
    伊斯兰教历12月10日（即今年公历7月13日）还没到，前呼后拥的羊群便络绎不绝地进城。随便一个街角，架起食槽，卖羊市场就算开张了。羊主人忙着给羊打扮，用清水和刷子把羊毛洗得白白净净，在后臀上打上一个艳红的印记。城里孩子围着这群总也惹不恼的“朋友”，又拉又骑又打。
    顾名思义，宰牲节就是杀羊过节。素有千塔之都美誉的开罗今晨4点多就闹腾起来了。家家户户趁天边刚刚露出鱼肚白，就赶到清真寺前的空场上作节日礼拜。噢，那可有万人空巷的壮景。
    孩子对祈祷不感兴趣，心里急着看宰羊和骑花车。
    宰羊可大有讲究。屠场四周要搭彩棚，收拾下水的盆盆罐罐摆放得当。屠夫必是好手，先给羊灌一口水，操起利刀，眨眼功夫，羊头已经落地……围观的人有念古兰经的，有祈祷来年风调雨顺的。
    宰牲节的羊肉哪有不鲜不嫩的？现宰现吃嘛。可并不见得所有的人买得起羊。记者今晨驱车逛了四五个羊市。1只不大的绵羊起价250埃镑（约合人民币380元），稍肥实一点的不下350埃镑。月工资80埃镑的中下层市民多数不敢独家问津，孩子闹着吃，买一块尝尝还行（1公斤12埃镑，约合20元人民币）。
    开罗市政府也不否认，近年来羊肉价扶摇直上。据统计，埃及目前人均肉类消费已从1984年的11公斤下降到9公斤。不过，伊斯兰教有规矩，有钱人宰羊，要分送穷亲戚和左邻右舍。遗风尚在，过节尝过羊肉味的人自然要多一些。
    吃罢羊肉，节就算过了一半。剩下3天公假，其实就是“儿童节”。穿新鞋，着新褂，逛公园，打秋千，坐马车，吃冰糕，这都不算，开罗的孩子最喜欢骑轮子上扎着五颜六色纸花的小自行车。俗称骑花车。自行车在埃及本算不上交通工具，今天倒成了孩子们的节日宠物。瞧吧，飞快的小车在马路口闪进闪出，真叫人捏把汗，可孩子们乐得欢。
    土伦清真寺附近，是开罗老区，中下层市民居多。花车在那里就不多见了。记者的朋友问一个12岁的孩子，“你过节的愿望是什么？”男孩说，“我想多送几张报纸，用多挣的钱给妹妹买一块糖过节”。童言无忌，勾起人们许多联想……
    今晨，记者打电话给开罗1位老华侨祝贺节日，这位老先生侃侃谈起节日由来。“从前，安拉要考验伊卜拉欣的忠诚，托梦令他杀子。伊卜拉欣果真要亲手杀死长子伊斯梅尔。第1刀下去，刀口卷刃，第2刀下去，刀口又卷刃。安拉决定用羊代替儿童作牺牲……”
    原来宰牲节自古就与绵羊和孩子联系在一起。
