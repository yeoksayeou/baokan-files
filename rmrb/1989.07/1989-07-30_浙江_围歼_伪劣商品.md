In April of this year, in Lucheng County's Liushui Town in Zhejiang Province, more than 1,000 boxes of substandard electrical appliances, valued at over 1 million yuan, were crushed to pieces by a road roller. This incident shocked the electrical appliance producers and dealers throughout the province.

This was just one scene from the recent "wipe-out" campaign launched by the industrial and commercial bureaus across Zhejiang against the producers and dealers of counterfeit and substandard goods.

In this new "wipe-out" campaign, Zhejiang Province inspected 15,000 enterprises and individual businesses, checked 489 markets, handled 1,454 cases, and seized a large number of fake trademarks, fake monosodium glutamate, fake fish meal, fake brand-name bicycles, and substandard leather shoes. In Huangyan, industrial and commercial officials seized more than 2.9 million sets of fake Xi Feng liquor trademarks from a printing factory. The industrial and commercial bureaus of Hangzhou and Xiaoshan City also uncovered several illegal assembly and sales points for "Rizhi" refrigerators.

According to officials from the industrial and commercial management department, they have dealt with these producers and sellers of counterfeit and substandard goods many times before. Often, after being punished, they would repeat their offenses multiple times. Last year alone, the Lucheng industrial and commercial bureau organized 15 large-scale actions, mobilizing more than 600 people to inspect over 300 enterprises that manufactured and sold low-voltage electrical appliances, and destroyed substandard and counterfeit electrical appliances valued at 450,000 yuan.

    浙江“围歼”伪劣商品
    据新华社杭州7月30日电（记者林楠）今年4月，在浙江省乐清县柳市镇上，有1000多箱标价总值为100余万元的劣质电器，被一台压路机碾得粉碎。此事引起全省电器生产经营户的震动。
    这是近几个月来，浙江各地工商局对假冒伪劣商品的生产和经营者发起“围歼”的一个镜头。
    在这次新的“围歼”中，浙江省共检查企业、个体户1.5万户，检查市场489个，查处案件1454件，查获大批假商标、假味精、假鱼粉、假名牌自行车、劣质皮鞋等商品。在黄岩一家印刷厂，工商人员查获290多万套西凤酒假商标。杭州、萧山市工商局还查获几个“日芝”电冰箱的非法组装销售厂点。
    据工商管理部门的干部介绍，他们与这些假冒伪劣商品的生产者和销售者交手，绝大多数不是头一回了。往往查处之后又犯，反复多次。仅去年，乐清工商局就曾组织过15次大规模行动，出动600多人次，对300余家制造销售低压电器的企业进行检查，销毁标价45万余元的假冒劣质电器。
