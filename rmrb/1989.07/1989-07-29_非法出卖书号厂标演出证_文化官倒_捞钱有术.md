The widely despised phenomenon of "official profiteering" is not only prevalent in the economic sphere but also in the cultural sector. Selling ISBNs, factory labels, and performance certificates are just a few examples.

At a time when many scholarly works struggle to find a publisher and cannot be published, low-quality and vulgar publications can be found in bookstores across cities and towns. These publications proudly display the names of state-owned publishers, complete with editors, proofreaders, and ISBNs, and are not classified as "illegal publications." According to insiders, some of these publications are handled by individual merchants from manuscript composition to editing, publishing, and distribution, without the publisher's involvement, yet the publisher still reaps the benefits. The secret lies in the buying and selling of ISBNs. A bookstall owner with tens of thousands of yuan in savings told a reporter, "Selling books only earns a few cents a day, but publishing a book with an ISBN can earn tens of thousands if done well."

The buying and selling of ISBNs has become an open secret.

This phenomenon of widespread buying and selling is not limited to the publishing industry. Just like customers buying goods in a store, as long as one is willing to pay, one can also buy film studio labels, television drama shooting quotas, audio cassette numbers, and business performance certificates, although such transactions are usually not openly priced, and both parties understand each other tacitly.

According to regulations, only 16 film studios under the central government have the right to produce feature films. If local studios want to produce films, they have to pay hundreds of thousands of yuan to one of these studios, thus obtaining the label of being produced by or co-produced with a major studio, and can then submit the film for review and approval by relevant departments.

As for the price of performance certificates, it depends on the level of the performing group and the duration of use, ranging from a few thousand yuan to a few hundred yuan, with no fixed price. It is understood that buying a box number for a traditional opera audio cassette generally costs 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, for a music cassette about 4,000 yuan, and for a song cassette 5,000 to 8,000 yuan, with popular songs being the most expensive.

    非法出卖书号厂标演出证
  “文化官倒”捞钱有术
    万民痛恨的“官倒”现象，不仅经济界有，文化界也有，卖书号、厂标、演出证等，便是其中几例。
    在许多学术著作求告无门，难以问世的同时，一些低级、庸俗的出版物却能在遍布城乡的书摊上粉墨登场。它们堂而皇之地冠有国家正式出版社出版的字样，责编、校对、书号等样样齐全，绝不属于“非法书刊”之列。据知情者介绍，这类出版物中，有的从组稿、编辑到出版、发行均由与此行当无干系的个体商操持，出版社无需染指，便能坐收渔利。其奥妙在于买卖书号。一名腰缠数十万贯的个体书摊主对记者说：“卖书一天才赚几文，搞个书号出本书，闹好了就捞几十方（万）。”
    买卖书号已成了公开的秘密。
    买卖成风的现象不仅出版界有，就像顾客进商店买商品一样，只要肯花钱，还可买到电影制片厂的厂标，电视剧的拍摄指标，音像带的盒号，营业性演出证等等，只是这种买卖通常不明码标价，主顾双方心照不宣。
    按有关规定，只有中央所属的16家电影制片厂有权拍摄故事片，如果地方厂家想要拍，就得忍痛向其中的某一家交出几十万元，这样便可打上某某大厂拍摄或与某某大厂合拍的字幕，并得以送交有关部门审查通过。
    至于演出证的价格，得看演出团体的档次和用证时间，有的千把元，有的百把元，随行就市没个准。据了解，买一个戏曲录音带的盒号一般为1000—2000元，音乐带为4000元左右，歌曲带为5000—8000元，歌曲带中以通俗歌曲价最高。
