To celebrate the 62nd anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, the first soldier singer competition of the entire army kicked off today at the Navy Hall in Beijing.

The 122 singers participating in the competition come from 14 major units of the entire army. They are outstanding performers selected from the army-wide mass singing activities. Most of the songs they perform are about praising the Party, the people's army, the People's Republic, and the achievements of the Four Modernizations. Relevant officials told the reporter that this competition is a review of the army's mass vocal art creation and performance, as well as an exchange activity on the army's amateur music stage. Participants include both military personnel and military academy students.

The competition, organized by the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army, features three types of singing styles: folk, classical, and popular. Famous artists from both inside and outside the military, including Li Wei, Shi Le Meng, Shen Yawei, Ma Yu Tao, Jin Tie Lin, Wang Ming, Wang Shi Guang, and Guo Shu Zhen, serve as judges.
