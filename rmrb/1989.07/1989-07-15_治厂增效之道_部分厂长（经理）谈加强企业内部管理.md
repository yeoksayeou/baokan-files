In the process of rectification and deepening reforms, enterprises are facing difficulties such as shortages of funds, raw materials, energy, and transportation. In this severe situation, waiting and observing will only delay progress. The way out is to strengthen internal management of enterprises, to seek increased production through savings, to pursue efficiency through scientific management, and to strive for the goal of double increases and double savings.

The following are excerpts from the views expressed by some factory directors (managers) at a symposium:

Optimizing Enterprise Internal Management Methods: An Opportunity in Rectification and Reform

FU Qingfu, Director of Shandong Boshan Cement Factory: When enterprises encounter difficulties, they must study countermeasures, as has always been the case. Therefore, difficulties are also opportunities. In the current environment of rectification and reform, enterprises indeed face many external challenges such as unchanged contract targets and fierce competition in the cement market. Whether an enterprise can complete its contract targets and win in market competition ultimately depends on the overall quality and management level of the enterprise. For example, our factory used to address the issue of lax labor discipline by having leaders go on-site to inspect and supervise, supplemented by necessary penalties, which could only address the symptoms and be effective for a short time. However, implementing our own created "standardized work method" for scientific management has truly addressed the root cause.

GUO Lin, Director of Beijing Railway Bureau: The bureau handles one-third of the national coal transportation, "delivering good coal means no trouble, delivering bad coal means trouble"; passenger volume remains high, directly involving the safety of people's lives and property. If management is poor, problems will arise. A single mistake by a switchman can result in the dismissal of a minister or bureau director. The previous phase of decentralization and economic responsibility system, along with strengthened item management, was still superficial. Now, with the severe situation of rectification and reform, it is also an opportunity for enterprises to require breakthroughs in internal reforms. As an enterprise, one cannot just wait for the improvement of the overall environment but must first work on improving one's own quality. The chronic diseases in enterprise internal management must be treated, and new mechanisms for self-development and self-restraint must be established. How to do this? In one word, it all depends on self-creation and innovation. Grasping the optimization of enterprise internal management methods is the key to factory management and efficiency improvement.

Human-Centered: The Key to Optimizing Enterprise Internal Management Methods

YUAN Dongsu, Chief Economist of Anshan Iron and Steel Company: The gap in enterprise management mainly lies in the gap in human resources. In the past, management was often focused on managing money and materials, and this mindset needs to change. Anshan Steel's traditional management emphasizes managing people, focusing on ideological and political work, which is correct and should be continued. However, the issue of how people work according to scientific procedures in specific labor processes has not been solved. In other words, the past only solved the problem of mobilizing people's enthusiasm, but how to work, to what extent, and according to what standards has not been truly resolved. To address this issue, Anshan Steel, based on absorbing effective traditional experiences, further developed and created the new "three standards and three efficiencies management method" to make up for past shortcomings.

WANG Zengsheng, Party Secretary of Qingdao Ninth Rubber Factory: Our factory is a labor-intensive enterprise mainly relying on manual operations. For such a low-profit enterprise, it is impossible to offer high bonuses to stimulate workers' enthusiasm. This makes us realize that in a commodity economy, enterprise internal management can no longer be "seeing things but not people," but must manage people from multiple angles. Many management methods created by enterprises nowadays are almost all human-centered, which is not coincidental. Because improving people's quality is fundamental. Only by focusing on the full play of people's role can these management methods be said to be comprehensive, systematic, and scientifically sound.

Labor Productivity: The Goal of Optimizing Enterprise Internal Management Methods

MA Hongye, Director of Shaanxi Internal Combustion Engine Parts Factory No. 1: Improving enterprise efficiency always involves the issue of means. One means is to rely on product price increases. Price increases are a "shortcut" to obtaining economic benefits and the easiest method. However, this path is not viable. If everyone relies on product price increases, how can the country, the people, and the enterprises themselves bear it? The fundamental means is to work on optimizing enterprise internal management methods, reducing various consumptions, eliminating waste, and improving labor productivity. Our factory uses the "responsibility price control method" as a scientific management tool to control various consumptions, reduce costs, and achieve the goal of improving labor productivity.

ZHANG Xingran, Director of Shijiazhuang First Plastic Factory: Whether a management method is successful mainly depends on whether labor productivity can be improved, not just on production value or profit. Otherwise, every factory and every person will focus on product price increases.

LIU Jintang, Director of Dalian Cathode Ray Tube Factory: Optimizing enterprise internal management cannot focus only on partial issues; it is important to make the overall functions of the enterprise optimal, with all elements of productivity under effective control, creating an ideal labor productivity. Without this, the true meaning of our factory's created "full control management method" would be lost.

Diversity: The Trend in Optimizing Enterprise Internal Management Methods

GUO Lin: The situations of enterprises in China vary greatly, from ownership, production scale to technological characteristics. This determines the diversity of enterprise internal management methods. In the past, pursuing a single model has caused many problems. Uniformity is not as good as diversity. In recent years, various scientific management methods that have emerged in some enterprises across the country are all based on the actual situation of their own enterprises, serving the overall optimization of the enterprises, and have strong practicality and a certain vitality.

ZHANG Xingran: Factory directors and entrepreneurs are all practical people. If your management method is good and useful to me, I will learn it; if it is not suitable for me, even if you force me to learn it, I will not, or I will just go through the motions. Of course, a certain management method can be promoted in a certain industry or within a certain range. If it can be learned, learn it; if it cannot be learned, let it die naturally. In the past, people were used to promoting a single method or model, and the actual effect was not good. Now it is not feasible. The new approach is to let various management methods be tested, verified, and continuously improved in practice. As long as we adhere to "one center and two basic points," there is no need to worry that adopting diverse enterprise internal management methods will deviate from the socialist direction.

    治厂增效之道
    ——部分厂长（经理）谈加强企业内部管理
    在治理整顿、深化改革中，企业面临着资金、原材料、能源、运输等紧缺的困难。在这种严峻形势下，等待观望只能贻误大业。出路是，加强企业内部管理，以节约求增产，向科学管理要效益，以期实现双增双节的目标。
    现将部分厂长（经理）在一个座谈会上发表的意见节录如下：
                                        ——编者
    治理整顿：优化企业内部管理方法的机遇
    山东博山水泥厂厂长傅庆馥：企业遇到困难就要研究对策，历来如此。因此说，困难也是一种机遇。在治理整顿大环境下，企业确实承受着诸如承包指标不变、水泥市场竞争激烈等等许多外部挑战。企业能否完成承包指标，能否在市场竞争中取胜，归根到底取决于企业整体素质和管理水平的高低。比如，我们厂过去解决劳动纪律松懈问题，采取领导干部上岗检查、督促，辅以必要的处罚，只能治“表”，奏效于一时，而实行了自己创造的“规范化工作法”科学化管理，这才治了“本”。
    北京铁路局局长国林：京局运煤量占全国1／3，“倒好煤就不倒霉，倒不好煤就倒霉”；客运量居高不下，更涉及人民生命财产安全，管理不好就会出乱子。一个扳道工出差错，就可以把一个部长、局长的职撤掉。前一段放权让利，实行经济责任制，加强单项管理，还是浅层次的。而今治理整顿形势严峻，对企业来说也是个机遇，要求企业非在内部改革上有所突破不可。作为一个企业，不能只期待大环境的改善，而不先在自身素质的改善上下功夫。企业内部管理上的痼疾要治疗，新的自我发展、自我约束的机制要建立，怎么办？一句话，都要靠自己创造、创新。抓好优化企业内部管理方法，是治厂增效之本。
    以人为中心：优化企业内部管理方法的关键
    鞍山钢铁公司总经济师元东洙：企业管理存在的差距，主要表现在人的差距上。过去讲管理总是着眼于管钱管物，这种思想观念要改变。鞍钢的传统管理体现了对人的管理，侧重的是做人的思想政治工作，这是对的，今后还要坚持。但对人在具体劳动中，如何按照科学程序去做的问题还没解决。也就是说，过去只解决了调动人的积极性的问题，而如何干、干到什么程度、按什么标准干却未得到真正解决。针对这个问题，鞍钢在吸收传统有效经验的基础上，进一步发展、创造出新的“三标三效管理法”，弥补了过去的不足。
    青岛第九橡胶厂党委书记王增胜：我们厂是以手工操作为主的劳动密集型企业。像我们这样的微利企业，不可能拿出诱人的高额奖金来刺激职工的积极性。这使我们意识到，在商品经济条件下，企业内部管理再不能“见物不见人”，而要多侧面地搞好人的管理。现在不少企业创造出来的多种管理方法，几乎都是以人为中心，这不是偶然的。因为提高人的素质是根本性的。也只有着眼于人的作用的充分发挥，这些管理方法才可说是综合性的、系统的、合乎科学化要求的。
    劳动生产率：优化企业内部管理方法的目的
    陕西内燃机配件一厂厂长马宏业：提高企业效益，总有个途径问题。途径之一是靠产品提价。提价是获取经济效益的“捷径”，也是最省力的办法。但是，此路不通。大家都靠产品涨价，国家、人民和企业自己怎能承受得了？根本途径是下功夫优化企业内部管理方法，减少各种消耗，杜绝浪费，提高劳动生产率。我厂运用“责任价格控制法”科学化管理手段，来控制各种消耗，降低成本，达到了提高劳动生产率的目的。
    石家庄第一塑料厂厂长张兴让：一种管理方法是否成功，主要看劳动生产率能否提高，而不能单纯以产值、利润额来衡量。不然，厂厂、人人都会在产品提价上去做文章。
    大连显象管厂厂长刘金堂：优化企业内部管理，不能只重局部问题，重要的是要使企业整体功能处于优化状态，生产力的各个要素都在有效控制之下，创造理想的劳动生产率。如果没有这一点，那就失去了本厂创造的“全控管理法”的真正意义。
    多样化：优化企业内部管理方法的趋势
    国林：我国企业情况各异，从所有制、生产规模到工艺技术特点都有所不同。这就决定了企业内部管理方法的多样性。过去，追求一个模式吃尽了苦头。千厂一面不如千姿百态。近年来，在各地一些企业出现的多种科学化管理方法，都是从本企业实际出发，为企业整体优化服务的，具有很强的实用性和一定的生命力。
    张兴让：厂长、企业家都是讲实际的。你的管理方法好，对我有用，我才学；对我不适用，硬要我学，我也不学，要么就来个虚应付。当然，某种管理方法可以在某个行业、某些范围内推广。能学的就学，不能学的任其自生自灭。以往人们习惯于搞一种方法、一个模式，实际效果并不好。现在可行不通了。新的办法就是要让各种管理方法在实践中，经受检验、论证，并加以不断完善。只要坚持“一个中心两个基本点”，不用担心采取多样化的企业内部管理方法会偏离社会主义方向。
