	Today, the fourth page of this newspaper published an article titled "One Country, Two Systems" Must Not Be Sabotaged. The article cites numerous facts to expose that since the turmoil in Beijing, there have been a few individuals in Hong Kong who, fearing that the world is not chaotic enough, have been in collusion with some of the ringleaders of the counter-revolutionary riots in mainland China. They are attempting to stir up a wave of anti-communist and anti-Chinese sentiment in Hong Kong.
