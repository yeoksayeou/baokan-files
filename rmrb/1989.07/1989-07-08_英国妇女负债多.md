Title: British Women Have More Debt

A recent statistic from Britain shows that British women have more debt than women in other Western European countries. In the country's total consumer debt of 41.5 billion pounds, women account for more than half, excluding the ever-increasing mortgage loans. More notably, "shopping on credit" has become a fashionable consumption method for British women, while the traditional "save first, then shop" method is increasingly being scoffed at by more and more British women.

The reasons for this dramatic change in consumption patterns are complex. Firstly, as more and more women enter the workforce, they become more economically independent, and their wallets are filled with more money, naturally leading to a higher consumption mentality. Secondly, the widespread use of credit cards makes borrowing money as easy as flipping a hand, and women often cannot resist the strong temptation to buy items they like. Additionally, women's product stores, catering to the high-consumption mentality of female customers, have issued a large number of customer credit cards with annual interest rates as high as 19-40%.

According to reports, British women borrow money to buy high-end fashion, cars, jewelry, and some women borrow money to cope with family financial difficulties caused by their husband's unemployment, the birth of a new baby, or children going to college. The chairwoman of the British Women's National Committee, Joey Allen, pointed out that this consumption method, if not handled properly, can easily lead to family discord, even marital breakdown, and may burden the indebted women with a heavy mental load, affecting their health. Additionally, if the creditor is a loan shark, the debtor often cannot repay the ever-increasing debt, falling into a sea of troubles.

    英国妇女负债多
    唐若水
    英国最近一项统计显示：英国妇女负债比其他西欧国家的妇女都要多——在全国总共415亿英镑的消费债务中，妇女负债占了一半以上，其中还不包括与年俱增的房屋贷款。更引人注意的是，“欠债购物”似乎已成了英国妇女一种时髦的消费方式，相反，那种传统的“先攒钱后购物”的消费方式却被越来越多的英国妇女嗤之以鼻。
    引起消费方式戏剧性变化的原因是复杂的。首先，随着越来越多妇女去社会上谋职，她们经济上更趋独立，钱包里的金钱也更多了，高消费的心理因此自然抬头。其次，信用卡的普及使借债易如反掌，妇女们见到中意的商品时往往便经不住强烈的诱惑力。此外，妇女用品商店迎合广大女顾客的高消费心理，发行了大量的顾客信用卡，年利率高达19—40％。
    据报道，英国妇女借债购买的商品有高级时装、汽车、首饰等，也有部分妇女借债却是为了应付丈夫失业、新生儿诞生或孩子上大学等引起家庭经济拮据的“困境”的。英国妇女全国委员会主席乔依·艾伦指出，这种消费方式弄得不好极易导致家庭不和，甚至婚姻破裂，还可能让负债的妇女背上沉重的精神包袱而影响健康，此外如果债主是高利贷者，欠债人往往因还不起越滚越高的债务而陷入苦海之中。
