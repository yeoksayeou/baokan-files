	China's Science and Technology Exhibition Closes in the Soviet Union
	Over Ten Million Visitors  Several Intentional Agreements Signed

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 23 (Reporter Sheng Shiliang) Over ten million Soviet viewers have gained a deeper understanding of China's reform and opening-up achievements through the exhibits. The Chinese and Soviet sides signed dozens of trade, cooperative production, and joint venture intent agreements. These are some of the achievements of the China Science and Technology Exhibition, which closed today here.

	This exhibition opened on July 14 at the Soviet National Economic Achievements Exhibition Hall. Soviet Deputy Prime Minister and State Science and Technology Commission Chairman Lavrov and dozens of other Soviet officials at the level of deputy minister and above have visited the exhibition. This morning, despite the heavy rain, more than 300 visitors queued up with umbrellas waiting to enter. Before the exhibition hall closed, many visitors gathered around the exhibition stands, holding money, and requested to purchase daily necessities and food items with cash. Since this was not a trade fair, Chinese comrades could only politely decline.

	Liu Dongsheng, the head of the Chinese exhibition delegation and the first deputy director of the China Science and Technology Exchange Center, told this reporter that the exhibition has promoted mutual understanding between the Chinese and Soviet peoples. The older generation of Soviet friends has seen China's tremendous progress over the past few decades, while the younger generation of Soviet people has developed a keen interest in New China through their visit. Chinese science and technology and economic and trade personnel, through the exhibition, have introduced their achievements and products, learned about the Soviet market, and made cooperation partners.

    中国科技展览会在苏联闭幕
    十多万人参观  签署一批意向协定
    新华社莫斯科七月二十三日电　（记者盛世良）十多万苏联观众通过展品进一步了解中国改革开放的成果，中苏双方签署了几十项贸易、合作生产和合资企业的意向协定，这是今天在这里闭幕的中国科技展览会的部分成果。
    这次展览会是七月十四日在莫斯科国民经济成就展览馆开幕的。苏联部长会议副主席兼国家科委主席拉维奥罗夫等几十位苏联副部长以上的官员先后参观了展览。今天上午下着大雨，仍有三百多位观众打着伞排队等候参观。闭馆前，许多观众围着展台，举着钞票，请求用现金购买展览的日用品和食品。由于这不是展销会，中国同志只好婉言相拒。
    中国展览团团长、中国科技交流中心第一副主任刘东升对本社记者说，展览增进了中苏人民的相互了解，老一辈的苏联朋友看到了中国这几十年的巨大进步，年轻一代的苏联人通过参观激起了对新中国的浓厚兴趣。中国科技和经贸界人士通过参展，介绍了自己的成果和产品，了解了苏联市场，结交了合作伙伴。
