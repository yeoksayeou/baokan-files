Lanzhou Railway Bureau has achieved 300 consecutive days of safe operation, completing half of the year's tasks ahead of schedule. This outstanding performance has significantly contributed to stabilizing the national situation and promoting the economic development of the northwest region.

During the May and June disturbances this year, the Lanzhou Railway Bureau was one of the hardest-hit areas in Lanzhou, experiencing the earliest and longest duration of impact, with severe losses.

The bureau's employees demonstrated high political awareness and organizational discipline. Transportation department staff actively organized detours and reroutes, doing everything possible to increase speed and efficiency. Workers in the engineering and electrical departments repaired and maintained equipment, ensuring timely resumption of operations. Staff in the living and logistics departments provided water and meals to stranded crew members along the route. Public security officers worked tirelessly day and night to protect the safety of railway operations and key facilities.

    兰铁安全行车300天
    本报兰州7月16日电　记者张述圣报道：兰州铁路局以全面实现“时间过半，任务过半”和连续300天无行车重大事故的优异成绩，为稳定全国局势和发展西北经济作出突出贡献。
    今年5、6月动乱期间，兰州铁路局是兰州地区受冲击最早、时间最长、损失严重的“重灾户”。
    这个局广大职工表现了高度的政治觉悟和组织纪律性，运输部门的职工积极组织迂回折返，千方百计多拉快跑；工务、电务部门的职工整修维修设备，保证及时开通；生活、后勤部门的职工给困在沿途的乘务员送水送饭，公安干警日夜奋战，保卫行车单位和要害部门的安全。
