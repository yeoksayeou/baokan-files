From mid-April to mid-June, over a period of nearly two months, the situation in the capital developed continuously, evolving from student protests to turmoil, and then from turmoil to counter-revolutionary rebellion. This situation spread across the entire country. Correspondingly, the Party and the government took various measures: from repeated dialogue and persuasion, to martial law, and finally to suppressing the rebellion.

What a heart-pounding lesson! In such a complex struggle, it is not surprising that people have many questions they cannot immediately understand. Time will settle everything. What is most confusing now is: how did the situation develop from unarmed students protesting to the point of needing martial law and suppression? What are the things worth considering in this process?

	An Old Story: The Bear's Service. A bear wanted to help its master by killing a fly on the master's face, but in doing so, it smashed the master's head. Can we doubt the bear's good intentions and original motives? No. But can we forgive or even praise the bear's "service" that, in the name of helping the master, ended up killing the master? No.

	For the vast majority of students, their initial motives were to benefit our government, the country, and the reforms. However, when students took inappropriate actions and ignored the Party and government's repeated warnings, insisting on their own way, their good intentions were exploited by a few enemies, leading the situation to the opposite direction. Thus, the student protests turned into a complete "bear's service."

	A Principle of Judgment. When part of a person's body becomes diseased, how do we judge this person? How do we take appropriate measures? Two doctors come forward. Doctor A judges: this person is basically healthy, and the disease needs to be treated (through surgery or medication, etc.). Doctor B judges: this person is doomed, with no hope, so it's better to let him die. I think any sensible person would not agree with Doctor B's judgment and approach.

	Our Party and government have, long before the student protests, openly and proactively proposed to eliminate corruption and have already taken and are taking various measures. In this context, to judge the government as a "corrupt government" that must be "overthrown" and "destroyed" is like Doctor B.

	From another angle, towards a government of the people with its flaws, as towards a person, "those who love want it to live, those who hate want it to die." This is a matter of sentiment and stance, from which different judgments and attitudes are made.

	Everyone has the freedom to make judgments, but right or wrong has a clear principle, and cannot be ambiguous. On major issues of right and wrong, the stance must be firm, and the banner must be clear.

    学潮反思录
    从四月中旬到六月中旬，近两个月时间，首都事态不断发展，由学潮发展到动乱，又由动乱发展到反革命暴乱。这个事态波及了全国。与之相应，党和政府采取了种种办法：由反复对话、做工作，到戒严，最后到平息暴乱。
    真是惊心动魄的一课！在这种复杂的斗争中，人们有许多问题一时想不通，不足为怪。时间将沉淀一切。现在最容易使人迷惑的是：手无寸铁的学生闹学潮，最后到了要出兵戒严和平息的田地，事情到底是怎么发展变化的？其间有些什么东西值得人们思考？
    〔一则古老的故事〕《熊的服务》。熊原本是想帮助主人打死那脸上的一只苍蝇，结果一掌下去，把主人的脑袋打烂了。我们能怀疑熊的“为主人好”的动机和初衷吗？不能。可是，我们难道能原谅甚至赞美熊的这种为了主人好却把主人打死了的“服务”吗？也不能。
    就绝大部分学生来说，起初的动机都是为了我们的政府好，国家好，改革好。然而，当学生们采取不适当行动，又对党和政府的反复忠告置若罔闻，一意孤行，他们的良好的动机被极少数敌人阴谋利用了，就使事情走向了反面，就使学潮这件事变成了十足的“熊的服务”。
    〔一项原则的判断〕一个人，部分肌体发生了病变，如何来判断这个人？如何采取相应的办法？出来两位医师，甲医师判断说：这个人基本上是健康的，病变要治（通过手术或服药等）。乙医师则判断说：这个人已经完蛋，毫无希望，干脆让他死掉算了。我想，任何清醒的人都不会同意乙医师的判断和做法。
    我们的党和政府，早在学潮之前好久，就毫不讳言，而且主动提出了要清除腐败现象，而且已经和正在采取各种措施。在这种情况下，把政府判断为“腐败政府”，非“打倒”、“推翻”不可，那就像那位乙医师。
    从另一个角度看问题，对一个有缺点的人民自己的政府，如同对一个人一样，“爱者欲其生，恨者欲其死”。这是感情问题、立场问题，由此作出不同判断，采取不同态度。
    每个人都有作出判断的自由，但或是或非则有十分的原则性，不可模棱两可。对于大是大非问题，立场必须坚定，旗帜必须鲜明。
