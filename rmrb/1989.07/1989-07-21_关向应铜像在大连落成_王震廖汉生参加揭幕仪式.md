Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, July 21st.

The bronze statue of Guan Xiangying was unveiled in Dalian. Vice President Wang Zhen and Vice Chairman of the National People's Congress Standing Committee Liao Hansheng traveled from Beijing to attend the unveiling ceremony held today.

The bronze statue of Guan Xiangying, standing 4 meters tall, is located in Xiangying Square, Jinzhou District, Dalian City. Guan Xiangying is depicted in military uniform, riding a tall horse, symbolizing his life of military campaigns. The 4-meter-high black granite pedestal in front of the statue is inscribed with Mao Zedong's eulogy: "Loyal and steadfast, for the Party and the country, Comrade Xiangying will never die."

It is reported that Guan Xiangying was born in 1902 and was a printer by trade. He joined the Communist Youth League of China in 1924 and the Communist Party of China in 1925. Together with comrades such as He Long, he consolidated and developed the Xiang-E-West Soviet area, established the Qian-Dong revolutionary base, and expanded the Red Army. In 1934, Guan Xiangying served as the Deputy Political Commissar of the Red Second Army. During the Long March, he served as the Deputy Political Commissar of the Second Front Army. He, along with He Long, Ren Bishi, and others, firmly opposed Zhang Guotao's plot to split the Party and actively maintained the unity of the Party and the Red Army. By the end of 1936, he served as the Political Commissar of the Second Front Army. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he served as the Political Commissar of the 120th Division of the Eighth Route Army. He, along with He Long and others, led the 120th Division in the vast areas of Jinxi, Jinzhong, and Jinsui, annihilating a large number of Japanese and puppet troops, and strengthening the anti-Japanese armed forces. In 1945, he was re-elected as a Central Committee member at the Party's Seventh Congress. Comrade Guan Xiangying, overworked and sick, passed away in Yan'an on July 21, 1946.

Vice President Wang Zhen spoke at the unveiling ceremony, pointing out that Comrade Guan Xiangying had a deep foundation in Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and an unshakable communist faith. He was upright and considerate of the bigger picture, democratic in his style, and united with his comrades. He was always diligent and frugal, sharing weal and woe with the people. Wang Zhen hoped that everyone would take Comrade Guan Xiangying as an example, unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, earnestly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles that are the foundation of the state, and continue to implement the reform and opening-up policy that is the path to national strength. He hoped that everyone would inherit and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, work together in unity and confidence, and continue to push forward the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening-up in our country.
