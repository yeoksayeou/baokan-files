The counter-revolutionary riot that shook the nation and occurred in the capital Beijing has now largely subsided. In the process of its evolution from a student movement to turmoil to a riot, many well-meaning people had advised the young people involved to stop, and the Party and government had consistently adopted a restrained attitude. However, a small number of people with ulterior motives did not give an inch, gradually escalating the situation, ultimately leading to this serious counter-revolutionary incident. Reflecting on the events before and after, people deeply feel that the occurrence of this counter-revolutionary riot was not accidental.

Over the past decade, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has repeatedly pointed out that if we pursue bourgeois liberalization and do not adhere to the four fundamental principles, we will "have another round of turmoil," and "there may be some big and small troubles that could have been avoided." After this counter-revolutionary riot was initially suppressed, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out even more profoundly: "This turmoil was bound to come. It is determined by both the international climate and China's own small climate, and it is inevitable, not subject to human will, only a matter of time and scale." Deeply studying these important thoughts of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, understanding the root causes and essence of this counter-revolutionary riot, is of great significance for unifying thoughts, summarizing experiences and lessons, and creating a future for our Party and country.

This counter-revolutionary riot occurred under certain international conditions. In fact, since the emergence of socialism in the world, there has been a struggle between socialism and capitalism. In recent years, some comrades have not emphasized this point. However, the reactionary forces in the international community that oppose socialism have never forgotten to infiltrate the politics and ideology of socialist countries. In 1988, some countries openly declared that they could not "hide the fundamental differences between totalitarian politics and democratic politics," and they would encourage the "liberalization trend" within socialist countries, "seizing every opportunity to support liberalization."

In their pursuit of the so-called "victory without war" and "peaceful transformation" of socialism, they fully utilized the tortuous development process of the contemporary international communist movement and the reforms of socialist countries. It is undeniable that the international communist movement has encountered new situations, experienced turbulence, and setbacks in its development. In connection with this, many socialist countries have embarked on the path of reform. The reform of socialist countries is the self-improvement of socialism, aimed at fully exploiting the advantages of socialism, consolidating and developing the socialist system. However, some people who hate socialism in the international community regard the twists and turns in the development of communism and the reforms of socialist countries as "obvious failures of communism." They gleefully exaggerate the so-called "crisis" of communism, denigrate Marxism as "outdated," and even predict that communism will "die" in the early 21st century. These international reactionary incitements, combined with certain internal factors, have led to varying degrees of turmoil in some socialist countries. The counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing is also a product induced by this international background. For example, _Voice of America_ extended its broadcasting time and increased its frequency, spreading rumors and stirring up trouble, and in a sense, became the vanguard of the riot. Fang Lizhi and his wife, who have always been anti-Party and anti-socialism, were able to flee to the U.S. Embassy after the riot was suppressed, which also exposed the international background behind the riot. Without the incitement and support of international reactionary forces, the riot would not have developed to such a serious extent.

The inevitability of this counter-revolutionary riot is also determined by the domestic "small climate." Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, in the course of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, we have repeatedly encountered the onslaught of bourgeois liberalization: the "Democracy Wall" incident in Xidan in 1978; the "spiritual pollution" around 1981; and some student disturbances in 1986. The counter-revolutionary riot in the capital is the inevitable result of the long-term spread and malignant development of bourgeois liberalization over the past decade.

On the issue of how to modernize and what kind of modernization to pursue, we have sharp contradictions with the advocates of bourgeois liberalization. The four fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution are the foundation of our country and the fundamental guarantee for the modernization drive. Our modernization is socialist modernization under the leadership of the Party. The advocates of bourgeois liberalization are completely different. Although some people frequently change their slogans and strategies at different times, and sometimes even verbally support the Communist Party and socialism, they are essentially opposed to the Communist Party and socialism, advocating a capitalist path and turning our country into a fully Westernized bourgeois republic. Those who know a little about modern Chinese history know that their advocacy is just a pipe dream, the result of which can only lead China to the path of a colony, semi-colony, and a vassal state dependent on imperialism and capitalist countries. For a long time, Comrade Deng Xiaoping has been unwavering in his struggle against bourgeois liberalization. He said: "I have talked the most about opposing bourgeois liberalization and I am the most insistent." He also repeatedly reminded the whole Party that opposing bourgeois liberalization is a long-term task that must be carried through the entire process of the four modernizations. However, because some people within the Party have not seriously implemented these principles, adopting an attitude of indulgence, encouragement, and even support towards bourgeois liberalization, this eventually led to this serious counter-revolutionary riot.

This counter-revolutionary riot also has a certain social basis. In our country, the exploiting class as a class has been eliminated, but due to domestic factors and international influences, class struggle will still exist to a certain extent for a long time, and under certain conditions, it may even intensify. Numerous facts, especially the blood and fire of this counter-revolutionary riot, prove that in today's society, there are not only those who have long stubbornly adhered to the stance of bourgeois liberalization, engaged in political conspiracies, colluded with overseas and foreign reactionary forces, and remnants of the "Gang of Four," but also some released criminals and other social dregs who have not been reformed. Although these people have different characteristics, under certain conditions, they will come together to form a reactionary force, opposing the Party's leadership and the socialist system. The situation over the past decade shows that whenever the bourgeois liberalization trend spreads to a certain extent, these people will always come together, stirring up trouble, which is also not subject to human will.

Over the past decade of reform and opening up, we have achieved great successes, but there have also been some mistakes, thus providing opportunities for various "troubles." Our biggest mistake is in education, where we have not made great efforts to educate the people, cadres, Party members, and especially the youth with the four fundamental principles, the Party's fine traditions, and the spirit of hard work. As a result, many people have lost their spiritual pillar. They have forgotten or do not know the history of the Party, forgotten or do not know the tragic lessons of the "Cultural Revolution," forgotten or do not know what kind of country China is today, forgotten or do not know the direction in which China is developing, and thus, when turmoil or even riot comes, some people are confused and even used by others to fan the flames of turmoil and riot. We must also be soberly aware that in recent years, some cadres and Party members have not stood the test of being in power and reform and opening up; some lack the spirit of hard work and have seriously alienated themselves from the masses; some have even degenerated and become enemies of the people. This situation has not only seriously weakened the Party's prestige among the people but also provided excuses for a few people to create turmoil and plot riots. The reason why this turmoil and riot were able to draw in so many people for a time is not unrelated to the fact that the Party's body is not so healthy.

From the analysis of the domestic and international environment, this riot was indeed bound to come, and now it has come at a relatively advantageous time for us. Because the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries, represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, is still alive, making it easier for us to handle the riot. In this riot, a small group of bad elements mixed in with so many young students and onlookers, intertwining enemy contradictions with people's internal contradictions, which is something that has never happened in the history of the Republic. Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the old generation of revolutionaries have rich experience in struggle, keen insight, and the ability to see the big picture from small details. When the turmoil first broke out, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly pointed out that it was a turmoil, and when the turmoil developed into a counter-revolutionary riot, the Party Central Committee immediately took decisive measures to quickly suppress it, preventing it from becoming a national disaster, saving the Party, and saving the Republic. Through this riot and the struggle against it, people have also opened their eyes and received a profound education. Class struggle will exist to a certain extent for a long time, and people will remember this well. This riot coming now also makes our Party and government think more timely and calmly about the past, present, and future. China's decade of change fully proves that the line since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee is completely correct. The occurrence of this riot is precisely the result of our not fully adhering to this line, producing evil consequences. The two basic points of the Party's basic line—the four upholds and reform and opening up—are like the two wheels of a cart, neither of which can be neglected, otherwise, the cart will overturn. While accelerating reform and opening up, we have not consistently and seriously adhered to the four fundamental principles, allowing the bourgeois liberalization trend to spread unchecked, which is an important reason for the occurrence of this riot. Seriously learning from this lesson, carrying forward our strengths, correcting our mistakes, and making up for our shortcomings, fully implementing the Party's basic line, our socialist cause will definitely advance more steadily, better, and faster. In this way, the counter-revolutionary riot, this bad thing, can also be turned into a good thing.

    反革命暴乱的发生不是偶然的
    何沙
    发生在首都北京的这场震惊全国的反革命暴乱，已经基本平息了。在由学潮到动乱到暴乱的演变过程中，不少善良的人们曾经劝告卷入其中的年轻人适可而止，党和政府也一直采取克制的态度，但是，极少数别有用心的人，却寸步不让，逐步升级，最后形成了这场严重的反革命事件。回顾事件的前前后后，人们深深感到这场反革命暴乱的发生不是偶然的。
    近十年来，邓小平同志曾多次指出，如果搞资产阶级自由化，不坚持四项基本原则，就会“再来一次折腾”，就“可能出现一些本来可以避免的大大小小的乱子”。这场反革命暴乱初步平息后，邓小平同志更加深刻地指出：“这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的，只不过是迟早的问题，大小的问题。”深入学习邓小平同志的这些重要思想，认清这场反革命暴乱的根源和实质，对于统一思想，总结经验教训，开创我们党和国家的未来，具有重要意义。
    这场反革命暴乱是在一定的国际气候条件下发生的。事实上，在世界上有了社会主义以后，就存在着社会主义和资本主义的斗争。对于这一点，最近一些年来我们有些同志不大讲了。但是，国际上那些敌视社会主义的反动势力，却始终没有忘记对社会主义国家政治上思想上的渗透。1988年有的国家公开宣称，“不能把极权政治与民主政治的根本分歧掩饰起来”，要鼓励社会主义国家“国内的自由化趋势”，“一有机会就要努力支持自由化”。
    他们在推行所谓对社会主义“不战而胜”、“和平变革”的策略中，还充分利用了当代国际共产主义运动曲折发展的进程和社会主义国家的改革。无庸讳言，世界共产主义运动在其发展过程中，遇到了新的情况，经历了动荡和挫折。与此相联系，不少社会主义国家走上了改革的道路。社会主义国家的改革是社会主义的自我完善，目的是为了充分发挥社会主义的优越性，巩固和发展社会主义制度。但是国际上有些仇视社会主义的人，却把共产主义这种发展中的曲折和社会主义国家的改革看成是“共产主义的明显失败”。他们幸灾乐祸地渲染共产主义的所谓“危机”，诋毁马克思主义已经“过时”，甚至预言共产主义将在下个世纪前期“死亡”。国际上的这些反动煽动，加上某些内部因素，使一些社会主义国家相继出现了不同程度的动乱。发生在北京的这场反革命暴乱，也是这种国际背景诱发的产物。请看，《美国之音》又是延长播音时间，又是增加播放频率，大肆造谣惑众，煽风点火，从某种意义上讲，成了这场暴乱的急先锋。一向反党反社会主义的方励之夫妇，在暴乱平息后居然能跑进美国大使馆躲起来，这也暴露了这场暴乱后面的国际背景。没有国际反动势力的鼓噪和支持，这场暴乱决不致发展到如此严重的程度。
    这场反革命暴乱之所以不可避免，也是由国内的小气候决定的。十一届三中全会以来，在我国四化建设的征途上不断遇到资产阶级自由化思潮的袭扰：1978年出现过西单“民主墙”事件；1981年前后，出现过精神污染；1986年出现过有些学生闹事的问题。首都这场反革命暴乱，正是十年来资产阶级自由化思潮长期泛滥和恶性发展的必然结果。
    在怎样搞现代化和搞什么样的现代化问题上，我们同资产阶级自由化的主张存在着尖锐的对立。载入宪法的四项基本原则，是我国的立国之本，也是现代化建设事业的根本保证。我们的现代化，是在党的领导下的社会主义现代化。资产阶级自由化的主张则完全不同。有些人尽管在不同时期经常变换口号和策略，有时甚至口头上也拥护共产党、拥护社会主义，但他们实质上始终是反对共产党、反对社会主义的，是主张走资本主义道路、把我国变为一个全盘西化的资产阶级共和国的。稍微懂得一点中国近代历史的人都知道，他们这种主张不过是一种梦呓，其结果只能把中国引向殖民地、半殖民地的道路，做一个依附帝国主义、资本主义国家的附庸国。长期以来，邓小平同志同资产阶级自由化进行了不懈的斗争。他说：“反对资产阶级自由化，我讲得最多，而且我最坚持。”他还谆谆告诫全党，反对资产阶级自由化是长期的任务，要贯穿到四化建设的全过程。但由于党内有的人没有认真贯彻这些精神，对资产阶级自由化采取纵容、鼓励、甚至支持的态度，结果终于导致了这场严重的反革命暴乱。
    这次反革命暴乱还有其一定的社会基础。在我国，剥削阶级作为阶级已经消灭了，但由于国内的因素和国际的影响，阶级斗争还将在一定范围内长期存在，在某种条件下还有可能激化。大量事实特别是这场反革命暴乱的血与火证明，在我们今天的社会里，不仅有那些长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人，与海外、国外反动势力相勾结的人，“四人帮”的残渣余孽，而且还有一些没有改造好的刑满释放分子和其他社会渣滓。尽管这些人的特点有所不同，但在一定条件下他们会纠合在一起，形成一股反动势力，反对党的领导，反对社会主义制度。十年来的情况表明，每当资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥到一定程度的时候，这些人总是紧紧纠合在一起而蠢蠢欲动，兴风作浪，这也是不以人的意志为转移的。
    改革开放十年来，我们取得了伟大成绩，但也有一些失误，从而为各种“乱子”提供了机会。我们最大的失误是在教育方面，没有下大力用四项基本原则、党的优良传统、艰苦奋斗的精神教育人民、教育干部、教育党员，特别是教育青年。结果，不少人失去精神支柱。他们忘了或不了解党的历史，忘了或不了解“文化大革命”的悲惨教训，忘了或不了解中国今天是个什么样的国家，忘了或不了解中国要向什么方向发展，因而当动乱甚至暴乱来临的时候，有些人便是非不清，甚至被人利用，为动乱、暴乱推波助澜。我们还要清醒地看到，近几年来有些干部和党员经不起执政和改革开放的考验，有的缺乏艰苦奋斗的精神，严重地脱离了人民群众；有的甚至蜕化变质，成了人民的罪人。这种情况，不仅严重削弱了党在人民群众中的威望，也为极少数人制造动乱、策划暴乱提供了借口。这场动乱和暴乱之所以一度能把那么多群众卷进去，同党的肌体不那么健康不能说没有关系。
    从国内外环境的分析看，这场暴乱确实是迟早要来的，而现在来对我们比较有利。因为现在以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家还健在，使我们处理暴乱比较容易。在这场暴乱中，一小撮坏人混杂在那么多青年学生和围观群众中间，敌我矛盾与人民内部矛盾交织在一起，这在共和国的历史上是从来没有遇到过的。邓小平同志等老一辈革命家，具有丰富的斗争经验，明察秋毫，见微知著。在风波乍起的时候，邓小平同志就明确指出这是一次动乱，当动乱一经发展为反革命暴乱，党中央便立即采取果断措施，迅速予以平息，没有演变为全国性的灾难，挽救了党，挽救了共和国。经过这场暴乱和反暴乱的洗礼，人们也擦亮了眼睛，受到了深刻的教育。阶级斗争在一定范围内将长期存在，人们将会很好地记住这一点。这场暴乱现在到来，也使我们的党和政府更及时、更冷静地思考过去、现在和未来。我国的十年巨变，充分证明党的十一届三中全会以来的路线是完全正确的。这场暴乱的发生，恰恰是我们没有能够全面坚持这条路线而产生的恶果。党的基本路线中的四个坚持和改革开放这两个基本点，犹如一架车子的两个轮子，不能稍有偏废，否则就要翻车。我们在加速改革开放的同时，没有始终一贯地认真坚持四项基本原则，听任资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥，这正是这场暴乱发生的一个重要根源。认真记取这个教训，发扬长处，纠正失误，弥补不足，全面贯彻党的基本路线，我们的社会主义事业就一定会前进得更稳、更好、更快。这样，反革命暴乱这件坏事，也就可以变成为一件好事。
