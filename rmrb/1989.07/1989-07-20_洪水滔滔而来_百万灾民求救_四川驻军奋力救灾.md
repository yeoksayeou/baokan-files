From July 7th to 11th, the first major rainstorm since the rainy season hit more than 80 counties and cities in eastern Sichuan. The sudden surge of mountain floods caused rivers to rise rapidly, resulting in the collapse of tens of thousands of houses and the submersion of nearly a million acres of farmland. Nearly a hundred towns and villages were surrounded by floodwaters.

After the disaster, the Sichuan-based troops of the Chengdu Military Region bravely rushed to the rescue. On the 8th, the Chengdu Military Region Party Committee issued an order to all troops stationed in the disaster-stricken areas: to spare no effort in supporting local rescue and relief efforts. The Chengdu Military Region Air Force overcame numerous difficulties and dispatched three helicopters to transport the provincial government inspection team to the disaster area, allowing the million affected people to receive the care of the Party and government the day after the disaster. By the 20th, the troops stationed in the disaster area and the military sub-districts, county (city, district) people's armed forces departments, with the mission of saving people from the floodwaters, had dispatched a total of 730,000 troops and militiamen. They fought against the floods for 13 days, rescuing more than 110,000 people trapped by the floods, and transporting nearly 30,000 tons of various materials.

On the 9th, Liangping County was surrounded by floodwaters, and the disaster-stricken people who had fled to the rooftops were waiting for their relatives to come to their rescue. A certain Red Army regiment, which had just returned from the Old Mountain Front, dispatched three batches of troops, totaling nearly 1,100 personnel, to Liangping County. The Third Company and Engineering Company of a certain unit in Chongqing received orders to rush to Jiangbei County's Tongjing District to rescue people trapped by the floods. They brought assault boats and folding boats to the scene to rescue the disaster-stricken people. After fighting for more than 10 hours, they safely rescued the people who had been surrounded by water for more than 40 hours and rescued materials worth more than 8 million yuan.
