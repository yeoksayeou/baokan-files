Romanian agricultural scientists have transformed 190,000 hectares of sandy land into arable land capable of growing 21 different crops over a span of 20 years.

This area, located between Craiova City and the Danube River in southern Romania, is the result of the hard work of numerous researchers at the Tebreni Sandland Agricultural Research Station established here. According to statistics, Romania once had 460,000 hectares of sandy land, with nearly half of it located south of Craiova City. The director of the research station and professor at Craiova University, Banicea, told our reporter that this area has always had strong winds and a dry climate, making it difficult for crops to grow and leading to a miserable life for farmers. Starting in 1965, technical personnel began the arduous task of transforming the desert. Their first task was to organize manpower to use bulldozers and tractors to level the sand dunes, then they built 450 kilometers of irrigation canals and 1,600 hectares of windbreaks. Between the windbreaks, they built farmland and planted wheat, corn, soybeans, vegetables, and fruit trees. Notably, there are many naked oats among the crops. Banicea told the reporter that naked oats can serve as a windbreak. After harvesting the naked oats, the stalks are left in the field and buried in the sand to fertilize the soil. Here, only the fruits of various crops are harvested, leaving the roots and stems in the ground, which are then plowed deep into the soil by tractors to increase soil fertility.

The research station has also conducted research and breeding of crop varieties suitable for sandy land. Over the past 20 years, more than 100 varieties of grains, feed, vegetables, and fruits suitable for sandy land have been successfully bred.

    罗马尼亚：沙地变农田
    罗马尼亚农业科学工作者在20年时间里，把19万公顷的沙地改造为可种植21种农作物的可耕地。
    这片位于罗马尼亚南部克拉约瓦市与多瑙河之间的沙地，是设在这里的特布雷尼沙地作物中心研究站的广大科研工作者艰辛劳动改造沙漠的成果。
    据统计，罗马尼亚全国曾有46万公顷沙地，克拉约瓦市以南的地区就占近一半。该研究站主任、克拉约瓦大学教授巴尼策对本社记者说，这里历来风沙大，气候干燥，农作物难以生长，农民生活十分困苦。从1965年起，科技人员来到这里，开始改造沙漠的艰苦工作。他们的首要任务是组织人力用推土机、拖拉机把沙丘推平，然后又修起了450公里长的水渠和1600公顷的防风林。在防风林带之间修起了农田，种植小麦、玉米、大豆、蔬菜和果树。引人注目的是，农作物之间有不少裸麦。巴尼策对记者说，裸麦能起到防风的作用。裸麦收割后，麦秆留在田里，埋进沙土里可以肥田。这里收割各种农作物只收果实，把根茎都留在地里，然后用拖拉机深翻在地下，以增加土壤的肥力。
    该研究站还对那些适于沙地种植的农作物品种进行研究和培育。20多年来成功地培育出100多种适于沙地生长的粮食、饲料，蔬菜和水果品种。
