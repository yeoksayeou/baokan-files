New China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 11th - Although there are approximately 110,000 to 140,000 dogs in the Hong Kong region, no cases of rabies have been reported among humans or animals in the past two years. Therefore, Hong Kong has announced itself as a "rabies-free region" starting from July 10th.

According to the relevant regulations of the World Health Organization, any region that has had no reported cases of rabies among humans or animals for two consecutive years is considered a "rabies-free region." The last reported case of rabies in Hong Kong was on July 10th, 1987.

    香港成为“非狂犬病地区”
    新华社香港7月11日电　尽管香港地区大约有11至14万只狗，但过去两年内未发现人或动物在本土染上狂犬病，所以香港从7月10日起宣布为“非狂犬病地区”。
    根据世界卫生组织的有关规定，任何一个在两年内未有人或动物在本土染上狂犬病的地区即为“非狂犬病地区”。香港发现的最后一起狂犬病是在1987年7月10日。
