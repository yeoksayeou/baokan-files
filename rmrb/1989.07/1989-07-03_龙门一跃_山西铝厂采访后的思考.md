The banks of the Yellow River in Huanghe County, Shanxi Province, are home to the legendary "Dragon Gate," where carp are said to leap to become dragons. Recently, the first phase of the Shanxi Aluminum Plant, a key project from the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," was completed here and passed national inspection, officially starting production. The plant is designed to produce 200,000 tons of alumina annually. For now, compared to China's other alumina producers in Zhengzhou, Shandong, and Guizhou, it is a "little brother." However, it has a bright future and is crucial, poised to become a major player in China's aluminum industry's leap over the "Dragon Gate."

Since its successful smelting in 1886 abroad, aluminum's excellent properties have been increasingly recognized. Currently, aluminum cookware accounts for over 70% of the cookware market in the United States. Replacing steel with aluminum in transportation reduces weight by 35%, increases capacity, and saves energy. High-rise buildings using aluminum window frames are aesthetically pleasing, corrosion-resistant, have good sound insulation, and are tightly sealed. Additionally, aluminum is widely used in aerospace, power, defense, and packaging sectors. Perhaps because of its many features and uses, aluminum has rapidly risen to become the "second" most important metal after steel.

However, in China, the "second" metal does not yet hold its rightful position. Based on the general production ratio of aluminum to steel of 1:20, China's aluminum production should reach 3 million tons to be reasonable, but the current actual production is only a quarter of that. Per capita aluminum consumption in China is currently only 0.7 kilograms, which is 1/6 of the world average. Seizing the opportunity in the aluminum market, speculators have made huge profits, causing aluminum prices to soar. From the complaints of housewives, one can see that the price of aluminum cookware has doubled in the past two years; even a small lunch box has increased from over 1 yuan to over 2 yuan, even over 3 yuan. From newspapers and radio broadcasts, one can learn that many aluminum processing enterprises are facing the embarrassing situation of halting production due to lack of materials, waiting for supplies. Is it that the state does not pay enough attention to the aluminum industry? As early as the beginning of the "Sixth Five-Year Plan," the central government had determined the policy of "prioritizing the development of aluminum" among non-ferrous metals, and investment has surged. Is it that aluminum ore resources are scarce? Over 30 years of geological exploration have shown that China is one of the few countries in the world with aluminum ore reserves exceeding 1 billion tons, with great potential. The appearance of this situation has multiple causes. China's aluminum industry started late, with limited scale, and production cannot meet the growing demand. Energy shortages also restrict the full utilization of existing production capacity. Ignoring national conditions and engaging in premature consumption has further exacerbated the supply-demand gap. Moreover, it should be noted that the original unreasonable structure of the aluminum industry has become even more unbalanced in recent years. Due to the rapid establishment of large and small aluminum processing enterprises, the country has formed an inverted pyramid structure where aluminum processing capacity far exceeds aluminum electrolysis capacity, and aluminum electrolysis capacity far exceeds alumina production capacity. Alumina production has become a major factor constraining the development of the aluminum industry, requiring the import of tens of millions of tons annually. Therefore, fully utilizing China's bauxite resources and accelerating the development of alumina production have become an urgent task for China's aluminum industry to quickly leap over the "Dragon Gate."

Shanxi has unique advantages in developing the aluminum industry, with bauxite reserves accounting for 40% of the national total, high grades, shallow burial, and easy exploitation. The Shanxi Aluminum Plant has the Yellow River to the west, inexhaustible coal and limestone to the north, and convenient transportation with the Houxi Railway and Jinyu Highway to the east and south. Experts believe that building a modern large-scale alumina production base here is advantageous.

The overall project of the Shanxi Aluminum Plant is divided into three phases. Upon completion, it will produce 2 million tons of alumina, 300,000 tons of electrolytic aluminum, 900,000 tons of cement, and 100,000 tons of aluminum processing annually, becoming China's largest aluminum integrated enterprise and alumina production base. Currently, the first phase, which has been in trial production for a year, has passed inspection and created a series of new records such as short construction period and high product quality; the second phase, designed to produce 1 million tons of alumina annually with an investment estimate of 1.85 billion yuan, is also in full swing and is scheduled to start production in 1993; the preparatory work for the third phase is also actively underway. The entire project is listed as a "top priority" and "best of the best" in the non-ferrous metal industry, receiving protection and support.

According to predictions from over 100 metallurgical experts, with the rise of this modern aluminum city in Shanxi, China's aluminum industry is eager to make that crucial "leap over the Dragon Gate."

    龙门一跃
    ——山西铝厂采访后的思考
    李德民　刘东华
    山西河津县黄河之滨的龙门山，是传说中“鲤鱼跳龙门”的地方。前不久，我国“六五”重点建设项目山西铝厂一期工程，就在这里通过国家验收，正式投产。该工程设计能力为年产氧化铝20万吨，从眼前看，同我国生产氧化铝的郑州铝厂、山东铝厂和贵州铝厂相比不过是位“小兄弟”，但是它前途无量，举足轻重，将成为我国铝工业发展“龙门一跃”中的一条“大鱼”。
    自1886年国外冶炼成功以来，铝的优良性能已越来越多地为人们所认识，目前美国铝制炊具已占到炊具业的70％以上；运输工具以铝代钢，铝制车船体可减轻自重35％，增加运量，节约能源；高层建筑采用铝制窗框，外观美，耐腐蚀，隔音效果好，封闭严密。另外，铝还广泛应用于航天、电力、军工、包装等部门。或许正因为具有诸多特点和用途，铝金属才得以迅速崛起，在金属圈内，钢铁是“老大”，铝是“老二”。
    然而在我国，“老二”还没有“老二”应有的地位。按铝与钢1∶20的一般产量比算，我国的铝产量也要达到300万吨才算合理，而现在的实际产量仅为其1／4；人均铝的消费，目前我国仅有0.7公斤，占世界平均水平的1／6。瞅准铝市场的巨大缺口，“倒爷”们乘虚而入，大发横财，致使铝价一涨再涨，扶摇直上。从家庭主妇的牢骚里，可以看出近两年铝制炊具成倍涨价的行情，一个小小的饭盒也从1元多到2元多甚至3元多了；从报纸上、广播中，又会了解到不少铝加工企业已处于停工待料、等米下锅的尴尬境地。是国家对铝工业重视不够吗？早在“六五”初期，中央就确定了有色金属“优先发展铝”的方针，投资量猛增；是铝土资源贫乏吗？30多年的地质勘探查明，我国是世界上少数几个铝矿资源超过10亿吨的国家之一，潜力巨大。出现这种情况，有多方面的原因。我国铝工业起步较晚，规模有限，生产满足不了日益增长的消费需求。能源的紧张，也限制了现有生产能力的充分发挥。忽视国情的超前消费，又加剧了供需之间的矛盾。同时，应该看到，原本就不够合理的铝工业内部结构，近年来更加向着不合理的方向倾斜。由于大大小小的铝加工企业一哄而起，全国已形成铝加工能力远远超出铝电解能力，铝电解能力又大大高于氧化铝生产能力的倒金字塔结构。氧化铝生产成了制约铝工业发展的突出因素之一，每年要进口几十万吨。因此，充分利用我国的铝土矿资源，加速发展氧化铝生产，已成为我国铝工业尽快跃过“龙门”的当务之急。
    山西发展铝工业具有资源、能源、市场等得天独厚的优势，铝土矿储量占全国总储量的40％，且品位高，埋藏浅，易于开发利用。山西铝厂西有取之不尽的黄河水，北有用之不竭的原煤和石灰石，东部、南部有侯西铁路、晋禹公路出晋连秦，交通便利。专家认为，在这里建设现代化的大型氧化铝生产基地，条件优越。
    山西铝厂的总体工程分三期进行，全部竣工后将形成年产200万吨氧化铝、30万吨电解铝、90万吨水泥并10万吨铝材加工的规模，成为我国最大的铝联合企业和氧化铝生产基地。眼下，经过一年试生产的一期工程已验收合格，创造出建设工期短、产品质量高等一系列新纪录；设计年产100万吨氧化铝、投资概算为18.5亿元的二期工程建设也已进入高潮，将于1993年投产；三期工程的前期准备工作也正在积极进行。整体工程被列为有色金属工业的“重中之重”、“优中之优”加以保护和支持。
    据100多位冶金专家预测，随着山西这座现代化铝城的崛起，我国铝工业跃跃欲试，正准备实现那关键性的“龙门一跃”。
