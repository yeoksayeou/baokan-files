	The Asian Games' Crucial Dress Rehearsal
	— Written on the Occasion of the Opening of the Asian Boxing Championships

	Although the level of boxing in Asia is not on par with Europe and America, the smaller weight classes often win the gold cups in major international tournaments. This time, although the number of countries and regions participating in the 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championships is not large, all the teams capable of winning medals are present. Undoubtedly, this dragon-tiger fight held in Beijing during the summer will be an important dress rehearsal before the Asian Games next year.

	The most eye-catching team is the re-emerging and ambitious Chinese team. Since 1986, when boxing was reintroduced in this populous country, the level of Chinese boxing has improved rapidly. Last year, with great courage, they stepped onto the Olympic stage and surprisingly entered the top 8, making quite a splash. More and more people believe that the names of Chinese boxers will appear on the gold medal list at the Beijing Asian Games. In fact, Chinese boxing officials are already aiming for the honor of being Asian champions. Coach Wang Guojun has stated that winning two or three gold medals is not impossible, and officials from the boxing association have even more clearly outlined four reasons for winning medals: first, since 1987, Chinese athletes have never returned empty-handed from international competitions, always bringing back medals of varying quality; second, striking power, endurance, and physical strength have shown significant improvements; third, the advocated style of "fierce, relentless, heavy, and fast" has begun to take shape; fourth, they have the advantages of time, place, and people. Clearly, the young Chinese boxers are eager to showcase their strength in front of their hometown audience.

	In terms of overall strength, the South Korean team is likely the strongest among all participating teams this time. They did not send the athletes who competed in the Olympics last year, but according to their coach, Wu Renshi, this team, with an average age of just over 20, is basically the lineup for the Asian Games next year. Among them, the athletes in the 48 kg, 51 kg, 54 kg, and 57 kg weight classes have all been gold medalists in regional international competitions, while the 63.5 kg athlete, Kim Ki-Jae, was a World Cup champion. It seems that the South Korean boxing scene is teeming with talent, and they will be the strongest rivals for the Chinese team.

	In addition, the Mongolian team, known for its European-style boxing, has won an Olympic bronze medal and multiple top-8 finishes in the world. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea's smaller weight class athletes have impressive records, and Thailand's boxing has a long history, all of which could potentially reach the finals.

	Perhaps we should pay special attention to the competition in the heavier weight classes. Heavyweight boxing is relatively less developed in Asia, and the Chinese team has identified it as a breakthrough for dominance in Asia. However, teams from Pakistan, India, and other countries also have heavyweight athletes this time.

	What attracts people to boxing is the direct qualities of strength, speed, and agility; what inspires them is the inner qualities of courage, perseverance, and wisdom. We look forward to seeing the Chinese athletes display their spiritual character in front of their hometown audience.

### 亚运会前的重要检阅——写在亚洲拳击大赛开幕之时

    亚运会前的重要检阅
    ——写在亚洲拳击大赛开幕之时
    亚洲的拳击运动水平在世界上虽不及欧美，但中小级别却时常捧得世界大赛金杯；此番前来参加第十四届亚洲业余拳击锦标赛的国家和地区虽不算多，但有能力问鼎奖牌的队伍却无一缺席。无疑，在北京仲夏举行的这场龙虎斗将成为明年亚运会之前的一次重要检阅。
    引人注目的首先是重新出山、雄心勃勃的中国队。自1986年重新在这块人口众多的土地上开展业余拳击运动以来，中国拳击水平提高很快，去年鼓足勇气走上奥运会赛台，竟然进入了前8名，颇有些一鸣惊人。越来越多的人认为，北京亚运会上中国的金牌榜上将会出现拳击选手的名字。甚至，中国拳击界人士现在就想领受亚洲冠军的荣誉了，王国钧教练曾经表示拿两三块金牌并非没有可能，拳击协会的官员，更明确地举出拿牌的四条依据：一，1987年以来中国选手在历届国际赛事上从未空手而归，总能拿些成色不同的奖牌；二，打击力量、抗击打能力、体力等项素质有明显提高；三，所提倡的“狠、拚、重、快”的作风已经初步形成；四，占有天时、地利、人和。显然，年轻的中国拳手们急欲在家乡父老面前表现一下自己的实力了。
    就整体实力而言，南朝鲜队恐怕是本届所有参赛队中最强的了。这次他们没有派来去年奥运会的选手，但据该队教练吴仁锡透露，这支平均年龄20岁出头的队伍基本上是明年亚运会选拔队的阵容，其中48公斤、51公斤、54公斤、57公斤级的选手都曾是地区性国际比赛的金牌得主，而63.5公斤级的金基泽曾经是世界杯得主。看来南朝鲜拳坛人才济济，兵强将勇，将是中国队最强劲的对手。
    此外，以欧式打法著称的蒙古队曾获奥运会铜牌，多次进入世界前8名，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国中小级别选手战绩赫赫，泰国拳击运动源远流长，都有可能杀入决赛。
    也许应该令我们格外关注的是大级别的对抗。大级别拳击在亚洲开展得相对来说不那么普遍，中国队曾将之做为称雄亚洲的突破口。但怀有此心的不只是中国队，这次巴基斯坦、印度等国家也派来了大级别的选手。
    拳击所吸引人的，在于力量、速度、敏捷等直观素质；它所感奋人的，在于勇气、毅力、智慧等内在品质。我们期待着中国健儿在家乡父老面前打出自己的精神风貌来。
