Fushun Introduces Italian Acrylonitrile Chlorofibre Production Line

	The contract for Fushun Organic Chemical Factory to introduce an acrylonitrile chlorofibre production line from Italy's SNIA company was signed in Shenyang on July 6. This project, with a total investment of 130 million yuan (including $14.66 million in foreign exchange), will produce 5,000 tons of acrylonitrile chlorofibre annually upon completion.

	Acrylonitrile chlorofibre products can be used to simulate natural animal fur, achieving a level of authenticity that is highly welcomed by various sectors. Due to the lack of domestic production, only 30% of the domestic demand can be met through imports each year.

    抚顺引进意腈氯纶装置
    本报讯　抚顺有机化工厂引进意大利SNIA公司腈氯纶生产装置的合同，七月六日在沈阳签署。这项总投资为一点三亿元人民币（包括一千四百六十六万美元外汇）的项目投产后，可年产腈氯纶五千吨。
    腈氯纶产品可用来仿制天然兽毛皮，达到以假乱真境地，备受各界欢迎。由于国内没有厂家生产，每年靠进口只能满足国内需求百分之三十。
