Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently emphasized: "Hard work and plain living are our tradition. Education on hard work and plain living must be strengthened in the future and should be maintained for sixty to seventy years."

At the time of commemorating the passing of the proletarian revolutionary and one of the founders and commanders of our army, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, we are reminded of the Commander-in-Chief's long-standing style of "hard work and plain living, closely connecting with the masses."

I have reviewed many historical documents, which record many moving deeds of the Commander-in-Chief:

In June 1946, Nationalist Air Force pilot Liu Shanzhen flew his plane to Yan'an to defect. After being warmly received by the Commander-in-Chief, Liu Shanzhen could not help but exclaim: "Your leaders are just like ordinary people."

In March 1960, the Commander-in-Chief returned to his hometown for a visit. After not seeing his fellow villagers for over 50 years, they joyfully said: "Commander-in-Chief, you have traveled all over the place, done so much, and become the Commander-in-Chief, but you still look like a farmer, just the same, you haven't changed!" The Commander-in-Chief smiled: "What is a Commander-in-Chief? Without the masses, without the people, what Commander-in-Chief is there!" Even after becoming the Commander-in-Chief, he still looked like a farmer, "just like an ordinary person," and for decades, he had "not changed." Such sincere and plain praise indeed highlights a truth: The Communist Party and its led army, is it not with wholeheartedly serving the people as its highest principle?

On May 23, 1942, during a speech at the Yan'an Literary and Art Symposium, the Commander-in-Chief talked about his experience: "I am a person from a background of the old army. I thought the Communist Party was good, so I went to Shanghai to find the Party. Later, in Germany, I was introduced by Zhou Enlai to join the Communist Party of China. 'I joined the proletariat, not to become a Commander-in-Chief. Later, after fighting for a long time and working for the proletariat for a long time, everyone saw that I could do it, so they pushed me to be the Commander-in-Chief.'"

The Commander-in-Chief once used two lines of poetry to describe himself, which were quite appropriate: "Years of battles, never leaving the saddle," "Only seeing a servant, not an official." Dong Biwu once gave him a poem: "Everyone says he is an extraordinary general, but upon seeing him, he does not seem like an official."

Not like an "official," but a servant in every way. Our Commander-in-Chief, with the heavy responsibility of being a commander, did not diminish his servant's demeanor. He was hardworking and plain living, humble and cautious, approachable and kind. As early as 1939, when the American journalist Edgar Snow first visited the revolutionary base in northern Shaanxi, he was amazed and praised: "This is a brilliant record of the most vivid life experiences that one could not imagine in many years—this is a story of daring and selflessness, a story of extraordinary bravery and wisdom, a story of incredible hardship, a story of great idealism that sacrifices personal enjoyment, wealth, and status for the freedom and liberation of a nation."

The Commander-in-Chief's character of "only seeing a servant, not an official" perfectly reflects the essence of a generation of Communists who maintain revolutionary youth and vitality, that is, whether there is an official position or not, whether the position is big or small, they are all servants of the people; they all possess the nature of an ordinary soldier and the style of hard work and plain living. The Commander-in-Chief often said: "I have no other requests, I only want to be a natural Communist Party member." He indeed qualifies as a "natural" party member. In the party's small group meetings, he was an ordinary party member; in the army, he was like an ordinary soldier; among the masses, he could appear in the guise of an ordinary laborer. During the long and arduous years, he, like the soldiers, ate coarse food and wore rough military clothes, living in thatched huts and earthen caves. During the Jinggangshan period, he went out to carry grain, earning the reputation of "Zhu De's carrying pole"; during the Yan'an period, he cultivated land and settled in the Nanluwan; after moving to Beijing, even though he was over seventy, he still carried a pole to build the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir. This "carrying pole spirit" and "Nanluwan spirit" always shone in the Commander-in-Chief.

The exemplary role and the power of example kept the people's army always maintaining the tradition of the old Red Army, with officers and soldiers united, military and civilians united, sharing weal and woe, and life and death together, possessing astonishing cohesion and tenacious fighting power. It is truly a steel wall loyal to the Party and the people.

    总司令的朴素作风
    ——史料新读有感
    艾克恩
    邓小平同志最近强调：“艰苦奋斗是我们的传统，艰苦朴素的教育今后要抓紧，一直要抓六十至七十年。”
    正值无产阶级革命家、我军创建者与指挥者之一朱德总司令逝世纪念之际，使我们想起朱总司令的一向“艰苦朴素、密切联系群众”的优良作风。
    我查阅了许多历史资料，那里记下了朱总司令的许多动人事迹：
    1946年6月间，国民党航空机长刘善本驾机起义抵延安，在受到朱总司令的亲切接见后，刘善本不禁惊奇地讲：“你们的领袖完全像普通人一样。”
    1960年3月，朱总司令返乡探亲，50多年不见的乡亲们惊喜地说：“总司令，你山南海北，走那么多地方，干这么大的事业，当了总司令，还是庄户人模样，老样子，没有变呀！”总司令笑了：“总司令是个啥子嘛！没有大家，没有群众，还有啥子总司令！”当了总司令，仍是“庄户人模样”，“像普通人一样”，几十年都“没有变”，如此坦诚而朴素的赞语，不恰好点明一个真理：共产党人及其领导的军队，不正是以全心全意为人民服务作为它的最高宗旨吗？
    1942年5月23日，朱总司令在延安文艺座谈会上讲话时就曾谈到他的这样一段经历：我是一个旧军人出身的人，我认为共产党好，便主动到上海去找党，随后在德国经周恩来介绍加入了中国共产党。“我投入无产阶级，并不是想来当总司令，后来打仗多了，为无产阶级作事久了，大家看我干得还可以，才推我当总司令的”。
    朱总司令曾用两句诗来写照他自己，也颇为恰当：“历年征战未离鞍”，“只见公仆不见官”。董必武也曾赠诗：“尽人传说非凡将，一见才知不似官。”
    是官不像“官”，公仆一身“公”。我们的总司令，身负司令重任，不减公仆本色。他，艰苦朴素，谦虚谨慎，平易近人，和蔼可亲。早在1939年，美国记者斯诺首访陕北革命根据地时，就曾惊奇地称赞道：“这是许多年不能想象的最最生动的人生经历的辉煌记录——这是一个大胆无畏和大公无私的故事，一个无比勇敢和智慧的故事，一个难以相信的苦难的故事，一个为着忠于一个民族的自由解放而斗争的伟大主义而丢弃个人享受、财富和地位的故事。”
    朱总司令“只见公仆不见官”的品格，恰好反映了一代共产党人永葆革命青春、永具旺盛生命力的所在，即不论有官无官，官大官小，同样都是人民的勤务员，人民的公仆；同样具有普通一兵的本色和艰苦朴素的作风。朱总常说：“我别无所求，只求做一个自自然然的共产党员。”他确实够得上是一个“自自然然”的党员了。在党的小组会上，他是普通党员；在军队里，他像普通战士；在群众当中，他能以普通劳动者姿态出现。在漫长的艰苦岁月里，他和战士一样，吃粗茶淡饭，穿粗布军衣，住草棚土窑。井冈山时期，他外出挑粮，有“朱德扁担”之美传；延安时期，他开荒种地，屯垦南泥湾；进京后，虽年逾古稀，仍挑起扁担修建十三陵水库。这种“扁担精神”、“南泥湾精神”，始终闪现在朱总身上。
    表率的作用，榜样的力量，使人民军队始终保持着老红军的传统，官兵一致，军民一致，同甘共苦，生死与共，具有惊人的凝聚力和顽强的战斗力，真不愧为一支忠于党、忠于人民的钢铁长城。
