The eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress was held this morning in the Great Hall of the People.

The meeting was presided over by Chairman Wan Li. He said that the quorum for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is 152 people, and 132 members attended today's meeting, meeting the statutory number.

The meeting, in accordance with Article 67, Item 10 of the Constitution and the request of Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China, decided after a vote by the members to remove Zhao Ziyang from the position of Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China.

At the meeting, members also listened to a report by State Councilor and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong, on behalf of the State Council, on the situation regarding the suppression of turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary riot. The report was divided into eight parts: 1. The brewing and premeditation of the turmoil have been long-standing; 2. The student movement was used by the instigators of the turmoil from the beginning; 3. The "April 26" editorial of the People's Daily correctly characterized the turmoil; 4. Comrade Zhao Ziyang's speech on May 4 was a turning point in the turmoil; 5. The use of hunger strikes to blackmail, making the turmoil more extensive; 6. The imposition of martial law in parts of Beijing was a necessary and correct measure; 7. How a small number of people incited the counter-revolutionary riot; 8. How the counter-revolutionary rioters brutalized the People's Liberation Army.

Chen Xitong said that from mid-April to early June this year, a small number of people used the student movement to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil, which then developed into a counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, Beijing. Their goal in instigating the turmoil and riot was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. In this struggle concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, Comrade Zhao Ziyang made serious errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party, bearing unshirkable responsibility for the formation and development of the turmoil. Faced with this extremely grave situation, the Party Central Committee made the correct decision and took a series of resolute measures, which were firmly supported by the entire Party and the people of all nationalities across the country. The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core, played an extremely important role in winning this struggle. The People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers made tremendous contributions to suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary riot. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals resolutely opposed the turmoil and riot, closely united around the Party Central Committee, and demonstrated a high level of political awareness and a sense of responsibility as masters of the country.

He said that with Tiananmen Square back in the hands of the people and the martial law troops fully in position, the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital was smashed in one fell swoop. In the process of quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers fearlessly fought bravely and established immortal merits. The masses rescued the wounded, saved the besieged soldiers, actively cooperated with and supported the martial law troops, and many touching good deeds emerged. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals are working hard to make up for the losses suffered. Now, the order in the capital has basically returned to normal, and the situation across the country has quickly stabilized, reflecting that the central government's correct decisions have been supported by the people of all nationalities across the country. However, the turmoil and riot have not been completely quelled, and a small number of counter-revolutionary rioters, unwilling to perish, are still carrying out various sabotage activities and even dreaming of a comeback.

He said that to achieve a complete victory in suppressing the turmoil and quelling the counter-revolutionary riot, we must mobilize the masses, strengthen people's democratic dictatorship, and carry out the work of investigating counter-revolutionary rioters to the end. We must thoroughly expose the conspiracies of the turmoil and riot, punish the organizers and planners of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot according to law, that is, those who have long stubbornly adhered to the stance of bourgeois liberalization and engaged in political intrigue, those who have colluded with hostile forces overseas and abroad, those who have provided the core secrets of the Party and the state to illegal organizations, and those who have committed various criminal acts such as beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing. We must strictly distinguish between and correctly handle two types of contradictions of different nature, through resolute, decisive, and painstaking work, concentrate on striking a small number of ringleaders and unrepentant diehards, and strive to expand the scope of education and unity. On this basis, relying on the broad masses, we will strive to produce more, practice strict economy, work hard, and make up for all the losses caused by the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot as soon as possible.

Chen Xitong said that our country's just struggle to suppress the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot has been understood and supported by many countries and peoples in the world. We express our heartfelt thanks for this. However, internationally, there are also some countries that distort the facts, spread rumors and slander, and even impose various so-called condemnations and sanctions on our country, stirring up an anti-China wave and grossly interfering in our internal affairs. We deeply regret this. To all external pressures, our government and people have never yielded in the past, will not yield now, and will never yield in the future. Rumors will be refuted, and the truth will eventually be revealed to the world. Our country will continue to adhere to the independent and peaceful foreign policy, continue to develop friendly relations with all countries in the world on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and continue to make our own contributions to maintaining world peace and promoting world development.

Vice Chairmen Hab Comrade Xi Zhongxun, Peng Chong, Zhu Lirang, Apu Angjinmei, Yan Jici, Rong Yiren, Ye Fei, Liao Hansheng, Ni Zhifu, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jiequn, Wang Hanbin attended the meeting.

The President of the Supreme People's Court, Ren Jianxin, and the Procurator-General of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, Liu Fuzhi, attended the meeting as non-voting participants.

    人大常委会举行全体会议
    决定撤销赵紫阳的中央军委副主席职务
    听取陈希同制止动乱平息暴乱情况报告
    新华社北京6月30日电　七届全国人大常委会第八次会议今天上午在人民大会堂举行全体会议。
    会议由万里委员长主持。他说，全国人大常委会议应到人数152人，出席今天会议的常委会委员132人，符合法定人数。
    会议根据宪法第六十七条第十项的规定和中华人民共和国中央军事委员会主席邓小平的提请，经过委员表决作出决定：撤销赵紫阳的中华人民共和国中央军事委员会副主席职务。
    会上，委员们还听取了国务委员、北京市市长陈希同受国务院委托所作关于制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的情况报告。报告分为八个部分：一、动乱的酝酿和预谋由来已久；二、学潮从一开始就被动乱的组织者所利用；三、《人民日报》“四·二六”社论对动乱的定性是正确的；四、赵紫阳同志“五四”讲话是动乱的转折点；五、以绝食相要挟，使动乱更加扩大；六、北京部分地区实行戒严是不得已而采取的正确措施；七、极少数人是怎样挑起反革命暴乱的；八、反革命暴徒是怎样残害解放军的。
    陈希同说，从今年4月中旬到6月上旬，极少数人利用学潮，掀起了一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在首都北京发展成了反革命暴乱。他们策动动乱和暴乱的目的，就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。在这场关系党和国家生死存亡的斗争中，赵紫阳同志犯了支持动乱和分裂党的严重错误，对动乱的形成和发展负有不可推卸的责任。在极其严峻的形势面前，党中央作出了正确的决策，采取了一系列果断措施，得到了全党和全国各族人民的坚决拥护。以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家，为赢得这场斗争的胜利发挥了极其重要的作用。中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警，为制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱作出了巨大的贡献。广大工人、农民、知识分子坚决反对动乱和暴乱，紧密团结在党中央周围，表现了很高的政治觉悟和主人翁责任感。
    他说，以天安门广场重新回到人民手中和戒严部队全部到位为标志，首都反革命暴乱被一举粉碎。在平息反革命暴乱的过程中，中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警不怕牺牲，英勇战斗，建立了不朽的功勋。人民群众救护伤员、解救被围困的战士、积极配合和支援戒严部队，涌现出许多动人心弦的好人好事。广大工人、农民、知识分子正在为挽回遭受的损失，进行艰苦的劳动。现在，首都各项秩序基本恢复正常，全国局势也较快地趋于平稳，这反映了中央的正确决策得到了全国各族人民的拥护。但是，动乱和暴乱尚未彻底平息，极少数反革命暴乱分子不甘心灭亡，仍在进行种种破坏活动，甚至梦想卷土重来。
    他说，为了取得制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利，我们要放手发动群众，加强人民民主专政，把清查反革命暴乱分子的工作进行到底。要彻底揭露动乱和暴乱的阴谋，依法惩处动乱和反革命暴乱的组织者和策划者，即那些长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场和搞政治阴谋的人，同海外、国外敌对势力相勾结的人，向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人，以及制造打、砸、抢、烧、杀等种种暴行的刑事犯罪分子。要严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，通过坚决果断、艰苦细致的工作，集中打击极少数首恶分子和拒不改悔的顽固分子，尽力扩大教育面和团结面。在此基础上，依靠广大群众，努力增产，厉行节约，艰苦奋斗，尽快把动乱和反革命暴乱造成的损失全部夺回来。
    陈希同说，我国制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的正义斗争，得到了世界上许多国家政府和人民的理解和支持。对此，我们表示衷心的感谢。但是，在国际上也有一些国家，歪曲事实真相，进行造谣中伤，甚至对我国实行种种的所谓谴责和制裁，掀起反华浪潮，粗暴干涉我国内政。对此，我们深表遗憾。对于一切外来压力，我国政府和人民过去没有屈服过，现在不会屈服，永远不会屈服。谣言必将破产，真相终将大白于天下。我国将一如既往地坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续发展同世界各国的友好关系，为维护世界和平和促进世界发展继续作出自己的贡献。
    副委员长习仲勋、彭冲、朱学范、阿沛·阿旺晋美、严济慈、荣毅仁、叶飞、廖汉生、倪志福、费孝通、孙起孟、雷洁琼、王汉斌，出席了会议。
    最高人民法院院长任建新、最高人民检察院检察长刘复之，列席会议。
