Our unit has ten new recruits from Tuan Shanzi Township, Yilan County, Heilongjiang. This year, the township had thirty-eight eligible young men sign up for military service. Surprisingly, the township military department charged each recruit forty yuan for the registration fee and fifty yuan for the physical examination fee. The ten new recruits who came to our unit also had to pay an additional one hundred fifty yuan for service fees. One of the new recruits is an orphan and had to borrow money from relatives and friends to pay these fees, arriving at the unit with a heavy debt.

    适龄青年应征入伍武装部让交服役费
    我部有十名新兵是从黑龙江依兰县团山子乡入伍的。今年，这个乡有三十八名适龄青年报名应征入伍。令人不解的是，乡武装部竟让每个应征青年交纳四十元报名费、五十元体检费。到我部入伍的十名新兵还交了一百五十元服役费。有个新兵是个孤儿，只好从亲友处借钱交纳这些费用，背着一身债来到部队。
