Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 28th.

China's first elevated roadway floating bridge was recently completed and opened to traffic in the suburbs of Shanghai.

The bridge is 219 meters long and 9.33 meters wide. Two floating piers, each consisting of 22 floating boxes, ensure that ships can pass underneath without obstruction. The bridge was constructed in just seven months with a total investment of 3.6 million yuan. In contrast, a conventional bridge of the same length would typically take two years to build and require eight times the investment. This floating bridge is the first application of a railway emergency research achievement in local construction.

The completion of this bridge has enabled the only previously unserved suburban area of Shanghai to have a public bus route.

    沪建成高架公路浮桥
    新华社上海7月28日电　我国第一座高架公路浮桥日前在上海郊区建成通车。
    这座浮桥全长219米，桥宽9.33米。两座浮墩各由22只浮箱组成，桥下可保证船只正常通行。浮桥仅用7个月时间建成，总投资360万元；而同样长的一般桥梁则需要2年左右才能建成，投资要比现在多8倍。这座浮桥是铁路战备科研成果首次应用于地方建设。
    这座浮桥使上海郊区唯一不通公交汽车的乡开通了公交线路。
