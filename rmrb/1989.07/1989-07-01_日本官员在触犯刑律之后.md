To prevent and monitor government officials from committing illegal and disciplinary offenses, Japan has not only established a series of supervisory bodies but also formulated a series of clean governance systems. This ensures that the official duties and the exercise of various powers by government officials are strictly constrained by laws and regulations. If they violate criminal laws, they can be promptly dealt with according to the law.

If Japanese officials neglect their duties, they generally face four types of penalties: warning, suspension of salary, suspension from duty, and dismissal. Those who are dismissed lose all rights associated with their original position immediately, are not eligible for any retirement allowances, and are not allowed to take up other positions or participate in civil service examinations for two years. If they personally violate criminal laws, they are punished according to the criminal law, "equal to common citizens," with no exceptions. If they use their official positions to accept bribes, forge official documents, or violate criminal laws, they are punished more severely according to special regulations than ordinary citizens, as a deterrent to others.

When government officials commit crimes or serious derelictions of duty, in addition to holding the individuals responsible, their supervising department heads are also held accountable. For example, in 1979, after a fire at the Tokyo University Faculty of Letters, not only were the directly responsible individuals penalized by having their salaries deducted, but the Minister of Education also publicly apologized to the Japanese people. In February 1980, after it was revealed that a retired Self-Defense Forces general, Miyanaga, had provided military intelligence to the Soviet KGB, Miyanaga was imprisoned, and the Director-General of the Defense Agency, Kubota, resigned.

The Japanese "National Public Service Law" stipulates that if the conduct of public officials violates criminal law, according to the principle of "criminal proceedings first," criminal responsibility should be pursued first, and dismissal penalties should not be used to replace criminal penalties. In 1988, the Recruit stock scandal broke out, and Finance Minister Miyazawa Kiichi, who was involved in the case, submitted his resignation on December 9. The Tokyo District Prosecutors Office filed charges against Miyazawa and other related individuals. Since then, several members of the Japanese cabinet have resigned, and Prime Minister Takeshita also stepped down.

    日本官员在触犯刑律之后
    为了防止和监督政府官员违法乱纪，日本不仅设立了一系列监督机构，而且制定了一系列廉政制度，从而使政府官员的政务活动和对各种权力的行使，严格置于法规、制度的约束之下，一旦触犯刑律，亦能及时依法得到查处。
    日本官员若玩忽职守，所受的处分一般有4种：警告、停发工资、停职和免职。被免职者即日起失去原职务的一切权利，不得领取任何退职津贴，并在两年内不得改任他职或参加公务员任用考试。其中，若以个人身份触犯刑律的，根据刑法规定论罪量刑，“与庶民同罪”，不得例外；如果是利用职务之便，收受贿赂，伪造公文，触犯刑法的，则按照特别法规规定，较一般平民加重刑罚，以儆效尤。
    政府机构的官员犯罪或出现重大失职行为，除追究当事者的责任外，还将追究其主管部门首脑的领导责任。例如，1979年东京大学文学部失火，不仅对有关直接责任者作了扣发工资的处分，而且政府文部大臣也在报上向日本国民作了自我检查。1980年2月，日本自卫队退休将领宫永向苏联克格勃提供军事情报一事被揭露出来后，宫永锒铛入狱，防卫厅长官久保田亦引咎辞职。
    日本《国家公务员法》规定，公职人员的行为如触犯刑法，根据“刑事先理”的原则，应首先追究刑事责任，决不能以免职处分代替刑事处罚。1988年，里库路特股票丑闻事发，大藏大臣宫泽喜一因卷入此案于12月9日提出辞呈，东京地方检察当局对宫泽等有关人员提出起诉。自此日本内阁数位成员先后倒台，竹下登首相亦辞职。
