The Ministry of Health, the National Hygiene and Health Committee, the State Education Commission, and the Ministry of Culture, along with six other ministries and commissions, recently issued a joint notice designating September 20 of each year as National "Love Your Teeth Day."

Dental diseases are common and widespread. The World Health Organization lists dental caries as one of the three major diseases to be prioritized for prevention and treatment worldwide. Due to the late start of dental disease prevention and treatment work in our country, the prevention and treatment efforts are quite weak. The public lacks basic knowledge of dental health, and the task of preventing and treating dental diseases is extremely arduous. The launch of "Love Your Teeth Day" activities will promote prevention and treatment efforts.

    九部委确定九月二十日为全国“爱牙日”
    本报北京7月23日讯 卫生部、全国爱卫会、国家教委和文化部等九部委日前联合发出通知，确定每年9月20日为全国“爱牙日”。
    牙病是一种常见病、多发病。世界卫生组织把龋齿列为世界重点防治的三大疾病之一。由于我国牙病防治工作起步较晚，防治工作十分薄弱，群众缺乏牙齿保健的基本知识，牙病防治的任务极其繁重。“爱牙日”活动的开展，将推动防治工作。　（伊正）
