Icelandic Prime Minister Hermannsson Demands Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from Iceland

	New York Times, June 30th - According to a report from the U.S. military newspaper "Stars and Stripes," Icelandic Prime Minister Hermannsson has demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in Iceland.

	Hermannsson said in an interview with the newspaper's reporter that he hopes the U.S. troops stationed in Iceland will withdraw and return home as soon as possible.

	Currently, there are approximately 3,200 U.S. military personnel stationed at the Keflavik base. A month ago, the commander of the U.S. forces in Iceland, McWaden, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Icelandic government's "ingratitude" towards the U.S. troops, which has sparked anti-American sentiment in Iceland.

    冰岛首相要求美军撤离冰岛
    新华社华盛顿六月三十日电　据美军“星条报”今天报道，冰岛首相赫尔曼松要求撤走驻冰岛的美国军队。
    赫尔曼松在接受该报记者采访时说，他盼望驻冰岛美军早日撤离回国。
    目前约有三千二百名美军事人员驻扎在凯夫拉维克基地。驻冰岛美军司令麦克瓦登一个月前曾流露出冰岛当局对美军“忘恩负义”，激起了冰岛的反美情绪。
