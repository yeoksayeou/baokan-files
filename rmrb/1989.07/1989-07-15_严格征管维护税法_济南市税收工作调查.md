In recent years, tax evasion and avoidance have become a serious issue in China's economic life. In 1988 alone, the nationwide tax and financial audit uncovered and recovered 6.73 billion yuan in evaded taxes. Strengthening tax collection and enforcement, and stopping tax evasion and avoidance, is a complex and challenging task. This article introduces some practices of the tax authorities in Jinan City in tax collection and enforcement. Through strict collection and enforcement, they have upheld the seriousness of tax laws, supported production, and increased tax revenue for the state.

Changing Collection Methods and Standardizing Tax Procedures

A private business owner in Pingyin County had serious tax evasion issues. Dissatisfied with the tax bureau's adjustment of his tax burden, he gathered a group of people to vandalize the tax office and assault tax officials. After the incident, the Pingyin County Tax Bureau sued the law enforcement department, and although the individual was detained, the tax evasion issue remained unresolved because the tax bureau used oral consultations to determine taxes, lacking legal certification and reporting procedures. The individual insisted, "The tax was set by the tax office; I paid whatever they said. How is that tax evasion?"

This incident made the tax officials in Jinan City realize that the old collection model was no longer suitable for economic development and needed to be reformed.

At the beginning of last year, the Pingyin County Tax Bureau, under the jurisdiction of Jinan City, implemented a new method for collecting taxes from individual businesses. This method involved "tax assessment, tax declaration, and taxpayers going to the tax bureau to pay taxes." The results showed that the tax collection for individual businesses in the county improved significantly, with 94% of individual businesses paying taxes on time, and the annual individual and commercial tax revenue increasing by 50% compared to the previous year. The Jinan City Tax Bureau promptly summarized the experience of the Pingyin County Tax Bureau and promoted it throughout the city.

Having taxpayers truthfully declare and pay taxes themselves increases their psychological pressure if they provide false information, as it constitutes tax evasion. Therefore, the taxes they declared were, on average, more than 10% higher than the previous oral consultations. Taxpayers coming to the tax bureau to pay taxes also allowed tax collection officers to have more time for investigations and verifications, changing their work from passive to active, and continuously increasing the collected tax revenue. Last year, the individual and commercial tax collection reached 62.23 million yuan, a 27.7% increase from the previous year; and from January to May this year, it increased by 29.38% compared to the same period last year.

Separating Collection, Management, and Inspection to Strengthen the Supervision Mechanism

Implementing the separation of "collection, management, and inspection" is another important measure taken by Jinan City to strictly enforce tax collection. This change transformed the previous practice of "one officer handling all taxes in a factory, with all taxes managed and collected by one line of personnel" into three parts: tax collection, tax management, and tax inspection, each handled by different personnel. This created a mechanism where internal and external supervision is both relatively independent and mutually reinforcing, forming a scientific and institutionalized tax collection system. This reform effectively prevented tax evasion and avoidance, making tax collection increasingly scientific and institutionalized.

Firstly, implementing the separation of "collection, management, and inspection" clearly defines the responsibilities of tax officials, reducing their workload and allowing them to focus on their respective tasks. Those in charge of collection can concentrate on tax guidance, while those in charge of inspection can focus on auditing without being burdened by collection duties.

Secondly, implementing the separation of "collection, management, and inspection" effectively serves as an internal check. In the past, there were often issues of subjective and arbitrary decisions by tax collection officers. Now, with clear responsibilities, the phenomenon of one person's word being final has been eliminated. In previous financial and tax audits, some enterprises would seek favors from tax collection officers, and out of face-saving, some officers would quietly let them off. Now, tax collection officers do not interfere with inspections, and inspectors have minimal contact with enterprises, allowing both sides to work independently.

Establishing a Monitoring Network for Strict Tax Supervision

Ensuring that national tax interests are not infringed upon requires more than just the efforts of the tax authorities. The Jinan City Tax Bureau, in improving tax collection and management, adopted an internal and external approach, strengthening tax collection through various channels. With the support of the municipal party committee and government, they actively coordinated with public security, procuratorate, and judicial departments, establishing "procuratorate offices" in tax bureaus at various districts and counties, staffed by procuratorate and tax bureau officials. These offices operate on the principle of "investigating cases when there are cases, assisting in tax collection when there are no cases, and combining tax collection with case investigation to clear both taxes and cases." Over the past year, they have handled 385 cases of serious tax evasion and assaults on tax authorities, recovering direct economic losses of 4.317 million yuan for the state.

The Jinan City Tax Bureau also established a key tax source information network for 22 large enterprises that contribute more than 60% of the annual tax revenue and have an annual tax payment of over 500 million yuan. They implemented a regular reporting system, analyzing the tax situation of each enterprise to ensure the collection of key tax sources. Last year, these 22 large enterprises increased their tax revenue by 21.67% compared to the previous year, and this year, they have seen a significant increase again.

    严格征管维护税法
    ——济南市税收工作调查
    新华社记者  卢殿洛  新华社通讯员  王大建
    近年来，偷税漏税已成为我国经济生活中的一个严重问题，仅1988年全国开展的税收财务大检查，就查补偷漏税款67.3亿元。而强化税收征管，制止偷税漏税行为，具有很大的难度和复杂性。这里介绍的是济南市税务部门在税收征管方面的一些做法。他们用严格的征管，维护了税法的严肃性，既支持了生产，又为国家增加了税收。
    改变征管办法规范纳税程序
    平阴县一个个体户有严重的偷税行为，他因对税务机关调整税负不满，纠集人打砸税务所办公室，殴打税务干部。事发后，平阴县税务局起诉执法部门，虽对这个个体户进行了拘留，但在偷税问题上，因税务机关定税采用口头座谈方式，缺乏法定的鉴定和申报手续。当事人一口咬定：“税是税务所定的，让我交多少我交多少，怎么是偷税？”旧的“座谈定税、登门催税”的征管办法，在客观上给偷漏税，甚至抗税者以可乘之机。
    事实使济南市税务干部认识到旧的征管模式已远远不适应经济发展的要求，必须进行变革。
    去年初，市所属平阴县税务局对个体业户的征管，试行了新办法，即对个体业户“实行纳税鉴定，纳税申报和纳税人到税务机关交税”的办法。实践结果，全县个体业户税收征管出现了新局面，94％的个体业户在纳税期内到税务机关交税，全年个体工商税收比上年增加了50％。济南市税务局及时总结了平阴县税务局的经验，在全市加以推广。
    由纳税人自己实事求是地申报纳税，如有不实就构成偷税，这就增加了纳税人心理压力。因此，他们申报的税负，平均比以往座谈定税高出10％以上。纳税人上门交税，也使税收专管员有更多的时间搞调查、核实，工作由被动变主动，所征税款不断增加。去年个体工商税完成6223万元，比上年增长27.7％；今年1至5月又比去年同期增长29.38％。
    征、管、查分离强化制约机制
    实行“征、管、查”分离，是济南市严格税收征管的又一重要措施。它将以往“一员进厂、各税统管、征管查一条线”的做法，改为税款征收、税收管理和税收检查三部分，分别由有关人员分工负责，在全面强化征管的基础上，提高检查环节的监督作用，形成既相对独立，又相互促进，相互制约的内外部监控机制。这一改革，有效地防止了偷漏税行为，使税收征管逐步做到科学化、制度化。
    首先，实行“征、管、查”分离，各有分工，税务人员各自的工作范围缩小，工作内容相对集中，搞征管的集中精力搞好税收辅导，搞检查的也可以从繁重的征管事务中解脱出来，专心致志地把帐查清楚。
    其次，实行“征、管、查”分离，有效地起到了对内制约的作用。过去在征管中常出现专管员主观武断的问题。如今，有关人员各司其职，消除个人说了算的现象。往年每到财税检查，总有些企业找专管员说情，专管员考虑到与企业的关系，碍于面子，有的就悄悄放行。现在征管人员不管检查的事，搞检查的又与企业平时没多少联系，双方都可放手工作。
    建立监控网络严格税务监督
    落实以法治税，保证国家税收利益不受侵犯，光靠税务部门的力量是不够的。济南市税务部门在完善稽征管理工作中，实行内外结合，通过多种渠道加强征管。在市委、市政府的支持下，他们主动与公、检、法等部门联系，在各区县税务局设立了由检察院和税务局干部参加的“检察室”。检察室本着“有案办案，无案协税，协税带案，案税两清”的工作原则，把日常的检察活动与税收征管工作有机结合起来。一年多来，已查处严重偷漏税和冲击税务机关、殴打税务人员的犯罪案例385起，为国家挽回直接经济损失431.7万元。
    济南市税务局还将税收占全年60％以上、年纳税额在500万元以上的22户大企业建立了重点税源信息网，建立定期报告制度，逐户分析税收情况，保证了重点税源的收缴入库。去年这22户大企业完成的税收比上年增长21.67％，今年又比去年有较大的增长。（本报约新华社专稿）
