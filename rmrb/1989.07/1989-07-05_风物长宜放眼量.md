It is reported that the chairman of the China subcommittee of the East Asia Economic Committee of the Federal Republic of Germany, Weiss, recently urged companies in his country to consider their relationships with China from a long-term perspective, taking into account several years and even decades.

Weiss's suggestion is quite insightful. By considering the long term, one should view things and handle issues with a long-term perspective, avoiding hasty actions that may lead to unfavorable consequences. During the turmoil and suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, some people were temporarily confused by the chaotic situation and influenced by various rumors, leading them to leave China. After Beijing restored order, they gradually understood the truth and are now or will soon return to work in China. Their actions are welcomed by the relevant departments in China. Some foreign personnel, undisturbed by the external situation, continued to work in Beijing, which is even more commendable. They all consider the long-term interests and believe that China will adhere to the policy of reform and opening up.

Reform and opening up is China's long-term strategy for becoming prosperous, not a temporary measure. The suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion was a temporary disruption to our steps, but the effective policies of reform and opening up will not change. The doors that have been opened will not be closed, but will be opened even wider. China's development mainly relies on its own strength, but under the current conditions of the global economy being more interdependent, further developing trade and economic and technological cooperation with foreign countries not only serves China's long-term fundamental interests but also contributes to the development and peace of the world. Therefore, despite some people threatening China with various sanctions, many enlightened individuals still hope to develop economic and trade relations with China. Facts will ultimately prove that this is indeed a wise decision.

One should view things with a long-term perspective. Short-sightedness is unwise and ineffective. As for those who use excuses to pressure China and interfere in China's internal affairs, they are miscalculating and will ultimately be in vain.

    风物长宜放眼量
    报载，联邦德国经济东方委员会中国小组主席魏斯近日要求该国的公司在考虑同中国的关系时，必须从长计议，要从几年和几十年考虑同这个国家的关系。
    魏斯的这个建议颇有见地。所谓从长计议，就是要用长远的眼光看待事物和处理问题，避免贸然从事带来不利的后果。在北京发生动乱和平息反革命暴乱期间，有一些人士一时对纷乱的局势不大清楚，又受了许多谣言的影响暂时离开中国。在北京恢复正常秩序之后，他们逐步明白了事情的真相，正在或将陆续返回中国工作。他们的行动受到中方有关部门的欢迎。一些外方人员不受外界局势的困扰，继续留在北京工作，更属难能可贵。他们都从长远利益考虑问题相信中国是会坚持改革开放政策的。
    改革开放是中国走向富强之路的长远大计，而非权宜之策。中国平息反革命暴乱期间只是不得已而暂时打乱了我们的步子，而改革开放的一系列行之有效的政策则是不会改变，已经打开的门不会关小，而且会更加敞开。中国的发展主要依靠自己的力量，但在当今世界经济更加相互依存的条件下，进一步发展中国同外国的贸易和经济技术合作关系，不仅符合中国长远的根本利益，而且对世界的发展与和平也将是一种贡献。正因为如此，尽管有人对中国以种种制裁相威胁，但是很多有识之士还是希望同中国发展经济和贸易关系。事实终究将会证明，这确实是明智之举。
    风物长宜放眼量。目光短浅是不明智的，于事无补。至于那些找借口对中国施加压力，对中国的内部事务指手划脚的人，则是打错了算盘，终将徒劳。  ·立中·
