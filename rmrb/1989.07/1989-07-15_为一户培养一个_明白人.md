Over the past few years, agriculture has stagnated, and as a deputy secretary in charge of agriculture, I am extremely worried. I often ponder this question: Under the premise of having the correct agricultural policies, what is the key factor in promoting agricultural development?

With this question in mind, in the spring of 1988, I conducted a survey in the countryside. In Li Jia Gou Village, Yang Liu Zhuang Township, there is an over-200-year-old old pear tree. Because the contractor understands scientific management, since 1983, the annual pear yield has been over 1,500 kilograms. In Shi Lang Zhuang Village, Feng Zhuang Township, the annual income from raising chickens is 9 million yuan, accounting for 47% of the village's total income. The reason is that every household understands how to select good breeds, raise chicks, prevent chicken diseases, and improve egg-laying rates and other scientific knowledge. In Xin Zhuang Zi Village, Shai Jia Tuo Township, the practice of two-year, four-crop rotation for peanuts, wheat, and corn has been implemented, with an annual net income of 640 yuan per mu, which is 300 yuan higher than the economic benefits of single-crop farming or peanuts.

Zheng Zhuang Township is a poor and remote area with inconvenient transportation, but there is a farmer named Shen Jie Min who relies on scientific vegetable cultivation to have an annual net income of over 150,000 yuan. These scientific and technological typical cases, compared to the vast number of farmers who rely on traditional and experiential methods, the economic benefits are vastly different, which surprised me and made me realize that although there are many factors constraining agricultural development, under the premise of correct policies, science and technology are the key. The future of agriculture lies in whether farmers can master scientific and technological knowledge.

How can farmers master scientific and technological knowledge? Which technologies should they master? Based on reality, we proposed the guiding ideology of "cultivating a knowledgeable person for every household," that is, let those who grow grain know how to increase yield, let those who raise pigs know how to make pigs grow faster and reach the market earlier, and let those who plant fruit trees know how to make fruit trees bear more fruit. In other words, let every household have someone who can master the application technologies in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery. This requirement is not high and is feasible. It is suitable for the reality of many illiterates and low cultural level in rural areas, and also fits the characteristic of China's agriculture, which is mainly operated by farmers in a dispersed manner. It can also see results relatively quickly. Cultivating knowledgeable people is very much in line with the farmers' tastes. For example, every household raises pigs, but most use old methods, taking more than a year to reach the market. If you teach them fast fattening, they can reach the market in five and a half months. Wouldn't they welcome it?

Luan County is an agricultural county with poor natural conditions. The county party committee and government are determined to carry out the work of "cultivating a knowledgeable person for every household" to the end. When the day comes that all 110,000 households in the county have knowledgeable people in science and technology, that will be the day when Luan County's agriculture takes off!

    为一户培养一个“明白人”
    高树栋
    近几年来农业徘徊不前，我这个管农业的副书记焦虑万分。我常常思考这样一个问题：在有了正确的农业政策的前提下，促使农业发展的关键因素是什么？
    带着这个问题，1988年春，我到农村搞了一番调查。杨柳庄乡李家沟村有一株200多年的老梨树，由于承包者明白科学管理，1983年以来，年产梨都在1500公斤以上。冯庄乡石郎庄村年养鸡收入90万元，占全村总收入的47％，其原因在于户户明白选良种、育雏，预防鸡病和如何提高产蛋率等科学知识。晒甲坨乡新庄子村推行花生、小麦、玉米两年四熟倒茬轮作制，每亩地年纯收入达640元，比单一种植粮食或花生的经济效益高300元。
    郑庄乡是穷乡僻壤，交通不便，可有个叫申介民的农民，靠科学种菜，一年纯收入1.5万多元。这些靠科技的典型与众多的靠传统靠经验的农户，经济效益相差悬殊，令我吃惊，也使我明白了这样一个道理，即制约农业发展的因素虽然很多，但在政策正确的前提下，科技是关键。农业的前途在于科学技术能不能为农民所掌握。
    如何让农民掌握科学技术？让他们掌握哪些技术？我们根据实际，提出了“培养一户一个明白人”的指导思想，即让种粮食的知道怎样才能提高产量，让养猪的明白怎样使猪长得快出栏早，让栽果树的明白怎样使果树多结果。也就是说让每一个农户都有人能掌握农、林、牧、渔等方面的使用技术。这个要求不高，而且可行，既符合农村文盲多、农民文化水平低的实际情况，也适合我国农业以农民分散经营为主的经营特点，还可以较快见到成效。培养明白人，很对农民的口味，比如，户户都养猪，可多数用老方法，1年多才出栏，你交给他快速育肥，5个半月就可出栏，他能不欢迎？
    滦县是农业为主的县，而且自然条件差。我们县委、县政府决心把“培养一户一个明白人”的工作抓到底。全县11万农户，家家都有了明白科技的人之日，那就是滦县农业腾飞之时！
