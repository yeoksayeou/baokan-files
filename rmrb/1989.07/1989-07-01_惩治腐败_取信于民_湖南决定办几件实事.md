The Hunan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government are earnestly implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They have decided to take concrete actions to punish corruption and gain public trust.

From June 28 to June 29, the Hunan Provincial Party Committee held a meeting attended by party officials from the province, prefectures, and counties. The meeting focused on studying and discussing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee and formulating specific measures for implementation. In terms of punishing corruption, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have decided to focus on the following tasks in the near future:

First, thoroughly clean up and rectify companies. All companies that should be dissolved will be dissolved. Party and government officials holding concurrent positions in companies must resign from these positions; otherwise, they will be removed from their administrative posts. After cleaning up the companies run by various levels of government agencies, those approved to remain must completely separate their finances and resources from the agencies within a specified period. Those who violate this rule will have their assets confiscated and handed over to the treasury, and the main responsible persons will be held accountable. For illegal and disciplinary issues uncovered during the cleanup, regardless of who is involved, they will be strictly handled according to party discipline, administrative discipline, and legal provisions. For children of provincial and prefectural-level leaders working in foreign-related departments, stricter requirements will be enforced. Those with illegal and disciplinary behavior will be severely dealt with according to the law, and no one will be protected or indulged.

Second, seriously investigate and handle the issue of party and government officials building private houses. In the past two years, more than 20,000 party and government officials across the province have built or planned to build private houses. Although some cleanup work has been done in various places in the past, the progress has been uneven, and the handling has not been serious and thorough. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government require all places to seriously and promptly complete the investigation by the end of September.

Third, resolutely curb the practice of entertaining and giving gifts. All party and government officials at all levels in the province, when on official business within the province, including inspections, guidance, and research at subordinate units and enterprises, are strictly prohibited from using public funds for banquets, providing cigarettes, alcoholic beverages, and fruits, or accompanying meals. The practice of individual dining is encouraged, and catering fees should be paid according to regulations. Those who violate these rules will be criticized, exposed, and may face disciplinary actions. All party and government agencies at all levels are strictly prohibited from using public funds to give gifts or distribute souvenirs. Such expenses will not be reimbursed by the financial department. Economic losses will be compensated by the responsible person who decided to give the gifts, and serious cases will face disciplinary actions. At the same time, it is strictly forbidden to accept personal gifts. Gifts that cannot be returned must be handed over to the public; those who hide and do not hand over gifts will be fined double the value of the gifts if discovered. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government will make specific regulations for officials of provincial agencies and request all places to supervise and implement them.

Fourth, closely connect with the masses and genuinely improve leadership styles. Leaders at all levels should go deep into reality, listen to the voices of the masses, and help solve urgent and difficult problems in production and life. Provincial-level leaders should travel lightly when conducting investigations and research at the grassroots level, avoid formalism, and avoid layer-by-layer accompaniment and welcoming ceremonies.

    惩治腐败　取信于民
    湖南决定办几件实事
    本报长沙6月30日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省委、省政府认真贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神，决定认真地办几件惩治腐败的实事，以取信于民，
    6月28日至6月29日，中共湖南省委召开了有省、地、县党员负责干部参加的会议，认真传达学习党的十三届四中全会精神，并联系湖南省实际讨论、研究具体的贯彻措施。在惩治腐败方面，省委、省政府决定，在近期内，突出抓好以下几件事：
    一是彻底清理整顿公司。凡是应当撤销的公司，要坚决撤销。党政机关干部在公司兼职的，必须脱钩，否则免除其行政职务；各级机关办的公司清理后，批准保留的，必须限期在财务和物资上与机关彻底脱钩。违者，除没收上交财政外，并追究主要负责人的责任。对清理出来的违法违纪问题，不管涉及到谁，都要坚决按党纪政纪法纪严肃处理。对在涉外部门工作的省、地级领导干部子女，更要严格要求，有违法乱纪行为的，必须严肃依法处理，任何人都不得包庇迁就。
    二是严肃查处党政干部营建私房的问题。近两年来，全省有两万多名党政机关干部营建和筹建私房。前段时间各地作了一些清理工作，但进展很不平衡，处理也不够严肃认真。省委、省政府要求各地认真抓紧，在9月底前全清查完毕。
    三是坚决刹请客送礼风。全省各级党政机关干部在省内执行公务，包括到下属单位、企业检查指导工作，调查研究等，一律不准用公款宴请，不准上烟酒饮料和水果，不准陪餐，提倡实行分餐制，并按规定交纳伙食费。违者应予批评、通报直至纪律处分。各级党政机关单位一律不准用公款赠送礼品，发放纪念品。违者财务部门不予报销。经济损失由决定赠送的负责人赔偿，情节严重的，给予纪律处分。同时严禁个人受礼，确属不能退回的礼品，一律交公；隐瞒不交的，查出后按礼品实际价格加倍处罚。省委、省政府将对省直机关干部作出具体的规定，请各地监督执行。
    四是密切联系群众，切实改进领导作风。各级领导都要深入实际，倾听群众呼声，帮助群众解决生产生活中的急难问题。省级领导干部下基层调查研究时，要轻车简从，不搞形式主义。下边也不要层层陪同，不要迎来送往。
