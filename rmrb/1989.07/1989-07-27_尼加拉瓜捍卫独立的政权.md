Nicaragua's people have undergone a decade of arduous struggles since they overthrew the Somoza dictatorship on July 19, 1979, in defending their revolutionary achievements, consolidating the new government, and developing the national economy.

Soon after the Sandinista National Liberation Front led the people to seize power, the United States began to fund and arm the remnants of the former regime, launching a "low-intensity war" against Nicaragua. To strangle the new Nicaraguan government, starting in 1981, the United States repeatedly provided military aid, both openly and secretly, to the Nicaraguan counter-revolutionary forces. This support enabled them to attack Nicaragua's military and economic targets, disrupting social stability. Over the past eight years, the U.S. has provided more than $500 million in military aid to the Nicaraguan counter-revolutionaries and conducted 70 large-scale military exercises aimed at Nicaragua.

The U.S. actions, however, did not subdue the Nicaraguan people. Under the leadership of the Sandinista National Liberation Front, they resolutely and forcefully struck back against the counter-revolutionary activities and U.S. military threats. Starting in May 1985, the U.S. imposed an economic and trade blockade on Nicaragua, but this too failed to topple the Nicaraguan government.

Over the past decade, the war has claimed over 50,000 lives in Nicaragua and caused direct and indirect economic losses of over $12 billion. Large swathes of farmland lie fallow, and tens of thousands of people have been forced to seek livelihoods abroad. To overcome these difficulties, the Nicaraguan government, while uniting the people to defend the new government, has continuously adjusted economic policies and taken a series of measures to encourage production, particularly the production of export goods. Additionally, the government has significantly reduced public expenditures and controlled the money supply, achieving initial success in controlling high inflation. The monthly inflation rate has dropped from 126% in December 1988 to 15.5% in May 1989. Exports of coffee, meat, and seafood have also increased compared to the previous year.

In recent years, the Nicaraguan government has taken concrete steps towards national reconciliation and advancing the democratic process within the country. These steps include direct negotiations with counter-revolutionary forces, dialogues with opposition parties, the abolition of press censorship, the release of military and political personnel from the Somoza regime, the amendment of election laws, and the announcement of early elections. These actions have further improved Nicaragua's international image. However, due to the U.S.'s relentless efforts to overthrow the current Nicaraguan government and its repeated obstruction of the implementation of relevant Central American peace agreements, the Nicaraguan people still face severe challenges in defending their sovereignty and building their nation.

    尼加拉瓜捍卫独立的政权
    新华社记者　宋心德　耿秋战
    尼加拉瓜人民自1979年7月19日推翻索摩查独裁统治后，在捍卫革命成果、巩固新生政权和发展民族经济方面走过了10年的艰难历程。
    尼加拉瓜桑地诺民族解放阵线领导人民夺取政权不久，美国便出钱出枪，支持和组织前政权的残余势力，对尼加拉瓜发动了一场“低烈度战争”。为了扼杀尼加拉瓜新政权，自1981年起，美国一再公开或秘密地向尼加拉瓜反政府武装提供军事援助，支持他们袭击尼加拉瓜的军事和经济目标，破坏社会安定。8年多来，美国向尼反政府武装提供的军援达5亿美元之多，共举行针对尼的大规模军事演习70次。
    美国的这些行动并未能使尼加拉瓜人民屈服。他们在桑地诺民族解放阵线的领导下，对反政府武装活动和美国的军事威胁给予了坚决有力的回击。1985年5月起，美国又对尼加拉瓜实行经济贸易封锁，但也未能搞垮尼加拉瓜政府。
    10年来，尼加拉瓜因战争造成5万多人死亡，直接和间接的经济损失达120多亿美元。全国大片农田荒芜，成千上万人被迫到国外谋生。为克服困难，尼加拉瓜政府在团结人民保卫新生政权的同时，还不断调整经济政策，采取一系列措施，鼓励发展生产，特别是出口产品的生产。另外，政府还大力削减公共开支，限制货币发行量，从而在控制高通货膨胀方面收到了初步效果。月通货膨胀率已从1988年12月的百分之一百二十六下降到1989年5月的百分之十五点五。咖啡、肉类和海产品的出口比去年也有所增长。
    近年来，尼加拉瓜政府在实现全国和解、推进国内的民主进程方面采取了一系列实际步骤。如同反政府武装进行直接谈判、同反对党举行对话、取消新闻检查、释放索摩查政权时期的军政人员、修改选举法，宣布提前大选等。这使尼加拉瓜的国际形象得到进一步改善。但是，由于美国一心要推翻尼现政权，一再阻挠有关中美洲和平协议的认真落实，尼加拉瓜人民在捍卫主权、建设国家的道路上还要经受严峻的考验。
