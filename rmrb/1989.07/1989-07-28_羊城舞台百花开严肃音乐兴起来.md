New China News Agency, Guangzhou, July 28th.

The musical stage in Guangzhou is beginning to change. The popularity of pop music has cooled down, and serious music, which has been neglected for many years, is becoming active again.

Since the beginning of summer, Guangzhou has successively held vocal music concerts, original song concerts, weekly music concerts, folk song concerts, symphony concerts, folk music salons, and film and television song concerts, attracting audiences from various levels.

In the past two years, the cultural stage in Guangzhou has been almost entirely dominated by pop music, with Hong Kong and Taiwan popular songs becoming the main content of music concerts. The ticket prices for star concerts have reached tens of yuan per ticket, and music venues have become places frequented only by the wealthy.

It is gratifying to see that recently, various forms of serious music concerts organized by some musicians, mass organizations, and enterprises have set a good example for the normalization of Guangzhou's cultural stage. The cultural department of Guangdong Province is preparing to hold more than ten performances with the theme of praising the motherland during the "August 1st" Army Day and National Day, supporting serious music, and making the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom" in the cultural field take root in Guangzhou.

    羊城舞台百花开严肃音乐兴起来
    新华社广州7月28日电　（记者王传真）羊城音乐舞台开始发生变化。流行音乐热已经降温，多年来一直受冷落的严肃音乐又活跃起来了。
    入夏以来，广州先后举办了美声唱法独唱音乐会、创作歌曲音乐会、星期音乐会、民族唱法独唱音乐会、交响音乐会、民族音乐沙龙、影视歌曲音乐会等，吸引了多层次的观众。
  近两年，广州的文艺舞台几乎被流行音乐占领，港台通俗歌曲成了音乐会的主要内容。歌星演唱会的票价高达几十元一张，音乐场所成了少数有钱人光顾的地方。
    令人可喜的是，最近由部分音乐家、群众团体、企业主办的多种形式的严肃音乐会为广州文艺舞台正常化开了好头。广东省文化部门正准备在“八一”建军节和国庆节期间，举办十几台以歌颂祖国为主题的文艺演出，扶持严肃音乐，使文艺“百花齐放”的方针在羊城找到落脚点。
