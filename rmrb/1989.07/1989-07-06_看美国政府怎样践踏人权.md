Editor's Note: After our newspaper published the article "How the U.S. Government Suppresses Protesting Crowds" on June 28, it received a strong social response. Today, we publish another article by Lü Qichang titled "How the U.S. Government Tramples on Human Rights."

In the 1960s and 1970s, the U.S. saw a series of movements: black people fighting against racial discrimination and advocating for equal rights, various social classes opposing the Vietnam War, and young students advocating for freedom and democracy on campuses. However, successive U.S. governments took severe measures to suppress these movements, which are clearly documented in U.S. publications and cannot be denied.

Recently, the U.S. government has mobilized all its propaganda machines. On one hand, it has spread rumors, slandered, and viciously attacked our country's just struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riots; on the other hand, it has advocated for a few counter-revolutionary rioters, portraying itself as the "savior of human rights." This is a typical trick used by the U.S. government to cry "thief" while stealing.

The Birmingham Incident: Kennedy Orders Suppression

From May 2 to 7, 1963, black people in Birmingham held consecutive protests against racial segregation. The police used batons, police dogs, high-pressure water hoses, and tear gas to suppress the protests, arresting over 3,000 people.

On May 8, the Alabama state government sent mounted police equipped with tear gas, light machine guns, and carbines to the city for patrols. The city government arrested Martin Luther King Jr. and more than 20 other black leaders on the grounds of organizing unauthorized protests. They were later sentenced to 180 days in prison and fined $100 each.

At the same time, President Kennedy instructed the Secretary of Defense to put "armed forces trained to control riots" on alert and sent 2,000 federal troops to the outskirts of Birmingham to stand by. He also allowed racist elements to shoot and kill the black leader Medgar Evers. During the funeral procession for Evers, attended by 5,000 black people, 400 National Guardsmen, under the command of the mayor, attacked the crowd, arresting 74 people and injuring hundreds.

Dark Days in the Black Neighborhood: Armed Police Sweep Repeatedly

Harlem is a famous black slum in New York. On July 16, 1964, police shot and killed a 15-year-old black boy without cause, sparking outrage among black residents. Thousands of black youths took to the streets and fought with the police for six days and nights. The police opened fire, killing three blacks and injuring over 100, with 108 arrested.

On August 11 of the same year, police in the Watts black neighborhood of Los Angeles arrested the Frye brothers and six other black youths, sparking public outrage. Seven thousand blacks took to the streets in protest. The city police immediately dispatched helicopters and 10,000 National Guardsmen to "restore law and order." On August 15, the federal government deployed an infantry division, bringing the number of military and police suppressing blacks to over 20,000. They surrounded the entire Watts area with bayonets, rifles, machine guns, tear gas, tanks, and helicopters, and sent 300 armed police to repeatedly sweep through the black neighborhood. From August 17 to 20, 15,000 military and police set up roadblocks and mounted machine guns, continuing to search for and kill blacks. In 11 days, 28 blacks were killed, 1,032 were injured, and 4,270 were arrested.

For the Right to Vote: Blood Flows

In January 1965, in the small town of Selma, Alabama, black leader Martin Luther King Jr. encouraged a struggle for voting rights. On January 19, blacks in groups of three or five went to the voter registration office but were suppressed by the police. In less than a month, over 3,500 blacks were arrested. To support the black struggle in Selma, blacks in Montgomery and Marion County also launched a struggle for equal rights. On February 28, mounted police in Marion shot and killed a black carpenter, James Jackson, during a protest. On March 3, blacks held a funeral for Jackson and decided to march in protest, but the local government banned it on the grounds of "endangering public safety."

On March 7, 600 blacks, despite the ban, began the first march from Selma to Montgomery. As soon as the marchers left the suburbs, they were surrounded by police. Mounted police charged into the crowd, injuring over 100 people.

On March 9, 4,000 blacks held a second march, which was also dispersed by the police.

From March 21 to 25, over 30,000 blacks and whites, with the support and encouragement of blacks nationwide, held a third march. The Johnson administration sent 1,800 federal troops, 1,000 marshals, and plainclothes agents to suppress the march. The U.S. Department of Defense set up "hotlines" in Montgomery and Selma to directly mobilize and command the National Guard of various states to assist local police in suppression activities. Meanwhile, the 2nd Infantry Division stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia, was also on alert.

Police Brutality in Detroit: Government Sends Paratroopers to Suppress

On the morning of July 23, 1967, police in a black bar in Detroit's black neighborhood wielded batons, beating and arbitrarily arresting black customers. Black workers rose up in resistance, and a large-scale anti-violence struggle quickly spread to the city center.

On July 24, President Johnson authorized the Secretary of Defense to "take all necessary measures" to restore "law and order," ordering 5,000 federal paratroopers to enter Detroit, bringing the number of military and police participating in the suppression to over 20,000. They used various weapons to suppress the struggle. According to official U.S. statistics, 43 people died, 2,000 were injured, and 7,200 were arrested, including the newly appointed chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

In 1967, 128 cities in the U.S. saw 105 large-scale black anti-violence struggles.

To deal with the rising black movement, in the late summer of 1967, President Johnson first established the "National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders" under the President's control within the federal government. Its tasks included investigating and reporting the causes and impacts of domestic "riots," identifying organizations and individuals involved in inciting and promoting violence, and formulating methods and strategies to prevent and control domestic "riots."

Soon after, Johnson established another "National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence" directly under the President's leadership.

The Department of Defense also established a "Bureau of Civil Disorders and Emergency Planning" to collect intelligence on anti-violence struggles and deploy forces to suppress violence in various places.

The federal government established many "Federal Military Training Schools" to specifically train armed personnel for suppressing anti-violence struggles.

The Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

On March 28, 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. went to Memphis, Tennessee, leading 6,000 blacks in a protest march demanding increased wages for local sanitation workers and recognition of their union. The city government sent police to attack the blacks, and the governor dispatched over 4,000 National Guardsmen to participate in the suppression, ordering another 8,000 National Guardsmen to stand by. Under military and police suppression, hundreds of blacks were injured and arrested, and one was killed. On April 4 in the afternoon, Martin Luther King Jr. was shot on the balcony of a hotel in the city, immediately sparking large-scale anti-violence struggles among blacks. In the following month, 172 cities across the U.S. saw 202 black anti-violence struggles. On April 3, President Johnson declared that Washington was in a state of "chaos," authorizing the Secretary of Defense to deploy regular troops for suppression "if necessary." After mobilizing the 83rd Airborne Division on April 6, he sent 40,000 federal troops on April 7 to enter the most intense struggle areas of Washington, Chicago, and Baltimore to suppress the struggles. Washington immediately imposed a curfew, with 13,600 federal troops sealing off the city's black neighborhood. On April 10, the number of federal troops involved in suppressing blacks increased to over 60,000, with another 20,000 on standby.

According to the U.S. Department of Justice, in 13 days, 46 people were killed, 2,561 were injured, and 21,271 were arrested in 76 cities.

In the same year, Johnson issued two pieces of legislation: one was the "Civil Rights Act," which stipulated that "anyone who uses the postal service, telephone, telegraph, radio, or telegraph to incite riots; or organizes, promotes, encourages, participates in, or engages in riots; or takes any violent action to promote riots; or aids or incites anyone to incite or participate in riots; or takes any action to promote riots" would be fined up to $10,000 or imprisoned for up to five years, or both. The other was the "Public Transportation Safety and Street Safety Act," aimed at assisting local authorities in training and equipping police and National Guards, and enhancing the effectiveness of local courts, prisons, and military police in "controlling riots."

    看美国政府怎样践踏人权
    吕其昌
    编者按：本报6月28日刊出《看美国政府怎样镇压示威群众》一文后，社会反应强烈。今再刊出吕其昌同志寄来的《看美国政府怎样践踏人权》一文。
    在60年代、70年代，美国黑人反对种族歧视、争取平等权利的民权运动，各阶层人民反对侵越战争的运动，以及青年学生争取自由、民主的校园运动此伏彼起，如火如荼。然而美国历届政府对这些运动采取了严厉的镇压措施，这是美国书刊白纸黑字写在那里，不容否认的。
    近来，美国政府开动了一切宣传机器，一方面对我国平息反革命暴乱的正义斗争大肆造谣、诬蔑和恶毒攻击；另一方面又为极少数反革命暴徒鸣冤叫屈，把自己装扮成“维护人权”的救世主。这是美国政府玩弄贼喊捉“贼”的惯用伎俩。
    伯明翰事件　肯尼迪总统下令镇压
    1963年5月2日至7日，伯明翰市的黑人接连举行反对种族隔离的示威游行，警察用木棒、警犬、高压水龙、催泪弹进行镇压，先后有3000多人被捕。
    8日，华盛顿州政府向该市派出配有催泪瓦斯、轻机枪和卡宾枪的骑警警戒；市政府当局并以组织示威游行未经许可为由，逮捕了马丁·路德·金等20多名黑人领袖。后来，他们分别被判处180天监禁和100美元罚金。
    与此同时，肯尼迪总统指示国防部长命令“受过控制骚乱训练的武装部队”处于戒备状态，并派遣2000名联邦军前往伯明翰市郊待命，还纵容种族主义分子枪杀了黑人领袖梅加·埃弗斯。在5000名黑人举行的埃弗斯葬礼的示威中，400名国民警卫队，在市长指挥下大打出手，74人被捕，数百人受伤。
    黑人区暗无天日　武装警察反复扫荡
    哈莱姆是美国著名的黑人贫民窟，位于纽约。1964年7月16日，警察在这里无故枪杀1名15岁黑人少年，激起黑人群众的极大义愤。数千名黑人青年走上街头，同警察进行了6昼夜的搏斗，警察开枪镇压，3名黑人被枪杀，100多人受重伤，108人被捕。
    同年8月11日，警察在洛杉矶市瓦茨黑人区，逮捕弗赖伊兄弟等7名黑人青年，激起黑人公愤。7000名黑人涌上街头示威游行，市警察立即派出直升机，1万名国民警卫队员出动，以“恢复法律和秩序”。15日，联邦政府又调一个步兵师，使镇压黑人的军警达到2万多人。他们用刺刀、步枪、机枪、催泪弹、坦克和直升机包围整个瓦茨区，并派300名武装警察反复在黑人区进行“扫荡”。17日到20日，1.5万名军警设路障、架机枪，继续搜捕和屠杀黑人。在11天中，有28名黑人被杀害，有1032人被打伤，4270人被逮捕。
    为享选举权　鲜血满地流
    1965年1月亚拉巴马州小城塞尔马在黑人领袖马丁·路德·金的鼓励下，开展了争取选举权的斗争。1月19日，该市黑人三五成群地前往选民登记处，但遭警察镇压。不到一个月，被捕黑人达3500人之多。为了声援塞尔马的黑人斗争，该州的蒙哥马利市和马里昂县的黑人，也展开了争取平等权利的斗争。2月28日，骑警在马里昂枪杀了示威的黑人木工杰米·杰克逊，3月3日，黑人为杰克逊举行葬礼，并决定举行抗议进军，但地方政府以“危害公共治安”为名下令禁止。
    3月7日，600名黑人不顾当局禁令，开始了从塞尔马到蒙哥马利的第一次进军。队伍刚出郊区，就被警察包围起来，骑警冲入人群，当场被打伤被踩伤者达100余人，示威黑人被驱散。
    9日，4000名黑人举行第二次进军，队伍又被警察驱散。
    21日至25日，3万多名黑人和白人在全国黑人支持和鼓励下，举行第三次进军。约翰逊政府派出1800名联邦军、1000名宪兵和便衣特务，前去镇压。美国国防部在蒙哥马利和塞尔马设置了“热线电话”，直接动员并指挥各州的国民警卫队配合地方警察进行镇压活动，同时，驻在佐治亚州本宁堡的步兵第二师也处于“戒备状态”。
    底特律酒馆警察逞凶引起风暴政府派空降部队镇压
    1967年7月23日晨，警察在底特律城黑人区一家黑人酒馆挥舞警棍，肆意殴打和滥捕黑人顾客，黑人工人群起反抗，一场大规模的抗暴斗争迅速扩展到市中心区。
    24日，约翰逊总统宣布授权国防部长“采取一切必要措施”，恢复“法律和秩序”，命令联邦空降部队5000人进驻底特律，使参加镇压的军警达2万多人。他们动用了各种武器进行镇压。据美国官方发表的统计数字，在这次斗争中，有43人死亡，2000人受伤。7200人被捕，其中包括新任的学生非暴力协调委员会主席。
    1967年，美国有128个城市爆发了105起较大规模的黑人抗暴斗争。
    为了对付日益高涨的黑人运动，1957年夏末，约翰逊总统先在联邦政府内建立了总统控制下的“民众骚乱全国咨询委员会”，任务是调查和报告国内“骚乱”的起因和影响，以及“从事煽动和鼓动暴力的组织和个人”；制定避免和控制国内“骚乱”的方法和策略等。
    此后不久，约翰逊又设立了一个直属总统领导的“研究暴力起因和制止办法的全国委员会”。
    国防部也建立了一个“民众骚乱和统筹管理局”，专门收集有关抗暴斗争的情报，负责部署镇压各地暴力斗争的兵力。
    联邦政府建立了许多“联邦军事训练学校”，专门训练镇压抗暴斗争的武装人员。
    马丁·路德·金被害事件
    1968年3月28日，马丁·路德·金到田纳西州孟菲斯城，率领6000名黑人示威游行，要求增加当地清洁工人工资并承认他们组织的工会。市政当局出动警察袭击黑人，州长也派出4000多名国民警卫队参加镇压，并命令另外8000名国民警卫队处于戒备状态。在军警镇压下，数百名黑人被打伤和逮捕，一人被杀害。4月4日下午，马丁·路德·金在该地一家旅馆的阳台上被刺，立即引起黑人大规模的抗暴斗争。其后的一个月内，全美172个城市爆发了202起黑人抗暴斗争，4月3日，约翰逊总统就宣布华盛顿陷入“混乱状态”，授权国防部长在“必要时出动正规部队进行镇压”。继6日调动第83空降师后，7日又派遣4万名联邦军，分别开进斗争最激烈的华盛顿、芝加哥和巴尔的摩等地镇压。华盛顿即日实行宵禁，1.36万联邦军封锁了该市黑人区。10日，投入镇压黑人的联邦军增至6万多人，另有2万名整装待命。
    据美国司法部统计，76个城市在13天中，有46人被打死，2561人受伤，21271人被捕。
    同年，约翰逊颁布两项立法：一是《民权法案》，规定“凡是使用邮政、电话、电报、无线电或电报，企图煽动暴乱；或组织、促使、鼓励、参加、或进行暴乱；或在促进暴乱中，采取任何暴力行动；或帮助或教唆任何人去煽动或参加；或采取任何行动以促进暴乱者”，均要罚款1万美元以下或监禁5年以下，或二者并用。另一项是《控制公共汽车犯罪和街道安全法》，目的是援助地方当局训练和装备警察、国民警卫队，提高地方法院、监狱和军警“控制骚乱”的效力。
