The flood peaks of the Yangtze River and Han River have just passed, but severe drought is now threatening Hubei Province. It was learned at a meeting held by the provincial Party committee and government that by July 21, the drought-affected area in the province had reached 6.84 million mu (approximately 456,000 hectares).

Meteorological departments reported that since mid-July, although there have been significant flood peaks passing through the Hubei section of the Yangtze River, most areas in the province have experienced high temperatures and little rain. Temperatures of 37-39 degrees Celsius have persisted for more than ten days. The intense heat and high evaporation rates have led to droughts in major grain-producing areas such as Jingzhou, Huanggang, and Xiaogan.

    湖北洪峰刚过伏旱又至
    新华社武汉7月24日电  （记者陈新洲）长江、汉江洪峰刚刚过去，严重的伏旱又在威胁湖北省。记者日前在省委、省政府召开的会议上获悉，到7月21日全省受旱面积达684万亩。
    气象部门反映，7月中旬以来，长江湖北江段虽然有较大的洪峰过境，但本省大部分地区高温少雨，37—39摄氏度的高温天气已持续十几天，烈日高温，蒸发量很大，荆州、黄冈、孝感主要产粮区都遭到旱灾袭击。
