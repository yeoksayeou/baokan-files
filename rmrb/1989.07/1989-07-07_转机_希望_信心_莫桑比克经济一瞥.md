	Turning Point, Hope, and Confidence
	– A Glimpse of Mozambique's Economy
	By Shen Minghe, People's Daily

	“Prolonged civil war and instability have pushed Mozambique to the brink of hunger and collapse. Mozambique is sinking in the water...” This is how a Western reporter described Mozambique.

	“Our country has seen a turning point, the economy has hope, and the people have confidence!” This is the voice of a local friend we met during our visit to Mozambique.

	Mozambique is originally a beautiful and rich country. However, after independence, due to military invasions and armed threats from South Africa, as well as the support it provided to anti-government armed groups, coupled with policy mistakes and natural disasters such as droughts, floods, and locusts, the country has been in turmoil for a long time, with economic crises and difficult living conditions for the people. According to an official from the News Department, especially by the end of 1986, when Chissano took the oath of office as President, the economy was on the verge of collapse. The Mozambican Minister of Finance, who received us, made a comparison with specific figures. He said that in 1986, agricultural production had decreased by 50% compared to before independence, and industrial production had decreased by 75%; external debt was as high as $3.2 billion, with a per capita debt of $230; the grain self-sufficiency rate was only 8%. According to statistics, at that time, 1.8 million people were starving, and even the residents of Maputo had only 3-4 kilograms of grain per person per month. Prices soared, and the price of a chicken was equivalent to a worker's monthly salary.

	Facing this urgent and severe situation, President Chissano first called on the military and civilians to counterattack the anti-government armed groups. However, he also pointed out that the fundamental guarantee of political stability is economic development and the improvement of people's lives. He started from reality and proposed the 1987-1990 "Economic Revival Plan" with agriculture as the center. In agriculture, the government amended the land law formulated at the beginning of independence, changing the lease period of land by farmers or individuals from 15 years to 50 years; established the Agricultural Development Foundation; rectified and disbanded poorly managed state-owned farms, distributing the land to farmers, and currently 70 state-owned farms have been converted to private operations; the purchase price of agricultural and sideline products has been increased by 200-400%. In industry and commerce, the government advocates the initiative of private enterprises, and state-owned enterprises gradually implement self-sufficiency; the domestic market is opened, and import and export restrictions are relaxed. To further revitalize the economy, the government made another price reform in 1988. Except for 27 items (grains, cotton, oil, electrical appliances, tires, and fertilizers) that are priced by the government, the rest are adjusted by the market. In addition, economic cooperation with Western countries and international organizations has been strengthened, and foreign aid has been sought.

	Under the leadership of President Chissano over the past two years, the nation has made arduous efforts. Finally, Mozambique's economy has begun to recover from the turning point. We deeply felt this during our visits to various parts of the country. Upon entering the Maputo Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory, a prominent slogan appeared before us: "We will turn the 80s and 90s into decades of overcoming underdevelopment." The manager of the factory's operations department, Mr. Fernando Paulo, told us, "Due to the resolute implementation of the 'Economic Revival Plan,' the factory earned $500,000 in foreign exchange for the country in 1988, and this year we aim to reach $1 million."

	During a visit to a farmer in the Green Zone (agricultural area), the host, Fernando, told us: "Due to the correct policies, we have more enthusiasm, and in 1988, we sold all the grain and vegetables to the state. We used the money to buy a tractor and field irrigation equipment."

	Our interviews confirmed what the Minister of Finance said: "Our industry and agriculture have become active, and the economy has hope." He told us: "The national GDP grew by 4% in 1988, industry grew by 18%, agricultural products purchased by the state increased by 27%, exports increased by 8.5%, imports increased by 18%, and market supply increased by 5%."

	The situation in Maputo proves that economic reform has brought about a turning point for society and brought joy to the people. It is said that a few years ago, the capital's vegetable market only had cabbage leaves, and the store shelves were empty. Now, stores have everything from ordinary clothes to high-end fashion, from needles and soap to imported perfumes. The Maputo Central Market has all kinds of fresh vegetables and fish, shrimp, and crab meat, and the crowd of buyers is endless.

	Although Mozambique's economy has seen a turning point and has hope, the people have confidence, but there are still many difficulties. Mozambique's economy has gone through a tortuous development process, from "desperate and seeing no way out" to "dark willows and bright flowers in a new village," it has walked a path of developing its national economy. As long as the political situation continues to stabilize and the policies are correct, its economy will gradually revive, and its economic potential will be increasingly realized. The future is bright.

### 转机·希望·信心——莫桑比克经济一瞥

    转机·希望·信心
    ——莫桑比克经济一瞥
    本报记者　申明河
    “内战连绵，动荡不安，把莫桑比克推向饥饿和崩溃的边缘。莫桑比克正在水中下沉……”这是西方某记者笔下对莫桑比克的描述。
    “我们的国家出现了转机，经济有了希望，人民有了信心！”这是我们在莫桑比克访问期间当地一位朋友的声音。
    莫桑比克本是美丽富饶的国家。但在独立后，由于南非的军事入侵和武装威胁，以及它所支持的反政府武装的破坏，加之政策上的失误，又遭受旱、涝、蝗虫等自然灾害，致使这个国家长时间处于动乱之中，经济危机四起，人民生活相当困难。据新闻部一位官员介绍，尤其在1986年底，当希萨诺宣誓就任总统时，经济已濒于崩溃。接见我们的莫桑比克财政部长用具体数字作了对比。他说，1986年农业生产比独立前下降了50％，工业下降了75％；外债高达32亿美元，人均负债230美元；粮食自给率只有8％。据统计，当时全国有180万人挨饿，就连马普托居民，每人每月也只有3—4公斤粮食，物价飞涨，一只鸡的价钱竟相当于一个工人的月工资。
    面对这种危急、严峻的形势，希萨诺总统首先号召军民对反政府武装进行反击。但他同时指出，稳定政局的根本保证是发展经济，改善人民生活。他从实际出发，提出了以发展农业为中心的1987—1990年的“经济复兴计划”。在农业方面，政府修改了独立之初制定的土地法，将农民或私人租用土地期限由15年改为50年；建立了农业发展基金会；整顿和解散了经营不善的国营农场，把土地分给农民，目前已有70个国营农场改为私人经营；农副产品的收购价格提高了200—400％。在工商业方面，政府提倡发挥私人企业的积极性，国营企业逐步实行自负盈亏；放开国内市场，放宽进出口限制。为进一步搞活经济，政府在1988年对价格又作了一次改革，除27种商品（粮、棉、油、电器、轮胎和化肥等）由政府定价外，其余均由市场调节。此外，增进了同西方国家和国际组织的经济合作，争取外援。
    希萨诺总统执政两年来，引导全民作出艰苦努力。终于使莫桑比克经济由转机开始复苏。我们在这个国家各地采访时深深感到这一点。一进入马普托机车车辆厂，醒目的标语口号呈现在我们面前：“我们要把80—90年代变成战胜不发达的年代。”工厂经营部经理费尔南德·保罗先生告诉我们“由于坚决执行了‘经济复兴计划’，工厂1988年给国家创汇50万美元，今年争取达到100万美元”。
    在参观绿色区（农业区）的一个农户时，主人费尔南德告诉我们：由于政策对头，他们干劲大了，1988年把所有粮食和蔬菜全部卖给国家。把得到的钱购买了拖拉机和田间喷灌设备。
    我们采访的情况印证了财政部长所说的一段话：“我们的工农业活跃起来了，经济有希望了。”他告诉我们：“1988年的国民生产总值增长了4％，工业增长18％，国家收购的农产品增长27％，出口增长8.5％，进口增长18％，市场供应增长5％。”
    马普托的景象证明了经济改革已给社会带来了转机，给人民带来了欣慰。据说，前几年，首都菜市场只有牛皮菜叶，商店货架空空。现在，商店里从普通衣服到高级时装，从针线肥皂等商品到进口香水都有。马普托中央菜市场各种新鲜蔬菜和鱼、虾、蟹肉等应有尽有，购买的人群川流不息。
    莫桑比克的经济虽然出现了转机，有了希望，人民对此有了信心，但目前还存在不少困难。莫桑比克经济经历了曲折的发展过程，从“山穷水尽疑无路”到“柳暗花明又一村”，走出了一条发展民族经济的道路。只要政局日益稳定，政策对头，其经济将会逐步复兴，经济潜力也会日益得到发挥，前景是光明的。
