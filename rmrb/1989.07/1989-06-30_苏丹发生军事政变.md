Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, June 30th.

Sudan's military forces staged a coup earlier today, overthrowing the civilian government led by Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and seizing power.

Lieutenant General Omar al-Bashir, the deputy chief of staff of the Sudanese armed forces, subsequently issued a statement on the radio, declaring that the coup forces had taken control of the government. Based on this, local sources speculate that Omar al-Bashir may be the leader of this coup.

At present, the fate of Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and who will replace him in his future position remains unclear.
