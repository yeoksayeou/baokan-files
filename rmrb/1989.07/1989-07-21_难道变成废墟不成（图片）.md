Title: Is It to Become a Ruin?

Edition: 6

The barracks have had their roofs torn off, and the rafters and purlins have been dismantled (see pictures one and two). The walls have been pushed over, and the doors and windows have been stripped bare (see picture three). The trees have been felled, leaving the camp in a desolate state (see picture four). A well-maintained military camp covering an area of 20,000 square meters has been ruined beyond recognition by some people from Xiguan, Shangqiu County, through both overt and covert means. According to incomplete statistics, by the beginning of May this year, 647 doors, 1,034 windows, 453 door and window frames, and 618 pieces of electrical equipment had been stolen from the barracks. Additionally, 1,011 square meters of walls, 2,946 square meters of ceilings, and 500 square meters of pigsties had been dismantled, and 790 trees had been cut down. Currently, the barracks are still in dire straits. If effective measures are not taken promptly to stop the blatant theft and looting, it will not be long before this military camp is reduced to a pile of ruins.

    难道变成废墟不成
    营房掀了顶、椽、檩被拆走了（图一、二）；墙身推倒了，门窗被拆得一个不留（图三）；大树锯倒了，营地里留下一片荒凉（图四）。好端端的一座占地两万平方米的军营，就这样被商丘县西关的一些人明里暗里糟塌得不成样子。据不完全统计，截至今年五月上旬，这座营房已被盗走门六百四十七扇，窗一千零三十四扇，门窗框架四百五十三个，供电设备六百一十八件；被拆墙体一千零一十一平方米，房屋天棚二千九百四十六平方米，猪圈五百平方米；被砍树木七百九十多棵。目前，这座军营仍处在厄难之中，如不及时采取有效措施，制止一些人的明抢暗偷，用不了多久，这座军营将留下一堆废墟。		河南商丘驻军      高连春
