Yishan County Shortens Primary School Curriculum by One Year

Our county is one of the poorest in the nation, with a relatively backward economy and culture. At the end of last year, the county's education department changed the six-year primary school system to a five-year system, causing fourth and fifth-grade students to graduate a year early. Currently, the order of primary school teaching is in chaos. Many schools' teachers are working overtime to cram in extra lessons, and students in the county seat barely have any Sundays off. Teachers are under great pressure, students have heavy burdens, and the young students find this teaching method hard to accept. Their dislike for school is growing, and their learning effectiveness is poor. Parents and teachers are very dissatisfied with this. It is said that shortening the curriculum by one year is to save on educational expenses. At a time when the central government emphasizes the importance of education, I wonder if this approach aligns with the central government's spirit!

    宜山县缩短小学学制一年
    我县是全国贫困县之一，经济、文化较落后。去年底，县教育部门把小学六年制改为五年制，在校的四五年级学生均要提前一年毕业。目前，小学教学秩序出现混乱。不少学校的老师加班加点突击补课，县城内的小学生基本上没有星期天了。教师压力大，学生负担重，小学生们对这种教学方式很难接受，厌学情绪越来越严重，学习效果很差。学生家长、教师对此十分不满。据说缩短一年学制是为了节省教育经费。在中央强调重视教育的今天，不知这种做法是否符合中央精神！
