The Guangxi Fangchenggang District Oil Company applied for foreign exchange to import oil last October. Later, they learned from the Fangchenggang District Foreign Exchange Management Bureau that the Fangchenggang District Foreign Ship Supply Company had 700,000 US dollars. The Oil Company then engaged in various activities to sign a joint operation agreement for oil with the Foreign Ship Supply Company, thereby obtaining 400,000 US dollars. However, these 400,000 US dollars were not used for oil operations but were instead sold by the relevant personnel, earning an illegal profit of 460,000 yuan.

It is suggested that the relevant departments seriously investigate this case and severely punish the responsible parties.

    申请外汇进石油  暗中活动倒美元
    广西防城港区石油分公司于去年10月以进口石油为由，申请调剂外汇。后来，他们通过港区外汇管理局了解到防城港区外轮供应公司有70万美元，石油分公司便多方活动，与外轮供应公司以签订联合经营石油的协议，换取了40万美元。然而，这40万美元根本没有用于经营石油，而是有关人员将它倒卖了，从中牟取暴利46万元人民币。
    建议有关部门认真追查此案，严肃处理有关责任者。
