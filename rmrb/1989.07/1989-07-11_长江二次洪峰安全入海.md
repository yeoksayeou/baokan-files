Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, July 11th

The second flood peak of the Yangtze River has safely passed through Jiangsu and entered the sea. This was reported today by the Jiangsu Provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief Command.

According to reports, at 8 AM today, the flow rate measured at the last hydrological station in Anhui, Dàtōng, was 56,400 cubic meters per second. The inflow into the Jiangsu section of the Yangtze River has decreased by 3,600 cubic meters per second compared to a few days ago. By 4:40 PM, the high tide level in the Nanjing Xiakou area had dropped from 9.02 meters on July 9th to 8.69 meters.

Due to the influence of ocean tides on the water levels in the Jiangsu section of the Yangtze River, it is difficult to clearly determine the passage of the flood peak. According to the flood control department's analysis, the second flood peak passed through Jiangsu around July 10th and did not cause any harm.

    长江二次洪峰安全入海
    据新华社南京7月11日电　（记者孙参）记者今天从江苏省防汛防旱指挥部获悉，长江第二次洪峰已经安全通过江苏入海。
    据悉，今天上午8点，长江下游最后一个水文站安徽大通水文站测到的流量为5.64万立方米每秒，长江江苏段来水比几天前减少3600立方米每秒，下午4点40分，南京下关一带长江高潮水位也由本月9号的9.02米降至8.69米。
    由于长江江苏段潮位受海洋潮汐影响，洪峰经过时无法明确判断，据防汛部门分析，第二次洪峰是在10号左右通过江苏的，洪峰通过时没有造成危害。
