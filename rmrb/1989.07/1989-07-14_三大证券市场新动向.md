The stock market crash that swept through the Western world in 1987 severely impacted the New York, London, and Tokyo securities markets, plunging them into a period of stagnation. In recent years, with the gradual improvement of the economies in various countries, these three major securities markets have shown different degrees of recovery and development.

The Tokyo securities market has developed rapidly. In 1988, the total market value of listed securities in the Tokyo market reached 50 trillion yen, with an annual securities trading volume of 40 trillion yen, surpassing both the London and New York markets and ranking first in the world.

The main reasons for the rapid development of the Japanese securities market are:

1. The appreciation of the yen has led to a decrease in the prices of imported raw materials in Japan, thereby significantly reducing inventory values without changing inventory quantities.
2. The demand for equipment investment by Japanese companies has weakened, leading to a large amount of funds flowing into the financial market for securities investment. Currently, the financial assets of Japanese companies increase by an average of over 4 trillion yen each year, thereby rapidly expanding the scale of the securities market.
3. The personal savings rate in Japan remains at a high level of 15%, resulting in an annual increase of 6 trillion yen in personal financial assets.

It is estimated that in the next few years, the rapid expansion of the Japanese securities market will continue.

The New York securities market has begun to recover. As the epicenter of the 1987 stock market crash, the New York market was the hardest hit. However, since the beginning of this year, the New York securities market has shown signs of recovery.

Observations over the past nine years indicate that if the stock market rises by more than 5% in January, the average annual stock market increase is 23.1%. Since the New York market's stock prices rose by 7.1% in January 1989, it is expected that the New York securities market will see a significant increase in stock prices this year.

The recovery of the New York securities market is related to a series of political and economic changes in the United States.

1. Politically, the easing of U.S.-Soviet relations has allowed the U.S. to reduce its fiscal deficit through arms reduction, enabling a large amount of capital, technology, and talent from the military industry to flow into civilian enterprises, thereby enhancing the vitality and international competitiveness of these enterprises.
2. Economically, the U.S. fiscal deficit has decreased from 6% last year to 3% this year, leading to stable economic growth.
3. In the context of a depreciating dollar, the U.S. manufacturing industry has shown signs of development.

In the past, many U.S. investment institutions diversified their risks by investing part of their capital in Japan. However, this year, these institutions have changed their strategy, concentrating all their funds in the U.S. securities market. All these factors have helped the U.S. securities market emerge from its low point and begin to recover and develop.

The London securities market has emerged from its slump. Since the stock market crash, the London securities market has been in a state of stagnation. However, since January 1989, there have been clear signs of recovery. The reasons for the rise in stock prices in the London securities market are:

Firstly, before this year, investors from other Western European countries, fearing inflation and currency devaluation, concentrated their funds in the London financial market. Additionally, influenced by the New York securities market, the stock prices of some large U.S. companies in the London market have risen, leading to an increase in stock prices in the London securities market.

Secondly, experts predict that British corporate profits will grow by double digits this year. At the same time, with the expectation of a decrease in domestic interest rates, domestic funds will also flow into the securities market.

Since the United Kingdom will take measures this year to control inflation, reduce the trade deficit, and lower bank interest rates, it is expected that the London securities market will recover this year.

    三大证券市场新动向
    唱新
    1987年席卷西方世界的股票暴跌风潮，曾使纽约、伦敦、东京三大证券市场受到严重打击，一度陷入萧条之中。近年来，在各国经济有所好转的带动下，三大证券市场逐渐得到不同程度的恢复和发展。
    东京证券市场发展迅速　东京证券市场是第一个恢复并发展起来的。1988年，东京证券市场的登记证券的时价总额达500万亿日元，年证券交易额达400万亿日元，超过了伦敦和纽约市场，居世界第一位。
    日本证券市场如此迅速发展的主要原因是：
    1、日元升值使日本进口原材料价格下降，这样，在库存量不变的情况下，库存额却大幅度下降。
    2、日本企业对设备投资的需求减弱，大量资金转向金融市场，进行证券投资。当前，日本企业金融资产额平均每年增加40万亿日元以上，因此使证券市场的规模迅速扩大。
    3、日本国内个人储蓄率仍保持在15％这一高水平上，使每年个人金融资产的增加额达60万亿日元。
    据估计，在今后几年内，日本证券市场这种迅速扩大的势头不会改变。
    纽约证券市场开始复苏　纽约证券市场是1987年股票暴跌风潮的发源地，受到的冲击最大。今年以来，纽约证券市场开始复苏。
    从对过去9年的观察表明，1月份的股票行市上升率如果达到5％以上的话，当年的股票行市上升率平均为23.1％。由于1989年1月纽约市场的股票行市上升率达7.1％，因此，预计今年纽约证券市场的股票行市将出现较大幅度的上升。
    纽约证券市场的复苏，与美国国内政治和经济方面的一系列变化有关。
    1、在政治上，美苏关系趋向缓和，美国由于裁军减少了财政赤字，使军事工业中的大量资金、技术和人才转向民间企业，提高了企业的活力和国际竞争能力。
    2、在经济上，1989年美国的财政预算赤字由上年的6％下降到3％，使美国经济稳定增长。
    3、在美元贬值的情况下，美国制造业出现了发展的势头。
    过去，美国许多投资机构为了分散风险，将一部分资本投向日本，但是，今年以来，这些投资机构改变了战略，将全部资金集中投入美国证券市场，所有这些都使美国证券市场走出低谷，并开始恢复和发展。
    伦敦证券市场走出低谷　伦敦证券市场自股票暴跌风潮以来，一直处于萧条状态。但是，从1989年1月份起出现了比较明显的回升势头。伦敦证券市场股票价格回升的原因是：
    首先，今年以前，由于西欧其它国家的投资家们担心通货膨胀加剧和货币贬值，把资金集中投入伦敦金融市场。此外，由于受纽约证券市场的影响，美国一些大企业在伦敦市场上的股票价格上升，造成伦敦证券市场股票价格的上升。
    其次，专家预测，今年英国企业利润将出现两位数增长，同时，由于人们预测国内利率将下跌，从而使国内资金也流向证券市场。
    由于英国在今年将采取措施控制通货膨胀、减少贸易收支赤字、降低银行利率，因此，预计在今年内伦敦证券市场将出现复苏。
