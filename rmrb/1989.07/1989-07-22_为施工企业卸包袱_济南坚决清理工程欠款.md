A large amount of overdue engineering payments has caused serious difficulties for construction enterprises. The Jinan municipal government has taken emergency measures to address the issue of clearing overdue payments.

As of now, Jinan has a total of 140 million yuan in overdue engineering payments, a 45% increase compared to the same period last year. The large amount of overdue payments has left many enterprises heavily in debt, unable to purchase building materials or pay wages. Approximately 30% of ongoing construction projects are in a state of frequent stoppages, placing a heavy burden on construction enterprises.

In response to this situation, the Jinan municipal government has required relevant departments to cooperate and work together to clear overdue engineering payments. For completed projects, if the construction unit has overdue payments, the planning department will not allocate new projects; for projects that have already been allocated, funds will first be used to repay the construction enterprises. If the construction unit lacks construction funds for repayment, the bank will transfer funds from other sources for repayment or use products, equipment, or real estate for repayment. If the construction unit has the ability to repay but cannot do so immediately, a plan should be made to repay in installments. For ongoing projects, if the construction unit causes overdue payments due to unsecured funds, the construction enterprise can stop work and withdraw, with the maintenance fees borne by the construction unit. Any unit that arbitrarily expands the construction scale or raises construction standards, causing overdue payments, will be responsible for repayment by the construction unit. For overdue payments caused by planning gaps or price increases, relevant departments should realistically supplement the plan and add funds.

    为施工企业卸包袱
    济南坚决清理工程欠款
    本报济南电　记者贾建舟报道：大量拖欠工程款，给施工企业造成了严重困难。济南市政府采取紧急措施，做好清欠工作。
    到目前为止，济南市共拖欠工程款1.4亿元，比去年同期上升45％。大量拖欠工程款，使得许多企业负债累累，无力购买建材和支付工资，约有30％的在建工程处于干干停停的状态，给施工企业造成了沉重的负担。
    针对上述情况，济南市政府要求各有关部门互相配合，共同做好清理拖欠工程款的工作。对已经竣工的项目，凡建设单位有拖欠款额的，计划部门不予安排新的项目；已经安排的，其资金先偿还给施工企业。建设单位无建设资金还款的，由银行从其他资金划拨还款或以产品、设备、房地产作价还款。建设单位有偿还能力而一时不能还清的，应做出计划分批还清。对在建项目，建设单位因资金不落实造成拖欠的，施工企业可停工撤出，其维护费由建设单位承担。凡擅自扩大建设规模、提高建设标准而造成拖欠的，由建设单位负责还款。因计划安排缺口、物价上涨因素造成拖欠的，有关部门应实事求是地追补计划和追加资金。
