Recently, relevant departments investigated the 100 millionaires that emerged in Youxian County four years ago. Now, these millionaires have all fallen silent, and some have even become impoverished. Why have these millionaires fallen?

Pursuing extravagance and blind consumption. Among these 100 millionaires, 78 households built new houses over the past four years, with some doing so just to show off. In Yinheng Township, there is a transportation specialist, Mr. Wu, whose family of four originally had five or six old rooms. In 1982, he added three new rooms. After making money from transportation, he found the original rooms unsophisticated and demolished them all, spending over 30,000 yuan to build a two-story house with a garage. Now, his residence is the most impressive in the area. However, the transportation industry has declined, his truck was sold, and his family's income is no longer what it used to be. Some millionaires spend extravagantly on weddings and funerals. For example, one person spent nearly 100,000 yuan on a funeral for their parents; another spent as much on a daughter's wedding as it would cost to build a new house. These farmers, with money in hand, did not use their surplus funds for expanding production but instead squandered it. Thus, long-distance traders lacked capital, and those running businesses lacked funds. Large-scale grain producers could not afford fertilizer or pesticides.

Receiving endless requests and taking without asking. Youxian County's agricultural specialist, Chen Putuan, is known as the "King of Silver Ear Mushrooms." After gaining fame, he received countless letters seeking advice, and visitors came in droves. According to Chen Putuan's records, from 1982 to 1985, over 3,000 people visited him, with nearly 2,000 staying overnight and 2,700 having meals. Chen Putuan was invited to share his silver ear mushroom cultivation techniques and wealth-creation experiences in 5 provinces and 67 counties, printing 5,000 copies of silver ear mushroom cultivation materials at his own expense to give to visitors. Over the past four years, he received almost daily requests for money, donations, and free services, until he became impoverished.

Overhyped propaganda, false reputation, and adverse effects. After the responsibility system was implemented in rural areas, farmer Chen Fuyuan became a duck-raising specialist. At this time, leaders visited him, government departments summarized his experiences, and journalists came for interviews, making him a model of wealth creation and one of Youxian County's 100 millionaires. In reality, Chen Fuyuan did not make much money from raising ducks. Relevant departments included him in the county's 100 millionaires, which was like forcing a duck to climb a tree. This duck, once on the tree, to maintain appearances, brought other people's rice mills and diesel engines into his home, resulting in imprisonment. Several other households, falsely promoted as wealthy, felt they could not stand firm in their hometowns and had to leave for other provinces, while others continued to live in poverty.

Although the 100 millionaires that emerged in Youxian County in 1984 have fallen, more farmers have taken the path of hard work and wealth creation. Currently, the county has over 5,600 new types of specialist households. The situation of Youxian County's farmers working hard to become wealthy is encouraging. However, we must not forget the fact that the 100 millionaires have fallen, so that farmers who have taken the path to wealth can steadily move forward.

    百个致富典型  今日为何沉落
    最近，有关部门调查了攸县4年前出现的100个万元户，现在这些万元户都先后消声匿迹了，有的甚至成了困难户。为什么这些万元户都沉落了呢？
    追求阔气，盲目消费。这100个万元户，4年来有78户建了新房，有的只是为了摆阔气。银坑乡有个运输专业户吴某，全家4口人，原有五六间旧屋，1982年，他增盖了3间新房。他搞运输发家以后，嫌住房不气派，又把原来的房屋统统拆掉，花3万多元盖了一栋两层楼房，还修有车库。如今，他的住房在当地是首屈一指。可是运输业出现了不景气，汽车被卖了，全家的收入不如以前。有些万元户在婚丧嫁娶上，大讲排场。有的为父母办丧事，一次开销近万元；有的为嫁女，所花费用等于建一栋新房的开销。这些农民手里有了钱，没有把剩余资金用于扩大再生产，而是肆意挥霍。于是，长途贩运户没本钱，办企业的缺资金。种粮大户买不起化肥、农药。
    八方伸手，强要白拿。攸县种植专业户陈普传有“银耳大王”之称。他出名后，取经、求助的信件雪片似地飞来，登门求教者络绎不绝。据陈普传的记事本记载：1982年至1985年，登门求教的3000多人次，其中接待住宿近2000人次，就餐达2700人次。陈普传应邀无偿为5省67个县讲授银耳种植技术和致富经验，自费印刷了5000份银耳种植技术资料赠送来访者。4年来，几乎每天都有来信来人向他借钱、募捐，要他尽义务，直到他穷困潦倒。
    宣传过头，名不副实，起了反作用。农村实行责任制后，农民陈福元成了养鸭专业户。这时，领导干部登门看望，政府部门总结经验材料，新闻记者来采访，这下，他成了致富先进，是攸县100个万元户中的一个。其实，陈福元养鸭没有赚到多少钱。有关部门把他拉入了全县100个万元户行列，真是赶鸭子上树。这只上了树的鸭子，为了装门面，把别人的碾米机、柴油机弄到自己家里，结果锒铛入狱。另有几户被宣传得名不副实的富裕户，有的自感本地难以立足，只好告别故土到外省落户，有的仍然过着贫困的日子。
    攸县1984年出现的100个万元户虽然沉落了，但是有更多的农民走上了勤劳致富的道路。目前，全县新出现的各类专业户达5600多户。攸县农民勤劳致富的形势是喜人的。但是，我们不能忘记100个万元户沉落的事实，以便使走上富裕道路的农民稳步地走下去。
