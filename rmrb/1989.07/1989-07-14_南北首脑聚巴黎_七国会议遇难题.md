Some developing countries have once again called for the resumption of South-North dialogue, posing a challenge to the upcoming summit of the Group of Seven (G7) leaders.

Yesterday, leaders from Egypt, India, Senegal, and Venezuela, who came to Paris to participate in the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, issued a joint statement urging developed and developing countries to take steps to convene regular consultations between South and North leaders as soon as possible.

According to reports from here, among the more than 30 national leaders and representatives gathered in Paris, over 20 bilateral meetings were held yesterday. The South-North dialogue was a topic of discussion, with many expressing interest or support for the aforementioned proposal.

However, this proposal has presented a dilemma for the G7 leaders, who had originally planned to discuss only the debt issues of Third World countries. It is noted that since the 1981 Cancun summit, developed countries have not prioritized the South-North dialogue. Countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom have shown indifference towards this issue.

The statement initiated by leaders Hosni Mubarak, Rajiv Gandhi, Abdou Diouf, and Jaime Lusinchi called for French leadership in supporting this initiative. Yesterday, President François Mitterrand, during his meeting with Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, expressed his approval. However, a spokesperson from the presidential office stated that this summit would not make a decision on convening a South-North summit.

    南北首脑聚巴黎  七国会议遇难题
    本报巴黎7月14日电　记者张启华报道：一些发展中国家再次要求开展南北对话，即将召开的西方七国首脑会议又遇难题。
    昨天，前来巴黎参加庆祝法国大革命200周年活动的埃及、印度、塞内加尔和委内瑞拉四国领导人在一项共同声明中呼吁，发达国家和发展中国家应采取步骤，尽早召开定期磋商的南北首脑会议。
    据此间报道，在云集巴黎的30多个国家领导人和代表中，昨天进行了20多场双边会晤，南北对话是他们交谈中的一个话题，其中不少人对上述建议表示兴趣或支持。
    但这项建议给原来只准备讨论第三世界国家债务问题的七国首脑们带来了难题。人们指出，从1981年坎昆会议起，发达国家一直没有把南北对话问题放到重要日程上。一些国家，如美国、英国对此表示冷淡。
    由穆巴拉克、拉·甘地、迪乌夫和佩雷斯四位领导人发起的这项声明要求法国方面带头支持。昨天，密特朗总统与印度拉·甘地总理会晤时已表示赞许。但总统府发言人认为，这次首脑会议不可能就召开南北会议问题做出决定。
