I give you a spring lake
The lake water wanders with my admiration
The black shadows of the trees by the lake
Always hide your distant return from the sun
The sun shines on your heart
The moon makes you even more gentle
Loneliness is also so beautiful
Longing fills the beautiful solitude
The seasons stretch out the past
Wind-informers quietly descend upon my heart

I give you a spring lake
Gently flowing into your heart
Moistening your lungs
In the hot summer and the desolate autumn

The distant mountains, the distant mountains
In my eyes, they are calm
The cuckoo bird flies away, another season
Bids me farewell
Your lips, your smile, are all a small, delicate poem
Often sneak into my dreams
You have gone far away
To the land that often keeps me awake

But, the spring wind will quietly follow you
Like a butterfly resting on the window sill
When you look back at this beautiful city

    我送你一方春天的湖（外一首）
    王月华我送你一方春天的湖湖水徜徉着我的爱慕湖畔上黑色的林荫总把你遥远归期遮住太阳照着你的心月亮使你更温柔寂寞也那么艳丽相思结满美的孤独季节拉长了往事风信花悄悄降临在心头我送你一方春天的湖款款注入你的心房滋润你的肺腑在炎热的盛夏和萧瑟的深秋
    远处的山远处的山在我眼里沉着布谷鸟飞走了又一个季节向我告别你的朱唇、笑靥都是一首小巧玲珑的诗常常潜入我的梦你远去了到常使我失眠的土地不过，春天的风会悄悄的跟随你像落在窗棂上的蝴蝶当你回首这座美丽的都市
