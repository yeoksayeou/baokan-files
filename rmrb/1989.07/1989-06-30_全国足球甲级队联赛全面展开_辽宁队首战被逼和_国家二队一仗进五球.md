The highest level of domestic football competition—the National Football First Division League A Group matches—began on June 29 in two coastal cities known for their football traditions: Qingdao and Dalian.

In the Qingdao venue, last year's national league champion Liaoning team drew 1-1 with the PLA team. This intense match, played in the rain, saw the PLA team's Zeng Fanqin score first in the first half. In the second half, Liaoning substituted in players like Huang Chong and launched a fierce counterattack, eventually equalizing with a goal by Fu Bo.

In the Dalian venue, two strong teams from Guangdong, Guangdong team and Guangzhou team, both had disappointing starts. The Guangdong team lost 0-2 to the Shandong team, while the Guangzhou team suffered a 0-5 defeat against the National Second Team. The National Second Team's energetic all-out attacking and defending style left a deep impression on the Dalian fans. They dominated the first half, allowing the Guangzhou team only one shot on goal, while scoring four goals themselves. In the second half, the National Second Team added another goal.

After a period of rest, the B Group matches of the First Division League resumed in Changsha and Zhengzhou on June 28. The results of the matches played on June 28 and 30 are as follows: Beijing team defeated Tianjin Port team 4-1 and drew 0-0 with the Shenyang Military Region team; Shenyang team defeated the Shenyang Military Region team 2-0 and drew 0-0 with the Henan team; Beijing Military Region team lost 0-1 to Henan team and defeated Tianjin Port team 2-1; Dalian team defeated Hebei team 2-0 and Jiangsu team 1-0; Tianjin Tianrong team defeated Hunan team 1-0 and drew 0-0 with Hubei team; Hubei team defeated Jiangsu team 2-1; Hebei team defeated Hunan team 1-0.

    在青岛赛区，去年全国联赛冠军辽宁队与八一队战成1平。这场雨中激战争夺激烈，八一队在上半时由曾繁钦首开纪录。下半时辽宁队换上黄崇等勇将，奋力反攻，终于由傅博扳回一球。
