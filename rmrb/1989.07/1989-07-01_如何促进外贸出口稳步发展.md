By the end of March this year, China's total foreign loans had reached over $12.3 billion, and the country's foreign exchange reserves had exceeded $17.4 billion. However, the development of reform, opening up, and construction all require a large amount of foreign exchange.

Facing the pressure of foreign exchange shortages, how to choose practical strategies to promote the steady development of China's foreign trade exports is a pressing issue in the process of reform and opening up. Recently, the reporter interviewed some leaders and experts from the economic and trade departments in Beijing and other regions. Their views have opened up new avenues for expanding exports and earning foreign exchange.

It is important to coordinate domestic and foreign sales, but more effort needs to be put into optimizing the export product structure.

Currently, China's foreign trade exports do face some difficulties, such as the tight supply of energy and raw materials needed for the production of export goods, and the lack of suitable bulk export commodities. However, there are also many favorable conditions for foreign trade exports. To promote the steady growth of foreign trade exports, two key aspects must be addressed: coordinating domestic and foreign sales, and making significant efforts to adjust the export product structure. For commodities with abundant domestic resources and significant production potential, as much as possible should be organized for export, especially increasing the export of light industrial products, clothing, handicrafts, processed foods, building and decorative materials, mechanical and electrical products, and household appliances, as well as agricultural products that earn foreign exchange. For commodities needed both domestically and internationally, a portion should be allocated for export.

In economically scarce countries, the potential for expanding exports mainly lies in optimizing the export product structure. In recent years, with the improvement of domestic production technology and the softening of international market prices for primary products such as oil, coupled with the tight supply of raw materials and some agricultural and sideline products in the domestic market, the export of industrial manufactured goods, processing with supplied materials, and processing with imported materials have all developed. Last year, the export of industrial manufactured goods accounted for 64.4% of all export commodities. The proportion of national income from foreign trade exports increased from 6.1% in 1985 to 10.9% in 1988. Since 1985, the growth in export volume has mainly been driven by the significant increase in the export of processed industrial manufactured goods. Domestic market-scarce commodities such as crude oil, refined oil, rice, corn, and pork have not only not increased in export volume but have actually decreased year by year.

This year, efforts are being made in three areas to adjust the export structure: first, fully utilizing existing and surplus production capacities after adjustments to increase the production of high-value-added processed products and promote product value-addition; second, developing processing with supplied materials and processing with imported materials to increase the proportion of "both ends outside" products in export trade; third, accelerating the development of high-tech product exports.

The key to eliminating the situation where "tight foreign sales squeeze domestic sales, and tight domestic sales pressure foreign sales" is to update concepts and master scale.

The formulation of foreign trade export policies must be based on China's national conditions and the overall modernization construction. Currently, two aspects of concepts need to be strengthened: first, foreign trade should be seen as an "accelerator" for economic development and technological progress. Some economic experts believe that the more economically scarce a country is, the more it should focus on developing foreign trade and widely participate in international exchanges. Second, the comprehensive social benefits of import and export trade need to be strengthened. From a micro-management perspective, each import and export transaction should be strictly accounted for to achieve the best economic benefits. However, from a strategic perspective, the comprehensive benefits of import and export trade are more important. If only the profits or losses of exports or imports are considered, it is likely to affect the normal development of our import and export trade, and even cause it to stagnate. In recent years, some people have believed that China's export products are cheap and imported goods are expensive, making it unprofitable. Here, there is a concept of comprehensive economic benefits. In recent years, China's imports of production materials have accounted for about 80% of the total imports, mainly including domestic scarce materials such as fertilizers, steel, rubber, timber, and wool, as well as advanced and applicable technologies and equipment. These imports have strongly promoted China's economic development. It is estimated that for every $100 million in imported materials, domestic industrial output value can increase by $150 million; exporting $100 million worth of industrial products can achieve a domestic output value of $580 million. In the first eight years of opening up, the number of introduced technology projects put into production reached more than 10,000, with a cumulative increase in output value of 110.7 billion yuan and a creation of profit and tax revenue of approximately 25.7 billion yuan.

Strengthen macro-control, eliminate "internal wars," and enhance the ability to cope with "shortages."

Implementing the foreign trade contract responsibility system nationwide has gradually shifted China's foreign trade from a system of collective profit and loss to a system of self-reliance, further mobilizing the enthusiasm of local and enterprise efforts to expand exports. This is undoubtedly of particular importance for China's foreign trade under the pressure of shortages. However, leaders and experts in the foreign trade sector have also noticed new problems arising from this: due to the rapid increase in the number of units with foreign trade operating rights, the vitality of "block economies" has increased, leading to chaotic phenomena such as price hikes for purchases and price cuts for sales, and various "wars" are constantly occurring. The foreign trade departments bear some responsibility for these "wars," but the fundamental reason is not in foreign trade. It is a special economic phenomenon in the transitional period of the new and old systems under China's current shortage economy. Last year's silk cocoon war, cashmere war, chestnut war, and many others were all related to foreign trade. However, there were also "wars" in markets that foreign trade had not yet entered or had withdrawn from. Leaders and experts in the foreign trade departments analyzed the main reasons for these "wars" as: prices have not been rationalized, and for commodities under the dual-track pricing system, some prices have been liberalized, but management has not kept up; under the shortage economy, the total demand has long been greater than the total supply; the management mechanism is not sound, and the new order has not been quickly established and improved; due to the implementation of regional and industrial tilt policies, coupled with the imbalance in economic development in various regions, unequal competition has been created.

For stopping the "wars," the foreign trade departments are not inactive, but they cannot solve the problem alone and need comprehensive governance. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Trade submitted to the State Council its opinions on preventing "wars" in 20 commodities, proposing specific measures to stop the "wars." These measures focus on two points: strengthening macro-control and enhancing the enterprise's self-discipline mechanism. However, economic experts are not satisfied with this and show greater enthusiasm for exploring how to eliminate the "internal war" issues.

    如何促进外贸出口稳步发展
    本报记者　陆振华
    到今年3月底，我国对外借款总额达123亿多美元，国家外汇储备总额虽已超过174亿美元，但改革、开放建设的发展都需要大量的外汇。
    面对外汇短缺的压力，如何选择切实可行的对策，推动我国外贸出口保持稳定发展的势头，这是改革开放中一个十分紧迫的问题。最近，记者采访了北京和外地经贸部门的一些领导和专家，他们谈及的许多意见，为扩大出口创汇开拓了思路。
    搞好内外销统筹兼顾固然重要，但更需花力气优化出口产品结构
    目前，我国外贸出口确实碰到不少难题，如出口商品生产所需能源和原材料紧张，适销的大宗出口商品不足等，但是，外贸出口也有不少有利条件。为了促进外贸出口稳定增长，必须抓好两个重要环节：搞好内外销统筹兼顾；下大力气调整出口产品结构。对国内资源丰富，增产潜力较大的商品，尽可能多组织出口，特别要增加轻工、服装、工艺品、加工食品、建筑和装饰材料、机电产品和家用电器等工业制成品和创汇农业产品出口。对国内外市场都需要的商品，要挤一部分出口。
    在经济短缺的国家，扩大出口的潜力主要在于优化出口产品结构。近几年来，随着国内生产科技水平的提高，加上国际市场石油等初级产品价格疲软、国内市场原材料和某些农副产品供应又偏紧的实情，工业制成品出口，来料加工和进料加工，获得了发展。去年工业制成品出口已占全部出口商品的64.4％，全国出口贸易额占国民生产总值的比例由1985年的6.1％提高到1988年的10.9％。1985年以来出口额的增长，主要是靠加工业制成品出口的大幅度增加，国内市场紧缺的原油、成品油、大米、玉米、猪肉等，出口量不仅没有增加，而且逐年减少。
    今年以来，在出口结构调整上正在从以下三个方面作出更大的努力：一是充分发挥已有的和调整后多余的生产能力，增加附加值高的加工产品生产，促使产品增值；二是发展进料加工和来料加工，提高“两头在外”产品在出口贸易中的比重；三是加快发展高技术产品出口。
    消除“外销紧了挤内销，内销紧了压外销”的关键是更新观念，掌握规模
    制定对外贸易的出口政策，必须从我国的国情和现代化建设的全局出发。当前有两方面的观念需要强化：首先，要把外贸看作国民经济发展和科技进步的“加速器”。有些经济专家认为，越是经济短缺的国家，越要重视发展对外贸易。广泛参加国际交换。第二，要强化进出口贸易的综合社会效益观念。从微观管理来说，对每宗进出口生意都应当要求严格核算，求得最好的经济效益。但从战略上来看，进出口贸易的综合效益更为重要。如果仅仅考虑出口或进口的盈亏，那么很可能影响我们进出口贸易的正常发展，甚至会裹足不前。近年来有些人认为我国出口的产品便宜，进口的东西贵，不合算。这里有个综合经济效益的观念。我国近年来进口的生产资料约占进口总量的80％，主要是国内紧缺的化肥、钢材、橡胶、木材、羊毛等物资和先进适用的技术设备。这些进口有力地促进了我国经济发展。据测算，每进口1亿元物资，可增加国内工业产值1.5亿元；出口1亿美元的工业品，可以实现国内5.8亿元产值。对外开放的头8年，投入生产的引进技术项目达1万多项，累计增加产值1107亿元，创造利润税收约257亿元以上。
    加强宏观控制，消除“内战”，增强对付“短缺”的承受力
    在全国范围内全面推行对外贸易承包经营责任制，把我国外贸由统负盈亏、吃“大锅饭”的体制逐步推向自负盈亏的体制，进一步调动了地方和企业扩大出口的积极性，这对处在短缺压力下的我国对外贸易，无疑具有特别重要的意义。但是，外贸界的领导和专家，也看到由此带来的新问题：由于拥有外贸经营权的单位增加过多过快，“块块经济”活力增强，带来了抬价收购、削价竞销的紊乱现象，各种“大战”不断。经贸部门对于“大战”应负有一定的责任，但大战的根本原因不在于外贸，它是新旧体制交替时期，我国短缺经济现状下的一种特殊经济现象。去年出现的茧丝大战、羊绒大战、板栗大战等，许多都与外贸有关，但是，也有外贸尚未涉足或已退出市场的，也出现“大战”。经贸部门领导和专家分析造成“大战”的主要原因是：价格没有理顺，实行价格双轨制的商品，有一部分价格放开，管理没跟上；短缺经济情况下长期存在的总需求大于总供给；管理机制不健全，新的秩序没有很快建立和完善；由于实行地区和行业倾斜政策，再加上各地经济发展不平衡，造成不平等竞争。
    对于制止“大战”，经贸部门不是无所作为的，但是也不是一家就能解决，需要综合治理。最近，经贸部向国务院上报防止20种商品“大战”的意见，提出了制止“大战”的具体措施。这些措施的着眼于两点：加强宏观控制；强化企业自我约束机制。但是，经济专家对此并不满足，而对如何消除“内战病灶”的探索显示出更大的热情。
