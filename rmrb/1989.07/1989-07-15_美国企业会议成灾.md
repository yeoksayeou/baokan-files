Title: Meetings Run Rampant in American Enterprises

	Across the Pacific in the United States, in the business world that emphasizes efficiency, meetings have become a plague.

	Many managers in American enterprises often find themselves immersed in a sea of meetings every day. Chairmen spend an average of 17 hours per week in meetings, which means nearly half of their time is spent in conference rooms. Senior managers spend an average of 23 hours per week in meetings, while even middle-level managers have to attend more than two hours of meetings daily.

	Tomson, the president of the company that produces reinforced plastics, Jenco, said, "Fortunately, the meetings I attend haven't turned into a 'chatter club' yet."

	In many American enterprises, even if there are no clear agendas, meetings cannot be reduced. This is because conference rooms are closely tied to power. Promotions are decided in meetings, and demotions or dismissals are also decided in meetings. Whether a chairman is competent is mainly demonstrated through meetings. Middle-level managers, in order to climb the ladder, often engage in fierce verbal battles in meetings.

	Generally, for a manager to get promoted, they need to be able to sit still and have the patience to endure meetings. For them, just hastily reviewing related reports and records the night before a meeting is not enough. To prepare for a meeting, they often need to hold preparatory meetings, which is an important task.

	For example, if the advertising manager of a consumer goods production company wants to launch a new advertisement, they must first hold a meeting to gain the support of colleagues or subordinates, and then report to their superiors.

	Another problem with the "meeting plague" in American enterprises is that meetings often do not start on time. High-level executives are usually late, so the executing managers also rarely arrive on time. Meetings scheduled for 9 AM rarely start before 9:20 AM.

	The chairman of a large enterprise is often half an hour late to meetings. After arriving, he would justify his lateness by saying, "I'm not late. The meeting only starts after I arrive." His subordinates dare not express their anger.

	The rampant meetings certainly affect work. Meetings often go off-topic, last indefinitely, and involve people who have no business being there, wasting countless hours and energy.

	It is said that there are some American enterprises that hold short and effective meetings, but such enterprises are reportedly few and far between.

    美国企业会议成灾 
    丁一
    在大洋彼岸的美国，在讲究效率的企业界，会议成灾了。
    美国的许多企业经理，往往要天天都泡在会海里。董事长平均每周开会17小时，也就是说每天要有近一半时间花在会议室里。那些高级经理则平均每周要被会议占掉23个小时，即便中层管理人员也要每天开上两个多小时的会。
    生产增强塑料的珍科公司总裁汤姆森说，幸亏他参加的会议还不至于成为“漫谈俱乐部”。
    在许多美国企业里，即便没有什么明确的议题，但会议也不能减少。因为会议室和权力紧紧联系在一起。提升是在会议上决定，而降级乃至解职也是在会议上决定的。一家企业的董事长是否治理有方，也主要通过会议表现出来。而中层管理干部们为了向上爬，往往在会议上少不了一番唇枪舌剑之战。
    一般来说，一个经理要想得到提拔，就得屁股坐得住，有在会里“泡”的功夫。对他们来说，只在会议前一天晚上匆忙看一下有关的报告和记录是不够的。为了开好会，往往还得开准备会，这是一项重要工作。
    例如一家消费品生产企业的广告部经理想搞一个新的广告，他就必须先开会，得到同事或下级的支持，然后再向他的上级报告。
    会议不准时是美国企业界“会议灾害”的又一弊病。企业的高层人士总是姗姗来迟，于是那些执行经理便也很少准时与会。上午9时的会很少能在9时20分开起来。
    某大企业的董事长总是晚半小时到会。而驾到之后他还煞有其事地辩解道：
    “我没迟到。因为我到了后会议才开始。”他的部下当然是敢怒而不敢言。
    会议成灾当然影响工作，开会离题万里，时间无限拉长，一些与会无关的人也参加，不知要浪费多少时间和精力。
    据说也有一些美国企业开的会议短而精，但据说这样的企业为数较少。
