As the reform deepens, enterprises are becoming more profound and meticulous. The era of pursuing production volume and speed alone must come to an end; the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach must be abandoned. Only by shifting from a rough management style to a fine-tuned one can enterprises meet the demands of the times. Xiao Ganghua's Strategy:

Speed must serve efficiency, production value must yield to efficiency.

Someone predicted: Entering the 1990s, enterprises that dare to take risks will succeed; entrepreneurs with a pioneering spirit will succeed.

Let us tell a true and thought-provoking story.

In Liuzhou, Guangxi, there is a canned food factory. Built 12 years ago, it has had 8 different directors, and has been in the red every year. By the end of 1987, the cumulative loss was 2.52 million yuan, equivalent to losing two factories (the net value of the factory's fixed assets was 1.28 million yuan).

At the end of 1987, the factory, as a pilot project, publicly recruited a director from society. Xiao Ganghua, a young and energetic man, was selected in January 1988. After taking office, Xiao Ganghua adopted unique measures to manage the factory. As a result, the factory achieved a tax and profit of 1.528 million yuan in that year, exceeding the three-year contract target by a large margin. In the first half of this year, despite the continued tightening of monetary policy and a 34% increase in the price of the main raw material, white sugar, the factory's performance continued to rise steadily.

When Xiao Ganghua took office, the factory had 1.4 million yuan worth of inventory backlog, plus accumulated losses, the funds that the factory could not use for normal turnover accounted for 90% of the total working capital. Xiao Ganghua believed that this was an extremely abnormal phenomenon for an enterprise. If production continued and inventory increased, the burden would become heavier. Therefore, he decided to stop production immediately and focus on sales. That month, the sales revenue was 470,000 yuan, which not only eased the financial strain but also provided a large amount of market information. After half a year of normal production, inventory again showed signs of accumulation. To prevent excessive deposition of working capital, Xiao Ganghua decided to stop production for 10 days again.

Xiao Ganghua said: "The logic is simple. The products produced by an enterprise must eventually be sold, and the proceeds must be collected. When the products show signs of accumulation, continuing to produce blindly is meaningless."

Using the stoppage period, they also made appropriate adjustments to the product structure. Previously, the factory produced both canned food and cold fruit. Although canned food had high production value, the efficiency was very low, while cold fruit production required less capital and had high efficiency. Xiao Ganghua decided to stop canned food production and increase cold fruit production. Thus, the annual production value would be 1.8 million yuan less than in 1987, a 40% decrease. Although this approach contradicted the prevailing emphasis on production value, there was significant resistance, but practice proved that this decision was correct. From March to the end of 1988, the factory produced 801 tons of cold fruit, with a production value of 2.5 million yuan and realized a tax and profit of 1.42 million yuan. If canned food production had been maintained, to achieve such tax and profit, a production value of 25 million yuan would have been needed, which was impossible for Liuzhou Canned Food Factory with its current investment scale.

Cui Honglu's Tactics:

Prudent economic accounting, strict rules and regulations

In the future, for a considerable period, what path should Chinese enterprises take to deepen their reforms? At a national conference, some enterprise leaders proposed that they should take the path of low speed, tight control, and high efficiency. They suggested that the government's evaluation of enterprises should be standardized, mainly evaluating the fixed asset tax and profit rate, sales tax and profit rate, working capital turnover days, and comparable cost reduction rate.

Some people analyzed that for most enterprises, the main factors causing high costs and low efficiency are high material consumption. Therefore, the fundamental way to significantly improve enterprise economic efficiency is to strictly control material consumption, reduce costs, and speed up capital turnover.

However, this requires even more meticulous management of the enterprise.

In the former capital of Qi State – Zibo, Shandong, there is a Qi Lu Ethylene Weaving Factory. This factory has been in operation for more than a year, and its main economic indicators have all exceeded the national second-class enterprise standards. Among them, per capita annual tax and profit and labor productivity have even exceeded the national first-class enterprise standards. However, several nearby factories, under the same equipment, same products, and same conditions, created much lower efficiency. What is the secret behind this? If we carefully examine the Qi Lu Ethylene Weaving Factory, we will find that they have focused on fine management.

The factory is divided into several workshops such as drawing, weaving, and bag weaving. Each workshop operates at its best state, truly achieving full load for both personnel and machinery. In the production process, they not only focus on quantity and quality but also pay special attention to reducing the defect rate. For example, in the drawing workshop, the defect rate is less than 1%, meaning the product qualification rate is over 99%, while general similar enterprises can only achieve 98%. Just this item alone, the factory can increase revenue by more than 200,000 yuan per year.

The woven bags they produce are of good quality and light weight. They calculated that if each bag saves 1 gram of raw material, then producing 25 million bags a year can save 25 tons of raw materials, worth over 230,000 yuan. And the plastic woven bags produced by this factory are generally 5 grams lighter than similar products from other factories, meeting quality requirements and increasing income. Just this item alone can increase revenue by over 100,000 yuan per year. For example, in manual bag cutting, the error is required to be within plus or minus 1 centimeter. They fully utilize the allowable error range in production to save as much as possible. They believe that saving half a centimeter or adding half a centimeter can be accounted for, and saving one centimeter per bag can increase revenue by nearly 300,000 yuan per year.

These seemingly trivial matters have created great benefits for the enterprise. Using the lowest cost and the least raw materials to produce the best products is the unremitting goal of Shandong Zibo Qi Lu Ethylene Weaving Factory.

Factory director Cui Honglu said that the enterprise must be meticulous in every aspect, and the slightest negligence will result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of yuan. Modern enterprise management work can only become more and more meticulous, without the slightest carelessness. Qi Lu Ethylene Weaving Factory's strengthening of fine management has created relatively high economic benefits, ranking at the forefront of the industry. Take the capital utilization rate as an example. The turnover target set by the superior department is 130 days, but last year their capital turnover was 81 days, and this year's first quarter further reduced to 46 days.

Implementing fine management in production and operation necessarily requires workers to have a higher level of quality. Surprisingly, most of the workers at Qi Lu Ethylene Weaving Factory come from rural areas. In the early days of the factory's establishment, they focused on regular training for workers, on-the-job guidance, and also established strict rules and regulations. The factory places great importance on the role of technical personnel, investing heavily in training and introducing a large number of various professional technical personnel. This factory with only 500 workers has spent more than 600,000 yuan on intellectual investment. More than 180 people have received more than one year of professional training from colleges and universities, 240 people have participated in enterprise management and total quality management training, and the quality of workers has reached a very high level.

"High-quality personnel are the solid foundation for strictly implementing various rules and regulations." Director Cui Honglu is full of confidence in his enterprise. He said: "No matter how the objective environment changes, our enterprise can ensure that it operates in an orderly manner according to the factory's regulations. This is our foundation." Today, Qi Lu Ethylene Weaving Factory has become a jewel in the local area. Everyone who has visited this factory has clearly seen this change. Moving towards fine management is the inevitable path for modern enterprises.

    从“粗犷”到“精细”
    ——兼评企业管理的一个新趋势
    本报记者　刘国胜
    随着改革的不断深入，企业变得愈加深沉和精细。单纯追求产值、速度的年代需要告别；“一刀切”的传统作法必须摈弃：粗犷的经营方式只有让位于精细的管理才能适应时代要求。肖刚华的对策：
    速度服从效益，产值让位于效益
    有人预言：进入90年代，能获得成功的企业必将是那些敢于冒风险的企业；能获得成功的企业家必将是具有开拓进取精神的企业家。
    让我们讲一个真实而又耐人寻味的故事。
    广西柳州市有一家罐头食品厂，建厂12年换了8任厂长，连年亏损，截至1987年底，累计亏损252万元，相当于亏掉了两个厂（该厂固定资产净值为128万元）。
    1987年底，这个厂作为试点向社会公开招聘厂长。肖刚华，一位精力充沛的年轻人，于1988年1月中标。肖刚华上任后，采取独特的治厂措施。结果，这个厂当年实现税利152.8万元，一年超额完成三年的承包合同规定的税利任务。今年头半年，尽管银根继续紧缩，主要原材料白糖涨价34％，该厂效益仍稳步上升。
    肖刚华上任时，这个厂有140万元的库存积压产品，加上累计亏损，工厂不能参加正常周转的资金占全部流动资金的90％。肖刚华认为，作为企业，这是极不正常的现象，如果继续生产，加大库存，包袱会愈背愈重。于是，他决定立即停产，全力以赴抓推销。当月销售收入47万元，不仅缓解了资金紧张的局面，同时还掌握了大量市场信息。在恢复正常生产持续半年后，库存又显露出积压苗头，肖刚华为防止流动资金过分沉淀，又决定停产10天。
    肖刚华说：“道理很简单，企业生产的产品最终是要销售出去，把货款收回来，当产品出现积压时，仍盲目生产，就没有任何意义了。”
    利用停产时机，他们还对产品结构进行了适当调整。以往，这个厂既生产罐头又生产凉果，生产罐头尽管产值高，效益却很低，而生产凉果占用资金少，效益高。肖刚华决定停下罐头，增产凉果生产。这样，全年产值要比承包前的1987年下降180万元，下降幅度达40％。尽管这一做法与时尚的重产值观点相悖，阻力不小，但实践证明，这个决策是正确的。自1988年3月至年底，该厂共生产凉果801吨，产值250万元，实现税利142万元。如果仍以生产罐头为主，要实现这样的税利，则需要达到2500万元的产值，以柳州市罐头食品厂现有投资规模，这是根本做不到的。崔洪禄的招数：
    精明的经济核算，严密的规章制度
    今后相当长一个时期内，我国企业深化改革应走什么路子？在一次全国性会议上，有的企业领导者提出，应该走低速、紧缩、高效的道路。建议政府对企业的考核要规范化，主要考核企业的固定资产税利率、销售税利率、流动资金周转天数和可比成本降低率。
    有人分析，对于大多数企业来说，造成成本偏高、效益差的主要因素是物耗偏高。所以，大幅度提高企业经济效益的根本办法是狠压物耗，降低成本，加快资金周转。
    然而，这就需要更加精细地管理企业。
    在齐国故都——山东淄博市，有一家齐鲁乙烯塑编厂，这个厂投产一年多，主要经济指标都超过了国家二级企业标准，其中人均年创税利和全员劳动生产率还超过了国家一级企业标准。而周围几个厂家，在同样设备、同样产品、同样条件下，所创造出的效益却远远不如齐鲁乙烯塑编厂。这其中有什么奥秘吗？如果我们仔细考察一下齐鲁乙烯塑编厂，那么，你就会发现，他们在精细管理上下了功夫。
    这个厂分拔丝、织布、编袋等几个车间，每个车间的运转都达到了最佳状态，真正做到人机满负荷。在生产过程中，他们不仅讲求产量和质量，而且特别注意降低废品率。比如拔丝车间，废品率不到1％，也就是说产品合格率达到99％以上，而一般同类企业只能达到98％，仅此一项，这个厂每年可增收20多万元。
    他们生产的编织袋，质量好，重量轻。他们算过一笔帐，如果每条袋子节省一克原料，那么年产2500万条塑编袋，一年就可节约25吨原料，价值23万多元。而这个厂生产的塑料编织袋一般比别厂的同类产品轻5克，既符合质量要求又增加了收入，仅此一项每年可增收100多万元。又比如人工切袋子，要求误差在正负1公分之内，他们在生产中充分利用允许的误差范围，尽可能做到节省。他们认为，短半公分，或长半公分，都有帐可算，一条袋子节省一公分，每年就可增收近30万元。
    上述这些看起来是极细微的事，却给企业创出了大效益。用最低的成本，最省的原料，生产出最好的产品，这就是山东淄博齐鲁乙烯塑编厂不断奋斗的目标。
    厂长崔洪禄说，企业必须处处精打细算，稍一疏忽，就会有百八十万元流失掉。现代企业管理工作只能愈来愈精细，不得有半点马虎。齐鲁乙烯塑编厂加强精细管理，创造出较高的经济效益，在同行业中名列前茅。仅以资金利用率为例，上级部门下达的资金周转指标是130天，去年他们的资金周转为81天，今年一季度又减少到46天。
    生产经营实行精细化管理，必然要求职工具有较高的素质，令人惊奇的是，齐鲁乙烯塑编厂的职工大部分来自农村。针对这种情况，在建厂初期他们就抓职工正规培训，跟班指导，同时还建立了严密的规章制度。工厂十分重视技术人员的作用，不惜重金培训和引进大批各类专业技术人员。这家仅有500名职工的企业，在智力投资上就用去了60多万元，经过大专院校一年以上专业培训的有180多人，参加企业管理和全面质量管理培训的240人，职工素质达到相当高的水平。
    “人员的素质高是严格执行各项规章制度的坚实基础。”崔洪禄厂长对自己的企业充满信心，他说：“无论客观环境发生什么变化，我们的企业都能保证按厂内秩序运转，这就是我们的根基。”如今，齐鲁乙烯塑编厂已成为当地一颗明珠。凡是到这家工厂参观过的人，都明明白白地看到了这个变化。走向精细化管理，是现代企业的必由之路。
