    Gorbachev at the Franco-Soviet Summit Press Conference: Communism Has Not Encountered a Crisis
    Franco-Soviet Military Relations Resumed

    PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Soviet leader Gorbachev said that communism has not encountered a crisis, but only a problem of reform. He refuted the analysis by the Western public opinion that the reform in socialist countries would lead to failure. "Saying that capitalist society possesses eternal truth is just an illusion," he said. "Some people say that we are experiencing a crisis, but if they think so, they are wrong. We have not abandoned socialism, have not abandoned our values, have not abandoned the people's government. Marxism and communism have not encountered a crisis."

    This was what Gorbachev said at the joint press conference with French President Mitterrand at the Elysee Palace yesterday.

    The two leaders expressed satisfaction with the development of Franco-Soviet relations and the results of the Franco-Soviet summit talks.

    They also discussed the issue of joint construction of a common European house by Eastern and Western Europe.

    Gorbachev also talked about the reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe at the press conference. He pointed out, "Reforms are being actively carried out in the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries," but he also admitted, "The process of reform is complex and fragile, and there is a danger of instability and disruption, which will bring serious losses to the country and the world."

    PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The French Ministry of Defense announced that the Chief of the French Armed Forces, Maurice Schmitter, and the Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces, Mikhail Moiseyev, signed an agreement in Paris today to resume military relations between the two countries.

    The agreement stipulates that "military leaders and representatives of military academies of the two countries will conduct mutual visits" and "representatives of the three services will have contact on a reciprocal basis" during the period 1990-1991.

    戈氏在法苏首脑联合记者招待会上指出
    共产主义并未遇到危机
    法国苏联恢复军事关系
    本报巴黎7月6日电　记者吕网大报道：苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，共产主义并没有发生危机，只有革新问题。他对西方舆论界就社会主义国家的改革导致失败的所谓分析进行了驳斥。“说资本主义社会拥有永恒的真理只是幻想”，“有人说我们正在经历一场危机，如果这样认为他们就错了，我们没有放弃社会主义、没有放弃我们的价值、没有放弃人民政权。马克思主义和共产主义并没有遇到危机”。
    这是戈尔巴乔夫昨天与法国总统密特朗在爱丽舍宫联合举行记者招待会时讲这番话的。
    两位领导人对法苏关系的发展和法苏首脑会谈的结果表示满意。
    他们还谈到了东西欧联合建设共同的欧洲大厦问题。
    戈尔巴乔夫还在记者招待会上谈了苏联和东欧的改革。他指出，
  “改革正在苏联和东欧各国积极进行”，但他同时承认，“改革的进程是复杂的和脆弱的，还存在着出现不稳定和断裂的危险，这不仅会给本国、也会给世界带来严重损失。”
    据新华社巴黎7月5日电　法国国防部宣布，法国三军参谋长莫里斯·施密特和苏联武装力量参谋长米哈伊尔·莫伊谢耶夫今天在巴黎签署了一项协议，决定恢复两国军队之间的关系。
    协议规定，1990—1991年期间，两国的“军事首脑和军事院校的代表团将进行互访”，“三军代表将在互惠的基础上进行接触”。
