On a breezy midday, a man in his thirties was quietly observing someone in the long-distance bus station of Suzhou City's South Gate.

The man was Yang Jingbiao, a member of the Suzhou City Joint Defense Team specializing in anti-pickpocketing work. Just moments ago, the long-distance bus station had witnessed over a dozen instances of pickpocketing.

At that moment, an elderly woman in her sixties, wearing glasses and with her eyes half-closed, was sitting in the waiting room. It was a cool day, yet she held an umbrella in her hand.

The ticket gate at Gate 5 opened. The elderly woman quickly joined the crowd, only to retreat a moment later as if she had lined up in the wrong queue. Yang knew this was a common trick used by experienced pickpockets—“testing the waters” or “scouting the situation.” Inexperienced anti-pickpocket officers often get startled at this point, but Yang remained calm.

Soon, the ticket gate at Gate 3 opened. The elderly woman stood up and joined the queue. Yang estimated that she was about to strike, so he pretended to be a passenger and followed her. Just as a passenger was about to hand over his ticket at the gate, Yang saw the elderly woman sidestep, using her right hand with the umbrella to block the view, and her left hand swiftly reaching into the passenger's pocket. Yang, with his quick reflexes, grabbed her left hand. The elderly woman then pulled out a sharp knife from her waistband and lunged at Yang. Yang swiftly grabbed her right hand. The passenger's pocket was torn, and the wallet was in the elderly woman's hand.

Yang Jingbiao, now 38 years old, is a retired soldier. During his military service, he was a scout. In 1978, after retiring from the People's Liberation Army, he was assigned to work at the Suzhou Rubber Factory. In 1981, he joined the Suzhou City Joint Defense Team and began specializing in anti-pickpocketing work. He is passionate about his job and eagerly studies anti-pickpocketing techniques. He has learned from anti-pickpocketing veterans from the 1950s, such as Sun Mingzhi, Chen Dongquan, and Yang Fuhong, observing, listening, and questioning them to explore methods for identifying and apprehending pickpockets. Whenever he has free time, he carefully recalls and analyzes the behavior and patterns of pickpockets, noting their actions, slang, operating locations, and the subtle changes in their eyes, hands, posture, and positions before and after committing a crime, as well as the coordination of their accomplices. He then applies these observations to his anti-pickpocketing work. Additionally, he often visits bus drivers, ticket sellers, market managers, shop clerks, and reviews pickpocketing case records to understand the activities of pickpockets and determine key locations and directions for his anti-pickpocketing efforts, striving to increase the arrest rate.

Yang's dedication has paid off. Years of diligent practice have enabled him to identify pickpockets from the slang used by locals, such as “underground warfare,” “cutting the skin,” “opening a window,” “feeling the ditch,” and “waiting for the dragon head.” He can also recognize criminals from their unique eye movements and subtle actions like raising a hand, taking a step, or lowering a shoulder. In late 1986, he participated in the Jiangsu Provincial Public Security Bureau's anti-pickpocketing skills competition in Nanjing, where he caught 18 pickpockets in a week and ranked first. In early 1987, Yang was invited to Xuzhou to participate in the Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Pickpocketing Skills Competition, where he caught 17 pickpockets in six days and again topped the list.

To date, Yang Jingbiao has single-handedly caught 758 pickpockets, including notorious local criminals, the “Pipe Gang” from Northeast China, women with babies, and fashionable “rich ladies.” For his efforts, Yang has been named an active member of public security in Suzhou City for eight consecutive years. In July of last year, he was awarded the title of “Anti-Pickpocketing Expert” by the Suzhou City Public Security Bureau. The anti-pickpocketing team he leads has also been commended by the Suzhou City Government for seven consecutive years.

    抓贼能手
    ——记苏州市联防队队员杨靖彪
    李德合　顾新玉
    一个凉风习习的中午。苏州市南门长途汽车站里，一位三十多岁的年轻人正不动声色地监视着一个人。
    年轻人叫杨靖彪，是苏州市联防队专门从事反扒工作的队员。刚才，长途汽车站里连续发生了十多起划包行窃案件。
    此时，一名年逾花甲、戴着老花镜、双目微闭的老妪坐在候车室内。阴天凉爽，她怎么手执阳伞？
    五号门检票进站了。老妪快速拥向人流，一眨眼又像发觉排错队似的退了回来。小杨深知，此举是老扒手惯用伎俩——“投石问路”，也叫“试探军情”，反扒新手往往容易在这个时候打草惊蛇，而他却按兵不动。
    不一会儿，三号门检票放行。老妪又起身排队。小杨估计，她要下手了，便佯装旅客尾随其后。正当一旅客至检票口抬手举票的一瞬间，只见老妪一侧身，以右手中的阳伞作遮挡，左手迅速挨近那旅客口袋，尔后猛一回缩。小杨眼疾手快，紧紧卡住老妇左手。这时老妪右手滑向裤带，抽出锋利的尖刀猛刺过来，杨靖彪左手以迅雷不及掩耳之势一把擒住。看，前面旅客的口袋已被划破，钱包正捏在老妪手中……
    今年三十八岁的杨靖彪，是位退伍军人。在部队他当过侦察兵，一九七八年从解放军退役后，被安排在苏州橡胶厂工作，一九八一年参加苏州市联防队，从事专门反扒工作。他酷爱本职业务，如饥似渴地钻研反扒技能，先后拜五十年代的反扒老将孙明智、陈东权、杨富荣为师，眼看、耳听、嘴问、潜心探索识别和擒获、制服扒手的方法。平常一有空，他就仔细回忆、分析扒手作案时的举止神态和活动规律，从扒窃人员的行动特点、暗语、活动场所和他们作案前后的眼神、手势、体姿、位置以及同伙的配合动作等方面注意归纳总结，积累经验，然后运用到反扒斗争实践之中。此外，他还经常走访公共汽车驾驶员、售票员、农贸市场管理员、商店营业员、查阅扒窃案件登记簿，了解扒窃犯罪的活动情况，确定反扒的重点场所、部位和主攻方向，努力提高抓获率。
    功夫不负有心人。几年的刻苦演练，小杨不仅从路人讲的“地道战”、“斩皮子”、“开天窗”、“摸地沟”、“盼龙头”等黑话里，发现混迹人群的扒手，而且能从扒手特别的眼神和一抬手，一投足、一低肩的动作中识别出罪犯。一九八六年底，他参加江苏省公安厅在南京举行的全省“反扒能手现场表演赛”，一周抓获扒手十八名，名列第一。一九八七年初，杨靖彪应邀到徐州参加江苏省“反扒能手大会战”，六天擒获扒手十七名，再次荣登榜首。
    到目前为止，杨靖彪已只身抓获扒窃犯七百五十八名，其中有称王称霸、气焰嚣张的地头蛇，有来自东北的扒窃团伙“管子帮”，有怀抱婴儿的少妇，还有衣着入时、花枝招展的“阔小姐”。为此，小杨连续八年被苏州市评为治安积极分子，去年七月被苏州市公安局授予“反扒能手”荣誉称号。他带领的反扒小组也连续七年受到苏州市人民政府的表彰。
