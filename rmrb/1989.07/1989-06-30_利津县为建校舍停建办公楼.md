Lijin County in Shandong Province has halted the construction of an office building to build school facilities. The county's People's Congress, Political Consultative Conference, and 15 bureaus and commissions have been operating out of dilapidated brick-and-tile buildings within the county government compound for many years. In 1984, County Magistrate Yan Pengshan decided to build an office building.

In 1985, a wave of school building renovations swept through Shandong Province. Yan, the county magistrate, changed his mind about building the county government office building and decided to renovate some of the rundown schools within Lijin County. That year, 120 million yuan was raised to renovate old school buildings. In 1986, the county invested another 20 million yuan to provide new desks and chairs for rural schools.

In 1987, Yan, the county magistrate, had 4.8 million yuan in construction funds at his disposal. On one day in December, he convened a county magistrate's office meeting specifically to discuss the construction of the county government office building. During the meeting, Deputy County Magistrate Wang Qiao, who oversees education, said, "Lijin No. 1 Middle School still does not have a classroom building." During the two years of school building renovations, the county had built an office and laboratory building for Lijin No. 1 Middle School and a classroom building and teacher dormitory for Lijin No. 2 Middle School. However, the classrooms at Lijin No. 1 Middle School were still from the 1950s and in a state of disrepair. Therefore, the county leaders decided to allocate the 4.8 million yuan in construction funds to Lijin No. 1 Middle School. In February 1988, they also allocated 800,000 yuan in saved administrative funds to the school. Soon, the new classroom building for Lijin No. 1 Middle School was completed.

In 1989, the county leaders planned to build some school facilities for several schools. But what about the county government office building? Yan, the county magistrate, said, "We will not build it this year, nor in the next three years."

    利津县为建校舍停建办公楼
    山东利津县的县人大、政协，以及政府的15个局（委），多年来挤在县政府大院十几排红砖瓦平房里办公。1984年，县长阎鹏山决心盖一座办公楼。
    1985年，山东省出现了校舍改建高潮，阎县长改变了建县府办公楼的主意，决心将利津县境内一些黑屋子、土台子的学校进行改造，当年集资1200万元，改造了陈旧的校舍。1986年，县里又投资200万元，为农村学校配置了新桌、新凳。
    1987年，阎县长手里掌握有48万元基建款。12月的一天，他为建县府办公楼，专门召开了县长办公会议。会上，分管教育的副县长王桥说：“县一中还没有教学楼。”在校舍改建高潮的两年间，县里曾为县一中盖了一座办公实验楼；为县二中盖了教学楼和教师宿舍楼，可是，一中的教室还是50年代建的，一片破旧。于是县领导们决定把这48万元基建款拨给县一中。1988年2月，他们又将节省下来的8万元行政经费也给了县一中。不久，县一中的新教学大楼就建成了。
    进入1989年，县领导又准备为几所学校建一点校舍。可县府办公大楼呢？阎县长说：“今年不建，3年内也不建。”
