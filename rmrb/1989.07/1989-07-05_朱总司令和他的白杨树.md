49 years ago, during the intense phase of the national war of resistance against Japan, Marshal Zhu De planted a young white poplar tree in front of the Eighth Route Army headquarters in Wangjia Yu in Wuxiang County, Shanxi Province, while commanding the people's army in battle. Today, this poplar tree has grown into a towering tree over 20 meters tall.

In the summer, people enjoy taking shelter under the shade of the poplar tree. The rustling leaves whisper tales of Marshal Zhu De's great achievements and the changes in the countryside.

For many years, the people in the surrounding areas of Wangjia Yu have lived in relative poverty and had low educational levels. They yearned for scientific and cultural knowledge to quickly transform the backward economy and culture of the mountainous region. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, their wishes were realized. With the support of the township party committee and the county, city, and provincial governments, and even the central government, a middle school was established in Wangjia Yu in September 1979.

This middle school, though not large in scale, was established with direct funding from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Its location is adjacent to the former headquarters of the Eighth Route Army and next to the white poplar tree planted by Marshal Zhu De. Therefore, it was named "White Poplar Middle School." These facts show the Central Committee's concern for the cultural education of the people in the old revolutionary base areas of Taihang and also reflect the people's nostalgia for the Eighth Route Army and Marshal Zhu De.

When White Poplar Middle School was established, Zhu De's daughter, Zhu Min, came to congratulate. Later, several central leaders visited the school, and Madame Pu Anxiu, wife of Marshal Peng Dehuai, visited the school three times and donated books and funds. White Poplar Middle School has approximately 600 students. In addition to three years of cultural studies, students also undergo one year of specialized technical training (such as coal mining and agricultural machinery) to ensure that each student acquires a skill. The school follows the revolutionary educational tradition passed down by the older generation of revolutionaries, paying special attention to cultivating students' spirit of hard work and simplicity. Over the past 10 years, the school has trained over 1,300 graduates, the vast majority of whom have diligently worked to contribute to the economic and cultural development of their hometown with the knowledge and skills they have acquired.

Although the white poplar tree does not bear fruit, its extensive root system makes it highly effective in soil conservation and sand fixation. White Poplar Middle School has become an advanced educational institution in the rural areas of Shanxi Province. It symbolizes the fruit that has grown under the shade of Marshal Zhu De's great white poplar tree. On the 13th anniversary of Marshal Zhu De's passing, this "fruit," which is about to turn 50 and is still thriving, may serve as the best tribute to Marshal Zhu De.

    朱总司令和他的白杨树
    陈集
    49年前，当全国抗日战争紧张阶段，朱德总司令在指挥人民军队作战的间隙，在山西省武乡县王家峪八路军总部门前栽了一棵白杨树幼苗。如今这棵白杨已长成20多米高的参天大树了。
    盛夏季节，人们喜欢在白杨树荫下纳凉，微风吹得树叶沙沙作响，好像在轻声向人们追叙朱总司令的丰功伟绩和山乡的变迁。
    王家峪周围地区的人民多年来处于经济相对贫困环境中，知识水平也很低，他们渴望得到科学文化知识，迅速改变当地落后的山区经济和文化面貌。党的十一届三中全会以后，他们的愿望实现了。在乡党委和县、市、省直至中央的支持下，一所中学于1979年9月在王家峪建立起来。
    这所规模不大的初级中学是由中共中央直接拨款建立的，校址毗邻八路军总部旧址，紧傍朱总司令手植的白杨树，因此被命名为“白杨中学。”这些事实表明党中央对太行老区人民文化教育的关心，也反映了老区人民对八路军和朱总司令的怀念。
    白杨中学创办时，朱总司令的女儿朱敏同志即前往祝贺，以后一些中央领导同志相继去视察，彭德怀元帅夫人浦安修同志曾3次莅临该校并赠书赠款。白杨中学共有学生约600名，教学方针除3年文化学习外，学生仍须参加专门技术学习1年（如采煤专业和农机专业），以使每个学生掌握一技之长。该校遵循老一辈革命家传下来的革命教育传统，特别注重对学生进行艰苦朴素的思想政治教育。建校10年来，已培养了1300余名毕业生，绝大多数都能以所学的知识和技能为家乡的经济与文化发展勤恳地工作。
    白杨树虽然不结果实，而其根系发达，所以护土固沙的能力极强。白杨中学已成为山西省一个农村教育的先进单位，它象征着在朱总司令的大白杨树庇荫下所结出来的一颗鲜亮的果实。在朱总司令逝世13周年之际，这颗即将50周岁而且仍在茁壮成长的“鲜果”，也许可以作为对朱总司令最好的奠念吧。（附图片）
