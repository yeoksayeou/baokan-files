Observations from the Readers

Jiangsu Feng County:
Naked Aluminum Wires in Fields Are Stolen

Since last spring, naked aluminum wires in the fields of 25 townships in our county have been stolen multiple times, with dozens of village groups having their wires completely stripped away.

Our county's Huankou Township has a total of 36 administrative villages. Since last year, every village has had its wires stolen, with an average of over 2,000 meters of wire stolen per administrative village. The government seat of Huankou Township, Huankou Village, had 4 electric water pumps stolen and over 13,000 meters of naked aluminum wire stolen. Five village groups in this township had all their wires stolen. In Changzhuang Village, 15,000 meters of naked aluminum wire were stolen from the fields, and after new wires were installed in February of this year, over 5,000 meters of aluminum wire were stolen in one night.

Currently, such cases are continuously occurring throughout the county, severely impacting agricultural production.

To prevent and stop such cases, the broad masses of farmers in our county must strengthen guard duties, improve security measures, and promptly report and expose any issues that arise. Relevant departments must severely crack down on criminals who damage electrical equipment.

    江苏丰县：
    田间裸铝电线遭洗劫
    去年春季以来，我县25个乡镇的田间裸铝电线被盗多次，几十个村民小组的裸铝电线被洗劫一空。
    我县欢口镇共有36个行政村，去年以来，村村电线被盗，平均每个行政村被盗电线达2000米以上。欢口镇政府驻地欢口村，田间电泵被盗走4个，裸铝电线被盗1.3万多米。这个镇有5个村民小组的电线被盗光。常庄村的田间裸铝线被盗1.5万米后，于今年2月重新架设了新线，但一夜间又被盗走铝线5000多米。
    目前，这类案件在全县范围内不断发生，严重影响农业生产。
    为了防止和杜绝这类案件，我县广大农民要加强看守，搞好安全防范，一旦出现问题，要及时检举揭发。有关部门要严厉打击破坏电力设备的犯罪分子。
