Before that, he served as a submarine commander in the navy. He was arrested for not participating in the military coup that overthrew the civilian government in April 1967.

In 1977, he was elected as a member of the Greek National Parliament for the first time as a member of the New Democracy Party and served as the Minister of Public Works in the New Democracy government in May 1980.

    察奈塔基斯
    以希腊新总理察尼斯·察奈塔基斯为首的临时政府已于2日中午宣誓就职，从而结束了希腊内阁难产的局面。
    察尼斯·察奈塔基斯今年62岁，1927年生于希腊伯罗奔尼撒半岛南端的小镇伊西翁。他在1974年进入政界之前，曾任海军潜水艇艇长。他因未参与1967年4月军人发动的推翻文官政府的军事政变而被逮捕。1973年，他因从事反对军人政权的活动而被迫退役。1974年军政权垮台后，他被任命为希腊全国旅游组织秘书长，为希腊旅游事业的发展作出了重大的贡献。1977年他作为新民主党成员首次被选为希腊全国议会议员，并于1980年5月出任新民主党政府的公共工程部长。1981年和1985年又两次被选入议会。他有一个儿子和一个女儿。
