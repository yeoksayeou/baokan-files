Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 9th.

The cotton production situation in China this year is not optimistic. According to information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, the national cotton planting area is expected to be over 77 million mu this year, a decrease of over 5 million mu compared to last year. The main producing provinces, Shandong and Henan, have reduced their planting areas by 1.35 million mu and 1 million mu, respectively.

This year, the state has twice raised the cotton procurement price and implemented a quota system for cotton exports and imports, which has somewhat restored farmers' enthusiasm for growing cotton. However, due to the low comparative benefits of growing cotton and the unresolved food grain issues in some cotton-producing areas, the new cotton policies have not had a significant stimulative effect on production. Major cotton-producing provinces have seen a significant reduction in cotton planting areas this year. In addition to the reduction in cotton planting areas, the quality of cotton this year is also not ideal. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Shandong Province has seen its pure cotton area decrease from 15 million mu to 13 million mu, with an increase in saline-alkali cotton fields and wheat-cotton interplanting areas. The cotton seedling conditions in Jiangsu, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Shanghai are also poor.

Furthermore, cotton pests and diseases pose a serious threat to cotton production this year. According to the National Plant Protection Station, several major cotton pests and diseases are likely to occur more frequently this year, but currently, there is a general shortage of pesticides.

All these signs indicate that completing this year's cotton production plan will be fraught with difficulties, and the supply-demand contradiction for cotton may further intensify.

    棉花生产形势严峻
    今年种植面积减少五百万亩  供需矛盾有可能进一步加剧
    新华社北京7月9日电（记者蒲立业、李文茹）我国今年的棉花生产形势不容乐观。据农业部提供的情况，今年全国棉花种植面积预计为7700多万亩，比去年减少500多万亩，主产省山东和河南分别减少135万亩和100万亩。
    今年，国家两次提高了棉花收购价格并实行棉花调出调入包干政策，使农民的植棉积极性有所恢复。但由于种棉比较效益过低，部分产棉区口粮问题没有解决，致使新的棉花政策对生产刺激作用不大，主要棉产省今年植棉面积仍然减少较多。除了植棉面积减少较多外，今年的棉花素质也不理想。据农业部介绍，山东省今年纯棉地由1500万亩降为1300万亩，盐碱棉地、麦套棉地相应增多；江苏、湖南、江西、上海等地的棉花苗情较差。
    此外，棉花病虫害也对今年棉花生产构成了严重威胁。据全国植保总站预测，今年几种主要棉花病虫均有可能偏重发生，但目前各地普遍反映农药供应紧张。
    种种迹象表明，完成今年棉花的计划任务困难重重，棉花供需矛盾有可能进一步加剧。
