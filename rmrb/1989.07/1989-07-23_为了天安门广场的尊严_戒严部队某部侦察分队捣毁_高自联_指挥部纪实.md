After Tiananmen Square underwent a special struggle and regained its dignity, the people of the capital and all ethnic groups across the country joyfully thanked the martial law troops for their enduring contributions to restoring its solemn appearance.

We report to our readers the story of a reconnaissance team from a certain unit of the martial law troops, who, in the critical moment concerning the fate of the People's Republic, decisively destroyed the illegal organization "High Autonomy Federation" command center in the early hours of June 4.

Tiananmen Square Issues a Solemn Call

In the early summer of 1989, Tiananmen Square suffered unprecedented hardships since the founding of New China. On May 13, some students from Beijing's universities staged a hunger strike at Tiananmen Square. Afterward, the sacred and solemn Tiananmen Square was filled with makeshift shelters, piles of garbage, and scattered beverage bottles. Spectators were noisy, and various political rumors spread nationwide. What was particularly infuriating was that a group of people actually erected an inappropriate "Goddess of Democracy" statue in Tiananmen Square.

The desecration of Tiananmen Square not only prevented state guests from being received here and prevented millions of children from holding their festive celebrations, but it also became the source of turmoil that spread across the country: China's major artery, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, was blocked, a shopping mall worth hundreds of millions of yuan in Chengdu was burned down, and trains in Shanghai were looted and set on fire...

"Stop the turmoil! Suppress the riot!" "Give us back Tiananmen Square!" This was the voice of the people, the cry of justice!

In the early hours of June 4, the broadcasting station set up by the Beijing Municipal Government at the northeast side of the Great Hall of the People repeatedly broadcast announcements from the Beijing Municipal Government and the martial law troops command, urging young students and onlookers to leave quickly. In the face of our overwhelming force, the onlookers gradually dispersed. However, the "High Autonomy Federation" command center set up at the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes continued to incite through its loudspeakers, and several thousand people still refused to leave around the monument.

At 1:30 AM, the higher-ups issued an order to a certain unit of the martial law troops: dispatch a reconnaissance team to destroy the "High Autonomy Federation" command center!

The commanders of this unit fully understood the honor, difficulty, and great responsibility of this mission. They immediately formed a command group, surveyed the scene, and developed a plan; they decided to send the best company, select the most outstanding soldiers, and form a reconnaissance team to complete this mission.

A special operation was about to begin. 205 soldiers, with their characteristic agility, quickly completed all preparations for departure, awaiting the commander's order. At this moment, the broadcasts of the "High Autonomy Federation" were still incessantly inciting. The soldiers were eagerly waiting.

At 4:25 AM, the reconnaissance team assembled and stood ready. To support the reconnaissance soldiers' actions, the lights in the square were turned off. As soon as the lights went out, the surrounding crowd scattered, and the students began to move towards the monument. The commander immediately gave the order, and 205 soldiers set out from the east gate of the Great Hall of the People...

Reconnaissance Soldiers Display Bravery on Tiananmen Square

At 4:30 AM on June 4, the reconnaissance soldiers suddenly appeared at the east gate of the Great Hall of the People. They bent down, ran swiftly, and quickly approached the "High Autonomy Federation" command center.

The leading Fourth Company, when they reached the sides of the square, was surrounded by the crowd. The commanding junior colonel staff officer Zhao Yongming and the deputy battalion commander Liu Jianjun immediately ordered the Fourth Company to disperse and advance towards the monument, attracting the crowd. Zhao Yongming and Liu Jianjun led the First and Second Companies from the south and north wings of the monument towards the Monument to the People's Heroes. When they saw that the First Company was obstructed and had not yet arrived, they immediately sent people to assist. The four companies closely coordinated and quickly formed a surrounding force around the monument.

At this time, the loudspeakers of the "High Autonomy Federation" command center still occasionally broadcasted the farce of the "48-hour hunger strike" actors and the incitements of the "High Autonomy Federation" leaders, confusing people's minds. Influenced by this, the dispersed crowd regrouped; the few rioters who resisted the clearing prepared a large number of gasoline bottles and barrels, intending to cause an explosion. The area around the Monument to the People's Heroes was still in chaos.

The reconnaissance team of only about 200 people faced thousands of people, making it difficult to disperse the crowd. Any slight mistake could result in being surrounded and "wrapped up." The two commanders, who had experienced the battles of Laoshan, immediately decided to charge directly to the base of the monument and disperse the crowd from top to bottom. Liu Jianjun led 15 soldiers from the First Company from the east side of the monument to quickly form a human ladder, consecutively crossing three layers of marble railings, reaching the top layer of the monument's base. The Second Company, led by Company Commander Wang Qingzhi, also arrived. At that time, the loudspeakers of the "High Autonomy Federation" were still blaring. Liu Jianjun gave the order, and soldiers Sun Tao and Zhu Yueqing aimed and shot, hitting the microphone on the southeast corner of the monument. Soldier Xu Tuanhui also shot, and the loudspeaker on the southwest corner immediately fell silent. Then, the soldiers formed another human ladder and removed the loudspeakers hung on the lampposts. The quick-witted soldier from Jiangsu, Chen Zhijun, saw that the generator on the second layer of the southeast corner of the monument was still running, quickly climbed up, and pulled the wires from the generator, then immediately turned off the switch of another generator.

On the northwest side of the monument, soldiers Wang Kaizheng, Dong Wende, and others from the Fourth Company rushed to the monument, tearing down the slogans and posters stuck on the relief. The soldiers from the Second and Third Companies then rushed into the "High Autonomy Federation" command center, seizing an 861 radio, a tape recorder, 8 loudspeakers, 3 notebooks, and some reactionary leaflets. Then, the soldiers dispersed the crowd from top to bottom.

In just 30 minutes, the "High Autonomy Federation" command center was completely destroyed.

With the permission of the martial law troops, the remaining crowd withdrew to the southeast of Tiananmen Square. The reconnaissance team soldiers began to check the tents with flashlights to ensure no one was left inside, forcibly driving away a group of stubborn individuals who refused to leave.

At 5:30 AM, the lights of Tiananmen Square shone brightly. The various units participating in the clearing gathered at the monument and blocked all entrances to Tiananmen Square. Thus, the solemn Tiananmen Square was once again returned to the people.

The Blue Sky and Earth Bear Witness

Good-hearted people had worried that clearing Tiananmen Square would inevitably result in bloodshed. However, after the reconnaissance team soldiers destroyed the "High Autonomy Federation" command center, people's previous worries proved to be unnecessary. The blue sky and earth bear witness: although our reconnaissance soldiers were armed, they did not fire a single shot at the crowd or students during the clearing of Tiananmen Square.

During the advance towards the "High Autonomy Federation" command center, the reconnaissance soldiers took only a few minutes to reach the fence of the monument. Amidst the noisy and chaotic sounds, the soldiers shouted loudly to the students, with the leading First Company's political instructor Li Xiangwu, who had been awarded a first-class merit citation on the Laoshan frontline, and the Fourth Company's commander Han Quanlan leading the soldiers in repeated shouts: "Please, students and onlookers, quickly move away!" "We are clearing the area, please leave immediately!" "Martial law is legal! Suppressing the riot is legal!" "Please do not attack us, we have the right to self-defense!" Even the usually quiet soldiers were shouting loudly at this moment.

However, some people sitting around the monument did not understand their good intentions. A few people, while cursing loudly, threw stones and beverage bottles at them, hitting their helmets with a loud noise. Soldier Chen Ruiming from the Fourth Company had his left leg cut open.

The soldiers were enraged! Some soldiers retaliated with their rifle butts against the most stubborn individuals resisting the clearing, and some soldiers punched those who threw bricks and bottles. But they never fired a shot at the students or the crowd.

When the reconnaissance team soldiers charged onto the base of the monument, at that moment, an unidentified person rushed over, attempting to seize the rifle from Sergeant Shi Xin. Shi Xin quickly sidestepped and kicked the person, sending him rolling on the ground. The noisy crowd was instantly stunned, and a few people who were rushing up from below, seeing this scene, were frightened and retreated. At this moment, our reconnaissance soldiers fired warning shots into the air and shouted loudly to the crowd, "Everyone, get down! No one is allowed to move or speak!" Under the strong pressure, the students and some of the crowd withdrew, with some begging the soldiers not to hit them. As batch after batch of students and crowd members withdrew, there were still two stubborn individuals who refused to leave. "Kill me, I won't leave, shoot me, shoot here!" they said, pointing to their chests. The soldiers angrily rushed forward, forcibly pulling them down from the monument.

It is particularly worth noting: when the clearing was over, the reconnaissance soldiers seized a cassette tape recording the entire scene. The tape recorded the content of the people's withdrawal from Tiananmen Square before and after, as well as the traitorous calls of the "High Autonomy Federation" leaders to foreign journalists, urging Western countries to "sever diplomatic relations" and "intervene" in China!

When the five-star red flag was raised again at dawn, Tiananmen Square, which had undergone 22 days of hardship, once again opened its arms to embrace our heroic reconnaissance soldiers!

    为了天安门广场的尊严
    ——戒严部队某部侦察分队捣毁“高自联”指挥部纪实
    傅剑仁　冯朗峰　毕永军
    当天安门广场经过一场特殊斗争的洗礼，重展英姿之后，首都群众和全国各族人民都以喜悦的心情，衷心感谢为恢复她的庄严面貌立下了不朽功绩的戒严部队。
    我们向读者报告的，是6月4日凌晨，参加清理天安门广场的戒严部队某部侦察分队，在事关人民共和国前途命运的关键时刻，一举捣毁了非法组织“高自联”指挥部的事迹。
        天安门广场发出了庄严呼唤
    1989年初夏，天安门广场遭受一场新中国成立以来史无前例的痛苦磨难。5月13日，北京部分高校学生静坐天安门广场绝食。这以后，庄严而神圣的天安门广场窝棚林立，垃圾成堆，汽水瓶子遍地，围观群众嘈杂，各种政治谣言四起，波及全国。尤其令人气愤的是，一伙人竟在天安门广场竖起一个不伦不类的“民主女神”雕像。
    天安门广场的被亵渎，不仅使得国宾不能在这里迎送，使得亿万儿童的节日庆典不能在这里举行，而且这里成了波及全国的动乱之源：中国的大动脉京广铁路被阻截，成都价值上亿元的商场被烧毁，上海的列车被抢劫焚烧……
    “制止动乱！平息暴乱！”“还我天安门广场！”这是人民的呼声，这是正义的呐喊！
    6月4日凌晨，北京市设在人民大会堂东北侧的广播站不断播放北京市政府、戒严部队指挥部的通告，劝说青年学生和围观群众迅速离开。在我强大的声势面前，围观者陆续离去。可是，设在人民英雄纪念碑下的“高自联”指挥部，仍然通过其高音喇叭大肆进行煽动，纪念碑四周仍然聚集着几千人不肯离去。
    1时30分，上级给戒严部队某部下达命令：派侦察分队，捣毁“高自联”指挥部！
    这个部队的指挥员们，深知这项任务的光荣、艰巨和责任重大。他们立即组成了指挥组，勘察现场，研究方案；决定派最好的连队，抽最棒的官兵，组成一支侦察分队去完成这项任务。
    一场特殊的行动马上就要开始了。205名官兵以他们特有的敏捷动作，迅速做好了出发前的一切准备，只等首长下命令了。此时，“高自联”的广播还在不停地叫嚣煽动。官兵们在急迫地等待着。
    4时25分，侦察分队集合完毕，整装待发。为配合侦察兵行动，广场熄灯。灯一熄，周围群众四散，大学生开始向纪念碑四周靠拢。部队首长随即一声令下，205名官兵由人民大会堂东大门出发……
    广场上，侦察兵智勇显神威
    6月4日凌晨4时30分，侦察健儿突然出现在人民大会堂东门外广场。他们弯腰弓身，疾步如飞，迅速向“高自联”指挥部逼近。
    率先开路的四连，行至广场两侧时，围观人群蜂拥而上，将官兵团团围住。负责指挥的少校参谋赵勇明和某部副营长刘建军当机立断，命令四连成散开队形向纪念碑推进，把众多的人吸引过来。赵勇明和刘建军分别率领一连、二连，从纪念碑南北两翼向人民英雄纪念碑前进。当他们看到一连受阻尚未到位时，立即派人前去接应。四个连队密切协同，迅速对纪念碑形成了合围之势。
    此时，“高自联”指挥部的高音喇叭仍不时传出“48小时绝食”闹剧扮演者和“高自联”头头蛊惑人心的煽动。受其影响，散去的人员重又聚拢；对抗清场的极少数暴徒，准备了大量汽油瓶和汽油桶，企图制造爆炸事件。人民英雄纪念碑附近仍然处于一片混乱之中。
    仅有200余人的侦察分队面对的是数千之众，要驱散人群是困难的。稍有不慎，还有被分割“包饺子”的危险。经历过老山战斗磨练的两位指挥员，当即决定直插纪念碑的底座，自上而下驱散人群。刘建军带着一连的15名战士从纪念碑的正东方向快速搭起人梯，连续翻越了三层玉石栏杆，到达了纪念碑座的最上层。二连在连长王清志的带领下，也一并到来。当时，“高自联”的喇叭还在哇哇作响，刘建军一声令下，战士孙涛、朱跃青举枪点射，命中了悬挂在纪念碑东南角高处的一个喇叭的蕊头上，战士许团辉又是一个点射，西南角的喇叭也当即作哑。接着，官兵们又搭成人梯，摘除了挂在华灯柱上的几只喇叭。手疾眼快的江苏籍战士陈志军，见纪念碑东南角二层平台上的发电机还在突突发电，几步跨上去，一把拉断了发电机上的导线，又随即关闭了另一台发电机的开关。
    在纪念碑西北侧，四连战士王开政、董文德等人，冲到纪念碑前，将贴在浮雕上的标语、大小字报撕了下来。二连、三连官兵又乘胜冲进“高自联”指挥部，缴获了一部861电台、一台录音机、8台扩音机、3本记录本及部分反动传单等。接着，官兵们自上而下地驱散人群。
    前后30分钟，“高自联”指挥部就被全部捣毁。
    在我戒严部队同意下，滞留的人群向天安门广场东南方向撤走。我侦察分队官兵开始打着手电逐个检查帐篷内是否有人，强行驱赶一伙不肯离去的顽固分子。
    5时30分，天安门广场华灯齐亮。参加清场的各路部队在纪念碑前会合，并封锁了通向天安门广场的各个路口。至此，庄严的天安门广场重又回到了人民手中。
        蓝天和大地作证
    好心的人们曾经担心，清理天安门广场难免流血。然而，当侦察分队的官兵们以捣毁“高自联”指挥部的实际行动作出解释之后，人们曾经有过的担心是多余的。蓝天和大地作证：在清理天安门广场中，虽然我们的侦察兵荷枪实弹，却始终没有向群众和学生开一枪。
    在向“高自联”指挥部的行进中，侦察兵们仅用十几分钟的时间，就接近到了纪念碑的围栏边。在嘈嘈杂杂、闹闹哄哄的烦燥声中，指战员们大声向学生们喊话，冲在前面的侦察一连指导员李相武，曾在老山前线荣立一等功的四连连长韩全兰，领着战士们一遍又一遍地呼喊：“请学生和看热闹的人赶快走开！”“我们要清场了，请你们马上离开！”“戒严合法！平暴合法！”“请不要向我们动武，我们自卫合法！”就连平时不大爱讲话的战士，这会儿都不停地高喊着。
    然而，围坐在纪念碑周围的一些人并没有理解他们的善意。少数人在破口大骂的同时，石块、汽水瓶把他们头上的钢盔打得噼叭作响。四连战士陈瑞明的左腿被划破了一道血口。
  战士们愤怒了！个别战士用枪托还击了对抗清场者中的极端顽固分子，有的战士用拳头回敬了扔砖块、瓶子的人。但他们始终没有向学生和群众开一枪。
    当侦察分队的官兵冲上纪念碑的底座时，这时，一个不明身份的人冲过来，企图夺班长史新的枪。史新见势侧身一让，跟着一脚飞出，将他踢得在地上打了两个滚。嚷嚷吵吵的人群顿时吓傻了，几个从下往上冲的人一见这情景，吓得退了回去。就在这当口，我侦察兵对空鸣枪示警，并厉声向人群喝道“统统趴下！谁也不许乱说乱动！”在强大的压力下，大学生和一些群众撤离了，有的请求战士不要打他们。当一批批大学生和群众陆续撤去的时候，仍有两个执迷不悟的人不肯走开。“打死我也不走，开枪吧，向这里打！”边说边指着自己的胸膛。战士们愤怒地冲上前去，把他们强行拉下了纪念碑。
    这里特别需要补一笔：清场结束时，侦察兵缴获了一盘现场录音带。录音带上录下了天安门广场上的人撤离前后的全部内容，还有“高自联”头目们向外国记者呼吁要西方国家同中国“断交”、向中国“出兵”的卖国叫嚣！
    当五星红旗再次迎着黎明升起的时候，经过22天磨难的天安门广场，再次展开双臂，拥抱了我们英雄的侦察兵！
