An important grain-producing region in China—the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area—has made significant progress in achieving universal primary education. Recently, after inspections and evaluations by the Heilongjiang Provincial People's Government, all 101 state-owned farms in the reclamation area have met the standards for universal primary education.

Since entering the 1980s, the entire reclamation area has allocated 50 million yuan annually from its own funds to develop the education sector. Currently, the total area of primary school buildings in the reclamation area is 678,000 square meters, with an average of nearly 4 square meters of school space per student among the 173,000 primary school students.

To improve teaching quality, the reclamation area has invested in establishing one teacher training college and eight teacher training schools, which can train nearly 2,000 teachers each year. Among the 10,000 primary school teachers in the entire reclamation area, more than two-thirds have a junior college education or higher.
