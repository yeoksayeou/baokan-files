The Emei Mountain Scenic Area in Sichuan is currently undergoing intensive improvement work to present a new appearance to visitors.

The scenic area's key attractions, such as Jinding, Wannian Temple, and Baoguosi, have had 21,800 square meters of unauthorized buildings and excess stalls removed, restoring the original natural landscape. The area's sedan chair teams have been reorganized, and individual stalls have been cleaned up under the "one household, one business, one license" policy. Relevant departments have strictly regulated the routes and parking areas for all vehicles entering the Emei Mountain Scenic Area and implemented unified ticketing and pricing. Garbage that had accumulated for years around the restaurants and hotels at various scenic spots in Emei Mountain has been cleared away, and all drainage ditches have been dredged.
