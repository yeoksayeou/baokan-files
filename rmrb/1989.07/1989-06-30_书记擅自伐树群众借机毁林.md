Last May, the secretary and director of our road management station, Wang Tiecheng, used the excuse that his cousin needed wood for building a house to illegally cut down 80 trees from our station's nursery. These trees had diameters ranging from 10 to 30 centimeters, totaling 5.5 cubic meters of timber.

A few days later, villagers near our nursery began demanding trees. Fearing that the public would report his illegal felling of trees to higher authorities, Wang Tiecheng agreed to some villagers' requests to cut down trees. News spread quickly, and villagers swarmed in, using saws, axes, and knives. Over the course of 7 days, not only were all the mature trees in the nursery stripped bare, but even some young saplings were not spared. A total of 569 trees were cut down, causing the state to suffer losses amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. Afterwards, Wang Tiecheng and some villagers merely symbolically paid a small amount as compensation.

Wang Tiecheng's disregard for the Forestry Law should be investigated by the relevant departments. However, after our station reported Wang Tiecheng's deforestation to higher authorities, the relevant departments have not responded.

    书记擅自伐树群众借机毁林
    去年5月，我公路管理站党支部书记兼站长王铁成，以他表弟盖房需用木料为由，私自砍伐我站苗圃场树木80棵。这些树木直径10至30厘米，共5.5立方米木材。
    几天后，我站苗圃场附近的村民纷纷索要树木，王铁成怕民众向上级反映他滥伐树木的问题，便答应一些村民伐树的要求。消息传出后，村民一拥而上，刀伐、锯拉、斧砍，历时7天，不但苗圃场成材树木被洗劫一空，而且一些幼树也未能幸免，共砍伐树木569棵，给国家造成数万元的损失。事后，王铁成和一些村民只是象征性地交了一点所谓折价款。
    王铁成置森林法于不顾的问题，理应受到有关部门的查处。然而，我站向上级反映了王铁成毁林情况后，有关部门却没有反应。
