Some departments and relevant sides under the State Council have been seriously handling the suggestions made by deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC). As of now, nine units have completed handling all the suggestions assigned to them.

It is understood that during the second session of the Seventh NPC, deputies submitted a total of 3,788 suggestions. By the end of June, 625 of these had been handled and replies sent to the deputies, accounting for approximately 17% of the total.

It is reported that some of the deputies' suggestions have been given attention and adopted by relevant sides. The suggestion made by Deputy Qin Zhixin regarding the handling of economic crime cases has been studied by the Supreme People's Court, which has required all levels of courts, especially court leaders, to strictly enforce the law. All individuals and incidents related to crimes must be thoroughly investigated to uncover the truth, clarify responsibilities, and ensure that justice is served. For cases involving multiple layers of crimes and protective networks, an even more thorough investigation must be conducted to ensure that no criminals escape the law. The suggestion made by Deputy Liu Guangzheng regarding "quickly resolving the investment for pollution control at Benxi Steel" has been coordinated by the General Office of the State Council with relevant departments and commissions. The Ministry of Metallurgy, in consultation with relevant units, has decided to use the method of quality-based pricing for pig iron to resolve the issue, with implementation starting from May 1, 1989.
