	Luwei Village Has a Good Environment for Chicken Farming

	Main Experience: Insist on combining farming and breeding, comprehensively developing rural feed resources, improving socialized services, and conducting moderate-scale operations

	Jiangsu Province Guangyun County Mayor, Wu Jiaqing

	Our county's Dongxin Township Luwei Village has a population of 2,452. Over the past three years, the poultry industry has developed rapidly. Last year, the village had only 20,000 laying hens, which increased to 87,000 last year, and this year it has increased to 112,000. Last year, the village earned 840,000 yuan from poultry farming. Their experience caught my attention, so I conducted an on-site investigation.

	This village started poultry farming with the poultry industry as the guiding direction and adjusted the planting structure. The village's 3,280 mu of arable land increased from 400 mu of corn to 1,080 mu, with all the corn produced used for feed processing. They also mobilized the masses to make full use of local agricultural and sideline products, comprehensively utilizing resources such as collecting shells from rivers, processing feed from previously underutilized bran and bean cakes, and replacing feed elements in various ways. The collective invested in a small feed processing plant, and every household set up a small feed workshop, processing feed according to formulas. Last year, the village produced 4.8 million kilograms of feed, with an average price of 0.28 yuan per kilogram lower than the market supply price. This alone saved 1.3 million yuan in breeding costs per year.

	The village has an average of 1.3 mu of arable land per person, and most households, while cultivating their land well, also have one to one and a half surplus laborers. They chose to raise 300 to 500 chickens per household. Practice has proven that this scale is appropriate, with enough labor to arrange, able to raise chickens well without neglecting other farm work, and both planting and breeding have benefits. Before laying eggs, 6,000 to 7,000 yuan is needed for the cost, which general households can afford. The space is also sufficient. According to scientific breeding requirements, each chicken needs 0.4 square meters of space, and the 1 to 2 fen courtyard of a general household can accommodate it. Last year, 496 households raised chickens on this scale, accounting for 86% of the total number of households. The appropriate scale of chicken farming has obvious benefits, and last year these 496 households had an average income of over 5,000 yuan from chicken farming.

	With the development of the poultry industry, issues such as seedling supply and disease prevention that are difficult for individual households to handle have arisen. To address this, they established a poultry association in March of the previous year. The poultry association helped farmers improve breeds in four ways, introduced 56,000 high-quality chickens last year; published over 400 poultry farming booklets, and trained 413 agricultural technical backbones. Last year, the village's poultry survival rate reached 98%.

	The village's 87,000 laying hens produce about 2 tons of eggs per day. How to handle these eggs? They adopted the method of using the village as a base and radiating outward through two channels. One is for the village poultry association to lead and contact the municipal and county food companies and cake factories to regularly purchase from the village. The other is to attract nearly 100 individual merchants to conduct direct transactions with farmers, who then sell the eggs to nearby markets. In this way, last year the village produced over 500 tons of eggs, all of which entered the market in a timely manner.

	Although Luwei Village's poultry farming has the particularity of small-scale production, their successful experience gives us many beneficial enlightenments.

	First, insisting on combining farming and breeding and conducting moderate-scale operations is an ideal model for the development of rural animal husbandry at this stage. For a long time, in the process of guiding animal husbandry production, we often make mistakes of detaching from reality and blindly pursuing large-scale operations, resulting in either material input not keeping up or management not keeping up, leading to operational failures. Practice has proven that attempting to surpass conditions to choose production and operational scale will only lead to reverse production. At this stage, most rural areas do not have the conditions for large-scale animal husbandry production. The reason why Luwei Village's poultry production can develop steadily and sustainably is that they insist on combining farming and breeding and conduct moderate-scale operations; through locally produced grains, grain-fed poultry, poultry manure, and manure-fed land, they have formed a benign cycle mechanism of farming as the foundation, breeding with farming, and promoting farming with breeding.

	Second, relying on the comprehensive development of rural resources is a realistic way to get rid of the trouble of rising feed prices. Currently, one of the major constraints on the development of animal husbandry is the rise in feed prices. Luwei Village's practice enlightens us that only by relying on the comprehensive development of rural resources, mobilizing a large number of idle social and natural resources, and giving full play to their power, can we fundamentally solve the problem of feed prices. Luwei Village mobilized farmers to produce feed themselves, saving 1.3 million yuan in breeding costs in one year. This shows that rural feed resources have great potential, and as long as they are developed, the benefits are significant.

	Third, matching socialized services are a guarantee for animal husbandry to form moderate-scale operations. From the current situation, in the process of developing animal husbandry production, it is urgent to establish three guarantee systems, namely the technical guarantee system, the market guarantee system, and the price guarantee system. When the supply of poultry and livestock products exceeds demand, it is guaranteed that farmers' products can have a reasonable and stable income. The poultry association established by Luwei Village is such a good form.

    罗圩村养鸡有个好环境
    主要经验：坚持种养结合，综合开发农村饲料资源，搞好社会化服务，进行适度规模经营
    江苏省灌云县县长　吴加庆
    我县东辛乡罗圩村共有2452口人，近3年养鸡业发展较快，前年该村只养蛋鸡2万只，去年猛增到8.7万只，今年又增加到11.2万只；去年全村养鸡获利84万元。他们的经验引起了我的重视，于是实地进行了一番考察。
    这个村开始养鸡就以养鸡业为导向，调整了种植业结构。全村3280亩耕地，由过去的400亩种玉米，增加到1080亩种玉米，所产玉米全部用来加工饲料。他们还发动群众充分利用身边的农副产品资源，大搞综合利用，例如下河捞贝壳，把过去没有很好利用的麸皮、豆饼用来加工饲料等，进行了饲料元素的多种替代。集体投资办起了一个小饲料加工厂，户户建起了饲料小作坊，根据配方，自己加工饲料。去年全村共生产饲料480万公斤，平均每公斤比市场供应价低0.28元。仅此一项，一年节约饲养成本130万元。
    这个村人均耕地1.3亩，全村多数农户在种好田的同时，还要剩余一到一个半劳力的情况，选择了户养300只鸡至500只鸡的规模。实践证明这样的规模适度，劳力够安排，既能养好鸡，又不耽误其他农活，种植和养殖都有收益。产蛋前需要六七千元钱做成本，一般农户拿得起。场地也够使用。按科学饲养需要，每只鸡要占0.4平方米地皮，一般农户家的1至2分庭院地正好容纳得下。去年，全村有496户养这样的规模，占总户数的86％。规模大小适度，养鸡的效益明显，去年这496户，户均养鸡收入5000多元。
    随着养鸡业的发展，种苗供应、疫病防治等一家一户难办的事情提上了日程。为此，他们于前年3月份成立了养鸡协会。养鸡协会去年共帮助农民改良品种4个，引进良种鸡5.6万只；编印养鸡小读物400多册，培训农民技术骨干413人。去年，全村养鸡平均成活率达98％。
    全村8.7万只蛋鸡，一天要产蛋2吨左右，这些鸡蛋怎么处理？他们采取了以村为基地，通过两条渠道向外辐射的办法，就地发育市场。一是由村养鸡协会牵头，与市、县食品公司和蛋糕厂联系，由他们定期到村里收购。二是吸引近百名个体商贩与农户进行直接交易，由他们将鸡蛋拉到附近的市场上出售。这样，去年全村共产鸡蛋500多吨，全部及时进入市场。
    罗圩村养鸡虽然具有小范围生产的特殊性，但他们的成功经验，给我们许多有益的启示。
    一、坚持种养结合，进行适度规模经营是现阶段农村发展养殖业比较理想的模式。长期以来，我们在指导养殖业生产的过程中，经常犯脱离现实条件、盲目追求大规模的错误，结果不是物质投入跟不上，就是经营管理跟不上，使经营失败。实践证明，企图超越条件去选择生产经营规模只能导致生产的逆向运转。在现阶段农村绝大多数地方搞大规模的养殖业生产，条件并不具备。罗圩村养鸡生产之所以能持久稳定发展，就是因为他们坚持种养结合，进行了适度规模经营；通过地产粮、粮养禽、禽积肥、肥养地，形成了种为基础、以种带养、以养促种的良性循环机制。
    二、立足农村资源的综合开发是摆脱饲料涨价困扰的现实途径。当前，养殖业发展面临的一大制约因素是饲料价格上涨，罗圩村的实践给我们的启发是，只有立足农村资源的综合开发，把大量闲置的社会资源和自然资源调动起来，充分发挥其威力，才能从根本上解决饲料价格问题。罗圩村发动农户自己生产饲料，一年就节约饲养成本130万元。这说明，农村的饲料资源潜力很大，只要进行开发，效益是显著的。
    三、配套的社会化服务，是养殖业形成适度规模经营的保证。从目前情况来看，在发展养殖业生产的过程中，迫切需要建立三个保证体系，即技术保证体系，市场保证体系和价格保证体系。在禽畜产品市场供过于求时，保证农民的产品能有合理稳定的收入。罗圩村创办的养鸡协会就是这样一种很好的形式。
