Czechoslovakia Pushes Forward with Nuclear Power Development

According to local newspaper reports, Czechoslovakian Prime Minister Adolf Černý on July 18th inspected the country's first nuclear power plant with a capacity of 1 million kilowatts. He encouraged the workers to make new contributions to the peaceful use of nuclear energy. He said, "Electric power is still the foundation for the further development of the Czechoslovakian economy. To protect the ecological environment, Czechoslovakia is shifting from building traditional thermal power plants to building nuclear power plants."

This nuclear power plant is located near the village of Temelín in the South Bohemian Region of Czechoslovakia. The plant covers an area of 350 hectares, with a total investment of 52 billion koruna (approximately 10 koruna equals 1 dollar). This is Czechoslovakia's largest nuclear power plant. The entire project is scheduled for completion in 1997.
