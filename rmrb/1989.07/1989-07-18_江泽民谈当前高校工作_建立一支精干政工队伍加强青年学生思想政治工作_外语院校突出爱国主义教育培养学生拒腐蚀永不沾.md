Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 18th. (Reporter Chen Nai Jin) CCP Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin, this afternoon, held a discussion with teacher and student representatives from Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute. He pointed out that the situation from the student protests to the turmoil, and then from the turmoil to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, shows that strengthening the Party's leadership, establishing a lean political work team, and strengthening ideological and political work for young students, is a very urgent task for university education. For foreign language universities, it is particularly important to strengthen patriotic education.

Jiang Zemin said, Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute is a school that cultivates tourism and foreign language talents. After graduation, students will all be involved in foreign affairs work. They must have a high degree of patriotism, national pride, and national integrity. They must have lofty ideals, noble sentiments, and a high sense of organizational discipline. Only in this way can they resist corruption and remain untainted in foreign exchanges, and truly serve socialist modernization.

CCP Central Committee Politburo Member and State Education Commission Minister Li Tieying attended today's discussion. In his speech, he demanded that university leaders in the future must clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization and strengthen ideological and political education for young students.

Beijing Second Foreign Language Institute was established in 1964 according to the proposal of Premier Zhou Enlai. During the discussion, teacher and student representatives expressed their opinions on how to strengthen ideological and political work in universities.

State Education Commission Vice Minister Zhu Kaixuan and Minister of the National Tourism Administration Liu Yi attended the discussion.

After the discussion, Jiang Zemin and Li Tieying visited the school library and the audio-visual education center.
