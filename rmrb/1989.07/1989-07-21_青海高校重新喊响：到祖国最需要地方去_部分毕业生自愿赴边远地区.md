	Qinghai universities are once again echoing the call: "Go to where the motherland needs you most!" This slogan, which has not been heard in a long time, recently resonated among the graduating students of Qinghai University and Qinghai Nationalities Teachers College who are facing job assignments.

	In this year's job assignment work, 15 graduating students from the Water Resources, Agriculture, Mechanical Engineering, and Management Engineering departments of Qinghai University have expressed their determination to follow the organization's arrangements and go to work in the places where the motherland needs them most. Forty graduating students (from the Tibetan Language and Literature major) from the first batch of Qinghai Nationalities Teachers College have enthusiastically signed up to work in remote and harsh areas. Currently, they have all received their dispatch certificates.

	The 15 graduating students from Qinghai University wrote in their "Letter of Determination to the School, Department Leaders, and All Teachers": "We are determined to respond to the Party's call, firmly follow the organization's arrangements, go to where the motherland needs us most, to pioneer, to utilize our talents, and to contribute our strength." Two graduating students from Qinghai Nationalities Teachers College, who come from Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, repeatedly requested to go to the harshest conditions in Guoluo Autonomous Prefecture.
