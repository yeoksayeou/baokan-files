Ji Desheng, the director of the Nanyang City Public Notary Office in Henan Province, a member of the Communist Party, and an international notary, has handled over 3,000 domestic and international notarizations since 1982. He has never accepted a single gift from a client, never asked anyone going abroad to buy him anything, and has refused gifts and cash totaling over 3,000 yuan. Over the past few years, Ji Desheng has handled 217 international notarizations involving 16 countries and regions, including the United States, Japan, England, and France. After multiple inspections by higher authorities, no errors or forged documents were found, and the contract fulfillment rate and file qualification rate both reached 100%. Ji Desheng has been named an advanced worker, outstanding Communist Party member, and outstanding notary in Nanyang Region and Nanyang City for seven consecutive years.

Ji Desheng always handles notarizations according to procedures and completes them as quickly as possible, never delaying. The Nanyang City Public Notary Office is the only office in Nanyang Region's 13 counties and cities that handles international notarizations. Ji Desheng never uses this "exclusive business" to hold people up. In May 1985, a woman surnamed Xu from Fangcheng County wanted to go to the United States to settle down and applied for notarization. Her aunt in the United States wrote to her, saying, "Notarization in the United States is very expensive, and if you want to get the notarization certificate quickly, don't be afraid to spend money." She even sent Xu some US dollars for "operating expenses." Xu brought high-grade cigarettes and other gifts to Ji Desheng, asking him to expedite the notarization. Ji Desheng patiently explained to her that Chinese notary offices serve the people and refused her gifts. After investigation and verification, he quickly issued the notarization certificate.

In handling domestic and international notarizations, Ji Desheng adheres to the principle of "following the law, not the person" and never issues "relationship notarizations" or "favor notarizations." Recently, a former medical teacher from Nanyang Medical School who now lives in the United States, Jia, wanted to obtain a notarization certificate proving he had 17 years of acupuncture experience. He went through the Chinese Consulate General in New York to request higher-level leaders to issue a notarization certificate. Ji Desheng, after careful investigation and verification, found that Jia had only 7 years of acupuncture experience and issued a notarization certificate for 7 years of acupuncture experience based on the facts.

In January of this year, the manager of the Nanyang City Materials Bureau Station Supply Station, Wang, owed money to Shenzhen but did not want the notary office to issue a legally binding compulsory execution document. He sought help from various people and even sent gifts and cash to Ji Desheng. Ji refused to accept them, and Wang threw the cash into Ji's courtyard. Ji turned the money over to the relevant authorities and issued the compulsory execution document according to the law.

Over the past eight years, Ji Desheng has refused to issue 28 "relationship notarizations" and "favor notarizations," helping the state, collective, and individuals recover economic losses totaling over 3.6 million yuan. Now, people in Nanyang City affectionately call him "Ji Notary."

    南阳“季公证”
    赵宗礼　李忠
    河南省南阳市公证处主任、共产党员、涉外公证员季德胜，自1982年从事公证工作以来，办理国内外公证3000余件，从未收受过当事人一次馈赠，从未委托出国人员代购一件商品，拒收礼品和现金共3000余元。几年来，季德胜办理的涉外公证217件，涉及美、日、英、法等16个国家和地区，经上级多次检查，未发现一件错证和假证，履约率和卷宗合格率均达100％。季德胜连续7年被评为南阳地区和南阳市先进工作者、优秀共产党员、优秀公证员。
    季德胜对该办的公证总是依照程序，尽快办理，从不推托。南阳市公证处是南阳地区13个县市唯一的办理涉外公证单位，季德胜从不以“独门生意”卡人。1985年5月，方城县一位姓徐的当事人要去美国定居，申请办理公证。她在美国的小姑来信说：“在美国办公证要花很多钱，要想尽快拿到公证书，就不要怕花钱。”还特意给徐某寄来美金作活动费。徐某带着高级香烟等礼品，找到了季德胜，请求尽快办证。季德胜耐心向她说明了我国公证机关是为人民服务的，谢绝了她的礼物。经过调查核实，很快出具了公证书。
    季德胜在办理中外公证中，坚持认法不认人，从不办“关系证”、“人情证”。前不久，定居在美国的原南阳卫校医师贾某，为取得一份能证明他有17年针灸资历的公证书，先后通过我国驻纽约总领事转来上级领导要求出具公证书的批件，季德胜经过认真调查核实，得知贾某只有7年针灸资历，便依据实情只给出具7年针灸资历的公证文书。
    今年元月，南阳市物资局车站供应站经理王某，拖欠深圳货款，却又不想让公证处出具具有法律效力的强制执行文书，他四处找人说情，并给季德胜送礼物和现金，季拒收后，王某把现金扔到季德胜院里，季把这笔钱如数上交到主管部门，并依法出具了强制执行文书。
    8年来，季德胜先后拒办“人情证”、“关系证”28起，为国家、集体和个人挽回经济损失达360多万元。如今南阳市的人亲切称他为“季公证”。
