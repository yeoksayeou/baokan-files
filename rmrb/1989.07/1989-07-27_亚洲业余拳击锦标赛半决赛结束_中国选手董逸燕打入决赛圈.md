The semifinals of the 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championship have concluded. Young Chinese boxer Dong Yiyan has made a new breakthrough in the tournament. In the 91-kilogram weight class, Dong Yiyan used a series of powerful punches to knock down his Indian opponent, Singh, who was half a head taller, in the first round. Dong won by knockout, securing his place in the finals. This is the first time a Chinese boxer has reached the finals in an official international competition.

In tonight's 81-kilogram semifinal, Dong's teammate, 25-year-old Wang Yawei, fought a tough battle against Pakistan's Asghar for nine minutes. Although Wang, who once played a role in the martial arts film "God's Whip," repeatedly pushed his opponent to the ropes and unleashed a barrage of punches, he failed to land enough effective hits and ultimately lost on points.

Tonight saw six weight classes with a total of twelve semifinal matches. The other ten victorious boxers are: Demberel of Mongolia and Han Guangyong of South Korea in the 51-kilogram class; Suninath of Thailand and Lee Hoon of South Korea in the 57-kilogram class; Enkhbat of Mongolia and Kangi of Syria in the 63.5-kilogram class; Dewan of India and Yuk Chang-hyun of South Korea in the 71-kilogram class; Park Se-jong of South Korea in the 81-kilogram class; and Karik of Iraq in the 91-kilogram class.

With the conclusion of the semifinals in all weight classes, the North Korean team stands out as the only team with all its members advancing to the finals.

    亚洲业余拳击锦标赛半决赛结束
    中国选手董逸燕打入决赛圈
    本报北京7月27日讯　记者缪鲁报道：今晚，年轻的中国拳击选手终于不负众望，在第十四届亚洲业余拳击锦标赛上实现了新的突破。正91公斤级的董逸燕用一组漂亮的重拳，在第一回合里便将比自己高出半头的印度拳手辛格击倒在地，从而以不计点胜的战绩，敲开了决赛圈大门。这也是中国拳手首次取得正式国际比赛的决赛权。
    在今晚的81公斤级半决赛中，董的队友、25岁的王亚为与巴基斯坦对手阿斯加苦战三局，打满了九分钟。比赛中，这位曾在武打影片《神鞭》中扮演角色的壮汉虽一次次地把对手逼到圈边，倾下暴雨般的拳点，无奈打中有效部位过少，终以点数告负。
    今晚进行了六个级别的十二场半决赛，其它十位获胜的拳手分别为：51公斤级蒙古的德姆伯尔、南朝鲜的韩光迥；57公斤级泰国的苏尼那友、南朝鲜的李勋；63.5公斤级蒙古的恩克巴特、叙利亚的坎吉；71公斤级印度的德旺、南朝鲜的抑彰铉；以及81公斤级南朝鲜的朴世钟和正91公斤级伊拉克的卡利克。
    至此，本届比赛各级别半决赛均已结束。在此次参赛的选手中，唯有朝鲜队员连战连捷，全部进入决赛。（附图片）
