The three-day enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League concluded today in Beijing. The meeting required all levels of the Youth League organizations to take the serious study and implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee as an important task for the current and future periods. The meeting emphasized the need to unify the thoughts of the entire Youth League with the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, and to further mobilize and organize all members of the Communist Youth League and the broad masses of young people to contribute their strength to the continued advancement of China's reform and modernization.

Song Defu, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, spoke on behalf of the Secretariat at the meeting. His speech was titled "Reviewing the Past, Thinking About the Future, Striving to Complete the Tasks Proposed by the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee." He said that the Youth League organization, facing a complex situation, under the leadership of the Party, has striven to play the role of assistant and bridge, resolutely implementing the important decisions of the Central Committee of the Party and the State Council. With a firm stance and clear banner, it has joined the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the riots. The political direction is correct, the work attitude is active, and it has withstood severe tests.

He said that the Communist Youth League shares the same ideals, beliefs, and political programs with the Communist Party. Being the assistant and reserve force of the Party is the most basic and important political attribute of the Youth League. Therefore, in any situation, it is necessary to maintain a high degree of consistency with the Central Committee of the Party in politics, ideology, and action; in any situation, it is necessary to adhere to the correct method of thinking and always maintain a clear mind to make oneself politically mature as soon as possible; in any situation, it is necessary to strictly abide by the Party's discipline and strengthen Party nature.

Song Defu said that in this turmoil, tens of thousands of young students, starting from participating in the student movement, were later drawn into the turmoil. The development of the situation ultimately went completely against their wishes. The painful reality is shocking. It reveals to us from the opposite side how young people should choose the correct path of growth and how to live up to their times and the Party and people who have nurtured them.

The meeting adopted the "Resolution on Seriously Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee." The resolution believes that at present, it is necessary to strengthen the education of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, guiding young people to have firm political beliefs and adhere to the correct direction. It is necessary to adopt various effective methods to conduct education on patriotism, socialism, independence, self-reliance, hard work, and legal discipline, according to the current ideological state of young people. It is necessary to strengthen the education on the national conditions, with the main content being modern Chinese history, the inevitability of socialism, the current state of economic and cultural development, economic resources and population problems, and the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation. This will inspire patriotic enthusiasm, enhance national self-confidence, and strive to promote the cause of reform and modernization. Liu Yandong, a member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, made a concluding speech at the meeting.

    团中央召开常委扩大会议
    通过关于学习贯彻四中全会精神决议
    引导青年坚定政治信念坚持正确方向
    新华社北京7月16日电　为期3天的共青团中央常委扩大会议今天在北京结束。会议要求各级团组织把认真学习贯彻党的四中全会精神作为当前和今后一个时期的重要任务，用四中全会精神统一全团思想，进一步动员、组织全体共青团员和广大青年，为把我国的改革和现代化建设事业继续推向前进贡献力量。
    共青团中央第一书记宋德福代表书记处在会上作了题为《回顾过去，思考未来，为完成党的十三届四中全会提出的任务努力奋斗》的讲话。他说，共青团组织面对复杂的形势，在党的领导下，努力发挥助手作用和桥梁纽带作用，坚决贯彻党中央、国务院的重要决策，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地投入到制止动乱、平息暴乱的斗争中去，政治方向是正确的，工作态度是积极的，经受住了严峻的考验。
    他说，共青团与共产党有着完全相同的理想、信仰和政治纲领。做党的助手和后备军，是共青团最基本最重要的政治属性。因此，在任何情况下，都必须与党中央在政治上、思想上和行动上保持高度一致；在任何情况下，都应该坚持正确的思维方法，始终保持清醒的头脑，使自己在政治上尽快地成熟起来；在任何情况下，都必须严格遵守党的纪律，加强党性修养。
    宋德福说，在这场风波中，有成千上万的青年学生从参加学潮开始，继而被卷入动乱，事态的发展最终完全走向了他们愿望的反面。惨痛的现实令人触目惊心。它从反面向我们揭示了青年应该如何选择正确的成长道路，怎样才能不负于自己生活的时代，不负于养育自己的党和人民。
    会议通过了《关于认真学习贯彻党的十三届四中全会精神的决议》。决议认为，当前，要特别加强坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化的教育，引导青年坚定政治信念，坚持正确方向。要针对青年的思想现状，采取多种有效方式，进行爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗和法制纪律教育。要加强以中国近代史、社会主义必然性、经济文化发展现状、经济资源和人口问题及中华民族优秀传统为主要内容的国情教育，激发爱国热情，增强民族自信心，努力推进改革和现代化建设事业。团中央书记处书记刘延东在会上作了总结发言。
