When it comes to the "Grass Garden," Beijing's largest Peking Opera ticket office, it is renowned domestically and famous internationally.

Over the past decade, "Grass Garden" has hosted 120,000 Peking Opera enthusiasts from the capital, various provinces and cities across the country, as well as from the United States, Canada, Brazil, France, Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Therefore, it has been praised by Peking Opera lovers both domestically and internationally as a "cultural paradise for theater enthusiasts."

In the spring of 1979, with the strong support of the Dongcheng District Dongxin Bridge Street Office, and through the tireless efforts of various parties, the scattered Peking Opera enthusiasts who performed in open-air venues such as the Temple of Earth Park, the Drum Tower Temple Fair, and the Pingfengli Street Office were organized together. Using the hall in Caoyuan Hutong, Dongxin Bridge, Dongcheng District, as the ticket office, the Dongcheng District Workers' Amateur Peking Opera Troupe was officially established. Since then, every Sunday afternoon, they have held Peking Opera performances without fail, regardless of weather. This mass amateur performance activity has not only attracted numerous Peking Opera enthusiasts but has also drawn many famous Peking Opera performers to come here to "play for fun."

The members of the "Grass Garden" Amateur Peking Opera Troupe are mainly retired and retired workers from Dongcheng District, as well as officials, workers, teachers, doctors, and engineering technicians from various government agencies. They are not only the main performers and accompanists but also the main audience. Each performance, everyone can perform in turn according to the pre-arranged program, without considering the order of names. In addition to Peking Opera arias, they often perform fully costumed shows such as "Four Sons Visiting Their Mother," "Wang Baochuan," "Jade Hall Spring," "Phoenix Returns to the Nest," "Three Mothers Teaching Their Children," "Sitting in the Bandit's Den," and "Lu Cheng Calls for the Gate," among dozens of full-length operas. Even some excellent traditional operas that have not been performed on stage for many years, such as "Battle of Beiyuan," "Wei River," "South Heaven Gate," "Zhao Wumian," "Tianshui Pass," and "Flying Tiger Mountain," are also performed as regular programs. In recent years, "Grass Garden" has also held two unique "private" commemorative performances: one to commemorate the 73rd birthday of the famous Peking Opera performer Qiu Shengjiong, and the other to commemorate the third anniversary of the death of Peking Opera performer Li Wanchun. Both performances featured specialized shows for "painted faces" and "martial roles." These two "private" commemorative performances were not only the first of their kind in Beijing but also in the entire country. Previously, such commemorative activities were mostly organized by the government, but in recent years, for various reasons, the government has stopped organizing them.

    票友之家——草园
    袁静明
    提起“草园”这个北京最大的京剧票房，可谓是闻名于国内，蜚声于海外。
    十年来，“草园”共接待了来自首都和全国各地以及美国、加拿大、巴西、法国、日本、香港、台湾等国家和地区的京剧爱好者有12万人次，因而被国内外京剧爱好者誉为是“戏迷们的文化乐园”。
    1979年春，在东城区北新桥街道办事处的大力支持下，通过各方面的不懈努力，将原先分散在地坛公园、鼓楼庙会、和平里街道等处在露天场所进行弹、拉、说、唱、鼓乐齐鸣的京剧爱好者集中地组织起来，以东城北新桥草园胡同礼堂为票房，正式成立起东城区职工业余京剧队。从此，每星期天下午，他们风雨无阻地在这举办京剧演唱会，十年来从未间断。这种群众性的业余演唱活动，不仅吸引着众多的京剧爱好者，而且一些颇有名气的京剧演员也时常到这里来“玩票”。
    “草园”业余京剧队的成员，基本上是东城区离休、退休职工和在职的机关干部、工人、教师、医生和工程技术人员等，他们既是基本演员、伴奏员，又都是基本观众。每场演出，大家都能按照事先安排好的戏码，不计名次先后轮流演唱，除京剧清唱外，还经常化装演出《四郎探母》、《王宝钏》、《玉堂春》、《凤还巢》、《三娘教子》、《坐寨盗马》、《罗成叫关》等几十出大戏，甚至连一些绝响舞台多年的优秀传统剧目，如《战北原》、《渭水河》、《南天门》、《赵五娘》、《天水关》、《飞虎山》等，也都做为保留节目经常上演。近年来，“草园”还举办了两次别开生面的“民办”纪念性演出活动；一次是纪念著名京剧表演艺术家裘盛戎诞辰73周年，另一次是纪念京剧表演艺术家李万春逝世三周年，分别组织了花脸和武生的专场演出。这两场“民办”的纪念性演出，不但在北京，而且在全国也属于首创。以往这样的纪念性活动多为公办，但近几年出于种种缘故公家停办了。
