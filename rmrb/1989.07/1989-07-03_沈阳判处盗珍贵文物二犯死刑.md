Today, the Shenyang Intermediate People's Court sentenced Liu Jiefei and Zhang Fulin to death for stealing state-owned precious cultural relics and stripped them of their political rights for life.

Liu Jiefei is from Jiamusi, Heilongjiang Province. In 1981, he was detained for 15 days for stealing a motorcycle. In November 1984, he was arrested for theft. Zhang Fulin is from Changli County, Hebei Province, and was detained for theft in 1987. On April 9, 1989, at 21:00, Liu and Zhang, armed with tools, broke into the Liaoning University campus and stole 70 cultural relics from the display case in the second-floor relic storage room. Among these relics were precious items such as a bronze beast-shaped lid with a bird of prey, a dragon-patterned goblet, a bronze plain cup, a female deity statue, a jade sword, and a jade fish. These items were illegally sold in Shanghai and Beijing.

Among these relics, there was 1 national first-class relic, 2 second-class relics, and 42 third-class relics.
