On the eve of the "August 1st" anniversary, local governments and the people across the country actively launched activities to support the military and care for their families, doing good deeds and practical things for the martial law troops and their families.

Since the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have issued notices, requiring active efforts to support the military and care for their families.

Beijing City established a support-the-military office and a coordination group in the suburban districts, involving the Civil Affairs Bureau, the Military Affairs Department, and other relevant departments. They mobilized various departments, enterprises, and the public to do a lot of good deeds and practical things for the martial law troops. The Shijingshan District, learning that the martial law troops stationed there had difficulties with food and accommodation, actively sent 170,000 pounds of vegetables, 360,000 pounds of rice and flour, 10,000 pounds of cooking oil, and more than 1,300 beds. The Xicheng District organized support-the-military service vehicles to supply more than 200 kinds of daily necessities to the troops. The Dongcheng District organized the Department Store to send 3,000 towels and blankets to the martial law troops at Tiananmen Square.

At the same time, various places also solved practical difficulties for the families of martial law troops. In Hebei Province, cities and counties such as Baoding, Xingtai, Zhangjiakou, and Shangyi organized 430 support-the-military service teams to visit and comfort the families of 557 martial law troops door-to-door, and provided household services. The city of Luohe in Henan Province implemented "four priorities" for the families of martial law troops: priority in arranging children for kindergarten, priority in supplying grain, oil, and sideline products, priority in employment, and priority in housing allocation. Additionally, 7,000 pounds of white flour were supplied free of charge.
