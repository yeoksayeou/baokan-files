While many students are struggling under the weight of heavy school bags, the children of the "Little Azalea" art troupe at the affiliated primary school of Nanchang Normal School are developing comprehensively in terms of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and aesthetics.

The troupe has over eighty members. In its twenty-one years of existence, it has created and performed over two hundred programs. In recent years, a number of its dance, choir, and solo performances have won excellent awards in provincial, municipal, and national competitions. In 1987, some of the troupe members even performed at the Great Hall of the People for central leaders. The Yugoslavian television station also recorded a two-hour-long performance by the Little Azalea Art Troupe and broadcast it in their country.

    小杜鹃艺术团寓教于乐
    新华社南昌七月十三日电　（记者卢晶）当许多小学生被“沉重的书包”压得喘不过气的时候，南昌师范学校附属小学“小杜鹃”艺术团的孩子们，却在德、智、体、美全面发展。
    这个小艺术团有八十多人。建团二十一年，自编、自演了二百多个节目。近年来，有一批舞蹈及合唱、独唱节目获得省、市及全国比赛的优秀奖。一九八七年，部分队员还进了怀仁堂为中央领导同志演出。南斯拉夫电视台还专门录制了小艺术团演出的一台长达二小时的节目向本国播放。
