Xinhua News Agency, Paris, July 9th.

Prince Sihanouk said today in Paris that he has come to France with "good intentions" to promote the success of the international conference on the Cambodian issue scheduled to be held in Paris at the end of July.

Prince Sihanouk arrived in Paris today. He said that if things go smoothly, the conference will be successful. However, he believes that it will require some feasible concessions from the relevant parties.

When discussing the issue of establishing an international supervision mechanism in Cambodia, Sihanouk said that whether this issue should be decided by this Paris conference or by the United Nations General Assembly can be resolved through negotiations.

Sihanouk will first hold talks with Hun Sen, the Prime Minister of the Phnom Penh government, on July 24, and then meet with the leaders of the other two factions of the Cambodian resistance movement, Khieu Samphan and Son Sann.

    为柬问题国际会议作准备
    西哈努克抵巴黎
    新华社巴黎7月9日电  西哈努克亲王今天在巴黎说，他此次是“怀着良好的愿望”，为促进7月底在巴黎召开的柬埔寨问题国际会议获得成功而来到法国的。
    西哈努克亲王是今天抵达巴黎的。他说，如果事情进展顺利的话，会议将会取得成功。但他认为必须以有关方面作出一些可行的让步为代价。
    在谈到在柬埔寨建立国际监督机制问题时，西哈努克说，这个问题是应由这次巴黎会议来决定，还是由联合国大会来决定，可以谈判解决。
    西哈努克将在7月24日先同金边政权总理洪森举行会谈，然后将会见柬抵抗运动另外两派的领导人乔森潘和宋双。
