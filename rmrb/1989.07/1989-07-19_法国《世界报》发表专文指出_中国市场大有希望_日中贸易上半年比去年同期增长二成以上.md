	French "Le Monde" Publishes Article Stating That the Chinese Market Holds Great Promise
	Japan-China Trade in the First Half of the Year Grew by More Than 20 Percent Compared to the Same Period Last Year

	People's Daily, Paris, July 19 (Reporter Zhang Qihua) Today, "Le Monde" published an article titled "China Remains a Market" which points out that French businessmen's strategy is to continue cooperating with China and there is no question of abandoning ongoing negotiations.

	The article lists several major contracts between France and China in recent years in the fields of power plants, communications, automobiles, and aircraft. It points out that after the events in China in May, French businessmen still consider China a market full of hope. After a short period of waiting and observation, most French businessmen have returned to China. Their negotiations with China are proceeding smoothly, and some are even preparing new projects. French businessmen have not changed their investment plans in China, and there have been no changes in the implementation of contracts.

	When discussing economic sanctions, the article says that the French government's adoption of "retaliatory measures" against China, announcing the freezing of already signed payment agreements, has seriously affected the activities of some businessmen in China. Four major businessmen have jointly protested the government's decision. The article also believes that in the context of international competition for markets, the government's actions have made it more difficult for businessmen to work in the hard-won Chinese market.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 18 According to statistics recently released by Japan's Ministry of Finance, from January to June 1989, the total value of Japan-China import and export trade reached $9.777 billion, an increase of more than 20 percent compared to the same period last year.

	Statistics show that in the first half of this year, Japan's exports to China amounted to approximately $4.608 billion, and imports amounted to approximately $5.170 billion, an increase of 12.7 percent and 12.6 percent respectively compared to the same period last year.

	According to statistics, compared to the same period last year, Japan's exports of motorcycles to China in the first half of this year increased by six times, and televisions and home video recorders increased by more than two times. China's exports of semiconductors and other electronic components to Japan increased by more than eight times, audio-visual equipment increased by more than three times, and machinery and instrument equipment increased by 2.7 times.

    法国《世界报》发表专文指出
    中国市场大有希望
    日中贸易上半年比去年同期增长二成以上
    本报巴黎7月19日电  记者张启华报道：今天《世界报》发表题为《中国依然是一个市场》的专文指出，法国企业家的战略是继续同中国合作，不存在放弃正在进行的谈判问题。
    文章列举了近几年来法中在电站、通信、汽车、飞机等几项大合同后指出，在中国5月事态后，法国企业家们依然认为中国是个大有希望的市场。经过一段短时间的等待、观望，绝大部分法国商人都已返回中国，他们同中国正在进行的谈判很顺利，有人还准备上新的项目。法国企业家至今没有改变在中国的投资计划，在合同的实施方面也没有变动。
    文章在谈到经济制裁时说，法国政府对中国采取“报复措施”，宣布冻结已经签订的货款协议，严重影响了某些企业家在中国的活动。已有4名大企业家联名抗议政府的决定。文章还认为，在国际争夺市场的背景下，政府的做法使企业家们对得之不易的中国市场的工作更加困难了。
