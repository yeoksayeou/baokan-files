The Cambodian four-party round-table conference was held this morning at the Château de la Celle-Saint-Cloud, west of Paris. Prince Sihanouk, Son Sann, Khieu Samphan, Hun Sen, and their advisors attended the meeting, representing the three resistance factions and the Phnom Penh government, respectively.

French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas presided over the opening ceremony this morning. He stated in his speech that for nearly 20 years, Cambodia has been in a state of disintegration, and foreign military invasions have plunged it into a war. He hoped that through the efforts of all parties, peace could be restored in Cambodia and brotherly affection could be rekindled. After the opening ceremony, Prince Sihanouk took over the chairmanship of the meeting.

This Cambodian four-party round-table conference is a preparatory meeting for the upcoming international conference on the Cambodian issue to be held in Paris in a few days, and it is expected to last for two days.

In November 1988, at a conference held in Villeroy, east of Paris, it was decided to establish a four-party working committee. However, due to difficulties encountered, the committee's work has barely progressed. This time, it is the first time that the four-party leaders of Cambodia have formally sat down together to discuss the Cambodian issue.

The two-day Cambodian four-party round-table conference ended in disagreement after a day of discussions due to the difficulty in reconciling the positions of the three resistance factions and Hun Sen.

This afternoon, after the meeting, Prince Sihanouk briefed the press on the relevant situation. He said that the resistance factions and Hun Sen have differing views on the supervision of the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops and the dispatch of international peacekeeping forces to Cambodia. He accused that after the withdrawal of the regular Vietnamese troops, there are still 130,000 Vietnamese troops remaining in the Phnom Penh government's army and militia. On the ceasefire issue, he emphasized that without a comprehensive supervision agreement, a ceasefire is impossible. On the composition of the delegation to attend the Paris international conference, he proposed that the four parties form a unified delegation named "Cambodia," but Hun Sen expressed opposition.

Prince Sihanouk expressed that he is more pessimistic about the comprehensive resolution of the Cambodian issue. He announced the end of this round-table conference, stating that the scheduled meeting for tomorrow will not be held.

On July 24th, Prince Sihanouk of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front met with Hun Sen at the Château de la Celle-Saint-Cloud, west of Paris, after which he met with the press. On the eve of the international conference on the Cambodian issue scheduled for July 30th, the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea and the Vietnamese-backed puppet government of Cambodia began a series of talks.

    民柬三方与洪森立场难以接近
    柬四方会议不欢而散
    本报巴黎7月25日电　柬埔寨四方圆桌会议今日上午在巴黎西部拉塞勒—圣克卢镇城堡举行。西哈努克、宋双、乔森潘、洪森以及他们的顾问分别代表抵抗运动三方和金边政权参加了会议。
    法国外长迪马主持了今日上午的会议开幕式。他在致词中说，近20年来，柬埔寨处于四分五裂之中，外国军队的入侵使她陷入了一场战争。他希望通过各方的努力在柬埔寨重新实现和平和恢复兄弟间的情谊。开幕式后，会议由西哈努克主持。
    这次柬埔寨四方圆桌会议是为几天后在巴黎举行的柬埔寨问题国际会议作准备的，预计举行两天。
    1988年11月，在巴黎东部弗尔昂塔德努瓦镇举行的柬埔寨会议上决定成立四方工作委员会。但之后，由于遇到困难，委员会的工作基本未开展。此次，是柬埔寨四方领导人第一次正式坐在一起讨论柬埔寨问题。

  （记者茅瑞清、沈孝泉）预期两天的柬埔寨4方圆桌会议经过今天一天的讨论，由于抵抗运动3方与洪森之间的立场难以接近，以不欢而散告终。
    今天下午，西哈努克亲王在会议结束后向记者介绍了会议的有关情况。他说，抵抗运动和洪森在监督越南撤军和向柬派遣国际维持和平部队的问题上有分歧，他指责在越南撤出正规部队后还有13万越南军人留在金边政权的部队和民兵中。在停火问题上，他强调，没有一个全面的监督协议就不可能停火。在出席巴黎国际会议代表团的组成问题上，他建议4方组成一个统一的以“柬埔寨”为名称的代表团，但洪森表示反对。
    西哈努克表示，他对全面解决柬埔寨问题更加悲观了。他宣布这次圆桌会议到此结束，预期在明天的会议不再举行。（附图片）
