The earliest fans used by the ancient Greeks were made from dyed reeds. During the Roman Empire, fans were crafted from ostrich feathers. Around the 5th century BC, Egyptian noblewomen used fans made of peacock feathers, with gold handles. King Louis XV of France was particularly fond of carrying fans, and this trend quickly spread throughout the country. During the reign of King Charles II of England, the court fashion mimicked that of France, and people of all ages carried fans. In the 18th century, the French court hired skilled artisans from China to specially craft ivory and pearl folding fans. For the Japanese, fans hold significant meaning. When a child comes of age, they receive a fan as a gift. Fans are essential items in certain Shinto rituals and poetry competitions, and guests attending weddings must bring fans. Geishas performing traditional dances also rely on them. However, the three folding fans used in the tea ceremony are for placing sweets and are not meant for fanning. Interestingly, in countries like Spain, women can express their feelings with fans: placing the fan on the hand and flipping it over means "you are annoying"; holding the fan to half-cover the face means "do you like me?"; placing the fan near the cheek means "I love you"; opening and closing the fan repeatedly means "I miss you very much"; folding the fan shut means "you are not worth loving"; throwing the fan on the table means "I do not like you"; if a woman fans herself quickly with her right hand, it means "leave me quickly." Men, on the other hand, hope that women will open their fans and prop up their chins, as this means: "I hope to see you again soon."

    洋扇闲聊
    古希腊人最早的扇子用染色的芦苇编制。罗马帝国时期，扇子是用鸵鸟羽毛编制的。公元前五世纪左右，古埃及贵妇人使用的扇子是孔雀毛做的，扇柄是纯金制成的。法国路易十五特别喜欢佩带扇子，上行下效，男子使用扇子很快风靡全国。英国查尔斯二世时期，宫廷风俗模仿法国，男女老少都带扇子。十八世纪时，法国宫廷从中国聘请了能工巧匠专门加工象牙和珍珠贝折扇。对日本人来说，扇子还具有生命开始的意义，小孩成年时得到的礼物是扇子，扇子是某些神道仪式中不可缺少的道具和赛诗会上的奖品，参加婚礼的宾客都必须携带扇子，艺妓表演传统舞蹈更离不开它。但茶道用的三根折扇是放点心待客的，不能用来扇风。有趣的是，西班牙等国妇女能用扇子说出自己的心里话：她们把扇子放在手上翻来翻去，那是说“你令人讨厌”；手执扇子半遮面，那是问你“喜欢我吗？”将扇子贴近脸颊，那是“我爱你”的意思；把扇子开了合合了开，那是说“我非常想念你”；把扇子收折起来，那是说“你这个人不值得一爱”；把扇子掷在桌上，等于说“我不喜欢你”；如果用右手快速扇扇子，那就是说“你赶快离开我”。男子们都希望妇女打开扇子支着下颌，因为这是在说：“我希望下次同你早点见面”。		（7月4日《农民日报》甘士杰文）
