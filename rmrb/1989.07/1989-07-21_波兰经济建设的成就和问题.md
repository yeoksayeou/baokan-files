July 22 marks the 45th anniversary of the founding of the Polish People's Republic. Over nearly half a century, this beautiful and fertile Eastern European country has undergone tremendous changes.

Before the war, Poland was known as an agrarian-industrial country, but its agricultural production level was low, and its industrial foundation was weak. At that time, the per capita industrial and agricultural output of Western European countries was 7 to 9 times higher than that of Poland, so Poland was also known as the "sick man of Europe" in economic terms.

After the war, under the leadership of the people's government, Poland's industrial development surged, and agricultural production steadily increased. Over the past 45 years, Poland's steel production has increased by 13 times, while electricity, coal, fertilizer, synthetic fibers, tractors, and passenger cars have increased by 23 times, 4 times, 34 times, 31 times, 13 times, and 153 times, respectively. The harvest of four types of grains, including wheat, increased from 50.7 million tons in the early days of liberation to 245 million tons in 1988. The number of livestock such as cattle, pigs, and sheep has also increased by an average of 4.3 times. Today, Poland has become a moderately developed industrial-agricultural country. Poland ranks among the top in Europe in the production of sulfur, hard coal, silver, rye, and potatoes. In terms of per capita production, Poland ranks first in Europe in brown coal, sulfur, rye, and potatoes.

With the continuous development of production, the living standards of the Polish people have rapidly improved. The most obvious example of this is the improvement in housing conditions for residents. During World War II, 60% of the houses in Polish cities and towns were destroyed. After large-scale repairs and construction, the per capita living space in Poland has now reached 14.2 square meters, basically achieving the standard of one room per person. Another fact is the increase in residents' income. Although Poland's prices have fluctuated from time to time, overall, workers' wages have increased. Urban and rural residents generally have savings. In addition, after the war, the dietary structure of the Polish people has greatly improved, with per capita meat consumption nearly tripling.

The achievements in construction and the improvement in living standards are inseparable from the high spirits and diligent efforts of the Polish people. In the early days of the establishment of the people's regime, the Polish party and government put forward the slogan of "rebuilding the homeland from the ruins of war," mobilizing the masses to work selflessly and completing the three-year economic recovery plan ahead of schedule. From 1947 to 1949, Poland's industrial output value increased by an average of 20% per year, and national income increased by an average of 21% per year. This astonishing rate of development was praised by the world as the "Warsaw speed." In addition, people still remember the thriving economic scene of Poland in the 1970s. At that time, the Polish United Workers' Party proposed a policy of "opening up to the outside world and borrowing heavily," attempting to achieve a "high-speed economic development strategy" through this policy. This policy had some effect in the first half of the 1970s. Poland introduced more than 4,000 projects from the West, built more than 400 large modern factories, and also updated the technical equipment of a large number of factories, thus laying a solid material foundation for the modernization of industry and agriculture and shortening the gap with the world's advanced industrial countries that had formed due to the slow economic development of Poland in the 1950s and 1960s. By the end of the 1970s, Poland had once been ranked as the world's tenth-largest industrial country in terms of total industrial output.

However, Poland's economic construction has not been smooth sailing. Over the past 45 years, Poland has had both brilliant achievements and serious problems in economic construction. The leader of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jaruzelski, believes that these problems exist "due to mistakes in economic policy and flaws in the economic system," which are the "subjective and objective reasons" for the existence of these problems. First, Poland emphasized heavy industry in economic construction, neglecting light industry and agriculture. This policy mistake led to an imbalance in economic development and a sustained shortage of market supply. Second, excessive borrowing and misuse. This mistake caused Poland to fall into a deepening vortex of foreign debt. Poland's debt to Western countries has increased from $9 billion in 1970 to $39.2 billion in 1988. Foreign debt has become an important factor hindering Poland's economic development. Third, advocating "high wages" and promoting "high consumption." For a long time, especially since the 1970s, wage increases have exceeded the growth of production, labor productivity, and market commodity supply, and the level of consumption has been higher than the level of production. This distorted phenomenon has led to an imbalance between social total demand and total supply, and between the amount of money in circulation and the supply of market commodities. In addition, the practice of Poland's economic construction over the past half-century has also exposed the contradiction between the development of productive forces and the imitation of the old Soviet economic management system.

To make economic construction move towards a healthy development path, the Polish authorities began to adjust the economy in early 1982 and started to promote economic reforms nationwide. Poland's economic reform is carried out in two stages: the first stage (1982-1987) implements the principle of "three autonomies" (enterprise autonomy, self-government, and self-profit) in enterprise management reform and national institutional reform; the second stage (starting in 1988) expands the scope of the reform and implements a comprehensive set of reforms related to prices, wages, market, finance, and taxation.

The first few years of Poland's economic reform progressed smoothly and achieved significant results. However, in recent years, it has been difficult. Polish economists believe that the price increases, inflation, and the coexistence of new and old systems that have emerged during the reform process have "posed difficulties for economic reform" and also "affected the broad masses' ability to bear." However, they expressed their belief that with the deepening of economic reform, these temporary phenomena "will disappear on their own."

Economic reform is the aspiration of the Polish people today. They not only hope to get the country out of the current economic predicament and avoid social unrest through reform, but also hope that the reform will open up a broad development path for Poland's socialist economic construction.

    波兰经济建设的成就和问题
    汤德乔
    今年7月22日是波兰人民共和国成立45周年纪念日。在将近半个世纪的岁月里，这个美丽富饶的东欧国家的面貌发生了巨大的变化。
    战前，波兰号称农业—工业国，但农业生产水平很低，工业基础薄弱。当时，西欧各国人均工农业产值比波兰高7—9倍，因此，波兰在经济上又有“欧洲病夫”之称。
    战后，在人民政府领导下，波兰工业发展突飞猛进，农业生产也稳步上升。45年来，波兰钢产量增加了13倍，电力、煤、化肥、化纤、拖拉机和小轿车产量则分别增长23倍、4倍、34倍、31倍、13倍和153倍。小麦等四种谷物收获量从解放初期的507万吨增加到1988年的2450万吨。牛、猪、羊等牲畜存栏数也平均增长4.3倍。如今，波兰已成为中等发达的工业—农业国。波兰在硫磺、硬煤、银、黑麦和土豆生产方面名列欧洲前茅。褐煤、硫磺、黑麦和土豆按人均产量计，波兰则位居欧洲首位。
    随着生产不断发展，波兰人民的生活水平迅速提高。在这方面最为明显的例子是居民住房条件的改善。在第二次世界大战中，波兰城乡60％房屋被毁。经过大规模修复和兴建，现在波兰人均住房面积已达14.2平方米，基本上已实现一人一间房的标准。另一个事实是居民收入增加。尽管波兰物价时有波动，但总的说来，职工工资都有增加。城乡居民普遍有储蓄。此外，战后，波兰人的膳食结构大为改进，人均食肉量几乎增长了3倍。
    建设的成就和生活的提高是与波兰人民的高涨劳动热情和奋发图强精神分不开的。人民政权成立初期，波兰党和政府提出“在战争废墟上重建家园”的口号，动员群众忘我劳动，提前完成了恢复经济的三年计划。1947—1949年期间，波兰工业产值每年平均增长20％，国民收入每年平均增长21％。这种惊人的发展速度被世人誉为“华沙速度”。另外，人们还记得70年代波兰经济呈现的蓬勃发展景象。当时，波兰统一工人党提出了一项“对外开放，大举外债”的政策，试图通过这一政策实现“高速度经济发展战略”。这一政策在70年代上半期曾收到一定的效果。波兰从西方引进4000多个项目，兴建400多个大型现代化工厂，还更新了一大批工厂的技术设备，从而为工农业现代化打下了雄厚的物质基础，缩短了波兰由于五六十年代经济发展缓慢而与世界先进工业国家之间形成的差距。70年代末，按照工业总产值计算，波兰曾一度作为世界第十大工业国。
    然而，波兰经济建设并不是一帆风顺的。45年来，波兰在经济建设中既有辉煌的成就，也有严重的问题。波兰统一工人党领导人雅鲁泽尔斯基认为，这些问题的存在“与经济政策的失误和经济体制的弊端有关”，两者是问题存在的“主客观原因”。首先，波兰在经济建设中强调重工业，忽视轻工业和农业。这一政策上的失误导致经济发展比例失调，市场供应持续紧张。其次，举债过多，使用不当。这一失误使波兰陷入不断加深的外债漩涡之中。波兰欠西方国家的债务已从1970年的9亿美元猛增到1988年的392亿美元。外债成了妨碍波兰经济发展的重要因素。第三，提倡“高工资”，宣传“高消费”。长期以来，特别是70年代以来，工资增长超过生产、劳动生产率和市场商品供应的增长，消费水平高于生产水平。这种扭曲现象导致社会总需求与总供给、货币流通量与市场商品供应量之间的不平衡。除此以外，近半个世纪以来的波兰经济建设实践也暴露了生产力发展与抄袭苏联旧的经济管理体制之间的矛盾。
    为了使经济建设走上健康发展的道路，波兰当局于1982年初着手调整经济，并开始在全国推行经济改革。波兰经济改革分两个阶段进行：第一阶段（1982—1987年）实现“三自”（企业自主、自治和自负盈亏）原则的企业管理改革和国家机构体制改革；第二阶段（1988年起）扩大改革范围，实行有关物价、工资、市场、金融、税收改革的综合性配套改革。
    波兰经济改革头几年进展顺利，成效明显。但近年来步履艰难。波兰经济学家们认为，改革过程中出现的物价上涨、通货膨胀和新旧体制并存现象“给经济改革出了难题”，也“影响了广大人民的承受能力”。但是，他们表示相信，随着经济改革的深化，这些暂时的现象“会自行消失”。
    经济改革是当今波兰人心所向。他们不仅希望通过改革使国家摆脱当前经济困境，避免社会动荡，而且希望改革为波兰社会主义经济建设开辟广阔的发展道路。
