Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 9th.

The amount of funds that state-owned industrial enterprises in China can independently manage has reached approximately 10 billion yuan last year. This fact shows that the vitality of state-owned industrial enterprises has significantly increased during the reform.

Currently, the funds that enterprises can independently manage mainly include three aspects: first, retained profits, second, loans repaid from pre-tax profits, and third, various special funds set aside by enterprises. According to statistics, last year, the funds for enterprise retained profits and pre-tax loan repayments reached 5.24 billion yuan. State-owned industrial enterprises possessing such a large amount of independently managed funds is a welcome result of the healthy development of the national economy.

Economic experts analyze that the reason state-owned industrial enterprises possess such a large amount of funds is due to the rapid development of enterprise production and the significant increase in profits and taxes created in recent years. In the 10 years of reform, China's industrial development has achieved remarkable results that have attracted worldwide attention. Not to mention the doubling of production value, just looking at the profits and taxes created, 1988 saw a 20.8% increase over the previous year, and a doubling compared to the pre-reform year of 1978. In the past 10 years, more than 70% of the national fiscal revenue has been provided by industrial enterprises. This indicates that the growth of industrial enterprises' independent financial power is based on the solid foundation of rapid production development.

Before the reform, state-owned industrial enterprises had very little financial flexibility and had to follow the instructions of the relevant government departments for every move, lacking any vitality. With the deepening of the reform, the financial flexibility of enterprises has been increasing. Just in terms of retained profits, the cumulative amount over 10 years has reached nearly 20 billion yuan. Enterprises now have the right to operate and the ability to rely on their own strength to carry out construction and technological transformation, resulting in significant changes. Many enterprises are no longer mere pawns in the government's hands but have become independent economic entities with the right to make their own decisions; they are no longer appendages of government departments but independent legal entities.

Financial department officials remind enterprise leaders: now that enterprises possess such a large amount of independently managed funds, it is time to create more benefits and make more contributions to the country. They point out two issues that enterprises should deeply consider and seriously address: first, how to ensure that the contract system truly covers both profits and losses. Currently, the situation is that enterprises that complete the contract targets and have surplus income receive the full amount of the surplus from the financial department; however, enterprises that do not complete the contract targets mostly do not use their own funds to make up the shortfall. Second, how to ensure the reasonable growth of national fiscal revenue. Currently, the situation is that enterprise retained profits have increased significantly, while the profits turned over to the state have actually decreased. There may be many reasons for this situation, but correctly handling the distribution of interests among the state, enterprises, and individuals, and ensuring the reasonable growth of national fiscal revenue, should be the responsibility that all industrial enterprises cannot shirk.

    国营工业企业在改革中活力大增  自主支配财力去年约达一千亿元
    新华社北京7月9日电（记者齐文）我国国营工业企业可以自主支配的财力有多少？据权威人士新近透露，去年约达1000多亿元。这个事实表明，在改革中我国国营工业企业的活力已大大增强。
    目前，企业可以自主支配的财力主要包括3个方面：一是利润留成，二是纳税前利用利润归还的贷款，三是企业提取的各种专项基金。据统计，去年企业留利和税前还贷的资金达524亿元。国营工业企业拥有这么大的自主支配财力，是国民经济健康发展的一个可喜成果。
    经济界人士分析认为，国营工业企业拥有这么大的财力是近些年企业生产迅速发展，所创利税大幅度增长的结果。在改革的10年中，我国工业发展取得了举世瞩目的成就。且不说产值的翻番，仅就所创利税来看，1988年比上年增长20.8％，比改革前的1978年增长了一倍。近10年来，国家财政收入中的70％多是由工业企业提供的。这表明，工业企业自主财力的增长是建立在生产大发展的坚实基础上的。
    改革之前，国营工业企业的机动财力微乎其微，一举一动都得听命于主管的政府部门，谈不上有什么活力。随着改革的深入，企业的机动财力不断增多，仅留利一项，10年累计就达近2000亿元。企业有了经营权，有了依靠自己力量搞基建、搞技术改造的能力，面貌有了很大变化。不少企业不再是拨一拨、动一动的算盘珠，而是有自主权的经济实体；不再是政府部门的附属物，而是可以自决行动的独立法人。
    财政部门的同志提醒企业负责人：企业拥有了这么大的自主财力，现在已经到了多出效益、多为国家做贡献的时候了。他们指出两点值得企业深思和认真解决：一是如何使承包真正做到既包盈又包亏。现在的情况是，完成承包目标并有超收的企业，财政部门如数兑现超目标所得；而未完成承包目标的企业，大部分没有做到用企业自有资金补齐上交。二是如何确保国家财政收入的合理增长。目前的情况是企业留利大幅度增长，而上交利润却反而下降。造成这种情况原因可能很多，但正确处理国家、企业、个人三者利益的分配关系，保证国家财政收入的合理增长，应是全体工业企业义不容辞的责任。
