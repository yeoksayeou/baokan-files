The Interior Minister of Chile, Caserés, announced on the 26th that the current Chilean President Pinochet will not be nominated as a presidential candidate for the election to be held in December this year.

Pinochet had previously stated that if the people "demand" that he run as the next presidential candidate, he would "possibly accept." Pinochet's attempt to seek re-election has been criticized by the opposition parties.

In a televised address to the nation, Caserés said that the Chilean military has expressed its respect for this election and has promised not to interfere with the election by force.

It is reported that the presidential candidate of the ruling party of Chile, former Finance Minister Hernán Büchi, officially registered on the 27th. Before this, 17 major opposition parties in Chile had already nominated the leader of the Christian Democratic Party, Aylwin, as the sole presidential candidate for the national opposition parties.

    新华社圣地亚哥7月27日电　智利内政部长卡塞雷斯26日晚宣布，智利现任总统皮诺切特将不被提名为总统候选人参加今年12月举行的大选。
    皮诺切特曾表示，“如果人民要求”他作为下届总统候选人，他将“可能接受”。皮诺切特谋求连任的企图遭到反对党指责。
    卡塞雷斯在对全国发表的电视讲话中说，智利军方表示将尊重这次大选，并许诺不会用武力干预选举。
    据悉，智利执政党总统候选人、前财政部长埃尔南·布奇已于27日正式注册。在此之前，智利17个主要反对党已推举基督教民主党领袖艾尔文为全国反对党唯一总统候选人。
