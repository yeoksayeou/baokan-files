The Argentine government signed an agreement on July 17 with the country's 300 most important business leaders to freeze the prices of consumer necessities for 90 days.

According to the agreement, business leaders will adhere to the current price policy since July 15, ensuring the normal supply of daily necessities for the next three months. In exchange, the government will not adjust the exchange rate and interest rate range, and will not impose additional taxes on public service projects.

Economy Minister Lapanei stated after the signing of the agreement, "The best way to maintain wage purchasing power is to ensure price stability," and added that this agreement is just the "first step" towards the social contract proposed by President Menem.

It is believed that this is another important measure taken by Menem since he took office as Argentina's president on July 8 to address the country's severe economic difficulties.

    阿根廷政府与企业签约
    决定冻结物价90天
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯7月17日电　阿根廷政府17日同国内最重要的300名企业家签署了一项“冻结”消费必需品价格90天的协议。
    根据协议，企业界领导人接受自7月15日以来的现行价格政策，保证在今后3个月内生活必需品的正常供应。作为交换条件，政府方面则不再变动兑换率和利率幅度，不对公共服务项目增加征税。
    经济部长拉帕内利在协议签署后指出，“维护工资购买力的最好方式是保证价格的稳定”，并说这项协议仅仅是朝着梅内姆总统倡议签订社会契约的方向迈出的“第一步”。
    据认为，这是梅内姆7月8日就任阿根廷总统以来在克服国内严重经济困难方面采取的又一重要措施。
