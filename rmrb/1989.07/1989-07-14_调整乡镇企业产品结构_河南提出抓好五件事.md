    Henan Proposes Five Key Tasks to Adjust the Product Structure of Township Enterprises

    Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, July 14th - Reporter Li Jie reports: At the recently concluded provincial township enterprise work conference, Henan Province Governor Cheng Weigao pointed out: To ensure the completion of the national macro-adjustment targets, in response to existing problems, Henan Province has decided to focus on five key tasks to adjust the product structure of township enterprises, promoting their healthy development.

    First, according to national industrial policies and the actual situation in Henan, the Township Enterprise Bureau will work with the Economic Commission and relevant departments to quickly formulate a guiding document for Henan Province's township enterprise industrial policies, providing correct guidance for the development of township enterprises.

    Second, for new projects, in accordance with national regulations, establish strict approval procedures. Any township enterprises that are high in energy and material consumption, severely polluting, competing with large-scale industries for energy and raw materials, or producing excess, stagnant, and accumulated products will not be approved.

    Third, for ongoing "half-finished" projects, conduct an individual assessment. For those that are high in energy consumption and raw material usage, propose handling opinions; for those with less than 50% investment completion, firmly order them to stop construction. Factories and equipment can be auctioned off or acquired by profitable enterprises.

    Fourth, conduct a thorough survey of existing small-scale smelting, refining, cement, papermaking, and cotton spinning industries. Based on the situation, consider power supply, resource conditions, market demand, and pollution levels. Decisively eliminate a batch of those that should be phased out.

    Fifth, focus on supporting the production of energy, raw material industries, agricultural and sideline product processing industries, agricultural support industries, export-earning industries, and daily consumer goods that are in short supply in the market.

    调整乡镇企业产品结构
    河南提出抓好五件事
    本报郑州7月14日电　记者李杰报道：河南省省长程维高在日前结束的省乡镇企业工作会议上指出：为确保国家宏观调整目标的完成，针对存在的问题，河南省决定抓好五件事，调整乡镇企业产品结构，促使乡镇企业健康发展。
    一、根据国家产业政策和本省实际，乡镇企业局会同计经委和有关部门，迅速制订河南省乡镇企业产业政策的指导性文件，正确指导乡镇企业的发展。
    二、对新上项目，按照国家规定，建立严格的审批手续，凡是能耗、物耗高，污染严重，与大工业争能源、争原料，以及产品过剩、滞销积压的乡镇企业一律不再审批。
    三、对在建的“半拉子”工程，逐个排队，凡属于高能耗、高原材料消耗的项目，要逐个提出处理意见；对投资完成50％以下的，坚决令其停建，厂房、设备可以拍卖或让效益好的企业兼并。
    四、对现有的小冶炼、小炼油、小水泥、小造纸、小棉纺等进行一次认真普查，在弄清情况的基础上，视电力、资源条件、市场需求、污染程度，该砍的，下决心砍掉一批。
    五、重点支持发展能源、原材料工业、农副产品加工业、支农工业、出口创汇工业和市场紧缺的日用消费品工业的生产。
