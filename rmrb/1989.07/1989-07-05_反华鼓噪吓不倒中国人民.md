The Chinese government's struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing has achieved decisive victory. The social life in the capital has basically returned to normal, and the situation across the country has quickly stabilized. The truth behind this disturbance and counter-revolutionary riot is gradually being understood by people around the world. At this moment, the U.S. House of Representatives, disregarding all this, passed a series of so-called "sanctions" against China in a foreign aid bill on June 29. We cannot but express our utmost indignation at the actions of some people in the U.S. Congress who blatantly distort the facts and arrogantly interfere in China's internal affairs.

It is well known that the recent counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing was meticulously planned by a few individuals who harbor hostility towards the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. The riot aimed to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, subvert the People's Republic of China, and transform China into a bourgeois republic. In this extremely urgent and serious situation, to defend the republic, safeguard the power won by countless martyrs with their blood, and protect the achievements of China's construction and reform, the Chinese government had to take necessary measures in accordance with the constitution and law to quell the riot. This is a legitimate and lawful measure that any sovereign country would take in such a situation. After China explained the truth about the incident to the outside world, many international figures, upon understanding the actual situation, have gradually shown understanding for the measures China took to quell the riot.

However, some individuals in the U.S. Congress who harbor hostility towards China and the socialist system are unwilling to understand the facts. Driven by their anti-communist class instincts, they repeatedly interfere in China's internal affairs and plot one "sanction" after another to pressure China, attempting to force China to submit.

Of course, we do not believe that all members of the U.S. House of Representatives are anti-China. Some may not be aware of the true situation. However, it is undeniable that there are indeed some individuals in the U.S. legislative body who are accustomed to posing as "guardians of democracy and freedom," meddling in the internal affairs of other countries. Despite their silence on the use of fully armed police by their own rulers to suppress the struggle of African Americans for basic human rights and the protests of students against the Vietnam War, they hypocritically claim to be "defenders of human rights," unreasonably accusing China of "bloody suppression of the democratic movement" for quelling the counter-revolutionary riot. When China's disturbance began in mid-April, evolving from a student movement to turmoil and then to a counter-revolutionary riot, some Americans did their utmost to fan the flames and stir up trouble. After China quelled the counter-revolutionary riot, they held special hearings for so-called "Chinese democrats" one day and provided "shelter" for people like Fang Lizhi the next, actively inciting a new wave of anti-China sentiment. Their mindset is that they fear nothing more than a stable China. Linking their behavior of blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs on issues such as Taiwan, Tibet, and so-called "human rights," one can see the deep enmity these people harbor towards the People's Republic of China. To them, a strong, united, socialist China under the leadership of the Communist Party is not to their liking. Only by making China undergo bourgeois liberalization under the guise of "democracy and freedom," and implementing a capitalist system in China, will they be satisfied. China's government and people, of course, will not agree to this. Their dream will never come true.

Some members of the U.S. House of Representatives attempt to pressure us through new "sanction" measures against China, but this is completely futile. China will not yield to any external pressure. We are willing to develop relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and increase exchanges. However, we have always adhered to the principle of independence and self-reliance. Our development and construction mainly rely on our own strength. Even in difficult conditions, we will not compromise our principles. Moreover, this is no longer an era where some Americans can do as they please. Whether it is "sanctions" or "embargoes," they have not made the Chinese people bow their heads in the past, and they will not achieve their goals now. China's policy of opening up to the outside world will not change. More and more enlightened people in the international community believe that China's reform and opening-up policy will be maintained for a long time, and China's foreign economic and trade relations will be further developed. Many businesspeople and business communities in various countries also do not want to sever economic ties with China and do not want to give up the vast market of 1.1 billion people. The attempt to exclude China from the international community is very unwise and shortsighted.

It is noted that the Bush administration has expressed that it "cannot accept" the package of resolutions passed by the U.S. House of Representatives aimed at "sanctioning" China. The U.S. government's criticism of China's quelling of the counter-revolutionary riot and its unilateral decision to "sanction" China are deeply regrettable. However, we have noted that the Bush administration has repeatedly stated that it should "respond cautiously" to China's incident and believes that maintaining good relations with China is "in the interest of the United States." Indeed, the development of Sino-U.S. relations to this day has been established through the long-term efforts of both sides and is in the interest of both countries. We hope that the U.S. government and the majority of U.S. congressmen will, based on the fundamental interests of the peoples of both countries, prioritize the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations and not do anything that harms the relationship. If the U.S. government succumbs to the pressure of some congressmen, causing the hard-won Sino-U.S. relations to suffer serious damage, this will not only be detrimental to the stability of the world situation but will ultimately be of no benefit to the United States.

    反华鼓噪吓不倒中国人民
    本报评论员
    中国政府平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱的斗争取得决定性胜利后，首都的社会生活已基本恢复正常，全国局势也迅速趋于稳定。这场动乱和反革命暴乱的真相，也逐渐为世界各国所了解。正在这个时候，美国众议院不顾这一切，又于6月29日在一项援外法案中通过了一系列所谓对中国新的“制裁”措施。对美国国会中一些人肆意歪曲事实真相、蛮横干涉中国内政的行径，我们不能不表示极大的愤慨。
    众所周知，不久前在北京发生的反革命暴乱，是少数敌视中国共产党和社会主义制度的人蓄谋策划的。这场暴乱旨在推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国，把中国改变为资产阶级共和国。在这种极端危急而严重的形势下，为保卫共和国，捍卫无数先烈用鲜血换来的政权，保卫我国建设和改革的胜利成果，中国政府不得不根据宪法和法律断然采取必要的措施，平息了这场暴乱。这是世界上任何一个主权国家在面对这种局势下都会采取的正当的合法的措施。在中国向外界介绍了事件的真相之后，不少国际人士在了解实际情况后已逐渐对我国为平息这场暴乱采取的措施表示理解。
    但是，美国国会内一些敌视中国、敌视社会主义制度的人，总是不愿了解事实真相，凭着他们反共的阶级本能，对中国的内部事务横加干涉，一而再、再而三地策划一个又一个“制裁”来对中国施加压力，妄图迫使中国就范。
    当然，我们并不认为美国国会众议院的议员都是反华的，有些可能不了解事情真相。但是不可否认的是，美国立法机构中确有那么一些人，习惯于以“民主、自由卫士”自居，对别国的内政指手划脚。尽管他们对本国统治者动用全副武装的军警镇压黑人争取基本人权斗争和学生反对侵越战争示威不置一词，却偏要道貌岸然地自诩为“人权”卫道士，无理指责中国平息反革命暴乱是什么“血腥镇压民主运动”。在今年4月中旬中国开始的先由学潮发展到动乱、又发展到反革命暴乱之际，美国的某些人为中国动乱竭尽煽风点火、推波助澜之能事。当中国平息反革命暴乱之后，他们又今天为所谓“中国的民主义士”举行什么特别听证会，明天为方励之之流提供所谓“庇护”，积极鼓动起新的反华浪潮。他们的心态是唯恐中国天下不乱。联系这些人在我国台湾问题、“西藏问题”以及所谓“人权问题”上一贯肆无忌惮地干涉我国内政的行为，可以看出，这些人对中华人民共和国怀有多么深的敌意。对他们来说，中国共产党领导下的一个富强、统一的社会主义中国是不合他们口味的，只有使中国在“民主、自由”的幌子下，搞资产阶级自由化，在中国实行资本主义制度，他们才会感到高兴。对此，中国政府和人民当然是不会答应的。他们的这种梦想是永远不会实现的。
    美国众议院的某些人企图通过对中国采取新的“制裁”措施，来对我们施加压力，是完全徒劳的。中国决不屈服于外来的任何压力。我们愿意同一切国家在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展关系，增加往来。但是我们一贯奉行独立自主的方针，我们的发展和建设主要依靠自己的力量。即使在困难的条件下，我们也不会放弃原则去做交易。何况，今天已不是某些美国人可以为所欲为的时代了。无论“制裁”也好，“禁运”也好，过去没有使中国人民低头，现在也同样不会使那些不怀好意的人达到自己的目的。中国对外开放的政策是不会变的。目前国际上越来越多的有识之士相信，中国的改革开放政策将长期坚持下去，中国的对外经济贸易关系将进一步得到发展。许多国家的企业家、工商界人士也不希望中断同中国的经济往来，不愿意放弃11亿人口的巨大市场。那种试图把中国排斥在国际社会之外的做法，是很不明智的，也是短视的。
    人们注意到，对于美国众议院通过的旨在“制裁”中国的一揽子决议，布什政府已表示“不能接受”。美国政府对中国平息反革命暴乱一事加以指责，并单方面作出“制裁”中国的决定，对此我们不能不深为遗憾。但我们注意到布什政府也一再表示对中国的事件应该“反应谨慎”，认为保持同中国的良好关系是“符合美国的国家利益的”。确实，中美关系发展到今天，是经过中美双方长期努力建立起来的，是符合中美两国利益的。我们希望美国政府和大多数美国议员能从中美两国人民的根本利益出发，以维护中美关系的大局为重，不要做损害两国关系的事情。如果美国政府屈服于国会某些人的压力，使来之不易的中美关系受到严重损害，这不仅不利于世界局势的稳定，到头来对美国也绝没有什么好处。
