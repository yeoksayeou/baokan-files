A type of "Pilot Respiratory Protection Equipment" that allows flight personnel to survive and operate in nuclear and chemical conditions has been successfully developed and passed technical appraisal in mid-July at a certain unit of the Air Force. This achievement marks that the Chinese Air Force now possesses the capability to operate in nuclear, chemical, and other contaminated environments.

This protective equipment utilizes the flight helmet and filter canister, employing methods such as under-wing filtered air supply and on-board pure oxygen inhalation. It successfully addresses many high-difficulty topics, including the "specialized blower" and the "flight helmet anti-static seal standard."
