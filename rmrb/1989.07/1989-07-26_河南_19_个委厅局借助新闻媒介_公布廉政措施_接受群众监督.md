Today, 19 departments in Henan Province, which are widely regarded as having power, influence, money, and resources, announced their anti-corruption measures in the Henan Daily and Henan Radio, accepting supervision from the people of the entire province.

A responsible comrade from the provincial government told reporters that, in general, most of Henan's leading cadres and government officials are honest and diligent in their work. However, in some places and units, especially in some leading departments and officials who manage money, goods, and people, there are indeed corruption issues, and some are quite serious, which has caused great dissatisfaction among the people. Therefore, the provincial government instructed the Provincial Government Office, Provincial Economic Commission, and departments such as Labor and Personnel, Public Security, Finance, Taxation, Industry and Commerce, as well as financial institutions, to take the lead in formulating anti-corruption regulations and measures for "two open, one supervision." It is understood that the anti-corruption measures announced by these 19 departments and units in newspapers and radio today are formulated based on the actual situation and work characteristics of each department, after full discussion and deliberation by all staff, and after widely soliciting opinions from relevant parties.

At the conclusion of the Henan Provincial Government's full meeting today, Governor Cheng Weigao emphasized that all levels of departments managing people, finance, and materials, as well as the "seven bureaus and eight stations" that directly deal with the masses, must implement "two open, one supervision" without exception, publicly announce anti-corruption measures, and accept supervision from the people. Not only should anti-corruption systems be established, but more importantly, management and supervision measures to ensure the implementation and enforcement of these systems should be established.

    河南19个委厅局借助新闻媒介
    公布廉政措施  接受群众监督
    本报郑州7月26日电　记者李杰报道：今天，河南省19个被人们认为是“有权、有势、有钱、有物”的一些委、厅、局，在河南日报和河南电台上公布了各自廉政建设措施，接受全省人民监督。
    省政府负责同志对记者说，从总体上说，河南的大多数领导干部和政府机关工作人员是廉洁奉公、勤奋工作的。但在一些地方和单位，特别是一些“管钱、管物、管人”的领导机关和机关工作人员中，确实存在着腐败现象，有的还相当严重，群众十分不满。为此，省政府指示省政府办公厅、省计经委和劳动人事、公安、财政、税务、工商以及金融等19个部门和单位，先行一步，制定各自的廉政建设规定和两公开一监督的措施。据了解，这19个部门和单位今天在报纸和电台上公布的廉政措施，都是结合本部门的实际及工作特点，经过全体工作人员充分酝酿、讨论，并广泛征求有关方面意见的基础上制订出来的。
    在今天结束的河南省政府全会上，省长程维高强调，各级主管人、财、物的部门和直接与群众打交道的“七所八站”，都要无一例外地实行“两公开，一监督”，公开廉政建设措施，接受人民群众的监督。不仅要制订廉政制度，更重要的是要制订保证制度实行和落实的管理、监督办法。
