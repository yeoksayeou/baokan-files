Public-funded tourism has become a trend in many places, which is detrimental to controlling the growth of consumption funds. According to a survey of public-funded tourism in our county, the main manifestations are as follows:

The number of tourists is increasing. Since April this year, many units in our county have continuously organized personnel to travel to Xi'an, Luoyang, and other places using public funds. Statistics show that the units using public funds for tourism account for 61% of the county's administrative, enterprise, and public institutions, with over 3,000 people, an increase of 3.2 times compared to the same period last year.

Consumption is astronomical. Most tourists use vehicles provided by their units or rent vehicles and are given travel allowances. According to incomplete statistics, the county has spent 323,000 yuan on tourism in the first half of this year. Of this amount, 75,000 yuan was spent on vehicle fees, 48,000 yuan on travel allowances, and 200,000 yuan on personal consumption. Personal consumption is also high, with an average of over 50 yuan per person spent on photography alone.

The tourism season has arrived, and some units are using public funds to organize cadres and employees for tourism. According to reports, the reasons for the prevalence of public-funded tourism are as follows: First, it is caused by the psychology of keeping up with the Joneses. When a supervisory department organizes personnel for public-funded tourism, its subordinate units follow suit; when Unit A's public-funded tourists have just left, Unit B's leaders, under pressure, also have to quickly organize their own. Second, tourism is conducted under the guise of inspection and study tours. This situation is quite common. Third, some units use public-funded tourism as one of the means to reward advanced units and individuals. The appearance of this reward method often becomes an excuse for some units to engage in public-funded tourism, and the personnel participating in the tourism are not necessarily representatives of advanced individuals and units.

If the trend of public-funded tourism continues to spread, it will not only directly disrupt the normal work order of some units but also cause the consumption funds of some units to inflate, making the production fund gap even larger.

### 公费旅游加剧消费膨胀影响工作秩序

    公费旅游加剧消费膨胀影响工作秩序
    公费旅游在许多地方形成一股“热流”。这对控制消费基金增长十分不利。据对我县公费旅游情况的调查，其主要表现有以下两方面：
    旅游人数增多。从今年4月开始，我县许多单位连续不断地组织人员公费到西安、洛阳等地旅游。据统计，公费旅游的单位占全县行政企事业单位的61％，人数达3000多人，比去年同期增加了3.2倍。
    消费惊人，旅游者大部分是单位出车或租用车辆，并发给出差补助。据不完全统计，我县今年上半年用于旅游的消费金额已达32.3万元。其中，车辆费7.5万元，出差费补助4.8万元，个人消费20万元。个人消费也很大，仅照像每人平均开支50多元。

    旅游旺季到了，一些单位用公费组织干部、职工旅游。据了解，公费旅游风盛行有以下原因：一是攀比心理造成的。某主管部门组织人员公费旅游，其下属单位则进而效仿；甲单位公费旅游人员刚出发，乙单位的领导迫于压力，也得赶快组织。二是以参观、考察为名进行公费旅游。这种情况比较普遍。三是一些单位把用公费旅游作为奖励先进单位和个人的手段之一。这种奖励方式的出现，往往成了一些单位借机公费旅游的由头，参加旅游的人员中，并非都是先进个人和先进单位的代表。
    公费旅游风如果到处蔓延，不仅直接打乱了一些单位正常的工作秩序，也使得一些单位消费基金膨胀，生产资金缺口更大。
