At the construction site of the Xing 13-1 Integrated Station being built by the Sixth Division of the Dazhou Oil Construction Company in the southern part of Daqing, sparks from welding torches are flying. The 22-year-old young welder Yan Guihua, with her skilled movements and superior techniques, is praised by everyone as a shining new star in welding.

**Aspiration**

In February 1987, Yan Guihua started working, becoming one of the first batch of contract workers after the labor and personnel system reform in the Oil Construction Company. At that time, she was very excited and happy because she had achieved her childhood dream of becoming an honorable oil worker.

She wrote in the first page of her diary: "A truly ambitious young person must have a beautiful ideal. If someone asks about my ideal, it is to be dedicated to the oil field and to be a female strongman among contract workers."

However, from the first day of work, various prejudices came her way. Once, when she went to the cafeteria to eat, a few young men made up a rhyme about her on the spot: "A girl in her late teens, slender figure and big eyes, just unlucky to be born at the wrong time, the contract system has lowered her value." At that time, she was so angry that she didn't even eat her meal and went back to the dormitory to cry. Her parents, knowing that she had become a welder, were worried that she couldn't handle the hard work because her father had worked in the oil construction unit for over 30 years and knew the bittersweet life of a welder. Some of her closer classmates also came to persuade her one after another: "Guihua, why are you being so silly? Contract workers are already looked down upon by others, and now you've become a welder. You should ask your dad to find someone to change your job."

Yan, who had once been full of poetry and romance, was in a state of hesitation and had even developed a sense of inferiority. However, she finally stood firm with her self-confidence, self-respect, and self-love, overcoming all the prejudices.

**Standing Out**

In the early morning, before the night sky had lifted, she practiced her arm strength with dumbbells under the watchful eyes of the sparse stars; at noon, she put down her chopsticks and went to the construction site early, practicing welding under the scorching sun; at night, while her companions were already in dreamland, she was still studying welding theory. Yan Guihua used her spare time to learn voraciously, reading technical books such as "Welder's Theoretical Knowledge," "What Welders Should Know and Do," and "Welder's Operating Procedures," and taking over ten thousand words of study notes. In this way, she poured her whole heart into the welding rod and the welding sparks, overcoming countless difficulties with her tenacious will. Her efforts paid off, and after three months of work, she could work independently and won the second place in the third-level welding competition held by the division company.

Early last year, the division company took on the construction of the North II-1 tank with a capacity of 20,000 cubic meters. To speed up the construction, a comprehensive construction team for large tanks was established, and naturally, technical experts were selected to participate. Yan Guihua was not at ease when she heard this. She was the first to write an application to join the large tank construction team. The team leader considered her young and having worked for a short time, so he did not approve her application. She made a pledge to the division company's leaders: "For every weld I make, if it is not up to standard, I will use my spare time to rework it and forfeit my entire month's bonus." Seeing her determination, after much consideration, the division company's leaders decided to conduct a single technical assessment for her before the official start of work. She seized every opportunity to practice her skills, and in just one week, her face and neck were sunburned and peeling, her hands were blistered, and she lost two kilograms of weight. Finally, she passed the assessment with excellent results and became one of the three female welders in the large tank construction team.

**Tempering**

Yan Guihua wrote in her diary: "Technical progress is just the first step I have taken, and more importantly, I should apply the skills I have mastered to the actual work of oil field construction, tempering myself in a harsh environment, and constantly improving myself."

Last September, the company decided to build the Xing II-1 tank with a capacity of 20,000 cubic meters, requiring the completion of a 100-day task in 40 days. To save time, each welder had to weld over 70 meters a day, which was a challenge for a female worker. Leaders and foremen all advised her not to compete with the male workers and to rest when she was tired. Yan Guihua always responded with a smile: "Sometimes I really want to lie down on the large tank and have a good sleep, but time waits for no one! After completing the task, I will make sure to sleep for three days and three nights." The excessive workload and long working hours quickly made her thin. Just at this time, her family called to say that her father was hospitalized due to illness. The leaders took this opportunity to order her to go back immediately, but she said: "If I leave, won't that be one less person? Besides, my father is sick and in the hospital, with my mother taking care of him, it's no use going back." Through everyone's efforts, the task was completed in just 38 days. Yan Guihua stayed on the construction site for 38 consecutive days, welding over 2,000 meters of the large tank, and all the quality met the excellent standard. The division company awarded her a commendation, and the company's youth league named her as a "Youth Shock Worker Model," calling on all young league members to learn from her.

In May 1989, after competing with 600 welders, Yan Guihua was selected to go abroad to participate in the construction of large tanks with her excellent welding skills, becoming the youngest member of the 30-strong elite team. When leaving Daqing, a reporter pushed through the crowd to interview her. Yan Guihua didn't say much, leaving only a sentence, "My journey is still long..."

    焊花闪亮
    ——记青年电焊女工阎桂花
    郑传体
    在大庆南部油建第六分公司承建的杏13—1联合站的施工现场，一簇簇焊花闪亮，年仅22岁的年轻焊工阎桂花，动作娴熟，技术高超，人们称赞她是一颗闪亮的电焊“新星”。
      追　求
    1987年2月，阎桂花走上工作岗位，成为油建公司劳动人事制度改革后的第一批合同制工人。当时的她，心情十分激动和高兴，因为实现了从小立志长大要当一名光荣的石油工人的追求。
    她在日记的首页写道：“一个真正有抱负的青年，他必定有个美好的理想。如果有人问我的理想，那就是志在油田，誓做合同制工人中的女强人。”
    但是，从上班第一天起，各方面的偏见向她袭来，一次小阎到食堂就餐，几名小青年当众给她编了一套顺口溜：“姑娘芳龄十七八，身材苗条眼睛大，只是生来不逢时，合同制降低了她的价”。当时气得她连饭都没吃，回到宿舍大哭一场。父母知道她当了电焊工后，担心她吃不消这个苦，因为小阎的父亲在油建单位干了30多年，知道电焊工的酸甜苦辣。一些比较要好的同学也先后登门劝说：“桂花，你冒什么傻气，合同工本来别人就看不起，现在又当上了电焊工，还不让你爸爸赶快找人调换一下工种”。
    脑海一度充满诗情画意的小阎，陷入徘徊、犹豫，并曾产生自卑感。然而，她终于以自信、自尊、自爱的毅力顶住了各方面的偏见。
            冒　尖
    清晨，夜幕还笼罩着天空，稀疏的星星看着她手托哑铃练臂力；中午，她放下碗筷提前到工地，顶着炎热的烈日练习焊接；夜深，同伴们都进入了梦乡，可她仍然伏案学习焊接理论知识。阎桂花利用业余时间如饥似渴地学习，先后读完了《电焊工理论知识》、《焊工应知应会》、《焊工操作规程》等技术书籍，记了上万字的学习笔记。就这样，她把全部身心随焊条一道溶入焊花之中，以顽强的毅力战胜了重重困难。功夫不负有心人，参加工作三个月就能单独顶岗，并在分公司举办的技术比赛中，获三级组焊工比赛第二名。
    去年年初，分公司承担了北Ⅱ—1两万立方米罐的施工任务，为加快施工速度，决定成立一个大罐综合施工队，当然要选派技术尖子参加。阎桂花听到后心里很不平静，第一个写申请报名参加大罐施工队，大队领导考虑她年轻，参加工作时间短，没有批准。她向分公司领导立下了军令状：“凡是我焊的焊口，如不合格，除利用业余时间返工外，扣除我当月的全部奖金。”分公司领导看到她决心坚定，经过再三考虑，决定在正式开工之前对她进行单个技术考核。她抓紧一切时间苦练技术，在一个星期内，脸和脖子因日晒火烤剥了一层皮，手也烫起了一个个水泡，体重掉了两公斤，终于以优异的成绩通过了考核，成为大罐施工队仅有的3名女电焊工之一。
    磨　练
    阎桂花在日记中写道：“技术上的进步，还只是我刚刚迈出的第一步，更重要的是要把掌握的真本领用到油田建设的实际工作中去，在艰苦的环境里锻炼自己，不断完善自我。”
    去年9月，公司决定承建杏Ⅱ—1两万立方米罐，要求100天的任务40天完成。为了抢时间，每个电焊工一天要焊70多延长米，这对一个女同志来说，困难是可想而知的。领导和师傅们都劝她不要和男同志比着干，累了就休息一下。阎桂花每次都是笑着说：“有时我真想躺在大罐上好好睡一觉，但时间不等人啊！任务完成后，我保证好好睡它三天三夜。”超负荷的工作量和较长的工作时间，很快使她消瘦下来。正巧这时家中来电话说父亲因病住院，领导借这个机会命令她马上回去，她却说：“我一走不又少了一份力量吗？再说父亲病了，住在医院，有母亲照顾，回去也没有用”。经过大家的努力，仅用38天就圆满完成了任务。阎桂花整整在工地住了38天，焊接大罐达2000余米，并且质量全部达到优质标准。分公司为她记了功，公司团委命名她为“青年突击手标兵”称号，并号召全体团员青年向她学习。
    1989年5月，经过600名电焊工的激烈竞争，阎桂花以过硬的焊接技术，当之无愧地被选定出国参加大罐施工，成为这支30多人精干队伍中最年轻的一名。在离开大庆时，记者挤过人群采访了她，小阎没有多说，只留下一句“我的路还长”……
