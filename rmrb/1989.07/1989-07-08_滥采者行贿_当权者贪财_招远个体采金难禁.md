In the Linglong mining area of the Zhao Yuan Gold Mine in Shandong Province, there is a mountain gully less than 300 meters long where over 400 individual gold miners have gathered. Most of them come from Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. At the entrance of the gully, there are 11 large-scale mining tunnels in the form of passages. The daily output of these tunnels reaches thousands of tons. The reporter saw that on the winding mountain road, trucks, tractors, and small handcarts carrying ore were coming and going.

The reporter asked their foreman, “Did you get permission to enter the state-owned mining area to mine?”

The answer was, “Farmers don’t need permission for individual mining. Everyone does it this way.”

The reporter asked, “Did you hear about the notice issued by the State Council in November last year to crack down on individual gold mining across the country?”

The answer was, “No.”

The reporter asked, “To whom do you sell the ore you mine?”

The answer was, “To whoever offers the most money.”

The reporter asked, “Does the local government know that you are mining here?”

The answer was, “If you give them some money or a gold ring, no one will bother you.”

Wang, the director of the Zhao Yuan Gold Mine, reported to the reporter: The mining area has been looted multiple times by individual gold miners, and a large amount of reserve ore has been dug up, leaving it full of holes. Unexplored ore sections have been torn apart. The mine department has repeatedly reported the situation to the provincial, municipal, and county governments, but the problem has not been resolved. The State Council’s notice on the protective mining of gold mineral resources has become a mere piece of paper here.

### 滥采者行贿　当权者贪财  招远个体采金难禁

    滥采者行贿　当权者贪财
    招远个体采金难禁
    在山东省招远金矿玲珑矿区内一条不到300米长的山沟里，聚集着400多名个体采金者。他们大多是从浙江、福建、广东等地来的。在山沟的入口处，仅以巷道形式大规模开采的洞口就有11个。这些坑口的日出矿量达千吨之多。记者看到：在崎岖的盘山山路上，运矿的汽车、拖拉机、人力小推车络绎不绝。
    记者问他们的工头：“你们进入国营矿区采矿是经过哪儿批准的？”
    答：“农民个体采矿不用哪儿批，大家都是这么干的。”
    记者问：“去年11月国务院发出通知，要在各地取缔个体采金，你们听说过没有？”
    答：“没有。”
    记者问：
  “你们采的矿石卖给谁？”
    答：“谁给的钱多，就卖给谁。”
    记者问：“你们在这儿采矿，当地政府知道吗？”
    答：“给他们送点钱，或送个金戒指就没人管了。”
    招远金矿王矿长向记者反映：该矿区多次遭到个体采金群众的哄抢，大量的备采矿被挖得千疮百孔，未探明的矿段被搞得支离破碎。矿部多次向省、地、市反映情况，但问题始终得不到解决。国务院关于对黄金矿产资源实行保护性开采的通知在这里成了一纸空文。
