The contract responsibility system is facing challenges. This is not primarily about the long-standing criticisms, but rather about the new problems that have arisen due to the system's imperfections. Whether these problems can be solved will determine the future and fate of the contract responsibility system.

"The Eternal System" and "Abolition": How to Evaluate?

How long should the contract responsibility system be implemented? There are two opposing views on this issue: one is the "eternal system" view, and the other is the "abolition" view.

In my opinion, the contract responsibility system cannot be eternal. There is no such thing as an unchanging entity in the world. Regardless of the various opinions, the urgent task at hand is to further improve and develop the contract responsibility system.

Currently, the need to improve and develop the contract responsibility system is driven by the need to manage the economic environment. The central task of managing the environment is to improve the balance between total supply and total demand. This not only requires limiting demand but also increasing supply. There are two ways to increase supply: one is to increase capital investment to boost production. However, increasing capital investment will directly lead to increased demand, exacerbating the supply-demand contradiction. Therefore, this method should be used but not excessively. The second method is to improve the enterprise management mechanism to enhance productivity. This can increase supply without increasing or with minimal increase in investment, making it an ideal approach. Implementing the contract responsibility system aims to improve the enterprise management mechanism, so it can play a significant role in managing the environment. Additionally, the contract responsibility system can create conditions for other reforms. It can improve economic efficiency and thus improve fiscal revenue and expenditure, and it can also increase the production of scarce resources, improving the supply-demand situation. These conditions are necessary for the implementation of other reforms (including price reforms). Therefore, we should not forget that managing the environment is for the sake of reform, and managing the environment also requires reform. The contract responsibility system can play an important role in this process.

Saying the contract responsibility system is eternal is incorrect, but abolishing it is also not feasible. So, how long should the contract responsibility system be implemented? This depends on two conditions: first, how much the contract responsibility system itself can be improved. If the new problems caused by the system's imperfections cannot be solved, it will have to "step down and make way for others." Second, how much the overall reform environment can develop. If the environment does not allow for a better approach, the contract responsibility system will have to continue.

"The Base Method" and "Coefficient Method": How to Choose?

The effectiveness of the contract responsibility system depends on multiple factors, and scientifically determining the fiscal turnover indicators plays a crucial role. Improving the contract responsibility system first requires solving this problem.

Currently, the method used to determine fiscal turnover indicators is called the "base method," which uses each enterprise's turnover tax from the previous year (or the average of the previous three years) as the base to determine the fiscal turnover indicators. This method has two major issues: first, enterprises that were previously well-managed have high bases and thus high turnover indicators, resulting in less retained profit; enterprises that were previously poorly managed have low bases and thus low turnover indicators, resulting in more retained profit. This "whipping the fast cow" result does not encourage enterprises to create more turnover tax but rather encourages them to "hold back" and aim for a low base. Now, about 70-80% of enterprises' contracts are about to expire, and if this problem is not solved, it will have serious consequences. Second, enterprises producing high-priced, high-profit products find it relatively easy to increase turnover tax, while enterprises producing low-priced, low-profit products find it relatively difficult to increase turnover tax. In this situation, using the "base method" to determine turnover indicators not only disrupts the boundary between well-managed and poorly managed enterprises due to price distortions but also leads to unfair retained profits.

The solution to this problem is to replace the "base method" with the "coefficient method" to determine the fiscal turnover indicators.

Economic efficiency is the ratio of input to output. The capital turnover tax rate can reflect the input-output ratio of materialized labor, and the wage turnover tax rate can reflect the input-output ratio of active labor. Therefore, the average capital turnover tax rate and wage turnover tax rate of the same industry can be used as indicators of the average economic efficiency of the same industry.

The ratio of each enterprise's capital turnover tax rate to the average turnover tax rate of the same industry can be called the "capital efficiency coefficient"; the ratio of each enterprise's wage turnover tax rate to the average wage turnover tax rate of the same industry can be called the "wage efficiency coefficient." For convenience of application, a weighted average method can be used to combine the two efficiency coefficients into one "economic efficiency coefficient." According to the research by Yang Tuan from the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, the weight of the capital efficiency coefficient can be 0.7, and the weight of the wage efficiency coefficient can be 0.3. Using this method, each enterprise's economic efficiency coefficient can be easily calculated based on statistical data. The formula is: capital efficiency coefficient multiplied by 0.7, plus wage efficiency coefficient multiplied by 0.3. From this, it can be seen that each enterprise's economic efficiency coefficient is a quantitative result of measuring each enterprise's economic efficiency using the average economic efficiency of the same industry as the standard. Determining the fiscal turnover indicators based on the economic efficiency coefficient can solve the "whipping the fast cow" problem and, to a considerable extent, eliminate the interference of price distortion factors.

Currently, completely determining the fiscal turnover indicators based on the economic efficiency coefficient still has some practical issues to solve, mainly that enterprises with particularly low economic efficiency will not dare or be willing to contract due to the large gap. Therefore, a transitional approach can be adopted, which is to use the economic efficiency coefficient as the basis to adjust the turnover indicators determined by the base. This way, although it cannot completely solve the "whipping the fast cow" problem, it can reduce the degree of "whipping the fast cow"; moreover, when adjusting the turnover indicators, it is not based on subjective will but has data as the basis.

Short-term Behavior: How to Solve?

Some enterprises have exhibited short-term behavior after contracting, mainly manifesting as sacrificing accumulation for distribution in other aspects, reducing investment, and affecting long-term development. This is another important problem that needs to be solved to improve the contract responsibility system.

How to solve the short-term behavior problem needs to be studied from three levels:

First, distinguish between two situations. Some enterprises' short-term behavior must be solved, while some enterprises' short-term behavior does not necessarily need to be solved. Our current structure is not reasonable, and some enterprises are engaged in redundant duplicate production. These enterprises, before adjusting their product structure, will not benefit from developing long-term capabilities; instead, it will be harmful. For these types of enterprises, the issue is not solving the short-term behavior problem but adjusting the structure; only for enterprises that need to develop according to industrial policies, the short-term behavior must be corrected.

Second, solving the short-term behavior problem of enterprises that need to develop requires adjusting policies or improving the contracting method. For example, coal production enterprises, due to low pricing and limited retained profits, can only balance accumulation and distribution, usually prioritizing distribution and sacrificing accumulation. Solving the short-term behavior problem of these enterprises requires adjusting policies. Either adjust the pricing policy to increase prices, or adjust the investment policy to increase investment, or appropriately reduce the enterprise's base and stipulate the proportion of retained profits used for accumulation.

Third, improve the contracting method from the aspects of contracting content and contracting period.

Short-term behavior is first related to the contracting content. Enterprises that only contract fiscal turnover tasks and link turnover tax growth with total wages are prone to short-term behavior. Because the contracting content encourages short-term behavior without constraining it. For this situation, the contracting content of enterprises that need to develop should implement "two guarantees and two links," that is, guaranteeing the completion of realized turnover tax indicators and linking them with total wages; guaranteeing the completion of technical transformation plans and linking them with the rewards and punishments of managers. This way, short-term behavior is constrained from the contracting content.

Short-term behavior is also related to the contracting period. Generally, the longer the contracting period, the more conducive it is to suppressing short-term behavior. Currently, most enterprises have a contracting period of three to five years, but for a modern enterprise, planning development with a period of three to five years is too short; extending the contracting period further will bring new problems. Some places are trying rolling contracts, which may be a beneficial exploration to solve this contradiction.

"The Contract Responsibility System" and "Structural Optimization": How to Unify?

Adjusting the structure solely through new investment and implementing a tilted policy is far from sufficient; it is necessary to make the existing assets flow. Combining the tilted policy of incremental assets with the flow of existing assets can complement each other and enhance the effect.

However, the contract responsibility system requires each enterprise to develop and expand on its current basis; otherwise, the contract will not be completed. This makes the existing structure rigid and cannot, according to industrial policies, make the existing assets flow from enterprises that do not need to develop to enterprises that need to develop. This is the contradiction between the contract responsibility system and optimizing the structure.

Solving this contradiction is not possible by relying solely on improving the contract responsibility system itself; it must be combined with enterprise mergers to solve the contradiction that the contract responsibility system itself cannot solve.

In this regard, Beijing has provided valuable experience. In 1988, 20 enterprises did not complete their contracts, of which 5 enterprises with mismatched products were merged by other enterprises. Generally, there are two reasons why enterprises cannot complete their contracts: one is the issue of managers; the other is the issue of enterprise structure. The first situation can be solved by re-tendering to produce new managers. The second situation cannot be solved by simply changing managers, so enterprise mergers should be implemented. This way, the contract responsibility system and enterprise mergers are naturally combined.

By the way, within the scope of a province or a city, if 100% of enterprises can complete their contracts, it is not necessarily a normal situation; it is normal for a few enterprises not to complete their contracts. At this time, the causes should be analyzed specifically, and those that need to change managers should change managers, and those that need to be merged should be decisively merged by other enterprises.

Enterprise mergers are a direction. Mergers can take the form of asset transfers or enterprises contracting enterprises. The situation of enterprises is very complex, and nothing should be done in a one-size-fits-all manner. As long as it is conducive to the reasonable adjustment of the industrial structure and the improvement of enterprise economic efficiency, various forms can be adopted.

High-level Constraint Mechanism and Low-level Constraint Mechanism: How to Establish?

    承包制面临的挑战与对策
    孙效良
    承包制正面临着挑战。这主要不是指历来就有的种种非难，而是指由于承包制不完善确实带来了一些新问题。能否解决这些问题，将决定承包制的前途和命运。
  “万岁说”、“取消说”：怎样评说？
    承包制要搞多久？在这个问题上有两种观点，各执一端：一种观点是“万岁说”，另一种观点是“取消说”。
    照我看，承包制是不能万岁的。世界上永恒不变的事物是没有的。尽管有着这样那样的看法，当务之急是如何使承包制进一步完善和发展。
    当前，所以要完善和发展承包制，首先，承包制是治理经济环境的需要。治理环境的中心任务，是改善总供给与总需求的平衡状况，这不仅需要限制需求，也需要增加供给。增加供给不外两种办法：一是增加资金投入以增加生产量。但是，增加资金投入会直接导致增加需求，会使供求矛盾加剧。因此，这种办法不可不用但不可多用。二是改进企业经营机制以提高产出率。这可以在不增加或少增加投入的情况下增加供给，当然是一种理想的办法。实行承包制就是为了改进企业经营机制，因此说它可以为治理环境立汗马功劳。其次，承包制还可以为推出其它改革创造条件。它可以提高经济效益从而改善财政收支状况，它还可以增加紧俏物资的生产从而改善供求状况。这些，都是其它改革（包括价格改革）出台所必需的条件。因此，不要忘记治理环境是为了改革，治理环境也需要改革，承包制在其中可以发挥重要作用。
    说承包制万岁不对，取消承包制又不行，那么，承包制到底需要搞多久？这取决于两个条件：一是承包制本身能够完善到什么程度，如果由于承包制不完善带来的一些新问题总是不能解决，那它只好“退位让贤”了。二是改革的大环境能够发展到什么程度，如果大环境不允许有更好的办法，那只好继续实行承包制。
    “基数法”、“系数法”：怎样选择？
    承包制的效果如何，取决于多种因素，科学地确定财政上交承包指标，在其中有着举足轻重的作用。完善承包制首先要解决这个问题。
    现在确定财政上交指标的办法，可以叫做“基数法”，即以每个企业前一年（或前三年平均）的上交利税为基数，来确定财政上交的承包指标。这种办法有两大问题：一是原来经营好的企业因其基数高承包指标也就高，企业留利反而少；原来经营差的企业因其基数低承包指标也就低，企业留利反而多。这种“鞭打快牛”的结果，不是刺激企业多创利税，而是鼓励企业“留一手”，捞个低基数。现在百分之七八十的企业承包即将到期，如不解决这个问题将会造成严重后果。二是生产价高利大产品的企业，利税增长相对比较容易，生产价低利薄产品的企业，利税增长相对比较困难。在这种情况下，用“基数法”确定承包指标，不仅会由于价格扭曲的干扰，搅乱了企业经营好坏的界限，还会造成留利不公平。
    解决这个问题的办法，就是用“系数法”取代“基数法”来确定财政上交的承包指标。
    经济效益是投入与产出之比。资金利税率可以反映物化劳动的投入与产出之比，工资利税率可以反映活劳动的投入与产出之比。因此，可以用同行业的平均资金利税率和工资利税率，作为反映同行业平均经济效益的指标。
    每个企业的资金利税率与同行业的平均利税率之比，可以叫做“资金效益系数”；每个企业的工资利税率与同行业的平均工资利税率之比，可以叫做“工资效益系数”。为了应用的方便，需要用加权平均的办法，把两个效益系数合为一个“经济效益系数”。根据国家体改委杨团同志的研究，资金效益系数的权数可取0.7，工资效益系数的权数可取0.3。应用这种方法，就可以根据统计数据很方便地计算出每个企业的经济效益系数。其公式为：资金效益系数乘以0.7，加上工资效益系数乘以0.3。从这里可以看出，每个企业的经济效益系数，是用同行业的平均经济效益为尺度衡量每个企业经济效益的定量结果。根据经济效益系数来确定财政上交承包指标，既可以解决“鞭打快牛”问题，还可以在相当大的程度上排除价格扭曲因素的干扰。
    当前完全根据经济效益系数确定财政承包指标，还有一些实际问题要解决，主要是那些经济效益特别低的企业，会由于差距太大而不敢或不愿承包。因此可以采取一种过渡办法，即以经济效益系数为依据，修正根据基数确定的承包指标。这样虽不能彻底解决“鞭打快牛”的问题，但可减轻“鞭打快牛”的程度；而且，在修正承包指标时不是单凭主观意志，而是有了数据作依据。
  短期行为：怎样解决？
    有些企业承包后出现了短期行为，主要表现是，在其它方面的分配与积累发生矛盾时，以其它方面的分配挤积累，减少投入，影响后劲。这也是完善承包制需要解决的一个重要问题。
    如何解决短期行为问题，要分三个层次来研究：
    第一，要区别两种情况。有些企业的短期行为必须解决，有些企业的短期行为不一定需要解决。我们的现存结构并不合理，有些企业本来就是在进行多余的重复生产。这些企业在没有调整产品结构之前，发展后劲大，不仅无益，反而有害。对于这类企业不是解决短期行为的问题，而是调整结构的问题；只有对那些按照产业政策需要发展的企业的短期行为，才必须加以纠正。
    第二，解决需要发展的企业的短期行为问题，有的需要调整政策，有的需要改进承包办法。比如煤炭生产企业，由于定价太低而留利有限，只能在积累和分配当中两头顾一头，通常是顾分配，挤积累。解决这类企业的短期行为，必须调整政策。或者调整价格政策，提高价格；或者调整投资政策，增加投资；或者适当降低企业的承包基数，规定企业留利中用于积累的比例。
    第三，要从承包内容和承包期两个方面改进承包办法。
    短期行为首先与承包内容有关。凡是只承包财政上交任务，并且上交利税增长与工资总额挂钩的企业，就容易产生短期行为。因为承包内容就是鼓励短期行为，而没有约束短期行为。针对这种情况，对于那些需要发展的企业的承包内容，应当实行“两保两挂”，即保证完成实现利税的指标，并与工资总额挂钩；保证完成技术改造计划，并与经营者的奖惩挂钩。这样，就从承包内容上约束了短期行为。
    短期行为与承包期也有关。一般地说，承包期越长，越有利于抑制短期行为。现在多数企业已是三至五年的承包期，但是，一个现代化企业以三至五年为期来规划发展，实是太短；而进一步延长承包期，又会带来新的问题。有些地方正在试行滚动承包，这可能是解决这个矛盾的有益探索。
    “承包制”、“结构优化”：怎样统一？
    调整结构只靠新增投资实行倾斜政策是很不够的，必须使存量资产流动起来。增量资产的倾斜政策与存量资产的流动相结合，才能相得益彰，增强效果。
      但是，承包制却要求每一个企业都要在现有基础上发展、扩大，否则，就完不成承包合同。这样，就使现有结构凝固化了，不能按照产业政策的要求，使存量资产从那些不需要发展的企业流向需要发展的企业。这就是承包制与优化结构的矛盾。
    解决这个矛盾，只从完善承包制本身想办法是没有出路的，必须与企业兼并互相配合，使这个承包制本身无法解决的矛盾，通过企业兼并来解决。
    在这方面，北京市提供了有益的经验。1988年有20个企业没有完成承包合同，其中产品不对路的5个企业由其它企业兼并。一般地说，企业完不成承包合同不外两类原因：一是经营者的问题；二是企业结构的问题。前一类情况要通过再次招标，产生新的经营者来解决。后一类情况，单单更换经营者是不能解决问题的，那就应当实行企业兼并。这样，就很自然地把承包制与企业兼并配合起来了。
    顺便说一下，在一个省、一个市范围内，如果100％的企业都能完成承包合同，不一定是正常情况，有少数企业完不成承包合同倒是正常的。这时，就要具体分析原因，该更换经营者的更换经营者，该被兼并的就要下决心让其它企业兼并。
    企业兼并是个方向。兼并可以用产权转让的形式，也可以用企业承包企业的办法。企业的情况非常复杂，办什么事情都不要搞一刀切。只要有利于产业结构的合理调整，有利于企业经济效益的提高，可以采取多种形式。
    高层次约束机制、低层次约束机制：怎样建立？
    实行承包制以后，企业在分配方面的自主权扩大了，也容易出现滥发多分的现象。有的企业工资和奖金的增长，远远超过了劳动生产率的增长，甚至超过产值的增长。所谓自我约束，主要是指约束这种行为。
    有两类约束办法：一是行政约束；二是机制约束。现在主要是靠行政约束，由上而下地下指标、提要求，进行检查。实践证明，行政约束的作用有限，搞不好还会侵犯企业的自主权，最好是形成企业自我约束的机制。
    低层次的自我约束机制，是工资总额的增长与经济效益挂钩。现行办法是，上交利税增长1％，工资总额增长0.3—0.7％。据了解，凡是实行了这种办法的企业，工资总额的增长普遍低于没有实行这种办法的企业，说明这种办法确实起到了约束作用。但也有两个问题：一是上交利税不是投入产出比，因此并不是反映经济效益的指标，严格讲这不是工资与效益挂钩。二是这种办法是用上交利税的增长约束工资的增长，但上交利税增长多，并不一定是职工的贡献大，因而也不应因此就提高工资。如果改为工资总额的增长与劳动生产率或者工资利税率的提高挂钩，会更好地体现工资与效益挂钩，而且是与活劳动的效益挂钩，约束作用会更大，也更准确。从本质上说，这种办法是把指标约束变为参数约束，仍然带有浓厚的行政约束色彩，所以叫低层次的自我约束机制。
    高层次的自我约束机制，是实行企业自负盈亏。资本主义国家的私营企业自主权相当大，除去在特殊情况下，政府不管它的工资总额，但在分配上并没有普遍发生失去自我约束的情况，原因就在于它是自负盈亏的，只能多赚多拿，少赚少拿。这是一种硬约束。激励机制与约束机制，是互相制衡的两种机制。在我国之所以出现了失去自我约束的情况，根本原因还在于改革不配套，激励机制增强了，而约束机制却相当虚弱，起不到制衡作用。
    因此，真正的自我约束形成之日，只能在企业实行自负盈亏之时。完善承包制，只是深化企业改革中的有限动作，只能要求它达到有限的目标，不能期望过高。
