Shaanxi Province has launched a major campaign to seize and seal harmful books and audio-visual products. The public has widely praised this move, saying that these "spiritual opium" materials, which have been rampant, should be thoroughly cleaned up, just like Lin Zexu's destruction of opium at Humen.

The provincial party committee and government have attached great importance to this action, with the provincial party committee's standing committee holding a special meeting to discuss and deploy the campaign. Over a period of ten days, more than a thousand bookstores and bookstalls were inspected, and 12,080 harmful books were seized and sealed. Additionally, 170,305 books, 39,924 audio tapes, and 21,998 video tapes were sealed for further examination. Some video screening points and equipment were also shut down or sealed. According to relevant departments, out of the 900-plus book distribution points and wholesale units in Xi'an, not a single one was found to be free of harmful and pornographic books. Therefore, Xi'an's cultural market became a key focus of this rectification campaign. The city's party secretary and mayor personally oversaw the operation, with departments such as culture, news, publishing, public security, and commerce working together. While conducting a comprehensive inspection, the focus was on inspecting major book wholesalers in the urban area. Out of the 170,000-plus books seized and sealed across the city, 140,000 were intercepted from these wholesalers. Currently, relevant departments are following the leads to thoroughly investigate the underground printing and distribution networks of pornographic and banned books.

During this campaign, Shaanxi Province strictly adhered to policies and conducted inspections in accordance with the law. Books and publications that are explicitly banned were decisively sealed. For those with unhealthy content but whose nature is difficult to determine, they were temporarily sealed and then reviewed by a team to differentiate and handle accordingly. This approach has gained the support and cooperation of more than 90% of the operators.

    陕西整顿文化市场
    十天查封有害书刊十七万余册
    本报西安7月27日电　记者孟西安报道：陕西省大张旗鼓地收缴查封反动、黄色出版物和音像制品。广大群众说，对于这些泛滥成灾的“精神鸦片”，早该像当年林则徐虎门禁烟一样，来个彻底清扫了！
    省委、省政府很重视这次行动，省委常委会专门讨论，统一部署。10天时间内，检查书店、书摊上千家，查禁有害书刊12080册；封存待查书刊170305册，录音带39924盒，录像带21998盘。还取缔或封存了一些录像放映点和设备。据有关部门统计，西安市900多个书刊发行网点和批发单位，没有一家不经营黄色有害书刊。因此，西安文化市场成为这次整顿中的重点。市委书记、市长亲自抓，文化、新闻、出版、公安、工商等部门一起出动。在全面清查的同时，突出清查城区书刊批发经营大户。在全市收缴、封存的17万多册书刊中，就有14万多册是从批发大户堵截的。目前，有关部门正顺藤摸瓜，深挖黄色、违禁书刊的地下印刷、发行网。
    陕西省在这次行动中，严格掌握政策，依法进行检查，对于明令禁止的书刊和非法出版物坚决查封。对有不健康内容，性质一时难以确定的，先暂时封存，然后组织力量审读，区别处理。这样做，得到了90％以上经营户的支持与配合。
