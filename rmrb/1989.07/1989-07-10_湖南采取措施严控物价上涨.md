Hunan Takes Measures to Strictly Control Price Increases

XINHUA, Changsha, July 10th — The Hunan Provincial Government has taken measures to continue strictly controlling price increases.

Since the beginning of this year, the market prices in Hunan Province have shown signs of easing, with the increase rate dropping from 30.8% in January to 24.2% in May. However, there are still many factors driving market price increases. To implement the instructions of the State Council and continue to strictly control price increases, the Hunan Provincial Government has taken the following measures:

1. Strengthen the leadership over price work, intensify price management, and resolutely not implement price increase measures.

2. Stabilize the prices of the "vegetable basket," maintain the area of vegetable cultivation, and organize balanced market supply; continue to implement various supportive policies for pig production, and smoothen the channels for purchase and sales. The retail price of pork in state-owned meat stores in prefecture-level cities will be maintained at 2.5 yuan for 500 grams of frozen pork and 2.8 yuan for fresh pork, with the increased losses in the meat sector covered by fiscal subsidies; strengthen the management of prices for soy products, catering, and pastries after grain pressure sales, and prevent price surges.

3. Do everything possible to control the prices of agricultural production materials. The prices of major agricultural production materials such as fertilizers and pesticides will not be allowed to increase in the coming months.

4. Strictly manage the prices of daily industrial consumer goods and various charging standards. Ensure the production and supply of commodities such as sugar, soap, and salt, and maintain stable prices. Charges for public utilities and service industries closely related to people's lives will not be allowed to increase.

5. Clean up and immediately correct any unauthorized price increases that have occurred this year; continue to pursue responsibility for any further unauthorized price increases; and swiftly and decisively expose and crack down on those who take advantage of the chaos to inflate prices, impose unauthorized charges, spread rumors, and disrupt market order.

    湖南采取措施严控物价上涨
    本报长沙7月10日电　记者吴兴华报道：湖南省政府采取措施，继续严格控制物价上涨。
    今年以来，湖南省市场物价趋缓，涨幅已由1月的30.8％回落到5月的24.2％。但是，当前促使市场物价上涨的因素很多。为了落实国务院有关指示精神，继续严格控制物价上涨，湖南省政府采取了下列措施：
    一、切实加强对物价工作的领导，强化物价管理，坚决不出台涨价措施。
    二、稳住“菜篮子”价格，稳定蔬菜种植面积，组织均衡上市；继续落实各项扶持发展生猪生产的政策措施，疏通购销渠道。省辖市的国营肉店猪肉零售价维持在500克冻肉2.5元，鲜肉2.8元的水平，肉食部门增加的亏损由财政补贴；加强粮食压销后的豆制品、饮食、糕点价格的管理，防止价格暴涨。
    三、千方百计控制农业生产资料价格。今后几个月化肥、农药等主要农业生产资料价格一律不准再涨。
    四、严格管好日用工业消费品价格和各项收费标准。抓好食糖、肥皂、食盐等商品生产和供应，保持价格的稳定。同群众生活密切相关的公用事业和服务行业收费，一律不准再提高。
    五、对今年以来的越权提价进行清理，并立即纠正；继续越权提价的要追究领导的责任；对趁动乱哄抬物价，乱收费用，制造谣言、扰乱市场秩序的破坏分子，要迅速果断地揭露和打击。
