    Heilongjiang Summarizes Experiences in University Ideological and Political Work: Ideological Education is Crucial, Political Workers Need Support

    People's Daily, Harbin, July 26 (Reporter Wu Peizhen) Where there is a strong team of political workers, ideological and political work is effective, and stability is relatively good. The border province of Heilongjiang has summarized its experiences in strengthening ideological and political work in universities and decided to further strengthen and improve the team of full-time political workers in universities, giving full play to their important role in teaching and educating people.

    Since 1985, the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee has insisted on treating ideological and political work in universities as a major task, stressing the need to occupy the school's ideological battlefield with Marxism. Ideological and political work can only be strengthened, not relaxed. They have worked hard to eliminate various interferences, insisting on the specialization of political workers, and maintaining a full set of personnel from party committee secretaries, branch secretaries to grade counselors and class advisors.

    At the beginning of this year's student unrest, all members of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Standing Committee, the governor, and deputy governors took action, each taking charge of a university, and had multiple discussions with teachers and students, resolving many conflicts within the campus.

    The team of political workers active in universities across the province has been working hard to explore the laws and methods of ideological and political work in the new era, changing the method of filling students' minds with ideas. They do their work according to the students' ideological characteristics. They make friends with students and guide them patiently. The party committee secretary of Harbin Medical University, Cheng Sixi, visited over 300 student dormitories in half a year and had talks with half of the students in the school. Grade counselors in various universities have long been living in student dormitories. When students start school, they go to greet them; when they do morning exercises, they arrive earlier than the students; when students are sick, they send meals and medicine, and even carry students to the hospital like they would their younger siblings. Their extensive and detailed ideological work has solved many problems in their infancy. During this student unrest, they effectively cooperated with the party, government, and school leaders to persuade students back from the train stations, government buildings, and busy streets. Throughout the unrest, roadblocks in Heilongjiang lasted only three days, and students returned to class relatively quickly.

    Speaking of this, Vice Governor Huang Feng, who is in charge of education and culture, praised the team of political workers in Heilongjiang universities as capable and having played an important role. However, he also expressed some concerns, pointing out that to make students establish a correct worldview and outlook on life, to make some students change their mindset of "60 is the pass mark" and always wanting to stay in big cities after graduation and be infatuated with going abroad, and to raise their awareness to serve the organization's allocation and go to the places where the country needs them the most and where it is the hardest, is a very arduous task. Meanwhile, the current political work team also has some problems that are quite common. First, the team of full-time political workers is unstable and needs to be stabilized. It is necessary to clarify the appropriate position of ideological and political work, to support political workers in public opinion, to give them a sense of honor and pride. Second, the quality of professional political workers needs to be improved. Political workers not only need to have high ideals, morals, and sentiments but also need to have rich knowledge so that they can have higher prestige among students.

    Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Sun Weiben believes that strengthening the construction of the team of political workers in universities must solve the problem of treating political workers equally in terms of treatment with professional personnel. To effectively solve the problem of the source of political workers and give full play to the role of all teachers in teaching and educating people, the provincial government proposed that newly appointed university teachers should first serve as student counselors for two years and then teach. This proposal has been approved by various universities.

### 黑龙江总结高校思想政治工作经验  思想教育很重要　政工干部需支持

    黑龙江总结高校思想政治工作经验
    思想教育很重要　政工干部需支持
    本报哈尔滨电　记者武培真报道：哪里的政工干部队伍坚强，思想政治工作得力，哪里就比较稳定。地处边陲的黑龙江省通过总结在高校中加强思想政治工作的经验，决定进一步对高校专职政工干部队伍充实提高，发挥他们在教书育人中的重要作用。
    1985年以来，黑龙江省委坚持把高校的思想政治工作当作大事来抓，强调要用马克思主义占领学校阵地，思想政治工作只能加强，不能放松。他们努力排除种种干扰，坚持政工干部专职化，保持了从党委书记、总支书记到年级辅导员和班主任的全套人马。
    今年学潮一开始，黑龙江省委常委、省长、副省长全体出动，各包一所高校，多次与师生交谈，使许多矛盾解决在校园之中。
    活跃在全省高校中的政工干部队伍，努力探索新时期思想政治工作的规律和方法，改变填鸭式的思想灌输，根据学生的思想特点做工作。他们与学生广交朋友，循循善诱。哈医大党委书记程锡绎，半年中走遍300多个学生宿舍，与全校半数学生进行了谈话。各高校的年级辅导员，长期住在学生宿舍。学生开学，他们去迎接；出早操，比学生到得早；学生病了，他们送饭送药，甚至像对弟妹一样把学生背到医院。他们大量过细的思想工作，使很多问题解决在苗头状态。在这次学潮中，又是他们有效地配合党和政府及学校领导把学生从车站、政府门前和闹市街头劝回。整个学潮期间，黑龙江境内的路障只维持了3天，学生复课也比较快。
    谈到这件事，分管文教工作的副省长黄枫，称赞黑龙江高校政工干部队伍是得力的，发挥了重要作用。但他又不无忧虑地指出，要使学生树立正确的世界观、人生观，使一些学生改变“60分万岁”和总想毕业后留大城市并迷恋着出国的偏向，把觉悟提高到服从组织分配，到祖国最需要、最艰苦的地方去，则是一件相当艰巨的工作。而目前的政工队伍也存在一些带有普遍性的问题。一是专职政工干部队伍人心思动，急需稳定。必须明确思想政治工作的恰当地位，从舆论上为政工人员撑腰、正名，加强他们的荣誉感、自豪感。二是专业政工干部队伍素质有待提高。政工干部不仅要有高尚的思想、道德、情操，还需要有丰富的知识，这样才能在学生中有较高威信。
    省委书记孙维本认为，加强高校政工干部队伍建设，一定要设法解决政工干部在待遇上与专业人员一视同仁的问题。为了切实解决政工干部的来源问题，发挥所有教师教书育人的作用，省政府提议，新上任的大学教师，先担任两年学生辅导员，然后再教书。这一提议，已得到各大学的赞同。
