Only Socialism Can Develop China

In a recent important speech, Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: If we do not adhere to socialism, even if we eventually develop, we will only become a dependent country, and it will not be easy to develop. Only socialism can save China, and only socialism can develop China. This counter-revolutionary riot has given us great enlightenment and is of great importance, making our minds clearer. If China does not follow the socialist path, it will have no future.

Only socialism can develop China. This is a new conclusion drawn by Comrade Deng Xiaoping after summarizing China's 40 years of socialist construction, especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. At this time of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, it is important to seriously study and understand this conclusion. This will help us calmly summarize the past and firmly create the future.

In recent years, some comrades have not emphasized the struggle between socialism and capitalism, as if in a wave of "relaxation," the boundaries between socialism and capitalism have disappeared and merged. In fact, this is not the case. Soon after China crushed the Gang of Four, a bourgeois liberalization trend emerged, denying socialism. Over the past decade, this trend has not only not been curbed but has instead grown more rampant, eventually becoming a disaster. Some people have become increasingly brazen in their opposition to socialism, openly declaring that the attempt and failure of socialism is a major legacy of the 20th century. They use various means to widely propagate that the socialist system is an obstacle to China's development, claiming that socialism can only lead to stagnation and that only the capitalist system can make China take off. Therefore, they repeatedly advocate for private ownership and the separation of powers, even publishing a "Declaration of Private Ownership," attempting to replace China's socialist system with a capitalist one. These people also disguise various anti-socialist fallacies as "reforms" and spread them widely, causing considerable confusion. What is even more serious is that they have received support from within the Party. In early 1987, Comrade Zhao Ziyang openly proposed at a Party meeting that in the future, the four cardinal principles would mainly be about adhering to the Party's leadership, and the other three could be mentioned less or not at all. At that time, some comrades pointed out the need to emphasize socialism, but he said that no one can clearly explain what the socialist path is now. Is this not encouraging the anti-socialist trend in society? If it is not for building socialism in China, what is the meaning of adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party?

This anti-socialist trend is linked to the international climate. For a period, some political forces in capitalist countries have used the twists and turns of the international communist movement and the difficulties in the construction of socialist countries to make a big deal out of the supposed "crisis" of socialism and to denigrate Marxism as "outdated." They vigorously promote the strategy of "peaceful evolution" and "victory without war" against socialist countries, using various channels to infiltrate socialist countries with ideological and political influence, supporting and fostering various anti-socialist activities, and causing the trend of "socialism is not as good as capitalism" to spread widely internationally.

After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee solved the problems within the Party, everyone saw more clearly: The occurrence of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing is precisely the result of the long-term interaction and malignant development of various anti-socialist trends within and outside the Party, both domestically and internationally. Now, the bloody and fiery price has opened people's eyes. Through this negative example from political turmoil to counter-revolutionary riot, people have received a profound education that only socialism can develop China.

Only socialism can develop China because the replacement of capitalism by socialism is an objective law of social development that is not subject to human will. In China, the establishment of a socialist system with public ownership as the mainstay has fundamentally changed the position of the Chinese people, who have been exploited, oppressed, and enslaved for thousands of years, making the working people the masters of the country. It is precisely because of this fundamental change that in just 40 years, China has built itself into a relatively prosperous and powerful country. The socialist system and spirit have taken root, sprouted, blossomed, and borne fruit on Chinese soil, and have withstood one storm after another, becoming an integral part of people's lives, inseparable for a moment. Some young people only see the problems and difficulties in the process of socialist development and do not see the great efforts and sacrifices the Chinese people have made to establish the socialist system. They do not see the great achievements that socialism has brought to China and do not see the strong vitality of socialism in China. This is because they do not understand China's history and do not understand the reality of the world. In the past hundred years, China has also tried the capitalist path, but this path does not work in China. Those developed capitalist countries did not genuinely help China walk the capitalist path but wanted to turn China into their dependent country or colony. Therefore, the old China became increasingly backward, to the point of being derided by the world as the "Sick Man of East Asia." Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Chinese people chose the socialist path, and China gradually became prosperous and strong. Now, China's gross national product ranks eighth in the world. But because China's population is too large, it is still among the poor countries in terms of per capita income. We must strive to build and develop faster. To develop, we must have a stable social environment. If we are constantly in turmoil and dealing with turmoil, where will we find the energy to build, and how can we develop? The political turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot with the main goal of denying socialism have caused tremendous visible and invisible damage to the country, which is a living example. In a state of no peace for the people and no peace for the country, production cannot proceed normally, the economy cannot prosper, national strength cannot be enhanced, and people's lives cannot be improved. This painful lesson must never be forgotten.

For a country to break free from foreign oppression and achieve independence and self-reliance is a prerequisite for development. Although China is still a poor country today, it plays a significant role in the world. Why is this so? The most fundamental reason is that we adhere to the socialist path and are an independent and self-reliant great power. The goal of a few people who incited political turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots is, with the support of certain foreign forces, to turn China into a completely dependent bourgeois republic of the West. If their plot succeeds, we will only be able to act according to the wishes of others, where will our independence be? Before liberation, although China was also a great power, it was dependent on others in everything and could only be bullied. Older people and those who have studied modern Chinese history should remember that in the parks on Chinese soil, there were once signs that read "No Chinese and dogs allowed." Even the qualification to be human was not recognized, so how could we talk about construction and development? History tells us that only by adhering to socialism can we have independence and self-reliance. Only on this basis can we seek development, and China will have a true future.

Socialism has strong vitality because socialism is not a rigid model but a body with the ability to develop and improve itself. To say that the socialist path is unclear now is to deny the basic theory and basic practice of scientific socialism. Some people use the excuse that socialism needs reform and exploration to oppose the socialist path. We, on the other hand, emphasize that under the premise of adhering to the basic principles of socialism, we must continuously improve and develop the socialist system. This self-development and self-improvement path is reform. Socialism is an unprecedented undertaking in the world, having appeared for only a few decades, and it is inevitable that there will be detours and setbacks in the process of practice, and there are still various problems now. We must eliminate evils and better utilize the superiority of the socialist system through reform. China's economic system reform over the past decade has changed the economic and social life of China, injected vigorous vitality into China's socialist cause, and achieved successful experience. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of the country. Reform and opening up are the path to a strong country. We must criticize bourgeois liberalization while adhering to reform and opening up. In this way, socialist China will be more attractive.

To adhere to socialism and develop China, we must also vigorously develop socialist democracy. The socialist cause is the cause of millions of people, and without the initiative, creativity, and sense of responsibility of the people, the socialist cause cannot develop. The core of socialist democracy is that the people are the masters of the country, and a system of people managing the state should be established and developed. Strengthening the construction of socialist democracy is the wish of the broad masses, including young students, and is also the goal of our Party's struggle. We should promote political system reform and the development of socialist democracy with an active and enterprising spirit. However, the path to developing democracy should be advanced step by step under the leadership of the Party and should be beneficial to social stability, and it should not be adopted in a lawless manner to create turmoil. Creating turmoil is precisely the destruction of democratic construction, and the result is not the perfection and development of socialism but the weakening and shaking of socialism. The events that occurred in Beijing this time are a powerful proof of this.

In the current situation where science and technology are developing rapidly and competition is becoming increasingly fierce, every Chinese person who loves their country hopes that the motherland will develop faster. However, the question of which path to take to make China develop faster is indeed worth a deep consideration in light of the current struggle. History and reality have given the answer, which is: Only socialism can develop China. We believe that after calm reflection, those who truly love their country will firmly hold this belief.

### 只有社会主义才能发展中国

    只有社会主义才能发展中国
    邓小平同志在最近的一次重要谈话中指出：如果我们不坚持社会主义，最终发展起来也不过成为一个附庸国，而且就连想要发展起来也不容易。只有社会主义才能救中国，只有社会主义才能发展中国。在这一点上，这次暴乱对我们的启发十分大，十分重要，使我们的头脑更加清醒起来。不走社会主义道路中国就没有前途。
    只有社会主义才能发展中国，这是邓小平同志总结了我国40年来，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来社会主义建设实践之后作出的新的论断。在平息反革命暴乱之际，认真学习领会这个论断，对于我们冷静地总结过去，坚定地开创未来，有极其重要的意义。
    近几年来，我们有些同志对于社会主义和资本主义的斗争不大讲了，似乎在一片“缓和”声中，社会主义和资本主义的界限消失了、融解了。其实，事实决非如此。我国粉碎“四人帮”不久，就出现了一股否定社会主义的资产阶级自由化思潮。十年来，这股逆流不但没有得到遏制，相反地却愈益发展，终于泛滥成灾。有些人反对社会主义越来越猖狂，他们公开宣称：社会主义的尝试和失败是20世纪的一大遗产。他们通过各种方式广泛地宣传社会主义制度是中国发展的绊脚石，说社会主义只能导致缓慢和停滞，只有资本主义那一套才能使中国起飞。因此，他们一再公开鼓吹私有制和三权分立，甚至公开发表《私有制宣言》，企图用资本主义制度取代我国的社会主义制度。这些人还把种种否定社会主义的谬论披上“改革”的外衣大肆散布，造成了相当的思想混乱。尤为严重的是，他们还得到了来自党内的支持。1987年初，赵紫阳同志在党内一次会议上公然提出，今后四个坚持主要是坚持党的领导，其他三项可以不提或者少提。当时就有同志提出必须强调社会主义，他竟说，什么是社会主义道路现在谁也讲不清。这岂不是在纵容社会上那股否定社会主义的思潮吗？如果不是为了在中国建设社会主义，坚持共产党的领导又有什么意义？
    这股否定社会主义的逆流是同国际大气候相联系着的。一段时间以来，一些资本主义国家的政治势力，利用国际共产主义运动的曲折和社会主义国家建设过程中的困难大作文章。他们渲染社会主义的所谓“危机”，诋毁马克思主义已经“过时”。他们大力推行对社会主义“和平演变”、“不战而胜”的策略，通过各种渠道对社会主义国家进行思想、政治渗透，支持和助长各种反社会主义活动的发展，造成了国际上“社会主义不如资本主义”的思潮相当严重地泛滥开来。
    党的十三届四中全会解决了党内问题之后，大家就看得更清楚了：北京这场反革命暴乱的发生，正是由于长期以来国内外、党内外各种否定社会主义的思潮交相作用、恶性发展的结果。现在，血与火的巨大代价擦亮了人们的眼睛。人们通过从政治动乱到反革命暴乱这个反面教材，受到了一次极其深刻的只有社会主义才能发展中国的教育。
    只有社会主义才能发展中国，是因为社会主义取代资本主义是社会发展的客观规律，不以人的意志为转移。在我国，以公有制为主体的社会主义制度的建立，第一次从根本上改变了几千年来中国人民受剥削、遭压迫、被奴役的地位，使劳动人民当家做了主人。正是由于这个根本变化，短短40年，中国已经建设成一个初步繁荣富强的国家。社会主义的制度和精神，已经在中国大地上生根、发芽、开花、结果，并且经受住了一次又一次风雨的考验，和人民的生活融为了一体，须臾不可分离。有些年轻人，只看到了社会主义发展过程中的问题和困难，而没有看到为了建立社会主义制度中国人民作出了多大的努力和牺牲，没有看到社会主义给中国带来的巨大成就，没有看到社会主义在中国强盛的生命力。这是因为他们不了解中国的历史，也不了解世界的现实。近百年来，中国也曾经走过资本主义道路，但这条道路在中国走不通。那些发达的资本主义国家并不是真心帮助中国走资本主义道路，而是要把中国变成他们的附庸国、殖民地。所以，旧中国越来越落后，以致被世人贬之为“东亚病夫”。中国人民在中国共产党的领导下，选择了社会主义道路，中国才逐步地富强起来，现在国民生产总值已经占居世界第八位。但因为中国的人口太多，按人平均还属于穷国之列。我们必须努力建设，加快发展。要发展，就必须有一个稳定的社会环境。如果成天搞动乱和处理动乱，哪有精力搞建设，怎么可能有发展？这场以否定社会主义为主要目标的政治动乱和反革命暴乱给国家造成的有形的无形的巨大破坏，就是活生生的例子。在民无宁日、国无宁日的状况下，生产不可能正常进行，经济不可能繁荣，国家力量不可能增强，人民生活不可能改善。这个惨痛的教训，永远也不能忘记。
    一个国家摆脱外来奴役，实现独立自主，是发展的前提。现在中国虽然还是穷国，但今天在世界上发挥着举足轻重的影响。为什么会有这么大的影响？最根本的一条，是因为我们坚持走社会主义道路，是个独立自主的大国。极少数煽动政治动乱和反革命暴乱的人的目的，是在某些外国势力的支持下，要把中国变成一个完全附庸西方的资产阶级共和国。如果他们的阴谋得逞，我们就只能是看着别人的脸色行事，哪还有什么独立性？解放前，中国虽然也是大国，但事事仰人鼻息，只能被人欺凌。年纪较大的人和学过中国近代史的人，都应该记得在中国土地上的公园里，曾经挂过“华人与狗不得入内”的牌子。连做人的资格都没有，建设、发展从何谈起？历史告诉我们，只有坚持社会主义，才有独立自主。只有在这个基础上求发展，中国才有真正的前途。
    社会主义之所以有强大的生命力，还因为社会主义并不是一个僵化的模式，而是一个具有自我发展、自我完善能力的肌体。说什么社会主义道路现在谁也讲不清，这就等于否定科学社会主义的基本理论和基本实践。有一些人就是借口社会主义要改革、要探索，而反对坚持社会主义道路的。我们则相反，强调在坚持社会主义基本原则的前提下，不断完善和发展社会主义制度。这种自我发展自我完善的途径就是改革。社会主义是前无古人的事业，在世界上出现才仅仅几十年的时间，实践过程中难免会有迂回和挫折，现在也还有这样那样的弊病。我们就是要通过改革，兴利除弊，更好地发挥社会主义制度的优越性。我国十年来的经济体制改革，改变了中国的经济和社会生活面貌，为中国的社会主义事业注入了蓬勃的生机和活力，取得了成功的经验。四项基本原则是立国之本。改革开放是强国之路。我们要在批判资产阶级自由化的同时，坚持改革开放。这样，社会主义的中国就会更具有吸引力。
    坚持社会主义发展中国，包括要大力发展社会主义民主。社会主义事业是千百万人民群众的事业，没有人民群众的积极性、创造性和主人翁责任感，社会主义事业就无从发展。社会主义民主的核心，是人民当家做主，建立和发展人民管理国家的制度。加强社会主义民主建设，是广大群众包括青年学生的愿望，也是我们党奋斗的目标。我们应该以积极进取的精神推进政治体制改革，推进社会主义民主的发展。但是，发展民主的途径，应该在党的领导下一步一步地前进，应该有利于社会的稳定，决不应该采取“无法无天”搞动乱的方式。搞动乱，恰恰是破坏了民主建设，结果不是完善和发展社会主义，而是削弱、动摇社会主义。这次在北京发生的事件，就是有力的证明。
    在当前世界科技日益发展、竞争日趋激烈的形势下，每一个有爱国之心的中国人都盼望祖国发展得更快一点。但是，究竟走什么道路才能使中国更快地发展起来，确实值得人们结合当前这场斗争的实际做一番深入的思考。历史和现实的经验教训已经做出了回答，这就是：只有社会主义才能发展中国。我们相信，真正有爱国之心的人，通过冷静的思考之后，都会坚定这个信念。
