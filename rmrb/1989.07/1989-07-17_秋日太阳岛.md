	Autumn Sun Island
	Hou Chusheng

	By chance, I met three Japanese friends on a train. At their request, I guided them to visit Sun Island in autumn.

	In the early morning, a thin mist covered the river surface, like a light silk veil, adding a layer of mystery to the Songhua River. Gazing into the distance, Sun Island appeared and disappeared, like a shy maiden waking from a dream, hiding herself away. Through the veil, a few points of white light still shone, which were a few Russian-style houses hidden in the gray foliage.

	On the river, speedboats rushed past, causing the autumn water to ripple with waves, layer upon layer, spreading out until they reached our feet, as if stretching out wave-like arms to welcome distant guests.

	Near the shore, the branches of the elm trees stretched out golden leaves, rustling a melody of "sand sand," generously offering the passion of northern autumn.

	Looking through the branches, the small island, the river, the trees, and the small boats were all embedded within, like a giant, luxurious curtain with a "elm branches and river sky" painting.

	Stepping off the ferry and onto the circular island road, I saw golden leaves everywhere. Whether it was the ruthless autumn wind or the falling leaves returning to their roots, the remaining green on the branches and the yellow leaves on the ground presented the philosophy of life and nature, making one feel deeply moved.

	On both sides of the road, there were willows on one side and poplars on the other. They seemed to pay no heed to the loneliness of autumn or the harshness of the wind, still humming softly and dancing gracefully. A few red leaves sprouting from the grass, raised a few flames of hope, as if determined to burn the fire of life to the very last moment.

	Walking down the stone steps, the wind suddenly stopped. The embankment and the area below seemed to be two different worlds: one noisy, one tranquil; one gentle, one wild. It made one doubt whether the sudden change in the world was real.

	There was a path covered by an arched grape trellis. Walking underneath, one was pressed down by the withered branches and fallen leaves surrounding them.

	I did not understand how the alternation of life and death, and the intermingling of decay and glory, could be so cruel. If spring is supposed to be a sea of green, then after offering its fruits and seeds, autumn should indeed be a sea of yellow. “Old age is not to be regretted, youth is still to be awaited!” A Japanese friend’s words indeed pointed out an attitude towards life.

	Climbing up to "Water Pavilion Sky," looking out from the platform, the white pavilion at the top of the artificial hill first caught the eye. Below the pavilion, the rugged and steep artificial hill was filled with towering rocks, layer upon layer, outlining a busy yet orderly, elegant and pleasant ink painting. The willows planted around the hill added a golden frame to this painting. From the pavilion to the hill, from the hill to the willows, and then from the willows to the lake, looking one after another, the autumn water in the lake shimmered with ripples, sparkling brightly. The autumn wind picked up, ruffling the lake; the slanting autumn sun stirred the reflections of the pavilions and towers in the water. Looking at this Sun Lake, one truly did not know whether one was in the painting or whether the painting was to one's liking!

	Climbing up to the white pavilion, looking down from the artificial hill, the view suddenly opened up. The distant trees, the nearby lake, the river and the sky, the vast earth, all at once became expansive. The height of the sky, the grandeur of the earth, the twists and turns of the river, the gentleness of the water, all were within sight, making one marvel at the creator's incredible power, shaping each object in nature so distinctly. Although each had its own unique charm, thick or thin, when combined together, they showed perfect harmony, just like how people, despite their differences, can live together harmoniously on the same earth.

	The three Japanese friends listened to my comments and could not help but laugh.

	Walking back, crossing the small stone bridge, a small pavilion at a fork in the road appeared before my eyes. The autumn colors were deep, the journey was long, and the parting was imminent, a sense of confusion crept into my heart. The paths were meant to diverge; the people were meant to part. It was just that the parting should not be so hurried. Thus, they began to talk about a small flower that blooms in the spring in Japan. It blooms magnificently and passionately, and when the spring breeze blows, it blooms all over the mountains. Because it blooms so beautifully and attracts so much attention, its falling is hardly noticed. Perhaps it only blooms and does not fall. Perhaps, in this world, there truly is a flower that blooms forever and stays young forever.

    秋日太阳岛
    侯滁生
    一个偶然的机会，我在火车上结识了三位日本朋友。应他们的请求，由我引路，一起去游秋天的太阳岛。
    清晨，薄雾笼罩着江面，如万丈轻纱，给松花江添了层迷离的韵致。极目远观，太阳岛时隐时现，如梦中初醒的少女，羞答答地将自己遮起来。轻纱中，尚闪出几点白色的亮光，那是隐在灰色树丛中的几座俄式小房。
    江面上，快艇飞驰而过，于是，那一江秋水便翻起朵朵浪花，且一层层展开，漫过来，直到我们的脚下，似在伸出浪的手臂，欢迎远方的客人。
    近处岸边的榆树枝条，则伸开金黄的叶子，摇出一支“沙沙”的乐曲，将北国深秋的热情，无私地奉献出来。
    透过枝条望去，小岛、江面、树木、小艇，都嵌在其中，犹如巨大富丽的窗帘上，缀了幅“榆枝江天”的画。
    走下渡船，踏上环岛公路，只见满地金黄。不知是秋风的无情，还是落叶要归根。枝头仍存的嫩绿，地上满铺的苍黄，将万物和人生的哲理摆在我们面前，令人感慨万端。
    路两旁，一边是垂柳，一边是白杨。它们好像全不顾秋的寂寞；风的冷峻，仍在低吟浅唱，婆娑起舞。那从杂草间隙中拔地而起的一两枝红叶，奋力扬起几把希望的火苗，仿佛要把生命之火烧到最后一刻。
    下了石阶，风，一下子住了。堤上与堤下，似乎全然是两个世界：一个喧哗，一个恬静；一个温柔，一个狂躁。让人怀疑，这眼前突变的世界是不是真的。
    有一段小路，是被拱形的葡萄架遮住的。走在下面，便被四周缠绕的枯枝、败叶压住了。
    我不明白，这生与死的交替，败与荣的错落，竟是如此的残酷。如果说，春天本该是一片翠绿的话，那么，将果实和种籽奉献过后，秋天也本该是一片苍黄了。“暮年不足惜，青春尚可待呀！”日本朋友的一句话，倒点出了人生的一种态度。
    登上“水阁云天”，凭台远眺，位于假山顶端的白亭首先映入眼帘。亭下面嵯峨险峻的假山上怪石林立，重重叠叠，勾勒出一幅繁而不乱、清雅宜人的水墨画。围山而栽的秋天之柳，又为这幅画嵌了圈金色的环。由亭而山，由山而柳，再由柳而湖，次第看去，那一汪秋水，滟滟生波，耀耀生粼。秋风乍起，将一湖秋水吹皱；秋阳斜照，搅亭台楼阁倒影于一身。看着这太阳湖，真不知是人在画中，还是画尽人意了！
    登上白亭，从假山上往下看去，眼前便豁然开阔。那远树，近湖，江天，大地，都一下子朗阔起来。天的高远，地的壮阔，江的曲折，水的温柔，尽收眼底，使人赞叹造物主竟有如此的神力，将大自然中每样物体的性格，塑造得那样迥异。然而，虽各具千秋，厚薄有别，搭配在一起，却又显出万分的和谐，就如同人的千差万别，却能同生于一个地球上和睦相处一样。
    三位日本朋友听了我的议论，都禁不住笑了。
    踏上归途，走上那座石板小桥，见一个分岔的小亭横在眼前。秋色已深，路程尚远，分别在即，一丝迷茫爬上心头。路，本是要分的；人，也本是要分的。只是不要分得那么匆忙。于是，他们便说起了日本春天里开的一种小花。它开得烂漫，开得热烈，每当春风吹过的时候，它便漫山遍野地开起来。只因为它开得那么引人，那么注目，于是，它的零落倒无人记起了。也许，它只会盛开，不会零落的吧！也许，这个世界上，真有那种四季长在，青春永驻的花吧！
