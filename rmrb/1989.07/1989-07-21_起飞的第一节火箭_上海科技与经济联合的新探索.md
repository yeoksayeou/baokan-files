A high-tech program-controlled telephone set, included in Shanghai's research and development plan, has seen continuous breakthroughs in technical difficulties. Last winter, the production of this telephone set exceeded the plan by 10,000 units. Experts predict that the original plan to complete 300,000 telephone sets by 1990 can be achieved a year ahead of schedule.

The program-controlled telephone is one of Shanghai's 14 major research and development projects. Together with other projects, it serves as a new growth point for scientific research to penetrate production, painting a new picture for Shanghai's economic takeoff.

The Choice After Losing the Crown

As China's largest industrial base, Shanghai once held the crown for the country's total national production, industrial output, and export trade. However, after the reforms, Shanghai people found that Shanghai was no longer the dominant "big brother." Several crowns have fallen, and Shanghai's economic development has fallen into a predicament: on one hand, there is an advantage in scientific research, but on the other hand, production is lagging behind.

Shanghai has a strong scientific research foundation, with over 400,000 scientific and technological personnel, whose overall strength far surpasses that of the "Four Little Dragons" in Asia. In recent years, Shanghai has done a lot of work in promoting production through science and technology, such as opening technology markets, linking factories and research institutes to transfer results, and sending scientific researchers to the countryside to manage township enterprises, which have had some effect. However, the gap between science and technology and production has not been bridged, especially hindering the transformation of scientific and technological achievements into large and medium-sized enterprises, causing some key industries to "age before their time."

The lack of a benign operating mechanism between scientific research and production is the main cause of this problem. Relevant data shows that Shanghai's scientific research and enterprises are seriously disconnected. Currently, more than half of Shanghai's research institutes, 80% of scientific researchers, and about half of the scientific research funds are outside the enterprises, resulting in a large number of achievements being shelved in the laboratory. Key enterprises' technical difficulties cannot be solved in a timely manner, and enterprises' technical development funds cannot be guaranteed, causing economic growth to slow down.

Thus, Shanghai's leaders began to search for a new scientific research operation mechanism.

Last June, a report on how to leverage scientific and technological advantages was submitted to the municipal Party secretary Jiang Zemin and mayor Zhu Rongji. The report, which incorporated the opinions of hundreds of experts, proposed a new idea: using major projects as a bridge, combining economic and legal means to connect scientific research forces with enterprises, and jointly overcoming technical difficulties in large and medium-sized enterprises. The goal is to achieve major technological breakthroughs within two to three years, drive product structure adjustments, and drive economic takeoff.

To improve the efficiency of scientific research and development, experts also suggested that major projects should be led by a unified leadership; factories and research institutes should jointly tackle key problems, with factories taking the lead, and research institutes responsible for breaking through technical difficulties. Factories should provide research and development funds and industrialize the technology; the research and development process should introduce a competitive mechanism, and projects should be publicly bid, with winning bids signing economic contracts and being certified by legal departments.

This new plan for scientific research to integrate with production was immediately approved by the municipal government. After verifying several dozen industrial departments and thousands of large and medium-sized enterprises, 14 major research and development projects were quickly selected and included in Shanghai's first research and development campaign.

An Irresistible "Magnetic Effect"

Opening the project list, the following projects stand out: Santana car domestication, microcomputers, supercritical power generation units, fiber optics communication, 300,000-ton ethylene and ammonia synthesis equipment domestication, multifunctional coated composite fabrics, 600,000-kilowatt nuclear power equipment development...

The research and development team led by Mayor Zhu Rongji was established, and the battle to jointly tackle key problems by research institutes, universities, and related enterprises began.

On September 27, 1988, 136 sub-projects were split from the 14 projects and publicly bid for the first time across the city. Over 900 bids were submitted by scientific researchers from 500 research institutes, universities, and enterprises in Shanghai. In the final 98 winning bids, over 2,000 scientific and technological personnel participated in the research and development, including 400 researchers, professors, and senior engineers. On May 27 this year, Shanghai publicly bid for 72 more projects, and the bidders were still numerous.

Major projects attract scientists like a magnet. Lin Guoqiang, deputy director of the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences, said: In the past, we were called to enter the "main battlefield," but there were no channels, and the "owner" seemed not to need us urgently. Now, with the focus on key projects, we have a competitive arena where we can fully display our scientific and technological talents. Everyone wants to compete. This institute participated in two bids and won 15 projects. Currently, the research workload of 70 scientific researchers has increased by 1/3 or 1/4 compared to previous years.

Winning projects, due to the implementation of the contract responsibility system, strive to avoid "lawsuits" and work day and night to fulfill their contracts on time. A three-person project team developed a special photosensitive material for a factory, with the contract stipulating delivery within a year. They conducted experiments diligently and completed the task in just four months. The Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry has not delayed any of the research and development projects it has undertaken and has completed four projects ahead of schedule.

Scientific researchers' enthusiasm for research has never been so high. The domestication of the Santana car is particularly noteworthy. The car has over 1,500 parts, and each part's domestication requires strict inspection by Volkswagen. For example, an automobile horn, which only needs to ring 60,000 times according to international standards, was required by the German side to ring 100,000 times. The scientific and technological workers of the Shanghai Rubber Products Research Institute and other units persevered through over 300 experiments, and the horn that was finally produced had a ringing rate of 120,000 times, which even the Germans praised.

Enterprises are also "heating up."

Nearly 200 enterprises undertaking research and development projects are raising funds from multiple channels, and scientific research funds have increased compared to previous years. In the past, research institutes actively sought research topics from enterprises, but enterprises with backward technology products were not in short supply, often disappointing enthusiastic scientists. Now, factories and enterprises that want to change their appearance actively bring research topics to the door, eagerly requesting research institutes to jointly tackle key problems and paying close attention to the benefits of research and development projects.

At the Shanghai First Machine Tool Factory, a research and development project entered the critical equipment assembly stage. At this time, the deputy chief engineer Chen Moni broke his leg bone. However, he did not leave his post despite his injury and was carried to the research and development site to direct the resolution of technical difficulties while lying on a stretcher, ensuring that the assembly was completed on time.

At the Shanghai Heavy Machinery Factory, the research and development equipment urgently needed a special steel with a phosphorus content of less than 0.8‰. However, to smelt this steel, it was necessary to frequently remove slag during smelting. Fearless technical staff and workers took turns fighting the high-temperature slag removal battle in front of the smelting furnace. Their iron shovels were red-hot, and their protective clothing was soaked with sweat, but they braved the high temperature and smelted the special steel ahead of schedule...

300 days of research and development practice made Shanghai's scientific and technological circles and enterprises realize that this method of using projects as a "bridge" and economic contracts as a link to connect scientific research with enterprises to overcome major technical difficulties can fully stimulate the enthusiasm of research institutes and enterprises to seek integration. It changes the previous situation where the success rate was low due to unclear responsibilities between enterprises and research institutes during the transfer of achievements. Now, research institutes, in order to strictly abide by the contract, have to invest outstanding talents to ensure timely performance, thus effectively "bonding" science and technology with production, accelerating the transformation of scientific and technological advantages into production advantages.

Displaying Tomorrow

Currently, the research and development has shown a good start. The first batch of projects, originally scheduled to complete 50 sub-projects this year, can now stably complete 70 items. Electronic reflex cameras, multifunctional coated composite fabrics, and other projects have produced some products, and some products have begun to be popular in European and American markets. Three years ago, the first batch of Santanas in Shanghai had a domestication rate of only 2.7%. Now, 494 domestically produced parts have been approved by Volkswagen, with a domestication rate of 30.6%, 5% more than planned. Shanghai-produced Santana cars rank first in quality among the five factories producing Santana series products worldwide.

After the completion of the 14 projects, experts are confident that the research and development will drive Shanghai's industry to undergo major changes, leading to a new Shanghai with a rational industrial structure and a transition from weak to strong in emerging technologies.

The rise of high-tech industries. Among the 14 projects, 4 are high-tech industries: small and microcomputers, program-controlled telephone exchanges, fiber optics communication, and 600,000-kilowatt nuclear power units. In three to five years, these projects can form several high-tech industry groups of considerable scale, driving a batch of traditional industries to sprout new vitality.

Product structure will undergo significant adjustments. The problem of Shanghai's economic contraction in recent years is that there are many general products, few key products, many low-efficiency and high-consumption products, and few high-efficiency and low-consumption products. Research and development will eliminate some low-quality traditional products in Shanghai, replacing them with high-value-added emerging products that will play the role of "leading actors" in some industrial fields. A batch of world-class complete sets of equipment will gradually appear. One of the research and development projects, the completion of Shanghai's first annual production line of 100 million color display tubes, will change the structure of Shanghai's electronic products, pushing medium and low-end television products into the high-end circle to compete for a larger market. It is predicted that after this project is put into production, it can create a tax revenue of 450,000 yuan per day.

The results of the comprehensive benefits "focusing" show that by 1992, the 14 research and development projects will increase Shanghai's output value by 15 billion yuan and increase tax revenue by 5 billion yuan. Due to the export or replacement of a large number of products, by 1992, a huge amount of foreign exchange can also be earned, contributing a rich financial force to the country. Shanghai's prospects are even more inspiring. After the completion of the 14 projects, some projects will become enterprise groups connecting small and medium-sized enterprises. With the reorganization of personnel, funds, and materials, a huge impact will be formed in international competition, driving Shanghai's products to emerge on the world stage.

Shanghai is realizing a turnaround in its predicament. After the "labor pains," what awaits is the joy of rebirth. After completing the first campaign of 14 research and development projects, the second and third campaigns will follow.

On the eastern shore of the Pacific, a new Shanghai will emerge.

    起飞的第一节火箭
    ——上海科技与经济联合的新探索
    新华社记者  陆国元  张学全
    一种高技术程控电话机，因列入上海科研攻关计划，技术难题不断被突破。
    去冬，这种电话机产量比计划猛超一万门。行家据此推算，原定1990年完成30万门电话机的规划，可望提前1年达标。
    程控电话是上海14个重大攻关项目之一。它和其它项目一起，作为科研渗入生产的新的生长点，为上海经济腾飞描绘了崭新的画卷。
        桂冠旁落后的抉择
    作为我国最大工业基地的上海，过去独占国民生产总值、工业产值、出口贸易全国第一的桂冠。然而改革之后上海人发现，上海不再是雄风犹在的“老大哥”，几项桂冠纷纷旁落，上海经济发展陷入了窘境：一方面科研有优势，一方面生产上不去。
    上海潜藏雄厚的科研实力，拥有科技人员40多万人，总体实力远远强于亚洲“四小龙”。近年来上海虽然在科技促生产方面做了不少文章，诸如开放技术市场、厂所挂钩转让成果、科研人员下乡领办乡镇企业等，也起了一定作用。但科技与生产之间的鸿沟仍未填平，尤其阻碍着科技成果向大中企业转化，致使一些骨干工业“未老先衰”。
    科研与生产缺乏良性运行机制，是导致这种弊端的主要原因。有关资料显示：上海的科研与企业严重脱节。目前上海一半以上的科研所、80％的科研人员、一半左右的科研经费，都游离于企业之外，以致大批成果搁置实验室，骨干企业中的一些技术难题得不到及时解决，企业进行技术开发的经费得不到保证，经济增长由此滑入迟缓之途。
    于是，上海市领导开始寻找一种新的科研运转机制。
    去年6月，一个有关发挥科技优势的报告，送到市委书记江泽民和市长朱熔基手中。集纳数百专家意见的报告提出一种新思路：以重大项目为桥梁，运用经济与法律结合的手段，将科研力量与企业连接起来，共同攻克大中企业的技术难点。力争两三年内实现技术上的大突破，带动产品结构调整，驱动经济起飞。
    为提高科研攻关效率，专家们还建议，对攻关项目实行统一领导；厂所联合攻关，以厂为主，科研部门负责突破技术，工厂提供攻关经费，并使技术产业化；攻关过程引入竞争机制，项目公开招标，中标项目一律签订经济合同，并由法律部门公证。
    这种科研结合生产的新方案，立即得到市政府批准。经过对几十个工业部门上千家大中企业论证，14个重大攻关项目很快被筛选出来，并被列入上海科研攻关第一战役。
      不可遏制的“磁场效应”
    揭开项目表，映入眼帘的是：桑塔纳轿车国产化、微型计算机、超临界火电机组、光纤通信、30万吨乙烯和合成氨装置国产化、多功能涂层复合织物、60万千瓦核电设备研制……
    以市长朱熔基为组长的攻关小组成立后，科研所、大学、相关企业联合参战的攻关会战，由此拉开了帷幕。
    1988年9月27日，从14个项中分解出的136个课题，首次向全市公开招标。上海市500个研究所、大学和企业的科研人员，从四面八方涌来投标，一天投出标书900多份。在最后中标的98个课题中，有2000多名科技人员参与攻关，其中400名是研究员、教授和高级工程师。今年5月27日，上海再次对72个课题公开招标，投标者仍然络绎不绝。
    重大项目的攻关，像磁石一样吸引着科学家。中国科学院上海有机化学研究所副所长林国强说：过去号召我们进入“主战场”，一无渠道，二来“主人”似乎也并不迫切需要。现在，重点项目攻关，为我们提供了可以充分施展科技才干的竞技赛场，都想去一较高下。这个所两次投标，争取到15个课题。现有70名科研人员的科研工作量，比往年增加1／3或1／4。
    中标项目因实行合同责任制，攻关者为避免“吃官司”，无不夜以继日拚命工作，力争早日兑现。有个3人课题组为一家工厂研制一种特殊感光材料，合同规定一年交货，他们潜心试验，只用4个月就啃下这块“硬骨头”。上海有机化学研究所承接的攻关课题现无一脱期，并有4个项目提前完成任务。
    科研人员的科研热情从来没有这样高涨过。桑塔纳轿车国产化的攻关，颇为引人注目。轿车有1500多个零部件，每个部件的国产化都需经过联邦德国大众汽车公司严格检查。如一个汽车喇叭，国际通用标准只需响6万次，而合作的联邦德国方面坚持要研究人员为其配套的喇叭响10万次。上海橡胶制品研究所等单位的科技工作者，锲而不舍地试验300余次，最终问世的喇叭鸣响率提高到了12万次，联邦德国人也称赞不已。
      企业也“热”了起来。
    有近200家承担攻关项目的企业，都在多渠道筹集攻关费，科研经费投入均比往年增加。过去，科研所主动去企业征求研究课题，技术落后产品却不愁卖不出去的企业往往使热情的科学家扫兴而归。如今，那些力图想改变面貌的工厂企业主动送课题上门，热情请求科研所携手攻关，并对攻关项目效益十分关注。
    在上海第一机床厂，一个攻关项目进入设备组装关键阶段。正在这时，厂副总工程师陈莫尼摔断了腿骨。可他却重伤不离岗位，要人抬他到攻关现场，躺在担架上指挥解决技术难题，确保组装按时结束。
    在上海重型机器厂，核电攻关设备急需一种含磷量低于0.8‰的特殊钢。可是，要炼这种钢必须在冶炼时勤扒炉渣。无畏的厂技术员和工人，轮流在炼钢炉前展开高温扒渣战斗。手中的铁扒烧红了、身上的防护衣湿透了，他们硬是冒着高温，将特殊钢提前炼了出来。……
    300天的攻关实践，使上海科技界和企业界发现，这种以项目为“桥”，以经济合同为纽带，连接科研和企业攻克重大技术难题的方式，能充分激发科研单位和企业寻求结合的积极性。改变过去成果转让时因企业和研究所双方责任不够明确造成成功率低的状况。如今，研究所为严守合同，不得不投入优秀人才以确保按时履约，因而有效地“粘合”了科技与生产这两张皮，加快了科研优势向生产优势的转化。
        展示着明天
    时下，攻关展示了良好开端。首批课题原订今年完成50个子项目，而按目前进度可稳拿70项。电子反光照相机、多功能涂层复合织物等一些项目，已获部分产品，有些产品开始走俏欧美市场。3年前，首批桑塔纳在沪问世，国产化率仅2.7％。而现在已有494项国产零部件获大众汽车公司认可，国产化率达到30.6％，比计划多了5％。上海生产的桑塔纳轿车，在世界生产桑塔纳系列产品的5个厂家中，质量名列第一。
    14个项目攻关结束后，专家们满有把握地指出：攻关将推动上海工业发生重大转机，引出一个产业结构趋向合理、新兴技术由弱变强的新上海。
    高技术产业群雄崛起。在14个项目中，属于高技术产业的有4项：小型、微型计算机，程控电话交换机，光纤通信和60万千瓦核电机组，三五年后，这些项目可形成几个相当规模的高技术产业群体，带动一批传统产业萌发生机。
    产品结构将获大的调整。大路产品多、拳头产品少、低效高耗产品多、高效低耗产品少，是上海近年经济萎缩的难题。攻关将使上海一些劣质传统产品被淘汰，取而代之的高附加值新兴产品，将在一些工业领域充当“主角”。具有世界先进水平的一批成套设备将陆续面世。攻关项目之一，上海第一条年产100万只彩色显相管生产线的建成，将使上海的电子产品结构发生质变，把中低档电视产品推入高档圈，以争得占领大市场的优势。据预测，这个项目投产以后，每天可创收税利45万元。
    综合效益“聚焦”的结果显示：到1992年，14个攻关项目将使上海新增产值150亿元，新增税利50亿元。由于大批产品可出口或替代进口，到1992年还可创收一笔巨额外汇，为国家贡献丰厚财力。上海的远景更加鼓舞人心。14个项目攻关完成以后，若干项目将成为联结中小厂家的企业集团。随着人、财、物的重新组合，在国际竞争中将形成巨大撞击力，带动上海货在世界舞台崭露头角。
    上海正在困境中实现转折，“阵痛”过后，迎来的必将是新生的喜悦。在完成第一战役的14个攻关项目后，接着还要打第二、第三个战役。
    在太平洋东岸，一个新上海将令人刮目相看。
