The National Bureau of Statistics, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China today released eight key economic indicators for the first half of the year. These indicators show that fixed asset investment has been initially controlled, the increase in credit has been less than last year, wage growth for workers has stabilized, and energy-saving efforts have made some progress. However, there are still many issues, particularly the situation where industrial economic benefits remain low and show no signs of improvement.

According to the report, the main features of fixed asset investment by state-owned enterprises in the first half of the year are as follows: first, the scale has been reduced; second, the scope of reduction has expanded; third, there has been a steady decline; fourth, the proportion of investment in provinces (municipalities) with high investment has decreased. There have been three changes in credit: first, the increase in credit has been less than last year; second, there is an imbalance in growth between regions; third, the balance of investment loans has increased. Now that the season for monetary issuance has arrived, the increase in the national retail price index is again greater than last year, and the task of tightening the credit scale remains quite arduous.

Industrial labor productivity has grown slowly, and the sales tax rate and fund tax rate have declined. From January to June, the industrial labor productivity of state-owned independent accounting enterprises was 9369 billion yuan, an increase of 3.1% over the same period last year. Nationwide, 13 regions were below the national average. The sales tax rate for state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises in the first half of the year was 17.5%, a decrease of 2.3% compared to the same period last year. The fund tax rate also decreased by 2.1% compared to the same period last year. The increase in product costs remains high. From January to June, the comparable product costs for state-owned budgetary industrial enterprises increased by 18.6%, an increase of 11.8% compared to the same period last year, with all 29 surveyed regions exceeding the budget.

In the first half of this year, energy-saving efforts have made progress. The energy consumption per 10,000 yuan of industrial output value for state-owned budgetary enterprises was 4.71 tons of standard coal, a decrease of 4.3% compared to the same period last year.

    上半年八项重要经济指标显示
    固定资产投资已初步控制
    工业经济效益不高未见好转
    新华社北京7月30日电　国家统计局、国家计委、财政部和中国人民银行今天公布的八项重要经济指标显示，今年上半年固定资产投资已初步控制，信贷增加额小于去年，职工工资增长趋向平稳，节能工作有所进展。但面临问题仍然不少，尤其是工业经济效益不高的状况不见好转。
    据介绍，上半年全民所有制单位固定资产投资出现特点：一是规模减小，二是压缩面扩大，三是稳步回落，四是投资大的省（市）投资额所占比重下降。信贷出现三个变化：一是信贷增加额小于去年，二是地区间增长不平衡，三是投资贷款余额增多。现在已进入货币投放季节，全国零售物价指数上升幅度又比上年大，紧缩信贷规模的任务依然相当艰巨。
    工业劳动生产率缓慢增长，销售利税率和资金利税率下降。1至6月，全民所有制独立核算企业工业劳动生产率9369亿元，比上年同期增长3.1％。全国有13个地区低于全国平均水平。上半年全民所有制预算内工业销售利税率为17.5％，比上年同期下降2.3％。资金利税率则比上年同期下降2.1％。产品成本上升幅度居高不下。1至6月，全民所有制预算内工业可比产品成本上升18.6％，比上年同期提高11.8％，被统计的29个地区全部超支。
    今年上半年节能工作取得进展，全民所有制预算内企业万元工业总产值能耗4.71吨标准煤，比上年同期下降了4.3％。
