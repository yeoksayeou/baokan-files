Qinhuangdao is transforming from a tourist destination into a hotspot for foreign investment. By the end of June this year, foreign investors had already invested $539 million, establishing 44 joint ventures with Chinese companies. Among these, 37 are production-oriented enterprises, accounting for 84.1% of the total number of foreign-invested enterprises. The momentum of foreign investment at the Beidaihe Summer Commodity Fair held in early July remained strong, with foreign investors proposing and signing investment projects, several of which have investments exceeding $100 million.

At the fair, a Taiwanese businessman signed a contract to produce and export high-end leather shoes. Mr. Sakaguchi, a Japanese businessman, decided to invest $21.38 million to establish the Qinhuangdao Sakaguchi Wire Products Co., Ltd. on his first visit. On May 15 this year, during Mr. Sakaguchi's second visit to Qinhuangdao, he completed the formalities and received the business license.

    在交易会上，一位台湾客商签订了生产出口高档皮鞋的合同。日本商人阪口先生第一次来这里就决定投资2138万美元兴办秦皇岛市阪口线材工业有限公司。今年5月15日，阪口先生第二次来秦皇岛，即办理并领取了营业执照。
