The largest flood peak of the Yangtze River this year safely passed through Wuhan at 4 a.m. today. At the time the flood peak passed through Wuhan, the water level at Wuhan's Yangtze River Gauge Station reached 26.65 meters, exceeding the warning level by 0.35 meters. The flow rate was 61,200 cubic meters per second.

The flood peak lasted for 5 hours in Wuhan's river channel. After the flood peak passed, the water level at Wuhan's Yangtze River Gauge Station quickly dropped to 26.61 meters by 9 a.m. today. During the period when the flood peak arrived, Wuhan's three towns maintained normal operations for water (ships), land (cars), and air (airplanes) transportation.

To prevent greater risks as the floodwater recedes and to prepare for a possible larger flood peak, the anti-flood forces along the river in Wuhan's three towns continue to guard the river embankments.

    长江洪峰安全过武汉
    新华社武汉7月18日电  （通讯员张起、记者詹仲德）记者从武汉市防汛指挥部获悉，长江今年入汛以来最大洪峰于今日凌晨4时安全通过武汉。洪峰通过武汉时，武汉关水位高达26.65米，超过警戒水位0.35米。流量达61200立方米每秒。
    洪峰在武汉河道持续5个小时，洪峰过后，武汉关水位迅速下降，到今天上午9时，已下降到26.61米。洪峰到来期间，武汉三镇“水（轮船）、陆（汽车）、空（飞机）”三路交通照常营运。
    为防止洪水退却而出现更大险情，并迎战有可能出现的更大洪峰，武汉三镇各沿江的防汛大军，仍在江堤上把守。
