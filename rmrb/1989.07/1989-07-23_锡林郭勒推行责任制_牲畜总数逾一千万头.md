Xilingol, the largest pastoral area in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, has achieved a bumper harvest in livestock farming this year. According to statistics up to the end of June for the pastoral year, the total number of livestock reached 10.69 million head (units). Xilingol is the first among all pastoral leagues and prefectures in the country to achieve a livestock population exceeding 10 million.

Xilingol League, which covers an area of 200,000 square kilometers and has long been the focus of attention from global grassland ecology experts, is a key livestock farming base in the country. Since the 1960s, the league has twice proposed the goal of achieving 10 million head of livestock, but these attempts were unsuccessful. In 1987, the league committee and the league government carefully analyzed the actual situation of the entire league and, after expert verification, set the goal of achieving 10 million head of livestock by 1990. After two years of effort, the long-held aspiration of several generations of herders on the grasslands was finally realized ahead of schedule.

The significant step forward in Xilingol's livestock farming is a result of implementing the Party's policy of enriching the people and opening up to the outside world. In recent years, the pastoral areas have implemented the dual-contract responsibility system for livestock and grasslands, greatly motivating the production enthusiasm of the broad masses of herders. Under the leadership and support of the league committee and the league government, herders have embarked on a new path of building and scientifically managing livestock farming. Currently, the entire league has established a mechanism for investing in livestock farming infrastructure, with a total investment of over 110 million yuan in recent years, of which 82.9% was invested by collectives and herders. The league has achieved over 88% of livestock housing, effectively improving disaster resistance and production levels.

    锡林郭勒推行责任制
    牲畜总数逾一千万头
    本报讯　内蒙古自治区最大的牧区锡林郭勒盟今年畜牧业生产获得特大丰收，据到6月底牧业年度统计，牲畜总数达到1069万头（只），在全国牧业盟、州中第一个实现牲畜总数突破1000万。
    拥有20万平方公里土地、一直受到世界草原生态专家注目的锡林郭勒盟，是全国重点畜牧业基地。从60年代以来，盟里曾两次提出实现牲畜1000万的口号，但是都未能如愿。1987年，盟委、盟公署认真分析了全盟的实际情况，并经过专家论证，提出到1990年实现牲畜1000万的奋斗目标。经过两年努力，草原上几代人的宿愿终于提前实现了。
    锡盟畜牧业生产迈出历史性的一步，是贯彻党的富民政策和改革开放的结果。近几年来，牧区推行畜草双承包等责任制，极大地调动了广大牧民的生产积极性。在盟委、盟公署的领导和支持下，牧民开始走上一条建设养畜、科学养畜的新路子。现在全盟已建立起牧业基础建设投入机制，几年来总投入达1.1亿多元，其中82.9％是集体和牧户投入的。全盟棚圈化达88％以上，有效地提高了抗灾能力和生产力水平。（梁荣　其其格　赵志伟）
