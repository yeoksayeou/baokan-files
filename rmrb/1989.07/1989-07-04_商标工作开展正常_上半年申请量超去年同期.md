Trademark Work Proceeds Normally
Trademark Applications Surpass Last Year's Figures for the Same Period

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Li Jizhong, Director of the Trademark Office of the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, said today that China's trademark work has proceeded normally this year. Even during the months of turmoil and counter-revolutionary rioting in Beijing, the acceptance, examination, and registration of trademark applications from both domestic and foreign entities have continued without interruption.

Statistics show that a total of 21,500 trademark registration applications were received in the first half of this year, an increase of 153 applications over the same period last year. Of these, 19,200 were domestic trademark registration applications, and 2,369 were foreign trademark registration applications. Applications were received from 39 countries and regions. Additionally, 680 trademark registration applications were received from Taiwan.

It is reported that in the 10 years since China's reform and opening up, the number of valid registered trademarks has increased 7.2 times compared to the previous 30 years. By the end of June this year, the number of valid registered trademarks had reached 232,100. Of these, 197,800 were domestic trademarks, and 34,300 were foreign trademarks. The countries and regions with the most registered trademarks in China include the United States, Japan, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, France, and Hong Kong.
