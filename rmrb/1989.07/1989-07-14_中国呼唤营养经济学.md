Food, energy, water, and environmental issues are known as the four major crises of the contemporary world. In our country, these issues are more urgent than in many other countries. Among these, the issue of food nutrition is particularly prominent.

The Nation's Nutritional Status is Not Ideal

Currently, the nutritional status of the Chinese people, compared to developed countries, does not have as large a gap as the per capita national income level. If guided properly, there is still the possibility of narrowing the gap with developed countries and utilizing certain inherent advantages to reduce the problems caused by nutritional imbalances in developed countries. However, due to certain drawbacks in our dietary traditions, incorrect consumer attitudes, blind pursuit of food consumption, unreasonable consumption guidance, and the loss and waste of nutritional sources, not only has the national nutritional status not been ideal, but the supply-demand relationship of food has always been in an overly tense state. This is reflected in the fact that the Engel coefficient, which represents the proportion of food consumption in total consumption, remains high.

Implementing a national nutrition development plan is a complex systematic project. Apart from being directly controlled by agricultural development conditions, it is also constrained by factors such as national consumption levels, dietary habits, consumption psychology, food industry levels, cultural levels, and nutritional guidance policies. To make food meet the nutritional needs of people, starting from the cultivation and breeding to obtain primary products, it must go through a series of processing and circulation links before it can be delivered to consumers, ultimately providing consumers with free choice. Consumers decide how to choose food to meet their own needs mainly based on the use value and exchange value of the food itself. The use value of food is its edible value, mainly reflected in nutrition, hygiene, and palatability, in addition to the degree of satiety and convenience of eating.

The exchange value of food is reflected in the price, mainly determined by the labor input and embodied labor, as well as the necessary added value and the influence of supply and demand in the circulation process. People, based on the different degrees of demand for various foods, will decide their consumption orientation by weighing the gains and losses of the use value and exchange value of food. It can be seen that the nutritional benefits of people's food consumption are always closely related to economic value. However, the edible value and exchange value of food are often not consistent. Foods with high exchange value do not necessarily have high edible value; foods with low exchange value sometimes have high edible value, and these are important issues that people often overlook. The agricultural production and food processing departments are more concerned with obtaining higher yields and output values with lower inputs; consumers are more concerned with obtaining delicious meals at lower costs; while nutrition workers often overlook the pursuit of the former and make relatively simple evaluations from the nutritional aspect.

Different value orientations in agriculture, the food industry, and diet often make it difficult to have a common language in solving the ultimate goal of one's own nutritional problems. Therefore, it is necessary to study the relationship between nutrition and economics, so that they can become an integrated whole in studying and solving people's nutritional security problems, have a unified goal, a common language, and feasible plans. And use this to guide people to produce, process, and consume rationally, thereby more effectively improving people's nutritional status.

The Theoretical Basis of the "Vegetable Basket Project"

"Nutritional Economics" is an interdisciplinary field of nutrition and economics, studying economic issues in nutrition, or using economic theories and methods to study practical problems in nutrition. It is an applied science with high practical value. The basic goal of this discipline is to achieve higher nutritional benefits with lower inputs. Its research scope can be macro, meso, or micro. Macro-level research examines the entire process from the cultivation, planting, and breeding of agricultural and livestock products to the food processing and manufacturing process, then entering the commercial service circulation field, and finally reaching the individual consumer. It studies the overall economic input of resources, varieties, energy consumption, labor services, storage, transportation, procurement, allocation, etc., and the final nutritional benefits, selects the best plan, pursues overall coordination, and maximizes the satisfaction of national nutritional needs. Researching a specific part or link separately, examining the relationship between economic input and direct nutritional benefits, is within the meso or micro scope.

From the agricultural production perspective, studying nutritional economic issues aims to improve the nutritional substance yield of agricultural inputs, researching how planting and breeding industries can obtain rich nutritional agricultural and livestock products with relatively low inputs.

From the food processing perspective, studying nutritional economic issues requires functional analysis of processed products. It is necessary to achieve necessary nutritional functions with lower inputs of raw materials, energy, and labor. Insufficient or excessive nutritional functions of food are not high-efficiency processed products. Pursuing excessive processing of food causes a large loss of natural nutritional substances, and then artificially adding various other components, not only increases unnecessary inputs but also does not necessarily show higher nutritional functions and may even be harmful to health, sometimes resulting in a loss rather than a gain. Therefore, seeking the most economical resource comprehensive utilization plan, processing formula, and process around nutritional benefits should be the primary goal that the food processing sector must pursue, rather than pursuing the increase of output value and profits.

The food circulation sector, catering services, and individual (or family) consumption are the final stages of implementing rational nutrition, directly reflecting the nutritional issues of each individual. From this perspective, studying nutritional economics is to enable consumers to obtain rich and balanced diets at a lower economic cost, including storage, transportation, preservation, selection, and cooking processing utilization issues. For consumers, the choice of food is free, but it must be scientifically and economically principled, which is a civilized choice and also a choice that suits the national conditions. This not only requires nutritional hygiene guidance but also policy and strategic guidance.

All agricultural products and food production, processing, and utilization are energy and nutritional substance transformations under specific conditions. The primary task of nutritional economics is to obtain rich heat energy and nutritional substances with the most economical energy and nutritional substances (including fertilizers, feed, additives, etc.).

Traditional agriculture mainly relies on natural conditions and the labor of humans and animals to obtain a certain amount of nutritional substances. Although the yield is not high, the energy input is very low. Usually, to obtain 1 calorie of food, less than 1 calorie of energy is needed. However, the development of modern agriculture and the food industry, as well as modern storage, transportation conditions, and cooking methods, although can significantly improve production efficiency and increase the variety of processed foods, require the input of industrial energy many times higher than traditional agriculture and processing industries. In developed countries, for every 1 calorie of food consumed, more than 6 calories of energy are needed. Currently, the energy input for every 1 calorie of food consumed by the Chinese people is still less than 2 calories, but the total energy consumed in the agricultural and food systems has reached more than 1/4 of the national total energy consumption, while in developed countries, it generally does not exceed 1/5 of the total energy consumption. Due to the high level of economic development in developed countries, the food system, while pursuing high efficiency, also consumes a large amount of food resources and industrial energy, sometimes even wasting them, and has not achieved an ideal nutritional benefit. In our country, the resources of the agricultural production system are limited, energy is seriously insufficient, and cooking energy in rural areas is extremely scarce, which is well known and difficult to fundamentally alleviate in a considerable period. Therefore, in our country's agricultural and food systems, adopting the approach of high energy and high input to obtain high yield and high output value is not a choice that suits the national conditions.

Implementing China's nutritional development issues involves many disciplines and complex work departments. No single discipline or department can independently solve the problem. To enable our limited resources to improve people's nutritional status more quickly and better, it is necessary for various disciplines and departments to work together, focusing on a common goal—to achieve higher nutritional benefits with lower inputs—to think about problems and plan work. Taking the hand-in-hand cooperation of nutrition and economics as an opportunity, and their theories and methods as guidance, is an important way to promote the rational nutrition of the Chinese people. "Nutritional Economics" should become an important theoretical basis for China to achieve the "Vegetable Basket Project." China calls for "Nutritional Economics," looking forward to its establishment and development, which is an important topic with significant theoretical and practical implications for the national economy and people's livelihood.

    中国呼唤营养经济学
    王益兴
    食物、能源、水源和环境问题，被称之为当今世界的四大危机。在我国，这些问题的紧迫感更甚于世界上其它许多国家。其中的食物营养问题在一定意义上更为突出。
    国民营养状况不尽如人意
    目前我国人民的营养状况与发达国家相比，没有出现像人均国民收入水平那样大的差距，如果引导得当，还有进一步缩小与发达国家差距的可能性，并有可能利用某些固有的优势，以减少发达国家中人们由于营养失调而出现的困扰。但是，由于我国饮食传统的某些弊端，不正确的消费心态，盲目的食物消费追求，不尽合理的消费导向，以及营养源的损失浪费，不仅造成国民营养状况还不如人意，而且使食物供求关系一直处于过分的紧张状态，显示食物消费占全部消费比重的恩格尔系数始终持高不下。
    实施国民营养发展规划是一项复杂的系统工程，除直接受农业发展条件控制外，还受到国民消费水平、饮食习惯、消费心理，以及食品工业水平、文化水平、营养指导方针等因素的制约。食物要达到满足人们营养的目的，从种植、养殖获得初级产品开始，还必须经过一系列的加工和流通环节才能送到消费者面前，最终提供消费者自由选择。消费者如何选择食物来满足自身的需求，主要是依据食物本身所具有的使用价值及其交换价值来决定。食物的使用价值就是食用价值，主要表现在营养、卫生与适口等三个方面，此外还有食用的饱腹程度与方便程度等。
    食物的交换价值表现为价格，主要取决于投入的劳动量和物化劳动量，以及商品在流通过程中必要的附加值和供求关系的影响。人们在对各类食物不同需求程度的基础上，将依据食物的使用价值和交换价值的得失衡量来决定消费取向。可见，人们消费食物的营养效益，时刻都与经济价值紧密相关。然而，食物的食用价值与交换价值之间往往不是一致的。交换价值高的食物，其食用价值不一定都很高；交换价值不高的食物，其食用价值有时却是很高的，这些常是人们容易忽视的重要问题。农业生产和食品加工部门比较关心的，是以较低的投入取得较高的产量与产值；消费者比较关心的，是以较低的代价取得美味的膳食；而营养工作者则往往比较忽视前者的追求，较单纯地从营养方面作出评估。
    人们在农业、食品业和饮食方面的不同价值观，造成在解决自身的营养问题这个最终目标上，往往难以有共同的语言。因此，需要研究营养学与经济学之间的关系，使它们在研究解决人们的营养保障问题上成为一个整体，有一致的目标，有共同的语言，有可行的方案。并以此指导人们合理的生产、加工和消费，从而更有效地改善人们的营养状况。
    “菜篮子工程”的理论基础
    “营养经济学”是营养学与经济学的交叉学科，是研究营养学中的经济问题，或者说是用经济学的理论与方法来研究营养学的实践问题。它是一门应用科学，具有很高的实用价值。这门学科研究的基本目标，是如何以较低的投入取得较高的营养效益。它的研究范围可以是宏观的，也可以是中观的或微观的。宏观上的考察，是从农、畜产品的培育、种植、饲养阶段，到食品加工制作过程，然后进入商业服务的流通领域，最终到达消费个体这一全部过程中，研究其资源、品种、能耗、劳务、储运、采购、调配等方面的总体经济投入与最终营养效益的关系，选择最佳方案，追求整体协调，从而最大限度地满足国民的营养需求。分别地研究某个局部或环节，考察其经济投入与直接营养效益的关系问题，则是中观或微观的范围。
    从农产角度研究营养经济问题，是以考察如何提高农业投入的营养物质收获为主要目标，研究种植和饲养业如何以比较低的投入获取丰富的营养物质的农畜产品。
    从食品加工角度去研究营养经济问题，就要对加工产品进行功能分析。应以较低的原料、能量和劳动量的投入，取得必要的营养功能。食品的营养功能不足或营养功能过剩，都不是高效益的加工产品。一味地追求食品的精加工，造成天然营养物质的大量损失，再人为地添加其它多种成分，不仅会增加不必要的投入，而且也未必能显示更高的营养功能，甚至会有害人体健康，有时是得不偿失的。因此，围绕营养效益去寻求最经济的资源综合利用方案、加工配方和工艺过程，应该是食品加工部门必须首先追求的目标，而不应片面地追求产值和利润的提高。
    食品流通领域、饮食服务部门和个体（或家庭）消费是实施合理营养的最后阶段，是最终体现到每个人的切身营养问题。从这个角度去研究营养经济，就是要使消费者以较低的经济代价换取丰富而平衡的膳食，其中包括储运、保鲜、选配和烹调加工利用问题。对于消费者来说，吃的选择是自由的，但必须是符合科学而经济的原则，这才是文明的选择，也是适应国情的选择。这不仅需要有营养卫生学的指导，还必须有方针和政策上的指引。
    所有农产品和食品的生产加工与利用，都是在特定条件下的能量、营养物质的转换。营养经济学的首要任务，就是要以最经济的能量、营养物质（包括肥料、饲料、添加剂等）的投入，以换取丰富的热能与营养物质的产品。
    传统的农业，主要依靠自然条件的合成，并投入人、畜力的劳动，就可以获取一定量的营养物质。虽然产量不高，但能源的投入是很低的。通常获取1卡热能的食物，只需投入不足1卡的能量就可以实现。然而现代农业和食品工业、以及现代储运条件和烹调手段的发展，虽然能使生产效率显著提高，加工食品的种类增多，但需要投入比传统农业与加工业高出许多倍的工业能源才能实现。在发达国家里，人们每消费1卡的食物，需要6卡以上的能量投入。我国目前人们每消费1卡食物的能量投入虽然尚不足2卡，但在农业与食品系统内消费的总能量已达全国能量总消费的1／4以上，而在发达国家里一般都不超过能量总消费的1／5。由于发达国家的经济发展水平很高，膳食系统在追求高效益的同时，也耗费了较多的食物资源与工业能源，有时甚至是浪费的，而在营养效益上并未达到理想的境地。在我国，农业生产系统的资源有限、能源严重不足，广大农村炊事能源异常短缺，这是人所共知的，在相当长的时期内难以根本缓解。因此，在我国农业和食品系统里要想采取以高能量、高投入来换取高产量和高产值的途径，不是适应国情的选择。
    实施我国的营养发展问题，是涉及学科门类较多、工作部门庞杂的大问题，任何一个学科、一个部门都无力独自求得解决。为使我国有限的资源能更快更好地改善人们的营养状况，需要各学科间、部门间的通力合作，围绕一个共同的目标——以较低投入取得较高营养效益去思考问题、规划工作。以营养学和经济学的携手为契机，以它们的理论与方法为指引，是推进我国人民合理营养的重要途径。“营养经济学”应成为我国实现“菜篮子工程”的重要理论基础。中国呼唤“营养经济学”，期待它的建立与发展，这是对国计民生有着重要理论与实践意义的重要课题。
