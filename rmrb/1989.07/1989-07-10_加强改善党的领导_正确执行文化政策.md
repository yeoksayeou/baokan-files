Strengthening and improving the Party committee's leadership of cultural work and ensuring the implementation of the Party's policies on culture are crucial issues in the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

The Party's leadership in cultural work fundamentally lies in adhering to the basic line of "one center, two basic points" established by the 13th Party Congress, ensuring the correct direction of cultural work, and developing and flourishing socialist cultural undertakings. In other words, leadership must be strengthened from the perspective of political principles and political direction. This is the main responsibility of the Party committee in leading cultural work after the separation of Party and government functions. The practice of building socialist modernization since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee has shown us that only by consistently and unwaveringly adhering to the four cardinal principles and reform and opening up, and by integrating these two basic points into practical work and reflecting them in all aspects of reform and construction, can we hope to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country. Socialist cultural undertakings are an important part of our goals for the new era and an important means to ensure the realization of these goals. Therefore, resolutely implementing the Party's basic line is an essential requirement for socialist cultural work. After the separation of Party and government functions, the Party committee should neither replace the government in managing cultural functions nor take over the activities of mass art groups, becoming bogged down in specific matters and affecting political leadership. Nor should it abandon leadership. The Party committee should focus on political principles and political direction, ensuring that cultural work develops in the correct direction at the macro level.

How should the Party committee strengthen its political leadership in cultural work? Based on the practice of recent years, several key relationships need to be carefully handled.

1. The relationship between the "two serves" direction and the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy

Serving the people and serving socialism embodies the essential nature of socialist culture and is the overall direction of cultural construction. Ignoring the fundamental direction of culture's "two serves" can lead to the loss of socialist culture's intrinsic value and the degradation of spiritual products. Socialist culture serves the masses, which means it must meet the diverse spiritual needs of people at all levels. This requires cultural workers to create spiritual products of various themes and styles with their unique personalities, enriching our cultural market with beautiful spiritual nourishment, refining people's sentiments, and inspiring them to build a new life. In other words, only by implementing the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend can socialist cultural undertakings truly flourish and meet the growing spiritual and cultural needs of the people. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend is an inherent law of cultural and artistic development. If only one flower blooms, the cultural and artistic vitality will be stifled. Therefore, adhering to the "two serves" direction and implementing the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy are both essential. Without the "two serves," the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy loses its direction. Without the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy, the "two serves" direction becomes an empty slogan.

There has been a long-standing debate on the issue of advocating the "main melody" in literary and artistic creation. Does advocating the main melody conflict with implementing the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy? I believe it does not. The "main melody" we advocate is the great practice of the 11 billion people of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, following the basic line of the primary stage of socialism, working together in unity, striving hard, and actively building socialism with Chinese characteristics. This "main melody" is an objective reality of contemporary Chinese society, not something fabricated by anyone. Literature and art must reflect the times and objective life, so they cannot ignore the existence of this main melody. The "main melody" is not monotonous; it contains rich content. Literary and artistic workers, of course, have the freedom to express their inner world, but they cannot lack a sense of social responsibility and historical mission. Literary and artistic workers should delve into the vibrant and complex reality, understand, familiarize themselves with, and experience the inner world of various characters, and through their creative artistic practice, express the voice of the people and let their pulse beat with the pulse of the times. China's reform and opening up are in a period of great change between old and new systems. Social life and national psychology are undergoing rapid, complex, rich, and colorful changes, which is a historical opportunity unprecedented for literary and artistic workers. If literary and artistic workers can grasp and deeply reveal this change, they will definitely be able to create outstanding works that inspire deep thought and inspire progress, and it is possible to produce great works that will be remembered for generations. If they distance themselves from life, dilute life, and miss this rare historical opportunity, they will regret it. Advocating that literary and artistic creation reflects the main melody of the times does not exclude works of other themes. All healthy and beneficial works, and even some harmless ones, can be included in the grand symphony of socialist culture. Advocating the main melody is not to impose administrative interference, nor is it to abandon the "hundred flowers and hundred schools of thought" policy. Instead, it is to hope that literary and artistic workers seize the historical opportunity and write works of various styles that are worthy of the times, which is consistent with the goals that literary and artistic workers strive for.

2. The relationship between national culture and foreign culture

Culture is a common wealth of all humanity. Any culture with national characteristics can be said to be a contribution to human society, and we must respect and learn from it. We must cherish the historical opportunity given by the times, adhere to the open policy, and seriously learn from all beneficial aspects of foreign culture to enrich our national culture. However, there is a trend worth noting: some people adopt an attitude of disdain, denigration, and outright rejection of traditional Chinese culture, which not only greatly hurts the national pride of our compatriots but also risks leading the construction of new socialist culture astray. The foundation and mainstream of culture should be the rich national characteristics of the country, and the introduction of foreign culture is only to enrich, perfect, and strengthen itself. In dealing with the relationship between national culture and foreign culture, we must not fall into any blindness. We must use the Marxist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to dare to and be good at criticizing, negating, and rejecting the dross in traditional culture, and to dare to and be good at criticizing, negating, and rejecting the backward and decadent aspects of foreign culture, while absorbing its progressive and beneficial aspects. Thus, on the basis of critically inheriting traditional culture and critically absorbing foreign culture, we can promote the development and prosperity of new socialist culture of the Chinese nation.

3. The relationship between social benefits and economic benefits

The basic function of spiritual products is to influence people's spirits, which is different from material products. Therefore, we must pay great attention to their social benefits. We cannot require cultural workers to produce spiritual products solely for economic benefits, nor can we generally judge the quality of cultural departments' work by the level of economic benefits. If we simply apply the laws of commodity economy and commodity exchange to the production of cultural and artistic works, under the pressure and temptation of money, socialist cultural and artistic undertakings will inevitably take the wrong path, leading to the loss and degradation of the intrinsic value of artistic products, and many things that are harmful or even harmful to society will quickly proliferate. This is not an alarmist statement but a shocking reality. Of course, there is indeed an issue of economic benefits in cultural work. Cultural departments, due to economic difficulties, seriously affect the production of spiritual products, and thus have to pay some attention to economic benefits. Therefore, while advocating the importance of social benefits in cultural work, we should pay attention to the investment in cultural construction and scientifically study the issues of cultural management to improve the economic benefits of cultural work. However, when economic benefits conflict with social benefits, social benefits should be placed first without hesitation. At no time and under no circumstances should economic benefits be pursued at the expense of social benefits.

4. The relationship between reform and management

The reform of cultural work, including institutional reform, system reform, and business reform, is an urgent task for the development of cultural undertakings. For example, the reform of art performance troupes can be said to have reached a point where they cannot survive without reform. The fundamental purpose of cultural reform is to fully liberate the productive forces in the cultural field and flourish socialist cultural undertakings. In recent years, the momentum for cultural reform has not been small, but the steps of reform have been very difficult. At the same time, cultural management is in a state of considerable chaos. Therefore, adhering to reform and strengthening management have become urgent tasks that cannot be neglected. The old system has serious drawbacks, and the new system has many advantages, which is undeniable. However, the transition from old to new systems takes time. If we only wait for the system reform to be completed before strengthening management and flourishing creation, our team will become more and more dispersed, and our cause will be delayed. Therefore, the reform of the cultural system must be steadfast and proceed step by step; the management of cultural work must be strengthened and cannot be relaxed. The system is important and fundamental, but the system cannot replace everything. A good system must have strict and scientific management to fully bring out its advantages. In the process of cultural system reform, many new problems will inevitably arise. To ensure the smooth progress of the reform, management must also be strengthened. Without strict management, not only will the reform not proceed in an orderly manner, but it will also give those who take advantage of the reform loopholes an opportunity, thus destroying the achievements of the reform and delaying or even ruining a group of talented people. Scientific management is both a guarantee for the smooth progress of the reform and one of the goals of the reform. We must dialectically unite reform and management, promote management through reform, and ensure and deepen reform through management. In the current situation where many chaotic phenomena have appeared in the cultural market, strengthening management is particularly important. Specifically, we can start from three aspects: first, focus on key areas, not only to investigate and ban the sources of those messy publications, books, and audio-visual products, but also to investigate and ban the sources. Second, manage by law, use law to protect culture, and gradually bring cultural management into the rule of law. Third, clarify the division of labor among various departments, each doing its own job, and jointly managing.

In summary, the new situation of reform and opening up and modernization construction has put forward higher requirements for cultural work and brought many new topics for the Party's leadership of cultural work. All levels of the Party organization should, under the guidance of the Party's basic line, use the Marxist standpoint and method to seriously study the laws unique to cultural work, achieve scientific leadership, and ensure that the Party's line, principles, and policies are correctly implemented in cultural work. The Party's leadership should closely connect with cultural workers, listen to their voices, care about their difficulties, enhance unity in the cultural circle, fully tap their wisdom and creativity, produce works and talents, and provide more excellent spiritual products for the people, flourishing socialist cultural undertakings.

    加强改善党的领导　正确执行文化政策
    孙家正
    加强和改善党委对文化工作的领导，贯彻执行好党对文化工作的方针政策，是社会主义精神文明建设中一个十分重要的问题。
    党对文化工作的领导，最根本的是坚持党的十三大制定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，保证文化工作的正确方向，发展、繁荣社会主义文化事业。也就是说，要从政治原则、政治方向上加强领导。这是实行党政分开后党委在领导文化工作方面应当明确的主要职责。十一届三中全会以来进行社会主义现代化建设的实践告诉我们：只有一贯地、坚定不移地坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，只有把这两个基本点水乳交融地渗透在实际工作中，体现在改革和建设事业的各个方面，才有希望把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家。社会主义文化事业既是我们新时期奋斗目标的重要组成部分，又是保证实现这个目标的重要手段，因此，坚决地贯彻执行党的基本路线，是社会主义文化工作的本质要求。党委在党政职能分开以后既不能去代替政府管理文化的职能，去包办群众文艺团体的活动，使自己陷入具体事务之中，影响了政治领导；也不能撒手不管，放弃领导。党委集中力量于政治原则、政治方向的领导，就能在宏观上保证文化工作朝着正确的方向发展。
    那么，党委怎样加强对文化工作的政治领导呢？从这些年的实践看，有几个关系要认真处理好。
    一、“二为”方向与“双百”方针的关系
    为人民服务，为社会主义服务，体现了社会主义文化的质的规定性，是整个文化建设的大方向。忽视文化“二为”的根本方向，就可能导致社会主义文化自身价值的失落，造成精神产品的变质。社会主义文化是为人民大众服务的，这就决定了其必须满足各个层次的人民群众在精神生活上丰富多样的需求，即要求文化工作者以其独特的个性创造出各种题材、各种风格的精神产品，用美好的精神食粮去丰富我们的文化市场，去陶冶人们的情操，激发人们建设新生活的热情。这也就是说，只有实行了百花齐放、百家争鸣的方针，社会主义文化事业才能有真正的繁荣，也才能满足人民群众日益增长的精神文化生活需要。百花齐放、百家争鸣，是文化艺术发展的内在规律，一花独放，冷冷清清，就会窒息文化艺术的生命力。所以，坚持“二为”方向，实行“双百”方针，二者缺一不可。离开了“二为”，“双百”就失去了方向；离开了“双百”，“二为”就是一句无法实现的空话。
    对在文艺创作中提倡“主旋律”的问题，一直有争论。提倡主旋律，这是否与执行“双百”方针发生矛盾呢？我认为是不矛盾的。我们讲的“主旋律”，就是在中国共产党的领导下，我国11亿人民遵循党在社会主义初级阶段的基本路线，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，积极进行建设有中国特色的社会主义的伟大实践。这个“主旋律”是现时代中国社会的客观存在，并不是哪个人主观臆造出来的。文艺要反映时代、反映客观生活，就不能无视这个主旋律的存在。“主旋律”决不是单调的，它包含了丰富的内容。文艺工作者当然有表现自己内心世界的自由，但是，文艺工作者不能没有社会责任感和历史使命感。文艺工作者应该深入生机勃勃、纷纭复杂的现实生活，了解、熟悉、体验各种人物的内心世界，通过自己创造性的艺术实践，表达人民的心声，让自己的脉搏与时代的脉搏一起跳动。我国改革开放正处于新旧体制交替的大变动时期，社会生活、民族心理都处于迅捷、复杂、丰富、斑斓多姿的变化之中，这是时代给予文艺工作者的一种前所未有的历史机遇。倘若文艺工作者们能把握并深刻揭示这一变化，就一定能创作出发人深思、激人奋进的优秀作品，就有可能出现大的传世之作。如果远离生活、淡化生活、与千载难逢的历史机遇失之交臂，将会后悔莫及。提倡文艺创作反映时代的主旋律，并不排斥其它题材的作品，一切健康有益以至某些无害的作品都可包容于社会主义文化宏大的交响乐之中。提倡主旋律，也不是要文艺家们只唱“赞歌”。实质上，问题的关键不在于歌颂还是揭露、微笑还是皱眉，重要之点在于是否真正把握住为社会主义、为人民服务的方向，是否真实地反映了时代前进的步伐。歌颂也好、暴露也好，都应该以推动社会的进步为出发点。总之，提倡主旋律，并不是要搞行政干预，更不是不要“双百”方针，而是希望文艺工作者不失时机地把握历史机遇，写出各具风采的无愧于时代的大作品来，这与文艺家们孜孜以求的目标是完全一致的。
    二、民族文化与外来文化的关系
    文化是全人类共有的财富。无论任何一种有民族特色的文化，都可以说是对人类社会的一项贡献，我们必须尊重它、学习它。我们必须珍惜时代赋予的历史性契机，坚持实行开放政策，认真吸取外来文化中一切有益的东西丰富我们的民族文化。但是，目前有一种倾向值得注意，有些人对中华民族的传统文化采取一种轻视，竭力贬损、一概否定的态度，这不仅极大地伤害了同胞们的民族自尊心，还有可能把社会主义新文化的建设引入歧途。文化的根基和主流应该是本国的富有民族特色的东西，引进外来文化只是为了丰富、完善和壮大自己。在对待民族文化与外来文化的关系上，不能陷入任何一种盲目性。要用马克思主义的立场、观点和方法，敢于和善于批判、否定、摒弃传统文化中的糟粕，坚持发扬传统文化中的精华；敢于和善于批判、否定、摒弃外来文化中落后腐朽的东西，吸收其进步的、有益的东西。从而，在批判地继承传统文化，批判地吸收外来文化的基础上，促进中华民族社会主义的新文化的发展和兴旺。
    三、社会效益与经济效益的关系
    精神产品的基本功能是对人们的精神产生影响，它与物质产品是有区别的，因此，不能不十分重视它的社会效益。我们不能要求文化工作者只是为经济效益生产精神产品，不能笼统地用经济效益的高低去衡量文化部门工作的好坏。如果把商品经济规律和商品交换原则简单地照搬到文化艺术的生产中，在金钱的逼迫和诱惑下，社会主义文化艺术事业势必要走上邪路，势必导致艺术产品自身价值的失落、变质，一些对社会无益甚至有害的东西势必会迅速繁衍。这已不是危言耸听，而是触目惊心的现实。当然，在文化工作中确实有一个经济效益的问题。文化部门由于经济上的困难而严重影响了精神产品的生产，于是不得不把一部分注意力放到经济效益方面的现象也是客观存在的。因此，我们在提倡重视文化工作的社会效益的前提下，应当重视对文化建设的投入，同时，科学地研究文化经营方面的问题，提高文化工作的经济效益。但是，当着经济效益与社会效益发生冲突时，应该毫不犹豫地将社会效益放在第一位，任何时候、任何情况下都决不能以牺牲社会效益为代价来获取经济效益。四、改革与管理的关系
    文化工作的改革，包括体制改革、制度改革、改革业务等，对于文化事业的发展来说都已经是十分紧迫的任务。比如艺术表演团体的改革可以说到了不改革就难以生存的地步。文化工作改革的根本目的，是为了充分解放文化领域的生产力，繁荣社会主义文化事业。几年来，文化改革的舆论造的不算小，但改革的步子十分艰难。与此同时，文化管理处于一种相当混乱的状态。因此，坚持改革和加强管理，成为当前两者缺一不可的紧迫任务。旧体制存在严重的弊端，新体制有许多优越性，这是无容置疑的。但是，新旧体制交替要有个过程。如果一心只想等体制改革好了以后再来加强管理，再来繁荣创作，那我们的队伍就会越带越散，我们的事业就会被贻误。所以，文化体制的改革要坚定不移，一步一个脚印地向前走；文化工作的管理要加强，一点也不能放松。体制是重要的，带根本性的，但体制并不能代替一切。好的体制必须有严格的科学的管理。才能充分发挥出优越性。在文化体制改革过程中，必然会出现许多新的问题，为了保证改革的顺利进行，也必须加强管理，没有严格的管理，不仅改革不能有秩序地进行，而且还会使一些钻改革空子的人有机可乘，从而毁掉改革的成果，耽误甚至葬送一批很有才华的人才。科学管理，既是改革赖以顺利进行的保证，又是改革所要达到的目的之一。要把改革与管理辩证地统一起来，通过改革促进管理，通过管理保障和深化改革。当前在文化市场上出现许多混乱现象的情况下，加强管理尤为重要。具体来说，可以从三个方面入手：一是抓重点，对那些乌七八糟的刊物、图书、音像制品，不仅要查摊点，更要查禁来源。二是依法管理，以法治文，以法护文，把文化管理逐步纳入法治轨道。三是各部门明确分工，各司其职，齐抓共管。
    总之，改革开放和现代化建设的新形势，对文化工作提出了更高的要求，也给党对文化工作的领导带来了许多新的课题。党的各级组织都应该在党的基本路线指导下，运用马克思主义的立场和方法，认真研究文化工作特有的规律，实现科学的领导，保证党的路线、方针、政策在文化工作中得到正确的贯彻执行。党的领导要密切与文化工作者的联系，倾听他们的呼声，关心他们的疾苦，增进文化界的团结，充分发挥他们的智慧和创造性，出作品，出人才，为人民提供更多优秀的精神产品，繁荣社会主义文化事业。
