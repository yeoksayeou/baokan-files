In Chengdu, on Jianshe Road, there is a research institute that was once unnoticed but has recently gained attention. This is the National Machinery Commission Chengdu Welding Machine Research Institute. The institute has gained attention not just for its clean courtyard, bright research rooms, and beautiful dormitory buildings, nor just for the major scientific and technological achievements and economic pure income of 1.8 million yuan it has realized in the past two years. More importantly, the 400 employees of the institute are all in high spirits, eager to contribute to scientific research. The institute's cohesion not only "attracts" its own employees but also draws in technical personnel from other units.

Where does this cohesion come from? The institute's director, Li Jian Guo, said, "We must not only understand and care for technical personnel but also, based on actual conditions, meet their basic needs and create a good spiritual and material living environment to attract and fully utilize their enthusiasm and creativity."

In addressing the living needs of employees, they focused on solving the "three-children" problem: money, housing, and children. In the past two years, under the premise of improving scientific research and production and economic benefits, the per capita income of the entire institute has increased at a rate higher than the price increase index, reaching the upper-middle level of urban residents in Chengdu. The institute raised 1.5 million yuan to build three dormitory buildings, significantly improving the living conditions of employees. For employees' children entering colleges and universities, the institute provides a certain amount of subsidy, covering one-third of the tuition for self-funded students and providing loans for another third, helping parents reduce their burden. The institute also ensures the proper placement of children seeking employment. When certain daily necessities are in short supply in the market, the institute actively finds ways to help employees purchase them, eliminating their worries. When someone goes to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places on business, the institute asks them to visit employees' children studying in local universities, relieving the parents' concerns. Retired employees are also well taken care of. For those who are ill, the institute sends someone to take care of them, making the employees see a stable future and work harder.

When material needs are basically met, spiritual needs become prominent, with the first being the need for emotional exchange between people. They regard this as an important part of spiritual civilization construction, insisting on a weekly study session to learn the policies and guidelines of the Party and the state, and to propagate the correct outlook on life. They actively carry out evaluation activities, commend the advanced, and reward the excellent. They organize various forms of cultural and sports activities according to local conditions. After repeated discussions with employees, they established the institute's spirit of "unity, progress, efficiency, and innovation" as the spiritual pillar to enhance cohesion. In such an atmosphere, everyone does not become petty-minded just because they are wealthy. The relationship between comrades is more harmonious than before. Communist Party members actively play a model role, attracting the majority of senior technical personnel to join their ranks. A senior engineer said, "Becoming a senior engineer means maturity in business, while joining the Party signifies political maturity."

People emphasize the spirit of the master, but how to respect the status of the "master"? The institute insists on good democratic management of the staff and representative assembly, improving the transparency of the institute's work. Before making any major decisions, the institute holds a staff and representative assembly to discuss and decide, fully following the mass line. The institute's leaders also frequently hold democratic dialogue meetings with employees, allowing them to speak freely, understand the institute's affairs, and exercise their rights as masters. Leaders at all levels never scold people in any situation, respecting the employees' self-respect and dignity.

Everyone has their own ideals and desires to express themselves. After the reform, the implementation of bidding and contracting provided this opportunity. The institute formulated technical and economic contracting targets for four departments and publicly invited bids. Twelve cadres and employees participated in the bidding, and after examination, defense, and public opinion surveys, the successful bidders were determined. They then selected their assistants, and the original department cadres were automatically dismissed. Last year, the institute implemented a second-level contracting based on professional groups. Ninety professional groups with over 100 people participated in the contracting. The economic benefits brought by contracting have stimulated everyone's enthusiasm, while the unity of responsibility, rights, and interests has provided everyone with the opportunity to showcase their talents. Everyone has targets and pressure, and they actively seek topics in economic construction. They have already established horizontal cooperation with over 60 factories, schools, and research institutes nationwide, shortening the development cycle of new products.

The facts of the institute tell us that people are the key factor in the success or failure of reform. If the leaders of any unit do not understand the material and spiritual needs of the masses and genuinely solve their difficulties, they cannot fully utilize their talents and achieve success in reform.

    成都电焊机研究所如何创造团结向上的气氛——
    理解是凝聚力之所在
    本报记者　马在新
    在成都市建设路上，有一个以往不为人注意，近年来却令人刮目相看的研究所，这就是国家机械委成都电焊机研究所。令人刮目相看，不只是该所整洁的庭院、明亮的研究室和漂亮的宿舍楼，也不只是这两年每年都取得多项重大科技成果和实现经济纯收入180万元，更重要的是该所400名员工人人心情舒畅，个个愿为科研出力，研究所的凝聚力不仅“吸”住了本所员工，而且引来外单位科技人员。
    凝聚力从何而来？该所所长李建国说：“不仅要理解和关心科技人员，更要从实际出发满足他们的基本需要，创造良好的精神和物质生活环境，才能吸引住他们，并充分发挥他们的积极性和创造性。”
    在解决职工生活需要时，他们把重点放在解决票子、房子、儿子“三子”问题上。这两年在科研生产和经济效益提高的前提下，全所人均收入增长幅度大于物价增长指数，比实行承包前人均总收入增长一半，达到成都市居民中上等生活水平。所里自筹150万元修建了3幢宿舍楼，大大改善了员工的住房条件。员工子女进入大中学校，所里都给予一定补助，对自费上大学的补助1／3，贷款1／3，帮助家长减轻负担。所里还对子女就业进行了妥善安置。有时市场上某些日用品紧缺，所里就积极想办法帮助职工购买，免去他们的后顾之忧。有人去北京、上海等地出差，所里就委托他们去看望在当地大学读书的员工子女，免去家长悬念。所里的离退休人员也得到妥善的照顾，对一些患病者所里派专人去照料，这使在职员工看到自己稳定的未来，从而更加努力工作。
    当物质的需求基本满足后，精神需求就突出出来，首先便是人与人间的情感交流的需要。他们将此作为精神文明建设的重要内容，坚持每周一次的学习制度，学习党和国家的方针政策，宣传正确的人生观；积极开展评比活动，表扬先进，奖励优秀；因地制宜开展多种形式的文体活动；并经员工反复讨论，确立“团结、进取、高效、创新”的所风，作为增强凝聚力的精神支柱。在这样一种氛围里，大家并没有因为富裕了，就钻到钱眼里去斤斤计较，同志间关系比以前更为融洽。共产党员积极发挥模范作用，吸引大多数高级技术人员到自己队伍中来。一位高工说：“当了高工意味着业务上的成熟，入了党则标志着政治上的成熟。”
    人们强调主人翁精神，但如何尊重“主人”的地位？该所坚持搞好职代会的民主管理，提高所务工作透明度。所里每次做重大决策前，都召开职代会讨论决定，充分走群众路线。所领导与员工还经常召开民主对话会，让员工畅所欲言，了解所务情况，行使主人权力。各级领导在任何场合都决不训人，尊重员工的自尊心和人格。
    每个人都有自己的理想和表现自己的欲望。改革以后，实行招标承包给了人们这种机会。该所制定出4个部门的技术经济承包目标公开招标。12名干部和群众投标，经考核、答辩及民意测验确定中标人，再由他们确定助手，原各部门干部即自行免职。去年该所又以专业组为单位实行二级承包，9个专业组100余人参加承包。承包带来的经济效益调动了大家的干劲，而责权利的一致又给大家提供了施展才能的机会。人人有指标、个个有压力，他们主动到经济建设中寻找课题，已同全国60多个厂校、研究所实行横向联合，缩短了新产品开发周期。
    该所的事实告诉我们，人是改革成败的关键因素，任何单位的领导者如果不熟悉群众的物质及精神需求，切实解决他们的困难，就不能充分发挥他们的才干，也不能取得改革的成功。
