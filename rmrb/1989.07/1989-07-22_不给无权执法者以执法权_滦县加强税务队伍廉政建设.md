Luan County in Hebei Province has focused on the integrity building of law enforcement and supervision departments in its integrity building efforts. By not granting enforcement power to those without authority, it has achieved noticeable results.

Luan County has 24 large and small markets. For many years, market transaction taxes have been collected by 175 farmers hired by the tax bureau to collect taxes on market days. Many of these farmers assisting in tax collection are not clear about tax laws and policies. When they exercise tax law enforcement powers, they often engage in arbitrary levies, use taxes for personal gain, and shirk responsibilities. This not only results in the state collecting less tax revenue but also damages the seriousness of tax laws. After learning about these issues, the county committee and county government promptly instructed the tax bureau to address them appropriately. In the first half of this year, the Luan County tax bureau decided to dismiss all farmers assisting in tax collection at small markets and have tax bureau staff directly collect taxes at these markets. For large markets, due to the current shortage of tax bureau staff, some were dismissed, leaving only 62 with good qualifications to assist tax bureau staff in collecting taxes at these markets. For tax officials who uphold the law and take responsibility, the county committee and county government promptly commend them. For those who shirk responsibilities and use their power for personal gain, they are given serious criticism and education, and even disciplinary actions. This not only increased market tax revenue by 50% compared to the same period last year but also strengthened the integrity building of the tax collection team.

    不给无权执法者以执法权
    滦县加强税务队伍廉政建设
    本报讯　河北省滦县在廉政建设中，抓好执法、监督部门的廉政建设，不给无权执法者以执法权，收到了明显效果。
    滦县有大小集市24个，多年来集市贸易税由税务部门雇佣的175名农民负责上集征税。许多协助征税的农民，对税收法律政策不清，在代行执行税法权时，常常发生乱征乱罚、以税谋私、不负责任等问题，既使国家少得了税收，又损害税法的严肃性。县委、县政府了解这些情况后，及时责成税务局予以妥善解决。今年上半年，滦县税务局决定将在小集市帮助征税的农民全部辞退，改由税务干部直接上市征税。对大集市，限于目前税务干部人员不够用，先辞退一部分，只留下62名素质好的，由税务干部带着上集市征税。对奉公执法、敢于负责的税务人员，县委、县政府及时予以表彰；对敷衍塞责、以权谋私者，给予严肃的批评教育，直至处分。这样，不仅使今年上半年集市税收比去年同期增加了50％，也加强了税收队伍的廉政建设。
