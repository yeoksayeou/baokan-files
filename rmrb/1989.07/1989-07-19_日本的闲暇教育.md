The rapid development of science and technology has significantly boosted social productivity, leading to a substantial increase in leisure time for workers. The study of leisure time and leisure education has drawn the attention of some industrialized countries.

Japan was one of the first countries to research and explore leisure education. With continuous development in practice, Japan has formed its unique system of leisure education.

Since the early 1970s, influenced by the international trend of lifelong education, the Japanese government has placed great importance on leisure education. At that time, the Central Education Council and the Central Economic Council of Japan jointly formulated the "New Economic and Social Development Plan." This plan stated that "leisure education is an important means of re-educating adults and improving national quality to adapt to the rapidly changing times." It also pointed out that leisure education should cover all aspects of national activities and promote the comprehensive and harmonious development of the people.

Based on the differences in the objects, content, and methods of leisure education activities, the Japanese government implements leisure education in a diversified manner, providing convenient conditions for citizens to receive good education during their leisure time.

1. **Citizens' Halls**: According to Japanese law, citizens' halls are established by municipal governments, and most municipalities have one or more citizens' halls. These halls are effective centers for implementing leisure education in Japan. Their functions include providing various cultural and educational activities for adult citizens in the city and town, holding lectures or meetings on educational and cultural issues as needed, and organizing cultural and sports activities.

By the end of last year, citizens' halls had spread throughout Japan, with a total of about 18,000.

2. **Libraries and Museums**: These institutions collect, preserve, display, and lend various books, specimens, and materials, providing the information, books, and materials necessary for improving cultural literacy for those receiving leisure education. These libraries and museums also regularly hold book report meetings, calligraphy and painting appreciation meetings, and picture and material exhibitions.

By 1986, there were 135 public libraries and 1,630 museums nationwide in Japan.

3. **Radio and Television**: Due to the widespread use of mass media, Japan has emphasized the role of radio and television in implementing leisure education. As early as the 1970s, Japanese radio and television stations had special programs on social leisure education. Today, the content and scope of leisure education special programs and lectures are more extensive. These programs and lectures pay attention to age differences and can meet the actual needs of different levels. For example, the content of women's leisure education programs mainly includes early childhood family education, family life and health knowledge, beauty and makeup, contemporary women's issues, and women's movement history. The content of elderly leisure education programs mainly includes health and longevity knowledge, elderly nutrition and health care, understanding and views on social changes, and how to communicate with the younger generation. Currently, these radio and television programs and lectures are organized, including recruiting students, distributing teaching materials and reference materials, and sometimes sending teachers to various teaching points to guide students. Those who pass the graduation exam are issued a graduation certificate. Therefore, leisure education programs and lectures on radio and television are very popular among Japanese people and are known as the "encyclopedia of leisure education."

    日本的闲暇教育
    余逸群
    科学技术的迅速发展，促进了社会生产力的大大提高，导致了劳动者闲暇时间的大量增加，对闲暇时间和闲暇教育的研究引起了一些工业发达国家的关注。
    日本是最早研究和探索闲暇教育的国家，并随着实践的不断发展，形成了自己独特的闲暇教育体系。
    从70年代初起，由于受终身教育国际思潮的影响，日本政府就极为重视闲暇教育。当时，日本中央教育审议会和中央经济审议会联合制定了《新经济与社会发展规划》，此规划认为“闲暇教育是对成年人进行再教育，提高国民素质，以适应迅速变化的时代的重要途径”，并指出闲暇教育要面向国民活动的各个方面，促进国民全面和谐的发展。
    根据闲暇教育活动的对象、内容和方法的不同，日本政府实施闲暇教育也具有多样化的特点，为国民都能在闲暇之时受到良好教育提供了便利条件。
    一、公民馆　根据日本的法律，公民馆由各市政府组建，大多数市政府都有一个以上的公民馆。这些公民馆是日本实施闲暇教育的有效中心，其职能是为市镇成人市民提供各种文化教育活动，并视实际需要举办有关的教育与文化问题的讲座或集会，开展文娱和体育活动。
    截止到去年底，公民馆已遍及日本各地，总数已达18000个左右。
    二、图书馆和博物馆　它们以收集、保管、展示、借贷各种图书、标本和资料等为业务，为受闲暇教育的人们提供提高文化教养所必须的情报、图书和资料。这些图书馆和博物馆还定期召开读书报告会、字画鉴赏会、图片资料展览会等。
    到1986年，日本全国的公共图书馆共有135个，博物馆共有1630所。
    三、广播、电视　由于大众传播媒介的普及，日本在实施闲暇教育过程中注重发挥广播和电视的作用。早在70年代初，日本的广播、电视台就开辟了社会闲暇教育的专题节目。今天，闲暇教育的专题节目和讲座的内容与范围更为广泛，这些节目和讲座很注意年龄层次的差别，同时又能适应不同层次的实际需要。例如：妇女闲暇教育节目的内容主要是幼儿家庭教育、家庭生活与健康知识、美容与化妆、当今妇女问题与妇女运动史，等等。老年人闲暇教育节目的内容主要有健康长寿知识、老人的饮食与保健、对社会变化的理解和看法、怎样与青年一代沟通思想观念，等等。现在，这些广播和电视的节目及讲座都是有组织进行的，包括招收学员，发放教材和参考资料，有时还派教员到各教学点对学员进行辅导，毕业考试合格者发给毕业证书。因此，广播、电视中的闲暇教育节目、讲座深受日本人的欢迎，被称之为“闲暇教育的大百科全书”。
