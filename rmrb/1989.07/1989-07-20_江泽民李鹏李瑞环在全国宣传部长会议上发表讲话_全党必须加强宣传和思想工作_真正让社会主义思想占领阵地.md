The Party must strengthen propaganda and ideological work to truly occupy the ideological front.

The People's Daily, Beijing, July 20 (Reporters Li Jiguo, Xinhua News Agency reporter Sun Benyao)

At the national propaganda department conference, General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee Jiang Zemin, and members of the Politburo Standing Committee Li Peng and Li Ruihuan emphasized that after the suppression of the turmoil and counterrevolutionary rebellion, the entire Party must highly value and strengthen the work on the propaganda and ideological front. The current task of ideological and political work is to study and propagate the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Deng Xiaoping's important speeches, to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, to carry out in-depth education on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and to strengthen propaganda work.

Jiang Zemin said that through this student movement, turmoil, and counterrevolutionary rebellion, one of the lessons we have learned is that the Party must attach great importance to ideological work. The propaganda front is generally good, but it has exposed the problem of the serious spread of bourgeois liberalization. Deng Xiaoping has been talking about opposing bourgeois liberalization almost every year from 1980 to now, but mainly due to Zhao Ziyang's responsibility, it has not been well implemented, and even slid further in the direction of bourgeois liberalization. We must truly let socialist ideology occupy the ideological front and carry out the struggle against bourgeois liberalization to the end.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that we must make the people of the whole country understand the economic situation, both to boost confidence and to see the difficulties, and must strive hard. We should pay attention to propagating the fine traditions of the Chinese nation, such as national spirit and thrift. This propaganda should be targeted and effective.

Jiang Zemin said that many young people are confused in their thoughts: Why does China have to take the socialist road? Why must the Communist Party lead? We must answer this question deeply and convincingly from the combination of theory and practice. In addition, how to understand the issues of democracy, freedom, and human rights, we must conduct enlightenment education for young students in propaganda. We must guide people to observe, analyze, and handle problems with the standpoint, viewpoint, and method of Marxism-Leninism.

He also emphasized that all levels of Party committees must strengthen ideological and political work. Enterprise Party committees must take on the responsibility of ideological and political work, establish necessary functional institutions, and build a lean and efficient cadre of full-time political workers.

Li Peng said at the meeting that through this struggle against turmoil and the suppression of the rebellion, the entire Party has come to recognize the importance of the propaganda and ideological front. The long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization is one of the main reasons for the turmoil and rebellion. In this struggle, the wrong guidance of news propaganda is a lesson worth learning. In the future, not only the Party Central Committee and the State Council, but also all levels of Party committees and governments must attach great importance to and strengthen news propaganda work. Government departments should regularly report the situation, propose propaganda requirements, and provide necessary manpower and material support. Through the efforts and cooperation of comrades on the propaganda front, we can do a better job of the government's various tasks.

Li Peng said that the suppression of the counterrevolutionary rebellion has achieved decisive victory, but we still face arduous tasks. There are still many ideological problems among the masses that require a large amount of in-depth and detailed ideological education work. Among them, upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and clearly opposing bourgeois liberalization is a long-term task for the propaganda and ideological front.

Li Peng said that in this struggle, the vast majority of intellectuals have performed well and are a force that our Party can rely on. As for the few scoundrels among the intellectuals, they do not represent the patriotic and pro-Party and pro-socialist intellectuals of our country. The Party's policy towards intellectuals will not change because of this counterrevolutionary rebellion.

Li Peng also emphasized the need to strengthen external propaganda work.

Li Ruihuan proposed in his speech that we should seize the current favorable opportunity to strengthen propaganda work. He said that in recent years, Zhao Ziyang has actually taken a bourgeois liberalization attitude towards our Party, causing the Party's work to be seriously weakened. The Party's propaganda work has faced a crisis, many places have disbanded their teams, lost their positions, and thoughts are in chaos. Broad masses of propaganda cadres have worked diligently under very difficult conditions, especially in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the rebellion, they have stood firm, held high the banner, fought day and night on the front line, and defended the interests of the Party and the people.

He said that after stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion, the propaganda and ideological front faces a complex situation and arduous tasks. While doing a few practical things that the people will be happy and satisfied with in the political and economic fields, we must also carry out a large amount of in-depth and detailed ideological education work. Using the spirit of the Fourth Plenum to help people clarify facts, distinguish right from wrong, understand theory, and straighten out emotions, we must unify thoughts from confusion and bewilderment, invigorate spirits, and concentrate forces. The urgent task of the propaganda and ideological front at present is to correct the theoretical and ideological issues that have been confused by bourgeois liberalization in recent years, to return to the original and clear the source, and to provide a good public opinion environment and scientific theoretical support for reform and opening up, rectification and adjustment, economic construction, Party building, spiritual civilization construction, and democratic and legal system construction.

Li Ruihuan pointed out that it is a very favorable time to strengthen propaganda work now. All levels of leaders and cadres on the propaganda and ideological front must recognize the situation, invigorate their spirits, seize the opportunity, and ride the momentum to strive to do a good job of the Party's propaganda work.

Li Ruihuan said that we must do a few practical things to strengthen ideological and political work.

In 1983, Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "The entire ideological front needs to be strengthened. We must seriously put this issue before the whole Party, and put it on the important agenda of the Central and local Party committees at all levels." The current task of ideological and political work is to take practical and effective measures to study and propagate the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Comrade Xiaoping's important speeches, to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. We must carry out in-depth education on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and the two basic points of reform and opening up. In view of the lessons of the past relatively long period of not consistently upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and not resolutely and thoroughly opposing bourgeois liberalization, we must now clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization and strengthen the positive voice of the Four Cardinal Principles.

He pointed out that ideological and political work has a problem of improvement, but the first issue is whether it is needed or not. Zhao Ziyang, under the pretext of "adaptation," proposed "reformation," which actually negated the Party's fine traditions of ideological and political work and abolished ideological and political work. To quickly reverse the weak situation of ideological and political work, we must now grasp it tightly and concretely, grasp practical things, and do practical things. First, organize forces to write a batch of articles, books, and textbooks on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Second, we must create necessary conditions for the grassroots to strengthen ideological and political work. Broad grassroots, especially state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, are the foundation of society and the key to ideological and political work. We must clarify the position and role of enterprise Party organizations in ideological and political work. Enterprise Party organizations must regard ideological and political work as their central task and primary responsibility, and Party secretaries must use their main energy to grasp ideological and political work. This will also help enterprise Party organizations better play their guaranteeing and supervising roles in the implementation of the factory director responsibility system. We must stabilize and replenish the cadre team of political workers at the grassroots level. Enterprises can be equipped with full-time political workers at a ratio of 1% of the total number of workers. Political workers, like other professional cadres, should also be evaluated for professional titles. The Central Committee has agreed to do this, and relevant departments should quickly formulate specific evaluation plans.

Third, we must thoroughly eliminate reactionary, pornographic publications and audio-visual products. At present, reactionary publications that advocate bourgeois liberalization, and vulgar and low-level publications and audio-visual products that spread obscenity, violence, murder, and feudal superstitions are rampant and difficult to eradicate, causing serious spiritual pollution and poisoning people's souls, especially corrupting the younger generation. We must thoroughly investigate and rectify the book and audio-visual markets. Once these "spiritual opium" are found, they must be confiscated and destroyed without mercy, and the leaders of the publishing and selling units must be held accountable, heavily fined economically, and given disciplinary and administrative penalties, and even legal responsibility must be pursued. We must take the method of cutting off the root to thoroughly clean up and rectify the over-many and over-abundant newspapers, periodicals, and publishing houses.

Li Ruihuan said that the news front must strictly follow the Party's propaganda discipline. The "Several Provisions on Party Life" clearly stipulates: "Party newspapers must unconditionally propagate the Party's line, principles, policies, and political views," and party members "are absolutely not allowed to publish speeches in newspapers and broadcasts that are contrary to the decisions of the Central Committee, nor to spread opinions among the masses that are contrary to the Party's line, principles, policies, and resolutions. This is Party discipline." The news sector must carry out an in-depth struggle against bourgeois liberalization, especially to expose the hypocrisy and reactionary nature of bourgeois press freedom, to solve the problem of the consistency of the Party nature and the people's nature of news work, and to fundamentally rectify the political direction of news propaganda. We must work hard to study how to make news work adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and operate according to the inherent laws of news, so that news propaganda and the Party's policies and the will of the people can be consistent.

Li Ruihuan emphasized that we must organize the study of Marxist theory well. Those who engage in bourgeois liberalization attack Marxism from a theoretical perspective, spread the theory of "Marxism is outdated," and degrade Marxism to one of the hundred schools of thought, with the purpose of negating the guiding position of Marxism and shaking our theoretical foundation. The major political task facing the whole Party at present is to strengthen the study, propaganda, and research of Marxist theory, to clear up theoretical confusion, and to unify and improve people's ideological understanding.

He said that Marxism is a developing science. When we talk about development, it is to use Marxism, this powerful spiritual weapon for recognizing and transforming the world, to constantly combine it with the changing reality, and to explore answers to new problems. In a certain sense, combining is using, and combining is developing. Summarizing, abstracting, and refining the results of combining, and elevating them to rational cognition, this itself is the development of Marxism. It is absolutely not allowed to use "development" as a name to do the opposite in reality. Some people have not read a few books of Marx and Lenin, and do not even understand the basic knowledge of Marxism, but they want to use some bourgeois theories from the West to negate Marxism, which only exposes their arrogance and ignorance.

Li Ruihuan pointed out that the current focus of studying Marxist theory is to study philosophy. Comrade Chen Yun said: "Studying philosophy well is beneficial for life." Marxist philosophy is the most scientific and complete worldview and methodology that humanity has so far, and is a "great tool of cognition." He also emphasized that all levels of leading cadres must seriously study the theoretical views and mass line theory of Marxism.

He said that we must adapt to the needs of cadres and masses at different levels, list the must-read books of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must establish and improve the cadre learning system, specify learning time, implement the rotation training method, so that cadres at all levels, especially middle and high-level cadres, have the opportunity to systematically study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. We must regard having Marxist theoretical literacy as one of the signs of cadre revolutionization and as a criterion for selecting and appointing cadres. We must carry out Marxist theoretical research, immediately propose a batch of topics, divided by the Central and local governments, and strive to produce a batch of research results with relatively high levels within one or two years. I hope that leading comrades at all levels, especially comrades on the ideological and theoretical front, will invest in the study of Marxist theory with full enthusiasm and great perseverance. With this, our propaganda work and work in all aspects will definitely have great hope and improvement.

Li Ruihuan said that we must strengthen the ideological and organizational construction of the propaganda team. To adapt to the needs of the situation and tasks, we must build a large propaganda team that includes theory, news, literature and art, publishing, and political workers at all levels. Over the decades, our Party has already had such a team. Our propaganda team is generally good. In recent years, the propaganda and ideological front has made some progress and achievements in reform and opening up, which is commendable. But we must also see the existing problems. Our propaganda team, whether in quantity or quality, is far from meeting the needs of the situation and tasks. In recent years, bourgeois liberalization has seriously spread in the theoretical, news, literary and artistic, and publishing circles, causing very bad influences. In this turmoil, some people's positions have wavered, and a few who have long been stubbornly insisting on bourgeois liberalization have become the masterminds and organizers behind the turmoil and rebellion. The current priority is to strengthen the rectification of the propaganda team.

He said that Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that mobilizing all positive factors, turning negative factors into positive ones, and jointly building a socialist country is one of our basic policies. We must strictly implement the Party's policy, strictly distinguish between two types of different contradictions, and seriously solve the problem of uniting the majority. We must unite the broad masses of cadres and intellectuals on the propaganda and ideological front under the banner of socialism and patriotism to strive for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

Members of the Politburo Standing Committee and Secretary of the Secretariat Ding Guangen and responsible comrades from relevant departments attended the meeting.

    江泽民李鹏李瑞环在全国宣传部长会议上发表讲话
    全党必须加强宣传和思想工作
    真正让社会主义思想占领阵地
    当前思想政治工作的任务就是要学习、宣传四中全会精神和邓小平同志的重要讲话，统一全党和全国人民的思想，要深入进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，把宣传工作搞上去。这些年，赵紫阳同志实际上是以资产阶级自由化的态度对待我们党，致使党的整个工作被严重的削弱了。为了迅速扭转思想政治工作的薄弱状况，现在必须抓紧抓实，办好三件事。最近几年，资产阶级自由化在理论界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界严重泛滥，造成了很坏的影响。当前，首先要下力量做好宣传队伍的整顿工作。
    本报北京7月20日讯　本报记者李济国、新华社记者孙本尧报道：中共中央总书记江泽民、中央政治局常委李鹏、李瑞环今天在全国宣传部长会议上讲话指出，制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱后，全党必须高度重视和加强宣传、思想战线的工作。当前思想政治工作的任务就是要学习、宣传四中全会精神和邓小平同志的重要讲话，统一全党和全国人民的思想，深入进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，把宣传工作搞上去。
    江泽民说，通过这次学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱，我们得出的教训之一就是全党必须十分重视意识形态工作。宣传战线从总体来讲是好的，但也暴露了资产阶级自由化严重泛滥的问题。邓小平同志从1980年到现在几乎年年讲反对资产阶级自由化，主要由于赵紫阳同志的责任，没有得到很好贯彻，甚至还沿着资产阶级自由化的方向滑下去。我们一定要真正让社会主义思想占领阵地，把反对资产阶级自由化的斗争进行到底。
    江泽民指出，我们要使全国人民了解经济形势，既要鼓舞信心，又要看到困难，必须艰苦奋斗。要注意宣传中华民族的优良传统，例如民族气节、勤俭持家。这些宣传区别对象，有针对性。
    江泽民说，现在不少青年人思想上搞不清楚，中国为什么非要走社会主义道路？为什么非要共产党领导不可。对于这个问题，我们要从理论与实际的结合上进行深入浅出、令人信服的回答。另外，怎样理解民主、自由、人权问题，在宣传上要对青年学生进行启蒙教育。要引导人们用马列主义的立场、观点和方法观察、分析和处理问题。
    他还强调指出，各级党委都要加强思想政治工作。企业党委要把思想政治工作的责任担当起来，要设立必要的职能机构，建立一支精干的专职政工队伍。
    李鹏在会上说，通过这场反对动乱、平息暴乱的斗争，我们全党更加认识到宣传、思想战线的重要性。资产阶级自由化长期泛滥，是发生动乱和暴乱的主要原因之一。在这场斗争中，新闻宣传错误导向的教训是值得记取的。今后，不仅党中央、国务院要高度重视和加强新闻宣传工作，各级党委和政府都要支持宣传思想战线的工作。政府部门要经常通报情况，提出宣传要求，并给予必要的人力、物力的支持。通过宣传战线同志的努力和配合，把我们政府的各项工作做得更好。
    李鹏说，平息反革命暴乱已经取得了决定性的胜利，但是我们仍面临着艰巨的任务，群众中思想问题还不少，需要进行大量的深入细致的思想教育工作。其中坚持四项基本原则、旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化，是宣传、思想战线的长期任务。
    李鹏说，在这场斗争中，绝大部分知识分子的表现是好的，他们是我们党可以信赖的一支队伍。至于知识分子中的极少数败类，并不能代表我国爱国的、拥护党和社会主义的知识分子。党对知识分子的政策不会因这次反革命暴乱而改变。
    李鹏还强调要加强对外宣传工作。
    李瑞环在讲话中提出，要抓住当前有利时机把宣传工作搞上去。他说，这些年，赵紫阳同志实际上是以资产阶级自由化的态度对待我们党，致使党的整个工作被严重地削弱了。党的宣传工作出现了危机，许多地方队伍散了，阵地丢了，思想乱了。广大宣传干部在十分困难的条件下，仍然按照党的正确方针兢兢业业地工作，特别是在制止动乱和平息暴乱中，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明，日夜战斗在第一线，捍卫了党和人民的利益。
    他说，制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱后，宣传、思想战线面临着复杂的局面、艰巨的任务，要在政治、经济领域抓紧办几件让人民高兴、满意的实事的同时，进行大量的深入细致的思想教育工作，用四中全会的精神帮助人们澄清事实、分清是非、弄清理论、理顺情绪，从困惑和迷惘中把思想统一起来，把精神振奋起来，把力量凝聚起来。宣传、思想战线眼下的急迫任务就是，把这些年被资产阶级自由化搞乱了的思想理论问题重新纠正过来，正本清源，为改革开放、治理整顿、经济建设，为党的建设、精神文明建设、民主和法制建设提供良好的舆论环境和科学的理论支持。
    李瑞环指出，把宣传工作搞上去，当前是非常有利的时机。宣传、思想战线上的各级领导、广大干部都要认清形势、振奋精神、把握时机、乘势而上，努力做好党的宣传工作。
    李瑞环说，我们要办好几件加强思想政治工作的实事。
    1983年邓小平同志就指出：“整个思想战线的工作都需要加强。我们要把这个问题郑重地提到全党面前，提到中央和地方各级党委的重要日程上来。”当前，思想政治工作的任务就是采取切实有力的措施，学习、宣传四中全会精神和小平同志的重要讲话，统一全党和全国人民的思想。要深入进行坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放两个基本点的教育。鉴于过去较长时期坚持四项基本原则不一贯，反对资产阶级自由化不坚决、不彻底的教训，当前尤其要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化、强化四项基本原则的正面声音。
    他指出，思想政治工作有一个改进的问题，但第一位的是要不要的问题。赵紫阳借口“适应”，提出“改造”，实际上是否定党的思想政治工作的优良传统，取消思想政治工作。为了迅速扭转思想政治工作的薄弱状况，现在必须抓紧抓实，抓实事、办实事。一是组织力量写出一批坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的论文、书籍和教材书。二是要为基层加强思想政治工作创造必要的条件。广大基层特别是全民所有制大中型企业是社会的基础，也是思想政治工作的重点。要明确企业党组织在思想政治工作中的地位和作用。企业党组织一定要把思想政治工作作为自己的中心任务和首要职责，党委书记要用主要精力抓思想政治工作。这样也有利于在实行厂长负责制的情况下企业党组织更好地发挥保证监督作用。要稳定和充实基层的政工干部队伍。企业可按职工总数1％的比例配备专职政工干部。政工干部也和其他专业干部一样应当评定专业职称。中央已同意这样做，有关部门要抓紧制定具体评定方案。
    三是要彻底扫除反动的、黄色的出版物和音像制品。目前，宣扬资产阶级自由化的反动书刊，传播色情淫秽、暴力凶杀、封建迷信等庸俗低级的书刊和音像制品泛滥成灾，屡禁不绝，造成严重的精神污染，毒害人们的灵魂，腐蚀青少年一代。要彻底清查和整顿书刊和音像市场，这些“精神鸦片”一经发现，就要坚决收缴销毁，并追查出版及批售单位的领导者责任，从重予以经济处罚和党纪、政纪处分，直至追究法律责任。要采取釜底抽薪的办法，对过多过滥的报纸、刊物、出版社进行一次彻底清理和整顿。
    李瑞环说，新闻战线必须严格党的宣传纪律。《关于党内政治生活的若干准则》明确规定：“党的报刊必须无条件地宣传党的路线、方针、政策和政治观点”，党员“绝对不允许在报刊广播的公开宣传中发表同中央的决定相反的言论，也不得在群众中散布与党的路线、方针、政策和决议相反的意见。这是党的纪律”。新闻界要深入开展反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，特别是揭露资产阶级新闻自由的虚伪性和反动性，解决好新闻工作的党性与人民性相一致的问题，从根本上端正新闻宣传的政治方向。我们要下功夫研究，如何使新闻工作做到既坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化，又能按照新闻固有的规律办事，从而使新闻宣传和党的方针政策一致起来，和人民群众的意愿一致起来。
    李瑞环强调指出，一定要组织好马克思主义的理论学习。搞资产阶级自由化的人，从理论上集中攻击马克思主义，散布马克思主义“过时论”，把马克思主义贬低为百家争鸣中的一家，其目的就是否定马克思主义的指导地位，动摇我们的理论基础。当前，摆在全党面前的一个重大政治任务，就是加强马克思主义理论的学习、宣传和研究，廓清理论上的迷雾，统一和提高人们的思想认识。
    他说，马克思主义是发展的科学。我们讲发展，就是运用马克思主义这个认识世界和改造世界的强大精神武器，不断结合变化着的实际，探索解决新问题的答案。从一定意义上讲，结合就是运用，结合就是发展，把结合的成果加以总结、概括、提炼，上升到理性认识，这本身就是发展马克思主义。绝对不允许借“发展”之名行背离之实。有些人没读过几本马列，连起码的马克思主义知识也不懂，就妄图搬用西方一些资产阶级理论来否定马克思主义，只能暴露他们的狂妄与无知。
    李瑞环指出，当前学习马克思主义理论重点是学习哲学。陈云同志说：学好哲学，终身受用。马克思主义哲学是人类迄今为止最科学、最完整的世界观和方法论，是“伟大的认识工具”。他还强调，各级领导干部都要认真学习马克思主义的理论观点和群众路线的理论。
    他说，要适应不同层次干部、群众的需要，列出马列主义，毛泽东思想的必读书目。要建立健全干部学习制度，规定学习时间，实行轮训办法，使各级干部特别是中高级干部有机会系统地学习马列主义、毛泽东思想。要把具备马克思主义理论素养做为干部革命化的标志之一，作为选拔和任用干部的考核标准。要开展马克思主义理论研究，立即动手提出一批选题，由中央和地方分担，力争一、二年内拿出一批有较高水平的研究成果。希望各级领导同志特别是思想理论战线上的同志，以饱满的热情，极大的毅力，投入马克思主义理论学习中来。有了这一条，我们的宣传工作和各个方面的工作就一定会大有希望、大有起色。
    李瑞环说，要加强宣传队伍的思想和组织建设。为了适应形势和任务的需要，必须建设一支包括理论、新闻、文艺、出版和各级政治工作干部在内的宏大的马克思主义的宣传队伍。几十年来，我们党已经有了这样一支队伍。我们的宣传队伍总的讲是好的。这几年，宣传、思想战线在改革开放中取得了不少的进步和成果，是应当肯定的。但也必须看到存在的问题，我们的宣传队伍无论在数量上还是在质量上都远不能适应形势和任务的需要。最近几年，资产阶级自由化在理论界、新闻界、文艺界、出版界严重泛滥，造成了很坏的影响。在这次动乱中，有些人立场发生了动摇，少数长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人成了动乱和暴乱的幕后策划者、组织者。当前首先要下力量做好宣传队伍的整顿工作。
    他说，毛泽东同志指出，调动一切积极因素，化消极因素为积极因素，共同建设社会主义国家，是我们的一个基本方针。一定要严格执行党的政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，认真解决好团结大多数的问题。我们要在社会主义、爱国
  主义的旗帜下，把宣传、思想战线上的广大干部、广大知识分子最大限度地团结起来，为建设有中国特色的社会主义而奋斗。
