In the 1990s and the first decade of the next century, oil will remain the primary source of energy consumption in the world. OPEC is likely to regain its dominance in the oil market by the mid-1990s. This was the consensus among experts at the recent International Energy Conference held in Caracas.

During the 1980s, the international oil market was turbulent. As OPEC's control over the market weakened, oil prices softened, directly affecting the stable development of various national economies. The development and consumption of oil energy, along with its pollution of the natural environment and disruption of ecological balance, have increasingly caused concern. Therefore, as the 1980s draw to a close, people's attention naturally focuses on future trends in energy production and consumption, as well as the direction of the oil market.

With the expansion of national economies, especially the industrialization of developing countries, global energy demand will continue to grow. It is estimated that if all the world's energy demand is converted to oil, by the year 2000, it will increase from the current 1 billion barrels to 1.2 billion barrels, and by 2010, it will further rise to 1.36 billion barrels. However, the rate of energy demand growth in industrialized countries will slow down. An American oil expert pointed out that in recent years, the economic growth of some countries in the Asia-Pacific region has been remarkable. In recent years, half of the increased demand in the oil market has come from this region. In the future, energy demand in this region will continue to rise.

Currently, oil accounts for about half of the world's energy consumption, but oil is a non-renewable resource. Therefore, all countries are actively developing and utilizing new energy sources. The proportion of oil in total energy consumption will gradually decrease. The proportion of natural gas, nuclear energy, hydropower, and other energy sources will gradually increase. However, in the medium term, the changes in the proportions of various energy sources will not be significant. This is mainly due to the recent substantial increase in newly discovered oil reserves. OPEC's survey shows that the world's oil reserves have increased by 40% in the past three years, reaching 99 billion barrels, which can ensure 50 years of extraction and supply. In contrast, new energy sources require time from development and research to formal production and commercial promotion. In terms of cost, price, convenience, practicality, safety, and reliability, new energy sources will find it difficult to compete with oil in the short term.

At this international energy conference, OPEC Secretary-General Subroto made a prediction about the future trend of energy consumption structure. According to the data he provided, currently, oil accounts for 48% of the world's total energy consumption. By 2010, this proportion will decrease to 46%. In the next 20 years, the consumption share of natural gas will increase significantly, rising from 18% to 22%. The share of coal will continue to decrease, from 22% to 21%. The share of nuclear energy and hydropower will reach 11%.

The development of nuclear energy will undoubtedly maintain an expanding trend in the future, but it will remain a controversial issue. There is news that the U.S. Department of Energy is promoting research on controlled nuclear fusion (including magnetic nuclear fusion and laser nuclear fusion), hoping to gradually reduce U.S. dependence on oil through nuclear energy development. However, some in the U.S. are skeptical about whether such costly research can achieve results in the near future, let alone industrial application and commercial promotion. Additionally, the Chernobyl nuclear leak accident in the Soviet Union has not completely dispelled people's doubts about the safety of nuclear energy. Therefore, the development of nuclear energy will be constrained.

A noteworthy view is that OPEC's position in the future oil market may be strengthened. The prediction by the vice president of Italy's Agip Oil Company, Curcio, is somewhat representative. He pointed out that based on the distribution of global oil reserves, by 1998, OPEC's oil production will exceed that of other oil-producing countries. At that time, the production of non-OPEC countries will decrease from the current 29.4 million barrels per day to 27.4 million barrels per day, while OPEC's production will reach 27.8 million barrels per day. By the year 2000, OPEC's daily production will further increase to 33.1 million barrels, while the daily production of non-OPEC countries will decrease to 25.9 million barrels. This situation will lead to an increase in oil prices. John R. Lichtblau, chairman of the U.S. Petroleum Institute, also believes that oil prices will rise by the end of the 1990s. He believes that if Curcio's prediction is accurate, many experts estimate that the oil price in the year 2000 could reach $25 per barrel.

Curcio's analysis is basically consistent with some of OPEC's data. Secretary-General Subroto mentioned that in the world's oil reserves (excluding planned economy countries), OPEC accounts for 84%. At the current production level, non-OPEC countries can only extract oil for 19 years, while OPEC countries can extract oil for 100 years. Subroto estimates that by the year 2000, OPEC's oil production will account for 54% of the world's total production. However, from the current situation, OPEC's short-term goal is still to seek cooperation between oil-producing and consuming countries, cooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC countries, and coordination within OPEC to stabilize oil prices. Some experts also express doubts about Curcio's view. Dennis O'Brien of the U.S. Caltex Oil Company said that whether OPEC can expand its market share depends on many factors, and this prediction is based on many hypothetical conditions. OPEC may have a greater influence in the future, but it will not return to the situation of the 1970s when it dominated the market.

    能源：对下一个十年的展望
    本报记者　朱满庭
    在本世纪的90年代至下世纪的头一个十年内，石油仍是世界能源消费的主要来源，欧佩克很可能在90年代中期以后东山再起，重新在石油市场上发挥主导作用。这是最近在加拉加斯举行的国际能源会议上各国专家比较普遍的看法。
    在80年代里，国际石油市场动荡不已，随着欧佩克对国际市场控制力的削弱，石油价格趋于疲软，直接影响到各国经济的稳定发展，石油能源的开发与消费对自然环境的污染和生态平衡的破坏，也引起人们越来越大的忧虑。因此在80年代即将结束的时候，人们的目光很自然地集中在今后能源生产与消费的趋势，石油市场的走向等问题上。
    随着各国经济规模的扩展，特别是发展中国家工业化程度的提高，世界的能源需求将继续扩大。据估计，全世界的能源需求如都折合成石油计算的话，到2000年，将从现在的1亿桶上升到1.2亿桶，到2010年，将进一步上升到1.36亿桶。但工业化国家对能源需求的增长速度将有所下降。美国的一位石油专家指出，近几年亚太地区一些国家的经济增长令人瞩目，近年来石油市场上需求增加有一半来自这一地区。今后这一地区的能源需求仍将上升。
    世界目前的能源消费中，石油约占一半，但石油是不可再生的能源，因此各国都在积极开发利用新的能源。石油在全部能源消费中所占的比重将逐步下降。天然气、核能、水电等其它能源所占比重则逐步提高。但在中期内，各种能源成分所占比重的变化不会太大。这主要是由于近来新探明的石油储量又有较大幅度增长。欧佩克的调查表明，石油的世界储量在近3年内增加了40％，达到9900亿桶，完全可以保证50年的开采、供给，而新兴能源则从开发研究到正式投产再到商业推广都需要时间，在成本、价格、方便实用、安全可靠等方面，新兴能源一时也难于和石油相比。
    在这次国际能源会议上，欧佩克秘书长苏布罗托对今后的能源消费结构变化趋势作了一个推测。据他提供的数据，现在世界全部能源消费中，石油占48％，到2010年，这个比重将下降到46％。在未来20年内，天然气的消费比重上升较大，将从18％提高到22％。煤炭的比重还将继续下降，从22％降到21％。核能和水电的比重则将达到11％。
    核能的发展今后无疑将保持扩大趋势，但也仍将是个有争议的问题。有消息说，美国能源局正在推动对可控核聚变
  （包括磁核聚变和激光核聚变）的研究工作，希望从核能开发中逐步摆脱美国对石油日益增长的依赖。但美国也有人对这种耗资巨大的研究能否在近期内取得成果表示怀疑，至于其工业应用和商业推广就更是长远的事情了。此外，苏联切尔诺贝利核泄露事故在人们心中造成的对核能安全性的疑虑尚未完全消除。因此核能的发展将受到制约。
    值得注意的一个看法是，欧佩克在未来石油市场中的地位可能加强。意大利阿吉普石油公司副总裁库尔西奥的推测具有一定代表性。他指出，从世界石油储量的分布情况看，到1998年，欧佩克的产油量将超过其它产油国，届时，非欧佩克国家的产量将从目前的日产2940万桶，下降到2740万桶，而欧佩克的产量将达到2780万桶。到2000年，欧佩克的日产量将进一步上升到3310万桶，非欧佩克国家的日产量则要下降到2590万桶。这种情况将使油价上升。美国石油基金会主席约翰·李奇特布劳也认为，到90年代末油价要上升。他认为，如果库尔西奥的推测准确，不少专家估计2000年的油价可能达到每桶25美元。
    库尔西奥的分析与欧佩克的一些数据基本相符，苏布罗托秘书长提到，在全世界（不包括计划经济体制国家）的石油储量中，欧佩克占84％。按目前的生产水平，非欧佩克国家只能开采19年，欧佩克国家却能开采100年。苏布罗托估计，到2000年时，欧佩克的油产量将占世界总产量的54％。不过从目前的情况看，欧佩克的近期目标还是争取产油国与消费国的合作、欧佩克国家与非欧佩克国家合作以及实现欧佩克内部的协调，以便稳定油价。对库尔西奥的看法，也有些专家表示怀疑。美国卡尔德克斯石油公司的丹尼斯·奥布瑞恩说，欧佩克是否能扩大自己在市场上的份额取决于很多因素，这种推测是建立在许多假设条件上的。欧佩克将来有可能发挥更大的影响，但不会出现70年代那种主宰市场的情况了。
