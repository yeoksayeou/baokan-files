The leaders of the three general departments visited and comforted part of the troops of the People's Armed Police who were executing the martial law mission.

Today morning, the Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Yang Baibing, the Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Xu Xin, and Xu Huizhi, the Deputy Director of the General Political Department, Zhou Kety, and the Deputy Director of the General Logistics Department, Zhang Bin, visited and comforted the troops of the People's Armed Police who were executing the martial law mission in the auditorium of the headquarters of the People's Armed Police.

The leaders of the three general departments praised the great contributions made by the People's Armed Police in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Yang Baibing said, "Since the suppression of the turmoil, the People's Armed Police have been fighting on the front line. The facts have proven that the People's Armed Police are a reliable armed force trusted by the Party Central Committee, and they are indeed a mighty and civilized army. On behalf of the three general departments and the martial law command, I thank you."

Yang Baibing pointed out, "Although the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has achieved a decisive victory, we must also see that the counter-revolutionary arrogance of the rioters is still very rampant. Our task is still arduous, and we need to continue to carry forward the spirit of military, police, and civilian cooperation and joint operations, resolutely safeguard the safety of the Party Central Committee, safeguard the great achievements of reform, and safeguard the victory of the Four Modernizations."

    三总部领导慰问武警部队官兵
    赞扬他们为平息暴乱作出巨大贡献
    新华社北京7月8日电（通讯员潘仕明）解放军总参谋长迟浩田，副总参谋长徐信、徐惠滋，总政治部副主任周克玉，总后勤部副部长张彬等今天上午在武警总部机关礼堂看望和慰问了执行戒严任务的武警部队部分官兵。
    三总部领导赞扬了武警部队在平息反革命暴乱中作出的巨大贡献。迟浩田说，武警部队从制止动乱以来，一直战斗在一线。事实证明，武警部队是一支党中央信得过的武装力量，不愧是威武之师，文明之师。我代表三总部和戒严部队指挥部感谢你们。
    迟浩田指出，现在北京的平息反革命暴乱的斗争虽然取得了决定性的胜利，但我们还应看到，暴乱分子的反革命气焰还很嚣张，我们的任务还很艰巨，需要继续发扬军、警、民相互配合、协同作战的精神，坚决保卫党中央的安全，保卫改革的伟大成果、保卫四化建设的胜利进行。
