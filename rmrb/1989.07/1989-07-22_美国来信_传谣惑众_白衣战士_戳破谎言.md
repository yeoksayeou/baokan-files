Recently, a letter warning certain individuals at the University of Hawaii Medical School not to do things that harm the feelings of the Chinese people was sent across the Pacific. This letter was written by the "white-coat warriors" of the 208th Hospital of the Shenyang Military Region.

In early July, certain individuals at the University of Hawaii Medical School consecutively sent "21st Century Medical Service Discussion Invitations" to the 208th Hospital. The letters contained rumors from a Hong Kong newspaper, such as "massacre at Tiananmen Square, tens of thousands killed and injured," "soldiers bloodthirsty," "tanks charging into crowds and crushing people," all of which were fabrications aimed at distorting the truth about the martial law troops' suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. They also shamelessly stated, "The invitation is a cover to avoid postal inspection. Please distribute the copies of the 'Beijing Massacre' to your relatives and friends."

The Party Committee of the 208th Hospital was acutely aware that the truth about the suppression of the riots in Beijing had been revealed, yet defamatory letters from certain individuals in the United States continued to arrive, indicating their malicious intentions. We must fully recognize the current international climate and resolutely fight against the international reactionary forces led by the United States. They used the "American Letters" as a negative example to educate all personnel in the hospital. To counter the malicious intentions of a small group of reactionaries abroad with facts, the 208th Hospital sent materials related to the truth about the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots and letters refuting the rumors to the University of Hawaii Medical School. They hoped that the truth would be conveyed to the American people and their relatives and friends, and at the same time, warned a small group of reactionaries that spreading rumors that harm the feelings of the two countries' peoples and doing things that harm the interests of the two countries' peoples will have no good outcome.

    “美国来信”传谣惑众
    “白衣战士”戳破谎言
    本报讯　日前，一封正告美国夏威夷大学医学院一些人不要做伤害中国人民感情事情的信件，飞往大洋彼岸。这封信是沈阳军区208医院“白衣战士”写的。
    7月上旬，美国夏威夷大学医学院的某些人接连给208医院寄来所谓“21世纪医疗服务讨论邀请信”。信中夹带着香港某报刊登的所谓“血洗天安门、死伤数万人”、“士兵嗜血成性”、“坦克冲入人群乱碾”等全篇歪曲戒严部队平息北京反革命暴乱真相的谣言。还露骨地声称“邀请是假的，目的是为了逃避邮政检查，请你们把信中的北京大屠杀的复印件广泛传给亲朋好友”。
    208医院党委敏感地意识到，北京平息暴乱的真相已昭示于人，而美国一些人不敢署具姓名的造谣信还接连飞来，说明其用心险恶。我们应当充分认清当前的国际气候，同美国为首的国际反动势力坚决斗争。他们利用“美国来信”这个反面教材，对全院人员进行教育。为了用事实还击国外一小撮反动分子的险恶用意，208医院把有关平息反革命暴乱真相的材料和批驳谣言的书信一同寄给了美国夏威夷大学医学院，希望他们把事实告诉美国人民，传给亲朋好友，同时正告一小撮反动分子，传播伤害两国人民感情的谣言，做有损于两国人民利益的事没有好结果。（李金平　韦东）
