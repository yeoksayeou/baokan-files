People's Daily, Tokyo, July 24th. Reporter Yu Qing reports: The results of Japan's 15th House of Councillors election were fully announced this afternoon: the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) suffered a heavy defeat, losing its majority in the House of Councillors. The Socialist Party doubled its seats, and the opposition parties became the majority.

The House of Councillors has a total of 252 seats, with half of them up for election every three years. In the 126 seats up for election this time, the LDP won only 36 seats. Including the 73 seats not up for election, the LDP fell short of half of the House of Councillors, thus losing its majority position it had held for 34 years. Among the opposition parties, the Socialist Party won 46 seats, the Clean Government Party won 10 seats, the Communist Party won 5 seats, the Democratic Socialist Party won 3 seats, and other parties and groups won 26 seats. This is the first time the opposition parties have held the majority in the House of Councillors.

LDP Secretary-General Hashimoto Ryutaro stated that he would follow the party leader's decision regarding his own position. Socialist Party Chairman Doi Takako said in a speech that the opposition parties would once again demand the early dissolution of the House of Representatives and the holding of a general election. According to the current situation, the LDP does not need to change the government and should hand over the government to the opposition parties.

Public opinion believes that due to the reversal of the number of seats between the LDP and the opposition parties in the House of Councillors, the Diet will face a more complex situation in the future.

    日本参院选举揭晓
    自民党惨败　在野党成为多数派
    本报东京7月24日电　记者于青报道：日本第15次参院选举今天下午全部揭晓：自民党惨败，在参院失去占多数的议席。社会党议席倍增，在野党在参院成为多数派。
    日本参院共有252议席，每3年改选半数。在改选的126议席中，自民党仅获36议席，加上未改选的73议席，不足参院的半数，由此失去了在参院34年一直居多数的地位。在野党中，社会党获46议席，公明党获10议席，共产党获5议席，民社党获3议席，其他政党和团体获26议席，在野党首次在参院占有多数议席。
    自民党干事长桥本龙太郎表示，自己是否留任将听从党首的决定。社会党委员长土井多贺子发表讲话说，在野党将再次要求尽早解散众院，举行大选。根据目前的事态，自民党不需更迭政权，应该把政权交给在野党。
    舆论认为，由于自民党与在野党在参院的议席数逆转，今后国会将面临更复杂的局面。
