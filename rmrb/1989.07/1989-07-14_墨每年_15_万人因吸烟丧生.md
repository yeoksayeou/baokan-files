	Mexico's Planning and Budget Department released statistics on July 9 indicating that in 1989, Mexican smokers will consume nearly 3.4 billion packs of cigarettes.

	The statistics show that the increase in cigarette sales reflects an increase in the number of smokers. Currently, there are 20 million smokers in Mexico, including many women and children.

	According to statistics, one person dies every 13 seconds worldwide due to smoking. In Mexico, 150,000 people die each year from smoking-related causes. To raise awareness about the dangers of smoking, Mexico has designated July 10 as National No-Smoking Day.
