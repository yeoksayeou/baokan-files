Strengthen Policy Propaganda

In recent years, what have peasant brothers yearned for the most? From a large number of readers' letters, it is evident that they yearn to understand the Party's policies, to stabilize the Party's policies, and to see the Party's policies implemented.

Why are peasants so concerned about policies? Because it directly affects their personal interests. Rural work cannot do without the Party's policy guidance. Take production as an example: from the planting plans for crops, the procurement of production materials, to the delivery of agricultural and sideline products, every step is closely related to the Party's policies. Therefore, as long as we timely propagate and explain the Party's policies, making them penetrate into every household and be implemented in actual work, agricultural production will develop.

However, for a period of time, many regions have neglected necessary policy propaganda and situation education. Some places even go a year or two without holding a single meeting, making it impossible to timely and accurately convey the Party's policies. Another situation is that the Party's policies are conveyed, but not seriously implemented, resulting in blind directives, making it impossible for the Party's policies to be fulfilled. Coupled with some mistakes and shortcomings in the work of the Party and the government, this has caused doubts and panic among the masses. As a result, rumors and various falsehoods have taken advantage of the situation, adding to the confusion among the people. Thus, destructive production activities such as slaughtering pigs and sheep, cutting down trees and destroying forests, and illegally occupying arable land have emerged, seriously dampening the enthusiasm of the peasants, affecting social stability, and interfering with the implementation of the Party's reform and opening-up policies.

The tide of reform has indeed brought hope to our beautiful countryside and benefits to the hardworking and wise peasants. The broad masses of peasants truly understand and wholeheartedly support the Party's policies. To make rural work vibrant, we must strengthen policy propaganda and situation education in rural areas. Rural Party organizations and government agencies must take this as their responsibility and do it well. When the Party's policies are deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, those rumors and various falsehoods will have no market, and the people's minds will be at ease. Naturally, the enthusiasm for production will also be high.

### 抓好政策宣传

    抓好政策宣传
    这些年来，农民弟兄都渴望些什么？从大量读者来信看，比较多的是渴望了解党的政策，渴望稳定党的政策，渴望兑现党的政策。
    为什么农民对政策如此关心呢？因为这直接关系到他们的切身利益。农村工作离不开党的政策指导。且以生产为例，从农作物的种植计划、生产资料的购置，到农副产品的交售等每一个环节，都与党的政策密不可分。所以，只要我们及时宣传解释，使党的政策深入农户，并在实际工作中得到贯彻，农业生产就会得到发展。
    但是，一个时期以来，不少地区忽视了必要的政策宣传和形势教育，有的甚至一两年之内也难得开一次会，这就不可能及时准确地传达党的政策。另有一种情况是，党的政策也传达了，但又不认真执行，搞瞎指挥，使党的政策不能兑现。加之党和政府工作出现某些失误和不足，造成了群众心理上的疑虑和恐慌。这样一来，小道消息、各种谣言乘虚而入，给群众增加思想混乱。于是乎，类似杀猪宰羊、砍树毁林、滥占耕地等破坏性的生产就出现了，严重地挫伤了农民的积极性，影响了社会的安定，干扰了党的改革开放方针政策的执行。
    改革大潮确实给我们美丽的田野带来了希望，给勤劳智慧的农民带来了实惠。广大农民对党的政策是真正理解和衷心拥护的。我们要把农村工作搞得生机勃勃，就必须加强农村的政策宣传和形势教育。农村的党组织和政权机构要把这件事作为份内工作切实抓起来。党的政策深入人心，那些小道消息和各种谣言也就没有市场了，群众的心也就踏实了。自然，搞生产的积极性也就高了。
