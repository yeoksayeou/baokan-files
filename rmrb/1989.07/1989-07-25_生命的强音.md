    The Strong Beat of Life
    Lü Zǔpǐn

    Romain Rolland said, "Music is flowing architecture." This year marks the 50th anniversary of composer Zhang Wénjiān's musical career. He has composed hundreds of songs, some profound and solid like steel, others delicate like fragrant camphor wood. In short, they are indispensable elements of modern Chinese music.

    In 1953, he co-wrote "On the Peaceful Land of the Motherland" with Li Qún. The melody is robust and beautiful, like a deep carving, full of vigor. At that time, we were studying in a regional cadre class, and the students from the Qin-Lian region of Guangxi always gathered to sing this song. Everyone was proud that our hometown had produced such a composer and such outstanding works.

    Rolland's metaphor about music is naturally non-utilitarian. Facing the enemy, since stones can be used as weapons, music should become daggers and spears. Zhang Wénjiān's choral works from the 1940s, such as "Lovers of Freedom" and "The Brave Rider Goes to Battle," and the sonata "We Stand Up" belong to this category. After liberation, he worked successively at the Central Conservatory of Music, the Central Song and Dance Ensemble, and the Central Orchestra. His passion and talent were fully expressed, and many of his songs won awards in international and domestic competitions.

    The first time I met Zhang Wénjiān, he looked melancholic, spoke softly, as if afraid to disturb something and cause trouble. No wonder, at that time he was laboring in the May Seventh Cadre School in Xiaotangshan, Beijing, wearing a heavy hat labeled "Nationalist spy" for his progressive musical activities in Chongqing and Shanghai in the 1940s, a baseless accusation by the rebels.

    After returning from the cadre school, he and an old friend brought a bag of crabs to a friend's gathering. The courtyard house was filled with a warm sense of hometown, but the summer chill was still piercing.

    When the composer was disheartened after being criticized and struggled against, one day he went to the Temple of Earth Park. By chance, he saw a young girl leaning against a flower trellis, softly singing a song: "Beautiful fields, green rivers..." Zhang Wénjiān's heart trembled slightly, moved that the songs he had poured his heart into had not become a cry in the wilderness.

    This was like giving him a bouquet of fresh flowers...

    These days, real flowers have finally been delivered to his hands—Central Orchestra, Chinese Musicians' Association Composition Committee, and three other units held a choral concert to celebrate Zhang Wénjiān's 50th anniversary of composition.

    People followed the songs to recall the path he had taken. This path was rugged, with ups and downs. Every time the dawn broke, his forever young heart would surge with the passion of ideals.

    Over the decades, Zhang Wénjiān has created a large number of children's songs. "We Sing Happily," "Our Fields," and "Goodbye, Ocean" are undoubtedly among the best children's songs since the founding of the nation, making listeners reluctant to leave and unforgettable. In the new era, he has created and adapted many choral and solo songs, still maintaining a strong creative force. Although he has retired, he is now also the editor-in-chief of "Children's Music" by the Chinese Musicians' Association, continuing to contribute to the development of children's music in our country.

    This reminds me of the wood-oil tree in my hometown, a beautiful tree with a strong life force: plant it anywhere, and it will call for spring there.

    生命的强音
    卢祖品
    罗曼·罗兰说，音乐是流动的建筑。今年是作曲家张文纲从事音乐创作50周年，他共创作了几百首歌曲，有的深厚凝重如钢铁，有的秀丽如微香四溢的樟木，总之都是近代中国乐坛不可或缺的建筑或构件。
    1953年，他与李群合写了《在祖国和平的土地上》，曲调雄健优美，仿佛具有深度的雕刻，奋张着力。那时我们在地区学干班学习，广西钦廉四属的同学，集合时总离不开这一曲。大家很为故乡出了这样一位作曲家和作曲家如此出色的作品而感到骄傲。
    罗曼·罗兰关于音乐的譬喻自然是超功利性的。面对敌人，既然石头都能作为武器，音乐更应成为匕首和投枪。张文纲40年代创作的合唱《爱好自由的人们》、《壮士骑马打仗去了》和奏鸣曲《我们站起来了》等等当属这一类。解放以后，他先后在中央音乐学院、中央歌舞团和中央乐团工作，他的热情和才能得到了充分的表现，创作的歌曲，好些在国际、国内比赛中获奖。
    我第一次见张文纲时，他神情忧郁，说话小声小气，生怕惊动了什么引起不测。也难怪，那时他正在京郊小汤山五·七干校劳动改造，头上顶着重得可怕的帽子——无非是40年代在重庆、上海从事进步音乐活动那段经历，被造反派课以“国民党特务”之类莫须有的罪名。
    从干校回来，他同一位老乡拎着一袋螃蟹到朋友家聚会。四合院平房洋溢着的乡情叫人觉得亲切，但仲夏时节仍寒意逼人。
    作曲家迭受批斗心灰意冷的时候，有一天，他来到地坛公园，无意中看见一个少女，背靠花架栏杆，轻轻唱着一支歌：“美丽的田野，碧绿的河水……”
    张文纲的心轻轻颤慄了，感动于当日讴心沥血的歌吟没有成为旷野的呼喊。
    这无异于给他送上一束鲜花……
    这几天，真的鲜花终于送到了他的手上——中央乐团、中国音协创作委员会等三个单位为张文纲作曲50周年举办他的合唱作品音乐会。
    人们循着歌声回顾他走过的路。这路是崎岖的，跌宕在波峰浪谷之间。每当晨曦初透，他那永远年轻的心开始沸扬着理想的激情。
    几十年来，张文纲创作了大量儿童歌曲。《我们快乐地歌唱》、《我们的田野》和《再见，大海》等，毫无疑问可以列入建国以来优秀儿童歌曲的序列，令听众流连不忍轻去，无法忘怀。新时期以来，他创作、改编了许多合唱和独唱歌曲，依然保持着旺盛的创造力。他虽已离休，现在仍兼任中国音协《儿童音乐》的主编，为发展我国儿童音乐事业继续贡献力量。
    我由此想起故乡的木麻黄，一种秀美的乔木，生命力忒强：插到哪里，就在哪里呼唤春天。
