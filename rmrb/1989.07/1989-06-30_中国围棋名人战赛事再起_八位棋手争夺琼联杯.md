The Chinese Weiqi King of Kings Tournament, co-hosted by the People's Daily Overseas Edition and the Chinese Weiqi Association, is one of the highest-level Weiqi invitation tournaments in the country. The current elite of the Chinese Weiqi world are all participating in the competition. Among them are "Go Saint" Plie Wei-ping, who made significant contributions in the three China-Japan Weiqi Tsumego matches, and renowned players such as Ma Xiao-chun, Liu Xiao-guang, and Qian Yu-ping, who are all currently the top six dan players in China. The second tournament began in February this year in Beijing, with the first stage consisting of five elimination rounds.

The second stage will use a round-robin format, and the final winner will earn the right to challenge the previous year's "King of Kings," Liu Xiao-guang, 9th dan, in a best-of-five match to determine the champion of this year's tournament.

The player who wins the second Chinese "King of Kings" title will compete against the Japanese "King of Kings" in a China-Japan Weiqi King of Kings match in Beijing at the end of this year.

This tournament in Hainan Province has received support and assistance from the China Hainan Qionglian Trade (Group) Company and the Hainan Sike Limited Company.
