Energy Department Emphasizes Full Completion of This Year's National Plan

    Energy production in China saw overall growth in the first half of the year. A responsible official from the Energy Department revealed to reporters today that China's coal production is on track to reach the goal of 1 billion tons this year. By the end of June, the national coal production totaled 479 million tons, accounting for 48.6% of the annual plan, an increase of over 38 million tons compared to the same period last year.

    According to the report, China's energy production has been on a steady increase this year. Coal production has been rising steadily, reaching a daily production level of 2.9 million tons in June, the highest in history. The average daily production for the first half of the year was 2.65 million tons. Energy Department officials believe that maintaining this level will ensure the completion of the 985 million tons annual national plan.

    Electricity production in the first half of the year totaled 276.8 billion kilowatt-hours, completing 48.57% of the annual plan, an increase of 13.8 billion kilowatt-hours compared to the same period last year. Of this, hydroelectric power generation reached 53.43 billion kilowatt-hours, completing 51.87% of the annual plan. Due to severe shortages of coal reserves and water storage in power plants and reservoirs in the latter half of last year, electricity production faced difficulties at the beginning of this year. The first quarter's electricity production was only on par with the same period last year. After multiple coordination efforts by relevant departments of the State Council to increase coal supply, electricity production showed a growth trend in the second quarter.

    The first half of the year saw crude oil production reaching 67.538 million tons, completing 48.59% of the annual plan, an increase of 4.2 million tons compared to last year. However, the target of increasing production by 300 million tons is still far from being achieved. Particularly, the Shengli Oilfield, which had the most potential for increased production this year, faced significant production shortfalls due to natural disasters such as floods and hailstorms.

    Natural gas production in the first half of the year reached 7.04 billion cubic meters, exactly half of the annual plan.

    The Energy Department recently held a national energy production conference, assigning tasks for the second half of the year. It is required that the energy industry fully completes this year's national plan, with coal production reaching or exceeding 1 billion tons, electricity production reaching 57 billion kilowatt-hours, and crude oil production striving to complete 139 million tons.

### 上半年能源生产全面增长  能源部强调全面完成今年国家计划

    上半年能源生产全面增长
    能源部强调全面完成今年国家计划
    新华社北京7月3日电（记者赵明亮）能源部有关负责人今天向记者透露，今年我国原煤生产达到10亿吨目标很有希望。截至6月底，全国原煤产量共完成4.79亿吨，占年计划的48.6％，比去年同期净增3800多万吨。
    据介绍，今年上半年我国能源生产全面增长。原煤生产一直呈递增趋势，至6月份日产水平达290万吨，创历史最高记录。上半年的平均日产水平达265万吨，能源部人士认为，保持这个水平即可完成9.85亿吨的全年国家计划。
    电力生产上半年共发电2768亿度，完成全年计划的48.57％，比去年同期增发138亿度。其中水电发电量达534.3亿度，已完成年计划的51.87％。由于去年下半年电厂存煤及水库储水均严重不足，今年年初电力生产曾遇到了困难，一季度发电量只与去年同期持平。经过国务院有关部门多次协调，增供电煤，进入二季度后电力生产出现增长势头。
    上半年原油产量完成6753.8万吨，完成全年计划的48.59％，比去年增产了42万吨，但离原确定的超产300万吨的目标距离尚远。尤其是今年最有希望增产的胜利油田，因遇到洪水、冰雹等自然灾害，上半年欠产较多。
    天然气生产上半年完成70.4亿立方米，刚好达到全年计划的一半。
    能源部日前召开全国能源生产会议，布置了下半年生产任务，要求能源行业要全面完成今年国家计划，原煤产量要达到或超过10亿吨，发电量达到5700亿度，原油产量要千方百计完成1.39亿吨。
