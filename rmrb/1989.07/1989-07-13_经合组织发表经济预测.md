The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) released a report titled "OECD Economic Outlook" on June 29, stating that curbing inflation, stabilizing interest rates, and strengthening the multilateral trading system are the primary tasks facing industrialized countries in the coming years.

The report notes that the OECD's average economic growth rate has been on the rise in recent years, while the unemployment rate has been declining. The growth rate in 1988 exceeded 4%, and the unemployment rate dropped to 7%. The report forecasts that the economic growth rate for the current and next year will be 3.25% and 2.25%, respectively, with the unemployment rate remaining around 7% and 7.25%.

According to the forecast, the average inflation rate for OECD member countries will reach 4.5% over the next two years. The U.S. is expected to see an inflation rate of 5% this year and 5.25% next year.

The report also points out that over the past two years, currency exchange rates have been relatively stable. However, with the recent rise in the U.S. dollar, the foreign exchange market has become volatile. Governments should use all means to coordinate efforts and keep the risk of currency fluctuations to a minimum.

The report emphasizes that another key task for the OECD is to strengthen the multilateral trading system under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and to fully utilize the opportunities provided by the Uruguay Round of negotiations.

    经合组织发表经济预测
    经济合作与发展组织于6月29日发表的一份题为《经合组织经济前景》的报告认为，制止通货膨胀、稳定利率和加强多边贸易体系是各工业国家在今后几年中面临的主要任务。
    报告指出，经合组织的经济平均增长率近年来持续提高，失业率呈下降的趋势。1988年的增长率超过了4％，而失业率则降到7％。报告预测，今明两年的经济增长率将分别为3.25％和2.25％，失业率可维持在7％和7.25％左右。
    据预测，经合组织成员国的平均通货膨胀率今明两年将达到4.5％，其中美国今年可达5％，明年将进而升至5.25％。
    报告还指出，最近两年多以来，各国货币的汇率呈现了较为稳定的局面，但是近一个时期以来，随着美元汇价的上升，外汇市场出现了动荡。各国政府应该使用一切手段加强协调，使汇率失控的危险保持在最低的程度上。
    报告认为，经合组织的另一项中心工作是加强在关税及贸易总协定管理下的多边贸易体系，充分利用乌拉圭回合谈判所提供的一切机会。
