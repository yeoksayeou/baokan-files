Chen Zuode told me that to achieve the goal of promoting weiqi from China to the world, the Chinese Weiqi Association has some specific plans. First, the association aims to become a substantive organization. The State Sports Commission plans to start with 5-6 projects to experiment with this. Currently, the football association and the wushu association have taken the lead, and soon, the weiqi, boxing, and motorcycle associations will also become substantive organizations. By substantive organizations, it means having relatively independent personnel and financial powers. There are many advantages to this approach. For example, the Chinese Weiqi Association can then establish a membership system, with both group and individual members. On one hand, membership fees can be used to support the development of weiqi, and on the other hand, it can facilitate exchanges among members. Additionally, in areas such as international exchanges, organizing activities, and training players, there will be fewer constraints, allowing the weiqi industry to develop more vigorously.

Finally, Chen Zuode shared his views on the current state of young weiqi players. Chen Zuode said that currently, players like Liu Xiaoguang, Ma Xiaochun, Qian Yeping, and Yu Bin are all very talented. They have good competition results, but compared to Nie Weiping, they lack the ability to hold their ground in crucial moments. Mr. Hideyuki, who highly appreciates Ma Xiaochun, has won several championships from Nie Weiping in various domestic competitions over the past few years. Other players have also had examples of defeating Nie Weiping, but when they face major competitions like the China-Japan Weiqi Match, they appear immature, lack confidence, and even lose in advantageous situations. Chen Zuode emphasized that a young player should have great aspirations and determination. Only then will they have the confidence and perseverance to produce a second, third, and even more Nie Weipings.

    从中国走向世界
    ——访中国围棋协会主席陈祖德
    （二）
    陈祖德告诉我，为了实现围棋从中国走向世界这一目标，中国围棋协会也有一些具体设想。首先一点，把围棋协会办成一个实体性的机构。国家体委准备从5、6个项目的协会开始进行尝试。目前已有足球协会、武术协会先行了一步，接下来，围棋、拳击、摩托车等协会也将变为实体性组织。所谓实体性组织，就是有相对独立的人权、财权。这样办的好处很多，例如中国围棋协会以后可搞会员制，可以有团体会员，也可以有个人会员，一方面通过收会费用于围棋的发展，另外也可开展会员间的交流。此外，在对外交流、组织活动、培养棋手等方面可以减少许多束缚，使围棋事业能更蓬蓬勃勃地发展起来。
    最后，陈祖德就中国年轻棋手的现状谈了些看法。陈祖德说，目前像刘小光、马晓春、钱宇平、俞斌等一些年轻棋手，都是十分有才华的。他们比赛成绩都不错，但比起聂卫平来，最欠缺的恐怕就是关键时刻顶不住。秀行先生十分欣赏的马晓春，好几年前就在各种国内比赛中从聂卫平手里把一个个冠军夺了过来。其他一些棋手，也有战胜聂卫平的例子，但是当他们面对中日擂台赛这样一些重大比赛时，就显得稚嫩，缺少自信心，甚至在优势的情况下输掉了。陈祖德强调，一个年轻棋手，应有大抱负、大志气，这样才会有信心，有毅力，才会有第二个、第三个以至于更多的聂卫平出现。本报记者　陈昭（本文完）
