	Monumental Columns (and another poem)
	Chen Guangbin

	As a symbol,
	Standing in a sacred position,
	Pure white like jade,
	Yet a badge on the chest of the republic,
	Thunder has not shaken it,
	Wind has not shaken it,
	Summer rain has not washed it away,
	Winter snow has not bowed it.
	Weathered by wind and rain,
	Adding more elegance and grace,
	Through the cycles of time,
	Witnessing the rise and fall of countless scenes,
	Broken spears sunk in the sand,
	Guns silent, smoke dispersed,
	Still standing unyielding there,
	Supporting the pride of the entire nation,
	Saluting the future century,
	Head held high, chest out,
	Ready at any moment to face the storm,
	After the sudden rain,
	The summer thunderstorm,
	From the heavy clouds it pours down,
	Thunder mixed with flashes of lightning,
	Coming suddenly,
	Leaving suddenly,
	Wind comes, rain goes,
	Washing the mountains and rivers bluer and greener,
	Flowers still bloom,
	Grass still grows,
	The river water still clear,
	White clouds still leisurely,
	The red plums on the branches even sweeter,
	The cuckoo's song even more melodious,
	After the sudden rain,
	The morning breeze kisses a few more blossoms,
	See the rainbow in the sky,
	Colors vivid,
	Adding more charm to the majestic mountains and rivers.

    华表（外一首）
    陈广斌
    作为象征
    站立在神圣的位置上
    洁白似玉
    可是共和国胸前的一枚符号
    雷未曾动摇
    风未曾动摇
    夏雨未曾冲跨
    冬雪未曾压倒
    栉风沐雨
    更平添几分潇洒风貌
    沧桑循回
    曾目睹几番苍烟落照
    折戟沉沙
    枪冷烟消
    依然不屈地站在那里
    支撑着整个民族的骄傲
    向未来世纪行注目礼
    昂首挺胸
    随时都准备迎击风暴
    骤雨初晴
    夏天的雷阵雨
    从沉郁的云层洒落
    雷声夹杂着几道闪电
    来得猝然
    去得猝然
    风来雨去
    把山岳河海洗得更绿更蓝
    花依然
    草依然
    河水依然清澈
    白云依然悠闲
    枝头的红杏更加甜美
    布谷鸟的歌声更加委婉
    骤雨初晴
    晨风又吻红几树花瓣
    看那天边的夏虹
    七彩分明
    更与巍巍江山添几分娇艳
