The Chinese men's volleyball team last night in Rotenburg faced the West German volleyball team for the second time and won 3-1. On July 24, the two teams met for the first time in Velden, Lower Saxony, where the home team won convincingly with a 3-0 score. The set scores were 15-13, 15-6, and 15-2. In the first set, the home team had difficulty adapting to the Chinese team's style, falling behind early, but then tied the score at 8-8 and began to lead. The three sets were completed in 1 hour and 13 minutes.

The West German men's volleyball team has recently shown improved strength, recently winning in the European Volleyball Championship qualifiers with a 3-0 score against Israel, Spain, and Hungary, and a 3-2 victory against the Netherlands, securing the first place in their group. After eight years of inactivity, they have once again qualified to participate in the European Championships.

    中国男排访问西德
    新华社波恩7月27日电　中国国家男子排球队昨晚在罗滕堡与联邦德国排球队第二次交锋，以3∶1获胜。24日，两队在下萨克森州的弗尔登首次相遇，主队以3∶0的明显优势获胜，3局比分是15∶13、15∶6和15∶2。第一局比赛开始时，主队难以适应中国队打法，比分落后，后来追到8平并开始领先。3局比赛仅用了1小时13分。
    西德男排近来实力上升，最近在欧洲排球锦标赛预赛中，以3∶0的同样比分先后战胜以色列队、西班牙队和匈牙利队，并以3∶2战胜荷兰队，获得小组第1名。在八年沉寂后，又一次取得参加欧洲锦标赛的资格。
