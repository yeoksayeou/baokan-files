In Latin America, after Bush took office in the White House, he faced several thorny issues left by the Reagan administration, such as Central America, Panama, massive foreign debt, trade, democratization, and drug trafficking. These issues pose a significant threat to U.S. interests in Latin America. As Latin American countries' dissatisfaction and expectations towards the U.S. continue to grow, people are increasingly focused on what new policies the Bush administration will adopt towards Central America.

The Central American issue is currently one of the world's hotspots. During Reagan's eight-year term, he aimed to contain Soviet expansion in Central America by first focusing on preventing El Salvador from becoming a "second Nicaragua." Later, due to the root of El Salvador's problems lying in the Nicaraguan government's support for Salvadoran guerrillas, Reagan shifted his primary target to Nicaragua. Thus, U.S.-Nicaraguan relations became the focal point of the Central American issue. After eight years of struggle, the Nicaraguan Sandinista government still exists, and the stalemate between the conflicting parties in El Salvador remains unchanged. For the U.S., the Central American issue has come full circle, meaning the Bush administration still faces a Nicaraguan Sandinista government and an El Salvador mired in civil war.

Analysts believe that the Bush administration has two options in dealing with Nicaragua: either use the military intervention method that Reagan did not adopt, or change Reagan's policy and formulate a new one. Judging from the development trend, the Bush administration is likely to choose the latter. The reasons are as follows: First, in the latter part of the Reagan administration, with the Democrats holding the majority in Congress, the military aid bill for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels had difficulty passing. Now, with the Democrats' strength in Congress further increasing, continued military aid to the Contras is even more difficult to obtain congressional approval. Second, internal divisions within the Contras have intensified, and their combat effectiveness and morale are deteriorating. Some Contras have even engaged in talks with the government. Third, Latin American countries, including the U.S.'s allies in Central America, are dissatisfied with Reagan's rigid Central American policy, putting significant pressure on the U.S. Fourth, the five Central American heads of state reached a new agreement on the Central American issue. If the U.S. continues to aid the Contras and provoke new conflicts, it will be seen as a violation of the "agreement." Fifth, in the context of improving U.S.-Soviet relations, both the U.S. and the Soviet Union are inclined to compromise on the Central American issue. Sixth, Nicaragua faces severe domestic difficulties and a grim economic situation, and Nicaragua also hopes to reconcile with the U.S. as soon as possible. In summary, the changing situation provides the Bush administration with the opportunity and possibility to change its Central American policy. After taking office, Bush began reviewing the entire U.S. foreign policy and plans to formulate new policies based on this review. It is still difficult to say how much the Bush administration's Central American policy will change. It has indicated that it will focus on diplomatic means to resolve the Central American issue in the future, which is already a significant change.

For the U.S., even if the Nicaraguan issue is resolved, the Central American issue will not be over. This is because the situation in El Salvador, to some extent, is even more worrying for the U.S. The ARENA party government of Duarte, which has received over $3 billion in U.S. aid over the years, has managed to hold on, but the stalemate between the government and the leftist guerrillas has not been broken for years. Additionally, the far-right National Republican Alliance won the elections this year. The rise of the far-right could mean further escalation of internal conflicts in El Salvador. Therefore, it is possible that at some point, the U.S.'s focus on Central American policy will shift from Nicaragua back to El Salvador. It seems that in El Salvador, in addition to preventing the leftist guerrillas from seizing power by force, the Bush administration also faces the challenge of promoting the new right-wing government to implement "democratization," making the policy more difficult.

There are signs that cooperating with the Socialist International and Christian Democratic parties to some extent may become part of the Bush administration's Central American policy. These two parties have significant influence in Latin America. The Bush administration has a basis for cooperation with them. They share a common interest with the U.S. in stabilizing the situation in Central America and preventing Soviet exploitation. In recent years, through the Contadora Group's activities and the efforts of Costa Rican President Arias, the influence of the Socialist International and Christian Democratic parties in Central America has been growing, and they have received support and recognition from many Latin American countries, Western Europe, and other regions. Their role as a buffer and mediator in the Central American conflict is irreplaceable. Additionally, on the Central American issue, the basic stance of the above two parties is quite close to that of the Democrats, who hold the majority in the U.S. Congress. Considering that the Bush administration emphasizes maintaining a cooperative relationship with the Democrats, this will also prompt the Bush administration to adopt a policy of cooperating with these two parties to some extent, making the Bush administration's policy towards Central America more moderate.

    中美洲问题：美国的疑难杂症
    晓渔
    在拉美地区，布什入主白宫后面临着里根政府留下的一些疑难杂症，诸如中美洲、巴拿马、巨额外债、贸易、民主化和毒品走私等问题。这些问题对美在拉美的利益构成了很大的威胁。由于拉美国家对美的不满和期望与日剧增，人们越发注视布什政府会对中美洲采取什么新的政策。
    中美洲问题目前是世界热点地区之一。里根任期8年中，他为遏制苏联在中美洲的扩张，先是把防止萨尔瓦多变为“第二个尼加拉瓜”作为重点，后来由于萨的问题根源在于尼加拉瓜政府支持了萨游击队，里根乃把主要打击目标转向了尼加拉瓜，因此美尼关系也就成为中美洲问题的焦点。经过8年的较量，尼“桑阵”政府依然存在，萨国内冲突双方僵持的总格局仍未改变，中美洲问题对美来说等于转了一个圈又回到原来的位置，也就是说，布什政府目前仍需面对一个尼“桑阵”政府和一个内战未断的萨尔瓦多。
    分析家认为，布什政府在对付尼加拉瓜上，要么使用里根未曾采用的出兵干涉的办法，要么改变里根的政策，重新制定新的政策。从事态发展趋势来看，布什政府将采取后一种的选择。因为：一、里根政府后期，在国会中民主党占优势的情况下，对尼加拉瓜反政府武装（简称“尼反”）的军援议案已难通过。现在民主党在国会中势力进一步增长，对“尼反”继续军援更难取得国会同意。二、“尼反”内部分裂加剧，战斗力和士气每况愈下，一部分“尼反”还与政府进行了谈判。三、拉美国家包括美在中美洲的“盟友”对里根僵化的中美洲政策不满，对美压力很大。四、中美洲五国首脑会议就中美洲问题达成了新协议，如美继续援助“尼反”挑起新的冲突将被视为对“协议”的破坏。五、在美、苏总的关系趋于缓和的情况下，美、苏都倾向于在中美洲问题上进行妥协。六、尼国内困难重重，经济形势极为严峻，尼也希望尽早与美国和解。总之，形势的变化为布什政府提供了改变中美洲政策的机会与可能。布什上台后即开始对美国整个对外政策进行了回顾，拟在回顾的基础上制定新的政策。布什政府的中美洲政策究竟会有多大变化现在尚很难说。它表示今后将着重以外交手段解决中美洲问题，应该说这已是一个不小的变化。
    对美来说，即使尼加拉瓜问题得以解决，中美洲问题也不能就此结束。因为，萨尔瓦多局势从某种程度上来说更令美忧虑。几年中受美援助达30多亿美元的基民党杜阿尔特政府虽说保持下来，但政府与左派游击队几年来的僵持不下的局面始终未能突破。另外，极右派民族主义共和联盟在今年大选中一举获胜。极右派上台可能意味着萨国内斗争进一步激化。所以，不能排除某个时期，美对中美洲政策的重点将从尼加拉瓜又转向萨尔瓦多。看来，在萨尔瓦多，除防止左派游击队武力夺权外，布什政府还面临着如何促使新的右派政权推行“民主化”的问题，政策难度将会更大。
    有迹象表明，同拉美社民党和基民党进行一定的合作可能成为布什政府中美洲政策的组成部分。这两个党在拉美地区有很大影响。布什政府与其合作具有一定的基础。它们在稳定中美洲局势，防止苏联利用方面与美国有共同利益。最近几年，通过孔塔多拉集团活动和哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯的努力，社民党和基民党在中美洲地区的作用与日剧增，且得到广大拉美国家和西欧以及其他地区的支持和肯定。它们在中美洲冲突各方中所起的缓冲、调解的作用是无法被代替的。另外，在中美洲问题上，上述两党的基本立场与美国会中占优势的民主党十分相近。考虑到布什政府强调要同民主党保持合作的关系，这也会促使布什政府采取同这两个党进行某种合作的政策，从而使布什政府对中美洲的政策带上一定的温和色彩。
