Newsprint, once a major concern for China's publishing industry in 1988. How to solve the "newsprint shortage"? Recently, the authors interviewed Wu Xiuhe, the director of Nanping Paper Mill.

Fujian Nanping Paper Mill is currently the largest newsprint producer in China. When it was built and put into operation in 1958, it had a production capacity of 34,000 tons. After several expansions and renovations, its output has tripled over 30 years. Last year, its output accounted for 1/4 of the national total. Wu Xiuhe said that the per capita paper consumption of a country is an indicator of its national cultural quality. China's current annual per capita paper consumption is 8 kilograms, which is not high in the world. China's annual demand for newsprint is about 750,000 tons, but last year only 380,000 tons were actually produced, creating a large supply-demand gap and resulting in a "newsprint shortage."

Wu Xiuhe took office as the director in 1983. At that time, there was no paper shortage in society, and there were even inventory backlogs. Some companies switched to producing paper bags with lower costs and higher profits. Wu Xiuhe, however, had a long-term vision and made different choices. Taking advantage of the temporary oversupply, he began to renovate old machinery in 1985 to expand production capacity and improve product quality. He foresaw that with the development of the national economy and cultural undertakings, paper consumption would significantly increase. As a result, he spent only 17 million yuan to successfully renovate two old paper machines, making them the fastest, highest-yielding, and best-quality machines among the nine similar machines in the country. The annual output can be increased by 20,000 tons. Moreover, it can produce "Xingguang" brand newsprint suitable for imported web offset printing machines, with a printing speed of over 120,000 sheets per hour, filling a gap in China's offset newsprint production. Last year, Nanping Mill's "Xingguang" brand newsprint won the Light Industry Department's quality product award.

Insufficient raw materials have brought great difficulties to paper mills. Last year, many paper mills across the country were forced to shut down or operate at half capacity due to insufficient raw material supply, which was the main reason for the worsening "paper shortage." Nanping Mill took the initiative to solve the problem. Starting in 1982, it changed the practice of using large-diameter logs for newsprint production and adopted inferior materials and branch materials for papermaking, solving the problem of raw material shortages and reducing production costs. In the past, large quantities of branch materials that were burned by farmers found an important use, and farmers were also happy. Nanping Mill's approach was adopted by many paper mills. Since 1962, Nanping Mill has begun to establish forestry bases to fundamentally solve the raw material problem. In recent years, Nanping Mill has cooperated with local governments to develop more than 200,000 mu of paper-making forests. Last year, with the approval of the State Planning Commission, it further expanded its scale and started to build a 1.2 million mu specialized paper-making forest base.

To change the situation of tight newsprint supply, Wu Xiuhe and his team are preparing to jointly build a "two-end-out" paper mill with the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po in Fuzhou's Mawei, using imported waste paper as raw materials, which can produce 150,000 tons of pulp paper annually. If successful, it will be put into production in 18 months. In this way, in the near future, Nanping Mill's total production capacity can reach 300,000 tons.

Wu Xiuhe also told the authors that this year, Nanping Mill has changed its supply method. They proactively understand the paper shortages of major newspapers and user units, establish supply and demand contracts, and no longer need to rely on third parties, reducing intermediate links and avoiding "speculators" from interfering.

    如何解决新闻纸荒？
    ——记南平造纸厂厂长吴修和的谈话
    张连兴　林金荣
    新闻纸，曾经困扰着1988年的我国新闻出版界。如何解决“新闻纸荒”？前不久，笔者访问了南平造纸厂厂长吴修和。
    福建南平造纸厂是我国目前最大的新闻纸生产厂家。1958年建成投产时，有3.4万吨生产能力。几经扩建和改造，产量在30年中翻了三番。去年产量占全国总产量的1／4，吴修和说，一个国家的人均用纸量，是衡量国民文化素质的一项标志。我国现在年人均用纸量8公斤，在世界上不算高。我国新闻纸年需求量约为75万吨，而去年实际只生产38万吨，供需缺口太大，形成了“新闻纸荒”。
    吴修和是1983年就任厂长的。当时，社会上并无纸荒，且有库存积压，有的厂家改产成本低利润高的纸袋纸。吴修和则眼光放远，另有抉择，借暂时供过于求之机，从1985年开始，对旧机器进行技术改造，扩大生产能力，提高产品质量。他预见到，随着国民经济和文化事业的发展，用纸量会大大增加。结果只花了1700多万元，成功地改造了两台旧纸机，成为全国现有9台同型纸机中车速最快、产量最高、质量最好的机器，年产量可增加2万吨。而且，可以生产适合进口轮转胶印机用的“星光牌”新闻纸，每小时印数可达12万张以上，填补了我国胶印新闻纸生产的一项空白。去年，南平厂的“星光牌”新闻纸获轻工业部优质产品奖。
    原料不足，给造纸厂家带来很大困难。去年，全国不少造纸厂家因原料供应不足而处于停产或半停产状态，这是加剧“纸荒”的主要原因。南平厂自谋生路，从1982年起，改变新闻纸生产必须用成型大口径原木的做法，采用等外材、枝丫材切片为造纸原料，既解决了原材料不足的矛盾，又降低了生产成本。过去被农民烧掉的大批枝丫材料有了重要的用途，农民也很高兴，南平厂的做法被许多造纸厂采用。自1962年起，南平厂开始创办林业基地，从根本上解决原材料问题。近年来，南平厂与当地政府合作，发展了20多万亩造纸林。去年经国家计委批准，再次扩大规模，着手建设120万亩的造纸专用林基地。
    为了改变新闻纸供应紧张的状况，吴修和他们正准备与香港文汇报合资，在福州马尾兴建一个“两头在外”的纸厂，以进口废纸为原材料，可年产浆纸15万吨，如果顺利，18个月后即可投入生产。这样，不久的将来，南平厂的总生产能力可达30万吨。
    吴修和还告诉笔者，今年南平厂改变了供货办法。他们主动了解各主要报纸及用户单位纸张的缺额，订立供求合同，不必再求第三者，减少了中间环节，避免了“倒爷”从中做梗。
