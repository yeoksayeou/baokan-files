	The Pain of Uprooting

	In our area, several leaders from the town and village have, under the pretext of rushing to plant tobacco, ordered over ten households from the Fifth Brigade of Guangming Village to uproot their newly sprouted corn and almost ready-to-harvest potatoes and wheat. Those who refused were forced to do so by these leaders, who even demanded payment for their labor.

	Strangely, just a few days after the farmers uprooted their crops, these leaders notified them that they could replant the corn. This is utterly absurd!

	I ask these leaders who give such irrational orders: How can these farmers, who lack the technology for growing tobacco and have no drying houses, expect a good tobacco harvest? On what authority do you act? How do you explain uprooting the crops and then telling the farmers to replant them? "The key to a successful year lies in the spring," but now that spring is gone and summer is here, how can replanting the corn lead to a good harvest? How will the farmers get through the long 365 days?

    拔苗之苦
    我们这里的镇、村几个负责人，今年以须抢种烤烟为由，责令让光明村五四村民组十余户农户将刚出土不久的玉米及快要到手的马铃薯、小麦等自行拔掉，若有拒者，他们亦为其拔个精光，并说什么要农户付工钱。
    奇怪的是，他们在群众拔苗后不几天，又通知农户可以把玉米再度种上。真是荒唐之至！
    请问这些瞎指挥的领导们，这些农户既缺种烟技术，又缺烘房，怎样获得烤烟丰收？你们这样干，是谁给你们的权力？拔苗之后却通知再度种上又作何解释？“一年之计在于春”，既春光已去，夏日当空，再度种上玉米何言丰收？农户们又怎样度过那漫长的365天？
