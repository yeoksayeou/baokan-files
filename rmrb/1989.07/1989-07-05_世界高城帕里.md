A small town with only 1,960 residents, located at an altitude of 4,500 meters above the snow line, has thus become famous worldwide.

Compared to the crisscrossing narrow valleys, the area where the small town of Pari is located is a relatively flat expanse, covering approximately 850 square kilometers. The sky is blue with scattered white clouds, and the land is barren. Besides the occasional foxes and rabbits darting out from the roadside, there are virtually no woody plants.

In the town, the houses are low and monotonous, but signs of new construction are everywhere. Each household has colorful prayer flags fluttering in the wind on their roofs. The narrow streets are arranged in a scattered yet orderly fashion. Compared to the bustling city streets, they are quite tranquil. What leaves the deepest impression is the sheer number of dogs, which roam freely, either wagging their tails to beg for food from passersby or lounging in the middle of the road, forcing cars to detour. The entire town has over 400 dogs, consuming tens of kilograms of grain and meat daily. The streets, walls, and rooftops are all piled high with sod and cow dung; many house walls are plastered with cow dung cakes. These are used for cooking and heating. It is said that cow dung-baked steamed buns are particularly fragrant, and indeed, they are quite delicious.

Despite its high altitude, Pari has also experienced trials by fire and blood. In December 1903, British invaders occupied Pari; the following year, they continued their northward advance. When they reached the nearby village of Qumiganggar, the people of Pari, together with local Tibetan troops, bravely resisted with knives, spears, and homemade guns and cannons. They inflicted heavy casualties on the invading forces. The British commander, Younghusband, used the ruse of negotiations, ordering the Tibetan troops to extinguish the gunpowder fuses. Simultaneously, he commanded General MacDonald to lead the invading forces to open fire with steel cannons, machine guns, and rifles on the defenseless Tibetan troops and civilians, killing over 1,400 people on the spot. Qumiganggar was awash with blood. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, in March 1956, the road from Lhasa to Yadong via Pari was officially opened to traffic. From then on, Pari entered a new period of prosperity.

“Don’t underestimate this place,” said the town mayor, Dawang. “The pastures here are vast and fertile!”

I know this. The mountains around Pari are home to over a hundred varieties of excellent grasses from the Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Gentianaceae, and Brassicaceae families. Therefore, the yaks here are large and have strong carrying capacities. The goats and sheep are also fatter than those in other parts of Tibet. The development of livestock farming has promoted household handicrafts. Many families can weave carpets and sofa cushions from sheep wool and yak down. Just from this, the town’s annual income reaches 880,000 yuan.

Dryness, cold, and oxygen deficiency are the characteristics of Pari. However, it also has advantages that other places cannot match. Here, cordyceps, fritillary, snow lotus, coptis, and gentian grow. Last year, the town's medicinal herb income was over 280,000 yuan. The mushrooms grown at an altitude of over 7,000 meters in Pari are tender and fragrant, with a nutritional value three times higher than cultivated mushrooms. They can also treat conditions such as brain fatigue, chest tightness, and shortness of breath.

I asked Dawang, “How many ethnic groups live in the town?”

“There are two ethnic groups, Tibetan and Han. However,” Dawang smiled mysteriously, “there is only one Han person.”

I specially visited this Han compatriot's home. His name is Huang Changchun, from Sichuan. He enlisted in 1982 and was assigned to the armed police unit stationed in Pari. Because of his meritorious service, in 1985, he went to Beijing to attend an advanced representatives' meeting. In 1986, after his discharge, he insisted on staying, got married in the town, and registered his household. I asked him, “What do you love about this place?” He paused for a moment: “I love the ice peaks here!”

This answer truly surprised me.

Before visiting Huang Changchun's home, I stood at the town's intersection and looked northeast. A towering ice peak stood majestically, which is the Goddess Peak of the Zhumulangma Mountain on the China-Bhutan border, with a peak altitude of 7,371 meters. Below the peak is a large lake—Cumurji, whose water is salty. Strangely, during certain weather conditions, the area around Pari is filled with the scent of alcohol. According to geologists, this is due to certain geological reasons. The Kangbu hot springs below the snow mountain have 14 springs, with water temperatures ranging from 60 degrees Celsius, treating over a dozen ailments.

“Actually, Xiaohuang fell in love with our local girls!” Dawang nudged me with his elbow. In 1986, Xiaohuang married Dawazhuoma from the town's carpet factory. Now they have a lovely daughter, named Huang Xueping in Han and Pujianduo in Tibetan. They raise 10 yaks and run a small shop. From April 1987 to April 1989, they earned about 30,000 yuan, living a happy life.

Just as we were talking, Dawazhuoma returned from outside, carrying their two-year-old Pujianduo. She was slender, with a smile of happiness on her lips, and her face, like all Tibetan women, had a dark, ruddy complexion. She made butter tea for me and repeatedly urged me to drink another cup.

    世界高城帕里
    罗同松
    仅有1960人的小镇，坐落在海拔4500米的雪线上，因此名扬全球。
    与纵横交错的狭谷相比，小镇帕里所在的地域是一片比较平坦的原野，面积大约850平方公里。蓝天上片片白云，大地十分荒凉，路边除了不时窜出狐狸、野兔外，基本上没有木本植物。
    在镇里，房子低矮而单调，但是新建痕迹随处可见；各家房顶上都插着五颜六色的经幡，迎风招展。小街错落有致，与车水马龙的城市相较，倒是十分宁静。给人印象最深的是狗太多，到处乱窜，或向过路人摇尾求食，或徜徉马路中间逼得汽车绕道走。全镇400多条狗，每天耗粮耗肉大约几十公斤哩。街边、墙头和房顶全都堆放着草皮和牛粪；许多房屋的墙壁上，也扒满了牛粪饼子。这是煮食、取暖的燃料。听人说，牛粪烤馒头特别香，我尝过，的确不错。
    帕里尽管地势如此之高，却也经历过血与火的考验。1903年12月，英国侵略军队占领帕里；翌年继续北犯，当行至几公里外的曲米兴古时，帕里人民协同西藏地方军队用刀矛和土枪土炮英勇狙击，给了侵略军以重大杀伤。英军头目荣赫鹏玩弄假谈判阴谋，叫藏军将土枪的火绳熄灭。同时，他又命令麦克唐纳少将指挥侵略军，用钢炮、机枪和步枪向失去抵抗力的藏军和民众开火，当场杀死1400多人，曲米兴古血流成河。西藏和平解放后，1956年3月，拉萨经帕里至亚东的公路正式通车，至此，帕里重新进入兴盛时期。
    “别小看我们这地方”，帕里镇长达旺说，“这里的草场又宽又肥沃！”
    这我知道。帕里附近山区生长着禾本科、莎草科、龙胆科、十字花科等上百种优良牧草，所以这里的牦牛个大，载重能力忒强。山羊、绵羊也比西藏其他地方长得肥大。畜牧业的发展，促进了家庭手工业。许多人家能用羊毛、牛绒编织卡垫（壁毯、沙发垫之类）。仅此一端，全镇年收入就达88万元。
    干燥、寒冷、缺氧，是帕里的特点。不过也有着其他地方不可比拟的优势。这里生长虫草、贝母、雪莲、黄连、三花龙胆等名贵药材。去年，全镇药材收入28万多元。生长在海拔7000多米的帕里蘑菇，肉质细嫩，清香可口，比人工栽培的营养价值高3倍，还可以治疗脑衰、胸闷、气喘等疾病。
    我问达旺：“镇上住有几个民族？”
    “藏、汉两个民族。不过”，达旺诡秘地笑了笑，“汉族就一个人。”
    我特地来到这位汉族同胞家里去作客。他名叫黄长春，老家四川，1982年入伍，分配到驻帕里的武警部队服役。因为立了功，1985年到北京出席先进代表会议。1986年退伍后，他坚决留下来，在镇上结了婚，落了户口。我问他：“你爱上这里什么？”他略一沉吟：“爱这里的冰峰！”
    这个回答真使我惊讶不已。
    来黄长春家之前，我站在镇上路口向东北方向眺望，一座高耸的冰峰亭亭玉立，那是位于中国不丹边境卓木拉利雪山的神女峰，峰顶高度为海拔7371米。峰下一大湖——错木杰，湖水是咸的。说也怪，帕里周围有的地方遇上一定天气，便有酒香四溢。据地质学家分析，这是某种地理原因造成的。雪山下的康布温泉，有14个泉眼，喷出的水温度各不相同，最高的可达60度，治十多种疾病。
    “其实，小黄是爱上了我们这里的姑娘！”达旺用胳膊碰了我一下。1986年，小黄与镇上卡垫厂的达娃卓玛结了婚，如今已有个可爱的女儿，汉名黄雪苹，藏名普边多。他们家养了10头牦牛，开了爿铺店，从1987年4月到1989年4月，赚了大约3万元，小日子过得挺美满。
    正说着话，达娃卓玛抱着她两岁的普边多从外面回来了。她身材苗条，嘴角挂着幸福的微笑，脸部像所有藏族妇女一样，透着黝黑的红润。她为我打了酥油茶，而且一再劝我多喝一杯。
