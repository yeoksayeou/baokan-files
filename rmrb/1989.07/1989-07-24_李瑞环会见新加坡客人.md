    Li Ruihuan Meets with Singaporean Guests

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 24 — A member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Li Ruihuan, met with Singapore's former parliamentarian, Mr. Lam Siew Cheong, this afternoon in Zhongnanhai.

    Li Ruihuan briefed the guest on the situation in Beijing following the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot.

    Li Ruihuan pointed out that China's policy of reform and opening up, based on the Four Cardinal Principles, will not change. Reform and opening up, and the Four Cardinal Principles are consistent. It continually imparts new content to the Four Cardinal Principles. Those who instigated the turmoil and riot aimed to undermine the socialist foundation of the Four Cardinal Principles. If that happened, China would have no future.

    He also thanked Lam Siew Cheong for his work in the Tianjin Development Zone and in the exchange of talents between China and Singapore.

    Lam Siew Cheong expressed his belief that the destiny of China is in the hands of the Chinese people, who will handle their own affairs well.

    Lam Siew Cheong is a consultant for the China International Talent Exchange Foundation's Sino-Singapore Talent Exchange Affairs and an economic and technological advisor for the Tianjin Development Zone. Li Ruihuan has met with him several times in Tianjin.

    李瑞环会见新加坡客人
    新华社北京七月二十四日电　中共中央政治局常委李瑞环今天下午在中南海会见了新加坡原国会议员邝摄治先生。
    李瑞环向客人介绍了北京平息反革命暴乱的情况。
    李瑞环指出，中国在坚持四项基本原则的基础上实行改革开放的政策不会改变，改革开放和四项基本原则是一致的，它不断赋予四项基本原则以新的内容。搞动乱和暴乱的人就是要抽掉四项基本原则这一社会主义的根基。如果这样，中国就没有希望。
    他还感谢邝摄治先生在天津开发区工作和中国新加坡人才交流方面做了许多工作。
    邝摄治表示相信，中国的命运掌握在中国人的手里，中国人会把自己国内的事情处理好的。
    邝摄治是中国国际人才交流协会中新人才交流事务顾问和天津经济技术开发顾问，李瑞环在天津曾多次会见过他。
