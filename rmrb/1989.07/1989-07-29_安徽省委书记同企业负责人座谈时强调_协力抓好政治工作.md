Anhui Provincial Party Secretary Lu Rongjing met with party committee secretaries and factory directors from several enterprises in Hefei on July 25 and 27 to discuss the strategic planning for ideological education in enterprises. He emphasized that the party, government, trade unions, and youth leagues must work together as a unified force to manage and oversee the ideological and political work in enterprises, educating all workers to firmly remember the Party's "one center, two basic points," and to run the enterprises better.

Lu Rongjing addressed the concerns of some enterprises regarding the factory director responsibility system and the contract management system. He emphasized that these two effective reforms are in line with the Party and state policies and laws and will not change. He urged that any incomplete aspects be further improved to make the systems more perfect. Party committee secretaries should focus their main efforts on ideological and political work, better playing their role in ensuring and supervising. Factory directors must adhere to the principle of "two hands," consciously accepting the supervision of the party organization. Trade unions and the youth leagues should actively cooperate, working together to promote the spirit of selfless dedication, hard work, love for the factory, and the revitalization of China.

He mentioned that some enterprises have established labor service companies and other tertiary industries to solve the employment and living difficulties of workers' family members and children; established schools and kindergartens to address the issues of children's education and childcare; organized retired workers to patrol and guard the dormitory areas to prevent fires and theft, etc. These are all silent but effective forms of ideological work that stabilize workers' emotions and motivate their enthusiasm. Under the leadership's support, experiences should be summarized and these efforts should continue to be improved.

    安徽省委书记同企业负责人座谈时强调
    协力抓好政治工作
    本报合肥7月29日电　安徽省委书记卢荣景25日和27日约请合肥市一些企业党委书记、厂长共商企业思想教育大计。他指出，企业党政工团今后再也不能“各顾各、各管各”了，应该四位一体，齐抓共管企业思想政治工作，教育广大职工牢记党的“一个中心、两个基本点”，把企业办得更好。
    卢荣景针对一些企业对厂长负责制和承包经营制产生疑虑的情况，特别强调指出，这两项行之有效的改革，是符合党和国家政策法令的，是不会变的。不配套的要进一步配套，使它更加完善。党委书记要用主要精力抓思想政治工作，更好地发挥保证监督作用。厂长一定要坚持两手抓，自觉接受党组织的监督。工会、共青团要主动配合，齐心协力弘扬无私奉献、艰苦奋斗、爱我工厂、振兴中华的精神。
    他说，有些企业兴办了劳动服务公司等第三产业，解决职工家属、子女就业和生活困难；兴办学校、幼儿园，解决职工子女上学、入托问题；组织退休工人在宿舍区值班、巡逻，防火防盗等等，这都是安定职工情绪、调动职工积极性的一种无声有实的思想工作，应在领导的支持下，总结经验，继续抓好。
