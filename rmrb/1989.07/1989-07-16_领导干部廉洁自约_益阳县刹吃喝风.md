Leading cadres in Yiyang County, Hunan Province, have taken the initiative to curb extravagant entertainment practices. In just May and June, the county reduced its entertainment expenses by over 123,000 yuan.

In recent years, the problem of extravagant entertainment has been severe in Yiyang County. Some townships spent as much as 20,000 to 30,000 yuan annually on entertainment, while some county-level departments spent over 100,000 yuan. The total annual entertainment expenses for the county amounted to over 1 million yuan. In April, the county's Party committee, People's Congress, government, and Political Consultative Conference leaders discussed anti-corruption measures and decided to tackle the issue of extravagant entertainment as a key step in promoting clean governance. They established five self-disciplinary regulations, including "Regulations on Meals During Field Inspections and Receptions" and "Regulations on Not Accepting Gifts and Not Sending Gifts with Public Funds." Over the past two months, 22 out of 32 county-level cadres have conducted 107 days of field inspections, with none exceeding the standard meal allowance, and all have paid their meal expenses according to regulations.

    领导干部廉洁自约
    益阳县刹吃喝风
    据新华社长沙7月16日电  湖南省益阳县32名在职县级领导带头刹吃喝风，仅5、6两月，全县减少招待费12.3万余元。
    近几年，益阳县吃喝之风严重。有的乡镇一年开支的招待费多达二、三万元，县直机关有的局竟达10多万元。全县每年招待费的开支达100多万元。今年4月，县委、县人大、县政府、县政协的领导在讨论廉政建设时，决定把刹吃喝风作为加强廉政建设的突破口。他们制定了《关于下乡和接待用餐制度》和《关于不收受礼物和用公款送礼》等5项廉洁自约制度。两个月来，32名县级干部有22名下基层检查工作107天，无1人超标准就餐，并都按规定交了伙食费。
