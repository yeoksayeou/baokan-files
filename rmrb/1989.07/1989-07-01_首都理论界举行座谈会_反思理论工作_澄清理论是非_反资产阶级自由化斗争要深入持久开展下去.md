Theoretical workers in the capital held symposiums on June 30 and July 1 to reflect on the confusion that occurred in the ideological and theoretical front over a period of time. They discussed, in accordance with the important speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, how to clarify the confused theoretical issues and explore the use of Marxism to study new problems arising from modernization construction and reform and opening up.

At the two symposiums organized by the Theory Bureau of the Propaganda Department of the CPC Central Committee, the experts and scholars present reached a consensus: the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing have provided profound lessons for the theoretical circle; the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up are both indispensable and must be organically combined; the struggle against bourgeois liberalization must be carried out in depth and over a long period.

Wang Weicheng, deputy head of the Propaganda Department, presided over the symposium. He said that in the past few years, the theoretical circle has made due contributions to China's reform and construction. However, the struggle has been fierce. Due to the serious mistakes made by Zhao Ziyang, some theoretical workers who insisted on the Four Cardinal Principles were suppressed, excluded, and attacked in various ways, while those who advocated bourgeois liberalization were encouraged, supported, and indulged. Many major theoretical issues have been confused. The important speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee have great guiding significance for the theoretical circle in adhering to Marxism and clarifying theoretical issues.

Liu Guoguang, vice president of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, said in his speech that due to Zhao Ziyang's negative attitude towards opposing bourgeois liberalization, the anti-bourgeois liberalization struggle in the past few years was actually a mere formality, resulting in the increasing arrogance of bourgeois liberalization and the heavy obstacles faced by those who insisted on the Four Cardinal Principles and opposed bourgeois liberalization. He said that in the field of social sciences, an important manifestation of the bourgeois liberalization trend is the obliteration of the fundamental differences between socialism and capitalism, mainly reflected in the "convergence theory," which holds that socialism and capitalism can absorb each other without distinction, essentially replacing socialism with capitalism.

Wu Jianguo, editor of the "Seeking Truth" magazine, pointed out that those who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization not only negate the Four Cardinal Principles but also negate patriotism. In recent years, they have advocated bourgeois values and concepts, promoting self-centeredness, self-selection, and self-realization, ultimately leading to extreme individualism. Some even regard the Opium War and the War of Resistance Against Japan as historical reversals, believing that historical development can be arbitrarily chosen by them, with no necessity.

Professor Gong Shutao of Beijing Normal University said that under the pretext of criticizing the ethical system of China, extreme individualism is advocated, and irrationality and immorality are promoted, which can only turn the Chinese people into a loose sand again.

Zheng Hangsheng, vice president of Renmin University of China, said that in this turmoil, "democracy" is a term that has been abused and desecrated. A small number of people who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization and engage in political conspiracies, under the banner of democracy, have self-proclaimed themselves as "democracy fighters" and claimed to be engaged in "democratic movements," brazenly opposing the Party and socialism, attempting to overthrow the Communist Party, and subvert our People's Republic. Their various evil deeds are almost all done under the label of "democracy." Theoretical workers have the responsibility to clarify the confused issues they have created in the field of democracy.

Dong Xuewen, associate professor of Peking University, said that the problems in the ideological field are quite serious. Some people who stubbornly adhere to bourgeois liberalization have been advocating for privatization in the economy, pluralism in politics, liberalization in ideology, Westernization in culture, selfishness in ethics and morals, and decadence in literature and art in recent years. In the cultural and artistic field, the Marxist aesthetic and Mao Zedong's thoughts on art and literature are less propagated, while decadent, corrupt, and pessimistic works are rampant, and this situation needs to be rectified and cleaned up.

Xu Liqun, consultant of the Philosophy Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, talked about the issue of adhering to and developing Marxism. He said that some self-proclaimed "elites" in the theoretical circle are engaged in work against the Four Cardinal Principles. Their speeches are in line with the international anti-socialist trends. They negate public ownership, saying that insisting on socialism in China is a big mistake. Without insisting on public ownership and Marxism, reform and opening up will become reform and opening up centered on capitalism. Some people, under the pretext of developing Marxism, negate the inheritance and adherence to Marxism, but in reality, the inheritance and adherence to Marxism cannot be separated from its development. Without inheritance and adherence, there can be no development. To adhere to Marxism, we must first do a good job in the propaganda and education of Marxism. Now is a good opportunity, and we must seize the opportunity to improve the level of Marxist propaganda and truly occupy the theoretical high ground.

Wang Renzhi, head of the Propaganda Department, attended the symposium. He hoped that comrades on the ideological and theoretical front would recognize the long-term, complex, and arduous nature of the current struggle and actively engage in this struggle that concerns the future and destiny of the Party and the state. More than 20 experts and scholars from the capital's theoretical circle participated in the two symposiums.

### 首都理论界举行座谈会  反思理论工作　澄清理论是非  反资产阶级自由化斗争要深入持久开展下去

    首都理论界举行座谈会
    反思理论工作　澄清理论是非
    反资产阶级自由化斗争要深入持久开展下去
    新华社北京7月1日电　首都部分理论工作者6月30日、7月1日连续举行座谈会，对一段时期以来思想理论战线上出现的混乱进行回顾和反思，讨论按照邓小平同志的重要讲话和党的十三届四中全会精神，澄清被搞乱了的理论是非，探讨运用马克思主义研究现代化建设和改革开放中面临的新问题。
    在中宣部理论局组织召开的这两次座谈会上，与会的专家学者们达成了这样的共识：北京最近发生的动乱和反革命暴乱事件给理论界的教训是深刻的；四项基本原则和改革开放二者缺一不可，要有机地结合起来；反对资产阶级自由化的斗争要深入持久地开展下去。
    主持座谈会的中宣部副部长王维澄说，这几年理论界对我国的改革和建设作出了应有的贡献。但是斗争十分激烈。由于赵紫阳同志的严重错误，一些坚持四项基本原则的理论工作者受到了这样那样的压制、排斥和打击，而鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人却受到了纵容、鼓励和支持。许多重大的理论问题被搞乱了。邓小平同志的重要讲话和党的十三届四中全会精神，对理论界坚持马克思主义，澄清理论是非，有着重大的指导意义。
    中国社会科学院副院长刘国光在发言中说，由于赵紫阳同志对反对资产阶级自由化持消极态度，致使前几年的反对资产阶级自由化实际上走了过场，结果使得资产阶级自由化的气焰越来越盛，而坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的同志却遇到了重重阻力。他说，在社会科学领域中，资产阶级自由化思潮的一个重要表现是抹煞社会主义与资本主义的根本区别，主要反映有“趋同论”，即社会主义和资本主义可以无区别地相互吸收，实际上就是用资本主义代替社会主义。
    《求是》杂志社编委吴建国指出，顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人，不仅否定四项基本原则，甚至连爱国主义也加以否定。近年来，他们鼓吹资产阶级的价值取向和观念，宣扬以自我为中心，自我选择和自我实现，最后剩下的只是赤裸裸的极端个人主义。有的人甚至认为鸦片战争、抗日战争都是历史的逆动，在他们看来，历史的发展可以由他们任意选择，而没有什么必然性。北京师范大学教授龚书铎说，借批判中国伦理道德本位制，鼓吹极端个人主义，宣扬非理性，非道德，其结果只能使中国人重新成为一盘散沙。
    中国人民大学副校长郑杭生说，在这场大风波中，“民主”是一个被肆意滥用和糟踏的字眼。极少数顽固坚持资产阶级自由化、搞政治阴谋的人，打着民主的旗号，自封什么“民主斗士”，自称搞什么“民主运动”，猖狂反党反社会主义，妄图打倒共产党，颠覆我们的人民共和国。他们的种种恶行几乎都是在“民主”的标签下干的。理论工作者有责任把他们在民主问题上搞得非常混乱的是非加以澄清。
    北京大学副教授董学文说，意识形态领域发生的问题可以说是十分严重的，一些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化的人，近几年来一直在鼓吹经济上的私有化，政治上的多元化，思想上的自由化，文化上的西方化，伦理道德上的自私化，文艺上的腐朽化等。文化艺术领域中，马克思主义的文艺观和毛泽东的文艺思想宣传得少了，而一些腐朽的、堕落的、悲观的作品比比皆是，这种状况急需清理整顿。
    中国社会科学院哲学所顾问许力群谈了坚持和发展马克思主义问题。他说，理论界有些自称“精英”的人，搞的是反对四项基本原则的工作，他们的言论和国际上反对社会主义的思潮是相配合的，他们否定公有制，说什么在中国坚持社会主义就是坚持公有制是一个莫大的失误。不坚持公有制，不坚持马克思主义，改革开放就会变成以资本主义为中心的改革开放。有人借口发展马克思主义，否定对马克思主义的继承和坚持，实际马克思主义的继承和发展是不能分割的，没有继承和坚持就谈不上发展。要坚持马克思主义，首先要做好马克思主义的宣传、教育工作，现在是个极好的机会，我们要抓住时机，提高宣传马克思主义的水平，使其真正占领理论阵地。
    中宣部部长王忍之参加了座谈会。他希望思想理论战线上的同志认清当前斗争的长期性、复杂性和艰巨性，积极投身于这场关系到党和国家前途、命运的斗争中去。首都理论界的20多名专家、学者，参加了两次座谈会。
