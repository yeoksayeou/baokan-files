Two years ago, to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art," a large-scale symposium was held in Beijing, organized by the "China Yan'an Literature and Art Association" and other units. At that time, the domestic atmosphere was such that the first wave of bourgeois liberalization was rising, some college students took to the streets to protest, and the Party Central Committee took decisive action to prevent the turmoil and proposed to oppose bourgeois liberalization.

At the plenary and group meetings, famous artists who spoke included: Gu Yuan, Cai Ruohong, Hu Yichuan, Li Hua, Liu Kuichan, Wang Qi, Shao Yu, Luo Gongliu, Zhang Wang, Xin Mang, Wu Bidu, Gao Hong, Feng Fazhen, Hou Yimin, Li Qi, and some young and middle-aged artists. Everyone spoke enthusiastically. The most discussed topic was that "The Talks" were not "outdated" as some people claimed, but should be as Comrade Xiaoping pointed out in his speech at the Fourth National Congress of Literature and Art: "We must continue to adhere to the direction proposed by Comrade Mao Zedong that literature and art should serve the broadest masses of the people, primarily the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Many comrades sharply criticized various phenomena caused by the spread of bourgeois artistic thought due to bourgeois liberalization in the art world.

As one of the conveners of the art group, I was responsible for submitting the speeches to newspapers for publication. The editorial department of "Fine Arts" Monthly (the most influential art magazine in the country) wanted several articles, saying they would be used soon. However, more than a month passed with no news. When asked, the response was: those articles are no longer needed, saying that they heard a report from higher authorities and those articles did not align with the spirit of the report.

Around the same time, two national art newspapers also did the same. One also submitted articles saying they would be published but did not; another said they would come to interview me but did not. Even a newspaper aimed at intellectuals did the same, deciding to report on the art symposium, with several speeches ready for typesetting, but it was canceled overnight.

At that time, I was truly puzzled, why were the voices calling for socialist art so suppressed?!

Not long after, a report by Zhao Ziyang was circulated. Now the truth is clear, it was the General Secretary who was opening the door wide for the spread of bourgeois artistic thought.

Precisely because of this, the past two years have seen an increase in decadent Western goods in the art world. At an exhibition in the National Art Museum of China (which is like Tiananmen Square for the art world), there were performances of washing feet and selling shrimp, which were called "performance art." There were even lawless individuals who shot their own works, calling it "recreation."

The gunshots in the art museum were indeed a warning, and they cannot but make people reflect deeply!

Undeniably, since the reform and opening up, China's literary and artistic undertakings have overcome the previous state of confinement and have developed. In the future, we should continue to "open up and activate." However, liberating the mind should not lose the correct direction. Looking at the implementation of the "Two Hundreds" policy over the years, it can be said that there is only freedom for the spread of bourgeois artistic thought, but no freedom to propagate Marxist artistic thought. Not to mention resisting and criticizing bourgeois artistic thought. As soon as you open your mouth, you will be labeled as "extreme leftist," "stick," and your hair will be pulled. There is no atmosphere for debate and discussion. The misfortune of that batch of artists' manuscripts is very illustrative.

As for the fact that our literature and art should have a "big framework" as pointed out by Premier Zhou, and should have the characteristics of socialist China, from this perspective, the problem is even more serious.

The convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and the adjustment of the central leadership have strengthened our confidence. I believe that a truly flourishing situation of socialist literature and art with Chinese characteristics, embodying the policies of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" and "serving the people and serving socialism," will definitely appear.

I have always kept that batch of artists' manuscripts, and I believe they will see the light of day again.

    一批美术家文稿的厄运
    李琦
    两年前，为纪念毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表四十五周年，由“中国延安文艺学会”等团体和单位牵头，在京召开了一次文艺界的大型座谈会。当时的国内气候是，资产阶级自由化思潮掀起第一个大浪头、部分大学生上街游行、党中央果断地防止了动乱并提出反对资产阶级自由化之后。
    在大会、分组会上发言的著名美术家有：古元、蔡若虹、胡一川、李桦、刘开渠、王琦、邵宇、罗工柳、张望、辛莽、伍必端、高虹、冯法禩、侯一民、李琦等和部分中青年美术家。大家发言十分踊跃。谈得最多的是认为《讲话》并不像有些人所说的“过时了”，而应如小平同志在四次文代会《祝辞》中指出的：“我们要继续坚持毛泽东同志提出的文艺为最广大的人民群众首先为工农兵服务的方向”。许多同志针对资产阶级自由化引来的资产阶级文艺思潮在美术界泛滥的种种现象提出了尖锐批评。
    我做为美术组召集人之一，负责将发言稿送交报刊发表。《美术》月刊（全国影响最大的美术刊物）编辑部要去几篇，说是很快用。然而，一个多月过去了，却毫无音讯。一问，回答是：那批稿子不用了，说是最近听了上面的报告，那批稿子跟上面的精神不合。
    也在那时，全国两家美术报，一家也是交去稿子说要登而没有登；另一家说要来访问我而没有来。连一家面向知识分子的报纸也是如此，已决定报道美术界座谈会，几篇发言稿都准备排版了，一夜之间又作罢。
    那阵子，我真是百思不得其解，为什么为社会主义文艺呼喊的声音这么受压？！
    过了没多久，赵紫阳的一个报告传达下来了。现在真相大白，是总书记在为资产阶级文艺思潮的泛滥大开方便之门。
    正由于如此，美术界近两年西方腐朽货色有增无减。在中国美术馆（这有如美术界的天安门广场）一个展览会上，有洗脚的，有卖虾的，这叫做“行动艺术”。更有目无法纪者，开枪射击自己的作品，这名之曰：“再创造”。
    美术馆的枪声，实在是一个警报，它不能不引起人们深深地反思了！
    无可否认，改革开放以来，我国的文艺事业克服了以往的禁锢状态是有所发展的。今后仍应当继续“开放搞活”。但是，解放思想不应当失却正确方向。这些年，拿“二百”方针执行情况看，可以说只有资产阶级文艺思潮泛滥的自由，而无宣传马克思主义文艺思想的自由。更不要说对资产阶级文艺思潮进行抵制和批判了。你一开口，就要被扣上“极‘左’”、“棍子”等帽子，还要揪你的辫子。根本没有争鸣和讨论的气候。那批美术家文稿的厄运，是很能说明问题的。
    至于说，我们的文艺应该像周总理指出的“要有个大框框”，应该具有社会主义中国特色，从这方面看，问题就更多了。
    党的十三届四中全会的召开，中央领导班子的调整，使我们增强了信心。我相信，一个真正体现“百花齐放、百家争鸣”、“为人民服务，为社会主义服务”方针的、具有中国特色的社会主义文艺的繁荣局面，是一定会出现的。
    我一直保存着的那批美术家的文稿，相信也会重见天日。
                    1989、“七一”
    编后：
    最近，美术家李琦同志寄来《一批美术家文稿的厄运》以及文中所谈到的部分美术家在1987年5月举行的文艺界纪念《讲话》座谈会上的发言稿。现将其中古元、王琦两同志的发言与李琦同志的文章一并刊载于此。
