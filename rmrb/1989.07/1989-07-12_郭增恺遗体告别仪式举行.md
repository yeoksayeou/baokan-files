Chen Shifan, Luo Qingchang, and others paid their respects to Guo Zengkai's body.

Guo Zengkai passed away on July 2 in Beijing due to illness, at the age of 87. As early as the democratic revolution period, Guo Zengkai had done a lot of work beneficial to the country and the people. In the 1930s, he sympathized with the Chinese Communist Party. After the Xi'an Incident, he supported the Party's proposal to peacefully resolve the Xi'an Incident and made his own contribution to the peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident. After the founding of New China, he was in Hong Kong but had a heart for the motherland, working tirelessly for the country and the people, doing many good deeds. He firmly supported the country's advocacy for peaceful reunification and worked hard for it. After experiencing decades of ups and downs, he realized that the Chinese Communist Party is the only hope for the Chinese nation. In his later years, he expressed his wish to join the Chinese Communist Party and fulfilled this long-cherished wish in 1986. He finally transformed from a patriot and democrat into a communist; from a sincere friend of the Communist Party into a vanguard fighter of the proletariat. His life was one of pursuing light, revolution, and progress with the times, a life of continuous dedication to the country and the nation.

    郭增恺遗体告别仪式举行
    新华社北京7月11日电  中国共产党党员、第六届全国政协常委郭增恺同志的遗体告别仪式今天下午在八宝山革命公墓礼堂举行。
    郭增恺同志遗体安卧在翠柏鲜花丛中，身上覆盖着中国共产党党旗。彭真、邓颖超、乔石、薄一波、王首道、刘澜涛、程子华、习仲勋、陈慕华、费孝通、孙起孟、雷洁琼、王汉斌、王任重、阎明复、杨静仁、康克清、帕巴拉·格列朗杰、胡子昂、周培源、王光英、邓兆祥、赵朴初、屈武、巴金、马文瑞、刘靖基、王恩茂、钱学森、钱伟长、孙晓村、侯镜如、杨成武、陈再道、吕正操、汪锋以及郭增恺同志的亲属、生前友好送了花圈。全国人大常委会、全国政协、中央组织部、中央统战部、中央对台办、国务院港澳办以及河北省委、省人大、省政府、省政协也送了花圈。
    程思远、罗青长等向郭增恺同志遗体告别。
    郭增恺同志因病于7月2日在北京逝世，终年87岁。早在民主革命时期，郭增恺同志就做了一些利国利民的工作。他在30年代就同情中国共产党。“西安事变”发生后，他拥护我党提出的和平解决“西安事变”的主张，为促成“西安事变”的和平解决做出了自己的贡献。新中国成立后，他身在香港心怀祖国，为国家、为人民孜孜不倦，做了许多好事。他坚决拥护祖国和平统一的主张，并为此不断积极努力。在经历了几十年的风风雨雨之后，他更加认识到中国共产党是中华民族的唯一希望，在晚年提出了加入中国共产党的要求，并在1986年实现了这个夙愿。他终于从一个爱国主义者、民主主义者成为一个共产主义者；从一个共产党的真诚朋友，成为一名无产阶级的先锋战士。他的一生，是不断追求光明、追求革命、与时俱进的一生，是为国家、为民族不断奉献的一生。
