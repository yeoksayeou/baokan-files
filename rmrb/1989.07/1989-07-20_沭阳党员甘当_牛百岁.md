Party members in Shuyang County, Jiangsu Province, are actively organizing to help local residents become prosperous.

Currently, 687 village party branches in 38 townships across the county have established a system of linking households, with over 30,000 party members participating in this initiative. With the help of these party members, more than 10,000 impoverished households have shed their poverty and embarked on the path to wealth.

In the past, Hu Dao Kou Village in Za Xian Township was known throughout the county as a poor village. In recent years, the 62 party members of the village, under the leadership of the party branch, have proposed the slogan "No one will be left behind on the road to prosperity." They raised funds to establish 11 economic cooperatives, including building materials, weaving, livestock breeding, and grain processing. All the poor households in the village were recruited into these cooperatives, enabling them to quickly escape poverty and become prosperous. Now, the village's per capita annual income has reached 650 yuan, making it a well-known affluent village in the county.

Sun Weide, a party member from Wu Li Village in Nan Guan Township, runs a reputable and profitable coal-saving boiler factory. He proactively linked up with more than a dozen impoverished households in the village, inviting them to the factory to learn technical skills and business management, helping them to gradually escape poverty and become prosperous.

The people of Shuyang affectionately refer to these party members as "our 'Bull Centenarians'."

    沭阳党员甘当“牛百岁”
    本报讯　江苏省沭阳县各级党组织积极组织党员尽心助民致富。
    目前，这个县38个乡镇的687个农村党支部都建立了联系户制度，参加这项活动的党员达3万多名。在党员帮助下，先后有1万多贫困户摘掉贫困帽子，走上富路。
    扎下乡胡道口村曾是全县闻名的穷村。近几年来，该村62名党员在党支部的带领下，提出“致富路上不拉下一个贫困户”的口号，他们自筹资金，先后办起了建材、编织、畜禽饲养、粮食加工等11个经济联合体，将全村贫困户全部招收进去，使其很快脱贫致富。现在，该村人均年收入已达650元，成了全县有名的富裕村。
    南关乡五里村党员孙伟德自办的节煤锅炉厂信誉高、效益好，孙伟德主动联系本村十几个贫困户，将他们请进厂传技术、教经营，使他们相继脱贫致富。
    沭阳群众亲切地称这些党员为“咱这儿的‘牛百岁’”。
