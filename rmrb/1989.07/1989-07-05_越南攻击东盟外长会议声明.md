Vietnam Criticizes ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting Statement

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 5th: The official newspaper of the Vietnamese Communist Party, "Nhan Dan" (People's Daily), published a commentary today criticizing the joint statement issued by the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting on July 3rd regarding the political resolution of the Cambodian issue as "a countercurrent."

	This is the first response from the Vietnamese authorities to the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting, which primarily discussed the Cambodian issue.

	The commentary in "Nhan Dan" accused the ASEAN Foreign Ministers' Meeting statement of "deliberately denying the Jakarta Informal Meeting," claiming it sets "obstacles" for the political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

	Observers here believe that the official reaction from Hanoi's newspaper casts a shadow over the prospects for a political resolution of the Cambodian issue.

    越南攻击东盟外长会议声明
    据新华社河内7月5日电　越共机关报《人民报》今天发表评论文章，攻击东盟外长会议3日发表的关于政治解决柬埔寨问题的联合声明是“一股逆流”。
    这是越南当局对这次以柬埔寨问题为主要议题的东盟外长会议作出的首次反应。
    《人民报》的评论指责东盟外长会议的声明“故意否认雅加达非正式会晤”，是为政治解决柬问题“设置障碍”。
    此间观察家们认为，河内官方报纸的上述反应给政治解决柬问题的前景投下了阴影。
