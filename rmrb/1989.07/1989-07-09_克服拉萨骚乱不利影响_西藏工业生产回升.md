Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, July 9th.

The initial signs of recovery in Tibet's industrial production, which had previously declined, are now apparent.

Due to the impact of the Lhasa riots in March this year, Tibet's industrial production experienced a downturn in the first quarter. The total industrial output value only achieved 8.93% of the annual plan, a decrease of 7.58% compared to the same period last year. Among these, Lhasa's ethnic handicraft industry saw a 30% decline compared to the same period last year. The Tibet Autonomous Region government promptly implemented measures. In May, the total industrial output value for the entire region increased by 33.47% compared to April, and in June, it grew by 27.72% compared to May. The ethnic handicraft industry also matched the level of the same period last year.
