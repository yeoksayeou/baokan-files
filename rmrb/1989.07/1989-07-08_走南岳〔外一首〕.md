    A Visit to Mount Heng [and another poem]
    Zhou Zhide

    Above me is your sky of blue and clouds of white,
    Deeper than yours is my longing and my plight.
    When the mountain stream's whispers fade in mist,
    When my footprints turn to tears that never cease,
    In the place where you stand,
    There are only shadows, layer upon layer.
    Those calm words sway with a light, easy grace,
    And from this world, I believe,
    There is another kind of sincerity.
    The wind and rain across the mountains,
    Awaken my dull and weary gaze.
    Those colorful fallen petals,
    Slip from your shoulders.
    Your sky of blue, your clouds of white,
    Are left with nothing but endless conjecture.
    As long as the sun is in the sky,
    There are as many blades of grass as there are peaks.
    A thousand years would not be enough to count them all.
    The Station
    Between the end and the beginning,
    You support day and night with your longing.
    Those who should part, part;
    Those who should stay, stay.
    Yesterday is just an old, ruined site,
    Collapsed walls, broken bridges, steep cliffs,
    All crumble down.
    On the coordinates of history,
    You connect all hopes.
    In truth, you never dared to answer lightly
    About tomorrow.
    The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers are accustomed to their twists and turns,
    You, with your straight spine,
    Bear all burdens, lifting and setting them down.

    走南岳〔外一首〕
    周之德
    高过我的是你的蓝天白云
    深过你的是我的苦苦盼望
    当山溪的絮语失落在雾中
    当我的足迹成为一串泪痕
    在你站立的位置上
    只有重重叠叠的倒影
    那平静的话语摇曳着轻松
    从此世界令我相信
    还有另一种真诚
    满山的风声雨声
    唤醒了我钝滞的目光
    那些多采的落英
    从你的肩头滑落了
    你的蓝天　你的白云
    只剩下无端的猜想
    只要太阳在头上
    有多少小草　就有多少座山峰
    一千年也难以记牢数清
    车站
    在终点与起点之间
    你用向往支撑起白天和黑夜
    该分手的就分手
    该留下的就留下
    昨天只是一个古旧的遗址
    残壁、断桥、峭岩
    都轰然崩塌
    在历史的坐标上
    你连接起所有的企盼
    其实你从来不敢对明天
    轻松自如地作答
    长江黄河习惯于曲曲弯弯
    你才用耿直的脊梁
    将一切重负扛上又卸下
