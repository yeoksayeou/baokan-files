	How to Handle Private Property Owners' Land Use Rights During Demolition

	Question: I own 12 private rooms in the urban area of Xi'an, covering approximately 5 mu of land. Last October 27, the Municipal Housing and Land Bureau mobilized residents in this area to relocate, as the government plans to redevelop the area into commercial buildings. On October 20 of the same year, the Municipal Land Bureau announced the registration of land use rights. An official from the Municipal Housing and Land Bureau told me that since the government is developing and redeveloping your residential area, you do not need to register; the land is already state-owned, and apart from compensating for the value of the house, there is no other compensation for the land.

	I would like to ask: Is it reasonable and legal for the Housing and Land Bureau not to compensate the original land users? How should the development unit handle the land use rights of private property owners during demolition and resettlement?

	Answer: Urban demolition and construction projects in our country are carried out according to the overall urban planning requirements and in accordance with legal procedures. The initiators of construction projects, whether they are state-owned units, collective units, or individuals, as long as they are officially approved, are included in the implementation of urban planning, which is a manifestation of the will of the state. Therefore, the owners and users of properties within the demolition range, including private houses, should comply with the needs of state construction and cooperate in the demolition work.

	During the demolition, the rights and interests of private property owners involve two aspects: one is the ownership and housing rights of houses, trees, and other above-ground structures, and the other is the use rights of the land base and courtyard. The former reflects the civil legal relationship between equal subjects of the demolisher and the demolished, and the demolisher should compensate the property owner for the loss of above-ground structures according to the relevant regulations of urban demolition and the principle of equivalence, as well as the costs and damages incurred from moving and temporary transitional housing. At the same time, the demolisher should also properly arrange the housing of the users according to the area of the demolished house. The latter reflects the power and obligations of the state to the property owner in terms of land use. The Constitution of our country clearly stipulates that "urban land belongs to the state," so regardless of the source of the land occupied by private houses, the property owner no longer enjoys ownership, but only retains the use right in the case that the state does not expropriate it. Currently, the state land use system has been established, but it has not been universally implemented. Urban private property owners either use state land without charge or only pay a certain amount of land use tax during the actual use period, and the system of purchasing land use rights for a certain period has not been implemented. Therefore, the state's expropriation of land occupied by private houses in urban demolition is only a manifestation of the state's administrative decision to recover land use rights. The property owner, in accordance with the obligations stipulated in the Constitution, terminates the continued use of state land, and in terms of economic rights and interests, there is neither an agreement nor a restriction on the term of land use rights, nor is there any infringement or damage, so there is no compensation issue.

	The land within the designated demolition range has already been registered for land use rights by the initiator of the construction project, and the demolished party no longer enjoys the right to continue using the land and does not need to register again.

### 拆迁房屋如何对待私房主的土地使用权？

    拆迁房屋如何对待私房主的土地使用权？
    问：我在西安市区有私房12间，占地约5分。去年10月27日，市房地局动员我们这一带居民搬迁，政府计划在这里改建商品楼。同年10月20日，市土地局公告进行土地使用权登记。市房地局工作人员对我说：政府在你住区开发改建，你不需要登记；土地已经国有，除房屋按价折换外，其它土地也没有什么补偿。
    请问：房地局对原土地使用者不予补偿，这合理合法吗？开发单位在拆迁安置中如何对待私房主的土地使用权？

    答：我国城市的拆迁和建设项目是按照城市总体规划要求依照法定程序进行的，建设项目的筹建者，不论是全民单位、集体单位还是个人，凡是经过正式批准的，即纳入了城市规划的实施中，都是社会总体利益的需要，应视为国家意志的体现。因此，拆迁范围内包括私房在内的房产所有人和使用人，均应服从国家建设需要，配合做好拆迁工作。
    拆迁中涉及私人房主两方面权益，一是房屋、树木等地上物的所有权和住房权，二是房基地及庭院用地的使用权。前者反映了拆迁人与被拆迁人发生的平等主体间的民事法律关系，拆迁人应按照城市拆迁的有关规定，遵循等价原则补偿房主地上物的损失，以及补偿因搬家和临时过渡住房所发生的费用和损耗，同时，拆迁人还应按拆迁房屋的面积妥善安置使用人的住房。后者反映了国家对房主在土地使用方面的权力和义务。我国宪法明确规定了“城市的土地属于国家所有”，因此，私房占用的土地无论来源情况，房主都不再享有所有权，只是在国家不征用的情况下保留土地使用权。目前，国家土地有偿使用制度已经确立，但还没有普遍实施，城市私房所有人或者是无偿使用国家土地，或者是只在实际使用期间交纳一定的土地使用税，没有实行购买一定期限的土地使用权制度。因此，城市拆迁征用私房占用的土地，仅体现了国家以行政决定方式收回土地使用权。房主依照宪法规定的义务终止继续使用国家土地，在经济权益关系方面，既无土地使用权租期的约定和限制，又没有侵权和损害的发生，不存在补偿问题。
    已设定拆迁范围内的土地，由建设项目的筹建者履行土地使用权登记，被拆迁人不再享有继续使用该土地的权能，无需再行登记。
