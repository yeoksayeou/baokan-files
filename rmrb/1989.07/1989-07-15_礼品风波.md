    The Gift Controversy
    Lü Jí

    During Gorbachev's visit to France, President Mitterrand decided to present the Soviet guests with a pair of pistols famously used by the renowned Russian poet Pushkin in a duel that ultimately led to his death. The gift, however, sparked a controversy before it was even handed over.

    A week before Gorbachev's arrival, the mayor of the small town of Amboise, located on the Loire River and with a population of just over ten thousand, received a call from the presidential palace. The call informed him that France intended to gift Pushkin's pistols to Gorbachev, which were stored in the town's postal museum. The mayor was left in a difficult position.

    Under pressure from the Élysée Palace and the Ministry of Culture, the mayor of Amboise had no choice but to watch as the precious artifacts were taken away after ensuring that replicas were made for the museum. It is said that these pistols, used by Pushkin in his fatal duel with his rival on January 27, 1837, were purchased by a French businessman who had read Pushkin's "The Stationmaster." The businessman later donated them to the Amboise museum.

    A friend of the collector and former Prime Minister under de Gaulle, the previous mayor of Amboise, Debré, expressed his outrage. He told the press, "This is a shameful act of theft by the French government and the President of the Republic."

    It is reported that the Soviet Union plans to display Pushkin's pistols in a museum.

    礼品风波
    吕吉
    戈尔巴乔夫访法期间，密特朗总统赠送给苏联客人的礼物是著名俄国诗人普希金用于格斗而致命的两把手枪。礼品尚未送出，却招来一场风波。
    还在戈氏抵法前的一个周末，罗瓦尔河畔一个仅万余居民的昂布瓦斯市市长接到总统府打来的电话，说法国将向戈尔巴乔夫赠送普希金的手枪，手枪存放于昂市的邮政博物馆内。法国政府的这一决定使市长束手无策。
    在爱丽舍宫和文化部的压力下，昂市市长在要求为博物馆制作了复制品后，只能眼睁睁看着来人取走了这一珍贵文物。据说，1837年1月27日普希金与其情敌决斗时曾使用过的这两把手枪，是法国一位企业家在读了普希金的《驿车车夫》后，从一个私人收藏家那里购来的，后捐赠昂市博物馆。
    收藏家的朋友、戴高乐执政时期的总理、昂市前任市长德勃雷对将手枪送给戈尔巴乔夫表示愤慨。他对新闻界说，这是法国政府和共和国总统的“可耻的偷窃行为”。
    据说苏联将把普希金的这两把手枪陈列在一家博物馆内。
