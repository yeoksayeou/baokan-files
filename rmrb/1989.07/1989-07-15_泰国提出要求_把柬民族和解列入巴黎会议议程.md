Thailand has proposed that France include the national reconciliation among various Cambodian factions in the draft agenda for the upcoming international conference on the Cambodian issue to be held in Paris.

According to local newspapers quoting government officials, the Thai side believes that discussions on national reconciliation among Cambodian factions are key to the success of the Paris conference, which is scheduled to be held on July 30.

Government officials revealed that the Thai Ministry of Foreign Affairs is concerned that if this issue is not included in the agenda, the Cambodian problem can only be partially resolved, rather than the comprehensive solution desired by ASEAN.

    泰国提出要求
    把柬民族和解列入巴黎会议议程
    新华社曼谷7月15日电  泰国已要求法国将柬埔寨各派间的民族和解列入即将在巴黎召开的柬埔寨问题国际会议的议程草案。
    据当地报纸援引政府官员的话说，泰国方面认为，对柬埔寨各派间民族和解的讨论，是将于7月30日召开的巴黎会议成功的关键。
    政府官员们透露，泰国外交部担心，会议若不将此列入议程，柬埔寨问题只能得到部分解决，而不是东盟所希望的全面解决。
