The U.S. political system has a tradition of what is known as "political spoils" — that is, the elected president nominates his close associates and campaign supporters for public office. Diplomatic posts are also part of this "political spoils" system. There have been numerous instances where individuals with no diplomatic experience were appointed to diplomatic positions, causing much controversy. For example, John Lewis, appointed by Reagan as the U.S. Ambassador to the UK, was once ridiculed by senior professional diplomats as being "qualified only because he speaks English."

So far, out of the sixty diplomatic positions nominated by the Bush administration, forty-seven have little or no diplomatic experience. The most controversial nominee is Sedgewick, who was nominated to be the U.S. Ambassador to Italy.

This individual is a U.S. timber magnate and millionaire who contributed significantly to Bush's victory in the Michigan state primary. He is known for his vulgar language, and even in public and during press conferences, he does not hold back. After the news of his appointment spread, Italian newspapers dubbed him the "Profanity Ambassador." Although some members of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee had reservations about this appointment, no one wanted to make a fuss over such a small matter with Bush, so they passed the nomination with a vote of thirteen to zero.

Other diplomatic appointments by the Bush administration include: the U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg, who is a senior fundraiser for the Republican Party; the U.S. Ambassador to Finland, who is the chairman of an oil company and a member of Bush's 1988 fundraising committee; the U.S. Ambassador to Spain, who is a Florida land developer and one of the two national chairs of Bush's fundraising committee; the U.S. Ambassador to New Zealand, who is a real estate broker from Seattle and oversaw Bush's campaign activities in Washington state. After her nomination, she told a New Zealand newspaper that she had little interest in diplomatic affairs and did not know the name of the country's prime minister; the U.S. Ambassador to Australia, who is a retail giant from Florida and has donated $100,000 to the Republican Party.

Additionally, there is Hector, who was appointed as the U.S. Ambassador to the Bahamas. He once served as a senator from Nevada, but he is more famous for his speeches filled with misspellings and incoherent language. When asked by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee about his qualifications for the ambassadorship, he replied that the lifestyle in the Bahamas is similar to that in Nevada.

### “政治分肥”：美国的大使任命

    “政治分肥”：美国的大使任命
    美国政治制度中有所谓“政治分肥”的传统——即当选总统提名其亲信及竞选支持者担任公职。驻外使节职务亦是这种“政治分肥”的内容之一。任命毫无外交经验的人担任外交官，以至引起议论的事例委实不少。例如，被里根任命为驻英公使的约翰·路易斯，就曾被资深职业外交官讥为“唯一合格的地方就是会说英语。”
    迄今为止，布什政府提名的六十个外交职位人选中，有四十七人属于很少或毫无外交经验的。其中引起最大争议者是被提名为驻意大利大使的塞奇亚。
    此公为美国木材巨商，百万富翁，为布什在密歇根州取得党内竞选胜利颇有劳绩。此公好说粗俗秽语，在公众场合和会见记者时亦不稍有收敛。任命之说传开后，意大利报纸将他称为“脏话大使”。美国参院外委会虽有人对此项任命颇多腹诽，但均不愿为此小事和布什搞僵，遂以十三比零的票数通过这一任命。
    布什政府的外交任命中还有：驻卢森堡大使是共和党政治资金的高级募集人；驻芬兰大使是一石油公司董事长，布什一九八八年资金募集委员会成员；驻西班牙大使是佛罗里达土地开发商，布什的资金募集委员会的全国两主席之一；驻新西兰公使是西雅图的地产经纪人，主持过布什在华盛顿州的竞选活动。她在被提名后对新西兰报纸说，她对外交事务无甚兴趣，不知该国的总理是何姓名；驻澳大利亚大使是佛罗里达的零售巨头，向共和党捐过十万美元。
    此外，还有一个被任命为驻巴哈马使节的赫克特，此公曾当过内华达州的参议员，但更使他出名的是他那别字迭出，语无伦次的演说。当参院外委会问及他当大使的资格时，他回答说，巴哈马的生活方式和内华达差不多。
