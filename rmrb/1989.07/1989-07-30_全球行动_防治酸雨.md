Lakes that once sparkled with light, clear enough to see the bottom, now lack a vibrant ecosystem. Forests that were once lush and green are now withered and dying. Scientists have confirmed that the culprit behind these disasters is the "sky killer"—acid rain. It poses a severe threat to the global ecological environment, impacts economic development, and endangers human survival.

However, acid rain can be prevented. The primary cause of acid rain is the large amounts of sulfur dioxide produced from the burning of coal and oil. If these emissions are released into the atmosphere without treatment, they will undoubtedly harm humans. If treated, they can be turned into valuable products like sulfuric acid, which are urgently needed in agriculture and industry, benefiting humanity. Reducing emissions is the fundamental way to prevent acid rain. Some countries in Western Europe and North America have begun installing desulfurization equipment to remove sulfur dioxide from exhaust gases before they leave the chimneys.

Recently, representatives from 24 countries in the East and West jointly signed an agreement, calling for a freeze on the emission of nitrogen oxides that cause acid rain. Some representatives from Western European countries also demanded significant reductions in emissions from cars, trucks, and power plants. Sweden and Austria have already mandated that new cars must be equipped with catalytic converters to reduce exhaust emissions.

Each country must take responsibility for preventing acid rain, but international cooperation is also crucial. Acid rain, carried by winds and clouds, can travel long distances. For example, 70% of the sulfur oxides in the air over Norway and Sweden come from West Germany, Britain, and other Western European countries. Half of the sulfur oxides deposited in eastern Canada come from the industrial areas of the eastern United States. Acid rain knows no borders. Industrialized countries are severely affected by acid rain, but developing countries are also under threat. Countries like India, Southeast Asia, Brazil, and Nigeria are already experiencing soil acidification, forest dieback, and fish kills. Even countries that have not yet been severely affected by acid rain recognize the importance of prevention. Therefore, preventing acid rain requires global cooperation, information sharing, joint research, and the implementation of relevant policies to form a "global action."

    全球行动　防治酸雨
    张友新
    波光粼粼的湖泊，清澈见底，却见不到丰富多彩的生物世界；昔日郁郁葱葱的森林，如今却枝叶凋零，纷纷死去。科学家们证实，造成这类灾害的罪魁祸首是“空中死神”——酸雨，它严重地危及世界生态环境，影响经济发展，威胁人类的生存
  （见图）。
    然而，酸雨是可以防治的。酸雨主要是由煤炭和石油燃烧过程中产生大量二氧化硫而引起的。如果对废气不加处理就排入天空，势必危害人类；如果处理后排放，可以变废为宝，生产成工农业急需的硫酸产品，为人类造福。减少废气的排放是防治酸雨的根本办法。西欧、北美一些国家已着手安装除硫设备，在废气离开烟囱前就消除二氧化硫。
    不久前，来自东方、西方的24个国家代表共同签署了协定书，呼吁冻结导致酸雨形成的氧化氮气体的排放量，一些西欧国家代表还要求大幅度减少小汽车、卡车和发电厂的废气排放量。瑞典和奥地利已作出规定，新汽车必须安装汽油催化变换器，以减少废气排出。
    各国防治酸雨既要“各人自扫门前雪”，又要加强国际合作。酸雨借助于风行云移，能够长途跋涉、远距离迁移。挪威、瑞典大气中70％的硫氧化物来自西德、英国和其他一些西欧国家，加拿大东部沉降的硫氧化物中50％来自美国东部工业区。酸雨是没有国界的。工业国家酸雨危害甚烈，但发展中国家也受到酸雨的侵扰。印度、东南亚、巴西、尼日利亚等国家和地区已经出现水土酸化、森林枯萎和鱼类死亡等现象，那些尚未深受酸雨之害的国家也痛感到防患于未然的重要。所以，防治酸雨需要世界各国通力合作，相互交换信息，共同进行必要的调查研究，切实推行有关政策，形成“全球行动”。（附图片）
