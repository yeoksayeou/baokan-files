On the streets of Prague, if you ask for directions in Russian, German, or English, the response is often in the same language, providing a satisfactory answer. When reporters visit factories, government offices, and schools, the officials there can usually converse in a foreign language. This reflects, to some extent, the cultural level of the Czech people and the achievements of Czechoslovakia's education system over the past 41 years.

According to the educational system established after the 1976 reform, all children aged 3-6 have the opportunity to attend kindergarten, all 6-year-olds can enter an 8-year basic school, and after graduation, they must study for at least 2 years in a higher-level school. Approximately 20% of graduates enter a 4-year senior high school, from which some go to university and others start working. Another 20% of graduates enter a 4-year vocational school, including kindergarten teacher training, and after graduation, they start working or can apply to university. The remaining 60% of graduates attend various technical schools and apprentice schools, with study periods ranging from 2 to 4 years, and after graduation, they immediately start working. The university system lasts 4-6 years. All levels of schooling are free of charge.

The most important part of the system is the 8-year basic school. These schools generally have good educational facilities, and teachers must be graduates of higher education institutions. In a new residential area in the southern suburbs of Prague, Modřany, the reporter visited a newly built 8-year school. This is one of the most beautiful buildings in the area. The school has modern teaching facilities, including a reading room, study room, specialized classrooms, extracurricular activity rooms, laboratories, tiered lecture halls, two gymnasiums, two student cafeterias, as well as shower rooms and cloakrooms. Principal Čiča introduced that the 8-year school not only teaches book knowledge but also offers gardening, technology, and household labor as practical courses to cultivate students' practical abilities. From the 5th grade, students learn woodworking, metalworking, and basic electrical courses. Girls in the 7th grade learn cooking, and in the 8th grade, they learn sewing. Relevant officials believe that students should feel that studying at school is a pleasure, not a burden. Therefore, the teaching content should be simplified.

The news secretary of the Czech Republic's Ministry of Education, Youth, and Sports, Jeník, told the reporter in his office, which is much simpler than a classroom, that the 13th plenary session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia held in March discussed whether to establish a 10-year continuous education system. The current 10-year compulsory education is divided into two parts: the first 8 years for basic education, followed by 2-4 years in another school. To better connect the two parts, many people suggest changing to a 10-year continuous system. This way, after graduation, outstanding students can continue their studies, and average students can work as apprentices for 2 years before starting work. The Central Committee did not make a decision on this but proposed the task of discussing and formulating a new plan. Jeník believes that this method is feasible because students' academic performance will always vary. Schools should accommodate these differences, giving outstanding students the opportunity to further their studies and ensuring that average students acquire the necessary basic knowledge and skills. The important thing is to establish the idea that all kinds of work are important and that all kinds of people are needed.

Comrades from Czechoslovakia also pointed out that teachers' work should be highly respected, and their economic status should be improved. Currently, this aspect is not satisfactory in Czechoslovakia, and there is a phenomenon of low teacher salaries. A veteran teacher with 25 years of experience earns about 3000 koruna per month, while a young person working as a driver in a factory can earn 3000 koruna per month with just 6 years of work experience. Therefore, many people are reluctant to become teachers, and schools face a shortage of teachers. The 1976 educational program stipulates that to ensure teaching quality, each class in an 8-year school should have no more than 26 students, but due to the shortage of teachers, there are often 34-40 students in a class. Additionally, there is an issue with educational funding. This Central Committee meeting paid attention to this problem and proposed creating possibilities to increase educational funding when distributing national income.

    捷精益求精办教育
    本报记者　许宏治
    在布拉格的大街上，如果你用俄语、德语或者英语问路，对方往往能用同样的语言给你满意的答复。记者到工厂、机关、学校去采访，那里的负责人多半能用外语同你交谈。这从一个侧面反映出捷克斯洛伐克人的文化水准，也在一定程度上说明了捷克斯洛伐克41年来教育事业的成绩。
  按照1976年教改后建立的现行教育制度，全国3—6岁儿童都有条件上幼儿园，所有6岁儿童都可以进8年制基础学校，毕业后，必须进高一级学校至少学习2年。其中，约20％毕业生进4年制高级中学，毕业后一部分上大学，一部分参加工作。另有20％毕业生进4年制中等专业学校，包括幼儿师范等，毕业后参加工作，也可以考大学。其余60％毕业生上各种技工学校、徒工学校，学制分2、3、4年不等，毕业后即走上工作岗位。大学学制为4—6年。各级学校全部免费。
    最重要的是8年制基础学校。这里一般都有良好的教育设备，教师必须是高等学校毕业生。在布拉格南郊莫德拉尼的一个新建居民小区，记者参观了一所新建的8年制学校。这是附近一带最漂亮的建筑之一。学校拥有现代化的教学设施，楼内有阅览室、自习室、专业教室、课余活动室、实验室、阶梯大教室等，此外还有两个健身房、两个学生食堂以及淋浴室、衣帽间等。校长奇恰博士介绍说，8年制学校不仅讲授书本知识，而且开设园艺、技术、家务劳动三种实践课，以培养学生的实践能力。从5年级起，学生要学习木工、金属加工、电机基础等技术课，女生7年级学烹调，8年级学缝纫。有关人士认为，应该让学生感到在学校学习是一种乐趣，而不是一种负担。因此，教学内容应删繁就简。
    捷克共和国教育、青年、体育部新闻秘书耶尼克在他那间比教室简陋得多的办公室里告诉记者，今年3月召开的捷共中央第13次全会讨论了要不要设立10年一贯制学校的问题。现在的10年义务教育分成两段，前8年为基础教育，毕业后须升入另一所学校学习2—4年。为了衔接得更好，不少人建议改为10年一贯制。这样，毕业后，优秀学生继续升学，一般学生可当2年学徒后参加工作。中央全会并未就此作出决定，但提出了讨论、制定新方案的任务。耶尼克认为，这种办法是可取的，因为学生的学习成绩总是会有上中下的差别，学校要照顾这种差别，应使优秀学生有机会深造，一般学生也能学到必要的基础知识和技能。重要的是要树立一种观念：各种工作都重要，各种各样的人都需要。
    捷克斯洛伐克的同志还指出，教师的工作应该受到最大的尊敬，经济地位也应该提高。目前，捷在这方面尚不能尽如人意，还存在教师工资偏低的现象。有25年教龄的老教师月工资约3000克朗，而年青人在工厂当司机，只要有6年工龄，月工资就能达到3000克朗。因此，许多人不愿意当教师，学校里出现了师资不足的现象。1976年教育纲领规定，为了保证教学质量，8年制学校每个班最多只能有26名学生，但由于师资不足，现在往往一个班有34—40名学生。此外，还有一个教育经费问题。这次中央全会注意到了这个问题，提出在对国民收入进行分配时，要创造可能性，增加教育经费。
