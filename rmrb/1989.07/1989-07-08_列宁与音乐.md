Lenin's musical world was vast. He not only enjoyed proletarian revolutionary songs but also appreciated classical masterpieces.

In 1913, the Russian pianist Keldrov performed at a concert in Switzerland. After listening, Lenin praised his technique and said he would visit his residence to listen to music if he had the time. Keldrov thought this was just a polite remark, but later, Lenin actually came. The pianist found that Lenin was not interested in all works; he particularly liked Chopin's preludes, Schubert's "The Erlking," and Liszt's "Pastorale." He disliked shallow music that chased after superficial atmospheres. But whenever he heard Beethoven's music, he would light up. Lenin visited Keldrov's residence several times, and Keldrov, at Lenin's request, repeatedly played "Pathétique." When Keldrov performed, Lenin would sit back on the sofa, holding his breath, immersed in a profound musical realm that only he could feel.

During his exile, listening to music was an important spiritual respite for Lenin. But after seizing power, Lenin was busy with state affairs and had no leisure time to enjoy music, forcing himself to control his special affection for it with astonishing willpower. But whenever there was a performance of "Pathétique," he would try his best to attend. He once said, "I don't know if there is anything better than 'Pathétique.' I wish I could listen to it every day. It is exquisite and unparalleled music."

    列宁与音乐
    列宁的音乐世界很广阔，不仅喜欢无产阶级的战斗歌曲，也很欣赏古典名曲。
    1913年，俄国钢琴家凯德洛夫曾在瑞士的一个音乐会上演出，列宁听后称赞他的演技，并说有空就去他寓所听音乐。凯德洛夫原以为这只是一般的客气话，没想到后来列宁真来了。钢琴家发现，列宁不是对所有的作品都感兴趣，他特别喜欢肖邦的前奏曲、舒伯特的《林中之王》和李斯特的《安宁》，不喜欢那些追求表面气氛的肤浅音乐。但他一听到贝多芬的音乐，就容光焕发。列宁到凯德洛夫寓所去过几次，凯德洛夫应列宁的要求反复地弹奏《热情奏鸣曲》。当凯德洛夫演奏时，列宁屏息静气地仰靠在沙发上，沉浸在一种深邃的、只有他一个人才能感受到的音乐境界中。
    在流亡中，听音乐是列宁很重要的精神上的休息。但在夺取政权之后，列宁日理万机，没有空闲去欣赏音乐了，只好以惊人的控制力，克制着自己对音乐的特殊感情。但每当有《热情奏鸣曲》演出时，他还是尽可能去的。他曾这样赞道：“我不知道还有比《热情奏鸣曲》更好的东西，我愿每天都听一听，这是绝妙的、人间所没有的音乐。”
