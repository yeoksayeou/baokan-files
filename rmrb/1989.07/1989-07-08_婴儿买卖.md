In southern Italy, the trafficking of infants is rampant. Both domestic and foreign individuals have flocked to this region to purchase infants from the black market, only to sell them elsewhere. It is said that a newborn baby, just a few hours old, can fetch a price of over $10,000 on the black market.

Officials in Naples report that hundreds of cases of illegal infant trafficking occur in the city each year. Many infants are sold without anyone noticing, and this phenomenon is difficult to control. Currently, Naples has effectively become the center for infant trafficking in Italy. The president of the juvenile court in Campania, Judge Ciampa, stated that in the southern Italian region of Campania alone, at least 600 infants are trafficked each year. Most of the mothers who sell their infants are unmarried teenagers. After becoming pregnant, they secretly travel to the south to give birth. Many of these teenage pregnancies occur under abnormal circumstances. After giving birth, these girls often abandon their infants in hospitals. Some doctors and nurses in this region are involved in the trafficking of infants, acting as intermediaries to sell newborns to traffickers, who then take them to the black market for sale. Some hospital staff maintain lists of people who want to buy infants, and as soon as a teenager gives birth, within a few hours, someone claiming to be the father will take the infant away and buy it.

The increase in infant trafficking reflects, to some extent, the serious social problems in Italy.

    “婴儿买卖”
    意大利南部地区贩卖婴儿活动十分猖獗，国内外靠贩卖婴儿而发财的人都纷纷涌到这里，在黑市市场上物色婴儿，然后再贩卖出去。据说，现在一个刚从医院里才出世几小时的婴儿，在黑市场上的售价上万美元。
    那不勒斯市的官员说，在那不勒斯市每年都要发生几百起非法转卖婴儿的案件。许多婴儿在无法觉察的情况下被倒卖，而且这种现象根本无法控制。眼下，那不勒斯市实际上已成为意大利贩卖婴儿的交易中心。该市青少年法院院长钱帕说：仅在意大利南部坎伯尼亚一个地区，每年至少有六百个婴儿被人贩卖。出卖婴儿的母亲多半是未婚少女，她们怀孕之后私自偷偷跑到南部地区，在那里生下自己的孩子。这众多的未婚怀孕少女，多数是在发生不正常情况时怀孕的。她们在那里生下孩子后往往将孩子遗弃在医院里，而这个地区的有些医生、护士正是贩卖婴儿的中间人，由他们联系，把新生儿卖给人贩子，然后再由他们带到黑市市场上将其出售。有的医院工作人员手里握有一批想买婴儿者的名单，待等一名少女生下孩子，不到几小时，就有一个人自称是孩子的父亲，将婴儿冒领买走了。
    贩卖婴儿增多的现象正从一个侧面反映出意大利社会问题的严重性。
