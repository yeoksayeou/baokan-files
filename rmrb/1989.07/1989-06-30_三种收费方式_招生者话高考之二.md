The college entrance examination on the Chinese mainland has long been called the "single plank bridge" for high school students. In the past, to cross this "single plank bridge," one only needed to study hard. Once admitted, everything was arranged by the state. This year, however, the newly enrolled students are different from before. They can be roughly divided into three categories: state-planned, directed training, and self-funded students. Therefore, in addition to studying hard, students should also discuss with their parents: based on their own conditions, which type of enrollment is best.

Wang Chichang, Director of the Higher Education Student Affairs Office of the State Education Commission, told the reporter that in March, the State Council approved the reform plan for the employment system of college graduates. It was proposed that students who apply for state-planned quotas will have their tuition fees covered by the state, and students will pay miscellaneous fees; students who apply for directed enrollment quotas will have directed scholarships set up by the relevant industries and regions, and students will be exempt from paying miscellaneous fees; self-funded students will pay tuition and miscellaneous fees according to the regulations of the schools they apply to. Therefore, it should be made clear to society that paying fees does not mean being self-funded.

Self-Funded Students: Still in the Experimental Stage

Currently, there is a high demand for self-funded students in various regions. The number of self-funded students enrolled has been increasing rapidly, with 10,600 students enrolled nationwide in 1987 and 48,000 in 1988. That year, 82,800 students applied, with an admission rate of 57.9%. Sichuan Province enrolled the most, with over 5,400 students. However, the enrollment of self-funded students is still in the experimental stage. From the students' perspective, there are three main characteristics: first, there are more children of intellectuals and cadres, accounting for 70% in Beijing in 1988, with the remaining 30% being children of workers and individual business owners; second, there is a particular emphasis on the major, which is considered for future employment and to achieve "investment returns"; third, they study more diligently and do not waste time. From the schools' perspective, two problems have emerged: first, it is difficult to handle the students' household registration, which needs to be decided by each province, autonomous region, and municipality directly under the Central Government. Those who cannot be transferred become a burden on the school for grain and oil supply and subsidiary subsidies; second, the admission score lines are uneven, with the State Education Commission stipulating that for the same type of major, self-funded students can have a maximum reduction of 30 points. Last year, the minimum reduction was 20 points, and the maximum was 60 points, leading to societal discussions about "making up for insufficient scores with money" and "unequal competition."

When applying for self-funded students, students and parents are first concerned about the amount of fees. Last year, the average annual tuition for undergraduate self-funded students was 1,600 yuan, which is lower than the average cost of cultivating a college student. This year, the State Education Commission has made regulations that the annual tuition for undergraduate and junior college students in science, arts, and sports should not be less than 2,000 yuan per person, and for liberal arts, it should not be less than 1,700 yuan. This refers to the tuition fees, and additional accommodation fees, miscellaneous fees, and medical fees are also required.

To avoid chaos and unequal competition in the enrollment process, the State Education Commission has summarized the experiences of the past two years and made other regulations for the enrollment of self-funded students, such as: the enrollment of self-funded students by colleges and universities in various regions and departments should be controlled at 5% of the total enrollment, and auditing students, transfer students, and "children's classes" should not be enrolled under the name of self-funded students; the enrollment line for self-funded students should not be lower than the national enrollment control line for the same batch by 20 points. If the school cannot enroll students at the enrollment line, it should reduce the enrollment plan; self-funded students who are not admitted by the local enrollment office cannot obtain formal student status, and the state does not recognize their academic qualifications; students can participate in the evaluation of excellent student scholarships, etc.

This year, a total of 640,000 students will be enrolled in ordinary higher education institutions nationwide. If self-funded students are enrolled at a rate of 5%, the total number will be approximately 32,000, which is a decrease from last year.

Directed Students: Declining Enrollment

Considering the imbalance between regions and industries, to solve the needs of some remote areas and industries with harsh working and living conditions, as well as key units, the state has arranged a certain proportion in the national enrollment plan to implement directed enrollment and directed employment. In 1987, a total of 59,000 such students were enrolled nationwide, and in 1988, 91,700 were enrolled. This year, according to the feedback from local enrollment offices, the enrollment of this type of student shows a significant downward trend. Some universities in the interior have plans to enroll directed students from Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and other border regions this year, but these regions need to bear the directed scholarships. The heads of the "enrollment offices" in these regions expressed that, considering the difficulties in funding and distribution work, they cannot afford this scholarship. If the relevant schools are willing, they can solve the funding themselves to enroll students; if not, they have no objection. It seems that with the deepening of the reform, the number of directed enrollments will gradually decrease.

The quality of enrollment in normal and other professional colleges has declined, and the quantity is difficult to guarantee. In recent years, society has issued many calls for this.

Commissioned training is also facing difficulties. The personnel in charge of enrollment at the Petrochemical Corporation introduced that in previous years, the corporation had signed 20-year contracts with 13 colleges and universities to commission them to cultivate 1,500 to 2,000 students each year, which was quite ambitious. However, due to the difficulty in cultivating according to the needs of the profession, some intentions could not be realized. The enterprise also implemented the total wage control, and there were difficulties in the distribution of graduates.

Looking at the national situation, a total of 63,100 commissioned training students were enrolled last year, and this year's plan is for 56,000. A large part of this number is the training quota reported by enterprise units to solve the employment of children of workers. Now that university graduates can all be obtained and distributed, if there is no pressure to employ children of workers, an enterprise often lacks the initiative to commission universities to cultivate talents.

State-Funded Training: Most Schools Do Not Charge Fees for the Time Being

From the enrollment plan, the majority of this year's examinees will still be in the category where the state provides the training fees, with approximately 550,000 students to be enrolled. The difference from previous years is that the 36 colleges and universities under the State Education Commission (including 6 normal colleges and universities that still do not charge fees) will charge tuition and miscellaneous fees of 50 to 150 yuan per semester. After graduation, students will mainly not find jobs on their own but will be recommended for employment by the school as an intermediary to society, with a certain range of two-way selection. For a small number of graduates who are not recruited after being recommended, they will find jobs on their own. To solve the possible unemployment of a small number of graduates, the State Education Commission is coordinating with relevant departments to formulate regulations for social insurance during the unemployment period of graduates.

For the more than 1,000 colleges and universities managed by departments and local governments, according to the reporter's understanding, except for a few colleges and universities that implement new charging methods this year, most colleges and universities do not charge fees for students enrolled under the national quota.

    三种收费方式
    ——招生者话高考之二
    本报记者　周庆
    中国大陆的高考，一直被称为高中生的“独木桥”，往年要过
  “独木桥”，拚命学习即可，只要考上了，都是国家分配。今年，新招收的学生与以前有所不同，大致可分为国家分配、定向培养和自费生三种，所以考生在刻苦学习之余，还要和家长仔细商量：据自己的条件究竟报考哪一种好。
    国家教委高校学生司司长王炽昌告诉记者，今年3月国务院批准的高等学校毕业生分配制度改革方案提出，报考国家任务名额的学生，培养费由国家提供，学生交纳学杂费；报考定向招生名额的学生，由定向行业、地区设立定向奖学金，学生免交学杂费；自费生则按所报考学校的规定交纳培养费与学杂费，所以要告诉社会：收费不等于自费。自费生：
    仍在试验阶段
    目前各地区招收自费生的呼声很高。自费生招生数也增长较快，全国1987年招生1.06万名，1988年招生4.8万名，这一年报名者有8.28万名，录取比例为57.9％，其中四川省招生最多，为5400多名。但招收自费生目前仍处于试验阶段，从学生方面看，特点有三个：一是知识分子、干部子女多，1988年在北京市占到70％，其余30％是工人、个体户子女；二是特别重视专业，这是为今后就业和换取“投资效益”着想的；三是学习较刻苦，舍不得浪费光阴。从学校看，出现的毛病有两个：一是学生户口难办，要由各省、自治区、直辖市决定是否转入学校，凡转不去的，粮油供应、副食补贴成为学校负担；二是录取分数线高低不等，国家教委规定，报考同类专业，自费生最多只能降30分，去年降分最少的20分，最多的60分，致使社会上有“分不够、钱来凑”和“不平等竞争”的议论。
    报考自费生，学生和家长首先关心的是收费数额。去年本科自费生年平均收费1600元，低于国家培养一个大学生的平均费用。今年，国家教委对此作出规定，本、专科中理科类、艺术类、体育类每人每年不低于2000元，文科类不低于1700元，这是指培养费，另外，尚须交纳住宿费、杂费、医药费。
    为避免招生工作中的混乱和不平等竞争，国家教委总结前两年的经验，对招收自费生还作出一些其它规定，如各地区、各部门的高等学校招收自费生按招生总数的5％掌握，不得以自费名义招收本专科学历层次的旁听生、插班生、“子弟班”；自费生报名线不能低于同批国家任务招生调档控制线20分，学校在报名线上录取不到学生，要减少招生计划；未经各地招生办公室录取的自费生不能取得正式学籍，国家不承认其学历；学生可以参加优秀学生奖学金的评定等。
    今年全国普通高等院校共招生64万名，如果自费生按5％的比例招收，总数约占3.2万名，比去年有所下降。定向生：
    生源呈下降趋势
    国家考虑到地区、行业的不平衡性，为解决某些边远地区和工作、生活条件较艰苦的行业及重点单位的需要，在国家任务招生中安排一定比例，实行定向招生、定向就业。1987年，全国招收此类学生5.9万名，1988年，招收9.17万名。今年，据各地招生办公室反映，此类学生的生源呈明显下降趋势。内地一些大学今年都有从新疆、内蒙古等边疆地区招收定向生的计划指标，但需这些地区负担定向奖学金。这些地区“招生办”负责人表示，鉴于经费和分配工作中的困难，他们不能支付这笔奖学金，有关学校如愿意，可自己解决经费招生，不招我们也没意见。看来，随着改革的深化，定向招生的数量将逐步减少。
    师范等专业类院校招生质量下降，数量难以保证，这几年社会上已发出不少呼吁。
    委托培养目前也面临困难。石化总公司招生工作人员介绍，前几年，该公司曾和13所院校签订20年合同，委托学校每年为他们培养1500到2000名学生，气魄不可谓不大。但由于培养难以按需要的专业对口，有些意图实现不了，企业又实行了工资总额包干，毕业生分配也存在困难。
    进而从全国的情况来看，去年一共招收委托培养学生6.31万人，今年计划指标为5.6万人。这个数字中，很大成份是企业单位为解决职工子女就业而申报的培养数。现在大学毕业生都要得到、分得来，如无职工子女就业的压力，一个企业往往就没有委托大学培养人才的积极性。
    国家培养：
    多数院校暂不收费
    从招生计划看，今年考生报考的大头，仍是国家出培养费的这一块，约招生55万名。与往年不同的是，国家教委所属36所高等院校
  （其中6所师范院校仍不收费）每学期要收学杂费50到150元。毕业后，学生主要还不是靠自己找职业，而是以学校为中介向社会推荐就业，在一定范围内双向选择。对经推荐未被录用的少数毕业生，则由本人自谋职业。为解决少数毕业生可能出现的待业现象，国家教委正协同有关部门研究制定毕业生待业期间社会保险等规定。
    对于由部门、地方管理的1000多所高等院校，据记者了解，今年除个别院校实施新的收费方式外，大多数院校在国家任务名额内招收的学生都暂不收费。
