The practice of turning large-scale meetings and inspections into extravagant feasts has been effectively curbed in Linxiang County. This result comes after the county's Party Committee and government established a meeting tracking and supervision system.

This year, the county's Party Committee and government have prioritized clean governance as a key aspect of ideological and political work, focusing on the smallest details. In the past, whenever the county's Party Committee and government organized large-scale inspections or held major meetings, they would set high living standards, with the excess costs covered by the county's finances. To address this issue, the county's Party Committee and government decided to establish a meeting tracking and supervision system this year. The system stipulates that during large-scale inspections and meetings, the discipline inspection and supervision departments will track and supervise all expenses. Detailed expense lists must be submitted to the tracking supervisors for review. Only after confirmation that the expenses do not exceed the standard and the supervisors have signed off, can the expenses be reimbursed. If the expenses exceed the standard, 70% of the organizer's monthly salary and 30% of the handler's monthly salary will be deducted; in serious cases, disciplinary actions or public criticism will be taken.

After the establishment of the meeting tracking and supervision system, various departments under the county government also took corresponding measures. In the first half of this year, the county's Party Committee, government, and various departments under the county government held various meetings and conducted production inspections, with a total expenditure of 147,000 yuan, a reduction of 246,000 yuan compared to the same period last year.

    临湘县防止会议大吃大喝有新招
    建立开支跟踪监督制度
    把大型会议和大型检查活动变成大型吃喝玩乐的不正之风，在我县已经基本刹住。这是县委、县政府建立会议跟踪监督制度后出现的结果。
    今年以来，我县县委和县政府把廉政建设作为思想政治工作的头等大事，从一点一滴做起。往年，县委、县政府每次举行全县性大检查活动或召开大型会议时，总要把生活标准定得高一些，超预算部分由县财政补贴。针对这种情况，县委、县政府今年研究决定，建立会议跟踪监督制度。制度规定：举行大型检查和会议时，纪检、监察部门跟踪监督。一切开支必须先列出明细表，交给跟踪监督员审核，经确认无超标准后，由监督员签字划押方可报帐。如超标准，扣罚主持人当月工资70％，扣罚经办人当月工资30％；情节严重的，给予党纪、政纪处分或通报批评。
    会议跟踪监督制度设立后，县直各部门也纷纷采取了相应的措施。今年上半年，县委、县政府和县直各部门召开各种会议和举行生产检查等活动共开支14.7万元，比去年同期减少24.6％。　湖南临湘县
