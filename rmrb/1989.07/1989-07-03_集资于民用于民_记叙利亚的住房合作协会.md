    Raising Funds from the People and Using Them for the People
    – A Report on Syria's Housing Cooperatives
    By People's Daily reporter Wú Wénbīn

    After several years, the reporter returned to Syria and found that the country had undergone significant changes in various aspects. The most striking impression was the newly constructed residential buildings in major cities. Therefore, the reporter specially investigated the housing situation in Syria.

    The Syrian Population Association recently published a report indicating that Syria's population growth rate is 33.6‰. In 1986, the national population was 10.612 million, and it is expected to reach 12.5 million next year and 17 million by the year 2000. In 1987, there were a total of 1.765 million households and 1.787 million housing units nationwide. Judging by these statistics, Syria's housing situation seems to be manageable. In reality, due to the large influx of rural population into cities, the urban housing shortage problem is becoming increasingly severe.

    To address this issue, the Syrian government established the Ministry of Housing and the Real Estate Bank. In housing construction, the policy of "raising funds from the people and using them for the people" was adopted, allowing state-owned enterprises, private individuals, and cooperatives to play their respective roles. Currently, in newly constructed housing, private and cooperative-built housing accounts for 3/4 of the total. According to a colleague, over the past 20 years, the government has channeled scattered private funds through housing cooperatives, provided land, steel, cement, and other building materials at preferential prices, and offered loans to encourage the construction of residential buildings. This approach not only reduces the fiscal burden on the state but also solves the public's housing problems, and is considered a successful experience.

    Syria's housing cooperatives were established in the 1970s and are organized by departments and industries. Currently, there are 985 cooperatives nationwide, which built a total of 64,214 housing units during the period from 1981 to 1985.

    The establishment of housing cooperatives requires approval from the Ministry of Housing. The constitutions of various cooperatives are generally similar. Anyone who wishes to join the cooperative and apply for housing must register in the order of registration time, and the list of members is posted on the walls of the cooperative for public supervision.

    A friend named Abu Samir told the reporter that in 1972, he registered and applied for a housing unit in the Engineers' Housing Cooperative. At that time, he paid a deposit of 5,000 Syrian pounds (1 US dollar equals 9.3 Syrian pounds) and then paid 200 Syrian pounds monthly. The amount of the advance payment is determined by the size of the applied housing area. In 1978, he selected the floor and location on the blueprint at the housing cooperative and signed his name, securing the housing. Later, due to special circumstances, he paid additional deposits. By 1979, when the housing was completed, Abu Samir received a fully equipped three-bedroom apartment with a total area of 140 square meters, priced at 200,000 Syrian pounds. According to regulations, before moving into the new residence, he must pay 50% of the housing cost, which is 100,000 Syrian pounds. However, this amount can be applied for a loan from the Real Estate Bank. Subsequently, 800 Syrian pounds are deducted from his salary each month to repay the loan over 25 years, which can be shortened or extended depending on his economic situation. However, before the bank loan is fully repaid, the property rights of the house still belong to the housing cooperative.

    Syria's housing cooperatives play an important role in solving the public's housing problems and are widely welcomed.

### 集资于民用于民——记叙利亚的住房合作协会

    集资于民用于民
    ——记叙利亚的住房合作协会
    本报记者　吴文斌
    时隔数年，记者再次来到叙利亚时，发现它在各方面都有明显变化。印象最深的是，各大城市都有拔地而起的崭新的住宅楼。因此，记者特地采访了叙利亚的住宅情况。
    叙利亚人口协会在不久前发表的报告中指出，叙人口的增长率为33.6‰，1986年全国人口为1061.2万，明年将达到1250万，2000年预计达1700万。1987年，全国总共有176.5万个家庭，178.7万套住房。单看这个统计数字，叙的住房似乎是不成问题的。实际上，由于农村人口大量流入城市，城市的住房短缺问题正在日益严重。
    为解决这个问题，叙利亚政府专门设立了住房部和房地产银行。在住房建设中采取了“集资于民用于民”的方针，让国营部门、私人、合作协会三者都能发挥应有的作用。目前在新建的住房面积中，私人与合作协会营建的占了3／4。据一位同行介绍，近20年来，政府通过住房合作协会的途径，把分散的民间资金集中起来，同时按优惠价向协会提供地皮、钢材、水泥等建筑材料和贷款，鼓励它兴建住宅。这样既减轻了国家的财政负担，又解决了公众的住房问题，被认为是一条成功的经验。
    叙利亚住房合作协会创建于70年代，按部门和行业组织。目前，全国已建立了985个协会，在1981—1985年期间共建房64214套。
    住房合作协会的组建，需经住房部审批。各个协会的章程大体相同，凡愿参加协会申请住房者，均按注册登记的时间顺序排队，会员的名单全部张贴在协会的墙上，以便大家监督。
    一位叫阿布·萨米尔的朋友对记者说，1972年他在工程师住房合作协会注册申请了一套住房。当时他交了5000叙镑（1美元等于9.3叙镑）的预订金，而后，每月预付200叙镑。预付金额按申请住宅面积的大小而定。1978年，他到住房协会在图纸上挑选楼层和位置，并签了字，房子就算有了着落。后来，因特殊情况他又增缴了预订金。到1979年住房完工，阿布·萨米尔领到了一套3室1厅、设备齐全的住宅，总面积140平米，房价为20万叙镑。按规定，他在搬入新居前，必须交纳50％的房钱，即10万叙镑。不过，这笔款可向房地产银行申请贷款。以后，每月从他的工资中扣还800叙镑，25年还清，亦可视经济状况缩短或延长。但是，在银行贷款全部偿还前，房子产权仍归住房合作协会所有。
    叙利亚的住房合作协会在解决公众的住宅问题上发挥着重要作用，受到普遍的欢迎。（附图片）
