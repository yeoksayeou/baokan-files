The book "Strengthening the Party's Ideological Work During Reform and Opening Up" is soon to be published by the Central Party School Press and the Seeking Truth Press. This book, based on the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the practical experience of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots, takes the Party's basic line and Deng Xiaoping's statements on Party building in the new era, adherence to the four cardinal principles, and opposition to bourgeois liberalization as its guiding principles. It closely ties in with the actual situation of the Party's ideological and theoretical construction over the past decade, deeply expounds on the important significance, guiding ideology, principles to follow, and main content of Party ideological and theoretical construction in the new situation of reform and opening up. It clearly proposes the direction for the Party's ideological and theoretical construction to adhere to, improve, and develop.
