	Can Such Spiritual Nourishment Be Provided?
	People's Liberation Army Unit 58072, Liu Kunming, People's Daily:

	After several days of interviews, I have completed this report. I hope to use a corner of the People's Daily to remind people and relevant departments that the "scourge" of street bookstalls in Beijing and across the country must be stopped.

	In recent years, street bookstalls in Beijing have become increasingly popular. To attract readers, almost every bookstall hangs up one or two signs with provocative text.

	Near Fuchengmen, one bookstall's advertisement exaggerates the obscene content of a work and concludes: "The entire work is gripping, providing a strong shock to both the senses and the soul!" Not far away, another bookstall's advertisement begins with four large characters: "First Look!" The content summary reads: "Father and son share a bed with a woman, father and daughter-in-law, son and father's mistress, men mutually devouring women's bodies..." Such advertisements are common on bookstalls, and some, fearing they lack appeal, add a final sentence: "Please read critically" or "Not suitable for minors."

	The stall owners occupy prime locations such as subway stations, bus stops, bustling intersections, and shop entrances. Crowds always gather in front of the bookstalls.

	Upon approaching the bookstalls, one's eyes are met with the colorful covers of various books and magazines. Most of them feature half-naked or fully naked men and women, with women being the majority. The book titles are filled with phrases like "Yellow Army of Women," "Wolves and Harlots," "Women's Auction Market," and "Night Talks on Sex Life." Flipping through the table of contents, almost all of them are the epitome of obscenity. A recent issue of the magazine "Green Fields" includes: "Behind the Scenes of Nude Beauty," "Encounters," "School of the Flesh," and so on. The book introductions further emphasize and highlight the content. After visiting about a dozen bookstalls, I estimated that this type of obscene book accounts for approximately two-thirds of the books on the stalls.

	The stall owners are mostly young people, occasionally with some elderly men and women. Judging by their appearance, their educational level does not seem high, but their understanding of reader psychology is truly impressive. Apart from recognizing that pornography is the "eternal protagonist" of bookstalls, there is also a "supporting protagonist" for each period.

	I believe that these obscene books on the stalls should be completely eradicated, not just treated like before, like cutting leeks, cutting one batch and another growing back.

### 能提供这样的精神食粮吗？

    能提供这样的精神食粮吗？
    解放军58072部队　刘昆明人民日报：
    经过几天的采访后，我写成了这篇报道，想占用人民日报一角提醒人们和有关部门，北京乃至全国街头书摊上的“祸水”不能再继续泛滥下去了。
    这几年，北京街头书摊日趋兴隆起来。为了招徕读者，几乎每个书摊都挂起了一两块文字撩拨人心的广告牌子。
    阜成门附近的一个书摊广告，把一部作品淫秽内容渲染了一番后，这样结尾：“整部作品扣人心弦，不论从感官上还是心灵上都能给人以强烈的震撼！”不远处的另一书摊广告，开头四个大字：先睹为快！内容提要写着：“父与子同享一女床笫之欢，父与儿媳，儿与父情妇，男人互相强食女人肉体……”
    这样的广告在书摊上比比皆是，有的还怕吸引力不够，最后再加上一句：“请批判阅读”或“未成年者不宜阅读。”
    摊主们占据地铁、电汽车站、繁华的十字路口、商店门口等“宝地”，书摊前总能人头攒动。
    挤到书摊前，映入眼帘的总是各种书刊花花绿绿的封面。大都是半裸或全裸的男人女人，其中以女人居多。书刊的名字也离不开什么“黄色娘子军”、“色狼与荡妇”、“女人拍卖市场”“性生活夜话”之类。随手翻翻目录，几乎都是集淫秽之大成，一本近期的《绿野》杂志，目录是：“美女裸体画内幕”、“艳遇”、“肉体学校”等等，书刊的内容介绍更极尽渲染突出之能事。走了十几个书摊，估计了一下，这类淫秽书刊在书摊上大约占2／3。
    书摊主大都是些年轻人，间或也有些老头老太太，看上去他们文化程度都不会很高，但其对读者心理学之谙熟，实在令人叹服。他们除了认定色情是书摊的“永恒主角”外，一个时期还有一个时期的“副主角”。
    我认为书摊上的黄色书刊应根本扫除，不要像以前治来治去，像割韭菜那样，割了一茬，又长出了一茬。
