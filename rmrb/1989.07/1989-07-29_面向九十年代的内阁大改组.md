The cabinet reshuffle announced by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on July 25th is the most significant personnel change in the UK in 30 years. The British refer to the 1962 reshuffle by Prime Minister Macmillan as the "Night of the Long Knives," and this reshuffle is dubbed the "Day of the Quick Knives." Indeed, the reshuffle was swift and decisive, catching many by surprise. Out of the 21 cabinet members, only 8, including Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, remained in their posts. Two ministers were dismissed, two resigned, nine changed positions, and four new members were promoted to the cabinet. The most surprising move was the appointment of 46-year-old John Major as the new Foreign Secretary, while the former Foreign Secretary, Geoffrey Howe, was appointed Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons. Including non-cabinet senior government officials, the turnover rate is over 50%.

This reshuffle, which has shaken the British political landscape, aims to counter the rising challenge from the Labour Party and prepare the Conservative Party for victory in the 1992 general election. It is seen as a major overhaul for the 1990s. On July 27th, at the first meeting of the new cabinet, Thatcher reiterated her intention to build a "cabinet ready for the next election battle" and stated that she has no plans for another major reshuffle before the next election.

Since the Conservative Party's victory in the June 1987 general election, securing a third consecutive term, two years have passed. The mid-term government now faces new challenges and tasks in economics, domestic affairs, and foreign policy. The ability to address these challenges and solve these issues will be crucial to the outcome of the next election.

Economically, Thatcher's success has been a key factor in her "three consecutive terms" and is the main reason for the "Thatcherism" label. The success or failure of the next election will still depend on economic policies. However, the Conservative government has been plagued by inflation, high-interest rates, and a large trade deficit for over a year, drawing criticism from the public and business community. Despite speculation in the media that Chancellor Nigel Lawson might be dismissed, Thatcher decided to keep him in his post. It is believed that the reason for his retention is his insistence on anti-inflation measures, which have shown initial results. Lawson has stated that he aims to reduce the inflation rate to around 6% by the end of this year.

In terms of domestic affairs, the Conservative government has focused on education, healthcare, taxation, and social welfare reforms over the past two years. However, these areas are closely related to people's lives and can easily provoke dissatisfaction. Reports indicate that the public is skeptical about the feasibility and effectiveness of the poll tax and water privatization plans, and they are not very receptive to reforms in the National Health Service. However, these reforms were promises made during the last election, and their success or failure will also affect the Conservative Party's chances in the next election. Therefore, Thatcher decided to appoint the party's "rising star," Patrick Mayhew, as the new Environment Secretary to handle the thorny issues related to water and the poll tax. The 45-year-old Mayhew previously served as the non-cabinet Minister for Overseas Development and has experience as the head of the Conservative Party's research department, often drafting speeches for Thatcher. He is seen as a capable problem solver for the Conservative Party.

In terms of foreign affairs, one of the main reasons for Thatcher's "three consecutive terms" is her success in establishing Britain's diplomatic image. Over the past year, with the easing of East-West relations, Britain's role in this area is also changing. In the coming years, as a member of the European Community, Britain will face significant foreign policy challenges related to European integration. However, Thatcher's European policy differs from that of most European Community countries. Overcoming these differences, successfully managing Britain's cooperation with its European partners, and contributing to European unity and prosperity will undoubtedly strengthen Britain's international image. Therefore, Thatcher notably appointed John Major, who has insights into European issues, as the new Foreign Secretary. Major previously served as the second-in-command at the Treasury and has the ability to handle various frictions. In the 1990s, the issue of a unified market may bring new economic contradictions within the European Community, so Thatcher chose John Major, who understands economics, although he lacks diplomatic experience.

Additionally, in terms of party affairs, this reshuffle saw the appointment of Education Secretary Kenneth Baker as the new Conservative Party Chairman, and the former Trade and Industry Secretary, Lord Young, as the Deputy Chairman. Local analysts believe that this is a clear indication of preparations for the next election.

However, some local newspapers have different views on Thatcher's sweeping reshuffle, particularly the replacement of the experienced "hero" Geoffrey Howe. The general consensus, however, is that this reshuffle will "sharpen the government's edge" and may inject new vitality into the government.

### 面向九十年代的内阁大改组

    面向九十年代的内阁大改组
    本报记者　陈特安
    英国首相撒切尔夫人25日宣布的内阁改组是英国30年来人事变动最大的一次改组。英国人称1962年麦克米伦首相的大改组为“长刀之夜”，也称这次大改组为“快刀之日”。的确，改组犹如快刀斩麻，干脆利落，出人所料。在内阁21名阁员中，只有财政大臣劳森等8人留任，2名大臣去职，2名辞职，9名变动职位，4名新人晋升内阁。最令人意外的是，起用46岁的约翰·梅杰出任外交大臣，而原外交大臣杰弗里·豪则出任副首相兼下院保守党领袖。如果连同非内阁政府高级官员在内，变动幅度在50％以上。
    这次震动英国政坛的改组旨在对付力量正在上升的工党的挑战，为保守党在1992年下届大选获胜作准备，被认为是一次面向90年代的大改组。撒切尔夫人在27日新内阁第一次会议上重申，她想建立的是一个“为下届大选战斗”的内阁，并表示在下届大选前，无意再对内阁作重大改组。
    保守党政府自1987年6月大选获胜三连任以来，两年过去了，执政中期在经济、内政和外交等方面都面临新挑战和新课题，能否对付这些挑战，解决这些课题，正是下届大选成败的关键。
    从经济方面看，经济上的成功是撒切尔夫人能“三连任”的本钱，也是人们在“撒切尔”之后加上“主义”桂冠的主要原因。下届大选的成败，关键仍在经济政策的成败。但保守党政府一年多来一直受到通货膨胀、高利率、巨额贸易赤字的困扰，公众及企业界对此不无怨言。在这种情况下，尽管此间舆论界早有猜测，认为财政大臣劳森可能去职，但撒切尔夫人却让劳森留任。据认为，留任的原因是劳森坚持反通货膨胀措施，并已初见成效。劳森表示今年年底要使通货膨胀率回降到6％左右。
    从内政方面看，保守党政府两年来着力在教育、医疗卫生、税制和社会福利等方面推行一系列改革，但这些领域均与人民生活密切相关，容易引起不满。据报道，公众对人头税制和水私有化计划的可行性和效果有怀疑，对国民卫生服务方面的改革也不甚欢迎。但这些改革都是保守党上次竞选许下的诺言，它们的成败也关系到保守党在下届大选的胜负。为此撒切尔夫人决定起用党内“新秀”帕滕出任环境大臣，主管水务、人头税制等与环境有关的棘手问题。45岁的帕滕原任海外发展总署非内阁大臣，任过保守党研究部主任，常为撒切尔夫人起草会议演讲稿，被认为是一位能为保守党解难排忧的干才。
    从外交方面看，玛·撒切尔政府之所以能“三连任”，又一个最重要的原因就是成功地树立了英国的外交形象。
    近一年多，随着东西方关系的缓和，英国在这方面所起的微妙作用的份量也正在发生变化。今后几年，作为欧共体成员国的英国，欧洲一体化问题将是英国面临的重大外交课题。然而撒切尔夫人的欧洲政策与欧洲共同体多数国家存在分歧。克服这些分歧、成功地处理英国与其欧洲伙伴的合作关系，为欧洲联合与繁荣贡献力量，无疑有利于进一步加强英国的国际形象，因此，撒切尔夫人此次引人注目地起用了对欧洲问题颇有见解的约翰·梅杰出任外交大臣。梅杰原是财政部第二把手，有处理各种摩擦的才干，在90年代，统一大市场问题可能会引起欧共体内部各种新的经济矛盾，所以，撒切尔夫人选择了约翰·梅杰这样懂经济的新人，虽然他缺乏外交经历。
    此外，从党务方面看，在这次改组中，安排教育大臣贝克出任保守党主席，原贸工大臣扬勋爵任副主席。此间分析家认为，这已是明显地摆出了准备下届大选的强大阵势。
    不过，此间一些报刊对撒切尔夫人大刀阔斧的改组，尤其是换下有多年外交经验的“功臣”杰弗里·豪也有不同看法。但比较普遍的看法是，这次改组将“磨利政府的锋刃”，有可能为政府注进新的活力。
