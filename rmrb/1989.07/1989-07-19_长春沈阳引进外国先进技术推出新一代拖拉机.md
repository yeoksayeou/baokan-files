Changchun and Shenyang Introduce New Generation of Tractors with Advanced Foreign Technology

    Changchun and Shenyang Tractor Factories have recently developed 56-horsepower medium-sized and 160-horsepower large-sized wheeled tractors. This marks China's ability to produce large and medium-sized wheeled tractors with advanced technology from the early 1980s.

    These two types of tractors were produced by China's agricultural machinery sector using technology imported from the American John Deere Company. On July 10 and 13, the first phase of construction and technological renovation for this import project at the Shenyang and Changchun Tractor Factories were completed and passed the acceptance inspection.

    长春沈阳引进外国先进技术推出新一代拖拉机
    本报讯　长春、沈阳拖拉机厂最近试制出56马力中型和160马力大型轮式拖拉机，这标志着我国已能够生产具有国外80年代初期先进技术水平的大中型轮式拖拉机。
    这两种拖拉机是我国农机部门依靠从美国约翰·迪尔公司引进的技术生产的。在今年7月10日和13日，沈阳、长春拖拉机厂这项引进项目的第一期基本建设和技术改造工作，分别通过了竣工验收。　（姚监复）
