From July 5th to 15th, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto conducted a 10-day official visit to the UK and France. This visit was another successful diplomatic endeavor following her pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, official visit to China, attendance at the Japanese Emperor's funeral, and visits to Turkey and the United States this year.

During her visit to the UK, Benazir Bhutto held two rounds of talks with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Accompanying officials, including the Foreign Minister and the Minister of Industry, also held corresponding talks with British officials. Benazir Bhutto's visit to the UK achieved three main results. Firstly, this visit paved the way for Pakistan's return to the Commonwealth. Since its independence, Pakistan had been a member of the Commonwealth. In 1972, due to the intense changes in the South Asian situation, Pakistan announced its withdrawal from the Commonwealth. With the evolving situation, Pakistan recognized Bangladesh in 1974, and formal diplomatic relations were established in 1975. The obstacles to Pakistan's re-entry into the Commonwealth have been largely removed. For political and economic reasons, it is necessary for Pakistan to rejoin the Commonwealth. During Benazir Bhutto's visit, the British government supported Pakistan's re-entry into the Commonwealth, and the Commonwealth Secretary-General invited the Benazir Bhutto government to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting to be held in Malaysia in October. This indicates that the 48 Commonwealth countries unanimously agree to accept Pakistan. Thus, the path for Pakistan's return to the Commonwealth is now clear.

In terms of economic and trade relations between Pakistan and the UK, Benazir Bhutto also made progress. During the visit, the two countries signed two agreements. According to the agreements, the British government will provide funding for private enterprises in Pakistan engaged in energy and power development. The British government will also provide assistance to Pakistan in teacher training, primary healthcare, improving slum housing, and rural water supply projects. It is expected that after Pakistan joins the Commonwealth, economic and trade relations between the two countries will further develop.

Benazir Bhutto and Margaret Thatcher also held in-depth discussions on the political resolution of the Afghan issue. The British government expressed full support for Pakistan's "two-track policy" on the Afghan issue, which involves continuing support for the Afghan Mujahideen while actively seeking a political solution.

On July 12th, Benazir Bhutto flew to Paris, where she held talks with the French President and Prime Minister. The two governments signed an agreement on joint investment and economic cooperation between private enterprises of the two countries. The French government also promised to help Pakistan develop nuclear power to address its power shortages. During the celebrations of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, Benazir Bhutto also met with other national and government leaders attending the event.

In the past half-year, Benazir Bhutto's several important visits have all been successful. Internationally, Pakistan's status has been further recognized. Benazir Bhutto has secured a considerable amount of foreign aid for the developing Pakistani economy, enhancing the credibility of the People's Party government, and easing the financial difficulties that have arisen since last year. This will have a positive impact on the stability of Pakistan's political situation and the development of its national economy.

    贝·布托访英法获得成功
    本报记者　任毓骏
    从7月5日至15日，巴基斯坦总理贝·布托对英法两国进行了为期10天的正式访问，这是她今年继沙特朝觐、正式访华、参加日本天皇葬礼、出访土耳其和美国之后又一次成功的外交行动。
    在访问英国期间，贝·布托和英国首相撒切尔夫人进行了两轮会谈，随行的外交部长、工业部长等人也和英国官员举行了相应的会谈。贝·布托访英取得了三个方面的成果。首先，这次访问为巴基斯坦重返英联邦铺平了道路。巴基斯坦独立以来，曾是英联邦成员。1972年，因南亚次大陆形势激烈变化，巴基斯坦宣布退出英联邦。随着形势的发展，巴基斯坦也于1974年承认了孟加拉国，1975年两国正式建交。巴基斯坦重新加入英联邦的障碍已基本消除。出于政治和经济原因，巴基斯坦有重返英联邦的必要。贝·布托访英期间，英国政府支持巴基斯坦重新成为英联邦成员，英联邦秘书长也向贝·布托政府发出参加今年10月将在马来西亚举行的英联邦年会的邀请，这表示48个英联邦国家一致同意接纳巴基斯坦。至此，巴基斯坦重返英联邦的道路已经畅通。
    在巴英经贸关系方面，贝·布托也取得了进展。访问期间，两国签署了两项协议。按协议规定，英国政府资助巴基斯坦从事能源与电力开发的私营企业。英国政府向巴基斯坦教师培训、基层医疗卫生、改善贫民区住宅和农村自来水等项目提供援助。预计巴基斯坦加入英联邦后，两国的经贸关系将进一步发展。
    贝·布托和撒切尔夫人还重点会谈了关于政治解决阿富汗问题。英国政府表示完全支持巴基斯坦关于阿富汗问题的“双轨政策”，即在继续支持阿富汗游击队的同时，积极寻求政治解决途径。
    7月12日，贝·布托飞往巴黎，与法国总统和总理分别举行了会谈，两国政府签订了一项关于两国私营企业联合投资和经济合作的协议，法国政府还承诺帮助巴基斯坦发展核电能，以解决巴基斯坦电力紧缺问题。在出席法国大革命200周年庆典期间，贝·布托还会见了前来参加这一盛会的其他国家和政府领导人。
    半年来，贝·布托的数次重要出访都取得了成功。在国际上，巴基斯坦的地位得到进一步承认；贝·布托为发展中的巴基斯坦经济争取到数量可观的外援，提高了人民党政府的威信，缓解了去年以来出现的财政困难，这对巴基斯坦的政局安定和国民经济的发展都将产生积极作用。
