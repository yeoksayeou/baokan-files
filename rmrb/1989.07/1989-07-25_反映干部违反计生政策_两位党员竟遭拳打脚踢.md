Edition: 6

The deputy secretary of the party branch in my village, Xing Zhanjing, and the village public security chief, Xing Xianliang, along with other officials, have exceeded the family planning quota. Party member Wang Laogen requested that they be dealt with on May 23, 1987, but was beaten by Xing Zhanjing and Xing Xianliang. We reported this incident to the Hebei Provincial Committee, and a leader from the province took it seriously and demanded an investigation, but it has not been resolved. In the spirit of taking responsibility for family planning work, I went to the township party committee on December 7, 1988, and stated that if the issue of Xing Zhanjing and others exceeding the quota is not addressed, the village's family planning work will be affected. The township officials told me to find the village officials. The next morning, when I went to see Xing Zhanjing, he said I was causing trouble and, together with Xing Xianliang, beat me up. As party members and officials, they not only fail to implement the party's family planning policies but also retaliate against those who report the situation, violating party discipline and the law. They should be dealt with.

Wang Facai
Communist Party Member, Beidongguo Village, Dongdi Village Township, Quyang County, Hebei
January 1989

Editor's Note:
After receiving Wang Facai's letter, the People's Daily's Mass Work Department sent a letter to the Quyang County Party Committee on February 21 this year, requesting verification and a response. On April 1, the Quyang County Public Security Bureau replied to the newspaper, stating that Wang Facai was injured by Xing Xianliang and others (suffering from post-concussion syndrome and left eye injury, reduced vision), and that the assailants have been punished according to the public security administrative penalties regulations. On May 12, the Quyang County Party Committee Office replied to the newspaper, stating: "Wang Facai's report that local officials have exceeded the quota is true. To further control population growth, since mid-April this year, the county committee and county government have organized 180 people to conduct family planning inspections at the grassroots level, focusing on rectification. The issue of Zhang Luozhan and others exceeding the quota in Beidongguo Village, Dongdi Village Township, has also been reviewed according to regulations. Those who were previously punished inappropriately will be re-evaluated."

Regarding the handling of Wang Facai's report on village officials exceeding the quota, the county committee office stated in its reply: The former deputy secretary of the village party branch, Zhang Luozhan, had his wife give birth to a fourth child in 1982, was fined 350 yuan, and was removed from his position as deputy secretary in the first half of 1988. He was also given a warning within the party for participating in the beating of Wang Laogen. The former party branch committee member and accountant, Xing Zhanchai, had his wife undergo sterilization in May 1983 and gave birth to a fourth child in August 1984, was fined 450 yuan, and was removed from his positions as committee member and accountant this year. The former deputy secretary of the village party branch, Xing Zhanjing, underwent male sterilization in May 1983 and gave birth to a third child in August 1984, was fined 420 yuan, and was removed from his position as deputy secretary this year. The former deputy head of the village committee, Wang Zengqi, underwent male sterilization in April 1986 and gave birth to a third child in April 1988, was fined 1155 yuan, and was given a one-year probationary period within the party and removed from his position as deputy head of the village committee this year. The party branch committee member and public security chief, Xing Xianliang, underwent male sterilization in July 1987 and gave birth to a third child in February 1988 (the child died two days after birth), was fined 560 yuan, and had one plot of responsibility land deducted.

Why did Xing Zhanchai, Xing Zhanjing, and Wang Zengqi exceed the quota after undergoing sterilization? On June 2, the county committee office replied that these three people exceeded the quota, either because they did not meet the surgical standards or because they fell within the possible range of postoperative recurrence, and further investigation is needed.

In fact, if the leadership is truly determined, investigating whether there are any fraudulent practices in family planning in Dongdi Village Township and Beidongguo Village, investigating why party members and officials in Beidongguo Village lead in violating family planning, and investigating why people like Wang Facai, who fight against violations of family planning, do not receive strong support from the local government, this "over-quota appeal case" that has lasted for two years should not be difficult to resolve.

### 反映干部违反计生政策  两位党员竟遭拳打脚踢

    反映干部违反计生政策
    两位党员竟遭拳打脚踢
    我村党支部副书记邢占京、村治保主任邢献良等干部超计划生育，党员王老根1987年5月23日要求予以处理，结果被邢占京、邢献良等人打伤。我们将此事向河北省委作了反映，省里一位领导同志很重视，要求查处，但始终得不到落实。本着对计划生育工作负责的精神，我于1988年12月7日找到乡党委，提出不处理邢占京等人的超生问题，村里的计划生育工作就要受影响。乡里的同志让我找村里干部。第二天上午，我找到邢占京时，邢说我找事，又伙同邢献良将我打伤。他们身为党员干部，不仅不执行党的计划生育政策，反而报复反映情况的人，违反了党纪国法，应该予以处理。
  河北曲阳县东邸村乡
  北东郭村共产党员　王发财
            1989年1月
    函调附记
    接到王发财同志的来信后，本报群众工作部今年2月21日致函中共曲阳县委，烦请核实回复。4月1日，曲阳县公安局给本报回函说，王发财同志被邢献良等人打伤（即脑震荡后遗症和左眼外伤、视力下降），已按治安处罚条例对打人者给予处罚。5月12日，曲阳县委办公室给本报的答复说：“王发财同志反映本村干部的超生问题是属实的。为进一步控制人口增长，今年4月中旬以来，县委、县政府已组织180余人深入基层，开展以补救为重点的计划生育检查活动。东邸村乡北东郭村张洛占等人的超生问题，也按规定进行复查。过去处罚不符合规定的，还要重新处理。”关于对王发财反映村干部超生问题的查处情况，县委办公室在答复中说：原村党支部副书记张洛占，其妻1982年生第四胎，被罚款350元，并于1988年上半年被免去党支部副书记，又因参与打王老根，乡党委给予党内警告处分。原村党支部委员、会计邢占才，其妻1983年5月做绝育手术，1984年8月又生第四胎，被罚款450元，今年2月被撤销支委、会计职务。原村党支部副书记邢占京，1983年5月做了男绝育手术，1984年8月生第三胎，被罚款420元，今年2月被撤销副书记职务。原村委会副主任王增奇，1986年4月做了男绝育手术，1988年4月生第三胎，被罚款1155元，今年2月给予留党察看1年的处分并撤销村委会副主任职务。党支部委员、治保主任邢献良，1987年7月做了男绝育手术，1988年2月生第三胎（出生两天后死亡），被罚款560元，并扣除1份责任田。
    为什么邢占才、邢占京、王增奇等人做了绝育手术后还超生？6月2日，县委办公室回函说，这3人超生，是由于未达到手术标准，还是属于术后可能的再生率范围，还需进一步了解。
    其实，只要领导上真正下决心，查一查东邸村乡、北东郭村在计划生育中有没有弄虚作假的问题，查一查北东郭村的党员干部为什么带头违反计划生育，查一查像王发财这样同违反计划生育行为作斗争的人为什么得不到当地政府的有力支持，恐怕这起持续了两年的“超生告状案”是不难得到解决的。
