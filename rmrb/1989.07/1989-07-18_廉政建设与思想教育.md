Recently, we conducted investigations in several units and found that there are several issues in corruption prevention that need to be seriously addressed.

The issue of hospitality. Some leaders preach the need for integrity but in reality, if the hospitality is not up to their standards, they become displeased. Additionally, some officials in charge of finances and supplies often link the quality of hospitality to their control over resources; if they are not well-treated, they might "hold back" resources in the future. Furthermore, some ordinary staff in important departments often consider themselves as "servants," believing that integrity is the responsibility of leaders, not theirs. If they are upset, they might "report" on others in the future.

The "four dishes and one soup" problem. In some places, the "four dishes and one soup" have been upgraded to small plates replaced with large ones, and large plates replaced with large trays. Within a single dish, there are whole chickens, whole fish, delicacies from the mountains and seas, cold and hot dishes, and everything in between. Add to that the extra dishes and changing plates, and although the table always has "four dishes and one soup," each meal consists of no less than twenty to thirty dishes.

The issue of giving and receiving gifts. Currently, it seems that without giving gifts, things that need to be done won't get done, while giving and receiving gifts is something that "heaven knows, earth knows, you know, and I know."

The problem of "entangling" relationships. In recent years, families, relatives, neighbors, classmates, comrades, colleagues, superiors, and subordinates have formed various intersecting networks. Some people, when it comes to integrity, adopt the strategy of "avoiding red lights," using tactics like "I buy something and you reimburse me, your family has an issue and I send a public car" to easily bypass institutional constraints.

From this, it can be seen that in corruption prevention, it is important to establish necessary regulations. However, fundamentally, it is crucial to strengthen the ideological and political education of cadres, enhancing their political qualities and sense of public service. Only then will corruption prevention have hope.

    廉政建设与思想教育
    最近，我们到一些单位调查，发现在廉政建设中有经常碰到的几个问题需要认真对待。
    招待问题。个别领导口喊要廉洁，实际上招待不好脸难看；还有掌管财、物的少数干部，往往把招待好坏与本人掌管的东西联系起来，如果侍候不好，今后免不了受“卡”；另有一些重要部门的一般干部，往往以“小伙计”自居，认为廉洁是领导的事，自己例外。让他们生了气，今后免不了受“参”。
    四菜一汤问题。一些地方的四菜一汤，小盘换大盘、大盘换成大茶盘，一盘之内整鸡整鱼、山珍海味、冷拼热炒应有尽有，再加上添菜、换盘等花样，桌上始终是“四菜一汤”，可每餐都不下二三十道菜。
    收送礼品问题。现在的社会风气，好像是不送礼，该办的事也办不成，而送礼、收礼确属“天知、地知、你知、我知”的事。
    “剪不断、理还乱”的关系网问题。近年来，家庭、亲戚、乡邻、同学、战友、同事、上下级等，形成了各种纵横交错关系网。一些人在廉洁问题上也来了个“见了红灯绕着走”，采用“我买东西你给报销，你家有事我派公车”的变通迂回术，很容易避开制度的约束。
    由此看来，在廉政建设中，制订必要的制度十分重要。但从根本上来讲，对干部还是要加强党性教育和思想政治工作，提高他们的政治素质和公仆意识。这样，廉政建设才有希望。
