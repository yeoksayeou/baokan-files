Title: Impressions of an Old Cobbler

Only occupying a small corner,
With glasses and the sun rising together,
Smiling, he inspects the footsteps,
As if he were the emperor of the city.
Footsteps come in all sorts of ways,
The world is chaotic and confusing,
Hurrying, leisurely, stealthily, casually,
Hesitantly, confidently,
All will find satisfaction
In the words that carry the scent of wine.
— Shoes, this thing, loves to break down.
People always have to walk,
The road is uneven, winding,
Then carefully read
A page from a traveler's diary.
What needs to be glued, with a stern look,
What needs to be sewn, with a thread of thought,
In the whispers of the hammer and the shoe last,
A few sentences of simple wisdom are struck out.
When there is occasionally some free time,
Light a cigarette, light a memory,
Open the blackened wooden box by his side,
Count the stories of shoes hidden for half a century.
The cobbler's epitaph,
The footprints on the road.

    老鞋匠印象
    晨光
    只占据一个小小的角落
    花镜与太阳一起升起
    笑眯眯地检阅脚步
    俨然是都市的皇帝
    脚步乱乱纷纷
    世尘扑朔迷离
    急步而来闲步而来
    悄步而来信步而来
    犹豫而来坦然而来
    都会从散着酒香的话语
    里得到满意
    ——鞋，这东西爱坏
    人总是要走路呵
    路低洼不平弯弯曲曲
    然后仔细阅读
    一页行路人的日记
    该粘牢的，用一抹严厉
    该缝合的，牵一线思绪
    锤与鞋模的碎语中
    敲打出几句晓白的哲理
    偶尔闲下来的时候
    点燃香烟点燃回忆
    打开身边发黑的木箱
    清点藏了半个世纪的鞋的故事
    鞋匠的墓志铭
    路上的足迹
