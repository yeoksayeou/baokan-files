National labor model and renowned cotton planter Wu Jichang and Shanxi Province labor model Dong Laifu recently proposed that new and old labor models and advanced workers across all fronts should serve as models in studying the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and maintaining stability and unity.

They believe that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have taken decisive measures to quickly quell the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, which reflects the wishes of the broad masses of labor models. We should seriously study and deeply understand the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and Deng Xiaoping's speech, unify our thinking, distinguish right from wrong, consider the overall situation, and oppose the riots. We should adhere to the four cardinal principles, heed the call of the Party Central Committee, stand firm, and face the test. We should play a leading role and, on our respective posts, lead, unite, and influence the surrounding masses to firmly guard our work posts and strive for overproduction. Agricultural labor models should focus on agricultural production and actively deliver patriotic grain.

Wu Jichang and Dong Laifu specially mentioned that a batch of college students have already returned to the countryside, and during the summer vacation, more students will return home. We should actively do their work, so that they do not easily believe in rumors, do not fall for tricks, do not connect with each other in the local area, and do not do things that affect stability and unity.

    吴吉昌董来福向劳模、先进工作者们提议
    发挥带头作用维护安定团结
    本报北京7月2日讯　全国劳模、著名植棉能手吴吉昌和山西省劳动模范董来福日前提议：全国各条战线的新老劳模、先进工作者应做学习十三届四中全会文件、维护安定团结的模范。
    他们认为：党中央、国务院、中央军委迅速采取果断措施，平息首都发生的反革命暴乱，表达了广大劳模的心愿。我们要认真学习深刻领会四中全会精神和邓小平同志的讲话，统一认识，明辨是非，顾全大局，反对暴乱；要坚持四项基本原则，听从党中央的号召，站稳立场，经受考验；要起带头作用，在各自的岗位上，带动、团结、影响周围的群众，坚守工作岗位，努力超产。农业战线的劳动模范要抓好农业生产，积极交售爱国粮。
    吴吉昌、董来福特别提到，目前已有一批大学生回到农村，暑假中将有更多的同学回乡，我们要主动做好他们的工作，使他们不轻信谣言，不上当，不在当地串连，不做影响安定团结的事。
