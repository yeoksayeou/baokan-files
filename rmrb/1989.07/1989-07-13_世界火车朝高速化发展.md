In the fierce market competition, trains, which are under attack from both airplanes and automobiles and are becoming increasingly obsolete, are now developing towards high speed.

In Western Europe, France and West Germany are the first to develop high-speed trains. France's TGV, which runs between Paris and Lyon, has a speed of 257 kilometers per hour. West Germany's ICE, under normal operation, has a speed of 249 kilometers per hour, and during trials, it reached the world's highest speed of 378 kilometers per hour. The speed of British trains is 201 kilometers per hour.

Australia is designing a high-speed train, abbreviated as VFT in English, with a speed of 350 kilometers per hour. It consists of 6 carriages, with a locomotive at both the front and the rear, a total length of 200 meters, and can carry 400 passengers.

High-speed trains have enhanced their competitiveness. In terms of speed, it takes about 8 hours to travel from Melbourne to Canberra by car, but only 4 hours by VFT. In terms of cost, a round-trip ticket from Melbourne to Sydney costs $370 by airplane, but only $100 by train. In terms of convenience, trains can travel from one city center to another, while airports are relatively far from city centers.

    世界火车朝高速化发展
    新华社伦敦7月12日电  （记者王国瑞）在激烈的市场竞争中，处于飞机和汽车夹攻下日趋没落的火车，现正朝着高速方向发展。
    在西欧，法国和联邦德国最先发展高速火车，法国的TGV，运行于巴黎和里昂之间，时速257公里。联邦德国的ICE，正常运行时速249公里，试验时创造世界最高时速378公里。英国的火车时速201公里。
    澳大利亚正在设计的一种高速火车，英文缩写VFT，时速350公里，由6节车厢组成，前后各有一个火车头，总长200米，载客400名。
    高速火车增强了竞争力。以速度来比，从墨尔本到堪培拉，乘汽车约需8小时，乘VFT只需要4小时。以费用来比，从墨尔本到悉尼的来回票，乘飞机要370美元，乘火车只要100美元。以方便来比，乘火车可以从一个市中心到另一个市中心，而飞机场离市中心较远。
