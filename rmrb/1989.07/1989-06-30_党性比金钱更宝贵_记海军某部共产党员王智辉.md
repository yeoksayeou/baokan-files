A girl called him "too honest"

Wang Zhihui is a staff officer in charge of a thousand tons of oil at a certain naval unit in Hainan. This man with normal human emotions, of course, also wants to marry a beautiful and virtuous wife. However, at 29 years old, he is still a "happy bachelor." He has had five girlfriends, but they either disliked the hard life in the military or thought he was "too honest."

Wang Zhihui, through an introduction, met a pretty girl from Haikou City who once told him, "My heart will never change, even if the sea dries up and the stones crumble." However, the sea did not dry up, and the stones did not crumble, but the girl's heart did change. The reason was simple: the girl's brother was about to get married and needed over 100 kilograms of diesel oil to soak the wood. With the wedding date approaching, she had no choice but to ask her sister to find Wang Zhihui. Seeing his girlfriend's anxious expression, Wang Zhihui hesitated. The oil depot had plenty of recycled waste oil; all he had to do was turn a valve, and it wouldn't be just 100 kilograms, but several hundred kilograms. However, he smiled and said, "I'm really sorry, I have plenty of oil here, but it's all for the military. If you don't have a way, I can buy some for you from a civilian oil depot."

His girlfriend was so upset that she cried, "If we have to buy it, why come to you? My brother only gets married once in his life. You can't be so heartless, and you shouldn't think about our future!" Wang Zhihui couldn't find the right words to persuade the girl, so he could only let her "show her hand": "Our relationship ends here!"

Relatives called him "unfeeling"

One day in April last year, Wang Zhihui had just walked out of the oil depot when he saw a local truck with 10 oil drums in the back. When he shifted his gaze from the back of the truck to the driver's seat, he was surprised to find a relative who had crossed the sea from the mainland.

Wang Zhihui quickly asked, "What do you need?" His relative, with a smile on his face, tapped the oil drums and said, "Isn't Hainan hot right now? This time I came to find work and visit you, and I also want to ask for your help. You know how things work in society these days."

Wang Zhihui gently persuaded, "You know our military regulations, I'm in charge of the oil, but I can't just give it away."

This relative hurriedly said, "I'm buying oil to give to someone to find a job. Just sell it to me!" Wang Zhihui firmly said, "I won't do anything illegal, you should go back!" The relative couldn't understand and said he was "unfeeling."

A speculator called him "naive"

Once, a speculator barged into Wang Zhihui's dormitory, placing a few packs of "555" cigarettes on the table, hinting for him to accept them, and indicating that there would be a reward after the deal was done.

Wang Zhihui returned the cigarettes, "What's the matter? I don't smoke."

The speculator patted his shoulder and lowered his voice, "Old brother, oil is making big money now! If you can get a truckload of oil out, you can earn at least a few thousand yuan."

Wang Zhihui said, "That's called 'private trading of public oil,' I won't do it." The speculator had no choice but to leave disappointed.

Is Wang Zhihui a "rich man" who doesn't worry about money? No, his father passed away, and his mother is weak and often sick. He already owes hundreds of yuan, and the tuition for his younger siblings almost entirely depends on his salary. He needs money. However, he believes that there is something more precious than money, and that is the integrity of a Communist Party member.

    党性比金钱更宝贵
    ——记海军某部共产党员王智辉

    姑娘说他“老实过头”
    王智辉是驻海南海军某部管千吨油的参谋。这个具有七情六欲的男子汉，当然也想娶一个漂亮贤慧的妻子。可他29岁了，还是一个“快乐的单身汉”。他谈了5个对象，人家不是嫌他在部队生活艰苦，就是嫌他“老实过头”。
    王智辉经人介绍，认识海口市一位俊俏姑娘，她对他曾表示“海枯石烂不变心”。可是海没枯，石没烂，姑娘的心却变了。原因很简单，姑娘的哥哥准备结婚，需要100多公斤柴油浸木料，眼看婚期紧逼，只好叫妹妹来找王智辉。看着女友那焦急的神情，王智辉徘徊踌躇。油库里回收上来的废油有的是，只要自己拧一下阀门，别说100多公斤，就是几百公斤也不成问题。然而，他微笑着说：“真是对不起，我这里油有的是，可都是部队的，你要是没有办法，我给你到地方油库买一些吧。”女友急得流着眼泪嚷了起来：“要是花钱买，还来找你，我哥一辈子就结这么一次婚，你不能不讲良心啊，也不为我们以后想一想？”王智辉一时找不到合适的词儿说服姑娘，只好听任姑娘“摊牌”：“我们的关系到此为止！”
    亲戚说他“六亲不认”
    去年4月的一天，王智辉刚走出油库，看到一辆地方卡车，车厢里装着10个油桶。当他把目光从车厢移到驾驶室里时，发现里面端坐的竟是从大陆跨海而来的亲戚。
    王智辉连忙问：“你找我什么事？”亲戚满脸笑容敲了敲油桶说：“现在不正是海南热吗？我这次来，想联系工作，顺便看望你，同时想求你帮个忙，现在社会上办事那套你是知道的。”
    王智辉婉言相劝：“我们部队的规定你又不是不知道，我是管油的，可不是随便放油的。”
    这位亲戚急着说：“我是买油送人找工作的，反正你卖给我就是了！”
    王智辉坚定地说：“违法乱纪的事，我不干，你还是回去吧！”亲戚一时想不通，说他“六亲不认”。“倒爷”说他“不谙世事”
    有一次，一位“倒爷”闯进王智辉的宿舍，将几条“555”烟搁在桌子上，示意他收下，并表示事成之后，还有酬谢费。
    王智辉把烟还给他：“什么事？我不会吸烟。”
    “倒爷”拍拍他肩膀，压低嗓门：“我的老弟，现在油料可赚大钱罗！你要是拉一车油出来，少说也能赚几千块。”
    王智辉说：“这叫‘私倒公油’，我不干！”“倒爷”只得败兴而归。
    王智辉难道是个不愁钱财的“富裕户”吗？不，他父亲去世，母亲又体弱多病，他已负债数百元，弟妹上学读书的费用几乎全靠他那份工资。他是需要钱的。然而，他认为，还有一种比金钱更为宝贵的东西，那就是一个共产党员的情操。
