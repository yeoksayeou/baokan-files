Fujian Establishes Hotline for Reporting Personal Income Tax Evasion

FUZHOU, July 2 (Xinhua) — Tax bureaus in various cities and counties across Fujian Province have recently set up hotlines for reporting personal income tax evasion, accepting public tips on tax dodgers.

According to investigations, many high-income individuals, such as business operators and self-employed entrepreneurs in Fujian, frequently evade taxes. For instance, some business operators use fake accounting and issue multiple invoices to spread their monthly or annual income over several periods to avoid taxation. Some performing artists who travel for performances use "group income" as an excuse to evade taxes.

In addition to promoting the importance of voluntary reporting and lawful payment of personal income tax through various means to enhance taxpayers' awareness, tax authorities have established hotlines across the province. This move aims to place high-income individuals who evade taxes under public supervision.

    福建设个人收入调节税举报电话
    据新华社福州7月2日电（记者孙静）福建省各地、市、县税务局最近陆续设立了个人收入调节税举报电话，接受广大群众对偷漏税者的揭发检举。
    据调查，福建省各地许多经营承包者、个体经营户等高收入者、偷漏税款的情况相当普遍，如一些经营承包户用做假账、多开发票等手法，把当月或当年的收入化整为零，逃避纳税；一些“走穴”的名歌星以“团体收入”为名逃税，税务部门除采取多种形式宣传主动申报、依法缴纳个人收入调节税重要意义，增强其纳税观念外，在全省各地设立举报电话，把“逃税款、发税财”的高收入者置于群众监督之下。
