Sports facilities open their doors to primary and secondary school students. This is another new initiative from the Beijing Workers' Sports Service Center. During the summer vacation, they have allocated a significant amount of manpower and resources to organize various sports activities to enrich the summer vacation life of primary and secondary school students.

The swimming pool, which had been closed since 1987 due to severe equipment aging, has been partially repaired by the workers this year, creating conditions for it to reopen to the public. A children's water park has been specially set up in the shallow water area, where children can exercise through various children's sports equipment.

The Sports Service Center also invites sports and arts troupes from other provinces and cities to perform for the students, fostering their interests and expanding their knowledge.

    北京职工体育服务中心向学校敞开大门
    暑期为中小学生组织体育活动
    本报讯　体育场馆向中小学生敞开大门，这是北京职工体育服务中心改革中的又一新做法。暑假期间，他们抽出大量人力、物力组织各种体育活动，以丰富中小学生暑假生活。
    游泳场由于设备严重老化等原因，曾于1987年停业。今年，职工们想方设法对游泳池进行了局部维修，创造了对外开放条件，并在浅水区特开辟水上儿童乐园，少年儿童可通过各种儿童体育器械锻炼身体。
    体育服务中心还邀请外省市体育文艺团体为学生们进行表演，培养兴趣，增长知识。
