On the peaks of the Liupan Mountains, there lies a tranquil cemetery. At an altitude of 1,800 meters, the western winds blow year-round, and even after the Qingming Festival, the landscape remains barren with no signs of new grass. The murmuring sound of the Jinghe River below is frozen in the cold mid-mountain air. The vast, lonely, and silent atmosphere envelops everyone who comes here.

I stand on the high ground of the mountain where Mao Zedong is said to have once stayed. This is a small piece of flat land beside a winding path. Rough limestone blocks are piled up to form a low, irregular mound. Wild grass grows between the stones, and in the summer, the grass would completely cover the stone grave, making it indistinguishable as a tomb, let alone a Red Army grave. A black rock slab used as a tombstone during the war was destroyed not long after the Red Army left. The tombstone is gone, and no one knows what was inscribed on it. Half a century has passed, and history has thus obscured some people, and history has moved on. Many of those who journeyed from Jinggangshan to Yan'an via Liupan Mountain were lone individuals who quietly joined the revolutionary ranks. When they passed through unfamiliar places, the locals did not know the names of these strangers. Those who fought with the Red Army often faced uncertain fates in the midst of battle. If they fell in an unfamiliar place, the hasty retreat left behind the fallen comrades, and thus, many heroic stories were forgotten in the rush of time.

Perhaps this is a symbolic empty grave. Those who were "unafraid of the difficulties of a long march" could have become heroes known to the world, but they died here. Their families did not know, and in the midst of the chaotic war, there was no time to pay tribute to them. Now, no one knows who they were, and even the existence of the Red Army grave here has become a mystery.

Standing before this pile of scattered stones, what can I say? History is not just made by famous figures; it is largely written by countless nameless people through their silent sacrifices. The nameless have not let history down, even though in the long scroll of historical memory, the nameless have left no words about themselves. Yet, the victory of the revolution was achieved by such selfless and self-effacing individuals. Famous people are indeed the minority.

I believe the strength of the Chinese nation is due to these nameless sacrifices, and the grandeur and greatness of the Chinese people are based on this silent power. This nameless historical force, though often appearing sad and distant, is an unstoppable presence that changes the world and history.

I stand up and see before me a towering peak reaching into the blue sky, standing steadfast and solemn. Dark green vegetation covers the mountain walls, vast and boundless, facing the mountain winds. A few clouds occasionally flash in the sunlight, hovering around the mountain peaks. These clouds seem to be the inscriptions on a tombstone, vague and unclear. These clouds also seem to be the flags of the martyrs, fluttering, symbolizing something yet nothing.

For a moment, I am struck by the grandeur of nature. The mountain peak is the greatest tombstone, erected for the nameless, even though the named tombstones have long been famous worldwide.

Facing the great mountain, I feel a sense of relief from my initial unease.

    红军无名者墓
    姚学礼
    在六盘山峰上，这是一片寂静的墓地。海拔1800米的高坡，西风一年四季吹着，清明过后，这里还是草芽未生的枯荒景象。那山下的泾河淙淙声，悄然凝冻在冰冷的半山腰里。空旷、孤独，死寂，沉浸着一切到这里来的人。
    我站在据说是毛泽东停留过的这山峰的高地上。这是盘桓的山道旁的一小片平地，粗砺的石灰岩石块垒堆成一个不高不圆的坟茔，野草在石头缝间长满了，若是夏天，草丛就会将石坟全部遮去，令人看不出这里是个坟墓，更不知这里是个红军墓。一块当年在战斗中用黑色岩片立的墓碑，早在红军走后不久就遭毁坏了。墓碑不知哪里去了，谁也不知碑文写的是谁。时间过了半个世纪，历史就这样湮没了一些人，历史也这样过来了。那些从井冈山绕道奔延安的红军，许多是独个儿悄悄投奔革命行列的，当远走他乡，路过一处陌生的地方，当地的人是不知道陌生人的名字的。跟红军闹革命的人，常在战火中生死未卜。不幸在陌生地倒下了，匆匆的撤离只好抛下牺牲者，从此，匆匆的岁月就将许多英雄故事遗忘了。
    也许这是一座象征性的空墓。那些“不怕远征难”的人本可成为令世瞩目的英雄，但他们死在这里，亲人们不知道，当年在戎马倥偬中也来不及奠祭他们，如今也不知道他们是谁，甚至这里有无红军墓也成了疑团。
    站在这片乱石堆前，我能说什么呢？历史，不都是有名有姓的人物创造的，大量的是许多不知名的人用默默无讯的牺牲撰写的。无名的人没有愧对历史，虽然在历史记忆的长卷里，无名的人没留下关于自己的只言片语，可革命的胜利正是这种群体的、忘我忘私的人来完成的，出名的人毕竟只是少数。
    我想中华民族的强盛该归功这种无名的牺牲，中华民族的豪迈和伟大也基于这默默无闻的力量。这种莫名的历史动力，尽管常常显得悲哀和渺远，但却是一种锐不可当的改变世界和历史的无声存在。
    我站起身来，瞥见眼前一座插向蓝天的高峰分外沉稳庄严，青黑的石草布于峰之壁上，苍苍茫茫迎着山风傲立，几朵不时映闪阳光的白云欲动又驻地缭绕在山峰间。这云似乎是一种墓碑的文字，模模糊糊，浮动不清。这云又似乎是一种牺牲者梦牵魂绕的旗帜，弘弘扬扬，意谓着什么，又不意谓着什么。
    一刹那，我被一种大自然的图景震惊了。山峰是最大的墓碑，它为无名者所立，尽管那些有名有姓的陵碑早已名扬天下。
    面对大山，我似乎为自己最初的不安感到宽慰了。
