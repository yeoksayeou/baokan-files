The *Pravda* today reported that the wildfire that has been raging for three weeks on Sakhalin Island in the Soviet Far East has yet to be extinguished. Preliminary statistics indicate that the fire has consumed over 200,000 hectares of virgin forest, nearly one-fifth of the island's total area. The most severely affected areas are Nogliki and Tymovsk districts, where at least 14 million cubic meters of timber in a forestry bureau of Tymovsk was destroyed, and oil extraction operations were forced to halt.

Sakhalin Island is a natural reserve for rare flora and fauna, a breeding ground for precious salmon, and a habitat for deer, as well as a source of fur-bearing animals. The fire has severely disrupted the ecological balance of the region.

The report states that paratrooper firefighting units from various parts of the Russian Federation are urgently engaged in extinguishing the fire.

The cause of the fire is still under investigation.

    萨哈林岛大火已持续三周
    新华社莫斯科6月30日电　此间《真理报》今天报道，在位于苏联远东的萨哈林岛，持续三周的原始森林大火仍未扑灭。据初步统计，大火吞噬了20多万公顷的森林，几乎占该岛面积的1／5。火灾最严重的是诺格林斯克和特莫夫斯克区，其中特莫夫斯克的一个林业局被烧毁的木材至少有1400万立方米，当地采油区的工作也被迫中断。
    萨哈林岛是稀有动植物的自然保护区，有着珍贵的鲑鱼的产卵场和鹿场，也是毛皮兽产地，火灾使这里的生态平衡遭到严重破坏。
    报道说，来自俄罗斯联邦各地的伞兵救灾部队正在紧张地进行灭火工作。
    火灾原因正在调查之中。
