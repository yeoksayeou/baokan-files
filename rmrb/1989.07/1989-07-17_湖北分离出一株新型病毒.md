Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 17th.

A new virus has been isolated in Hubei. Vice Professor Zheng Zhimin of the Hubei Medical College Institute of Virology, along with three others, successfully isolated a new virus from the blister fluid of a patient with hand, foot, and mouth disease. The virus has been identified as type 71 enterovirus. At an identification meeting held on July 1st, experts agreed that this is the first time such a virus has been found in China, identifying the culprit behind hand, foot, and mouth disease.

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is an acute infectious disease that was first discovered in Shanghai in 1981. This research achievement provides a scientific basis for the formulation of measures to prevent and treat hand, foot, and mouth disease, filling a gap in domestic research.
