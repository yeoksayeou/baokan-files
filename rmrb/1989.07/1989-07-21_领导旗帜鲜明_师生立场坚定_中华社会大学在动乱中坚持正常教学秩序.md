From mid-April to early June, the capital experienced a wave of student unrest, turmoil, and counter-revolutionary riots over two months. During this period, the Chinese Social University (hereinafter referred to as "Social University") largely maintained normal classes and did not have a single class that collectively boycotted classes or participated in marches. Most teaching classes conducted mid-term exams as scheduled in mid-to-late May; all 24 graduating classes completed their graduation internships, graduation designs, and thesis writing as planned.

On May 17 and 18, influenced by regular university students, 104 students defied warnings and participated in street rallies and fundraising during their free time. Later, about 20 more students made two banners, "Social University Art Department" and "Social University Architecture Department," and took turns sitting in Tiananmen Square. In response, the president's office issued a notice on May 22 with five demands. By May 28, all students and banners had been withdrawn from Tiananmen Square. After the turmoil escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot on June 3, the school decided to suspend classes temporarily due to transportation and safety issues. Classes resumed on June 12 after transportation was restored. The most affected majors missed about 20 classes, while the least affected missed 8. Each department took measures to make up for the missed classes, ensuring that the teaching plan was not affected.

Key Moments: Issuing Six Strict Requirements

The reason why Social University could withstand this severe test is mainly due to the following:

First, the school leadership was clear and firm, treating this matter as a top priority. They consciously aligned with the Party Central Committee, considering the school's actual situation, and proposed different requirements for cadres, teachers, and students at different times, always thinking ahead. From April 15 to June 16, President Lu Lin convened seven meetings with heads of various departments and majors to study student thought dynamics, predict potential issues among the school's students during the student unrest, and unify thoughts among cadres on how to solve these issues (such as addressing diploma issues). During this period, three written notices and multiple phone and verbal notices were issued. For example, the April 16 cadre meeting clearly stated requirements for cadres, teachers, and students. The six requirements for students were: 1. Do not form illegal organizations; 2. Do not participate in activities organized by other universities; 3. Do not organize illegal marches; 4. Do not boycott classes; 5. Do not engage in violence, looting, arson, or vandalism; 6. Absenteeism will be handled according to the school's student management regulations.

On May 17, when students in the German language teaching point of the Foreign Languages Department II demanded to march in the streets, Vice President Wang Yanhui immediately sent someone to work with the department's deputy head, Xu Huiquan, to do ideological work with class and team cadres and students, stabilizing most students. Eventually, only a few (along with 104 from the Foreign Languages Department I) marched for two hours during their free time, and no such incidents occurred again. On May 19, students from the International Finance major demanded to hold a supportive march. Vice President Liu Xiaohui personally went to the teaching point with the deputy head, Professor Xu Huijun, to persuade them, resulting in no students going to the streets.

Due to the school's clear stance and specific requirements, cadres knew how to act. When Tsinghua University students came to the school for coordination, cadres persuaded them away according to the school's regulations. When some students demanded to form a student union, demanded the president lead a march to support the unrest, and demanded to use marches and boycotts to pressure the government to solve diploma issues, these demands were all resisted by the cadres. Later, some students said: At that time, they did not understand the school's regulations and thought the leadership was conservative and orthodox. Now they realize that this was the greatest care and concern for them.

On June 12, when classes resumed, each department investigated and understood the activities and thoughts of the students. Among the more than 3,000 cadres and teachers in the school, except for three students under investigation, no one was found to have participated in the counter-revolutionary riot of violence, looting, arson, and killing. Except for a few students who were absent due to illness or personal reasons, the attendance rate was even better than usual.

Not a Single Cadre Participated in Marches

Second, Social University has a good cadre team. The school has 133 management cadres, most of whom are nearly 60 years old and retired. Among them, 119 are party members, accounting for about 90% of the total number of cadres. They have political awareness and organizational discipline, and in critical moments, they can consciously align their thoughts, politics, and actions with the Party Central Committee. During this incident, not a single cadre was found to have participated in supportive marches, written big-character posters, donated money, etc. During the period of transportation disruption, these comrades, despite their old age and physical weakness, braved the risks and walked or cycled to their posts. Some had to walk for five or six hours. During the school-wide suspension of classes from June 5 to 12, a few comrades still voluntarily came to work at the school. They dared to manage and control the wrong thoughts and actions among students. The deputy head of the Foreign Languages Department II, Liu Tingwei, saw students from regular universities posting leaflets and inciting students to march, so he tore up the leaflets and drove away the outsiders. The deputy head and class teacher of the Architecture Engineering Department, Fan Quanzhen, saw students wearing "suicide squad" headbands ready to march, so he criticized and educated them and invited the students' parents to do ideological work, making the students calm down and focus on their studies. The teaching point of the Architecture major at the University of Science and Technology, Yang Shiyi, used examples of domestic and foreign turmoil to educate students not to be deceived and used by bad people. After the martial law was declared, he also introduced relevant knowledge about martial law to the students, warning them not to break the law. The students in this class did not participate in any illegal activities over the two months and always focused on their studies. Many cadres used their personal experiences from the "Cultural Revolution" to persuade students not to be influenced by anarchist thoughts, while maintaining close contact with parents and teachers, thus enabling the vast majority of students to remain calm.

Third, the school has always emphasized ideological and political education, which has played a role in maintaining normal teaching order. Social University has held three school-wide ideological work experience exchange meetings. Usually, it dares to manage and control problems among cadres and students, and implements a dismissal and elimination system for those who repeatedly refuse to be educated. In 1987, the school established a Youth League organization with 2,117 members, accounting for 74% of the total number of students. In the activities of developing Youth League members, registering Youth League members, issuing Youth League certificates, selecting advanced Youth League branches, and outstanding Youth League members, the political awareness and ideological level of Youth League members were greatly improved. In this turmoil, the vast majority of Youth League organizations and members performed well, and many Youth League cadres helped class teachers do ideological work, truly playing the role of assistants.

Private University Students Cherish the Quiet Desks

Fourth, Social University has established a set of strict management systems. Cadres have post responsibility and attendance systems, students have student management systems, and usually, rewards and punishments are strictly enforced, with orders being followed. Therefore, during this turmoil, the school's several written regulations and verbal notices had a binding force on students and could be implemented.

Fifth, the self-funded, commuting, and non-assigned education system of private universities had a good effect on stabilizing students. Most students in private universities are those who failed the college entrance examination. They cherish the hard-won opportunity to study, and although the school's diplomas are not recognized, they are willing to pay tuition to learn knowledge and compete in the social job market to secure their foothold in society. They also know that their parents' economic situation is not rich and cannot afford to pay tuition without attending classes; they have no iron rice bowls, and if they do not learn skills, they will have no real abilities and will achieve nothing. Therefore, during this turmoil, the vast majority of students did not get involved, while the few who were most active were basically students who usually did not follow school rules, had poor academic performance, and had poor behavior.

    领导旗帜鲜明　师生立场坚定
    ——中华社会大学在动乱中坚持正常教学秩序
    钟射学
    4月中旬至6月上旬，首都出现学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱的两个月来，中华社会大学（以下简称“社大”）基本上坚持了正常上课，没有出现过一个集体罢课、游行的班级。多数教学班在5月中下旬按期进行了期中考试；全部24个毕业班都按计划进行了毕业实习、毕业设计和撰写毕业论文。
    5月17、18两天，受普通高校学生影响，曾有104名学生不听劝阻在课余时间上街声援和募捐，此后，又有20名左右学生自制“社大美术系”、“社大建筑系”两面旗帜轮流到天安门广场静坐。为此，校长办公会议5月22日发出五点要求的通知，截至5月28日在天安门广场静坐的学生及旗帜都全部陆续撤回。6月3日动乱发展成反革命暴乱后，由于交通和安全等原因，学校决定暂时停课，至6月12日交通恢复后即复课。各专业最多的缺课20余课时，少的8课时，各系都采取了补课措施，没有影响教学计划的完成。
    关键时刻发布六条严格要求
    社大为什么能经受住这次严峻的考验，主要原因有：
    一、校领导旗帜鲜明、认真对待，把这件事当作头等大事来抓，自觉地与党中央保持一致，结合本校的实际情况，在不同的时期对干部、教师和学生提出不同的要求，并事事想在前头。在4月15日至6月16日两个月中，于陆琳校长共主持召开了七次各系各专业负责人会议，研究学生思想动态，对这次学潮中本校学生中可能会提出什么问题进行预测，并对如何解决这些问题在干部中统一了思想（如要求解决学历问题等）。在此期间共发出三次书面通知和多次电话、口头通知。如4月16日的干部汇报会对干部、教师、学生都提出了明确的要求。对学生的六条要求是：1、不准成立非法组织；2、不准参加其它高校的组织和活动；3、不准组织非法游行；4、不准罢课；5、不准搞打、砸、抢、烧；6、学生旷课按学校学籍管理规定处理。
    5月17日，外语二系德外教学点出现学生要求上街游行的情况时，王彦清副校长立即派人前去与该系徐惠官副主任一起做班、团干部和学生的思想工作，终于稳定了大多数同学，最后只有少数人（与外语一系在一起共有104人）在课余时间游行了两小时，以后再未出现这种情况。5月19日，国际金融专业学生要求举行声援游行，刘晓晖副校长亲自到教学点与教学点负责人许慧君副教授做劝阻工作，结果学生没有上街。
    由于学校领导态度明确，要求具体，干部有所适从。当清华大学学生来校串联时，干部按学校规定精神劝走了；当有些学生要求成立学生会，要求校长带队游行支援学潮，要求用游行、罢课的办法向政府施加压力解决学历等问题时，都被干部顶住了。事后，一些同学说：当时对学校的规定不理解，认为校领导保守、正统，现在才认识到这是对我们最大的爱护和关心。
    6月12日复课的同时，各系调查了解学生的活动和思想状况，在全校3000余名干部、师生中，除3名学生待查外，没有发现参加打砸抢烧杀等反革命暴乱活动的。学生中除有个别人因病、因事请假外，到课率比平时还好。
    未发现一个干部参加游行
    二、社大有一支好的干部队伍。学校共有管理干部133人，绝大多数是近60岁的离退休干部，其中党员119人，约占干部总数的90％。他们有政治觉悟，有组织纪律性，在关键时刻思想上、政治上、行动上能自觉地与党中央保持一致。在这次事件中未发现一个干部参加过声援、游行、写大小字报、捐款等活动。在交通中断期间，这些同志不顾年老体弱，不怕风险，徒步或骑车坚持到岗到位，有的路远要走五、六小时。在6月5日—12日全校停课期间，仍有少数同志主动到学校工作。对学生中的错误思想、行动敢抓敢管。外语二系副主任刘廷炜见普通高校的学生来教学点贴传单，煽动学生游行，就把传单撕了，把外来学生动员走了。建筑工程系副主任兼班主任范衢珍看到学生戴“敢死队”头匝要去游行时，他进行了批评教育，并把学生家长请来做工作，使同学冷静下来安心上课。理工大学教学点建筑学专业杨式义等用国内外动乱事例教育学生，不要上当受骗被坏人利用，发布戒严令后又向学生介绍有关戒严的知识，告诫学生不要违法。这个班的学生在两个月中未参加过任何非法活动，一直安心上课。不少干部用“文化大革命”中的亲身经历劝阻学生不要受无政府主义思潮影响，同时与家长、教师取得密切联系，从而使绝大多数学生能保持冷静的头脑。
    三、学校一直重视思想政治教育，对保持正常教学秩序起了作用。社大开过三次全校的思想工作经验交流会，平时对干部、学生中发生的问题敢抓敢管，对屡教不改的实行解聘和淘汰制。1987年学校成立了团组织，团员2117人，占学生总数的74％。在发展团员，团员登记和颁发团证，评选先进团支部和优秀团员等活动中大大提高了共青团员的政治觉悟和思想水平。在此次动乱中绝大多数团组织和团员表现是好的，不少团干部能帮助班主任做学生的工作，真正起到了助手的作用。
  民办大学生懂得珍惜平静的课桌
    四、社大建立了一整套严格的管理制度。干部有岗位责任制和考勤等制度，学生有学籍管理等制度，平时有奖有惩严格执行，令行禁止，已形成了一种作风，因此，在此次动乱中学校的几次书面规定和口头通知对学生能产生约束力，能贯彻执行。
    五、民办大学自费、走读、不包分配等教育体制对稳定学生产生了好的效果。到民办大学学习的绝大多数是高考落榜生，他们懂得珍惜来之不易的学习机会，学校虽不被承认学历，但他们愿意交学费学习知识，到社会的人才市场上去竞争，去争取自己在社会上的立足之地。他们也知道父母的经济并不宽裕，不能交了学费不来上课；他们没有铁饭碗，自己学不到本事，没有真才实学，将一事无成。所以，这次动乱中绝大多数学生没有介入，而表现最活跃的少数几个人基本上都是平时不遵守校规、学习成绩差、表现不好的学生。
