Last summer, a type of fly known as the "screw-worm fly" rapidly spread in the area around Tripoli, the capital of Libya. This blue-green fly, measuring 8-12 millimeters in length, was first discovered in the Americas and is thus also known as the "American green fly."

Green flies specialize in sucking blood from fresh wounds and laying eggs in them. A single female green fly, with an average lifespan of two weeks, can lay eggs multiple times, totaling up to 4,000. The fly eggs hatch in the wound, causing it to enlarge. Within seven days, this can kill a dog, and within twelve days, it can kill a cow. The United States suffers billions of dollars in losses annually due to this pest.

Now, the green fly has crossed the ocean and is advancing into North Africa, Southern Europe, and the Middle East, its momentum fierce. In early June, the Food and Agriculture Organization held an expert meeting to discuss emergency measures and allocated $500,000 for the effort.

The United States and Mexico have developed an effective biological method for controlling green flies: establishing specialized green fly "factories." These facilities use 6,000 rads of gamma rays to irradiate the pupae of green flies. A 90-second exposure turns the pupae into adult flies that lose their reproductive ability. Reports indicate that a "factory" in Mexico currently produces 500 million such flies per week. These specially treated flies are then dropped by aircraft over affected areas, with a release rate of 1,000 to 5,000 flies per square kilometer. These modified flies mate with the local green fly population but do not produce offspring. Within a few weeks, the number of green flies significantly decreases. Subsequently, insecticides are used to eliminate the remaining flies.

    生物灭蝇有成效
    去年夏天开始，在利比亚首都的黎波里一带，一种叫“螺丝虫”的苍蝇迅速蔓延。这种蓝绿色苍蝇身长8—12毫米，最早发现于美洲，故又称为“美洲绿蝇”。
    绿蝇专门吮吸新伤口上的鲜血，并在伤口上产卵。一只雌性绿蝇，平均成活两周，其间产卵数次，数目多达4000。蝇卵在伤口上孵化，使伤口扩大，7天能使一条狗死亡，12天能使一头牛致死。美国每年因此而损失几亿美元。
    现在，绿蝇已跨洋过海，向北非、南欧、中东进军，其势凶猛。粮农组织6月初召开专家会议，研究紧急对策，并拨款50万美元。
    美国、墨西哥已研究出行之有效的生物灭蝇法：建立专门的绿蝇制造“工厂”，用6000拉德的伽玛射线照射绿蝇的蛹，90秒的照射使蛹变为成虫，并使之丧失繁殖力。据报道，墨西哥的一个“工厂”目前每周生产5亿只。这些绿蝇由飞机投放到灾区上空，每平方公里的投放数量在1000至5000只之间。这些特殊的绿蝇和灾区的绿蝇交配，却不再会繁殖后代，数周之后，绿蝇的数目就大为减少。然后，再使用灭虫剂杀死剩余的绿蝇。
