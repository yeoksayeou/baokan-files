Blood seeps through your military uniform,
You defended the dignity of the capital with your life.
In your brief twenty-something years,
The sun and the moon together
Recorded the path you walked.
You are also made of flesh and blood,
You also have parents and siblings.
Facing the mob's assault,
You thought of the people's safety.
For the future of the Republic,
You faced danger with unyielding righteousness.
You are gone,
But your spirit lives on.
Countless hearts surge like a great tide,
Even the vast square
Cannot contain the people's respect for you.
Wreaths upon wreaths,
Cannot express the endless grief.
The nightmare will end,
But the years will not forget the Republic's heroes.
On your tombstone,
Your immortal name will forever be inscribed.

    共和国卫士
    程幸福
    鲜血渗透军衣
    你用生命捍卫了首都尊严
    短暂的二十多个春秋
    太阳和月亮一起
    记载着你走过的路
    你也是血肉之躯
    你也有父老兄弟
    面对暴徒的围攻
    你想到的是人民的安危
    为了共和国的明天
    临危不惧浩然正气
    人去了
    精神长在
    无数的心猛涨大潮
    广场再大
    也盛不下人民对你的敬意
    花圈如林
    也诉不尽无限哀思
    恶梦终要结束
    岁月忘不掉共和国的英雄
    你的墓志铭上
    将永远刻着不朽的名字
