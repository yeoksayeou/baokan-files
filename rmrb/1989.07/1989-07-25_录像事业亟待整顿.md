In recent years, video has become popular in both urban and rural areas of China, delivering cultural and artistic information directly to every household. However, our video production industry is far from meeting the growing multi-level cultural needs of the masses. Some video programs have even degenerated into "spiritual garbage" that spreads pornography, violence, and feudal superstitions. What is the problem?

Nationwide, there is an abnormal situation in the production of video programs (mainly television drama recordings or video feature films) where high remuneration leads to a sharp increase in costs. Originally, the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television had clear regulations on the remuneration for performers and staff in television drama production. However, since the rise of commercial video films, the remuneration for performers and staff has continued to rise. Due to the high proportion of labor remuneration in the cost, the funds available for artistic creation have been reduced accordingly. Additionally, many creators have an improper attitude (merely "chasing money"), resulting in many video feature films and video programs being produced hastily and of poor quality.

Another problem is the chaotic management of production and the lack of smooth distribution channels. The production rights for television dramas are supposed to be granted by the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television and the Ministry of Culture. However, many units with production permits either directly or indirectly sell these rights, allowing some profiteers to exploit loopholes and produce low-brow, pornographic films for profit. This situation seriously disrupts the normal production, creation, and distribution of video films and is contrary to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

In terms of video film production, there is still a lot of untapped potential. The film industry has recently proposed the construction and development of a third viewing channel, i.e., the home-style video viewing method, which is correct. Since the film industry is currently facing serious issues of film production losses and insufficient funds, it is even more important to tap into its own potential, fully utilize idle human and material resources to develop film video tape production and television drama video tape production. This is indeed a good strategy to revive the sluggish film market.

Performing arts troupes with conditions should also actively engage in the production of television drama video films and stage art video films. The transition from stage art to video art is just a spatial transformation of artistic production. This transformation can expand the artistic activity range of performing artists, providing them with more opportunities to showcase their artistic talents. It can also open up a path for the idle artistic talents and audio-visual equipment of performing arts troupes, reversing the dire situation of insufficient film production funds, and expanding the audience and extending the life of excellent television dramas and television programs.

Regarding the mobilization of social forces to produce video films, state organs, enterprises, and institutions, as well as individual households, that do not aim solely at profit-making, should be encouraged to invest funds or facilities into video film production. The key here is strict management. We must not allow a few people to treat art as a business and video films as ordinary commodities. We must pay attention to the fact that video films are spiritual and cultural products and should undergo strict quality control and content examination.

    录像事业亟待整顿
    罗辛
    近年来，录像已在我国城乡兴起，把文化艺术等各类社会信息直接送入千家万户。然而，目前我们录像制片业却远远跟不上日益发展的多层次大众文化需求，少数录像节目甚至堕落成传播色情淫秽、暴力凶杀、封建迷信的“精神垃圾”。问题出在哪里呢？
    就全国范围而言，目前在录像节目
  （其中主要是电视剧录像片或称录像故事片）制作中，存在着一种片酬过高引起成本剧增的不正常的情况。本来，广播电影电视部对电视剧摄制的演职员酬金早有明文规定，但自从商业性录像片兴起之后，演职员片酬便一涨不落。由于高额劳务报酬在成本中所占比例过大，用于艺术创作的资金相应减少，加上许多创作人员的创作态度不端正（单纯“向钱看”），致使许多录像故事片和录像节目制作粗糙草率，质量不高。
    另一个问题是制片管理混乱和发行渠道不畅通。电视剧录制权本是由广电部和文化部批准授予。但有不少拥有制作许可证的单位直接或变相出卖制作权，致使一些投机好利之徒钻空子，制作格调低下、色情下流的片子捞钱。这种情况严重冲击了录像片的正常生产制作和出版发行，同时有悖于社会主义的精神文明建设。
    从录像片生产制作来说，现有潜力还大大没有挖掘和发挥。电影界最近已有人提出建构和开发第三看片渠道，即家庭式录像机看片方式，这是很正确的。目前我国电影制片业既然面临严重的拍片亏本和资金不足问题，就更应该努力挖掘自身潜力，充分利用闲置人力、物力发展电影录像盒带生产和电视剧录像带生产，此实为拯救电影市场不景气的一条良策。
    有条件的表演艺术团体也应大力开展电视剧录像片和舞台艺术录像片制作。从舞台艺术到录像艺术，这只是艺术生产的空间转化。这一转化，可以扩大艺术表演人员的艺术活动范围，为他们提供展现艺术才能的更多机会。更为艺术表演团体闲置的艺术人才和音像设备开拓一条生路，以扭转拍片资金匮乏的困顿局面，同时扩大优秀电视剧和电视节目的观赏面和延长其寿命。
    关于发动社会力量制作录像片的问题，凡不以单纯赢利为目的的国家机关、企事业单位乃至个体户，都可以将资金或设施投入录像片生产，这是应当提倡和鼓励的。这当中主要是一个严格管理的问题，不能让少数人把艺术当买卖作，把录像片当普通商品。必须注意录像片是精神文化产品，应该进行严格的质量把关和内容审查。
