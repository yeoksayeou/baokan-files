In May 1987, the West German youth Matthias Rust landed a light aircraft in Moscow's Red Square, becoming a world-famous news figure. After being released early last August and returning to West Germany, he continued to attract the attention of the media. The West German magazine "Bunte" was the first to purchase the exclusive rights to publish his memoirs. However, this memoir has not yet been published. The magazine's editor explained that after interviewing Rust, they found that his content was "worthless."

Recently, a Soviet journalist visited Rust's home near Hamburg and interviewed the West German youth. On the wall of Rust's room hangs a large photograph of him being tried in a Moscow court, serving as a memorable keepsake. Rust told the Soviet journalist that after returning to West Germany, he had a seven-hour conversation with several editors from "Bunte" in August last year. During this process, they kept trying to steer the conversation in a certain direction, always wanting to hear about terrible things, such as torture. Rust's account disappointed them.

Rust also said that he does not know why "Bunte" did not publish these materials. However, since this magazine had already purchased the exclusive publication rights, he could not provide information to other West German publications.

It turns out that "press freedom" is not something everyone can enjoy freely.

Although Rust has sworn not to do such things again, there are still people who consciously or unconsciously follow his example. Not long ago, West German television broadcasted live footage of the following incident: two West Berlin youths, Ingo Bettke and Holger Bettke, took off from West Berlin in two "Fox-S22" light aircraft at 4:30 AM, flying over the Berlin Wall while most people were still asleep, and landed near Treptower Park in the capital of East Germany. They picked up their other brother, who had been waiting in the woods as prearranged, and then flew back to West Berlin, landing in front of the Reichstag building.

Later, the Bettke brothers admitted that, to "confuse the border guards," they had painted Soviet military markings on the aircraft. This is truly absurd!

    鲁斯特与后来人
    许宏治
    1987年5月驾驶轻型飞机降落莫斯科红场，从而成为轰动世界的新闻人物的西德青年马提亚斯·鲁斯特，去年8月被提前释放回到西德后，继续为新闻界所关注。西德《明星》杂志捷足先登，购得了他的回忆录的独家发表权。但是，这一回忆录却一直未见刊出。该杂志负责人解释说，对鲁斯特进行采访后，他们认为，他所谈内容“没有价值”。
    最近，一位苏联记者前往汉堡附近鲁斯特家中，采访了这位西德青年。鲁斯特的房间里，墙上挂着他在莫斯科法庭上受审的大幅照片，作为难忘的纪念。鲁斯特告诉苏联记者，他回到西德后，于去年8月和《明星》的几位编辑进行了长达7个小时的谈话。在此过程中，他们老想把谈话纳入一定的轨道，总想听到一些可怕的事情，如严刑拷打之类。而鲁斯特所谈令他们颇为失望。
    鲁斯特又说，究竟《明星》为什么不刊登这些材料，他不得而知。不过，既然这家杂志已购买了独家刊登权，他就无法向其他西德刊物提供信息了。
    原来，“新闻自由”也不是谁都可以随便享有的。
    虽然鲁斯特已发誓不再干这种事，但仍有人有意无意地仿效他的榜样。不久前，西德电视台播放实况录相，报道了这样一件事：两名西柏林青年英戈·贝特克和霍尔格·贝特克兄弟，驾驶两架“福克斯—S22”轻型飞机从西柏林起飞，于凌晨4时半飞越柏林墙，乘大多数人还在睡梦中时，在民德首都柏林的特烈普托公园附近降落，把预先约好在丛林中等候的他们的另一个兄弟接上飞机，然后飞回了西柏林，降落在国会大厦门前。
    事后，贝特克兄弟承认，为了“迷惑边防人员”，他们在飞机上涂上了苏联的军用标志。这真荒唐之极！
