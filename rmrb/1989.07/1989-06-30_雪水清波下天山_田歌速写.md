The past two autumns, in Beijing and Shanghai, Tian Ge's works were performed in musical concerts. It was as if the snowmelt from the Tian Shan Mountains had meandered and finally reached the sea, creating a resonant echo. This is a display of a musician's technique, style, and school of thought.

Tian Ge, with a joyful heart, recalls an old story.

In the days leading up to the Battle of Fuxing in 1949, a war correspondent was leading a white horse in a hurried march. On the horse was a young female soldier who had fallen behind. The horse neighed, and the correspondent turned to see a young comrade with a face smeared with sweat, limping and struggling, her left foot swollen and oozing pus, covered in mud. On her backpack was a huqin.

This young soldier, aided by the horse's strength, was Tian Ge. The day before, she had jumped into the Wei River to push a stranded boat, accidentally injuring her toe.

The correspondent saw her grit her teeth and smile, revealing a row of white teeth, and he also smiled: "How old are you this year? Where is your hometown?"

"Sixteen. Shandong, Shandian County."

Her appearance was endearing, and the correspondent sighed: "The propaganda team is like 'all-purpose oil,' it can turn a person into a versatile talent. It all depends on whether you have the drive and can endure hardship."

On the plain of Guanzhong, where the grass was just turning green, a few simple words left a deep impression on Tian Ge's heart. This correspondent was later the famous writer Du Pengcheng.

When Tian Ge entered Xinjiang, she couldn't even read simple musical notation, let alone compose music. Someone mocked her, saying she was a "folk artist." "Is that even called composing? Squatting in the toilet humming, stand up and you've got three or four pieces, what kind of music is that?" Tian Ge was stimulated by these remarks. She took the best Italian violin issued by the propaganda team and immersed herself in the sea of life.

Snow-capped mountains, grasslands, villages, factories, military camps, and outposts—everywhere bore the footsteps of Tian Ge. In the secluded forest, he sat cross-legged, recording the old folks' tunes, and could only capture one tune in a morning; the first time he crossed a rapid river, the herdsman only heard a "plop" and saw no Tian Ge on the camel's back. Rushing forward, he saw Tian Ge tightly gripping the camel's leg, struggling in the waist-deep rapid. Year after year, Tian Ge learned to stand on his head on a horse, ride a horse to catch a sheep, and was skilled at taking notes on the melody on a six-pole cart.

When Tian Ge sang his "Night on the Grassland," the audience's eyes presented a grand and endless scene of the grassland epic. People were immersed in the boundless yet indescribable beauty. It was a summer evening in 1959. The setting sun was ablaze, and Tian Ge and the director of the film "Green Fields," Zhang Jiaqi, lay facing the blue sky on the vast and desolate Kela Mayi wilderness. The evening breeze blew gently, and Zhang Jiaqi took out a page of lyrics he had just written and handed it over:

Beautiful night, so quiet,
Only my melody lingers on the grassland;
I want to write a letter to a distant girl,
But alas, there is no mailman to carry my love...

Tian Ge couldn't help but gently pat the ground and hum softly. As the sunset faded from his pen, the melody was complete, taking only 20 minutes.

"Tian Ge sings sweet songs." That series of mellow and elegant lyrical works, like rainbows after the rain, emerged with the times and has already formed its own system. The 1950s' "Ah, Dear Ili River," the 1960s' "Spring Wind Blows Over the Dawn of My Hometown," the 1970s' "March of Revolutionary Youth," the 1980s' "Aisha," "The Shepherd Girl Maria," and "Our Great Motherland" ... like bunches of fresh flowers on the grassland, dyed with rosy dew, each with a light and clear musical line, sincere and unique national flavor, giving people the vitality of youth.

Xinjiang is a rare land of songs and dances in the world. Over 40 years, Tian Ge poured his heart and youth into this mysterious and vast land.

### 雪水清波下天山——田歌速写

    雪水清波下天山
    ——田歌速写
    杨闻宇
    前年去年两度金秋，京、沪两地先后举办田歌作品音乐会。仿佛是融自天山的雪水逶迤曲折，终于归海，发出了回澜声响似的。这是一位音乐家技巧、风格、流派结晶的展现。
    喜悦的田歌，说起了一桩往事。
    1949年扶眉战役前夕，一位随军记者牵着一匹白马匆匆行军，马上驮着一位掉了队的年轻女兵。马鸣“咴咴”，记者拧身，发现一个汗污满面的小同志拽紧马尾巴，一跛一晃，艰难跋涉，红肿溃脓的左脚沾着烂泥，背包上架一把胡琴。
    这个趁着马力的小兵就是田歌。前天跳下渭河推那搁浅的木船，不小心划伤了脚趾。
    记者见他咬住牙笑笑，亮出一口白牙，也笑了笑：“今年十几了？老家在哪里？”
    “16啦。山东单县。”
    他那模样怪逗人爱，记者便感慨了一番：“宣传队这个摊摊，会把人变成‘万金油’，也能让同样一个人成就一番事业。关键看你自己有没有出息，能不能下苦。”
    在草木刚刚泛青的关中平原上，淡淡几句话，却深深烙在了田歌的心里。这位记者，便是后来成名的作家杜鹏程。
    田歌进新疆时连简谱也不识，不会作曲强作曲，有人便讥笑他是“民间艺人”，“那也叫作曲吗？蹲在厕所里哼哼哼哼，一起身就是三四首，算哪家子音乐。”田歌受到刺激，背起宣传队配发的最好的一把意大利小提琴，沉进了生活的海洋里。
    雪山草原，村庄工矿，军营哨卡，到处留下了田歌的足迹。荫蔽的大森林里，他盘腿而坐，记录着老人的歌调，一上午只能录下一首；第一次涉渡湍流，牧民只听得“扑通”一声响，驼背上不见了田歌，赶上前一看，他正紧紧抱住骆驼的大腿，挣扎在漫腰深的湍流里。年复一年，田歌居然学会了马上倒立，骑马叼羊，善于在六根棍的马车上速记曲谱。
    当田歌弹唱他的《草原之夜》时，听众眼前呈现出草原史诗般的庄严和无限，人们陷入了体味无穷却又难以言叙的曼妙清新的意境里。那是1959  年初夏的一个黄昏，夕阳焚地，田歌和电影《绿色的原野》的导演张加毅面朝蓝天，并躺在空旷苍茫的克拉玛依荒原上。晚风习习，张加毅从信封里捏出一页刚刚写好的歌词递了过来：
    美丽的夜色多么沉静，草原上只留下我的琴声；想给远方的姑娘写封信，可惜没有邮递员来传情……
    田歌不自禁地轻拍大地浅吟低唱，在撕展开的信封背面涂涂画画，夕阳自他的笔底收束了最后一抹余晖时，曲子谱成了，前后只用去20分钟。
    “田歌唱的是甜歌。”那一系列醇洌隽永的抒情作品，像雨后彩虹一样随时代而出之，已经是自成体系。50年代的《啊，亲爱的伊犁河》，60年代的《春风吹遍了黎明的家乡》，70年代的《革命青年进行曲》，80年代的《阿依夏》，《牧羊姑娘玛丽亚》，还有《我们伟大的祖国》……像草原上一束束染霞凝露的鲜花，各自以轻盈明晰的音乐线条，诚挚别致的民族情调，给人以青春的活力。
    新疆是举世罕有的歌舞之乡，40年里，田歌将满腔心血、大好年华尽情地洒在了这块神奇广漠的土地上。
