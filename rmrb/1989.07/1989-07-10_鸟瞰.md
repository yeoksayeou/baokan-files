Behind the barracks, there is a tall water tower on the mountain peak. The top of the tower is at least 1000 meters above the ground, standing proudly and majestically towards the blue sky. Every day, I have to look up and gaze at it from a distance several times. Each time, I have a feeling, but this feeling is as vague as looking at the "moon" in the starry night, making it hard to believe.

One evening, I finally climbed up to the top and realized it was an illusion. There is a square wooden platform at the top of the tower, which has already cracked due to wind and rain. Around it, there are a few iron rods that have rusted like rotten wood. However, standing on it and looking around, it is indeed a pleasure. In front of me, there is a vast and serene sky, which suddenly opens up my heart. Looking down, I see the vast mountains tightly surrounding this small city. The peaks and ridges are arranged like heavenly soldiers and gods, exuding a unique masculine vigor. Witnessing such a magnificent and strange natural scene, I couldn't help but exclaim in joy and surprise, as if Columbus had discovered a new continent. From then on, the tower top has had a magical charm, and I always find the best time and the best mood to climb up.

After discovering the tower top, I suddenly felt that living in the mountains was oppressive and dull. Isn't it? You stand on the horizon, wanting to look around, but no matter how you adjust your angle, the mountains stand there indifferently, mercilessly, and motionlessly in front of you. One day, passing by a thatched hut at the foot of the mountain, I saw an old man and a child. The child asked the old man, "Grandpa, what is beyond the mountain?" "It's a mountain!" the old man replied in a muffled voice. "Then where is there no mountain?" the child asked again. "Grandpa has never been out of the mountains in his life, how would I know?" The child fell silent.

It changed. The mountain, in the heart of a young man from the south, has changed, losing its former charm and beauty. The next time I climbed to the top of the tower, I felt a faint sadness. Looking at the mountains surrounding the small city and the mountain people like a million soldiers, my thoughts were flying. Why do people always habitually call the originally existing object "nature"? Is this nature really natural? Look at its layout, it is so unreasonable. In 9.6 million square kilometers, the southeast has so many rivers, lakes, and vast plains; the northwest, however, has endless mountains and deserts.

When I was young, I heard the elders say that Qin Shi Huang had a "driving mountains and filling seas" magic whip, which could drive the northern mountains to the south. At that time, I really hoped that one day two mountains would fly in from the north.

Human beings, the most intelligent creatures, have great achievements that cannot be fully recorded in history. Many fantasies have become realities. Now, human high-tech has entered space, but can we do nothing about the Taihang and Wangwu-style mountains? Is it ignored?

I stood on the high tower top and once again had a bird's-eye view.

The mountains are too dense.

    鸟瞰
    纪小松
    营房后面的山顶上那个高高的水塔，塔顶距离地面至少也有1000米，傲然而神气伸向蓝天。每天，我要仰头和它遥遥地对望几次，每次总有一个感觉：但这感觉却又如星夜望着“满月”里的桂树一样朦朦胧胧，让人难以确信。
    一日傍晚，我终于爬上去，才知这是个错觉。塔顶上有一落脚的方形木板，经风吹雨淋，早已龟裂了，周围有几根铁杆锈得如朽木一般。不过站在上面，放眼眺望，倒是一种享受。眼前一派空邈静谧的天宇，让你心胸蓦然开阔起来。再往下看，只见浑浑沉沉的大山紧紧地环绕着这座小城。那群群峰峦如同天兵神将似地缓缓排列开去，独具阳刚之气。领略到大自然如此的壮观奇景，禁不住如同哥伦布发现新大陆似地发出了惊喜的感叹。从此以后，那塔顶便有了一种神奇的魔力，我总是寻得最好的时辰，体验出最佳的心境爬上去。
    自发现塔顶以后，我忽然觉得生活在山里很压抑很沉闷。不是吗？你站在这地平线上，想放眼望望，无论调整怎样的视角，这大山便若无其事、毫无怜悯之心、一动不动地横在你面前。一天，路过山脚一个草屋旁，见一老汉和童子。童子问老汉：“爷爷，山那边是什么？”“是山！”那老汉闷声闷气地说。“那哪儿就没山了呢？”小童又问。“爷爷这辈子也没有出过山，咋知道。”小童不再吱声。
    变了。山，在一个南国来的小伙子心目中变了，失却了往日的诱感和美感。再上塔顶，便有一股淡淡的愁绪，望着如同百万重兵一样围困着小城和山民们的大山世界，我的思维在飞动着。人们为什么总是习惯地把原始存在的客体叫做自然呢？这大自然真的自然吗？你看它的布局多不合理，960万平方公里上，东南拥有那么多的江河湖泊，那么广袤的平川；西北这边却群山迭起，荒漠无穷。
    小时候曾听老人讲，秦始皇手中有根“赶山填海”的神鞭，能把北方大山赶到南方去。那时，还真巴望有一天能从北方飞来两座大山。
    万物之灵的人类，有着载不满史册的伟大壮举，许许多多的空想都变成了事实。如今，人类的高科研已进入了太空，面对太行王屋式的大山便无可奈何吗？是不是忽视了呢？
    我伫立那高高的塔顶，再次鸟瞰。
    山，太稠密了。
