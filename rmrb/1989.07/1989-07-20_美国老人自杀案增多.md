According to today's New York Times, the number of suicides among the elderly in the United States has been on the rise since the 1980s.

The report cites government records indicating that since the Great Depression in the 1930s, the number of suicides among the elderly has been decreasing year by year. However, from 1981 to 1986, the number increased by 25%.

The report states that in 1986, the suicide rate among those aged 65 and above was 21.6 per 100,000 people, compared to 17.1 per 100,000 in 1981. During the same period, the national suicide rate in the United States increased from 12 per 100,000 to 12.8 per 100,000.

Many health experts in the United States are puzzled by the recent increase in the suicide rate, as the U.S. government has been continuously increasing welfare benefits for the elderly, making them healthier and longer-lived than previous generations.

    美国老人自杀案增多
    新华社华盛顿7月19日电　据今天的《纽约时报》报道，美国老人自杀案件自80年代始呈不断上升的趋势。
    报道引用政府有关记录说明，自30年代大萧条之后，美国老人自杀案逐年减少。但自1981至1986年却增加了25％。
    报道说，65岁以上的老人自杀率1986年为每10万人中21.6人，而1981年为17.1人。同期，美国全国的自杀率从每10万人中12人上升为12.8人。
    美国许多健康专家对近年来自杀率上升感到不解，因为美国政府不断增加对老人的福利，使他们比前辈更加健康长寿。
