Japanese and American Navies Conduct Joint Training

NEW YORK, July 21 -- According to an announcement by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force today, from July 25 to August 2, Japanese destroyers will conduct joint naval exercises with U.S. Navy vessels in the western waters off southern California.

The Japanese side will participate with three destroyers and five P-3C anti-submarine patrol aircraft, while the U.S. side will participate with the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier "Enterprise" and 12 other vessels, along with several submarines.

The exercises will include anti-submarine warfare and air defense operations.

To participate in these joint naval exercises, the Japanese vessels and aircraft departed from Yokosuka Port on June 16 and headed to the United States.
