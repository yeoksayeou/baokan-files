Xinhua News Agency, July 21st.

The Wen'an County Committee in Hebei Province has, in recent years, persistently conducted ideological and moral education for all party members in the county. This effort, combined with the rectification of grassroots party organizations, has enhanced the fighting capacity of party branches and party members, significantly improving the party's prestige among the masses.

Starting in 1985, the county committee utilized newspapers, radio, and television to educate the broad masses of party members, especially leading cadres at various levels, to regard the people as their parents, fellow comrades as brothers, to maintain integrity and honesty, and to serve the people.

The county committee and county government leaders led by example, refraining from building office buildings and residences, instead using the funds to construct a county hospital, schools, roads, a television relay station, and a retirement home for lonely and elderly veterans and their families. Out of the 383 rural party branches in the county, the majority have become fortresses leading the masses on the socialist path. In the villages, organizations such as moral appraisal committees, red and white affairs committees, mediation committees, and funds for acts of bravery have been established, changing backward customs like gambling, superstition, and extravagant weddings and funerals.

Under the influence of more than 18,000 party members, the social atmosphere in the county has improved, and some difficult tasks in rural work have become more manageable. This year, farmers in the county completed the delivery of the state's procurement grain to the grain depots in just seven days, securing the first place in grain procurement work in Langfang City for four consecutive years. The birth control rate has reached over 96%, making the county a model county in Hebei Province for three consecutive years. Social order is good, and public security work is unparalleled in Langfang City.

    对党员进行理想和道德教育
    文安县党组织发挥堡垒作用
    本报讯　新华社通讯员马海程、新华社记者任泽励报道：河北省文安县委近几年来坚持对全县党员进行理想和道德教育，配合整顿党的基层组织，使党支部和党员的战斗力增强，党在群众中的威信显著提高。
    从1985年开始，县委便利用报纸和广播电视，教育广大党员特别是各级领导干部要视百姓为父母，视同志为兄弟，清正廉洁，为人民服务。
    县委和县政府领导从自身做起，不建办公大楼和宿舍，腾出钱来，先建县医院，办学校，修马路，建电视差转台和供孤寡烈军属养老的光荣院等。全县383个农村党支部，大部分成为带领群众走社会主义道路的战斗堡垒。在村里组织起道德评议会、红白理事会、民事调解会、见义勇为基金会等组织，改变聚众赌博、迷信、婚丧大操大办等落后习俗。
    在18000多名党员的带动下，全县社会风气好转，一些难做的农村工作也不难了。今年全县农民在七天内将国家的征购粮全部交到粮站，连续四年夺得廊坊市粮食征购工作第一名。计划生育率达96％以上，连续三年成为河北省的先进县。社会秩序良好，治安工作在廊坊市首屈一指。
