Mountainous Shanxi Province's Shanxi Opera House Communist Party member and performing artist Tian Guilan has not been tempted by the trend of "moonlighting." In recent years, she has been fully dedicated to performing with the troupe and has voluntarily trained local talent.

Tian Guilan is a renowned Shanxi Opera performer in Shanxi Province, with a high level of artistic accomplishment, and has won the fourth national "Plum Blossom Award."

In October 1986, Tian Guilan was invited to perform in Hong Kong. During a 45-minute performance of "Beating the Gods at the Temple," the audience applauded more than 20 times. An old boss from a certain arts academy secretly approached Tian Guilan and said, "Madam, your performance skills are outstanding. If you stay at my arts academy, you will surely become a millionaire. I welcome you and your family to come to Hong Kong." Tian Guilan promptly declined the offer.

Tian Guilan has repeatedly declined invitations to leave the troupe and join other troupes to make more money.

Once, a certain troupe from Inner Mongolia sent someone with 10,000 yuan in cash to visit Tian Guilan. The person persuaded her, saying, "If you come to our troupe, we will pay you 200 yuan for each performance. This way, you can earn 50,000 yuan in a year, which is equivalent to what the state pays you in 20 years in salary and subsidies." But she declined again.

In recent years, Tian Guilan and other members of the troupe have performed more than 1,000 shows in rural areas and mountainous regions for the audience.

She also insists on teaching for free offstage, helping to train nearly a hundred young backbone performers for 13 different opera genres. Among them, 14 have become famous performers. In the summer of 1983, Tian Guilan went with the troupe to perform in the revolutionary old area of Shenchi County in the western part of Shanxi Province. She discovered that the small opera genre, Shenchi County Daoqing Troupe, lacked artistic talent. She broke down the barriers and actively taught the Daoqing performers.

Over the years, she has selflessly taught her skills in hand, eye, body, hair, footwork, as well as the techniques of "saozi" (quick movements), "handkerchief," "water sleeve," "fly whisk," and "fan" to the young female performer Huang Fenglan. Now, Huang Fenglan is famous in western Shanxi.

    田桂兰拒诱惑不“走穴”
    新华社太原7月3日电　（记者惠金义、通讯员胡有恒）山西省晋剧院共产党员、表演艺术家田桂兰，不受“走穴”之风的诱惑，近几年一心一意在剧团演出，并为地方义务培养人才。
    田桂兰是山西省著名的晋剧演员，在艺术表演上有很高的造诣，曾获得全国第四届“梅花奖”。
    1986年10月，田桂兰应邀赴香港演出，一场《打神告庙》45分钟，观众鼓掌20多次。某艺院老板悄悄找到田桂兰说：“女士表演艺术功力不凡，留我艺院定成百万富翁，欢迎女士全家来港。”田桂兰毫不犹豫地谢绝了。
    田桂兰多次拒绝了劝她离团外出搭班子挣大钱的聘请。
    有一次，内蒙古某剧团派人拿着万元现款登门拜访田桂兰，来人劝桂兰说：“你到我团每参加一场演出我团付你200元，这样算，一年你就能拿5万元，赛过国家20年付你的工资和补助。”但又被她拒绝了。
    近几年，田桂兰和剧团其他同志一起深入山区农村为观众登台演出1000多场。
    她还坚持台下义务传艺，为13个剧种传帮带了近百名青年骨干演员，其中有14名成了名演员。1983年夏天，田桂兰随团到晋西北山区神池县革命老区演出，发现小剧种神池县道情剧团表演艺术人才奇缺，她打破门户之见，主动给道情演员传艺。
    几年来，她把她的手、眼、身、发、步以及梢子功、手帕功、水袖功、蚊帚功、扇子功等表演艺术无私地传教给了小旦演员黄凤兰。现在，黄凤兰已名扬晋西北。
