Czechoslovak Enterprises Achieve Initial Results in Foreign Exchange Earnings

The national economic development report for the first half of 1989 indicates that Czechoslovakia's exports to Western developed countries have significantly increased, with foreign exchange earnings rising by nearly 23% compared to the same period last year.

A reporter from the State Planning Commission of Czechoslovakia learned that this is an initial result of implementing economic reform measures, expanding the foreign trade authority of enterprises, and adopting the principle of self-management of foreign exchange.

Under the old economic management system, the state controlled all foreign exchange. Enterprises and other units had to apply for approval for all foreign exchange needs. This system not only failed to flexibly meet the needs of enterprises in importing technology and equipment, but also greatly suppressed their operational enthusiasm. Since the beginning of this year, Czechoslovakia has implemented a system of self-management of foreign exchange in enterprises. After enterprises remit a certain proportion of their foreign exchange earnings, the remaining amount is self-managed. To encourage foreign exchange earnings, the state can also reduce the proportion of foreign exchange remitted by enterprises or increase the proportion of foreign exchange retained by enterprises based on specific circumstances. Starting from July, enterprises can also adjust their foreign exchange surpluses and deficits through the new foreign exchange market opened by the state. This measure has added vitality to enterprises, which are now actively seeking ways to improve product quality and expand exports.

    捷企业创汇获初步成果
    上半年外汇收入增长23％
    新华社布拉格7月28日电　（记者刘天白）捷克斯洛伐克今年上半年国民经济发展情况公报表明，它对西方发达国家的贸易出口显著增加，所获取的外汇收入比去年同期增长近23％。
    记者从捷国家计划委员会获悉，这是实行经济改革措施，扩大企业外贸权限，实行外汇自理原则取得的初步成果。
    根据旧的经济管理体制，国家一直统管全部外汇。企业等单位的外汇需求一律需申请批准。这种制度不仅不能机动灵活地满足企业在进口技术设备等方面的需要，而且大大压制了它们的经营积极性。捷从今年年初起，在企业中实行外汇自负盈亏。企业上缴一定比例的外汇收入后，余额自主支配。国家为了鼓励创汇，还可根据具体情况减免企业上缴外汇份额，或扩大企业外汇留成比例。从7月份起，企业之间还可通过国家新开设的外汇市场调剂外汇余缺。这一措施为企业增添了活力，纷纷想方设法提高产品质量，扩大出口。
