Recently, the "lottery savings" craze has swept across various regions, causing some incidents. Here are two examples:

In Yueyang City, Hunan Province, thousands of people hoping to "try their luck" and "hit the jackpot" formed long queues at a bank on Balin Street to buy lottery tickets. The results were mixed: some were overjoyed, while many more were disappointed. It was truly a case of "fortune favors the brave, but misfortune strikes the unprepared."

In Yining County, Xinjiang, some rural specialized households, in hopes of winning a motorcycle, used all the money they had borrowed from the credit union to buy agricultural tools to purchase lottery tickets. As a result, the money originally intended for agricultural tools soon turned into a pile of towels, soap, and blank tapes, but no motorcycle was won.

Such examples are not uncommon. Recently, the People's Bank of China has issued a notice to stop all forms of "lottery savings," which is a timely decision.

Lottery savings have a "stimulating" effect and can significantly attract idle social funds. Although some people did not win their desired prizes, they still increased the bank's savings funds. However, this method has significant drawbacks. There is a saying, "Without unexpected wealth, one cannot become rich; without night grass, a horse cannot become fat." Lottery savings stimulate this kind of gambling mentality, not guiding people to accumulate wealth bit by bit, but rather hoping to gain a large sum of money through a single risky bet. Implementing lottery savings can indeed attract some social funds, but it also fosters greed, madness, and even the desire for something for nothing, which is harmful to economic construction. Moreover, from a financial perspective, a significant amount of general savings being converted into lottery savings is akin to moving funds between banks, with no actual benefit.

This leads to the thought that in the process of developing a socialist commodity economy, when formulating specific measures and methods, it is necessary to comprehensively weigh their pros and cons. China has its own specific national conditions, and methods suitable for other countries may not be appropriate for China; they cannot be blindly copied, which is the first point. Material civilization and spiritual civilization are closely linked, and one should not pursue short-term economic benefits at the expense of long-term social effects, which is the second point. Objective conditions are constantly changing, and it is possible that one method is used more in one period, while another method is used more in another period; one must adapt to the times, which is the third point. As the saying goes, "When faced with two benefits, choose the greater one; when faced with two harms, choose the lesser one." By carefully weighing the pros and cons and choosing the methods wisely, and then implementing them, our economic construction can develop more smoothly.

    全面权衡方法的利弊
    瓯亮
    前些时，各地盛行“摸奖储蓄热”，招来一些事端。试举二例：
    湖南岳阳市，数以千计想“试试手气”、“撞撞大运”的人，在巴陵街一家银行摸奖处排成长龙，争购奖券。结果，当场开奖，欣喜若狂的有之，垂头丧气的更多，真可谓“时来顽铁生辉，运去黄金减色”。
    新疆伊宁县，有些农村专业户为摸到摩托车，将刚从信用社贷来的买农具的钱，竭其所有地购买奖券，以至过不多时，原准备买农具的钱便化为一堆中奖而得的毛巾、香皂、空白磁带，摩托车却没摸中。
    如此事例，在所不少。最近，中国人民银行总行已发出通知，停止各种形式的“摸奖储蓄”，这是及时的决定。
    摸奖储蓄，有“刺激性”，可以较明显地起到吸收社会闲散资金的作用。一些人虽然没有摸中理想的奖品，仍增加了国家银行的储蓄资金。但这种办法，却有较大的副作用。有一句俗话，叫做“人无横财不富，马无夜草不肥”。摸奖储蓄正是刺激了人们这种侥幸心理，不是把人们思想引导到一点一滴地积累财富上去，而是希求在孤注一掷的冒险中获得大笔横财。实行摸奖储蓄，固然可吸收一些社会资金，但也确实助长了贪婪、迷狂甚至不劳而获的心理，这对经济建设显然是有害的。更何况即使从金融的角度看，相当数量的一般储蓄转移为摸奖储蓄，无异于资金在银行之间搬家，并无实际益处。
    由此联想到，发展社会主义商品经济过程中，在制订一些具体措施和方法时，必须全面权衡它们的利弊。我国有具体的国情，适用于别国的办法，硬搬到我国就不见得合适，不可生搬硬套，此其一；物质文明建设和精神文明建设紧密相联，切不可单为局部的经济效益而忽视长远的社会效应，此其二；客观条件不断变化，很可能一个时期此种办法用得多一些，另一个时期别种办法用得多一些，必须审时度势，此其三。谚曰：“两利相较取其重，两害相权取其轻”。审慎地权衡利弊，仔细地选择办法，然后实行，我们的经济建设才可以发展得更顺利一些。
