The Shanxi Provincial Health Department recently decided to focus on addressing the most strongly criticized issues in the medical and healthcare sector: arbitrary fees, excessive price hikes, and a few individuals with deteriorating medical ethics who use their positions for personal gain, soliciting gifts and accepting bribes.

In recent years, various corrupt practices in the medical and healthcare sector have sparked strong dissatisfaction among the public, hindering and damaging the progress and reputation of healthcare reforms. To address this, the Shanxi Provincial Health Department has made four key decisions for rectification.

	Firstly, to rectify the issue of surgical fees. Henceforth, except for registration fees, bed fees, surgical fees, and nursing fees, which will be standardized by the province, other fees will be managed at different levels.

	Secondly, all hospitals at various levels and of various types must not include drug sales in the economic indicators for departmental contracts or use them as a basis for bonuses. They must not substitute goods for drugs or sell items unrelated to clinical treatment. All violations of financial regulations, arbitrary fees, and excessive price hikes must be strictly investigated and punished.

	Thirdly, to firmly correct and prevent the erroneous practice of not accumulating funds but instead distributing them, and to stop the short-sighted behavior of overusing equipment and physical labor.

	Fourthly, for cases of using medical positions for personal gain, taking advantage of people's difficulties to solicit gifts and accept bribes, once discovered or reported, they must be thoroughly investigated without any leniency or cover-ups. Through strengthening the constraint mechanism and improving the supervision system, the medical sector should gradually form a strict and effective monitoring network from within and without, from top to bottom, ensuring an integrated and cross-sectional control.

    山西惩治医疗部门腐败现象
    重点解决乱收费滥涨价和以医谋私等问题
    新华社太原7月15日电  山西省卫生厅最近决定，重点解决当前群众反映最强烈的医疗卫生部门乱收费、滥涨价和极少数医德败坏的人以医谋私、索礼受贿等问题。
    近几年来，医疗卫生部门的一些腐败现象引起群众的强烈不满，影响和损害了卫生改革的步伐和声誉。对此，山西省卫生厅做出四项决定加以整顿。
    ——首先对手术收费问题进行整顿。今后除挂号费、床位费、手术费、护理费四项收费标准由省里统一制定外，其它收费实行分级管理。
    ——各级各类医院一律不得把药品收入纳入科室承包的经济指标中参与奖金提成，一律不得以物顶药，不得经销与临床治疗无直接关系的物品。要严肃查处一切违反财务制度滥收费、乱涨价的问题。
    ——要坚决纠正和防止不讲积累分光吃尽，拚设备、拚体力搞短期行为的错误做法。
    ——对于以医谋私、乘人之难索礼受贿等问题，一经发现和举报，要一查到底，绝不姑息迁就。要通过强化制约机制、完善监督系统，使医疗部门从内到外、从上到下，逐步形成一个内外结合、立体交叉的严密有效的监控网。
