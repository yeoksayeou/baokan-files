The Study Society of Workers' Ideological and Political Work held a symposium today to study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Deng Xiaoping's recent speeches, and to discuss how to effectively strengthen ideological and political work in enterprises.

The symposium was presided over by Yuan Baohua, the president of the Study Society of Workers' Ideological and Political Work. He said that the lessons from the recent turmoil and suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion are profound. In the new situation, we must deeply study and understand the documents of the Fourth Plenum and Comrade Xiaoping's speeches, reflect on the past, and think about the future. For a period, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's policy of "diminishing" the party's work and ideological and political work, under the pretext of "reforming" ideological and political work, the excellent traditions of the party's ideological and political work were denied, which seriously weakened the ideological and political work. In this turmoil and rebellion, enterprises were relatively stable, and the workforce was generally good, but they were also affected by bourgeois liberalization. Currently, based on the study of documents and reflection, we must seriously conduct investigations and research, summarize experiences and lessons, and based on the actual situation of enterprises, propose opinions on strengthening education for workers to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, and further strengthen enterprise ideological and political work.

Vice President and Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department Wang Weicheng said that the bloody lessons of the counter-revolutionary rebellion once again show that strengthening ideological and political work is a very urgent task. Enterprises are generally stable. Through this turmoil, it is proven that the working class is indeed a great class. The stability of enterprises is inseparable from the role of party organizations and long-term ideological and political work. However, Comrade Zhao Ziyang emphasized "elite management" in enterprises, weakened party leadership, and denied the role of political workers, which caused serious damage to the ideological and political work in enterprises. Wang Weicheng believes that the following five tasks should be carried out: First, use the turmoil and rebellion as a negative example to conduct education among workers to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization; second, strengthen party building during the implementation of the factory director responsibility system. Party organizations should play a core role in enterprise ideological and political work through rectification; third, insist on the working class's role as the master of enterprises and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workforce; fourth, stabilize the team of political workers and build a strong professional ideological and political work team; fifth, through investigations and research, seriously summarize the experiences of ideological and political work in recent years, and make enterprise party organizations truly focus on ideological and political work.

Consultant Deng Ligong of the Study Society said that the nature of this struggle is the struggle between adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. After Comrade Zhao Ziyang took office as the General Secretary, the serious consequences in the ideological and political field are multifaceted and need to be carefully cleaned up. Under the erroneous policies of Zhao Ziyang, many factory party secretaries and factory directors remained sober-minded, adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, strengthened party building, and improved relations between cadres and the masses, resisting his errors. These experiences are very valuable and should be carefully investigated and summarized. Based on the investigation and summary, propose opinions on implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Comrade Xiaoping's speeches and strengthening enterprise ideological and political work.

Consultant Xu Weicheng of the Beijing Municipal Committee said that through this turmoil and rebellion, it is fully proven that the working class is indeed a great leading class. At the same time, it also exposed the weak aspects of workers' ideological and political work, and the education of communism, patriotism, and collectivism for workers, especially young workers, must be strengthened. In the suppression of the rebellion, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army did not hesitate to sacrifice themselves, and the people selflessly rescued others, proving that the spirit of communism is deeply rooted in our society. These excellent traditions and revolutionary spirits need to be well inherited and carried forward.

Consultants Gu Dachun and Vice President Liu Shi of the Study Society believe that Comrade Zhao Ziyang's erroneous policies have degraded and damaged the historical status of the working class, greatly suppressing and discouraging the initiative of the working class as the master. In the future, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, strengthen the education of the historical status and mission of the working class, and cultivate a new generation of workers well.

Consultants Zhang Zhi, Zhang Yanning, Zhao Yinhua, and Zeng Qun also spoke at the meeting. Wang Renzhi, Minister of the Propaganda Department, attended today's symposium. Other consultants and vice presidents of the Study Society of Workers' Ideological and Political Work, such as Feng Jixin, Yu Qinghe, Feng Jun, Guan Tao, and Li Chuanhua, also attended today's symposium.

    职工思想政治工作研究会举行座谈会提出
    学习全会精神和邓小平讲话  加强企业职工思想政治工作
    新华社北京7月8日电　中国职工思想政治工作研究会今天举行座谈会，学习、贯彻四中全会精神和邓小平同志最近的几次讲话，研究如何切实加强企业职工思想政治工作。
    座谈会由中国职工思想政治工作研究会会长袁宝华主持。他说，这次制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱给我们的教训是十分深刻的。在新的形势下，要深入学习、领会四中全会的文件和小平同志的讲话，思考过去，思考未来。在一段时期，由于赵紫阳同志对党的工作和思想政治工作采取了“淡化”的方针，借口“改造”思想政治工作否定党的思想政治工作的优良传统，从而严重地削弱了思想政治工作。在这次动乱和暴乱中，企业还是比较稳定的，职工队伍总的是很好的，但也受到资产阶级自由化的侵蚀。当前在学习文件、进行反思的基础上，要认真地开展调查研究，总结经验教训，从企业的实际情况出发，提出加强对职工进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，进一步加强企业思想政治工作的意见。
    研究会副会长、中宣部副部长王维澄说，这次反革命暴乱的血的教训，再一次说明了加强思想政治工作是一项非常紧迫的任务。企业从总体上看是稳定的。通过这场风波的考验，证明工人阶级确实是伟大的阶级。企业的稳定，是与党组织发挥作用、与长期的思想政治工作分不开的。但赵紫阳同志在企业中强调“精英治厂”，淡化党的领导，削弱党的领导，否定政工干部的作用等，给企业的思想政治工作造成了严重的损害。王维澄认为，当前要抓五件事：一、利用动乱和暴乱这个反面教材，在职工中进行坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化的教育；二、在实行厂长负责制过程中加强党的建设。党组织通过整顿，要在企业思想政治工作中发挥核心作用；三、坚持工人阶级在企业中的主人翁地位，充分发挥职工群众的积极性、创造性；四、稳定政工干部队伍，建立一支精干的专职思想政治工作队伍；五、通过调查研究，认真总结近几年思想政治工作经验，使企业党组织切实做到把思想政治工作作为自己工作的重点。
    中国职工思想政治工作研究会顾问邓力群在座谈会上说，这场斗争的性质是坚持四项基本原则与资产阶级自由化的斗争。赵紫阳同志担任总书记以后，在思想政治领域造成的严重后果是多方面的，要认真进行清理。在赵紫阳推行错误方针的情况下，许多工厂的党委书记、厂长头脑清醒，坚持四项基本原则，抓紧党的建设，搞好干群关系，对他的错误进行了抵制。这些经验非常可贵，应该认真调查，很好总结。在调查和总结的基础上，提出贯彻四中全会和小平同志讲话精神，加强企业思想政治工作的意见。
    研究会顾问、北京市委副书记徐惟诚说，通过这次动乱和暴乱，充分说明，工人阶级不愧为伟大的领导阶级。同时，也暴露了职工思想政治工作中的薄弱方面，对职工特别是青年工人的共产主义、爱国主义、集体主义的教育要切实加强。在这次平息暴乱中，解放军指战员不惜牺牲自己，人民群众忘我救人，证明共产主义精神在我们社会中是深深扎根的。这些优良传统和革命精神，需要很好的继承与发扬。
    研究会顾问顾大椿、副会长刘实认为，赵紫阳同志的错误方针，贬低、损害了工人阶级的历史地位，极大地压抑和挫伤了工人阶级的主人翁积极性。今后我们要全心全意依靠工人阶级，加强工人阶级历史地位和历史使命的教育，把新一代工人培育好。
    研究会顾问曾志、副会长张彦宁、赵荫华、曾群等在会上也发了言。中宣部部长王忍之参加了今天的座谈会。中国职工思想政治工作研究会的其他顾问、副会长冯纪新、于庆和、冯军、关涛、李传华等，也出席了今天的座谈会。
