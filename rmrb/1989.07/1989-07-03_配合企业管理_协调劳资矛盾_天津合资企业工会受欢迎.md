    Supporting Enterprise Management and Mediating Labor Disputes
    Trade Unions in Tianjin's Joint Ventures Gain Popularity

    The Tianjin Hyatt Hotel, a Sino-foreign joint venture, recently dismissed an employee for violating labor discipline. Upon learning that the employee was dissatisfied with the decision, the Tianjin Municipal Federation of Trade Unions immediately collaborated with the joint venture's trade union to investigate the matter. After confirming the facts and finding the dismissal justified, the trade union conducted ideological work with the employee, encouraging him to learn from the experience and seek other employment opportunities.

    It is understood that out of over 100 Sino-foreign joint ventures in Tianjin, more than 80% have established trade unions. These trade unions operate with strict fairness and adhere to the law, protecting both the interests of the employees and the enterprises, earning praise from both workers and management.

    In one Sino-Japanese joint venture in the Tianjin Economic and Technological Development Zone, a production halt was required for equipment maintenance. The management suddenly decided to lay off a large number of employees, violating the regulation that the trade union should be notified in advance of layoffs. The plant trade union promptly expressed its opinion to the management, pointing out that laying off workers during a short production halt would make it difficult to find skilled workers when production resumes. The trade union suggested that the management provide living allowances to the workers during the halt and retain them. The management accepted the trade union's suggestion.

    The Tianjin Otis Elevator Company, facing an excess of personnel, planned to lay off a batch of employees. Some employees had objections to this. The enterprise trade union supported the management's reasonable decision, on one hand, requiring the management to properly handle the benefits of the laid-off employees, and on the other hand, urging the employees to comply with the management's decision. The trade union's active assistance enabled the enterprise to smoothly carry out this task.

    When the trade unions in Tianjin's joint ventures were first established, many foreign managers had doubts, fearing that the trade unions might cause labor disputes and oppose the management. After a period of practice, many foreign managers dispelled their concerns, and some even proactively requested the establishment of trade unions.

    配合企业管理  协调劳资矛盾
    天津合资企业工会受欢迎
    新华社天津7月3日电（记者申启芳）中外合资的天津凯悦饭店，前不久辞退了一名违反劳动纪律的职工。天津市总工会得到这名职工不服的反映后，立即会同合资企业工会对此事进行了调查，得出情况属实、处理得当的结论。工会便认真做这名职工的思想工作，希望他吸取教训，另谋职业。
    据了解，天津市100多家中外合资企业中，已有80％多建立了工会。这些合资企业工会严明公正，依法办事，既维护职工利益，又维护企业利益，赢得了工人和企业双方的好评。
    天津经济技术开发区一家中日合资企业，因设备检修需停产一段时间。这时，厂方突然决定解雇大部分职工，违反了解雇职工应提前通知工会的规定。厂工会立即向厂方提出意见，指出如在短期停产期间解雇工人，重新开工后一时恐难找到技术熟练的工人，建议厂方在停产期间给他们发生活费，留下这些工人。厂方接受了工会的建议。
    天津奥的斯电梯有限公司因人员过剩，打算裁减一批职工，部分职工对此有意见。企业工会对厂方的这种合理做法采取了支持态度，他们一方面要求厂方认真落实被裁减人员的应有待遇，另一方面要求职工服从厂方决定。工会的积极协助使企业顺利做好这项工作。
    天津市合资企业刚开始成立工会时，不少外方管理人员心有疑虑，怕工会闹工潮，与厂方对着干。经过一段时间的实践，许多外方管理人员打消了顾虑，有的外方管理人员还主动要求成立工会。
