    Through concerted efforts, Tianjin's annual average ground subsidence rate has decreased from 86 millimeters in 1985 to 24 millimeters, achieving the goal set by the municipal government three years ago to control ground subsidence.

    To manage underground water resources and control ground subsidence, relevant municipal departments have worked closely together. They have adjusted 73 kilometers of pipelines, shut down 597 wells, and sealed 140 abandoned wells. At the same time, they have scientifically arranged the layout of retained wells and controlled the amount of water extracted, while organizing water recharge.
