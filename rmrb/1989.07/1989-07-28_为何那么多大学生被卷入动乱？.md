A political storm that lasted over two months, involving student unrest, turmoil, and riots, has finally subsided. However, the bloody lessons it left behind have given us much to ponder. Why did so many college students, willingly or unwittingly, join or get swept up in this wave of student unrest and turmoil? After studying and analyzing the objective and subjective reasons why college students participated in the student unrest and turmoil, we can see that the arrival of this storm was inevitable, and it was also inevitable that college students would be drawn into it.

Misguided Patriotism Leads to the Path of Liberalization

Contemporary college students are a generation that was born during the "Ten Years of Turmoil," grew up during the period of rectifying past mistakes, and studied during the era of reform and opening up. This unique environment has endowed contemporary college students with many valuable qualities: they have broad knowledge, sharp minds, support reform, oppose conservatism, thirst for knowledge, and aspire to achieve greatness. However, they also have many obvious flaws and weaknesses that were fully exposed during this complex turmoil. They are filled with various contradictions; although they have many good wishes and demands, they often cannot align them with correct actions. Therefore, they are easily exploited by those with ulterior motives, leading to tragic outcomes.

Firstly, they have patriotic fervor but lack a firm and correct political direction. The facts of the student unrest and turmoil show that many college students' mistakes do not lie in their excessive patriotism but in the fact that this patriotism is not built on a scientific foundation and lacks a correct political direction. For a period, many college students neglected their political cultivation, slackened their study of Marxism-Leninism, and showed little interest in courses on the current situation and political theory, often skipping classes. Over time, this led to a wavering belief in the Party and a crisis of faith in Marxism-Leninism. Not only could they not resist political germs and weeds, but they also regarded bourgeois ideas as the elixir for national prosperity and strength. In this situation, patriotic fervor without a correct political direction cannot but be exploited by a handful of people who use the banner of patriotism to promote bourgeois liberalization. The more intense this fervor, the deeper they will sink into the mire.

Demanding Democracy in an Undemocratic Manner

Secondly, they have a sense of democracy but lack good democratic qualities and a sense of discipline and law. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's democratic construction has been continuously developing. In this good environment, college students' democratic aspirations and democratic consciousness have been continuously developing, and their democratic consciousness has been increasingly strong. However, as college students' democratic consciousness has strengthened, their ability to adapt to democratic life and their sense of discipline and law have not correspondingly improved. They have had few opportunities to practice democratic life, do not know how to promote democracy within the scope of discipline and law, and do not know how to express democratic demands through proper democratic channels and forms. As a result, democratic demands and undemocratic behaviors often appear simultaneously. In a situation where there is a strong sense of democracy but a lack of democratic life qualities and a sense of discipline and law, so-called democratic activities often seriously infringe upon others' democratic rights, disrupt normal study, work, life, and social order. During the student unrest, many students arbitrarily attacked leaders elected by people's congresses and party congresses at various levels, stormed relevant departments, and placed themselves in the position of "special citizens."

A Desire to Participate Without the Ability or Experience

Thirdly, they have a desire to participate but lack the ability and political experience to participate in social affairs. The vast majority of college students go from one school to another without experiencing much turmoil, have an incomplete understanding of China's national conditions, and have an incomplete understanding and perception of society. They also lack the ability to cope with complex social situations. Therefore, college students should spend their time in school learning and preparing to participate in society, rather than focusing primarily on social activities. During the student unrest, many college students lacked sufficient mental preparation and blindly participated, fantasizing about gaining fame across the province or nation through participation and realizing their own value. They showed extreme political immaturity, unable to calmly and rationally analyze problems and consider consequences, and became the "hostages" and "tools" of those political conspirators, ultimately descending into the abyss of error.

Stubbornly Asserting Individuality

Fourthly, they have a desire for independence but lack the spirit of self-criticism and seeking truth from facts. For a period, college students have been pampered by society. Many college students did not take the praise from society as the expectations and encouragement of the Party and the people but became intoxicated and arrogant. They could not realistically assess themselves but blindly overestimated themselves. This led them to detach from the workers and peasants, unable to correctly learn from society, history, and the older generation of revolutionaries, forming a "who else but me under heaven" mentality. This mentality, combined with the desire for autonomy and independence, inevitably produced stubborn behavior. During the student unrest, they could not heed the Party and government's advice, believing that their individuality and independence were suppressed, acting stubbornly, and thus inevitably drifting further away from the Party and the people's requirements.

A Sense of Historical Responsibility Without Hard Work and Moral Discipline

Fifthly, they have a sense of historical responsibility but lack the spirit of hard work and strict moral cultivation, neglecting strict self-discipline and tempering. During the student unrest, some college students bluntly stated that they went on strike, boycotted exams, and left school to avoid and escape hard study. Some students vented their dissatisfaction by destroying state property and school facilities, and by abusing school leaders and teachers, showing a very low moral level. Practice has proven that these students are most easily influenced by extreme anarchism and drawn into the student unrest and turmoil.

The weaknesses and flaws of college students are important reasons for their mistakes, but the external conditions and environment have also had some influence on them, which cannot but make us reflect calmly. For a period, the objective environment in which college students find themselves has shown many abnormal phenomena. Bourgeois liberalization has surrounded them, and there have been no strong measures to help them escape this influence. This unhealthy environment, combined with the weaknesses of college students, has caused their originally not very firm beliefs, standpoints, and attitudes to tilt seriously.

In recent years, the reverse current of bourgeois liberalization has not only not been curbed but has instead developed and spread, becoming rampant. Some propaganda and public opinion tools have become tools for promoting "liberalization." Some school lecterns have become platforms for "liberalization" advocates. Some articles and works have distorted the glorious history of the Chinese people's struggle for national independence and national prosperity since the May Fourth Movement, portraying it as a history of repeatedly taking the wrong path and falling into new states of slavery, while portraying the West as a "paradise" of spiritual civilization and extolling the wonders and beauty of Western-style "democracy and freedom." Otherwise, how could so many politically naive and impractical political incitements during this student unrest so easily stir a group of inexperienced students into a frenzy?

The Consequences of Weakened Ideological and Political Work

In recent years, there has been an abnormal phenomenon in the entire society, especially in institutions of higher learning, of downplaying and denying ideological and political education work. Some people even advocate abolishing the cadre team for political work. The system and network of ideological and political work for college students have not received due attention, and ideological and political work for college students has become merely a matter for party and league organizations and student work departments, and a matter for political work cadres. There has been a difficult situation of "theory not working, status not high, team not stable, work not effective, results not good." Ideological and political work has been "reformed" to the point of almost losing all the fine traditions of the Party's ideological and political work, without forming new effective methods of ideological and political work. As a result, the role of the Party has been seriously downplayed, and the authority of ideological and political work has been lost. Subject teachers and cadres look down on ideological and political work, and political work cadres look down on their own jobs. Political work cadres often look for backdoors and escape routes, with some leaving and others scattering. Some people have described this as the "great escape of political work cadres"!

On the other hand, some teaching faculty members act irresponsibly on the lectern, freely expressing themselves, catering to students' preferences, and indoctrinating students with issues and incorrect viewpoints that are under discussion, causing confusion in students' thoughts. Some schools have lost vigilance against those who advocate bourgeois liberalization, allowing them to freely operate within the school, spreading bourgeois liberalization through school lecterns, salons, gatherings, and other means. Even worse, some schools offer high salaries to hire those "elites" who advocate bourgeois liberalization, placing them on the university lectern, giving them a legal status, and spreading speeches that negate socialism and advocate capitalism. Some comrades have sharply pointed out that if this continues, our universities will cultivate their own gravediggers.

Summarizing the lessons from college students' participation in the student unrest and turmoil, we cannot help but recall the prediction made by Western politicians in the early 1950s that the hope for the restoration of capitalism in China was placed on the third and fourth generations of the Chinese Communist Party, which makes us break out in a cold sweat. The severe lessons tell us that we should do two things: first, strengthen ideological education for young students and genuinely guide young students to follow the Party and walk the socialist path; second, purify the social environment in which young students grow up, strive to eliminate the pollution of bourgeois decadent thoughts, and make socialist universities a stronghold for cultivating the "four haves" new people.

### 为何那么多大学生被卷入动乱？

    为何那么多大学生被卷入动乱？
    共青团山东省委学校部　林建华
    历时两个多月、经过了学潮——动乱——暴乱的政治风波虽已经平息，但血的教训给人们留下了许许多多值得思索的问题。为什么当这场政治风波来临时，会有那么多大学生自觉或不自觉地加入或卷入这场学潮、动乱中去？当我们研究分析了大学生参与学潮、动乱的主客观原因之后，就会看到这场风波的到来是不可避免的，大学生被卷入风波也是在所难免的。
      爱国热情误导到自由化的歧路
    当代大学生是“生在十年动乱时期，长在拨乱反正时期，学在改革开放时期”的一代。这种特殊的环境，使当代大学生形成了许多可贵的优点，他们知识面广，思想敏锐，拥护改革，反对守旧，渴求知识，立志成才；但是也存在不少明显的不可忽视的缺点和弱点，这些缺点和弱点在这场非常复杂的动乱中暴露得非常充分。他们自身充满着各种矛盾，虽然有着许多良好的愿望和要求，但总不能同正确的行为相统一，所以往往被一些别有用心的人所利用，而酿造出沉痛的悲剧。
    第一，他们有爱国热情，但缺乏坚定正确的政治方向。学潮、动乱的事实使我们看到，许多大学生的失误，不在于他们爱国热情太高，问题在于这种爱国热情没有建立在科学的基础上，没有正确的政治方向。一个时期以来，许多大学生忽视了自身的政治修养，放松了对马列主义的学习，对形势教育课、政治理论课兴趣淡漠，缺课现象普遍，久而久之，导致了对党的信念的动摇、对马列主义的信仰危机，不但不能抵御政治上的细菌和毒草，反而会把资产阶级那一套当做兴国、强国的灵丹妙药。在这种情况下，没有正确政治方向的朴素的爱国热情，不能不被一小撮打着爱国旗号而搞资产阶级自由化的人所利用。而这种热情越浓烈，就越会陷入更深的泥潭之中。
          以不民主的方式要求民主
    第二，他们有民主意识，但缺乏较好的民主素质和法纪观念。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国的民主建设不断发展，在这种良好的环境中，大学生的民主愿望和民主意识不断发展，民主意识越来越强。但是，随着大学生民主意识的增强，他们适应民主生活的素质和法纪观念并没有相应地增强。他们很少有机会进行民主生活的训练，不知道应在法纪范围内推进民主，通过正当的民主渠道和民主形式反映民主要求。其结果，往往是民主的要求和不民主的行为同时出现。在有强烈的民主意识而无民主生活素质和法纪观念的情况下进行所谓的民主活动，往往严重影响别人的民主权利，干扰了正常的学习、工作、生活和社会秩序。在学潮中，许多学生任意攻击各级人代会、党代会选举的党政领导人，冲击有关部门，他们完全把自己摆在了“特殊公民”的位置上。
    第三，他们有参与要求，但缺乏参与社会事务的能力和政治经验。大学生绝大多数是从学校到学校、没有经过什么风浪的单纯学生，对我国的国情没有全面的认识，对社会的体察和理解也不全面，更缺乏应付复杂社会局面的能力。所以大学生在校期间，应当是学习和准备参与社会的时期，而不能作为以社会活动为主的时期。在学潮中，许多大学生并没有充分的思想准备，而盲目地进行参与，幻想在参与中扬名全省、全国，实现自身的价值。他们表现出了政治上的极端幼稚，不能冷静、理智地分析问题和考虑后果，而不明不白地成为那些政治阴谋家的“人质”和“枪头”，直至走向错误的深渊。
          一意孤行地张扬个性
    第四，他们有自立的愿望，但缺乏实事求是自我解剖的精神。一个时期以来，大学生受到社会的宠爱。对来自社会的赞誉，许多大学生没有把此当作党和人民的期望和鞭策，而是陶醉了，飘飘然了。他们不能实事求是地进行自我认识，而是盲目地过高估计自己。这就导致他们脱离工农群众，不能正确地向社会学习，向历史学习，向老一辈革命家学习，形成了一种“普天之下舍我其谁”的心态。这种心态同要求自主自立的愿望融合在一起，就不可能不产生偏执的行为。在学潮中，他们听不进党和政府的规劝，认为他们的个性和自立要求受到了压制，一意孤行，这就必然离党和人民的要求越来越远了。
    第五，他们有历史责任感，但缺乏艰苦奋斗的思想和严格的道德修养，忽视了对自己的严格要求和刻苦磨砺。在学潮中，有些大学生就直言不讳地说，罢课、罢考、空校就是为了厌恶和逃避艰苦的学习。有的学生把心中的不满发泄在对国家财物、对学校公共设施的破坏上，发泄在对学校领导和老师的谩骂上，表现了非常低下的道德水平。实践证明这些学生最容易被极端无政府主义所影响，而卷入学潮和动乱。
    大学生自身的弱点、缺点是他们走上失误的重要原因，但外部条件和环境对他们产生了一些什么影响，不能不使我们进行冷静的反思。一个时期以来，大学生所处的客观环境出现了许许多多的不正常现象，资产阶级自由化的东西包围了他们，而又没有强有力的措施使他们摆脱这种影响。这种不良的环境同大学生自身的弱点结合在一起，使他们本来就不太坚定的信念、立场和态度发生了严重的倾斜。
    近几年来，资产阶级自由化思潮的逆流不但没有受到遏制，相反地愈益发展以致泛滥成灾。一些宣传舆论工具成为宣传“自由化”的工具，一些学校的讲台成了“自由化”人士的讲台。一些文章、著作把“五四”以来中国人民为民族独立、国家富强奋斗的光辉历史，丑化为不断走错道路、不断走入新的被奴役状况的历史，而把西方渲染成精神文明的“天堂”，把西方式的“民主自由”宣传得如何奇妙美好。不然的话，此次学潮中许多实际上是极其幼稚而脱离实际的政治鼓动，怎么会这样容易地把一群缺乏经验的莘莘学子们鼓动得如醉如狂呢？
        思想政治工作大削弱的恶果
    近几年来，在整个社会，特别是高等院校，出现了淡化和否定思想政治教育工作的反常现象，有人甚至主张取消政工干部队伍。高校学生的思想政治工作的体系和网络建设得不到应有的重视，高校学生的思想政治工作成了只是党团组织和学生工作部门的事情，只是政工人员的事情，出现了“理论不灵、地位不高、队伍不稳、工作不力、效果不好”的艰难情况。思想政治工作“改造”来“改造”去，把党的思想政治工作的优良传统快丢光了，而没有形成新的行之有效的思想政治工作的新方法。结果严重淡化了党的作用，丧失了思想政治工作的威信。业务教师和干部鄙视思想政治工作，政工干部轻视自己的本职工作。政工干部往往留后路、找出路，走的走、散的散，有的人形容这是“政工干部胜利大逃亡”！
    另一方面，一些任课教师在讲台上不负责任，自由发挥，投学生所好，把一些正在讨论的问题和不正确的观点当作教授的内容灌输给学生，引起了学生思想上的混乱。有的学校对那些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人失去警觉，让他们在学校随意活动，通过学校的讲台、沙龙、集会等传播资产阶级自由化思潮。更有甚者，有的学校出高薪聘请那些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的“精英”们，把他们敬在大学的讲坛上，让他们取得合法地位，散布否定社会主义、鼓吹资本主义的言论。有的同志曾尖锐地指出，这样下去，我们的大学就会培养出我们自己的掘墓人。
    总结大学生参与学潮和动乱的教训，不禁使我们回想起50年代初西方政治家曾把中国复辟资本主义的希望寄托在中国党第三代、第四代人身上的预言，使我们惊出一身冷汗。严重的教训告诉我们，我们应当做好两方面的工作：一是要加强对青年学生的思想教育，切实引导青年学生跟党走，走社会主义道路；二是要净化青年学生成长的社会环境，努力消除资产阶级腐朽思想的污染，把社会主义的高校办成培养“四有”新人的坚强阵地。
