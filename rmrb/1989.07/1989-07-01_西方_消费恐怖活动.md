A mother in the UK was feeding her 9-month-old daughter baby food produced by Hans Baby Food Company. Suddenly, the baby started crying. The mother noticed blood seeping from her daughter's mouth and was puzzled. She discovered a broken piece of a knife blade in the pear puree. Then, she found a piece of tape in another bottle of pear puree with the words "Do Not Use" written on it. A few days later, someone else found similar foreign objects in the same brand of pear puree.

Customers rushed to the supermarket where the pear puree was sold, demanding refunds, compensation, and explanations. The supermarket contacted Hans Company, which agreed to recall all pear puree and other baby food products from the shelves. The company had just received an anonymous phone call: 1 million pounds must be delivered to a specified location by a certain time, otherwise, poison would continue to be placed in the company's baby food products and the media would be notified.

Hans Company is just one of the victims of Western consumer terrorism. This term refers to the practice of some individuals placing foreign objects or poisons in food or other consumer goods to extort money from food or other consumer goods producers and sellers. Consumer terrorism has a history of 7 years, originating in the United States. In 1982, Johnson & Johnson's "Tylenol" brand painkillers were laced with cyanide, killing 8 people in Chicago who took the drug, resulting in a $400 million loss for the company. In 1984, consumer terrorists laced "Girl Scouts" brand cookies with nails, thumbtacks, and glass shards. The same year, consumer terrorism spread to Japan, affecting two major candy companies and two food companies. In recent years, 31 companies in Japan have been affected by consumer terrorism, with 5 companies going bankrupt. In 1985, 8 Japanese people died after drinking juice laced with herbicide, causing Japanese consumers to fear drinking juice. The UK first experienced consumer terrorism in 1984, with Mars Company suffering heavy losses after being informed that its products were laced with rat poison. In 1986, Bernard Matthews Company's turkey burgers were laced with mercury, and the extortionists demanded a large sum of money. In 1987, the Safe Road Company, a supermarket chain famous in the British Isles, had its food products laced with herbicide, arsenic, and broken glass, with the poisoners demanding 40,000 pounds. In the summer of 1988, a British pet food company was demanded 500,000 pounds. The police set a trap using 20,000 pounds as bait, and the extortionists miraculously withdrew 18,000 pounds from the designated bank and escaped. This year, after Hans Company was affected, the British Bovril Food Company's minced mutton also became a target of consumer terrorists, who laced the minced mutton with glass shards, causing the company's products to be shunned for a time. Southern Europe also saw the presence of consumer terrorists. In 1988, someone injected poison into fruits sold in the Italian market, forcing the Italian government to ban the sale of grapes.

This spring, consumer terrorism reached a new high in the United States, with terrorists injecting cyanide into grapes imported from Chile. The US government ordered the immediate destruction of all Chilean grapes and banned the import of grapes from Chile, resulting in the unemployment of 20,000 grape workers in Chile and the destruction of 3.5 million boxes of grapes, causing a loss of $240 million. In addition to the above consumer terrorism incidents, there have been countless similar events in the West, and many consumers are living in fear.

Faced with such rampant consumer terrorism, Western governments have taken strict measures to crack down on and prevent such immoral activities, and some terrorists have been apprehended. Anti-terrorism experts believe that the most effective preventive measures may need to be implemented by commodity producers, sellers, and consumers. For example, producers must strictly control the manufacturing, packaging, and transportation processes, prohibiting unauthorized personnel from contacting consumer goods; sellers must strengthen surveillance, use video surveillance in supermarkets, and increase undercover personnel; consumers should report any suspicious activities immediately. Producers and sellers receiving extortion notices should not give in, try to stall the other party, and quickly contact the police.

    西方“消费恐怖活动”
    南北
    英国一位母亲正在给她9个月的女儿喂汉斯儿童食品公司生产的酸梨酱。突然，女儿哇哇大哭起来。母亲看见女儿的嘴渗出了鲜血，感到十分奇怪。她发现酸梨酱中有一块断刀片。接着，她又从另一瓶酸梨酱中找出了一块胶布，上面写着“顾客勿用”字样。几天后，又有人从这种酸梨酱中发现了类似的异物。
    顾客纷纷涌到出售这种酸梨酱的超级市场，要求退货、赔偿损失并作出解释。超级市场找到了汉斯公司，汉斯公司答应从货架上收回所有酸梨酱和该公司生产的其它儿童食品，因为公司刚刚接到一个匿名电话：必须按时将100万英镑送到指定地点，否则继续在该公司生产的儿童食品中放毒并通知报界。
    汉斯公司只是西方消费恐怖活动的受害者之一。所谓消费恐怖活动，即一些人通过在食物或其它消费品中投放异物、毒素等手段，向食物或其它消费品生产者和销售者敲诈金钱的勾当。消费恐怖活动至今已有7年历史，最初起源于美国。1982年，美国约翰逊泰勒诺尔公司生产的“泰勒诺尔”牌头痛药被人涂抹了剧毒氰化物，芝加哥有8人因服用这种药致死，该公司损失4亿美元。1984年，消费恐怖分子又在美国“女童子军”牌面包中掺杂了钉书钉、大头钉和玻璃片。同一年，消费恐怖活动蔓延到日本，两家主要糖果公司和两家食品公司受到敲诈。近几年来，日本有31家公司受到消费恐怖活动影响，5家公司因此而破产。1985年，8名日本人因饮用投有除草剂的果汁死亡，致使日本消费者一度谈论果汁而色变。英国于1984年首次出现消费恐怖活动，玛尔斯公司因有人告知其产品中放有鼠药而损失惨重。1986年，伯纳德马修斯公司生产的火鸡汉堡包中被人掺上了水银，敲诈者向该公司索要了大笔英镑。1987年，名扬英伦三岛的超级市场集团公司安全道路公司所销售的食品中被人掺杂了除草剂、砒霜和碎玻璃，放毒者要价4万英镑。1988年夏天，英国的一家动物食品公司被人索要50万英镑，警方派出数千名侦探设下陷阱，用两万英镑作诱饵，结果被敲诈者奇迹般地从其指定的银行取走了其中的1.8万英镑而逃之夭夭。今年，继汉斯公司受害之后，英国的牛—门食品公司生产的羊肉酱也成了消费恐怖分子的猎物，他们在羊肉酱中撒上了玻璃碴，致使该公司的产品一度无人问津。南欧也出现了消费恐怖分子的行踪。1988年，有人用针头在意大利市场上出售的水果中注射了毒素，意大利政府被迫禁止销售葡萄。
    今年春天，消费恐怖活动在美国掀起了新的高潮，恐怖分子在从智利进口的葡萄中注射了氰化物。美国政府下令立即销毁所有智利葡萄，并禁止从智利进口葡萄，致使智利的两万名葡萄工人失业，350万箱葡萄被销毁，损失高达2.4亿美元。除了以上消费恐怖活动之外，在西方，其它类似事件无以数计，许多消费者提心吊胆。
    面对如此猖獗的消费恐怖活动，西方各国政府采取了严厉措施打击和防范此类缺德分子，一些恐怖分子相继落网。反恐怖活动专家认为，最有效的防范措施也许要靠商品生产者、销售者和消费者去实行。比如，生产者在制作、包装和储运过程中要严格把关，禁止无关人员接触消费品；销售者要加强监视，在超级市场上采用录像监视，增加便衣；消费者发现情况，要立即报案。生产者和销售者接到讹诈通知，切勿妥协，要设法拖住对方，尽快与警方联系等。
