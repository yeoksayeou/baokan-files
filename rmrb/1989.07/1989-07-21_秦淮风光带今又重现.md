The scenic Qinhuai River area, once renowned as the "land of six dynasties' golden dust," has been restored to its former glory. Starting from November 1st this year, the Qinhuai River scenic area will be open to the public as a national key tourist attraction.

The Qinhuai River scenic area, with the Confucius Temple as its center and the Qinhuai River as its axis, connects various scenic spots along the river. Historically, this area has been a bustling place and a favorite subject for poets and scholars throughout the dynasties. In 1937, after the Japanese invaders occupied Nanjing, most of the buildings were reduced to ashes. In 1985, the restoration and reconstruction began. Over the past four years, approximately 100 million yuan has been invested, accounting for 80% of the total investment in scenic spot construction in Jiangsu Province. Currently, the daily visitor flow in this area averages over 200,000 people.

    秦淮风光带今又重现
    新华社南京电  （记者李巍）昔日以“六朝金粉”地著称的南京秦淮风光带如今重现。今年十一月一日起，秦淮风光带将作为全国重点旅游景点对外开放。
    秦淮风光带以夫子庙为中心、秦淮河为纽带，串联沿河景点。这里历史上就是比较繁华的地方，也是历代文人墨客吟诗赋词的对象。一九三七年日本侵略军占领南京后，大部分建筑付之一炬。一九八五年开始规划修复。四年来共投资约一亿元，占江苏全省景点建设投资的百分之八十。目前这一地区日人流量平均二十多万人次。
