Last year marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of American playwright Eugene O'Neill, and people around the world who love his dramas were commemorating him.

Born and died in an inn, now resting in a grove of oaks in a cemetery in the southern suburbs of Boston, O'Neill would never have known about the current commemorations of him. However, this commemoration is undoubtedly sacred for the living: people recall his tumultuous experiences, his dramas, and the precious philosophy and insights contained within his dramas.

Last year, during the first half of the year, while I was at Harvard University, I visited Provincetown in New England's Cape Cod with my American friend, Professor Berlin from Columbia University. Provincetown is a charming small town where American writers and artists gather, lying on the edge of the setting sun's sail shadows.

I walked through white-painted wooden fences and a cluster of willows that drooped to the ground, arriving at 571 Commercial Street, the former residence of American writer John Dos Passos. Climbing the carpeted stairs, I walked from the living room to the outside, and beyond the trellis covered in ivy, I saw a white balcony, a golden beach, and a blue sea. The balcony was large; Dos Passos and Hemingway had dined here together. In those days, the balcony was connected to the abandoned Lewis Wharf in the sea by fishermen. Eugene O'Neill's one-act play "Bound East for Cardiff," which describes the death of a sailor, was performed in the summer of 1916 in a dilapidated house on this wharf by the amateur "Provincetown Players" theater group, composed of writers, playwrights, and actors. This place became the birthplace of modern American theater.

The door of the boathouse by the sea was opened, using the real sea as a backdrop, and a drama about the sea and death was performed. Sailors, the fate of death—the reality of the drama, and the wharf, boathouse, sea, and fog of Provincetown—the reality of life, merged into one.

Playwright Susan Glaspell recalled the scene of that performance in "The Road to the Temple": "As the script required, it was foggy that day, and the foghorn sounded from the harbor. The tide was high, and the waves splashed below and around us, splashing up through the holes in the floor. This background gave us a rhythm and mood of the sea."

However, Lewis Wharf no longer exists, fire and waves have engulfed it, just as fate has engulfed death, leaving not even a trace. I stood on the balcony, thinking of this playwright who was described by the Nobel Committee as "expressing in his dramatic works force, passion, and deep feeling, which completely conform to the original concept of tragedy." I thought of his "Long Day's Journey into Night," written with "tears and blood," using his family's summer residence, the Monte Cristo Cottage, which stands by the Thames River in New London, as the backdrop. With "deep compassion, understanding, and forgiveness," he analyzed the weaknesses and misfortunes in the personalities of his family members: his miserly father who was a star actor, his mother who was addicted to drugs, his brother who was an alcoholic, and himself who had tuberculosis. American poet T.S. Eliot thought this was "the most moving play he had ever seen."

O'Neill used to live at 577 Commercial Street in the so-called "Francis Apartments." He hung a sign on his door that read, "Go to hell," declining social invitations and focusing on writing and marathon swimming. He was the "son of the great mother sea." I particularly enjoy reading his works, feeling a kind of "primitive beauty of rhythm" and a sense of intimacy. He advocated struggling with eternal adversity, "any life worth living is dedicated to the effort to realize some dream." It is with this restless value that he imbued life with a dream.

Mrs. Pavlenti, the director of the Eugene O'Neill Homestead Museum in New London, told me in the living room of the Monte Cristo Cottage that a small theater troupe in San Francisco would perform O'Neill's "sea dramas" on a 17th-century sailing ship that transported wood, with the audience romantically seated on the deck or lower deck to watch the performance.

O'Neill said: "Perhaps a person's tragedy is the only meaningful thing. What I pursue is to make the audience leave the theater with a sense of ecstasy because they have seen someone on stage confronting life and struggling with eternal fate—not conquering, perhaps ultimately being conquered—making personal life more meaningful through this struggle."

If the ordinary audience on the sailing ship, like the audience at Lewis Wharf in those days, can leave the theater with this sense of ecstasy, I think this would be the best and most eternal commemoration of O'Neill.

    小镇·海·戏剧
    朱世达
    去年是美国戏剧家尤金·奥尼尔诞辰一百周年，全世界热爱他的戏剧的人们都在纪念他。
    诞生与逝世于客栈、现安躺在波士顿南郊墓园橡树丛中的奥尼尔是不可能知道时下人们对他的纪念了。但这种纪念，对于活着的人们，对于喜爱和研究奥尼尔戏剧的人们，却无疑是神圣的：人们回忆他的坎坷的经历，他的戏剧，他的戏剧中所饱含的可贵的哲理与启示。
    去年上半年，我在哈佛大学时，在美国朋友、哥伦比亚大学客座教授伯林先生陪同下，去了新英格兰鳕鱼角普罗文斯镇——美国作家与艺术家聚居的躺在落日帆影边上的美妙小镇。
    我穿过白漆的木栅栏和一丛垂至地面的柽柳，来到商业街571号，美国作家多斯·帕索斯的故居。上了铺地毯的楼，从客厅往外走，在爬满长青藤的栅栏外，迎面便是雪白的阳台、金色的海滩、蓝的海。阳台很大，多斯·帕索斯和海明威曾在这儿一起用过餐；当年阳台与海中被渔民废弃的刘易斯码头相连。尤金·奥尼尔描写水手之死的独幕剧《东航卡狄夫》，1916年夏天就是在这码头上的破屋里，由作家、剧作家、演员组成的业余的“普罗文斯镇剧团”演出，这儿成了美国现代戏剧的发祥地。
    船屋临海的门打开，以真实的海作背景，演出了一出关于海和死亡的戏剧。水手、死亡的命运——戏剧的真实，和普罗文斯镇的码头、船屋、海、雾——生活的真实，融而为一。
    剧作家苏珊·格拉斯帕尔在《前往庙宇之路》中回忆那次上演的情景：“正如剧本所要求的，那天有雾，港口传来雾笛。涨潮了，潮水在我们下面和周围拍打，从地板的洞眼里溅上来。这背景正给我们一种海的节奏和情调。”
    然而，刘易斯码头已不复存在了，火和浪吞没了它，就像命运吞没了死亡一样，连痕迹也已被海水冲荡殆尽了。我站在阳台上，想到这位被诺贝尔奖委员会称为“在剧作中表现了力量、热忱和诚挚的感情——它们完全符合悲剧的原始概念”的剧作家，想到他以新伦敦他家的基度山庄——那白漆的、临泰姆河而立的夏日寓所——为背景的用“泪和血”写的《长夜路迢》，他以“深深的怜悯，谅解和宽恕的心情”剖析他亲人人格上的弱点与不幸：吝啬的为明星演员的父亲，吸毒的母亲，酗酒成性的哥哥和生肺病的自己。美国诗人T·S·爱略特认为这是他“所看过的最动人的戏了。”
    奥尼尔当年就住在商业街577号所谓的“弗兰西斯公寓”。他在房门上挂一个牌：“滚你的蛋”，谢绝社交，专事写作和马拉松式的游泳，他是“大海母亲的儿子”。我非常喜欢读他的作品，觉得有一种“原始的美的节奏”，一种亲切感。他主张与永恒的逆境搏斗，“任何值得生活的生命在于致力实现某种梦的努力之中”。他就是这样赋以生命的梦以这样躁动的价值。
    新伦敦剧作家故居博物馆主任帕凡蒂夫人在基度山庄的客厅里告诉我，旧金山有一家小剧团将在渔夫码头一艘十七世纪运木头的纵帆船上演出奥尼尔的“海洋戏剧”，观众富有浪漫色彩地坐在船头或下甲板上观剧。
    奥尼尔说：“人的悲剧也许是他唯一有意义的东西。我所追求的是让观众离开剧场时，有一种因为见到有人在舞台上直面人生、与永恒的命运搏斗——不是征服，也许最终被征服——而产生的狂喜感情。个人的生命正因为这种斗争而变得更有意义。”
    如果纵帆船上的那些普通的观众和当年刘易斯码头的观众一样，能带着这种狂喜感情而离开剧场，我想，这是对奥尼尔最好的、永恒的纪念了。　　　（题图为刘易斯码头）
