Over the past three years, Xinghua City in Jiangsu Province has been working to address corruption within its party and government agencies. By starting from practical issues, they have gradually formulated some anti-corruption regulations that are feasible and can be monitored, creating a relatively good atmosphere throughout the city.

In recent years, party and government officials in Xinghua City have had prominent issues with housing, promotions, banquets, having a second child, and selling products, known as the "five issues" of "housing, position, banquet, child, and money." Particularly, the misuse of public funds for banquets has been widespread. Officials from municipal agencies, when visiting villages, would demand food and drinks, and village officials would also have lavish banquets during their work in villages. For example, in Xiaogu Village of Xiaowei Township and Tangjia Village and Jujia Village of Lintan Township, over 22,000 yuan was spent on public banquets in just two years, causing strong public dissatisfaction and tense relations between officials and the people. These issues have alerted the municipal committee, which has decided to address them seriously. They have investigated and punished typical units in both urban and rural areas for excessive banquets, ordering the relevant units and individuals to return the banquet funds within a specified time and reporting the cases throughout the city. While these measures have had some effect, they soon realized that relying solely on investigations and education cannot fundamentally solve the problem. The misuse of public funds for banquets and other improper practices continued to occur, with new methods constantly emerging, resulting in a situation where addressing one issue would lead to another popping up, making it difficult to effectively control these improper practices.

Investigations were conducted strictly, and ideological education was not neglected, but why did the improper practices of banquets and other issues persist despite being banned and corrected? This led the municipal committee to think more deeply about the problem. They calmly analyzed the causes and found that while measures were taken to investigate and punish improper practices after the fact, there were no preventive measures in place. While ideological education for party members and officials was emphasized, there was a lack of behavioral regulations and a solid institutional barrier. Therefore, to rectify party and government conduct, it is not enough to focus on investigations and education; institutional building is equally important.

In the process of promoting anti-corruption institutional building, the CPC Committee of Xinghua City focused on transparency and supervision, using transparency to ensure and achieve supervision, and closely integrating administrative transparency with democratic supervision to form an effective check on power.

Since last year, they have selected 16 municipal departments to pilot administrative transparency. Through documents, meetings, newspapers, radio, and broadcasts, they have published procedures, processes, personnel, deadlines, and results for handling matters, making it clear to the public what can and cannot be done, who to approach, how to handle it, and the outcomes. This has changed the previous practices of delaying and arbitrarily changing policies, effectively preventing improper practices. The Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce, in response to issues such as handling "favor cases," accepting "favor fees," and issuing "favor certificates," reformed the handling procedures and insisted on implementing "five transparencies": transparency in the bureau's organizational structure and functions; transparency in the "ten prohibitions" work discipline for the industrial and commercial system; transparency in the conditions, procedures, approval authority, time limits, and results for registration and issuance of licenses; transparency in the standards for collecting individual management fees and market management fees; and transparency in the hotline for reporting and supervision. This effectively plugged loopholes and improved the atmosphere. Statistics show that in 1988, the entire system had 477 instances of officials refusing invitations, 6545 yuan in refused gifts, earning praise from the public. By the end of last year, the entire city had implemented "four transparencies" in rural townships: transparency in farmers' burdens, distribution of agricultural materials, rural financial management, and contract management of sideline industries. This has mobilized farmers' production enthusiasm, promoted officials' integrity, and improved relations between officials and the people.

To establish and improve the supervision system, first, enhance party supervision. In 1987, the municipal committee formulated the "Several Regulations on Strengthening Party Supervision," and recently established and improved the party conduct responsibility system, democratic life meeting system, and democratic evaluation of party members system, further enhancing party supervision. Second, strengthen administrative supervision. At the beginning of this year, the Municipal Supervision Bureau appointed 105 part-time supervisors in various administrative agencies across the city and 25 special supervisors from the Municipal People's Congress, Political Consultative Conference, and retired cadres, effectively strengthening administrative supervision. Third, pay attention to public supervision. Since July last year, the entire city has established three reporting centers for economic crimes, economic law violations, and price law violations, setting up more than 20 reporting hotlines, encouraging the public to report on the corruption of party and government officials. So far, 314 cases of various types have been accepted, and 240 have been investigated and concluded. Many units have also set up reporting boxes, suggestion boxes, and supervision hotlines to accept public supervision. Fourth, strengthen media supervision. Since last year, the "Xinghua Daily" has publicly exposed various corruption cases 149 times, including 13 involving municipal party and government officials, effectively restraining some officials' illegal and disciplinary actions.

Strictly enforcing discipline and seriously investigating and punishing illegal and disciplinary cases is an important link in ensuring the implementation of various anti-corruption regulations. The municipal committee has handled public reports of disciplinary issues with evidence-based discipline, standardized penalties, fair handling, and timely investigation. By the end of last year, during the party conduct evaluation, someone reported that a deputy district head in Laowei District had built a house with excessive land and area. The Supervision Bureau, after investigation, found the report to be true. However, some people spoke for him, saying that the comrade was young and worked well, and the punishment could be lighter; others said that he had not exceeded the standard by much, and a self-criticism would suffice, without needing to return the land or demolish the excess. But the municipal committee, despite interference, followed the regulations and gave the comrade an administrative warning, reported it throughout the city, and publicly exposed it in the newspaper. At the same time, they ordered him to return the excess residential land and demolish the nearly 10 square meters of excess housing. In the past three years, they have investigated and dealt with 16 disciplinary cases involving deputy bureau (township) level and above leaders, and this year, they have investigated and dealt with 4 more cases, educating and shocking a wide range of officials and the public, maintaining the seriousness of the regulations.

Xinghua City has combined the investigation of cases with the establishment of regulations, using the investigation of a case to address a category of problems. In Chengbao Village of Dongtan Township on the outskirts of the city, land was illegally sold to outsiders to build houses, causing strong public dissatisfaction. To quickly investigate and punish this case and stop the improper practice of building houses in violation of regulations in the suburbs, the municipal committee decided to have a municipal committee member and a deputy mayor lead a special team. Through in-depth investigation and evidence collection, they finally clarified the facts and promptly handled the case. After the meeting, the urban construction, land management, and public security departments conducted a comprehensive inspection and cleanup of the planning, land, and household registration management of the suburban towns and villages, and formulated and improved relevant management regulations.

    建立严实的屏障
    ——江苏省兴化市委探索廉政建设的路子
    仲吉宗　苏兴
    3年多来，江苏省兴化市为了解决党政机关中的腐败现象，从实际出发，逐步制订了一些能实现、可检查的廉政制度，在全市形成比较好的气候。
    前些年，兴化市党政干部在住房、提拔调动、吃喝、生二胎、推销产品，即“房子、位子、杯子、儿子、票子”等方面存在着一些比较突出的问题，特别是用公款吃喝问题比较普遍。机关干部下乡要吃要喝，区乡干部在村里工作也有大吃大喝的现象。下圩乡小顾村和林潭乡唐家村、锯家村两年时间用公款吃喝开支达2.2万多元，群众反映强烈，干群关系紧张。这些问题引起了市委的警觉，决心认真加以解决。他们分别在城乡对大吃大喝的典型单位进行了严肃查处，责令有关单位和个人限期交清吃喝款，并在全市通报。这样做，虽然收到了一定的效果，但他们很快就发现，单靠查处和教育并不能从根本上解决问题，用公款吃喝的现象仍然时有发生，而且手法不断变换，结果是按下葫芦浮起瓢，用公款吃喝等不正之风没有能得到有效的控制。
    查处不可谓不严，思想教育也未曾放松，吃喝等问题上的不正之风为什么总是禁而不止，纠而复生？这就引起了市委对问题的更深的思考。他们冷静地分析了原因，过去对不正之风虽然事后查处抓得紧，但事前防范无措施；对党员干部思想教育抓得紧，但在行为规范上无约束，缺少一道严实的制度屏障。因此，要端正党风、政风，不仅要抓查处、抓教育，更重要的是要抓制度建设。
    在推进廉政制度建设的过程中，兴化市委紧紧抓住公开、监督这两个关键，用公开来保证和实现监督，把政务公开与民主监督紧密结合起来，形成对权力的有效制衡。
    去年以来，他们选择了市直16个部门进行政务公开试点，通过文件、会议、报纸、电台、广播等多种形式公布办事规则、办事程序、办事人员、办事期限、办事结果等，使群众知道哪些事能办，哪些事不能办，找谁办，如何办，办的结果怎样，从而改变了过去办事拖拉、随意改变政策的现象，有效地防止了不正之风。市工商局针对本部门存在办“人情案”、收“人情费”、发“人情照”的现象，改革办事制度，坚持实行“五公开”：即公开本局机构设置及职能；公开工商系统人员“十不准”的工作纪律；公开登记发照的条件、手续程序、审批权限、时限和结果；公开个体管理费、市场管理费的收费标准；公开举报、监督电话，有效地堵塞了漏洞，促进了风气的好转。据统计，1988年全系统干部拒绝吃请477人次，拒收礼品6545元，得到群众的赞誉。去年年底，全市在农村乡镇普遍实行了农民负担、农用物资分配、农村财务管理和工副业承包“四公开”，从而调动了农民的生产积极性，促进了干部的廉洁，改善了干群关系。
    建立健全监督体系，一是完善党内监督，1987年，市委研究制定了《关于加强党内监督的若干规定》，最近又建立健全了党风责任制、民主生活会制度、民主评议党员制度等，进一步完善了党内监督，二是强化行政监督，今年初，市监察局在全市各行政机关中聘任了105名兼职监察员，在市人大、政协和离休干部中聘请了25名特邀监察员，有效地加强了行政监督；三是重视群众监督。去年7月以来，全市先后建立了经济罪案、经济违法案件、物价违法案件等三个举报中心，设立了20多个举报电话，鼓励群众对党政机关干部的不廉洁问题进行检举。到目前，共受理各类举报314起，已查结240起。不少单位还通过设立举报箱、意见箱、监督电话等，接受群众监督。四是加强新闻舆论监督，去年以来，《兴化报》公开披露各种腐败现象149次，其中有关市属党政干部的13次，有效地制约了一些干部的违章违纪行为。
    从严执纪，严肃查处违法乱纪案件，是保证各项廉政制度执行的重要环节。市委对群众揭发的违纪问题，做到执纪有据，量纪规范，办案公正，查处及时。去年底，在党风测评中，有人反映老圩区一副区长建房多占地、超面积。监察局经过调查，发现情况属实。但有些人为他讲话，说该同志年轻、工作不错，处分可以轻一点；还有的说他超标准不多，检讨一下算了，不必让地、拆除。但市委排除干扰，按照规定，对该同志给予了行政警告处分，通报全市，并在报纸上公开披露。同时责令其退出了多占的宅基地，拆除了超标准的近10平方米住房。前3年，他们先后查处了副局（乡）级以上领导干部违纪案件16件，今年又查处了4件，使广大干部群众受到了教育和震动，维护了制度的严肃性。
    兴化市把查处案件和建立制度结合起来，通过查处一起案件，处理好一类问题。城郊东潭乡城堡村非法出卖土地给外来户建房，群众反映强烈。为了迅速查处这起案件，刹住违反规定在城郊建房的歪风，市委决定由一名市委常委、一名副市长挂帅，组织专门班子，通过深入调查取证，终于查清了事实，迅速作了处理。会后，城建、土管、公安等部门对城郊乡村的规划、土地、户口三大管理部门进行全面检查清理，并制定和完善了有关管理规定。
