During the period of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, all Party members, cadres, and staff of the Cui Ming Zhuang Guesthouse of the Central Organization Department of the Communist Party of China stood up at a critical moment when the martial law troops were surrounded and blocked, rescuing, protecting, and taking care of 220 soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army.

On the early morning of June 3, 220 soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the martial law troops were surrounded and blocked by a group of thugs and uninformed masses while advancing towards Tiananmen Square. They retreated to the outer wall of the Cui Ming Zhuang Guesthouse of the Central Organization Department, with some soldiers injured. At this time, the gate of the guesthouse to the north crossroad was blocked by the crowd, creating a chaotic scene with shouting and cursing. The soldiers and officers were tightly surrounded by the wall, unable to advance or retreat, in a very dangerous situation. The female Communist Party member on night duty, Meng Qingchao, received instructions from the leaders of the Central Organization Department and, at the risk of her life, bravely and wisely went out several times to find the unit leaders and negotiate with the students and the masses. At the same time, she organized a protection team and quickly moved the besieged martial law troops into the guesthouse to rest.

After the soldiers and officers entered the courtyard, the guesthouse was still surrounded, with noise and banging on the door outside, and the courtyard was in danger of being stormed at any time. The Party branch of the guesthouse successively took in 3 scattered and injured soldiers; covered the troops' communication with superiors; and closely cooperated with the police to clear out the intruders in the courtyard, taking measures to strengthen the defense inside and outside the courtyard, ensuring the safety of the martial law troops and the guesthouse.

Meanwhile, the staff of the guesthouse, disregarding their personal safety, carefully took care of and arranged the life and study of the soldiers and officers. On June 3 alone, the guesthouse organized staff to continuously boil 15 pots of water without stopping and delivered the water to the tired and thirsty soldiers cup by cup. In the following days, the head of the service team of the guesthouse, along with the on-duty staff, cleared three meeting rooms and corridors, found bedding, and arranged for the soldiers to stay. They sent meals and water on time, only resting after the soldiers went to sleep and waking up before the soldiers did. The head of the kitchen team risked going out to buy vegetables for the soldiers, and the entire team worked tirelessly to increase the variety of meals. Due to severe obstacles on the way, the soldiers' personal items were almost all stolen or lost, and some even lost their shoes and socks. The Communist Party members Meng Qingchao and Yu Guirong, disregarding their personal safety, went from street to street, buying toothbrushes, toothpaste, mouthwash basins, towels, soap, and nearly a thousand other daily necessities for the soldiers from stalls and small shops. Some comrades also gave their own washing powder, soap, tea leaves, boiled eggs, and medicine to the soldiers. The guesthouse also opened the bathrooms to the soldiers, provided washing powder, clothes, socks, and moved in 9 color TVs for the soldiers to watch.

During the 8 days the soldiers and officers stayed, the Bureau of General Affairs of the Central Organization Department, according to the leaders' instructions, sent bureau and section-level cadres to the guesthouse for duty and specific guidance. At the most critical moment, the bureau leaders still insisted on commanding on the spot. The branch secretary, director, and committee members of the guesthouse worked day and night. All 10 Communist Party members of the branch, except for one who was on sick leave, all insisted on working day and night, fighting on the front line, appearing wherever there were difficulties. Many workers handed over their children to the elderly or relatives for care and insisted on going to work every day.

The actions of the Cui Ming Zhuang Guesthouse in rescuing, protecting, and taking care of the People's Liberation Army deeply moved the soldiers and officers of the martial law troops. Many officers and soldiers said: "We have been obstructed, beaten, and cursed everywhere in the past few days. Some have sacrificed their lives, some have been injured, and some have lost contact. The comrades of the Central Organization Department have been so good to us, and we are very grateful."

The soldiers actively helped the guesthouse with cleaning, kitchen work, washing vegetables, cutting vegetables, and serving meals. On the day they left the guesthouse, many soldiers were reluctant to part and shed tears of gratitude.

    危难时刻……
    ——中组部翠明庄招待所救援戒严部队指战员纪实
    朱昭
    在北京发生反革命暴乱期间，中共中央组织部翠明庄招待所全体党员、干部、职工在戒严部队受到围追堵截的严重时刻挺身而出，救援、保护、照顾了220名解放军某部指战员。
    6月3日凌晨，戒严部队某部220名指战员在向天安门广场开进途中，受到一伙歹徒和不明真相的群众围追堵截，退到中组部翠明庄招待所院墙外，其中有些战士受伤。这时，招待所大门外至北侧十字路口被人群堵得水泄不通，一片骚乱声、叫骂声。指战员们被紧紧地围在墙根下，进不得，退不得，情势十分危急。招待所值夜班的女共产党员孟庆朝在得到中组部领导的指示后，冒着危险，机智勇敢，几次只身出门寻找部队领导，并与学生和群众反复交涉、解释，同时组织防护队，很快将被围攻的戒严部队指战员全部安全转移到招待所院内休息。
    指战员进入院内后，招待所仍被包围，墙外喧嚣声、砸门声不绝于耳，大院随时都有被冲的危险。招待所党支部又相继收留了3名被冲散、打伤的战士；掩护部队与上级联络；并与派出所的同志紧密配合，清出混入院内的闲杂人员，采取措施加强大院内外的防范工作，保证了戒严部队指战员和招待所的安全。
    与此同时，招待所的同志不顾个人安危，精心照顾和安排指战员的生活和学习。仅3日一天，招待所就组织人员一刻未停地连续烧了15炉开水，并将开水一壶一壶、一碗一碗送到又累又渴的战士手中。在其后的几天，招待所服务班长带着值班人员腾出三间会议室和楼道，找来铺盖，安排战士住宿；按时送饭、送水，坚持在战士们睡觉后才睡觉，战士们起床前先起床。招待所炊事班长冒险上街为战士们买菜，全班同志不辞劳累，想方设法使饭菜花样尽量增多。由于途中严重受阻，战士随身带的生活用品几乎被抢光、丢尽，有的连脚上的鞋袜都没有了。招待所的共产党员孟庆朝、于桂荣等不顾个人安危，走街串巷，在摊贩和小店为战士们代买了牙刷、牙膏、漱口缸、毛巾、香皂等近千件生活必需品。有的同志还把自己的洗衣粉、香皂、茶叶、煮鸡蛋、药品等送给了战士。招待所还向战士开放浴室，送来洗衣粉、衣物、鞋袜，搬来9台彩电，供战士收看。
    在指战员住所的8天中，中组部机关事务管理局按照部领导的要求，每天派局、处级干部轮流到招待所值班、具体指导工作。在最紧张的时刻，局领导仍坚持在现场指挥。招待所支部书记、所长和支委更是夜以继日地工作。全支部10名共产党员，除一人病休以外，人人都坚持日夜上班，战斗在第一线，哪里有困难，就在哪里出现。许多职工把自己的孩子交给老人或亲友照顾，坚持天天上班。
    翠明庄招待所救援、保护、照顾解放军的行动，深深感动了戒严部队指战员。许多干部战士说：“我们连日来到处受阻、挨打、挨骂，有的牺牲了，有的被打伤，有的失去了联系。中央组织部的同志对我们这么好，我们非常感激。”
    战士们主动帮助招待所打扫卫生、帮厨、洗菜、切菜、端饭。离开招待所的那天，许多战士依依不舍，流下了热泪。刊头设计　刘小青
