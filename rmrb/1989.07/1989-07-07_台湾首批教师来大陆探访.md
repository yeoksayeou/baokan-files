The first group of teachers from Taiwan public schools, consisting of 27 people, visited the Lugou Bridge in Beijing this morning to pay their respects to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the "July 7th Incident" during the resistance against Japanese aggression.

This visit group, organized by the Taiwan Teachers' Human Rights Promotion Association, arrived in Beijing yesterday. It is the first group of Taiwanese teachers to visit the mainland since the Taiwan authorities allowed public school teachers to visit the mainland for family reunions.
