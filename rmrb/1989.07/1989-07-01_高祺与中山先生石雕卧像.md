Visitors to the Mausoleum of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in Nanjing are always deeply impressed by the reclining statue on his stone sarcophagus. Those who pay close attention can see the inscription "Gao Qi, June 1, 1929" on the stone base beneath the statue's feet.

Perhaps because Dr. Sun Yat-sen had close ties with various circles in Japan during his lifetime, some people assume that the sculptor of this statue must be Japanese. This is incorrect. Gao Qi is a Czech.

This year marks the 100th anniversary of Gao Qi's birth. Gao Qi's full name in Czech is Bohuslav Gao Qi. He was born in Mlada Boleslav, a city in central Bohemia, Czechoslovakia. Gao Qi came from a humble background and, as a teenager, studied stone masonry at a two-year vocational school. After graduating, he worked in various historical cities such as Dresden and Berlin, and even opened a stone carving workshop in Vienna, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the time.

After the outbreak of World War I, Gao Qi was conscripted into the army. In 1916, he was captured by Russian forces on the Eastern Front and subsequently made a living as a stone mason in Russia. In October 1918, Gao Qi joined the Czechoslovak Legion in Soviet Russia. On October 28 of the same year, the independent Czechoslovak Republic, with Czechs and Slovaks as its main ethnic groups, was proclaimed. Gao Qi was appointed as a staff member of the Czechoslovak government's office in Vladivostok.

However, as a sculptor, Gao Qi yearned for the opportunity to travel the world and study sculpture. He repeatedly requested to be released from his government position. In April 1920, the Czechoslovak government approved his request, and in May, he came to China. He first collected and studied ancient and modern Chinese stone carvings in cities such as Beijing and Tianjin. Later, he was invited to Shanghai to work on sculptures and architectural decorations, and eventually settled there. Because he skillfully blended European and Asian sculptural techniques, his works were both imbued with the elegance and sophistication of Western classical sculpture and possessed the exuberance and depth of Eastern art, earning him widespread admiration and acclaim.

After the passing of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Mausoleum Construction Committee held an open bidding for his statue. Gao Qi, with great respect for this Eastern great man, carefully conceived his design, ultimately winning the bid over nearly 30 competitors from both China and abroad. He then meticulously carved the reclining statue on a block of Han white marble for 15 months. The statue was completed on schedule. Gao Qi, as the creator of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's reclining statue, was invited to participate in the ceremony for the interment of Dr. Sun Yat-sen at the Mausoleum on June 1, 1929.

Before the outbreak of the "August 13 Incident" by Japanese invaders, Gao Qi accepted an invitation from a Chinese overseas to board a ship from Saigon to Singapore. In February 1942, Gao Qi left Singapore. Unfortunately, the ship he was on was intercepted by Japanese warships shortly after leaving the port, and Gao Qi perished when his lifeboat capsized.

Although Bohuslav Gao Qi, as a citizen of the Czechoslovak Republic, was unable to return to his homeland to serve his people directly, his sculptures of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and countless other works demonstrate that he had brilliantly fulfilled the promise he made to his government before coming to China—to promote the young Czechoslovak Republic. His brilliant works have become an enduring chapter in the cultural exchange and friendship between China and Czechoslovakia.

    高祺与中山先生石雕卧像
    朱伟华　希玛〔捷克斯洛伐克〕
    参观过南京中山陵的人，都会对中山先生石棺上的卧像留下深刻印象。细心的瞻仰者还可以在中山先生卧像脚下方的石基上看到“高祺，1929年6月1日”的字样。
    也许是因为中山先生生前与日本各界朋友交往甚密之故吧，于是有人便以为这座石像的作者是日本人了。这是不符合事实的。高祺是捷克人。
    今年6月21日，是高祺诞生100周年纪念日。高祺的捷克语全名是博胡斯拉夫·高祺，他出生在捷克斯洛伐克波希米亚中部的姆拉达·波莱斯拉夫城。高祺出身贫寒，青少年时期曾在两年制的艺徒学校学习石匠手艺。毕业后在本地区及德累斯顿、柏林等一些历史名城从事石雕工作，并曾在当时奥匈帝国的京都维也纳开设过石雕工作室。
    第一次世界大战爆发后，高祺应征入伍。1916年，高祺在东线被俄军俘虏，此后在俄国以石匠手艺谋生。1918年10月3日高祺参加了在苏俄的捷克斯洛伐克军团。同年10月28日，以捷克人和斯洛伐克人为主体民族的独立的捷克斯洛伐克共和国宣告成立，高祺被任命为捷政府驻海参崴办事机构的工作人员。
    然而，作为石雕家的高祺渴望有机会到世界各国观摩雕塑艺术，因此他多次请求捷政府免去其公职。1920年4月，捷政府批准了他的请求，5月他便来到中国。他先在北平、天津等北方城市大量收集和研究中国古代及近代石雕艺术品，后应聘赴上海从事雕塑和建筑物的装饰工作，并在上海定居。由于他善于极自然地将欧洲和亚洲造型艺术的手法融为一体，使他的作品既充满西方古典雕塑的华贵与典雅的韵味，又颇具东方艺术奔放与浑厚的气息，因而备受人们的赏识和推崇。
    孙中山先生逝世后，中山陵修建委员会公开招标为中山先生塑像。高祺怀着对这位东方伟人的崇敬心情精心构思，终于使他的方案胜过近30名中外投标者而中了头标。随后，他便日复一日地在一块汉白玉石上精雕细琢。15个月后，中山先生的卧像终于按期完成。高祺作为中山先生卧像塑造者，应邀参加了1929年6月1日的中山先生奉安中山陵仪式。
    在日本侵略者发动“八·一三”事变前夕，高祺应一位华侨之邀，乘船经西贡前往新加坡。1942年2月，高祺离开新加坡。不幸的是他所乘的轮船在出港不久后遭到日本军舰的截击，高祺因所乘救生艇倾覆而罹难。
    博胡斯拉夫·高祺作为捷克斯洛伐克共和国的公民，虽然未能回到自己的祖国直接为本国人民服务，但他所雕塑的孙中山先生卧像以及无数其他作品，说明他已经出色地履行了他在来华前对其本国政府许下的诺言——宣传年轻的捷克斯洛伐克共和国。他的光辉作品已成为中捷两国人民文化交流的不朽篇章和友谊的见证。
