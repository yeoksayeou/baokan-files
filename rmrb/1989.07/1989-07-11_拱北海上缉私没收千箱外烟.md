A customs patrol boat from Gangbei Customs intercepted a Hong Kong fishing boat attempting to engage in smuggling activities in the waters near Lingding Island, Zhuhai City, early on the morning of July 7. Customs officials found 995 boxes of foreign cigarettes, including brands such as "Kent," "Lafayette," and "Hilton," valued at approximately 2.23 million yuan. Five suspected smugglers on board, including two mainland Chinese and three Hong Kong residents, were also apprehended by the customs officials.

A Gangbei Customs official told reporters that since the beginning of this year, maritime smuggling activities have been rampant. Smugglers have been illegally transporting large quantities of foreign cigarettes and household appliances into the country, seriously disrupting the national economic order. In response, Gangbei Customs has strengthened its anti-smuggling efforts and focused on cracking down on these activities. From January to June this year, a total of 139 maritime smuggling cases were uncovered, with a combined value of over 36 million yuan.

    拱北海上缉私没收千箱外烟
    新华社珠海七月十一日电  （记者张愈升）拱北海关的一艘海上缉私艇，七日凌晨在珠海市外伶仃岛附近海面截获一艘企图进行走私活动的香港渔船。海关缉私人员在船上搜出“健牌”、“良友”、“希尔顿”等外国香烟九百九十五箱，价值人民币约二百二十三万多元。船上的五名走私嫌疑分子也被我海关人员当场抓获，其中两名是内地人，三名是香港人。
    拱北海关负责人向记者介绍说，今年以来，海上走私活动较为猖獗，走私分子将大量外国烟和家用电器等走私物品，通过海上非法偷运入境，严重干扰国家经济秩序。对此，拱北海关加强缉私工作，集中力量予以打击。今年一至六月，共查获海上走私案件一百三十九宗，价值人民币三千六百多万元。
