In the western part of Brazil lies Formoso Lake, which contains Formoso Island. The island covers an area of 1.5 square kilometers. Over 100 years ago, this island was connected to the mainland. Later, due to a landslide, it separated from the shore and became a floating island covered with a thick layer of tree branches, leaves, and debris. It is the world's unique "floating island" and one of Brazil's famous tourist attractions.

When visitors board the floating island, if the wind direction is favorable and the wind is strong enough, it feels like sitting in a giant ferry, floating at varying speeds in Formoso Lake, offering a unique experience.

When the lake is calm, the floating island stops in the middle of the lake, and tourists have to take small boats to the island. Although they cannot experience the island floating in the lake, visiting the floating island is still worthwhile.

Since floating islands are unique to Brazil, they attract tourists from all over the world.

In recent years, military expenditures of various countries have been increasing at a significant rate annually, reaching nearly $1000 billion.

What does $1000 billion in military expenditures mean? It is roughly equivalent to the annual income of the 44 poorest countries in the world. If divided equally among the global population of 5.1 billion, each person would bear nearly $200. On average, military expenditures amount to over $1.6 million per minute.

The countries with the highest military expenditures are the two military superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, which together account for more than half of the world's military expenditures. In 1987, the United States' military expenditure was approximately $290 billion, accounting for about 31% of the world total. According to estimates by Western experts, the Soviet Union's military expenditure was around $260 billion, accounting for about 28% of the world's total military expenditure.

Other countries with significant military expenditures include Japan, France, the United Kingdom, and West Germany.

China's defense budget accounts for a very small proportion of the national fiscal budget and has not increased significantly over the past decade. It is roughly equivalent to 1/60th of the United States' and 1/50th of the Soviet Union's expenditures, not even amounting to a fraction of theirs.

    神奇的“浮岛”
    张永胜
    在巴西西部的福莫索湖里有个福莫索岛，它面积1.5平方公里。100多年前，这座岛与陆地连在一起。后来由于泥崩，与湖岸脱离，才变成了覆盖着一厚层树枝叶片和碎石的浮动小岛，它就是世界独一无二的“浮岛”，巴西著名的旅游胜地之一。
    游人登上浮岛，要是风向适合，风力足够，大家好像坐在一只庞大的渡船中，在福莫索湖中时快时慢地浮动，别有一番情趣。
    每当风平浪静，浮岛停在湖中央时，游客们就只好乘坐小船登岛了。虽然领略不到岛在湖中浮动的奇趣，但能到浮岛一游，便也不虚此行。
    由于浮岛只有巴西才有，所以它吸引着世界各地的旅游者。军费开支知多少？余洋
    近年来，世界各国的军费开支年年都以较大的幅度增长，目前已接近10000亿美元。
    10000亿美元的军费开支意味着什么？它大体相当于全球44个最穷国家的全年收入；按全球51亿人口平分，每人约摊近200美元；以时间平均，每分钟要开支军费160多万美元。
    世界上军费开支最多的国家是美苏两个军事大国，约占了全球军费开支的一半以上。1987年，美国的军费开支约为2900亿美元，约占世界的31％。苏联的军费开支据西方有关专家估算约2600亿美元，约占世界军费总开支的28％。
    其它军费开支较多的国家还有日本、法国、英国、联邦德国等。
    我国的国防费开支在国家财政预算中所占比例甚小，近10年来增长也不大，大体上只相当于美国的1／60，苏联的1／50，还不够它们的一个零头。
