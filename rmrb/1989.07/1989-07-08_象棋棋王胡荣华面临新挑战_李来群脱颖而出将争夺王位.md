Today, the first stage of the second Chinese Chess King Tournament concluded. Li Laiqun from Hebei secured the right to challenge, and will soon face the reigning king Hu Ronghua to contend for the throne. In the fifth round, Li Laiqun encountered Jiangsu's Xu Tianhong, who had maintained an undefeated record. Li Laiqun displayed brilliant moves, sacrificing his chariot twice, and concealed a powerful strategy with his horse and cannon. Xu Tianhong was left with only defensive moves. Ultimately, Li Laiqun won with an advantage of multiple paired soldiers. In the sixth round, despite losing to the "Northeast Tiger" Wang Jialiang, it did not affect the outcome. Li Laiqun secured the challenge right with 9 points.

At 27 years old, Li Laiqun has rapidly risen since the early 1980s, becoming the fifth national champion in the history of Chinese chess in New China, following Yang Gonglin, Li Yiting, Hu Ronghua, and Liu Dahua. Veteran Wang Jialiang commented that Li Laiqun's style is gentle yet firm, with deep endgame skills, and has the potential to become the second chess king.

The players who secured the second to seventh places are: Jiangsu's Xu Tianhong, Hong Kong's Zhao Riquan, Heilongjiang's Wang Jialiang, Taipei's Wu Guilin, Heilongjiang's Zhao Guorong, and Singapore's Zheng Xiangfu.

The time and location for Li Laiqun's challenge against the reigning king Hu Ronghua are yet to be determined.

    象棋棋王胡荣华面临新挑战  李来群脱颖而出将争夺王位
    本报哈尔滨7月8日电　今晚，第二届象棋棋王赛（第一阶段）偃旗息鼓。河北李来群获得挑战权，不日将向上届棋王胡荣华挑战，争夺王位。李来群在第五轮比赛中与保持不败的江苏徐天红相遇。只见他妙招连珠，两次弃车，暗伏马后炮杀招，逼得徐天红只有招架之功。最后李来群以多双兵获胜。在第六轮比赛中，尽管他负于“东北虎”王嘉良，但已无关大局。他以积9分的成绩稳操挑战权。
    27岁的李来群从80年代初期连跨三大步，成为新中国象棋史上继杨宫璘、李义庭、胡荣华和柳大华之后第五位全国冠军。老将王嘉良说他棋风柔中见刚，残局功夫深厚，有望成为第二位棋王。
    获得二至七名的棋手是：江苏徐天红、香港赵汝权、黑龙江王嘉良、台北吴贵临、黑龙江赵国荣和新加坡郑祥福。
