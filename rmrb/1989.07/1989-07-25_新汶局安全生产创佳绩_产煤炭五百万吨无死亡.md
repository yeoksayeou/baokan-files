Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 25th.

The National Safety Production Committee recently issued a notice to various provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, as well as relevant departments under the State Council, commending the Shandong New Wencheng Mining Bureau for its achievement of producing 500 million tons of coal without any fatalities.

The Shandong New Wencheng Mining Bureau produced 1048 million tons of coal last year, doubling its original design capacity. The fatality rate per 100 million tons was reduced to 0.76, placing it among the top large coal mines in the country. This year, the bureau has continued to relentlessly prioritize safety work. They have overhauled the safety responsibility system, formulated safety contract measures, and implemented annual safety control indicators at all levels, from mines to departments and teams. They have also linked each individual's economic interests to the overall safety performance of the bureau. Additionally, they have established a monthly safety analysis and reporting system and a targeted management system for mines with passive safety records, signing safety contracts with each mine to gradually standardize, formalize, and scientize safety management. Furthermore, the bureau has overhauled the safety inspection teams, strengthened quality inspection and acceptance work, and reinforced team building and on-site management. Since November 15th of last year until May when relevant departments of the State Council sent personnel to investigate, the bureau has achieved 168 consecutive days of safe production.

    新汶局安全生产创佳绩
    产煤炭五百万吨无死亡
    新华社北京7月25日电　（记者赵明亮）全国安全生产委员会新近向各省、市、自治区及国务院有关部委发出通报，表彰山东新汶矿务局连续产煤500万吨无死亡事故的事迹。
    山东新汶矿务局去年产煤1048万吨，比原设计能力翻了一番，百万吨死亡率降到0.76，名列全国大型煤矿的前茅。今年这个局继续坚持不懈地把安全工作作为头等大事来抓。他们整顿安全责任制，制订安全承包办法，把全年安全控制指标逐级落实到各矿处、区队，并把每个人的经济利益与全局安全状况的好坏挂起钩来；建立安全工作月度分析汇报制度和对安全工作被动矿的重点管理制度，与各矿签定安全合同，使安全管理工作逐步走上制度化、正规化、科学化的轨道。另外，这个局还整顿了安全检查队伍，加强了质量检查验收工作，强化了班组建设和现场管理。自去年11月15日到今年5月国务院有关部门派人调查为止，已连续安全生产168天。
