Title: The Pumping Station's Walls Are Cracked and the House Is Split, No One Is Managing It

The pumping station under our jurisdiction was built in the 1970s. In recent years, due to damage to the underground water inlet pipes connected to the pumping station's water storage pool, the ground has sunk, causing the walls of the pumping station to crack and the courtyard walls to tilt. Employees have to squeeze through the gaps between two large iron doors to enter and exit. Despite working in this dangerous environment, the employees of the pumping station continue to operate the pumps every day without stopping the discharge of sewage. Although the leadership of our station has repeatedly reported the situation of the pumping station to the relevant authorities and leaders, no one has taken any action. Do we have to wait until a personal accident occurs before taking any measures to address this issue?

    排水泵房墙歪屋裂无人管
    我站所管辖的一排水泵房是七十年代修建的。近年来，由于连接泵房蓄水池的地下进水管道损坏，造成地面下沉，致使泵房墙身断裂，院墙歪斜，职工上下班只好从两扇大铁门的夹缝中钻进钻出，就在这种危险环境中，排水泵房的职工每天仍坚持值班开泵，从未停止污水的排放工作。我站领导虽多次向主管部门和有关领导反映泵房情况，但不见有人过问。难道非要等到发生人身事故以后，才着手解决？！
