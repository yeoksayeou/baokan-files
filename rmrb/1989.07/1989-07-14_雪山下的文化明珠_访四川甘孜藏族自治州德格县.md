Dege, a hidden gem of Tibetan culture, lies on the banks of the Jinsha River at the western edge of Sichuan's Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, where Sichuan and Tibet meet. We traveled from the Chengdu Plain to Dege in a jeep, speeding along the Sichuan-Tibet Highway for four or five days, crossing the 3,400-meter-high Erlang Mountain, the 4,200-meter-high Zheduo Mountain, and the 6,000-meter-high Que'er Mountain. This journey perhaps explains why Dege's cultural value is so disproportionate to its fame.

The Dege Printing House is a sacred site of Tibetan Buddhism. Like the major monasteries in the Kham region, the walls of the printing house are high and thick, giving it the appearance of a sturdy fortress. At the top of the platform, the golden wheel and golden peacock bestowed by the Yongzheng Emperor shine brightly under the snow-capped mountains and blue sky, creating an atmosphere of solemnity, eternity, and mystery.

The Dege Printing House was built by the 12th Dege chieftain, Cegyi Denba Zhenren, in the seventh year of the Yongzheng reign, or 1729 AD. Over generations, the chieftains expanded the buildings and added more printed scriptures, gradually making it one of the largest printing houses in the Tibetan region with the most scripture blocks. The scripture blocks left by previous generations, along with those carved after the establishment of the Cultural Relics Bureau in 1979, total 268,000 blocks. Among them, the "Kangyur," or the Tibetan Buddhist Canon, is a must-have scripture for Tibetan Buddhist monasteries; the "History of Indian Buddhism" is a rare and unique work. Apart from Buddhist scriptures, there are numerous early Tibetan medical texts, as well as historical biographies, astronomy and calendar studies, dictionaries and grammar, poetry and phonetics, and arts and crafts. These have extremely important scientific value for the study of Tibetan culture.

Comrade Zhou Yongkang of the county committee told us that as the Party's religious policy in ethnic minority areas is gradually implemented, Tibetan monasteries are being restored, and there is a great demand for scriptures, all coming here to print books. Many research institutions at home and abroad also treasure the original editions of books here. The printing business of the printing house is more active than any other period in history.

Dege has 54 monasteries, preserving a large number of thangkas (scroll paintings) and murals. The Moreg Monastery, which is rich in the characteristics of the Sakya sect, has a history of over 700 years. Inside the Jebu Scripture Hall, the walls are covered with murals, with unique and vivid shapes and harmonious, colorful hues, making every inch of the wall full of endless interest. The 77-year-old head lama said that he has been practicing here since childhood, and he cannot even recall the creation dates of these murals. The head lama of the Gongba Monastery also showed us several precious large thangkas, including "Padmasambhava" and "Vajrakila," which are 5.6 meters long and 3 meters wide, with a magnificent and awe-inspiring presence. The full composition, lively rhythm, and luxurious and solemn decorative patterns make anyone standing in front of the paintings unable to help but be amazed by the artistic creativity of the Tibetan people. In the early 1980s, a group of young Tibetan painters from Ganzi came to Dege for inspiration. It was in front of these paintings that they understood the direction of their creation and completely changed their style, quickly creating a sensation in the art world with new Tibetan paintings such as "King Gesar." Since then, the "Ganzi Tibetan Painting School" has stood out in the art world.

Dege is also one of the birthplaces of Tibetan medicine. The Dege Tibetan Hospital has more than 20 Tibetan doctors, treating over 40,000 patients from Sichuan, Tibet, Yunnan, and Qinghai each year. With the support of the state, the hospital has established a relatively large Tibetan medicine factory in recent years, with more than 180 commonly used patent medicines. In addition to treating patients, the doctors also know how to collect and manufacture medicines themselves, with the most notable effects being the treatment of hepatitis B and various stomach diseases, with a reputation that has spread overseas.

The hospital has more than 200 traditional medical books, and the doctors also engage in the collation and research of ancient texts. The 700-year-old pharmaceutical work "Jingzhu Ben Cao" and the 600-year-old diagnostic and prescription work "Qianwan Shili" have been published in recent years.

### 雪山下的文化明珠——访四川甘孜藏族自治州德格县

    雪山下的文化明珠
    ——访四川甘孜藏族自治州德格县
    德格，有如一颗尚未广为人知的藏族文化的宝珠，孤悬在四川甘孜藏族自治州的西端、川藏交界处的金沙江畔。我们从成都平原乘越野车访德格，沿川藏公路疾驰四、五天，途中翻越了海拔3400米的二郎山、4200米的折多山、6000米的雀儿山。这也许可以说明德格的文化价值同它的知名度为何如此不成比例。
    德格印经院，是藏传佛教的圣地。同康巴地区各大寺院一样，印经院墙高体厚，外观尤如一座坚固的堡垒。顶部平台上，由雍正皇帝册封御赐的金轮和金孔雀在雪山蓝天下熠熠生辉，形成一种庄严、永恒、神秘的氛围。
    德格印经院是由第12世德格土司却吉·登巴译仁于清雍正7年，即公元1729年修建的，经历代土司扩建房屋、增刻经书，逐渐成为藏族地区规模最大、书版最多的印经院之一。历代留下的经版，加上1979年建立文管所以后补刻的，共有26.8万块。其中《甘珠尔》、即大藏经，是喇嘛教寺院必备的典籍；《印度佛教源流》，更是稀世孤本。除掉佛教典籍，还有大量藏族早期医药学著作以及历史传记、天文历算、辞书文法、诗词音韵、工艺美术等书版，对于研究藏族文化，具有极其重要的科学价值。
    县委周永康同志告诉我们，党在少数民族地区的宗教政策逐步落实后，藏族地区寺院纷纷恢复，需要大量经书，都来到这里印书。国内外许多研究机构也将这里的原版图书视若珍宝。印经院的印书业务比历史上哪个时期都活跃。
    德格有54座寺院，保存着大量唐卡（卷轴藏画）和壁画。富于萨迦派特色的更庆寺有700多年历史，其哲布经堂内，四壁满是壁画，奇特生动的造型，绚丽协调的色彩，使每一寸墙壁都蕴藏着无限兴味。主持喇嘛已77岁高龄，他说，他自幼在此修行，这些壁画的创作年代，连他也说不清，更勤寺主持又请我们观赏了几幅珍藏的大型唐卡，其中《莲花生》和《金刚橛》两幅，长5.6米，宽3米，气魄恢宏，夺人心魄。饱满的构图、生动的气韵、华丽庄严的装饰图纹，使任何人站在画前都不能不为藏族人民的艺术创造力所折服。80年代初，甘孜州一批藏族青年画家到德格采风，就是在这些画前，领悟到自己创作道路何在，彻底转变画风，很快就以《格萨尔王》等一批新藏画轰动美术界，从此“甘孜藏画派”在艺坛上独树一帜。
    德格又是藏族医药学的发祥地之一。德格县藏医院，有20多名藏医，每年收治来自川、藏、滇、青广大区域的患者4万人次。在国家支持下，医院近年办起一个颇具规模的藏药厂，仅常用成药就有180多种。医生们除看病，又都会自采自制药品，其中又以治疗乙型肝炎和各种胃病的疗效最为显著，名声已远播海外。
    藏医院存有传统医书200多部，医生们又兼作古籍的整理、研究工作。有700年历史的配药学著作《晶珠本草》和600年历史的诊断、配方学著作《千万佘利》两书近年已出版。
