To cultivate outstanding athletes who are well-rounded in moral, intellectual, physical, and aesthetic development, the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports has decided to integrate sports schools into the general education system. This move aims to ensure that young athletes can balance their studies and training, creating a new model where the education and sports systems jointly cultivate athletic talent. On July 18th, the Shichahai Sports School in Beijing established a junior high school division, named the First 100th Middle School.

Students who graduate from primary school and pass the regular entrance exam to enter this school will receive formal junior high education. This will address the previous issue of athletes having interrupted schooling, leading to poor academic performance and dissatisfaction from parents. Students in the second year of junior high must pass the vocational school entrance exam and be approved by the Municipal Secondary School Admissions Office to become official vocational students at the sports school. This ensures that athletes' academic performance is guaranteed.

The Education Bureau has assigned excellent teachers to the school and provided better teaching facilities. After comprehensive training, outstanding students will advance to the sports school and be assigned to various sports teams in Beijing. Others will be trained to become other types of sports professionals needed by society.

    读训并重  全面发展
    北京将体育学校纳入普教结构
    本报讯  为培养德、智、体、美全面发展的优秀体育人才，北京市体委已决定将体育运动学校纳入普教结构，使青少年读、训并重，形成教育和体育系统共同培养体育人才的新格局。七月十八日北京市什刹海体育运动学校已成立初中部，并定名为第一○○中学。
    凡小学毕业后，经过正规的入学考试进入这个学校的适龄体育苗子，将受到正规的初中教育，克服了过去体育苗子上学时断时续，以至学习成绩差，家长不满意的现象。在校初中二年级学生须经中专入学考试，成绩合格并经市中等学校招生办公室审批后，才能成为体育学校正式中专学生，这样能使体育苗子的文化成绩得到保证。
    教育局已给学校分配了优秀教师，增添了较好的教学设施。学生经过全面培养，其中优秀者将升入体育运动学校，输送到北京市各体育运动队，另一部分将培养成社会所需的其它体育人才。
