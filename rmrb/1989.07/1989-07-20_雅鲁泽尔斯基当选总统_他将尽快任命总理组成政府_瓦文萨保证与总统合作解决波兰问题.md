The joint session of the Polish parliament and senate, known as the National Assembly, was held yesterday afternoon in Warsaw. The session elected the President of the Polish People's Republic. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, was elected as the President of the Polish People's Republic.

A total of 544 deputies and senators participated in the voting, with 537 valid votes. The counting result showed that Jaruzelski was elected with a majority of 270 votes. There were 34 abstentions and 233 votes against. After the election results were announced, the deputies and senators applauded warmly.

Jaruzelski is 66 years old, a military man by profession. He served as the Chief of the General Staff in 1965, and as the Minister of Defense from 1968 to 1983. He was elected as a member of the Central Committee in 1964, and has been a member of the Politburo since 1971. He was elected as the First Secretary of the Central Committee in October 1981. In December 1981, Poland declared martial law, and Jaruzelski served as the Chairman of the Military Council of National Salvation until martial law was lifted in July 1983. He served as the Prime Minister from February 1981 to November 1985. In November 1985, he was elected as the Chairman of the Council of State.

Polish People's Republic's newly elected President Jaruzelski said on the evening of the 19th, "Without profound reforms, there will be no strong and stable country, but without a stable country that functions normally, it is impossible to carry out effective reforms." He called on the Polish people to "maintain the dignity and reputation of the country."

After taking the oath of office at the National Assembly on the evening of the 19th, Jaruzelski said in his speech that he would do his best to be a president who advocates national reconciliation and represents the interests of all the Polish people. He said he would listen to the opinions of all parties, including those who oppose him and do not like him.

When talking about the current situation and tasks in Poland, he pointed out that the domestic situation in Poland is still difficult and complex, and the country "faces a series of problems." He believes that the most urgent task at present is to "concentrate all efforts on economic work." He reminded experts that while emphasizing economic efficiency, "do not neglect the principle of social justice."

He announced that he would appoint a prime minister as soon as possible to form a new government and start working.
