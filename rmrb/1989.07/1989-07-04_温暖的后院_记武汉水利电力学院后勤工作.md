Among the more than 30 colleges and universities in the Wuhan region, Wuhan Institute of Hydraulic and Electric Power has long been relatively unnoticed. However, in the past two years, the silence of the campus has been broken: the Hubei Provincial Education Commission has promoted their experiences across the province's higher education institutions, and the State Education Commission has sent personnel to investigate and summarize their work.

What exactly has happened here?

Students at Wuhan University often say, "Eat at the Water Institute," and they frequently gather here on weekends for a feast.

In China, there is a saying, "Eat in Guangzhou." However, among the 100,000 university students in Wuhan's colleges and universities, in recent years, another saying has spread: "Eat at the Water Institute."

During the spring when flowers bloom, reporters came to this institute by reputation. We toured the dining halls, kitchens, bakeries, cold drink departments, small shops, tofu workshops, and pig farms of the four student canteens. We discovered that each canteen offers more than 10 types of staple foods for three meals a day. Just for noodles, there are more than 10 varieties, including soup noodles, stir-fried noodles, braised noodles, beef noodles, cold noodles from Yanbian, Wuhan's hot dry noodles, Lanzhou pulled noodles, and Shanxi knife-cut noodles. During lunch and dinner, the counters are filled with high, medium, and low-grade meat and vegetable dishes, with a variety of southern and northern flavors, totaling more than 50 types.

Several students who were eating told the reporter proudly, "Each of us spends only about 30 yuan per month to enjoy approximately 50 yuan worth of meals, which is about 20% cheaper than other universities in Wuhan." The cooks work hard every day, raising pigs, grinding tofu, and pickling salted vegetables. They use 80% of the pure income from these sideline productions to subsidize student meals. In 1988 alone, more than 6,000 dining students each received an average subsidy of 6.8 yuan per month from the canteen. Therefore, in recent years, despite the significant increase in prices, the canteen at the Water Institute has managed to slightly raise the price of meat dishes while keeping the price of vegetable dishes at around 1 yuan per serving. No wonder, during weekends and holidays, many students from various universities in Wuhan flock here to dine and enjoy a feast.

Professor Jie missed the train due to a mistake in the schedule. The driver rushed 27 kilometers to let him catch the next train at the next station.

Professor Jie Guangrun from the Electric Power Department went to Beijing for a meeting but mistakenly noted the wrong train time. The driver, Xu Zuyuan, took him to Wuchang Station just as the train had departed. Xu then took a shortcut and drove 27 kilometers, allowing Professor Jie to catch the same train at the next station, Hankou. The car fleet operates a 24-hour dispatch and driver system. Over the years, the car fleet has never missed a train or ship when picking up and dropping off people at stations and docks.

One morning, an elderly professor near 70 years old was cooking breakfast and found that the gas cylinder was empty. Just as he was worried, the sound of the gas delivery person's bell rang in the courtyard. The old professor hurried to the window and shouted downstairs, "Comrade, please deliver a cylinder to room 502!" Three minutes later, the gas station worker carried a full cylinder up to the fifth floor and delivered it to the old professor's kitchen. For years, the school's gas station has insisted on delivering gas cylinders to the staff dormitories three times a day, regardless of weather, and even for high-rise buildings, they only charge 2 jiao for labor. Moreover, the cost of each cylinder has risen from 8 yuan to 14 yuan, but they still charge the staff only 3.3 yuan per cylinder. Just for this, the logistics department pays the staff an annual gas subsidy of over 80,000 yuan.

Once, a student representative raised a suggestion to the school leadership, saying that the quilts in the student dormitories were too short for tall students. A few days later, special long quilts made at a military factory were delivered to the beds of the tall students. The speed was surprisingly fast, and the students were so moved that they kept saying "thank you."

During the dialogue between the school leadership and 300 teachers and students in 1987, the comments on the logistics work were mostly praises, with only 3 minor suggestions. However, during the 1984 school-wide faculty representatives' meeting, 400 proposals and suggestions were made, and 2/3 of them were about logistics work.

The logistics department has transformed from a block of ice into a burning flame, melting the barriers between students and the department.

Four years ago, the administrative funds allocated to the logistics department by the Water Institute were between 180 to 200 million yuan annually, accounting for more than 1/3 of the school's allocable operational funds. The logistics department often had conflicts with the teaching and research departments over funds. Students frequently had disputes with the cooks over the quality and price of meals, even to the point of group fights. The "young master" drivers played cards and chatted during work hours, and even the secretary and the president couldn't guarantee a car. The teaching and living facilities were in arrears... In 1985, the Water Institute began to trial "separation of government and enterprise," moving towards enterprise management, and the economic benefits have increased year by year. In 1988, the annual administrative funds taken by the logistics department from the school were reduced by about 100 million yuan compared to before the reform. The 560-plus employees of the contracted units no longer received wages and welfare from the school, and the school's net income and savings increased by over 300 million yuan. The growing economic benefits are like a source of living water, continuously enhancing the school's economic strength.

Due to the persistent adherence to the principle of serving teaching, research, and the lives of teachers and students during the logistics reform, and the strong ideological and political work, the spirit of "pursuing ideals, comparing services, loving the collective, and competing for contributions" has been formed in the logistics department. Therefore, in recent years, when the logistics department used most of the income from creating and saving funds for school construction and adding service items, and the personal income of employees grew very little, there were no complaints or grievances. Instead, everyone was eager to improve the service level.

The school year has started, and students and single teachers from out of town bring cold food from home, and the cooks process and heat it for free. Summer has arrived, and the cooks make ice pops, soda, plum juice, and frozen soy milk, providing them to teachers and students at low prices. When the Mid-Autumn Festival arrives, the cooks give each teacher and student a homemade moon cake. During the winter vacation, they send two bags of snacks as New Year's gifts to the parents of each student. When the snow covers the ground and it is difficult to walk, without orders from the leadership or requests from the students, they quietly clean the paths from the student dormitories to the canteen.

The dedicated service of the logistics staff is like a burning flame, melting the dissatisfaction and barriers that once existed between them and the teachers and students, replacing them with a new, friendly, and harmonious relationship. Once, when the canteen provided free additional meals for the students and found that the fish had an unusual smell, they decided to deduct the monthly bonus of the responsible person according to the contract. After learning this, the students spontaneously elected representatives to find the school's party committee and requested not to punish the cooks. They said, "The masters work hard for us to eat well every day, getting up early and staying up late, which is already very hard. Punishing them for a single incident of stale fish is inhumane, and we disagree!"

    温暖的后院
    ——记武汉水利电力学院后勤工作
    新华社记者　崔葆章　唐卫彬
    武汉水利电力学院在武汉地区30多所高校中，长期以来，并不太显眼。近两年，校园的沉默突然间被打破了：湖北省教委在全省高等院校中推广他们的经验，国家教委派专人前来考察和总结……。
    这里究竟发生了些什么？
    武汉大学生都说“吃在水院”，周末他们常聚到这里来“打牙祭”
    在中国，素有“吃在广州”的谚语。而在武汉地区高校的10万名大学生中，近几年却流传着另外一个说法——“吃在水院”。
    春暖花开时节，记者慕名来到这个学院。我们走遍了4个学生食堂的餐厅、厨房、面包房、冷饮部、小卖部、豆腐坊、养猪场，发现每个食堂一日三餐的主食都在10种以上，仅是面条，就有汤面、炒面、打卤面、牛肉面、延边凉面、武汉热干面、兰州拉面和山西刀削面等10来个花样。中、晚餐时，案板上密密麻麻地摆满了高、中、低档各种荤素菜，南北风味，琳琅满目，数一数，竟有50多种。
    几位正在吃饭的学生，十分得意地告诉记者：“我们每人每月只花30元左右就能吃到大约50元的伙食，比武汉其它高校便宜20％左右。”炊事员们起早贪黑养猪、磨豆腐、腌咸菜，每年把这些副业生产纯收入的80％补贴了学生伙食，仅1988年统计，6000多名就餐学生平均每人每月就享受到食堂补贴6.8元。所以，在近年来物价大幅度上涨的情况下，水院食堂能够做到荤菜售价略有提高，素菜保持每份1角左右的水平不变。难怪每逢周末和节假日，武汉市许多高校的学生纷纷赶到这里聚餐，打牙祭。
    解教授记错钟点误了车。司机急驶27公里，让他在下个站口搭上那班车
    电力系教授解广润去北京开会，记错了火车时间，司机徐祖元将他送到武昌站时，火车刚刚开走。这时，徐祖元抄近路急驰27公里，使解教授在下一个火车站汉口搭上了那趟火车。汽车队实行调度和司机昼夜值班制。几年来，汽车队去车站码头接送人，没有误过一次车船。
    清晨，年近古稀的老教授做早饭时，发现煤气罐没气了。正在着急，送煤气的铃声在院里响了，老教授赶忙走到窗口向楼下喊道：“同志，请送一罐到502房间！”3分钟后，煤气站工人扛着一满罐煤气爬上五楼，送到老教授厨房里。——几年来，学校煤气站坚持一日三次，风雨无阻地把煤气罐送到教工宿舍，楼层再高，也只收2角钱的劳务费；而且，每罐煤气的成本已由8元逐渐涨到14元，仍然只向职工收费3.3元，仅此一项，后勤部门每年都要向教职工支付煤气补贴8万多元。
    一次，学生代表向院领导提意见，说学生公寓的棉被对个子高的同学来说太短了；没过几天，专门去军工厂特制的长棉被就送到了高个学生床上，速度之快出人意外，感动得学生们直说“谢谢”。
    1987年院领导与300名师生的对话会上，师生们对后勤工作的发言主要是赞扬，仅有的3条意见都是细微小事；而1984年那次全院教代会时，400条提案和意见中，有2／3都是关于后勤工作的。
    后勤部门在改革中由一块冰变成一团火，熔化了与学生的隔膜
    4年前，水院拨给后勤部门的行政经费每年都有180—200万元，占全院事业费可分配部分的1／3以上，后勤部门还经常为争经费同教学科研部门闹矛盾；学生们经常为伙食的质次价高与炊事员闹纠纷，甚至几十人一起打群架；“少爷司机”上班打扑克、聊天，连书记、院长要车也没保证；教学和生活设施欠账累累……
    1985年开始，水院后勤部门试行“政企分开”，走上了企业化管理的道路，经济效益逐年增加。1988年，后勤部门从学校支取的年行政经费比改革前减少100万元左右，承包单位560多名职工的工资、福利费等不再由学校拨付，并为学校净增收节支300多万元。日益增长的经济效益犹如源头活水，不断增强着学院的经济实力。
    由于在后勤改革中，始终坚持了为教学科研和师生员工生活服务的宗旨，坚持了强有力的思想政治工作，使“讲理想、比服务、爱集体、赛贡献”在后勤部门形成了新风尚。所以，几年来，当后勤部门把创收节支的绝大部分资金用于学校建设和增添服务项目，而职工个人收入的增长却微乎其微时，不仅没人抱怨、发牢骚，反而争先恐后提高服务水平。
    开学了，外地学生和单身教师从家里带来生冷食品，炊事员免费代为加工加热；夏天来了，炊事员自制冰棒、汽水、酸梅汤、冰冻豆浆等冷饮，廉价供给师生；中秋节到了，炊事员们向每个师生员工赠送一份自己精制的月饼；放寒假时，则向每个学生家长写一封慰问信，送两袋点心作为年礼；大雪铺地，行路艰难，领导没下命令，学生没提要求，他们却默默地把学生宿舍通往食堂的道路打扫得干干净净……。
    后勤职工的精心服务，仿佛一团团炽热的火焰，融化了他们与师生之间曾经存在的不满和隔膜，代之以崭新的亲切和谐的人际关系。一次，食堂为学生免费加餐时，发现鱼有异味，决定按承包条例扣当事人全月奖金；学生们知道后，自发推选代表找到院党委，请求不要处分炊事员，他们说：“师傅们为我们吃饱吃好，每天起早贪黑，够辛苦的了，偶尔一次鱼不新鲜就处罚，不近人情，我们不同意！”
