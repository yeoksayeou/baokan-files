Title: Plants' "Love" and "Hate"

Scientists have discovered that in the natural world, plants also have "love" and "hate."

Scientists have proven through experiments that onions and carrots are good friends; the scents they emit can drive away each other's pests. Soybeans like to be with castor beans, and the scent castor beans release makes the bean weevils that harm soybeans wary. Planting violets in vineyards allows them to "coexist peacefully," and the grapes produced have a more intense aroma.

Some plants, however, have deep-seated enmities and are "incompatible." Cabbage and mustard are sworn enemies; if they grow together, both are harmed. Daffodils and lily-of-the-valley cannot be neighbors; if they grow together, they will both perish. White-flowered jasmine growing with wheat, corn, and sunflowers will result in no harvest for the wheat and other crops. Cucumbers and tomatoes, buckwheat and corn, sorghum and sesame are all incompatible pairs. The "love" and "hate" among plants, in other words, the compatibility and incompatibility of plants, is a new and emerging field of science—biochemical ecology.

    植物的“爱”和“恨”
    科学家们发现，在自然界中，植物亦有“爱”和“恨”。
    科学家经过实验证明：洋葱和胡萝卜是好朋友，它们发出的气味可驱逐相互的害虫。大豆喜欢与蓖麻相处，蓖麻散发的气味使危害大豆的金龟子望而生畏。葡萄园里种上紫罗兰，彼此能“友好共存”，结出的葡萄香味更浓。
    有些植物间也有“血海深仇”，彼此“水火不相容”。卷心菜和芥菜是一对仇敌，相处后两败俱伤。水仙和铃兰休想为邻，长在一起会“同归于尽”。白花草木樨与小麦、玉米、向日葵共同生活，会使小麦等作物一无所获。黄瓜和蕃茄、荞麦和玉米、高粱和芝麻等都是冤家对头。植物的“爱”和“恨”，也就是植物的相生和相克，这是一门新兴科学——生物化学群落学。
