The arrest of Xiao Bin, who spread rumors and misled the public, has educated many people. However, some people still do not understand: "Isn't this 'speakers are guilty'?" This viewpoint is worth analyzing.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our Party has abolished the bad habits of arbitrarily "striking with sticks" and arbitrarily "labeling," and has once again emphasized the basic principle of democratic life that "speakers are not guilty." This has encouraged people to speak the truth, liberated people's thoughts, and achieved the goal of opening up more channels for expression. However, with the spread of bourgeois liberalization, some people think that "speakers are not guilty" means that one can speak without responsibility. Even fewer people with ulterior motives see an opportunity and create various rumors, even openly spouting wild words to viciously attack the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. Their words have long gone beyond the scope of democracy and the rule of law, seriously disrupting and destroying social order.

Everyone knows that once a word is spoken, it will have a certain social effect. In a situation where people do not know the truth, any irresponsible remark can deceive them and even fuel unrest. Hasn't everything that happened in Beijing since mid-April proven this? From this perspective, "speakers are not guilty" does not mean "spreading rumors is not guilty." The Criminal Law of our country stipulates that for those who engage in counter-revolutionary incitement and fabricate facts to defame and slander others, their criminal responsibilities will be pursued according to law. Xiao Bin's "crime through speech" is entirely justified. Can we really ignore and not pursue those who speak against the four cardinal principles, disrupt social stability, sow discord between the Party and the people, and speak against the Party and socialism, just because "speakers are not guilty"?

Of course, in the political life within the people, we should continue to promote democracy and open up more channels for expression. We should still implement the principle that "speakers are not guilty." For those who, during this political struggle, have spoken some incorrect words due to not knowing the truth or not fully understanding the situation, we should distinguish them from those who maliciously incite with counter-revolutionary intentions.

    “言者无罪”析
    易成友
    造谣惑众的肖斌被捕，教育了很多人。但也有一些人表示不理解：“哎呀！这不是‘言者有罪’了吗？”这种看法值得分析。
    自十一届三中全会以来，我们党废止了乱“打棍子”、乱“扣帽子”的恶习，重新强调“言者无罪”这一民主生活的基本原则，鼓励讲真话，解放了人们的思想，达到了广开言路的目的。但是，随着资产阶级自由化思潮的泛滥，有些人以为“言者无罪”就是说话可以不负责任，更有少数别有用心的人见有机可乘，便制造种种谣言，甚至公然口吐狂言，恶毒攻击中国共产党，攻击社会主义制度。他们的所言早已越出了民主和法制的轨道，严重地干扰和破坏了社会秩序。
    大家知道，一语既出，总会产生一定的社会效果。在人们不明真相的情况下，任何一句不顾事实的瞎说，都可以使他们上当受骗，以至助长动乱。4月中旬以来，首都北京所发生的一切不正说明了这一点吗！由此看来，“言者无罪”并不等于“造谣无罪”。我国刑法规定，对于进行反革命煽动和捏造事实诬陷诽谤他人的行为，都要依法追究当事人的刑事责任。肖斌“因言获罪”，是理所当然的。难道因为“言者无罪”，就连违反四项基本原则的胡言，破坏安定团结的乱言，离间党群关系的谎言，反党反社会主义的狂言，都可以不管、不追究吗？
    当然，在人民内部的政治生活中，我们还是要继续发扬民主，广开言路，还是应该实行“言者无罪”。对于在这次政治斗争中因不明真相或一时认识不清而说过某些错话的人，也要把他们与抱着反革命目的进行恶意煽动的人区别开来。
