Shanghai has started the production of optical fibers. Using a pair of glass fibers as thin as a hair, telephone lines can be made to support 40,000 people or 20,000 pairs of telephones simultaneously. This new material, known as optical fiber, has recently begun production at the new Shanghai Glass Factory.

The development and production of optical fibers is one of Shanghai's 14 major new technology development projects. In 1986, the Shanghai Glass Factory imported optical fiber production equipment and technology from France and Switzerland. After domestic matching, digestion, and absorption, it began batch trial production in March this year. It has produced over 1,000 kilometers of optical fiber, of which 400 kilometers have been delivered to relevant departments for use.

    上海开始生产光导纤维
    据新华社上海电（通讯员徐松华）用一对似头发丝粗细的“玻璃纤维”，制成电话线，可以供4万人、2万对电话同时通话。这种被称为光导纤维的新材料，日前在上海新沪玻璃厂正式投入生产。
    研制和生产光导纤维，这已列为上海市14项重大新技术开发项目之一。1986年新沪玻璃厂从法国和瑞士引进光纤生产设备和技术，并通过国内配套、消化吸收，今年3月投入批量试生产，已生产出光纤1000多公里，其中400公里交付有关部门使用。
