Two deputy directors of the Hunan Provincial Tax Bureau were investigated for accepting high-standard hospitality, indulging in extravagant dining, receiving gifts, and squandering public funds during a job title evaluation. The provincial supervisory authorities have initiated an investigation into the matter.

In July and August of last year, two deputy directors, Yang Baoqiu and Li Li, led an evaluation team from the Hunan Provincial Tax Bureau for mid-level job title evaluations. The team spent a total of 84,239 yuan on hospitality expenses, including 24,872 yuan on accommodation, 28,831 yuan on meals, 11,852 yuan on hospitality items (such as cigarettes, beverages, and fruits), 12,143 yuan on gifts, and 6,540 yuan on allowances, averaging 1,619 yuan per day.

During the evaluation in Changsha City, despite the tax bureau's personnel reform office having adequate office conditions, the team insisted on staying in high-end hotel rooms (ranging from 70 to 180 yuan per person per day).

The evaluation team frequently attended banquets, drinking high-end liquors and smoking imported cigarettes. Out of the 14 team members, 14 received gifts from local and municipal tax bureaus, including woolen fabrics, blankets, down comforters, safes, and tableware. Yang Baoqiu and Li Li, as deputy directors, led the way in dining and receiving gifts, each accepting gifts from 12 local and municipal areas.

    利用评审职称吃喝受礼挥霍公款
    湖南税务局两领导被查处
    本报长沙7月14日电  记者杜若原报道：湖南省税务局两位副局长在进行职称现场评审期间，接受高标准招待，大肆吃喝受礼，挥霍公款。省监察部门已对此事立案调查。
    去年7、8月间，由杨保秋、李立两个副局长带队的湖南省税务局中级职称评审组，共花掉接待经费84239元，其中住宿费24872元，伙食费28831元，招待费（烟、饮料、水果等）11852元，礼品费12143元，津贴费6540元，平均每天花掉公款1619元。
    这个评审组在长沙市评审时，尽管税务局职改办有较好的办公条件，但他们仍住宾馆高档房间（每人每天住房费70元至180元）。
    评审组几乎天天赴宴，喝高级名酒，抽进口香烟。组里有14人接受地、市税务局的礼品，包括毛料、毛毯、鸭绒被、密码箱、餐具等。杨保秋、李立同志身为副局长，带头吃喝、受礼，分别接受12个地、市的礼品。
