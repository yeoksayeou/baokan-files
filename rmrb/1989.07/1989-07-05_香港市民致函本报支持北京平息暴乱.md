Editor,

We are five ordinary residents of Hong Kong. With great indignation, we condemn the counter-revolutionary rioters who created chaos in the capital.

The People's Liberation Army of China, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, is the army of the people and the champion of justice. The troops in Beijing have taken decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rioters, not only to quell the riot and ensure the peace and security of the capital's residents, but also to safeguard the unity of all ethnic groups in the country and ensure that the country continues to advance along the correct path set by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. All Chinese people with a sense of justice and responsibility for the fate of the nation will support the righteous actions of the People's Liberation Army. Those who have been temporarily misled by counter-revolutionary propaganda and incorrect reports (Beijing incident) and do not know the truth will, as they gradually learn the truth, stand on the side of the Chinese people and the Liberation Army, and support the Party and the government's decision to suppress the riot.

Here, we hope that some of the young people in Beijing who do not know the truth will recognize that a small group of ambitious plotters are using students to raise the banner of "democracy" and "freedom," but their true intention is to overthrow the government of the Republic. Think about it, if they overthrow the people's government and overthrow the Communist Party, what kind of situation will a country with 1.1 billion people face? In a word: the country will have no peace, the people will suffer, and the nation will be divided. All Chinese people with a conscience should use legitimate means to help the Party and the people's government overcome difficulties and do a good job.

The fate of Hong Kong and the mainland is closely related. It is natural for Hong Kong compatriots to care about the Beijing incident. However, some people in Hong Kong are stirring up trouble, using foreign forces to pressure China, and some are even supporting illegal organizations in the mainland to engage in anti-government activities in various ways. Some even boast of making Hong Kong a "base" for anti-Beijing government activities. Their ugly behavior is gradually being recognized, and some enlightened people have clearly opposed the idea of pulling Hong Kong into the anti-communist, anti-China camp.

We feel that maintaining Hong Kong's stability and prosperity and implementing "one country, two systems" requires the efforts of all parties. China, Britain, and Hong Kong residents all have responsibilities. Those who play with fire in Hong Kong will reap the consequences. Kind-hearted Hong Kong residents should be vigilant against those with ulterior motives.

    香港市民致函本报支持北京平息暴乱
    编辑先生：
    我们是香港五位普通市民，现怀着无比愤怒的心情，谴责一小撮反革命分子在首都制造反革命暴乱的罪行。
    中国人民解放军是中国共产党领导下的人民子弟兵，是正义之师。北京的戒严部队对暴乱分子采取的果断措施，不仅平息了反革命暴乱，保证首都人民在和平、安全环境中生活，而且保证了全国各族人民的团结，保证国家继续沿着中共十一届三中全会制订的正确路线前进。有正义感和对民族命运负责的中国人都会支持中国人民解放军的正义行动。一些暂时受反革命舆论、错误报道（北京事件）蒙蔽而不明真相的人们，在逐渐了解事情真相后，是会站在中国人民和解放军一边的，是会支持党和政府为平息暴乱所作出的决策的。
    在此，希望一些不明真相的北京青年，要认清一小撮野心家、阴谋家利用学生打着“争民主”“争自由”的旗帜，其实质是要推翻共和国政府的本质。大家想一想，如果由他们推翻人民政府，打倒共产党，拥有十一亿人口的中国将会出现什么样的局面，一句话可概括：国无宁日，人民遭殃，民族分裂。一切有良心的中国人都应用正当方法协助党和人民政府克服困难，做好工作。
    香港和祖国大陆的命运息息相关。香港同胞关心北京事件理所当然。但是香港某些人兴风作浪，借助外国势力对中国施压，有的人甚至以各种方式支持内地非法组织进行反政府活动，某些人甚至扬言把香港作为反北京政府的“基地”，他们的丑恶言行逐渐被人认识，一些有识之士已明确反对将香港拉入反共反华的队伍中。
    我们感到，保持香港安定繁荣，实现“一国两制”，要靠各方面努力，中国、英国有责任，香港市民也有责任。在香港玩火的人必食其果。善良的香港市民对别有用心之人应有所警惕。
