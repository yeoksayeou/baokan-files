    Party discipline and regulations, along with institutional constraints, have ensured that none of the 3,780 party and government officials in Jiahe County, Hunan Province, have built private houses.

    Influenced by the trend of building private houses in society, some party and government officials in Jiahe County have also planned to build private houses in recent years. Some have already purchased construction materials, while others have secured "auspicious" land. Just in Chengguan Town, 378 applications from party and government officials to build private houses were submitted.

    In response to this situation, the county committee organized a study class for deputy section-level and above officials, focusing on "party discipline and regulations" and "national conditions and policies." They also launched the campaign "Be a Public Servant, Do Practical Work for Reform, Create a Clean Government." The county committee and county government, in accordance with the relevant regulations of the State Council, issued a regulation in the previous year stating that party and government officials building private houses in urban areas must follow "unified planning, unified arrangement, unified approval, unified joint construction, unified design, and unified funds deposited in the bank."

    The leading officials in Jiahe County have taken the lead in implementing the county's regulations. Among the 813 section-level officials and 35 county-level officials, none have built private houses. Hu Xiangsheng, a member of the county committee and chairman of the county political consultative conference, was repeatedly urged by his relatives to build a private house in the county seat, with offers of financial assistance. He politely declined. Last year, Li Guangqiu, the county discipline inspection committee secretary, had five nephews who proposed to build a private house for him. Three nephews working in rural construction teams said, "You don't have money, we will provide it." Two nephews who were village officials said, "We will take care of the land and labor, and it won't take two months to build a new house." Li Guangqiu told them, "It's not possible. Once I start building a house, I will be distant from the people." Lei Yuanqi, the director of the county land and resources bureau, lives with his family of five in a 30-square-meter basement. Some comrades advised him to secure a plot of land and build a house in Chengguan Town, but he did not agree.

    Due to the leadership's example, the five officials who had purchased land to build private houses have all returned the land they had secured. The party and government officials who had originally applied to build private houses have gradually given up the idea of building houses.

    嘉禾党政干部无人建私房
    新华社长沙7月17日电  （通讯员周玉林、杜相成）湖南省嘉禾县3780名党政干部无一人营建私房。
    受社会上营建私房风的影响，嘉禾县的一些党政干部近年来也积极筹划为自己建私房。有的已购“三材”，有的征购了“风水宝地”，仅城关镇就收到了党政干部申请建私房的报告378份。
    针对这种情况，县委举办副科级以上干部学习班，进行“党风党纪”和“国情国策”的教育，并开展了“做人民公仆、办改革实事、创廉洁机关”的活动。县委、县政府根据国务院的有关规定，于去年作出了党政干部在城镇建私房要“统一规划，统一安排，统一审批，统一联建，统一设计，统一资金存入银行”的规定。
    嘉禾县的领导干部带头执行县里的规定。全县813名科级干部和35名县级干部无一人营建私房。县委常委、县政协主席胡祥生的亲友们几次劝他在县城建私房，并愿意资助，他婉言谢绝了。去年，县纪委书记李光球的5个侄子提出要给他建私房。3个在农村基建队负责的侄子说：“你没钱，我们出。”两个当村干部的侄子说：“我们负责地皮和劳力，不要两个月，保证住新房。”李光球对他们说：“搞不得，我一旦盖起了房子，就远离了群众。”县国土局局长雷渊旗全家5口人租用一间30平方米的地下室，也有同志劝他搞块地皮，在城关建栋房子，他没有同意。
    由于领导带头，全县已购土地准备建私房的5名干部，都已退回了征购的地皮，原申请建私房的党政干部，已陆续放弃了建房的念头。
