Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 19th.

Shanghai Xinzhonghua Machinery Factory has independently designed and developed a new generation of energy-efficient refrigerators—the Aerospace-brand BCD-177A. After testing by the Beijing National Home Appliance Quality Supervision and Testing Center and the Shanghai Home Appliance Testing Station, all indicators meet the A-level standards set by the national refrigerator quality classification and grading regulations.

Especially noteworthy is the daily power consumption, which is stably controlled below 0.78 kWh, with an average daily power consumption of 0.71 kWh, leading among current domestic refrigerators of the same type.

Shanghai Xinzhonghua Machinery Factory is a major manufacturer of artificial satellites and launch vehicles in China, with strong technical capabilities.

This year, the production plan for the Aerospace-brand BCD-177A is 100,000 units, which will save the country 10,950,000 kWh of electricity annually.
