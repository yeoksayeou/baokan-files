    Wu Lengxi recently published an article titled "The Role of the News and Opinion Industry is Worth Reflecting On" in the *People's Political Consultative Conference News*. The article points out that the news industry's promotion of bourgeois liberalization has two characteristics. These two characteristics are:

    First, pluralism. They advocate that the roles, functions, or tasks of newspapers, news, radio, and television are multifaceted: propagating policies, reflecting public opinion, supervising public opinion, imparting knowledge, exchanging information, entertainment, introducing products, etc. You cannot say that these various tasks and functions are unreasonable, but the problem lies in the purpose and result of doing so, which dilutes or even eliminates the primary tasks and functions. You emphasize guidance, and they emphasize mass appeal, knowledge, and entertainment; you emphasize running a party newspaper, and they emphasize group-run newspapers, civilian-run newspapers, and individually-run newspapers; you emphasize political unity with the central authorities, and they emphasize reflecting diverse voices. In short, they submerge the primary nature, tasks, and roles of newspapers in a multitude of demands, calling it pluralism, but in reality, it is to cancel out the primary tasks of newspapers and oppose the idea that newspapers are the party's mouthpiece.

    Second, neutrality. This is a hypocritical tactic. That is, they vigorously promote a theory, defining the news industry with a neutral definition that is neither acidic nor alkaline. Specifically, they call newspapers, news agencies, radio stations, and television stations all "media." You cannot say they are not media; this is something that different classes or interest groups can accept, but what problem can these four words solve? It is like saying that newspapers are newsprint. It can only show that this neutral definition is to avoid the class nature or political tendency of news tools. Because the essence of the problem lies in what to propagate, for whom to propagate, by whom to propagate, and how to propagate. Here, it is inevitable that there will be differences due to different tendencies, and due to the differences in class, stratum, and social group interests. Those who advocate for media are hypocritically concealing their purposes, and are deceiving the masses with so-called "truth," "objectivity," and "justice."

    What is "truth"? Voice of America and many newspapers in Taiwan and Hong Kong say that the Tiananmen Square massacre is the truth, while we say that no one died in Tiananmen Square is the truth.

    What is "objectivity"? Voice of America says that the PLA indiscriminately killed civilians is objective, while we say that after counter-revolutionary rioters killed PLA soldiers, the PLA was forced to retaliate is objective.

    What is "justice"? Voice of America calls the turmoil a "patriotic student movement" or "democratic movement" and calls it "justice," while we call the activities of political conspirators who instigated, planned, and manipulated the anti-party and anti-socialist activities "turmoil" and later developed into counter-revolutionary riots, which is true justice.

    It can be seen that the so-called "truth," "objectivity," and "justice" have different standards for different classes and social groups. We communists use the standards of dialectical materialism and historical materialism to view truth, objectivity, and justice. We speak of the essential truth, the objective reality of things, and justice that takes the interests of the people as the criterion.

    The above two characteristics also, to a considerable extent, reflect the characteristics of liberalization in the entire ideological field. Take pluralism, for example: in economics, they use the existence of various economic components to advocate for private ownership; in politics, they use economic pluralism to advocate for a multi-party system without the leadership of the Communist Party; in ideology, they use economic pluralism to advocate for liberalization that denies Marxism as the guiding ideology. Take neutrality, for example: in economics, they advocate that commodity economy has no social attributes; in politics, they advocate that state institutions (government, military, police, courts, prisons) have no class attributes.

    吴冷西撰文分析新闻界的某些错误观点
    多元化、中性化与自由化
    本报讯　吴冷西同志最近在《人民政协报》发表了题为《新闻舆论界的作用令人深思》的文章。文章指出新闻界搞资产阶级自由化有两个特点。这两个特点是：
    一是多元化。他们鼓吹报刊、新闻、广播、电视的作用或功能或任务是多方面的：宣传政策、反映舆情、舆论监督、传授知识、交流信息、娱乐消遣、介绍商品等等。你不能说这样多种任务和功能没有道理，但问题在于这样做的目的和结果就把主要任务和主要功能冲淡了，或者简直就冲掉了。你提指导性，他提群众性、知识性、娱乐性；你提办好党报，他提团体办报、民间办报、个人办报；你提在政治上同中央保持一致，他提反映多种声音。总之是使报刊的主要性质、任务、作用淹没在多种多样的要求之中，美其名曰多元化，实际上是取消报刊的主要任务，反对报纸是党的喉舌的提法。
    二是中性化。这是一种虚伪的手法。就是说，他们极力宣扬一种理论，给新闻事业定出一个既不是酸性，也不是碱性，而是中性的定义。具体说，把报纸、通讯社、广播电台、电视台通通叫做传播媒介。你不能说它们不是传播媒介，这是各种不同阶级或不同利益集团都可以接受的，但这四个字能解决什么问题呢？这等于说报纸是新闻纸一样。它只能说明，这个中性定义是为了回避新闻工具的阶级性或政治倾向性。因为问题的实质在于传播什么、为谁传播、由谁传播、怎样传播。这里不可避免地因倾向不同而不同，因阶级、阶层、社会集团利益的不同而不同。那些传播媒介的鼓吹者，就是这样虚伪地掩盖他们的目的，就是这样以所谓“真实”、“客观”、“公正”来欺骗群众的。
    什么是“真实”？美国之音、台港不少报刊说血洗天安门广场是真实，我们说天安门广场没死一个人是真实。
    什么是“客观”？美国之音说解放军乱杀群众是客观，我们说反革命暴徒杀害解放军后，解放军被迫还击是客观。
    什么是“公正”？美国之音把动乱说成是“爱国学生运动”或“民主运动”叫做“公正”，我们把政治阴谋分子煽动、策划和操纵的反党反社会主义的活动称之为“动乱”以及后来发展为反革命暴乱，这才是真正的公正。
    可见所谓“真实”、“客观”、“公正”，不同阶级、不同社会集团都是有不同标准的。我们共产党人是以辩证唯物主义、历史唯物主义的世界观和历史观的标准来看待真实、客观、公正的，我们讲的是本质的真实，事物本来面目的客观，以人民利益为准绳的公正。
    以上两个特色，也在相当程度上反映了整个意识形态领域自由化的特点。拿多元化来说，经济上以多种经济成分为由鼓吹私有制，政治上以经济多元化为由鼓吹没有共产党领导的多党制；思想上以经济多元化为由鼓吹否定马克思主义为指导思想的自由化。拿中性化来说，经济上鼓吹商品经济无社会属性，政治上鼓吹国家机构（政府、军队、警察、法庭、监狱）也没有阶级属性。
