Tighten the Grip on "Medicine Bottles"

Reporters Gao Xiuzhen and Tian Lansuo

This year, the Chinese pharmaceutical market has seen a severe shortage of many effective drugs crucial for saving critically ill patients and some commonly used medications, causing concern among some medical staff and drug management personnel. They have written to our newspaper to report this issue.

Drug Shortages: Hospitals in Crisis

One day in May, we visited the hematology outpatient department of Beijing Medical University Third Hospital. We saw many leukemia patients surrounding the doctor, all eager to buy hydroxyurea, a drug used to treat leukemia. Due to the lack of supply, Dr. Dou from the hematology department appeared helpless. He anxiously told the reporter, "Beijing Medical University Third Hospital only has 3 bottles of hydroxyurea left. Who should we give these to?" Patients shared their difficulties with us. A patient named Chen Junsheng, who is just over 30 years old, has been suffering from leukemia for 12 years. For years, he has been taking hydroxyurea, which has helped control his condition. Due to the shortage of hydroxyurea, several of his friends had to stop taking the drug and passed away prematurely. Now, he too has to stop taking hydroxyurea, and an unfortunate fate awaits him. Currently, most leukemia patients in this hospital have stopped using hydroxyurea, and their conditions are worsening. Doctors feel the frustration of "a good cook without rice." Recently, Professor Hu Yamei, the director of Beijing Children's Hospital, who studies childhood leukemia, proposed giving up her research due to the inability to obtain treatment drugs.

Currently, in addition to the shortage of anticancer drugs, other medications are also in short supply. Beijing is short of over 160 types of drugs. In Beijing Anding Hospital, only about 40% of patients with schizophrenia can receive chlorpromazine. Some patients cannot take chlorpromazine in time, leading to a relapse. Beijing Anding Hospital is also short of antiepileptic drugs like phenobarbital, leaving doctors helpless when patients have seizures. Peking Union Medical College Hospital's pharmacy is short of over 100 types of drugs, including commonly used drugs like berberine, which frequently go out of stock. In Shanghai, some hospitals have run out of over 30 types of the most commonly used drugs, and over 130 types of drugs cannot meet the demand. The drug shortage situation in Tianjin, Zhejiang, Hubei, and other places is also very severe, with continuous urgent reports to the Ministry of Health. Some hospitals have had to close due to drug shortages and stop performing surgeries. In most rural clinics in Xianfeng County, Hubei, even common drugs like analgesic pills, aminopyrine, and aspirin are out of stock. The drug shortage situation in remote areas is even more severe. A relevant official from the Ministry of Health said:

Currently, the shortage of commonly used antibiotics, sulfonamides, and antipyretic analgesics is unprecedented since the founding of the nation. This problem must be addressed urgently. Drug shortages are causing hospitals to be in crisis, but what is the situation of the drug manufacturing plants?

Price Distortions: Product Losses

In recent years, the state's planned allocation of raw materials to domestic pharmaceutical factories has been decreasing yearly. The state plans to ensure the supply of 30 types of drugs, but relevant departments only issue production quotas without allocating raw materials. For example, Shandong New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory relies on the market for 90% of its raw materials. For the production of acetylsalicylic acid, the factory consumes 1,300 tons of aniline annually, but the state only allocated 50 tons in the first half of the year; 600 tons of sodium chloride are consumed annually, but only 25 tons were allocated in the first half of the year; 2,000 tons of methanol are consumed annually, but only 150 tons were allocated in the first half of the year; and the factory has to purchase fixed alkali, cyclopentanone, and toluene for drug production. Jinan Pharmaceutical Factory produces vitamin C and phenacetin, which are popular in domestic and international markets, earning over $40 million annually. However, the raw materials for these two drugs are also entirely dependent on the factory's "finding rice to cook." Recently, the State Pharmaceutical Administration issued a task to this factory to produce 40 tons of phenacetin, but the factory still has not received the planned raw materials.

Due to the tight supply of drug raw materials, the prices of raw materials have skyrocketed, with some raw materials experiencing a three-digit percentage increase. For example, the Northeast Pharmaceutical Group produces over 430 types of drugs annually, requiring over 20 tons of chemical raw materials. This factory has to spend an additional 46 million yuan due to the price increase of chemical raw materials. Some pharmaceutical enterprises, in order to export more drugs and earn more foreign exchange, have exacerbated the domestic drug raw material shortage. Jinan Chemical Factory produces orthonitrochlorobenzene, exporting about 500 tons annually at $800 per ton. However, just a few hundred meters away, Jinan Pharmaceutical Factory has to import this raw material at $1,700 per ton due to the inability to purchase it domestically. The significant increase in the price of chemical raw materials has far exceeded the enterprise's ability to self-digest and bear. Statistics show that from 1985 to 1988, Shandong New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory spent an additional 57.05 million yuan due to the price increase of raw materials and energy. In 1989, this factory's raw material and energy price increase amounted to 32 million yuan. In 1988, Shanghai Second Pharmaceutical Factory reduced consumption and costs by over 100 million yuan, but the price increase of 21 types of chemical raw materials resulted in an additional payment of 180 million yuan. In 1989, the factory's chemical raw material price increase is expected to reach 217 million yuan.

This situation has led to some pharmaceutical enterprises producing drugs not only without profit but also with significant losses. Last year, Shenyang produced nearly 90 types of drugs, with 35 types incurring losses. Shandong New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory's 16 types of antipyretic and analgesic drugs have 14 types incurring losses, and the other two types are on the brink of loss. For example, the state price of aspirin tablets is 12 yuan per kilogram, but the market price of salicylic acid, an intermediate for producing aspirin, is 20 yuan per kilogram, leading to the abnormal phenomenon of producing aspirin being less profitable than selling salicylic acid. This year, Shandong New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory is planned to produce 1,200 tons of aspirin according to the state plan. This alone will result in a loss of over 100 million yuan for the factory annually. Currently, they have arranged to stop or reduce the production of economically unprofitable drugs such as acetylsalicylic acid, calcium gluconate, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride.

Hydroxyurea tablets for treating leukemia are produced exclusively by Jinan Pharmaceutical Factory. The factory director told the reporter that due to various reasons, this drug was stopped in 1985. Beijing Pharmaceutical Factory No. 2, which produces dopamine for treating heart disease (only two factories in the country produce it), has stopped production for 2 years; drugs for treating tuberculosis such as ethambutol and isoniazid are also in a semi-stopped state.

Some pharmaceutical factories have their reasons for doing this. Currently, each pharmaceutical factory is operating on a contract basis, with the main indicator being profit and tax. The completion of the contract task is mainly judged by economic benefits. To complete the profit and tax target, improve staff welfare, and not arbitrarily increase drug prices, some factories have to stop or reduce the production of drugs with significant losses. Thus, some drugs have gone out of stock. According to investigations, more than half of the drugs currently out of stock in the domestic market are of the type that the more produced, the more lost. If drug prices are not adjusted, the situation of drug shortages in society will not improve in the face of significant increases in energy and raw material prices.

Funding Shortages: Capital Turnover Issues

Product losses make enterprises reluctant to produce, while funding shortages make enterprises unable to produce. According to statistics on 18 pharmaceutical enterprises nationwide, the normal production requires 7.6 billion yuan in working capital, but the current shortfall is 1.95 billion yuan. Shandong New Hua Pharmaceutical Factory needs 420 million yuan in working capital to maintain current production, but the state allocation and bank loans only amount to 270 million yuan. Shanghai Huaihai Pharmaceutical Factory, due to a lack of funds, is unable to purchase raw materials, and the contraceptive drug production line has completely stopped. The severe shortage of funds has led many units to owe each other, worsening the drug production and supply situation. Currently, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Station owes related pharmaceutical enterprises 600 million yuan, while other units owe them 700 million yuan. This pharmaceutical station now has no funds to purchase goods, and the procurement plan cannot be fulfilled. In the fourth quarter of last year, Jining Antibiotic Factory in Shandong had over 10 tons of penicillin sodium injection raw drugs and over 10 million penicillin sodium injections in stock, while large hospitals in Jinan were short of penicillin. However, some hospitals in Jinan had no money to purchase drugs. Jining Antibiotic Factory had to stockpile a large amount of drugs. Currently, Jining Antibiotic Factory owes other units over 300 million yuan, while commercial units owe this factory 925 million yuan. This factory has to borrow money to pay workers' salaries.

The tight commercial funds have led to a significant reduction in drug inventory. Among the 40 main commonly used drugs, 17 types in Shandong Province have a drug shortage for less than 3 months of social consumption (the normal reserve should be enough for 6 months of social consumption), with 7 types having a drug inventory that can only meet 1 month of social consumption. Many commonly used drugs have become scarce. In Shanghai, 15 out of 50 emergency drugs have inventory levels below the warning line. Nationwide, commonly used antibiotics, sulfonamides, and antipyretic analgesics have disappeared from the first-level wholesale supply list. This inventory situation is worrying.

Relevant departments are concerned about the decline in drug production. They hope that higher-level departments will pay as much attention to patients' "medicine bottles" as they do to the "vegetable baskets." Some entrepreneurs say: To ensure people's medication, enterprises should strengthen management, increase production and savings, deepen reforms, and share the nation's worries. However, the state should also share the enterprises' burdens. It is suggested that relevant state departments take measures to ensure the funds needed by the pharmaceutical industry and change the unreasonable price ratio of drugs and raw materials.

    抓一抓“药瓶子”
    本报记者　高秀珍　田兰坡
    今年，我国药品市场上，许多疗效显著、抢救危重病人的救命药和一些常用药严重短缺，引起了一些医务工作人员和药品管理人员的焦虑。他们纷纷给本报写信，反映这一问题。
    药品脱销　医院告急
    今年5月的一天，我们来到北京医科大学第三医院血液科门诊室，只见不少白血病患者团团围住医生，争着要买治疗白血病的羟基脲药品。由于无药供应，血液科的窦大夫显得束手无策。他焦急地对记者说，北医三院只剩下3瓶羟基脲，这几瓶药给谁呢？患者们纷纷向我们谈了他们的苦衷。一位叫陈均生的患者今年30岁刚出头，却已有12年的白血病史。几年来，他一直服用羟基脲，使他的病情有所缓解。由于羟基脲短缺，几个病友被迫中断服用羟基脲，过早地离开了人世。目前，他也不得不停止服用羟基脲，不幸的命运正等待着他。眼下，这家医院大部分白血病患者停用了羟基脲，病情开始恶化。医生们深感“巧妇难为无米之炊”的苦处。前一时期，研究儿童白血病的北京市儿童医院院长胡亚美教授因买不到治疗白血病的药品，曾提出要放弃本专业的研究。
    当前，国内医疗单位除了抗癌药品短缺外，其它药品也十分紧缺。北京市短缺药品160多种。在北京市安定医院，治疗精神病患者的氯丙嗪只能满足约40％的患者。一些患者不能及时服用氯丙嗪，造成病情复发。北京市安定医院缺少治疗癫痫病的副醛药品，患者发病时，医生毫无办法。北京协和医院药房缺药100多种像黄连素等常用药也经常脱销。上海市一些医院有30多种最常用的药已经断档，130多种药已不能满足需要。天津、浙江、湖北等地缺药情况也十分严重，不断向卫生部发函告急。有的医院因缺药，只好关门停诊，停做手术。湖北咸丰县多数乡村卫生院连去痛片、安乃近、阿司匹林等常用药也脱销了。一些边远地区缺药的情况更加严重。卫生部有关同志说：
  目前，全国抗菌类、磺胺类、解热镇痛类等常用药品短缺情况是建国以来罕见的，解决这一问题刻不容缓。药品短缺，医院告急，而药品生产厂家的现状又是如何呢？
    价格失调　产品亏损
    近几年来，国家计划分配给国内药厂所需的原料逐年减少。国家计划保证供应的30种药品，有关部门只下达生产指标，却不管分配原材料。山东新华制药厂90％的原料靠市场调节。如这家厂生产乙酰水杨酸所需的苯胺全年消耗1300吨，而上半年国家只分配50吨；氯化钠全年消耗600吨，上半年只分配25吨；甲醇全年消耗2000吨，上半年只分配150吨；制药所需的固碱、环乙酮、甲苯等全靠厂里采购。济南市制药厂生产的维生素C、扑热息痛，畅销国内外市场，年创汇达400多万美元。但这两种药品生产所需的原料也全部依靠厂里“找米下锅”。最近，国家医药管理局给这家厂下达了生产40吨扑热息痛药品的任务，厂里仍然没有得到计划内的原料。
    由于药品原料供应紧张，原料的价格急剧上涨，有的原料价格上涨率达到3位数。例如，东北制药总厂每年生产430多种药品，需要20多吨化工原料。这个厂因化工原料涨价，就得多支出4600万元。一些制药企业为了多出口药品、多创汇，这更加剧国内药品原料的不足。济南化工厂生产对硝基氯化苯，每年出口约500吨，每吨800美元。而仅相距几百米的济南市制药厂因在国内买不到对硝基氯化苯，只好以每吨1700美元的价格进口这种原料。化工原料价格大幅度上涨，已大大超过企业自我消化吸收和承受能力。据统计，1985年至1988年，山东新华制药厂因原料、能源涨价，就多支出5705万元。1989年这个厂原材料和能源涨价款达3200万元。1988年，上海第二制药厂降低消耗、降低成本100多万元，但21种化工原料涨价就使这个厂多支付1800万元。1989年，这个厂化工原料涨价款预计达2170万元。
    这种现状，致使一些医药企业生产药品不仅无利，而且亏损严重。去年，沈阳市生产近90种药品，35种出现亏损。山东新华制药厂生产的16种解热镇痛类药品已有14种出现亏损，另外两种药也面临亏损的边缘。如阿司匹林药片，国家定价每公斤12元，但生产阿司匹林的中间体水杨酸原料市场价格每公斤为20元，造成生产阿司匹林不如卖水杨酸的不正常现象。今年，山东新华制药厂按国家计划要生产1200吨阿司匹林。仅此一项，这个厂全年要亏损100多万元。现在，他们对经济效益差的乙酰水杨酸、葡萄糖酸钙、醋酸、醋酐等药品，已作了停产或减产的安排。
    治疗白血病用的羟基脲药片是济南市制药厂独家生产的药品。这个厂的厂长告诉记者，由于种种原因，这种药于1985年就停产了。北京市制药二厂生产的专治心脏病的多巴胺（全国只有两家生产）已停产2年了；治疗肺结核的乙胺丁醇、异烟肼等药品，这家厂也处于半停产的状态。
    一些制药厂这样做，也是有难言的苦衷。现在，各个制药厂都搞承包，承包的主要指标是利税，承包任务完成的好坏，主要看经济效益。为了完成利税指标，提高职工福利，同时又不能随意提高药品价格，一些厂只好停止生产或少生产亏损较大的药品。这样，一些药品就出现脱销。经调查，现在，国内市场上脱销的药品一半以上属多生产多亏损的品种。如果药品价格不调整，在能源、原料价格大幅度上涨的情况下，社会上紧缺药品的状况不会缓减。
    资金奇缺　周转不灵
    产品亏损使企业不愿生产，资金奇缺却使企业无法生产。据对全国18家制药企业统计，正常生产所需流动资金7.6亿元，现差额达1.95亿元。山东新华制药厂维持现有生产，需要流动资金4200万元，但国家拨款、银行贷款只有2700万元。上海淮海制药厂因缺少资金，无力购进原料，避孕药生产线已全部停工。资金大量短缺，不少单位只好互相拖欠款，造成药品生产和供应情况日趋恶化。现在，上海医药站拖欠有关制药企业6000万元，而外单位拖欠他们7000万元。这家医药站现已无资金进货，收购计划也无法兑现。去年第四季度，山东济宁抗生素厂仓库积压青霉素钠针剂原料药10多吨、青霉素钠针剂1000多万支，而济南市各大医院青霉素紧缺。但是，济南市一些医院却无钱购买药品。济宁抗生素厂只好大量积压药品。现在济宁抗生素厂拖欠其他单位300多万元，而商业单位却拖欠这家厂925万元。这家厂只好借钱给工人发工资。
    商业资金紧张，造成药品库存大量下降。在40种主要常用药品中，山东省药品不足社会消耗3个月的有17种（正常储备应为满足社会消耗6个月），其中药品库存仅够社会消耗一个月的有7种，许多常用药品已成为紧缺药品。上海市50种急救药品，库存量在警戒线以下的有15种。全国抗菌素类、磺胺类、解热镇痛类等常用药品已在一级批发站供应表中消失了。这样的库存状况令人担忧。
    有关部门对药品生产滑坡深感忧虑。他们希望上级部门要像抓“菜篮子”一样来关心病人的“药瓶子”。一些企业家说：为了保证人民用药，企业应加强管理，增产节约，深化改革，为国分忧。但是，国家也要为企业分愁。建议国家有关部门采取措施，确保医药行业所需的资金，改变不合理的药品与原料的比价。
