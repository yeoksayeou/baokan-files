Party member Lu Keding from Wenchengkou Village, Zhongxiang County, Hubei Province, has been taking care of four elderly people who have no one to rely on since 1968. He also adopted a wandering youth and helped a family in extreme poverty to live a comfortable life. Recently, the Zhongxiang County Committee decided to award Lu Keding the title of "Model Communist Party Member" and called on all the people of the county to learn from his spirit of helping the poor, assisting the needy, and selfless dedication to communism.

In July 1968, Lu Keding's neighbor, Gao Guizhi, lost her husband. Gao, who was paralyzed and bedridden, was left alone and had no means of support. Lu Keding and his wife went to her bedside and said, "Mother, don't be sad. From now on, we will take care of you. As long as we have food to eat and clothes to wear, we will not let you go hungry or cold." In the following years, Lu Keding took care of three more elderly people: Chen Xiuying from Hu Dian Village, whose son had passed away; Xie Yuanfang from Yingzhong Town, who was abandoned by his children; and Zhang Xiuying from Kezhuang Township, who had been married four times, lost four husbands, and was considered an "unlucky star" by others. At the beginning of this year, he also adopted Li Guozhan, a young man who had been wandering outside Gaitian Town for many years. Lu Keding takes good care of them in every aspect of their lives.

Lu Keding, who is now 49 years old, was one of the poorest in the village before 1977, owing the collective more than 1,000 yuan. It was only after the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee that he gradually became prosperous. Now, his family's annual net income exceeds 20,000 yuan. Despite his wealth, Lu Keding has not forgotten his fellow villagers. He has lent 130,000 yuan to those in need and others who lacked money for production development. Lu Keding has been continuously evaluated as an agricultural labor model for six years.

    党员卢克定21年收养4位老人
    钟祥县委号召全县学习他的无私奉献精神
    新华社武汉7月21日电　湖北省钟祥县温峡口村农民、共产党员卢克定，从1968年到现在先后扶养4位生活无依的老人，还收养一个流浪青年，帮助一家特困户过上温饱生活。中共钟祥县委最近作出决定，授予卢克定“模范共产党员”称号，并号召全县人民学习他扶贫帮困、无私奉献的共产主义精神。
    1968年7月，卢克定的邻居高桂芝老人的丈夫不幸死去，偏瘫在床的高桂芝孤苦一人，生活无着。卢克定同妻子商量后来到老人床前说：“婆婆，您不要难过，从今以后，我们来侍候您。只要我们有饭吃，有衣穿，就不会让您挨饿受冷。”以后几年，卢克定又先后赡养了三位老人：胡畈村死去儿子的陈秀英，郢中镇被子女遗弃的谢元方，客店乡四次嫁人、死了四个丈夫、被人视为“灾星”的张秀英。今年年初，他又收养了柴湖镇一个在外流浪多年的青年李国战。卢克定在生活上对他们关怀备至。
    今年49岁的卢克定，1977年以前，是全村的首贫，欠集体款1000多元。十一届三中全会以后才逐步富裕起来，现在全家年纯收入超过2万元。卢克定富了不忘众乡邻。他先后拿出1.3万元借给困难户和其他缺钱户用于发展生产。卢克定连续6年被评为农业劳动模范。
