Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 5th.

China's chemical industry has maintained steady growth despite severe challenges. In the first half of the year, the total chemical output is expected to reach 35.03 billion yuan, a 4.8% increase over the same period last year. Except for Hubei Province, which saw a decline, all other provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the central government reported growth in their chemical output. Out of 16 major chemical products, 12, including sulfur ore, refined methanol, and tires, have completed more than 50% of their annual plans.

This year, the chemical industry has faced severe shortages of raw materials and energy, as well as extreme difficulties in transportation and funding. The chemical sector has employed every possible means to overcome these challenges. Especially during the turmoil and riots, the majority of workers have remained at their posts, maintaining production and contributing to the stability and unity of the situation.
