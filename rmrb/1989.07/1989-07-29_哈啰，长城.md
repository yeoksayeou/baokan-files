Every foreign tourist who travels thousands of miles to Beijing, upon ascending the Badaling section of the Great Wall, feeling the winds from all directions, and gazing at the majestic sight of the serpentine wall winding through the valleys and mountains, will undoubtedly greet it from the heart with a sincere "Hello, Great Wall!"

The first to express this greeting in both Chinese and English on the brown window of the Badaling sales department was the Jing-Ao Great Wall Souvenir Company, with Mr. Shini Bamente as its general manager.

On the morning of July 18th at 11 o'clock, this company, jointly operated by the Beijing Xibazhuang Township Agricultural and Industrial Joint Venture Company, Beijing Yuntong Advertising Agency, Badaling Forestry Farm, and the Australian Koala Investment Company, held a ribbon-cutting ceremony amidst the sound of firecrackers.

This is the first joint venture to appear at the foot of the ancient Great Wall, and it is also the first joint venture to open in Beijing since the end of April. Its registered capital is 300,000 US dollars, with a joint venture period of 15 years. The company's mission is to adhere to the principle of "one-stop service" for design, production, wholesale, retail, and export, providing permanent souvenirs for domestic and foreign tourists visiting the Great Wall, and continuously supplying the domestic and international tourist souvenir market with fresh products.

The Great Wall is one of the world's famous human wonders. Last year, more than 5 million tourists visited Badaling, including one overseas tourist for every seven visitors. People rejoice in the greatness of the Great Wall, but at the same time, they lament its monotony: the Badaling Special Zone cannot even buy a satisfactory souvenir!

Someone has done the statistics: last year, the average consumption of domestic tourists in Badaling was less than 10 yuan, and that of foreign tourists was less than 50 yuan. After deducting food expenses, the money actually spent on shopping is minimal, and most people return empty-handed.

This is not just the regret of the Great Wall. The Great Wall is a microcosm of the underdeveloped tourist souvenir market in Beijing and even in China.

Two years ago, when Shini first visited China, he discovered the potential of this market. Now, their company, starting with the "Great Wall Stone," has taken the first step in development. The Great Wall Stone is mined from the mountains of Badaling. For easy carrying, they specially select stones that are about the height of a finger, with various shapes. The base is polished flat and placed on a delicate ebony base. The imported Australian computer laser engraving equipment currently has software for Chinese, English, and Japanese, and plans to expand to German, Italian, French, Spanish, Arabic, and a total of 8 languages. According to the tourist's nationality, the date and name of the visit are engraved on a bright gold-colored copper plate, which is then adhered to the side of the wooden base with non-drying glue. It is then placed in an elegant Chinese-style black satin box, accompanied by a certificate of authenticity, proving that the stone is genuine and beyond doubt. The tourist can take it home as a testament to their visit to the Great Wall and show it to friends, and on the other hand, it will forever preserve a beautiful memory of China. The price is 25 yuan, suitable for both domestic and foreign tourists, and is particularly popular.

The company believes that tourist souvenirs must have unique local characteristics. "Distinctive design is economic benefit." They have a design team in Hong Kong at an international level, collecting the latest information from the global tourism market, and using the superb manual skills in China to process various trendy souvenirs with the Great Wall as the theme for the Badaling sales department, such as ceramic cups, keychains, postcards, small ornaments, balloons, headscarves, and multi-purpose umbrellas with the Badaling tourist map printed on them. At the same time, they also provide free design services for special souvenirs for domestic customers.

Mr. Shini believes that the Chinese market has great potential, and cooperation with China cannot be short-sighted. Although Beijing's tourism industry is currently facing setbacks, as long as China's preferential policies for joint ventures do not change, he has the confidence to continue operating the company. He hopes to see the living standards of the Chinese people continuously improve and rise.

Mr. Shini and his investment partner Taylor have great confidence in China's reform and opening-up policy. It was precisely because of this that during the Beijing turmoil, until the embassy mobilized, Shini left for Hong Kong on June 6th. As soon as the office conditions in Beijing were ready, he returned to Beijing on June 23rd. This caused quite a stir in Hong Kong. All major newspapers reported on the first brave Australian to return to Beijing. At the opening ceremony on the 18th, Shini's wife and daughter, who specially came from Australia, wore T-shirts designed by the company with the words "Hello, Great Wall," and stood happily beside Shini. It can be seen that they are full of hope for their business!

    哈啰，长城
    本报记者　刘霄
    相信每一位不远万里来到北京的外国游客，当他登临八达岭长城，迎八面来风，看脚下巨龙随幽谷大壑盘旋矫腾、蜿蜒远去的壮丽景象，会从心底里致一声衷心的问候：“哈啰，长城！”
    希尼·柏门特先生担任总经理的京澳长城纪念品有限公司，第一次把这声问候，用中英文两种异形字体，书写在他们八达岭门市部的茶色橱窗上。
    7月18日上午11时，这家由北京西拨子乡农工商联合企业总公司、北京运通广告社、八达岭林场与澳大利亚袋熊猫投资有限公司合资经营的企业，在鞭炮声中举行了剪彩仪式。
    这是古老长城脚下出现的第一个合资企业，也是自4月底以来北京首家开业的合资企业。其注册资本为30万美元，合资期限15年。公司的宗旨是：坚持设计、生产、批发、零售、出口“一条龙”，为游长城的中外游客提供永久性的纪念品，为国内外旅游纪念品市场不断提供有新鲜感的产品。
    万里长城是世界闻名的人类奇迹之一。去年前来八达岭的旅游者多达500余万，其中每7个人中就有1名海外游客。人们为长城的伟大而欢欣，同时又为长城的单调而感慨：八达岭特区竟然买不到一件称心如意的纪念品！
    有人作过统计，去年来八达岭的国内游客人均消费不足10元，国外游客人均消费不到50元。扣除餐饮开支，真正用于购物的钱微乎其微，绝大多数人都是空手而归。
    这不仅仅是长城的遗憾。长城，是北京乃至中国旅游纪念品市场不发达的缩影。
    两年前，希尼第一次访华的时候，就发现这个市场深具潜力。如今，他们的公司以“长城石”为开端，迈出了开拓性的一步。长城石采自八达岭的群山中，为便于携带，专门选择一指多高、千姿百态的山石，将底部磨平，置于精致的乌木座上。澳大利亚进口的电脑激光刻字设备，目前输入了中、英、日三种文字的软件，将来准备发展到德、意、法、西班牙、阿拉伯共8种文字。按游客的国别，将登城日期和姓名铭刻在亮金色的铜片上，用不干胶粘在木座一侧，然后装入典雅的中国式黑缎子锦盒中，内附一份鉴证书，证明此石货真价实，不容置疑。游客买去，可作为自己登长城的见证出示亲友，另一方面，睹物思情，又永远地保留了一份对中国的美好回忆。售价25元，中外咸宜，特受欢迎。
    公司认为，旅游纪念品必须具有不可替代的地方特色。“鲜明的特色设计就是经济效益”。他们在香港拥有一支国际水平的设计力量，收集世界旅游市场的最新信息，运用国内高超的手工工艺加工，为八达岭门市部提供各种以长城为主题的新潮纪念品，如瓷杯、钥匙扣、名信片、小饰物、汽球、头巾以及印有八达岭旅游图的多用伞等，同时还为国内客户提供特别纪念品的免费设计服务。
    希尼先生认为，中国市场有着巨大的潜力，跟中国合作不能短视。虽然目前北京旅游业暂时受挫，只要中国对合资企业的优惠政策不变，他就有信心把公司办下去。他希望看到中国人民的生活水平不断改进，不断提高。
    希尼先生和他的投资伙伴泰勒对中国改革开放政策深具信心。正是基于这一点，在北京动乱期间，直到使馆动员，希尼才于6月6日撤到香港。一俟北京办公条件具备，又于6月23日毅然返京。这在香港引起不小的震动。各大报都报道第一个回北京的勇敢的澳大利亚人。在18日的开业典礼上，专程从澳大利亚赶来的希尼夫人和女儿，穿着公司设计的“哈啰，长城”字样的恤衫，神情愉快地伴随在希尼身边。可以看出，他们对自己的事业充满着希望！
