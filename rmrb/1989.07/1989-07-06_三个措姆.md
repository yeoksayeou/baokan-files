Three Tsom Women

Reporter: Feng Yuan

White Ma Tsom, 57 years old, resides in Lebu with six children.

Tsom, 48 years old, is the deputy director of the Tibet Autonomous Region's Ethnic and Religious Affairs Commission.

Ren Zang Tsom, 26 years old, is an all-around assistant editor at the radio and television station in Shannan, Tibet.

These three women are the Tsoms that the reporter met during an interview with the Monba ethnic group in Tibet.

When we entered White Ma Tsom's three-story stone-walled, wooden-floored house, she was preparing lunch. The iron pot on the stove was already hot with oil, and beside it was a bottle of fragrant soy sauce. Her little grandson was eagerly grabbing some sliced radishes to taste. We took the opportunity to ask about her family's daily meals. She said, "In the morning, we eat tsampa; at noon, we have steamed rice and stir-fried vegetables in a pressure cooker; in the evening, we have buckwheat pancakes and butter tea. Some families also eat steamed buns. Originally, the traditional Monba cuisine is stone-pot buckwheat pancakes. Buckwheat and highland barley are the staple foods here. Now, except for the elderly, the young people all prefer refined grains! Coarse grains are usually fed to cows or used for brewing alcohol."

"Is there enough butter, grain, and money?" the reporter asked White Ma Tsom. She smiled, "We have 25 cows, 19 of which are female. We have more butter than we can eat, and we sell over 250 pounds every year! Now that the children are grown, they process some wood and weave bamboo products, earning over 2,000 yuan a year. Then we buy some grain, oil, and clothes." White Ma Tsom added, "Now the biggest shortage is chili peppers, which are hard to find and expensive. Also, the state-supplied woolen cloth has been discontinued for 5 years, so we have to use sheep wool to weave our own." The translator, Director Gesang Zhi of the Duo County Ethnic and Religious Affairs Bureau, explained: chili peppers are an essential seasoning for the Monba people, and woolen cloth is the main material for Monba clothing.

The reporter asked White Ma Tsom to introduce her children. She said, "The eldest son has started his own family, the second son is a veterinarian in the township, and the youngest son lives with me. Recently, he gave me a grandson. One daughter works as a doctor in another county, and the youngest daughter, 18 years old, is studying in the ethnic class at a middle school in Lhasa." Talking about her beloved children, she looked very content: "The children have grown up, and I am very happy. Now I have nothing missing, no difficulties."

Ren Zang Tsom's topic was quite different. The reporter chatted with her about her experiences. In 1976, at the age of 13, Ren Zang Tsom fortunately had the opportunity to study. Her mother, who had learned to read and write in night school, encouraged her daughter to leave home and pursue education. Since then, life has given Ren Zang Tsom many opportunities: she began her cultural education at the Border Minority Youth Training Class, then went to a normal school to further her studies, becoming proficient in both Chinese and Tibetan; in 1979, she was selected to work at the Nationalities Culture Palace in Beijing as a guide. During these two and a half years, she broadened her horizons, refined her character, and her stuttering Chinese became standard Mandarin; in 1982, she returned to Shannan and became a broadcaster at the radio and television station, while also studying part-time and eventually entering the Tibetan Nationalities Institute's adult extension class in the Chinese department, where she studied for two years; upon graduation, she joined the Menru Folk Literature Investigation Team, witnessing the rich cultural heritage of the Monba and Lhoba peoples in places like Metok, which was a kind of "root-seeking" journey for her; then, she returned to the radio and television station, and soon resumed her old job of reporting, editing, and broadcasting...

Before the age of 13, the simple customs of Lebu Township shaped Ren Zang Tsom's pure and natural character; after 13, in the ever-changing world, her intelligence and wit were developed, and she was endowed with thoughts, knowledge, and interests. Ren Zang Tsom realized her duty to her ethnic group and discovered that the Monba customs, folk songs, and Samar drinking songs she had taken for granted had such valuable cultural significance. She began to do her best to compile, translate, and publish... She knew that she was the only news worker among the Monba people and set higher standards for herself: insisting on writing a diary in Chinese, practicing writing essays, frequently interviewing, and discussing with her husband who loves news reporting and television news filming...

Seeing a stack of news business books on Ren Zang Tsom's desk, I jokingly asked her about her proud works and "ambitions." She calmly said, "I hope to become a genuine news worker." Her words were not surprising, but her bright eyes revealed more of her thoughts.

Before leaving Tibet, the reporter interviewed Tsom, the deputy director of the Autonomous Region's Ethnic and Religious Affairs Commission. She is a representative of the Monba ethnic group's leaders who grew up after liberation and is also an old news figure. Tsom has served as the head of Lebu District, deputy director of the Autonomous Region Women's Federation, and deputy commissioner of Shannan Prefecture. She always wanted to return to Lebu to do her best to change the old appearance of her hometown. However, work needs kept her in Lhasa for a long time.

To help us understand the situation in Metok County, where the Monba people live, Tsom specially invited Tsering Qunzong, Gesang Doma, and White Ma Quzhen (Lhoba ethnic group) from Metok. Metok is located in the high mountain gorge of the Yarlung Zangbo River's big bend and is the only county in the country without a road. Transportation restricts the economic and cultural development there. In addition, the people's demand for education and medical care is also high.

During the field interviews, we often heard that Tsom attaches great importance to rescuing cultural heritage. The Monba Opera was unearthed from the dust and performed at the Snow Festival in Lhasa, thanks to Tsom's initiative and help in solving practical difficulties. On this, Tsom said, "Seeing the monotonous cultural life of the people, with few movies, except for singing and dancing during the New Year and festivals, they usually just eat and drink. I thought of rescuing the Monba Opera, which can also make young people understand our culture and history. The Monba people have no written language, and the Monba Opera is passed down through oral tradition. Now some elderly people still know some of it, but the young people do not understand. We must hurry to rescue it and cannot let a nation's culture disappear like this."

A nation must cherish its traditional culture and also absorb the essence of modern civilization. Tsom pays special attention to education issues. Lhasa Middle School started an ethnic class in 1984 to cultivate young people from remote areas of Tibet. However, due to the lack of leadership, management, and teachers at one time, some students dropped out, and those in school were not settled. The destination of those who are about to graduate this year has not been solved. Tsom has been running around and is very worried. Because the ethnic regions need talents, for example, although Lebu has established a health station, due to the lack of medical and health personnel, the people still feel inconvenienced. Lebu's 8 Monba villages are scattered along the Namu River Valley for dozens of miles, but there is only one public primary school.

At the end, Tsom said, "People, without culture, will not cherish their own ethnic history. This truth I only understood after I came out and saw the world. Without education, there will be no ethnic progress and true ethnic equality."

    三个措姆
    本报记者　冯媛
    白玛措姆，57岁。家居勒布，6个儿女。
    措姆，48岁。西藏自治区民族宗教事务委员会副主任。
    仁增措姆，26岁。西藏山南地区广播电视台一位采、编、播全能的助理编辑。
    她们，就是记者在西藏采访门巴族时结识的3个措姆。
    我们走进白玛措姆那石头为墙、木板为地的3层住宅时，她正做中饭，火塘上的铁锅里，清油已经烧热，旁边有一瓶浓香的酱油，小孙子正急不可待地抓起一把待炒的萝卜片先尝为快。我们就势问起她家一日三餐的内容来。她说：“早上吃小麦面坨坨；中午是高压锅蒸大米饭、炒菜；晚上烙荞麦饼喝酥油茶。有的人家也吃馒头。本来，门巴族的传统风味是石锅烙荞麦饼，荞麦、青稞是这一带人的主食。现在除了老年人，年轻人都爱吃细粮啦！粗粮一般只喂牛或酿酒。”
    “酥油、粮食、钱够用吗？”记者问白玛措姆。她笑了：“家里有25头牛，母牛就19头，酥油吃不完，每年还卖250多斤呐！现在孩子长大了，加工些木材、编竹器，每年能换2000多元钱，再买些粮食、清油、衣服。”白玛措姆又说，“现在最缺的是辣椒，难买到还很贵。还有就是国家供应的氆氇，已经断销5年了，我们只好换羊毛自己织。”为我们翻译的错那县民族宗教局局长格桑普智解释道：辣椒是门巴族必不可少的调味品，氆氇则是门巴服装的主要用料。
    记者请白玛措姆介绍一下儿女们的情况。她说：“大儿子已分家，二儿子是乡里的兽医，小儿子和我一起住，最近给我添了个孙子。有个女儿在外县当医生，小女儿18岁，在拉萨中学民族班读书。”谈起她一个个可亲可爱的孩子，她显得很满足：“孩子们长大了，我很幸福，现在什么也不缺，什么困难也没有。”
    仁增措姆的话题则迥然不同了。记者和她聊起她的经历。1976年，13岁的仁增措姆幸运地有了个学习机会，在夜校里粗识文字的妈妈开明地让女儿远走高飞，从此，生活赐给了仁增措姆许多机会：在边疆少数民族青年训练班开始文化启蒙、进师范学校进一步学习，粗通汉藏两种文字；1979年，被选送到北京的民族文化宫担任讲解员。在这两年多的时间里，她开阔了视野、陶冶了性情，一口结结巴巴的汉话也变成了标准的普通话；1982年她回到山南，当广播电视台的播音员，同时业余坚持自学，终于考进西藏民族学院语文系成人专修班，深造了2年；毕业即参加门珞民间文学考察组，在门巴和珞巴聚居的墨脱等地耳闻目睹了丰富的民族文化遗产，这其实是她的一次“寻根”；然后，她又回到广播电视台，不久重操采访、编辑、播音的旧业……
    13岁前，勒布山乡的淳朴民风铸就了仁增措姆璞玉般的性格；13岁后，在飞旋的世界不断变换的位置，开发了她的才智和聪敏，赋予了她思想、知识和情趣。仁增措姆意识到了自己对民族的义务，她发现那些自己习以为常的门巴习俗、民间情歌、萨玛酒歌有那么值得珍视的文化价值。她开始尽其所能，整理、翻译、发表……她知道，自己是门巴族目前唯一的新闻工作者，对自己提出了更多的要求：坚持用汉文记日记、写散文练笔、勤采访和搞电视新闻摄像的爱人切磋互砺……
    看到仁增措姆的书桌上有一叠新闻业务书籍，我笑问她有什么得意之作和“野心”。她沉静地说：“我希望自己成为一个名副其实的新闻工作者。”话不惊人，但她明亮的眸子流露了更多的心声。
    离开西藏前夕，记者采访了自治区民族宗教事务委员会副主任措姆。她堪称解放后成长起来的门巴族领导干部的代表，也是一位老新闻人物。措姆曾任勒布区区长、自治区妇联副主任、山南行署副专员。她总想回到勒布，为改变家乡旧貌尽其所能。但是，工作需要却使她长居拉萨。
    为了让我们了解门巴族聚居的墨脱县的一些情况，措姆特地找来家在墨脱的次仁群宗、格桑卓玛和白玛曲珍（珞巴族）。墨脱，地处雅鲁藏布江大拐弯的高山峡谷中，是全国唯一不通公路的县。交通制约着那里的经济、文化的发展。此外，群众对教育和医疗的呼声也很高。
    在基层采访时，我们多次听说，措姆很重视抢救文化遗产。门巴戏从尘封土埋中被发掘、并在拉萨雪顿节汇演中为外界所知，多亏了措姆当初的倡议和帮助解决实际困难。对此，措姆说：“看到群众文化生活单调，电影少，除了过年过节唱唱跳跳外，平时就是吃一吃、喝一喝，我想到了抢救门巴戏，这还可以使年轻人了解我们的文化、我们的历史。门巴族没有文字，门巴戏是靠人们口头传唱流传下来的，现在有的老年人还知道一些，年轻人都不懂，我们必须赶紧抢救，不能让一个民族的文化就这样消失了。”
    一个民族要珍视自己的传统文化，也要吸收现代文明的精华，措姆特别关心教育问题。拉萨中学自1984年办起了民族班，培养西藏边远地区的少数民族青年。但由于领导、管理、教师等一度未落实好，有的班学生流失，在校的不安心，今年将要毕业的，去向问题尚未解决。措姆奔走呼号，十分忧虑。因为民族地区需要人才呵，比如勒布虽然建立了卫生所，但因缺乏医卫技术人才，群众还是颇感不便。勒布8个门巴族村子散居在沿娘姆江的几十里河谷，现在却只有一所公办小学。
    谈到最后，措姆说：“人，没有文化，就不会重视自己民族的历史。这个道理我是在出来见了世面之后才懂得的。没有教育，也不会有民族进步和真正的民族平等。”
