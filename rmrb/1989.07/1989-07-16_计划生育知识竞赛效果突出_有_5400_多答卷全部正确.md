The Ministry of Health launched a grand contest aimed at promoting the dissemination of knowledge on contraception, family planning, prenatal care, and child-rearing on the occasion of the "11 Billion Population Day" this year. The results were announced yesterday. Wang Fenglian, Director of the Maternal and Child Health Department of the Ministry of Health, happily reported: Over 5,400 answer sheets were completely correct, indicating that our family planning propaganda over the past few years has been effective.

It is understood that before the "Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases" comes into effect in September, the Ministry of Health will organize large-scale public knowledge contests on related topics.
