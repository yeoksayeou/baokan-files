The People's Daily reports: Correspondent Meng Xiaoyun reports that to make up for the losses caused by the turmoil, the Henan Foreign Economic and Trade Commission and its 30-plus import and export companies have taken effective measures to ensure the safe and timely shipment and settlement of export goods, earning a good reputation.

During the period when railway transportation was disrupted, a large number of export goods from the Henan Garment Import and Export Group Company were backlogged. To maintain the company's reputation, they used methods such as air freight at 50 times the cost of railway transportation and trucking at four to five times the cost of railway transportation to divert traffic and solve the problem of insufficient transport capacity. In May and June, they trucked 58 cars of goods, totaling 572 tons, valued at $3 million; and air-freighted 20 tons of goods, valued at approximately $210,000. The cargo volume in June increased by 31.6% compared to the same period last year, ensuring an average monthly export of $8 million in foreign exchange and the timely shipment of $10 million worth of goods, making foreign customers satisfied. The Henan Light Industry Import and Export Group Company, in the face of railway transportation difficulties, mobilized 60 trucks to transport export goods to Shenzhen on time, fulfilling the contract promptly.

    河南重视外贸工作信誉  安全及时发运出口物资
    本报讯　记者孟晓云报道：为夺回动乱造成的损失，河南对外经贸委下属30多家进出口公司采取有效措施，确保出口货物的安全及时发运和结汇，取得良好信誉。
    在铁路运输一度受阻期间，河南服装进出口集团公司的大批出口货物积压，为了保住公司的信誉，他们用高于铁路运输50倍的价格空运和高于铁路运输四五倍的价格汽运等办法分流，解决运力不足的问题。5至6月，他们先后汽运商品58车，计572吨，价值300万美元；空运商品20吨，价值约21万美元，6月份货运量比去年同期增长31.6％，保证了月均800万美元的出口创汇和1000万美元货物的及时出运，使国外客户心服口服。河南轻工业进出口集团公司，在铁路运输困难的情况下，开动60部汽车将出口货物及时运到深圳，按时履约。
