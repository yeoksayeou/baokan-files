The 81st anniversary of the founding of the army is approaching. The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army issued a notice on July 4, requiring the entire army to extensively carry out support-the-government and love-the-people activities during the 81st anniversary period, further strengthening military-political and military-civilian unity.

The notice from the General Political Department stated that this year's 81st anniversary is the 62nd anniversary of the founding of our army. After the decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing and stopping the turmoil in various places, and the successful convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, it is of special importance to enthusiastically celebrate this glorious festival. This celebration should be closely linked with the study and implementation of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, emphasizing the theme of "the people's army loves the people." It should inspire officers and soldiers to remember the purpose of our army, inherit and carry forward the glorious traditions of our party and our army, further strengthen military-political and military-civilian relations, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and strive for a complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stopping the turmoil, and for the completion of various tasks assigned by the Party and the people to our army.

The notice requires the following aspects of work:

	1. Conduct a comprehensive education on support-the-government and love-the-people. During the process of studying and implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, it is necessary to combine the education on the purpose, nature, tasks of our army, and the glorious tradition of support-the-government and love-the-people. Organize officers and soldiers to learn from the high political awareness demonstrated by the capital's martial law troops in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, their spirit of being loyal to the Party, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the people, their revolutionary spirit of not fearing hardships and sacrifices, and their strict organizational discipline of resolutely executing orders and everything under command. It is necessary to publicize the deeds of the people loving the children of the army and carry out activities to learn from the masses. It is also possible to hold model deeds reporting meetings with the main content of stopping the turmoil, suppressing the rebellion, or support-the-government and love-the-people.

	2. Actively do good deeds and practical things for the people. Each unit should start from reality, combine with the joint construction of socialist spiritual civilization by the military and the people, and do good deeds for the local people to the best of their ability. If conditions permit, they can concentrate their efforts to do one or two things that the local people urgently need and have an impact.

	3. Conduct visits, condolences, and inspections of discipline among the people. During the festival, each unit should, through sending people to visit local areas or holding symposiums, humbly listen to the opinions of local governments and the people, inspect the implementation of discipline among the people, and promptly handle any problems. They should warmly receive condolences from local areas and politely decline any donations of money or goods from local units and the people.

	4. Do a good job in commending advanced examples of support-the-government and love-the-people. During the 81st anniversary, the General Political Department will commend a batch of advanced units and individuals in support-the-government and love-the-people. Each unit should also commend and publicize some good examples.

	5. Organize festival cultural activities well. Activities should be organized with the content of singing the praises of the Party, the People's Republic, the people's army, and the military-civilian relationship. Group singing and reading activities can be organized, as well as art performances, sports competitions, or military-civilian celebrations. The entire army will hold a "81st Anniversary Film Week," screening a batch of excellent military-themed films. Each unit should organize the screening and viewing.

	6. Warmly visit and condole military retirees and organize them to participate in festival celebrations.

The notice requires each unit to carry out celebration activities based on reality, pay attention to thrift, mainly organize small-scale activities, and avoid formalism. The activities should be both colorful and lively, as well as solid and effective.
