The U.S. State Department spokesman, Richard Boucher, confirmed today that Czechoslovakia has expelled a U.S. diplomat.

Earlier today, the Associated Press quoted a U.S. government official as saying that Robert Norman, a political officer at the U.S. embassy in Czechoslovakia, had excessive contact with anti-government elements and engaged in activities inconsistent with his diplomatic status. Therefore, the Czechoslovakian government has ordered this diplomat to leave the country.

    捷驱逐美一外交官
    新华社华盛顿6月30日电　美国国务院发言人塔特怀勒今天证实，捷克斯洛伐克驱逐了一名美国外交官。
    美联社今天早些时候援引一位美国政府官员的话说，美国驻捷使馆负责政治事务的外交官罗伯特·诺尔曼与捷反政府分子交往过密，并进行了与其外交官身份不符的活动。因此，捷政府已下令这位外交官离境。
