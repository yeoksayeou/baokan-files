	Racing Against the Flood Peak
	To ensure the safety of over 100 households in Xiaofenghuang Village, Hanyang District, Wuhan, the district's flood control command center mobilized vehicles from 40 units within the district to transport stones and soil. They implemented mechanical construction to guarantee the completion of a 50-meter-long transverse dike before the arrival of the third flood peak.	Photo by Deng Xianling
