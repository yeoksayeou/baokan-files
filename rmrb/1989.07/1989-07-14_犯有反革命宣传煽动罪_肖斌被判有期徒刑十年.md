The Dalian Intermediate People's Court sentenced counter-revolutionary propagandist and inciter Xiao Bin to ten years' imprisonment and three years' deprivation of political rights on July 13.

Xiao Bin, 42, was formerly a worker at the Dalian Star Sea Aluminum Window Factory. According to the court, he was extremely dissatisfied with the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing and engaged in extensive counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement activities. On June 5, Xiao Bin went to a street intersection in Beijing and falsely propagated and incited to 3 American Broadcasting Company (ABC) reporters and dozens of onlookers, saying, "I saw the troops run over people, kill too many people," "using tanks and armored vehicles to run over," "people were crushed into mincemeat," "they also used guns and batons, beating until unconscious and then shooting, those who didn't die got another shot," and some "used bayonets to stab." He also stretched out two fingers and falsely claimed, "Now more than twenty thousand have died," "it was too brutal, never seen anything like it." He further incited, "Now many people are thinking of ways, as long as they (referring to the martial law troops) come out one by one, it's a one-on-one fight, kill him."

Xiao's reactionary propaganda activities were recorded by ABC reporters and sent to New York, providing "evidence" for domestic and foreign reactionary forces to viciously attack the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China, causing extremely bad political influence both domestically and internationally.

According to the court, Xiao Bin also spread rumors and incited on multiple occasions from June 8 to 10, at Beijing Railway Station platform, on the 229th train from Beijing to Dalian, and at the Dalian Seventh Plastic Factory, saying: "More than twenty thousand people died in Tiananmen Square, the blood was this thick (one centimeter)," "the military mowed down people with guns, pushed them together with bulldozers, and burned them all with incendiary bombs." He also spread rumors saying: "They even did not spare pregnant women, a woman shouted she was a pregnant woman and not to shoot, but the soldier shot her down."

After returning to Dalian, Xiao Bin also incited the masses to oppose the Communist Party and the people's government. He falsely claimed that Beijing workers "had more than a thousand people jointly requesting to withdraw from the party," that the radio and television "propaganda were all false," and cursed, "Dalian people are cowards, all became slaves."

In court, Xiao Bin admitted that the rumors he spread "were not facts."

After reviewing the case, the Dalian Intermediate People's Court ruled that Xiao Bin publicly fabricated and spread various shocking counter-revolutionary rumors, maliciously defaming and slandering the just actions of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, inciting and provoking the uninformed masses to resist and defy the State Council's decree to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. His intentions were malicious, and his behavior was arrogant. According to Article 102 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, his actions constituted the crime of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.

    犯有反革命宣传煽动罪
    肖斌被判有期徒刑十年
    新华社大连7月14日电  （记者赵昌春）大连市中级人民法院13日依法判处反革命宣传煽动犯肖斌有期徒刑10年，剥夺政治权利3年。
    肖斌今年42岁，原系大连星海铝窗厂工人。据法院介绍，他对平息北京反革命暴乱极为不满，大肆进行反革命宣传煽动活动。今年6月5日，肖斌窜至北京一路口处，向3名美国广播公司（ABC）记者及数十名在场群众无中生有地宣传煽动说，“我看见部队轧死人、打死人太多了”，“用坦克车、装甲车轧”，“把人轧成肉酱”，“还用枪打、用警棍打，打昏了再打一枪，没有死的补一枪”，还有的“拿刺刀挑一下”。他并伸出两个手指胡说什么“现在死了两万多”，“太凶残了，没有见过”。他还煽动说，“现在好多人在想办法，只要他们（指戒严部队官兵）出来一个，是单挑，就杀死他”。肖犯的这些反动宣传活动被美国广播公司记者录像后，发往美国纽约，为国内外反动势力恶毒攻击中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府提供了“依据”，在国内外造成极坏的政治影响。
    据法院介绍，肖斌还先后于今年6月8日至10日，分别在北京火车站站台、北京开往大连的229次列车上和大连第七塑料厂等处，多次向群众造谣煽动说：“天安门广场死了两万多人，血有这么厚（一厘米）”，“军队把人用枪扫倒了，用推土机推到一起，用燃烧弹全部给烧了”。他还造谣说：“他们甚至连孕妇也不放过，有个妇女喊我是怀孕的妇女不要开枪，但军人开枪把她打倒了。”
    肖斌回到大连后，还煽动群众起来反对共产党和人民政府。他胡说北京工人“有一千多人联名要求退党”，电台、电视台的“宣传都是假的”，并咒骂“大连人是熊包、脓包”，“都成了奴隶”。
    肖斌在法庭上承认他所散布的谣言“不是事实”。
    大连市中级人民法院经过审理认定，肖斌公开制造并散布种种耸人听闻的反革命谣言，大肆诬蔑和诋毁中国人民解放军戒严部队平息反革命暴乱的正义行动，煽动、挑拨不明真相的群众抵制和抗拒国务院关于平息反革命暴乱的法令，用心险恶，气焰嚣张，根据我国《刑法》第102条规定，已构成反革命宣传煽动罪。
