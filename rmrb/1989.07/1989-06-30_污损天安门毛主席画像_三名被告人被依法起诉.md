Defacement of Mao's Portrait at Tiananmen Gate: Three Defendants Indicted

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 30 — The case involving the defacement of Mao Zedong's portrait at Tiananmen Gate on May 23 has been prosecuted by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate Branch to the Beijing Intermediate People's Court today.

The three defendants are: Yu Zhijian (also known as Yu Mingfei), a teacher at Tan Tou Primary School in Luoyang County, Hunan Province; Yu Dongyue, an art editor at the Luoyang Daily in Hunan Province; and Lu Decheng, a worker at the Luoyang Branch of the Hunan Provincial Automobile Transport Company.

On May 19, Yu Zhijian and the other two defendants conspired to travel from Changsha to Beijing. While participating in illegal demonstrations, they planned to deface the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong hanging on Tiananmen Gate. They purchased ink, oil paints, advertising dyes, paper, and brushes from Wangfujing, and found some eggshells to mix the dyes, which they then placed into the shells.

At around 2:00 PM on May 23, the three defendants first pasted reactionary slogans such as "The end of 5,000 years of autocracy" on both sides of the main gate of Tiananmen. They then threw the eggshells filled with dyes and ink at the portrait of Chairman Mao, severely damaging the portrait and Tiananmen Gate. They were caught on the spot.

The Beijing Municipal Procuratorate Branch believes that the actions of Yu Zhijian, Yu Dongyue, and Lu Decheng constitute the crimes of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, and counter-revolutionary sabotage.

    余志坚等3人5月19日合谋自长沙到达北京后，一面参加非法游行示威，一面预谋污损天安门城楼上悬挂的毛泽东主席画像。他们先后到王府井买了墨汁、油彩、广告颜料、纸张、毛笔等，又找来一些鸡蛋壳，将颜料混合后装入蛋壳。
  5月23日下午2时许，他们3人先在天安门主城门洞两侧张贴了“五千年专制到此可告一段落”等反动标语，后又将装有颜料的鸡蛋壳及墨汁投向毛主席画像，致使画像和天安门城楼遭到严重污损，被当场抓获。
    北京市检察院分院认为，余志坚、喻东岳、鲁德成的行为已构成反革命宣传煽动罪和反革命破坏罪。
