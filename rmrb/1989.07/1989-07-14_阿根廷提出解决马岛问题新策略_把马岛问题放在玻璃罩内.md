Argentina Proposes New Strategy to Resolve the Falklands Issue
Placing the Falklands Issue Under a Glass Dome

Our reporter Li Zhiming reports from Buenos Aires, July 13: Argentine President Menem stated yesterday that the Argentine government is willing to formally declare a cessation of hostilities, provided that the British side simultaneously cancels the unilateral exclusion zone it has set up around the Malvinas Islands. The presidential spokesman said that the Argentine government has decided to adopt a new strategy regarding the Falklands issue.

Newly inaugurated Argentine President Menem reiterated during his inauguration that reclaiming the Falklands is a cause that the Argentine people will not abandon, while also expressing a willingness to restore diplomatic relations with Britain. Regarding the sovereignty issue that hinders direct negotiations between the two countries, Menem proposed that it could be placed under an umbrella or enclosed in a glass dome, meaning it would not be set aside but temporarily not touched while still visible. This new proposal has sparked widespread interest in the diplomatic circles here. It is believed that this is a stance taken by the Menem government, which advocates for a pragmatic approach in both domestic and foreign policies.

    阿根廷提出解决马岛问题新策略
    把马岛问题放在玻璃罩内
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯7月13日电　记者李志明报道：阿根廷总统梅内姆昨天表示，阿根廷政府愿意正式宣布中止敌对状态，如果英国方面同时取消马尔维纳斯群岛周围单方面设置的禁区的话。总统府发言人称，在马岛问题上阿根廷政府决定采取新策略。
    阿根廷新总统梅内姆在就职时重申了收复马岛是阿根廷人民不会放弃的事业，同时表示愿意同英国恢复外交关系。关于阻碍两国直接谈判的主权问题，梅内姆提出可以把它置于伞下或用玻璃罩罩住，意即不是搁置一边而是暂不触及但可以看到。这个新提法引起这里外交界广泛兴趣。人们认为，这是主张在内政外交上都取实用主义立场的梅内姆政府的一个姿态。
