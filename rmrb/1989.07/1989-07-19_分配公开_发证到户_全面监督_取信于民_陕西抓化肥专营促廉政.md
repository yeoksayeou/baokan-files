The couplet "I won't buy high-priced fertilizer, I won't sell grain at the market price; don't blame the government" is no longer seen in Shaanxi Province. This province sold 83.4 million tons of fertilizer to farmers in the first half of this year, which is roughly the same as the same period last year. Due to the fair and reasonable supply of the monopoly, the vast majority of farmers are satisfied.

The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government believe that the issue of fertilizer supply is not just a simple economic problem, but a political problem that affects the trust of 80% of the province's population, who are farmers, in the Party and the government. Therefore, they decided to use the fertilizer monopoly supply as a breakthrough point, concentrate their efforts to strengthen the construction of clean governance institutions, summarize and accumulate experience, and then promote the treatment of one front after another, expanding the effect of combating corruption.

To meet the basic requirements of "public distribution, certificates issued to households, comprehensive supervision, and serious handling," the provincial government published in April the allocation indicators for various types of fertilizers to various cities and counties and directly supplied counties, allocation policies, supply methods, supply prices, etc., in the *Shaanxi Daily*. Various cities and counties also publicized through local newspapers, radio, notices, etc., layer by layer. According to the recent inspection situation, the 8 types of agricultural and sideline products coupled with fertilizers and special fertilizers stipulated by the province have all been issued to households with certificates and supplied with tickets; for poverty alleviation and disaster relief fertilizers, they are directly allocated to households, and the allocation plan and results are posted.

In terms of comprehensive supervision, Shaanxi Province, in addition to having dedicated personnel for spot checks, has also established fertilizer reporting agencies at various levels of supply and marketing departments, published reporting telephone numbers, and formed a supervision system from top to bottom.

According to preliminary statistics, in the first half of this year, the province investigated and dealt with 70 cases of fertilizer-related violations, and gave necessary party discipline, administrative discipline, and criminal penalties to 12 county-level party members and cadres, 32 general cadres and staff, and 23 village cadres involved. 22.4 tons of illegal fertilizers were confiscated, and fines totaling 165,000 yuan were imposed, effectively curbing the improper practices in fertilizer supply.

### 分配公开　发证到户　全面监督　取信于民  陕西抓化肥专营促廉政

    分配公开　发证到户　全面监督　取信于民
    陕西抓化肥专营促廉政
    本报西安7月19日电　记者景险峰报道：“高价化肥我不买，平价粮食我不卖；政府莫怪”的对联，如今在陕西省看不到了。这个省今年上半年共向农民销售化肥83.4万吨，与去年同期基本持平，由于专营供应做到公平合理，绝大多数农民表示满意。
    陕西省委、省政府认为，化肥供应问题不单纯是一个简单的经济问题，而是一个关系到占全省人口80％的农民群众对党和政府的信任的政治问题。因此，他们决定将化肥专营供应这条线作为突破口，集中力量加强廉政制度建设，总结积累经验，然后一条战线一条战线推广治理，扩大惩治腐败的效果。
    为了做到“分配公开，发证到户，全面监督，严肃处理”的基本要求，省政府于4月份将上半年分配给各地市和各直供县的各类化肥指标、分配政策、供应办法、供应价格等，在《陕西日报》上公布于众；各地市和县区，也通过当地的报纸、广播、通知等，层层实行公开。根据最近的检查情况，省上规定的8种农副产品挂钩化肥和专项化肥，全部做到了发证到户，凭票供应；对扶贫、救灾化肥，也直接分配到户，并将分配方案和结果张榜公布。
    在实施全面监督方面，陕西省除了专人抽查，还在各级供销部门分别建立了化肥举报机构，公布了举报电话，自上而下地形成了监督体系。
    据初步统计，今年上半年全省共立案查处化肥违纪案件70起，对涉及的12名科级党员干部，32名一般干部、职工和23名村干部，分别给予了必要的党纪、政纪、刑事处分，没收违纪化肥22.4吨，罚款16.5万余元，有效地刹住了化肥供应中的不正之风。
