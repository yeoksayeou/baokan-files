    Seventeen chemical industry enterprises and institutions under the jurisdiction of the Jilin Municipal Government in Jilin Province recently held a signing ceremony with the Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation to implement asset management integration. With this, Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation, through methods such as paid transfers, free mergers, and asset management integration, has formed a large-scale chemical industry enterprise group, taking a new step in deepening economic system reforms and playing a leading role in large enterprises.

    Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation is one of the top ten enterprises in the country, with strong capabilities. In September 1987, Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation implemented a joint contract management for 13 small and medium-sized chemical enterprises in Jilin City, resulting in significant economic benefits. In 1988, compared to 1986 before the contract, the output value of these 13 enterprises increased by 35.22%, and the realized profit increased by 174.7%.

    This year, Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation further leveraged its advantages to implement cross-regional and cross-industry mergers. In May, it reached an agreement with the Liaoyuan Municipal Government to transfer all assets of 12 medical and chemical enterprises in the city for 75 million yuan, to be paid in installments by 1992. At the same time, Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation also implemented a free merger of the Jilin Heavy Machinery Plant, which has over 3,000 employees and accumulated losses of 20.67 million yuan.

    This tightly integrated enterprise group is beneficial for adjusting the product structure, further playing the role of large enterprises in economic development, implementing "big enterprises leading small ones, strong enterprises supporting weak ones," and achieving complementary advantages and common development. At the same time, since it is no longer restricted by the affiliation relationship, large enterprises also dare to invest more in technical transformation, expansion of production, and development of new products for medium and small enterprises. After Jilin Chemical Industry Corporation merged with the nearly shut-down Jilin Heavy Machinery Plant, it allocated 7.5 million yuan within a month for production resumption and technical transformation, achieving a short-term operation rate of 60%.

    形成跨地区跨行业大型企业集团
    吉化在兼并中壮大
    以强带弱  优势互补  共同发展
    本报长春电　记者李安达报道：吉林省吉林市政府所属的17家化工企事业单位，最近与吉林化学工业公司就实行资产经营一体化举行了签字仪式。至此，吉化以有偿转让、无偿兼并、资产经营一体化等方式，组建成一个大型化工企业集团，在深化经济体制改革、发挥大企业骨干作用方面迈出了新步伐。
    吉化是全国十大企业之一，实力雄厚。1987年9月，吉化对吉林市所属的13户中小型化工企业实行了联合承包，结果经济效益十分显著。1988年与承包前的1986年相比，这13户企业产值增长35.22％，实现利润增长174.7％。
    今年，吉化公司进一步发挥优势，实行跨地区、跨行业的兼并。5月，与辽源市政府达成协议，将该市所属12户医药化工企业全部资产以7500万元的价格转让过来，到1992年分期付清给辽源市。同时，吉化又对有3000多名职工、累计亏损达2067万元的吉林重型机器厂实行了无偿兼并。
    这种紧密型联合的企业集团，有利于调整产品结构，有利于进一步发挥大企业在经济发展中的作用，实行以大带小，以强带弱，优势互补，共同发展；同时，由于不再受隶属关系限制，大企业也敢于放开手脚对中小企业在技术改造、扩大再生产、开发新产品方面进行再投入。吉化兼并了近乎停产的吉林重型机器厂以后，在一个月内拨款750万元用于恢复生产和技术改造，短期内开工率达到60％。
