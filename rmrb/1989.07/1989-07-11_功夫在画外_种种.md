Title: Various Aspects of "The Effort Lies Outside the Painting"

The literary world has a famous saying, "The effort lies outside the poem," and the art world also has a saying, "The effort lies outside the painting." The original meaning is that an artist, in addition to diligently honing their painting skills, must also pay attention to improving their thoughts, morals, and character. Generally, artists of great achievement, both past and present, have strived to do this "effort outside the painting."

However, in recent years, some people in the art world have understood "the effort lies outside the painting" in a different way. They have interpreted the meaning of "effort outside the painting" in a twisted and deviant manner. In their view, an artist only needs to be good at reading the trends, seizing opportunities, mastering relationship-building, and "seeking from both above and below" and scheming, in order to achieve fame and fortune in the arts. According to my observations, in contemporary Chinese art circles, there are several types of people whose personal integrity and artistic works have very distinct characteristics. These characteristics can be summarized as follows:

The first type: They have talent, high moral character, and upright conduct. In their artistic creation, they take a serious attitude and continuously produce excellent works. However, because they lack or are unwilling to do the so-called "effort outside the painting" of today, they find it difficult to become famous and even more difficult to become very famous. Sometimes, they can only become famous after their death. For example, in recent years, the Chinese painters Huang Qiuyuan and Chen Zizhuang, who have been discussed the most, only became famous after their deaths. The former did not even have the qualification to be a member of the Jiangxi Artists Association, and the latter was so poor that he could only buy three-cent paper to paint on.

The second type: They have average talent, but they are good at doing "effort outside the painting," good at "public relations," and good at seizing opportunities that benefit themselves. Although they have nothing impressive in the arts, they can still become famous. However, in reality, their fame is often not what it seems. Because this "fame" is a hollow fame, a worthless "name."

The third type: They have both talent and are good at doing the so-called "effort outside the painting" of today. They are quite knowledgeable about "relationship-building" and, for the sake of seeking fame and fortune, are willing to use all means. Such artists are not uncommon in the history of both China and the West. For example, in recent years, some domestic art magazines have deified and promoted the so-called "world art master" Picasso. He has two sides: he is very talented, but he is also very good at doing "effort outside the painting." In the book "My Life with Picasso" published by Hong Kong Tianfeng Publishing House and written by Picasso's wife Françoise Gilot, a large number of facts are revealed about Picasso's "secret" to success, proving how Picasso, in order to make himself famous, schemed and schemed to do a lot of "effort outside the painting." Unfortunately, some domestic art magazines that enthusiastically promote Picasso's god-like status do not mention a word about Picasso's side.

In fact, Picasso's "foreign secret" has long lost its value in the Chinese art world, and there are signs that those who are proficient in the "secret" of "effort outside the painting" have already surpassed Picasso, making the late Picasso master sigh in his grave.

Thus, in the contemporary Chinese art world, there is a situation similar to that in the economic sector, where fake and counterfeit goods flood the market. "Painters," "sculptors," and "decorative artists" whose names do not match their abilities are everywhere; fake paintings and low-quality paintings are hyped up as "great artistic masterpieces" to deceive people. This bad trend has created a poor atmosphere in the art world, leading to a large number of mediocre, low-quality works, and making it difficult for truly valuable works to emerge. Therefore, I believe that in the art world, there is a serious issue of eliminating bad trends and promoting positive energy. If this issue is not quickly resolved, China's art industry will not be able to truly develop.

### “功夫在画外”种种

    “功夫在画外”种种
    钱海源
    文学界有句名言“功夫在诗外”，美术界也流行一句“行话”，叫做“功夫在画外”。其本意是，一个画家，除了必须刻苦锤炼绘画技艺外，还必须注意提高思想、道德和情操的修养。大凡中外古今卓有成就的艺术家，都努力这样去做“画外的功夫”。
    但是，近几年来，美术界一些人所理解的“功夫在画外”，似乎并不是笔者在上面所说的这些“画外功夫”。他们把“画外功夫”的含义理解到邪门歪道上去了。在他们看来，一个画家只要善于看风向行情，善于抓住机遇，善于搞关系学，善于“上下求索”和钻营，就能在艺术上求得功名利禄。据笔者观察，在当代中国美术界，有几种人的人品和画品，都有着非常鲜明的不同特点，这些特点可以归纳为如下几种：
    第一种：他们有才能，人品高尚，作风正派，在艺术创作方面态度严肃，不断有佳作问世。但由于其缺乏或者不愿做时下所说的那种
  “画外功夫”，因此，他们很难出名，更难于出大名。甚至要等他们死后才能出大名。如近几年来大家谈论最多的，死后才名扬中外的中国画家黄秋园和陈子庄先生便是。前者死前连江西美术家协会分会会员资格都无权取得，后者竟穷困潦倒到只能买三分钱一张的毛边纸作画。
    第二种：他们才能平平，但由于他们善于做“画外功夫”，善于搞“公关”，善于抓住有利于自己的机遇。尽管在艺术上没有什么像样的东西，但却能出名。可是，在实际上他们的功名往往是名不符实。因为，这种“名”是一种虚名，无价值的“名”。
    第三种：他们既有才能，又善于做时下所说的那种“画外功夫”，对“关系学”颇有研究，为了追名逐利，不惜采用一切手段。这种艺术家，中外的历史上也不乏其例。如近年来被国内某些美术报刊神化宣传的，号称为“世界艺术大师”的毕加索，就具有两面性。他很有才华，但也很善于搞“画外功夫”。香港天风出版社出版的、由毕加索妻子法兰雪丝·姬罗写的《我与毕加索》一书中，以大量的事实披露毕加索功成名就的“秘诀”，证明毕加索怎样为了使自己出名，挖空心思进行投机钻营，做大量的“画外功夫”。令人遗憾的是，国内某些起劲对毕加索进行造神宣传的美术报刊，对于毕加索这方面的事却只字不提。
    事实上，毕加索这一套洋“秘诀”，在中国美术界不仅早已没有保密的价值，而且，有迹象表明精于“画外功夫”“秘诀”者，早已超过了毕加索，使九泉之下的毕加索大师要自叹弗如。
    于是，在当代中国画坛，也出现了如经济领域中的那种假货、假冒商品充斥市场的混乱情况，名不符实的“画家”、“雕塑家”和“装修艺术家”几乎到处都有；假画，质量低劣的画被吹捧为“伟大的艺术杰作”骗人事例时有发生。这种歪风，造成了画坛的不良风气，造成了平庸的、质量低劣的作品大量涌现，真正具有艺术价值的优秀作品却难于产生的困境。所以，笔者认为，在美术界，也存在有一个煞歪风、扶正气的严肃问题。如果这个问题不迅速予以解决，我国的美术事业就不可能真正得到发展。
