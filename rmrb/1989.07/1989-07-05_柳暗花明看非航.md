For a period of time, people often used phrases like "beyond cure" and "shaky" to describe African Airlines. To revitalize African Airlines, the heads of its member countries have almost always gathered once a year to seek remedies for the root causes and have taken many positive measures. However, the trend of worsening conditions for African Airlines has not been stopped.

Early this year, at the invitation of Ivorian President Houphouët-Boigny, the heads of state and representatives of 10 African countries met again in Yamoussoukro, the capital of Côte d'Ivoire, to reach a consensus on how to rectify African Airlines and approved a plan known as the "Salvation Plan" or the "Roland Plan."

African Airlines (see the above picture) is the largest airline in Africa, established on March 28, 1961. It was founded based on the Yaoundé Agreement signed by countries such as Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Central African Republic, Benin, Gabon, Burkina Faso, Mauritania, Niger, Senegal, Chad, and Cameroon. The total investment was 140 billion West African CFA francs, with its headquarters in Abidjan. In 1973 and 1977, Cameroon and Gabon withdrew from African Airlines due to the establishment of their own airlines. Later, Togo joined. Currently, African Airlines has 10 member countries, 5,626 employees, 11 large passenger planes, and connects more than 40 countries and regions across four continents, with a total route length of 160,000 kilometers.

Over the past 28 years, African Airlines has played an important role in promoting the development of tourism, aviation, hotel, and communication industries in African countries, facilitating communication between African countries and between Africa and the world, and accelerating the economic development and social progress of the entire continent. At its inception, it had an annual passenger volume of only 280,000, which increased to 500,000 in 1978 and reached 1 million last year. Its cargo volume has also increased by more than three times compared to the past.

In recent years, the main difficulties faced by African Airlines are: first, some member countries have delayed paying their dues, causing African Airlines to face financial difficulties and a high debt burden. By the end of 1987, its financial deficit had reached 14.7 billion West African CFA francs; second, there is a serious problem of excessive staffing and idle personnel; third, financial discipline is lax, with free tickets being issued indiscriminately, and it is common for officials from member countries to travel for free. Due to the above reasons, the economic benefits of African Airlines have been getting worse. The operating situation of African Airlines has caused serious concern and unease among the member countries.

In March 1987, at the Niamey meeting attended by the heads of state of its member countries, the representatives present entrusted the mission of revitalizing African Airlines to Ivorian President Houphouët-Boigny. In August 1988, the heads of state met again in Cotonou, the capital of Benin, and reaffirmed this entrustment. At this meeting, President Houphouët-Boigny reported his ideas to the leaders of various countries. His idea was that African Airlines should remove all political colors, become a purely commercial entity, and be operated and managed using economic means. For this purpose, an expert from outside the member countries must be hired as the general manager. At the end of December last year, as soon as the Casablanca Franco-African summit ended, Houphouët-Boigny went to France, requesting France's help in rectifying and revitalizing African Airlines, and inviting the President of the French Economic Cooperation Central Bank, Roland, to take up the position of general manager. Roland accepted the invitation and, after conducting a survey and research on the airline, proposed this 50-page "Roland Plan."

The main contents of this plan are: first, to reduce redundant staff, starting from now until the end of this year, 2,000 employees will be laid off, regardless of which country they come from or whether they have "backing," and those laid off will be compensated by African Airlines to help them find other jobs; to abolish the original method of dispatching a fixed number of personnel from each member country to work for African Airlines, and instead, to publicly recruit based on needs; in addition, the salary policy will be reformed to better motivate the enthusiasm of employees; to establish a more stringent financial accounting system to eliminate all wasteful behaviors; to update the information system, etc.

At the recent Yamoussoukro meeting, the heads of state and representatives unanimously approved the "Roland Plan." This once again demonstrated the spirit of unity and cooperation among the member countries. Local commentators believe that this is a "powerful" plan, a "major surgery" for African Airlines. Of course, in the process of implementing this plan, various difficulties will be encountered, and perhaps a price will have to be paid, but "to gain something, one must lose something." People have reason to expect that African Airlines will take this as a turning point and gradually regain its vitality.

    柳暗花明看非航
    本报记者　杨汝生
    一个时期以来，人们常用“病入膏肓”和“风雨飘摇”等字眼来形容非洲航空公司。为了重振非航，它的成员国首脑几乎每年都要聚会一次，寻求医治病根的药方，并采取了许多积极措施，但非航情况日益恶化的趋势并未遏止。
    今年初，应科特迪瓦总统博瓦尼之邀，非洲10国首脑和代表再次在科特迪瓦首都亚穆苏克罗会晤，就如何整顿非航取得一致意见，并批准了一个被称之为“拯救计划”的“罗朗计划”。
    非洲航空公司（见上图）是非洲最大的航空公司，创建于1961年3月28日。它是根据刚果、科特迪瓦、中非、贝宁、加蓬、布基纳法索、毛里塔尼亚、尼日尔、塞内加尔、乍得和喀麦隆等国签署的雅温得协议而建立的。投资总额为1400亿西非法郎，总部设在阿比让。1973和1977年，喀麦隆和加蓬两国因成立自己的航空公司，相继退出非航。之后，多哥加入。现非航成员国有10个，职工5626人，大型客机11架，连接4大洲的40余个国家和地区，航线总长度为16万公里。
    28年来，非航在促进非洲国家旅游业、航空业、旅馆业和通讯业的发展、沟通非洲国家之间以及非洲与世界的联系、加速整个大陆的经济发展和社会进步方面发挥了重要的作用。创建之初，它每年的客运量只有28万人次，1978年增加到50万人次，去年已达到100万人次。它的运货量也较当时增加了3倍多。
    近年来非航遇到的主要难题：一是某些成员国拖欠的款项迟迟不交，致使非航财政吃紧，债台高筑，截至1987年底为止，它的财政赤字已达147亿西非法郎；二是人员膨胀，人浮于事的现象十分严重；三是财务纪律松懈，到处乱发优待票，允许本国官员免费乘机的事更是司空见惯等。由于上述原因，非航的经济效益愈来愈差。非航的这种运营情况引起了各成员国的严重忧虑和不安。
    1987年3月，在由其成员国国家元首参加的尼亚美会议上，与会代表将重振非航的使命委托给了科特迪瓦总统博瓦尼。1988年8月，各国首脑又在贝宁首都科托努举行会晤，重申了这一委托。在这次会议上，博瓦尼总统将自己的设想通报给各国领导人，他的设想是：非航应取消其一切政治色彩，变成一个纯商业性机构，并用经济手段进行经营管理，为此，必须聘请一个成员国之外的专家担任总经理。去年12月下旬，卡萨布兰卡法非首脑会议一结束，博瓦尼便前往法国，要求法国在整顿和重振非航方面给予帮助，并邀请法国经济合作中央银行行长罗朗出任总经理一职。罗朗欣然接受并在对该航进行一番调查研究之后，提出了这个长达50页的“罗朗计划”。
    这个计划的主要内容是：首先裁减冗员，从现在起到今年年底为止将解雇2000名职工，不考虑他们是来自哪个国家，也不考虑他们是否有“靠山”，对被解雇人员，非航均给以较多的补偿，使他们能够另谋生计；废除原来由各成员国选派定额人员参加非航工作的办法，改为根据需要公开招聘；此外，还要改革工资政策，使其更能激励职工的积极性；建立更加严格的财会制度，杜绝一切浪费行为；更新信息系统等。
    在不久前召开的亚穆苏克罗会议上，各国首脑和代表一致批准了“罗朗计划”。再次体现了各成员国的团结合作精神。此地评论家认为，这是一个“强有力”的计划，是对非航施行的“大手术”。当然，执行这个计划的过程中，还将遇到这样那样的困难，也许还要付出代价，但“欲有所得，必有所失”。人们有理由期待非航以此为转机，逐步获得新生。（附图片）
