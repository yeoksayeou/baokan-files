    Gezhouba Ship Lock Forced to Close
    Our reporter in Wuhan, July 12th — Due to the influence of upstream waters from Sichuan, the Gezhouba Ship Lock was forced to close at 9:30 PM on the 11th. All passing ships have temporarily stopped operating.

    Starting from July 10th, the water level in the Sichuan section of the Yangtze River has been rapidly rising. The water level in Wanzhou upstream has surged from 18.7 meters on the 8th to 35.07 meters on the 12th. This has significantly increased the inflow into the Gezhouba Reservoir. By the afternoon of the 11th, the inflow had exceeded 60,000 cubic meters per second.

    葛洲坝船闸被迫封航
    本报武汉7月12日电　受长江上游川水的影响，葛洲坝船闸已于11日晚9时半被迫封航。过往船舶暂停运行。
    从7月10日开始，川江水位急剧上涨，仅上游的万县水位已由8日的18.7米，猛增到12日的35.07米。这样，使葛洲坝入库流量也大大增加。到11日下午已超过每秒6万立方米。　（桂慧樵）
