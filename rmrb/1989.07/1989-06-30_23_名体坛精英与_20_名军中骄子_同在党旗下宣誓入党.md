On the evening of June 29, 23 sports elites, including Xu Yánméi and Gāo Mǐn, and 20 soldiers from the Beijing martial law troops stationed in Chongwen District, who had distinguished themselves in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, solemnly faced the party flag and took the oath to join the party.

Among these new party members, there are outstanding soldiers who have built immortal merits for defending the capital of the Republic, and there are outstanding athletes who train diligently, compete tenaciously, and have repeatedly brought honor to the motherland. They have practiced their wish to join the party with their advanced deeds and exemplary actions. Especially during the turmoil in the motherland, they have shown their unwavering loyalty to the party with their actual actions and have passed the party's test. In late April, diving champions Xu Yánméi, Gāo Mǐn, and Tán Liángdé went to the United States to participate in the World Cup diving competition. Some American reporters tried to get them to express support for the student protests, but they, with their filial hearts for the party and the motherland, sternly exposed the malicious intentions of the reporters. A certain telephone squad leader, Wáng Déshī, has been in the army for three years and has been commended six times in a row. In late May this year, despite his mother's serious illness at home, he voluntarily applied to perform martial law duties. On the night of June 3, when he entered the city, he was injured in multiple places by stones, but with his tenacious will, he led his entire squad to the designated martial law location, connected eight lines, and ensured the smooth command of the headquarters.

    23名体坛精英与20名军中骄子
    同在党旗下宣誓入党
    本报讯　6月29日晚，许艳梅、高敏等23名体坛精英和在平息北京反革命暴乱中立下功勋的驻北京崇文区戒严部队王德诗、董正勇等20名战士，庄严地面对党旗，举行了入党宣誓。
    在这些新党员中，有为保卫共和国首都而建立不朽功勋的优秀战士，有训练刻苦认真，比赛顽强拚搏，多次为祖国争得荣誉的优秀运动员，他们用自己的先进事迹和模范行动实践了自己的入党愿望，特别是在祖国发生动乱时，以对党的无比忠诚，用实际行动经受了党的考验。跳水名将许艳梅、高敏、谭良德4月下旬赴美参加世界杯跳水比赛期间，美国有的记者要他们表态支持学潮，他们以对党和祖国的赤子之心，义正词严地揭穿了他们的险恶用心。某电话班长王德诗，入伍三年来，连续六次获得嘉奖，今年5月下旬，他不顾家中母亲病重，主动申请执行戒严任务，6月3日晚进城时，身上多处被石块砸伤，仍以顽强的毅力带领全班到达指定戒严地点，架通了八条线路，保证了首脑机关指挥的畅通无阻。
