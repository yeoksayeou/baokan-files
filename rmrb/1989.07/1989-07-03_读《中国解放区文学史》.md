Croce said that all history is contemporary history, which is a meaningful statement. It goes without saying that the materials used in historical works are the remnants of past eras, but the selection, arrangement, and interpretation of these materials inevitably reflect the intentions of contemporary people. Thus, what people mistakenly believe to be objective historical facts is not the history of past events, but rather the history narrated by historians based on their own understanding. No matter how much historians claim to objectively judge history, they cannot avoid expressing their contemporary subjectivity. In this sense, Croce's words hold some truth. Therefore, the quality of a historical work does not solely depend on whether it accurately records historical events, but also on whether it reflects the advanced level of contemporary thought and the strong contemporary relevance that arises from it. If we use this perspective to view "A History of Literature in the Chinese Liberation Areas" edited by Liu Zengjie, it is undoubtedly a worthy read.

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the work of rectifying wrong tendencies in the ideological sphere was carried out, and the long-standing "leftist" tendencies within the Party were corrected. When studying the literary phenomena of the liberation areas, the author also attempts to break free from the shackles of "leftism," to excavate the forgotten literary phenomena that should not be discarded, such as the criticism of "art for art's sake," and to let the passage of time justly wash away the impurities, and to re-examine the old cases that have already been settled in literary history, such as the criticism of "Li Ping's Worries" and the debate over "performing grand operas." When interpreting works, the author stands at the height of today's era, seeing in the character of He Ni from "The Sun Shines over the Sanggan River" Ding Ling's challenge to the theory of bloodline, and in the fragments of Liu Qing's "The Record of Planting Grain," seeing that after peasants have liberated themselves politically and economically, they must also undergo ideological enlightenment to free themselves from the spiritual prison of small-scale production. Thus, the author discovers meanings and values that were not previously recognized, and in a certain sense, this can be seen as a kind of subjective creation that goes beyond the writer's consciousness based on a full understanding of the writer. What is even more commendable is that, under the influence of the systematic method, the author has made bold attempts in writing literary history, overcoming the shortcomings of past literary histories that only listed individual writers, and paying attention to placing writers in groups for examination. The author believes that the literary creation in the liberation areas formed a landscape of four peaks: social analysis novels represented by Ding Ling, popular novels represented by Zhao Shuli, lyrical novels represented by Sun Li, and news-style novels represented by Liu Baiyu. These four accomplished writers are all members of a larger group of writers, belonging to the same artistic school and artistic family, and to the society around them with similar tastes. When people hear their resonant voices, they can also hear the chorus of their respective surroundings. In this way, the achievements of other writers are not erased, and outstanding writers stand out due to their own representativeness. The author comprehensively grasps the literature of the liberation areas, paying attention to placing it in a broader context, believing that the literature of the liberation areas ended, but the literary movement of the same nature did not stop. The literature from 1949 to 1976 is a continuation of this literary movement, and together with the literature of the liberation areas, it constitutes a complete system of workers, peasants, and soldiers literature. The literature of the liberation areas is merely a brilliant stage of this system. This periodization method breaks away from the original modern literature periodization based on the stages of social development, and is more in line with the inherent laws of literary development, and thus more rational.

From the "Afterword" of this book, we know that the author has aspirations for writing the history of the workers, peasants, and soldiers literary movement, hoping that with the passage of time, the author's views on this issue will become clearer, and in the future, a work with contemporary relevance will be produced.

    读《中国解放区文学史》
    何德功
    克罗齐说，一切历史都是当代史，这是一句颇有意味的话。不用说史书所用的材料都是过往时代的折戟沉沙，但对材料的选择、安排和解释却又无不体现着当代人的意向，这样，人们误以为是客观实际的历史就并非死去的事件的历史，而是史家根据自己的理解处理过的述说的历史，不论作者怎样声称客观地评判历史，都无法避免自己作为当代人的主体意识的表现，从这个意义上说，克罗齐的话是有几分道理的。因此，史书的好坏就不完全在于是否真实地记载了历史事件，还要看它是否反映了当代思想认识的先进水平，以及由此而产生的强烈的当代性。如果用这个观点来看刘增杰同志主编的《中国解放区文学史》，无疑是一部值得一读的佳作。
    党的十一届三中全会以后，思想领域进行了拨乱反正的工作，党内长期存在的“左”的思潮得到了纠正。在研究解放区文学现象时，作者也力图摆脱“左”的羁绊，钩沉被人遗忘的“对艺术至上主义”的批判等还不应消失的文学现象，让大浪淘沙似的时间去公正地磨洗，并重新审视文学史上已有定论的旧案，如对《丽萍的烦恼》的批判、“演大戏”的争论等。在解读作品时，作者站在今天时代的高度，从《太阳照在桑干河上》中的黑妮身上看到丁玲对泛血统论的挑战，从柳青的《种谷记》的片断看到农民在政治、经济上翻身之后，还必须进行思想启蒙，才能使他们从小生产者的精神囚笼中解放出来，从而发掘出过去人们没有意识到的意义和价值，在某种程度上可以说是一种在充分理解作家的基础上超越作家意识范围的主体创造。更为可贵的是，作者在系统论方法的影响下对文学史的写法做了大胆的尝试、研究作家克服了过去文学史单个作家排列的缺欠，注意把作家放在群体中去考察，认为解放区的文学创作形成了以丁玲为代表的社会剖析小说，以赵树理为代表的大众化小说，以孙犁为代表的抒情小说，以刘白羽为代表的新闻体小说四峰对峙的格局。有成就的四位作家都是众多作家的一员，属于同时同地的艺术流派和艺术家族，属于他们周围而趣味和他们一致的社会，人们在听到他们响亮的声音的同时，还可以听到他们各自周围的齐声合唱。这样，既没有抹杀其它作家的成绩，优秀的作家也因其自身的代表性而显得伟大。整体把握解放区文学，注意放在更为广阔的背景上，认为解放区日期结束，与解放区文学同一性质的文学运动并没有终止，四九年至七六年之间的文学均为这一文学运动的延续，与解放区文学合起来，构成一个完整的工农兵文学系统，解放区文学仅仅是这个系统的光辉阶段。这种分期方法打破了以社会发展阶段分期的现代文学的原有格局，更符合文学发展的自身规律，因而更具合理性。
      从本书的《后记》我们知道作者对写作工农兵文学运动史抱有憧憬，希望随着时间的推移，作者对这一问题再探讨时，模糊的观点会明晰起来，在未来的岁月里写出一部具有未来的当代性的著作来。
