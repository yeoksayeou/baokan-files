The Shandong Cable Factory, named a "National Exemplary Enterprise in Ideological and Political Work," has integrated ideological and political work into its production and operational processes, achieving notable results.

The factory insists on strengthening ideological education for its workers. At the suggestion of Factory Director Li Tianzuo, the factory established a political work office this spring. The director and office staff frequently visit workshops and work units, seriously listening to workers' voices and even their complaints. When the director learned that wire drawing workers' gloves were thin and of poor quality, he immediately addressed the issue. To alleviate the concerns of workers who travel for work, the factory prioritizes these workers in housing and gas supply.

The factory also uses bulletin boards, factory newspapers, lectures, and discussion meetings to educate workers on the "one central task and two fundamental points." Because the factory has been proactive in its ideological work, it does not need to resort to last-minute measures when facing challenges. During the summer disturbances in some places this year, the factory maintained orderly production and work.

    山东电缆厂融思想工作于生产
    本报讯　被命名为“全国思想政治工作优秀企业”的山东电缆厂，将思想政治工作融汇于生产经营过程之中，取得明显成效。
    该厂坚持对职工加强思想教育。在厂长李田祚的提议下，这个厂今年春设立了政治工作办公室。厂长及政治办公室的同志经常深入车间、班组，认真听取职工的呼声乃至牢骚。当厂长得知拉丝工人的手套薄、质量较差后，便立即解决；为解除外出人员的后顾之忧，工厂在住房、煤气供给等方面对这些同志优先照顾。
    该厂还利用黑板报、厂报、演讲会、座谈会等形式对职工进行“一个中心两个基本点”的政治教育。由于这个厂平日“多烧香”，所以，一旦遇到风浪用不着临时“抱佛脚”。在今年夏天一些地方出现动乱的情况下，这个厂生产、工作秩序井然。
