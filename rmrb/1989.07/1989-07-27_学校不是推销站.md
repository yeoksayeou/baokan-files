Title: Schools Are Not Sales Outlets

The middle school I attend had an unusual incident: the school required each student to pay 1.7 yuan to purchase "Water Lily" brand detergent produced by a factory in our county. The school claimed that this detergent was of better quality than "Vital 28," but its brand was not yet well-known, so they came to the school to promote it.

Since detergent is not a school supply, many students were unwilling to pay this fee. However, since the school holds the "book of life and death" (diplomas), in the end, "the arm couldn't twist the leg," and everyone paid the money. The students had a lot of complaints about this.

Schools are places to cultivate talents needed by society, not sales outlets for factories. If you say your product is better than others, you can compete with them in the market. Why bring it to school to sell? If every factory's product, before becoming famous, uses schools to increase its popularity, can students and parents bear it? We have reason to ask: did the school receive "advertising fees" or "kickbacks" from the factory for this forced sale?

Forcing students to buy things they don't want to buy not only goes beyond the school's business scope but also damages the school's reputation. This is truly picking up "sesame seeds" and losing the "watermelon." I hope that schools will not have similar incidents in the future, allowing teachers and students to focus their main efforts on improving teaching quality.

### 学校不是推销站

    学校不是推销站
    郑新涛
    我所就读的中学出现过这样一件怪事：学校规定每个学生都必须交1.7元钱用来购买本县某厂生产的“水仙”牌洗衣粉，并说此洗衣粉的质量比“活力28”还好，只是牌子还没有打出去，所以到学校来做宣传。
    由于洗衣粉不是学习用品，许多同学不愿交这笔钱。但由于“生死簿”（毕业证）被学校掌握着，所以终究“胳膊”没扭过“大腿”，大家还是如数交了钱，对此同学们的意见很大。
    学校是培养社会所需人才的场所，而不是厂家的推销站。你说你的产品质量比人家的好，可以拿到市场上同人家竞争，为何要弄到学校来卖呢？假若每个厂的产品在没有出名前，都通过学校来提高其产品的知名度，学生和家长受得了吗？我们有理由提出疑问：学校这样强行派售，是不是收了厂家的“广告费”或“好处费”呢？
    强令学生购买他们不愿买的东西，既脱离学校的业务范围，也影响了学校的声誉，这真是捡了“芝麻”丢了“西瓜”。希望学校以后不要再出现类似的现象，让师生们把主要精力投放到提高教学质量上来。
