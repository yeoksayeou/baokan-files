Recently, I visited 15 villages in 7 townships in my county. These villages are located in mountainous, hilly, and plain areas, some are relatively wealthy, and some are relatively poor. However, they all have one thing in common: harmonious relations between cadres and the masses, high prestige of cadres, effective communication, and advanced work, which are praised by the people.

What is their secret?

Cadres are honest and upright, and handle matters seriously and fairly. The party branch of Xiaoguanyu Village in Zhaozhuang Township insists on not accepting gifts, not attending banquets, and not yielding to intercession, thus winning the trust of the people. In recent years, the village has earned more than 100,000 yuan from an iron mine, but none of the village cadres have taken a single cent of ill-gotten money. The party branch secretary of Beicheng Village in Lincheng Township, in the work of family planning this year, divided the objects of sterilization or contraception into five batches: the first batch is his own family, the second batch is his relatives, the third batch is party members, the fourth batch is those whom the people think have a good relationship with him, and the last batch is the people. In just two days, all the family planning objects in the village underwent surgery.

Cadres lead by example, working hard and doing practical things for the people. After taking office in 1988, the party branch secretary of Guandu Village in Haozhuang Township, Yu Jinbao, made every effort to raise 2.3 million yuan to build the first village-run enterprise. When purchasing equipment, in order to save expenses, he and the village committee director Zhang Qinghe sometimes brought their own food to Lincheng, to Xingtai, and to Beijing. The enterprise was established and made a profit, but he lost several pounds. Less than a year after taking office, the village had successively established a brick factory, a quartz stone mining site, a flour processing plant, and more. At the same time, he led the people to dig 7 wells, intercept 3 underground flows, level 70 mu of land, plant 2,200 apple trees, graft 30,000 peach trees, and plant 1,200 persimmon and pear trees. Someone said: "I like such hardworking and practical leaders."

Developing collective enterprises to bring benefits to the people. During the investigation, almost all cadres reflected that it is difficult to manage a poor household. Therefore, these villages attach great importance to the development of collective enterprises, bringing some benefits to the people. For example, the party branch of Gangtou Village in Lincheng Township, while leading the people to develop commodity production, actively developed village-run enterprises, successively establishing 11 collective enterprises. In 1988, the village realized a profit of 600,000 yuan, with a per capita income of 820 yuan. Not only have all kinds of village levies and allocations been paid from the collective enterprise income since 1984, but irrigation and lighting have also been provided free of charge. Therefore, the leadership of this village has great appeal.

Paying attention to work methods and doing a good job of guidance. Rural cadres are at the grassroots level, and everything is at the focal point of contradictions, making it difficult to work. For example, work items such as family planning, collecting various allocations, allocating residential plots, and purchasing grain, cotton, and oil all have hard indicators, and it is difficult to report to superiors if they are not completed; if measures are strict and the face is cold, the people will have objections. Therefore, paying attention to work methods and doing a good job of guidance is very important. The cadres of Dongchuan Village in Haozhuang Township explain everything to the people, treat them equally, and do detailed and in-depth ideological work. Over the years, the village has not had a single case of revenge against cadres or criminal cases, no one has made false accusations, the village has a good atmosphere, order is maintained, and the people live and work in peace and contentment, becoming a famous "reassuring party branch" and "civilized village" in the county.

Making government affairs public and accepting supervision from the people. In these 15 villages, most have implemented the system of publicizing government affairs, especially making some doubtful and hot issues public and transparent, allowing the people to supervise. Zhongxin Village in Liangcun Township uses mass meetings, political meetings, broadcasts, and bulletin boards to publicize the collective finances, land allocation, cadre subsidies, and cadre term targets that the people are concerned about, increasing the transparency of work, improving the prestige of cadres, and enhancing the cohesion of the leadership. Last year, the work of this village ranked first in the township in all aspects.

    新形势下如何密切农村干群关系
    河北临城县委  王根保
    最近，我走访了我县7个乡镇的15个村。这些村分布在山区、丘陵、平原，有的较富裕，有的较贫困，但共同的一点是干群关系融洽，干部威信高、说话灵、工作先进，受到群众称赞。
    他们的奥秘在哪里呢？
    干部清正廉洁，办事认真公道。赵庄乡下贯峪村党支部坚持做到送礼不要，吃请不到，说情不动，赢得了群众的信赖。近年来，村里开铁矿收入10多万元，村干部没有人拿过一分昧心钱。临城镇北程村党支部书记，今年在计划生育工作中，把实行节育或绝育手术的对象分成5批：第一批是自己家里的人，第二批是自己的亲戚，第三批是党员，第四批是群众认为和自己关系好的人，最后才是群众。仅两天时间，全村计划生育对象全部施行了手术。
    干部带头苦干，为群众办实事。郝庄乡官都村党支部书记岳进保1988年走马上任后，多方奔走，集资23万元建成了第一个村办企业。在购买设备时，为了节约开支，他和村委主任张清河有时带着干粮下临城，上邢台，跑北京。企业办成了，盈利了，他却掉了几斤肉。他上任不到一年，村里就先后办起了砖厂、石英石开采场、面粉加工厂等，同时他还带领群众打井7眼，截潜流3处，垫地70亩，栽苹果树2200棵，嫁接枣树3万多株，栽柿子、梨树1200多棵。有的人说：“俺就喜欢这样肯吃苦办实事的当家人。”
    发展集体企业，为民带来实惠。调查中，几乎所有干部都反映：穷家难当。于是，这些村都非常重视发展集体企业，给群众带来一些实惠。如临城镇岗头村党支部在带领群众发展商品生产的同时，积极发展村办企业，先后办起了11个集体企业。1988年，全村实现利润60万元，全村人均收入820元，不但1984年以来村里的各种提留统筹全部从集体企业收入中支付，而且还免费浇地、照明。因此，这个村领导班子很有号召力。
    讲究工作方法，做好疏导工作。农村干部身在基层，事事处在矛盾焦点上，工作起来难度大。如计划生育、征收各种统筹、分配宅基地、征购粮棉油等项工作都有硬指标，完不成对上难交待；措施硬点，脸色冷点，群众又有意见。因此，讲究工作方法，做好疏导工作十分重要。郝庄乡东川村干部凡事对群众晓之以理，平等待人，做细致深入的思想工作。多年来，全村没有发生过一起报复干部案件和刑事案件，没有一个乱告状的，村风淳正，秩序井然，人民安居乐业，成为全县闻名的“放心党支部”和“文明村”。
    政务公开亮底，接受群众监督。这15个村中，大多实行了政务公开制度，尤其是把一些疑点、热点问题公开亮底，让群众监督。梁村乡忠信村利用群众会、议政会、广播、公告栏等形式，将群众关心的集体财务、房基地划分、干部补贴、干部任期目标等内容，全部公开亮底，增加了工作透明度，提高了干部威信，增强了班子凝聚力。去年，这个村的各项工作名列全乡之首。
