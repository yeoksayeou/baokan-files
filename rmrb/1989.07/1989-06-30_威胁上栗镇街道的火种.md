Shangli Town in Pingxiang City, Jiangxi Province, faces numerous fire hazards. Many electrical circuits are overloaded, with old and deteriorated wires frequently causing short circuits, power outages, and sparks. Many transformers are not installed according to electrical fire safety standards but are instead placed within residential areas. Sparks from these transformers often fall onto the roofs of residents' homes and pedestrian walkways. Additionally, the town's three main streets have only three fire hydrants.

The fire prevention department of the Shangli District Public Security Bureau has issued a notice to the local government and the relevant electrical authorities, urging them to address these major fire hazards. Unfortunately, these fire hazards in Shangli Town remain unresolved to this day.

    威胁上栗镇街道的火种
    江西萍乡市上栗镇街道存在着众多的火灾隐患。不少电路负荷大，电线陈旧老化，时常出现断路、停电、冒火花等不安全现象。不少变压器未按电气防火要求安装，而是设置在居民住宅区内。变压器发出的火花，经常落在居民房屋顶上和人行道上。另外，全镇3条主要街道只有3个消火栓。
    上栗区公安分局消防科曾向当地政府和电力主管部门，送发了一份重大火灾隐患整改通知书。遗憾的是，上栗镇的这些火灾隐患至今还未消除。
