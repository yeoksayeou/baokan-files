He will also meet with the leadership of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), including Sam Nujoma, in Zambia.

    新华社温得和克7月21日电　联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔今天表示，他有信心看到纳米比亚将在11月6日如期举行自由、公正的选举。
    德奎利亚尔今天结束了对纳米比亚的3天访问前往南非。
    他在临行前在机场举行的记者招待会上还说，他对联合国驻纳米比亚特别代表和联合国过渡时期援助团的工作感到满意。
    在谈到同南非驻纳米比亚行政长官皮纳尔的会谈时，他说，双方就履行联合国435号决议的各个方面进行了务实的和坦率的讨论，但并不是在所有问题上都取得了一致。
    据悉，德奎利亚尔在会晤南非外长皮克·博塔之后，还将在22日从南非前往赞比亚同卡翁达总统会谈。
    他在赞比亚还将同西南非洲人民组织领导人努乔马会谈。
