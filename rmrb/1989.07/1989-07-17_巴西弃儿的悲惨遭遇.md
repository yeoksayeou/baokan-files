Late February, in a church in the violent-prone slum of Borel in Rio de Janeiro, 68-year-old Dutch priest Mariano was suddenly shot in the abdomen. He was immediately rushed to the hospital.

This priest came to Brazil 35 years ago. In this church, he had taken in 15 abandoned children aged 12 to 15. Not long ago, 14-year-old Pingha was kidnapped by drug traffickers. He had gone to the police station to ask how to get Pingha back. The officer promised to find a lawyer connected with the drug traffickers to help. But he never expected that the drug traffickers would also target him. The assailant was named Celso, 20 years old, abandoned by his parents at the age of 4. The priest had tried to help him, and Celso knew the priest's character, but under the instigation of the drug gang, he went to the church to commit the crime.

According to reports, Father Mariano had previously exposed the drug gang's crimes of harming children.

In the slums of Rio de Janeiro, there are about 2 million residents, and drug gangs have significant influence there. Many children have become the "little partners" of drug dealers. Due to the widening gap between the rich and the poor in Brazil, 36 million children nationwide live in poverty, and 7 million of them have been abandoned. They wander the streets and alleys of the city. Drug traffickers offer high prices to hire them to sell drugs. A child can earn $200 a month, while the minimum monthly wage for Brazilian workers is only $64. Once the drug trafficking activities are exposed, these children who know the inside story are often the first to be killed. Moreover, they are often the victims of gang wars between drug traffickers over territory. Statistics show that last year alone, 350 abandoned children were killed in Rio de Janeiro.

The Brazilian National Children's Welfare Foundation has established some schools to take in 4,600 abandoned children, but the results are minimal. Father Mariano has been engaged in the work of taking in abandoned children for many years and has received support from the church. Although he was targeted for assassination by the drug gang this time, he did not change his original intention. In the hospital, he told visitors, "People are bound to die, but they should do something of value."

    巴西弃儿的悲惨遭遇
    2月底的一天，在里约热内卢暴力活动频繁的波雷尔贫民区的一座教堂里，68岁的荷兰神父马里亚诺突然中弹，腹部被打穿。他立即被送进医院。
    这位神父是35年前来到巴西的。他在这个教堂里收养了15个12岁至15岁被遗弃的孩子。14岁的平哈不久前被贩毒分子绑架了，他曾找警察局询问，如何把平哈找回来。警官答应找与贩毒分子有联系的律师帮忙。但他没想到贩毒分子竟然对他也下了毒手。凶手叫塞尔索，20岁，4岁时就被父母抛弃，神父曾想帮助他，他也了解神父的为人，然而，他却在贩毒集团的唆使下到教堂行凶。
    据报道，马里亚诺神父曾经揭露过贩毒集团残害儿童的罪行。
    里约热内卢的贫民区约有200万居民，贩毒集团在这里势力很大。许多孩子成了贩卖分子的“小伙计”。巴西由于贫富悬殊日益严重，全国有3600万儿童生活在贫困之中，被人抛弃的儿童，就有700万。他们流落在城市的大街小巷。贩毒分子出高价雇用他们去卖毒品，一个孩子一月可以挣到200美元，而巴西工人的最低月工资也不过64美元。贩毒活动一旦败露，这些知道内情的孩子往往首先遭到杀害。另外，他们也常常是贩毒团伙之间为争夺地盘进行枪战的牺牲品。据统计，去年仅在里约热内卢就有350名弃儿被杀害。
    巴西全国儿童福利基金会创办了一些学校，收容了4600个被抛弃的儿童，但收效甚微。马里亚诺神父从事收养弃儿的事业已经多年，得到了教会的支持。他这次虽然遭到贩毒集团的暗杀，但并不就此改变初衷。在医院里，他对来访者说，“人总是要死的，但应该做点有价值的事情”。
