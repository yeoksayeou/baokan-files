Despite the changes in modern life that have altered modern people's aesthetic concepts, the demand for a high level of skill and mastery remains consistent, regardless of whether it is ancient or modern, traditional or avant-garde.

For instance, in martial arts performances, when an actor flips down from a height of two and a half tables and lands not on his buttocks but on both feet, and then continues singing after a showy pose, it is quite impressive. The renowned actress Fei Yanling from the Hebei Bangzi Opera Troupe, known for her exceptional singing and acting skills, performed as Zhong Kui and had this ability, earning prolonged enthusiastic applause from the audience. However, being in her middle age, she still made a "thud" sound upon landing. The audience understood, and it is likely that she made no sound when she was younger. The young performers in the Peking Opera class at the Yanjing Drama School in Liaoning Province's Yingkou City also perform flips without any sound, as does the young star Wu Suying from the Xiaohua Yue Opera Troupe in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province. It is estimated that as they age, they will still be able to flip, but one day they will also make a "thud" sound. This is because martial arts require not only skill but also physical condition, and youth is the best time for such feats. However, the aesthetic evaluation of "falling to the ground without a sound" is likely to be agreed upon by everyone.

The high standards and strict requirements in technique reflect an eternal and universal aesthetic ideal that has existed since ancient times: a state of tranquility and purity without any impurities.

Consider the four famous poets of the Song Dynasty and their discussions on "falling to the ground without a sound," and you will understand that tranquility is not about having a low spirit and a dead heart. Instead, it contains a hint of vibrant spring, a piece of beautiful peace, and a wish for goodness, although it hopes for clarity, elegance, and purity.

Su Shi: The ink flower falls to the ground without a sound, and looking up, I see Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong asks Bao Shu, "Why don't you plant bamboo?" Bao Shu says, "Just a few stalks are enough; the breeze will naturally be sufficient."

Qin Guan: The snowflake falls to the ground without a sound, and looking up, I see Bai Qi. Bai Qi asks Lian Po, "Why don't you raise geese?" Lian Po says, "White feathers cover the green water, and red feet stir the clear waves."

Huang Tingjian: The woodworm dust falls to the ground without a sound, and looking up, I see Confucius. Confucius asks Yan Hui, "Why don't you plant plum blossoms?" Yan Hui says, "In the deep snow of the previous village, a branch bloomed last night."

Foyin Chan Master: The heavenly flower falls to the ground without a sound, and looking up, I see the treasure light. The treasure light asks Vimalakirti, "How is the monk's journey?" Vimalakirti says, "When encountering a guest, the head is like a cloak; when encountering a meal, the neck is like a goose."

The falling of ink flowers, snowflakes, woodworm dust, and heavenly flowers without a sound is a natural phenomenon. The "falling to the ground without a sound" in art, however, requires human cultivation and cannot be achieved without effort. This requires overcoming great difficulties and resolving a sharp contradiction.

In popular songs, there are powerful performances. Are powerful performances the same as screaming and shouting? No. Audiences in Hangzhou say, "It's too loud." "Loud" is a negative evaluation by Hangzhou people of performers who sing powerful songs poorly.

Reportage should have a personal touch. However, if it is filled with "I" and "me" everywhere, it is easy to give readers the impression of using someone else's achievements to promote oneself.

Chinese painting is moving towards the avant-garde. When the advantages of hybridization have not yet been formed, observation and continued experimentation are needed, not hype. If the concept is revealed to the level of a leaflet or a big-character poster, it becomes a propaganda piece, and such propaganda, which is far from art, is said to have always been despised by avant-garde art.

The ancients said, "Understanding human nature and society is the essence of literature." This literature also needs art. In Nixon's memoirs of the Sino-US talks, he praised Zhou Enlai's diplomatic demeanor, saying that he was always firm and yet courteous. When he had the upper hand, his voice became even softer.

    落地无声
    陈幸德
    尽管现代生活使现代人的审美观念发生了一些变化，但对于技艺功力成熟程度的要求，却不论古今，不论老派新潮，都是一致的。
    例如看武功戏，功夫演员从两张半桌子的高空倒翻下来，落地时不是屁股着地，而是两脚稳住，并且做个亮相动作，继续唱下去，就很不简单。河北梆子剧团做唱双绝的女明星斐艳玲演钟馗就有这个本事，激起观众长时间热烈掌声。不过，她毕竟人到中年，落地时到底还有“嘭”的一声。观众能谅解，想必她年少之时未必落地有声。辽宁省营口市戏曲学校京剧班的娃娃们翻跟斗就没有声音，浙江绍兴小百花越剧团小明星吴素英翻脱空跟斗也是没有声音的。估计随着年岁增长，翻还会翻，但总有一天也会“嘭”的作响。因为武功除了技艺还要靠身体条件，吃的是少年饭。但“落地无声”作为肯定性审美评价，怕是大家都没有意见的。
    技术上的高标准和严格要求，反映的其实是亘古以来既永恒又普遍的审美理想之一，那就是宁静的、纯一无杂的境界。
    试玩味宋代四名诗人关于“落地无声”对课，就可知所谓宁静也并非就是低眼黄泉心如死灰，它倒是有一丝盎然春意，有一片美好和平及善良的愿望在其中，只不过要“芳草鲜美、中无杂树”，希望明净、雅洁、纯粹而已。
    东坡：笔花落地无声，抬头见管仲。管仲问鲍叔，如何不种竹？鲍叔曰，只须三两竿，清风自然足。
    秦少游：雪花落地无声，抬头见白起。白起问廉颇，如何不养鹅？廉颇曰，白毛铺绿水，红掌拨清波。
    黄鲁直：蛀屑落地无声，抬头见孔子。孔子问颜回，如何不种梅？颜回曰，前村深雪里，昨夜一枝开。
    佛印禅师：天花落地无声，抬头见宝光。宝光问维摩，僧行近如何？维摩曰，遇客头如氅，逢斋项如鹅。
    笔花雪花蛀屑天花落地无声出诸自然之理。艺术功夫的“落地无声”则非人为修养而不逮。这需要克服很大的困难，解决一个尖锐的矛盾。
    流行歌曲里有劲歌。劲歌是否就是歇斯底里撕破嗓子，尖叫呢？不。杭州观众说：“太炸了。”炸，就是杭州人对劲歌唱得不得法演员的否定性评价。
    报告文学应有“我”。但随处我呀我呀地与主人公形影不离，就容易给读者留下借他人事业为自己表功的印象。
    国画正在向新潮靠拢。当着杂交优势尚未形成的时候，需要观察和继续试验而非鼓噪。观念直露到了类似传单和大字报水平，那就等于宣传品，而这种遥距艺术的“宣传”，据说向来连新潮艺术也不齿。
    古人说，人情练达即文章。这文章也需要艺术。尼克松回忆中美谈判赞美周恩来外交风度说，他总是那样坚定不移而又彬彬有礼，当他手里有牌的时候，说话的声音反而更加柔和了。
