In the 277 train, thieves colluded with train police and attendants to commit crimes, which has recently been solved. Eight criminals, including Huang Lin, have been arrested by law.

Investigation revealed that on October 7, 1988, Huang Lin, a worker from the construction section of the Taiyuan Railway Bureau, stole 13,000 yuan in cash from a private entrepreneur from Hebei Province, Zhang Xiaoguan, on the 277 train from Taiyuan to Fangzi. Huang then handed the money to the train police officer, Zhao Jie, to hide, and told Zhao that the money was stolen. After the victim noticed that the money was stolen by Huang, he reported the case to Zhao. However, Zhao deliberately delayed the investigation. The victim discovered that Zhao was acquainted with Huang and followed them to the terminal station. Only then did Zhao return the money to the victim, claiming that Huang had found the money.

In mid-January 1989, Huang stole a leather bag containing a video camera worth 3,000 yuan on the 277 train and handed it to the attendant, Mao Jinwei, who was aware of the situation, to hide.

On February 24, 1989, Huang, along with the escaped re-educated laborer, Lü Hongping, and the worker from the passenger transportation section of the Taiyuan Railway, Suo Xucheng, again boarded the 277 train. They stole a password box containing 10,000 yuan in cash and 60,000 yuan in bank drafts. Huang handed the 10,000 yuan in stolen money to the attendant, Li Jun, who was aware of the situation, to hide. Li then handed 2,000 yuan to the attendant, Wang Huashi, to hide. After the train arrived in Taiyuan, they each took a portion of the stolen money.

Zhao Jie and another train police officer, Gao Yulong, also took advantage of their positions and opportunities to collude and protect criminals from committing crimes on the train. They repeatedly extorted large amounts of money and goods from the criminals. Among them, Gao Yulong extorted 2,000 yuan, and Zhao Jie extorted over 1,000 yuan.

    经查，1988年10月7日，太原铁路分局建筑一段工人黄林在太原开往坊子的277次列车上，盗走河北省个体户张小贯1.3万多元现金，而后将巨款交给乘警赵杰窝藏，并告诉赵杰此款系偷窃所得。失主觉察到巨款是被黄林偷窃后向赵杰报案，而赵杰故意拖延时间，不去追查。失主发现赵杰与黄林相识，一直跟到终点站后，赵杰才不得不以黄林找到此款为由退还失主。
    1989年元月中旬，黄林在277次列车上窃了一个内装价值3000元录相机的皮包，交给知情的乘务员毛晋伟窝藏。
    1989年2月24日，黄林、劳教在逃人员吕红平和太铁客运段工人索旭晨等人再次窜到277次列车上，合伙盗窃了一个内装1万元人民币和6万元汇票单的密码箱。黄林将1万元赃款交给知情的列车员李军窝藏，李军又将其中2000元交列车员王化诗窝藏。车到太原后，他们各得一部分赃款。
    赵杰还和这趟列车另一乘警高育龙利用职权和工作之便，相互勾结，包庇犯罪分子在列车上大肆作案，先后向犯罪分子索取大量钱物，其中高育龙索取人民币2000元，赵杰索取人民币1000余元。
