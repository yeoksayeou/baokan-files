It is understood that China currently has 16 easy-open can production lines with an annual production capacity exceeding 2 billion units. The aluminum materials used in production are largely imported, requiring the country to spend a significant amount of foreign exchange...

Currently, easy-open canned beverages are ubiquitous in the Chinese consumer market. Beverages that were originally relatively inexpensive become one to two times more expensive once packaged in easy-open cans, which is not in line with the consumption level of the general public. Moreover, the recycling rate of easy-open cans is only around 60%. A beautifully printed, lightweight easy-open can costs over 1.3 yuan to produce, but after being used once, it is only worth about 0.1 yuan at a recycling station! However, easy-open canned beverages are currently very popular among young people and are also quite prevalent at banquets funded by public funds. Some people say this is a "modern touch."

According to reports, the "Metal Beverage Can Reuse Design Exhibition (Competition)" sponsored by the Nash Exchange Company of New York State, USA, and co-hosted by the Jiangsu International Exhibition Company, opened on May 20 at the Jiangsu Provincial Art Museum. The exhibition features 429 works, including practical items such as lamps and solar water heaters, as well as decorative artworks like murals and figurines, and toys such as trains, airplanes, and spacecraft. It is said that this is an example of the magic of empty easy-open cans being reused to benefit humanity.

However, I believe that while efforts are made to reuse empty easy-open cans and guide people to make them into decorative artworks or toys through exhibitions, it is still like "adding sesame seeds to a candy," and currently, who has the time and who can make these things?

The current issue is to strengthen macro-control and restrict the production of easy-open cans; at the same time, develop an export-oriented economy, and mainly use the produced easy-open canned beverages for export. The domestic market should still focus on the consumption level of the general public and promote the development of affordable beverages.

### 再说“易拉罐”

    再说“易拉罐”
    ●祖丁远
    据了解，我国现有16条易拉罐生产线，年生产能力超过20亿只，生产用铝材绝大部分赖于进口，国家要花费大量外汇……
    目前在我国消费市场，易拉罐饮料到处可见。原先较为便宜的饮料，一旦装进易拉罐内，价格就提高一至二倍，与群众消费水平很不相称。且易拉罐若要重新回炉利用，回收率也仅60％左右。一只印制美观的轻巧易拉罐壳，生产成本费用为人民币一元三角以上，用过一次，拿到废品站只值一角钱！可是，当今易拉罐饮料在青年中倍受青睐；在公款吃喝的酒宴上也颇盛行。有人说这是“现代化派头”。
    据报载，由美国纽约州纳氏交流公司主办、江苏省国际展览公司协办的“金属饮料罐再利用设计展览（比赛）”，5月20日在江苏省美术馆开幕，展出的429件作品，有灯具、太阳能热水器等实用物品，有壁画、人物形象等工艺装饰品，有火车、飞机、航天器等玩具。据说这是空易拉罐可再现魔力，造福人类的实例。
    但我以为，虽然设法把用过一次的空易拉罐进行再利用，现又通过展览，指导人们做成工艺装饰品或玩具，但毕竟是“糖饼上剥芝麻”，而且目前的情况，又有哪些人有这么多工夫，哪些人做得成这些东西呢？！
    当前的问题，是要加强宏观控制，对易拉罐的生产加以限制；同时发展外向型经济，生产的易拉罐饮料主要用于出口。国内市场还是应该从人民群众的消费水平和节约出发，发展适宜普及的饮料。
