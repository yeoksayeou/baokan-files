Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 6th.

The reporter Wang Jinhu learned from the National Finance Work Conference held in Beijing today that the execution of the national budget for the first five months of this year is still not ideal, with slow income growth and excessive expenditure growth, and the severe fiscal situation has not been alleviated.

According to statistics, from January to May this year, the national domestic fiscal revenue was 8.5198 billion yuan, completing 31.7% of the annual budget, an increase of 7.6% over the same period last year; the national domestic fiscal expenditure was 8.298 billion yuan, completing 30% of the annual budget, an increase of 15.9% over the same period last year; after deducting income and expenditure, the surplus was 221.8 million yuan, lower than the same period last year.

Vice Premier and Minister of Finance Wang Bingqian analyzed the budget execution situation for the first five months of this year at the meeting. He pointed out that the main reasons for the slow income growth in the first five months are that the economic structure has not been truly adjusted. The industrial output value of state-owned enterprises increased by 6.3% compared to the same period last year, the industrial output value of collective-owned enterprises increased by 17.7%, and the industrial output value of township enterprises increased by 24.2%, which greatly affected the state finance that mainly relies on state-owned enterprises for income. At the same time, the economic benefits of enterprises have declined. In the first five months of this year, the industrial output value of budgetary enterprises increased by 5.3% compared to the same period last year, profits decreased by 9.2%, and profits remitted decreased by 38.4%. In addition, some new revenue measures arranged in this year's national budget, such as the collection of the national budget adjustment fund and special consumption tax, have not been well implemented, which also affected the progress of income.

Wang Bingqian said that in the first five months of this year, except for a few projects where fiscal expenditure decreased compared to the same period last year, most projects have increased. The expenditure of some projects that the state has determined to control and reduce has not only not been reduced but has increased compared to the same period last year. For example, the administrative management fee budget was arranged to increase by only 2.5%, but the actual increase was 23.6%.

Wang Bingqian believes that the severe fiscal situation has brought great pressure to achieve this year's budget targets. If it is not solved in time, it will not only be unfavorable for the rectification and adjustment and the alleviation of inflation, but will also increase the difficulties for next year's finance and affect the sustained and stable development of the national economy. Therefore, he requires all levels of financial and tax departments to seriously implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, steadfastly carry out the rectification and adjustment, and strive to organize income and control and reduce expenditure. Strict budget management and supervision must be ensured to fully complete the national budget tasks for this year. From now on, all aspects of the work must be mobilized to carry out the "double increase and double saving" campaign in a solid manner; immediately organize the cleanup of overdue and occupied fiscal revenue, strictly manage tax collection, and plug loopholes; and focus on enterprise loss reduction and profit increase, and implement various revenue measures.

    今年财政形势严峻局面未缓解
    王丙乾强调采取措施确保完成国家预算
    本报北京7月6日讯　记者王锦鹄从今日在此间召开的全国财政工作会议上了解到，今年头5个月国家预算执行情况仍不理想，收入增长缓慢，支出增长过快，财政形势严峻的局面尚未缓解。
    据统计，今年1至5月份，国内财政收入851.98亿元，完成年度预算的31.7％，比去年同期增长7.6％；国内财政支出829.8亿元，完成年度预算的30％，比去年同期增长15.9％；收支相抵，收大于支22.18亿元，低于去年同期的水平。
    国务委员兼财政部长王丙乾在会上分析今年预算执行情况时指出，1至5月份收入增长缓慢的主要原因是经济结构还未真正调整，全民所有制工业产值比去年同期增长6.3％，集体所有制工业产值增长17.7％，乡办工业产值增长24.2％，这使主要依靠国营企业取得收入的国家财政受到很大影响。同时，企业经济效益下降。今年头5个月，预算内工业企业产值比去年同期增长5.3％，实现利润下降9.2％，上交利润下降38.4％，此外，今年国家预算安排的一些新的增收措施，如征收国家预算调节基金，特别消费税等落实情况不好，也影响了收入进度。
    王丙乾说，今年头5个月除少数项目财政支出比去年同期减少外，大部分项目都有增加。国家确定必须控制和压缩的一些项目支出不仅没压下来，反而比去年同期增加。例如，行政管理费预算只安排增长2.5％，实际增长23.6％。
    王丙乾认为，财政严峻形势已给实现今年预算目标带来很大压力，如不抓紧解决，不仅不利于治理整顿，缓解通货膨胀，而且将加重明年财政的困难，影响国民经济持续稳定发展。为此，他要求各级财税部门认真贯彻十三届四中全会精神，坚定不移搞好治理整顿，千方百计组织收入，大力控制和节减支出，严格预算管理和监督，务必保证全面完成今年国家预算任务。从现在起，要动员各方面力量，扎扎实实开展双增双节运动；立即组织清理拖欠和占压财政收入的工作，严格税收征管，堵塞漏洞；狠抓企业扭亏增盈，落实各项增收措施。
