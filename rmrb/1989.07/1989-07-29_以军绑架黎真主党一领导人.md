	Israeli Forces Kidnap a Hezbollah Leader in Lebanon

	Our reporter Lin Jiaoming reports from Cairo on July 29: Israeli special forces launched a night raid on a village in southern Lebanon on the 28th, kidnapping a leader of the pro-Iranian Lebanese Shia Muslim Hezbollah.

	Under the cover of darkness and the sound of heavy bombardment, Israeli special forces landed by helicopter near the village of Jibshit, about 3 kilometers north of the "security zone" in southern Lebanon. Twenty-five special forces soldiers quickly infiltrated the village, surrounding the residence of Hezbollah leader Obeid. They used a silenced pistol to kill a villager who had noticed the operation and attempted to resist.

	The special forces tied up Obeid's wife and five children with ropes, locking them in the bedroom, and forcibly took Obeid and his two aides onto the helicopter, then flew them to Israel.

	Obeid, 36, is a leader of the Hezbollah militia organization and was educated in Iran. Israel accuses him of planning the 1986 kidnapping of three Israeli soldiers and the abduction of a U.S. diplomat.

    以军绑架黎真主党一领导人
    本报开罗7月29日电　记者林皎明报道：以色列特种部队28日凌晨偷袭黎巴嫩南部村庄，绑架亲伊朗的黎巴嫩穆斯林什叶派真主党领导人。
    以色列特种部队在夜幕和猛烈轰炸的爆破声掩护下，乘直升机降落在黎巴嫩南部“安全区”以北数公里吉卜希特村附近3公里处。25名特种部队军人迅速潜入村内，包围了真主党领导人奥贝德的住宅，用无声手枪打死一名发觉这次行动并准备反抗的村民。
    特种部队人员用绳索捆绑奥贝德的妻子和5个儿女，把他们反锁在卧室内，强行将奥贝德和他的两名助手劫持上直升机，然后押往以色列。
    奥贝德，今年36岁，是真主党民兵组织的领导人，在伊朗受过教育。以色列指控他策划1986年劫持3名以色列士兵及绑架美国外交官的行动。
