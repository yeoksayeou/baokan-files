In a small courtyard at No. 4 Taijichang Street in Beijing, I knocked on a door. An elderly woman with gray hair appeared before us. Ah, this is Chen Xijian. "Mother! Your son has come to see you."

The old mother was taken aback. After I explained the situation of that day, she tightly grasped my hand and sat down with me on the sofa. She said, "That day, you all saw it. If I were a young and strong man, I would have fought with those bad guys to the death!"

The "that day" Chen Mother referred to was June 3, around 3 AM. "At that time, I was sleeping with my grandson. My daughter-in-law was frantically knocking on the door and shouting, 'Mom, something happened. The soldiers entering the city were attacked by a group of people.' Hearing my daughter-in-law's words, I was startled. Thinking about some recent abnormal incidents, I didn't care about my startled grandson's cries, didn't even bother to change my pajamas, and stumbled out to the street. Someone like me, 57 years old, usually walks carefully during the day, but that night, in the dark, I ran to the street."

That day, we witnessed Chen Mother's actions after she arrived at Dongchang'an Street. The early morning after the rain was still a bit chilly, but Chen Mother was only wearing her pajamas. She saw three young and strong men dragging a young soldier and rushed over without hesitation. "Where are you taking him? He is my son," Chen Mother shouted as she tried to snatch the soldier from the thugs.

The thugs stopped. Seeing Chen Mother's distress, they had no reason not to believe that the soldier was her son. They laughed wildly, "Today, you're lucky to meet your mother. For the sake of being fellow Beijingers, we'll let you go."

Chen Mother said, "I sent this soldier to the Public Security Ministry compound and then returned to the street. I saw some thugs beating up the soldiers, some even throwing stones, sticks, and bicycles at them. These soldiers, wearing only white shirts and carrying water bottles and raincoats, were beaten until they were injured. But not one of them fought back. My heart was broken. Who doesn't have children? How could it not be heart-wrenching?"

We saw Chen Mother rush into the crowd again. The crowd was pushing and shoving, and even many young and strong men were sweating profusely. Chen Mother, with all her strength, pulled a soldier through the crowd, saying, "Child, come with me. I will take you to a safe place." Someone in the crowd shouted, "Where are you taking him? Who are you to him?" Chen Mother stood up straight and said confidently, "He is my son." Then, she took the soldier to the Municipal Committee compound. Like this, she walked back and forth, saving more than ten soldiers and taking them to the Public Security Ministry, the Municipal Committee compound, and her own home.

By 5 AM on June 3, our team had been chased from the east gate of the Public Security Ministry to Dongdan intersection.

"Don't hit them! Stop hitting them! These two are my sons!" This was Chen Mother's voice again.

"Bang!" A brick flew and hit the electric pole less than a meter away from Chen Mother. Then, a man rushed to Chen Mother and roared, "Old woman, how many sons do you have? You've taken so many soldiers away, where did you send them?"

Recalling this, Chen Mother stood up from the sofa and said, "At that moment, I was also enraged. I said, these soldiers are all my sons. Hit me to death! The few men were so angry they couldn't do anything. In the end, they still let the two soldiers go. Why? Because I am an old woman. The thugs also knew that with so many people on the street watching, if they also hit this old woman, their lies would be exposed. I saw this point and came back to call the neighbors in the courtyard to go out and save the soldiers. That day, by 8 AM, I and the neighbors from our courtyard protected more than 70 martial law troops."

Chen Mother also said, "When it was light, a group of thugs searched our courtyard. They saw dozens of soldiers eating hot noodles, bread, and eggs, drinking milk, malted milk, and hot water, and they were so angry they wanted to go crazy. They shouted for us to release the soldiers and said that if we didn't release them, they would burn the courtyard with people and houses. At that time, I was the first to stand at the big iron gate and shouted loudly, to kill or burn, I alone will take responsibility. At that time, I had already decided to fight to the death with any thug who dared to rush into the courtyard. Even if it cost my life, I couldn't let the soldiers be taken away. Around noon, the thugs dispersed. I thought there might still be scattered soldiers on the street, so I pulled two sisters from the neighborhood committee and went out to look. We walked to Dongdan Park, my feet and legs were sore, and I was panting. But as soon as I thought about whether there were still soldiers in the park, I got my energy back. I entered the park and searched everywhere until evening before returning home. I was so tired I collapsed, didn't even have dinner, and fell asleep on the bed."

"Chen Mother, you are almost 60 years old. Where did you get such great courage?" We asked as we parted with Chen Mother. Chen Mother told us, "When I was young, my family was very poor. At 15, I joined the army in my hometown. At that time, the struggle was very fierce. It was the common people who protected us, and I deeply understood that the PLA cannot do without the common people. This time, the PLA entered the city to carry out martial law, precisely to prevent our country from changing color. They were attacked by thugs, and we should stand up to help."

    妈妈
    李春元　刘润生
    在北京台基厂大街4号小院里，我敲开了一户家门。一位花白头发的老人出现在我们的面前。啊，这就是陈喜珍。“妈妈！儿子看您来了。”
    老妈妈愣住了。待我说明那天的情况后，她紧紧抓住我的手，让我和她一起坐在沙发上。她说：“那天你们都看到了。我要是个年轻力壮的小伙子，非得和那伙坏人拚了不可！”
    陈妈妈说的“那天”，是指6月3日凌晨3点。“当时我正带着小孙子睡觉。儿媳妇慌慌张张一边敲门一边喊着，‘妈，出事了，大街上进城的解放军让一伙人给打了。’听了儿媳的话，我吓了一跳，联想到近来发生的一些不正常现象，于是顾不上受惊的小孙子哭叫，连睡衣也没顾上换，就跌跌撞撞地跑到了大街上。像我这57岁的人，平时白天走路都小心谨慎，那天黑漆漆的却一溜小跑上了街。”
    那天，我们亲眼看到了陈妈妈来到东长安街后的举动。雨后的凌晨还有几分寒意，而陈妈妈只穿着那件睡衣。她见3个年轻力壮的家伙扭着1名年轻战士走来，便不顾一切地冲了过去。“你们把他带到哪儿去？他是我的儿子。”陈妈妈一边喊着，一边去抢夺歹徒抓住的战士。
    歹徒住手了，看看陈妈妈伤心地将战士紧紧地搂到跟前，没有理由不相信这个小战士就是陈妈妈的儿子。于是他们狂笑着：“今天这日子碰上妈，算你走运。看在北京老乡的份上，放了你。”
    陈妈妈说：“我把这个小战士送到公安部大院，又返回到大街上，看见一些歹徒对着解放军正拳打脚踢，有的竟拿石块、棍棒和自行车往解放军身上砸。这些只穿着白衬衣，带着水壶雨衣的解放军，被打得头破血流，有的身负重伤。但没有一人还手。我的心都碎了，谁没有个儿女，怎不叫人心痛呢？”
    我们亲眼看到了，陈妈妈又一次冲进人群。人群在拥挤，连许多年轻力壮的小伙子都给挤得满头大汗。陈妈妈凭着全身气力在摇摆的人群中拉着一个战士说：“孩子，跟我走，我会把你送到安全地方”。人群中有人大叫起来：“你把他带到哪儿去？你是他什么人？”陈妈妈理直气壮地挺起身子说：“这是我的儿子。”然后，她把这个战士送到了市委大院。就这样，她徒步往返，接连把十几名解放军战士送到了公安部、市委大院和自己家中。
    6月3日5时，我们的队伍已从公安部大门东口被追打到东单路口。
    “别打了，你们快别打了，这俩全是我的儿子！”这又是陈妈妈的声音。
    “叭！”一块砖头飞来，重重地砸在距陈妈妈不足1米远的电线杆上。接着，一个家伙冲到了陈妈妈面前，恶狠狠地嚎叫：“你这个老婆子，到底有多少儿子？你抢走了那么多当兵的，都送哪儿去了？”
    回忆到这里，陈妈妈腾地从沙发上站起来说：“那阵子我也急了。我说，这些解放军都是我儿子，你们打死我吧，气得那几个家伙无可奈何。最后还是把两个战士放开了。为什么呢？因为我是个老太太，歹徒们心里也明白，街上那么多人看着，如果他们也来打我这老婆子，那他们编造的谎言就露馅了。我看准了这一点，就回来招呼院里的邻居们，发动他们也上街去救解放军。那天，到上午8点，我和我们小院里的邻居一起，保护起了70多名戒严部队官兵。”
    陈妈妈还说：“天亮了，一伙歹徒搜寻到了我们小院的门口，他们看到几十名解放军正在吃着热乎乎的面条、面包和鸡蛋，喝着牛奶、麦乳精和开水，气得要发疯了，叫喊着要我们放人。还说，如不放人，就把小院连人带房全烧了。这时，我第一个站到了大铁门口，大声喊道，要杀要烧由我一人负责。当时我说这话的时候，就已经想到了要和敢冲进院来的歹徒拚了。就是拚上老命，也不能让战士们被抢走。快到晌午的时候，歹徒们散去了，我想街里还有被冲散的官兵，就拉上居委会的两位大姐，到街上去转，转到东单公园，累得脚酸腿麻，连连喘气。但是一想到公园内是不是还有战士，劲头就来了。进了公园，我到处寻找着，直到晚上才回家来。我累瘫了，晚饭也没吃，就倒在了床上。”
    “陈妈妈，您是快60的人了，哪来的那么大的勇气呢？”和陈妈妈分手时我们问道。陈妈妈这样告诉我们：“我小的时候家里很穷，15岁在老家参军。当时斗争很残酷，是老百姓掩护我们，使我深深懂得了解放军离不开老百姓。这次解放军进城执行戒严任务，就是为了使我们国家不变色。他们遭到了歹徒的围攻，我们应该挺身帮助。”
