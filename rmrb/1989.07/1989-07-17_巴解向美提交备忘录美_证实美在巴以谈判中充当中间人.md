Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, July 16th - According to the Palestinian News Agency, the Palestinian Ambassador to Tunis, Barawi, handed over a memorandum from the PLO to the U.S. Ambassador to Tunis, Pelletreau, last night. The memorandum criticizes the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, John Kelly, for his July 13th speech to the U.S. Congressional Foreign Affairs Committee, which the PLO claims misinterpreted the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue.

Kelly asserted that the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue was not open-ended and that no progress had been made in six months. The memorandum points out that the U.S.-Palestinian dialogue, which began in Tunis last December, was established as a significant dialogue and was not intended to cover up Israeli political conspiracies and repression policies.

Barawi, during his meeting with Pelletreau, expressed concern over the escalation of Israeli repression against residents of the occupied territories. He criticized the U.S. government for its indifference to the inhumane crimes committed by the Israeli occupation authorities.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 16th - U.S. National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft today confirmed that the U.S. has played an informal mediating role in the talks between Israel and the PLO regarding elections in the occupied territories. Scowcroft revealed this information during an interview with the American Columbia Broadcasting Company. He stated that the U.S. is currently working to advance the election process, "therefore, it is natural that we are talking to the Israelis and also to the Palestinians."

Scowcroft noted that this approach differs from that of a "mere messenger." Earlier, U.S. officials confirmed that U.S. Ambassador to Tunis, Pelletreau, had held two secret meetings with the second-in-command of the PLO, Abu Iyad. The U.S. side stated that these meetings were intended to explore the possibility of holding elections in the occupied territories.

    巴解向美提交备忘录美
    证实美在巴以谈判中充当中间人
    新华社突尼斯7月16日电　据巴勒斯坦通讯社报道，巴勒斯坦驻突尼斯大使巴拉维昨晚在这里向美国驻突尼斯大使佩莱特鲁转交了巴解组织致美国政府的一份备忘录。
    备忘录批评美国负责中东事务的助理国务卿约翰·凯利13日向美国国会外交委员会的讲话企图对美、巴对话作出错误的解释。
    凯利声称，美、巴对话并不是无限期的，并认为6个月来对话未获得任何结果。
    备忘录指出，美、巴对话从去年12月14日在突尼斯开始时就被确定为一项重要的对话，其目的不是要用来掩盖以色列的政治阴谋和镇压政策。
    巴拉维在同佩莱特鲁会谈时表示，巴勒斯坦领导人对以色列对被占领土居民的镇压的升级感到忧虑。他批评美国政府对以色列占领当局不断犯下的惨无人道的罪恶行径无动于衷。
    新华社华盛顿7月16日电　美国国家安全事务顾问斯考克罗夫特今天证实，在以色列和巴解组织之间有关在被占领区举行选举的谈判中，美国担任了一个非正式的中间人的角色。
    斯考克罗夫特是在接受美国哥伦比亚广播公司采访时透露这一情况的。他说，美国目前正在努力做的就是要推动选举进程，“因此，很自然我们正在同以色列人谈，也在同巴勒斯坦人谈”。
    斯考克罗夫特说，这一做法有别于“只传递信息的中间人”。
    早些时候，美国方面还证实，美国驻突尼斯大使佩莱特鲁曾同巴解组织的第二号人物阿布·伊亚德举行过两次秘密会晤。
    美国方面表示，这些会晤只是为了探讨在被占领区举行选举的可能性。
