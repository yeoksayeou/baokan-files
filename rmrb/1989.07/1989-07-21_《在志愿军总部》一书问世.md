People's Daily reports that the memoir "At the Headquarters of the Volunteer Army," which reflects the Korean War, has recently been published by the PLA Press. The author of the book is Dù Píng, the former political commissar of the Nanjing Military Region. He was also one of the six leaders who first entered North Korea at the headquarters of the Volunteer Army and served as the director of the Political Department of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army. He was also the deputy secretary and secretary of the Party Committee of the Volunteer Army delegation at the Kaesong Armistice Talks.

In this 400,000-word magnum opus, he provides a comprehensive and authentic account of his personal experiences during the Korean War, detailing the entire process of each major battle and the Kaesong Armistice Talks. The book also reveals, for the first time, some little-known historical facts.
