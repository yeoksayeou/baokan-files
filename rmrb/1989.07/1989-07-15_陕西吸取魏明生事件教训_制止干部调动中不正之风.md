The issue of "Mr. Banquet" Wei Mingsheng using his transfer as an opportunity to accept banquets and gifts has sparked strong reactions in society. The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have seriously reviewed the lessons learned and taken measures to firmly stop the unhealthy practices of party cadres accepting banquets, gifts, and other forms of corruption during transfers.

In early April, after Wei Mingsheng's problem was exposed, the provincial government immediately issued regulations stating that using public funds for banquets and gifts would result in "whoever proposes it pays for it." Recently, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government jointly issued a document to strictly enforce the discipline of cadre transfers at all levels and to firmly stop corrupt behaviors among party cadres. The document stipulates that after receiving a transfer notice, cadres must complete their handover procedures within the time specified by the organization and report to their new positions on time. They are not allowed to use public funds or vehicles for tourism. During the departure and arrival of cadres, no unit is allowed to use public funds for banquets, gifts, or mass welcoming activities. They are not allowed to accept any form of banquet invitations, gifts, or purchase local specialties at low prices. Violations of these regulations will result in accountability, and disciplinary actions will be taken based on the severity of the offense.

    陕西吸取魏明生事件教训
    制止干部调动中不正之风
    据新华社西安7月15日电  （记者万武义）“吃喝专员”魏明生借调动之机吃喝拿的问题连续曝光后，在社会上激起强烈反响。陕西省委、省政府认真总结教训，采取措施，坚决制止党员干部调动中请客送礼，吃请受礼等不正之风。
    今年4月上旬，魏明生的问题披露后，省政府当即作出了：用公款请客送礼“谁出主意谁出钱”的若干规定。最近，省委、省政府为了严肃各级党政干部调动的纪律，坚决制止党员干部中的腐败行为，联合下发文件规定：干部在接到调动通知后，必须按组织规定的时间交接手续，按时到新单位报到上班，不准借机动用公款、公车旅游；在干部离任、到任时，任何单位不准用公款搞请客送礼或搞群众性的迎接活动，不准以任何名义接受宴请、收受礼品或低价购买土特产品，对于上述规定如有违犯，必须追究责任，视其情节给予党纪、政纪处分。
