The 14th Asian Amateur Boxing Championships will commence tomorrow in Beijing. Twelve foreign teams have already arrived and are all staying at the luxurious Olympic Hotel.

This is the first time China has hosted this official international boxing event, which is not only a biennial highlight of the Asian amateur boxing scene but also the highest-level "combat rehearsal" before next year's Asian Games. Therefore, all the strong teams have selected their best fighters and assembled their strongest lineups. The order of play, issued by the organizing committee, includes almost all the famous amateur boxers in Asia today. Experts believe that the upcoming competition will not only showcase various styles and schools but also reveal the latest landscape of the Asian amateur boxing world. The president of the International Amateur Boxing Association, Chaudhry, has declared that "this competition is a major event in Asian boxing," and has personally led the vice-presidents and executive committee members of the International Amateur Boxing Association to Beijing to observe the games.

According to an official from the organizing committee, all preparations for this elite gathering are proceeding smoothly and are now fully complete. Including three Chinese international referees, all the referees have passed the assessment, and the draw for the 12 weight classes will take place tomorrow morning.

    亚洲业余拳击锦标赛各队抵京
    本报北京7月22日讯　记者缪鲁、温子建报道：第14届亚洲业余拳击锦标赛将于明天在此间展开角逐。12支外国参赛队已全部抵京，均下榻在富丽堂皇的奥林匹克饭店。
    中国首次承办的这一正式国际拳击赛，不仅是亚洲业余拳坛两年一度的盛会，亦是明年亚运会前水平最高的一次“实战演练”，因而，诸路劲旅无不挑选精兵强将，排出最佳阵容。在组委会印发的秩序册上，当今亚洲著名业余拳击手几乎尽在其中。行家们据此认为，即将开始的比赛，在展示各种风格流派的同时，亦将展示亚洲业余拳坛的最新格局。国际业余拳联主席乔杜里则认定“这次比赛是亚洲拳击运动中的一件大事”，并亲率国际业余拳联的副主席和执委们，于日前抵京观赛。
    据组委会负责官员称，这次精英荟萃、华盖如云的赛事，各项准备工作进展顺利，业已全部就绪。包括三名中国国际裁判在内的执法官均通过考核，12个级别的抽签将在明天上午进行。
