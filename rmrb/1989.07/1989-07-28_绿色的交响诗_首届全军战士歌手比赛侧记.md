A green symphony,
A three-dimensional military camp painting.
In the first national military soldiers' singer competition, young singers from all over the country used their ideals, youth, songs, and extraordinary experiences to create a moving symphony and painting, showcasing the radiant appearance of contemporary soldiers.

Songs cannot be absent from the military camp, just as the earth cannot be without the seven colors of sunlight. Whether in the northern camps, the trenches of the southern border, the barren desert, or the lush palm groves, songs express the soldiers' hearts, drive away the fatigue of training, cultivate sentiments, and inspire fighting spirit. Songs have become good friends of the soldiers. Nanjing Military Region's Yu Honggao is one of the countless soldiers who love to sing. This 1.84-meter-tall, dark-faced quartermaster has built the famous Fuma Road across the country and was a drill operator in the Gugong Tunnel construction team, creating a high tunneling record during construction. Whenever he has a rest, he sings a song with his relaxed and deep male bass voice for his comrades. When he saw the competition news in the newspaper, he wrote a letter to the political director of the military region, recommending himself. After the preliminary selection, he came to Beijing and won the second prize in the bel canto group in the final with his naturally gifted voice.

Organizing singing activities is a tradition in the military camp. In the 1960s, the General Political Department proposed that the grassroots level should achieve "singing everywhere." By today, most military units have established a set of methods and systems for organizing singing activities, and new equipment such as tape recorders and audio systems have entered the military camp. In recent years, the General Political Department has repeatedly recommended vigorous and uplifting marching songs to the grassroots level of the troops, requiring organized singing. Many units also create their own lyrics and music, having their own unit songs. Based on this solid mass art foundation, under the strong advocacy of Yang Baibing, the director of the General Political Department, the singing and competition activities of soldiers have become more popular. This competition was proposed by Yang based on the wishes of the soldiers. Since last year, various large units of the military have held singer selection activities such as "Eastern Screen," "May Torch," and "Nanyue Cup." The Beijing Military Region even organized a soldiers' singer competition. Many of the singers participating in this competition are outstanding performers who emerged from these activities.

These hundreds of excellent singers from the grassroots level are like the grass on the vast plain, hanging with crystal dew and the fragrance of the earth, shining with the demeanor of contemporary soldiers on the stage with their simple and unadorned images. Soldiers are the guardians and creators of boiling life. They write and perform their own songs, singing out the main melody of loving the Party, loving the motherland, and loving the people, and also singing out their own voices. The song "I Will Definitely Come Back" was written by the leader of the Faka Mountain performance team, expressing the belief of the southern border guards, and once became a popular song on the battlefield. His performance in this competition made people feel particularly familiar. There are also songs like "The Soldier's Heart on the Island," "The Boy and the Missile," "Beautiful Shanxi, My Home," and "How Can Such Land Not Be Loved," all of which are filled with the atmosphere of military camp life. The singers participating in the competition have been guided by teachers and have studied diligently in the art, with good quality and level. Many people have also been at the forefront of various competitions. This time, the winner of the first prize in the bel canto group, Yuan Fazhan from the Lanzhou Military Region representative team, is a major staff member of the logistics department. The judges believe that he has a solid foundation, accurately understands the songs, and is rich in expressive power. Li Shuangjiang believes that his future is limitless. The winner of the first prize in the folk singing group, Zhao Li from the Air Force representative team, is a cultural officer in a certain communication regiment. Her performance of "Five Provinces People Laugh Together" is very difficult, but she controls it well, and the performance is appropriate, which is highly praised by the judges. Composer Wang Ming said with deep feelings: When I listened to her song, I was moved by the true feelings, and I even forgot the vocal method she used. The winner of the first prize in the popular singing group is Qiu Jiang from the General Political Department representative team. She is a erhu player from the Academy of Military Arts. Perhaps it is the artistic cross-over, making her "guest performance" a success. Judge Li Guangxi believes that she expresses her emotions accurately and handles them delicately. The growth of these new vocalists in the military camp makes the famous musicians inside and outside the military excited. Professor Li Xinchang said, "The amateur vocal level in the military is so high that it is beyond expectation. A common soldier can sing the famous song 'Old Man River,' which indeed shows that the military has talents." Professor Jin Tielin said, "This is a team with both strength and potential. These new stars, if trained and cultivated seriously, will produce singers." Indeed, military young singers Wang Xiufen, Yan Weiwen, Dong Wenhua, and others have all grown up from soldier singers. It can be said that the military camp is a fertile land for the growth of singers.

The singers participating in the competition are all active grassroots cultural backbones, and each of them has a series of moving stories of serving the soldiers. When they sing on the colorful stage, they always make people's minds overlap with the scenes of them crossing mountains and rivers to bring joy to their comrades. The winner of the second prize in the folk singing group, Lieutenant Zhang Shihong, was born in a small village in Heshun County, a folk song hometown in Shanxi. She joined the army two months later and went to the front line in Yunnan with the team. On New Year's Eve, she sang for the soldiers under the bundled light of a flashlight and was called the "nightingale of the battlefield." Ji Lingjie is a folk singer from the vast northwest, just 18 years old. Her unit is stationed in the Helan Mountains, a barren land where only camel grass grows, and life is very hard. However, she and her comrades often sing in the wind to inspire their spirits and temper their bones. Sometimes they sing so cold that their singing goes off-key, but their enthusiasm does not decrease. Some singers are stationed in the Tibet Plateau, some live deep in the mountains, some are on the Qinghai-Tibet Line, and some are by the sea. No matter where they are, they use all their artistic expertise to serve the soldiers and inspire their comrades with their songs. It is these singers and countless cultural backbones who make singing activities so popular and loved by the soldiers, making the military camp so full of vitality.

In the first national military soldiers' singer competition, a group of vocal talents emerged. They are emotionally sincere, skilled, and perform lively and vividly. The picture shows the first-place winner of the bel canto group, Yuan Fazhan (right), who is a major staff member of the Lanzhou Military Region; the first-place winner of the popular singing group, Qiu Jiang (middle), who is a member of the General Political Department representative team; and the first-place winner of the folk singing group, Zhao Li (left), who is a cultural officer in the Air Force. Look, how excited they are on stage receiving their awards!

    绿色的交响诗
    ——首届全军战士歌手比赛侧记
    孙军
    一部绿色的交响诗篇，
    一幅立体的军营画卷。
    在首届全军战士歌手比赛活动中，来自祖国天南地北的全军青年歌手，用理想、青春、歌声和不平凡的经历构成了动人的交响、组画，展示了当代军人的耀人风采。
    军营里不能没有美妙的歌声，就像大地上不能没有七色的阳光。无论在北方的营地，还是南疆的堑壕，或是荒凉的戈壁滩，或是苍翠的椰树林，歌声抒发了战士胸怀，驱走了训练的疲劳，陶冶了情操，激励了斗志，歌声已经成为战士的好朋友。像南京军区的俞宏高，就是千千万万个爱唱歌的战士中的一员。这位身高1.84米、脸膛黝黑的司务长，曾经修筑过闻名全国的福马公路，是鼓山隧道施工团的风钻手，在施工中开创过掘进高纪录。平时一到休息，他便用舒展浑厚的男低音，为战友们唱上一曲。当他从报上看到比赛的消息时，便给军区政治部主任写了封毛遂自荐信，经初赛选拔后来到北京，在决赛中以得天独厚的声音条件获得了美声组二等奖。
    开展歌咏活动是军营的传统。60年代，总政治部就提出了基层要做到“处处有歌声”的要求。时至今日，全军的团队基本都已建立了一套开展歌咏活动的方法和制度，而且收录机、音响组合等新器材已进入军营中。近年，总政治部又多次向部队基层推荐奋发昂扬的队列歌曲，要求组织学唱。许多团队还自己创作词曲，有了自己的团歌。在这雄厚的群众艺术基础上，经总政治部杨白冰主任的大力倡导，战士歌手演唱和比赛活动更为蓬勃普及。这届比赛就是杨主任根据战士们的愿望提议举办的。去年以来，全军各大单位举办了如“东线荧屏”、“五月火炬”、“南岳杯”等歌手选拔活动，北京军区还特意组织了一次战士歌手大赛。这次参赛的歌手中有不少就是从这些活动中脱颖而出的佼佼者。
    来自基层的这数百名优秀歌手，像广阔无垠的原野上的小草，挂着晶莹的露珠和泥土的芳香，以质朴无华的形象在台上闪烁着当代军人的英姿。战士们是沸腾生活的保卫者，也是创造者，他们自编自演，用歌声唱出了热爱党、热爱祖国、热爱人民的主旋律，也唱出了自己的心声。歌曲《我一定会回来》出自法卡山演出队队长之手，表达了南疆卫士的信念，曾一度成为阵地上的流行歌曲。这次他在比赛中的演唱，使人感到格外亲切。还有像《小岛战士心里话》、《小伙儿和导弹》、《美丽的山西我的家》、《这样的土地怎能叫人不爱恋》等，都流溢着浓郁的军营生活气息。参赛的歌手在艺术上经过了老师的指点和精心的钻研，有较好的素质和水平。许多人在各类比赛中还名列前茅。这次美声唱法一等奖获得者、兰州军区代表队的原发展，是后勤部的少校干事，评委们认为他有较扎实的基本功，对歌曲的理解准确而又富有表现力。李双江认为他的前途不可限量。民族唱法一等奖获得者、空军代表队的赵丽，在某通信团任文化干事，她演唱的《五州人民齐欢笑》难度很高，但她控制自如，表现恰当，很得评委赞叹。作曲家王酩深有感触地说：听她的歌时我被真情所打动，以至于忘了她运用的发声方法了。获得通俗唱法一等奖的是总政代表队的秋江，她是解放军艺术学院的二胡演奏员，大约是艺术上的触类旁通，使她的“客串”获得了成功。评委李光羲认为她表达情感准确而又处理细腻。这些军营声乐新人的成长，令担任评委的军内外著名音乐家兴奋不已。黎信昌教授说，部队业余声乐水平如此之高出乎意料，一个普通的士兵能唱名曲《老人河》，的的确确说明部队有人才。金铁林教授说，这是一支很有实力又很有潜力的队伍，这些新秀只要加以认真地训练和培养，是会出现歌唱家的。的确，军队青年歌唱家王秀芬、阎维文、董文华等都是从战士歌手成长起来的。可以说，军营就是一片生长歌唱家的沃土。
    参赛的歌手们都是活跃在基层的文艺骨干，每个人的身后都有一串为兵服务的动人事迹。当他们在五彩缤纷的舞台上歌唱时，总使人眼前叠印出他们跋山涉水为战友送欢愉的情景。获得民族唱法二等奖的少尉军官张世红，出身在山西民歌之乡河顺县的一个小山村里，她入伍两个月便随队到了云南前线。除夕之夜，她在手电筒集束光照明下为战士们演唱，被称为“战地百灵鸟”。吉玲洁是来自大西北的民族唱法歌手，刚满18岁。她所在的部队驻守在贺兰山里，是个只长骆驼草的不毛之地，生活十分艰苦。然而她和战友们时常迎风高歌，以激励志气，锤炼骨气，有时冷得将唱法都唱串了，声音走了调，但他们的热情不减。还有的歌手驻在西藏高原，有的住在大山深处，有的在青藏线上，有的在海滨，不论在哪里，他们都用自己所有的艺术专长，想方设法为兵服务，用歌声鼓舞战友。正是这些歌手和许许多多文艺骨干的努力，歌咏活动才这样受到战士的欢迎和喜爱，军营才如此生机盎然。（附图片）
