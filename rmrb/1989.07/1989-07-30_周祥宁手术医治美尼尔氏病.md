Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, July 30th.

Zhou Xiangning, the chief physician of the otolaryngology department at Tianjin First Central Hospital, has achieved an 80% cure rate for Ménière's disease using ear nerve microsurgery.

Zhou Xiangning began researching the surgical treatment of Ménière's disease in 1983. Through animal experiments and cadaver dissections, he initially mastered the technique of opening the membranous labyrinth and draining excess endolymph.

Since last year, the otolaryngology department of Tianjin First Central Hospital has performed nearly 50 such surgeries, with a 100% effective rate and an 80% cure rate. Over 40 patients have had their pain completely eliminated or significantly reduced.
