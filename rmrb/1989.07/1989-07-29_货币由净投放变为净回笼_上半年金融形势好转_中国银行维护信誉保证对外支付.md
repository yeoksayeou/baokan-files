    Currency Shifts from Net Injection to Net Withdrawal
    Financial Situation Improves in First Half of the Year
    Bank of China Maintains Reputation and Ensures Foreign Payments

    BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) — The overall financial situation in the first half of this year was better than expected, with currency being net withdrawn from January to June, compared to a net injection in the same period last year. This was revealed today by Li Guixian, State Councilor and Governor of the People's Bank of China, at a meeting with branch managers of the Bank of China.

    Li Guixian said that savings deposits increased by 64.4 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, and by 22.4 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. The scale of bank credit has been controlled, and the credit structure has been initially adjusted. In the first half of this year, various bank loans were significantly reduced compared to the same period last year. Foreign exchange income was slightly higher than expenditure, and the state's foreign exchange reserves increased. He said that the improvement in the financial situation is mainly due to the initial effects of implementing the rectification and adjustment policies.

    Li Guixian pointed out that the financial situation in the second half of the year remains severe. Although currency withdrawal has increased, it is still lower than the levels of previous years; the demand for funds is high, increasing the pressure on banks; the situation of irrational fund use remains serious; and foreign exchange balance faces certain difficulties. He said that the overall requirement for financial work in the second half of the year is still to tighten monetary policy, stabilize finance, and implement adjustments within the tight framework to promote the sustainable, stable, and coordinated development of the national economy.

    In another development, Li Guixian said today that the Bank of China faced significant pressure and impact from a run on the bank in June. The Bank of China, especially the colleagues in the Hong Kong and Macau branches and overseas branches, did not stop any external business. They timely coordinated and allocated funds, met customers' withdrawal requests at any time, ensured foreign payments, and maintained the country's and the Bank of China's international reputation.

    货币由净投放变为净回笼
    上半年金融形势好转
    中国银行维护信誉保证对外支付
    本报北京7月29日讯　记者计泓赓报道：今年上半年全国金融形势总的比预计要好，1至6月货币是净回笼，而去年同期则为净投放。这是国务委员兼中国人民银行行长李贵鲜今天在中国银行分行行长座谈会上透露的。
    李贵鲜说，今年上半年储蓄存款比年初增加644亿元，比去年同期增加224亿元。银行的信贷规模得到控制，信贷结构初步得到调整。今年上半年银行各项贷款比去年同期大大减少。外汇收入略大于支出，国家外汇结存有所增长。他说，金融形势好转，主要是贯彻治理整顿方针初见成效。
    李贵鲜指出，今年下半年金融形势仍是严峻的。货币回笼虽增加，仍低于前几年水平；资金需求大，给银行的压力增大；资金不合理占用的情况仍严重；外汇平衡遇到一定困难。他说，下半年金融工作总要求，仍然是紧缩银根，稳定金融，在紧缩中实施调整，以促进国民经济持续、稳定、协调发展。
    又讯　李贵鲜今天说，6月一场挤提风波，中国银行受到了很大压力和冲击。中国银行同志特别是在港澳中银集团和海外分行工作的同志，对外业务一天也没有停止。他们适时统筹调度资金，随时满足客户提存要求，保证了对外支付，维护了国家和中国银行的对外信誉。
