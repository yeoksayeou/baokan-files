The U.S. and the Soviet Union will hold expert-level talks in Stockholm from July 31 to August 1 to discuss issues related to Afghanistan and Iran.

The U.S. State Department spokesman, Boucher, said today that the Stockholm meeting is part of the ongoing regional dialogue between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

After the Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan in February, the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been working towards a political solution to Afghanistan's internal problems. The U.S. insists that the Najibullah regime must step down and continues to provide military aid to the resistance forces. The upcoming expert-level talks will aim to stop both superpowers from providing aid to the various political factions in Afghanistan. The U.S. has consistently accused the Soviet Union of continuing to supply weapons to the Kabul government.

Boucher said that the Stockholm talks will focus on all issues related to U.S.-Soviet relations with Iran.

According to reports, the U.S. negotiators will raise the issue of Iranian Speaker Rafsanjani's visit to Moscow last month. During the visit, Soviet leader Gorbachev agreed to help Iran strengthen its defense capabilities as part of a comprehensive economic cooperation plan.

The U.S. is currently trying to improve its relations with Iran, but so far, no progress has been made.

    美苏将举行专家级会谈
    讨论阿富汗和伊朗问题
    新华社华盛顿7月21日电  美苏两国将于本月31日至8月1日在斯德哥尔摩进行专家级会晤，讨论阿富汗和伊朗问题。
    美国国务院发言人鲍彻今天说，斯德哥尔摩会议是美苏两国正在进行地区性问题对话的一部分。
    在苏联军队今年2月撤出阿富汗后，美苏一直努力谋求政治解决阿富汗内部问题。美国坚持纳吉布拉政权必须下台，并继续向抵抗力量提供军事援助。即将举行的专家会议将努力使两个超级大国停止对阿富汗各派政治力量提供援助。美国一直指责苏联继续向喀布尔政权提供武器。
    鲍彻说，斯德哥尔摩会谈将集中讨论美苏两国同伊朗关系的所有问题。
    据报道，美国谈判代表将提出伊朗议长拉夫桑贾尼上月访问莫斯科一事。在访问中，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫已答应帮助伊朗加强国防力量，作为双方经济合作一揽子计划的一部分。
    美国目前正在努力改善它同伊朗的关系，但迄今未取得进展。
