Edition: 6

The series of books "Comparative Culture Between China and the West" is advised by renowned scholars Ji Xianlin and Fokkema (Netherlands) and edited by Le Daiyun. The first batch of five books: "Zhuangzi and Modernism," "Tianren Heyi and Shenren Heyi," "Cultural Spirit and Novel Concepts," "The Tree of Life and the Tree of Spirit," and "Confucian Spirit and Christian Spirit," are published by Hebei People's Publishing House.

Chinese traditional culture is profound and extensive, and Western culture also has abundant achievements. Due to historical "China-centrism" and "Eurocentrism," the two cultures have formed a situation of two peaks facing each other and two streams diverging. Which is superior? Since the May Fourth Movement, debates have continued to this day. Although there have been efforts by figures like Einstein, Joseph Needham, Arnold Toynbee, Jung, Ilya Prigogine, and even Heidegger to bridge the gap, they are still rare, and misunderstandings persist. Even in China, the pioneering work of scholars like Qian Zhongshu to "bridge the gap between East and West" has sparked "disgust" among some young scholars who seek to "break with tradition." Some advocate "Westernization," while others promote "national essence." Both sides are unyielding. How to resolve this stalemate? The solution lies in comparison.

From the content of the first batch of five books, it is evident that the series holds a reasonable and well-founded perspective on the comparison between Chinese and Western cultures. For example, the book "Tianren Heyi and Shenren Heyi" argues that China's "Tianren Heyi" has a strong function in resisting religious forces, while the West's "Shenren Heyi" cultivates a conscious awareness of sublime realms; the former emphasizes harmony between humans and nature, while the latter highlights the conflict between the soul and the flesh... both have "complementary" functions. As the editors of the series state in the "Preface": Communication can no longer be limited to a specific regional scope. The comparative studies within the Western cultural system, which were once centered on Europe, have given way to mutual reference and exploration between the Eastern and Western cultural systems.

    《中外比较文化丛书》介绍
    由著名学者季羡林、佛克玛〔荷〕为学术顾问、乐黛云任主编的《中外比较文化丛书》首批五本：《〈庄子〉与现代主义》、《“天人合一”与“神人合一”》、《文化精神与小说观念》、《生命之树与精神之树》、《孔子精神与基督精神》，由河北人民出版社出版。
    中国传统文化源远流长，西方文化也成果累累。二者由于历史上“中国本位主义”与“欧洲中心主义”的阻隔而形成双峰对峙、二水分流的局面。孰长孰短，自“五四”以来绵延至今，争议迭起。其中，虽有爱因斯坦、李约瑟、汤因比、容格、普利高津以至海德格尔的“沟通”工作，但毕竟凤毛麟角，隔膜仍然存在。就是在中国，如著名学者钱钟书等人“打通中西”的开拓性工作的努力，也在好些“打破传统”的青年学人中激起“反感”。要么“西化”，要么“国粹”，对立双方互不相让。如何解决这种僵局？只有进行比较。
    从这套丛书首批五本的内容看，在中西文化比较方面是持之有故言之成理的。如《“天人合一”与“神人合一”》一书认为：中国“天人合一”抵御宗教势力的强大功能，西方“神人合一”造就崇高境界的自觉意识；前者强调的人与自然的和谐，后者突出灵与肉的冲突……都有着“互补”的功能。正如丛书编者在《序》中所说：沟通，已不可能局限于某一地区范围，过去以欧洲为中心的、西方文化体系内部的比较研究已让位于东西方文化体系互为参照系、“互为主观”的比照和探寻。
