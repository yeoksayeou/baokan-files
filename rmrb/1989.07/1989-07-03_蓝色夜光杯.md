	The moonlight casts my distorted shadow, beauty is so limited. Condense myself into a roll of film, let those eager eyes slowly develop it.

	Black and white or color no longer matters. Black and white is emotion, color is also emotion. The rustling leaves awaken the confusion of the past, one path widens, one window closes.

	The dazed fingertips no longer dare to press the shutter, they say each click is one less, they say after dusk, one falls into the darkness before dawn. Darkness is so frightening, thus God created the man's arms to protect the ghost of love in all directions.

	Meeting you was simply a misunderstanding. When hearts intertwine, both sides have already gone blind. The ocean wind loses its runway upon landing, the white spire becomes the target of pursuit.

	The lace handkerchief frames the square memories, the charm shouts out from the whirlpool. The curved suspense is always written on tomorrow's calendar, from Monday to Sunday.

	Facing the blades of grass, how will your privacy be revealed to the earth? You wear the mask so lightly, completing the regret left from your childhood. Your dreams are always half-full, half-empty. Half ascend to heaven, half plunge into the abyss. No one has measured the distance from the abyss to heaven, how long it truly is?

	My sorrow is never shown on my face.

	Oh, Mother, you did not shed tears when you gave birth to me, yet your daughter's tear ducts are so developed. Gazing at your graying experiences, I can tell you nothing, your weary eyes stop the words of my heart...

	Perhaps, beauty is sorrow, ugliness is sorrow, being sentimental is also a kind of sorrow.

    蓝色夜光杯
    黄锦萍
    一
    月光投下我变形的身影，美丽多么有限。把自己浓缩进一盒胶卷，让那一双渴望的眼睛慢慢冲洗。
    黑白或是彩色已经不太重要。黑白是情，彩色也是情。沙沙作响的树叶摇醒昔日的困惑，那一条路宽了，这一扇窗闭了。
    发愣的指尖再也不敢按下快门，都说按一张少一张，都说过了黄昏，就会陷进黎明前的黑暗。黑暗那样怕人，因而上帝塑造了男人的臂膀，全方位护住爱的幽灵。
    二
    和你相遇简直是一种误会。心与心交融时双方都已经失明。海洋风着陆失去了跑道，白色塔尖成了追踪的目标。
    花边手绢围起方形记忆，情趣呼喊着冲出漩涡。弯弯的悬念总是写在明天的日历上，从星期始至星期末。
    面对一棵棵小草，你的隐私将如何向大地袒露？你这样轻松地戴上面具，完成你孩童时留下的遗憾。你的梦总是半圆半缺，我的梦却永远只完成一半。一半登上天堂，一半坠入悬崖。没有人丈量过，悬崖到天堂的距离，究竟有多长？
    三
    我的悲哀从不写在脸上。
    哦，母亲，诞生我时你不曾流泪，而女儿的泪腺又是这般发达。注视你花白的经历，我是什么也不能告诉你呀，你疲惫的眼神阻止了我心的诉说……
    或许，美是悲哀，丑是悲哀，多情更是一种悲哀。
