Deng Yingchao Meets Yamaguchi Toshio

Deng Yingchao reiterated that China's reform and opening-up policy will not be affected by the occurrence of riots or temporary difficulties.

Yamaguchi Toshio said that he was pleased to see that citizens in Shanghai and Beijing had resumed normal life.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 6th - Today in the morning, Deng Yingchao, Honorary President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, met with Yamaguchi Toshio, a member of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, former Minister of Labor, and his wife at the Xihua Hall in Zhongnanhai.

During the meeting, Deng Yingchao referred to Yamaguchi Toshio as an old friend who has contributed to Sino-Japanese friendship. She said, "Your visit to Beijing so soon after the riots have been quelled shows your enthusiasm for developing friendly relations between the two countries."

Yamaguchi Toshio said that he was pleased to see that citizens in Shanghai and Beijing had resumed normal life. Deng Yingchao asked him to share his observations and experiences in China with his Japanese friends upon his return, telling them that the Chinese government has the ability to maintain social order and stability.

When Yamaguchi Toshio mentioned that some foreigners were worried about the martial law not being lifted, Deng Yingchao said: Beijing's martial law is different from the concept of martial law in some foreign countries and is not as severe or frightening as they imagine. The People's Liberation Army is carrying out martial law duties to protect the normal lives and work of the people, and the activities of foreign friends will not be restricted or interfered with.

Yamaguchi Toshio said that China's reform and opening-up over the past decade have been highly evaluated internationally and have had an impact on the entire world. He hoped that China could overcome the current difficulties and that Chinese youth and leaders would unite and work together to move towards the 21st century.

Deng Yingchao reiterated that China's reform and opening-up policy will not be affected by the occurrence of riots or temporary difficulties.
