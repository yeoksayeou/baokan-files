Xinhua News Agency, Khartoum, July 11th.

Tens of thousands of Sudanese people held a rally today to express their support for the new military government that came to power through a recent coup.

The Chairman of the Sudanese Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation and Prime Minister, Omar al-Bashir, attended the rally. He stated at the rally that the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation would not allow the restoration of a multi-party political system or sectarianism.

He said that the revolution would bring peace to the Sudanese people. However, the path to peace is arduous and long, requiring the serious efforts of all Sudanese people. He also called on the Sudanese people to work hard for production and national reconciliation.

According to another report, the new Sudanese government has sent a four-person delegation to Ethiopia to prepare for contact with the leaders of the Sudan People's Liberation Army, which opposes the government. The Ethiopian leader has expressed a willingness to cooperate with the new Sudanese government to mediate internal conflicts in Sudan and end the civil war.
