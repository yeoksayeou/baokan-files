The trade volume between the Soviet Union and South Korea reached 2.6 billion US dollars last year. In the first half of this year, the transaction volume has already exceeded 3.4 billion US dollars.

The report states that South Korean businessmen have been visiting frequently. In addition to hoping to expand trade, they are also interested in joint ventures in the fields of chemicals, electronics, and automobile manufacturing. The Soviet Union's plan for a "free economic zone" in the Far East has attracted their attention.

    苏同南朝鲜发展经贸关系
    据塔斯社报道，去年苏联同南朝鲜贸易额为2.6亿美元，今年上半年成交额已逾3.4亿美元。
    报道说，南朝鲜商人频频来访，他们除希望扩大贸易外，还对在化工、电子、汽车制造领域的合资企业感兴趣。苏联远东的“自由经济区”计划引起他们的重视。
