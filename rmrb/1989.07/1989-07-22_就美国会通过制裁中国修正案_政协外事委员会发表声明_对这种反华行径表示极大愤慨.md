Statement by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference on the U.S. Congress Passing a Bill to Sanction China

(1989-07-22)

The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill to sanction China on June 29, 1989, and the U.S. Senate followed suit on July 14. These bills distort the facts, maliciously slander and attack the just stance and necessary measures taken by the Chinese government in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. We express our extreme indignation at the U.S. Congress's disregard for China's sovereignty and the will of its people, its blatant interference in China's internal affairs, and its serious harm to the feelings of the Chinese people.

China is a socialist country under the people's democratic dictatorship. The Chinese government attaches great importance to the interests and demands of the people and pays attention to listening to the people's opinions through various channels, including political consultative conferences. It welcomes criticism of the government's work by the people and accepts the people's supervision. However, the Chinese government and people will not tolerate counter-revolutionary subversive activities. In recent times, the turmoil that occurred in Beijing and some other places was not a general student movement or a "democratic movement." This turmoil later developed into a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, further proving that it was a planned, organized, and premeditated activity by a small number of people in collusion with certain hostile forces abroad, using the student movement to launch a campaign. The aim was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. The methods used were cruel, barbaric, and shocking. The Chinese government took necessary measures against the serious crimes of a small number of rioters that violated the Constitution and criminal law of the People's Republic of China. This was to restore social order and stability, ensure the safety of the state and the people, and enable economic construction and reform and opening up to proceed smoothly. Now, due to the decisive and correct measures taken by the Chinese government, the situation in China has tended to stabilize, and social order is gradually returning to normal. China will continue to protect the interests and legal rights of the broad masses of the people in accordance with its constitution and laws, and punish those who commit crimes, especially those who engage in violent and terrorist activities. Practice has proven that this approach is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and has won the firm support and approval of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, including various democratic parties, non-partisan patriots, people's organizations, and people of all ethnic groups and walks of life. The U.S. Congress, however, meddles in this purely internal affair of China, making unjustified accusations and interference, glorifying the counter-revolutionary rebellion as a "democratic movement," and slandering the Chinese government's lawful punishment of criminal elements as "suppressing peaceful demonstrations." This is obviously a case of black and white reversal, which the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and all patriots cannot accept.

The Chinese government has always advocated that in international exchanges, countries should handle relations between them on the basis of the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. We do not interfere in the internal affairs of any country, and we will not allow any country to interfere in our internal affairs. The Chinese people have their own system and values, and we do not impose them on other countries. Some people in the United States should not try to impose their system and values on us. The Chinese people will never yield to any external pressure. Some people in the U.S. Congress, under the banner of "democracy, freedom, and human rights," have repeatedly blatantly interfered in China's internal affairs and passed a bill to sanction China, attempting to pressure the Chinese government to change its policies. This is futile and doomed to fail. The actions of the U.S. Congress not only violate internationally recognized norms but also damage the friendly relations between China and the United States that have been cultivated over many years, ultimately harming the interests of the United States itself. We warn those in the U.S. Congress to immediately stop all activities that interfere in China's internal affairs, hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people, and damage relations between the two countries.

China's policy of reform and opening up will not change, nor will its independent and peaceful foreign policy. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will, as always, support the Chinese government in further developing economic and cultural exchanges with foreign countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, actively carry out people's diplomacy, develop relations and cooperation with all friendly countries and organizations, and jointly maintain world peace. At the same time, it will, as always, resolutely fight against all reactionary forces that are hostile to China and interfere in China's internal affairs, and safeguard the sovereignty, independence, and dignity of the country.

    就美国会通过制裁中国修正案
    政协外事委员会发表声明
    对这种反华行径表示极大愤慨
    新华社北京7月22日电　中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会外事委员会关于美国国会通过制裁中国的修正案的声明
      （一九八九年七月二十二日）
    美国国会众议院1989年6月29日和美国国会参议院7月14日先后通过制裁中国的修正案，歪曲事实真相，对中国政府在制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱中所采取的正义立场和必要措施，肆意进行污蔑和攻击，并提出一系列对中国的制裁措施。我们对美国国会无视中国国家主权和人民意愿，粗暴干涉中国内政和严重伤害中国人民感情的反华行径，表示极大的愤慨。
    中国是实行人民民主专政的社会主义国家。中国政府十分重视人民的利益和要求，注意通过各种途径包括政治协商会议的形式听取人民意见，欢迎人民对政府工作的批评和接受人民的监督。但是中国政府和人民绝不容忍反革命颠覆活动。最近以来，在中国首都北京和其它一些地方发生的动乱，绝不是一般的学潮和什么“民主运动”，这个动乱后来在北京发展为反革命暴乱，进一步说明这是极少数人勾结国外某些敌对势力利用学潮掀起的一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的活动，其目的是企图推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国，其手段是残酷野蛮、骇人听闻的。中国政府对极少数暴乱分子这种违反中华人民共和国宪法和刑法的严重罪行，采取了一个主权国家所应采取的措施，这是为了恢复社会秩序的稳定，保障国家和人民的安全，使经济建设和改革开放得以顺利进行。现在，由于中国政府采取了果断正确的措施，中国的局势已经趋于稳定，社会秩序逐步恢复正常。中国将继续按照自己的宪法和法律，保护广大人民的利益和合法权利，惩处触犯刑律特别是那些进行暴力和恐怖活动的犯罪分子。实践证明，这种做法是符合中国各族人民的愿望和根本利益的，从而得到中国各族人民包括各民主党派、无党派爱国人士、各人民团体、各族各界人士的坚决支持和拥护。美国国会对于这一纯属中国内政的事务却指手划脚，横加干涉和指责，把反革命暴乱美化为“民主运动”，把中国政府依法惩处罪犯分子污蔑成“镇压和平示威”，这显然是颠倒黑白，中国各族人民和一切爱国人士是绝对不能接受的。
    我国政府历来主张，在国际交往中，应当本着互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则来处理国与国之间的关系。我们不干涉任何国家的内政，也绝不允许任何国家干涉我国的内政。中国人民有自己的制度和价值观念，我们不把它强加于别的国家，美国一些人也休想把他们的制度和价值观念强加给我们。中国人民永远不会屈服于任何外来压力。美国国会有些人打着“民主、自由、人权”的旗号，一再粗暴干涉中国的内政问题，并通过对中国采取制裁措施的修正案，企图向中国施加压力，迫使中国政府改变政策，这完全是徒劳的，是注定要失败的。美国国会的这种做法，不仅违背了公认的国际准则，而且损害了经过多年培养起来的中美之间的友好关系，最终也将损害美国自身的利益。我们正告美国国会的一些人，立即停止一切干涉中国内政，伤害中国人民民族感情，损害两国关系的活动。
    中国的改革开放政策不会改变，中国独立自主的和平外交政策也不会改变。中国人民政治协商会议将一如既往地支持我国政府按照和平共处五项原则进一步发展同外国的经济、文化交流的方针，积极开展人民外交，发展同一切友好国家、友好组织的联系和合作，共同维护世界和平；同时，也将一如既往地同一切敌视中国，干涉中国内政的反动势力进行坚决的斗争，维护自己国家的主权、独立和尊严。
