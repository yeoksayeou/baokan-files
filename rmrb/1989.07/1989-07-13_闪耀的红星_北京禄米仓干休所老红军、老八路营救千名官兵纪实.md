At around 9 AM on June 3rd, the usually tranquil Beijing Military Region Lugumicang Retirement Home suddenly became bustling.

"Martial law troops have come to our place!"

"Soldiers have come, our children have come!"

For many days, the worried elderly residents, upon hearing this news, hurriedly rushed out of their homes.

They saw these unarmed soldiers, who had marched on foot from Tongxian County in the outskirts of Beijing into the city, being obstructed and dispersed at the Jian guomen Interchange. Exhausted, they had collapsed in a heap. In an instant, more than a thousand soldiers had entered the courtyard of less than 2,000 square meters, while a pursuing crowd of rioters and uninformed people were shouting and screaming at the gate...

At that time, the young assistant staff member Zōu Qún hurriedly found the 75-year-old Red Army veteran Fàn Fùshān. This former director of the Railway Engineering Corps Logistics Department, who had led thousands of troops, looked at the soldiers who had been dispersed and beaten by the rioters and were now lying on the ground, his heart aching: "These are our soldiers, if we don't take care of them, who will? Everyone, start boiling water!"

Within an hour, every household had brought out bowls of rice porridge, tea, noodles, and other food.

Soldiers from seven different units gathered together, causing some chaos. After observing this, Fàn Fùshān and young Zōu found the "highest commander" at the time—the three battalion commanders, political commissars, and chief of staff from different units, and issued a decisive order: "Your ranks are the highest, let's form a temporary organization, and these soldiers will be under your responsibility!" He then gestured to divide the troops into areas.

At this moment, Deputy Director Lǐ Hèzhōng, who had been out on business, rushed back breathlessly. He immediately organized people to clear out two offices. A temporary command center composed of old cadres, staff, and military leaders was established, and the disorganized troops regained their formation.

People had arrived, and they needed to eat and sleep. But where could a thousand people sleep? Just as they were worrying, the former commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, Cài Yīng, who was famous for his love for soldiers on the 8,000-mile border in the north, suggested: "The soldiers are the most important, let's clear out the garages!" Soon, more than a dozen garages and some rooms and corridors were cleared out.

"Child, lay this down! Don't catch a cold!" Old Eighth Route Army soldier Liú Shuǐshēng was hospitalized, and over the phone, he told his wife Zhāng Bīn to bring the thousand-yuan pure wool patterned rug from their living room to lay down for the soldiers. Some elderly people also brought quilts and coats.

Night fell. With the help of these old leaders, the extremely fatigued soldiers finally made contact with their superiors and were ordered to reach the designated assembly point by 10 PM.

Military orders are absolute. The soldiers immediately became spirited and prepared to set out. However, the situation outside was becoming increasingly tense. The vicious rioters not only blocked military vehicles and attacked soldiers but had also started burning cars and killing people. How could they get out in such a situation?

It was still Fàn Fùshān who, despite his old age and weakness, pushed open the door of the temporary command center and, together with everyone, analyzed the situation, clarified the route, and studied the action plan. The over-40-year-old Lǐ Hèzhōng volunteered: "I am familiar with Beijing, I will be the guide!"

As soon as the soldiers went out, they were attacked and besieged by a group of rioters before reaching the Beijing Station entrance.

The sight of fresh blood immediately aroused people's hatred towards the rioters and concern for the soldiers. Everyone quickly brought the unconscious injured back for rescue. The model medical worker Móu Zhuàngshàn, who had rescued many comrades in battles such as Menglianggu, told the director of the medical office Liú Jīnhuá: "We need to classify and rescue, prioritizing the severely injured." Obviously, he had become the "field commander" again. Then, he and a medical orderly classified and numbered the injured.

Many old Red Army and Eighth Route Army soldiers, though they couldn't bandage wounds, refused to leave. Some shone flashlights and handed out towels, while others washed away the blood, reminding the medical orderlies: "Gently, gently, there are wounds here too."

22 severely injured soldiers urgently needed to be transferred to another hospital. By this time, it was already midnight, and the heartless rioters on the streets were very arrogant. If they went out now, their lives would be in danger. But the young soldiers were bleeding...

"Without an ambulance, what do we do?" "Use the van! Even if the car is burned or smashed, the injured must be sent to the hospital on time!" Wú, the assistant director, made a decisive order.

The "van ambulance" set out. According to the old leaders' arrangements, the medical personnel on the car wore white coats, dressed as doctors. To avoid the crowd, they turned off the car lights, took the back roads, ran red lights, and sped up. But later, they were still discovered by the rioters. Facing the stones thrown at them, they used their bodies to block the car windows, protecting the injured... After three round trips, they finally sent the 22 severely injured soldiers to the hospital.

Soon, some of the besieged and dispersed soldiers returned to the Lugumicang Retirement Home. Under the careful care of the old leaders and staff here, they safely spent 5 days and 4 nights...

    闪耀的红星
    ——北京禄米仓干休所老红军、老八路营救千名官兵纪实
    包国俊　李化民　宋玉仓
    6月3日上午9时许。平静的北京军区禄米仓干休所突然沸腾了。
    “戒严部队来咱们院儿了！”
    “战士们来了，孩子们来了！”
    多少天来，忧心忡忡的老人们，听到这一消息，纷纷涌出了家门。
    只见，这些赤手空拳的官兵们，徒步从京郊通县开进市区，在建国门立交桥受阻而被冲散，累得精疲力尽。一时间，不足2000平方米的院落，进来了1000多名官兵，尾追的一群暴徒和不明真相的人们，在大门口狂呼乱叫……
    当时在家的年轻助理员邹群，急忙找到75岁的红军老战士范富山。这个曾任铁道兵后勤部长，率领过千军万马的老人，望着眼前被暴徒冲散、殴打而倒卧一片的士兵们，心情一阵阵难受：“这是咱们战士，咱们不管谁管？现在家家烧水！”
    不到一个小时，家家都端来了米粥、茶水、挂面等食物。
    由7个单位汇集而来的官兵，聚在一起，不免有些乱。范富山看出这一情况后，同小邹找到当时的“最高指挥员”——三位不同单位的团长、政委和参谋长，斩钉截铁地下令：“你们职务最高，咱们组成一个临时组织，这些兵全归你们负责！”并挥手给部队划分了区域。
    此刻，外出办事的副所长李贺忠同志气喘喘地赶回来了。他立即带人，腾出了两间办公室。一个由老干部、工作人员和部队领导组成的临时指挥所成立了，纷乱无绪的部队恢复了建制。
    人来了，就得吃住。可是上千号人往哪睡？正当发愁的时候，曾在北疆八千里边防线上以爱兵如子而著称的原内蒙古军区司令员蔡英挤过来献策：“还是战士们要紧，把车库腾出来！”很快十几个轿车库和一些房屋、楼道都腾出来。
    “孩子，铺上这个吧！不要凉着！”老八路刘水生病住院，电话里他让老伴张彬妈妈，把自家客厅里那块价值千元的纯毛花色地毯拿来给战士们铺。一些老人还送来被子、大衣。
    夜，拉下了帷幕。极度疲劳的官兵们，在这些老首长们的帮助下，终于和上级取得了联系，定于晚上10点钟之前赶到指定集结地。
    军令如山。指战员立刻振奋起来，准备出发。可是，外面的局势日趋严峻，穷凶极恶的暴徒们，不仅拦阻军车，围攻官兵，而且已经开始烧车、杀人了。在这种情况下怎么出去？
    还是那位范富山老同志，不顾自己年老体弱，推开了临时指挥所的门，和大家一起分析形势，查明路线，研究行动方案。年过40的李贺忠，主动提出：“我熟悉北京情况，我去当向导！”
    指战员们刚出去，还未到北京站口，就遭到一群暴徒的围攻和袭击。
    鲜红的血迹，立刻激起了人们对暴徒的愤恨和对战士的关切之情。大家迅速把昏迷不醒的伤员扶回来抢救。曾在孟良崮等战役中抢救过许多战友的模范医务工作者牟壮善对医务室主任刘金华说：“现在要分类抢救，先重后轻。”很显然，他又成了“阵地指挥员”。接着，他又同一个卫生员给伤员们分类编号。
    许多老红军、老八路，虽不会包扎伤口，却不肯离去，有的打手电、递毛巾，有的洗血迹，不时地提醒卫生员们：“轻点，轻点，这也有伤口。”
    22名重伤员急需转院。这时，已是午夜时分了，大街上丧心病狂的暴徒们，十分嚣张。如果这时出去，则有生命危险。但年轻的战士在流血……
    “没有救护车，怎么办？”“动面包车！就是把车烧了、砸了也要把伤员及时送到总院！”吴协理员果断地下了命令。
    “面包救护车”出发了，根据老首长的安排，车上救护人员穿上白大褂，一身医生打扮。为了避开人群，他们关掉车灯，走小道，闯红灯，加速行驶。但后来还是被暴徒发觉了。面对投掷而来的石块，他们就用身子挡住车窗，护着伤员……三次往返，终于把22名重伤员送到医院。
    不久，部分被围困和冲散的官兵们，又陆续回到了禄米仓干休所。在这里的老首长和工作人员的精心照料下，他们安然度过了5天4夜……
