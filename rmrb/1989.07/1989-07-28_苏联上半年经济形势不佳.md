Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, July 27th.

The execution of the Soviet Union's national economic plan for the first half of this year was far from satisfactory compared to the same period last year. Several key economic indicators failed to meet the planned targets, indicating a difficult economic situation.

This was announced by the First Deputy Chairman of the Soviet State Statistics Committee, Belov, at a press conference on the 27th. He said that compared to the first half of last year, the growth rates of the gross national product, national income, industrial output, social labor productivity, and consumer goods production were 3.3%, 2.5%, 2.7%, 2.8%, and 5.6% respectively, all of which were significantly lower than the annual plan.

Belov mentioned that there have been some positive changes in the structure of the national economy. The growth rate of the machinery manufacturing industry in the first half of the year was 4.3%, higher than the overall growth rate of industrial output. The output value of consumer goods industry increased by 5.3%, nearly three times the growth rate of production materials. However, the growth rate of consumer goods is still far below the planned target of 10%.

He also revealed that the inflation rate in the Soviet Union for the first half of this year was 2.2%.

    苏联上半年经济形势不佳
    新华社莫斯科7月27日电  今年上半年苏联国民经济计划执行结果远不如去年同期，一些主要的国民经济指标均未完成计划，苏联经济处境困难。
    这是苏联国家统计委员会第一副主席别洛夫27日在新闻发布会上宣布的。他说，与去年上半年相比，国民生产总值、国民收入、工业产值、社会劳动生产率和消费品生产的增长率分别为3.3％、2.5％、2.7％、2.8％和5.6％，均大大低于年度计划。
    别洛夫说，国民经济结构有一些积极变化。上半年机器制造业的增长率为4.3％，高于整个工业产值的增长率，消费品工业产值增长5.3％，几乎是生产资料生产增长率的3倍。但是，消费品增长速度仍远远低于10％的计划指标。
    他还透露，今年上半年苏联的通货膨胀率为2.2％。
