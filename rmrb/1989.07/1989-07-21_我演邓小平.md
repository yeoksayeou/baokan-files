In May 1988, the two deputy directors of the film "Baise Uprising" came to Sichuan to select actors. They visited the Sichuan People's Art Theatre, where I work, and found a photograph of me playing Sun Yat-sen in the play "Sun Yat-sen and Song Qingling." They believed that in terms of physical appearance, I had the potential to play Deng Xiaoping.

In late June, I received a notice to go to the film set for makeup tests, rehearsals, and video recording. I am very grateful to makeup artist Yang Shudong, whose skills made me look more like Deng Xiaoping, which boosted my confidence. Among several candidates, I was the lucky one. Finally, Vice Chairman Wang Zhen, after reviewing the character's makeup and video, said, "This Deng Xiaoping looks like the real one." The decision was made, and I finally got my wish.

As an actor, being able to play a contemporary figure of global significance on screen is truly fortunate.

I am fully aware that playing a familiar leader requires more than just physical resemblance; the most important thing is to capture the essence of the character. In addition to physical training, I focused on understanding the character from within. I repeatedly read "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping" to analyze his thoughts, personality, problem-solving methods, and work style. I also reviewed his biographies to understand his lifestyle, interests, hardships, and interpersonal relationships. Additionally, I flipped through his photo albums and watched some of his videos to sense his inner state from his external appearance. Through these preparations, I realized that Deng Xiaoping is a person who values practicality and pragmatism, deals with specific issues on a case-by-case basis, adapts to changing circumstances, and dares to take responsibility. He is resolute, quick-witted, and decisive. On major issues, he never makes the slightest compromise; in dealing with people, he is approachable and friendly. Throughout his life, he has been full of confidence, never feeling inferior, even in times of setbacks. He is flexible and alert, not just someone who executes orders without understanding, but someone who can seize opportunities and maintain a calm and clear mind. He has a broad vision and a broad mind; he is both a serious person and a humorous person. These are his unique characteristics. At the same time, I realized that these excellent qualities are not innate but were formed and forged through long-term study of Marxism-Leninism and long-term revolutionary struggle and practice.

In my preparatory work, in addition to writing a character biography, I also made more than ten thousand words of notes and character-building ideas. I constantly pondered each scene in the script, understanding which scenes could best showcase Deng Xiaoping's thoughts, personality traits, and other aspects, ensuring I had a clear understanding.

During the filming process, in addition to capturing the character's inner thoughts, I also practiced a series of external actions. I practiced smoking (I didn't smoke before), shuffling cards, and riding a horse. These training sessions all had the desired effect.

The film is finished, and I truly feel a sense of relief and happiness after all the hard work. Will the Deng Xiaoping I portrayed be recognized? Let the audience decide. My performance has parts that make me happy, excited, and thrilled, but also parts that make me feel regretful and disappointed. Perhaps this is the "art of regret." "Cinema is the director's art." In this sense, my first time playing Deng Xiaoping, I encountered a director who is bold, daring, and talented, which is truly fortunate. I believe the entire film is meticulously made.

    我演邓小平
    卢奇
    1988年5月，《百色起义》的两位副导演到四川挑演员，来到我所在的四川人民艺术剧院，在查阅艺术档案时，发现了我在《孙中山与宋庆龄》中扮演孙中山的一张剧照，他们认为在外型特征中我具备扮演邓小平的条件。
    6月下旬，我接到通知，赶到摄制组试妆、试戏、录像。我非常感谢化妆师杨树栋老师，他的妙法使我在外型上更接近邓小平，这使我树立了自信心。在好几个候选人中，我成了幸运者，最后，王震副主席在审查人物造型的录像时说：“这个邓小平像。”大局已定，我终于如愿以偿。
    作为一个演员，能在银幕上扮演当今在世界上有着重大影响的人物，真是再幸运不过了。
    我清醒地认识到，扮演人们熟悉的领袖人物，光有外形条件，是远远不够的，最重要的还是在神似。于是我除了在外形方面进行一些训练外，主要从内心去把握角色。我又反复阅读《邓小平文选》，从他的讲话里分析他的思想性格，处理事物的方法，工作作风；反复查看有关他的传记，从中了解他的生活习性，兴趣爱好，坎坷经历，为人处事；同时还反复翻阅他的画册，观看他的一些录像，从他的外部形体中，体味他当时的内心状态等。通过这些准备我认识到，邓小平在思想作风方面，是一个最讲究实事求是的人，具体问题具体对待，随机应变敢作敢为，敢于承担责任。他意志坚强，反应敏锐，行动果断。在重大问题上，从来不会作出半点让步；在待人接物上，又是那样随和亲切。他一生都充满自信，没有丝毫自愧不如的感觉，即使在失意的时候，自信心也不会消失。他灵活机警，不是只知道执行上级命令不懂得变通的人，而是善于把握时机，能经常保持冷静清醒的头脑。他目光远大，胸怀广阔，他既是一个严肃的人，又是一个幽默的人，这些就是他独有的个性。同时我还认识到他这些优秀的品质，不是先天就有的，而是在长期学习马列主义的过程中，在长期革命斗争生活的实践中，不断地形成铸造起来的。
    我在案头准备工作中，除了撰写人物自传外，还作了上万字的资料记录及人物塑造设想。我不断捉摸剧本中的每一场戏，哪场戏能体现邓小平的思想品质、性格特征的哪一方面，都要做到心中有数。
    在拍摄过程中，我除了把握人物内心活动外，还进行了一系列外部动作的练习。我练习抽烟（我以前不会抽烟），练习洗牌，练习骑马，这些训练都收到了预期的效果。
    片子拍完了，我这时真感到经过艰辛而终于获得的一种轻松感、幸福感。我扮演的邓小平会得到认可吗？留给观众来评定吧。自己的表演，有使我高兴、激动、兴奋的地方，也有使我感到遗憾、沮丧的不足之处，这也许是“遗憾的艺术”的规律吧。“电影的艺术是导演的艺术”。从这个意义上讲，我第一次扮演邓小平，就遇上了一个有魄力、有胆识、有才能的好导演，真是幸运。我认为整部片子拍得是严谨的。
