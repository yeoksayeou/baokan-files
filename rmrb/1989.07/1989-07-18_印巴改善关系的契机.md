Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi recently paid a one-day visit to Pakistan. Although no substantial results were achieved, both sides emphasized in a joint statement that the two countries would strive to resolve the Siachen dispute "on the premise of withdrawing troops to avoid military conflicts." However, commentators here still refer to this visit as a "good opportunity for India and Pakistan to improve relations," with some even using terms like "breakthrough" and "turning point." This is because Rajiv Gandhi's visit is the first step towards "official mutual visits" between the leaders of India and Pakistan this year; it is the first time in 30 years that an Indian Prime Minister has officially visited Pakistan; and it is another important meeting between the new generation of leaders of the two major powers in South Asia.

Since Benazir Bhutto came to power, especially during the fourth South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) summit, Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi have expressed their desire to improve bilateral relations and have taken some concrete actions. After the two Prime Ministers signed the "No Attack on Each Other's Nuclear Facilities," "Avoiding Double Taxation on Bilateral Trade," and "Strengthening Cultural Exchanges Between the Two Countries" agreements, the two countries have held multiple rounds of talks at the secretary level in the fields of diplomacy, internal affairs, and defense. Progress has been made on the Siachen dispute, and a comprehensive resolution is expected. The two countries have begun cooperation in combating drug trafficking and terrorism, and there has been progress in cooperation and exchanges in industry, agriculture, technology, and especially in civilian trade.

Rajiv Gandhi faces elections this year, and the Indian National Congress's policy towards Pakistan will be a point of contention. Local opinion believes that India has a large number of Muslim voters, whose votes are crucial to Rajiv Gandhi, and their attitudes depend on Rajiv Gandhi's policy towards Pakistan. This year, India has had disputes of varying degrees with its northern neighbor Nepal and its southern neighbor Sri Lanka, which undoubtedly harms the Indian government's international and domestic image. These countries are members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and have good relations with Pakistan, while Benazir Bhutto is the current chairman of the alliance and can play a mediating role. Rajiv Gandhi taking the initiative and making the first step towards "official mutual visits" between the governments of India and Pakistan is a wise move.

Since Benazir Bhutto formed the People's Party government, she has consistently regarded relations with India as an important part of her foreign policy. The Benazir Bhutto government has taken some proactive measures to improve relations between India and Pakistan. It is estimated that Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi will have some important opportunities to meet this year. As a return visit, Benazir Bhutto may officially visit India next month; the Non-Aligned Movement summit in September, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October, and the fifth SAARC summit to be held in Colombo at the end of the year will all provide opportunities for Benazir Bhutto and Rajiv Gandhi to meet again. In addition, as the chairman, Benazir Bhutto will visit the other six South Asian countries in the near future to prepare for the summit. It seems that these two young government leaders will have ample time and opportunities to discuss bilateral relations and make progress.

Of course, due to historical and geographical factors, India and Pakistan have deep-seated conflicts in terms of territory, ethnicity, and religion, and there are differences in the Kashmir issue, regional nuclear non-proliferation, halting the arms race, and the Afghanistan issue. However, improving relations between India and Pakistan is in line with the trend of the times, in line with the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries and even the peoples of the South Asian countries, and is conducive to the economic development of these two populous countries. People hope that during the tenure of these two new generation leaders, relations between India and Pakistan will see substantial improvement.

    印巴改善关系的契机
    本报记者  任毓骏
    印度总理拉吉夫·甘地日前对巴基斯坦进行了为期一天的访问，尽管双方没有取得实质性成果，只在联合公报中强调两国将在“后撤军队以避免军事冲突的前提下”努力实现“全面解决锡亚琴争端问题”，此间评论界人士仍把这次访问称之为“印巴改善关系的良好契机”，有的还使用了“突破”和“转折点”等词。这是因为拉·甘地此行是印巴领导人年内实现“正式互访”的第一步；是30年来第一位印度总理正式访问巴基斯坦；是南亚两个大国的新一代领导人又一次重要会晤。
    自贝·布托上台执政，特别是第四届南亚国家首脑会议期间，贝·布托和拉·甘地首次会晤以来，两国领导人都表示改善双边关系的良好愿望并采取了一些具体行动。继两国总理签署了《互不攻击对方核设施》、《避免两国贸易双重征税》和《两国加强文化交流》等3个协议之后，两国外交、内政和国防等部的秘书级会谈又举行多次，在锡亚琴争端问题上已取得进展并可望得到全面解决。两国在反毒品走私和反恐怖活动方面已开始合作，在工业、农业、科技特别是民间贸易方面的合作和交流也有进展。
    拉·甘地今年面临大选，国大党的对巴政策将是一个争论焦点。此间舆论认为，印度有大量的穆斯林选民，他们的选票对拉·甘地至关重要，而这些选民的态度又取决于拉·甘地的对巴政策。今年以来，印度和北邻尼泊尔，南邻斯里兰卡都发生不同程度的纠纷，这无疑有损印度政府的国际、国内形象。这些国家都是南亚区域合作联盟成员，和巴基斯坦都有良好的关系，而贝·布托又是本届联盟执行主席，能起斡旋作用。拉·甘地采取主动，迈出实现印巴政府领导人“正式互访”的第一步是明智的。
    贝·布托组建人民党政府以来，一直把对印关系作为外交政策的重要部分。贝·布托政府已在改善印巴关系方面采取了一些主动行动。据估计，年内贝·布托和拉·甘地还将有一些重要的会晤机会。作为回访，贝·布托可能下月正式访问印度；9月的不结盟国家首脑会议，10月的英联邦成员国会议，以及年底在科伦坡举行的第五届南亚区域合作联盟首脑会议，都将为贝·布托和拉·甘地提供再次会晤的机会。此外，作为执行主席，贝·布托将在近期遍访南亚其他六国，为首脑会议作准备。如此看来，这两位年轻的政府领导人将有充分的时间和机会讨论双边关系问题并取得进展。
    当然，由于历史和地域等方面的因素，印巴两国在领土、种族和宗教等方面的矛盾较深，在克什米尔问题、地区限制核扩散、停止军备竞赛和阿富汗问题等方面也存在分歧。但是，改善印巴关系符合时代潮流，符合两国人民乃至南亚各国人民的根本利益，有助于这两个人口众多的国家的经济发展，人们希望看到，在两位新一代领导人执政期间，印巴关系能得到实质性的改善。　　　　　（本报伊斯兰堡7月18日电）
