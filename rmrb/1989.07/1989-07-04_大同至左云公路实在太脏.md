The road from Datong to Zuoyun is a crucial route to the Yungang Grottoes and is also an important highway for transporting coal from Shanxi to other regions. Currently, the road is covered with a thick layer of dust. On clear days, the dust flies as cars pass by, forcing people to cover their noses as they walk by. On rainy days, the road becomes muddy, making it difficult to travel. It is currently the peak tourist season, with many domestic and foreign tourists visiting. We hope that the environmental sanitation department of Datong City will strengthen management and clean up this important road.

    大同至左云公路实在太脏
    大同市同左公路是通往云岗石窟的必经地，同时也是晋煤外运的一条重要公路线。现在这条公路两旁尘土已堆积很厚，晴天汽车来往，尘土飞扬，人们掩鼻而过；雨天道路泥泞，行走困难。目前正是旅游旺季，中外游人甚多，我们希望大同市环卫部门加强管理，清扫这条重要的公路。
