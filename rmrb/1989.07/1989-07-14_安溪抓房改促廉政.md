Certain officials are using their authority to occupy multiple housing units, which is one of the most discontented corruption issues among the masses. Anxi County in Fujian Province has taken this issue head-on, focusing on clean governance.

Housing in Anxi County's government offices has always been tight, with over 500 households of cadres and workers not receiving housing allocations. However, some leading cadres, relying on their power, have occupied multiple housing units. The county party committee and government decided to start with housing reform to promote clean governance. They introduced two public disclosures and one supervision into the housing reform, using methods such as individual filling of forms, collective review, public posting, and public evaluation to assess housing purchase conditions and prevent the use of power for personal gain. For old housing residents, they re-issued public notices, and those exceeding the standard were firmly required to vacate.
