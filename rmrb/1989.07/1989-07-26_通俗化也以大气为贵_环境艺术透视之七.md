	"One must have a mass perspective!"—this is what designers and artists seeking innovation today fear the most. In reality, what is frightening is the misinterpretation of "popularization."

	In the design of new or renovated environmental art systems, the most likely place to "fail" is in grasping the overall cultural atmosphere of the environment. In different temporal and spatial conditions, elegance, popular appeal, or "a blend of the elegant and the popular" can all achieve success. Especially in today's trend of resisting rationalism and embracing "postmodernism," art expressions rich in national style, local color, and rural flavor are highly favored.

	However, looking at the current situation, whether it is indoor or outdoor spaces, the popularization of environmental art often loses its cultural character due to a "petty" style. Why is this so? The root of the problem lies in "piling up"! Now that money is more abundant, piling up has become more convenient, and the trend of "one-upmanship" makes piling up more rampant. Even the simplest and most straightforward elements in urban landscapes, such as residential balconies, pedestrian railings, street flower beds, traffic booths, park benches, streetlights, advertisements, signs, trash cans, etc., all have to be tediously "popularized" in terms of shape. Last year, dragon statues appeared everywhere, regardless of the occasion, always wanting people to admire their majesty and not rest.

	The result of piling up is inevitably meanness, vulgarity, and pettiness, inevitably destroying the overall harmony of the environment. In fact, whether the artistic expression is "elegant" or "popular," the goal is to make people's souls experience the highest ideals of the new era and new life. Designers and artists should view this as the overall meaning of environmental art creation.

	Information aesthetics tells us that the appreciation of environmental art includes two aspects: one is the appreciation of external information encoding—integrating environmental art images into one's inner imagination; the other is the output of information decoding—imbuing one's inner experiences and emotional meanings into environmental art images. What is meant by "popularization" is to make the information conveyed by the artwork accessible to the masses, allowing them to complete the encoding and decoding process without obstruction or interruption. Therefore, the famous postmodern architect and theorist Robert Venturi advocates making works have "dual decoding"—decoding by the masses and decoding by experts.

	Unlike the pursuit of elegance, popularization must consider the cultural psychology and aesthetic tastes of the masses. However, popularization is not "verbosity" and is not "talking nonsense." Popularization in environmental art expressions must shed its lowbrow cultural tone to truly have a soul-enlightening and character-nurturing effect, to win the joy of the masses while also making the "scholars and connoisseurs" among the masses delighted. It is clear that popularization in art expression also requires innovation and arduous craftsmanship.

	The principle of concise and precise design is not only applicable to elegant styles but is also highly instructive for popular art expressions. Some compare the specific use of design techniques to doing addition and subtraction. In today's environmental art creation, grandeur and conciseness are not contradictory. Only by being good at "subtraction" can the cultural tone of popular art expressions be elevated. Concise and precise design not only maintains a relaxed and grand artistic character but also facilitates the implementation and production of the environmental art system, and is beneficial for maintenance and management after completion. In this sense, the creativity of popular art expressions also aligns the social and economic benefits of environmental art aesthetics. It is easy to understand that in the exploration of popular art expressions, there is also a need to face the arduous task of gradually transforming and improving the cultural psychology of the masses.

### 通俗化也以大气为贵——环境艺术透视之七

    通俗化也以大气为贵
    ——环境艺术透视之七
    布正伟
    “要有群众观点！”——这是当今渴求创新的设计师与艺术家们最怕挨的当头棒。其实，可怕的只是对“通俗化”的曲解。
    在新建或改建的环境艺术系统工程设计中，最容易“砸锅”的地方就是对整体环境文化气质的把握。在不同的时空条件下，高雅、通俗或“雅俗共赏”均可以取得成功，特别是在当今抵制理性主义、时兴“后现代”的浪潮中，富于民族风韵、地方色彩和乡土情调的通俗化艺术表现颇得青睐。
    然而，从当前的实际情况来看，不论是室内空间还是室外空间，环境艺术的通俗化表现，往往因“小家子气”的作派而有失其文化品格。何以如此？堆砌乃是一大顽症！现在钱多了，堆砌起来更加方便，而“攀比”之风又使堆砌越演越烈。即使是城市景观中最为简单明了的构成元素，诸如住宅阳台、人行道栏杆、街心花坛、交通岗亭、公园座椅、路灯、广告、标志、污物筒等等，也都要不厌其烦地在“造型通俗化”上折腾一番。去年，张牙舞爪的龙神到处出现，也不管是什么场合，都要让人领略它们的威风而不得消停。
    堆砌的结果必然是贫气、俗气、小气，必然是破坏整体环境的大关系。其实，艺术表现的“雅”也好，“俗”也好，其目的都在于使人们的心灵感受到新时代与新生活的最高旨趣。设计师和艺术家应视此为环境艺术创作的总体意蕴。
    信息论美学告诉我们，环境艺术的欣赏活动包括两个方面：一是欣赏者把外来的信息编码——即把环境艺术形象同化为自己内心的意象；二是欣赏者输出信息的译码——即把自己内心的经验和情感意味移入到环境艺术形象之中。所谓“通俗化”，就是要让艺术作品所传递的信息，能使大众可以自己完成这种编码与译码的程序而不致受阻和中断。所以著名的后现代建筑理论家和建筑师凡丘里
  （Rebert Venturi）竭力提倡要使作品具有“双重译码”——大众的译码和行家的译码。
    与对高雅风的追求不同，通俗化更要考虑到大众的文化心理与审美情趣。但通俗化决不是“啰嗦化”，决不是“耍贫嘴”。环境艺术表现中的通俗化只有摆脱低俗的文化格调，才能真正起到感化心灵、陶冶性情的作用，才能在博得大众欢欣的同时，也使大众中“文人雅士”赏心悦目。可见通俗化的艺术表现也需要创新，也需要艰苦的艺匠经营。
    简约精当的设计原则不仅适用于高雅之风，而且对通俗化的艺术表现也极有借鉴的必要。有人把设计手法的具体运用比喻成作加减法。在当今环境艺术创作中，大气与简炼是并不矛盾的。唯有善于作“减法”，才能使通俗化艺术表现的文化格调提高一筹。简约精当不仅可以保持舒展、大气的艺术品格，而且也有利于环境艺术系统的实施与制作，有利于建成后的维护与管理。从这个意义上来讲，通俗化艺术表现的创造性，也使环境艺术审美的社会效益与经济效益一致起来。不难理解，在通俗化艺术表现的探索中，也同样需要正视逐步改造和完善社会大众文化心理结构这一严峻任务。
