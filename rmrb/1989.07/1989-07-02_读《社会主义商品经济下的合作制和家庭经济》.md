Since the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in our country, the theoretical circle has been actively discussing and debating the economic relations and socialization trends in rural areas. As the rural reforms deepen, these discussions and studies continue to evolve. Under these historical conditions, Comrade Yang Chengxin, starting from the actual situation of China's rural reforms, summarized domestic and international historical experiences, studied the theory and practice of Marxist cooperative system, and compiled the book "Cooperative System and Family Economy Under Socialist Commodity Economy" (published by the Chinese Social Sciences Press in 1988). This book has made theoretical breakthroughs in China's rural economic reforms. It has important reference value for exploring the cooperative economy and modernization path with Chinese characteristics.

The theoretical breakthrough of this book is first reflected in the negation of the collective farming model based on product economy, revealing the intrinsic connection between cooperative system and commodity economy. The author studied the development of domestic cooperatives, objectively summarized the experiences and lessons of socialist countries, especially excavated Lenin's cooperative thoughts, and proposed that Marxist cooperative theory has a process of negation of negation. It is recognized that "the theory of socialist commodity economy is a key to understanding the cooperative system," and "there is a common element between commodity economy and cooperative system, that is, the socialization of production." From the history of cooperatives in various developed countries, it is a product of the development of commodity economy to a certain stage, and only by organizing cooperatives according to the requirements of commodity economy will it have strong vitality. Therefore, it is proposed that the driving force must be sought from the commodity economy, and various forms of cooperative organizations should be established to adapt to the characteristics of commodity economy. The book further analyzes the characteristics of the development of rural commodity economy in our country and predicts that there will be several development stages, all of which may have a significant impact on the development of rural cooperative economy.

Another breakthrough of this book is in the discussion of family economy under socialist commodity economy. The author analyzes historical facts and believes that family economy has an inseparable relationship with the characteristics of agricultural production. It "is indeed a highly adaptable social economic cell that can relatively adapt to the complex and contradictory requirements of agricultural production activities in various eras. Before the industrial production of artificial protein replaces agriculture, the existence of family economy is a necessary phenomenon." The author boldly negates the theory of eliminating peasant family economy in socialism and affirms the vitality of the new family economy. The reason why socialist agriculture should negate and utilize this ancient form is that it has multi-faceted adaptability, various flexibilities, and the comprehensiveness of operating livestock, sideline occupations, and planting industries, which is conducive to the development of organic agriculture that combines labor-intensive and technology-intensive. Starting from China's reality, the author analyzes the nature of peasant family economy after the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, discusses the specific forms that have been and will be produced, and believes that it will develop in the trend of small and comprehensive, small and specialized, and collective and specialized, thus adapting to the requirements of agricultural modernization. The view that attempts to artificially eliminate rural family economy is not in line with the reality of China's agricultural productivity.

At the same time, the book conducts a relatively detailed analysis of the forms of cooperative economy under socialist commodity economy, pointing out its differences from collective farming, and its connection with peasant family management, which will produce diversified, multi-faceted, systematic, and networked characteristics, forming a cooperative organization network above numerous family economies. The author proposes that the basic form of the cooperative system is the service organization before and after production, including supply and marketing, credit, technology, processing, information, and various professional cooperative organizations. Of course, comprehensive service cooperative organizations with regional characteristics are also indispensable. For shareholding cooperative organizations, mainly township enterprises, the book conducts an in-depth analysis and believes that rural shareholding enterprises are an inevitable trend, but from the reality of our country, it is not appropriate to force a single model. It should develop and improve gradually from primary to advanced, from informal to standardized. In order to develop rural commodity economy and optimize the cooperative system, the book puts forward many new insights on price reform, preferential policies, political system reform, and spiritual civilization construction. This is of important reference value for us to broaden the thinking of deepening rural reforms.

Human cognition is always limited. This book reflects a stage of our cognition, and there are many issues that need to be deepened. Although it also draws on foreign experience, the utilization of materials on foreign cooperative organizations is relatively insufficient, which is a shortcoming of this book. It is hoped that in the future revision, this deficiency can be made up for.

    读《社会主义商品经济下的合作制和家庭经济》
    黄道霞
    自我国实行联产承包责任制以来，理论界对农村经济关系和社会化趋势讨论热烈，争论迭起，而且这种讨论、研究，正随着农村改革的深化不断推陈出新。在这一历史条件下，杨承训同志从我国农村改革的实际出发，总结了国内外的历史经验，研究了马克思主义合作制的理论与实践，编著了《社会主义商品经济下的合作制和家庭经济》一书（中国社会科学出版社1988年出版），对我国农村经济改革进行了理论开拓。它对探索有中国特色的合作经济和现代化道路，具有重要的参考价值。
    该书在理论上的突破，首先表现为否定了以产品经济为基础的共耕制模式，揭示出合作制与商品经济的内在联系。作者研究了国内合作社的发展，实事求是地总结了社会主义国家的经验教训，尤其是发掘了列宁合作制思想，提出马克思主义合作制理论有一个否定之否定的发展过程，认定“社会主义商品经济理论是认识合作制的一把钥匙”，“商品经济和合作制之间有一个相通的东西，就是生产的社会化。”从各发达国家合作社的历史看，它是商品经济发展到一定阶段的产物，而且只有按商品经济的要求组织合作社，才会有强大生命力。因此，提出必须从商品经济中寻找动因，要适应商品经济的特点建立多种形式的合作组织。该书进一步分析了我国农村商品经济发展的特点，预计大致有几个发展阶段，所有这些都有可能对农村合作经济的发展产生重大影响。
    该书的另一点突破，表现在对社会主义商品经济下农民家庭经济的论述上。作者分析了历史事实，认为家庭经济与农业生产的特点有不解之缘，它“真正是一个适应性很强的社会经济细胞，它在各个时代都能比较适应农业生产活动复杂而矛盾的要求。在农业工厂化生产，即人造蛋白制造工业还没有代替农业之前，家庭经济的存在就是一种必然现象”。作者大胆地否定了社会主义消灭农民家庭经济的理论，肯定新式家庭经济的生命力。社会主义农业所以要扬弃和利用这种古老的形式，就是因为它具有多方面的适应性、各式各样的灵活性以及经营牧业、副业和种植业的综合性，便于发展劳动密集和技术密集相结合的有机农业。作者从我国的实际出发，解析了实行联产承包后农民家庭经济的性质，论述了已经产生和即将产生的多级多类的具体形式，认为它将沿着小而全——小而专——集而专的趋势发展，从而与农业现代化要求相适应。那种企图人为地消灭农村家庭经济的观点，是不符合我国农业生产力的实际的。
    同时，该书对社会主义商品经济下合作经济的形式进行了比较详细的分析，指出它与共耕制的区别，而与农民家庭经营相联系，将产生多样化、多边化、系统化、网络化的特点，在众多的家庭经济之上形成一个合作组织网。作者提出，合作制的基本形式是产前产后的服务组织，包括供销、信贷、科技、加工、信息等各种专业合作组织，当然地域性综合服务的合作组织也是不可少的。对于股份式合作组织，主要是乡镇企业，该书作了较深的分析，认为农村股份制企业是一个必然趋势，但从我国实际出发不能强求一个模式，应当由初级到高级、由不规范到规范化逐步发展和完善。为了发展农村商品经济，优化合作制，书中对价格改革、优惠政策、政治体制改革和精神文明建设等方面，提出了许多新的见解。这对于我们拓宽农村深化改革的思路，具有重要的参考价值。
    人的认识总是有局限性的。该书反映了我们认识的一个阶段，有许多问题尚待深化。虽然它也借鉴国外的经验，但对国外合作组织的资料利用较少，这是该书的不足之处。希望在今后修订时，足补此瑕。
