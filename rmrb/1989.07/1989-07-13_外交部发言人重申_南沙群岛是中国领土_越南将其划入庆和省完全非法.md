Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 13th.

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at a press conference this afternoon that recently, the fifth session of the eighth National Assembly of Vietnam passed a resolution, arbitrarily including China's Spratly Islands into Vietnam's Khánh Hòa Province, which is a blatant infringement upon China's territorial sovereignty.

The spokesperson said that it is well-known that the Spratly Islands have been China's territory since ancient times, and China has indisputable sovereignty over these islands and their adjacent waters. The aforementioned resolution by the Vietnamese National Assembly is completely illegal and invalid.

    外交部发言人重申
    南沙群岛是中国领土
    越南将其划入庆和省完全非法
    新华社北京7月13日电　外交部发言人今天下午在新闻发布会上发表谈话时说，最近，越南第八届国会第五次会议通过决议，竟然将中国的南沙群岛划入越南的庆和省，粗暴地侵犯了中国的领土主权。
    发言人说，众所周知，南沙群岛自古以来就是中国的领土，中国对该群岛及其附近水域拥有无可争辩的主权。越南国会的上述决议完全是非法的、无效的。
