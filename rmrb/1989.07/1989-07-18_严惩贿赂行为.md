Crack Down on Bribery

To promote clean governance and eliminate corruption, it is crucial to combat bribery within the Party and society.

Bribery encompasses receiving bribes, giving bribes, and facilitating bribery. Receiving bribes refers to state officials using their positions to benefit others in exchange for money or goods. Giving bribes involves using money or goods to influence officials to act in one's favor. Giving bribes plays a key role in initiating and corrupting officials; without it, receiving bribes would be difficult. Facilitating bribery involves a third party arranging for the giver and receiver of bribes to complete the transaction. In summary, giving and receiving bribes are mutual, illegal activities.

People often say, "Where there is bait, there are fish." In recent years, some Party members and state officials have blatantly engaged in bribery, using their power for personal gain and disregarding principles. Issues that should be resolved through regular duties are deliberately obstructed unless personal benefits are secured. Conversely, actions clearly against policies and laws are carried out if personal gains are involved. The public's anger is often directed at these corrupt practices. Therefore, when investigating bribery cases, we should focus on cases of receiving bribes.

Regarding giving bribes, we cannot overlook them either. Of course, there are two types of motives for giving bribes. One is deliberate, using money and goods to corrupt weak-willed individuals within our ranks. The other is out of necessity. Various social malpractices sometimes block normal procedures, making it difficult to get things done without relying on connections and bribes. Even upright individuals may have to "go with the flow." This mutual interest relationship perpetuates the cycle of giving and receiving bribes, making the situation worse.

To eliminate bribery and corruption, it is essential to strengthen the anti-corruption capabilities of Party members and state officials. They must be able to resist negative influences and pass the tests of power and money in the new era of socialist market economy, fully committing themselves to serving the people. Those involved in bribery, regardless of their identity, must be investigated and punished according to Party discipline, administrative regulations, and the law, without any leniency. Only by doing so can we effectively eliminate corruption and promote clean governance.

    严惩贿赂行为
    抓廉政建设，消除腐败现象，一个很重要的方面是要同党内和社会上的贿赂行为进行斗争。
    贿赂包括受贿、行贿和介绍贿赂。受贿，是指国家工作人员利用职务之便，为他人谋取利益而索取或者非法收受他人财物的行为；行贿，则是用钱、物收买他人，使其利用职权为自己谋取私利。行贿对贿赂案件起着诱发和腐蚀作用，没有它，受贿难以产生。介绍贿赂，是指由于第三人的撮合，使行贿人与受贿人达成了贿赂交易。总之，行贿受贿，是以双方相互利用为目的的一种违法行为。
    人们常说，香饵之下，必有死鱼。这几年来，确有那么一些以权谋私、见利忘义的党员干部、国家工作人员，明目张胆地把人人痛恨的贿赂行为带进了“官场”。本该属于本职工作可以解决的问题，他们如果得不到好处，就故意刁难一番；反过来，一些事明明违背了政策和法律，只要他们觉得有利可图，便徇情枉法在所不惜。所谓群众骂娘，其实骂得最凶的，也不外乎是这种腐败现象。所以，我们在查处贿赂案件中，要把受贿案件作为重点。
    对于行贿问题，也不能放过。当然，行贿人也有两种动机。一是故意为之，即不择手段地用金钱物质拉拢、腐蚀我们队伍中的一些意志薄弱者，使其“下水”；二是不得已而为之。社会上的各种不正之风，在某种程度上使通过正常途径、正当手续办事受阻，而要顺利办成某件事，就必须托人情拉关系，靠“行贿”开路。一些正派的人也不得不“入乡随俗”了。正是这种相互的利益关系，使得行贿受贿的坏风气越刮越烈，恶性循环。
    要消除贿赂这种腐败现象，关键是要增强广大党员和国家工作人员的反腐蚀能力，使他们能自觉抵制歪风邪气的侵蚀，过好在发展社会主义商品经济新形势下的“权力关”、“金钱关”，全心全意为人民服务。对于搞贿赂者，不管是什么人，都要予以查办，凡违犯了党纪政纪、国法的必须惩处，不留情面。只有这样，消除腐败，搞好廉政建设才能真正落到实处。
