Medical experts have made a significant breakthrough in meridian research. Using tracer technology, they have successfully displayed the migration paths of meridians. The reporter Ai Xiao reports from Beijing on July 14th: The ongoing national "Seventh Five-Year Plan" key research project—using radioactive isotopes to objectively display the meridian pathways—has shown interesting experimental results today at the Isotope Room of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army. A small amount of non-toxic and harmless tracer (a compound of the radioactive element technetium) was injected into the acupuncture points of the human body. Using a large-field digital camera to scan and image, one can see the clear trajectory of the radioactive substance migrating along the meridians of the human body on the screen.

According to experts from the Acupuncture Research Institute of the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army who are engaged in this research, the results of 845 human body tests that have been completed indicate that 100% of the 12 meridians have been imaged. This provides a physical basis for the descriptions of meridians in traditional Chinese medicine.

    经络研究获新突破
    医学专家采用示踪技术成功显示循经迁移轨迹
    本报北京7月14日讯　记者艾笑报道：正在进行中的国家“七五”攻关课题——用放射性核素示踪客观显示经脉循行的方法学研究，今天在解放军总医院同位素室展示了有趣的实验结果：取微量无毒无害的示踪剂（放射元素锝的化合物）注入人体穴位，用大视野数字式照相机扫描显像。这时，人们看到屏幕上出现了放射物沿人体经脉向心迁移循行的清晰轨迹……
    据中国中医研究院针灸研究所和解放军总医院从事这项研究的专家介绍，已经完成的845例人体测试结果表明，100％有12经脉显像，使中医对经络的描述，有了实物存在依据。
