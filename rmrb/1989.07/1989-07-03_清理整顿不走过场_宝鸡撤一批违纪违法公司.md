    The city of Baoji in Shaanxi Province has, since September last year, canceled 198 companies that either lacked the conditions for operation or were engaged in illegal activities, after conducting a thorough investigation of all types of companies.

    Since the second half of 1986, Baoji City has established a total of 368 companies of various kinds, including 91 set up by various levels of party and government agencies. The comprehensive service company of the municipal grain bureau took advantage of its industry management authority, using methods such as low-price allocation and high-price resale, to sell 145,000 kilograms of bran and black flour at high prices, illegally gaining 59,000 yuan. After the investigation, its business license was revoked, and all its illegal gains were confiscated and turned over to the state treasury. After the clean-up and rectification, 64 of the companies run by party and government agencies have been canceled. The remaining 27 are all labor service companies set up to arrange employment for unemployed youth.

    清理整顿不走过场
    宝鸡撤一批违纪违法公司
    本报西安7月3日电　记者景险峰报道：去年9月以来，陕西省宝鸡市在查清各类公司底数的基础上，撤销了198个不具备经营条件或专搞谋私的各类公司。
    1986年下半年以来，宝鸡市新成立各类公司共368个，其中各级党政机关开办91个。市粮食局机关综合服务公司利用行业管理职权，采取平价调拨、议价倒卖的手法，高价售出麸皮、黑粉145万公斤，牟取非法暴利5.9万元，查出后被吊销了营业执照，并将其非法所得全部没收，上缴财政。经过清理整顿，党政机关办的公司已撤销64户。保留的27户，均为安排待业青年的劳动服务公司。
