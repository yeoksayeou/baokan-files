Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission Hong Xuezhi wrote an article on the eve of "August 1st," congratulating the publication and distribution of the two-volume "Chinese Encyclopedia: Military."

In his article, General Hong Xuezhi stated that the military volume of the encyclopedia, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, emphasizes China's unique characteristics, focuses on national defense modernization and future anti-aggression wars, and primarily introduces Marxist military theories and Mao Zedong's military thoughts. It uses the standpoint, viewpoints, and methods of dialectical and historical materialism to explain and answer various military academic questions. Many entries have innovative insights and fresh ideas. The military volume is divided into 25 sub-disciplines, covering all aspects of military science and systematically introducing scientific knowledge in various fields. Most entries reflect content related to China and the Chinese military, compiling the essence of Chinese military theory from ancient times to the present, showcasing the historical development and new achievements of China's military technology, and exhibiting a distinct Chinese style and characteristics.

Hong Xuezhi said that the military volume is a collective creation, a crystallization of the wisdom of the entire military. Revolutionary elders and military leaders such as Ye Jianying, Xu Xiangqian, and Nie Rongzhen, a group of high-ranking generals of the Chinese military, and renowned experts from the national defense science and technology front participated in the writing and proofreading. This scientific work has a high quality and authority, basically reflecting the current development level of China's military science, and is able to withstand the test of history.
