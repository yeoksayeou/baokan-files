    Hair embroidery is a unique and exquisite art form among China's traditional embroidery works. At the Guangzhou Trade Fair, the "hair embroidery double-sided embroidery" with its unique materials, exquisite craftsmanship, elegant and refined style, and everlasting colors, has amazed both domestic and foreign businessmen, who praise it as a "rare masterpiece."

    Hair embroidery, as a traditional craft, has a history of at least a thousand years in China. The earliest known hair embroidery, a portrait of "Dongfang Shuo," is a treasure from the Southern Song Dynasty and is now exhibited at the British Museum in London. A hair embroidery treasure from the Ming Dynasty, "Maitreya Buddha," is preserved in Japan's Shōsōin. Initially, hair embroidery was created and spread by Buddhist devotees who, out of reverence for the Buddha, cut their long hair to embroider images of the Buddha, Guanyin, and the Tathagata as objects of worship. Therefore, for a long time, hair embroidery was closely associated with religious activities, primarily depicting the images and expressions of Buddhist figures. Later, as hair embroidery spread and became more popular, and with the development and changes of society and history, hair embroidery gradually broke free from religious themes and expanded its content. The Shanghai Museum's collection of a Ming Jiajing period embroidery, "Stopping the Qin to Wait for the Moon," is based on the poetry of Tao Yuanming. This unique craft was on the verge of extinction during the late Qing Dynasty.

    After the founding of New China, the Suzhou Special Craft Research Institute first excavated and revived the traditional hair embroidery craft, creating a large-scale hair embroidery "Portrait of Qu Yuan," which is now exhibited at the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall in Beijing. Comrade Zhu De also specially wrote a poem to praise it. Today, the hair embroidery works from Dongtai, Jiangsu, have become highly sought-after art treasures at the Guangzhou Trade Fair.

    Today, traditional hair embroidery has been developed into "double-sided embroidery." The ancient hair embroidery craft has reached a new artistic peak.

### “发绣”今昔

    “发绣”今昔
    中国的传统绣品中发绣可谓独树一帜、堪称一绝。广州的交易会上，那用材之奇、绣工之精，清质素雅且永不褪色的“发绣双面绣”，令中外客商赞叹不已，称其为“罕见精品”。
    发绣作为一种传统的工艺在我国至少有一千多年的历史了。如今发现流传下来的最早的一幅发绣《东方朔》像，是南宋时期的珍品，现陈列在英国的伦敦博物院。而明代的一幅发绣珍品《弥勒像》则收藏在日本的正仓院。由于发绣最初的时候是一些佛教信女们出于对菩萨的虔诚，剪下自己的长发，或绣佛、绣观音、如来，作为自己膜拜的对象而逐渐产生、流传起来的，因此，在很长的一段时间里，发绣与宗教活动的联系比较紧密，多以绣佛像的神态姿容为主要内容。到后来，随着发绣的流传和普及，社会历史的发展和变迁，发绣才慢慢地突破了宗教题材的局限，而越来越拓宽了它的表现内容。上海博物馆收藏的明嘉靖年间的绣品《停琴伫月图》就是以陶渊明的诗意为内容而创作的。这一独特的工艺在晚清时已经濒于失传。
    新中国成立以后，首先是苏州特种工艺研究室的同志们，在挖掘传统发绣工艺的同时创作了一幅大型发绣《屈原像》，陈列于北京全国农业展览馆。朱德同志还专门为此题诗赞扬。现在，江苏东台的发绣作品在广交会上成为外商们竞相争购的艺术珍品。
    今天，传统发绣又被创造发展成了“双面绣”。古老的发绣工艺已经跃上了一个新的艺术高峰。
