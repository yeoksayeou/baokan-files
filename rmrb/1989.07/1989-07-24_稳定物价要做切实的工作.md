The harm caused by rapid price increases is well-known; the importance of stabilizing prices has been emphasized many times. Currently, the most important thing in this regard is to do practical work. This is the lesson we learn from the price control work in Taiyuan City.

Can prices be stabilized? There are different views on this issue. Indeed, the causes of inflation are multifaceted, and these problems have accumulated over the years, making them difficult to solve in the short term. Controlling prices is naturally challenging. The forecast for the first half of this year is that the overall level of national retail prices will still be 25.5% higher than the same period last year. This tells us that there is still much work to be done in stabilizing prices and that great efforts are needed.

It should be pointed out that some leading comrades still only complain about price increases or wait for higher authorities to come up with solutions, rather than actively taking measures themselves to solve some problems. Therefore, in some places, the price increase trend cannot be controlled, and it continues to rise, causing significant public dissatisfaction.

The value of Taiyuan City's experience lies in their focus on practical work. They feel that in this major matter, there is still much that can be done. Practice has proven that by taking concrete actions, results can be achieved. In June, the prices in Taiyuan City showed a downward trend.

In stabilizing prices, it is important to leverage the role of state-owned commerce, especially in the wholesale sector. If the main channels are well-managed, stable, and unobstructed, it will be much harder for "official speculators" and "private speculators" to take advantage and drive up prices, harming the people.

In the new situation, to rectify the order in the circulation sector and stabilize prices, we must also create new methods. Taiyuan City established the Price Stabilization Promotion Association and implemented a series of measures, mobilizing the efforts of the relevant departments, enterprises, and the masses, which played an important role. This is a very beneficial attempt. It shows that solutions are always available, the key is for everyone to work hard to create them. By doing more practical work and less empty talk, our work will be more effective.

### 稳定物价要做切实的工作

    稳定物价要做切实的工作
    物价上涨过猛的危害，已经众所周知；稳定物价的重要意义，也已经说过多遍。当前，在这方面，最重要的是要多做切切实实的工作。这是太原市物价工作调查给我们的启示。
    物价能不能稳定？在这个问题上存在着不同的看法。的确，通货膨胀的原因是多方面的，而且，问题也是这些年积累起来的，非短期内可以完全解决。平抑物价自然难度较大。今年上半年预计全国商品零售价格总水平仍比去年同期上涨25.5％。这就告诉我们，在稳定物价方面，还有许多工作要做，还需作出极大的努力。
    应当指出，现在确实有些领导同志，对物价上涨还只是停留在发牢骚上，或等待上级拿出办法来，而很少自己开动脑筋、积极采取措施，解决一些问题。所以，在有些地方物价涨势总是压不下来，而且不断上升，群众意见很大。
    太原市经验的可贵之处，就在于他们把着眼点放在切实的工作上。他们感到，在这件重大事情上，并非无所作为。实践证明，切实地抓了，就有了实效。那里6月份物价已出现回落趋向。
    在稳定物价中，要注意发挥国营商业的主渠道作用，特别是在批发业方面，更应如此。主渠道管好了，稳住了，畅通了，那些“官倒”、“私倒”再想乘机哄抬物价，坑害老百姓，也就困难多了。
    在新的形势下，整顿流通领域秩序，稳定物价，还要注意创造新的方法。太原市建立平抑物价促进会并采取了一套措施，把主管部门、企业、群众几个方面的力量组织起来，发挥了重要的作用，就是一个很有益的尝试。这说明，办法总归是有的，关键在于大家努力去创造。多作些切实工作，少来些空泛的议论，我们的事业就会办得好一些。
