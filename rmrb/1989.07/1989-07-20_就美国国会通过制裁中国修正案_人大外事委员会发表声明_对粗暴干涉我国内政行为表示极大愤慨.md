The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China held a full meeting in the Great Hall of the People on the afternoon of July 19 and issued a statement regarding the U.S. Congress passing the China sanctions amendment. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Statement by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China on the U.S. Congress Passing the China Sanctions Amendment (July 19, 1989)

1. On June 29 and July 14, 1989, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate respectively passed amendments to sanction China. These amendments grossly distorted the facts of China's efforts to quell the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, baselessly defamed and attacked the Chinese government, and proposed a series of sanctions against China. We express our utmost indignation at the U.S. Congress' blatant interference in China's internal affairs and its serious harm to the feelings of the Chinese people.

2. Facts have shown that the disturbances that occurred in Beijing from April to June this year were not merely actions demanding democracy and human rights. Instead, a small number of individuals colluded with certain hostile forces abroad to exploit the student movement and orchestrate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil. Their goal and actions were to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China, which are serious crimes against the Constitution and criminal law of the People's Republic of China. Over the past two months, the Chinese government has maintained a highly restrained attitude. A small group of rioters, taking advantage of the government's restraint, engaged in horrifying acts of beating, smashing, looting, arson, and murder, plunging China's capital, Beijing, into a state of severe anarchy. To maintain national security and social order, and in a situation of extreme provocation, the Chinese government, in accordance with the Constitution and the law, took decisive measures to suppress the rebellion. This action is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the Chinese people and has received the resolute support of the people across the country. The situation in China has quickly improved after the suppression, and social order has gradually returned to normal. However, the U.S. Congress has completely ignored the above basic facts, using rumors as a basis, and in the amendments it passed, it falsely portrayed the rebellion as a "democratic movement," labeled a small number of individuals who seriously disrupted social order and attempted to overthrow the government as "peaceful demonstrators demanding democracy," and defamed the Chinese government's legal punishment of criminals who violated the criminal law as "suppressing peaceful demonstrations." The U.S. Congress' actions are highly irresponsible and have ulterior motives.

3. In a situation where the fate of the nation and the interests of the people are seriously threatened, taking necessary measures in accordance with the country's laws is a matter within the sovereignty of a country and an internal affair. No foreign government, parliament, organization, or individual has the right to interfere in any way.

It should be pointed out that in this incident, China has not infringed upon any interests of the United States. Instead, the United States has deeply involved itself in China's internal affairs, infringing upon China's interests and dignity. Some members of the U.S. Congress, under the guise of defending "freedom," "democracy," and "human rights," have shamelessly interfered in China's internal affairs and repeatedly threatened to impose various sanctions on our country. This is absolutely unacceptable to the Chinese people. On matters concerning the defense of national sovereignty, independence, and dignity, China will not be ambiguous and will never yield to any external pressure. Attempting to impose sanctions on China to exert pressure and force China to change its policies is futile and will only result in backfiring, ultimately harming the interests of the United States itself.

4. The social systems and ideologies of China and the United States are different, which is an objective fact. Every nation has the right to choose a social system and development path that suits its national conditions. Relations between countries should not be based on imposing one's own social system and values on others. As agreed upon by both sides in the Shanghai Communiqué, countries, regardless of their social systems, should handle relations between countries based on the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence. Only by strictly adhering to these principles can the relationship between the two countries develop in a healthy manner. If these principles are violated, it will inevitably seriously damage the relationship between the two countries. We urge the U.S. Congress not to violate the basic wishes of the peoples of China and the United States, and from the long-term interests of the two countries, immediately stop all actions that interfere in China's internal affairs, hurt the national feelings of the Chinese people, and damage the relationship between the two countries.

    就美国国会通过制裁中国修正案
    人大外事委员会发表声明
    对粗暴干涉我国内政行为表示极大愤慨
    新华社北京7月20日电  全国人大外事委员会于19日下午在人民大会堂召开全体会议，发表了关于美国国会通过制裁中国的修正案的声明。声明全文如下：
    中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会外事委员会关于美国国会通过制裁中国的修正案的声明（1989年7月19日）
    一、1989年6月29日和7月14日，美国国会众议院和参议院先后通过制裁中国的修正案，肆意歪曲我国制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的事实真相，毫无根据地污蔑和攻击中国政府，并提出一系列对中国的制裁措施。对美国国会这种粗暴干涉中国内政、严重伤害中国人民感情的行为，我们表示极大愤慨。
    二、大量事实表明，今年4月至6月间北京发生的这场风波，根本不是一般的要求民主和人权的行动，而是极少数人勾结国外某些敌对势力，利用学潮掀起的一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在北京发展成为反革命暴乱。他们的目的和行动是推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国，这是违反中华人民共和国宪法和刑法的严重罪行。在近两个月时间里，中国政府一直采取十分克制的态度。一小撮暴徒视政府的克制态度为软弱可欺，进行骇人听闻的打、砸、抢、烧、杀活动，使中国的首都北京陷入了严重的无政府状态。为了维护国家安全和社会秩序，在忍无可忍的情况下，中国政府依照宪法和法律，采取果断措施平息暴乱。这一行动符合中国人民的愿望和根本利益，得到了全国人民的坚决支持。平暴后中国局势迅速好转，社会秩序现已逐步恢复正常。但是，美国国会却完全无视上述基本事实，以谣言作为依据，在所通过的修正案中，硬把暴乱说成是“要求民主的运动”，把少数严重破坏社会秩序、企图推翻政府的暴徒叫做“要求民主的和平示威者”，而把中国政府依法惩处触犯刑律的犯罪分子污蔑成“镇压和平示威”。美国国会这种行为，是极不严肃的，别有用心的。
    三、在国家的命运和人民的利益受到严重威胁的紧急情况下，根据本国的法律采取必要措施，这是一个国家主权范围之内的事情，是一个国家的内部事务，任何外国政府、议会、组织和个人都无权以任何方式进行干涉。
    应该指出，在这一事件的过程中，中国并未触犯美国的任何利益，而是美国深深卷入中国的内政，触犯了中国的利益和尊严。美国国会有些人打着维护“自由”、“民主”和“人权”的旗号，肆无忌惮地干涉中国内政，并一再叫嚣对我国采取种种制裁措施，这是中国人民绝对不能接受的。在涉及捍卫国家主权、独立和尊严问题上，中国决不含糊，永远不会屈服于任何外来压力。企图通过制裁向中国施加压力，迫使中国改变政策，完全是徒劳的，结果只会搬起石头砸自己的脚，最终也将损害美国本身的利益。
    四、中美两国社会制度和意识形态不同，这是一个客观事实。每一个国家的人民都有权选择适合本国国情的社会制度和发展道路。国家之间的关系不应该建立在将自己的社会制度和价值观念强加于别国的基础上。正如中美双方在上海公报中所一致同意的，各国无论社会制度如何，都应根据互相尊重主权和领土完整、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的原则来处理国与国之间的关系。只有双方都严格地遵循这些原则，两国关系才能健康地发展。如果违背这些原则，就必将使两国关系受到严重的损害。我们敦促美国国会不要违背中美两国人民的基本意愿，从中美两国的长远利益出发，立即停止一切干涉中国内政、伤害中国人民民族感情、损害两国关系的言行。
