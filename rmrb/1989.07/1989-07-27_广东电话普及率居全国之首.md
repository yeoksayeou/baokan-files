In the first half of this year, Guangdong Province added 180,000 new urban and rural telephone exchange capacities, making the total telephone capacity and popularization rate the highest in the nation.

Guangdong has accelerated the reform of its postal and telecommunications system, mobilizing enthusiasm from all sides to develop the postal and telecommunications industry. This has led to a rapid increase in telephone capacity and a steadily growing telephone popularization rate. In 1980, the province had an average of one telephone for every 400 people in urban and rural areas. By the end of June this year, the total telephone capacity in the province had reached 1.17 million, making it the only province in the nation to exceed one million. On average, there is one telephone for every 50 people.
