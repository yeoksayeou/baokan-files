The national flag has risen, rising in the calm Tiananmen Square, rising in the majestic military music, rising in the solemn salute of the loyal soldiers.

At this moment, China's land, the Great Wall and the Yangtze River, Huangshan and the Yellow River, from the East China Sea fishing grounds to the Pamir Plateau, from the stilt houses of the South China Sea to the watchtowers on the banks of the Heilongjiang River, are all watching this fluttering five-star red flag. Overseas Chinese around the world are also watching this five-star red flag.

Because this flag is woven from the labor and love of the Chinese people. In the dense warp and weft, there are the wishes of the people from generation to generation, the entrustments of the martyrs, the admonitions of the mothers, the hopes of the children, and the blood shed by the soldiers today.

The chaotic clouds have been swept away, and the motherland has welcomed another dawn.

The national flag rises with the morning glow, with the golden rays of the rising sun, with the spreading green leaves and the round bird calls.

The national flag flutters and rolls in the fresh morning breeze, calling out...

The land of the motherland needs a relaxed breath, needs a united and intimate atmosphere, needs a quiet and warm life, needs a tense and passionate construction symphony...

The national flag reflects the smiles of the people and their respect for the brave soldiers.

The national flag is watching over the land of China. The people, who have undergone another tempering, stride forward with steady and determined steps towards a brilliant future.

Tiananmen Square is a history, a history from suffering to resistance, from backwardness to revitalization, from turmoil to stability.

People will not forget the history of the Eight-Nation Alliance's beastly hooves trampling Tiananmen, nor will they forget the history of the May Fourth Movement, when the great tide of the nation surged over Tiananmen.

People will not forget the founding ceremony, when cheers and flowers filled the square, nor will they forget the history of the Red Tide howling and raging during the ten years of turmoil.

Of course, all this has become the past.

Now, the Tiananmen Square in people's hearts is a land of joy woven with flowers, songs, and lamps. National leaders welcome dignitaries from various countries here, countless tourists come here to visit and take photos. Lovers stroll in the evening breeze and flower fragrance, and Young Pioneers hold their activities in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes... All this is bathed in the serene and sacred light.

Tiananmen Square is the sacred land of the Chinese nation, shining brightly in the hearts of the people.

Who would have thought that this square would once again become a place where fog and ambition reign, that the heart of the motherland would be tainted, and that so many people would look up to Beijing with anxiety and worry!

So, you came, with the fearless courage and loyalty of soldiers, to fight a special battle to defend Tiananmen Square—clearing away the fog and ambition in one fell swoop, restoring the glory and sanctity, tranquility, and joy of Tiananmen Square!

Look, the jade orchid lamps on the square are so crystal clear and brilliant!

The people thank you! Because you have restored the glory and sanctity, tranquility, and joy to the hearts of every patriot!

China is a ship, and the Monument to the People's Heroes is the mast of the ship.

When the first five-star red flag was raised in Tiananmen Square, this mast proudly held aloft the great aspirations of New China, guiding the people towards a new journey.

The ocean of the times is not calm. There are storms and thunder, and there are thick clouds and huge waves.

But this tall mast is unyielding in the wind and waves. Because the helmsman of this ship is steadfast—steadfastly sailing towards the ideal world of humanity.

When the storm and rain once again swept across the land, although the waves were treacherous and the fog was thick, the mast of the ship stood firm.

Because generation after generation of revolutionary successors have cast their hopes and love, loyalty and blood into the foundation of this mast.

Look, the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes is rising, and beneath the original sculptures, new sculptures appear—resisting American aggression and aiding Korea, suppressing bandits and rebels, self-defense counterattacks, and your solemn formation marching into the square!

The mast proudly holds aloft the spirit and determination of the Chinese people!

This mast will not tilt, will not be broken or twisted, and no force can change the direction of history!

    军人与祖国
    （三章）
    柯原
          国　旗
    国旗升起来了，在平静下来的天安门广场升起，在雄壮的军乐声中升起，在威严列队的战士们忠诚的注目礼中升起。
    此时，中国的大地，长城与长江，黄山与黄河，从东海渔场到帕米尔高原，从南沙群岛的高脚楼到黑龙江畔的哨楼，都在注视这面飞动的五星红旗。全世界各地的华夏子孙，也在注视着这一面五星红旗。
    因为这面旗帜是中华民族的劳动与爱所织成的。在密密的经线纬线中，有人民世世代代的心愿，烈士的嘱托，母亲的叮咛，孩子的希望，以及，今日战士们洒下的鲜血。
    乱翻的乌云被扫清了，祖国迎来了又一个黎明。
    国旗和朝霞一道升起，和初升太阳的金色光芒一道升起，和伸展的绿叶、圆润的鸟啼一道升起。
    国旗在清新的晨风中招展着，舒卷着，呼唤着……
    祖国大地需要舒畅的呼吸，需要团结亲密的气氛，需要宁静而温馨的生活，需要紧张而热烈的建设进行曲……
    国旗映出人民的笑意和对忠勇的子弟兵的敬意。
    国旗在注视着华夏大地，经受了又一次锻炼的人民，迈开沉着而坚定的步伐，向光辉的未来继续前进。
        天安门广场
    天安门广场是一部历史，一部从受难到反抗，从落后到振兴，从动乱到安定的历史。
    人们不会忘记八国联军的兽蹄，耀武扬威地践踏天安门的历史，也不会忘记五四运动，声势浩大的民族浪潮涌过天安门的历史。
    人们不会忘记开国大典，欢呼与鲜花铺满广场的历史，也不会忘记十年动乱中，红色狂潮呼啸发热的历史。
    自然，这一切都已成为往事。
    如今，映在人们心灵上的天安门广场，是一片鲜花、歌声与灯盏交织成的欢乐天地。国家领导人在这儿迎接各国贵宾，无数旅游者在这儿游览、拍照。情侣们在晚风与花香中散步，少先队员在人民英雄纪念碑前举行队日活动……这一切都浴满了宁静圣洁的光辉。
    天安门广场，是中华民族的圣地，在人民的心上闪闪发光。
    谁会想到，这广场又会成为迷雾与野心盘踞的地方，祖国的心灵一度被玷污，多少人翘首望北京，忧心如焚！
    于是，你们来了，以战士无畏的赤胆与忠心，进行了一场特殊的保卫天安门广场的战斗——一举荡涤了迷雾与野心，恢复了天安门广场的光辉与圣洁，宁静与欢乐！
    看，广场上的玉兰花灯，多么晶莹璀璨！
    人民感谢你们啊！因为你们使每个爱国者的心灵，都恢复了光辉与圣洁、宁静与欢乐！
      人民英雄纪念碑
    中国是一艘航船，人民英雄纪念碑是航船上的桅杆。
    当第一面五星红旗在天安门广场上升起，这桅杆高举着新中国的壮志豪情，引导人民驶向新的航程。
    时代的海洋是并不平静的。有狂风暴雨，雷鸣电闪，也有浓云密雾，狂浪巨澜。
    而这高耸的桅杆，在风浪中是无比坚定的。因为这艘航船的舵手是坚定的——坚定地驶向人类的理想世界。
    当大地上又一次狂风暴雨袭来时，虽然波诡云谲，迷雾重重，但航船的桅杆岸然挺立。
    因为一代又一代革命后来人，把自己的希望与爱、忠诚与鲜血，铸进这桅杆的基座。
    看吧，人民英雄纪念碑的基座正在升高，在原有的雕塑下面，又出现了一幅幅新的雕塑——抗美援朝，剿匪平叛，自卫还击，以及你们列队走入广场的庄严形象！
    桅杆高擎着中国人民的志气与决心！
    这桅杆是不会倾斜、不会被折断和扭曲的，什么力量也改不了历史的方向！
