Title: The African Debt Crisis Should Be Taken Seriously

From a global economic perspective, the North is rich while the South is poor. Africa, which is already impoverished, is being further impoverished by the heavy burden of debt.

The 25th Summit of the Organization of African Unity, currently being held in Addis Ababa, has as one of its themes the renewed appeal for North-South dialogue to jointly resolve the debt crisis.

The following figures illustrate the severity of Africa's debt burden: Africa's total external debt has reached $230 billion, which is three-quarters of the continent's annual national income and continues to grow; out of the 37 countries recognized worldwide as the poorest, 28 are in Africa; Africa's annual debt repayment and interest payments account for 40% of its export earnings; according to a conservative estimate by World Bank experts, Africa's external debt will reach $313 billion in six years.

Western creditor countries and organizations have yet to come up with effective solutions to Africa's severe debt crisis. Two years ago, the Organization of African Unity called for a North-South debt conference, but the call was rejected. Last year, France's proposal to cancel the debts of poor African countries did not receive the support of the G7 summit. Under pressure from global public opinion, the United States proposed the "Brady Plan" to reduce debt. African countries, from their own interests, pointed out that the "Brady Plan" has little effect on alleviating Africa's debt crisis because the 20% debt reduction it aims to achieve is limited to commercial loans, while 75% of Africa's debt is government loans or government-guaranteed loans.

As the global economy becomes increasingly interconnected, Western economic experts believe that the worsening debt crisis in developing countries will ultimately limit their development prospects. The early resolution of the debt issue is in the interest of both debtor and creditor countries.

Recently, Egypt, India, Venezuela, Senegal, and other countries, as representatives of the "South," proposed to the G7 summit the convening of a world summit of South and North leaders to jointly seek solutions to the debt problems of the Third World. However, the G7 summit did not come up with any positive suggestions on the debt issue.

This summit of the Organization of African Unity will once again appeal to creditor countries to help push for a resolution to the debt problem.

    应该重视非洲债务危机
    本报记者　林皎明
    从世界经济形势看，北富南穷。而贫困的非洲正在被沉重的债务榨得穷上加穷。
    正在亚的斯亚贝巴召开的非统组织第25届国家元首和政府首脑会议的主题之一就是再次发出呼吁，推动南北对话，合理解决债务危机。
    从下面这几个数字可看出非洲的债务已何等沉重：非洲各国外债总额已经高达2300亿美元，这是全非年国民收入的3／4，而且还在不断增长；世界公认的37个最贫穷国家有28个在非洲；
    非洲每年还本付息额占出口额的40％；
    据世界银行专家比较保守的估算，再过6年，非洲外债将达到3130亿美元。
    西方债权国及组织对非洲严峻债务危机总也拿不出有效的解决办法。前两年，非统组织呼吁召开南北债务会谈，遭到拒绝。去年，法国有关减免非洲贫穷国家债务的建议，也没有得到西方7国首脑会议的赞同。美国在世界舆论压力下抛出一份削减债务的“布雷迪计划”。非洲国家从切身利益出发，指出“布雷迪计划”对非洲缓解债务危机作用甚微。因为这份计划意欲减免的20％债务，仅限于商业贷款，而非洲75％的债款是政府贷款或政府担保贷款。
    随着时代的发展，全球经济相互联系愈益密切。西方经济专家认为，发展中国家日益恶化的债务危机，到头来必然限制它们的发展前景。债务问题的早日解决于债务国和债权国都有利。
    前不久，埃及、印度、委内瑞拉、塞内加尔等国以“南方”身份向西方7国首脑会议提出召开世界南北首脑会议，共同寻求解决第三世界债务问题。但西方7国首脑会议未能就债务问题提出积极的建议。
    这次非统首脑会议将再次向债权国发出呼吁，将有助于推动债务问题的解决。　（本报开罗7月23日电）
