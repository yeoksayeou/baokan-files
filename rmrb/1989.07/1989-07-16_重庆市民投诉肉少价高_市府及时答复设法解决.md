Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, July 16th —

Yesterday, Zhang Wenbin, the acting mayor of Chongqing, responded to residents' complaints about meat shortages and high prices. He stated that the municipal government will take specific measures to ensure the supply of fresh pork in the market and bring down meat prices within a week.

In recent days, some residents of Chongqing have written to municipal leaders, expressing concerns that the supply of fresh pork in state-run meat shops has significantly decreased, and market prices have surged sharply. The price of lean pork, for example, has risen from around 7 yuan per kilogram to 10 yuan.

Zhang Wenbin, speaking at a meeting attended by district and county leaders and heads of financial and commercial departments, said that due to the unprecedented severe flooding in Chongqing, the entire city is focused on disaster relief efforts, which has affected the allocation and market supply of pigs. However, we cannot use this as an excuse to avoid addressing the actual problems raised by the residents. To this end, the city has decided to take three measures: First, all relevant departments at the municipal, district, and county levels must fully repay the nearly 7 million yuan in pig purchase arrears from the first half of the year to farmers within 15 to 20 days, and no new "white receipts" (IOUs) will be issued. Second, the purchase price of pigs allocated from counties to the city and districts will be increased by 0.10 yuan per kilogram in the third quarter. Third, the bonus grain allocation for pigs allocated to the city and districts in the third quarter will remain unchanged.

    重庆市民投诉肉少价高  市府及时答复设法解决
    据新华社重庆7月16日电  （记者向虎）昨天，重庆市常务副市长张文彬对市民反映肉少价高问题作出答复：市政府将采取具体措施，保证市场鲜猪肉供应，并在一周内使鲜肉价格回落。
    最近几天，重庆市一些群众给市领导写信反映：国营肉店鲜猪肉供应明显减少，市场价格大幅度上涨，精瘦肉由每公斤7元左右涨到10元。
    张文彬在全市各区、县长及财贸部门负责人参加的会议上说，目前，由于重庆遭受了百年未有的特大洪涝灾害，全市都在奋力抗洪救灾，影响了生猪的调拨和市场供应。但我们决不能以此为借口，不去解决群众反映的实际问题。为此市里决定采取三项措施：第一，市、区、县各有关部门必须在15—20天内全部偿还上半年拖欠农民的近700万元的生猪款，不准再打新的“白条”。第二，三季度县调市、区的生猪每公斤提高收购价0.10元。第三，三季度内调市区的生猪奖售粮不变。
