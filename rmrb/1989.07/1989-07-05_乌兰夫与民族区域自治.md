Ulanfu has passed away, but the cause for which he dedicated his life will forever be etched in the hearts of all ethnic groups.

Comrade Ulanfu, as an outstanding leader of the Party's ethnic work and a distinguished ethnic leader, his name is closely linked with China's ethnic work, especially with China's system of ethnic regional autonomy. By reviewing the history of the formation, development, and gradual perfection of China's system of ethnic regional autonomy, one can vividly see the brilliant journey of Ulanfu's contributions to China's system of ethnic regional autonomy, from theory to practice.

I. Establishing the First Ethnic Autonomous Region

Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is China's first ethnic autonomous region, established on May 1, 1947. Many old comrades know that this was created by Ulanfu and a group of Mongol and Han comrades from Yan'an, who combined Marxism-Leninism's ethnic theory and the Party's ethnic policies with the realities of Inner Mongolia, uniting the revolutionary forces of all strata of the Mongolian people, and overcoming countless difficulties. The implementation of ethnic regional autonomy in areas where ethnic minorities reside, to maintain national unity and ethnic unity, was a decision by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. However, how to start implementing ethnic regional autonomy, and what the specific content and organizational forms of ethnic regional autonomy are, were first tried and tested in Inner Mongolia by Ulanfu and his comrades.

After the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the political situation in Inner Mongolia, like the rest of the country, was extremely complex. It faced a unique international environment, the life-and-death struggle between domestic revolution and counter-revolution, and the different choices and disagreements among various political forces within the Mongolian nation regarding the development path of their own nation. Following the instructions of the Party Central Committee, Ulanfu and his comrades started by leading and mobilizing the people of Inner Mongolia to launch the autonomy movement. On November 25, 1945, they convened the Inner Mongolia Alliance and Banner Representatives Conference in Zhangjiakou, deciding to establish the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Front. Ulanfu was elected as the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Autonomous Movement United Front. The Autonomous Movement United Front was a united front organization led by the Communist Party of China, uniting people from various ethnic groups and strata in Inner Mongolia; before the establishment of the new revolutionary government, it was also an organization with certain governmental qualities. In fact, it was a transitional government before the establishment of the autonomous government. In the process of deeply mobilizing the masses to launch the autonomy movement, Ulanfu, following the instructions of the Party Central Committee, insisted on the leadership of the Communist Party of China, insisted on the policy of ethnic regional autonomy, insisted on national unity, and opposed separatism. He successfully convened two important conferences in the history of the Inner Mongolia revolution: one was the "April 3" conference held in Chengde on April 3, 1946, which united all revolutionary forces in Inner Mongolia, unified the autonomy movements in the eastern and western parts of Inner Mongolia, greatly promoted the development of the autonomy movement, and quickly created a new situation of unity and solidarity under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The other was the "May 1" conference of the Inner Mongolia People's Representatives held in Ulanhot in 1947, known as the "May 1" conference. It was at this conference that the "Government Work Guidelines of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government" and the "Temporary Organizational Outline of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government" were adopted, the Provisional Council was elected, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government was elected through the Provisional Council, with Ulanfu as the chairman of the autonomous government. It was this "May 1" conference that announced the birth of China's first ethnic autonomous region. The birth of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region created an example for the correct solution of the ethnic issue after the founding of the People's Republic of China.

The government work guidelines and organizational outline issued by the "May 1" conference, in response to the basic characteristics of China's ethnic relations and the historical and real situation of the Inner Mongolia region, specifically regulated the main contents of the ethnic regional autonomy system advocated by the Communist Party of China for the first time: First, the autonomous government is a government of ethnic unity with the Mongolian nationality as the main body, uniting all ethnic groups within the region, and a regional democratic government of all strata of the Mongolian and Han nationalities. This autonomous government practices "high autonomy." Second, the autonomous government takes the Inner Mongolia Alliance and Banner as the autonomous region, practicing autonomy within a unified China, and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is a component of China. Third, the autonomous government and its subordinate Alliance and Banner governments practice the organizational principle of democratic centralism, elected by the Mongolian and other ethnic peoples, with the Council as the power organ; the autonomous government is elected by the Council and is the "highest administrative organ" of Inner Mongolia. Fourth, the autonomous government has the right to build and develop the army of the Inner Mongolia people (this was decided under the situation where the liberation war was still ongoing at that time, and later evolved into the relevant provisions of the Constitution and the Law on Ethnic Regional Autonomy regarding the establishment of public security forces to maintain local order), the right to develop economic and cultural education undertakings, and within the scope of the laws of the revolutionary government of China, "may formulate and promulgate single laws," etc. The establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government turned the ethnic regional autonomy policy of the Communist Party of China into reality, and the regulations of the government work guidelines and organizational outline made China's ethnic regional autonomy system take shape.

II. Creating and Summarizing Rich Experiences in Implementing Ethnic Regional Autonomy

Comrade Ulanfu was not only one of the leaders of the state's ethnic work but also the main Party, government, and military leader of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. From 1947 to 1966, over nearly 20 years, the democratic revolution, socialist transformation, and various construction undertakings in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were all carried out under Ulanfu's organization and leadership. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was created in the midst of the smoke of the liberation war and a complex political environment and developed and grew stronger under the difficult conditions of the early days of national liberation. Ulanfu insisted on starting from the ethnic and regional characteristics of the Inner Mongolia region, overcoming numerous difficulties, creatively implementing and practicing the Party's ethnic regional autonomy policy, combining Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought with the realities of Inner Mongolia, uniting and leading the Mongolian and Han people of the entire region, and achieving great victories in the socialist revolution and construction. He created rich experiences in how to implement ethnic regional autonomy.

Ulanfu paid great attention to summarizing the experiences of Inner Mongolia in implementing regional autonomy and also valued the experiences of other autonomous regions established nationwide. During Ulanfu's tenure as the leader of Inner Mongolia, there were three large-scale summaries of the work of the autonomous region: the first was in 1952, based on the unified arrangement of the Central Committee for Nationalities Affairs, summarizing the experiences of the five-year establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region; the second was in 1957, summarizing the experiences of the ten-year establishment of the autonomous region; the third was in 1966, preparing to summarize the experiences of the twenty-year establishment of the autonomous region, but the summary was interrupted due to the outbreak of the Cultural Revolution. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was recognized by the Party Central Committee and the State Council in 1957 as a model autonomous region nationwide, and the experiences here played an important role in enriching and gradually perfecting China's ethnic regional autonomy system.

The experiences of Inner Mongolia in implementing regional autonomy, together with the experiences of other ethnic autonomous regions nationwide, were first concentrated in the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China" formulated in 1952. In the report to the Central People's Government Council on August 8, 1952, titled "Report on the Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China," Ulanfu, based on the experiences of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and various autonomous regions nationwide, scientifically expounded on issues such as what the ethnic regional autonomy of China is, the ethnic composition of autonomous regions, the autonomous organs and rights of autonomous regions, and the principles of leadership by higher-level people's governments over autonomous regions. All of these were fixed by the state's laws and became the most basic contents of the state's ethnic regional autonomy system. For example, the "Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference" in 1949 only generally stipulated that "ethnic regional autonomy should be implemented in areas where ethnic minorities reside," but did not provide specific explanations of what ethnic regional autonomy is. In Ulanfu's aforementioned report, it was clearly proposed that "ethnic regional autonomy is the basic policy of Chairman Mao in using Marxism-Leninism to solve China's ethnic issues. Ethnic regional autonomy is the regional autonomy within the territory of the People's Republic of China, under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, advancing along the general path of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Common Program, based on the areas where ethnic minorities reside. Based on this general principle and premise, all ethnic minorities residing together have the right to implement ethnic regional autonomy, establish autonomous regions and autonomous organs, and manage their internal affairs according to the wishes of the majority of their ethnic people and leaders who have connections with the people. This is the right of ethnic minorities to be masters of their own house."

The decade of turmoil caused great damage to ethnic regional autonomy, making Ulanfu keenly aware of the importance of comprehensively summarizing and affirming the Party's ethnic regional autonomy policy. He vigorously promoted and presided over the National Border Defense Work Conference in 1979, and on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, delivered an important report, solemnly reaffirming the Party's various ethnic policies, especially the ethnic regional autonomy policy. In 1981, on the occasion of celebrating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, Ulanfu further summarized the experiences of both positive and negative aspects of implementing ethnic regional autonomy over the more than 30 years since the founding of the nation, and published the article "The Brilliant Course of Ethnic Regional Autonomy," systematically and comprehensively expounding on three issues: first, the Party's ethnic regional autonomy policy is the basic policy for correctly solving China's ethnic issues; second, the achievements and lessons of promoting ethnic regional autonomy; third, adhering to the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy and striving for the new tasks of the new era. This is an important theoretical work on ethnic regional autonomy since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and it has important guiding significance for adhering to the system of ethnic regional autonomy. Many profound arguments in the article have been praised by many comrades in the ethnic theory circles. For example, on the issue of why China can only adopt the ethnic regional autonomy policy and not other methods, Ulanfu, from the six aspects of the characteristics of China's ethnic relations, deeply argued. These characteristics are: first, the long-term existence of a centralized unified state is the historical basis for implementing regional autonomy; second, the situation of ethnic intermingling and coexistence is a favorable condition for implementing ethnic regional autonomy; third, since the Opium War, China's social nature and international environment have determined that ethnic unity is a prerequisite for ethnic liberation, and maintaining national unity is a prerequisite for ensuring ethnic freedom; fourth, the correct leadership of a unified proletarian party has formed the core force for implementing ethnic regional autonomy within a unified state; fifth, the long-term common revolutionary struggle of the peoples of all ethnic groups has established the political foundation for implementing ethnic regional autonomy; sixth, the uneven distribution of resources and economic development have determined that implementing ethnic regional autonomy within a unified state is an important guarantee for achieving common prosperity among ethnic groups. Based on the above six aspects, Ulanfu pointed out that implementing ethnic regional autonomy in China is a "historical choice," which "conforms to the national conditions and the will of the people."

III. Contributions to the Legal Construction of Ethnic Regional Autonomy

Ulanfu attached great importance to the legal construction of China's ethnic affairs. As mentioned earlier, the earliest batch of autonomy regulations promulgated during the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947 was formulated under Ulanfu's leadership. In the early years after the founding of the nation, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government promulgated a series of single regulations based on local realities, such as the "Draft of Several Temporary Regulations on Personnel Management by the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region People's Government" in March 1951; the "Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Marriage Registration Regulations" in July 1951; the "Temporary Regulations on Livestock Tax in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1953" and the "Regulations on the Number of Representatives of the People's Representatives at Various Levels in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" in the same year, etc. After the promulgation of the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China" in 1954, with the approval of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the "Regulations on the Organization of the People's Representatives at Various Levels and the People's Committees at Various Levels in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region" was promptly promulgated in November 1955. This was the first single regulation promulgated by an ethnic autonomous region in China according to the Constitution.

The disaster of the decade of turmoil made Ulanfu keenly aware of the serious harm caused by the lack of ethnic legal construction to all ethnic minorities. In October 1980, at the second session of the Fifth National People's Congress Nationalities Committee, Ulanfu delivered an important report titled "Seriously Do a Good Job in Ethnic Legislation," comprehensively expounding on the importance of ethnic legislation work, and calling on cadres at all levels to attach importance to ethnic legislation work. Ulanfu clearly pointed out: "The ethnic legislation work we need to do is legislation work to strengthen ethnic unity, consolidate national unity, and promote ethnic prosperity, which is an important aspect of socialist legal construction." He also specifically proposed that ethnic legislation work includes three aspects: first, legislation to ensure that ethnic minorities residing together enjoy sufficient autonomy rights; second, legislation to ensure that ethnic minorities residing scattered enjoy equal democratic rights; third, legislation to ensure that ethnic minorities enjoy equal participation in the management of state affairs. In this report, Ulanfu emphasized that ethnic legislation work must adhere to seeking truth from facts, and must truly guarantee the equal rights and autonomy rights of ethnic minorities; he also specially emphasized the need to maintain the authority of socialist legal construction related to ethnic issues, which requires that ethnic laws and regulations must have sufficient clarity and seriousness, and requires strengthening the propaganda and supervision of ethnic legal construction.

Ulanfu particularly valued the legal construction of ethnic regional autonomy. In the aforementioned article "The Brilliant Course of Ethnic Regional Autonomy," Ulanfu deeply expounded on the importance of strengthening the legal construction of ethnic regional autonomy. He pointed out: "Years of lessons have told us that without the guarantee of a perfect and sound socialist legal system, the ethnic regional autonomy policy is difficult to implement. Now we are strengthening the legal construction of ethnic regional autonomy to use laws to confirm the requirements of the ethnic regional autonomy policy, and by the state organs to use coercive force to ensure the implementation of the ethnic regional autonomy policy. Only by strengthening the legal construction of ethnic regional autonomy, strengthening the propaganda of ethnic legal construction, and resolutely acting according to the legal provisions, can the ethnic regional autonomy policy be truly implemented." Ulanfu emphasized that strengthening the legal construction of ethnic regional autonomy is "both an urgent task and a long-term plan."

Ulanfu believed that the "Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy" promulgated in 1952 played an important role in promoting ethnic regional autonomy in the early years of the founding of the nation. However, some of the contents in this law can no longer meet the current needs. He believed that our country urgently needs, based on the summary of the experiences of promoting ethnic regional autonomy over the past 30 years, to formulate a new law on ethnic regional autonomy according to the new situation. The "Law of the People's Republic of China on Ethnic Regional Autonomy" was initiated by Ulanfu to the Party Central Committee and the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and he presided over its drafting. From 1981 to 1984, over four years, Ulanfu was personally involved in every aspect of the drafting of the ethnic regional autonomy law, from the composition of the drafting team, the structure and arrangement of the draft, the deployment of the work plan for each stage, the convening of seminars, to how to widely solicit opinions from all parties, etc. In the summer of 1981, Ulanfu, while recuperating in Beidaihe, led the drafting team members to work with him. Over the course of a whole month, he presided over the drafting meetings every morning, expounding on his rich experiences and valuable opinions on the ethnic regional autonomy policy, and carefully listening to the drafting team's thoughts on the law, allowing the attendees to speak freely. The earliest foundation of the ethnic regional autonomy law was formed during this period. Until the law was submitted to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress for deliberation, 17 drafts had been drafted, and each draft was carefully reviewed by Ulanfu word by word. The ethnic regional autonomy law is an important basic law for the state to adjust ethnic relations. In the drafting process, it was necessary to coordinate the relationships of all parties and unify the understanding of all parties. The work volume and difficulty were both very large. The solution of many important issues and the drafting of some important articles were personally handled by Ulanfu with the relevant comrades. To formulate the ethnic regional autonomy law, Ulanfu, despite his advanced age and poor health, worked tirelessly, truly dedicating himself to the cause.

After the promulgation of the ethnic regional autonomy law, Ulanfu also did a great deal of work to promote the propaganda, education, and implementation of the law. He wrote many articles, gave reports, and made television speeches, loudly calling for the promotion of the ethnic regional autonomy law and the implementation of the ethnic regional autonomy law.

Let us, by seriously implementing the ethnic regional autonomy law, doing a good job in ethnic work, accelerating the development of economic and cultural construction in ethnic regions, and realizing the common prosperity of all ethnic groups, commemorate Comrade Ulanfu.

    乌兰夫与民族区域自治
    李贵
    乌兰夫同志与世长辞了，但他毕生为之奋战的事业将永远铭刻于各族人民的心中。
    乌兰夫同志作为党的民族工作的杰出领导人和卓越的民族领袖，他的名字，是同我国的民族工作，特别是同我国的民族区域自治制度紧紧地联结在一起的。只要回顾一下我国民族区域自治制度的形成、发展和逐步完善的历史，就可以鲜明地显示出乌兰夫同志从理论到实践对我国民族区域自治制度作出巨大贡献的光辉历程。
    一、建立第一个民族自治区
    内蒙古自治区是我国的第一个民族自治区，始建于1947年5月1日。许多老同志都知道，这是乌兰夫同志同从延安来的一批蒙汉各族战友，根据党中央的指示，把马克思列宁主义民族理论和我们党的民族政策与内蒙古的实际相结合，团结蒙古族各阶层的革命力量，在排除万难中所创建起来的。在我国少数民族聚居的地方实行区域自治，维护国家统一和民族团结，这是党中央、毛主席的决策。但是，实行民族区域自治究竟从何着手，民族区域自治的具体内容和组织形式是什么，这是由乌兰夫等同志首先从内蒙古试点起步的。
    抗日战争结束后，内蒙古的政治形势，也同全国一样，十分错综复杂。这里面临着特殊的国际环境，面临着国内革命和反革命之间的殊死争夺，还面临着蒙古民族内部各派政治势力之间对于本民族发展道路问题的不同选择和意见分歧。根据党中央的指示，乌兰夫等同志从领导和发动内蒙古人民开展自治运动着手，于1945年11月25日在张家口召开了内蒙古各盟旗代表大会，决定成立内蒙古自治运动联合会，乌兰夫同志当选为自治运动联合会执行委员会主席。自治运动联合会是中国共产党领导下的团结内蒙古各民族各阶层人士的统一战线性质的群众革命团体；在新的革命政权成立以前，它还是一个具有一定的政权性质的组织。实际上，它正是在自治政权成立以前的过渡政权。在深入发动群众开展自治运动的过程中，乌兰夫同志按照党中央的指示，坚持中国共产党的领导，坚持民族区域自治政策，坚持国家的统一，反对分裂，成功地召开了两次在内蒙古革命史上有着重要意义的会议：一次是1946年4月3日在承德举行的“四·三”会议，团结了内蒙古的一切革命力量，将内蒙古东部和西部的自治运动统一起来，极大地推动了自治运动的发展，使内蒙古迅速出现了在中国共产党领导下的团结统一的新局面。另一次是1947年在乌兰浩特举行的被称为“五·一”大会的内蒙古人民代表会议，正是在这次大会上通过了《内蒙古自治政府施政纲领》和《内蒙古自治政府暂行组织大纲》，选出了临时参议会，并经临时参议会选出内蒙古自治政府，乌兰夫同志当选为自治政府的主席。正是这个“五·一”大会宣告了我国第一个民族自治区的诞生。内蒙古自治区的诞生，为尔后成立的中华人民共和国正确解决民族问题创造了一个范例。
    “五·一”大会所颁布的自治政府的施政纲领和组织大纲，针对我国民族关系的基本特点和内蒙古地区的历史和现实情况，第一次具体地规范了中国共产党所主张实行的民族区域自治制度的主要内容：第一，自治政府是以蒙古民族为主体，联合区内各民族的民族团结的政府，是蒙汉各民族各阶层的区域性的民主政府，这个自治政府实行“高度自治”。第二，自治政府以内蒙古各盟、旗为自治区域，是在统一的中国之内实行自治，内蒙古自治区是中国的组成部分。第三，自治政府及所属盟旗政府实行民主集中制的组织原则，由蒙古族及其他各族人民选举参议会，参议会是权力机关；由参议会选举自治政府，自治政府是内蒙古的“最高行政机关”。第四，自治政府有权建设和发展内蒙古人民的军队（这是在当时解放战争正在进行的形势下决定的，以后演变为宪法和民族区域自治法关于建立维护地方治安的公安部队的有关条文），有权发展经济事业和教育文化事业，以及在不抵触中国革命政府法律范围内，“得制定公布单行法”等。内蒙古自治政府的成立，使中国共产党的民族区域自治政策变成了现实，自治政府的施政纲领和组织大纲的规定，使我国的民族区域自治制度初具规模。
    二、创造和总结实行民族区域自治的丰富经验
    乌兰夫同志既是国家的民族工作领导人之一，还特别是内蒙古自治区的主要的党政军负责人。从1947年到1966年的近20年间，内蒙古自治区的民主革命、社会主义改造以及各项建设事业，都是在乌兰夫同志的组织和领导下进行的。内蒙古自治区创建于解放战争的硝烟和复杂的政治环境中，发展、壮大于全国解放初期的困难条件下。乌兰夫同志坚持从内蒙古地区的民族特点和地区特点出发，克服重重困难，创造性地执行和实践党的民族区域自治政策，把马列主义毛泽东思想和内蒙古的实际相结合，团结并带领全区蒙汉各族人民群众，在社会主义革命和建设中，取得了重大胜利，在如何实行民族区域自治问题上创造了丰富的经验。
    乌兰夫同志十分重视总结内蒙古实行区域自治的经验，也很重视全国其他相继建立起来的自治地区的经验。在乌兰夫同志主持内蒙古的工作期间，对自治区的大规模工作总结有过三次，第一次是1952年根据中央民族事务委员会的统一部署，总结内蒙古自治区成立五周年的经验；第二次是1957年总结自治区成立十周年的经验；第三次是1966年着手总结自治区成立二十周年的经验，因为“文化大革命”的发生，这次经验总结中途停顿下来。内蒙古自治区，曾于1957年为党中央和国务院确认为全国的模范自治区，这里的经验，对于充实和逐步完善我国的民族区域自治制度，起了重要作用。
    内蒙古实行区域自治的经验，同全国其他民族自治地方的经验一起，先是集中地体现在1952年制定的《中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要》中。在1952年8月8日向中央人民政府委员会所作的《关于中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要的报告》里，乌兰夫同志根据内蒙古自治区和全国各自治地区的经验，对什么是中国的民族区域自治问题，自治地区的民族组成问题，自治地区的自治机关和自治权利问题，以及自治地区内的民族关系和上级人民政府对自治地区的领导原则等问题，作了科学的论述。所有这些都用国家的法律固定了下来，成为国家的民族区域自治制度的最基本的内容。譬如，1949年的《中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领》只原则地规定：“各少数民族聚居的地区，应实行民族的区域自治”，对于什么叫民族区域自治，当时还没有作出具体说明。在乌兰夫同志的上述报告中明确地提出：“民族的区域自治是毛主席运用马克思、列宁主义解决中国民族问题的基本政策。民族的区域自治是中华人民共和国领土之内的、在中央人民政府统一领导下的、遵循着中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领总道路前进的、以少数民族聚居区为基础的区域自治。依据这个总原则和大前提，一切聚居的少数民族，都有权利实行民族的区域自治、建立自治区和自治机关，按照本民族大多数人民及与人民有联系的领袖人物的志愿，管理本民族的内部事务。这就是少数民族当家作主的权利。”这些内容已分别在《民族区域自治实施纲要》的有关条文中作出了规定。
    十年浩劫对民族区域自治的破坏，使乌兰夫同志痛感全面总结和肯定党的民族区域自治政策的重要。他大力促进和主持召开了1979年的全国边防工作会议，并代表党中央、国务院作了重要报告，严肃地重申了党的各项民族政策，特别是民族区域自治政策。1981年，在庆祝中国共产党成立60周年之际，乌兰夫同志又进一步总结了建国30多年来实行民族区域自治正反两方面的经验，发表了《民族区域自治的光辉历程》一文，系统地、全面地论述了3个问题：一是党的民族区域自治政策是正确解决我国民族问题的基本政策；二是推行民族区域自治的成效和教训；三是坚持实行民族区域自治，为完成新时期的新任务而奋斗。这是中共十一届三中全会以来，从理论上全面论述民族区域自治的重要论著，对坚持民族区域自治制度具有重要的指导意义。文章的许多精辟论述，一直为民族理论界许多同志所称颂。譬如，对我国为什么只能采取民族区域自治政策，而不能采取其他办法的问题，乌兰夫同志从我国民族关系的六个方面的特点，深刻地作了论证。这些特点是：第一，中央集权的统一国家长期存在，是实行区域自治的历史基础；第二，民族错居杂处和相依共存的状况，是实行民族区域自治的有利条件；第三，鸦片战争以来中国的社会性质和国际环境，决定了民族联合是民族解放的前提，维护国家统一是确保民族自由的前提；第四，统一的无产阶级政党的正确领导，形成了在统一国家中实行民族区域自治的核心力量；第五，各民族人民长期的共同革命斗争，创立了实行民族区域自治的政治基础；第六，资源分布和经济发展的不平衡性，决定了在统一国家中实行民族区域自治是实现民族共同繁荣的重要保证。根据以上六个方面的条件，乌兰夫同志指出：在我国实行民族区域自治，是“历史的抉择”，它“合乎国情，顺乎民心”。
    三、对民族区域实行法制建设的贡献
    乌兰夫同志十分重视我国的民族法制建设。前面已经提到，1947年内蒙古自治区成立时期所颁布的我国最早的一批自治法规，就是在乌兰夫同志主持下制定的。建国初年，内蒙古自治区人民政府就根据本地的实际情况，颁布过一系列单行法规，譬如1951年3月的《内蒙古自治区人民政府关于人事管理上的几项暂行规定（草案）》；1951年7月的《内蒙古自治区婚姻登记办法》；1953年7月的《内蒙古自治区1953年牧业税暂行条例》以及同年的《关于内蒙古自治区各级人民代表大会代表名额的规定》等。1954年《中华人民共和国宪法》颁布以后，经全国人民代表大会常务委员会批准，1955年11月很快就颁布了《内蒙古自治区各级人民代表大会和各级人民委员会组织条例》。这是我国民族自治地方按照宪法规定所颁布的第一个单行条例。
    十年浩劫的灾难，使乌兰夫同志深感民族法制不健全给各少数民族带来的严重危害。1980年10月，在第五届全国人大民族委员会第二次会议上，乌兰夫同志作了《认真做好民族立法工作》的重要报告，全面论述了民族立法工作的重要性，号召各级干部要重视民族立法工作。乌兰夫同志明确指出：“我们所要做的民族立法工作，是加强民族团结、巩固祖国统一和促进民族繁荣的立法工作，是社会主义法制建设的重要方面。”他还具体提出民族立法工作包括三个方面的内容，即：“第一是关于保障聚居的少数民族享有充足的自治权利的立法，第二是关于保障散居的少数民族成份享有平等的民主权利的立法，第三是关于保障少数民族享有平等地参与管理国家事务的立法。”在这个报告中，乌兰夫同志强调指出：民族立法工作要坚持实事求是，要切实保障少数民族的平等权利和自治权利；他还特别强调要维护有关民族问题的社会主义法制的权威，这就要求民族法律法规必须有足够的明确性和严肃性，要求加强民族法制的宣传和监督。
    乌兰夫同志特别重视民族区域自治的法制建设。在上述《民族区域自治的光辉历程》一文里，乌兰夫同志深刻地论述了加强民族区域自治法制建设的重要性。他指出：“多年的教训告诉我们，没有完善而健全的社会主义法制的保障，民族区域自治政策是很难落实的。我们现在加强民族区域自治的法制建设，是要用法律来确认民族区域自治政策的要求，并且由国家机关以强制力来保证民族区域自治政策的贯彻执行。只有加强了民族区域自治的法制建设，加强民族法制宣传，并坚决按法律规定办事，才能真正落实民族区域自治政策。”乌兰夫同志强调指出：加强民族区域自治的法制建设工作，“既是当务之急，也是久安之计”。
    乌兰夫同志认为，1952年颁布的《民族区域自治实施纲要》对建国初年推行民族区域自治起了重要作用。但是，这个法律中的有些内容已经不能满足当前的需要了，他认为我们国家迫切需要在总结30年来推行民族区域自治的经验的基础上，根据当前的新情况，制定出一项关于民族区域自治的新的法律。《中华人民共和国民族区域自治法》就是由乌兰夫同志向党中央和全国人大常务委员会倡议制定，并由他主持起草的。自1981年至1984年的4年间，乌兰夫同志从民族区域自治法起草班子的组成、草案的结构和条文的安排、每一阶段起草工作计划的部署，座谈会的召开，以及如何广泛征求各方面的意见等等，无不事事躬亲。1981年夏，乌兰夫同志在北戴河养病期间，带领起草小组人员随他工作。在整整一个月内，他每天上午都主持起草会议，一面讲述他对民族区域自治政策的丰富经验和宝贵意见，一面仔细听取起草人员对这个法的构思，让到会同志畅所欲言。民族区域自治法的最早的基础就是在这一段工作中形成的。在这个法提交全国人大常务委员会审议时止，共起草过17稿，每一稿都经过乌兰夫同志逐条逐句推敲。民族区域自治法，是国家调整民族关系的重要的基本法，在起草过程中要协调各方面的关系，统一各方面的认识，无论工作量和难度，都是很大的。许多重要问题的解决，以及一些重要条文的撰写，是由乌兰夫同志亲自出面与有关同志商定的。为制定民族区域自治法，乌兰夫同志不顾年高体弱，孜孜不倦，真可谓是鞠躬尽瘁。
    民族区域自治法颁布以后，乌兰夫同志又为这个法的宣传教育和贯彻实施，作了大量大量工作。他多次写文章，作报告和发表电视谈话，大声疾呼，宣传民族区域自治法，推动民族区域自治法的贯彻实施。
    让我们以认真贯彻民族区域自治法，做好民族工作，加速民族地区经济文化建设事业的发展，实现各民族的共同繁荣，来纪念乌兰夫同志。
