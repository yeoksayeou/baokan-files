This year, Shanxi Province's Linyi County experienced unprecedented pest and drought disasters. After the wheat began to sprout and grow, it did not rain for over two months. Red spiders, sap-sucking insects, and complete blight also occurred on a large scale. Unexpectedly, Linyi County, the largest wheat production base in Shanxi Province, achieved a bumper harvest. According to preliminary estimates, the county's 910,000 acres of wheat produced approximately 250 million kilograms, an increase of nearly 20% compared to last year.

Why did Linyi County increase production despite the disasters? Understanding the "Old Man Heaven's" temperament

When talking about the "Old Man Heaven," people often sigh that he is uncooperative, with nine out of ten years experiencing droughts that make it difficult for wheat to produce a good harvest.

Humans cannot directly control the weather, but the leaders of Linyi County do not rely on the heavens for wheat production. Starting last year, they conducted a thorough analysis and study of the relationship between meteorological factors and wheat yield, discovering that as long as the two crucial rains in September and the third lunar month during the wheat growth period are secured, a good harvest is almost guaranteed.

Last year, during the wheat sowing season, September saw less rainfall, making it difficult to sow the wheat. Faced with this situation, the county did not rush to require farmers to sow in dry conditions but repeatedly emphasized the need to ensure adequate soil moisture and sow after watering the land. The entire county seized the opportunity to irrigate 300,000 acres of land, ensuring that all the wheat was sown in moist soil. This year in March, the wheat began to sprout and grow, but encountered a severe drought. The county organized more than 100,000 people to dig canals and divert water from the Yellow River, which played a crucial role in the wheat's high yield. Nurturing the "Earth God's" body

Here, the "Earth God" refers to the wheat fields. After the wheat harvest, Linyi County guided farmers to take care of the land like they would machinery, seizing every opportunity to actively maintain the soil.

As the saying goes, "First heat a bowl of oil, second heat half a bowl, third heat no oil, pre-heat adds oil." This means that the earlier the land is plowed, the better. Based on this farming experience, soon after the summer harvest last year, Linyi County organized more than 3,700 medium and large tractors to work for over a month, completing the plowing of all wheat fields by July 20. Among these, 450,000 acres were plowed to a depth of more than 7 inches, with better timing and quality than in previous years, allowing the wheat fields to relax and recover early. Mastering the "Big Belly's" appetite

As the saying goes, wheat is a big eater, able to eat and drink a lot and work hard. This means that as long as the wheat fields are well-fed and watered, and their appetite is managed to provide the best nutritional components scientifically, the potential for increased production is limitless.

Returning wheat straw to the field can significantly increase soil organic matter. Last year, the county mobilized thousands of households to promote this practice on a large scale. In the past, the application of chemical fertilizers was largely based on experience and was quite arbitrary. Last year, the entire county widely implemented optimized formulas, conducting soil testing and fertilizer application for 500,000 acres. The land was divided into blocks for testing to see what it had and what it lacked, and then the required nutritional amount was calculated based on the yield. Due to the implementation of targeted fertilization, the long-standing tendency of heavy nitrogen and light phosphorus was changed, basically meeting the nutritional needs of wheat growth.

    潜力，蕴藏在科技进步中
    ——临猗县大灾之年小麦稳产高产的启示
    黄江
    今年山西省临猗县的虫灾、旱灾真说得上是人所罕见。小麦返青拔节后，持续两个多月没下雨；红蜘蛛、吸浆虫、全蚀病等又大面积发生。出人意料，临猗县这个山西省最大的小麦生产基地却喜获丰收。据碾打估产，全县91万亩小麦总产达到2.5亿公斤左右，比去年增产近两成。
    为什么临猗县大灾之年不减产反而增产呢？摸准“老天爷”脾气提起“老天爷”，人们常叹它不听话，十年九旱影响小麦难以丰产。
    人类还不能直接呼风唤雨，临猗县的领导在小麦生产上并不听天由命。从去年开始，他们对气象因子同小麦的产量关系进行了认真分析研究，发现小麦生长期内只要能保住9月和农历3月这两场关键雨，就基本丰收在望。
    去年在小麦播种时，9月因雨量偏少，给回茬小麦下种带来困难。面对此情，县上没有急于要求农民干旱下种，而是反复强调必须保证墒情，渗地进行下种。全县抓住时机灌溉土地30万亩，保证回茬小麦都种进了泥窝窝。今年3月，小麦返青拔节又遇上了卡脖大旱，县上先后组织10多万人次下黄河挖渠引水，对小麦丰产起了关键作用。保养“土地爷”身体这里“土地爷”指的是麦田。麦收之后，临猗县引导农民像管护机器一样，抓住空闲时机，积极对土地进行保养。
    俗话说，头伏一碗油，二伏半碗油，三伏没有油，伏前油加油。意思是土地深翻越早越好。从这样的耕作经验出发，去年夏收刚刚结束，临猗县就组织3700多台大中型拖拉机，突击一个多月，在7月20日前把麦田全部耕完，其中深度在7寸以上的达到45万亩，伏耕时间和质量都好于往年，使麦田及早地疏松筋骨、休养生息。掌握“大肚汉”胃口俗话说，小麦是个大肚汉，能吃能喝又能干。这就是说，只要能让麦田吃饱喝足，又注意掌握它的胃口，达到科学供给最佳营养成份，增产的潜力无穷。
    麦草秸秆还田能大量增加土壤有机质，去年县里动员千家万户大面积进行推广。以往施用化肥，相当长时间内都是凭经验，存在着很大盲目性。去年全县普遍推行了优化配方，共测土供肥50万亩。对土地分块化验，看有啥、缺啥，然后再根据产量分别计算出所需营养量。由于实行了抓药开方，对症施肥，改变了长期以来重氮轻磷的倾向，基本上符合了小麦生长需求。
