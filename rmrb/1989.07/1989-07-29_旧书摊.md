Books, although they may fade and become brittle under the influence of light, air, temperature, and humidity, retain the thoughts and knowledge they contain, which can shine for a long time, even from generation to generation. For seekers of knowledge and book collectors, many old books are not merely waste paper. Good books still possess an "immortal essence" and remain an important social asset. Therefore, many countries around the world place great importance on the old book industry to meet the needs of readers at various levels.

The Soviet Union has over two hundred publishing houses, releasing 230 new books daily with a total circulation of 5.7 million copies. They publish 80,000 titles annually, with a total output exceeding 2 billion copies. They also have over 4,000 points for buying and selling old books. In 1981, the total value of old books bought and sold was 58.4 million rubles, and by 1985, this figure had reached 1 billion rubles, equivalent to the total output of three major Soviet publishing houses. Soviet people are accustomed to exchanging old books, selling those they no longer wish to keep and buying cheaper second-hand books. Bookstores also offer book exchange services, charging a commission to balance the surplus and deficit of book owners. The old bookstores in Belarus are well-managed, giving a new life to a large number of old books. They buy bestsellers at their original price and then sell them at a 20% markup, with very good results. In Moscow, 850 bookstores have old book stalls, and the city has 37 book exchange stations, exchanging about 100,000 books annually.

France has over 400 publishing houses, publishing more than 30,000 titles annually, with a business turnover of 9 billion francs. From cities to rural areas, bookstores, book kiosks, and book sections in shops are countless, and cheap book stalls are everywhere, making it very convenient for customers to buy new and old books. Along the Seine River in Paris, there is a famous old book stall area called Saint-Michel, which is as rich in old books as the book market in Tokyo's Kanda. These old book stalls are favorite spots for poor students and scholars from various countries.

In London, England, Foyles Bookshop is the world's largest retail bookstore, with a business area of 55 acres. It has 15 kilometers of bookshelves, all of which are "reaching the sky," containing over 3 million books and magazines. The bookstore discards 4 tons of books every week, and these discarded books are a valuable source for the British old book industry. Hay-on-Wye, a small town of 1,300 people at the border of England and Wales, has become one of the world's old book trading centers. Every week, trucks full of old books enter the town, and at the same time, large quantities of old book parcels are sent out domestically and internationally. At its peak, the town had 3 million books in stock, selling 1 million books annually. In the 1960s, Boon, a university graduate who couldn't find a job, bought several private libraries' books at low prices and brought them back to his hometown, Hay-on-Wye, to open an old bookstore. Unexpectedly, the business was very successful. Inspired by him, old bookstores in Hay-on-Wye sprang up like mushrooms, bringing new life to the once-lifeless town, making Hay-on-Wye a tourist attraction and drawing tens of thousands of book lovers from home and abroad.

    旧书摊
    书籍虽然在光照、空气、温湿度等环境因素的影响下会褪色、变脆，但是它所记载的思想、知识却能长时间的，甚至世世代代的闪光。对于求知者、对于藏书迷说来，很多旧书并不等于废纸，好的书仍“具有不朽的本质”，仍然是社会的一种重要财富，所以世界很多国家都十分重视旧书业的经营，以满足多层次读者的需求。
    苏联有二百家出版社，每天出版二百三十种新书，总发行量达五百七十万册，每年出版图书八万种，出版总量在二十亿册以上。他们还有旧书收购和出售网点四千多个，一九八一年收购及销售旧书总额为五千八百四十万卢布，一九八五年已达一亿卢布，相当于苏联三大出版社的总产值。苏联人习惯于旧书交流，将不想保存的旧书卖出去，再买回便宜的二手货。书店还开展图书交换业务，酌收佣金，调剂持书者双方的余缺。苏联白俄罗斯的旧书店经营有方，使大量旧书获得了新生；他们按原价收购畅销书，然后加价百分之二十售出，这一作法效果颇为理想。莫斯科八百五十家书店都设有旧书摊，全市还有三十七家图书交换站，一年约交换图书十万册。
    法国有大小出版社四百余家，每年出版图书三万多种，营业额达九十亿法郎。从城市到农村书店书亭、商店中的图书专柜不计其数，而廉价书摊更触目皆是，顾客购买新旧图书都极为方便。巴黎塞纳河畔数公里长的河滨地带，是闻名于世的圣米歇尔旧书摊区，其旧书丰富程度，不亚于日本东京的神田街书市，这些旧书摊是穷学子和各国“寒士”最爱光顾之处。
    英国伦敦的福尔士书店是世界最大的零售书店，营业面积达五十五亩，它有长十五公里的书架，而书架都是“顶天立地”的，有超过三百万本的读物和杂志；每星期内书店要淘汰重达四吨的书，而这些淘汰下来的书籍，正是英国旧书业宝贵的货源之一。英格兰和威尔士交界处的海恩韦，是个一千三百人的小镇，如今已成为世界旧书业的交易中心之一。每周都有装满旧书的卡车进入镇里，同时也有大量的旧书邮包发往国内外。全镇存书最多时达三百万册，年销售一百万册。六十年代大学毕业的布恩，找不到职业，以低价买下了几家私人图书馆的书籍，运回家乡海恩韦，开起了旧书店，殊不知生意格外兴隆。在他的刺激下，海恩韦的旧书店如雨后春笋，迅速发展起来，给毫无生气的小镇带来了勃勃生机，使海恩韦成了游览中心，吸引了国内外成千上万的读书人。
