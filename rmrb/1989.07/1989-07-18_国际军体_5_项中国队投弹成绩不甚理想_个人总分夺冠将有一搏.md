The International Military Pentathlon saw some unexpected developments today. The Chinese team's performance in the shot put was disappointing, and their overall score was not satisfactory. Although the team maintains a significant lead in the overall standings, the individual scores are being closely contested, with Brazilian athlete Bandeira hot on the heels of the Chinese competitors. Tomorrow's competition for the individual championship is expected to be intense, and the Chinese athletes will have a chance to fight for the top spot.

This morning, the weather in Caracas was poor, with intermittent rain, which affected the performance of the Chinese athletes. Their results were notably lower than their usual training levels, especially in accuracy, where they made more mistakes. In contrast, Brazilian star Bandeira performed exceptionally well, scoring a perfect bullseye and losing no points, while also achieving good results in distance. As a result, his individual score not only surpassed yesterday's second-place holder, Yang Chunyi, by 44.86 points but also closely approached the current leader, Liang Xifen, trailing by just 2.64 points, temporarily holding the second position. Tomorrow's competition for the individual championship will be very intense. However, the rest of the Brazilian team's performance today was not impressive, so our team still maintains a 203.86-point lead over the Brazilian team, making our team's prospects for the team championship relatively optimistic.

After the competition, team leader Bai Yueyou analyzed that while weather factors played a role, the psychological factors of some of our team members were likely the main reason for the poor performance. In such major competitions, excessive psychological pressure and unstable emotions can be significant factors preventing athletes from performing at their best.

    国际军体5项中国队投弹成绩不甚理想
    个人总分夺冠将有一搏
    本报加拉加斯7月17日电  记者朱满庭报道：国际军体5项今天赛场突起波澜，中国队在投弹中发挥失常，成绩不甚理想。团体总分虽以较大优势领先，个人总积分却被巴西好手班德拉逼近，明天个人冠军的争夺进入白热化，我选手将有一搏。
    今天上午加拉加斯天气不好，雨时紧时歇，中国队选手发挥有些失常，成绩明显低于平时训练水平，特别在投准时失误较多。相反，对中国选手个人争冠威胁最大的巴西名将班德拉的表现却很出色，投准得了满环，一分未失，投远成绩也不错。这样他的个人积分不仅超出昨天排名第2的杨春义44.86分，而且直逼目前仍保持第1位的梁锡芬，仅以2.64分之差，暂居第2。明天个人冠军的争夺将十分激烈。不过巴西队其他选手今天的成绩也不算好，所以我队仍以203.86分之差保持着对巴西队的优势，我队团体夺冠前景较乐观。
    白月友领队赛后分析说，天气因素固然有一些，但我队一些队员的心理因素恐怕是影响成绩的主要原因。在这种大赛中，心理负担过重、情绪稳定不下来，可能是水平发挥不出来的重要原因。
