In the Sino-American joint venture Shanghai Fokker, three retired workers enthusiastically shared with us their positive experiences with the Shanghai Municipal Insurance Company's pension insurance. These three elderly individuals now receive their monthly living expenses, medical fees, and even funeral and bereavement allowances for their families from the insurance company, ensuring lifelong security. Previously, these three individuals had transferred from state-owned enterprises to joint ventures and were worried about not having labor insurance upon retirement. Now, they are completely at ease.

The wages in foreign-funded enterprises across various regions are generally higher than those in state-owned enterprises and public institutions, which makes Chinese employees in these enterprises satisfied. However, the issue of pension insurance has remained unresolved for a long time, often deterring potential Chinese job applicants, especially experienced managers and highly skilled older workers. In response to the situation, the Shanghai Municipal Insurance Company started offering pension insurance for Chinese employees in foreign-funded enterprises within the city in 1986. This initiative marked the introduction of a new insurance scheme nationwide. This insurance stipulates that foreign-funded enterprises deduct a portion from the labor service fees, based on a certain percentage of the total wages, to be paid monthly as insurance premiums. The insurance company then accumulates these funds and, upon the employees' retirement, pays out the pension insurance benefits on a per-person basis. Over the past three years, 228 foreign-funded enterprises in the city, with 37,000 Chinese employees, have enrolled in this pension insurance program with the insurance company, covering almost all the foreign-funded enterprises that have started production and operations.

The most apparent benefit of this insurance for foreign-funded enterprises is in attracting talent. The mid- to high-level managers and technical backbone that foreign-funded enterprises need are mostly recruited from state-owned enterprises, public institutions, government agencies, and some collective enterprises. These individuals are generally older and nearing retirement or retirement age, and will soon be eligible for labor insurance. While the appeal of working in foreign-funded enterprises is high, there are also concerns, primarily about old-age security. The introduction of pension insurance has effectively addressed these concerns, removing obstacles to talent recruitment.

For the employees within foreign-funded enterprises, this pension insurance serves as a cohesive force. This is particularly evident among older employees. Approximately 70% of the younger employees in the enterprise will not be able to retire by the time the joint venture or cooperative period ends. Initially, they had reservations about paying insurance premiums. To address this, the Municipal Insurance Company stipulates that for employees who cannot retire by the end of the joint venture or cooperative period, upon the expiration of the period, 10% of the total insurance premiums paid by the individual will be refunded in a lump sum as compensation, with the remaining amount transferred to the new unit along with the employee to continue the pension insurance fund. This way, both young and old employees are satisfied.

Opening up to the outside world and attracting foreign investment requires creating a good investment environment. The pension insurance for Chinese employees in foreign-funded enterprises offered by the Shanghai Municipal Insurance Company is a successful initiative to improve the investment soft environment. The general manager of Fokker, Mr. Yang, told us, "This beneficial measure that motivates employees is welcomed not only by Chinese managers but also by foreign managers."

    上海首创一项新险种
    三资企业养老保险受欢迎
    本报记者　梅洪如
    在中美合资的上海福克思波罗公司，三位退休老职工兴奋地向我们介绍享受上海市保险公司养老保险的良好感受。这三位老人现在每月生活费、医疗费以及百年后的丧葬费、家属抚恤费均由保险公司负担，终身有靠。原先，三人从国营企业转到合资企业，直担心退休后没有劳保，现在完全放心了。
    各地三资企业的工资普遍高于国营企事业单位，这点使三资企业中的中国职工满意。但是，养老保险久未解决，又常使有希望应聘的中国职工，特别是管理经验丰富、技术较高的老职工望而却步。上海市保险公司顺应形势需要，从一九八六年起为市内三资企业里中国职工开办了养老保险。这在全国首创了一项新险种。这项保险规定，由三资企业从劳务费中拿出一部分，按工资总额一定比例逐月缴纳保险费。保险公司将这笔资金储存起来，待职工退休时，按人头给付养老保险费。三年来，全市已有二百二十八家三资企业、三万七千名中国职工向保险公司办理了这项养老保险，投保面几乎涵盖了所有已投产和营业的三资企业。
    这项保险带给三资企业最明显的好处表现在吸引人才方面。三资企业所需要的中、高层管理人员和技术骨干，大都要从国营企事业单位、机关和一些集体企业吸收。这些人年龄都比较大，离退休和离休期不远，将要享受劳保。到三资企业去，吸引力大，困惑也不小，主要是老有所养问题。开办养老保险，一举消除了人们的后顾之忧，消除了原来吸收人才的阻力。
    养老保险对于三资企业内部的职工来说，则是一个凝聚力。这在老职工身上不难理解。企业内大约有百分之七十的年轻职工，在合资、合作期满时还不能退休，他们起初对缴保险费有意见。市保险公司为此规定，凡到合资、合作期满不能退休的职工，到期按本人历年所缴保险费总额的百分之十，一次性返还给个人作补偿，余额随职工转入新单位，续作养老保险基金。这样，青、老年职工都满意。
    对外开放，吸引外资，需要创造良好的投资环境。上海市保险公司开办的三资企业中国职工养老保险，是改善投资软环境的一个成功创举。福克思波罗公司杨总经理告诉我们：“这种利于调动职工积极性的好事，不仅中方经理欢迎，外方经理也很欢迎。”
