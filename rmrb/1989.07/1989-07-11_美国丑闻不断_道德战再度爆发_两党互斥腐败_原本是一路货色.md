Xinhua News Agency, Washington, July 10th.

Recent revelations by American news organizations about the collusion between former officials of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Republican Party figures, and real estate developers have once again brought the issue of corruption in the U.S. to the forefront of public attention.

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is responsible for providing housing for low-income individuals. However, during the Reagan administration, HUD became a hub for political dealings. Real estate developers, eager to secure lucrative contracts for building and maintaining low-income housing, hired or assigned so-called "influential" figures, such as Reagan's election supporters, former cabinet members, and Republican congressmen, to lobby HUD. In turn, HUD officials readily accommodated these brokers, awarding numerous projects to the developers they represented.

Many of these brokers leveraged their political influence to easily secure billion-dollar contracts for their employers, while also receiving generous compensation from the real estate developers. For instance, former Interior Secretary Watt received nearly $300,000 in "fees" after making just eight phone calls and having a half-hour meeting with the HUD secretary. While congressmen could not directly and openly accept "compensation," those who benefited from their assistance would repay them through donations to their election campaigns, a practice that was well understood.

According to the disclosures, projects approved through political lobbying often involved enormous waste and cost overruns. Additionally, HUD's internal management was chaotic, with unclear accounts and rampant embezzlement of public funds. These issues combined have reportedly cost taxpayers at least $4 billion. U.S. authorities are currently investigating these matters, with 630 cases already filed. In terms of scale and the number of people involved, the HUD scandal is comparable to last year's highly publicized case of defense department procurement officials accepting bribes.

The revelation of the HUD scandal has reignited the moral war on the American political scene. The Democratic Party accused the scandal of reflecting the corruption of the Republican administration, while the Republican Party retorted that "ten Pierces (former HUD secretary) are not worth one Wright (a Democrat and former Speaker of the House, who resigned in May due to violations of ethical regulations)." Both sides engaged in mutual recriminations, creating quite a spectacle.

Ordinary Americans are outraged by this scandal because, on one hand, the number of homeless people is continually growing, while on the other, powerful politicians are colluding with real estate developers to profit from "low-income housing." It is no wonder that an article in the *Wall Street Journal* described it as a "genuine scandal."

    美国丑闻不断  道德战再度爆发
    两党互斥腐败  原本是一路货色
    新华社华盛顿7月10日电  （记者黄泳）美国新闻机构最近连连披露前住房和城市发展部官员、共和党要人和房地产商内外勾结、营私舞弊的丑闻，使美国的廉政问题再次引起了公众的关注。
    美国住房和城市发展部（简称住房部）是专门负责为低收入者提供住房的部门。但在里根政府时期，住房部成了一处“政治交易所”。房地产商人为了争取到兴建和维修低收入者住房的有厚利可图的合同，纷纷雇用或指派所谓“路子硬”的人物，如里根的竞选功臣、前内阁成员和共和党议员等，到住房部游说，而住房部则为这些掮客大开方便之门，有求必应，把大批的项目承包给了他们所代表的地产商。
    不少掮客利用自己的政治影响，轻而易举地为雇主赢得数以亿计的美元的合同，同时自己也从房地产商那里得到“慷慨”报酬。如前内政部长瓦特，仅打了8个电话，再约住房部长面谈半小时，就拿到了近30万美元的“酬金”。国会议员们虽不便直接、公开地接受“酬谢”，但是接受过他们帮助的房地产商会通过捐赠竞选经费之类的方式予以报答，这是不言而喻的。
    据揭露，通过政客们说情而批准的项目往往浪费惊人，超支严重。另外，住房部内部管理混乱，帐目不清，贪污挪用公款成风。这两者合计，据说已给纳税人带来至少40亿美元的损失。美国有关部门目前正在就这些问题进行调查，迄今已立案630起之多。因此，从其规模和涉及的人数来看，住房部丑闻不亚于去年轰动一时的国防部军火采购人员受贿案。
    住房部丑闻被揭露后，使美国政坛趋于平静的道德大战再度爆发。民主党指责说，住房部的问题反映了共和党执政的腐败；而共和党则反唇相讥道：10个皮尔斯（前住房部长）也抵不上一个赖特（民主党人，前众院议长，因违反有关道德法规，今年5月被迫下台）。双方互相揭短，煞是热闹。
    普通美国人对这一丑闻感到气愤的是，在美国一方面无家可归者队伍不断扩大，而另一方有权势的政客们却同房地产商狼狈为奸，大发“低收入者住房”财。难怪《华尔街》一篇文章称之为“名副其实”的丑闻。
