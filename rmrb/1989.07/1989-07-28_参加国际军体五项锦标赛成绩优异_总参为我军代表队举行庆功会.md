Today in the afternoon, hundreds of soldiers and officers from the martial law enforcement units in the capital, along with comrades from the General Staff Department's Military Training Department and the Military Sports Team, gathered to welcome the military delegation that had just returned from the 37th International Military Pentathlon Championships in Venezuela. A celebration was held in their honor.

The Chief of the General Staff, General Der Hao-tien, and Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Han Huai-chih, and other relevant leaders attended the celebration. Der Hao-tien said in his speech, "The athletic achievements of a country reflect, to some extent, the national spirit and the level of civilization. Similarly, the military sports achievements of an army are also an indicator of its combat effectiveness. This time, the Chinese People's Liberation Army's military pentathlon team ventured to South America, overcoming various unfavorable conditions and difficulties, with an indomitable spirit and united struggle, winning new honors for the motherland and the army. They have showcased the might of our military on the international stage and demonstrated the spirit of contemporary Chinese soldiers. Comrades in the army should learn from them, fear no difficulties, be steadfast, and carry forward the five revolutionary spirits advocated by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, ensuring that the fine traditions of our army are passed down from generation to generation."

The head of the military pentathlon team, Wang Kezhong, and the athlete representative, Liang Xifen, reported at the celebration. They said that this time, in addition to achieving outstanding results by winning both the team and individual championships, the team also had significant political achievements, expanding the influence of China and the Chinese military in South America and the international military sports community. The Venezuelan national television and newspapers broadcast more than 30 pieces of news about the Chinese team, and local media praised the Chinese team.

A responsible comrade from the martial law enforcement unit hoped that the members of the military pentathlon team would continue to strive for excellence, train rigorously, and aim for a "three-peat" in next year's competition, adding more glory to the August First Flag.

    参加国际军体五项锦标赛成绩优异
    总参为我军代表队举行庆功会
    本报北京7月28日讯　记者刘小明、温子建报道：今天下午，数百名首都戒严部队指战员和总参军训部、军体大队的同志聚会一堂，欢迎刚从委内瑞拉参加第37届国际军体五项锦标赛凯旋的我军代表队，并为他们举行庆功会。
    总参谋长迟浩田上将、副总参谋长韩怀智中将等有关领导出席了庆功大会。迟浩田在讲话中说，一个国家的体育成绩如何，从一侧面反映出国家的精神面貌及文明发展程度；同样，一个军队军事体育成绩的好坏也是检验军队战斗力的标志之一。这次中国人民解放军军事五项代表队远征南美，克服种种不利条件带来的困难，以压倒一切的英雄气概团结奋战，为祖国和我军赢得新的荣誉。他们在国际赛场上扬我军威，再现当代中国军人的风彩。部队的同志们就是要像他们那样不怕困难，坚韧不拔，发扬邓小平同志提倡的五种革命精神，使我军优良传统代代相传。
    军事五项代表队负责人王克忠和运动员代表梁锡芬先后在庆功会上作了汇报。他们说，这次我军参赛除了取得包揽团体和个人两项冠军的优异成绩外，政治上也取得很好的效果，扩大了我国和我军在南美人民及国际军事体育界的影响。委内瑞拉国家电视台和报刊共播放了30多条有关中国队的新闻，当地舆论赞扬中国队。
    戒严部队某部负责人在讲话中希望军事五项代表队的同志们继续努力，严格训练，在明年的比赛中力争夺取“三连冠”，为八一军旗再增添光彩。
