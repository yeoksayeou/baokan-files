Title: Only with Environment, There is Art

Opening the paper, I wanted to write something to advocate for "environmental art," but the night breeze blew in, carrying the loud calls from the 1981 International Union of Architects' Fourteenth World Congress in Warsaw—

	“One of the most serious problems facing many countries today is the rapid deterioration of environmental pollution, which has reached an unprecedented level of disaster.”
	“The purpose of every human settlement plan should be to improve the quality of life for all people.”
	“Settlement planning must provide guarantees of freedom, dignity, equality, and social justice for all people.”
	“Every person has physiological, intellectual, spiritual, social, and economic needs. These needs are equally important and should be sought simultaneously as the rights of every person.”
	“Architects and planners should share the responsibility of meeting these needs in the process of forming the human environment.”

These calls made me think of the land that nurtured us, which is now being ravaged by man-made disasters such as garbage, sewage, noise, exhaust fumes, traffic congestion, deforestation, destruction of farmland, and drying up of water sources. They also made me think of the 6.3137 billion yuan in losses we suffer each year due to pollution from solid waste, air, and water.

Suddenly, I felt angry with myself. I was angry that I had only been passionate about working on drawing boards, T-squares, compasses, drafting pens, proportions, scales, colors, textures, lines, sequences, and the endless debates over symmetry and asymmetry. I was stuck in endless arguments about tradition versus modernity and the so-called explorations of modern and postmodern styles...

I put on my glasses, which I started wearing too early, and read carefully: "Architecture is the comprehensive art and science of establishing living environments for humanity. The responsibility of architects is to combine existing and new, natural and man-made elements and, through design, create spaces that are human-scale to improve the quality of urban landscapes." Yes, yes, no wonder the Warsaw Declaration loudly calls for architects in the new era to go beyond the "traditional understanding" of the profession and its responsibilities. We must take on a broader professional responsibility, that is, to shift the focus of our creation from single building designs to environmental design, from the trivial hobby of carving insects to serious concern for human survival environments. This is the new requirement of the new era for architects, and it is the new responsibility given to architects by the new era. Because the environment is related to people's physical and mental health and cultural and moral health, because the environment is related to the progress of all humanity, because the environment is the true sign of social civilization, because the environment is a part of human life.

The night breeze made me wake up: In today's China, what we need most is, as Hong Kong architect Chung Wa-lam said, to "promote environmental protection knowledge from a few people to the majority, from a small circle to a large popularization." Countless facts tell us that we are still far from the stage of fully advocating for the creation of "environmental art." We must know that the popularization of environmental protection knowledge is a necessary stage, an indispensable stage from sensory to rational elevation. Environmental art is the highest level. Without the hard and long preparation and transition of popularization, it is impossible to enter the highest level.

Everyone has seen that since the proposal of "environmental art," many people have been waving this flag, shouting about cranes and pandas, pavilions and towers, artificial hills and fountains, abstract sculptures, architectural miniatures, and even imitating ancient architecture. They arrogantly put these blind and even unrealistic things into environmental art. This is a phenomenon akin to scratching an itch through a boot. Even if there are a few good individual works, they cannot form a good environment. As the Italian urban designer Wolf said:

	“Good buildings do not bring good cities, and bad buildings do not necessarily produce bad cities.” What we need most today is first to protect nature and prevent pollution, and then on this basis, gradually seek the overall coordination of other environmental elements (buildings, trees, mountains, water, flowers, traffic, advertisements, sculptures, music, lighting, etc.), and then from the overall coordination, create our environmental art. The combination of macro and micro is what should be followed.

    唯有环境，才有艺术
    洪铁城
    铺开稿纸，想写一点为“环境艺术”摇旗呐喊的文字，想不到夜风阵阵，挟着1981年国际建筑师协会第十四次世界大会《华沙宣言》中的大声呼唤，穿过微启的窗扇，直冲我的脑门——
      “许多国家今天最严重的问题之一是环境污染的迅速恶化，现已达到空前的灾难程度。”
      “每个人类居住建设计划的目的应该是改善全体人民的生活质量。”
      “居住建设必须为人类提供自由、尊严、平等和社会公正的保证。”
      “每个人都有生理、智力、精神、社会和经济上的需要。这些需要都同样重要，必须作为每个人所应有的权利去同时谋求。”
    “建筑师和规划师应该在形成人类环境的过程中分担起满足这些需要的责任。”
    这些呼唤，使我联想到生养我们的土地，正遭受垃圾、污水、噪声、废气和交通堵塞、森林砍伐、农田毁坏、水源枯竭等人为灾害的侵袭；使我联想到每年有631.37亿元人民币损失在固体废物、大气、水等的污染之中。
    猛然之间，我恨了自己。恨自己往日里只热衷于在制图版、丁字尺、圆规、绘图笔上下功夫，沉缅于比例、尺度、色彩、质感、线条和序列，对称不对称的苦心推敲和斟酌当中不能自拔；纠缠在传统与现代的没完没了的争论之中，纠缠在现代、后现代的没完没了的所谓探索之中……
    我戴着戴得过早的老花眼镜，认真地一字不漏地读着：“建筑学是为人类建立生活环境的综合艺术和科学。建筑师的责任是要把已有的和新建的、自然的和人造的因素结合起来，并且通过设计符合人类尺度的空间来提高城市面貌的质量。”是的是的，无怪乎《华沙宣言》大声呼唤新时代的建筑师要超越对建筑这一职业和自身责任的“传统理解”；要“我们必须承担更大范围的专业责任”，即要建筑师把创作对象从单一的建筑设计转移到环境设计上来，从雕虫小技般的爱好转移到人类生存环境的严重关注上来。这就是新时代对建筑师的新要求，就是新时代赋予建筑师的新的责任。因为环境关系到人的生理心理健康和文化思想道德健康，因为环境关系到整个人类的进步，因为环境才是社会文明的真正标志，因为环境是人类生命的组成部分。
    阵阵夜风教我清醒：当今中国，最需要的应该像香港建筑师钟华楠所说的“由少数人推至多数人，由小圈子变成大普及”的普及环境保护知识。无数事实告诉我们，我们现在还远远没有到达全面提倡大搞“环境艺术”的时候。要知道，环境保护知识的普及是一个必然经历的阶段，一个不可缺少的从感性向理性升华的阶段。环境艺术是最高级的阶段，如果没有普及的艰苦而漫长的铺垫、过渡，就不可能进入最高级的阶段。
    大家都看到，自从“环境艺术”一提出，许多人就举着这面旗子咋呼，什么仙鹤熊猫，什么亭台楼阁，什么假山喷泉，什么抽象雕塑建筑小品，还有仿古建筑，还有高层超高层热，大言不惭地把这些盲目的、甚至是脱离实际的东西都塞到环境艺术中去。这是近乎隔靴搔痒的现象。纵然有极少数好的单体，也不可能形成好的环境。诚如意大利城市设计师沃尔夫所言：
  “好的建筑并不带来好的城市，而差的建筑也并不一定产生坏的城市。”我们当今最需要的先是保护自然，防止污染，然后在此基础上逐步求其另外的环境诸要素（建筑、树木、山水、花草、交通、广告、雕塑、音乐、灯光灯具等）的整体协调，再然后从整体协调当中创造我们的环境艺术。宏观与微观的结合，才是应该遵循的。
