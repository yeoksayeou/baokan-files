Zhenzhu Town in Laizhou City, Shandong Province, has actively launched innovative and content-rich "cell" cultural activities, attracting thousands of households and people of all ages. These activities have improved social ethics and strengthened the bonds of unity and cooperation among people.

To enhance ideological and political work in rural areas and promote spiritual civilization, Zhenzhu Town began organizing family cultural activities this year, focusing on families as the basic "cells." The activities cover political education, culture, science and technology, sports, and health. The town has organized various events such as "Family Intelligence Competition," "Farmers' Evening Party," "Family Recreation Festival," as well as martial arts, music, calligraphy, paper cutting, face molding, flower exhibitions, and stamp collecting. Representatives from these activities have been selected to participate in competitions at the town and city levels. These activities do not require dedicated venues and are easy to organize, making them suitable for the current rural setting where each family is an independent production and management unit. They have been well-received by the farmers.

    珍珠镇开展家庭文化活动
    本报讯　山东省莱州市珍珠镇积极开展形式新颖、内容丰富的“细胞”文化活动，吸引了千家万户、男女老少，提高了人们的社会公德水平，密切了人与人之间团结协作的关系。
    为了强化农村思想政治工作，促进精神文明建设，珍珠镇从今年初开始，以家庭为“细胞”，在全镇开展了包括政治教育、文化、科技、体育、卫生等内容的家庭文化活动。他们先后举办了“家庭智力竞赛”、“农家晚会”、“家庭游艺节”，以及武术、音乐、书画、剪纸、面塑、花展、集邮等多种家庭文化活动，并推选代表参加镇上和市里的比赛。这些活动，不需要建场地，便于组织发动，很适合目前农村一家一户为生产经营单位的特点，受到农民的欢迎。
