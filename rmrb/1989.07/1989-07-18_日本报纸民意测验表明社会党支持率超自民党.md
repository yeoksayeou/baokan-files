	Japanese Newspaper Poll Shows Social Party Support Exceeds LDP

	Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, July 18th – A recent poll conducted by the _Nihon Keizai Shimbun_ (Japan Economic Journal) has revealed that public support for the opposition Social Party has surpassed that for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).

	The newspaper reported this poll result prominently on its front page. The poll was carried out between July 8th and 11th, during the start of the House of Councillors election campaign, with 10,000 voters nationwide participating via telephone interviews. The results showed that the Social Party had a support rate of 27.8%, while the LDP had 25.8%. This is a rare occurrence in the LDP's over 30-year history of governance.

	According to the newspaper's analysis, the main reasons for the LDP's declining popularity include the forced implementation of the consumption tax, the involvement of party elites in the Recruit scandal, and the exposure of Prime Minister Uno's scandal involving paying for the services of a geisha. Additionally, the remarks made by the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, Horiuchi, regarding women's political participation further damaged the LDP's reputation.

	The newspaper suggests that if this trend continues, the results of the House of Councillors election on July 24th could see the LDP defeated and the Social Party victorious.

    日本报纸民意测验表明社会党支持率超自民党
    新华社东京7月18日电　《日本经济新闻》日前进行的一项民意测验表明，选民们对在野的社会党的支持超过了对执政的自民党的支持。
    该报今天在头版头条位置报道了这一民意测验结果。这次民意测验是在参院竞选活动开始后的7月8日至11日期间，以全国1万名选民为对象，采用电话询问方式进行的。结果表明，社会党的支持率为27.8％，自民党的支持率为25.8％。这在自民党长达30多年的执政史上是少见的。
    据该报分析，自民党如此不受选民欢迎主要有下列原因：强行实施消费税制度；党内权贵涉嫌利库路特公司行贿案；宇野首相用钱买艺妓作情妇的丑闻曝光。此外，农林相堀之内有关妇女不应参政的讲话也使自民党的威信大大下降。
    该报认为，如果这种形势继续下去，24日参院选举的投票结果有可能是自民党败北而社会党获胜。
