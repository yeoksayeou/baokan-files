In June, a total of 19,835 road traffic accidents occurred nationwide, resulting in 3,816 deaths, 12,222 injuries, and direct economic losses amounting to 25.67 million yuan.

Following the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, road traffic across the country has gradually returned to normal. However, there has been an increase in pedestrians violating traffic regulations, as well as instances of overloading, speeding, and driving with mechanical faults. Serious accidents causing multiple deaths and injuries have become more frequent.

The Ministry of Public Security has issued a notice urging the swift restoration of normal traffic order. It demands that public security organs at all levels strictly enforce management and law enforcement, strengthen road control, and repair and add traffic safety facilities.
