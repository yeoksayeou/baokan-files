Beijing Huadu Brewery was found to be wasting a significant amount of water, with 15 pieces of equipment directly discharging cooling water, causing it to flow away wastefully; 8 pipelines were in disrepair, wasting 132 cubic meters of water per hour. For this reason, the Beijing Municipal Water Conservation Office decided to impose an economic penalty.

This situation had a significant impact on Huadu Brewery. The factory director, Liu Xianzhou, voluntarily requested a reduction in his floating wage and replaced the relevant personnel responsible for water conservation. He mobilized the workers to take measures to conserve water.

The Beijing Municipal Water Conservation Office believed that the factory's attitude in correcting its mistakes was good, so it decided not to impose a fine for the time being, but instead gave a two-month deadline for corrections, with further observations to follow.

Beijing is a city with a large population and a severe water shortage. The annual water consumption is 4.7 billion cubic meters, but the available water supply is only 3.2 billion cubic meters, which is one-third short. In the past, considerable work was done on water conservation, but due to the lack of effective measures, the results were not significant.

Starting in 1986, relevant departments in Beijing emphasized "water management by law." They issued seven regulations and rules on water conservation: government agencies and organizations must firmly abolish the "big pot" water supply system and charge for living water use on a per-household basis; industrial water use must increase the rate of reuse; new, expanded, and renovated projects must include water-saving facilities; water use exceeding the plan must pay additional water fees... Those who violate the regulations will be subject to economic and administrative penalties according to the severity of the offense.

Implementing water management by law provides clear guidelines. Most government agencies and organizations have installed water meters per household, many enterprises have renovated equipment to increase the reuse rate of water, and new projects first consider water-saving devices... Water conservation work has made new progress.

However, there are still a few units that ignore the regulations and do not pay attention to water conservation. For these units, Beijing's approach is: first issue a yellow card warning and advise them, and if they do not improve, strictly enforce the regulations. In 1986, 150 units were inspected, with over 50 receiving penalties and fines totaling 180,000 yuan; in 1987, 600 units were inspected, with 296 receiving penalties and fines totaling 1.26 million yuan. Last year, 7,850 units were inspected, with one-third receiving penalties and fines totaling 3.84 million yuan.

Beijing is the capital, with many central government agencies and universities. The relevant departments in the city treat everyone equally. The Ministry of Construction is the superior department of the Beijing Municipal Water Conservation Office. This department's office was found to be wasting a lot of water, so the Municipal Water Conservation Office issued a yellow card warning and set a deadline for corrections. This matter drew the attention of the Minister of Construction, who immediately instructed the administrative department of the office to take effective measures to conserve water. Now, the Ministry of Construction has become an advanced unit in water conservation in Beijing.

Before 1986, Beijing Post and Telecommunications University used 186,000 cubic meters of water more than planned per year and was fined 680,000 yuan. After that, they mobilized everyone to establish a specialized water conservation organization and invested 100,000 yuan to renovate 260 sets (items) of sanitary fixtures and install swimming pool water purification and recycling devices. Last year, despite an increase of 14,000 square meters of dormitories and 40,000 square meters of public buildings, the water consumption decreased from 610,000 cubic meters in 1986 to 210,000 cubic meters. For such units, Beijing has given full recognition and rewards. This year, at the city's water conservation conference, the Municipal Water Conservation Office again recognized a number of advanced units and individuals in water conservation.

Of course, water management by law is a gradual process. Initially, it was only stipulated that government agencies should abolish the water supply system. Then, regulations such as the "Beijing Municipal Urban Water Conservation Award Measures," "Beijing Municipal Urban Water Waste Management Trial Measures," "Beijing Municipal Cooling Tower Management Interim Measures," "Beijing Municipal Water Use Unit Water Balance Test Management Regulations," and "Beijing Municipal Construction Project Water Conservation Facilities and Main Project Concurrent Construction Management Measures" were formulated. Last year was the year with the most water conservation regulations issued. Starting this year, management of groundwater and surface water has been strengthened. Any project involving the use and increase of surface water must first obtain a water permit from the competent department before construction can begin; otherwise, water will not be supplied, and violations will be penalized. At the same time, the groundwater resource conservation fund has begun to be levied, and progressive surcharges are imposed on units that exceed the plan for self-supplied wells. They plan to establish relevant regulations in the next two years, making them mutually supportive and forming a relatively complete regulatory system, so that Beijing can become a water-saving city.

### 依法管水——北京市节约用水的经验

    依法管水
    ——北京市节约用水的经验
    本报记者　刘燮阳
    北京华都啤酒厂浪费水严重，15处设备冷却水直接排放，哗哗流淌；8处管线失修失养，每小时浪费水132立方米。为此，北京市节水办公室决定给以经济处罚。
    这一情况对华都啤酒厂振动很大，厂长刘宪洲主动要求降一级浮动工资，并撤换了有关节水人员，发动职工采取措施节约用水。
    北京市节水办公室认为，这个厂改正错误态度较好，决定暂不罚款，限期两个月改正，以观后效。
    北京是一个人口众多的城市，也是一个缺水的城市，一年用水量达47亿吨，可供用水量只有32亿吨，欠缺1／3。过去，在节水上做了不少工作，由于缺乏有力的措施，收效不大。
    从1986年开始，北京市有关部门强调“以法管水”，先后颁布了节约用水7个法规、规定：各机关团体要坚决取消大锅饭的包水制，生活用水按户计量收费；工业用水要提高重复利用率；新建、扩建和改建工程项目，要配套设置节约用水设施；超计划用水必须缴纳加价水费……凡违背法规者，根据情节轻重，进行经济和行政的制裁。
    实行依法管水，有章可循，绝大多数的机关团体，分户安装了水表，不少企业改造了设备，提高了水的重复利用率，建设新的项目首先考虑了节水装置……节水工作取得了新的进展。
    但是，也有少数单位，无视法规，不重视节约用水。对这些单位，北京市采取的办法是：先提出黄牌警告，进行规劝，屡教不改，坚决按法规办事。1986年检查150个单位，受处罚的50多个，罚款18万元；1987年检查600个单位，受处罚的单位有296个，罚款126万元，去年检查7850个单位，1／3的单位受到处罚，罚款384万元。
    北京是首都，中央机关、大专院校多，市有关部门一视同仁。国家建设部是北京市节水办公室的顶头上司。这个部机关浪费水严重，市节水办照样向他们提出黄牌警告，限期改正。此事，引起了建设部部长的重视，立即责成机关行政部门，采取有效措施，节约用水。现在，国家建设部成了北京市节约用水的先进单位。
    1986年以前，北京邮电学院一年超计划用水18.6万立方米，被罚款68万元。此后，他们上下齐动手，成立了专门的节水机构，并投资10万元，改造卫生洁具260套（件），安装游泳池净化循环用水等装置，去年，在增加1.4万平方米宿舍和4万平方米公用建筑的情况下，用水量从1986年的61万立方米下降到21万立方米。对这样的单位，北京市大力进行了表彰和奖励。今年，在全市节约用水的大会上，市节水办又表彰了一批节约用水的先进单位和个人。
    当然，依法管水是逐步完善的。刚开始只是规定取消机关的包水制，接着制定了《市城镇节约用水奖励办法》、《市城镇用水浪费设施管理试行办法》、《市冷却塔管理暂行办法》、《市用水单位水量平衡测试管理规定》以及《市建设项目节约用水设施与主体工程同时建设管理办法》等法规。去年是颁布节水法规最多的一年。从今年开始对地下水、地表水加强了管理，凡涉及使用和增加地表水的工程项目，必须先向主管部门办理取水许可证方可施工，否则，不予供水，违反规定，要受处罚。与此同时，还开始征收地下水资源养蓄基金，对单位自备井超计划开采部分实行累进加价收费。他们准备在今明两年把有关的法规建立起来，相互配套，成为一个较为完整的法规体系，使北京成为节水型的城市。
