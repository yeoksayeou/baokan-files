According to the Office of the Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas under the State Council, since 1987, the E'xi Military Sub-Region has taken it upon itself to alleviate poverty and help the needy. It has actively organized various levels of People's Armed Forces departments and militiamen to extensively carry out the "One-Three-One" poverty alleviation and assistance activities, focusing on solving the food and clothing needs of impoverished households and gradually helping them to become prosperous. This has been praised by local officials and residents.

The "One-Three-One" activity involves one military or militia cadre, one administrative cadre, and three militiamen forming a poverty alleviation team to concentrate on helping one impoverished household solve their food and clothing needs and gradually achieve prosperity. So far, the E'xi Military Sub-Region has organized more than 7,800 "One-Three-One" poverty alleviation teams, with over 29,000 participants, assisting more than 9,000 impoverished households. After more than a year of effort, over 4,200 households have solved their food and clothing needs, accounting for 47% of the total households assisted. The economic situation of the remaining households has also improved.

Statistics show that in 1988, during the implementation of the "One-Three-One" activities, more than 130,000 workdays were contributed to the most impoverished households, more than 700,000 yuan in funds were raised, more than 100,000 kilograms of seeds were provided, 521 tons of fertilizer were supplied, and more than 1,000 technical training classes were held, training over 10,000 people.

To make the poverty alleviation activities more solid and effective, the military sub-region leadership, in collaboration with the prefecture government, organized a special team to conduct investigations and surveys in villages, documenting the population, labor force, and economic status of the most impoverished households, and categorizing and ranking them. Based on this, a "three assists, four musts" responsibility system was implemented: assisting the most impoverished households in their current year's production; helping to formulate a three-year poverty alleviation plan; assisting with technical training and solving urgent production needs for funds and materials. At the same time, it was emphasized that thought education must be started to activate internal vitality; basic living arrangements must be made to stabilize people's minds; collective difficulties must be solved to provide necessary conditions for production; and scientific and technological poverty alleviation must be emphasized to improve the quality of laborers and follow the path of scientific and technological poverty alleviation. The masses welcomed this sincere poverty alleviation effort.

    鄂西军分区扶贫有新招
    组织七千多扶贫小组　九千多贫困户近半脱贫
    本报讯　据国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组办公室介绍，1987年以来，鄂西军分区以扶贫济困为己任，积极组织各级人武部门和民兵，广泛开展以解决贫困户温饱问题为重要内容的“一三一”扶贫济困活动，受到贫困地区干部群众的赞扬。
    所谓“一三一”活动，是由一个人武干部或民兵干部、行政干部带三个民兵，组织一个扶贫小组，集中帮助一个贫困户解决温饱问题，逐步脱贫致富。到目前为止，鄂西军分区已经组织了7800多个“一三一”扶贫小组，参加人员2.9万多人，共扶持9000多个贫困户，经过一年多努力，现在已有4200多户解决了温饱问题，占扶贫总户数的47％。其余户的经济状况也有好转。
    据统计，1988年在开展“一三一”活动中，共为特困户帮工13万多个，筹集资金70多万元，解决种子10多万公斤，化肥521吨，举办各类科技培训班1000多期，共培训1万多人次。
    为了使扶贫活动更加扎实有效，军分区领导与州政府组织了专门班子，深入乡村，对特困户家庭人口、劳力以及经济现状进行调查摸底，登记造册，分类排队。在此基础上，实行“三帮助，四必须”的责任制：即帮助特困户搞好当年生产；帮助制定三年脱贫规划；帮助传授技术和解决生产急需的资金、物资问题。同时强调必须从思想教育入手，启动内在活力；必须从安排基本生活入手，稳定人心；必须从解决集体困难入手，为生产提供必要条件；必须从科技扶贫入手，坚持提高劳动者素质，走科技扶贫之路。群众对这种真心实意的扶贫非常欢迎。
