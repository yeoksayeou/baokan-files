The major Western countries experienced an economic "overheating" last year, leading to rising inflation. Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom were forced to implement tight monetary policies, raising interest rates several times. In the first few months of this year, these countries continued with this policy, and some even reduced or cut fiscal expenditures, while others shifted from tax cuts to tax increases. Due to the impact of this policy, private consumption in most Western countries has weakened this year, and the economic growth rate has slowed down or is expected to slow down.

The slowdown in the U.S. economy is quite evident, primarily reflected in non-agricultural sectors such as private consumption and industrial production. In the first five months of this year, industrial production saw growth only in January and April, while the other three months remained stagnant. Among the three pillars of industry, excluding steel, both the automobile and construction sectors have seen a decline in production and sales. Other industries, except for chemicals, paper, machinery, and textiles, have also seen little growth.

Additionally, the leading economic indicators for the first five months showed a decline over three months, with industrial goods orders showing significant fluctuations, indicating that industrial production will continue to fluctuate and grow weakly in the future.

Apart from agriculture, the main drivers of U.S. economic growth are private fixed capital investment and export growth. In the first quarter of this year, both saw growth of 7.6% and 15% respectively, but both were lower than the growth rates of the previous year.

As the U.S. economy slows down, the rise in food and energy prices has led to a 6.7% increase in consumer prices in the first five months of this year, significantly higher than the average of 4.1% last year.

While the U.S. trade and fiscal deficits have eased this year, the economic outlook may slow down further, and the continuously expanding net foreign debt remains a core concern for both the U.S. and the broader Western world.

The question of whether the U.S. economy is experiencing a "soft landing" (slow economic growth and mild inflation) or if a crisis has begun or is imminent is a major concern for the U.S. government and the economic community. Currently, the focus of U.S. economic policy is to balance between preventing an economic crisis and combating inflation, requiring both relaxation of tight monetary and credit policies and extreme caution. Recently, commercial bank preferential interest rates have been reduced from 11.5% to 11%, but the central bank discount rate (7%) remains unchanged. Externally, the pressure to further open up to other countries and regions continues. Thus, the U.S. economy is expected to grow by nearly 3% this year.

The economies of Western European countries will slow down due to rising interest rates or increased taxation, but due to the significant growth in corporate profits last year and preparations for the 1992 unified internal market, fixed capital investment is strong. Excluding the United Kingdom, the slowdown in the economies of Western European countries is not very evident, but the rise in the price level is universal. West Germany, due to significant investment and export growth, saw a 4.2% increase in GDP in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, with an estimated full-year growth of around 3%, and consumer prices are expected to rise by 2.5% to 3%. France, with the highest corporate profit growth in Europe last year, is expected to see an economic growth rate of over 3% this year, with consumer prices also rising by over 3%. The UK saw a 5.2% decline in industrial production in the first quarter compared to the previous quarter, with a significant trade deficit again, and consumer prices rose by about 7% in the first few months. The government was forced to tighten monetary policy again, with the basic bank interest rate reaching 14%, and the economic growth rate is expected to drop from last year's 4.4% to below 3%. It is estimated that the economic growth rate of Western Europe this year will shrink from last year's average of 3.4% to around 3%.

Japan's economic situation remains relatively good, with a 9.1% increase in GDP in the first quarter compared to the same period last year, and a price increase rate within 3%. Although the Japanese government did not implement new economic stimulus measures this year, and the consumption tax was levied starting in April, coupled with the recent increase in interest rates, which has had some impact on consumption, the economic growth rate is expected to be lower than last year's 5.7%. However, Japanese corporate profits are good, and interest rates remain the lowest in the West. Additionally, the recent weakness of the yen has helped to expand the trade surplus, promote corporate investment, and stimulate domestic demand, so the economic growth rate is expected to be close to 5% this year.

The slowdown in industrial production growth and the strengthening of trade protectionism in Western countries are affecting the export of industrial raw materials and products from developing countries. Some newly industrialized countries and regions in Asia have seen significant appreciation of their currencies against the dollar, weakening their commodity competitiveness and reducing export growth rates. Latin American and African debt-ridden countries will face increased burdens due to rising Western interest rates, making economic development even more difficult.

    当前西方经济的特点及其前景
    蔡述理
    西方主要国家去年经济“过热”，通货膨胀抬头。美、英等国被迫实行紧缩银根的信贷政策，利率几度调高。今年前几个月，它们继续沿袭这一政策，一些国家不敢扩大甚或削减财政开支，有的变减税为增税。由于这种政策的作用，今年来多数西方国家私人消费已经减弱，经济增长率已经降低或将要降低。
    美国经济放慢比较明显，主要反映在私人消费和工业生产等非农业经济方面。今年头五个月的工业生产，除一月和四月有所增长以外，其余三个月均处于停滞状态。工业的三大支柱除钢铁以外，汽车和建筑业的生产和销售都已萎缩。其他工业除化工、造纸、机械设备和纺织等外，生产也多裹足不前。
    此外，今年头五个月的先期经济指数出现了三个月的下降，其中工业品新订单曲折波动相当明显，说明今后工业生产仍将波动，增长乏力。
    除了农业以外，推动美国经济增长的主要动力来自私人固定资本投资和出口的增长，今年第一季度两者虽分别增长百分之七点六和百分之十五，但都低于去年的增长水平。
    在美国经济增长放慢的同时，因食品及能源价格上涨较大，今年头五个月的消费物价上涨百分之六点七，显然高于去年平均的百分之四点一。
    今年美国的贸易和财政赤字虽都有所缓解，但今后经济进展可能放慢，加上不断膨胀的净外债，因而“双赤”仍然是美国及整个西方世界焦虑的核心。
    美国经济放慢到底是“软着陆”（指经济增长缓慢和温和的通货膨胀）抑或危机已经开始或即将开始，是当前美国政府及经济界至为关注的。目前美国政府经济政策的重点，只能在反经济危机与反通货膨胀之间走钢丝，既要放松其紧缩银根与信贷的政策，又要十分谨慎。近来商业银行优惠利率已从百分之十一点五降至百分之十一，但中央银行贴现率（百分之七）仍维持不变。对外则继续压其他国家与地区对美国进一步开放门户。这样，今年美国经济可能增长近百分之三。
    西欧国家经济将因各国利率不断调高或增税而放慢，但因去年各国企业利润普遍增长较大，加之欧共体各国都在为一九九二年的统一内部大市场做准备，企业固定资本投资增长强劲。西欧国家中除了英国以外，经济放慢的情形不大明显，但物价上涨率提高则是普遍的。西德因投资和出口增长较大，今年第一季度国民生产总值比去年同期增长百分之四点二，估计全年可能增长百分之三，消费物价可能增长百分之二点五至百分之三。法国去年公司利润增长幅度为欧洲之首，今年经济增长率可达百分之三以上，消费物价也将上涨百分之三多一点。英国今年第一季度工业生产比上一季度下降百分之五点二，贸易再度出现较大逆差，今年头几个月消费物价年率上涨百分之七左右。政府被迫再度紧缩银根，银行基本利率高达百分之十四，今年经济增长率将从去年的百分之四点四降至百分之三以下。预计今年西欧经济的增长率将从去年的平均百分之三点四缩小为百分之三左右。
    日本经济形势仍然较好，今年第一季度国民生产总值比去年同期增长百分之九点一，物价上涨率在百分之三以内。虽然今年日本政府未实行新的刺激经济的措施，四月起又征收消费税，加之近来利率有所提高，对消费有一定影响，因而经济增长率可能低于去年百分之五点七的水平，但日本企业利润状况较好，利率仍为西方国家最低。同时，今年来日元疲软，有利于扩大贸易顺差，促进企业投资和内需增长，故今年其经济增长率仍可接近百分之五。
    西方国家工业生产增长放慢及贸易保护主义增强影响着发展中国家工业原料及工业品的出口。一些亚洲新兴工业国家和地区的货币对美元升值较大，商品竞争能力减弱，出口增长率降低。拉美及非洲债务国将因西方利率提高而加重负荷，经济发展更形困难。
