People's Daily, Guangzhou, July 23rd - Reporter Liang Zhaoming reports: The vibrant Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone has seen new developments in the first half of this year. Compared to the same period last year, the total industrial output value increased by 1.3 times, total profits increased by 40.05%, and the exports of "three types of enterprises" (foreign-funded, jointly-funded, and cooperatively-funded) grew by 43.43%. The economic benefits are remarkable and lead among the 14 national development zones.

In its four years of establishment, the development zone has completed basic construction investments of 1.049 billion yuan on 4.6 square kilometers of land. The investment environment is increasingly better, and the attraction is increasingly greater, significantly boosting the confidence of foreign investors. Recently, despite some cities and regions experiencing turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, Guangdong's situation has remained relatively stable. Most foreign investors in the development zone have not left, and those who temporarily left have quickly returned. Recently, many new investors have come to invest.

Statistics show that over the more than four years since the establishment of the zone, a total of 306 contracts have been approved, with more than half being production projects. The total investment in these projects is over 1.67 billion yuan, with foreign investment amounting to over 125 million US dollars. Among the 60 enterprises established in the first half of this year, 42 are foreign-invested enterprises.

    广州经济技术开发区吸引外商
    经济效益在全国14个开发区中领先
    本报广州7月23日电　记者梁兆明报道：生气勃勃的广州经济技术开发区，今年上半年又有新发展。与去年同期比较，工业总产值增长1.3倍，总利润增长40.05％，“三资”企业出口增长43.43％。经济效益之显著，在全国14个开发区中居领先地位。
    这个开发区创建4年，在4.6平方公里土地上完成基本建设投资10.49亿元，投资环境越来越好，吸引力越来越大，大大增强了外商的信心。前不久，一些地市相继出现动乱和反革命暴乱，由于广东局势比较稳定，开发区的外商大都没离开，暂时离开的也很快返回。最近，有许多新客商前来投资。
    据统计，建区4年多来，累计批准合同306个，其中生产性项目占半数以上；项目投资总额16.7亿多元，其中外商投资额为1.25亿多美元。今年上半年筹建的60家企业中，42家是外商投资企业。
