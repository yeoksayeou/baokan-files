People's Daily, Belgrade, July 11th: Correspondent Yan Zheng reports: Today, the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia held its 24th Plenum. The meeting discussed and approved the draft report on the work of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and its organs between the 13th Congress and the 14th Extraordinary Congress. One member of the Presidency and one member of the Central Committee were elected. The Plenum also passed a document on the direct tasks of implementing the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia's stance and resolution on Kosovo.

In his keynote report, Secretary of the Presidency of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, Kiro Gligorov, emphasized that Yugoslavia must undergo comprehensive and profound social reforms. Without such reforms, it will be impossible to solve the accumulated social problems and contradictions. Yugoslavia would face the danger of social regression, and even the possibility of a serious split within the League of Communists.

Gligorov pointed out that the overall development of society has prompted the League of Communists to reform itself in certain aspects, particularly in the renewal of cadres. However, in these processes, due to the existence of negative and excessive behaviors, immature actions, and the use of pressure, many conflicts have arisen within the League of Communists. Even within the League of Communists' institutions and organizations, and on major issues such as the federal system and reforms, there are different views and political attitudes. These conflicts and differences are particularly concentrated on the principles of the status and independence of the League of Communists organizations in the republics and nations, as well as the leading role of the League of Communists. Gligorov emphasized that these conflicts and differences must be approached with a calm mind, and a common, consensus-based solution must be adopted. This is crucial for the 14th Extraordinary Congress, which is scheduled to be held at the end of the year.

Many speakers called for an end to all disputes within the League of Communists, the cessation of conflicts between republics and nations, and for criticism and self-criticism from the central to the grassroots organizations regarding the current situation. They stressed the need to take decisive measures to overcome the current crisis.

    南共联盟第二十四次中央全会强调
    全面改革摆脱危机
    本报贝尔格莱德7月11日电　记者严正报道：今天南共盟中央举行第24次全会，讨论并通过了南共盟中央及其机构在13大和第14次非常代表大会之间工作报告草案，补选1名主席团成员和1名中央委员，全会还通过了关于实现南共盟中央对科索沃立场和决议的直接任务的文件。
    南共盟主席团书记科罗舍茨在主旨报告中强调，南斯拉夫必须进行全面的意义深远的社会改革，如果没有这种改革就不能解决聚集成堆的社会问题和矛盾，南斯拉夫就会面临社会倒退，甚至共盟内部有可能分裂的严重危险。
    科罗舍茨指出，整个社会发展，促使共盟自身在某些方面特别在干部更新方面进行了改革，但是在这些过程中，由于存在着不良的和过火的行为，存在不成熟的以及采取压力等做法，致使共盟内部出现了许多冲突，甚至在共盟机构和组织之间，在对待联邦制度和改革等重大问题上都存在着不同的观点和政治态度，这种冲突和分歧还特别集中在各共和国和民族的共盟组织的地位和独立自主以及南共盟领导作用等原则问题上。科罗舍茨强调对这些冲突和分歧要有冷静的头脑，并采取共同的协商一致的解决方法，这对将于年底召开的第14次非常代表大会来讲是至关重要的。
    许多发言都要求停止共盟内部的一切争吵，终止共和国和民族之间的冲突，从中央到各基层组织对目前的状况进行批评和自我批评，要采取转折性的措施摆脱目前的危机。
