Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 25th. (Reporter Yang Jianwu) From April to the first half of June this year, nine faculty members and researchers from Tongji Medical University who were studying and conducting medical research abroad returned to their alma mater one after another and resumed their scientific research and teaching work.

Among the nine returnees, there are professors in their late fifties and middle-aged and young teachers and researchers who have obtained medical doctorates.

Feng Zongqin and his wife Dai Guizhu are two professors who returned from West Germany on May 25th. Last October, they arrived in Heidelberg, West Germany, to work with German medical professionals to tackle the theoretical and clinical challenges of coronary heart disease risk factors. When serious turmoil occurred in China, their German friends hoped they would stay and work. Professor Feng Zongqin politely declined. He said, "My roots are in China. The motherland is still very poor and backward, and the Four Modernizations need a large number of talented people to build it."

Liu Deming is a lecturer at the Organ Embryology Research Room of Tongji Medical University. In 1986, he went to Essen, West Germany, as a visiting scholar to conduct research on "pancreatic cultivation for the treatment of experimental diabetes." After nearly three years of study, he obtained a medical doctorate in April this year. He twice refused to participate in the demonstrations in Bonn to support the "democratic movement" in Beijing and used his own growth experience to persuade overseas students not to do things that would harm the image of the Communist Party of China and the motherland.

    不受蛊惑　如期回国
    同济医大一批出国人员返母校
    新华社武汉7月25日电  （记者杨建武）今年4月至6月上旬，武汉同济医科大学有9名在国外从事医学研究和进修学习的教学科研人员相继返回母校，投入科研和教学工作。
    9名归国人员中，有年近6旬的老教授，有获得医学博士学位的中青年教师和科研人员。
    冯宗忱和他的夫人戴闺柱是今年5月25日从西德归来的两位教授。去年10月，他俩先后到达西德海德堡科学院同德国医学工作者合作攻克冠心病危险因子理论和临床实践的难题。当国内发生严重动乱时，西德朋友曾希望他们夫妇二人留下工作。冯宗忱教授婉言谢绝。他说“我的根在中国，祖国还很贫穷落后，四化大业需要大批有识之士去建设。”
    刘得明是同济医科大学组织胚胎教研室讲师，1986年作为访问学者到西德埃森市从事“胰岛培养治疗试验性糖尿病”研究。通过近三年进修，于今年4月获医学博士学位。他两次拒绝到波恩参加声援北京“民主运动”的游行活动，并以自己的成长经历劝说留学人员不要做有损中国共产党和祖国形象的事。
