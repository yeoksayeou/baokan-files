The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will take decisive measures from three aspects to rectify the order of Chinese medicine circulation.

Firstly, strengthen the management and operation of key varieties of Chinese medicinal materials. Determine the scope of key medicinal materials under state mandatory planning management and 20 varieties under guidance planning management, and implement contract-based procurement in medicinal material production areas. Strengthen price management, and implement coordinated pricing for main and secondary production areas for some medicinal material varieties to prevent unreasonable drastic fluctuations in prices.

Secondly, strengthen the management of the wholesale link of Chinese medicines. The wholesale business of Chinese medicines for retail pharmacies, medical institutions, and pharmaceutical factories will be uniformly operated by the wholesale agencies of medicinal material companies.

Thirdly, rectify the order of the Chinese medicine market. Local traditional Chinese medicine management departments should, in conjunction with the departments of commerce and health, inspect and clean up all enterprises and individual vendors engaged in Chinese medicine according to the relevant provisions of the Drug Administration Law, and strictly crack down on those that do not meet the prescribed conditions and those that operate without licenses or permits. Key rectification should be carried out in major Chinese medicine distribution centers that have a significant impact on the national supply of Chinese medicines, and various illegal activities should be severely cracked down. All improper practices in commodity circulation must be resolutely stopped, and a reporting system should be established. The State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine will set up an office for the rectification and regulation of the order of Chinese medicine circulation.

    国家中医药管理局采取措施
    整顿中药流通秩序
    据新华社哈尔滨7月24日电　（记者徐江善）记者从正在哈尔滨召开的全国中医药工作会议上获悉，国家中医药管理局将从3个方面采取果断措施，整顿中药流通秩序。
    首先，加强对中药材重点品种的经营和管理，确定国家指令性计划管理的重点药材品种的范围和20种实行指导性计划管理的药材，并在药材产区推行合同制收购。加强物价管理，对部分药材品种的收购价格实行主、次产区协调定价，防止价格不合理地剧烈起伏。
    其次，加强中药批发环节的管理。对零售药店、医疗单位和药厂的中药批发业务，由药材公司的批发机构统一经营。
    第三，整顿中药市场秩序。各地中药主管部门要会同工商、卫生部门，按照《药品管理法》的有关规定，对所有中药经营企事业单位和个体商贩进行检查清理，严格取缔不具备规定条件的和无证、无照的经营。对全国中药供应影响大的药材集散地要重点整顿，严厉打击各种违法活动。坚决制止商品流通中的一切不正之风，建立举报制度。国家中医药管理局将设立中药流通秩序治理整顿办公室。
