Generals Chen Xilian, Qin Jiwei, Du Yide, Zhao Landian, Tong Guogui, and Hou Liangfu contributed chapters on the Huaihai Campaign.

"Gallery of Portraits" features portraits of nine division commanders from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Central Plains Field Armies, including Yang Junsheng, Lei Shaokang, Zhou Fadian, Zhao Landian, Ma Zhongquan, Zhou Xihan, Li Chengfang, Chu Daming, and Cui Jiancong, as depicted by Li Keqing and Wan Haiting. It also includes General Chen Gong's autobiographical account from his early years and General Li Desheng's account of the corps commander Wang Jinshan.
