The late June visit of Iranian Parliament Speaker and presidential candidate Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani to the Soviet Union marked the first time since the 1979 Iranian Revolution that an Iranian leader has visited the Soviet Union. This visit is seen as a significant indicator of the rapid progress in Soviet-Iranian relations in recent years. During the high-level talks between the two countries, Rafsanjani noted that the Soviet Union's new thinking policy holds great significance for the development of Soviet-Iranian relations. Gorbachev described this visit as a "milestone event." Currently, the changing regional situation brought about by the end of the Iran-Iraq War and the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, as well as the mutual needs between the Soviet Union and Iran, are pushing the improving Soviet-Iranian relations into a new phase.

Restoring and developing economic and trade cooperation is an important aspect of current Soviet-Iranian relations. During his visit to the Soviet Union, the two countries signed a long-term cooperation agreement valid until the year 2000, with a total value of approximately $6 billion. According to the agreement, Iran will resume natural gas supplies to the Soviet Union, with an annual supply of about 3 billion cubic meters. The Soviet Union will help Iran expand the Isfahan Steel Plant, which was built by the Soviet Union in 1970 and has an annual capacity of 600,000 tons, increasing its annual capacity to 1.9 million tons. The Soviet Union will also help Iran build two power plants. In terms of transportation, the two sides will construct a railway from the Soviet border to the interior of Iran. The two sides also signed a trade cooperation agreement, stipulating that both sides will increase trade volume. Iran also signed several contracts with the Soviet Union to purchase weapons, aiming to achieve its goal of "diversifying weapons sources."

The development of Soviet-Iranian relations is closely related to geopolitical changes and adjustments in the foreign policies of both countries. In 1980, Iranian religious leader Ayatollah Khomeini proposed the slogan "Neither East nor West," referring to the United States and the Soviet Union as "two great Satans." In 1983, the Iranian Communist Party was disbanded, further worsening Soviet-Iranian relations. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the influx of large numbers of refugees into Iran not only widened the rift in Soviet-Iranian relations but also made Iran deeply concerned about the Soviet Union's strategic ambitions in the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, the Soviet Union's continued supply of heavy weapons to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War further infuriated Iran.

The Iran-Contra affair and subsequent U.S. missteps in the Persian Gulf provided an opportunity for a change in Soviet-Iranian relations. The military threats and economic sanctions imposed by the United States and other Western countries on Iran pushed Tehran and Moscow to gradually narrow their differences. In early 1987, 1,200 Soviet engineers returned to Iran, and the Soviet side agreed to provide Iran with more than 200 Soviet-made long-range missiles. Later, due to the Soviet Union's lease of three oil tankers flying the Soviet flag to Kuwait, there was a rift between the Soviet Union and Iran. However, this small cloud was quickly overshadowed by the subsequent sharp deterioration in Iran's relations with the West. Faced with the United States' aggressive posture in the Persian Gulf, Soviet-Iranian relations found new common ground. Iran hoped to export oil through Soviet territory, while the Soviet Union sought to cautiously and steadily fill the vacuum left by the West in the Persian Gulf region.

After the end of the Iran-Iraq War, Soviet-Iranian relations improved rapidly with the adjustment of each other's foreign policies. To begin post-war reconstruction, Iran decided to improve relations with the West while expanding and strengthening ties with Eastern countries, including the Soviet Union. In January, Ayatollah Khomeini wrote to Gorbachev, emphasizing Iran's policy of developing relations with the Soviet Union.

In the Soviet Union, Gorbachev's new thinking and reform line laid the foundation for the Soviet Union to pursue a comprehensive diplomatic strategy in the Middle East. At the same time, due to the deterioration of relations between the United States and the West with Iran, their ability to influence Persian Gulf affairs was weakened. In January, Gorbachev, when receiving Khomeini's personal representative, said, "The Soviet Union and Iran are destined to live in harmony and cooperate." The subsequent "Satanic Verses" controversy further exacerbated the tensions between Iran and the West. These factors provided the Soviet Union with an opportunity to improve relations with Iran. Soviet Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov recently pointed out, "Now is the time for the Soviet Union and Iran to more actively develop economic and other relations."

On the other hand, the Afghanistan issue and the Islamic Revolution are two important factors affecting Soviet-Iranian relations. On the Afghanistan issue, Iran supports the Afghan Mujahideen and provides bases and funding for the eight-party alliance's Mujahideen. The Soviet Union hopes that Iran will change its stance and support the establishment of a "broad-based coalition government" in Afghanistan, including the Kabul regime. Additionally, the Soviet Union has 20 million Muslims within its borders, so it has long been wary of Iran's Islamic Revolution.

The development of Soviet-Iranian relations has drawn the attention of the United States and other Western countries. Since the death of Ayatollah Khomeini, the West has been closely monitoring the situation and exploring ways to improve relations with Iran. According to foreign media reports, in the future, as Iran pursues its "pragmatic diplomacy," it may gain the upper hand between the East and the West.

    苏伊关系的新发展
    朱梦魁
    6月下旬，伊朗议长、总统候选人拉夫桑贾尼对苏联的访问，是自1979年伊朗革命以来伊朗领导人首次访苏，被认为是近年来苏伊关系大步前进的明显标志。在苏伊高级会谈过程中，拉夫桑贾尼认为，苏联新思维的政策对发展伊苏关系具有巨大意义。戈尔巴乔夫称这次访问是“划阶段事件”。当前，由两伊战争结束和苏联从阿富汗撤军所带来的地区形势的变化，以及苏伊之间的互有需求，正在把不断改善的苏伊关系推向新的阶段。
    恢复和发展经贸合作，是目前苏伊关系的重要方面。访苏期间，两国签署了到2000年的长期合作协议，总金额约60亿美元。根据协议，伊朗将向苏联恢复天然气供应，年供气量约30亿立方米。苏联帮助伊朗扩建1970年由苏联建设的年产60万吨的伊斯法罕钢铁厂，使该厂的年产量增至190万吨。苏联还将帮助伊朗建设两个发电厂。在运输方面，双方将建设从苏联边境到伊朗内地的铁路。双方还签订了贸易合作议定书，规定双方将增加贸易额。伊朗还与苏联签订了几个购买武器的合同，以便实现伊朗所主张的“武器来源多样化”的目标。
    苏伊关系的发展与地缘政治的变化和两国外交政策的调整紧密相关。1980年，伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼提出“既不要西方，也不要东方”的口号，称美苏为“两个撒旦”。1983年，伊朗共产党被取缔，苏伊关系进一步恶化。而苏联入侵阿富汗以及大批难民涌入伊朗，不仅扩大了苏伊关系的裂痕，而且使伊朗对苏联觊觎海湾不冻水域的战略企图倍感担忧。另一方面，苏联在两伊战争中不断向伊拉克提供重武器，更增加了伊朗的愤怒。
      “伊朗门事件”及此后美国在海湾的举止失误，给苏伊关系的改变带来转机。美国等西方国家对伊朗的武力威胁和经济制裁，推动德黑兰与莫斯科逐渐缩小距离。1987年初，苏联的1200名工程技术人员重返伊朗，苏方还同意向伊朗提供200多枚苏制远程导弹。此后，由于苏联向科威特出租3艘悬挂苏联国旗的油轮，致使苏伊之间发生龃龉。但这一小片阴影很快就为继之而来的伊朗与西方关系的急剧紧张所冲淡。面对美国在海湾剑拔弩张的架势，苏伊之间有了新的共同点，伊朗希望通过苏联领土运出石油，苏联则谋求谨慎而稳步地填补西方在海湾地区留下的真空。
    两伊战争结束后，苏伊关系随着各自外交政策的调整加快了改善的步伐。为着手战后重建，伊朗决意在改善与西方关系的同时，扩大和加强与包括苏联在内的东方国家的联系。今年1月，霍梅尼致信戈尔巴乔夫，强调伊朗的政策是要同苏联发展关系。
    在苏联方面，戈尔巴乔夫的新思维和改革路线，为苏联在中东地区推行全方位外交奠定了基础。同时，由于美国和西方与伊朗交恶而削弱了对海湾事务发挥重要影响的能力。今年1月，戈尔巴乔夫在接见霍梅尼的私人代表时说，“苏联和伊朗注定要和睦相处和合作”。随后发生的“拉什迪风波”更使伊朗与西方一度缓解的矛盾再度激化。这些因素为苏联改善与伊朗的关系提供了良机。苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫不久前指出，“现在是苏联和伊朗更积极地发展经济和其他各种关系的时候了。”
    另一方面，阿富汗问题和伊斯兰革命，则是影响苏伊关系的两个重要因素。在阿富汗问题上，伊朗支持阿富汗游击队并为八党联盟的游击队提供基地和资助。苏联则希望伊朗改变立场，支持在阿富汗建立包括喀布尔政权在内的“基础广泛的联合政府”。另外，苏联境内有2000万穆斯林，所以，对伊朗的伊斯兰革命一直存有戒心。
    苏伊关系的发展引起美国和其他西方国家的关切。自霍梅尼去世后，西方正密切关注形势并试探与伊朗改善关系的途径。据外电预测，今后随着伊朗推行其“务实外交”，有可能使它在东西方之间争得主动。
