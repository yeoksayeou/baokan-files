Agricultural development cannot proceed without funds and materials. Recently, in accordance with the deployment of the State Council's Land Development and Construction Fund Management Leading Group, our working group conducted an inspection of the agricultural development work in the Sanjiang Plain of Heilongjiang Province. How to effectively allocate funds and materials for agricultural development was one of the key topics of our investigation.

Funds Introduction and Grain Export
The Sanjiang Plain has a heavy development workload and a large demand for funds, but the amount of funds that the state and province can provide in the short term is limited, which restricts the progress of development. Last year, Heilongjiang Province adopted the method of introducing funds from outside the province, finding a way to solve the problem of fund shortages. Currently, most of the funds introduced by the province come from industrially developed regions and industrial enterprises, and are repaid in the form of compensatory trade. This is a relatively good form of social financing for agriculture under the current condition of national fund shortages.

However, it seems that repaying with goods is a logical practice, but in reality, it does not work. There are two reasons for this: First, grain has a market but no price, making it difficult to export compensatory trade grain out of the province. Relevant departments stipulate that any city or county that has not completed its contract procurement task is not allowed to export grain out of the province. In fact, under the "dual-track" policy for grain, the widening price gap and the heavy procurement tasks, as well as the "white checks" issued for procurement, have increased the difficulty of completing procurement tasks. Statistics show that farmers in Heilongjiang Province have about 2.5 billion kilograms of grain stored at home, and it is not that there is no grain to sell. In addition, some local areas affected by disasters cannot complete their procurement tasks, which often affects the opening of the regional grain market. In summary, the objective result is that the procurement task does not die, and the market is not active. This situation of neither dead nor alive determines that compensatory trade grain must give way to contract procurement, thus affecting the introduction of funds. Second, the policy of linking money and grain has tied itself up. The development agreement signed by the state with the province stipulates that for every 1 yuan of state investment (including grants and loans), Heilongjiang Province must stably deliver 5 jin of commercial grain to the state every year. Due to the heavy grain linkage task, the increased grain must be guaranteed to be delivered to the state, making it impossible to guarantee trade compensation, and vice versa.

In view of the above situation, we believe that as long as the development truly forms new grain production capacity, whether the money and grain are linked or not is not important. Because the increased grain, whether circulated through multiple channels in the market or through national procurement and allocation, plays a consistent role in solving the national grain market balance. If the money and grain linkage must be emphasized, the current solution for the export of compensatory trade products out of the province and abroad is to allow the use of newly increased grain to offset compensatory trade products, allow compensatory trade grain exported out of the province to offset linkage tasks, or give preferential policies to the compensatory trade of products introduced with funds.

Funds Investment and Grain Output
The principle of obtaining more grain output with less funds investment is a basic principle that should be followed in agricultural development. The development agreement signed by the state with the province stipulates a money-grain linkage ratio of 1:5. According to our investigation, this indicator is difficult to achieve. According to the agreement requirements, the completion of the task of transforming 6 million mu of low-yield fields and opening up 3 million mu of wasteland can only form a grain production capacity of 900 million kilograms, which is far from the 1.5 billion kilograms of tasks stipulated in the agreement. According to the agreement, the shortfall will be made up by adjusting from non-development areas. This approach will inevitably make non-development areas bear the additional burden of delivering commercial grain to the state, which is contradictory to the current grain policy and also creates a false sense of development benefits.

In addition, there is a time difference of about 2 years between the actual formation of production capacity by development and the stipulated linkage period, that is, the land developed in the current year has very limited production capacity in the current year. Therefore, when the state and the province sign the agreement, they must adhere to the principle that the state's investment is consistent with the local production capacity, so as to mobilize the enthusiasm of the central government, local governments, and the masses for development.

Based on the above analysis, we believe that the linkage between investment and output can be chosen in two ways: First, the investment funds should not be linked to the delivery of commercial grain, but should be linked to the increase in production capacity; Second, the funds should be linked to the delivery of commercial grain, but the linkage method should be adjusted in three aspects: adjusting the linkage ratio or clearly stating that the loan part is not linked; according to the principle of comprehensive development, the corresponding non-grain products and grain conversion products should be counted as delivery tasks; the grain linkage time should be counted from the investment year and extended by 1 to 2 years.

Development and Construction with Material Supply
Currently, the agricultural production materials needed for development have neither supply channels nor supply quotas, and it is difficult to continue by moving them around. The Sanjiang Plain has few people and much land, a long frozen period, a short construction season, and field operations and water conservancy projects are basically operated by machinery. Without diesel, not only can the project not be constructed, but even the mature crops cannot be harvested. State farms reflect that last year's development tasks were completed by using this year's production diesel. If the state does not increase the supply of diesel this year, it will affect normal production activities.

For this reason, the state should include the supply of materials needed for agricultural development in the planned channel and make special arrangements. In particular, diesel is of great importance to the Sanjiang Plain, but the state's planned diesel quota for agriculture has not changed for many years. According to the needs of development and the increase in cultivated land area, the diesel quota for agriculture should be increased accordingly.

In addition, with the progress of development, grain production will increase significantly, and the issues of grain procurement, drying, storage, and transportation have been put on the agenda. If these problems are not solved, grain will be left in large quantities with farmers. Therefore, the state should make early arrangements for grain procurement, implement procurement funds, arrange the construction of drying and storage facilities, and formulate a feasible grain protection price policy.

    怎样调剂农业开发的钱和物？
    ——来自三江平原的情况和建议
    万宝瑞　吴起超　李书民
    农业开发离不开资金和物资。前些日子，根据国务院土地开发建设基金管理领导小组部署，我们工作组对黑龙江省三江平原农业开发工作进行了一次考核性检查。怎样调剂好农业开发中的钱和物？就是我们这次调查研究中的一个重要课题。
    资金引进与粮食出境
    三江平原开发任务重，资金需要量大，而近期国家和省能够拿出的资金有限，制约着开发的进程。去年，黑龙江省采取引进省外资金的办法，找到了一条解决资金短缺的途径。目前，该省引进的资金，多数是来自工业发达地区和工业企业，以补偿贸易的形式偿还。这是当前在国家资金紧缺的情况下，社会集资办农业的一种较好形式。
    但是，以物还钱看起来似乎是顺理成章的做法，实际上是行不通的。原因有二：一是粮食有行无市，补偿贸易的粮食出省难。有关方面规定，凡是合同定购任务未完成的市县，粮食一律不准出省。事实上，在粮食“双轨制”政策环境下，平议差价的一步步拉大，以及定购任务重和收购上的“打白条”，加大了定购任务完成的难度。据统计，黑龙江省农民家中储粮约有25亿公斤，绝非无粮可卖。还有，局部地区因受灾完不成定购任务，也往往殃及到地区粮食市场的放开。总之，客观的结果是定购不死，市场不活。这种不死不活的状况，决定了补偿贸易的粮食必须为合同定购让路，从而影响资金引进。二是钱粮挂钩政策自己捆死了自己。国家同省签订的开发协议中规定，国家每投资1元钱（包括拨款和贷款），黑龙江省必须长期稳定地每年上交5斤商品粮。因挂钩粮食任务重，增产的粮食要保证上交国家，就无法保证贸易补偿，反之亦然。
    鉴于上述情况，我们认为，只要通过开发真正形成粮食新增生产能力，钱粮挂钩不挂钩无关紧要。因为增产的粮食不管通过市场进行多渠道流通还是通过国家收购调拨，在解决全国粮食市场平衡上所起的作用是一致的。如果一定要强调钱粮挂钩的话，对于补偿贸易的产品出省及出国来说，目前解决的办法是，允许用新增产的粮食顶抵补偿贸易的产品，允许补偿贸易出省的粮食顶抵挂钩任务，或对引进资金的产品补偿贸易给予优惠政策。
    资金投入与粮食产出
    以较少的资金投入换取较多的粮食产出，是农业开发中应遵循的一条基本原则。国家同省签订的开发协议中规定钱粮挂钩比例为1∶5，据我们调查，这个指标很难完成。按协议要求，完成600万亩低产田改造、300万亩开荒的任务，只能形成9亿公斤粮食的生产能力，与协议中的15亿公斤的任务差距很大。按协议规定，不足部分由非开发区调剂补足。这种做法势必使非开发区无端额外承担上交国家商品粮任务，与现行粮食政策相矛盾，也造成开发效益上的虚假。
    另外，开发实际形成生产能力与规定挂钩期限存在约2年的时间差，就是说当年开发的田地，当年形成生产能力是很有限的。因此，国家与省签订协议时，一定要本着国家的投资与地方生产能力相一致的原则，这样才能调动中央、地方、群众开发的积极性。
    根据上述分析，我们认为投入与产出挂钩可作两种选择：一是投入资金不要与上交商品粮挂钩，而与新增生产能力挂钩；二是资金与上交商品粮挂钩，但在挂钩方法上须作三点调整：调整挂钩比例或明确贷款部分不挂钩；根据综合开发的原则，相应地把非粮产品和粮食转化品折粮算为上交任务；粮食挂钩时间应从投资年度算起顺延1至2年。
    开发建设与物资供应
    目前开发所需要的农用生产资料，既无供应渠道，亦无供应指标，东挪西凑，实难为继。三江平原人少地多，封冻期长，施工季节短，田间作业和水利施工基本全靠机械操作。没有柴油，不仅工程无法施工，即使是已成熟的庄稼也收不回来。国营农场反映，去年的开发任务是挪用了今年的生产用油完成的，如果今年国家不增加柴油供应，将要影响正常的生产活动。
    为此，国家应把农业开发所需物资的供应纳入计划渠道，专项安排。特别是农用柴油对三江平原显得尤为重要，而国家计划内的农用柴油指标已多年未变，根据开发的需要和耕地面积的增加，要相应增加农用柴油的指标。
    此外，随着开发的推进，粮食产量将有较多的增长，粮食的收购、烘干、储存、调运等问题已提到议事日程上来。这些问题如不解决，粮食将大量滞留农民手中。为此，国家应及早安排粮食的收购，落实收购资金，安排烘干、储存设施的建设，制定切实可行的粮食保护价格政策。
