Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, July 28th.

The Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Political Bureau on July 28th pointed out that the election of Jaruzelski as the President of the Republic is "beneficial to the stability and security of Poland." At the same time, it believes that the entire party should "draw lessons" from the recent parliamentary election losses.

The above views were mentioned in a report submitted to the continuation of the 13th Central Committee Plenum of the Polish United Workers' Party, which opened on July 28th.

The Political Bureau of the Polish United Workers' Party, in a report titled "Evaluation of the Election Campaign," identified four reasons for the losses: First, many people in society hold a "critical attitude" towards the ruling party; second, the domestic social and economic situation has deteriorated, especially the "supply situation in the market"; third, the Polish United Workers' Party has shown "weakness" in political struggle and lacks a "sense of threat"; fourth, there were mistakes in the election campaign, including misjudging the so-called "neutral attitude" of the church, misjudging the possibility of the alliance candidates winning, and poor propaganda, mobilization, and organizational work during the election process.

The Political Bureau emphasized the necessity of learning from the mistakes and pointed out that the entire party must "consistently and effectively accelerate the reform process in Poland"; take decisive measures to "improve the economic situation as soon as possible," as well as "deepen the party's own reforms" and "strengthen political work in all fields."

    波党总结选举失利教训
    强调深化改革　加强政治工作
    据新华社华沙7月28日电  （记者汤德乔）波兰统一工人党中央政治局28日指出，波兰统一工人党领导人雅鲁泽尔斯基当选共和国总统“有利于波兰国家稳定和安全”，同时认为，全党应从不久前举行的议会选举失利中“吸取教训”。
    上述看法是波兰统一工人党中央政治局向28日开幕的波兰统一工人党第13次中央全会续会提出的一份报告中提到的。
    波党中央政治局在题为《对选举运动的评价》的报告中认为，这次失利的原因有四：第一，社会上不少人对执政的党派“持批评态度”；第二，国内社会、经济形势恶化，特别是“市场供应形势恶化”；第三，统一工人党在政治斗争中“表现软弱”，“缺乏威胁感”；第四，在竞选运动中失误，其中包括错误地估计教会的所谓“中立态度”，错误地估计联盟派候选人当选的可能性，在竞选过程中宣传鼓动和组织工作差等。
    政治局强调从失误中吸取教训的必要性，并指出，全党今后必须“始终不渝地和有效地加速波兰的改革进程”；采取果断措施，以“尽快改善经济形势”，以及“深化党的自身改革”和“加强各个领域的政治工作”。
