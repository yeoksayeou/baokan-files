To meet the needs of anti-corruption efforts in China, the National Supervision Department and some colleagues from Renmin University of China have compiled the book "Foreign Administrative Supervision Theories and Practices," published by Shandong People's Publishing House.

This is the first comprehensive and systematic book in China that introduces foreign administrative supervision. It covers the supervision systems, administrative judicial systems, parliamentary impeachment systems, party supervision systems, administrative litigation systems, property declaration systems, and gift-acceptance systems of over 30 countries and regions. It also provides an overview of the political climate and economic supervision systems of some countries.
