The Soviet Supreme Soviet on July 4 approved the list of main leadership members of the new Soviet government.

According to reports from local news media on July 4, Lev Voronin and Yuri Maslyukov were appointed as First Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers, responsible for routine work and state planning, respectively. L. Abalkin (economic reform), I. Belousov (military-industrial complex), A. Biryukova (social issues), V. Gusyev (chemical and forestry complex), V. Doguzhiyev (extraordinary situations), N. Lavrov (culture), P. Mostovoi (material and technical supply), L. Ryabyev (fuel and energy complex), and I. Silayev (machine-building complex) were appointed as Deputy Chairmen of the Council of Ministers.

According to the report by Council of Ministers Chairman Ryzhkov on June 10, the new Soviet government should have 3 First Deputy Chairmen and 10 Deputy Chairmen. Currently, one First Deputy Chairman (responsible for food issues) is still missing because a suitable candidate has not been found. Meanwhile, F. Kamentsyev (foreign economic relations), who was nominated by Ryzhkov, did not receive enough votes and was not elected as Deputy Chairman.

Previously, the Soviet Supreme Soviet had approved the appointments of the new government's foreign minister, defense minister, and finance minister. On July 4, several more individuals were appointed as ministers, including A. Sersyukov (aviation industry) and K. Katyshev (foreign economic relations).

    批准对政府新领导人任命
    新华社莫斯科7月4日电  苏联最高苏维埃4日批准了苏联新政府被任命的主要领导成员名单。
    据此间新闻媒介4日报道，列夫·沃罗宁和尤里·马斯柳科夫被任命为苏联部长会议第一副主席，分别负责常务工作和国家计划。列·阿巴尔金（经济改革）、伊·别洛乌索夫（军工综合体）、阿·比留科娃（社会问题）、弗·古谢夫（化学和森林综合体）、维·多古日耶夫（非常局势）、尼·拉韦罗夫（文化）、帕·莫斯托沃伊（物资技术供应）、列·里亚别夫（燃料动力综合体）和伊·西拉耶夫（机器制造综合体）9人被任命为部长会议副主席。
    按照部长会议主席雷日科夫6月10日的报告，苏联新政府应设3名部长会议第一副主席和10名副主席。现在尚缺一名第一副主席（负责食品问题），原因是还未找到合适人选。而雷日科夫提名的弗·卡缅采夫（对外经济）因未获足够的票数，没有当选副主席。
    在此之前，苏联最高苏维埃曾批准了新政府外长、国防部长和财政部长的任命。4日又有一些人被任命为部长，他们是阿·瑟斯措夫（航空工业）和科·卡图谢夫（对外经济联络）等人。
