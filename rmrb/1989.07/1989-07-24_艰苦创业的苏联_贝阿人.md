Two centuries ago, the great Russian scientist Lomonosov said: "The strength of Russia lies in the development of Siberia's rich natural resources."

In the mid-1970s, the Soviet Union began to put this prophecy into practice, deciding to build a second Siberian railway. It runs from Ust-Kut, northwest of Lake Baikal, to Komsomolsk-on-Amur on the Amur River, a total length of over 3,100 kilometers, known as the Baikal-Amur Mainline (BAM). The builders of this railway and the surrounding areas are known as the "Baikal-Amur people."

On July 23, 1974, the first batch of tunnel workers left their footprints in the vast snowy wilderness, marking the official "birth" of the Baikal-Amur people. This seemingly ordinary name is filled with the spirit of selfless dedication, the courage to struggle with nature, the tenacity to endure hardship, and the yearning for a beautiful future in Siberia. It is with these ideals and aspirations that they voluntarily devoted themselves to this great pioneering cause. Young man Sharatov said with great enthusiasm: "I want to see this great project completed with my own eyes and am willing to make a humble contribution to it."

This is the largest undeveloped region in the world with abundant resources. The northern part is in the permafrost zone, with winters lasting over 200 days and temperatures as low as -60°C. In the south, during the summer, the roads are muddy and only tracked vehicles can pass. Due to the unpredictable weather, there is a saying in the area: "Siberian weather is like a woman's heart." The BAM railway will cross vast primeval forests, boundless deserts, seven mountain ranges, nine major rivers, and over 3,000 small rivers. Along the entire line, 3,200 facilities, 2,000 bridges, 200 stations, and a total of 32 kilometers of tunnels will be built. Due to its location in an earthquake zone, the engineering quality must be able to withstand a 7.0 magnitude earthquake. A French reporter who visited the site exclaimed: "This is an unprecedented feat. Only those who are passionate about their work can achieve such greatness."

At the beginning of the construction, to save money, many housing, shopping, hospital, and school projects were cut. Therefore, the recruited personnel were mainly single young people. They lived in temporary sheds or traditional Siberian snow huts, and their hardships are easy to imagine. Some people left after working for a while, but those with aspirations not only persevered but also attracted their girlfriends or fiancées to join them, forming Baikal-Amur families. Now, the young people of that time have entered middle age and have children. The grandparents of these children, in order to take care of the third generation, also gave up comfortable living conditions and traveled thousands of miles to join the ranks of Baikal-Amur residents. However, the living conditions here have not changed much. Out of the 45 residential points along the line, only 20 have relatively complete living facilities. Permanent housing construction is slow, and many people have to wait at least 10 years to get a house. Therefore, the "Baikal-Amur people" use discarded wood to build their own houses. Some people set up abandoned train carriages on concrete bases and add a couple of wooden sheds. Others grow vegetables in front of their houses. Although the houses are simple, the interior decoration is very careful, with wallpaper on the walls, tapestries hanging, and self-made furniture and bathrooms. They jokingly call such residential points "Shanghai." What worries them is the education of their children. The construction of schools, nurseries, and kindergartens cannot meet the needs, and many schools have to implement a three-shift system.

Due to initial poor planning and mismanagement, the main line of the Baikal-Amur railway, which was completed and put into trial operation in 1984, incurred a loss of 250 million rubles each year. Therefore, some people suggested that the Baikal-Amur railway be divided into sections and assigned to nearby other sections. At the same time, some environmental experts strongly opposed further large-scale economic development. The Baikal-Amur people, who have devoted their entire youth to the Baikal-Amur railway, are determined to fight for their labor achievements. They believe that the problem is not whether to develop or not, but how to develop. They established the Baikal-Amur Railway Protection and Regional Development Center, launched a signature collection campaign, and submitted a petition to the central government to state their views.

Recently, the Baikal-Amur Mainline Railway Corporation, directly under the Ministry of Transportation, decided to vigorously promote industrial and housing construction here and accelerate the development process through the introduction of foreign capital. The construction of the Baikal-Amur region will enter a new stage. When the prosperous Baikal-Amur region rises on the Soviet land, people will not forget the spirit of selfless dedication of the first generation of Baikal-Amur people.

    艰苦创业的苏联“贝阿人”
    周象光
    两个世纪前，俄国伟大的科学家罗蒙诺索夫曾说过：俄罗斯的强盛在于开发西伯利亚丰富的自然资源。
    本世纪70年代中期，苏联开始把这个预言付诸实践，决定修建第二条西伯利亚大铁路。它从贝加尔湖西北方的乌斯季库特至阿穆尔河畔的共青城，全长3100多公里，简称贝阿铁路。这条铁路和沿线地区的建设者随之就被称为“贝阿人”。
    1974年7月23日，首批隧道工人在人迹罕至的茫茫雪原踏出的足印，标志着贝阿人的正式“诞生”。这平淡无奇的称号饱含着创业者无私奉献的精神、与大自然拚搏的勇气、忍受困苦的坚强毅力和对西伯利亚美好未来的憧憬。因为他们正是怀着这样的理想与抱负，自愿投身到这一伟大的开拓事业中的。年轻小伙子沙拉托夫满怀豪情地说：“我要亲眼看着这项浩大工程建成，并愿为它作出微薄的贡献。”
    这里是世界上仅存的资源丰富而未被开发的最大地区。其北部属永久冻土带，冬季长达200多天，最低气温达零下60℃。南部进入夏季后，道路泥泞不堪，只有履带式车辆才能通行。因天气变化无常，当地有“西伯利亚的天气——美女的心”这样一句歇后语。贝阿铁路要横穿莽莽的原始森林，浩瀚无垠的荒漠，共计7座山脉，9条大河和3000多条小河。全线要建3200多项设施、2000多座桥梁、200多个车站和总长达32公里的隧道。由于地处地震带，工程质量必须能经受7级地震的考验。前去采访的法国记者慨叹说：“这是前所未有的壮举，只有热心于事业的人，才能建树如此功绩。”
    建设之初，为了节约资金，砍去了许多住房、商店、医院、学校等生活设施项目。因此，招募的人员以单身青年为主。他们住在临时工棚里或西伯利亚传统的搭在雪橇上的窝棚里，生活之艰苦不难想象。有的人干了一段时间便离开了，而那些有志者不仅自己坚持了下来，而且他们的女友或未婚妻也被吸引来，组成了贝阿人的家庭。如今，当年的年轻人已进入中年，有了子女。孩子们的祖母、外祖母为了照看第三代，也放弃了舒适的生活条件，千里迢迢来到这里，加入了贝阿居民的行列。可是，这里的生活条件并没有太大的变化。全线建起的45个居民点中，仅20个有较完备的生活设施。永久性住宅建设进展缓慢，许多人至少要等10年才能分到住房。于是，“贝阿人”就利用废旧木料自己动手兴建住房。有的把废弃的火车车厢架设在水泥底座上，再接一两间木棚。还有人在房前屋后开地种菜。贝阿人热爱生活，房屋虽然简陋，内部装修却很精心，墙上糊壁纸，挂壁毯，有自制的家具和浴具。他们把这样的居民点诙谐地称作“上海”。令他们操心的，是子女的教育。学校、托儿所、幼儿园的建设远不能满足需要，许多学校只好实行三部制。
    由于当初计划不周和管理不善，贝阿铁路主干线1984年建成试运营后，每年亏损2.5亿卢布，于是有人主张，将贝阿铁路分段划归临近的其它路段。与此同时，一些环保专家极力反对继续大规模的经济开发。为贝阿铁路献出了全部青春的贝阿人，决心为保卫自己的劳动成果而斗争。他们认为，问题不在于要不要开发，而是如何开发。他们成立了保卫贝阿铁路和促进地区开发中心，开展征集签名活动，并上书中央申述自己的主张。
    最近，交通建设部直属的贝阿大铁路联合公司决定，在这里大力开展工业和住房建设，并通过引进外资加快开发进程。贝阿地区的建设将进入一个新阶段。当繁荣昌盛的贝阿地区勃然兴起在苏联大地时，人们将不会忘记第一代贝阿人艰苦创业的献身精神。
