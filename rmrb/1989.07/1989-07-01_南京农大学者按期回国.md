	Scholars from Nanjing Agricultural University Return to China as Scheduled
	Xinhua News Agency reports: Correspondent Gong Yongquan reports: Three scholars from Nanjing Agricultural University who were sent abroad for study and further education have recently returned to the university upon completion of their studies.

	Dr. Zhong Funing, who returned to the motherland on June 16, is 38 years old. He graduated from the School of Agricultural Economics in 1982 and was selected to pursue further studies at the University of Manitoba in Canada in September 1983. He obtained his Ph.D. on June 2 of this year. At that time, some foreign media outlets distorted the facts about the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in China, causing some people who were not fully informed to have doubts. Many people advised Zhong Funing to delay his return to China. His master's advisor called him three times from out of town to persuade him to stay, but Zhong Funing politely declined. He returned to China on June 14.

	Zhong Funing had worked in the countryside for over 9 years and studied in Canada for nearly 6 years. He said: "The stark contrast in economic development levels made me realize that we need the policy of reform and opening up, and we also need a long-term stable and united environment. We must not create new social unrest. Otherwise, no matter how pure and good the intentions and wishes are, the results will be the opposite. What I have seen and heard since returning to China has proven that my choice was correct."

	The two visiting scholars from Nanjing Agricultural University, Associate Professor Li Yueyun and Lecturer Zhou Xudong, also returned to China on schedule on June 2 and May 18, respectively.

    南京农大学者按期回国
    本报讯　记者龚永泉报道：南京农业大学派往国外学习、进修的三名学者，学成以后，最近按期回到学校。
    6月16日回到祖国的钟甫宁博士今年38岁，是该校农经系1982年的毕业生，1983年9月被选派赴加拿大曼尼托巴大学深造，于今年6月2日获得博士学位。当时，由于国外一些新闻媒介歪曲我国国内平息反革命暴乱的事实真相，使一些不明真相的人产生了疑虑。不少人劝钟甫宁推迟回国，他的硕士导师从外地一天打了3个电话挽留他，钟甫宁婉言谢绝。6月14日，他回国。
    钟甫宁曾在农村插队劳动9年多，又在加拿大学习近6年。他说：“经济发展水平的强烈对比使我认识到，我们需要改革开放的政策，也需要一个长期的安定团结的环境，千万不能造成新的社会动乱。否则，不管动机和愿望是如何的纯洁与良好，效果却会背道而驰。回国后的所见所闻，证明了我的选择是正确的。”
    南京农大派出的两名访英学者李岳云副教授和周曙东讲师也分别在6月2日和5月18日如期回国。
