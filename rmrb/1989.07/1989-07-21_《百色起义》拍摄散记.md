The Baise of today is vastly different from what it was 60 years ago. The only remnant of the past is the "Guangdong Guild Hall," which has been preserved as a revolutionary historical relic. The production team for "The Baise Uprising" arrived at the Guangdong Guild Hall to begin filming scenes such as the "Enlarged Meeting of the Prefectural Committee" and the "Announcement of the Formation of the Red Seventh Army." The Baise town organized a large number of people to participate in the work of extras. Among them were workers, farmers, students, government officials, and neighborhood committee members. They took the director's instructions seriously and rehearsed repeatedly.

After "persuasion and education," everyone was willing to dress according to the director's requirements, wearing peasant clothes, military caps, straw shoes, and even cutting their hair. However, the production team had only two makeup artists, and even with three heads and six arms, they couldn't handle the task of cutting the hair of over 200 people in one day. Fortunately, all the barbers from the state-owned and private barbershops near the Guangdong Guild Hall brought their tools to the scene and set up shop. They declared that they would not charge a penny and would contribute their humble efforts to "The Baise Uprising." People lined up to get their hair cut short, and among them, the "Eight Heroes" requested a full shave.

There was only one thing that gave the production team a headache. Whenever Lu Qi, who played Deng Xiaoping, appeared on set, he was immediately surrounded by the crowd and asked to take photos. This sometimes disrupted the filming. What to do? Everyone understood the feelings of the crowd, but the filming could not be delayed. The assistant director and the production manager tried to persuade and explain to the crowd, but it had little effect. Director Chen Jialin had an idea and took the microphone: "Comrades, thank you for participating in our filming. Please take your positions and we will start shooting. Today, I will definitely set aside time for everyone to take photos with 'Comrade Deng Xiaoping.'" This method worked, and everyone, young and old, smiled and happily stood in their designated positions. After the shooting was completed, the eight bald heroes were the first to take photos with "Comrade Deng Xiaoping." An elderly retired comrade from Baise Town, who was once a subordinate of General Zhang Yunyi, said happily after participating in the performance and taking a photo: "Being able to take a photo with 'Comrade Deng Xiaoping,' today's visit was not in vain."

To fulfill everyone's wishes, Lu Qi, who played Deng Xiaoping, did not appear for meals several times, as he was still being surrounded by the crowd.

Thanks to the People from All Directions

The Party, government, and military departments of the Baise region formed a co-production team, with the deputy secretary of the regional committee serving as the leader. He personally visited the site and gave his all. The peasant uprising army needed 2,000 pairs of straw shoes, but in an era where straw shoes are no longer made, where could they be found? After the co-production team's research, they immediately ordered the weaving factory in Tian'e County to stop exporting woven grass products and to work overtime to produce 2,000 pairs of straw shoes.

Wei Benbo, a member of the co-production team and deputy mayor of Tian'e County, often appeared in front of the director. His sturdy and robust figure and his rough yet agile mannerisms caught the director's eye, and he was cast as an actor, playing the role of Yan Min in the drama and becoming a leader of the peasant army. His performance was quite convincing. The local cultural bureau director, the federation chairman, and a group of cultural officials also successively played the roles of Nationalist Party's old remnants in the drama.

After the production team moved to the Wuzhou outdoor location, the mayor of Wuzhou took charge of the co-production team. Upon learning that the filming required the use of multiple boats, the mayor convened an emergency meeting that night and immediately arranged for boats to be used for filming.

In the film, there is a scene where the peasant army crosses a river, but it happened to be early winter, and the river had dried up, making it impossible to film. The co-production team then played a significant role, coordinating with various parties to agree that the upstream reservoir management department would release water to support the filming. Since the reservoir was quite far from the filming location, it would take over five hours for the water to reach the filming site based on the water flow speed. The relevant departments began releasing water at around 4:30 AM and by around 10:00 AM, the water reached the filming site, allowing the scene to be completed smoothly.

The Multi-Talented Commander

The large-scale scenes of the "Jiang-Gui War" and the "Guangxi Warlord's Defeat" were about to begin filming, with each scene requiring the use of tens of thousands of troops. Due to the tight schedule and the numerous night scenes, filming faced many challenges. However, commanding tens of thousands of people to film a movie is not something that a scholar can handle. The deputy chief of staff of a certain unit of the PLA, Wang, who assisted in the filming, was both a military and cultural expert. For the production team, he was truly a "treasure." In the heavy scene of "Whipping Wei Guang," he repeatedly explained the atmosphere, content, and requirements of the play to the soldiers playing the old army soldiers. He said, "At this moment, the feelings of each witness are both angry and indignant but dare not speak..." What a precise inspiration! Those who were not actors quickly entered their roles, with accurate feelings and genuine expressions, achieving excellent artistic effects.

Before the large-scale scenes began filming, the site with tens of thousands of people had the overall deployment of guns, cannons, and vehicles; the deployment of ambushes, assaults, and retreats; the deployment of tanks and cavalry... Deputy Chief of Staff Wang coordinated the command smoothly.

"Heaven Helps Me"

On December 20th, the weather was clear and sunny, and on this "golden day," the large-scale scenes of the "Jiang-Gui War" were to be filmed. Tens of thousands of troops gathered at the filming site, and within the line of sight, it was all people. The "battlefield" spanning several square miles had truck convoys, cavalry, artillery, stretcher teams, and infantry carrying guns, all in formation. This scene originally required a gloomy effect, but since the local weather had been clear for some time, it was decided to film it during the sunset, meaning that nearly ten thousand troops would have to stay on the set for the whole day. However, unexpectedly, the weather turned cloudy that morning, and it started to drizzle. It seemed as if the heavens had specially arranged this for the filming of "The Baise Uprising." Everyone was overjoyed, and the director seized the opportunity to start filming. The filming site with tens of thousands of people became lively...

This scene had just been filmed, and the clouds dispersed. "Truly, heaven helps me!" The director's voice came over the loudspeaker: "All departments, gather around me." They were arranging to film the sunny scenes. In this way, the task originally planned for one day was completed in half a day.

Heaven's help was not just this once. On the afternoon of December 29th, the production team finished filming the last scene of the entire film in Wuzhou. Starting the next day, Guangxi experienced continuous rain for half a month. Truly, "heaven has eyes"!

From August 25th, when the indoor scenes began filming in Changchun, to this day, the effective working days for the pre-production phase totaled 89 days. The film had 14 scenes with over a thousand people and 5 scenes with over six thousand people. The film used a total of 31 tons of gasoline in the outdoor locations, and the costumes and props alone filled 47 trucks. This massive film cost 4 million yuan, saving 500,000 yuan from the original budget.

    《百色起义》拍摄散记 
    笑夫  琼子
      与“小平同志”合影
    今日的百色市与60年前已面目皆非，唯有今日作为革命历史文物的“粤东会馆”还保持着昔日的容貌。《百色起义》摄制组来到粤东会馆，开始了“前委扩大会”“宣布成立红七军”等几场戏的拍摄。百色镇组织了大量人员参加群众演员工作。这里有工人、农民、学生、机关干部、街道居委会的老大娘。他们严肃认真地按照导演的要求一遍又一遍地排练。
    经过“说服教育”，人们都愿意按导演要求穿农装、戴军帽、穿草鞋直至剪发剃头……但是摄制组里仅有两名化妆人员，他们就是三头六臂也难在一天以内把两百多个长发理光。还好，粤东会馆附近所有国营、个体理发店的师傅们，纷纷带上理发工具赶到现场，摆开阵势理开了。且声明不收分文，为“百色起义”献微薄之力。人们纷纷排队争着理短发，其中有“八勇士”要求理个全光。
    唯有一件事，让摄制组颇费了一翻脑筋。只要扮演邓小平的卢奇一在现场出现，马上就被群众包围起来，与他合影留念，这样有时便影响了拍摄。怎么办？大家的心情都能理解，但拍摄工作又不能耽误。副导演、制片主任在人群中劝说、解释，均没有什么效果。陈家林导演灵机一动，拿起麦克风：“对同志们能参加我们的拍摄，我表示感谢，请同志们各就各位开始拍摄。今天，我一定给大家留出时间，让每个人都能与‘邓小平同志’拍上照片。”这一办法果真灵验，男女老少，笑逐颜开，愉快地站到了指定位置。拍摄完毕，那八位光头勇士最先与“小平同志”合了影。百色镇有一位离休的老同志，过去是张云逸大将的老部下。他在参加了演出并合影后高兴地说：“能与‘邓小平同志’照张像，今天算没白来。”
    为了满足大家的愿望，扮演邓小平的卢奇同志，几次到吃饭的时间还没有见到他的身影，原来他还在被重重“包围”之中。
        多谢四方众乡亲
    百色地区党、政、军部门组成了协拍小组，地委副书记出任组长。他亲临现场，全力以赴。农民起义军需要两千双草鞋，在草鞋已经绝迹的今天，哪找啊！经协拍小组研究，当即下令田东县编织厂暂停编织出口草类织品，要加班加点打出二千双草鞋。
    协拍小组里的韦奔波，是田东县副县长，他经常在导演跟前闪来晃去。那壮实敦厚的体魄，那粗犷灵活的举止，被导演相中，他当上了演员，扮上了剧中人物严敏，成了农军领袖，戏还演得蛮像那么回事。当地的文化局长、文联主席以及一批文化干部都先后在剧中扮演国民党的遗老遗少。
    摄制组转点到梧州外景地后，梧州市长出任协拍小组组长。当得知拍摄要动用多艘船只时，市长连夜召开紧急会议，旋即调船只供拍摄使用。
    片中一组镜头是农军涉水过河，可是适逢初冬时节，河水已干枯，无法拍摄。协拍小组此时又发挥了大作用，经多方协商，管理上游水库的部门同意放水支持拍片。由于水库距离实拍地点比较远，按水的流速计算，要五个多小时才到达拍摄点，有关部门于深夜四时多开始放水，至上午10时左右水抵拍摄现场，这组镜头就这样顺利拍完了。
        多才多艺的指挥官
      “蒋桂战争”和“桂系军阀败下战场”等场面宏大的重场戏就要开始拍摄，每场戏得动用上万人的部队。由于时间紧，夜景多，给拍摄带来诸多困难。而指挥上万人拍电影绝非文人所能胜任的。协助拍摄的解放军某部王副参谋长文武双全，他不但懂军事，对影视表演还颇有研究，对摄制组来说真是“如获至宝”了。在“鞭打韦光”这场重戏中，他反复地向扮演旧军队士兵的战士们讲解戏的氛围、内容和要求。他说：“每个目睹者此时此刻的心情是又愤又怒而且不敢言……”多么准确的启示，那些并非演员的战士，情绪很快进入各自的角色，感觉准确，表情真切，收到了极好的艺术效果。
    大场面的镜头开始拍摄之前，万人的现场上，有枪炮车辆的整体调度；有伏击、冲锋、负伤溃退的调度，有坦克、骑兵队的调遣……王副参谋长都配合指挥得有条不紊。
          “天助我也”
    12月20日这天风和日朗，在这个“黄金日子”，要实拍“蒋桂战争”的大场面，万人的部队云集在拍摄现场，视线之内全是人，方圆几里地的“战场”，卡车运输队、骑兵队、炮队、担架队以及扛着枪的步兵队全都摆开了阵势。这场戏原来要求的光效是阴雨天，鉴于这段时间当地都是晴天，经过研究只好放在日落黄昏之际来拍，也就是说近万人的队伍要在现场折腾上整整一天。可谁知这天上午天气突然转阴，竟下了毛毛细雨，仿佛是老天爷专门为《百色起义》的拍摄而布置的。大家欣喜若狂，导演抓紧时机开始实拍了。万人的拍摄现场沸腾了起来……
    这场戏刚刚拍完，云开雾散。“真是天助我也！”只听高音喇叭传来导演的喊声：各部门向我靠拢。他们又在布置拍摄晴天的戏了。就这样，原订一天的任务在半天里完成了。
    老天爷帮忙并非仅此一次。12月29日下午4时，摄制组在梧州拍完了全片最后一个镜头。从次日起，广西连续半个月阴雨，真是“老天有眼”！
    从8月25日在长春开拍内景到这一天，影片前期的有效工作日共89天。全片千人以上的场面达14次，6000人以上的场面达5次。影片在外景地共用去汽油31吨，仅服装、道具就装了47卡车。这样一部巨片，耗资400万元，比原计划节约了50万元。
