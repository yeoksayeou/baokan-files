The light industry sector across the country has overcome numerous difficulties to achieve commendable results in increasing production and ensuring effective supply. In the first half of the year, the total industrial output value reached over 115 billion yuan, completing 49% of the annual plan. Out of 18 main products, 13 saw growth compared to the same period last year, effectively balancing the need to increase production of essential items and reduce output of non-essential ones. For instance, essential goods like salt, sugar, and synthetic detergents saw increases ranging from 10% to 24%. High-currency-return products such as refrigerators, washing machines, and beer saw increases ranging from 9% to 34%. Export-oriented products like canned goods and electric fans saw increases ranging from 12.9% to 24%. Meanwhile, the production of liquor, which is restricted by industrial policy, decreased by 11.5% compared to last year.

The stable growth of the light industry in the first half of the year is a result of implementing the rectification and adjustment policies. At the beginning of this year, the Ministry of Light Industry proposed a policy of prioritizing effective supply. Production arrangements were made with a focus on selective increases and decreases, promoting the best and eliminating the worst, and addressing surpluses and shortages. Priority was given to basic necessities for urban and rural residents, short-supply market products, high-currency-return products, and export-oriented products. Especially for basic necessities, local light industry departments have ensured the supply of raw materials, energy, and funds through various means. At the same time, for high-energy, high-grain-consuming products like liquor, production was restricted, resulting in a significant decrease compared to the same period last year.

It is understood that due to issues with raw materials, energy, and funds, the production situation in the second half of the year is quite grim. Particularly, the shortage of foreign exchange has led to delays in the arrival of some imported raw materials, which will bring greater challenges to light industry enterprises.

    上半年轻工生产平稳  下半年形势比较严峻
    本报讯　全国轻工业战线克服重重困难，在增加生产，保证有效供给方面取得了可喜的成绩。上半年工业总产值完成1150多亿元，完成全年计划的49％。18种主要产品中，比去年同期增长的有13种，基本上做到了该保的上，该压的下。如盐、糖、合成洗涤剂等人民生活必需品分别增长了10％至24％，高回笼货币的电冰箱、洗衣机、啤酒等分别增长9％至34％，出口创汇较多的罐头、电风扇等分别增长12.9％至24％。产业政策限制生产的白酒比去年降低11.5％。
    轻工业上半年稳定增长，是贯彻治理整顿方针的结果。今年年初，轻工业部就提出实行倾斜政策，保证有效供给。安排生产采取有取有舍，有保有压，优胜劣汰，截有余补不足的办法。对城乡人民基本生活必需品、市场短线产品、高回笼货币产品和出口创汇产品开绿灯。特别是人民生活必需品，各地轻工业部门在原材料、能源、资金等方面千方百计予以保证。与此同时，对白酒等高耗能、高耗粮的产品，采取限制生产的办法，使其比去年同期明显下降。
    据了解，因为原材料、能源、资金的问题，轻工业下半年的生产形势比较严峻，特别是外汇紧张，部分进口原材料不能及时到货，将给轻工企业带来更大困难。
