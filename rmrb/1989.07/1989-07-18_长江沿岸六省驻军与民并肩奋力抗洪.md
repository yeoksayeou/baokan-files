Military units stationed along the Yangtze River in six provinces have dispatched large numbers of personnel and supplies to support local people in flood relief and disaster prevention.

Since late June, parts of Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have experienced heavy rainfall, resulting in severe floods. Military units have successively dispatched over 4,000 personnel and a batch of vehicles and river-crossing equipment to participate in the relief efforts. So far, they have relocated and evacuated more than 300,000 people trapped by the floods, transported over 2,400 tons of various materials, and resolved nearly 20,000 dangerous situations.

In Sichuan, dozens of counties and cities have been hit by floods. The Chengdu Military Region has mobilized the army, air force, reserve forces, and militias to actively participate in the flood control efforts. According to statistics, over 70,000 militia members and reservists organized by the Sichuan Provincial Military Region have rescued more than 100,000 flood-stricken people in the severely affected areas of Nanchong, Chongqing, Daxian, and Wancheng.

Military units in Hubei and Hunan provinces have also organized their troops to fully engage in flood control and disaster prevention along the Yangtze River, determined to fight alongside the people to ensure the safety of the Yangtze River during the flood season.
