Recently, we conducted a survey in Lixian County, Hebei Province, focusing on how to strengthen party building work in the new era. During the survey, we observed a mixed situation: significant achievements in reform and opening up, rapid development of commodity economy, and party building work facing new challenges.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the momentum of reform in Lixian County has been rapid, and the commodity economy has developed swiftly. In 1988, the per capita income in the county reached 700 yuan, and the total industrial and agricultural output value reached 7.9 billion yuan, more than four times that of 1980.

The rapid development of the commodity economy in Lixian County is closely linked to the active efforts of party organizations at all levels. However, due to the rapid transition from old to new, ideological education has lagged behind, leading to a weakening of Marxism-Leninism and communist beliefs among rural party members, and a decline in the attractiveness of party organizations. The methods and approaches of party member ideological education are not well-suited to the current situation. Some party members cannot withstand the tests of reform and opening up, engaging in power-for-money exchanges, using their positions for personal gain, accepting bribes, and disregarding party discipline and national laws, resorting to any means to make money. Additionally, due to imperfect systems, party disciplinary cases have increased significantly.

Facing these new problems, the Lixian County Party Committee has actively explored and taken several effective measures:

Conducting ideological and purpose education. In their educational work, they have changed the previous approach of "one-size-fits-all" and adopted a more targeted and effective method by teaching in layers and by industry. To make the education more vivid and concrete, the county committee has used various forms to publicize the deeds of the party branch in Xinxiang Village, where the party members always remember to serve the people wholeheartedly. In Xinxiang Village, helping the poor has become a spontaneous action of the Communist Party members. Nearly a hundred party members have voluntarily transferred projects to the poor, providing funds totaling 230,000 yuan. For the construction of village hospitals, school buildings, and farmers' cultural activity centers, all party members in the village have voluntarily donated money. Under their influence, the masses have also donated generously.

Conducting anti-corruption and frugality education. First, the county committee started from itself, implementing the "two openness and one supervision" system, exposing issues such as recruitment and job transfers that are most sensitive to the masses, allowing the masses to supervise, and setting an example. Next, starting from functional departments, they clarified responsibilities by industry, formed systems, strengthened supervision, and seriously investigated and dealt with some corrupt issues in government agencies. Last year, in the anti-corruption struggle, 15 administrative companies of party and government agencies were cleaned up, 32 cases were investigated and resolved, 210,000 yuan in disciplinary violations were uncovered, and 13 disciplinary party members were seriously dealt with.

Establishing a new perspective on personnel. In the new era, rural grassroots cadres not only need to have strong party spirit, upright style, and high political quality, but also need to have a strong commodity economy consciousness, be able to lead the masses to become rich, and have the ability to lead and the skills to get rich. Based on this standard, they have adjusted the village branches, boldly promoting and appointing party members who have good political qualities, commodity economy consciousness, leadership abilities, and the skills to get rich, injecting vitality into the village branches.

Strengthening collective economic strength and enhancing the cohesion and attractiveness of the branches. Since 1985, when the county committee called for all village branches in the county to establish collective enterprises and strengthen the collective economy, rural collective enterprises have developed to 175. Yongxing Village used to have weak collective economic strength, and the school buildings were in disrepair, making it difficult for the masses to access water. In 1986, the village branch established three collective enterprises, with the village collective earning more than 2 million yuan annually. Subsequently, 150,000 yuan was invested to build a school building, and every household was equipped with tap water. Additionally, the village took over all water, electricity, and land tax fees for the masses. The village branch spoke honestly to the masses and did practical things, and the party members and masses saw it with their own eyes, benefited themselves, and naturally became closer to the village branch. Now, when the village holds a party member or mass meeting, the loudspeaker calls, and everyone gathers in an instant.

Adhering to the principle of unifying party members' rights and obligations. Strengthening the construction of party internal democratic institutions, so that every party member can not only fulfill their obligations but also fully exercise their rights, making the party organization have strong cohesion and combat effectiveness. The party branches in Xinxiang, Liuzhuang, Dabaishi, and Wujiaying villages, whenever there are major issues concerning the entire village, first convene a party member meeting for discussion, unify thoughts, and then implement them. Village cadres say: "In the past, only obligations were emphasized, party members were unhappy, and everything was difficult to do; now, both obligations and party members' rights are emphasized, and everything is smooth."

    在新的考验面前
    ——蠡县党建工作调查
    安甫生　赤光明
    最近，我们带着如何搞好新时期党建工作这个问题，到河北省蠡县进行调查。调查中，我们看到一种喜忧参半的现状：改革开放成绩显著，商品经济发展迅猛，党建工作面临考验。
    党的十一届三中全会后，改革的势头在蠡县发展很快，商品经济迅猛发展。1988年，全县人均收入700元，工农业总产值达到7.9亿元，比1980年增长4倍多。
    蠡县商品经济发展迅速，是和各级党组织的积极努力分不开的。但是同时，由于新旧交替快，思想教育跟不上，也使农村党员对马列主义、共产主义信仰淡化，党组织的吸引力差了；党员思想教育工作的方式、方法与目前形势不相适应；有些党员经受不住改革、开放的考验，搞权钱交易，以权谋私，收受贿赂，无视党纪国法，不择手段地捞钱，加上制度不完善，党员违纪案件明显增多。
    蠡县县委面对这些新问题，积极探索，采取了一些有效措施：
    开展理想、宗旨教育。在教育工作中，他们改变过去那种“千人一剂，万人一方”的作法，分层、分行业施教，增强针对性、实效性。为使教育形象化、具体化，县委采用多种形式宣传辛兴村党总支一班人时刻不忘全心全意为人民服务的宗旨的事迹。在辛兴村，先富帮后富已成为共产党员的自觉行动，有近百名党员主动为贫困户转让项目8个，提供资金23万元，为修建村医院、教学楼、农民文化活动中心等集体福利事业，全村党员自动捐款，在他们的影响下，群众也纷纷捐款。
    开展反贪倡廉、艰苦奋斗教育。首先，县委从自身抓起，实行“两公开一监督”制度，将招干、转工等一些群众最敏感的问题“曝光”，让群众监督，起表率作用。其次，从职能部门抓起，分行业明确职责，形成制度，加强监督，对一些机关存在的不廉洁问题，认真查处。去年，在反腐败斗争中，共清理党政机关行政性公司15个，查结案件32件，查出违纪金额21万元，严肃处理了13名违纪党员。
    树立新的用人观。新时期农村基层干部，不仅党性要强，作风要正派，有较高的政治素质，而且要有较强的商品经济意识，能够带领群众治穷致富。他们根据这一标准，对农村支部进行调整，大胆提拔任用那些政治素质好，具有商品经济意识、领导才能和致富本领的党员，为农村支部注入活力。
    壮大集体经济实力，增强支部的对内凝聚力和对外吸引力。从1985年县委号召全县农村支部兴办集体企业、壮大集体经济到现在，农村集体企业已发展到175个。永兴庄村过去集体经济实力不足，村里学校校舍年久失修，群众吃水困难。1986年，村支部先后兴办了三个集体企业，村集体年收入200多万元。随后投资15万元修建教学楼，家家户户安上了自来水。另外，村里还将群众的水、电费用和土地税等全部包下来。村支部对群众既说实在话，又办实在事，党员群众看在眼里，自身受益，心自然贴紧村支部。现在，村里开党员或群众会，喇叭一喊，一会儿便齐。
    坚持党员权利与义务相统一原则。加强党内民主制度建设，使每个党员既能认真履行党员义务，又能充分行使权利，使党组织有了较强的凝聚力和战斗力。辛兴、刘庄、大百尺、武家营等村党支部，凡涉及全村的大事，首先召开党员大会进行讨论，统一思想后再进行实施。村干部说：“过去只讲义务，党员心里气不顺，事事难办；现在，既讲义务又尊重党员权利，气顺心齐，事事好开展了。”
