The U.S. government recently notified the Danish government that it will abandon the naval base at Thule Air Base in Greenland, while retaining the radar warning base at the northern end of the island and the radar station in the east.

The U.S. government explained that the main reason for adjusting the U.S. military deployment in Greenland is the reduction in the defense budget.

The Thule Air Base is located in southwestern Greenland and was established by the United States during World War II. It served as an important part of the U.S. transportation and supply network to Europe. After the war, the base became an important domestic and international airport in Greenland and a major U.S. base.

Since April 1941, under the "Greenland Defense Agreement" signed by Denmark and the United States, the United States has obtained the right to build military facilities on the island.

    美调整在格陵兰军事部署
    本报斯德哥尔摩7月11日电　记者顾耀铭报道：美国政府最近通知丹麦政府，它将放弃在格陵兰岛上的桑德拉·斯特龙费尔德海军基地，保留在该岛北端的图勒雷达预警基地及东部的雷达站。
    美国政府解释，对美军在格陵兰军事部署调整的主要原因是国防预算的削减。
    桑德拉·斯特龙费尔德基地位于格陵兰西南，是美国在第二次世界大战期间建立的，曾作为美国通往欧洲的交通和补给网的重要部分。大战结束后，该基地成为格陵兰重要的国内和国际机场，也是美国的主要基地。
    从1941年4月开始，根据丹麦与美国签订的“格陵兰防务协定”，美国取得了在岛上建立军事设施的权利。
