Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, July 25th.

From July 10th to 13th, the Industrial and Commercial Administration Bureaus of Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, and Shijiazhuang City, Hebei Province, jointly took action to shut down and seal off more than 200 illegal coal trafficking points along the highway from Yangquan to Shijiazhuang. They seized over 10,000 tons of illegally operated coal.

In recent years, as the amount of coal transported from Shanxi via public roads has increased, some unscrupulous merchants along the highway from Yangquan to Shijiazhuang have opened restaurants, shops, and inns as fronts. They use various means such as providing meals, cigarettes, and alcohol, and offering low prices to lure truck drivers into partnering with them to sell coal illegally. It is estimated that they traffic over 100,000 tons of coal each year, severely damaging state interests and corrupting social morals.

    阳石公路非法贩煤点被取缔
    据新华社太原7月25日电　7月10日至13日，山西省阳泉市工商局和河北省石家庄市工商局联合行动，取缔、查封了阳泉至石家庄公路沿线的200多个违法贩煤摊点，查获非法经营的煤炭达万余吨。
    近年来，随着公路晋煤外运量的增加，阳泉至石家庄公路沿线，一些不法商贩纷纷以开饭店、商店、旅店为名，用饭、烟酒、低价收购等多种手段，引诱汽车司机与他们合伙倒卖煤炭。据统计，每年经他们倒卖的煤炭高达10万多吨，严重损害了国家利益，败坏了社会风气。
