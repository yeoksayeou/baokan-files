Your newspaper published an investigative report titled "The House Controversy" on December 10, 1988, on page 5. The report exposed how Liu Guoxi, the head of the Transportation Bureau in Chaoyang County, Liaoning, along with the bureau's deputy secretary, Cui Jingyun, and deputy head, Deng Shulai, misappropriated large sums of funds to buy houses for themselves. They also retaliated against financial personnel who adhered to financial regulations and exposed the issues. Additionally, the joint investigation team from Chaoyang City and Chaoyang County's Supervision Bureau covered up the misconduct. Five months have passed, and the three financial personnel who stood by their principles have not only not been reinstated to their financial positions but have also been subjected to retaliation. Meanwhile, the corrupt officials Liu Guoxi, Cui Jingyun, and Deng Shulai continue to hold their positions, and the houses they bought with public funds remain occupied. We urge the relevant departments to restore our financial positions as soon as possible. At the same time, we hope that the Party and the government will protect the initiative of the masses in the fight against corruption and support the masses in their struggle against bad practices.

    何日恢复我们的工作
    你报1988年12月10日第五版刊登了记者采写的信访调查《房子风波》，披露了辽宁朝阳县交通局长刘国玺、局党委副书记崔景云、副局长邓树来等人动用巨额专款为自己买房，对坚持财会制度和揭发问题的财会人员打击报复的问题，以及朝阳市和朝阳县监察局联合调查组包庇违纪者的有关情况。5个月过去了，我们坚持原则的3名财会人员不但没有被恢复财会工作，反而遭到打击。而违纪的刘国玺、崔景玉、邓树来照样当官，用专款买的房子仍照住不误。请有关部门早日恢复我们的财会工作。同时，我们希望党和政府在反腐败现象中，保护群众的积极性，支持群众同歪风邪气进行斗争。
