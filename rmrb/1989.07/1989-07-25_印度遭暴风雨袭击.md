India's western state of Maharashtra was hit by a tornado and heavy rain yesterday, leaving at least 100 people dead, many missing, and all transportation and communication disrupted.

According to information received today, due to the ravages of the tornado and heavy rain, Mumbai, the capital of Maharashtra, has suspended all water, land, and air transportation since yesterday afternoon, effectively cutting off contact with the outside world.

The hardest-hit area is the town of Beed. In that town, 1,000 houses were washed away by floods caused by the heavy rain, and 34 people lost their lives.

Maharashtra's Chief Minister Sharad Pawar has convened an emergency meeting and decided to immediately send relief supplies to the affected areas. He has also ordered the use of warships and helicopters to rescue people stranded by the floods.
