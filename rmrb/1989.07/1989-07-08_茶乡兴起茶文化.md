The tea-producing region of Zhejiang Province is one of the birthplaces of Chinese tea culture. As early as the Southern Song Dynasty, the highest form of ancient tea culture, the "tea ceremony," was in full swing in Hangzhou. The famous Japanese "tea ceremony" art evolved from the "Jingshan Tea Banquet" in Hangzhou. In recent years, since the tea market opened, Zhejiang's tea culture has quietly revived.

Every time new tea hits the market, tea farmers from various tea-growing areas bring their locally famous teas, which they have carefully cultivated and meticulously processed, to participate in tea culture activities at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. These activities include tea competitions, tea evaluations, tea tasting sessions, tea festivals, spring tea banquets, and tea art performances. They invite some respected tea experts and scholars to form a judging panel to determine the rankings using coded scoring.

Zhejiang's tea culture activities have attracted the Taiwan Lu Yu Tea Art Culture Group to come to Hangzhou's Longjing Tea Village in May for a tea art performance, realizing the first tea culture exchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 40 years.

    茶乡兴起茶文化
    名茶之乡浙江省是我国茶文化的发祥地之一。早在南宋，作为古代茶文化最高表现形式的门茶活动就在杭州盛极一时，著名的日本“茶道”艺术就是在吸收杭州“径山茶宴”的基础上演变而成的。近几年茶市开放以后，浙江茶文化又悄然复兴。
    每当新茶应市，各茶区茶农带着辛勤培育、精心炒制的地方名茶，参加省、市、县不同层次的茶文化活动，主要有斗茶会、评茶会、品茗会、茶叶节、迎春茶宴、茶艺演出等等，他们请一些德高望重的茶叶专家、学者组成评委，以密码记分决定名次。
    浙江茶文化活动吸引了台湾陆羽茶艺文化团专程于5月来杭州龙井茶乡进行茶艺表演，实现了海峡两岸茶人40年来的第一次茶文化交流。
