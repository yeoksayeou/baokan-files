The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today that the Grenada government's announcement of "establishing diplomatic relations" with Taiwan violates the principles of the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Grenada.

Grenada and Taiwan announced the establishment of so-called "diplomatic relations" on July 20.

The spokesperson said, "It is well known that there is only one China in the world, and that is the People's Republic of China. Taiwan is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The Taiwan authorities are relentlessly pushing for so-called 'flexible diplomacy' in an attempt to undermine the friendly relations between countries that have established diplomatic relations with us, aiming to achieve their goal of escaping international isolation."

He said, "We firmly oppose this plot by the Taiwan authorities. The Grenada government's announcement of 'establishing diplomatic relations' with Taiwan violates the principles of the joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Grenada. Our ambassador to Grenada has lodged a serious protest with the Grenadian side. We hope that the Grenada government, in the interest of the overall situation of relations between the two countries, will correct this mistake as soon as possible."

    外交部发言人发表谈话
    评格林纳达同台湾“建交”
    新华社北京七月二十九日电　中国外交部发言人今天在这里指出，格林纳达政府宣布同台湾“建交”，违背了中格两国建交公报原则。
    格林纳达和台湾是于七月二十日宣布建立所谓“外交关系”的。
    外交部发言人说，“众所周知，世界上只有一个中国，这就是中华人民共和国，台湾是中国领土不可分割的一部分。台湾当局竭力推行所谓‘弹性外交’，企图破坏与我建交国家同我国的友好关系，以达到其摆脱国际上孤立的目的。”
    他说，“对台湾当局这一阴谋，我们是坚决反对的。格林纳达政府宣布同台湾‘建交’，违背了中格两国建交公报原则。我国兼驻格林纳达大使已向格方提出了严正交涉。我们希望格林纳达政府从维护两国关系的大局出发，尽快纠正这一错误。”
