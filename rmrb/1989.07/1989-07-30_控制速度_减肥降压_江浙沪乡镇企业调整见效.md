Adjustments in Rural Enterprises in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Show Effectiveness

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 30th (Reporters Yuan Yanghe, Sun Hongxiang, Xu Qun) The rectification and adjustment are like a good prescription, making the rural industries in the Yangtze River Delta begin to "reduce weight" and "lower pressure," gradually eliminating some of the "symptoms" caused by economic overheating, and moving towards a healthy development path.

Located in the Yangtze River Delta, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai are the birthplaces of China's rural industries and also the regions with the highest density of rural enterprises. Currently, they employ over 15 million workers. Among them, the industrial output value of rural industries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces accounts for more than half of the province's total industrial output value, and fiscal revenue accounts for one-third of the province's total revenue. The rise of rural industries has played a crucial role in promoting the development of the national economy and the stable growth of agricultural and sideline production in this region.

However, due to excessive fixed asset investments in recent years, some places have developed a trend of competing for output value and speed, even blindly expanding and engaging in debt-financed operations. As a result, many enterprises have excessive processing capacity, insufficient energy and raw materials, lagging management levels, and affected product quality and economic benefits.

Since last winter, the leadership at various levels in the two provinces and one municipality have placed the rectification and adjustment of rural enterprises in an important position, seriously discussing strategies for "reducing pressure and swelling." The rural industrial system in Jiangsu Province decided to achieve a new strategic transformation. Zhejiang Province's rural enterprises, starting from reality, quickly adjusted the investment structure, industrial structure, and product structure. Various places also strictly reduced fixed asset investments. Jiangsu Province's rural enterprises have reduced more than 3,700 fixed asset investment projects of 50,000 yuan or more since last year. Zhejiang Province has canceled more than 2,400 construction and planned projects, saving nearly 900 million yuan. Shanghai Municipality's rural enterprises have reduced construction investment by 1 billion yuan, and half of the 1,000 or so planned projects have been canceled.

The rectification and adjustment have effectively controlled the previously rapid development speed of rural enterprises. The industrial output value of Shanghai's rural industries in the first quarter of this year still increased by 42% compared to the same period last year. After April, it gradually decreased month by month, and by June, the growth rate of output value was only 20%. The industrial output value of rural industries in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has also been decreasing since the first quarter, with a growth rate of about 28% in April compared to the same period last year, and then decreasing to about 25% and 22% in May and June, respectively.

    控制速度　“减肥降压”
    江浙沪乡镇企业调整见效
    据新华社北京7月30日电  （记者袁养和、孙洪祥、许群）治理整顿犹如一帖良方，使长江三角洲乡镇工业开始“减肥”、“降压”，逐步消除经济过热带来的一些“病症”，走向良性发展道路。
    地处长江三角洲的江、浙、沪是我国乡镇工业发祥地，也是乡镇企业密度最大的地区，目前拥有职工1500余万。其中江、浙两省乡镇工业产值已占全省工业产值一半以上，财政收入也占全省总收入的1／3。乡镇工业的崛起对促进这一地区国民经济的发展和农副业生产的稳定增长都起了举足轻重的作用。
    但是，由于近些年来固定资产投资过大，一些地方出现了相互攀比产值、速度的风气，甚至盲目铺摊子，搞负债经营，致使不少企业加工能力过剩，能源和原材料无法保证，管理水平跟不上，影响了产品质量和经济效益。
    去冬以来，两省一市各级领导都把乡镇企业的治理整顿放到了重要位置，认真商讨“降压消肿”的良策。江苏省乡镇工业系统决定在战略上实现新的转变。浙江省各地乡镇企业从实际出发，迅速调整投资结构、产业结构和产品结构。各地还不折不扣地压缩固定资产投资。江苏省乡镇企业去年以来共压缩了5万元以上的固定资产投资项目3700多个。浙江省砍掉在建和准备上马的工程项目2400多个，共压缩资金9亿多元。上海市乡镇企业共压缩基建投资10亿元，原来准备上马的1000多个工程砍掉了一半。
    治理整顿，使原来乡镇企业过猛的发展速度得到了有效的控制。上海市今年一季度乡镇工业的产值还比去年同期增长42％。4月份以后逐月降低，到6月份产值增长的幅度只有20％。江、浙两省一季度以来，乡镇工业的产值也不断递减，4月份比去年同期增长28％左右，5月份和6月份又下降到25％和22％左右。
