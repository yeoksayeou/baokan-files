Since the beginning of summer, people waiting at bus stops in London often ask each other, "Is today a normal day or a strike day?" Those rushing to take the subway also frequently pause in front of signs at the station that read, "Strike today, no service." The frequent "wildcat" strikes have caused many inconveniences for people commuting to work. In Britain, where rail and road networks are as dense as a spider's web, people often lament, "Traveling is difficult this summer."

Yesterday, a one-day strike by London's bus workers just ended, but this morning, the 15th nationwide rail and London Underground strike, as well as a strike by local government employees across the country, began. The recent nationwide dock workers' strike has also not completely ended. The main goal of these strikes is to demand wage increases that exceed the rate of inflation and to improve working conditions. It is believed that this is the largest wave of strikes since the British coal miners' strike of 1984-1985. Although legal restrictions limit each strike to no more than 24 hours, the continuous waves of strikes, especially the weekly combined strikes by national rail, London Underground, and buses, have caused enormous economic losses. According to reports, by yesterday, the combined rail and Underground workers' strikes alone had already caused over 40 million pounds in losses.

The main cause of this large-scale strike is the significant rise in the inflation rate. Britain's inflation rate rose from 2.4% in June and July 1986 to the current 8.3%, placing it at the forefront of Western European countries. Last year, the average wage increase in Britain was 9%, but this year, the wage increase in public enterprises is only 7.5%, lower than in general private enterprises, thus sparking this wave of strikes. In the past month, the national railway union and the railway bureau have held multiple negotiations. The British Railway Bureau has proposed a solution to increase workers' wages by 8.8% and by around 11% for workers in the Southeast region, but this was rejected by the union. Thus, the situation has deteriorated again, and today, the nationwide railway workers' strike has erupted once more.

The recent wave of strikes in Britain, represented by the nationwide railway workers' strike, has posed a new challenge to the Conservative Party government. It is well known that for over a year, the British government has been plagued by the rising inflation rate. To curb inflation, the government has raised interest rates 10 times since last June, maintaining a high level of 14% as of this June, the highest among major Western industrialized countries. The government is concerned that if the railway workers' strike achieves its goals and wage increases exceed the inflation rate, it could trigger a chain reaction, with other public sectors also making similar demands. This would undermine the government's efforts over the past year to control inflation. According to reports, the government has stabilized the inflation rate in June and estimates that it may begin to decline starting in August. Therefore, Conservative Party members and government officials believe that the national railway union's rejection of the railway bureau's solution and demand for higher wage increases is an "irresponsible" stance that "will lose public sympathy nationwide."

To address this new challenge, Mrs. Thatcher has established a special cabinet committee to monitor the impact of the strikes and study government responses. The committee has asked the Employment Minister to consider legislation to limit the possibility of strikes in the public sector. In many Western countries, laws restrict strikes in the public sector. In the United States, public sector strikes are not allowed, and striking employees are punished; in many Western European countries, the law requires that basic services be maintained during strikes. The government is also trying to draft fines to make unions compensate enterprises for losses caused by strikes and to encourage labor-management agreements to avoid strikes. In summary, the Conservative Party government wants to consolidate and develop the achievements it has made in the past 10 years through legislation to limit union strikes.

As for whether the Conservative Party government's measures to deal with the strikes will be effective, some local newspapers hold a cautious attitude, but former Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit is quite confident, saying, "The unpleasant summer will disappear in the gentle sunlight."

    英伦今夏行路难
    本报记者　陈特安
    入夏以来，在伦敦的公共汽车站候车的人群经常互相发问：“今日是正常天还是罢工天？”赶乘地铁的人们也时常在站口那写有“今天罢工，没有服务”的告示牌前止步。此起彼伏的“野猫式”的罢工，给人们上下班带来诸多不便。在铁路、公路密如蛛网的英伦，今夏人们却常感叹“行路难”。
    昨天，为时一天的伦敦全市公共汽车职工大罢工刚刚结束，今晨，全国铁路、伦敦地铁职工第15次大罢工以及全国各地方政府公务员大罢工又宣布开始。日前爆发的全国码头工人罢工也未完全结束。这些罢工的主要目标是要求工资的增加幅度高于通货膨胀的水平，改善工作条件。据认为，这是1984年至1985年英国煤矿工人大罢工以来最大的一起工潮。虽然由于法律限制，每次罢工时间不得超过24小时，但迭起的工潮，尤其是全国铁路、伦敦地铁、公共汽车每周一次的联合罢工造成了巨大的经济损失。据报道，到昨天为止，仅铁路、地铁工人联合罢工一项，就已造成4000多万英镑的损失。
    引起这场大罢工的主要原因是通货膨胀率大幅度回升。英国通货膨胀率从1986年6至7月份的2.4％上升到目前的8.3％，处于西欧国家的前列。去年英国平均工资增幅为9％，但今年公共企业工资增幅只有7.5％，低于一般私营企业，于是引起了这次工潮。近一个月来，全国铁路工会与铁路局举行多次谈判，英国铁路局已提出增加职工工资8.8％、东南部地区职工增加11％左右的解决方案，但遭到工会方面的拒绝。于是形势又急转直下，今天全国性铁路工人大罢工再度爆发。
    以英国铁路工人全国大罢工为代表的英国近期工潮对保守党政府形成了新的挑战。人所共知，一年多来，英国政府一直受到通货膨胀率回升的困扰，为了抑制通货膨胀，政府从去年6月以来连续10次提高利率，到今年6月仍维持在14％的高水平，居西方主要工业国家之首。英国政府担心，如果这次铁路工人罢工达到目的，工资增加幅度高于通货膨胀率，那么还可能引起连锁反应，其它公共部门的也会提出类似的要求。这样，政府一年多来遏制通货膨胀的努力将付之东流。据报道，6月份政府已稳住通货膨胀率，估计8月份起可能开始下降。因此，保守党议员和政府官员认为，全国铁路工会拒绝铁路局的解决方案，要求更高的工资增幅，是一种“不负责任”的立场，“将会在全国公众面前失去同情”。
    为对付这种新的挑战，撒切尔夫人已成立了一个内阁特别委员会，监察罢工影响，研究政府对策。委员会已要求就业大臣考虑通过立法限制公共部门罢工的可能性。在西方不少国家的法律对公共部门的罢工都有限制，美国不允许公共部门的罢工，雇佣人员罢工是要被惩处的；西欧许多国家，司法上要求在罢工时，要保证最基本的服务。政府还试图制订罚款条例，要工会向企业赔偿罢工造成的损失，并试图鼓励劳资双方签订非罢工协定等等。总之，保守党政府想巩固和发展它过去10年通过立法限制工会罢工取得的成果。
    至于保守党政府对付工潮措施能否奏效，此间的一些报刊持审慎态度，但保守党前主席诺曼·特比特则颇有信心地说：“令人不快的夏天将在柔和的阳光中消失。”　（本报伦敦7月18日电）
