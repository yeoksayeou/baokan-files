The Western Seven Nations Summit concluded early today after adopting economic and political declarations. The political declaration grossly interfered in China's internal affairs.

Our reporter Zhang Qihua and Lü Wangda report from Paris on July 16th: The Western Seven Nations Summit concluded today after adopting an economic declaration. The declaration, read by President Mitterrand at the plenary session, is 23 pages long and consists of 56 points. Yesterday, the leaders reached a consensus on the main issues of the declaration during the plenary session.

The Western Seven Nations Summit spent an entire day discussing political issues yesterday and adopted four political declarations on human rights, counter-terrorism, East-West relations, and the so-called "China issue."

In the declaration on East-West relations, Western countries hope that the Soviet government will turn its new internal and external policies and its disarmament declarations into concrete actions. The Soviet Union's massive military power poses a threat to any country in the Eurasian continent, and Western countries must remain vigilant and maintain adequate defensive forces. The seven nations reiterated that the United States and the Soviet Union should engage in substantial reductions in strategic nuclear weapons.

According to reports, since the attending leaders had reached a consensus on supporting reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, particularly in Poland and Hungary, environmental protection, and resolving the debt issues of Third World countries, the meeting concluded half a day earlier than scheduled.

It should be noted that the political declaration issued on July 15th distorted facts, confused cause and effect, and unjustly criticized China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots. This is a blatant and unreasonable interference in China's internal affairs, which is unacceptable.

The next Western Seven Nations Summit is scheduled to be held in the United States next year.

### 西方七国首脑会议提前闭幕  会议通过经济和政治宣言  政治宣言粗暴干涉我内政

    西方七国首脑会议提前闭幕
    会议通过经济和政治宣言  政治宣言粗暴干涉我内政
    本报巴黎7月16日电　记者张启华、吕网大报道，西方七国首脑会议今日中午通过了经济宣言后，宣告本届会议结束。
    这个宣言是由密特朗总统在全体会议上宣读的，全文长达23页，共56点。在昨晚举行的全体会议上，首脑们已经就宣言的主要问题达成一致看法。
    西方七国首脑会议昨天用一整天时间讨论了政治问题，并通过了关于人权、反恐怖活动、东西方关系和所谓中国问题的四项政治声明。
    在关于东西方关系的声明中，西方国家希望苏联政府将其对内和对外的新政策和它的裁军声明变为具体的行动，因为苏联庞大的军事力量对欧亚大陆的任何国家都是一种威胁，西方国家必须继续提高警惕，维持相当的防卫力量。七国重申美苏两国应在战略核武器方面进行实质性的裁减。
    据报道，由于与会首脑在支持苏联和东欧，特别是波兰、匈牙利的改革、环境保护以及解决第三世界国家债务等问题已取得了一致看法，因此，会议提前半天结束。
    需要指出的是，会议在15日发表的政治宣言中，歪曲事实，本末倒置，对中国平息反革命暴乱横加指责，这是对中国内政毫无道理的粗暴干涉，是不能接受的。
    下一届西方七国首脑会议定于明年在美国举行。
