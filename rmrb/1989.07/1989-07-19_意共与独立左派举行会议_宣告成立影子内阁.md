The Italian Communist Party and the Independent Left parliamentary group held a full meeting today in Rome to formally announce the formation of a "shadow cabinet."

The "prime minister" of the aforementioned shadow cabinet is the general secretary of the Italian Communist Party, Occhietto, with a total of 21 "ministers," including 16 from the Italian Communist Party and 5 from the Independent Left.

Occhietto introduced the platform of the shadow cabinet at the meeting. Occhietto said that the task of the shadow cabinet is "not only to monitor the government, but also to take on the responsibility of proposing suggestions and making choices." In terms of foreign policy, the platform of the shadow cabinet calls for Italy to take more vigorous initiatives to seek new solutions to major issues facing the world, such as the environment, development, drug abuse, and especially North-South relations. It also proposes goals such as full political and economic integration of Europe, a common policy towards the East, and accelerating all disarmament negotiations. In terms of the economy, it emphasizes the necessity of managing public finances and reforming the tax system. The shadow cabinet will make suggestions in this regard and also emphasizes the need to prioritize environmental protection and the issue of the South. In terms of institutional reform, it emphasizes the necessity of reforming the electoral system, advocating for voters to directly vote for the parliamentary majority that organizes the coalition government, changing the bicameral system to a unicameral system, and reforming the municipal election law.
