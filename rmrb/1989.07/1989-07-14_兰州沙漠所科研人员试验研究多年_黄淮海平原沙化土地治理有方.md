Researchers from the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have, after many years of experimental research, found an effective way to develop and treat desertified land in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, which is prone to disasters and has low productivity.

In the vast Huang-Huai-Hai Plain, including the old course of the Yellow River and coastal areas, there are a total of 31 million mu (approximately 2.07 million hectares) of land that is difficult to cultivate due to wind erosion, and more than 70 million mu (approximately 4.67 million hectares) of farmland that is threatened by wind erosion. During the "Sixth Five-Year Plan" and "Seventh Five-Year Plan" periods, the state listed Huang-Huai-Hai agriculture as a key research and development project. Under the unified arrangement of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Lanzhou Desert Research Institute dispatched more than 40 senior and mid-level researchers to Shandong's Yucheng, Xujin, and Henan's Yanjin, setting up camps on the front lines of wind and sand. They combined the characteristics of the desertified land in the Huang-Huai-Hai Plain and conducted multi-disciplinary coordinated experimental research. They finally proposed a set of comprehensive technical measures of "water conservancy first, land leveling, fruit and grain (cotton) intercropping in a grid pattern, short-term cultivation to support long-term growth, land use and land improvement combined," and determined the treatment policy of "fruit industry as the main focus, with agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline production developing in an integrated manner." They also selected fruit tree, crop, tree, and grass species suitable for wind-eroded land and formulated comprehensive plans for the development and treatment of sandy land in various demonstration areas. Farmers in Yucheng, Shandong, developed and treated 13,000 mu (approximately 867 hectares) of wind-eroded land in just three years.

    兰州沙漠所科研人员试验研究多年
    黄淮海平原沙化土地治理有方
    据新华社兰州7月14日电  （记者王昌）中国科学院兰州沙漠研究所科研人员经过多年试验研究，为我国黄淮海多灾低产区沙化土地开发治理找到了一条有效途径。
    在辽阔的黄淮海平原，包括黄河故道和滨海地区在内，总共有3100万亩难以耕种的风沙化土地和7000多万亩受风蚀危害的农田。“六·五”和“七·五”期间，国家把黄淮海农业列为重点科研攻关课题，在中国科学院统一部署下，兰州沙漠研究所派出40多名高、中级科研人员来到山东禹城、夏津和河南延津等地，在风沙前沿安营扎寨。他们结合黄淮海平原沙化土地的特点，经过多学科配套试验研究，终于提出一套以开发推动治理的“水利先行，平整土地、林网化果粮（棉）间作，以短养长，用地养地，养用结合”的综合技术措施，确定了“果业为主，农、林、牧、副综合发展”的治理方针，并且筛选出适合风沙化土地生长的果树、作物品种和树种、草种，为各个示范区制订出了综合开发治理沙地的方案。山东禹城农民三年时间就开发治理风沙化土地1.3万亩。
