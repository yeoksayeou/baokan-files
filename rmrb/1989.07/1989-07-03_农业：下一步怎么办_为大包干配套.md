How can agriculture quickly break out of its current stagnation? I believe that we should focus on complementary reforms around the household contract responsibility system to enhance agricultural comprehensive production capacity.

1. Legislation: Protect the Household Contract Responsibility System
Originally, the 1984 Central Document No. 1 proposed that the "household contract responsibility system should be stabilized, and the land contract period should generally be more than 15 years." However, over the past few years, the actual implementation has given farmers many contrary experiences. Now, there is an urgent need for legislation to protect farmers' contract rights and management rights, strictly limit "land seizures," regulate levies, and use laws to set the maximum limit for levies, stabilizing farmers' burdens, etc., so that farmers truly have a sense of stability.

The household contract responsibility system is an innovation in the history of world agricultural economics and socialism, and a successful example of "two separations" under public ownership. The stagnation of agriculture is not its "fault." It still has both vitality and potential. The problem is that after implementing the household contract responsibility system, the complementary reforms have not kept up in a timely manner.

2. Investment: Establish a Farmer-Dominated Investment Mechanism
After the transformation of agricultural management forms, the original collective economic investment mechanism has lost its function, and the farmer-dominated investment mechanism based on household operations has not yet fully formed. Therefore, although the enthusiasm for dispersed investment by households is not low, there is a high demand for fertilizers, pesticides, films, agricultural machinery, draft animals, and small tools, but investments that require unified input by households, such as water conservancy, agricultural infrastructure, roads, warehouses, and agricultural industries, have significantly decreased. This is not because farmers lack investment capabilities; currently, rural savings and farmers' cash holdings are approximately over 150 billion yuan. Farmers do not invest because the farmer-dominated investment mechanism for unified input has not been established.

Now, in some places, a preliminary farmer labor accumulation fund investment system and various fund organizations have been established, converting farmers' labor surplus and financial surplus into investment and accumulation, and have already become a trial or embryonic form of the farmer-dominated investment mechanism, showing a trend of rapid development. We should further support its development and improvement.

3. Services: Urban-Rural and Up-Down "Integration," "Grand Chorus"
The service system supporting household operations has been advocated for several years, but it has not truly been established. The fundamental reason is that the coordination of urban-rural and up-down interests has not been well managed. Basic-level township and village collective economic organizations cannot operate without the support and coordination of upper-level economic departments and their urban-rural systems and channels.

Of course, the coordination of overall urban-rural interests and national economic sector interests still awaits the deepening of urban reforms and the improvement of macro-control. However, the practices of provinces like Liaoning and Shandong, and cities and counties like Suzhou, Xiangfan, and Zhangpu over the past few years have shown that it is not necessary to wait for the "big environment" to change before promoting coordination in this area. In fact, whether from the perspective of a province, a prefecture, or a county, under current conditions, each can take action in this area to a certain extent, carry out coordination work to a certain degree, and achieve remarkable results.

4. Market: Enhance National Regulatory Capacity
Since early 1985, agricultural product prices have been gradually liberalized, expanding market regulation, allowing farmers to produce according to the law of value through market exchange, and already achieving great success in utilizing market mechanisms in rural areas. It is just that this reform process has slowed down due to the emergence of inflation. However, the role of the market mechanism is undoubtedly beneficial in overcoming agricultural stagnation. After the rectification and control efforts have achieved results, the expansion of the market mechanism should be continued.

The development and utilization of the socialist market mechanism depend on the maturity of the national regulatory capacity. Currently, the disorder and chaos manifested by the market mechanism are a reflection of the immaturity of the national regulatory and management capacity for the market. The ongoing rectification and control work provides an opportunity for the country to explore and accumulate experience in regulating and managing the market, improving this capacity.

5. Science and Technology: Enhance Agricultural Comprehensive Production Capacity
Comprehensive production capacity should include a combination of agricultural technological and economic levels, rural social and cultural levels, and farmers' quality and psychological levels, which interact to produce development capacity. Of course, the key is the application of modern science and technology in agriculture; science and technology are the primary productive force.

In summary, a comprehensive approach is needed to address agricultural stagnation. Improve the unfavorable factors for agriculture due to natural, economic, and social constraints, making it adapt to the development of the national economy and the improvement of social life.

    农业：下一步怎么办
    ——为大包干配套
    黄道霞
    农业，如何尽快突破徘徊局面？我认为：应当围绕家庭联产承包制进行配套改革，提高农业综合生产能力。
    1、立法：保护家庭联产承包责任制
    本来，1984年中央1号文件就提出了“稳定联产承包责任制，土地承包期一般应在15年以上”。但是，几年来在实际动作上却给了农民许多相反的感受。现在，迫切需要立法：认真保护农民的承包权、经营权，严格限制“夺佃”；管制提留，用法律规定提留的最高限额，稳定农民负担；等等；使农民真正有稳定感。
    联产承包制，是世界农业经济史上和社会主义史上的创举，是公有制下成功实现“两权分离”的典范。农业徘徊，不是它的“罪过”。它现在仍然既有活力，又有潜力。问题是发生在实行联产承包制后，与它配套的改革，还不能及时跟上。
    2、投入：建立农民主权投入机制
    农业经营形式变革后，原来集体经济投入机制失去作用，而农户经营为基础的农民主权投入机制没有完全形成。所以尽管农户分散投入方面的积极性不低，化肥、农药、薄膜、农机、耕畜、小型农具供不应求，但需要农户统一投入的，如水利、农田基本建设、公路、仓库、农用工业等投资却大大减少，这并非农民没有投入能力，现在农村储蓄和农民手持现金大约已达1500亿元以上。农民不投，只是因为统一投入方面，农民主权投入机制没有建立起来。
    现在，有些地方，初步建立起农民劳动积累工投入制度和各种基金会组织，把农民的劳动剩余、资金剩余转化为投入、积累，并已成为农民主权投入机制的一种试验或雏形，呈方兴未艾之势。应当进一步支持其发展、完善。
    3、服务：城乡、上下“一体化”、“大合唱”
    支持农户家庭经营的服务体系，已经提倡了好几年，可是，并没有真正建立起来。根本原因在于没有协调好城乡、上下利益关系。基层乡村集体经营组织，没有上层经济业务部门及其城乡体系、渠道的配套、配合，就运转不起来。
    当然，整个城乡利益、国民经济各部门利益的协调，还有待于城市改革的深化和宏观调控的完善。但是，这几年辽宁、山东等省、苏州、襄樊、漳浦等市县的实践表明，也不一定非要等“大气候”改了才能推进这方面的协调工作，实际上，无论从一个省、一个专区或一个县的范围来说，在现时条件下，各自也都可以在这方面有所作为，进行一定程度的协调工作，取得显著成绩。
    4、市场：增强国家调控能力
    本来，从1985年初，就开始逐步放开农产品价格，扩大了市场调节，农民可以通过市场交换，按价值规律生产，已经使农村在利用市场机制方面取得了巨大成绩。只是这一改革进程，由于出现通货膨胀而放慢了步伐。但市场机制作用的发挥，无疑对克服农业徘徊有利。在整顿治理取得成效后，应当继续推进市场机制的扩大。
    社会主义市场机制发育、利用的程度，取决于国家调控能力成熟的程度。当前，市场机制表现出来的无序、紊乱现象，正是国家调控、管理市场能力不成熟的反映。现在进行的整顿、治理工作，正好为国家探索、积累调控、管理市场经验，提高这方面的能力，提供了机会。
    5、科技：农业综合生产能力提高
    综合生产能力，应包括：农业技术经济水平、农村社会文化水平、农民素质心理水平等集合体相互作用产生的发展生产能力。当然，其中关键的是现代科学技术在农业的应用，科技是第一生产力。
    总之，对农业徘徊要进行综合治理。改善由于自然、经济和社会的制约给农业带来的不利因素。使其适应国民经济的发展及社会生活的提高。
