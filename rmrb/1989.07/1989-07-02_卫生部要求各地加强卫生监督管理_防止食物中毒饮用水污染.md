Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, July 2nd.

The Ministry of Health recently issued an emergency notice, requiring local health administrative departments to strengthen health supervision and management to prevent the occurrence of food poisoning and drinking water contamination incidents.

The notice stated that since the beginning of summer, food poisoning and drinking water contamination incidents have frequently occurred in various places, directly threatening the lives of the people. From April to mid-June, there were 16 incidents of food poisoning involving more than 100 people or resulting in deaths, affecting 1,362 people and causing 47 deaths. The situation of drinking water contamination is also serious. For example, in mid-June, a residential area in Shenyang City experienced an outbreak of intestinal infectious diseases affecting 517 people due to the contamination of a secondary pressurized water tank by domestic sewage.

The notice pointed out that local authorities should learn from these incidents, strengthen health supervision and management, and take targeted preventive measures.

The notice requires local authorities to strictly implement the Food Hygiene Law and other relevant regulations. Local health administrative departments should regularly supervise relevant departments to strictly require food production, operation units, and water supply units to fulfill their legal responsibilities and do a good job in their own system's and unit's health work. Local health supervision agencies should strengthen the monitoring and inspection of food and drinking water hygiene, and guide the hygiene management work of food production and operation units and individuals, as well as water supply units. Appropriately increase the monitoring density of drinking water hygiene, strictly implement the living drinking water hygiene standards, and pay special attention to strengthening the hygiene management of self-supplied water sources and secondary pressurized water supply. Strictly implement the food production and operation hygiene permit and health certificate system.
