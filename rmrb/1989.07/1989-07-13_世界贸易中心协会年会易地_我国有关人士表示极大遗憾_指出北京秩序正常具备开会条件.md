	The chairman of the Beijing World Trade Center, Zhang Ming, issued a statement today expressing "great regret" over the decision to change the venue of the 20th annual meeting of the World Trade Center Association.

	At the Paris spring meeting of the World Trade Center Association in 1988, it was decided that the 20th annual meeting would be held in Beijing in September this year. This decision was confirmed at the Mumbai meeting in November 1988 and the Mexico meeting in April 1989. The board of directors of the World Trade Center Association also listened to and approved the detailed reports on the preparations for the annual meeting submitted by the Beijing World Trade Center on two occasions. However, at a special board meeting held in New York on July 5 this year, the association decided to change the venue to Geneva, Switzerland.

	Zhang Ming said, "The Beijing World Trade Center has always adhered to the principles of the World Trade Center Association, which are: regardless of country or region, not interfering with the political views and beliefs of members, and promoting economic and trade cooperation among economic organizations around the world."

	He said that China began preparations for the 20th annual meeting a year ago. By the end of May this year, 270 representatives from 23 countries and regions had registered for the conference. The venues, hotels, and various activities for the conference had all been arranged.

	He also said: Currently, the social order in Beijing has returned to normal and will continue to stabilize, fully meeting the conditions for holding the annual meeting and ensuring that foreign friends can carry out various business activities normally.

    世界贸易中心协会年会易地
    我国有关人士表示极大遗憾
    指出北京秩序正常具备开会条件
    新华社北京7月13日电　（记者赖云川）北京世界贸易中心理事长张明今天发表声明，对世界贸易中心协会第20届年会改变开会地点表示“极大的遗憾”。
    1988年世界贸易中心协会巴黎春季理事会上决定，今年9月在北京召开第20届年会，并在1988年11月孟买会议及1989年4月墨西哥会议上得到确定。世界贸易中心协会理事会还两次听取和批准了北京世界贸易中心就年会筹备工作所做的详细汇报。但是，今年7月5日这个协会在美国纽约举行的理事会特别会议决定，将年会改在瑞士日内瓦举行。
    张明说，“北京世界贸易中心一贯遵循世贸中心协会宗旨，即：不分国家与地区、不干涉会员的政治态度和信仰，以促进世界各地的经济组织之间的经济贸易合作为己任。”
    他说，中国从一年前就开始了第20届年会的筹备工作，到今年5月底，已经接受23个国家和地区的270名代表的正式注册登记，为大会选择的会场、旅馆和各项活动安排均已落实。
    他还说：目前，北京的社会秩序已恢复正常，并将进一步稳定，完全具备召开年会的条件，可以保障外国朋友正常开展各种业务活动。
