On May 21, Soviet Marshal Akhromeyev appeared in the meeting room of the U.S. House of Representatives Military Committee, speaking eloquently about Soviet military thought, military spending, and disarmament positions. A Soviet marshal testifying in the U.S. Congress was unprecedented; moreover, this marshal was the former Chief of the Soviet General Staff and currently serves as military advisor to Soviet leader Gorbachev. Therefore, major newspapers like the Washington Post and the New York Times the next day prominently featured the news and a large photo of the marshal testifying.

On the same day, a Soviet naval fleet entered the military port of Norfolk, southeast of the U.S. capital, where it received a 21-gun salute at this, the largest U.S. military facility. Led by Vice Admiral Kasatonov of the Soviet Northern Fleet, this fleet of three ships carried 1,000 personnel. They were invited to this U.S. Atlantic Fleet base for a 5-day friendly visit. This was the first time in 14 years that a Soviet naval fleet visited a U.S. port.

These two unusual events happening on the same day might be a coincidence, but they vividly reflected the improving relations between the two superpowers.

However, there is another side to the story. In the six months since the Bush administration took office, the leaders of the two superpowers have engaged in a series of interesting "cross visits." Gorbachev visited Britain, West Germany, and France, while Bush visited Poland and Hungary. This was no coincidence but a carefully arranged diplomatic maneuver: seeing that the 40-year-old Cold War barrier in Europe was difficult to maintain, one side advocated building a "European house," while the other demanded a "free and united Europe." Essentially, both sides aimed to expand their influence and exclude the other while dismantling the barrier.

This means that the current U.S.-Soviet relations are still two-sided, not one-sided. The improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations and the trend towards détente are undeniable facts, as this trend is not determined by the goodwill of any individual but by the practical difficulties and urgent needs of both sides. Objectively speaking, it can also be said to be a necessary development in post-war history.

However, the two-polar structure of international relations formed after the war has not yet completely disintegrated. The rivalry between these two superpowers will not fundamentally change in the foreseeable future, which means that their struggle will not end anytime soon—from this perspective, the view that the Cold War is not over is not without reason, although the old forms and language of the Cold War are becoming increasingly outdated.

    现时的美苏关系
    新华社记者　吴晋
    5月21日，苏联元帅阿赫罗梅耶夫出现在美国众议院军事委员会的会议室里，就苏联的军事思想、军费开支、裁军立场等问题，侃侃而谈。一位苏联元帅到美国国会作证，这本身就是破天荒第一遭；何况这位元帅还是前苏军参谋总长，现任苏联最高领导人戈尔巴乔夫的军事顾问。因此，《华盛顿邮报》和《纽约时报》等大报次日均以显著地位刊载了这一消息和这位元帅作证时的大幅照片。
    同一天，一支苏联海军舰队驶入美国首都东南的诺福克军港，在美国这个最大的军事设施受到了21响礼炮的欢迎。由苏联北方舰队第一副总司令卡萨托诺夫海军中将率领的这支有三艘舰只组成的舰队，载有1000名官兵。他们是应邀到这个美国大西洋舰队母港来作为期5天的友好访问的。苏联舰队访问美国港口，这是14年来第一次。
    这两起不寻常的事发生在同一天可能是巧合，但是却生动地反映了这两个超级大国关系的改善。
    但是，问题还有另外一面。布什政府上台后半年来，美苏两个超级大国的首脑进行了一系列有趣的“交叉访问”。戈尔巴乔夫先后访问了英国、西德和法国，布什则访问了波兰和匈牙利。这可不是巧合，而是精心安排的一场外交战：眼见40年冷战在欧洲形成的樊篱难以维持，于是一方鼓吹建立一所“欧洲大厦”，另一方要求建立一个“自由统一的欧洲”，骨子里都是想在拆篱笆时趁势扩张自己、排挤对方。
    这就是说，当前的美苏关系仍有其两面性，而不是一边倒。美苏关系在改善，缓和势头在发展，这是不容争辩的事实，因为决定这一趋势的不是某个人的善意，而是出自双方各自的实际困难和迫切需要。从客观看，也可说是战后历史发展的必然。
    但是，战后形成的国际关系的两极结构还没有完全解体，这两个超级大国互为对手的格局在可以预见的将来还不会完全改变，这就决定了它们之间的争斗一时不会终止——从这个意义上说，认为冷战尚未成为过去的说法不无道理，虽然以往的冷战形式、冷战语言已越来越不时兴。
