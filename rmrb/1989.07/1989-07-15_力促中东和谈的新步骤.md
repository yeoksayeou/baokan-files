British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe yesterday broke with protocol by meeting with Yasser Arafat's political advisor, Bashir Abu Sharif, at the Foreign Office. This unexpected meeting has drawn attention from various quarters. Local media generally believe that this is a symbol of the "upgrading" of British-Palestinian relations, indicating that Britain is taking a new, positive step to promote Middle East peace talks.

The British government has broken with the usual practice of having only deputy ministers meet with PLO officials, with a cabinet minister now meeting with a high-ranking official from the organization. This is closely related to the current Middle East peace process reaching a new crossroads. Looking at the Middle East, the PLO has changed its strategy, acknowledging Israel's right to exist; direct dialogue channels between the U.S. and the PLO have been opened; Western Europe and the Arab-Israeli sides are in frequent dialogue; Arab countries are also unanimously promoting Middle East peace talks. However, in early July, the Shamir government, to appease the hardliners within the Likud Party, unilaterally modified the cabinet-approved election plan for Palestinians in the occupied territories, emphasizing that 140,000 Palestinians in Jerusalem have no right to vote, reiterating the continued expansion of Jewish settlements, and stating that elections cannot be held unless the uprising is suppressed, and not recognizing the PLO or engaging in dialogue with it. The Shamir government has significantly retreated from its original position, effectively blocking the door to Middle East peace talks.

According to the *Times*, the British Foreign Office believes that if the conditions imposed by the Likud Party's right wing on the "Shamir Plan" become the official policy of the Israeli government, it "will put the peace process in an even more difficult situation." At this critical moment, Howe's meeting with a high-ranking PLO official is essentially a signal, indicating the British government's "serious concern" about the dimming prospects for the Middle East peace process.

During the meeting, Howe told Sharif that the British government agrees with the "Shamir Plan" and has been working for this peace process, and that the "conditions" imposed by the Likud Party are "unacceptable." He encouraged the PLO to adhere to the moderate political program issued last November and expressed that Britain "will do its best to save" the retreat in the Middle East peace process caused by the Likud Party. Sharif emphasized that the PLO will continue to adhere to its commitment to the peace process, but the situation in the occupied territories should be closely watched. He said that the PLO has not completely ruled out Israel's plan, but elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cannot be held under the "conditions" imposed by the Likud Party's right wing.

The British government's move is also akin to sounding an alarm and showing a red light to the right wing of the Israeli Likud Party. According to reports, the Whitehall has made it clear that Britain will continue to adhere to the consensus reached at the Madrid Summit of the European Community, that is, the PLO should "join" the Middle East peace process; Britain is also prepared to call for preparations to be made as soon as possible for an international peace conference on the Middle East issue. The British government's position is obviously incompatible with the stance of the Likud Party's right wing.

According to Middle East observers here, the first ministerial-level contact between Britain and the PLO, as well as the various forms of talks that are gradually strengthening, "may eventually lead to a meeting with Arafat."

    力促中东和谈的新步骤
    本报记者  陈特安
    英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪昨天破例在外交部会见巴勒斯坦解放组织主席阿拉法特的政治顾问巴沙比·阿比·沙利夫。这一令人颇感“意外”的会晤，引起各方的注意。此间舆论普遍认为，这是英国、巴勒斯坦关系“升格”的象征，表明英国力促中东和谈迈出新的积极的一步。
    英国政府打破了只由次官一级会晤巴勒斯坦解放组织官员的常规，内阁大臣首次出来会见该组织的高级官员，这与当前中东和平进程又走到了一个新的十字路口是密切相关的。举目中东，巴解组织已改变战略，承认以色列生存权利；美巴直接对话的渠道已经开通；西欧与阿以双方频频对话；阿拉伯国家也一致力促中东和谈。然而，7月上旬，沙米尔当局为安抚利库德集团内部的强硬派，单方面修改内阁已经批准的被占领土巴勒斯坦人选举计划，强调在耶路撒冷14万巴勒斯坦人无权参选，重申继续扩建犹太人定居点，起义不平息就不能实施选举，不承认巴解或与之对话。沙米尔当局从原来的立场上大大倒退了，实际上堵塞了中东和谈的大门。
    据《泰晤士报》报道，英国外交部认为，一旦利库德集团右翼加给“沙米尔计划”的条件成为以色列当局的官方政策，那么它“将使和平进程处于更加困难的境地”。正在这样的时刻，豪会晤巴勒斯坦解放组织高级官员，实际上是一种信号，表示英国政府对中东和平进程前景变得黯淡的“严重关切”。
    会晤中，豪告诉沙利夫说，英国政府同意“沙米尔计划”并一直在为这一和平进程工作，利库德集团强加的“条件”是“不可接受”的。他鼓励巴解组织坚持去年11月发表的稳健的政治纲领，并表示英国“将尽力挽救”利库德集团造成的中东和平进程的“倒退”。沙利夫强调，巴解组织将继续坚持对和平进程的承诺，但被占领土上的形势应引起密切关注。他说，巴解并没有完全勾销以色列的计划，但在西岸和加沙地带进行的选举决不能在利库德集团右翼强加的“条件”下进行。
    英国政府此举也无异于向以色列利库德集团右翼敲起警钟、亮出了红灯。据报道，白厅明确表示，英国将继续坚持欧洲共同体马德里首脑会议上达成的一致立场，即巴勒斯坦解放组织应当“加入”中东和平进程；英国还准备呼吁尽快为召开中东问题国际和平会议作准备。英国政府的这一立场同利库德集团右翼的主张显然是不相容的。
    据此间中东问题观察家分析，英、巴间首次部长级的接触以及正在逐步加强的各种形式的会谈“可能将最终导向同阿拉法特的会晤”。
