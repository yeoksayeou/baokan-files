The U.S. Southern Command in the Panama Canal Zone held large-scale military exercises over the past two days in areas adjacent to Panama City, the capital of Panama, threatening the country with military force.

Yesterday, the U.S. military conducted an exercise called "Purple Storm," a surprise vertical warfare drill involving approximately 600 soldiers, 74 tanks, over 100 armed vehicles, and multiple helicopters, fighter jets, and warships. These tanks and military vehicles, loaded with armed soldiers, crossed the Americas Bridge over the canal entrance under air cover and rushed to the Amador Fortress, "evacuating" U.S. military dependents to the Clayton Military Base. Despite the provisions of the canal treaty, the U.S. military also drove tanks to the doorstep of the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters to demonstrate. A group of specially trained armed soldiers lay in ambush near the office of Defense Forces Commander General Noriega, just 20 meters away. Helicopters hovered low over the Defense Forces headquarters.

Today, the U.S. military again deployed tanks and military vehicles to block the main roads connecting Panama City with the Canal Zone. Helicopters transported over 100 Marine Corps personnel to the foothills of Ancon Hill, a symbol of Panamanian national sovereignty, where they landed on the roof of the Gorgas Military Hospital and took control of the surrounding area.

According to a statement from the U.S. Southern Command, these two exercises were intended to test the U.S. military's ability to evacuate dependents and protect hospitals in the event of war. Prior to these exercises, the U.S. military also conducted drills to control key locations such as the cross-isthmus highway from Panama City to Colon, the power system, and the waterworks near Panama City. In reality, these exercises all had clear practical war preparations.

These series of exercises began a month ago after General Mark Sissneros took command of the U.S. Southern Command. This Puerto Rican military officer, who had fought in the Bay of Pigs and Vietnam, has repeatedly stated his intention to use force to pressure Noriega to step down.

The U.S. conducted these military exercises while the Organization of American States sent a delegation of foreign ministers to Panama to promote negotiations aimed at resolving the crisis deepened by the annulment of the May 7 elections. The goal is to use military threats to force the Panamanian military government to make concessions to the U.S.-backed opposition in negotiations and hand over power.

For the U.S. government, this is a critical period for its economic and military strategic interests in the canal and the canal zone. According to the new Panama Canal Treaty signed in 1977, starting from January 1 next year, the co-management of the canal will shift from being primarily U.S.-controlled to being primarily Panamanian-controlled. The head of the canal management committee, currently held by an American, will be held by a Panamanian. Additionally, starting next year, it will be a crucial year for deciding whether to amend the canal treaty to allow the U.S. to retain military bases in the canal zone until the sovereignty of the canal is fully returned to Panama in the year 2000.

The U.S. tightening of pressure and military threats on Panama has not only provoked protests from various sectors in Panama but has also aroused the indignation of the people of Latin America. The Panamanian militia "Dignity Brigade" has twice demonstrated in front of U.S. military bases, and over 1,000 representatives of the "Youth Resistance Front" held a rally, declaring that "Panama will never be a U.S. colony" and vowing to defend its sovereignty to the death.

    美国武力威吓巴拿马
    新华社记者　胡泰然
    美国驻巴拿马运河区的南方司令部昨天和今天连续两天在与巴拿马首都巴拿马城毗连的地区举行大规模军事演习，对这个国家实行武力威胁。
  美军昨天举行的名叫“紫色风暴”演习，是一次突袭式的立体战争演习，投入了约600名士兵、74辆坦克、100多辆驾着机关枪的军车和多架直升机、战斗机和兵舰。这些满载荷枪实弹士兵的坦克和军车，在飞机掩护下驶过横跨运河口的美洲大桥，飞速奔到阿马多尔要塞，把美军眷属“撤退”到克莱顿军事基地。美军不顾运河条约的规定，还把坦克开到巴拿马国防军司令部门前示威。一批经过特种训练的武装士兵埋伏在离国防军司令诺列加将军办公室仅20米的要害地段。直升机呼啸着在国防军总部上面低空盘旋。
    今天，美军又出动坦克和军车封锁了巴拿马首都与运河区相通的交通要道，用直升机把100多名海军陆战队员运送到作为巴拿马民族主权象征的安孔山麓，在戈尔加斯军用医院屋顶突降，并控制了周围地区。
    据美国南方司令部公报宣布，这两次演习是为了实地检验美军在发生战争时紧急撤退眷属和保护医院安全的应变能力。在这之前，美军还举行了控制从巴拿马城到科隆市的跨地峡公路、巴拿马首都附近输电系统和自来水厂等要害部位的军事演习。实际上，这类演习都带有明显的实际备战性质。
    这一系列演习是一个月前马克·西斯内罗斯将军接任美国南方驻军司令后开始的。这个曾在古巴猪湾和越南作过战的波多黎各籍军人，到任后多次表示要用武力逼诺列加辞职。
    美国是在美洲国家组织派出外长代表团到巴拿马促进争端各方谈判，以解决由于宣布5月7日大选作废而加深的危机时，大搞军事演习的，目的是以武力威吓来逼迫巴拿马军政当局在谈判中向美国支持的反对党让步并交出政权。
    对美国政府来说，目前正是关系到它在运河和运河区经济和军事战略利益的关键时期。根据1977年签署的巴拿马运河新条约规定，从明年1月1日起，运河共管权将由现在的以美国为主转为以巴拿马为主，现在由美国人担任的运河管理委员会主任将由巴拿马人担任。同时从明年起将是决定是否修改运河条约，以便允许美国在2000年前夕把运河主权全部交还巴拿马后仍在运河区保持军事基地的重要年头。
    美国对巴拿马加紧施加压力和军事威胁，不仅遭到巴拿马各界的抗议，也激起拉美各国人民的义愤。巴拿马民兵“尊严大队”两次到美军基地前示威抗议，1000多名“青年抵抗阵线”的代表集会，表示“巴拿马绝不充当美国殖民地”，誓死保卫主权。
