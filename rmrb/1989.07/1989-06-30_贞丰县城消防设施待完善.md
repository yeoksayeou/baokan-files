	Our county originally had only 6 fire hydrants, 5 fire-fighting buckets, and 3 fire-fighting ponds. Now, all of these are in name only, with some damaged, some repurposed, and some turned into garbage pits. Additionally, our county has not established a fire brigade, and water sources are scarce. In the event of a fire, the consequences would be severe. We hope that relevant departments will quickly improve the county's public fire protection facilities to ensure the safety of people's lives and property.

    贞丰县城消防设施待完善
    我县原来仅有的6个消火栓、5口消防缸，3个消防池，现都已名存实亡，有的被损坏，有的被挪作他用，有的成了垃圾坑。加上我县没有建立消防队，水源缺乏，一旦发生火灾，后果严重。希望有关部门尽快完善县城的公共消防设施，确保人民生命财产的安全。
