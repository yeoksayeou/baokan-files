After your newspaper published the letter to the editor titled "Be Cautious When Boarding Here" on May 10th on the sixth page, the leadership of our station immediately convened a station affairs meeting. Everyone unanimously agreed that the criticism from the Party newspaper is a manifestation of concern and encouragement for our work.

Through this incident, we will definitely learn from our mistakes, strive to improve our work, further strengthen the education of our staff on the principle of "The People's Railway Serves the People," genuinely improve our service attitude, enhance our service quality, and make Zhengzhou Station a civilized window of socialism.
