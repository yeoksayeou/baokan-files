As early as 1924, Comrade Deng wrote the following lines:

	“With the ‘lamp of practice’ in our hands,
	We will use our bright red blood,
	Drop by drop,
	To paint our path forward,
	The splashes of blood,
	Left for our friends,
	As a ‘lamp of practice’!”

	This “lamp of practice” is Comrade Deng, and it is also the spiritual wealth bequeathed to us by the revolutionary forebears.

	Our Comrade Deng, from the late Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China; from the May Fourth Movement to the founding of New China; from the “Ten Years of Turmoil” to the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, has experienced countless hardships. She transformed from a patriot into a communist warrior. She is a leader of women, a respected elder of the proletarian revolution, and with her selfless pursuit, high moral character, and lifelong dedication, she has erected a monument in the hearts of the people.

	However, Comrade Deng always emphasized, “I am just an ordinary member of the Communist Party.” When we prepared to film a biographical documentary about her, Comrade Deng clearly stated, “Do not film me, go film the workers and peasants on the front lines of production…” Comrade Deng said this, but her strict self-discipline only further ignited my creative passion. I want to film Comrade Deng, and I also want to film other elders of the proletarian revolution. Doing so is not only to leave precious historical materials for future generations but also has significant practical educational value. This is also the responsibility that documentary filmmakers cannot shirk.

	After obtaining approval from the central leadership, I worked by Comrade Deng’s side for over two years. I know that it is impossible to summarize Comrade Deng’s 70 years of hardship in a one-hour documentary. Therefore, I am particularly grateful to Comrade Deng’s staff for their support and assistance, providing us with many clues and invaluable, little-known materials. Of course, I must also thank Comrade Deng for her cooperation:

	When we filmed Comrade Deng recounting her childhood, we deeply felt her longing for her revolutionary mother;
	When she spoke of the May Fourth Movement, we seemed to see the 15-year-old Comrade Deng, as the leader of the speech team, standing at the forefront of the struggle, engaging in a sharp confrontation with the reactionary government;
	When she talked about meeting, falling in love with, and becoming engaged to Zhou Enlai, Comrade Deng’s smiling eyes seemed to sparkle with the flames of youth. Afterwards, Comrade Deng jokingly said, “You have an exclusive scoop.”

	Comrade Deng is a participant in the two united fronts and a survivor of the Nationalist Party’s massacre; under the White Terror, she persisted in underground struggles; on the Long March, she endured severe illness, climbing snow-capped mountains and crossing grasslands, covering a journey of 25,000 li; after liberation, Comrade Deng traveled throughout the country, blending with the people, and the people were always in her heart.

	Every shot we filmed and edited is deeply imbued with our love and respect for Comrade Deng. On the 70th anniversary of the May Fourth Movement, which is also the 70th anniversary of Comrade Deng joining the revolution, we present this film to the audience!

	People often use phrases like “heroic woman” and “female hero” to praise the women they respect, but these words of praise are insufficient to encapsulate Comrade Deng’s admirable experiences and exemplary character. Chairman Li Xiannian named this film “Our Comrade Deng,” and only this simple title can express the people’s feelings for Comrade Deng and accurately convey the film’s theme.

    《我们的邓大姐》拍摄札记
    本片编导、摄影  李则翔
    早在1924年，邓大姐曾写下这样的诗句：
    “掌着‘实践之灯’的我们，
    将用那鲜红的热血，
    一点点，
    一滴滴地渲染在我们前进的路上，
    斑斑的血迹，
    留待送给我们的朋友，
    聊当一盏‘实践之灯’！”
    这一盏“实践之灯”，正是邓大姐，也是革命先辈们给予我们的精神财富。
    我们的邓大姐从清朝末年到民国；从“五·四”运动到新中国诞生；从“十年动乱”到党的十一届三中全会，历尽了沧桑。她从一个爱国主义者成为共产主义战士，她是一代妇女领袖，是我们尊敬的老一辈无产阶级革命家，她以无私的追求、高风亮节和毕生的奉献，在人民心中树立了丰碑。
    可是，邓大姐总是强调说：“我只是一个普通的共产党员”。当我们准备为她拍摄传记纪录片时，邓大姐明确地回答：“不要拍我，去拍在生产斗争第一线的工人同志、农民同志……”邓大姐是这样说了，然而，她那严以律己的思想品德，却更加激发了我的创作欲望。我要拍邓大姐，还要拍其他老一辈无产阶级革命家，这样做，不仅是为子孙后代留下宝贵的革命历史资料，更有其重大的现实教育意义。这也是纪录电影工作者义不容辞的责任。
    当报请中央领导机关同意之后，我在邓大姐身边陆续工作了两年多。我知道，要在一部一个小时的纪录片里概括邓大姐70年的风霜岁月，我是力不从心的。因此，我特别感谢邓大姐身边工作人员对我们的支持和帮助，给我们提供了许多线索和鲜为人知的宝贵资料。当然，更要感谢邓大姐的配合：
    当我们拍摄邓大姐讲述自己童年的时候，使我们深深地感觉到邓大姐对革命母亲的思念之情；
    当讲到“五·四”运动时，我们似乎看到了当年只有15岁的邓大姐，作为演讲队长正站在斗争的前列同反动政府进行针锋相对的斗争；
    当谈到她同周恩来相识、恋爱和定情的时候，在邓大姐欢笑的眼中，好像闪烁着青春的火花。事后邓大姐开玩笑说：“你这可是独家新闻。”
    ……
    邓大姐是两次国共合作的参加者，也是国民党屠刀下的幸存者；在白色恐怖下，她坚持着地下斗争；在长征路上，她身患重病爬雪山过草地，行程二万五千里；解放后，邓大姐走遍祖国各地，她与人民水乳交融，人民，总是在她的心中。
    我们拍摄和编用的每一个镜头，都深含着对大姐的热爱和崇敬的心情。我们在“五·四”运动70周年，也是邓大姐投身革命70周年之际，把这部影片献给观众！
    人们常用“巾帼英雄”、“女中豪杰”来赞誉心目中尊敬的女性，然而，这些赞美的词句却难以概括邓大姐令人感佩的经历和堪称表率的品德。李先念主席为本片题名《我们的邓大姐》，也只有“我们的邓大姐”这简朴的称呼，才表达了人民对大姐的感情，准确地展现了影片的主题。
