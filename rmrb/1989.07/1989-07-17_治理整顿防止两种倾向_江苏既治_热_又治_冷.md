Jiangsu Addresses Both Overheating and Sluggishness in Economic Adjustment

According to recent statistics from the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Statistics, the overheating phenomenon in industrial production in this province is easing; meanwhile, some industries that had seen slow growth in previous years, affecting the overall stable development of the economy, are beginning to show signs of recovery.

Jiangsu's industrial production, which had been growing at an annual rate of around 20% in previous years, grew by only 9.9% in the first half of this year. The number of state-owned enterprise construction and new start-up projects in the province decreased by 1,419 compared to the same period last year, and the completion amount of state-owned fixed asset investment was reduced by 20% compared to the same period last year.

At the same time, various levels of government in Jiangsu Province have begun to increase their investment in agricultural production and agricultural-related industries. The supply of daily necessities such as salt, sugar, soap, detergent, cotton cloth, and matches is abundant, the market is stable, and urban and rural residents' savings have increased significantly.

In the process of rectification and adjustment, the various levels of government in Jiangsu Province have, on the one hand, resolutely curbed the overheated economic growth rate and demand, and on the other hand, focused their efforts on addressing the sluggishness, promoting the production of agriculture, raw materials, energy industries, and daily necessities.

The various levels of government and financial departments in Jiangsu have also, through classification and prioritization of existing industrial enterprises and products, given preferential treatment in terms of funding, energy, and raw material supply to agricultural materials, essential daily necessities, high-quality durable consumer goods that recycle currency, and export products that earn foreign exchange. This preferential policy has promoted the adjustment of product structure.

    治理整顿防止两种倾向
    江苏既治“热”又治“冷”
    据新华社南京7月17日电　（记者费强）江苏省统计局最近提供的《统计分析资料》表明：这个省工业生产过热的现象正在缓解；而前几年增长缓慢、影响经济全面稳定发展的一些产业则开始升温。
    前几年一直以20％左右的幅度增长的江苏工业生产，今年上半年只增长了9.9％，全省全民所有制企业在建和新开工项目比去年减少1419个，全民固定资产投资完成额比去年同期压缩了20％。
    与此同时，江苏省各级政府对农业生产和农用工业的投入开始增加；食盐、食糖、肥皂、洗衣粉、棉布、火柴等日用工业品货源充足，市场稳定，城乡居民储蓄大幅度增加。
    在治理整顿中，江苏省各级政府一方面下决心把过热的经济增长速度和需求降下来，另一方面集中力量“治冷”，把农业、原材料和能源工业以及日用工业品的生产促上去。
    江苏各级政府和金融部门，还通过对现有工业企业和产品实行分类排队，在资金、能源和原材料供应上，对农用物资、人民生活必需品、回笼货币多的优质耐用消费品以及出口创汇产品实行重点倾斜。倾斜政策促进了产品结构的调整。
