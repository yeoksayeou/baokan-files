Over the past few years, various regions have been vying to produce popular products. There has been a boom in cars, refrigerators, and color televisions, with one hot trend following another. Now, there is a surge in the demand for color picture tubes and VCRs.

When everyone rushes in to start similar projects, it inevitably leads to repeated introductions and redundant constructions, wasting productive forces. This not only reduces macroeconomic benefits but also microeconomic benefits. These harms are well-known. The state has repeatedly stressed that projects should not be started haphazardly and has emphasized the importance of considering the overall situation and planning locations. However, many places still persist in their enthusiasm and proceed with the projects regardless.

Criticizing them for lacking a sense of the bigger picture and for acting independently is justified. However, the problem is not that simple. Some places are eager to produce popular products due to deep-seated economic reasons. Local governments have their own economic interests, and the fiscal decentralization system has greatly strengthened these local economic interests. Popular products are often high-priced and high-profit items. Having them means having fiscal revenue, making the local government's work much easier, and also increasing employment and market supply. How can local governments not do everything possible to start these projects? Simply asking local governments to consider the overall situation is not enough, and relying solely on administrative measures to control the situation is also not enough. Economic issues ultimately need to be resolved through economic means.

Macroeconomic regulation must be based on the law of value and coordinate local economic interests. The planning and location of popular products must be scientific and fair, determined by the market demand and the scale of development. There must be strict scientific arguments and extensive discussions. Specifically, how to determine the location and who gets to start the project should be decided through fair competition and transparency, not just by who wants to start it. Those who violate industrial policies and start projects arbitrarily should be punished both administratively and economically, and they should not be allowed to benefit from it.

With a scientific and fair planning and location, it is necessary to strictly implement it. Although it has been repeatedly emphasized that projects should not be started arbitrarily, many times there has been no strict control. Those who have started the projects have benefited, while those who have not started have suffered a loss. In this way, the more it is emphasized, the more people rush to start projects. If this continues, no matter how many times it is emphasized, it will not be effective. Industrial policies must be backed by organizational discipline and administrative measures.

    为何热劲难减？
    皮子
    这几年，各地争上热门产品。汽车热、冰箱热、彩电热，热浪一个接着一个。如今，又来了彩管热，录相机热。
    一哄而起，乱上项目，难免重复引进，重复建设，浪费生产力，既降低宏观经济效益，又降低微观经济效益。这些危害，恐怕没有人不知道。国家三令五申不准乱上项目，强调顾全大局，规划布点，可是不少地方仍是热劲难减，照上不误。
    批评他们缺乏全局观念，批评他们各行其是，都应该。可问题又不那么简单。一些地方争上热门产品有其深厚的经济根源。地方有地方的经济利益，财政分灶的体制又大大强化了地方的经济利益。热门产品多是价高利大的产品，有了它，就有了财政收入，地方的日子就要好过得多，而且还有增加就业，增加市场供应等诸多好处，地方怎能不千方百计上项目？只是要求地方顾全大局不行，仅用行政手段控制也不行，经济问题最终还是要靠经济手段去解决。
    宏观调控必须建立在价值规律基础上，协调好地方的经济利益。热门产品的规划布点必须是科学的、公正的，根据市场需求量多少，发展规模大小，确定项目布点。要有严格的科学论证，多方协商探讨。具体如何定点，谁上谁不上，应该公平竞争，公开公正，不能谁想上就上。对违反产业政策乱上项目的，在行政上、经济上都要处罚，不能让他们占便宜。
    有了科学的、公正的规划布点，还要切实贯彻执行。不准乱上项目，虽是三令五申，可许多时候并没有严格控制，上了的也就上了，没上的反倒吃了亏，这样一来，你越是三令五申，人家越是抢着上。长此下去，就是再多的三令五申，也是禁不住的。产业政策必须有组织纪律和行政手段作为保证。
