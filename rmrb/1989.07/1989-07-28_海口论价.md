Prices in Haikou

The capital of Hainan Province, Haikou, is known for its beautiful scenery and pleasant climate, attracting people from all over the country and abroad. However, as soon as they arrive, they are immediately caught up in the web of high prices: everything from food to clothing, daily necessities to transportation is affected.

First, let's talk about food. In the agricultural markets, a kilogram of fresh pork costs 14 to 15 yuan, and a kilogram of green vegetables costs 1.5 to 1.6 yuan. Some restaurants charge 16 to 17 yuan for a bowl of stir-fried noodles, which is unbearable for ordinary people.

Clothing prices are also exorbitant: a pair of men's trousers, with nothing special about them, costs 170 yuan; a regular shirt costs 120 yuan; a belt costs 150 yuan. The high prices are justified by the so-called "brand names." But most of these "brand names" are counterfeit.

Haikou has few public bus routes, so taxis have become an important means of transportation for people. Almost all taxis have signs of overcharging, and this is even more serious at night. At places like the airport and docks, taxi drivers often significantly raise their prices. A trip from the airport to the city center, which is only 3 to 4 kilometers, costs at least 10 yuan, and sometimes as much as 15 yuan, several times the regulated price. If passengers have any objections, they are often met with a retort: "If you can't afford a taxi, walk!"

Strolling through the streets of Haikou, one often sees people with pens and notebooks, wandering from store to store, checking prices of goods, and then moving on to another store to do the same. It turns out that in the Haikou market, from small items like toothpaste and soap to large items like cameras, TVs, and VCRs, the prices of the same goods are not uniform, with price differences ranging from a few cents to a few hundred yuan. Those who know this secret always check the prices around before making a purchase, while many tourists and business travelers are unwittingly cheated out of their money. Some stores and stalls even openly keep the change that should be returned to customers, using the excuse of "no change to give."

In the first half of this year, Hainan's price index rose by 39.8%, far exceeding the national average. This is certainly influenced by factors such as the increase in the number of outsiders, but the lack of control over prices is also a major reason. High prices not only make it difficult for long-term residents to live here, but also directly affect the image of the Hainan Special Economic Zone, as well as its development and construction.

### 海口论价

    海口论价
    海南省会海口，风光绮丽、景色怡人，吸引了海内外各界人士。但人们一临此地，便马上被卷入物价的缠绕之中：吃穿用行，无一能免。
    先说吃的。农贸市场上，一公斤鲜瘦猪肉要十四五元钱，一公斤青菜要一块五六毛钱。有的餐馆一碗炒面就收十六七元钱，让常人难以忍受。
    穿的衣服，价格也很邪乎：一件男式长裤，并无什么特殊之处，竟要价170元；一件普通衬衣要120元；一条腰带要150元。价格高就高在所谓“名牌”上。但“名牌”大多假冒。
    海口公共汽车线路较少，出租车自然成了人们代步的重要工具。而几乎所有的出租车都有超标准收费的迹象，在晚上就更严重。在飞机场、码头等处，出租车司机往往大涨其价。从机场到市区，三四公里远，收费少则10元，多则15元，高出规定价格数倍。乘客稍有异议，往往还被抢白一句：坐不起小车走路去！
    漫步海口街头，常常可看到有人拿着笔和小本子，在商店里转转悠悠看商品，记价格，然后到另一个商店再看、再记。原来，海口市场上的商品，小到牙膏、香皂，大到照相机、彩电、录像机等，同样商品都没有统一价格，差价从几分钱到一二百元不等。知道这个奥秘的人，买东西前总是先四处看看行情，然后掏钱购买，而许多游客、出差公干的，在不知不觉中就被骗了钱去。有些商店、摊点，还常以“没有零钱找”为由，公然将理应找还给顾客的零钱攫为己有。
    今年上半年，海南物价指数上升达39.8％，大大超过全国水平。这其中，当然有外来人口增多等因素的影响，但对物价的管理失控恐怕也是一大原因。物价太高，不仅久居这里的人吃不消，而且直接影响到海南大特区的形象，还影响到它的发展和建设。
