	Shangyu County in Zhejiang Province recently conducted an inspection of the agricultural resource (agricultural inputs) monopoly operations across the county. The results showed that the first batch of ammonium carbonate (carbonate fertilizer) used for spring crops had no "favoritism fertilizer" and no "backdoor tickets." Farmers commented that the monopoly operations were genuinely strict.

	A widespread agricultural resource supervision network has become the guarantee system for maintaining the order of agricultural resource monopoly operations in Shangyu County. 1,000 copies of notices detailing the "four public, eight prohibitions, and one supervision" system for agricultural resource monopoly operations were posted throughout the 800 administrative villages in the county. After the monopoly operations began, the distribution plans for each batch of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films were posted in the most prominent locations in the towns and villages. 13 supervision hotlines and 57 suggestion boxes set up across the county are always available to receive public supervision and reports. During the agricultural resource supply process, various "consultation cards" promptly feedback the opinions, voices, and demands of the farmers.

	The agricultural resource monopoly supervision and coordination groups, led by the county, district, and township (town) governments, and involving the supply and marketing, commerce, agricultural technology departments, and farmer representatives, have become the core of the county's supervision network. They are responsible for determining the distribution and supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural films across the county, coordinating relevant policies, and inspecting the implementation of these policies. The county supply and marketing cooperative established a monopoly supervision leading group to oversee the internal supervision of the agricultural resource operating departments in the entire system. By integrating efforts from top to bottom and inside out, a multi-level, multi-faceted group supervision system has been formed. If any problems arise, they can be discovered and resolved within three days.

	Shangyu County has also taken steps in ideological education and material guarantees to create a good environment for agricultural resource monopoly operations. The county's top leaders, along with relevant department personnel, visited more than 10 townships (towns) to communicate with farmers, explaining the distribution and supply methods and increasing transparency.

	In response to the new situations and problems that arose after the agricultural resource monopoly operations, the county supply and marketing cooperative held six training sessions. These sessions provided training on monopoly policies, discipline, agricultural technology knowledge, and business skills for the relevant personnel involved in agricultural resource monopoly operations.

    上下内外结合　群众广泛监督
    上虞县农资监督网过硬
    本报讯　浙江省上虞县最近对全县农资专营情况的检查表明：全县第一期用于春季作物的碳铵，无一斤“人情”肥，无一张“后门”条子。农民反映，专营真的硬碰硬了。
    遍布城乡的农资监督网络，已成为上虞县维护农资专营秩序的保证体系。1000份印有农资专营“四公开、八不准、一监督”制度的通告，贴遍全县800个行政村。专营后，每一批化肥、农药、农膜的分配方案，都被张贴在乡村最醒目的地方。分设在全县各地的13只监督电话，57只意见箱，随时接受群众的监督举报。农资供应过程中，各类“征询卡”及时反馈农民群众的意见、呼声和要求。
    由县、区、乡（镇）政府牵头，供销、工商、农技等部门和农民代表参加的农资专营监督协调小组，成为全县监督网络的中心。他们负责确定全县化肥、农药、农膜的分配供应，协调有关政策，检查落实情况。县供销社成立专营监督领导小组，负责全系统农资经营部门的内部监督。上下结合、内外结合，形成了多层次、多方位的群体监督，一旦出现问题，就能在3天内发现并解决。
    上虞县还从思想教育和物质保证两方面入手，为农资专营创造良好的环境。县主要领导会同有关部门人员分别到10多个乡（镇）与农民对话，讲清分配、供应办法，增加透明度。
    针对农资专营后出现的新情况、新问题，县供销社先后举办了6期培训班，对从事农资专营的有关人员进行专营政策、纪律教育、农技知识和业务技能等方面的培训。
