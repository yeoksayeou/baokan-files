On a hot summer morning, in Hebei Province's Weiji County, at the Haozhuang Grain Station, a crowd of over 100 people gathered, including many county leaders from various departments. The center of attention, however, was a farmer in his fifties. He cut a half steamed bun into pieces the size of soybeans, mixed it with his self-developed "Qiu's Mouse Lure" and rat poison, sprayed it with a bit of alcohol, sprinkled some flour, and then mixed it with water. After inspecting over 20 rat holes in the toilets and pigpens, he told the crowd, "These are all 'small rats,' there are no big ones." As he spoke, he scattered the poisoned bait around each rat hole. A staff member from the County Committee Office wanted to test whether the rats preferred his bait or the snacks, so he broke up a newly bought cake and placed it near the rat holes. Qiu Man Dun laughed and said to the onlookers, "Just wait! The rats will eat the bait within 15 minutes and will die outside the holes within two hours!" Everyone simultaneously checked their watches: 10:05 AM.

After 15 minutes, the reporter checked each hole and found that the poisoned bait had been eaten by the rats, while the cake remained untouched.

An hour and a half later, in the courtyard of the grain station, people were astonished to see a few rats boldly emerging from their holes. Everyone gathered around the holes and saw rats peeking out. Under the cameras and the gaze of the crowd, the rats were surprisingly fearless. Some crawled out of the holes and ran around erratically; some even ran onto people's feet, startling the timid. The bait scatterer reassured, "Don't be afraid, they won't bite people anymore." He then picked up a rat that was running wildly and touched its mouth with his finger. The rat's mouth was stuck shut as if by glue. One by one, the usually secretive rats acted like they were mentally ill, running wildly before collapsing, staggering, and eventually dying. In just over half an hour, 21 rats died in front of the crowd, just as the bait scatterer had predicted: all were "small rats."

The onlookers were amazed and exclaimed in wonder.

He is known as the "Rat King" Qiu Man Dun, 55 years old, with a 30-year history of studying rats.

Qiu Man Dun is an ordinary farmer from Chen Village in Weiji County. In his early years, due to poverty, he only attended school for two months.

In 1957, he returned from the army and coincided with the "Eradicate Four Pests" campaign. Rats were the first among the four pests, and everyone hated them. He personally witnessed cunning rats hiding in their holes, causing villagers to use smoke, water, and even digging to try to catch them, all in vain. Qiu Man Dun thought, "If a medicine could be made to lure rats out of their holes and make them willingly eat it, that would be great." From then on, Qiu Man Dun delved into the "rat kingdom." He caught rats and raised them, continuing for 11 years, thus uncovering an interesting and mysterious world.

He experimented with agricultural chemicals 3911 and Antu, but the rats wouldn't even sniff them.

He then placed various flavors—sour, sweet, bitter, spicy—of food in cages to see what the rats liked. After multiple observations, he discovered that rats loved the tips of corn. He dug up over a dozen rat holes in the fields and found piles of corn with the tips bitten off. Why? It turned out that the tips of corn were the embryos, containing starch, fat, and protein.

He got up every midnight to observe the rats carefully by the cages. Pigpens, livestock sheds, and every nook and cranny were his observation spots. Through scorching summers and freezing winters, he never stopped.

He observed how rats dug holes and made nests, how they ate, drank, excreted, and slept.

He dissected countless pregnant rats, understanding that each female rat gave birth to 8 litters a year, with each litter having at least 5 and up to 16 offspring. The baby rats started mating in their third month...

He also found that whatever rats liked to eat, ants also liked. Based on this, ants replaced rats as his "test subjects."

Through experiments, Qiu Man Dun discovered that using a drug to poison a rat in one place would rarely have another rat fall into the same trap.

For 28 years, through over 4,000 nights of hard work, 4,500 experiments, 3,000 food selections and combinations, in 1981, Qiu Man Dun finally developed "Qiu's Mouse Lure." This lure can be combined with any rat poison, maximizing its effectiveness. No matter what kind of rat poison, if mixed with "Qiu's Mouse Lure" and hung on a wall or placed on the ground, rats would eat it without hesitation.

Qiu Man Dun succeeded.

In 1983, Qiu Man Dun traveled from Hebei, Shandong to Shaanxi, developing and selling his "Mouse Lure" along the way.

One winter day, Qiu Man Dun arrived at Guanchi Town in Dali County, Shaanxi Province. In the town government office, he performed a rat eradication demonstration, killing 19 rats on the spot. Under the initiative of the town party secretary, the entire town launched a rat eradication campaign. Qiu Man Dun distributed poison bait and provided on-site guidance in each village. In 11 days, over 100,000 rats were killed. In just one place, Xiyang Village, 1.7 million rats were killed, filling 7 carts.

Over the years, he has performed over 700 rat eradication demonstrations, killing over 10 million rats.

Qiu Man Dun and his mouse lure attracted attention from all sectors of society. Xinhua News Agency reported his rat eradication skills domestically and internationally, causing a sensation both at home and abroad. Nearly 30 countries wrote requesting his technology and formula. An American businessman offered 2.7 million US dollars to hire him to go to America. Faced with the generous offer, Qiu Man Dun's response was: "The rat problem in China is severe. I am Chinese and want to serve the Chinese people."

For developing the rat poison, Qiu Man Dun paid a great price. He sold three rooms in his house, and his wife, disapproving of his pursuits, divorced him.

Fortunately, the science and technology commissions at the provincial, municipal, and county levels paid great attention to his invention and organized experts to appraise his research results. The leaders of the Hebei Provincial Committee and Provincial Government also attached great importance to this research achievement, forming a leading group consisting of leaders from the Provincial Science and Technology Commission, Health and Hygiene Committee, Agricultural Research Institute, Grain Bureau, Shijiazhuang Region, and Weiji County. They decided to establish the "Qiu's Mouse Lure" Research Center and a rat poison factory. Currently, this achievement has applied for a national patent.

    邱满囤和“诱鼠剂”
    新华社记者  郭素芝
                      （一）
    盛夏的一天上午，河北省无极县郝庄粮站。
    熙熙攘攘的100多人围成了圈圈，其中有不少是县里各部门的领导。可中心人物却是个50开外的庄稼汉。只见他把一个半馒头切成黄豆粒大小的碎块，拌上他研制的“邱氏诱鼠剂”和鼠药，又喷上一口酒，撒上些面粉，然后用水拌匀。在查看了厕所、猪圈等处的20多个老鼠洞后，他对人们说：“这里都是‘小老’，没有大的。”边说边把拌好的鼠药撒在一个个老鼠洞口。县委办公室的一个同志想试探一下老鼠是爱吃他的药，还是爱吃点心，就把刚买来的蛋糕掰碎，也放在老鼠洞口。邱满囤乐呵呵地对参观的人说：“等着吧！15分钟内老鼠准吃药，两个钟头就会跑出洞口死掉！”大家不约而同看了一下手表：10点05分。
    过了15分钟，记者到每个洞口逐一查看，果然，毒饵已被老鼠吃光，而蛋糕却一点儿没动。
    一个半小时以后，在粮站院内，人们惊奇地发现，有几只老鼠大摇大摆地从洞里出来了。大家围到各个洞口一看，都有老鼠在探头探脑。在摄影机镜头和众目睽睽之下，它们竟毫不胆怯，有的钻出洞，神经质地乱撞乱窜；有的窜到人们的脚面上，把胆小的人吓一跳。施药人却说：“别怕，它绝不会咬人了。”说着，抓起一只正在乱窜的老鼠，用手指摸它的嘴巴，老鼠的嘴竟像被胶水粘住一般。那一只只平时行动诡秘的老鼠，都像得了精神病，狂跑一阵儿之后，东倒西歪，步履蹒跚，不一会儿就死了。仅半个多钟头，就有21只老鼠死在人们面前，而且正像施药人所说：全是“小老”。
    围观者大哗，纷纷称奇。
                              （二）
    他，就是被人称为“灭鼠大王”的邱满囤，今年55岁，有30年研究老鼠的历史了。
    邱满囤是无极县陈村的一个普通农民。早时因家境贫寒，只读过两个月小学。
    1957年，他从部队复员，正赶上“除四害”。老鼠是“四害”之首，人人痛恨。他亲眼见到刁钻的老鼠躲进洞中，害得乡亲们用烟熏、水灌，直至挖洞，仍然不能捉住。邱满囤心想：如果能制出一种药，引诱老鼠出洞，使它乐意吞服，那该多好。从此，邱满囤一头扎进了“老鼠王国”。他把老鼠抓来饲养，一养就是11年，从而揭开了一个有趣的神秘世界。
    他用农药3911乐果、安托做试验，老鼠闻都不闻。
    他又将酸、甜、苦、辣各种味道的食物放在笼子里，看老鼠爱吃什么。经多次观察，他发现老鼠爱吃玉米嘴。他到地里扒开十几个鼠洞，看到成堆的玉米都被咬掉了嘴。这是为什么？原来玉米嘴就是玉米的胚芽，含有淀粉、脂肪和蛋白质。
    他天天半夜起来，蹲在笼子边仔细观察。猪圈、牲口棚、旮旮旯旯，都是他观察老鼠的好场所，酷暑严寒，他从不间断。
    他看到了，老鼠怎样挖洞做窝，怎样吃喝拉撒睡。
    他解剖过无数只怀孕的母鼠，摸清了全年每只母鼠产仔8窝，每窝最少5只，最多16只，仔鼠生下来第三个月就交配……
    他还发现，凡老鼠爱吃的，蚂蚁也爱吃。凭这一点，蚂蚁代替老鼠，成了他的“试验品”。
    通过实验，邱满囤发现，用一种药物在一个地方毒死了一只老鼠，便极少再有老鼠重蹈覆辙。
    28个春夏秋冬，4000多个辛劳之夜，4500多次试验，3000多次食品选配和排列组合，1981年，邱满囤终于研制出了“邱氏诱鼠剂”。这种诱鼠剂可以和一切灭鼠药相配，使其发挥最大的灭鼠效力。无论哪种灭鼠药，只要加入“邱氏诱鼠剂”，把它挂到墙上或放到地上，老鼠都会不顾一切地去吃。
    邱满囤成功了。
                    （三）
    1983年，邱满囤从河北、山东到陕西，一路研制，一路叫卖这种“诱鼠剂”。
    冬季的一天，邱满囤来到陕西省大荔县官池镇。在镇政府机关，他为人们作了灭鼠表演，当场灭鼠19只。在镇党委书记的倡导下，全镇开展了一次灭鼠活动。邱满囤逐村发放毒饵，现场指导，用了11天时间，总共灭鼠10多万只，仅西阳村一处，死老鼠就拉了7架子车，共1.7万多只。
    几年来，他已做过700多次灭鼠表演，灭鼠1000多万只。
    邱满囤和他的诱鼠剂引起了社会各界的关注。新华社向国内外报道了他的灭鼠绝技，不仅在国内引起震动，而且饮誉海外。有近30个国家来信要求买他的技术和配方。美国商人提出用270万美金聘请他到美国去。面对重金聘请，邱满囤的回答是：“中国鼠害很严重，我是中国人，要为中国人民服务。”
    为研制鼠药，邱满囤付出了极大的代价。家里的三间房被他卖掉了，妻子嫌他不务正业，同他离了婚。
    值得庆幸的是，河北省、地、县三级科委对他的发明十分重视，对他的研究成果组织专家进行了鉴定。河北省委、省政府领导对这项研究成果也十分重视，组成了由省科委、爱卫会、农业所、粮食局、石家庄地区、无极县有关领导参加的领导小组，并决定成立“邱氏诱鼠剂”研究中心和鼠药厂；目前这项成果已申请国家专利。　（新华社供本报专稿）
