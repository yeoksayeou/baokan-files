Due to work requirements, I often conduct investigations in rural areas. I have found that, apart from those who go out to hide and give birth, there are many new "tricks" used by those who exceed birth quotas:

	Transferring household registration to exceed birth quotas. After a couple has one child, if the husband or wife's original household registration is in a place that allows two children, they will transfer the wife's household registration to the husband's or wife's family and hang it there, claiming to "legitimately have a second child."

	"Carrying household registration in a bag" to exceed birth quotas. After a couple has one child, they use transferring household registration as an excuse, take down the household registration, and carry it in a bag. This way, neither side has a household registration, and both sides do not manage it, allowing them to exceed birth quotas without worry.

	Exceeding birth quotas without planning and then planning to give birth. Young men and women who have been away for a long time have an out-of-wedlock child, temporarily entrust someone to raise the child, return home, and then go through the marriage procedures and formally obtain a birth permit, claiming to "reasonably and legally have one child."

	"Borrowing a corpse to return to life" to exceed birth quotas. They pay money to find a suitable person to undergo a sterilization operation as a cover-up, and then give birth at home. In our county's Hekou Township, there is a woman who underwent an induced abortion in January and had an IUD inserted in April, with all the procedures in place, making people feel at ease. However, in May, she gave birth to a child.

	Widowed women exceeding birth quotas. In Yongxing Township, there is a woman with two children. After her husband died, she went out and lived with a man who had no children or a bachelor and gave birth to one child; then she lived with another person and gave birth to another child. The man's place of residence sympathizes, and the woman's place of residence does not know.

	The above several "tricks" should be noted by the broad masses of cadres and the people. The government and the family planning department should study them well and take corresponding countermeasures and control measures.

    注意花样繁多的超生
    因工作需要，我经常到农村调查，发现无计划生育者除外出躲着生育外，又耍出了许多新的“高招”：
    转户口超生。夫妇有一个孩子后，若是夫或妇的老家属照顾二孩地区时，就把女方户口迁到婆家或娘家挂起，美其名曰“正大光明地生二胎”。
    “包包户口”超生。夫妇有一个孩子后，就以迁户口为理由，把户口下了放在包包里，两头没有户口，两头都管不着而放心地超生。
    无计划超生后又有计划地生。男女青年长期外出，有了非婚生孩子后，把孩子暂托人养起，回家来，才去办结婚手续，正式领取生育证，美其名曰“合理合法地生一个”。
    “借尸还魂”超生。拿钱找适当的人顶替做节育手术，掩人耳目，自己在家里稳起生。我县河口乡有一个妇女元月引产、四月安环，手续齐备，令人放心，结果五月里生了孩子。
    丧夫妻子超生。永兴乡有一个妇女有两个孩子，男人死后，又外出与没有孩子的男人或单身汉同居生一个；又与另一人同居生一个。对此，男方所在地同情，女方所在地不知。
    以上几个“高招”，应引起广大干部群众的注意，政府和计划生育部门应当很好研究，采取相应的对策和控制措施。
