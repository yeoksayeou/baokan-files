Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 14th July.

The textile industry has initially reversed its downward trend and is now steadily growing. Wu Wenying, Minister of the Textile Industry, recently called on textile industry cadres and workers to overcome difficulties and do everything possible to complete this year's national plan.

Wu Wenying reported that from January to June this year, the total industrial output value of the national textile industry was 65.89 billion yuan, an increase of 4.4% over the same period last year. However, there are imbalances in production development among regions and enterprises, and economic benefits have declined.

Given that raw materials, funds, and energy are unlikely to improve in the short term, it is expected that the textile production situation in the second half of the year will remain severe.

    纺织业滑坡初步扭转  下半年形势仍很严峻
    本报讯　新华社记者李安定、本报记者莫新元报道：全国纺织工业已扭转了年初的滑坡，开始稳步增长。纺织工业部部长吴文英日前要求纺织行业干部职工克服困难，千方百计地完成今年的国家计划。
    吴文英介绍，今年1—6月，全国纺织工业完成工业总产值658.9亿美元，比去年同期增长4.4％。但是，地区之间、企业之间生产发展不平衡，经济效益下降。
    鉴于原料、资金、能源不可能在短期内有改善，预计下半年纺织生产形势仍很严峻。
