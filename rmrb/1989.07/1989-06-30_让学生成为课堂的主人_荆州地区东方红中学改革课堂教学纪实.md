	Let Students Become the Masters of the Classroom
	—A Record of Classroom Teaching Reform at Dongfanghong Middle School in Jingzhou Region

	The teacher lectures, and the students listen. This seems to be the natural order of things. This teaching method often leaves students drowsy and with little to gain. Zhang Lenzhe, a language arts teacher at Dongfanghong Middle School in Jingzhou Region, Hubei Province, has explored the "Four-Self Teaching Method" in language arts instruction. Under the teacher's guidance, students analyze, summarize, create questions, and evaluate themselves. The students he has taught have outperformed those from key schools.

	Writing classes are often the most challenging for students. When there is nothing to say, they resort to fabricating stories, filling their papers with empty, grandiose, and clichéd phrases. The language arts teachers at the school designed the "Three-Wonder Press Conference" (news, interesting stories, and oddities exchange), held once a week. Gradually, the students' minds are filled with material, and they no longer worry about having nothing to say. Previously, articles about people were limited to "My Desk Mate," "My Teacher," "My Father," and became clichéd. Now, students go out and become little reporters. Su Min's article, "A New Era's Lei Feng – Interview with Liu Guangxiu, an Excellent Service Worker at Jingzhou Hotel," won the national middle school student practical writing contest held by "Middle School Student Writing" magazine.

	When it comes to chemistry classes, people often think of memorizing molecular formulas and the dull periodic elements, making it intimidating. Liu Guangyou's first introductory lesson made students fall in love with chemistry. Before the class, he used phenolphthalein solution to write "Wishing you success in the new school year" on a large white paper, which he then dried. In class, he passed the paper around for students to confirm it was just a blank sheet, then hung it on the blackboard and sprayed it with a dilute solution containing NaOH. Instantly, the red characters appeared on the white paper. Seeing the teacher's warm wishes, the students were amazed and curious, turning their curiosity into exploration. The junior high chemistry class thus began with a spirit of inquiry.

	Regarding English, there was once the saying, "I am Chinese, why learn a foreign language?" Xu Chaoping and other teachers took first-year students to meet friends from California, USA. When the American friends kindly asked three female students questions in English, they were embarrassed because they couldn't understand or respond. Back in the classroom, the teachers adapted the text into short stories, and the students acted out different roles. The classroom seemed to have entered another world, and no one was troubled by not being able to memorize vocabulary anymore.

    让学生成为课堂的主人
    ——荆州地区东方红中学改革课堂教学纪实
    张妙斌
    老师讲、学生听，这似乎天经地义。这种教授程式经常使学生昏昏欲睡、所获无几。湖北省荆州地区东方红中学曾伦哲老师在语文教学中探索出“单元教学四自法”。学生在老师的引导下，自己分析、自己总结、自己命题、自己评分，经他带出来的学生的成绩超过了重点中学。
    作文课，学生最头疼。无话可说的时候，只有胡编乱造，满本空话、大话、套话。该校语文老师们设计出“三闻发布会”（新闻、趣闻、奇闻交流），一周一次，学生们的头脑渐渐充满了素材，再不为无话可说而发愁了。记人的文章，过去局限于“我的同座”、“我的老师”、“我的爸爸”，写俗了。现在走出去，当一名小小的记者。苏敏同学《新时代的雷锋——访荆州饭店优秀服务员刘光秀》获《中学生作文》杂志举办的全国中学生实用文征文优胜奖。
    提起化学课，就让人想到死记硬背的分子式、枯燥无味的周期元素，使人望而生畏。刘关游老师在上第一节导言课时，就使同学们爱上了化学。他事先用酚酞试液在一张大白纸上写上“祝同学们在新学年里取得好成绩”，晾干，在课堂上交给同学们传看，确认只是一张白纸，然后挂在黑板上，用含有NaOH的稀溶液喷射，顿时，白纸上显现出醒目的红色大字。看到白纸上老师的亲切祝愿，同学们惊奇不已，由惊奇转而探究，初三的化学课便在探究的心态下开始了。
    对于英语，这里曾经也出现过“我是中国人，何必学外文”的说法。徐朝平等老师带着初一学生去会见来自美国加利福尼亚州的朋友，当美国朋友亲切地用英语询问三位女同学时，她们都因听不懂、说不出，脸上现出万分的难堪。回到教室，老师们把课文改编成一个一个的小故事，同学们扮演一个一个的角色。一间教室，仿佛进入另一个国度，再没有人为背不出单词而苦恼了。
