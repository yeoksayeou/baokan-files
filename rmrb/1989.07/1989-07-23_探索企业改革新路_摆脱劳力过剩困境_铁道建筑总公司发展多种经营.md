China Railway Construction Corporation (formerly the Engineering Command of the Ministry of Railways) has actively developed diversified operations and adjusted its industrial structure. In the process of reforming construction enterprises, it has explored ways to place surplus employees and family members, thereby overcoming the difficulties caused by the compression of construction investment and achieving remarkable results.

The predecessor of this company was the Railway Engineering Corps of the People's Liberation Army. After the collective demobilization and conversion to civilian work in 1984, the company faced two major challenges: first, the state's compression of construction investment led to a significant reduction in construction tasks and a sharp increase in surplus personnel; second, a large number of family members and children followed the workforce, causing employment difficulties. To ease the contradictions and stabilize the workforce, the corporation has taken placing surplus labor and family members as a strategic task for deepening enterprise reform. By the end of 1988, the entire system had established 782 diversified operation enterprises and workpoints, arranging employment for 15,538 people, accounting for 10% of the total workforce. Their main approach was to make do with what was available, utilizing idle rooms, sites, and simple equipment to start service, repair, processing, planting, and breeding projects, achieving the effects of low investment, short cycles, and quick results. More than 90% of the enterprise workpoints in the system achieved the goal of investment in the current year and benefits in the current year. Currently, diversified operations cover 19 industries, producing more than 1,000 products, with 27 products entering the international market.

    探索企业改革新路  摆脱劳力过剩困境
    铁道建筑总公司发展多种经营
    本报讯　中国铁道建筑总公司（原铁道部工程指挥部）积极发展多种经营，调整产业结构，在施工企业改革中探索出安置富余人员和家属子女就业的路子，从而摆脱了因基建投资压缩造成的困境，取得显著效益。
    这个公司的前身是人民解放军铁道兵部队，1984年集体转业改工后，面临两个严峻问题的挑战：一是国家基建投资压缩，施工任务缺口大，队伍富余人员急剧增加；二是大批家属子女随迁随调，就业困难。为了缓解矛盾，稳定队伍，总公司把安排富余劳力和家属子女就业作为深化企业改革的战略任务来抓。截至1988年底，全系统共办了多种经营企业网点782个，安排就业15538人，占队伍总数的10％。他们的主要做法是因陋就简，广泛利用空闲房屋、场地、简易设备，办起服务、修理、加工、种植和养殖等项目，收到投资少、周期短、见效快的效果。全系统90％以上的企业网点达到当年投资、当年见效的目的。目前，多种经营涉及19个行业，能生产1000多种产品，有27种产品进入国际市场。　（陈世珍）
