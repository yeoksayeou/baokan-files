    Promoting Biotechnology to Maintain Ecological Balance
    China's Biological Control Area Expands

    The People's Daily, Beijing, July 27th — Reporter Chen Manzheng recently learned from the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences that after 10 years of experimentation and promotion, the area of biological control of crop pests in China has reached 300 million mu. Biological control not only promotes agricultural production but also, due to its advantages of not polluting the environment, maintaining ecological balance, saving energy, and reducing production costs, has achieved multifaceted results after being widely promoted.

    — Microbial pesticides show promise.

    In recent years, China's research and application of microbial pesticides have developed rapidly. The application area of microbial pesticides has reached over 100 million mu, saving a large amount of chemical fertilizers. For example, the use of Jinggangmycin to control rice sheath blight, from 1974 to 1984, a total of more than 600,000 tons were promoted and applied, controlling sheath blight on 660 million mu of rice, with a net increase in income of 3.4 billion yuan, and preventing the loss of 10.6 billion kilograms of grain.

    — Protecting and utilizing natural enemies to control pests.

    In the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and in seven provinces and municipalities including Guangdong, the area of protecting and utilizing natural enemies to control rice pests has reached over 50 million mu. The use of chemical pesticides has decreased by 46.5% compared to 1985. With the protection and utilization of natural enemies as the center and ecological control as the basis, a comprehensive pest control method has initially formed the characteristics and advantages of China's biological control work.

    — Strengthening the factory production of advantageous natural enemy species to achieve commercialization of natural enemies. One of the key projects of the "Seventh Five-Year Plan," the factory trial production of red-eyed parasitoid wasps to control corn borers, sugarcane borers, fruit tree leafrollers, and beet armyworms has been basically completed, with an annual treatment area of approximately 5 million mu.

    Currently, China has introduced natural enemies more than 100 times from over 10 countries.

    推广生物技术  维护生态平衡
    我国生防面积激增
    本报北京7月27日讯　记者陈满正日前从中国农业科学院获悉：经过10年的试验与推广，我国生物防治农作物病虫害面积已达3亿亩。生防不仅促进了农业增产，而且由于它具有不污染环境、能维护生态平衡、节约能源和降低生产成本等优势，大面积推广后带来多方面的成效。
    ——微生物农药崭露头角。
    近年来，我国微生物农药的研究与应用有了迅速发展，微生物农药应用面积已达一亿多亩，节省了大量化肥。如防治水稻纹枯病的井岗霉素，1974—1984年共推广应用6万多吨，防治纹枯病6.6亿多亩，净增收益达34亿元，挽回粮食损失106亿公斤。
    ——保护利用天敌，控制虫害。
    长江中下游及广东7省市保护利用天敌防治水稻害虫面积达5000多万亩，化学农药用量比1985年下降46.5％。以保护利用天敌为中心，以生态控制为基础的病虫害综合防治，初步形成我国生防工作的特色和优势。
    ——加强优势种天敌工厂化生产，实现天敌商品化。全国“七五”攻关项目之一，工厂化试生产赤眼蜂防治玉米螟、甘蔗螟、果树卷叶蛾、甜菜夜蛾等害虫已基本配套成功，年放蜂治虫面积约500万
  亩。
    目前，我国已从10多个国家引进天敌100多次。
