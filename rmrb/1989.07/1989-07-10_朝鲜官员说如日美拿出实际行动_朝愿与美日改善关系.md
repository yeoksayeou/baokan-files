People's Daily, Pyongyang, July 10th - Correspondent Xu Baokang reports: North Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Tan Renzhe today reiterated at a press conference that North Korea will not allow anyone to infringe upon the interests of the Korean people or interfere in North Korea's internal affairs. North Korea will not blindly follow others. If the United States and Japan take concrete actions, North Korea is willing to improve relations with the U.S. and Japan.

Tan Renzhe said that North Korea assesses and handles all issues on the international stage with its own standards and firmly opposes all actions that infringe upon its sovereignty.

Tan Renzhe said that if the United States withdraws its troops from South Korea and stops obstructing Korean reunification, North Korea has the sincerity to improve relations with the United States. If Japan abandons its policy of hostility towards North Korea, stops activities aimed at creating "two Koreas," and takes concrete actions, North Korea will also improve relations with Japan.

In discussing relations with capitalist countries, Tan Renzhe said that the North Korean government will, on the basis of equality and mutual respect, develop economic and technological cooperation and cultural exchanges with capitalist countries with which North Korea has not established diplomatic relations, and foster friendship with the peoples of these countries.

    朝鲜官员说如日美拿出实际行动
    朝愿与美日改善关系
    本报平壤7月10日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜外交部副部长田仁哲今天在记者招待会上再次重申，朝鲜决不允许任何人侵犯朝鲜民族的利益，干涉朝鲜内政。朝鲜也不盲目地随从别人。美国和日本拿出实际行动的话，朝鲜愿意同美日改善关系。
    田仁哲说，朝鲜对国际舞台发生的所有问题都是以自主的尺度进行衡量和处理的，坚决反对侵犯本国主权的一切行动。
    田仁哲说，美国如果从南朝鲜撤走美军，并停止妨碍朝鲜统一的话，朝鲜有诚意同美国改善关系。日本如果放弃敌视朝鲜的政策，停止制造“两个朝鲜”活动，并拿出实际行动的话，朝鲜也将同日本改善关系。
    田仁哲在谈到同资本主义国家关系时说，朝鲜政府将在平等、相互尊重的原则下，发展同朝鲜没有建交的资本主义国家之间的经济技术合作和文化交流，发展同这些国家人民之间的友谊。
