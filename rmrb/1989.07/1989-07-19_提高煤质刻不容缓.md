Northeast China is the country's heavy industry base, with an annual electricity consumption of over 90 billion kilowatt-hours. The power grid officials said: In the first half of this year, due to poor coal quality, the consequences were severe: First, the boilers burned unstable and frequently went out. From January to May, there were 21 incidents of boiler shutdowns. The Jinzhou Power Plant had 8 shutdowns in just 6 days from May 14 to 19; Second, equipment wear was severe, with frequent leaks in the four pipes (water pipes, steam pipes, oil pipes, coal pipes) of the boilers. From January to June, 90% of the accidents in thermal power plants occurred in boilers, and 80% of these were leaks in the "four pipes" of the boilers. Third, due to poor coal quality, the power output could not be increased. On June 9, the four power plants in Jinzhou, Qinghe, Liaoning, and Chaoyang could adjust the output of 28.1 million kilowatts, but actually only 19.7 million kilowatts were output, resulting in a shortfall of 8.4 million kilowatts. East China is an important window for China's opening to the outside world and a major base for light industry in the country, with an annual electricity consumption of nearly 80 billion kilowatt-hours. The power grid officials said that since this year, the calorific value of raw coal has significantly decreased. From January to April, the average calorific value of raw coal in the entire network was 4801 kcal/kg, a decrease of 6% compared to the same period last year, and the coal consumption increased by 26 grams/kWh. Other power grids in the Northwest and Central China have similar situations.

The main reasons for the poor quality of coal are as follows: First, some coal supply units have improper business ideas, substituting inferior products for superior ones, and prioritizing profits over national and user interests. Second, most local coal mines lack testing equipment and processing facilities; most state-owned coal mines rely on manual sampling, which has large errors and loopholes, making it easy for a few people to falsify data. Third, some coal mines prioritize quantity over quality, neglecting social economic benefits, and do not process the coal that should be washed and processed, leading to a rapid decline in coal quality.

The above situation has attracted the attention of relevant departments. Jiangsu and Anhui provinces, in conjunction with the rectification of the economic environment and the economic order, are comprehensively rectifying the coal market. Xuzhou City has established a Coal Management Office and formulated management measures, clearly stipulating that all units and individuals engaged in coal business must be re-examined and certified by the Industrial and Commercial Bureau and operate with the certificate; strengthen coal quality management, all coal production and business units must provide coal quality inspection reports to users, and seriously investigate and severely punish illegal acts such as adulteration and fraud.

The China National Coal Industry Corporation has made improving coal quality an important agenda item, requiring all levels of leadership to take practical measures to solve the problem of declining coal quality. Places with imperfect testing methods should be thoroughly rectified. Strengthen washing and processing to ensure the quality and quantity of coal for users. Proactively send personnel to user units to solicit opinions on coal quality and improve work.

The Ministry of Energy reiterated that coal is China's main energy source, and the quality of coal has a significant impact on the national economy. If the quality of our coal can be restored to the level of 1966, it can increase the production of pig iron by more than 2,000 tons per year, save more than 1.5 million tons of fuel, save more than 1.6 million tons of limestone, and save approximately 170 million yuan in fuel, solvents, and transportation costs. Improving coal quality is improving economic benefits. All enterprises should further rectify their business ideas! Both the economic benefits of the enterprise and the social benefits should be considered, and the quality of coal should be improved.

    提高煤质刻不容缓
    本报记者　刘燮阳
    东北是我国重工业基地，一年用电量达900亿千瓦时以上。电网负责人说：今年上半年，因煤质太差，带来的后果严重：一是锅炉燃烧不稳，经常灭火，1—5月份共发生21次锅炉灭火。锦州电厂在5月14日—19日的6天中就先后灭火8台次；二是设备磨损严重，锅炉四管（水管、汽管、油管、煤管）泄漏频繁。1—6月份火电厂设备的事故，90％以上发生在锅炉上，而其中80％是锅炉的“四管”泄漏。三是因煤质不好，发电机出力带不上去。6月9日这一天，锦州、清河、辽宁、朝阳4个电厂可调出电力281万千瓦，实际只有197万千瓦，欠发84万千瓦。华东是我国对外开放的重要窗口，也是全国轻工业的重要基地，年用电量近800亿千瓦时。电网负责人说，今年以来，原煤发热量大幅度下降。1—4月全网原煤平均发热量4801大卡／公斤，比去年同期下降6％，原煤消耗上升26克／度。其它西北、华中电网都有类似情况。
    造成煤炭质量不好，原因之一是一些供煤单位，经营思想不端正，以劣充优，以次充好，只顾赚钱，不顾国家和用户利益。
    原因之二，多数地方煤矿没有检测手段，没有加工设施；大多数统配煤矿靠人工采样，误差大，漏洞多，很容易被少数人弄虚作假。
    原因之三，一些煤矿重产量、轻质量，不顾社会的经济效益，该洗选加工的，也不洗选加工，煤质很快下降。
    以上情况已引起了有关部门的重视。江苏、安徽两省结合治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，正在全面整顿煤炭市场。徐州市已成立了煤炭管理办公室，并订出管理办法，明确规定：所有经营煤炭的单位和个人都要由工商局重新审查发证，凭证经营；强化煤炭质量管理，所有煤炭生产和经营单位，都要向用户送交煤质化验单，对掺杂使假等违法行为要认真查处，从严制裁。
    中国统配煤矿总公司把提高煤炭质量作为重要议题，要求各级领导采取切实措施，解决煤炭质量下降问题，检测手段不完善的地方要进行认真地整顿。要加强洗选加工，按质、按量地保证用户用煤。要主动派人到用户单位征求煤质意见，改进工作。
    能源部重申，煤炭是我国的主要能源，煤炭质量的好坏，对国民经济影响极大。如果我们的煤炭质量能恢复到1966年的水平，每年可增产生铁2000多吨，节约燃料150多万吨，节约石灰石160多万吨，节约燃料、溶剂和运输费用约为1.7亿多元。提高煤质就是提高经济效益，各企业要进一步端正经营思想！既要讲企业的经济效益，又要讲社会效益，把煤炭质量搞上去。
