The Sword Master of Duomo

Jiangsu fencing legend Luan Jujie was once hailed as the "Number One Sword in the World." For many years, no one in China's fencing world could surpass her. Finding a successor to the "Number One Sword" has been extremely difficult.

At this year's Youth Games fencing arena, people saw a young woman who closely resembled Luan Jujie in appearance, technique, and fighting spirit. This young woman is Xiao Aihua, an 18-year-old from Yangzhou. Many people started paying attention to her from the beginning of the foil finals and watched her all the way to the championship podium.

Xiao Aihua's natural abilities are superior to Luan Jujie's. She stands at 180 centimeters tall, with a tall and long-armed physique, giving her an advantage in competitions. Opponents struggle to reach her, often losing points instead. Standing on the podium, Xiao Aihua towers over the other six champions by a head. Such a physique is indeed rare in the world of fencing.

Technically, Xiao Aihua is becoming well-rounded, excelling in both defense and offense. In today's global fencing arena, winning with ordinary skills is nearly impossible. One must have unique moves and high-difficulty actions to catch opponents off guard. This time, Xiao Aihua showcased some new techniques, such as stopping abruptly during movement to launch an attack, which is considered a high-difficulty move worldwide. She executed these moves successfully, winning easily. Her dominance is evident from the final scores: she defeated Beijing's Zhao Xun 8-2 and her teammate Chen Wei 8-1. The scales of victory tipped heavily in her favor. According to coaches who previously trained Luan Jujie, Xiao Aihua's technical moves have already surpassed Luan Jujie's. The consensus is that Xiao Aihua has the potential to become the second Luan Jujie. Of course, Xiao Aihua still needs to continuously hone her skills to truly excel.

    多磨“天下第一剑”
    江苏击剑名将栾菊杰，曾被誉为“天下第一剑”。多年来，我国剑坛上再也没有人能超过她。接替“天下第一剑”的人太难找了。
    在本届青运会击剑台上，人们看到有一位长相和栾菊杰十分相像、技术动作和拚劲也像的姑娘。这个姑娘叫肖爱华，今年十八岁，扬州人。很多人从花剑决赛开始就盯着她，一直看到她登上冠军领奖台。
    肖爱华的先天条件比栾菊杰强，她身高一米八○，人高臂长，比赛占便宜。别人进攻不到她，反而失分。站在领奖台上，肖爱华比前六名其他选手高出一个头。这样好的身材，剑坛上确实不多见。
    技术上，肖爱华已趋于全面，防守和进攻都较出色。在当今世界剑坛上，要想取胜光凭一般的技术是难以实现的，必须有绝招和高难动作，使人防不胜防。这次肖爱华就显出一些新招法，比如移动中急停进攻便属于世界高难动作。她用这些动作，连连得手，轻易取胜。从决赛比分便可看出其厉害，她以八比二胜北京赵旬，以八比一胜队友陈玮，胜利的天平一直向她倾斜。据以前培养过栾菊杰的教练讲，肖爱华的许多技术动作已经超过栾菊杰。人们的看法是，肖爱华有希望成为第二个栾菊杰。当然小肖还要不断地磨练，才能真正成才。
