Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that China, as one of the permanent members of the Security Council, will actively promote the peace process in the Middle East.

Xinhua News Agency, Amman, September 16th.

Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Marwan Kasis exchanged views today on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the situation in Lebanon, and the Iran-Iraq talks.

Kasis first gave a detailed account of the history and current status of the Arab-Israeli conflict, pointing out that Arab countries and the PLO have made various efforts to advance the Middle East peace process. The current problem, he said, is that Israel has not responded positively to the efforts of Arab countries and the PLO. Qian expressed appreciation for King Hussein and the Jordanian government's role in seeking a just, peaceful, and comprehensive solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict. He reaffirmed China's support for an international conference on the Middle East issue under the auspices of the United Nations, with the participation of the permanent members of the Security Council and relevant parties, including the PLO. He pointed out that a political solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict is the trend of the times.

Regarding the situation in Lebanon, Kasis reported on the efforts made by Arab countries to resolve the Lebanese issue since the Casablanca Arab Summit in May and the recent visit of Syrian Foreign Minister Shara to Jordan. The Chinese foreign minister stressed the need to maintain Lebanon's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and reiterated China's support for the mediation efforts of the Arab League's Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Algeria "Three-Party Committee." Both foreign ministers expressed the hope that the Arab League's "Three-Party Committee" would succeed in mediating the Lebanese issue.

On the Iran-Iraq talks, both sides expressed the hope that Iran and Iraq would resume peace talks as soon as possible to achieve lasting peace in the Gulf region. The Jordanian side advocated that the two countries withdraw to their well-known borders. Qian said he would exchange further views on this issue with Iranian leaders during his visit to Iran in October.

Regarding Sino-Jordanian relations, both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries and were willing to consolidate and strengthen existing economic and trade cooperation. It is expected that the China-Jordan Economic and Technical Cooperation Mixed Committee will hold a meeting to discuss ways to expand bilateral economic and technical cooperation.

　　中约外长讨论中东局势
    据新华社安曼9月16日电　（记者陈如为）中国外长钱其琛今天说，中国作为安理会常任理事国之一，将积极推动中东和平的进程。
    钱外长是在今天抵达安曼开始对约旦进行3天的正式访问时，对记者讲这番话的。他说，他将同约旦副首相兼外交大臣马尔万·卡西姆及其他高级官员重点讨论中东问题，特别是巴勒斯坦问题。
    新华社安曼9月16日电　（记者陈如为）中国外长钱其琛同约旦副首相兼外交大臣马尔万·卡西姆今天在这里就阿以冲突、黎巴嫩局势和两伊和谈等问题广泛地交换了意见。
    马尔万·卡西姆首先详细介绍了阿以冲突的历史和现状，指出阿拉伯国家和巴解组织为推进中东和平进程作了种种努力，目前的问题是以色列方面对阿拉伯国家和巴解组织的努力没有作出积极的反应。钱外长对侯赛因国王及约旦政府在谋求公正、和平、全面地解决阿以冲突方面所起的作用表示赞赏，重申中国支持在联合国主持下召开由安理会常任理事国以及包括巴解在内的有关各方参加的中东问题国际和会。他指出，政治解决阿以冲突乃大势所趋。
    关于黎巴嫩问题，卡西姆通报了自5月卡萨布兰卡阿拉伯首脑会议以来阿拉伯国家为解决黎巴嫩问题所作的努力以及不久前叙利亚外长沙雷对约旦的访问。中国外长强调要维护黎巴嫩的独立、主权和领土完整，并重申中国支持阿盟沙特阿拉伯、摩洛哥和阿尔及利亚“三方委员会”所做的调解努力。两国外长在会谈中都明确表示，希望阿盟“三方委员会”调解黎巴嫩问题取得成功。
    在谈到两伊和谈时，双方一致希望伊朗和伊拉克尽快恢复和平谈判，以实现海湾地区持久和平。约方主张两伊撤回到众所周知的边界后面。钱外长表示，他在10月份访问伊朗时，将同伊朗领导人就此问题进一步交换意见。
    关于中约关系，双方对两国友好合作关系的发展表示满意，愿意巩固和加强现有的经济贸易合作。此间人士预计，中国约旦经济技术合作混合委员会将举行会议，讨论拓展双边经济技术合作的途径。
