Chinese President Yang Shangkun wrote in a reply to Norodom Sihanouk, leader of the Cambodian National Resistance Forces and Chairman of Democratic Kampuchea, on September 27 that China will continue to support the Cambodian people's just struggle.

In his letter, Yang Shangkun said: "I fully agree with and support the views and stance on the current situation in Cambodia expressed in Your Highness's letter. As Your Highness has pointed out, due to the Vietnamese authorities' opposition to establishing an international supervisory mechanism under the United Nations and achieving genuine national reconciliation in Cambodia, the Paris International Conference on Cambodia did not achieve the expected results. To ensure Cambodia's future independence and peace, Your Highness has insisted on the principle of a four-party coalition and put forward reasonable proposals, which have won the sympathy and support of the majority of the participating countries and the international community."

Yang Shangkun said: "The Chinese government has consistently advocated a comprehensive, fair, and reasonable political solution to the Cambodian issue. The complete withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia under strict and effective international supervision and the establishment of a Cambodian interim coalition government led by Prince Sihanouk during the transitional period are the two fundamental aspects of solving the Cambodian issue. Vietnam's announced 'unilateral withdrawal' without international supervision is unreliable and will not be generally recognized by the international community."

Yang Shangkun said in his letter: "I hereby reiterate to Your Highness that as long as Vietnam has not truly withdrawn all its troops from Cambodia and the Cambodian issue has not been comprehensively, fairly, and reasonably resolved, the Chinese government and people will, as always, continue to support the Cambodian people's just struggle until the Cambodian people, under Your Highness's leadership, achieve complete independence, sovereignty, and peace."

    杨尚昆复函西哈努克
    中国继续支持柬人民正义斗争
    新华社北京九月二十八日电  中华人民共和国主席杨尚昆九月二十七日在写给柬埔寨民族抵抗力量领袖、民主柬埔寨主席诺罗敦·西哈努克亲王的复信中表示，中国将继续支持柬埔寨人民的正义斗争。
    杨尚昆主席在信中说：“我对亲王在信中就当前柬埔寨形势阐述的观点和立场表示完全赞同和支持。正如亲王所指出的，由于越南当局反对建立联合国主持下的国际监督机制和实现柬埔寨真正的民族和解，巴黎柬埔寨问题国际会议没有达到预期的结果。为了保证未来柬埔寨的独立与和平，亲王坚持四方联合的原则立场，提出了合情合理的主张，赢得了大多数与会国以及国际社会的同情和支持。”
    杨尚昆说：“中国政府一贯主张全面和公正、合理地政治解决柬埔寨问题。越南在严格有效的国际监督下真正从柬埔寨全部撤军和在过渡时期建立以西哈努克亲王为首的柬埔寨四方临时联合政府，是解决柬埔寨问题的两个基本方面。越南在没有国际监督的情况下宣布的‘单方面撤军’是靠不住的，不会为国际社会普遍承认。”杨尚昆在信中说：“我谨向亲王再一次重申，只要越南尚未真正从柬埔寨全部撤军，柬埔寨问题尚未得到全面、公正、合理的解决，中国政府和中国人民将一如既往继续支持柬埔寨人民的正义斗争，直到柬埔寨人民在亲王的领导下获得完全的独立、主权与和平。”
