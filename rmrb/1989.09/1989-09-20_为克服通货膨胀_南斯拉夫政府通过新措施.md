To combat inflation, the Yugoslav government has adopted new measures.

BEIJING, Sept. 18 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Development Minister Bozidar Marandic today announced that the Yugoslav government has adopted a new package of anti-inflation measures. The main contents of the measures include strengthening fiscal discipline, implementing a tight monetary policy, reforming the personal income distribution system, and further liberalizing the import of daily consumer goods to break the monopoly of domestic enterprises. These measures aim to create conditions for Yugoslavia to overcome inflation and ultimately get out of the current crisis. The key tasks include gradually eliminating the huge losses of various levels of enterprises and institutions (the total amount has reached 13.5 billion dollars), restricting common consumption and general consumption, making various consumptions match the material possibilities, and at the same time formulating a unified national distribution standard. In the future, personal income will be determined based on labor achievements rather than the inflation rate. To avoid social unrest and other unfavorable factors affecting the implementation of the above package of measures and corresponding reforms, the Yugoslav government has also formulated new regulations to directly control the prices of municipal services and electricity prices, and established a federal-level fund for this purpose.

Since 1979, Yugoslavia has formulated two anti-inflation programs, but both have failed. In the past half year, Yugoslavia has made some achievements in expanding imports and exports and restoring industrial production, but the inflation rate remains high. Compared with the same period last year, the inflation rate in August this year reached 873.8%, and the living standards of residents have dropped significantly. High inflation has seriously threatened economic reforms and their achievements, causing social unrest. For this reason, the Yugoslav government has formulated the third anti-inflation measure.

　　为克服通货膨胀
　　南斯拉夫政府通过新措施
    本报贝尔格莱德9月18日电　记者严正报道：今天南斯拉夫发展部长博·马兰迪奇向记者宣布，南政府已通过新的反通货膨胀一揽子措施，其主要内容是通过加强财政纪律，执行大幅度紧缩的货币政策，改革个人收入分配制度，进一步放开日用消费品的进口以打破本国企业的垄断地位。采取这些措施，旨在为南斯拉夫克服通货膨胀以及最终摆脱目前的危机创造条件。其中重点任务是逐步消除各级企事业单位存在的大量亏损（据统计总数已达135亿美元），限制共同消费和一般消费，使各种消费与所拥有的物质可能性相适应，与此同时制定全国统一的分配标准。今后要根据劳动成果而不是通货膨胀率确定个人收入。为避免社会动荡等不利因素影响实行上述一揽子措施及相应改革，南政府还制定了对市政服务价格和电力价格进行直接控制的新法令，并设立了用于此项目标的联邦级基金。
    从1979年起，南斯拉夫先后制定过两个反通货膨胀纲领，但均未奏效。半年多来南斯拉夫在扩大进出口、恢复工业生产方面取得了一些成绩，但通货膨胀率仍居高不下，与去年同期相比，今年8月高达873.8％，居民生活水平随之大幅度下降。高通货膨胀已严重威胁经济改革及其所取得的某些成果，引起社会动荡。为此南政府制定了第三个反通货膨胀措施。
