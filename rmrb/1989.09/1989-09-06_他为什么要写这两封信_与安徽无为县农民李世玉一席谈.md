The day after the capital was restored to order following the counter-revolutionary riot, an ordinary farmer who was previously unknown published a letter in the People's Daily. The author of this letter was Li Shiyu, a farmer from Wuhui County in Anhui, located along the Yangtze River. In his letter, he expressed his sincere feelings, urging students who were striking, fasting, marching, and petitioning to "prioritize stability and unity, heed the Party and government's advice, and refrain from further radical actions."

Unfortunately, by the time this letter, written on the evening of May 19, was published, the situation had already developed in a direction completely opposite to the wishes of this farmer.

On June 26, Li Shiyu, with his persistent simplicity and sincerity, wrote another letter to the central authorities and the People's Daily. In this letter, he discussed the varied reactions to his first letter and offered his thoughts and suggestions on ideological and political work. This letter once again drew the attention of relevant central departments.

Why did Li Shiyu write these two letters? In early August, a reporter visited him in Mashan Village, Nitao Township, Wuhui County.

Deeply Appreciative of the Party's Policies

Li Shiyu is 39 years old, with a dark face and a slightly thin build. Seeing us, he appeared somewhat restrained. It was evident that he was a simple and hardworking farmer.

The host's home consisted of three spacious brick houses, with a "Yanwu" cassette player in the main hall and a 44-cm "Hongmei" black-and-white television in the inner room. I noticed that Li Shiyu's children were all wearing pearl necklaces. Seeing my curiosity, he explained, "In our area, every family raises pearl oysters, so pearl necklaces are not rare here." Looking outside the house, across from it was a low, old thatched cottage. He said, "That's where my siblings and I lived with our parents for over a decade. After we built the new house in 1981, we haven't had the time to demolish it yet."

The changes in Li Shiyu's family reflected the changes in the village. He said, "Our natural village has 26 households, and 24 of them have built brick houses. The remaining two households have already prepared the materials for building. This was unimaginable just a decade ago. At that time, my wife and I worked hard to earn those few cents of work points, we couldn't raise chickens, ducks, or geese, we couldn't weave straw mats, let alone build brick houses. We farmers genuinely support the Party's policies from the bottom of our hearts."

During the conversation, I learned that he was not a Party member or a village cadre, and he only had an elementary school education. Initially, I found it hard to connect the two letters with this ordinary farmer. This trip to Wuhui made me realize that Li Shiyu writing the letters was not surprising; he, like millions of other farmers in China, sincerely supports the line, principles, and policies of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Unwilling to See China in Turmoil

Li Shiyu's first letter was written as follows:

On the evening of May 19, he and his family, along with neighbors, were watching TV together. At that time, Anhui TV was broadcasting a live dialogue between provincial leaders and some student representatives from universities in Hefei. On the TV, some students were pointing at the provincial leaders and shouting loudly; outside the TV, Li Shiyu's mother and neighbors were discussing: "These people don't look like they're engaged in a patriotic movement!"

Li Shiyu couldn't sit still. He furrowed his brows in deep thought, from Hefei to the capital Beijing: The central leaders repeatedly expressed that the students' wishes were good, asking them to reflect their problems through normal channels and legal means, but why couldn't they listen? Instead, they adopted the radical method of fasting to petition? Under their influence, some cities experienced looting and vandalism, and there were even incidents of food hoarding. Even in a small place like Wuhui County, people were anxious, rushing to buy salt and matches.

He was worried about the situation. His conscience urged him to pick up his pen to advise the students to act rationally.

"You signed your name and address. Did you have any concerns at that time?" I asked.

"At that time, I did think about this problem, but I believed that I had the right to express my opinions. Our Party is wholeheartedly leading the nation to reform, and the achievements of a decade of reform cannot be erased by anyone. Why should I be afraid to speak the truth for the Party?"

After Li Shiyu's letter was published in the People's Daily, from June 12 to 29, he received 23 letters, most of which did not understand his actions, and some even ridiculed and insulted him.

Reading those mocking and even insulting letters, not only Li Shiyu himself, but anyone with a sense of justice would be outraged. Some people, who claimed to advocate for freedom and democracy, were brutally interfering with others' freedom of speech.

Li Shiyu excitedly told the reporter, "I didn't receive any reward, nor do I need any other benefits. I just wanted to express my true feelings. Even in ancient times, there was the saying 'When the country is in danger, every citizen has the responsibility to save it.' How much more so for me, a farmer who grew up with New China. I believe that the Communist Party is a great party. Although it has taken some detours, it has been fighting for the people's interests. We should unite with the Party to carry out reforms. Those who create turmoil think they are smart, but in fact, they are the most foolish..."

Li Shiyu's actions gained the support of local Party organizations and most of his fellow villagers. County, district, and township leaders visited his home, and he was invited to give a speech to the county's Party members on the "August 1st" Army Day.

Once Again Offering His Patriotic Heart

One of the important lessons from this storm was that ideological and political work must not be relaxed. After the riot was suppressed, Li Shiyu's thoughts focused on the issue of ideological and political work. He said, "Although in recent years we have been talking about promoting both material and spiritual civilization, in reality, promoting spiritual civilization is often just empty talk. Many people have become 'beggars' in spirit, with very weak feelings towards the Party and the state. At the slightest disturbance, they will waver. Just take the situation after my letter was published as an example. Why did some letters express misunderstanding and ridicule towards me? Even in our village, there were some discussions, saying that I was seeking attention, that I was shaking half a jar of vinegar, that I would be appointed an official in the future, etc. I personally don't care what they say, but I feel that many people's thoughts have been confused, and it is difficult to solve the problem of ideology. Therefore, ideological and political work must be carried out for a long time. Thus, I had the idea of writing another letter to the Party Central Committee and the People's Daily. On June 26, I went to the county to handle some business, then bought some letter paper at a store, and some stamps and envelopes at the post office. I leaned on the post office's table and wrote from 10 am to noon, finishing two letters, which I immediately sent out."

In his letter, Li Shiyu proposed four suggestions for strengthening ideological and political work: First, ideological and political work should start from the Party's grassroots branches, as they are responsible for directly propagating the Party's principles and policies to workers, farmers, and students. Second, ideological and political work should not merely copy and recite central documents, but should be linked to local conditions and truly implemented. Third, ideological and political work should be done for every ordinary worker, farmer, and people from all walks of life, even first-grade primary school students. Fourth, the most important aspect of ideological and political work is its continuity.

Li Shiyu, an ordinary farmer who graduated from elementary school and grew up with the republic, expressed his deep love for the Party and socialist motherland with a sincere heart.

His two letters are like a mirror, worthy of serious reflection by everyone.

### 他为什么要写这两封信——与安徽无为县农民李世玉一席谈

    他为什么要写这两封信
    ——与安徽无为县农民李世玉一席谈
    本报记者　刘建华
    首都平息反革命暴乱的第二天，一位名不见经传的普通农民在人民日报上发表了一封信。写这封信的是家住长江之畔的安徽无为县农民李世玉。他用一片真情劝告那些罢课、绝食、游行、请愿的学生“要以安定团结大局为重，听党和政府的忠告，再不要搞过激行动了。”
    可惜，这封5月19日晚写的信发表时，事态的发展已经完全违背了这位农民的善良心愿。
    6月26日，李世玉以执拗的朴实与坦诚，再次给中央和人民日报写信，谈他第一封信发表后引起的不同反响；提出了他对思想政治工作的思考和建议。这封信又一次引起了中央有关部门的重视。
    李世玉为什么要写这两封信呢？8月初，记者来到无为县泥汊镇马滩村采访了他。
              深感党的政策好
    李世玉，今年39岁，面庞黝黑，身材略瘦，见了我们，有些拘谨。可以看出，这是一位朴实而又勤劳的农民。
    主人住的是三间高大的瓦房，堂前摆着“燕舞”收录机，里屋放着一台44厘米“虹美”黑白电视。我注意到李世玉的孩子们都戴着珍珠项链，他见我好奇，便解释道：“我们这里家家养珍珠蚌，珍珠项链在这儿不稀奇。”放眼屋子外，对面是一座低矮的旧草房。他说：“那就是我们兄弟姊妹同父母住了十几年的地方，1981年新房盖好后，还没顾得上拆。”
    李世玉家的变化，是村里变化的缩影。他说，我们这个自然村共26户，已有24户盖了瓦房，剩下的2户也备好盖房的料了。这在十多年前连想都不敢想。那时，我们夫妻俩拚命挣那几毛钱的工分，鸡鸭鹅不能养，草席不能打，哪谈得上盖瓦房？我们农民从心里赞成党的政策。
    交谈中知道，他不是党员，也不是村干部，只有小学文化程度。当初，我很难把两封信和这位普通农民联系在一起。这次无为之行使我感到李世玉写信并不奇怪，他和中国亿万农民一样，衷心拥护党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策。
            不愿中国出现动乱
    李世玉的第一封信是这样写的：
    5月19日晚，他一家人和邻居坐在一起看电视，当时安徽台正在播放省委领导同合肥市部分高校学生代表对话的实况。电视里，一些学生手指着省委领导同志大声叫嚷；电视外，李世玉的母亲和邻居纷纷议论：这些人哪像搞爱国运动？
    李世玉坐不住了，他紧锁眉头沉思，从合肥想到首都北京：中央领导一再表示，学生们的愿望是好的，要求他们通过正常渠道、合法手段反映问题，但他们为什么听不进去，反而采取过激的绝食方法来请愿？在他们的影响下，一些城市发生了打砸抢事件，出现了抢购粮食的现象，就连无为县这小地方也人心惶惶，纷纷抢购食盐和火柴。
    他为局势担忧。良心催促他拿起笔来劝说学生理智从事。
    “你署了姓名和地址，在当时的情况下有没有顾虑？”我问。
    “当时我是想到了这个问题，但我认为，我有发表自己看法的权利。我们党一心一意领导全国人民搞改革，十年改革的成果谁也抹杀不了。我为党说真话怕什么？”
    李世玉的信在人民日报上发表后，从6月12日到29日，他陆续收到23封来信，其中大多数来信对他的做法表示不理解，有的甚至讽刺、辱骂他。
    读了那些挖苦甚至是辱骂的信，不要说李世玉本人，连稍有正义感的人也会气愤。有些人口口声声大谈自由、民主，却粗暴地干涉别人的言论自由。
    李世玉激动地对记者说：“我没有得到任何奖金，也不需要别的什么好处。我只想说出我的心里话。古人还有‘天下兴亡、匹夫有责’之说，何况我是与新中国一起成长的农民。我认为，共产党是伟大的党，虽然走过一些弯路，但她为了人民的利益而奋斗，我们就该与党同心同德搞改革。那些搞动乱的人自以为聪明，其实最愚蠢……”
    李世玉的做法，获得了地方党组织和大多数乡亲的支持。县、区、镇领导人去他家看望了他，并请他在“八一”建军节时向县直机关党员做报告。
              再次献上爱国心
    这场风雨昭示的重要经验教训之一，就是决不能放松思想政治工作。平息暴乱后，李世玉的思考又集中在思想政治工作问题上。他说：“尽管这几年我们讲两个文明一起抓，实际上，抓精神文明往往是句空话。不少人成了精神上的‘乞丐’，对党和国家的感情非常淡薄，一有风吹草动，就会摇摆。就拿我的信见报后的情况来说，为什么有些来信对我表示不理解和嘲讽挖苦，连我们村也有些议论，说我好出风头啦，半坛醋就晃啦，以后会封我官啦，等等。我个人倒不在乎他们说什么，但我觉得许多人的思想被搞乱了，要解决思想问题很困难，因而，思想政治工作必须长期坚持下去。于是，我又萌发了给党中央和人民日报写信的念头。6月26日，我去县城办事，然后到商店买了信纸，又到邮局买了邮票、信封，伏在邮局的桌子上，从上午10点写到中午12点，写完两封信，随即发出。”
    在信中，李世玉提出了加强思想政治工作的四点建议：一、思想政治工作要从党的最基层支部抓起，因为他们肩负着直接向工人、农民、学生宣传党的方针、政策的任务。二、做思想政治工作，不能只照搬照念中央文件，敷衍了事，必须联系本地情况，真正落到实处。三、思想政治工作要做到每个普通工人、农民及各界群众直至一年级小学生身上。四、思想政治工作最重要的一条，就是持久性。
    李世玉，一个小学毕业的与共和国同龄的普通农民，凭着一颗正直的心，表达了他对党对社会主义祖国的无比热爱。
    他的两封信，犹如一面镜子，很值得人们认真照一照。
