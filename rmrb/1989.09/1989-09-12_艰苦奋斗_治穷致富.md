Our great socialist motherland has traversed a glorious 40-year journey. Over these 40 years, Gansu, like other parts of the country, has undergone tremendous changes.

For a long time, Gansu has been a mysterious and unfamiliar land in the minds of people. While it boasts the famous Silk Road and the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, it is more known for its vast deserts and barren loess plateaus. The phrases "The land of Gansu is the most desolate in the world" and "The spring breeze does not pass through the Jade Gate Pass" truly reflect the harsh living conditions and natural environment. However, this chapter of history has been turned over with the development and changes of the past 40 years.

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of all ethnic groups in the province have followed the socialist path, striving tirelessly to overcome poverty and backwardness. They have achieved tremendous successes. In agriculture, 289 large, medium, and small reservoirs and over 120,000 water and electricity irrigation stations have been built, increasing the effective irrigated area from 4 million mu in 1949 to over 13 million mu. The total grain production has increased from 2.06 million tons to 5.93 million tons. Modern industry has grown from nothing to a significant presence, with over 6,000 enterprises forming an industrial system that includes energy, steel, non-ferrous metallurgy, petrochemicals, and machinery, represented by companies such as the Lanzhou Chemical Industry Company, Lanzhou Refining and Chemical Industry Company, Baiyin Non-Ferrous Metals Company, Jinchuan Non-Ferrous Metals Company, Jiuquan Iron and Steel Industry Company, Lanzhou Petrochemical Machinery Factory, and the Liujiaxia Hydropower Station. Transportation, postal services, and logistics have formed a network connecting the northwest with the rest of the country. Science, culture, education, and healthcare have all made significant progress.

Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, Gansu has made significant strides forward in the past 10 years. Party organizations at all levels and the broad masses of party members and cadres have led the people of all ethnic groups to focus on economic construction, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and promote reform and opening up, creating the best period of sustained, stable, and healthy economic development in the province. The total social output value and national income have increased by 200% and 124% respectively compared to 10 years ago. Grain production has increased steadily for 7 consecutive years, reaching a new historical high this year. The poverty rate in rural areas has dropped from 65% to below 20%. In the central arid regions represented by Dingxi, the destruction of vegetation has stopped, and the people's living conditions have significantly improved. These areas, long considered "incurable," have found a way forward and seen hope. The naturally advantageous Hexi Corridor region has become an important commercial grain base under the drive of the "Three-West" construction.

Difficulties and hardships have tempered and forged the character of the more than 20 million people of all ethnic groups in Gansu, making them resilient, self-reliant, and forward-looking. From the 40-year journey, the people of Gansu have come to deeply understand that to change poverty and backwardness, relying on nature alone is not enough, and simply waiting and asking for help is also not enough. Only through hard work and diligent labor can poverty be overcome, and prosperity achieved. The achievements of Gansu over the past 40 years are the result of the persistent efforts of the broad masses of cadres and people who have struggled and worked hard on this land, generation after generation. They are the fruits of hard work and perseverance.

The achievements of the past 40 years are great, but the tasks ahead are even more arduous. We must follow the "three-step" economic development strategy set by the Party Central Committee, focus on the near-term goal of poverty alleviation and prosperity for our province, and further carry forward and develop the spirit of hard work and perseverance. We must ensure the implementation of the Party's basic line with this glorious tradition.

Currently, we must organize and mobilize the people of the entire province to do a better job in Gansu with the spirit of hard work, in accordance with the requirements of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. We must remain steadfast in maintaining consistency with the Party Central Committee, consistently adhere to the four cardinal principles, and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization. We must fully utilize Gansu's resource advantages, boldly promote reform and opening up. We must effectively carry out rectification and regulation to maintain the sustained, stable, and healthy development of the province's economy. We must further consolidate and develop a stable and united political situation to create a good social and political environment for reform and construction.

In a province like Gansu, with relatively poor foundations and conditions, achieving our grand goals is undoubtedly a very arduous task. Compared to other provinces and regions, we must make even more arduous efforts. "If others do it once, we do it ten times; if others do it ten times, we do it a hundred times." Every step forward requires more effort than others. We firmly believe that with the correct guidance of the Party's line, principles, and policies, with the spirit of hard work as our legacy, and with the 21 million people of all ethnic groups who are self-reliant, pioneering, and indomitable, no difficulty can stop our march forward.

From the perspective of social and economic statistics, Gansu's 40 years of development

　　艰苦奋斗　治穷致富
    中共甘肃省委书记　李子奇　省长　贾志杰
    我们伟大的社会主义祖国已经走过了40年的光辉历程。40年来，甘肃同全国各地一样，也发生了翻天覆地的变化。
    长期以来，甘肃在人们心目中是一片陌生而又神奇的土地。这里，纵然有令人瞩目的丝绸之路和敦煌莫高窟，但给人们更深的印象却是一片无垠的荒漠和贫瘠的黄土高坡。“陇中苦瘠甲于天下”、“春风不度玉门关”，就是群众生活贫困和自然条件严酷的真实写照。但是，这一页，随着40年的发展变化已经成为历史。
    40年来，在中国共产党的领导下，全省各族人民沿着社会主义道路，为摆脱贫困落后而艰苦奋斗，坚持不懈，取得了巨大成就。农业，建成了大中小型水库289座，水电提灌站12万多处，使全省的有效灌溉面积由1949年的400多万亩发展到1300多万亩，粮食总产量由206万吨发展到593万吨。现代工业从无到有，由小到大，企业总数达6000多个，形成了以兰州化学工业公司、兰州炼油化工总厂、白银有色金属公司、金川有色金属公司、酒泉钢铁工业公司、兰州石油化工机器厂和刘家峡水电站等为代表的能源、钢铁、有色冶金、石油化工、机械工业体系。交通、邮电、运输形成了连接西北与全国各地的运输通讯网络。科技、文化、教育、卫生等各项事业都有长足的发展。
    党的十一届三中全会以来，更是甘肃阔步前进的10年。全省各级党组织和广大党员干部带领各族人民，紧紧围绕经济建设这个中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，创造了全省经济持续、稳定、健康发展的最好时期。全省社会总产值和国民生产总值比10年前分别增长了200％和124％。粮食连续7年稳定增长，今年又创历史最高水平。农村贫困面由65％下降到20％以下。以定西为代表的中部干旱地区，植被破坏已经停止，群众温饱有了很大改善。这些长期被认为“没治”的地方，初步找到了路子，看到了希望。自然条件较好的河西地区，在“三西”建设的推动下，已经成为重要的商品粮基地。
    艰难和困苦，磨练和铸造了甘肃两千多万各族人民坚韧不拔、自强不息、奋发向上的特殊性格和图强意识。从40年的历程中，甘肃人民更加深刻地认识到：要改变贫穷落后，光靠天不行，单靠“等”和“要”也不行，只有靠艰苦的努力和辛勤的劳动，才能摆脱贫困，实现振兴，走向富裕。甘肃40年的成就，正是曾经在这块土地上艰苦创业过的广大干部群众，一代一代持之以恒地不懈努力得来的，是苦干实干、艰苦奋斗结出的硕果。
    40年的成就是巨大的，今后的任务更艰巨。我们要按照党中央确定的“三步走”的经济发展战略，围绕我省脱贫致富的近期目标，更加发扬光大艰苦奋斗的革命精神，以党的这个光荣传统保证党的基本路线的贯彻执行。
    当前，我们要按照党的十三届四中全会精神的要求，组织和动员全省人民，以艰苦奋斗的精神，把甘肃的事情办得更好。要坚定不移地同党中央保持一致，始终如一地坚持四项基本原则，坚定不移地反对资产阶级自由化。要充分利用甘肃的资源优势，更加大胆地改革开放。要卓有成效地搞好治理整顿，保持全省经济持续、稳定、健康地发展。要进一步巩固和发展安定团结的政治局面，为改革和建设创造一个良好的社会政治环境。
    在甘肃这样一个基础和条件较差的省份，实现我们的宏伟目标，无疑是一项非常艰巨的事业。与兄弟省、区相比，我们要付出更为艰辛的努力。“人一之，我十之；人十之，我百之。”我们每前进一步，都要比别人花费更大的气力。我们坚信，有党的正确路线、方针、政策的指引，有艰苦奋斗这个传家宝，有自强不息、开拓进取、奋发向上、百折不挠的2100万各族人民，再大的困难都阻挡不住我们前进的步伐。（附图表）
