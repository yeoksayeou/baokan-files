The Truth About the Shanghai Turmoil
Shí Yán

In the spring and summer of 1989, the turmoil in the capital Beijing, including the student movements, unrest, and counter-revolutionary riots, has been extensively reported in the newspapers, and the truth has been laid bare. However, the severe student movements, unrest, and local disturbances that occurred in Shanghai during the same period have not been systematically exposed, and people are still not very familiar with their origins and developments. Here, we record the entire process of the Shanghai turmoil in a realistic manner, aiming to help people understand the nature, roots, and harm of this turmoil, and draw useful lessons from it.

This turmoil was premeditated

As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out, this turmoil was the result of the influence of the international climate and the long-term prevalence of bourgeois liberalization in China. Due to the tolerance and support of Comrade Zhao Ziyang, the bourgeois liberalization trend has been intensifying in recent years. Some people, under the banner of "reform and opening up," have been spreading economic privatization, political pluralism, and Westernization of culture. In September last year, the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, in response to the serious mistakes made in economic work over the past few years, proposed the policy of rectifying the economic environment, rectifying the economic order, and deepening the reform comprehensively. Some people who are eager to promote bourgeois liberalization, especially some of Zhao Ziyang's advisors, with their keen sense of smell, sensed that the situation was not good and used domestic and foreign, internal and external propaganda tools to strongly oppose the rectification and adjustment policy, revealing political information of "overthrowing Deng and protecting Zhao." The World Economic Herald, which has a close relationship with Zhao Ziyang's advisors, published numerous articles after the Thirteenth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, spreading the idea that rectification and adjustment would inevitably lead to economic "stagnation" and "reversal of reform," and attacking Premier Li Peng's government work report at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, alarmingly proposing to prevent the reform from "going back on its tracks," separating rectification and adjustment from reform and opening up, and opposing them. Some newspapers in Hong Kong and Taiwan also maliciously referred to the reform as having reached a dead end. At the beginning of this year, the World Economic Herald unusually published in full the dialogue "About the Situation" by Yan Jiaqi and Wen Yuanke from the Economic Weekly in Beijing. In this dialogue, Yan Jiaqi bluntly said, "I think we should directly express our concerns about China's future," and "we cannot repeat the non-procedural power transfer of Khrushchev and Liu Shaoqi," and said, "many people have already sensed this trend." This key article was obviously intended to cover up Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, preserve his power position, and allow him to promote bourgeois liberalization unrestrainedly. During this period, the so-called "elite" figures in Shanghai and Beijing frequently traveled between the two cities, holding seminars and publishing articles, openly and covertly engaging in a large number of extremely abnormal activities.

Just like the end of 1986 and the beginning of 1987, a few people placed the main target of inciting unrest on young students who lack political struggle experience. Since the beginning of this year, they have used colleges and universities as a base, under the guise of "theoretical research" and "academic discussion," spreading a series of blatantly anti-party and anti-socialist views. Some people secretly posted posters in Shanghai universities, inciting students with phrases like "crisis! crisis! crisis! crisis of faith! crisis of the system! crisis of the future! The sense of historical responsibility urges us college students to stand at the forefront of the times"; openly calling for "forming organizations" and "establishing clubs" to "jointly study the current society." Some people used poetry, drama, novels, and big-character posters to "commemorate the 1986 student movement," inciting students to "take to the streets, shout for democracy, freedom, and human rights." Some people secretly connected with students, maliciously spreading rumors that "Beijing will take to the streets on May 4th," "Shanghai will definitely be in turmoil this year," "we must use blood to commemorate May 4th," "we must make a big deal." At that time, someone in Shanghai universities proudly said: "Now the whole country is like a pile of dry wood, as long as Fang Lizhi and others come out to lead, this pile of dry wood will catch fire immediately."

The signs of turmoil were indeed triggered in the coordination and close cooperation of domestic and foreign forces. In January this year, overseas and foreign organizations continuously clamored for the "release of Wei Jingsheng and all political prisoners." Members of the "China Democratic League," including Chen Jun (a graduate of Fudan University in 1982), conspired with Fang Lizhi, Su Shaozhi, Yan Jiaqi, Bao Zunxin, Zhang Xianyang, Li Honglin, and others to bring the so-called "signature campaign" to Shanghai. Wang Ruowang responded immediately, claiming that "Shanghai cannot remain silent, we must rise up and catch up!" and colluded with a group of like-minded individuals to attempt to launch a signature campaign in Shanghai, "responding to the north," and putting pressure on the government. Wang Ruowang personally revised the draft for collecting signatures, identified more than 30 well-known figures, and studied the strategy of "easy first, then difficult, first separate, then combine." He also sent people to collect signatures door-to-door, preparing to send them to Hong Kong for publication.

The "China Democratic League" also extended its hand to Shanghai. This reactionary organization, which aims to "abolish the Four Cardinal Principles, release all arrested dissidents," and "promote the democratic movement on the mainland" as its "current working focus," took Shanghai as its main target this year. As early as the beginning of the year, it dispatched Tang Guangzhong and two others from the United States to infiltrate Shanghai, carrying handwritten letters and greeting cards from Hu Ping and Wang Bingzhang to Yang Wei, preparing to welcome Yang Wei at the prison gate upon his release, thereby expanding the influence of the "China Democratic League" and achieving its so-called "political landing." However, this plot was discovered in time by our public security organs, preventing their scheme from succeeding.

In March this year, many universities in Shanghai received a large number of "psychological warfare materials" from abroad, some of which attacked the rectification and opening up since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, proposing to "force Deng Xiaoping to step down dishonorably for the fourth time"; some incited university students to take unified national actions during the May 4th period, "to commemorate May 4th with blood." Given the above signs, many comrades in the Shanghai higher education system sensed that "the wind is about to bring rain," and took a series of preventive measures. However, "the tree wants to be still, but the wind does not stop." Just two days before Comrade Hu Yaobang's passing, the student union of a university in Shanghai received a letter signed by the "Guangxi University Student Union," advocating that "without small turmoil, there will be a Cultural Revolution-like big turmoil; without short turmoil, there will be a ten-year long turmoil. A little turmoil is not scary," and deceiving people by proposing: "Comrades in universities across the country, May 4th is coming, let us raise the portraits of Hu Yaobang and the banners of democracy, freedom, dignity, and rule of law." Unexpectedly, Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away at this time, and a few people saw this as a rare opportunity. They took advantage of the mourning for Comrade Hu Yaobang to immediately exploit the situation, incite the student movement, and create turmoil. Therefore, the occurrence of this turmoil at this time seemed accidental on the surface, but it was actually premeditated and long-planned.

The turmoil was manipulated and utilized by a few people from the beginning

The student movement and turmoil in Shanghai can be roughly divided into four stages: from April 15 to April 26, a few people with ulterior motives used the mourning for Comrade Hu Yaobang's death as a pretext to stir up a wave of rehabilitation for bourgeois liberalization; from April 26 to May 20, the student movement spread from schools to society, with large-scale parades, sit-ins, hunger strikes, and petitions as the main content, supporting the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation," supporting the World Economic Herald, opposing the April 26 editorial, demanding the recognition of illegal organizations, and demanding so-called "news freedom"; from May 20 to June 4, after the State Council issued the martial law order, large-scale parades continued, directly targeting central leaders and blatantly opposing martial law, and then launching "empty school strikes"; from June 4 to June 8, under the planning of the "High Autonomy Federation," thousands of students and a group of social scum colluded to take to the streets, destroy vehicles, block traffic, and cause the entire city's traffic to come to a standstill.

This student movement was manipulated and utilized by a few people from the beginning. First, it was reflected in the clear political purposes and turbulent nature of the big and small posters and slogans in the early stages of the student movement. One type was to attack the party and state leaders. On the night of April 15, when Comrade Hu Yaobang passed away, someone at the East China University of Political Science and Law posted a sign: "Yaobang, you died too miserably, China is too miserable." On April 18, Fudan University posted a big-character poster titled "Alarm Bell," openly shouting: "Dead or not dead, it's time to eliminate evil"; "Let God take away those who complete their historical mission, don't just take away Yaobang." On April 18, a big-character poster posted inside East China Normal University incited: "Democracy must be realized, freedom must be great, the government can be cursed." Another type was to incite students to rehabilitate bourgeois liberalization. Such as "investigate the truth behind Hu Yaobang's resignation and death"; "re-evaluate Yaobang"; "re-evaluate the 1986 student movement, restore the reputation of Liu Binyan, Fang Lizhi, and Wang Ruowang, return Fang, Liu, and Wang!" and so on. There was also a type that opposed the rectification and adjustment policy, inciting "overthrow Deng and protect Zhao." On April 22, a big-character poster posted at Fudan University called Premier Li Peng's government work report at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress this year "a declaration of war against the reformers"; and called the central leaders who insisted on the Four Cardinal Principles the "conservative faction," while sealing Zhao Ziyang, who passively opposed the Four Cardinal Principles and instigated the support for bourgeois liberalization, as the "reformer," and distorted the opposition between the Four Cardinal Principles and bourgeois liberalization into the struggle between the conservative faction and the reformer. On April 19, a big-character poster titled "Our Action Manifesto" posted at the East China University of Science and Technology said: "Reform is in danger, we can imagine what will happen if the conservative faction takes full control, China will lead to what kind of situation"; "We should take practical actions to support the reformers, like Moscow citizens supporting Yeltsin, support our reformers."

It is worth noting that at this time, the World Economic Herald rushed to publish the 439th issue on April 23, directly proposing two political slogans for this turmoil: one is to re-evaluate the merits and demerits of Comrade Hu Yaobang, and completely negate the handling of Comrade Hu Yaobang's resignation by the central authorities in early 1987; the second is to completely negate the opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and rehabilitate the so-called "citizens who suffered unjust treatment in the opposition to liberalization." The purpose of the World Economic Herald's proposal of these two political slogans, as Qin Benli himself said, is "to make Deng Xiaoping reflect." This issue of the newspaper naturally received serious criticism from the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and was ordered to stop publication. After that, some people from the World Economic Herald frequently visited major universities in Shanghai, using the student movement to create turmoil. Many big and small posters in universities also closely followed these two political slogans.

The student movement was manipulated and utilized by a few people from the beginning, which was also prominently reflected in the fact that behind the students and some illegal student organizations, there were always some "advisors" who provided strategies. They were active on the front and back stages, leading a large number of ignorant students from establishing illegal organizations, holding secret meetings, taking terrorist actions, to large-scale traffic disruption and creating disturbances, step by step getting on the car of turmoil.

At Fudan University, there was a group of seven teachers led by Ye Maqiang from the "Center for Culture and Communication" who formed an "advisory group." They openly announced to various student organizations at Fudan: "The advisory group is the highest decision-making body, and the decisions made must be executed." In this turmoil, almost all the activities of Fudan University students, such as sit-ins, hunger strikes, blocking traffic, and setting up barricades, were planned and directed by this "advisory group." Even the various propaganda materials made by the "Self-Governance Association" of Fudan and the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai in the later period were mostly drafted or revised by them. On May 26, Ye Maqiang even rushed to the secret meeting of the 21 representatives of universities held by the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai, analyzing the situation for the student leaders and pointing out the next "direction of action." He said, "Yesterday afternoon, our theoretical circle held a meeting, and we believe: first, if the higher authorities adopt a high-pressure policy, students should protect themselves, and the property of the 'High Autonomy Federation' and various school 'Self-Governance Associations' should be hidden for future use; second, we should prepare for a protracted war, not only to carry out parades, demonstrations, hunger strikes, and sit-ins, but also to go deep into the masses," and "to plant the seeds of the Enlightenment Movement, let it take root and sprout," and declared, "this is our overall guidance on the situation."

Chen Qiwei, the deputy director of the Economics Department at East China Normal University, played the role of a "mentor" for students in this turmoil, providing strategies for students, and gave anti-government speeches multiple times, openly inciting students to "overthrow the government," saying: "Our first goal is to make Li Peng impose martial law, now this goal has been achieved; the second goal is to overthrow the bureaucratic dictatorship government that is hostile to the people of the world." He also "guided" the students, saying: "We should not raise the slogan of overthrowing officials, because officials are not a phenomenon, they are a system, this system can be summed up in one sentence, one person goes crazy, the whole country suffers"; "This political system causes the current economic difficulties, social crises, and crises of faith." His inflammatory speeches were printed into leaflets and widely distributed, poisoning many young students.

Chen Lebo, the domestic economic department director of the World Economic Herald, was also a "brain" figure who directly manipulated and utilized students in the Shanghai turmoil. After martial law was imposed in some parts of Beijing, he "suggested" that the student representatives of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai and the "Middle School Autonomy Federation" (Middle School Self-Governance Federation) "meet to study the next direction of action." He proposed three "action guidelines" to the students: (1) Strive for basic citizen rights. This time we have obtained the right to parade, and we should have other rights. (2) Strive for the legalization of university student self-governance associations. Our approach is to take one position at a time, news agencies, trade unions, party branches, democratic parties, take one is one, reform one is one. (3) Seize every opportunity to carry out new enlightenment. This student movement is a cultivation, we should sow more seeds of democratic rights, and there should be some drastic actions, so that future generations can benefit.

At the same time, enemy forces from abroad and Hong Kong and Macau maintained many direct lines of communication with the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai. The "China Democratic League" frequently intervened in the student movement in Shanghai. Members of the "China Democratic League," including Xu Bangtai (originally a student of Fudan University), incited students to "establish an independent student union." The headquarters of the "China Democratic League" also dispatched Yang Wei to contact the leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai, providing "policy guidance" for the student movement. Member Chen Jun, in order to communicate information with the domestic at any time, specially set up a command center and a dedicated phone in his home in the United States, with Chen Jun on duty 24 hours a day, remotely controlling and directing the student movement and turmoil in Shanghai. The Nationalist Party intelligence agency in Taiwan was even more active in the turmoil, frequently sending various inciting "psychological warfare materials" to Shanghai, directing Shanghai's underground agents to "grasp the current situation, participate in the student movement, and report the results," and seize the opportunity to develop organizations. In short, various enemy forces and social discontented elements all tried their best to manipulate and utilize students, plan and intensify the turmoil, which is an undeniable fact. The turmoil showed the characteristic of "north-south coordination" from beginning to end.

The center and main battlefield of this turmoil was in Beijing, and Shanghai was a coordinated battlefield. A few planners, organizers, and commanders of the turmoil in Beijing and Shanghai used multiple channels, such as the "Three Schools and One Association" of Zhao Ziyang (Zhao Ziyang's "brain trust"), the Beijing office of the World Economic Herald, and the "High Autonomy Federation" organizations and students traveling between the two places, to incite Shanghai to "act in coordination with Beijing." Throughout the student movement and turmoil, "what wind blows in Beijing, what rain falls in Shanghai."

In the early stage of the student movement, Beijing universities appeared with many subversive slogans such as "overthrow the bureaucratic government" and "overthrow the dictatorial rule," and Shanghai universities also followed suit, step by step. The big-character posters posted in various schools had some cursing our government as "the most corrupt government," cursing our party as "a centralized party, a party that deceives the people and is unreliable"; some wanted to "overthrow feudal autocracy! Overthrow the tyrant! Overthrow the Communist Party, dissolve the government, reorganize the government." After the April 26 editorial of the People's Daily was published, under the instruction of Fang Lizhi and others, the "High Autonomy Federation" of Beijing immediately issued the "New Student Federation Order No. 1," changing the subversive slogans such as "overthrow the bureaucratic government," "overthrow the corrupt government," and "overthrow the dictatorial rule" to "oppose bureaucracy, oppose corruption, oppose privileges." At the same time, Shanghai also issued a "Notice" in the name of the "Shanghai University Student Federation" at Fudan University, uniformly stipulating that during parades, more emphasis should be placed on prices and corruption, and "absolutely not mention slogans like overthrowing the bureaucratic government."

When this "student movement" and turmoil "started with a small breeze," due to the Shanghai Municipal Committee and the municipal government issuing a clear statement on April 17, proposing to "prevent bad elements from exploiting the situation, stirring up trouble, and engaging in destructive activities"; and due to the full efforts of more than 50 colleges and universities in the city, as well as social forces, to do a good job of stabilizing work, time was won and the initiative was taken. Before May 4, in the 51 colleges and universities in the city and the 130,000 university students, only three colleges and universities and four to five thousand people took to the streets, and the teaching order was basically normal. However, after May 4, the situation changed dramatically. Zhao Ziyang's speech at the Asian Development Bank meeting made the situation deteriorate rapidly. Since the beginning of the "student movement" and turmoil, the majority of students who insisted on attending classes and the majority of cadres and teachers who actively worked with students felt discouraged. For example, before May 4, the situation was relatively calm at Jiaotong University, and many students discussed after listening to the Asian Development Bank speech that night: since taking to the streets to parade is a "patriotic movement," are we not patriotic if we don't take to the streets? While those who created the turmoil saw that someone in the central government publicly supported them, sensed the atmosphere, and became more brazen and unbridled, making the turmoil more intense and arrogant.

During this period, the student movement in Shanghai showed two major characteristics: one was to follow Beijing and support Beijing, and the other was to support each other with students and the World Economic Herald, strengthening their momentum. The leaders of the municipal "High Autonomy Federation" planned to form a "Shanghai University Student Delegation to Beijing" on the afternoon of May 10, and for this purpose, they held a press conference at Fudan University on the 11th, claiming that the main task of the delegation was to "question the State Council: What is wrong with the World Economic Herald, what is the responsibility of the editor-in-chief, etc." Before departing, the leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Tongji University called the "Beida Self-Governance Association" to ask them to send someone to welcome them. After the delegation arrived in Beijing, they immediately connected with the leaders of the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation." To strengthen the connection with the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation," the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai sent a liaison officer to Beijing, transmitting the situation in Beijing to Shanghai and the situation in Shanghai to Beijing every day. After that, the "Sanjiadian" square in Beijing University often saw posters of student actions from Shanghai.

On May 15, Shanghai students learned from the representatives of the delegation to Beijing that Beijing students began a sit-in and hunger strike on the 13th, and immediately took two "supporting" actions: one was that the delegation sent five people to immediately participate in the hunger strike on Tiananmen Square, while the remaining people continued to Beijing universities to connect, give speeches, and submit petitions. The second was that Fudan, East China Normal University, and Tongji University immediately posted a call for action, calling on Shanghai students to also carry out hunger strike actions. The students who went to Beijing to petition also called the leaders of the "Student Self-Governance Association" of Tongji University, reporting the schedule of Gorbachev's visit to Shanghai, asking Shanghai students to "take action" at that time. On the afternoon of May 16, thousands of students, graduate students, and young teachers from Fudan, Tongji, and Shanghai University of Technology took to the streets to parade, supporting the hunger strike and petition of Beijing students. That night, the "Shanghai University Hunger Strike Team" was established, and more than 50 students announced a hunger strike in front of the municipal government. On May 17, 18, and 19, the number of students participating in the hunger strike reached a maximum of more than 300.

At the same time, Shanghai universities had a large number of students going to Beijing to connect and participate in the hunger strike on Tiananmen Square. Just Shanghai University of Technology, during this period, students going to Beijing to connect reached 102. On the afternoon of May 19, someone from Shanghai universities learned from a telephone conversation with the leader of the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation," Wang Youcai, that Premier Li Peng would give a speech that night, and Beijing would implement martial law, "the information comes from above, it is absolutely reliable," and immediately followed the command of the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation," beginning to prepare for the "cooling down" of the hunger strike. The party and government cadres' meeting convened by the central authorities made a few people in the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai feel that their plot to intensify the turmoil through hunger strikes had completely failed, so they notified the hunger-striking students to withdraw on one hand, and took a series of more intense confrontational actions on the other, stirring up a wave of opposition to Beijing's martial law and attempting to overthrow the legitimate government in Shanghai, pushing the turmoil to further escalate.

First, they continuously organized large-scale demonstrations. On May 21 and 22, a few people from Shanghai universities held meetings in Fuxing Park, plotting that in the near future, they would "continue to parade in an alternating manner," that is, organizing various schools to take turns going out, students going out in batches to maintain momentum and preserve strength; proposing that the "near-term goal is to make Li Peng step down, and the long-term goal is to implement multi-party governance"; and deciding to formally establish the "Shanghai University Self-Governance Federation."

On May 23, the leader of the "Student Self-Governance Association" of East China Normal University said at a thousand-person rally in the school's Youth Square: "The students in Beijing are now exhausted, we Shanghai students should take on more, and transfer the focus of the student movement to Shanghai." At this time, the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation Southward Propaganda Team" and the "Special Action Team" swarmed into Shanghai. The leader of the "Southward Propaganda Team," Zhao Wenli (female, a student of the Law Department of Northwest Political University, Class of 1988), held a contact certificate issued by the Standing Committee of the "Beijing High Autonomy Federation," Gai Ling, carrying a large number of propaganda materials such as posters, photos, and speeches printed by various universities in Beijing, and other 10 people secretly came to Shanghai. They first had contact with Zhang Cai (also known as Yao Yongzhan, a student of Fudan University) and others, and then, under the arrangement of Zhang Cai and others, gave several inflammatory speeches in Shanghai University of Technology, Railway University, Fudan, and Jiaotong University, cursing the central leaders, saying, "Li Peng does not step down, we will come every day," hoping that Shanghai students would persist, and that returning to class was undoubtedly the biggest betrayal of the students in Beijing! After that, this saying became the "unified slogan" of Shanghai students, and they continuously organized a 9-day parade and demonstration.

Second, in coordination with a few people in Beijing who planned to convene an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, attempting to "abolish the martial law order and remove Premier Li Peng from office," the leaders of the "Self-Governance Associations" of Fudan, East China Normal University, Tongji, and Jiaotong decided to hold a so-called denunciation meeting in People's Square in the afternoon of May 25. The meeting organizers admitted that the purpose of holding this meeting was "to take advantage of Wan Li's visit to Shanghai, to let Wan Li know that Shanghai students are dissatisfied, and to urge the immediate convening of the National People's Congress and the central emergency meeting, to remove Li Peng, to legitimize and define the student movement." That night, the "Self-Governance Association" of Jiaotong University held a meeting with 2,500 participants, and a teacher from Shanghai Normal University (originally a member of an illegal organization) gave a speech titled "The Situation and Strategy After Wan Li's Return," inciting students to "focus on the convening of the National People's Congress, to appeal, to form a broad political force"; "this National People's Congress should have representatives from citizens and students and other strata, which is a right they should fight for"; "students should do ideological work for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, to let the Standing Committee understand the truth of the student movement," and so on. At the same time, someone from Fudan wrote to the Standing Committees of the National People's Congress in 29 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, inciting local "National People's Congress representatives to go to Beijing immediately," forcing the "reorganization of the government."

Third, in coordination with a few people in Beijing who planned to block the martial law troops from entering the city, they blocked traffic and disrupted the economy in Shanghai. After martial law was imposed in some parts of Beijing, the organizers of the Shanghai turmoil held several secret meetings, deciding that "if Shanghai is under military control, we will go out to block traffic, causing a de facto strike"; and divided the work according to the principle of "nearby schools first" to go out and block roads. During this period, they also sent a large number of people to the railway, wharf, airport, and military camp areas to gather information and observe whether there were any signs of military movements. At 5 a.m. on May 22, the leader of the "Self-Governance Association" of East China Normal University, under the pretext of "the troops will enter Shanghai to implement military control at 5 a.m. this morning," urgently mobilized six to seven thousand students, and at 4 a.m., they separately occupied the five bridgeheads of the Suzhou River, blocking the five major north-south arterial roads in the urban area for more than two hours. At 4 a.m. on May 24, 1,500 students from Fudan University also went to the Wujiaochang area, blocking traffic with a sit-in at the intersections of Siping Road, Hanjiang Road, Xiangyin Road, Huangxing Road, and Songhu Road for more than four hours. At the same time, the "High Autonomy Federation" also organized batch after batch of students to go to major factories and enterprises in the city to conduct inflammatory propaganda, attempting to incite workers to go on strike. However, the cadres and workers of all enterprises in the city firmly responded to the call of the municipal party committee and the municipal government to "stabilize the overall situation, stabilize Shanghai, continue production, and ensure life," and resolutely resisted these incitements and provocations, preventing their plots from succeeding.

Fourth, they organized "empty school strikes" to resist Premier Li Peng's demand for "unconditional resumption of classes." Due to the firm implementation of the spirit of the party and government cadres' meeting convened by the central authorities, various schools did a large amount of patient and detailed persuasion and education work for the students, and most students in various schools gradually returned to school to attend classes, making a few people feel that the situation was unfavorable to them. On the afternoon of May 28, the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai, according to the instructions of the Tiananmen Student Parade Command Department, incited tens of thousands of students to cooperate with the so-called "global Chinese parade," holding a large-scale rally and parade in People's Square. Members of the "Beijing Southward Propaganda Team" gave speeches at the rally. The leader of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai announced at the meeting: Shanghai university students would "return home from now on, causing a de facto strike." On May 29, the "High Autonomy Federation" issued a "Notice on Empty Schools" to all 51 universities in the city, advocating that "empty schools are the most thorough strike," "it is the strongest protest and silent negation of Li Peng's 'unconditional resumption of classes,'" "it is a brilliant episode in the patriotic democratic movement"; the empty school "will play the role of a sowing machine, expanding the influence of this democratic movement."

In just a few days, the "empty school strike" activity initiated by the municipal "High Autonomy Federation" quickly spread to most universities, causing a great impact and disruption to the Shanghai universities that had basically restored normal teaching order. Many universities, except for the graduating class, students from other grades rushed out of school in groups. The few people in the "High Autonomy Federation" did not stop at this, they planned to tear down the notices posted by various schools to restore and maintain normal teaching order; seize the school radio station or set up a private radio station; raid the printing factory, forcibly print leaflets spreading counter-revolutionary rumors; raid the power station, threatening school safety; assault public security guards, loot communication equipment; some students even went to the staff housing area to make trouble, trying every means to incite teachers to "stop teaching"; they insulted and cursed some university leaders who were firm in their stance and clear in their attitude, even threatening to search the homes of leading cadres, threatening to "search the homes of leading cadres." Some students who did not want to "strike and leave school" were insulted, not allowed into the classroom, and even had their clothes and belongings thrown out of the dormitory; they also stormed the examination halls, disrupting the normal teaching order. What they did was to push the fate of a generation of youth and the future of many students into a dangerous situation.

Various people intervened in the turmoil, quickly spreading it throughout society

The turmoil in Shanghai originated from the student movement and quickly evolved into a social turmoil, which is inseparable from the intervention of various people in society. As the "Ten Miles of Shanghai" of old China and the "nest" of the "Gang of Four," those who "wait and see" and fear that the world is not chaotic, and those who have long insisted on the bourgeois liberalization stance and engage in political conspiracies, they could not contain their joy from the beginning of the student movement, believing that "this is a good opportunity, an opportunity to change the current situation," and eagerly intervened. Taking the intervention of the World Economic Herald on April 23 as a sign, the turmoil quickly spread throughout society, evolving into a social turmoil.

The World Economic Herald was the "source" of this social turmoil in Shanghai. They claimed that "in the student movement, the Herald should play the role of the main character, and should bring out its own banner, studying how to change China's system." For this purpose, they used the 439th issue of the Herald to hold so-called "press conferences" multiple times, inciting students and the news industry to support the Herald, maintaining long-term pressure and momentum; on the other hand, they used the Herald's Beijing office to transmit the situation of the turmoil in Beijing to Shanghai in a timely manner, such as the targets of the turmoil in Beijing in this stage, the main trends, the opinions of Yan Jiaqi, Fang Lizhi, and others, and the different views of the central leaders on the turmoil and the Herald. Then, some people from the Herald quickly spread the relevant information through printing and distributing related materials, giving speeches in universities, and individually connecting with the organizers of the turmoil. The degree to which the Herald was involved in this social turmoil in Shanghai can be seen from the confession of the leader of the illegal student organization at Fudan University, thanking the teachers of the Herald for their "valuable guidance," and the self-disclosure of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai, "the latest news is found in the Herald, and the theoretical guidance is found in the Herald."

In the fields of theory, news, publishing, culture, and education in Shanghai, there were a few people who had long insisted on the bourgeois liberalization stance, had close ties with political forces abroad, and had intricate connections with the figures behind the scenes in Beijing who participated in the planning, organization, and command of the riots. They were also very active in this turmoil, jumping around.

The representative figure of bourgeois liberalization, Wang Ruowang, went on the streets to parade several times in this Shanghai turmoil, accepted interviews from foreign reporters multiple times, and frequently sent articles supporting the turmoil and opposing the party and socialism to foreign newspapers and magazines. In the early stages of the student movement, he proudly told people: "Look, there's a good show to watch, the day I've been waiting for has finally come"; "The month of May has not yet arrived, and a wave has been stirred up in April, more mature than the 1986 student movement, this event is definitely national, and it will definitely bring about a new turning point." After the April 26 editorial of the People's Daily was published, Wang Ruowang hurriedly wrote an article for a magazine in Hong Kong, attacking the editorial as "the death notice of the Communist Party leadership's march towards self-destruction." In mid-May, when some students in Beijing and Shanghai went on a hunger strike, Wang Ruowang incited, "I am not only the ancestor of bourgeois liberalization, but also the ancestor of hunger strikes, I have gone on a hunger strike four times in my life." He participated in parades with a banner on his back, writing "iron-hearted, pitiful and lamentable" on his chest, and "save the country, save the people, save the students" on his back. Wang Ruowang also said, "Some people are worried that if the Communist Party is overthrown, China will have no officials, what will happen in the future? In fact, this is unnecessary. Yan Jiaqi, Fang Lizhi, and others are all politicians, and now there are so many young and capable successors like Wang Dan, and there are people like Zhao Ziyang!" He also secretly compiled a list of cabinet members, proposing that "after the student movement is victorious, we should form a group with intellectuals, convene a national conference, amend the constitution, and organize a coalition government," truly losing his mind for personal gain!

Represented by Wang Ruowang, a few people who have long advocated bourgeois liberalization also incited and coerced some people who did not understand the truth, going on the streets multiple times to add fuel to the fire of the student movement and turmoil, pushing it to the extreme. Some news agencies, theoretical research departments, mass organizations, and even a few party and government agencies had a few people going on the streets with banners. Various "appeals" and "open letters" also frequently appeared. The Shanghai Writers Association also had a few people, under the incitement and instigation of Wang Ruowang, drafting "An Appeal to the World PEN Clubs" and "A Telegram to the National Writers Association and the People," attempting to use foreign public opinion to put pressure on the party and the government. For a time, various extreme reactionary views were openly spread, various political rumors to deceive people were widely circulated, and various anarchist behaviors to trample on democracy and destroy the rule of law spread everywhere. The normal production and living order of the city was seriously disrupted.

In this turmoil, Shanghai also had a few Communist Party members holding important positions in party and government agencies who openly opposed the central authorities. After the meeting of party and government cadres convened by the central authorities on May 19, they planned and drafted the so-called "Open Letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" by Shanghai Communist Party members, proposing to convene an emergency meeting of the central authorities, "withdraw Li Peng's May 19 speech," "denounce the April 26 editorial of the People's Daily," and "immediately lift the news blockade," coordinating with the activities of the "Three Schools and One Association" in Beijing. This "Open Letter" was copied and distributed in hundreds of copies to the news, theory, culture, universities, and enterprises in the city to collect signatures. It was immediately opposed by the vast majority of Communist Party members in Shanghai, criticizing this behavior as fearing that the world is not chaotic. However, the planners were still impatient to publish the news through a Hong Kong newspaper and disclose part of the list of signatories, causing a bad influence at home and abroad.

In this social turmoil, the graduate students and doctoral students of the Institute of Social Sciences of Shanghai were also a very active group, with their leader being one of the standing committee members of the "High Autonomy Federation." This group of people almost participated in all the destructive activities of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai in the later period. During the turmoil, they even held a series of lectures on "Current Political and Ideological Hotspots in China," attempting to spread the turmoil to a wider range. Starting from June 4, they also installed a high-powered loudspeaker on the ginkgo tree in front of the Institute of Social Sciences on Huaihai Road, continuously broadcasting the reactionary calls of "Voice of America" and other overseas radio stations. Until the morning of June 10, they still gathered about 40 to 50 people to demonstrate in front of the municipal party committee building on Kangping Road, shouting extremely reactionary and vicious slogans.

During the turmoil, some remnants of the "Gang of Four" were overjoyed. They privately discussed: "Seeing the current situation, our hearts don't know how happy we are!" "This time it's the 'Cultural Revolution'." They congratulated each other, "it's time to change the dynasty, the day to come out won't be far," and supported and incited the turmoil in various ways, attempting to "prop up the situation." According to the preliminary information we have now, 35 of the remnants of the "Gang of Four" in the city took the opportunity to openly act during the turmoil, of which 11 openly incited the workers' movement.

Some social dregs in Shanghai gathered 14 illegal organizations during the turmoil, which later merged into the so-called "Shanghai Workers' Self-Governance Federation" ("Workers' Federation"), proposing the so-called "organizing workers to go on strike, establishing their own armed forces, overthrowing the Li Peng government, and overthrowing the socialist system" as their "organizational charter," and colluding with the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai, gathering a group of social riffraff to parade, give speeches, distribute leaflets, spread rumors, further inciting and creating turmoil.

Beijing's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion eliminated the root cause of the turmoil, and the people of Shanghai quickly stabilized the situation

On the night of June 3, a counter-revolutionary rebellion broke out in Beijing, and the Party Central Committee and the State Council took decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The news came, and the organizers, planners, and commanders of the turmoil in Shanghai were in disarray, some hiding, some fleeing, and some like gamblers who had lost everything, desperately carrying out various destructive activities, pushing the turmoil in Shanghai to the extreme.

They first used the opportunity of the initial few days of information blockage in Beijing after the suppression of the rebellion to create counter-revolutionary public opinion, distort the truth of the Beijing suppression, and confuse people's minds. Starting from the early morning of June 4, various leaflets and small-character posters flooded the streets, especially the copies of Hong Kong newspapers spread through the printing machines of the library of Jiaotong University, which were used to print a large number of distorted reports of the Beijing suppression, and were distributed everywhere. The World Economic Herald also posted and printed copies of newspapers and pictures from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and some Western news agencies that fabricated "massacre in Tiananmen," "internal strife in the army," and "38th Army mutiny" in the bulletin board in front of the Institute of Social Sciences. Under the instigation of a few people, some student organizations in Shanghai universities formed so-called propaganda teams to go on the streets, using self-made loudspeakers and portable megaphones to spread various rumors. The "Self-Governance Association" of Fudan University also organized a group of students to go to the municipal government and some news agencies to play mournful music with a loudspeaker. Someone who claimed to have just returned from Beijing distortedly introduced the situation in Beijing to the onlookers, calling on citizens to carry out a "three-stop" movement, calling on other countries to immediately sever diplomatic relations with China, withdraw their ambassadors to China, and impose economic sanctions; and shouting, "party members should withdraw from the party, league members should withdraw from the league," "family members of military personnel should hang white mourning ribbons to protest," and so on. Tongji University and other universities even publicly broadcast the "Voice of America" and Taiwan's "Voice of Freedom" on the streets.

The few planners, organizers, and commanders of the turmoil in Shanghai, in desperation, intensified their counter-revolutionary destructive activities, inciting the blocking of major and minor traffic, causing a de facto strike, paralyzing the economy, and creating chaos in Shanghai. On the afternoon and evening of June 4, the "High Autonomy Federation" held two emergency meetings, deciding to take unified action at 4 a.m. on June 5, driving batches of students, with the cooperation of some social dregs, to go on the streets to intercept vehicles and set up roadblocks. According to incomplete statistics, from June 4 to 8, a total of 234 road intersections in the city were repeatedly blocked 979 times, more than 6,000 motor vehicles were forcibly stopped to be used as roadblocks, of which 16 were overturned, smashed, and burned, and 1,223 vehicles (including 1,017 public buses) had their tires punctured or smashed. At the same time, they also lay on the railway tracks in many places in the city, blocking trains, and disrupting railway transportation. The Guangxin Road and 11 other railway crossings were repeatedly occupied and blocked, and the railway transportation on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines was interrupted for nearly 50 hours, with a total of 281 passenger and freight trains unable to depart or arrive. On the evening of June 6, a serious disturbance occurred at the Guangxin Road railway crossing, where 9 train carriages were burned, more than 170 police officers and railway workers were beaten, causing direct economic losses of 5.7 million yuan, shocking and harmful.

The despicable act of blocking traffic throughout the city planned by a few people aroused strong dissatisfaction among the people of the city. Their original plan was that after three days of forced strike and market closure, combined with their reactionary propaganda, they could trigger a spontaneous strike and market closure by Shanghai workers, but the result was the opposite. The people of Shanghai, especially the working class, under the education and inspiration of the truth of the Beijing suppression, increasingly firmly stood on the side of the party and the government, and their resentment towards the creators of the turmoil became stronger and stronger. A few planners of the turmoil were concerned that if they continued like this, "it would arouse public indignation," and after a meeting, decided to change their strategy, organizing multiple small teams to storm factories, forcing workers to go on strike. Because they believed that "the pressure of workers going on strike for one day is equal to the pressure of students sitting for ten days." Starting from June 7, batches of student small teams went to Jiangnan Shipyard, Shanghai Steel Plant No. 5, Great China Rubber Factory, Baosteel, and other large factories, as well as Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory and other "disaster areas" during the Cultural Revolution, inciting workers to go on strike, but were firmly resisted by the party and government organizations and the vast majority of workers in these factories.

During this period, a few planners, organizers, and commanders of the turmoil also took risks and carried out large-scale terrorist activities. They incited university students to "manufacture and purchase weapons" and engage in "armed struggle" with the party and the government. On June 5 and 6, big-character posters were posted in Fudan University, Shanghai University of Science and Technology, and East China University of Science and Technology, inciting students to "abandon all illusions, take up various weapons and fight to the end with the pseudo-government"; "manufacture various chemical and mechanical weapons, spontaneously organize various action groups, destroy bureaucratic luxury cars, injure or even kill pseudo-soldiers, pseudo-police, and high-ranking officials, and destroy military facilities"; and even threatened that "it is not the enemy stepping on our corpses to advance, or we stepping on the enemy's corpses to advance." Some people from Fudan, Tongji, Jiaotong, East China Normal University, and the Foreign Trade Institute even openly incited students to make Molotov cocktails, hand grenades, "make chemical weapons," and "blow up gas stations and chemical plants," attempting to create chaos. Under their instigation, some students from Tongji University purchased a batch of fruit knives and watermelon knives. Some students lost their minds and carried out a series of smashing, looting, and arson activities: On June 5, some students from Jiaotong University stopped a repair car from the Sixth Bus Company, smashed the windows, damaged the engine, stole the tools, and finally overturned the car. On June 7, some students and social criminals burned a public bus on Route 75 in Jiangwan. On June 10, about 100 students from Fudan and Tongji, under the planning of the leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation," Zhang Cai and others, organized the so-called "Heroic Suicide Squad" to sit in and demonstrate in front of the Public Security Bureau, "protesting" the arrest of members of the "Shanghai Workers' Federation" by the Public Security Bureau.

The strong turmoil that occurred in Shanghai in early June, although fierce, was already the last gasp and could not play a big role. On June 4 and 5, the "High Autonomy Federation" could still mobilize 3,500 to 7,000 students to go on the streets, but by June 7 and 8, it was difficult to mobilize even a few hundred people. On June 9, the "High Autonomy Federation" held a so-called "memorial meeting for the martyrs in Beijing" in People's Square, and they had to mobilize for seven or eight hours in various schools before they could barely gather 4,000 people. After the meeting, a group of people rushed to the gate of the Liberation Daily, shouting slogans, burning newspapers, and storming the Huangpu District Government, using paint to deface the signs of party and government agencies, and the public called their violence the last leap.

It is also worth noting that after the suppression in Beijing, a few planners of the turmoil in Shanghai and Beijing attempted to move the center of the turmoil to the south, establishing the so-called "National High Autonomy Federation" in Shanghai to continue to resist. On June 3, the leader of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai, Zhang Cai, went to Beijing and found the secretary-general of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Beijing, Wang Youcai, plotting to "establish the National University Self-Governance Federation." Wang Youcai said: "Now part of the 'Beijing High Autonomy Federation' has withdrawn, part has gone missing, and part has hidden, the 'Beijing High Autonomy Federation' has no power to organize the 'National High Autonomy Federation,' it is better to set up the 'National High Autonomy Federation' in Shanghai." On June 9, Zhang Cai returned to Shanghai, originally wanting to do something big, but when he saw the situation changing dramatically, he found that the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai was also in trouble, so he wanted to escape to Hong Kong to establish the so-called "National High Autonomy Federation Preparatory Committee." On the afternoon of June 11, he openly defied the municipal government's notice issued on June 10 to ban the illegal organization "Shanghai High Autonomy Federation," refused to register with the public security organs, and under the "escort" of officials from a certain country's embassy and consulate in China, went to Hongqiao Airport, attempting to escape to Hong Kong, but was detained on the spot by our public security organs. On the evening of June 10, the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai held a standing committee meeting, lamenting that "in view of the current situation," "we should be prepared for a long-term struggle," "and should not make meaningless sacrifices." The "Student Self-Governance Association" of East China Normal University posted a big-character poster titled "Farewell, Teacher" that night, announcing that it would "dissolve itself immediately." On June 11, the "Self-Governance Associations" of Fudan, Tongji, and East China University of Science and Technology also announced their "dissolution" in the form of a notice or broadcast. In the following days, the leaders of the "High Autonomy Federation" of Shanghai either surrendered, moved, or fled, and thus the student movement that had lasted nearly two months in Shanghai gradually subsided.

In the suppression of this turmoil in Shanghai, the working class played a decisive role. After Mayor Zhu Rongji's television speech on "stabilizing the overall situation and stabilizing Shanghai" on June 8, that night, 100,000 workers and Shanghai cadres and citizens together went on the streets to clear the roadblocks, and on the morning of June 9, the city's traffic, which had been blocked for several days, was restored, and the two banks of the Huangpu River once again presented a scene of peaceful labor. The reason why the turmoil in Shanghai could be suppressed in one go with the help of the working class is that Beijing decisively suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, fundamentally eliminating the source of the turmoil, destroying their "nest," and giving the few people in Shanghai who created the turmoil a great deterrent. The truth of the Beijing rebellion, especially the brutal scene of a small group of rioters savagely harming the children of the people, gave the cadres and workers in the city a great education. Throughout the process of handling the student movement and stabilizing the society, Shanghai received timely instructions and support from the Party Central Committee and the State Council. Without the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and without the decisive actions of Beijing, the turmoil in Shanghai would not have been suppressed, and it would have been difficult to imagine the stabilization of the situation in Shanghai. The turmoil in Shanghai has been suppressed. This turmoil has left us with many lessons. Among them, the most important is probably the "five must not underestimate": first, the severity of the turmoil in Shanghai must not be underestimated; second, the severity of the spread of bourgeois liberalization in Shanghai must not be underestimated; third, the social basis of the turmoil in Shanghai must not be underestimated; fourth, the infiltration and sabotage of domestic and foreign hostile forces in the turmoil in Shanghai must not be underestimated; fifth, the serious ideological confusion caused by Zhao Ziyang's weakening of the party's leadership in Shanghai must not be underestimated. We should, under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Fifth Municipal Committee, carry out a thorough investigation and cleanup, eliminate evil thoroughly, and leave no aftereffects; at the same time, we should seriously summarize the past, open up the future, adhere to the party's basic line of "one center, two basic points," and continue to strive for the stability of Shanghai, the stability of the overall situation, and the long-term stability and prosperity of our party and country.

    上海动乱真相
    施岩
    1989年春夏之交，发生在首都北京的学潮、动乱和反革命暴乱，报纸上已作了详尽的介绍，其真相已大白于天下，而同一时期，发生在上海的严重的学潮、动乱和局部骚乱，还没有作过系统的披露，人们还不太了解它的来龙去脉。这里，我们以写实的手法，记录了上海动乱的前前后后，意在帮助人们了解上海这场动乱发生、发展的全过程，以进一步认清这场动乱的性质、根源和危害，从中引出有益的经验教训来。
        这场动乱是早有预谋的
    正如邓小平同志所指出的，这场风波是在国际大气候的影响下，国内资产阶级自由化思潮长期泛滥的结果。由于赵紫阳同志的纵容和支持，近年来资产阶级自由化思潮愈演愈烈，一些人打着“改革开放”的旗号，到处鼓吹经济私有化、政治多元化、文化西方化。去年9月，党的十三届三中全会针对过去几年经济工作中出现的某些严重失误，提出了治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的方针。一些热衷于搞资产阶级自由化的人，尤其是赵紫阳身边的一些智囊人物，凭借他们敏锐的嗅觉，预感形势不妙，便利用国内外、境内外的传播工具，竭力反对治理整顿方针，透露出“倒邓保赵”的政治信息，为这次动乱作了一系列思想、舆论和组织准备。与赵紫阳的智囊团关系极为密切的《世界经济导报》，在十三届三中全会以后，连篇累牍地发表文章，散布治理整顿必然导致经济“停滞”、改革“逆转”，并攻击李鹏同志在七届二次人代会上的《政府工作报告》，耸人听闻地提出所谓要防止改革“走回头路”，把治理、整顿与改革开放割裂开来，对立起来。港台一些报纸也别有用心地称改革已走上绝路。今年年初，《世界经济导报》又异乎寻常地全文转载了北京《经济学周报》发表的严家其与温元凯《关于时局的对话》。严家其在这篇《对话》中毫不掩饰地说：“我觉得应当直截了当地把对中国前途的这种担忧说出来”，“就是不能重蹈赫鲁晓夫、刘少奇那样非程序权力更迭的覆辙”，并说“这种苗头许多人已经感到了”。这篇重头文章显然是为了掩盖赵紫阳的错误，保住他的权力地位，以便可以肆无忌惮地推行资产阶级自由化。在这期间，上海与北京的所谓“精英”人物频繁往返，南北奔走，又是召开研讨会，又是发表文章，明里暗里进行了大量极不正常的活动。
    像1986年底、1987年初一样，极少数人把挑动动乱的主要目标放在缺乏政治斗争经验的青年学生身上。今年年初以来，他们利用高校这块阵地，打着“理论研究”、“学术探讨”的幌子，散布了一系列明目张胆地反党反社会主义的观点。一些人在上海高校内偷偷地张贴“海报”，蛊惑人心地说什么“危机！危机！危机！信仰危机！体制危机！前途危机！历史责任感逼迫我们大学生站在时代之前”；公开号召要“搞组织”、“结成社团”，“共研现时社会”。一些人以诗歌、话剧、小说、大字报等形式，“纪念八六年学潮”，煽动“走上街头，为民主、自由、人权而呐喊”。一些人则暗中串连，别有用心地在学生中传说“北京五四要上街”、“上海今年肯定要动”，“要用血来纪念五四”、“要大干一场”。当时上海高校有人曾洋洋得意地说：“现在全国好比一堆干柴，只要方励之等人出来领头，这堆干柴一点就燃。”
    动乱的征兆果然在境内外的相互策应、紧密配合下悄悄地引发起来了。今年1月，海外和国外一些组织不断鼓噪要求“中国政府释放魏京生等一切政治犯”。“中国民联”成员陈军（复旦大学82级毕业生）与方励之、苏绍智、严家其、包遵信、张显扬、李洪林等人密谋把所谓要求释放政治犯的“签名运动”引向上海。王若望闻风响应，声称“上海不能沉默，要奋起直追！”并伙同一批臭味相投者，企图在上海发起签名运动，“南北呼应”，向政府施加压力。王若望还亲自修改了征集签名稿，圈定了30多位知名人士的名单，研究了“先易后难、先分后合”的策略。并派人上门征集签名，准备发往香港登报。
  “中国民联”也把黑手伸向上海。这个以“取消四个坚持，释放一切被捕的持不同政见者”为近期目标，并将“推进中国大陆民主运动”作为“现阶段的工作重点”的反动组织，把上海作为他们今年工作的主要目标，早在年初就派遣汤光中等三人从美国潜入上海，携带胡平、王炳章等人给杨巍的亲笔信、祝贺卡，准备在杨巍刑满释放时去监狱门口迎接，以此扩大“中国民联”影响，实现其所谓“政治登陆”。后被我公安机关及时发现，使他们的阴谋未能得逞。
    今年3月，上海不少高校陆续收到大量来自境外的“心战品”，有的攻击十一届三中全会以来的拨乱反正和改革开放，提出“要迫使邓小平第四次不光荣地下台”；有的煽动大学生在五四期间搞全国性统一行动，“要以鲜血来纪念五四”。鉴于上述种种迹象，上海高教系统很多同志预感到“山雨欲来风满楼”，并采取了一系列预防的措施。然而，“树欲静而风不止”。就在胡耀邦同志逝世前两天，上海有一所高校的学生会收到署名“广西大学学生会”的《告全国大学生书》，鼓吹“没有小乱，就会出现文革那样的大乱；没有短乱，就会出现十年长乱。乱一点并没有什么可怕”，还蛊惑人心地提出：“全国大学生们，‘五四’即将来临，届时让我们高举胡耀邦的画像和民主、自由、尊严、法制的大旗”。出人意料的是，胡耀邦同志恰在这个时候突然病逝，极少数人认为这是个千载难逢的好机会，他们打着悼念胡耀邦同志的旗号迫不及待地借题发挥，煽动学潮，制造动乱。因此，这场动乱在这个时候发生表面看来似乎是偶然的，其实是蓄之既久，早有预谋的。
      学潮一开始就被极少数
      人所操纵和利用
    上海的这场学潮和动乱，大致可分四个阶段：从4月15日—4月26日，极少数别有用心的人借悼念胡耀邦同志逝世为名，掀起一股为资产阶级自由化平反的浪头；从4月26日—5月20日，学潮由学校向社会扩散，出现以“声援北京高自联”，“声援《导报》”，反对4·26社论，要求承认非法组织，要求所谓“新闻自由”为主要内容的大规模的游行、静坐、绝食、请愿；从5月20日—6月4日，国务院发布戒严令后，继续出现矛头直指中央领导同志、明目张胆地反对戒严的连续不断的大规模游行，继而发动“空校罢课”；从6月4日—6月8日，在“高自联”策划下，几千学生和一批社会渣滓沆瀣一气，上街破坏车辆、堵塞交通，造成全市交通瘫痪。
    这场学潮从一开始就被极少数人所操纵和利用。首先表现在学潮初期的大小字报、标语口号就具有鲜明的政治目的和动乱性质。其中一类是攻击党和国家领导人的。4月15日，在胡耀邦同志逝世的当夜，华东政法学院就有人贴出一条标语：“耀邦你死得太惨了，中国太惨了。”4月18日，复旦大学贴出一张题为《警世钟》的大字报，公然喊出：“本死不死，除奸更待何时”；“让上帝把完成历史使命的人收留去吧，别只召去了耀邦”。4月18日张贴于华东师大内的一张大字报煽动说：“民主必须化，自由必须大，政府可以骂。”另一类是煽动学生为搞资产阶级自由化平反。如“追查胡耀邦辞职、去世真相”；“重新评价耀邦”；“重新评价1986年的学潮，为刘宾雁、方励之、王若望恢复名誉，还我方、刘、王！”等等。还有一类是反对治理、整顿方针，煽动“倒邓保赵”的。4月22日，张贴在复旦大学的一张大字报，称李鹏同志今年3月在七届人大二次会议上的《政府工作报告》“是向改革派发出猛烈反击的檄文”；还把坚持四项基本原则的中央领导同志称为“保守派”，而把消极对待四项基本原则，怂恿支持搞资产阶级自由化的赵紫阳同志封为“改革派”，把四个坚持与资产阶级自由化的对立歪曲为保守派与改革派的斗争。4月19日张贴于华东化工学院的一张题为“我们行动的檄文”的大字报说：“改革正处在危难之中，我们可以想象一旦保守派全面掌权，中国将导致何种局面”；“我们应该拿出实际行动支援改革派，像莫斯科市民支持叶利钦那样支持我们的改革家。”
    值得注意的是，就在这个时候，《世界经济导报》抢在4月23日提前出版了第439期，单刀直入地提出了这次动乱的两条政治纲领：一是重新评价胡耀邦同志的功过，彻底否定1987年初中央对胡耀邦同志辞职的处理；二是彻底否定反对资产阶级自由化，为在反对自由化中所谓“蒙受不白之冤的公民”平反昭雪。《导报》提出这两个动乱的政治纲领，其目的正如钦本立自己所说的那样“就是要邓小平检讨”。这期报纸理所当然地受到中共上海市委的严肃批评，并责令它停止发行。在这以后，《导报》某些人就不断出入于上海各主要高校，利用学潮制造动乱。许多高校的大小字报也都紧紧围绕这两个政治纲领大做文章。
    学潮从一开始就被极少数人所操纵和利用，还突出地表现在学生以及某些非法学生组织的背后，都有那么一些出谋划策的“智囊”，他们活跃于幕前幕后，诱引大批无知的学生，从成立非法组织、进行秘密集会、采取恐怖行动，直到大规模破坏交通、制造骚乱，一步步登上动乱的战车。
    复旦大学有一个以“文化与传播”研究中心教师叶茂强为首的七名教师组成的“智囊团”。他们公然对复旦各派学生组织宣布：“智囊团是最高决策机构，决定的事一定要执行”。在这次动乱中，复旦大学学生搞静坐、闹绝食、堵交通、设路障等活动，几乎都有这个“智囊团”在参与策划指挥。甚至复旦“自治会”和上海“高自联”在后期炮制的各种宣传品，不少也是他们起草或修改定稿的。5月26日，叶茂强还跑到上海“高自联”秘密召开的21所高校代表会议上，为学生头头们分析形势，指点下一步“行动方向”。他说，昨天下午，我们理论界开了一次会，认为：“一是万一上面采取高压政策，学生要进行自我保护，‘高自联’和各校‘自治会’的财产应隐蔽起来，以备后用；二是要准备打持久战，不仅要进行游行、示威、绝食、静坐，还要深入群众”，“要把启蒙运动的种子埋下去，让他生根发芽”，并声称“这就是我们对形势的总体指导”。
    华东师大经济系副主任陈琦伟，在这次动乱中，一方面为学生出谋划策，充当“导师”，一方面多次向学生发表反政府演讲，公开煽动学生“打倒政府”，他说：“我们的第一个目标是使李鹏戒严，现在，这个目标已经达到了；第二个目标，我们是要把与全世界人民为敌的李鹏官僚独裁政府拉下台”。他还“指点”学生说：“我们不应提打倒官倒的口号，因为官倒不是一种现象，它是一种体制，这种体制用一句话概括，就是一个人发疯，全国跟着遭殃”；“这个政体造成当前经济困难、社会危机、信仰危机”。他的这些煽动性演讲被印成传单，广为散发，毒害了很多青年学生。
    《世界经济导报》国内经济部主任陈乐波，也是上海动乱中直接操纵和利用学生的“智囊”人物。北京部分地区戒严后，他“建议”上海“高自联”和“中自联”（中等学校自治联合会）的学生代表“聚会研究下一步行动方向”。他向学生提出了三条
  “行动纲领”：（1）争取公民的基本权利。这次取得了游行权，我们还应有其他的权。（2）争取高校学生自治会合法化。我们的做法是一个一个把阵地夺下来，报社、工会、党支部、民主党派，夺一个是一个，能改造一个就是一个。（3）要抓住一切机会，进行新的启蒙。这次学潮是一次耕耘，我们应该多撒下一些民主权利的种子，还要有点剧烈的行动，让后人有所收获。
    与此同时，国外和港澳地区的敌对势力也有许多专线同上海“高自联”保持联络。“中国民联”频频插手上海的学潮。“民联”成员徐邦泰（原复旦大学学生）鼓动学生“建立独立的学生会”。“中国民联”总部还指派杨巍与上海“高自联”头头接触，对学潮予以“政策指导”。“中国民联”成员陈军，为了随时“与国内关系互通信息”，专门在其美国家中设立了一个指挥
  中心和专用电话，由陈军24小时值班，对上海的学潮、动乱遥控指挥。台湾国民党特务机关在动乱中，更是频频向上海投寄
  各种煽动性的“心战品”，指挥上海潜伏特务“把握现状，参加学运，汇报成果”，并伺机发展组织。总之，各种敌对势力和社会不满分子都千方百计伸手操纵和利用学生，策划和加剧动乱，这已是无可辩驳的事实。动乱自始至终呈现“南北呼应”的特点
    这次动乱的中心和主战场在北京，上海是与之遥相呼应的分战场。京沪两地极少数动乱的策划者、组织者、指挥者通过北京“三所一会”（即赵紫阳的“智囊团”）、《世界经济导报》驻北京办事处以及两地“高自联”组织和学生南下北上的频繁串连等多种渠道，策动上海“与北京联合行动”。在整个学潮和动乱过程中，“北京刮什么风，上海就下什么雨”。
    学潮初期，北京高校出现许多“打倒官僚政府”、“打倒独裁统治”等颠覆性口号，上海高校也如法炮制，亦步亦趋。各校贴出的大字报有的咒骂我们的政府“是最腐朽的政府”，咒骂我们的党“是集权的党，是欺诈人民、靠不住的党”；有的要“打倒封建专制！打倒独夫民贼！”“推翻共产党，解散政府，改组政府”。《人民日报》4月26日社论发表后，在方励之等人授意下，北京“高自联”立即发出改变策略的“新学联一号令”，把“打倒官僚政府”、“打倒腐败政府”、“打倒独裁统治”等颠覆性口号改成为“反官僚、反腐败、反特权”。上海在同一时间，也以“上海高校学生联合会”名义，在复旦大学贴出一张“通告”，统一规定游行时多提物价、官倒，“绝对不提打倒官僚政府之类的口号”。
    当这次“学潮”和动乱“风起于青苹之末”时，由于上海市委、市政府于4月17日就旗帜鲜明地发出“通告”，提出“要严防坏人借题发挥，挑起事端，进行破坏活动”；又由于全市50多所高校的干部、教师以及社会力量，全力以赴地做好稳定工作，赢得了时间，争得了主动。在5月4日以前，全市51所高校、13万大学生中，仅三所高校、四五千人上街，教学秩序基本正常。但是，5月4日以后，风云突变，赵紫阳同志在亚行年会上的讲话，使形势急剧恶化。“学潮”和动乱以来，坚持上课的大多数学生和积极向学生做工作的大多数干部、教师感到泄气。如5月4日以前局面一直比较平静的交通大学，许多学生在收听了亚行讲话的当夜就议论纷纷：既然上街游行是“爱国运动”，那我们不上街的是否就不爱国了？而那些搞动乱的人则从中看到了中央有人公开支持他们，摸到了气候，从而更加有恃无恐、肆无忌惮，使动乱以更大的规模、更为嚣张的气焰越演越烈。
    这一时期，上海的学潮出现了两大特点，一是紧跟北京、声援北京，二是学生与《导报》互相声援，共壮声势。市“高自联”的头头们在5月10日下午策划组建上海高校学生“赴京请愿团”，并为此于11日在复旦大学召开记者招待会，声称请愿团主要任务是“质问国务院：《世界经济导报》错在哪里，什么叫总编负责制等等”。行前，同济大学的“高自联”头头打电话给“北大自治会”，要求派人迎候。请愿团到达北京后，立即同
  “北高联”头头王有才等接上了头。为了加强同“北高联”的联系，上海“高自联”向北京派出了联络员，每天把北京的情况传到上海，把上海的情况传到北京。从那以后，北大“三角地”广场就经常可以看到上海学生行动的海报。
    5月15日，上海学生从赴京请愿的代表那里获悉北京学生于13日开始静坐绝食，立即采取了两项“策应”行动：一是请愿团派其中5个人立即参加天安门广场的绝食，余下的人继续去北京各高校联络、演讲、递交请愿书。二是复旦、华师大、同济等校马上贴出倡议书，号召上海学生也进行绝食行动。赴京请愿学生还打电话给同济“学生自治会”头头，通报戈尔巴乔夫访沪的日程，要上海学生届时“有所动作”。5月16日下午，复旦、同济、上海工大等高校的数千名学生、研究生以及青年教师上街游行，声援北京学生的绝食请愿。当晚，成立了“上海高校绝食团”，50余名学生在市政府门前宣布绝食。5月17、18、19日连续3天，参加绝食的学生最多时达300多人。
    与此同时，上海高校又陆续有大批学生到北京去串连并参加天安门广场绝食。仅上海工大，这一时期进京串连学生就达102人。5月19日下午，上海高校有人在与北京“高自联”头目
  王有才电话联系中，获悉当天晚上李鹏要发表讲话，北京要实
  行戒严，“消息来自上面，绝对可靠”后，立即随着北京“高自联”这根指挥棒，开始作绝食“降温”的准备。中央召开的党政军干部大会，使上海“高自联”极少数人感到靠绝食来加剧动乱的阴谋已彻底破产，于是一面通知绝食学生撤回，一面采取了一系列更为激烈的对抗行动，在上海掀起了一股反对北京戒严和妄图推翻合法政府的反动浪潮，促使动乱进一步升级。
    一是连续不断地组织大规模示威活动。5月21日、22日，上海高校的少数人连续在复兴公园聚会，密谋近期“要不断地、持续地交叉游行”，即组织各校轮流上街，学生也分批上街，保持声势，保存实力；提出“近期目标，要李鹏下台，远期目标，实行多党执政”；并决定正式成立“上海高校自治联合会”。
    5月23日，华师大“学生自治会”头头在该校共青广场的千人集会上说：“北京的学生现在心力不济，我们上海学生要多分担一些，要把学运的重点转移到上海来。”就在这时，“北高联南下宣传团”、“特别行动队”等纷纷窜到上海。“南下宣传团”头头赵文利（女，西北政治学院法律系88级学生）于5月24日持“北高联”常委柴玲签发的联系证明信，携带北京各高校印刷的大量传单、照片、演讲稿等宣传材料，与其他10多人潜来上海，先后与上海“高自联”常委张才（即姚勇战，复旦大学学生）等有接触，并在张才等人安排下，先后在上海工大、铁道学院、复旦、交大作了多次煽动性演讲，谩骂中央领导同志，说‘李鹏不下台，我们天天来’，希望上海的学生坚持到底，复课无疑是对北京同学最大的背叛！”此后，这种说法便成为上海学生的“统一口号”，并连续组织了长达9天的游行示威。
    二是配合北京极少数人策划召开全国人大常委会紧急会议，妄图“废除戒严令，罢免李鹏总理职务”的阴谋，由复旦、华师大、同济、交大四所高校的“自治会”头头决定，5月25日下午在人民广场召开了所谓声讨大会。会议策划者供认，召开这次大会，是“要趁万里在上海之际，让万里知道上海学生不满，要求尽快召开全国人大和中央紧急会议，罢免李鹏，为学生运动正名、定性”。当天晚上，交通大学“自治会”召开有2500人参加的大会，上海教育学院的一个教师（原非法组织成员）作了题为《万里回国后的形势和对策》的演讲，煽动学生“要围绕人大的召开，进行呼吁，形成广泛的政治力量”；“这次人大应有市民和学生等各阶层代表参加，这是他们应该争得的权利”；“学生要向人大常委作思想工作，让常委会了解学生运动真相”等等。同一时间，复旦有人向全国29个省、市、自治区人大常委会写信，鼓动各地“人大代表马上进京”，迫使“改组政府”。
    三是配合北京极少数人阻拦戒严部队进城的阴谋活动，在上海堵塞交通、破坏经济。上海动乱的制造者们在北京部分地区戒严后多次秘密召开会议，商定“万一上海军管就上街堵交通，造成事实上的罢工”；并按“以就近学校为主”上街堵路的原则作了分工。在此期间，他们还派出大量人员，先后到铁路、码头、机场和驻军营房附近打听消息，察看有没有军队调动迹象。5月22日凌晨，华师大“自治会”头头以“今晨5时部队将进入上海实行军管”为由，紧急集合六七千名学生，于清晨4时分别占领了苏州河上的5个桥头，使市区5条南北主要干道被堵塞两个多小时。5月24日凌晨4时，复旦大学1500名学生也前往五角场地区的四平路、邯郸路、翔殷路、黄兴路、淞沪路等路段，以静坐方式堵塞交通，前后长达4个多小时。与此同时，“高自联”还组织了一批又一批的学生，分头到全市各主要工厂企业进行煽动性宣传，企图挑动工人举行罢工。但全市各企业的干部、职工，坚定地响应市委、市府关于“稳定大局，稳定上海，坚持生产，保障生活”的号召，对这些煽动和挑唆进行了坚决的抵制，使他们的阴谋未能得逞。
    四是组织“空校罢课”，对抗李鹏同志提出的“无条件复课”的要求。由于上海各高校坚决贯彻中央党政军干部大会的精神，对学生做了大量耐心细致的说服教育工作，各校大多数学生陆续返校上课，少数人感到形势对他们不利。5月28日下午，上海“高自联”按照天安门学生游行指挥部的指令，又挑动数万名学生配合所谓“全球华人大游行”，在人民广场举行大规模集会和游行。北京“南下宣传队”成员在集会上分头发表演讲。上海“高自联”头头在会上宣布：上海高校学生从现在起“空校回家”，造成“事实上的罢课”。5月29日，“高自联”向全市51所高校发出“空校公告”，鼓吹“空校是最彻底的罢课”，“是对李鹏所说的‘无条件复课’的最强烈抗议和无声的否定”，“是爱国民主运动的一个精彩插曲”；空校“将发扬播种机的作用，扩
  大这次民主运动的影响”。
    短短几天内，市“高自联”发起的“空校罢课”活动迅即
  波及到大部分高校，给已经基本恢复正常教学秩序的上海高校带来了极大的冲击和干扰。不少高校除毕业班外，其他年级的学生成群结队，匆匆离校。“高自联”的极少数人并不因此罢休，他们策划撕毁各校张贴的恢复和维护正常教学秩序的通告；抢夺校广播台或私设广播台；冲印刷厂，强行印刷传播反革命谣言的传单；冲变电所，威胁学校安全；殴打公安保卫人员，抢劫报话设备；一些学生还到教工家属区哄闹，千方百计鼓动教师“罢教”；对一些立场坚定、态度鲜明的高校领导进行围攻、谩骂，甚至到领导干部宿舍进行威胁，扬言要抄领导同志的家。一些不愿“空校罢课”的学生被谩骂，不让进教室，甚至把他们的衣被用具扔出宿舍；他们还冲击考场，破坏正常教学秩序。他们这样做，实质上是把一代青年的命运和广大同学的自身前途推到了危险的境地。
    各种人物纷纷介入动乱迅速向全社会扩散
    上海的这场动乱源于学潮，很快演变成为动乱，同社会上各种人物的纷纷介入是分不开的。上海作为旧中国的“十里洋场”，作为“四人帮”的老窝，那些“静观待变”、唯恐天下不乱的人，那些长期坚持资产阶级自由化立场而又搞政治阴谋的人，他们从学潮一开始就按捺不住心中的狂喜，认为“这是一个很好的转机，是可以改变当前情况的转机”，而迫不及待地介入进来。以4月23日《世界经济导报》的介入为标志，动乱便迅速向全社会扩散，演变成为一场社会动乱。
    《世界经济导报》是上海这场社会动乱的“策源地”。他们声称“在学潮中，导报应作为运动的主角身份发挥作用，要将自己的旗帜打出来，研究怎么改变中国的制度”。为此，他们一方面利用439期导报事件，多次召开所谓“新闻发布会”，煽动学生和新闻界声援导报，以“保持长期的压力、推进的势头”；一方面利用该报驻京办事处，随时把北京动乱情况传回上海，如本阶段北京动乱者的目标是什么，有些什么主要动向，严家其、方励之等发表了什么意见，中央领导对动乱以及对《导报》的看法有什么不同等。然后，《导报》的一些人就通过翻印散发有关材料、到高校去演讲、与动乱的组织者个别串连等方式，把有关消息迅速传播开来。《导报》卷入上海这场社会动乱的程度，从复旦大学非法学生组织头头写信“感谢”《导报》老师的“宝贵指导”和上海“高自联”的“最新消息找《导报》，理论指导找《导报》”的自白中可见一斑。
    上海理论、新闻、出版、文化、教育等战线，有那么极少数人长期坚持资产阶级自由化立场，同国外的政治势力有着密切的联系，同北京参与策划、组织、指挥暴乱的幕前幕后人物有着千丝万缕的联系，他们在这次动乱中也上窜下跳，极为活跃。
    资产阶级自由化的头面人物王若望，在这次上海动乱中，几次三番上街游行，多次接受境外记者采访，还频频向境外报刊投寄支持动乱、反党反社会主义的文章。学潮初期，他得意洋洋地对人说：“你们看，可有好戏看了，我盼望的一天终于来到了”；“5月份尚未到，在4月份就掀起了这样的浪潮，比86年的学生运动更成熟了，这次事件肯定是全国性的，肯定会产生出一个新的转机”。4月26日《人民日报》社论发表后，王若望急忙为香港一家杂志撰文，攻击社论是“中共领导层迈向自取灭亡的病危通知书”。5月中旬，北京和上海部分学生绝食，王若望煽动说，“我不仅是资产阶级自由化的老祖宗，而且是绝食的老祖宗，一生绝食4次”。他参加游行时身披条幅，胸前写着“铁石心肠，可悲可叹”，背后写着“救国救民，救救学生”。王若望还说，“有人担心，这一来共产党被打倒了，中国没有干部了，今后怎么办？其实这是多此一举。严家其、方励之等都是政治家，现在又涌现多少像王丹这样年轻有为的接班人，还有赵紫阳这样的人嘛！”他还暗中排列组阁名单，提出“学生运动胜利后，要同知识分子组成集团，召开国家会议，修改宪法，组织联合政府”，真是利令智昏到了极点！
    以王若望为代表的极少数长期鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人，还挑动和裹胁一些不明真相的人，多次走上街头，为学潮和动乱火上添油，推波助澜。一些新闻单位、理论研究部门、群众团体以至个别党政机关的少数人，也打着横幅上街。各种“呼吁书”、“公开信”也频频出台。上海作协也有那么几个人，在王若望的蛊惑和策动下，着手起草《向世界各国笔会的呼吁书》、《给全国作协及人民的通电》，企图用国外舆论向党和政府施加压力。一时间，种种极端反动的观点公开散布，形形色色蛊惑人心的政治谣言广为传播，各式各样践踏民主、破坏法制的无政府主义行为到处蔓延。城市正常的生产、生活秩序遭到严重破坏。
    在这次动乱中，上海还有几个身居党政机关要职的共产党员，公开同中央对抗。在5月19日中央党政军负责干部大会之后，他们策划起草了所谓上海市的共产党员《致中共中央公开信》，提出要求中央召开紧急会议，“收回李鹏5·19讲话”、“否定4月26日《人民日报》社论”、“立即解除新闻封锁”，同北京“三所一会”的活动遥相呼应。这份《公开信》复印数百份散发至本市新闻、理论、文化、高校、企业广泛征集签名。它一出笼就受到上海广大共产党员的抵制，指责这种行径是唯恐天下不乱。但策划者们还是急不可待地通过香港报纸发表了消息，并公布了部分签名名单，在海内外造成恶劣的影响。
    在这次社会动乱中，上海社科院研究生部的部分博士生、硕士生也是一支极为活跃的队伍，其头头是“高自联”常委之一。这批人几乎参与了上海“高自联”中后期的所有的破坏活动。就在动乱期间，他们还举办了所谓“当前中国政治和思想热点”系列讲座，企图把动乱扩散到更广的范围。从6月4日开始，他们还在淮海中路闹市区社科院门口梧桐树上安上高音喇叭，连续不断地播放“美国之音”等海外电台的反动叫嚣。直到6月10日上午，他们还纠集了四五十人，到康平路市委机关外面游行示威，喊叫一些非常反动、恶毒的口号。
    动乱期间，一些“四人帮”残余分子得意忘形。他们私下里议论说：看到“现在这种形势，我们‘造’字头心里不晓得有多高兴！”“这次搞的就是‘文化大革命’。”他们相互庆贺“要改朝换代了”，“出头的日子不会太远了”；还采取各种方式支持和煽动闹事，妄图“出来撑一下局面”。据现在初步掌握的情况，本市“四人帮”残余分子在动乱期间乘机公开活动的就有35名，其中，公然跳出来煽动工潮的就有11名。
    上海的一些社会渣滓在动乱中先后拼凑了14个非法组织，后来凑合成所谓“上海工人自治联合会”（“工自联”），提出了所谓“组织工人罢工，建立自己的武装，打倒李鹏政府，推翻社会主义制度”的“组织纲领”，并与上海“高自联”勾结在一起，纠集社会上的一些乌合之众，游行、演讲、发传单、造谣言，进一步煽动和制造动乱。
      北京“平暴”铲除动乱根源
  上海人民一举稳定大局
    6月3日晚，北京发生反革命暴乱，党中央、国务院采取果断措施，一举平息反革命暴乱。消息传来，上海动乱的组织者、策划者、指挥者们乱了阵脚，躲的躲，逃的逃，也有的像输光了的赌徒那样孤注一掷，疯狂进行各种破坏，将上海这场动乱推向极端。
    他们首先利用平暴初期北京有几天信息不畅的机会，大造反革命舆论，歪曲北京平暴事件的真相，搞乱人们的思想。从6月4日凌晨起，各种传单、小字报充斥街头，特别是通过港报复印件传播所谓“北京镇压真相”。交通大学图书馆的复印设备，竟被一些人用来大量复印歪曲北京平暴真相的香港报纸，并四处散发。《世界经济导报》在社科院门前的阅报栏里也连篇累牍地复印、张贴港台及西方一些新闻机构编造的“血洗天安门”、“军队内部火并”、“38军倒戈”等谣言的报刊及图片。在极少数人策动下，上海高校一些学生组织了所谓的宣传队走上街头，用自制广播台和手提喇叭传送各种谣言。复旦大学“自治会”还组织一批学生到市政府和一些新闻单位门口用高音喇叭放哀乐。有个自称是刚从北京回来的人向围观者歪曲地介绍北京情况，呼吁市民进行“三罢”，呼吁其他国家立即与中国断交，撤回驻华大使，进行经济制裁；并叫喊“党员要退党，团员要退团”，“军人家属要挂白色挽联进行抗议”等等。同济等高校甚至在马路上拉出广播喇叭公开播送“美国之音”和台湾
  “自由之声”等电台的反华反共广播。
    上海动乱的极少数策划者、组织者和指挥者在绝望中加紧了反革命破坏活动，策动堵塞大小交通，造成事实上的停工、停市，搞瘫经济，搞乱上海。6月4日下午和晚上，“高自联”两次召开紧急会议，决定6月5日凌晨4时统一行动，驱使成批学生在一些社会渣滓配合下，上街拦截车辆，设置路障。据不完全统计，在6月4日至8日的5天内，全市共有234个马路道口被反复堵塞979次，有6000多辆机动车被强行拦停用作路障，其中有16辆被掀翻、砸毁、烧坏，有1223辆（内公交车1017辆）被戳破轮胎或砸坏。与此同时，他们还在市内许多铁路道口卧轨，拦截火车，破坏铁路运输。光新路等11个铁路道口被反复占据、堵塞，沪宁、沪杭线铁路运输中断近50个小时，共有281列客货列车无法到发。6月6日晚，在铁路光新路道口还发生了焚烧列车、殴打司机和公安干警的严重骚乱事件。在这次骚乱中，共烧毁了9节列车车厢，殴打170多位民警和铁路职工，直接经济损失达570万元，骇人听闻，影响极坏。
    极少数人策划的堵塞全市交通的卑劣行径激起全市人民的强烈不满。他们原先的如意算盘是，经过3天的强制性的停工、停市，加上他们的反动宣传，就可以引发上海工人自觉的罢工、罢市，谁知结果适得其反。上海人民，特别是工人阶级，在北京平暴真相的教育和感召下，日益坚定地站到了党和政府的一边，对动乱制造者的怨愤越来越强烈。极少数动乱策划者担心再这样搞下去“会激起民愤”，经开会研究，决定改变策略，组织多路小分队冲击工厂，迫使工人罢工。因为他们认为“工人一天罢工的压力，等于学生十天静坐的压力”。从6月7日起，成批学生小分队便来到了江南造船厂、上钢五厂、大中华橡胶厂、宝钢等一批大厂以及上海柴油机厂等“文革”中的“重灾区”煽动工人罢工，遭到这些工厂党政组织和广大工人的坚决抵制。
    这段时间里，极少数动乱的策划者、组织者和指挥者，还铤而走险，大搞恐怖活动。他们煽动大学生“制造、购买武器”，同党和政府进行“武装斗争”。6月5日至6日，在复旦大学、上海科大、华东化工学院分别贴出鼓动恐怖活动的大字报，煽动学生“抛去一切幻想，拿起各种武器同伪政府战斗到底”；
  “自制各种化学、机械武器，自发组织各种行动小组，破坏官僚豪华汽车，打伤甚至杀掉伪军、伪警和各级高级官员，破坏军方设施”；还扬言“不是敌人踩着我们的尸体前进，就是我们踩着敌人的尸体前进”。复旦、同济、交大、华师大、外贸学院的一些人甚至公然煽动学生自制燃烧瓶、手榴弹，“搞化学武器”、“爆炸加油站、化工厂”，企图制造大乱。在他们的挑唆下，
  同济一些学生购置了一批水果刀和西瓜刀。一些学生头脑发热，干出了一系列打、砸、抢、烧活动：6月5日，工大部分学生将公交六场一辆抢修车拦住，砸碎玻璃，砸坏发动机，抢走工具，最后将车身掀翻。6月7日，在江湾五角场，一些学
  生和社会不法分子将一辆公交75路公共汽车放火燃烧。6月10
  日，复旦、同济约100多名学生还在“高自联”头头张才等人
  策划下，组织了所谓“英雄敢死队”，到市公安局门口静坐、示
  威，“抗议”公安局逮捕上海“工自联”成员。
    6月初在上海出现的连续几天强烈的动乱，虽然其势汹汹，但毕竟已是强弩之末，起不了多大作用。6月4日、5日，“高自联”还能先后动员3500到7000学生上街，到7日、8日，要动员几百人都已困难。6月9日，“高自联”在人民广场召开的所谓“悼念北京死难同胞追悼会”，事前他们在各校作了七八个小时连续动员，才勉强拼凑到4000人。会后，一群人窜到《解放日报》社门口呼口号、烧报纸，并冲击黄浦区政府，用油漆肆意涂抹区党政机构的招牌，群众称这些人的暴行是最后的蹦跳。
    这里还要指出的是，北京平暴以后，上海与北京的极少数动乱的策划者曾经企图搞动乱“中心南移”，在上海成立所谓“全国高自联”，继续负隅顽抗。6月3日，上海“高自联”头头张才曾到北京找到了北京“高自联”秘书长王有才，密谋“成立全国高校自治联合会”。王有才说：现在“北京‘高自联’一部分人撤了，一部分人失踪了，一部分人躲了，‘北高联’已没有力量搞‘全国高自联’了，还是把‘全国高自联’设在上海。”6月9日，张才返回上海，原来还想大干一番，当他看到形势剧变，发现上海“高自联”也不行了，便想一溜了之，跑到香港去成立所谓“全国高自联”筹委会。6月11日下午，他公然抗拒市政府6月10日发出的关于取缔非法组织上海“高自联”的通告，拒不向公安机关登记，并在某国驻华使、领馆官员的“陪同”下前往虹桥机场，企图逃往香港，被我公安机关当场扣押。6月10日晚上海“高自联”召开常委会，哀叹“鉴于目前时局”，
  “我们要作好长期斗争的准备”，“不要再作无谓的牺牲”。华师大“学生自治会”当晚贴出题为《别了，师大人》的大字报，宣布即日起“自行解散”。6月11日，复旦、同济、华东化工等高校
  “自治会”也纷纷以布告或广播形式，自行宣布“解散”。在这以后几天，上海“高自联”的头头或自首，或转移，或逃窜，至此，上海持续近两个月的学潮至动乱才逐渐平息。
    在平息上海这场动乱中，工人阶级起了决定性的作用。6月8日，朱熔基市长发表关于“稳定大局、稳定上海”的电视讲话以后，当天晚上，10万工人和上海干部、市民一起走上街头，清理路障，6月9日清晨，被阻断了几天的市内交通一举恢复，浦江两岸重又展现出一派和平劳动的景象。上海的动乱之所以能依靠工人阶级而一举得到平息，其决定性因素是北京果断地平息了反革命暴乱，从根本上铲除了制造全国动乱的策源地，端掉了他们的“老窝”，也给上海极少数制造动乱的分子以极大的威慑。北京暴乱的真相，特别是一小撮暴徒疯狂残害人民子弟兵的惨象，给了全市干部、职工以极大的教育。上海在处理学潮和稳定社会的整个过程中，自始至终得到党中央、国务院及时的指示和支持。没有党中央、国务院的正确领导，没有北京的果断行动，上海的动乱是平息不了的，要求得上海局势的稳定也是很难想象的。
    上海动乱已经平息了。这次动乱留给我们的经验教训是多方面的。其中，最主要的恐怕是“5个不能低估”，即：第一，对上海动乱的严重性决不能低估；第二，对上海资产阶级自由化泛滥的严重程度决不能低估；第三，对上海动乱的社会基础决不能低估；第四，对境内外敌对势力在动乱中对上海的种种渗透破坏决不能低估；第五，对赵紫阳淡化党的领导给上海党组织造成的严重思想混乱决不能低估。我们要在党的十三届四中全会和市委第五届八次全会精神指引下，深入开展清查清理工作，除恶务尽，不留后患；同时要认真地总结过去，开拓未来，坚持党的基本路线“一个中心、两个基本点”，为稳定上海、稳定大局、保证我们党和国家的长治久安而继续努力奋斗。
