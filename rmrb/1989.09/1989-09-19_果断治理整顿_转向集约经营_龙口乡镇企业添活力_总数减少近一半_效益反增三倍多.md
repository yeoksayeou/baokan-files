The city of Longkou, located on the Shandong Peninsula, currently has 1,860 township and village enterprises, nearly half the number at its peak of 3,340. However, the economic benefits have increased more than threefold. The township and village enterprises in this city have entered a healthy development track.

Longkou is a newly developed county-level coastal city. In recent years, the development of township and village enterprises has been rapid. However, due to unclear guiding ideologies, a number of enterprises that waste energy and raw materials, severely pollute the environment, and have poor economic benefits were established. After the state implemented macroeconomic controls, these enterprises were the first to be affected and fell into difficulties one after another.

The grim reality forced the municipal Party committee and government to decide to carry out thorough reforms and adjustments. They implemented new changes in guiding ideologies and management strategies: from focusing on increasing production value to focusing on improving economic benefits; from expanding outward to focusing on internal potential; from extensive management to intensive management; from debt-driven operations to self-accumulation. Based on a comprehensive organization of asset verification and investigation, the city decisively implemented "close, stop, merge, transform, sell" for some township and village enterprises. Since last year alone, more than 90 township and village enterprises have been closed, more than 60 have been merged, more than 20 have been auctioned off, and more than 100 ongoing and new construction projects have been delayed or stopped. Some enterprises have also been naturally eliminated in the competition. The city has effectively controlled the outward expansion and reproduction of township and village enterprises.

The principle of "pressure and support" is what Longkou City adheres to during the reforms and adjustments. The funds, raw materials, and energy released after "slimming down" are planned and tilted towards more than 330 township and village enterprises with comprehensive strengths and development prospects, enabling them to better carry out technological transformations, product development, and full-load production. Due to the "five fingers coming together," the city quickly formed four major industrial "punch" sectors: machinery, textiles, chemicals, and building materials, with a total profit accounting for 60% of the city's township and village enterprises. This year, more than 50 new products have been developed, increasing profits by more than 6 million yuan.

The reforms and adjustments have brought new vitality to Longkou City's township and village enterprises. Last year, the total output value reached more than 1.1 billion yuan, with industrial profits and taxes reaching more than 100 million yuan, both more than three times the peak of 1984 when the number of township and village enterprises was the highest, ranking first among the cities, counties, and districts of Yantai City.

    果断治理整顿　转向集约经营
    龙口乡镇企业添活力
　　总数减少近一半  效益反增三倍多
    本报讯　地处山东半岛的龙口市，目前有乡镇企业1860家，比总数最多时的3340家减少了近一半，但经济效益却增长3倍多。这个市的乡镇企业步入健康发展轨道。
    龙口是新兴的县级海滨城市。近几年乡镇企业发展“神速”。但由于开始指导思想不够明确，也盲目上了一批浪费能源、原材料，严重污染环境和经济效益差的企业。国家实行宏观调控后，这部分企业首先受到冲击，相继陷入困境。
    严峻的现实迫使市委、市政府下决心抓好治理整顿。他们从指导思想和经营战略上实行新的转变：从注重产值增长转向注重提高经济效益；从铺摊子、注重扩大外延转为内涵挖潜；从粗放经营为主转为集约经营为主；从负债经营为主转向自我积累为主。全市在集中组织力量清产核资、调查摸底的基础上，对部分乡镇企业果断地实行了“关、停、并、转、卖”。仅从去年以来，就关掉乡镇企业90多处，兼并60多处，拍卖20多处，并缓建、停建了100多个在建、新建项目。也有一些企业在竞争中被自然淘汰。全市乡镇企业外延扩大再生产得到有效控制。
    有“压”有保，这是龙口市在治理整顿中坚持的原则。对“减肥降压”后腾出的资金、原料、能源能等，有计划地向330多处综合素质好、有发展前途的乡镇企业倾斜，使其更好地进行技术改造、产品开发和满负荷生产。由于“五指并拢”，全市迅速形成机械、纺织、化工、建材4大工业“拳头”行业，总利润占全市乡镇企业的60％。今年，已开发新产品50多种，增加利润600多万元。
    治理整顿为龙口市乡镇企业带来新的活力。去年总产值达11亿多元，其中工业利税达1亿多元，均比乡镇企业总数最多的1984年增长3倍多，居烟台市各市、县、区之首。（于广义）
