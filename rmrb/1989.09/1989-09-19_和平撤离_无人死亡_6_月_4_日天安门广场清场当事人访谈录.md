Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 19th

The suppression of the turmoil and the quelling of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing have been over 100 days. The so-called "Tiananmen Massacre" fabricated by Western and Hong Kong news agencies has long been exposed as false. Many people both inside and outside China have begun to understand the truth. However, a few individuals with ulterior motives, especially those who have fled the country like Wu'er Kaixi, continue to spread lies in various forums about "bloodbaths in Tiananmen" and "tanks crushing people into meat patties" to mislead the public. "Voice of America" also frequently quotes these individuals, using supposedly "objective" methods to continue spreading these lies and inciting anti-China sentiment.

Recently, reporters visited some participants in the clearance of Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4th, including officers from the martial law troops who carried out the clearance, representatives who negotiated the peaceful evacuation, doctors who provided on-site medical assistance, and students who were the last to leave Tiananmen Square. They used their personal experiences and eyewitness accounts to demonstrate that during the entire process of clearing Tiananmen Square, the martial law troops took appropriate measures to avoid bloodshed, achieved a peaceful evacuation, and did not kill or crush anyone. They once again refuted the lies of Wu'er Kaixi and his ilk with ironclad facts.

**Responding to the government's call, agreeing to peaceful evacuation**

Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, and others said: Taking responsibility for history, the military did not kill anyone on the square

Since the afternoon of June 2nd, Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, Liu Xiaobo, and Gao Xin, who participated in the limited-term hunger strike in Tiananmen Square, responded to the call of the People's Government and the martial law troops in the early hours of June 4th to find the advancing martial law troops and negotiate a peaceful evacuation. They also left Tiananmen Square with the student crowd, witnessing the entire clearance process. Recently, they detailed the clearance process in separate interviews with reporters.

The reporter interviewed Hou Dejian at his Beijing residence. This composer, who left Tiananmen Square on June 4th, hid in a foreign embassy in China for two months. During this period, there were many rumors about his safety and whereabouts overseas. Hou Dejian, sitting in front of the reporter, talked about the situation in Tiananmen Square when it was cleared: "Throughout the process, I did not see anyone being beaten to death, regardless of whether they were students, civilians, or soldiers."

He said, "I also did not see tanks or armored vehicles crushing into the crowd. I saw three or four tanks parked outside the square. However, I heard gunshots, and I also saw gunshots. This was when the students had already started to evacuate. There were about a dozen fully armed soldiers rushing over, shooting at the high-powered loudspeakers of 'High Autonomy Federation' at the corner of the Monument to the People's Heroes. Before that, I also saw tracer bullets flying from west to east on Chang'an Street, but they were very high. I also saw tear gas being fired at the southwest corner of the square, not much. When the troops ordered us to evacuate, there seemed to be gunshots as well. The few I saw were all shots fired into the air."

Hou Dejian said that during his stay in a foreign embassy in China, he wrote an article titled "My Personal Experience During the Evacuation from Tiananmen Square" on June 12th, documenting what he saw and heard during the clearance. He said, "My friends thought the content differed greatly from what they had heard. But I said, what I saw was exactly like that."

Hou Dejian recalled that around 3 a.m. on June 4th, the atmosphere on the square was very tense, with many students near the Monument to the People's Heroes unwilling to leave. "I, Liu Xiaobo, Zhou Dao, and Gao Xin were there. We four thought about it and felt that we should evacuate, so we started doing this work." "Because at that time, many people, including us four who were over 30, were not calm. Two doctors from the Red Cross were very calm and suggested that we might as well go talk to the martial law troops, trying to get some time so that we and the students could evacuate peacefully."

When Hou Dejian talked about the situation where he and Zhou Dao, accompanied by two Red Cross doctors, negotiated with the martial law troops, he said: "It was already 3:30. The two of us and the two doctors, on the west side of the Monument to the People's Heroes, blocked an ambulance heading north. Several security guards who were protecting us also got on the car. We had just reached the northeast corner of the square when we saw many troops on Chang'an Street. The ambulance stopped immediately. We quickly got off the car and ran towards the troops, immediately triggering a series of clicks of bullets being loaded. The doctors quickly identified themselves and introduced me as Hou Dejian, hoping to speak with the commanding officer. The excited soldiers calmed down a bit, and we could hear them discussing my name, although it was not very clear, but it felt without hostility. The commanding officer was not far from us. After hearing our intentions, he and four or five soldiers walked over together. He looked very normal, like a 40-something, sturdy but slightly overweight, high-ranking military officer with three stars. When he shook hands with us, he was very calm and not at all impatient. I felt he seriously listened to our request. At the beginning, he sternly asked us to stop the hunger strike first. I and Zhou Dao replied that we had already stopped the hunger strike. Afterwards, his attitude was always very gentle, indicating that he needed to report to headquarters. We four stood in the open northeast corner of the square, very conspicuous, still the doctors were more composed, telling everyone to stand still and not move, and raising their hands high to shout for them to hurry up. A few minutes later, the commanding officer came back and told us that headquarters had agreed to our request, and the safest evacuation direction was the southeast exit. When we asked, he told us that he was the political commissar of the troops, surnamed Ji, and I don't remember the unit number. We needed these materials to persuade the students. During the negotiation, I remember that Political Commissar Ji had said that if you successfully persuade everyone to evacuate the square, you will have done a great deed. I personally think that his words were sincere, without any other implications."

"With the guarantee, we ran back to the Monument to the People's Heroes, picked up the microphone, and shouted, roughly saying that without the consent of everyone, I took the initiative to find the troops to negotiate."

"Although our minds were not very clear, we still tried our best to persuade everyone. I felt the work was not easy to do, so I wanted to go back and negotiate with the troops to get more time. So, I and Zhou Dao, along with the two Red Cross doctors, went towards the north side of the square again. We hadn't even reached the middle of the square when we encountered the political commissar of the martial law troops. At this time, the troops had already started to concentrate on the Monument to the People's Heroes. The result was simple: the troops' command time had arrived, and they had to act. I quickly ran back, vaguely hearing the students near the Monument to the People's Heroes shouting whether to evacuate or not, I didn't know which voice was louder. Anyway, I was in a daze at the time and couldn't care about so much. I saw students sitting on the ground and went over to pull them up. At this time, some students had already started to slowly evacuate towards the southeast corner of the square. I don't know how long the entire evacuation process took."

Hou Dejian said, "Due to fasting for two days and two nights and running around, I felt a bit weak. The students helped me to the Red Cross emergency station next to the Museum of Chinese History on the east side of the square. At this time, I heard them say that the students had left the Monument to the People's Heroes, passed the Monument to the People's Heroes, and walked to the front gate. I, along with doctors and about 100 wounded, were the last to leave the square."

Zhou Dao and Gao Xin's talks both started with refuting Wu'er Kaixi and his ilk's propaganda overseas about "Tiananmen Square blood flowing like a river." They both mentioned: Wu'er Kaixi was not present at the scene of the clearance in Tiananmen Square and had no right to comment on the clearance issue. Zhou Dao said, "I saw Wu'er Kaixi on the square around 12 a.m. on June 3rd, and then I didn't see him again. I heard that one or two hours later, his angina pectoris attacked, and he was carried away by his classmates. Obviously, he did not experience the clearance process at that time, and I am a witness to the clearance. I am responsible for the facts and history. What I say is the truth, and Wu'er Kaixi has no right to comment on the clearance issue in Tiananmen Square. What he said about Tiananmen Square being a river of blood is pure rumor." When Zhou Dao talked about his own experience in the clearance process, he said, "In short, I did not see anyone being beaten to death or crushed to death, it really did not happen." After introducing the process of negotiating with the martial law troops' officer for peaceful evacuation with Hou Dejian, he said, "During the evacuation, some students were cursing the PLA while evacuating, but the PLA was still very restrained and did not open fire. At the beginning of the evacuation, due to the crowd, it was very slow. When we were about to leave the Monument to the People's Heroes, I saw a few armored vehicles stop very close to the end of the student queue. I still remember clearly that a soldier opened the top cover of the armored vehicle, stuck out half of his body, and made a gesture, indicating that the students should hurry up. It was probably around 5 a.m., and it was almost dawn. Finally, we left the square from the southeast corner and then walked to the Six Departments, from the Music Hall to Xidan, and the queue slowly dispersed."

Gao Xin said, "I can say that I am basically clear about the entire process of clearing Tiananmen Square. I saw Wu'er Kaixi on the square around 2 a.m. on June 4th. At that time, he shouted a few words on the Monument to the People's Heroes and then fainted, and then someone carried him away. I did not see Wu'er Kaixi again during the entire clearance process. I participated in the hunger strike, which was a matter of understanding, but as a person, one should first respect the facts. I absolutely do not hide the facts, nor do I fabricate them."

He continued, "In the afternoon of June 3rd, I took the opportunity to go to the toilet and saw several thousand troops on the west side of the Monument to the People's Heroes. The discipline was very good, sitting on the ground waiting for orders. There were crowds in front of Tiananmen Gate surrounding the troops. The troops had no guns, nor did they have any other weapons like sticks. I came back and told the other three comrades that the news coming from outside was not true, and I saw that the troops' discipline was very good. By around midnight, we heard sporadic gunshots around the square and the government's broadcast. Due to the noise, it was not very clear, but we vaguely heard that a serious counter-revolutionary riot had occurred in Beijing. At this time, some students were very excited, and some still had sticks in their hands. We four saw the situation on the square and felt that we must persist in the peaceful stance, so we mobilized everyone to put away the sticks. Later, we also found a machine gun and a submachine gun on the Monument to the People's Heroes. Through repeated mobilization, they put away the guns. Afterwards, we four discussed again, and Hou Dejian and Zhou Dao went to contact the troops, hoping that the troops could open a path. I and Liu Xiaobo continued to stay on the steps of the Monument to the People's Heroes. Hou Dejian and Zhou Dao came back and conveyed the opinions of the troops' leaders, and many students began to evacuate towards the southeast corner of the square. At this time, some soldiers came over, and there was also a commanding officer. They used guns to silence the loudspeakers, but they never opened fire on the crowd from beginning to end. This is what I saw very clearly. At this time, tanks also gradually came from north to south, with the leading tank only about 20 meters away from us. When we walked to the area of the Arrow Tower in front of the gate, I was already the last one in the evacuating university student queue, so I, as a witness, saw the entire process and scene of evacuating from the Monument to the People's Heroes to the south very clearly."

Gao Xin said, "During the students' evacuation, I did not see the military firing at the crowd. If they had fired at the crowd, I think the first to be injured and killed should have been me, as I was at the end of the queue. No one died during the clearance, this can be confirmed. No matter how 'High Autonomy Federation' leaders 'propagandize' overseas, saying that thousands or tens of thousands of people died on the square, like Xiao Bin on TV, it is absolutely a lie. From the perspective of a person's character, I can say that what I say is all the truth, without exaggeration."

Liu Xiaobo, a lecturer in the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, said that I must take responsibility for history, so it is necessary to recount the facts I saw at that time. Around 2 a.m. on June 4th, I heard from the "High Autonomy Federation" broadcast that the leader Wu'er Kaixi said he would share the fate of Tiananmen Square and fight to the last person. Just as he said this, he started to breathe heavily, probably because his angina pectoris attacked again. After that, I did not see him or hear his voice again. At that time, the stretcher on which Wu'er Kaixi was lying was on the east side of our hunger strike tent. After we left the tent, we found that the stretcher was gone. At that time, I discussed with Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, and Gao Xin, and Hou Dejian and Zhou Dao went to negotiate with the troops. We also asked "High Autonomy Federation" to send two student representatives, but this was opposed by Cai Ling.

When talking about the evacuation situation, he said, "I did not see the troops firing at the crowd. They fired into the air or at the loudspeakers. I also did not see anyone dying. I definitely did not see Tiananmen Square with blood flowing like a river."

**Doctors at the square's aid station, Song Song and Wang Haiyan, said:**

**The rescue process did not see the troops killing anyone**

Song Song, a surgeon from Beijing Union Hospital, who participated in the negotiation with the martial law troops in the early hours of June 4th, recalled the situation at that time and said to the reporter, "On the afternoon and evening of June 3rd, I was on duty at the square as assigned by the hospital. Because I did not wear a watch at that time, I could only estimate the time. Around 1 a.m., I heard the government's broadcast asking students to leave the square. At that time, I was treating a few students who were injured by glass on the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes. At this time, I saw that vehicles on the north side of the square were on fire, and I also heard gunshots from the direction of Chang'an Street. At this time, the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast station had words like 'fight to the end.' Students were passing on a message, saying that someone had been shot dead. Many students were very excited and not calm. At that time, I felt that as a doctor, I should do some work to let the students evacuate according to the government's requirements. But considering that my personal influence was not great, it was not certain that my suggestion would be effective at 'High Autonomy Federation.' I thought of Hou Dejian and others who were older and had more social experience, they might be calmer. At the same time, they had some fame among the students and might have some influence. I did not know Hou and the others, but because I was sent by the Red Cross around 10 p.m. on June 3rd to deliver water to the Monument to the People's Heroes, I knew where they were fasting, so I decided to try. Around 2 or 3 a.m., I went up to the highest layer of the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes and found them. I proposed to Hou Dejian and others as a doctor that they should let the students evacuate, and it would be bad if there was danger. Hou Dejian and others talked about having the same idea, but they were not members of 'High Autonomy Federation' and might not be able to do it. I suggested again whether we could talk to the PLA directly. Hou Dejian and others agreed and said they hoped I would go with them, as it would be better to have a doctor present. After careful consideration, I agreed. I came down from the Monument to the People's Heroes to stop a car. There were few cars on the square at that time, and it was not easy to find a small van on the west side of the square. I told the driver to help take Hou Dejian to where the PLA was, and he said it was easy, so he took me, Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, and a person in a white coat who was originally in the car to the northeast side of the square. At this time, I saw that Chang'an Street was full of PLA. I, Hou, Zhou, and the person in a white coat who was originally in the car got off the car, raised our hands, and walked towards the PLA. A few soldiers asked us what we were doing, and Hou Dejian said, 'I represent the four of us who are fasting, and I want to negotiate with the PLA to help students evacuate peacefully.' After waiting for a few minutes, a political commissar surnamed Ji came back and told us that after reporting to the martial law troops' headquarters, our suggestion was agreed to. After returning to the Monument to the People's Heroes, Hou Dejian and others broadcasted to the students to evacuate the square. The students' emotions gradually calmed down, and some responded. Around 4:15 a.m., smoke was seen again in the southwest corner of the square, and gunshots were heard (tear gas was fired). Students began to get restless again. Due to concerns that the students' emotions would be unstable during the evacuation, Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, and I went down from the Monument to the People's Heroes to find the PLA again. We encountered Political Commissar Ji in the southeast corner of the square. Just as we saw him, the lights on the square were all turned off. Hou Dejian asked Political Commissar Ji if more time could be given to the students to evacuate peacefully. Political Commissar Ji looked at his watch and said, 'The time for clearing the square is almost up and cannot be changed. If you have no effect on the students, you should evacuate quickly.' We immediately ran back to the Monument to the People's Heroes, but when I reached the second layer of the Monument to the People's Heroes, the PLA had already come up to the highest layer of the Monument to the People's Heroes from another direction and silenced the loudspeakers on the Monument to the People's Heroes. We quickly went to the east and north sides of the Monument to the People's Heroes and organized the students to evacuate in an orderly manner towards the southeast of the square. During the evacuation process, I did not see any dead bodies, did not see the PLA firing at the crowd, and did not see any direct conflict between the students and the PLA."

Several doctors from Beijing Medical University's First Hospital, who were on duty in Tiananmen Square on the night of June 3rd as ordered by the Red Cross, talked to the reporter about similar situations. Vice President Wang Haiyan of the First Hospital of Beijing Medical University said, "We set up an aid station in the northeast corner of the Monument to the People's Heroes, near the road, on May 18th as ordered by the Red Cross, and repeatedly received orders from the Red Cross not to withdraw. On the night of June 3rd, we had seven or eight key personnel participating in the rescue team, on duty at the square. Around midnight on June 4th, before the lights went out, various hospitals' medical points withdrew from the square to the west side of the Museum of Chinese History one after another. I was busy all day and was really tired, so I dozed off. I vaguely heard a hoarse voice on the broadcast, and I understood that it meant to withdraw from the square. Later, someone told me that the speaker was Hou Dejian. I quickly got up and heard the "International" being sung on the square, and saw the flags moving southward. I asked the medical students who were helping with the rescue if they wanted to withdraw with everyone. Before I finished speaking, two bursts of gunfire, the loudspeakers on the Monument to the People's Heroes that were still ringing went silent. Tanks in front of the Golden Water Bridge slowly moved towards the square. As far as I could see, there was no one crushed. Some soldiers in camouflage uniforms and carrying submachine guns came to our side, only about 1 meter away. I told the soldiers, 'We are medical personnel sent by the Red Cross.' A soldier carrying a camera ordered the soldiers to retreat, and the soldiers retreated to about 3 meters away. I immediately went up to thank him and shook hands with him. At this time, a 40- or 50-year-old soldier with only a steel helmet and no insignia on his cap came over. I told him that we were all medical personnel here, and there were also wounded, hoping that the army could escort us out. Soon, six soldiers in a row from the PLA came to escort us. We sent two wounded soldiers back and carried the non-military wounded on stretchers, four people in a row, towards the southeast of the square. At this time, it was already dawn, and we did not see anyone killed or crushed on the way. We had just walked to the first alley south of the Museum of Chinese History when we heard gunshots from the small yellow building by the road. The PLA protecting us leaned against the wall and trees to set up guns and fired back. We were within the firing range, and I ordered everyone to squat down, turn around, and return to the west side of the Museum of Chinese History. After the gunshots stopped, we, the last non-military personnel to leave the square, left the square from the southeast corner where the tanks had opened a path."

Mountain Jianzhi, a urology surgeon who was also on duty for rescue that night, added, "That night, injured people were constantly sent in. These injured people were generally blunt trauma injuries, some had sprained ankles, or had cuts on their hands. Among them, there were students and also PLA soldiers. The most serious injury I treated was a humerus fracture. A soldier was lying on the ground, and I bent down to treat him. A bottle of soda flew past my face, almost hitting my head. At that time, the atmosphere in our circle was very harmonious. We gave the injured water and biscuits. An injured person wanted water, and the PLA gave him their water bottle."

**The last to leave the square, Tsinghua University student Zhu Ming, said: The military did not fire at the students and the crowd**

During the clearance of Tiananmen Square, a group of students from Tsinghua University on the square were the last to leave, and they talked about the situation on that day as participants. Engineering Physics Department graduate student Zhu Ming told the reporter, "I arrived at Tiananmen Square around 8 p.m. on June 3rd. Around 10 p.m., I heard from the 'High Autonomy Federation' loudspeaker that the troops might enter Tiananmen Square between 0:00 and 1:00 on June 4th. I wanted to see how the troops would treat the students and the crowd who stayed in Tiananmen Square, so I stayed. Around 12:10 a.m. on June 4th, I saw an armored vehicle enter Tiananmen Square from the front gate, and some people chased after it with sticks. Around 0:51 a.m. on June 4th, a large number of troops entered from the east side of the front gate and gathered on the east side of the Monument to the People's Heroes. Around 1:30 a.m., more troops came from the west side of Chang'an Street. At this time, I was standing near the flagpole and saw some people throwing bricks and soda bottles at the troops. After a while, I went to the front gate, and the troops came over, so I went back to the east side of the Monument to the People's Heroes. I saw many soldiers coming out of the east gate of the Great Hall of the People, surrounding the Monument to the People's Heroes. The 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast said that Hou Dejian and others had contacted a regimental political commissar of the troops, and the troops agreed to the peaceful evacuation of students and the crowd. However, some students did not agree to evacuate. At this time, I was standing on the east side railing of the Monument to the People's Heroes and saw about a dozen soldiers coming over. They crossed the student gathering area from the east and went to the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes, standing in a row, indicating that the students should make way, and then went up the steps. A military officer-like person held an automatic rifle and fired at the loudspeakers set up by 'High Autonomy Federation' on the Monument to the People's Heroes. A few soldiers came to the southeast corner of the third layer of the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast station and tore down the tent. After a while, I followed the retreating student crowd towards the southeast corner of the square. As I was walking, I looked back and saw a soldier using an automatic rifle to fire at another loudspeaker of the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast station. At this time, some students cursed the soldiers, but the soldiers did not fire at them. I left Tiananmen Square around 5 a.m."

Dai Donghai, a student from the Thermal Energy Department, said, "I arrived at Tiananmen Square around 11 p.m. on June 3rd. After midnight, I heard a rumbling sound, and then an armored vehicle came from the front gate along the side of the Museum of Chinese History. At this time, some people pushed the fence of Tiananmen Square onto the road to make a barricade. I saw an armored vehicle on fire near the east viewing platform. After a while, I saw some people helping a soldier run towards the aid station near the Museum of Chinese History, with people chasing behind them with sticks. Later, I went to the second layer of steps of the Monument to the People's Heroes. The 'High Autonomy Federation' command issued masks and soda water to everyone, saying it was to prevent tear gas. I heard someone in the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast advocating taking up weapons to defend themselves and saying that they had seized more than a dozen guns. But this was opposed by some people. Around 4 a.m. on June 4th, the lights on the square suddenly went out, and after a while, the lights came back on. Later, I followed the retreating crowd out from the southeast corner and did not see any injured students or crowd around. I returned to the school around 9 a.m."

Liu Wei, a student from the Chemical Engineering Department, said, "I came to Tiananmen Square around 10 a.m. on June 3rd. In the evening, I heard the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast station and the government's broadcast station both broadcasting, and the government's broadcast station broadcasted that the square would be cleared that night. Around 3 a.m. on June 4th, according to the requirements proposed by the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast station, we all gathered around the Monument to the People's Heroes. I stayed on the east side. Around 4 a.m., I heard Hou Dejian, Liu Xiaobo, and others in the 'High Autonomy Federation' broadcast seeking everyone's opinions, whether to evacuate or persist. The voices calling for evacuation were slightly louder than those calling for persistence, and it was finally decided to evacuate. I saw the troops demolishing the 'High Autonomy Federation' command when they fired warning shots into the air. When we evacuated, there was definitely no one in the tents on the square, because at that time, there was such a big noise and it lasted for so long, who would still stay in the tents?"

Zhao Ming, a former member of the illegal organization "Preparatory Committee" at Tsinghua University and a student from the Engineering Physics Department, told the reporter, "During the retreat, I and some security guards were responsible for checking if there were any students in the tents south of the Monument to the People's Heroes. The result was that there was not a single student."

**Martial law troops' officers Ji Xinguo and Gu Benxi said:**

**Students evacuated peacefully, no deaths**

Ji Xinguo, a colonel and political commissar of a certain regiment of the Beijing troops, and Gu Benxi, a lieutenant colonel and officer of a certain unit, led the troops to participate in the entire process of clearing Tiananmen Square in the early hours of June 4th and were the martial law troops' representatives who negotiated with Hou Dejian. When introducing the clearance process in the early hours of June 4th to the reporter, they said:

Around 1:30 a.m. on June 4th, the first batch of martial law troops arrived at the south side of Tiananmen Square, near the Golden Water Bridge, and gathered. Various troops also arrived at the designated positions around the square. From this time on, the high-powered loudspeakers on the roof of the Great Hall of the People continuously broadcasted emergency announcements from the Beijing Municipal Government and the martial law troops' headquarters, pointing out: A serious counter-revolutionary riot had occurred in the capital. All citizens and students in Tiananmen Square should leave immediately to ensure that the martial law troops could carry out their mission.

Around 3:30 a.m., an ambulance drove from the south side of the square to the north and stopped near the north side of the Museum of Chinese History. Four people got off the car, two of whom were doctors from the Red Cross wearing white coats. At that time, there were no pedestrians in this area, and their appearance was particularly noticeable. They anxiously raised their hands and walked towards the troops. An officer from the martial law troops waved his hand and shouted, "Stop!" and sent a few people to inquire. One of them introduced himself, "I am Hou Dejian. We request to see the commanding officer of the troops to negotiate the evacuation of students and the crowd on the square."

The officer in charge of the regiment thought this was a good opportunity to do more work with the students and let them evacuate the square as soon as possible, so he said, "Please wait a moment, we will reply to you immediately."

This situation was immediately reported to the superior officers. Gu Benxi, a lieutenant colonel who followed the troops, ran to the front of the Golden Water Bridge and reported to the highest commander on the scene about Hou Dejian's request to negotiate. The commander on the scene immediately replied, "It can be discussed. Tell them that they must evacuate Tiananmen Square and leave from the southeast direction of the square, the faster the better!"

Thus, Colonel Ji Xinguo, Lieutenant Colonel Gu Benxi, the political department head Wang Jian, a security officer, and two guards went to Hou Dejian and his party. After shaking hands, they introduced their identities to each other. Besides Hou Dejian, there was also Zhou Dao from the Four Communications Company. Ji Xinguo and Gu Benxi first said, "You are fasting again, which has had a bad effect on the students continuing to stay on the square."

"We have already stopped fasting," Hou Dejian and Zhou Dao replied.

"Stopping fasting is wise," Ji and Gu continued, "Next, Hou Dejian reflected, 'The situation near the Monument to the People's Heroes is very chaotic. Some students want to evacuate, but they are worried about being surrounded by the military and fear that the military will use force. Can we have some time to do some work for the students?'"

Ji Xinguo and Gu Benxi immediately expressed, "The Party, the government, and the martial law troops do not want to see bloodshed. We have repeatedly stated that martial law is not to suppress students and the crowd. Now a counter-revolutionary riot has occurred, and to ensure that the troops do not mistakenly injure students and the crowd during the execution of the mission, the only way is for all students and others on the square to evacuate unconditionally." They pointed out that Hou Dejian's initiative to do work with the students was welcome. If Hou Dejian could persuade and mobilize the students to respond to the government's call and leave the square as soon as possible, you would have done a great deed.

Hou Dejian was very happy and repeatedly said, "Good, good! I will definitely go back and do the work." He then asked, "From which direction should we evacuate?" Ji and Gu told him, "From the southeast direction of the square, the troops have left a passage there."

When parting, Hou Dejian specially asked for the name and unit number of Political Commissar Ji, saying that he would go back and do work with the students. Ji Xinguo truthfully told his name, position, and unit number. Finally, they agreed that they would meet again to negotiate after they talked to the students.

After Hou Dejian and the other three left, Ji Xinguo and Gu Benxi ran to the Golden Water Bridge and reported to the commander on the scene. The commanders listened and said, "Good! This is exactly what we want to do, to mobilize them to evacuate."

Around 4:20 a.m., Ji Xinguo, Gu Benxi, and a few guards walked towards the south side of the square. At this time, the square seemed very empty. When they were about a hundred meters away from the Monument to the People's Heroes, they heard Hou Dejian's hoarse voice from the loudspeakers on the Monument to the People's Heroes, persuading the students to evacuate Tiananmen Square. He said that after negotiating with the troops, it was agreed to leave a passage for the students to evacuate in the southeast corner of the square. Ji and Gu pointed out that it should be said that even if Hou Dejian and others had not come to negotiate, the martial law troops had already prepared this passage in advance, and this was the original deployment for the clearance.

After a while, Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, and the two Red Cross doctors walked towards the north. When they met, Ji and Gu asked them about the situation of their work?

Hou replied, "The students' emotions have not cooled down yet. Some agree to evacuate, some still insist on staying, and some even curse Hou Dejian. Hou said that he hoped to have more time to do the work."

Ji and Gu said, "We have given quite a bit of time. We hope you hurry up with the work. If you can't do it, we hope you evacuate the square quickly. We will guarantee your safety."

During this conversation, Hou Dejian also said that the students were worried that the troops were not sincere and would open fire. Lieutenant Colonel Gu immediately refuted, "How can we not be sincere! Listen to the broadcast!" At this time, the high-powered loudspeakers on the roof of the Great Hall of the People were broadcasting, "The martial law troops' headquarters agrees to the students' appeal to evacuate from the southeast direction as soon as possible." Gu said, "This shows that the martial law troops' headquarters has responded." Hou Dejian looked happy, "Is that so! I hope to broadcast it a few more times, so we can do better work with the students." Because the clearance was imminent, Ji and Gu repeatedly urged them to evacuate quickly, time was running out. If there were still people who did not want to evacuate, you should also evacuate the square quickly.

After Hou Dejian and the others returned, the high-powered loudspeakers on the roof of the Great Hall of the People stopped broadcasting for a while to avoid noise interference and facilitate Hou Dejian and the others to do work with the students.

During the interview, Ji Xinguo and Gu Benxi pointed out that when the martial law troops' deployment for clearing the square was already in place, Hou Dejian, Zhou Dao, and others came to negotiate, and the troops immediately agreed. They welcomed their work to mobilize the students to evacuate and pointed out the evacuation route from the southeast direction. When the martial law troops' headquarters received the report about Hou Dejian and others coming to negotiate, they immediately responded and agreed to the students' appeal to evacuate in the broadcast. To facilitate their work with better sound effects, the high-powered loudspeakers on the roof of the Great Hall of the People also stopped broadcasting for a while. This shows that the martial law troops seriously implemented the policies of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, not only the overall deployment was appropriate, but also the details were considered very carefully.

Around 4:10 a.m., the lights on the square went out. Some people spread rumors that this was to facilitate the troops' suppression. Regarding this, Political Commissar Ji and Lieutenant Colonel Gu said, "This is pure nonsense, it is malicious." They told the reporter that turning off and on the lights were both signals for the clearance that day. Turning off the lights was a signal to notify the martial law troops to prepare for the clearance, to let each unit be ready. At 4:30 a.m., the lights on the square came on, which was the signal to start the clearance, to facilitate coordinated and unified actions.

During the clearance process, Gu Benxi was with the troops advancing from north to south. He saw the students around the Monument to the People's Heroes queuing up, holding flags, and evacuating from the passage left by the troops in the southeast direction. The order was maintained by the student security guards outside the queue, and the front part walked relatively neatly.

Ji Xinguo and Gu Benxi solemnly said that throughout the clearance process, except for a few shots fired by the soldiers at the loudspeakers of the "High Autonomy Federation" hung on the Monument to the People's Heroes, no shots were fired at the crowd, and no one was killed during the entire clearance process.

Political Commissar Ji said that during the clearance, the soldiers held sticks and advanced, but maintained a certain distance from the evacuating student queue. The student queue started to evacuate before the troops arrived, and the troops advanced, they accelerated the evacuation speed. Finally, a few students on the north side of the Monument to the People's Heroes did not want to evacuate, and the troops had to drive them out by force.

Gu Benxi talked about how before the armored vehicles came, the soldiers had already checked each tent as required by the martial law troops' headquarters to see if there was anyone inside. He personally checked some tents and saw a soldier in a tent pulling out a man in his thirties who was lame and gave him a stick to leave quickly. In another tent, a female student was frightened and fainted, and the soldiers carried her out. Because each tent was carefully checked, there was definitely no one inside when the armored vehicles came.

Political Commissar Ji and Lieutenant Colonel Gu pointed out that in the clearance of Tiananmen Square, it was possible to achieve "peaceful evacuation" because of the correct decisions made by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and the correct implementation of policies by the martial law troops. They said that when the troops were about to clear the square and approach the Monument to the People's Heroes, some students lacked reason and still shouted reactionary slogans, cursed the troops, and even threw stones and soda bottles at the soldiers. If the troops had not taken a restrained attitude and required the soldiers to strictly execute the orders, it would have been difficult to avoid bloodshed and deaths.

    和平撤离　无人死亡
  ——6月4日天安门广场清场当事人访谈录
  新华社记者　邱永生　黄智敏　易俭如　张宝瑞　朱　玉
    制止动乱、平息北京反革命暴乱已经过去了100多天。西方和台港新闻机构曾经在海内外大肆散布的所谓“天安门血案”的谣言，早已为事实所戳穿。海内外广大人士已经开始明白了事实真相。但是，还有少数别有用心的人、尤其是叛国外逃的吾尔开希等人，依然在不同场合侈谈什么“血洗天安门”、“坦克把人压成肉饼”等一类谎言，以蛊惑人心。“美国之音”也不时引用这伙人的话，以所谓“客观”的手法继续散布这类谎言，煽动反华情绪。
    记者最近分别走访了6月4日凌晨天安门广场清场的一些当事人，其中有执行清场任务的戒严部队军官，交涉和平撤离的代表、现场救护的医生和最后撤出天安门广场的学生。他们用亲身经历、亲眼所见的事实说明，戒严部队在天安门广场清场的整个过程中，采取妥善措施，避免了流血冲突，实现了和平撤离，没有打死、轧死一个人，再一次以铁的事实批驳了吾尔开希之流的谎言。
        响应政府号召、同意和平撤离的
    侯德健、周舵等人说：对历史负责，
    军队没有在广场打死人
    从6月2日下午起在天安门广场参加有限期“绝食”的侯德健、周舵、刘晓波、高新等4人，4日凌晨响应人民政府和戒严部队的号召，设法找到挺进广场的戒严部队交涉和平撤离，并且最后随学生队伍撤出天安门广场，目睹了清场的全过程。近日，他们在分别接受记者采访时，详细讲述了清场的经过。
    记者是在侯德健的北京寓所采访他的。这位作曲家从6月4日撤离天安门广场后便躲进某国驻华机构达两个月。在此期间，海外对他的安危去向众说纷纭。坐在记者面前的侯德健，谈起天安门广场清场情况时说：“在整个过程中，我没有看到有人被打死，不管是谁，学生、市民或军人。”
    他说：“我也没有看到坦克或装甲车轧向人群。我见到有三四辆坦克停在广场外边。但是，我听到打枪，我也亲眼看到打枪。那是在同学已经开始撤离的时候。大概有十几个全副武装的军人冲过来，枪是对着纪念碑角上‘高自联’的高音喇叭打的。在这之前，我还看到在长安街上，由西向东有枪弹划过的光线，但是很高。我也看到朝广场西南角施放的催泪弹，不是很多。部队让我们撤离的时候好像也有放枪的声音，我看到的几个都是朝天放的。”
    侯德健说，他藏身某国驻华机构期间，曾于6月12日写过一篇题为《撤离天安门广场时我的亲身经过》的文章，记述了清场时他的所见所闻。他说：“我的朋友看到这份东西后认为和他们听到的情况差别很大。但是我说，我所看到的，就是这样子。”
    侯德健回忆说，6月4日清晨3时左右，广场气氛很紧张，纪念碑附近有很多学生不愿走。“我、刘晓波、周舵和高新在那里，我们4个人想了想，觉得应该撤，就开始做这个工作。”“因为当时很多人，包括我们4个30多岁的人在内都不冷静。有两个红十字会的医生倒很冷静，建议我们不妨去找戒严部队谈一谈，争取能够给一点时间，使我们这些人和同学能够和平撤离。”
    侯德健在谈到他和周舵由两个红十字会医生陪同与戒严部队交涉的情况时说：“当时已是3点半了，我们两人和两位医生，在纪念碑西侧，现挡住了一辆急救车，往广场北面开去。有几个保卫我们的纠察队员也上了车。才到广场的东北角，我们就看见长安街有很多部队，急救车立刻停住了。我们急忙下车往部队跑去，当即引起了一阵叽叽咔咔的子弹上膛声。医生急忙表明身份，并介绍我是侯德健，希望能与指挥官说话。激动的士兵稍稍缓和，也听得见议论我的名字的声音，虽听不大清楚，但感觉并无敌意。指挥官离我们不很远，听清我们的来意后与四五个军人一齐走过来。他看起来很正常，就像平日常见的那种40多岁、很结实而略显发福的三颗星的高级军官。他与我们握手的时候，显得很平静，一点也不急躁。我觉得他认真地听了我们的请求，刚开始时他有点严肃地要求我们先停止绝食。我和周舵回答，我们已经停止绝食了。之后，他的态度一直很温和，表示需要请示总部。我们4个人站在空旷的广场东北角，极为突出，还是医生比较镇定，让大家站着别动，并把双手举起来高声喊叫请他们快一点。几分钟后，指挥官又来了，告诉我们总部已同意我们的请求，最安全的撤退方向是东南口。在我们询问下，他告诉我们他是部队的政委，姓季，番号我记不得了。我们需要这些材料去说服同学。在交涉中，我记得季政委还曾经说过，如果你们成功地说服大家撤离广场，你们就立了一功。我个人认为他这句话是真诚的，没有什么其他含义。”
      “有了保证，我们飞也似地跑回纪念碑，拿起话筒便喊，大意是在未经大家同意的情况下，我擅自作主，找到部队与之交涉。”
    “尽管我们的脑子已不太好使，但我们仍然尽可能地去说服大家。我觉得工作不太好做，就想再回去和部队交涉争取点时间。于是我和周舵及两位红十字会的医生就再次向广场的北面走去。还没有走到广场中间，就碰到了戒严部队的那个政委。这时部队已经开始向纪念碑集中了。结果很简单，部队命令的时间已到，他们必须行动了。这时我赶快跑回去，远远地听到纪念碑附近的学生在喊撤还是不撤，声音到底哪个大我也不知道。反正我当时迷迷糊糊的，也管不了那么多了，看到坐在地上的学生就过去把他们拉起来。当时已经有部分同学开始慢慢地往广场东南角撤离了。整个撤出过程我也不知道到底有多长时间。”
    侯德健说：“由于饿了两天两夜，又到处乱跑，感觉有点虚脱。学生们就把我扶到广场东面历史博物馆旁边的红十字会急救站。这时我听他们说学生已经离开纪念碑，过了纪念堂，走到前门了。我和医生、伤员等100多人是最后离开广场的。”
    周舵和高新的谈话都是从批驳吾尔开希之流在国外鼓噪
  “天安门广场血流成河”的谎言开始的。他们不约而同地谈到：天安门广场清场时，吾尔开希根本不在现场，他根本没有资格谈清场问题。周舵说：“我6月3日晚上12时前后在广场上见过吾尔开希一面之后，就没有再看见他了。听说一、两个钟头后他的心肌炎犯了，被同学们抬离了广场。可见他是没有经历过当时清场过程的，而我是清场的目睹者、见证人，我对事实负责、对历史负责。我讲的是事实，而吾尔开希是没有资格评论天安门广场清场问题的，他讲的天安门广场血流成河纯属谣言。”周舵谈到他自己经历的清场过程时说：“反正我没有看见任何打死轧死人的事，确实没有。”他在介绍了同侯德健一起同戒严部队军官交涉和平撤离的经过后说：“在撤离过程中，有的同学一边撤，一边回过身子骂解放军，但解放军还是很克制，没有开枪。开始撤的时候，由于人多拥挤，走得很慢。等快离开纪念碑的时候，我看见几辆装甲车在离学生队伍末尾很近的地方停下来。我还记得很清楚，有一个战士打开装甲车的顶盖，探出半个身子，作了一个动作，示意同学们快点走。这时大概快5点多钟了，天快亮了。最后，我们就从广场东南角离开广场，然后走到六部口，从音乐堂到的西单，队伍慢慢散了。”
    高新说：“天安门广场清场全过程，可以说我是基本清楚的。我是在4日凌晨2时左右在广场看到过吾尔开希的。当时他在纪念碑上喊了几句话，就晕倒了，然后有人把他抬走了。整个清场过程我没有再看见吾尔开希。我参加绝食，属于认识问题，但作为一个人，首先应该尊重事实。我绝对不隐瞒事实，同时也不捏造事实”。
    他接着说：“在3日下午，我趁上厕所的工夫，在纪念堂西侧看到有几千人的部队，纪律很好，坐在地下待命。天安门前有群众围着部队。部队没有枪，也没有其他棍棒之类的武器。我回来和其他3个同志讲了，外面传过来的消息不属实，我看到的部队纪律很好。到了晚上12点左右，我们听到广场周围有零零星星的枪声，还传来了政府的广播声，由于人声嘈杂听不太清，但隐隐约约听到北京市发生了严重的反革命暴乱。这时，有的学生情绪很激动，有的手里还拿着棍棒等。我们4个人看到广场这个情况，觉得无论如何要坚持和平主张，就动员大家把棍棒收起来。后来，我们又在纪念碑上发现有人放着一挺机枪和冲锋枪。通过反复动员，他们把枪收起来了。之后，我们4个人又商量，由侯德健和周舵去找部队接触，希望部队能开一条通路，我和刘晓波继续留在纪念碑台阶上。侯德健和周舵回来，传达了部队首长的意见，很多学生开始向广场东南角撤离。这时走过来一些士兵，还有一个指挥官，他们用枪把广播喇叭打哑了，但自始至终没有对人群开枪，这是我看到的，很清楚。这时候，坦克也陆续从北往南开，走在最前面的坦克离我们只有20米左右。走到前门箭楼一带，我已是落在向外撤离的大学生队伍的最后一个，所以我这个目击者、见证人、或当事人，从纪念碑往南撤的整个过程和整个场面，我是看得很清楚的。”
    高新说：“在学生撤离时，我没有看到军人向人群开枪。如果对人群开枪，我觉得首先受伤死亡的应该是我，因我走在队伍最后面。在清场中没有一个人死亡，这是可以肯定的。不管
  ‘高自联’的头头在外面怎么‘宣传’说广场死了几千人、上万人，像肖斌在电视上面讲的，绝对是造谣。从一个人的人格出发，我可以说我讲的都是事实，没有夸大。”
    北京师范大学中文系讲师刘晓波说，我要对历史负责，因此有必要叙述一下当时我所看到的事实。6月4日凌晨2时左右，我从“高自联”广播中，听到“高自联”头头吾尔开希的发言，他说要与天安门广场共存亡，要战斗到最后一个人。正说着，他开始喘粗气，大概是心肌炎又犯了。在这以后再也没有见到他，也没有听到他的声音。当时吾尔开希躺着的担架在我们绝食的帐篷的东侧，我们走出帐篷后发现那副担架不见了。当时我与侯德健、周舵、高新商量了一下，由侯德健、周舵二人去找部队交涉，另外让“高自联”也出两个学生代表，但遭到柴玲的反对。
    谈到撤离的情况时，他说：“我没有看见部队朝群众开枪，他们开枪都是朝天打或是打广播喇叭。我也没有看见死亡一个人，更没有看见天安门广场血流成河。”
        广场救护站医生宋松、王海燕说：
    救护过程没有见到部队打死人
    6月4日凌晨和侯德健等人参加与戒严部队交涉的北京协和医院外科医生宋松回忆当时的情况时，对记者说：“6月3日下午到晚上，我受医院指派，在广场值班。因为我当时没戴手表，很多时间只能估计。约凌晨1点多钟，听到政府广播让学生离开广场，我当时在纪念碑北侧下边治疗几个被玻璃划伤的学生，这时看到广场北侧有车辆被烧着，也听到了长安街方向的枪声。此时‘高自联’广播站有‘血战到底’之类的话，学生是一会儿传来一个消息，说某某被打死了，许多学生的情绪十分激动，很不冷静。当时我觉得我作为一名医生，应该做些工作，让学生按政府要求撤出。但考虑我个人的作用不大，此刻到‘高自联’去提这样的建议，不一定起作用。我想到侯德健等人年龄较大，社会经验丰富，可能会冷静一些。同时他们在学生中有一定名气，可能会起一些作用。我和侯等4人不认识，但由于6月3日晚约十点受红十字会委派曾送水到纪念碑，知道他们绝食的地方，就决定试一下。两三点钟左右，我上到纪念碑最高层北侧，找到了他们。我以医生身份向侯德健等人提议，应该让学生撤出去，出现危险是不好的。侯德健等人谈到，他们也有这种想法，但他们不是‘高自联’的人，恐怕不好办。我又建议，是否可以和解放军直接谈一下。侯德健等人表示同意，并说希望我一块去，有个医生在场比较好些。我仔细考虑后，答应了。我从纪念碑下来拦车，当时广场上车很少，好不容易在广场西侧找到一辆小面包车，我向司机说帮忙拉侯德健去有解放军的地方，他说容易，就把我和侯德健、周舵拉到广场东北侧，此时看到长安街上全是解放军。我和侯、周及原来坐在车上的一个穿白大褂的人一起下车，举起双手走向解放军。几个军人问我们是干什么的，侯德健说：‘我代表我们4个绝食的人，想和解放军交涉，帮助学生和平撤出。’等了几分钟后，一个姓季的政委回来向我们说：经请示戒严部队指挥部，同意你们的建议。回纪念碑后，侯德健等人通过广播要学生撤出广场。学生们情绪逐渐缓解，并有人响应。约4点15分左右，广场西南角又看见烟雾并听到枪响（放催泪弹），学生中又开始骚动。由于担心撤出时学生情绪不稳定，侯德健、周舵和我又从纪念碑下来找解放军，在广场的东南侧碰到了季政委，刚看到他，广场的灯就全部关闭。侯德健问季政委是否可以多给学生一些时间，以便于和平撤出。季政委看了一下表说：清场的时间快到了，不能更改。如果你们对学生不起作用，你们自己就赶快撤出。我们马上往纪念碑跑，可我到纪念碑二层时，解放军已从另一个方向上到了纪念碑的最高层，把纪念碑上的喇叭打没声了，我们赶紧到纪念碑东侧和北侧，组织学生有秩序地向广场东南撤出。在撤出过程中，我没有看到死人，没有看到解放军向人群开枪，也没有看到学生与解放军直接冲突。”
    6月3日夜间奉红十字会命令在天安门广场担任救护任务的北京医科大学第一医院的几位大夫，向记者谈了类似的情况。北医第一医院副院长王海燕教授说：我们是在5月18日奉红十字会的命令在纪念碑东北角靠近马路的地方设立救护站的，并再三接到红十字会不让我们撤出的指令。6月3日晚，我们有七八个业务骨干参加救护队，在广场值班。6月4日凌晨黑灯前后，各家医院的医疗点先后从广场撤到历史博物馆西侧。我白天忙了一天，实在累了，就打起盹来，迷迷糊糊地听到一个沙哑的声音在广播，我听明白大意是要撤出广场，后来有人告诉我，说话的是侯德健。我赶快起来，听到广场上在唱国际歌，看到旗帜向南移动。我问帮助做救护工作的医科大学学生愿不愿和大家一起撤，话音未落，两阵枪声，纪念碑上正在响的喇叭哑了。金水桥前的坦克向广场缓缓开来，就我目力所及，未发现轧着人。一些穿迷彩服、拿冲锋枪的军人，来到我们跟前，距离我们只有1米左右。我对军人说：“我们是红十字会派来的医务人员。”一个扛录像机的军人命令战士向后撤，战士后撤到3米左右。我马上迎上去感谢他，和他握手。这时，一个四五十岁的只戴钢盔、无领章帽徽的军人走过来，我告诉他我们这里都是医务人员，还有伤员，希望能派军队护送我们撤出去。不一会儿来了6纵排解放军战士护送我们。我们把两个负伤的军人送回去，把非军人伤员抬在床上，4人一排，向广场东南走。此时天已大亮，我们一路上没见到打死的或轧死的人。我们刚走到历史博物馆南面的第一个胡同口，就听到路边小黄楼上向下开枪的声音，保护我们的解放军靠着墙和树架起枪向上还击。我们正在射程以内，我命令大家全体蹲下，原地向后转，又回到了历史博物馆西侧。在枪声停了以后，我们这批最后撤出广场的非军人，就从广场东南角坦克让出的通路最后离开了广场。
    当晚也在广场值班救护的泌尿外科大夫山刚志补充说：“那天晚上不断有伤员送来。这些伤员一般是钝器伤，有的是扭了脚，或是手上割了口子。其中有学生，也有解放军，我处理的伤员最重的是肱骨干骨折。一个解放军躺在地上，我弯腰为他治疗，一个汽水瓶从我脸边飞过，险些打着我的头。当时我们这个圈里气氛很融洽，我们给伤员喂水、喂饼干，一个伤员要喝水，解放军把自己的水壶给了他。”
        最后撤离广场的清华大学学生邹明
    等说：军队没有向学生和群众开枪
    在天安门广场清场过程中，在广场上的清华大学的一批学生，是跟在撤离队伍尾部最后离开广场的，他们以当事人的身份谈到了当天清场时的情况。工程物理系研究生邹明对记者说，我是6月3日晚8时许来到天安门广场的，10时左右听
  “高自联”的喇叭广播说，6月4日零时至1时部队很可能进入天安门广场，我想看看部队是怎么对待留在天安门广场的学生和群众的，于是留了下来。晚12时10分左右，我看见一辆装甲车从前门开入天安门广场，一些人拿着木棒追了过去。6月4日凌晨零点51分，大批部队从前门东侧进来了，聚集在纪念碑东侧。1时半，又有一些部队从西长安街过来了。这时我站在国旗旗杆附近，看到一些人朝部队扔砖头、汽水瓶。一会儿，我来到前门，部队开过来，于是我回到纪念碑东侧。我看到从人民大会堂东门出来不少士兵，围在纪念碑周围。“高自联”广播说，侯德健等人已跟部队一个团政委有接触，部队同意学生和群众和平撤离。但是有一些学生不同意撤离。我这时站在纪念碑东侧栏杆上，看到过来十几个士兵，他们从东边穿过学生聚集地，来到纪念碑北面，站成一排，示意学生让路，然后上了台阶。有一个军官模样的人手持自动步枪朝纪念碑上“高自联”设的喇叭点射。几个士兵来到三层东南角“高自联”广播站前把帐篷扯下来。过不久，我随撤退的学生队伍朝广场东南角走去，正走着，回头一瞧，看到一个士兵正在用自动步枪点射“高自联”广播站另外的喇叭。这时有一些学生骂士兵，但士兵没有朝他们开枪。我走出天安门广场时是凌晨5时多。
    热能系学生戴东海说，我是6月3日晚11时来到天安门广场的。12时过后，听到一片轰隆声，紧接着有一辆装甲车从前门沿历史博物馆一侧开了过来。这时，一些人把天安门广场上的栅栏推到马路上做路障。我看到靠近东观礼台一带有一辆装甲车着火了。一会儿又看到一些人搀扶着一个士兵朝历史博物馆附近的救护站跑，后面有人拿着木棒追。以后我来到纪念碑的第二层石阶上，“高自联”指挥部给每个人发了口罩和苏打水，说是防止催泪瓦斯用。我曾听到“高自联”广播中有人倡议拿起武器自卫，并说缴获了十几支枪。但遭到一些人反对。凌晨
  4时左右，广场上的灯突然灭了，没多久灯又亮了。以后我随着撤退的队伍从东南角走了出去，周围没有发现伤亡的同学和群众。上午9时回到学校。
    化工系学生刘卫说，6月3日上午10时我就来到了天安门广场，晚上听到“高自联”广播站和政府的广播站都在广播，政府的广播站广播说，那天晚上要清场。6月4日凌晨3时许，根据“高自联”广播站在广播中提出的要求，我们都围在纪念碑四周，我呆在东侧。4时左右听到“高自联”广播中侯德健、刘晓波等人征求大家的意见，是撤离还是坚持，结果要求撤离的声音比要求坚持的声音大一些，最后决定撤离。我曾看到部队在捣毁“高自联”指挥部时，朝天鸣枪示警。我们撤离的时候，广场上帐篷里肯定没人了，因为当时那么大的动静，又持续了那么长的时间，谁还会呆在帐篷里呢？
    清华大学原非法组织“筹委会”成员、工程物理系学生赵明对记者说，在撤退时，我与一些纠察队员负责检查纪念碑以南的帐篷内有无同学，检查结果没有一个。
        戒严部队军官季新国、顾本喜说：
    学生和平撤离、没有发生死亡事件
    北京部队某部团政委季新国上校、某部军官顾本喜中校，6月4日凌晨率部队参加了天安门广场清场的全过程，并且是同侯德健接谈的戒严部队代表。他们在向记者介绍六·四凌晨清场经过时说：
    6月4日凌晨1时半，首批戒严部队抵达天安门南面的金水桥一带集结，各路部队也相继到达广场四周的指定位置。从这时开始，人民大会堂楼顶的高音喇叭就不断广播北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部的紧急通告，指出：首都发生了严重的反革命暴乱，凡在天安门广场的公民和学生，应立即离开，以保证戒严部队执行任务。
    约3时半，从广场南侧向北驶来一辆救护车，在历史博物馆北面停了下来。车上下来4人，其中两位穿白大褂的是红十字会的医生。当时，这一带已无行人，他们的出现格外引人注目。他们神态慌张地举着双手，朝部队走来。戒严部队的一位团队指挥员向他们摆手，大喊“站住！”并派几人过去询问，来人中一位自我介绍：“我是侯德健，我们要求见部队的司令官，交涉广场上的学生和群众撤离的问题。”
    团队指挥员认为这是进一步做好学生工作，让他们尽快撤离广场的一个好时机，便说道：“请等一等，马上答复你们。”
    这一情况迅即向上级首长汇报。跟随部队开进的戒严指挥部工作人员顾本喜中校跑步到金水桥前，向现场最高指挥员报告了侯德健等提出交涉的要求。现场指挥员当即回答：“可以谈，告诉他们一定要撤离天安门广场，从广场东南方向撤出，越快越好！”
    于是，团政委季新国上校、顾本喜中校以及政治处主任王剑中校和一位保卫干事、两位警卫战士一同来到侯德健一行跟前。双方握手后，互相介绍了身份。对方来的除侯德健外，还有一位是四通公司的周舵。季新国和顾本喜首先说：“你们又搞绝食，对学生继续留在广场起了很坏的作用。”
      “我们已经停止绝食了。”侯德健和周舵答道。
    “停止绝食是明智的。”季、顾接过话茬说。
    接着，侯德健反映：“纪念碑那边现在很乱，一些学生想撤离，但对能不能和平撤离有顾虑，怕被军队包围，担心军人动武。能不能给点时间，我们给学生做工作。”
    季新国、顾本喜马上表示：党和政府及戒严部队是不愿看到流血的，我们曾一再表示实行戒严不是镇压学生和群众，现在已经发生反革命暴乱，为了使部队在执行任务时不误伤学生和群众，唯一的办法就是在广场上的学生和其他人都要无条件撤离。并指出，侯先生主动提出要做学生工作，我们是欢迎的。如果侯先生能说服、动员学生响应政府号召，尽快离开广场，你们就立了一功。
    侯德健听了很高兴，连声说：“好、好！一定回去做工作。”他又问道：“从哪里撤离？”季、顾告之：从广场的东南方向，部队在那里留了一条通道。
    分手时，侯德健还特地询问了季政委的名字和部队代号，说是回去好向学生做工作。季新国如实相告姓名、职务及部队代号。最后约定，他们同学生谈的情况如何，再碰头交涉。
    侯德健等4人走后，季新国、顾本喜跑步奔向金水桥，向现场指挥员汇报，首长们听后都说：好嘛！就是要动员他们撤离。
    4时20分左右，季新国、顾本喜和几个警卫战士一同朝广场南面走去。此时，广场上显得很空旷。走到离人民英雄纪念碑百把米时，纪念碑上的广播喇叭传来侯德健沙哑的声音，劝说学生撤离天安门广场。说经过与部队交涉，同意在广场的东南角留出一条学生撤离的通道。季、顾指出：应该说，侯德健他们不来交涉，戒严部队也预先留出了这条通道，清场时原本就是这样的部署。
    稍过片刻，侯德健、周舵和红十字会的两位医生朝北面走来了。双方相遇时，季、顾两人问他们做工作的情况怎样？
    侯答：学生们的情绪一时冷不下来，一部分人同意撤，一部分人还是主张坚守，有的还骂侯德健。侯说，希望再给一点时间做工作。
    季、顾说道：我们已经给了不少时间了，希望你们抓紧做工作。如果你们做不了，希望你们赶快离开广场，我们会保障你们的安全。
    在这次交谈中，侯德健还说学生担心部队没诚意，会开枪。顾中校当即反驳：怎么没诚意！你听广播！这时人民大会堂楼顶的高音喇叭正在广播：“戒严部队指挥部同意同学们的呼吁，从东南方向尽快撤离。”顾说：这说明戒严部队指挥部已经作出反应了。侯德健显出高兴的样子：“是嘛！希望多广播几遍，我们更好给学生做工作。”因临近清场，季、顾两人一再敦促他们要赶快撤离，时间不多了。如果还有人不愿撤，那你们也要赶快撤离广场。
    侯德健他们返回后，人民大会堂楼顶的高音喇叭停止了一段广播，以免声音嘈杂，影响侯德健他们给学生做工作。
    采访中，季新国和顾本喜指出：当戒严部队对广场实行清场的部署已布置就绪的情况下，侯德健、周舵等前来交涉，部队马上表示同意，对他们做动员学生撤离的工作表示欢迎，并指出了从东南方向撤离的道路。当戒严部队指挥部得到关于侯德健等前来交涉的情况报告后，马上作出反应，在广播中表示同意同学们撤出广场的呼吁。为便于他们做工作有更好的音响效果，大会堂楼顶的高音喇叭还一度停止播音。这说明戒严部队认真执行了党中央、国务院的政策，不但总的部署得当，而且连一些细节都考虑得很周全。
    大约4时10分，广场上的灯光熄灭了。有人造谣说这是为了便于部队采取镇压手段。对此，季政委、顾中校说：这纯粹是无稽之谈，是别有用心。他们告诉记者，熄灯、亮灯都是那天清场的信号。熄灯是通知戒严部队准备清场的信号，让各部队做好准备。4点半钟，广场上亮灯，这是开始清场的信号，以便协调统一行动。
    清场过程中，顾本喜一直随部队由北而南向前推进。他看到纪念碑周围的学生排着队、举着旗，从东南方向部队预留的通道撤离。队伍外围有学生纠察队维持秩序，前面一段走得比较整齐。
    季新国和顾本喜郑重地说：整个清场过程，除在捣毁“高自联”指挥部挂在纪念碑上的几个广播喇叭时战士们朝喇叭开了几枪外，没有向人群开过一枪，整个清场过程中没有打死一个人。
    季政委说，清场时战士们手里拿着棍子向前推进，但和撤离的学生队伍保持一定距离。部队未到跟前，学生队伍就开始外撤了，部队向前运动，他们就加快了撤离的速度。最后，纪念碑北侧有少数学生不愿外撤，部队只好强行将他们驱赶出去。
    顾本喜谈到：在装甲车开过来之前，指战员们已经按戒严部队指挥部的要求，一个个帐篷察看过里面是否有人。他亲自检查过一些帐篷，看见一位战友在一座帐篷里清出一个约莫30来岁的瘸子，还给了他一根棍子让赶快拄着离开。在另一座帐篷里，有一个女学生被吓昏了，战士们把她抬了出去。因为一个个帐篷都仔细检查过，装甲车开来时里面绝对没有人。
    季政委、顾中校指出，在天安门广场清场中，能够做到学生“和平撤离”，是党中央、国务院和中央军委的正确决策，是戒严部队正确执行政策的结果。他们说，当部队执行清场抵近纪念碑时，一些学生缺乏理智，仍在高呼反动口号，谩骂部队，甚至向指战员们扔石块、砸汽水瓶。如果不是部队采取克制态度，要求指战员坚决执行命令，流血死人就难以避免。
