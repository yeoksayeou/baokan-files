The 15th Men's Basketball Championship of Asia enters the second round today. The two teams from both sides of the Taiwan Strait both won their matches, defeating the Philippines team and the Saudi Arabian team respectively.

Beijing, September 20th - Reporter Chen Zhao reports: The 15th Men's Basketball Championship of Asia's second round began today. The two teams from both sides of the Taiwan Strait both won their matches, defeating the Philippines team and the Saudi Arabian team respectively.

The match between the Chinese men's basketball team and the Philippines team was one-sided. The Philippines team has lost its former glory. Whether in terms of player height or tactical skills, they are inferior to the Chinese team. In the end, they lost to the Chinese team 73:118.

Through this match, some weaknesses of the Chinese team's new lineup were also exposed. The most prominent weakness is that the technical and tactical level fluctuates greatly. Sometimes the game is exciting, but sometimes it is very dull. The second point is that the fast-break cooperation is not smooth. Our team members often intercept the ball in the backcourt and fast-break to the frontcourt, but because they cannot seize the opportunity, they have to play a set-piece game.

Of course, it should also be noted that the newly formed Chinese team, which is less than half a year old and young, has an average height advantage over the past. Especially a few tall players over two meters are quite agile. In addition, they are full of vigor on the court, showing the vitality of this new team.

The match between the Chinese Taipei team and the Saudi Arabian team was very tense and fierce. The Chinese Taipei team was behind for a long time. At halftime, they were behind 51:55. It was not until the very end that the Chinese Taipei team won a narrow victory over the Saudi Arabian team with a score of 92:88. In the other two matches of the top 8 second round, the South Korean team won against the Indian team with a score of 103:86, and the Japanese team won against the Iranian team with a score of 73:53.

It is reported that during this 15th Men's Basketball Championship of Asia, the Asian Basketball Federation will hold a representative conference in Beijing.

    第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛进入复赛
    海峡两岸健儿双双告捷
    本报北京9月20日讯　记者陈昭报道：第15届亚洲男篮锦标赛复赛今日开始，海峡两岸的两支球队双双告捷，分别战胜了菲律宾队和沙特阿拉伯队。
    中国男篮与菲律宾队的比赛呈现一边倒的局面。菲律宾队失去昔日的光彩，无论从队员身高还是技战术方面，都逊色于中国队，最后以73∶118输给中国队。
    通过这场比赛，也暴露了中国队新阵容的一些不足。比较突出的弱点第一是技战术水平起伏较大，有时场面精彩纷呈，有时却又十分沉闷。第二点是快攻配合欠默契，我方队员往往后场断球快攻到前场，因把握不住机会只好打阵地战。
    当然也应看到刚刚组建半年多的、年轻的中国队在平均身高上优于过去，特别是几个两米以上的高大队员比较灵活。另外他们在场上朝气蓬勃，显示了这支新队伍的活力。
    中国台北队与沙特阿拉伯队的比赛十分紧张激烈。中国台北队在很长一段时间内比分落后，上半时以51∶55落后于对手。直至最后，中国台北队才以92∶88险胜沙特阿拉伯队。在前8名复赛的另外两场比赛中，南朝鲜队以103∶86胜印度队，日本队以73∶53胜伊朗队。
    据悉，本届亚洲男篮锦标赛期间，亚洲篮联将在北京召开代表大会。
