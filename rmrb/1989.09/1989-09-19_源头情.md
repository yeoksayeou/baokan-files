In the depths of the Yan Mountains, there is a patch of flat grassland the size of a palm. A small river flows out from the black forest and the mountains, gurgling through the center of the grassland. By the river, there are three small houses made of grass and tiles, quietly welcoming the sunrise and sunset, and bidding farewell to the seasons. Li Sao, over fifty years old, guards these three empty rooms alone. Insiders say she refuses to move into the village because she misses her husband who died in this house.

In fact, living alone in the wilderness has many pleasures that ordinary people cannot experience. When her husband was alive, Li Sao often enjoyed wild pheasants, rabbits, and mushrooms and ferns from the mountains. As a woman, Li Sao found it very convenient to wash clothes, rinse rice, and bathe, which was something the village women could only dream of. But living alone also has many difficulties.

That year, the winding valleys of the Yan Mountains echoed with the roar of cannons. Someone told Li Sao that a vast army had marched into the Yan Mountains to build canals and dams, diverting water from Luan River to Tianjin. Li Sao didn't pay much attention. She continued to go up the mountain to plant trees, pick wild vegetables, and after eating dinner, she would leisurely soak and wash herself in the small river.

One day, a monitoring car bumped its way to her home. Three or five people, dusty and weary, jumped out of the car and waded into the river to collect water samples. Li Sao rarely had guests, let alone from the county seat. She boiled water to make tea, fried vegetables, and warmed wine, happily entertaining the guests. She didn't understand what suspended matter or pH value meant, but that day she learned that the small river in front of her house would flow through towering mountains and vast plains, eventually reaching Tianjin. The people of Tianjin praised this water as the water of happiness and holiness, and their songs reached Beijing...

In Li Sao's imagination, Tianjin was like heaven, but she had never heard that Tianjin lacked water. Moreover, to open mountains and build canals, all for the people of Tianjin to drink the water she used every day to wash rice and bathe.

The next day, she went to the river to wash clothes. While washing, she couldn't continue. The muddy water under her hands seemed like a long snake, fangs bared, lunging towards Tianjin. The soap suds were like hundreds of angry eyes... Her heart suddenly ached, and she quickly picked up the dirty clothes, went back to the house, and drew water from a bucket to wash them at the doorstep. After washing, she carefully poured the dirty water behind the house before letting out a long sigh. From then on, she no longer went to the river to wash or rinse rice. If any debris floated on the river surface, she would find a way to fish it out.

However, old habits are hard to break. A few times, Li Sao unconsciously carried the dirty clothes to the river, bringing a towel and soap to the riverbank. But she suddenly woke up and quickly left.

The county officials came on time to collect water samples, and over time, this became a joy in Li Sao's life. She was willing to entertain them, not just because they were tired from the long journey to collect samples, but also because she could learn a lot from the sampler, Old Zhang, such as the fact that the small river in front of her house is the source of an upstream tributary of the Luan River, the Luan River brings tens of billions of economic benefits to Tianjin, the progress of the pollution control project along the Luan River, and the special instructions from the State Council for this river, etc.

Li Sao always followed the samplers to the river to help. That year, the water was high, and Old Zhang slipped and fell into the water. When everyone was shouting for him to stand up, Li Sao had already jumped into the water and grabbed Old Zhang tightly. As a result, those who knew how to swim had to jump into the river. Li Sao's swimming skills were not as good as Old Zhang's. Li Sao caught a fever and deliriously called for Old Zhang to stand up. That day, the monitoring car stayed at her doorstep all night.

The forestry bureau urged Li Sao to move, but she refused, saying that living here allowed her to guard the mountain forest and provide a hot meal for the samplers. The forestry bureau asked the monitoring station to help persuade her, but the station said that Old Zhang had spent half his life as a bachelor and had just found some warmth at the source. The forestry bureau didn't dare to mention Li Sao's move again.

At dusk, Li Sao loved to stand in the grass by the river, watching the clear river water flow away. In her eyes, the colorful pebbles at the bottom of the river reflected the figure of Old Zhang, the bouncing monitoring car, and the tea cups filled with fragrant tea in the hands of the people of Tianjin... Watching and thinking, she often couldn't help but laugh out loud.

    源头情
    唐宝贤
    燕山深处一块巴掌大小平坦坦的草地，小河淌出黑森林大山，汩汩穿过草地中央，河边三间草瓦相间的小屋静静地迎来日出日落，送走春夏秋冬。五十开外的李嫂独守着三间空房，知情人说她不愿搬进村住是怀念死在这房里的丈夫。
    其实，独居荒山野岭有许多常人体味不到的乐趣。丈夫在世时，李嫂常能吃到山鸡、野兔和山蘑、蕨菜等野味；作为女人，李嫂洗衣、淘米、洗身子之方便，更为村里女人望尘莫及。但独居毕竟困难多。
    那一年，燕山蜿蜒的沟壑中响起隆隆炮声。别人告诉李嫂，千军万马开进了燕山，在修渠筑坝，引滦入津。李嫂没在意，依旧按时上山种树，采山菜，回家吃完饭后惬意地在小河里浸泡梳洗。
    一天，一辆监测车颠簸到她家，三五人风尘仆仆跳下车淌到河中采水样。李嫂家客人很少，何况是县城里来的。她烧水沏茶，炒菜温酒，高高兴兴招待客人。她不懂什么悬浮物、PH值，可今天她知道了，门前的小河要穿过崇山峻岭，漫过冀东平原，尔后直抵津门；天津人赞这水是幸福水、圣水，颂歌唱到了北京……
    在李嫂的想象中，天津胜似天堂，可她从未听说天津缺水，而且开山修渠，全为能喝上她天天淘米、梳洗过的水。
    翌日她到河边洗衣服，洗着洗着洗不下去了，手下泛起的混水，在她的想象中犹如一条长长的水蛇，张牙舞爪扑向津城，那块块肥皂沫儿，分明是几百双愤怒的眼睛……她心中骤然一阵绞痛，忙抱起脏衣服，回屋拎桶打水，坐在屋门口儿洗起来。洗完，小心翼翼把脏水泼到房后，才长舒了一口气。这以后，她洗漱、淘米再不去河边，河面偶尔漂过杂物，她也想方设法捞出。
    然而多年习俗很难一下子改变，有几次李嫂下意识地把脏衣服抱到河边，带着毛巾、香皂来到河边，但她猛醒过来，马上离去。
    县里人按时来采水样，久之，这成了李嫂生活中的一件乐事。她愿意招待他们，不光为他们长途颠簸采样辛苦，还为她能从采样的老张那儿学到不少东西，比如说门前的小河是滦河上游一个支流的发源地，滦水给天津带来几十亿经济效益，滦河沿岸治污工程进度，国务院为这条河的专门批示等等。
    李嫂总跟着采样的人到河边帮忙。那年水大，老张一脚没踩实被水冲倒，人们惊呼站稳之际，李嫂已扑进水中死死抓住老张，结果会水的不得不都跳下河，李嫂的水性本不及老张。李嫂发了烧，迷迷糊糊喊着让老张站稳。那天，监测车在她家门口儿停了一夜。
    林场动员要李嫂搬家，李嫂不肯，说住在这便于看护山林，还能让采样的吃上顿热饭。林场请监测站帮助动员，站上却说老张大半辈子打光棍儿，刚在源头得到点温暖，让林场“开开绿灯”。林场不好再提李嫂搬家的事了。
    黄昏，李嫂爱站在河边的草丛中目送着清清的河水潺潺流去。在她眼中，河底绚丽的卵石上闪烁着老张的身影，颠簸的监测车，天津人手中溢着浓香的茶杯……看着，想着，她常常禁不住笑出声。
