	According to the latest statistics from the relevant state departments, if calculated based on the 1985 comparable prices, there are currently 195 counties and 57.885 million people nationwide whose average annual net income is below 200 yuan. A comrade from the State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas said that these impoverished populations are mainly concentrated in areas with harsh natural conditions and low levels of social development, making the support more challenging.

	In accordance with the State Council's deployment and requirements to solve the basic living needs of the majority of people in poverty-stricken areas during the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, since 1986, the state has increased its investment of funds and materials in poverty-stricken areas, supporting large-scale economic development, and has achieved remarkable results. However, the task of poverty alleviation remains arduous. It is understood that the remaining impoverished population that has not yet solved the basic living needs problem is mainly concentrated in minority areas, reservoir areas, deep mountain areas, disaster-prone areas, and areas with difficulties in water supply for humans and livestock. The level of social productivity in these areas has not fundamentally changed. Among the 328 poverty-stricken counties currently being supported by the state, there are 141 minority poverty-stricken counties, accounting for 43%. Last year, the per capita industrial and agricultural output value of these minority poverty-stricken counties was 338 yuan, which was only 27% of the national average for the same period. At the same time, there are still 10 million people and 7 million head of livestock in poverty-stricken areas nationwide facing difficulties in water supply; 7 million resettled people in reservoir areas have not been properly resettled, and their lives are also very difficult.

	The increased difficulty in poverty alleviation is also reflected in the fact that due to the return of cultivated land to forestry and grassland and the adjustment of rural industrial structure, the per capita grain possession level in poverty-stricken counties nationwide has declined, and the amount of grain returned to rural areas has increased. In 1988, the per capita grain production in poverty-stricken counties nationwide was 306.8 kilograms, a decrease of 2.6% compared to 1985. The amount of grain returned to rural areas was 3.813 million tons, an increase of 29.3% compared to 1985.

	The State Council's Leading Group for Economic Development in Poverty-Stricken Areas requires that all levels of leadership must not be satisfied with the achievements made so far. They must continue to work hard and continue to take the poverty alleviation work, which the masses praise as "meritorious deeds," seriously.

    我国扶贫工作难度加大
    全国尚有五千多万农民人均收入低于二百元
    据国家主管部门最新统计，如果以1985年可比价格计算，目前全国尚有195个县、5788.5万人年纯收入平均水平低于200元。国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组同志说，这些贫困人口多集中在自然条件恶劣、社会发展程度较低的地区，扶持难度相对增加。
    根据国务院“七五”期间解决大多数贫困地区人民温饱问题的部署和要求，从1986年起，国家增加了对贫困地区的资金、物资投入，扶持贫困地区进行大规模的经济开发，取得了显著效果，但扶贫任务仍十分艰巨。据了解，目前剩下的尚未解决温饱的贫困人口，主要集中在少数民族地区、库区、深山区、多灾区和人畜饮水困难地区，这些地区的社会生产力水平尚未发生根本性变化。在目前国家重点扶持的328个贫困县中，少数民族贫困县有141个，占43％。去年，这些少数民族贫困县人均工农业产值338元，只相当于同期全国平均的27％。同时，全国贫困地区目前仍有1000万人、700万头牲畜饮水困难；库区700万移民尚未得到妥善安置，生活也十分困难。
    扶贫难度增加还表现在，由于退耕还林还牧和农村产业结构调整，全国贫困县人均粮食占有水平下降，返销粮增加。1988年全国贫困县人均粮食产量306.8公斤，比1985年减少2.6％，返销农村粮食381.3万吨，比1985年增长29.3％。
    国务院贫困地区经济开发领导小组要求各级领导绝不可满足于已取得的成绩，必须再接再厉，把被群众誉为“功德无量”之举的扶贫工作继续认真抓好。
