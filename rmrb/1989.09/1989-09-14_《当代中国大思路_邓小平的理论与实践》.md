Edition: 6

The book's fourth chapter examines Deng Xiaoping's views on maintaining stability and unity, and political stability. The authors argue that preserving a stable and united political environment is a crucial idea of Deng Xiaoping. Deng Xiaoping clearly stated that a stable and united political environment is an indispensable condition and guarantee for our socialist modernization. All party members, especially those in leadership positions, must cherish and safeguard this stable and united political environment. He also clarified the relationship between social stability and a vibrant democratic politics. He pointed out that we need both stability and vibrancy. Vibrancy is hard to achieve but develops alongside stability. Without a stable environment, vibrant democratic politics cannot be sustained. In China's context, it can be said that without stability, there is nothing, including democracy, the "Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought" policy, and so on, none of these can be discussed.

How to achieve and maintain a stable and united political environment? The authors introduce Deng Xiaoping's thoughts on this: First, clearly propose the Four Cardinal Principles and regard them as the foundation of the state. He emphasized that if any of the Four Cardinal Principles are shaken, the entire socialist cause and the entire modernization construction will be shaken. Second, correctly conduct the struggle against bourgeois liberalization. First, it is necessary to clearly oppose bourgeois liberalization. Next, for student unrest, it is necessary to mainly adopt the method of guidance. But if it affects social order and violates criminal law, it must be dealt with decisively. Then, it is necessary to explain the issue of democracy to the people and youth. The democracy that the Chinese people need today can only be socialist democracy, not Western-style bourgeois individualistic democracy. Finally, lessons must be learned from student unrest, using this as an opportunity to further improve work. Third, reform the party and state leadership system, strengthen the construction of the socialist system, and improve socialist legal system. Maintaining a stable and united political environment, of course, still relies on active and fundamental measures, which is to rely on economic development, educational development, and also on a complete legal system to guarantee it.

　　《当代中国大思路——邓小平的理论与实践》
　　金羽　陈先奎等著　中国人民大学出版社出版
    本书第四章研究了邓小平同志关于安定团结、政治稳定的论述。作者认为，保持安定团结的政治局面，是邓小平同志的一个重要思想。邓小平同志明确指出，一个安定团结的政治局面，是我们社会主义现代化事业不可缺少的条件和保证，全党党员，尤其是担负领导责任的党员，都要十分注意珍惜和维护安定团结的政治局面。他还明确讲明了社会安定团结与生动活泼的民主政治的关系。他指出，我们要安定团结，也要生动活泼。生动活泼来之不易，但它是随着安定团结发展起来的。如果没有安定团结的局面，生动活泼的民主政治就不能保持下去。在我国的情况下，可以说，没有安定团结，就没有一切，包括民主，“双百”方针等等，统统谈不上。
    如何达到和保持安定团结的政治局面？作者介绍了邓小平同志的以下思想：第一，明确提出四项基本原则，把四项基本原则作为立国之本。他强调，如果动摇了这四项基本原则中的任何一项，那就动摇了整个社会主义事业，整个现代化建设事业。第二，正确地进行反对资产阶级自由化的斗争。首先要旗帜鲜明地反对资产阶级自由化。其次，对学生闹事，主要采取疏导的方法是必要的。但如果影响了社会秩序，触犯了刑律，就必须坚决处理。再次，一定要向人民和青年讲清民主问题。中国人民今天所要的民主，只能是社会主义的民主，而不能是西方式的资产阶级个人主义的民主。再就是要从学生闹事中吸取教训，以此为契机，进一步做好工作。第三，改革党和国家的领导制度，加强社会主义的制度建设，健全社会主义法制。保持安定团结的政治局面，当然还是要靠积极的根本的措施，就是要依靠发展经济，发展教育，同时也要依靠完备的法制加以保证。
