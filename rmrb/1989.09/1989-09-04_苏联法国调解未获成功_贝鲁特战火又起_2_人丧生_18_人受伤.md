After a brief 4-hour ceasefire, fighting resumed this morning between Syrian and Lebanese Christian forces in Beirut. Two people were killed and 18 injured in the renewed shelling.

So far, the conflict between the Christian militia led by General Aoun and Syrian forces, along with their Lebanese Muslim militia allies, has lasted nearly six months, resulting in 824 deaths and 2,438 injuries.

Of the 1.5 million residents in the eastern and western districts of the capital, Beirut, 90% have fled their homes, leaving empty buildings that have been severely damaged by the fighting.

Meanwhile, Aoun held a press conference today at the presidential palace in the eastern part of Beirut. He criticized the United States for tolerating Syria's military actions in Lebanon, stating that he believes the current U.S. policy is to sacrifice Lebanon in order to resolve the Middle East crisis.

Aoun praised the Soviet Union's efforts for peace in Lebanon and the Middle East.

Over the past two weeks, both the Soviet Union and France have sent special envoys to Beirut, Damascus, and other Arab capital cities in an attempt to stop the fighting in Lebanon. However, due to the deep divisions among the warring parties, the mediation efforts by the two countries have not been successful.

    苏联法国调解未获成功
    贝鲁特战火又起
    2人丧生18人受伤
    新华社开罗9月2日电在经过短暂的4小时停火之后，叙利亚和黎巴嫩基督教军队之间的战火今晨又起，贝鲁特又有2人在炮火中丧生，18人受伤。
    至此，由奥恩将军领导的基督教军队同叙利亚军队及其支持的黎巴嫩穆斯林民兵之间的近6个月的冲突已造成824人丧生，2438人受伤。
    首都贝鲁特东西区150万居民中已有90％的人弃家出逃，空无一人的居民楼被炮火打得残缺不全。
    与此同时，奥恩今天在贝鲁特东区总统府内举行记者招待会，谴责美国容忍叙利亚在黎巴嫩的军事行动，奥恩认为美国当前的政策是牺牲黎巴嫩以达到其解决中东危机的目的。
    奥恩赞扬苏联为黎巴嫩及中东和平所作出的努力。
    在过去两个星期里，苏联和法国都向贝鲁特、大马士革和其他阿拉伯国家首都派出了特使，以便制止黎巴嫩的战火。但是由于交战各方分歧严重，两国的调停没有取得成功。（附图片）
