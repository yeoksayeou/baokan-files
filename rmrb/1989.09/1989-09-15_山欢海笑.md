Fujian's largest shrimp farming base is the Daguanshan Reclamation Area in Lianjiang County, covering 40,000 acres, which was originally a barren wasteland. In 1985, the area began excavating land for shrimp farming. After three years of development, the area expanded to 10,000 acres, with a total output of 833 tons last year. There are 225 shrimp farming households with an annual pure income of around 10,000 yuan each. This year, the shrimp farming area has expanded to 130,000 acres, and it is estimated that within two years, it will generate $10 million in foreign exchange for the country.

Fujian Province has established 1.56 million acres of specialized forests for rosin, paper-making, lacquer, purple lacquer, and edible fungi. All 38 rosin factories in the province have cooperated with village forest farms and forestry specialists to jointly develop forests. At the beginning of this year, the provincial party committee and government issued a call to "Work hard for seven years to green the eight provinces of Fujian." Now, this call is being turned into the actual actions of the masses.

Currently, there are 30 counties developing over 10,000 marine net-cage fish farms and 8,200 freshwater net-cage fish farms. The fish raised are mostly high-quality and rare species such as grouper, stonefish, flounder, and perch. It is estimated that this year, 1,800 tons of marine fish will be provided for export, with a value of 80 million yuan. Additionally, over 1,000 tons of fresh live freshwater fish will be supplied to the local market, enriching the "basket of goods."

Zhao'an County's Guanpi Township in Fujian was once a famous impoverished township, where 68% of the land suffered severe soil erosion, known as the "Flame Mountain." Local leaders, through the contract responsibility system, mobilized the enthusiasm of thousands of households to afforest and plant grass on the mountain tops, and plant fruits on the slopes and foothills. More than half of the township's "erosion areas" have been transformed into a mountain of flowers and fruits. The township's per capita pure income increased from 169 yuan in 1985 to 308 yuan.

　  荒滩辟成养虾场
    福建最大的对虾养殖基地是连江县大官坂垦区，面积四万亩，原是荒滩。一九八五年开始挖地养对虾，经过三年发展到一万亩，去年总产达八百三十三吨；有二百二十五户虾农一年纯收入一万元左右。今年养虾面积扩大到一点三万亩，预计两年可为国家创汇一千万美元。
　  荒山造出专用林
    福建省已创办松脂、造纸、栲胶、紫胶、食用菌等专用林基地一百五十六万亩。全省三十八个松脂厂普遍与乡村林场和林业专业户合资造林。今年初，省委、省府发出了“大干七年绿化八闽”的号召，如今，这号召正变成群众的实际行动。
  　网箱养鱼创汇多
    目前，已有三十个县发展海水网箱养鱼一万多个，淡水网箱养鱼八千二百多个。放养的鱼大多是真鲷、石斑鱼、比目鱼、鲈鱼等优质珍稀品种，预计今年可提供出口海鱼一千八百吨，产值八千万元，还可向当地市场提供一千多吨鲜活淡水鱼，丰富“菜篮子”。
  　“火焰山”上花果香
    福建诏安县官陂乡曾是个有名的贫困乡，这里百分之六十八的土地水土流失严重，被称为“火焰山”。当地领导靠承包责任制，调动千家万户治山热情，山顶造林种草，山腰山脚种果。全乡一半以上的“流失区”变成花果山。全乡人均纯收入从一九八五年的一百六十九元提高到三百○八元。
