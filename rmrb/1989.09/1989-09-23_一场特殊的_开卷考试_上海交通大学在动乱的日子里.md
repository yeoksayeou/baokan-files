Xinhua News Agency, September 23, 1989

In the spring and summer, the Republic suffered a horrifying political disaster. The capital Beijing experienced a shift from student protests to turmoil to counter-revolutionary riots, which spread throughout the country. This wave naturally also swept through Shanghai Jiao Tong University, which was known as the "pioneer" in the 1986 student protests.

"Jiao Tong University stands up, Jiao Tong University comes out!"

"Democracy and freedom, take to the streets to protest!"

At around 2 AM on April 18, over 1,000 students from a university in Shanghai suddenly rushed into the quiet campus of Jiao Tong University, inciting and rallying for trouble. At this moment, over a hundred cadres, teachers, and staff from various departments of Jiao Tong University quickly rushed to the scene to persuade and stop them. Half an hour passed, and the students of Jiao Tong University finally handled the matter rationally. Almost no one followed them to protest on the streets. Jiao Tong University successfully weathered the first wave of turmoil.

From April 15 to May 16, during these difficult and confusing days, the party and administrative leaders of Jiao Tong University relied closely on the broad masses of teachers and staff to fight against bourgeois liberalization. They withstood wave after wave of attacks, basically stabilized the students' emotions, and maintained normal and stable teaching order throughout the school. After May 4, Jiang Zemin, then Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, met with the party and administrative leaders of Jiao Tong University and said, "The enemy is at the gates, but Jiao Tong University stands firm. We must summarize our experiences."

Eliminating the seeds of trouble in the bud

After the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang on April 15, some people in the Jiao Tong University campus used the opportunity to post big and small character posters attacking the party and the government, and inciting students to protest on the streets. The party and administrative cadres of Jiao Tong University, who had experienced the 1986 student protests, sensed that a storm was about to come. They learned from the experiences and lessons of the previous student protests and decided to eliminate the seeds of trouble in the bud. The school quickly organized a mobile team of over 200 people to handle various emergencies. As soon as big and small character posters appeared on the campus, they were promptly and decisively dealt with, strictly prohibiting the "four big freedoms" from spreading on the campus. A few students who were emotionally excited went out to the streets, and they chased after them, persuading them one by one until they returned to the school. Some people in the crowd cursed them. They retorted confidently, "Jiao Tong University has its own school rules and regulations. Without permission, students are not allowed to protest on the streets. This is how Jiao Tong University does it!"

At around 2 AM on May 2, shortly after the lights were turned off in the Minhang campus of Jiao Tong University in the southwestern suburbs of Shanghai, some students gathered downstairs and caused a commotion. Over 1,000 people rushed out of the school gate, intercepting public buses to enter the city for protests. Upon hearing the news, the school leaders immediately led reinforcements from the main campus in the city to rush to the Minhang campus. They persuaded the students with reason and emotion, convincing them to return to their dormitories to sleep, and together they calmed down the commotion. Then, they decided overnight to send cars to bring all the deans, party branch secretaries, and class advisors, totaling over 200 people, to the Minhang campus before dawn. The next morning, after the students' wake-up bell rang, the school's loudspeakers repeatedly broadcasted the principal's speech. At the same time, the system leaders and teachers promptly did the guiding work in the students' dormitories, and the teachers taught their classes on time. A potential strike was thus avoided.

Before this, the school had taken various measures and organized various activities to attract students' attention to the campus. The school proactively set up a memorial hall for Comrade Hu Yaobang, organizing everyone to go and pay their respects, expressing their grief. To prepare for watching the live broadcast of Hu Yaobang's memorial service on April 22, the entire school opened 146 television viewing points, organizing all teachers and students to watch. Each viewing point was solemn and orderly. These memorial activities satisfied the students' reasonable and legitimate demands, so the students called it "qualified."

Starting from April 24, the school's Youth League Committee and Student Union launched a series of activities themed "Love the country, honor the school, seek knowledge, and develop" to commemorate May 4. The student chorus was also selected to participate in the city-wide college chorus television competition on May 3, winning second prize, city-level outstanding organization award, and four other awards. On May 4, several dozen colleges and universities in Shanghai had tens of thousands of students protesting on the streets. That night, thousands of students and onlookers surrounded the "Kang Office" (the office of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China), preparing to sit in and apply pressure throughout the night. A few hundred meters away from the "Kang Office," Jiao Tong University, except for a few dozen students from the Minhang campus who followed the protesting crowd to the "Kang Office" in the afternoon and then returned to the school, the main campus was almost "standing still," with no organized support activities. On the night of May 4, the Jiao Tong University campus was still filled with songs and dances, and the students were immersed in joy.

Standing firm in rectifying the micro-environment

The wind does not stop when the tree wants to be still. On May 4, Zhao Ziyang's speech during his meeting with the guests of the Asian Development Bank meeting sent out another voice that was inconsistent with the Party Central Committee. Following the wrong guidance of public opinion, some newspapers and magazines repeatedly reported that students protesting on the streets was a "patriotic action."

Was it turmoil or a patriotic democratic movement? Was it unpatriotic to stop students from protesting on the streets?! The cadres, party members, and teachers of Jiao Tong University working on the front line were puzzled and even could not suppress their doubts and indignation. Many people were under increasing ideological pressure. In the afternoon of May 6, the school's Party Committee held a symposium with some party branch secretaries to analyze the current ideological trends of cadres and students. After discussion, most people thought that in the previous period, the school's upper and lower levels were united, working together, and achieved four normalities: stable and normal teaching order; basically normal situation of stability and unity; normal memorial activities; normal May 4 commemorative activities, and were repeatedly affirmed and praised by the municipal committee leaders. This direction of rectifying the micro-environment was correct and in line with the spirit of the Central Committee. Even if the wishes of the vast majority of students were good, various radical actions were wrong, so we should confidently carry out ideological and political work.

However, facing the rampant so-called "patriotic democratic movement," the students of Jiao Tong University were under increasing pressure. "Jiao Tong University students are 'inferior,'" "Jiao Tong University students were wrong to be at the forefront in 1986, and it was also wrong to fall behind this time," and so on. The wrong guidance of public opinion further intensified the ideological confusion. The Jiao Tong University students, who were unwilling to be "left behind," finally broke the dam on May 17, with nearly 3,000 people taking to the streets for the first time. From then on, big and small character posters, protests, sit-ins, and hunger strikes followed one after another, and the situation was out of control.

The wrong guidance of public opinion at that time also confused some people within the party and the teaching staff of Jiao Tong University. Some said, "It seems like the 'Cultural Revolution' again, and the taste of re-choosing sides has appeared." Some hesitated, and some retreated. Many cadres who insisted on working on the front line were attacked, cursed, and even threatened. The school's Party Committee and the school's work began to face difficulties, and there was a time when it seemed almost impossible to continue. Even at this time, they felt that although they were powerless against the macro-environment, they had to firmly rectify the micro-environment. They had to do their best to improve the cadres' ability to withstand this complex political environment and do their best to do student work, resolutely opposing the turmoil.

The struggle between "empty school" and "anti-empty school" that began after May 28 was a head-to-head confrontation between the school and the illegal organization "High Autonomy Federation." At that time, the "High Autonomy Federation" and its followers did their best to incite students to "empty the school and go home," threatening students who wanted to attend classes, making them dare not enter the classroom. But this was ultimately a losing battle, unpopular, and the "restoration of normal teaching order" and "attending classes" could gain the support of the majority of teachers and also met the wishes of many students. Many teachers, with the determination to teach even if there was only one student, took turns to travel between the main campus in the city and the Minhang campus. At the most difficult time, a physics teacher faced the only student in the classroom and taught as usual. The student was moved and said, "Teacher, I will definitely come to class next time." To restore the order of attending classes, the party branch secretary of a department ran from one dormitory to another, mobilizing students to attend classes. The party branch secretary of a department simply sat in the classroom with the students, protecting the students who entered the classroom to have a good class. For the behavior of the heads of the school's "self-governing council" openly disrupting the teaching order, the school posted a notice, naming and criticizing them without mercy.

On the morning of June 4, some students from the main campus rushed to the Minhang campus, attempting to incite the lower-grade students here to set up roadblocks on the streets. As soon as they entered the school gate, all the cadres and teachers of the campus took action, resolutely resisting them, and finally made them retreat to the city in disgrace. Due to the in-depth and detailed work carried out in the Minhang campus, there were basically no students who participated in the illegal blockade of Shanghai traffic and other actions.

However, the situation in the main campus became increasingly severe. After June 4, influenced by the rampant rumors, many students lost their reason and set up roadblocks, blocked traffic, and even took the lead in participating in the city-wide illegal memorial procession. On June 10, they even attempted to organize a team to go to the "Kang Office" to sit in and protest. To prevent students from sliding further down the wrong path, the school's Party Committee mobilized the entire school's strength to stop it, organizing cadres and teachers double the number of students to go out, and finally persuaded them to stop a brewing turmoil in a righteous and stern manner. On that very day, the school's "self-governing council" felt that the situation was hopeless and declared "bankruptcy." On June 11, the school thoroughly cleaned up the campus, and the environment returned to normal, restoring the past tranquility.

An opportunity to strengthen ideological work

Two months of storms and stresses were a special "open-book exam." After the storm passed, reflecting on the pain, it left many questions for the teachers and students of Jiao Tong University to think about and resolve:

First, to treat the symptoms, but more importantly, to treat the root cause, to achieve long-term stability in the school. In recent years, "April 5," "May 4," "December 9," and other revolutionary memorial days have almost become taboo days. They were afraid of students, indulged students, and feared that students would cause trouble. Many cadres and teachers would be on standby on these days, ready to act as "firefighters" at any time. The 1986 student protests were not thoroughly cleaned up ideologically. This student protest came again, developing into turmoil, and Beijing even saw counter-revolutionary riots. The lesson is profound. Although social and objective factors are important, they felt that as a higher institution of learning, they must consider how to make the education of adhering to the four cardinal principles as the main course in talent building, taking root in the minds of students. This is the fundamental way to achieve long-term stability in the school. First of all, educators must be educated, so that the majority of teachers have a sense of urgency and responsibility to educate students to adhere to the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization.

Second, the party's grassroots organizations must be the political core of the school's grassroots, and must clearly oppose the turmoil. In this critical moment of turmoil, the school's Party Committee could gather more than a hundred members of the Party Committee's core group and student ideological and political work cadres within half an hour, unify their thoughts, and take immediate action, showing their combat effectiveness. A batch of party grassroots organizations played the role of a stronghold. The branch of the school's Public Security Bureau was on duty day and night for two months, repeatedly "catching" illegal organization members from outside. On June 6, Zhou Shaowu, a core member of the "High Autonomy Federation" in Beijing, sneaked into Jiao Tong University to organize a rally, and was caught by the school's Public Security Bureau. But in this political exposure, some units ignored the repeated warnings of the school's Party Committee and massively copied the content of spreading rumors in the Hong Kong newspapers after June 4; another unit wore black armbands to mourn for several days after June 4; some party organizations and Communist Party members lacked the ability to distinguish and fight against reactionary trends and rumors. It exposed some weak links in the school's party organizations, and there were still some gaps and even loopholes.

Third, uniting, educating, and improving young teachers is an urgent task for the school. Teachers under the age of 35 already account for more than 40% of the total number of teachers at Jiao Tong University. They are active in teaching, scientific research, management, and other positions, and are the future and hope of the school. But it must be admitted that the influence of bourgeois liberalization is more prominent among some young teachers. In this political struggle, a certain number of young teachers could not withstand the wrong guidance of public opinion and the incitement of rumors, participating in radical actions. Therefore, the education and improvement of this team can no longer be ignored.

Fourth, the school and society have the responsibility to jointly undertake the education and cultivation of young students. The biggest problem among contemporary college students is that they do not understand the national conditions, lack recognition and affection for the party and the socialist system, are more influenced by Western thought, emphasize self-design, and place personal interests above everything else, while neglecting workers and peasants and ignoring practice. This is the result of our educational mistakes. The school must make up for their deficiencies in politics, theory, and practice, supplementing whatever is lacking. At the same time, we appeal to the whole society to care about and do a good job in this regard, including solving the production practice sites for students, so that students have more opportunities to contact workers and peasants, understand the reality, and understand the national conditions. This is an important aspect of the political growth of young students.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping's repeated speeches and the convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee are like a strong spring breeze, making people sober, think, and be inspired. The Party Committee of Jiao Tong University realized that this was an opportunity for the school to strengthen ideological and political work. They used the summer vacation to first conduct training for the leading cadres at the school and department levels. Then, they concentrated for a week, spending effort to give the final ideological education class to 1,732 graduating students. Through learning and discussion, watching the suppression of the riot video, individual talks, and key help, the vast majority of graduating students seriously reflected, had a correct initial understanding of this serious political struggle, and made a realistic and self-critical review and reflection of their performance in the student protests and turmoil. Thus, they put down their burdens, improved their thoughts, and walked into society with a relatively healthy mentality.

The students of Jiao Tong University, who have weathered the storm, are now back in the classroom. At the beginning of the new academic year, the school organized all teachers and staff to undergo training, thinking together about the past, facing reality, and looking to the future.

    一场特殊的“开卷考试”
    ——上海交通大学在动乱的日子里
    新华社记者　郭礼华　新华社通讯员　朱隆泉
    春夏之交，共和国遭受了一场骇人听闻的政治灾难。首都北京从学潮到动乱到反革命暴乱，并波及于全国。这股浪潮自然也肆虐地冲向在1986年学潮中被称为“带头羊”的上海交通大学。
    “交大起来，交大出来！”
    “民主自由，上街游行！”
    4月18日凌晨2时许，上海一所高校的1000余名学生突然冲进寂静的交大校园，串联鼓动闹事。这时，上百名日夜待命的交大校、系和部门的干部、教师迅速赶到现场，劝说拦阻。半小时过去了，交大学生终于理智地处理了这件事。几乎没有人跟着上街游行。交大顺利地度过了这次动乱洪峰中的第一个浪头。
    从4月15日到5月16日这段艰难困惑的日子里，交大党政领导紧紧依靠广大教职员工，同资产阶级自由化作斗争，顶住了一次次冲击，基本稳住学生情绪，全校教学秩序稳定正常。“五四”过后，当时任上海市委书记的江泽民见到交大党政领导说：“大兵压境，交大巍然不动，要总结总结。”
        把闹事苗子消灭在萌芽阶段
    4月15日胡耀邦同志逝世以后，交大校园里有人借悼念之名，贴出了攻击党和政府的大、小字报，并煽动学生上街游行闹事。经过1986年学潮磨难的交大党政干部，预感到风暴即将来临。他们吸取上次学潮中交大“冲锋陷阵”的经验教训，决心把闹事苗子消灭在萌芽状态。全校很快组织起一支两百多人的机动队伍，随时应急处理各种突发事件。大、小字报在校园内一出现，他们就及时果断地处理掉，严格禁止“四大”在校园里蔓延。少数学生情绪冲动上了街，他们就追到队伍中，一个一个地规劝，直到拉回学校。围观人群中有人对此进行谩骂。他们理直气壮地回击：“交大有交大的校规校纪，未经批准不准上街游行，交大就是这样做！”
      5月2日深夜，地处上海西南郊的交大闵行校区熄灯不久，有部分学生下楼集结哄闹。1000余人冲出校门，拦截公交车辆要进市区游行。校领导闻讯，立即带领增援力量从市区校本部火速赶到闵行校区现场，晓之以理，动之以情，说服学生返回寝室睡觉，共同平息了这场哄闹。接着，他们连夜研究决定，在天亮前派车把所有在家休息的系主任、党总支书记、班主任共200多人接到闵行校区。第二天清晨，学生起床铃响后，学校喇叭反复广播校长讲话。同时系领导、教师把疏导工作及时做到学生寝室，任课教师按时上课，一场变相的罢课终于避免了。
    在此之前，学校就采取多种措施，开展各项活动，把同学的注意力吸引在校内。学校主动设置了胡耀邦同志的灵堂，组织大家前去悼念，寄托自己的哀思；为了准备收看4月22日胡耀邦同志追悼大会的电视实况转播，全校开放了146个电视放映点，组织全校师生收看，各放映点庄严肃穆，秩序井然。这些悼念活动满足了学生们正当合理的要求，因此学生们称它是“够格的”。
    从4月24日起，校团委和学生会在全校学生中开展了以“爱国、荣校、求知、发展”为主题的“五四”纪念系列活动。学生歌咏队还被选拔参加5月3日全市高校歌咏电视大赛，获得了二等奖、市级优秀组织奖等5个奖。5月4日，上海有几十所高校数万名学生上街游行。当晚，数千名学生及围观群众包围“康办”（中共上海市委办公地），准备彻夜静坐施加压力。距“康办”几百米的交大，除几十名闵行校区学生下午跟随游行队伍跑到“康办”就回校外，校本部几乎“按兵不动”，没有发生有组织的声援活动。“五四”之夜，交大校园内仍然是歌声舞姿，同学们沉浸在欢乐之中。
            立足治理小气候
    树欲静而风不止。5月4日赵紫阳同志在会见亚行年会客人时的讲话，发出了与党中央不一致的另一种声音。紧跟着错误的舆论导向，一些报刊连篇累牍地宣传学生上街游行是“爱国行动”。
    到底是动乱还是爱国民主运动？难道劝阻学生上街游行是不爱国？！处在第一线工作的交大干部、党员、教工对赵紫阳的讲话大惑不解，甚至按捺不住心头的疑虑和愤慨。不少人承受着越来越重的思想压力。5月6日下午，校党委召开部分党总支书记座谈会，分析当前干部、师生的思想动向。经过讨论，多数人认为，前一时期，学校上下团结一致，齐心协力工作，做到了4个正常：教学秩序稳定正常；安定团结的局面基本正常；悼念活动正常；“五四”纪念活动正常，多次获得市委领导同志的肯定和赞扬。这种立足治理小气候的方向是对的，符合中央精神。即使极大多数学生愿望是好的，但种种过激做法是不对的，因此我们应该理直气壮地把思想政治工作做下去。
    但是，面对着甚嚣尘上的所谓“爱国民主运动”，交大学生受到越来越大的压力。什么“交大学生‘推扳’（意即差劲）”，“交大学生1986年冲在前面错了，这次落在后面又错了”，等等。错误舆论导向，又加剧了思想混乱。不甘“落后”的交大学生终于在5月17日似堤坍坝决，近3000人的声援队伍第一次走上了街头。从此，大小字报、游行示威、静坐绝食接踵而来，不可收拾。
      当时的错误舆论导向也使交大党内、教职工队伍中的一部分人糊涂起来，有的说：“现在好像‘文化大革命’，又出现了要重新站队的味道”。少数人犹豫了，有的退却了。而许多坚持在第一线工作的干部受到攻击谩骂，甚至威胁恐吓。校党委和学校的工作开始步履维艰，有一度几乎有点做不下去。即使在这时，他们感到，对大气候虽无能为力，但小气候还是要坚定地治理。要尽一切可能提高干部对这种复杂的政治环境的承受能力，尽最大可能与力量做好学生工作，坚决反对动乱。
    5月28日以后开展的“空校”与“反空校”斗争，是学校与非法组织“高自联”之间的一场针锋相对的较量。当时“高自联”及其追随者竭尽全力煽动学生“空校回家”，胁迫要上课的学生，使之不敢进入教室。但这终究是理亏的，不得人心的，而“恢复正常教学秩序”、“要上课”，却能获得广大教师的支持，也符合相当多学生的心愿。许多任课教师怀着就是一个学生也要坚持上课的心情，日以继夜地乘班车往返于市区校本部和闵行校区两地。在最困难的时候，一名物理教师面对着课堂里仅有的一名学生，仍和往常一样上课，这名学生感动地说：“老师，下次上课我一定再来。”为了恢复上课秩序，有个系的党总支正副书记从一个寝室跑到一个寝室，动员学生前去上课。有个系党总支书记干脆就坐在教室里陪着听课，保护进教室的学生上好课。对于校“自治会”头头公开破坏教学秩序的行为，学校张贴通告，点名批评，毫不手软。
    6月4日清晨，校本部有部分学生冲到闵行校区，企图鼓动在这里的低年级学生上街去设置路障。他们一进校门，校区的干部教师就全部出动，坚决地进行抵制，终于使这批人灰溜溜地退回市区。由于闵行校区开展深入细致的工作，留校学生中基本上没有参与堵塞上海交通等违法行动。
    但是，校本部的形势越来越严峻。6月4日以后，受铺天盖地谣言的影响，不少学生失去理智去设路障、堵交通，甚至带头参加全市性的非法悼念游行。6月10日还企图组织队伍到“康办”去静坐、抗议。为了不让学生在错误的道路上越滑越远，校党委动员全校力量加以制止，发动了一倍于学生出动人数的干部和教职工，终于义正词严地劝息了一场酝酿中的动乱。就在当天，校“自治会”感到大势已去，宣告“破产”。11日，学校全面清理校园，环境恢复正常，出现了往日的宁静。
          加强思想工作的契机
    两个月的风风雨雨，是一场特殊的“开卷考试”。风暴过去之后，痛定思痛，它给交大师生留下了许多值得思考和未了的问题：
    思考之一，要治标，但更要治本，做到学校长治久安。这些年来，“四·五”，“五·四”、“一二·九”等革命纪念日几乎成了忌日。害怕学生，迁就学生，唯恐学生闹事。许多干部、教师到这一天就紧急待命，随时准备充当“消防队”。1986年学潮并没有从思想上彻底清理整顿。这次学潮又汹涌而来，发展到动乱，北京还出现反革命暴乱。教训是深刻的。社会的、客观的原因固然重要，但他们感到，作为高等学府必须考虑怎样把坚持四项基本原则的教育作为人才建设的主课，在学生头脑里扎根，这是实现学校长治久安的根本。首先要让教育者受教育，使广大教师有对学生进行坚持四项基本原则教育、反对资产阶级自由化的紧迫感和责任感。
    思考之二，党的基层组织必须是学校基层的政治核心，要旗帜鲜明地反对动乱。在这次动乱紧急关头，校党委可在半个小时内把百余名党委中心组成员和学生思想政治工作干部集中起来，统一思想，立即行动，显示了战斗力。一批党的基层组织发挥了战斗堡垒作用。校公安处支部，两个月中日夜吃睡在岗位上，多次“咬”住外来非法组织人员。北京“高自联”骨干周少武6月6日窜到交大串联时，被校公安处盯牢，终于将其捉拿归案。但在这次政治大曝光中，也有个别单位不顾校党委一再劝阻，大量复印6月4日以后的香港报纸中造谣惑众的内容，另一个单位在6月4日后数天内佩戴黑纱表示所谓悼念；一些党的组织和共产党员面对反动思潮、惑众谣言，缺乏分辨力和战斗力。它暴露了学校党组织的一些薄弱环节，还有一些缝隙甚至缺口。
    思考之三，团结、教育和提高青年教师是学校迫在眉睫的一项任务。35岁以下的青年教师已占到交大教师总数的40％以上。他们活跃在教学、科研、管理等岗位上，是学校的未来和希望。但应该承认，资产阶级自由化思潮的影响在部分青年教师中较为突出。在这次政治斗争的考验中，就有一定数量的青年教师顶不住错误舆论的导向，顶不住谣言的煽动，参与了过激行动。因此对这支队伍的教育和提高已不容忽视。
    思考之四，学校和社会有责任共同来承担对青年学生的教育和培养。当代大学生中，最大的问题是不了解国情，对党和社会主义制度缺乏认识和感情，受西方思潮影响较多，强调自我设计，个人利益高于一切，同时轻视工农，忽视实践，这是我们教育失误的结果。学校必须从政治上、理论上、实践上给他们补课，缺什么补什么。同时吁请全社会都来关心并做好这件事，包括解决学生的生产实习场地，让学生有更多机会接触工农，了解实际，懂得国情。这是青年学生政治上成长的一个重要方面。
    邓小平同志的多次讲话和党的十三届四中全会的召开，犹如强劲的春风，令人清醒、思索、振奋。交大党委意识到这是学校加强思想政治工作的契机。他们利用暑期，首先对校、系两级领导骨干进行了轮训学习。接着，又集中一周时间，花力气给1732名应届毕业生上好在校思想教育的最后一课。通过学习讨论，收看平暴录像，个别谈心，重点帮助，绝大多数毕业生认真反思，对这场严重的政治斗争有了正确的初步认识，对自己在学潮和动乱中的表现作了实事求是的回顾和反省，从而放下了包袱，思想有了提高，以比较健康的心态走上了社会。
    经受了风雨的交大学生如今已重新坐在教室里。新学年一开始，学校就组织全校师生员工轮训学习，共同思考过去，面对现实，展望未来。
