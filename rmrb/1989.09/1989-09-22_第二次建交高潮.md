The Second Wave of Establishing Diplomatic Relations

After the Bandung Conference, from 1956 to 1965, China established diplomatic relations with many countries, marking the second wave of establishing diplomatic relations. The number of countries that established diplomatic relations with China increased from 22 at the end of 1955 to 49 at the end of 1965.

During this period, China's relations with Arab countries saw breakthroughs, as it successively established diplomatic relations with Egypt, Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Algeria, Morocco, Sudan, Somalia, Tunisia, Mauritania. Regarding African countries, China took the initiative, adopting a serious yet flexible approach. From 1959 to 1964, it successively established diplomatic relations with Guinea, Ghana, Mali, Congo (Léopoldville) (renamed Zaire in 1971), Tanganyika (renamed Tanzania in 1964), Uganda, Kenya, Burundi, Congo (Brazzaville), Central African Republic, Zambia, Dahomey (renamed Benin in 1975), and other countries. Cuba was the first Latin American country to establish diplomatic relations with China, and on September 28, 1960, China and Cuba issued a joint communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations. On January 27, 1964, China and France established diplomatic relations.

The second wave of establishing diplomatic relations emerged because many countries that persisted in anti-imperialist and anti-colonial struggles and sought national independence saw that China vigorously advocated and practiced the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, making significant contributions to the success of the Bandung Asia-Africa Conference. In international affairs, China firmly stood on the side of oppressed nations. Therefore, these countries were willing to develop relations with China. At the same time, China took a proactive and positive attitude towards developing relations with these countries and, through the establishment of diplomatic relations, strengthened friendly relations with them in the political, economic, and cultural fields.

    第二次建交高潮
    万隆会议后，从1956年到1965年的10年间，中国又同许多国家建立外交关系，出现了第二次建交高潮。同中国建交的国家从1955年底的22个增加到1965年底的49个。
    这一时期，中国与阿拉伯国家的关系有突破，先后与埃及、叙利亚、阿拉伯也门、伊拉克、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥、苏丹、索马里、突尼斯、毛里塔尼亚建交。对非洲国家，中国采取主动工作，既严肃又灵活的方式，从1959年到1964年相继同几内亚、加纳、马里、刚果（利）（1971年改名扎伊尔）、坦噶尼喀（1964年改名坦桑尼亚）、乌干达、肯尼亚、布隆迪、刚果、中非、赞比亚、达荷美（1975年改名贝宁）等国建立了外交关系。古巴是第一个同中国建交的拉美国家，1960年9月28日中古发表建交联合公报。1964年1月27日，中国和法国建交。
    第二次建交高潮的出现，是因为许多坚持反帝、反殖斗争和争取民族独立的国家看到，中国大力倡导和奉行和平共处五项原则，为万隆亚非会议的成功作出了重大贡献，在国际事务中坚决站在被压迫国家一边，所以愿意同中国发展关系。同时，中国对发展同这些国家的关系持积极主动态度，并通过建交加强与它们在政治、经济和文化领域的友好关系。
