The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, and members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan, held a press conference for Chinese and foreign journalists in the Great Hall of the People this morning. They answered questions from journalists on China's domestic and foreign policies.

Beijing was drizzly today, and more than 300 Chinese and foreign journalists arrived early at the Central Hall on the third floor of the Great Hall of the People, where the press conference was held. At 10:00 AM, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhou Nan announced the start of the press conference. General Secretary Jiang Zemin expressed his pleasure at the opportunity to meet with everyone and introduced the members of the Politburo Standing Committee.

In response to journalists' questions, Jiang Zemin emphasized that the turmoil in Beijing was a counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at opposing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and overthrowing the socialist system. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping has said, this turmoil, which escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, was inevitable due to both international and domestic factors. Jiang Zemin stated that the facts have proven that the Communist Party of China is a great party, and we have been able to quell this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, ultimately achieving decisive victory.

Jiang Zemin reaffirmed that the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as well as the overall strategic goals, remain unchanged. This includes the principle of focusing on economic construction while adhering to the four cardinal principles, the policy of reform and opening up, and the concept of "one country, two systems."

General Secretary Jiang Zemin and the members of the Standing Committee of the Politburo answered more than 20 questions from 19 Chinese and foreign journalists during the press conference. The questions covered a wide range of topics, including party building, democratic and legal system construction, anti-corruption efforts, political and economic system reforms, cultural policies, the fight against pornography and cultural exchanges with the outside world, foreign policy, and relations between the mainland and Taiwan and Hong Kong.

The press conference, originally scheduled to last one and a half hours, lasted nearly two hours.
