	Bacterial Leaching

	As early as the 1950s, some foreign scientists conducted experiments using the catalytic action of certain bacteria to dissolve metals from ores and extract them. It is reported that American scientists were the first to successfully experiment with this method. Later, some mines in the Soviet Union, Canada, and Japan also conducted experiments and achieved success. Scientists discovered that in the ore layers, there are some bacteria that are resistant to metal ions and can separate metal and sulfur ions from sulfide ores. These bacteria can absorb sulfur compounds into their cells and oxidize them, turning them into solvents or oxidizers. Essentially, this method uses bacteria to leach metals from ores, hence the term "bacterial leaching."

	This technology is simpler and more efficient than traditional methods and can reduce air pollution. Traditional methods use acid, sodium cyanide, and other chemical products for leaching. For example, using acid to leach copper from chalcopyrite only yields a small amount of copper, while using bacterial leaching can increase the copper leaching rate to 30-40%.

	The bacterial strain is the key to applying this technology. Therefore, scientists pay great attention to discovering leaching bacteria. In the 1950s, American scientists discovered that sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and iron-oxidizing bacteria can leach copper from copper sulfide ores. In 1984, scientists from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology in the United States discovered a type of bacteria that feeds on sulfur ions. It can be used to remove sulfur from coal and extract valuable or toxic metals from some waste liquids.

	Scientists from Canada, the Soviet Union, and China have also discovered some leaching bacteria. These bacteria can survive in environments with many metals such as arsenic, lead, copper, and zinc, but they grow slowly. For this reason, researchers from the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology are studying ways to use genetic engineering to alter some characteristics of these bacteria to cultivate high-efficiency leaching bacterial strains. In 1984, molecular biologist Homer from General Electric in the United States separated different plasmids (a type of self-replicating deoxyribonucleic acid molecule) from a uranium-resistant bacterial strain. However, this bacterium reproduces slowly. He then transferred this plasmid into E. coli for asexual reproduction, allowing it to multiply rapidly in this fast-growing organism (E. coli). Microbiologist Rowlands from the University of Cape Town in South Africa also separated three plasmids from an arsenic-resistant strain. He is trying to isolate arsenic-resistant plasmid genes to enhance the arsenic resistance of the bacterial strain. Some mines in the United States have already used these bacteria for mining. It can be said that genetic engineering may cultivate new bacterial strains, accelerating the development of bacterial metallurgy technology.

	Progress in Bacterial Copper Mining

	Bacterial leaching technology was first applied to copper mining. According to statistics from 20 copper mines worldwide, the annual production of copper using bacterial leaching has reached tens of millions of tons. In the United States alone, the copper produced by bacterial leaching accounts for more than 10% of the national output. The Kennecott Copper Corporation in the United States built a heap leaching and replacement plant with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons of sponge copper, with an investment of only $20 million, which is only 1/10 of the conventional investment. The Sumitomo Metal Mining Company in Japan began industrial research on "wet copper refining using microorganisms" two or three years ago. This method uses sulfur-reducing bacteria to refine copper. The company can refine copper from low-grade ores using this technology, which increases the recovery rate of copper content compared to the past dry refining method using smelting furnaces, reduces refining costs, and almost eliminates the need for labor. The Sumitomo Metal Mining Company organized researchers to conduct research, with the core topic being to shorten the cultivation and processing time of bacteria, and through genetic engineering, discover or cultivate new "sulfur-reducing bacteria" with stronger sulfur or iron oxidation capabilities.

	Scientists have found that for general low-grade copper mines, bacterial leaching can significantly increase the leaching rate, making full use of mine resources. Therefore, this technology has received widespread attention. Some copper mines in China have also applied this advanced technology to the mining industry (including bacterial leaching experiments for copper, uranium, manganese, and cobalt), and have achieved success.

　　采矿技术的革命——
　　细菌采矿
　　卢继传
    也许人们不了解人眼见不到的细菌能够提取金属，然而，这是千真万确的事实。今天，细菌或微生物正在使采矿技术发生一场革命。
            细菌浸矿
    早在50年代，国外有人进行了试验，即利用某些细菌的催化作用，把矿石中的金属溶解出来，从中提取。据报道，美国科学家首先试验成功。后来，苏联、加拿大和日本等国的一些矿山也进行了试验，并获得成功。科学家发现，在矿石层中生存着一些细菌，对金属离子有抗毒性，可将硫化物矿石中的金属和硫离子分开。这些细菌可以把硫化物吸入细胞内加以氧化，使之成为溶剂或氧化剂。实质上是利用细菌把矿石中的金属浸出来，故称此技术为“细菌浸矿”。
    这种技术比传统技术简单、效率高，又能降低空气污染。所谓传统技术是利用酸、氰化钠等化工产品来浸矿，如用酸浸黄铜矿，只能浸出很少的铜，利用细菌浸矿，铜的浸出率可提高到30—40％。
    菌种是应用这项技术的关键。因此，科学家十分重视发现浸矿的细菌。50年代，美国科学家发现了氧化硫杆菌和氧化铁杆菌能够从硫化铜矿石中浸出铜。1984年美国新墨西哥州采矿技术研究所的科学家又发现一种以硫离子为食物的细菌。它可以用来除掉煤中的硫和从一些废液中提取有价值的或有毒的金属。
    加拿大、苏联和中国等国科学家也发现一些浸矿的细菌。这些细菌能够在许多金属如砷、铅以及铜、锌的环境中生存，但是它的生长很慢。为此，美国新墨西哥州采矿技术研究所的科研人员研究用基因工程方法改变这些细菌的一些特性，以培育高效率浸矿的优良细菌品种。美国通用电气公司分子生物学家霍姆于1984年已从1个抗铀菌株中分离出了不同的质粒（一种能够自主复制的脱氧核糖核酸分子）。但是，该菌繁殖得很慢。于是，他将这种质粒移入大肠杆菌里，进行无性繁殖，使它在这个快速生长的机体（大肠杆菌）中大量繁殖。南非开普敦大学微生物学家罗琳斯也从耐砷菌种中分离出3种质粒。他正在试着分离耐砷的质粒基因，以提高耐砷菌种机体的耐砷性能。美国一些矿山已试用这些细菌去采矿。可以认为，基因工程将可能培育一些新的菌种，加速细菌冶金技术的发展。
                    细菌采铜矿的进展
    细菌浸矿技术最早应用于采铜矿。据世界上20个铜矿山的统计，用细菌浸矿生产出来的铜，年产量已达二三十万吨。仅美国用细菌浸矿所生产的铜，已占全国产量的10％以上。美国肯尼考特铜矿公司建成的年产6万吨海绵铜的堆浸置换，投资费用仅为2000万美元，仅为常规投资费用的1／10。日本住友金属矿山公司已于两三年前就开始利用微生物进行“湿法提炼铜”的工业化研究。这个方法是利用硫酸还原菌来提炼铜。这家公司利用这项技术可以从低品位的矿石中提炼铜，与过去使用熔矿炉的干式提炼法相比，提高了铜成分的回收率，降低提炼成本等，而且采用这项技术几乎不需要劳力。日本住友金属矿山公司组织了科研人员进行研究，其中心课题是缩短细菌的培养与处理速度，通过基因工程发现或培育具有更强的氧化硫或铁能力的新“硫酸还原菌”。
    科学家发现，一般低品位的黄铜矿山，用细菌浸铜可大大提高浸出率，使矿山资源得到充分的开发利用。因此，这项技术受到广泛的重视。中国的一些铜矿山也把这项先进技术应用于采矿工业（包括铜、铀、锰、钴等金属的细菌浸出实验），并已取得成功。
