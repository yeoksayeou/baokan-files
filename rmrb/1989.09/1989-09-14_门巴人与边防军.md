The Mempa People and the Border Defense Troops

Open a map of Tibet and follow the Yarlung Zangbo River from west to east. At the big bend, you will find Motuo County, known as the "Island in the Sky." Here resides a brotherly ethnic group of the Chinese nation—the Mempa people.

During my visit here, I witnessed the dawn and twilight merging into a white night, listened to the symphony of pine trees and river water, tasted the delicious "bamboo tube rice" and scaleless fish, admired the magical and beautiful scenery of the tropical rainforest, and experienced the unique customs of the Mempa people. However, what touched my heart the most was the deep affection the Mempa people have for the People's Liberation Army. Due to the obstruction of snow-capped mountains, lack of roads, remote location, and limited information, the Mempa people have had little interaction with other ethnic groups in the mainland. In their hearts, the border defense troops stationed here have become the beloved and respected representatives of the motherland.

In the largest Mempa settlement, Diedong Village, the people excitedly told me: In the history of the Mempa people, many unprecedented new things are related to the soldiers.

	—The first Five-Star Red Flag was planted in Mempa Mountain Village by the PLA. From then on, the Mempa people, who had been wandering in the snow-capped mountains and dense forests, settled down. With the help of the troops, they carried out democratic reforms and embarked on the broad road of socialism.

	—The first store was established by the PLA. In the past, the Mempa people were isolated from the world for generations. To buy daily necessities like salt and tea, or to sell local specialties, they had to cross the 4800-meter-high Duoxiongla Mountain to the north or the 1500-meter-high Mengbangla Mountain to the south, facing extremely dangerous journeys. After the troops entered the mountains, they purchased necessary items from Lhasa, Chengdu, and other places and built convenience stores in the villages.

	—The first school was founded by the PLA. The Mempa people only have their own language and no written script. In the past, they relied on carving wood and tying knots to record events. To help them escape darkness and suffering and move towards brightness and happiness, the troops voluntarily vacated their barracks, provided teaching materials, assigned teachers, and established a Mempa school in the primitive forest.

	—The first power station was built with the help of the PLA. The troops crossed mountains and valleys, surveyed water sources, selected the construction site, endured scorching heat and bitter cold, and built a small hydroelectric power station. This solved the Mempa people's electricity needs for grinding, sawing, and threshing, and many Mempa families also started using electric lights. Now, the Mempa Mountain Village no longer relies on butter lamps and pine resin for lighting.

	—The first mule track was built by the PLA. Here, thorns and boulders abound, and turbulent streams flow across the path, making it extremely difficult. The soldiers overcame various challenges, blasted through the "Tiger's Mouth," built a plank road, and constructed an "economic road" on the steep Duoxiongla Mountain, connecting it to the mainland's transportation lines.

	—The first hospital was established with the help of the PLA. In the past, the Mempa Mountain Village lacked medical care and medicines. When infectious diseases broke out, the three lords would burn, bury alive, or drive the sick into the deep mountains to die. After the troops entered the mountains, they promptly treated the Mempa people's illnesses, trained medical personnel, and built the "Red Star Hospital," which was highly praised by the Mempa people.

In the past two years, the border defense troops stationed here have jointly built a civilized village with the Mempa people, further deepening the bond between the soldiers and the people. The border defense troops established a "poverty alleviation and enrichment" group, held training classes, taught scientific knowledge, and guided the masses in scientific farming and diversified operations. Officers and soldiers brought rice, corn, and vegetable seeds from their hometowns, teaching the Mempa people how to cultivate them. Last year, Motuo County achieved the best harvest in its history. The troops' film team traversed dense forests, climbed cliffs, crossed streams, and walked over suspension bridges to show movies and videos to the people. The "Learn from Lei Feng" group often went deep into the villages to cut hair, carry water, treat illnesses, and take care of the elderly. The soldiers cherish and care for the Mempa people, and the Mempa people also love the PLA. Last year, when the troops were repairing their positions, the people from Derong, Beibeng, and Gelin villages all volunteered to help the troops carry wood, dig trenches, and build shelters, enabling the troops to complete their combat readiness construction ahead of schedule. When the troops were training, they couldn't harvest the corn in time, so more than 100 local people spontaneously came to help with the harvest.

Today, there is a song in the village: "The Communist Party is the red sun, shining over the Mempa villages, warming the hearts of the Mempa people. The PLA is the bright moon, driving away demons and dispelling darkness, making the Mempa people joyful..."

　　门巴人与边防军
　　杨辉林
    翻开西藏地图，顺着雅鲁藏布江由西向东看，大拐弯处便是素有“高原孤岛”之称的墨脱县，这里住着祖国民族大家庭中的一个兄弟民族——门巴族。
    在这里采访，笔者看过曙色和晚霞相连的白夜奇景，听过松涛与江水交响的天然音乐，尝过“竹筒饭”和无鳞鱼的美味，欣赏过热带雨林神奇瑰丽的风光，领略过门巴族奇异的风土人情，但最拨人心弦的还是门巴族人民对解放军的深情厚谊。由于雪山阻隔，不通公路，驻地偏僻，信息闭塞，门巴人民和祖国内地的兄弟民族交往不多。在他们的心目中，常年驻在这里的边防军便成了祖国可亲可敬的代表。
    在门巴族最大的聚居地——地东村，人们激动地对我说：在门巴族的历史上，有许多破天荒的新事都与子弟兵有关。
    ——第一面五星红旗是解放军插进门巴山村的。从那时起，在雪山密林中流浪的门巴人定居了。在部队的帮助下，进行了民主改革，走上了社会主义康庄大道。
    ——第一个商店是解放军筹建的。过去，门巴人民世代与世隔绝。人们要买盐巴、茶叶等日用品和出售土特产品，往北要翻4800米的多雄拉山，往南要越1500米的更邦拉山，路途十分艰险。部队进山后，便从林芝、拉萨、成都等地采购门巴人民生活的必需品，在村寨建起了便民商店。
    ——第一所学校是解放军创办的。门巴族只有本民族的语言，没有本民族的文字，过去长期靠刻木结绳记事。为了帮助他们摆脱黑暗、痛苦，走向光明、幸福，部队主动腾出营房，添置教具，抽调教师，在原始森林里办起了门巴学校。
    ——第一座发电站是解放军帮助修建的。部队翻山越岭，勘测水源，选定建站地点，斗酷暑，战严寒，建立一座小水电站，解决了门巴人电磨、电锯、脱粒等的用电困难，不少门巴人家里也用上了电灯。现在门巴山村已不再靠酥油、松节照明了。
    ——第一条骡马道是解放军修筑的。这里荆棘丛生、乱石嶙峋、浊流横溢，困难重重，暴雨、飞雪、骄阳变幻莫测。子弟兵战胜各种困难，凿通“老虎嘴”，架通栈道，在陡峭的多雄拉山上修出了一条通向门巴山村的“经济之路”，使它与祖国内地运输线相连。
    ——第一家医院是在解放军的帮助下建立的。昔日门巴山村缺医少药，遇到传染病流行时，三大领主就将病人焚烧、活埋或赶进深山老林困死。部队进山后，及时为门巴人民诊治疾病，培训卫生人员，兴建“红星医院”，深受门巴人民赞扬。
    近两年，驻守在这里的边防军，和门巴人民共建文明村，进一步增进了军民鱼水之情。边防部队成立了“扶贫助富”小组，举办培训班，传授科学知识，指导群众科学种田和发展多种经营；干部战士从家乡带来水稻、玉米、蔬菜良种，教他们耕种，去年，墨脱县的庄稼获得历史上最好的收成；部队电影组穿密林、攀山崖、涉溪流、过吊桥为群众放电影和录相；“学雷锋”小组经常深入村寨理发、背水、治病，照顾老人。子弟兵爱护、关心门巴人民，门巴人民也热爱解放军。去年，部队整修阵地，德儿功、背崩、格林村的群众全体出动，帮助部队抬木料、挖工事、修掩体，使部队提前完成了战备施工任务。部队训练紧，玉米成熟时一下子收不完，当地100多名群众自发来到部队帮助抢收。
    今天，寨里有这样一首歌：“共产党啊红太阳，照在门巴村寨，暖在门巴人心房。解放军啊明月亮，赶走魔鬼驱黑暗，门巴人民喜洋洋……”
