Host County Region Takes Concrete Steps to Reduce Farmers' Burdens

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hefei on September 3rd, the Host County Region of Anhui Province has taken the initiative to reduce farmers' burdens as a key part of its clean governance campaign. It has resolutely curbed the misuse of public funds for extravagant banquets and streamlined organizations, dismissing excess personnel hired by townships and villages and contract teachers, thereby initially reducing the long-standing heavy burdens on farmers. Preliminary statistics show that over the past two months, farmers' burdens have been reduced from the originally planned 96.317 million yuan to 67.109 million yuan, with per capita levies decreasing by 30.2%.

	Reducing farmers' burdens has always been a major concern for farmers. After this summer's harvest, the Host County Party Committee and Administrative Office dispatched five investigation teams to conduct in-depth surveys in rural households. They found that the root causes of farmers' heavy burdens were twofold: first, departments and grassroots levels arbitrarily increased personnel, leading to overstaffing; second, excessive banqueting, waste, and embezzlement.

	In response to these issues, the Host County Party Committee and Administrative Office issued the "Urgent Notice on Reducing Farmers' Burdens" and the "Several Regulations on Stopping the Use of Public Funds for Extravagant Banquets." They are determined to implement measures to reduce farmers' burdens effectively.

	To curb the trend of personnel expansion, the Host County Party Committee and Administrative Office decided that all contract teachers hired after 1978 without approval from the county education authorities would undergo a comprehensive review. All excess personnel hired by townships and districts would be dismissed. So far, nearly 10,000 excess personnel have been dismissed.

	Facing the persistent problem of extravagant banqueting, the Host County Party Committee and Administrative Office have stipulated that no department is allowed to use public funds for banqueting, entertaining, or gift-giving for any reason. They also require all counties and cities to conduct a comprehensive review of the use of collective funds from 1986 to 1988. It is stipulated that all funds collected by townships in the future will be managed by the township finance department.

    把刹吃喝风和人员膨胀风列入廉政内容
    宿县地区切实减轻农民负担
    据新华社合肥9月3日电（通讯员刘杰、记者于杰）安徽省宿县地区把减轻农民负担作为廉政建设的大事来抓，坚决刹住用公款大吃大喝的歪风，精简机构，裁减超编招聘的乡村干部和民办教师，使屡减不轻的农民负担初步得到削减。据初步统计，两个多月来，农民负担由原计划的9631.7万元，减少到6710.9万元，人均提留减少30.2％。
    减轻农民负担一直是农民关心的事，今年夏收后，宿县地委、行署派出五个调查组，深入农户，摸底调查，发现造成农民负担的根本原因，一是部门及基层乱开口子，使人员超编。二是吃喝浪费及贪污挪用。
    针对这些情况，地委、行署发出了《关于减轻农民负担的紧急通知》，作出了《关于制止用公款大吃大喝的若干规定》，下决心把减轻农民负担落到实处。
    为了刹住人员膨胀风，地委、行署决定，凡1978年后，未经县教育主管部门批准的民师要进行一次全面清理，凡超编聘用的区乡人员坚决辞退。到目前为止，已裁减超编人员近万人。
    面对屡禁不止的吃喝风，地委、行署规定任何部门不得以任何理由用公款吃喝招待，请客送礼，同时，并要求各县市对1986—1988年以来集体提留款使用情况进行一次全面清理，规定今后凡乡提留的各项资金一律由乡财政管理。
