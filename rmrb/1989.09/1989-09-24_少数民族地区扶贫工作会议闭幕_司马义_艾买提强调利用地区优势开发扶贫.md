National Minority Region Poverty Alleviation Work Conference Concludes

Sima Yi·Aimaiti Emphasizes Utilizing Regional Advantages for Poverty Alleviation Development

Beijing, September 23 (Xinhua) — The national conference on poverty alleviation in minority regions concluded this morning in Beijing.

Sima Yi·Aimaiti, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and Minister of the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, spoke at the meeting. He emphasized that all regions should pay great attention to poverty alleviation work in minority areas, placing this work in a crucial position for national unity, progress, and economic balanced development. He stressed the need to support impoverished regions with manpower, material resources, and financial aid, striving to achieve tangible results and ensure that the poor population can solve their basic livelihood problems in a timely manner. He called on impoverished regions to foster a spirit of hard work, overcome the mentality of relying on others, and use their own hands and wisdom to improve production conditions, change their backward appearance, overcome poverty, and move towards prosperity.

He said that efforts should be made to significantly improve the production conditions in minority impoverished regions. Otherwise, even if the basic livelihood problems are temporarily solved, production and living conditions will be difficult to maintain stability. He advocated for actively utilizing the advantages of minority impoverished regions for development-oriented poverty alleviation. Under the premise of ensuring grain production, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions, leverage strengths, and avoid weaknesses, rationally adjust the industrial structure, and actively develop agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, mining, hydropower, tourism, and other resources. He also proposed that in poverty alleviation work, attention should be paid to the intellectual development of minority impoverished regions.

    少数民族地区扶贫工作会议闭幕
    司马义·艾买提强调利用地区优势开发扶贫
    本报北京9月23日讯　本报记者袁建达、新华社记者格来：全国少数民族地区开发扶贫工作会议今天上午在这里闭幕。
    全国政协副主席、国家民委主任司马义·艾买提在会上讲话时提出，各地要十分重视少数民族地区的扶贫工作，要把这项工作摆到事关民族团结进步和经济协调发展的重要位置上，从人力、物力、财力上扶持贫困地区，力求多办实事，使贫困群众定期解决温饱问题。贫困地区要发扬艰苦奋斗精神，克服等、靠、要的依赖思想，依靠自己的双手和智慧，改变生产条件，改变落后面貌，摆脱贫困，走向富裕。
    他说，要大力改善少数民族贫困地区的生产条件，否则，即使暂时解决了温饱问题，生产生活也是很难保持稳定的。要积极利用少数民族贫困地区优势进行开发性扶贫，在保证粮食生产的前提下，因地制宜，扬长避短，合理调整产业结构，积极进行农、林、牧、矿、水电、旅游等资源的开发利用，开展多种经营。他还提出，在扶贫工作中要注重少数民族贫困地区的智力开发。
