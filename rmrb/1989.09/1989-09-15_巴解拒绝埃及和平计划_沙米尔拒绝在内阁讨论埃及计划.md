The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) has rejected Egypt's peace plan. Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has refused to discuss the Egyptian plan in the cabinet.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, September 14 - According to the Palestine News Agency, the PLO Executive Committee concluded a meeting held here from September 10 to 12 and issued a statement saying that it insists on the Palestinian peace initiative.

	The statement said the Executive Committee reaffirmed its readiness to participate in any preparatory activities for an international peace conference in the Middle East, but it would not allow any party to stand above it or force it to abandon the Palestinian peace initiative.

	Observers believe that this statement indicates that the PLO has rejected Egypt's 10-point plan.

	The Executive Committee emphasized the importance of Arab collective action to implement the decisions of the Arab Summit and support the Palestinian uprising through various means.

	The Executive Committee also proposed to convene a meeting of the PLO Central Committee in mid-October.

	Xinhua News Agency, Tunis, September 14 - According to the African News Agency in Tunis, citing sources close to the Israeli cabinet, Israeli Prime Minister and Likud leader Yitzhak Shamir refused on September 13 to discuss Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's 10-point peace plan in the cabinet meeting.

	At the start of the cabinet meeting attended by 12 ministers from the Labor Party and the Likud, Shamir emphasized that there was no reason to discuss Egypt's plan because it had not been officially presented to Israel.

	According to the source, before this cabinet meeting, Foreign Minister Arens, Defense Minister Rabin, and Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Peres had discussed the plan, but they did not disclose the results of the discussion.

	Shamir, Arens (Likud), and Rabin (Labor) have recently stated that they oppose discussing the plan within the government, and Israel insists on the Shamir plan proposed in May.

	However, Peres (Labor) believes that the 10-point plan can serve as a basis for negotiations with a Palestinian delegation to organize elections in the occupied territories.

　　巴解拒绝埃及和平计划
　　沙米尔拒绝在内阁讨论埃及计划
    新华社突尼斯9月14日电　据巴勒斯坦通讯社报道，巴解组织执委会10日至12日在这里召开的会议结束后发表一项公报说，它坚持巴勒斯坦和平倡议。
    公报说，执委会重申准备参加为召开中东和平国际会议的任何准备活动，但它将不许任何一方凌驾于它之上或迫使它放弃巴勒斯坦和平倡议。
    观察家认为，这项声明表明，巴解组织拒绝了埃及提出的10点计划。
    执委会强调阿拉伯共同行动的重要性，以实施阿拉伯首脑特别会议的决议和通过各种手段来支持巴勒斯坦起义。
    执委会还建议10月中旬召开巴解组织中央委员会会议。
    新华社突尼斯9月14日电　据突尼斯非洲通讯社援引接近以色列内阁人士的话报道，以色列总理、利库德集团领导人沙米尔13日拒绝在内阁会议上讨论埃及总统穆巴拉克的10点和平计划。
    在由12名工党和利库德集团部长出席的内阁会议开始时，沙米尔就强调指出，没有理由讨论埃及的这一计划，因为它还没有正式向以色列提出。
    据这位人士说，在这次内阁会议前不久，外长阿伦斯、国防部长拉宾和副总理兼财政部长佩雷斯已讨论了这一计划，但他们未透露讨论结果。
    沙米尔、阿伦斯（利库德集团）和拉宾（工党）最近几天说，他们反对在政府内讨论这一计划，以色列坚持5月提出的沙米尔计划。
    但是，佩雷斯（工党）认为10点计划可以作为同一个巴勒斯坦代表团谈判的基础，以便在被占领土组织选举。
