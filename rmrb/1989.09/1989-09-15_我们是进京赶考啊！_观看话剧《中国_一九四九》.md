In the golden autumn, I watched the Total Political Department Drama Troupe's production of the play *China, 1949*, created to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation.

The play's outstanding artistic feature is the organic combination of poetic symbolism and realistic portrayal. As the curtain opens, the stage set is an abstract horseshoe-shaped bridge, a piano, and eight upright pillars. Through the changing angles and positions of the pillars, different scenes and backgrounds are reflected. Sometimes it shows the wavering and collapsing of the old China under the storm of the people's war; sometimes it shows the majestic new China standing tall and firm, unshakable. In this way, the play's character is sometimes fresh and distant, sometimes intense and profound, weaving together a symphony of the People's Republic. This opens up a new path for the combination of realism and abstraction in drama.

The play reenacts the historical period from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China going to Beijing to the founding of the People's Republic of China. There are more than 30 characters from the Kuomintang, the Communist Party, the Democratic Parties, and famous patriots. The actors' performances are lively and vivid. When portraying our party's leaders, they are depicted as both leaders and ordinary people, with joy at the prospect of victory and debates when opinions differ.

The play delicately describes the deep camaraderie formed between Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Ren Bishi during their long struggle. The key to the victory of the Chinese revolution lies in having such a strong collective leadership core. They support each other, complement each other, trust each other, and make up for each other's shortcomings, achieving invincibility. The formation of this collective is not only the will of the party and the people but is also formed, consolidated, and ultimately established in the hearts of the entire party, the army, and the people through long historical practice. This is the true history of the Chinese revolution.

The party's "Seventh Congress" advocated "holding fast to the truth and correcting errors," which is vividly embodied in them. This spirit is one of our great treasures of victory.

The characters in the play speak concisely, and a few words accurately reflect the personalities of the characters, leaving the audience with profound enlightenment. For example, when entering Beijing, Chairman Mao said, "We are going to Beijing to take an exam!" Ren Bishi said, "...Yes, the people have raised us, and we Communists must certainly live up to the people."

The play also realistically portrays Chiang Kai-shek's complex emotions as he fled to Taiwan with the collapse of his regime.

The play's initial success is the result of the relentless efforts of the directors and actors in pursuing historical authenticity, artistic performance, and theatrical innovation. Of course, the play still has room for improvement in both artistic and ideological content. For example, there is much more that can be portrayed between Mao Zedong and his son, and between Chiang Kai-shek and his son. This is not only a realistic portrayal of history but also a great lesson for future generations.

The sound has faded, but the meaning lingers: Our republic has gone through forty springs and autumns. Facing those who bravely sacrificed their lives for the establishment of New China; facing those founding fathers who have passed away; facing the people who raised us; facing the unending history of the Chinese nation for five thousand years, what should we say?

In the distant, distant sky, my heart echoes:

We are going to Beijing to take an exam!

The people have raised us, and we Communists must certainly live up to the people!...

    “我们是进京赶考啊！”
　　——观看话剧《中国·一九四九》
　　任远远
　  金秋时节，观看了总政话剧团为迎接建国40周年创作演出的话剧《中国·1949》。
    这台话剧突出的艺术特色是，诗意象征与生活再现的有机结合。拉开大幕，舞台景观虽只是抽象的一座马蹄形的桥，一架钢琴和八根通天立柱。但通过立柱不同的角度和位置变换，反映出不同场次的背景和内容。它倾斜和直立的组合排列，时而表现出在人民战争的风雨中摇摇欲堕国民党统治的旧中国将要坍塌；时而表现出曙光中的新中国的雄伟大厦顶天立地，坚不可摧。正是这样，使得本剧的品格，时而清新淡远，时而浓烈深邃，交织成一首人民共和国的交响诗。为话剧的写实与抽象的结合另辟了一条新路。
    这出戏再现的是中共中央前往北平至中华人民共和国成立的这段历史。出场的国共两党、民主党派、爱国知名人士有30余人。演员的表演不落俗套，生动活泼。表现我党领袖人物时，把他们塑造成既是领袖，又是普通人，他们有胜利在望时的喜悦，也有意见不一时的争论。
    剧作对毛泽东、朱德、刘少奇、周恩来、任弼时之间在长期战斗历程中形成了的战斗情谊作了细腻的描写。中国革命胜利的关键就在于有了这样一个坚强的集体领导核心，他们互相支持，互相补充，互相信任，取长补短缺一不可，从而达到了百战百胜的境地。这个集体的形成，不光是党心民意之所向，而是在长期的历史实践中而结合，而形成，而巩固并最终在全党全军全国人民中树立起来的，这就是中国革命的真正历史。
    党的“七大”提倡的“坚持真理，修正错误”，在他们身上得以鲜明的体现。这种精神是我们胜利的一大法宝。
    该剧人物语言简练，寥寥数语，就十分准确地反映出人物的性格特征给观众留下了回味无穷的启迪，如进北平时毛主席说：“我们进北平，是进京赶考啊！”任弼时则说：“……是啊，人民养育了我们，我们共产党可一定要对得起人民呀。”
    剧中对蒋介石“国破家离”逃往台湾时的复杂心情，刻画得也很真实可信。
    该剧所以能初演成功，是编导、演员在追求历史的真实性、表演的艺术性、话剧革新上所做不懈努力的结果。当然，此剧在艺术上，思想内容上也都还有提高的可能，如在毛泽东父子，蒋介石父子间有很多戏可演，这不仅是历史的写实，同时对后人也将很有教益。
    声已尽而意犹存：我们共和国已经度过了四十个春秋，面对那些为建立新中国而英勇牺牲了的英灵；面对那些作古的开国元勋，面对那些养育我们的人民，面对中华民族上下五千年的不朽历史，我们……，我们又该说些什么呢？
    在很远，很远的天地之间，我的心扉得到了回声：
    我们进北平，是进京赶考啊！
    人民养育了我们，我们共产党一定要对得起人民呀！……（附图片）
