Reporters Li Jingwei and Correspondent Shi Fei report from Harare, September 7th: On September 6th, South Africa held simultaneous elections for its three chambers: the White, Coloured, and Indian Parliaments. The ruling National Party secured 93 out of 166 seats, surpassing the halfway mark by 9 seats, ensuring it will continue to form the government.

Since coming to power in 1948, this election marked the fewest seats the National Party has ever won. The reduction in the National Party's seats has deep political roots. Primarily, some whites believe the National Party has been ineffective in reforming the apartheid system and have thus turned to the more radical Democratic Party, hoping to end racial oppression sooner. Secondly, some conservative whites oppose the National Party's internal and external policies, insisting on maintaining the apartheid system, and have instead supported the far-right Conservative Party. Additionally, power struggles within the National Party's leadership, particularly the infighting between former President P.W. Botha and the current National Party Chairman and Acting President F.W. de Klerk, have damaged the party's reputation among some whites, leading to a loss of trust. Due to these reasons, as of now, the National Party has secured 30 fewer seats than in the previous election. The Democratic Party increased from 20 to 33 seats, while the Conservative Party rose from 22 to 39 seats.

It was also reported that on the day before the election, over 3 million blacks staged a two-day nationwide strike, protesting their exclusion from the election and demanding the abolition of the apartheid system.

    南非国民党在大选中获胜
    黑人抗议被排斥在选举外
    本报哈拉雷9月7日电  记者李景卫、通讯员史非报道：9月6日，南非白人、有色人和印度人三个议院同时举行大选。执政的国民党在166个议席中获93席，超过半数9席，将组阁继续执政。
    自1948年上台以来，这次选举是国民党获得议席最少的一次。国民党议席的减少有着深刻的政治原因。主要是一些白人认为国民党在“改革”种族隔离制度方面不力，无所作为。因此，这些人投靠激进的民主党，希望早日结束种族主义统治。其次是部分思想保守的白人不同意国民党内外政策，坚持种族隔离制度，转而支持极右的保守党。另外，国民党高层出现的权力之争，特别是今年以来前总统博塔和现国民党主席、代总统德克勒克之间的勾心斗角，影响了国民党在部分白人中的声望，使其失去信任。鉴于上述原因，到目前为止，国民党获得的议席数比上届大选少30席。民主党由20席增至33席，保守党由22席增至39席。
    另据报道，大选前的一天，300多万黑人又举行了为期两天的全国总罢工，抗议被排斥在大选之外，要求废除种族隔离制度。
