The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement today regarding the resolution on China passed by the 41st session of the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities. The full text of the statement is as follows:

On August 31, the 41st session of the United Nations Sub-Commission on the Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities, held in Geneva, passed a resolution on China under the instigation and manipulation of a few Western members. This resolution blatantly interferes in China's internal affairs and attempts to exert pressure on China. The Chinese government firmly opposes this so-called resolution, which deviates from the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter and violates the norms of international relations, and considers it illegal and invalid.

This spring and summer, the events in Beijing were a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil instigated by a small number of individuals in collusion with anti-China forces abroad, who exploited student movements to launch a counter-revolutionary rebellion aimed at overthrowing the government of the People's Republic of China and the socialist system established by the Constitution. The Chinese government, having endured to the limit, took decisive measures to quell the rebellion, maintain law and order, and protect the lives and property of the vast majority of the people. This is completely legal, justified, and necessary, and falls within the sovereignty of our country. No foreign country, international organization, or individual has the right to interfere.

The Chinese government has always attached great importance to human rights. Our Constitution and laws guarantee the extensive rights of all ethnic groups, including individual and various other rights. The government's action to quell the rebellion was precisely to uphold the basic human rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of the people.

The Chinese government has consistently adopted an educational approach and a tolerant attitude towards the general students and masses who participated in the illegal demonstrations. Only a very small number of criminals who violated the law have been punished according to the law. Every sovereign government has the responsibility to uphold the dignity of the law.

Currently, social order in Beijing and across the country has returned to normal, and the situation is stable. China will continue to unswervingly implement an independent and peaceful foreign policy. We are willing to continue to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and promote international cooperation.

Any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs will inevitably end in complete failure.

    就联合国人权委员会下属一小组会议通过有关中国决议
    我外交部发言人发表声明
    强调中国政府认为这项决议是非法无效的
    新华社北京9月2日电　外交部发言人今天就联合国防止歧视和保护少数小组委员会第41届会议通过有关中国的决议一事发表声明，全文如下：
    8月31日，在日内瓦举行的联合国人权委员会下属的防止歧视和保护少数小组委员会第41届会议，在少数西方委员的策划和鼓动下，通过了一项有关中国的决议。这项决议公然干涉中国内政，企图对中国施加压力。对于这一背离联合国宪章的宗旨和原则、违反国际关系准则的所谓决议，中国政府坚决反对并认为它是非法的，无效的。
    今年春夏之交，在北京发生的事件是极少数人与外国反华势力相勾结，利用学潮掀起的一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，并进而发展成为诉诸暴力行动和恐怖手段、以推翻中华人民共和国政府和宪法规定的社会主义制度为目的的反革命暴乱。中国政府在忍无可忍的情况下，采取果断措施平息暴乱，维护法律和秩序，保护广大人民群众的生命和财产安全，这是完全合法的、正当的和必要的，是我国主权范围内的事，任何外国、国际组织或个人均无权干涉。
    中国政府一向重视人权。我国宪法和法律保障各族人民享有广泛的权利，包括个人和各种权利。我国政府平息暴乱也正是为了维护绝大多数人民的基本人权与自由。
    中国政府对一般参加非法游行的学生和群众，始终执行教育的方针，采取宽容的态度。依法受到惩处的只是极少数触犯刑律的犯罪分子。任何一个主权国家政府都有责任维护法律的尊严。
    现在，北京和全国的社会秩序已经恢复正常，局势稳定。中国将继续坚定不移地执行独立自主的和平外交政策。我们愿意在和平共处五项原则的基础上，继续发展与世界各国的友好关系，促进国际合作。
    任何妄图干涉中国内政的行径都必将以彻底失败而告终。
