A survey conducted by the urban survey team of Hengyang City in the first half of 1989 revealed that the average worker's social burden amounted to 132.74 yuan (excluding national savings bonds), equivalent to 0.8 months' salary for an average-income worker. If we consider the average monthly living expenses of 123.73 yuan, each worker can support 1.34 people (including themselves). After deducting the social burden, each worker can only support 1.16 people (including themselves).

The state's difficulties are understandable, and it is reasonable to ask people to subscribe to bonds. However, various departments and units use different methods to impose additional burdens, making it unbearable for workers. The survey found that there are as many as 23 types of social burden projects for workers, mainly including various fundraising activities, education funds, respecting the elderly and helping the disabled, donations to disaster-stricken areas, donations to five-guarantee households, scholarship donations, health fees, student sponsorship fees, canteen sponsorship, kindergarten and school enrollment sponsorship, graduation ceremony sponsorship, school repair sponsorship, internal bonds, public security fees, afforestation fees, mandatory savings, mandatory personal insurance, moral education fees, and rat extermination fees. The list goes on and on.

Some donations are collected layer by layer. For example, the education fund is regulated by the city to be 1% of the monthly salary, but some schools privately collect 8-10 yuan each, making parents complain bitterly. Afforestation is done once a year, and now 5 yuan can be used to plant a tree to fulfill the afforestation task. Some units deduct 5 yuan per person from the salary for this purpose, which is puzzling. Workers sigh: there are endless holes to fill and endless fees to pay, what can one do?

    五花八门的社会负担
    ——职工社会负担情况调查
    集资、赞助、捐赠……名目繁多，已成为人们生活中一大负担。为了弄清职工的社会负担情况，衡阳市城调队在市区抽样调查了各种不同类型的职工200人。调查结果表明：1989年上半年职工人均社会负担132.74元（不含国库券），相当于中等收入职工的0.8个月的工资额。如按上半年人均月生活费支出123.73元计，每一职工能负担1.34人（含本人），扣除社会负担金额，则平均每一职工只能负担1.16人（含本人）。
    国家困难，名正言顺地要人们认购券款，情在理中。伤脑筋的是各部门、各单位采用各种不同手段，节外生枝地乱收乱要，卡得职工受不了。据调查，职工社会负担项目竟达23种之多，主要有各种集资、教育基金、敬老助残、捐赠灾区、捐赠五保户、捐赠奖学金、卫生费、学生代培费、食堂赞助、入托入学赞助、毕业典礼赞助、学校维修赞助、内部债券、治安费、植树造林费、强制性储蓄、强制性人身保险、品德教育费、灭鼠费……真是五花八门。一些捐赠层层征收，如教育基金市规定职工按月工资1％提缴，而一些学校又私自收8—10元不等，学生家长叫苦不迭。植树造林每年一次，现在只要5元一棵树，就可以抵消造林任务，一些单位按每人5元钱从工资扣除，如此造林，令人费解。职工们叹息说：填不满的大小洞，缴不完的各种费，奈何，莫奈何！
