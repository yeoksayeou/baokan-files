Recently, the issue of global economic grouping has become a hot topic in academic circles. Some scholars, in their discussions, often focus only on the local benefits brought by grouping, while ignoring its negative aspects. I believe it is necessary to point out that global economic grouping has many adverse effects on the development of the world economy. Below, I will briefly discuss a few aspects.

	The Adverse Impact on International Trade

	It is well known that within an economic grouping, due to the mutual reduction or even elimination of tariffs and non-tariff barriers among member countries, it often promotes the rapid growth of intra-group trade. However, at the same time, because these preferential measures within the economic grouping are exclusive, a significant portion of the growth in intra-group trade comes at the expense of suppressing trade with non-member countries. This inevitably affects the normal development of international trade. For example, taking the European Economic Community as an example, in the short span of 20 years from 1958 to 1980, the mutual exports of the member countries increased from $686 million to $34.69 billion, growing by 48.5 times, with an average annual growth rate of 19%. However, during the same period, the proportion of non-member countries' exports to the Community in the Community's total imports generally declined. In 1958, the proportion of U.S. exports to the Community in the Community's total imports was still 11.4%, but by 1982, it had dropped to 8.6%. The situation for developing countries was similar. In 1958, this proportion was 30.3%, dropping to 22.2% in 1980, and further to 20.4% in 1982. From this, it can be seen that the rapid growth of intra-group trade indeed affects the development of trade with non-member countries.

	The Adverse Impact on International Division of Labor

	Due to the exclusivity of economic groupings, it is possible to erect tariff and non-tariff barriers, thereby affecting the normal development of trade with non-member countries and inevitably impacting the rationalization of international division of labor on a global scale. The agricultural trade of the European Community is a good example. The European Community, due to its high production costs for agricultural products, generally has prices higher than the world market. For example, in 1980, the price of wheat in the Community was 38% higher than the world market price, beef was 52% higher, and butter was 53% higher. For countries like West Germany, which have developed industrial production but a low self-sufficiency rate for agricultural products, whether from the perspective of the rational principle of international division of labor on a global scale or from the perspective of their own comparative advantages, they should export industrial products and import low-priced agricultural products from the world market. However, after the establishment of the Community, due to the implementation of agricultural policies, the import of low-priced agricultural products from outside the Community was restricted, resulting in these countries having to import agricultural products from the domestic market at prices higher than the world market. This division of labor, although beneficial to countries within the Community like France, Italy, and the Netherlands, which have relatively developed agriculture, protects backwardness and reduces global agricultural production efficiency. Therefore, from the perspective of the world economy, it cannot be said that this is a rational international division of labor.

	The Adverse Impact on Developing Countries Utilizing Foreign Capital

	What adverse impacts does the economic grouping of developed capitalist countries have on developing countries utilizing foreign capital? I believe the main impact is that it increases mutual investment among developed capitalist countries, while the amount of capital flowing into developing countries (especially direct investment) relatively decreases, thereby seriously affecting the sources of foreign capital for developing countries. This is because the economic grouping of developed capitalist countries adopts different trade policies for internal and external markets, thereby seriously hindering the export trade of some developed capitalist countries that are non-member states to this economic grouping (for example, the previously mentioned decline in the export share of the United States and Japan to the European Economic Community). In this situation, these countries often expand capital exports, especially direct capital exports, to build factories, produce, and sell locally, bypassing the tariff and non-tariff barriers of the economic grouping and sharing the benefits of tax-free circulation of products. Taking U.S. investment in the European Community as an example, after the establishment of the Community, U.S. export trade to the Community countries was seriously affected, and the market share quickly declined. To reverse the trend, the U.S. government strongly supported U.S. businessmen in investing and building factories within the Community to sell locally. Currently, the sales revenue of U.S.-owned enterprises within the Community has far exceeded the U.S. export of goods to the Community countries. Especially in recent years, due to the European Community's proposal to establish a unified European market by 1992, it has further stimulated a wave of U.S. corporate investment in Europe. In 1987, U.S. companies' investment in Europe to acquire companies and build factories reached $20.9 billion, 28 times that of 1982. Meanwhile, Japan's direct investment in the European Community has shown a similar trend. In 1988, there were 400 Japanese enterprises in the Community, an increase of 100 from 1987. The above facts show that the establishment of economic groupings among developed capitalist countries promotes their mutual investment, which is not conducive to the introduction of foreign capital by developing countries.

	The Adverse Impact on International Economic Coordination

	With the development of global economic grouping, future international economic coordination will gradually shift from coordination between countries to coordination between groupings. This change in the coordination subjects, on the one hand, brings favorable factors to international economic coordination, that is, once successful, its coverage will be very broad; but on the other hand, it also brings more difficulties to international economic coordination, making the coordination work extremely complex and arduous. This is because: first, due to differences in economic development levels and economic structures among member countries within a grouping, different economic interest structures are formed. Therefore, when international coordination does not adapt to the economic interest structures of various countries, it is inevitable that there will be countries that support and oppose, thus encountering great resistance in international coordination. Second, the establishment of economic groupings, on the one hand, strengthens the overall economic strength of the grouping and expands the market; on the other hand, it enhances the economic complementarity among member countries within the grouping and reduces their dependence on the external economy. Therefore, in international economic coordination activities, they have sufficient leverage to resist external pressure.

　　不能忽视世界经济集团化的不利影响
    张宇贤
    最近，世界经济集团化问题已成为学术界一个热门话题。一些学者在论述中往往只看到集团化所带来的局部利益，而忽视了它的消极因素。我认为，应该指出世界经济集团化对世界经济的发展有许多不利影响。下面就此略述几个方面。
            对国际贸易的不利影响
    众所周知，在经济集团内部，由于成员国之间相互削减甚至取消关税和非关税壁垒，因此，它常常能促进集团内部贸易的迅速增长。但与此同时，由于经济集团内部的这些优惠措施是具有排他性的，因此，集团内部贸易的增长有很大一部分是靠抑制与非成员国的贸易交往换来的，这样便不可避免地要影响到国际贸易的正常发展。如以欧洲经济共同体为例，在1958—1980年短短的20多年中，共同体成员国的相互出口从68.6亿美元增加到3469亿美元，增长了48.5倍，年平均增长率达19％。但与此同时，非成员国对共同体的出口占共同体进口总额的比重却普遍下降。1958年，美国对共同体的出口额在共同体进口总额中的比重还达到11.4％，但到1982年便下降为8.6％。发展中国家情况也是如此，1958年这一比重为30.3％，1980年下降为22.2％，1982年再降为20.4％。由此可见，集团内部贸易的迅速增长确实影响到它与非成员国贸易的发展。
            对国际分工的不利影响
    由于经济集团具有排他性，因此就有可能筑起关税和非关税壁垒，从而影响它和非成员国贸易的正常发展，也不可避免地要影响到世界范围内国际分工的合理化。欧洲共同体的农产品贸易就是一个很好的例子。欧洲共同体由于农产品的生产成本较高，其价格一般要高于世界市场的价格，例如，1980年共同体小麦价格就比世界市场价格高38％，牛肉高52％，黄油高53％。对于那些工业生产发达、农产品自给程度很低的国家如西德来说，无论是就世界范围内合理的国际分工原则而言，还是就这些国家本身的比较利益而言，都应该是它们向外出口工业品，而从世界市场进口价格低廉的农产品。但是，共同体成立后，由于农业政策的实施，限制了共同体外廉价农产品的进口，从而使得这些国家不得不从内部市场以高于世界市场的价格进口农产品。这种分工虽然对共同体内部农业较发达的法国、意大利、荷兰等国有利，但它保护了落后，降低了世界农业生产效率，因此，从世界经济的角度来看，却不能说这是一种合理的国际分工。
        对发展中国家利用外资的不利影响
    发达资本主义国家的经济集团化对发展中国家利用外资有什么不利影响呢？我认为，主要的影响在于它使发达资本主义国家的相互投资增加，而流入发展中国家的资本数量（特别是直接投资数量）相对减少，从而严重影响到发展中国家利用外资的来源。这是因为，发达资本主义国家经济集团采取内外有别的贸易政策，从而使一部分作为非成员国的发达资本主义国家对该经济集团的出口贸易受到严重阻碍（例如前面所述的美国、日本对欧洲经济共同体出口比重的下降），在这种情况下，这些国家就往往通过扩大资本输出，特别是直接资本输出的办法，就地建厂，就地生产，就地销售，以绕过经济集团的关税和非关税壁垒，分享产品免税流通的好处。以美国对欧洲共同体的投资为例。由于共同体成立后，美国对共同体国家的出口贸易受到严重影响，市场占有率也迅速下降。为了扭转颓势，美国政府便大力支持美国企业家在共同体内部投资建厂，就地销售。目前，共同体国家内部的美资企业在当地的销售额已远远超过了美国对共同体国家的商品出口额。特别是最近几年，由于欧洲共同体提出要在1992年建立欧洲统一大市场，因此，更进一步激起了美国公司对欧洲的投资热潮，1987年美国公司在欧洲用来收买公司和建设工厂的投资已达209亿美元，为1982年的28倍。与此同时，日本对欧洲共同体的直接投资也呈现出同样的趋势。1988年，日本在共同体的企业已达400家，比1987年增加了100家。以上事实说明，发达资本主义国家经济集团的成立，促进了它们相互投资的发展，不利于发展中国家的外资引进。
            对国际经济协调的不利影响
    随着世界经济集团化的发展，今后的国际经济协调将由国家与国家之间的协调逐步转变为集团与集团之间的协调。这种协调主体的改变，一方面给国际经济协调带来了有利因素，即协调一旦获得成功，它的覆盖面将极为广泛；但另一方面它也给国际经济协调带来了更多的困难，它使协调工作变得极为复杂和艰巨。这是因为：其一，集团内部各成员国之间由于经济发展水平不同，经济结构不同等原因而形成了各国不同的经济利益结构。因此，当国际协调不能与各国的经济利益结构相适应时，便不可避免地出现赞成国和反对国，从而使国际协调遇到很大的阻力。其二，经济集团的成立一方面加强了集团总体的经济实力，扩大了市场；另一方面又增强了集团内部成员国之间经济上的互补性，减少了它们对外部经济的依赖。因此，在国际经济协调活动中它们便有足够的法码来抵抗外部压力。
