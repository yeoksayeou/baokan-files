There aren't many people who support spanking children, but among parents, there are very few who don't spank their children. Not every parent adheres to educational principles, but most will say that spanking is not the solution. However, when the moment comes, who cares about what is the solution and what isn't? Without a second thought, they spank and then think about it later. After all, parents spanking their children isn't against the law. One parent, while spanking their child, said, "I feed you, so I have the right to spank you!" Look at that logic, so simple! "Spare the rod, spoil the child," and "A child beaten is a child taught" are still the beliefs of some parents. So, children can't escape physical pain. We all grew up as children, and how many of us haven't been spanked by our parents?

If we say that not physically punishing or indirectly punishing children (of course, this means not spanking) is an educational principle, it's not entirely accurate to say that this has always been the case. The German educator Herbart advocated for using methods such as "depriving freedom," "banning meals," "locking in a confinement room," and "standing in the corner" to deal with children's "savage mischief," making their unruly wills submit. It seems unbelievable today for an educator to advocate for spanking children, but as an educator from the early 19th century, this view was once popular in German and Russian classical middle schools, French national middle schools, and other schools in various countries. Even today, who can say that this view has no market? Teachers in schools can't spank students, so they use equally intimidating forms of punishment. When physical punishment is not allowed, they use indirect punishment—there are many new tricks. The author once conducted a special survey and concluded that physical punishment and indirect physical punishment are still prevalent in primary and secondary schools, and some creative methods are even beyond what Herbart could have imagined. As for parents, it's straightforward: three words don't align, and they spank!

However, spanking children today is not so easy! Once, I visited an old classmate's home, and his child was having a lot of fun, rolling around and acting silly. The child understood adult psychology, knowing that with a guest present, his parents would have to let him have his way. But eventually, he pushed it too far and knocked over the teapot.

"All because you spoil him! He's almost crazy, can't you give him a few slaps? You're such a coward!" My classmate, while defending himself with "How is it because I spoil him," grabbed the child and pressed him down on the bed, slapping his buttocks with a big hand. And to prove he wasn't a "coward," he used extra force. The child thought it was just a scare and laughed, shouting, "It doesn't hurt! It doesn't hurt at all!" This was like pouring oil on the fire. When he realized it was for real, he knew the "real deal," and started wailing loudly.

The wife's stance suddenly changed. She angrily snatched the child from her husband's hands, stroking the child's red buttocks, and shouted at her unfortunate husband, "You bastard, he's not your own child? How dare you hit him so hard!" She then charged at her husband, and they started fighting; at this point, the husband had lost all his husbandly dignity, only defending himself and retreating step by step... The child stopped crying and became a spectator.

When I was young, I often got spanked by my mom. Her usual weapon was a "broom handle," and sometimes she used a "rolling pin." The broom handle was all show and no substance; but the rolling pin was different, it could leave bruises, and it would hurt for days.

That was a night after a severe spanking. In my dream, it still felt hot and painful, but I felt raindrops falling on my skin, slightly cooling and refreshing. Suddenly, I woke up and saw Mom sitting by my bed, looking at the bruises, crying alone, her tears dropping onto my body... I turned over, not wanting Mom to know I was awake, but my hatred for Mom had completely disappeared. I suddenly remembered a sentence: "The pain is on the child, but the mother's heart aches."

From this, it can be seen that spanking children is not easy; and "spanking" also contains complex emotions. If we only use a binary logic of "right" and "wrong" to judge it, it seems a bit too simple. This might be the reason why spanking children is repeatedly banned but still persists. Of course, it's better to spank less, and not to spank at all is best. There are some parents who are very good at educating their children and never spank, and they can be role models. There are some teachers who never get angry with their students, let alone spank. Except for the very special "episode" in Makarenko's "Educational Poem," teachers cannot spank students. Parents, if they spank, should also have a "measure," that is, "moderation." Spanking children is also an art; not spanking, that is the ultimate art. I wonder what the education experts think?

### 打孩子也是一种艺术？

　　打孩子也是一种艺术？
　　王晋堂
    说起打孩子，赞成的不会很多；但做父母的，不打孩子的又委实很少。不一定每位家长都讲教育原则，但多数会说打不是办法；可一旦火头上来，哪还顾得什么是办法什么不是办法？不管三七二十一，打了再说。横竖老子打儿子也不算犯法。有位家长边打孩子边说：“我养活你就许打你！”您看，这道理多朴素！“不打不成材”，“棍棒底下出孝子”还是一些家长的信条。如此，孩子就难逃皮肉之苦了。我们都从孩子过来，没尝过爹妈打的，又有多少？
    倘说对孩子不许体罚和变相体罚（当然就不许打了）是一条教育原则，古已有之，也不尽然。德国教育家赫尔巴特就倡导采用“剥夺自由”、“禁止用餐”、“关禁闭室”、
  “站壁角”等方法，以对待儿童“野蛮的顽皮性”，使其放荡不羁的意志就范。一位教育家主张体罚孩子，在今天看来似乎不可思议。但做为19世纪上叶这位教育家的观点，在德国和俄国的古典中学、法国的国立中学和其他各国中学里盛行一时；时至今日，谁能说就没有市场了呢？学校的老师不便打学生，就取有同等威慑力量的体罚；体罚不被允许，就变相体罚——那翻新的花样多得很。笔者曾专门做过调查，结论是中小学内体罚和变相体罚还普遍存在，且有些创造性的方法连赫尔巴特也会自愧弗如。至于家长，那就直截了当，三句话不投机：打！
    然而当今打孩子，也颇非易举哩！一次，我到一位老同学家串门，他的孩子可来了劲儿，翻来滚去、撒泼嘻闹。孩子很懂大人心理，他知道有客人在，爹妈就得让他一筹。但终于乐极生悲，碰翻了茶壶。
      “都是你惯的！都快疯了，你就不能打他几巴掌？你这窝囊废！”我那同学一边分辩“怎么是我惯的”，一边把孩子抓过来按在床上，大巴掌照着屁股就下去了。而且为证明不是“窝囊废”，还格外用了气力，孩子以为不过是吓唬他，笑着嚷“不疼不疼！一点都不疼！”这无异于火上浇油，等知道“动了真格的”，知道了“马王爷几只眼”，便噢噢大哭起来。
    女主人立场骤然有变。她愤怒地从丈夫手中抢过孩子，抚着孩子通红的屁股蛋，冲那倒霉的丈夫吼起来：“你这挨千刀的，他不是你亲生的？敢下这么毒的手！”说着向丈夫冲过去，撕扭起来；此时的丈夫，已全然没了丈夫气概，只有招架推挡，且战且退……孩子不哭了，成了观战者。
    小时候我也常挨妈妈打。她的常规武器是“条帚疙瘩”，偶尔也有用“擀面杖”的时候，条帚疙瘩是银样蜡枪头，雷声大雨点稀；可擀面杖就不同了，能打得青一块紫一块，要疼好几天。
    那是遭了重打的一个夜晚，梦中似乎还火辣辣地疼，但觉有雨滴落在皮肤上，稍有一丝凉凉的爽意。猛然惊醒，见妈妈在床边坐着端详那青紫处，正独自落泪，泪水啪嗒啪嗒落在我身上……我转过身，不想让母亲知道我醒过，但对妈妈的恨已然全消。我突然想起看过一句话：“打在儿子身上，疼在妈妈心上”。
    仅此可见，打孩子颇非易举；而且“打”中也含有复杂的感情。倘只以“对”、“不对”的二值逻辑来评断它，似乎简单了一点。这或许是打孩子屡禁不绝而绵延于世的缘故吧？当然，还是少打为好，不打为佳。很有些家长教子有方，从来不打的，可为楷模。很有些教师从来没有跟学生发过脾气，更不消说打。除马卡连柯《教育诗》中极特殊的“插曲”外，教师不能打学生。父母之于孩子，倘若打，也要有个“度”，即“分寸”。打孩子也是一种艺术；不打呢，那才是艺术的极致。不知教育专家们以为然否？
