More and more American teenagers are becoming addicted to gambling. Like drinking and drug abuse, gambling is driving hundreds of thousands of teenagers who should be in school onto the path of crime.

According to a report from the American Gambling Disorder Research Center, in the 1960s, gambling was only popular among middle-aged white businessmen. Now it has spread to teenagers of different races. Teenage gambling is set to become a major social issue in the next decade.

The report says that the stakes in teenage gambling are often shockingly high, leading to situations where losers are driven to suicide or murder. In Dallas, 10 students from Carter Middle School, after losing money in a dice game, banded together with guns to commit armed robbery. They were eventually caught by the police and sent to prison. The sociology department of St. John's University conducted a survey in many middle schools in New Jersey, finding that 91% of the students surveyed admitted to having participated in some form of gambling. More than half had tried roulette in nightclubs, and even more had bought instant lottery tickets.

Sociologists and legal experts believe that various lottery activities opened by many states to increase local revenue have fueled the speculative mindset of both teenagers and adults, leading them to gradually develop gambling addictions.

The research report suggests that the societal trend of using money as the standard for everything has caused the idea of "getting rich quick" to grow maliciously in people's minds. Thus, the allure of money in casinos naturally attracts a large number of teenagers. Many enlightened individuals in the United States have already seen the seriousness of the situation and are calling for the nation to pay more attention to the spiritual education of its youth.

    美国青少年嗜赌导致犯罪
    陈封
    越来越多的美国青少年已陷于赌博而不能自拔。与饮酒、吸毒一样，赌博驱使成千上万应入学的青少年走上犯罪道路。
    据美国赌博病症研究中心的一份报告说，60年代，赌博仅流行于中年白人的商人阶层，如今已蔓延到不同肤色的十几岁孩子群中。美国青少年沉溺于赌博的现象势将成为今后10年的一大社会问题。
    报告说，青少年聚赌时的赌注往往大得惊人，以致赌债往往逼得输家自杀或杀人。达拉斯市卡特中学的10个学生因掷骰子输了钱，结伙持枪抢劫，结果被警察抓获而锒铛入狱。圣约翰大学社会学系对新泽西州许多中学作了一番调查，被访问的中学生有91％承认曾参加过某种形式的赌博，半数以上去试过夜总会的轮盘赌，更多的则买过当场中奖的彩票。
    社会学家和司法界人士认为，很多州为了增加地方收入而开办的各式各样的彩票活动都助长了青少年以及成年人的投机心理，由碰碰运气而逐渐染上赌瘾。
    研究报告认为，以金钱作为衡量一切事物标准的社会风气使“快发财”思想在人们头脑中恶性膨胀。于是赌场上金钱的闪光自然会引诱大批青少年入彀。美国不少有识之士已看到事态的严重性，他们呼吁全国重视青少年的精神教育。（附图片）
