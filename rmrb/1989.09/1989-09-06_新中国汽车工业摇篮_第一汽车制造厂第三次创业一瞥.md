In the golden autumn of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic, the First Automobile Works has burst out of the starting line for its third venture.

This starting line reaches towards a brilliant future, and it is also tightly connected to the more than 30 years of tumultuous history… On July 15, 1953, just after the smoke of war had dissipated, the sound of drums and shovels at the groundbreaking ceremony of the First Automobile Works echoed through the sky. Three years later, China's first automobile city miraculously rose from the overgrown wilderness in the southwestern outskirts of Changchun. From then on, the "Off-Road" and "Red Flag" models were successively launched, and the pride of the motherland—the "Liberation" trucks—drove towards all corners of the country. From 1983 to 1986, the Second Venture of the First Automobile Works achieved victory, and the imposing CA141 five-tonne truck took over the baton from the "Old Liberation." Now, 33 years have passed in a flash. The First Automobile Works, built shortly after the founding of the Republic, has written a glorious chapter: it has cumulatively produced 1.46 million vehicles of various types, accounting for half of the national vehicle inventory; it has realized taxes and profits of 7.4 billion yuan, more than ten times the initial investment; and it has sent out 18,000 talents of various kinds to the country.

Yesterday's glory has become history, and the vision of the pioneers is always directed towards the future. Last year, the news of the approval of the Third Venture plan came, and the automobile city boiled with excitement.

The "Third Venture" has expressed the grand aspiration of the First Automobile Works, becoming a powerful magnet that unites 80,000 employees. The silver-haired pioneers of the factory's founding said with deep emotion: "Before we retire, we want to contribute our last efforts to the takeoff of the First Automobile Works!" Young people in their twenties and thirties excitedly said: "We have caught up with this good time for the venture, and we vow to dedicate our youth to the takeoff of the First Automobile Works!" This year, the Third Venture has entered a critical moment, and basic construction, process preparation, equipment manufacturing, and assembly line installation are being carried out vigorously throughout the factory.

In the scorching summer of Changchun, the Third Venture of the automobile city is also in full swing. From the eastern factory area to the western factory area, workshops are rising, and the sound of machinery is roaring. Several generations of the First Automobile Works are painting the blueprint of the Third Venture on the land of the First Automobile Works.

    新中国汽车工业摇篮
    ——第一汽车制造厂第三次创业一瞥
    在国庆40周年的金秋时节，第一汽车制造厂冲出了第三次创业的起跑点。
    这起跑点伸向灿烂的未来，更紧紧连着那30多年的峥嵘岁月……1953年7月15日，在战争硝烟刚刚散尽后，一汽破土动工的锣鼓声、锹镐声惊天而起。3年后，我国第一座汽车城神话般地崛起在杂草丛生的长春西南荒郊。自此，“越野”、“红旗”相继问世，祖国的骄子——成阵的“解放牌”，驶向祖国四方。1983至1986年，一汽的第二次创业赢得胜利，气派的CA141五吨大卡车，接过了“老解放”的接力棒。如今，33个年头匆匆而过，共和国诞生不久建成的第一汽车制造厂，已写下她的光辉篇章：累计生产各类汽车146万辆，相当全国保有车数的1／2；实现利税74亿元，相当建厂投资的10倍多；向全国输送各种人才18000名。
    昨日的荣誉成为历史，创业者的目光永远向着未来。去年，第三次创业规划被批准的消息传来，汽车城沸腾了。
      “第三次创业”喊出了一汽人的宏志宿愿，成为凝聚8万职工的强大磁石。鬓发如银的建厂元老深情地说：“趁退休前，我们要为一汽腾飞再尽一把力！”二三十岁的年轻人激动地讲：“我们赶上这次创业的好时候，誓为一汽腾飞献青春！”今年，第三次创业进入关键时刻，基本建设、工艺准备、工装设备制造、流水线安装在全厂如火如荼展开。
    盛夏的长春，热浪炙人。汽车城第三次创业也正红火。从东厂区到西厂区，厂房耸起，机声隆隆，几代一汽人，正在一汽的土地上描绘着汽车厂第三次创业的蓝图。
