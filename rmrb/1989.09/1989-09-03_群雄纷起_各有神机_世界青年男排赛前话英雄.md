More than 250 male volleyball players from 16 countries and regions have arrived in Athens to participate in the fifth World Youth Men's Volleyball Championship, which will be held from September 3 to 12.

The Soviet Union team is the most eye-catching. With an average height of 1.97 meters, they are the tallest team in the competition. In the past four editions of the World Youth Men's Volleyball Championship, they have won the gold medal three times, only losing in the previous edition and securing third place, with the gold medal being taken by the South Korean team. This time in Athens, the Soviet Union team has vowed to avenge their defeat.

The South Korean team, of course, has been well-prepared. Although their average height is only 1.91 meters, which is less than the Soviet Union team, they will not easily give up the championship. They were the first to arrive in Athens. Apart from undergoing rigorous training, they also played two matches against the Greek youth men's volleyball team, losing one 0:3 and winning the other 3:1. Observers can see that the South Korean team is "keeping their true strength hidden," saving their best for the competition.

The Cuban team, which finished as runners-up in the previous edition, is also a formidable opponent. Their average height is 1.94 meters. Their goal is to "defend their top three position" and strive for the gold medal.

The Italian team has only participated in one edition of the competition, in 1985, where they finished as runners-up. Their average height is 1.94 meters. Locals describe the Italian team as "mysterious, with many questions," but they are "not here to sightsee, they will definitely compete for a high ranking."

The South American powerhouse, Brazil, has consistently been in the top six in the previous four editions, finishing third in 1977, runners-up in 1981, and sixth in both 1985 and 1987. This time, their goal is to "enter the top three" and strive for the gold medal.

In the group stage, the Chinese team will face Bulgaria, Greece, and Spain. Local newspapers view the "China-Bulgaria rivalry" as the highlight of Group A. The Bulgarian team is a strong force in European volleyball, having participated in only two World Youth Championships, both times finishing fifth. This year, they have sent their "strongest lineup," with an average height of 1.94 meters. According to reports, their goal is to win the gold medal.

The Chinese team, although they finished as runners-up in 1977, have since seen their rankings drop to fourth, seventh, and ninth place. Local commentators believe that the "Chinese team is a current powerhouse in the world of volleyball, and how they will line up this time is still unknown." The Chinese team's average height is 1.92 meters. They traveled from Italy to Athens without any jet lag, and upon landing, they immediately began training, showing that they have been well-prepared.

In Group A, the host team Greece has been planning for a long time. Their goal is to "eliminate one of the two strong teams (China and Bulgaria) in Group A" and strive to enter the top six, with the ideal outcome being to win a medal. To this end, they have played 30 matches against the Greek national team, with an equal number of wins and losses. Especially after winning a warm-up match against South Korea 3:0, their morale has been boosted. Additionally, playing on home turf gives them the advantages of favorable weather, terrain, and public support, and the Greeks have a tradition of winning at home, making their strength not to be underestimated.

### 群雄纷起　各有神机——世界青年男排赛前话英雄

    群雄纷起　各有神机
    ——世界青年男排赛前话英雄
    新华社雅典9月1日电（记者李成贵）来自16个国家和地区的250多名男排健儿已抵达雅典，将参加9月3日至12日举行的第五届世界青年男子排球锦标赛。
    苏联队最为引人注目。全队队员平均身高1米97，是所有队中最高的，在过去4届世青男排赛中，3次获得金牌，只是在上届比赛中失利，仅得了个第三名，金牌被南朝鲜队夺走。此次来雅典，苏联队发誓要报这“一箭之仇”。
    南朝鲜队当然早有防备，其队员平均身高虽只有1米91，不及苏联队，但他们绝不会轻易把冠军宝座让出。他们是最先抵达雅典的。除了进行艰苦训练外，还与希腊青年男排进行了两场比赛。一场以0∶3败北，一场以3∶1取胜。明眼人一看便知，南朝鲜队是“真人不露相”，留了一手。
    上届亚军古巴队也并非善主，此次来雅典的队员平均身高1米94。他们目标是“力保前三名”，争取得金牌。
    意大利队在以往的4届比赛中，只参加过1985年的一届，获得亚军，其队员平均身高1米94。此间人士称意大利队为“陌生，很多疑问”，但“他们不是来旅游的，肯定要争高低”。
    南美劲旅巴西队在前4届比赛中均在前六名之列，1977年列第三名，1981年获亚军，1985年和1987年均为第六名。此次他们的目标是“打进前三名”，力争拿金牌。
    中国队在分组赛中的对手是保加利亚、希腊和西班牙队。这里的报纸把“中保之争”看作是A组的重头戏。保队是欧洲排坛强队，过去只参加过两次世青赛，均获第五名。今年派出的是“最强阵容”，队员平均身高1米94，据报道其目标是夺金牌。
    中国队虽然在1977年获得过亚军，但后来名次逐届降至第四、七、九名。这里的评论家认为，“中国队是当今世界排坛劲旅，此次如何布阵，还是个未知数。”中国队队员平均身高1米92。他们从意大利来到这里，无时差干扰，下了飞机就去训练，可见早有神机。
    A组中希腊队是东道主，预谋已久。他们定下的目标是“在A组中拚掉两强（中、保）之一”，力争进入前六名，最理想的结果是拿一块奖牌。为此，他们与希腊国家队进行了30场比赛，输赢各半。尤其是在热身赛中以3∶0胜了南朝鲜队后，他们的士气大振，加上在本土比赛，占尽天时地利人和等有利条件，且希腊人有在门口打胜仗的传统，其实力不可低估。
