The nationwide conference to commend labor models and advanced workers held an experience exchange meeting this morning in the Great Hall of the People. Seven comrades shared their experiences of selfless dedication and hard work for socialist modernization, which were warmly received by the audience.

The first to take the stage was Liu Haishan, a worker from the Shanghai Construction Machinery Factory. His speech was titled "The Spirit of 'Ants Gnawing on Bones' Inspires Me to Strive Forward." Liu Haishan, originally a tricycle worker with only a primary school education, has taught himself to the level of a college graduate. He said that an ant can carry something 30 times its weight, and a person's value should be measured by their contribution to the people and society. He vowed to share his knowledge freely and apply it to production, striving to be an innovator in technology. Liu Haishan has completed an average of 6 innovation projects per year.

Next to speak was Zhang Zhenliang, the party branch secretary of Douzhuang Village, Fangshan District, Beijing. Since 1956, he has led the villagers in scientific farming, always prioritizing agricultural production, especially grain production. The once "poor, dilapidated, and impoverished" Douzhuang has undergone a fundamental transformation, with all villagers collectively becoming wealthy. It is praised as the "embryo of a modern socialist new countryside."

Huang Weilu, a rocket expert from the Second Research Institute of the Aerospace Industry, shared his and his comrades' moving stories of creating "pride rockets" for the country and the Chinese nation.

More than 2,700 national labor models and advanced workers listened attentively to the speeches. The Great Hall of the People was silent. Other speakers at the conference included Jiang Lan, a nurse from Chengdu Fourth People's Hospital who devoted her youth to mental patients; Wang Zhijun, the director and chief engineer of Changzhou Diesel Engine Factory, who created a famous brand through self-reliance; Zhang Zhen, a "guardian of the republic" and driver from a certain unit who chose to die rather than give up the steering wheel during the suppression of a counter-revolutionary riot; and Yu Changrong, a teacher from Panzhuang Primary School in Panlong Township, Chenggu County, Shaanxi, who is dedicated to nurturing young talents in the Qinling Mountains. Their speeches were met with enthusiastic applause.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun and State Councilor Li Tieming attended the meeting. Minister of Agriculture He Kang presided over the meeting.

The experience exchange meeting will continue tomorrow.

    劳模大会举行经验交流会
    七位同志登台介绍先进事迹
    本报北京9月29日讯  记者黄彩忠报道：全国劳动模范和先进工作者表彰大会今天上午在人民大会堂举行经验交流会议，7位同志介绍了他们为社会主义现代化建设忘我劳动、无私奉献的体会，受到了大家的热烈欢迎。
    第一个走上讲台的是上海建设机器厂工人刘海珊。他发言的题目是《“蚂蚁啃骨头”精神激励我顽强登攀》。刘海珊原是个三轮车工人，半文盲，年轻时连上海的路牌都认不全，通过自学已达到大专文化水平。刘海珊说，一个蚂蚁能搬大于体重30倍的东西，人生的价值应该看他对人民、对社会的奉献。我要把学到的知识无偿地奉献出来，用到生产上去，争当技术上的革新者。刘海珊平均每年搞成6个革新项目。
    接着发言的是北京市房山区窦店村党总支书记仉振亮。他从1956年当支部书记至今，带领乡亲坚持科学种田，始终把农业生产特别是粮食生产放在突出的地位。昔日“破、烂、穷”的窦店发生了根本变化，全村农民集体致富，被誉为“社会主义现代化新农村的雏型”。
    我国的火箭专家、航空航天部第二研究院技术总顾问黄纬禄在发言中介绍了他和同志们一起，为祖国争光，为中华民族争气，造出“争气火箭”的感人事迹。
    2700多名全国劳动模范和先进工作者认真听着发言，人民大会堂内一片寂静。今天在大会上介绍经验的还有乐为精神病人献青春的成都第四人民医院护士江兰；自力更生创名牌的常州柴油机厂厂长兼总工程师汪志钧；宁愿全身血流干、在平息反革命暴乱中死也不丢方向盘的“共和国卫士”、某部汽车驾驶员张震；志在秦岭育幼苗的陕西城固县盘龙乡付家坪小学教师禹长荣。他们的发言都赢得了热烈掌声。
    国务院副总理田纪云、国务委员李铁映出席了今天的会议。农业部长何康主持会议。
    经验交流会明天将继续举行。
