Currently, one of the main reasons for the disorder in circulation is the lack of strong macro-control measures by the state over the market. In the past few years, while emphasizing the delegation of administrative powers, the establishment of a new economic constraint mechanism was often neglected. At the same time, due to the influence of regional and departmental interests, multiple entities engage in commerce, policies are issued from multiple sources, and each entity manages its own affairs, forming independent systems. This has led to serious issues such as chaotic circulation channels, bloated intermediate links, weakened contract constraints, rampant speculation and illegal activities, and significant losses of state assets. Some behaviors have even seriously deviated from the socialist management direction, disrupting the smooth progress of reform and opening up, and urgently require effective management and supervision.

It should be noted that the strengthening of circulation management must be based on openness and vitality. By adjusting and streamlining various circulation policies and strengthening unified management, we can effectively prevent the return of the old system and better rectify and deepen the reform. In this process, it is necessary to use certain administrative measures to ensure the implementation of the state's commercial policies and regulations; use legal measures to effectively supervise the business activities of various commercial entities, protect the legitimate interests of all parties involved in transactions, stop various infringing behaviors, and maintain the normal and legal operation order of enterprises; use economic measures to adjust the commercial structure, increase effective supply, fundamentally improve the market environment, and create and establish a good circulation order that allows for equal competition.

Currently, strengthening circulation management requires solving the following issues:

1. Establishing a unified management institution and a networked management system.

The current multi-faceted commercial management system should be phased out as soon as possible, and a specialized institution should be established to manage the various commercial entities in society. All enterprises, units, and individuals engaged in commercial activities, regardless of their affiliation, economic composition, business methods, or scale, should be brought under the management and supervision of this specialized institution.

The functions of the institution that manages various commercial entities should be determined according to the requirements of deepening reform. In my opinion, its main functions should be to unify the planning of the market structure and network layout in the region, and to directly manage and supervise the economic activities of micro-economic units and the commodity trading behaviors between units.

Currently, to meet the needs of rectification and reform, the functions of the institution that manages various commercial entities should primarily rely on administrative measures. As the market environment improves, its functions will gradually shift towards relying mainly on economic and legal measures.

While establishing the specialized management institution, it is also necessary to establish and improve a networked management system that adapts to the development needs of various commercial entities, and implement industry-based management. By dividing management responsibilities by industry, each industry's supervisory department can establish industry management associations, transitioning from managing state-owned enterprises in the industry to managing the business activities of the entire industry, supervising the implementation of commercial policies in the industry, protecting the business interests of the industry, and handling relevant tasks assigned or entrusted by the institution that manages various commercial entities.

2. Accelerating economic legislation.

The management of various commercial entities must be conducted in accordance with the law. Only a complete system of economic legislation and judicial institutions can establish a stable market operating order, promote equal competition, and ensure that commodity circulation remains in an orderly state for a long time. Currently, China's legal system is not yet complete, which adds some difficulty to the unified management of various commercial entities. Therefore, economic legislation should be accelerated, and laws such as the "Market Law," "Commercial Law," "Company Law," and "Anti-Monopoly Law" should be studied and formulated as soon as possible to provide a legal basis for the unified management of various commercial entities.

3. Adhering to the principle of combining relaxation with control, and rectifying the price order.

Currently, issues such as layer-upon-layer price increases and reselling in the circulation field indicate the necessity of strengthening price management. The current widely adopted incremental pricing method by enterprises has both advantages and disadvantages. It often causes the prices of scarce commodities to rise with the increase in the number of circulation links. In light of this, various places have regulations such as commodities in the same city not exceeding one wholesale link, and commodities circulating within a province generally not exceeding two links, etc. However, the implementation is difficult because it is impossible to verify whether each batch and item of the commodities purchased by enterprises has exceeded the regulated wholesale links. In my opinion, a feasible improvement method is for the price department to periodically publish the specific prices of each link for major scarce commodities, which can effectively prevent multiple commodity transfers and layer-upon-layer price increases. At the same time, for general commodities, especially those with a balanced supply and demand, the incremental pricing method can continue to be implemented. For retail enterprises' commodities, a maximum price can be implemented to prevent commodity prices from "snowballing."

    略谈强化流通管理问题
    沙洪君
    当前流通秩序混乱的一个重要原因，是国家对市场的管理缺乏强有力的宏观调控手段。前几年强调下放行政权力，往往忽视尽快建立健全新的经济制约机制。与此同时，由于受条块分割和部门利益的影响，多头经商，政出多门，谁办谁管，自成体系，导致流通渠道混乱、中间环节膨胀、合同约束软化、投机违法丛生、国家财产大量流失等相当严重的无规则无秩序现象，有的行为甚至严重偏离了社会主义经营方向，干扰了改革和开放的顺利进行，迫切需要实施有效的管理和监督。
    应该指出，这里讲的强化流通管理必须以开放搞活为前提。通过调整和理顺各项流通政策，加强统一的管理，既能有效地防止旧体制复归，又能较好地治理整顿和深化改革。在这个过程中，有必要借助一定的行政手段，保证国家各项商业政策和法规的贯彻落实；借助法律手段有效地监督多种商业成份的经营活动，保护交易各方的合法利益，制止种种侵权行为，维护正常合法的企业运行秩序；借助经济手段，调整商业结构，增加有效供给，从根本上改善市场环境，创造和建立能够展开平等竞争的良好的流通秩序。
      目前强化流通管理，需要解决以下几个问题。
      一、建立统一管理的专门机构和网络化管理体系。
    现存的多元化商业管理体制应该尽快结束，成立专门机构对社会上的多种商业成份进行统一管理。所有从事商业经营活动的企业、单位和个人，不分隶属关系，不分经济成份，不分经营方式，不分经营规模，都纳入这一专门机构的管理和监督之下。
    统管多种商业成份的机构的职能，要按照深化改革的要求而确定。我认为，它的主要职能应该是对本地区的市场结构和网点布局进行统一规划，对微观经济单位的经济活动和单位之间的商品交易行为进行直接管理和监督。
    当前，为适应治理整顿的需要，统管多种商业成份的机构的职能应以行政手段为主。随着市场环境的改善，它的职能将逐步转向以经济的法律的手段为主。
    在建立统管的专门机构的同时，还要建立健全与之相适应的适合多种商业成份发展需要的网络化管理体系，实行分行业管理。按行业管理分工，各行业主管部门可以成立行业管理协会，由主管本行业国营企业过渡到对全行业的经营活动进行管理，监督本行业商业政策的执行，维护本行业的经营利益，办理统管多种商业成份的机构交办和委托的有关工作。
    二、加快经济立法。
    统管多种商业成份必须依法办事。只有完备的经济立法和司法制度，才能确立起稳固的市场运行规则，开展平等竞争，商品流通才能长期处于有序状态。目前我国法律体系还不完备，这就给统一管理多种商业成份的操作增加了一定的难度。因此，要加快经济立法，尽快研究制定《市场法》、《商业法》、《公司法》、《反垄断法》等，以便统一管理多种商业成份的工作有法可依。
    三、坚持放管结合的原则，整顿价格秩序。
    当前流通领域中出现层层加价、转手倒卖等混乱现象，这表明加强价格管理非常必要。目前企业普遍采用的顺加作价法利弊并存，它往往使紧俏的商品价格随商品经过环节的增多而“水涨船高”。鉴此，目前各地规定商品在同一城市不得超过一道批发环节，在省内流通一般不超过两道环节，等等。但实施起来难度太大，因为对企业购进的众多的商品是否超过了规定的批发环节，不可能每一批每一件都去查清。我认为可行的改进办法是，对主要紧俏商品由物价部门定期公布每道环节的具体价格，这样可以有效地防止商品多次转手，层层加价。同时，对于一般商品，尤其是供求平衡的商品，可以继续实行顺加作价的办法。对零售企业的商品可以实行最高限价，以防止商品价格“滚雪球”。
