	Gorbachev on the CPSU's Nationality Policy: Comprehensive Discussion of National Relations and Formulation of a Modern Strategy Prohibiting Any Manifestations of National Hostility

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 19th - Today, at the Central Committee Plenum, CPSU General Secretary Gorbachev pointed out that in the current complex situation of national relations in the Soviet Union, the task facing the CPSU is to comprehensively discuss the current state of domestic national relations from a principled standpoint and formulate the party's modern strategy on national issues. Any manifestations of nationalism and chauvinism, as well as any attempts to incite hostility towards any nationality, are unacceptable.

	At today's opening of the Central Committee Plenum, Gorbachev delivered a report titled "The Party's Nationality Policy Under Current Conditions." In his report, he stated that it is no longer tolerable for many criminal acts to go unpunished on the soil of nationalism. It is time to prohibit through legal procedures the activities of nationalist, chauvinist, and other extremist organizations and to dissolve these organizations.

	When discussing the implementation of Lenin's principle of national self-determination under current conditions, he criticized the attempts to reduce the self-determination of the peoples of the Soviet Union to actions of secession from the Soviet Union. He pointed out that "national self-determination is a complex, multi-faceted process of establishing national dignity, developing language and culture, strengthening political autonomy, and achieving economic and social progress."

	Gorbachev firmly rejected the idea of redrawing national territorial boundaries, pointing out that such actions would only make the already complex situation even more complicated. Gorbachev emphasized that in places where the situation is escalating and people's lives and safety are threatened, the full force of Soviet law will be used to take decisive action. He pointed out that the dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast has developed to the point where it may have unpredictable consequences. He warned that decisive measures must be taken to stop the anarchy.

	Gorbachev expounded on the expansion of the economic autonomy of the republics and the implementation of regional economic accounting, while also pointing out the dangers of economic isolation policies. He said that only adventurers would advocate for "independence," "secession," and the division of a society bound together by economic, political, social, and spiritual ties. It is not permissible for there to be not one central authority, but 15 or even hundreds of central authorities to solve emerging problems after decentralization. Economically, both meaningful decentralization and the realization of a national construction plan are needed.

	It is well known that the language issue is a major problem facing the Soviet Union today. Residents of the three Baltic republics and the Moldavian Republic, among others, have held mass meetings, demonstrations, and even strikes due to their dissatisfaction with the language laws. While affirming the right of the titular nationalities of each republic to designate their own language as the state language, Gorbachev suggested that Russian be designated as the state language of the Soviet Union.

    戈尔巴乔夫谈苏共民族政策
    按照原则立场全面讨论民族关系制定苏共对民族问题的现代战略不允许任何挑起民族敌视的表现
    据新华社莫斯科9月19日电　苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫今天在中央全会上指出，在当前苏联民族关系极为复杂的形势下，苏共面临的任务是：从原则立场出发全面地讨论国内民族关系的现状和制定党对民族问题的现代战略；任何民族主义和沙文主义的表现，以及挑起对任何一个民族的敌视都是不能允许的。
    在今天开幕的中央全会上，戈尔巴乔夫作了题为《当前条件下党的民族政策》的报告。他在报告中说，再也不能容忍在民族主义土壤上产生的许多犯罪行为不受惩罚，已经到了应该通过法律程序来禁止民族主义的、沙文主义的和其他极端主义的组织的活动并解散这些组织的时候了。
    他在谈到在当前条件下实现列宁民族自决的原则时，批判了把苏联各族人民自决只归结为脱离苏联的行动的企图。指出“民族自决是确立民族尊严、发展语言和文化、巩固政治自主和经济社会进步的复杂的、多方面的过程。”
    戈尔巴乔夫断然否定了重新划分民族领土疆界的意见，指出这样做只会使本已不简单的形势更为复杂起来。戈尔巴乔夫强调，在形势激化、人的生命和安全受到威胁的地方，将使用苏联法律的全部威力来采取坚决的行动。他指出，亚美尼亚和阿塞拜疆围绕纳戈尔诺—卡拉巴赫自治州归属问题的争端，已发展到可能产生难以预料的后果的地步。他警告要采取“坚决措施”来制止无政府状态。
    戈尔巴乔夫阐述了扩大共和国经济自主权和实行地区经济核算，同时指出经济孤立政策的危险性。他说，只有冒险主义者才会号召“独立”、“脱离”，以及分割由经济、政治、社会、精神等纽带联系在一起的社会。不能允许在放权后不是由一个中央，而是由15个甚至几百个中央来解决产生问题。经济上既需要意义深远的非集中化，更需要实现全国性的建设纲要。
    众所周知，语言问题是当前苏联面临的一个难题。波罗的海沿岸3个共和国和摩尔达维亚共和国等地居民，由于对语言法不满而举行群众集会、游行示威，甚至罢工。戈尔巴乔夫在肯定各共和国主体居民有权确定本民族语言为国语的同时，建议将俄语定为苏联国语。
