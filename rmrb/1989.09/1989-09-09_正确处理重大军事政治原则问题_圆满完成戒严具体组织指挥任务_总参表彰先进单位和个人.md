    BEIJING, Sept. 9 (Xinhua) -- The General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army held an award ceremony this afternoon to commend units and individuals for their role in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

    During the martial law enforcement in parts of the capital, the entire staff of the General Staff Department stood firm, held high the banner, resolutely implemented the series of decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission, timely and correctly handled a series of major military and political principles, and successfully completed a large number of specific organizational and command tasks, ensuring the implementation of the decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. Relevant departments meticulously drafted action plans, organized the troops to move into position, and commanded and coordinated the troops to complete tasks such as clearing the area, removing obstacles, and standing guard, ensuring the execution of the orders and the will of the Military Commission and the General Headquarters. Relevant departments sent personnel to the martial law troops, worked hard to improve and strengthen the administrative management, guard duty training, and equipment support of the troops, making the PLA appear in the streets of the capital as a just, civilized, and powerful force. Relevant departments also organized the military districts and militia to cooperate with the martial law troops and the public security and armed police in their actions, effectively maintaining social order and work production order, striking at the arrogance of the turmoil and rebellion elements, and contributing to the stopping of the turmoil and the suppression of the rebellion.

    Deputy Chief of the General Staff Xu Xin spoke at the commendation meeting, requiring all comrades in the General Staff Department to firmly establish the belief of being united with the Party and sharing the fate of the country. To adhere to the combat effectiveness standard, to strengthen military training as a regular central task. To insist on strict training and strict requirements, and to continuously improve combat effectiveness. At the same time, to combat corruption and advocate for integrity, all levels of leading cadres, especially high-level cadres, should set an example in clean governance.
