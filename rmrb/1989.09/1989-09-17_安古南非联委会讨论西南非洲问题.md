Xinhua News Agency, Havana, September 15th.

The 5th meeting of the Angola-Cuba-South Africa Joint Commission concluded in Havana on September 15th. The meeting discussed the implementation of the peace agreement for the Southwest African region signed by the three parties in New York last December.

Regarding the situation in Namibia, all three parties agreed that the process of Namibia's independence and peace is irreversible. However, there are significant disagreements between Angola and Cuba on one side and South Africa on the other regarding the election methods in Namibia.

During the discussion on the situation in Angola, representatives from Angola and Cuba condemned South Africa and the United States for continuing to support anti-government armed groups in Angola and for obstructing the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.

Members of the Angola-Cuba-South Africa Joint Commission, observers from the United States and the Soviet Union, and a representative of the United Nations Secretary-General attended the three-day meeting.
