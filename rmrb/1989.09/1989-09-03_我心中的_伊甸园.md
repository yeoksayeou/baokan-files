From a devout Christian to a proud Communist, from a military doctor in the Nationalist Army to an officer in the People's Liberation Army, I have found the true meaning of life and my own "Eden" through a tumultuous journey.

Seventy years ago, I was born into a Christian family under the blessing of a pastor. At the age of seven, I joined the church choir. Every time I sang hymns, my childish heart would pray silently: May there be love and happiness for all, may the world become a beautiful Eden...

However, old China was far from loving and happy. At the age of ten, I once accompanied my father to visit slums, which was truly a miserable world. The emaciated bodies of the elderly and the hungry eyes of children left an indelible impression on me.

I once dreamed of taking the path of "medicine to save the country." In the early 1940s, I graduated from medical school in Japan and returned to China to become a military doctor at the North China Military Medical Hospital of the Nationalist Army. However, my patriotic enthusiasm was soon replaced by a sense of helplessness. Besides being angry at the corruption of the Nationalist government and military, I also felt the sadness of being a scholar unable to change the world. The Nationalist rule was dark, and the "slums" I visited as a child were everywhere. Where could I find an "Eden"!

On January 31, 1949, we followed General Fu Zuoyi in our rebellion, taking off the Nationalist military uniform and putting on the red star of the People's Liberation Army. Awakened, I finally found new life in the dawn of the People's Republic of China.

Since then, I have tied my fate to the People's Republic—my "Eden." In 1951, I volunteered to go to the Korean battlefield and joined the surgical team. The fire of the anti-aggression war ignited our hearts to fight for the people. I remember that at that time, we would rescue the wounded at night. The road was a vague white strip, and the ambulance would rush on the bumpy road, always at risk of falling off the cliff, but the driver had no hesitation or fear; the car shook so much that it felt like the bones would fall apart, but the seriously injured soldiers did not make a sound; the blood plasma was very scarce, and many Communists insisted on giving the blood plasma to other wounded soldiers first, sacrificing their own lives! In more than a year on the Korean battlefield, every small thing shook me. That kind of unity, closeness, selflessness, and devotion for a lofty goal was something that even a devout Christian could not compare to!

I wanted to join the Communist Party and resolutely follow the Party. This was the cry from the bottom of my heart, a new pursuit. In 1954, the Party Committee of the Beijing Military Region General Hospital appointed me as the chief of the thoracic surgery department. I worked happily. The Party, in order to take care of the intellectuals who had rebelled, gave me the rank of Grade Six in the local health system, but I declined and was willing to accept the military administrative rank, reducing my monthly salary by more than 70 yuan—I wanted to learn the spirit of Communists who were willing to suffer losses and share the country's worries. In 1958, I finally joined the Communist Party of China, realizing my lofty aspiration.

In the early days of the founding of the country, there were many tuberculosis patients in China, many of whom needed lung resection surgery. At the end of the 1950s, one day I walked past the Beijing Oxygen Plant, and suddenly a thin young man called out to me, panting. He reminded me that his name was Zhang Lixin, and a few years ago I had performed a lung resection surgery on him. At that time, he was an 18-year-old strong young man, but now he could only guard the gate. Some patients, after lung resection, although the condition was controlled, but there was a large residual cavity in the chest, the remaining lung gradually expanded, forcing the mediastinum to shift, and symptoms such as shortness of breath, lung hernia, and compensatory emphysema appeared. I took this clinical problem as a research topic to tackle. After 18 years of observation and research, I finally created the "pleural shaping surgery." This achievement won the second-class military science and technology achievement award. Many patients who underwent surgery with this method recovered well. In recent years, I have led medical staff to successfully research 11 scientific and technological achievements, written more than 50 academic papers, and produced more than 3,000 teaching slide materials, laying the foundation for further treatment and conquering thoracic difficult diseases. Hard work has given me true joy in life.

Now, I am 70 years old. For a doctor who wields a scalpel, this is an advanced age. At the end of August, I just performed a thoracic tumor resection surgery on a 7-year-old child, Guo Lei. The surgery was complex, dangerous, and tense, but it was successful after 7 hours.

Life is limited, and it is not easy to reach the age of 80. Over 40 years of medical practice, I have presided over and participated in nearly 10,000 surgeries. I do not know if this is the last one. During the rounds, little Guo Lei called me "Grandpa Hu," and seeing the child's recovered face, I felt very happy.

This is the happiness of a doctor, and it is also the happiness of a Communist. Looking back on my life, the greatest happiness is that from the religiously illusory Eden to the "Eden" of building the People's Republic of China, I have finally realized my true life ideal.

### 我心中的“伊甸园”

    我心中的“伊甸园”
    胡明道
    从虔诚的基督教徒到自豪的共产党员，从国民党军队的军医到人民解放军的军官，我在坎坷的历程中寻到了人生的真谛，也寻到了我心中的“伊甸园”。
    70年前，我在牧师的祝福声中降生于一个基督教徒的家庭，7岁参加了教堂的唱诗班。每当我唱起赞美诗，童稚的心就在默默祈祷：愿天下博爱，愿人类幸福，愿世界成为美丽的伊甸园……
    然而，旧中国何曾有博爱，何曾有人民的幸福。10岁那年，我曾与父亲一起走访贫民窟，那真是一个悲惨的世界。老人枯瘦的躯体和孩子饥饿的目光，给我留下了永难忘怀的印象。
    我曾幻想走“医学救国”的道路。40年代初，我从日本学医毕业回国，成了国民党军队北平陆军联勤总医院的军医。但报国的热情很快被无奈的情绪取代。对国民党政府和军队的腐败愤怒之余，又感到一介儒医回天乏力的悲哀。国民党统治一片黑暗，童年所访的“贫民窟”触目皆是，哪里寻得着一片“伊甸园”！1949年1月31日，我们跟随傅作义将军一道起义，脱下了国民党的军服，戴上了人民解放军的红星。觉醒了的我，终于在中华人民共和国的曦光中获得了新生。
    从此，我把自己的命运紧系于人民共和国——我心中的“伊甸园”。1951年，我报名来到朝鲜战场，参加手术队。反侵略战争之火，把我们为人民战斗的心燃得通亮。曾记得，当年出车救运伤员都是在晚上。公路是一条模糊的白带，救护车在炸得坑坑洼洼的路上奔行，随时有栽下山崖的危险，但驾驶员没有一丝犹豫和畏缩；车颠得人骨头都像要散架了，但重伤员们硬是一声不吭；血浆非常紧张，有多少共产党员执意把血浆让给别的伤员先用，有的就此牺牲了自己的生命！在朝鲜战场一年多，每一件小事都在震撼我。那种为了一个崇高的目标团结一心、亲密无间、无私忘我的境界，是即使一个虔诚的基督教徒也无法比拟的呵！
    我要加入共产党，坚决跟党走。这是我心底的呐喊、崭新的追求。1954年，北京军区总医院党委任命我为胸外科主任。我心情愉快地工作着。党为了照顾起义的知识分子，给我定了地方卫生六级，我谢绝了，甘愿接受军队行政级别待遇，每月减少70多元的工资——我要学习共产党员甘愿吃亏、为国分忧的精神。1958年，我终于加入了中国共产党，实现了崇高的愿望。
    建国初，我国肺结核病人特别多，其中不少人要作肺切除手术。50年代末，有一天我走过北京氧气厂，忽然有个瘦弱的年轻人喊我，一边嘘嘘地喘着气。经他提醒，我才想起他叫张立新，几年前我给他做过肺切除手术。当时他是个18岁的棒小伙，现在却只能看大门了。有些病人肺切除之后，虽然控制了病情，但是胸内遗留较大残腔，余肺逐渐膨胀，迫使纵膈移位，又出现了气喘、肺疝、代偿性肺气肿等症状。我把这个临床难题作为科研课题进行攻关。经过18年的观察、研究，终于创造出“胸膜成形术”。这项成果，荣获全军科技成果二等奖。许多病人用这种方法施行手术后，身体恢复良好。几年来，我带领医务人员研究成功11项科技成果，撰写出50余篇学术论文，制作出3000余幅教学幻灯资料，为进一步治疗及攻克胸科疑难疾病打下了基础。辛勤的工作，酬予我真正的人生乐趣。
    现在，我已70岁了，对于一个拿手术刀的医生来说，已是高龄。8月底，我刚为一个7岁的孩子郭磊做了胸腔肿瘤摘除手术。手术复杂、危险、紧张，7个小时之后，成功了。
    人生有涯，古稀不易。从医40多年，我主持和参与的手术约有近万例。我不知道，这是不是最后一次了。查房时，小郭磊笑着叫我“胡爷爷”，看到孩子恢复生气的面容，我感到十分快乐。
    这是一个医生的快乐，更是一个共产党员的快乐。追抚平生，最大的快乐是，从宗教空幻的伊甸园到人民共和国建设中的“伊甸园”，我终于实现了真正的人生理想。
