Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, August 31st.

The spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated this afternoon at a press conference that the improvement of the current state of Sino-American relations depends on the policies and actions of the U.S.

In response to a journalist's question, the spokesperson said that currently, there are some difficulties in Sino-American relations. These difficulties are due to the U.S. deeply interfering in China's internal affairs and leading the so-called sanctions against China, which have infringed upon China's interests and dignity. The responsibility lies with the U.S. side.
