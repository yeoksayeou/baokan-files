Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, September 14th.

The Soviet Union will take emergency measures to alleviate the current tight supply situation in the consumer market. Heavy industrial enterprises will quickly shift to producing daily necessities, increase investments in agriculture, food, and light industry, and borrow loans from abroad.

Bunich, Deputy Chairman of the Economic Reform Commission of the Supreme Soviet, said at an international seminar in Moscow on September 14th that these emergency measures mainly include: a batch of heavy industrial enterprises will quickly shift to producing daily necessities, increase investments in agriculture, food, and light industry, and borrow loans from abroad.

Bunich said that the Supreme Soviet meeting, scheduled to begin on September 25th, will consider a series of important laws: the "Property Law," "Lease Law," "Land Law," and "Tax Law." He believes that the most important task is to pass these laws and implement them starting next year.

Since this year, the Soviet Union has taken some measures to improve the supply of consumer goods, but the situation has not improved and has instead worsened. Currently, many daily necessities such as sugar, soap, detergent, toothpaste, and cigarettes are out of stock. On September 9th, Soviet leader Gorbachev announced in a televised address to the nation that the government is formulating a series of emergency measures to improve the consumer market and will submit them to the Supreme Soviet for consideration.

    新华社莫斯科9月14日电苏联最高苏维埃经济改革问题委员会副主席布尼奇14日表示，苏联准备采取一系列紧急措施，以缓解目前消费市场的紧张状况。
    据塔斯社报道，布尼奇在莫斯科举行的一次国际讨论会上讲话时说，这些紧急措施主要包括：一批重工业企业迅速转向生产日用品，增拨对农业、食品和轻工业的投资，从国外贷款和借债。
    布尼奇说，定于本月25日开始举行的苏联最高苏维埃会议准备通过一系列重要法律：《所有制法》、《租赁法》、《土地法》、《税收法》。他认为，最主要的任务是通过这些法律，并从明年起付诸实施。
    今年以来，苏联为改善消费品供应状况已采取了一些措施，但是，迄今形势没有好转，相反有所恶化。现在市场上糖、肥皂、洗衣粉、牙膏等许多日用品以及香烟均已脱销。苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫本月9日在对全国的电视讲话中已宣布，政府正在制定一系列改善消费市场的非常措施，并将提交最高苏维埃会议审议。
