Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 21st.

The Asian Basketball Federation has announced that starting from January 1 next year, professional players will be allowed to participate in the Asian Basketball Championship, the Asian Games, and other competitions.

The Asian Basketball Federation's Central Council held a two-hour meeting today at the Beijing Friendship Hotel to discuss various issues. Chairman Cheng Wancui stated that the decision to allow professional players to participate starting January 1 has been finalized. Regarding the principle of allowing foreign players to participate, the general guidelines have been established, but the specific timing and details still need to be discussed.

Chinese Basketball Association Chairman Mou Zuoyun said that allowing professional players to compete in Asia poses a significant threat to the Chinese men's basketball team but will also have a driving effect. It is estimated that teams from the Middle East, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, will actively recruit professional players. The coach of the Philippine team explicitly told reporters that he will bring professional players to participate in the Asian Games.

On April 7 this year, the International Basketball Federation held a representative meeting in Munich, Germany, and decided to allow professional basketball players to participate in the Olympics, continental games, championships, and other competitions.

    亚洲篮联做出新规定
    职业球手明年可参加亚洲比赛
    据新华社北京9月21日电　（记者曲北林）亚洲篮球联合会主席程万琦今天说，从明年1月1日起，亚洲篮球锦标赛、亚运会等比赛将允许职业选手参赛。
    亚洲篮球联合会中央局今天在北京友谊宾馆召开两个小时的会议讨论一系议题。程万琦说，关于从1月1日起允许职业选手参赛的事已成定局。至于，允许外籍球员参赛的原则也已经确定，但具体的时间与细则尚需讨论。
    中国篮球协会主席牟作云说，在亚洲允许职业球员参赛对中国男篮构成了很大威胁，但也会产生推动作用。估计西亚的沙特阿拉伯、科威特等队，会积极招募职业选手入队。菲律宾队教练明确告诉记者，他将带职业选手来参加亚运会。
    今年4月7日，国际篮球联合会在联邦德国慕尼黑召开代表大会时做出决定，允许职业篮球选手参加奥运会、洲运会、锦标赛等。
