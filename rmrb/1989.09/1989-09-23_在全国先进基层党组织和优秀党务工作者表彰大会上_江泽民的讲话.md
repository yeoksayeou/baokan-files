Comrades,

Today, several comrades from the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and Comrades Jiang Zemin, Wan Li, Wang Zhen, and Ren Rong are meeting with you. First, we come to congratulate you, and second, we come to learn from you. This commendation conference is held at an important time when the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee proposed to strengthen Party building. It is a significant event in the Party's life. This conference is both a major review of the achievements in grassroots Party organization building and Party affairs workers' team building over the past few years, and a mobilization meeting to further promote Party building. It is the first time in the history of our country to commend advanced grassroots Party organizations and excellent Party affairs workers on a national scale. The representatives attending this commendation conference are only a part of the millions of advanced grassroots Party organizations and excellent Party affairs workers in the Party. Your advanced deeds are vivid and inspiring, worthy of learning. Over the past few years, you have worked hard to build the Party under the influence of bourgeois liberalization and the serious neglect of Party building by Comrade Zhao Ziyang. You have faced pressure and difficulties, worked hard and steadfastly to build the Party, and achieved hard-won and gratifying results. Your advanced deeds and experiences are a great encouragement to all Party members and also enhance our confidence in further improving Party building. On behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, I would like to express my thanks and respect to you and, through you, to all advanced grassroots Party organizations and excellent Party affairs workers across the country.

Comrades! In a few days, we will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. Over the past 40 years, the socialist cause led by our Party has achieved great achievements recognized by the world. The Party's ranks have continuously grown and strengthened, with the number of Party members increasing from 4.48 million at the founding of the country to over 48 million today. Our Party has become more mature and stronger. In the process of advancing, although our Party has made mistakes and had setbacks, they have all been corrected and resolved through the Party's own efforts with the support of the people. Practice has proven that our Party is truly a great, glorious, and correct party, and the core leadership of the socialist construction cause. It is fully capable of shouldering the historical mission of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. At the same time, we must be soberly aware that our Party is facing the tests of being in power and reform and opening up; the international and domestic hostile forces have not changed their plots to subvert the socialist system and overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, and many comrades in the Party lack the necessary vigilance; under the conditions of reform and opening up, bourgeois ideology is constantly eroding the Party's body, leading to the growth of negative and corrupt phenomena within the Party, and the tendency to detach from the masses is developing, seriously affecting the Party's high prestige among the people. This grim reality tells us that whether we can build our Party well or not is not only related to the rise and fall of the Party but also to the success or failure of the four modernizations and reform and opening up. Therefore, we must seriously summarize and learn from the experiences and lessons, and make up our minds to govern and rectify our Party well, restore the Party's high prestige among the people, and give full play to the political advantages of our Party, leading the people of all nationalities across the country to advance along the socialist road to victory.

Historical experience proves that Party building must be closely centered around the Party's political line and serve the Party's political line. If we deviate from this guiding ideology, Party building will lose its correct direction; the Party's political line will also be difficult to implement correctly. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the basic line and development strategy formulated by our Party are correct. However, due to Comrade Zhao Ziyang's serious neglect of Party building, the role of grassroots Party organizations has been weakened, and the Party's basic line has not been fully implemented. This profound lesson must be firmly remembered.

To strengthen Party building, we must adhere to the fine traditions of Party building and actively explore new experiences in building the Party under new conditions. In the long-term struggle of leading the Chinese revolution and construction, our Party has formed many fine traditions, such as putting the Party's ideological building in the first place in Party building, adhering to the three major styles of linking theory with practice, maintaining close ties with the masses, and criticizing and self-criticizing, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, hard work, and wholeheartedly serving the people, etc. All these are the Party's precious spiritual wealth and the source of strength and wisdom of Chinese Communists. Any attempt to sever history, take a nihilistic attitude, or use the pretext of "reform" to negate the Party's fine traditions is wrong. The great cause of reform and opening up and socialist modernization construction has injected vitality into Party building and also brought about many unprecedented new situations and problems. While inheriting and carrying forward the Party's fine traditions, we must take Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, strengthen investigation and research, summarize new experiences, and do a good job of Party building in the new period, enriching and developing Marxist theories on Party building in practice.

The victory of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion has created more favorable conditions for us to smoothly implement the general policy of reform and opening up. In the future, the reform of the economic and political systems will continue to be carried out firmly. However, all these reforms must be conducive to strengthening and improving the Party's leadership and consolidating and improving the socialist system. The fundamental purpose of separating Party and government functions is not only to "establish a strong government working system" but also to strengthen and improve the Party's leadership. The idea that "separating Party and government" is "separating Party and government" or that separating Party and government is to strengthen government functions and weaken the Party's leadership and the political core role of grassroots Party organizations is wrong.

To strengthen Party building, we must seriously implement the principle of "the Party managing the Party." Each level of the Party committee must put Party building in the first place in its work and include it in the important agenda. The Party committee secretary must regard strengthening Party building as his primary responsibility and devote his main energy to Party building. It should be seen that after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, the atmosphere of strengthening Party building has been formed. The "Notice on Strengthening Party Building" recently issued by the Central Committee has made specific arrangements and clear regulations for the current and future Party building. These provide favorable conditions for us to do a good job of Party building. All levels of Party organizations and all Party members must concentrate their energy and be full of confidence to do a good job of Party building in ideology, organization, and style, and must achieve results.

Broad Party affairs workers have a particularly important responsibility for doing a good job of Party building. They should be faithful executors of the Party's line, principles, and policies, propagandists and organizers of the Party's correct propositions to the masses, demonstrators of the Party's fine traditions and styles, and active participants and promoters of reform and opening up. I hope that all Party affairs workers across the country can be like the comrades commended at this conference, be loyal to the Party's cause, be enthusiastic about Party affairs work, continuously improve their own qualities, learn and master new skills, and make new contributions to strengthening Party building with their exemplary actions.

Comrades, the current situation is good, but there are also many difficulties and problems, and there are many things to be done. The task is glorious and arduous. I believe that as long as all Party members closely unite around the Party Central Committee, enhance their confidence, overcome difficulties, and work hard and practically to do a good job of Party building, the Party's appeal, cohesion, and combat effectiveness will definitely be greatly enhanced, and the socialist modernization construction led by our Party will definitely be invincible.

I wish you all new and greater achievements in your work!

    在全国先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表彰大会上
    江泽民的讲话
    （一九八九年九月二十二日）同志们：
    今天，政治局常委会的几位同志和尚昆、万里、王震、任穷同志与大家见面，一来是向大家表示祝贺，二来是向同志们学习。这次表彰大会，是在党的十三届四中全会提出大力加强党的建设的重要时刻召开的一次重要会议，是党的生活中的一件大事。这次会议，既是对近几年党的基层组织建设和党务工作者队伍建设成绩的一次大检阅，也是进一步推动党的建设的一个动员会。在全国范围内表彰先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者，这在建国以来还是第一次。参加这次表彰会的代表，只是全党千万个先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者的一部分，大家的先进事迹生动感人，值得学习。几年来，你们在资产阶级自由化思想泛滥，赵紫阳同志严重忽视党的建设的情况下，顶着压力，排除困难，理直气壮、脚踏实地地抓党的建设工作，取得了令人可喜而又来之不易的成绩。你们的先进事迹和经验，对全党同志是个巨大的鼓舞，同时也增强了大家进一步搞好党的建设的信心。我代表党中央向你们，并通过你们向全国的先进基层党组织和优秀党务工作者表示感谢和敬意。
    同志们！再过几天，就迎来了中华人民共和国成立四十周年。四十年来，我们党领导的社会主义事业取得了举世公认的伟大成就，党的队伍不断发展壮大，党员人数由建国初期的448万发展到今天的4800多万，我们的党越来越成熟起来，越来越坚强有力。我们党在前进过程中，虽然犯过错误，有过失误，但都是靠党自身的力量，在人民群众的支持下得以纠正和解决的。实践证明，我们党不愧为伟大、光荣、正确的党，不愧为社会主义建设事业的领导核心，完全有能力肩负起建设有中国特色的社会主义这一历史重任。同时又要清醒地看到，我们党面临着执政和改革开放的考验；国际国内敌对势力颠覆社会主义制度、推翻共产党的领导的图谋一直没有改变，党内许多同志对此又缺乏应有的警惕；在改革开放的条件下，资产阶级思想时刻侵蚀着党的肌体，使党内消极腐败现象有所滋长，脱离群众的倾向有所发展，严重影响了党在群众中的崇高威信。这种严峻的现实告诉我们，能不能把我们党建设好，不仅关系到党的兴衰，而且关系到四化建设和改革开放的成败。因此，必须认真总结和汲取经验教训，下决心把我们党治理好、整顿好，重新树立党在人民群众中的崇高威信，充分发挥我们党的政治优势，带领全国各族人民沿着社会主义道路胜利前进。
    历史经验证明，党的建设必须紧紧围绕党的政治路线来进行，为党的政治路线服务。如果偏离这个指导思想，党的建设就没有正确的方向；党的政治路线也难以得到正确的贯彻执行。十一届三中全会以来我们党制定的基本路线和发展战略是正确的。但是，由于赵紫阳同志严重忽视党的建设，使党的基层组织的作用受到削弱，使党的基本路线未能全面地贯彻执行。这一深刻教训，必须牢牢记取。
    要加强党的建设，必须坚持党的建设的优良传统，积极探索在新的形势下搞好党的建设的新经验。在我们党领导中国革命和建设的长期斗争中，形成了许多优良传统，譬如，要把党的思想建设放在党的建设的首位，要坚持理论联系实际、密切联系群众、批评与自我批评三大作风，要发扬自力更生、艰苦奋斗、全心全意为人民服务的革命精神，等等。所有这些，都是我们党的宝贵的精神财富，也是中国共产党人力量和智慧的源泉。任何割断历史，采取虚无主义的态度，借口“改革”而否定党的优良传统的做法，都是错误的。改革开放和社会主义现代化建设的宏伟事业，为党的建设注入了活力，也出现了许多前所未有的新情况和新问题。在继承和发扬党的优良传统的同时，要以马列主义、毛泽东思想为指导，加强调查研究，总结新的经验，搞好新时期党的建设，在实践中丰富和发展马克思主义的建党学说。
    取得制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的胜利，为我们顺利执行改革开放的总方针，创造了更为有利的条件。今后，经济体制和政治体制的改革，仍要坚定不移地进行下去。但是，所有这些改革，都要有利于加强和改善党的领导，有利于巩固和完善社会主义制度。实行党政职能分开，其根本目的，既是为了“建立强有力的政府工作系统”，也是为了加强和改善党的领导。那种认为“党政分开”是“党政分家”；或者认为党政分开是为了加强政府职能，削弱党的领导和基层党组织政治核心作用的思想，都是错误的。
    加强党的建设，要认真执行“党要管党”的原则。各级党委，必须把党的建设放在自己工作的首位，列入重要议事日程。党委书记要把抓党的建设作为自己的首要职责，把主要精力放在党的建设上。应当看到，十三届四中全会以后，加强党的建设的大气候已经形成。中央最近发出的《关于加强党的建设的通知》，对当前和今后党的建设做出了具体部署和明确规定。这些，为我们搞好党的建设提供了有利条件。各级党组织和全党同志，都要聚精会神地、信心百倍地抓好党的思想、组织和作风建设，一定要抓出成效来。
    广大党务工作者，对搞好党的建设负有特别重要的责任。他们应当是党的路线、方针、政策的忠实执行者，是把党的正确主张贯彻到群众中去的宣传者和组织者，是党的优良传统和作风的示范者，也是改革开放的积极参加者和推动者。希望全国广大党务工作者都能像这次大会受表彰的同志那样，忠诚党的事业，热心党务工作，不断提高自身的素质，学习和掌握新的本领，以自己的模范行动，为加强党的建设做出新的贡献。
    同志们，当前的形势是好的，困难和问题也不少，需要做的事情很多，任务光荣而艰巨。我相信，只要全党同志紧紧地团结在党中央的周围，增强信心，克服困难，扎扎实实地为搞好党的建设而奋发努力，我们党的号召力、凝聚力、战斗力就一定会大大提高，我们党所领导的社会主义现代化建设事业就一定会无往而不胜。
    祝同志们在工作中取得新的、更大的成绩！
