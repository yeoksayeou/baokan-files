Today at 10:59 AM, the eternally flowing Minjiang River was successfully diverted.

The Watergate Power Station, with an installed capacity of 1.4 million kilowatts and an average annual power generation of 4.95 billion kilowatt-hours, is located in the Minjiang River's main stream within Minqing County. It is a project approved by the State Council to utilize World Bank loans and the first large-scale hydropower station in China to adopt an international competitive bidding process for its main body civil engineering construction. The project is constructed by Fujian Hualian Engineering Company in collaboration with Maeda Corporation of Japan, forming the Fujian Huada Joint Venture Engineering Company. Construction began on March 9, 1987. Since then, the power station workers have overcome numerous difficulties, diligently guarding their posts, and have completed 54.5 million cubic meters of earth and stone excavation for the open-channel system and main body engineering above water, as well as 3 million cubic meters of concrete pouring. After passing the national acceptance inspection, the diversion began at 8:00 AM on September 24.

Today's successful diversion marks the beginning of the full-scale construction of the main body engineering. According to the plan, the Watergate Power Station is scheduled to start generating power with its first unit by May 31, 1993, and all seven units will be operational by May 31, 1995.

    全部采用国际招标形式建设
    福建水口电站截流成功
    本报水口9月25日电　记者张铭清报道：今天10时59分，千古奔流的闽江被拦腰截断。
    装机140万千瓦，年均发电量49.5亿度的水口水电站位于闽江干流闽清境内，是国务院批准利用世界银行贷款项目，也是我国首次对大型水电站主体土建工程全部采用国际竞争招标方式进行建设的项目，由福建华联工程公司与日本前田建设工业株式会社组成的福建华田联营工程公司中标承建。1987年3月9日正式开工后，广大水电职工克服困难，坚守岗位，已完成明渠系统工程和主体工程水上部位基础开挖545万立方米土石方和30万立方米混凝土浇筑任务。经国家验收委员会验收批准，于9月24日8时开始截流。
    今天截流的实现，标志着主体工程即进入全面施工阶段。按计划，水口电站于1993年5月31日第一台机组发电，至1995年5月31日，七台机组全部发电。
