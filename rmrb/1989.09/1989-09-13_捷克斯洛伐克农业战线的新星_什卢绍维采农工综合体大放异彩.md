This was an unforgettable day. I was invited to visit the Shluhovice Agricultural-Industrial Complex, which is renowned as the new star of the Czechoslovak agricultural front.

After a journey of over five hours, I arrived in Shluhovice, approximately 300 kilometers from Prague. As soon as I stepped out of the car, I was astonished by the sight of this complex nestled in the mountains. Modern, aesthetically pleasing residential buildings, large food markets, luxurious hotels, clubs, and sports halls presented themselves, giving the impression of a modern small city and providing a refreshing experience.

The predecessor of the agricultural-industrial complex was the Shluhovice Agricultural Cooperative. Among the more than a thousand agricultural cooperatives in Czechoslovakia, this small mountain community was once obscure. However, since the young engineer Chuba took over as the chairman of the cooperative in 1963, it has risen to the forefront of the nation's agricultural cooperatives. Chairman Chuba said that the key to Shluhovice's success lies in pursuing reform and comprehensive development.

Upon taking office, he boldly implemented a series of reforms. First, he began by rectifying labor discipline. Those who were late for work had their pay deducted for a day, and those who drank alcohol during work hours were fined 500 koruna. Members could leave the cooperative, but the cooperative would no longer accept them as members.

While rectifying labor discipline, he also paid attention to continuously strengthening and improving the management of the cooperative. He implemented a system of appointing officials, selecting capable individuals to take on leadership roles. To ensure supervision of officials, the cooperative conducted quarterly evaluations of officials' performance in completing production plans, adopting technological achievements, caring for the lives of employees, solving practical problems, and decision-making capabilities. The evaluations were scored, and officials' salaries were differentiated based on their scores. Outstanding performers could be promoted, while those who were unqualified had to be reassigned or demoted. While reforming the official system, he also reformed the cooperative's wage system, linking members' wages to their labor achievements. Promotions were not based on age but on actual work performance, which motivated both officials and members.

These reforms promoted the rapid development of Shluhovice, with the total output value increasing from 50 million koruna in 1960 to over 40 billion koruna in 1988, an increase of nearly 80 times. The cooperative, which was once a natural village, has developed into a large-scale complex with 17 villages, over 8,000 hectares of land, 120 large agricultural machines, and 200 trucks.

While developing agriculture, Shluhovice also vigorously developed rural industries. On the land of the complex, surrounded by cypress trees and rolling hills, there are factories equipped with first-class equipment from the 1980s. These factories produce large combine harvesters, seeders, and dozens of other large agricultural machines, high-quality small computers, and delicious fruit juices.

The fruit juice factory of the complex introduced a modern production line from Sweden through compensatory trade, capable of processing 200 tons of fruit per day and night, recovering the investment in approximately three years. The plastic factory introduced plastic product machines from Austria, using plastic waste as raw materials to produce various white plastic buckets, supplying the domestic market and exporting to Austria. Shluhovice established a small computer factory in 1982, producing 40 computers in the same year. After several years of hard work, production rapidly developed, reaching 40,000 units in 1988 with a production value of over 6 billion koruna, instantly becoming the largest small computer manufacturer in the country and a pillar industry of the complex. Currently, the ratio of industrial and agricultural output values in the complex is 6:1.

The people of Shluhovice place great importance on scientific research and the application of technological achievements. They independently developed 35 types of biological and chemical drugs for agricultural production, including herbicides, pesticides, and biological protection agents, which are exported to Comecon countries and some Western countries. In 1988, the total output value of biological and chemical drugs reached 12 billion koruna, accounting for approximately one-third of Shluhovice's total output value.

Shluhovice also values agricultural production research, implements scientific farming, and carries out rational large-scale production. In 1988, the yield per hectare of crops reached 6.21 tons, catching up with the level of some agriculturally developed countries such as the United States and Japan.

The people of Shluhovice value technological progress and pay more attention to the cultivation of scientific and technological talents. In this complex with 3,300 agricultural workers, 810 have received secondary education, 326 have received higher education, and 17 have obtained the degree of associate professor of science. Currently, respecting science and adopting technological achievements have become the basic policy for Shluhovice's future development. Shluhovice is like a brilliant gem, shining brightly on the land of Czechoslovakia.

　　捷克斯洛伐克农业战线的新星——
    什卢绍维采农工综合体大放异彩
    孙希有
    这是难忘的一天，我应邀参观了被誉为捷克斯洛伐克农业战线的新星的什卢绍维采农工综合体。
    经过5个多小时的行程，我来到距布拉格约300公里的什卢绍维采。一下汽车，我就被这位于山区的综合体景象惊呆了。一幢幢造型美观的住宅楼、大型食品商场、豪华气派的旅馆、俱乐部、体育馆展现在眼前，犹如一个现代化的小城市，给人以耳目一新的感觉。
    农工体的前身是什卢绍维采农业合作社。在捷上千个农业合作社中，这个山区的小社过去默默无闻。但自年轻的工程师丘巴1963年担任合作社主席后，这个合作社便脱颖而出，走在全国农业合作社的前列。丘巴主席说，什卢绍维采成功的关键是走改革和全面发展的道路。
    他一上任便毅然采取大胆的改革措施。首先从整顿劳动纪律开始，上班迟到者停薪一天，工作期间酗酒罚款500克朗，社员可以离社，但合作社不再接受其为社员。
    在整顿劳动纪律的同时，他还注意不断加强和完善合作社的管理，对干部实行聘任制，选拔有能力的人担任领导人。为确保对干部的监督，合作社每个季度对干部完成生产计划、采用科技成果、关心职工生活、解决实际问题的能力和决策水平进行考察。考察实行记分制，并根据得分体现干部的工资差别，成绩优异者可晋升，不合格者要调离或降职。在实行干部制度改革的同时，还改革了合作社工资制度，把社员的工资同劳动成果联系起来。晋级不按年龄而凭实际工作水平，调动了干部和社员的积极性。
    这些改革措施促进了什卢绍维采的生产迅速发展，总产值从1960年的5000万克朗增加到1988年的40多亿克朗，增长了近80倍。合作社由一个自然村发展成为拥有17个村8000多公顷土地、120台大型农机、200辆卡车的大型综合体。
    什卢绍维采在发展农业的同时，还大力发展乡村工业。在翠柏环抱、丘陵起伏的综合体土地上，拥有80年代一流设备的工厂，能生产出大型康拜因收割机、播种机等几十种大型农业机械、质量优良的小型计算机、香甜可口的果汁等产品。
    综合体果汁厂以补偿贸易的形式从瑞典引进现代化生产线，昼夜可加工水果200吨，大约3年便可收回投资。塑料厂从奥地利引进塑料制品机，利用塑料废料作原料，加工成各种洁白的塑料桶，供应国内市场和向奥地利出口。什卢绍维采1982年建立了小型计算机厂，当年便生产出40台计算机。经过几年的奋斗，生产迅速发展，1988年产量达4万台，产值6亿多克朗，一举成为全国最大的小型计算机厂家，成为综合体的支柱工业。目前，综合体的工业和农业产值的比例为6∶1。
    什卢绍维采人十分重视科研和采用科技成果。他们自己研制出35种用于农业生产的生物药品和化学药品，其中除草剂、杀虫剂和生物保护剂出口到经互会和西方一些国家。1988年，生物和化学药剂的总产值达12亿克朗，约占什卢绍维采总产值的1／3。
    什卢绍维采还重视农业生产科研，实行科学种田，进行合理化大生产。1988年每公顷农作物产量达6.21吨，赶上了美国、日本等一些农业生产发达国家的水平。
    什卢绍维采人重视科技进步，更注意对科技人才的培养，在这个共有3300名农业职工的综合体里，受过中等教育的有810人，受过高等教育的有326人，获得科学副博士学位的有17人。目前，尊重科学，采用科技成果，已成为什卢绍维采今后发展的基本方针。什卢绍维采犹如一颗璀璨的明珠，在捷克斯洛伐克大地上大放光彩。（附图片）
