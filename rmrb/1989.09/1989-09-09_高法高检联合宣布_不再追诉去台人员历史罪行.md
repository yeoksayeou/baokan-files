Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, September 9th.

The Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate today announced that individuals who went to Taiwan will not be prosecuted for historical crimes committed after the founding of the People's Republic of China but before the establishment of local people's governments.

Previously, in March 1988, the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued a notice stating that individuals who went to Taiwan would not be prosecuted for crimes committed before the founding of the People's Republic of China. It was reported that this notice had a significant impact both domestically and internationally and was widely welcomed. Many insightful individuals and former Nationalist Party military and government personnel residing overseas sent letters and made statements praising this as a wise move to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland. However, some former Nationalist Party military and government personnel still had concerns about visiting the mainland for family visits or tourism and inquired whether they would be prosecuted for crimes committed after the founding of the People's Republic of China but before the establishment of local people's governments.

At a press conference held today by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, an important new notice regarding the handling of historical crimes by former Nationalist Party military and government personnel was read out. Vice Procurator-General Liang Guoqing of the Supreme People's Procuratorate explained that after the founding of the People's Republic of China on October 1, 1949, some provinces or regions had not yet been liberated, and local people's governments had not yet been established. During this period, some individuals committed crimes in these regions, which are considered historical crimes. The policy has always been to handle historical crimes leniently. For former Nationalist Party military and government personnel who committed crimes on the mainland, all have been pardoned or treated leniently since 1982. Now, it has been decided that individuals who went to Taiwan will not be prosecuted for crimes committed after the founding of the People's Republic of China but before the establishment of local people's governments, which reflects this spirit. At the same time, for individuals who went to Taiwan and whose crimes continued or were ongoing after the establishment of the people's government, the statute of limitations for prosecution is calculated from the end of the criminal behavior. If the statute of limitations has expired, they will not be prosecuted. For crimes with a maximum penalty of life imprisonment or death, after 20 years, they will not be prosecuted. If prosecution is deemed necessary, it will be approved by the Supreme People's Procuratorate.

In response to a question from a reporter from this newspaper about how to understand the phrase "if prosecution is deemed necessary, it will be approved by the Supreme People's Procuratorate," Vice President Zhu Mingshan of the Supreme People's Court said that this is a clear provision of the criminal law, and the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate have no authority to modify it. However, in judicial practice over the years, some former Nationalist Party military and government personnel with historical crimes who returned to the mainland for family visits and tourism were all warmly received, and there were no cases of them being prosecuted by judicial authorities for their historical crimes. He reiterated that for compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as overseas Chinese, who return to the mainland for family visits and tourism, and for economic and cultural exchanges, their personal, property, and other legal rights will be genuinely protected. He also hoped that the Taiwanese authorities would take action to develop economic and cultural exchanges across the Taiwan Strait and promote two-way, equal exchanges between people on both sides.

Today, it was also confirmed at the press conference that the spirit and basis of the two notices issued by the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's Procuratorate also apply to former Nationalist Party military and government personnel residing in places other than Taiwan around the world.

### 高法高检联合宣布  不再追诉去台人员历史罪行

    高法高检联合宣布
    不再追诉去台人员历史罪行
    本报北京9月9日讯　记者毛磊、张志业报道：最高人民法院和最高人民检察院今天宣布：对去台人员在中华人民共和国成立后、犯罪地地方人民政权建立前所犯历史罪行，将不再追诉。
    在这以前，去年3月，高法、高检曾发布不再追诉去台人员在中华人民共和国成立前的犯罪行为的公告。据介绍：该公告在海内外引起很大反响，受到普遍欢迎。一些有识之士和现居住在海外各地的原国民党军政等人员纷纷来信和发表谈话，盛赞这是促进祖国和平统一的明智之举。但是，一部分原国民党军政等人员对回大陆探亲、旅游还存有顾虑，来信询问在中华人民共和国成立后、当地人民政权建立前的犯罪是否追诉的问题。
    在由最高人民法院和最高人民检察院今天联合召开的新闻发布会上，宣读了上述有关处理国民党军政等人员的历史罪行的一项新的重要公告。最高人民检察院副检察长梁国庆对此解释说，1949年10月1日中华人民共和国成立后，尚有部分省或地区没有解放，地方人民政权还没有建立，有关人员在此期间，在这些地区所犯罪行属于历史罪行。对历史罪行我们历来采取处理上从宽的政策。对于在大陆犯有罪行的原国民党军政人员，已于1982年全部赦免或宽大处理。现在，决定对去台人员在中华人民共和国成立后、当地人民政权建立前的犯罪行为不再追诉，也体现了这一精神。同时，对去台人员犯罪行为连续或继续到人民政权建立后的，根据我国刑法规定，追诉期限从犯罪行为终了之日起计算，已超过追诉期限的，不再追诉。法定最高刑为无期徒刑、死刑的犯罪，经过20年，也不再追诉。认为必须追诉的，由最高人民检察院核准。
    在回答本报记者提出的如何理解“必须追诉的，由最高人民检察院核准”这个问题时，最高人民法院副院长祝铭山说，这是刑法明确规定的，高法和高检无权对此进行修改。但是，在司法实践上，这些年来一些有历史罪行的原国民党军政人员回祖国大陆探亲旅游，均受到了热情的接待，没有出现因为他们的历史罪行而被司法机关追诉的情况。他再次重申对回大陆探亲旅游，开展经济、文化交流的台、港、澳同胞和海外侨胞，将切实保护他们的人身、财产和其他合法权益，并希望台湾当局对发展海峡两岸经济、文化交流和两岸人员双向对等的往来，有所作为。
    记者今天还从新闻发布会上获得证实，高法和高检这两个公告的精神以及所依据的理由，同样适用于居住在台湾以外的世界其他地方的原国民党军政等人员。
