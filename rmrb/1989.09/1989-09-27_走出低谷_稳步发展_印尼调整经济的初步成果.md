This year marks the first year of Indonesia's execution of its fifth five-year plan (1989–1994), and the economy has shown a good trend of development. According to reports, it is expected that Indonesia's total export volume this year will increase from last year's $18.7 billion to $20.3 billion; the inflation rate has dropped from 10% in 1987 to the current 5%; and the gross domestic product will increase by 4% on the basis of $67 billion in 1988. In recent years, Indonesia has taken a series of measures to overcome the economic difficulties brought by the drop in international oil prices and has made a comprehensive adjustment to the economy, gradually changing the export structure that has relied mainly on oil to earn foreign exchange for the past 20 years. The above-mentioned achievements have been made in this context.

Since Indonesia began implementing its first five-year plan in 1969, especially during the 10 years from 1971 to 1981, industrial and agricultural production developed rapidly. In the 1960s, Indonesia's oil production was only over 20 million tons, but by 1981 it had reached 78 million tons, making Indonesia one of the world's top ten oil-producing countries, ranking sixth. The value of industrial products increased by 14% each year, agricultural output increased by 4% each year, and the gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 8%. In 1971, Indonesia's per capita GDP was only $90, making it one of the poorest countries in the world. By 1980, the per capita GDP had reached $430 (and $500 in 1986).

However, since 1982, the price of oil on the international market has continued to fall, especially the sharp drop in 1986, which dealt a heavy blow to Indonesia's economy. In 1986, Indonesia's oil export volume increased by 10% compared to 1985, but the total amount of foreign exchange earned actually decreased by 20%. The difficulties that followed included a significant depreciation of the Indonesian rupiah (31% in 1986), a sluggish investment climate, increased debt, and a sharp rise in unemployment. Faced with this reality, the Indonesian government began implementing a comprehensive economic adjustment plan in December 1987, with the following main measures:

Adjusting the export product structure. In the past, the export value of petroleum products accounted for 75% of Indonesia's total exports, but this has gradually decreased to 40% in recent years. The export value of non-oil products has also been increasing year by year, from $6.7 billion in 1986 to $9 billion in 1987, and $11.3 billion in 1988.

Actively developing the production of non-oil products, mainly textiles, machinery, electrical equipment, food, and timber. In the textile production sector, attention has been paid to improving management, enhancing product quality, and increasing the variety of designs, thus making the products competitive in the international market. Currently, Indonesia has 1.5 million textile workers and 10,000 looms. The export value of textiles reached $1.8 billion in 1988, a ninefold increase over 1983.

Simplifying the approval procedures for setting up businesses and allowing multinational companies to invest in local enterprises or operate directly. Over the past few years, Indonesia has attracted a total of $21 billion in foreign investment. The Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board estimates: "Indonesia will be able to attract $3-4 billion in foreign investment each year in the next few years." This undoubtedly injects momentum into Indonesia's development of new production sectors.

Other measures include promoting family planning to control population growth and developing labor-intensive industries to increase employment.

International opinion generally believes that Indonesia's economy has emerged from the difficult trough and has begun to develop steadily on a new basis. However, the road ahead for Indonesia is not smooth, and there are still many difficulties, such as the decline in oil income and foreign exchange earnings, intense competition in the international market, difficulties in exporting products, debt burden, population growth, and serious unemployment problems. The Indonesian government has formulated specific measures in the "Five-Year Plan" to overcome the above difficulties. The preliminary results achieved this year indicate that Indonesia has the ability to overcome the current difficulties and further develop its economy.

Last year, President Suharto predicted that if the "Five-Year Plan" is successfully implemented, by the end of the "Six-Year Plan" (i.e., 1998), the per capita GDP will reach $1,000, and at that time, Indonesia will enter the ranks of newly industrialized countries.

	Indonesia actively develops plywood production, replacing timber exports with plywood, thus increasing the export of non-oil products and solving part of the unemployment problem. The picture shows the production workshop of the Andatu plywood factory in South Sumatra.

    走出低谷　稳步发展
    ——印尼调整经济的初步成果
    鲍世绍
    今年是印度尼西亚执行第五个五年计划（1989—1994年）的头一年，经济发展出现了良好的势头。据报道，预计印尼今年的出口总额可由去年的187亿美元增长到203亿美元；通货膨胀率已从1987年的10％下降到目前的5％；国内生产总值将在1988年的670亿美元的基础上增加4％。近几年来，印尼为了克服国际石油跌价带来的经济困难，采取了一系列措施，对经济作了全面调整，逐渐改变了20年来主要依赖石油赚取外汇的出口结构。上述的可喜成果正是在这种背景下取得的。
    自从1969年印尼开始执行第一个五年计划以来，特别是在1971—1981年的10年间，工农业生产迅速发展。60年代，印尼石油产量只不过2000多万吨，1981年达到了7800万吨，使印尼成了世界十大产油国之一，名列第六位。工业制成品产值每年递增14％，农业产值递增4％，国内生产总值以每年8％的速度上升。1971年，印尼的人均国民生产总值才90美元，是世界最贫困国家之一，到1980年，人均国民生产总值达到430美元（1986年为500美元）。
    然而，1982年以来，国际市场石油价格不断下降，特别是1986年的暴跌，给印尼经济以重大打击。1986年，印尼石油出口量比1985年增长了10％，但换得的外汇总金额反而减少了20％。由此而延伸的困难有：印尼盾大幅度贬值（1986年贬值31％）、投资不景气、债务加重、失业人数剧增等等。面对这一现实，印尼政府于1987年12月开始实行一个一揽子计划，全面调整经济，其具体做法主要有：
    调整出口产品结构。过去石油产品出口额在印尼出口总额中占75％，近年来已逐渐下降到40％。非石油产品的出口额也逐年增加，1986年只有67亿美元，1987年增加到90亿美元，1988年则达到113亿美元。
    积极发展非石油产品的生产。主要有纺织、机械、电力设备、食品和木材等。在纺织品生产方面，注意改进经营管理，提高产品质量，增加花色品种，从而使产品在国际市场有竞争力。目前，印尼有150万纺织工人，织布机1万台。纺织品出口额1988年就达到18亿美元，比1983年增长了9倍。
    简化了办企业的批准手续，允许外国的多国公司在当地企业中投资或直接开业。在过去几年中，印尼总共吸收了210亿美元的外资。印尼投资协调委员会估计：“印尼在今后几年里每年将可获得30—40亿美元的外资”。这无疑为印尼开发新的生产领域注入了动力。
    还有推广计划生育以控制人口增长、发展劳动密集型的工业以增加就业人数等。
    国际舆论普遍认为，目前印尼经济已走出了困难的低谷，开始在新的基础上稳步发展。不过，摆在印尼面前的道路并不平坦，困难还有不少，如石油收入和外汇收入在下降，国际市场竞争激烈，产品出口不易，债务负担，人口增长和失业问题仍然严重等等。印尼政府在“五·五”计划中，对克服上述困难都制订了具体措施。今年所取得的初步成果表明，印尼有能力克服眼前的困难，使经济进一步得到发展。
    苏哈托总统去年预言，如胜利实现“五·五”计划，到“六·五”计划末（即1998年），人均国民生产总值将达到1000美元，那时印尼将进入新兴工业国家的行列。
