In the east side of Tiananmen Square, on the side of Justice Road, stands a newly built high-rise building. In front of the building hangs a large national emblem. This is the highest judicial organ of our country—the Supreme People's Court.

Recently, reporter Su Ning interviewed the President of the Supreme People's Court, Ren Jianxin.

President Ren studied chemical engineering at Peking University in his early years. Later, due to his participation in underground party activities, he was pursued by the Kuomintang and, according to the party organization's decision, went to the liberated area. Although he is not a graduate of a law school, he has long been engaged in legal work. He has participated in the legislation of New China in the Central Political and Legal Affairs Committee, the Central Commission for Legal Affairs, the State Council Legal Affairs Office, and other units. Later, he worked in the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, mainly engaged in international trade arbitration and maritime arbitration and other foreign-related legal work. To this day, he is still the honorary chairman of these two arbitration commissions and is known as a renowned international law expert both domestically and internationally. In 1983, he became the Vice President of the Supreme People's Court.

When talking about his own experience, President Ren smiled and said, "When I first came to the city, I still wanted to return to my original chemical engineering field. I never expected to become involved with law and end up working in it for a lifetime."

At this point, President Ren introduced to the reporter the historical process of the people's courts over the past 40 years. He said, "The people's courts of our country were established on the basis of overthrowing the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, abolishing the pseudo-legal system, and thoroughly smashing the old state machine, in accordance with the provisions of the Common Program. Over the past 40 years, it has been established with the birth of the republic and developed with the prosperity and strength of the republic. In the early days of the founding of the nation, the people's courts were part of the local people's government and were led by the local people's government. In 1954, the first constitution of our country established the system of people's congresses as the political system of the state. The people's courts and the people's governments were elected and supervised by the people's congresses at the same level, and were responsible to them and reported their work. This was a major reform of the people's court system, thereby establishing the important position of the people's courts in the constitution and the state machinery, which is of great significance for strengthening socialist democracy and legal system, and for ensuring that the people's courts independently exercise judicial power. After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Party, the construction of socialist democracy and legal system flourished. The 1982 Constitution reaffirmed and developed the system, principles, and judicial system of the people's courts. The Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, General Principles of Civil Law, Civil Procedure Law (trial), Administrative Procedure Law, and other basic laws and many important laws were promulgated and implemented in succession. From then on, the people's courts had legal basis for handling cases from litigation principles, judicial system to judicial procedures. Under such circumstances, the people's courts entered a new period of comprehensive development. Criminal, civil, economic, maritime, administrative, and complaint and appeal cases in various judicial works were fully carried out, and a socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics has been established. The important position and role of the people's courts in the political, economic, and social life of the state have become increasingly apparent."

President Ren Jianxin said, "In the early days of the founding of the nation, there were only 25,000 judicial personnel nationwide, but now there are 220,000, more than 8 times that of the early days of the founding of the nation, and the cultural and professional structure has undergone great changes. At present, except for the Supreme People's Court, there are a total of 3,219 local people's courts at various levels nationwide, including 30 higher people's courts, 336 intermediate people's courts, and 2,853 basic-level people's courts; 126 specialized people's courts, including 56 military courts, 6 maritime courts, and 64 railway transport courts.

Over the past 40 years, courts at all levels have accepted more than 40 million first-instance cases of various types, including more than 15.8 million criminal cases and more than 25.29 million civil cases. Since the reform and opening up in 1979, judicial work has been fully carried out, not only have a large number of criminal and civil cases been concluded, but also 1.78 million economic dispute cases have been concluded, with a total amount of nearly 52 billion yuan in dispute; maritime and maritime commercial cases have been concluded 1,772 times since 1985; administrative cases have been concluded 19,062 times since 1987. The above judicial activities have strongly consolidated the state power of people's democratic dictatorship, effectively protected the legitimate rights and interests of the state, collectives, and citizens, and played an important role in ensuring and promoting the completion of the central tasks of the Party and the state in each historical period, and the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy."

As an expert in international trade and maritime arbitration, President Ren presided over the establishment of China's maritime judicial work. Since the establishment of the maritime courts in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other six places in November 1984, the number of cases accepted has been increasing year by year, with more than 30 types of cases, of which 10% are foreign-related cases. The parties involved in foreign-related cases come from 35 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa, and North and South America, and some of the parties involved in the cases are foreigners. When handling foreign-related cases, the maritime courts adhere to the principles of seeking truth from facts, fairness and reasonableness, and equal application of laws for domestic and foreign parties, safeguarding China's judicial jurisdiction and maritime order, protecting the marine environment and the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese and foreign parties, promoting the development of China's shipping industry and foreign economic and trade, and winning reputation at home and abroad.

When talking about his term goals and plans, President Ren said: "My term goal is to carry forward the past and open up the future, and to continuously improve the socialist judicial system with Chinese characteristics."

President Ren happily told the reporter that the political and professional qualities of the judicial personnel have always been relatively good. Due to historical reasons, in the past, the average number of judicial personnel with a bachelor's degree or above nationwide was only about 10%. Now, through channels such as the establishment of a judicial personnel part-time legal university and the China High-level Judges Training Center, more than 30,000 judicial personnel have passed the bachelor's degree graduation examination in just one year in 2018; more than 40,000 trainees are receiving bachelor's degree education or legal (judicial) professional certificate education; more than 100 trainees are furthering their studies or pursuing a master's degree at the High-level Judges Training Center.

President Ren went on to say, "With the decisive factor of 'people,' we also need a series of systems, such as public trials, defense, recusal, collegial panel, and appeals, among which the core is the public trial system. Now, isn't the focus of anti-corruption on openness and transparency? Public trials are the highest form of openness and transparency in court work. By doing so, some actual problems in some places, such as the network of relationships, the practice of seeking favors, and the abuse of power for personal gain, will naturally disappear. Of course, this is a test for the judges as well as all participants in the trial, including prosecutors and lawyers. Therefore, public trials can not only eliminate bad practices but also promote the improvement of the quality of judicial personnel. We are currently summarizing experiences and further fully implementing the public trial system. This is one of the focuses of our judicial work improvement in the next period."

President Ren Jianxin finally said with great ambition: "The court's future work and reforms have a lot to do. We must firmly establish the guiding ideology of the court serving 'one center, two basic points,' and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the supervision of the people's congress, further comprehensively carry out various judicial work, continuously improve the level of law enforcement, improve the conditions for serious law enforcement, so as to better play the role of the judicial organ, more effectively protect the people, punish crimes, promote reform, and serve the four modernizations."

    继往开来  任重道远
    ——建国四十周年前夕访最高人民法院落院落长任建新
    本报记者苏宁
    在天安门广场东侧正义路旁，有一座新建的高楼，楼前正中悬挂着一枚巨大的国徽，这里就是我国最高审判机关——最高人民法院。
    日前，记者采访了最高人民法院院长任建新。
    任院长早年曾在北京大学学习化学工程，后因参加地下党活动遭国民党通缉，根据党组织的决定到了解放区。他虽不是法律科班出身，却长期从事法律工作，先后在中央政法委员会、中央法制委员会、国务院法制局等单位参加了新中国的立法工作。此后，他在中国国际贸易促进委员会任职，从事的也主要是国际贸易仲裁和海事仲裁等涉外法律工作，至今他还是这两个仲裁委员会的名誉主席，称得上是国内外知名的国际法专家。1983年，任最高法院副院长。
    谈起自己的经历，任院长笑着说，我刚进城时还总想回到我的化工本行，没想到却跟法律结下了不解之缘，一干就是一辈子。
    说到这里，任院长向记者介绍了人民法院40年来的历史进程。他说，我国人民法院是在推翻国民党的反动统治，废除伪法统，彻底打碎旧的国家机器的基础上，依照《共同纲领》的规定建立起来的。40年来，它随着共和国的诞生而创建，随着共和国的繁荣兴旺而发展。建国初期，人民法院是同级人民政府的组成部分，受同级人民政府领导。1954年，我国第一部宪法确立了国家的政治制度为人民代表大会制度，人民法院和人民政府都由同级人民代表大会选举产生，受它监督，向它负责并报告工作。这是人民法院体制上的重大改革，从而确立了人民法院在宪法和国家机构中的重要地位，对于加强社会主义民主和法制，保障人民法院独立行使审判权，具有重要的意义。党的十一届三中全会以后，社会主义民主和法制建设蓬勃发展。1982年宪法重新肯定和发展了人民法院的体制、审判原则和审判制度。刑法、刑事诉讼法、民法通则、民事诉讼法（试行）、行政诉讼法等基本法和许多重要法律相继颁布实施。从此，人民法院审判案件从诉讼原则、审判制度到审判程序都有了法律依据。在这样的形势下，迎来了人民法院全面发展的新时期。刑事、民事、经济、海事、行政、告诉申诉各项审判工作全面开展，具有中国特色的社会主义审判制度已经建立起来。人民法院在国家的政治生活、经济生活和社会生活中的重要地位和作用越来越明显地表现出来。
    任建新院长说，建国初期，全国法院干警只有2.5万人，而现在则达到22万人，是建国初期的8倍多，文化、专业结构发生了很大的变化。目前，全国除最高人民法院外，共设有地方各级人民法院3219个，其中高级人民法院30个，中级人民法院336个，基层人民法院2853个；专门人民法院126个，其中军事法院56个，海事法院6个，铁路运输法院64个。
    40年来，各级人民法院共受理各类一审案件4000多万件，其中刑事案件1580多万件，民事案件2529多万件。1979年改革开放以后审判工作全面开展，不仅审结了大量的刑事、民事案件，还审结了新出现的经济纠纷案件178万件，争议诉讼标的金额近520亿元；海事、海商案件从1985年以来5年内审结1772件；行政案件1987年以来，2年半审结19062件。上述审判活动有力地巩固了人民民主专政的国家政权，有效地保护了国家、集体和公民的合法权益，对各个历史时期党和国家中心任务的完成，对改革开放政策的实施，起了重要的保障和促进作用。
    作为国际贸易和海事仲裁方面的专家，任院长主持创建了我国的海事审判工作。上海、广州等6个海事法院自1984年11月成立以来，收案数逐年增加，案件类型多达30多种，其中涉外案件占10％，涉外案件的当事人涉及亚、欧、非、南北美洲的35个国家，其中一些案件的当事人都是外国人。海事法院在审理涉外案件时，坚持实事求是，公平合理，国内外当事人在适用法律上一律平等的原则，维护了我国的司法管辖权和航运秩序，保护了海洋环境和中外当事人的合法权益，促进了我国航运事业和对外经济贸易的发展，在海内外赢得了信誉。
    在谈到任期内的规划、设想时，任院长说：我的任期目标，就是继往开来，使具有中国特色的社会主义审判制度不断完善。
    任院长高兴地告诉记者，法院审判人员队伍的政治、业务素质一直是比较好的。由于历史的原因，过去全国法院干部平均大专学历以上的只有10％左右。现在通过创办法院干部业余法律大学、中国高级法官培训中心等渠道，仅去年一年就有3万多法院干部通过了大专结业考试；四万多名学员正在接受大专学历教育或《法律（审判）专业证书》教育；100多名学员正在高级法官培训中心进修深造或者攻读硕士学位。
    任院长接着说，有了“人”这个决定性的因素，还要有一系列的制度，例如公开审判、辩护、回避、合议、上诉等，这其中最核心的是公开审判制度。现在廉政建设不是讲公开性和透明度么？公开审判就是法院工作公开性和透明度的最高形式。这样做了，一些地方实际存在的一些不正之风，如关系网、说情风、徇私舞弊等必将不攻自破。当然，这对法官以及所有庭审参加者，包括检察官、律师等的素质都是一场考验。因此，公开审判既能杜绝不正之风，又能促进审判人员素质的提高。我们正在通过总结经验，进一步全面执行公开审判制度。这是我们今后一段时期内改进审判工作的一个重点。
    任建新院长最后雄心勃勃地说：法院今后的工作和改革是大有文章可做的，要牢固树立法院为“一个中心，两个基本点”服务的指导思想，在中国共产党的领导和人大的监督下进一步全面开展各项审判工作，不断提高执法水平，改善严肃执法条件，以便更好地发挥审判机关的职能作用，更有效地保护人民，惩治犯罪，促进改革，服务四化。
